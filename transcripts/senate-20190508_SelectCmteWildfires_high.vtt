00:13:29.875 --> 00:13:31.243
THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND AROUND

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.578

DAY IN OFFICE -- INITIATED WHAT

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.091
WAS WHAT IS CALLED A INNOVATION

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.927
PROCUREMENT SPRINT.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.461
AND THE DIRECTOR WAS REALLY

00:13:49.528 --> 00:13:51.463
FOCUSED ON BRINGING THE BEST

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.232

AND WE'VE YOU KNOW CONTRACTING

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:03.842
REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:06.212
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS SEES SO

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.680
THAT WE COULD BEGIN PILOTING

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:09.548
THESE TECHNOLOGIES AS EARLY AS

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:12.151
THIS SUMMER -- AND THAT IS --

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:14.820
THAT IS ON TRACK.

00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:16.922
OBVIOUSLY PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S --

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.892
FIVE RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS IS --

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.794
MANIFEST IN HIS PROPOSED BUDGET --

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.529
THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY AND

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:24.663
I HAVE MORE INFORMATION I CAN

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.131
PROVIDE ON THAT BUT SINCE YOU

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.166
ALL HAVE REVIEWED THAT AND

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:28.567
ARGUING THAT RIGHT NOW I WON'T

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.269
GO INTO THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL.

00:14:30.336 --> 00:14:32.137
BUT IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT --

00:14:32.204 --> 00:14:33.505
THE THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.741
THE GOVERNOR SIGNED AB SEVENTY

00:14:35.808 --> 00:14:37.076

IN THESE WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES --

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.804
OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE MOST

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:19.405
VULNERABLE I HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:19.972
BUILT.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:21.940
AND SO WE ARE FOCUSED ON

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:24.209
INCREASING OR EXPANDING PROGRAMS

TO HELP -- HOMEOWNERS IN BONOBO

00:17:26.645 --> 00:17:29.248
COMMUNITIES HEART IN THEIR HOMES --

MECHANISM.

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.526
THAT WOULD ALLOW -- FOR

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:43.095
HOMEOWNERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES --

00:17:43.162 --> 00:17:43.962
TO IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY IN

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.564
THEIR HOMES.

00:17:45.631 --> 00:17:47.966
WE ALSO IS THE REPORT -- POINTS

OUT THAT NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL

00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:51.203
COMMUNITIES TO UPDATE AND

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.971
STRENGTH AND LOCAL EMERGENCY

00:17:53.038 --> 00:17:54.173
PLANS.

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:57.176
EVACUATION ROUTES IDENTIFICATION

00:17:57.242 --> 00:18:00.946
OF ESSENTIALLY -- SAFE HAVENS IF

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:02.748
RESIDENTS CAN'T EVACUATE. NE OF

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:04.683
THE LESS TOLD STORIES OF

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.119
PARADISE IS IT WAS ACTUALLY --

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:09.888
RELATIVELY -- WELL PREPARED TOWN

00:18:09.955 --> 00:18:11.457
AS IT RELATES TO CATASTROPHIC

00:18:11.523 --> 00:18:13.025
WILD FIRE AND IT ACTUALLY

00:18:13.091 --> 00:18:14.760
DRILLED -- WITH ITS ITS

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:17.262
RESIDENTS ON EVACUATION ROUTES.

00:18:17.329 --> 00:18:18.964
AND SOME ARGUE THAT FATALITIES

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:20.432
WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH HIGHER HAD

00:18:20.499 --> 00:18:22.434
THOSE EVACUATION ROUTES NOT BEEN

00:18:22.501 --> 00:18:24.803
PRE PLANNED -- AND PRE

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.739
COMMUNICATED WITH RESIDENTS.

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:29.741
AND IF AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.076
MUCH WORSE HAD THERE NOT BEEN

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.878
ESSENTIALLY CLEARANCE PROJECTS

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:35.714
OF VEGETATION ON ON EITHER SIDE

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:37.282
OF THOSE EVACUATION ROUTES.

00:18:37.349 --> 00:18:38.517
SO WE EED TO ENSURE THAT ALL

00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:40.252
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.787
HAVE THOSE EMERGENCY PLANS AND

00:18:41.854 --> 00:18:44.289
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ACTUALLY I

00:18:44.356 --> 00:18:45.958
UNDERSTAND THOSE -- AND THAT

00:18:46.024 --> 00:18:48.060
THEIR INSTITUTIONALIZED -- AN

00:18:48.126 --> 00:18:50.729
UPDATED REGULARLY -- MORE CAN BE

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:52.998
DONE TO ENHANCE COMMUNICATION A

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.800
NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS -- AND

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:55.667
THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT STATE

00:18:55.734 --> 00:18:56.902
STANDARDS SET ON THAT AND WE

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:58.270
NEED TO ENSURE THE

00:18:58.337 --> 00:18:58.904
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE

00:18:58.971 --> 00:18:59.671
STANDARDS.

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:01.974
SO THAT -- IT RESIDENTS ACTUALLY

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.909
LEARN ABOUT FIRES -- FROM THEIR

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:06.578
CELL PHONES OR IN WAYS -- THAT'S

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:08.480
EASILY ACCESSIBLE.

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.282
AND THEN -- THE REPORT GOES ON

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:12.251
TO TALK ABOUT -- IMPROVED LAND

USE PRACTICES -- TO REDUCE FIRE

00:19:14.453 --> 00:19:16.822
THREATS -- CHANGING HOW HIGHER

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.323
RISK AREAS ARE DESIGNED TO

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:21.793
COMMUNITIES.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.395
AND SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW HOUSE

00:19:23.462 --> 00:19:24.696
TO DISCUSS THE SENSITIVE TOPIC

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:26.765
OF APPROPRIATE GROWTH WHERE

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:28.033
GROWTH SHOULD OCCUR.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.101
IS A DYNAMIC TENSION BECAUSE

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.536
LAND USE AUTHORITY RESTS WITH

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.938
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- BUT AS THE

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.073
REPORT POINTS OUT IT'S AN

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.608
OPPORTUNE TIME TO DISCUSS.

00:19:36.675 --> 00:19:39.578
REALLY HOW HOW TIME COMMUNITY

00:19:39.645 --> 00:19:41.780
SHOULD SHOULD GROW OUTWARD --

00:19:41.847 --> 00:19:44.349
GIVEN THIS FIRE RISK -- AND THEN

00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:46.351
LASTLY -- CONTINUING HIGH AT TWO

00:19:46.418 --> 00:19:47.719
OF ALL HOW WE ASSESS BONE

00:19:47.786 --> 00:19:51.123
ABILITY OF OF OF COMMUNITIES.

00:19:51.189 --> 00:19:53.191
ARE THAT THAT CAL FIRE FORTY

00:19:53.258 --> 00:19:54.660
FIVE DAY REPORT TOOK PHYSICAL

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:57.362
FIRE RISK BUT THEN ALSO OVERLAID

00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.864
IT WITH OUR COMMUNITIES AT OUR

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:00.032
CONCERTS CONSTRAINED BY

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:01.500
EVACUATION ROUTES.

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:02.701
AND PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE

00:20:02.768 --> 00:20:04.503
GIVEN DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE AGE AND

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.971
INFIRMITY AND WE STE WE NEED TO

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.573
CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:10.542
COMMUNITIES ARE MOST VULNERABLE.

00:20:10.609 --> 00:20:11.043
SO WE CAN FOCUS ON THOSE

00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:11.743
COMMUNITIES.

00:20:11.810 --> 00:20:12.744
THIRD AREA RECOMMENDATIONS IN

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:14.680
SECTION ONE IMPROVING AND

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:15.547
EXPANDING FORCE MANAGEMENT AND

00:20:15.614 --> 00:20:19.451
HEALTH -- AS I TOLD IT FROM OUR

00:20:19.518 --> 00:20:21.353
PERSPECTIVE AS I SHARED -- YOU

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:22.254
KNOW THE FORCE LOOKS VERY

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:23.589
DIFFERENT THAN IT DID TWO

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:24.723
HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.558
AND WE NEED TO DO --

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:27.859
COLLECTIVELY A LOT MORE

00:20:27.926 --> 00:20:29.294
MANAGEMENT IN THE FOREST IN

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.096
TERMS OF VEGETATION THEN WE HAVE

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.966
IN THE PAST -- A LARGE PLAN IN

00:20:34.032 --> 00:20:34.900
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS CALLED

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:37.803
THE FORCE CARBON PLAN CALLS

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:39.605
450-010-00 ACRES OF FOREST

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:40.672
MANAGEMENT A YEAR.

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.974
AND THIS FORCE MANAGEMENT HAS TO

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.275
BE APPROPRIATE WE'RE NOT TALKING

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:44.576
ABOUT INDISCRIMINATE LOGGING

00:20:44.643 --> 00:20:45.310
THIS IS.

00:20:45.377 --> 00:20:47.012
SCIENTIFICALLY DRIVEN FORCE

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.847
MANAGEMENT -- THAT HELPS

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.583
FOREST'S US STAY HEALTHY AND AND

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:52.784
FIRE SAFE.

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.820
THE GOOD NEWS IS SINCE TWENTY

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:56.688
TEN WE'VE -- DOUBLE THE AMOUNT

00:20:56.755 --> 00:20:59.358
OF LAND THAT WE ARE MANAGING AND

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.859
TRIPLE THE AMOUNT THAT WERE WERE --

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.361
MANAGING BY PRESCRIBED FIRE THE

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.429
PROBLEM IS WE'RE GONNA MEET THAT

00:21:04.496 --> 00:21:05.764
CARBON THAT FORCED CARBON BY

00:21:05.831 --> 00:21:08.133
PLAN GOAL WE HAVE TO INCREASEBY

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.067
TEN ACTS.

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.370
OF THE AMOUNT OF OF LAND THAT

00:21:11.436 --> 00:21:13.071
WERE -- THAT WE'RE MANAGING YOU

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:14.873
ALL HAVE LEAD CALLING FOR ONE

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.241
BILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT IN

00:21:16.308 --> 00:21:18.276
FORCE MANAGEMENT OVER THE NEXT

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.212
FIVE YEARS -- THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:21:20.278 --> 00:21:21.747
APPOINTED A NEW CHAIR OF THE

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.582
GOVERNOR'S FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.684
FORCE -- SUPERVISOR FROM PLASTER

00:21:25.751 --> 00:21:28.120
COUNTY NAME JENNIFER MONTGOMERY

00:21:28.186 --> 00:21:28.687
WHO'S REALLY GOING TO DRIVE

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:29.321
ACTION.

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:30.589
TOWARDS THESE FORCE MANAGEMENT

00:21:30.656 --> 00:21:32.791
GOALS WHICH WILL INCLUDE --

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:34.559
WORKING WITH PRIVATE LANDOWNERS

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:36.161
IN CREATING INCENTIVES TO

00:21:36.228 --> 00:21:37.562
ACTUALLY GET THIS FUEL OUT OF

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.398
THE FOREST -- WHETHER IT'S BIO

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:42.067
MASS OR THE MASS TIMBER INDUSTRY.

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:43.969
OR ENVIRONMENTALLY APPROPRIATE

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.904
ECONOMY -- THAT CAN ACTUALLY

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.273
HELP IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.375
CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO MANAGE

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.743
FORESTS.

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.878
AND IN ORDER TO DO THIS WORK WE

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.979
ACTUALLY AFTER A IMPROVING

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:56.014
EXPAND WORKFORCE TRAINING WE DO

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:57.315
NOT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO

00:21:57.382 --> 00:21:58.350
THIS WORK RIGHT NOW.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.152
I AM SO WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

00:22:00.218 --> 00:22:02.721
ACTUALLY BUILDING UP THAT HUMAN

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:04.923
CAPACITY -- IN OUR IN OUR TOWNS

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.925
ACROSS THE STATE WHICH BY THE

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.894
WAY CREATE A GREAT ECONOMIC.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.529
OPPORTUNITY. FOR RURAL

00:22:10.595 --> 00:22:12.264
COMMUNITIES.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:12.964
AND THEN LASTLY AS IT RELATES TO

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:14.800
FORCE MANAGEMENT HEALTH WE NEED

00:22:14.866 --> 00:22:16.968
TO REALLY STAND TOP OF THE BEST

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:17.536
SCIENCE WE NEED TO DO THIS

00:22:17.602 --> 00:22:19.204
CAREFULLY -- THERE ARE

00:22:19.271 --> 00:22:20.739
ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS AND GROUPS

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:22.674
THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:24.142
SCALE OF FORCE MANAGEMENT THAT

00:22:24.209 --> 00:22:25.377
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.545
UNDERSTAND THAT.

00:22:26.611 --> 00:22:28.013
AND SO WE NEED TO ACTUALLY

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.282
MANAGE FOREST AND TAKE SO CALLED

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:31.550
FUEL OUT OF THE FOREST CAREFULLY.

00:22:31.616 --> 00:22:34.720
I IN A VOID IMPACTS --

00:22:34.786 --> 00:22:35.320
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT ARE

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:36.188
NEGATIVE.

00:22:36.254 --> 00:22:37.255
AND THEN THE FOURTH CATEGORY

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.590
WHICH WILL PROBABLY SPEND MOST

00:22:38.657 --> 00:22:39.658
OF THE TIME TALKING ABOUT TODAY

00:22:39.725 --> 00:22:41.026
IT'S REALLY BUILDING SAFER

00:22:41.093 --> 00:22:42.794
UTILITIES AS IT RELATES TO WILD

00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.096
FIRE RISK.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:46.231
AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW ACCORDING

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:47.365
TO DATA FROM CAL FIRE

00:22:47.432 --> 00:22:49.668
INVESTIGATIONS ABOUT 10% OF

00:22:49.735 --> 00:22:52.237
WILDFIRES -- IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:22:52.304 --> 00:22:53.839
STARTED -- AS A RESULT OF

00:22:53.905 --> 00:22:55.140
ELECTRICAL IGNITIONS OR

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.608
IGNITIONS FROM ELECTRICAL

00:22:56.675 --> 00:22:58.510
EQUIPMENT BUT 10%.

00:22:58.577 --> 00:22:59.878
MOST OF THOSE WITHIN THAT 10%

00:22:59.945 --> 00:23:01.446
ARE ELECTRIC UTILITIES JUST

00:23:01.513 --> 00:23:02.848
BECAUSE UTILITIES HAVE MOST OF

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:04.616
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:06.585
SO OBVIOUSLY ONE IMPORTANT

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:09.387
ELEMENT OF REDUCING WELFARE RISK

00:23:09.454 --> 00:23:10.288
IS.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:11.823
BUILDING SAFER UTILITY

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:13.325
INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFER UTILITY

00:23:13.391 --> 00:23:14.793
MANAGEMENT.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.595
THE I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE AREAS

00:23:16.661 --> 00:23:19.097
OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN SECTION

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:20.866
ONE FIRST IS -- STRENGTHENING

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:22.067
THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE WILD

00:23:22.134 --> 00:23:23.869
FIRE MITIGATION PLANS WHICH AS

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.036
YOU KNOW ARE FAIRLY NEW

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.404
REQUIREMENT FOR INVESTOR OWNED

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:27.439
UTILITIES.

00:23:27.506 --> 00:23:28.840
BY CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.243
THOSE SO THAT I THAT THE

00:23:31.309 --> 00:23:32.944
GOVERNMENT CAN ACTUALLY OVERSEE

00:23:33.011 --> 00:23:34.846
SAFETY PLANS FROM THE UTILITIES

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:36.715
THAT ARE ADEQUATELY ROBUST TO

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.016
ADDRESS THE THREAT.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.185
SECOND IS ENSURE THE UTILITIES

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:42.454
ACTUALLY INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:43.789
AND MONITORING.

00:23:43.855 --> 00:23:45.524
MANY OF TALKED ABOUT THE THE

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.225
WORK THAT SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.327
DID AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

00:23:49.394 --> 00:23:50.829
FIRES I IN TERMS OF PROTECTIVE

00:23:50.896 --> 00:23:52.364
WHETHER A MONITORING.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:53.365
THAT HAVE REALLY PROVEN TO BE

00:23:53.431 --> 00:23:54.766
FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL FOR THAT

00:23:54.833 --> 00:23:56.234
UTILITY AS IT RELATES TO

00:23:56.301 --> 00:23:58.670
AVOIDING -- UTILITY CREATED

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:00.005
FIRES.

00:24:00.071 --> 00:24:01.439
AND THEN LASTLY -- ANOTHER

00:24:01.506 --> 00:24:02.841
CATEGORY IN THE SECTION IS

00:24:02.908 --> 00:24:04.576
ALIGNING INCENTIVES FOR

00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:06.011
UTILITIES WITH SAFETY.

00:24:06.077 --> 00:24:07.512
IN OTHER WORDS CONDITIONING A

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:09.447
RETURN ON IN EQUITY THAT THE C.

00:24:09.514 --> 00:24:13.685
P. U. C. ALLOW IS ON IT WITH

00:24:13.752 --> 00:24:14.853
WILD FIRE SAFETY PERFORMANCE --

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.655
SO THAT UTILITIES THE INVESTOR

00:24:16.721 --> 00:24:18.123
OWNED UTILITIES THAT REALLY.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:22.194
ARE REQUIRED -- TO DELIVER RATE

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.396
PAYER -- INVESTOR BENEFIT

00:24:24.462 --> 00:24:25.831
ACTUALLY THE THEIR INCENTIVES

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:28.133
FOR DOING SO RELY ON PROVIDING

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.635
TOP SAFETY FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.

00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:32.437
HOW CLOSE BY JUST QUOTING THE

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:34.673
ACTUAL THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THE

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:36.441
REPORT THAT I THINK CAPTURES

00:24:36.508 --> 00:24:37.008
WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE

00:24:37.075 --> 00:24:38.577
TODAY?

00:24:38.643 --> 00:24:40.245
IT SAYS WILDFIRE HAS ALWAYS

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:41.413
PLAYED CALIFORNIA.

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.081
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS MADE AND WILL

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:44.449
CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE FIRES

00:24:44.516 --> 00:24:47.118
HOTTER LARGER MORE FREQUENT AND

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.420
MORE DESTRUCTIVE.

00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:49.487
THE COST OF THESE FIRES IS

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:51.056
UNBEARABLE.

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:53.658
THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE PROPERTY

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:55.627
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES COMMUNITY

00:24:55.694 --> 00:24:57.662
LIFE EXACERBATED BY THE COST TO

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.764
REBUILD COMMUNITIES REBUILD

00:24:59.831 --> 00:25:01.666
COMMUNITIES CANNOT BE SUSTAINED.

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.001
MOST IMPORTANTLY IT ENDS WITH

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.836
SAYING THE STATUS QUO IS NOT AN

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:05.871
OPTION.

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:08.974
DOING NOTHING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.342
SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO TIM

00:25:10.408 --> 00:25:12.744
WEIGHING THAN TO TAKE US THROUGH

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:13.812
SECTION TO AND I KNOW.

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:15.213
MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT YOU OF

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.581
REALLY ASK FOR A FOCUS ON

00:25:16.648 --> 00:25:18.617
SECTION ONE IN THREE BUT WE WANT

00:25:18.683 --> 00:25:19.818
TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT ON

00:25:19.885 --> 00:25:22.354
SECTION TO JUST OFFER CONTEXT

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.189
FOR THE DISCUSSION HERE TODAY.

00:25:24.256 --> 00:25:24.990
THERE ARE ENOUGH I WANTED TO

00:25:25.056 --> 00:25:26.625
MAKE SURE THAT -- NO MEMBERS HAD

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:28.093
ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU AFTER.

00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:29.160
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE THAT AND

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:30.862
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM NOW

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:31.329
OUR AT THE END OF THE

00:25:31.396 --> 00:25:34.065
PRESENTATION?

00:25:34.132 --> 00:25:35.033
SIR MORE LOCK.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.635
THANK YOU MISTER.

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:37.936
MISTER CRAWFORD -- YOU HAD

00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:39.604
MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE DOUBLE

00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:41.940
THE LANDOWNER MANAGEMENT FORCED

00:25:42.007 --> 00:25:42.574
AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THAT

00:25:42.641 --> 00:25:43.275
MEANS.

00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:45.010
YES SO CAL FIRE TRACKS THE

00:25:45.076 --> 00:25:47.579
AMOUNT OF ACREAGE -- THAT IS

00:25:47.646 --> 00:25:49.414
THAT IS UNDER TREATMENT FOR

00:25:49.481 --> 00:25:50.682
VEGETATION IN OTHER WORDS

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:52.884
REDUCING BRASCH IN SOME CASES

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:55.287
SMALL DIAMETER TREES IN ORDER TO

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:57.222
PROTECT COMMUNITIES.

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:00.058
HI AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS THE

00:26:00.125 --> 00:26:01.626
AMOUNT OF ACREAGE THAT WE WERE

00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:03.561
ABLE TO TREAT WHAT WE CALL

00:26:03.628 --> 00:26:05.363
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- HOVERED

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.965
AROUND FIFTEEN THOUSAND ACRES

00:26:07.032 --> 00:26:09.901
PER YEAR -- RECENTLY AND I THINK

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:13.238
BELIEVE -- TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIVE

00:26:13.305 --> 00:26:14.873
CAL FIRE WAS ABLE TO EXPAND THE

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.375
AMOUNT OF OF ACRES ARE MANAGED

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:19.210
GETTING THAT YOU KNOW DANGEROUS

00:26:19.277 --> 00:26:20.679
VEGETATION OUT WELL YOU KNOW

00:26:20.745 --> 00:26:23.214
MAINTAINING HEALTHY FORESTS. TO

00:26:23.281 --> 00:26:23.782
ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND

00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:24.616
ACRES.

00:26:24.683 --> 00:26:25.750
AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:27.352
CONTRAST THAT TO OUR GOAL WHICH

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:29.688
IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES.

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:31.389
SO WHILE WE CAN YOU KNOW --

00:26:31.456 --> 00:26:33.358
PROVIDE SOME CREDIT TO CAL FIRE

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:34.192
FOR DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:36.528
ACREAGE WE'RE STILL WELL SHORT

00:26:36.594 --> 00:26:38.229
OF WHERE WE THINK WE NEED TO BE.

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:40.198
ON THE ON THAT TOPIC.

00:26:40.265 --> 00:26:41.700
SO THEN THE ONE BILLION

00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:44.035
INVESTMENT OVER THE NEXT FIVE

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:44.602
YEARS RELATES TO JUST THESE

00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:47.973
ACRES -- NO WE HOPE TO THAT WE

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:49.908
HOPE THAT THAT ONE BILLION SO

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.509
FOR EXAMPLE.

00:26:51.576 --> 00:26:52.410
AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE BUDGET

00:26:52.477 --> 00:26:53.778
ALLOCATES TWO HUNDRED MILLION

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:55.513
DOLLARS THIS YEAR -- A LARGE

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.948
PART OF IT GOES TO VEGETATION

00:26:57.015 --> 00:26:59.250
MANAGEMENT -- WITH THESE THIRTY

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:00.685
FIVE EMERGENCY PROJECTS WE WILL

00:27:00.752 --> 00:27:02.320
MANAGE OVER NINETY THOUSAND

00:27:02.387 --> 00:27:04.756
ACRES THIS YEAR -- AND WE ARE

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:06.591
HOPING THAT THIS -- AMOUNT OF

00:27:06.658 --> 00:27:08.660
FUNDING THIS ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:09.694
AT THAT MANIFESTS OVER FIVE

00:27:09.761 --> 00:27:12.097
YEARS MOVES US TOWARD THAT GOAL

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:13.798
OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES --

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:15.934
HOW HOW CLOSE WE GET TO THAT

00:27:16.001 --> 00:27:17.469
GOAL OR IF WE CAN SUPPRESS THE

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.804
GOLD RELIES ON -- A LOT OF THE

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:21.573
WORK THAT'S UNDER WAY BUT WE'RE

00:27:21.639 --> 00:27:22.707
GONNA HOPE TO GET THAT SORT OF

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:24.042
MAXIMUM BANG FOR THE BUCK

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.577
WITHOUT MONEY AS IT RELATES TO

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.045
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WITHIN

00:27:27.112 --> 00:27:27.779
THAT ACREAGE.

00:27:27.846 --> 00:27:30.215
WE'RE JUST MAKING A SMALL DENT

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:32.217
ON WHAT WE OWN IS THE STATE.

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:34.352
WELL I WOULD SAY -- WE HAVE BEEN

00:27:34.419 --> 00:27:35.920
MAKING A SMALL DENT WE INTEND IT

00:27:38.023 --> 00:27:38.723
I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THAT WE

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.357
HAVE.

00:27:39.424 --> 00:27:41.393
A CRITICAL PARTNER IN -- IN THE

MANAGES ABOUT 57% OF OUR FOREST

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.603

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:40.358
ENERGY POLICIES.

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:41.326
IS IMPORTANT IN LIGHT OF

00:32:41.392 --> 00:32:43.661
CALIFORNIA'S RECENT EXPERIENCE

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:45.430
WITH CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES.

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:47.098
WHICH REINFORCES THE NEED TO

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.866
MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND

TWENTY FORTY FIVE TO DATE

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.192
CALIFORNIA HAS MADE REMARKABLE

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:15.493
PROGRESS TOWARD THESE GOALS.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.729
AS OF LAST YEAR A THIRD OF THE

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:19.664
RETAIL ELECTRIC SALES WITHIN THE

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.566
STATE CAME FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:33:21.632 --> 00:33:23.234
SOURCES.

00:33:23.301 --> 00:33:24.302
AND MORE THAN HALF OF THE SALES

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:26.537
ARE FROM CARBON FREE RESOURCES

00:33:26.604 --> 00:33:28.539
WHICH INCLUDE HYDROELECTRIC AND

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:30.308
NUCLEAR ENERGY.

00:33:30.375 --> 00:33:31.909
IN ADDITION THE RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:33:31.976 --> 00:33:33.745
INDUSTRY HAS GREATLY BENEFITED

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:36.447
CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. TO DATE IT

00:33:36.514 --> 00:33:38.282
HAS CREATED OVER HUNDRED

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:39.517
THOUSAND JOBS WITHIN THE STATE

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.152

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:45.390
WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MUCH MORE

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.191
IN THE FUTURE.

00:33:47.258 --> 00:33:49.227
GOING FORWARD THE STATE NEEDS TO

00:33:49.293 --> 00:33:51.429
BE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:52.663
TO FIZZLE TO FACILITATE

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.065
INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:56.000
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO MEET ITS

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:57.769
AMBITIOUS GOALS.

00:33:57.835 --> 00:34:00.238
WHILE ENSURING RESOURCE ADEQUACY

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:02.974
AND RELIABILITY.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.910
ON THE PAST 2100% CLEAN ENERGY A

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.412
NUMBER OF CHALLENGES HAVE TO BE

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:09.447
OVERCOME.

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:11.682
THE MARKET HAS CHANGED AS

00:34:11.749 --> 00:34:13.551
TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED AND

00:34:13.618 --> 00:34:14.619
RENEWABLE ENERGY COSTS HAVE

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.821
DECLINED.

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.122
NEW ELECTRICITY PROVIDERS HAVE

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:19.924
EMERGED IN THE FORM OF ENERGY

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.726
SERVICE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.995
CHOICE AGGREGATORS.

00:34:24.061 --> 00:34:25.363
DISTRIBUTED GENERATION IS ALSO

00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:27.432
GAINING MARKET SHARE.

00:34:27.498 --> 00:34:28.599
THE RESULT IS THAT THE

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.334
ELECTRICITY MARKETS HAVE BECOME

00:34:30.401 --> 00:34:31.903
MORE FRAGMENTS.

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.771
AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.206
INCREASINGLY BECOMING POLES AND

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.141
WIRES COMPANIES.

00:34:37.208 --> 00:34:38.276
THAT IS THEIR RETAINING THE

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:40.178
ELECTRICITY DELIVERY FUNCTION

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:43.147
AND TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM

ADEQUACY CHALLENGES MAY ARISE.

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.257
AS RENEWABLES GAIN EVER GREATER

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.959
MARKET SHARE THE GREETED WILL

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:56.561
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ACCOMMODATE

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.062
THE INTERMITTENT NATURE OF THEIR

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.465

00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:01.532
NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATION

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:04.635
CURRENTLY PROVIDES RELIABILITY

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:07.071
AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY SERVICES --

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:08.806
BUT AS CALIFORNIA.

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:11.075
APPROACH IS A 100% CLEAN ENERGY

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:12.710
AND NATURAL GAS FIRED GENERATION

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:15.446
IS REPLACED BY RENEWABLES.

00:35:15.513 --> 00:35:16.814
NEW TYPES OF SOLUTIONS WILL PLAY

00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:18.950
A GREATER ROLE.

00:35:19.016 --> 00:35:20.685
THE SOLUTIONS MAY INCLUDE TIME

00:35:20.751 --> 00:35:23.855
OF USE RATES -- DEMAND RESPONSE

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:25.556
ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

00:35:25.623 --> 00:35:28.226
INCREASED REGIONAL COORDINATION.

00:35:28.292 --> 00:35:30.428
ELECTRIC VEHICLE INTEGRATION AND

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:32.864
ELECTRICITY STORAGE.

00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.699
THEY'RE ALSO CHALLENGES THE

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:36.100
RETAIL ELECTRICITY MARKET --

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:37.535
CURRENTLY THE CUSTOMER CHOOSES

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.203
NOT TO OBTAIN SERVICE FROM

COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS AND

00:35:41.572 --> 00:35:44.275
ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.910
WORK THOSE PROVIDERS FAIL --

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:46.944
THEY CAN OBTAIN SERVICE FROM AN

00:35:47.011 --> 00:35:48.513
I. O. U. AS A PROVIDER OF LAST

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:52.383
IF I USE BECOME POLES AND WIRES

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:55.019
COMPANIES THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE

00:35:55.086 --> 00:35:56.387
TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE.

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:57.722
AND AN ALTERNATE PROVIDER OF

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:58.856
LAST RESORT WILL HAVE TO BE

00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:01.225
DESIGNATED.

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:03.060
A DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:04.795
SUCH AS ROOFTOP SOLAR ARE

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.030
GAINING MARKET SHARE THESE

00:36:06.097 --> 00:36:08.366
RESOURCES ARE DESIRABLE BUT THEY

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.001
ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY THE GRID

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.602
OPERATOR LIKE TRADITIONAL

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:13.104

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.605
THE OPERATION OF DISTRIBUTED

00:36:14.672 --> 00:36:16.274
ENERGY RESOURCES WILL HAVE TO BE

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.675
INCREASINGLY MANAGED AND

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:19.744

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:29.153
FUTURE.

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.555
AND CALIFORNIA HELP WILL HAVE TO

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:31.956
ENSURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:34.692

SECTOR BUILDINGS AND

00:36:40.531 --> 00:36:42.300
TRANSPORTATION ALSO NEED TO BE

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.601
DE CARBONIZED.

00:36:43.668 --> 00:36:44.769
VEHICLES BURNING GASOLINE AND

00:36:44.835 --> 00:36:46.270

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:48.706
A THIRD OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:50.575
EMISSIONS WITHIN THE STATE --

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:51.842
CONVERTING THEM TO LECTURE CITY.

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:52.743
IS THE BEST WAY TO TAKE

00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.445
ADVANTAGE OF CARBON FREE

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:56.747

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.452
REFORMS. TO THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:15.986
PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION AND

00:39:16.053 --> 00:39:17.488
THEN WE'LL MOVE TO PARTS THREE

00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:19.390
AND PART FIVE WHICH I KNOW YOU

00:39:19.457 --> 00:39:21.258
WANTED TO FOCUS ON TODAY.

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.494
AS PART OF THE PRESENTATION ON

00:39:23.561 --> 00:39:24.895
PART THREE MR BOLICK FROM PHIL

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.731
SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS WILL ALSO

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.032
PRESENT SOME DATA.

00:39:28.099 --> 00:39:29.567
ON MODELING THE SIZE OF A

00:39:29.633 --> 00:39:31.469
POTENTIAL WILDFIRE FUND WHICH IS

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.070
SOME WORK THAT THE STRIKE FORCES

00:39:33.137 --> 00:39:35.272
DONE SINCE WE COMPLETED THE

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.640
INITIAL REPORT.

00:39:36.707 --> 00:39:38.576
SO WITH REGARD TO PART.

00:39:38.642 --> 00:39:40.177
FOUR THE STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:42.213
IN PART FOUR OF THE REPORT THAT

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:44.915
CPUC REFORM IS NECESSARY IN

00:39:44.982 --> 00:39:46.050
ORDER TO MEET THE CHANGING

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:47.752
DYNAMICS OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:49.186
MARKETS.

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:50.855
THE REPORT RECOMMENDED THAT THE

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.157
STATE EVALUATE A COMPREHENSIVE

00:39:53.224 --> 00:39:55.726
OVERHAUL OF THE CPUC IN AN

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.995
EFFORT TO SERVE IN THE CURRENT

00:39:58.062 --> 00:39:59.463
AND FUTURE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:00.831
RECOGNIZING AND THAT SUCH AN

00:40:00.898 --> 00:40:02.466
OVERHAUL COULD BE A LONGER TERM

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:04.335
PROCESS THE REPORT ALSO

00:40:04.401 --> 00:40:05.102
INCORPORATED SOME

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:06.771
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEAR TERM

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.272
ACTION.

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:09.740
AT A HIGH LEVEL THE STRIKE FORCE

00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:11.976
IDENTIFIED CERTAIN CHALLENGES IN

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:14.645
THE CURRENT CPUC PROCESS.

00:40:14.712 --> 00:40:16.714
THOSE ISSUES FALL ROUGHLY INTO

00:40:16.781 --> 00:40:19.083
THE FOLLOWING BUCKETS.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.751
THE FIRST BUDGET IS THE CPUC

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:22.219
LACKS THE RESOURCES AND

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:24.255
EXPERTISE TO TO ADDRESS ITS

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:25.556
CURRENT SCOPE.

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:27.424
THE CBC'S HISTORIC FUNCTION HAS

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.260
BEEN PRIMARILY AS A RATE SETTING

00:40:29.326 --> 00:40:30.294
BODY.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.329
AND RICH HISTORY THE CBC HAS

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.999
DEVELOPED SUBSTANTIAL EXPERTISE

00:40:35.065 --> 00:40:36.167
IN THE AREA OF RATE SETTING.

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:38.569
BUT RECENTLY THE CPUC HAS BEEN

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.703
CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.173
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS.

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.308
AND ALSO ADDRESSING THE SAFETY

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.977
ISSUES TO PREVENT WILDFIRES.

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.746
AND THE CBC HAS REGULATORY

00:40:48.813 --> 00:40:50.581
RESPONSIBILITY FOR A VARIETY OF

00:40:50.648 --> 00:40:52.683
INDUSTRIES NOT JUST THE ELECTRIC

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.784
ENERGY SECTOR.

00:40:53.851 --> 00:40:55.953
AND AS ITS MANDATE HAS EXPANDED

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.288
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE AREAS OF

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.723
SAFETY THE UNDERLYING EXPERTISE

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:03.060
TO DECEIVE YOU SEE HAS DEVELOPED

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:03.561
IS NOT KEPT UP WITH THAT

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.795
EXPANSION.

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.263
THE SECOND BUCKET OF ISSUES THAT

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:08.199
THE REPORT IDENTIFIED.

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:09.767
IS THE CP UC'S CHOIRS AYE

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.802
JUDICIAL PROCESS WHICH IS NOT

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:14.772
NECESSARILY SUITABLE FOR ALL THE

00:41:14.839 --> 00:41:15.372
FUNCTIONS IT'S BEING ASKED TO

00:41:15.439 --> 00:41:16.407
PERFORM.

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:17.842
THE CBC HAS AN APPROACH TO

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:19.577
RESOLVING ISSUES THAT IS BECAUSE

00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:21.078
I JUDICIAL IN NATURE IT'S A

00:41:21.145 --> 00:41:22.880
HIGHLY STRUCTURED LEGAL PROCESS

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:24.348
THAT INCORPORATES ADMINISTRATIVE

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:26.851
LAW JUDGES SUBSTANTIAL PLEADINGS

00:41:26.917 --> 00:41:28.252
INSUBSTANTIAL HEARINGS.

00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:30.020
THAT PROCESS.

00:41:30.087 --> 00:41:31.789
POTENTIALLY VERY WELL SUITED TO

00:41:31.856 --> 00:41:33.224
TRADITIONAL MARIE RATE MAKING IS

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.892
NOT NIMBLE OR FLEXIBLE AND DOES

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:37.061
NOT NECESSARILY LEND ITSELF TO

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:39.897
POLICY MAKING FUNCTIONS OR

00:41:39.964 --> 00:41:41.332
RAPIDLY CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES.

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.434
THE THIRD A BUCKET OF ISSUES

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:44.702
THAT THE REPORT IDENTIFIED WITH

00:41:44.768 --> 00:41:47.371
THE CP UC'S CURRENT PROCESS.

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:49.173
IS THAT THE CB USY HAS SOME ILL

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.742
DEFINED AND POTENTIALLY

00:41:51.809 --> 00:41:53.677
CONFLICTING MANDATES.

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:55.880
THIS CD UC HAS ALWAYS HAD TO

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.281
BALANCE THE OBLIGATIONS TO

00:41:57.348 --> 00:41:59.583
PROTECT CONSUMERS WITH ITS NEED

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.485
TO ENSURE FINANCIALLY HEALTHY

00:42:01.552 --> 00:42:03.787
UTILITIES THAT CAN MEET

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:05.055
CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS.

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.457
THE EXPANSION OF THE C. B. UC'S

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:08.459
ROLLS INTO AREAS SUCH AS SAFETY

00:42:08.525 --> 00:42:09.960
AND CLEAN ENERGY MEANS THAT THE

00:42:10.027 --> 00:42:12.529
CPUC IS ALSO TAKING ON A BECAUSE

00:42:12.596 --> 00:42:14.431
I POLICY MAKING FUNCTION IN SOME

00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:15.933
OF THOSE AREAS.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.268
AND THAT RESULTS IN A C. B. UC

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:19.370
WITH A VERY BROAD BUT SOMEWHAT

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:21.805
ILL DEFINED AND SOMETIMES

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.540
CONFLICTING SET OF MANDATES.

00:42:23.607 --> 00:42:25.709
HAVING IDENTIFIED THOSE PROBLEMS

00:42:25.776 --> 00:42:27.111
AND HAVING RECOMMENDED THE

00:42:27.177 --> 00:42:29.313
EVALUATION OF LONGER TERM AND

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:30.881
MORE COMPREHENSIVE REFORM.

00:42:30.948 --> 00:42:32.583
THE REPORT ALSO RECOMMENDED NEAR

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:35.653
TERM THE FOLLOWING FOR ACTIONS.

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.621
NUMBER ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:39.790
PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:41.058
TO EXPAND TO THE SAFETY

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.394
EXPERTISE AT THE CPUC.

00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:45.062
OR TO CREATE ANOTHER STATE

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.498
AGENCY WITH THE NECESSARY

00:42:47.564 --> 00:42:49.566
RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE.

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:50.501
THE SECOND.

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.569
RECOMMENDED ACTION WAS AS PART

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.171
OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:55.906
REFORMING THE WILDFIRE LIABILITY

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:57.608
FRAMEWORK WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.009
AS PART.

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.544
THREE THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED

RECOVERY ACTIONS IN THE AREA OF

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.522
WILD FIRE DAMAGES.

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:13.457
HAVING SAID THAT THE REPORT ALSO

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.225
RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO ENSURE

00:43:15.292 --> 00:43:16.794
THAT ANY OVERHAUL OF DECISION

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.629
MAKING PROCESS STILL PROVIDE FOR

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.130
APPROPRIATE PUBLIC INPUT AND

TRANSPARENCY.

00:43:21.465 --> 00:43:23.400
BUT ALLOW IT TO BE DONE ON A

00:43:23.467 --> 00:43:25.202
MORE STREAMLINED BASIS.

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.904
THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IN THE

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:28.806
AREA OF CEBU SEE REFORM WAS THAT

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.844
AND RESEARCH. TO IDENTIFY HIGH

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:36.480
RISK INDUSTRY REGULATORY MODELS

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:37.982
FOR EXAMPLE IN AVIATION.

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:39.850
THAT COULD PROVIDE A BASIS FOR

00:43:39.917 --> 00:43:41.585
LONGER TERM REFORM.

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:43.587
AND FOURTH THAT THE CBC DEVELOP

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.856
BEST PRACTICES FOR UTILITIES

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:48.058
THEY CAN BE A RESOURCE ON ISSUES

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.593
SUCH AS CHANGING TECHNOLOGY.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.495
AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND I

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:52.429
UNDERSTAND THAT AS TO THIS

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:54.398
FOURTH RECOMMENDATION THE CBC

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.266
HAS ALREADY UNDERTAKEN TO MOVE

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.701
THIS FORWARD.

THE CQC HAS AND AND I THINK

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.055
WE'VE RECOGNIZE THOSE AND IT'S

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.089
NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.691
IT TO A LARGE EXTENT IT'S THE

00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.593
RESOURCES THEY POINT TO CHIU SO

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:24.795
ACCURATELY -- CONVEYED ONE OF

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.497
THE ISSUES THOUGH IN TERMS OF

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:28.065
THE QUASI JUDICIAL ROLE.

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:29.400
OF THAT THE FEW SHE HAS THAT

00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:30.834
COULD CHANGE THAT NOW THEY HAVE

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.569
THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT WE

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:33.804
DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.607

WHEN AND WHY THEY HAVEN'T DONE

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:39.476
BUT BABY ALASKA THE

00:44:39.543 --> 00:44:40.878
COMMISSIONERS HERE ON THAT BUT

00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:41.945
THEY DO HAVE THAT BUT MORE

00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:42.846
IMPORTANTLY.

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.615
THERE WAS ALSO IN THE REPORTED

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:46.316
TALKED ABOUT -- TO CULTURE

00:44:46.383 --> 00:44:47.718
DELEGATING MORE ENFORCEMENT

00:44:47.785 --> 00:44:50.154
AUTHORITY TO STAFF -- IS THERE

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.122
ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT THAT YOU

00:44:52.189 --> 00:44:53.390
HAVE WHAT KIND WHAT TYPE OF

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.892
AUTHORITY THAT WAS INCLUDED IN

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.193
THE REPORT THAT YOU WOULD THINK

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.561
THEY SHOULD HAVE MORE OF SO AS I

00:44:57.628 --> 00:45:00.197
UNDERSTAND THE CPUC PROCESS MOST

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.032
OF THE AUTHORITY RESIDES IN THE

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:03.267
ALE J. AND THEN IN THE

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.401
COMMISSIONER WHOSE.

00:45:04.468 --> 00:45:05.936
AND IN CHARGE AND THERE MAY BE

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:06.837
AND THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING I

00:45:06.904 --> 00:45:08.672
THINK PROBABLY BETTER DISCUSSED

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.074
WITH THE CPC BUT THERE MAY BE

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:11.442
WAYS THAT.

00:45:11.508 --> 00:45:12.743
THAT THEIR PROCESS COULD BE IN

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:15.112
PART STREAMLINED BY DELEGATING

00:45:15.179 --> 00:45:17.848
MORE FUNCTIONS TO THE CPUC STAFF

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.116
PARTICULARLY IF YOU DEVELOP

00:45:19.183 --> 00:45:22.719
EXPERTISE IN THE SAFETY AREA.

00:45:22.786 --> 00:45:23.754
I MEAN THAT MAKES GOOD SENSE AND

00:45:23.821 --> 00:45:24.855
AND FEW YEARS AGO WE DID GIVE

00:45:24.922 --> 00:45:26.723
THAT AUTHORITIES TO FIND SIDE

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.391
AND FIND.

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:28.659
A THORNY FOR THOSE MINOR

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:29.560
VIOLATIONS BUT I THINK THAT

00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.061
YOU'RE RIGHT WILL TAKE IT UP

00:45:31.128 --> 00:45:39.103
WITH THEM TO SEE THANK YOU.

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:45.476
THANK YOU MISTER MISS MITCHELL

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:46.477
SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'RE VERY

00:45:46.543 --> 00:45:48.245
COMPLIMENTARY TO THE CPUC I'M

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:51.215
JUST WONDERING -- IF IT'S JUST

00:45:51.281 --> 00:45:52.216
SO MONOLITHIC THAT THAT IT NEEDS

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:52.683
MORE THAN WHAT YOU'RE

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:53.517
RECOMMENDING I'M JUST WONDERING

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:54.184
IF IT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN UP INTO

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.552
SMALLER UNITS TO BE MORE

00:45:55.619 --> 00:45:55.853
EFFECTIVE.

00:45:55.919 --> 00:45:56.487
SO SO TO BE CLEAR I'M HERE AS A

00:45:56.553 --> 00:45:57.788
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STRIKE

00:45:57.855 --> 00:45:58.822
FORCE AND I HATE I DON'T MEAN TO

00:45:58.889 --> 00:45:59.890
BE COMPLEMENTARY OR OTHERWISE I

00:45:59.957 --> 00:46:02.126
WAS TRYING TO REPORT ON WHAT THE

00:46:02.192 --> 00:46:03.393
STRIKE FOR SUGGESTED.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:06.130
I THINK THAT AT THE END OF THIS

00:46:06.196 --> 00:46:07.965
PROCESS THE STRIKE FORCE REALLY

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.633
LEFT IT TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.968
THE LEGISLATURE AND AND YOU'RE

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:12.936
GOOD POLICY MAKING SKILLS TO

00:46:13.003 --> 00:46:13.737
DETERMINE WHAT WOULD BE

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:16.507
APPROPRIATE. FOR THAT SI PC.

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:18.809
WELL I'M NOT TRYING TO KILL THE

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:19.176
MESSENGER I AM.

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.345
I'M JUST TRYING.

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.713
TO MAYBE PRIDE A LITTLE BIT AND

00:46:22.779 --> 00:46:24.248
SAY HEY YOU YOU HAVE SOME

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.316
RECOMMENDATIONS BUT THE MORE I

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:27.885
LOOK AT THE CPUC IT SEEMS LIKE

00:46:27.951 --> 00:46:29.887
IT'S TRYING TO COVER SO MUCH

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:30.821
TERRITORY.

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.122
AND IT WAS SO MANY INDUSTRIES

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.057
AND IT KEEPS GROWING AND I'M

00:46:34.124 --> 00:46:35.259
JUST WONDERING IF.

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.460
YOU KNOW USUALLY USING THE WORD

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:38.729
REFORM BUT I'M I I'M WONDERING

00:46:38.795 --> 00:46:40.197
IF RESTRUCTURING AND RE.

00:46:40.264 --> 00:46:42.566
REORGANIZING AND AND SPLITTING

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.701
IT UP INTO MORE FOCUSED.

00:46:44.768 --> 00:46:46.003
DIVISIONS WOULD BE A BETTER

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:47.905
APPROACH SO I THINK THAT THE

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.773
REPORT WAS FAIRLY CLEAR ON THE

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:52.209
ISSUE THAT THE BREADTH AND SCOPE

00:46:52.276 --> 00:46:54.278
OF WHAT THE CPUC IS TRYING TO DO

00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:56.146
IS IS VERY DIFFICULT GIVEN ITS

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:56.780
CURRENT.

00:46:56.847 --> 00:46:58.048
CURRENT RESOURCES AND

00:46:58.115 --> 00:46:59.216
CONFIGURATION.

00:46:59.283 --> 00:47:01.752
HOW YOU WOULD GO ABOUT

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.754
IMPLEMENTING THAT REFORM?

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.388
I'M A BANKRUPTCY LAWYER I'M BIG

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:05.822
ON RESTRUCTURING THINGS BUT I I

00:47:05.889 --> 00:47:07.991
COULDN'T TELL YOU HOW TO DO THAT

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:09.359
PART OF IT BUT I DO THINK THAT

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:10.661
THE REPORT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT

00:47:10.727 --> 00:47:12.196
THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE

00:47:12.262 --> 00:47:13.463
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.932
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE REPORT

00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:15.132
WAS.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.201
WITH THANKS FOR YOUR POLITE AND

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:18.802
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE.

00:47:18.869 --> 00:47:19.536
THANK YOU MISTER.

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:25.275
OKAY -- MR MALIKI WANTED -- I

00:47:25.342 --> 00:47:26.777
THINK I'M I'M STARTING PART

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.011
THREE IF THAT'S OKAY SENATOR

00:47:28.078 --> 00:47:29.346
DODD AND THEN AND THEN I'LL TURN

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:32.149
IT OVER. TO TO MISTER POLLOCK

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:32.950
WHAT WHAT WHAT SECOND.

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.017
IF I MAY BEFORE WE GET TO

00:47:34.084 --> 00:47:36.119
SECTION THREE I'D LIKE IF I

00:47:36.186 --> 00:47:37.854
COULD TO TO GO BACK.

00:47:37.921 --> 00:47:39.223
TO SOME OF THE THE POINTS THE

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.591
OBSERVATIONS YOU MADE ABOUT

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.392
THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING

00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:43.227
IN THE STATE.

00:47:43.293 --> 00:47:44.695
AND AS I WAS GOING THROUGH MY

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:47.364
LIST OF LEGISLATION THAT WE DID

00:47:47.431 --> 00:47:50.067
LAST YEAR SB NINE A ONE A NUMBER

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:52.002
OF BILLS THAT I DID TO TALK

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:54.137
ABOUT THINNING -- MAKING SURE

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:57.074
THAT WE CAN DO -- THE KINDS OF

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.776
VEGETATION IN FUEL MANAGEMENT --

00:47:59.843 --> 00:48:01.445
WORKING WITH CAL FIRE THESE ARE

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.813
THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THE

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:04.548
LEGISLATURE'S PASSING ALREADY

00:48:04.615 --> 00:48:05.916
BEEN SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR.

00:48:05.983 --> 00:48:09.386
SO WELL I APPRECIATE IDENTIFYING --

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:11.788
THE PROBLEMS THAT EXIST WE HAVE

00:48:11.855 --> 00:48:13.924
I THINK TO A LARGE EXTENT

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.392
STARTED WORKING ON THOSE THINGS

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.294
THROUGH POLICY SO THEN THE

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:21.698
QUESTION BECOMES -- IS THERE

00:48:21.765 --> 00:48:23.000
GOING TO BE FUNDING.

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:23.667
IN THE BUDGET I'M NOT TRYING TO

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:24.568
YOU KNOW GET A SNEAK PREVIEW BUT

00:48:24.635 --> 00:48:26.003
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT A LOT OF

00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:27.471
THIS WORK.

00:48:27.537 --> 00:48:29.473
IS READY TO BE IMPLEMENTED WE

00:48:29.539 --> 00:48:31.208
HAVE DONE THE POLICY CAL FIRE

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:34.244
NOW AS A RESULT OF LEGISLATION

00:48:34.311 --> 00:48:35.779
FROM LAST YEAR FOR EXAMPLE HAS

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:36.780
BEEN AUTHORIZED TO WORK WITH

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.615
LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO IDENTIFY

00:48:38.682 --> 00:48:40.417
THE HARDENING -- AND THE

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.085
PLANNING THAT NEED TO BE DONE

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:43.687
FOR ALL THOSE HOMES IN THE WILL

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:45.355
WE AS YOU SAY AND AND MAKING

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:47.324
SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH EGRESS

00:48:47.391 --> 00:48:49.026
INGRESS AND Là PARADISE.

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:50.527
SO THOSE THINGS ARE BEING DONE

00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.562
AS WE SPEAK THE QUESTION IS IS

00:48:52.629 --> 00:48:54.031
THERE GOING TO BE FUNDING SO

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:57.301
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. TO TRY TO

00:48:57.367 --> 00:48:58.468
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WHICH ARE

00:48:58.535 --> 00:48:59.803
BOTH BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.039
REPORT AND ALSO ADDRESSED TO

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.740
SOME EXTENT -- THROUGH

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:05.208
LEGISLATION.

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.277
THAT WE ARE -- UNDERTOOK LAST

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:08.912
YEAR IN RESPONDING TO THESE

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:10.981
FIRES SO WHAT IS SO I GUESS

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.516
QUESTIONS WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:13.817
OF FINANCIAL COMMITMENT TO THESE

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.419
ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT IN

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:18.188
PLACE. ONE EXAMPLE FOR EXAMPLE --

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.490
AS BEFORE SIXTY FIVE I THINK IS

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:22.726
A BILL I DID LAST YEAR TO GIVE.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.061
PEOPLE MONEY TO HARDEN THEIR

00:49:24.127 --> 00:49:26.330
HOMES THROUGH THE PACE PROGRAM

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:28.565
IT'S NOT ENOUGH BUT IT'S A START

00:49:28.632 --> 00:49:30.233
ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE THINGS

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.968
TO DO YOU HAVE SOME PROPOSALS

00:49:32.035 --> 00:49:33.270
THAT YOU'LL BE PRESENTING EITHER

00:49:33.337 --> 00:49:34.304
THROUGH THE BUDGET.

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.972
OR THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US

00:49:36.039 --> 00:49:38.742
AS POLICY MAKERS -- INTRODUCED

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:42.479
TO TO EFFECTUATE THESE

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:44.247
SUGGESTIONS.

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:44.848
IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:45.449
THINK YOU RAISE A VERY GOOD

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:46.083
POINT WHICH IS THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.084
IN THE PAST TWO TO THREE YEARS

00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.052
HAS PROVIDED YOU KNOW AGENCIES A

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.420
LOT OF AUTHORITY TO MAKE

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:51.955
PROGRESS ON THESE FRONTS ONE

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:54.624
AREA -- THAT COMES TO MIND FOR

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:55.225
ME AS PRESCRIBED FRE.

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:56.560
NAM THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.562
CHALLENGE -- WE KNOW IT MAKES

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.497
SENSE TO DO TO AVOID MEGA FIRES

00:50:00.564 --> 00:50:03.567
BUT THERE ARE A RANGE OF OF OF

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.102
REGULATORY AND TURN A

00:50:05.168 --> 00:50:06.002
BUREAUCRATIC CHALLENGES WITH

00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:08.872
THAT -- AND SO LEGISLATION HAS

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:10.407
HAS CLEARED THE WAY FOR US T

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.508
MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS SO YOU

00:50:11.575 --> 00:50:12.843
KNOW ONE POINT TAKEN.

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:13.977
WE NEED TO HOLD OURSELVES

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:15.812
ACCOUNTABLE FOR MAKING PROGRESS

00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:17.214
IN IMPLEMENTING THESE LAWS I AND

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.548
THEN TO THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:19.282
SURE THAT THERE'S FUNDING FOR

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.752
THIS -- YOU REYES HOME HARDENING --

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:25.122
AND I WOULD AGREE THAT -- YOU

00:50:25.188 --> 00:50:27.891
KNOW WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO

00:50:27.958 --> 00:50:30.193
HELP PEOPLE -- HELP IN PEOPLE IN

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.361
THESE VOLATILE COMMUNITIES

00:50:31.428 --> 00:50:32.796
AFFORD HOME HARDENING -- HOME

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:36.066
HARDENING YOU KNOW IS NOT CHEAP --

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.801
THERE ARE AFFORDABLE THINGS THAT

00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.903
CAN GET DONE BUT THEY NEED

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:40.804
FINANCIAL SUPPORT.

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:42.639
YOU REYES PACE AS AN EXAMPLE AND

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.307
I THINK BASED ON THE LEGISLATIVE

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:46.243
LEADERSHIP ON PACE I WAS TOLD

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:47.811

THE THREE APPROACHES THAT THE

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:47.437
STRIKE FORCE BELIEVES MERIT

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.039
FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:50.507
THE REPORT DID NOT SELECT AN

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.042
APPROACH BUT RATHER IDENTIFIED

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:53.443
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT THE

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.678
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:51:54.744 --> 00:51:57.481
WOULD NEED TO ANSWER BEFORE

00:51:57.547 --> 00:51:58.348
SELECTING AN APPROACH.

00:51:58.415 --> 00:51:59.749
BEFORE MOVING INTO THE SUBSTANCE

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.585
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS I WANTED

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:03.253
TO IDENTIFY FOR THE COMMITTEE A

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.055
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE UNDERLYING

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.289
THE REPORT.

00:52:06.356 --> 00:52:08.225
AND THAT IS THAT STABLE WELL

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:10.460
MANAGED AND INVESTABLE UTILITIES

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.028
A BENEFIT CALIFORNIA.

00:52:12.095 --> 00:52:13.029
AND BY INVESTABLE I MEAN THEY

00:52:13.096 --> 00:52:15.065
CAN ATTRACT CAPITAL THE MARKET

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:16.700
AT REASONABLE PRICES.

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.635
RECOGNIZING THE SPECIFIC ISSUES

00:52:18.702 --> 00:52:20.036
WITH P. JEANNIE IN TERMS OF

00:52:20.103 --> 00:52:21.938
SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT THAT WILL

00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:23.106
DEAL WITH MORE IN PART FIVE OF

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:24.441
THE REPORT.

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:25.909
THE REPORT NOTES THE UTILITIES

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.911
HAVE BEEN AND REMAIN CRITICAL

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.513
PLAYERS IN ACHIEVING

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:30.947
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:32.782
AND IN MAINTAINING A SAFE AND

00:52:32.849 --> 00:52:34.184
RELIABLE SYSTEM.

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.286
MOREOVER UTILITIES THAT ARE NOT

00:52:36.353 --> 00:52:37.621
FINANCIALLY STABLE OR NOT

00:52:37.687 --> 00:52:39.890
INVESTABLE MAY HAVE REAL

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.324
FINANCIAL COSTS FOR CONSUMERS.

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:42.626
ALL THREE INVESTOR OWNED

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.461
UTILITIES A RECENTLY REQUESTED

00:52:44.528 --> 00:52:47.264
IN FOR GORE CPUC FILINGS

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:48.832
INCREASED RETURN ON EQUITY.

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:51.768
IN THE RANGERS 14216% WHICH IS

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.637
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE FROM WHERE

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:54.905
THERE ARE -- HE IS TODAY.

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:56.239
I'M AND MOST OF THEM JUSTIFIED

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:57.574
THOSE REQUESTS BASED ON

00:52:57.641 --> 00:52:59.643
SUBSTANTIAL WILD FIRE RISK

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.545
PREMIUMS.

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:02.913
NOT INVISIBLE UTILITIES ALSO

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.214
HAVE HIGHER BORROWING COSTS.

00:53:04.281 --> 00:53:06.349
ON AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

00:53:06.416 --> 00:53:08.652
THOSE INCREASES IN IN OUR WE ARE

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:09.619
IN FOR OUR APPROVED IN THE NEAR

00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:10.186
TERM.

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.755
THE RECENT FILINGS PROVIDE SOME

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.023
CONTEXT FOR YOU FOR THE

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.824
POTENTIAL COSTS TO CONSUMERS IF

00:53:14.891 --> 00:53:16.793
A NEW LIABILITY FRAMEWORK IS AND

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:19.029
PUT IN PLACE.

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.530
WITH THAT SAID THE STRIKE FORCE

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.399
CONCLUDED THAT ANY REFORM OF THE

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:24.000
WILDFIRE LIABILITY FRAMEWORK

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.635
NEEDED TO BE GROUNDED IN SEVEN

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:26.836
PRINCIPLES.

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:29.306
NUMBER ONE MAINTAINING SAFE

00:53:29.372 --> 00:53:31.207
RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE POWER.

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:33.076
NUMBER TWO HOLDING UTILITIES

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:35.845
ACCOUNTABLE TO PRIORITIZE SAFETY.

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.614
NUMBER THREE TREATING WILD FIRE

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.482
VICTIMS FAIRLY.

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.651
NUMBER FOUR REQUIRING EQUITABLE

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.453
STAKEHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:45.589
NUMBER FIVE REDUCING OVERALL

00:53:45.655 --> 00:53:48.058
COSTS OF BOTH THE FIRES IN THE

00:53:48.124 --> 00:53:49.326
CLAIMS THAT ARISE FROM THEM.

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.594
BUT BEING CAREFUL NOT TO CREATE

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:52.596
A FREE RIDER PROBLEM OR CREATING

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:54.731
AN APPROPRIATE INCENTIVES FOR

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:56.132
PEOPLE NOT TO ACT RESPONSIBLY.

00:53:56.199 --> 00:53:57.400
NUMBER SIX PROMOTING

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:59.703
CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.504
AND NUMBER SEVEN RECOGNIZING THE

00:54:01.571 --> 00:54:03.139
CONTRIBUTIONS OF TAX PAYERS THAT

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:05.175
WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE COST

00:54:05.241 --> 00:54:06.242
OF MITIGATING FIRE RISK IN

00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:08.244
FIGHTING FIRES AS AND WHEN THEY

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:09.579
IGNITE.

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:11.081
THE REPORT SPEND SUBSTANTIAL

00:54:11.147 --> 00:54:12.983
TIME ON THE EXISTING LEGAL

00:54:13.049 --> 00:54:14.384
FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO WILDFIRE

00:54:14.451 --> 00:54:15.919
LIABILITY COST RECOVERY

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:17.721
STANDARDS THE RECENT APPLICATION

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.789
OF THOSE STANDARDS SENATE BILL

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:21.191
NINE A ONE AND ITS AFTERMATH.

00:54:21.257 --> 00:54:22.258
AND THE CURRENT STATE OF THE

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.160
INSURANCE MARKET AND WHILE WE'RE

00:54:24.227 --> 00:54:25.428
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS ON THAT.

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.396
I'M NOT GONNA GO THROUGH THAT

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:28.231
BACKGROUND IN DETAIL I THINK THE

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:29.165
COMMITTEE MEMBERS PROBABLY HAVE

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.667
A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF SOME OF

00:54:30.734 --> 00:54:32.569
THOSE ISSUES THAN ANYONE SITTING

00:54:32.636 --> 00:54:36.906
UP HERE -- THE REPORT IDENTIFIED

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.542
THREE CONCEPTS AS WORTHY OF

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:40.977
FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:42.412
BY THE POLICY MAKERS.

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:44.514
THE FIRST CONCEPT WAS A

00:54:44.581 --> 00:54:49.953
LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND LIABILITY

00:54:50.020 --> 00:54:51.888
UNDER ADVERSE CONDEMNATION TO A

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:52.956
FAULT BASED STANDARD.

00:54:53.023 --> 00:54:54.224
AND THE THIRD CONCEPT WAS A

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.726
LARGER WILDFIRE OR CATASTROPHIC

00:54:56.793 --> 00:54:58.928
WELFARE FUNDS.

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:00.163
I WOULD NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.498
THAT THESE CONCEPTS ARE NOT

00:55:01.564 --> 00:55:02.799
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE OR

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:04.868
NECESSARILY STANDALONE CONCEPTS

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.336
WELL I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE

00:55:06.403 --> 00:55:08.338
CONCEPTS WANTING CONCEPTS THREE

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:09.472
IS TO SEPARATE FUNDS.

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.041
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:12.776
COULD CONSIDER COMBINING CERTAIN

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:14.277
CONCEPTS ARE IMPORTING FEATURES

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:16.112
THAT WE DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.647
FROM ONE COM SET CONCEPT TO

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:18.415
ANOTHER.

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.649
I'M ALSO BECAUSE OF THE

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:21.317
UNCERTAIN IMPACT OF ANY OF THE

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.419
ALTERNATIVES ON THE INSURANCE

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:23.553
MARKETS.

00:55:23.620 --> 00:55:25.188
THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:26.790
MAY ALSO WISH TO ABOUT EVALUATE

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:28.758
POLICY OPTIONS TO IMPROVE ACCESS

00:55:28.825 --> 00:55:30.326
AND AFFORDABILITY OF INSURANCE

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.829
DEPENDING ON WHICH OPTION YOU

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:33.329
WOULD SELECT.

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.831
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

00:55:34.898 --> 00:55:36.466
HIGHLIGHT THAT EACH OF THESE

00:55:36.533 --> 00:55:37.834
ALTERNATIVES ASSUMES A

00:55:37.901 --> 00:55:40.236
REGULATORY REFORM IN THE FURTHER

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:41.237
IN THE FORM OF FURTHER

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.839
CLARIFICATION OF COST RECOVERY

00:55:42.906 --> 00:55:43.740
STANDARDS.

00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:45.275
AND MODIFICATION OF POTENTIAL

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.609
STREAMLINING OF THE REGULATORY

00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:47.844
PROCESS.

00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:49.312
THE STRIKE FORCE CONCLUDED THAT

00:55:49.379 --> 00:55:51.648
SOME DEGREE OF REGULATORY REFORM

00:55:51.715 --> 00:55:53.516
IS NECESSARY IN ANY OF THE

00:55:53.583 --> 00:55:55.118
CONCEPTS THAT WERE PUT FORTH IN

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.086
THE REPORT.

00:55:56.152 --> 00:55:57.887
IF THE CONCEPTS ARE GOING TO

00:55:57.954 --> 00:56:00.223
STABILIZE THE UTILITIES AND PUT

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:02.092
THE UTILITIES IN A POSITION TO

00:56:02.158 --> 00:56:04.027
FINANCE THEIR CAPITAL NEEDS.

00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:05.929
AT A REASONABLE COST.

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:06.896
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT FOR

00:56:06.963 --> 00:56:08.798
POLICY MAKERS TO CONSIDER THAT

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.400
ANY CHANGE IN THE REGULATORY

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:11.501
FRAMEWORK.

00:56:11.568 --> 00:56:13.603
AND ANY INCREASED CERTAINTY ON

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.305
COST RECOVERY HAS AN ATTENDANT

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:16.773
IMPACT ON REPAIRS.

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.475
AND SO REGULATORY REFORM NEEDS

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:19.576
TO BE BALANCED IN TERMS OF

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.578
WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR INVESTABLE

00:56:21.644 --> 00:56:23.747
UTILITIES AND THE IMPACT THAT

00:56:23.813 --> 00:56:25.348
THAT REGULATORY REFORM WOULD

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.550
HAVE ON REPAIRS.

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:29.018
EACH OF THE CONCEPTS HAS

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:30.920
BENEFITS IN TRADE OFFS IN THE

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:33.556
CASE OF A FUN STRUCTURE AT LEAST

00:56:33.623 --> 00:56:35.258
ONE THAT REQUIRES CONTRIBUTIONS

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:37.127
FROM UTILITY INVESTORS. ONE OF

00:56:37.193 --> 00:56:38.528
THOSE CHALLENGES IS THAT THE

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:41.297
INVESTOR CONTRIBUTION IS LIKELY

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:42.031
TO COME WITH CONDITIONS.

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:43.900
ARE TYPICALLY OR EXPECTEDLY

00:56:43.967 --> 00:56:45.802
REQUIRING MORE DEFINITIVE AND

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.437
POTENTIALLY UNCAPPED COST

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.072
RECOVERY STANDARDS THAT COULD

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.741
SHIFT FUTURE COSTS TO REPAIRS.

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.209
AND OR LEAVE FEWER FUNDS

00:56:53.276 --> 00:56:54.577
AVAILABLE TO PAY WILD FIRE

00:56:54.644 --> 00:56:55.912
DAMAGE CLAIMS.

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.280
SO WITH THAT LET ME BRIEFLY

00:56:57.347 --> 00:56:58.715
SUMMARIZE THE THREE CONCEPTS

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.416
THAT WERE IN THE REPORT.

00:57:00.483 --> 00:57:02.051
THE LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND IS

00:57:02.118 --> 00:57:03.987
DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE INVEST

00:57:04.053 --> 00:57:05.321
ABILITY OF UTILITIES BY

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.689
PROVIDING ESSENTIALLY BRIDGE

00:57:06.756 --> 00:57:07.991
FINANCING OUR LIQUIDITY

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.293
FINANCING. FOR UTILITIES TO PAY

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:12.262
WILD FIRE CLAIMS PENDING THE C.

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.130
P. UC'S DECISION ON COST

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:15.331
RECOVERY.

00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:16.599
THE IDEA IS TO ADDRESS THE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.468
TIMING PROCESS THAT EXIST IN THE

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.303
EXIT IN THE CURRENT REGULATORY

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:21.771
FRAMEWORK.

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.006
THE PRIMARY BENEFIT OF THE

00:57:23.072 --> 00:57:24.607
LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND IS TO

00:57:24.674 --> 00:57:25.875
STABILIZE THE CREDIT RATINGS OF

00:57:25.942 --> 00:57:27.544
UTILITIES AND ALLOW THEM TO

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:29.412
ACCESS CAPITAL TO MAKE THE

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.514
NECESSARY INVESTMENTS.

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:33.283
THAT BENEFITS REPAIRS BY KEEPING

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.918
THE COST OF BORROWING AND R. O.

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.452
E. RELATIVELY LOW.

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:37.921
SOME FEATURES OF THE LIQUIDITY

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:39.155
FUND THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.824
REPORT.

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.358
THE REPORT IDENTIFIED THAT

00:57:42.425 --> 00:57:44.060
FUNDING COULD BE PROVIDED BY A

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.362
UTILITY INVESTORS OR RATE PAYERS

00:57:46.429 --> 00:57:49.098
OR COMBINATION. ONE SOURCE OF

00:57:49.165 --> 00:57:50.633
POTENTIAL FUNDING THAT THE

00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:52.302
REPORT CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:54.304
CONTINUATION OR SECURITIZATION

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:56.005
OF THE STREAM OF REVENUE THAT'S

00:57:56.072 --> 00:57:57.340
CURRENTLY KNOWN AS THE

00:57:57.407 --> 00:57:58.441
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

00:57:58.508 --> 00:57:59.876
ARE D. W. R. CHARGE.

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.578
ONCE THOSE BONDS ARE TO FEES

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:02.912
THAT CHARGE COULD IN THEORY

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:04.581
CONTINUE AND BE USED FOR THIS

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.682
PURPOSE.

00:58:05.748 --> 00:58:07.250
THE FUND WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.885
PAY CLAIMS BEFORE COST RECOVERY

00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:10.620
DETERMINATION THIS GOES TO THE

00:58:10.687 --> 00:58:13.089
ISSUE OF CREATING LIQUIDITY BY

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.892
pONCE THAT COST RECOVERY

00:58:15.959 --> 00:58:18.027
DETERMINATION WAS MADE THEN THE

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.196
FUND WOULD BE REIMBURSED IF THE

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:22.498
COST RECOVERY DETERMINATION WAS

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:24.434
THAT UTILITY HAD ACTED PRUDENTLY.

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:26.135
THAN THAT REIMBURSEMENT WILL

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.537
COME FROM REPAIRS.

00:58:27.604 --> 00:58:28.738
IF THE UTILITY HAD NOT ACTED

00:58:28.805 --> 00:58:30.006
PRUDENTLY THEN IT WOULD COME

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:32.075
FROM UTILITY INVESTORS IN BOTH

00:58:32.141 --> 00:58:33.476
CASES WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THE

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:34.978
FUND WOULD GET MONEY BACK IN SO

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.479
IT WOULD JUST HAVE PROVIDE IT

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.113
WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED THE TIMING

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:37.780
ISSUE.

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:39.082
BECAUSE THE DRAWS WOULD BE

00:58:39.148 --> 00:58:40.917
REIMBURSED AND THE SIZE OF THE

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.819
FUND THAN IS LIKELY TO BE MORE

00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:44.187
LIMITED IT'S LESS LIKELY TO BE

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:45.088
DEPLETED.

00:58:45.154 --> 00:58:48.291
BECAUSE YOU HAVE A REVOLVING

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:48.892
SOURCES OF FUNDING.

00:58:48.958 --> 00:58:49.993
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:52.095
THIS CONCEPT DOES NOT SHIELD

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:53.696
EITHER UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS OR

00:58:53.763 --> 00:58:55.665
LIQUID OR UTILITY CUSTOMERS FROM

00:58:55.732 --> 00:58:57.233
ON CAP LIABILITY FOR WILD FIRE

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.501
DAMAGES IT ADDRESSES THE TIMING

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.670
RISK.

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.472
THE SECOND CONCEPT IDENTIFIED IN

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:03.907
THE REPORT WOULD INVOLVE

00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:05.942
CHANGING STRICTLY ABILITY TO A

00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:07.343
FAULT BASED STANDARD.

00:59:07.410 --> 00:59:08.778
APPLICATION OF A FAULT BASED

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.580
STANDARD IS INTENDED TO BALANCE

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.348
THE NEED FOR PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:13.750
IN THIS CASE AN ELECTRIC

00:59:13.816 --> 00:59:14.851
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:15.952
WITH THE PRIVATE HARM TO

00:59:16.019 --> 00:59:17.487
INDIVIDUALS A CAGE OCCASION BY

00:59:17.553 --> 00:59:19.322
THOSE IMPROVEMENTS.

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:20.823
THIS CHANGE WOULD IMPACT ONLY

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:22.492
CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGES

00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:23.760
SENSE CALIFORNIA GENERALLY

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.094
ALREADY APPLIES A NEGLIGENCE

00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:27.563
STANDARD TO PERSONAL INJURY

00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:28.164
WRONGFUL DEATH AND OTHER TORT

00:59:28.231 --> 00:59:29.933
CLAIMS.

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:31.467
MOVING TO FALL BASE STANDARD HAS

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:32.969
THE IMPACT OF SHIFTING THE RISK

00:59:33.036 --> 00:59:34.570
OF PROPERTY LOSS TO INSURANCE

00:59:34.637 --> 00:59:35.638
COMPANIES.

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.240
AN UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED

00:59:37.307 --> 00:59:38.474
PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE CASE

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.176
WHERE THE UTILITY IS NOT A BAD

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:41.377
ACTOR.

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:42.712
IF YOU TELL THE IS AT FAULT

00:59:42.779 --> 00:59:44.714
INCLUDING FOR NEGLIGENT RECKLESS

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.616
OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT THAN

00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:47.517
UTILITY WOULD STILL BE

00:59:47.583 --> 00:59:49.285
RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THE

00:59:49.352 --> 00:59:50.320
DAMAGES INCLUDING PUNITIVE

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.822
DAMAGES.

00:59:52.889 --> 00:59:54.390
THE THIRD CONCEPT IDENTIFIED IN

00:59:54.457 --> 00:59:55.858
THE REPORT IS WHAT WE DESCRIBE

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.961
AS A WILDFIRE FUND WHICH IS A

00:59:58.027 --> 01:00:00.063
WELL CAPITALIZED FUND THAT WOULD

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.431
CREATE A BUFFER TO ABSORB A

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.333
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.934
WILDFIRE LIABILITY COSTS.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.202
THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE PASSED

01:00:06.269 --> 01:00:08.671
ON TO REPAIRS UNDER EXISTING LAW

01:00:08.738 --> 01:00:09.839
WHAT PROVIDING TIME FOR

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.040
MITIGATION EFFORTS TO BE

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:11.708
ADVANCED.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.242
THE THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.510
BETWEEN THIS FUND AND THE

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.045
LIQUIDITY ONLY FUND.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.747
IS AT THE WILD FIRE FUND BOTH

01:00:17.814 --> 01:00:19.649
ADDRESSES LIQUIDITY ISSUES AND

01:00:19.716 --> 01:00:21.551
ALSO IT TENDS TO LIMIT THE COST

01:00:21.617 --> 01:00:23.019
TO REPAIR IS BY BUILDING UP A

01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:24.654
LIABILITY TOWER.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.357
THAT THAT GOES FIRST TO FUNDS

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:28.891
THAT ARE PROVIDED BY UTILITIES.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.560
THE REPAIR SAVINGS ARISE BECAUSE

01:00:30.626 --> 01:00:31.928
THE UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:33.763
CONTRIBUTING NON RECOVERABLE

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.366
DEPOSIT TO THE FUND WHICH WOULD

01:00:36.432 --> 01:00:38.234
PAY CLAIMS FOR COST RECOVERY.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.369
OR WOULD PAY CLAIMS WHICH COST

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.470
RECOVERY WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:41.738
AVAILABLE TO LARGE THE

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.239
SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTION.

01:00:43.306 --> 01:00:44.507
THE GREATER THE REPAIR SAVINGS

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.575
ARE THE BUFFER BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:48.878
SOURCE OF FUNDS TO PAY THOSE

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:50.346
BEFORE YOU GO TO REPAIRS.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:51.647
LIKE A LIQUIDITY FUND THE

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.448
WILDFIRE FUND PROVIDES A SOURCE

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:53.716
OF IMMEDIATE FUNDING FOR CLAIMS

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:54.851
ASSERTED AGAINST THE UTILITIES

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:56.486
AND FOR CATASTROPHIC WILD FIRE

01:00:56.552 --> 01:00:57.954
DAMAGES.

01:00:58.021 --> 01:00:59.789
SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE WILD

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:01.424
FIRE FUND CONSIDERED IN THE

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:02.525
REPORT IN YOUR ARE HIGHLIGHTED

01:01:02.592 --> 01:01:03.960
IN THE REPORT.

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:04.961
INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.

01:01:05.028 --> 01:01:06.529
UTILITY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:07.730
REQUIRED TO MAKE A SUBSTANTIAL

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.265
CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUNDS CLAIMS

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.833
PAYING RESOURCES.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:12.735
IN ADDITION THE FUNDS CLAIMS

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:13.269
PAYING RESOURCES COULD BE

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.971
ENHANCED TO SOMETHING LIKE THE

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:17.507
EXTENSION OF THE D. W. ARE

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.074
CHARGED THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:01:18.141 --> 01:01:19.375
BEFORE.

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:20.610
INSURERS WOULD ACCEPT THE CAP ON

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.412
SUBROGATION CLAIMS IN ORDER TO

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.113
LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CLAIMS

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.081
AGAINST THE FUND.

01:01:25.148 --> 01:01:26.849
THE CPUC WOULD BE ABLE TO RETAIN

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.352
JURISDICTION TO IMPOSE PENALTIES

01:01:29.419 --> 01:01:31.454
ON UTILITIES THAT DO NOT ACT

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.056
PRUDENTLY BUT IN THE REPORT

01:01:33.122 --> 01:01:35.291
BEYOND THE CBC PENALIZING THEM

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.260
THE FUND WAS LARGELY A NO FAULT.

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.328
FUND.

01:01:39.395 --> 01:01:40.863
ON THE FUND COULD PULL CAPITALS

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.998
FROM ALL I USE.

01:01:42.065 --> 01:01:43.433
MUNICIPAL UTILITIES COULD

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:45.201
PARTICIPATE AT THEIR OPTION.

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:46.369
THE FUND COULD BE LIMITED TO

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:48.771
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES HOWEVER

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:49.238
YOU DEFINE DID IN THE

01:01:49.305 --> 01:01:50.606
LEGISLATION.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:52.041
AND THE FUND COULD IF DESIRED

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.743
USE A TRUST FOR ADMINISTRATION

01:01:53.810 --> 01:01:55.144
OF CLAIMS TO SPEED UP RECOVERY

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.245
NOT AS I INDICATED AT THE

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.747
BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS SOME OF

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:58.481
THOSE.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.582
FEATURES COULD BE IMPORTED

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:01.684
ANOTHER FUND STRUCTURES BUT

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:02.385
THOSE WERE THE THINGS THAT OR OR

01:02:02.452 --> 01:02:03.786
DROPPED ALTOGETHER BUT BUT THOSE

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:05.321
ARE THE THINGS THAT WE

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.323
IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:08.524
THIS CONCEPT ALSO DOES NOT

01:02:08.591 --> 01:02:10.359
SHIELD UTILITY CUSTOMERS FROM ON

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:11.794
CAP MY ABILITY FOR WILD FIRE

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:13.596
DAMAGES IT JUST CREATES A BUFFER

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:15.098
LAYER THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT

01:02:15.164 --> 01:02:17.233
BECAUSE THE UTILITIES PROVIDED

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.969
CONTRIBUTION UP FRONT -- AND

01:02:20.036 --> 01:02:20.536
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PLACES

01:02:20.603 --> 01:02:21.337
WHERE.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:23.239
ONCE THE FUND IS EXHAUSTED IF

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.907
THE UTILITY CONTRIBUTION COMES

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:26.109
WITH THE CHANGING COST RECOVERY

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:28.344
STANDARDS THEN IT MAY BE THAT

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:30.079
REPAIRS ACTUALLY PAY MORE ONCE

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.281
THE FUND IS EXHAUSTED SO THE

01:02:32.348 --> 01:02:33.116
SIZE OF THE FUND BECOMES

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:35.485
IMPORTANT -- ALSO TO THE EXTENT

01:02:35.551 --> 01:02:36.752
THAT.

01:02:36.819 --> 01:02:38.387
THERE REALLY ISN'T THE WILDFIRE

01:02:38.454 --> 01:02:40.056
DAMAGE THAT YOU EXPECT AND YOU

01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:42.158
RAISE THE FUNDSAND THEN.

01:02:42.225 --> 01:02:43.292
REPAIRS MAY HAVE PAID FOR

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:45.328
SOMETHING THEY DON'T NEED -- THE

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.996
REPORT IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:48.831
QUESTIONS FOR EVALUATION BY THE

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:50.900
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:51.467
THE IN.

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:53.302
IN ACCORDANCE WITH EACH OF THESE

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:53.903
OPTIONS.

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:54.704
I'M NOT GONNA BE THE MALL

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.739
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF PAGES BUT

01:02:56.806 --> 01:02:58.141
IN THE FUND'S STRUCTURE THERE

01:02:58.207 --> 01:02:58.975
WERE SOME CRITICAL ONES THAT I

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:00.877
THINK POLICYMAKERS REALLY NEED

01:03:00.943 --> 01:03:03.179
TO CONSIDER I DEVELOPING A FUND

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:04.614
ONE OF THEM AND IT'S WHAT MR

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.314
BOLICK WILL SPEAK TO IN A MINUTE.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:06.649
IS HOW BIG DOES THE FUND HAVE TO

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:09.252
BE IN ORDER TO MEET ITS STATED

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:10.820
GOAL.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:11.487
GENERALLY IN MY REMARKS

01:03:11.554 --> 01:03:12.889
LIQUIDITY FUND IS SMALLER THAN A

01:03:12.955 --> 01:03:13.556
CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE FUND I'M A

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:14.924
LAWYER THAT'S ABOUT AS GOOD AS I

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:15.892
DO WITH NUMBERS.

01:03:15.958 --> 01:03:17.693
BUT IT IS IT IS AN IMPORTANT

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.328
THING IN FUND DESIGNED TO THINK

01:03:19.395 --> 01:03:20.563
ABOUT HOW BIG IT IS.

01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:22.031
WHAT IN WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.366
REPAIRS IN EACH OF THESE

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.168
ALTERNATIVES UNDER VARIOUS

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.602
ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE THE IMPACT

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:29.672
ON REPAIRS DEPENDS NOT ONLY ON?

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.674
THE SIZE OF THE FUND HOW MUCH

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.643
THE UTILITY FUNDING IS BUT ALSO

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.577
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK.

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:36.345
THE MITIGATION EFFORTS ARE GOING

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.847
TO WORK AND HOW MUCH ANNUAL WILD

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:39.448
FIRE DAMAGES ARE GOING TO BE AN

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.250
AND HOW LONG IT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.585
FOR THOSE MITIGATION EFFORTS TO

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:42.919
WORK.

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:43.619
SO ALL THOSE THINGS ARE

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.521
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.223
WHEN YOU DEVELOP YOUR FUND

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.325
DESIGN -- WELL THE FUND SATISFY

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:50.593
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CAPITAL

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.595
MARKETS TO STABILIZE RATINGS AND

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.263
HELP WITH THE PERCEPTION OF

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.731
UTILITIES CREDIT QUALITY.

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.200
IF THE FOR IF THE RATING

01:03:57.266 --> 01:03:58.935
AGENCIES AND THE INVESTORS DON'T

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.237
BELIEVE THIS IS A SUSTAINABLE

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.271
SOLUTION THAN.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:03.573
WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE PROBLEM

01:04:03.639 --> 01:04:05.107
WHAT SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTION

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.642
WOULD YOU REQUIRE TO CAPITALIZE

01:04:06.709 --> 01:04:08.044
THE FUND.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:09.378
HOW DO YOU DESIGN A FUND TO

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:11.447
CREATE THE PROPER INCENTIVES FOR

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.882
UTILITIES TO INVEST IN?

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:14.817
SAFETY AND PREVENTION MEASURES

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.786
NOT CREATE A FREE RIDER OR A

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.554
MORAL HAZARD PROBLEM.

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.256
HOW IS P. JEANNIE GOING TO RAISE

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.691
THE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO MAKE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:23.859
ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE FUND TO

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:24.927
GIVEN THAT IT'S IN BANKRUPTCY?

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:26.896
AND THE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.898
ANY FUND ACTUALLY TIED TO P.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.499
JEANNIE EXITING FROM BANKRUPTCY

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:31.701
BECAUSE THAT HAS A TIMING ISSUE

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:33.569
ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO THOSE ARE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.937
SOME CRITICAL ISSUES.

01:04:35.004 --> 01:04:36.672
THAT THE STRIKE FORCE IDENTIFIED

01:04:36.739 --> 01:04:37.540
AND THERE HAS BEEN SOME

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:38.941
CONTINUING WORK DONE ON SOME OF

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:39.909
THOSE.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.410
THERE WAS ALSO FURTHER RESEARCH

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.212
OBVIOUSLY ON A CHAIR ON

01:04:43.279 --> 01:04:45.781
ALTERNATIE TO YOU WHICH IS A

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:46.315
THE CHANGE TO A FULL BASED

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:46.949
SYSTEM.

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:48.217
SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE CRITICAL

01:04:48.284 --> 01:04:49.952
QUESTIONS IS HOW MUCH WOULD

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.354
MOVING TO A FAULT BASED SYSTEM

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.256
ACTUALLY REDUCE THE SETTLEMENTS

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:54.624
THAT UTILITIES WOULD.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.826
PAY FOR WILD FIRE CLAIMS -- AND

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:58.194
THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WE

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.729
IDENTIFIED IS WITH THIS APPROACH

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.330
TO YIELD THE CERTAINTY NEEDED

01:05:01.397 --> 01:05:02.565
FOR THE CAPITAL MARKETS

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.133
PARTICULARLY GIVEN POTENTIAL

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.102
LEGAL RISKS AND CHALLENGES THAT

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.570
I THINK YOU ALL ARE VERY AWARE

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.639
OF WITH REGARD TO CHANGE TO A

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:10.840
FAULT BASED SYSTEM.

01:05:10.906 --> 01:05:12.208
SO WITH THAT THAT THOSE ARE MY

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:12.842
REMARKS ON PART THREE I THINK

01:05:12.908 --> 01:05:13.776
MISTER POLLOCK IS GOING TO

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.211
PROVIDE YOU SOME OF THE

01:05:15.278 --> 01:05:16.612
ADDITIONAL WORK AND THAT THE

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.780
STRIKE FORCE HAS DONE.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.515
JUST IN PROVIDING SOME METRICS

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.784
RELATED TO HOW ONE MIGHT SIZE A

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.419
FUND.

01:05:23.486 --> 01:05:25.655
THANK YOU NANCY.

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.523
NOT THANK YOU SENATOR DODD FOR

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.525
THE INVITATION TO ADDRESS THE

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.494
COMMITTEE THIS AFTERNOON.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.029
MY NAME IS NATHAN POLLOCK ALSO

01:05:33.095 --> 01:05:35.131
FROM PHIL SINGER ENERGY PARTNERS

01:05:35.197 --> 01:05:37.366
WHICH I WILL REFER TO PATIENTLY

01:05:37.433 --> 01:05:38.434
AS FTP.

01:05:38.501 --> 01:05:40.403
AND I'M ALSO HERE REPRESENTING

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.204
THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE.

01:05:42.271 --> 01:05:43.906
TODAY I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:05:43.973 --> 01:05:46.208
THIRD CONCEPT AS DESCRIBED BY MS

01:05:46.275 --> 01:05:48.611
MITCHELL THAT OF AN OPTION OF A

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:50.746
WILDFIRE FUND.

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:52.348
IS MISS MITCHELL MENTIONED ONE

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:55.351
OF THE KEY OPEN QUESTIONS -- IN

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:56.652
THE REPORT RELATES TO FUND

01:05:56.719 --> 01:06:00.189
SIZING. TWO KEY DRIVERS OF FUN

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:02.825
SIZING OR THE FUTURE RISK

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:05.661
PROFILE OF WILDFIRE DAMAGE AS

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.830
WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT

01:06:07.897 --> 01:06:10.199
WILL TAKE FOR MITIGATION EFFORTS

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.934
TO TAKE EFFECT.

01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.202
THE STRIKE FORCE HAS BEGUN

01:06:13.269 --> 01:06:15.371
ANALYZING THIS QUESTION OF A

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:17.406
WILDFIRE FUNDS CLAIMS PAY

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.709
CAPACITY -- OVER TIME AND UNDER

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:21.977
CERTAIN SCENARIOS.

01:06:22.044 --> 01:06:23.179
THE FOCUS OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:06:23.245 --> 01:06:25.214
ANALYSIS [inaudible]

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:27.183
IS.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:29.652
NOT ON SPECIFIC FUND STRUCTURES

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.821
BUT RATHER ON THE EXPECTED

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.956
DURABILITY OF A FIRE AND AND ITS

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.258
CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY --

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:39.929
RELATIVE TO CAPITALIZATION.

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:41.097
IN ESSENCE THIS ANALYSIS IS

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.332
DESIGNED TO PROVIDE AN ESTIMATED

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.867
LIKELIHOOD THAT A FUND WILL

01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:47.603
RETAIN CLAIMS PAYING CAPACITY AT

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.839
CERTAIN POINTS IN THE FUTURE.

01:06:49.905 --> 01:06:51.240
BEFORE SHARING THE RESULTS OF

01:06:51.307 --> 01:06:53.309
THIS INITIAL DURABILITY ANALYSIS

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:54.143
HOWEVER.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:56.045
ALL ADDRESS THE AFOREMENTIONED

01:06:56.112 --> 01:06:58.914
DRIVERS BEGINNING WITH THE LEVEL

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.783
OF POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DAMAGES

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.651
ASSOCIATED WITH UTILITY COST

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.087
WILDFIRE.

01:07:05.154 --> 01:07:06.789
THIS REALLY TURNS ON HOW YOU

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.325
VIEW THE STATE'S RISK OF FUTURE

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:11.761
FIRE DAMAGE.

01:07:11.827 --> 01:07:13.562
THE V. P. HAS MODELED A NUMBER

01:07:13.629 --> 01:07:15.531
OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS FOR THE

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.766
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE.

01:07:16.832 --> 01:07:18.601
AND AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.137
DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE

01:07:21.203 --> 01:07:24.306
SLIDE TITLED MODELED WILD FIRE

01:07:24.373 --> 01:07:26.575
FIND DAMAGE SCENARIOS -- WHICH

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:27.977
SHOWS TO THESE RISKS SCENARIOS

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:28.611
THAT'S ALSO ON THE SCREEN BEHIND

01:07:28.677 --> 01:07:30.279
ME.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:31.881
ON ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM IF

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:33.916
THE LAST TWO YEARS WERE OUT

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.551
LIARS.

01:07:35.618 --> 01:07:37.286
A LONGER TERM HISTORICAL

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.922
ASSESSMENT OF WILD FIRE DAMAGE

01:07:39.989 --> 01:07:41.757
INDICATES MANY YEARS OF MINIMAL

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:45.561
DAMAGE WITH A FEW LARGE EVENTS.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:47.863
BASED ON THIS VIEW CALIFORNIA

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:49.665
WOULD NEED NO FUND OR PERHAPS A

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.201
SMALL FUND TO COVER THE

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.035
OCCASIONAL LARGE FIRE

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:53.335
[inaudible]

01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:55.371
HOWEVER.

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:56.071
AS YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:58.441
CROWFOOT THE DESTRUCTIVENESS OF

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.242
CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES HAS

01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:01.577
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:02.912
PARTICULARLY IN THE PAST TWO

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:04.747
YEARS.

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:07.283
AS A RESULT HISTORICAL FIRE

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:08.784
DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS MAY

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:11.787
UNDERSTATE THAT RISK.

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:13.489
ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM.

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:15.324
IF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE LOOKS

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:18.294
LIKE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY

01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:20.362
EIGHTEEN EVERY YEAR.

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.465
A WILDFIRE FUND ALONE IS ALSO

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:27.603
LIKELY NOT A WORKABLE SOLUTION.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:28.871
WHERE AND HOW POLICYMAKERS

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:31.140
ULTIMATELY VIEW CALIFORNIA'S

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.108
FUTURE FIRE RISK ON THAT

01:08:33.175 --> 01:08:34.310
SPECTRUM?

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:36.245
WILL IMPART DRIVE HOW LARGE A

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:39.648
FINE NEEDS TO BE.

01:08:39.715 --> 01:08:40.983
GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.586
SURROUNDING FUTURE WILDFIRE RISK

01:08:43.652 --> 01:08:44.753
THE STRIKE FORCED HIS ASKED IF

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:46.822
HE P. TO DEVELOP A MODEL TO

01:08:46.889 --> 01:08:49.191
PROVIDE YOU ONE DATA POINT ALONG

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:51.327
THE SPECTRUM. ONE THAT ASSUMES

01:08:51.393 --> 01:08:53.295
THE NEXT TEN YEARS LOOK MORE

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.531
LIKE THE LAST.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:56.765
FIVE AND TO ANALYZE THE

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.801
RESILIENCY OF FIND THE SIZING

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:02.638
SCENARIOS UNDER THIS PARADIGM.

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.740
THIS IS AGAIN ONE DATA POINT AND

01:09:04.807 --> 01:09:06.308
WE DOES CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.377
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:09.478
MODEL AND ANALYZE OTHER

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.181
SCENARIOS.

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:15.217
A SECOND DRIVER OF FUN SIZE IS

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:17.987
HOW LONG -- POLICY MAKERS

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.356
BELIEVE THE FINE NEEDS TO LAST.

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:21.891
BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH WILD

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:25.127
FIRE AND SAFETY EXPERTS THE

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.396
STRIKE FOR STATUS FTP TO MODEL

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:29.765
THE DURABILITY OF A FUND OVER AN

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.100
EIGHT TO TWELVE YEAR PERIOD.

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:32.001
WHICH IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.436
THESE EXPERTS HAVE INDICATED

01:09:34.503 --> 01:09:35.938
MIGHT BE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE --

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:40.609
MATERIAL MITIGATION A FAX.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.778
VARIOUS SOURCES INDICATE THAT

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.649
THE LAST FIVE YEARS OF AVERAGE

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:49.285
AGGREGATE ECONOMIC DAMAGES --

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.353
RELATED TO WILDFIRES RANGE

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:53.722
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVEN AND TEN

01:09:53.789 --> 01:09:56.458
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.327
BASED ON THAT.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.863
FEP DEVELOPED A DAMAGE RISK

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:03.666
CURVE THAT REFLECTS A RISK OF

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.734
AVERAGE ANNUAL LOSS OF EIGHT A

01:10:05.801 --> 01:10:07.002
HALF BILLION DOLLARS.

01:10:07.069 --> 01:10:10.139
WITH A HIGHER PROBABILITY THAT

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:11.640
IS TO SAY HIGHER FREQUENCY.

01:10:11.707 --> 01:10:13.842
OF FIVE BILLION TO FIFTEEN

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:16.045
BILLION DOLLAR LOSS YEARS.

01:10:16.111 --> 01:10:19.815
THAN A LONGER TERM -- HISTORICAL

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:23.085
DATA MIGHT INDICATE. FOR THE

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:24.887
PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS THE

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.488
STRIKE FORCE ALSO ASKED THAT THE

01:10:26.555 --> 01:10:28.757
P. TO INCORPORATE A BLENDED

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:31.293
SETTLEMENT RATE OF 50%.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.995
ON DAMAGE CLAIMS ACROSS BOTH

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.966
INSURED AND UNINSURED LOSSES.

01:10:37.032 --> 01:10:38.334
SO THIS TIME I LIKE TO DIRECT

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.435
YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SECOND

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:42.638
SLIDE -- TITLE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:14.890
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:15.858
OUT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT

01:13:15.924 --> 01:13:17.359
OF HYPERBOLE -- IN THE

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.361
MARKETPLACE AND WANTING TO MAKE

THANK YOU FOR MOVING ON THEM.

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.006
AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE IS

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.976
STILL THIRTY ONE CALIFORNIANS IN

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:35.144
SHORT OF OUR PEAK.

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.979
NUMBER ON THE ROAD WHICH IS BACK

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.981
IN.

01:13:39.047 --> 01:13:41.116
NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SO -- I

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:42.417
KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:13:42.484 --> 01:13:44.753
FACTORS OF ONE NEED A HIGHER UP

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.155
TO BE TO GET THE ENGINE CREWS TO

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:48.323
TO BE A GOOD ENGINES -- THROUGH

01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:49.825
THE MANUFACTURER BY.

01:13:49.892 --> 01:13:51.827
WANTING TO BE A TO SEE WHAT THIS

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:52.461
LOOKS LIKE OVER THE YEARS AND I

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:55.430
THINK -- YOU POINTED OUT THE

01:13:55.497 --> 01:13:57.566
NUMBERS SEVERITY.

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.134
OF THE DESTRUCTION THE SIZE AND

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.503
SCOPE -- WE NEED TO BE A TO GET

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:02.104
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE IN THE

01:14:02.171 --> 01:14:03.639
SEVENTIES WHERE THE BURN RATE

01:14:03.705 --> 01:14:05.507
WAS NOT EVEN.

01:14:05.574 --> 01:14:06.241
A BLIP TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:06.642
TODAY.

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.609
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT BECAUSE I

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:09.411
THINK THE THIRTEEN IS SIMPLY NOT

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:10.345
ENOUGH.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:12.214
WELL I TAKE YOUR POINT FIRST OF

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:12.848

GOVERNOR -- AND OUR TEAM I IN

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:16.718
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- I WILL

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.453
NOTE THAT UNDER THE CAL FIRE

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.589
STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WAS ISSUED

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.090
THIS YEAR EITHER UNDERTAKING A

01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:24.126
DETAILED ANALYSIS OF JUST WHAT

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:26.862
THE NEEDS ARE TO REALLY RIGHT

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.396
SIZE BOTH THE PERSONAL AND

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.932
EQUIPMENT -- AND SO WE HOPE THAT

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.967
WE WILL HAVE INFORMATION THAT

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:33.302
WILL GIVE US.

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:35.204
A BETTER SENSE OF REALLY WHERE

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.305
WE CAN AUGMENT AND HOW WE CAN

01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:39.374
AUGMENT -- BUT OVERALL YOUR I

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:41.176
TAKE YOUR POINT AND AN AGREE

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:42.845
WITH THE FACTUAL BASIS WHICH IS

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:44.446
WE HAVE LESS FIRE ENGINES THAN

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.249
WE DID -- YOU KNOW FORTY YEARS

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:49.184
AGO AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE.

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:51.053
IN IN AGAIN IN CONVERSATIONS

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:53.021
WITH CAL FIRE AT THE GOOD BUT

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:55.524
JUST HAVE CHAIRS -- COMMITTEE.

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:56.959
THERE ARE FACTORS THAT GO INTO

01:14:57.025 --> 01:14:58.927
ORDERING RIGHT WE HAVE TO BE IT

01:14:58.994 --> 01:15:00.762
TAKES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:02.664
ABOUT A YEAR PER ENGINE FROM.

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:03.332
WATER GOES INTO ACTUALLY COMING

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:05.534
OUT AND WE ALSO HAVE TO STEP BY

01:15:05.601 --> 01:15:06.802
STEP UP TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.838
IN AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH -- WE

01:15:09.905 --> 01:15:11.440
GOT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE FOCUS

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:14.877
ON RESPONSE AND HAVING.

01:15:14.943 --> 01:15:16.445
FEWER ENGINES ON THE ROAD TODAY

01:15:16.511 --> 01:15:17.913
THAN WE DID NINETEEN SEVEN FIVE

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.314
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:20.249
YEAH I'LL JUST ADD THAT AN IMAGE

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:21.183
AND SURE YOU WOULD AGREE THAT

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.217
THAT YOU KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN

01:15:22.284 --> 01:15:23.352
OUT THERE FIGHTING THE FIRES

01:15:23.418 --> 01:15:25.954
NEED YOU KNOW ADEQUATE SUPPORT

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:27.155
AND THEY NEED THE PERSONAL OUT

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:27.389
THERE.

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:28.724
YAH -- TO BOTH FIGHT THE FIRE

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:30.158
AND FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY AND SO

01:15:30.225 --> 01:15:31.627
WE'RE TAKING THIS ANALYSIS BY

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.128
CAL FIRE AS IT RELATES TO RIGHT

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.030
SIZING THE FORCE VERY -- VERY

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:38.200
SERIOUSLY FOR THE OTHER ISSUE IS

01:15:38.267 --> 01:15:40.235
THAT -- IN GREATLY APPRECIATE IN

01:15:40.302 --> 01:15:44.006
REGARDS TO FINDING --

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.307
LEGISLATURE DANCE FUNNY LASHER

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:45.941
TWENTY FIVE KNOWN FROM GOVERNOR

01:15:46.008 --> 01:15:47.309
BROWN TWENTY FIVE MILLION FROM

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:47.943
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:49.945
IN REGARD TO PRE POSITIONING --

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.347
IN WE'RE WE'RE JUST STARTING TO

01:15:52.414 --> 01:15:52.981
BE ABLE TO GET INTO THE SWING OF

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:54.950
PRE POSITIONING. ONE OF THE

01:15:55.017 --> 01:15:56.885
ITEMS THAT WOULD IF IF WE'RE NOT

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:57.452
GOING TO USE PRE POSITIONING

01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.088
DOLLARS. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.189
HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED OF

01:16:01.256 --> 01:16:03.025
WEAKNESSES IS HAVING

01:16:03.091 --> 01:16:05.093
TRANSPONDERS ON LOCAL FIRE

01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.095
ENGINE SO AT ANY ONE TIME WE

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:07.696
KNOW WE'RE LOCAL FIRE ENGINES

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:10.766
ARE AT WHEN THEY'RE DOING.

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:13.001
ADVANCING WITH MUTUAL AID.

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:13.602
SO THE STATE IS FINDING

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:16.071
TRANSPONDERS ARE LOCATORS FOR

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.607
CALIFORNIANS THE OR NOT FUNDING

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:21.276
FOR LOCAL. 85% OF OUR MUTUAL AID

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.645
IS COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:16:23.712 --> 01:16:26.081
AND TO ENSURE THAT THE MUTUAL

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:26.949
AID SYSTEM.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:28.717
IS IN COORDINATION WE'RE GONNA

01:16:28.784 --> 01:16:31.119
NEED THOSE SAME TYPE OF LOCATORS

01:16:31.186 --> 01:16:33.822
UP FOR LOCAL FIRE AS WE DO WITH

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.157
CAL FIRE SO THAT EVERYONE'S ON

01:16:35.223 --> 01:16:36.792
THE SAME SYSTEM.

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:39.561
I SAY THAT -- I THINK HAVING

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.196
SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR NOT GOING

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.799
TO USE THOSE -- IF WE DON'T USE

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:45.434
UP ALL OF OUR PRE POSITIONING

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.069
DOLLARS THOSE DOLLARS COULD ALSO

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:50.739
BE USED FOR THE TRANSPONDERS AND

01:16:50.806 --> 01:16:53.141
THE GPS FOR LOCAL FIRE FOR THAT

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:54.309
SEASON -- AN ITEM I KNOW YOU

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:55.410
LOOKING AT GOING FOR BUT I THINK

01:16:55.477 --> 01:16:56.778
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.946
ABLE TO ADDRESS.

01:16:58.013 --> 01:16:58.680
I'LL TAKE THAT BACK TO CHIEF

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.615
PORTER A CAL FIRE AND GET BACK

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.150
TO YOU OFF LINE ON THAT.

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.852
THE OTHER CHALLENGE WEAKNESS I

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.053
THINK THAT WE CURRENT CURRENTLY

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.289
HAVE A ONE A ACKNOWLEDGE SENATOR

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:08.924
JACKSON'S SENATOR DODD TO OUR

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:12.427
TABLE -- AND ON ALL ISSUES OF

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:15.530
EMERGENCY ALERTS -- AND AT THE

01:17:15.597 --> 01:17:20.268
SAME TIME THOUGH WHEN WE HAVE A

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:20.836
NINE ONE ONE OUT EACH IN THE

01:17:20.902 --> 01:17:21.903
STATE.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:25.640
THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION -- AND

01:17:25.707 --> 01:17:26.174
THE LOCAL GUY.

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.976
DOES NOT KNOW WHEN NINE ONE ONE

01:17:28.043 --> 01:17:29.411
GOES OUT WHEN IT'S CAN COME BACK

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:30.979
IN WHEN TELECOM IS IF TELECOM IS

01:17:31.046 --> 01:17:31.513
WORKING.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.714
GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES IT TOOK

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:35.350
SIX HOURS. SIX HOURS DURING THE

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:39.855
CAMPFIRE FOR THE FCC. TO

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:41.723
CONTACTED PC.

01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:46.762
HI THAT THERE IS AN OUTAGE -- IN

01:17:46.828 --> 01:17:47.662
THE TO THE OFFICE EMERGENCY

01:17:47.729 --> 01:17:49.197
SERVICES NEVER KNEW.

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.299
TOOK FIVE HOURS IN THE TUBS.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:52.534
SO WHEN WE TAKE AND TAKE A LOOK

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.635
AT FIRE RESPONSE THERE NEEDS TO

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.337
BE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT LACK.

01:17:55.404 --> 01:17:56.938
OF COMMUNICATION IN FACT IT'S A

01:17:57.005 --> 01:17:59.674
DARK HOLE IF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:01.343
CAN'T SEND OUT EMERGENCY ALERTS.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:02.744
AND OR NINE ONE ONE GOES DOWN.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.780
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:06.014
INFORMATION BEING SHARED BETWEEN.

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:08.116
BY TELECOM DIRECTLY IN THE

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:09.451
OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES I

01:18:09.518 --> 01:18:10.752
THINK THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:12.421
WE'RE WHERE WE NEED TO BE OUT OF

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.223
FOCUS AND IS PUTTING LIVES AT

01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:18.894
RISK -- IN NO THEY NEED TO

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:19.928
EVALUATE THAT BUT JUST AS WE

01:18:19.995 --> 01:18:21.430
MOVE FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE

01:18:21.496 --> 01:18:22.864
ARE SOME REAL GAPS SAID.

01:18:22.931 --> 01:18:23.999
IN LOW HANGING FRUIT THAT WE CAN

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.000
ADDRESS.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:27.436
ANY -- SECURED A TO TALK ABOUT

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.438
THE CPUC BUT AN OLD A SECTOR

01:18:29.504 --> 01:18:30.372
CROWFOOT BUT THE YOU MAKE BOTH

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.306
POINTS ARE WELL MADE AND NOW

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.542
I'LL TAKE THAT BACK TO CAL FIRE --

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:35.077

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:51.026
ONE OF THE MORE CHALLENGING

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:51.660
AGENCIES.

01:18:51.726 --> 01:18:52.627
AS A MEMBER PUBLIC TO BETTER

01:18:52.694 --> 01:18:54.296
PARTICIPATED.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:56.131
WHERE I WOULD BE CONCERNED IS IF

01:18:56.198 --> 01:18:57.999
THIS LEGISLATION THE GOVERNOR'S

01:18:58.066 --> 01:19:00.769
LOOKING IN -- IN PROVIDING THEM

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:02.237
WITH MORE RESOURCES.

01:19:02.304 --> 01:19:03.972
WHEN SIMULTANEOUSLY IN HOUSE BE

01:19:04.039 --> 01:19:05.440
SIMULTANEOUSLY WE FIGURE OUT?

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:07.375
HOW TO BE ABLE TO READ THAT

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:09.778
AGENCY THE INTERVENOR STATUS --

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:12.414
IN A QUASI JUDICIAL PROCESS --

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.416
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE OF

REGULATORY REGULATING UTILITIES

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:19.287
AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT

01:19:19.354 --> 01:19:21.089
INVOLVING THE PUBLIC?

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:24.326
THE KWAZII JUDICIAL PROCESS.

01:19:24.392 --> 01:19:28.330
CAN'T B PART OF THE EQUATION --

01:19:28.396 --> 01:19:30.832
I'M UNFORTUNATE VERY FAMILIAR --

01:19:30.899 --> 01:19:33.101
WITH THE INTERVENOR STATUS IN IF

01:19:33.168 --> 01:19:34.336
I'M A NORMAL JOE.

01:19:34.402 --> 01:19:36.705
COMING FROM COFFEE PARK.

01:19:36.771 --> 01:19:38.707
AND MY HOUSES BURNED DOWN AND I

01:19:38.773 --> 01:19:40.175
WANT TO BE A PARTICIPATE ON

01:19:40.242 --> 01:19:41.209
WHATEVER THIS RESTRUCTURING MAY

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.678
BE FOR UTILITY I HAVE TO

01:19:43.745 --> 01:19:46.314
ACTUALLY I IF WE ARE TO KEEP

01:19:46.381 --> 01:19:47.282
THEIR CA AS A JUDICIAL

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:48.083
PROCESS.

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.784
I'D HAVE TO FILE TO BECOME AN

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.020
INTERVENOR AND THEN IT'LL HAVE

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.488
THAT STANDING TO BUILD INTERVENE

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:55.023
IN A PUBLIC PROCEEDING.

01:19:55.090 --> 01:19:57.726
AND THAT IS HOGWASH SO -- WHAT I

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.995
WOULD?

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:01.496
EXPECT IS THAT.

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:02.631
IF WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:04.166
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THERE HAS

01:20:04.232 --> 01:20:06.168
TO BE TWO PARALLEL SIMULTANEOUS

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:08.470
EFFORTS TO BE ABLE TO GET RID OF

01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:11.973
THAT -- INTERVENOR STATUS ON

01:20:12.040 --> 01:20:13.842
THIS ISSUE AND I DON'T KNOW MISS

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:14.476
MITCHELL IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:14.943
TO JUMP IN ON THAT.

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:15.610
SO WITH REGARD TO THE SPECIFICS

01:20:15.677 --> 01:20:17.245
OF THE INTERVENOR STATUS YOU%

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.513
PROBABLY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE

01:20:18.580 --> 01:20:20.148
WITH THAT THAN I DO I I WILL SAY

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:22.951

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:23.685
REPORT.

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.020
AND I AND I DO THINK THAT THAT

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:27.289
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE I

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.757
THINK THAT THAT PROCESS BECAUSE

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.325
I DIGITAL PROCESS IS NOT WELL

01:20:30.392 --> 01:20:32.060
SUITED. TO SOME OF THE THINGS

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.895
THAT NEED TO BE DONE AND AS PART

01:20:33.962 --> 01:20:35.430
OF A PUBLIC POLICY SOLUTION IN

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:36.565
DISTRICT FOUR IS CLEARLY

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:37.699
INDICATED THAT THAT SOMETHING

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:38.900
THAT YOU GUYS NEED TO CONSIDER

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:41.436
IN IN THE TOTALITY OF WHAT

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.170
YOU'RE GONNA DO IS WELFARE

01:20:42.237 --> 01:20:42.637
LIABILITY.

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.639
ALL I'M SAYING IS WE WE CAN'T

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:45.907
INVEST.

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:47.309
AND THEN MAKE THE DECISION IT

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.610
HAS TO BE DONE AT THE SAME TIME.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.712
I AND WE HAVE TO MAKE IT MUCH

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:52.547
MORE FRIENDLY FOR THOSE WHO ARE

01:20:52.614 --> 01:20:53.481
COMING FROM THE PUBLIC TO BETTER

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.984
PARTICIPATE AND I WON'T I KICKED

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:58.153
A DAY DE DOG UNDERNEATH THIS

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:58.853
DICE SO I BUT A MESSAGE KNOW

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:00.388
THAT POINT WELL TAKEN AND I WILL

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:01.289
TAKE IT BACK TO THE STRIKE.

01:21:01.356 --> 01:21:02.791
FORCE IN LASTING MISTER CHAIR IS

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:05.260
JUST ON THE ISSUE OF INSURANCE --

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:06.795
AND WHETHER IT'S SENATOR DODD'S

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.697
DISTRICT SENATOR JACKSON'S

01:21:08.763 --> 01:21:10.532
DISTRICT -- SENATOR CERN'S

01:21:10.599 --> 01:21:12.033
DISTRICT WE'RE SEEN SIGNIFICANT

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:20.375
NUMBERS OF HOMEOWNERS RECEIVING

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:23.278
NON RENEWAL NOTICES.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.079
EITHER THEY'RE IN THE WOOLLY.

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:24.713
THEY HAVE BEEN IN A COUNTY THAT

01:21:24.779 --> 01:21:26.781
HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY WILDFIRE.

01:21:26.848 --> 01:21:28.083
AND I THINK THAT WE ARE TEEN

01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:29.317
OURSELVES UP RIGHT NOW FOR

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:30.785
CRISIS REGARDS TO THE LACK OF

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:32.387
INSURANCE AND GIVE YOU ONE LAST

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:32.921
ANGEL EXAMPLE.

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:35.190
IF YOU'RE IN THE HILLS ABOVE YOU

01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.291
CAUGHT.

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.325
I THAT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.793
THE RANGE WHERE WE'VE HAD

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:39.561
SIGNIFICANT FIRES IN LEE COUNTY.

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.029
YOUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE WAS

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:42.330
HI IT WAS STILL ABOUT EIGHT

01:21:42.397 --> 01:21:43.398
THOUSAND A YEAR.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.233
OVER THE LAST YEAR FOLKS ARE

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.001
GETTING NON RENEWAL NOTICES

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:46.901
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO TO

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.403
INSURANCE OF LAST RESORT FOR THE

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.170
FAIR PLAN.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.405
AND THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET IN

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:51.973
OUT OF STATE WRITER THERE YOU

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.009
HAVE GONE FROM ABOUT EIGHT

01:21:54.075 --> 01:21:55.243
THOUSAND DOLLARS SUMMER NOW

01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:57.979
PAYING TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:58.546
SUMMER PAIN THIRTY THOUSAND

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:01.783
DOLLARS -- AND THAT IS A GROWING

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.486
CRISIS IN THE STATE -- AND IT'S

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:06.388
IMPACTING COUNTIES ALSO THAT

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:07.856
HAVE BEEN IN BEEN IMPACTED BY

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:09.357
FIRES THAT ARE MAYBE IN THE

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:09.591
MOVIE.

01:22:09.658 --> 01:22:11.226

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:13.194
THAT WE NEED TO BE WE WE CAN'T

01:22:13.261 --> 01:22:14.829

ISSUES THAT WAS IDENTIFIED IN

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:24.472
THE REPORT AND I DO THINK THE

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.341
NINE A ONE COMMISSION HAS DONE

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.542

COLLABORATION AND I CAN DIRECTLY

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.812
SPEAK TO AT THIS MOMENT.

01:28:04.879 --> 01:28:06.681
BECAUSE IT GOT MORE FOR

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:30.638
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DO NOTHING.

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:32.173
SO CENTERS WORK IF I COULD TAKE

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.708
THAT BECAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY PART

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:34.642
OF THE STRIKE FORCE

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:35.777
DELIBERATIONS A MISTER POLLOCK

01:28:35.843 --> 01:28:37.512
IS ACTUALLY BEEN BROUGHT IN TO

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:38.780
DO SOME SUBSEQUENT MODELING.

01:28:38.846 --> 01:28:40.548
AM I I BELIEVE THAT THE STRIKE

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:41.683
FORCES.

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:43.351
REPORT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT IT

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:44.419
DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT DOING

01:28:44.485 --> 01:28:46.421
NOTHING IS REALLY A GOOD OPTION

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:47.689
FOR CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.157
UTILITIES.

01:28:49.223 --> 01:28:50.558
DEAR ON THE BRINK OF OF

01:28:50.625 --> 01:28:51.793
BANKRUPTCY YOU HAVE RATING

01:28:51.859 --> 01:28:53.094
AGENCIES ARE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.063
PRESSURE ON CALIFORNIA AND YOU

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.432
HAVE P. JEANNIE IN IN BANKRUPTCY --

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.033
AND YOU HAVE A RISK OF A POST

01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:00.668
PETITION FIRE.

01:29:00.735 --> 01:29:01.436
SO I THINK THAT THE STRIKE FORCE

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:03.137
BELIEVES THAT ACTION IS IS

01:29:03.204 --> 01:29:03.838
IMPORTANT.

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:05.807
IT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:07.375
DATA I I APPRECIATE YOUR

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:08.710

THE ANSWER AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.748
I THINK IN THE CASE OF WHAT WHAT

01:29:13.815 --> 01:29:15.917
MISTER POLLOCK PRESENTED TODAY.

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.251
IT IS A MODEL THAT THE

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:18.453
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ASK US TO

01:29:18.519 --> 01:29:19.187
BUILD THAT IS INHERENTLY

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.355
ITERATIVE AND SO THE IDEA IS TO

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:24.225
START THAT PARTICULAR DIALOGUE.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:25.026
I DON'T THINK THAT MR BOLICK OR

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:26.627
I HAVE A VIEW ON EXACTLY WHAT

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:27.795
THE RIGHT ANSWER IS I DON'T

01:29:27.862 --> 01:29:29.097
THINK THE RATING AGENCIES HAVE

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.031
TOLD US.

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:31.132
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU IN

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:32.633
THE GOVERNOR HAVE A VIEW ABOUT

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.435
THE FUTURE OF WILD FIRE RISK IN

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.537
CALIFORNIA YOU CAN FAIRLY EASY

01:29:36.604 --> 01:29:38.573
EASILYMODEL AN OUTCOME -- AND I

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.540
THINK YOU CAN GET TO SOMETHING

01:29:39.607 --> 01:29:41.476
THAT THEN YOU YOU WILL BE ABLE

01:29:41.542 --> 01:29:42.410
TO PRESENT TO THE RATING

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.711
AGENCIES AND THEY WERE VIEWED AS

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:46.748
A POSITIVE MOVE FORWARD FOR FOR

01:29:46.814 --> 01:29:48.583
CALIFORNIA.

01:29:48.649 --> 01:29:49.784
FOLLOW LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:50.084
WAS.

01:29:50.151 --> 01:29:51.986
IF YOU MARRY THESE TWO IDEAS

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:54.055
WHICH I'M TRYING TO GET.

01:29:54.122 --> 01:29:54.989
TO IF WE HVE TO THE JULY

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.458
TWELFTH AND YOU LOOK AT THAT THE

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:58.926
FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

01:29:58.993 --> 01:30:00.361
APPROPRIATELY IS DEEPLY ENGAGED

01:30:00.428 --> 01:30:02.597
IN BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS IS NOT A

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:03.798
STANDALONE ISSUE.

01:30:03.865 --> 01:30:05.099
THERE'S HUGE NUMBER OF ISSUES

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.434
THAT ARE FUNDING FOR THIS

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:07.468
LEGISLATURE AND BEFORE THE STATE

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:08.803
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:09.537
AND YOU LOOK AT THIS EVENT

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.405
HORIZON YOU LOOK AT THE TIMING

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:12.907
OF THE THE THE BILL PUSHED

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.176
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA AND WHAT

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.344
WE'VE GOT TO DO.

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.645
YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:18.546
UNDERSTAND THIS IS SOMETHING WE

01:30:18.613 --> 01:30:20.047
CAN RELY ON HOW MUCH TIME WE

01:30:20.114 --> 01:30:21.682
HAVE BECAUSE WE HAVE A CLOCK.

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.918
THAT IF WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

01:30:23.985 --> 01:30:26.687
AND THIS IS ONLY THIS BROAD GAS

01:30:26.754 --> 01:30:28.122
HOW DO WE GET THERE.

01:30:28.189 --> 01:30:30.691
ARE A IN THAT TIME FRAME.

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:33.494
WHICH GOES UNDER THE IN THE

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:34.662
RUBRIC OF IF WE DO NOTHING.

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:35.797
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME GUIDANCE

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.398
FOR PURPOSES OF HELPING I

01:30:37.465 --> 01:30:38.432
LEGISLATURE COME UP WITH SOME

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:39.567
ANSWERS IN COORDINATION WITH

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:41.002
GRAY PRITCHETT THAT AND I THINK

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:42.603
THAT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK

01:30:42.670 --> 01:30:44.205
THAT'S BEING DONE TO ADVANCE

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:44.405
THAT.

01:30:44.472 --> 01:30:46.407
PARTICULAR BALL I DO THINK THAT

01:30:46.474 --> 01:30:47.542
IN THIS CASE THIS IS ABOUT

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:49.777
PRESENTING YOU A SET OF METRICS

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:50.778
THAT YOU CAN USE.

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:52.480
I'M I DO THINK THAT SUBSEQUENT

01:30:52.547 --> 01:30:54.682
DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:56.117
AND THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE ABOUT

01:30:56.184 --> 01:30:57.451
EXACTLY WHAT YOU THINK THE

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:58.653
APPROPRIATE METRICS ARE.

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:00.788
THE MODEL IS FAIRLY EASY TO

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.557
OPERATE ONCE YOU START CHANGING

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:03.491
THE METRICS AND IT IS REALLY

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:05.126
SENSITIVE TO SOME OF THE METRICS

01:31:05.193 --> 01:31:06.460
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:31:06.527 --> 01:31:09.096
YOU COME TO A POLICY VIEW.

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.264
ON THOSE ISSUES.

01:31:10.331 --> 01:31:11.666
I WOULD JUST CLOSE ON THAT PUT

01:31:11.732 --> 01:31:13.034
THAT POINT SAY SUFFICE IT TO SAY

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:13.801
I THINK WE NEED MORE YEP

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.204
QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON THAT.

01:31:16.270 --> 01:31:17.672
AND SO THAT WE CAN REALLY

01:31:17.738 --> 01:31:19.473
UNDERSTAND WE WHAT THE

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.875
PARAMETERS ARE PUTTING AROUND

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.009
THESE THINGS ARE WE DON'T KNOW

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:24.912
WHAT -- YEAH PARAMETERS ARE IN

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:27.582
THAT SO WE JUST GETTING A GRAPH

01:31:27.648 --> 01:31:29.317
AND SO.

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:29.817
DON'T WANT TO SHOOT THE

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:30.852
MESSENGER WE WANT TO KEEP

01:31:30.918 --> 01:31:32.119
WORKING WITH YOU WE NEED THAT.

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:33.921
MORE ASSESSMENT THERE.

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.957
I CENTER JACKSON IS THANK YOU

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:38.926
VERY MUCH I WANT TO THE SHIFT US

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:40.595
BACK A MINUTE -- BECAUSE I DON'T

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.729
THINK WE'RE DOING NOTHING WE'RE

01:31:41.796 --> 01:31:43.631
DOING A LOT -- YOU MENTIONED THE

01:31:43.698 --> 01:31:45.266
FOR ITEMS STRENGTHENING THE

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.901
FIREFIGHTERS ABILITIES AND SO

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:47.134
FORTH.

01:31:47.201 --> 01:31:48.369
WHEN WE DID AS I MENTIONED

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:50.104
EARLIER WE PASSED LEGISLATION

01:31:50.171 --> 01:31:51.639
LAST YEAR TO ADDRESS THE

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:54.008
RESILIENCY IN COMMUNITIES -- A

01:31:54.075 --> 01:31:55.743
LOT OF WORK WE DID. TO BUILD

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:57.845
AWARENESS TO HARDEN CREATE

01:31:57.912 --> 01:32:00.648
DEFENSIBLE SPACE -- PROVIDING

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.416
EVACUATION ROUTES DOING MORE AND

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.485
LOCAL PLANNING -- ASSESSING OUR

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.187
VULNERABILITIES IN ADDRESSING

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:09.824
THEM -- PROVIDING -- IMPROVING

01:32:09.891 --> 01:32:11.058
OUR FOREST MANAGEMENT HEALTH.

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:12.827
A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:15.930
NOW -- AND IN MY POINT EARLIER

01:32:15.997 --> 01:32:17.265
WAS THAT WE NEED THE FUNDING FOR

01:32:17.331 --> 01:32:18.499
THESE THINGS WE'VE GOT THEM IN

01:32:18.566 --> 01:32:20.334
PLACE WE'VE AUTHORIZED CAL FIRE

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:22.703
WE'VE AUTHORIZE FORCE MANAGEMENT.

01:32:22.770 --> 01:32:24.672
SERVICE WE GOT TO WORK ON THE

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:25.840
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:27.008
STEP UP IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:29.010
WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST BE ABLE.

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.278
TO TO TO TAKE A BROOM AND AND

01:32:30.344 --> 01:32:32.380
CLEAN UP THE FORCE AND 56% OF

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:34.515
MORE FEDERAL ANYWAY I HAVE A LOT

01:32:34.582 --> 01:32:37.018
OF MY DISTRICT -- SO WHEN WE HAD

01:32:37.084 --> 01:32:38.819
OUR FIRES WE ACTUALLY PUSH THE

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:40.588
FIRE INTO THE BACK COUNTRY WHICH

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:47.528
IS FEDERAL LAND -- IN ORDER TO

01:32:47.595 --> 01:32:49.463
PROTECT OUR OUR POPULATION IN

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:52.967
OUR IN OUR PROPERTY SO -- AND AS

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.568
WE LOOK GOING FORWARD AT WHAT

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:58.572
NEEDS TO BE DONE I I FIND MYSELF --

01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:00.775
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT I KNOW THE

01:33:00.841 --> 01:33:02.910
UTILITY COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:04.645
FOCUSING ON THIS ISN'T THE

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:07.548
SAFETY BRAIN THE FACT THAT -- IN

01:33:07.615 --> 01:33:09.483
THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF LAST

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:11.786
YEAR -- P. JEANNIE SPENT OVER

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.421
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS LOBBYING

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:16.023
THIS BUILDING. FOR A TO GET RID

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:18.192
OF THEIR STRICT LIABILITY AN

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:20.294
INVERSE CONDEMNATION THAT THEY

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:21.429
OVER THE PAST DECADE HAVE GIVEN

01:33:21.495 --> 01:33:22.730
OUT MORE THAN FOUR BILLION

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:24.332
DOLLARS TO THE TO THEIR

01:33:24.398 --> 01:33:26.500
SHAREHOLDERS -- I LOOK AT THAT

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:28.135
IS MONEY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.037
USED AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:32.039
TO HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.374
TO TO PROTECT AGAINST THESE

01:33:33.441 --> 01:33:34.075
FIRES.

01:33:34.141 --> 01:33:36.410
AND SO -- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:37.878
WAS MENTIONED IS THIS INVERSE

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:39.747
CONDEMNATION I'M NOT SURE -- I'M

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:41.449
NOT REAL CLEAR ON WHETHER THAT

01:33:41.515 --> 01:33:43.551
IS INCORPORATED INTO THOSE THREE

01:33:43.617 --> 01:33:45.753
ITEMS THE THREE OPTIONS YOU

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:46.187
TALKED ABOUT.

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:48.122
BUT FIRST OF ALL AS YOU KNOW --

01:33:48.189 --> 01:33:49.957
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:52.193
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT SO I

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.261
DON'T I DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:56.297
LEGISLATURE CONTRAST -- CHANGE

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:59.066
WHAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE --

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:01.268
BY LEGISLATION OUR STATUTORY

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:03.004
AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE

01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:06.107
CONSTITUTION -- IF WE WANT TO DO

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:06.874
A A BALLOT INITIATIVE A P.

01:34:06.941 --> 01:34:08.275
JEANNIE WANTS TO DO A BALLOT

01:34:08.342 --> 01:34:09.610
INITIATIVE I WOULD SUSPECT THAT

01:34:09.677 --> 01:34:11.278
THE POPULATION IS NOT GOING TO

01:34:11.345 --> 01:34:11.846
BE JUMPING.

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:14.348
AT THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:16.684
LIABILITY OF THESE COMPANIES.

01:34:16.751 --> 01:34:17.618
AND IN PART OF IT CENTER WITH

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:18.819
WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT CAN

01:34:18.886 --> 01:34:20.054
YOU JUST LIMIT YOUR YOUR

01:34:20.121 --> 01:34:22.990
QUESTIONS TO WHAT WE TALKED

01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:24.125
ABOUT HERE WE HAVEN'T REALLY.

01:34:24.191 --> 01:34:29.730
IS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED HERE

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:32.633
TODAY IN VERSE IS NOT.

01:34:32.700 --> 01:34:34.101
WELLIN VERSE WAS ONE ON ITEMS

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:35.069
WHAT'S THAT IN VERSE WAS THE

01:34:35.136 --> 01:34:37.138
SECOND OF THE THREE SIX CONCEPTS

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:38.072
THAT WAS PRESENTED HERE AND I

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:38.706
JUST WANT TO I HEARD THAT BUT I

01:34:38.773 --> 01:34:39.373
DON'T THINK ANYBODY INDIVIDUALLY

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.441
IS COME UP WITH A PLAN ON HOW IN

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:40.975
VERSE WOULD BE CHANGED.

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.376
AT THIS TIME I JUST WHAT WE'VE

01:34:42.443 --> 01:34:43.844
GOT IS THE NEXT SPEAKERS ARE

01:34:43.911 --> 01:34:46.080
GOING TO BE -- YOU HAVE TO LEAVE

01:34:46.147 --> 01:34:47.848
HERE AT THREE FORTY FIVE SO WE

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:49.817
GOT TO KIND OF MOVE.

01:34:49.884 --> 01:34:50.551
WELL THEN WHY DON'T I PUT IT

01:34:50.618 --> 01:34:51.419
FRIEDMAN IN THE TERM OF A

01:34:51.485 --> 01:34:53.988
CONTEXT THE QUESTION BECAUSE IT

01:34:54.055 --> 01:34:56.123
WAS REYES WAS IT IS ONE OF THE

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:57.091
AND SO.

01:34:57.158 --> 01:34:58.526
BUT BOTTOM LINE IS I WANTED YOUR

01:34:58.592 --> 01:34:59.760
THOUGHTS ON THE WHOLE

01:34:59.827 --> 01:35:02.496
CONSTITUTIONALITY ISSUE AND WHY

01:35:02.563 --> 01:35:04.532
THAT IS BEING PROPOSED WHEN WE

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:07.334
CAN'T GET THEM TO DO SAFETY --

01:35:07.401 --> 01:35:09.136
WHERE THEY HAVE STRICT LIABILITY

01:35:09.203 --> 01:35:11.172
HOW DO YOU ARE HOW DOES ANYONE

01:35:11.238 --> 01:35:12.406
IS PROPOSED THAT?

01:35:12.473 --> 01:35:13.574
SUGGESTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.843
BE MORE RESPONSIBLE WITH LESS

01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:21.482
LIABILITY THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS.

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:22.516
I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:23.484
SENATOR JACKSON AND LET ME THANK

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:24.418
YOU THE FOLLOWING TWO THINGS THE

01:35:24.485 --> 01:35:25.286
FIRST IS ON THE SAFETY

01:35:25.352 --> 01:35:26.620
INCENTIVES I THINK THAT THE

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.189
REPORT IS A CLEAR THAT ANY

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:29.590
SOLUTION.

01:35:29.657 --> 01:35:31.826
WHAT YOU OPTED AND THAT COULD BE

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:33.394
OPTION TO IT COULD BE CONCEPT

01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:34.595
ONE IT COULD BE CONCEPT THREE

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:35.830
THAT THAT FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.364
PERSPECTIVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:38.566
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CREATE

01:35:38.632 --> 01:35:40.101
INCENTIVES FOR THE UTILITIES TO

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:41.302
ACT?

01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:42.937
IN A SAFE AND PRUDENT MANNER.

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:44.772
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO WITH A

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:45.973
LIABILITIES STANDARD OR NOT A

01:35:46.040 --> 01:35:48.275
LIABILITY STANDARD THE REPORT

01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:49.410
DOES NOT RECOMMEND NOR DO I

01:35:49.477 --> 01:35:50.177
THINK ANY OF YOU WOULD FIND IT

01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:52.246
ACCEPTABLE. TO ALLOW UTILITY

01:35:52.313 --> 01:35:54.014
INVESTORS OFF THE HOOK FOR BAD

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:55.916
ACTIONS I'M IN SO I I THINK THAT

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.151
THAT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT

01:35:57.218 --> 01:35:59.220
OF ANY SOLUTION WITH REGARD TO

01:35:59.286 --> 01:36:00.721
THE CONSTITUTIONALITY.

01:36:00.788 --> 01:36:02.189
INVERSE CONDEMNATION IS A

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:04.558
CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE I THINK

01:36:04.625 --> 01:36:06.594
IT IS CLEAR FROM A FROM A LOT OF

01:36:06.660 --> 01:36:07.228
THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:09.563
PUBLIC THAT THERE ARE.

01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:10.698
POTENTIALLY WAY IS THAT THE

01:36:10.764 --> 01:36:12.133
LEGISLATURE MAY BE ABLE TO

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.434
INFORM THE APPLICATION OF

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:14.969
INVERSE CONDEMNATION AND WHAT

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.837
OPTION TWO IS TALKING ABOUT IS

01:36:16.904 --> 01:36:19.039
AN EXPLORATION WITH REGARD.

01:36:19.106 --> 01:36:20.708
TO THE THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:36:20.774 --> 01:36:22.243
CHANGING INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE

01:36:22.309 --> 01:36:24.411
STANDARD OF LIABILITY WHICH MAY

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:25.846
NOT BE EIGHT EIGHT

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:27.348
CONSTITUTIONAL DOCTRINE I'M NOT

01:36:27.414 --> 01:36:28.115
GONNA TELL YOU THERE AREN'T

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:29.550
LEGAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:30.851
I THINK THE REPORT CLEARLY

01:36:30.918 --> 01:36:32.186
CALLED OUT THAT YOU WOULD HAVE

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.320
TO FURTHER EVALUATE THAT.

01:36:33.387 --> 01:36:34.388
BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.323
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS PART

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:37.791
OF OPTION TWO WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:36:37.858 --> 01:36:39.493
LEGISLATIVE THE LEGISLATURE

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:42.396
EXERCISING ITS APPROPRIATE ACT --

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:44.031
AS THE LEGISLATIVE BOY TO

01:36:44.098 --> 01:36:49.470
INFORM THE THE APPLICATION OF

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:52.573
INVERSE CONDEMNATION.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.241
SIR WITH HOUSEKEEPING.

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:55.409
COMING BACK TO PART THREE THE

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:57.545
PRINCIPLES -- I THINK YOU TALK

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:59.780
ABOUT -- REQUIRING EQUITABLE A

01:36:59.847 --> 01:37:01.515
STAKEHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS AND

01:37:01.582 --> 01:37:03.184
FLY YOU TALK ABOUT THE VICTIMS

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.518
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.421
INSURANCE WE DON'T INCLUDE THE

01:37:07.488 --> 01:37:08.622
ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WHO LIVE

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:10.057
IN THE WILDLIFE.

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:13.928
URBAN INTERFACE -- BECAUSE THAT

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:14.728
SET THE AND I WANT TO KNOW IS

01:37:14.795 --> 01:37:15.596
THAT.

01:37:15.663 --> 01:37:16.664
JUST AN OVERSIGHT OR IS IT YOU

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.265
KNOW WE'VE WE'RE LOOKING AT A

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.967
DIFFERENT POPULATION THAT HIS

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:22.002
CHOOSING TO LIVE IN AN AREA THAT

01:37:22.069 --> 01:37:24.071
NOW BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:25.439
HE'S GOT A MUCH HIGHER RISK.

01:37:25.506 --> 01:37:26.574
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHERE

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:27.541
WHERE THEY CAN MAKE

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:31.545
CONTRIBUTIONS ALSO OTHER THAN

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:34.582
THEIR INSURANCE COVERAGE.

01:37:34.648 --> 01:37:34.748
SO.

01:37:34.815 --> 01:37:35.849
I'M CENTER CASKEY WITH REGARD TO

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:36.483
THAT ANYTHING THAT THE PURPOSE

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:37.117
OR THE PRINCIPLE THAT WAS LAID

01:37:37.184 --> 01:37:38.452
OUT THERE IS TO MAKE THE POINT

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:39.853
THAT.

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:41.288
NO ONE CONSTITUENCY.

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.490
CAN AFFORD TO PAY THE TOTAL COST

01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:44.959
OF THE WILDFIRE DAMAGE DEPENDING

01:37:45.025 --> 01:37:46.460
ON WHAT YOUR ASSUMPTION IS ABOUT

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:48.662
THE FUTURE OF OF WILDFIRE

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:52.199
DAMAGING IN CALIFORNIA GOING

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:52.433
FORWARD.

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:53.100
IS SO.

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:53.667
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS AN

01:37:53.734 --> 01:37:55.269
ADVISER WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU IS

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:57.605
THAT YOU HAVE THE THE POLICY

01:37:57.671 --> 01:37:59.773
MAKERS HAVE THE UNFORTUNATE.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.609
JOB I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.077
TO BETTER SPREAD THOSE COSTS.

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.778
THE PURPOSE OF THAT PARTICULAR

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.547
POINTIS ONLY THAT WHATEVER YOU

01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.749
THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE SHARING.

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:11.185
OF AMONG THE CONSTITUENTS THAT

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:12.953
THAT ARE AFFECTED BY THIS WHICH

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.388
IS REALLY EVERY CALIFORNIAN IN

01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:15.155
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:16.590
HE IS A DECISION THAT YOU'RE

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:17.424
GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE IS A

01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:18.826
LEGISLATURE BUT THAT LEAVING THE

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:21.061
COST OR PUTTING THE COST ON ONLY

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.329
ONE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS.

01:38:22.396 --> 01:38:23.764
IS PROBABLY NOT A VIABLE LONG

01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:25.266
TERM SOLUTION I GUESS MY MY

01:38:25.332 --> 01:38:26.867
OBSERVATION WITH TO BE PART OF

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:28.102
THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS

01:38:28.168 --> 01:38:32.439
DEALING CAP AND TRADE WAS -- TO

01:38:32.506 --> 01:38:34.341
REPEALS THE S. R. A FEE OF A

01:38:34.408 --> 01:38:35.009
HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:37.311
PEOPLE THAT WERE LIVING IN THAT

01:38:37.378 --> 01:38:39.947
THE WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.682
WERE PAYING SO IT APPEARS THAT.

01:38:41.749 --> 01:38:42.650
THEY'RE NOT MAKING ANY

01:38:42.716 --> 01:38:45.019
CONTRIBUTION OTHER THAN YOU KNOW

01:38:45.085 --> 01:38:46.320
THAT BEING VICTIMS BEING VICTIMS

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:48.455
ARE JUST SPOT THAT ISSUE BECAUSE

01:38:48.522 --> 01:38:50.824
THAT'S A DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE

01:38:50.891 --> 01:38:52.293
HAVING.

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:53.394
HERE AND ON MY SIDE I GUESS THE

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:55.062
OTHER QUESTION IS ON THE AND

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:56.563
USE DECISIONS THERE'S NO

01:38:56.630 --> 01:38:58.232
DISCUSSION OF PENALTIES FOR

01:38:58.299 --> 01:38:59.433
LOCALITIES AND I WAS WONDERING

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.534
IF THAT WAS YOU KNOW IF YOU

01:39:00.601 --> 01:39:02.102
DON'T USE THE BEST.

01:39:02.169 --> 01:39:06.206
IF WE DEVELOP BEST.

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:07.641
PRACTICES IN PLANNING IN.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:08.275
SOME OF THESE LOCALITIES WE'VE

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.978
HAD OTHER LEGISLATION THAT WE'VE

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:12.146
TAKEN IT JUST SORT OF BLOW US

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.213
OFF WHEN IT'S SUCH A GIVEN THE

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.215
CLIMATE CHANGE GIVEN THAT.

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:17.618
THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT

01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:19.653
FOLLOWING THESE BEST PRACTICES

01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:20.220
IF YOU GUYS HAD ANY IDEAS ON

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:23.157
THAT.

01:39:23.223 --> 01:39:25.092
WELL POINT TAKEN ON I I THINK

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:27.328
THERE -- THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING

01:39:27.394 --> 01:39:29.530
REGARDING.

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.298
THOSE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:32.700
WILD MAN URBAN INTERFACE AND

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.868
YOUR POINT YOUR POINT IS THAT.

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:35.469
I THINK IS PERHAPS THAT THEY

01:39:35.536 --> 01:39:38.005
SHOULD THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED --

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:39.707
CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS EFFORT SO I

01:39:39.773 --> 01:39:41.308
THINK THAT'S A FAIR CONTRIBUTION

01:39:41.375 --> 01:39:42.443
THE DISCUSSION.

01:39:42.509 --> 01:39:44.745
AS IT RELATES TO LAND USE YOU

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:46.880
KNOW WE'VE DEFINITELY CALLED OUT

01:39:46.947 --> 01:39:49.183
THE NEED. TO FOR FOR LOCAL

01:39:49.249 --> 01:39:50.751
GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN MORE

01:39:50.818 --> 01:39:51.952
CAREFULLY.

01:39:52.019 --> 01:39:54.822
HI AND TO BUILD FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:55.689
THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENTS

01:39:55.756 --> 01:39:56.957
SHRINK THE PUBLIC SAFETY ELEMENT

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.158
OF THE GENERAL PLAN.

01:39:58.225 --> 01:40:00.461
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T CALL --

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:02.863
FOR YOU KNOW PENALTIES -- AROUND --

01:40:02.930 --> 01:40:05.632
COMPANIES FOR INCORPORATED TOWNS

01:40:05.699 --> 01:40:06.834
FOR THE WAY THAT THEIR WITH

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:07.801
THEIR BUILDING.

01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:08.902
I MEAN I'M NOT GOING TO WIN ANY

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:10.337
AWARDS AND BEING COMPASSIONATE

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:12.406
BUT I I UNDERSTAND I I NOTE THAT

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:15.075
THE GOVERNOR CAME IN WITH --

01:40:15.142 --> 01:40:16.710
MONEY FOR BIãU COUNTY FOR

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:17.978
THREE YEARS TO PAY THE LOSS THAT

01:40:18.045 --> 01:40:19.113
THEY HAD AD REAL ESTATE REAL

01:40:19.179 --> 01:40:20.381
PROPERTY TAXES BUT THERE WASN'T

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:22.182
ANY CONDITION THEY HAD TO CHANGE

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.518
ANY PRACTICES AND AND WE'VE HAD

01:40:24.585 --> 01:40:26.019
BEFORE SUB TO WE'VE HAD WATER

01:40:26.086 --> 01:40:28.188
DISTRICTS THAT DON'T WANT TO

01:40:28.255 --> 01:40:29.356
CHANGE ANYTHING.

01:40:29.423 --> 01:40:30.824
CERTAINLY NEED THE MONEY SO I

01:40:30.891 --> 01:40:31.992
THINK I'VE GOT THOSE WE GOT THE

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:33.761
POINT APPRECIATED BRING THAT UP

01:40:33.827 --> 01:40:35.162

GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT --

01:40:41.135 --> 01:40:43.237
CENTER STERN.

CENTER RUBIO DID YOU WANT ONE

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:46.840

CHAPARRAL AND THE UNIQUE

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:04.625
CHALLENGES OF THE SOUTH I KNOW

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:05.592
THAT WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON BIG

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.127
TREES I APPRECIATE THE

01:41:07.194 --> 01:41:08.529
CALIFORNIA FUEL MITIGATION PLAN

01:41:08.595 --> 01:41:10.063
WAYS BIG TREES VERY HEAVILY IN

01:41:10.130 --> 01:41:10.831
THEIR METHODOLOGY.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:13.700
LOOKS IT BIG CARBON.

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:15.702
BUT I STILL THINK WE'RE LACKING

01:41:15.769 --> 01:41:18.272
A REAL PLAN FOR SOUTHERN

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:20.641
CALIFORNIA AND NON TIMBER

01:41:20.707 --> 01:41:23.043
ORIENTED WILD FIRE RISK.

JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR YOUR

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.013
QUICK TAKE ON THAT I DON'T THINK

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.314
PRESCRIBED BURNS I JUST SAY FOR

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:29.149
THE RECORD I DO NOT THINK

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:29.750
PRESCRIBED BURNS WORK WELL IN

01:41:29.817 --> 01:41:30.951
THE CHAPARRAL.

01:41:31.018 --> 01:41:32.019
YOU DESTROY THAT HABITAT AND

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.454
IT'S GONE FOREVER AND YOU LOSE

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:35.389
ANY OF BROWN OFF ANOTHER ISSUE

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:36.490
SO WHEN YOU GET YOUR QUICK

01:41:36.557 --> 01:41:38.158
COMMENTS ON THAT SECOND THE

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:41.028
COMMENTS ON HARDENING AND PASTRY

01:41:41.094 --> 01:41:42.095
ENCOURAGED TO SEE WHAT COMES

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.230
FORWARD ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:44.932
GOING TO BE A PEOPLE I DISLIKE

01:41:44.998 --> 01:41:45.299
QUESTION.

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:48.202
I HEARD SO -- SO THOUGHTS ON

01:41:48.268 --> 01:41:49.636
THAT REGION I THINK YOU RAISE A

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:51.238
GOOD POINT IS A REALLY TO

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.539
CHAPARRAL I THINK THAT.

01:41:52.606 --> 01:41:54.208
TRADITIONAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN

EFFECTIVE WAYS TO MANAGE THE

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:17.190
PROBLEM IS TO MAKE IT SMALLER.

01:53:17.257 --> 01:53:19.392

THE CONCLUSIONS OF THAT.

01:56:03.723 --> 01:56:04.957
WEISMANN MEMO.

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:06.993
I THINK DIRECTIONALLY THE

01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:08.628
WEISSMAN MEMO IS.

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:13.299
IS PROBABLY IN THE BRADY I A IS

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.968
ACCURATE I THINK THAT THERE ARE

01:56:16.035 --> 01:56:18.438
SO MANY FACTORS TO INTERVENE.

01:56:18.504 --> 01:56:20.840
BETWEEN THE CREATION OF THESE

01:56:20.907 --> 01:56:23.109
LIABILITIES DURING CATASTROPHIC

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:25.678
WILDFIRES AND YOU KNOW WHAT RATE

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:27.714
PAYERS AND UP PAYING AND WHEN

01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:28.948
THEY CAN BE HARD TO PIN DOWN THE

01:56:29.015 --> 01:56:30.216
EXACT DOLLAR VALUE BUT I THINK

01:56:30.283 --> 01:56:31.684
IT'S SAFE TO SAY.

01:56:31.751 --> 01:56:34.487
THAT SIGNIFICANT -- WE SAW AS

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:35.788
WAS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:38.958
PANEL RECENTLY THAT -- THE ALL

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:40.093
OF THE I. O. USED TO PUT IN FOR

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:42.395
LARGE COST OF CAPITAL INCREASES

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:45.031
THAT WAS PREDICTABLE -- AND THE

01:56:45.098 --> 01:56:46.999
CREDIT QUALITY OF ALL OF THE I

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:48.801
USE HAS BEEN DETERIORATING OVER

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:49.702
TIME.

01:56:49.769 --> 01:56:51.537
AND I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER KIND

01:56:51.604 --> 01:56:54.574
OF SIGN OF FUTURE INCREASED

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:56.075
REPAIR COSTS IF NOTHING HAPPENS.

01:56:56.142 --> 01:56:57.377
CAN YOU FOR THE FOR THE LAY

01:56:57.443 --> 01:57:01.114
PEOPLE TURNING IN. FOR OTHERS IN

01:57:01.180 --> 01:57:02.448
THE PUBLIC WATCHING WHO DON'T

01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:03.683
UNDERSTAND HOW THE COST OF

01:57:03.750 --> 01:57:05.485
CAPITAL PROCEEDING WORKS Y. Y.

01:57:05.551 --> 01:57:07.653
E. WHAT IS THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:09.122
RATES AND WHAT WILL THAT DO SURE

01:57:09.188 --> 01:57:12.125
SO IN ESSENCE -- UTILITIES USE

01:57:12.191 --> 01:57:14.494
RATES TO PAY FOR THEIR EXPENSES

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:16.829
THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES AND TO

01:57:16.896 --> 01:57:18.364
PAY FOR THE COST.

01:57:18.431 --> 01:57:21.367
TO THE THE INTEREST ON THE MONEY

01:57:21.434 --> 01:57:24.203
THAT THEY USED TO FINANCE AND

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.505
BUILD ALL OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:28.007
AND THE CALL THE INTEREST RATE

01:57:28.074 --> 01:57:29.809
ESSENTIALLY IS GOING UP.

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:32.044
IN CALIFORNIA THE YOU KNOW WE

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:33.646
YOU COULD THINK OF IT IN VERY

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:36.115
YES SIR TO TO BE SPEAKING VERY

01:57:36.182 --> 01:57:37.650
METAPHORICAL TERMS HERE.

01:57:37.717 --> 01:57:39.152
YOU KNOW IT USED TO BE THAT WE

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:40.553
COULD GET SORT OF A THIRTY YEAR

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.622
MORTGAGE ON OUR TO FINANCE AND

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:44.891
BUILD OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.859
AND WE'RE EVOLVING TOWARD A

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:48.961
SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE TO BUILD

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:50.530
IT WITH HEY PUT ON A CREDIT CARD

01:57:50.596 --> 01:57:51.464
AND PAY CREDIT CARD INTEREST

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.365
RATE.

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:52.965
RATHER THAN A HOME MORTGAGE

01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:53.966
RATES.

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:56.569
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE MARKETS

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:59.038
ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:00.339
INTEGRITY OF THE UTILITIES AND

01:58:00.406 --> 01:58:02.608
SO THEY DEMAND A HIGHER INTEREST

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:04.544
RATE. TO LOAN TO THEM EITHER

01:58:04.610 --> 01:58:06.112
LOAN IN THE FORM OF OF DEBTS

01:58:06.179 --> 01:58:09.582
RIGHT BONDS OR EQUITY.

01:58:09.649 --> 01:58:10.416
AND SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S A

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:12.585
PROBLEM JUST LIMITED TO P.

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:15.087
JEANNIE OR DO YOU THINK IT'S

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:16.322
ACROSS UTILITIES AROUND THE

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:18.524
STATE IN THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:20.026
THE CREDIT RATING AGENCIES HAVE

01:58:20.092 --> 01:58:21.694
MADE IT VERY CLEAR THEY CONSIDER

01:58:21.761 --> 01:58:23.463
THIS A CALIFORNIA WIDE PROBLEM.

01:58:23.529 --> 01:58:25.064
WE HEARD TESTIMONY ALSO IN THIS

01:58:25.131 --> 01:58:26.499
THIS JUST TO GO TO YOUR PUBLICLY

01:58:26.566 --> 01:58:28.668
ON UTILITY QUESTION WE HEARD --

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.036
MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF TESTIMONY

01:58:30.102 --> 01:58:31.537
FROM PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES

01:58:31.604 --> 01:58:32.839
THAT INDICATED THAT THEY ARE

01:58:32.905 --> 01:58:33.739
HAVING.

01:58:33.806 --> 01:58:35.608
A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROBLEM

01:58:35.675 --> 01:58:37.043
THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO GET.

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:40.446
BY A GENERAL LIABILITY COVERAGE

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:42.582
FOR THEIR OPERATIONS -- IT

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.283
BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:45.618
THAT WOULD GENERALLY COVER THEM

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:46.986
ARE GETTING REALLY NERVOUS

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:48.254
BECAUSE OF THIS FIRE ISSUE

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:48.554
[inaudible]

01:58:48.621 --> 01:58:51.123
AND SO.

01:58:51.190 --> 01:58:53.326
IN A IN A PRUDENTLY MANAGED

01:58:53.392 --> 01:58:56.095
UTILITY IS THIS STILL.

01:58:56.162 --> 01:58:57.396
IS THIS STILL A RISK FOR

01:58:57.463 --> 01:58:59.832
RATEPAYERS IN THOSE TERRITORIES.

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:03.002
EVEN IF EVEN IF -- SEMPRA OR

01:59:03.069 --> 01:59:06.839
PIERRE OR EDICION OR D. W. P. OR

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.374
SMUD.

01:59:08.441 --> 01:59:10.376
HAVE WENT FULL STEAM AHEAD WITH

01:59:10.443 --> 01:59:11.544
THEIR NINE OH ONE MITIGATION

01:59:11.611 --> 01:59:13.279
PLANS AND WE HAD A WHOLE HOME

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:15.748
HARDENING SYSTEM DO YOU STILL

01:59:15.815 --> 01:59:16.949
ANTICIPATE INCREASED RATE

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:18.885
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AND REPAIR

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.419
COSTS AROUND THE STATE -- I

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:22.488
THINK FOR THE TIME BEING UNTIL

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:23.890
THERE'S A TRACK RCORD.

01:59:23.956 --> 01:59:25.658
PERHAPS AND THIS IS ME SPEAKING

01:59:25.725 --> 01:59:26.926
MY PERSONAL CAPACITY I'M NOT ON

01:59:26.993 --> 01:59:27.827
THE AFTER THE COMMISSION I'M

01:59:27.894 --> 01:59:28.761
WONDERING IN YOUR INITIAL

01:59:28.828 --> 01:59:30.429
JUDGMENT I THINK IN MY INITIAL

01:59:30.496 --> 01:59:31.998
JUDGMENT YOU KNOW THE THE

01:59:32.064 --> 01:59:34.567
MARKETS ARE VERY NERVOUS ABOUT.

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:37.103
THE KIND OF RISK REWARD PROFILE

01:59:37.169 --> 01:59:39.805
OF CALIFORNIA UTILITIES.

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:43.943
AND PART OF THE PART OF THE JOB

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:47.013
OF THE COMMISSION IS TO PROTECT

01:59:47.079 --> 01:59:49.282
RATE PAYERS FROM THOSE IMPACTS

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:52.018
AS BEST WE CAN TO SAY YES.

01:59:52.084 --> 01:59:52.919
YES.

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:55.354
WE DO ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT

01:59:55.421 --> 01:59:57.156
COST INCREASES IF IF THINGS

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:58.791
CONTINUE LIKE I THINK WHEN WHEN

01:59:58.858 --> 01:59:59.625
YOU ADD THE COSTOF THE

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:00.726
WILDFIRES THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:00:00.793 --> 02:00:02.261
HAPPENED IF THOSE END UP BEING

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:03.829
H. A TRIP YOU KNOW PAID FOR BY

02:00:03.896 --> 02:00:05.698
RATE PAYERS. TO THE COST OF THE

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:06.899
WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS AS

02:00:06.966 --> 02:00:08.834
PROPOSED AND CURRENTLY BEING CAN

02:00:08.901 --> 02:00:09.835
YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTED BY THE

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:12.071
UTILITIES. TO THE COST OF

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:14.073
INCREASED COSTS OF EQUITY AND

02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:14.607
DEBT.

02:00:14.674 --> 02:00:15.541
THEY'RE LIKELY TO BE HIGHER

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:17.443
COSTS FOR ELECTRICITY REPAIRS IN

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:18.844
CALIFORNIA MOVING FORWARD.

02:00:18.911 --> 02:00:20.613
AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.181
STATUS QUO UNDER THE UNDER THE

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:23.883
CURRENT SCENARIO SO WITHOUT

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:25.151
LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

02:00:25.217 --> 02:00:26.419
THIS YEAR DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING

02:00:26.485 --> 02:00:27.720
THAT.

02:00:27.787 --> 02:00:29.288
THIS ONE TO MAKE TWO OTHER

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:31.857
POINTS AND ONE THAT REGARDLESS

02:00:31.924 --> 02:00:33.092
OF ACOSTA SOCIALLY WITH

02:00:33.159 --> 02:00:35.161
WILDFIRES THERE ARE PRESSURES ON

02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:37.530
RATES GENERALLY -- DUE TO NEED

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.098
TO REPLACE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE --

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:41.033
AND SO THE STATUS QUO ALSO

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:42.702
INCLUDES THOSE INVESTMENTS.

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:43.970
AND THEN THE SECOND JUST TO MAKE

02:00:44.036 --> 02:00:45.771
THE GENERAL POINT ABOUT THE ROLE

02:00:45.838 --> 02:00:48.107
OF REPAIRS VERSES INVESTORS RATE

02:00:48.174 --> 02:00:49.675
PAYERS DO YOU PAY FOR THESE

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:51.444
INVESTMENTS BUT THEY PAY OVER A

02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:53.212
VERY LONG TIME HORIZON.

02:00:53.279 --> 02:00:54.780
SO WHEN THE UTILITY IS APPROVED

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:56.616
TO GO OUT AND INVEST IN WIRES

02:00:56.682 --> 02:00:58.084
AND POLES THEY HAVE TO GO UT

02:00:58.150 --> 02:00:59.852
AND RAISE THAT MONEY SOMEWHERE

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:01.387
FIRST TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS.

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:02.321
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU GO TO THE

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:05.091
INVESTORS FOR AND SO IF THERE IS

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:07.159
A BELIEF THAT THERE IS MORE RISK --

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:08.327
AND AT RISK OF NOT CAN BE

02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:09.895
MITIGATED IMMEDIATELY ALTHOUGH

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:13.332
IT MIGHT BE OVER TIME THAT WILL

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:14.567
LEAD TO A HIGHER COST OF OUR OWN.

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:15.801
THANK YOU -- CENTER RUBIO

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:16.102
[inaudible]

02:01:16.168 --> 02:01:18.437
THANK YOU.

02:01:18.504 --> 02:01:20.039
THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE -- JUST

02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:22.408
REAL QUICKLY WE KNOW THAT TWENTY

02:01:22.475 --> 02:01:22.975
SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:23.909
WERE YOU KNOW THE HIGHEST COST

02:01:23.976 --> 02:01:25.544
THAT WE HAD IN TERMS OF FIRES.

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:27.880
SO FAR I'M JUST WONDERING --

02:01:27.947 --> 02:01:29.915
SINCE RETRAIN SO MANY PEOPLE I

02:01:29.982 --> 02:01:32.084
TALK ABOUT WE HEARD -- HERE ARE

02:01:32.151 --> 02:01:33.719
NOT GETTING RENEWED -- RIGHT

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:35.821
WHAT TOOLS ARE AT THE INSURERS

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:37.990
DISPOSAL TO AVOID CONCENTRATOR

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:40.993
RISK OTHER THAN JUST COUNSELING

02:01:41.060 --> 02:01:41.727
POLICIES CAN GIVE US

02:01:41.794 --> 02:01:42.028
[inaudible]

02:01:42.094 --> 02:01:45.431
ANY INSIGHT.

02:01:45.498 --> 02:01:47.333
WE HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.735
INSURANCE -- IN COMMISSION

02:01:49.802 --> 02:01:51.270
TESTIMONY THAT.

02:01:51.337 --> 02:01:53.406
RATES ARE INCREASING -- WHAT'S

02:01:53.472 --> 02:01:55.241
CALLED THE WILDFIRE LOADING --

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:58.544
IN UTAH IN INSURANCE RATES IS

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:01.480
INCREASING -- AND IT A NUMBER OF

02:02:01.547 --> 02:02:03.315
VERY LARGE NUMBER OF RATE

02:02:03.382 --> 02:02:05.551
INCREASE FILINGS HAVE HAPPENED

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:07.987
HAVE OCCURRED -- AT THE ENTRANCE

02:02:08.054 --> 02:02:10.456
COMMISSION WHICH INDICATES THAT

02:02:10.523 --> 02:02:13.526
IN ADDITION TO NON RENEWAL --

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:14.493
INTEREST COVERAGE TRYING TO

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.162
PRICE THE INCREASED RISK INTO

02:02:16.228 --> 02:02:18.064
POLICIES.

02:02:18.130 --> 02:02:19.965
WE ALSO HEARD FROM NEW JERSEY

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:21.801
STREET I THINK IN THEIR VIEW AT

02:02:21.867 --> 02:02:23.402
LEAST TO SOME DEGREE THEY CANNOT

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:25.838
FULLY PRICED AT RISK BECAUSE OF

02:02:25.905 --> 02:02:28.107
THE STRUCTURE OF INTEREST

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:30.342
REGULATIONS STATE WE HEARD FROM --

02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:33.612
INSURANCE -- REPAIR ADVOCATES

02:02:33.679 --> 02:02:36.148
THAT -- THAT THAT CLAIM IS IS

02:02:36.215 --> 02:02:37.783
CONTROVERSIAL -- TO SAY THE

02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:38.818
LEAST.

02:02:38.884 --> 02:02:43.155
AND SO BUT BUT THE THE THE MAIN

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:44.657
WAY -- THE OTHERS ARE TWO

02:02:44.724 --> 02:02:48.561
OPTIONS TO STE OUR NON RENEWAL

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:50.629
AS SENATOR MCGUIRE MENTIONED.

02:02:50.696 --> 02:02:53.399
OR PRICING.

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.499
THREE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

02:03:26.565 --> 02:03:27.266
WHETHER IT'S THE LIABILITY COST

02:03:27.333 --> 02:03:28.934

SPECIFIC SINGULAR RECOMMENDATION

02:03:37.977 --> 02:03:40.412
ON EACH ONE OF THESE ISSUES OR

02:03:40.479 --> 02:03:41.947
KIND OF A A SELECTION.

02:03:42.014 --> 02:03:43.415
CHOICE IS THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

02:03:43.482 --> 02:03:45.317

WOULD THINK IT'S THE BEST IN

02:03:49.388 --> 02:03:50.689
LOOKING AT THE INFORMATION THAT

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:51.657
WE JUST SAW.

02:03:51.724 --> 02:03:52.925
EARLIER TRYING TO LOOK AT THE

02:03:52.992 --> 02:03:54.493
LAST FIVE YEARS RICH SCENARIO

02:03:54.560 --> 02:03:55.694
AND WE IF YOU COME UP WITH A

02:03:55.761 --> 02:03:57.263
RECOMMENDATION THAT AS THAT

02:03:57.329 --> 02:03:58.030
MOVES THROUGH OUR LEGISLATIVE

02:03:58.097 --> 02:03:58.998
PROCESS.

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:00.533
IT WILL GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:01.433
TO THAN TWEAK IT IN A WAY THAT

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:03.169
MAKES SOME OF THE NEEDS OF THE

02:04:03.235 --> 02:04:04.970
STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHERS SO WHAT

02:04:05.037 --> 02:04:06.772
IS THE AND THE TIME LINE AND I

02:04:06.839 --> 02:04:10.109
THINK WE KNOW THAT CERTAIN IN

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:12.578
JULY BUT JUNE BUT WHAT WHAT IS A

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:13.612
TIME LINE SPECIFICALLY.

02:04:13.679 --> 02:04:14.880
AND WHAT IS THAT -- ANSWER ON

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:16.182
THAT -- THE ISSUE OF THE TYPE OF

02:04:16.248 --> 02:04:19.151
RECOMMENDATION.

02:04:19.218 --> 02:04:19.718
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:22.721
MEAN OUR SOLE FOCUS AND PURPOSE

02:04:22.788 --> 02:04:25.457
IS TO HELP YOU GET TO A DECISION.

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:27.993
AND SO -- MY ANTICIPATION IS

02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.195
THAT WE WILL MAKE AS MANY

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:30.596
PREFERRED RECOMMENDATIONS AS

02:04:30.663 --> 02:04:32.264
POSSIBLE EVERY RECOMMENDATION

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:34.366
HAS ITS PROS AND CONS SO I THINK

02:04:34.433 --> 02:04:35.701
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL

02:04:35.768 --> 02:04:37.303
YOU WHY RECOMMENDING SOMETHING.

02:04:37.369 --> 02:04:39.138
AND THEN THE PROS AND CONS OF

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:42.775
THAT OF THAT -- EACH ISSUE AREA

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:44.643
THEY ALSO MAY HAVE A A CLEAR

02:04:44.710 --> 02:04:46.312
RECOMMENDATION THAN OTHERS AND

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:48.047
SO WE WILL TRY TO BE.

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:49.248
AS FORTHCOMING AS THOROUGH AS

02:04:49.315 --> 02:04:50.850
POSSIBLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:51.483
THERE'S DISAGREEMENT AMONGST THE

02:04:51.550 --> 02:04:52.818
COMMISSIONERS AND WHERE THERE'S

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:54.119
CONSENSUS.

02:04:54.186 --> 02:04:54.987
I MEAN I THINK THE MAIN THING

02:04:55.054 --> 02:04:57.189
THAT OUR PROCESS HAS BEEN ABLE

02:04:57.256 --> 02:04:57.890
TO BRING TO THIS DIALOGUE IS

02:04:57.957 --> 02:05:00.025
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HEAR

02:05:00.092 --> 02:05:02.194
FROM INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:03.529
AND DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS.

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:04.730
THEIR SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:06.232
IDEAS WE'VE HAD THAT FORUM GOING

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:08.934
ON FOR THE LAST FOUR MONTHS A

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:10.035
FORM THAT'S OCCURRED AFTER THE

02:05:10.102 --> 02:05:11.403
P. GINNY BANKRUPTCY AFTER THE

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:13.939
CAMPFIRE AND SO THOSE TWO EVENTS

02:05:14.006 --> 02:05:16.342
I THINK HAVE -- FOCUSED THE

02:05:16.408 --> 02:05:17.977
ATTENTION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND

02:05:18.043 --> 02:05:18.544
WE'RE GOING TO BRING THAT

02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:20.446
TESTIMONY INTO ANY

02:05:20.512 --> 02:05:24.250
RECOMMENDATIONS WE OFFER TO YOU.

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:26.318
THANK YOU SIR -- CASKEY.

02:05:26.385 --> 02:05:27.586
WHEN WE CONTINUE ON THE FUNDS --

02:05:27.653 --> 02:05:29.388
BECAUSE AS I SEE IT IF WE HAVE.

02:05:29.455 --> 02:05:30.689
THE PRESENTATION WAS FORTY

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:31.790
BILLION WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

02:05:31.857 --> 02:05:33.759
OUT WHAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE

02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:35.494
FUND WOULD LOOK LIKE IF THAT'S

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:36.462
GOOD FOR YOU.

02:05:36.528 --> 02:05:37.529
ONCE AGAIN IN THE SPIRIT OF

02:05:37.596 --> 02:05:39.765
SPREADING NAY THE THE THE RISK

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:41.533
OUT TO DIFFERENT FOLKS AS I SEE

02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:42.534
THE BANKRUPTCY.

02:05:42.601 --> 02:05:44.436
ONCE WE ESTABLISH WHAT THE FUND

02:05:44.503 --> 02:05:47.339
IS THEN WE A PORT.

02:05:47.406 --> 02:05:49.208
PROPORTION WHAT WE THINK P.

02:05:49.275 --> 02:05:50.776
JEANNIE WOULD HAVE TO PAY WHICH

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:53.078
INFORMS THE JUDGE IN THE DEBTOR

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:54.613
IN POSSESSION I'M WHAT.

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.382
THEIR FEASIBILITY OF THEIR PLAN

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:58.517
COSTS THERE'S A DIRECT

02:05:58.584 --> 02:05:59.551
CORRELATION.

02:05:59.618 --> 02:06:00.519
THE RISK I GUESS YOU EVERYBODY

02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:02.588
CONTINUES TO THINK IS WHAT'S THE

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:04.290
RIGHT NUMBER NO WE WE'RE WE'RE

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.557
THE POLICY MAKERS WE GOT TO

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:07.893
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WHAT THE HOW

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:09.228
MUCH WE'RE IN.

02:06:09.295 --> 02:06:11.597
FOR AND HOW MUCH WE THINK IF P.

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.666
JEANNIE HAS 40% IN THE SERVICE

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:15.601
AREA THAN THAT THE UNKNOWN

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:16.368
THAT'S THE REMAINDER I I WOULD

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.003
THINK BUT HELP US OUT HERE

02:06:18.070 --> 02:06:19.939
BECAUSE IT IS THE CUT MY

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:21.674
COLLEAGUE FROM THE THE GREAT SAN

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.175
FERNANDO VALLEY WAS.

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:24.977
WAS -- CONCERNED WE'VE GOT WHERE

02:06:25.044 --> 02:06:26.879
THEIR TIME PRESSURES IS ARE YOU

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:28.714
AND WE'RE TRYING TO KNOW IS

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.816
FORTY BILLION IN THE BALLPARK

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:33.519
AND WHAT ARE THE RISKS.

02:06:33.585 --> 02:06:36.121
IF WERE TOO LOW.

02:06:36.188 --> 02:06:37.489
START WITH AN ANSWER BUT A

02:06:37.556 --> 02:06:38.691
DOCTOR WAR HAS LOOKED AT THESE

02:06:38.757 --> 02:06:40.259
ISSUES EXTENSIVELY SAUSAL WILL

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:41.760
TURN TO HIM.

02:06:41.827 --> 02:06:43.228
AND I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT

02:06:43.295 --> 02:06:45.164
WILD FIRE RISK MODELING IT'S

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:47.700
MUCH LESS MATURE THAN OTHER

02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:49.568
CATASTROPHIC EVENTS THAT THE

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:50.836
COUNTRY HAS DEALT WITH ITS LESS

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:51.904
MATURE THAN EARTHQUAKES AND

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.138
HURRICANES.

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:54.506
AND SO THERE ARE.

02:06:54.573 --> 02:06:57.443
LEGITIMATE MODELS THAT RESULTS

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.845
IN DIFFERENT RESULTS AND ONE OF

02:06:59.912 --> 02:07:00.479
THINGS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TAKE

02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:02.181
TESTIMONY IS ON WHAT THEIR RANGE

02:07:02.247 --> 02:07:04.650
OF MODELS -- IS WHAT YOU HEARD A

02:07:04.717 --> 02:07:05.317
LOT OF MILES ARE STRUCTURED

02:07:05.384 --> 02:07:08.354
AROUND HOW BIG A FIRE CAN THE

02:07:08.420 --> 02:07:11.256
FIND A COMEDY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR

02:07:11.323 --> 02:07:12.224
AND SO THOSE ARE THE PARAMETERS

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:14.927
THAT -- YOU NEED TO ADJUST -- I

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.328
THINK WE WILL GIVE YOU SOME

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:20.199
INSIGHT IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:23.068
REGARDING -- THE OTHER TYPES OF

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:24.536
LIABILITY AND RISK THAT YOU

02:07:24.603 --> 02:07:25.704
WOULD COVER WITH ANY ADDITIONAL

02:07:25.771 --> 02:07:27.039
SIZE FUND.

02:07:27.106 --> 02:07:28.540
BUT I DO THINK AS THE LAST PANEL

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:30.309
MENTION IT ULTIMATELY WILL COME

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:32.478
DOWN TO ALSO SOME POLICY CALLS

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.013
BECAUSE A BIGGER FUN ALSO IS

02:07:34.079 --> 02:07:35.514
MORE COSTLY AND WILL RAISE

02:07:35.581 --> 02:07:37.149
AFFORDABILITY ISSUES WHICH IS AN

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:38.450
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE AND THE

02:07:38.517 --> 02:07:39.952
STRIKE TEAM REPORT AS WELL AS IN

02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:41.453
YOU IN YOUR DELIBERATIONS.

02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:42.921
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN.

02:07:42.988 --> 02:07:45.557
ADD FLESH TO THE BNES OF SOME

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:46.658
OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU.

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:47.793
SAW ON THE STRAIGHT TEAM REPORT

02:07:47.860 --> 02:07:49.495
BUT I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

02:07:49.561 --> 02:07:50.796
THE SCIENCE ITSELF IS SO

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.398
VARIABLE THAT IS TRUE THERE'S

02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:56.435
NOT ONE DEFINITIVE ANSWER.

02:07:56.502 --> 02:07:57.336
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THE THAT

02:07:57.403 --> 02:07:58.670
THE DEBTOR IN POSSESSION IS

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.272
LOOKING FOR A PLAN THAT'S GOING

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:01.340
TO GET NEW MONEY INVESTED INTO

02:08:01.407 --> 02:08:02.374
IT AND IF THEY HAD SOME

02:08:02.441 --> 02:08:03.842
CERTAINTY ON THAT.

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.744
THAT BASED ON THE FUN BUT WHAT

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.246
THE PUT THE PLATE WAS THEN THEY

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:09.248
CAN WORK BACKWARDS WHETHER IT'S

02:08:09.314 --> 02:08:11.050
ENOUGH TO MAKE PEOPLE INVOLVED

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.452
IN IT AND YOU KNOW IN PUT THAT

02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:17.222
NEW MONEY AND THAT'S MY CONCERN.

02:08:17.289 --> 02:08:18.757
I APPRECIATE THAT WHICH IS WHY

02:08:18.824 --> 02:08:20.359
WE WANT TO SUPPORT NUMBER WE

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:21.760
CAN'T COME UP WITH.

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:22.961
A PLAUSIBLE AND LIKELY NUMBERS

02:08:23.028 --> 02:08:24.129
FOR SUCH A FUND BUT I AGREE THAT

02:08:24.196 --> 02:08:25.631
CAN BE AN IMPORTANT INPUT IN THE

02:08:25.697 --> 02:08:27.132
BANKRUPTCY DISCUSSION

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:27.433
[inaudible]

02:08:27.499 --> 02:08:29.535
CENTER HERTZBERG.

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:30.469
YEAH I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:32.037
SENATOR HELMS ARE ACCOUNTS HE'S

02:08:32.104 --> 02:08:35.007
QUESTIONS FIRST YOU SAID ON A

02:08:35.074 --> 02:08:36.208
COMMISSIONER PETERMAN THAT EARLY

02:08:36.275 --> 02:08:38.210
JUNE WHAT IS OUR REGION WE WERE

02:08:38.277 --> 02:08:39.611
DOWN WHERE WOULD THIS IS URGENT

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:41.080
IN OUR JUDGMENT I THINK WE ALL

02:08:41.146 --> 02:08:42.347
SENSE THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:08:42.414 --> 02:08:43.282
HERE TODAY IN.

02:08:43.348 --> 02:08:43.849
THE PRO TEM AND BLOWING HIS

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:45.584
COMMITTEE WHAT IS EARLY JUNE IS

02:08:45.651 --> 02:08:48.287
THAT JUNE THIRD IS THAT JUNE

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:49.088
FIFTEENTH.

02:08:49.154 --> 02:08:50.722
A SO IN TERMS OF THE DRAFT

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:52.424
RECOMMENDATIONS BEING RELEASED

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:53.725
WE'RE TARGETING BY THE END OF

02:08:53.792 --> 02:08:55.594
MAY SO I THINK MAY THIRTY DAYS

02:08:55.661 --> 02:08:57.162
STILL MAYBE THIRTY ONE SO

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:58.530
WHATEVER THAT LAST DAY IS WHAT

02:08:58.597 --> 02:09:00.099
WE'RE TARGETING -- AND THEN WE

02:09:00.165 --> 02:09:01.867
WILL PUBLICLY DISCUSS IT IN THE

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:04.069
FIRST HALF OF JUNE SECOND.

02:09:04.136 --> 02:09:05.771
IS THAT GIVEN THE URGENCY IN THE

02:09:05.838 --> 02:09:07.106
MANAGEMENT OF THE ISSUE GIVEN

02:09:07.172 --> 02:09:09.508
OUR CHALLENGES OUR SCHEDULE IS

02:09:09.575 --> 02:09:12.177
THERE A WAY THAT YOU CAN SEVER

02:09:12.244 --> 02:09:13.178
OFF.

02:09:13.245 --> 02:09:15.114
PRIORITIZE AND SAY OKAY INSTEAD

02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:17.216
OF DELIVERING THE FULL BOOK AT

02:09:17.282 --> 02:09:19.084
ONE TIME JUST AS THE CHAIR OF

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:20.052
THE COMMITTEE SAID LOOK WE

02:09:20.119 --> 02:09:22.321
RICHARD SECTION ONE AND SECTION.

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:23.455
THREE I THINK WE AS A

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:24.823
LEGISLATURE AND ALL BUT BOTH

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.692
HOUSES PRIORITIZE THAT BECAUSE

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:28.360
WE KNOW THE URGENCY OF THIS.

02:09:28.427 --> 02:09:29.561
AND GIVEN THE GOVERNOR'S A

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:31.130
STATEMENT ABOUT THE THE TWELFTH

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:33.565
AND ALL THE PROCESSES WE HAVE TO

02:09:33.632 --> 02:09:34.733
GO THROUGH BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES.

02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:35.901
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S POSSIBLE I

02:09:35.968 --> 02:09:37.102
JUST SHARED WITH YOU IS IT

02:09:37.169 --> 02:09:39.204
POSSIBLY COULD SEVER OFF PIECES

02:09:39.271 --> 02:09:40.205
THE THOUGHT PROVES TO THE GIVING

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:41.406
US THE WHOLE BOOK GIVE US A

02:09:41.473 --> 02:09:42.608
COUPLE OF CHAPTERS.

02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:43.609
THAT YOU'VE THOUGHT THROUGH

02:09:43.675 --> 02:09:45.410
EARLY ON TO YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE

02:09:45.477 --> 02:09:47.980
PROCESS -- THAT ALLOWS US TO GET

02:09:48.046 --> 02:09:49.515
TO WORK EARLIER BECAUSE WE'RE

02:09:49.581 --> 02:09:50.782
SITTING HERE AND SAYING WELL WE

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:52.551
WANT TO EAGLE NINE OH ONE OVER

02:09:52.618 --> 02:09:54.353
HERE MISTER NINE A ONE CREATED

02:09:54.419 --> 02:09:56.221
THIS AND THEN WE NO ONE

02:09:56.288 --> 02:09:57.523
ANTICIPATED THE SITUATION WE'RE

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:59.491
IN NOW SO HOW DO WE TRUNCATE

02:09:59.558 --> 02:10:01.994
THAT. TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW THIS

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.228
LEGISLATURE TO DO ITS WORK

02:10:03.295 --> 02:10:05.631
EARLIER OR RATHER JUST WAITING

02:10:05.697 --> 02:10:08.000
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S THE

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:08.600
FIFTEEN TO WHATEVER IT IS THE

02:10:08.667 --> 02:10:09.835
BUDGET COMES OUT WE GET THE

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:10.936
ASSEMBLY BILLS IN THIS HOUSE

02:10:11.003 --> 02:10:12.638
THEY HAVE OUR BILLS OUR ABILITY

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:13.805
TO GET THIS DONE.

02:10:13.872 --> 02:10:15.774
IS DRAMATICALLY IMPAIRED ANY

02:10:15.841 --> 02:10:17.176
THOUGHTS EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE

02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:18.744
AN ANSWER NOW IF YOU COULD AT

02:10:18.810 --> 02:10:20.212
LEAST TAKE THAT TO HEART.

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:21.880
THE OTHER COUPLE OF POINTS YOU

02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:23.182
JUST QUICKLY WANT TO RAISE.

02:10:23.248 --> 02:10:25.017
IS AGAIN FOLLOWING UP ON CENTER

02:10:25.083 --> 02:10:26.685
HILLS COMMENTS WITH X. REALLY

02:10:26.752 --> 02:10:28.420
IMPORTANT IS A MAKE

02:10:28.487 --> 02:10:30.989
RECOMMENDATIONS RIGHT HE IT'S

02:10:31.056 --> 02:10:32.291
COOL TO TO BE ABLE TO SAY HERE'S

02:10:32.357 --> 02:10:33.592
THE POSITIVE NEGATIVES

02:10:33.659 --> 02:10:34.593
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:36.562
BE IF YOU CAN DRAFT THOSE

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.197
REGULATIONS AND STATUTORY

02:10:38.263 --> 02:10:40.732
LANGUAGE YOU KNOW IN A WAY THAT

02:10:40.799 --> 02:10:42.334
COULD WORK BETTER THAT AGAIN

02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:44.136
TIME TIME IS EVERYTHING IT TAKES

02:10:44.203 --> 02:10:46.705
US A WEEK TO TAKE YOUR DOCUMENT.

02:10:46.772 --> 02:10:52.311
AND THEN TRANSLATED INTO

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:54.980
STATUTORY LINE WHICH GET LOWERS

02:10:55.047 --> 02:10:55.747
TO HELP YOU DO THAT.

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:56.582
TO GIVE US BACK UP PLANS ON THE

02:10:56.648 --> 02:10:57.382
DATA SAID THAT YOU UTILIZING

02:10:57.449 --> 02:10:57.983
WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE WE HAD

02:10:58.050 --> 02:10:59.084
SOME BASIC DOCUMENT WE COULDN'T

02:10:59.151 --> 02:11:01.019
GET ANYTHING BECAUSE THE REASONS

02:11:01.086 --> 02:11:01.954
THAT WERE EXPRESSED.

02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:04.523
SO GIVE US DOCUMENTS THREE IF

02:11:04.590 --> 02:11:06.124
THERE'S A WAY I DON'T KNOW IF

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:07.626
IT'S POSSIBLE LAST POINT.

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:08.594
CAN YOU TALK TO THE RATING

02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:10.529
AGENCIES IN YOUR EXAMINATION

02:11:10.596 --> 02:11:11.830
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'LL TALK TO

02:11:11.897 --> 02:11:13.232
YOU BUT CAN YOU MAKE AN EFFORT

02:11:13.298 --> 02:11:14.600
SO THAT AGAIN.

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.868
PART OF ALL OF THIS IS INFORMED

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.870
BY HOW THE FINANCIAL MARKETS SEE

02:11:18.937 --> 02:11:20.372
THIS IF W COME UP WITH THE PLAN

02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:22.174
BUT THEY DON'T ACCEPT.

02:11:22.241 --> 02:11:23.742
IT MAY BE GREAT FOR US WE ALL

02:11:23.809 --> 02:11:24.843
MAY CELEBRATED BY THE DOZEN

02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:26.378
ACHIEVE THE THE DELIVERABLE OR

02:11:26.445 --> 02:11:28.313
TRYING TO CHEAT IS TO STABILIZE

02:11:28.380 --> 02:11:29.748
THE MISSILE INVESTOR OWNED

02:11:29.815 --> 02:11:31.216
UTILITIES.

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:32.884
IN THIS EARLY THING AND THEN

02:11:32.951 --> 02:11:34.620
LATER OBVIOUSLY WE CAN DEAL WITH

02:11:34.686 --> 02:11:35.220
SOME OF THE OTHER REGULATORY

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.955
PIECES BUT THE POINT THE CHAIR

02:11:37.022 --> 02:11:37.489
MADE.

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:39.891
IN STRESSING WHAT HE DID IN THE

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:40.826
OPENING WAS LET'S FOCUS ON

02:11:40.892 --> 02:11:42.261
LIABILITY IN THE MITIGATION

02:11:42.327 --> 02:11:43.762
PIECES BECAUSE A MITIGATION

02:11:43.829 --> 02:11:45.297
PIECE INFORMS THE WITH THE RISK

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:47.299
PROFILE IS ULTIMATELY DOWN THE

02:11:47.366 --> 02:11:47.733
LINE.

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:50.202
AND I THINK WHAT WAS TESTIFIED

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:50.802
TO HERE'S IT'S GONNA TAKE IS

02:11:50.869 --> 02:11:53.105
EIGHT YEARS THAT MITIGATION PLAN

02:11:53.171 --> 02:11:54.172
TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE

02:11:54.239 --> 02:11:56.074
IMPLEMENTED THE WAY THAT HAS A

02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:57.576
BROAD ENOUGH IMPACTS SO.

02:11:57.643 --> 02:11:59.411
HELPING US GET THERE AS EARLY AS

02:11:59.478 --> 02:12:01.880
POSSIBLE IN FORMING THE PROCESS.

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:02.748
RATHER THAN WAITING FOR THIS

02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:07.986
LINEAL APPROACH COULD BE

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:09.588
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I THINK.

02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:10.355
CENTER HERTZBERG AGAIN I

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:10.989
APPRECIATE THE URGENCY OF TIMING

02:12:11.056 --> 02:12:11.790
AS YOU KNOW THIS COMMISSION HAS

02:12:11.857 --> 02:12:13.759
HAD RELATIVELY VERY LITTLE TIME

02:12:13.825 --> 02:12:14.893
TO CONVENE A DELIVER

02:12:14.960 --> 02:12:16.495
RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE ONLY BEEN.

02:12:16.561 --> 02:12:18.530
INFORMATION -- AN ACTIVE SINCE

02:12:18.597 --> 02:12:21.700
FEBRUARY -- REGARDING A TO MAKE

02:12:21.767 --> 02:12:22.701
ONE COMMENT ABOUT THE RATING

02:12:22.768 --> 02:12:24.436
AGENCIES WHICH UNDERSTANDABLY

02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:26.271
GIVEN THEIR ROLE I THINK THEY

02:12:26.338 --> 02:12:27.706
ARE.

02:12:27.773 --> 02:12:30.075
CAUTIOUS AND FRANKLY NOT WILLING

02:12:30.142 --> 02:12:31.643
TO SAY WHAT WILL CHANGE THEIR

02:12:31.710 --> 02:12:34.579
VIEW -- THEY SPEAK THROUGH THEIR

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:35.781
PUBLISHED REPORTS AND THEY'RE

02:12:35.847 --> 02:12:38.150
PUBLISHED REPORTS HAVE EXPRESSED.

02:12:38.216 --> 02:12:41.219
THEIR SINCERE CONCERN FOR AT

02:12:41.286 --> 02:12:42.888
HEALTH OF CALIFORNIA TO LADIES

02:12:42.954 --> 02:12:45.357
IN TERMS OF PROVIDING YOU.

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:46.425
INPUT IN MORE OF A PIECEMEAL

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:48.827
FASHION ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS

02:12:48.894 --> 02:12:49.461
FROM THE INPUT WE'VE GOTTEN SO

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:51.330
FAR IS THAT THE THREE ISSUES

02:12:51.396 --> 02:12:52.764
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT A

02:12:52.831 --> 02:12:54.566
FUNDAMENTALLY INTER RELATED --

02:12:54.633 --> 02:12:56.535
YEAH THE SUCCESS OR LACK OF

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:57.502
SUCCESS OF A FUND IS SOMEWHAT

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:59.271
TIED TO HOW YOU THINK ABOUT

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:00.906
LIABILITY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:03.208
THE INSURANCE MARKET -- SO I

02:13:03.275 --> 02:13:04.776
WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE RELEASING.

02:13:04.843 --> 02:13:06.678
DIFFERENT PARTS ALSO GIVEN A AS

02:13:06.745 --> 02:13:09.114
A BODY -- WE WILL JUST IT'LL BE

02:13:09.181 --> 02:13:11.283
A STAFF REPORT AND THEN WE WILL

02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:12.584
MEET TO COMPETE.

02:13:12.651 --> 02:13:14.152
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO GATHER --

02:13:14.219 --> 02:13:15.687
BUT WE WILL PROVIDE YOU WHAT WE

02:13:15.754 --> 02:13:19.391
CAN IN A TIMELY MANNER AS

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:20.926
POSSIBLE.

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:21.993
AND WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE YOUR

02:13:22.060 --> 02:13:24.529
VOLUNTEER SALARIES THE JURY FOR

02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:27.032
DOING ALL THIS HEAVY LIFTING

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:28.834
BLESS YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT --

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.402
THE CITY CENTER MCGUIRE THAT

02:13:30.469 --> 02:13:33.638
SENATOR JACKSON CENTER RUBIO.

02:13:33.705 --> 02:13:35.107
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TO CHEER

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.675
ON MAKE THIS FOR THE QUICK -- TO

02:13:36.742 --> 02:13:38.477
BOTH USE THE LAST THING FIRE

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.412
SURVIVORS. ONE HEARS THAT

02:13:40.479 --> 02:13:41.880
THEY'RE GONNA BE EXPECTED TO BE

02:13:41.947 --> 02:13:43.849
ABLE TO PAY INTO WHETHER IT'S A

02:13:43.915 --> 02:13:45.550
A RATE STABILITY ACCOUNT.

02:13:45.617 --> 02:13:48.387
OR VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND IF

02:13:48.453 --> 02:13:50.122
YOU WILL.

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:52.858
SO BESIDES A A LUMP SUM PAYMENT

02:13:52.924 --> 02:13:55.327
FROM FOR EXAMPLE P. JEANNIE.

02:13:55.394 --> 02:13:57.062
IS THERE A FORMULA THAT WOULD

02:13:57.129 --> 02:13:59.264
ALLOW ONE ON GOING.

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:00.832
DEDICATED SOURCE FROM

02:14:00.899 --> 02:14:03.335
SHAREHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP

02:14:03.402 --> 02:14:04.770
ESTABLISH THAT.

02:14:04.836 --> 02:14:06.872
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OR A

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:08.273
COMPENSATION FUND IN YOUR

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:13.512
THOUGHTS ON THAT.

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:14.679
I THINK THAT YEAH COMMISSIONER

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:16.748
AT WARREN ARE WORKING ON THE

02:14:16.815 --> 02:14:18.717
IDEA OF WHETHER FIND IS WORTH

02:14:18.784 --> 02:14:20.786
RECOMMENDING OR NOT AND WE SHARE

02:14:20.852 --> 02:14:22.621
THE STRIKE TEAM VIEW THAT THE

02:14:22.687 --> 02:14:23.622
MORE STAKEHOLDERS THAT

02:14:23.688 --> 02:14:24.956
CONTRIBUTE TO FIND THE BETTER.

02:14:25.023 --> 02:14:28.360
AND SO WE ARE EXPLORING WHAT OUR

02:14:28.427 --> 02:14:30.162
DIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS OF THAT.

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:31.329
I'M NOT PREPARED TO SAY ANYTHING

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:33.064
FOR THE EXACTLY HOW YOU WOULD GO

02:14:33.131 --> 02:14:33.799
ABOUT DOING THAT CONTRIBUTION

02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:35.100
BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF

02:14:35.167 --> 02:14:36.635
QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US

02:14:36.701 --> 02:14:38.403
WHICH IS STRUCTURALLY HOW DO YOU

02:14:38.470 --> 02:14:39.838
MOVE FROM SAYING THAT.

02:14:39.905 --> 02:14:40.705
EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE SOME SKIN

02:14:40.772 --> 02:14:42.140
IN THE GAME TO PRACTICALLY

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:43.842
ENSURING THAT BECAUSE YOU DON'T

02:14:43.909 --> 02:14:45.143
WANT TO STAND UP OF FUN THAT IT

02:14:45.210 --> 02:14:46.745
ENDS UP NOT BE EVERY CAPITALIZE

02:14:46.812 --> 02:14:48.013
THE WAY YOU ANTICIPATE INTO

02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:49.147
SOMETHING MORE OFFENSIVE THAN

02:14:49.214 --> 02:14:50.182
ASKING THOSE.

02:14:50.248 --> 02:14:51.950
WHO JUST LOST THEIR HOME TO BE

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:53.118
ABLE TO PAY INTO FUNDS TO BE

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:54.920
ABLE TO HELP PROP UP UTILITIES

02:14:54.986 --> 02:14:55.654
THAT?

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:58.690
POTENTIALLY COULD BE AT FAULT --

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.392
FOR THAT FIRE THAT DESTROYED

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:01.726
THEIR HOME AS WELL.

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:03.128
SO I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE SO

02:15:03.195 --> 02:15:04.663
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE

02:15:04.729 --> 02:15:06.331
TAKING A LOOK AT AS FAR AS IN

02:15:06.398 --> 02:15:07.265
NOT AT ALL DOING THE DEEP DIVE

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:08.533
INTO THE DETAILS.

02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.335
BUT IT'S ON THE TABLE OF LOOKING

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.670
AT HOW SHAREHOLDERS CAN

02:15:11.736 --> 02:15:13.371
CONTRIBUTE I DO BETTER PROP UP

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:15.273

YES THANK YOU.

02:15:21.813 --> 02:15:23.548
OUR TWO TWO POINTS ONE ON THE

02:15:23.615 --> 02:15:27.686
INSURANCE ISSUE -- IF YOU COULD

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:28.587
COME UP WITH SOME

02:15:28.653 --> 02:15:29.821
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVEN'T

02:15:29.888 --> 02:15:31.256
REALLY.

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:32.624
TAKEN A HARD LOOK AT THE

02:15:32.691 --> 02:15:34.793
INSURANCE INDUSTRY WE DO CAP

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.796
THEIR RATES BUT WE DO KNOW THAT

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:38.864
THEY'RE A PARTICULARLY AT THIS

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.765
POINT IN TIME THE PEOPLE WHO

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:43.835
HAVE BEEN IN THE FIRE ZONES.

02:15:43.902 --> 02:15:46.404
ARE ARE BASICALLY BEING -- A

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.807
STRANGLED WHEN IT COMES NOT ONLY

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:50.742
TO TRYING TO REBUILD OR REPAIR

02:15:50.809 --> 02:15:52.777
WHAT'S GOING ON BUT INCREASING

02:15:52.844 --> 02:15:54.513
THE COST OF INSURANCE FOR NON

02:15:54.579 --> 02:15:55.313
RENEWING.

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.215
IT'S IT'S AN EPIDEMIC.

02:15:57.282 --> 02:15:59.017
THAT THEY APPARENTLY SEEM TO BE

02:15:59.084 --> 02:16:01.620
ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH.

02:16:01.686 --> 02:16:02.487
PERHAPS OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN

02:16:02.554 --> 02:16:04.890
DO TO TRY -- TO EITHER

02:16:04.956 --> 02:16:07.926
INCENTIVIZE OR CREATE A CARROT

02:16:07.993 --> 02:16:09.294
AND STICK APPROACH I DON'T KNOW

02:16:09.361 --> 02:16:10.595
THE ANSWER BUT I DO KNOW THAT IS

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:12.564
HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN

02:16:12.631 --> 02:16:14.132
MY COMMUNITY AND IS.

02:16:14.199 --> 02:16:15.867
A CENTER MCGUIRE INDICATED IN

02:16:15.934 --> 02:16:17.102
HIS AS WELL.

02:16:17.168 --> 02:16:19.104
THAT WOULD BE AN ASK -- THE

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:20.705
SECOND ASK IS FOR ME IT'S SO

02:16:20.772 --> 02:16:22.807
FRUSTRATING TO HEAR HOW WE ARE

02:16:22.874 --> 02:16:24.910
SO DEPENDENT ON THESE RATING

02:16:24.976 --> 02:16:26.344
AGENCIES MOST OF WHICH DON'T

02:16:26.411 --> 02:16:28.313
EVEN KNOW WHAT THE GOLDEN GATE

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.915
BRIDGE LOOKS LIKE I MEAN THEY'RE

02:16:29.981 --> 02:16:32.183
ALL BASED IN NEW YORK -- THEY

02:16:32.250 --> 02:16:33.952
ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SYMPATHETIC

02:16:34.019 --> 02:16:35.687
TO CALIFORNIA ARE THERE SOME

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:37.222
OTHER AVENUE SOME OTHER FUNDING

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:39.124
MECHANISMS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:40.125
TO LOOK AT SO WE'RE NOT SO

02:16:40.191 --> 02:16:41.893
BEHOLDEN TO WALL STREET INTO

02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:43.295
THESE.

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.963
ARE A COMPANIES WHO.

02:16:45.030 --> 02:16:46.197
REALLY I DON'T THINK UNDERSTAND

02:16:46.264 --> 02:16:47.899
CALIFORNIA UNDERSTAND OUR

02:16:47.966 --> 02:16:49.534
CIRCUMSTANCE FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:16:49.601 --> 02:16:51.703
WE'RE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF THIS

02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:53.104
HARDENING IN THE PLANNING AND

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:54.706
THE THINNING IN THE THINGS THAT

02:16:54.773 --> 02:16:59.044
WE NEED TO DO. TO REDUCE THE

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.512
THEY'RE NOT AS CATASTROPHIC CAM

02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:01.780
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:02.781
ALL I THINK.

02:17:02.847 --> 02:17:04.282
A PLEDGING TO DO AN ALREADY

02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:06.918
WORKING ON IS OR SOME OTHER SOME

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:09.120
OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO US

02:17:09.187 --> 02:17:10.755
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T KNOW

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:12.524
THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS.

02:17:12.591 --> 02:17:13.858
THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE HOLDING

02:17:13.925 --> 02:17:15.493
THEIR CARDS VERY CLOSE TO THEIR

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.062
THEIR VESTING WON'T TELL US --

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.830
SO WE ARE REALLY AT THEIR MERCY

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.565
IS THERE SOME WAY WE CAN AVOID

02:17:20.632 --> 02:17:23.368
THAT -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA SET

02:17:23.435 --> 02:17:24.936
UP A ROOM FUND DO SOMETHING SO

02:17:25.003 --> 02:17:26.371
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE SO

02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:28.773
DEPENDENT UPON THE VAGARIES IN

02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:31.309
THE WHIMS OF WALL STREET AND AND

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:32.210
THE FOLKS IN THE RATING

02:17:32.277 --> 02:17:34.479
COMPANIES INTERESTED SIR.

02:17:34.546 --> 02:17:36.715
I THINK VERY FRUSTRATING TO THE

02:17:36.781 --> 02:17:37.949
PEOPLE HERE TO THE TO KNOW THAT

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.551
HAVING LOST A HOUSE IN THE

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:41.720
PROCESS OF TRYING TO REBUILD.

02:17:41.786 --> 02:17:42.988
AND THAT'S IT WHERE WE ARE NOW

02:17:43.054 --> 02:17:45.056
IT'S SUCH AS RECOVERY TO REBUILD

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.158
IT'S TAKING FOREVER INSURANCE

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:49.227
COMPANIES AREN'T COMING THROUGH --

02:17:49.294 --> 02:17:50.495
WE WE WONDER WHAT'S GOING TO

02:17:50.562 --> 02:17:51.763
HAPPEN IN TERMS OF DELIVERY OF

02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:53.565
OUR BASIC NEEDS ELECTRICITY

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:55.834
TETRA TO SOMETHING WE CAN DO

02:17:55.900 --> 02:17:58.470
INDEPENDENTLY IS A STATE. TO TRY.

02:17:58.536 --> 02:18:03.208
TO SHORE UP OUR RESOURCES

02:18:03.274 --> 02:18:04.976
WITHOUT HAVING TO RELY UPON

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:07.012
THOSE FOLKS BACK EAST.

02:18:07.078 --> 02:18:07.946
AT ALL ALL FOR TWO POINTS WHICH

02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:08.780
IS WHAT WE HAVE.

02:18:08.847 --> 02:18:10.548
HEARD FROM ACROSS THE FINANCIAL

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:13.551

THE BANKS AND LENDERS BUT ALSO

02:18:15.420 --> 02:18:16.554
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THE

02:18:16.621 --> 02:18:18.056
REINSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT THE

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:20.191
MORE WILDFIRE MEDICATION WE CAN

02:18:20.258 --> 02:18:21.226
CONDUCT.

02:18:21.292 --> 02:18:24.262
AND THAT IS SUCCESSFUL THAT WILL.

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:26.564

GREATER AMOUNTS IN CALIFORNIA --

02:18:29.267 --> 02:18:30.435
AND THEN JUST YOUR BROADER

02:18:30.502 --> 02:18:32.037
QUESTION IT I MEAN I THINK THE

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:34.639
REALITY IS THE UTILITIES BOTH

02:18:34.706 --> 02:18:36.141
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.

02:18:36.207 --> 02:18:37.776
HAVE TO RELY RIGHT NOW IN THE

02:18:37.842 --> 02:18:39.310
FINANCIAL MARKETS TO FUND THE

02:18:39.377 --> 02:18:40.045
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

02:18:40.111 --> 02:18:41.946

KEEP OUR SYSTEM SAFE AND

02:18:42.547 --> 02:18:44.883
RELIABLE -- SO WE DO NEED TO

02:18:44.949 --> 02:18:45.917
CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

02:18:45.984 --> 02:18:47.652
WE'RE LOWERING RISK BUT MY SENSE

02:18:47.719 --> 02:18:49.020
IS THAT IT'S AGAIN IT'S NOT

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:50.555

DEMONSTRATE WERE LESS RISKY --

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:56.261
THEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES

02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:57.595
