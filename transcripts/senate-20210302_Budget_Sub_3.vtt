AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. AND THEN-

00:26:34.826 --> 00:26:36.394
ADDRESSING THE FINAL QUESTION

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:37.862
ON THE AGENDA THINKING ABOUT

00:26:37.929 --> 00:26:39.364
THE LONG TERM ISSUES THAT WE

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:40.932
MIGHT EXPECT TO FACE. AS A

00:26:40.999 --> 00:26:43.868
RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- WE

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:45.870
THINK THAT- THE SEVERAL THINGS

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:47.639
HAVE BEEN HITTING OUR CLIENT

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:49.341
POPULATION HARD ACROSS OUR

00:26:49.407 --> 00:26:51.042
PROGRAMS OF COURSE BUT-

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.243
FOCUSING JUST FOR A MINUTE ON

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:54.112
OUR OLDER ADULTS. PERSONS WITH

00:26:54.179 --> 00:26:56.715
DISABILITIES ALL AND THE ELDER-

00:26:56.781 --> 00:26:58.416
WHO ARE ARE RECEIVING SERVICES

00:26:58.483 --> 00:27:00.552
TO OUR PROGRAM OR WHO MAY HAVE

00:27:00.618 --> 00:27:02.487
BEEN ON THE EDGE OF NEEDING

00:27:02.554 --> 00:27:04.356
THOSE SERVICES AT ONE TIME

00:27:04.422 --> 00:27:06.358
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT

00:27:06.424 --> 00:27:08.059
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:10.762
AFFECT ON THE HOUSING CRISIS

00:27:10.829 --> 00:27:12.097
THE WORSENING ECONOMIC

00:27:12.163 --> 00:27:16.368
SITUATION MAY NOW NEED THOSE

00:27:16.434 --> 00:27:17.035
SERVICES WERE AS THEY WERE.

00:27:17.102 --> 00:27:19.104
STRUGGLING BUT MAKING IT IT

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:21.106
ABLE TO GET BY AND NOW IN NEED

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:23.241
OF OUR SERVICES. WE THINK THAT

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:24.442
THE IN PARTICULAR THE

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:25.977
POPULATIONS OF OLDER ADULTS

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.379
THAT WE SERVE WHAT THAT WE KNOW

00:27:27.445 --> 00:27:28.947
HAVE BEEN GROWING OVER TIME AS

00:27:29.014 --> 00:27:30.915
WELL AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW

00:27:30.982 --> 00:27:31.883
HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HAD

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.152
HEART. WE THINK THAT A NUMBER

00:27:34.219 --> 00:27:36.588
OF A LARGER NUMBER OF THOSE WE

00:27:36.654 --> 00:27:37.155
SERVE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:38.890
WITH HOUSING ISSUES AS WELL AS

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.592
AN INCREASED NEED FOR MORE

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:41.793
SERVICES AND CONNECTIONS TO BE

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.162
MADE RELATED TO FOOD SECURITY

00:27:44.229 --> 00:27:46.331
HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:27:46.398 --> 00:27:47.465
ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AS WE

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:50.268
SPEAK- SO MUCH ATTENTION PAID

00:27:50.335 --> 00:27:52.370
ON. THE TOLL THAT BEHAVIORAL

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.105
HEALTH OF THE TOLL THAT ARE FOR

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:57.208
INTERVENING AND- HOME SCHOOLING

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:59.344
HAVE TAKEN ON CHILDREN NOT

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.312
BEING ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE

00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.381
FIFTEEN I THINK CAN BE TRUE FOR

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:05.050
ELDERS AND PERSONS WITH

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:06.918
DISABILITIES AND VULNERABLE

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.354
ADULTS YOU MAY HAVE HAD

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.923

NOW CAN NO LONGER DO THAT AND

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.596
SO THINKING ABOUT THEM AT THAT

00:28:18.663 --> 00:28:20.698
END OF THE AGE SPECTRUM AND HOW

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:21.966
WE CAN PROVIDE SERVICES AND

00:28:22.033 --> 00:28:23.168
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT

00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:24.402
OUT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:27.939
CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:28.573
PASSED THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE A

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.841

00:28:29.908 --> 00:28:31.076
LATER IN THE AGENDA THAT I JUST

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:33.078
WANNA TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY NOW

00:28:33.144 --> 00:28:35.013
BECAUSE THEY DO FIT INTO THIS

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.614
CATEGORY OF ONGOING NEEDS.

00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.450
FIRST OF ALL ARE EXPOSED- WE

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:40.418
HAVE A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:41.586
SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH ADULT

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.755
PROTECTIVE SERVICES. INCLUDING

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.356
THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:28:45.423 --> 00:28:47.125
A HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:48.660
IS TARGETED DIRECTLY AT OUR

00:28:48.726 --> 00:28:49.994
ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES

00:28:50.061 --> 00:28:52.263
POPULATION. LEAVES ARE INTO THE

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.498
GROWING POPULATION OF OLDER

00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.999
ADULTS ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE AND

00:28:55.066 --> 00:28:56.734
NEGLECT. AND IT WOULD PROVIDE

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:58.536
FOR EARLIER INTERVENTION BY

00:28:58.603 --> 00:29:00.738
LOWERING THE AGE TO SIXTY. THAT

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.273
THESE- OLDER ADULTS CAN BE

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.309
ELIGIBLE FOR A PS THAT WILL

00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:06.211
BRING IT ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH

00:29:06.277 --> 00:29:06.711
OUR OLDER AMERICANS ACT

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.980
PROGRAM. AND ALSO PROVIDING

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:09.881
MORE FUNDING FOR CASE

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:11.282
MANAGEMENT AS YOU HEARD MISS

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.817
RUTLEDGE DAY TYPICALLY OUR

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:15.053
CASES ARE NOT QUITE OPEN AND

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.621
SHUT BUT THEY ARE NOT A LONG

00:29:16.688 --> 00:29:18.523
TERM. CASE MANAGEMENT THIS WAS

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.791
NOT SOMETHING THE PROGRAM HAD

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.826
EVER BEEN FUNDED FOR. SO THE

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:22.927
FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

00:29:22.994 --> 00:29:24.529
WOULD HELP TO GO TOWARD THAT

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:25.830
FOR THOSE NEEDIEST CASES THE

00:29:25.897 --> 00:29:27.065
ONES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:29.100
NEED. A LAST A MORE HANDS ON

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:30.135
CASE MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.369
JUST MAKING REFERRALS TO

00:29:31.436 --> 00:29:34.005
SERVICES. AND THEN RELATIVELY

00:29:34.072 --> 00:29:35.006
QUICKLY CLOSING THE CASE FOR

00:29:35.073 --> 00:29:37.475
THAT BOB THAT. IN ADDITION THE

00:29:37.542 --> 00:29:38.610
HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH IS

00:29:38.676 --> 00:29:39.811
AIMED AT PREVENTING

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:41.646
HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR APS.

00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:43.114
POPULATION WILL EXPIRE THIS

00:29:43.181 --> 00:29:45.817
JUNE. IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.285
AND WE'VE HAD SUCCESS AT

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:50.021
ENSURING THAT OUR ELDERS AND

00:29:50.088 --> 00:29:51.656
DEPENDENT ADULTS DO NOT BECOME

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.124
HOMELESS WITH THE PROGRAM. WHAT

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:55.026
WE LEARNED- OVER THE PAST

00:29:55.093 --> 00:29:56.327
SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT OUR AGING

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:58.563
POPULATION IN PARTICULAR IS THE

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.064
FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE

00:30:00.131 --> 00:30:01.933
HOMELESS POPULATION. AND THE

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.701
VAST VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE

00:30:03.768 --> 00:30:05.170
INDIVIDUALS HAD NEVER BEEN

00:30:05.236 --> 00:30:06.838
HOMELESS BEFORE SO THEY'RE

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:08.039
ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT ARE

00:30:08.106 --> 00:30:09.941
CAUSING THEM TO BE HOMELESSNESS

00:30:10.008 --> 00:30:11.409
SO AT HOME STATE. DOES THAT

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.178
COME TO OUR ATTENTION FOR APS

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:18.750
WE'VE BEEN ABLE. TO HELP HER-

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:19.851
REMAIN HOUSE. SO WE'D LIKE TO

00:30:19.918 --> 00:30:21.553
BILL OFF THE- SIX IN BOTH MAKE

00:30:21.619 --> 00:30:22.554
IT PERMANENT AND EXPAND IT TO

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:26.324
ADDITIONAL. AND THEN- FINALLY

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:27.292
HAD TO WE HAVE A PROPOSED ALSO

00:30:27.358 --> 00:30:29.060
NOTED ON LATER ON IN THE- FOR

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:30.929
FUNDING. BUT WOULD YOU CAN. TO

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.664
ALLOW AND BILL ON THE ELECTRON

00:30:32.730 --> 00:30:35.099
FORMS THE MISSION THAT- M. AS

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:37.569
TOM. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:38.436
HAVE APPRECIATED DURING A

00:30:38.503 --> 00:30:40.171
PANDEMIC. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:30:40.238 --> 00:30:43.007
FORMS THAT BOTH ARE RECIPIENTS

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:44.509
AS LAWS ARE PROVIDERS OF HIGH

00:30:44.576 --> 00:30:46.010
JUST THAT. NEED TO FILL OUT

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:48.046
EITHER INITIALLY OR AT TIMES ON

00:30:48.112 --> 00:30:50.515
AN ONGOING BASIS. AND WE WERE

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.550
QUESTIONED FUNDING ALONG WITH

00:30:52.617 --> 00:30:54.452
THAT- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.954
PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. TO BE ABLE

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:57.488
TO AUTOMATE THOSE FORMS TO THE

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:59.190
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.692
ALLOW BOTH RECIPIENTS AND

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.060
PROVIDERS JUST SUBMIT THOSE

00:31:02.126 --> 00:31:04.195
FORMS ELECTRONICALLY. WE THINK

00:31:04.262 --> 00:31:04.696
THAT'S REALLY WILL TAKE

00:31:04.762 --> 00:31:06.030
ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.999
EFFICIENCIES BUT ALSO AVOID

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:09.434
UNNECESSARY FACE TO FACE

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:11.502
INTERACTION. WHICH IS GOING TO

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:12.470
CONTINUE WAITING TO BE A

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:14.739
CONCERN FOR SOME TIME EVEN AS

00:31:14.806 --> 00:31:15.974
WE YEAH I'M INCREASE

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.842
VACCINATION. WE SAW QUITE KNOW

00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:19.444
WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER IT'S

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.179
GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO GET BACK

00:31:21.246 --> 00:31:22.614
TO WHATEVER A NEW NORMAL LIVES

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.682
AND SO TRYING TO BUILD OFF THE

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:25.650
SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.785
SHORTER TERM FLEXIBILITIES AND

00:31:27.852 --> 00:31:29.921
CONTINUAL. ADULT ON THIS ONE

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:30.722
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WHAT'S

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:32.190
THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:36.761
QUESTIONS. AS THE PANELS

00:31:36.828 --> 00:31:37.629
COMPLETED THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:39.597
VERY. THE IF WE CAN TO- MISTER

00:31:39.664 --> 00:31:45.436
CLAY CAN. THANK YOU I THINK

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:48.206
YOU'RE MUSICALLY AREA I AM

00:31:48.273 --> 00:31:51.709
EXCUSE ME FOR THAT. HAPPENS SO

00:31:51.776 --> 00:31:53.011
THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE

00:31:53.077 --> 00:31:54.979
GREATLY APPRECIATE IT- IN TERMS

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:56.814
OF THE THREE QUESTIONS I HAVE

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.683
THE FIRST ONE WAS COVERED QUITE

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.351
WELL BY KIM A QUITE WAY I'M

00:32:00.418 --> 00:32:02.854
DIRECTOR WAY I DID A GREAT JOB

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.189
DESCRIBING HOW TRIPLE A STEP IF

00:32:05.256 --> 00:32:07.258
IT'D IN PROVIDING SERVICES. ARE

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:09.260
FAIRLY INTUITIVE THAT YOU KNOW

00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:11.529
SERVICES BECOME REMOTE RATHER

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:13.364
THAN FACE TO FACE AND I

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:15.266
SOMETIMES IT'S MORE EFFICIENT

00:32:15.333 --> 00:32:16.834
AND OTHER TIMES IT CREATES

00:32:16.901 --> 00:32:18.136
UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.570
ESPECIALLY AROUND ISSUES

00:32:19.637 --> 00:32:22.707
AROUND. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT OR-

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:25.243
LEGAL SERVICES OR- JUST OTHER

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.944
WAYS WHERE THAT FACE TO FACE

00:32:27.011 --> 00:32:28.846
CONNECTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:32:28.913 --> 00:32:30.615
I'M ONE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:33.384
IS THE SHIFT TO ALL MEALS BEING

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:35.687
HOME DELIVERED I CREATED SOME

00:32:35.753 --> 00:32:37.221
UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES BESIDES

00:32:37.288 --> 00:32:39.257
THE OBVIOUS ONES I'M ONE OF

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:40.958
THEM WAS HOW DO YOU SERVE

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:42.627
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:44.629
GOING TO CONGREGATE SITES TO

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:46.397
RECEIVE THEIR MEALS. THEY HAVE

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:48.366
NO HOME TO DELIVER THE MEALS TO

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.501
SO- WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:52.670
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS- CONTACTING

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:53.971
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WAS PART OF

00:32:54.038 --> 00:32:55.673
THE TRICKY PART BUT YOU KNOW

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:57.175
JUST FIGURING OUT A CENTRAL

00:32:57.241 --> 00:32:58.743
MEETING PLACE TO DROP OFF THE

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.311
MEALS FOR THEM AND THEN ALSO

00:33:00.378 --> 00:33:02.080
CHANGING THE CONTENT OF THE

00:33:02.146 --> 00:33:04.482
MEALS TO BE SHELF STABLE. SO WE

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:05.983
DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.784
TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED

00:33:06.851 --> 00:33:09.220
REFRIGERATION- SO YOU KNOW

00:33:09.287 --> 00:33:10.355
THAT'S KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.723
THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:13.157
WERE LOOKING AT THE BIG

00:33:13.224 --> 00:33:15.526
SURPRISES I THINK WERE THE

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.662
INCREASE IN DEMAND. OUR WE KNEW

00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:19.263
THERE WAS A LOT THERE BUT

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.365
PROBABLY EVEN GREATER THAN

00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:22.767
ANTICIPATED AND I THINK THE

00:33:22.834 --> 00:33:24.969
OTHER PIECE IS THAT VULNERABLE

00:33:25.036 --> 00:33:27.372
SENIORS PREVIOUSLY VULNERABLE

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:29.607
SENIORS BECAME MORE VULNERABLE

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.975
THAN EVER SO THEY WERE KIND OF

00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:33.277
HIT EXPONENTIALLY HARD- THAT'S

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.545
TRADITIONALLY THE HARDER TO

00:33:34.612 --> 00:33:36.180
REACH HER MORE ISOLATED

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.249
INDIVIDUALS TO BEGIN WITH SO

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.984
HOW DO WE STAY CONNECTED IN

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:44.622
PROVIDE. SERVICES. ON SOME OF

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.592
THE- IT ALSO IS. THE

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:50.428
INFRASTRUCTURE OR LACK OF BATS.

00:33:50.495 --> 00:33:52.563
AND UNTIL THIS COMMITTEE

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.298
STARTED TAKING THE LEAD AND

00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.834
ADDRESSING THE GAP IN SERVICES.

00:33:56.901 --> 00:33:58.603
SENIOR PROGRAMS WERE MOSTLY

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:01.038
IGNORED ON BOTH THE FEDERAL AND

00:34:01.105 --> 00:34:05.443
STATE LEVEL SINCE SWEAT

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.043
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE NINETEEN

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:09.447
NINETY. SO WE HAD TWENTY FIVE

00:34:09.514 --> 00:34:10.448
THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO CATCH UP

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:13.117
ON WHERE PROGRAMS WERE

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:15.520
UNFORTUNATELY FOCUSING AS THEY

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:16.821
SHOULD HAVE ON THE DELIVERY OF

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.523
SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE OF IT.

00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:21.626
BUT NOT DOING REGULAR REPAIRS

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:25.096
OR EXPANSION TO. INFRASTRUCTURE

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:26.564
TO COLD STORAGE TO KITCHEN

00:34:26.631 --> 00:34:29.333
CAPABILITIES ARE VEHICLES WERE

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.135
CONSTANTLY ARE EXCEEDING THEIR

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:33.971
USEFUL. LIFESPAN ARE EXPECTED

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:36.808
LIFESPAN SO WE HAD NOT ONLY

00:34:36.874 --> 00:34:39.544
THIS HUGE INCREASE IN DEMAND

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:41.813
BUT ALSO A CRUMBLING SYSTEM BY

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.515
WHICH TO PROVIDE IT. SO I THINK

00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:46.818
THAT IS- SOMETHING TO KEEP IN

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:48.453
MIND HOPEFULLY MASTER PLAN FOR

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.688
AGING. AND ARE SOME OF THE

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.323
BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.592
CONSIDERED TODAY ARE PART OF

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:56.627
THE APPROACH OF RECOGNIZING

00:34:56.694 --> 00:35:01.265
THAT THIS POPULATION HAS GROWN.

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:12.977
WAY FASTER THAN. WHO. GROUP.

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:14.245
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GROWING

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:17.715
OLDER. I'M SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE

00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:19.417
DO TO PREVENT THAT AND MOVE IT

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:21.185
FORWARD ESTACION SEES LIKE

00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:23.254
REMOTE SERVICE THEM SIGNIFICANT

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:24.856
ASKING YOU I DON'T REMEMBER

00:35:24.922 --> 00:35:25.623
WHAT YOU SAID A COUPLE MINUTES

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.392
AGO BUT WE LOST YOU FOR MAYBE A

00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:31.329
MINUTE OR TWO. I'M SORRY SIR

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.631
SO. I'M I WAS REALLY TRYING TO

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.733
FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.169
HOW FLAT FUNDING FOR SEVERAL

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.838
DECADES. HAS LEFT US WITH

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:43.541
CRUMBLING SERVICES SO WHEN AN

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:45.276
INCREASED DEMAND COMES IF YOU

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:48.379
DON'T HAVE UPDATED KITCHENS OR

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:50.481
IF YOU HAVE OLD VEHICLES. THAT

00:35:50.548 --> 00:35:51.949
CREATES A CRISIS AND SERVICE

00:35:52.016 --> 00:35:53.751
DELIVERY AND I'M ASSUMING I'M

00:35:53.818 --> 00:35:54.919
COMING THROUGH OKAY NOW YES YOU

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:58.389
ARE. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW THE

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:00.658
CHALLENGE OF HOW WE RESPOND TO

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:03.694
THIS WAS KIND OF. DOUBLED BY

00:36:03.761 --> 00:36:05.930
THIS NEW CHALLENGER G. WE HAVE

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.465
TO SAY WE HAVE TO STORE TWICE

00:36:07.532 --> 00:36:08.866
AS MANY MEALS AS WE USED TO

00:36:08.933 --> 00:36:10.735
TWICE AS MUCH FRUIT THERE ISN'T

00:36:10.801 --> 00:36:12.403
CAPACITY DID YOU TO DOTHAT

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:13.404
WERE HAVING TO RENT

00:36:13.471 --> 00:36:15.373
REFRIGERATORS RENT FREEZERS ON

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:16.874
A SHORT TERM BASIS IT JUST

00:36:16.941 --> 00:36:18.776
MEANS THAT. AND THEN SHORTAGE

00:36:18.843 --> 00:36:22.413
OF JUST FOOD AVAILABILITY OR

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.047
OTHER SUPPLIES HAS BEEN PART OF

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:25.750
IT TOO. SO SOME OF THE YOU KNOW

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:26.851
GREAT THINGS IS LEARNING HOW TO

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:27.985
DO SERVICES IN A DIFFERENT

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:29.887
MANNER AND MORE REMOTELY BUT

00:36:29.954 --> 00:36:31.255
WITH THAT COMES ITS OWN SET OF

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:33.591
CHALLENGE- AGAIN THE ALREADY

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.326
ISOLATED FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE

00:36:35.393 --> 00:36:37.295
HIT HARDER. BECAUSE A LOT OF

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.196
THEM DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS OR

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:42.199
TABLETS TO CONNECT WITH. AND

00:36:42.266 --> 00:36:44.635
EVEN ADVANCE PROVIDED THERE'S

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:46.671
TWO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT FALL

00:36:46.737 --> 00:36:48.973
INTO THAT ONE IS AFFORDING YOUR

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:50.975
MONTHLY INTERNET CONNECTION. TO

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.210
IS IF YOU LIVE IN A WERE. IN A

00:36:53.277 --> 00:36:55.212
REMOTE AREA YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE%

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:58.482
ACCESS TO STABLE INTERNET. I'M

00:36:58.549 --> 00:36:59.784
PERSONALLY I HAD TO GET A

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.986
SATELLITE DISH CAPS STABLE

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:04.255
INTERNET IN MY HOUSE LUCKILY I

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:07.091
CAN AFFORD THAT. NOT EVERYBODY

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:10.361
CAN. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:12.363
OF THAT CONNECTIVITY IS JUST

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.031
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO USE

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:16.133
THE TECHNOLOGY. SO REALLY

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.135
BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS

00:37:18.202 --> 00:37:19.870
THREE PIECES IT'S NOT JUST.

00:37:19.937 --> 00:37:21.505
HAVING THE DEVICE BUT IT'S ALSO

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.373
HAVING THE INTERNET

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.475
CONNECTIVITY AVAILABLE AND

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:27.979
HAVING IT AFFORDABLE. AND MAN

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:28.980
PROBABLY MORE THAN THE OTHER

00:37:29.046 --> 00:37:34.418
TWO. AS KNOWING HOW TO USE IT.

00:37:34.485 --> 00:37:37.888
THE OTHER SURPRISE WE HAD AND

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:38.489
IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BUT IT

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:42.259
WAS. AND THAT WAS THE IMPACT ON

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:45.696
OUR WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY THE

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:48.299
VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE SO MANY

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:50.601
OLDER ADULT PROGRAMS ARE DRIVEN

00:37:50.668 --> 00:37:53.270
BY A CADRE OF VOLUNTEERS

00:37:53.337 --> 00:37:56.173
INCLUDING VOLUNTEERS PERFORMING

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.942
AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL WE

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.210
HAVE VOLUNTEERS DOING TAX

00:37:59.276 --> 00:38:01.879
ASSISTANCE WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS

00:38:01.946 --> 00:38:04.215
IN SINGLE SENIOR LEGAL PROGRAMS

00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:06.651
WE HAVE A VOLUNTEERS. ARE DOING

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:08.185
NURSING HOME PROTECTION

00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:10.888
VOLUNTEERS EXPLAINING HOW

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:13.057
MEDICARE WORKS SO THOSE ARE

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:14.725
JUST CASUAL PEOPLE THAT CAN

00:38:14.792 --> 00:38:16.127
LEARN HOW TO DO THEIR JOB AND

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.395
YOU KNOW HALF AN HOUR OF

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:19.630
TRAINING IT'S EXTENSIVE ONGOING

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:22.333
TRAINING AND THAT. IS A GREAT

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.901
WAY FOR OLDER ADULTS THE STAND

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.469
GATES WITH THE COMMUNITY BUT

00:38:25.536 --> 00:38:27.071
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE OLDER

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.606
ADULTS ARE ALSO BEING TOLD

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:30.341
ISOLATE WE NOW HAVE THIS

00:38:30.408 --> 00:38:32.710
VOLUNTEER CORE COMPONENT OF

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.112
PROVIDING SERVICES. OUT OF THE

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:37.948
PICTURE. INCREASED DEMAND LOSS

00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:39.050
OF WORK FORCE INCLUDING

00:38:39.116 --> 00:38:41.085
VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE SO THAT'S

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:43.154
BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE- IT'S

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.088
ALSO A PLACE WHERE I THINK WE

00:38:44.155 --> 00:38:46.190
SHOULD PUT ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.225
IN THE COMING YEAR OR YEARS IS

00:38:48.292 --> 00:38:49.760
TRYING TO LEVERAGE THOSE

00:38:49.827 --> 00:38:50.895
VOLUNTEERS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE

00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:53.798
WAY AND MANNER. AND LOOKING AT

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:56.033
THAT AS A COMPONENT FOR HOW ALL

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.902
OF OUR SERVICES ARE STRUCTURED

00:38:57.968 --> 00:39:01.639
AND FORWARD. I'M TO KIND OF

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:04.775
WRAP IT UP I THINK. THE PARTING

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.210
COMMENT TO MAKE IS HAVING THE

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:11.515
FLEXIBILITY WE CURRENTLY. FOR

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:13.250
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.218
ADMINISTRATION ON AGING

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:16.287
FEDERALLY OR ALLOWING THEM TO

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:18.589
PROVIDE ENHANCED- BUT ALSO WE

00:39:18.656 --> 00:39:20.291
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INCREDIBLE

00:39:20.357 --> 00:39:22.359
QUANTITY OF NEED THAT WE HAVE

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:23.761
AND THEN IS THE SECOND PART OF

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:24.829
THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT

00:39:24.895 --> 00:39:27.798
MEET- SERVICES ARE MUCH MORE

00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:29.734
COMPLICATED THAN EVER IN TERMS

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.602
OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:34.305
IN OUR ROLE- IS FAR BEYOND YOU

00:39:34.371 --> 00:39:35.639
KNOW JUST DETERMINING IF

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:36.741
SOMEBODY'S ELIGIBLE ONES

00:39:36.807 --> 00:39:38.509
ACTUALLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO

00:39:38.576 --> 00:39:40.711

QUALIFICATIONS. I'M HOPEFUL

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:47.451
THAT MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WILL

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:49.086
SERVE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN WHERE

00:39:49.153 --> 00:39:50.588
THE SHORTAGES ARE AND WHAT WE

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.990

00:42:51.835 --> 00:42:53.437
UTILIZATION OF EMERGENCY BACK

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:55.205
UP ACROSS THE STATE IS LOWER

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:57.174
THAN EXPECTED. ANECDOTAL

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.842
INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT MANY

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.311
CONSUMERS DO NOT WANT A

00:43:00.377 --> 00:43:02.680
STRANGER PROVIDING CARE AND

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:03.447
THAT FAMILY OR FRIENDS HAVE

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:05.649
FILLED IN. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:07.518
NEEDED AND USE OUR EMERGENCY

00:43:07.584 --> 00:43:09.186
BACKUP SYSTEMS IT HAS BEEN

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.921
ESSENTIAL AND SOMETIMES LIKE

00:43:10.988 --> 00:43:12.790
SICK. OUR MERCHANTS THE BACKUP

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:14.124
SERVICES HAVE PREVENTED

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:16.093
UNWANTED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.529
AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SOME

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:20.464
OF OUR CONSUMERS. IN TERMS OF

00:43:20.531 --> 00:43:22.366
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS POST COBIT

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:23.901
WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:43:23.968 --> 00:43:25.069
MASTER PLAN ON AGING WHICH

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:27.604
RECOMMENDS INCREASING STABILITY

00:43:27.671 --> 00:43:29.640
R. I. HSS RECIPIENTS. THROUGH A

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:31.408
BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM AND WE

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:32.876
ARE DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL TO

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.445
ADDRESS THIS GOAL IN

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.346
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:37.581
ADMINISTRATION CONSUMER GROUPS

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.450
UNIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:40.818
WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY COUNTY

00:43:40.884 --> 00:43:42.219
SHOULD HAVE AN EMERGENCY BACKUP

00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.787
SYSTEM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY

00:43:43.854 --> 00:43:45.789
THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY TO AUGMENT

OUR RECORDS REGISTRY SERVICES.

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.661
COURSE RECRUITMENT WILL BE A

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:52.262
REALLY BIG FOCUS THERE HAS TO

00:43:52.329 --> 00:43:55.132
BE A WAGE DIFFERENTIAL AND

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:56.900
PERHAPS A MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT.

00:43:56.967 --> 00:43:58.268
IT MAKES SENSE TO DEVELOP A

00:43:58.335 --> 00:44:00.371
CONTINUAL APPROACH ADMINISTERED

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:01.438
BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:02.906
COORDINATION WITH COUNTIES

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:05.242
WHERE CONTRACT AGENCIES COULD

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.810
PROVIDE SERVICES IN SOME

00:44:06.877 --> 00:44:09.346
SITUATIONS. IT KEEPS CONSUMERS

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:10.714
AT THE CENTER AND GIVES THEM A

00:44:10.781 --> 00:44:12.850
CONTINUUM OF CHOICE AND OPTIONS

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:15.052

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:18.822
THAT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:20.557
RESPONDED TO MAINTAIN IT HAS A

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.459

THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.512
OFFICE AND JUST A FEW THINGS

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:43.347
THAT WE WENT TO ELEVATE THAT

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.382
WAS DISCUSSED- WITH THE PANEL

00:44:45.449 --> 00:44:47.184
AND HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR AGENDA

00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:49.019
QUESTIONS IS THAT WE DO AGREE

00:44:49.086 --> 00:44:51.021
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:51.889
TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:52.689
INFORMATION FROM THE

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.691

00:44:54.758 --> 00:44:56.660
KEEPING- PROGRAM BOOKS

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:58.529
ABILITIES ARE CHANGES LIKE THE

00:44:58.595 --> 00:45:00.197
I JUST AS BACKUP PROVIDER

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:03.000
SYSTEM- OR REMOTE TO SEE BASS

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:05.035
AND K. COMMUNITY BASED ADULT

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:08.505
SERVICES- AB THAT WERE PUT IN

00:45:08.572 --> 00:45:10.474
PLACE DURING COALBED THE MERITS

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:12.376
OF CONTINUING THOSE AFTER KOPET

00:45:12.443 --> 00:45:13.777
AND WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:16.146
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES- ALSO

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.515
AS DISCUSSED BY PANELISTS-

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:20.851
WHILE THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN

00:45:20.918 --> 00:45:22.252
INCREASED SERVICE LEVELS DURING

00:45:22.319 --> 00:45:25.055
KOBE IT FOR MANY PROGRAMS AND

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:26.623
THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.959
GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE HAS- AS

00:45:29.026 --> 00:45:30.461
FANS HOPE TO DRESS THOSE

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:32.496
INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS OR

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.398
INCREASED AS SERVICE NEEDS

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:35.732
HOWEVER IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:37.267
SHARE OF THE INCREASE SERVICE

00:45:37.334 --> 00:45:40.504
NEEDS- ARE TRULY TEMPORARY-

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.072
VERSUS WHAT SHARE WILL ACTUALLY

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:45.008
CONTINUE PAST COPING NINETEEN

00:45:45.075 --> 00:45:46.143
I'M SO TO BETTER ASSIST THE

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.711
LEGISLATURE IN DETERMINING WHAT

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:49.346
THOSE ONGOING FUTURE SERVICE

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.715
LEVELS MAY LOOK LIKE AND THE

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.617
LONG TERM EFFECTS COLD IT MAY

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:56.053
HAVE ON THE STATE PROGRAMS-

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.387
PERHAPS REQUESTING ADDITIONAL

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:58.922
INFORMATION FROM THE

00:45:58.989 --> 00:46:02.059
ADMINISTRATION ON- HOW. IS

00:46:02.126 --> 00:46:04.561
SERVICE LEVELS- WILL EITHER

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:07.030
RANKED DOWN POST COLD VENT AND

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:08.232
SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF

00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:10.467
WHAT THE NORMAL NEW STATE WILL

00:46:10.534 --> 00:46:12.603
BE LIKE- AND TAKE THAT INTO

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.371
ACCOUNT AND COMPARED TO WHAT

00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:15.372
FUTURE FUNDING LEVELS WOULD

00:46:15.439 --> 00:46:17.174
LOOK LIKE ONCE THE TEMPORARY

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:23.780
FUNDING FROM. THE FEDERAL

00:46:23.847 --> 00:46:25.149
GOVERNMENT RAMPS DOWN. GRADIENT

00:46:25.215 --> 00:46:26.350
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK I

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:27.518
WOULD I WOULD IF WE COULD

00:46:27.584 --> 00:46:28.685
ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THOSE

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.354
QUESTIONS WHAT DO WE THINK IT

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:31.255
SOUNDS LIKE ACROSS LIKE

00:46:31.321 --> 00:46:32.923
EVERYONE I HEARD FROM SAID THAT

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.857
THEY WANT THE ELECTRONIC

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.559
SIGNING UP. I'M SO MANY MORE

00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:36.994
VIRTUAL VISIT WHAT ELSE DO YOU

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.562
THINK WILL WANT TO KEEP AND

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:41.965
MAINTAIN- AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:49.139
HOPEFULLY BEHIND US. I GUESS

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:52.843
IT'S BACK TO THE- BEIJING OUR

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:56.046
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES.

00:46:56.113 --> 00:46:57.281
SURE I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY

00:46:57.347 --> 00:46:58.615
RIGHT- CHAIR THIS IS CHEMICALLY

00:46:58.682 --> 00:47:00.584
WAY TO THE DIRECTOR OF AGING IS

00:47:00.651 --> 00:47:02.686
THAT I DO THINK THERE IS I

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:04.021
THINK ACTUALLY GOES BOTH WAYS

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:06.323
BUT THERE'S A RECOGNITION- OF

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.158
THE VALUE OF HYBRID SERVICES SO

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:10.360
FOR EXAMPLE- IN ADULT DAY CARE

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:11.762
WHERE A PERSON MAY BE RECEIVING

00:47:11.828 --> 00:47:13.463
TWO OR THREE DAYS OF IN CENTER

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:14.898
FULL DAY SERVICE COULD THOSE

00:47:14.965 --> 00:47:16.500
OTHER TWO DAYS TO GET A VIRTUAL

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:18.302
CHECK OR SOME OTHER CHECK AND

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:19.503
OF COURSE IT COMES DOWN TO

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.038
CANNOT BE A PAID SERVICE UNIT

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.306
HOW YOU APPROPRIATELY TO.

00:47:22.372 --> 00:47:24.675
ENSURE QUALITY AND-

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.043
EFFECTIVENESS BUT THAT WOULD

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:28.478
ALLOW US TO EXPAND BOTH THE

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:29.780
AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO AN

00:47:29.846 --> 00:47:31.148
INDIVIDUAL AS LIKELY COUNTS

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:33.750
MENTION IT ALSO ALLOWS PERHAPS

00:47:33.817 --> 00:47:34.451
TO SERVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.253
SAME PHYSICAL CONSTRAINT RIGHT

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.654
IF YOU'RE ON A GIVEN DAY YOU'RE

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.089
BUILDING CAP MAYBE A HUNDRED

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:39.623
PEOPLE THAT MAYBE YOU'RE

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.325
CALLING FIFTY MORE SO COULD BE

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:43.927
A WAY TO- GROW SERVICES TO MORE

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.796
PEOPLE AS WELL I THINK THAT'S-

00:47:45.862 --> 00:47:47.297
REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK

00:47:47.364 --> 00:47:48.999
ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALIZED-

00:47:49.066 --> 00:47:50.801
IS REALLY BEING CLEAR ABOUT THE

00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:52.669
DISSERVICE MIX SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:55.405
IN THE MEAL DELIVERY- PROGRAMS

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:57.207
THE HOME DELIVERY. BUT IT'S

00:47:57.274 --> 00:47:58.141
MORE THAN A MALE BUT THERE'S A

00:47:58.208 --> 00:47:59.610
MEAL COMPONENT AND THERE'S ALSO

00:47:59.676 --> 00:48:01.478
A SOCIAL ISOLATION COMPONENT IN

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:03.046
AND TALKING TO THE PERSON

00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:04.348
HAVING AN EYE TO EYE CONTACT

00:48:04.414 --> 00:48:05.549
CHECKING THE MAIL THOSE KINDS

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:06.950
OF THINGS ONLY HAPPEN WHEN YOU

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:09.052
HAVE THAT THAT PERSONAL CONTACT

00:48:09.119 --> 00:48:10.854
OR HAPPENED DEEPER SHOULD SAY

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:12.623
AND SO HOW DO WE VALUE ON BOTH

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.391
THE MEAL AND THE ISOLATION

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.993
CHECK THAT HAPPENS IN THAT

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:17.527
PERSON CONTACT WE GIVE IT ITS

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.896
FULL WORK. SO THOSE ARE TWO OF

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.431
THE EXAMPLES FOR US AND I THINK

00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:22.499
YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THE

00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:24.768
TECHNOLOGY FOR VIRTUAL TO BE

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.370
POSSIBLE IF YOU WERE DOING A

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:27.104
VIRTUAL CHECK IN WITH THE

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:28.905
CONSUMER THEN THEY NEED THE

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.240
DEVICE BROADBAND AND THE

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:32.376
SUPPORT TO MAKE THAT CONNECTIVE

00:48:32.442 --> 00:48:33.944
ITTY POSSIBLE I KNOW ALL OF US

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.512
CAN RELATE TO THAT. SO I THINK

00:48:35.579 --> 00:48:37.047
THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT TOO IS

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:38.382
THE PERMISSION STRUCTURE IN THE

00:48:38.448 --> 00:48:39.716
PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE BUT

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:41.251
THEN THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:42.653
TO DELIVER QUALITY VIRTUAL

00:48:42.719 --> 00:48:50.127
SERVICES IMPORTANT. TO BE

00:48:50.193 --> 00:48:50.761
ALLOWABLE PAIN AS WELL. THE YOU

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.062
VERY MUCH. THE YOU HAVE YOUR

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:54.131
HAND UP. MICHAEL YEAH THANK YOU

00:48:54.197 --> 00:48:55.132
I LOVE TO BUILD THAT'LL- BIT

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:58.602
AND THANK YOU FOR- THIS. TO

00:48:58.669 --> 00:48:59.770
FRESH THE INNER. HAS SOMETHING

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:00.637
THAT ARM AND- HAVE BEEN NOTICE

00:49:00.704 --> 00:49:02.139
AS WELL. I WAS REMISS IN NOT

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.240
MENTIONING IT EARLY. SO I'M

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:05.475
REALLY GLAD DIRECTOR MCCOY WADE.

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:07.044
IT ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.145
AREAS BUT ALSO IN A MORE

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:10.547
POPULATED AREAS. THE INTERNET

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.516
SERVICE CAN BE SKETCHY. AND

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:15.052
BROADBAND- CAN BE EXTREMELY

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:16.153
EXPENSIVE IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:18.789
AREA. AND NOT THAT RELIABLE.

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.525
AND SO WERE SUPPORTING EFFORTS

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:23.760
TO TRY TO POINT. ADDITIONAL

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:25.929
INFRASTRUCTURE. FINANCING IN

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:27.731
THE PLACE OR JUST GETTING DOWN

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.333
INTO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.001
TO THEIR HOME. TO ENSURE THAT

00:49:31.068 --> 00:49:32.235
THEY HAVE INTERNET ACCESS

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.670
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. SOMETHING

00:49:33.737 --> 00:49:37.708
OUR MEMBERS ARE DEFINITELY.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:18.734
BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:19.268

BOTTOM LINE THAT IS VERY SHORT

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:42.258
ANSWER IS THAT- 5% PER YEAR. 5%

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:19.421
CHUNK OF SPENDING ON MEDICARE

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.657
ALL IT ACTUALLY GOES TO AGAIN-

01:09:21.724 --> 01:09:24.760
NO INSTITUTIONAL CARE. RIGHT

01:09:24.827 --> 01:09:27.129
SO- YEAH WHEN THINGS WERE

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:28.497
TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE MASTER

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.866
PLAN GOT STARTED AND- WOULD BE

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:33.369
INTERESTED IS THE QUESTION- THE

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.471
ANSWER TO THIS SO WE'VE BEEN

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.473
EXPLORING THIS IDEA OF SAYING

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:40.509
THAT. WE NEED TO. FIND A WAY TO

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.745
FINANCE LONG TERM SERVICES

01:09:42.811 --> 01:09:44.480
SUPPORTS NOT JUST THROUGH THE

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:46.615
MEDICAID PROGRAM SO BASICALLY

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.717
THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT.

01:09:48.784 --> 01:09:50.286
YOUR FAMILY YOU BASICALLY SPEND

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.887
DOWN UNTIL YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR

01:09:51.954 --> 01:09:53.122
MEDICAID THEN YOU END UP ON

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:54.690
MEDICAID AND THEN YOU GET YOUR-

01:09:54.757 --> 01:09:56.458
SERVICES THAT WAY. THAT THERE'S

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:58.060
GOT TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.761
PARTICULAR FROM MIDDLE CLASS

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:03.632
FAMILIES. AND- SO IN RELATION

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.301
TO THE MASTER PLAN- AND SO

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.037
FORTH THAT THAT IS THAT

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:09.405
SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE MASTER

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:13.108
PLAN AND IF SO. WHERE DOES THAT

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.643
SAID SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:10:14.710 --> 01:10:15.544
PIECES AND ALL SORTS OF

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:16.812
DIFFERENT PARTS AND WE HEARD

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:17.580
FROM THE FAR HEALTHCARE

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.547
SERVICES WE'VE HEARD SOME

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.848
THINGS FROM SOCIAL SERVICE AND

01:10:19.915 --> 01:10:20.716
WE HEAR SOME MORE LATER THIS

01:10:20.783 --> 01:10:22.217
HEARING. AND I KNOW THAT THIS

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.352
IS- SO I DON'T KNOW FOR

01:10:23.419 --> 01:10:24.853
DEPARTMENT AGING IS THIS

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.022
SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL UNDER

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:28.891
DEPARTMENT AGING TO DO THIS

01:10:28.958 --> 01:10:30.926
KIND OF ACTUARIAL STUDY OR IS

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.761
THAT SOMETHING THAT. FALLS

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.430
UNDER DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT AND

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:36.498
IS THERE A CHANCE IN THIS-

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:37.600
EVADING DOESN'T KNOW PERHAPS

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:38.934
FINANCE CAN ALSO ADDRESS THIS

01:10:39.001 --> 01:10:41.403
QUESTION AS WELL SO- BECAUSE I

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.072
THINK THIS DEFINITELY AS A

01:10:43.138 --> 01:10:48.243
BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. THAT'S

01:10:48.310 --> 01:10:48.711
THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A

01:10:48.777 --> 01:10:49.411
POTENTIALLY VERY INTACT ON HER.

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:50.579
BUT GOING IN THE FUTURE. IF WE

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:51.213
ARE ABLE TO ACT SUCCESSFUL DO

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.950
THIS. GREAT LET ME TRY TO

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.285
PROVIDE ONE ANSWER TO IT AND

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.087
THEN I WILL TURN MY FINANCE

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.622
COLLEAGUES TO ASSIST SO- AGAIN.

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.123
PERMITTING SUCH A KIND OF I

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.625
MEAN I THINK YOU'RE ASKING BOTH

01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:04.493
A SYSTEM QUESTION AND TO PAY

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.662
YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS YES IT

01:11:06.729 --> 01:11:07.363
MORE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.165
ANSWERS. THAT WOULD YOU THINK.

01:11:10.232 --> 01:11:11.567
I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU YOU ARE

01:11:11.634 --> 01:11:15.804
CORRECT THE LONG TERM SAYS LONG.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:16.972
TERM SYSTEM. ACER THAT P. THAT

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:19.274
WE AS WE- IS. BY MY- PAIRS

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.809
MEDICAID MEDICARE OTHERS

01:11:20.876 --> 01:11:22.411
PRIVATELY BANKS MEDICARE NOT SO

01:11:22.478 --> 01:11:24.079
MUCH BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:11:24.146 --> 01:11:27.316
YES. IN MULTIPLE PROGRAMS

01:11:27.383 --> 01:11:27.816
THROUGHOUT MANY OF OUR

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:30.352
APARTMENTS. SERVICES AGING SO

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:31.754
YOU'RE RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.590
TWO THINGS- THE MASTER PLAN DID

01:11:34.657 --> 01:11:36.091
BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROSS

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:37.426
PROGRAM DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE

01:11:37.493 --> 01:11:39.428
THAT SYSTEM TABLE. AT THE LTSS

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.562
SUB COMMITTEE AND WE ARE

01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:42.297
LOOKING AT WAYS TO CONTINUE

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.833
THAT SYSTEM TABLE- PARTICULARLY

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:45.968
PERHAPS BUILDING ON THE STRONG

01:11:46.035 --> 01:11:47.269
FOUNDATION OF THE OLMSTED

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:48.437
ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT BRINGS

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:49.738
TOGETHER DISABILITY AND AGING

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:50.639
STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT

01:11:50.706 --> 01:11:52.641
COMMUNITY INCLUSION- SO THAT WE

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.476
CAN HAVE A SYSTEM CONVERSATION.

01:11:54.543 --> 01:11:55.678
AND CERTAINLY AGING IS PART OF

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.579
FACILITATING THAT PARTNERSHIP

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:59.481
CONVERSATION. BY TIER ABSOLUTE

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.351
POINT MEDICAID AS A DH CS DHS

01:12:02.418 --> 01:12:04.019
CONTINUES TO BE THE LEAD ON

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.155
THAT ISSUE AND DELETE THE WORK

01:12:06.221 --> 01:12:06.722
WORK WITH MELANIN TO DO THE

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.857
ACTUARIAL STUDY- THE NEW

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:09.992
MEDICARE OFFICE OF INNOVATION

01:12:10.059 --> 01:12:11.627
INTEGRATION IS PROPOSED TO BE

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:15.564
AT DH. CS BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.532
ABSOLUTELY. BOTH MEDICARE. THAT

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.667
EXIST NOW. TO EXPAND MEDICARE'S

01:12:18.734 --> 01:12:20.035
ABILITY TO PAY FOR HOME AND

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.637
COMMUNITY SERVICES. AND

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.038
POTENTIALLY SOME EXCITING

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:23.572
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.674
FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. TO

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:28.811
REVISIT MEDICARE'S ROLE LTSS I

AND THEN TO YOUR POINT THERE IS

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.046
BEYOND. THE STATE INSURANCE

01:12:31.113 --> 01:12:32.214

ISN'T YEAH WE'RE NOT ALKING

01:13:03.912 --> 01:13:05.914
ABOUT. THAT WELL WE'RE NOT

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.382
TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY THE PART

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:09.451
THAT FITS IN MEDIC CAL OR EVEN

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:11.019
THE PART THAT FITS AND MEDICARE

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:12.354
ALTHOUGH DEPENDS AGAIN ON THE

01:13:12.421 --> 01:13:13.155
FEDERAL LEVEL IT CREATES NEW

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.490
OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATCHING

01:13:14.556 --> 01:13:15.157

ADVANTAGE OF THAT. SO BUT JUST

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:19.161
STUDYING THE ISSUE OVER ALL

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.697
BEYOND META CAL RIGHT SO WE

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:22.731
HAVE MEDICARE WE KNOW THAT'S

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.666
THERE BUT FOR PEOPLE. IS THERE

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.201
AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO NOT

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.070
HAVE TO GO ON MEDICARE HOUSE IN

01:13:28.137 --> 01:13:30.072
ORDER TO GET LTSS SERVICES AND

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:31.840
WHAT ARE THEY SO YES THE

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:32.407
INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS

LONG TERM CARE CERTAINLY L. A.

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.750
SURE IT'S ADDRESS- I THINK WE

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.452
NEED TO LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.553
OF COURSE THAT'S PLAYED BY THE

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:45.454
FACT THAT YOU HAVE ADVERSE

01:13:45.521 --> 01:13:47.489
SELECTION OF NEARLY NOT

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:48.824
EVERYONE'S IN AND SO FORTH. IS

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.959
THERE. A SPACE WHERE WE CAN

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:53.095
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:54.229
MAYBE IT IS IN YOUR TELL ME ITS

01:13:54.296 --> 01:13:55.564
DTS THAT'S FINE ENOUGH TO

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:56.932
INTEREST HERE FROM DIED. FROM

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.700
FINANCE. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A

01:13:58.767 --> 01:14:00.435
FIGURE OUT A CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:14:00.502 --> 01:14:02.237
SAYING LOOK HOW COULD WE- HOW

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.372
COULD BE. WE HAVE TO SEVEN YOU

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.340
PROGRAM. RIGHT DAD WHERE

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:06.241
EVERYONE HAS TO BE AND IN THE

01:14:06.308 --> 01:14:07.643
SAME WAY WE ACTUALLY SET UP THE

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.311
RETIREMENT PROGRAM ACTUALLY

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:10.412
THERE TIME SEEMS PROGRAM HERE

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:14.850
AS WELL- THAT. THAT WAS DONE

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:15.551
THAT THAT MAY BE. PART OF THE

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.386
SOLUTION SO. WHERE WOULD THAT

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:20.155
SIX. OUT IN TERMS OF- WOULD

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.224
THAT STILL CERTAIN EIGHT C. S.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:23.826
A. SIM IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.627
NOT SAYING IT'S QUITE AN AGING-

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:28.463
MAYBE FINANCING THOMAS TO

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.064
WHERE'D THAT DISCUSSION SHOULD

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.600
SET. YEAH I DO THINK IT'S A

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:32.467
PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THE

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.069
HEALTHCARE PAYER IT IS A GAP IN

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.304
MEDICARE IT'S ULTIMATELY

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.705
GAPPING MEDICARE IN OUR COUNTRY

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.407
AND SO THAT IS A STARTING PLACE

01:14:38.473 --> 01:14:40.342
BUT INTO THE- YOUR PERSPECTIVE.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:42.611

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:48.510
DETAILS BUT IS THERE FUNDING

01:15:48.577 --> 01:15:49.244
ASSIGNED THE OFFICE TO DO THE

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:54.249
ACT OR- NECESSARY. TO AND IF TO

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:54.883
HELP START DEVELOPING AIDS. TO

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.085
PROVIDE. THE FINANCE LTSS

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:58.887
SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:00.923
COOL HOPEFULLY NOT COULD END UP

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:01.890
IN THE ATTIC CAL I MEAN WE CAN

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:04.126
FORCE THEM INTO EVENTUALLY IF

01:16:04.192 --> 01:16:04.960
THEY SPEND DOWN ENOUGH. BUT

01:16:05.027 --> 01:16:06.862
THAT. BUT BASICALLY LOOKING AT

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:09.331
ALTERNATIVES. TO SPENDING DOWN

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.366
TO MALAKAL IS A WAY TO FINANCE

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:12.367

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.347
WORK NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.150

THE THAT I WAS OF THE SENATE

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.152
OFTEN. ABOUT IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:27:38.219 --> 01:27:40.455

SAY WELL HOW MUCH IS THE COST

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:46.894
WE DON'T DO THAT. RIGHT SO HOW

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:48.096
MUCH IS THE BECAUSE THAT'S IT'S

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:49.097
NOT SO MUCH DO WE SPEND MONEY

01:27:49.163 --> 01:27:50.498
ON THIS. WE JUST DON'T SPEND

01:27:50.565 --> 01:27:51.766

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:52.900
KNOW I HAVE A NUMBER OF.

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:54.636
POSITIONS OR WHATEVER ELSE AND

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:55.303
THAT'S GONNA BE THAT MANY

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.905
DOLLARS. BUT HOW MUCH WE SPEND

01:27:57.972 --> 01:28:01.242
WE DIDN'T HAVE IT. RIGHT AND-

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.610
AND SO IT TURNS OUT WE'RE GONNA

01:28:02.677 --> 01:28:04.379
END UP SPENDING MORE FROM NOT

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.381
HAVING IT. THEN FROM HAVING IT.

01:28:06.447 --> 01:28:07.915
I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE WOULD PUT

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:10.118
IT ON A SUSPENSION LIST OR SOME

01:28:10.184 --> 01:28:12.253
OTHER SITUATION I MEAN. THAT

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:12.854
THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A GOOD

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.623
INVESTMENT. AND SO I HOPE THE

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:16.591
ADMINISTRATION I CERTAINLY

01:28:16.658 --> 01:28:17.592

ELIMINATE THE SUSPENSION

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:31.139

RELATES TO THE 7% RESTORATION

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.536
AGAIN UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:45:09.603 --> 01:45:12.839
BUDGET PROPOSAL AND- HE IS

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:16.109
PROPOSING TO BOTH MAINTAIN AND

01:45:16.176 --> 01:45:19.046
EXTENDED THE- SUSPENSION

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:21.248
LANGUAGE AS IT AS IT RELATES TO

01:45:21.314 --> 01:45:26.787
THE 7% RESTORATION- A- SIMILAR

01:45:26.853 --> 01:45:28.388
TO. THE EIGHTY SEE ISSUE RECKON

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:30.257
OF THE- BRIDGE. THE NEW BUT

01:45:30.323 --> 01:45:34.061
BILL SAYS- AS TREATS. AN

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:35.829
ONGOING I JUST SAYS SERVICE

01:45:35.896 --> 01:45:39.900
COSTS. AS TEMPORARY. SO WHAT

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:41.201
THAT ESSENTIALLY WOULD MEAN

01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:43.637
THEN BY REJECTING THAT IS AGAIN

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:44.705
UNDER CURRENT LAW WE WOULD

01:45:44.771 --> 01:45:47.641
JUST- AND HERE TO THE EXISTING

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:49.276
SUSPENSION LANGUAGE AND THAT

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:50.243
CALCULATION WOULD BE DONE IN

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:52.612
MAY AND AGAIN OUR OFFICE BASED

01:45:52.679 --> 01:45:55.482
OFF OF RECENT REVENUES- IT'S

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:57.517
LIKELY THAT BACK CALCULATION

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:59.052
WOULD SHOW THAT WE DO HAVE

01:45:59.119 --> 01:46:02.155
ENOUGH FUNDS- TO- SUPPORT THE

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:04.825
I. HSS. SUSPENSION IN THE FOR

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:08.161
PAY AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

01:46:08.228 --> 01:46:08.795
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO THEN

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:09.663
THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

01:46:09.730 --> 01:46:11.398
PERMANENTLY RESTORING I JUST US

01:46:11.465 --> 01:46:12.799
HOURS ARE PROVIDING FUNDING

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:15.836
NEEDED TO DO THAT- HE SAID THAT

01:46:15.902 --> 01:46:17.604
THE LEGISLATURE DOES. REJECT

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:20.607
THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE WE ALSO

01:46:20.674 --> 01:46:23.243
SUGGEST CLEANING UP STATUTE-

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:25.245
WHICH CURRENTLY TIES THE

01:46:25.312 --> 01:46:26.113
RESTORATION OF THE SERVICE

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:28.148
HOURS TO THE MANAGED CARE

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:30.217
ORGANIZATION TAX AND THIS

01:46:30.283 --> 01:46:31.551
CLEANUP WOULD AGAIN JUST

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:32.285
FURTHER ENSURE THAT BY

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:34.154
REJECTING THE SUSPENSION

01:46:34.221 --> 01:46:39.059
LANGUAGE THE 7% RESTORATION IS

01:46:39.126 --> 01:46:41.394
MAINTAINED ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

01:46:41.461 --> 01:46:44.164
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YEAH I

01:46:44.231 --> 01:46:45.398

LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.035
INCREASING LIKE WE DO AND TO

01:46:49.102 --> 01:46:51.071
THINK ABOUT. A MEETING SUFFERS

01:46:51.138 --> 01:46:52.305
AND CUTS JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:53.640
MAKE ANY SENSE AND WE'RE NOT

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:54.775
GOING TO SEE THIS POPULATION

01:46:54.841 --> 01:46:57.244
DECREASING I THINK. AS MY

01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:59.012
GENERATION CONTINUES TO- THE

01:46:59.079 --> 01:47:01.148
BOOMERS CONTINUE TO AGE- AND AS

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.649
OUR SOCIETIES CONTINUE TO

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:03.583
CHANGE WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T

01:47:03.650 --> 01:47:04.818
LIVING IN THE SAME NUCLEAR

01:47:04.885 --> 01:47:05.886
LITTLE ENVIRONMENT LIKE THEY

01:47:05.952 --> 01:47:07.487
USED TO BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT.

01:47:07.554 --> 01:47:09.156
MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK MORE

01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:10.690
FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TO WORK.

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:11.958
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY AS A

01:47:12.025 --> 01:47:16.096
MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:17.631

WITH THIS- AS A MEMBER OF THE

01:47:19.332 --> 01:47:20.634
WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE KNOW THAT

01:47:20.700 --> 01:47:22.335
MORE WOMEN END UP. BEING CARE

GIVERS A LOT OF THEIR LIFE AND

01:47:24.171 --> 01:47:25.071
THEN AT THE VERY END OF THEIR

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:27.073
LIFE AND UP ALONE HAND IN

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.775
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES

THEMSELVES WITHOUT. PROPER CARE

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:31.912
AND AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBT

01:47:31.978 --> 01:47:33.747
CAUCUS WE KNOW OUR LGBT

BROTHERS AND SISTERS SPECIALLY.

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:37.350
ON THOSE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE

01:47:37.417 --> 01:47:39.386
EVEN MORE AT RISK OF BEING

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:40.954
ALONE WHEN THEY'RE OLD AND

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:44.825
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT. STAFF TO

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:45.959
MAINTAIN THEM AND AS WAS POINT

01:47:46.026 --> 01:47:48.061
OUT WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IN

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:50.730
OUR- CONGREGATE SETTINGS.

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:51.264
DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHERE

01:47:51.331 --> 01:47:53.266
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES YOU

01:47:53.333 --> 01:47:55.635

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.470
PANDEMIS COME THROUGH AND MORE

01:47:57.537 --> 01:47:59.372
PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND A LOT OF

01:47:59.439 --> 01:47:59.973
THOSE WHO HAVE DIED AS AS I

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.775
THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN. HAVE BEEN

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:03.610
SOME OF THE POOREST AND PEOPLE

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:05.579
OF COLOR AND PEOPLE TO LEAST

01:48:05.645 --> 01:48:07.280
ACCESS SO THAT IS NOT A GOOD

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:08.448
REFLECTION ON US AND WE NEED TO

01:48:08.515 --> 01:48:10.383
CONTINUE TO DO BETTER. AT

01:48:10.450 --> 01:48:13.887
PROVIDING THE SERVICE. OKAY

THANKS VERY MUCH- SO THAT'S THE

01:48:16.122 --> 01:48:17.557
QUESTION FOR FARM SOCIAL

SERVICE AGAIN PRESHEAF YEAR

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.161

THAT- IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:48:23.563 --> 01:48:26.666
PROPOSAL YOUR QUOTE NAT ARE

01:48:26.733 --> 01:48:29.836
SUSPENDING THE 7% CUT FOR TWO

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:32.639
YEARS IS. I REALIZE WE PASS A

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:34.875
BUDGET EACH YEAR BUT- USE THAN

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:36.543
APPLYING THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:39.312
OUT YOUR CALCULATIONS ON YOUR

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:42.349
THREE THERE'S AUTOMATIC 7% CUT.

01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:44.351
THIS IS DEBBIE FINANCING ANSWER

01:48:44.417 --> 01:48:45.819
THAT IF THERE'S A REMOTE CHANCE

01:48:45.886 --> 01:48:49.890
THAT. SYDNEY IF YOU WANT TO

01:48:49.956 --> 01:48:53.326
THAT'S OUR NON. AS OF RIGHT NOW

01:48:53.393 --> 01:48:54.961
THE LANGUAGE STATES THAT ON THE

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.630
SUSPENSION WOULD GO INTO EFFECT

01:48:56.696 --> 01:49:00.000
ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY

01:49:00.066 --> 01:49:00.600
TWENTY TWO OKAY SO THERE IS A

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:03.336
YOUR PLANE CAUGHT. CORRECT OKAY

01:49:03.403 --> 01:49:04.170
SO I THINK- THAT THAT'S

01:49:04.237 --> 01:49:06.039
TROUBLESOME- BE INTERESTING

01:49:06.106 --> 01:49:07.307
DURING THE JUSTIFICATIONS THAT

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:08.575
BUT I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:12.746
AND ACTUALLY- THIS. WELL IT.

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.281
SOUNDS IN FOR DEPARTURE SERVICE

01:49:14.347 --> 01:49:17.217
IT DO YOU CALL THE- U. T. TO

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:18.785
YOU CAREFULLY SAID TRYING TO

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:19.719
CORRECT THIS BY SAYING IT'S NOT

01:49:19.786 --> 01:49:21.254
A COST SAVINGS OF THE COSTA

01:49:21.321 --> 01:49:24.124
WAIT AND SEE. AND I DON'T SPEND

01:49:24.190 --> 01:49:24.958
TOO MUCH TIME PARSING LANGUAGE

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:28.595
BUT- TO ME IT'S STILL A COST

01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:30.463
SAVINGS BECAUSE I MEAN. IT

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:31.865
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

01:49:31.932 --> 01:49:33.767
NOW YOU WEEK WE CAN TRY TO HIDE

01:49:33.833 --> 01:49:35.468
THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS IN THE

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:36.336
NURSING HOME PROGRAM FROM

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.538
PEOPLE MAYBE THEY WON'T SIGN UP

01:49:38.605 --> 01:49:39.339
FOR MEDICARE ONLY FIND OUT

01:49:39.406 --> 01:49:41.775
ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S AN

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:44.978
ENTITLEMENT SO. IF SOMEONE IS

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:49.349
NOT ABLE TO GET THERE. SIR I

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:50.817
HSS SERVICES. YEAH THEY NEED

01:49:50.884 --> 01:49:54.020
THEM NOW NEED TO CARE- WELL

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:54.754
FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK IT'S

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:56.256
GOOD POLICY WE DENY IT TO THEM

01:49:56.323 --> 01:49:57.791
ALL TOGETHER I MEAN THAT'S

01:49:57.857 --> 01:49:59.392
OBVIOUSLY QUOTED POLICY OPTION

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:01.061
ONE THAT I WOULD NOT ACCEPT.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:02.963
BUT AT LEAST FOR RIGHT NOW A AS

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:04.397
I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY UNDER

01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:07.300
CURRENT POLICIES DALY BEAT AND

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:11.571
ABLE TO- GET NURSING HOME CARE.

01:50:11.638 --> 01:50:14.774
IS THAT CORRECT- MY WRONG.

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:16.443
THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:17.110
ANYBODY FROM GETTING NURSING

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:20.113
HOME CARE ALL ALL I WAS REALLY

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.581
TRYING TO SPEAK TO WAS THAT MY

01:50:21.648 --> 01:50:23.416
BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE WE'RE NOT

01:50:23.483 --> 01:50:25.785
MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT COST

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:29.789
SAVINGS- BECAUSE- CALCULATING

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:31.791
COST AVOIDANCE BECOMES MORE

01:50:31.858 --> 01:50:35.729
COMPLEX- OKAY WELL WE- DIDN'T

01:50:35.795 --> 01:50:37.297
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT

01:50:37.364 --> 01:50:39.432
SERVICES INDIVIDUALS CAN ACCESS

01:50:39.499 --> 01:50:41.101
IT. IF YOU TO THE BALLOT THAT

01:50:41.167 --> 01:50:42.502
WAS NOT THE INTENT OKAY ALL

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:44.304
RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL WE DON'T

01:50:44.371 --> 01:50:45.538
LET'S NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME

01:50:45.605 --> 01:50:47.107
PARSING WORDS BUT I KNOW WE HAD

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:48.708
A REPORT PREVIOUSLY SCENARIO

01:50:48.775 --> 01:50:50.610
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SHOW THAT

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.812
ACTUALLY- BUT A CALL COST

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:56.616
AVOIDANCE OR COST SAVINGS THAT

01:50:56.683 --> 01:50:59.619
BASICALLY- WE- YEAH. TO I HSS

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:00.720
AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THE

01:51:00.787 --> 01:51:02.255
CASELOADS GOING UP BECAUSE THE

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:02.922
MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE

01:51:02.989 --> 01:51:05.058
SERVICES. WOULD BE SPENDING

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.693
MORE ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE NOT

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.261
SAYING THAT EVERYONE AND I JUST

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:09.496
AS IF THEY WERE YOU KNOW CAN

01:51:09.562 --> 01:51:10.830
GET IT WOULD END UP IN THE

01:51:10.897 --> 01:51:11.598
SEASONAL CARE BUT A GOOD

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:12.699
PORTION WOULD WHICH IS OF

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:14.534
COURSE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:15.068
THAN ACTUALLY ARE SPENDING

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.403
WOULD GO UP QUITE A BIT. DONE

01:51:16.469 --> 01:51:18.138
SO I JUST WANT TO KEEP THAT IN

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.272
MIND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:51:19.339 --> 01:51:20.907
SUSPENSION. THE OTHER THING IS

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:22.642
THAT I DO APPRECIATE IN THE

01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:25.612
ALLEY- REPORT ON PAGE TEN THE A

01:51:25.678 --> 01:51:27.180
CHART SHOWING STATEWIDE AVERAGE

01:51:27.247 --> 01:51:30.150
IHS US EARLY HOURLY WAGE AND

01:51:30.216 --> 01:51:32.218
HOW IS WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSE. FIND

01:51:32.285 --> 01:51:33.987
OUT BASICALLY THE LINE BETWEEN

01:51:34.054 --> 01:51:35.355
THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE

01:51:35.422 --> 01:51:36.856
STATEWIDE AVERAGE HSS HOURLY

01:51:36.923 --> 01:51:38.691
WAGES SENSUALLY HE ARE ALMOST

01:51:38.758 --> 01:51:41.661
OVERLAPPING- AND I THINK THAT

01:51:41.728 --> 01:51:43.663
TELLS YOU THAT- IN TERMS THE

01:51:43.730 --> 01:51:46.166
AMOUNT OF SPACE YOU KNOW. HOW

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:48.234
MUCH WE'RE PAYING AND IT'S-

01:51:48.301 --> 01:51:50.904
BASICALLY I MEAN. OUR OWN LAWS

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:51.838
ARE REQUIRED REQUIRING THE

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:52.672
WAGES TO GO UP FOR APPROPRIATE

01:51:52.739 --> 01:51:54.307
REASONS AND I PROBABLY VOTED

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:57.644
FOR THOSE LAWS- BUT- IT'S AN

01:51:57.710 --> 01:51:58.611
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT WE CAN

01:51:58.678 --> 01:52:01.014
CUT. WAGES AND WE SHOULD OR

01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:03.083
SHOULD CUT WAGES AND THEN SO

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:05.418
THE QUESTION IS THAT IF WE DO

01:52:05.485 --> 01:52:07.287
THE 7% CUT I GUESS IT'S 7%

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:09.022
HOURS WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:10.957
ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS SO. IF

01:52:11.024 --> 01:52:12.926
SOMEONE ACTUALLY AND I PRESUME

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:13.827
WHEN PEOPLE GET SERVICES

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:15.161
THROUGH I JUST AS WE DO DO AN

01:52:15.228 --> 01:52:17.330
EVALUATION NOW TO EVALUATE

01:52:17.397 --> 01:52:19.165
THAT. THERE NEEDS FOR EIGHTY

01:52:19.232 --> 01:52:20.200
ALSO FOR IT SO WHAT DO WE

01:52:20.266 --> 01:52:22.235
EXPECT TO HAPPEN WHEN IF WE DO

01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:23.870
A 7% CUT I MEAN IT'S GOING TO

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.071
BE S. COTTON HOURS WE CAN'T

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:26.172
LEGALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.507
PASSED THE MINIMUM WAGE

01:52:27.574 --> 01:52:28.975
ACTUALLY CUT THEIR SALARY BY

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:31.177
SEVEN PERCENT- ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:32.612
THE TWO LINES ARE ESSENTIALLY

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:36.649
OVERLAPPING- SO. WHAT DOES WHAT

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.585
DOES THE DEPARTMENT AND AGAIN-

01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:39.819

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:46.426
HAPPEN AND IF WE DO IF AND. IN

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:47.427
TWO YEARS WE DO A 7% CUT. THIS

01:52:47.494 --> 01:52:49.362
PERCENT CUT IS TO AUTHORIZED

01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:51.998
HOURS IT DOESN'T CUT. RIGHT

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:53.833
RIGHT I THINK WHAT THE INTENT

01:52:53.900 --> 01:52:54.968
OF THE PERSON I WAS SPEAKING

01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:56.769
WAS TO SAY THAT IF THERE'S

01:52:56.836 --> 01:52:58.938
FEWER HOURS THE PAY OF THE

01:52:59.005 --> 01:53:01.808
PROVIDER IF THEY DON'T FIND AT

01:53:01.875 --> 01:53:03.243
OTHER NO THAT'S IT OKAY SO I

01:53:03.309 --> 01:53:05.178
GET THAT BUT NOT BUT LET'S JUST

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:07.013
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CLIENT. SO

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.681
THE CLIENT YOU'VE ASSESSED THE

01:53:08.748 --> 01:53:10.216
SAY THEY NEED THEY HAVE THESE

01:53:10.283 --> 01:53:11.117
NEEDS THEY CAN'T FEED

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:14.521
THEMSELVES OR WHATEVER CAN'T BE

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:15.121
THEMSELVES OR BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:17.524
DISABILITY. THEN WE TAKE AWAY.

01:53:17.590 --> 01:53:19.993
YOU KNOW HALF A DAY A DAY HEARD

01:53:20.059 --> 01:53:22.128

DO THEY NOT EAT THOSE DAYS I

01:53:24.497 --> 01:53:30.036
MEAN WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN.

01:53:30.103 --> 01:53:30.904

WANT TO REITERATE HERE WE

01:53:40.046 --> 01:53:41.247
RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE

01:53:41.314 --> 01:53:45.118
SITUATION WE ARE YOU KNOW.

01:53:45.185 --> 01:53:46.553
COMMITTED TO REASSESSING AS WE

FOR OKAY. AND FIRST OF ALL I

APPRECIATE THAT- BUT AS I

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:27.360
POINTED OUT IN OTHER AREAS FOR

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.295
EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE A 7% CUT

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:31.731
ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE BUDGET

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.199
FOR EVERYONE ELSE FOR EXAMPLE

01:54:33.266 --> 01:54:34.500
TRANSPORTATION WE DON'T TELL

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.135
PEOPLE WHO BUILD OUR ROADS.

01:54:36.202 --> 01:54:37.770

01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:52.285
T. PROJECT NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:53.519
GO BACK IN AND RENEGOTIATE

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:54.988
CONTRACT NOW I TELL YOU THE

01:54:55.054 --> 01:54:56.756
ECONOMY IS BADLY IF I WOULD GO

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:58.691
BACK HEY BY THE WAY. NO HE DO

01:54:58.758 --> 01:55:02.128
FERTILITY BROCHURE SHOWING CASH

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.363
BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY. HEALTH

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.697
AND HUMAN SERVICES INCLUDING

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:07.200
THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. WE

01:55:07.267 --> 01:55:09.068
NEED TO TELL PEOPLE. THAT BY

01:55:09.135 --> 01:55:11.804
THE WAY. WE'RE GONNA BUILD THIS

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:13.806
CUT IN AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:15.408
EACH YEAR WE'RE GOING TO GO AND

01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:16.109
SAY WELL YOU DON'T WANNA DO

01:55:16.175 --> 01:55:17.877
THIS YEAR. BUT IT'S STILL GOING

01:55:17.944 --> 01:55:19.379
TO HANG OVER YOU. WERE NOT

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:20.680
GOING TO DO NEXT YEAR BUT IT'S

01:55:20.747 --> 01:55:22.348
GONNA HANG OVER YOU. ESPECIALLY

01:55:22.415 --> 01:55:23.583
SINCE IT'S A CORE SERVICE

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:24.851
TONIGHT THAT THAT'S WHY GOES

01:55:24.917 --> 01:55:26.052
BACK TO MY QUESTION OF WHAT

01:55:26.119 --> 01:55:27.253
WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN

01:55:27.320 --> 01:55:28.588
YOU DECIDE TO PULL THE CAT.

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:30.523
RIGHT WITH- YOU KNOW IT'S THE

01:55:30.590 --> 01:55:31.424
PERSON NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT FOR

01:55:31.491 --> 01:55:33.426
A DAY. IT'S ENOUGH TO GET PAID

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.761
FOR A DAY OR TWO DAYS OR

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:36.129
WHATEVER DEBT REPRESENTS IN

01:55:36.195 --> 01:55:37.997
TERMS OF HOURS. BECAUSE AFTER

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:38.965
ALL DIDN'T END UP IN THE

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:41.868
PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T

01:55:41.934 --> 01:55:43.403
HAVE THOSE NEEDS IN FACT WE

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:45.004
EVEN REQUIRED OR FOR YOU TO.

01:55:45.071 --> 01:55:47.273
GET THE SERVICES THAT. YOU HAVE

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:49.042
TO DEMONSTRATE YOU HAVE YOU DID

01:55:49.108 --> 01:55:50.877
YOU NEED THE SERVICES. I MEAN

01:55:50.943 --> 01:55:52.078
WE DO IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE CAN

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:53.913
JUST SIGN UP FOR IT WITHOUT

01:55:53.980 --> 01:55:55.715
HAVING TO GET AN ASSESSMENT

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:58.885
DONE. AND SO TO ME. IT DOESN'T

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:03.256
MAKE SENSE. TO TAKE A CORE

01:56:03.323 --> 01:56:04.357
PROGRAM. THAT IN BUT WHICH BY

01:56:04.424 --> 01:56:06.092
THE WAY IN THE END COLLECTIVELY

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.527
AND WE DON'T THE CASE BY CASE

01:56:07.593 --> 01:56:08.561
WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:09.896
BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT

01:56:09.962 --> 01:56:10.963
THEY END UP IN INSTITUTIONAL

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:12.899
CARE. FINANCIALLY BECAUSE WE

01:56:12.965 --> 01:56:14.300
PRIDE REALLY COULDN'T STOP

01:56:14.367 --> 01:56:15.735
FEEDING PEOPLE OR STOP IT YOU

01:56:15.802 --> 01:56:17.170
KNOW IT SAID IT. I'LL BE PEOPLE

01:56:17.236 --> 01:56:18.805
SELF. EVENTUALLY NEED TO GO

01:56:18.871 --> 01:56:20.406
SOMEWHERE ELSE. AT LEAST A

01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:23.676
PORTION OF THEM SO. SO THAT'S

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:26.045
TO ME SO AGAIN- THAT'S I THINK

01:56:26.112 --> 01:56:27.747
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND WHY

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:28.681
IS IT ONLY IN HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:56:28.748 --> 01:56:30.583
SERVICES INCLUDING THIS PROGRAM

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:32.285
WHICH IS SO CRITICAL. TO

01:56:32.352 --> 01:56:34.554
PEOPLE'S CARE. THAT WE KEEP

01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:36.589
THIS ESSENTIALLY CUT HOVERING

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:39.392
OVER THEM. RIGHT I MEAN IS THIS

01:56:39.459 --> 01:56:41.127
THIRD YOU YOUR BUDGETING OR.

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:43.129
SO YES THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:44.330
ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING.

01:56:44.397 --> 01:56:46.199
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KEEPING

01:56:46.265 --> 01:56:47.800
THINGS AS YOU KNOW FOR PUTTING

01:56:47.867 --> 01:56:49.402
THE MONEY THERE BUT MAYBE MAYBE

01:56:49.469 --> 01:56:50.136
SHOULD TAKE THAT'S WHAT WE

01:56:50.203 --> 01:56:52.638
SHOULD EXPECT. INSTEAD OF-

01:56:52.705 --> 01:56:54.474
SAYING THAT. BECAUSE WHAT

01:56:54.540 --> 01:56:55.274
YOU'RE SAYING IS TWO YEARS

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:57.009
LATER WE HAVE TO. PRAY THAT IT

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:59.212
WON'T HAPPEN YOU KNOW. AT THAT

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:01.147
POINT IN TIME. AND IS THAT THE

01:57:01.214 --> 01:57:02.181
RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS AFTER WE

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.617
DON'T DO THAT FOR OTHER

01:57:04.684 --> 01:57:06.285
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE. AND

01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:07.220
WE DO THAT FOR OTHER THINGS AND

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.454
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:09.522
NOT FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS WE

01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:10.790
DON'T HAVE A COTTON AND SAID IT

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:13.192
WAS A SPENDING CUT. HIM

01:57:13.259 --> 01:57:15.762
BUILDING A 7% CUT ACROSS. OTHER

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:18.164
DEPARTMENTS. UNLESS I'M WRONG I

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:19.565
MEAN I DON'T KNOW I'VE I'VE-

01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:20.967
CAN'T YOU KNOW I MAINLY DO THE

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:23.136
SUB COMMITTEE BUT I DO PAY

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:23.770
ATTENTION TO THE OTHER PARTS OF

01:57:23.836 --> 01:57:25.805
THE BUDGET. IS THERE AN EXAMPLE

01:57:25.872 --> 01:57:26.439
WHERE THAT'S BEING DONE

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.241
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BUDGET

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:28.741
OUTSIDE HEALTH AND HUMAN

01:57:28.808 --> 01:57:34.213
SERVICES. W. PARTNER FINANCE.

THANK YES ANYTIME OUT APARTMENT

01:57:35.681 --> 01:57:37.850
OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NOTE

01:57:37.917 --> 01:57:38.851
SINCE THE TWENTY NINETEEN

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:39.619
BUDGET ACT THERE HAVE BEEN

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:40.787

AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:43.956
INVESTMENTS THESE PROGRAMS

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:44.891
SINCE THAT'S THE DESTRUCTION A

01:57:44.957 --> 01:57:46.492
BALANCED BUDGET TO SUPPORT ON

01:57:46.559 --> 01:57:48.461
AN ONGOING BASIS SO THE

01:57:48.528 --> 01:57:50.062
SUSPENSION FRAMEWORK IS THE

01:57:50.129 --> 01:57:51.364

ISSUE ONLY WELCOME CONTINUE

01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.271
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

SAID REALLY WHAT IS A REAL

01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:15.455
ALTERNATIVE RIGHT I MEAN OF

AND I KNOW THAT BUT ALSO WHAT

01:58:20.393 --> 01:58:22.161
DOES THAT TRANSLATE INTO- WHAT

01:58:22.228 --> 01:58:23.729
WE DON'T DO IT- THE OTHER

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:29.168
QUESTION I ALSO HAVE IS THAT-

01:58:29.235 --> 01:58:31.804
AGAIN- IS- IT IN THIS. PROPOSED

01:58:31.871 --> 01:58:33.706

ISSUES COME UP AND SO I

01:58:35.074 --> 01:58:36.209
UNDERSTAND CERTAIN THINGS ARE

01:58:36.275 --> 01:58:37.510
EXPIRING FRIDAY JUSTICE IN

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:38.511
TERMS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:58:38.578 --> 01:58:41.948
AGREEMENTS AND SO FORTH- YOU

THERE'S NO LONGER A CALF. BUT

02:00:16.509 --> 02:00:18.144
THE COST OF THE INCREASE IS

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:20.346
SPLIT BETWEEN THE COUNTIES AND

02:00:20.413 --> 02:00:25.284
THE STATE- 65% COUNTY AND 35%

02:00:25.351 --> 02:00:28.020

HAS TO BE ELECTRONICALLY

02:04:23.622 --> 02:04:25.691
CAPTURE. WE CURRENTLY IN OUR

CURRENT SYSTEM DO COLLECT THE

THAT THE REQUIREMENT. SO

02:04:43.375 --> 02:04:45.077
THEREFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE AN

02:04:45.144 --> 02:04:47.213
UPDATE TO THAT SYSTEM WE DID

02:04:47.279 --> 02:04:48.547

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:11.704
PART OF OUR DISCUSSION IN THE

FALL WAS THAT THE STATE MADE

02:05:14.173 --> 02:05:15.574
THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD

02:06:05.591 --> 02:06:08.494
OPTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WHICH

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:10.963

TYPE FUNCTIONALITY CAPTURING-

02:06:19.338 --> 02:06:22.474
LOCATION COORDINATES AT THOSE

AND COME TO DECISIONS ABOUT HOW

02:07:33.412 --> 02:07:35.614
WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. AND

02:07:35.681 --> 02:07:40.953

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:42.287
OF THOSE CHANGES. FROM WHAT WE

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:45.424
ABOUT- ABOUT THESE TYPES OF

KAFR CAPTURING THIS

02:07:47.393 --> 02:07:49.962
INFORMATION- WE DON'T BELIEVE

02:07:50.029 --> 02:07:53.265

WHAT IT WILL TAKE TIME AND BE

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:03.308
VERY CRITICAL IS ENSURING THAT

HOW TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM WITH

02:08:14.353 --> 02:08:16.288
THOSE CHANGES AND SO THAT WOULD

02:08:16.355 --> 02:08:18.524
BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS. OF THE

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:20.359
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHANGES

02:08:20.426 --> 02:08:22.928
ONCE WE DECIDE. WHAT DIRECTION

WE WILL BE GOING SO THAT IS

02:08:25.831 --> 02:08:28.767

OVERTIME HOWEVER WE MUST ALSO

02:27:29.340 --> 02:27:31.142
CAN CURRENTLY PLAN TO BUILD OUT

SEVENTY SEVEN WAS TO SLOW DOWN

02:27:42.153 --> 02:27:44.288
THE PROCESS THE FACILITIES THAT

02:27:44.355 --> 02:27:45.890
SERVE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS.

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:47.425
HAVING TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS DUE

02:27:47.491 --> 02:27:49.293
TO FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY AND

02:27:49.360 --> 02:27:51.562
THEREBY LOSING THE CAPACITY TO

POPULATION. AND AS I MENTIONED

02:27:54.398 --> 02:27:56.467
BEFORE WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT

02:27:56.534 --> 02:27:58.669
TEN FACILITIES ANNUALLY. WILL

02:27:58.736 --> 02:28:00.771
REQUIRE TEMPORARY MANAGERS TO

SUPERVISION DURING OWNERSHIP

02:28:04.475 --> 02:28:06.277
TRANSITION. AND THE THIRD

02:28:06.344 --> 02:28:08.779
QUESTION IS A TEMPORARY MANAGER

02:28:08.846 --> 02:28:11.015

AND IN WHICH SITUATIONS IS A

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:19.357
TEMPORARY MANAGER NECESSARY.

02:28:19.423 --> 02:28:21.359
HOW DOES THIS MODEL WORK WITH

02:28:21.425 --> 02:28:24.195
RCMP. AND THE ANSWER IS NO

02:28:24.262 --> 02:28:30.001
TEMPORARY MANAGERS. THEIR USE

02:28:30.067 --> 02:28:31.335
MOST TYPICALLY WHEN THE

02:28:31.402 --> 02:28:33.170
TEMPORARY SUSPENSION ACTION BY

RELOCATION OF THE RESIDENTS

02:28:38.576 --> 02:28:40.378
IT'S NOT FEASIBLE BASED ON

02:28:40.444 --> 02:28:42.046
THINGS SUCH AS RISK OF TRANSFER

02:28:42.113 --> 02:28:43.848

02:28:53.658 --> 02:28:56.494
RELOCATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC

TEMPORARY MANAGERS HAVE BEEN

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.097
UTILIZED TO TIMES WHEN THE

02:29:00.164 --> 02:29:01.265
ADMINISTRATOR CONSCIOUS

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:03.734

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:07.872
SITUATIONS WHERE THE LICENSEE

02:29:07.938 --> 02:29:09.774
MAY PASS AWAY OR FILE FOR

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.108
BANKRUPTCY THE DEPARTMENT MAY

02:29:11.175 --> 02:29:13.177
APPOINT A TEMPORARY MANAGER TO

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:14.612
ENSURE THE FACILITY CAN

02:29:14.679 --> 02:29:16.847
CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:18.783

MANAGERS AND BOTH ARE AN RCMP

02:29:26.223 --> 02:29:27.124

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:29.060
INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING

02:29:29.126 --> 02:29:31.262

OPEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL

02:29:47.778 --> 02:29:49.046
STRATEGIES THE STATE COULD

02:29:49.113 --> 02:29:50.514
CONSIDER TO ENSURE THE

02:31:52.536 --> 02:31:56.207
REASONS. YES SO I'LL TAKE THE-

02:31:56.273 --> 02:31:59.410
FIRST OF BAD OF INFLUENCE JUST

02:31:59.477 --> 02:32:00.811
FURTHER THAT. CURRENTLY HAVE

02:32:00.878 --> 02:32:02.413
SOME PRETTY. LIMITATION WITH

02:32:02.480 --> 02:32:05.816
OUR- INTO OF UNDERSTANDING OF

WHERE A RESIDENTS TRANSFER AS A

02:32:08.652 --> 02:32:10.421
RESULT A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE

02:32:10.488 --> 02:32:13.624
IS- ANECDOTAL DATA. THAT

02:32:13.691 --> 02:32:15.459

WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE DATA

02:32:21.398 --> 02:32:23.667
AS I REFERENCED IS THAT EVEN

02:32:23.734 --> 02:32:25.736
THOUGH WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF

02:32:25.803 --> 02:32:27.905

RESIDENTS UTILIZING FACILITIES.

02:32:33.911 --> 02:32:36.547
SO WE CURRENTLY ARE INTERESTED

02:32:36.614 --> 02:32:38.115
IN DOING SOME ORGANIC DATA

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:40.451
