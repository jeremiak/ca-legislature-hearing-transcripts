QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR MISTER

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:59.135
GIBSON- I THINK THIS IS A- WELL

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:00.236
THOUGHT OUT A PIECE OF

00:59:00.303 --> 00:59:02.472
LEGISLATION POLICY- I THINK

00:59:02.538 --> 00:59:05.041
THAT AGAIN- WE TALK ABOUT FIFTY

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:07.176
FIVE. THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.444
LOST THEIR LIVES TO THIS

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.246
PANDEMIC AND IT'S ONLY THE TIME

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.615
WHEN THERE'S A PANDEMIC- THEY

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:15.285
WANT TO PROVIDE SOME HELP TO

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:18.154
THOSE TO BURY- INDIVIDUALS- I

00:59:18.221 --> 00:59:19.656
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:20.757
SHOULD BE DOING IT'S MAKING

00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.025
SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:24.260
CARE OF- I KNOW A LOT OF

00:59:24.327 --> 00:59:26.796
PEOPLE- IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:29.499
WHO JUST DIDN'T HAVE MONEY. WHO

00:59:29.565 --> 00:59:31.701
THIS PANDEMIC- HAS TAKEN THEM

00:59:31.768 --> 00:59:33.536
OUT AND THEIR FAMILIES WISH

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:36.639
THEY COULD- BURY THEM BUT THEY

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:38.541
HAD TO DO RESERVE RIVER REVERT

00:59:38.608 --> 00:59:43.379
TO- BEING CREMATED- AND SO I

00:59:43.446 --> 00:59:44.681
THINK THAT IF IN FACT THE

00:59:44.747 --> 00:59:46.683
FAMILY WANTS TO LAY SOMEONE TO

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.051
REST DURING A PANDEMIC WE

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:48.985
SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.887
ASSISTANCE AND I THINK THIS IS

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.355
CERTAINLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:53.356
DIRECTION- HOPE THE AUTHOR

00:59:53.423 --> 00:59:56.592
WOULD. INCLUDE ME AS A CO

00:59:56.659 --> 01:00:00.096
AUTHOR OF THE BILL. YES TENNIS

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:03.933
DAVIS I THINK INTERESTED- I

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.401
WILL BE SUPPORTING BILL I JUST

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.804
HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE CAN

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.340
APPLY FOR THE EXPENSE

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:11.808
ASSISTANCE IS FAMILY FRIENDS.

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.776
AND THE SECOND ONE IS- THIS IS

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.278
FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES OR CAN

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.045
ANYONE APPLY FOR THIS

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.647
ASSISTANCE SORT OF SO THE

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:18.948
PROGRAM WILL BE FOCUSED ON LOW

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:20.383

TEARS WERE LOOKING AT. A

PUBLIC CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IT

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:31.279

AUTHOR. SOMEONE IN CHOI.

01:23:09.818 --> 01:23:11.820
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON I THINK

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.922
I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE INTENT

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:17.092
OF THE APPEAL TO MAKE A MORE

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:20.528
CHILD CARE FACILITIES AVAILABLE

01:23:20.595 --> 01:23:23.131
BECAUSE OF ALWAYS- FROM MY

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:26.000
EXPERIENCE A SHORTAGE OF POOR

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:27.369
CHILD CARE CENTERS. EVEN THOUGH

01:23:27.435 --> 01:23:30.538
INTENT IS GOOD BUT THE- I READ

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:32.574
THAT THE ANALYSIS A VERY

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.044
CAREFULLY AND- I HAVE SEVERAL

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.580
QUESTIONS- SINCE AT THIS BILL

01:23:38.646 --> 01:23:42.917

OF FACILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO

01:23:47.756 --> 01:23:52.193
LEAVE IN THAT HOME. SO THAT IS

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:56.231
SO IF I WAS CO HOMEOWNER-

01:23:56.297 --> 01:24:01.503
OPERATING AND THAT MEANS I CAN-

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:03.738
RAN TEN AS THE HOUSE. TICKETS

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.440
ARE ON OUR OWN LEVY IN THAT

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:10.311
pTHIRD ONE FOURTH ONE. IS THAT

01:24:10.378 --> 01:24:13.381
THE ALLOWABLE RESELLERS YOU ARE

REFERRING AS A SECONDARY I

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:17.652
SINCE NO SIR. SO THE WAY IT

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.921
WOULD WORK IS- AND THIS WOULD

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.556
ALSO ANSWER ONE OF THE

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.858
OPPOSITION COMMENTS IS THERE IS

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:26.194
NO TRANSFER OF LICENSE. THE

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.563
PRIMARY LICENSEE HAS TO BE THE

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:30.832
HOMEOWNER THAT LIVES IN THE

01:24:30.899 --> 01:24:34.002
HOME SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT AND

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:36.137
THIS IS WHERE WE EED TO.

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:37.639
TIGHTEN UP LANGUAGE AND WE'RE

01:24:37.705 --> 01:24:38.807
WORKING WITH LEAD COUNSEL IN

01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:40.642
WITH- WITH OPPOSITION WHO

01:24:40.708 --> 01:24:42.277
STATED THEY WERE WORKING WITH

01:24:42.343 --> 01:24:44.345
US AS WELL AS THIS COMMITTEE-

01:24:44.412 --> 01:24:45.513
BUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT AS

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.449
CORPORATIONS COMING IN IN THE

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.684
NEIGHBORHOODS. AND JUST OPENING

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.653
UP A BUNCH OF DAYCARES UNDER A

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:53.855
CORPORATE NAME SO YOU HAVE TO

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:56.724
BE A PRIME A PRIMARY LICENSEE

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:57.325
HAS TO BE THE RESIDENT OF THE

01:24:57.392 --> 01:25:00.161
HOME. OR OWNER OF THE HOME AND

01:25:00.228 --> 01:25:02.397
A RESIDENT OF THE HOME THE

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.566
DIFFERENCE IS RIGHT NOW IT

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.534
REQUIRES IF- IF YOU'RE A PRIME

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:08.169
IF YOU'RE THE LICENSEE IT

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:10.605
REQUIRES YOU TO BE THERE 80% OF

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:11.606
THE TIME AND ACCORDING TO

01:25:11.673 --> 01:25:13.741
RULES- THAT BAKER CAN ONLY BE

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.276
CLOSED LEGITIMATELY FOR TWO

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:17.479
WEEKS OUT OF THE YEAR. SO WHAT

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.848
THIS DOES IS IT DOES ALLOW A

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:22.250
HOMEOWNER WHO POSSIBLY HAS A

01:25:22.317 --> 01:25:26.654
JOB. BUT THEY HAVE OPEN SPACE.

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:28.256
THE HOME AND THEY POSSIBLY KNOW

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:29.924
SOMEONE THAT'S IN THE CHILD

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:31.292
CARE FIELD WANTS TO ENTER THE

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:33.328
CHILD CARE FOR OF. THAT LIVE

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.262
SOMEWHERE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:36.865
THE SPACE. THAT HOMEOWNER WOULD

01:25:36.931 --> 01:25:39.200
BE THE PRIMARY LICENSEE THEY

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.035
COULD BRING AND THAT PERSON

01:25:41.102 --> 01:25:43.071
THAT USES THEIR HOME DURING THE

01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.973
DAY IS A DAY CARE. BUT THEIR

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.741
LICENSEES A SECONDARY LICENSE

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.676
HE IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIMARY

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:52.180
LICENSEE ALL LIABILITY. ALL ALL

01:25:52.247 --> 01:25:54.449
INSPECTIONS. ALL REGULATORY

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:56.584
POLICY EVERYTHING FALLS ON THE

01:25:56.651 --> 01:25:58.887
PRIMARY LICENSEE WHO LIVES AT

01:25:58.953 --> 01:26:00.655
THE HOME AND WHO OWNS THE

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:02.590
PROPERTY. AND THEN IF THAT'S

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:03.191
THE CASE OF WHAT'S THE

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:07.128
DIFFERENCE A BIT OF BETWEEN. I

01:26:07.195 --> 01:26:09.397
COULDN'T USED THE TERM AS A MY

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:13.134
EMPLOYEE HIRED THAT PERSON.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.103
RATHER THAN SECONDARY PERSON

01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:18.473
HAVING TO SECURE THE LICENSE

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.042
AGAIN RIGHT BUT IT DOES NOT

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.977
ADDRESS ALL SPEAK TO A MANAGER

01:26:23.044 --> 01:26:26.648
YES. MANAGER IS A REQUIRED THAT

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:29.183
TO LOOK AT THE END OF THE-

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.686
LICENSE. BUT TWO THINGS SO WHAT

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:33.555
IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF I

01:26:33.621 --> 01:26:34.923
CALLED THE PERSON S. ON MY

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:39.460
EMPLOYEE. OR LICENSE HOLDER.

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:41.095
THERE THERE IS NO PROVISION

01:26:41.162 --> 01:26:42.163
RIGHT NOW YOU CAN HAVE AN

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.098
ASSISTANT BUT THAT DOES NOT

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:45.500
NEGATE THE FACT THAT THE

01:26:45.567 --> 01:26:48.336
PRIMARY OR THE LICENSEE HAS TO

01:26:48.403 --> 01:26:50.338
STILL BE THERE 80% OF THE TIME

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:52.941
EVEN WITH AN ASSISTANT. SO

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:55.743

HIGHLY EDUCATED BUT THEY'VE

01:27:11.626 --> 01:27:14.095
DONE SO VOLUNTARILY THAT IS NOT

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.197
THE CASE FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

THAT'S IT UNDER THIS BILL IT

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:29.777

ABLE TO START. SO WITH THAT- IT

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:51.966
RAISES THE QUALITY OF THE EARLY

CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT'S

01:27:53.201 --> 01:27:55.903

THERE THE FULL 80% OF THE TIME.

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:04.579
IT WOULD ALLOW SOMEONE ELSE TO

01:28:04.646 --> 01:28:06.881
BE ABLE TO COME IN AND CONTINUE

01:28:06.948 --> 01:28:10.652

ABSENCE. NOT OVER 20% NOTE 20%%

01:28:31.639 --> 01:28:34.375
IS CURRENT RIGHT NOW. WHERE THE

01:28:34.442 --> 01:28:36.744
PROPOSAL I SINCE E DOES CAN BE

01:28:36.811 --> 01:28:38.880
GONE 20% OF THE TIME. WHAT THE

01:28:38.946 --> 01:28:40.648
SECONDARY LICENSEE WHICH DOES

01:28:40.715 --> 01:28:42.450
NOT EXIST AT THIS POINT THAT'S

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:44.085
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT WOULD

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:46.254
ALLOW. FOR THAT PERSON TO NOT

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.458
HAVE TO BE THERE 80% OF THE

01:28:50.525 --> 01:28:51.325
TIME. WELL YEAH LET TO ONLY

01:28:51.392 --> 01:28:53.161
BEING 20% IT WOULD ALLOW THAT

01:28:53.227 --> 01:28:54.796

START THAT IS CORRECT AND THE

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:08.876
REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE WE

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.344
