HAVE A QUORUM HOPEFULLY AS SOON AS WE ESTABLISH THAT WE THINK GO. SURE LACKEY FOR FORTHCOMING. SIGNATURE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE LAST MONTH IS EGGMAN PRESENT FROM THE MONTH THIS EGGMAN PRESIDENT. PATTERSON. BURKE. FRAZIER. FRAZIER PRESENT LACKEY. HERE LACKEY PRESENT MEDINA. MEDINA PRESIDENT QUICKSILVER. WE HAVE A QUORUM OUR FIRST BILL UP FOR THE DAY WILL BE MISTER STONE. WHO ATTRACTED? WORLDWIDE OPPOSITION. MINTY. PLEASE GO AHEAD YEAH ADAM CHAIR AND THANKS TO YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL AND AMENDING IT I THINK WE'VE REMOVED A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION INSTEAD OF THE SAP. SO A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE. HAD ESTABLISHED FOR THE PARCHMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THAT TAXPAYER FUNDED GRANTS THAT GO OUT TO RESEARCH BE THEN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. AT NO CHARGE BECAUSE IT'S TAXPAYER FUNDED BASICALLY PUBLICLY FUNDED. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS APPLY THAT SAME STANDARD ACROSS THE BOARD TO ALL STATE AGENTS? AND SO AFTER WITH IF THIS BILL GOES INTO EFFECT AFTER TWELVE MONTHS THEN. THAT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE A CHARGE FOR THAT RESEARCH IT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE FOR FREE TO THE PUBLIC AND AGAIN PUBLICLY FUNDED. RESEARCH SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE OUT TO THE. TAXPAYING PUBLIC AND IN ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT RESEARCH THAT'S THE POINT OF THE BILL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THAT YOUNG COUPLE WITNESSES TO. TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. GIVEN THE BOOZE IN MOAB MOVING SECOND IT DOES HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION PLEASE COULD. CERTAINLY I THOUGHT YOUR TELL MOTHERS EGGMAN UP BY SHARE PATTERSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S ERNESTO FALCONE I'M THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC IS THAT WE ARE A A LEAN NONPROFIT FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND WE HAVE OVER FOUR ONE THOUSAND DUES PAYING MEMBERS. MANY OF THEM HERE CALIFORNIA AND WE FOCUS ON POLICIES THAT BENEFIT THE USERS AND CREATORS OF TECHNOLOGY. I IN THE WORDS OF SIR ISAAC NEWTON AND I HAVE SEEN FURTHER BECAUSE I STOOD ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS. ACCESS TO PASS INFORMATION FUNDAMENTALLY ADVANCES THE PROGRESS OF KNOWLEDGE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE'S LEGISLATION WOULD ALLOW OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE. IN ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE. THE PREMISE IS SIMPLE ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER FUNDED RESEARCH KNOWLEDGE THAT IS GENERATED BY OUR COLLECTIVE INVESTMENT ACT AS CALIFORNIANS IS DISSEMINATED FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IN THE WORLD. THE OUTCOME OF THIS POLICY IS IMMEASURABLE. WHEN GOVERNMENT USED THEIR POWER TO ADVANCE KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RESEARCHERS AND FALL ONE USERS. IT ADVANCES EVERYONE TO SEE FURTHER. THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF THE REVERSE TOO MANY RESTRAINTS ARE RENTS APPLY TO INFORMATION CAN HAVE TRAGIC RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. MALARIA RESEARCHER. BY NAME OF CARDINALS NOTED THAT WHILE WESTERN SOCIETIES HAVE MADE ADVANCEMENTS AND TREATMENT FOR MALARIA SUB SAHARAN AFRICA WITH LACKEY. BECAUSE FOR THIS DISPARITY MORE THAN HALF OF THE REQUISITE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THOSE TREATMENTS WAS BEHIND A PAYWALL. AND RESEARCHERS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND SOME OF THE MOST IMPOVERISHED NATIONS OF THE WORLD SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY FOR ACCESS TO THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED. WHEN WE MAKE THIS INFORMATION FREE TO ACCESS WE MAKE OF THE ADVANCEMENTS MORE EFFICIENT AND LOW COST. TODAY MOST FEDERAL GRANTS FOR SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH CARE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL PROPOSES TODAY. BUT OTHERS ARE GOING EVEN FURTHER. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION THEY HAVE OPEN ACCESS POLICY THAT RESEARCH THEY PRODUCE IS AVAILABLE THE DAY OF PUBLICATION THE DAY OF PUBLICATION. AND COME INTO THAT SIXTEEN WHEN SCIENTISTS FIRST OBSERVED GRAVITATIONAL WAVES CONFIRMING EINSTEIN'S THEORY OF RELATIVITY. THEY MERELY PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS IN AN OPEN ACCESS JOURNAL. IF I MAKE ONE FINAL POINT ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF OPEN ACT OPEN ACCESS TO KNOWLEDGE AND THE BENEFITS IT IT PROVIDES. THE INTERNET AS WE KNOW CONNECTS EVERY PERSON WHO AND GIVES EVERYONE THE ABILITY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THAT WE WERE PRESENTED. SOMETIMES RESOLVING THESE PROBLEMS JUST REQUIRE A A NEW PERSPECTIVE IN A FRESH ANNA AND FRESH SET OF EYES. I TAKE JACK AND DRAKA WHO AT THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. RELIED ON FREE ACCESS TO INFORMATION FROM THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES JOURNAL FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH. AND DEVELOPED A METHOD TO DETECT A RARE FORM OF CANCER. JACK IS WHAT IT MEANS TO SEE FURTHER BY STANDING ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS SO IN CONCLUSION IF IT STRONGLY SUPPORTS AB TWO ONE NINE TWO WE COMMEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR BEING A LEADER ON THIS FRONT. AND I ASK FOR YOUR. VOTE IN THE FIRM THINK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. AS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. A CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND JIMMY TODAY UNICA'S OUR SCIENTISTS ON BEHALF OF OUR SIXTY THOUSAND. SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I HEAR TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND ITS GOAL OF. PUBLIC ACCESS TO PUBLICLY FUNDED RESEARCH. THIS IS DIRECTLY LINED WITH OUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION OF SCIENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY AND ALSO BROADER GOALS OF SHARING KNOWLEDGE FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD. AND TO SAY IT'S A SIMPLY. SCIENCE IS NOT MEANT TO SIT ON A SHELF. NOR IS IT MEANT TO REST IN THE HANDS OF THE FEW. AND IF IT'S WORTH FUNDING RESEARCH WE BELIEVE AND IT'S WORTH SHARING THE FRUITS OF THAT LABOR. AND A PHD CHEMIST A PROBABLY TRAINED A NEW YEAR'S EVE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. AND I SPEND MOST MY TIME WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO AIR QUALITY AND CLEAN VEHICLES AND AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ACCESSING THAT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FINDINGS. FOR PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED. SCIENTISTS THAT CAN EVALUATE AND FURTHER SHARE OF THOSE RESEARCH FINDINGS ABOUT WHAT IT LET ALONE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THAT FUNDED. THAT RESEARCH AND AND SO JUST VOTING THE WAY IT WORKS TODAY'S INVESTOR AFFILIATE WITH A LARGE RESEARCH INSTITUTION. OR WILLING TO PAY THE TYPICAL THIRTY FIVE FORTY DOLLARS ACCESS FEE FOR SINGLE JOURNAL ARTICLE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE BULK OF THE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE THAT'S OUT THERE. AND AND THIS IS THE SECOND PROBLEM AND SO THIS BILL IS REALLY. ONE THOSE GEMS OF A POLICY THAT. IT'S IT'S NOT SOMETHING ON MANY PEOPLE'S RADARS NOTS SUPER FLASHY. BUT IT IT PUNCHES ABOVE ITS WEIGHT HAS. OUT OUTSIDE BENEFITS FOR MAYBE ITS ITS NOTORIETY. IN THE PUBLIC GOOD. I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO BEAR AND OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS OF SUPPORT AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN OTHER SPEAKING IN SUPPORT TODAY. ANYBODY'S. EVEREST WE CAN I COMING SUPPORT. BASEBALL ON BEHALF OF TECHNET IN SUPPORT. DALE SHIM STOCK WITH ASSOCIATION AMERICAN PUBLISHERS WERE SORT OF AN IN BETWEEN POSITION OF WE WERE INITIALLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL BUT. WITH APRIL FIFTH AMENDMENTS WE HAVE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN ORDER TO THANK THE AUTHOR ON HIS STAFF IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAD AND.

SO I THINK THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT STEP TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THAT ACCESS. EVEN MORE TO THOSE OUTSIDE OF THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER STONE. THANK YOU AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT COMMENT. MATERIALS THAT ARE CREATED BY A PUBLIC AGENCY IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE BUT ARE OR SHOULD BE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THESE ARE WHEN WE'RE WHEN THAT THE. TAXPAYERS ARE ESSENTIALLY THROUGH AGENCIES GIVING GRANTS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BECAUSE IT'S TAXPAYER FUNDED THAT'S ALSO READILY ACCESSIBLE THAT'S THE POINT.

ONE TO ONE BUT SINCE WE ARE HERE WE HAVE A FEW MINUTES OKAY DID WANT TO ASK I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS ABOUT OF A POSSIBLE. EITHER FUTURE FUTURE HEARING OR EVEN. LEGISLATIVE ITEMS THAT COULD LOOK AT ONCE I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ONCE LEGISLATION HAS BEEN MOVED FORWARD. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WHAT TYPE OF. ACCOUNTABILITY DO WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THE BILLS ARE ACTUALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED. AND HAVE. IS NOTIFICATION MADE. TO LEGISLATORS. AND EXAMPLE WOULD BE. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN I WAS ABLE TO PASS ON. A BILL FOCUSING ON HOMELESSNESS THAT WOULD ALLOW. ADD THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO SEEK A VALID BIRTH CERTIFICATE OR AND A VALID ID WITH A FEE WAIVER. AT WHICH WE UNDERSTAND THAT NONPROFITS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT BUT THAT WAS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE DMV AND ALSO THROUGH THE. CLERKS AND. IT TOOK QUITE A BIT OF EFFORT ON OUR PART AFTER THE LEGISLATION WAS PASSED TO ENSURE THEY WERE ACTUALLY PRACTICING THAT SO. I THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE. UP MISTER BRAZIER MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK SHE SPOT ON WE'VE HAD ISSUES WITH SOME OF THE AGENCIES ONCE WE'VE HAD BILLS OF SIGNED IN PUT INTO. STATUE AND OTHERS IT SEEMS TO BE A WAITING OUT HERE THEY TRY TO WAIT YOU OUT IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT. AND SEWED LOVED IT BE HAVING A HEARING HOW WE CAN HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY COMPONENT.
