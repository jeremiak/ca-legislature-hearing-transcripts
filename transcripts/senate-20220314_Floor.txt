THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS- TODAY I RISE AND ASKED THE SENATE ADJOURNED AND THE MEMBERS OF DEAN DO YOU KNOW OUR RECORD A POSSE DINO WAS BORN SEPTEMBER TWENTY SECOND NINETEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND DIED RATHER SUDDENLY COMPLICATIONS OF A STROKE ON FEBRUARY TENTH TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO. CANACCORD APOLOGY OF STOCKTON PASSED AWAY- HE WAS THE SON OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS HIS PARENTS WERE AMERIGO INTERESA COURT APOLOGY FROM STOCKTON. AFTER GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL ISN'T JUST A FARM FARM BOY HE LIKED TO CALL HIMSELF. IN NINETEEN FORTY FIVE HE WAS IN THE VOCATIONAL TRACK AND HE DEVELOPED A RHEUMATIC FEVER- AND THEN HIS HEART BECAME WEAK AND THEY SAID YOU CAN'T WORK RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOUR HEART IS TOO WEAK. OF COURSE HE WOULDN'T STOP AND THEN HE ENDED UP HAVING A HEART ATTACK- AND HIS SOON TO BE FATHER IN LAW THE CARLY WHO BECAME LATER MAYOR STOCKTON SAID YOU SHOULD GO TO. THE LEFT TO FARM YOU SHOULD GO TO DAVIS AT THE BEST SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY TO PERFORMING. OTHERS WOULD DISAGREE AT THIS POINT THOSE NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT HE GRADUATED WITH A ASSOCIATES DEGREE- AND THEN WENT ON TO WORK- FOR PILLSBURY AS A GRAIN BUYER HE CALLED OUT HIS MBA. FROM PILLSBURY- HE MARRIED HIS HIGH SCHOOL SWEETHEART JOAN TO CARLY AT MORRIS CHAPEL IN STOCKTON AND THEY HAD FOUR CHILDREN GINO KATIE BECKY AND DAVID. FROM NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWO DO YOU KNOW WAS INVOLVED IN FARMING AND AGRIBUSINESS HIS FATHER THINK INFORMING WAS TOO HARD TO LIFE DID NOT LEAVE THE FARM TO DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY WERE. DOING FIFTEEN ACRES BUT HE WAS DETERMINED AND BY THE TIME HE DIED HE WAS FARMING OUR CONTROLLING OVER SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. IN CALIFORNIA OF AGRIBUSINESS EVERYONE DESCRIBES HIM AS LARGER. THAN LIFE IN A FORCE OF NATURE- HIGH INTENSE PERSON- HE HAD MULTIPLE. PARTNERS INCLUDING COURT PARTY PARTNERS COCOA FARMS DEL REAL PARTNERS LOAN I FARMING- ALL OF THESE STILL OWNED AND OPERATED OFTENTIMES BY DINO- AND THEN HE BECAME INTERESTED IN THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUCH. AS YOU LIKE TO CALL IT A PROCESSING PACKING MARKETING SIDE OF AGRIBUSINESS. ARE HE AND- HAD STANDS UP FOR PRODUCTS GARY CANNING SIERRA QUALITY CANNERS AMIR GLAND TOMATOES IN COURT TO OLIVE OIL. HE PROBABLY ALL USE THE PRODUCTS THAT HE DEVELOPED. HE UNDERSTOOD ALL OF THESE AND HAD A REAL FINESSE IN THINGS HE LOVED BEING PRESENTED WITH A PROBLEM. DEVELOPING A COUPLE AS- POSSIBLE OPTIONS AND THEN LETTING PEOPLE PICK THE REST HE LOVED THE CHALLENGED WELL CALCULATED RISKS- HE ALSO LOVE THINGS LIKE FLY FISHING DUCK HUNTING- HE- PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER. HE SUED IN NINETEEN. M. EIGHTY EIGHT SIXTY NINETY SUED LIBBY MCNEIL AND LIBBY FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT ONE THAT. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HE SUED THEN GOVERNOR ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER FOR MISMANAGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA STATE FUNDS. AND YOU MAY REMEMBER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN HE STARTED STATEWIDE. CAMPAIGN AGAINST JERRY BROWN'S- THE HE TRIED TO DO THE PROP FIFTY THREE CRUSADE AGAINST REVENUE BONDS AND HE HAD. ARTICLES AND ALL PAPERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE LIAR LIAR PANTS ON FIRE. HE NEVER BACKED AWAY FROM A FIGHT I THINK WHEN HE DIED HE WAS STILL SUING- THE AT IT. ONE OF THE FOUNDATIONS WORKING TOWARDS RESTORING THE DELTA- HE DESIGNED HIS OWN ARM HE DESIGNED AT MOST EVERYTHING AROUND HIM- HIS WITH HIS FAVORITE SAYINGS WHERE LIFE IS A BANQUET AT WHICH MANY GO HUNGRY. ARITHMETIC IS NOT AN OPINION. CHANCE FAVORS THE PREPARED MIND. AND GET IN POSITION AND GET LUCKY. IT WAS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO KNOW DINO COURT APOLOGY HIS. EXTREME WORK ETHIC HIS BELIEF IN THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA WHAT YOU PUT IN WHAT YOU SOW IS WHAT YOU GETBACK. HE'S INCREDIBLY STRATEGIC MIND MOST A LOT OF THINGS IN STOCKTON AND. INNOCENT LOOKING COUNTY HAVE THE COURT OPPOSING NAME ON IT THANK. J. FAMILY- AND WE STAND AND ASK THE SENATE AND- IN HIS- AND WISH OUR BEST TO HIS FOUR CHILDREN HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND HIS DEVOTED WIFE JOHN. PLEASE BRING HIS NAME FORWARD TO THE DESK SO THAT HE MAY BE APPROPRIATELY MEMORIALIZED BY THE SENATE. HE WE'RE GONNA TAKE OVER A TEN MINUTE RECESS SO THAT WE CAN WAIT FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL FILE TO ARRIVE HERE IN THE SENATE. MAKE SURE TO PLEASE STAY ON THE ON THE FLOOR. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU COULD TAKE YOUR CONVERSATIONS OFF THE FLOOR IF YOU MUST HAVE THEM OTHERWISE YOU'RE MOVING ON TO. UNFINISHED BUSINESS THE SUPPLEMENTAL FILE AND SENATOR SKINNER ON FILE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY FIVE. YEAH YOUR RIGHT. TAKE IT. WHAT'S MORE CENTERS- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE EIGHTEEN BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACT RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. SENATOR SKINNER THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH. MADAM PRESIDENT AND- MEMBERS. YES P. ONE EIGHTEEN ADDRESSES THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND OURSELVES NOW WE'RE WITHOUT IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION UC BERKELEY COULD BE FORCED OR WOULD BE FORCED TO ENROLL FEWER STUDENTS IN THIS UPCOMING FALL BECAUSE OF A COURT ORDER TO. ONE STUDENT ENROLLMENT THAT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF A SEQUEL LAWSUIT. THE COURT'S ORDER CAPPING ENROLLMENT AT THE SAME THE COURT'S ORDER CAPS ENROLLMENT AT THE SAME LEVEL AS FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BY DOING THAT IT IMPACTS A LARGER NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEN HAD THAT CAPTAIN COULD STAY IN. TWO PREVIOUS YEARS BECAUSE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. UC BERKELEY'S FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN ROMANS WAS LOWER THAN THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. TIME IS RUNNING OUT UC BERKELEY'S REMAINING OFFERS OF ADMISSION ARE SCHEDULED TO BE ISSUED ON MARCH FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITHOUT A SOLUTION APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SIX HUNDRED AND POTENTIALLY HIGHER STUDENTS MAY LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND UC BERKELEY THIS FALL. AND THAT HAS IMPLICATIONS ON ALL OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS DISCUSSING THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF UC BERKELEY AT THE MOMENT WHAT WE ARE ALSO ADDRESSING BY OUR ACTION TODAY IS THE IMPLICATIONS ON OUR THREE OTHER. OR NOT THREE OTHER OR TO OTHER HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS PLUS ALL OTHER UC CAMPUSES. NOW PUTTING A CAP ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS ALSO UNPRECEDENTED WHILE THE STATUTE RELATING TO CAMPUS LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THIRTY ODD YEARS YEAH THERE HAVE BEEN MANY LAWSUITS RELATED TO LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN ISSUED A CAP ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT. THE BILL BEFORE US IS DESIGNED NOT ONLY TO ELIMINATE THE DRASTIC IMPACT ON UC BERKELEY'S ENROLLMENT FOR THIS COMING FALL. BUT AS I MENTIONED SINCE THE COURT'S ACTION HAS IMPLICATIONS ON ALL THREE OF OUR SEGMENTS BECAUSE THAT STATUTE ON LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS IS A REQUIREMENT. PLACED ON. ALL CAMPUSES COMMITTEE COLLEGES CSU'S EMERGENCIES. THAT ARE. THIS BILL IS ALSO DESIGNED TO PREVENT SIMILAR CAPS ON ANY OTHER CAMPUSES STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN THE FUTURE. IT ALSO ALIGNS THE STATUTE WITH OUR THE LEGISLATURE'S LONG STANDING POLICY TO EXPAND RATHER THAN REDUCE STUDENT ACCESS TO PUBLIC IRE TO HIGHER EDUCATION. LET ME DESCRIBE SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES IT MODIFIES THE LANGUAGE IN OUR PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE RELATED TO LRT PEAS THAT'S LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS BY REMOVING THE SENTENCE THAT SINGLED OUT STUDENT ENROLLMENT WHILE RETAINING THE REQUIREMENT. THE PUBLIC HERE TO HIGHER EDUCATION CAMPUSES WOULD PREPARE A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT. FULL RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS NO I SPECIFY THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT AN EXEMPTION UNDER SECRET THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT IT L. R. D. P. THAT IS EXEMPTED IT IS RATHER THAT WE ARE NOT FREE OR DENYING THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT MAY IN AND OF ITSELF BE THE HIGHEST ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OVER ANY OTHER OF THE ACTIVITIES. IN OUR PROJECTS OR POPULATIONS ENGAGED IN THE CAMPUS. SO IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT FINES. WELL IT IT USUALLY DOES THE BILL IT CLARIFIES THAT ENROLLMENT CHANGES BY THEMSELVES DO NOT CONSTITUTE A SEPARATE PROJECT UNDER SECRET AND THAT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED. THE LINE IN THAT STATUTE AND THE STATUTE AS A WHOLE HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR THIRTY YEARS AND YET WE HAVE NEVER HAD A COURT ST. THAT STUDENT ROMAN ALONE IS A PROJECT UNDER SECRET OUR STATUTE MAKES THE L. R. D. P. A. PROJECT UNDER SECRET. SO IN THE EVENT THAT A COURT FINDS THE CAMPUS'S ACTIVITIES ARE IN VIOLATION OF THE CAMPUSES LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN IT ALLOWS THE COURT TO ORDER THE CAMPUS. TO PREPARE ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS INCLUDING UP TO A FULL ER IF THE COURT DETERMINES THAT THE INCREASES IN CAMPUS POPULATION. EXCEEDS THE PRODUCTION PROJECTIONS ADOPTED IN THE MOST RECENT L. R. D. P. AND ANALYZED IN THE SUPPORTING. ENVIRONMENTAL MATERIALS. IT PROVIDES EIGHTEEN MONTHS FOR THE CAMPUS AFFECTED TO CERTIFY A NEW E. I. R. OR THE NEW ANALYSIS BEFORE THE COURT IS AUTHORIZED. TO ENJOIN INCREASES IN CAMPUS POPULATION THAT EXCEEDS THE PROJECTIONS. AND IT SPECIFIES THAT ANY INJUNCTION OR JUDGMENT IN EFFECT AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS BILL THAT IMPACT STUDENT ENROLLMENT ARE UNENFORCEABLE. AND IT SPECIFIES THAT THE CHANGES TO THE STATUTE THAT WE WOULD BE MAKING IN SP ONE EIGHTEEN ARE RETROACTIVE. NOW AS I STATED PREVIOUSLY THE CHANGES ARE DESIGNED TO ENABLE UC BERKELEY TO EXTENDED MISSIONS OFFERS AS PLANNED FOR THIS COMING FALL. AARON TO PROTECT OR PUBLIC CARRIAGE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES FROM SIMILAR ISSUES IN THE FUTURE. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PART TIME STAFF OR BUDGET STAFF DECEMBER IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHO ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. VOTE ON SB ONE EIGHTEEN. MADAM PRO TEM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN- A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO WE WERE PRESENTED WITH AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE- CERTAINLY AS THE BUDGETEERS INDICATED WITH ALL JUDICIAL RECOURSE EXHAUSTED IN COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE LETTERS SET TO GO OUT. OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED INCOMING UC BERKELEY STUDENTS WERE AT RISK OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ATTEND ONE OF OUR NATION'S VERY BEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES NEXT FALL. AND I WANNA IN PARTICULAR SPEAK ON THIS AND TAKE A MOMENT BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS- THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE BILL'S AUTHOR THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY FOR HER INCREDIBLE WORK WRITING A BILL THAT WILL SINGLE HANDEDLY CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF SO MANY OF OUR STATE'S MOST ACCOMPLISHED STUDENTS. AND ENSURE THAT THEIR DREAMS ARE NOT DE RAIL. SINCE THE SUPREME COURT DECISION. THE SENATOR FROM BERKLEY WORK RELENTLESSLY AROUND THE CLOCK GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH ATTORNEYS AND STAFF FOR COUNTLESS HOURS. EVERY TIME A ROAD BLOCK WAS PUT UP SHE REFUSED TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER AND KEPT WORKING UNTIL A SOLUTION WAS FOUND. AND THEN SHE PUT PEN TO PAPER HERSELF. SB ONE EIGHTEEN IS A PRIME EXAMPLE OF THE LEGISLATURE ACTING QUICKLY TO MAKE SURE STUDENTS ARE PUT FIRST. AND AHEAD OF A NARROW SET OF INTEREST. AND I DON'T USUALLY DO THIS BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- SOMETIMES TO REALLY ACKNOWLEDGE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES THE LION'S SHARE OF WORK. AND I APPRECIATED I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND I URGE YOUR I'VE BUILT ON THIS BILL. SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN OF THE SENATE I AGREE WITH THE PRO TEN THIS IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND I WILL SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. BUT NOT FOR YOU SEE. HIGHER EDUCATION FOR DECADES HAS OVER AND ROLLED AND ENROLLED LARGER NUMBERS OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS FOR THE SAKE OF MONEY. NOT POLICY MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT IT IS ABOUT MONEY FOR THE UNIVERSITY. THAT SOMETIMES THOUGH NOT ALWAYS RESULTS IN QUALITY EDUCATION. AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR- ATTENDEES I WON'T SAY OUR YOUTH ITSELF IS GOOD. THE MODIFICATION OF SICK ONE AND IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR SOME OF THE- YOU SEE PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SECRET REFORM NOW IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEM. MOST OF THE TIME THEY DO NOTHING BUT OPPOSE ANY SICK PERFORM FOR OTHER. ENDEAVORS AND INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S MY POINT WE NEED A BROAD DEEP SLEEPER REFORM NOT PICKING AROUND THE EDGES AS WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE FOR SPORTS STADIUMS FOR EXAMPLE. I ARGUE THAT THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD USE SOMEBODY OUT MAYBE SURE TO KEEP THE TEAM IN TOWN MAYBE. THAT'S NOT THE BROKEN PORTENT USE. THE FRONT. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT IS A GOOD USE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS THAT WILL NOW BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. BECAUSE OF. BECAUSE OF A SHORTAGE COURT DECISION MAYBE. BUT I'VE LEARNED OVER THE YEARS NOT TO BE SO CRITICAL OF COURT DECISIONS. MANY OF THEM I HAVE OPPOSED OVER THE DECADES MMHM LOCAL LEVEL COURT DECISIONS THE US SUPREME COURT DECISIONS ON MANY OCCASIONS. THAT COURT MADE A INDEPENDENT DECISION. THE RIGHT DECISION CERTAINLY NOT FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS. NOT FOR THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL. AND IN THAT RESPECT I URGE A NO VOTE. SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I FULLY- AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS MEASURE AND I ALSO WANNA ECHO ON THE PRETENCE REMARKS AND EXPRESS MY DEEP GRATITUDE- TO THE SENATOR FROM BERKELEY FOR HER EXTRAORDINARY LEADERSHIP- BECAUSE OF HER LEADERSHIP AND THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT HERE THOUSANDS OF LIVES OF YOUNG PEOPLE WILL BE BETTER SO THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES THE LAWSUIT THAT LED UP TO THIS ARBITRARY- COP OF UC BERKELEY'S AND ROMAN- WILL HARM THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING. TO GET AN EDUCATION AND THIS EMERGENCY TRIAGE LEGISLATION WILL SOLVE THAT IMMEDIATE PROBLEM. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ASK OURSELVES HOW WE GOT HERE. HOW ON EARTH DID OUR SYSTEM OF LAW IN CALIFORNIA ENABLE PEOPLE TO USE AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. TO DICTATE HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE ALLOWED TO ATTEND UC CAMPUS. THE ANSWER IS THAT TRAGICALLY A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL LAW SYKORA. HAS BEEN DISTORTED BUT BEYOND RECOGNITION TO EMPOWER ANYONE WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE A LAWYER TO DELAY OR BLOCK EVEN THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PROJECTS. THE TRAIN WRECK THAT WE'RE RESOLVING TODAY AT BERKELEY WAS VERY HIGH PROFILE AND MADE HEADLINES EVERYWHERE. BUT LET'S BE CLEAR THAT WHAT HAPPENED AT BERKELEY. WAS NOT EVEN REMOTELY UNIQUE. WHAT HAPPENED AT BERKELEY HAPPENS EVERY DAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOT IN WAYS TO GENERATE NATIONAL HEADLINES ARE LOTS OF TWITTER TRAFFIC'S. NOT IN WAYS TO GET THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE RILED UP BUT A MUCH QUIETER SMALLER WAYS. THAT DEEPLY HARM OUR STATE. IN MANY WAYS TRAGICALLY SEE WHAT IS THE LAW THAT SWALLOWED CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION THE SEQUEL BEING USED TO ARBITRARILY CAPPED YOU SEE IN ROMAN SEQUEL HAS BEEN USED TO STOP OR DELAY BIKE LANES IT'S BEEN USED TO STOP OR DELAY TRAINS AND OTHER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. IT'S BEEN USED TO STOP CLEAN ENERGY PROJECTS IT'S BEEN USED TO STOP APARTMENT BUILDINGS LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT TO A TRAIN STATION. THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ALL GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. THESE HELP REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND YES SECRET TRAGICALLY HAS BEEN REGULARLY USE TO STOP OR THE LADIES CLIMATE FRIENDLY PROJECTS. HOW COULD THAT BE AND THE ANSWER IS THAT WHEN SIEGEL WAS WRITTEN FIFTY PLUS YEARS AGO. CLIMATE CHANGE WAS NOT THE FOCUS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS. SEQUEL WAS CREATED WHEN ANY AND ALL DEVELOPMENT WAS CONSIDERED BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN POPULATION GROWTH WAS CONSIDERED THE TOP ENVIRONMENTAL THREAT WHEN LIMITING GROWTH IN CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKELEY AND SANTA MONICA WAS CONSIDERED PRO ENVIRONMENT. BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THAT APPROACH MAKING IT HARDER IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD ANYTHING ANYWHERE NO MATTER HOW ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE ACTUALLY FUELS CLIMATE CHANGE. AND AS A RESULT BY ALLOWING BLOCK THINGS LIKE INFILL HOUSING TRANSIT AND CLEAN ENERGY SEE WHAT TRAGICALLY IS USED AND ABUSED IN A WAY THAT HELPS FUEL CLIMATE CHANGE. WHEN C. QUEST USED TO STOP DENSE URBAN INFILL DEVELOPMENTS. THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE LIVED IN THOSE APARTMENTS THEY DON'T EVAPORATE THEY'RE GONNA LIVE FURTHER AWAY WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRIVE MORE AND MORE CARBON EMISSIONS. ONE SEQUEL IS USED TO STOP SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING TO DRIVE MORE. WHEN C. WAS USED TO BLOCK STUDENTS FROM ENROLLING AT UC BERKELEY A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE VERY MUCH. THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE WHERE THEY HAVE TO DRIVE MORE THAN CARBON EMISSIONS GO UP. I WANT TO BE CLEAR SEQUEL IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT LAW I DO NOT AGREE WITH THOSE WHO SAY THAT IT SHOULD BE ELIMINATED OR REPEALED THAT WOULD BE A BAD. IDEA SEQUEL HAS DONE MANY GOOD THINGS IN TERMS OF SLOWING DOWN OR% STOPPING PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE. BUT I DO AGREE THAT SICK ONE NEEDS TO BE MODERNIZED SO THAT IT IS INTENSELY FOCUSED. ON CLIMATE ACTION. THAT IS WHY ENVIRONMENTAL ACTION IS ABOUT TODAY. AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO SEE WHAT TO BE A TOOL TO ACHIEVE. SO LET'S PASS THIS MEASURE TODAY LET'S LET THE STUDENTS GET AN EDUCATION. BUT LET'S NOT THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT THIS MESS WAS SOMEHOW AN ANOMALY. WHEN IT COMES TO SEE WHAT THIS UC BERKELEY TRAIN WRECK ISN'T A BUG. IT'S A FEATURE I ASKED FOR AN AIBO. SYNERGY. ONE AT MEMBERS TODAY I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTEEN AS SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE US STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AND STUDENTS APPLYING TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I KNOW WHAT AN ADMISSIONS DECISION MEANS TO MANY I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE APPLICATION I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO WRITE A COLLEGE ESSAY I'VE EDITED HUNDREDS IN MY LIFE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO THROUGH THE FINANCIAL AID PROCESS WITH THE DREAM AND HOPE OF GOING TO HIRE AND- I BELIEVE THAT THE STUDENTS TODAY NOT JUST FOR UC BERKELEY BUT STUDENTS ACROSS ALL THREE OF OUR SYSTEMS UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEMS. WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR APPROACH. BUT ALTHOUGH I RISE IN SUPPORT OF TODAY'S BILL I DO WANT TO INSURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. IF THE UNIVERSITIES DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH SEA QUEST FOR INCREASED ENROLLMENT THERE HAVE GOT TO BE ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE THAT STUDENT HOUSING IS ADDRESSED. I WORK WITH TOO MANY STUDENTS WHO ARE LIVING IN CARS WHO ARE COUCH SURFING WHO ARE LIVING IN HOTELS NOT JUST ON MY UNIVERSITY CAMPUS BUT ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS IN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. AND THERE IS JUST SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH STUDENT HOUSING. THIS IMPACTS THEIR ACADEMICS IT IMPACTS OUR OVERALL WELL BEING AND IT IMPACTS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THE STUDENT HOUSING CRISIS HAS AN IMPACT ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. WE MUST ENSURE THAT STUDENT HOUSING IS ADEQUATE THAT IT'S HEALTHY AND THAT IT'S SAFE. THE UC'S MUST ADDRESS THE ENROLLMENT ISSUE. NEW LEGISLATION TODAY WE DON'T WANT TO DISREGARD THE ESTABLISHED PROCESS WE KNOW THAT OUR UNIVERSITIES NEW BUT GUIDELINES AND REQUIREMENTS WE ALSO HAVE UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE A LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THEM. AND WILE WE TRIED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR STUDENTS WE ALSO CANNOT LEAVE OUR COMMUNITIES BEHIND AND WE CANNOT. LEAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO JUST THE LEGISLATURE. OUR SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION MUST BE PARTNERS IN SHARING THIS RESPONSIBILITY. THANK YOU SIS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALSO NEED TO FIND A WAY TO WORK MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION. NOT JUST THE SITUATION IN FRONT OF US BUT THE ONGOING ISSUES THAT ENROLLMENT WILL BRING TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO OUR CITIES TO OUR COUNTIES TO ALL OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. AND I VOTED TODAY DOES NOT NEGATE OUR RESPONSIBILITY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING AND OUR COMMUNITY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS ISSUE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. SOLUTIONS THAT WILL IMPACT OUR UNIVERSITIES WITH INCREASED ENROLLMENT. WITH THAT MEMBERS I DO HOPE THAT WE SUPPORT THIS BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE ONGOING ISSUES THAT WILL BE PRESENTED TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. VETR LOWERED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M NOT- LET ME SAY FIRST IT ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE THE BUDGET CHAIR AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT WORKED ON THIS GETS TREMENDOUS CREDIT BECAUSE THERE WAS A VERY UNIQUE CALL OUT IN THE LAW HAD CITED ENROLLMENT AND TURNED IT INTO A PROJECT THAT SHOULD NEVER BE THAT WAS AN OVER REACH THE STUDENTS THAT WERE POTENTIALLY DENIED SHOULD NOT BE DENIED THIS FIXES IT AND I'M GOING TO BE PROUD TO VOTE FOR IT- IN A MINUTE. I THINK THERE'S A NUANCE HERE BECAUSE MANY OF THE SPEECHES HAVE BEEN GIVEN COMPLETELY. ABOUT SEQUEL. AND YET IF- AND I KNOW I SAID THIS IN THE BUDGET HEARING THIS MORNING. HI I WAS ONCE MAYOR OF A TOWN THAT HOSTS A UNIVERSITY THAT IS A CITY OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INSIDE OF SIXTY THOUSAND PERSON CITY. THEN THERE IS A COMPLETE AND TOTAL CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTION FROM ANY LOCAL LAND USE ANY LOCAL TAXES AND FEES ANY LOCAL RESIDENTS OF REGULATION OF ANY KIND. SO WHEN EXAMPLES OF TRAIN HOUSING BALL PARKS ARE ARE RAISED THOSE ALL HAVE PROCESSES THEY GO THROUGH THE NORMAL ORDER OF THINGS NONE OF THEM HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL EXEMPTION FROM LAND USE REVIEW. YOU SEE DOGS AND SO IF YOU. ARE THE SENATOR FROM SANTA BARBARA THE JUST SPOKE THERE WAS A HUGE DORM WITH NO WINDOWS ON A COASTAL BLUFF. THAT DESERVES TO GO THROUGH SOME FORM OF LAND USE IT IN SANTA CRUZ WE ARE NOW IN A HIGH FIRE SO THE ENTIRE CAMPUS WAS EVACUATED IN THE CZ YOU FIRE THE FIRE THAT TOOK NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HOUSES MADE IT TO THE UPPER REACHES. OF THE CAMPUS THIS IS TRUE ACROSS THE STATE THAT IS WHY THE ISSUE OF UC IS DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THEM. AND THE NEEDLE WAS THREADED HERE THE LONG RANGE DEVELOPMENT PLAN STILL ARE SUBJECT TO SPEAKER AND THAT IS TOTALLY APPROPRIATE. HAVING THEM SUBJECT TO NO LAND USE REGULATION OF ANY KIND WOULD BE A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD AND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AND I AM HOPING THAT EVERYONE THAT IS SO STRONGLY BEHIND THIS JOINS US IN DOING THE STEPS WE HAVE TO DO. WE APPROPRIATED TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR HOUSING AT HIGHER EDUCATION LAST YEAR SIX HUNDRED MILLION GOES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IT IS ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE HAVE TO DO MORE. LAST YEAR WE DID A CAP BUT THE THREE CAMPUSES THAT HAVE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF OUT OF STATE STUDENTS. SO PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN PAYING TAXES IN THE STATE. CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEIR KIDS CAN GET INTO A UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUS. AND IN OUR BUDGET HEARING THIS YEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BEFORE WE EVEN KNEW THIS LAWSUIT WAS OUT THERE. WE BASICALLY SAID TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU CAN'T JUST BE JAMMING MORE STUDENTS ON EVERY CAMPUS YOU HAVE TO HAVE PLANS FOR ADDITIONAL CAMPUSES. FOR CENTERS FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATELY TAKE THE GROWTH THAT WE WANT AND WE NEED AND ONE OF THE FINEST PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. SO I JUST HOPE. THAT THERE'S JUST A RECOGNITION THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS A UNIQUE SITUATION. AND HAVING SAID THAT- THIS NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND WALMART CALLED OUT AS A PROJECT AND I HOPE EVERYBODY SUPPORTS THIS BILL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY. SENATOR WRESTLE. THANK YOU MAN PRESENT I THINK SOME COMMENTS ARE MADE THAT ARE ARE EXCELLENT I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY OUT ON TO THEM BECAUSE I THINK THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT IN ADDRESSING A PART PROBLEM THAT- MAKE IT WORSE AND UNFORTUNATELY- OF THEIR ACTIONS BEING TAKEN TO COUNTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR UNIVERSITIES WHICH ARE SECOND TO NONE IN THE NATION. AND I THINK HAVE LED TO HELP CREATE SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR STATE I MEAN ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE LOCATED THEY TEND TO BE LOCATED IN WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHEN THEY WERE FIRST SIGHTED THEY WEREN'T WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHAT HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHY ARE OUR OUR UNIVERSITIES LOCATION CONTRIBUTING TO MORE INVESTMENT IN THOSE AREAS AND BETTER HOUSING I WENT TO UCLA. I KNOW IT'S A HARD THING FOR ME TO FIND OFF CAMPUS HOUSING BECAUSE I WAS SURROUNDED BY OUR UNIVERSITY TRYING TO BUY A BELLAIRE AND WEST LA AND BEVERLY HILLS SO WHERE STUDENTS CAN LIVE I HAD TO LIVE IN A VAN OFF CAMPUS- RIDING MY BIKE TO WORK BECAUSE I COULDN'T EVEN PARK MY VAN CLOSE TO THE CAMPUS BECAUSE OF PERMIT PARKING. PENCIL AND RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE OF UCLA. ONE OF THE- MOST EXPENSIVE HOMES IN ALL OF THE UNITED STATES IS CURRENTLY LISTED FOR SALE. SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHAT THESE UNIVERSITIES TO FURTHER SURROUNDING AREAS THEY TEND TO HAVE. LOTS OF VEHICLES WITH SUSTAINABLE ENERGY SO NO EMISSIONS LIKE I KNOW UCSD UCLA ARE DOING I KNOW. BERKELEY HAS SIMILAR PROGRAMS ALL OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE LEADERS IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY. IN OUR ARE REDUCING THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT. ARE PROVIDING STUDENT TRANSPORTATION ON SITE IN OUR CAMPUSES BUT LET'S FACE IT. ON OUR CAMPUSES WHERE STUDENTS MOST LIKELY TO DO WALK. OR RIDE A BICYCLE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT VARMINT OLYMPIC. I THINK SEQUEL IS BEING ABUSED. I THINK WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING TO CURB THIS WITH REGARD TO OUR UNIVERSITIES. UCSD A LAWSUIT BLOCKED THE CREATION OF A HILLEL HOUSE. THAT ACTUALLY HAD ENVIRONMENTAL THAT PRETTY MUCH LIMITED OR ELIMINATED THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. AND THE PEOPLE SUING DIDN'T LIVE ON PROPERTIES THAT DID THE SAME THING. HOW WAS THAT EVEN SURE. THEY BLOCKED THE INTRODUCTION OF A OF A TROLLEY LINE THAT WOULD'VE BROUGHT OF YOU KNOW. ALLOWED STUDENTS TO COME IN WITHOUT HAVING TO DRIVE INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY ALLOW THE- THEY BLOCKED THE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR STUDENTS. THIS IS JUST AN ABUSE OF THE LAW. BUT WHAT IS IT THE EFFECT IT CAN HAVE AN ARGUMENT OR OR UNIVERSITIES. TO REDUCING THE COMPETITIVENESS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT POPULATION IN UNIVERSITY IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY TRANSLATE TO A REDUCTION. IN QUALITY OF EDUCATION UCLA IS THE MOST POPULATED UNIVERSITY IN CALIFORNIA AND IT IS THE NUMBER ONE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN THE NATION WITH THE HIGHEST. AMOUNT OF RESEARCH DOLLARS. BEING IN. IN ALL OF THE UNIVERSITIES OF CALIPHS. SO I THINK THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THAT THESE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON NEIGHBORHOODS INCLUDING PROVIDING FACILITIES AND ACCESS TO SERVICES AND OFTEN- A TOP RATE OF CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL SERVICES TO THE NAME NEIGHBORING MEMBERS. BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE THE- AN AMAZING JOB ENGINE AND A SOURCE OF NEW INNOVATIVE IDEAS FOR CALIFORNIA AND I THINK IT'S TIME- WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD WORK MY COLLEAGUES IN BUDGET AND- THE CENTER FOR BERKELEY WHO HAS TAKEN THE SONG AND I HOPE THIS. WILL APPLY EQUALLY TO ALL OUR UNIVERSITIES AND WHEN WE START TO LOOK AT LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BUILD HOUSING MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE CURRENTLY IF YOU'RE A STUDENT ONE OF OUR UNIVERSITIES OFTEN TIME. OFF ON CAMPUS HOUSING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OFF CAMPUS HOUSING AND WE NEED TO CORRECT THAT AS WELL THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTERS SCANNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR MADAM PRESIDENT- THE RISK OF- CHEATING MYSELF- I THINK SOME SUN MAYBE ONLY A FEW OF US WILL REMEMBER THEIR CARTOON POGO WHERE THE LINE WAS WE HAVE MET THE ENEMY AND IT IS US AND I THINK IN MUCH OF WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE WE COULD LOOK AT THE FACT THAT FOR EXAMPLE. I ATTENDED UC BERKELEY SOME FORTY FIVE OR SO YEARS AGO AND AT THE TIME THE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WAS HALF OR EVEN LESS THAN HALF OF IT IS TODAY SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE ONLY ADDED ONE UC CAMPUS SO WE HAVE DOUBLED CAMPUS YET OUR MASTER PLAN A PIRATE SAYS THAT WE WILL PROVIDE. THE SUPPORT FOR ALL QUALIFIED STUDENTS. NOW WE'VE ADDED A FEW MORE SEE ISSUES BUT AGAIN WE LOOK AT OUR POPULATION WE'VE NOT ADDED THAT MANY. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SITUATION OF PERHAPS THE UNIVERSITY'S. INCREASING THEIR ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS TO PAY MORE STUDENTS WHO ARE OUT OF STATE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR- THE LEGISLATURE'S FUNDING. OF OUR CAMPUSES AND YOU GO BACK OVER A TEN TWENTY YEAR PERIOD UNTIL THE LAST FOUR YEARS. THE PROPORTION THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM THE STATE AS COMPARED TO. EITHER OF THEIR TUITION OR ARE THERE OTHER ALL KINDS OF OTHER EXTERNAL SOURCES WHICH GREATLY OUT OF PROPORTION SO IN OTHER WORDS WE USED TO FIND. OUR UC SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE. AND THUS WE MORALLY HAD MUCH MORE OF A RIGHT TO LIMIT HOW MANY OUT OF STATE STUDENTS NOW WE ARE DOING SO BY BACK FILLING THOSE- THAT FUNDING SO WE ARE DOING THAT. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING CRISIS. OBVIOUSLY OUR CAMPUSES WHETHER CSU'S COMMITTEE COLLEGES OR YOU SEASON WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE STUDENTS IN ALL THREE SEGMENTS WERE LIVING IN CARS NOW WERE WITHOUT SHELTER. NONE OF OUR SEGMENTS HAVE PROVIDED ENOUGH HOUSING NINE BUT AT THE SAME TIME NONE OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE EITHER. AND IF WE LOOK AT MY PARTICULAR. TOWN AND I STAYED IN BERKELEY AFTER GRADUATING FROM UC INVALID THERE EVER SINCE MY OWN TOWN. PASSED A VOTER INITIATIVE THAT PREVENTED THE BUILDING OF ANY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING FOR DECADES THEY PASS THAT IN MY SECOND YEAR AT CAL. SO NOT ONLY SO WE CAN SAY YES UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA- C. H. U. R. C. C. C. YOU BETTER BUILD ON MORE HOUSING HOWEVER WE HAVE TO TELL THE COMMUNITIES ALSO. BECAUSE THE HOUSING. ALL OF OUR MAKE. IT SHOULD NOT BE ON THE BACKS OF STUDENTS ALONE SO SP ONE EIGHTEEN DOES NOT FIX ALL THOSE PROBLEMS BY ANY MEANS NOR DOES IT ELIMINATE THE POPULATION AND OF COURSE STUDENTS ARE PART OF A CAMPUS POPULATION SO THEY WILL STILL HAVE TO BE EVALUATED AS EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE CAMPUS WHICH IS WHAT S. B. EIGHT ONE EIGHTEEN. IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE NOT ONLY CHIEF I GET THAT RIGHT BALANCE THAT ALL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND NOT A PARTICULAR WAY SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE ON SB ONE EIGHTEEN AND I WANT TO GET AN EXPRESS MY DEEP APPRECIATION THE PRO TEM STAFF WERE PHENOMENAL IN THIS EFFORT AS WELL AS THE BUDGET STAFF AND SO MANY MORE AND OUR- WHOLE HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION SO PRECIADO IN AND YES ON SB EIGHTEEN. ONE EIGHTEEN. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA I. ADKINS.

IT ALLOWS FUNDS FOR THE COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING POST TO BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN BUDGET PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN MEET STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS AND IT MAKES OTHER TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING CHANGES THE BILL IS PRIMARILY TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND DOES NOT RESULT IN NEW COSTS WITHOUT I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR NELSON. SENATE PRESIDENT LATER GENTLENESS AND URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS. AGAIN IT'S NECESSARY FOR THE BUDGET I SUPPOSE. BUT IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE EXCESSES AUTHORIZING PROJECTS IN PAST BUDGET TO BE PAID FOR IN FUTURE BUDGETS. AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT'S GETTING TO BE A HABIT NOW HABIT NOT GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT ALSO PROVIDES MONEY TO DO SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US OPPOSED. DECERTIFICATION THE POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. THAT WAS PASSED NOW WE'RE GONNA PAY THE PRICE. THE PART OF THE PRICES. COMPROMISED OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA FIND IN THIS LEGISLATION. IT CIRCUMVENTS OUR NORMAL PROCEDURES WHICH AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE IS GET IN THE HABIT OF DOING WHERE WE HAVE. AT LEAST TWO POLICY COMMITTEE HEARINGS. TWO FISCAL COMMITTEE HEARINGS. AND NOW WE'VE BECOME USED TO FAST TRACKING THINGS I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. I DON'T THINK THEY LIKE IT IF THEY KNEW ABOUT IT AND THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE PRESS DOESN'T EVEN MAKE AN ISSUE OF IT ANYMORE. BLOCK NO BIG DEAL. SO MANY THINGS HAVE. HAPPENED ARE HAPPENING HERE. THAT CUT OUT. THE PUBLIC THE DIVORCE CITIZEN INPUT. FROM THE INPUT THAT WE DESERVE LEGISLATORS ON THEIR BEHALF. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS HOW WE DEAL WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS NOW. PUBLIC COMMENT USED TO TRULY BE PUBLIC COMMENT PEOPLE COULD COME AND COMMENT AND SAY WHAT THEY WANTED TO SAY FLOOR DEBATE. TO THE MEMBERS PRESENTING THE BILL THEN MAYBE ONE OTHER ORDERS TO ALL TO POSSIBLY. THAT EVERYBODY ELSE ALL THEY GET TO DO IS SAY I'M FORD AND I'M AGAINST. NOW I SUGGESTED WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT HABIT WE SIMPLY HAVE THE. OPERATOR OF THE PHONE SYSTEM. TAKE A POLL. BY PEOPLE CALLED IN FOR TEN AGAINST. THAT'S ALL THAT'S WORTH BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY MEANINGFUL PUBLIC INPUT. FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM.
