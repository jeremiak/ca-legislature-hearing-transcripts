THE REGULATIONS I'M JUST

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:20.252
WONDERING IF THE PURPOSE OF THIS

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.153
IS TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:23.622
FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGULATION OF

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:24.589
THE TAXICAB INDUSTRY.

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:26.291
WHY IT MAKES SENSE TO EXEMPT FOR

00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:27.726
THE MOST POPULOUS CITIES IN THE

00:25:27.792 --> 00:25:31.129

THANK YOU VERY MUCH --

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.066
A HUMAN ARE PROBABLY FAMILIAR

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:36.134
WITH THE MEDALLION SYSTEM THAT

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:37.402
IS UNIQUE TO SAN FRANCISCO IN

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.337
MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS THAT IS

00:25:39.404 --> 00:25:40.305
NOT THE SAME CASE THROUGHOUT THE

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.973
ENTIRE STATE SO.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:42.974
OF THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.509
CHALLENGES WITH RESPECT TO THAT

00:25:44.576 --> 00:25:45.477
OF THE PROPERTY.

00:25:45.543 --> 00:25:47.846
OF THE CITY COUNTY OF SAN

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:50.649

00:25:51.216 --> 00:25:52.183
TECHNICAL.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.919
SO THE MEDALLION SYSTEM MEN'S

00:25:53.985 --> 00:25:55.520
AND SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.855
CONSIDERED AN ACTUAL BUT WHEN

AND SO ANY CHANGES TO THE MOUNT

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.062
MEDALLION SYSTEM --

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:05.630
INSIDE AND SAN FRANCISCO WOULD

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:08.800
UPSET THAT PROCESS AND IN THE

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.303
CITY BACKS THE LOANS THAT THE

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.971
SPECIFIC CREDIT UNIONS.

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:17.943
PROVIDE FOR THE MEDALLION AND SO.

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:19.577
ANY CHANGE TO THAT SYSTEM WOULD

00:26:19.644 --> 00:26:21.513
IMPACT THE CITY AND THE CITY

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:24.182
BUDGETS AND REVENUES AND SO WE

00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:25.517

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:27.519
WORMS AND SAN FRANCISCO HAD

00:26:27.585 --> 00:26:29.955

00:26:38.096 --> 00:26:39.230
TO RESPECT SOME OF THOSE

00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:40.732
REGIONAL DIFFERENCES --

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:42.968
AND THE WAY WE DRAFTED THE

00:26:43.034 --> 00:26:44.736

00:26:54.412 --> 00:26:56.247
SAN FRANCISCO REMAINED EXEMPT
