AT THE TIME HE MURDERED KATE.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:05.675

PROFOUND IMPACTS TO NOT JUST MY

BECAUSE OF KATE'S MURDER AND THE

00:54:35.538 --> 00:54:36.806
NUMEROUS OTHER MURDERS AND

00:54:36.873 --> 00:54:38.842
VIOLENT CRIMES TAKING PLACE EACH

00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:40.744
WEEK IN OUR STATE THE ENTIRE

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.779

SAFE FROM VIOLENT PREDATORS EVEN

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:47.617
IN OUR OWN HOMES. LATELY ALL TOO

00:54:47.684 --> 00:54:50.053
OFTEN CONVICTED FELONS ARE BEING

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.155
RELEASED EARLY FROM PRISON ON

00:54:52.222 --> 00:54:54.324
PAROLE. HER ROLE IS BASICALLY AN

00:54:54.391 --> 00:54:55.291
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

00:54:55.358 --> 00:54:58.128
GOVERNMENTS GOVERNANCESYSTEM

00:54:58.194 --> 00:55:00.130
AND A VIOLENT CONDUCT THAT SAYS.

00:55:00.196 --> 00:55:01.898
OKAY YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF WHILE

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:04.100
BEING INCARCERATED WILL LET YOU

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:11.574
MANY TIMES HIGH RISK PAROLEES DO

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.476
NOT BEHAVE THEMSELVES

00:55:13.543 --> 00:55:14.978
UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS A VERY

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:16.680
DEFICIENT STRUCTURE TO HOLD THEM

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.081
ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY

00:55:18.148 --> 00:55:19.282
INTENTIONALLY VIOLATE THEIR

00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:21.818
PAROLE. AND THIS IS EVEN MORE

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.853
APPARENT IF THE PAROLE THE

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.256
HAPPENS TO BE TRANSIENT. K.

00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:27.590
TIBBETTS ACT WOULD REQUIRE

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:30.226
TRANSIENT HIGH RISK PAROLEES TO

00:55:30.293 --> 00:55:32.128
WEAR AN ANKLE MONITORING DEVICE

00:55:32.195 --> 00:55:34.197
SO THAT IF AND WHEN THEY VIOLATE

TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY THIS

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.209
MORNING S. N. MEMBERS WHAT WE'RE

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:23.110
ASKING FOR AN AB SIXTY NO EIGHT

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:24.979
IS A COMMONSENSE REFORMS THAT

01:31:25.046 --> 01:31:26.113
INCREASES TRANSPARENCY

01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.816
ACCOUNTABILITY- AND OBJECTIVITY

01:31:28.883 --> 01:31:31.953
IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING A

01:31:32.019 --> 01:31:33.287
DEATH. THAT IS QUESTIONABLE.

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:34.956
THAT IS A PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE

01:31:35.022 --> 01:31:36.958
DETERMINED BY A MEDICAL

01:31:37.024 --> 01:31:38.492
PROFESSIONAL AND NOT AN ELECTED

01:31:38.559 --> 01:31:39.627
OFFICIAL THAT HAS NO MEDICAL

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:41.395
TRAINING. THIS IS REALLY

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:44.098
IMPORTANT AT A TIME WHEN WE- WE

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:46.000
CERTAINLY HAD QUESTIONS AS SOON

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.902
AS OUR LAWYER TOLD US THAT WE

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.170
SHOULD GET AN INDEPENDENT

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.338
PATHOLOGIST. BUT I THINK IN THIS

01:31:50.404 --> 01:31:51.939
SOCIETY IN GENERAL YOU'RE SEEING

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.307
THAT EVERYONE WANTS AN

01:31:53.374 --> 01:31:53.941
INDEPENDENT PATHOLOGIST BECAUSE

01:31:54.008 --> 01:31:55.409
THERE'S NO TRUST IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:57.511
A. N. INTO THAT SEPARATION IN

01:31:57.578 --> 01:31:59.180
THAT OBJECTIVITY BECAUSE THE

01:31:59.247 --> 01:32:00.248
SHERIFF OVERSEAS IN FORTY EIGHT

01:32:00.314 --> 01:32:02.817
COUNTIES. WHAT THE OP WHAT THE

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.819
CORNER CONFINED AND SO THIS IS

01:32:04.886 --> 01:32:06.354
REALLY A COMMONSENSE REFORM WHAT

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.622
WE'RE ASKING FOR IS SOMETHING

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:09.023
THAT INCREASES ACCOUNTABILITY

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.192
TRANSPARENCY AND OBJECTIVITY

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:13.227
AND- AND IT'S A GOOD GOVERNMENT

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:14.896
INITIATIVE IT BASICALLY SAYS WE

01:32:14.962 --> 01:32:16.297
CAN TRUST THE GOVERNMENT BECAUSE

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.733
THE- YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:32:18.799 --> 01:32:20.568
DOES NOT. SHOULD NOT INVESTIGATE

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.370
ITSELF WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING AT

01:32:22.436 --> 01:32:24.238
ISSUE SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:32:24.305 --> 01:32:25.673
IS REALLY I THINK I COMMONSENSE

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.341
REFORM IT JUST TAKES OUT WHO IS

01:32:27.408 --> 01:32:28.175
THE TOP PERSON THAT'S MAKING

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:29.710
THAT DETERMINATION. AND IN

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:32.013
INSTEAD IT IT JUST MEANS THAT

01:32:32.079 --> 01:32:33.381
SOMEBODY WOULD AS SCIENTIFIC

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:34.215

TYPICALLY DON'T WANT TO SEE A

02:19:11.376 --> 02:19:11.976
LOT OF WORDS ON SOMETHING THAT I

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:14.345

02:19:14.412 --> 02:19:15.814

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:16.815
APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION HAVE

02:19:16.881 --> 02:19:17.982

WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST- AND I

HAD TO SAY THAT BUT I DON'T

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:29.961
AGREE BECAUSE- THESE GUNS HAVE

02:19:30.028 --> 02:19:31.896
NO PLACE ON THE STREETS.

02:19:31.963 --> 02:19:34.332
SOMEBODY'S GUNS WERE BUILT. THE

02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:36.101
MASS DESTROYS SOMEBODY'S GUNS

02:19:36.167 --> 02:19:39.370
WERE AT THE CONCEPT OF CREATING

02:19:39.437 --> 02:19:41.973
PARTS THAT ARE UNDETECTABLE SO

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:44.008
THAT THEY CAN BE PUT TOGETHER IN

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:46.277
A DIFFERENT LOCATION STILL UNDER

02:19:46.344 --> 02:19:50.648
INTACT THE BOWL. TO MAKE A GUN

02:19:50.715 --> 02:19:54.385
THAT UNDETECTABLE. THAT IS BUILT

02:19:54.452 --> 02:19:56.121
WITH THE IF IT WOULD WITH THE

02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:58.022
INTENT OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO ME

02:19:58.089 --> 02:20:00.325
MAKES NO SENSE FOR US TONIGHT I

02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:01.960
MEAN LET LET ALONE HAVE A BUT WE

02:20:02.026 --> 02:20:04.095
CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE DOWN THE

02:20:04.162 --> 02:20:05.663
LINE FOR THEM TO EXIST FOR THEM

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.098
TO HAVE THEM FOR THE AVERAGE

02:20:07.165 --> 02:20:08.433
CITIZEN TO BE WALK AROUND THE

02:20:08.500 --> 02:20:09.934
STREET OWNING ONE OF THESE GUNS.

02:20:10.001 --> 02:20:12.170
FOR MASS DESTRUCTION OF WE'VE

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:13.571
DONE A LOT IN CALIFORNIA BUT BUT

02:20:13.638 --> 02:20:14.472
THE RIVER THE REALITY WE REMAINS

02:20:14.539 --> 02:20:16.107
AND UNLESS WE GET COMPREHENSIVE.

02:20:16.174 --> 02:20:17.242
GUN CONTROL MEASURES AT THE

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:18.543
NATIONAL LEVEL PEOPLE CAN STILL

02:20:18.610 --> 02:20:20.812
GO OUT OF STATE GET ONE BRING IT

02:20:20.879 --> 02:20:22.213
BACK AGAIN. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:23.882
ME TO HAVE A GUN LIKE THAT OR

02:20:23.948 --> 02:20:25.850
WHY SOMEBODY WOULD WANT TO HAVE

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:27.585
ONE W. AS IT MAY THE CONCEPT

02:20:27.652 --> 02:20:31.422
ALONE OF HAVING A GUN LIKE THIS

02:20:31.489 --> 02:20:32.390
IT IS UNTRACEABLE. IT IS

02:20:32.457 --> 02:20:34.592
UNCONSCIONABLE TO ME THAT WE

02:20:34.659 --> 02:20:35.860
WILL EVEN HAVE. A DEBATE ABOUT

02:20:35.927 --> 02:20:39.497
TRACING A GUN. L. A. N. I

02:20:39.564 --> 02:20:41.733
UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT ABOUT YOU

02:20:41.800 --> 02:20:43.701
KNOW WE SHOULD FOCUS ON. ON

02:20:43.768 --> 02:20:46.337
PEOPLE NOT GUNS BUT A PERSON IS

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:48.540
NOT GOING TO GET UP AND SHOOT

02:20:48.606 --> 02:20:49.140
SOMEBODY WITH A GUN. SO OF

02:20:49.207 --> 02:20:51.442
COURSE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE

02:20:51.509 --> 02:20:53.444
GUY YOU WANT ELIMINATE A LARGE

02:20:53.511 --> 02:20:54.112
PORTION OF THE EQUATION OF WHAT

02:20:54.179 --> 02:20:56.714
KILLED SOMEBODY WITH A GUN YOU

02:20:56.781 --> 02:20:58.883
HAVE TO LIMIT THE GUN WE EAT WE

02:20:58.950 --> 02:21:00.518
CAN VIEW IT DIFFERENTLY BUT THE

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:02.120
OTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:04.355
LOGIC STILL STANDS. YOU DON'T

02:21:04.422 --> 02:21:05.890
GET UP TO SHOOT SOMEBODY WITH A

02:21:05.957 --> 02:21:07.759
GUN AND HURT THEM UNLESS THE GUN

02:21:07.826 --> 02:21:09.727
IS PRESENT. GIVEN THE JUST NO

02:21:09.794 --> 02:21:11.996
SHOT THAT'S THE LOGIC. SO WE CAN

02:21:12.063 --> 02:21:14.098
DO. SO WE COULD BE THERE ALL DAY

02:21:14.165 --> 02:21:16.601
LONG BUT THE END OF THE DAY WE

02:21:16.668 --> 02:21:17.168
NEED. THE STRONGEST CONTROL

02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:19.637
CONTROL MEASURES. ON THE STREETS

02:21:19.704 --> 02:21:20.939
TO PREVENT. PEOPLE FROM GETTING

02:21:21.005 --> 02:21:23.808
SHOT OR PEOPLE FROM SHOOTING.

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:24.876
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. SO I

02:21:24.943 --> 02:21:26.978
WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR

02:21:27.045 --> 02:21:28.613

NOVEL IN A COUPLE OF DAYS AND

02:55:06.896 --> 02:55:09.532
BECAME SO DESPERATE TO TALKING

02:55:09.599 --> 02:55:10.099
HERE SOUND. THAT WOULD ASK

02:55:10.166 --> 02:55:11.734
MYSELF QUESTIONS AND THEN

02:55:11.801 --> 02:55:13.936
RESPOND OUT LOUD. I WOULD ALSO

02:55:14.003 --> 02:55:15.671
RECITE EVERY MEMORY THAT I COULD

02:55:15.738 --> 02:55:18.207
REMEMBER SENSE BIRTH JUST AS A

02:55:18.274 --> 02:55:20.076
WAY TO GET MY MIND TO DO

02:55:20.142 --> 02:55:21.510
SOMETHING. SOMETIMES I WOULD

02:55:21.577 --> 02:55:22.945
JUST SIT THERE AND CRY OUT OF

02:55:23.012 --> 02:55:24.213
FRUSTRATION. ALL GOING TO SPEND

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:26.182
A TOTAL OF TWENTY THREE MONTHS

02:55:26.249 --> 02:55:27.149
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BEFORE I

02:55:27.216 --> 02:55:29.051
WAS PAROLED. BUT NOT BEFORE I

02:55:29.118 --> 02:55:30.653
SAW TWO PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE IN

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:33.422
SOLITARY IN MANY OTHERS MAKE

02:55:33.489 --> 02:55:35.725
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. ONCE I WAS OUT

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:36.859
I FELT SO MUCH ANGER AND

02:55:36.926 --> 02:55:38.661
ANIMOSITY ESPECIALLY TOWARDS

02:55:38.728 --> 02:55:41.330
FIGURES OF AUTHORITY. I AVOIDED

02:55:41.397 --> 02:55:42.565
PEOPLE AND DID NOT LIKE TALKING

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:44.567
TO ANYONE. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT

02:55:44.634 --> 02:55:46.269
IS A VICIOUS ASSAULT UPON ONE'S

02:55:46.335 --> 02:55:49.105
PSYCHE AND SOUL. IT IS A FORM OF

02:55:49.171 --> 02:55:50.773
SPIRITUAL EMOTIONAL AND

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:53.142
PSYCHOLOGICAL TORTURE. HOW CAN

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:54.911
WE PROHIBIT PHYSICAL VIOLENCE

02:55:54.977 --> 02:55:56.812
UNDER THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT BUT

02:55:56.879 --> 02:55:57.980
NOT STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST THE

02:55:58.047 --> 02:56:00.116
MINE. I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED A

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:02.118
PHYSICAL BEATING IN LIEU OF

02:56:02.184 --> 02:56:03.486
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. BRUISES

02:56:03.552 --> 02:56:05.521

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:06.956
ONES IN MY MIND AND SOUL HAVE

02:56:07.023 --> 02:56:08.457
ONLY BECOME INFECTED AND

02:56:08.524 --> 02:56:11.093
CONTINUE TO HARM ME. WHEN I WAS

02:56:11.160 --> 02:56:12.561
IN SOLITARY THE GUARD'S FAVORITE

02:56:12.628 --> 02:56:15.197
RESPONSE WAS THEY DON'T MAKE THE

02:56:15.264 --> 02:56:16.666
LAW THEY JUST FOLLOW IT. THIS

02:56:16.732 --> 02:56:19.402
LEGISLATURE MAKES THE LAW AND

02:56:19.468 --> 02:56:20.569
HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STOP

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:23.005

ALSO AS PROOF THAT PEOPLE CAN

02:56:31.080 --> 02:56:32.381
CHANGE THEIR LIVES. THERE IS

02:56:32.448 --> 02:56:34.350
NOTHING THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO

02:56:34.417 --> 02:56:36.719
RESTORE ME AND OTHER VICTIMS OF

02:56:36.786 --> 02:56:39.622
SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. BUT THIS

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:41.090
LEGISLATURE CAN PROTECT FUTURE

FOR OUR OFFICERS AND THE INMATES

02:58:39.742 --> 02:58:42.912

OF THE INVOLUNTARY PLACEMENTS IN

02:58:57.827 --> 02:58:58.727
FORCING THE DEPARTMENT TO

AT SERIOUS RISK OF HARM. THAT

02:59:08.003 --> 02:59:09.472
POTENTIAL RISK ONLY INCREASES

02:59:09.538 --> 02:59:11.040
WITH THE BILL MAXIMIZING ITS USE

02:59:11.107 --> 02:59:13.042

EFFECTIVE USE NO MATTER THE

02:59:22.218 --> 02:59:23.552
REASON FOR PLACEMENT. WHEN

INTO THE POPULATION TO WHICH

02:59:41.337 --> 02:59:42.972
THEY POSE A RISK. AS FAR AS OUR

02:59:43.038 --> 02:59:45.074
OFFICERS ARE CONCERNED EVEN WHEN

02:59:45.141 --> 02:59:46.242
TACK ATTACKS ARE NOT DIRECTED AT

02:59:46.308 --> 02:59:47.843
THE OFFICERS. ANY VIOLENCE

02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:49.778
WITHIN A PRISON FACILITY POSES A

02:59:49.845 --> 02:59:50.813
DANGER TO THEM WHEN THEY

02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:52.381
INTERVENE. IT STANDS TO REASON

02:59:52.448 --> 02:59:53.782
THAT REMOVING EXCEPTIONALLY

02:59:53.849 --> 02:59:55.084

02:59:57.686 --> 02:59:58.787
GENERALLY STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:59:58.854 --> 03:00:00.256

TROUBLING RESULT OF AB TWENTY

03:00:04.393 --> 03:00:05.394

AGAINST KNOWN THREATS TO THEIR

03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:13.335
LIVES. THE BILL ONLY ALLOWS FOR

03:00:13.402 --> 03:00:14.837
PLACEMENT INTO ANOTHER UNIT OR

03:00:14.904 --> 03:00:16.705
AREA OF THE FACILITY. THIS MAY

03:00:16.772 --> 03:00:18.040
BE FOR THAT SUFFICIENT IN SOME

03:00:18.107 --> 03:00:20.142
CASES BUT IF AN INMATE HAS BEEN

03:00:20.209 --> 03:00:21.110
DESIGNATED BY PRESENTING TO BE

03:00:21.177 --> 03:00:22.978
KILLED. MOVING INTO ANOTHER AREA

03:00:23.045 --> 03:00:25.481
OF THE PRISON IS FAR FROM A

03:00:25.548 --> 03:00:26.582
GUARANTEE OF PROTECTION.

03:00:26.649 --> 03:00:27.850
UNFORTUNATELY THE REGION

03:00:27.917 --> 03:00:29.652
INFLUENCE OF SOME PRISON GNGS

03:00:29.718 --> 03:00:30.219
WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE THE

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:32.221
PERSON AT RISK. IT WILL NOT TAKE

03:00:32.288 --> 03:00:33.923
LONG FOR THE ORDER TO SPREAD

03:00:33.989 --> 03:00:34.924
THROUGHOUT THE PRISON IN IN MANY

CIRCUMSTANCES SEGREGATED

03:00:36.492 --> 03:00:37.893
CONFINEMENT IS THE ONLY WAY TO

03:00:37.960 --> 03:00:39.728
ENSURE THEIR PROTECTION. IN THIS

03:00:39.795 --> 03:00:41.063
BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THAT EVEN AT

03:00:41.130 --> 03:00:43.332

GREAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY. BUT

03:10:54.543 --> 03:10:56.578
THERE'S A FEW INDIVIDUALS WHO I

03:10:56.645 --> 03:10:58.747
THINK. YOU KNOW PEOPLE OF KILTER

03:10:58.814 --> 03:11:01.583
CELLMATE OUR PEOPLE ARE GENERAL

03:11:01.650 --> 03:11:03.752
AND DE DANGER OF GENERAL

03:11:03.819 --> 03:11:11.026
POPULATION WHERE- HEY. THERE'S I

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:12.060
THINK THEY HAVE TO HAVE SPECIAL

03:11:12.127 --> 03:11:15.664
COULD. AND WALLET IN THEORY THAT

03:11:15.730 --> 03:11:16.798

HOPEFULLY NEVER BUT I DO THINK

03:11:42.891 --> 03:11:46.661

IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT.

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:19.127

WE THINK SOME APPROPRIATE

03:15:00.755 --> 03:15:02.457
STANDARDS IN PLACE THAT MAYOR

THAT THE REAL PROBLEM. IT IS NOT

03:15:23.678 --> 03:15:26.181
REALLY SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. IS

03:15:26.247 --> 03:15:28.550
THE ABUSE OF SOLITARY

03:15:28.616 --> 03:15:31.486
CONFINEMENT BY BOTH THE PRISON

GUARDS. NCDC ARE MANAGEMENT

03:15:34.889 --> 03:15:37.525
WHICH DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT. THE

03:15:37.592 --> 03:15:42.330
LONG STANDING. HARM BED IT DOES

03:15:42.397 --> 03:15:44.699
TO PRISONERS. BECAUSE I DON'T

03:15:44.766 --> 03:15:48.103
THINK THEY CARE. AND WHEN THEY

03:15:48.169 --> 03:15:50.672
DECIDED TO GO TO PUT SOMEBODY IN

MACHINE GUN. WHICH IS HIGHLY

04:45:30.746 --> 04:45:33.416
ILLEGAL I THOUGHT IF IT WAS USED

IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME

04:45:35.051 --> 04:45:36.352

04:46:51.060 --> 04:46:52.995
SOMEONE WHO KNOWINGLY RECEIVES

OR BUYS A STOLEN FIREARM THAT'S

04:46:55.164 --> 04:46:57.433
IF THERE IS ANOTHER UNDERLYING

ARE TO AGREE AS THE COMEDIAN

04:47:03.439 --> 04:47:05.274
ALSO POINTS OUT THAT ALL GUN

04:47:05.341 --> 04:47:07.043
CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED AS

04:47:07.109 --> 04:47:09.045
SERIOUS THERE ARE SITUATIONS

04:47:09.111 --> 04:47:10.246
WHERE THERE IS NO UNDERLYING

04:47:10.313 --> 04:47:13.215
CRIME WHEN THEY WOULD KNOWINGLY

04:47:13.282 --> 04:47:15.651
BUY OR RECEIVE A STOLEN FIREARM.

04:47:15.718 --> 04:47:18.154

A BILL THAT THAT MR GIPSON A

04:47:24.627 --> 04:47:25.995
PRESENTED EARLIER ON THE ON THE-

04:47:26.062 --> 04:47:27.863
BANNING MOST GUNS I BELIEVE THAT

04:47:27.930 --> 04:47:28.998
THAT'S ANOTHER PROSE THAT WE

04:47:29.065 --> 04:47:31.167
NEED TO TAKE I MAY DISAGREE WITH

04:47:31.233 --> 04:47:32.101
SOME OF THE SUPPORTERS ALL. OF

04:47:32.168 --> 04:47:34.070
THIS BILL ON THAT POINT BUT- YOU

04:47:34.136 --> 04:47:35.972

04:47:36.038 --> 04:47:38.708
DOWN TO YOU KNOW IF WE ARE TO

04:47:38.774 --> 04:47:40.876

LAWS THERE NEED TO BE

04:47:42.545 --> 04:47:44.547
CONSEQUENCES SO. YOU KNOW WE SAW

TIMES ARTICLE- STATING YOU KNOW

04:47:48.384 --> 04:47:50.353
THE FACT THAT- THE NUMBER OF

04:47:50.419 --> 04:47:52.188
MISDEMEANOR CRIMINAL CHARGES

04:47:52.254 --> 04:47:54.090
FILED BY THE CURRENT DISTRICT

04:47:54.156 --> 04:47:55.658
ATTORNEY IS HALF OF WHAT WAS

04:47:55.725 --> 04:47:57.827

THE CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT APPROACH

04:48:06.636 --> 04:48:10.239
FAILING YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL

04:48:10.306 --> 04:48:12.475
AGREE THAT- CRIMINAL STATISTICS

04:48:12.541 --> 04:48:14.510
ARE ARE MORE COMPLICATED- IT'S

04:48:14.577 --> 04:48:16.278
HARD TO DETERMINE CAUSE AND

04:48:16.345 --> 04:48:18.114
EFFECT. YOU KNOW JUST LIK IT'S

04:48:18.180 --> 04:48:20.383
HARD TO SAY. THE RECENT INCREASE

04:48:20.449 --> 04:48:22.818
IN VIOLENT. CRIMES IS A

04:48:22.885 --> 04:48:24.587
REFLECTION OF THE FAILURE OF

04:48:24.654 --> 04:48:32.328
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I MEAN.

04:48:32.395 --> 04:48:34.797

ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME

04:48:39.802 --> 04:48:40.836
WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT I

04:48:40.903 --> 04:48:42.872
THINK YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE

04:48:42.938 --> 04:48:43.572
TALKING ABOUT KNOWINGLY

04:48:43.639 --> 04:48:46.409
RECEIVING STOLEN FIREARM.

04:48:46.475 --> 04:48:49.178
STANDING IN AND OF ITSELF. THE

NOW IS PART OF THE DRUG SUPPLY

05:23:25.719 --> 05:23:27.020
NOW AND FOCUSING ON

05:23:27.087 --> 05:23:28.188
CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE WHO SELL

05:23:28.255 --> 05:23:29.389

05:23:29.456 --> 05:23:30.958
GOING TO STOP DRUG USE OR DRUG

05:23:31.024 --> 05:23:32.993

05:23:33.060 --> 05:23:34.762
GOING TO FIX THE DRUG SUPPLY.

05:23:34.828 --> 05:23:37.164

JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IN

05:23:50.077 --> 05:23:52.079
CALIFORNIA. THE LEGISLATURE

05:23:52.146 --> 05:23:54.214
URGENTLY NEEDS TO ACT WHAT WE

05:23:54.281 --> 05:23:56.049
SEE ON THE GROUND IS THAT HARM

05:23:56.116 --> 05:23:57.518
REDUCTION WORKS AND I DON'T JUST

05:23:57.584 --> 05:23:58.952
MEAN IN TERMS OF DISEASE

05:23:59.019 --> 05:24:00.254
PREVENTION. THE PRINCIPLES AND

05:24:00.320 --> 05:24:01.188
PRACTICES OF HARM REDUCTION CAN

05:24:01.255 --> 05:24:02.890
BE INCORPORATED INTO OUR

CONTINUE- AND KEEP PEOPLE WHO

05:24:08.962 --> 05:24:10.564
USE DRUGS ALIVE. WHETHER THEY'RE

05:24:10.631 --> 05:24:12.299
HABITUAL USERS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE

05:24:12.366 --> 05:24:13.901
EXPERIMENTING WITH DRUGS FOR THE

05:24:13.967 --> 05:24:15.402
FIRST TIME. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT

05:24:15.469 --> 05:24:17.137
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO DRUG

05:24:17.204 --> 05:24:18.839
EDUCATION THAT IS EVIDENCE BASED

05:24:18.906 --> 05:24:21.108
AND DOESN'T ONLY ENCOURAGE THEM

05:24:21.175 --> 05:24:22.242
TO AVOID DRUGS. IT MUST ALSO

05:24:22.309 --> 05:24:24.878
PROVIDE INFORMATION ON HOW THEY

05:24:24.945 --> 05:24:26.380
CAN REDUCE RISK. THEY NEED

05:24:26.446 --> 05:24:28.148
SOMEONE THEY CAN BE HONEST ABOUT

05:24:28.215 --> 05:24:29.416
WHAT'S GOING ON FOR THEM WHO CAN

05:24:29.483 --> 05:24:31.318
PROVIDE STIGMA FREE SUPPORT. I

05:24:31.385 --> 05:24:32.186
HAVE TWO SMALL CHILDREN AND

05:24:32.252 --> 05:24:34.454
BELIEVE ME I DO NOT HOPE FOR

05:24:34.521 --> 05:24:36.456
THEM TO END UP. DRUG DEPENDENT

05:24:36.523 --> 05:24:37.891
THE WAY I WAS. I NOW UNDERSTAND

05:24:37.958 --> 05:24:40.460
THE GUT WRENCHING WORRYMY MOM

05:24:40.527 --> 05:24:41.028

05:24:41.094 --> 05:24:43.197

05:24:43.263 --> 05:24:45.132
POWERLESS. SHE ABSOLUTELY WOULD

05:24:45.199 --> 05:24:47.167

05:25:08.021 --> 05:25:09.022
DIFFERENCES IN DRUG SUPPLY-

05:25:09.089 --> 05:25:10.924

HONESTLY WITH ABOUT MY USE. WELL

05:25:16.630 --> 05:25:18.365
MANDATED TREATMENT RARELY WORKS

05:25:18.432 --> 05:25:19.666
WE KNOW FROM BEING ON THE GROUND

05:25:19.733 --> 05:25:21.001
WITH DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS

05:25:21.068 --> 05:25:22.336
AND PEOPLE WHO USE DRUGS THAT

05:25:22.402 --> 05:25:24.238
TREATMENT IS STILL NOT READILY

05:25:24.304 --> 05:25:25.372
AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE. WHO DO

05:25:25.439 --> 05:25:27.774
WANT IT AS PART OF MY WORK IN

05:25:27.841 --> 05:25:28.809
CALIFORNIA WE PROVIDED GRANT

05:25:28.876 --> 05:25:30.711
FUNDING TO THIRTY SEVEN HARM

05:25:30.777 --> 05:25:32.012
REDUCTION PROGRAMS TO EXPAND

05:25:32.079 --> 05:25:33.380
STAFFING FOR NAVIGATION TO

05:25:33.447 --> 05:25:35.515
TREATMENT. WE ADVOCATED FOR THIS

05:25:35.582 --> 05:25:36.583
FUNDING ALONG WITH THE

05:25:36.650 --> 05:25:38.318
CALIFORNIA SYRINGE EXCHANGE

05:25:38.385 --> 05:25:40.387
PROGRAM COALITION. AFTER HEARING

05:25:40.454 --> 05:25:41.388
FROM PROGRAM FOR. THAT THEY

05:25:41.455 --> 05:25:43.156
COULD NOT ACCESS TREATMENT WHEN

05:25:43.223 --> 05:25:45.359
THEY WANTED IT. TODAY TWO YEARS

05:25:45.425 --> 05:25:47.160
AND REFERRALS AND LINKAGES TO

05:25:47.227 --> 05:25:47.995
TREATMENT HAVE TRIPLED. HARM

05:25:48.061 --> 05:25:49.296
REDUCTION APPROACHES LIKE THIS

05:25:49.363 --> 05:25:50.898
INITIATIVE COULD BE SCALED UP TO

05:25:50.964 --> 05:25:53.533
MEET THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE AT ANY

05:25:53.600 --> 05:25:54.935
STAGE OF DRUG USE. WE ALSO KNOW

05:25:55.002 --> 05:25:56.336
THAT WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS DONE A

05:25:56.403 --> 05:25:58.672
LOT OF WORK TO MAKE NALOXONE

05:25:58.739 --> 05:25:59.973
ACCESSIBLE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO

05:26:00.040 --> 05:26:01.875
GO TO A LINE WITH NALOXONE

05:26:01.942 --> 05:26:02.943
DISTRIBUTION BEST PRACTICES.

05:26:03.010 --> 05:26:04.511
RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT COMMUNITY

05:26:04.578 --> 05:26:07.147
SATURATION OF NALOXONE REDUCES

05:26:07.214 --> 05:26:08.415
OVERDOSE DEATH. I WAS VISITING

05:26:08.482 --> 05:26:10.550
SOME PROGRAMS IN SAN DIEGO LAST

05:26:10.617 --> 05:26:11.351
WEEKEND PARTICIPANTS THERE

05:26:11.418 --> 05:26:13.186
REPORTED HAVING TO USE MULTIPLE

05:26:13.253 --> 05:26:15.155
DOSES OF NALOXONE TO REVERSE AN

05:26:15.222 --> 05:26:17.257
OVERDOSE. DUE TO THE POTENCY OF

05:26:17.324 --> 05:26:18.926
THE LOCAL DRUG SUPPLY. THESE

05:26:18.992 --> 05:26:20.794
INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO GET THE

05:26:20.861 --> 05:26:22.296
SUPPLIES THEY NEEDED TO KEEP

05:26:22.362 --> 05:26:23.397
THEMSELVES AND THEIR COMMUNITY

05:26:23.463 --> 05:26:25.532
SAFE. BUT THIS IS NOT. IN EVERY

05:26:25.599 --> 05:26:27.200
COUNTY AND EVEN IN COUNTY STROP

05:26:27.267 --> 05:26:28.535
OVERDOSE PREVENTION AND

05:26:28.602 --> 05:26:31.004
EDUCATION PROGRMS. THERE ARE

05:26:31.071 --> 05:26:31.872
STILL MAJOR GAPS IN

05:26:31.939 --> 05:26:33.907
AVAILABILITY. SOME THIS IS ABOUT

05:26:33.974 --> 05:26:35.609
SUPPLY AND FUNDING BUT SOME OF

05:26:35.676 --> 05:26:37.044
IT IS ABOUT MISINFORMATION AND

05:26:37.110 --> 05:26:38.712
STIGMA. THE SAME DAY IN SAN

05:26:38.779 --> 05:26:40.247
DIEGO I TALKED TO SOME PROVIDERS

05:26:40.314 --> 05:26:41.848
WHO ARE MISINFORMED ABOUT THE

05:26:41.915 --> 05:26:43.784
LAWS AROUND THE LOCKS OWN. AND

05:26:43.850 --> 05:26:44.318
CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDER

05:26:44.384 --> 05:26:45.919
LIABILITY AND THEREFORE WE'RE

05:26:45.986 --> 05:26:48.322
RESTRICTING HOW AND WHEN IT WAS

05:26:48.388 --> 05:26:48.889
DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS AND

05:26:48.956 --> 05:26:51.124
COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WE NEED ANTI

05:26:51.191 --> 05:26:52.993
STICK. EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS

05:26:53.060 --> 05:26:54.328
FOCUSED ON OVERDOSE PREVENTION

05:26:54.394 --> 05:26:56.063
AND WE NEED TO SCALE UP NALOXONE

05:26:56.129 --> 05:26:58.165
ACCESS. AND DISTRIBUTION TO

05:26:58.231 --> 05:26:59.466
SATURATE EVERY COMMUNITY WITH

05:26:59.533 --> 05:27:01.601
THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION. TIME

05:27:01.668 --> 05:27:04.171
IS A- GOOD. FINISH UP THE LAST

05:27:04.237 --> 05:27:06.139
TIME I WENT TO DRUG TREATMENT I

05:27:06.206 --> 05:27:07.541
WENT VOLUNTARILY TO A REHAB

05:27:07.607 --> 05:27:09.409
PROGRAM IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND I

05:27:09.476 --> 05:27:11.278
AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THAT PROGRAM

05:27:11.345 --> 05:27:12.713
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN AND WE

05:27:12.779 --> 05:27:14.381
BECAUSE- WE COVER EVER SINCE.

05:27:14.448 --> 05:27:15.882
BUT THE REALITY FOR THE MAJORITY

05:27:15.949 --> 05:27:17.217
OF THOSE WHO I WENT TO TREATMENT

05:27:17.284 --> 05:27:19.386
WITH WAS THAT THEY WERE NOT

05:27:19.453 --> 05:27:20.921
READY OR THE ABSTINENCE MODEL

05:27:20.988 --> 05:27:21.555
DIDN'T WORK FOR THEM. A LOT OF

05:27:21.621 --> 05:27:22.823
THEM GOT KICKED OUT OF TREATMENT

05:27:22.889 --> 05:27:24.591
AND WENT OUT INTO A COMMUNITY

05:27:24.658 --> 05:27:25.993
THAT HAD NO HARM REDUCTION

05:27:26.059 --> 05:27:26.960
SERVICES THEY SHARED SYRINGES

05:27:27.027 --> 05:27:28.628
THEY OVERDOSED AND DIED THEY GOT

05:27:28.695 --> 05:27:30.230
TREATMENT TREATED TERRIBLY BY

05:27:30.297 --> 05:27:32.332
POLICE AND EMTS WHEN THEY WERE

05:27:32.399 --> 05:27:34.234
LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET REVIVED.

05:27:34.301 --> 05:27:35.936
THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO NALOXONE

05:27:36.003 --> 05:27:39.873
AND NO TO MEET THE WHERE THEYWERE WITH THEIR USE. THE REALITY

05:27:39.940 --> 05:27:41.208
IS THAT WE DO KNOW STRATEGIES TO

05:27:41.274 --> 05:27:42.509
CURB OVERDOSE TO OVERDOSE DEATHS

05:27:42.576 --> 05:27:44.444
AND HARSHER SENTENCING IS NOT

05:27:44.511 --> 05:27:46.513
ONE OF THEM. IT ONLY CONTRIBUTES

05:27:46.580 --> 05:27:47.547
TO THE HARMS PEOPLE NAVIGATING

05:27:47.614 --> 05:27:49.616
SYSTEMS FACE WITH AN UNREGULATED

05:27:49.683 --> 05:27:51.518
DRUG SUPPLY INTERNALIZED AN

05:27:51.585 --> 05:27:53.353
EXTERNAL STIGMA. AND A FRACTURED

05:27:53.420 --> 05:27:55.055
MEDICAL CARE AND TREATMENT

05:27:55.122 --> 05:27:56.590

05:27:56.656 --> 05:27:58.925

WITH PLEASE AND OUR INTERACTIONS

05:28:00.327 --> 05:28:01.428
BUT WE KNOW THAT IT'S MORE

05:28:01.495 --> 05:28:02.863
LIKELY THAT GRIEF STORIES START

05:28:02.929 --> 05:28:04.498
THERE THAT PEOPLE DIE IN CUSTODY

05:28:04.564 --> 05:28:07.901
LIKE THE MOM GREETING HER CHILD

05:28:07.968 --> 05:28:08.902

SECONDLY I WOULD LIKE TO SAY

05:32:46.546 --> 05:32:49.182
THAT. IT OFFENSIVE TO HEAR THE

05:32:49.249 --> 05:32:51.151
SUB POISONING REFERRED TO AS

05:32:51.217 --> 05:32:54.154
OVERDOSE. I DON'T THINK YOU

05:32:54.220 --> 05:32:56.256
MEANT TO INSULT BUT I WILL TELL

YOU THAT IT IS AN INSULT BECAUSE

05:32:58.291 --> 05:33:00.493
IT IS A POISONING THERE'S A

05:33:00.560 --> 05:33:01.494
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POISONING

05:33:01.561 --> 05:33:05.665
AND OVERDOSE. AND I JUST HAVING

05:33:05.732 --> 05:33:07.334

HARD TRYING TO MY BEST TO

05:33:16.476 --> 05:33:18.378

05:33:27.287 --> 05:33:28.521
TRAVESTY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

05:33:28.588 --> 05:33:30.757
AND IT'S HAPPENING AT SUCH AN

05:33:30.824 --> 05:33:32.859
ALARMING RATE. YET WE DO'T HAVE

05:33:32.926 --> 05:33:35.095
THE APPETITE TO GO AFTER THE

05:33:35.161 --> 05:33:38.531
SELLER. I'M HAVING A HARD TIME

05:33:38.598 --> 05:33:39.599
UNDERSTANDING THE OPPOSITION

05:33:39.666 --> 05:33:41.835

YET. I'M OF THE BILL. SO

05:33:56.716 --> 05:33:59.252
FOLLOWING A LITTLE BIT UP MY

05:33:59.319 --> 05:34:00.653
COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND AS A-

05:34:00.720 --> 05:34:02.055
PARAMEDIC IN THE NINETEEN

05:34:02.122 --> 05:34:03.890
EIGHTIES AND HEROIN OVERDOSES

05:34:03.957 --> 05:34:06.826
WERE VERY POPULAR- AT LEAST THEY

05:34:06.893 --> 05:34:10.730
HAD A CHANCE- IF THEY TOOK A

05:34:10.797 --> 05:34:14.200
LITTLE AND THEY'D BE OK- IF WE

05:34:14.267 --> 05:34:16.569
GOT THERE WITHIN FOUR MINUTES

05:34:16.636 --> 05:34:18.571
BABY OKAY. APARTMENT WAS BECAUSE

05:34:18.638 --> 05:34:20.774
WE WERE ABLE TO ADMINISTER

05:34:20.840 --> 05:34:23.777
RESPONSIBLY ADMINISTERED ARCANE

05:34:23.843 --> 05:34:25.512
. I'LL TALK ABOUT NOR CAN LIKE

05:34:25.578 --> 05:34:27.046
IT'S- MANAGER. IN A DAY WHEN

05:34:27.113 --> 05:34:28.081
YOU'RE ON SCENE AND BRING

05:34:28.148 --> 05:34:29.716
SOMEBODY BACK FROM NOT BREEDING

05:34:29.783 --> 05:34:32.819
AN ALMOST DEAD IT IS ALMOST LIKE

05:34:32.886 --> 05:34:34.287
MAGIC. BUT IF YOU'RE AN

05:34:34.354 --> 05:34:35.321
UNTRAINED PERSON YOU ADMINISTER

05:34:35.388 --> 05:34:38.091
THAT AND- SOME OF THE SIDE

05:34:38.158 --> 05:34:39.826
EFFECTS OF BRINGING SOMEBODY

05:34:39.893 --> 05:34:43.563
BACK FROM AN OVERDOSE LIKE THAT

05:34:43.630 --> 05:34:48.034
- WELL INTO ABOUT HERE. AND AND

05:34:48.101 --> 05:34:50.503
ALSO- SO CONSCIOUS TO- BEING

05:34:50.570 --> 05:34:54.908
POISONED Y BY THIS. THE FOR

05:34:54.974 --> 05:34:57.544
REACTION IS TO BUY. AND

05:34:57.610 --> 05:35:00.513
ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA IS WHAT

05:35:00.580 --> 05:35:02.582
FOLLOWS AND THAT PERSON DIES-

05:35:02.649 --> 05:35:05.151
THE OTHER THING WITH THE NOR CAN

05:35:05.218 --> 05:35:06.853
APPROACH IS AND THAT'S SOMETHING

05:35:06.920 --> 05:35:08.154
THAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THE

05:35:08.221 --> 05:35:11.024
FUTURE IS IT YET MAY HAVE SOME

05:35:11.090 --> 05:35:13.460
SPACE IT WITH THEIR BABY SOME.

05:35:13.526 --> 05:35:15.395
THAT MIGHT BE PART OF THE

05:35:15.462 --> 05:35:18.731
SOLUTION- THAT YOU KNOW. NOT

05:35:18.798 --> 05:35:20.934
HERE NOR CAN LIKE I SAID IT HAS

05:35:21.000 --> 05:35:22.569
TO BE ADMINISTERED BY PEOPLE

05:35:22.635 --> 05:35:23.837
THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

05:35:23.903 --> 05:35:26.072
AND OTHERWISE YOU WILL

05:35:26.139 --> 05:35:27.841
EXACERBATE THE SITUATION IT HAS

05:35:27.907 --> 05:35:29.209
TO BE ADMINISTERED WITHIN FORTY

05:35:29.275 --> 05:35:30.643
SIX MINUTES OF THE PERSON STOPS

05:35:30.710 --> 05:35:32.345
READING. OTHERWISE THEIR BRAIN

05:35:32.412 --> 05:35:35.715
IS DEAD. AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU

05:35:35.782 --> 05:35:38.184
CAN DO. THESE POISONINGS. IF I

05:35:38.251 --> 05:35:39.819
KNOW I KALRA POISONING IF I GAVE

05:35:39.886 --> 05:35:40.920
SOMEBODY A CYANIDE PILL AND THEY

05:35:40.987 --> 05:35:43.590
TOOK IT AND WENT OFF AND DIED

05:35:43.656 --> 05:35:45.358
THAT I POISON THEM. THERE'S NO

05:35:45.425 --> 05:35:47.327
TO BE TWO WAYS ABOUT IT- SAME

05:35:47.393 --> 05:35:49.529
THING WITH ANNA FREEZE A LOT OF

05:35:49.596 --> 05:35:51.097
PEOPLE- YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WANT

05:35:51.164 --> 05:35:53.466
TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY THEY LIKE

05:35:53.533 --> 05:35:54.501
FEET AMANDA FREEZE. UNTIL THEY

05:35:54.567 --> 05:35:56.402
DIE. PLEASING THAT'S NOT

05:35:56.469 --> 05:35:58.671
OVERDOSE OF ANNA FREEZE. SO

05:35:58.738 --> 05:35:59.973
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OVERDOSE

05:36:00.039 --> 05:36:00.840
HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

05:36:00.907 --> 05:36:04.110
POISONING. OF A LETHAL SUBSTANCE

05:36:04.177 --> 05:36:06.513
THAT HAS BEEN MANUFACTURED. FOR

05:36:06.579 --> 05:36:08.815
THIS FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF

05:36:08.882 --> 05:36:11.217
GETTING PEOPLE ADDICTED. TO

05:36:11.284 --> 05:36:12.886
DRUGS SO THE PEOPLE THAT DEAL

05:36:12.952 --> 05:36:15.522
DRUGS. CAN MAKE THE MONEY THAT

05:36:15.588 --> 05:36:16.990
THEY WANT TO MAKE FOR THEIR

05:36:17.056 --> 05:36:19.726
CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE. FOR US NOT

05:36:19.792 --> 05:36:21.961
TO AT LEAST CONSIDER ESPECIALLY

05:36:22.028 --> 05:36:23.897
BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE HAVE THE

05:36:23.963 --> 05:36:25.865
BIGGER DISCUSSION OF WHAT'S THE

05:36:25.932 --> 05:36:28.368
OVERALL PLAN FOR DEALING WITH

05:36:28.434 --> 05:36:30.436
FENTANYL IN CALIFORNIA WHICH I

05:36:30.503 --> 05:36:31.838
HOPE WE WILL HAVE. AN IN THE

05:36:31.905 --> 05:36:34.574
NEAR FUTURE- WE NEED TO DO

05:36:34.641 --> 05:36:37.310
SOMETHING TO SEND THE MESSAGE

05:36:37.377 --> 05:36:39.178
AND ALLOW PEOPLE THAT SELL AND

05:36:39.245 --> 05:36:41.881
KILLER KIDS AND THAT'S NOT JUST

05:36:41.948 --> 05:36:45.251
KIDS AND ADULTS. KNOWINGLY

05:36:45.318 --> 05:36:47.654
GIVING THEM SOMETHING THAT IS

05:36:47.720 --> 05:36:50.990
GOING TO KILL THEM. WE NEED TO

05:36:51.057 --> 05:36:54.694
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE. AND

05:36:54.761 --> 05:36:56.896
INSTEAD WHAT KIND OF SENDING THE

05:36:56.963 --> 05:36:58.264
MESSAGE THAT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

05:36:58.331 --> 05:37:00.166
THAT YOU'RE SELLING THEM. A

05:37:00.233 --> 05:37:03.536
POISON PILL. THAT'S HARD FOR

05:37:03.603 --> 05:37:04.938
PEOPLE OF LAST THEIR KIDS

05:37:05.004 --> 05:37:07.440
THEY'RE GOOD KIDS. THEY MAY HAVE

05:37:07.507 --> 05:37:08.274
THOUGHT THEY WERE BUYING

05:37:08.341 --> 05:37:09.842
SOMETHING THEY'LL KEEP HIM AWAKE

05:37:09.909 --> 05:37:11.544
SO THEY CAN DO THEIR HOMEWORK.

05:37:11.611 --> 05:37:13.479
SO THEY CAN DO THEY REPORT TO

05:37:13.546 --> 05:37:15.949
THEY CAN DO THEIR COLLEGE THESIS

05:37:16.015 --> 05:37:17.417
. AND INSTEAD THEY RETREAT TO

05:37:17.483 --> 05:37:19.919
THEIR ROOM THEY FALL ASLEEP AND

05:37:19.986 --> 05:37:22.722
NEVER WAKE UP. SO IT IS HARD FOR

05:37:22.789 --> 05:37:24.824
ME AS WELL- TO JUST TURNED A

05:37:24.891 --> 05:37:27.427
BLIND EYE TO WHAT THIS IS. AND

05:37:27.493 --> 05:37:30.496
NOT ALLOW- AT LEAST AS TO START

05:37:30.563 --> 05:37:33.099
WORKING ON. ONE ASPECT OF IT

05:37:33.166 --> 05:37:35.001
WHILE WE FIGURE OUT THE REST OF

05:37:35.068 --> 05:37:37.637
THOSE ASPECTS OF WHAT WILL WHAT

05:37:37.704 --> 05:37:39.405
WILL IT TAKE TO STOP THESE

05:37:39.472 --> 05:37:40.740
DEATHS. BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA

05:37:40.807 --> 05:37:43.610
GET WORSE EXPONENTIAL. THEY'RE

05:37:43.676 --> 05:37:46.079
GONNA GET WORSE. WE CAN'T JUST

05:37:46.145 --> 05:37:48.815
STAND BY AND LET IT HAPPEN. SO

05:37:48.881 --> 05:37:51.784
ANYWAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL

05:37:51.851 --> 05:37:54.253
VERY MUCH- I SEE IT IS MAYBE ONE

05:37:54.320 --> 05:37:57.557
SLIVER OF PART OF A SOLUTION FOR

05:37:57.624 --> 05:37:59.392
THE BIGGER PROBLEM- BUT WE CAN

05:37:59.459 --> 05:38:01.027
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BUT IN

05:38:01.094 --> 05:38:03.696
THE MEANWHILE- JUST WHAT YOU'RE

05:38:03.763 --> 05:38:05.965
ASKING US TO DO IS NOT

05:38:06.032 --> 05:38:08.434
UNREASONABLE. SO THANK YOU.

05:38:08.501 --> 05:38:12.005
THANK YOU. NEAR THE GOVERNMENT.

05:38:12.071 --> 05:38:15.942
YOU MAY CLOSE. I THINK YOU

05:38:16.009 --> 05:38:18.578
MISTER CHAIR AND DIVE. I DO IN

05:38:18.645 --> 05:38:20.446
IT- IN MY CLOTHES JUST

05:38:20.513 --> 05:38:21.948
ADDRESSING SOME OF THE POINT

05:38:22.015 --> 05:38:23.883
SAID THAT THE OPPOSITION REYES

05:38:23.950 --> 05:38:26.519
AND I THINK. MAKE A COUPLE

05:38:26.586 --> 05:38:27.887
CLARIFYING POINTS- SO I DO AGREE

05:38:27.954 --> 05:38:29.555
WITH MY COLLEAGUES I BELIEVE

05:38:29.622 --> 05:38:31.557
THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE HEAR THESE

05:38:31.624 --> 05:38:33.426
STORIES THESE ARE NOT OVERDOSE

05:38:33.493 --> 05:38:36.729
DEATHS THESE ARE POISONING. I'M

05:38:36.796 --> 05:38:39.532
AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE SENTINEL

05:38:39.599 --> 05:38:43.002
IS DIFFERENT. TWO GRAINS OF SAND

05:38:43.069 --> 05:38:43.870
TWO GRAINS OF SAND IS ENOUGH TO

05:38:43.936 --> 05:38:46.172
KILL A CAT. WE'VE GOT TO TREAT

05:38:46.239 --> 05:38:47.140
IT DIFFERENTLY WE'VE GOT TO

05:38:47.206 --> 05:38:49.108
TREAT IT LIKE THE DEADLY AND

05:38:49.175 --> 05:38:53.780
DANGEROUS POISON THAT IT IS.

05:38:53.846 --> 05:38:55.348
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT. GOING

05:38:55.415 --> 05:38:57.016
AFTER USERS IT'S NOT ABOUT GOING

05:38:57.083 --> 05:38:58.918
AFTER LOW LEVEL DEALERS TRACKING

05:38:58.985 --> 05:39:00.787
NOT TRAFFICKERS. TWO GRAMS

05:39:00.853 --> 05:39:04.824
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT THAT'S

05:39:04.891 --> 05:39:06.025
ONE THOUSAND ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE

05:39:06.092 --> 05:39:07.794

05:39:07.860 --> 05:39:09.595
ABOUT. AND MEET MICHAEL REALLY

05:39:09.662 --> 05:39:12.398
IS IT AND I THINK OUR STATE

05:39:12.465 --> 05:39:14.233
SCHOOL NEEDS TO BE THAT WE NEED

05:39:14.300 --> 05:39:15.435
TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE

05:39:15.501 --> 05:39:16.969
BETWEEN. REHABILITATION AND CARE

05:39:17.036 --> 05:39:17.704
FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

05:39:17.770 --> 05:39:20.640
STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION- BUT

05:39:20.707 --> 05:39:22.942

MEMBERS. I AND I BELIEVE THAT

05:39:28.781 --> 05:39:30.383
THAT THIS BILL CAN COMPLEMENT

05:39:30.450 --> 05:39:32.552
CALIFORNIA'S INCREASE INVESTMENT

05:39:32.618 --> 05:39:34.454
IN TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION

05:39:34.520 --> 05:39:35.955
AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO STRIKE

05:39:36.022 --> 05:39:37.790
THAT BALANCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

05:39:37.857 --> 05:39:39.625

FORCE MAY COME ACK AND SAY

05:43:50.142 --> 05:43:52.645

FROM A BILL THAT PASSED IN

KNOWN FORMALLY AS THE CALIFORNIA

SANCTUARY STATE BILL- I WAS IN

MY FIRST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE

05:45:40.152 --> 05:45:42.555
AT THE TIME- AND AT THE TIME AND

05:45:42.621 --> 05:45:43.889
SINCE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF

05:45:43.956 --> 05:45:45.858
STRUCK BY THE DISCONNECT

05:45:45.925 --> 05:45:48.227
BETWEEN. SORT OF THE- THE

05:45:48.294 --> 05:45:51.130
POLITICAL SYMBOLISM OF THE BILL

05:45:51.197 --> 05:45:52.598
OR THE RHETORIC ASSOCIATED WITH

05:45:52.665 --> 05:45:54.700
THAT ON THE ONE HAND- AND THE

05:45:54.767 --> 05:45:56.902
ACTUAL POLICY- THAT IT

05:45:56.969 --> 05:45:58.804
IMPLEMENTS ON THE OTHER AS YOU

05:45:58.871 --> 05:46:00.706

05:46:00.773 --> 05:46:02.675
SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. AT THE

05:46:02.741 --> 05:46:05.811
TIME- SORT OF USED IT- SEND THE

05:46:05.878 --> 05:46:07.580
MESSAGE THAT WOULD STICK.

05:46:07.646 --> 05:46:10.816
WELCOME PLACE. I WAS DEAD SENATE

05:46:10.883 --> 05:46:12.384
PASSAGE THAT WERE- YOU KNOW WHEN

05:46:12.451 --> 05:46:15.421
IN FAVOR OF THE GRANT AND SO

05:46:15.488 --> 05:46:17.089
FORTH- BUT WHAT WHAT THE BILL

05:46:17.156 --> 05:46:19.725
ACTUALLY DID. I IT YOU KNOW

05:46:19.792 --> 05:46:21.627
DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING FOR

05:46:21.694 --> 05:46:24.563
THE VAST MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS

05:46:24.630 --> 05:46:26.031
IT DOESN'T THING CERTAINLY FOR.

05:46:26.098 --> 05:46:31.237
THE MET AND WE FUNDS WERE. OUR

05:46:31.303 --> 05:46:31.837
AFTER STATING THAT THE DO ANY

05:46:31.904 --> 05:46:34.173
EITHER- FOR- UNDER IMMIGRANTS-

05:46:34.240 --> 05:46:36.108
SO LONG AS THEY HAVE NOT

05:46:36.175 --> 05:46:37.176
VIOLATED OUR CRIMINAL LAWS IN

05:46:37.243 --> 05:46:39.845
ADDITION TO- VIOLATING

05:46:39.912 --> 05:46:42.014
IMMIGRATION LAW AND THEN ON TOP

05:46:42.081 --> 05:46:44.650
OF THAT IT ACTUALLY HAS

05:46:44.717 --> 05:46:47.953
MAINTAINED SOME CATEGORIES OF

05:46:48.020 --> 05:46:50.322
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE COUNTRY-

05:46:50.389 --> 05:46:52.324
ILLEGAL IT IS A CRIME- COMMITTEE

05:46:52.391 --> 05:46:54.827
I'M THE BILL EXEMPTS- WHO IT

05:46:54.894 --> 05:46:57.930
CARVES OUT SO IT WAS A VERY VERY

05:46:57.997 --> 05:47:00.833
SPECIFIC- POLICY CHANGE- THAT

05:47:00.900 --> 05:47:02.568
WAS USED TO MAKE THESE- BROAD

05:47:02.635 --> 05:47:03.869
CLAIMS AND I THINK THAT THE

05:47:03.936 --> 05:47:05.237
REASON FOR THAT IS CALIFORNIA IT

05:47:05.304 --> 05:47:08.941
ALREADY GONE SO FAR IN ONE

05:47:09.008 --> 05:47:11.143
DIRECTION WHEN IT CAME TO ALL.

05:47:11.210 --> 05:47:13.012
MATT IT'S KIND OF. FIVE ARE TO

05:47:13.078 --> 05:47:14.313
MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT- SOME

05:47:14.380 --> 05:47:16.215
WANTED TO MAKE AT THAT TIME AND

05:47:16.282 --> 05:47:17.750
THE REASON THAT THIS WAS LAST IS

05:47:17.816 --> 05:47:19.852
THIS IS A LONG BEEN A VERY

05:47:19.919 --> 05:47:20.586
BIPARTISAN- THREE PAST

05:47:20.653 --> 05:47:22.288
ADMINISTRATIONS AT THE FEDERAL

05:47:22.354 --> 05:47:23.189
LEVEL WHETHER IT'S PRESIDENT

05:47:23.255 --> 05:47:26.091
OBAMA- PRESIDENT BUSH AND

05:47:26.158 --> 05:47:27.626
PRESIDENT REAGAN OR PRESIDENT

05:47:27.693 --> 05:47:29.562
CLINTON THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A

05:47:29.628 --> 05:47:31.897
CONSISTENT POLICY THAT

05:47:31.964 --> 05:47:33.832
IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT FOCUSES

05:47:33.899 --> 05:47:35.768
FIRST AND FOREMOST. ON THAT TO

05:47:35.834 --> 05:47:39.738
HAVE A COME IN OFF IT WILL. THE

05:47:39.805 --> 05:47:41.574
BIPARTISAN. EITHER THIS IS BILL

05:47:41.640 --> 05:47:44.877
SB FIFTY FOUR I BENNETT AND

05:47:44.944 --> 05:47:46.712
THERE WERE. A LOT OF ALARMS

05:47:46.779 --> 05:47:49.014
RAISED AT THE TIME AS TO WHAT

05:47:49.081 --> 05:47:50.316
THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES

05:47:50.382 --> 05:47:52.184
FORGET THE POLITICAL PART OF IT

05:47:52.251 --> 05:47:53.586
BUT THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES

05:47:53.652 --> 05:47:55.821
OF THE ACTUAL POLICY CHANGE-

05:47:55.888 --> 05:47:58.357
WOULD BE. I AM STATE SHERIFFS

05:47:58.424 --> 05:47:59.992
ASSOCIATION AMONG OTHERS- WARNED

05:48:00.059 --> 05:48:01.694
THAT THIS WOULD HAMPER THE

05:48:01.760 --> 05:48:04.230
ABILITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT- IN

05:48:04.296 --> 05:48:05.764
THE IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES TO

05:48:05.831 --> 05:48:08.500
MAKE SURE THAT- THIS READ DANGER

05:48:08.567 --> 05:48:10.936
PEOPLE. WERE NOT ABLE TO CAN YOU

05:48:11.003 --> 05:48:12.705
TO COMMIT MS. IN OUR COMMUNITIES

05:48:12.771 --> 05:48:15.241
AND ON PERSONAL THE PREDICTIONS

05:48:15.307 --> 05:48:17.176
HAVE HAVE EMPLOYEE AND

05:48:17.243 --> 05:48:19.878
TRAGICALLY. BORN OUT AND I'M NOT

05:48:19.945 --> 05:48:22.014
GOING TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THAT

05:48:22.081 --> 05:48:25.618
THE EXAMPLES THE BUT THERE IS

05:48:25.684 --> 05:48:27.286
ONE. THAT IS. VERY AND- I HIS

05:48:27.353 --> 05:48:29.421
ONE OF THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES

05:48:29.488 --> 05:48:30.089
I'VE EVER HEARD OF IT HAPPENED

05:48:30.155 --> 05:48:31.857
VERY CLOSE TO HERE I JUST A FEW

05:48:31.924 --> 05:48:33.592
MILES FROM THIS CAPITAL WHERE

05:48:33.659 --> 05:48:35.728
THERE WAS A MAN. WHO WENT INTO A

05:48:35.794 --> 05:48:37.563
CHURCH AND MURDERED HIS OWN

05:48:37.630 --> 05:48:39.098
THREE DAUGHTERS THEIR CHAPERONE

05:48:39.164 --> 05:48:42.067
AND THEN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE- AND

05:48:42.134 --> 05:48:43.269
THIS WAS JUST A- COUPLE MONTHS

05:48:43.335 --> 05:48:44.903
AGO ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH

05:48:44.970 --> 05:48:46.972
AND WHAT WE LEARNED SHORTLY

05:48:47.039 --> 05:48:49.308
AFTER- THIS THIS HEINOUS CRIME.

05:48:49.375 --> 05:48:50.843
IS THAT THIS INDIVIDUAL HAD IN

05:48:50.909 --> 05:48:52.811
FACT BEEN IN POLICE CUSTODY JUST

05:48:52.878 --> 05:48:55.114
FIVE DAYS EARLIER AND THE REASON

05:48:55.180 --> 05:48:57.249
HE WAS IN POLICE CUSTODY WHILE

05:48:57.316 --> 05:48:58.651
FOR ASSAULTING. A PEACE OFFICER

05:48:58.717 --> 05:49:00.953
AND THIS DIMENSION SPECIFICALLY

05:49:01.020 --> 05:49:02.755
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH

05:49:02.821 --> 05:49:04.657
SB FIFTY FOUR PASSED THIS IS

05:49:04.723 --> 05:49:05.791
MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY BY THE

05:49:05.858 --> 05:49:08.294
STATE SHERIFF ASSOCIATION. IS

05:49:08.360 --> 05:49:12.398
ONE OF MANY MANY. TIMES AT THAT

05:49:12.464 --> 05:49:17.069
. THE RESTRICTION A NATION OF S.

05:49:17.136 --> 05:49:19.672
BUT WHAT I BUT OUR ABILITY TO

05:49:19.738 --> 05:49:20.306
DEAL WITH THIS. A POLICE OFFICER

05:49:20.372 --> 05:49:22.041
THAT'S THIS SAID. IN THEIR

05:49:22.107 --> 05:49:23.909
STATEMENT BOB TO THE A GOOD.

05:49:23.976 --> 05:49:25.444
WHAT HERE. I THIS INDIVIDUAL IN

05:49:25.511 --> 05:49:27.012
CUSTODY FOR ASSAULTING A PEACE

05:49:27.079 --> 05:49:27.780
OFFICER IS IN THE COUNTRY

05:49:27.846 --> 05:49:29.381
ILLEGALLY- THE IMMIGRATION

05:49:29.448 --> 05:49:31.583
AUTHORITIES ASKED TO BE NOTIFIED

05:49:31.650 --> 05:49:34.386
OF HIS RELEASE BUT BECAUSE OF

05:49:34.453 --> 05:49:36.755
THIS SPECIFIC POLICY CHANGE THAT

05:49:36.822 --> 05:49:38.557
SB FIFTY FOUR PUT INTO PLACE-

05:49:38.624 --> 05:49:40.859
THAT THEY WERE NOT NOTIFIED. AND

05:49:40.926 --> 05:49:42.728
THEN HE FIVE DAYS LATER WENT ON

05:49:42.795 --> 05:49:44.330
TO COMMIT VERY. HEINOUS CRIME

05:49:44.396 --> 05:49:47.533
AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT CAN

05:49:47.599 --> 05:49:49.001
REASONABLY BE INFERRED THAT IF

05:49:49.068 --> 05:49:51.203
THIS LEGISLATURE HAD NOT MADE

05:49:51.270 --> 05:49:53.238

MISCONDUCT REGARDLESS OF THE

06:27:54.684 --> 06:27:55.952
NATURE. M. THAT IS INVESTIGATED

06:27:56.019 --> 06:27:57.120
BY THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS

06:27:57.187 --> 06:27:58.855
DEPARTMENT THEY HAVE EVEN THE

06:27:58.922 --> 06:27:59.823
ABILITY TO SIT IN DURING THE

06:27:59.889 --> 06:28:02.292
INTERVIEW OF OFFICERS. IT'S NOT

06:28:02.359 --> 06:28:04.894
JUST COMPLAINTS THAT THEY

06:28:04.961 --> 06:28:06.696
RECEIVE AND THEY REVIEW THE

06:28:06.763 --> 06:28:09.032
FINDINGS THEY GIVE IT. ARE MEANT

06:28:09.099 --> 06:28:11.534
ARE STILL. IN CHARGE TAKEN INTO

06:28:11.601 --> 06:28:12.769
CONSIDERATION IN THE DISCIPLINE

06:28:12.836 --> 06:28:14.537
PROCESS AND THEN ALSO RELEASES

06:28:14.604 --> 06:28:16.106
AN ANNUAL REPORT YOU CAN FIND IT

06:28:16.172 --> 06:28:18.008
ON THE WEBSITE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

06:28:18.074 --> 06:28:20.944
IT AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S RIGHT

06:28:21.011 --> 06:28:23.146
TO THE RIGHT BALANCE WHERE IT

06:28:23.213 --> 06:28:24.848
HAD SUMMARIES. AND WE CAN REVIEW

06:28:24.914 --> 06:28:26.316
IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN PUBLIC

06:28:26.383 --> 06:28:28.418
CONFIDENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:28:28.485 --> 06:28:29.986
BUT YOU HAVE TO STRIKE THE RIGHT

06:28:30.053 --> 06:28:32.522
BALANCE. BETWEEN LOOKING AT

06:28:32.589 --> 06:28:34.057
SUSTAIN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT

06:28:34.124 --> 06:28:36.693
ALLEGATIONS AS OPPOSED TO JUST

06:28:36.760 --> 06:28:39.295
ANY ALLEGATION. ANOTHER FACTOR

06:28:39.362 --> 06:28:41.097
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER IS

06:28:41.164 --> 06:28:43.533
THAT AGENCIES HAVE A YEAR

06:28:43.600 --> 06:28:45.235
GENERALLY AND SOMETIMES LONGER

06:28:45.301 --> 06:28:46.703
TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION OF

06:28:46.770 --> 06:28:49.072
MISCONDUCT. WHAT THAT RESULTS IN

06:28:49.139 --> 06:28:51.641
REAL LIFE IS THAT THERE'S OFTEN

06:28:51.708 --> 06:28:54.711
A LAG OF NINE TEN MONTHS BETWEEN

06:28:54.778 --> 06:28:57.280
A STIGMATIZING ALLEGATION AND

06:28:57.347 --> 06:28:58.815
THE ULTIMATE FINDING THAT MAY

06:28:58.882 --> 06:29:00.483
VERY WELL CLEAR AN OFFICER UNDER

06:29:00.550 --> 06:29:02.285
THIS BILL AND THEN IT'S AN

06:29:02.352 --> 06:29:04.721
OFFICER WHO'S ACCUSED OF THE

06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:07.157
STIGMATIZING. ALLEGATION WOULD

06:29:07.223 --> 06:29:08.925
HAVE THAT AND PUBLICIZE MONTHS

06:29:08.992 --> 06:29:12.095
BEFORE THEIR NAME IS EVENTUALLY

06:29:12.162 --> 06:29:14.497
CLEARED AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THE

06:29:14.564 --> 06:29:15.098
CALL. NOT GONNA GET THE SAME

06:29:15.165 --> 06:29:17.634
POOL. AS THE INITIAL ALLEGATION

06:29:17.701 --> 06:29:19.936
AND THAT'S WHY SENATOR SKINNER'S

06:29:20.003 --> 06:29:21.671
WORK WAS SO IMPORTANT IN LOOKING

06:29:21.738 --> 06:29:25.375
AT. ALLEGATIONS OF SERIOUS

06:29:25.442 --> 06:29:27.644
MISCONDUCT THIS BILL IN MY VIEW

06:29:27.711 --> 06:29:30.246
WITH THE SERI AT CIVILIAN REVIEW

06:29:30.313 --> 06:29:32.115
BOARD FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS

06:29:32.182 --> 06:29:34.017
AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE ALREADY

06:29:36.653 --> 06:29:38.788
TWENTY ONE NSP SIXTEEN ARE THEY

06:29:38.855 --> 06:29:42.459
INVOLVED SUSTAINED ALLEGATIONS

06:29:42.525 --> 06:29:43.860
OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT WE THINK

06:29:43.927 --> 06:29:46.062
COURT DECISION. IT DOESN'T

06:29:46.129 --> 06:29:47.797
MATTER WHO GENERATED A RECORD

06:29:47.864 --> 06:29:49.299
AFTER RECORD FALLS WITHIN THOSE

06:29:49.365 --> 06:29:51.801
STATUTES IT'S DISCLOSEABLE BY

06:29:51.868 --> 06:29:53.403
ANY ENTITY THAT POSSESSES THOSE

06:29:53.470 --> 06:29:55.638
RECORDS AND THOSE BILL SET FORTH

THERE'S SOME UNINTENDED. FROM

06:30:17.727 --> 06:30:20.196

REVIEW ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION

06:30:27.704 --> 06:30:31.875
THAT THEY GET OUT OF FEAR THAT

06:30:31.941 --> 06:30:33.543

PROVING THAT. COME PUBLIC AND

06:30:34.644 --> 06:30:36.246

06:30:36.312 --> 06:30:37.814
CONCERN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

06:30:37.881 --> 06:30:39.249

COMMITTEE. SO THE TWO PROBLEMS I

06:34:16.232 --> 06:34:18.568
HAVE HIS NUMBER ONE. THIS WOULD

06:34:18.634 --> 06:34:20.236
ONLY CHANGE THINGS FOR

06:34:20.303 --> 06:34:22.538
JURISDICTIONS WHICH HAVE A

06:34:22.605 --> 06:34:26.309
POLICE REVIEW BOARD UP AND SOME

06:34:26.376 --> 06:34:29.545
OF THE LARGER CITIES TO HAVE

06:34:31.447 --> 06:34:33.449
WOULD NOT SOME YOU SHOULD.

06:34:33.516 --> 06:34:35.752
PLEASE PART OF THE OTHER THING

06:34:35.818 --> 06:34:39.088
WE HAVE WORK CARE AND CAN WE

06:34:39.155 --> 06:34:44.794
DISK THE- AB ONE CAN SCHOOL SO

06:34:44.861 --> 06:34:49.165
WHAT FOR TO- HOW BILLS BY SKI.

06:34:49.232 --> 06:34:51.067
WHICH TO ME MY MIND MAYBE YOU

06:34:51.134 --> 06:34:52.902
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHAT CAN

06:34:52.969 --> 06:34:55.171
BE DISCLOSED IN. THE PRESS INTO

06:34:55.238 --> 06:34:59.776
THIS AND IT'S GREAT- AND THERE

06:34:59.842 --> 06:35:01.944
PROBABLY ARE MORE THINGS WE CAN

06:35:02.011 --> 06:35:03.646
DISCLOSE BUT THE REASON GIVEN BY

06:35:03.713 --> 06:35:07.450
. MISSION YOU KNOW SO. TOTALLY

06:35:07.517 --> 06:35:11.487
UNPACKED CHARGE OF IT COULD RUIN

06:35:11.554 --> 06:35:14.357
A PERSON'SREPUTATION AND YET

06:35:14.424 --> 06:35:16.559
THERE COULD BE NO EVIDENCE FOR

06:35:16.626 --> 06:35:19.529
IT AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE ON

06:35:19.595 --> 06:35:21.964
THE OTHER HAND IF THAT. ON THE

06:35:22.031 --> 06:35:24.700
END OF IT- BEING A POLITICIAN.

06:35:24.767 --> 06:35:26.469
GOD KNOWS THAT PROBABLY DOES

06:35:26.536 --> 06:35:29.105
HAPPEN TO US MATTER OF FACT

06:35:29.172 --> 06:35:30.706
THERE'S MY WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE I

06:35:30.773 --> 06:35:33.276
CAN POINT OUT A FEW THINGS. BOB

06:35:33.342 --> 06:35:39.749
BUT- WE DO THAT BECAUSE- BECAUSE

06:35:39.816 --> 06:35:43.786
OF BUT POLICE OFFICERS SHOULD BE

06:35:43.853 --> 06:35:46.789
IN THAT POSITION SO WE JUST NEED

06:35:46.856 --> 06:35:48.858
TO. NATIONALEN SHOULD BE

06:35:48.925 --> 06:35:51.494
DISCLOSED AND I THINK THERE

06:35:51.561 --> 06:35:53.563
PROBABLY IS SOME BUT THIS IS

06:35:53.629 --> 06:35:56.432
JUST TOO BROAD FOR ME SO AGAIN

06:35:56.499 --> 06:35:58.167
I'M GET MY IPHONE THE ADVANCE

06:35:58.234 --> 06:36:05.441
OF THE- INPUT. YES SLAPPY YEAH

06:36:05.508 --> 06:36:08.111
LET ME SAY FIRST OF ALL YOUR I

06:36:08.177 --> 06:36:10.413
DON'T DISAGREE THAT AB FACTORS I

06:36:10.480 --> 06:36:13.049
FULLY HARDLY AGREE THAT OKAY

06:36:13.116 --> 06:36:15.284
BILLION TRANSPARENCY HAS TO BE

06:36:15.351 --> 06:36:19.622
PART OF MAX STRUS FORTUNATE OF.

06:36:19.689 --> 06:36:22.358
BUT I WILL TELL YOU AS YOUNG ONE

06:36:22.425 --> 06:36:26.295
HERE ON THIS EDDIE. ZACKS DOT

06:36:26.362 --> 06:36:29.098
TESTING TIONS AGAINST-

06:36:29.165 --> 06:36:31.000
ALLEGATIONS. AND SOMETIMES

06:36:31.067 --> 06:36:33.136
ACTIONS COMMITTED BY LAW

06:36:33.202 --> 06:36:36.672
ENFORCEMENT THAT- IN THE HEARTS

06:36:36.739 --> 06:36:39.308
OF SOME PEOPLE THERE IS A

06:36:39.375 --> 06:36:42.912
RETALIATORY AND SENATE TO PURSUE

06:36:42.979 --> 06:36:45.348
THIS PROCESS AND TO ABUSE IT

06:36:45.414 --> 06:36:52.688
AND- IT'S UNFORTUNATE WHEN THAT

06:36:52.755 --> 06:36:54.857
HAPPENS BUT IT IS A REALITY. AND

06:36:54.924 --> 06:36:57.927
YOU. STE IT'S VERY DANGEROUS

06:36:57.994 --> 06:36:59.929
VERY DANGEROUS AND IT DOESN'T

06:36:59.996 --> 06:37:03.065
HELP THE TRUST THAT WE'RE TRYING

06:37:03.132 --> 06:37:05.201
TO BUILD BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S

06:37:05.268 --> 06:37:07.203
THE INTENTION. AND THE FACT IS

06:37:07.270 --> 06:37:09.939
TO ROADS THAT THAT CLOUDS TRUTH.

06:37:10.006 --> 06:37:12.308
AND I DON'T THINK THAT SHOULD BE

06:37:12.375 --> 06:37:13.843
THE INTENTION OF ANY LEGISLATIVE

06:37:13.910 --> 06:37:16.879
EFFORT- I WOULD JUST TELL YOU

06:37:16.946 --> 06:37:20.283
THAT- THE OTHER BILLS THAT- HAVE

06:37:20.349 --> 06:37:25.922
IMPROVED- THE DISCLOSURE AND THE

06:37:25.988 --> 06:37:28.324
TRANSPARENCY ARE IMPORTANT TO

06:37:28.391 --> 06:37:32.528
BUILD BACK THIS TRUST BUT I

06:37:32.595 --> 06:37:35.198
THINK THAT THIS GOES. THE ONLY.

06:37:35.264 --> 06:37:38.134
OKAY SHINS IT CAN N. AND IT WILL

06:37:38.201 --> 06:37:40.970
RUINSOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE

06:37:41.037 --> 06:37:45.107
ARE SOME VERY VERY. OUTRAGEOUS

06:37:45.174 --> 06:37:47.310
DEMANDED I'VE INVESTIGATED AND

06:37:47.376 --> 06:37:49.545
SOMETIMES THOSE OUTRAGEOUS

06:37:49.612 --> 06:37:51.514
DEMANDS PROVED TO BE TRUE.

06:37:51.581 --> 06:37:54.550
HOWEVER IF THEY'RE NOT TRUE AND

06:37:54.617 --> 06:37:56.485
THEY'RE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC

06:37:56.552 --> 06:37:58.854
IT DOES A HUGE DISSERVICE TO ALL

06:37:58.921 --> 06:38:00.923
PARTIES INVOLVED AND SO

06:38:00.990 --> 06:38:03.359
THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT

06:38:03.426 --> 06:38:05.461
THIS BECAUSE I'M REALLY REALLY

06:38:05.528 --> 06:38:09.932
UNDERSTAND. THIS BEING. SANTIAGO

06:38:09.999 --> 06:38:13.002
YEAH I HAD THAT LOOK AT A- I

06:38:13.069 --> 06:38:14.437
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

06:38:14.503 --> 06:38:16.038
AT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

06:38:16.105 --> 06:38:17.773
WE CONTINUE THAT WORKS ON THANK

06:38:17.840 --> 06:38:23.613
YOU FOR MOVING THE CONVERSATION. FOR- I JUST I DON'T WANNA

06:38:23.679 --> 06:38:25.448
SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON ECHO WHAT

06:38:25.514 --> 06:38:27.483
HAS ALREADY BEEN ECHOED AND BUT

06:38:27.550 --> 06:38:28.517
THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE

06:38:28.584 --> 06:38:29.919
BETWEEN. ACCUSATIONS ARE

06:38:29.986 --> 06:38:32.154
UNFOUNDED. AND THOSE THINGS A

06:38:32.221 --> 06:38:33.956
PERSON TO DO I MEAN WE HAVE

06:38:34.023 --> 06:38:35.291
APPLE TRANSPARENCY TO GET

06:38:35.358 --> 06:38:36.192
SOMETHING OUT PERSONS AND-

06:38:36.259 --> 06:38:38.060
PRIVATE HEALTH DECISIONS RIGHT

06:38:38.127 --> 06:38:42.231
AT. BUT IT IF THIS MAKE UP

06:38:42.298 --> 06:38:44.600
NUMBER SEVEN OF US HERE WERE TO

06:38:44.667 --> 06:38:46.569
. ACCUSE MISTER TURNER'S TIME AS

06:38:46.636 --> 06:38:49.338
AN OFFICER THAT. YOU MAY HAVE

06:38:49.405 --> 06:38:51.140
DONE SOMETHING WHEN YOU HAD A

06:38:51.207 --> 06:38:52.942
BILLS SEVEN ITEMS GOING RECORD

06:38:53.009 --> 06:38:55.511
UNLESS THEY'RE PROVEN I DO BUT

06:38:55.578 --> 06:38:56.612
IT COULD. TAKE A DAMAGE

06:38:56.679 --> 06:38:59.315
SOMEBODY'S LIFE AND REPUTATION-

06:38:59.382 --> 06:39:01.584
OF THE NOBILITY TO DEFEND

06:39:01.651 --> 06:39:05.254
THEMSELVES ARE THE FLIP SIDE.

06:39:05.321 --> 06:39:05.855
AND I RECOGNIZE THE THIS WILL

06:39:05.921 --> 06:39:09.191
MOVE AND IT SHOULD BUT I JUST

06:39:09.258 --> 06:39:11.260
WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT PIECE.

06:39:11.327 --> 06:39:13.296
DOWN THE LINE THE DIFFERENCE

06:39:13.362 --> 06:39:14.730
BETWEEN FULL TRANSPARENCY IN

06:39:14.797 --> 06:39:16.832
TRADE AND TRYING TO IMPROVE ON

06:39:16.899 --> 06:39:20.603
PUBLIC SAFETY. N. IN SOME PLACE

06:39:20.670 --> 06:39:22.438
WERE MAY NOT BE MERITED WHETHER

06:39:22.505 --> 06:39:25.041

SOME CLEVER YOU'RE GOING TO

06:41:49.385 --> 06:41:52.421
CLOSELY LOOK AT THIS YOU KNOW I

06:41:52.488 --> 06:41:54.757
MR SANTIAGO AND MISTER BRIAN AND

06:41:54.824 --> 06:41:56.692
I COME FROM AN AREA WHERE YOU

06:41:56.759 --> 06:42:01.831
HAVE- A LOS ANGELES POLICE

06:42:01.897 --> 06:42:03.999
COMMISSION WHICH WILL WHICH

06:42:04.066 --> 06:42:12.308
TRIED TO BE AFFECT.

06:42:12.374 --> 06:42:13.342
THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD

06:42:13.409 --> 06:42:14.777
RELATIONSHIP. AS OPPOSED TO THE

06:42:14.844 --> 06:42:16.545
COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WE'RE

06:42:16.612 --> 06:42:19.048
TOTALLY DYSFUNCTIONAL- WHERE THE

06:42:19.114 --> 06:42:22.351
SHERIFF DOESN'T DOESN'T EVEN

06:42:22.418 --> 06:42:26.555
TALK TO THE OVERSIGHT GROUP AND

06:42:26.622 --> 06:42:28.624
IS OPEN BE REBELLIOUS TOWARDS IT

06:42:28.691 --> 06:42:31.527
AND SO I'D I KNOW. WHEN IT COMES

06:42:31.594 --> 06:42:34.396
TO TRANSPARENCY IS REALLY

06:42:34.463 --> 06:42:36.432
IMPORTANT I THINK IT WOULD HELP

06:42:36.499 --> 06:42:38.734
FOR EXAMPLE. IS IT IT IS HELPED

06:42:38.801 --> 06:42:40.436

FORWARD WITH REFORMS AND THINGS

06:42:42.371 --> 06:42:43.839
THAT NATURE I THINK IT WOULD

06:42:43.906 --> 06:42:45.207
REALLY HELP THE SHERIFF'S

06:42:45.274 --> 06:42:47.476
DEPARTMENT IF IT WOULD OPEN UP

06:42:47.543 --> 06:42:49.345
TO CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT AND LET

THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE. OF THE

07:01:47.015 --> 07:01:49.283

07:04:40.855 --> 07:04:44.192
CONJUNCTION WITH THE FBI AND

07:04:44.258 --> 07:04:46.627
WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

07:04:46.694 --> 07:04:48.429
BOTH OF THOSE GROUPS HAVE THE

07:04:48.496 --> 07:04:51.799
ABILITY TO GET WARRANTS IF THEY

07:04:51.866 --> 07:04:55.303

LIMITED TIME- WITH COVERT

07:05:12.987 --> 07:05:15.823
EXPENDED THE- PHONE CALLS YOUR

CONVERSATIONS WERE MONITORED

07:05:17.792 --> 07:05:20.561
EVEN UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES

07:05:20.628 --> 07:05:24.665
LAWYER- CLIENT CONVERSATIONS GOT

07:05:24.732 --> 07:05:26.834

OF COURSE- MAKE THE LIKELIHOOD

07:05:28.970 --> 07:05:31.172
OF THAT EVEN GREATER. BUT THE

07:05:31.239 --> 07:05:33.474
REASON THIS IS BAD POLICY IS

07:05:33.541 --> 07:05:36.577
BECAUSE THERE IS NO REASON FOR.

07:05:36.644 --> 07:05:40.748
ON OSC TO BE ABLE TO OCS SKEWS

07:05:40.815 --> 07:05:44.518

07:05:44.585 --> 07:05:46.654
LONG ENFORCEMENT THAT THERE ARE

07:05:46.721 --> 07:05:49.323
ALREADY COOPERATING WITH I THINK

07:05:49.390 --> 07:05:51.158
THAT THIS IS A REASONABLE

07:05:51.225 --> 07:05:53.895
REQUEST FOR A WARRANT THEY HAVE

07:05:53.961 --> 07:05:56.898
THE ABILITY TO GO AND MAKE THAT

07:05:56.964 --> 07:05:59.267
HAPPEN. AND EVEN IF THEY WERE

07:05:59.333 --> 07:06:00.768
OCS WERE TO OBTAIN THE

07:06:00.835 --> 07:06:03.638
INFORMATION THEY STILL HAVE TO

07:06:03.704 --> 07:06:06.641
COOPERATE WITH LOCAL PROSECUTORS

07:06:06.707 --> 07:06:09.477
OR THE U. S. ATTORNEY AND A

07:06:09.543 --> 07:06:12.413
ORDER TO PROSECUTE ANYTHING. SO

07:06:12.480 --> 07:06:14.649
ON I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

07:06:14.715 --> 07:06:16.183
THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH HERE

07:06:16.250 --> 07:06:18.719

DECIDED THAT THE GANG DATABASE

07:06:21.289 --> 07:06:24.926

07:06:24.992 --> 07:06:29.597
PARTICIPATE. IN IT ANY MORE- AND

07:06:29.664 --> 07:06:31.299
IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA STATE

07:06:31.365 --> 07:06:33.801

OF THE BILL THEN IF THEY CAN GET

07:10:03.110 --> 07:10:04.645

INFORMATION THEY GET ISN'T. ABLE

07:10:07.181 --> 07:10:09.683

THE ALLEGATION CURVES CHARACTER

07:10:27.568 --> 07:10:29.036
