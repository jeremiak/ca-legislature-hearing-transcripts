SHARE.

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:53.957 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FIRST IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST.

IT'S THIRTY THREE PERCENT OR

00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:00.664 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
FORTY ONE PERCENT

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:01.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

CSU THAT'S JUST AS FRESHMEN THAT

00:55:07.704 --> 00:55:10.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THAT. THE MASTER PLAN.

00:55:10.273 --> 00:55:13.109 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSAL ACCESS

00:55:13.176 --> 00:55:15.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
TO A BACHELOR'S DEGREE.

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:18.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THROUGH ONE OF TWO ROUTES.

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT PREFERENCE IN THE MASTER

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:20.950 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
PLAN IS FOR THE MAJORITY OF

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
STUDENTS.

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:24.087 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FIRST ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.322 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THEN TRANSFER TO CAL STATE

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:27.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
UNIVERSITY YOUR YOU SEE. OR A

00:55:28.058 --> 00:55:29.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:18%
PRIVATE

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:31.961 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAH AND THAT'S THAT'S A COST IS

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:34.864 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IS A LOT BEHIND THAT YOU TO KEEP

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:36.066 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COSTS DOWN KEPT A COMMITTEE

00:55:36.132 --> 00:55:38.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COLLEGES HAVE LOWER. OPERATING

00:55:38.301 --> 00:55:40.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COSTS THEN YOU SEE INSIDIOUS YOU

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:43.506 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
YOU SEE FOCUSES ON RESEARCH CSU

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:45.408 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAS RESEARCH AS WELL AND AND A

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:46.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LOT OF UPPER DIVISION STUDENTS

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:48.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S A MORE EXPENSIVE SYSTEM. SO

00:55:48.211 --> 00:55:49.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE IDEA OF IN THE MASTER PLAN

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IS TO HAVE THE MAJORITY OF

00:55:52.415 --> 00:55:54.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDENTS GO TO. OUR COMMITTEE

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.351 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COLLEGES FIRST TO DO THEIR LOWER

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:57.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DIVISION COURSEWORK AND THEN GO

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.622 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO UC AND CSU. YEAH IDEA THERE

00:55:59.689 --> 00:56:00.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
IS IF.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IF THE STATE CAN.

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:04.861 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
REDUCE COSTS AT THE LOWER

00:56:04.928 --> 00:56:06.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DIVISION LEVEL THEY'LL BE MORE

00:56:06.696 --> 00:56:08.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MONEY FOR THE STUDENTS WHEN THEY

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:10.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ARRIVE AS TRANSFER STUDENTS.

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:13.269 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO. THE FIRST POINT IS ABOUT

00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:15.171 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TRANSFER YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS IS

00:56:15.238 --> 00:56:16.339 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONLY THIRTY

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE PERCENT OF STUDENTS ARE

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:19.309 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FORTY ONE PERSON STUDENTS HAVE A

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:20.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
CHANCE TO GO TO.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:21.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CS YOU IT JUST MEANS THEY HAVE

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:23.546 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO GO TO A CHANCE TO GO TO CSU

00:56:23.613 --> 00:56:24.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
AS FRESHMEN

AND IN FACT.

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S ABOUT HALF I THINK GIVE CSU

00:56:28.985 --> 00:56:31.888 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STUDENTS ARE. A GRADUATES OF THE

IS.

AND SO.

00:56:58.915 --> 00:57:01.317 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND AT SAME TIME CSU IS A MORE

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:03.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EXPENSIVE SYSTEM BY VIRTUE OF

LAUGHING BEHIND YOU RIGHT NOW SO

01:02:04.821 --> 01:02:06.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
GO AHEAD WEALTH OF ONE OF THE

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:07.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO POINT

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.058 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT WITHOUT IS THAT STARTING

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:09.625 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:38%
MANY YEARS AGO.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:11.427 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE TOOK OF A REAL CLOSE LOOK AT

01:02:11.494 --> 01:02:12.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALL OF OUR DEGREES TO SEE HOW

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
MANY OF THEM WERE IN EXCESS OF

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHAT THE TYPICAL HUNDRED TWENTY

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
UNITS IN ORDER TO GRADUATE.

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:18.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK THAT TIME THE NUMBER WAS

01:02:18.601 --> 01:02:20.236 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:22.839 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR KEY OF OUR. OF OUR DEGREES

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
REQUIRED ONLY HUNDRED TWENTY

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.008 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GRADUATE SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MOVED TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:29.445 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
OUR.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I DEGREES NEEDING ONE HUNDRED

01:02:30.680 --> 01:02:32.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TWENTY UNITS ONLY.

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE NEXT THE ADDITIONAL FIVE

01:02:34.117 --> 01:02:35.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PERCENT ARE USUALLY IN THE

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:36.586 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ENGINEERING FIELD OF THE

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE LIKE I

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:39.388 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
THINK WE MADE. A COLOSSAL

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:40.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CHANGES ADMINISTRATIVELY OVER

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:42.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS IN THAT

01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:43.860 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AREA. SO YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:02:43.926 --> 01:02:45.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SITUATION WHERE IN ORDER TO

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:46.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%
GRADUATE.

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:47.396 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOU NEED TO TAKE A HUNDRED

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:49.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIRTY FIVE MINIMUM I THINK ONE

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.300 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ISSUE THAT I THINK LA WAS RAISED

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.802 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:68%
IN THE PAST RECENT PAST HAS
BEEN.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.070 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WHEN YOU HAVE THE NUMBER OF

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:55.271 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMMITTEE COLLEGES STUDENTS

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:56.639 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ENTERING WITH MORE THAN SAY

01:02:56.706 --> 01:02:58.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY UNITS.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
THAT'S

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:02.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE UNITS BEING TAKEN BY THOSE

01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:03.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
STUDENTS THE NECESSARY TO ONE

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GET A A. OR TO TO THAN USE OVER

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.284 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE C. ISSUE SO YOU HAVE MORE

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:10.653 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNITS BEING CONSUMED SO TO SPEAK

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BY A STUDENT. THEN WHAT WOULD

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:13.456 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
NEED TO BE.

01:03:13.523 --> 01:03:14.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
KNOW IF IF THE LA WOULD LIKE TO

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMENT ON THAT THEY CAN BUT

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:19.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
FROM OUR VANTAGE POINT.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF.

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:23.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ART AND SCIENCE TO IT I THINK

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:24.667 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW STUDENTS ARE ENTERING

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:26.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR COLLEGE YEARS MAYBE AS A

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:28.237 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
COMMITTEE COLLEGE STUDENT OR

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:30.206 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EVEN IN THE C. ISSUE. AND SOME

01:03:30.273 --> 01:03:31.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THEM DON'T QUITE KNOW YET

01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:32.608 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO WITH THEIR

01:03:32.675 --> 01:03:33.876 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LIVES SO THEY'RE EXPLORING

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:34.911 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
DIFFERENT DEGREES RIGHT YOU

01:03:34.977 --> 01:03:36.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MIGHT ENTER AS A. AS A CHEM

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.014 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAJOR AND YOU MAY DECIDE CAM

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ISN'T MY THING YOU MAY WANT TO

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:41.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT GREE. SO

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:43.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE UNITS COULD BE ACCUMULATED

01:03:43.519 --> 01:03:44.453 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:43%
IN WAYS IN WHICH.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.288 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THIS DUDE HAD INTENDED TO GO

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TOWARDS BUT THEN OPTED TO CHANGE

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:48.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH WOULD REQUIRE YOU KNOW YOU

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:49.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE TO TAKE ADDITIONAL COURSES

01:03:49.659 --> 01:03:50.560 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
TO TAKE A DIFFERENT AGREE

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
UNDERSTANDUNDERSTAND YEAH. OKAY

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:52.895 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
SO.

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:54.263 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
MY WHOLE ISSUE DRIVING THIS

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:55.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
DISCUSSION IS.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:58.367 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:03:58.434 --> 01:03:59.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK DESY ISSUE DOES NEED TO BE

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:03.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
FUNDED AT A HIGHER LEVEL.

01:04:03.139 --> 01:04:05.074 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE I THINK THE THIRTY THREE

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:07.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERCENT THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

01:04:07.443 --> 01:04:08.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
ISN'T REALLY.

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
RELEVANT TO WHAT WE NEED IN

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.314 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THAT IN THIS SOCIETY WANT FOR

01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.481 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
THE FUTURE.

01:04:12.548 --> 01:04:14.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ADDITIONALLY THOUGH I HEAR WHAT

01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:16.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THE GOVERNOR'S DOING I THINK SO

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.853 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I SQUEEZE IN THIS YEAR'S CHOOSES

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WENT WHEN IF I WAS HIM I'D

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:21.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
USE IN OKAY. I'M GIVEN MONEY TO

01:04:21.991 --> 01:04:23.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE COMMITTEE CALLED THIS YEAR'S

01:04:23.092 --> 01:04:24.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
USE AND UNIVERSITIES AND YOU

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GUYS JUST BECAUSE WE PLAY NICE

01:04:26.095 --> 01:04:28.064 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO STREAMLINED. STREAMLINE THIS

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROCESS I SEE WHERE YOU HAVE

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YOUR THREE OBJECTIVES FAIR

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:34.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COMPENSATION I AGREE THAT'S

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:36.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
WONDERFUL.

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:36.906 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASING ACCESS THAT'S NEAT.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES BUT I

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK YOU ALSO AND LOOK AT A

01:04:40.643 --> 01:04:42.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
FOURTH ELEMENT OUT BE

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.479 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
STREAMLINING THE COURSE

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:44.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHEDULED TO TRANSFER LEVELS. SO

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.916 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT THEY'RE MORE EFFICIENT AND

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
EFFECTIVE AND CHEAPER.

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.519 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
IN IN ACTUALLY SAY THE TIME FOR

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THE STUDENTS SO.

01:04:52.321 --> 01:04:53.589 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVEN THOUGH I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:54.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND I TOLD EVERYBODY THAT I

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:56.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS ISSUES

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:58.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ON THE INCREASE IN FUNDING.

01:04:58.561 --> 01:04:59.829 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR IN THE

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:02.098 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SENSE THAT WE NEED TO SEE SOME

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:03.733 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MORE EFFORT ON THEM AS THE SOLE

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ISSUE TRANSFER. IN TRANSIT

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:07.169 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN THE WHOLE

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SYSTEM TO GET PEOPLE IN AND OUT.

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:10.439 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THEY GO AND GET A JOB AND GET

01:05:10.506 --> 01:05:12.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OUT OF THE SCHOOLS IN. LIFE WILL

BE GOOD I WON'T GO INTO A LOT OF

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:15.244 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DETAIL ABOUT THAT BUT ONE THING

OF THIS CAMPEONATOS FAMILIES

01:11:41.997 --> 01:11:43.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
EVERY ONE PERCENTAGE POINT HERE

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MAY SEEM LIKE A SMALL NUMBER

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
MOVING FROM FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:48.771 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO FIFTY NINE PERCENT. BUT THAT

01:11:48.837 --> 01:11:50.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

HAS HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS BECAUSE

01:11:57.212 --> 01:11:58.847 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE HAVE AS WE MENTIONED BEFORE

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:00.182 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.550 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND STUDENTS

INCREASES HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:08.824 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF STUDENTS THAT THAT ATTAINED

01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:10.559 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AGREE THAT MAYBE THAT MAY NOT

HAVE.

01:12:11.593 --> 01:12:13.429 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HAVE HAD WE NOT OTHERWISE. HAVE

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:14.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
THESE EFFORTS A PLACE.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:16.331 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SO THIS EFFORT IS REALLY A

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.600 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
STRATEGIC EFFORT THAT IS BASED

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ON THE PHILOSOPHY.

01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:21.837 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WE PUT A STAKE IN THE GROUND AND

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:23.038 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
MEASURE PROGRESS

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.807 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SLIDE TWO SHOWS US HOW WE WENT

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.575 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT MEASURING THAT AND HOW WE

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:28.077 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:48%
SET UP THE THE THE.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.511 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT WE HAVE.

01:12:29.578 --> 01:12:30.679 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THE SLIDE SHOWS UP HERE GROUP

01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:32.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOR CINEMA STATE WHAT WE DID TWO

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:34.316 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
YEARS AGO WE SET UP THESE

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:35.918 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
BENCHMARK AMBITIOUS GOALS. IS

01:12:35.984 --> 01:12:38.120 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT WE FOUND PEER DATA FOR EACH

01:12:38.187 --> 01:12:39.922 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE OF OUR TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.323 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
AND SET A PLOT SO THAT EACH

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:42.991 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAMPUS WOULD HAVE GRADUATION

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:44.359 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
RATES IN THE TOP QUARTILE THE

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.261 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TOP TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.230 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR NATIONAL PEERS ABOVE AND

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BEYOND THAT WE SENATE GROWTH

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:51.266 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THAT TRAJECTORY FOR THEM TO

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.035 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INCREASE BEYOND THAT. SO WASN'T

01:12:53.102 --> 01:12:55.938 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ENOUGH FOR THOSE CAMPUSES TO BE

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:56.739 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
AS GOOD AS THEIR PEERS ARE
TODAY.

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:57.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
THE BILL THE GRADUATION

01:12:57.740 --> 01:12:59.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INITIATIVE WAS TO GET INTO TO BE

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:01.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE BASS IN THEY TO INCREASE

01:13:01.176 --> 01:13:02.311 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT ALL THE WAY THROUGHOUT. SO

01:13:02.377 --> 01:13:03.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE'S A WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN

NUMBERS.

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:36.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
BEHIND THE TWENTY THESE

CALIFORNIA IN THE PAST TO TALK

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.472 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

THAT DEGREE GAP THAT SINCE

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:56.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE PAID IT TO BE EXIST IN THE

SALARY FOR COLLEGE GRADUATE

I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU I I

01:50:46.206 --> 01:50:48.041 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THINK WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS IS

01:50:48.108 --> 01:50:48.675 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WHEN A STEEP YOU CAN TALK ABOUT

IT.

01:50:49.509 --> 01:50:51.011 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS WHO

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:52.645 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
LOST THEIR CRAFT CAL GRANT

THAT.

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:56.116 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:59.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
BORROW MONEY OR MAYBEGET LACKEY

01:50:59.686 --> 01:51:01.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%

OR ON YOU KNOW FIGURED OUT BUT

01:51:03.456 --> 01:51:05.225 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THEY'RE QUITE A FEW WHO WHO RAN

01:51:05.291 --> 01:51:07.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:51:08.995 --> 01:51:09.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
RIGHT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:51:09.929 --> 01:51:11.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SCHOOL AND SO CAN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:12.899 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHAT WE THINK AS FAR AS HOW MANY

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:14.868 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PEOPLE OUT THERE AND. MAYBE JUST

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:16.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.142 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY OR FINANCE

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:24.177 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
LADLES BUILDING WE KNOW THAT IN

01:51:24.244 --> 01:51:25.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
THE SACRAMENTO REGION THERE

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:27.647 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SIXTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE.

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.215 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHO ARE WITHIN FIFTEEN CREDITS

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:31.117 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
OF GRADUATING?

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:33.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:53%
THEY NEVER GRADUATED.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHY.

01:51:35.955 --> 01:51:36.823 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WELL FOR SOMEONE LIFE GOTTEN

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:38.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

FOR SOME OF THEM THEY GOT A

01:51:39.893 --> 01:51:42.362 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BETTER JOB ON THE LONG THE WASTE

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:44.130 align:middle line:79% position:50% size:65%
FOR SOMEONE COLLEGE WASN'T
RIGHT.

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:46.166 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FOR A VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:46.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:51:46.766 --> 01:51:48.101 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PERCENTAGES AND WERE TRYING TO

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:50.503 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
FIGURE THAT OUT AS PART OF THE.

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND INITIATIVE WITH LINE CAPITAL

01:51:52.138 --> 01:51:54.340 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
REGION RIGHT NOW BUT FOR A VERY

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:55.742 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
HIGH PERCENTAGE THEY GOT TO THE

01:51:55.809 --> 01:51:58.411 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FIFTH. TO THEIR FOURTH YEAR.

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNDING

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:00.947 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE FIFTH YEAR WITH THE CAL

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:02.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
GRANT.

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:04.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND THAT CAL GRANT MADE ALL THE

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:06.052 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD FOR THEM

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:07.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO BE ABLE THAT THE COME. AND IF

01:52:07.821 --> 01:52:09.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU CAN'T PAY FOR YOUR TUITION

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:10.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE YOUR

01:52:10.690 --> 01:52:12.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
DEBTS.

01:52:12.358 --> 01:52:14.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YEAH ADDING UP YOU DROP OUT.

01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:16.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
AND SO THAT'S Y. WE WANT TO SEE

01:52:16.696 --> 01:52:19.132 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
EVERY STUDENT WE POSSIBLY CAN

01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:21.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. SO THAT

01:52:21.234 --> 01:52:23.770 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY DON'T GET TO THAT PRECIPICE

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND JUST SIMPLY GIVE UP SHARE.

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:27.207 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TWENTY

01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:29.409 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
THREE CAMPUSES AND EVERYONE'S

01:52:29.476 --> 01:52:30.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENT YOU'RE DIFFERENT OTHER

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:31.945 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
PRESIDENTS JUST LIKE

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:33.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERSONALITIES IN THE PLAN SO GET

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:35.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT BE DIFFERENT BUT. WHAT WHAT

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:36.983 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
DO YOU THINK OF A COUPLE THINGS

01:52:37.050 --> 01:52:38.718 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT WE COULD DO AS A STATE AND

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:41.287 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND IT'S NOT JUST PICKING ON CSU

01:52:41.354 --> 01:52:42.422 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THIS ISSUE THAT?

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:43.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT THE UC LEVEL ON A COMMITTEE

01:52:43.690 --> 01:52:45.592 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
COLLEGE BUT CSU IS THE WORK

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:47.327 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
COURSES FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS

01:52:47.393 --> 01:52:49.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NEARLY THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE. I

01:52:49.329 --> 01:52:50.964 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:53.199 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN THIS WITH WHAT THAT FOUR YEAR

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:53.766 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
INSTITUTIONS WITH YOU SEE.

01:52:53.833 --> 01:52:55.401 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:03%
.

01:52:55.468 --> 01:52:56.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:52:56.736 --> 01:52:59.305 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
WHAT TYPE OF OP HE

01:52:59.372 --> 01:53:00.006 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IN MANY TAKEN ME ASKING OTHER IN

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:01.374 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ANOTHER WAY IS THAT YOU TALKED

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:03.042 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
ABOUT THE COMPACT THAT STUDENTS

01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:05.044 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
SIGN.

01:53:05.111 --> 01:53:05.879 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
I'M REALLY INTRIGUED BY DON'T

01:53:05.945 --> 01:53:07.213 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK THIS MESS SIMPLISTIC TERMS

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:08.982 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOR US PEOPLE WHO GET A CREDIT

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:10.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%

YOU BUY NEW TV AT. SOUND SYSTEM

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:14.954 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT BEST BUY YOU GET A THING IN

01:53:15.021 --> 01:53:16.956 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:33%
THE MAIL FOR.

YEARS THAT YOU'LL END UP PAYING.

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:26.866 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS NOT A

01:53:26.933 --> 01:53:27.867 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR YOUR

PEOPLE'S ATTENTION SO. IS THIS

01:53:32.639 --> 01:53:33.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE

THAT IS SO THAT TO ME LOOKS LIKE

02:18:05.143 --> 02:18:07.112 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SOMEBODY'S

TELL ME A STORY ALL I THINK THAT

02:18:08.113 --> 02:18:08.680 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
I THINK THE DIFFICULTY IN UNDER

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:09.814 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
IN THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU.

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:10.882 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STARTING

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:11.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
YEARS FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOOK AT

02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:11.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
HOW WE SET

02:18:11.816 --> 02:18:13.018 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:13%
THAT.

02:18:13.084 --> 02:18:14.352 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SET REALISTIC GOALS BASED ON NOT

02:18:14.419 --> 02:18:15.920 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ONLY WHERE OUR APPEARANCE IT

02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:17.055 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SINCE ARE TODAY. WHAT WHERE THEY

02:18:17.122 --> 02:18:17.689 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL BE IN THE FUTURE THAT'S HOW

02:18:17.756 --> 02:18:18.256 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
WE GOT TO THE FORTY PERCENT

02:18:18.323 --> 02:18:19.157 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
FOR?

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:20.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IN BETWEEN THAT WHAT HAPPENS

02:18:21.026 --> 02:18:22.994 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH COHORTS ARE GROUP'S AS RYAN

02:18:23.061 --> 02:18:23.595 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
WAS MENTIONING THAT ARE STILL

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:25.597 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
AND.

02:18:25.664 --> 02:18:26.264 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT'S ARE ANY KIND OF BAKED AND

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:26.898 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO WHETHER IT'S FOUR PERCENT NOW

02:18:26.965 --> 02:18:28.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUR THREE PERCENT NOW IS NOT

02:18:28.166 --> 02:18:29.501 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
INDICATIVE NECESSARILY OF WHERE

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:30.201 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:63%
WE'RE GOING TO BE ART OUR

02:18:30.268 --> 02:18:30.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRAJECTORY TAKES US TO FORTY

02:18:30.869 --> 02:18:31.870 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT'S VERY

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:32.937 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
REASONABLE AN AMBITIOUS COMPARED

02:18:33.004 --> 02:18:35.106 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
TO OUR PEERS WE MAY BE A LITTLE

HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE. BUT

02:18:38.076 --> 02:18:38.643 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TARGETING ALL

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:39.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RIGHT NOW. NOW WHEN I LOOK AT US

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:33.457 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
OF THE LOWEST DIVERSITY.

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:35.492 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
ALSO OF CSU WHAT KINDA IMPACT

02:40:38.562 --> 02:40:40.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
SO WITH THIS NEW POLICY ALL

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:42.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
CAMPUSES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO

02:40:42.132 --> 02:40:44.167 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:23%

ESPECIALLY TUITION INCREASE IS

02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:32.641 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THE FACT THAT. THEY'RE GONNA

02:57:32.708 --> 02:57:34.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY'RE HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

02:57:34.844 --> 02:57:36.145 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:73%
LIVING EXPENSES ARE HAVING TO

02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:37.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CHOOSE BETWEEN BUYING THE KIDS

02:57:37.713 --> 02:57:40.282 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%

INCREASE. IT IT BECOMES.

02:57:44.954 --> 02:57:45.821 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT BECOMES A LOT HARDER FOR THEM

02:57:45.888 --> 02:57:45.988 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

02:57:46.055 --> 02:57:47.089 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
MAKE A CHOICE AND.

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:48.657 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:28%
OVERALL IT.

02:57:48.724 --> 02:57:49.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR US AS

02:57:49.925 --> 02:57:50.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
VETERANS IS THE LACK OF

02:57:50.860 --> 02:57:51.227 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
ATTENTION I GUESS.

02:57:51.293 --> 02:57:54.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WE DO SEE AN INCREASE IN OUR

02:57:54.230 --> 02:57:56.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:58%
DROP OUTS FOR VETERANS.

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:57.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:57:57.166 --> 02:57:57.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DON'T WANT TO SEE IS SPECIAL

02:57:57.733 --> 02:57:58.968 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
BECAUSE.

02:57:59.035 --> 02:58:00.069 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
WE FEEL LIKE WE'VE DONE SO MUCH

02:58:00.136 --> 02:58:01.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
ALREADY FOR THE COUNTRY AND

02:58:01.504 --> 02:58:03.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EVERYTHING THAT WE REALLY CHOOSE

02:58:03.672 --> 02:58:04.940 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BETTER

02:58:05.007 --> 02:58:08.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OURSELVES. AND BECAUSE ALL OUR

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:09.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:68%
TIME TO CAN'T FIND WORK OUT

02:58:11.547 --> 02:58:14.050 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NUMBER OF DISABLED VETERANS WHO.

02:58:14.116 --> 02:58:16.118 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:78%
