OKAY N. DOZEN ORDERED SHOES IN EGGMAN YOU MAY GO AHEAD PRESENT YOUR BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY TODAY A STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT WE THINK IMPACTFUL PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THE MILITARY COMMITTEE HAS EXPERIENCED INCREASE IN REPORTED INCIDENTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TWENTY EIGHTEEN ANNUAL DEPORT REPORT ON SECTIONS SEXUAL ASSAULT THE MILITARY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. DOCUMENTS SIX THOUSAND AND FIFTY THREE REPORTS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THE NUMBER ROSE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. REPORT EIGHTEEN SEXUAL ASSAULTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THAT NUMBER HAS CONTINUED TO JOG BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE ESTABLISH A SEXUAL ASSAULT ACCOUNTABILITY INVESTIGATION TASK FORCE AND THEY FOUND A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN. SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WITHIN MILITARY UNITS. THIS BILL TRIES TO PREVENT ASSAULT THROUGH EARLY INTERVENTION BY MAKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT A STANDALONE OFFENCE. IT REQUIRES THAT INSTANCES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT BE REPORTED ALONG SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE REPORT. AND MADE PUBLIC THROUGH THE RELEASE OF DATA. FINALLY IT CLARIFIES A CRIMES INCLUDING% SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM CIVIL OR CRIMINAL LIABILITY. PASSAGE OF THIS BILL WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA THE NATIONAL LEADER IN PROTECTING MILITARY PERSONNEL WITHIN STATE JURISDICTION. IN WITH ME HERE TODAY- BY WITNESS IN SUPPORT I SHOULD SAY IS JENNIFER WHO CERRO WHO SERVED IN ACTIVE DUTY IN THE AIR FORCE FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS AND IS NOW PROGRAM DIRECTOR. AT THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD AND I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT ALSO ON THE LINE TO PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU CENTER WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- THOSE WAITING AND WANTED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF THE BILL. DUE TO CONSTRAINTS REGARDING THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING TECHNOLOGY CONSIDERATIONS AND CLEANING PROTOCOLS COMMITTEE CHAIR. MAY INSTITUTE A TIME LIMIT ON THE TESTIMONY.

YOU KNOW WHAT I UNDERSTAND YES THIS IS JANET I'M SORRY THIS IS JENNIFER THE CEREBRAL MORNING THE MORNING I WAS THE STATE SIX ASSAULT RESPONSE COORDINATOR FOR THE MILITARY- DEPARTMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE FIFTY TWO. AND BY RELEASING THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT SEXUAL ASSAULT REPORT TO THE PUBLIC AS OTHER MILITARY DEPARTMENT STILL IT ALLOWS FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY ON THE NUMBER OF CASES REPORTED BY GUARD MEMBERS AND THE REPORT ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE REPORTING PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES. AND DESCRIBES THE WHAT THE SUPPER PROGRAM IS DOING IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION AND PREVENTION WHICH THE PUBLIC MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE US TO AS A TWENTY TWO YEAR ACTIVE DUTY VETERAN I'M ALSO VERY FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF AMENDING THE STATE UCMJ TO MAKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT A CRIME. AS THIS CONDUCT NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE GOOD ORDER AND DISCIPLINE OF THE MILITARY AND WE KNOW THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT FALLS WITHIN A CONTINUUM OF HARM AND THAT'S IT'S UNCHECKED IT INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE SEXUAL FALL OCCURRING SO MAKING SEXUAL HARASSMENT A CRIME PUNISHABLE UNDER THE STATE UCMJ. HOLDS MORE WEIGHT THAN JUST SAYING YOU KNOW THERE'S A ZERO TOLERANCE AND I BELIEVE SERVICE MEMBERS WILL TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY AND IT CAN ACTUALLY PREVENT FUTURE SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCIDENTS AS WELL AS SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND IF IT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT INCIDENT IS SUBSTANTIATED THE COMMANDER HAS ANOTHER OPTION TO TAKE ACTION. AGAINST THE OFFENDER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THE YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BEFORE I START LET ME- THAT NOTE THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS THIS IS ACTION THE FIRST TIME IN MEMORY THAT ALL SEVEN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE OR THEMSELVES VETERANS- ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST THIS INCLUDES THREE FEMALE VETERANS- FROM THE ARMY NAVY AND FROM THE AIR FORCE THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF FEMALE VETERANS. EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE- AND SO WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS COMMITTEE LET ME BEGIN MR CHAIR AND SENATORS I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF SB SIX SIX ONE WHICH MAKES UPDATES AND TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THOSE SECTIONS OF CALIFORNIA MILITARY AND VETERANS CODE PERTAINING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS HOME LOAN PROGRAM BEFORE I START LET ME KNOW THAT I HAVE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS. LET ME ALSO NOTE THAT THIS BILL HAS SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES PASSAGE OF SB SIX SIX ONE WILL GRANT CALVET THE AUTHORITY FOR THE FIRST TIME TO REFINANCE HOME LOANS UNDERWRITTEN BY THE CALVET HOME LOAN PROGRAM DESPITE THE IMPORTANT BENEFITS ASSOCIATE WITH THE ABILITY TO REFINANCE EXISTING LOANS CALVET IS CURRENTLY PROHIBITED UNDER STATUTE FROM DOING SO. CALVET HOME LOANS ARE ADVANTAGEOUS IN UNIQUELY SUITED TO VETERANS BECAUSE THE LOANS OFFER COMPETITIVE MARKET RATES WHILE RECURRING PORT WHILE REQUIRING REDUCED DOWN PAYMENTS AS A RESULT OF ITS ACCUMULATED EXPERTISE WITH THIS VERY SPECIFIC CLIENTELE CAL THAT TENDS TO ACQUIRE LIST REQUIRE LESS DOCUMENTATION IN A PRIVATE LENDER IN THIS NOT REQUIRE THAT BORROWERS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE BANK TO UNDERWRITE UNDERWRITING HOME LOAN TO VETERANS CALVET FRANKLY UNDERWRITES HOME BUT HOME LOANS TO VETERANS FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR MIGHT EXCLUDE OR OVERLOOKED BY DELIBERATELY. WORKING WITH VETERANS OKAY ATIONS MIGHT OTHERWISE BE REJECT AS THREE OF CAN. HOME LOANS PRO. RICHARD MATRIX BAY AND- UNDERWRITING PROCESSES. IN ADDITION TO EXPAND CALVET SET THE ORDER TO REFINANCE EXISTING CALVET HOME LOANS AT COMPETITIVE MARKET RATES. SB SIX SIX ONE WOULD ALSO MAKE OTHER MINOR FAIRLY TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE RELEVANT STATUTES. SUCH AS ALLOWING CALVET TO OFFER LOANS WITH LESS THAN A THIRTY YEAR PAY BACK. WHILE ADHERING TO US DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS LOAN LIMIT AND APPRAISAL GUIDELINES. UNDER CURRENT STATUTE CALVET MAY ONLY MAKE HOME LOANS TO MILITARY RESERVISTS ARE MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD. IF THEY ARE STILL SERVING AND HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE YEAR OF A SIX YEAR COMMITMENT. COURTS PRISONS AND RESERVISTS HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY THEY SHOULD NOT BE PENALIZED BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT ORDERED TO ACTIVE DUTY. ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL WILL ENABLE CALVET TO MAKE HOMELESS TO MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS NATIONAL GUARD WITH COMPLETED A SIX YEAR SERVICE OBLIGATION. AND THEN SEPARATED EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT CALLED UP TO ACTIVE DUTY DURING THE TIME IN UNIFORM. IT'S AN IMMENSE WERE SURPRISED TO CALVET THAT THE CALVET HOME LOAN PROGRAM HAS ALWAYS BEEN SELF FINANCING AND IS NEVER DRAWN ON THE GENERAL FUND TO PAY. A MINUTE COSTS. OR FOR DEBT. SB SIX SIX ONE WILL ALLOW CALVET TO MAINTAIN THIS TRADITION WHILE ENSURING THAT THE CALVET HOME LOAN PROGRAM. pCOMPETITIVE HOME LOANS MARKET TO HELP CALIFORNIA VETERANS BETTER WEATHER CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES FOR YEARS TO COME.
