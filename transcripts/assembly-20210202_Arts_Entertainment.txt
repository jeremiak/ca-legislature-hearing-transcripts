AND THIS IS THE STORY ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA- TOURISM ENTERTAINMENT IS REALLY. FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR IDENTITY AS CALIFORNIANS. SO GIVING GUIDANCE TO THIS INDUSTRY GIVING THEM CLEAR BENCHMARKS CLEAR ROAD MAP TO FOLLOW. IS CRUCIAL. FOR THE ACCOUNT OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY AND OUR IDENTITY AS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE LOSING THOSE INDUSTRIES WILL BE A HUGE BLOW.

THANK YOU- GOOD MORNING FIRST OF ALL MANAGER REALLY APPRECIATE YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR CONVENE SUCH A GREAT PANEL ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION- AN EARLIER PART OF MY LIFE I WAS AN AMATEUR MUSICIAN AND- AND THAT IT WAS THROUGH THAT BUT I MADE SOME SPENDING THINKING THAT THROUGH SCHOOL AND- TODAY REPRESENT A CITY- CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THAT IS AN ARTISTIC CAPITAL NOT ONLY FOR THE BAY AREA BUT FOR OUR STATE- OUR CITY. HAS NOT ONLY VERY LARGE INTERNATIONALLY KNOWN INSTITUTIONS BUT SMALLER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN A VERY VIBRANT BUT STRUGGLING ARTS COMMUNITY. AND I CAN CERTAINLY SPEAK AS OTHERS HAVE FOR OUR CITY IN A REGION THAT THE ARTS ARE NOT ONLY A REFLECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR VISION FOR THE WORLD BUT AN ENORMOUS ECONOMIC DRIVER JOBS DRIVER TOURISM DRIVER. AND SO THIS IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY AND I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE FOR CODED ARTS FUNDING AND SUPPORT WAS SOMETHING I DON'T THINK OUR STATE HAD PRIOR TIES IN THE WAY THAT IT SHOULD I THINK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN DO MORE AND SHOULD DO MORE. BUT CERTAINLY DURING COVERT WITH SO MANY DARK CRISES IT HAS AGAIN BEEN HARD TO PRIORITIZE THE ARTS AND WE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING MANY IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS AND ARTISTS SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY JUST HOW HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE ENGAGEMENT TODAY- AND- AND LOOK FOR THE CONVERSATION WILL BE TAKING LOTS OF NOTES UNFORTUNATELY TOGGLING BETWEEN A COUPLE OF MEETINGS BUT- REST ASSURED MY STAFF AND I ARE TRACKING THIS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- WITH.

N. ECHOING THE SENTIMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO YOU KNOW THE ARTS HAVE BEEN WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE REALLY ASK. OUR ARTS COMMUNITY- TO FIND WAYS TO SAVE US ALL INFORM THEMSELVES AND I THINK DURING THIS TIME OF COPAYS WHEN WE HAVE ACTUALLY RELYING ON HARD. TO HELP US TRANSLATE INFORMATION HE'LL FOCUS- MAKE FOLKS FEEL SAFE- DISTRACT FOLKS FROM OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE HEARING ON THE NEWS OR THEIR OWN ANXIETIES IT SHOULD BE A REMINDER TO THE STATE. THAT WE MUST DEEPLY FUND AND SUPPORT OUR ARTISTS SO I'M- VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING- FROM OUR SPEAKERS TODAY IT IS A JAM PACKED HARING I'M ESPECIALLY CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW ARE SMALLER VENUES HAVE BEEN SURVIVING AND WHAT THEY NEED FROM US NINETY NINE SEAT THEATERS- OUTDOOR PARKING USED. YOU KNOW HOW MUSEUMS BUT ALSO GALLERIES WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY NEED- TO SAFELY REOPEN IT TO STAY OPEN AND THEN AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW I WOULD ACTUALLY BE I'M VERY INTERESTED IN. ARTISTS WHO WRITE BECAUSE SINCE WE HAVE HAD TO TRANSITION FROM A LIVE AND IN PERSON ACTIVITIES- WHERE THERE SEEMS TO BE A VERY CLEAR DELINEATION BETWEEN ART AND- SORT OF. OPERATOR NOW THAT WE'RE STREAMING AND SHARING INFORMATION USING TECHNOLOGY I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO AT SOME POINT HAVE A DEEPER DISCUSSION ABOUT- ARTIST WRITES IN SORT OF WHO OWNS WHAT IS BEING SHARED SINCE WE'RE USING NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IT MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE AMBIGUOUS BUT I KNOW FOR OUR FOR ACTORS AND MUSICIANS WHO ARE USED TO CREATING THEIR OWN WORK AND THEN SHARING IT ON THE STAGE- THIS THIS THESE NEW DEVICES COULD COMPLICATE SOME OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONVENING THIS AND I. AM VERY. EXCITED TO HEAR WHAT FOLKS HAVE TO SAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY COM YOUR GOOD. AND IF- OF THE PANELISTS HAVE HEARD THAT INITIAL COMMENTS ON IT AND- THE CONCERNS BY THE MEMBERS IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THOSE IN YOUR COMMENTS. THAT BEING SAID WE'RE GOING TO START OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH IS CALIFORNIA AND- THE ARTS CHALLENGES AND PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THE ARTS. WE HAVE. FIVE PANELISTS ON THIS WHAT WE'LL DO IS GO STRAIGHT UP FROM ONE PANELIST AND THEN THE OTHER WITHOUT ANY QUESTIONS IN BETWEEN. AGAIN WE ASK OUR PANELISTS TO STAY ON TIME OUR FIRST PRESENTER IS ADAM. FOX FALL OVER FROM THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH BECAUSE- HE CAN ECONOMIES IN CALIFORNIA CREATIVE KANEMI WELCOME ADAM. GOOD MORNING. YES WE HEAR YOU THANK YOU HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE MY SLIDES AS WELL. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE LIVE BUT WE DON'T SEE YOU UNLESS YOU'RE OKAY. THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE YES OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR- I'M HERE TODAY IN MY FIVE MINUTES TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE WORK OUR FIRM BEACON ECONOMICS HAS BEEN DOING FOR THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY ONE OTIS CREATIVE ECONOMY REPORT THAT WILL BE RELEASED LATER THIS MONTH- I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF OUR RESEARCH FROM OVER THE PAST SIX MONTHS. SOME OF THE QUANTITATIVE AS WELL AS QUALITATIVE FINDINGS- WE'VE BEEN SAYING AS WE LOOKED AT THE ECONOMIC DATA THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND TALK TO STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM- ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THE CREATIVE ECONOMY I ALWAYS LIKE TO REMIND FOLKS IN FOR SEAN IS PART OF THE ECONOMY SO OFTEN TIMES. SINCE ABOUT THE ARTS ARE OFTEN. AS OTHER AS A NICE- AS A NICE OPTION TO HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE IS TAKEN CARE OF. I'D LIKE TO PUSH BACK TODAY A LITTLE BIT AGAINST THAT NOTION. WE SEE THE ARTS AS A VIBRANT PART VERY IMPORTANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY- TALKING ABOUT THE LARGER LABOR MARKET SINCE THE DEPTHS OF THE DOWNTURN IN APRIL. WE'VE ONLY RECOVERED 44% OF OUR JOBS CALIFORNIA IN DECEMBER THERE WERE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FEWER PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE STATE THEN IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY. OR NON FARM EMPLOYMENT HAS CONTRACTED ROUGHLY 8% SINCE FEBRUARY THIS BASIC GROWTH THIS RECOVERY TRAILS IN THE NATION OVERALL WHERE THE NUMBER OF JOBS IS. ONLY SHRUNK BY SIX POINT 5% IT IT. NINETEEN POSES SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO THE CREATIVE ECONOMY AND FOR RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. ARTS CULTURE CREATIVITY THESE ARE SOME OF THE KEY SECTORS THAT DRIVE OUR REGIONAL ECONOMIES THERE SO VERY IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT ECONOMIC DRIVERS IN OUR RURAL AREAS. BY THEIR VERY NATURE MANY OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTS OF THE CREATIVE ECONOMY NECESSITATE THE CONGREGATION OF A LARGE GROUPS OF UNRELATED PEOPLE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE SAME ALSO OFTEN IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY GIVEN THE NATURE. OF OUR REAL ESTATE MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA. YOU HAVE TO USE SPACE CREATIVELY. WHEN THE VENUE IS A SMALL LOCAL ARE A LARGE OUTDOOR CONCERT VENUE AND ARTS MUSEUM THESE WERE THE FIRST INDUSTRIES WE SAW TAKE A HIT. AND WE EXPECT THEM TO BE THE LAST ONE TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THE FIRST OUT IN THE LAST BACK- IN OUR REPORT WE BREAK THESE DOWN ITO FIVE KIND OF GLOBAL INDUSTRY SECTORS. AS SEATING ON THE SCREEN- AT THE END OF THE MONTH WILL BE RELEASING- THE ELDEST REPORT WHICH WILL CAPTURE ALL OF TWENTY TWENTY WITH THE SPECIAL CHAPTER. ON THE CALL WITH NINETEEN M. PACT- IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT REPORT THIS YEAR BY IN THE FALL WHEN WE WERE BEGAN OUR ANALYSIS- I. DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS NUMBERS THESE WILL BE UPDATED AS I MENTIONED IN THE END OF THE MONTH- BUT FOR NOW I THINK THEY GIVE A GOOD INDICATION. AS THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE RECOVERY- GOING INTO NOVEMBER DECEMBER- WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES- WE CLING FILM ADVERTISING DIGITAL DIGITAL VISUAL ARTS. AS WELL AS THOSE OCCUPATIONS THAT MAY BE HOUSED IN NON CREATIVE INDUSTRIES- PERFORMERS ARCHITECTS GRAPHIC DESIGNERS THAT MAY WORK AT FIRMS THAT ARE INTEGRATED INDUSTRY. THEY COME FROM THE SAME WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE THE SAME ECOSYSTEM OF NONPROFIT PARTICIPANTS EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES. IN ADDITION- TO THE DIRECT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE ARTS AND CULTURAL SECTOR SUPPORTS A LARGE NUMBER OF OTHER PROFESSIONS BOTH UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM. AS YOU SEE HERE- IN THE FALL IN AUGUST WE ESTIMATED ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND- JOBS- LOST MISSING TEMPORARILY FURLOUGHED- IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS A- HAS A HUGE IMPACT FOR THOSE SUPPLIERS UP CHANGE UP. THE FOOD CHAIN OF THE- SUPPLY CHAIN AND FOR THOSE PHONES THAT USE THAT WAGE INCOME TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. THERE'S SOME INHERENT STRUCTURAL OCCUPATIONS THAT MAKE- ARTS WORKERS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THESE UNDERLYING CHANGES. ONE OF THE MAIN NOTES IS THAT. FOLKS ARE THREE AND A HALF TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE SELF EMPLOYED IN THE ARTS WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES AND THINKING WE BECAUSE OF THE CARE ACT THE PANDEMIC OUT OF ONE OF THE SYSTEMS PROGRAM. AND ALLOW THOSE FOLKS TO CONTINUE TO- EXHIBIT NORMAL HOUSEHOLD SPENDING BEHAVIOR. AS I COME UP ON MY TIME AND SAY NO WHERE HAS THE IMPACT BEEN TO WRITE AND MORE IMMEDIATE. IN PERFORM ARTS AND WE'VE SEEN A NAY WHY- THERE IN TAX EXEMPT REVENUE- IN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF ROUGHLY FIFTY FOUR PERCENT. THIS IS DEVASTATING. AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT RECOVERY LOOKS LIKE IN THE STATE. IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION THAT ANY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT RECOVERY ANY RESILIENCE NARRATIVE INCLUDE THE ARTS THERE ARE SUCH A VALUABLE- IMPORTANT PLAYER AND THERE'S A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE. A LOT OF OUR LOCAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE REBOUND OF THE ARTS IN THE WAYS THAT THE INDUSTRIES ARE CHANGING. WE HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER HOW WE CURATE OUR ECONOMIC REGULATORY SYSTEM LOCALLY AND WITH A LENS ON EQUITY WITH THE LENS ON THE WORLD AND- LANDS ON RESILIENCE IT'S AN IMPORTANT TIME- WE DON'T SEE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY- THAT WE WANT TO BE A PART OF WITHOUT THE ARTS. FRONT AND. CENTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. THANK YOU ADAM FELLOW AND WE ARE HEARING THAT LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THE ARTS NEED TO BE PART OF ANY RECOVERY PLAN. THAT WILL THEN NOW MOVES TO AND BROWN CRAWFORD WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL WELCOME MAN. GOOD MORNING.

BROADBAND IS OFTEN AN ISSUE. SO WE SEE A PRESENTATION LET ME KNOW. OKAY GOOD GOOD AND THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL IS OUR STATE ONLY LIKE ARTS GRANT PROVIDER WITH FUNDING THAT'S ACCEPTABLE TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EVERY STATE HAS ITS STATE ARTS AGENCY AS CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS AGENCY REPRIORITIZE RACIAL EQUITY. AND HAVE A BROAD GEOGRAPHIC REACH INTO COMMUNITIES OF ALL SIZES. AS YOU JUST HEARD THE ARTS SECTOR IS A LARGE AND DIVERSE IN HIS BUSINESSES AND WORKFORCE ARE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR STATE ECONOMY AND OUR IDENTITY. AS I JOIN YOU HERE TODAY. WE AND I ARE WE WERE ALL STRUCK BY THE FIFTH ALWAYS OUR WORLD IS IN THIS MOMENT FILLED WITH DEEPLY IMPACTFUL WORDS POETRY SONG AND SPEECHES OF HOPE JUSTICE AND RECONCILIATION. THESE WORDS INCLUDING THOSE FROM ARE YOU SPEAK TO MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE SWIRLING ALL AROUND US WITH CLEAR EYES IN DETERMINATION. AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL KNOW FULL WELL THAT WE FACE HARD WORK TO LIVE UP TO THE ASPIRATIONS AND HOPE THAT ALLOWED US A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE TO BREATHE A BIT MORE FREELY. YOUR KNOWLEDGE THAT WE'RE ALL STILL IN THE MIDST OF SO MANY CRISES. DEADLY VIRUS. BEST INEQUITIES. SYSTEMIC RACISM. ECONOMIC DISPARITIES VIOLENCE AND HATE. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE PERSISTENCE AND FERVOR WITH WHICH THE ARTS SECTOR TACKLE THE PANDEMIC NEARLY A YEAR AGO STILL REMAINS BUT WARINESS IS ALSO SEVEN AND RIGHTLY SO. MY CLIENTS ARE NOT IF THE FINANCING. STATE THERE WE GO. EVERYTHING IS LIKE A LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO. THE WORLD DID NOT KNOW THE NAME AMANDA GORMAN WITH ONE POLLING THIS YOUNG ARTIST CALIFORNIA LIFTED UP THE NATION AND IN MANY WAYS. HELLO WORLD MACINNES PROBLEM HE'LL BE FINE EXPRESSED WHAT SO MANY WORK FEELING SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SET. WELL IT ALSO SPOKE HER TRUTH WITH HONESTY AND CONVICTION IN NEXT WEEK THE MAP AND IT WILL BE THE FIRST. TO PERFORM AT THE SUPER BOWL- HERE WE GO. THOSE OF US IN THE ARTS ARE NOT SURPRISED BY THIS WE'RE NOT SURPRISED A YOUNG ARTISTS CAN BE STYLISH AND NATION. AS AN ARTS EDUCATOR THAT WORKED IN RURAL CALIFORNIA CLICK SCHOOLS FOR MANY YEARS AND DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED CREATIVE EDUCATION MODELS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. I'M NOT SURPRISED THE YOUNG POET IN CALIFORNIA HAS THE POWER TO GIVE AN ENTIRE COUNTRY IF THE HOPE. HEALING AND JOY THROUGH THEIR WORDS. THAT ARTIST SPOKE TRUTH. AND THROUGH AMANDA'S WHERE'S THE POWER OF THE ARTS REACH THE HEARTS OF PEOPLE NATIONWIDE INTERFACE SO MANY OTHERS HAVE FAILED TO DO. BUT THOSE OF US IN THE ARTS CAN WELL IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE IF AMANDA'S VOICE WAS NOT ON STAGE. WE CAN IMAGINE THE HUGE GAPS IN OUR COLLECTIVE HEALING AND HOPE IF ARTISTS ARE NOT. SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY ARTS PROGRAMS IS OFTEN THREATENED IN PRECARIOUS ROOMS LEFT THOSE NURTURED MANDATORY. AS A YOUNG PERSON. WE KNOW THAT THOSE PROGRAMS EASILY COULD NOT HAVE EXISTED BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT SEEN AS EASE TENSION. WE KNOW THAT TOO MANY IN OUR STATE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. I WANTED TO TAKE THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS ONE EXAMPLE IS ONE POWERFUL YOUNG BOYS BEAUTIFULLY AND SIMPLY DEMONSTRATES THE POWER OF THE ARTS. THIS STORY SPEAKS TO THE CORE OF WHY THE ARTS ARE YOU SICK AND SHALL. NOT OPTIONAL. AND THIS IS WHY OUR ARTS BUSINESSES AND CULTURAL WORKERS CANNOT BE LEFT BEHIND HIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. AS A SECTOR IT CONTRIBUTES SO MUCH TO SO MANY. KOCHAR IS A STRONG SIGNIFIER OF CALIFORNIA'S IDENTITY AS A STATE AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL SUPPORTS LOCAL EFFORTS STRUCTURE IN PROGRAMMING STATEWIDE THROUGH GRANT. PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. S. CALIFORNIA STATE OUR PATIENTS SEE THE COUNCIL CONTINUES TO LEAD EQUITY RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEEDS WE SUPPORT LOCAL ARTS INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROGRAMMING IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE THROUGH GRANTS INITIATIVES AND SERVICES. THE ARTS COUNCIL IS A TRUSTED RESOURCE FOR THOSE MOST AFFECTED MICROBIT NINETEEN IN ACCORDING TO STATE LABOR DATA THE ARTS SECTOR HAS SOME OF THE GREATEST JOB LOSSES NATIONWIDE. STATE EDT DATA SHOWS THAT THE ARTS ENTERTAINMENT RECREATION INDUSTRY SAW A DECREASE OF FORTY POINT 3% IN EMPLOYMENT FROM MARCH TO AUGUST A LARGER IMPACT THAN THE 27% DECREASE SEEN IN THE LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. IT IS GOING TO REPEAT THAT CALIFORNIA. ARTS SECTOR EXPERIENCED- FORTY FORTY THREE DECREASE IN EMPLOYMENT COMPARED TO THE 27% DECREASE IN THE HOSPITALITY SECTOR ACCORDING TO EATING. THERE'S NO DOUBT AT THE ARTS AS A SECTOR HAS REDUCE THE PORTION OF THE IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND I KNOW YOU'LL HEAR MANY MORE DATAPOINTS STORIES DEMONSTRATING THIS TODAY. OUR SECTOR HOWEVER IS VITAL TO THE RELIEF AND RECOVERY EFFORTS OF THE STATE ARTIST SUPPORT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AND COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND REBUILD. THE CMS AFTER DEVASTATING WILDFIRES AND THE SAME NOW. LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL AND HOW WE WORK.

YES THE NEXT YEAR A FEW ITEMS FROM HIS SCHEDULED REMARKS ABOUT THE WORK OF THE COUNCIL QUALITY. YOUR BROWSER WANTED TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THE CAAC STATE BUDGET WAS REDUCED BY MORE THAN 90% IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE. WITH A WIDE REACHING IMPLICATIONS. FROM TWO THOUSAND AND THREE TO TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA WAS THE LAST IN THE NATION IN ARTS FUNDING PER CAPITA. FIFTEEN CENTS. A LEVEL PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF ONE DOLLAR AND THIRTY FIVE CENTS AT THAT TIME. THE FIELD STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBERS THOSE TIMES IN THE TREMENDOUS LOSS THAT IMPACTED SO MANY COMMUNITIES PARTICULARLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ANY OTHER FUNDERS TO TAKE PLACE AND- BUT WHAT THE ARTS COUNCIL HAD BEEN DOING. IN TRULY IMPACT IS STILL VISIBLE TODAY IN MANY WAYS. IN RECENT YEARS THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. WE'VE BEEN REPORTING A POSITION AS A STATE WIDE FUND IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. WHEN THE COUNCIL HELD ITS FIRST VIRTUAL MEETING LAST APRIL THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THE ARTS SECTOR WAS IMMEDIATELY APPARENT. THIS LED THE COUNCIL TO PRIORITISE CONTINUITY OF SERVICES WHILE PIVOTING ASK NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE FIELD. IN MAY. THE COUNCIL VOTED TO ESTABLISH A ONE MILLION DOLLAR RAPID RELIEF GRANT FOR FUNDING INDIVIDUAL ARTISTS. THESE ARTISTS REPRESENTED SUFFICIENTLY COMMUNITIES MOST HIGHLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC ADDRESSING RACIAL INEQUITIES. IN RECORD TIME THE FUNDS WERE IN THE HANDS OF ARGUS IN THIS YEAR THE COUNCIL WAS IN THE PROCESS ESTABLISH ANOTHER ROUND OF SIMILAR SUPPORT. THE COUNCIL ALSO DISTRIBUTED MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL CURES ACT FUNDING THROUGHOUT OUR COUNTY ARTS PARTNERS. MORE THAN FORTY COUNTIES OPTED TO DEVELOP RE GRANTING PROGRAMS FUNDED ARTS ORGANISATIONS SERVING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MOST ISSUE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED MY CODE NINETEEN. AS A QUICKLY GOT TO WORK ON THEIR NEXT GRANT CYCLE WHICH IS CURRENTLY OPEN FOR APPLICATIONS. WE HAD MULTIPLE PUBLIC LISTENING SESSIONS LED BY THE COUNCIL TO DEVELOP NEW GENERAL OPERATING SUPPORT AND DIRECT GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS A SHIFT FROM THE ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN PROJECT BASED FUNDING PRIORITIES. IT IS TALK ABOUT THE ARTS COUNCIL'S RACER RACIAL EQUITY PRIORITIES. HER FATHER WANTED TO SHARE THAT PART OF THE ROLE OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS INSURING THAT THE ARTS OF FOR PRIORITIZE HIGHER STATE. THIS IS REFLECTED IN OUR NEW MISSION STATEMENT STRENGTHENING ARTS AND CULTURE AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION AS A TOOL TO CULTIVATE. A BETTER POPCORN YEAH. AND RACIAL EQUITY STATEMENT AFTER A YEAR LONG PUBLIC PROCESS. WITH THIS REMARK THE WAS THE AC COMMITTED TO ACTIVELY ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO EQUITY PARTICIPATION FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THIS REQUIRES LISTENING CAREFULLY TO STAKEHOLDERS IN MAKING AND COMMUNICATING DECISIONS AT SOME FACETS OF THE PUBLIC MAY RECESSED. THIS PUBLIC PROCESS CONFIRMS THAT RACIAL INJUSTICE MUST BE PRIORITIZED AS IT IS THE MOST PERVASIVE AND ENTRENCHED FORM INJUSTICE PERMEATING THE INSTITUTIONS AND SYSTEMS THAT EVERYONE LAST ACCESS. OUR EQUITY GOAL IS TO CREATE A SENSE OF BELONGING IT IS SO PROBABLE IT IS UNIVERSALLY EXPERIENCED. PURSUIT OF RACIAL JUSTICE BENEFITS EVERYONE BY TAKING CRITICAL IT SYSTEMS OF OPPRESSION. SYSTEMS THAT UNDERCUTS. ROSS MULTIPLE DEMOGRAPHICS CONDITIONS AND EXPERIENCES WELL IN SOME WAYS A PANDEMIC IS INTERRUPTED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR NEW FRAMEWORK IS FAIRLY BROUGHT TO LIGHT THIS PAST YEAR REINFORCE THE COMMITMENT WE MADE.

I WILL TRY TO BRING IT HOME FOR YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR THE PASSION AND COMMITMENT. YOU'VE SHOWN HER AMAZING ARTS CULTURE CREATIVITY IN CALIFORNIA. MY NAME IS JULIE BAKER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA ARTS ADVOCATES AND CALIFORNIANS FOR THE ARTS THE STATE RIGHT ARTS AND CREATIVE INDUSTRY ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. MY PRONOUNS ARE SHE HER HERS. AND COMING NEED TO YOU TODAY. FROM THE LAND OF THE NEVADA CITY RANCHERIA NISSAN TRIBE WE'RE CURRENTLY FIGHTING TO HAVE THE FEDERAL RECOGNITION RESTORED. LET ME START BY SHARING A QUOTE BUT ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS TONI MORRISON THAT I THINK EXEMPLIFIES THIS MOMENT PERSPECTIVE. QUOTE THIS IS PRECISELY THE TIME WHEN ARTISTS GO TO WORK THERE IS NO TIME FOR DESPAIR NO PLACE FOR SELF PITY. NO NEED FOR SILENCE NO ROOM FOR FEAR. WE SPEAK WE WRITE WE DO LANGUAGE THAT IS HOW CIVILISATIONS HE'LL AND QUOTE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MORE IMPORTANT AND RELEVANT TIME FOR THE ARTS AND FOR ARTISTS TO GO TO WORK TO HEAL AND PROVIDE EMPATHY HOPE ENJOY. FOR A NATION DIVIDED AND SICK. IF IT ANYTIME DURING THE PANDEMIC YOU I'VE LOOKED UP TO THE WORK OF ARTISTS TO HELP I NEED. FOR EVEN A LITTLE DISTRACTION FROM THE GROUNDHOG DAY NATURE OF SHELTERING AT HOME. THEN YOU UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE OF THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS. HELLO WE HAVE LOW OR ARE FIRST. INCLUDE TO A YEAR ICE. WE HAVE FAILED TO SUPPORT RECOGNIZE AND TRULY VALUED THEM. PARTICULARLY FINANCIALLY FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS AS OUR NATION'S SECOND RESPONDERS. WE ARE HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR HELP IN FINALLY FINALLY ENDING THE HISTORIC. UNDER CAPITALIZATION OF THE ARTS WHILE ALSO CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO EMERGE AS A LEADER IN FOSTERING THE- THRIVING CREATIVE INDUSTRIES. NOW IS THE TIME TO PROCLAIM ARTS ARE ESSENTIAL. AND TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT THAT CAN TRULY MAKE A DIFFERENCE. WITH THE EXPECTED FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS THIS ONE TIME BONUS OF BONDS SHOULD IN PART BE DEDICATED. TO RESTORING THE CREATIVE WORKFORCE BUSINESSES AND NONPROFITS. CONTRIBUTE SO MUCH. TO EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA AN INDUSTRY THAT REPRESENTS OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS. AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY. ACCESS ARTS WILL HELP US SURVIVE AND OVERCOME THE PANDEMIC AND AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS CRISIS WILL BE A CHANGE SOCIETY. INVESTMENT IN THE ARTS NEED TO BE PART OF A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO DEAL WITH THE AFTERMATH OF THE PANDEMIC. REBUILDING CALIFORNIA WILL REQUIRE INGENUITY INCLUDING A RECKONING OF SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS SUCH AS RACISM AND ECONOMIC DISPARITY. THE ARTS SECTOR OFFERS RESOURCEFULNESS AND INNOVATION OUR VERY NATURE WE ARE CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVERS WHO WILL SHOW UP IN SERVICE TO REBUILDING OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE WONDERFUL MODELS ACROSS THE STATE OF INTEGRATING SKILLED CREATIVE WORKERS INTO MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS. PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT TRAINING AND MENTORSHIP DEVELOPING THOUGHT PROVOKING AND ORIGINAL WORKS OF ART TO BUILD EMPATHY AND BELONGING IN INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES. TO UTILIZE VENUES AND PERFORMERS UNTIL WE CAN GATHER SAFELY AGAIN. IT IS TIME TO BRING THIS TO SCALE ALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO GATHER THE ARTS WILL REIGNITE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE FILLING A RESTAURANTS HOTELS. AND THEATERS TO CAPACITY. BUT ARTS AND CULTURAL. INSTITUTIONS MUST NOT BE ALLOWED TO. IF WE SEEK TO RECOVER AND REVITALIZE OUR% COMMUNITY. WE ARE KEYS TO IN OUR ECONOMY I. AND SO FABRIC SUPPORTING THE ARTS HOUSE FOR IMMEDIATE SOCIAL SERVICES OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER TO INCREASE FUNDING AND STAFFING FOR THE STATE ARTS AGENCY THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. WE JUST HEARD WE NEED TO FIND THE BUDGET TO AT LEAST ONE DOLLAR PER CAPITA PER PERSON WE ARE CURRENTLY AT SIXTY SIX CENTS PER PERSON BY COMPARISON. NEW YORK INVEST TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTY ONE CENTS AND MINNESOTA. OVER SEVEN DOLLARS IF CALIFORNIA IS TRULY GOING TO BE THE STATE OF THE ARTS WE MUST DEMONSTRATE COMMITMENT TO ITS SURVIVAL AND SUSTAINABILITY. TODAY YOU WILL HEAR STORIES RESILIENCY AND INNOVATION IN THE FACE OF SHUT DOWN. AND HOW ARE CONTINUES TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO PROVIDE SOCIAL COHESION AND HEALING WHEN YOU GET THE MOST HOWEVER WHAT YOU ALSO HERE. IS HOW THIS CRISIS HAS ALREADY HAS BEEN ALREADY FINANCIALLY FRAGILE INDUSTRY MUCH WORSE. EVERY ASPECT OF THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN HIT SOME OF BETTER ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESERVES SOME OF ACCESS TO PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY OTHERS HAVE USED PUBLIC RELIEF FUNDS TO KEEP GOING. BUT NO ONE HAD IT IN THEIR STRATEGIC CORPORATE BUSINESS PLAN HOW TO SURVIVE IF WE CANNOT EARN REVENUE FOR TWELVE TO EIGHT EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TAUGHT IN BUSINESS SCHOOL THE FUNDING WE'VE RECEIVED THUS FAR FIRST SECTOR FOR BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SOME STATE AND LOCAL FUNDS HAVE HAD KEPT US ON LIFE SUPPORT. BUT WILL NOT BE ENOUGH FOR US TO RETURN TO WORK AND RE OPEN ARTS SAFELY. PHILANTHROPY HAS STEPPED UP OF THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL AS YOU HEARD FROM BEACON ECONOMICS IS RUNNING DRY THERE'S ALSO CURRENTLY NO PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY STATEWIDE FOR ARTS AND CULTURE. THE ONLY FUNDING SOURCE OR TO BE AVAILABLE IN EVERY COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. IS THE STATE ARTS AGENCY WE CALL UPON THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTOR TO INVEST IN THIS WORK FORCE TO RE BUILD BACK A BETTER CALIFORNIA ALL. LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO DESCRIBE WHO ARE ARTS AND CULTURE WORKERS TO HAVE AN IDEA AND THIS COMES FROM OUR AMERICANS FOR THE ARTS. THE IMPACT HAS BEEN SIMPLY YOUR- THE END 2215% OF CREATIVE WORKERS SAY THEY DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER FOR DRINKING OR WASHING ONE IN TEN CREATIVE WORKERS OF EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AND ONE OF THREE IS BEEN ACED WITH THE THREAT OF EVICTION OVER 50% OF CREATIVE WORKERS HAVE EXPERIENCED FOOD INSECURITY AND HELP AND 55% OF CREATIVE WORKERS HAVE NO SAVINGS TO FALL BACK ON. GREAT WORKERS ARE SUFFERING FROM A LACK OF THE MOST BASIC HUMAN NEEDS RIGHT NOW IN FACT- THERE'S SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE WORKFORCE HONEST AND ARTISTS WHO IDENTIFY AS BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT THE WHITE ARTISTS AND WANTS A LARGER. PERCENTAGE OF THEIR TWENTY TWENTY INCOME- IT CALIFORNIA'S PICTURES SAME WITH ONE THIRD OF THE SECTOR OUT OF WORK. MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS. AS YOU HEARD THEIR PARTS WORKERS MORE THAN THREE TIMES LIKE THE STUFF AND LLOYD PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE HAS CREATED A LIFELINE THIRTY THRESHOLD COULD PANDEMIC COULD TAKE ON THE SECTOR. YOU KNOW I WAS GIVEN TEN MINUTES- BY THE WORK I'M SORRY WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA CUT SOME TIME JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY ON OUR LIST IN AND WE UNDERSTAND BUT I REALLY HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT I'D LIKE TO SHARE THAN ON THE PURCHASE OF SPECIFICALLY AT LEAST GET TO WHAT WE ARE ASKING OF THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE VERY SPECIFICS MAYBE THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. WE HAVE NO GUIDELINES RIGHT NOW FOR LIVE PERFORMANCES WE URGE THAT ARE YOU TO HELP US GET THOSE GUIDELINES IN COLLABORATION WITH INDUSTRY EXPERTS YOU WILL HEAR FROM TODAY. WE HAVE TO PROVIDE FUNDING AND RESOURCES TO REOPEN ARE SAFELY IN THE FORM OF LOANS OR GRANTS OR AUDIENCE PERFORMER COBIT TESTING IN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS DIRECTOR BIT VENUES IT MAY NOT HAVE THE VENTILATION SYSTEMS. TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES TO UTILIZE VENUES FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA CREATED FOR PILOT PROGRAM AND EXPAND ITS ONGOING LEGISLATION INCREASE FUNDING FOR MULTIPLE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE AN INCREASE OF GOVERNORS- ALLOCATION TO CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS TO FIFTY MILLION. AND WE ALSO AGREED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA GREEK PRIME GRANT PROGRAMS THAT IT NEEDS TO BE MORE ON TREND MORE TRANSPARENCY TO SEE WHO'S ACTUALLY GETTING THOSE FUNDS. FINALLY WE URGE POLICY MAKERS TO CONTINUE DEDICATED STATE AND FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR. CREATIVE INDUSTRIES IF AND WHEN SECOND RELEASE WHICH INCLUDES STATE FUNDING FOR DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM. FOR TO CREATE A BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE STILL CLOSE INCLUDING THE LOCAL ARTS AGENCIES BUT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND I WILL HAVE TO PULL A LIST OF THINGS- SUBMITTED FOR YOUR REVIEW. THANK YOU. M. THANK YOU WE KNOW YOU. ALL OF THE PANEL HAVE. PREPARED FOR THE TIME GIVEN. AND WE DO. WANT TO. YOUR WORK ON THAT. ALL OF YOUR REPORTS AND GRAPHS WILL BE PUT UP ON OUR- OUR SITE. FOR FURTHER REFERENCE. AND SO AGAIN AS THE CHIR OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE DO WANT TO BE COGNISANT OF WHAT. REMARKS ARE BEING MADE AHEAD OF YOU SO IF THERE ARE SOME SIMILARITIES. IF YOU COULD EDIT YOUR REMARKS. TO SOME F THE KEY POINTS THAT POSSIBLY HAVEN'T ALREADY BEEN SAID. AND AGAIN BECOME A NARRATIVE. SO THAT- I THINK AS AS MANY OF US HERE LISTEN WE CAN SAY. LOOK LILIA GONZALEZ CHAVEZ SPOKE. ABOUT JUSTICE AND SPOKE ABOUT JUSTICE IN THE ARTS AND I THINK THAT THAT TELLS THE NARRATIVE. BECAUSE THE MORE WE SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE. AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN BE OUT THERE WITH THE POLICE TO CALIFORNIANS- THAT ARTS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THEY'RE REALLY ABOUT ARTISTS WHO ARE. SUPPORTING OUR ECONOMY. BUT THAT DOES FINISH OUR FIRST PANEL. AND DO WE HAVE ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HERE THAT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- AND ALSO I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER- PALM HARBOR- ASSEMBLY. NAZARIAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO- COMMAND- THE LAST COMMENTS MADE BY MISS BAKER- FIRST OF ALL ON HER POINT ABOUT A DOLLAR PER PERSON PER CAPITA INVESTMENT I THINK THAT'S A CRITICAL INVESTMENT THAT HAS BEEN SORELY LACKING IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING FOR. CALIFORNIA ARTS COMMISSION IT HAD PRETTY MUCH STALLED FOR ABOUT. TWELVE YEARS- IF I IF I'M REMEMBERING IT CORRECTLY EITHER TWELVE OR ELEVEN YEARS FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND- ONTO A TWO THOUSAND ONE TILL ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWELVE- IN MY FIRST TERM OF OFFICE I INTRODUCED A BILL TO EXACTLY DO THAT AND PUT IN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION- INTO THE BUDGET ON AN ONGOING BASIS DOLLAR PER CAPITA BASIS- THAT ENDED UP BEING NEGOTIATED DOWN INTO A I THINK A FIVE MILLION INCREASE AND SLOWLY IT'S BEEN INCREASING SINCE THEN. BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THIS PUSH AGAIN ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF CRISIS WHEN IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE SEE TO WHAT EXTENT OUR STATE IS DEPENDENT ON THE ENTERTAINMENT ECONOMY- CREATIVE ARTS ECONOMY I SHOULD SAY- AND THE SECOND POINT SHE MADE ABOUT- THE GUIDELINES THERE'S SO MANY GUIDELINES SORELY MISSING BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN. GOING AS WE'VE AS AS THIS PANDEMIC HAS EVOLVED AND THE VIRUS HAS INVOLVED AND THE SURGES HAVE BEEN. RECURRING WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE AND MAKE THINGS AS WE GO ALONG- AND SO. FROM THE FALL OUT OF THAT PROCESS WE SEE THAT THEY'RE SAYING THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SORELY MISSING AND SOME OF THESE THINGS MIGHT NOT BE AS A PARENT IN SOME PARTS OF THE DISTRICT OF THE STATE BUT IN PLACES LIKE MYSELF OR MY DISTRICT OR SEVERAL OTHER COLLEAGUES DISTRICTS HERE WHEN YOU HAVE AN ABUNDANCE OF NINETY NINE SEAT THEATERS OR- A PLACES THAT- CAPTURED- A LOT OF THESE UNSPOKEN OR SMALLER SCALE ECONOMY. BUT VERY MUCH PRESENT- CONDUCTIVITY SECT THE DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE ARTS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE REGULATIONS IN PLACE SO THAT PEOPLE GUIDELINES IN PLACE SO THAT THESE INDUSTRIES CAN KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING RE SITUATED BACK IN THE ECONOMY SO- THANK YOU FOR MAKING THOSE CRITICAL POINTS AND I'M HAPPY TO. OFFER MY SUPPORT AGAIN- ON THESE FRONTS AND WORK WITH YOU AS WELL ALONG WITH OTHER PANELISTS AND MY COLLEAGUES HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THOSE REMARKS AND AGAIN TO- JULIE BAKER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE ARTS. I TOO WROTE DOWN THE WORD GUIDELINES AS I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR COMMENTS AND ALSO THE UNDER- WHEN YOU MADE THAT REMARK ABOUT- OUR STATE IN FUNDING COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IT IS- REALLY DISAPPOINTING- THAT. WE OUGHT LAGGED FAR BEHIND WHEN WE'RE ACTUALLY KNOW WHEN. AS THE ICONIC STATE BUT AGAIN IN MY AREA HAVING TWO MAJOR THEM THEME PARKS AND DISNEY DISNEYLAND AND KNOTT'S BERRY FARM. IT ISN'T JUST THE THEME PARK ATTRACTION BUT THEY IN TURN HIRE MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF ENTERTAINERS AND PERFORMERS. IN THOSE THEME PARKS SO WEKNOW THAT THOSE LOSS OF JOBS OR SERIOUS. OUT WITH THAT I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL AND AGAIN THANK OUR FIRST PANEL FOR A VERY- WHY A BIT OF. AND THAT REALLY A SET THE STAGE FOR WHERE WE ARE AND TO MOVE INTO OUR NEXT TO PANDA WHICH IS IMPACTS AN ACT ACTIVITY. IN THE FIELD SO HOUSES REALLY PLAYING OUT IN THE FIELD OUR FIRST SPEAKER WE HAVE. IS KRISTIN SAID BROKER WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE- WELCOME CHRISTIAN. GOOD MORNING ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME THAT'S ME OKAY GREAT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR- AS YOU NOTED I'M CHRISTIAN CICADA DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE AND I THINK YEAH YOU AND ALL THE MEMBERS FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK AT THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF ARTS AND CULTURE SERVES AS THE LOCAL ARTS AGENCY FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY THE MOST POPULOUS AND ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE COUNTIES IN THE NATION- IN THE LARGEST STATE IN THE NATION WE HAVE MORE THAN TEN MILLION RESIDENTS- AND A HUGE WELL GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AS WELL AS CULTURAL AND ETHNIC AND RACIAL DIVERSITY- IN OUR COUNTY. AND AS SUCH- WE OFTEN ARE SORT OF AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING ALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR US AS A LOCAL ARTS AGENCY OUR ROLE IS TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES IN ARTS AND CULTURE AND INVEST IN EARLY COUNTIES CULTURAL LIFE. WE DO THAT THROUGH A NUMBER OF CORE AREAS FOR EXAMPLE GRANTS TO HUNDREDS OF ARTS NONPROFITS AND SOCIAL SERVICE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THE ARTS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT CREATIVE CAREER PATHWAYS INCLUDING THE PAID ARTS INTERNSHIP PROGRAM COMMISSIONING ARTISTS FOR CIVIC OUR CIVIC SPACES ROBUST ARTS EDUCATION WHICH IS. SO CRITICAL TO ALL OF OUR EIGHTY ONE DIFFERENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MORE THAN A MILLION DIFFERENT STUDENTS AS WELL AS PRODUCING RESEARCH IN THE ARTS LEADING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE L. A. COUNTY CULTURAL EQUITY AND INCLUSION INITIATIVE AND USING CROSS SECTOR STRATEGIES TO ADVANCE THE ARTS ACROSS DIFFERENT SECTORS. WE'RE PROUD TO SAY WE ARE STATE AND LOCAL PARTNER OF THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL. SO I WILL NOT REPEAT WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAID JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WE FIND OURSELVES AT THIS. MOMENT IN TIME AS A MOMENT OF CRISIS. TO BE HEALTHCARE. IS A COURSE A HEALTH CRISIS. OF EPIC PROPORTIONS HAS LED US TO A RESULTING ECONOMIC CRISIS AND WE'VE SEEN DURING THIS TIME A CRISIS OF RECKONING WITH RACIAL INEQUITY. AS OTHERS HAVE NOTED THESE HAVE CAUSED COMBINED- AN INTENSE AND VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FIELD SHUTTING DOWN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THE ARTS AND CULTURAL SECTOR- BUT ALSO DECIMATING MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND REALLY ROUGH. STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT WERE THERE BEFORE SUCH AS THE UNDER CAPITALIZATION OF THE FIELD SUCH AS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT IN INEQUITY ALONG AT INCOME AND RACIAL LINES INTO PUBLIC HEALTH. WELL BEING AND OTHERS BUT I'M GOING TO ADD A FOURTH CRISIS FOR US TO THINK ABOUT. AND THAT IS CRISIS HAPPENING NATIONWIDE. A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. AND NOW WHAT ALL OF THESE HAVE LED US TO. A MOMENT. OF CRISIS AND RECKONING IN RESPONSE IT'S ALSO A MOMENT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RESPOND FOR US TO RECOVER AND FOR US TO RE. WHAT'S OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ARTS AND CREATIVE SECTOR LOOKS LIKE AND REIMAGINE THE RESILIENCY. OF THE ARTS AND CREATIVE SECTOR. SO JUST BRIEFLY AT THE TOP OF PART OF WHAT WE DID IS OUR RESPONSE INCLUDED CONVENING IN THE ARTS SECTOR WE HAVE OTHER LOCAL ARTS AGENCIES ARTS SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS GRANTEES WE PIVOT OUR PROGRAMS TO VIRTUAL OUT WE XCELERATED GRANT PAYMENTS TO GET THAT CRITICAL FUNDING PUBLIC FUNDING OUT THE DOOR. WE'RE LIAISING WITH THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO HELP SUPPORT AND INFORM THEIR EFFORTS- AND HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE ARE TO CREATE A COMEDY AS WELL AS SHARED THEIR INFORMATION AND THOSE IMPORTANT PROTOCOLS AND GUIDES OUT TO THE FIELD. CREATED DIGITAL RESOURCE CENTERS AND PARTICIPATED ON L. A. COUNTY ECONOMIC RESILIENCY TASK FORCE SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME THROUGH THAT TASK FORCE ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COME FORWARD LIKE THE ADOPTION OF A MODEL COUNTY WHITE CULTURAL POLICY THAT CENTERS THE NOTION OF CULTURAL EQUITY FOR ALL. AND THE IDEA OF THE ARTS AS BEING A SOLUTION ACROSS SECTORS LIKE EDUCATION. JUSTICE REFORM THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT AND ANTI RACISM AND BELONGING. YEAH WE ALSO WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE CARE ACT DOLLARS AND SO WE HAD AN L. A. COUNTY KOBE RELIEF FUND WITH TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE GIVEN OUT TO THE FIELD I WANT TO TELL YOU A COUPLE OF THINGS ABOUT HOW THEIR RESPONSE WHEN. WE WERE ABLE TO GET THOSE FUNDS OUT AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU WE WERE ABLE TO SUPPORT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE AFFECTED BY COPING WITH THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS EQUITY 95% OF THE DOLLARS WE GIVE OUT. WITH A SMALL MID SIZED ORGANIZATIONS WITH A BUDGET OF FIFTEEN MILLION AND UNDER KNOWING BILLS ARE MOST ROOTED OFTEN IN OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HAVE LESS ACCESS TO FUNDING. BUT WHAT WE SAW IS THAT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS APPLYING. THE FORTY OF THEM HI MY WHEN THEY PERCENT SAID THEY WERE GOING TO USE. THOSE DOLLARS FOR PAPER. AND KEEP JOB. WE ALSO SAW THE COLLECT UP. THE THREE. OF MORE THAN HUNDRED OR- APPLYING. THE LOS. AND AN ANTI. EXPENSES THAT THEY CLAIMED TOTAL NOT TWELVE MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WHAT IS THE IMPACT THAT THEY WERE CLAIMING AND THIS WAS AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY SO AGAIN. WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH EVEN A LONGER TIME LOSSES SO IT REALLY SHOWS THE NEED. DEEPLY GRATEFUL IN THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS RECOGNIZING THE ARTS SETOR INCLUDING THAT AND SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF BUT THE NEED IS STILL GREAT AND CONTINUING. WE'VE SEEN SO MANY OF AND LAY OFF STAFF. AND AND OTHER EXAMPLES OR SHUT DOWN OR TRYING TO PIVOT TO VIRTUAL HELP OUR COMMUNITIES WITHOUT BEING PAID. OR WITHOUT SUPPORT. SO WE SEE THIS MOMENT AS A TIME NOT TURN AWAY FROM THE ARTS BUT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE ARTS AS A VITAL. AND CREATIVE SECTOR THAT'S IMPORTANT TO OUR SHARED PROSPERITY IN OUR COLLECTIVE. RECOVERY HE- AS WE NOTED IN OUR ECONOMY. BUT ALSO THE ARTS DISTRIBUTE TO WILL BE COMMUNITIES. AND STUDIES HAVE PROVED. AS WELL AS EDUCATE ING ARGUES. YES I'M SORRY SAY YEAH WE HAVE ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS LEFT HERE. OKAY THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT SO I WILL JUST END UP BY SAYING A THREE OUR OUR AND WE HOPE DEVON THE- OF THE PUBLIC. AND THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR BUT ALSO KNOW THAT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. AND PRIVATE SECTOR IS CRITICAL AS WELL AND AGAIN NOTING THAT THE ARTS ARE VITAL ACROSS SECTORS FROM CAREER PATHWAYS. TO JUSTICE REFORM EDUCATION WELL BEING AND SO THE ARTS ARE A VITAL PART OF RELIEF BUT ALSO RECOVERY AND SUPPORTING RE OPENING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES AT D. III CANNOT BE OVERSTATED SO ALL OF THAT WITH AN EQUITY LENS. IS CRITICAL AND THINKING ABOUT THE ARTS AS PART OF NOT ONLY A WONDERFUL SECTOR BUT OUR SHARED PROSPERITY WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING O WORKING WITH THE STATE WE'RE EXCITED TO BE A PARTNER AND TO REALLY GET TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE ARTISTS FOR MUSICIANS. ADVOCACY GROUPS AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR ENTITIES I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME AND HAPPY TO SHARE ANY INFORMATION A OFFERING THAT I SPOKE ABOUT TODAY. THEY YOU SO MUCH KRISTIN SAKODA WE APPRECIATE THOSE. AND AGAIN AS WE CONTINUE WE STILL HAVE MANY MANY PRESENTERS I HAVE NOT COUNTED A MALL BUT WE HAVE MANY PRESENTERS AND AGAIN. I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THE LEGISLATORS THAT ARE HERE LISTENING AND PARTICIPATING. WE ARE CHAMPIONS FOR THE ARTS WE WANT TO SEE EVERY ADDITIONAL DYNAMIC POSSIBLE PUT INTO THIS BUDGET WE WANT TO SEE RECOVERY SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU OUR SOME SOLUTION- THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

I HAVE RURAL INNER SPECIALLY OR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES I LIKE WE SAW WITH AND CRAWFORD REPORTING FROM MARQUITA AND I MIGHT BE HAVING SIMILAR ISSUES HERE. OUT ON THE COAST. MORE INFORMATION BUT THE ONLY ACCESS FOR INTERNET IS EITHER SATELLITE. OR THE USE OF MY CELL PHONE AS A HOT SPOT. I MEAN THIS IS NOT AN UNCOMMON EXPERIENCE HERE UP NORTH- ADDED ISSUES WITHIN THAT ARE THE ELDERS WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AND MORE LIKELY TO NEED TO BE CONNECTED TO OTHERS. HOW DO WE GET ARTS PROGRAMS. AND PROGRAMMING. TO ALL PARTS OF OUR STATE- WHEN CAME INTO JOB HAD CAN. OUR OVER SPUR PROGRAMMING AND- TO.

THIS CREATED A STRUGGLE TO GIVE ARTISTS SPACES TO SHOWCASE OUR WORK AND HAVING TO WORK CREATIVELY WITH IN STRICT CONSTRAINTS. ON WHAT I'M HEARING FROM OUR OTHER LOCAL ARTISTS WORK SOMEONE ALONG WITH WHAT I'M SEEING MYSELF- LOOKING INTO THIS NEXT YEAR. IS THAT THERE'S A LIMITED ACCESS TO FUNDING LIKE. OTHER OTHER PEERS HAVE SAID- THERE'S A LOT OF FUNDING NEED FOR NORMAN CAL. BUT LARGER MORE. AREAS RISK THIRTY FIVE. MORE EASILY US FOR THEIR NORTH OF FUNDING THAT COMES INTO OUR ROUTINE STATE IN A REAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OUR ARTS ORGANIZATIONS WORK TOGETHER AND EMPLOY ARTISTS FIRST. WE NEED TO MAKE THE ARTS ACCESSIBLE AND GETTING MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF ARTISTS- I HAVE TO BRING MY ARTWORK INTO THE COMMUNITY WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE WITH OUR PROBLEM SOLVING. THERE'S A STRAIGHT ZERO COMMUNITY BEING ABLE TO MAKE DO WITH WHAT WE HAD AND STILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THINGS GOING. THE ARTS ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES OUR CULTURES ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE VIEW REYES OF BEING AN APPEALING. AND SAID YES THANK YOU FOR MY WE'RE GIVING ME THIS TIME AND- YET. THANK YOU BRITNEY.

SO WE ARE GOING TO BE THE BROKEN RECORD ON GUIDELINES IF NOTHING ELSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WILL NOW MOVE TO JAIL- JOANNE DESMOND THE SYSTEM BUSINESS AGENT NOW FOR THE INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYEES LOCAL SIXTEEN. SO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES. GOOD MORNING I HOPE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR ME. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE HEAR YOU AND SEE YOU WELCOME. GREAT THANK YOU DO YOUR CHAIR QUIRKS SILVA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOANNE DESMOND AND I REPRESENT AYE ATSC LOCAL SIXTEEN STATE CHANCE IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WE ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA IATSE COUNCIL WE ARE DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY AND YOUR RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR SITUATION. WHEN KOBE NINETEEN HIT ALMOST A YEAR AGO STATE CHANCE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO THEIR WORK DISAPPEAR LITERALLY OVERNIGHT. CARPENTERS RIGGERS PAINTERS AUDIOVISUAL TECHNICIANS ELECTRICIANS WARDROBE HAIR AND MAKEUP HAS BEEN LEFT DEVASTATED DUE TO THIS CRISIS CURRENTLY OUR WORKFORCE IS AT. 95% UNEMPLOYMENT. JUST THE CITY IS CALLOUSED ISN'T UNDERSTATEMENT. WHAT IS THE NAME THEIR UNDER THEIR APPOINTMENT IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG FOR SO MANY. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR MEMBERS. HAVE ALSO LOST THEIR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE DUE TO LACK OF CONTRIBUTIONS. MANY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO MOVE OUT OF STATE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY. AND WE'RE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO PAY BACK RENT. ALL THIS IS HAPPENING WELL THEY ARE FORCED TO DECIDE IF THEY STILL HAVE A FUTURE IN A CAREER THEY LOVE AND HAVE DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA MEDIJI HAS PROVED TO BE CHALLENGING AND FRUSTRATING TO FAR TOO MANY WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS. FOR THEM UNEMPLOYMENT. IS CURRENTLY YOUR ONLY SOURCE OF INCOME. LASTLY AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THE EFFECT THIS HAS TAKEN ON A MEMBERS MENTAL HEALTH CANNOT BE OVERLOOKED. SADLY WE HAVE PROOF OF THAT REALITY. SINCE WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED SEVERAL SUICIDES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND THE DISASTROUS SITUATION IT HAS CREATED. I EIGHTY IS THE LOCAL SIXTEEN HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY TO ASSIST OUR MEMBERS DURING THIS TIME WE ARE HELPING THEM NAVIGATE EDT WE WRITE READ RELEASED LETTERS TO LANDLORDS WE CONTRIBUTE TO AND STAFF FOOD BANK DRIVES. YET DUE TO THE FACT WE ARE UNION FIVE OH ONE C. FIVE WE HAVE REMADE IN ELIGIBLE FOR CRUCIAL FUNDS FROM THE PAYMENT PROTECTION PROGRAM THE EFFORTS TO INCLUDE UNIONS IN THE LAST STIMULUS BILL WERE BLOCKED. LOCAL SIXTEEN IS A LABOR UNION COMMITTED TO ASSISTING NOT JUST OUR MEMBERS BUT ALL WORKING PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY COVERT NINETEEN. HOWEVER WE NEED PRELIMINARY GUIDELINES FOR THE CRITERIA WE WILL NEED FOR LIVE ENTERTAINMENT TO REOPEN. WELL THE FEDERAL STIMULUS PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL THEY ARE FAR FROM ENOUGH WE NEED ECONOMIC SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. WE NEED TO CREATE NON REFUNDABLE TAX CREDITS FOR BUSINESSES TO COVER THE COST OF CODE NINETEEN WORKPLACE SAFETY COMPLIANCE. WE NEED UNIONS GROUP WE'RE A FEW PEOPLE PROGRAM. WE NEED TO PRESERVE OUR PRESERVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE BE A 1100% FEDERAL COCOPAH SUBSIDY FOR WORKERS. WE ARE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT THESE AND OTHER POSITION- PROVISIONS ARE IN THE NEXT TO ME IT WAS BUILT. THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR OUR EFFORTS WOULD BE INVALUABLE IT WOULD HELP US AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE THE PERFORMING ARTS MUSIC AND LIVE ENTERTAINMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE ECONOMIC AS WELL AS CULTURAL WELL BEING. OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING. THAT THE SOONER WE CAN GET THE SECTOR BACK TO WORK THE SOONER OUR STATE CAN BEGIN STRONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY. WELL FACING ALL THIS I EIGHTY LOCAL SIXTEEN AND OUR MEMBERS ARE READY TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. STAGEHANDS ARE ONE OF THE MOST VERSATILE LABOR FORCES IN THE COUNTRY. THE CALIFORNIAATSC COUNCIL HAS REACHED OUT TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO OFFER OUR ASSISTANCE IN THE SETTING UP OF LARGE SCALE VACCINATION SITES AT VARIOUS VENUES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA.

WHERE POSSIBLE- BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEND THE MESSAGE THAT WE NEED TO REOPEN WITH GUIDELINES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT DOES AND THAT SECOND PANEL WE NEXT TAB OR THIRD PANEL WHICH IS RESTART THE ARTS RE OPENING SAFELY BEFORE WE BEGAN I KNOW THAT OUR- AKIS DOES HAVE A CALL AT NOON SO WE WILL BE LOSING SOME OF OUR MEMBERS SO I APOLOGIZE. TO US SOME OF THE SPEAKERS IF YOU SEEN MY URGENCY AND BREVITY IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T VALUE YOUR COMMENTS I JUST WANT OUR MEMBERS TO GET AS MUCH OF. YOUR COMMENTS AS POSSIBLE BUT WE WILL CONTINUE AFTERNOON. EVEN IF SOME OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE TO LEAVE SO DO WE HAVE ANY OF OUR MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE THAT HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT THEY ONE MIGHT ALL RIGHT WE WILL MOVE TO THE NEXT THIRD. UP CAMEL AND WE HAVE EIGHT PRESENTERS ON HERE. AND THIS IS TITLE RESTART THE ARTS RE OPENING SAFELY WHICH HAS BEEN OUR GOAL FROM DAY ONE. AND WE ARE GONNA START WITH MARK THE DAM SAID WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE- THEATRICAL PRODUCERS A LEAGUE OF LOS ANGELES MARK THE- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INCLUDING ME IN THIS MORNING'S HEARING AND FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THE ARTS YES MY NAME IS MARTHA DENSON I AM THE BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE THEATRICAL PRODUCERS LEAGUE OF LOS ANGELES WHICH IS A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF SMALL AND MID SIZE NONPROFIT THEATERS. WE ARE YOUNG JUST UNDER TEN YEARS OLD BUT TOGETHER OUR MEMBER ORGANISATIONS FUEL THE ENGINE THAT THAT THAT DRIVES THE DREAMS OF EMERGING AND BY PARK ARTISTS WHO NEED A PLACE WHERE THEIR VOICES CAN BE HEARD. FOR THEIR WORK CAN BE CHAMPION AND WHERE THEY CAN MAKE CONNECTIONS AND ADVANCE CAREERS WITHOUT ENCOUNTERING THE PAY WALL OF CASTING DIRECTOR WORKSHOPS OR EXPENSIVE SHOWCASES. SHORTLY AFTER THAT THE PANDEMIC BEGAN I BECAME DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THIS QUESTION OF HOW WE NEED A PERFORMING ARTS COMMUNITY WOULD COME BACK FROM COVE IT. HOW WOULD WE KEEP ARTISTS AND PATRONS SAFE HOW WOULD WE CONVINCE THEM THAT WE COULD DO SO HOW COULD WE MAKE EVERYONE FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE WERE DOING SO. I DECIDED THAT TEMPLATE SHOULD REACH OUT TO OUR THEATRICAL LABOR UNION PARTNERS TO FORMULATE A PLAN. THEY EACH HAD RETAIN NOTABLE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND I THOUGHT. IF I COULD CONVINCE REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH LABOR UNION TO JOIN ME IN A ROOM TOGETHER WE COULD ASSEMBLE COMPREHENSIVE GUIDELINES ADDRESSING THE SAFETY NEEDS AND COCERNS OF ALL THE ARTISTS WHO COLLABORATE IN THE CREATION OF LIVE PERFORMANCE. AND WHOSE WORK PUTS THEM ESPECIALLY AT RISK IT TOOK A LITTLE PERSUASION BUT FINALLY OUR JOINT LABOR MANAGEMENT CODE SAFETY TASK FORCE WAS ASSEMBLED. AND AS FAR AS I KNOW OUR TASK FORCE IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY FOR OUR INDUSTRY WHERE REPRESENTATIVES OF EACH UNION HAVE SAT DOWN WITH EACH OTHER. AND WITH PRODUCERS TO WORK ON A COMPREHENSIVE SET OF SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS COMPANIES ARE SMALL I BELIEVE WE ARE UNIQUELY WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THE KOBE CRISIS. I DON'T THINK MANY AT THIS TIME WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE ATTENDING A POP CONCERT OR A HUGE TOURING PRODUCTIONS. BUT WHAT IF PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GO TO A BOTANICAL GARDEN OR ZOO OR MISSED MUSEUM SCULPTURE GARDEN THAT WAS ALREADY. ALREADY PROVED TO BE OPEN AND WHAT IF WHEN THEY GOT THERE THERE WAS A STRING QUARTET PLAYING OR A SERIES OF DANCE SOLOIST PERFORMING OR MAYBE A MAGICIAN DAZZLING EVERYONE WITH SLEIGHT OF HAND. SMALL SMALL PERFORMANCES FOR SMALL NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WAS THE WAY TO START I THOUGHT. THIS WOULD BE A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN HOW TO GATHER SAFELY ALL SPREAD OUT WEARING MASKS OUTSIDE AND THIS WOULD BE A WAY FOR PRODUCERS AND ARTISTS TO LEARN TOGETHER HOW TO PRODUCE AND PERFORM SAFELY IN A PANDEMIC. THE BIG PRODUCTION HOUSES MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED RIGHT AWAY BUT THE VAST NETWORK OF SMALL ORDS ORGANIZATIONS ARTS ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WOULDN'T HESITATE. AND WOULDN'T THAT START DISTILLER CAN. AND IT. WITH DOCTOR FOREVER G. ARE RESTORE OF THE LA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I MENTIONED THAT I WAS WORKING WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE THEATRICAL LABOR UNIONS TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR INCREMENTAL RETURNED TO LIVE PERFORMANCE. THEY WERE INTRIGUED THEY HAD JUST RECENTLY RECEIVED THE WHITE PAPER FROM THE FILM TELEVISION AND MUSIC INDUSTRIES. THAT WAS ALSO A JOINT EFFORT OF MANAGEMENT LABOR BY THE WAY AND IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL NOT ONLY IN PROVIDING A ROAD MAP TO RE OPEN THE SECTOR. BUT ALSO IN KEEPING LARGE NUMBERS OF WORKING ARTISTS HEALTHY. THE ONLY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ENCOURAGED US TO PUT SOMETHING SIMILAR TOGETHER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS. AND OUR DEBT TASK FORCE DECIDED TO TAKE THIS CHALLENGE ON. THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL BE SHARING WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF OUR PRINCIPLES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCREMENTAL RETURNED TO LIVE PERFORMANCE. WE HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFETY PROTOCOLS TO SUPPORT LIVE PERFORMANCE EVERY TIER LEVEL STARTING WITH WORK OUTDOORS AT DRIVE INS AND IMPARTNER VENUES. THEN ADDING MORE INDOORS- TO FILLMORE STREET LIVE PERFORMANCES WITH NO AUDIENCE PRESENT UNTIL WE ULTIMATELY ARRIVE AT WORK IN LARGER AND MORE TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE SPACES BOTH INDOORS AND OUTDOORS. ALWAYS MAINTAINING ROBUST PHYSICAL DISTANCING BOTH ONSTAGE AND IN THE HOUSE. THOUGHTFULLY LIMITING TOTAL OCCUPANCY REQUIRING FREQUENT PCR TESTING FOR OUR PERFORMERS AND PRODUCTION STAFF. ENCOURAGING MASK WEARING. SANITATION DISK DISINFECTION PAYING SPECIAL ATTENTION TO VENTILATION AND ALL INDOOR SPACES. AND INSISTING THAT PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY BE TAKEN FOR HYGIENE AN OFFSITE BEHAVIOR BY EVERYONE ON THE PRODUCTION TEAM. OUR ENTIRE SET OF RECOMMENDATION RUNS TO ABOUT SEVENTY PAGES BUT THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY. PROVIDES A MUCH SHORTER AND REASONABLY COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW AND I REALLY HOPE YOU WILL READ IT. PERFORMING ARTS PRODUCERS KNOW HOW TO MANAGE AUDIENCES. AND WE AND WE IN THE THEATER HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF DEALING WITH COMPLICATED SAFETY PROTOCOLS. RETURNING ARTISTS AND PATRONS TO LIVE PERFORMANCE. IN A MANNER THAT FEELS REAL SURE WE SAFE AND BRINGS EVERY JOY AND- RESULT. WE CAN THAT. WE NEED YOUR HELP NOW IN ENCOURAGING THIS ADMINISTRATION TO ISSUE MORE DETAILED GUIDELINES FOR SAFE THE OPENING OF THE PERFORMING ARTS. IDEALLY THE AYE ADMINISTRATION WILL LIKE TO WORK WITH OUR JOINT LABOR LABOR MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE WE'VE INVESTED MONTHS OF TIME IN COLLECTIVE EFFORT INTO DELAYED THIRTY SEVEN WE BELIEVE. IS NEEDED AND IN ADDITION I ENCOURAGE THIS COUNCIL TO LOOK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUR SMALL AND MID SIZED ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE ANY RETURNED TO LIVE PERFORMANCE SAFELY IS GOING TO BRING SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL COST THEIR ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT ABSORB ESPECIALLY WITH THE COST OF COMPLIANCE WITH EIGHTY FIVE AND THE IMPACT OF BEING. CLOSE FOR GOING ON ELEVEN MONTHS WE NEED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RELIEF OTHERWISE I'M AFRAID THAT MANY OF OUR VIBRANT SMALL ORGANIZATIONS ARE AT RISK OF NEVER COMING BACK AND THAT WILL DEAL WITH TERRIBLE BLOW TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND TO ALL OF OUR IMPORTANT TO OUR OUR OUR ALL IMPORTANT ENTERTAINMENT. THAT WE MAY NEVER RECOVER FROM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU JOANNE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT ROADMAP TO OPENING. SMALL SMALL SMALL I LIKE THAT I THINK AGAIN. OPENING THE SMALL. OPENING QUICKLY WITH ALL THE PROTOCOLS YOU SUGGEST AND I AM HOPING THAT OTHERS ON OUR CALL. I WILL. STILL EACH OTHER'S INFORMATION AS IF YOU SPENT THE TIME WORKING ON IT- WE DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT BECAUSE YOU DID A VERY COMPREHENSIVE. ROAD MAP RIGHT HERE THAT I JUST HEARD THANK YOU WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY MARTHA I WAS CALLING YOU JOANNE. SORRY MARTHA. I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU FOR THAT EXCELLENT PRESENTATION NEXT WE HAVE JOHN FORSYTE REVIVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET MORE THAN A FEW TIMES- AS HE WORKS TIRELESSLY AND FULLER TEND NOT FULLER CHEN SORRY ORANGE COUNTY- BUT HE IS THE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY OF ORANGE COUNTY. WELCOME JOHN. THANK YOU SO MUCH- WE WERE FOUNDED IN FULLERTON SO I TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR OFFERING THIS HEARING TODAY AND CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL SPEAKERS WHO SPOKE BEAUTIFULLY COMPELLINGLY AND I'LL TRY TO BUILD ANTONIANS COMMENTS SHE DID A TERRIFIC JOB- SO. SPECIFICALLY I YOU KNOW I RUN AN ORCHESTRA THAT'S- ABOUT- FORTY YEARS OLD AND I'VE BEEN WITH IT TWENTY TWO YEARS AND ARE MUSIC DIRECTORS BEEN WITH ORCHESTRA THIRTY ONE YEARS AND HE IS A DISTINGUISHED AMERICAN LEADER HAS OFTEN SAID USYK IS A BIRTHRIGHT THAT MUST BE SHARED EQUALLY BY ALL. OF HIS PHILOSOPHY IS EMBEDDED IN OUR DNA. AND YOU'D BE SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT 40% OF ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WHOHEAR THE PACIFIC SYMPHONY DO SO FOR FREE- JUST BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE RECEIVED A BEAUTIFUL TOUCHING LETTER FROM- COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATES DESCRIBING THE REACTION OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO ATTENDED THE CONCERT. THE LETTER SAID MY CLASSIC IT WAS JUST IN COMPLETE AND UTTER AWE. SHE KEPT SAYING ALL NIGHT LONG HOW MUCH FUN SHE WAS HAVING OUR YOUNG GUYS COULD NOT ABSORB ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW IF SHE EVEN BLANKS. DURING THE PANDEMIC I'M PROUD TO REPORT THAT WE CONTINUE TO PAY OUR MUSICIANS AND THEIR FLEXIBILITY PROVIDING DIGITAL SERVICES TO ALL OUR PARTNERS AND AUDIENCES. IT IS HOWEVER EXCEPTIONALLY DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN ITSELF FOR. ON BEHALF OF THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ORCHESTRAS AND THOUSANDS OF MUSICIANS STAFF AND BOARD MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SYMPHONY- CALIFORNIA SYMPHONY NETWORK I URGE YOU TO ESTABLISH GUIDELINES FOR THE SAFE RETURN OF THE PUBLIC TO OUR PERFORMANCE. WE ARE BEHIND OTHER STATES IN CREATING CLEAR RELEVANT GUIDELINES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. TO THOSE- SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE IMPACT TO THOSE IN. THAT WE CARE ABOUT LIKE OUR MUSICIANS AUDIENCES STUDENTS AND TEACHERS JOHN CAN I AND MAYBE CERTAIN JOHN CAN I. CAN YOU JUST TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT YOU TOLD ME THREE FOUR WHICH IS. BY TOMORROW OR IN A MONTH OF WHAT YOU NEED BY GUIDELINES SO THAT YOU CAN BE PREPARED TO AT LEAST OFFER A FOR A FULL. SEASON IF YOU WANT TO SAY IT THAT WAY WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN NOW SURE. WELL LET ME JUST COMMENT ON THE GERMAN STUDY THAT CAME OUT WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR YOU ALL TO UNDERSTAND GERMAN SCIENTISTS DEMONSTRATED THAT CONCERT HALLS CAN OPERATE AT RISK OF INFECTION. FROM COBA NINETEEN THE STUDY SHOWS THAT A CHECKERBOARD PATTERN OF SEATING IN THE AUDITORIUM IT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO ENSURE AUDIENCE SAFETY. THIS AND OTHER STUDIES SHOW THAT WE CAN SAFELY REOPEN AUDIENCES NOW. SO WHILE WE READ THE MOVIE THEATERS ARE BEING ALLOWED TO OPEN CERTAIN TEARS A CONCERT HALL SHOULD NOT BE BOUND BY THE SAME REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. AS A MOVIE THEATER GIVEN THE CUBIC VOLUME OF AIR AND SOPHISTICATION OF ERROR HANNAH MOTHER AMONG OTHER ATTRIBUTES. WITH AN ELITE SCIENTIFIC TEAM IN GERMANY MAKING THIS REPORT. WE HAVE TO REPLICATE THE SAME STUDY IN OUR CONCERT HALLS AND WE MOVE FORWARD. SO HARPER ROAD MAP IS BASED ON A TIERED STRUCTURE WE EMPLOY IN CALIFORNIA. FOR THE PURPLE TEAR WE RECOMMEND OUTDOOR PERFORMANCES ALIGNED WITH THOSE FOR LEGISLATORS SOME PERFORMANCES. OF PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES WOULD BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PATRONS IN ATTENDANCE. ENSEMBLES WOULD MAINTAIN SOCIAL DISTANCE DOES DISTANCING BUT FORECASTERS COULD PERFORM IN THE LARGE STAGE ACCOMMODATES AGREED UPON RECORDING INDUSTRY FOR LABOR MANAGEMENT SAFETY AGREEMENTS. INDOORS NO MORE THAN FIFTY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND. THE RED TIER OUTDOOR PERFORMANCES WOULD INCREASE TO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED PERMITTED INDOORS. HOWEVER IT IS IN THE ORANGE TEAR THAT WE PROPOSE UTILIZING THE CHECKER BOARD SEATING PLAN FOR INDOOR AND OUTDOOR VENUES. AND IT IS WHAT THE YELLOW TIER AND THIS IS WHERE I THINK WE REALLY NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE WE WOULD ASK YOU TO CONSIDER ALLOWING FULL RE OPENING. OF OUR OUTDOOR CONCERT HALL AND INDOOR CONCERT VENUES. WITH MASKING SPACING FOR PUBLIC AREAS CLEANING AND OTHER CDC SAFETY PROTOCOL. PLEASE BEAR IN MIND IS DE TO MAKE IMMEDIATE CHANGES GIVEN THE LONG LEAD TIMES WE REQUIRE SO PROVIDE SOME BUFFER TIME TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SERVE TRACKS. GIVEN THE VARIABILITY OF PHYSICAL SIZE OF PERFORMANCE AND SEATING AREAS BOTH OUTDOORS AND INDOORS. THE SOPHISTICATION OF AIR HANDLING AND OTHER VARIABLES WE WOULD ASK THAT OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS IMPACT OUR TO REVIEW A SAFETY PLAN WITH A LOT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS NOTICE. THAT MIGHT ALLOW FOR ORGANIZATION TO EXCEED CAPACITY THRESHOLD PARTICULARLY IN THE EARLY STAGES. WE ALSO ASK FOR CLEAR GUIDANCE ON THE POINT AT WHICH FULL SEATING CAPACITY WITH MASKS FOR WITHOUT. IS PERMISSIBLE RECOGNIZED THINGS ARE VERY ONG PLANNING LEAD TIMES. AT THREE FINAL POINTS I WOULD VISIT THE- DURING THE PANDEMIC PURPOSES OF SUCCESSFULLY MAKING THE CASE FOR PHILANTHROPIC SUPPORT THE CRIPPLING LOSS OF TICKET SALES I'M NOT BEING ABLE TO HOLD IN PERSON PERFORMANCES MEAN WE NEED A FINANCIAL INFORMATION FROM THE STATE. TO GET BACK ON OUR FEET PARTICULARLY AFTER A FEDERAL PROGRAMS WAIT. IT WILL TAKE TIME TO REGAIN AUDIENCES AND RESTORE REVENUE. AND SECOND AS EARLIER STATED OUR MUSICIANS ARE TEACHING ARTISTS WORKING AS TEACHING ARTISTS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE. A CATEGORIZATION ALONGSIDE TEACHERS AND WAS SEEN IN THE BACKSEAT. AND LASTLY. I WOULD JUST SAY- IN RELATION TO THE ARTS COUNCIL FUNDING I WANT TO RE EMPHASIZE WE ARE ONE TEN THE FUNDING LEVEL OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA. IT IS TIME TO REALLY MAKE CALIFORNIA LEADER NOT A LAGGARD WE NEED TO GET AHEAD AND WE NEED. TO BE THE STATE LEADS THE WAY IN THE RE OPENING OF THE ARTS AND CULTURE. OKAY THERE IS A QUOTE THAT WE CAN USE WE WANT TO BE A LEADER NOT A LAGGARD AT IN NOT ONLY ARE ARTS FUNDING BUT AND IT'S STARTING TO OPEN UP THE- VENUES AS WE KNOW WE ARE A LANGER RIGHT NOW- THAT BEING SAID- GUIDELINES AGAIN IN ORDER TO GET SOME OF THIS RE OPENING SO- I APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU DO. JOHN AND- WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE THE BROKEN RECORD TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR THEM. JOINING US. MEDICARE THIS IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER KAMLAGER CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES SO I AM I'M ALSO GOING TO HAVE TO STEP OUT FOR THIS- CAUCUS BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING THAT I'D BEEN AND TALKING ABOUT GUIDELINES THAT I'VE BEEN TAKING NOTES ON AND WHAT I'VE ALSO HEARD IS YOU KNOW I MADE YOU STRONGER DISCUSSION WITH EDT ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE- SPECIALIZED CARE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE CREATIVE ECONOMY WE KNOW THAT THEY HAVE VERY CHALLENGING TIMES IS GETTING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OUT REGULARLY BUT EVEN IN THE PAST THEY HAVE STRUGGLED WITH MAKING SURE THAT ARTISTS. WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR CLAIMS BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSIDERED SEASONAL WORKERS SO I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT TO WHAT WE'RE PUTTING IN THE RECORD DIGITAL BROADBAND CAME UP. FROM OUR SISTER IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF SMALL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ARE CHALLENGED WITH THAT ACCESO AS WORTH FIGHTING FOR DIGITAL BROADBAND ACCESS FOR ALL WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WERE INCORPORATING THE ARTS INTO THAT. IN JUST BE TRUE ARTS RECOVERY INFUSION OF DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RED LEAD FOR MORE TALKING ABOUT CHILD CARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HEALTHCARE- YOU KNOW MANY OF OUR ARTISTS ARE WORKING TO THREE FOR JOBS- AND SO HOW DO WE SORT OF FORMALIZED SOMETHING THAT'S TARGETED. YOU KNOW IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I'VE HEARD AND THE YOU KNOW LASTLY THERE WAS ALSO A STUDY THAT CAME OUT. THAT SAID EVEN 20% CAPACITY. WOULD WORK- FOR MANY- ARTS INSTITUTIONS AND EVEN OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES SO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M PUTTING THAT IN THE RECORD OF WAYS THAT WE CAN WORK AGGRESSIVELY TO SUPPORT OUR ARTS COMMUNITY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOMEOWNER AND I AGREED THOSE. NOTES WILL BE ADDED AND ALL EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND AGAIN THIS IS WHY WE DO THESE. INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WE HEAR SOME INFORMATION REGULARLY BUT THEN THERE'S NEW INFORMATION AND THAT THE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN SAID BY OUR PANELISTS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE TOP. OF OUR LIST SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND THANK YOU WE ARE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE NOW TO DAN BECKERMAN PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF AB E. G. WORLDWIDE. WELCOME DAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ON BEHALF OF NOT ONLY A U. G. ABOUT ON THE SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR US IN ALL THE AREAS BEING DISCUSSED TODAY. WE SEE THEM AS PART OF THE SAME ECOSYSTEM THE ARTS MUSIC ENTERTAINMENT AND TOURISM- TO PROVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT E. G. WORLDWIDE SPORTS AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY WERE HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES. AND WHILE WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF PROPERTIES ALL OVER THE WORLD- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE OWN AND OPERATE TWO STADIUMS SIX SPORTS TEAMS INCLUDING THE LA KINGS SEVEN CONVENTION CENTERS INCLUDING- MOSCONI AND THE LA CONVENTION CENTER. EIGHT ARENAS INCLUDING STAPLES CENTER TEN MUSIC FESTIVALS INCLUDING THE COACHELLA FESTIVAL AND FIFTEEN CLUBS AND THEATRES UP AND DOWN THE COAST SO WE'RE OF A MAJOR STAKEHOLDER IN CALIFORNIA. YOU'VE HEARD SEVERAL TIMES TODAY ALREADY LIVE ENTERTAINMENT WAS THE FIRST INDUSTRY TO BE SHUT DOWN AND WILL BE THE LAST TO RETURN AND OVER THE COURSE OF OUR SHUT DOWN IT WILL WILL LOSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN INCOME SALES BUSINESS AND OTHER TAXES FOR THE CITY THE COUNTY AND STATE- IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE ONE THAT WEIGHS HEAVY ON US IS THE IMPACT THAT THIS HAS HAD. ON OUR EMPLOYEES WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF FULL TIME EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED WITH FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS. AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PART TIME EVENT EMPLOYEES WHO SHE IS. THE SHIPS HAVE JUST DISAPPEARED AS THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN CANCELED. THESE ARE OUR SECURITY OFFICERS ARE USHERS ARE CUSTODIAL STAFF OR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. AND MANY OF THEM RELY ON THOSE SHIPS AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF INCOME. OTHERS JUST NEED THOSE SHIFTS TO MAKE ENDS MEET- BUT EITHER WAY THESE ARE LONG STANDING IT IMPLODING IS- I WANNA MAKE A POINT I THINK I'M THE ONLY ONE SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SPORTS BUSINESS SO I LIKE TO JUST. HIGHLIGHT ONE POINT ON SPORTS TOURISM- AND THE SPORTS RELATED TRAVEL INDUSTRY IT'S A MASSIVE. INDUSTRY FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUAL SPENDING. THREE QUARTERS OF A MILLION JOBS FIFTEEN BILLION IN TAX REVENUE NATIONALLY. AND THIS SECTOR HAS JUST BEEN DEVASTATED- AS EVENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE CANCELED OR RELOCATED- WERE CONDUCTED WITHOUT FANS- YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM OUR OUR FRIENDS AND OUR PARTNERS AT LIVE NATION- IN A SECOND AND I WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT. IT'S NOT JUST LARGE COMPANIES LIKE LIVE NATION AND AEG THAT ARE HAVING- OUR REVENUES AND OUR EMPLOYEES IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THERE ARE COUNTLESS SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS CRISIS AS WELL IT COULD BE THE FAMILY OWNED RESTAURANT ACROSS THE STREET FROM STAPLES CENTER THAT NEEDS ARE PUT TRAFFIC. OR ONE OF THE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE VENDORS OR SUPPLIERS TO OUR RESTAURANTS ARE FESTIVALS IN OUR BAND. IT COULD BE THE WOMAN KNOWN CUSTOM SIGNAGE COMPANY OR THE MINORITY OWN PARTY TO COURT COMPANY THAT WE WORK WITH L. A. LOT. BUT THIS CRISIS HAS REALLY TAKEN ITS TOLL ON FAMILY MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES THAT RELY ON SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT AND TOURISM. I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT GUIDELINES I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A QUICK SECOND- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND IS TASK FORCE OVER THE LAST TEN MONTHS- AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS AND WE'VE DEVELOPED THE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR. HOW WE CAN SAFELY LIVE WITH THAT CODE NINETEEN BUYERS AND OPERATE PARTS OF OUR BUSINESS IS IN A LIMITED WAY. WE HAVE FAMILIES GUIDELINES WE HAVE PARTIAL CAPACITY GUIDELINES AND WE PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES OUR ATHLETES ARE ARTISTS AND. ART FANS AS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO THAT AND WE CREATED A SAFETY. WE POSTED FAMILIES. OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH THE LAST SPEAKER- PUT IT VERY VERY WELL IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO RESTORE INDUSTRY. AND BRING BACK OUR EMPLOYEES- ALL WRAPPED UP HERE IN A SECOND BUT AYE AYE. I WANNA IT SHOWS SOME OPTIMISM BECAUSE THANKFULLY CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CHANGING. SEX SCENES ARE GOING INTO ARMS FOR A MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. WE'RE SEEING THE CASE COUNTS FINALLY COME DOWN IN THE PATH RATES DECLINING WHICH IS ENCOURAGING. NOW WE HAVE THIS UNIQUE LINES THAT WE OPERATE VENUES ALL OVER THE WORLD SO WE CAN SEE. THAT WITH PROPER SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MANDATORY MASK WEARING AND REGULAR TESTING OF OUR STAFF. WE CAN SAFELY HOST EVENTS ITH PARTIAL CAPACITY. AND WE SEE IT IN CHINA WE SEE IT IN OUR VENUES IN AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND. AND WE CAN SEE A PATH TO RETURNING OUR BUSINESS- AND THE TRANSITION TO STARTED HERE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL. BUT AS AN INDUSTRY OUR PRIMARY FOCUS NEEDS TO BE EVOLVING THE GUIDELINES WE HAVE TODAY. TO REFLECT THE FACT THAT VACCINATIONS ARE GOING INTO ARMS. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. TO TAKE THOSE GUIDELINES ENHANCE THEM AND ADAPT THEM FROM WHAT WE HAVE TODAY. WHICH IS REALLY FOCUSED ON HOW WE LIVE WITH THE VIRUS. TO A SYSTEM THAT WILL HELP US EMERGE FROM THE PANDEMIC AND BEGIN TO LIVE WITHOUT. THANK YOU VERY MCH. THANK YOU AND- I THINK THIS REALLY DOES HELP ME PUT INTO PERSPECTIVE- FROM VERY LARGE ENTERTAINMENT ORGANIZATION LIKE YOURS BUT TO THE SMALLER ONES OF HOW WE CAN TAKE THE SCENARIO WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW AS YOU MENTIONED WITH. VACCINES AS ACCOUNTS GOING DOWN AND EVEN DEATH ON START TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT IS OUR NEXT SIX MONTH PLAN. WE WILL THAT NOW MOVED TO JAIL BURKE I TOLD THE WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF LIVE NATION. WELCOME JAIL. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THIS YEAR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS JOE BURKE TOLD I'M THE PRESIDENT OF LIVE NATION ENTERTAINMENT- WHERE THEY WANT TO BE GLOBAL LEADERS IN LIVE ENTERTAINMENT WE OPERATE IN. FORTY COUNTRIES WITH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND pMORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND AROUND THE WORLD. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE PROMOTED FORTY THOUSAND CONCERTS AND HUNDRED FESTIVALS FOR A HUNDRED MILLION FANS GLOBALLY. WE ARE BASED HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OUR HEADQUARTERS IN LOS ANGELES. WE EMPLOY OVER SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA DURING THE SUMMER CONCERT SEASON. AB THOUSAND NINETEEN WE APPROXIMATE FOUR THOUSAND SHOWS AND SEVEN MILLION FANS. ATTEND AT OVER THIRTY VENUES IN THE STATE- THIS IS FANTA SPOKE TO MANY OF THE REOPENING PLANS LAST FAR HAVE BEEN. FOCUSED AROUND SOCIAL DISTANCE TEAM LIMITED CAPACITY AND OTHER NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS OF MINE. BEFORE THE VACCINES WERE AVAILABLE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS A MAP THERE ARE SEVERELY CONSTRAINED- ONE NATION OVER THE PAST YEARS LOST MORE THAN BROADLY 77% ALIVE INDUSTRY WORKERS OF LOS THE 100% OF THEIR INCOME. ALLISON'S OF WORKERS THAT AREN'T ANY IMPACTED BY THE FURLOUGHS AND LAYOFFS HAVE HAD TREMENDOUS DAMAGE AS MANY OF THE SPEAKERS AND SPOKEN TO. RESERVISTS OFFICE STATUS LOST MILLIONS IN TAX REVENUE AND MUCH MORE AN OVERALL ECONOMIC IMPACT. BUT NOW IS WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL WITH AXIOM ROLLOUT. WE DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO TURN THE FOCUS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENS. WHEN THE VACCINE IS READILY AVAILABLE. THE GOOD NEWS CAN WITH TRACK ON ON BACKS. ACTUALLY CURRENTLY INDICATE SHOULD BE A ACT MAXINE FOR EVERYBODY IN THE COUNTRY BY. AND AT THAT POINT WHAT ARE OUR PLANS NOW FIRST WE UNDERSTAND THE PRIORITY NEEDS TO BE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ALL AVAILABLE SUPPLY TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY POSSIBLES VACCINATED. IN THIS PART IN STAFFORD MY NATION'S DRAWING WITH AG LEAVE- I OUT SEE ANOTHER'S REPRESENTED IN THIS HEARING OFFER OUR FACILITIES AND RESOURCES TO THE VACCINATION EFFORT. WE'VE POSTED VENUES IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS AROUND HAPPINESS MAXINE SITES AND WE'RE PREPARED TO HELP ANY EFFORTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN'T. THEN AS WE CONTINUE TO GET FURTHER CLARITY ON VACCINES TIMING IT'S IMPORTANT TO ESTABLISH NOW THE GUIDELINES FOR RE OPENING WHEN THOSE VACCINES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL. WE NEED THOSE FACTS THE THOSE GUIDELINES NOW BECAUSE THE LEAD TIME PROMOTERS ARE STILL PLANNED ITS WORST SELL THE TICKETS REHEARSED THE SHALL REMAIN PERFORMED. EVERYONE NEEDS OF THE COMPLIMENTS OF SHOWS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAPPEN IF THE GUIDELINES ARE MET IN ORDER TO GET STARTED. AS PART OF THIS WE NEED CLARITY ON HOW THESE. GUIDELINES WILL VARY FOR OUTDOOR VENUES. WHICH HAVE DEMONSTRATED MUCH GREATER LOWER RISK OF TRANSMISSION. IT REMAINS DAR AMBITION TO RETURN MONNING CONCERTS AT SCALE THIS SUMMER BUT ACCOMPLISHING THIS REQUIRES GUIDELINES THAT WE THE ARTISTS AND FANS ALIKE CAN DEPEND ON. WE STAND READY TO DO OUR PART OF THE RE OPENING PROVIDING ENHANCED CLEANING SANITATION CONTACT WITH CENTURY- CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS. STAGGER CROWD FLOW IN A RANGE OF OTHER OPERATIONAL PRECAUTIONS AS WE'D BE IN THE WELL BEING OF FANS ARTISTS AND STAFF WILL ALWAYS BE OUR TOP PRIORITY. WE ALSO NOT OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT TOGETHER WORKING FOR USING OTHERS AND DEVASTATING AND WITH THE VACCINE PROCESS UNDER WAY IT'S CRITICAL TO NOW TURN OUR ATTENTION.

THAT HAS IMPACTED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WITH THIS IS A SERIOUS SERIOUS DISCUSSION. AND THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT OF RE OPENING SAFELY BUT MANY OF THESE INSTITUTIONS THAT IS THEIR JOB TO MOVE PEOPLE MOVE THEM SAFELY THREE THROUGH AND THE LAST THING THEY WANT IS SOME TYPE OF SUPER SPREADER EVENT. WITH THAT THE- I KNOW WE HAVE ASSEMBLYMEMBER NAZARIAN THAT LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT UNFORTUNATELY SINCE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE OFF IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES JUST WANTED TO RE EMPHASIZE SOMETHING I'M GLAD THAT EVERYONE.

IT'S THE UNCERTAINTY OF NOT KNOWING AND AGAIN WE'RE ALL. WORKING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND MANY IT NONE OF US HAVE BEEN THROUGH A PANDEMIC SO THIS IS NOT TO PUT A BLAME GAME.

THE DIRECTOR OF FESTIVAL VENUE OPERATIONS ANOTHER PLANET ENTERTAINMENT. WELCOME RUTH- THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CASEY LOUDERMILK WHO'S THE NEXT PERSON IS GOING TO GO IN ME IN THIS. HELLO AND CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WELL MMHM AND YES HE MENTIONED CASEY A LOAN LOAN AMOUNT WITH ASSISTANT MANAGER AT BILL GRAHAM CIVIC. AUDITORIUM WILL BE- PART OF THE PRESENTATION AS WELL. HI YEP THANK YOU TO HELLO TO SOAK INTO SHARE THIS SLIDESHOW. THERE WE GO YEAH. ALL RIGHT AND I ARE HERE FROM ANOTHER PLANET ENTERTAINMENT WE ARE THE LARGEST INDEPENDENT CONCERT PROMOTER IN CALIFORNIA WE PERCENT OVER SEVEN HUNDRED SHOWS A YEAR HOSTING OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LIVE MUSIC. ARBENZ RANGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO PASS A BIG BLOW TO A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PERSON THREE DAY MUSIC FESTIVAL IN GOLDEN GATE PARK. INDEPENDENT VENUES AND CONCERT PROMOTERS ARE ANCHOR BUSINESSES IN YOUR COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO A RECENT ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY. FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR SPENT ON A CONCERT TICKET WELL DOLLARS TO GENERATE IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY AND BARS RESTAURANTS LODGING AND TRANSPORTATION. WHICH MEANS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT INDEPENDENT VENUES IN CALIFORNIA IS ESTIMATED AT OVER THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.SINCE THE SHUTDOWN WE'VE ALL BECOME NEW FOUND INDUSTRY ADVOCATES EMERGING FROM BEHIND THE CURTAINS AND ENGAGING WITH THE NATIONAL INDEPENDENT VENUE ASSOCIATION OR DEVELOP. A GROUP OF TENACIOUSLY INDEPENDENT VENUE OWNERS FESTIVALS AND PROMOTERS BORN IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY IN RESPONSE TO COVER NINETEEN EVEN HAS OVER THREE THOUSAND MEMBERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOUR FOURTH REGIONAL COALITIONS FROM SAN DIEGO ORANGE COUNTY LOS ANGELES AREA SACRAMENTO. A FULL YEAR OF ANOTHER PLANET CONCERTS HAVE BEEN CANCELED INCLUDING OUR MAJOR MUSIC FESTIVAL OUTSIDE LANDS TWENTY TWENTY. IF WE CAN'T PRODUCE OUTSIDE LANDS TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT WILL BE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN LOST REVENUE TO THE BAY AREA ECONOMY. AND THE EQUIVALENT OF OVER TWO THOUSAND FULL TIME JOBS LOST IN ADDITION TO IT BEING A MAJOR REVENUE LOSS TO THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S GENERAL FUND. WE'RE THE FIRST TO CLOSE LAST REOPENING NO REVENUE AND ALL THE OVERHEAD COSTS. TO DATE OVER THREE HUNDRED INDEPENDENT VENUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE PERMANENTLY CLOSED. IN ADDITION OR FURTHER TEACH THE PANDEMIC THIS INCLUDES NOT ONLY UNION THEATRICAL LABOR BUT ALSO BARTENDERS SECURITY CATERING JANITORIAL SOUND AND LIGHTING COMPANIES TRUCK DRIVERS AND MANY MORE. AS NEVA WE SUCCESSFULLY ADVOCATED FOR THE SAVE OUR STATE EXACT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE RECENTLY PASSCODE RELIEF PACKAGE HOWEVER WE HAVE YET TO SEE AN APPLICATION FOR THIS GRANT PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM WILL BE A MUCH NEEDED LIFELINE BUT AS THIS HEARING MAKES APPARENT WE HAVE YET TO SEE OUR FINISH LINE. IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE WILL NEED TO BE A PATCHWORK OF RELIEF AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE WON'T BE A MASS CULTURAL EXTINCTION IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE SEEN SMALLER MARKETS INVESTING THE SURVIVAL OF THEIR CREATIVE ECONOMY DURING THIS SHUTDOWN. FOR EXAMPLE ORGAN HAS INVESTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS MARYLAND AT THIRTY MILLION AND MANY MORE. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT RE OPENING CONCERTS AND FESTIVALS IS THAT YOU HAVE AG INDUSTRY A PUBLIC ASSEMBLY SAFETY EXPERTS WHO CAN'T SIDELINE BUT NOTHING ELSE TO DO RESEARCH AND PREPARE FOR SAFE REOPENING. OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS AS AN INDUSTRY WE HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO RESPOND AND ADAPT TO A GROWING NUMBER OF THREATS ACTIVE SHOOTERS AND THREATS OF TERRORISM. PROMPTED THE QUICK ADOPTION OF MAGNETOMETERS CLEAR BAG POLICIES MULTI AGENCY ONSITE COMMAND CENTERS AND HOSTILE VEHICLE MITIGATION. THESE TRAINERS REPRESENTED 25% INCREASE OUR EXPENSES BUT AREN'T SURE TO FIRST AND FOREMOST TO CREATE SAFE ENVIRONMENTS. MASK GATHERINGS INCLEMENT WEATHER OR SAFETY THIS IS WHAT WE AS A LOT OF MINISTRY WORK ON A PLAN FOR WE ARE THE BEST PREPARED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES. OF CREATING A COVERT SAFE OF THAT. YEAH OF THIS INCOME. DON'T WORK IF THEY'RE NOT FAULT SCALE. REMOVE VENUES ARTISTS THE SENATE. HAVE THE SAME EXPENSES WHETHER THE ROOM IS A 20% OR A 100% SOLD REAL BRING GUIDELINES ONLY FOR SOCIAL A DEFINITE WILL NOT BRING US BACK. BUSTLES IN CONCERT THE A SUBSTANTIAL ONE WAY TO GET OVER TO PRODUCE A CONCERT WE NEED MONTHS OF THE TIME AND FOR ARTISTS MARKETS SHOWS SELL TICKETS AND HIGHER MEMBERS AND STAFF. WE ARE ASKING THE STATE TO GIVE US A SEAT AT THE TABLE TO HELP DEVELOP PLANS TO REOPEN SAFELY AT FULL CAPACITY WHEN WE RE OPEN WE WILL AGAIN BE A MAJOR ECONOMIC DRIVER IF WE CAN'T REOPEN WE NEED YOUR HELP TO STAY ALIVE. IN THE PAST WE HAVE SHOULDERED THE ESCALATING COSTS TO KEEP OUR CONCERT SAFE NEVER COMPROMISING OUR EFFORTS AND NEVER REACHING OUT FOR HELP. BUT THIS IS A SITUATION WE CAN'T SEE OUR WAY THROUGH ALONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH YOU TO DEVELOP TARGETED FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR SHATTERED INDEPENDENT VENUES AND PROMOTERS. CONCERTS BRING DIVERSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER. THIS TYPE OF UNITY IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO NEEDED RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AND AS YOU CAN SEE WE KIND OF HAVE THREE PRESENTERS RELATED TO- MAJOR CONCERTS AND ENTERTAINMENT I CAN TELL YOU PERSONALLY THAT. I TO MISS CONCERTS AND I KNOW MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS JUST CANNOT WAIT. WE ALSO TAKE SERIOUS- THE VACCINATIONS THAT- ARE HAPPENING. AND NEED TO LEAVE THIS HEARING BY IS SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE- THAT. WE CAN REOPEN SAFELY AND THAT MANY OF YOU THAT ARE ON THIS CALL ARE IN THE BUSINESS TO DO EXACTLY THAT. OUR LAST TWO PRESENTERS ARE RELATED TO OUR MUSEUMS ARE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS IN LOS ANGELES. COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART SO WE WILL WELCOME CELESTE DAY WALDRON WHO IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATIONS OF MUSEUMS. WELCOME FOR LESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR INVITING ME TO PRESENT THIS MORNING ON THE IMPACT OF CODE NINETEEN ON MUSEUMS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MUSEUMS DEFINITION OF MUSEUMS- IS A NONPROFIT AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. THAT MAKE UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMMUNITY BY INTERPRETING AND PRESERVING THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD THAT INCLUDES ORGANIZATIONS THAT COLLECT OBJECTS SUCH AS ART HISTORY AND NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES NON COLLECTING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE SCIENCE CENTERS AND CHILDREN'S MUSEUM. AND THOSE WOULD LIVING COLLECTIONS LIKE AQUARIUMS ZOOS AND BOTANICAL GARDEN. MANY PEOPLE VISIT MUSEUMS MORE THAN THE NUMBER WHO ATTEND PROFESSIONAL SPORTING EVENTS. AND MUSEUMS ARE ECONOMIC ENGINES AND THEIR FINANCIAL HEALTH IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR ECONOMY. BEFORE I UNDERSCORE THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF KOBE NINETEEN LET ME SHINE A LIGHT ON SOME OF THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. PRACTICALLY PRACTICALLY OVERNIGHT THE WAY MUSEUMS DELIVER THEIR EDUCATIONAL CONTENT HAS SHIFTED. IN THE MUSEUM WASN'T ALREADY DELIVERING TOURISM PROGRAMS ONLINE THEY ARE NOW JUST WHEN THE PUBLIC STUDENTS AND TEACHERS NEED AT THE MOMENT. YOU HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE WAYS MUSEUMS ARE DIRECTLY RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS AND SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES HAS COVERED NINETEEN TEST IN SIGHT DISTANCE LEARNING HUB- PANTRIES VOTING CENTERS AND NOW OFFERING TO BE VACCINATIONS BY. BY THE CREATIVITY THE REALITY IS THAT MUSEUMS ARE CLOSED AND THEN IT HAVING VERY REAL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THEIR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND IS CURBING THEIR ABILITY TO FULLY SERVE THE PUBLIC. MANY MUSEUMS HAVE RE OPENED ACROSS THE COUNTRY BASED ON A SURVEY IN MID OCTOBER 71% OF MUSEUMS ACROSS THE NATION ARE OPEN. BUT IN CALIFORNIA INDOOR MUSEUMS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO REOPEN A PURPLE TEAR COUNTY WITH NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION IN A PURPLE TEAR RIGHT NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUSEUMS ACROSS THE STATE ARE CLOSE AND HAVE BEEN FOR ALMOST A YEAR. ARE ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR PARITY IN THE STATE BLUEPRINT WHICH SHOPPING MALL. THERE IS NO PLAUSIBLE EVIDENCE BASED EXPLANATION FOR MUSEUMS TO BE CLOSE WHEN SHOPPING MALLS AND EVEN FOR PROFIT ART GALLERIES ARE OPEN. THE LOS ANGELES TIMES EDITORIAL BOARD PROMINENT MAYORS ACROSS THE STATE AND TWENTY SEVEN LEGISLATORS INCLUDING YOU MADAM CHAIR HAVE ALL EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THIS POSITION. MUSEUMS ARE SIMPLY NOT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE CAUSING AN INCREASE IN TRANSMISSION THEY ARE CAPABLE OF OPERATING SAFELY. OUR ASIAN ESTIMATES THAT CALIFORNIA MUSEUMS ARE LOSING TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A DAY DURING STATEWIDE CLOSURES. THIS IS DUE TO A LOSS OF ADMISSIONS STORE STATE HEALTH EVENT RENTALS FUNDRAISING EVENTS ANYMORE. MUSEUMS OPERATING RESERVES ARE DIMINISHING AND WON'T LAST MUCH LONGER NEARLY A THIRD OF MUSEUM DIRECTORS ARE UNSURE IF THEY'RE MUSEUM WILL SURVIVE THE PANDEMIC. WHAT CAN YOU AS OUR STATE LEADERS DO TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA MUSEUM JOIN US IN TRYING TO PERSUADE THE ADMINISTRATION TO LET MUSEUM THREE OPEN AT THE SAME CAPACITY AS SHOPPING MALLS. SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED KOBE NINETEEN RELIEF FUNDING FOR CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS BUT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. ALLOW NONPROFIT CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS OF ALL SIZES TO APPLY FOR RELIEF NINETY. PRIORITIZE ORGANIZATIONS WITH LESS ACCESS TO OTHER RELIEF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE FEDERAL SHUTTERED VENUE OPERATORS GRANT. MUSEUMS THAT DO NOT HAVE AN ATTITUDE AUDITORIUM OR THEATER WITH EXCEEDING ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THIS GRANT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU OTHER LEGISLATORS AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO CRAFT AN EFFECTIVE RELIEF PROGRAM. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. I'LL FOLLOW ON TO LAST I'M MICHAEL KEVIN DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY MUSEUM OF. ART AND I'M AND I'M SURE THANK YOU FOR THIS EVENT- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE TRAGIC IMPACT OF THIS CLOSURE ON ON US ECONOMICALLY ARTISTICALLY ON THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. LARGE LAST MONTH THE LARGEST ART MUSEUM IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES ITS BEEN CLOSED FOR TEN MONTHS. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE. AND FOLLOWING ON FROM LAST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU ENCOURAGE ART MUSEUMS ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO OPEN US NOW EVEN IN HERE. BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE THE GUIDELINES TO REOPEN IN FACT WE HELPED DEVELOP THOSE GUIDELINES FOR ART MUSEUMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN USE SINCE JUNE AND THAT'S THE LAST SAID SINCE OCTOBER AS OF OCTOBER OVER TWO MILLION PEOPLE HAVE SAFELY VISITED ART MUSEUMS- WE'RE READY TO GO WE CAN GIVE YOU THE PROTOCOLS. AND L. A. ACTUALLY IS THE WAS THE ONLY MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA TO NEVER RE OPEN. WHAT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE THAT IS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND FOR OUR COMMUNITIES FOR ARTISTS FOR JOBS- IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE CAN REOPEN IMPACT I WOULD SAY THAT YOU COULDN'T FIND A SAFER INDOOR SPACE AND ART MUSEUM IN CALIFORNIA SAFETIES BUILT IN AND IT'S BEEN ENHANCED WE HAVE MONITORED CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS THANKS TO OUR SECURITY AND VISITOR SERVICES- TEAM THEY CAN ENCOURAGE AND ENFORCE. MASK WEARING AND PHYSICAL DISTANCING WHERE NATURALLY TOUCHLESS WHO HASN'T BEEN IN FOR THE MUSEUM AND BEEN TOLD NOT TO TOUCH IN OTHER TIMES WE HAVE WIDE OPEN SPACES WIDE OPEN SPACES UNLIKE A LOT OF RETAIL WE HAVE MASSIVE AIR FILTRATION SYSTEMS WE HAVE A THOROUGH CLEANING ANYWAY AND THAT'S BEEN ENHANCED FURTHER- WE HAVE ONLINE TICKETING. AND WE CAN ADJUST OUR AUDIENCES HE WANTED 25% ONE OF THE 10% BACK UP TO FORTY WE CAN DO IT AND WE DO IT WITH- ONE TO ONE COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR AUDIENCE YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE WHERE WE CAN HAVE A HEALTH SCREEN. PROMOTE PROTOCOLS WE CAN. CREATE CONTACT TRACING THROUGH THAT WE HAVE TEMPERATURE CHECKS WHEN YOU GET THERE WHEN YOU GET THERE THE CALORIES ARE ONE WAY TRAFFIC WITH MARKS ON THE FLOOR. AND MOST RETAIL DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO THE LEVEL OF SAFETY THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER WE ARE READY AND WILLING TO SHARE THESE GUIDELINES WE HAVE ALREADY WITH THE REST OF THE NATION IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE READY TO RESTART THE ARTS THE ECONOMY JOBS TO CERTAIN COMMUNITIES. TO HELP PEOPLE RECOVER FROM STRESS TO LEARN TO BE INSPIRED AND WE NEED TO DO IT NOW SAFELY IT IS REALLY PAINFUL. TO BE A PUBLIC SERVICE LIKE OURS. AND CLOSED WHEN WE NOW WE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND THIS NEW DATA OF ALL OF THESE OTHER CITIES MUSEUMS BEING OPEN. SHOWS THAT IT IS SAFE TO BE IN MUSEUMS AND WE SHULD USE MUSEUMS TO HELP. EMPOWER CALIFORNIA THE ARTS THE ECONOMY. AND ALL OF US. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THOSE MOMENTS- WE REALLY HAVE HEARD QUITE A BIT TODAY AND EVERY ONE OF YOUR TESTIMONIES NOT REALLY ADDS TO THE RECORD. ADDS TO THE URGENCY OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO AS A STATE AND WE ARE AGAIN A ROAD DOWN IF YOU WANT TO SAY THIS A RIVER TOGETHER. AND AS WE DO THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO END THIS SO IF YOU DO HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE GOING TO ASK YOU- OKAY WE ARE GOING TO ASK YOU TO SUBMIT THOSE TO- TO THE RECORD AND WE DO HAVE OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ADRIN NAZARIAN THAT DOES HAVE SOME FINAL COMMENTS AND HAS BEEN LISTENING INTENTIONALLY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN I HAD TO STEP BACK IN- TO ASK A QUESTION TO THE CEO OF- OF- LA COUNTY MUSEUM OF ART THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. JUST WANTED TO KNOW FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE MICHAEL- WHAT WHAT CONVERSATIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH THE COUNTY. OF PUBLIC HEALTH I FIND IT ASTONISHINGLY INTERESTING THAT THE MALLS JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM ME ARE OPEN WHICH IS GOOD IT'S IMPORTANT. BUT THAT MUSEUMS ESPECIALLY MUSEUMS OF THE LARGE SCALE THAT- HAVE MUCH HOPE IN SPACES AND CAN BE MANAGED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFLOW OF INDIVIDUALS DOESN'T REACH CAPACITIES THAT WILL BE DETRIMENTAL TO ANYONE'S HEALTH TO GIVEN ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT MUSEUMS. BECOME A SOURCE OF REFUGE I MEAN AT A TIME LIKE THIS WITH THREE YOUNG KIDS ESPECIALLY WE'VE BECAUSE THEY LOOK TO SEE WHERE WE CAN GO WANT TO KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN AND WHERE THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN AND- AGAIN HOW CAN WE HELP AND- SPECIFICALLY FOR LA AREA HOW CAN THE ALLEY DELEGATION ALSO STEP IN AND HELP. BUT THEN MAYBE HELP ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS WELL WITH ALL OF OUR CALLERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU YEAH YES ACTUALLY WHEN DEVELOPED PROTOCOLS THAT ARE BEING USED NATION WHY. THEY WERE DEVELOPED WITH LOS ANGELES CITY AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND THIRD PARTY CONSULTANTS BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP. WE WERE READY TO RE OPENING IN JULY AND- WE SHARED OUR PARTICLES WITH EVERYONE. L. A. COUNTY WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH DR FERRER IN LA IN FACT SHE- LOVES MUSEUMS AS TOUCHLESS ENVIRONMENTS- BUT IT'S CALIFORNIA- THAT QUICK MUSEUMS IN THE LOWER. CATEGORY IN AS A JUNIOR L. L. A. BE- IT HAS TO BE MORE RESTRICTIVE NOT LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN CALIFORNIA. SO I DO BELIEVE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THOSE OF FLORIDIANS BUT GIVEN WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH THEM. I THINK IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO SPEAK WITH THEM THEY WOULD REALIZE THAT THEY IS THAT LA HAD PRIORITIZED THE ARTS BECAUSE WE ARE SAFE AND WE CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO. THE FACT THAT WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE FROM TRAVELING BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT TO DO IT ALL. SO WE'RE READY IT GETS CALIFORNIA AND NOW I NEED TO COMMUNICATE- BETTER AND I THINK CALIFORNIA- CAN BE CATEGORIZED MUSEUMS TO THEIR PROPER. STATUS AND THEN WE. CAN REOPEN EXCEPT. I YOU FOR THE CALL ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND FOR YOUR ANSWERED THAT REALLY. DOES HIT AT THE HEART OF WHERE SOME OF THIS. IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHY CAN WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE. FOR MANY PEOPLE. YEAH GOING INTO MALLS. OR LARGE RETAIL AND IT WAS IT APPEARS TO BE YOU KNOW- NO MAN MASK MANDATE I KNOW TEMPERATURE TAKING WHERE AS WE KNOW LIKE FOR EXAMPLE DISNEY IS TAKING TEMPERATURES EVEN TO ENTER DOWNTOWN DISNEY HANDWASHING STATIONS. ALL TYPES OF CAST MEMBERS- AVAILABLE TO ENCOURAGE EVEN IF A MASK SLIPS DOWN- SO THIS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION AND I DO THINK IT'S GOT TO BE ANSWERED- I AIRED WE DO HAVE A PUBLIC SPEAKER UP IN OUR CHAMBERS- AND WE'RE LOOKING WAY UP AT THE TOP OF THE GALLERY WELCOME.
