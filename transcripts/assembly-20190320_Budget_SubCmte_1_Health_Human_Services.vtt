CHANGES TO I'D JUST SAYS --

01:16:02.557 --> 01:16:03.358
THESE ARE THE MORE SIGNIFICANT

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:05.494
CHANGES BEING PROPOSED IN

OUR OFFICE IN OCTOBER WE DID A

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.666

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:12.834
TO ASSESS WHETHER IT'S MEETING

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:14.503
CERTAIN CORE PRINCIPLES FOR ANY

01:16:14.569 --> 01:16:16.371
REALIGNMENT AND WE REACH SUMMER

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:17.773
CONCLUSIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:18.974

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:20.943
REPORT THAT THERE IS A

01:16:21.009 --> 01:16:22.077
MISALIGNMENT TODAY.

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:23.512
MAINLY WORK AND REGARDING

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:26.648
REVENUE WHEN IT COMES TO I JUST

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.817
US BUT ALSO COUNTY COST AND I

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.252
JUST AS REFLECTING THEIR ABILITY

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:32.154
TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS --

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.989
SO WE SEE THAT THE PROPOSED

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.624
CHANGES TO THE IHS US COUNTY

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:36.858

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:41.596

OUR REPORT --

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:45.067
ONE THAT.

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:47.069
THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.537
THAT THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:49.938
YEAR PROCESS JUST MONITORING

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:51.473
REVENUES TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.109
COVERING COST OVER TIME BUT ALSO.

01:16:54.176 --> 01:16:55.811
BY REDUCING I JUST AS COUNTY

01:16:55.877 --> 01:16:57.446
COST THAT THEN SHIFTS I HIGHER

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:58.814
SHARE OF COSTS TO THE STATE

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:00.282
WHILE THIS IS APPROPRIATE THIS

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.017
DOES BRING UP QUESTIONS FOR

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.385
LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AROUND.

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.020

PRESSURES ON RIGHTEOUS AS BUT

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:09.958
ALSO MORE BROADLY --

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.761
AGAIN THE AGING POPULATION IN

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:15.130

SINGLE COUNTY AND OUR STATE.

01:17:49.464 --> 01:17:50.632
WE'RE PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE

STATE TO ADMINISTER THIS FEDERAL

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:54.669
ENTITLEMENT WHICH HAS NO CAP

01:17:54.736 --> 01:17:56.338
WHICH AS YOU HEARD EARLIER FROM

SO THAT THEY MAY AGE WITH

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.182
DIGNITY IN PLACE AT HOME.

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:08.583
CURRENTLY COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN

01:18:08.650 --> 01:18:11.353
THE REVENUES ANTICIPATED FROM

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.487
REALIGNMENT REVENUES.

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:14.623
WE ARE HAVING TO RE DIRECT FUNDS

01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:16.358
FROM VERY VITAL PUBLIC AND

THE COUNTY ADDITIONAL AYE HSS

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.769
COST SHARE THIS IS SIMPLY NOT

01:18:27.836 --> 01:18:30.338
SUSTAINABLE FOR YOUR FIFTY EIGHT

01:18:30.405 --> 01:18:32.240
COUNTIES NOR IS IT SUSTAINABLE

01:18:32.307 --> 01:18:33.575
FOR THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE

01:18:33.642 --> 01:18:34.409
SERVE.

01:18:34.476 --> 01:18:37.446
UNDER THIS VERY VITAL PROGRAM

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:39.848
PUZZLE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:41.616
THIS COMMITMENT FROM THE GENERAL

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:44.286
FUND BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND

NINETEEN AND TO AND INTO TWO

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:46.655
THOUSAND TWENTY AND WHAT IT

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:48.090
REALLY DOES IS IT PROVIDES IS

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:49.791
THAT FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY TO

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.760
BE ABLE. TO NEGOTIATE THESE

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.595
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

01:18:53.662 --> 01:18:55.697
TO BE ABLE TOMOVE FORWARD AND

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.365
WHILE THERE ISN'T A COP IT

01:18:57.432 --> 01:18:58.800
CERTAINLY PROVIDES AS THE FISCAL

01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:00.569
CERTAINTY THAT WE NEED TO ALL OF

01:19:00.635 --> 01:19:02.104
US TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.772
WHETHER IT'S ON THE COUNTY SIDE

01:19:03.839 --> 01:19:05.607
OR ON THE BARGAINING SIDE.

01:19:05.674 --> 01:19:07.242
BY LOWERING THE MOE BASED AND

01:19:07.309 --> 01:19:08.677
REDUCING THE ANNUAL INFLATION

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:11.546
FACTOR FROM 724% WE SEE A

01:19:11.613 --> 01:19:13.081
RECOGNITION OF THE TWO GREATEST

01:19:13.148 --> 01:19:14.783
FACTORS THAT ARE DRIVING THE

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.418
SITE JUST ASK COSTS ONE IS THE

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:17.719
STATE MINIMUM WAGE.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:18.687
AND THE OTHER IS THE

01:19:18.753 --> 01:19:20.288
IMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.456
OVERTIME RULES.

01:19:21.523 --> 01:19:22.924
BOTH OF THESE ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.893
CONTROL OF EACH OF YOUR FIFTY

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.994
EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:27.395
THESE REALIGNMENT REVENUES

01:19:27.462 --> 01:19:31.166
SIMPLY ARE NOT ENOUGH WITHOUT

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:32.067
THIS PROPOSAL IN PLACE.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:33.535
REDUCING THE INFLATION FACTOR

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:36.037
24% IS ESSENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:37.105
PROVIDE THE STRUCTURAL

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.573
SUSTAINABILITY IS FOR COUNTIES

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.075
TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:19:40.142 --> 01:19:41.443
THAT ALIGNS ITSELF WITH

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.011
HISTORICAL REALIGNMENT REVENUE

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.880
GROWTH AND IS IN THE BALLPARK OF

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.615
THE ANNUAL PROGRAM CASE LOAD

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:47.482
GROWTH.

01:19:47.549 --> 01:19:50.051
THIS ENSURES THAT WE CAN PLACE

01:19:50.118 --> 01:19:51.853
VITAL DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC AND

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.788
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES RESTORING

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.323
THOSE SERVICES TO ALL OF OUR

01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:56.491
RESIDENTS.

01:19:56.558 --> 01:19:58.226
THIS PROPOSAL WHILE IT DOES NOT

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.127
ELIMINATE THE RISK OF

01:19:59.194 --> 01:20:00.595
REALIGNMENT

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:02.931
AND IT DOES NOT PROVIDE A CAP IT

01:20:02.998 --> 01:20:04.566
CERTAINLY DOES PROVIDE AN

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.834
IMPROVED OUTLOOK FOR THOSE

01:20:05.901 --> 01:20:08.436

HSS SUPPORT SERVICE PROGRAMS TO

01:20:16.011 --> 01:20:18.213
ALLOW THEM. TO AGE WITH DIGNITY

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.075
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:48.443
MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BOSS

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:49.911
HAMILTON I'M HERE.

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:52.380
REPRESENTING YOU W. ASKED ME.

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.349
WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED TEN

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.717
THOUSAND I JUST US WORKERS IN

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:57.419
TWENTY ONE COUNTIES.

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:59.221
I THINK ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.122
COULD AGREE THAT I HSS IS A

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.959
LIFESAVING CRITICAL PROGRAM FOR

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:06.161
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:21:06.228 --> 01:21:08.496
WE'RE HERE OUT OF DESPERATION

01:21:08.563 --> 01:21:11.199
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IN AYE HSS

01:21:11.266 --> 01:21:12.567
IS THE WORK FORCE.

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:15.370
PROBLEM WE CANNOT HIRE ANOTHER

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.305
FOR WORKERS TO DO THIS JOB

01:21:17.372 --> 01:21:20.909
BECAUSE IT PAYS VERY VERY LITTLE.

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:22.210
SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ARE

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:25.280
PROPOSING IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.648
PROPOSAL.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.016
TO ADD ADDITIONAL GENERAL FUND

01:21:28.083 --> 01:21:30.352
SUPPORT TO OFFSET COUNTY COSTS

01:21:30.418 --> 01:21:32.921
THAT IT BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:21:32.988 --> 01:21:34.556
THE ABILITY OF A COUNTY TO REACH

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:35.824
A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.425
AGREEMENT WITH ITS WORKERS.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.028
WE HAVE BEEN TO THIS BUDGET CAN

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:42.197
TIMES IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN

01:21:42.264 --> 01:21:44.165
YEARS TO DISCUSS THE PROBLEMS

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.400
THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH LOCAL

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:46.901
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND OUR

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.970
INABILITY TO GET RESOLUTION AT

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:50.205
THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH IS

01:21:50.272 --> 01:21:52.173
ESSENTIALLY FORCES US TO COME TO

01:21:52.240 --> 01:21:54.309
THE STATE. TO SEEK INTERVENTION

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.077
THIS IS A PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.513
THAT THE STATE MUST INTERVENE ON

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.049
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:02.484
TO KEEP PAYING THESE WORKERS.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:03.785

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:09.858
I PASSED --

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.426
I ASKED THE SERGEANT TO PASS OUT

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:12.861
A CHART.

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.095
YOU YOU SHOULD HOPEFULLY HAVE IT

01:22:14.162 --> 01:22:15.330
IN FRONT OF YOU IT LISTS ARE

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.032
TWENTY ONE COUNTIES.

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.533
JUST TO GIVE YOU A REALLY QUICK

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.168
SNAPSHOT THE COUNTIES THAT ARE

IN YELLOW ARE ALL OPEN CONTRACTS.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:24.906
THAT MEANS OUT OF THE TWENTY ONE

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.441
COUNTIES ONLY SEVEN HAVE

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.710
AGREEMENTS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:30.478
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COLUMN THAT

01:22:30.545 --> 01:22:33.081
SAYS TIME SINCE EXPIRATION THAT

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.050
IS THE AMOUNT OF TIME SINCE THE

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.452
LAST CONTRACT EXPIRES THE

01:22:37.519 --> 01:22:39.220
AVERAGE TIME IS THIRTY FIVE

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:39.688
MONTHS.

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:41.189
THAT MEANS THE AVERAGE CONTRACT

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:42.557
HAS BEEN OPEN FOR ALMOST THREE

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.659
YEARS.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.528
IF YOU LOOK AT THE GREEN.

01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.595
THE GREEN ARE THE ONLY COUNTIES

01:22:47.662 --> 01:22:49.197
THAT EVEN PAY ABOVE THE MINIMUM

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.699
WAGE AND RIGHT NOW.

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:52.300
YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ONLY SEVEN

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:55.070
THAT PAY ABOVE THE MINIMUM WAGE.

01:22:55.136 --> 01:22:57.105
THAT IS A DISGRACE.

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.840
SO WE ARE ASKING THE STATE IS

01:22:58.907 --> 01:23:00.675
THAT BEFORE THE SAVINGS THAT YOU

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.077
ARE PROPOSING WHICH ARE IN

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.445
GENERAL A REALLY GOOD THING.

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.180
THAT IT BE LINKED TO THE ABILITY

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:07.182
OF A COUNTY TO BARGAIN CONTRACTS

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:10.051
WE HAVE BEEN TO THIS BODY BEFORE.

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.519
AND TO GIVE YOU REALLY QUICK

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:14.322
TIMELINE GOING BACK TO TWO

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.056
THOUSAND ELEVEN WE PETITIONED

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.858
THE STATE TO APPLY FOR COMMUNITY

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:18.326
FIRST CHOICE OPTION EXTRA

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:20.362
FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH INCREASE

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:22.297
THE FEDERAL OF PORTION THAT PAY

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.732
TOWARD I JUST SAYS.

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.433
THAT RESULTED IN A REFUND TO ALL

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.168
THE COUNTIES FOR THE AMOUNT THAT

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.703
THEY HAD EXPENDED ON THE PROGRAM

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.206
WE HAD DONE THAT IN ORDER.

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.841
TO REDUCE COSTS AND HAVE THAT

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:35.143
MONEY BE PUT BACK INTO I JUST AS

01:23:35.210 --> 01:23:36.911
WAGES AND THAT IDN'T HAPPEN.

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.213
I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT THE

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:40.348
COLUMN AS LAST NEGOTIATED WAGE

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:42.150
INCREASE YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT'S

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.618
THE THOSE ARE THE DATES OF THE

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.819
LAST TIME THAT.

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:46.221
COUNTIES AGREED TO INCREASE

01:23:46.287 --> 01:23:50.091
WAGES AS YOU CAN SEE THE AVERAGE

01:23:50.158 --> 01:23:51.693
THERE'S ABOUT FOUR YEARS THAT

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.228
MEANS THAT THESE WAGES ARE ONLY

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.562
INCREASING BECAUSE THE MINIMUM

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:55.897
WAGE IS INCREASING.

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.632
AND UNLESS WERE ABLE TO RESOLVE

01:23:57.699 --> 01:23:59.167
THIS LOCALLY IT WILL BRING US

01:23:59.234 --> 01:24:00.568
BACK TO THE STATE AGAIN AND

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:01.336
AGAIN.

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:03.872
FOR RESOLUTION.

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.373
IT IN THE WHEN YOU OF AFFORDABLE

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.509
CARE ACT WAS PASSED AND MEDICAID

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:09.210
EXPANSION HAPPENED.

01:24:09.277 --> 01:24:10.445
THE ONLY WAY WE WERE ABLE TO GET

01:24:10.512 --> 01:24:12.313
WAGE INCREASES AT THAT TIME WAS

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.915
BECAUSE WE AGREE TO SHIP THE

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.316
DOLLARS AND CENTS THAT WERE

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:16.885
BEING PUT INTO HEALTH BENEFITS.

01:24:16.951 --> 01:24:18.720
TO ADD THAT TO WAGES BECAUSE ALL

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.488
THOSE WORKERS QUALIFY FOR MEDI

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:21.656
CAL.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.658
AND SO THERE WAS NO NET COST TO

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.193
THAT BUT IT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO

01:24:25.260 --> 01:24:28.229
SEE ANY DOLLAR AND SENT INCREASE

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:29.831
FOR THESE WORKERS.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.199
IN TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THE MO YOU

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:33.001
WAS PASSED THAT ESSENTIALLY

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:35.703
RENDERED COUNTIES OF A NEUTRAL

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.338
FOR ANY OTHER COSTS IN THE

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.973
PROGRAM ASIDE FOR THE GROWTH

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:40.141
FACTOR.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.843
IN FOR WHATEVER THEY BARGAINED

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.745
IN CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:46.681
NOTHING THAT RESULTED IN NO NAY

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.650
INCREASES EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.518
THE GOOD COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.220
DOING THEIR DUE DILIGENCE.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.522
AND THEN FINALLY IN TWENTY

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:55.857
SEVENTEEN WE HELP TO PASS AS

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.325
BEING NINETY WHICH INCLUDED

01:24:57.392 --> 01:24:59.227
OTHER INCENTIVES FOR BARGAINING

01:24:59.294 --> 01:25:01.830
SUCH AS MANDATORY MEDIATION.

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.565
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT BINDING.

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:04.866
THERE WAS NO WAY FOR US TO GET

01:25:04.933 --> 01:25:06.768
THE COUNTY TO ADOPT WHATEVER IT

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:08.269
WAS THAT A MEDIATOR WOULD AGREE

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.171
TO OR WOULD RECOMMEND AS AS

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.240
BEING A NEUTRAL.

01:25:12.307 --> 01:25:13.107
OF RESOLUTION.

01:25:13.174 --> 01:25:14.209
AND FINALLY WE ASK FOR

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.811
XCELERATED A CASE LOAD GROWTH

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:18.613
FUNDS TO BE SO THAT WHATEVER

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.914
THAT MONIES THAT WERE OUTWEIGHED

01:25:19.981 --> 01:25:21.216
BY THE COUNTY WILL GET REFUNDED

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.350
BACK TO THEM AS QUICK AS

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:23.251
POSSIBLE.

01:25:23.318 --> 01:25:25.153
THE REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND NOT

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:27.055
DIDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE EITHER.

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.857
SO WE'RE NOT HERE SAYING THAT.

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:31.125
ALL COUNTIES ARE ARE BAD ACTORS

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.594

01:41:19.006 --> 01:41:20.073
QUESTION I MEAN THE FIRST --

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:21.675
AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY

01:41:21.742 --> 01:41:22.643
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE I

01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:24.311
JUST SAYS PROGRAM IS AN ISSUE

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:26.213
BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.681
THE REPRESENTATIVE UNION FOR

01:41:27.748 --> 01:41:29.149
THAT THOSE COUNTIES --

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:30.217
SO I'M NOT GOING TO OFFER

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:32.019
SPECIFICS OR IN ANYWAY INTRUDE

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:34.087
ON THAT RELATIONSHIP WHAT WHAT I

01:41:34.154 --> 01:41:35.522
WILL SAY --

01:41:35.589 --> 01:41:37.291
IS THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU --

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:39.927
IS IS ONE POTENTIAL METHOD OF

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:41.962
INCENTIVIZING ACHIEVING AN

01:41:42.029 --> 01:41:42.963
AGREEMENT --

01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:44.665
THERE ARE PROBABLY OTHER WAYS TO

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.033
DO SO AS WELL --

01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:47.201
I THINK FROM THE STATE

01:41:47.267 --> 01:41:49.970
PERSPECTIVE --

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:50.804
WHAT WE WOULD SAY IS THAT?

01:41:50.871 --> 01:41:52.039
OUR GOAL AND THE REASON THAT

01:41:52.105 --> 01:41:53.073
THOSE OF US WHO WORK IN THIS

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.608
PROGRAM WORK IN A PROGRAM IS

01:41:54.675 --> 01:41:57.110
THAT PROTECTING AND SERVING THE

01:41:57.177 --> 01:41:58.812
I. H. ASSESS CLIENTS.

01:41:58.879 --> 01:42:00.380
PART OF THE JOB OF DOING THAT

01:42:00.447 --> 01:42:02.349
DEPENDS ON A STABLE WORK FORCE.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:05.085
OF PROVIDERS WILLING AND ABLE

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:06.420
AND FAIRLY COMPENSATED TO DO

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:07.855
THAT WORK --

01:42:07.921 --> 01:42:09.556
AND CLEARLY ACHIEVING OF

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:12.426
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT --

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:14.228
IT IS PART OF PROVIDING THE

01:42:14.294 --> 01:42:15.762
STABLE COMPENSATION.

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:17.264
THAT ENABLES THAT TO HAPPEN SO

01:42:17.331 --> 01:42:19.299
WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF OF PEOPLE A

01:42:19.366 --> 01:42:20.667
REACHING THOSE AGREEMENTS OF THE

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:21.802
LOCAL LEVEL --

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:23.337
BUT I'M NOT GOING TO PRESENT YOU

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.806
WITH POTENTIAL FISCAL OPTIONS

01:42:25.873 --> 01:42:27.174
AND WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE THAT.

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:28.475
ALTHOUGH WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:29.843
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WHEN IT

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:33.347
COMES TO STATE FUNDING DECISIONS.

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:34.481
WELL WHAT ABOUT TWO WHERE THE

01:42:34.548 --> 01:42:35.716
PARTY STARTS ON STATEWIDE

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.084
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AS AN

01:42:37.150 --> 01:42:41.255
ALTERNATIVE.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:42.789
UNDER THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION

01:42:42.856 --> 01:42:44.424
AS PART OF THE COORDINATED KAREN

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:46.093
ISSUED IF THERE WAS A STATEWIDE

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:47.461
AUTHORITY CREATED TO DO THAT

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:49.429
BARGAINING FOR A VARIETY OF

01:42:49.496 --> 01:42:51.365
REASONS I KNOW THEIR ACTUAL

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:54.668
AGREEMENTS WERE ENTERED INTO --

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:56.203
UNDER THE STATE WIDE AUTHORITY

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.205
AND THAT STATEWIDE AUTHORITY WAS

01:42:58.272 --> 01:42:59.773
THAT AND I WAS SUNSET AND

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.675
ELIMINATED --

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:03.143
WITH THE SECESSION.

01:43:03.210 --> 01:43:07.447
THE THIS MEDICARE INITIATIVE --

01:43:07.514 --> 01:43:10.117
BYE BYE BYE STATUTES SO I I

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:10.717
WOULD TELL YOU THAT IT'S BEEN

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:12.553
TRIED -- AND

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:14.021
AND WASN'T SUCCESSFUL IN THAT

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.456
CURRENT LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES

01:43:16.523 --> 01:43:16.990
THAT TO BE A LOCAL COUNTY

01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:18.058
DECISION.

01:43:18.125 --> 01:43:19.726
IF THAT WERE TO BE RE

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:22.729
IMPLEMENTED LEGISLATIVELY.

01:43:22.796 --> 01:43:24.097
WHAT WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION DO

01:43:24.164 --> 01:43:26.800
DIFFERENTLY? TO ENSURE THAT

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:28.635
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS

01:43:28.702 --> 01:43:29.903
COULD BE REACHED.

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:31.505
OF FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE

01:43:31.572 --> 01:43:33.040
WORKERS AND IN THE END THEY

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:37.144
ALLOW THE THE COUNTIES TO THEN --

01:43:37.210 --> 01:43:39.513
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 4%.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:40.881
AT THE TIME WE HAD A STATE WIDE

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:42.449
AUTHORITY THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:43:42.516 --> 01:43:43.817
THE BARGAINING LIED WITH THE

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:45.319
DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN OR

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:46.920
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.889
RESOURCES CALLIE CHAR --

01:43:48.956 --> 01:43:50.524
I'M NOT FEELING THAT I'M

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:51.992
PARTICULARLY IN A POSITION TO

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.660
GIVE YOU ADVICE ON WHAT THIS

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.195
ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO OR

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:56.330
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO BE

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:57.497
LEGISLATED.

01:43:57.564 --> 01:43:59.099
IF THERE'S CONSIDERATION OF THAT

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:00.567
OBVIOUSLY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:44:00.634 --> 01:44:02.836
WOULD WANT TO BE INVOLVED EARLY

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.271
IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS.

01:44:04.338 --> 01:44:06.673
THANK YOU.

01:44:06.740 --> 01:44:07.207
WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO

01:44:07.274 --> 01:44:09.309
RESPOND.

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:11.244
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR --

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:13.213
THE PILOT TO DO STATEWIDE

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:15.382
BARGAINING WAS I WOULD SAY

01:44:15.449 --> 01:44:16.717
ENTERED INTO SOMEWHAT

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.051
RELUCTANTLY BY THE PRIOR

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:20.287
GOVERNOR AND IT WAS ONLY IN

01:44:20.354 --> 01:44:21.388
SEVEN COUNTIES.

01:44:21.455 --> 01:44:22.789
IT WAS A LINK THROUGH TO THE

01:44:22.856 --> 01:44:26.660
pWHICH HAD A FAIRLY ROCKY START.

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.562
AND FRANKLY TOOK AWHILE TO GET

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:30.998
GOING AND I I THINK WASN'T QUITE

01:44:31.064 --> 01:44:32.899
AS SUCCESSFUL AS THE

01:44:32.966 --> 01:44:33.767
ADMINISTRATION HAD HOPED IT TO

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:34.601
BE.

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:35.969
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S TWO

01:44:36.036 --> 01:44:37.704
THINGS THAT WERE PREDOMINANT FOR

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.306
WHY IT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.240
OVERALL.

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:41.508
NUMBER ONE THE COURT NEED TO

01:44:41.575 --> 01:44:44.544
KAREN IS I'M BECAME CLEAR WAS

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:45.879
NOT GOING TO YIELD THE STATE

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:47.547
SAVINGS THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT

01:44:47.614 --> 01:44:49.016
IT WAS GOING.

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:49.750
TO AND I BELIEVE THAT THE

01:44:49.816 --> 01:44:51.685
ADMINISTRATION ONLY AGREED TO DO

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:53.320
STATEWIDE BARGAINING WITH THE

01:44:53.387 --> 01:44:54.655
BELIEF THAT WHATEVER SAVINGS

01:44:54.721 --> 01:44:56.123
CAME OUT OF THE CC I WOULD

01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:57.724
ACTUALLY BE WHAT THEY USED TO

01:44:57.791 --> 01:44:59.159
FUND ANY SORT OF WAGE AND

01:44:59.226 --> 01:45:00.560
BENEFIT INCREASE.

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.629
AND THEN SECOND TO THAT --

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:03.997
I WOULD SAY IT WAS BECAUSE OF

01:45:04.064 --> 01:45:06.466
THE JUST GENERAL INSTABILITY AND

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.769
THE FACT THAT THE PER THE LAW

01:45:08.835 --> 01:45:10.137
THAT.

01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:11.004
CREATED THE STATE WIDE

01:45:11.071 --> 01:45:12.973
BARGAINING WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.307
BARGAIN OVER WAS ACTUALLY

01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:16.243
EXTRAORDINARILY NARROW AND SO

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:18.478
THERE WAS JUST PROBLEMS WITH YOU

01:45:18.545 --> 01:45:19.680
KNOW WHAT IT WAS THAT WE COULD

01:45:19.746 --> 01:45:21.815
EVEN DISCUSS AT THE TABLE SO.

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.550
FRANKLY I WOULDN'T USE THAT AS

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.118
AN EXAMPLE WHY IT WOULDN'T BE

01:45:25.185 --> 01:45:26.620
SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE I THINK

01:45:26.687 --> 01:45:28.055
WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:29.456
A NEW POLITICAL WILL.

01:45:29.523 --> 01:45:30.991
IT WOULD BE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:32.659
SCENARIO AND WE WOULD SUPPORT

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:34.928
THAT A 100% WE JUST HAVE TO DEAL

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.596
WITH THE REALITY THAT THAT'S NOT

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.365
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON.

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:39.900
AND SADLY UNTIL IT HAPPENS WERE

01:45:39.966 --> 01:45:42.869
WERE OUT WHERE WE'RE AT AND AND

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:43.437
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY

01:45:43.503 --> 01:45:44.337
THANK YOU.

01:45:44.404 --> 01:45:48.408
SO ARE MY NOTES CORRECT THAT

01:45:48.475 --> 01:45:51.244

01:45:51.311 --> 01:45:53.413
S. CI YOU --

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.749
COUNTIES DO HAVE COLLECTIVE

01:45:55.816 --> 01:45:59.186
BARGAINING THE REST DO NOT.

FIFTY EIGHT ON ONE DO YOU HAVE

01:46:08.028 --> 01:46:10.263

01:46:10.330 --> 01:46:11.965
A SMALL COPY OF THE BIG.

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:14.534
THE FRONT PAGE WE WILL GET IT TO

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:18.839

IS MONEY FROM THAT PROPOSAL --

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:40.127
COULD BE USED FOR WAGING LOCAL

01:46:40.193 --> 01:46:46.700
GOVERNMENTS.

01:46:46.767 --> 01:46:48.268

TRY TO REITERATE WHAT MY

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:51.404

REVENUES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO

01:47:29.509 --> 01:47:31.344
THE LOCAL COUNTY BUT WHAT THAT

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.680
MEANS IS WHEN THERE'S NO CUT TO

01:47:33.747 --> 01:47:35.549
THE PROGRAM TO FILL THE TOTAL

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:36.183
BUDGET.

PICKING UP SEVERAL HUNDRED

01:47:40.620 --> 01:47:41.955
MILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS THAT

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.456
OTHERWISE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:45.525
A BURDEN ON COUNTIES IN EXCESS

01:47:45.592 --> 01:47:47.194
OF THEIR AVAILABLE REVENUES SO

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:48.862
THERE'S NO SAVINGS BEING CREATED

01:47:48.929 --> 01:47:50.463
TO AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR THIS

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:51.131
IN FACT.

01:47:51.198 --> 01:47:52.799
IT'S AN ONGOING GENERAL FUND

01:47:52.866 --> 01:47:54.868
COMMITMENT TO FULLY MEET THE

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:58.038
COST OF THE I JUST SAYS PROGRAM --

01:47:58.104 --> 01:47:58.805
SO I HOPE THAT'S HELPFUL IN

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:00.340
EXPLAINING THERE ARE NO AVINGS

01:48:00.407 --> 01:48:02.242
IN THE PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:03.476
USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES.

01:48:03.543 --> 01:48:05.145
SO THE PROPOSAL IS JUST

01:48:05.212 --> 01:48:06.313
BASICALLY --

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.647
TRYING TO CREATE A THE BREAK

01:48:07.714 --> 01:48:09.316
EVEN AS FAR AS THE COSTS THAT

01:48:09.382 --> 01:48:11.151
ARE OUT THERE NOW.

01:48:11.218 --> 01:48:14.955
SO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE AREAS

01:48:15.021 --> 01:48:16.323
SHE KNOWS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE

01:48:16.389 --> 01:48:18.058
WENT THROUGH A PERIOD OF WHERE --

01:48:18.124 --> 01:48:18.959
WE THOUGHT THAT --

01:48:19.025 --> 01:48:20.026
THE STATE WAS GOING TO BE

01:48:20.093 --> 01:48:21.361
NEGOTIATED SOME OF THESE THINGS

01:48:21.428 --> 01:48:22.596
AND IT DIDN'T HAPPEN NOW IS BACK

01:48:22.662 --> 01:48:24.030
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:48:24.097 --> 01:48:26.967
BUT YOU ALSO SEE WHERE THERE'S

01:48:27.033 --> 01:48:28.702
BEEN SOME --

01:48:28.768 --> 01:48:29.703
DIFFERENT --

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:31.538
FRACTIONS AS FAR AS TRYING TO

01:48:31.605 --> 01:48:34.341
GET CONTRACTS APPROVED AND STILL

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:36.209
NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON AND YOU

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:36.743

01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:38.645
MINIMUM WAGE YOU SEE SOME OF

01:48:38.712 --> 01:48:39.846
THESE THINGS ARE THERE.

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.648
AND BRINGING UP SAN MARINO

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:44.017
COUNTY THAT'S BEEN TRYING TO GET --

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:46.353
CLOSURE ON ON AGREEMENT FOR MANY

01:48:46.419 --> 01:48:47.220
YEARS AND I THINK IT'S OR FIVE

01:48:47.287 --> 01:48:48.121
YEARS.

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.724
THAT HAS BEEN THERE AND THE TALK.

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:54.227
AS FAR AS BEING TO BEING ABLE TO

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:55.495
INCREASE THOSE WAGES.

01:48:55.562 --> 01:48:57.130
WOULD THAT FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:58.064
COME FROM THE STATE WE'RE

01:48:58.131 --> 01:48:59.633
HEARING DIFFERENT SPEAKERS COME

01:48:59.699 --> 01:49:01.268
OUT AND TALK ABOUT TIENE SOME OF

01:49:01.334 --> 01:49:03.036
THIS --

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:05.839
NEGOTIATIONS TO TO THE LOCAL

01:49:05.906 --> 01:49:08.475
GOVERNMENTS SO IF YOU'RE SAYING

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:09.943
THERE'S NO --

01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:12.579
WHERE TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN AN

01:49:12.646 --> 01:49:14.414
INCREASE COMING FROM THE MONEY

01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:16.616
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED NOW HOW DO

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:18.652
WE GET TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:20.320
CAN START TO DISCUSS?

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.989
THE WAGE INCREASES AND FROM THE

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:25.358
STATE COMING DOWN TO THE COUNTY

01:49:25.425 --> 01:49:26.860
TO HELP WITH THOSE WAGE

01:49:26.927 --> 01:49:30.430
INCREASES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:32.098
I'M IN A DEFERRED TO SOME OF THE

01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.934
OTHER PANEL MEMBERS STATE TO ADD

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.802
TO IT TO THAT CONVERSATION AGAIN

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:37.404
THE BARGAINING RELATIONSHIP AS I

01:49:37.470 --> 01:49:39.506
COUNTY UNION AND NOT COUNTY

01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:42.008
ISSUE DOT FOR THE STATE TO

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:43.310
ADDRESS I I I GET THAT OUT.

01:49:43.376 --> 01:49:44.711
WHAT WE BUT THERE'S FUNDING AND

01:49:44.778 --> 01:49:46.479
FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AT THE

01:49:46.546 --> 01:49:49.049
STATE COULD ALSO OFFER TO THE

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:50.884
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WOULD?

01:49:50.951 --> 01:49:52.252
HELP IN SOME OF THOSE

01:49:52.319 --> 01:49:54.688
NEGOTIATIONS THAT ARE CONDUCTED

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:57.023
PURELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:58.425
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS

01:49:58.491 --> 01:49:59.459
LIKE THIS THE STATE COULD

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:00.994
POTENTIALLY OFFER --

01:50:01.061 --> 01:50:01.962
OBVIOUSLY USUALLY THE

01:50:02.028 --> 01:50:04.331
NEGOTIATION OVER OVER WAGES AND

01:50:04.397 --> 01:50:06.566
AND BENEFITS IS IS A FISCAL ONE

01:50:06.633 --> 01:50:07.801
LISTEN TO STAKE ASSEMBLY

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:10.637
ALLOCATE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:10.870
PURPOSE.

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:11.838
IT COULD.

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:14.040
DO WHAT THIS PROPOSAL FOR YOU

01:50:14.107 --> 01:50:16.843
FROM UT W. AND I SEE I YOU DOES --

01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:18.812
WHICH IS KEEP THE COUNTY MO WE

01:50:18.878 --> 01:50:20.347
HIRE UNLESS THERE'S A A

01:50:20.413 --> 01:50:22.015
BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN PLACE IN

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:24.050
WHICH CASE THE COUNTY YOU WOULD

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.952
THEN HAVE A LOWER AND WE AND

01:50:26.019 --> 01:50:27.187
MONEY TO PAY FOR IT.

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:28.688
THAT THAT'S ONE POTENTIAL

01:50:28.755 --> 01:50:30.957
STRUCTURES WELL I'M RELUCTANT TO

01:50:31.024 --> 01:50:33.059
ADVOCATE ANY PARTICULAR SOLUTION

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:34.527
HERE BUT THAT'S ROUGHLY HOW THE

01:50:34.594 --> 01:50:36.863
MECHANICS HERE IN IDEAS PRETTY

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:39.299
MUCH.

01:50:39.366 --> 01:50:39.833
GETTING A DEPARTMENT FINDS

01:50:39.899 --> 01:50:41.034
MISTER TRINKETS RIGHT TO EXTEND

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.268
THE IT'S APPROPRIATE THE STATE

01:50:42.335 --> 01:50:43.303
WHAT THEY WANT TO USE GENERAL

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:46.873
FUND. FOR JUST PROVIDING --

01:50:46.940 --> 01:50:49.709
WAGE INCREASE --

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:51.978
TO TO BE DONE TO BUT WE'RE DOING

01:50:52.045 --> 01:50:52.479
IT ON ON ON SIR MACINNES

01:50:52.545 --> 01:50:53.380
REWORKED.

01:50:53.446 --> 01:50:54.481
PAYING FOR MINIMUM WAGE ALREADY

01:50:54.547 --> 01:50:56.116
FOR THOSE FOR COUNTIES OR ARE AT

01:50:56.182 --> 01:50:58.985
THE MINIMUM WAGE AT THE MOMENT --

01:50:59.052 --> 01:51:00.153
ME BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.689
IT'S LIKE THIS PRIORITY RIGHT

01:51:02.756 --> 01:51:04.057
RESOURCES ARE FRIDAY REDUCING.

01:51:04.124 --> 01:51:07.660
THE MAYBE GOVERNOR HAS ARE VERY --

01:51:07.727 --> 01:51:09.195
ROBUST BUDGET INCLUDING A LOT OF

01:51:09.262 --> 01:51:10.697
RESOURCES FOR NEW PRIVATE

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:13.366
PROGRAMS AND IT'S APPROPRIATE

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:15.402
AND IN THE DAY SO IT'S IT'S IT'S

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:16.236
JUST.

01:51:16.302 --> 01:51:18.271
NOW THAT THE BACK IS THAT THE

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:20.040
BEST WAY TO GO ABOUT WITH THIS.

01:51:20.106 --> 01:51:21.741
IF I MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:23.209
IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:51:23.276 --> 01:51:24.544
WHATEVER THE BAR --

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:26.813
THE COUNTY CHOOSES TO BARGAIN IN

01:51:26.880 --> 01:51:28.181
TERMS OF IN A WAGER BENEFIT

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:29.282
AGREEMENT.

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:30.950
THE WAY THAT I JUST AS FUNDING

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.318
WORKS IS WHATEVER THE

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.187
EXPENDITURE IS SO WHATEVER THE

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:35.855
COST OF THAT WE DO BENEFITING

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:36.990
CREASE IS.

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.291
IT'S ACTUALLY MATCHED

01:51:38.358 --> 01:51:40.060
OVERWHELMINGLY BY STATE AND

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:42.028
FEDERAL FUNDING SO THE ACTUAL

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:44.631
DOLLAR INCREASE THE AMOUNT

01:51:44.697 --> 01:51:46.566
COMING OUT OF THE COUNTIES SHARE

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:48.334
IS ONLY SIXTEEN CENTS.

01:51:48.401 --> 01:51:50.203
AND THAT'S SIXTEEN CENTS COMES

01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:51.938
BACK TO THEM IN THE FORM OF

01:51:52.005 --> 01:51:53.640
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:54.174
SO THAT MAYBE [inaudible]

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.975
POINT.

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:58.378
YOU KNOW FIVE CENT ACTUALLY

01:51:58.445 --> 01:51:59.813
COMES OUT OF THEIR GENERAL FUND.

01:51:59.879 --> 01:52:00.947
SO THERE IS.

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:03.149
ACTUALLY NO REAL REASON WHY

01:52:03.216 --> 01:52:04.984
THESE WAGES AND BENEFITS WHAT

01:52:05.051 --> 01:52:07.387
WHAT HAPPENS IS WE GET PITTED.

01:52:07.454 --> 01:52:09.089
POOR PEOPLE AGAINST POOR PEOPLE

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:10.423
BECAUSE THEN WHAT THEY'LL SAY AS

01:52:10.490 --> 01:52:11.524
WELL IF WE PAY YOU.

01:52:11.591 --> 01:52:12.625
THEN WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:13.660
REALIGNMENT DOLLARS FOR MENTAL

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.995
HEALTH AND WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.097
FOR CHILD WELFARE AND WE WON'T

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:18.331
HOUND HAVE ENOUGH FOR EVERY

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.299
OTHER BUCKET.

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:23.069
THAT FALLS UNDER AYE HSS BECAUSE

01:52:23.136 --> 01:52:24.771
LOOK THEN EVERYONE ELSE IS GOING

01:52:24.838 --> 01:52:26.005
TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH WITH

01:52:26.072 --> 01:52:28.007
SERVICES THEY'RE NOT RECEIVING.

01:52:28.074 --> 01:52:29.676
AND WE REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT

01:52:29.742 --> 01:52:30.844
WE'RE PITTING POOR PEOPLE

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.979
AGAINST EACH OTHER FOR PENNIES

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:35.615
PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR THERE'S NO

01:52:35.682 --> 01:52:38.318
REAL REASON EXCEPT THAT IT'S A

01:52:38.384 --> 01:52:40.386
PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT.

01:52:40.453 --> 01:52:41.855
WITH WHAT IT IS THAT THESE

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:43.156
WORKERS DO.

01:52:43.223 --> 01:52:45.291
AND UNFORTUNATELY SO LONG AS

01:52:45.358 --> 01:52:46.392
THESE ARE DECISIONS MADE BY

01:52:46.459 --> 01:52:48.194
SUPERVISORS WHO FOR THE MOST

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:49.629
PART DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.431
FAMILY MEMBER SHOULD GET PAID

01:52:51.498 --> 01:52:51.998
FOR TAKING CARE OF FAMILY

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:54.267
MEMBERS BECAUSE LET'S BE REAL

01:52:54.334 --> 01:52:55.168
THAT'S WHAT REALLY WHAT THIS IS

01:52:55.235 --> 01:52:55.935
ABOUT.

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.170
SO LONG AS THAT'S WHO WERE

01:52:57.237 --> 01:52:58.972
MAKING THESE AGREEMENTS WITH.

01:52:59.038 --> 01:53:00.974
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE AT BECAUSE

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.709
IF I WAS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR I

01:53:02.775 --> 01:53:04.644
WOULD JUMP AT THE CHANCE THAT

01:53:04.711 --> 01:53:06.946
POINT FIVE CENT OF MY INVESTMENT

01:53:07.013 --> 01:53:08.781
IS GOING TO YIELD A DOLLAR IN

01:53:08.848 --> 01:53:09.782
RETURN.

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:11.151
THAT THEN WILL BE SPENT IN MY

01:53:11.217 --> 01:53:12.585
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND IN MY

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:13.953
LOCAL ECONOMY BECAUSE POOR

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.722
PEOPLE DON'T PUT IT INTO THEIR

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:16.923
FOUR ONE CASE AND THEY DON'T GO

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.458
BUY STOCK OPTIONS.

01:53:18.525 --> 01:53:19.592
THEY GO TO THE CORNER STORE BUY

01:53:19.659 --> 01:53:20.527
MILK.

01:53:20.593 --> 01:53:22.495
AND SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:25.064
THIS IS NOT AN ECONOMICALLY WISE

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:26.466
DECISION TO MAKE.

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:28.568
WE WE WE ARE HERE FOR SOLUTIONS

01:53:28.635 --> 01:53:30.170
BECAUSE WE SIMPLY AREN'T ABLE TO

01:53:30.236 --> 01:53:32.238
CHEAT THEM LOCALLY.

01:53:32.305 --> 01:53:34.574
THANK YOU AND AND ECOGNIZING --

01:53:34.641 --> 01:53:35.975
THE CHALLENGES OF THE COLLECTIVE

01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:37.777
BARGAINING AREAS DOWN AT THE

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:39.145
LOCAL LEVEL --

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.313
BUT KNOWING --

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:42.248
FROM MY EXPERIENCE ALSO THE HARD

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:43.349
WORK THAT --

01:53:43.416 --> 01:53:45.285
MEMBERS DO IS PARTICULARLY SEIU

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:46.986
IS SEVENTY OF COUNTY IN THE WORK

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:49.122
THAT THEY DO IN CARING FOR THOSE

01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:50.557
THAT ARE OUT THERE AND MANY

01:53:50.623 --> 01:53:51.624
TIMES THEY ARE FAMILY MEMBERS

01:53:51.691 --> 01:53:53.593
MANY TIMES THERE'S NOT BUT THAT

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:54.961
SHOULDN'T BE THE DISCUSSION.

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:58.565
THE DISCUSSION IS YOUR CARING

01:53:58.631 --> 01:54:01.167
FOR ECONOMIC VALUE IN OUR AREAS

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:02.468
AND FIRST THAT OUR COMMUNITIES

01:54:02.535 --> 01:54:04.103
ARE STRONGER WHEN HOME CARE

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:06.606
WORKERS CONTINUE. TO WORK BUT

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:07.774

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:11.344
TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR

01:54:11.411 --> 01:54:12.879
FAMILIES AND TRY TO TAKE CARE OF

01:54:12.946 --> 01:54:14.380
MANY OF THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:54:14.447 --> 01:54:15.715
WHICH YOU ONLY SEE THE

01:54:15.782 --> 01:54:17.617
POPULATION GROWING --

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:18.618

01:54:26.226 --> 01:54:27.827
REACH AN AGREEMENT AND PUTTING

01:54:27.894 --> 01:54:29.963
THAT INTO ONE OF THE PARAMETERS

01:54:30.029 --> 01:54:31.097
OF APPROVING --

01:54:31.164 --> 01:54:32.498

01:54:48.648 --> 01:54:50.516
AGREEMENT I THINK THIS IS A A

01:54:50.583 --> 01:54:51.417
FAIR.

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:53.186

MILLION PEOPLE ON SSI.

02:49:03.099 --> 02:49:04.300
BUT BROUGHT OUT REACH IS A

02:49:04.367 --> 02:49:06.135
TERRIFIC STRATEGY FOR ENROLLING

02:49:06.202 --> 02:49:08.638
ALL ELIGIBLE SSI RECIPIENTS.

02:49:08.705 --> 02:49:10.306

02:49:10.373 --> 02:49:12.008
MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:13.643
IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGE AND

02:49:13.710 --> 02:49:16.012
THAT'S PROCESSING A VERY LARGE

02:49:16.079 --> 02:49:17.580
VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS IN A VERY

02:49:17.647 --> 02:49:18.548
SHORT.

02:49:18.615 --> 02:49:20.350
WINDOW OF TIME --

02:49:20.416 --> 02:49:22.452
WE WENT THROUGH US SOMEWHAT

02:49:22.519 --> 02:49:23.987

02:49:31.761 --> 02:49:33.263
FROM THAT EXPERIENCE.

02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:35.031
AND THE BIGGEST LESSON WE

02:49:35.098 --> 02:49:36.366
LEARNED WAS THAT THE

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:38.968
UNANTICIPATED VOLUME --

02:49:39.035 --> 02:49:40.703
CREATED ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT

02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:43.306
CHALLENGES AND SO THAT LEADS --

02:49:43.373 --> 02:49:45.408
TO OUR BUDGET REQUEST ON THIS

02:49:45.475 --> 02:49:47.377

02:50:13.736 --> 02:50:15.738
ELIGIBLE AND GIVEN THE EXPANSE

02:50:15.805 --> 02:50:17.473
OF AN EXCELLENT OUT REACH WE DO

02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:19.208
EXPECT THAT IN CASTING THE NET

02:50:19.275 --> 02:50:20.743
AS WIDE AS POSSIBLE THERE WILL

02:50:20.810 --> 02:50:22.312
BE A SIGNIFICANT VOLUME FOR

02:50:22.378 --> 02:50:23.346
PEOPLE WHO ARE ULTIMATELY NOT

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:25.081
FOUND ELIGIBLE.

02:50:25.148 --> 02:50:26.449
AND THIS ONE TIME POT OF MONEY

02:50:26.516 --> 02:50:27.984
WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

02:50:28.051 --> 02:50:30.086
STAFF IN THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT

02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:31.387
THE ACTIVITIES LIKE THOSE.

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:32.455
THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN LOS ANGELES

02:50:32.522 --> 02:50:35.592
AND SO THAT WE EXTREMELY

02:50:35.658 --> 02:50:37.560
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WAITING IN

02:50:37.627 --> 02:50:38.962
COUNTY LOBBIES ARE WAITING FOR

02:50:39.028 --> 02:50:40.396
SOMEONE TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE

02:50:40.463 --> 02:50:41.998
TO GET BENEFITS THAT COULD

02:50:42.065 --> 02:50:43.700
LITERALLY BE LIFESAVING.

02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:45.368
THE SECOND PART OF OUR ASK IS AN

02:50:45.435 --> 02:50:46.436
ON GOING.

02:50:46.502 --> 02:50:48.404
THE FUNDING OF TEN POINT ONE

02:50:48.471 --> 02:50:50.540
MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND

02:50:50.607 --> 02:50:52.775
THIS IS A PRETTY SIMPLE REQUEST.

02:50:52.842 --> 02:50:54.277
WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

02:50:54.344 --> 02:50:56.279
STATE LAST YEAR TO ESTIMATE HOW

02:50:56.346 --> 02:50:58.114
MUCH WORK IS IT REALLY GOING TO

02:50:58.181 --> 02:50:59.349

ASSUMPTION.

02:51:07.390 --> 02:51:09.425
BUT IT FUNDS IT AS IF IT WERE

02:51:09.492 --> 02:51:11.527
THE YEAR.

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:12.128
TWO THOUSAND ONE SO THE UNIT

02:51:12.195 --> 02:51:13.663
COST TO THAT THE COUNTIES ARE

02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:15.832

02:51:21.638 --> 02:51:23.339
ERA.

02:51:23.406 --> 02:51:25.341
WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT TO DO

02:51:25.408 --> 02:51:26.709
ABOUT OUR BUDGET SO WE'RE JUST

02:51:26.776 --> 02:51:28.411

A JOB IN PREPARATION THAT I'VE

02:52:49.625 --> 02:52:51.761
EXPERIENCED IN MY YEARS OF BEING

02:52:51.828 --> 02:52:54.030
AN ADVOCATE IN SACRAMENTO AND

02:52:54.097 --> 02:52:54.931
WHILE WE ARE.

02:52:54.997 --> 02:52:56.566

02:52:56.632 --> 02:52:58.000
GLITCHES WE ARE REALLY HOPEFUL

02:52:58.067 --> 02:52:59.802
AND THE RECIPIENTS AS YOU HEARD

02:52:59.869 --> 02:53:01.304
MANY OF THEM SPEAK TO IT.

02:53:01.370 --> 02:53:04.240
ARE REALLY EXCITED VERY EXCITED

02:53:04.307 --> 02:53:06.008
AND VERY GRATEFUL I THINK FOR

02:53:06.075 --> 02:53:08.077
THE CHANGE THE LEGISLATURE WAS

02:53:08.144 --> 02:53:08.845
ABLE TO GET DONE LAST YEAR IN

02:53:08.911 --> 02:53:09.946
THE BUDGET.

02:53:10.012 --> 02:53:11.347
SO -- OUR

02:53:11.414 --> 02:53:12.849
REQUEST --

02:53:12.915 --> 02:53:15.318
ARE IT WHEN WE DID THIS LANGUAGE

02:53:15.384 --> 02:53:17.453
LAST YEAR AS THOSE AND WHO WERE

02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:18.988
ON THE COMMITTEE AND WORK ON THE

02:53:19.055 --> 02:53:20.823
BUDGET NO IT CAME TOGETHER

02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:24.260
FAIRLY LATE IN THE PROCESS --

02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:25.828
AND THERE WAS A VERY INTENSE

02:53:25.895 --> 02:53:27.530
PERIOD OF NEGOTIATION --

02:53:27.597 --> 02:53:31.667
IN MAY LAST YEAR --

02:53:31.734 --> 02:53:32.235
AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE

02:53:32.301 --> 02:53:34.971
GOVERNOR THIS PROGRAM SO THAT

02:53:35.037 --> 02:53:37.240
WAS THE LINCHPIN OF THE DEAL

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:38.474
COMING TOGETHER WAS TO MAKE SURE

02:53:38.541 --> 02:53:38.975
THAT.

02:53:39.041 --> 02:53:40.676
NO FAMILY WHO HAD NECESSARY

02:53:40.743 --> 02:53:42.245
RECIPIENT WAS ALREADY ON SNAP

02:53:42.311 --> 02:53:43.713
BENEFITS --

02:53:43.780 --> 02:53:46.682
BECAME POORER DUE TO US

02:53:46.749 --> 02:53:48.584
PROVIDING SNAP BENEFITS TO SS

02:53:48.651 --> 02:53:51.687
RECIPIENTS AND THAT WAS CRITICAL

02:53:51.754 --> 02:53:52.522
TO GETTING THE DEAL DONE.

02:53:52.588 --> 02:53:54.490
I'M IN THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT

02:53:54.557 --> 02:53:55.725
OCCURRED AROUND THAT THERE WERE

02:53:55.792 --> 02:53:56.993
SOME THINGS THAT GOT.

02:53:57.059 --> 02:53:58.728
DECIDED ON THAT I THINK IN

02:53:58.795 --> 02:54:00.563
RETROSPECT WE MIGHT WANT TO READ

02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:02.398
THIS AT ALL FIRST OF ALL WE'RE

02:54:02.465 --> 02:54:04.233
VERY EXCITED THE GOVERNOR CAME

02:54:04.300 --> 02:54:05.835
RIGHT OUT IN JANUARY.

02:54:05.902 --> 02:54:09.272
AND MADE THIS A PER PROPOSED TO

02:54:09.338 --> 02:54:11.140
MAKE THIS A PERMANENT PROGRAM.

02:54:11.207 --> 02:54:12.542
AND YOU KNOW THAT WAS.

02:54:12.608 --> 02:54:14.310
FRANKLY ONE OF OUR MAJOR BUDGET

02:54:14.377 --> 02:54:15.778
ASK COMING INTO THIS YEAR AND SO

02:54:15.845 --> 02:54:17.046
THE GOVERNOR PUT THAT ON THE

02:54:17.113 --> 02:54:18.781
TABLE JANUARY ONE WE CERTAINLY

02:54:18.848 --> 02:54:20.116
EMBRACE AND SUPPORT THAT.

02:54:20.183 --> 02:54:22.351
WE THINK WITH THAT THEN WE

02:54:22.418 --> 02:54:23.786
SHOULD ALSO --

02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:24.854
ELIMINATE LANGUAGE FROM THE

02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:26.923
STATUTE NOW THAT SAYS THAT THIS

02:54:26.989 --> 02:54:28.357
PROGRAM IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT

02:54:28.424 --> 02:54:29.492
BECAUSE THAT IS WHY THAT

02:54:29.559 --> 02:54:31.460
LANGUAGE WAS ADDED WAS BECAUSE

02:54:31.527 --> 02:54:32.562
THE GOVERNOR WAS ONLY AT THAT

02:54:32.628 --> 02:54:33.896
POINT WILLING TO COMMIT.

02:54:33.963 --> 02:54:35.765
A POT OF MONEY HOPEFULLY FOR

02:54:35.832 --> 02:54:36.732
ABOUT TWO YEARS THAT WOULD DO

02:54:36.799 --> 02:54:38.367
THAT SO WE ARE ASKING THE

02:54:38.434 --> 02:54:40.236
LEGISLATURE TO TAKE THOSE ABOUT

02:54:40.303 --> 02:54:40.803
LANGUAGE OUT ANSWERED OTHER

02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:41.704
LANGUAGE.

02:54:41.771 --> 02:54:44.974
BUT AS WE HAVE ANOTHER ALL OUR

02:54:45.041 --> 02:54:46.309
OTHER PHONE SINCE FOR THE

02:54:46.375 --> 02:54:48.110
FAMILIES [inaudible]

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:51.414
TO I'M DID THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:53.683
CHANGE IS WE PUT ON VERY

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:55.451
RESTRICTIVE RULES ABOUT WHAT

02:54:55.518 --> 02:54:57.153
HAPPENS TO FAMILIES WHEN THEY

02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:58.521
FALL OFF THE CASE LOAD --

02:54:58.588 --> 02:55:00.723
AS WE KNOW AND CAL FRESH ABOUT

02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:02.491
25% OF THE OF THE HOUSEHOLD TO

02:55:02.558 --> 02:55:03.926
COME UP FOR RE DETERMINATION.

02:55:03.993 --> 02:55:06.028
FALL OFF OF THE CASELOAD AT SOME

02:55:06.095 --> 02:55:07.530
POINT SO THERE'S A LOT OF

02:55:07.597 --> 02:55:09.198
TURNOVER IN THE PROGRAM WELL THE

02:55:09.265 --> 02:55:10.900
WAY THIS PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED

02:55:10.967 --> 02:55:12.101
ONE OF THEM --

02:55:12.168 --> 02:55:13.636
REQUIRES THAT ANYONE A FALSE UP

02:55:13.703 --> 02:55:16.038
ONLY GET THIRTY DAYS TO REAPPLY

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:18.507
AND IF THEY DON'T GET HIM IN

02:55:18.574 --> 02:55:18.841
THAT.

02:55:18.908 --> 02:55:20.009
THIRTY EIGHT THAT'S IT THEY LOSE

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:21.944
THAT CAL FOR THEY LOSE THAT HOLD

02:55:22.011 --> 02:55:24.013
HARMLESS BENEFIT FOR EVER --

02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:25.181
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE

02:55:25.248 --> 02:55:26.916
REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE REVISIT

02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:28.718
IT AND CHANGE SO THAT THOSE

02:55:28.784 --> 02:55:30.453
RULES OPERATE JUST LIKE CAL

02:55:30.519 --> 02:55:32.321
FRESH DOES IF SOMEBODY GOES OFF

02:55:32.388 --> 02:55:34.090
THEY CAN COME BACK WHEN THEY'RE

02:55:34.156 --> 02:55:35.725
READY TO REAPPLY GET READ A TERM

02:55:35.791 --> 02:55:38.027
AND GO BACK ON TO THE HOLD

02:55:38.094 --> 02:55:39.328
HARMLESS PROGRAMS.

02:55:39.395 --> 02:55:41.530
AND THEN ONE OTHER THING THAT WE

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:42.565
ANOTHER THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:45.668
TO GET DONE TO IS --

02:55:45.735 --> 02:55:46.769
TO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEIR BE

02:55:46.836 --> 02:55:49.138
PERSPECTIVE ENROLLMENT FOR THE

02:55:49.205 --> 02:55:50.673
SMB IN THE TEAM BE PROGRAMS.

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.742
ON THE WAY THE PROGRAMS IS

02:55:52.808 --> 02:55:54.176
WRITTEN OF GREAT STATUES WRITTEN

02:55:54.243 --> 02:55:57.179
IS IF YOU DO NOT YOU MUST HAVE

02:55:57.246 --> 02:55:58.948
AN SSI RECIPIENT IN YOUR

02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:01.217
HOUSEHOLD ON JUNE ONE TWENTY

02:56:01.284 --> 02:56:02.551
NINETEEN WHEN THE WHEN THE START

02:56:02.618 --> 02:56:03.252
DATE IS.

02:56:03.319 --> 02:56:06.188
AND IF YOU DON'T ANY FAMILY THAT

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:07.390
COMES AFTER THAT IS BARRED FROM

02:56:07.456 --> 02:56:09.292
GETTING THESE BENEFITS SO OVER

02:56:09.358 --> 02:56:12.995
TIME WHAT THIS IS GOING TO

02:56:13.062 --> 02:56:14.063
CREATE IS A TWO YOU KNOW TO

02:56:14.130 --> 02:56:14.697
CLASS SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE

02:56:14.764 --> 02:56:15.331
SOME FOLKS ARE GETTING A LITTLE

02:56:15.398 --> 02:56:16.599
BIT MORE.

02:56:16.666 --> 02:56:18.501
INCREASED AT AN EXACT SAME

02:56:18.567 --> 02:56:20.069

CONSTRUCTION OR GET A GET LOWER

02:56:22.204 --> 02:56:24.674
BENEFITS SO WE'RE ASKING THE

02:56:24.740 --> 02:56:26.575
LEGISLATURE TO REVERSE THAT AND

02:56:26.642 --> 02:56:28.377
TO HAVE JUST OPENED PERSPECTIVE

03:11:53.935 --> 03:11:55.003
SOME CONFUSION THAT WE HEARD A

03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:56.671
LOT LAST WEEK DURING OUR SENATE

03:11:56.738 --> 03:11:57.973

AND AND CONCERN AND FEAR ON THE

03:12:01.910 --> 03:12:03.478
PART OF PROVIDERS AND AND

03:12:03.545 --> 03:12:04.980

03:12:11.553 --> 03:12:12.354
CLOCK.

03:12:12.420 --> 03:12:16.892

MY EXPECTATION AND THAT IS NOT.

03:12:19.394 --> 03:12:20.962
WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IT'S BEEN

03:12:21.029 --> 03:12:22.831

TO TRY AND A LAY SOME OF THAT

03:12:26.434 --> 03:12:28.737
FEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

03:12:28.803 --> 03:12:30.071
CAN BE FILLED OUT ON A DAILY

03:12:30.138 --> 03:12:32.173

IT EITHER THROUGH THE COMPUTER

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:54.729
OR BY THE PHONE

03:12:54.796 --> 03:12:56.231
AND TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO

03:12:56.298 --> 03:12:57.465
DO THAT AND THE WAY THAT AGAIN

03:12:57.532 --> 03:13:00.168
MAKES IT THE EASIEST FOR THEM SO

03:13:00.235 --> 03:13:01.770
IF THAT'S DOING IT EVERY DAY.

03:13:01.836 --> 03:13:03.738

MANY ISSUES THAT WILL NEED TO BE

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.107
JOINTLY WORKED OUT WITH CONSUMER

03:19:13.174 --> 03:19:15.276

OUT TO OUR CONSUMER GROUPS AND I

03:19:19.881 --> 03:19:22.050
REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT.

03:19:22.116 --> 03:19:28.856

EDUCATION WITH OUR CONSUMERS ARE

03:19:37.365 --> 03:19:38.533
PROVIDERS.

03:19:38.599 --> 03:19:39.834
BECAUSE WE ARE SWITCHING AWAY

03:19:39.901 --> 03:19:42.236
FROM THE PAPER OF OF TIME SHEET

03:19:42.303 --> 03:19:43.571
SYSTEM.

03:19:43.638 --> 03:19:45.139
THE I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH THAT THAT

03:19:45.206 --> 03:19:47.442
THAT REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

03:19:47.508 --> 03:19:49.344
AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN A

03:19:49.410 --> 03:19:52.313
BIGGER WAY THAN WE HAVE EVER

03:19:52.380 --> 03:19:53.414
DONE BEFORE THANK YOU

03:19:53.781 --> 03:19:55.850
THANK YOU.

03:19:55.917 --> 03:19:58.086
YES MS RUBIO I JUST WANT TO MAKE

03:19:58.152 --> 03:19:59.320
A COMMENT ON THAT BECAUSE I'M

03:19:59.387 --> 03:20:00.121
DRIVING NUMBER LAST YEAR AND I

03:20:00.188 --> 03:20:01.622
DON'T MAY MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THE

03:20:01.689 --> 03:20:02.590
SAME ISSUE BY.

03:20:02.657 --> 03:20:03.791
BUT WE WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH

03:20:03.858 --> 03:20:05.927
THE THE PAPER TIME SHEETS I

03:20:05.993 --> 03:20:07.328
REMEMBER THAT A GROUP CAME AND

03:20:07.395 --> 03:20:08.463
THAT THEY WERE SENDING IN THE

03:20:08.529 --> 03:20:09.297
TIME SHEETS AND THEY WERE

03:20:09.364 --> 03:20:10.565
GETTING PAID FOR A MONTH IN

03:20:10.631 --> 03:20:12.066
ADVANCE SOMETIME SHEETS WERE.

03:20:12.133 --> 03:20:13.334
YOU KNOW CONSIDERED LATE IT WAS

03:20:13.401 --> 03:20:14.068
A BIG --

03:20:14.135 --> 03:20:16.204
MESSEL I I AGREE WITH YOU THAT

03:20:16.270 --> 03:20:17.605
WE HAVE TO DO THE EDUCATION BUT

03:20:17.672 --> 03:20:18.639
I THINK THIS IS A BETTER SYSTEM

03:20:18.706 --> 03:20:20.308
BECAUSE I REMEMBER LAST YEAR

03:20:20.375 --> 03:20:20.875
THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF

03:20:20.942 --> 03:20:21.743
COMPLAINTS ABOUT.

03:20:21.809 --> 03:20:23.845
THE TIME SHEETS NOT ONLY BEING

03:20:23.911 --> 03:20:25.713
OUTDATED BY THE FOLKS WERE NOT

03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:28.149
BEING PAID ON TIME SO IF WE CAN

03:20:28.216 --> 03:20:30.651
WORK TOGETHER ON ON HOW.

03:20:30.718 --> 03:20:31.386
TO YOU KNOW STREAMLINED THAT

03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:33.221
SYSTEM AND YOU'RE RIGHT EDUCATE

03:20:33.287 --> 03:20:34.989
THE COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY OR

03:20:35.056 --> 03:20:35.656
THE FOLKS ARE GONNA BE AFFECTED

03:20:35.723 --> 03:20:37.392
BY THE YOU KNOW ON OUR SIDE I

03:20:37.458 --> 03:20:38.926
HEARD THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT.

03:20:38.993 --> 03:20:40.395
YOU KNOW THE TIME SHEETS NOT

03:20:40.461 --> 03:20:41.796
BEING EFFECTIVE AND AND BEING

03:20:41.863 --> 03:20:43.765
LOST IN PEOPLE NOT GETTING PAID

03:20:43.831 --> 03:20:45.032
ON TIME SO FOR ME THE CONCERN.

03:20:45.099 --> 03:20:47.502
IS IS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY FOR THE

03:20:47.568 --> 03:20:48.603
IT COMMUNITY EDUCATION RIGHT

03:20:48.669 --> 03:20:49.237
THINK THIS MIGHT BE A BETTER

03:20:49.303 --> 03:20:53.808
SYSTEM SO THAT FOLKS GET PAID ON

03:20:53.875 --> 03:20:55.877
TIME [inaudible]

03:20:55.943 --> 03:20:58.579
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY.

03:20:58.646 --> 03:20:58.780
YEAH.

03:20:58.846 --> 03:21:00.314
THEY'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT A

03:21:00.381 --> 03:21:01.983
PHONE SYSTEMS AT THAT TAKING

03:21:02.049 --> 03:21:02.784
AWAY FROM THE PLACES THAT

03:21:02.850 --> 03:21:04.252
CURRENT FILE SYSTEM IS NOT A

03:21:04.318 --> 03:21:04.585
REALLY GOOD.

03:21:04.652 --> 03:21:07.422
SYSTEM SO WHATEVER THEY DO AND

03:21:07.488 --> 03:21:08.523
WHAT IS THE PROBABLY EIGHTY

03:21:08.589 --> 03:21:09.757
MAYBE IT THE PHONE SYSTEM NEEDS

03:21:09.824 --> 03:21:11.058
TO BE WORKED ON A FIXED FOR IT

03:21:11.125 --> 03:21:12.193
TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT EBV

03:21:12.260 --> 03:21:13.194
SYSTEM.

03:21:13.261 --> 03:21:15.196

03:21:15.263 --> 03:21:16.964

BEFORE THEY DESERVE TO LIVE.

03:21:18.366 --> 03:21:22.470
ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IF I'M

03:21:22.537 --> 03:21:25.640
HEARING YOU TO BE PATIENT

03:21:25.706 --> 03:21:27.074

THE CHANGING FROM THE PAPER.

03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:41.355
TO TO THE COMPUTER --

03:26:41.422 --> 03:26:43.724
IT ISN'T TO FAIL PROOF METHOD

03:26:43.791 --> 03:26:45.726
AND AS MS RUBIO IS INDICATED

03:26:45.793 --> 03:26:47.461
THAT SOMETHING THAT WE WILL GO

03:26:47.528 --> 03:26:49.897

03:26:50.998 --> 03:26:54.435
ADMINISTRATION EFFORTS MADE.

03:26:54.502 --> 03:26:56.604
ESPECIALLY IT INVITING AND

03:26:56.670 --> 03:26:57.972
INCLUDING THE STAKEHOLDERS --

03:26:58.038 --> 03:26:59.273
IT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEM AT

03:26:59.340 --> 03:27:01.075
THE TABLE ON THIS PARTICULAR

03:27:01.142 --> 03:27:02.176
SUBJECT.

03:27:02.243 --> 03:27:03.177
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS

03:27:03.244 --> 03:27:04.745
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT STARTED

03:27:04.812 --> 03:27:08.449
LAST YEAR AND HAS BEEN ONGOING.

03:27:08.516 --> 03:27:09.917
I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I I

03:27:09.984 --> 03:27:10.985
THINK WE CAN ALL APPRECIATE THAT

03:27:11.051 --> 03:27:12.686
THIS.

03:27:12.753 --> 03:27:13.821
WHEN YOU BRING STAKEHOLDERS

03:27:13.888 --> 03:27:14.855
TOGETHER TO ENHANCE IS THE

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:16.957
IMPLEMENTATION WORK FOR MAJOR

03:27:17.024 --> 03:27:19.293
PROGRAM CHANGE THAT WAS THAT

03:27:19.360 --> 03:27:21.362
CREATED AT FIRST A LOT OF?

03:27:21.428 --> 03:27:24.231
UNDERSTANDABLE APPREHENSION AND

03:27:24.298 --> 03:27:27.268
STILL SOME APPREHENSION RIGHT.

03:27:27.334 --> 03:27:28.736
DID FOR FOR WHAT MY OWN OPINION

03:27:28.803 --> 03:27:31.405
I WISH IT WAS NOT IMPLEMENTED

03:27:31.472 --> 03:27:31.772
HERE CALIFORNIA.

03:27:31.839 --> 03:27:32.840
YEAH.

03:27:32.907 --> 03:27:34.542
IN ORDER THE WORK THAT YOU'VE

03:27:34.608 --> 03:27:36.610
DONE THOáT DOES FACILITATE OUR

03:27:36.677 --> 03:27:39.513
COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW.

03:27:39.580 --> 03:27:41.348
AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:27:41.415 --> 03:27:43.317
REASON FOR ALL OF THIS --

03:27:43.384 --> 03:27:44.685
WELL NOT CAUSING A WE'RE TRYING

03:27:44.752 --> 03:27:46.353
TO DO THE BEST WE CAN THE

03:27:46.420 --> 03:27:48.589
DOESN'T CAUSE UNDUE HARDSHIP TO

03:27:48.656 --> 03:27:49.857
THE OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE

03:27:49.924 --> 03:27:52.226
INVOLVED WITH AND IMPACTED WITH

03:27:52.293 --> 03:27:54.762
THIS PROGRAM.

03:27:54.829 --> 03:27:56.730
THE THE ISSUE RELATES ALSO TO

03:27:56.797 --> 03:27:57.631
ISSUE NUMBER ONE THAT WE

03:27:57.698 --> 03:27:59.767
DISCUSSED EARLIER IN SOME WAYS

03:27:59.834 --> 03:28:01.235
ADDRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:28:01.302 --> 03:28:03.370
CODIFYING STATE POLICY WHAT

03:28:03.437 --> 03:28:05.072
MAKES SENSE TO DO.

03:28:05.139 --> 03:28:06.507
AND IN THIS CASE TO IN TRYING

03:28:06.574 --> 03:28:10.077
CALIFORNIA'S APPROACH EVD --

03:28:10.144 --> 03:28:11.378
AT ONE QUESTION FOR THE

03:28:11.445 --> 03:28:12.947
ADMINISTRATION IS WHAT ARE YOUR

03:28:13.013 --> 03:28:14.081
THOUGHTS.

03:28:14.148 --> 03:28:21.555
ON THIS CODIFICATION APPROACH.

03:28:21.622 --> 03:28:24.124
OF A COUPLE COMMENTS IF I IF I

03:28:24.191 --> 03:28:25.860
MAY FIRST TWO A GOOD ANSWER YOUR

03:28:25.926 --> 03:28:27.328
QUESTION WE HAVE NO OBJECTION TO

03:28:27.394 --> 03:28:28.596
THE CODIFICATION OF THE POLICY

03:28:28.662 --> 03:28:29.964
PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE GUIDED OUR

03:28:30.030 --> 03:28:31.465
WORK WE HELPED IN THE DRAFTING

03:28:31.532 --> 03:28:32.700
OF THEM LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET

03:28:32.766 --> 03:28:34.168
BILL LANGUAGE AND WE HAVE NO

03:28:34.235 --> 03:28:36.604
OBJECTION. TO CODIFYING THAT --

03:28:36.670 --> 03:28:38.105
WOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK ON

03:28:38.172 --> 03:28:40.074
LANGUAGE UNDERSTAND A REQUEST IS

03:28:40.140 --> 03:28:42.476
BEEN MADE --

03:28:42.543 --> 03:28:43.010
FOR FOR ONE OF THE GROUPS

03:28:43.077 --> 03:28:45.312
INVOLVED.

03:28:45.379 --> 03:28:47.047
TO WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO

03:28:47.114 --> 03:28:48.382
WORK AND DEVELOP THAT LANGUAGE

03:28:48.449 --> 03:28:50.284
OF THOSE PRINCIPLES ARE

03:28:50.351 --> 03:28:51.752
IMPORTANT THEIR STANDARD CONTENT.

03:28:51.819 --> 03:28:52.486
MISSION --

03:28:52.553 --> 03:28:54.121
IS ROSY HAVE.

03:28:54.188 --> 03:28:55.689
ARTICULATED THEM WHILE AND AND

03:28:55.756 --> 03:28:57.091
WE AGREE THERE IN OUR SLIDE DECK

03:28:57.157 --> 03:28:59.560
AS WELL SO HAPPY TO DO THAT.

03:28:59.627 --> 03:29:01.228
ON THE ISSUE THE PHONE WE KNOW

03:29:01.295 --> 03:29:02.563
IT'S NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE

03:29:02.630 --> 03:29:03.898
OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN ON THE

03:29:03.964 --> 03:29:05.032
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ELECTRONIC

03:29:05.099 --> 03:29:07.434
SERVICES PORTAL ONCE THAT HAS

03:29:07.501 --> 03:29:09.236
WORKED ITS WAY OUT THAT IS THE

03:29:09.303 --> 03:29:11.538
MODEL FOR THE FUNCTION THE ORDER

03:29:11.605 --> 03:29:12.539
OF QUESTIONS AND THINGS LIKE

03:29:12.606 --> 03:29:13.007
THAT.

03:29:13.073 --> 03:29:14.174
THAT WILL LEAD NOT JUST TO THE

03:29:14.241 --> 03:29:15.609
PHONE BUT TO THE MOBILE APP AS

03:29:15.676 --> 03:29:16.577
WELL.

03:29:16.644 --> 03:29:18.379
AND ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZING THE

03:29:18.445 --> 03:29:19.980

DON'T HAVE OF EVEN A TELEPHONE

03:29:26.287 --> 03:29:28.555
NUMBER ON FILE WITH US SO THERE

03:29:28.622 --> 03:29:29.924
WILL NEED TO BE A SYSTEM.

03:29:29.990 --> 03:29:32.493
OR SOME MECHANISM TO TO ENSURE

03:29:32.559 --> 03:29:33.661
THAT THEY'RE STILL ABLE TO

03:29:33.727 --> 03:29:35.296

03:29:38.065 --> 03:29:39.366
ISSUES WERE COMMITTED TO WORKING

03:29:39.433 --> 03:29:40.834

03:29:40.901 --> 03:29:42.369
ONGOING PARTNERSHIP.

03:29:42.436 --> 03:29:44.405

MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AT THE

03:29:51.545 --> 03:29:52.746

WHICH IS A REALLY BIG NUMBER.

03:30:09.163 --> 03:30:11.031
BUT THAT INITIAL PILOT WILL BE A

03:30:11.098 --> 03:30:12.733
COUPLE MONTHS SO THAT WE COULD

03:30:12.800 --> 03:30:14.668

APPRECIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT

03:50:00.386 --> 03:50:02.288

GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET

03:50:06.325 --> 03:50:08.361
PROPOSAL AND WHAT WE BELIEVE TO

03:50:08.427 --> 03:50:09.829
BE ABOUT A FIVE MINUTE MILLION

03:50:09.896 --> 03:50:11.531
DOLLAR SHORTFALL --

03:50:11.597 --> 03:50:13.366

FUNDING --

03:50:16.235 --> 03:50:19.238
WE BELIEVE THAT AS WAS POINT OF

03:50:19.305 --> 03:50:21.040
CALCULATIONS THAT WERE RELIED

03:50:21.107 --> 03:50:24.477
UPON THAT ARE NOT ACCURATE

03:50:24.544 --> 03:50:26.746
CALCULATIONS FOR THIS PURPOSE

03:50:26.812 --> 03:50:28.314
THE FIRST.

03:50:28.381 --> 03:50:30.283
ONE HAD TO DO WITH THE NUMBER OF

03:50:30.349 --> 03:50:31.884
BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT WERE

03:50:31.951 --> 03:50:33.419
ASSUMED AN AG ANY GIVEN YEAR THE

03:50:33.486 --> 03:50:35.454
ASSUMPTION WAS ABOUT FORTY FIVE

03:50:35.521 --> 03:50:38.057
THOUSAND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

03:50:38.124 --> 03:50:38.791
TWENTY SEVENTEEN D. O. J.

03:50:38.858 --> 03:50:39.659
NUMBERS.

03:50:39.725 --> 03:50:41.427
THERE WERE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

03:50:41.494 --> 03:50:42.428
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND UNDERTAKEN

03:50:42.495 --> 03:50:45.798
WERE CONTINUING TO DO INTERNAL --

03:50:45.865 --> 03:50:48.367
DETERMINATIONS TO FIND OUT --

03:50:48.434 --> 03:50:50.269
COUNTY BY COUNTY BY COUNTY --

03:50:50.336 --> 03:50:51.604
HOW MANY BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR

03:50:51.671 --> 03:50:52.772
UNDERTAKEN BUT WE DO THINK

03:50:52.838 --> 03:50:54.173
THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT AND THERE IS

03:50:54.240 --> 03:50:57.310
ABOUT A 30% TURNOVER RATE --

03:50:57.376 --> 03:51:00.179

03:51:03.416 --> 03:51:05.218
ASSUMPTION THAT REALLY WAS

03:51:05.284 --> 03:51:07.353

CASES WHICH IS.

03:51:11.290 --> 03:51:13.593
INSUFFICIENT STATEWIDE SECONDLY

03:51:15.628 --> 03:51:17.063
POINTED OUT IN THE ANALYSIS MY

03:51:17.129 --> 03:51:18.431
AND ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT --

03:51:18.497 --> 03:51:21.033
HAD TO DO WITH REFERRALS AND

03:51:21.100 --> 03:51:23.035
BASING IT ON ABOUT 8% OF

03:51:23.102 --> 03:51:25.571
