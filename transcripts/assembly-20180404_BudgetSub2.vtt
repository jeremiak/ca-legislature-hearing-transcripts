THE WE HAVE UPDATED INFORMATION

00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:51.951 region:rollup2
I'LL SHARE WITH YOU BUT I THINK

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.886 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.755 region:rollup2
KIND OF WHERE THE THE OFFICIAL

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:57.390 region:rollup2
DATA RESTS AT THIS POINT FROM

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:59.025 region:rollup2
DECEMBER.

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:00.693 region:rollup2
THERE WERE FORTY TWO QUALIFIED

00:15:59.025 --> 00:16:02.795 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS UP FROM THIRTY ONE A

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:04.564 region:rollup2
YEAR EARLIER. IT'S NOTABLE THAT

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:06.232 region:rollup2
SIX OF THOSE FORTY TWO WERE

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:07.667 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DOWNGRADES BY THE

00:16:06.232 --> 00:16:09.168 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE OF ED SO IN THAT

00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:10.736 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. THE DISTRICT SELF

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:13.239 region:rollup2
CERTIFY POSITIVE.

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:15.508 region:rollup2
AFTER THE COUNTY OFFICES REVIEW

00:16:13.239 --> 00:16:17.276 region:rollup2
THEY CHANGE THE CERTIFICATION TO

00:16:15.508 --> 00:16:17.844 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED IN DOWNGRADED I'M

00:16:17.276 --> 00:16:19.111 region:rollup2
BELIEVING THAT THEY DID NOT

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:20.947 region:rollup2
MEET.

00:16:19.111 --> 00:16:22.648 region:rollup2
THE CRITERIA FOR POSITIVE.

00:16:20.947 --> 00:16:24.450 region:rollup2
THERE WERE FOUR NEGATIVES UP

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:26.285 region:rollup2
FROM THREE THE PRIOR YEAR. ALL

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:28.988 region:rollup2
FOR IN THIS IS BECOME KIND OF

00:16:26.285 --> 00:16:30.423 region:rollup2
ROUTINE ALL FOR DISTRICTS THAT

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:32.558 region:rollup2
WERE NEGATIVE AT FIRST INTERIM

00:16:30.423 --> 00:16:34.026 region:rollup2
WERE NEW TO THE LIST.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:35.695 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY REFLECTION

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:37.663 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS WORKING.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:39.866 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS DON'T STAY ON A

00:16:37.663 --> 00:16:41.400 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE CERTIFICATION LIST VERY

00:16:39.866 --> 00:16:43.636 region:rollup2

00:16:43.636 --> 00:16:49.108 region:rollup2
FROM THE COUNTY OFFICE FROM ARE

00:16:47.273 --> 00:16:51.844 region:rollup2

00:16:55.248 --> 00:16:58.484 region:rollup2
GET THE DISTRICT BACK.

00:16:56.382 --> 00:16:59.652 region:rollup2
TO FISCAL HEALTH AND THEN THEY

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:01.654 region:rollup2
MOVE BACK THROUGH THE

00:16:59.652 --> 00:17:03.556 region:rollup2
PROGRESSION QUALIFIED ON AND

00:17:01.654 --> 00:17:04.490 region:rollup2
BACK TO POSITIVE IS ALWAYS THE

00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:06.692 region:rollup2
GOAL.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:08.461 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS PASADENA

00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:09.962 region:rollup2
FROM THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

00:17:08.461 --> 00:17:12.298 region:rollup2
BOB WHY THEY FILED A NEGATIVE

00:17:09.962 --> 00:17:15.101 region:rollup2
THEY WERE NOT NEGATIVE THEY USED

00:17:12.298 --> 00:17:16.302 region:rollup2
THIS PROCESS TO.

00:17:15.101 --> 00:17:17.937 region:rollup2
MORRIS A POLITICAL PROCESS TO

00:17:16.302 --> 00:17:19.038 region:rollup2
PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEIR THEIR

00:17:17.937 --> 00:17:21.140 region:rollup2
OWN BOARD.

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:23.209 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS NOT HOW THE SYSTEM

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.343 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED TO WORK THERE'S A

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:27.280 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PROCESS TO DO THAT.

00:17:24.343 --> 00:17:28.714 region:rollup2
AND SO AT SECOND IN A ROOM.

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.183 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:32.718 region:rollup2
BACK.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:34.754 region:rollup2
TO OF.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:36.489 region:rollup2
A QUALIFIED IN A POSITIVE STATUS

00:17:34.754 --> 00:17:38.257 region:rollup2
INGLEWOOD YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH.

00:17:36.489 --> 00:17:39.859 region:rollup2
AND I'M A TALK MORE ABOUT IT IN

00:17:38.257 --> 00:17:41.460 region:rollup2
JUST A SECOND FURTHER FALLS

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:43.129 region:rollup2
UNION OF VERY SMALL DISTRICT IN

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.697 region:rollup2
BUTTE COUNTY.

00:17:43.129 --> 00:17:46.632 region:rollup2
TEN STUDENTS.

00:17:44.697 --> 00:17:48.601 region:rollup2
THEY ARE GETTING FINANCIAL

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:50.036 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THIS YEAR AND FORECASTED

00:17:48.601 --> 00:17:51.804 region:rollup2
FOR NEXT YEAR FROM THEIR COUNTY

00:17:50.036 --> 00:17:53.539 region:rollup2
OFFICE FIVE OF THOSE TEN

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:55.541 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE IN SEVENTH GRADE

00:17:53.539 --> 00:17:58.311 region:rollup2
THIS IS A K. EIGHT DISTRICT. AND

00:17:55.541 --> 00:17:59.879 region:rollup2
SO THE GOAL IS TO GET THE FIVE

00:17:58.311 --> 00:18:02.248 region:rollup2
OF THE TEN KIDS OUT.

00:17:59.879 --> 00:18:04.183 region:rollup2
OF THAT SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:04.750 region:rollup2
GRADUATED IF YOU WILL FROM

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:06.719 region:rollup2
EIGHTH GRADE COMMENCE FROM

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.955 region:rollup2
EIGHTH GRADE. ARM AND THEN THE

00:18:06.719 --> 00:18:10.957 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WILL CEASE TO EXIST SO

00:18:08.955 --> 00:18:12.658 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ON THE EDGE OF NEEDING

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:14.694 region:rollup2
A STATE ALONE EMERGENCY

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:15.995 region:rollup2
PREPARATION THAT'S NOT THE PLAN.

00:18:14.694 --> 00:18:17.396 region:rollup2
IS WOULD BE THE CASE WHERE THAT

00:18:15.995 --> 00:18:18.998 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL WOULD CLOSE THE

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:21.067 region:rollup2
DISTRICT WOULD CEASE TO EXIST

00:18:18.998 --> 00:18:22.568 region:rollup2
AND IN NEIGHBORING DISTRICT VAN

00:18:21.067 --> 00:18:25.338 region:rollup2
WOULD CHANGE ITS BOUNDARIES AND

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:26.505 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO SERVE WHAT WOULD BE THE

00:18:25.338 --> 00:18:27.540 region:rollup2
REMAINING FIVE STUDENTS.

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:29.542 region:rollup2
ON THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AT

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:30.743 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL.

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:32.812 region:rollup2

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:57.903 region:rollup2
NUMBER QUALIFY DISTRICTS IS DOWN

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.238 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY FOUR.

00:18:57.903 --> 00:19:01.040 region:rollup2
THERE WERE FORTY ONE A YEAR

00:18:59.238 --> 00:19:02.408 region:rollup2
EARLIER AND AS I JUST MENTIONED

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.976 region:rollup2
JUST FORTY TWO A COUPLE MONTHS

00:19:02.408 --> 00:19:05.411 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

00:19:03.976 --> 00:19:07.279 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY OFFICES A NEW SHOW

00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:09.081 region:rollup2
REVIEW INDICATE THAT THERE ARE

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:10.916 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE POSITIVES THAT ARE

00:19:09.081 --> 00:19:12.318 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO BE DOWNGRADED TO

00:19:10.916 --> 00:19:14.787 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED SO WE MAY SEE THAT

00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:16.155 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOUR GROW. A LITTLE BIT.

00:19:14.787 --> 00:19:17.490 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NOTEWORTHY HERE'S

00:19:16.155 --> 00:19:20.059 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE CHANGE FROM FIRST

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:21.994 region:rollup2
AN ARM TO SECOND IN A ROOM AND.

00:19:20.059 --> 00:19:23.429 region:rollup2
AND THEM THE MAJOR CHANGE IN

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:23.863 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WOULD OCCUR AT THAT

00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:26.399 region:rollup2
POINT WOULD BE THE

00:19:23.863 --> 00:19:28.334 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION'S JANUARY BUDGET

00:19:26.399 --> 00:19:30.202 region:rollup2

HAS MORE FAVORABLE TERMS IN IT

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.373 region:rollup2
THAN DISTRICTS WERE EXPECTING

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:35.975 region:rollup2
JUST SIX MONTHS AGO OR EVEN A

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:39.211 region:rollup2
MONTH EARLIER. FOR THAT THREE

00:19:35.975 --> 00:19:40.513 region:rollup2
YEAR WINDOW. AND THEREFORE.

00:19:39.211 --> 00:19:42.915 region:rollup2
MANY MORE DISTRICTS OF OR

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:45.384 region:rollup2

AT GREAT RISK IS KLAMATH

SIGNIFICANT SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:17.549 region:rollup2
IT.

00:25:15.714 --> 00:25:19.485 region:rollup2
FOR AND IS BEEN RECEIVING

FROM THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD.

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:23.389 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE DISTRICT HAS NOT

THESE PROJECTS IN THE FUNDING

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:31.196 region:rollup2
EVEN AT HARDSHIP BUT HUNDRED

00:25:29.628 --> 00:25:32.398 region:rollup2
PERCENT. IS NOT GOING TO BE

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:35.100 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT.

00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:37.269 region:rollup2
TO COVER THE SCOPE THAT THE

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.771 region:rollup2
DISTRICT SET FORTH.

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:39.972 region:rollup2
THIS OBVIOUSLY EXPOSES THE

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.640 region:rollup2
DISTRICT TO SIGNIFICANT

00:25:39.972 --> 00:25:43.042 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL RISK AND CASH FLOW

ON TO ASSIST THE DISTRICT AND

00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:53.385 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ANALYSIS AND COUNCIL WE

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:54.720 region:rollup2
THINK THAT PROCESS ACTUALLY IS

00:25:53.385 --> 00:25:56.655 region:rollup2
GOING VERY WELL.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.890 region:rollup2
.

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:59.758 region:rollup2
OUR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY STILL

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.760 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THEY HAVE

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:11.303 region:rollup2
POINT.

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:11.670 region:rollup2
WHERE ON THE COUNTY WILL

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:13.005 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY END UP?

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.706 region:rollup2
?

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:16.141 region:rollup2
IT AGREEING OR NOT IT SECOND

00:26:14.706 --> 00:26:17.676 region:rollup2
INTERMITTENTLY THAT THE DISTRICT

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:18.877 region:rollup2
IS QUALIFIED.

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.813 region:rollup2
BASED ON RECENT CASH FOR

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:21.914 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCES THE DISTRICT MAY NOT

00:26:20.813 --> 00:26:23.215 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO MEET ITS CASH

00:26:21.914 --> 00:26:26.118 region:rollup2
OBLIGATIONS WITHOUT SOME

00:26:23.215 --> 00:26:26.718 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIVE ACTION.

00:26:26.118 --> 00:26:28.287 region:rollup2
AND SO WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR

00:26:26.718 --> 00:26:29.588 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:30.489 region:rollup2
THE THIRD DISTRICT I WANT TO

00:26:29.588 --> 00:26:32.357 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT.

WE DID PROVIDE AN INTERIM

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:50.903 region:rollup2
COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

00:27:47.399 --> 00:27:52.437 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT

00:27:50.903 --> 00:27:54.339 region:rollup2
OAKLAND ABOUT THEIR STABILITY ON

00:27:52.437 --> 00:27:54.907 region:rollup2
FISCALLY.

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:57.609 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

00:27:54.907 --> 00:27:59.178 region:rollup2
IN THE MIDST OF CHANGING

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:00.546 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP IN THEIR BUSINESS

00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:01.847 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS.

00:28:00.546 --> 00:28:04.650 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S A POSITIVE THING.

00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:06.251 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AT THIS POINT IN TIME

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:07.786 region:rollup2
WE CONTINUE TO WORK THERE

00:28:06.251 --> 00:28:10.155 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO PULL TOGETHER

00:28:07.786 --> 00:28:12.291 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL DATA. ON TRYING TO

00:28:10.155 --> 00:28:13.959 region:rollup2
BUILD OUR CONFIDENCE LEVEL ON IN

00:28:12.291 --> 00:28:15.928 region:rollup2
THEIR ACTUAL LOCAL MEMBERS.

00:28:13.959 --> 00:28:17.396 region:rollup2
AND WHAT HOW THEY ARE LEADING

00:28:15.928 --> 00:28:19.264 region:rollup2
AND MANAGING TO THOSE NUMBERS

00:28:17.396 --> 00:28:21.433 region:rollup2
WE'VE FOUND GAPS IN THE NUMBERS

00:28:19.264 --> 00:28:22.000 region:rollup2
OF WHAT. THEY THOUGHT THINGS

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:23.569 region:rollup2
WERE COMPARED TO WHAT THEY

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.237 region:rollup2
REALLY ARE. ALMOND SO WHERE

00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:26.505 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTING THOSE FOR THEM SO

00:28:25.237 --> 00:28:27.539 region:rollup2
THAT THEY CAN ADJUST ALONG THE

00:28:26.505 --> 00:28:29.408 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:30.909 region:rollup2
.

00:28:29.408 --> 00:28:32.811 region:rollup2
WHILE WE'VE NOT COMPLETED OUR

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.879 region:rollup2
HOUSES ARE PLANNER CONCLUSION IS

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:35.480 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICT DOES HAVE

00:28:33.879 --> 00:28:37.049 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT CASH.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.584 region:rollup2
ON RESOURCES FOR THE CURRENT

00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.251 region:rollup2
YEAR THROUGH JUNE.

00:28:38.584 --> 00:28:41.219 region:rollup2
BUT IS.

00:28:39.251 --> 00:28:43.422 region:rollup2
.

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:45.691 region:rollup2
IN FISCAL DISTRESS AND MUST TAKE

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:47.426 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT CORRECTIVE ACTION TO

00:28:45.691 --> 00:28:48.994 region:rollup2
STABILIZE ITS FUND BALANCE.

00:28:47.426 --> 00:28:51.129 region:rollup2
AND CASH FLOW FOR SUBSEQUENT

00:28:48.994 --> 00:28:53.065 region:rollup2
YEARS WHEN WE ENTERED THIS.

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:53.966 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY WE WERE ACTUALLY

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:55.200 region:rollup2
CONCERNED THAT THERE WERE

00:28:53.966 --> 00:28:57.135 region:rollup2
QUICKLY RUNNING OUT OF CASH

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.704 region:rollup2
WHICH OBVIOUSLY TRIGGERS

00:28:57.135 --> 00:29:00.172 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE STATE. EMERGENCY

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:01.707 region:rollup2
PORTION MATT HOWEVER THIS WOULD

00:29:00.172 --> 00:29:03.041 region:rollup2
BE VERY UNCHARTED WATERS WHERE

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:04.876 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE AN EXISTING EMERGENCY

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:07.946 region:rollup2
PORTION.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:10.115 region:rollup2
AND SO WE BELIEVE THE DISTRICT

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:10.916 region:rollup2
CAST SUFFICIENT CASH RESOURCES

00:29:10.115 --> 00:29:12.317 region:rollup2
BY.

00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:13.785 region:rollup2
WE'VE DISCOVERED A NUMBER OF

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:14.653 region:rollup2
THINGS WHICH ARE ADVERSE TO

00:29:13.785 --> 00:29:16.755 region:rollup2
THEIR FUND BALANCE.

00:29:14.653 --> 00:29:17.656 region:rollup2
AND AND THOSE ARE THINGS WE CAN

00:29:16.755 --> 00:29:18.857 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH OVER TIME OBVIOUSLY

00:29:17.656 --> 00:29:20.759 region:rollup2
CASH

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:22.160 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES NOTS IS AN IMMEDIATE

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.061 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND SO FROM THAT

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.596 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT.

00:29:23.061 --> 00:29:26.632 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICTS IN BETTER SHAPE

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:27.733 region:rollup2
THAN WE THOUGHT IN OTHER

00:29:26.632 --> 00:29:28.200 region:rollup2
RESPECTS IS ABOUT ONE THE

00:29:27.733 --> 00:29:30.302 region:rollup2
DISTRICT.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.870 region:rollup2
IS STRUGGLING A BIT.

00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:33.005 region:rollup2
SOLVENCY TRENDS I'M JUST TO

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:34.439 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON A COUPLE THINGS IN THE

00:29:33.005 --> 00:29:35.540 region:rollup2
OUTLINE.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:38.143 region:rollup2
ELEAZAR.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.244 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO FACE COST PRESSURES

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.780 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PENSIONS AND SPECIAL

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:44.283 region:rollup2
EDUCATION ALL TOPICS THAT THIS

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.752 region:rollup2
BODY IS IS CLEARLY AWARE OF.

00:29:44.283 --> 00:29:49.087 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THERE.

00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:50.789 region:rollup2
JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL HAS OF

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:52.157 region:rollup2
RT MENTION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.692 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO MITIGATE THESE

00:29:52.157 --> 00:29:55.427 region:rollup2
PRESSURES.

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:57.195 region:rollup2
I'M ONE TIME FUNDING PROVIDES AN

00:29:55.427 --> 00:29:59.498 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO MITIGATE KNOWN

00:29:57.195 --> 00:30:02.167 region:rollup2
ADVERSE TRENDS IN DISTRICTS IN

00:29:59.498 --> 00:30:03.468 region:rollup2
THEIR PLANS. AND SO WHILE I'M

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.570 region:rollup2
ALL MONEY IS GOOD MONEY.

KNOW IT.

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:04.629 region:rollup2
THEN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:05.897 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTIES THAT FOLLOW THAT

00:36:04.629 --> 00:36:07.966 region:rollup2
FULL IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT WE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:09.968 region:rollup2
KNOW CURRENT LAW SAYS THE.

REVENUES.

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:26.051 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE.

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:27.285 region:rollup2
MORE QUALIFIED LESS QUALIFIED

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:29.020 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:36:27.285 --> 00:36:30.889 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO NEGATIVE THERE

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:32.323 region:rollup2
ARE SO MANY MORE ISSUES AT HAND

00:36:30.889 --> 00:36:33.258 region:rollup2
IN A DISTRICT THAT CERTIFIED

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:34.826 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE.

00:36:33.258 --> 00:36:36.594 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CLEARLY GOING TO BE

00:36:34.826 --> 00:36:38.630 region:rollup2

THE DETERMINATION MAY BE A

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:46.304 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE. DOLLAR NUMBER BUT

00:36:44.969 --> 00:36:47.806 region:rollup2
BUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:49.707 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE AND SO IF YOU LOOK OVER

00:36:47.806 --> 00:36:50.709 region:rollup2
TIME NAY NUMBER NEGATIVE

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.343 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ARE ACTUALLY FAIRLY

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:54.913 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT THERE ARE VERY LOW

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
NUMBER. ON IN PART BECAUSE AB

00:36:54.913 --> 00:36:58.316 region:rollup2
TWELVE UNDER PROCESS WORKS

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:00.218 region:rollup2
ON ANY IN PART BECAUSE IT'S NOT

LCF A FUNDING.

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:50.969 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST SINGLE IMPACT IN

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:51.769 region:rollup2
THAT CHANGE WOULD BE THAT YES

00:37:50.969 --> 00:37:52.771 region:rollup2
SIR ALRIGHT.

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:54.272 region:rollup2
PHAM BUT I ALSO NOTICED THAT.

.

00:37:54.272 --> 00:37:56.708 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:56.908 region:rollup2
MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT

EITHER AND NEGATIVE TERRITORY

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:02.580 region:rollup2
OR.

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:05.650 region:rollup2
OR.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:07.352 region:rollup2

AT RISK.

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:13.591 region:rollup2
.

00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:16.127 region:rollup2
THEY WERE.

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:17.362 region:rollup2
LARGELY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE A

00:38:16.127 --> 00:38:19.197 region:rollup2
HIGH ON DEPLETED STUDENT

00:38:17.362 --> 00:38:21.800 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

00:38:19.197 --> 00:38:24.135 region:rollup2
SO AND SO ON.

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.369 region:rollup2
WHILE THESE DISTRICTS ARE

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:26.070 region:rollup2
GETTING.

00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:28.640 region:rollup2
.

00:38:26.070 --> 00:38:29.941 region:rollup2
MORE DOLLARS UNDER THE LCF A

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.143 region:rollup2
FUNDING FORMULA.

00:38:29.941 --> 00:38:35.079 region:rollup2
THEY.

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:36.781 region:rollup2
THAT HAS NOT TRANSLATED INTO.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:39.384 region:rollup2
.

00:38:36.781 --> 00:38:41.319 region:rollup2
HEALTHY.

00:38:39.384 --> 00:38:44.088 region:rollup2
STABLE BUDGET SITUATIONS IS IS

00:38:41.319 --> 00:38:45.223 region:rollup2
THAT FAIR TO SAY.

00:38:44.088 --> 00:38:46.624 region:rollup2
AT LEAST FOR THESE OF THE

00:38:45.223 --> 00:38:48.193 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.493 region:rollup2
PS AND FOR THE DISTRICTS ARE

00:38:48.193 --> 00:38:54.232 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED.

00:38:48.493 --> 00:38:54.999 region:rollup2
.

00:38:54.232 --> 00:38:56.901 region:rollup2
SO WE GO BACK A LITTLE BIT IN

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:58.336 region:rollup2
HISTORY SINCE AB TWELVE HUNDRED

00:38:56.901 --> 00:39:00.605 region:rollup2
IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:02.106 region:rollup2
THEIR BEEN NINE DISTRICTS OF

00:39:00.605 --> 00:39:04.008 region:rollup2
NEED TO COME TO THE STATE FOR AN

00:39:02.106 --> 00:39:05.510 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY APPORTIONMENT.

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:07.111 region:rollup2
LEADING UP TO THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.547 region:rollup2
ADOPTION OF AB TWELVE UNDER.

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:10.114 region:rollup2
JUST IN THE I THINK THE DECADE

00:39:09.547 --> 00:39:11.850 region:rollup2
BEFORE THAT THERE WERE SOME

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:13.151 region:rollup2
TWENTY.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.086 region:rollup2
FIVE IF I REMEMBER THE NUMBER

00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.154 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW LOW TWENTIES.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:18.690 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:39:16.154 --> 00:39:20.091 region:rollup2
THAT IMPART SPEAKS TO THE

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.426 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:22.327 region:rollup2
THE WISDOM THEY HAD AT THAT TIME

00:39:21.426 --> 00:39:24.262 region:rollup2
PUT IN PLACE.

00:39:22.327 --> 00:39:26.931 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS.

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:27.899 region:rollup2
.

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.500 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICTS THAT I'VE

00:39:27.899 --> 00:39:33.338 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED IN AND LET ME SAY OF

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:33.338 region:rollup2
THE NINE THIS IS WHERE I WAS

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:37.075 region:rollup2
PROCESS HERE THAN NINE THAT

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.776 region:rollup2
NEEDED A STATE APPORTIONMENT IT

00:39:37.075 --> 00:39:40.678 region:rollup2
WAS ULTIMATELY CASH

00:39:38.776 --> 00:39:43.081 region:rollup2
THE LACK OF CASH WHAT WE CALL

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:44.816 region:rollup2
CASH INSOLVENCY THAT PUSHED HIM

00:39:43.081 --> 00:39:45.950 region:rollup2
OVER THE LINE ON A GIVEN DAY.

00:39:44.816 --> 00:39:46.918 region:rollup2
WHY WE NEEDED TO COME TO A

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.152 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE FOR AN EMERGENCY

00:39:46.918 --> 00:39:50.121 region:rollup2
APPORTIONMENT?

00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:51.789 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WERE YEARS AND YEARS

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:53.858 region:rollup2
AND YEARS OF LEADERSHIP AND

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:56.194 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT PREDATE

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:58.429 region:rollup2
THAT SINGLE EVENT.

00:39:56.194 --> 00:40:01.399 region:rollup2
THE DISTRICTS I HIGHLIGHTED HERE

00:39:58.429 --> 00:40:02.500 region:rollup2
HAVE LEADERSHIP HAD IN THE NEAR

00:40:01.399 --> 00:40:04.802 region:rollup2
TERM.

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:06.304 region:rollup2
RECENT PASS LEADERSHIP AND

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:08.673 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE ISSUES.

00:40:06.304 --> 00:40:10.108 region:rollup2
WHICH WHILE THERE WHY THEY'RE

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:12.677 region:rollup2
ON THE LIST.

00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:14.545 region:rollup2
AND SO. I WOULDN'T.

00:40:12.677 --> 00:40:15.446 region:rollup2
I'D BE CAREFUL WITH THE ONES WE

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:17.148 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTED TO SAY.

00:40:15.446 --> 00:40:20.718 region:rollup2
.

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:22.587 region:rollup2
THAT DESPITE AND EXPANSION OF

00:40:20.718 --> 00:40:24.455 region:rollup2
OF REVENUES DURING THE ECONOMIC

00:40:22.587 --> 00:40:25.623 region:rollup2
RECOVERY AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:27.659 region:rollup2
OF ALL CFF.

00:40:25.623 --> 00:40:30.261 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:40:27.659 --> 00:40:32.363 region:rollup2
THAT. THAT WAS A POSITIVE

00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:33.898 region:rollup2
EVENT OBVIOUSLY FOR EVERYBODY.

00:40:32.363 --> 00:40:36.167 region:rollup2
AND FOR THEM.

00:40:33.898 --> 00:40:37.568 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP AND

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:39.203 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE IN THE RIGHT FOCUS

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:40.672 region:rollup2
SHOULD THE EL CAP PROCESS ON

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:42.740 region:rollup2
STUDENT NEEDS.

00:40:40.672 --> 00:40:44.409 region:rollup2
AND SO ON ISN'T ALL IN ALL THOSE

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:45.910 region:rollup2
ELEMENTS ARE NOT IN PLACE.

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:48.313 region:rollup2
THEN EXPENDITURES ARE GOING TO

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.647 region:rollup2
BE A LINE TO THE RIGHT THINGS.

00:40:48.313 --> 00:40:51.416 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:40:49.647 --> 00:40:52.984 region:rollup2
IN THE ONE CASE.

00:40:51.416 --> 00:40:54.719 region:rollup2
CLIMATE TRINITY IT'S A

00:40:52.984 --> 00:40:56.354 region:rollup2
FACILITIES ISSUE NOT OBJECT NOT

00:40:54.719 --> 00:40:57.622 region:rollup2
OF INSTRUCTIONAL OPERATIONAL

00:40:56.354 --> 00:40:58.756 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:40:57.622 --> 00:41:00.291 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF YOU SOMEBODY

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:02.026 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD SOME BREAKDOWN IN

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:03.761 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:06.931 region:rollup2
IN THE CASE OF OAKLAND WE HAVE A

00:41:03.761 --> 00:41:08.666 region:rollup2
NEW LEADER THERE SINCE JULY.

00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:10.368 region:rollup2
DOING GREAT WORK.

00:41:08.666 --> 00:41:11.636 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE HAD SOME

00:41:10.368 --> 00:41:13.004 region:rollup2
INCONSISTENCIES IN OAKLAND OVER

00:41:11.636 --> 00:41:14.872 region:rollup2
THE LAST

00:41:13.004 --> 00:41:16.741 region:rollup2
DECADE FROM A LEADERSHIP AND

00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:18.543 region:rollup2
GOVERNANCE STANDPOINT. AND ALL

00:41:16.741 --> 00:41:20.211 region:rollup2
OF THAT HAS IS A LEAD TO THEIR

00:41:18.543 --> 00:41:22.113 region:rollup2
CURRENT SITUATION.

00:41:20.211 --> 00:41:24.615 region:rollup2
MY ONLY IN RESPONDING TO SERVE

00:41:22.113 --> 00:41:26.084 region:rollup2
MY MY ONLY POINT REALLY IS THAT

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:26.584 region:rollup2
WHILE EACH OF THESE DISTRICTS

00:41:26.084 --> 00:41:28.386 region:rollup2
WITH HIGH IN DUPLICATED

00:41:26.584 --> 00:41:29.220 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS.

00:41:28.386 --> 00:41:31.789 region:rollup2
HAVE RECEIVED.

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:34.359 region:rollup2
LARGER PER DOLLAR.

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:35.693 region:rollup2
HOUND ALLOCATIONS APARTMENTS IF

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:38.329 region:rollup2
YOU WILL.

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:40.031 region:rollup2
TOM THEIR ISSUES ARE RELATED TO

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:42.867 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR ISSUES ARE REALLY.

00:41:40.031 --> 00:41:44.469 region:rollup2
RELATED TO A BIGGER A BIGGER

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:46.170 region:rollup2
PICTURE HERE WHO SPECIFICALLY

00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:48.373 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP IN CONGRESS.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.141 region:rollup2
OKAY AND UP.

00:41:48.373 --> 00:41:52.310 region:rollup2
SO I WAS ENCOURAGED TO SEE THAT.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:54.746 region:rollup2
AYE AYE REPRESENT.

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:56.514 region:rollup2
A PORTION OF LOS ANGELES

00:41:54.746 --> 00:41:59.217 region:rollup2
UNIFIED AND AND IT APPEARS THAT

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:59.751 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE MOVED OFF THE QUALIFY

00:41:59.217 --> 00:42:00.451 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION LIST IS THAT

00:41:59.751 --> 00:42:03.354 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:06.457 region:rollup2
.

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:07.725 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW SIR LA IS A UNIQUE

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.060 region:rollup2
HOUSE UNIQUE.

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:10.695 region:rollup2
TWO ITS OWN RIGHT.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.630 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT ON THE

00:42:10.695 --> 00:42:13.798 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED LISTS THEY ARE WORKING

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:15.333 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW.

00:42:13.798 --> 00:42:16.167 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.168 region:rollup2
YEARS OF ISSUES.

00:42:16.167 --> 00:42:20.338 region:rollup2
.

00:42:17.168 --> 00:42:21.239 region:rollup2
.

00:42:20.338 --> 00:42:22.573 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE COUNTY

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:24.008 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY LEAVES THEM IN THEIR

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.443 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CURRENT REVIEW OF

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.711 region:rollup2
SECOND INTERIM.

00:42:25.443 --> 00:42:29.046 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE.

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:32.250 region:rollup2
ATTACK UNIQUE PROBABLY FROM

00:42:29.046 --> 00:42:33.084 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE IN IN. THE RISK

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.685 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT THAT'S DONE.

00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:36.487 region:rollup2
ON.

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:37.855 region:rollup2
SO THEY GET THEIR OWN RISK

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:38.823 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT THEY DON'T GET THEIR

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:39.824 region:rollup2
OWN RISK ASSESSMENT WE HAVE

00:42:38.823 --> 00:42:40.958 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND CRITERIA THEIR

00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:42.794 region:rollup2
PLIGHT EVERYWHERE.

00:42:40.958 --> 00:42:44.495 region:rollup2
WHAT IS?

00:42:42.794 --> 00:42:45.830 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S BOTH IF I CAN.

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:47.432 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED THIS WAY THERE'S BOTH

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.900 region:rollup2
A SCIENCE AND AN ART TO THE AB

00:42:47.432 --> 00:42:50.501 region:rollup2
TWELVE UNDER PROCESS THE SCIENCE

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:51.702 region:rollup2
IN PART IS CONSISTENT.

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:53.805 region:rollup2
STANDARDS AND CRITERIA THEY'RE

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:56.707 region:rollup2
APPLIED BUT YOU YOU GO TO A

00:42:53.805 --> 00:42:58.209 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LEVEL AND DEPTH.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:43:00.077 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE WHEN I COUNTIES

00:42:58.209 --> 00:43:01.379 region:rollup2
RECESS US ASSESSMENT OF A GIVEN

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.747 region:rollup2
DISTRICT THAT THERE'S A HIGHER

00:43:01.379 --> 00:43:04.916 region:rollup2
RISK.

00:43:02.747 --> 00:43:05.817 region:rollup2
SO TO NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS

00:43:04.916 --> 00:43:07.051 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE THE EXACT SAME

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:08.486 region:rollup2
STUDENT POPULATION EXACTS IN

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:10.855 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:43:08.486 --> 00:43:12.123 region:rollup2
ONE MAY HAVE SOME HIGHER RISKS

00:43:10.855 --> 00:43:13.825 region:rollup2
THAN THE OTHER.

00:43:12.123 --> 00:43:15.259 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HISTORY COULD BE

00:43:13.825 --> 00:43:16.594 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP HISTORY COULD BE

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:18.596 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT'S HISTORY COULD BE.

00:43:16.594 --> 00:43:20.731 region:rollup2
ARMED A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:21.199 region:rollup2
COULD BE FACILITY CHALLENGES IN

00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:22.366 region:rollup2
THE CONDITIONS OF THE

00:43:21.199 --> 00:43:25.002 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:43:22.366 --> 00:43:25.970 region:rollup2
AND SO THE DEPTH AT WHICH A

00:43:25.002 --> 00:43:27.405 region:rollup2
COUNTY OFFICE DOES THAT IS

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:29.707 region:rollup2
UNIQUE.

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:31.175 region:rollup2
AND IT AND SHOULD BE.

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:32.743 region:rollup2
VERY CANDIDLY.

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:34.745 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE SAME

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:35.780 region:rollup2
SET OF CRITERIA AND STANDARDS

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:36.481 region:rollup2
THAT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:39.283 region:rollup2
FALL.

00:43:36.481 --> 00:43:40.852 region:rollup2
DURING.

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.053 region:rollup2
BUT MY MY POINT ABOUT OLLIE IS

00:43:40.852 --> 00:43:43.721 region:rollup2
THE ARE UNIQUE THEY ARE NOT

00:43:42.053 --> 00:43:45.056 region:rollup2
COMPARABLE.

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.256 region:rollup2
TO ANYBODY ELSE IN THE STATE

00:43:45.056 --> 00:43:46.491 region:rollup2
FROM.

00:43:45.256 --> 00:43:48.960 region:rollup2
.

00:43:46.491 --> 00:43:51.762 region:rollup2
JUST COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.697 region:rollup2
JUST PURELY BASED ON SIZE

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:55.099 region:rollup2
AND COMPLEXITY OF THE DISTRICT.

00:43:52.697 --> 00:43:56.334 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:59.504 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I'VE

00:43:56.334 --> 00:44:01.772 region:rollup2
BEEN HEARING OF BOTH FROM LARGE.

00:43:59.504 --> 00:44:02.073 region:rollup2
URBAN DISTRICTS LIKE LA UNIFIED

00:44:01.772 --> 00:44:03.674 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS.

00:44:02.073 --> 00:44:05.943 region:rollup2
.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:06.577 region:rollup2
SMALLER DISTRICTS IS.

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:08.713 region:rollup2
AND THAT.

00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:10.481 region:rollup2
INDEED THE BASE GRAND PORTION

00:44:08.713 --> 00:44:11.782 region:rollup2
OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:13.217 region:rollup2
FORMULA HAS HAS BEEN.

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:15.386 region:rollup2
.

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:17.822 region:rollup2
INADEQUATE ESPECIALLY IN

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:19.957 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THE. AT THE TO.

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:22.059 region:rollup2
BIGGEST DRIVERS OF COST

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:23.294 region:rollup2
INCREASES PENSION COSTS AND

00:44:22.059 --> 00:44:25.496 region:rollup2
SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS.

00:44:23.294 --> 00:44:27.598 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:44:25.496 --> 00:44:28.132 region:rollup2
PRIOR TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

00:44:27.598 --> 00:44:30.801 region:rollup2
FULL.

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:32.670 region:rollup2
AN EXPEDITED FUNDING OF LC FFI

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:35.373 region:rollup2
IT WAS HEARING.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.842 region:rollup2
THIS WITH MORE URGENCY.

00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:39.744 region:rollup2
ARM.

00:44:37.842 --> 00:44:42.880 region:rollup2
IT INDEED DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:44:39.744 --> 00:44:44.415 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS AS TO WHETHER YOU.

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.950 region:rollup2
I MEAN WILL WE ALL KNOW THAT

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:48.219 region:rollup2
WE'RE DUE FOR A.

00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:50.321 region:rollup2
RECESSION AT SOME POINT AND THAT

00:44:48.219 --> 00:44:52.990 region:rollup2
WE ARE READY.

00:44:50.321 --> 00:44:53.891 region:rollup2
I HAD BENEFITING FROM.

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:55.493 region:rollup2
THE LONGEST.

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:57.595 region:rollup2
POST WAR.

00:44:55.493 --> 00:44:59.597 region:rollup2
EXPANSION AND IN THAT WERE DUE

00:44:57.595 --> 00:45:01.499 region:rollup2
FOR A RECESSION.

00:44:59.597 --> 00:45:02.433 region:rollup2
I ES DE YUBA. DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:45:01.499 --> 00:45:03.935 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF.

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:05.403 region:rollup2
.

00:45:03.935 --> 00:45:06.604 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTED TREND.

00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:08.773 region:rollup2
.

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:10.741 region:rollup2
IN.

00:45:08.773 --> 00:45:12.910 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE ARE. CERTIFICATIONS

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:13.811 region:rollup2
RELATIVE TO THIS ISSUE OF THE

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:15.713 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF THE

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:17.582 region:rollup2
BASS GRANT.

00:45:15.713 --> 00:45:19.850 region:rollup2
SO I THINK IT'S BEST THAT I

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:21.485 region:rollup2
LEAVE IT A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:23.187 region:rollup2
ADEQUACY OR INADEQUACY OF THE

00:45:21.485 --> 00:45:23.754 region:rollup2
BASS GRANT TO MY COLLEAGUES IN

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:25.423 region:rollup2
FINANCING ELIO I THINK THEY

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:26.958 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:45:25.423 --> 00:45:28.292 region:rollup2
A CONVERSATION WITH THEM OVER

00:45:26.958 --> 00:45:30.261 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE.

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:31.762 region:rollup2
FAR MORE PRODUCTIVE.

00:45:30.261 --> 00:45:34.131 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO TREND THOUGH.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:34.966 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WHEN DISTRICTS ARE

00:45:34.131 --> 00:45:36.567 region:rollup2
PREPARING THEIR MULTI YOUR

00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:37.435 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS THIS

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:39.370 region:rollup2
SPRING WHICH WOULD INCLUDE.

00:45:37.435 --> 00:45:40.738 region:rollup2
NEXT.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:42.640 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET YEAR PLUS TWO

00:45:40.738 --> 00:45:45.209 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL YEARS THERE'S NO

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:47.511 region:rollup2
DOUBT THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:49.080 region:rollup2
TREND DOWNWARD IN YEAR OVER YEAR

00:45:47.511 --> 00:45:51.115 region:rollup2
REVENUE GROWTH. WHILE

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.516 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN SEVERAL

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:54.919 region:rollup2
CRITICAL AREAS IS TRENDING

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:57.288 region:rollup2
UPWARD. YOU MENTION AND TWO OF

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:59.056 region:rollup2
THOSE PURGED TERROR SPECIAL AT

00:45:57.288 --> 00:46:00.858 region:rollup2
THREE OF THOSE REALLY PENSIONS

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:02.393 region:rollup2
AND SPECIAL ED. OR TWO ON THOSE

00:46:00.858 --> 00:46:03.861 region:rollup2
ARE CLEARLY.

00:46:02.393 --> 00:46:05.997 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW.

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:07.632 region:rollup2
ARE INCREASING.

00:46:05.997 --> 00:46:09.333 region:rollup2
.

00:46:07.632 --> 00:46:11.135 region:rollup2
WHILE REVENUE YEAR OVER YEAR

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:12.703 region:rollup2
REVENUES NOT NEGATIVE YEAR OVER

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:15.306 region:rollup2
YEAR REVENUE IN THE OUT YEARS AS

00:46:12.703 --> 00:46:17.775 region:rollup2
MUCH FLATTER. LITTLE SOFTER AND

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:19.577 region:rollup2
SO THAT WILL DEFINITELY HAVE AN

00:46:17.775 --> 00:46:21.278 region:rollup2
IMPACT GOING FORWARD ON THE

00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:22.546 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF QUALIFIED DISTRICTS I

00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.949 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT WILL IMPACT THE

00:46:22.546 --> 00:46:26.284 region:rollup2
NUMBER NEGATIVE AGAIN. BUT

00:46:24.949 --> 00:46:27.652 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY QUALIFIED IT WILL.

00:46:26.284 --> 00:46:29.587 region:rollup2
.

00:46:27.652 --> 00:46:31.322 region:rollup2
THE SAME DISTRICTS HAVE RECEIVED

00:46:29.587 --> 00:46:33.391 region:rollup2
A LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDING.

00:46:31.322 --> 00:46:36.494 region:rollup2
SIX PLUS BILLION OVER THE LAST

00:46:33.391 --> 00:46:38.062 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS HOW THEY'VE USE THAT.

00:46:36.494 --> 00:46:40.197 region:rollup2
HAVE THEY USED IN THAT TO

00:46:38.062 --> 00:46:42.400 region:rollup2
MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE LONGER

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:44.568 region:rollup2
TERM OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.170 region:rollup2
PENSIONS AND SO ON. ALSO AS PART

00:46:44.568 --> 00:46:48.539 region:rollup2
OF THAT EQUATION HAS TO BE

00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:49.407 region:rollup2
LOOKED OUT SETS UP IT'S A BIGGER

00:46:48.539 --> 00:46:51.409 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAN JUST THE BASE

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:53.244 region:rollup2
GRANT.

00:46:51.409 --> 00:46:55.179 region:rollup2
IT'S A BIGGER ANALYSIS BUT IT'S

00:46:53.244 --> 00:46:56.380 region:rollup2
FAIR TO SAY THAT.

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:58.749 region:rollup2
WE CAN REASONABLY EXPECT.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:47:01.452 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE INCREASING TREND

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:02.653 region:rollup2
AND QUALIFIED CERTIFICATIONS.

00:47:01.452 --> 00:47:04.455 region:rollup2
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BASED ON

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:05.856 region:rollup2
CURRENT FORECAST YES AND IT

00:47:04.455 --> 00:47:06.424 region:rollup2
WON'T TAKE AS THE LA O. IN

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.626 region:rollup2
FINANCE BOTH HAVE. SPOKEN TO

00:47:06.424 --> 00:47:08.793 region:rollup2
HIM.

00:47:08.626 --> 00:47:10.227 region:rollup2
IN.

00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:11.262 region:rollup2
.

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:13.631 region:rollup2
IT WON'T TAKE MUCH OF A

00:47:11.262 --> 00:47:15.566 region:rollup2
RECESSION.

00:47:13.631 --> 00:47:17.268 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL OUR OUR ADVERSE

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:18.836 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON STATE REVENUES TO.

00:47:17.268 --> 00:47:20.838 region:rollup2
.

00:47:18.836 --> 00:47:22.406 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT.

00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:23.441 region:rollup2
SAME INFLUENCE ON THAT TREND.

00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:27.378 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:47:23.441 --> 00:47:29.013 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:47:27.378 --> 00:47:31.248 region:rollup2
THINK I WANTED TO ASK THEM SOME.

00:47:29.013 --> 00:47:32.083 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS SYSTEM I KNOW EVERY

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.585 region:rollup2
DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT AND THEIR

00:47:32.083 --> 00:47:37.421 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ARE UNIQUE.

00:47:34.585 --> 00:47:38.289 region:rollup2
HOW THEY GOT HERE BUT AFTER

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:40.124 region:rollup2
DESPITE INTERESTING THAT YOU

00:47:38.289 --> 00:47:40.424 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN IS MY FOURTH

00:47:40.124 --> 00:47:42.693 region:rollup2
YEAR HERE?

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:43.861 region:rollup2
AND.

00:47:42.693 --> 00:47:45.863 region:rollup2
I THINK THE LAST FIVE OR SIX

00:47:43.861 --> 00:47:46.864 region:rollup2
YEARS WE'VE HAD AT. UPTAKE IN

00:47:45.863 --> 00:47:47.998 region:rollup2
PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:50.067 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE DOING BETTER AND SO

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:52.837 region:rollup2
FORTH.

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:55.005 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU SAW THAT THE NUMBER

00:47:52.837 --> 00:47:57.775 region:rollup2
OF THE OF THE THAT DID.

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:59.643 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE M..

00:47:57.775 --> 00:48:01.679 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEM AREA WE'RE GOING

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:03.114 region:rollup2
DOWN AS WE START PUTTING MORE

00:48:01.679 --> 00:48:05.282 region:rollup2
MONEY OUT THE DOOR TO OUR

00:48:03.114 --> 00:48:06.617 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND THEN THE LAST FEW

00:48:05.282 --> 00:48:08.119 region:rollup2
YEARS. THEY'VE.

00:48:06.617 --> 00:48:10.554 region:rollup2
GOT UPGRADED NEXT YEAR YOU

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:13.090 region:rollup2
PROJECTED TO GO BACK DOWN.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:15.226 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU? HOW DO YOU RESPOND

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.660 region:rollup2
TO THAT AND THIS SEEMS

00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:18.562 region:rollup2
COUNTERINTUITIVE?

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.030 region:rollup2
IT DOES I THINK IT'S.

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:21.565 region:rollup2
SO FIRST REMEMBER THAT THESE

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:23.601 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS ARE DONE ON THAT IN

00:48:21.565 --> 00:48:25.236 region:rollup2
A THREE YEAR WINDOW.

00:48:23.601 --> 00:48:27.037 region:rollup2
SO FOR EACH OF THE POINTS THAT

00:48:25.236 --> 00:48:29.774 region:rollup2
YOU'RE REFERRING TO SIXTEEN

00:48:27.037 --> 00:48:31.075 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN AND AND SO ON. YOU'RE

00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:32.843 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT CURRENT YEAR

00:48:31.075 --> 00:48:35.079 region:rollup2
PLUS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS IN

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:36.647 region:rollup2
THAT EVALUATION AND SO WITHIN

00:48:35.079 --> 00:48:38.249 region:rollup2
THAT WINDOW.

00:48:36.647 --> 00:48:39.450 region:rollup2
OF THREE YEARS AND AND THE

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:40.351 region:rollup2
REASON YOU SEE THE TREND THAT

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.753 region:rollup2
YOUR YOUR.

00:48:40.351 --> 00:48:44.989 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO MISTER CHAIR IS.

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:46.223 region:rollup2
IS ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SHORT

00:48:44.989 --> 00:48:48.793 region:rollup2
PERIOD OF TIME.

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
BE GOES JUST BACK A YEAR TO THE

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:52.129 region:rollup2
FIRST ENORMOUS SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN

00:48:50.728 --> 00:48:55.065 region:rollup2
ONE WHICH UP FROM FOURTEEN TO

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:58.102 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE. THAT BEGAN TO.

00:48:55.065 --> 00:49:01.539 region:rollup2
LOOK AT WHAT WAS THEN EIGHTEEN

00:48:58.102 --> 00:49:03.808 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. NINETEEN TWENTY. ARE

00:49:01.539 --> 00:49:06.477 region:rollup2
WITH WHY WE WERE STILL ON TRACK

00:49:03.808 --> 00:49:08.979 region:rollup2
FOR A EIGHT YEAR IMPLEMENTATION

00:49:06.477 --> 00:49:10.381 region:rollup2
OF LCF HALF NOT AN ACCELERATED.

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:12.850 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

00:49:10.381 --> 00:49:14.351 region:rollup2
AND SO IN THOSE IN THOSE LATER

00:49:12.850 --> 00:49:16.754 region:rollup2
YEARS YEAR TWO ONE THREE IF I

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:18.088 region:rollup2
CAN REFER TO THEM THAT WAY.

00:49:16.754 --> 00:49:20.157 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:23.227 region:rollup2
TWENTY YOU SEE.

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:25.029 region:rollup2
COSTS RISING FASTER.

00:49:23.227 --> 00:49:26.530 region:rollup2
THEN YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE.

00:49:25.029 --> 00:49:27.498 region:rollup2
SO AGAIN EURO YOU'RE REVENUES

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.300 region:rollup2
POSITIVE GROWTH NOT NEGATIVE

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:31.502 region:rollup2
GROWTH.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.003 region:rollup2
HOWEVER THE COSTS

00:49:31.502 --> 00:49:35.472 region:rollup2
WERE RISING AT A HIGHER RATE.

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:36.941 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY.

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.275 region:rollup2
AS I WAS JUST ALLUDING TO

00:49:36.941 --> 00:49:40.477 region:rollup2
PENSIONS.

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:42.079 region:rollup2
SPECIAL ED.

00:49:40.477 --> 00:49:44.248 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:42.079 --> 00:49:45.716 region:rollup2
NOT REALLY HIGHER RATE BUT A

00:49:44.248 --> 00:49:47.284 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF ALL THIS WOULD BE

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.818 region:rollup2
STEP IN CALLING. ON SALARY

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:49.687 region:rollup2
SCHEDULES IF YOU TAKE JUST

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.788 region:rollup2
THOSE.

00:49:49.687 --> 00:49:52.156 region:rollup2
JUST THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF STIRS

00:49:50.788 --> 00:49:53.991 region:rollup2
PURRS.

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:54.592 region:rollup2
STEPPING COLUMN.

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:56.594 region:rollup2

AND SPECIAL ED AND SPECIAL IT'S

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:05.402 region:rollup2
GOING TO VARY WIDELY BY

DISTRICT.

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:08.272 region:rollup2
AHMED AL OR EXPLAIN THAT JUST A

00:50:06.904 --> 00:50:10.241 region:rollup2
SECOND YOU LOOK AT JUSTICE FOR

00:50:08.272 --> 00:50:12.042 region:rollup2
ELEMENT MOST DISTRICTS WOULD

00:50:10.241 --> 00:50:13.244 region:rollup2
DESCRIBE THOSE ELEMENTS AS

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:15.513 region:rollup2
SOMETHING NOT UNDER THEIR LOCAL

00:50:13.244 --> 00:50:17.515 region:rollup2
CONTROL.

00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:19.517 region:rollup2
RIGHT WHERE EVERYTHING ELSE IN

00:50:17.515 --> 00:50:21.385 region:rollup2
THERE BUDGET WORLD IS KIND OF

00:50:19.517 --> 00:50:23.153 region:rollup2
UNDER THEIR LOCAL CONTROL IS TO

00:50:21.385 --> 00:50:25.422 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND PROGRAM ACTS TO EXPAND

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:28.025 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHY. DO WE ADD TEN

LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD ON HAS THE

00:50:29.627 --> 00:50:34.064 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO DECIDE THAT. THE THE

00:50:31.729 --> 00:50:36.367 region:rollup2
PURSE RATES THE STIRS RATE

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:38.202 region:rollup2

GUY SET IN STONE NEGOTIATED IF

00:50:38.202 --> 00:50:43.040 region:rollup2
YOU WILL. DECADES AGO. AND THEN

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:44.742 region:rollup2
THE VERY BOND SPECIAL ED IS THIS

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.110 region:rollup2
IN YOUR OFTEN THEY WITH THIS A.

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:47.478 region:rollup2
B. SIX A TWO WHICH IS STATE

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:47.945 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN FUNDING FOR SPECIAL

00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:49.446 region:rollup2
ED. IS BASED ON TOTAL

00:50:47.945 --> 00:50:50.848 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT.

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:52.016 region:rollup2
TOTAL ENROLLMENT IN FIFTY

00:50:50.848 --> 00:50:54.051 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR DISTRICTS IS

00:50:52.016 --> 00:50:55.519 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DECLINING.

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:57.021 region:rollup2
BUT THERE SPECIAL ED POPULATIONS

00:50:55.519 --> 00:50:59.189 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY DECLINING AT THE

00:50:57.021 --> 00:51:00.457 region:rollup2
SAME RATE IN FACT IN MANY CASES

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:02.393 region:rollup2
IT'S INCREASING OR REMAINING

00:51:00.457 --> 00:51:03.427 region:rollup2
FLAT SO AS A PERCENTAGE OF

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:05.496 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IT'S ACTUALLY GOING

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:07.064 region:rollup2
UP. IT'S BEEN BETWEEN TEN AND

00:51:05.496 --> 00:51:08.766 region:rollup2
ELEVEN PERCENT FOR MANY MANY

00:51:07.064 --> 00:51:09.700 region:rollup2
YEARS AND IT'S ACTUALLY STARTING

00:51:08.766 --> 00:51:10.935 region:rollup2
DECEPTIVELY.

00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:12.670 region:rollup2
INCREASE.

00:51:10.935 --> 00:51:16.073 region:rollup2
AND START DIXIE BILL ELEVEN

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.708 region:rollup2
PERCENT. MARK OF ENROLLMENT SO.

00:51:16.073 --> 00:51:19.143 region:rollup2
WHILE SPECIAL ED REVENUE THEN IS

00:51:17.708 --> 00:51:21.579 region:rollup2
DECLINING BASED ON TOTAL

00:51:19.143 --> 00:51:23.013 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT SPECIAL IT COSTS ARE

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:25.449 region:rollup2
NOT NECESSARILY DECLINING.

00:51:23.013 --> 00:51:27.818 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION.

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:33.524 region:rollup2
OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS MISTER

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:34.358 region:rollup2
CHAVIS.

.

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:49.940 region:rollup2
YEAH IT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS AS

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:51.342 region:rollup2
FAR AS THE PENSIONS AND SPECIAL

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:52.876 region:rollup2
EDUCATION.

00:51:51.342 --> 00:51:54.511 region:rollup2
I THINK THE COMMON I'LL JUST

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:57.715 region:rollup2
MAKE ON THAT IS.

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:58.949 region:rollup2
I THINK WERE.

00:51:57.715 --> 00:51:59.717 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING SOME LOT OF GROSS

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:01.418 region:rollup2
IN THE.

00:51:59.717 --> 00:52:03.020 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY OF OUR EDUCATION I

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:04.688 region:rollup2
HOPE WE CONTINUE TO GO THAT WAY

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:07.324 region:rollup2
SINCE MY LAST YEAR. SIMMONS

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:08.892 region:rollup2
BRIEF I WOULD. HOPE THAT THE

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:11.061 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS WOULD.

00:52:08.892 --> 00:52:12.329 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CONTINUE INVESTMENT

00:52:11.061 --> 00:52:14.365 region:rollup2
IN EDUCATION SO WE DON'T GO

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:14.565 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS AGAIN.

00:52:14.365 --> 00:52:15.799 region:rollup2
AND.

00:52:14.565 --> 00:52:18.535 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THEIR WE MAY BE A

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:20.771 region:rollup2
DOWN ECONOMY. THAT WE WOULD MAKE

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:22.840 region:rollup2
A EDUCATION A PRIORITY MUCH

00:52:20.771 --> 00:52:23.407 region:rollup2
BEYOND THE FIFTY PERCENT THAT WE

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.942 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REASON WE MADE THAT

00:52:23.407 --> 00:52:29.146 region:rollup2
ARE.

00:52:24.942 --> 00:52:32.182 region:rollup2
SCHILLING RATHER THAN THE FLOOR.

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:35.085 region:rollup2
THAT'S REPUBLICANS SAY THAT BY.

00:52:32.182 --> 00:52:36.820 region:rollup2
GET THAT DOWN YET OKAY. YEAH.

THE.

00:52:38.155 --> 00:52:40.357 region:rollup2
.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:41.825 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:44.461 region:rollup2
RELATIONS COMPONENT YOU TALKED

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:45.863 region:rollup2
ABOUT LEADERSHIP.

00:52:44.461 --> 00:52:48.465 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT IMPROVE

00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:50.534 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF HEALTHCARE.

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.770 region:rollup2
HE MENTIONED DEL CAB BRIEFLY BUT

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:54.671 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT.

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:56.006 region:rollup2
A PROCESSES WE LAID OUT IS I

00:52:54.671 --> 00:52:57.608 region:rollup2
NOTICED WE JUST WE STARTED THE

00:52:56.006 --> 00:52:59.043 region:rollup2
LOW CONTROL FUNDING INTO

00:52:57.608 --> 00:53:01.145 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OUT CAP. AS I WAS

00:52:59.043 --> 00:53:01.678 region:rollup2
TALKING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:53:01.145 --> 00:53:03.914 region:rollup2
FACT ONE OF MINE IS HERE.

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:04.314 region:rollup2
.

00:53:03.914 --> 00:53:07.051 region:rollup2
THE.

00:53:04.314 --> 00:53:08.986 region:rollup2
IN MY ESTIMATION.

00:53:07.051 --> 00:53:11.822 region:rollup2
GOING OUT TALKING TO PARENTS AND

00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:13.223 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS.

00:53:11.822 --> 00:53:15.125 region:rollup2
THIS PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:17.361 region:rollup2
DID NOT DO IS ROBUST SAID NOT

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:18.729 region:rollup2
REACH.

00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:20.731 region:rollup2
AS THE OTHER NEIGHBORS SCHOOL

00:53:18.729 --> 00:53:22.366 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AHEAD OF MY DISTRICT.

00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:25.669 region:rollup2
SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE LOOKING

00:53:22.366 --> 00:53:27.137 region:rollup2
AT A MACRO SENSE.

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:28.672 region:rollup2
CAN THE EL CAP REALLY BE A

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:29.973 region:rollup2
POSITIVE THING TO MAKE SURE WE

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:32.609 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE.

00:53:29.973 --> 00:53:33.911 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

00:53:32.609 --> 00:53:36.280 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'LL CAP IS A VERY

00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:37.915 region:rollup2
POWERFUL AND POSITIVE TOOL

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.817 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN INDUCED ARM IN SOME

00:53:37.915 --> 00:53:41.952 region:rollup2
RESPECTS ARM I THINK IT'S KINDA

00:53:39.817 --> 00:53:43.921 region:rollup2
SAD THAT. IT TOOK THE

THE EL CAP.

00:53:55.866 --> 00:53:59.970 region:rollup2
PROCESS ONE DONE IN AN

AUTHENTIC WAY.

00:53:59.970 --> 00:54:03.841 region:rollup2
REALLY AUTHENTIC.

IS.

00:54:18.222 --> 00:54:21.425 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY INCREASES

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:24.695 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:27.397 region:rollup2

WERE LISTENED TO.

00:54:31.535 --> 00:54:34.171 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.671 region:rollup2
DIALOGUE IT'S GONNA INCREASE IN

00:54:34.171 --> 00:54:36.874 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OF PROCESS

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:39.409 region:rollup2
SKINNER.

00:54:36.874 --> 00:54:39.710 region:rollup2
INCREASE ON APPRECIATION FOR THE

00:54:39.409 --> 00:54:42.079 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:43.780 region:rollup2
AND A CONTRIBUTION TO THE

00:54:42.079 --> 00:54:45.349 region:rollup2
BENEFITS AND SO ON FOR THE

00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:47.217 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS THAT ARE DOING THAT

00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:49.253 region:rollup2
THEY DO IT VERY WELL. ON THEIR

00:54:47.217 --> 00:54:50.888 region:rollup2
OUT CAPS REFLECT THAT ENGAGEMENT

00:54:49.253 --> 00:54:52.189 region:rollup2
THAT REFLECT THE COMMUNITY THAT

THE BROADER COMMUNITIES

00:54:52.189 --> 00:54:55.959 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS.

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:57.327 region:rollup2
AND THEY'LL LYING THEN THE KEY

00:54:55.959 --> 00:54:59.463 region:rollup2
TO ALL THIS IS YOUR LINE YOUR

00:54:57.327 --> 00:55:01.365 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO CARRYING OUT THOSE

00:54:59.463 --> 00:55:03.033 region:rollup2
ITEMS.

00:55:01.365 --> 00:55:04.635 region:rollup2
AND SO IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:06.503 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT HELLCAT BEING A

00:55:04.635 --> 00:55:07.938 region:rollup2
TOOL THAT HELPS US FOCUS EVEN IN

00:55:06.503 --> 00:55:10.340 region:rollup2
A CAR IN A COST CONTAINMENT

00:55:07.938 --> 00:55:11.475 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT. NOT AN EXPANSIONARY

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:12.676 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT BUT A COST

00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:14.044 region:rollup2
CONTAINMENT ENVIRONMENT THE ALL

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:16.079 region:rollup2
CAPS A TOOL THAT WILL HELP

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:17.247 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS FOCUS. ON WHAT IS

00:55:16.079 --> 00:55:18.949 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT WHAT ARE THEY GONNA

00:55:17.247 --> 00:55:21.018 region:rollup2
INVEST IN TODAY THAT'S GONNA

00:55:18.949 --> 00:55:22.352 region:rollup2
MOVE THAT NEEDLE. IN A POSITIVE

00:55:21.018 --> 00:55:24.555 region:rollup2
DIRECTION FOR KIDS WITH THEIR

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:25.889 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

00:55:24.555 --> 00:55:27.291 region:rollup2
WHATEVER THE METRIC IS THAT

00:55:25.889 --> 00:55:27.791 region:rollup2
WE'VE ASSIGNED THAT WE'VE

00:55:27.291 --> 00:55:29.259 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED TO THE EL CAP

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:31.562 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:55:29.259 --> 00:55:34.765 region:rollup2
IS OUR PRIORITY IT WILL HELP

00:55:31.562 --> 00:55:36.667 region:rollup2
THEM MOVE THAT NEEDLE AND SO ON

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:38.635 region:rollup2
IT IT HELPS FOCUS THAT. THAT

00:55:36.667 --> 00:55:39.803 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT OF THE DOLLARS THAT

00:55:38.635 --> 00:55:41.004 region:rollup2
WE GET.

00:55:39.803 --> 00:55:41.905 region:rollup2
AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.540 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE LIKE A

00:55:41.905 --> 00:55:46.210 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:47.444 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS IN THE STATE. AND SO

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:48.812 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE SMALL NUMBER THAT.

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:50.914 region:rollup2
HAVING DONE I'D BE INTERESTED TO

00:55:48.812 --> 00:55:52.449 region:rollup2
SEE NOW HOW DID THEY DO IN THE

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:55.586 region:rollup2
EL CAP AND USER. EVERITT

00:55:52.449 --> 00:55:58.455 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP THERE AND FTL CAP.

00:55:55.586 --> 00:56:01.024 region:rollup2
IS HIGHLIGHTED AS A SOLUTION.

00:55:58.455 --> 00:56:03.160 region:rollup2
THEN IF WE FOCUSED ON ON THAT

00:56:01.024 --> 00:56:04.561 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:06.396 region:rollup2
THEN WE COULD EVEN SEE A DROP

00:56:04.561 --> 00:56:09.466 region:rollup2
DOWN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY.

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:10.133 region:rollup2
BAR THE ISSUE OF US NOT FUNDING.

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.902 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOLS REGARDLESS OF

00:56:10.133 --> 00:56:14.004 region:rollup2
ECONOMICS.

00:56:11.902 --> 00:56:15.539 region:rollup2
THE.

00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:17.908 region:rollup2
AB ONE THIRTY NINE.

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:18.675 region:rollup2
EITHER TRENDS

00:56:17.908 --> 00:56:21.144 region:rollup2
YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GOING UP

00:56:18.675 --> 00:56:23.080 region:rollup2
UP ENOUGH RIGHT.

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:24.481 region:rollup2
IS THIS ISSUE THIS IS A SOFT

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.515 region:rollup2
REPORTING EFFORT IS IN THAT THEY

00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:27.885 region:rollup2
GET IDENTIFY HEY WE MAY HAVE A

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:30.420 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OR YOU GET WIND OF IT TO

00:56:27.885 --> 00:56:33.123 region:rollup2
A HOTLINE BINGO. RACE DOWN THERE

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:34.491 region:rollup2

AT THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:38.161 region:rollup2
