ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE MY FAMILY MEMBER GONZALEZ AND OTHERS AND ACTUALLY TO EMPLOYMENT MAKING A PREPARATION THEREFORE. THIS GONZALEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AB FIVE ON CONCURRENCE AFTER SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATIONS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES AND STAKEHOLDERS. AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE OUT OF THE FOLLOWING PROFESSIONAL EXEMPTIONS. IF NOBODY CARES I CAN JUST SAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR- VOTE ON CONCURRENCE OKAY WE DO HAVE SOME PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE EXEMPTIONS NOW. I'M GET. I'M TO GO THROUGH THEM QUICKLY THEN. DENTIST PODIATRIST CYCLE WHAT PSYCHOLOGISTS LAWYERS ARCHITECTS ENGINEERS VETERAN. VETERINARIANS PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS ACCOUNTANTS COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND REPOSSESSION AGENTS. THE BILL CLARIFY THE PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING SERVICES AS A SMALL BUSINESS ENTITY COULD CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS UNDER THE PREVIOUS FOR OUR STANDARD. THESE PROFESSIONALS INCLUDE MARKETING PROFESSIONALS ADMINISTRATORS OF HUMAN RESOURCES TRAVEL AGENTS GRAPHIC DESIGNERS GRANT WRITERS FINE ARTISTS ENROLLED AGENTS. PAYMENT PROCESSING AGENTS FREELANCE PHOTOGRAPHERS PHOTOJOURNALIST WRITERS EDITORS AND CARTOONIST WHO SUBMIT TO A PUBLICATION NO MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE TIMES A YEAR CAN CONTINUE TO DO SO. AND LICENSED COSMETOLOGIST BARBERS ESTHETICIANS ELECTROLYSIS. MANICURIST GIVEN THAT THEY PROVIDE A FORM TEN NINETY NINE TO THE SALON WHEN THEY ARE RENTING BUSINESS SPACE CAN CONTINUE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SMALL BUSINESS. THIS BILL ALSO EXEMPTS TRUE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CONTRACTS SUCH AS CONTRACT WITH THE LICENSE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR INCLUDING FOR SUBCONTRACTOR CONSTRUCTION TRACKING SERVICES. AND LET ME TALK FOR ONE MINUTE ABOUT TRACKING BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE COME UP TO ME WITH CONCERNS ABOUT TRACKING THEIR TWO THINGS IN THIS BILL. IF YOU ARE AN OWNER OPERATOR AND YOU YOU LICENSE ARE YOU CONTRACT WITH A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO CONTRACT IN THAT WAY DIRECTLY WITH A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY THAT SUNSETS INTEREST YOUR SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF IT NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED. IF YOU ARE A OWNER OPERATOR BASICALLY OUTSIDE OF CONSTRUCTION THERE ARE FEW THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU YOU CAN BECOME A LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESS WHICH CASE YOU CAN DIRECTLY CONTRACT WITH A BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR FARM AND YOU NEED TO DELIVER YOUR PRODUCT YOU CAN HIRE AN INDIVIDUAL. HAS A SMALL AS TO DELIVER YOUR PRODUCT. YOU DON'T WANT TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS YOU CAN BECOME AN EMPLOYEE OF A LARGER BUSINESS IF YOU'RE THAT AN EMPLOYEE OF THAT LARGER BUSINESS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY UTILIZE YOUR TRUCK THAT YOU HAVE BOUGHT IN THE BUSINESS HAS TO REIMBURSE YOU FOR THAT SO WE THAT'S WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY IN THE BILL WE ARE NOT LEAVING PEOPLE WITH A TRACK IN NO WAY TO USE IT. WE ARE HOWEVER. IT OF AN OUTDATED BROKER MODEL THAT ALLOWS COMPANIES TO BASICALLY MAKE MONEY AND SET RATES FOR PEOPLE THAT THEY CALLED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT ACT A LOT LIKE EMPLOYEES. IT'S A COMPROMISE I THINK WORKS FOR THE ACTUAL WORKER. THE MEMINTA THE SENATE ALSO CLARIFY THAT BUSINESS ENTITIES PERFORM WORK. FOR CLIENT OR BUSINESS OR REFERRAL AGENCY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE TEST UNDER DYNAMAX THE COVERED BUSINESSES AND THIS MEANS THE REFERRAL IN AGENCY IS NOT. COVERED THE BUSINESSES INCLUDE GRAPHIC DESIGN WEB DESIGN PHOTOGRAPHY TUTORING EVENT PLANNING MINOR HOME REPAIR MOVING HOME CLEANING AARON'S EVENT PLANNING. FURNITURE ASSEMBLY ANIMAL SERVICES DOG WALKING DOG GROOMING PICTURE HANGING POOL CLEANING AND YARD CLEAN UP AS LONG AS YOU HOLD A BUSINESS LICENSE. DUE TO CONCERNS FROM BUSINESS COMMUNITY REYES REGARDING RETROACTIVITY THE BILL MAKES CLEAR THAT ALL EXEMPTIONS IN THIS BILL ARE RETROACTIVE. IN ADDITION ANY NEW OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE BILL WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. WORKERS COMPENSATION REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT RETROACTIVE IN WILL BE EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. AB FIVE TERRIFIED AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SPECIFIED CITY ATTORNEYS CAN ENFORCE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL BY SEEKING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF TO STOP THE EXPLOITATION OF MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS. COLLEAGUES AB FIVE DOESN'T ADDRESS EVERY SINGLE ISSUE BROUGHT TO US. BUT IT GETS THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE THERE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON OUTSTANDING ISSUES WITH THOSE YOU HAVE BROUGHT SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES TO US THAT MAKES SENSE. IT'S A COMPROMISED APPROACH FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND ALLOWS CLARITY FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES AND AT THAT SAME TIME. AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ONE MILLION INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN CALIFORNIA. GET THE WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE CONCURRENCE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS GONZALEZ MISTER O'DONNELL TO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER COLLEAGUES I RISE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE. WHEN THIS BILL LAUGHED THE ASSEMBLY I REYES SOME OBJECTIONS TO IT AND I WAS IN HOPES THAT AS THE BILL MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE. THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL WOULD BE FIXED IN A BROADWAY THAT APPLY TO ALL THE DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT INSTEAD WHAT'S BEEN DONE. IS A LAUNDRY LIST OF EXEMPTIONS HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED THAT ANY INDUSTRY WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO HIRE A GOOD LOBBYIST YOU GET ON THIS LIST ALL OF THE INDUSTRIES THE COULDN'T ART. AND MY BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THAT APPROACH. IS THAT IT STIFLES INNOVATION AN ENTREPRENEURIAL ISM HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHAT ALSO IS NOT ON THAT LIST AS ALL OF THE INDUSTRIES. THAT ARE UP AND COMING. THAT DON'T HAVE AN ESTABLISHED. WE DON'T. TELL PREVENT THOSE BUSINESSES FROM BEING STARTED HERE. WHEN I TESTIFIED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY I TOLD YOU THE STORY OF HOW I STARTED MY BUSINESS OUT OF MY DORM ROOM THIRTY YEARS AGO. THE BILL WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE SO CALLED B. PILLAR. IN THE DYNAMICS TEST AND THAT SAYS THAT YOU CAN'T CONTRACT OUT ANY WORK THAT IS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR THE BUSINESS THAT YOU'RE OPERATING AT ALL HAS TO BE EMPLOYEES. I WAS A KID IN MY DORM ROOM I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION OUR POSTING REQUIREMENTS ARE WAGE ORDERS OR ANY OF THAT. AND FRANKLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO DAUNTING FOR ME TO TRY AND START A BUSINESS AND THINK ABOUT COMPLYING. WITH THOSE REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT BUSINESS WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN STARTED HERE WE HAVE BEEN STARTED ELSEWHERE. AND THE HUNDREDS OF JOBS THAT MY BUSINESS IS CREATED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. WOULD NOT BE IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD BE ELSEWHERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO US. CALIFORNIA USED TO BE. A PLACE WHERE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. WAS NURTURED. WE'VE HAD INCREDIBLE SUCCESS AND HAVING COMPANIES START HERE COMPANIES LIKE APPLE AND GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND MY COMPANY. I FEAR THAT IF THIS IS THE THINKING OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS THE THINKING OF OUR GOVERNOR I REALLY FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE. AND ONE THING THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IN CLOSING HERE IS THE FACT THAT. I'M TIRED OF HEARING PEOPLE SAY. THAT THIS BILL EMPOWERS WORKERS THIS BILL DOES NOT EMPOWER WORKERS THIS BILL DISENFRANCHISES WORKERS IT DISEMPOWERED AS WORKERS AND IF YOU WANT PROOF OF THAT. YOU NEED LOOK NOFURTHER. THAN THE INDUSTRIES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL WHICH ARE THE TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LEFT RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE A DRIVER FOR THOSE TNC IS YOU GET TO DECIDE ON YOUR OWN. WHERE YOU POSITION YOUR VEHICLE AND WHEN YOU DRIVE AND THAT WILL BECOME IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THIS BILL BECOMES LAW. AND I'VE HAD PEOPLE SAY WELL NO THE BILL DOESN'T DISALLOW IT WILL YES IT DOES ACTUALLY IF YOU READ IT IT SAYS THAT THOSE DRIVERS HAVE TO BE EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE WHICH MEANS THAT. IF YOU'RE OVER LEFT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER WE'RE VEHICLE IS LOCATED AND WHEN A DRIVER DRIVES YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO ALLOW THE DRIVER. TO POSITION A VEHICLE IN A BAD SECTION OF TOWN AND DRIVE A TWO O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BECAUSE THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO MAKE UP THAT MINIMUM WAGE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY. SO I FEAR THAT THIS IS REALLY GOING TO DO DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA I URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OPEN ALL TEAM THIS EGGMAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP IN A SPEAKER MEMBERS I. I RISE. ONLY I FEEL IT MY DUTY OBLIGATION AS THE CHAIR OF BAG TO BE ABLE TO GET UP AND SAY THIS ISSUE THAT WE- CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. IS TRUCKERS THAT ARE HAULING THINGS FOR AGRICULTURE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT REMAINS AN ISSUE. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE SAID WE WILL BE DEALING WITH THIS. ISSUE FOR THE NEXT PROBABLY THE REST OF OUR TIME IN THIS HOUSE WHICH I THINK IS PROBABLY TRUE. AS THE YEARS CONTINUE TO GO ON A NEW ISSUES CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE. SO I RISE ONLY TO RAISE A CONCERN THAT I THINK THEY'RE STILL. I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE I THINK THERE'S MORE NEAT WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE. GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MISS EGGMAN MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. COLLEAGUES I RISE TODAY AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OPPOSED TO AB FIVE. IN THE WAKE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION IN THE DYNAMICS CASE. IT WAS CLEAR WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING WITHOUT ACTION THE SUPREME. COURT'S DECISION WOULD WRECK OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. BUT THIS BILL ISN'T THE ANSWER. RATHER THAN FIXING THE WAVE WE DEFINE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TO STOP BAD ACTORS AB FIVE MAKES A BAD LAW WITH A- LITTLE LESS BAD AND CARVE OUTS FOR THE TRADE GROUPS. WITH THE BEST LOBBYIST. WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS WHO DON'T HAVE THOSE LOBBYIST. I WAS FORTUNATE WHEN I STARTED MY BUSINESS. BY HARD WORK AND IT'S CERTAINLY HARD ENOUGH ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA TO START A BUSINESS. AND MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL. AND YES. I HIRED FOLKS. MANY OF THOSE WERE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ALMOST ALL SECOND CHANCE THERE'S- MANY PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED. SEASONAL AND SHORT TERM EMPLOYMENT ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IS FOR THESE WORKERS AND OTHERS. TO PURSUE EDUCATION WHILE GAINING NEEDED EXPERIENCE IN THE WORK FORCE. FOR MANY BUSINESSES THAT WON'T BE POSSIBLE UNDER THIS DYNAMIX RULING. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE CALLED US ABOUT THEIR TYPES OF JOBS ARE THEY EXEMPTED ARE THEY NOT THEY WON AN EXEMPTION LIKE EVEN THIS MORNING INTERPRETERS FROM ESCONDIDO CALL WANTING AN AMENDMENT TO ADD THEM IN. SO IF WE NEED THAT MANY EXEMPTIONS AND THE LIST. WAS I COULDN'T WRITE FAST NOW FULLY EXEMPTIONS IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A SWISS CHEESE WITH A LOT OF HOLES IN IT. AT SOME POINT IT'S JUST NOT A GOOD BILL. GET WORKERS WILL LOSE THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT IT'S ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO RUN THEIR LIVES MANY WILL SEE THEIR WORK OPPORTUNITIES ELIMINATED. THE IMPACT OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION WILL BE TRAGIC AND SEVERE FOR WORKERS WHO RELY ON CONTRACTING TO MAKE ENDS MEET OR BUILD THE BUSINESS OF THEIR OWN. WE OWE IT TO THEM TO DELIVER A THOUGHTFULLY CRAFTED SOLUTION. THAT STOPS MISS CLASSIFICATION WHILE PROTECTING THE INDEPENDENCE OF CONTRACTORS WHO VALUE THEIR FREEDOM TO WORK WHEN AND WHEN THEY ONCE WERE. IN THIS BILL FALLS SHORT OF THAT STANDARD AND I URGE NO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MEMBERS OF YOUR SEEKING RECOGNITION PLEASE RAISE YOUR MIKE'S. MISTER CALDERON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT. IF WE DON'T PASS THIS BILL THERE ARE NO EXEMPTIONS NOBODY'S GONNA BE EXAM BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IT'S A DREAM COURT DECISION SO EVERYBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES THIS BILL ALLOWS THE BUSINESSES. THAT ARE IN THE BILL TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION WHERE THEY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE HAVE IT BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY THE LAW OF THE LAND. NOW BEFORE I CAME HERE. I HAD A SHORT STAND IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR I WORKED IN PRIVATE SECTOR FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND I WAS IT WAS CLASSIFIED WORKER. I WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT WAS OWNED BY BAYER CORPORATION. AND THEY MADE AN INDEPENDENT COP ACTOR THEY MADE ME AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT HAVE TO PAY THE BENEFITS OF WHAT THEY WOULD PLAY A NORMAN CHLOE HOWEVER. IF I WAS AN EMPLOYEE I WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE TIME I DON'T HAVE ANY HEALTH INSURANCE IT WOULD MEAN A LOT MORE BENEFITS THAT I WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO BEEN AFFORDED HAD I NOT BEEN DEEMED AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT MY WORK LOAD WAS SO RIGOROUS THAT THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WAS NO WAY I WASN'T ESTABLISHED BUSINESS THERE WAS NO WAY THAT I'M COULD HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO TAKE ON ANY OTHER CLIENTS THEY WERE MY ONLY CLIENT THAT WAS ALL THE WORKLOAD. WAS TOO GREAT THE SCHEDULE WAS TOO DEMANDING AND SO I WAS AN EMPLOYEE THAT WAS CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND I WAS TREATED AS SUCH EVEN THOUGH THE WORK I WAS DOING WAS THE WORK OF AN EMPLOYEE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND WHAT IS FORCE US TO DO NOT JUST US IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S FORCED THE NATION TO TAKE A LOOK WHAT THE WHAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS GONNA LOOK LIKE SO THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT. AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US THOUGH CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I CAN'T SAY THAT OUR TRADITIONAL IDEA OF WHAT WORK IS EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IF THAT'S ALL THAT THERE IS I CAN'T SIT HERE AND TELL YOU THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S ON US TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THIS BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP CREATIVITY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO STOP INNOVATION IF THEY CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND OUR WORK. OUR OUR LABOR LAWS NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOR THE ABILITY FOR US TO ALLOW ALL TYPES OF WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THIS CONVERSATION ISN'T STOP HERE BUT I REALLY COMMEND THE WORK OF THE AUTHOR NOT FOR ANYTHING AND SHE'S DONE AND I COMMEND EVERYBODY ON ALL SIDES COME TOGETHER ON THIS RECEIPT. IN IT'S IMPORTANT THE CONVERSATION ISN'T OVER. HEY BUT TODAY THIS IS THE ACTION THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CALDERON MISTER WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU AMANDA SPEAKER AND MEMBERS AYE AYE AYE AYE RISE I I'D SUPPORT THE BILL WHEN IT WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME OF THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS SPECIFICALLY AROUND HOSPITALS AND NURSING REGISTRIES SO. WHILE PARTS OF THIS MAY WORK REALLY WELL IN LARGE URBAN AREAS WE RELY ON NURSING REGISTRIES IN SOME OF OUR RURAL AREAS TO HELP SUPPLEMENT NURSING STAFF IT'S HARD TO GET NURSES TO SOME COMMUNITIES IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU PAY PEOPLE SOMETIMES TO LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES THEY SIMPLY MAY NOT WANT TO LIVE THERE AND SO I HAVE REAL CONCERNS THAT THAT THIS PART OF THIS. MAY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN SYNDICATE BUT I THINK THAT THIS COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AROUND HOSPITALS IF WE DON'T FIX THIS PART OF IT SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT I LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON THIS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER WHAT MISTER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I MOVED TO AMEND THE BILL IN CHIEF TO EXEMPT OWNER OPERATOR TRUCKERS WITH OWNING FIVE TRUCKS OR LESS MR GALLAGHER THE BILL IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE SO WE CANNOT AMENDED ON THE FLOOR AT THIS TIME. WELL I WOULD I WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE DO THE SAME THING THAT WE'VE DONE FOR SEVERAL OTHER BILLS THIS WEEK WAVING RULES TO MAKE AMENDMENTS.

THE GENTLEMAN TO NICOLAS WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE BILL HE'S MORE THAN WELCOME TO DO SO BUT THIS IS THE BASED ON THE BILL. HE NEEDS TO KEEP HIS COMMENTS SPECIFIC TO THE DEBATE.

MORE THAN SEVENTY TWO HOURS MOVING BACK TO DEBATE ON. AMERICA THE BILL. THIS RACE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I RISE. IN FAVOR OF AB FIVE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I IN MY PRIOR LIFE I WAS A WORKERS COMPENSATION ATTORNEY REPRESENTING INJURED WORKERS AND IN THAT CAPACITY I HAVE MANY WORKERS WHO WERE DENIED WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS BECAUSE THEY WERE CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN ALL OF THESE CASES WE HAVE TO GO TO TRIAL AND ALL OF THESE CASES WE WON BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO PROVE THAT REALITY THEY WERE EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE BEEN PROTECTED UNDER OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION. LAWS. AS OUR MEMBER FROM WHAT HERE IS INDICATED IT MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT BILL BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT IT IS A NECESSARY BILL WE NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING IN. IN PRINT SOME WE NEED TO PASS THE LAW THAT PROTECTS OUR WORKERS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE COVERED AS WORKERS AND NOT MISS CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS WRATH MR BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE AND THANK THE AUTHOR FROM SAN DIEGO FOR THE VERY HARD WORK THAT SHE'S PUT IN OVER MANY MONTHS ON THIS BILL. WHILE THE MACRO ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO DO PRETTY WELL THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR STATE WHO HAVE NOT REAP THE BENEFITS OF THAT ECONOMY. I'M IN A PARTICULAR WE KNOW THAT GIG WORKERS WHO ARE OUT THERE ARE NOT REALLY SHARING IN THAT ECONOMY THEY'RE MAKING VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF MONEY THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS. THAT THAT OTHER WORKERS GET. UP SO THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE WHO ARE NOT SHARING IN THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF THE OF THE RESURGENCE OF OUR ECONOMY OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO. AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WHEN THE OWNERS OF SOME COMPANIES WALK AWAY WITH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND THEIR WORKERS ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND DO NOT RECEIVE BENEFITS THAT THEY SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO. THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED MANY AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL FOR GOOD REASON THIS IS A VERY VERY COMPLICATED LANDSCAPE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF PRUNING THAT'S NECESSARY. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS MANY OF THESE ISSUES MANY OF THE AREAS OF EMPLOYMENT THAT STILL NEED WORK I'M ONE OF THOSE THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. A PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT BUT REALLY ACROSS THE STATE. IS THAT OF MUSICIANS AND WHILE SOME MUSICIANS ARE COVERED BECAUSE IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES IN THE SETTING THAT THEIR THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY IN. SUMMER NOT AND I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR MADAM SPEAKER. AND THAT IS WHETHER OR NOT. A CONSIDERATION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE NOT CLEARLY COVERED GAG MUSICIANS WHO ARE NOT CLEARLY COVERED AS AN EMPLOYEES TODAY. MISS GONZALEZ YOU MAY ANSWER YEAH I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE MUSICIANS PROBABLY FALL INTO A FEW DIFFERENT CATEGORIES BUT IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINE SUBDIVISION SEE SUBSECTION TWO PARAGRAPHS SIX YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE IS AN EXEMPTION. IF A FINE ARTIST AND I WOULD SUGGEST IN FACT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT MUSICIANS ARE FINE ARTIST IF THEY ACTUALLY QUALIFY UNDER A DIFFERENT. SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES THEY BASICALLY SET THEIR OWN RATES RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESS THAT THEY ARE IN FACT ALREADY IN THIS BILL HOWEVER I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONCERN. AND I KNOW THAT THE DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE ROUTE RECORDING ARTISTS AND THE ENTERTAINMENT UNIONS BROKE DOWN AND- THEIR SPECIFIC. EXEMPTION WAS TAKE THE LANGUAGE WAS TAKEN OUT BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY'D RATHER HAVE NOTHING THEN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY HAD COME UP WITH. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO REFINE THAT LANGUAGE AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S COVERED BUT I'D SAY RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE WORKING AS AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS. BASICALLY SELLING YOUR SERVICES AS A FINE ARTIST THAT YOU'RE UNDER YOUR OWN CONTROL YOU COULD BE PERFORMING IN FACT AT THE- THE EMPLOYERS. PLACE OR YOUR OWN I USE IT AS LONG AS YOU'RE SETTING YOUR OWN RATES IN YOUR UNDER YOUR OWN CONTROL I THINK THAT YOU FALL UNDER THAT FINE ARTISTS EXEMPTION. THANK YOU ASKED OFFICER BLOOM MY TIME MADAM SPEAKER. I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE AND- A TAKE THAT IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S AMBIGUITY OR THAT THEY NEED TO BE MORE WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I'LL COMMIT TO. PROVIDING MY INPUT AND HELP ON RESOLVING THE ISSUE AND THE- UPCOMING A SECOND YEAR. OF OUR OF OUR TWO YEAR SESSION AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL THE HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AND I. URGE ALL MEMBERS TO VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK MEDI SPEAKER MEMBERS I BUY RICE OUT IN OPPOSITION AB. THE VERY. FACT OF THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING ON THIS FLOOR RIGHT NOW. IT ALMOST SOUNDS TO ME. LIKE EXEMPTIONS OUR GUESTS UP FOR NEGOTIATION AND THEY'RE UP FOR AUCTION. THIS IS A VERY TROUBLING PROCESS THAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS TO TREAT. I TENTATIVELY PLACED INDIVIDUALS. IN DIFFERENT. CIRCUMSTANCES AND CALLING THEM ONE THING WHEN THEY'RE NOT. LET ME JUST SAY THIS. FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO PASSED JUST LAWS. PART OF JUST LAWMAKING IS TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT WE ARE NOT STEPPING OVER A VERY IMPORTANT LINE WHICH IS EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. WE HAVE MANY IDENTICALLY PLACED PEOPLE. WHO ARE NOT EQUALLY PROTECTED IN THIS LAW. WE ARE. PLAYING A POLITICAL RUSSIAN ROULETTE. WITH THEIR LIVES THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND THEIR LABOR. BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING HERE IS SETTING UP A CATEGORY. THAT IS PROTECTED FROM THE COURTS. LEAVING. MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS I'M PROTECTED FROM THE COURT. AND WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A SOLUTION. ALSO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING LAW HERE. THAT WE KEEP SAYING WELL WE'RE GOING TO VISIT THIS WILL VISIT IT NEXT YEAR THE YEAR AFTER THE YEAR AFTER. WE'RE BASICALLY. ON THE FLY. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WERE GOING TO PENALIZE AND WHO WE ARE GOING TO GIVE A SAFE HARBOR TO. THAT IS NOT OBJECTIVE Là MAKING IT IS NOT FAIR LAW MAKING. IT IS VERY MUCH SUBJECTIVE LAWMAKING WE'RE ON A SLIPPERY SLOPE HERE AND THAT'S WHY YOU ARE SEEING SO MUCH ANGST AND SO MUCH CONCERN ABOUT WHY IS MY BUSINESS MODEL IDENTICAL TO THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS PROTECTED AND MINE IS NOT. I FEAR THAT APART FROM. PERHAPS MAKING SOME SAFE HARBORS FOR COURT ACTIVITY THE. APPROACH HERE CHOOSING WINNERS AND LOSERS IN LIKE SITUATED CIRCUMSTANCES IS GOING TO OPEN IN MY JUDGMENT THE FLOODGATE. OF LITIGATION. AND I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT TRYING TO REMEDY AND SO I APPRECIATE. THE CONVERSATION HERE. LET'S REMEMBER WE ARE TREATING LIKE PEOPLE. THEN ON LIKE WAYS YES THIS IS A YEAH I THINK THIS IS FUNDAMENTALLY OF LEGISLATING ON VERY VERY TRICKY TERRITORY HERE. AND LAST. YOU CONSIDER THAT I'M EXAGGERATING THERE ARE SEVERAL COURT CASES RIGHT NOW THAT ARE WINNING CHALLENGES AGAINST THIS BODY. FOR LEGISLATING AND CROSSING THE LINE OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW AND SO I'M GOING TO BE OF NO VOTE AND I SUGGEST THAT IN THE INTEREST OF FAIRNESS OUT TO ALL OF THAT THIS BILL. NEEDS TO BE DEFEATED AND IT NEEDS TO BE REWORKED SO THAT WE ARE FAIR TO EVERYBODY IN LIKE CIRCUMSTANCES. OR WE SHOULDN'T DO ANYTHING AT ALL THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MISTER LEVINE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IF YOU'RE A MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY FIVE. THIS CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME AND AS THE CHAIR OF LABOUR KNOWS IN AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL KNOWS I HAVE ALSO. BEEN WORKING TO RAISE THE PLIGHT OF SUBCONTRACTED LABOR SOME OF THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS IN OUR STATE IN THE WEALTHIEST CORPORATIONS ON EARTH HAVE BEEN. SUBCONTRACTING LABOR TO PAY THEM LESS OFTEN WOMEN OFTEN IMMIGRANTS OFTEN IN JANITORIAL OR FOOD SERVICE ROLES TO PUT THEM OFF THEIR BOOKS. AND THEY ARE NOT PAID WITH THE DIGNITY ANDRESPECT OF OTHER EMPLOYEES THAT BRING VALUE TO CALL THESE COMPANIES BUT OF COURSE THESE COMPANIES COULDN'T EXIST WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE SUB CONTRACTED LABOR AS WELL. SO I LOOK FOR TO VOTING FOR THIS I ALSO LOOK FORTY COMING BACK IN JANUARY AND ADDRESSING THE PLIGHT OF SOME CAUGHT SUBCONTRACTED LABOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER LANE MISTER GRAY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS GOING TO RISE AND SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE BUSINESS TO THE BAIT. I FIND MYSELF PROBABLY THINKING WHAT A LOT OF MEMBERS ON THIS FOR THINKING WHICH IS A FALSE CHOICE. THE FORCE. THERE'S A LOT OF SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT BEEN TAKEN CARE OF IN THIS BILL AS WE LOOK AT THE THREE PART TEST AND RECOGNIZE THAT THAT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR THE ENTIRE ECONOMY THE COURT IN ESSENCE AND THEY WOULD ARGUE THEY INTERPRETED THE LAW THEY REWROTE THE LAW THEY REWROTE THE TEST THAT QUESTION SHOULD NOW BE BACK BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE FOR US TO ESTABLISH A TEST THAT WORKS. FOR THE ENTIRE ECONOMY. END IF I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. I HELP SOME. PROBABLY DAMAGE THE INTEREST OF OTHERS GOING FORWARD THEIR ABILITY TO SEEK AMENDMENTS LATER AS AS- AS THE AUTHOR HAS SUGGESTED A FURTHER CLARIFICATION AS OTHER MEMBERS HAVE SUGGESTED CLARIFICATION OF WHAT HAPPENED IF IT DOES HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN FOR THE POLITICALLY POPULAR SPECIAL INTEREST MOSTLY DOMINATED BY COASTAL AND LA AND SAN FRANCISCO. CERTAINLY THOSE OF US THAT REPRESENTS RURAL CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE WON'T FIND YOURSELF IN A POSITION TO GET THE RIGHT CAR ABOUT TO GET THE EXEMPTION. AND IF IN FACT. WE HAVE A THREE PART TEST THAT WORKS FOR THE ECONOMY WHY ARE WE DOING EXEMPTIONS AT ALL. WHY ARE WE REQUIRE WRITING THE THREE PART TEST. TO AN APPROPRIATE DEFINITION NOW THAT WORK MAY BE TOUGH AND I DON'T BEGRUDGE THE. DIFFICULTY IN THE LAYERS OF THIS ISSUE THAT I KNOW THE AUTHOR OTHERS HAVE STRUGGLED. TO NAVIGATE BUT I DON'T THINK HERE IN THIS. THE BILL BEFORE US WE'VE SOLVE THE ISSUE DO WE WANT TO PROVIDE SOME PROTECTION PERHAPS AGAINST LITIGATION FOR AFFECTED INDUSTRIES RIGHT AWAY I THINK THAT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH WE HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH WE HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A SOLUTION FOR ALL AND WHAT WE HAVE IS AND I OWE YOU A PROMISE TO FIX THINGS LATER. AND MEMBERS I'VE SEEN TOO MANY I OR USE. IN THIS INSTITUTION TO ME IS A BY HEARD ALL WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE. OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY LATER WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF AGRICULTURE LATER. AND IT NEVER HAPPENS. SO I FIND MYSELF IN A POSITION TODAY. TO CAST NO VOTE. I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL. TO CAP NOBLE ON THE BILL BEFORE IT. THANK YOU MISTER GRAY AGAIN MEMBERS OF YOUR SEEKING RECOGNITION PLEASE RAISE YOUR MIKE'S MISS COM LONGER W. ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I KNOW THAT THE TALK IN THE CHAMBERS HAS BEEN MOSTLY AROUND THE GIG ECONOMY AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THE GIG ECONOMY DEBATE TO SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THE ROOM ON THIS VERY COMPLICATED THIS VERY NEW ONES THIS VERY MULTI LAYERED ISSUE THAT IN ALL HONESTY AS WE'VE HEARD DESERVES PROBABLY MORE BILLS AND CERTAINLY MUCH MORE TIME AND DEBATE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE AS A STATE WE MUST RESPOND THE SUPREME COURT RULING. AND THIS BILL. IS A FIRST STEP I WANT TO. THANK AND CONGRATULATE THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL FOR STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE AND INTO THE FIRE TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE. I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS THAT WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR WORKERS I ALSO ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO NOT FORGET ABOUT THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS I THINK I SPOKE ABOUT THIS WHEN IT CAME BEFORE US IN THE ASSEMBLY A COUPLE OF MONTHS TAKE OUT OF A MONTHS AGO. YOU KNOW I HEARING FROM A NUMBER OF CONSTITUENTS IN DISTRICT FROM A COUPLE OF IT TREES FROM OUR HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY ON THE OF CARE SIDE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE DENTISTS YOU KNOW WHO A CONTRACT WITH HIGH GENUS OR SPECIALISTS OR DENTAL SURGEONS WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. BUSINESSES WHERE FOLKS ACTUALLY LIKE BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AREN'T. HAVE UNRAVELED THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY'S STYLISTS DESIGNERS EDITORS WHO MAY BE CONSIDERED FINE ARTISTS UNDER THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL ARE NOT ALSO COMPROMISED SO I AM CERTAINLY PLEDGING TO VOTE ON THIS BILL I'M AND I'M ALSO PLEDGING TO COME UP TO COMMIT MYSELF TO COMING TO THE TABLE AS WE WORK ON MAKING THIS FIRST STEP BETTER. BECAUSE WE ARE A VERY DIVERSE. THE VERY LARGE POPULATION IN A VERY VERY COMPLICATED ECONOMY AND MANY OF OUR REGIONAL ECONOMIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ACTUALLY DRIVEN BY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT I AM SURE WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE WORKERS WHO ARE EMPLOYEES. ARE TREATED AS SUCH AND GIVEN THE DIGNITY THAT THEY SERVE TO PRESERVE SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS AND I. THINK THAT YOU HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO ARE YOUR ALLIES IN THIS FIGHT THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS BILL BECOMES A BILL THAT'S ACTUALLY TRULY REFLECTIVE OF THE DIVERSITY AND THE STRENGTH OF THIS ECONOMY AND STATE SOMETHING. AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB FIVE THANK YOU MISS COM LETTER TO HAVE MISTER LOW YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. RISE TO. SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE AS WE HAVE A VEHICLE IN FRONT OF US. ALSO DO WANT TO SHARE A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT. NEED TO BE ADDRESSED NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE THINGS AND OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED. BUT TAXI CAB DRIVERS THAT OF TOM INTEREST. AND YES THAT OF THE GIG ECONOMY I'VE NOT HEARD THE CONVERSATION WITH RESPECT TO THE GIG ECONOMY. AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM SILICON VALLEY. BACK OFFICE HOW DO WE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GIG ECONOMY. I'M SURE MAJORITY OF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE APPS ON YOUR PHONE AND YOU'VE UTILIZED THEM I'M SURE YOU HAVE EQUALLY DONE YOUR HOMEWORK TO ASK THE CONVERSATION AND ASKED THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT IS IT LIKE TO DRIVE. WHAT IS YOUR EXPERIENCE LIKE AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THAT CONVERSATION AS LIGHT FROM A NUMBER OF THEM SAYING THAT THEY ARE TEACHERS OR THEIR SINGLE MOTHERS TRYING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF LIVING PEOPLE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS SEEN ON OUTSIDE IS DEMONIZATION DEMONIZATION OF INDUSTRY THAT IS CALIFORNIA BORN WITH RESPECT INNOVATION IN OUR COMMUNITY AND IN OUR STATE. I LET ME JUST REMIND THIS LEGISLATURE THAT THERE WAS A BALLOT PROPOSITION IN A BALLOT PROPONENT LAST YEAR. WHO WE HAD A SENSE OF URGENCY IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO SAY NO WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT THEREFORE LET US FIX THIS IN THE LEGISLATURE MEMBERS AS A POINT OF FACT THERE IS CLOSE AT NINE MILLION DOLLAR BALLOT MEASURE. THE GATE CON TO TRY AND FIX THIS ISSUE I THINK IT'S UP TO A COMPROMISE AND YET THERE'S NO SENSE OF URGENCY FOR US TO TRY TO KEEP UP WITH A COMPROMISE HERE BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE TALK. AND SO I URGE CAN WHEN THINKING ABOUT THE D. IS EIGHT AND A- FIRST THEM. NOT TO COMPLETE FOR THE- AND WHAT IS FACT THE CONSUMER HAS SENT TO LET US WORK WITH. SECTORS IN SAYING THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU EXIST WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO HOLD YOU TO ACCOUNT AND PARTNER TO MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY AND SOCIETY IN THE ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE. NOT JUST FOR THE EXECUTIVES AND C. SUITE BUT FOR ALL WORKERS ALIKE BUT THIS CONVERSATION ON THE OUTSIDE AND INSIDE HAS BEEN SIMPLY WE DON'T WANT TO TOUCH IT IT'S TOO MUCH OF A POLITICAL POLITICAL NIGHTMARE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. AND YET WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO AND SO LET US THINK ABOUT THE POTENTIAL HIGH POP OR SEE THAT IS THIS WHEN WE SAY THAT WE WANT TO TAKE SOMETHING ABOUT. FOR A PREVIOUS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND YET WE DON'T WANT DO ANYTHING WE'RE JUST GONNA COMPLETELY NOR THE SO THIS IS OUR DUTY THIS IS OUR JOB AS STATE LET WE'RE ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS. AND SO WHILE I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE. AS IT IS A VIçT ONE THIS IS. A GREAT AMOUNT OF WORK BY LEADERS FROM THE MEMBER FROM SAN DIEGO. I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK UP FOR INNOVATION ECONOMY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT. AND LOSS IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE MUST HOLD THEM TO ACCOUNT WE MUST. AND THEY HAVE BEEN HERE. THEY HAVE BEEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO WITH A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. THIS LEGISLATURE MY COLLEAGUES TO THINK COLLABORATIVELY. ABOUT WHAT WE DO IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEIR NUMBERS OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. I'LL BUT LET US MOVE THIS BOARD FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE WORKER. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP. AGAIN I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL OF THIS MEASURE. URGE CAUTION MEN THINK ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING TOWARDS THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE. SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE TO ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING AB FIVE. EACH YEAR WE VOTE ON A HANDFUL OF ISSUES THAT WILL HAVE A% LASTING IMPACT. ON OUR STATE AND THIS IS THIS IS ONE SUCH DEL. TECHNOLOGY IS OUR FUTURE WE ALL KNOW THAT AND THE TECH COMPANIES ARE CERTAINLY LOOKING IN THAT DIRECTION. SADLY WHAT THEY- IS THE PLACE WHERE WORKERS EITHER GIVE UP THEIR JOBS TO MACHINES OR HAVE THEIR WORK LIVES BROKEN INTO TINY PIECES. THE GIG ECONOMY IS BASED ON FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS BUT WITH OUTDATED AND FEUDAL WORK RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S THE ONLY AFFORD A USE OF THE SPEECH. IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE SO CALLED RIGHT SHARE APP COMPANIES WANT TO PROVIDE RIDES WITH DRIVERLESS CARS. BUT WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO PAVE THE WAY TO THAT FUTURE BY CRUSHING THE DREAMS AND THE LIVES OF WORKERS. I ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO DECENT JOBS AND HAVE HEALTHCARE. AND HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR HOUSING AND WITH A DECENT ENVIRONMENT TO JOIN ON THEIR TIME OFF. THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK THREE JOBS TO MAKE A LIVING IS NOT FREEDOM. I ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER IS CONSOLIDATING MY CLOSE THANK YOU AND I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A FEW COMMENTS MADE ON THIS FLOOR. I THINK IT'S HIGHLY OFFENSIVE. TO SUGGEST. THAT WE NEED TO START OVER. CONTRA ARE ARE A RULES ABOUT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WERE CREATED IN THE COURTS TO TEST CALLED CARRILLO. IN THE SUPREME COURT AFTER YEARS OF SEEN MISS CLASSIFICATION LAWSUITS THAT CLEARLY HAD BAD EMPLOYERS TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW. SEVEN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS UNANIMOUSLY UNANIMOUSLY CONSIDERED THIS AND SAID WE NEED A CLEAR TEST. AND THAT'S HOW WE GOT DYNAMAX. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. SINCE A YEAR AGO APRIL WHEN DYNAMAX CAME OUT. THINKING THROUGH EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF WORK THINKING THRILL OF HOW WE COULD HAVE A FRAMEWORK. OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT WE ALL KNEW DYNAMICS DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT WAS ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH INTO THEN COME TO THIS FLOOR AND SAY WE SHOULD VOTE THIS DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT ENOUGH WHEN YOU'VE NEVER EVEN COME TO MY OFFICE AND SPOKEN TO ME ABOUT THAT. KNOWING I'M WORKING ON THIS BILL ALL YEAR BEFORE. IS DISHONEST. IT'S INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST. YEAH IT'S INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY. TO SUGGEST THAT EVERY TIME THEY GO OUT THERE THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT THE POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. YET SUDDENLY WE WANT TECH COMPANIES WHERE. THE CEOS OR MAKING FORTY FIVE MILLION FORTY MILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY'RE BRINGING HOME BILLIONS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STOCK PROFITS. TO SAY WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY. TO NOT PAY WORKERS A MINIMUM WAGE AND YOU WONDER WHY THERE'S TEN CITIES IN SACRAMENTO. I'VE HAD ENOUGH. I'VE HAD ENOUGH. NOBODY WANTS TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THEY JUST WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PROBLEMS IN THAT'S DISINGENUOUS SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE A SOLUTION HERE IS IT PERFECT NOW. ARE THERE GUIDELINES YES BECAUSE WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS DECISION WE READ IT WE TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE COURT WAS COMING FROM. IT PROVIDED EXEMPTIONS THAT WORK IN THOSE FRAMEWORKS BUT SAID IT MATTERS HOW MUCH SOMEBODY MAKES AND THEIR JOB HOW MUCH LEVERAGE THEY REALLY HAVE TO BARGAIN THEIR OWN RATES. COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS. YOU'RE NOT FLEXIBLE WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE NO FLEXIBILITY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO TAKE A SIDE JOB OR THIRD GIG OR FOURTH GIG THAT'S NOT FLEXIBILITY. THAT'S FEUDALISM AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING IF WE DON'T PUT A STOP TO IT. WANTED TO STRIKE A BALANCE A BALANCE THAT PROTECTS WORKERS. IN PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE IF YOU GO IN YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOU ASK THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ABIDING BY THE LAW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST A BUSINESS THAT DOESN'T PAY PAYROLL TAXES IT DOESN'T PAY SEVEN POINT 5% INTO SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICARE FOR THE WORKERS IT DOESN'T PROVIDE A MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME THEY CAN NOT CONTINUE TO COMPETE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORKERS IT'S ABOUT LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING TODAY IN THE GYM AT LARGE BUSINESSES. WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT TODAY. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE BY BY THE LAW. AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF IT IN LEADING A NEW INDUSTRY COME IN AND SAY BECAUSE I HIRE YOU THROUGH AN APP I DON'T HAVE ANY RULES. PROVIDES IS EVERYTHING IF YOU THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREET TODAY WHAT EVERY JOB BE HIRED TO RUN OUT. AND HAVE NO RULES. THE PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD. HI TECH COMPANIES ARE LAUGHABLE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE TALK A LOT ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY YOU KNOW IT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ALLOW EVERY COMPANY TO QUIT PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR THE WORKERS. MEDICARE WE WONDER WHY SOCIAL SECURITY IS UNDERFUNDED THIRTY SECOND WEEK GIVING UP ON SOCIAL SECURITY. ARE WE GIVING UP ON WORKERS COMP ARE WE GIVING UP ON HEALTH CARE ARE WE GIVING UP ON EVERYTHING WE HAVE BUILT OVER THE LAST. FIVE SIX DECADES IN STATE IT'S OKAY THE RICH WILL BECOME RICHER AND THE POOR WILL BECOME POOR AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO SAY IT'S REALLY COOL BECAUSE I. APP ON MY PHONE. I DON'T HELLO THIS IS A PERFECT. I THINK THIS GOES A LONG WAY TO PROTECTING WORKERS LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESSES LEGITIMATE BUSINESS IS A PLAY BY THE RULES AND WE AS TAXPAYERS THAT HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE MESS WITH THESE BUSINESSES DON'T PROVIDE ENOUGH FOR THE WORKERS.

NEVER GIVE YOUR ATTENTION I'M A NUMBER MELENDEZ MELENDEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO AS A SERIES OF FOUR COORDINATED TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE CARRIED OUT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH. BY NINETEEN ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS. THESE NINETEEN TERRACE CARRIED SMUGGLED BOX CUTTERS AND KNIVES THREE SECURITY AT THREE EAST COAST AIRPORTS AS THEY BOARDED FOR EARLY MORNING FLIGHTS WHICH WERE BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA. BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA THEY CHOSE THOSE FLIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WERE LOADED DOWN WITH THE MOST FEEL THAT THEY CAN GET ON THE PLANE FOR SUCH A LONG FLIGHT. EIGHT FORTY FIVE AM AMERICAN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT LOADED WITH TWENTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF FUEL FLEW INTO THE NORTH TOWER OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER. JUST AFTER NINE AM AND UNITED AIRLINES FLIGHT FLEW INTO THE SOUTH TOWER. THEN AN AMERICAN AIRLINES FLIGHT FLEW INTO THE WEST SIDE OF THE PENTAGON NINE FORTY FIVE. IN A FOURTH CALIFORNIA BOUND PLANE. IT WAS ABOUT FORTY MINUTES AFTER TAKING OFF FROM NEWARK NEW JERSEY. THE PASSENGERS FOUGHT THE HIJACKERS BY ATTACKING THEM IN THE COCKPIT ACTUALLY WITH A FIRE EXTINGUISHER THE PLANE FLIPPED OVER SPED TOWARD THE EARTH AND CRASHED IN A FIELD NEAR SHANKSVILLE IN PENNSYLVANIA AT TEN TEN AM. PEOPLE FROM SEVENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DIED THAT DAY IN NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON DC AND PENNSYLVANIA AND ALMOST THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WERE INJURED AND MANY MORE HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES SINCE. DUE TO INJURIES RELATED TO THOSE ATTACKS SAID WHETHER IT'S CANCER OR OTHER HEALTH RELATED ILLNESSES. THESE ATTACKS HAD BEEN PLANNED FOR YEARS AND THEY WERE CARRIED OUT BECAUSE OF A DEEP HATRED FOR AMERICA FOR VALUES. AND FOR THEIR FRIENDS IN THE WORLD WE CHOOSE TO PROTECT. THE TAX DESTROYED A LOT OF LIVES IT BROKE A LOT OF HEARTS. BUT IT ALSO BROUGHT THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT I'D NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFETIME WHERE WE ALL LOCKED ARMS AND STOOD TOGETHER. TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY FOR VALUES FOR OUR FELLOW CITIZENS IT DIDN'T MATTER WHAT POLITICAL PARTY YOU WERE. WHAT COLOR YOU WERE WHERE YOU CAME FROM WE WERE ALL SOLIDLY UNITED IN EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME AGO I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT SOME OF YOU IN HERE WE'RE JUST KIDS WHEN IT HAPPENED. BUT NO MATTER HOW MANY YEARS PASS BY OR HOW OLD YOU WERE WHEN IT HAPPENS I HOPE THAT NO ONE EVER FORGETS THE MANY INNOCENT LIVES THAT WERE LOST NOT BECAUSE OF SOME DISPUTE OVER LAND BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHAT WE STAND FOR. AND REMEMBER HOW UNITED WE WERE THEN AND THAT IN IN THE END WHAT REALLY MATTERS IS TO WHERE ALL AMERICANS DESPITE OUR DIFFERENCES WE CARE ABOUT ONE ANOTHER WE PROTECT ONE ANOTHER WE STAND UP FOR ONE ANOTHER. AND. I GUESS I WOULD ASK THAT WHY THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPECTFUL ATTENTION OUR ALSO ASK WHEN THE MOMENT COMES IF WE COULD. OPEN THE FIRST ROLL UPPER CO AUTHORS THANK YOU. TAKING HIS MELENDEZ MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS LET US TAKE TIME TODAY TO REMEMBER THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE. AND TO EXTEND OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE VICTIMS AND FAMILIES ATTACKED. THAT DAY ON THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TERRORIST ATTACK THE UNITED STATES NEARLY THREE THOUSAND INNOCENT AMERICANS WERE KILLED. ON THE ATTACKS AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER THE PENTAGON AND ON FLIGHT NINETY TWO WHICH CRASHED IN THE FIELD IN PENNSYLVANIA MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL PERISHED IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE ATTACKS. IN MANY FIRST RESPONDERS ARE STILL LOOP LOSING THEIR LIVES TODAY FROM BEING EXPOSED TO THE TOXIC DEBRIS IN THE AIR. ON THIS MORNING EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO. IT DAWNED AS A BEAUTIFUL NEW YORK MORNING LIKE SO MANY FALL MORNINGS ACTUALLY THE BEST TIME OF THE YEAR TO BE IN NEW YORK THE WEATHER IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL WHEN I SAW THE PICTURES IT WAS IT WAS JUST DEVASTATING THE SEE THAT BLUE SKY AND THEN THE SMOKE WITH IT. KNOW THAT THIS MORNING WOULD BE DIFFERENT. ONE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD FOREVER THE NIGHT BEFORE HUNDREDS PREPARE FOR THEIR TRIPS PACKING BAGS THEY WOULD NEVER RE OPEN. IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN TO THE WORLD TRADE CENTER IN NEW YORK YOU WOULD KNOW THE ENORMITY OF THOSE STRUCTURES. EVERYONE WHO LIVE THERE KNEW SOMEONE WHO WORKED THERE. THE BUILDINGS WERE LIKE MANY CITIES THERE ARE LIKE THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN EACH BUILDING. TODAY I STAND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE HUNDREDS OF CLASSMATES AND FAMILY MEMBERS FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE WHO DIED THAT MORNING. INCLUDING SPECIFICALLY THAT THE ONE OF THE FIRST PERSONS TO DIE IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER CHAPLAIN MYCHAL JUDGE WHO WAS A FIRE CHAPLAIN BUT HE WAS ALSO THE CHAPLAIN AT MY HIGH SCHOOL. CAPTAIN TIMOTHY STACKPOLE WAS A CLASSMATE FROM FDNY. AND CAPTAIN VINNY G. A MONA WHO WAS JUST GETTING READY TO SERVE TO CELEBRATE HIS FORTIETH BIRTHDAY AND WAS MADE CAPTAIN THAT WEEK AT FDNY. I RAN TRACK WITH HIM HE WAS A CLASSMATE. EVERYONE CAN REMEMBER WHERE THEY WERE THAT MORNING MY SON WAS SITTING IN THE HIGH CHAIR FACING ME AS I WAS FEEDING HIM AND SOMEONE SAID OH MY GOD YOU'RE GOING TO TURN ON THE TV AND RIGHT BEHIND HIM WAS THE TV. AND ALL OF A SUDDEN AS A NEW MOM MY WHOLE PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE IN THE FUTURE WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN THIS WORLD. CHANGED. THAT ALSO MEANS THAT EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S NOW WITH THIS UP TO A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL. WAS NOT ALIVE DURING THE TIME OF THESE ATTACKS. DON'T REMEMBER AND DON'T KNOW. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT. THAT WE KEEP THAT REMEMBER TO LIVE AND TEACH THEM. SO WE EXTENDED AGAIN OUR DEEPEST SYMPATHIES TO THE THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT VICTIMS OF THIS ATTACK. AND THEIR FAMILIES. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDER HEROES. WE NEED TO LIVE EACH DAY AND NEVER MISS A CHANCE TO TELL ARE THE ONES DEAR TO US THAT WE LOVE THEM. AND THE BEST WAY WE CAN HONOR THOSE ON NINE ELEVEN. IS TO LIVE LIKE IT'S NINE TWELVE WE REMEMBER HOW THAT THEY WAS WE WERE SO UNIFOR UNIFIED TOGETHER SO. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND MAY WE NEVER FORGET. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON IS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND LIKE TO IT I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LIKE HOUSE NOR FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD. YOU'RE EIGHTEEN YEARS ON THE MEMORY OF THAT MORNING IS STILL. AS RAW AS EVER AND. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO SAID I THINK WE WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE WHEN WE HEARD THAT HORRIBLE NEWS. WE ARE LIVING RIGHT NOW IN. DIVIDED TIMES AND I THINK THAT EVEN IN TIMES LIKE THAT SOME PERHAPS ESPECIALLY IN TIMES LIKE THIS IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WE DO AT ODDS AND THAT THE TIES THAT BIND US TOGETHER MUCH STRONGER THAN ANY OF THE FORCES THAT ARE SEEKING TO TEAR US APART. SEC THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD LET'S NEVER FORGET. THE MORNING OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND LET'S NEVER FORGET THAT EACH AND EVERY PERSON. EACH AND EVERY EFFECT WAS AN AMERICAN FIRST AND FOREMOST THANK YOU. TAKEN IS BETWEEN NORTHWEST PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER MEMBERS UP. WE THROW. THE WORD HERO AROUND A LOT. AND SOMETIMES IT'S% DESERVED AND SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A AT AN EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION BUT IT EXAGGERATES THE NOTION. OF HEROISM. AND NINE ELEVEN REALLY DOES BRING HOME WHAT HEROES DO AND WHO THEY ARE. WE SAW OUR FIRST RESPONDERS WHILE PEOPLE WERE RUNNING AWAY FOR THEIR LIVES THEY WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE HORROR. KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THEY MAY VERY WELL RISK THEIR OWN LIVES FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THAT'S REALLY HER ROLE WAKE. WE WITNESSED ANOTHER. ACT OF HEROISM WHEN THOSE. INDIVIDUALS IN FLIGHT NINETY THREE. TOGETHER SAID LET'S ROLL. AND THEY DID SOMETHING VERY HEROIC AND THEY KNEW. AT THE TIME THEY DID IT. THAT THEY WERE RISKING THEIR LIVES. AND SO I THINK IT REMINDS US ALSO OF. THOSE AMONGST US DO THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE IMAGINE. WE MIGHT HOPEFULLY TO. IF CALLED UPON AND YET WHO REALLY KNOWS. I THINK THIS IS A TIME TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION HOW SHOULD WE THEN LIVE BEING GIVEN SUCH A WITNESS. AND IT IS A TIME TO REMEMBER I THINK IT'S ALSO A TIME TO THINK VERY SERIOUSLY. WHAT WOULD WE DO AT A MOMENT THAT TESTED OUR SOULS TO BECOME THE PEOPLE WE HOPE. WE CAN BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON IS OUR QUE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I TWO ONE I THINK OUR COLLEAGUE MIKE ELSINORE FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO SAID THEY REMEMBER WHERE THEY WERE THAT DAY. I WAS THE LAW STUDENT I WAS MY FIRST BOOK OF LAW SCHOOL. CAPITOL HILL IN WASHINGTON DC. WATCH IT ON THE TELEVISION IDN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND WAS GOING ON SO I WENT TO CLASS. WELL AS MANY OF YOU KNOW HOW THEY EVACUATED. CAPITOL HILL AND IT WAS A SCENE LIKE NONE I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. WE WATCHED THE SMOKE COMING OFF THE PENTAGON. PEOPLE WERE RUNNING FROM THEIR CARS BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET OUT FAST ENOUGH BECAUSE THE PLANE THAT WENT DOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA WAS RUMORED TO BE HEADED OUR WAY. THE FEAR THAT EACH OF US FELT THAT DAY. AND THE HEROES WHO CAME TO OUR AID. TO PROTECT EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND TO FIGHT FOR ALL THE LIVES THAT THEY COULD. IN THE TWIN TOWERS IN NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE. WAS AMAZING. ANDIN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED BEING IN WASHINGTON AND BEING ON CAPITOL HILL WATCHING AS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN. THAT WE KNEW THAT THE VALUES THAT EACH OF US COMES HERE EVERY DAY TO PROTECT WERE UNDER ATTACK. AND THAT WE WOULD STAND STRONG. IN THOSE VALUES WAS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REMEMBER ALWAYS TO HOLD ON TO. AND AS WE HAVE VIGOROUS DEBATES TODAY AND THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE KNOW THAT EACH OF US. HOLDS DEAR THE VALUES OF THIS COUNTRY. AND THE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THAT IS WHAT WE'RE FIGHTING FOR AND TO PROTECT. AND SO I WANTED TO RISE TODAY TO REMEMBER THAT FEELING BECAUSE I KNOW THE VIGOROUS DEBATES WILL CONTINUE. BUT WE ARE UNITED AND IN THE MEMORY OF THOSE THAT WERE LOST WITH CONTINUED TO HOLD THOSE VALUES DEAR. ME EACH OF THEIR MEMORIES BE A BLESSING. FIGURES BARRICADE HAND DOCTOR CHOI YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU SPEAKER. AND THE NORTH SAW SOME OF THE MEMBER MELENDEZ OF FOR BRINGING UP BUT THIS AT AGE OF SIXTY ONE LET ME ASK A FEW OF MY THOUGHTS. EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO TODAY AMERICA WAS SHOT. FOR THAT MATTER THE WORLD WAS SHOCKED. TO WATCH THE CRUMBLING TWIN TOWERS. THE PROUD THE SYMBOL OF AMERICAN WELL'S TO HAND THE PERHAPS OF THE SYMBOL BOOK CAPTORS. IT WAS SO A WAKEUP CALL TO AMERICA. WE WERE NOT. SAVEFILE AS WE THOUGHT. AND THE FROM THEIR OWN. OUR LIFESTYLES HAVE PERMANENTLY CHANGED. WE CAN EVEN ARE TAKEN ON OPEN THE BOTTLE OF. WATER BEYOND THE SECURITY POINT. BUT THE NO ONE COMPLAINS BECAUSE A WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THE TIMES I HAVE CHANGED AND ON OUR SAFETY IS A MORE IMPORTANT. ALL OF THE INCONVENIENCES. ON THE OTHER HAND HOW SOON ARE WE FORGET. HAD HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH OF TWO THOUSAND ONE. SOME INCLUDING US SOME GOVERNMENT LEADERS THINK A WE ARE SAFE WITH THE EVEN WITH YOU OPEN BORDERS. WHICH SHOT ANYONE CAN CROSS. WE WILL NOT KNOW WHO'S CROSSING OUR BORDERS. WE WOULD NOT KNOW IF A FEW OF THEM ARE OUR ENEMIES ONE. LIKE THOSE SO WHO ATTACKED THE TWIN TOWERS. ONCE THEY ACROSS THE BORDER SO CALLED THE SANCTUARY CITIES SANCTUARY US STATES ARE LIKE CALIFORNIA WOULD WELCOME THEM WITH OPEN ARMS AND THE- FOOD AND SHELTER. HOW SOON DO WE FOR GAS. THAT THOUGHT ONE ONE HALF OF THE WAR THE POPULATION HATES AMERICA. NINE ELEVEN REMINDS US THAT THAT. NINE ELEVEN REMINDERS THAT THE IT IS SO OUR LAST TO WAKEUP CALL AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO AND ON THE ONE. YES SIR IT IS TIME TO REMEMBER AT THE INNOCENT VICTIM SO AND THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE THE FIRST RESPONDENTS. WHO ALSO VANISHED THE TOGETHER. BUT WE CAN JUST A TO L. UPON THE IS CHARLES AND A TRAGIC MOMENT AMERICA MUST OUR LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE OUR OF THE TRAGIC NINE ELEVEN. WE SHOULD ASK AT THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS. HOW CAN WE BE SURE OF ON THE WHOLE REPEAT OFF ON NINE ELEVEN. WHO ARE OUR ENEMIES. HOW CAN WE SURVIVE AS A NATION. WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AS A NATION. GOD BLESS AMERICA. THIS MESSAGE SHE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM LIKE ELSINORE FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT RESOLUTION TO OUR FLOOR AND I ALSO JOIN ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES IN HONORING AND REMEMBERING ALL THE VICTIMS ALL THE OR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND ALL THOSE. WHO DEMONSTRATED OUR. WHICH IS AN ODD TO OUR COUNTRY IN RESPONSE TO NINE ELEVEN. YOU KNOW WHEN NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED. THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE THAT COMPARED THIS FIRST TERRORIST ATTACK ON AMERICAN SOIL. A PEARL HARBOUR. AND. PEARL HARBOR. RESONATES IN A VERY SPECIAL WAY WITH THE JAPANESE AMERICAN COMMUNITY BECAUSE. ON THE ONE HAND WE KNOW THAT. AN ENEMY IS ATTACKING AMERICANS ON AMERICAN SOIL. BUT IT'S ALSO ANOTHER IMPORTANT LESSON OF NINE ELEVEN IS THAT WE REMEMBER. TO DISTINGUISH THE ENEMIES THAT ATTACK US. FROM. LOYAL AMERICANS WHETHER OF JAPANESE ANCESTRY. FOLLOWING WORLD WAR TWO OR LOYAL MUSLIM AMERICANS. THAT. WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T ENGAGED AND RACIAL PROFILING OR RACIAL STEREOTYPING. AS A RESPONSE TO DID THESE DRAMATIC EVENTS. AND I ASK THAT WE. ALSO REMEMBER THAT AS AN IMPORTANT LESSON OF NINE ELEVEN. MEMBERS OF YOUR SPEAK ON THE RESOLUTION PLEASE PUT YOUR MIKE SEVEN UNSCHOOLING YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I A AND MOVED JUST BECAUSE THIS IS JUST I LISTED MY CALLERS TODAY MY COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE BRING THIS BEFORE US. ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO REFLECTED UPON THE ROLE OF HEROISM ON THAT DAY. AND I SIT HERE UNDERNEATH THE PICTURE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN. AND THE THINGS I SORT OF PUT TOGETHER OF COURSE IS DAYS LIKE THIS OUR DAYS REMEMBER THOSE WHO PASSED AWAY THIS REALLY FOR THE PRESENT WE LIVE AS MY COLLEAGUE IS EMPHASIZED OUR RELATIONS ONE WITH ANOTHER. AND. SO MUCH OF AMERICAN CIVIC LIFE IS ACTUALLY BOUND UP IN LOOKING AT HEROISM FROM AFAR. THE STOPPER FORTY POINT THAT'S ACTUALLY THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER. IS A SONG ABOUT LOOKING AT HEROISM FROM AFAR IS FRANCIS SCOTT KEY WAS IN THE HARBOR LOOKING THROUGH THE NIGHT AT THE AMERICAN FLAG AS WOULD. FLASH IN THE LIGHT MOMENTARILY. SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE HAIR WAS AND IT WAS THERE. AND ON THIS DAY WE REMEMBER THE HEROES OF NINE ELEVEN. AND IT I CONNECTED TO ABRAHAM LINCOLN AS HE. WENT TO HIS FIRST INAUGURAL. WITH AMERICA IN GREAT CONFLICT. AND WHAT A CONUNDRUM TO SEE AN AMERICA THAT WAS STILL YOUNG. THIS CONCEPT OF A UNION. AND COMING APART AT THE SEAMS. THE BUNDLE OF STICKS WHICH IS SO UBIQUITOUS ON MY LABEL IS ON THE FRONT OF HIS CHAIR IN THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL. ON BOTH SIDES PRETTY TO CHANCE BECAUSE HE KEPT AMERICA FROM FLYING APART. WHICH IS SORT OF OUR CHALLENGE IN OUR AREA. BUT ABRAHAM LINCOLN FACED WITH THIS CONUNDRUM. OF HOW DO WE BRING BACK. FIND THE CENTER OF AMERICA AS HE WENT TO HIS INAUGURAL. AS WE ARE DOING HERE HE REFLECTED UPON HEROISM VIEWED FROM AFAR. AND CHALLENGES LISTENERS TO THINK ABOUT OUR CONNECTION TO OTHER HEROES. AND A RECENT OURSELVES AND SO ON THE STAIRS WE HONOR THIS PERMISSION TO READ THESE THE CONCLUDING REMARKS OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN THAT I SORT OF RELATE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO POINT OUT THAT. WE HAVE A SPECIAL REGARD FOR THESE HEROES. MY PHONE SET UP SO I APOLOGIZE AS I PROCEED. I AM LOATH TO CLOSE. WE ARE NOT ENEMIES BUT FRIENDS. WE MUST NOT BE ENEMIES. THOUGH PASSION MAY HAVE STRAINED. IT MUST NOT BREAK OUR BONDS OF AFFECTION OF COURSE BECAUSE OF THE AMERICAN UNION. THE MYSTIC CHORDS OF MEMORY. STRETCHING FROM EVERY BATTLE FIELD AND PATRIOT GRAVE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS BACK ON CONCURRENCE. THE TENANT PROTECTION. CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE ONE RENT INCREASE AWAY FROM ADDICTIONS AND FROM HOMELESSNESS. ON BEHALF OF OUR JOINT AUTHORS I WANT TO THANK THE ORIGINAL COALITION OF TENANT PROGRESSIVE INEQUITY ADVOCATES AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS WHO RECENTLY JOINED AFTER SENATE AMENDMENTS BY STAKEHOLDERS FROM OUR BUSINESS VETERANS AND RENTAL HOUSING COMMUNITY. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT AND THANK AND ACKNOWLEDGE LEADERSHIP OF HONOR. ARE SENATE PRO TOWN AND OF COURSE OUR SPEAKER. THIS BILL WILL PREVENT EGREGIOUS RENT GOUGING AND PREDATORY EVICTIONS WHILE STRIKING A BALANCE TO ALLOW LANDLORDS TO MAKE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN. THERE TO CRITICAL PROTECTIONS FOR TENANTS THAT ARE STYLISH UNDER THIS BILL FIRST A RENT CAP FOR ANNUAL RENT INCREASES. AT THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX PLUS FIVE PERCENT. AND SECONDLY JUST BECAUSE PRODUCTIONS THAT REQUIRE LANDLORDS DECIDE A REASON BEFORE VICTIMS SOMEONE. I'M GONNA TAKE A MOMENT TO BRIEFLY ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS THAT ARE TYPICALLY ASKED ABOUT THIS BILL FIRST WILL IT IMPACT HOUSING PRODUCTION. ARBIL EXPLICITLY EXEMPTS NEW CONSTRUCTION FOR FIFTEEN YEARS. WE APPRECIATE THAT CIA BELIEVES THAT THIS WILL NOT IMPEDE CONSTRUCTION. IS CP I WAS FIVE THE APPROPRIATE CAP. THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY IS REPRESENTED BY CAA DOES NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL KNOWING THAT LANDLORDS CAN MAKE A FAIR RATE OF RETURN ON A CAP THAT'S MORE THAN DOUBLE OR STATES YEARLY MEDIAN RENT INCREASE. WILL IT IMPACT THE REALTOR INDUSTRY. OUR BILL NO LONGER APPLIES TO THE VAST MAJORITY OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND OWNER OCCUPIED DUPLEXES THE BREAD AND BUTTER OF THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY. AND SHOULD WE BE IN PRODUCING HOUSING. WHAT ALL OF US WHO MAKE UP THE SEVERAL DOZEN AUTHORS ON THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING BUT UNTIL WE BUILD THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION UNITS THAT WILL STABILIZE OUR STATE'S HOUSING PRICES WE NEED TO HELP CALIFORNIANS STAY IN THERE LONG TIME HOMES. IN A BEST CASE SCENARIO IT WILL TAKE WELL OVER A DECADE TO BUILD THAT HOUSING WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE A TEN YEAR SUNSET DATE. AS MILLIONS OF. STRUGGLING IN THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. WE NEED TO STAND UP AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER BLOOM YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS SO I'M JUST TOOK. AN HOUR OR SO AGO ON THIS FLOOR. WE VOTED AND I THINK IT TOUGH PULLED DOES SOMEWHERE NORTH OF FIFTY VOTES. TO ALLOW FOR SAFE PARKING ZONES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IN CALIFORNIA ON HOUSING WE ARE FINDING WAYS TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS. IF THAT DOESN'T UNDERSCORE WHERE WE ARE WITH THIS HOUSING CRISIS AND THE NEED TO PROTECT TENANTS AND BUILD MORE HOUSING. SO THAT THE CAPACITY IS THERE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES. FOLKS YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO PAY. 506070% OF THEIR NET SPENDABLE INCOME ON RENT. BECAUSE LANDLORDS ARE RAISING THE RANTS AND THAT'S WHAT TENANTS ARE FACED WITH WHAT'S SOMEONE TO DO IN THAT SITUATION. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL IT'S A BILL THAT'S BEEN NEGOTIATED. WE HAVE NOT PASSED SIGNIFICANT TENANT PROTECTION MEASURES UNTIL THIS SESSION AND THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO DO SOMETHING FOR TENANTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SOME MODICUM OF PROTECTION. BECAUSE THE HOUSING THAT WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THEM IS GOING TO TAKE TIME TO BUILD DOWN IN IN THAT THIS GAG REGION AND SO THE CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF GOVERNMENTS THEY'VE JUST BEEN TOLD BY EIGHT CD THAT THEY NEED TO BUILD ONE POINT THREE MILLION. HOUSING UNITS. OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S A TALL ORDER CALIFORNIA FORWARD SAYS THAT TO BUILD THAT KIND OF HOUSING IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT WE CAN DO IT WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS OR SO AND WE OUGHT TO BE THINKING EVEN LONGER TERM. SO THE- IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO MODERATE THE INCREASES AND RENT WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUALLY FACED WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS IT'S THAT SIMPLE AND IT'S NOT JUST HOMELESS THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT. IT'S OUR FAMILIES IT'S ARE FOR AND THERE'S NO ONE IN THIS. DOES NOT NO MAN IS NOT JUST. BUT MANY PEOPLE PROBABLY MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE KNOW WHO ARE AFFECTED BY THE RISING COST OF HOUSING WHETHER IT'S YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR PARENTS OR YOUR FRIENDS YOU KNOW WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE UGH THE MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND FOR THE CORD WHO HAVE LABORED MANY MANY HOURS TO CRAFT A COMPROMISE ON THIS BILL. OF THE TIME IS COME TO DO SOMETHING TO TECH TENANTS I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. MR YOUR RECOGNIZE THANK YOU MISTER NUMBERS I RISE TODAY AS A JOINT AUTHOR OF ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THE HOUSING CRISIS IS NOT SIMPLY AN ACADEMIC ISSUE THEY CAN BE REDUCED TO FACTS FIGURES AND SPREADSHEETS. IT IS A HUMAN ISSUE. IT IS PRESENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN WE PASSED BY PARKING LOTS WERE FAMILY SLEEP WITH THEIR CHILDREN IN CARS. IT CONFRONTS US WHEN WE LEAVE THE CAPITAL IN THE EVENING AND SEE PEOPLE SETTING UP CAMP IN THE PARK NOT ONE HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE NOW STAND. ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT TENANTS FACE ACROSS OUR STATE TO ME AT LEAST IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE. AB FOURTEEN TWO IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE TO OUR STATES. CRISIS OF HOUSING PORTABILITY AND HOMELESSNESS PROTECTING VULNERABLE TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT BY OUTRAGEOUS RATE HIKES AND AN EPIC EVICTIONS. EVERY LANDLORD AND PROPERTY OWNER SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE RENTAL PROPERTIES WAY THAT THEY'D NESS. THIS MEANS THAT RENTERS TO BREAK THE ALL WERE SEIZE PAYING RENT CAN BE OF. OWNERS OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OWNERS OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS CAN MOVE INTO THEIR PROPERTIES AND UNITS CAN BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET IF IT MAKES ECONOMIC SENSE. ALL OF THESE THINGS REMAIN UNTOUCHED AND UNAFFECTED BY EIGHT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO DEVELOPERS THEY NEED LONG TERM CERTAINTY AND THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT CAPITAL IF THEY'RE GOING TO BUILD A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF HOUSE. WE NEED TO MEET OUR PRODUCT GOALS. FOURTEEN TO NOW FIFTEEN YOUR NEW CONSTRUCTION EXEMPTS. SURE THAT WE DON'T HINDER NEW DEVELOPMENT. BUT JUST AS LANDLORDS AND DEVELOPERS NEED CERTAINTY AND STABILITY IN ORDER TO DO BUSINESS. FAMILIES NEED AND DESERVE THE SAME CERTAINTY IN ORDER TO THRIVE. THEY DESERVE THE TO HAVE THE STABILITY IN THE PLACE THAT THEY CALL HOME THE PLACE THAT THEY PUT THEIR KIDS TO BETTER. IT IS SIR HOW MUCH RENT CAN IT WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF A- OF TIME. THEY DESERVE TO KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE THAT THEY WILL NOT BE A VERY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY LOVE OR THE GOD THAT THEY PRAY TO. WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH MEMBERS OF THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY. PRESENTED IS FROM TEN TO ADVOCACY GROUPS TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THEIR LEGITIMATE INTEREST. YOU ALL KNOW THAT WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS DECADES IN THE MAKING. THIS BODY IS POISED TO AVOID MANY FOR THIS THIS BODY IS POISED TO ADVANCE ITS MEANING FOR MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS JUST HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. ENTERING COULD INCREASE PRODUCTION TO THE HIGH LEVELS THAT WE NEED TO REACH IN ORDER TO MAKE PROGRESS ON OUR BACKLOG. BUT PRODUCTION ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH TO WRITE OUR CONSTITUENTS WITH RELIEF FROM THE UNCERTAINTY AND- **** BY OUR LACK OF A MORE HOUSING. OF CALIFORNIA. THE THEM IN THEIR HOMES AND THEY NEED THEM NOW THERE IS A WAY FOR LANDLORDS TO DO BUSINESS FOR TENNIS TO HAVE MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS AT THE SAME TIME BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE CAN COME TOGETHER TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE ACHIEVED THAT COMPROMISE WITH THE BILL COLLEAGUES I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT PROVIDING RELIEF TO THE DEVELOP INTO STRUGGLE HOUSING COSTS. I KNOW YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE POVERTY ALL STREET THEN THE I ASK YOU TODAY THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PROTECTION FOR ME OF CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS TO ADDRESS OUR PRODUCTION AND AFFORDABLE. CRISIS. THANK YOU MISS GRAYSON. MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I A STROKE STRONGLY URGE A NO VOTE ON AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. WE ALL KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AN UNACCEPTABLE HOUSING AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL WILL JUST POUR FUEL ON THE FIRE. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE IMPACTS OF THIS RENT CONTROL SCHEME PREEMPTIVE RENT INCREASES IMPOSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON LEASES AND THE SLOWDOWN IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF BADLY NEEDED NEW HOMES. FOR DECADES NOW CALIFORNIA'S IMPOSE MORE MORE RESTRICTIONS AND MANDATES ON BUILDERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS WHY WOULD ANYONE LOOK TO INVEST IN MULTI FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING NOW IN FACT A LOT OF THE RENTAL HOUSING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND MY DISTRICT IS. WAS BUILT BACK THIRTY YEARS AGO OR FORTY YEARS AGO THEY'VE BEEN RENOVATED BUT THEY'RE STILL RENTAL HOUSING AND ALL OF THOSE WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL. AND FOR DECADES NOW THE PROBLEM HAS GOTTEN WORSE. WHY ON EARTH WOULD WE EXPECT THINGS TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND. EVERY TIME A BILL LIKE THIS COMES UP YOU'RE WARNED OF THE IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON A RENTAL MARKETS. AND EVERY TIME THOSE WARNINGS FALL ON DEAF EARS AND THIS WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AGAIN TODAY. SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES ALREADY HAVE RENT CONTROL AND MANY OF THOSE CITIES HAVE THE ABSOLUTE WORST HOUSING CONDITIONS IN THE STATE. THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE DON'T CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE RENTERS WILL BE PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT FROM THE BACKLASH AGAINST RENT CONTROL. IF WE WANT TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ARE WE JUST NUMBER OF REGULATIONS IMPOSE SOME BUILDERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS. ICE CONTROLS AND GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED ECONOMY HAVE FAILED TO DELIVER RESULTS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THIS BILL WILL TOO I STRONGLY URGE IN THE VOTE. THEY MISS WALDRON MEMBERS PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES WE'D LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE MISTER RODRIGUEZ YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AS I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THIS BILL TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE RENT INCREASES THIS IS A HUGE COMPLEX ISSUE. NOT EFFORT AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO WORK ON HOUSING SUPPLY WHICH IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS IN OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AS I STRUGGLE WITH THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE THIS BODY TO HAVE A SERIOUS CONVERSATION NEXT YEAR REGARDING INCREASE IN OUR HOUSING SUPPLY ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU. THEY MUST RODRIGUEZ IS BOERNER HORVATH YOUR RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES TODAY I RISE TO ENCOURAGE SUPPORT FOR FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO AND YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED BECAUSE WHEN THIS BILL CAME TO THE FLOOR LAST TIME I WAS A STRONG EARLY NO VOTE. BUT THIS IS NOT THE SAME BILL THAT BILL WAS TOO EXTREME FOR ME WENT TOO FAR AND SMACKED OF RENT CONTROL. AND NOW WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS BILL THIS BILL IS A SOLID SOLUTION THAT WE NEED TIME ARE THAT. A SOLID SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEMS NOW WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME. WE'RE DONE. IN MY DISTRICT I HAD A REPORT LAST WEEK. OF THE FAMILY WERE BOTH PARENTS WERE WORKING TWO JOBS. AND THEY WERE IN THE HOMELESS SHELTER. THIS IS A MY DISTRICT GUYS. EVER THE MY DISTRICT IT'S IN EVERYBODY'S DISTRICT. SO WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO SOMEONE INCREASE SUPPLY AND WHEN WE DO INCREASE SUPPLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE IN PRESET THOUGHTFULLY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND NOT BE DOING STATE MANDATES SO THAT'S EVEN HARDER. SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO TO PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORS ARE FAMILIES NOW. AND THERE ARE THINGS I DON'T LIKE IN THIS BILL BUT I'M VERY THANKFUL TO THE AUTHORS AND EVERYBODY IS WORK ON THIS BILL BE FOR TAKING SO MANY OF MY AMENDMENTS THAT I'VE ASKED FOR. WHICH IS WHY I'M SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. SO VERY HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST MENTIONED. ON HOW TO INCREASE THAT HOUSING SUPPLY THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH NEIGHBORHOODS. AS WELL SO THAT WHEN THIS BILL DOES SUNSET. IT'S DONE AND WE DON'T HAVE A NEED FOR IT. I'D URGE YOUR AYE THAT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS BOERNER HORVATH. THIS BILL AND AS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. A LOT OF ORDER BUT OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER. SPEAKER THIS BILL IS AN END RUN BY THE AUTHOR BECAUSE THE PROPOSITION FOR RENT CONTROL FAILED. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS IS RENT CONTROL YOU CAN CHANGE THE WORDING ALL YOU WANT BUT THIS IS RENT CONTROL AND IT IS FASCINATING TO ME TO LISTEN TO MEMBERS ON THIS WAR TALK ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO LIVING CALIFORNIAN HOW THERE ARE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND BUT YET THEY'RE WORKING TWO JOBS AND WE HAVE BILLS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR ARS IN PARKING LOTS AND- AND ALLOW CALTRANS TO MAKE UNDER PASSES IN UPPER PASSES. HOMELESS SHELTERS AND THEN YOU ACCESS IT IN THE POLICY DID YOU PUT IN PLACE ARE THE REASON WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE YET YOU'RE ALL ACTING SURPRISE LIKE GOSH I DON'T KNOW WHY AND HOW THIS HAPPENED HOW DO WE GET SOME LIKE SO MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE WHY CAN'T PEOPLE AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. BECAUSE YOU'VE INCREASE THE COST OF WATER THE COST OF WHAT YOU'RE CITY BECAUSE THE BASS. BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS OF RENT. EVERYTHING. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO ACTUAL PRICE. THE PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE HERE. AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA CAM AND YOU'RE GOING TO ACT LIKE THE SAVIORS THE VERY PEOPLE WHO CREATED THE PROBLEM. YOU'RE NOW GOING TO WALTZ IN AND TRY TO CONVINCE EVERYBODY THAT YOU ARE THE SAVIORS. OF ALL THAT AILS MAN THAT'S RICH. REALLY. THIS IS RENT CONTROL. AND LET ME JUST REMIND YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THE BASIC CONCEPT OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND PLEASE GOOGLE IT. OKAY IT'LL TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IF YOU DECREASE THE SUPPLY THE DEMAND IS GREATER YOU HAVE LESS OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT. AND IT'S A HIGHER COST. THE NOTION THAT WE CAN'T BECAUSE I HEARD A COUPLE PEOPLE SAY THIS THAT WE CAN'T BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS YES WE CAN. ONE THAT. WE CAN BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF IT IF WE ALLOW POLICIES TO GO IN PLACE. TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. IT'S NOT A MATTER OF CAN'T IT IS A MATTER OF WON'T. WE NEED MORE HOUSING WE NEED MORE SINGLE FAMILY HOMES WHO NEED MORE APARTMENTS WE NEED MORE EVERYTHING. SET THERE'S ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE THAT NEED SHELTER. AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SHELTER IN THEIR CAR IN A PARKING LOT IN LA. WHICH IS SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'VE COME UP WITH. WE CAN BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS IF YOU ALLOW IT. BUT WE HAVE CERTAIN SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS WHO DON'T WANT ALLOW IT AND YOU ALL GO ALONG WITH IT SO NOW YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND PRETEND. THAT YOU ARE THAT THE KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOR WRITING IN ON YOUR WORST TO SAVE EVERYONE FROM THE HIGH RENTAL COST. BUT THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN I WOULD ORIGINAL ABOUT. THIS MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER YOU KNOW THIS IS A- BOIL IT ALL DOWN IT'S A FAIR MEASURE AND WHAT WE DO EVERY DAY WE MAKE THAT ON THIS FLOOR. IS GONNA DO MORE HARM. OR MORE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE CONSTITUENTS THAT'S WHAT EVERY VOTE THAT WE PRESS HERE. REALLY IT IS IT'S A FORMULA WE'RE THINKING. THE RISK IN THE REWARD. AND THIS REALLY IS AS A FAIR DEAL AND IT'S ALREADY OUTLINED BY OUR AUTHORED OTHERS SPEAKERS AT ALL. I'LL I'LL GET INTO THAT IT REALLY PER TAXED TENANTS WE'LL TALK ABOUT GATHERING IN A SECOND. IT STABILIZES THE RENTAL HOUSING MARKET. AND IT'S VERY REASONABLE FOR PROPERTY OWNERS. IT'S NOT RENT CONTROL IT'S NOT LOOK IN NEW YORK IN IN DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WHERE THEY HAVE THE SMALL INCREASES. THAT REALLY COULD UPSET THE APPLE CART AS FAR AS SUPPLY I'VE I'VE PROBABLY WILL NOT SUPPORT THOSE MEASURES. BUT HAVING A MEASURE WERE YOU CAN GO UP 28% AN INCREASE. IS TOTALLY REASONABLE AND THE EXEMPTIONS FOR EXEMPTING NEW HOUSING. FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN YEARS EXEMPTING DUPLEXES SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING FRANKLY MOST OF THAT. THE MAIN STREET TYPE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE RENTAL HOUSING INDUSTRY THE BIG CORPORATIONS WHO WOULD HAVE THE MIST AT STAKE. THEY'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THERE ARE OPPOSED SO THE MEASURES THAT WE HAVE IN HERE AS FAR AS IMPACTING. SMALL OWNERS ARE FRANKLY VERY FAIR AND I WOULD KNOW FIRST HAND. BECAUSE MY FUND TO PAY FOR MY LITTLE GIRLS COLLEGE FUND. IS ON THREE UNITS I HAVE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A GOOD RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT HAVING IT UP TO AN 8% INCREASE IN YOUR RENT. YOU ARE A POOR PROPERTY OWNERS YOU CAN DO THE REPAIRS BE FAIR TO YOUR TENANTS. AND HAVE A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL. EARLIER I TALKED ABOUT. THE HARM IN THE GOOD EVERY TIME WE PRESS THESE BUTTONS. WE KNOW THAT RAN GALGIANI. HAS ITS IMPACT WE'VE HEARD STORY AFTER STORY OF INDIVIDUALS HAVING A TWENTY THIRTY FORTY SOMETIMES A 50% INCREASE IN THE RENT. IT'S JUST NOT FAIR AND IT'S MORE LIKELY THEY'RE GONNA END UP HERE. ON K. STREET MALL OR MAYBE THEY WILL BE HOMELESS BUT THEY'LL PUT THEY'LL GO DOWN TO THE LOWER INCOME HOUSING THAT PERSON WILL GET SQUEEZED DOWN TO THE SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY HOUSING AND THAT PERSONAL BE LEFT OUT HERE SLEEPING ON K. STREET MALL SO THERE IS A REAL CORRELATION. AS WE KNOW RESEARCH SHOWS EVERY 10% INCREASE IN RENT IN A METROPOLITAN AREA CORRELATES TO A 9% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS THE FAX JUST A SPEAK FOR OUR SELF. HERE IN SACRAMENTO MY HOME TOWN HERE RIGHT GREW UP WHERE I WAS A YOUNG STAFF MEMBER AND I CAN'T BELIEVE. I THE SALARY VERY COMPARABLE TO WHAT OUR LEGENDS ALLEGE DIRECTORS HERE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST CAME OF THIS PLACE AND MY LITTLE APARTMENT HERE MY SHARE THE RENTS. UNDER DOLLARS A MONTH. THAT WAS MY SHARE OF THAT LITTLE HOW. TWO DOLLARS A MONTH NO WAY. WE ARE SQUEEZING YOUNG PEOPLE OUT AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A FAIR RENTAL HOUSING MARKET AND MAKE SURE YOU DON'T UPSET THE APPLE CART TOO MUCH IN SACRAMENTO LAST SEVEN YEARS THE AVERAGE RENT HERE IN THE CENTRAL CITY. HAS INCREASED BY HAVE NOT INCREASED BY THAT MUCH ANNUAL WAGES FOR PEOPLE AND STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE IT NOT INCREASE THAT MUCH. AND THIS IS A FAIR MEASURE THAT WILL PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY PROTECT. RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS AND HELP TENANTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. AMOS REGARDING MS QUIRK SILVA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR EVERY DAY BUT TYPICALLY AT THIS TIME OF OUR SESSION WE GRAPPLE WITH DECISIONS THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL WE CAN BE CONFLICTED MEANING WE SEE BOTH SIDES OF AN ARGUMENT WE CA AND LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION AND WE LISTENED TO THOSE THAT SUPPORT AND SOMETIMES IN MY CASE LIKE AN ORANGE COUNTY THESE CHOICES ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. WE HAVE NO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE RENT CONTROL IN ORANGE COUNTY SO THIS CERTAINLY WOULD BE A CHANGE. FOR LEGISLATOR TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR I'VE NOT ONLY BEEN LISTENING I'VE BEEN WATCHING AND SEEN AND AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED NOT ONLY ON THIS FLOOR IN THIS CITY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOW SEEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH NOT ONLY HOMELESSNESS BUT BEING VERY CLOSE TO BEING HOMELESS. BY BEING ON ABLE TO AFFORD THE RENT IN FULLER TWO AND WE HAD TO CITIES FULLER TEN AND ANAHEIM WHERE THE COUNCILS WERE. HAD MANY MANY CONSTITUENTS COME BECAUSE A LANDLORD RAISE THE RENT ABOUT MOBILE HOMES NOW MOBILE HOMES ARE EXEMPTED FROM THIS BUT THEY CAME INTO THE COUNCIL WEEK AFTER WEEK TO TRY TO GET RELIEF MANY OF THESE CONSTITUENTS WERE VETERANS SENIORS IN HAD MOVED IN FEELING LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. NOW THEIR PLAN IS WHAT DO WE DO NOW. THEY HAVE A LITTLE REPRIEVE BECAUSE THE COUNCIL WORKED WITH THEM BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE THIS SO WE ARE NOT ONLY IN A HOMELESS CRISIS WHAT WERE IN A HOUSING CRISIS AND WE HAVE THE MORAL. AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT AND DO IT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT IS NOT EASY. I WON'T GO AS FAR AS SAYING THERE'S THREATS BUT THERE ARE THREATS. DOING WHAT IS SAFE IS WHAT IS EASY. AND DOING WHAT IS TOUGH. TAKES COURAGE IN SOMETIMES COURAGE IS HARD TO FIND. I KNOW I LIKE BEING A LEGISLATOR. BUT I WANT TO SEE PEOPLE HOUSE MORE THAN I CARE ABOUT BEING A LEGISLATOR WHEN I WALK OUTSIDE AND I KNOW. BECAUSE I'VE COUNTED THERE ARE PEOPLE LIVING ON THIS. THIS GREAT PARK THAT ARE HOMELESS WE KNOW THAT I SEE NO THE SERGEANTS KNOW THAT I KNOW THE POLICE KNOW THAT I SEE THEM IN THE MORNING IN THE SAME PLACE. FOLDING UP THEIR BLANKETS. HEARING THERE TWO BACKPACKS THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE HOMELESS AND WE HAVE ACTED THIS YEAR WE'VE ACTED ON ON EVERYTHING FROM SAFE PARKING TO AID YOU YOU EIGHTY USE THOSE ARE TOOLS BUT IT WON'T BE ONE ASPECT IT WON'T BE ONE BILL IT WILL TAKE MULTIPLE. TYPES OF LEGISLATION AND IT WILL TAKE YOUR WILL. I TALKED TO MY GREAT MENTOR WHO DOESN'T KNOW SHE'S MY MENTOR BUT DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER AS WE WALKED BY SOME HOMELESS AS WE WERE COMING BACK FROM THE CAPITAL AND I SAID. WHAT CAN WE DO AND SHE SAID IT ON THE FLOOR YESTERDAY SHE SAID I TRAVELED TO AUSTRALIA AND I ASKED THEM WHAT WHY DID THEY NOT HAVE THE SAME SITUATION WE HAVE AND THEY SAID BECAUSE THEY MADE A DECISION. TO ACT AND THEY HAVE THE WILL SO I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO FOR A SOLUTION IT MAY NOT BE PERFECT AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY BUT IT IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS AND WE DON'T ACT WE STAY IN THE SAME PLACE. AND WE NEED TO ACT BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL BE HERE. A YEAR FROM NOW TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES BUT WITH MORE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS SO I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS QUIRK SILVA MEMBERS TO BE LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DEBATE PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. MR MURATSUCHI. THAT'S A TOUGH VOTE FOR ME. IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF MY CONSTITUENTS. HAVE BECOME REALTORS IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS. BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IN ALL THE REALTORS. THAT HAVE BEEN CALLING ME AND TWEETING ME AND EMAILING ME THAT ALL BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING THAT THE SAME TALKING POINT. THAT. THE SOLUTION IS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING. BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT BUILDING MORE HOUSING IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME. AND IN THE MEANTIME. IN MY COMMUNITY AND MY. EVEN IN MY AFFLUENT PARTS OF MY DISTRICT I'M HEARING. FOR MORE STORIES OF PEOPLE THAT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THEIR RENTS. THAT THAT THAT YOU KNOW EXPERIENCING RAN GALLON XING. AND THEY'RE BEING EVICTED. SO THAT THE LANDLORDS CAN JACK UP THE RENTS. AND SO. YOU KNOW I FEEL THAT TO. THAT WE NEED TO SIDE WITH THE RENTERS ON THIS ONE. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI MISTER MAYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I. RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION AND WHICH I DON'T OFTEN RISE TO OPPOSE ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE A GREAT AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW HOW MUCH WORK THAT HE HAS DONE ON THIS BILL THE ISSUE FOR ME. IS THE ISSUE OF BANKING. AND I FEAR THAT WITH THIS BILL BEFORE US TODAY THAT FOR SOME PARTS OF THE STATE WILL PROVIDE SOME RELIEF. FOR UPWARD PRESSURE WITHIN THE RENTAL MARKET BUT ALSO WILL DISTORT THE MARKET. IN INLAND CALIFORNIA IN IN MY DISTRICT AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THIS A BILL THAT SAYS THAT EVERY YEAR THAT'S CALLED SEVEN AND A HALF A PERCENT PER YEAR LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO RAISE THEIR RIGHT THERE THEIR RENT. EVERY SINGLE YEAR SEVEN AND A HALF 8% WHEN IN SOME PARTS OF MY DISTRICT THEY'RE NOT RAISING THEIR RENT AND THEY CAN'T BANK THAT. SO EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY'RE GONNA RAISE SEVEN A HALF A PERCENT MAYBE IF THEY HAD DONE IT FOR THREE YEARS NOW THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT I WAS. AT AN EVENT THIS WEEKEND AND I HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE TELL ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN FACT THE ONE LANDLORDS SAID. SENT. SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL I THINK HAS SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME PARTS OF THE STATE IT WILL PROVIDE RELIEF BUT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IT WILL ACTUALLY DISTORT THE MARKET AND THEY WILL END UP BEING UPWARD PRESSURE AND ACTUALLY INCREASE THE COST OF HOUSING. SO REGRETFULLY MEL B. OPPOSING TODAY. FAMOUS REYES MEASURE COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I AM OF PLEASED TO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MAJOR. AND I FIND IT INTERESTING BILL A CHANNEL SO MUCH OF MY LIFE IT SEEMS THIS TOPIC. DRAWS TOGETHER A GREAT DEAL FOR ME. I WAS ADMITTED THE PRACTICE OF LAW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. MY FIRST CLIENT WAS IN WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS THE SHELTER INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WORKED IN THAT INDUSTRY. UNTIL THIS HOUSE RECRUITED ME TO COME BACK IN A RUN THE BANKING FINANCE INSURANCE COMMITTEE IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. SO I LOOK AT IT SORT OF THROUGH THE LENS OF MY LAW CAREER WORK IN THE SHELTER INDUSTRY. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE ON THE FINANCE SIDE FOR THIS HOUSE. I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I LOOKED AT WAS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE WAS THE SIGNING OF THE DAVIS STIRLING COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT ACT. WHICH IS IMPLICATED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS CONDOS SO CALLED ARE REMOVED FROM THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL. I DO THINK THAT THERE IS ISSUES IN HERE FOR US ON A GOAL FOR BASED SYSTEMS LAWMAKERS WE ARE GOING TO WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE FATAL TO THE APPROVAL THIS BILL TODAY. I THINK AS A GENERAL MATTER WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO WATCH. IT PEOPLE BRING FORWARD THE ARGUMENT. THAT WE MIGHT IT JUST THE RULES TO PROMOTE AND SUPPORT MAINTENANCE. OF LONG ESTABLISHED FACILITIES WHETHER CONDOS ARE SINGLE FAMILY OR DUPLEXES OR CRY TAXES OR- FOUR PLEXUS. I DON'T DOUBT BE A RIGHTEOUS THING TO LOOK AT THIS DOES HAVE A TEN YEAR SUNSET. I THINK THEY'LL BE OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF SUPPORT. THE PRESERVATION OF OUR HOUSING STOCK GOING FORWARD. BUT I DON'T I SEE THAT AS A VERY SUBORDINATE ISSUE. TO THIS I THINK THE USE OF A- CPI. TO HELP ESCALATE. THE CAP. OR TO ENLARGE THE CAP IS ACTUALLY GOOD I TEND NOT TO LIKE CPI'S. OFTEN VOTE AGAINST A BUT IN THIS CONTEXT I SEE IT ALL TO THE GOOD. AND. SO I LOOK AT IT IS IT IT. THE WAY IT ADDRESSES THE HOUSING MARKET THE WAY IT PROVIDES A. LARGE CEILING ON RATE INCREASES THE FACT THAT THERE IS THAT SUNSET. I THINK THESE ARE PROVISIONS WHICH GIVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS TO LET. FOLKS WHO HAVE PROPERTIES OPERATE WITHIN THIS FRAMEWORK AND. SO THAT IT COMES DOWN TO JUST THE DECISION AS WE AS MEMBERS ON THE FOR TO DECIDE WHERE WE ARE. AND. I CAN'T HELP MYSELF I GOT A QUOTE OF THE FAMOUS OLD TESTAMENT PROPHET ISAIAH. BUT I'LL TELL YOU TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT. THE VERSE I'M GONNA SHARE ACTUALLY INCLUDES THE WORD SHELTER. AS IT HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT SHELTER AND WE'RE DIVERSE IN QUESTION IS TO ME. THE BEST IMAGE. OF LEADERSHIP FOR OTHERS DELIVER FINE. AND I WILL TELL YOU IS KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE IT'S A PICTURE FRANKLY OF A ROCK. ON A LANDSCAPE. AND APPARENTLY INANIMATE OBJECTS. IS THE IMAGE THAT ISAIAH PULLS UP. HE SAYS A KING SHALL RULE WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS OKAY AS A IS TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT WE'RE GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE. IT'S PROSTHETIC WHEN HE USES IT BUT WE GET A FIRM HE'S TALK ABOUT A- PLACE WHERE THERE'S A GOOD GOVERNMENT. AND HE SAYS EACH ONE EACH PERSON. WE'LL BE LIKE A SHELTER FROM THE STORM. SO WE'RE GOVERNOR'S TO HIS WORK THERE IS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE FINDING SHELTER FROM THE STORM A WHAT IS A CHARACTER THE SHELTER HE TALKS ABOUT. LIKE STREAMS OF WATER IN THE DESERT AND THE SHADOW. OF A GREAT ROCK. IN A WEARY LAND A THIRSTY LAND. THIS IMAGES ONE. THAT WHEN PEOPLE AROUND IN THE JUDEAN DESERT AND IT'S THE SUMMER. IT'S A SCORCHING PLACE. SCORCHING PLACE AND HOSPITABLE TO LIFE. AND AS A SAYS. LEADERSHIP IS LIKE A ROCK IN THE DESERT IT OPPOSES ITSELF. BETWEEN THE FORCES OF ESCORTS SOMEBODY. SO I TO CREATE SHELTER THIRTY SECONDS COOLEY AND INCIDENTALLY IT MEANS THE PERSON WHO FUNCTIONS LIKE THAT ROCK MAY TAKE SOME OF THAT HEAT THEMSELVES. TRY TO GET A BILL LIKE THIS IS INDISPUTABLY A BILL RELEASE TO SHELTER. PROVIDING SHELTER PROVIDED SHELTER FROM WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS A SCORCHING HEAT IN OUR DAY. AND A CALLS US ALL TO SAY ARE WE WILLING TO TAKE SOME OF THAT HE TO GIVE OTHERS SHELTER. URGENT ABLE THING WAS COOLEY MEMBERS OF YOUR SEEKING RECOGNITION PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONES NOW. MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. WITHOUT OBJECTION YES WHAT WAS THE POINT OF RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. THE POINT OF RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE IS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTRY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SURVIVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL RIGHT THERE THANK YOU. SO MEMBERS WE'VE INCREASED MINIMUM WAGE BUT YET PEOPLE STILL CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE WE'VE DONE THINGS TO MESS WITH OUR LECTURE CITY OUR WATER IS STATED EARLIER. BUT YET WE KEEP TOYNE WITH. PEOPLE'S BUDGETS. PUTTING A CAP ON THE RAIN. IS IT GOING TO FIX IT. WE KNOW THIS THERE SO MANY ECONOMICAL FACTORS AT STAKE HERE. BUT YET WE OVER REGULATE EVERY OPPORTUNITY. ACTUALLY XIN SAY WE SOME OF YOU DECIDE OVER REGULATE AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. BUT WE'VE DONE THIS WE HAVE 24% OF OUR POPULATION LIVING IN POVERTY IN ANOTHER 25% THAT ARE ONE PAYCHECK AWAY. THAT HAVE TO SIT DOWN EVERY MONTH AND MAKE THOSE HARD DECISIONS. BETWEEN. PAYING THE RENT OR THEIR MORTGAGE. IN THEIR LECTURE BILL THEIR WATER BILL. IN FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. OR. OR GOT SOCCER SEASON COMING UP SO CAN THEIR KIDS EVEN PLAY. CAN THEY BUY THAT NEW SET OF CLEATS BECAUSE THEY'VE OUTGROWN THE ONES FROM LAST YEAR. OUR FAMILIES. EVERY MONTH FOR MAKING THESE CHOICES. IN THE FACT THAT WE SEE HERE AND WE THINK LET'S JUST PUT A CAP ON IT LET'S JUST PUT MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS IS GONNA SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE TRUE PROBLEM WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY SAID IT IT'S THE HOUSING CRISIS. YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO I TOOK THIS AMAZING TRIP. WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE AND WE WERE IN CHINA. IN THE BILL TWO HUNDRED CITIES IS SIZE A CHICAGO IN A MENTALLY YEARS. BECAUSE THE DON'T OVER REGULATE LIKE WE DO. GRANTED THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS WE DO. BUT. WE ARE ABLE TO GET THINGS DONE. WE HAVE OTHER MEASURES THAT WE CAN DO. BUT YET WE'VE CHOSEN NOT TO DO THOSE BECAUSE WE THINK THERE YOU ALL THINK FOR SOME REASON HAVING GOVERNMENT JUST GRAB A HOLD OF EVERYTHING THEY CAN. IS GOING TO BE THE ANSWER. MEMBERS THIS ISN'T THE ANSWER THIS ISN'T THE WAY TO GO LET'S REALLY STOP AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THESE FANS LEAST MY COLLEAGUE FROM YUCCA VALLEY IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

WHEN I WATCH YOU OVER THE OVER MY NOW GOING ON MY FIFTH YEAR IN THIS LEGISLATURE BUT WATCHING OUR GOVERNMENT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. VOTE ON BILL AFTER BILL. THAT RAISES THE COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE. WHEN YOU YOUR PS UP TO A 100% NOW WE'RE GONNA READ A HUNDRED PERCENT. AND ARE GONNA JACK UP EVERYBODY'S UTILITY BILLS 2100% BY THE TIME THIS IS ALL OVER SAID ALREADY BEEN RAISED 80% WE PAY. WE PAY 80% MORE FOR ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE STATE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. ALL THE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS THAT YOU CONTINUE TO PILE ON. ANY SEQUEL REFORM THIS YEAR. FOR HOUSING TO ACTUALLY BUILD MORE HOUSING IN THIS STATE STATEWIDE. NOPE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT. BUT AS YOU CONTINUE TO PILE ON ALL THE REGULATIONS AND MAKE RENTS HIGHER THAT MAKE THE COST OF HOUSING. HIGHER. WHEN THE THINGS THAT YOU PASS THAT MAKE THE COST OF BUYING FOOD HIGHER. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY ON THIS FLOOR TO BLAME THE GIG ECONOMY. FOR POVERTY IN THIS STATE. THE AUDACITY TO BLAME LANDLORDS FOR HOMELESSNESS. I MEAN FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TALKING HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HELP THE HOMELESS AND ABOUT HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE GET OUT OF POVERTY HEY GUYS LAST I CHECKED IS. 18% NOW IN CALIFORNIA. RIGHT AND THE COST KEEP GETTING HIGHER. AND NOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL YOU SAY IS GOING TO HELP THEM. HELP PEOPLE ON THE MARGINS AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT HOMELESS AND YET WE HAVE MORE HOMELESS NOW YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN IN POWER.

AND I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO I KNOW THEY'RE HARD TO THE RIGHT PLACE THEY SEE THE RENTS GOING HIGHER THE FRUSTRATED. A LOT OF RENTAL ADVOCATES. SOME IN THE GALLERY. PLEASE ASK YOURSELF HOW THIS BILL HELPS YOU. OKAY. AND GIVE YOU A LITTLE VIEW OF WHAT GOES ON IN THIS BUILDING THIS BILL SAYS THAT THEY CAN RAISE YOUR RATE YOUR RENT EVERY YEAR BY 7% AND 8% ARE YOUR WAGES INCREASING. BY 8% EVERY YEAR. NO BUT THAT'S THE DEAL THAT GOT CUT THE GENTLEMAN FROM SACRAMENTO SAID IT REALLY CLEARLY WHY ARE THE BIG CORPORATE LANDLORDS. NOT OPPOSING THIS BILL. WHY BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING A HELL OF A DEAL. THEY'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO RAISE RENTS 8% A YEAR. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AND THE MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO USUALLY ARE ACTUALLY ARE THE ONES WHO KEEP RENTS LOW AND PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT DEALT BUT THEY'LL HAVE THAT. CAP AS WELL. BUT THE CORPORATE LAND BIRDS THEY'RE GONNA JUST KEEP RAISING THAT TO THAT CAP. EVERY YEAR AND BY THE WAY IF THEY BUILD NEW HOUSING. NONE OF THIS APPLIES TO THEM SO THEY'LL GO OUT MAKE MORE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND NONE OF THESE RULES WILL APPLY TO THEM. BECAUSE THE REAL DEAL HERE IN SACRAMENTO IS FOLKS BIG GOVERNMENT AND BIG BUSINESS LOVE EACH OTHER. BECAUSE WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER THEY CAN MAKE THE DEAL BUT ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE SMALLER BUSINESSMEN THE MAMA POPS. THE INDUSTRIES THAT DON'T HAVE LOBBYIST. THEY DON'T GET CUT IN ON THE DEAL. AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT HAPPENED. SO WHEN ALL THESE PEOPLE STAND UP HERE AND TELL YOU HOW THEY'RE HELPING YOU. PLEASE JUST ASK THE QUESTION READ THE BILL WHAT IT ACTUALLY DOES AND WHAT IS GOING TO DO IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IT REALLY DOESN'T HELP YOU. BUT WHAT IT WILL DO IS REDUCE SUPPLY HIM I DON'T WANT TO GET A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT. I KNOW I DON'T JUST BELIEVE I KNOW THAT THE FREE MARKET BRINGS ABOUT LOWER COSTS FOR ALL. THIRTY WE DON'T HAVE A FREE MARKET. IN CALIFORNIA NOT AT ALL WE ARE BIG GOVERNMENT AND BIG BUSINESS AND IT'S WORKING OUT GREAT FOR THEM. MISS WICKS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IS A PROUD JOINT AUTHORED TO THIS BILL AND I WANT TO TAKE A SECOND TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT HAS BEEN RAISED AND CORRECT THE RECORD ON SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO MOM AND POPS LANDLORDS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM NICHOLAS HERE I SPOKE TO A LOT OF MOM AND POPS LANDLORDS IN MY DISTRICT AND- A LOT OF THE MOM AND POPS LANDLORDS DISTRICTS THEY DON'T HAVE FOR ONE CASE OR PENSION. THEY HAVE THEIR ENTIRE LIFE SAVING IN A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. IN A CONDO IN A UNIT THAT THEY RENT. THEY WILL BE. EXEMPT FROM THIS BILL. UNLESS THEIR CORPORATE LANDLORDS. RIGHT AND- FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THIS BILL. IF THEY ARE A CORPORATE LANDLORD. THEY STILL HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO RAISE THE RENT UP TO EIGHT PERCENT. MOST LANDLORDS THE AVERAGE JUST 3% INCREASE. SO MOST LENDERS WON'T EVEN RAISE UP TO THE 8% MOST LANDLORDS WANT A GOOD TENANT WHO PAYS THE BILLS ON TIME IS IT GOING TO DESTROY THE PROPERTY. AND IS GOING TO BE AN EASY TEN IT TO WORK WITH BUT THIS GIVES THOSE LANDLORDS THAT FLEXIBILITY SO THIS BILL IS REALLY AIM TO GET OUT THE MOST AGREE JUST CASES THAT WE SEE. IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT WE SAW IN THE FIRES. RIGHT WHERE PEOPLE ARE RAISING RENTS FORTH. LEGISLATION THEN TO GUARD AGAINST THAT PRICE GOUGING. WELL THAT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON LAW FROM THE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SAYS IF THERE IS. A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR NATURAL DISASTER THERE'S NO PRICE GOUGING. WE ARE IN A STATE OF EMERGENCY ON HOUSING RIGHT NOW. IN MY COMMUNITY WE'VE HAD A 47% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IN OAKLAND THE COUNTY ALAMEDA DID RESEARCH ON THAT AND ASK THOSE FOLKS WHY OVER HALF OF THEM. ARE THERE BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC DISPLACEMENT YES THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES YES THEIR DRUG AND ALCOHOL ISSUES BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE THERE BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC DISPLACEMENT I SAT DOWN WITH MY SUPERINTENDENT OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOLS COUPLE WEEKS AGO AND SHE WAS TELLING ME ABOUT. THE HOMELESS TEACHERS THAT TEACH IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THAT IS THE STATE OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. AND DOING NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION WE HAVE CONSTITUENTS THE COME TO THIS BUILDING EVERY DAY THE COME TO OUR OFFICES THAT ARE DEMANDING THAT WE TAKE ACTION. ON THIS ISSUE. AND SO IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO DO THAT. AND FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM LIKE ELVES IN OR WHO IS NOT PRESENT THE MOMENT. I AGREE WITH HER WE NEED MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION. I HAVE A BILL THAT YOU'LL GET TO VOTE ON IN THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS TO DO EXACTLY JUST THAT. AND I HAVE MORE TO YOUR BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO DO EXACTLY JUST THAT'S ALL THESE DO YOU DO THAT SPOKE OUT ON THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ISSUE. ISSUE I EXPECT YOUR AYE VOTE ON THOSE BILLS COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE. IT'S ALSO I'M A CO AUTHOR IN SB FIFTY I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BUILDING MORE HOUSING AT ALL INCOMES. BUT IT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SAY WE EITHER NEED TO BUILD. OR PROTECT TENANTS WE HAVE TO DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TO GET US OUT OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. AND WE CAN SHOULD AND MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. NOW SOME SAY. THIS IS GOING TO EXACERBATE THE HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE IT WILL SLOW DOWN PRODUCTION. THE BUILDERS DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. THEY SAID THIS WON'T DO THAT. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT BILL THE HOUSING IN OUR STATE. I THINK WE ARE MORALLY OBLIGATED TO TAKE ACTION TODAY AND TO PASS THIS BILL THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDER STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE AISLE ON THIS. AND IS IT A PERFECT BILL NO BUT IS IT GOING TO PROVIDE SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS TO FOLKS THAT NEED IT MOST YES. I HAVE BEEN TO MANY HOMELESS SHELTERS IN MY COMMUNITY MANY. MANY ENCAMPMENTS AND TALK TO FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THIS CRISIS FIRSTHAND. TURN A BLIND EYE TO THEM. IS CRIMINAL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS WICKS MR BONTA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THAT DEBATE I APPRECIATE THE SHARING OF THE DIFFERENT. STORIES AND EXPERIENCES AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE CRITICAL IMPORT OF THIS MOMENT THIS THIS IS AN INFLECTION MOMENT THIS IS A TIME WHERE WE EITHER ACT WE DO NOTHING. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT WE MUST ACT AS A BODY FOR THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA I WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE OF REFLECTIONS ON SOME OF THE OUR CONSENT WERE MADE. THERE WAS. BASED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL ON SUPPLY ON BUILDING. AND THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S NOT LOST. ON THE LEAD AUTHOR ON THE JOINT AUTHORS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS. A POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AND IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THE BILL DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BY EXEMPTING. NEW HOUSING FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. SLIPPED BY US THAT WE DIDN'T WE WEREN'T AWARE OF WE WERE AWARE OF IT AND WE ADDRESS THAT. THIS BILL HAS ALSO BEEN CALLED. A RED CAP AND I THINK WORDS MATTER. AND. TO BE CLEAR UNDER THIS BILL RENT HIKES ARE NOT TO EXCEED 10% A YEAR WITH CPI PLUS 5% AS THE FORMULA THAT FORMULA ROWS OF ALLOWS RENTS THAT ARE TWICE AS HIGH AS THE CURRENT AVERAGE INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND PREVENT ONLY THE EXTREME INCREASES THAT LEAD TO DISPLACEMENT SO THIS IS NOT RENT CONTROL THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR TURNING A PROFIT FOR. A REASONABLE RETURN ON INVESTMENT. DOES PROHIBIT SOMETHING WE CAN'T HAVE IN OUR SOCIETY DURING THE STATE OF CRISIS AND THAT IS RENT GOUGING. SO OUT WORDS MATTER THIS IS NOT RECONCILE THIS IS AN ANTI RENT GOUGING BILL. ALSO THE ISSUE OF COSTA HAWKINS IN VACANCY TO CONTROL THIS RACE SO LET'S BE CLEAR IN THIS REGARD. THE BILL LEAVES LEAVES COSTA HAWKINS AND FORCE. WHEN THE UNIT IS VACATED BY TENANT LANDLORD MAY CHOOSE TO RAISE THE RENT TO AN AMOUNT THAT THE MARKET WILL SUPPORT. THEY CAN SEE CONTROL REMAINS INTACT. WE ALSO HEARD DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THIS IS A- EITHER OR FORK IN THE ROAD WHERE EITHER PROTECT TENANTS ARE WE GO WITH SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK THAT FUNDAMENTALLY MISUNDERSTANDS. THE OUR NEED TO ACT THE SCOPE OF OUR NEED TO ACT AND THE CHOICES THAT ARE BEFORE US. THOSE CHOICES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT IS NOT EITHER OR- IT IS BOTH WERE IN A STATE OF CRISIS WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY MORE IN THAT STATE OF CRISIS AND EMERGENCY WE MUST USE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX INTO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER. TO IMPACT THE PROBLEM AND WE MUST TAKE ACTION. AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE THE IMPACT THAT MEETS THE SIZE AND SCOPE AND DEPTH OF THE PROBLEM THE PROBLEM YOU OF ALL DESCRIBE. THE SUFFERING THAT WERE SEEN. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO IT'S A FALSE CHOICE WE CANNOT WE MUST DO BOTH. AND WE MUST TO BOTH THE SESSION. AND WE CAN AND WE WILL DO BOTH THE SESSION THERE ARE SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS PENDING BEFORE US. YOU HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WITH HIS BILL THAT YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR YOUR OTHER BILLS AUTHORED BY OTHER MEMBERS THAT ARE BEFORE US NOW AND INTO THE NEW YEAR SO WE KNOW THAT ARE SET A DESIRE TO AND I NEED TO ADDRESS A PIE SIDE SOLUTION TO MANY OF THOSE WHO STOOD UP TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE TEN PROTECTION BILL HAVE BEEN CHAMPIONS. FOR SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS I WANNA JUST REMIND EVERYBODY MANY OF YOU WERE HERE NOT ALL BUT MANY OF THE MOST. THAT WE ARE ALL HERE TOGETHER IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND WITH AN EFFORT LED BY OUR SPEAKER AND- BY THE OFF THE LEAD AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THE CHAIR OF OUR FAMILY HOUSING COMMITTEE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. TO BRING TOGETHER. SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND MEANINGFUL AND IMPACTFUL SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS. WE HAD A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR RECORDING FREE FEE. THAT ARE PRO TEM AUTHORED WE HAD A MUSTER TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR THAT. WE PUT A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR HOUSING BOND SB THREE BY SENATOR BILL ON THE ON THE BALLOT. ANOTHER TWO THIRDS EFFORT ON THE PART OF THIS HOUSE. THAT I WAS PUT ON THE BALLOT IN PAST WE HAD A CRITICAL STREAMLINING BILL SB THIRTY FIVE BY SENATOR WIENER ALL PASSED. WE PUSH THAT WAS ARE LEFT FOR THE YEAR THAT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. ALL THREE WERE SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS. NONE NONE WERE TENER PROTECTION BILLS. SO TENANTS WAITED. AND THIS IS THE DAY THAT WE HELP OUR TENANTS. THERE ARE SEVENTY MILLION TENANTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO AT THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME. WHEN IT COMES TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A TEN AND THEIR HOME WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT A GARDEN VARIETY RELATIONSHIP INVOLVING SOME TRANSACTION OR EXCHANGE OF WHICH IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S HOME. ABOUT THE PLACE. A PERSON LAYS DOWN THEIR HEAD AT NIGHT WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE FOR THEIR KIDS FEEL SAFER THEIR FAMILY FEEL SAFE. THIRTY SECOND SPOT AND. WE CAN END THEIR SUFFERING AND THEIR PAIN THEIR ANGUISH TODAY BY PASSING THIS BILL WE CAN REALLY PROVIDE HELP THAT THEY NEED WE HAVE FOLKS LIVING IN FEAR THAT THEY ARE ONE RENT GOUGING INCREASE OR ONE DISCRIMINATORY RETALIATORY OR ARBITRARY EVICTION NOTICE AWAY FROM LOSING THEIR HOME. THEY'RE ASKING FOR HELP THERE WERE THE OF OUR HELP THEY'RE DESERVING OF OUR ACTION TODAY I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU BOTH I ON AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. THANK YOU RESPOND TO. THANK YOU MEMBERS. MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO WE ALL KNOW THAT THE COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA IS OUT OF BALANCE WITH THE PAY THAT CALIFORNIANS TAKE HOME WITH THIS BILL WE CAN HELP TO RESTORE THAT SOME BALANCE WE DO IT BY BALANCING THE NEEDS OF FAMILIES WHO NEED TO RENT THE PLACE WITH THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS WE DO IT BY BALANCING THE NEED TO RATED UNSCRUPULOUS LOT LANDLORDS WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT MOST LANDLORDS ARE FAIR. AND SHOULD ALLOW FARE INCREASES WE DO THAT BY BALANCING THE NEED OF RESPONSIBLE RECTOR'S TO FEEL SECURE IN THEIR HOMES WITH JUST BECAUSE PROVISIONS ALLOWING LANDLORDS TO EVICT ABUSIVE TENANTS HOUSING HAS TO BE AFFORDABLE SO THAT FAMILIES CAN BALANCE THEIR BUDGETS THIS BILL HELPS US TO MOVE TOWARD THE ACT. I ASKED PRIVATE ON A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO. YOU MISTER SPEAKER THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE VIBRANT DEBATE. WITH THAT MISTER CHIU YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING ALL OF YOU ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE FOR VERY THOUGHTFUL DEBATE. THEY ALSO WANT TO THANK THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. FOR YOUR COURAGE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT DISCUSSED ABOUT THE POLICIES I THINK EVERYONE HERE IS VERY WELL AWARE OF THE POLICY ARGUMENTS FOR THIS. HOUSE OF EVERYONE KNOWS WHO SUPPORTING THIS AND WHO IS OPPOSING THIS YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE POLITICS. I'D LIKE TO JUST TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE HUMAN IMPACT. OF WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON TODAY. THE PRESS HAS REPORTED THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF US ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE HOMEOWNERS. WE'RE NOT TENANTS. IMAGINE IF YOU'RE A TENANT. IMAGINE THAT AFTER A LONG WEEK LIKE THIS ONE. YOU GO HOME. AND TACKED ON TO YOUR DOOR IS A PIECE OF PAPER. THAT SAYS YOUR RENT IS ABOUT TO BE DOUBLE. OR YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE EVICTED. AND IMAGINE YOU'RE LIKE ALMOST HALF OF CALIFORNIA THAT CAN'T AFFORD AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. EMERGENCY. THINK ABOUT THAT IMPACT ON YOU THINK ABOUT THAT IMPACT ON YOUR HEALTH. ON YOUR PHYSICAL YOUR MENTAL HEALTH THINK ABOUT THAT IMPACT ON YOUR CHILDREN. AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN YOU MIGHT HAVE TO PULL YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT ON YOUR ABILITY. TO GET TO YOUR JOB TO DO YOUR JOB TO KEEP YOUR JOB. THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT. ON YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY ON YOUR COMMUNITY SAFETY. THERE WAS A RECENT UCLA LOST LAW SCHOOL STUDY THAT SHOWED OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS. OVER HALF A MILLION RESIDENTS IN LA COUNTY RECEIVED AN EVICTION NOTICE THINK ABOUT THAT FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND. EVICTION NOTICES IN LA COUNTY ALONE. IT'S NO WONDER CITIES ARE EXPERIENCING DOUBLE DIGIT HOMELESSNESS EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US ON THIS FLOOR. WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF TENANTS IN OUR DISTRICTS WHO HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. WHO ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE THE RENT IS TOO HIGH. LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE HUMAN BEINGS CYNTHIA BELLA FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH WHO IN RECENT YARS SAW 45% RENT INCREASE. STARSHIP HOWL FROM REDWOOD CITY WHO HAS A DISABILITY WHO THIS YEAR RECEIVE A 1100% RENT INCREASE. THOSE OF YOU FROM LA KNOW THE STORY OF THELMA SMITH SHE WAS A HUNDRED AND TWO YEARS OLD SHE WAS EVICTED FROM HER HOME AFTER LIVING THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS. COLLEAGUES WITH A SIMPLE CHOICE TODAY. ON THE ONE HAND WE CAN STAND BY WHILE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HUMAN BEINGS ARE FORCED OUT ONTO OUR STREETS OR WE CAN STAND UP FOR CYNTHIA FOR STASHING. FOR THELMA. THE QUESTION WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IS WHAT KIND OF A SOCIETY DO WE WANT TO LIVE IN. AS A GOOD. ASKS WHAT KIND OF NEIGHBORS ARE WE. I SAY WERE CALIFORNIA I SAY WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT'S WE HAVE A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO STAND AND PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS. ON BEHALF OF EIGHT MILLION TENANTS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.
