GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SUB ONE HEARING ON WEDNESDAY APRIL FOURTH. AND IF I MAY HAVE A CHAIR PER ARGUED IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ISSUE EIGHT FIRST. IT'S A RARITY THAT WE HAVE THE CHAIR OF APPROPRIATIONS HEREIN WOULD LIKE HER TO. BITER OF UP FRONT FIRST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AND THINK PARALLELING THE TO PERCENT EARLY I NEED TO CATCH A FLIGHT. AS YOU KNOW DIAPER NEED IT'S A WELL DOCUMENTED URGENT PROBLEM THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO ADDRESS IF WE WANT TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY FOR SO MANY SINGLE PARENTS AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA WORKING TO ADDRESS DIAPER NEED PROVIDED CRITICAL SAFETY NET FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND EVEN SOME MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. THERE'S MORE THAN TWENTY TO DIAPER BANKS IN CALIFORNIA CERTIFIED BY THE NATIONAL DIAPER BANK NETWORK AND IT DISTRIBUTES NEARLY TEN MILLION DIAPERS A YEAR. AND ALTHOUGH LAST YEAR WE DID BECOME THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO RUN A DIAPER PROGRAM AND HAVE I'M A POLICY WHEREBY CAO WORKS RECIPIENTS CAN GET BAD GET REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DIAPERS. THEY'RE STILL A HUGE UNMET NEED THAT ON MANY OF OUR DIAPER BANKS HELP TO MEET. OUR PROPOSAL REQUESTS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICE TO ESTABLISH A DIAPER BANG GRANT FUND. THESE GRANTS WOULD BE ISSUED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTING AND AND BUILDING CAPACITY FOR EXISTING CERVI DIAPER BANKS AND NONPROFITS. THAT HAVE SOME EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE TO COLLECT AND DISTRIBUTE DIAPERS TO PARENTS IN NEED. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD REVIEW PROPOSALS FROM ELIGIBLE DIAPER BANKS IN NON PROFITS TO ALLOW GRANTS TO PRIMARILY FUND THE COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION DIAPERS STORAGE COSTS IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW DIAPER BANKS. AGAIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD EXTEND DIAPER ACCESS TO POPULATIONS ARE CURRENTLY ARE NOT SERVE THEIR WELFARE TO WORK ADVANCE A GROWING MOVEMENT CALIFORNIA TOWARDS ESTABLISHING COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS URGENT NEED FOR LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. MY OFFICE EXPORTS WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE IN DEPARTMENT ON THIS REQUEST PARTICULAR PARTICULARLY TO CLARIFY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BRAINS THANK YOU FOR THIS CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE. YOU'RE AT SOME POINT SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND NEXT WE HAVE JUST THE BIRTH OF THANK YOU JUSTIN BARTHA WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEMBERS WE CLASS. I'M ALSO ON THE BOARD OF THE NATIONAL DEBT BURBANK NETWORK. WE HAVE RECENTLY HAD CONDUCTED A STUDY OF A DEBORAH BANKS TO SEE WHAT THEIR ECONOMIC IMPACT IS. I'M AND AND THE CITY WAS PROFOUND WE FOUND WAS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE DIAPERS FROM DEBORAH BANKS ARE WORKING. THAT THEY OFTEN REPORT HAVING TO MISS WORK BECAUSE. OF NOT HAVING ENOUGH DIAPERS FOR THE CHILDCARE PROVIDER. WE FOUND THAT WHEN THEY HAVE THE ASSISTANCE OF A DIAPER BANK THE CHILDREN HAVE LESS DIAPER RASHES-AND LESS URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS. AT A RECENT STUDY THAT WE ALSO WORKED ON WITH A YALE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT FOUND THAT. OF THE MOST. SIGNIFICANT. BECAUSE. OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION THAT THE INDICATOR THAT CAN INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT A PARENT WILL EXPERIENCE MATERNAL DEPRESSION A PATERNAL DEPRESSION. IS ACTUALLY LACK OF DIAPER. HELPED LACK OF DIAPERS FOR THEIR INFANT. THIS WAS PROFOUND TO ME ESPECIALLY HAVING SPENT TWENTY YEARS IN THE ANTI HUNGER. COMMUNITY I WOULD HAVE ASSUMED THAT LACK OF FOOD. BUT THAT CAME IN SECOND. SECOND TO NOT HAVING ENOUGH DIAPERS AND WE KNOW WHAT THAT THE IMPACT ON CHILD DEVELOPMENT IS FOR A CHILD ON THAT THAT HAS A PARENT WHO IS DEPRESSED THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ENGAGED AS AN INFANT. LESS LIKELY TO BE HAPPY THEY HAVE STRESS INDICATORS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN OTHER INFANTS. AT THE BEGINNING EXPERIENCING DEPRESSION AT THE AGE OF OF FOUR MONTHS FIVE MONTHS AS AN INFANT. AND THESE. THESE IMPACTS WILL I CARRY FORWARD THROUGHOUT THEIR YEARS OF EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT. AND INTO ADULTHOOD. SO FOR FOR THIS AND SO MANY REASONS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THAT ARE DISCONNECTED TO THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM. AND NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE THE ASSISTANCE ALREADY I PUT IN PLACE TO THE BUDGET A LAST YEAR DO HAVE CONNECTIVITY TO. TO DEBORAH BANKS AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FOR DIAPERS CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS A FEW DIAPER BANKS AND THIS ASSISTANCE WE THINK WILL REALLY HELP DEVELOP A FOOD BANKS AND OTHER AT ASSISTING AGENCIES TO. TO BUILD THE CAPACITY TO DISTRIBUTE DIAPERS TO LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND FOR THIS REASON WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU COME WE HAVE LISTED ON THE PANEL. DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE L. L. IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THIS PROPOSAL. YOU TOOK THE KNIFE. SO THAT'S JUST. A COVER FINANCE HER WORDS I THINK WE JUST NOTE THAT WE WOULD STILL NEED TIME TO LOOK INTO THIS PROPOSAL. NOT WITHSTAND THE POLICY MERIT AND WOULD HAVE TO LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT A STATE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT. GREAT. GOT NEXT WE WILL TAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE IT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ENTER SHANE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS IN SUPPORT WERE VERY PROUD THAT THE SAN DIEGO FOOD BANK. IN THE. MEMBERS DISTRICT HAS A DATA BANK ON BUT NOT ALL DOING WITH CITY SPENT THINK. THANK YOU. KEVIN AS THEM CHORUS A CALIFORNIA WILL FOR ITS ORGANIZATION. STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHT WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS PEOPLE MAY HAVE. I'LL ADD MY OWN TWO CENTS IF I CAN. I'M. PROUD AS A PARENT THAT WE ARE NOW THROUGH THE DIAPER STAGE. THAT WAS NOT TRUE LAST YEAR AND YET I RECOGNIZE HOW MUCH OF A STRESS THIS IS ON YOUNG FAMILY. AND REALLY APPRECIATE THIS I REQUEST FROM. WITH THAT WE WILL. I AM I I HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND I CALLED THE MEXICAN TWINS BECAUSE THEY'RE FOURTEEN MONTHS APART AND SO I WAS DOING THAT DUAL DIAPERS THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME AND IT'S IT REALLY IS STRESSFUL AND. COSCO'S. IT IS GREAT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. AND WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET DIAPERS IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. NOT ONLY FOR BABY SITTING YEAH PURPOSES BITE YOU KNOW JUST TO RUN YOUR OWN LIFE SO THANK YOU FOR THE BILL. YOU ARE THE PROPOSAL. AND THEM HOLD LEAVE IT. I THIS ITEM OPEN BUT HE WANTED TO SAY YOU'VE HELD THE BAR UP HIGH FOR MANY OF US TO. IMPLEMENTED AND INSTITUTE FOOD ARE DIAPER BANKS WITHIN OUR FEEDBACKS AND SO. MANY OF US HAVE OUR JOBS TO DO BOTH HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT ALSO LOCALLY. THANK YOU FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND WE WILL HOLD THAT I DON'T. THINK YOU. QUILTED. SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH THAT FIRST AND MAKE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA HERE HARPER. MATHIS RUBIO. WOULD. QUORUM. GREAT WE WILL NOW MOVE TO ISSUE ONE PLEASE PLEASE BUT WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT. ALL. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I'M WILL LIKE BORN DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. WE ARE SORT OF HERE TO DO THE BROAD CAL WORKS REVIEW AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER. TO KIM JOHNSON WHO RUNS THE CAL WORKS AND CHILDCARE BRANCH FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON I CHAIR MEMBERS AND STAFF CAN JOHNSON CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'D YOUR GENDER DOES A GREAT JOB IN LAYING OUT THE OVERVIEW OF WHERE THE COW WORKS PROGRAM AT IS TODAY AGAIN. CAL WORKS IS CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THE TEMPORARY AID TO NEEDY FAMILIES PROGRAM PROVIDING CASH ASSISTANCE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO THE FAMILIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SEEING. A HISTORIC LOW IN TERMS OF CASELOAD AS SINCE PRE RECESSION LEVELS OF AROUND FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AS SERVING A LITTLE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I WANTED TO KNOW THE COUPLE OF THINGS RELATED TO THE CALL OUT ESSENTIALLY OF POVERTY AT REALLY. ACCESS OF OUR PROGRAM. OUT IN IN MEETING FAMILIES WITH OUR. OUR PROGRAM DESIGNED OF SUPPORTING CHILDREN WHO. ARTS OFF OF. ART ART IF THEIR PARENTS ARE AND OFF AID. AND WE ARE SERVING CLOSER TO FIFTY THREE PERCENT OF AT CHILDREN IN POVERTY ACROSS CALIFORNIA VERSUS THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF AROUND TWENTY PERCENT FOR OTHER STATES THAT WE ARE. DOING THAT AS A GOOD A GOOD WAY BY OUR PROGRAM. IN TERMS OF WORK PARTICIPATION RATES. WE ARE SUCCESSFULLY MEETING THE ALL OVERALL AT CAL WORKS WORK PARTICIPATION RATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE FIFTY PERCENT THRESHOLD. WE ARE HAVE BEEN OVER SIXTY PERCENT OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. AS WELL AS. BAD THEN REDUCING OUR PENALTIES SO LOOKING. AT ORIGINALLY WHAT WE HAD AT ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION EXPOSURE IN TERMS OF PENALTIES FOR NOT MEETING QUIRK DISSIPATION RATE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE TWO PARENT RATE WHICH IS A SMALLER PORTION OF OUR CASELOAD. WE'VE REDUCE THAT DOWN TO FORTY POINT TWO MILLION I'M IN TERMS OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. I'M RELATED TO THE AT WORK PARTICIPATION RATE. ALSO JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE WORK PARTICIPATION RATE IS ONE MEASURE I'M WITHIN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM AND YOUR GENDER LAYS OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CAL WORKS AT OUTCOMES IN ACCOUNTABILITY REVIEW. AND INITIATIVE THAT HAS. THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING AND THIS IS REALLY. BEEN A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AT THAT INCLUDES MANY AT DIFFERENT AS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROCESS INCLUDING CURRENT FORMER AT CALYX. PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AND WHAT THIS WHAT WE ARE ESTABLISHING OUR NEW WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN DEMONSTRATE THE SUCCESS OF THE COW WORKS PROGRAM AT BOTH IN PROCESS AND OUTCOME MEASURES BUT LOOKING AT. NOT ONLY EMPLOYMENT RATES IN IN THE THRESHOLD OF EMPLOYMENT HOURS THE COW WORKS PROGRAM REQUIRES BUT ALSO LOOKING AT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT PROGRAM ENTRY AND EXITS AND ALSO HAS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOOKING AT CHILD AND FAMILY WELL BEING OUTCOMES SO. WE ARE HOPING THAT TOWARDS THE END. OF THIS YEAR THAT THE LATE FALL WE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD SOLID SENSE OF WHAT THOSE MEASURES WILL LOOK LIKE. I IN AND ALLOW AT COUNTY SOMETIMES A PLANNED AND AUTOMATE SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE SOME OF THOSE MEASURES AB IN A ENACT CLEAR WAY. SO THAT WE ARE FULLY LOOKING AT IMPLEMENTING THE NEW CAL OR PROCESS BY JULY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AGAIN IT IT WILL BE A THREE YEAR CYCLE. SO COUNTIES WILL SENSUALLY BE LOOKING AT DOING A SELF ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY HOW THEY ARE DOING ON THOSE MEASURES THAT WE IDENTIFIED AGREE UPON. I THEY WOULD USE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS LOCALLY TO LOOK AT THE CONTEXT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY OF THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SO FORTH. AND THE CREATES BASICALLY. AB PLAN I'M ON A PRE IMPROVEMENT ON WHERE THEY'D LIKE SAID TO LOOK AT SOME MEASURES OF SUCCESS SO. AND THAT BEGINS A THREE YEAR CYCLE IN THAT'S AT MODELED AFTER OFF OF THE CHILD WELFARE EXAMPLE IN AB SIX THREE SIX OUT SOMETIME AGO. AGAIN I WAS UP THERE SOME CPAS OTHER SPECIFIC OUR. PORTS IT PUSH PORTIONS OF THE GENDER THAT I'M HAPPY TO COVER IN MORE DEPTH BUT WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE FOR QUESTIONS OR OR ANYTHING OF SCRIPT FOCUSED. THANK YOU FOR THE OVERVIEW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO ANY COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON PLEASE EXCUSE ME TED ALMOST LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AND IT ISN'T THE MATERIAL IN THE IN THE AGENDA WHICH IS RATHER THOROUGH ON THE ONLY THING OUR OFFICE WOULD NOT AT THIS POINT IS THAT. SEVERAL MONTHS OF CASELOAD HAVE COMMANDS INTO MINISTRATION LAST PUT TOGETHER A FORECAST THAT IT'S BUDGET PUT OF PROPOSALS BUILT ON. OUR OFFICE LOOKED AT THOSE SIX MONTHS OF NEW DATA AND DIDN'T FIND ANY REASON TO THINK THAT THE DATATREND WOULD. INDICATE THAT THE MAY REVISION CASELOAD ESTIMATES WOULD DIFFER SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE JANUARY PROPOSAL STORE FOLLOWING THOSE MONTH TO MONTH BUT THINGS LOOK ON TRACK. GREAT THANK YOU. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE AT THIS TIME. SEEN NONO BRING IT TO THE DIVESTMENT QUESTIONS WE MAY HAVE. WITH THAT WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. THIS. WE'RE GONNA START WITH CHRISTIAN SCHUMACHER IF WE CAN AND THEN FRANK MECCA. HELLO MY NAME IS KRISTEN SCHUMACHER AND I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAKER TODAY. AMIR MERCK THE PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CALVERT'S GRANTS ANOTHER MYSTERY HOW COVER SCREENS HAVE LOST VALUE OVER TIME. WELL ALSO COMPARE KELBERG'S GRANT LEVELS TO A COUPLE DIFFERENT PARTY THRESHOLDS AS WELL AS THE BASIC FAMILY BUDGET IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. THE HELLO I PROVIDED. INCLUDES A NUMBER OF CHARTS A DEMONSTRATE MY KEY POINTS TODAY IF YOU LIKE TO FOLLOW ALONG AND I LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IN CASE THEY OTHERWISE NO. WHEN I SPEAK OF CAL WORKS GRANT LEVELS I'M REFERRING TO THE MAXIMUM MONTHLY GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF THREE AND A HIGH COST COUNTY. THE FIRST HURT ON PAGE TWO SHOWS OF THE CUPBOARDS GRANTS HAVE LOST MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF ITS VALUE SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CAL WORKS IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. DURING THIS PERIOD STATE POLICYMAKERS FRICKLEY SUSPENDED AND THAT ULTIMATELY ELIMINATED THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OR THE COLA. THIS ENSURED THE COOLER ENSURES THAT THE VALUE THE GRANTS KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION. IN ADDITION POLICYMAKERS ALSO REDUCE THE GRANT LEVELS DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WHICH ALSO ERODED THE VALUE OF COVER EXPERIENCE TODAY. THE POLICY MAKERS HAD INCREASE GRANT LEVELS ANNUALLY TO ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION THE MAXIM CAO GROUP WITH CAL WORKS GRANT. BE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX DOLLARS PER MONTH IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN STATE FISCAL YEAR. THIS IS FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSED PROPOSED VALUE OF JUST SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS. FEELING THE MUSCLE INCREASE GRANTS FOR INFLATION EACH YEAR. SEVERELY PRODUCES THE RESOURCES THAT PARENTS COULD USE TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THE FAMILY OR PAY THEIR RENT. IT'S LIKE A VEST AND CAL WORKS GRANTS IS EXPRESSLY TROUBLING WHEN COMPARED TO THE COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. THE CHART ON PAGE THREE SHOWS THAT THE MEDIAN RENT AND HIGH COST COUNTIES HAS FAR OUTPACED CAO WORKS GRANTS IN RECENT YEARS. CURRENTLY THE CAL WORKS GRANT FALLS NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS SHORT OF THE COST OF COVERING A TWO BEDROOM RENTAL AND HIGH COST COUNTY. EVEN A LOW COST COUNTY SUCH AS FRESNO FOR SACRAMENTO MEDIAN RENTS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN THE CAL WORKS GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF THREE. THE CALYX GRANDPA'S THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS SHORT OF THE MEDIAN RENT FOR TWO BEDROOM HOME IN THOSE COUNTIES. BECAUSE COVERS GRANTS HAVE LOST VALUE MAXIMUM CAO WORKS GRANT IN HIGH COST COUNTY FILL SO THE FAMILIES OUT OF THE POVERTY. THE POVERTY IS DEFINED AS FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. AND THAT MEANS FOR A FAMILY OF THREE. MAKING ENDS MEET ON LESS THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN FACT THE CHART ON PAGE FOUR SHOWS THE ABSENT A GREAT INCREASE IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE CAL WORKS GRANT WILL REMAIN BELOW THE POVERTY LINE FOR THE ELEVENTH STRAIGHT YEAR. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE ANALYZE MAXIMUM TOWER CAO WORKS GREAT WILL BE JUST FORTY ONE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL PARTY LINE. AS DEMONSTRATED BY THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING THIS PAST MONDAY ON ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES WE KNOW THAT LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY HAS PROFOUND EFFECT ON CHILDREN AFFECTING THE WELL BEING WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. BUT EXPERTS CHART SHOW HOW THE MAXIMUM COVERAGE GRANT STACKS UP AGAINST POVERTY THRESHOLDS IN THE BUDGET CENTERS MAKING ENDS MEET BASIC FAMILY BUDGETS. THE TURN PAGE BY PROVIDES DATA FOR THE SANTA ROSA METRO REGION AND SEE IT AND CINEMA COUNTY. THE BLUE BAR ON THE LEFT IS THE MONTHLY OFFICIAL FEDERAL PARTY THRESHOLD FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN WHICH IS ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH ACROSS THE ENTIRE U. S. THIS. VALUE DOES NOT VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY AND THAT BAR WILL REMAIN THE SAME ACROSS ALL THREE OF YOUR CHARTS. AS YOU CAN SEE BY THE REDLINE MACAU WORKS CURRENT IS ABOUT HALF OF THIS PARTY THRESHOLD. THE GREEN BAR IN THE MIDDLE AFFECTS THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY SPECIAL FOR THE SANTA ROSA REGION. THAT'S CAN PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF POVERTY FOR MANY REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS THAT IT DOES VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY AND SANTA ROSA. THE MAXIMUM GREAT IS ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL PARTY THRESHOLD OF ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND FINALLY THE ORANGE BROWN THE RIGHT SHOWS THE BASIC FAMILY BUDGET FOR ONE PARENT FAMILY WITH TWO CHILDREN. THIS VALUES FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET POLICY CENTERS MAKING ENDS MEET REPORT WHICH WE RELEASED THIS PAST DECEMBER THAT SHOWS HOW MUCH INCOME FAMILIES NEED TO AFFORD THE BAICS SUCH AS HOW DO YOU HOUSING FOOD HEALTH CARE JUST NAME A FEW. FOR EXAMPLE WE ESTIMATE THAT A SINGLE PARENT WITH TWO KIDS NEED ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. PER MONTH AND CINEMA COUNTY JUST A FOR THE BASICS. IT'S NOT A COUNTY THE CAL WORKS GRANT IS THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE MAKING ENDS MEET BUDGET FOR THAT COUNTY. THE TERM PAGE SIX PROVIDE SIMILAR DATA FOR THE LOS ANGELES MATURE REGION THE STORY HERE IS VERY SIMILAR TO SANTA ROSA AND SONOMA COUNTY. AS ILLUSTRATED BY THE BRIGHT RED LINE THE MAXIMUM CALPERS GRANT FALLS FAR SHORT OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY THRESHOLD AND THE MAKING AND SPEAK FAMILY BUDGET. JUST THIRTY ONE AND THIRTEEN PERCENT RESPECTIVELY OF THOSE TWO VALUES. FINALLY THE CHART ON PAGE SEVEN SHOWS DATA FOR THE FRESNO METROPOLITAN AND FRESNO COUNTY. FRESNO IS CONSIDERED A LOW COST COUNTY IN THE COMICS PROGRAM SO THE CELTICS GRANT LEVEL IS LOWER TO REFLECT THIS GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION. HERE THE MAXIMUM GRANT FOR FAMILY THREE IS FORTY TWO PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY THRESHOLD THIRTY NINE PERCENT OF THE S. P. M. AND SIXTY PERCENT OF THE MAKING ENDS MEET FAMILY BUDGETS. IN CONCLUSION THERE IS ABUNDANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT CAL WORKS GRANTS FALL FAR SHORT OF SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. FEELINGS OF LOSS RESOURCES DUE TO THE SUSPENSION AND THE EVENTUAL ELIMINATION OF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THIS THEM OUT THAT MAXIMUM COVERAGE GRANT FILLS OF THE FAMILIES OUT OF THE POVERTY. WE KNOW THAT POVERTY IMPOSES A VERY STEEP COST ON CHILDREN OR FAMILIES AND ON THE STATE'S AND CAL WORKS PROGRAM IS OVERDUE FOR A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT. THE FINAL SLIDE IS OUR PROJECT INFORMATION THE BUT IT CENTER I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL BUT ALSO AFTER THE HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS SCHUMACHER NEXT WEEK FREDRIKA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FRANK MECCA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND TODAY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF A LARGE COALITION. OF INTERESTED GROUPS IN THE STATE WHO ARE HERE TO URGE NAM A COWARD'S GRANT INCREASED AND DEEP POVERTY. FOR CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN THAT PROGRAM AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE GRANT LEVELS KEEP UP WITH INFLATION SO WE DON'T. CONTINUE TO HAVE THE EROSION AND SCHUMACHER TALKED ABOUT. YESTERDAY HAD THE PLEASURE TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR IN THE SUB TO US. HEARING ON ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND WE LEARNED. FROM EXPERTS IN THE STATE WHO ARE DEALING WITH CHILDREN ABOUT. THE REALLY DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ON CHILDREN WE ALSO LEARNED THAT LIVING IN POVERTY PARTICULARLY DEEP POVERTY IS AMONG THE MOST PERNICIOUS. OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND. KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW BASED ON THAT HEARING ABOUT THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN TELLING US FOR AWHILE. IN KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST CHILD POVERTY RATE IN THE NATION. AND KNOWING THAT WE HAVE. A DANGEROUSLY HIGH NUMBER OF VERY POOR CHILDREN WHO ARE LIVING IN A STATE OF NEAR DESTITUTION AND THAT WE SHOULD CALL IT WHAT IT IS. I'M AND KNOWING THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. AND NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS JUST SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND THE CURRENT CONDITION. THAT CHILDREN THIS PROGRAM LIVE IN IS A STAIN ON OUR STATE. THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR OF TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY AS A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON CHILDREN. IT'S TOXIC STRESS THE DAMAGES THEY'RE DEVELOPING BRAINS CHILDREN LIVING IN POVERTY HAD NOW AVERAGE OF SEVEN TO TEN PERCENT LESS GRAY MATTER. IN THE FRONTAL LOBE TEMPORAL LOBE IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS THE AREAS OF THE BRAIN TIED TO LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL FUNCTIONING. THEN CHILDREN WHO WHO ARE NOT POOR. GROWING UP POOR IS A LIFETIME OF NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IT DECREASES THE LIKELY HAD DICK CHILDREN GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. IT LESSENS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE. GAINFULLY I'M EMPLOYED AND A PRODUCTIVE EARNING ADULTS. ON THEY SUFFER FROM NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES NEGATIVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. DEEP POVERTY AND POVERTY FUELS THE INTERGENERATIONAL CYCLE OF POVERTY. POOR CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME POOR DOLLS. NEARLY HALF OF ADULTS WHO ARE PERSISTENTLY POOR DURING THEIR CHILDHOOD. LIVED IN POVERTY A THEMSELVES AT THE AGE OF FIVE COMPARE TO LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF ADULTS WHO NEVER EXPERIENCED POVERTY AS CHILDREN. IF WE WANT TO STOP THE CYCLE OF POVERTY WE NEED TO STOP HAVING KIDS GROWING UP. SO DEEPLY IN IT. I'M PARTY ALSO AFFECTS THE PARENTS ABILITY TO MOVE FROM WELFARE TO WORK. WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED DATA DAY IS YOUR BASIC SURVIVAL HOW I FEED MY CHILD WHERE WILL WE LIVE TONIGHT. IT'S DIFFICULT AN UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT A PERSON LIVING IN THAT A SEVERE ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCE. CAN FOCUS ON THE EDUCATIONAL AND JOB READINESS TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THAT THE CAL WORKS PROGRAMS. OFFERS SO WERE ALSO UNDERMINING WANTED TO KEEP. UP. GOALS OF THE PROGRAM THAT IS HELPING PEOPLE MOVE FROM WELFARE TO WORK. ON IF WEEK. CONTINUALLY REQUIRED THAT THEY LIVE IN A DEEP STATE OF POVERTY THE GOOD NEWS AS WE KNOW HOW TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE. INCREASING THE RESOURCES OF VERY POOR FAMILIES WORKS THE RESEARCH TELLS US. THAT IF LOOK AT VERY LOW INCOME FAMILIES IMPROVE THEIR FINANCIAL WELL BEING IT VASTLY IMPROVES THE WELL BEING OF THEIR CHILDREN. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT EVEN MODEST INCREASES IN DISPOSABLE INCOME MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN IMPROVING WHILE BEING. MONEY MIGHT NOT BE AND IS NOT THE MOST CRITICAL INGREDIENT IN CHILD REARING. BUT THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE BASIC SUCH AS FOOD SHELTER HEALTH CARE EDUCATION MAKES A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CHILDREN'S ABILITY TO THRIVE AS ADULTS. INCREASE HOUSEHOLD INCOME CAN DECREASE MARITAL STRESS LOWER REPORTED DRUG AND ALCOHOL USAGE INCREASE PARENTAL SUPERVISION AND INVOLVEMENT AND STIMULATES HEALTHY BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR CHILDREN. THERE'S THERE'S I'M A A NUMBER OF EMERGING STUDIES. WHERE THEY TESTED PROVIDING RELATIVELY MODEST AMOUNTS OF INCREASED INCOME TO VERY POOR FAMILIES ONE STUDY OF VERY POOR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT RECEIVED MONEY FROM INDIAN GET MONEY FROM INDIAN GAMING? I'M WHAT THEY FOUND THAT EVEN IN VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT WENT UP THERE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS WENT DOWN FAMILY FUNCTIONING IMPROVED. WE KNOW HOW TO REVERSE AND PREVENT THE EFFECTS OF THE TOXIC STRATHEARN CHILDREN'S BRAINS. LET ME LET ME BECAUSE IF I COULD BY IMAGINING A SCENARIO WHERE WE KNEW OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR PATHOGEN THAT WAS IN THE AIR IN THE WATER. AND WE KNEW THE DAMAGE IT DID TO THE BRAINS OF DEVELOPING CHILD. WE ALSO KNOW HOW TO A RACKET. ARM WE WOULDN'T HESITATE. WE WOULD WE WOULD NOT HESITATE BECAUSE WE VALUE CHILDREN AND WE WANT HEALTHY CHILDREN TO THRIVE BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR THEM IT'S MORALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR SOCIETY WE KNOW ALL THOSE THINGS. WE KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM AND WE KNOW HOW TO. TO FIX IT AND TO NOT DO SO WE AYE I THINK IS UNACCEPTABLE WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT. THINK ABOUT. MORE CASH ASSISTANCE FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES I'M IN SPITE OF WHAT WE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS THIS ISN'T SOMETHING WE LEARNED JUST YESTERDAY. I THINK REALLY GETS TO OUR MANY OF THE ISMS THAT UNDERLIE A LOT OF THAT. WELFARE STEREOTYPES THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED THE NATIONAL DEBATE OVER THE PROGRAM. BUT KNOWING WHAT WE NOW NOT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IS AND. AS I SAID BEFORE A FEW TIMES IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND THAT'S WHY WE WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO WORK TOGETHER WITH ADVOCATES. TO MAKE SURE THAT AFTER THIS BUDGET PASSES KNOW CHILD IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM LIVES IN VERY DEEP POVERTY. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE HAVE RUSHED ALONG THOSE. HELLO MY NAME IS FOR TELLING MENDOZA. AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF ANTIOCH. I'M A SINGLE DIVORCED MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN AGES TEN AND TO. TODAY I AM JOINED WITH OTHER PARENTS VOICES MEMBERS ACROSS OUR STATE TO FIGHT BACK DEEP. GENERATION PROPERTY. THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY ARM. TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE GROWING UP. AND LIVING IN PROPERTY. DOING GREAT. I WAS BORN INTO A FAMILY. OF GAME ENVIRONMENTS. AND CRYING. MY MOTHER'S AND FATHER'S STRUGGLED WITH THEIR OWN DEMONS. OF VIOLENCE THINK YOU. AND CRIME AND ABUSE AND DEEP PROPERTY. AS A YOUNG GIRL. I WAS LEFT BEHIND ALONE. NOT KNOWING IF MY OLDER BROTHER OR MOTHER. WOULD RETURN TO GIMME. WE MOVED OFTEN. AND BECAUSE OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE LIVING SITUATIONS AND THE CRIME AND VIOLENCE THAT. WE BROUGHT TO THEM AS WELL. A. I DID GO TO SCHOOL. BUT DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MY PARENTS. BEING INVOLVED. IN MY EDUCATION. I WOULD HIDE FOOD IN MY CLOSET. BECAUSE I KNEW. THAT I WOULDN'T GET MEALS. AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHEN MY STOMACH WAS HURTING. I WOULD HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT. AND I REMEMBER THAT IT WAS. ABOUT THE KICKS THAT WEEK WOULD PROVIDE FOR. I'M. I WAS THERE. IN THIS CHILDHOOD. TRAUMA AND NO ONE'S SEEN ME. EVEN AS YOUNG AS FIVE OR SIX YEARS OLD FOR. I WOULD SIT IN CLASS. AND I REMEMBER MY. HUNGER WAS SO PAINFUL. AND I WOULD ALWAYS HAVE A PAINFUL GROW IN MY STOMACH. I COULDN'T WAIT FOR LUNCH. BECAUSE I KNEW THAT. WAS THE ONLY GOOD MAIL THAT I WOULD RECEIVE. GROWING UP. ALL I CRAVED THAT WAS TO BE NORMAL FOR. INSUFFICIENT WITH OTHER KIDS. AS A MOTHER OF TWO KIDS. I TURNED TO CAL OR. PROGRAM. I CAO WORKS PROGRAMS GIVES ME. WHEN I NEEDED HELP I RECEIVED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED A MONTH. WE CURRENTLY LIVED WITH MY MOTHER. BECAUSE HOUSING IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IS A VERY EXPENSIVE FOR. FOR ONE BEDROOM APARTMENT IT IS. FIFTEEN HUNDRED. THE CASH AID I RECEIVED. WENT TO UTILITIES FOOD AND GAS. THERE IS NO WAY I COULD AFFORD LIVING ON MY OWN. IT WAS CASH GRANT. WAS. REYES. IF THE CASH GRANT WAS RAISED. WHAT I WOULD DO ON HONESTLY? IS TO PROVIDE. MY ELDEST SON. WHICH SHOES. HE WOULD GO AROUND. WHICH SHOES THAT DIDN'T FIT HIM FOR. THAT HAD HOLES ON THE BOTTOM. AND HIS SOCKS WOULD GET WET. IN THE WINTER. BOYS GROW. SO FAST. ALMOST EVERY MONTH IT SEEMS. ARUM. OFTEN. HE OFTEN GOT TEASED. BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE YOU KNOW. THE IN SHOES ARE YOU KNOW PANTS THAT FIT HIM WELL. I AM. IN IT BROUGHT ME BACK TO WHEN I WAS A KID. I WAS. ALWAYS TEASED. I KNOW THE SHAME OF WEARING CLOTHES THAT DIDN'T FIT. OF OTHER KIDS TEASING ME. MY SON WAS CITIES TO. THEIR SELF ESTEEM. YOU HAVE WHEN YOU. CAN WALK INTO A STORE. LIKE WALMART OR TARGET. TO BUY SHOES ISRAEL. I AM GRATEFUL. FOUR THE GOODWILL AND GARAGE SALES. IT WAS WHAT I COULD AFFORD. BUT THE SHAME AND HUMILIATION THAT YOU FEEL AS A CHILD STAYS WITH YOU. I WOULD ALSO BY. HEALTHIER FOOD. SEEMS LIKE. FOOD THAT ISN'T. SO HEALTHY IS LESS EXPENSIVE. ARM. GREAT NOW I SOMETIMES WILL CALL THE FOOD BANKS SALVATION ARMY. AND OTHER CHURCHES. I SHOULDN'T. SOUND IT SHOULDN'T SOUND LIKE. LUXURY TO MEET THE BASIC NEEDS LIKE CLOTHES THAT FIT AND HEALTHY FOOD. BUT IF YOU. ARE IN POVERTY. IT'S LIKE WE DON'T DESERVE IT. I START. I STARTED GOING TO CHURCH. AND FOUND A COMMUNITY. TO SUPPORT ME AND MY CHILDREN. I'M PARTICIPATING IN THE COW ORG WORK GROUP. WHERE I CAN SHARE MY EXPERIENCE TO HELP MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER FOR OTHER FAMILIES? I'M BEGINNING TO HEAL FROM MY PAST. TRAUMA. FROM THE MENTAL EMOTIONAL. AND PHYSICAL ABUSE THAT I HAD GOT FROM MY EX HUSBAND. SO THAT. I CAN BE THE BEST VERSION. FOR MY CHILDREN. I'M. THAT'S WHAT I REALLY WANT. BUT WE NEED. WE NEED. THE LEGISLATOR. AND THE GOVERNOR TO SEE S.. WE WANT. TO BETTER OUR LIVES. WE DON'T WANT OUR KIDS TO EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE EXPERIENCED? SO WE ASK THAT YOU START. BY ENSURING. NO FAMILIES YOU KNOW CHILDREN IS LIVING AND DEEP PROPERTY. THIS IS WHY I WOULD LIKE. THE LEGISLATOR. TO INCLUDE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET. TO BRING GREAT LEVELS UP TO MATCH. THE CURRENT FEDERAL PROPERTY LINE AND. TO. PORT A. POORER OR IT TIES. RELIEF TO FAMILIES. LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY LIVING IN THE PROPERTY. IS HORRIBLE AND MAKES IT HARD TO BATTLE. CLAIM. UP THAT LADDER OF SUCCESS. I DON'T WANT MY CHILDREN OR ANY CHILDREN. IN CALIFORNIA. TO CONTINUE LIVING THIS NIGHTMARE OF T.. PROPERTY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SHELAGH. AS A. PARENT MYSELF I THINK INTO. EVERYONE OPPOSITE WITH KIDS ONCE. THE HAVE PARENTS WERE FIGHTING FOR THEM AND SO ON QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR ADVOCACY HERE TODAY. I THINK. AND. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A. TIGER WOODS BERMAN FINANCE A THINK WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU'RE IT JENDA PROVIDES COST ESTIMATE TO PROVIDE HAVE COLA FOR MAPPING CREASES AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES FOR HALF YOUR COSTS TIED WITH THE CNI OF FOUR POINT FOUR. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WOULD BE SEVENTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION. AND BUDGET YOUR WHICH IS ABOUT SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION HIGHER AT THE END WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA. YOU CAN ROUGHLY DOUBLE THE HOT FOR AN APPROXIMATION OF FOR YOUR COSTS. AND WE'RE ALSO JUST POINT OUT THAT. THERE DOES CONTINUE TO BE A STATUTORY MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING BECAUSE TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT REVENUES. ARE AVAILABLE AFTER PAYING FOR AND ACHIEVE REPEALS. AND PRIOR GRANT INCREASES. THANK YOU. I INADVERTENTLY LEFT OUT THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS DISCUSSION AND WANTED TO SEE IF. HE WANTED TO ADD SOME TESTING. THANK YOU DOCTOR ON THE LOOK ALMOST. LIKE YOU'LL NEVER HEAR ME ARGUE. AGAINST AND MORE GENEROUS ASSISTANCE PAYMENT SYSTEM ON EVERYTHING THAT MR MECHANISM MENDOZA. SPEAKS PUBLIC FOR ITSELF. OWN THE THE ONLY POINT I THINK I'D MAKE HOME IN SETTING THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM IN CONTEXT. IS THAT IT IS INTENDED TO BE INTERACTIVE WITH. A SET OF OTHER BENEFITS IN THE SYSTEMS POTENTIAL. SO IT'S INTENDED TO BE INTERACTIVE WITH. THE SNAP KILL FRESH PROGRAM THE THE NUTRITION PROGRAM IT'S INTENDED TO BE INTERACTIVE WITH POTENTIAL EARNINGS. ON CALIFORNIA HOUSING EARNINGS IN EARNED INCOME DISREGARD SO THAT THEY THERE'S SORT OF NOT UP MARGINAL THE THE THE MARGINAL TAX RATE IN A SENSE ON EARNINGS IS RELATIVELY LOW. OF THE STATE AS YOU KNOW BEGAN STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. ON TWO YEARS AGO MODIFIED THIS PAST YEAR. ON THE FEDERAL EITC IS AS PART OF THAT CONSTRUCT AND OF COURSE THE. LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE TWO YEARS AGO ON APPROVED. A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES ON ALL OF THAT IS INTENDED. TEND TO SORT OF BE AN INTERACTIVE PARA. WE FULLY RECOGNIZE NOT EVERYONE CAN ACCESS ALL PARTS OF IT. AND WHO'S SO. THEY THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY I THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT GOAL. IF I COULD OFFER ONE SORT OF ADVICE. FULL SUPPORT FOR PARK IF I WAS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO PUT THE NEXT POST GOING UP TO THE FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL FOR THE GRANTS. IS ACTUALLY AN ANNUAL COST SOMEWHERE AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION. SO WELL. I WOULD SUGGEST CONCEIVABLY LOOKING AT. OFFERING SORT OF SYSTEMS OF RENT SUBSIDIES. TIED TO YOU KNOW RENT CONTROLS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE MY GREAT FEAR IS. IF AS WE INCREASE GRANT LEVELS IT'S JUST COMING OUT THE OTHER ADS THE RAPACIOUS MOST OF THE HOUSING MARKET IS LIMITLESS. AND THAT REALLY IS WHAT HAS DRIVEN THE CALIFORNIA POVERTY MEASURE IN THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE SO DANGEROUS. BOMB. DOT SAID THAT IS IN THEM. EFFORT TO REIN ON. ANYTHING YOU HEARD FROM HIM. PROPONENTS TODAY IT'S JUST A QUESTION THAT WE'RE IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE WHAT GOES IN ONE WEEK ALMOST LOOKS GREAT ON THE OTHER. THANK YOU. THANK. BELIAU DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS. SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO. HELLO UP PARENT VOICES AND OUR FIFTEEN CHAPTERS ACROSS THE STATE STAND WITH RICH ALLAH. IN. PLEADING. FOR GRANT INCREASES FOR FAMILIES.

WE URGE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL THING. SING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO ME TO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I'M I AM A FORMER TEACHER AND. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'M STILL THE TEACHER OF MY COULDN'T TEACHER AND. I TAUGHT IN FONTANA UNIFIED WHICH IS A VERY LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND. SO TO ADD TO THAT AS TEACHERS THE BURDEN IS ALSO ON AS TO TRYING TO GO. TO HELP CHILDREN WHEN THEY HAVEN'T HAD ANY FOOD. THEY HAVE TWO MATIC EXPERIENCES AT HOME AND THEY WERE STILL EXPECTING THEM TO EXCEL IN THE TEST IN MY MATH TEST. AND. BEING UPSET THAT THEY CAN BRING YOU KNOW BACK A PEEPER WHEN LEADING HAVE A PEN AT HOME IN ORDER TO SIGN THAT. AUTHORIZATION FOR WHATEVER IT WAS AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. AS A TEACHER FOR SIXTEEN YEARS I SAW A LOT OF THOSE KIDS AND. WANTED TO TAKE EVERYBODY HOME WHEN THEY'RE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WAS IMPOSSIBLE I WOULD HAVE HAD SIX HUNDRED CHILDREN BY NOW. AND. IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT OF. NOT JUST AS A TEACHER BUT AS A HUMAN BEING TO SEE KIDS STRUGGLING AND I CAN RELATE TO THE STORY ABOUT THE ISSUES WITH HOLES IN THEM. I WAS NOT BORN IN. THE UNITED STATES AND WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A WE WERE VERY POOR AS WELL AND. BEING NOT FITTING IN AND. QUITE FRANKLY TRYING TO HAVE WITH THE OTHER KIDS HAD WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE AND IT WAS EMBARRASSING AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE HERE. ADVOCATING FOR THIS BECAUSE YOU ARE DOING SOMETHING FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND NOT JUST YOUR CHILDREN FOR THE SIX HUNDRED KIDS THAT I WOULD HAVE HAD. AND THAT THE MANY IN CALIFORNIA SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND I THINK IT'S TIME. YOU KNOW AND I KNOW WE SAY IT'S TIME EVERY TIME BUT IT'S TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO KEEP. KIDS IN THE FOREFRONT WE TALK ABOUT MOVING CALIFORNIA FORWARD AND HOW KIDS IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE. CHILDREN THAT HAVE A HOME TO GO TO FOOD TO EAT THEN YOU KNOW ALL OF OUR TALK IS JUST TALK. BECAUSE THE KICKED WE CAN'T MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD IF WE CAN EDUCATE KIDS WE CAN EDUCATE KIDS IF THEY HAVEN'T HAD FOOD THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE. SO THANK YOU AGAIN AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I KNOW WE'RE ALL HERE. IN FOR THE SAME REASON I'M THE CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES IN THE STORIES THAT I HEAR. AND IN MY COMMITTEE AS WELL ARE ARE QUITE FRANKLY DISTURBING BECAUSE WE ARE THE SIX LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND YET WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. MOVING CHILDREN OUT OF POVERTY. IN AND I LOOK THROUGH THE REPORT AND THIS IS THE ELEVENTH STRAIGHT YEAR WE HAVE NOT A. WE WILL HAVE BEEN BELOW THE POVERTY BUT THE POVERTY LINE WE HAVEN'T. INCREASED. THE GROUNDS OF THE I'M FROM LA COUNTY AND IN LA COUNTY. THE. LIVING THOUGH THE RENTS HAVE ALMOST. TRIPLED IN IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. PROBABLY MORE I'VE JUST IN MY AREA AND WE CAN'T WE HAVE I KNOW WE CAN'T KEEP UP. WITH THE LEVEL OF OF THE INCREASE IN RENTS BUT IF WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR THESE CHILDREN AND I APPRECIATE THIS SOLUTION ABOUT. THE THESE HOW SUBSIDIZE HOMES BUT ABOUT ALSO BRING STIGMA TO SOME OF THESE FAMILIES THAT YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AS SECTION EIGHT. ARM CHILD THAT'S ALSO THOUGHT THAT. DRAMATIC FOR THE CHILDREN AND IT'S ALSO EMBARRASSING AND SO I. WE WANT US TO LOOK AT THIS WITH THE BEST INTENTIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE THESE WITH THE LAST. BUT THE LEAST AMOUNT OF OF OF A STIGMA TO THE FAMILIES. AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE BOTH THE. THE COMMENT ABOUT THE US SUBSIDIZE HOMES BY. IT'S ALSO PART OF THE TRAUMA THAT WERE IMPOSING ON SOME OF THESE KIDS AND FAMILIES AT THAT NOW NOT ONLY ARE YOU ARE CAL WORKS AND CAL FRAZIER. FAMILY BUT YOU'RE ALSO A SECTION EIGHT FAMILY AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH THIS WITHOUT. ADDING TO THE BURDEN ONTO THESE FAMILIES I THINK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATH. SO. LET ME START OFF WITH. CORRECT IN ALL OF YOU WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. I ACCORDING TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID. WITH THAT. QUITE FRANKLY WHEN IT COMES TO ALL OF THE THE PROPOSAL'S TODAY MY BELIEF IS THAT WE NEED TO. LOOK AT WHAT WAS CUT IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND GET IT ALL BACK. BECAUSE AT THAT PERIOD OF TIME PRIOR TO THAT WE WEREN'T THE FIFTH LARGEST WE WERE BELOW THAT SO I THINK WE NEED TO STEP UP OUR GAME IS A STATE START TAKING CARE OF OUR FAMILIES. WITH THAT SAID. WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES THE STATE INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT. WITH WE WE'VE DONE THESE MEASURES THAT WOULD THESE THINGS HAS HAPPENED BUT YET WE STILL HAVE THESE HUGE GAPS. SO. WHAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE HOW HOW IS THAT ACTUALLY HELPS? VERSUS HURT VERSUS SPREAD THAT POVERTY GAP. SINCE WE HAVE DONE THAT. BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THE NUMBERS ON THAT. BECAUSE WE WHEN THAT CAME THROUGH IT WAS YOU NOW WE RISE ALL SHIPS AND MY CONCERN WAS WILL SOME OF THE SHIPS ARE GOING TO SEEK. AND A LOT OF THOSE THAT DON'T DO WELL OUR OUR FAMILIES IN POVERTY. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE JOB AND IF THEY DO GET THE JOB AND THEY GET CUT OFF THE BENEFITS THEY FALL DOWN THE CLASS. AND EVEN IN A WORSE POSITION. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE MY FAMILY HAS BEEN THERE. AND SO SICK OF OLD CRUSTY FOLKS CALLING OUR CHILDREN WELFARE BABIES BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO HAVE TWO OF THEM AT HOME. WELL NOW. I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE STRUGGLE YES AS YOU KNOW THE THE FINGER WAS IN THE BACK THANK YOU. IT. IT'S A HARD PATH. A HEARING YESTERDAY I THINK SET A LOT WITH ALL THE ACES SCORES. ONE OF MY COMMENTS IN THAT HEARING WAS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT IN MIND COURAGE AND WHAT I WANT TO SEE BACK FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE ALLEY ó ON THIS. IS A LOT OF OUR CHILDREN A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES HAVE MULTIPLE SOCIAL WORKERS THAT TRACK THEM THROUGH THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. IN DIFFERENT SILOS WE DON'T NEED FOR TWO THREE AND FOUR. DIFFERENT SOCIAL WORKERS TRACKING ONE FAMILY. COMPLETE WASTE OF FONTS. WE CAN TAKE THAT WE CAN SPREAD THAT OUT WE CAN HAVE ONE PERSON. TRACK THESE FAMILIES IN TRACK THESE CHILDREN'S THROUGH A LIFETIME. IN DECREASE CASELOADS AND MAKE SURE THAT THESE FAMILIES ARE GETTING THE ADEQUATE THE HELP THAT THEY NEED. SO LESS OF THEM ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. AND I QUITE FRANKLY THINK THAT WOULD BE A MUCH MUCH BETTER USE. OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SAID IN THE COMMITTEE THAT YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE READ TO CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES A I SAY QUITE A BED. WE SHOULD AND I YOU PROGRAM MANY HAVE TWO THREE AND FOUR SOCIAL WORKERS THAT ARE TRACKING YOUR CHILD. IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHY. THEY'RE ALL THERE AYE I KNOW THEY'RE ALL THERE BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT MY CHILDREN IN THE CARE OF ALL YOUR CHILDREN HER GOING THROUGH THESE THINGS. BUT WE DON'T NEED MULTIPLE ONES DOING THE SAME THING. BECAUSE THAT'S SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAMILY THAT COULD BE GETTING THE HELP THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY NOT GETTING. YOU COULD BE ONE MORE FAMILY. GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED MAKING SURE THAT THAT FAMILY DOESN'T FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE ARE. FAR. FAR OVERLY SIDELOAD. WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING BETWEEN THE AGENCIES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER COMMUNICATION AND THESE THINGS NEED TO BE LOOKED AT SO I. REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE NUMBERS BACK WHEN WE GET BACK IN MAY ON SOMETHING. THAT WOULD RESEMBLE A WAY TO CUT THAT BACK ORDER. FIGURE OUT OF WAY WERE WE SHOULD REFORM THAT. SO THAT WITH THESE FAMILIES ARE GETTING TAKEN CARE OF. BECAUSE I THINK EIGHT MINUTES RESOURCE. AND WE ONLY HAVE A FINITE AMOUNT EVEN THOUGH WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WE HAVE A GROWING POPULATION. IN AND WE HAVE FAMILIES AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE COURAGE TO TESTIFY TODAY. IT TAKES A LOT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND AND TAKING THE TIME AWAY FROM HER CHILDREN AND AND. BEING HERE TODAY. BUT WE NEED THOSE NUMBERS SO THOSE OF US UP ON HERE ON THE DYESS. CAN ADEQUATELY EVALUATE HOW TO SPIN THESE DOLLARS. SO I ENCOURAGE BOTH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALEJO. MISTER MEG I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. ARMED. BUT I DO WANT TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THAT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN. NEEDS TO BE SHOWN US WHILE. THANK YOU MISTER MATHESON WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO YOUR REQUEST I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THAT POINT THAT YOU COMMENTED ON FIRST. AND THE POINT THAT MR LIFE WERE MADE ABOUT THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE IN THAT. THE CREATION OF A STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT WHICH WE WERE. SPONSORS HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED ABOUT IT THE FEDERAL EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THEIR GREAT. HARM. BUT IF YOU'RE LIVING IN SUCH A STATE OF DEEP POVERTY. IT'S IT'S HOW DO YOU GET ON TO THE TRACK. YOU HAVE TO. YOU KNOW THEIR FAMILIES THAT COME TO US WITH. VERY LITTLE EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND VERY LITTLE. EDUCATIONAL HISTORY LANGUAGE. I'M ISSUES AND THE SORT OF IF YOU GREW UP IN YOU'VE LIVED A LIFE IN VERY DEEP POVERTY IN OF ALL THE STRESS THAT THE TEND INTO THAT. GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE WE CAN WE OFFER SOME GOOD SERVICES. AND WE ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE THEM BETTER. BUT GETTING OUT OF THE CRISIS OF VERY DEEP POVERTY IS IS OFTEN A PREREQUISITE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THOSE SERVICES AND THAT IF YOU GET THE SERVICES YOU CAN GET THE JOB AND THEN WHAT YOU GET THE JOB YOU GET THE BENEFIT. OF A MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE OR YOU GET THE BENEFIT OF AN EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. SO WE'VE YOU FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE FOLKS THAT YOU ENTRUSTED TO MOVE PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK. IT'S. EIGHT YOU ARM IT'S AN IMPEDIMENT TO THE TO THE GOAL OF MOVING PEOPLE FROM WELFARE TO WORK IF WE CAN'T LIFT UP. AT LEAST THAT THAT THE FLOOR IN WHICH VERY POOR FAMILIES LIVE SO THAT THEY'RE NOT EXPERIENCING SUCH A DEGREE OF TOXIC STRESS. THAT AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY IF IF TODAY'S GOAL IS WHERE MY LEVIN TONIGHT BEHIND BEATING MY KIDS. GETTING TO MY JOB IS IS. YOU KNOW. IT'S TOUGH TO TO IT TO MAKE IT A PRIORITY. AND FOR CHILDREN WHO GROW UP IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS. THE DAMAGE THAT TALKED THE TOXIC OF POVERTY DOES TO THEM PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO THEIR BRAINS WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH. MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO. THEIR EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IS POOR THEIR EMPLOYMENT. SORT OF OUTCOMES ARE POOR SO WE WANT. FAMILIES AND CAL WORKS BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SOME REALLY. POSITIVE THINGS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE ON TO HELP LOWER WAGE WORKERS HAVE A BETTER STANDARD OF LIVING. BUT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE DEPRIVATION THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY PEOPLE EVEN GET ON THE FIRST RUNG OF THE LADDER. THANK YOU NEXT WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL. PLEDGES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS RIGHT THERE I THINK THAT WAS THAT WASREALLY IMPORTANT APART IMPORTANT POINTS TO GET ACROSS THE COMMITTEE NUMBER THANK OR WITNESS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE I THINK WE ALL WE ALL HAVE OUR GOALS PARENTS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER. FOR OUR CHILDREN AND YOUR BEING HERE TODAY IS. TESTAMENT I HOPE THAT YOUR AND SOMEDAY YOUR CHILDREN APPRECIATE HOW HOW WELL YOU DID HERE AND HOW BRAVE YOU ARE AND AND THE STORY YOU TOLD BECAUSE IT TOUCHED US ALL. AND. THE CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW WE BREAK THE CYCLE HOW WE GET PEOPLE ON OF THAT FIRST RUNG OR ONTO THE TRACKS IS IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND SO? I THINK YOU HEAR FROM US THAT WE WANT TO WE WANT TO PUSH FORWARD AND GET AND GET THIS GET THIS DONE WE CAN'T WE CAN'T LET THINGS CONTINUE THE WAY THEY ARE AND. I BUT IT. SEE YOU HAVE YOU TO HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT HERE AND I WANT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. I'M GONNA AND WE'RE GONNA EVENTUALLY HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN BUT WANT TO SAY THAT IN OUR ASSEMBLY. BUDGET BLUEPRINT AT THE START OF THE YEAR WE RECOMMENDED. A COLA ADJUSTMENT FOR BOTH SS P. AS WELL AS CAL WORKS. I'M AS WAS STATED QUITE ELOQUENTLY EARLIER IT'S NOT LIKE MILKS ANY CHEAPER THAN IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR. PROGRAMS THAT ARE HELPING OUR NEEDIEST FAMILIES ARE ALSO GROWING OVER TIME SOME. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. I THINK THANK YOU. AFTER A MILITANT RETURN IT BACK OVER TO TIM JOHNSON. SO SPECIFICALLY FOR THE FINGER ALLOCATION. WE DID AND MAINTAIN STABILITY IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION COMPONENT. OF THE SINGLE I THERE WAS A YEAR OVER YEAR ALLIED DECLINED AB THIRTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION RELATED TO THE DECLINING CASELOAD AB MOSTLY EMPLOYMENT SERVICES IN CHILD CARE. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT ABSENT ANY POLICY CHANGES THAT WERE MADE FROM YEARS OF THE FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION. ADD DOLLAR DECLINE WE HAVE BEEN AT THE BUDGET ACTS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE A START LOOKING AT THE SINGLE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AND WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION A STICKLER CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO THAT WILL CONTINUE THAT WORK. AND WE ARE DOING THAT IN THAT MULTI PHASE EFFORT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE ELIGIBILITY ADMINISTRATION COMPONENT FIRST. I'M WERE RIGHT IN THE MIDST OF. WORKING ON ANALYZING SOME DATA THAT WE WORKED ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR COUNTIES. AND TO LOOK AT ELIGIBILITY ACTIVELY IN WORK PROCESSES BY AND THE VARIOUS PROCESSES APPLICATIONS AN ONGOING CASE WORK THAT THEY HAVE TO DO SO. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE TO BRING BACK IN TERMS OF SOME AND METHODOLOGY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE ELIGIBILITY COMPONENT OUT IN MAY. I'M AND THEN WE WILL RIGHT THERE FOLLOW LOOK AT EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENTS IN THE OTHER COMPONENTS WITH A SINGLE ALLOCATION TO SEE WHAT ADDITIONAL. AT AT METHODOLOGY ADJUSTMENTS WE CAN MAKE I'M WILL BE ENGAGING IN ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATION ALONG THE WAY AS THIS EVOLVES AB BUT OUR FIRST STEP WAS REALLY LOOKING AT THE STATE ADMINISTRATION DATA AS WELL AS THE COUNTY DATA THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED. GIVE MATH WE ARE PREGNANT. THANK YOU FRANK MAC AGAIN WITH THE WTA AND. WERE ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO RESTORE ABOUT FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SINGLE ALLOCATION FUNDING THAT THE COUNTIES RECEIVE LAST YEAR AND WHAT THEY WOULD GET NEXT YEAR BASED ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE SINGLE ALLOCATION IS THAT IT'S THE FUNDING THE COUNTIES RECEIVE. TO MAKE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE DISTRIBUTE ASSISTANCE DO EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND CAL WORKS CHILD CARE. IF YOU RECALL GOING BACK TO LAST YEAR'S ME REVISION ON LAST YEAR'S MAY REVISION AND FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. WOULD HAVE CUT COUNTIES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS YEAR OVER YEAR. ON TOP OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS THE YEAR BEFORE AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING IS BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION. WITH A RAPID DECLINING CASELOAD AND WE HAVE A CASE LOAD DRIVEN FORMULA. IT'S HYPERSENSITIVE ARM TO SWINGS IN THE ECONOMY SORROW DURING THE RECESSION CASELOAD SKYROCKETED AND YOU BUDGETED A LOT OF MONEY FOR. A FOR SERVICES MORE THAN WE COULD SPENT AND SO WHAT WE DIDN'T SPEND. WE WOULD WE GAVE BACK. BECAUSE SIMPLY. IAN OF BARACK GIANT BUREAUCRACIES THAT RUN THESE. HUGE PROGRAMS WERE NOT THAT NIMBLE ARM AND THEN WE'VE HAD A RAPID ECONOMIC EXPANSION WHICH HAS CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT CASELOAD DECLINE AND WE SEE THE SHIFT ON THE OTHER END THE PENDULUM SWING FROM THE OTHER WAY. AND LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND THREE MILLION OR SO OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN THE MAY REVISION AND ASK THE STATE TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES ON A NEW BUDGETING METHODOLOGY. WERE WERE HAVING REALLY EXCELLENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SS INDIO HAPPEN REALLY APPRECIATE. ARM THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS AS MS JOHNSON POINTED OUT THE BUDGET THAT WAS PROPOSED IN JANUARY DOES REDUCE. THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES PORTION OF THE SINGLE ALLOCATION BASED ON A A CASELOAD REDUCTION. IT'S IT'S OUR GOAL IN OUR REQUEST THAT WE JUST HOLD FUNDING FLAT UNTIL THE NEW METHODOLOGY CAN BE PUT IN PLACE. THAT THE CUT ON THE TABLE AND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET IN ADDITION TO THE CAUGHT LAST YEAR ON TOP OF THE CUT THE YEAR BEFORE. HAS PUT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE PLACE WHERE WE'RE MAKING DANGEROUS AN UNHELPFUL CUTS TO THE PROGRAM. WERE REDUCING THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR CUTTING BACK ON ELIGIBILITY STAFF IT'S TAKING LONGER FOR PEOPLE. TO GET ON THE PROGRAM. AND. WHILE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR PREPARING FOR THE RAINY DAY. WE'RE PUTTING MONEY AWAY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT NEXT RECESSION IS COMING. YET THAT THE WELFARE INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR THAT MOMENT BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE NOT CREATED THAT QUESTION. ARM AND WHEN THAT NEXT RECESSION COMES THE RECESSION THE GOVERNOR TALKS ABOUT EVERY JANUARY IN ITS PRESENTATION AND WE WILL NOT BE PREPARED. BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE TAKEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BELOW THE MINIMUM LEVEL. ON THAT'S NECESSARY THESE ARE THIS IS YOU KNOW AN ARGUMENT THAT WE MADE LAST YEAR THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION IS BANNED. ARMED SUPPORTIVE OF A OF THE NOTION OF COMING UP WITH A BETTER WAY TO BUDGET SO WE DON'T HAVE THESE BIG PENDULUM SWINGS. FOR ASKING TODAY IS LET'S NOT MAKE IT WORSE UNTIL WE COME UP WITH THAT NEW METHODOLOGY WE HOPE TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIONAND AND AND THAT DEVELOPMENT OF THE MAY REVISION. ARM BUT SORT OF BOTTOM LINE WE REALLY URGE TO SORT OF HOLD THE LINE KEEP FUNDING FLAT UNTIL WE CAN PUT A BETTER METHODOLOGY IN PLACE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THANK YOU. NEXT WE WILL HAVE SALINAS. THEN IT. I'D LOST IT RIGHT. FOR ME TO PRIOR. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SELENA PRIOR AND I AM GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ADVOCATE FOR SEIU. SEIU REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF ELIGIBILITY AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICE WORKERS ACROSS THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT STATEWIDE. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING. ME HERE TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE WORKFORCE THAT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WHO TURNED TO US IN THEIR TIME OF NEED AND CRISIS. WHILE HEADLINES MAY TELL YOU THAT ECONOMIC RECOVERY CAME TO CALIFORNIA A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THE STATE ECONOMY IS DOING WELL I CAN TELL YOU WHAT OUR MEMBERS SEE EVERYDAY. AND IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STORY FOR SO MANY FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CUT WILL HURT FAMILIES AND TAKE AWAY ESSENTIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS AND HELP FAMILIES REACH SELF SUFFICIENCY. LAST YEAR IT WAS AGREED THAT WE WOULD SIT DOWN WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO DEVELOP A FUNDING METHODOLOGY THAT MORE APPROPRIATELY REFLECTED THE NEEDS AND REALITY OF THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. WE WERE SHOCKED TO SEE ANOTHER CUT AND THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PROPOSAL. LET'S BE CLEAR THE FAMILIES WHO TURN A COW WORKS PROGRAM NEED HELP. THEY HAVE REACHED ROCK BOTTOM AND THEY COME INTO COUNTY OFFICES SEEKING ASSISTANCE. JUST TO COVER BASIC NECESSITIES TO CARE FOR THEIR FAMILIES. IF YOU REMEMBER ONE POINT TODAY PLEASE HEAR THIS. CASELOADS DO NOT EQUAL WORKFLOW. CASELOAD THE NUMBER OF CASES DOES NOT PAIN INACTION AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE AMOUNT OF WORK IT TAKES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF EACH FAMILY. EACH CASE REPRESENTS A UNIQUE FAMILY WITH UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED IS CALLED WORKLOAD. EACH CASE IS INTENSE AS FAMILY OF ARE DEALING WITH DIFFICULT SITUATIONS AND MANY BARRIERS THIS IS WHY THE CURRENT DECADES OLD METHODOLOGY IS FLAWED. WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING BARRIERS THERE IS NO ONE SIZE FITS ALL MODEL. THE MORE TIME WORKERS BEEN WITH INDIVIDUALS THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE ABLE TO REMOVE BARRIERS SUCH AS LACK OF HOUSING. CHILD CARE TRANSPORTATION EDUCATION. HEALTHCARE NEEDS AN OVERALL EMPLOYMENT PREPARATION. AND ALSO TO TO SO THAT THEY CAN HELP THEM MEET THEIR. SELF SUFFICIENCY. CUTS MEAN REDUCTION OF STAFF AND EVEN LAYOFFS THE END RESULT IS A SEVERE UNDER STAFFING IN LAS OF SERVICES AND BENEFITS WHEN THEY ARE NEEDED MOST. SOME FAMILIES WILL FALL THROUGH THE CRACK THE CRACKS AND THE RESULT IS COMPLETE DEVASTATION. CALIFORNIA WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FULLY ERADICATE POVERTY WITHOUT ADEQUATELY RESOURCING SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT ARE MEANT TO CATCH FAMILIES WHEN THEY FALL. WE MUST SUPPORT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ON AND THE CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS NOW OR WE WILL NO DOUBT PAY FOR IT LATER AND AT A GREATER COST WHEN CHILDREN TODAY BECOME ADULTS OF TOMORROW WHO ARE STILL IN POVERTY. TODAY I'M ASKING YOU TO REJECT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO CUT CAO WHAT SINGLE APPLICATION BY FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. AND ALSO TO HONOR THE AGREEMENT MAY LAST YEAR BY ALLOWING STAKEHOLDERS THE TIME TO DEVELOP AN ACCURATE BUDGETING METHODOLOGY BEFORE REDUCING SINGLE APPLICATION THINKING. NEXT THE PERMANENT FINANCE ILIO. A. TURN FINANCE TERRORISM THINK WE WOULD JUST NOTE IN THE CONTEXT THIS CONVERSATION. FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR DECREASE IS. CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A PLACE HOLDER IN THIS INSTANCE WITH REGARD TO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS AT DSS CODA IN THE COUNTIES TO. RIGHT SIZE A SINGLE ALLOCATION AND DEVELOP SOME NEW METHODOLOGY SURROUNDING ELIGIBILITY COMPONENT ESPECIALLY IN THE NEAR TERM. AND WE FULLY INTEND TO PROPOSE SENATE MAYOR VISION. THANK YOU SIR. MU TAZ ALMOST LET ANALYST'S OFFICE. ACCUSE ME. TACKLE SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SINGLE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS IN THIS PERIOD OF TRANSITION. AND I DO THAT WILL BE WORKING BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND YOUR STAFF COME MAY TO EVALUATE THE UPDATED METHODOLOGY AND PROVIDE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE AT THIS TIME. WELL MISTER CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND WE ALSO SUPPORT THE REQUEST FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE SINGLE ALLOCATION. ON IN ADDITION TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY A CI YOU BY THE WELFARE DIRECTORS. I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST FUNDING SOURCE THAT PROVIDES THE SERVICES THAT OUR FAMILIES DEPEND ON TO REALLY GET THROUGH THE WELFARE TO WORK PROGRAM MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE TRANSPORTATION AND THEY HAVE BOOKS FOR SCHOOL AND BE ABLE TO DO THOUGH AND OTHER THINGS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR MEET THE WORK REQUIREMENTS. COME WE'RE GLAD TO HEAR FROM FINANCE THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING OUT WITH HOPEFULLY PROPOSAL MAY REVISE THAT WILL RIGHT SIZE THIS IS THEY SAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT IT MAY IN MAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF OF SAN MATEO COUNTY IN SUPPORT OF CWD IS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU JOHN A SITTING ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF RESTORING THE COWARDS THING LOCATION FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU.

ON PAGE NINETEEN SHOWS THE NUMBER OF CALYX HOMELESS FAMILIES. AND IT'S A FLUCTUATION OF RENT INCREASES AND AS YOU SEE THE COWARDS GRANTS ARE FOLLOWING VERY SHORT. FAMILIES COULD FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS IF WE DON'T HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE. WITH IMMEDIATE SUPPORT TO PREVENT THEM FROM. LOSING THEIR APARTMENT ARE LOSING THEIR HOUSING SO WE URGENTLY NEED THE SUPPORT NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OF THESE FAMILIES ARE GOING THROUGH SO MANY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES. THANK YOU. REBECCA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER WE ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT THE CW DE A PROPOSAL AND I ALSO WANT TO CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MISS PRIOR THANK YOU. JUSTIN GARRETT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL TO RESTORE THE PROPOSED CUT TO THE SCENE ALLOCATION I'M WE ALSO APPRECIATE. THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO REVISING THE METHODOLOGY ENSURING ALIGNMENT BETWEEN COUNTY COSTS IN STATE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. I'M WE THINK IT'S PRUDENT TO KEEP FUNDING STABLE TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NOT FOR THEIR SERVICE AND STAFFING REDUCTIONS ON TO ENSURE. COUNTIES ADEQUATELY PREPARED FOR THE NEXT RECESSION AND TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THESE ONGOING METHODOLOGY DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU. SIR.

NICOLE ORNAMENT ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE RESTORATION. THE GAME. ANDERSON CATHARINE CESSATION OF BANKS IN SUPPORT OF THE RESTORATION WE DON'T WANNA BE PICKING UP THE SLACK THE SIMILES ARE FORCED TO SERVICES THINK. THANK YOU SIR. SEE NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY. COMMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SEEING NONE. MAYBE IT'S FAIR IT SEEMED LIKE THE DEPARTMENT WAS SAYING. THAT THE PROPOSED SINGLE ALLOCATION REDUCTION WILL BE RESTORED AS PART OF THE MAY REVISION. I JUST ASK THAT FINANCE DSS. BE ENGAGED PER THE AGREEMENT WE HAD AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND BOND ISSUE FOR IF HE'S GOOD NNOVA. ARE. PLEASE GO AHEAD YOU MISTER WHAT OF. THE NEXT ITEM IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR. A HOME VISITING A DEMONSTRATION AS PART OF CAL WORKS PROGRAM ON I'M GONNA ASK OF MS JOHNSON JUSTICE WITH. HIGHLIGHTED. CAN JOHNSON APARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE AT TWENTY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE AT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. FOR HOME VISITING INITIATIVE IN THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM. WHILE THE CAO WORKS PROGRAM. REQUIRES PARTICIPATION PERMITTIVITY IS THERE ARE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWO THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO WORK AND. I WOULD REALLY WANT TO WORK TO ENGAGE THOSE FAMILIES ARE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN WE DO UNTIL THEY. ARE AT NO LONGER EXEMPTED FROM THAT REQUIREMENTS SO. I'M THIS PROPOSAL IS LOOKING AT THAT POPULATION AS WELL AS A CHILD ONLY CASELOAD TO SEE WHAT WE CAN REALLY DO TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO WORK AND PROVIDE SOME SUPPORTS IN TERMS OF PARENTING. FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND SO ON. WE ARE. LOOKING AT AYE LEVERAGING EXISTING HOME VISITING EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE SO WE DO SEE THIS AS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THOSE HOME VISITING ORGANIZATIONS AND ARE COUNTIES AND. I'M OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A AT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE AROUND THE EFFICACY OF HOME VISITING I'M AS IT'S. CURRENTLY IN PLACE WITH A LOT OF EFFORTS HAPPENING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH IN THEM ETERNAL INFINITE EARLY CHILDHOOD HOME VISITING PROGRAMS SO FORTH. AND REALLY WHAT WE WANT TO EVALUATE IN THE THREE YEARS OF THIS I'M INITIATIVE IS TO TO DETERMINE IF. ENGAGING THESE FAMILIES WITH HOME VISITING MAKES A DIFFERENCE UP ESSENTIALLY THEIR READINESS TO ENGAGE IN THE FULL ARRAY OF THE SERVICES UNDER CAL WORKS PROGRAM. AND THAT'S AND THAT'S WHAT WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE BR EVALUATION. WE ARE HOPING THAT WE WOULD ON AVERAGE SERVE SOMEWHERE AROUND SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES AB PER MONTH. IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION WERE TARGETING IN OUR EFFORT WHICH AGAIN IS YOUNG PARENTS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE FIRST TIME PARENTS ARE PREGNANT. WE THERE'S ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND FAMILIES ALONE WITHIN THE COWARDS CLEVELAND ELIGIBLE SO AGAIN WE WE KNOW THE INVESTMENTS AND HOME VISITING THAT ARE. OCCURRING TODAY I DON'T QUITE MEET THE NEED WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL WE REALLY HOPING TO ENGAGE. AT LEAST AT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES A MONTH AND IT'S VOLUNTARY FOR BOTH THE OUR FAMILY AS WELL AS OPTIONAL FOR THE COUNTIES TO OPT IN IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL SO HAPPY AND ANSWER A QUESTION. ABOUT IT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANNA FIRST THOUGHT START BY THINKING THE ADMINISTRATION FOR INCLUDING. A HOME VISITING PROPOSAL. AND RESPECTFULLY URGE THE ADOPTION OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S PROPOSED CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AND UND. AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND VOLUNTARY EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES. THE COW WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE WILL STRENGTHEN THE YOUNGEST CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHILE ALSO ENHANCING THE IMPACTS OF CAL WORKS ALTHOUGH UNMET BASIC NEEDS ADVERSE EXPERIENCES AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. CAN UNDERMINE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF FAMILIES. VOLUNTARY EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR BOTH PARENTS AND CHILDREN IN STE COUNTLESS WAYS. THESE PROGRAMS CAN GENERATE PUBLIC SAVINGS BY INCREASING HEALTHY BIRTHS. BOOSTING POSITIVE PARENTING PRACTICES REDUCING CHILD MALTREATMENT INCREASING FAMILY SELF SUFFICIENCY IN THE FORMS OF ADULT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. CAREER TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT. THE COW WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AS PROPOSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. WOULD ALLOW COUNTY HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES TO PARTNER WITH OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES AND COMPUTER COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. TO OFFER EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS TO FIRST TIME PARENTS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE PARTICIPATING AND CAL WORKS. WHO ARE PREGNANT OR PARENTING A CHILD UNDER TWO YEARS OF AGE? I URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND ADDITIONALLY URGE ADOPTING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS. TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING INITIATIVE. ALLOCATE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION TO EXTEND AND ENHANCE THE REACH OF THE SERVICES TO CAL WORKS FAMILIES BEYOND FIRST TIME PARENTS. UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE. TO PROVIDE ONE TIME ALLOWANCES OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PARTICIPATING FAMILY IN THE FORM OF A NEW PARENT SUPPORT.

THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE NEWS FAMILY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM ITS SUPPORT AT EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING THAT HELPS BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. BECAUSE OF NF P. AND HOME VISITING MY DAUGHTER AND I ARE THRIVING TODAY AND I AM A PROUD CULTURE COLLEGE GRADUATE. MY NAME IS FOR IDEA AND I AM A GRADUATE OF THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM DELIVERED BY SOLANO COUNTIES KNOWS FAMILY PARTNERSHIP IN FAIRFIELD CALIFORNIA. I AM THE PROUD MOTHER OF MY DAUGHTER WHO IS NOW SIX YEARS OLD. AS A CLIENT I RECEIVE REGULAR VISITS ABOUT EVERY OTHER WEEK FROM MY NFP NERDS HOME VISITOR RHONDA STARTING WHEN I WAS JUST FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT. WHEN I WAS TWENTY SIX YEARS OLD LIVING IN FAIRFIELD I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT WITH MY DYING DAY. FROM THE BEGINNING I WAS TOLD THAT I HAD A HIGH RISK PREGNANCY AND I FOUND MYSELF IN THE HOSPITAL AT SIXTEEN WEEKS PREGNANT AND THEN AGAIN AT TWENTY WEEKS. I HAD NUMEROUS HOSPITAL VISITS INTO EMISSIONS DURING MY PREGNANCY. I WAS A FIRST TIME MOM AND TO HAVE SUCH A DRAMATIC HIGHWAYS PREGNANCY WAS STRESSFUL. I HEARD ABOUT THE NFP PROGRAM DURING ONE OF MY HOSPITAL STAYS. A SOCIAL WORKER ASKED ME IF I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SOLANO COUNTY IS THERE'S FAMILY PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. WHEN THERE'S WILL COME TO MY HOME ON A REGULAR BASIS DAME PREGNANCY AND THROUGH MY CHILD SECOND BIRTHDAY. I MUST SAY THAT I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT HAVING HOME VISITING NURSE WHO WOULD MEET WITH ME AT MY HOME INSTEAD OF ME BEING IN THE HOSPITAL. MY FIRST THOUGHTS WHERE THAT THIS NURSE WAS GOING TO BE CHECKING ON ME MY VITALS IN THE BABY. HOWEVER I WAS SHOCKED THAT HE WAS SO MUCH MORE. MINERS RUN THAT PROVIDED ME WITH ONE ON ONE PAINTING CLASSES AND IS A POP A SOLID SUPPORT SYSTEM. BONTA CONNECTED ME WITH RESOURCES ABOUT MY PREGNANCY CHILDBIRTH BREAST FEEDING CHILD DEVELOPMENT PARENTING AND GOAL SETTING. SOON AFTER DOING THAT PROGRAM MY NFP NURSE RHONDA IDENTIFY MY MOVES AT RISK FOR DEPRESSION WHICH WAS TRIGGERED BY MY PREGNANCY. I WAS REFERRED TO COUNSELING WITH ROBIN A HOME VISITING SOCIAL WORKER. BETWEEN MY ENOUGH SHAPE THE TRAJECTORY OF MY LIFE. ON OCTOBER SIXTY THOUSAND ELEVEN MY LIFE CHANGED. MY BABY GIRL WAS BORN AT THIRTY FIVE WEEKS SHE WAS LETHARGIC AND HAD A FEVER AND SPENT TIME IN THE NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT.

SEMI MY NEXT STEPS AS AN ADULT AND SINGLE MOTHER WHERE LIMIT SAID. PART SUING A HIGHER EDUCATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ME BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT ADDED ENOUGH COLLEGE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO. LIKELY I HAD NASH RHONDA IN SOCIAL WORKER ROBIN TO TEND TO FOR ENCOURAGEMENT. BOTH OF THEM ENCOURAGED ME TO PURSUE MY EDUCATION. ON MY OWN I LIVE NEVER THOUGHT BEING A SINGLE MOM AND OBTAINING A DEGREE WOULD BE POSSIBLE BUT THE TWO OF THEM MADE IT REALISTIC FOR ME EVEN WHEN I THOUGHT IT WAS OUT OF REACH. THEY BOTH MADE ME FEEL LIKE I COULD DO IT IT WAS A VERY EMPOWERING. THEY'RE ABLE TO SHOW ME THAT YOU CAN SET GOALS ACHIEVE THEM AND MAKE THEM WORK. HAVING MY OWN PERSONAL HOME VISITING TEAM WAS VERY INSPIRING SPENDING TIME WITH THEM MADE ME REALIZE THAT ONE AWAY WITH MONTH INMY COMMUNITY JUST LIKE MYSELF IN GIVE BACK TO THEM. I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO FIND MEANING IN EVERYTHING THAT I DO. MY SOCIAL WORKER ROBIN DISCUSSED A PROGRAM CALLED BLACK INFANT HEALTH BE AYE AGE WHICH AIMS TO IMPROVE BIRTH OUTCOMES AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS AND BABIES. I CREATED A GOAL TO WORK FOR BE AYE EIGHT. NOT ONLY DID I GRADUATE FROM NFP WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS TWO YEARS OLD BUT ALSO FROM COLLEGE. OBTAINING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN WITH A FOUR POINT OH GPA. IF YOU WOULD HAVE NEVER TOLD ME AT THIRTY FOUR YEARS OLD I WOULD BE A SINGLE MOM. WORKING FULL TIME WITH A DEGREE IN PURSUING ANOTHER DECREE A NOT BELIEVE YOU HOWEVER HERE I AM IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY ENCOMPASSING ALL THOSE THINGS. NINE A FULL TIME FAMILY HEALTH ADVOCATE FOR THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. I FEEL LIKE THIS POSITION IS DEATHLY GIVING BACK WHAT WAS GIVEN TO ME AND IS AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY I WAS SET UP BY RHONDA AND ROBIN. WHEN I GOT THE JOB I CALLED ROBIN AND I CRIED BECAUSE OF MY SUCCESS. NOW I AM PURSUING A MASTER'S DEGREE TO BECOME A LICENSED COUNSELING. THEN NFP PROGRAM NOT ONLY HELP ME AS A MOM BUT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. HELP ME BETTER MYSELF AND NOT IN A POSITION THAT ALWAYS WANTED TO BE AND. I FELT LIKE SO MUCH HAS CHANGED SINCE I ENTERED THE PROGRAM A FEW YEARS AGO. IT'S ENCOURAGING FOR ME TO SEE HOW FAR I'VE COME. NURSE RUN OVER SO HELPFUL DURING MY PREGNANCY IN THE EARLY YEARS OF MY DAUGHTER'S LIFE. WE STILL STAY IN TOUCH UNTIL THIS DAY. HAD ONE NURSE LIKE HER WHO I COULD TRUST WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT MY HEALTH WHEN I WAS PREGNANT. MY DAUGHTER'S HEALTH WHEN I WAS A NEW MOM. CHILD DEVELOPMENT AS SHE GREW AND MY CAREER GOALS HAS HELPED ME TO BE A SUCCESSFUL PARENT. I WILL CONTINUE TO SIRE MY KEY ME THROUGH BE AYE H. IMPLANTING THEM IN THE DIRECTION OF IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS AND BABIES. MY HOPE THAT IS NICE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP IS MADE AVAILABLE TO EVERY MOM THAT MEETS THIS PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM AS VALUABLE AS IT OFFERS A NEW MOM A CHANCE AT HAVING A POSITIVE FIRST TIME PAINTING EXPERIENCE. IT'S HARD BEING A NEW MOM ON YOUR OWN. NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP GIVES YOU SOMEONE TO HAVING YOUR POINT A. TO HELP YOU BE THE BEST MOM YOU CAN BE. THE NURSES RECOGNIZE YOUR STRENGTHS AND HELP YOU TO BELIEVE YOU CAN DO IT.

I WILL CONTINUE TO PAY A FIRE BY ENSURING MORE FAMILIES BENEFIT FROM ITS AMAZING SERVICE THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IMPACTS LIVES AND EMPOWERS FIRST TIME PARENTS TO BE THE BEST THEY CAN BE. I TRULY HOPE THE CALIFORNIA BUT CONTINUE SUPPORTING GREAT EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING PROGRAMS LIKENESS FAMILY PARTNERSHIP. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ANGELA ROCK FROM ALLEN HERE FROM CHILDREN NOW THINK YOU DOCTOR ARAMBULA FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. CHILDREN NOW IS A NONPROFIT PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WORKING TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIA KIDS WE WORK ON POLICY ISSUES ACROSS EDUCATION HEALTH AND CHILD WELFARE DOMAINS INCLUDING HOME VISITING. I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL UP PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR TO. IMPLEMENT THAT HOWARD'S HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AND ADDITIONALLY HE TO FIND AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM IN ORDER TO ENHANCE AND EXTENDS THE REACH OF SERVICES FOR CAL WORKS FAMILIES. INCREASING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH POINTS EARLY CHILDHOOD IS A CRUCIAL PERIOD OF TIME TO ESTABLISH CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION FOR LIFELONG HEALTH WELL BEING AND SUCCESS. AND THE SCIENCE ALSO MAKES IT CLEAR THAT RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT FUEL THIS EARLIEST BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LIFE BABY'S BRAINS ARE FORMING MORE THAN ONE MILLION NEW NEURAL CONNECTIONS EVERY SECONDS. AND WHITE SUPPORTS THAT IN THE STRONGEST WAY IS A STRONG STABLE NURTURING RELATIONSHIP WITH AN ADULT. RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT FIRST TIME YOUNG PARENTS ARE VULNERABLE AS WELL THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF THE BRAIN AND A YOUNG PERSON'S EMOTIONAL MATURITY SELF IMAGE AND JUDGMENT. ARE STILL DEVELOPING UNTIL AGE TWENTY FIVE. YET WE ALSO KNOW THAT PARENTING A VERY YOUNG CHILD PLACES% ENORMOUS PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL DEMANDS ON ADULTS. PARENTS MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED OR KNOW WHERE TO TURN FOR SUPPORT EVEN WHEN IT WAS IS WITHIN REACH IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITY. THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME TO SUPPORT FAMILIES WITH YOU WILL GENERATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THEIR SKILLS AND CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES. AND TO BEST TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN. POVERTY AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIP CAUSE STRESS FOR PARENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR FAMILY'S BASIC NEEDS AND CAN IMPACT MANY ASPECTS OF CHILDREN'S HEALTH GROWTH AND LEARNING. BUT THEY'RE PROVEN RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS THE CAN HELP FAMILIES NAVIGATE THESE OBSTACLES. CURRENTLY THEY ARE NOT REACHING ENOUGH CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. HOME VISITING PROGRAMS MATCH EXPECTANT AND NEW PARENTS WITH TRAINED PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDE FAMILY CENTERED COACHING EDUCATION SUPPORT. ON AN INDIVIDUAL VOLUNTARY BASIS. HOME VISITING REINFORCES PARENTS OWN EFFORTS AND ABILITIES TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE BEST START POSSIBLE. AND FOSTERS THE CRITICAL PARENT CHILD BOND THAT SETS THIS FOUNDATION FOR LONG TERM HEALTH WELL BEING AND SUCCESS. HOME VISITING AS DEMONSTRATED A SPECTRUM OF POSITIVE OUTCOMES THAT DEFLECT AGAINST THE WORST EFFECTS OF A FAMILY STRUGGLE WITH PROPERTY. AND PROVIDE VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN FAMILIES WITH CRITICAL AND LIFELONG PROTECTIVE FACTORS. HOME VISITING ADDITIONALLY IS VERY SCALABLE. IT'S ALIGNED SO THE BEST PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE THEIR FIDELITY CONTROLS REPLICABLE. AND THERE ARE IS A STRONG FOUNDATION OF LOCAL HOME VISITING PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE CURRENTLY FUNDED BY FEDERAL AND LOCAL SOURCES THAT STAND READY TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT IN IMPLEMENTING THIS PROGRAM. WE APPLAUD THIS COMMITTEE FOR LAST YEAR INCLUDING A SIMILAR INVESTMENT. IN THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET FOR HOME EVIDENCE BASED HOME VISITING FOR HOW WORKS FAMILIES AND WE WOULD URGE YOU THIS YEAR. TO. SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND ADDITIONALLY INVEST FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THANK YOU. THROUGH AYE BORN. NO COMMENTS. ALEJO MADE. THANK YOU OUR OFFICE. HIS NECK. OUR OFFICE REVIEWED THE GOVERNOR'S HOME VISITING INITIATIVE WE MET WITH EXPERTS REVIEWED THE LITERATURE. AND THE EVIDENCE AS IT IS IS STRONG HOMEBUILDING IT'S BEEN WELL STUDIED HISTORICALLY AND WE THINK AS A RESULT THAT'S FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE IT WARRANTS THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. WE'VE VIEW THE HOME VISITING INITIATIVE A SORT OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THE USE OF FREE DUBBED HANNAH FUNDS SO FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR ANTICIPATES THAT. THE COWARDS CASE WILL DECLINE NOTABLY. THAT FREES UP SOME TANNA FUNDS IN NEED THE BROADER CAO WORKS BUDGET. INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN. IS A UP A BRIEF TABLE. THAT SUMMARIZES THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THIS FREED UP TEN OF RESOURCES IT SOMEWHAT GREATER THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND THE CORNERSTONE IF I MENTION IS. THIS YEAR'S HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AS WELL AS THE HOME VISITING RESERVE AND OUR OFFICE WOULD POINT OUT IN THINKING ABOUT THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALIS BUT ONE APPROACH. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY NOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND DEVELOP ITS OWN PRIORITIES FOR THE TEN A PROGRAM FOR THE COVERAGE PROGRAM INSIDE THE TENT OF BUDGET. WHICH COULD INCLUDE A GREATER LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR HOME AND VISITING OR SOME OTHER. TOOK POLICY PRIORITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS BUT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOR THIS COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT ITS PRIORITIES FOR THESE FUNDS. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY BEFORE WE HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT. OFTENTIMES HELPFUL FOR US TO PUT A FACE ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND. MISS MENDOZA WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER. HAD BOTH A TEN YEAR OLD AND A TWO YEAR OLD AND UNDER THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED. BECAUSE SHE HAD ONE MORE THAN ONE CHILD. SHE ALSO WAS OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AT THE TIME SHE HAD THE SECOND CHILD AND SO THERE'S A SECOND EXCLUSION. AND REALLY WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A. PROGRAM THAT'S ROBUST AND INCLUDING ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT COULD BENEFIT. PART OF FINANCE. BERMAN FINANCED HER WORDS I THINK WE JUST NOTE THAT. I'VE GIVEN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES AVAILABLE TANNA FUNDS AND A TARGET POPULATION FOR THIS PROGRAM WE SUPPORT THE. HOME VISITING INITIATIVE AS PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

TO BE CONNECTED WITH LOCAL FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS AFTER COMPLETING THE HOME VISITATION PROGRAM TO ACCESS SERVICES AND RESOURCES AND HAVE A SUPPORT SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY AFTER THE PROGRAM ENDS. AT THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RESOURCE ASSOCIATION SIFRA HAS FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT CURRENTLY UTILIZED MODEL AND WE FOUND THAT IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL IN THE HOME VISITATION PROGRAM. IS CONNECTED WITH THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL FOR THE FAMILIES WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE PROGRAM.

WELL LAST. FINE IF THAT'S OKAY IN THE. SO WE HAVE TO PROPOSALS. I KILL WITH POSTED LE. WE CUT HIM. NO WE DON'T SURROUND THAT. IF THE UP. MY APOLOGIES MISTER CHAIR. MICRO THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THESE ARE. THE PANEL THAT WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS THE ADVOCATES PROPOSALS. ANSWER KEVIN AND I ARE GOING TO EACH HAVE A PROPOSAL TO. TALK ABOUT. THE FIRST ONE THAT I WILL DISCUSS IS THE. IS THE TIME CLOCK. FOR COWARDS. AS I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE. THAT FEDERAL CLOCK ALLOWS UNDER CANNOT ALLOW US FOR. A RECIPIENT TO STAY ON EIGHT FOR SIXTY MONTHS. ALMOST SOME TWO THIRDS OF THE STATES IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW IN FACT DO YOU HAVE A SIXTEEN MONTH TIME CLOCK. WE A AND. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. IT TIME OF SIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS FOR OUR STATE. MAYBE CHANGE THAT CLOCK AND WE WENT TO. WE MADE TWO CHANGES ACTUALLY WE WE WE STARTED THE SO CALLED TWENTY FOUR MONTH FLEXIBLE CLOCK. THAT ALLOWED RECIPIENTS APART SPEIGHT IN A WIDE RANGE OF ACTIVITIES. AND THEN AFTER THOSE TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WERE USED UP. A FAMILIES CAN HAVE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FOUR MONTHS ON ASSISTANCE THAT WAS BASED ON THE CANNIBALS. AND SO THAT'S THOUGH WORLD THAT WE'VE LIVED IN CENTS TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. WE ONLY HAVE FORTY EIGHT MONTHS ON ASSISTANCE. FOR YOU FOR A. OF A PERCENTAGE OF OUR FAMILIES A PORTION OF OUR FAMILIES THIS THIS ACTUALLY AXES OF SIGNIFICANT BARRIER. AND IT DOES SO I THINK IN TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL FOR FAMILIES WHO HAVE I THINK SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS JUST TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY PARTICIPATE ON WELFARE TO WORK. PEOPLE WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT WHOSE ENGLISH IS NOT THEIR FIRST LANGUAGE. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE THEY FREQUENTLY NEED MORE TIME JUST LIKE WE SEE WITH PEOPLE HAVE DISABILITIES WE HAVE AN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE HAVE THAT TIME THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO GET THROUGH ACTIVITIES. SO WE HAVE A OR A POPULATION THAT REALLY COULD USE NOT ONLY SIXTEEN MONTHS BUT PROBABLY BEYOND THAT IN SOME CASES BECAUSE OF THEIR. PARTICULAR SITUATIONS THAT THEY HAVE. AND THEN THE SECOND GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WE SEE THAT ARE I THINK IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE LIMIT OF A FORTIETH MONTH CLOCK. OUR FAMILY SEWER AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND IT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. I GOT THROUGH COLLEGE IN FOUR YEARS. THAT'S NOT VERY COMMON ANYMORE AND I THINK PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS WHO HAVE OTHER WORK ACTIVITIES THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET. ON THEIR PROGRESS THROUGH TO A FOUR YEAR DEGREE OR EVEN GETTING THROUGH A TWO YEAR DEGREE. CAN FREQUENTLY TAKE THREE YEARS OR MORE. I DO A LOT OF COWARDS TRAINING THAT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES LIKE AT THE MEET A LOT OF RECIPIENTS. ARM AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I GET IT EVERY SESSION IS AYE MAK MIKE I I HAVE I'M I'VE GOT A NOTICE THAT MY FORTY EIGHT MONTHS ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE. BUT THE PROGRAM THAT I MEAN THAT THE COUNTY HAS PUT ME IN. WILL I'M WILL END AFTER MY FORTY EIGHT MONTHS. WHAT SHOULD I DO? AND I LITERALLY DON'T DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THEM I HAVE NO SUGGESTION FOR THAT. HOUSEHOLD AT THIS POINT ABOUT WHAT THEY SHOULD DO I THE ONLY THING REALLY THEY CAN DO IS TRY TO GET A LEGAL SERVICE ATTORNEY. MAYBE GO BACK AND COUNT AND SEE IF THAT COUNTY ACCURATELY COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF MONTHS. BUT BEYOND THAT THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT PERSON COMPLETES THAT PROGRAM. SO FOR THESE REASONS AND I JUST THINK ON THE GROUNDS OF BASIC EQUITY AND THE FACT THAT THE. TO REMIND US ALL THAT THE DECISION TO GO TO A SIXTEEN MONTH CLOCK. WAS DONE. AS WE ELIMINATED A LIFE THERE WITH THE RIGHT TO BENEFITS OVER A PERSON'S TIME ON AID THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'RE ON A WE YOU SO NOT HAVE ANY TIME LIMIT AT ALL. SO FOR US TO GO FROM THAT A SIXTY MONTHS DOWN TO FORTY EIGHT. UM SEEMS RATHER ARBITRARY AND WE WOULD REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER. RESTORING THE SIXTY MARK TIME CLOCK FOR COWARDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CABINET THE CHORUS A CALIFORNIA WOMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. I JUST MORE AB ONE MORE THING THAT THE AVERAGE STAY ON WELFARE BUT TWENTY FIVE MONTHS. SO NOT EVERYBODY COMES TO THE SIXTH MONTH. AND PUT OF THOUGHT GOING TO THROW A WOULD HELP THOSE WHO REALLY REALLY NEED IT. PROPOSAL THAT THAT THAT A PROBLEM THAT WE'VE HAD. FOR YOU KNOW MY NUMBER OF YOURS IS PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY IN COLLEGE WHEN THEY APPLY FOR PUBLIC BENEFITS. THEY GET WHAT THEY CALL SELF INITIATED PROGRAM THE DONORS TO SIP. AND WHEN YOU ASSERT BICU GOING TO COLLEGE THEY ALLOW YOU TO CONTINUE WHAT HE STARTED RIDE THEN STOPPING WHICH JUST STARTED. IF YOU DON'T GET STUDY TIME. BUT IF YOU OUR REFER TO COLLEGE BY THE WELFARE SYSTEM. EARL IN WITHOUT BEING A SIP THEN YOU GET STUDY TIME. SO THE PROPOSAL OVER HERE IS WHY CAN'T SIPS GET WORTH THIRTY TIME AND THEY'VE ALWAYS SAID WHAT THAT WITH A TECHNICAL ERROR. IN THE LEGISLATION THOUGHT THIS IS JUST GOING TO FIX THAT INSAFE AGAINST PARTY TIME AS A REGULAR PERSON GOING TO COLLEGE. SHE ALSO GETS THIRTY TIME AS THE SIP. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO PROBABLY THINKING. LIKE I THINK FOR THE DIRECTOR ATARI. I USUALLY DIRECTOR BY MY MEMORY DOESN'T GO BACK FAR ENOUGH TO TELL WHETHER THAT WAS A TECHNICAL ERROR OR WHAT HAPPENED I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S AND. INCONSISTENCY. NO OBJECTION TO THAT THE THE ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE A PURPOSE TO HAROLD'S. COMMENTS ON THE SIXTY VERSUS FORTY EIGHT MONTHLY. IS THE IT'S A TIME LIMIT IN CALIFORNIA ON ADULTS IT'S NOT ON. CHILDREN CHILDREN REMAIN ELIGIBLE UNTIL THEY TURN EIGHTEEN OR EVEN BEYOND DEPENDING ON EDUCATION. ALL THE. SO I I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT NO BUT I MEAN THAT'S NOT TO. ARGUE. THE POINT ABOUT THERE BEING ON ADULTS WHO. WIND UP IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES PROMPTED HIM THEY. TWO GROUPS BROADLY THAT WERE BEING CHARACTERIZED. FOR FOR THOSE FOR WHOM THERE'S LIKE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY. WHO? WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING ANYWAY AND THIS IS NOT ARGUE AND SIXTY MONTHS AS WE SHOULD BE? ARE LOOKING FOR ANOTHER LONG TERM SOLUTION IN TERMS OF LINKAGE TO WITH THE SYSTEM DISABILITIES. ARM BUT CERTAINLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE FOR PEOPLE TRYING TO COMPLETE A COLLEGE DEGREE ON GETTING CLASSES. A CHALLENGE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA OF ANY COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE SIX OF THE. MICHELLE SOBRE VINCE GAGE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF BOTH A ADVOCATE PROPOSAL'S RUDE AND NOTE THAT. CHILDREN ARE ARE PART OF FAMILIES SO. MAKING SURE THAT WE GO BACK TO A SIXTEEN MONTH CLOCK IS VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU MA'AM. DIONNE AARON THERE ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AS THE ONE PERSON IN THE ROOM BUT DOES HAVE THE MEMORY. SO YOU. YOU GAVE ME AN OPENING I JUST COULDN'T. COULDN'T PASS IT UP AS ONE OF THE ALL AS ONE OF THE NOT THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL BUT AS ONE OF THE NEGOTIATORS ON THE BILL IT WAS A TECHNICAL ERROR WE NEVER HAD ANY INTENTION. OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST AGAINST SIPS VERSUS THOSE THE GATE THAT GOT THE REFERRAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OR ITS ALLIES BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THE OTHER POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT IS AS THE DIRECTOR POINTED OUT WE NEED TO BE CREATED THAT ENTITLED WEEK WE LEFT THE ENTITLEMENT FOR CHILDREN CRY. BUT THE MOMENT YOU TAKE AWAY THE GRANT FROM THE PARENT THAT AFFECTS THE CHILDREN HERE TAKING ABOUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S COMING INTO THAT FAMILY. AND SO ON WE NEED WE NEED TO RECTIFY THAT GO BACK TO SIXTY MONTHS AGAIN. I'M WE WERE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT VOTED FOR SIXTY MONTHS IN THE FIRST PLACE HYPE THE FEDS DID THAT. ARMY IN AN EXCHANGE THAT SOME OF US WERE VERY UPSET ABOUT IN THOSE YEARS WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT ARM BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO SIXTY MONTHS AGAIN THOSE FAMILIES THAT ARE SITTING IN COLLEGE. AS YOU JUST SAID. ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE WHEN WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND FOUGHT THE PROPOSAL WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS. NOT THE DEPARTMENT WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION WAS PROPOSING TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OF MONTHS AND THAT KIND OF THING. OF THE STARS OF OUR SYSTEM AND I MEAN THE THE FIPS WOULD COME UP AND TESTIFY RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANING THE MEANING OF WHAT IT MEANT TO BE ABLE TO GO TO TOOK. CHICKEN ACADEMIC IN A DEGREE AND THE FACT THAT THEY COULD GO OFF OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT I WANT. EVEN SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO TO ACHIEVE THAT AND TO ENCOURAGE IT WE SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING AND THAT'S THE WAY WE WROTE THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION WAS TO ENCOURAGE THAT. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANTED TO RECOGNIZE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER THE ON AIR ENORMOUS WHILE. YOUR EXPERTISE HERE. SHANTI PRASAD ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMUNITY FOOD BANK IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. PENNY COVER IS A CESSATION OF IT BANKS IN SUPPORT OF OF PROPOSALS. SIR. IT'S ME AGAIN SELENA PIRACY ES UN SUPPORT. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY QUESTION. I WOULD HAVE A COMMENT. NEITHER OF THESE PROPOSALS HAVE COST ESTIMATES I WAS WONDERING IF. DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO HELP US IN PROVIDING A COST ESTIMATE. OVER THE NEXT MONTH OR SO. SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO DELIBERATE. WE CERTAINLY WORK WITH PUBLIC FINANCING. ABSOLUTELY FIGHTS CAN. GREAT THANK YOU WOULD BE GLAD TO WORK WITH THEM. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. I'M GOING TO BE JOINED BY TODD PLANNED OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR FAMILY ENGAGEMENT APARTMENT DIVISIONS ARM. LET ME QUICKLY START OUT ON THIS SURE THERE'S LONG JOURNEY COMING TO THE. ARM AS YOU KNOW ON BOTH BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA IF IT IS A GOOD IDEA. THE FINGERPRINTING SYSTEM IS GOING TO AND FOR CAL WORKS RECIPIENTS ON OR APPLICANTS. ALL AT THE END OF JUNE. THE. IN THE COURSE OF. PLANNING FOR ENDING IT WE LOOKED AT SOME POSSIBILITIES OF USING SOME AUTOMATION SYSTEMS TO SEE IF WE COULD SIMPLIFY. AND MAKE IT EASIER AND LESS PAPER BURDENSOME FOR SOME PEOPLE TO APPLY. HARM THAT BECAME A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE IT MADE SENSE NOT TO PURSUE IT. MOVE IN THE SPIRIT OF COMEDY. ARM AND SO WE WILL BE WHAT WE INTEND TO DO IS. RETAIN CURRENT PROCEDURE OF FOR ALL APPLICANTS AND. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE FUTURE POSSIBILITIES TO. OFFER. PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE. AUTOMATED SYSTEMS ETCETERA FOR IDENTIFICATION WE WILL ADDRESS THAT IN THE WORK BEING. LORD. YEAH WITH A UNIVERSAL WORK WITH AN APPLICATION. AND. LEAVE THAT THERE. M. NEXT ON MY AGENDA HAVE MIKE HERALD WITH WESTERN CENTER LAN PARTY. UNLESS MISTER BLAND AT SOMETHING WANTED AT NOT ONLY ECHO THE. THOUGHTS OF THE DIRECTOR THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COMMON GROUND HERE ON THE ENDING OF US FOR US AND. ESSENTIALLY WILL BE PUTTING FORWARD IN ALL COUNTY LETTER ALONG THE LINES MISTER LIKE BORN JUST SAID OF SENSUALLY CONTINUING THE CURRENT PRACTICE. RESPECTED IN PERSON. VERIFICATIONS. NOPE NO KBA SYSTEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN MIKE CARROLL WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY UP FIRST SO I JUST WANNA. PLEASED TO HEAR THE ADMINISTRATION. SAY THAT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE PURSUING THE KBA SYSTEM. WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THE DEPARTMENT OVER THE LAST YEAR MANY OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE TO STAFF INCLUDED. AND WE THINK. THIS ACTUALLY VERY GOOD NEWS AND THAT THE STAKEHOLDERS HOPE WE NOW CAN WORK FOR TOWARDS. COMPROMISE. TO GO AWAY TO MOVE FORWARD. THAT WILL MAINTAIN BALLPARK STRONG PROGRAM INTEGRITY STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. AT THE SAME TIME ALSO POTENTIALLY DELIVER. ON THE PROMISE OF GETTING WELFARE BENEFITS IMPROVE MORE QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY AND ACCURATELY OVERTIME. SO JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS THOUGH IS WE GO FOR IT I AS WE GO INTO THAT PROCESS I WANTED TO KNOW. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REALLY STRIVING FOR IN THIS PROCESS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROGRAM'S REALLY. ON TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME. WEEK I THINK IN THE PAST IT WOULD BE FAIR TO SAY THAT AND I'VE HEARD MR AMERICAN OTHER OF VENUES MAKE THE FOLLOWING COMMENT. THAT IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT MEDI CAL HAS SOMEWHAT FEWER RULES THEN THE SNAP PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW IT'S CAL FRESH. AND THAT THE WILL POWER TO PROGRAM THE TANF PROGRAM HAS MANY MORE RULES THAN THE THAN THE SNAP PROGRAM MORE THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM IS. AND A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE. OF SORT OF A BIAS THAT HAS. WE CREATED OVER TIME TOWARDS CASH ASSIST. AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT BIAS IS I THINK. A LEGACY THAT WE ALL LIVE WITH IN CALIFORNIA AND FRANKLY ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WANT TO MOVE FORWARD AS WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND MAKING THOSE DETERMINATIONS. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REALLY IS NO BIAS THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT CAST. ANY DIFFERENTLY THAN WE LOOK AT SNAP BENEFIT FROM EBT CARD OR A MEDI CAL CARD LIKE THEY ARE ALL THEY SHOULD ALL BE TREATED THE SAME. IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND THE SHALL BE TREATED THE SAME WAY BY CLIENTS AND SO THAT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS THE HAVE REALLY SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS AROUND PROGRAM INTEGRITY THAT WOULD APPLY ACROSS THE BOARD. AND I THINK FOR US THE AYE WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT THE DEPARTMENT. MAY NOW IN THE ABSENCE OF KBA GO BACK TO REQUIRING APPLICANTS TO HAVE TO COME TO THE WELFARE OFFICE CAO WORKS APPLICANTS TO HAVE TO COME TO THE WELFARE OFFICE. TO PROVE THEIR IDENTITY NOW A FEW YEARS AGO WESTERN CENTER WAS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL S. B. NINE FORTY FIVE BY SENATOR PAN. THAT ACTUALLY CREATES A PATH FOR. THEY'RE TO BE. ONLINE APPLICATION AND FOR TO ESSENTIALLY TO GET ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THERE BE FACE TO FACE INTERVIEWS. SO THAT PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THIS. POTENTIAL DRAFT ACL. WOULD SEEM TO. BE INCONSISTENT WITH S. B. NINE FORTY SEVEN AND WE WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT IF THE RESPONSE STILL LIMITING KBA WAS TO CREATE ANOTHER STEP FOR RECIPIENTS TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH. WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY'LL BE A MEETING OF THE MINDS BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STAKEHOLDERS. TO FIND AN ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT DOESN'T. ASSIST APPEAR TO REOPEN THAT NEGOTIATION DISCUSSION AROUND S. B. NINE FORTY SEVEN IF I COULD CLARIFY. FOR THE COMMITTEE S. B. NINE FORTY SEVEN WAVED THE REQUIREMENT FOR FACE TO FACE INTERVIEW IT DID NOT ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT TO PRODUCE. DOCUMENTATION ESTABLISHING IDENTITY THIS THE THE DIFFERENCE AND. WHEN AS WE REFER TO CASH RATHER THAN THE OTHER BENEFITS IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE THINKING ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO SEEK THE BENEFIT. ARE IN ANY WAY. LESS GOOD LESS WORTHY. IT IS THAT. THE SNAP BENEFIT AND THE MEDICAID BENEFIT. CANNOT BE CONVERTED TO CASH EXCEPT ACTUALLY BUT THE MEDICAL PROFESSION IN ONE INSTANCE OF RETAILERS ON THE OTHER AND IN BOTH CASES THAT LEGAL BRIGHT TRAIL BEHIND. AND WE IN THE OIG AND D. H. CS MEDICAID FRAUD GOAL AFTER. THE CASH PROGRAM IS A TARGET FOR THE SOPHISTICATED. CYBER CRIMINALS WEEK WEEK WE HAVE. CURRENTLY EXPERIENCES WHERE WE ARE HAVING OUR CLIENTS BESIEGED ONLINE BY VERY SOPHISTICATED SCAMS WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. IN ANY WAY IMPLY THAT IT IS THE POOR PERSON SEEKING BENEFITS. AGAINST WHOM WE ARE PROTECTING THE CASH PROGRAM CALIFORNIA HAS A THIRD. THIRD OF THE WHOLE CASH PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRIES IN CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORTED WE BELIEVE WE'VE DEFENDED. BUT WE HAVE TO DEFEND ITS INTEGRITY UP TO THIS POINT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAY WHENEVER ASKED. HOME PRESS OR PUBLIC DO I BELIEVE WE HAVE PROGRAM INTEGRITY I I'VE BEEN ABLE TO SAY YES I. DO I HAVE NO QUALMS IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE PRESERVE THE ABILITY TO GO ON SAYING THAT AND SO WITH RESPECT TO MISTER HAROLD. S. B. NOT OF MY FORTY SEVEN DID NOT. ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION AND THAT WILL BE THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION GOING FORWARD. CAROL SURE. A YEAH WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH MR LIKE PORN AYE AYE THAT'S THE CASE AND EFFECT I THINK THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB. APPOINTEE NOW WITH THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR PROVIDING IDENTIFICATION I MEAN THE REALITY IS THAT RIGHT NOW. ALL VIRTUALLY EVERY APPLICANT FOR TOWER STILL DOES HAVE TO GO TO THE WELFARE OFFICE THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO PRODUCE IDENTIFICATION THEY'RE GOING AFTER PRES. UP. A BIRTH CERTIFICATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN WE KNOW THAT AND WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT WE WHAT'S ROTH PROGRAM INTEGRITY STANDARDS AND EFFECT WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE PROOF WITHIN THE EVIDENCE THAT THE SEAT THIS PROGRAM REALLY DIDN'T PRODUCE ANY DUPLICATE AID FRAUD. THE NOT THE NUMBERS ARE EXTREMELY LOW THAT IT ACTUALLY PRODUCED AND I THINK THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM FEATURES THAT ARE BUILT IN AROUND THE FILE CLEARANCE THAT ARE OUTLINED IN YOUR ANALYSIS. AND SO I THINK. NO NO OFFENSE INTENDED TO THE DEPARTMENT. I AS I NOTED I THINK MUCH OF WHAT WE OUR LIVING WITH HERE IS A LEGACY ISSUE. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE WOULD REALLY WANT WE SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION THAT WE ADOPT THE FILE CLEARANCE PROCESS AS PART OF THE STATUTE SO THAT IT THE BONNET WE CLEAR. TO PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE AS WELL NOTES THAT WE HAVE STRONG PROGRAM INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS IN THAT WHERE WE'RE BEING VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY WERE SPENDING THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK WE WOULD ALSO DOORS. THE RECOMMENDATION OF SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE THAT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WAYS THAT THE MEDS PROGRAM CAN BE ENHANCED AND MADE BETTER. AND THEN LASTLY I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IS. THAT THERE IS THIS HUB. PROJECT ONLINE I DO THINK THAT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR ADVOCATES AND THE DEPARTMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE TO COME TOGETHER AND TO LOOK AT NEW AN IMPROVED WAYS PRESS THE OPERATOR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. THANK YOU NEXT BILL OF JANET TO SOLVE. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE WESTERN CENTER REGARDING WANTING TO OF COURSE MAINTAIN AIR INTEGRITY OF THE PROGRAM IN APPRECIATING THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. REGARDING KBA IN OUR CONCERNS I THINK FOR THOSE SAME REASONS WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS MOVE THIS PROPOSAL TO RELEASE AND ALL COUNTY LETTER. AND WE ARE SEEING FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT IS SEEKING TO PENALIZE IMMIGRANTS FOR THEIR USE OF CRITICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY BEEN IN THE PAST IN THE MEDIA AND IS ALREADY HAVING AN IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS WERE ASKING TO DESCEND ROLE AND SO WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE TAKE. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF ANY NEW BARRIERS OR ANY NEW HURDLES AND REALLY THINK ABOUT THE SPEED OF WHICH WE ARE MOVING IN WITH THESE PROPOSALS. AND BECAUSE OF THIS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE POPULATION THERE ARE FOLKS AYE THAT HAVE THEIR US CITIZEN CHILDREN THAT HAVE GRANTS. WHOSE PARENTS ARE. DO NOT HAVE IMMIGRATION STATUS AND SO WE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF CHANGE THIS QUICK CHANGE WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY BE SEEKING ASSISTANCE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR PART OF FINE FOLK PLANTS PROBABLY. PROCESS IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER LANGUAGE. AND ONCE AGAIN IF I COULD BE VERY CLEAR WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO DO. CHANGES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN CURRENT PROCEDURE OTHER THAN AND FINGERPRINT. NOTHING ELSE CHANGES. BERMAN FINANCE A LIVE. DEPARTMENT FINDS HER WHICH WE CONCUR WITH THE DEPARTMENT STATEMENT SO FAR. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. KEVIN AS THEIR KALRA SUCCUMB AFFORDABLE FOR RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGH EXTENT THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAL SHAPE PROGRAM IS THE SAME PROBLEMS WITH THE STEP PROGRAM. WE READ ABOUT HOW. THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OF HACKING OF STEP BENEFITS DISTILLING THEM AND ALL THIS SORT OF PROBLEM SO I THINK THE SAME PROBLEM EXISTS THERE. AND WITH STIFF WITH WITH A LIMITED THE THE STEP IN THE CALPERS PROGRAM AND TWENTY ELEVEN. NOTHING CHANGED PERMITTED FRAUD HAS TALKED ON UP THE STATE EARNS SO NOTHING HAS REALLY. CHANGE AND. IT WAS SUPPORT A PROGRAM THAT THEY'RE SUGGESTING THANK YOU. SHE IN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF FOOD BANKS I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE THE STAFF. FOR THE IN DEPTH ANALYSIS SUSPICIONS WERE GOING INTO THE SCOPING PROCESS IN AND HOW DISCUSS I THINK IT'S VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE THIS. AND THE RECORD AND AND THE FOOD BANKS ARE OFTENTIMES THE SITES. WHERE FOLKS ARE COMING FORWARD TO ASK TO BE DISMANTLED AND SO I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MISTER STILL ABOUT THE SENSITIVITIES COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE? THE VERY CLOSE ATTENTION AS WE BUILT THESE NEW PROCEDURES AND. SIR. SIGNAL FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND. I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR THE DISCUSSION ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN AN APPROACH THAT DOES THREE THINGS FIRST IT CODIFIES THE CURRENT FILE CLEARANCE PROCESS FOR COMMERCE. SECOND IT THAT ADOPTS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE TO EXPLORE HOW MEDS IMPROVEMENT COULD WORK IN THIRD AVOIDS ANY PREMATURE CHANGES TO REMOTE ACCESS FOR CAL WORKS APPLICANTS BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT HAS. WALKED THAT BACK A LITTLE BIT. AND IN THAT VEIN I'M GOING TO REQUEST THAT STAFF WORK TOWARDS DRAFTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CODIFY THE CURRENT PROCESS FOR US TO CONSIDER BY MAY REVISION. I AGREE WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THESE DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE IN THE LONG TERM APPLICATION HUB. DEVELOPMENT PROCESS TO WHICH THE DEPARTMENT SEEMS VERY COMMITTED WERE GLAD FOR THE WORK BEING DONE TOWARDS CREATING EASE OF APPLICATION TO THE HUB. AND WITH THAT WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE A. I THINK WE DID PAID SIR. YOU'RE RIGHT AND WERE NOW ON ISSUE NOT. TO COME OVER HERE. CHEMICALLY WAGES THEY BRANCHED OVER THE CAL THRASH. SNAP PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION THANK YOU FOR THE. EXCELLENT ALICE'S JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU ON FIRST OF ALL TREND OR DOES YOUR YEAR AGO I WAS SAYING WAS THE FIRST TIME IN FIFTEEN YEARS THE CASELOADS WERE FALLING I'M PLEASED TO REPORT. THE LAST SIX SEVEN MONTHS WE'VE BEEN FLAT WE'VE LEVELED UP EVEN AS THE POOL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE CONTINUES TO SHRINK WE APPEARED TO MAKING PROGRESS AT IN ACCESS AND RETENTION AND FINING FOLKS UP. PARTICIPATION RATE IS NOW SEVENTY TWOPERCENT ON TWENTY ELEVEN WE WERE FIFTY PERCENT SO WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND HOLDING STEADY ON OTHER. EY INDICATORS I THINK. COUPLE KEY POPULATIONS WE ALWAYS LOOK AT CHILDREN. CHILDREN MAJORITY OF OUR POPULATION WE CONTINUE TO BE WATCHING THEIR ENROLLMENT PARTICULARLY CHILDREN MAKE STATUS FAMILIES ARE SOME DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING THERE. ARE GREAT PROGRESS IN SENIORS ACROSS THE MAJOR POLICY CHANGE ON DECK FOR THIS YEAR IS THE A BY THE TIME LIMIT FOR SOME WORKING ADULTS. CURRENTLY SLATED TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CLARA AND SAN MATEO COUNTY SEPTEMBER FIRST. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION THE PROGRAMS ON PEBBLE RESPONSIVENESS TO DISASTER THIS PAST YEAR BOTH THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. A TWO POINT NINE MILLION IN THE NORTH AND FIVE POINT SEVEN IN THE SOUTH TO BOTH PEOPLE WHO ARE WITH THE PROGRAM AND PEOPLE WHO ARE ONLY WITH PACIFIC FOR A MONTH. AFTER A DISASTER. I JUST TO HIGHLIGHT MANY MANY NEW THINGS AS WE CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE PROGRAM THE STATE HUB WHICH WILL TALK ABOUT LATER WERE ALSO TACKLING INITIATIVE TO REDUCE OVER ISSUANCES IN OVERPAYMENTS WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A LONG STANDING CHALLENGE FOR CLIENTS AND COUNTIES. WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR LANGUAGE ACCESS PARTICULARLY AS WE MOVE TO MORE TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTINUE TO BE OPEN TO ALL WE'RE EXPANDING OUR ENT. EMPLOYMENT TRAINING SERVICES THE ONLINE SANTA ONLINE. RESOURCE CENTERS MENTION OF THE ANALYSIS AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT CONTINUING TO MAKE HEALTHY FOOD MORE ACCEPTABLE TO OUR HEALTHY CALTRANS INITIATIVE SO ALL THAT ON DECK FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND A YOU MENTIONED FOOD OTHER CAL FOOD PROGRAMS ANALYSIS BUT I KNOW THERE ALSO SEPARATELY LISTED SO WILL HOLD. COMMENTS ON THAT. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO AND COMMENTS ON THE ISSUE. I THOUGHT WHAT'S BERMAN OFFENSIVE THINK WE WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROVIDE ELEVEN POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOUR POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT TO ABLE BODIED ADULTS THAT DEPENDENCE AND. THE FACT THAT. THE. THE ELIMINATION THIS WAIVER WILL HAVE ON THEM COME SEPTEMBER. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE NINE AT THIS TIME. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND. WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN. AS I AM PRESENTING ON TEN ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN I WILL AWAIT ANOTHER. MEMBER COMMENT LEAVE ME OF MY CHAIR DUTIES. AND WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN. NEXT. THE A GOOD FOR ALL INVOLVED. FOR THE COMPANY. SO WILL BE JOINED IN A MINUTE FROM MY COLLEAGUE AT THE CENTER FOR IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. SHE BERRYHILL. SO TRACI PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES OUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION IS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO FOOD AND TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS BY INCREASING THEIR ACCESS TO NUTRITIOUS AND AFFORDABLE FOOD. AND WHEN WE SAY ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL OF US WHO AKE CALIFORNIA OUR HOME AND ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. CAL FRESH AND OTHER FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS MUST STRIVE TO BE INCLUSIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEED OF IMMIGRANT CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY IN OUR CURRENT CLIMATE OF FEAR. INCREASE DISCRIMINATION AND DEPORTATION OF OUR NEIGHBORS. INVESTING IN NUTRITION AND BASIC NEEDS KEEPS CHILDREN LEARNING PARENTS WORKING AND FAMILY STRONG AND ALLOWS ALL OF US TO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COMMUNITIES. CAL FIRST ANOTHER FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAM SHOULDN'T DETER OR DISCOURAGE IMMIGRANT FAMILIES MOST OF WHICH INCLUDE U. S. CITIZEN CHILDREN FROM SEEKING HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN WITH FOREIGN BORN PARENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE FOOD ASSISTANCE THAN OUR OTHER CHILDREN. IMMIGRANTS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF EMPLOYMENT THE MANY U. S. BORN CITIZENS BUT OFTEN WORK IN JOBS THAT PAY THEM LESS. AND TAXES PAID BY IMMIGRANT FAMILIES CAN HELP SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS FOR ALL PEOPLE WORKING LOW WAGE JOBS HEALTHY NUTRITION ASSISTANCE HELP THEM IN THEIR FAMILY STAY HEALTHY. THRIVE AND CONTRIBUTE TO OUR SOCIETY. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY AND URGENTLY REQUESTED DSS TO CONVENE A STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO PROACTIVELY ADDRESS HOW WE CAN PROTECT THOSE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE FOR FOODASSISTANCE SO THAT FEAR DOESN'T IMPACT THEIR DECISION TO SEEK HELP FOR THEIR FAMILIES. TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE SYSTEMS USED FOR CAL FRESH AND THE LINKAGES TO OTHER FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES. AND TO WORK TOWARDS MODERNIZING CAL FRESH TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND SO WE ASK THAT WE CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS WERE WORKING AT THE INTERSECTION OF IMMIGRATION AND FOOD. SO THAT WE CAN PROACTIVELY WORK TOWARDS A MORE INCLUSIVE VISION OF FOOD FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND NEXT WITH GINA TESLA YES GOOD AFTERNOON AT CAP SEE MY ORGANIZATION WAS ACTUALLY FOUNDED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN RESPONSE TO QUOTE UNQUOTE WELFARE REFORM AND CRUEL FEDERAL LAWS. THAT EXCLUDED NUMBER OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM PUBLIC BENEFITS PROGRAMS. THESE LAWS CAME ON THE HEELS OF PROP ONE EIGHTY SEVEN AN ANTI IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE AND TENGAN INTENDED TO TARGET SCAPEGOAT IMMIGRANTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THEN IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE ADVANCED A NUMBER OF IMMIGRATION REFORMS INCLUDING REMOVING SOME OF THOSE EXCLUSIONS FROM OUR OWN PROGRAMS HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT ARE LEFT OUT OF OUR HEALTH SYSTEM. AND SAFETY NET BECAUSE OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS TODAY OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS FACE FOOD INSECURITY WORRYING ABOUT WHEN THEY'LL GET THEIR NEXT MEAL HUNGER DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE. OUR COMMUNITIES ALSO STRUGGLED INCOME INEQUALITY IN ADDITION TO THE INCREASING ECONOMIC BARRIERS STEMMING FROM THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS. COVERAGE IS ONE OF THE MOST INTO PORTENT TOOLS TO REDUCE POVERTY AND TO IMPROVE HEALTH WHEN LOW INCOME CALL FOR MEANS REGARDLESS OF STATUS OF STATUS HAVE ACCESS TO NUTRITION ASSISTANCE WE STRENGTHEN OUR STATE. AND CREATE A STANDARD FOR FOOD ACCESS THAT ALLOWS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES TO LEAD BETTER AND HEALTHIER LIVES BECAUSE EXCLUSIONS BASED ON STATUS HURT OUR STATE. LOCKING OUT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES FROM CRITICAL ASSISTANCE NOT ONLY SETS BACK ENTIRE FAMILIES BUT IT SETS BACK OUR STATE. WE HAVE HALF OF OUR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS WE HAVE TO DO MORE TO ENSURE THAT NO CALIFORNIA GOES HUNGRY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN THE STABILITY OF FAMILIES THAT IS INTRINSICALLY LINKED. TO OUR STATE'S LONG TERM FUTURE. WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL TO BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT WILL WORK THOUGHTFULLY TOWARDS THE GOAL IS TO STRENGTHEN PROTECT AND ADVANCE POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE NEEDS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR STATE. NOT THE DESIGN A RHETORIC OF AN INCREASINGLY AVERAGE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. IT'S THE DEPARTMENT HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU I I THINK THE ONLY BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE A STUDENT BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP. OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY SENSITIVE TO. THE. POTENTIAL. REGULATORY CHANGES A FEDERAL THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND FINDING WAYS TO. MOVE AND. MAY ENSURE CONTINUED ACCESS OR INCREASE ACCESS WITHOUT CREATING JEOPARDY. AND BECAUSE. THE GOAL. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. A TIGER WOODS' PARTNER FINANCE WE'D ECHO THE SENTIMENTS OF DIRECTOR WHITE BORN THAT WE WOULD BE OPEN THE CONVERSATIONS TO THE EXTENT THIS PROPOSAL BECOMES PROPERTY FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN. MICHELLE STILL PREVENTS HE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE FOOD FOR ALL PROPOSAL THINK. THE COMMITTEE. SHANTI PRASAD ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMUNITY FOOD BANK IN STRONG SUPPORT OF FOOD FOR ALL. ANDERSON HEALTH ASSOCIATION IF IT MAKES IN SUPPORT. SIR. THIS IS NOT INNOCENT OF ALL IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION COLLABORATIVE STRONG SUPPORT. CARLY PINKEL AT THE FOOD BANK OF CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO IN STRONG SUPPORT. A HUMAN. NO IT BOTTOM WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. SERVING FARMWORKERS. CALPERS PROGRAMS WHEN THE PROGRAM IT'S UNDER UTILIZED BY FARMWORKERS AND MANY ARE MIXED AT ITS FAMILIES WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS OF EXCLUSION SO THIS IS A GOOD PROPOSAL THANK YOU. FRANK NICHOLAS YOU TO BE DETAINED SUPPORT. I JUST GOV ARE SLOW AT THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AND BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO COMMENT AFTER THE SUMMARY OF THE. CALL FRESH UPDATE JUST A DISJOINTED TAKE A MOMENT TO CONGRATULATE THE COVERAGE PROGRAM FOR THE. YOU KNOW THE RESPONSE OF THE DISASTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND. THEIR AGILE RESPONSE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES. I CAN. WE KNOW THIS ONE LOCAL ENEMY GRANTED MEAN SO CAMPESINO. YEP WILLIAMSON GLASSES. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. CREW GONNA ASK THE ADVOCATES OF I CAN'T A DRAFT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ACHIEVE THE GOALS IN YOUR PROPOSAL FOR ALL PARTIES TO CONSIDER. WITH WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO. ISSUE TEN I'M GOING TO GO. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IF IT PLEASES YOU I'D LIKE TO THE PRESENT TEN ELEVEN TWELVE AND THIRTEEN TOGETHER. I ABSOLUTELY WELL IDENTIFY THEM AS WE GO THROUGH. DESPITE THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY ONE IN A CALIFORNIA. UNFORTUNATELY FACES HUNGER. A CRISIS THAT DEMANDS THE STATE DEVELOP A PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE. WHEN INCLUDING THE STATE'S HIGH COST OF LIVING WE HAVE THE NATION'S HIGHEST POVERTY RATE. TWENTY POINT SIX PER. CALIFORNIA'S WORLD LEADING AGRICULTURAL REGIONS ARE IRONICALLY SOME OF OUR NATION'S HUNGRY OF CITIES. WITH BAKERSFIELD BEING NUMBER ONE IN MY OWN HOMETOWN OF FRESNO BEING NUMBER FIVE. CALIFORNIA SH IS OUR STATE'S MOST IMPORTANT DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER. WHILE MANY RELY ON THIS BENEFIT AMOUNTS TO LESS THAN TWO DOLLARS PER MEAL. THAN WHAT WE NEED AND THAT IS LESS THAN WHAT WE NEED TO PURCHASE A HEALTHY DIET. WITH SUCH A LOW BENEFIT NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS THAT RECEIVE SNAP STILL MUST RELY ON FOOD BANKS TO MEET THEIR MOST BASIC NEEDS FOR FOOD. THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINE INCREASED MONTHLY CAL FRESH BENEFITS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. BOOSTING THEIR PURCHASING POWER SO THAT THEY MAY HAVE BURKE HUNGER AND ALSO HELPS TO STIMULATE OUR ECONOMY. WELL THIS INCREASE IN BENEFIT ONLY LASTED A FEW YEARS IT WAS DOCUMENTED TO HAVE REDUCED HUNGER. AND INCREASE THE PURCHASES OF HEALTHY FOOD. SINCE THE ARE A BOOST TO SNAP BENEFITS WAS TERMINATED THE AVERAGE FAMILY OF THREE HAS HAD THEIR BENEFITS REDUCED BY TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A MONTH. AN INCREASE OF CAL FRESH MONTHLY BENEFITS WILL HELP REDUCE HUNGER FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS WHILE ALSO ALLOWING FOR THE PURCHASING OF HEALTHIER FOOD. WHILE ALSO INCREASING THE LOCAL ECONOMY. FOOD INSECURITY CAN BE A MAJOR RISK FACTOR TO HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING DIABETES. TWO AND A HALF MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD HAS BEEN FOUND TO HELP TO CONTROLLED. THIS DISEASE AND TO HELP IT INDIVIDUALS AND HERE TO STRICT MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS. OVER THE PAST DECADE INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS TO CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE MORE MONEY FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THEY BUY AND EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. TELL FRESH HELPS OVER FOUR MILLION PEOPLE PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. HOWEVER WITH THE BENEFIT AMOUNT IS SO LITTLE THAT LIMITS THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE MORE EXPENSIVE FRESH FOOD. SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAMS PROVIDE MATCHING DOLLARS TIED TO THE PURCHASE OF CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED LOCALLY THROUGH OUT THE STATE. TO MAXIMIZE THESE INCENTIVES WE MUST INTEGRATE CALIFORNIA'S% FRUIT AND VEGETABLE BENEFITS INTO THE CAL FRESH ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER PROGRAM. WHICH IS WIDELY ACCEPTED BY FOOD RETAILERS STATEWIDE. AS WE WORK TO INCREASE THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WE STILL HAVE HUNGRY CALIFORNIANS. NEARLY ONE THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS RELY ON FOOD BANKS FOOD BANKS ARE A KEY TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS HAVE ACCESS. TO FOOD ONE SUPPLIES RUN LOW. WE NEED TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS THAT HELP PREVENT HUNGER AND FOOD INSECURITY WHILE ALSO DEDICATING FUNDS TO INCENTIVIZE AND PROMOTE QUALITY HEALTH FOOD. PURCHASES I SUPPORT FOR SPECIFIC PROPOSALS THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S HUNGER CRISIS I'M ASKING FOR INVESTMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING. FIRST TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH ADDITIONAL CAL FRESH BENEFIT FOR EACH CAL FRESH HOUSEHOLD. THIS IS ITEM TEN. INCREASING THE MONTHLY BENEFIT IN THE PROGRAM WILL HELP PREVENT HUNGER SUPPORT HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASES STIMULATE THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE PRESSURE ON LOCAL FOOD BANK. HEALTHCARE COSTS. SECOND ISSUE ITEM ELEVEN NINE MILLION IN GENERAL FUND TO INCENTIVIZE THE PURCHASE OF CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. THIS WOULD ENABLE THE CAL FRESH EBT SYSTEM TO INTEGRATE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION BENEFITS THAT INCENTIVIZE CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PROTECTS. ADDITIONALLY IT WILL ALLOW FOR SEVEN COMMUNITY BASED PILOTS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF AN ELECTRONIC BENEFITS TRANSFER MECHANISM. TO DISBURSE AND TRACK SUPPLEMENTAL CAL FRESH BENEFITS EARNED AND REDEEMED BY CLIENTS COVER ADMINISTRATION COSTS OF NONPROFIT OPERATORS AND DESIGN AND CONDUCT A THOROUGH PILOT PROJECT EVALUATION. THIRD ITEM TWELVE TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION IN GENERAL FOOD FOR CAL FOOD. THIS WILL HELP CALIFORNIA FOOD BANKS PURCHASE MORE FRESH FOOD. CALHOUN IS INCREDIBLY EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE IN FIGHTING HUNGER BOOSTING NUTRITION AND SUPPORTING OUR FARMERS. FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO CAL FOOD ARE REQUIRED TO BE SPENT ON PURCHASING AND DISTRIBUTING FOOD GROWN OR PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. BENEFITING LOW INCOME FAMILIES WITH MORE ACCESS TO FOOD AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL SECTOR SECTOR. FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR AND CAL FOOD SPENT FIVE MEALS A CALIFORNIA GROWN FOODS ARE FUNDED. FUNDING CAL FOOD AT TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION WILL ENABLE FOOD BANKS TO DELIVER MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MILLION MEALS. A SIGNIFICANT STEP TOWARDS ENDING HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA. FINALLY ITEM THIRTEEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN GENERAL FOOD FOR FOOD BANK INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY. BESIDES SUFFICIENT FOOD THE MAIN BARRIER FOOD BANKS FACE IS INFRASTRUCTURE BOTTLENECKS THAT LIMIT THE CAPACITY TO SERVE THEIR COMMUNITY. TWENTY FIVE MILLION INVESTMENT WILL PROVIDE LONG TERM BENEFITS BY ALLOWING FOOD BANKS TO PURCHASE CLEAN BURNING REFRIGERATED TRUCKS. EXPAND COLD STORAGE OR MAKE OTHER PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS CRITICAL TO THEIR OPERATION. THIS INVESTMENT WILL ENABLE FOOD BANKS TO DISTRIBUTE MORE CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS PARTICULARLY THE HEALTHY PRODUCE AND PROTEIN ITEMS THAT KEEP. THAT MUST BE KEPT FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WITH THAT. PLEASE. WITNESSES AND. FAVOR. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITYTO SPEAK TODAY I'M CHUNKY PRASAD SENIOR POLICY ADVOCATE AT ALAMEDA COUNTY COMMUNITY FOOD BANK IN OAKLAND. AND POLICY CO CHAIR OF CALIFORNIA HUNGER ACTION COALITION WHICH IS A DEVICE DIVERSE GROUP OF ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE MISSION IS TO LIFT UP THE EXPERIENCES. OF THE OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO EXPERIENCE HUNGER. I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THESE ORGANIZATIONS THAT BELIEVE FOOD IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. I'M A FRESNO NATIVE MY GRANDPARENTS THE AMERICAN TERRACE IN AN AUDIO TO KNOCK WERE FARMWORKERS THERE AND IN ORANGE COUNTY. FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES THROUGH THE NINETEEN SIXTIES THEY RAISED FOUR CHILDREN TWO OF THEM VIETNAM VETERANS. I WAS ON THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM AS A CHILD WHEN THERE WERE ACTUAL FOOD STAMPS. NOW KNOWN AS SNAPPER CAO FRESH IN CALIFORNIA THIS PROGRAM IS. AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA SAID OUR FIRST AND MOST EFFECTIVE DEFENSE AGAINST HUNGER. YET BECAUSE CONFERENCE PROVIDES ONLY TWO DOLLARS PER MEAL IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND I WANT TO. ADD TO WHAT DOCTOR ARAMBULA SAID THAT NOT ONLY DO ONE THIRD OF HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING SNAPPED. UP MUST RELY ON FOOD BANKS BUT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WE ASK YOU BANKS CANNOT REACH MORE. PEOPLE CANNOT REACH FOOD BANKS AND THOSE PEOPLE JUST GO HUNGRY TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH. CALIFORNIANS FORTY ONE FOOD BANKS HAVE INCREASED DISTRIBUTION TO TWO MILLION POUNDS OF FOOD A YEAR YET WE'RE UNABLE TO MEET THE NEED NOT EVEN CLOSE. AND WITH THREATS OF SNAP CUTS FROM CONGRESS LOOMING CALIFORNIA MUST ACT NOW TO ALLEVIATE HUNGER. WE SUPPORT DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS PROPOSAL FOR CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE THE CAL FRESHMAN IF IT BY TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER MONTH. THE AMOUNT THAT IT WOULD BE IF CONGRESS HUTTON AND AT THE BENEFIT BOOST FROM THE AMERICAN RECOVERY AND REINVESTMENT ACT. INCREASING THIS BENEFIT WOULD BE A WIN FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IT WOULD BE INVESTMENT IN THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION OF PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM HUNGER. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AN INCREASE OF THIS AMOUNT INCREASES PARTICIPANTS VEGETABLE AND HEALTHY PROTEIN CONSUMPTION. IT WOULD ALSO BE IN A ECONOMIC INVESTMENT AS FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT IMMEDIATELY AND LOCALLY. EVERY ONE DOLLAR OF CAL FRESH FUNDS SPENT GENERATES A DOLLAR SEVENTY NINE IN THE LOCAL ECONOMY. HOW FAST CAN ALSO PROVIDE THINGS THAT FOOD BANKS CAN'T LIKE PROTEINS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO SOURCE BECAUSE OF THEIR INCREASINGLY HIGH COST? AND CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE FOOD. ULTIMATELY BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE AND PURCHASE YOUR OWN FOOD RESPECTS PEOPLE'S DIGNITY. DOCTOR ARAMBULA IS PROPOSAL IS A SENSIBLE AND REASONABLE INVESTMENT. I ASK THAT CALIFORNIA FEDERAL SNAP PROGRAM TO LEVERAGE STATE FUNDS TO BOTH BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING FROM HUNGER AND TO BOOST THE ECONOMY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. I WISH TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE MY CONCERNS REGARDING MY CAL FACE BENEFITS. MY NAME IS ELLEN JOHNS I'M SEVENTY FIVE YEARS OLD AND I LIVE IN. SAN PABLO CALIFORNIA. I CAME TO HE CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND NINE FROM THE EAST COAST. AND AT THAT TIME I WAS AT. I HAD BENEFITS IN FOOD STAMPS AND MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. PRESENTLY I GET. FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH WHEN I FIRST CAME. IT WAS AROUND A HUNDRED. AND I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT A FRIEND OF MINE IN BERKELEY WHO MADE. WHO HAD A TOTAL INCOME A MORE THAN I HAD? THOUGHT MORE FOOD STAMPS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT BUT OF COURSE WE CAN MAKE ANY. QUALMS ABOUT IT BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT MY FRIENDS BENEFITS QUESTION. I IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR A LETTER WAS SENT TO ME. AND THEY WE DO STE THE SIXTEEN DOLLAR CALIPHATE SH BENEFIT TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS. I HAVE YET TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT? AND. IN THE BEGINNING WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE THEY CONSIDERED TO INCREASING YOUR. YOUR RENT. I'M DIFFERENT EXPENSES YOU HAD. AND CALCULATED THAT INTO YOUR FOOD STAMP BENEFITS BUT THAT'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY. HOWEVER I DO KNOW THAT AT SOME POINT IF IT WE GETS REDUCED AGAMBEN APPEALING. AND DUMP SEE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT BUT I'M LEARNING MORE AND MORE WORKING WITH YOU GUYS. AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THE TO DOING. NOW FIFTEEN DOLLARS GOING IN THE SAFE WE WILL BUY YOU WHAT. YOU GUYS SHOP. WHAT DO YOU GET FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS EVEN MY? BRED. IS WHAT THREE DOLLARS A LOAF. AND AFTER BIG YOU WANT A STATE CAN FOR SOME FISH. AND SO THEREFORE. BECAUSE I'M A MOTHER OF THREE AND A PRUDENT CHOPPER IN CHAT WITH COUPONS. I I MAKE DO. SO TO SUPPLEMENT THAT. I HAD. QUESTION IN ANY S. ABOUT DIFFERENT FOOD BANK. BENEFITS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD DIFFERENT CHURCHES IN CONTRA COSTA. THAT SUPPLEMENT MY INCOME IN FORTUNATELY. FOOD BANK AND IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS A SALVATION ARMY. AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP ME ON TARGET WITH. GOOD FOOD HEALTHY FOR. LAST YEAR IBM INTO A MEDICAL PROBLEM WHERE I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY AND HAD WHAT THEY CALLED THE MY I TO ME. DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT A SAID I JUST IF. PROBLEM AND.

I DIDN'T OUT OF THAT DIABETIC SINCE I WAS LIKE IN MY LATE FORTIES. AND I WILL ALWAYS WATCH MY HEALTH BUT FRESH FOODS. AND. THE PROPER PROPER NUTRITION IS IS GOOD. SO IF YOU WILL. DO YOU NEED LIKE NUTRITIONAL DRINKS ENSURE IN THINGS LIKE THAT WHICH TAKE AWAY FROM THE MONEY SITUATION SO IF YOU SPEND THEIR MONEY FOR. THAT KIND OF SUPPLEMENT TO KEEP YOURSELF HEALTHY ESPECIALLY WITH THE. PROBLEM. A DIABETES AND THE SURGERY I HAD. I'M I'M NOT MAKING IT. AND IT'S ONLY BY THE GRACE OF NOT THAT. I'M ABLE TO. SORT A BALLOTS IN THE IN THE FOOD STAMP. FOOD BANK UP ORGANIZATION WHICH HAS BEEN WONDERFUL. SO AN INCREASE IN IN CAO FRESH WOULD REALLY BE. MORE THAN A HELP TO NOT ONLY ME BUT TO.

NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. MISTER CHAIR OF THE VERY VERY BRIEF I CAN'T SAY BETTER THAN THAT THAT PARTICULAR ON THE ON THE CAL FOOD INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES. JUST TO. BUT THAT CALVET NUMBER IN PERSPECTIVE THAT TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION IS EQUIVALENT TO WHAT THE STATE DID JUST TWO YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD THE DRUG PROGRAM. CERTAINLY THE DROUGHT IS COMING BACK. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS GIVEN THE CLIMATE OF FEAR ETCETERA SO WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS THE MINIMUM THE STATE CAN DO AND HOW TO FIVE MORE ASSISTANCE. ON INFRASTRUCTURE PIECE. JUST TO PUT A PERSPECTIVE THAT THE TOTAL NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IS ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOOD BANKS ARE ROUTINELY. AND CAPITAL CAMPAIGNS I'M DOCTOR I'M BILLS FOOD BANK FOR EXAMPLE IS KIND OF A SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ALONE RIGHT NOW AND JUST PUT THAT TWENTY FIVE IN CONTEXT REALLY JUST ASKING FOR THE STATE'S SHARE THANK YOU. MAKING ETHNIC WITNESS. THANK YOU MELISSA ROMERO IF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE CAL FOOD FUNDING. AND THE FOOD BANK INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. CARLY FINKEL AT THE FOOD BANK APPROACH ACOSTA AND SOLANO I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE CAO FRESH INCREASE BUT ALSO SPEAKING TO CAL FOODS. AND INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS ARM OUR FOOD BANK FOOD BANKS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE REALLY BEEN TRYING TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCE WE DISTRIBUTE. SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL THE WE DISTRIBUTE IS NOW PRODUCE. AND WE'VE BEEN USING THE CAL FOODS MONEY TO PURCHASE ABBOTT DISTRIBUTE FRESH PRODUCE BUT A WITH DON'T HAVE THE REFRIGERATED STORAGE CAPACITY. TO TAKE AND STORE AND DISTRIBUTE THAT MISSILE THE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS WE REALLY HELPFUL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THAT NUTRITIOUS FOODS THAT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS BUT. NO I BOTTOM ALL CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION WE CAN'T SAY IT ANY BETTER THAN. MRS JONES I MEAN A FANTASTIC WORDS YOU COVER ALL THE TOPICS. THAT AFFECT OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE POOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES A IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL'S SPECIFICALLY TO THE MISSING THE THE DROUGHT ASSISTANCEPROGRAM SO WE NEED TO BRAILLE THAT MONEY BACK IN HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY. BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THE NEXT EMERGING MAY COME SO WE NEED TO HAVE THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE RECENTLY HELEN EVENT IN STANISLAUS COUNTY WHERE WE HAD A MOBILE FOOD TRUCK. COME. AND WE GAVE AWAY ALL THE FOOD TO THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FAMILIES NO QUESTIONS ASKED THAT'S A TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY WE NEED BECAUSE WE KNOW THE NEED IS THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TRACY PATTERSON WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE CAL FRESH BENEFIT INCREASE SHALL I ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FOR INVESTABLE EVEN TEAM I WENT THERE ISSUE TO HIM RIGHT NOW. OKAY THAT THIS WITNESS WHO WANT TO GO HELP. THAT'S INCLUDED IN OKAY THOSE ISSUE LOOK AHEAD OKAY. SO. THANK YOU I WOULD WANT LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FRUIT VEGETABLE EBT PILOT AGAIN WITH CALIFORNIA FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES SO AS EVERYONE HAS MADE CLEAR THE EXTENT OF HUNGER IN CALIFORNIA IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AND THE FEDERAL COFFERS BENEFIT WHAT WHO BENEFIT IS INADEQUATE TO LAST THE MONTH. I AM IN ONE PARTICULARLY CRUEL IRONY HERE IS THE ON AFFORDABILITY OF FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN CALIFORNIA. FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE PRODUCE MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAN ANY STATE IN THE NATION YET CLOSE TO FORTY PERCENT OF LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD ENOUGH TO EAT PERIOD. I'M IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE HAD WORKED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO US AUTHORIZE CALIFORNIA LAW TO ESTABLISH THE HEALTHY FOOD PURCHASE PILOTS. THAT WOULD CREATE A SCALABLE FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PURCHASE PROGRAM INTEGRATED ON EBT. WELL THAT WAS AUTHORIZING CALIFORNIA LAW IT WAS CONTINGENT UPON THE RECEIPT OF A FEDERAL GRANTS AND WHEN THAT GRANT BECAME MADE AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY MASSACHUSETTS WITH THE LUCKY RECIPIENT OF A GRAND STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WHILE AT THAT TIME OUR LOSSES MASSACHUSETTS GAIN AT THIS POINT WE NOW HAVE SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THAT WE CAN LOOK TO IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS WHERE THEY STARTED WITH THE PILOT AND NOW HAVE A STATEWIDE EBT INTEGRATED. HEALTHY INCENTIVE PURCHASE PROGRAM AND SO RATHER THAN HAVING TO DESIGN EBT PROGRAMMING FROM SCRATCH WE CAN MODEL UPON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND PROVIDE A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH FOR THE PURCHASE OF CALIFORNIA FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THAT WILL ALLOW CALTRAIN SHOPPERS TO STRETCH THE BUDGET THROUGHOUT THE MONTH. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT SORT OF STATEWIDE EBT INTEGRATED PROGRAMS LOTS OF LOCAL WELL LEFT PROGRAMS HAVE SPRUNG UP IN FARMERS MARKETS AND SOMEONE GROCERY STORES BUT THEY ALL USE THEIR OWN DIFFERENT COUPONS AND VOUCHERS AND NAMES. AND DEFINITIONS. AND SO THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS HAVE IN SOME WAY ALMOST TAKING US BACK TO THE USE OF FOOD STAMPS I'M MORE USING VOUCHERS AND WE ARE BURKE PUTTING THOSE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND BURDENS ON THE LOCALS TO ACTUALLY PROCESS INTO ACCOUNTING WHEN THEY COULD BE DOING OUTREACH IN PROMOTION AND ALL. THE THINGS THAT LOCUSTS DO BEST. AS DOCTOR ARAMBULA NOTED THE BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AREA ARE AMONG THE TOP FROM OF HUNGER IN THE NATION AND AND AT THE SAME TIME IN THE AGAIN THE IRONY KERN COUNTY IS NOW THE TOP PRODUCING AGRICULTURAL COUNTY IN THE NATION WITH FRESNO INTO ARE CLOSE BEHIND. SO WE HAVE AGRICULTURE ABUNDANT SIDE BY SIDE WITH EXTREME HUNGER AND POVERTY I'M AND WE'RE NOT CONNECTING THE TWO. AND ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THAT BECAUSE OF THOSE LOCAL PROGRAMS ARE RELIANT ON VOUCHERS AND LOCAL PHILANTHROPY KERN COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE A SINGLE COW FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INCENTIVE PROGRAM OPERATING. I'M BY INTEGRATING ON EBT WE CAN HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE APPROACH TO REACH THE REST OF THE STATE. AND LINK OUR AGRICULTURAL STRENGTHS WITH OUR RESIDENTS NEEDS. YOU KNOW THAT BEFORE. GOOD AFTERNOON NOON CHERNYKH MANY MEMBERS MY NAMES ELISA GUESTS AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE POLICY DIRECTOR AT SPUR A NONPROFIT BASED IN THE BAY AREA. SPURS IN STRONG SUPPORT I'M COMMENTING ON ITEM ELEVEN THE EBT INTEGRATION OF INCENTIVES WEREN'T STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BUDGET REPRESSED BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'LL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE RUN A PROGRAM CALLED DOUBLE UP THE BOX DOUBLE UP FOOD BOXES OPERATING RIGHT NOW FOR THE PAST YEAR AT THREE GROCERY STORES ABOUT TO BE FIVE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. AND WHAT IT DOES IS WHEN ACT CUSTOMERS ON CAL FRESH COMES TO THE STORE AND BUYS CALIFORNIA GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES WITH THE EBT CARD THEY GET A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR MATCH THAT THEY CAN THEN SPEND ON ANY FRUITS AND VEGETABLES NEXT TIME THEY COME TO THE STORE. IN ONE YEAR WE'VE SERVED TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES PARTICIPATING IN CALPERS WHICH EQUALS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE BASED ON THE SURVEYS WE'VE GOT. THEY HAVE REDEEMED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. RESULTS FROM OUR OWN PROGRAM TRACKS THOSE WE'VE SEEN NATIONALLY AS WELL. NINETY PERCENT OF PROGRAM PERSISTENCE MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT AGREE ARE STRONGLY AGREE THAT THEY BUY MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THEY EAT MORE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND THEY CAN STRETCH THEIR FOOD BUDGETS FURTHER THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TELLING US. AND THE VAST MAJORITY HAVE ALSO SAID THAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE THIS EXPAND. OUR LONG TERM VISION IS THE SEED DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS AND PROGRAMS LIKE IT LIKE TRACY MENTION THEIR NUMBER IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW. EXPAND TO GROCERY STORES AND FARMERS MARKETS STATEWIDE SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE HEALTH FOOD SECURITY AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD MOVE THE STATE IN A STRONG STEP FORWARD TOWARD THAT LONGER TERM VISION. FOR DOUBLE UP FOOD BUCKS AND PROGRAMS LIKE TO SCALE WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT'S EASIER TO ADOPT EASY TO USE AND EASIER TO ADMINISTER. LIKE TRACY MENTION WHAT WE USE PAPER COUPONS THAT'S WHAT THAT CONFERENCE PARTICIPANTS GET FROM THE GROCER. I'M FOR THIS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND. I'M WE NEED A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS RETAILERS TO MORE SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE THE PROGRAM INTO EXISTING POINT OF SALE SYSTEMS. SOMETHING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO USE THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFITS AN INCREASE THE PROGRAMS ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICACY. THE CALPERS FRUIT AND VEGETABLE EBT PILOT A WIN WIN WIN. AT FIGHT POVERTY SUPPORTS HEALTH NUTRITION AND BOOST CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURE I COULD TALK FOR A REALLY LONG TIME DETAILS ARE BIG PICTURE ABOUT THIS AND WOULD LOVE TO. AND I HOPE WE CAN COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. SELENA PRIOR SEIU IN SUPPORT OF THE CAL FRESH BENEFIT INCREASE THANK YOU THANK YOU. SPEAKER PLACE.

COME. IS THERE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THE LA SHOW. OTTO WAS CARMEN OF FINANCE I THINK WE WOULD NOTE WITH RESPECT TO THE STATE FUNDED CAL FRESH BENEFIT THAT OUT OF YOUR GEN ENCODES A NUMBER OF COST BUT DOESN'T INCLUDE ONE FOR THAT SUPPLEMENTAL BENEFIT WE WOULD SAY THAT PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW SUGGESTS. THAT EACH ADDITIONAL DOLLAR PER INDIVIDUAL. PER MONTH WOULD COST ROUGHLY FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION ONGOING PER YEAR. AND ROUGHLY TWENTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING PER YEAR IF IT'S ONE DOLLAR PER MONTH PER HOUSEHOLD. ANY FURTHER COMMENT.

IN KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT COMMUNITY ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ELIMINATING RACIALLY BIASED DISCIPLINE POLICIES AND PRACTICES. THROUGH THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN STUDENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN WORKING WITH SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS TO BETTER SERVE LOW INCOME. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND FOSTER USE. WE ARE NOW WORKING IN CALIFORNIA CITY WHERE FOUR OUT OF FIVE AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE BEING SUSPENDED. THIS IS THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION RATE IN THE STATE.

DENYING OPPORTUNITY TO DELUDE US WHAT THAT TO SPEAK AND WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ANYTHING YOU CAN THAT THE SENATE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN UP MY COMMENT IS VERY BRIEF ACTUALLY. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD SEE THIS AS AN INVESTMENT. AS YOU ALL KNOW IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA A WE ONLY HAVE ONE INTO IT WHEN YOU TO RICK. UNIVERSITY THAT HAS BEEN BUILT INTO RUSSIA MERCED AND YET WE HAVE OVER TWENTY PRISONS. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA SO MUCH OF OUR WORK IS AS TRIED TO STOP AT SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND THIS OF COURSE IS A SAVINGS TO TAXPAYERS. THE WITH ALLOWING BILL THAT'S LIKE SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY AND IN THIS BUDGET ITEM BUT WE THINK IT WOULDN'T KEEP MORE YOUNG PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON. AND GET THE MOB ON SCHOOL AND THE COLLEGES OF THAT WILL BE A ACTUALLY OF THE IT WILL BE IN AND OF THE FROM FOR THE WHOLE THING CALIFORNIA. NOT ONLY PUT THESE TWO AREAS OF THE BUT THE BAY AREA AND THE CENTER AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS SORELY NEEDED. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I DON'T HAVE VERY MANY OPPORTUNITIES IS KIND OF A DIRECT. THEY DON'T HAVE MEANT MANY RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES MANY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND WE BELIEVE ALIKE ALL THE WORK. OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST IT WOULD START WITH THE GRASSROOTS IT WOULD START WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF THEM IT IS A VERY FRUITFUL. AND I THINK NOT ONLY WILL OUR AREAS BE ABLE TO A TO PROFIT FROM THIS LITTLE SAID A CALIFORNIA WILL PROFIT FROM THE SOUL AND WE HOPE THAT THE BUDGET MEMBERS WILL. LOOK AT THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND AS I SAID BEFORE LOOK AT THIS AS AN INVESTMENT I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THE FIRST TIME I CAME TO SACRAMENTO. I WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OLD.

PARTICULAR CRYSTAL MEDINA CENTER ON IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION COLLABORATIVE. I AM A FATHER OF AN ELEVEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD SON. SO I KNOW THAT AT LEAST TO ME AND MY WIFE THERE IS NO GREATER INVESTMENT THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE PAT. DEVELOPMENT OF OUR KIDS SO THIS PROJECT THAT. SIX INVESTMENT YOUNG PEOPLE THAT PICKED NEEDS OUR SUPPORT. A AS THE CHAIR OF THE CENTER VALLEY IMMIGRANT AGGRESSION COLLABORATIVE WILL ALSO RUN MULTIPLE INTERNSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP PROJECTS FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND COLLEGE GRADUATES.

SEEING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS JUST TO ADD MY TWO CENTS IF I CAN. YOU NO LIKE THE FEW WORDS CAME TO MIND AFTER WE'VE HAD SO MANY EXTRA ORDINARY YOUTH COME AND SPEAK TO IT. AND THE FIRST ONE WAS WOKE. AND THE SECOND WAS EMPOWERED.

BECAME THE FIRST ONE IN MY FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE A FAMILY OF SEVEN. NOW WE'RE A FAMILY OF SIX VOTERS WITH MY FATHER HOPEFULLY SOME BECOMING A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES RACER.

CAN REALLY SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF WHAT THIS MEANS BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT I READ A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOURTEEN WEEKS IN MY POSITION. IS THAT THE BICAMERAL A COMMITTEE SAID. CALIFORNIA MAY NOT HAVE BEEN AT THE INCEPTION OF THIS COUNTRY BUT IT WILL CERTAINLY BE THAT FUTURE. AND THE FUTURE IS IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW AND THEY CARRY THE TESTAMENT AND TESTIMONY OF THE FREEDOM RIDERS A FIFTY YEARS AGO. OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE THE CONTINUES TO BE DONE AND THAT WILL BE DONE IN THE FUTURE AND SO WE AS LEGISLATORS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ENSURING.

IT DOESN'T TAKE. YEAH. I HAVE A FIFTEEN. WE WOKE. THANK A DIRECTOR LIKE FOREIGN PRISCILLA RELEASE BOTH FOR OF PILING US THAT. WHO'S GONNA TURN IT OVER TO. MARCY GOOD EVENING. TOUGH ACT TO FOLLOW. I. THINK YOU FOR INCLUDING THEM VERY THOROUGH OVERVIEW OF THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES PROGRAM. I I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE YOU A UP THE ON OF A FEW DEVELOPMENTS. OF ON THE PROGRAMS AND I WILL START WITH DOCTOR LEGAL SERVICES SAID IT WAS GREAT TO SEE A DOCUMENTED YOU'VE COME UP AND SPEAK ABOUT. HER EXPERIENCE SO AS YOU KNOW. THERE'S A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR DOCTOR LEGAL SERVICES AND. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ANNOUNCED THAT SINCE THE INJUNCTION THERE HAD BEEN THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RENEW THEIR THEIR DOCTORS STATUS. I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT SINCE WE PRODUCE THE REPORT. NOW THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR DOC LEGAL SERVICES THAT'S NINE HER THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IN ONE MONTH ALONE. WITH A SIT OVER SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE. DOT OVER SIX THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO RENEW THEIR DHAKA LEGAL SERVICES IN OVER THIRTY THREE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS. WERE ASSISTED WITH A DOCTOR RENEWAL FEES. THE UNACCOMPANIED UNDOCUMENTED MINORS PROGRAM I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE EX BACKS IF IF WE TAKE THE AVERAGE OF THE ARRIVALS TO DATE WE EXPECT ABOUT FORTY FIVE HUNDRED. ARRIVALS OF UNACCOMPANIED MINORS AND INTO CALIFORNIA WE CURRENTLY SERVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WITH THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S ALLOCATED SO THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT UNDER TEN PERCENT. OF THE OF THE ARRIVALS. AND. I WANT TO TURN TO THE IMMIGRATION SERVICES FUNDING PROGRAM WHICH IS IN ITS THIRD YEAR FUNDING AND THIS YEAR HAS SEEN TREMENDOUS ACTIVITY. IN THE FIRST YEAR FUNDING WE FUNDED SIXTY TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT THIS YEAR WE HAVE FUNDED NINETY TWO ORGANIZATIONS. AND THE FUNDING HAS INCREASED OVER THE LIFE OF THE PROGRAM FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS YEAR ALONE THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROGRAM ELEMENTS ONE OF THEM IS REMOVAL THE FUNDS FUNDING OUT OF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ROUGHLY THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF THE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO REMOVAL DEFENSE. INCLUDING A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S A SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF THE PUBLIC DEFENDER THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MORE ADEQUATELY ADVICE IMMIGRANTS OF. OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF OF ANY CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST THEM. THERE'S A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT SERVICES FOR DEPORTED VETERANS AND YOU MAY YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE THAT THE GOVERNOR JUST RECENTLY PARDONED A NUMBER OF OF OF THAT EVENTS IN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME VETERANS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY. BEEN ABLE TO RETURN TO THE STATE AND SO WE'RE VERY. FORTUNATE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ROLL OUT THAT ELEMENT OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL. AND. BEFORE THE FIRST TIME ALSO FUNDING POST CONVICTION RELIEF SERVICES. TWO THREE ORGANIZATIONS ONE AN ORANGE COUNTY ONE IN THE BAY AREA THIS ISN'T A VERY AND DEVELOPED AREA. OF PRACTICE AND ONE WHERE WE HOPE TO SEE MORE CAPACITY DEVELOPED AND FINALLY AS A AS A NOTED EARLIER. WHEN. ONE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THE END OF THE TPS PROGRAM UP THERE WAS A VERY SHORT WINDOW OF TIME FOR RE REGISTRATION FOR. TPS HOLDERS FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR THERE ARE ROUGHLY FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WITH TPS. FROM OUTSIDE THE DOOR IN CALIFORNIA WITH ROUGHLY FIFTY THOUSAND US CITIZEN CHILDREN AND SO. OF WE WERE. ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO SPECIALIZE IN THIS AS IN THIS AREA TO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT POPULATION COULD BE SERVED. AND THEN OF FINALLY IN TERMS OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. THIS YEAR. WE. CHEMICALLY WAIT MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW CAL FRESH'S EFFORTS ROUNDS AROUND DISASTER RELIEF OUT WE WERE ABLE TO COORDINATE. AND A VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE COORDINATION WITH WITH CAL FRESH WERE TO BE IN ORDER TO REACH OUT TO IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS. AND ALSO. DEVELOPED A STANDALONE PROGRAM FOR RULED OUT A STANDALONE PROGRAM FOR DISASTER RELIEF SERVICES FOR FOR IT FOR IMMIGRANTS AFFECTED BY THE WILD WILD FIRES AND CINNAMON OUT BUT IN OTHER AREAS OF NORTHERN. CALIFORNIA. ALL BALK ALL CONCLUDE BY BY BY SHARING SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PROGRAM SO. I THINK THAT THE HEADLINES OF THE LAST WEEK ALONE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE MAIN CHALLENGES OF THE PROGRAM THERE'S A. PRONOUNCEMENT ON FEDERAL LAW AND POLICY IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY DAY SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY. AND THAT CREATES A STRAIN ON THE ON THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE ON THE GROUND AND TRIED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OF THE OF THE. THAT THE NEW POLICY PRONOUNCEMENTS CREATE. AND ALSO. IT ALSO GENERATES I'VE ALONG LIST OF PRIORITIES AND IT BECOMES REALLY DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE AMONGST THOSE PRIORITIES WHETHER IT'S TPS HOLDERS OR DHAKA OR ASYLUM SEEKERS OR CHILDREN OR THE API COMMUNITY. THEY'RE ALL EXTRAORDINARILY COMPELLING DEMANDS AND THERE'S THERE'S A LOT MORE NEED. THAN CAN CURRENTLY BE MATT EITHER WITH THE FUNDING LEVELS OR FRANKLY WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AVAILABLE AND I THINK THE. THE THE PROGRAM RUNS INTO THE SAME CONCERNS THAT ANY PROGRAM THAT THE MINISTER THROUGH A CBO INFRASTRUCTURE RUNS INTO THAT THERE ARE LONG STANDING LEGACY ISSUES AROUND. AROUND CAPACITY IN MANY AREAS OF THE PARTICULARLY INLAND CALIFORNIA LAKE THE NORTH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE CENTRAL VALLEY SURPRISINGLY AND I MENTIONED THIS LAST YEAR THE CENTRAL COAST AND ALSO THAT. THE INLAND EMPIRE SO THE DEPARTMENT HOUSE. WHERE POSSIBLE WORKED VERY CLOSELY AND TRY TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND CAPACITY IN REGIONS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED AND ALSO FOR POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNDERSERVED LIKE THE API POPULATION? AND SO I WILL I WILL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE. NEXT WITHIN A FULL. GOOD EVENING I'M I HAVE TO SAY IT'S IT'S PRETTY AMAZING TO SIT HERE THIRTY YEARS LATER AND SEE THE ROBUST INVESTMENT AND WORK THAT IS HAPPENING UNDER THE PROGRAM. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR HONORING HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE FUNDING THE PROGRAM AT FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO WORK. WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND CREATING IMPLEMENTING THIS HYBRID MODEL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS ARE STATE AGAINST DEVASTATING DEPORTATIONS AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED THE PROGRAM HAS RESPONDED TO A NUMBER OF CHANGING IMMIGRATION POLICIES SINCE ITS INCEPTION. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE PROGRAM MAINTAIN ITS LEVEL FUNDING TO ALLOW FOR IT TO RESPOND TO THE GROWING ATTACKS ON IMMIGRANTS. CONTRACTORS ARE FIGHTING EVERY DAY TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES TO REPRESENTATION FOR IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND EVERYDAY THAT FIGHT INTENSIFIES ATTACKS ANDHAKA ATTACKS ON DP TPS. ATTACKS ON DUE PROCESS IN IMMIGRATION COURT JUST THIS PAST WEEK THE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED. THEIR INTENTION TO ESTABLISH QUOTAS FOR IMMIGRATION JUDGES SO THAT THEY CAN MOVE OUR CASES MORE QUICKLY. YOU KNOW AND WE CLIENTS WOULD PAY THE PRICE OF DUE PROCESS THROUGH THAT. AND SO YOU KNOW THIS LEVEL INVESTMENT AS. CHAIRED WILL NOT REACH ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS IN NEED OF IMMIGRATION SERVICES AND THERE ARE EXISTING ELIGIBILITY RULES THAT LIMIT THE UNIVERSALITY OF LEGAL REPRESENTATION. BUT IT WAS A CRITICAL AND POWERFUL STEP FOR A STATE TO CONNECT CALIFORNIANS TO RELIEF FROM DEPORTATION WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT WHILE WE ALSO LEARNED ABOUT THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOMES OF THIS YEAR'S. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INVESTMENT AND ALSO ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE SITE VISITS INCLUDING HOW WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT UNDOCUMENTED ASIAN POPULATION. HOW WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO DEPORTATION AND THE CAPACITY? ISSUES THAT DEPARTMENT HAS RELATED WITH REGARD TO VARIOUS REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT NEED SUPPORT THAT NEED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARE MAKING EFFORTS. TO GET THERE BY QUITE FRANKLY THE NEED TO SO SIGNIFICANT SO WE KNOW THAT HE PETITIONS WREAK HAVOC ON OUR COMMUNITIES IN OUR STATE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND THE REALLY THOUGHTFUL EFFORTS.

I'M ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THOUGH IS IN LIGHT OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION THAT SEEMS AS IF THEY'RE CHANGING POLICIES. ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE HOW RESPONSIVE IS THE ONE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO MEET THE CHANGING DEMAND. AND MORE EXPLICITLY I'M REALLY LOOKING AT THE I NINE AUDITS THAT. HAPPENED IN MY BACKYARD. AND THE FACT THAT WE REACHED CAPACITY WITHIN ONE MONTH FOR OUR ABILITY TO. HELP TO PROVIDE DEFENSE AND AM WONDERING IF THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE MAY HAVE. TO HELP MEET THIS INCREASING. NEED. WITH THAT THE EXISTING. FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE ON IT EXISTING STATUTORY STRUCTURE. I BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS MADE EVERY EFFORT TO BE AS RESPONSIVE AS AS POSSIBLE WITH THAT WITH THE PROGRAM. TO MEET THE NEEDS AND. WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT THROUGH. VERY CLOSE COORDINATION AND COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH WITH THAT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE GROUND IN EVERY YEAR WITH A NEW ROUND OF FUNDING WE TRY TO TAKE A STEP BACK TO LOOK AT WHERE THE GAPS IN SERVICES. ARE BUT THERE ARE REALLY LEGITIMATE ISSUES AROUND PRIORITIZING. VERY COMPELLING. CASES WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW FUNDING FOR DETAINED INDIVIDUALS OR OR OR OR FUNDING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WHO THE IMMIGRATION COURTS AS THEY CAN DEFEND THEMSELVES OR. OR OR FUNDING FOR TPS HOLDERS ARE ASYLUM SEEKERS. THERE ARE REAL CHALLENGING. DECISIONS TO BE MADE ABOUT WHERE PRIORITY SHOULD SHOULD BE. I WOULD SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT ALSO TRIES TO COORDINATE CLOSELY WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO STAY WITH THEN. THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE SO EVEN WHEN THEY'RE AT THERE IS A NEED IN THE COMMUNITY YOU MAY HAVE A SERVICE PROVIDER THAT SPECIALIZES IN DHAKA FOR EXAMPLE OR NATURALIZATION SERVICES. AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT HE SAYS THEY'RE IT IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT. PROGRAM AREA AND SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO TO SHIFT PRIORITIES AND AND. WE WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE UNWORKABLE TO MAKE THOSE AMOUNTS OF THEM. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT AND SAY THAT THEIR. ARE STRONG EXISTING STATE PROTECTIONS AROUND THE WAYS THAT EMPLOYERS SOMETIMES TARGET THEIR IMMIGRANT WORKERS AND A REALLY HIGH LATE THAT. IT YOU KNOW PART OF THAT I THINK IS MAKING SURE THE ENFORCEMENT IS AVAILABLE AND PREPARED TO RESPOND ESPECIALLY AT A LOCAL LEVEL WITH REGARDS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IN HER STYLE. I GUESS THE CONCERN AND WHY I BROUGHT IT UP AS WE WENT FROM THIRTY MILLION TO FORTY FIVE MILLION AND YET WE WERE TOLD THE CAPACITY OF OUR LOCAL REGION. WAS SET FROM THE YEAR PRIOR THAT IT HAD NOT CHANGED WITH THE INCREASE IN FUNDING. I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT IT LINEARLY INCREASED AS FUNDING INCREASED BUT THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO BE THE CASE AND SO. I'M JUST TRYING TO REALLY DO AGAIN AS TIMES CHANGE. WHAT WE FUND NEEDS TO ALSO BE REFLECTIVE OF WHAT OUR CURRENT CHALLENGES ARE INTO JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT FORWARD? I THINK THAT THE BUILDING CAPACITY IS BOTH A FUNCTION OF OF FUNDING AND TIME. IT TAKES ORGANIZATIONS TIME TO BE ABLE TO. HIGHER STOCK. DEVELOP THE ADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR SOMETIME VERY COMPLEX CASES ON. AND. DEVELOPING THE SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE FOR A LEGAL PRACTICE. THAT IS THAT IT'S THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. ORGANIZATIONS CAN THAT HAPPEN HOW THE PRIOR EXPERIENCE CAN PIVOT TO AND SOMETIMES EVEN EVEN A YEAR. SO. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE CAN SAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A PERFECT CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN INCREASE IN FUNDING AND INCREASED ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. THERE ARE AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I BELIEVE LIKE LONGSTANDING DEEP. HAVE LEGACY ISSUES AROUND FUNDINGS FORCED A CBO INFRASTRUCTURE AND UNDERSERVED AREAS AND SO WHERE POSSIBLE THE DEPARTMENT HAS TRIED TO WORK WITH OTHER PARTNERS. WHO CAN FOCUS ON HELPING THOSE ORGANIZATIONS BUILD? ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY SO THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO DELIVER ON SERVICES THAT CAN BE VERY COMPLEX AND VERY DEMANDING THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND MEET THE CRITERIA THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FUNDING. AND THERE'S ALSO ALL THE THINGS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTER. STATE FUNDING AND ITSELF REQUIRES A CERTAIN LEVEL OF OF EXPERTISE WERE FOR FOR CBO AN EXPERIENCE. WHO AM I THINK WE'LL HEAR ABOUT THIS IN THE NEXT ITEM BUT REALLY WANTED TO? BRING UP SIMILAR TO IN MEDICINE THERE ARE CERTAIN PART OF OUR STATE WHERE WE LACK THE APPROPRIATE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEAL WITH OUR CURRENT CHALLENGES. AND. ARE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH HOW WE BUILD THAT CAPACITY LONG TERM AND. I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT NEXT PROPOSAL AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO. SEE A COMPLIMENTARY PACKAGE TO WHAT IS INCLUDED HERE WITHIN ONE CALIFORNIA. SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVENTY GOOD AFTERNOON WITH THE GOODNESS OF MY* ON THE CHAIR OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY DIFFERENT PERSON COLLABORATIVE. AND I'M ALSO HERE STEERING COMMITTEE MEMBER OF THE FRESNO COUNTY LEGAL DEFENSE FUND. I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO. SPEAK HERE AT THIS HEARING ON BEHALF OF THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THE TODAY. MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE TODAY. AND THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP SACRAMENTO. HAVE PRESENTED TO YOU AND TO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE A FOUR POINT PROPOSAL BUT IS A CALL FOR HELP. YES LIVE MAY BE CLEAR FROM THE START WE NEED YOUR HELP. IN PARTICULAR WE NEED YOUR HELP TO ADDRESS TWO PROBLEMS ONE THE HISTORICAL NEGLECT OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TO THE THREATS THAT OPPOSED TO THIS IMMIGRANT FAMILIES BY THE INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS OF IMMIGRATION ACOSTA CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT. BETTER NOTIFIES. AND WHICH ARE CURRENTLY TAKING PLACE IN THE REGION. AS THE RESULT OF THESE PARALLEL PROPHECIES. WE ARE WITNESSING THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHAT CAN BEST BE DESCRIBED AS A CRISIS SITUATION. IT IS A CRISIS SITUATION BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING ONE. WE HAVE A SIZEABLE IMMIGRANT POPULATION THE TOTALS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. PEOPLE IN THE REGION. THAT IS ENCOMPASSED BY STANISLAUS CONCURRENT COUNTIES. IT IS THE REGION WHERE THEY'RE ABOUT HALF A MILLION CHILDREN WITH AT LEAST ONE IMMIGRANT PARENTS. IT IS A CRISIS OF A FUTURE IT IS A SITUATION ARE BUT CAN BE THE SCRIBE IS A CRISIS SITUATION BECAUSE. I THE PENSIONS HAVE DOUBLED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN COMPARISON TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. ALSO BECAUSE THE PENSIONS IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHERE THE HIGHEST OF ANY MONTHS IN MANY YEARS. ALSO BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE TRAINEES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL. AND ARE EASY TARGETS FOR THE PETITION AND THE ENSUING BREAKUP OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. IT IS A CRISIS SITUATION ALSO BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE REGION. DO NOT HAVE ATTORNEYS SPECIALIZING REMOVAL DEFENSE. ALSO IT IS A SITUATION WHICH MOST OF THE OF THESE NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS DO NOT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR REMOVAL DEFENSE. THE RECENTLY RELEASED DIRECTORY OF AGENCIES CONTRACTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. LIST SIXTY TO CONTRACTED TO. OUT OF SIXTY TWO. ARE BASED IN THE. CENTRAL VALLEY. ONE BASED IN SACRAMENTO ONE AT BAKERSFIELD. THE FRESNO COUNTY LEGAL DEFENSE FUND IS A COMMUNITY DRIVEN EFFORT THAT HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER. LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS CONCERNED WITH THE INADEQUATE LEGAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXIST IN THE REGION. TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES BE BROKEN UP BY ICE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMMORAL ANY RATIONAL. TO REMAIN PASSIVE WHILE IMMIGRANTS ARE DENIED DUE PROCESS. THEREBY DISRUPTING FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY STABILITY. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN IMPORTANT STEPS TO ASSIST AND PROTECT IMMIGRANTS. WE WISH TO EXPAND THESE PROTECTIONS AND BENEFITS TO IMMIGRANTS RECITING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. A REGION THAT OVER THE YEAR. OVER THE YEARS HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO NEGLECT AND RECEIVED INADEQUATE INVESTMENT FROM FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS THAT CALL FOR HELP. BUT ALSO A DOCUMENT WITH IDEAS AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS TO BE ONGOING NEGLECT OF THE INTEREST RIGHTS AND CONCERNS OF IMMIGRANTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT IS AN INITIAL EFFORT ON OUR PART. THAT REQUIRES YOUR LEGISLATIVE SUPPORT AND THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF YOUR STAFF TO MAKE IT ACTIONABLE. WE'RE PROPOSING ONE. SUPPORT FOR THE PARTITION DEFENSE FUND THEY WILL PROVIDE REMOVAL DEFENSE TO ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED IMMIGRANTS. THE ASSISTANCE WILL BE PROVIDED THREE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. WITH BE A A CREDIT THE REPRESENTATIVES OR. AND ALSO MAY HAVE ATTORNEYS AND ALSO REPUTABLE PRIVATE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS. THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT OF PROVIDING NONPROFIT AGENCIES EXPERIENCE THE REMOVAL DEFENSE. AND CONTRIBUTE TO OVERALL REGIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING. TO. A RURAL JUSTICE FELLOWS PROGRAM. THAT WOULD RECRUIT TRAIN AND DEPLOY A COHORT OF RECENT LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES. THE FELLOWS WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO NONPROFIT LEGAL SERVICES AGENCIES IN THE REGION. AND BE SUPERVISED BY COORDINATING ATTORNEY. A SIMILAR AND VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM HAS BEEN CREATED NEW YORK AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONDITIONS SUCCESS TO ESTABLISH ONE. ESTABLISHED ONE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND THEREBY BRING ABOUT A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT INTO LEGAL CAPACITY IN OUR REGION. THREE. A COLLEGE TO LAW SCHOOL PIPELINE PROJECT. THE PROJECT WOULD RECRUIT A COHORT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE. AND ARE INTERESTED IN ATTENDING LAW SCHOOL. THEY WILL BE PLACED WITH NONPROFIT AGENCIES FOR TWO YEAR PERIOD TRAINED TO OBTAIN BE A ACCREDITATION AND ASSIST IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. THERE WILL BE PROVIDED WITH SUPPORT TO STUDY FOR THE LSAT ABBY SUPERVISED BY COORDINATING ATTORNEY. AND FOR. THE CREATION OF A SAMPLE CAN RALLY IMMIGRATION CAREER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE SIGN TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS. BY OFFERING A LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. SIMILAR TO THAT OFFERED IN SOME LOCATIONS TO ATTRACT DOCTORS. THIS PROJECT WOULD HELP ATTRACT AND RETAIN IMMIGRATION ATTORNEYS IN A REGION. THAT REQUIRES THE PRESENCE AND THEIR SERVICES. HELP US FARM SOLUTIONS TO THE CRISIS. SITUATION THAT WE'RE FACING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. HELP US BUILD THE LEGAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY. SERVED ON NINE A THOUSAND IMMIGRANTS AND HALF A MILLION CHILDREN. WITH AN IMMIGRANT PARENT. HELP US MAKE TO PROCESS THAT REALITY FOR IMMIGRANTS WERE NOW BEING DETAINED AND DEPORTED WITHOUT ACCESS TO COUNSEL. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON OF LITTLE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE OUT CHAIR SOMETHING MEMORABLE THING THAT I'M WE'RE NOT. STATE OFFICIALS ON WILL GET A COMMUNITY MEMBERS MY NAME IS HAVE IT ALASKA SOME THE DIRECTOR OF WINTERS AND SERVICES FOR THE EDUCATIONAL FOUNDATION. I'M FRESNO CALIFORNIA ALSO THAT THE RECIPIENT.

WE HAVE REPRESENTING ASSISTED OVER ONE THOUSAND LEGAL PRIMER RESIDENTS WITH NATURALIZATION PROCESS THROTTLE SINCE IT DOES A FIFTEEN. FINALLY FROM MY CALIFORNIA HAS TRICKLE. TO THIS FAMILIES MANY OF THEM ARE HERE. TO THEIR WE HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF MANY UNDOCUMENTED MIX THAT IS FAMILIES LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE LACK OF TRAINING GREATER RIPS ITEMS LACK OF TRUST ENTRANCE. THE REASON. ROSSER PUBLISHED BY THE FINAL JUSTICE TO THEY SINGLEREPORTED THAT THERE ARE CLEARLY. NINE HUNDRED TWELVE REDNECKS ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE US. IN THE VALLEY ITSELF HOWEVER THEY'RE ONLY LEVEL RECKLESS ORGANIZATIONS PRIMARILY BECAUSE TRAIN THE FRESNO COUNTY. THESE ARE SOME OF THESE AGENCIES HAVE OXYGEN OFFICER RURAL AREAS BUT SIR IMMIGRANTS IN A MINIMAL CAPACITY. SO MAJOR SEES PLAYED ONE OF REPRESENTED A TROUBLE TWICE A MONTH WITH FOUR REPRESENT US ALL OVER ALL OVER THE A CAMPUS BURBANK HOSTAGE THE FAMILIES. SOME OF THESE FAMILIES TROUBLE TWO TO THREE HOURS TO GET IMMIGRATION ASSISTANCE SOME OF THESE FAMILIES MAY HAVE TO LOSE A DAY OUT OF THE WAR. TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VALLEY LACKS LEGAL CAPACITY TO COVER THIS BIG GRAPHICAL AREA. SHE'S INDIAN OF THE YEAR WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA THE RECENT WEEKS ON THEIR WAY TO WORK. TO IMMIGRANT PARENTS ON THE LAND. PLUS OUR LIVES WHILE SKIPPING UP FROM. ICE AGENTS TO TO FEAR LIVING SIX ORPHAN AND HOMELESS CHILDREN. THE FUNERALS WERE JUST TWO DAYS AGO. EARLY FAVORING AT LEAST FORTY WORKERS FROM BC TEACHERS SINFUL AND FATHER CALIFORNIA. LAZAR JOBS AFTER FAILED FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AGENTS BEGAN I NINE OUT ITS BY CHECKING EMPLOYEE RECORDS. SEARCHING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED TO WORK IN THE UNITED STATES AND STONE PANIC. THAT RESONATED THROUGHOUT THE BALLOT. OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE MADE WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ADVOCATING FOR MORE RESOURCE TO THE VALLEY. WE NEED YOUR WITH DESPERATE HELP TO WREAK MEDIA THE PETITION THE OF THE FANS RESOURCES TO THE VALLEY. WE NEED STRONG LEGAL STRUCTURE AND CAPACITY BILLION TO THE EXISTING COMMITMENT TO EXISTING. PRERACE TRANSITION THAT WE HAVE BEGUN WITH WITH ALVIN AND CIVIC ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD THE CAPACITY TO PROVIDE. TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES TO STOP A COUPLE OF THINGS A COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE SO THAT. MANY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE A NUMBER OF SUBCONTRACTORS THAT DON'T APPEAR ON THE LIST SO THAT THAT LIST IS IS. DOESN'T IDENTIFY ALL THE SERVICE PROVIDERS IN MANY OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS WHO ARE SUBCONTRACTORS TO PRIMARY OUR SUBCONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY DON'T YET MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR. THE STATUTORY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WHICH IS ONE FACTOR THAT HAS. PREVENTED SOME ORGANIZATIONS FROM FROM. FROM OF RECEIVING A FUNDING DIRECTLY FROM THAT FROM THE DEPARTMENT BUT IN ALL INSTANCES WHEN THE DEPARTMENT IS REVIEWING. APPLICATIONS THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE'RE VERY MINDFUL OF THE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THEIR. WHERE WHERE THERE ARE LIMITED SERVICES AND AND REALLY TRY TO PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS FOR FUNDING? THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A.

IT THE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE NOT GOING BASED OFFICES STATISTICS NOT GOING BASED OFF WHAT YOU HEAR IN THE MEDIA AND ONGOING BASED OFF ANYTHING ELSE IT'S FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE. THAT THIS IS WHAT WE NEED. WE'RE TRYING TO DO THINGS THE RIGHT WAY. SO THIS JUST IS A BIG STEP TOWARDS THOUGHT. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY THINK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS I AM A MARTINEZ LOT I WORK WITH A FAITH IN THE VALLEY. AND. I WAS ABLE TO. SPEAK TO INDIVIDUALS. THAT HAD BEEN AFFECTED BY SOMEONE BEING DETAINED IN THEIR HOME. EVERYTHING FROM AN EIGHT MONTH OLD AND SHE WAS PREGNANT EIGHT MONTHS. SHE HAD A GUN POINTED TO HER FACE. ATTIRE OF THE FATHER OF A CHILD WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. A INDIVIDUAL WITH DHAKA WHO WAS PROMISED TO BE PROTECTED. CALLISON A. ARE NOW IN DETENTION. LEAVING THE FAMILY TO COME UP WITH FOUR TO SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS CSH FOR BOND. IT'S NOT FOR LEGAL DEFENSE THAT'S TO COME UP WITH BOND TO RELEASE THE INDIVIDUALS. SO NOW THEY ARE FACED WITH HOW DO WE COME UP WITH THE MONEY FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION. I WON'T TELL YOU GUYS THE STORIES OF EVERY SINGLE ONE INDIVIDUAL THAT IS NOW STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO. FIGHT THEIR LOVED ONES CASE BECAUSE REALLY IF THEY WERE HERE THE LINE REALLY WOULD GO OUT THE DOOR. THAT'S HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS I'VE TALKED TO FIRSTHAND THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. SO WHEREIN CRISIS MODE RIGHT NOW. BUT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE. DO THIS LONG TERM. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY TAKING CARE OF OUR FAMILIES WERE TAKING CARE OF THE GENERATIONS TO COME. SO THINK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'M IN A BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS AND. I WAS REMEMBERING A STORY WHEN THE FATHER WAS SPEAKING. ACTUALLY REMINDED ME OF MY FATHER WHO IS WATCHING MY KIDS AT THE TIME AND WHEN I CAME HOME HE WAS. SHARING WITH THEM AND RECOUNTING WHAT HAPPENED IN DILLON. AND IN I WAS BORN IN THAT CITY MY. FATHER WAS A LAWYER FOR CRLA IN THAT CITY FIGHTING FOR. IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS A GENERATION AGO. AND. YOUR PROPOSAL HERE TODAY WILL HELP US TO DEAL WITH MUCH OF THE FEAR THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS FACING. AND I AM PROUD OF YOUR ABILITY TO COME AND BRING A VOICE TO IT. AND THAT. WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN FOR NOW BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU AS THIS PROGRESSES. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE A TICKET WE'RE GOING TO START WITH BENITO JANE IF THAT'S OKAY AND THEN CRISTINA MANSFIELD. GREAT THANK YOU AND SO YES MY NAME'S BENITO JAN I'M WITH THE IMMIGRANT FAMILY DEFENSE FUND. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. WE LAUNCHED A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO TO SUPPORT OAKLAND AND NOW ALL OF ALAMEDA COUNTY. FAMILIES THAT ON IMMIGRATION CRISIS AND SPECIFICALLY I HAVE FAMILIES WHO HAD A LOVED ONE WHO IS IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION. AND TODAY WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA HAS REQUEST FOR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET APPROPRIATION FOR AN IMMIGRATION BOND FUNDS. THIS BOND FUND WOULD OFFER RECOVERABLE GRANTS TO NONPROFITS TO ENABLE THEM TO POST IMMIGRATION BOND FOR CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE. AYE WHO ARE DETAINED IN ICE FACILITIES WERE DETAINED IMMIGRATION AT AN IMMIGRATION DETENTION IN CALIFORNIA. QUITE ABLE TO GET OUT BECAUSE I THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE BOND AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN SET BY ICE OR HAVE BEEN SET BY AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE YOU JUST HEARD JUST TWO MINUTES AGO THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE SEEING. BOND AMOUNTS THAT ARE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE AND PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN. PAYING THIS IF SURPLUS SOMEHOW FINDING MONEY AND TO GET THEIR LOVED ONE OUT OF DETENTION OR HIGHER IMMIGRATION LAWYER OR PAY THEIR RENT OR SOME BECAUSE YOU KNOW ANY COMPETITION CAN IMAGINE. IN OUR CASE OLIVER FAMILIES HAVE SCHOOL AGE KIDS AND ALAMEDA COUNTY MOST AND THERE WERE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW MOSTLY PEOPLE FROM MICK STATUS FAMILIES MEANING PEOPLE. UP WHO HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO MIGHT BE LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS OR CITIZENS UNDOCUMENTED A COMBINATION. FORTY TWO PERCENT HAVE U. S. CITIZEN KIDS WERE TALKING ABOUT LAWFUL PERMANENT RESIDENTS WERE FACING DEPORTATION VETERANS UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THAT OF ARE ELIGIBLE FOR SOME KIND OF STATUS HERE. PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION APPLYING FOR ASYLUM WHILE WE'RE FACING DETENTION FROM OUR ON SITE FACING DEPORTATION FROM BEHIND BARS. AND YOU KNOW GETTING BOND SUPPORT BUT WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR FAMILIES AND OTHERS. IS GETTING BOND SUPPORT HAS BEEN CRITICAL TO PUTTING PEOPLE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO FIGHT. THEIR CASES FROM FREEDOM SO I HAVE NO I'M JUST THINKING OF OUR FAMILIES WILL WORK WITH RECENTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. A DAD WHO'S BEEN ABLE TO BE PRESENT FOR HIS DOCUMENTED DAUGHTER'S WEDDING A DAD WHO WAS ABLE TO REUNITE WITH HIS KIDS AFTER MONTHS OF BEING SEPARATED. OTHER WAS ASSEMBLING UP IN OAKLAND STUDENTS WHO WAS BASICALLY A FATHER FIGURE IN HIS HOUSEHOLD BEING ABLE TO BE RELEASED AND. AND. HOPING HIS MOM NOW TAKE CARE OF HIS YOUNGER SIBLINGS GOTTEN. YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN HERE ALL DAY SO WE KNOW WHEN I HAD TO THE EVENING. TOO MUCH BUT JUST TO SAY THAT THE ABILITY TO FIGHT DEPORTATION FROM FREEDOM MAKES SUCH A BIG DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO WHEN. PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE COUNSEL IF YOU'RE IN DETENTION IT'S HARDER TO WIN YOUR CASE. THERE WAS A STUDY THAT STANFORD DEAD A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WHERE IT LOOKED AT OUT DEPORTATION CASES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE DETAINED AND HAVE COUNSEL THIRTY THREE PERCENT ARE AYE AND OF WINNING THEIR DEPORTATION CASES. PEOPLE WHO WERE DETAINED THEN WERE RELEASED TO HAVE COUNSEL. I EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WONDER HE SAYS YOU KNOW THIRTY THREE PERCENT EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT IT'S SUCH. A BIG DIFFERENCE. SO YOU KNOW I GUESS JUST TO WRAP BROUGHT IT UP TO CRISTINA CAN ALSO TALK. I THINK THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AS BUDGET REQUEST HERE IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY. AGAIN SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE DETAINED IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR. AND WE EXPECT THESE NUMBERS TO SPIKE GIVEN THE. DRASTIC INCREASE AND PEOPLE WERE BEING DETAINED BY ICE AND GIVEN. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REQUEST FOR INCREASED MONEY FOR DETENTION POT. INSTANT THAT WERE HOPING YOU'LL CONSIDER AND BE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND GOOD EVENING ESTEEMED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'M CRISTINA MANSFIELD ON THE CO FOUNDER AND CO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FREEDOM FOR IMMIGRANTS. FORMERLY KNOWN AS CIVIC WHERE NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO ENDING ARE PROFIT DRIVEN IMMIGRATION DETENTION SYSTEM. WHILE ALLEVIATING THE SUFFERING OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY SUFFERING IN THE SYSTEM AND WE DO THIS THROUGH A VISITATION INDEPENDENT MONITORING STORYTELLING AND ADVOCACY. WE'VE BEEN RUNNING A REVOLVING IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND BOND FUNDS SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WHICH ALLOWS US TO FREE PEOPLE FROM IMMIGRATION DETENTION AND REUNITE THEM WITH THEIR FAMILIES WHILE THEY SEEK LEGAL RELIEF IN THEIR IMMIGRATION CASES. IN TOTAL WE'VE REYES CLOSE TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO FREE TWENTY NINE PEOPLE FROM IMMIGRATION DETENTION. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ALL OF THE LOVED ONES OF THESE PEOPLE THE EFFECT OF PAYING IMMIGRATION BOND IS EXPONENTIAL AND PROTECTING. OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES FROM UNNECESSARY HARM. UP ALL OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE HELPED TO TO RELEASE ARE PEOPLE WHO AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE HAS DECIDED ARE NEITHER DANGER. NOR A FLIGHT RISK. AND ALL THE PEOPLE WE'VE HELPED TO RELEASED FROM DETENTION WOULD HAVE. REMAINS IN PRISON FOR MONTHS OR YEARS. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR. THIS GOES AGAINST OUR VALUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SINCE DONALD TRUMP WAS ELECTED THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ROLLED BACK MANY THE STEVE SAFEGUARDS PROTECTIONS AND AVENUES FOR RELEASE OF PEOPLE IN DETENTION. AS A RESULTS AND PEOPLE ARE EITHER LANGUISHING IN PRISON FOR YEARS OR OTHER FOR FORCED TO WORK WITH EXTREMELY EXPLOITIVE COMPANIES LIKELY BREAK BY THE ACCESS. WHICH CHARGE. UNBELIEVABLE RATES FOR THEIR SERVICES OF ACTING AS. BAIL BONDSMAN IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION SPACE. SO NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE POLITICAL AISLE YOU SIT ON WE CAN PROBABLY ALL AGREE THAT THE SYSTEM IS A OWES A WASTE OF OUR FEDERAL TAXPAYER DOLLARS. OUR SPENDING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS A DAY TO IMPRISON PEOPLE IN DETENTION. M. ALTERNATIVES COST A FRACTION OF THIS IN APPROVED HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE COMPLY WITH THEIR PROCEEDINGS. SO BY SPONSORING A STATE FUNDED. REVOLVING IMMIGRATION BOND FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE LEADING THE WAY AND DEMONSTRATING THAT IMMIGRATION DETENTION ISN'T NECESSARY TO INSURE COMPLIANCE WITH ANNA IMMIGRATION LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. AND PROVIDING A MODEL AND DATA FOR HOW WE CAN CREATIVELY REFORM THE SYSTEM FEDERALLY. I THINK GIL. WORKLIGHT BORN MERCIFUL RELEASE AND COME TO. HERE TO THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISSUE AND AS A MATTER OF FACT. IS PART OF THE FUNDING CYCLE THIS YEAR A PRIORITIZE BOND HEARINGS BY MAKING IT A STANDALONE SERVICE THAT COULD BE. COULD BE OFFERED IN RECOGNITION OF THE MUCH IMPROVED OUTCOMES THAT IMMIGRANTS FACE IF THEY ARE RELEASED RELEASED FROM BOND AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING FOR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA A. PAINTINGS OF STILL REVIEWING THE PROPOSAL LOOKS FORWARD TO REVIEWING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THANK YOU ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHTEEN. GOOD EVENING AGAIN I'M SALLY CAN NATIONAL FROM THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER. AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BOND BUDGET REQUEST AS WRITTEN AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN ALL TOO FREQUENTLY MOTHERS FATHERS SIT AND SIBLINGS REMAIN DETAINED FOR MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS AS THEY. FIGHTER DEPORTATION CASE BEHIND BARS UP BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO POST BOND. THIS TAKES A SEVERE MENTAL TOLL AND MANY PEOPLE EVEN GIVE UP MERITORIOUS CASES SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO REMAIN INCARCERATED AND SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES. IMPORTANTLY PEOPLE ONLY RECEIVED BOND AFTER ICE OR AN IMMIGRATION JUDGE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE INDIVIDUAL SHOULD AND CAN BE RELEASED AND THERE AND AT THAT POINT THERE ONLY PENDING PAYMENT OF THE BOND TO BE RELEASED FROM DETENTION. AS THIS BUDGET REQUEST PROCEEDS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT OUR REMAINS AS INCLUSIVE AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS DICTATING WHO IS DESERVING AND WHO HAS NOT. OUR BELIEF IS THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A CHANCE TO BE BONDED OUT OF DETENTION. THE GAME. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AND WANTED TO THANK THE ADVOCATES AS WELL AS A SOMEONE BONTA FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE IT IS QUITE TIME. I WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHTEEN OPEN FOR NOW AND CONCLUDE TODAY SOMEONE HERE THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING OKAY
