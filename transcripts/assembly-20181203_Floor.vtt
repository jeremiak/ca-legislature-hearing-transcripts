01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:52.621
DEBT.

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.222
WHEN THEY ELECTED AS LAST MONTH?

AS A WAS ABOUT THE GAS TAX.

01:20:03.832 --> 01:20:06.001
WE HAVE TAKEN MAJOR STEPS TO

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.669
CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.371

FOR THE FUTURE.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:25.787
BOTH GOOD.

01:20:25.854 --> 01:20:28.156
AND BAD.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.024
WE HAVE INVESTED IN EARLY

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:31.560
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION K. THROUGH

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.195
TWELVE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES

01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:34.296
THAT'S BUILDING FOR A STRONGER

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.864
FUTURE.

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:37.499
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE SET

01:20:37.566 --> 01:20:39.467
ASIDE RECORD RESERVES AS A

01:20:39.534 --> 01:20:41.136
CUSHION AGAINST BAD TIMES AND

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:43.305
MAKE GOVERNMENT MORE ACCOUNTABLE

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.072
FOR WHAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH

01:20:44.139 --> 01:20:46.708
TAXPAYER DOLLARS AS WE PUSH FOR

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.677
WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION.

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.645
AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:52.447
THE THREAD THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.216
OF THESE POLICY VICTORIES IS

01:20:54.282 --> 01:20:56.051
MAKING THINGS BETTER FOR THE

01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.919
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.354
JUST THAT ONE GOAL.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.555
LET'S LEAVE OUR STATE BETTER

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:02.991
THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT.

01:21:03.058 --> 01:21:04.826
OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS I'VE

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:07.128
LEARNED SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:08.296
WORKING ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:10.232
OF CALIFORNIA LEADS TO SUCCESS.

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:12.701
AND THOSE SUCCESSES ARE REWARDED.

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:16.071
BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:21:16.137 --> 01:21:17.939
JUST MAKING THINGS BETTER IS IS

01:21:18.006 --> 01:21:18.974
REALLY.

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.742
WHY ALL OF YOU ARE HERE BOTH YOU

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:21.876
COMMERCE?

01:21:21.943 --> 01:21:24.312
AND THOSE WHO ARE RETURNING.

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:25.614
WE HAVE MADE THINGS BETTER IN

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.349
CALIFORNIA SAID THAT THEY THE

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.084
CALIFORNIA VOTERS SAID THEY

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:31.453
LIKED WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:33.088
I WANT TO LOOK BACK FOR A SECOND.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:34.456
LOOK BACK TO THE SWEARING IN TWO

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:36.625
YEARS AGO.

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:37.225
WHEN THE OUTLOOK WAS SOMEWHAT

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.293
DIFFERENT?

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:39.661
I KNEW THEN THAT WE ARE ENTERING

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:41.529
PERILOUS TERRITORY.

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.398
MY WORST FEARS HAVE NOT YET

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:45.667
MATERIALIZED WE'VE IT OR NOT.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.535
BUT THE FEDERAL REALITY HAS BEEN

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.371
QUITE BAD ENOUGH.

01:21:49.437 --> 01:21:50.972
IN THE LAST MONTH WE HAVE THE

01:21:51.039 --> 01:21:52.574
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.643
HEAPING BLAME ON CALIFORNIA A

01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:56.211
STATE THAT IS SUFFERING ITS

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:59.347
WORST FIRE DISASTER EVER.

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:01.116
I WOULD NOT HAVE IMAGINED.

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.550
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD NEGLECT

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:05.420
A TO A HEAVILY POPULATED ISLAND

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.055
DECIMATED BY HURRICANE.

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:09.124
AND YET SEND TROOPS TO LONELY

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.793
OUT LONELY BORDER OUTPOSTS TO DO

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.727
NOTHING.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.463
BUT POSTURE. TWO YEARS AGO

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.499
BEFORE THAT MAN EVEN TOOK OFFICE

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:19.801
I SAID CALIFORNIA MUST BE

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.036
DEFIANT WHENEVER JUSTICE

01:22:21.102 --> 01:22:22.570
FAIRNESS AND RIGHTS JUSTICE

01:22:22.637 --> 01:22:24.939
REQUIRE A WE HAVE BACK THOSE

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.741
ACTIONS UP WITH WORDS.

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.876
WE HAVE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON

01:22:27.942 --> 01:22:29.944
POVERTY WE'VE BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON

01:22:30.011 --> 01:22:32.047
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ON BAIL

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.282
REFORM ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND WE'VE

01:22:34.349 --> 01:22:35.050
BEEN AGGRESSIVE ON EARLY

01:22:35.116 --> 01:22:37.118
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.087
THE ASSEMBLY HAS NOT BEEN ALONE

01:22:39.154 --> 01:22:40.555
IN THIS.

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:41.856
WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY THE

01:22:41.923 --> 01:22:42.123
GOVERNOR.

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.258
THE SENATE.

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.626
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.226
THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND SO

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:47.829
MANY.

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:50.098
BUT NOBODY NOBODY BELIEVES THAT

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:52.000
WE'RE DONE WITH OUR WORK.

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.102
IF WE HAD ALL THE IF WE HAD DONE

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:55.804
ALL THERE IS TO BE DO IT DONE.

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:57.839
THERE BE NO NEED TO BE SWORN IN

01:22:57.906 --> 01:22:59.374
TODAY WE CAN JUST GO HOME.

01:22:59.441 --> 01:23:01.109
MOVE WE'RE NOT GOING OUT.

01:23:01.176 --> 01:23:02.844
WE TEND TO SPEND THE NEXT TWO

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:05.013
YEARS CONTINUING TO MAKE THINGS

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.248
BETTER FOR CALIFORNIANS.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.650
THOSE OF US WHO ARE MEMBERS OF

01:23:08.717 --> 01:23:10.318
ETHNIC MINORITIES OR WOMEN ARE

01:23:10.385 --> 01:23:13.288
PART OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:14.222
I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT FOR OF A

01:23:14.289 --> 01:23:15.256
LATER -- I'M

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:19.728
SURE THAT WHERE.

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:21.029
YOU'RE KIDDING --

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.097
THE CAUCUS SEVEN YEAH.

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:22.864
THOSE IF YOU ARE PART OF OF

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.399
THOSE COMMUNITIES MAY FIND OUR

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.568
TASK ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:23:26.634 --> 01:23:28.470
BECAUSE HISTORICALLY WE FELT

01:23:28.536 --> 01:23:30.004
FROZEN OUT OF THE HALLS OF

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:30.739
DECISION MAKING.

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:32.741
BUT NOW WE'RE HERE.

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.743
AND OUR NUMBERS ARE GROWING.

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.011
LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST IN WHICH

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.613
THE MAJORITY OF ASSEMBLY MEMBERS

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.416
BELONGED TO ETHNIC MINORITIES.

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.817
AND THIS YEAR AS AS HAS BEEN

01:23:42.884 --> 01:23:43.918
STATED.

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:46.788
THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS HAS TWENTY

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:56.164
ONE WOMEN.

01:23:56.231 --> 01:23:57.766
THAT'S AS MANY AS ANY MAJORITY

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.534
CAUCUS IN HISTORY AND NEARLY

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.236
TWICE AS MANY WOMEN.

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.538
AS WHEN I BECAME SPEAKER.

01:24:03.605 --> 01:24:04.973
EACH OF OUR NEW COLLEAGUES HAS

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:07.409
AN INSPIRING LIFE STORY LEADING

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:09.711
TO THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE ASSEMBLY.

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.679
BUFFY WORKS GREW UP IN A MOBILE

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:13.014
HOME IN PLASTER COUNTY.

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:14.516

01:27:44.926 --> 01:27:46.394
AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE BECAUSE

01:27:46.461 --> 01:27:49.163
ECONOMIC INJUSTICE IS A FACTOR.

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:51.966
IN NEARLY EVERYTHING WE WORK ON

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:54.035
WHETHER WE TALK ABOUT IT OR NOT.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:54.669

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.209
CALIFORNIA SETTING.

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:37.245

01:28:54.429 --> 01:28:55.430
THE WORLD INCLUDING CHINA.

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.765

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.511

IF THE UNDENIABLY BRILLIANT

MINDS OF THAT SECTOR ARE USED

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.888
ONLY TO GENERATE HUGE PERSONAL

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:22.657
WEALTH FOR A FEW.

01:29:22.724 --> 01:29:24.792
AND MISERY FOR OTHERS.

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.561
WE MUST USE OUR TECHNOLOGICAL

01:29:26.627 --> 01:29:28.863

01:29:28.930 --> 01:29:31.699

EXTRA ROOMS TO RENT OUT.

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:38.973
WE CAN NOT MAKE HOUSING

01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:40.808
AFFORDABLE FOR THE MASSES WHEN

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:43.211

ON THE BOTTOM.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:13.407
THESE ARE BI PARTISAN CHALLENGES

01:30:13.474 --> 01:30:15.176
THAT REQUIRE BIPARTISAN

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:17.178
SOLUTIONS.

01:30:17.245 --> 01:30:18.679
I BELIEVE THAT THE REPUBLICAN

01:30:18.746 --> 01:30:20.314
CAUCUS HAS A ROLE IN MAKING

01:30:20.381 --> 01:30:21.783
CALIFORNIA BETTER.

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:22.850
MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

AND HEALTH CARE FINANCING.

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.392

WELL AS SHE TAKES OVER AS

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:42.703
REPUBLICAN LEADER.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.504
WE WILL ALSO WORK TOWARD A

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:45.439
BETTER CALIFORNIA IN IN

PRIORITIES. TO REACH THOSE GOALS

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.295
THOUGH IT WILL TAKE WHAT EACH OF

US HAS LEARNED.

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:09.997
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:31:10.064 --> 01:31:11.766
WITH BOTH OF THEM.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.734
BUT MOSTLY WILL DEPEND ON THE

01:31:13.801 --> 01:31:15.503

01:31:15.570 --> 01:31:18.406
