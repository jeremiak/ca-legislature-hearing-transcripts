UNDER THAT BUDGET.

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:37.096 region:rollup2
SO WE.

00:26:35.227 --> 00:26:40.165 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A PROPOSAL.

00:26:37.096 --> 00:26:40.899 region:rollup2
ON ONE OF THE AREAS THAT I KNOW

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:43.569 region:rollup2
WAS REFERENCED.

00:26:40.899 --> 00:26:44.736 region:rollup2
IN THE AGENDA EXTENSIVELY IN A

00:26:43.569 --> 00:26:46.505 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THE CHARTS ON THAT

00:26:44.736 --> 00:26:48.807 region:rollup2
WERE INCLUDED ARE FROM OUR STATE

00:26:46.505 --> 00:26:50.442 region:rollup2
PLAN ON AGING. AND THAT COVERS

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:52.077 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO TWO

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:53.812 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWENTY ONE.

00:26:52.077 --> 00:26:54.746 region:rollup2
BOB THE WAY WE'VE ORGANIZED THAT

00:26:53.812 --> 00:26:56.482 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:26:54.746 --> 00:26:58.016 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO IS

00:26:56.482 --> 00:27:00.486 region:rollup2
THAT WE INCLUDE AN INTRODUCTORY

00:26:58.016 --> 00:27:01.520 region:rollup2
SECTION THAT REALLY LOOKS

00:27:00.486 --> 00:27:02.488 region:rollup2
BROADLY AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.956 region:rollup2
THE SOCIO DEMOGRAPHIC

00:27:02.488 --> 00:27:06.158 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

00:27:03.956 --> 00:27:07.693 region:rollup2
TRENDS THAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF

00:27:06.158 --> 00:27:09.962 region:rollup2
THE AGING OF THE POPULATION.

00:27:07.693 --> 00:27:11.063 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S VERY HELPFUL

00:27:09.962 --> 00:27:12.297 region:rollup2
FOR ALL A NUMBER OF

00:27:11.063 --> 00:27:15.167 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:27:12.297 --> 00:27:16.568 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO

00:27:15.167 --> 00:27:18.403 region:rollup2
PREPARING CONCRETE TO GATHER

00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:20.205 region:rollup2
DATA THAT'S THAT'S HELPFUL IN IN

00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:22.307 region:rollup2
IN ONE LOCATION BUT THE

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:23.942 region:rollup2
REMAINDER OF THE PLAN ALMOND

00:27:22.307 --> 00:27:25.210 region:rollup2
ORCHARDS COMPONENT OF IT. I'M

00:27:23.942 --> 00:27:26.712 region:rollup2
REALLY IS A DOCUMENT THAT WE

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.247 region:rollup2
NEED TO PREPARE TO RECEIVE OUR

00:27:26.712 --> 00:27:30.149 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE

00:27:28.247 --> 00:27:30.782 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ON AGING.

00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:32.784 region:rollup2
AND.

00:27:30.782 --> 00:27:34.920 region:rollup2
SO WE DO SO.

00:27:32.784 --> 00:27:36.288 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.690 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY OPERATE.

00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:39.658 region:rollup2
AREAS WHERE WE GET RECEIVE

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:41.760 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL

00:27:39.658 --> 00:27:43.328 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.864 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE ACTION ON.

00:27:43.328 --> 00:27:47.599 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS AREAS THAT WE THINK.

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:49.635 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NEED TO BE ADDRESSED

00:27:47.599 --> 00:27:51.103 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE

00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:52.170 region:rollup2
DO SO THERE.

00:27:51.103 --> 00:27:54.406 region:rollup2
BUT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS DO

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:55.874 region:rollup2
PLANS FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES TO

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:58.477 region:rollup2
FUTURE PLANS.

00:27:55.874 --> 00:28:00.679 region:rollup2
OUR PLAN WE DO WITH THE INTENT

00:27:58.477 --> 00:28:02.080 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:28:00.679 --> 00:28:03.549 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO ACTUALLY COMPLETE

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.650 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTIVITIES.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.752 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE NOT JUST.

00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:08.153 region:rollup2
KIND OF AMBITIOUS PLANS THAT

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:09.855 region:rollup2
WERE THEN TO GO OUT AND LOOK FOR

00:28:08.153 --> 00:28:11.490 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR WE REALLY DO BELIEVE

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.057 region:rollup2
THAT BY AND LARGE BASED ON WHERE

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:13.292 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE AT THAT POINT IN

00:28:12.057 --> 00:28:14.860 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:16.962 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.064 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THOSE ALTHOUGH I MUST

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:20.766 region:rollup2
SAY WE ALWAYS ADD A FEW LITTLE

00:28:19.064 --> 00:28:21.733 region:rollup2
ASPIRATIONAL.

00:28:20.766 --> 00:28:23.468 region:rollup2
ITEMS THAT WE THINK ARE WITHIN

00:28:21.733 --> 00:28:24.536 region:rollup2
OUR REACH.

00:28:23.468 --> 00:28:25.571 region:rollup2
IT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD PLAN

00:28:24.536 --> 00:28:27.806 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT AS WELL.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:29.675 region:rollup2
.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:31.243 region:rollup2
THE OUR FEDERAL FUNDING COMES TO

00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:33.512 region:rollup2
WAS AS A GRANT

00:28:31.243 --> 00:28:34.947 region:rollup2
A IT IS NOT AND PROPORTIONATE I

00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:36.982 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU'VE GOT THAT. WONDERFUL

00:28:34.947 --> 00:28:38.383 region:rollup2
CHART IN YOUR AGENDA IN TERMS OF

00:28:36.982 --> 00:28:40.285 region:rollup2
THE GROWTH OF THE POPULATION.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:42.120 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT COME YOU KNOW AS

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:43.455 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION GOES UP.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.856 region:rollup2
OR FIND FUNDING DOESN'T

00:28:43.455 --> 00:28:46.658 region:rollup2
AUTOMATICALLY INCREASE IN

00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:48.126 region:rollup2
RELATION TO THAT POPULATION IT'S

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:50.062 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE FACTORS.

00:28:48.126 --> 00:28:51.930 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW THE FEDERAL

00:28:50.062 --> 00:28:52.764 region:rollup2
FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STATES

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.266 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

00:28:52.764 --> 00:28:56.235 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED AND

00:28:54.266 --> 00:28:58.236 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE THOSE FUNDS COME TO

00:28:56.235 --> 00:29:00.872 region:rollup2
WAS AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:29:02.808 region:rollup2
THEN I JUST WAS GONNA GO AHEAD

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:04.142 region:rollup2

PROGRAMS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR

00:29:05.911 --> 00:29:09.047 region:rollup2
I THINK. I'M INTERESTING

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:10.682 region:rollup2

PROGRAM AND TO THAT EXTENT WE

00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:09.127 region:rollup2
ARE MORE FORTUNATE THAN SOME

ADVOCACY AMONG MANY

00:37:19.304 --> 00:37:22.740 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS.

00:37:20.939 --> 00:37:24.342 region:rollup2
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.679 region:rollup2
OF CONGRESS.

00:37:24.342 --> 00:37:29.314 region:rollup2
ATTA IN AND AND WHERE THE SENDS

00:37:27.679 --> 00:37:31.015 region:rollup2
UP BOMB YOU KNOW IN THE NEXT

00:37:29.314 --> 00:37:32.684 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF DAYS. ARM ON THESE

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:34.119 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THEY HAVE BEEN BOTH OF

00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:36.154 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS UNFORTUNATELY

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:38.223 region:rollup2
REPEATEDLY OVER THE YEARS EITHER

00:37:36.154 --> 00:37:39.390 region:rollup2
A HOUSE OR THE SENATE SEEMS TO

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:40.992 region:rollup2
PUT THEM UP FOR.

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:43.862 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS AND THEN

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:47.065 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE RESTORED THEM SO.

00:37:43.862 --> 00:37:47.632 region:rollup2
TWO ONE WEEK TEACH CONTINUE TO

00:37:47.065 --> 00:37:48.933 region:rollup2
KIND OF OPERATE IN THAT MODE

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.901 region:rollup2
AND.

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:51.669 region:rollup2
ADAM.

00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:53.071 region:rollup2
AND AND BE HELPFUL.

00:37:51.669 --> 00:37:54.973 region:rollup2
THE SECOND QUESTION IS REALLY

00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:57.742 region:rollup2
TRYING TO GET AT THE STATE PLAN

00:37:54.973 --> 00:38:00.211 region:rollup2
ON AGING MEANS TO UNDERSTAND.

00:37:57.742 --> 00:38:02.180 region:rollup2
NON. WHETHER IN YOUR VIEW WE'VE

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:03.982 region:rollup2
ALIGNED OR NOT WITH THOSE STATED

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.151 region:rollup2
OBJECTIVES.

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:08.820 region:rollup2
SO OUR OWN OBJECTIVES IN TERMS

00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:11.422 region:rollup2
OF NUTRITION FOR THE STATE PLAN.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:14.793 region:rollup2
HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON.

00:38:11.422 --> 00:38:16.828 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE WE SEE

00:38:14.793 --> 00:38:18.530 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING

00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:21.232 region:rollup2
WITH THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING.

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:21.833 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT HOW WE WE MIGHT

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:22.700 region:rollup2
BETTER INCOME THE COLLABORATE

00:38:21.833 --> 00:38:24.235 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:28.439 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS WE

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:30.909 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY IN TERMS OF OUR OVERALL

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:32.610 region:rollup2
DEMOGRAPHICS REACH A VERY HIGH

00:38:30.909 --> 00:38:33.778 region:rollup2
LEVEL MOST FIFTY PERCENT. OF

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.314 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS IN THE OLDER

00:38:33.778 --> 00:38:38.049 region:rollup2
AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS ARE LOW

00:38:36.314 --> 00:38:41.753 region:rollup2
INCOME.

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:43.454 region:rollup2
MINORITIES ARM. AT AND NOT

00:38:41.753 --> 00:38:44.489 region:rollup2
SURPRISINGLY OF COURSE A HIGH

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:45.890 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE.

00:38:44.489 --> 00:38:48.293 region:rollup2
OUR OUR WOMEN.

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:50.094 region:rollup2
SO WE ARE MEETING OUR FEDERAL

00:38:48.293 --> 00:38:51.362 region:rollup2
TARGETS WELL BUT WE THINK

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:54.766 region:rollup2
THEY'RE STILL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:55.600 region:rollup2
US TO WORK TOGETHER AND IDENTIFY

00:38:54.766 --> 00:38:58.836 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.773 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE

00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:03.208 region:rollup2
LIMITED ENGLISH ACCESS ON FEEL

00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:05.310 region:rollup2
THE BAY OR HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:39:03.208 --> 00:39:08.580 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATION EARLIER IN THEIR

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:10.715 region:rollup2
LIFE CAN BE ENCOURAGED IN AND

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:12.617 region:rollup2
ENGAGED AND.

00:39:10.715 --> 00:39:14.686 region:rollup2
BOTH BOTH PARTICIPATING IN THE

00:39:12.617 --> 00:39:16.988 region:rollup2
NUTRITION PROGRAM AND THE OTHER

00:39:14.686 --> 00:39:19.190 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THE AREA AGENCIES

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:20.792 region:rollup2
PROVIDE AND I THINK THERE

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.994 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AREAS THE STATE YOU

00:39:20.792 --> 00:39:25.797 region:rollup2
KNOW BASED ON DEMOGRAPHICS.

00:39:22.994 --> 00:39:26.531 region:rollup2
WHERE THE AREA AGENCIES HAVE

00:39:25.797 --> 00:39:27.332 region:rollup2
REALLY DEVELOPED SOME UNIQUE?

00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:28.633 region:rollup2
TOOLS FOR DOING THAT

00:39:27.332 --> 00:39:29.467 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY AND ARE YOU KNOW

00:39:28.633 --> 00:39:30.835 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS TO

00:39:29.467 --> 00:39:31.703 region:rollup2
HELP CROSS FERTILIZE. ON THOSE

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:32.670 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES UGH ACROSS OUR

00:39:31.703 --> 00:39:34.205 region:rollup2
NETWORK.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:35.740 region:rollup2
I'M JUST GONNA PUT IN MY TWO

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:37.308 region:rollup2
CENTS CONCERT FROM A MORE RURAL

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:38.676 region:rollup2
AREA I'M ALWAYS GAS WANTING TO

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:40.345 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT OUR RURAL

00:39:38.676 --> 00:39:40.545 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE EQUALLY SERVED

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:42.680 region:rollup2
YES.

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:44.215 region:rollup2
IT SOMETIMES IT'S HARDER FOR US

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:46.584 region:rollup2
TO ACCESS SERVICES BECAUSE OF

00:39:44.215 --> 00:39:48.086 region:rollup2
NEEDING TO TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:48.987 region:rollup2
BUT. ANY EFFORT YOU CAN HAVE

00:39:48.086 --> 00:39:51.723 region:rollup2
WOULD BE GREAT.

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:53.258 region:rollup2
WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN.

00:39:51.723 --> 00:39:55.026 region:rollup2

ON TO ISSUE TO.

00:40:00.598 --> 00:40:10.341 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:11.576 region:rollup2
I MAY NEED TO CREATE SOME SPACE

00:40:10.341 --> 00:40:13.645 region:rollup2
AT THE TABLE IF I CAN FOR CLAY

00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:22.820 region:rollup2
CAM.

00:40:13.645 --> 00:40:24.289 region:rollup2
AND DAVID MORE COLOR.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:34.465 region:rollup2
AND WE WILL START WITH CLAY AND

00:40:24.289 --> 00:40:36.000 region:rollup2
THEN GO ON TO DAVID.

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:37.702 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON CLAY CAMP

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.370 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF.

00:40:37.702 --> 00:40:40.138 region:rollup2
THE AREA AGENCY ON AGING OF

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.573 region:rollup2
SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO

00:40:40.138 --> 00:40:44.742 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND ALSO CALIFORNIA SO

00:40:42.573 --> 00:40:47.211 region:rollup2
SHE SENATE AREA AGENCIES ON

00:40:44.742 --> 00:40:48.579 region:rollup2
AGING LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR.

00:40:47.211 --> 00:40:50.348 region:rollup2
SO REGARDING THE BUDGET

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.849 region:rollup2
AUGMENTATION THERE SOME ARM

00:40:50.348 --> 00:40:52.750 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND AND AND REAL.

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.686 region:rollup2
CRITICAL REASONS WHY WE'RE

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:57.155 region:rollup2
ASKING FOR THIS.

00:40:54.686 --> 00:40:59.057 region:rollup2
I IN THE PAST DECADE STATE FUNDS

00:40:57.155 --> 00:41:00.191 region:rollup2
FOR AGING PROGRAMS FOR OLDER

00:40:59.057 --> 00:41:01.759 region:rollup2
AMERICANS ACT IN ALL THE

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:03.528 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ZACH PROGRAMS.

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:05.530 region:rollup2
HAVE DECREASED BYMORE THAN

00:41:03.528 --> 00:41:06.998 region:rollup2
FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT.

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.399 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT SAME TIME WE'VE SEEN

00:41:06.998 --> 00:41:10.168 region:rollup2
THE POPULATION INCREASED BY

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:11.769 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT INFLATION

00:41:10.168 --> 00:41:13.371 region:rollup2
GOES OUT SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:16.641 region:rollup2
INCREASED NEED AND DECREASE

00:41:13.371 --> 00:41:17.775 region:rollup2
RESOURCES WHICH KIND OF CREATES.

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:19.344 region:rollup2
AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION AND I

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:21.312 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:22.780 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S KIND OF SHOWN BY

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:24.382 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY THERE'S ALMOST ONE

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:26.451 region:rollup2
POINT THREE MILLION

00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:28.619 region:rollup2
NUTRITIONALLY AT RISK SENIORS IN

00:41:26.451 --> 00:41:30.755 region:rollup2
THE STATE. PEOPLE AT THE THREAT

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:32.623 region:rollup2
OF GOING HUNGRY TODAY. TOMORROW

00:41:30.755 --> 00:41:34.158 region:rollup2
OR DAY AFTER TOMORROW.

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:35.660 region:rollup2
THE SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:38.730 region:rollup2
ARE GREAT AT SERVING THOSE

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:39.330 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HOWEVER WERE ONLY SERVING

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:40.932 region:rollup2
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILLION

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:42.600 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW.

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:44.168 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A MILLION SENIORS AT

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
RISK

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:50.141 region:rollup2
OF NOT BEING SERVED.

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:52.744 region:rollup2
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CRISIS.

00:41:50.141 --> 00:41:54.112 region:rollup2
ARM FLAT FUNDING ALSO WAS IT IS

00:41:52.744 --> 00:41:56.414 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO

00:41:54.112 --> 00:41:58.483 region:rollup2
DAMAGE THE PROGRAM EACH YEAR THE

00:41:56.414 --> 00:42:00.451 region:rollup2
COST OF THE MEAL GOES UP ABOUT A

00:41:58.483 --> 00:42:01.786 region:rollup2
QUARTER PER YEAR. WHICH ISN'T A

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:03.521 region:rollup2
WHOLE LOT IT'S MORE THAT IT'S

00:42:01.786 --> 00:42:05.890 region:rollup2
LESS THAN INFLATION BUT IT'S

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:08.459 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT THE PROGRAM SPACE.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:11.028 region:rollup2
SO IF WERE FLAT FUNDED THAT

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:14.399 region:rollup2
EQUATES TO TWELVE HUNDRED FEWER

00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:15.933 region:rollup2
MEALS FOUR VULNERABLE SENIOR PER

00:42:14.399 --> 00:42:17.335 region:rollup2
DAY IN THE STATE.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:18.169 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE COSTA PLAYS OUT

00:42:17.335 --> 00:42:20.037 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SO MANY MEALS ARE

00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:22.774 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SYRUP.

00:42:20.037 --> 00:42:25.343 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY WANT TO URGE ARM

00:42:22.774 --> 00:42:27.145 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE TO FULLY SUPPORT

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:28.880 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET ON INTUITION.

00:42:27.145 --> 00:42:30.615 region:rollup2
I'M WE'VE HAD.

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:32.583 region:rollup2
GREAT SUCCESS IN KEEPING THOSE

00:42:30.615 --> 00:42:34.018 region:rollup2
COSTS LOW THERE'S THOUSANDS OF

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:36.154 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS THE DELIVER THE

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:37.688 region:rollup2
SERVICES OF PROBABLY NO PROGRAM

00:42:36.154 --> 00:42:39.190 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE THAT USES THE MANY

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:40.658 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEERS THIS BUT. I'M YOU

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.693 region:rollup2
KNOW LOOKING AT ALL THE AGING

00:42:40.658 --> 00:42:44.295 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

00:42:42.693 --> 00:42:46.731 region:rollup2
ANYTHING MORE BASIC MORE

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:48.699 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL AND MORE CRITICAL

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:50.001 region:rollup2
THAN ACTUALLY SERVING SOMEBODY.

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:51.702 region:rollup2
A NUTRITIOUS MEAL EVERY DAY. AND

00:42:50.001 --> 00:42:53.971 region:rollup2
IT HAS A HUGE AMOUNT OF COST

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:55.106 region:rollup2
SAVINGS IN TERMS OF AVOIDING

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE

00:42:55.106 --> 00:42:58.843 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS HEALTHCARE

00:42:56.407 --> 00:43:01.112 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY USE WORTH. USE ARM

00:42:58.843 --> 00:43:02.980 region:rollup2
CRITICAL DISEASES ALL THOSE GO

00:43:01.112 --> 00:43:05.516 region:rollup2
OP WHEN SOMEBODY'S NUTRITIONALLY

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.184 region:rollup2
AT RISK HER ARE NUTRITIONALLY

00:43:05.516 --> 00:43:07.452 region:rollup2
SUFFERING.

00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:09.387 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW THERE'S A COST

00:43:07.452 --> 00:43:11.055 region:rollup2
BENEFIT OF THIS.

00:43:09.387 --> 00:43:13.024 region:rollup2
ARM IT'S HARD TO GET THE EXACT

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:14.392 region:rollup2
NUMBERS BUT IT'S SOMETHING WILL

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:15.693 region:rollup2
BE MEETING WITH A A CF WITH THE.

00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TALK

00:43:15.693 --> 00:43:18.896 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THOSE BENEFITS AND

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:20.398 region:rollup2
CRUNCHING NUMBERS SO WE CAN TELL

00:43:18.896 --> 00:43:21.966 region:rollup2
YOU YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS

00:43:20.398 --> 00:43:23.835 region:rollup2
YOU PAY FOR AND HOW MUCH YOU

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:25.636 region:rollup2
SAVE AS A RESULT OF IT.

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:27.872 region:rollup2
ON THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GREAT

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:28.840 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS I THINK EVERY

00:43:27.872 --> 00:43:30.741 region:rollup2
YEAR THE COMMITTEE HAS

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.311 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDED AUGMENTED FUNDING

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:34.679 region:rollup2
FOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND WE'RE

00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:37.381 region:rollup2
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT.

00:43:34.679 --> 00:43:39.083 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WIN THE ISSUE GOES TO

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.885 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE OR GOES TO

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:42.587 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:44.589 region:rollup2
OFFICE WERE WALKING AWAY WITH NO

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:46.691 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:48.359 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE REALLY ASKING YOU GUYS

00:43:46.691 --> 00:43:50.094 region:rollup2
NOT TO TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:52.096 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL

00:43:50.094 --> 00:43:53.965 region:rollup2
ALL THE PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO

00:43:52.096 --> 00:43:56.501 region:rollup2
SHRINK AND SUFFER.

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:58.269 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW IF NOT NOW WHEN TO

00:43:56.501 --> 00:44:00.037 region:rollup2
SOMETHING HAPPEN THE GROWTH IS

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:01.606 region:rollup2
ALMOST EXPONENTIAL OF THE OLDER

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:03.641 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND THAT'S GOING TO

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:04.909 region:rollup2
CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER DECADE. SO

00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:06.377 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A

00:44:04.909 --> 00:44:07.945 region:rollup2
LESSENING OF DEMAND.

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:09.547 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THIS KIND OF A

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:12.316 region:rollup2
CHOICE HERE.

00:44:09.547 --> 00:44:14.218 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T PROVIDE THESE.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:16.487 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE KEEPING PEOPLE

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:17.955 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT TYPE PROGRAMS WE END

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:20.024 region:rollup2
UP WITH MORE EXTENSIVE COST DOWN

00:44:17.955 --> 00:44:22.393 region:rollup2
THE LINE.

00:44:20.024 --> 00:44:24.362 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW LIKE IT OR NOT.

00:44:22.393 --> 00:44:25.763 region:rollup2
GROWTH IN THE SENIOR POPULATION

00:44:24.362 --> 00:44:28.166 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO IMPACT THE BUDGET IN

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:30.334 region:rollup2
A NEGATIVE WAY. AND I THINK WE

00:44:28.166 --> 00:44:31.536 region:rollup2
CAN BE PROACTIVE ABOUT IT AND

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.171 region:rollup2
DECREASE SOME OF THOSE COSTS

00:44:31.536 --> 00:44:35.039 region:rollup2
AND PROVIDE A BETTER QUALITY OF

00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:36.674 region:rollup2
LIFE OR WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:40.044 region:rollup2
WHAT THE CURRENT TREND IS WHICH

00:44:36.674 --> 00:44:41.379 region:rollup2
IS NOTHING. AND HOPE THAT HOPE

00:44:40.044 --> 00:44:43.814 region:rollup2
FOR THE BEST AND AND REALLY

00:44:41.379 --> 00:44:45.516 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY THE ONLY WAY THAT'S

00:44:43.814 --> 00:44:46.384 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE SAVINGS THERE IS IF.

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:48.052 region:rollup2
A WHOLE LOT OF SENIOR START

00:44:46.384 --> 00:44:49.687 region:rollup2
DYING AT A MUCH FASTER RATE THAN

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:50.721 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND I DON'T THINK

00:44:49.687 --> 00:44:53.024 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WANTS THAT

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:54.325 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M JUST URGING TO.

00:44:53.024 --> 00:44:56.093 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY CONSIDER THIS BUDGET

00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:56.694 region:rollup2

00:45:21.085 --> 00:45:25.222 region:rollup2
WHEN THE PREVIOUS PROVIDER I

THE FACT THAT OF PEOPLE FEEL

ISOLATION.

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:42.292 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STUDY THAT CAME OUT

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.394 region:rollup2
THIS PAST YEAR THAT SAID LET

01:02:42.292 --> 01:02:46.930 region:rollup2
LONELINESS WAS A WORSE RISK

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:48.031 region:rollup2
FACTOR THAN OBESITY. AND IT

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.432 region:rollup2
APPLIES TO EVERYONE WITHIN OUR

01:02:48.031 --> 01:02:51.001 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:52.135 region:rollup2
FOR THE ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:53.269 region:rollup2
YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT BUT I

01:02:52.135 --> 01:02:54.504 region:rollup2
WANT YOU TO EXPLICITLY ANSWER IF

YOU CAN.

01:02:54.504 --> 01:02:57.374 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF NO FUNDING

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:58.441 region:rollup2
INCREASE

01:02:57.374 --> 01:03:00.577 region:rollup2
AND HOW MUCH OF THE SEVENTEEN

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:01.111 region:rollup2
MILLION IS NECESSARY JUST TO

01:03:00.577 --> 01:03:03.647 region:rollup2
KEEP YOUR CURRENT SERVICE

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:05.749 region:rollup2
LEVELS?

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:07.250 region:rollup2
FLAT FUNDING WOULD RESULT IN

01:03:05.749 --> 01:03:08.985 region:rollup2
TWELVE HUNDRED ABOUT TWELVE

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:11.021 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MEALS LAS PER DAY OVER

01:03:08.985 --> 01:03:12.989 region:rollup2
YEAR THAT'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:14.491 region:rollup2
AND FIFTY THOUSAND I'M ROUNDING

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:15.859 region:rollup2
OFF A FEW THOUSAND BUT. YOU KNOW

01:03:14.491 --> 01:03:16.960 region:rollup2
GENERALLY THAT'S THE IMPACT OF

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:18.828 region:rollup2
IT.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.296 region:rollup2
I'M THAT'S TAKEN AN AVERAGE OF

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:21.931 region:rollup2
BOTH.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.199 region:rollup2
CONGREGATE DINING CENTERS

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:24.301 region:rollup2
BECAUSE CONGREGATE DINING CENTER

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:25.302 region:rollup2
IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOME

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:28.138 region:rollup2
DELIVERED MEALS.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:29.472 region:rollup2
SO IF.

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:30.440 region:rollup2
I'M I'M FORGETTING WHAT THE

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:32.008 region:rollup2
OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION WAS

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.510 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVEN'T CAN MILLION

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:34.611 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF THAT OUT HOW MUCH

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.012 region:rollup2
THEY'RE A TAPE TO KEEP CURRENTS

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:38.682 region:rollup2
RIGHT LET'S SO IT WOULD TAKE

01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:39.849 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOUR MILLION TO KEEP

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:41.618 region:rollup2
SERVICES FLAT.

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:43.953 region:rollup2

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:34.524 region:rollup2
AND WITH THE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:36.292 region:rollup2
DOLLARS THAT WE'VE LOST FROM OUR

01:06:34.524 --> 01:06:37.961 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:40.663 region:rollup2
I JUST SETTLE LOSSES TO WHERE TO

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:42.665 region:rollup2
LOOK AT NOT GENERAL FUNDS.

01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:44.501 region:rollup2
I'VE HEARD IN ITEM I HEARD IN

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:45.635 region:rollup2
OTHER HEARINGS THAT A DEFENSE

01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.836 region:rollup2
FOR NOT FULLY FUNDING THE

01:06:45.635 --> 01:06:48.037 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS THAT THE

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:49.939 region:rollup2
STATE ALREADY FUNDS LICENSING

01:06:48.037 --> 01:06:51.508 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:53.376 region:rollup2
BUT THE EFFORTS OF THE LOCAL

01:06:51.508 --> 01:06:55.378 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE NOT A DUPLICATION

01:06:53.376 --> 01:06:56.980 region:rollup2
OF SERVICES BECAUSE SO MUCH OF

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:59.549 region:rollup2
WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE RESPONDING

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:00.884 region:rollup2
TO ARE NOT FACILITY REGULATORY

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:02.886 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS OR CRIMINAL

01:07:00.884 --> 01:07:03.486 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS.

01:07:02.886 --> 01:07:05.722 region:rollup2
AT LEAST THEY DON'T START OUT

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:07.790 region:rollup2
THAT WAY.

01:07:05.722 --> 01:07:10.793 region:rollup2
BUT WITHOUT EARLY INTERVENTION

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:12.395 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMS WILL AND DO GROW.

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:14.330 region:rollup2
THEY BECOME COSTLY AND TIME

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.198 region:rollup2
CONSUMING FOR THE STATE.

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:18.034 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE VERY LICENSING

01:07:15.198 --> 01:07:19.235 region:rollup2
AGENCIES.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:20.737 region:rollup2
AND AND HOW IS ONE TO BRING IT

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:22.405 region:rollup2
BACK TO THE RESIDENTS.

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:24.007 region:rollup2
THE NEEDLESS SUFFERING THAT THE

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:25.542 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING WHILE

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:26.643 region:rollup2
WE'RE WAITING FOR LICENSING TO

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:27.644 region:rollup2
GET INVOLVED BECAUSE THE

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:30.246 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS SO UNDER

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:30.813 region:rollup2
FUNDED.

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:32.315 region:rollup2
SO ARE FUNDING REQUEST THIS

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.850 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:35.351 region:rollup2
WE REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:36.786 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS NEED AND WE IDENTIFIED

01:07:35.351 --> 01:07:38.421 region:rollup2
THE FOUR AREAS.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:40.123 region:rollup2
SO THREE POINT FOUR MILLION

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:41.324 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ITS EYES AND EARS WE'VE

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:43.226 region:rollup2
JUST GOT TO GET PEOPLE BACK IN

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:44.994 region:rollup2
OUR FACILITIES. AND WHEN THOSE

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.495 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE IN THE WIND ARE

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:47.630 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN'S ARE IN THE

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:48.865 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THE LOCAL PROGRAMS

01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:50.700 region:rollup2
HAVE ALREADY STARTED THE PROCESS

01:07:48.865 --> 01:07:52.936 region:rollup2
OF IDENTIFYING THEIR MORE

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:54.170 region:rollup2
PROBLEMATIC FACILITY SO THEY CAN

01:07:52.936 --> 01:07:55.838 region:rollup2
SPEND EVEN EXTRA EFFORTS.

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:58.174 region:rollup2
TO RAISE UP THE STANDARDS IN

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:59.309 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMATIC FACILITIES.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:01.177 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:02.245 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN SEED MONEY.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:04.514 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:06.049 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED THAT VOLUNTEERISM HAS

01:08:04.514 --> 01:08:07.550 region:rollup2
DROPPED TO A DRAMATIC LEVEL IN

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:08.918 region:rollup2
OUR LOCAL PROGRAMS.

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:09.986 region:rollup2
AND AND WOULD VERY MUCH

01:08:08.918 --> 01:08:10.987 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:12.322 region:rollup2

01:08:20.296 --> 01:08:23.266 region:rollup2
THE TRAINEES IN THE WORLD DO NOT

01:08:21.798 --> 01:08:24.801 region:rollup2
PAY FOR ADS IN THE LOCAL

01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:27.036 region:rollup2
NEWSPAPER THEY DO NOT PAY FOR

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:28.972 region:rollup2
PRINTING COSTS FOR FLYERS THEY

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:30.573 region:rollup2
DO NOT PAY FOR THE STAFF TIME TO

WONDERFUL RESIDENTS AT THAT WE

FOLLOW UP BUT THE BEST PART OF

01:12:48.965 --> 01:12:52.301 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY DO IS TO BUILD A

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:52.935 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:56.739 region:rollup2
OUR FIELD OMBUDSMAN OVERALL IN

01:12:52.935 --> 01:12:57.306 region:rollup2
THEATERS IT'S CRUCIAL TO HAVE

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:57.707 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY IN THE OFFICE TO BE

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.541 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:12:59.709 region:rollup2
.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.643 region:rollup2
THE THING ABOUT THE ON BUTTON

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.211 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMING YOU PROBABLY KNOW

01:13:00.643 --> 01:13:02.812 region:rollup2
THIS BUT.

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.846 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE DOING WHAT

01:13:02.812 --> 01:13:05.948 region:rollup2
WE DO.

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:06.582 region:rollup2
WE THERE'S NO DUPLICATION OF

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.883 region:rollup2
SERVICES NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO DO

01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:09.719 region:rollup2
IT.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:11.387 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE EQUIPPED TO DO IT

01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:12.655 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S UNUSUAL BECAUSE I YOU

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.056 region:rollup2
KNOW I WORK IN THE NONPROFIT

01:13:12.655 --> 01:13:14.523 region:rollup2
WILL FOR QUITE AWHILE IS ALWAYS

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:15.625 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO SERVES A

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:17.793 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:13:15.625 --> 01:13:18.327 region:rollup2
FROM THIS ANGLE FROM THAT ANGLE

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:19.495 region:rollup2
FROM HERE THEY ALL HAVE A

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:20.896 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FOCUS.

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:22.531 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ONE FOCUS THAT'S

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:24.667 region:rollup2
RESIDENT RIDE THREADS EGGMAN OF

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:26.068 region:rollup2

THEIR VOICE HELPING THEM.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:29.905 region:rollup2
AND NOBODY ELSE DOES IT AND WE

01:13:27.937 --> 01:13:30.506 region:rollup2
DON'T DO IT WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.507 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE SCARY PART BECAUSE

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:33.242 region:rollup2
AS%

01:13:31.507 --> 01:13:34.744 region:rollup2
YOU SEEN THE NUMBER OF

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.746 region:rollup2

NIGHT.

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:41.651 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY BECAUSE A WHO'S WHO DO

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.218 region:rollup2
THE WORK AND WHO'S GOING TO GO

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:45.021 region:rollup2
OUT THERE FOLLOW UP ON THE

01:13:42.218 --> 01:13:47.089 region:rollup2
COMPLACENT ENOUGH TIME.

01:13:45.021 --> 01:13:48.591 region:rollup2
SO BIG A BIG PART OF WHAT LISA

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.959 region:rollup2
SHARE WITH LIZA FAIR REVIEW WAS

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:51.494 region:rollup2
THAT RE BASING WOULD BE VERY

01:13:49.959 --> 01:13:53.229 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL TO OUR PROGRAM IT

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:55.398 region:rollup2
WOULD ALLOW ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS

01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:56.565 region:rollup2
TO HIRE. A PROGRAM COORDINATOR

01:13:55.398 --> 01:13:57.767 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS ARE A.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:59.535 region:rollup2
WHO DON'T HAVE A PROGRAM GOING

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.370 region:rollup2
IN A VOLUNTEER COORDINATOR

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:05.074 region:rollup2
VOLUNTEER MANAGER SOMEONE WHO

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.541 region:rollup2
COULD BE IN? IT TAKE THE ROLE

01:14:05.074 --> 01:14:06.175 region:rollup2
AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:14:05.541 --> 01:14:08.878 region:rollup2
RECRUITING.

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:10.179 region:rollup2
AND RETAINING AND EQUIPPING AND

01:14:08.878 --> 01:14:11.580 region:rollup2
LOVING ON VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE YOU

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:13.249 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.450 region:rollup2
IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IF YOU

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:16.352 region:rollup2
DON'T DO IT WELL IT TAKES A

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.620 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TIME AND I

01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:19.055 region:rollup2
DO IT BUT I STILL HAVE TO DO MY

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.189 region:rollup2
REGULAR JOB.

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:21.624 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD MAKE MY LIFE

01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:22.625 region:rollup2
EASIER TO MAKE ALL OF OUR LIVES

01:14:21.624 --> 01:14:24.260 region:rollup2
EASIER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE A

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.728 region:rollup2
GO TO PERSON WHO WILL ALWAYS BE

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:26.996 region:rollup2
THERE FOR THEM TO GIVE THEM THE

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:29.031 region:rollup2

01:14:29.031 --> 01:14:32.201 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:14:30.633 --> 01:14:34.270 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S THAT WOULD JUST BE

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:35.838 region:rollup2
THEIR CHEERLEADER AND THEIR

01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:37.139 region:rollup2
TRAINER WHATEVER IT IS THEY THEY

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.674 region:rollup2
NEED FROM THAT PERSON THAT'S

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:40.343 region:rollup2
WHAT WE COULD BE ABLE TO DO IF

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.609 region:rollup2
WE HAD. AN INCREASE IN OUR BASE

01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:42.244 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.312 region:rollup2
.

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.047 region:rollup2
IF YOU THINK ABOUT EVERY

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:47.350 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY CHANGES EVERY YEAR EVEN

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:48.551 region:rollup2
THE SMALLEST OF NON PROFITS GETS

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.986 region:rollup2
A THREE PERCENT COST OF LIVING

01:14:48.551 --> 01:14:51.487 region:rollup2
RAISE WHAT WE CAN TWENTY SEVEN

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.055 region:rollup2
YEARS WITH THE SAME BASE

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.856 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:55.291 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IT'S

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:56.792 region:rollup2
UNHELPFUL

01:14:55.291 --> 01:14:59.462 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE HOPING FOR A LITTLE

01:14:56.792 --> 01:15:01.397 region:rollup2

VICIOUS CIRCLE IT WILL HAVE A

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.560 region:rollup2
HUGE IMPACT ON MY BUDGET

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:12.768 region:rollup2
.

01:16:10.766 --> 01:16:14.070 region:rollup2
A BIG PART OF OF.

01:16:12.768 --> 01:16:15.404 region:rollup2
THE THE PROBLEM WITH THE FUNDING

01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:17.673 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE IT WE GO THROUGH

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:19.175 region:rollup2
PROGRAM COORDINATORS IN THIS

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:20.643 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY LIKE CRAZY.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.944 region:rollup2
I REALLY HADN'T SEEN THAT HAPPEN

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:23.446 region:rollup2
OF THE NEXT CLASS NEXT WEEK WE

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:24.580 region:rollup2
HAVE TWELVE NEW ONES.

01:16:23.446 --> 01:16:25.815 region:rollup2

COORDINATORS A THIRD OF THE

01:16:26.649 --> 01:16:29.118 region:rollup2
STATE.

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:31.387 region:rollup2
WHAT DOES THAT SAY?

01:16:29.118 --> 01:16:32.321 region:rollup2
A HARD JOB.

01:16:31.387 --> 01:16:33.823 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NO MONEY AND

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:35.624 region:rollup2
THERE'S NO BUDGET HARDLY TO WORK

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:36.425 region:rollup2
WAY THEN SO BE IT THERE'S ALWAYS

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:38.427 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK IF YOU'RE

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:39.929 region:rollup2

01:46:28.983 --> 01:46:32.119 region:rollup2
QUESTION WHAT WOULD THE EFFECTS

ON PRESENCE IN FREQUENCY FOR

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:37.858 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FACILITIES BE UNDER YOUR

PROPOSAL.

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:40.794 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY SAY THE QUESTION AGAIN

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:42.363 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THE AFFECTS ON

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:44.031 region:rollup2
PRESENTS AND FREQUENCY FOR

01:46:42.363 --> 01:46:47.468 region:rollup2
PROBLEM FACILITIES BE UNDER YOUR

01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:49.870 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL.

01:46:47.468 --> 01:46:51.171 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S GOOD OKAY.

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:52.039 region:rollup2
SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:54.541 region:rollup2
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT.

01:46:52.039 --> 01:46:55.676 region:rollup2
I SAN LUIS OBISPO PROGRAM ARE

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:58.279 region:rollup2
SAN LUIS OBISPO PROGRAM IS

01:46:55.676 --> 01:46:58.812 region:rollup2
PROBABLY OUR BEST FUNDED PROGRAM

01:46:58.279 --> 01:46:59.813 region:rollup2
IF NOT IN THE STATE IN THE

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:01.815 region:rollup2
NATION.

01:46:59.813 --> 01:47:03.484 region:rollup2
AA SENIOR DIED AND LEFT THE

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:06.120 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OVER A MILLION DOLLARS

01:47:03.484 --> 01:47:07.888 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT PROGRAM GETS LESS

01:47:06.120 --> 01:47:08.989 region:rollup2
THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:47:07.888 --> 01:47:10.891 region:rollup2
IN STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY AND

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:12.826 region:rollup2
THEN THEY DREW DOWN OFF OF THAT

01:47:10.891 --> 01:47:15.429 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS. SO THEY WERE

01:47:12.826 --> 01:47:17.531 region:rollup2
ABLE TO GO FROM ONE POINT FIVE

01:47:15.429 --> 01:47:19.400 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TO THREE EMPLOYEES

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:21.101 region:rollup2
THEY WENT FROM NINE VOLUNTEERS

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.236 region:rollup2
TO TWENTY SEVEN VOLUNTEERS THEY

01:47:21.101 --> 01:47:24.705 region:rollup2
WENT FROM ELEVEN HUNDRED

01:47:22.236 --> 01:47:26.607 region:rollup2
FACILITY VISITS TO TWENTY EIGHT

01:47:24.705 --> 01:47:28.075 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FACILITY VISITS.

01:47:26.607 --> 01:47:28.976 region:rollup2
AND YES THE COMPLAINT NUMBERS

01:47:28.075 --> 01:47:30.744 region:rollup2
WENT FROM FIVE HUNDRED TO NINE

01:47:28.976 --> 01:47:33.948 region:rollup2
HUNDRED.

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:34.515 region:rollup2
BUT THE KEY FACTOR.

01:47:33.948 --> 01:47:36.250 region:rollup2
THAT I REALLY WANT TO DRILL

01:47:34.515 --> 01:47:38.919 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:41.088 region:rollup2
THEY WENT FROM TWENTY SIX

01:47:38.919 --> 01:47:42.856 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS OF ELDER ABUSE

01:47:41.088 --> 01:47:45.092 region:rollup2
ALLEGATIONS THAT WERE SEVERE

01:47:42.856 --> 01:47:46.660 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THAT REQUIRED LICENSING

01:47:45.092 --> 01:47:47.962 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:49.763 region:rollup2
THEY WENT FROM TWENTY SIX DOWN

01:47:47.962 --> 01:47:51.732 region:rollup2
TO FOUR.

01:47:49.763 --> 01:47:53.867 region:rollup2
SO EVEN IF YOU DON'T FACTOR IN

01:47:51.732 --> 01:47:56.070 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN THAT TWENTY TWO PEOPLE

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:58.272 region:rollup2
DID NOT EXPERIENCE BAT.

01:47:56.070 --> 01:48:00.207 region:rollup2
TRUMP TRAUMA.

01:47:58.272 --> 01:48:01.809 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH DID IT SAY THE STATE OF

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:03.544 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NOT TO HAVE STATE

01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:05.713 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES TRAVELING BECAUSE

01:48:03.544 --> 01:48:07.281 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NO LOCAL LICENSING

01:48:05.713 --> 01:48:09.049 region:rollup2
OFFICES IN SAN LUIS OBISPO?

01:48:07.281 --> 01:48:10.651 region:rollup2
EVERYONE OF THOSE REQUIRE IT

01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:12.086 region:rollup2
LEAST A FOUR HOUR DRIVE FROM

01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:12.986 region:rollup2

POTENTIALLY HOTEL STAY.

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:17.191 region:rollup2
SO.

01:48:15.389 --> 01:48:18.125 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT GOING TO CHANGE?

01:48:17.191 --> 01:48:19.793 region:rollup2
THE THE CLIMATE IN THE

01:48:18.125 --> 01:48:21.528 region:rollup2

01:48:19.793 --> 01:48:23.998 region:rollup2
THERE IS GOING TO THERE'S GOING

01:48:23.998 --> 01:48:29.937 region:rollup2
TOWARDS EMBRACING A.

01:48:27.968 --> 01:48:30.437 region:rollup2
RESIDENT CENTERED CARE

01:48:29.937 --> 01:48:32.706 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE

OMBUDSMAN STILL WE DON'T SITE

01:48:32.706 --> 01:48:36.243 region:rollup2

FACILITY KINDA GOES ALONG WITH

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:53.794 region:rollup2

SO.

01:49:04.538 --> 01:49:08.876 region:rollup2
IT'S THE THE PRESENCE OF THAT

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:11.211 region:rollup2
NAGGING WATER DRIPPING THAT

I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR

01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:24.491 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS

01:49:32.666 --> 01:49:35.502 region:rollup2

ONE TIME FUNDING WOULD BE OF AN

01:49:35.502 --> 01:49:38.739 region:rollup2
UNDERSTATEMENT ONE TIME FUNDING

01:49:36.804 --> 01:49:40.841 region:rollup2
HAS ALLOWED US TO TO KEEP THE

01:49:38.739 --> 01:49:44.611 region:rollup2
DOORS OPEN AND HAS. GIVEN US THE

BETTER.

01:49:48.749 --> 01:49:53.287 region:rollup2
PHONE SYSTEMS ARE LARGER

01:49:51.084 --> 01:49:57.157 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS CAN USE THAT MONEY TO

01:49:53.287 --> 01:49:59.726 region:rollup2
HIRE STAFF BECAUSE THEY CAN.

01:49:57.157 --> 01:50:01.095 region:rollup2
BACK FILL UNTIL THAT ONE TIME

01:49:59.726 --> 01:50:03.030 region:rollup2
MONEY ACTUALLY HITS THE PROGRAM

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:03.764 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.997 region:rollup2
BUT OUR SMALLER PROGRAMS JUST

01:50:03.764 --> 01:50:06.834 region:rollup2
CAN'T.

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:08.302 region:rollup2
.

01:50:06.834 --> 01:50:10.270 region:rollup2
THE MONEY MAY BE IN THE JULY

01:50:08.302 --> 01:50:12.706 region:rollup2
BUDGET BUT IT'S NOT IN THEIR

01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:13.974 region:rollup2
CONTRACT THAT STARTED IN JULY.

01:50:12.706 --> 01:50:15.409 region:rollup2
SO YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:17.244 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF AGING STARTS THEIR

01:50:15.409 --> 01:50:19.113 region:rollup2
CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH IS THE END

01:50:17.244 --> 01:50:20.414 region:rollup2
OF SEPTEMBER. AND THEN THEY HAVE

01:50:19.113 --> 01:50:21.748 region:rollup2
NINETY DAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE

01:50:20.414 --> 01:50:23.217 region:rollup2
ENTERING A CONTRACT WITH THE

01:50:21.748 --> 01:50:24.918 region:rollup2
TRIP LAYS AND THEN THE TRIPLE

01:50:23.217 --> 01:50:26.286 region:rollup2
A.'S GET NINETY DAYS TO ENTER

01:50:24.918 --> 01:50:28.822 region:rollup2
INTO A CONTRACT WITH THE

01:50:26.286 --> 01:50:30.224 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM. SO WHILE WE

01:50:28.822 --> 01:50:32.126 region:rollup2
ARE APPRECIATIVE THAT WE GOT A

01:50:30.224 --> 01:50:34.261 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS ON JULY FIRST

01:50:32.126 --> 01:50:35.729 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE

01:50:34.261 --> 01:50:38.665 region:rollup2
LOCAL PROGRAMS IS STILL HAVEN'T

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:40.334 region:rollup2
GOTTEN ANY OF THEIR SHARE. YET.

01:50:38.665 --> 01:50:42.402 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT

01:50:40.334 --> 01:50:43.370 region:rollup2
TAKES TO GET THE.

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:45.439 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONE OF THE NEGATIVE

01:50:43.370 --> 01:50:46.840 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF ONE FAMILY MONEY

01:50:45.439 --> 01:50:48.208 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HIRING SOMEONE WITH THE

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:50.377 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WORKING TO KEEP

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:51.645 region:rollup2
YOU FOR MAYBE. NINE MONTHS AND

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:53.747 region:rollup2
THEN WE GONNA LET YOU GO.

01:50:51.645 --> 01:50:55.549 region:rollup2
THE OTHER PART OF.

01:50:53.747 --> 01:50:56.049 region:rollup2
PROBLEM OF ONE TIME MANY IS WE

01:50:55.549 --> 01:50:57.784 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ONE TIME ONLY

01:50:56.049 --> 01:50:58.685 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

01:50:57.784 --> 01:50:59.753 region:rollup2
WE HAVE PROBLEMS THAT ARE

01:50:58.685 --> 01:51:01.522 region:rollup2
ONGOING.

01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:01.688 region:rollup2
AND.

01:51:01.522 --> 01:51:03.290 region:rollup2
IT.

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:05.125 region:rollup2
YES IF YOU GAVE ME TWO MILLION

01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:06.927 region:rollup2
DOLLARS FOR VOLUNTEER I

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:08.595 region:rollup2
RECRUITED PROGRAM THAT BE GREAT.

01:51:06.927 --> 01:51:10.764 region:rollup2
BUT IT WOULD TAKE US TIME TO

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:12.1000 region:rollup2
CREATE THE COLLATERAL TO CREATE

01:51:10.764 --> 01:51:15.335 region:rollup2
THE THE THE.

01:51:12.1000 --> 01:51:16.937 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TO ACTUALLY GET

01:51:15.335 --> 01:51:18.238 region:rollup2
THOSE VOLUNTEERS IN THE DOOR.

01:51:16.937 --> 01:51:19.740 region:rollup2
SO WE MIGHT RUN OUT OF TIME

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:20.841 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE WE RAN OUT OF THOSE

01:51:19.740 --> 01:51:21.742 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IT IF THEY WERE JUST IN

01:51:20.841 --> 01:51:23.777 region:rollup2
THAT AREA.

01:51:21.742 --> 01:51:24.878 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:51:23.777 --> 01:51:27.181 region:rollup2
ALSO SOMETIMES ONE TIME MONEY

01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:28.782 region:rollup2
HARMS US.

01:51:27.181 --> 01:51:31.084 region:rollup2
A FEW YEARS BACK THE VENTURA

01:51:28.782 --> 01:51:32.586 region:rollup2
PROGRAM RECEIVED A GRANT THAT

01:51:31.084 --> 01:51:34.221 region:rollup2
THEY BELIEVE WOULD BE ONGOING IN

01:51:32.586 --> 01:51:36.690 region:rollup2
NATURE. AND THE GRANT WAS

01:51:34.221 --> 01:51:38.058 region:rollup2
DIRECTED TOWARDS RESIDENTS THAT

01:51:36.690 --> 01:51:40.661 region:rollup2
WERE NON ENGLISH SPEAKING.

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:43.063 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT PROGRAM CREATED

01:51:40.661 --> 01:51:45.232 region:rollup2
COLLATERAL POSTERS FLYERS TO

01:51:43.063 --> 01:51:46.934 region:rollup2
PROMOTE ON THIS AND ACTIVITIES

01:51:45.232 --> 01:51:48.835 region:rollup2
FOR OUR SPANISH A SPEAKING

01:51:46.934 --> 01:51:51.038 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS. THE THE LOCAL PROGRAM

01:51:48.835 --> 01:51:52.372 region:rollup2
HIRED AND TRAINED SPANISH

01:51:51.038 --> 01:51:54.575 region:rollup2
SPEAKING OMBUDSMAN

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:51.729 region:rollup2
FROM THE STATE TO THE HEALTH

02:32:50.161 --> 02:32:53.264 region:rollup2
PLANS. WHO IN THE TRANSITION

02:32:51.729 --> 02:32:55.633 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE THE ONES WHO ARE

02:32:53.264 --> 02:32:56.634 region:rollup2
PAIN MSP DIRECTLY NOW?

02:32:55.633 --> 02:32:58.202 region:rollup2
I'M I THINK BUT FOR ME THE

02:32:56.634 --> 02:32:59.737 region:rollup2
BIGGEST THING IS TO KEEP IN MIND

02:32:58.202 --> 02:33:01.072 region:rollup2
IS WE'RE STILL NOT THERE FOR

02:32:59.737 --> 02:33:02.840 region:rollup2
TRANSITION WERE BLEEDING NOW.

02:33:01.072 --> 02:33:04.308 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE AND THE RATE THAT WERE

02:33:02.840 --> 02:33:06.077 region:rollup2
BEING PAID IS THE EXACT SAME

02:33:04.308 --> 02:33:08.346 region:rollup2
RATE TO THAT IF YOU ARE A IF IT

02:33:06.077 --> 02:33:09.714 region:rollup2
WAS IT WAS IT WAS DONE ON A RATE

02:33:08.346 --> 02:33:11.049 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE BASSIST AND WAS A

02:33:09.714 --> 02:33:13.051 region:rollup2
SIMPLE MATH EQUATION TAKING THE

02:33:11.049 --> 02:33:14.952 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF DOLLARS. DIVIDED BY

02:33:13.051 --> 02:33:16.688 region:rollup2
SLOTS KIND OF THING SO IT WOULD

02:33:14.952 --> 02:33:18.723 region:rollup2
WORK AT THE SAME RATE EVERYWHERE

02:33:16.688 --> 02:33:19.624 region:rollup2
SO ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THE

02:33:18.723 --> 02:33:21.359 region:rollup2
MECHANISM THE STATE WOULD USE.

02:33:19.624 --> 02:33:23.161 region:rollup2
TO GET THAT MONEY DOWN TO US

02:33:21.359 --> 02:33:24.228 region:rollup2
WERE ALL STILL BE PAYMENT PAYING

02:33:23.161 --> 02:33:26.030 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW AND UNTIL AND THERE'S

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:27.932 region:rollup2
WE WE'RE NOT IT TRANSITION YET

02:33:26.030 --> 02:33:30.068 region:rollup2
THE EXACT SAME THING AND NEEDING

02:33:27.932 --> 02:33:33.805 region:rollup2
TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. BUT

02:33:30.068 --> 02:33:35.173 region:rollup2
HEALTH BUT DOESN'T SPEAK TO NON.

02:33:33.805 --> 02:33:36.474 region:rollup2

02:39:11.275 --> 02:39:15.579 region:rollup2
SAW MY FATHER HITTING MY SISTER.

02:39:13.944 --> 02:39:17.415 region:rollup2
SO HE APPROACHED THE CAR QUICKLY

02:39:15.579 --> 02:39:19.183 region:rollup2
AND.

02:39:17.415 --> 02:39:20.217 region:rollup2

02:39:34.532 --> 02:39:39.904 region:rollup2
IN OR I AM TAKING THEM TO THE

02:39:36.467 --> 02:39:41.639 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM YOU CHOOSE.

02:39:39.904 --> 02:39:43.741 region:rollup2

02:39:41.639 --> 02:39:45.309 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ROOM.

02:39:43.741 --> 02:39:47.611 region:rollup2
AFTER THREE DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL

02:39:45.309 --> 02:39:48.345 region:rollup2
AFTER NUMEROUS TESTS.

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:50.614 region:rollup2
WE WERE TOLD THAT HE HAD

02:39:48.345 --> 02:39:52.216 region:rollup2
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

02:39:50.614 --> 02:39:53.517 region:rollup2
HE WAS THEN DISCHARGED TO A

02:39:52.216 --> 02:39:56.086 region:rollup2
FIFTY BAD ASSISTED LIVING

02:39:53.517 --> 02:39:57.488 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY THAT AT THE TIME ONLY

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:58.756 region:rollup2
HAD TWO STAFF MEMBERS.

02:39:57.488 --> 02:40:00.357 region:rollup2
WHO HAD BEEN TRAINED TO ASSIST

02:39:58.756 --> 02:40:02.860 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WITH MEMORY?

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:04.662 region:rollup2
AND ISSUES.

02:40:02.860 --> 02:40:06.397 region:rollup2
MY FATHER LIVED TWO YEARS IN THE

02:40:04.662 --> 02:40:07.565 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BEFORE HE DIED.

02:40:06.397 --> 02:40:09.667 region:rollup2
HE DECLINED VERY QUICKLY THE

02:40:07.565 --> 02:40:11.202 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR.

02:40:09.667 --> 02:40:12.269 region:rollup2
LOS TOP OF ITS WAY AND IN THE

02:40:11.202 --> 02:40:14.605 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR HE DIDN'T KNOW HIS

02:40:12.269 --> 02:40:15.973 region:rollup2
FAMILY.

02:40:14.605 --> 02:40:18.509 region:rollup2
THIS DEVASTATED OUR FAMILY

02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:20.377 region:rollup2
IMMENSELY MY MOTHER IN THAT TIME

02:40:18.509 --> 02:40:21.879 region:rollup2
HAD TWO STROKES.

02:40:20.377 --> 02:40:23.214 region:rollup2
OUR LIVES WERE TURNED COMPLETELY

02:40:21.879 --> 02:40:25.649 region:rollup2
UPSIDE DOWN TRYING TO BE

02:40:23.214 --> 02:40:27.451 region:rollup2
INVOLVED. IN HIS LIFE AND IN HIS

02:40:25.649 --> 02:40:28.919 region:rollup2
NEW CARE SETTING.

02:40:27.451 --> 02:40:29.620 region:rollup2
TO THIS DAY I BELIEVE IN MY

02:40:28.919 --> 02:40:31.622 region:rollup2
HEART.

02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:34.058 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:40:31.622 --> 02:40:35.960 region:rollup2
OUR DADS QUALITY OF LIFE

02:40:34.058 --> 02:40:37.528 region:rollup2
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LENGTH

02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:38.496 region:rollup2
OF HIS LIFE. AND THE QUALITY OF

02:40:37.528 --> 02:40:39.730 region:rollup2
OUR LIVES

02:40:38.496 --> 02:40:40.264 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFERENT

02:40:39.730 --> 02:40:42.333 region:rollup2
IN THOSE FIVE YEARS HAD WE

02:40:40.264 --> 02:40:44.969 region:rollup2
KNOWN.

02:40:42.333 --> 02:40:46.904 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

02:40:44.969 --> 02:40:48.806 region:rollup2
AND HAD A BETTER SUPPORT HIS

02:40:46.904 --> 02:40:49.673 region:rollup2
DISEASE PROCESS AT HOME.

02:40:48.806 --> 02:40:52.109 region:rollup2
EVEN HOW TO ADD TO THE

02:40:49.673 --> 02:40:55.279 region:rollup2
ENRICHMENT OF HIS VERY FINAL

02:40:52.109 --> 02:40:57.114 region:rollup2
YEARS IN THE COMMUNITY HOME.

02:40:55.279 --> 02:40:59.383 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING HIS DIGNITY WHICH

02:40:57.114 --> 02:41:01.819 region:rollup2
WAS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.

02:40:59.383 --> 02:41:03.554 region:rollup2
MY MOM IS NOW IN THE EARLIER

02:41:01.819 --> 02:41:06.390 region:rollup2
STAGES OF DEMENTIA.

02:41:03.554 --> 02:41:08.425 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.

02:41:06.390 --> 02:41:10.461 region:rollup2
KNOWING WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

02:41:08.425 --> 02:41:11.695 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE THIS

02:41:10.461 --> 02:41:13.664 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN VERY

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:15.132 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FOR OUR FAMILY.

02:41:13.664 --> 02:41:17.968 region:rollup2
WE ARE PREPARING NOW FOR WHAT WE

02:41:15.132 --> 02:41:20.471 region:rollup2
KNOW WILL COME.

02:41:17.968 --> 02:41:22.306 region:rollup2
I FEAR TO. THAT I WILL GET THIS

02:41:20.471 --> 02:41:23.407 region:rollup2
DISEASE AND I WANT MY CHILDREN

02:41:22.306 --> 02:41:25.576 region:rollup2
TO BE INFORMED.

02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:26.777 region:rollup2
AM PREPARED.

02:41:25.576 --> 02:41:28.479 region:rollup2
I HAVE A FAMILY HISTORY OF

02:41:26.777 --> 02:41:30.114 region:rollup2
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

02:41:28.479 --> 02:41:31.949 region:rollup2
I'VE HAD A STROKE I'VE HAD A

02:41:30.114 --> 02:41:35.286 region:rollup2
BRAIN INJURY.

02:41:31.949 --> 02:41:37.121 region:rollup2
I AM A WOMAN. AND I AM LATINA.

02:41:35.286 --> 02:41:38.822 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE THINGS INCREASE MY

02:41:37.121 --> 02:41:41.392 region:rollup2
WRISTS FOR GETTING THIS DISEASE

02:41:38.822 --> 02:41:41.926 region:rollup2
AND I AM SCARED.

02:41:41.392 --> 02:41:44.261 region:rollup2
IN MY WORK IN THE CENTRAL

02:41:41.926 --> 02:41:46.797 region:rollup2
VALLEY.

02:41:44.261 --> 02:41:49.500 region:rollup2
I SEE THE DIFFERENCE ON A DAILY

02:41:46.797 --> 02:41:51.802 region:rollup2
BASIS THE FAMILIES WHO WALKIN.

02:41:49.500 --> 02:41:54.338 region:rollup2
IN CRISIS I SEE THEM BROKEN AND

02:41:51.802 --> 02:41:56.507 region:rollup2
LOST JUST LIKE MY FAMILY ROOTS.

02:41:54.338 --> 02:41:57.875 region:rollup2
AND I SEE THE TIME THAT IT TAKES

02:41:56.507 --> 02:41:59.810 region:rollup2
TO GET THEM TO BEGIN TO RECOVER

02:41:57.875 --> 02:42:02.112 region:rollup2
FROM THE IMPACT.

02:41:59.810 --> 02:42:04.248 region:rollup2
SOME NEVER DO.

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:06.383 region:rollup2
THE ROAD IS LONG AND IT'S HARD.

02:42:04.248 --> 02:42:07.918 region:rollup2
SPENCER.

02:42:06.383 --> 02:42:09.787 region:rollup2
MANY WITH INCREASED HEALTH

02:42:07.918 --> 02:42:11.221 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF THEIR OWN BECAUSE OF

02:42:09.787 --> 02:42:13.224 region:rollup2
THE DEMANDS OF CAREGIVING TO DO

02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:15.025 region:rollup2
THEIR VERY FAST.

02:42:13.224 --> 02:42:17.761 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALWAYS.

02:42:15.025 --> 02:42:19.163 region:rollup2
I HERE OUR STAFF HERE'S I WISH I

02:42:17.761 --> 02:42:20.297 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT YOU I

02:42:19.163 --> 02:42:22.299 region:rollup2
WISH I WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT

02:42:20.297 --> 02:42:23.033 region:rollup2
ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.

02:42:22.299 --> 02:42:26.170 region:rollup2
I WOULD IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO

02:42:23.033 --> 02:42:27.805 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

02:42:26.170 --> 02:42:29.506 region:rollup2
AND I SEE THE DIFFERENCE THE

02:42:27.805 --> 02:42:32.243 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN

02:42:29.506 --> 02:42:33.444 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WHO COME MEAN EVEN WITH

02:42:32.243 --> 02:42:35.479 region:rollup2
VERY BASIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE

02:42:33.444 --> 02:42:37.915 region:rollup2
DISEASE.

02:42:35.479 --> 02:42:39.350 region:rollup2
AND WHAT IT MAKES.

02:42:37.915 --> 02:42:40.084 region:rollup2
WHAT DIFFERENCE IT MAKES IN

02:42:39.350 --> 02:42:41.952 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN LIVES AND IN THEIR

02:42:40.084 --> 02:42:43.520 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S LIVES?

02:42:41.952 --> 02:42:45.723 region:rollup2
IN THEIR HOPE AN INTER DESIRE TO

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:46.924 region:rollup2
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE DISEASE AND

02:42:45.723 --> 02:42:48.092 region:rollup2
HOW THEY CAN BETTER SUPPORT

02:42:46.924 --> 02:42:51.528 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILY MEMBER AND THEIR

02:42:48.092 --> 02:42:53.530 region:rollup2
LOVED ONE.

02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:55.265 region:rollup2
THEY ARE PROACTIVE IN THEIR

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:56.367 region:rollup2
LOVED ONES CARE THEY ADVOCATE

02:42:55.265 --> 02:42:58.369 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THEY

02:42:56.367 --> 02:42:59.770 region:rollup2
PREPARE THE ATTEND EDUCATIONAL

02:42:58.369 --> 02:43:01.238 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TO LEARN TO BE BETTER

02:42:59.770 --> 02:43:03.907 region:rollup2
CARE GIVERS.

02:43:01.238 --> 02:43:05.509 region:rollup2
AND THE PLAN FOR THE FUTURE.

02:43:03.907 --> 02:43:08.078 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS THEY ALSO LEARN

02:43:05.509 --> 02:43:09.413 region:rollup2
HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:10.748 region:rollup2
AND THIS GREATLY IMPACTS THE

02:43:09.413 --> 02:43:13.150 region:rollup2
QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERYONE

02:43:10.748 --> 02:43:15.886 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

02:43:13.150 --> 02:43:17.721 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY MY DAD IS

02:43:15.886 --> 02:43:19.957 region:rollup2
NO LONGER WITH US.

ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN OUR

02:43:22.793 --> 02:43:25.863 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES WE DESPERATELY NEED

02:43:24.128 --> 02:43:28.098 region:rollup2
AT.

02:43:25.863 --> 02:43:29.533 region:rollup2
THERE'S TOO MUCH DEVASTATION

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:30.734 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

02:43:29.533 --> 02:43:33.737 region:rollup2
AWARENESS

02:43:30.734 --> 02:43:35.272 region:rollup2
MY STORY I I WOULD LOVE TO TELL

02:43:33.737 --> 02:43:36.940 region:rollup2
YOU THAT IT IS. A VERY UNUSUAL

02:43:35.272 --> 02:43:39.443 region:rollup2

IT IT'S NOT WE HEAR CRISIS

02:43:39.443 --> 02:43:44.481 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY ON FROM FAMILIES THAT

SO I AM HERE TO PASS AND AND I

02:43:49.453 --> 02:43:52.656 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE WAS SANDBAGGING

02:43:50.721 --> 02:43:53.991 region:rollup2
EARLIER SO I AM WILLING TO BACK

S. LIKE THAT I THINK THE

THOSE WEEKS.

02:44:32.229 --> 02:44:36.333 region:rollup2

FINANCIAL SAVINGS WAS GONE.

02:49:35.766 --> 02:49:39.636 region:rollup2
AND I THINK FOR ME IS AN

02:49:37.234 --> 02:49:41.238 region:rollup2
OMBUDSMAN THE HARDEST PART WAS.

02:49:39.636 --> 02:49:42.806 region:rollup2
HER COGNITIVE ABILITY TO

LESS STRESSFUL FOR THE FAMILY.

02:50:04.094 --> 02:50:07.364 region:rollup2
