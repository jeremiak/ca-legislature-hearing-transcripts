A SERVING IN THIS CAPACITY- I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS REGARDING TECHNOLOGY AND THE TECHNOLOGY CHANGE AND HOW DOES THE COMMISSION WORK TO ENSURE THAT GAMBLING REGULATIONS EVOLVE TO MATCH THE EVER CHANGING NEEDS OF THE INDUSTRY MISSION CARD ROOMS EARLIER I'M- JUST CURIOUS SHALL WE- KIND OF TOOK A LEAD AS FAR AS EARLY ON- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WORRIES. START LOOKING INTO A TECHNOLOGY ITSELF- AS FAR AS TO- SECURITY AND PORTABILITY AS FAR AS LAPTOP AND SO FOR. SOME INDEPENDENT MAKE. OCCURRED AND WE WERE ALL PRETTY MUCH READY TO GO. SO I THINK THAT THE COMMISSION ITSELF IS PRETTY. TOUGH FOR THINKING. NOW COMING TO THE COURT ROOM JOHN YOU. HAVE AREAS LEVELS- FONG. AS FAR AS SIZE OF. SO THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF LOOK AT AND REVIEW ON THE FIRST LIKE TO WE DID THE- JEEP HOW CAN POLICY ADVISER. THE PROJECT ON SERBIA. SO THAT IS SOMETHING TECHNOLOGY THAT- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO HAVE BETTER TECHNOLOGY DIVERSITY GET DOWN HIGH. AND HAVING ALSO- OF WHERE TO PLACE IN THE OF THE CAMERAS AND SO FORTH. SO X. WAS A SECURITY. MONITOR AND ALL THAT. WHICH IS BEFORE THAT WERE THE DEATH SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO ASK ME. WORKING LOCKHEED TO GAIN ADVISORY INDUSTRY. TO KIND OF. A PUSH FORWARD IN THAT AREA A SECURITY IDEA INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY LIKE CONVENTION. SQUARE IS THAT. IS THAT- THE IT'S VERY RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF- SECURITY AS FAR AS BRIDGES AND HOPEFULLY THAT INDUSTRY WOULD TAKE IT TO A LOT OF THE SMALLER CAR ROOMS. MAY NOT HAVE THAT KIND OF CERTIFICATIONS BUT I THINK THEY ARE LOOKING MORE WHERE IT. YEAH OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED BECAUSE YOU DID BRING UP THE PANDEMIC I WAS CURIOUS I KNOW THAT CARD ROOMS WERE CONSIDER ESSENTIAL PEOPLE RIGHT THERE. DO YOU SEE RECOVERY HAPPENING NOW OR WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE RECOVERY FOR THE GAMING INDUSTRY- BECAUSE OF THE PAIN THE RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. L. AS FAR AS- OSTS STABBING OF THE CAR ROOMS THAT'S LICENSING- FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. MONTHS I'VE BEEN THERE I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY DECREASES- MY- FINDERS- NUMBER OF PAGES. HAS NOT DIMINISHED- I SEE THE APPLICANTS COMING THROUGH EITHER RENEW OR NEW LICENSE A LICENSE COMING THROUGH. SO I HAVEN'T SEEN IT DIMINISH OF THAT AREA ABSORBERS. THE CARD MYSELF THE DEALERS EXCEPT TRUCK- I I'M NOT TOO SURE WHERE THERE'S LIKE IN THE AREAS OF THE HOME. SUPPORT KITCHEN IN THAT PERIOD THERE'S OTHER AREAS LIKE HOTELS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IT TEARS UP THEIR CASINOS ACT LARGE- BUT HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. DIMINISH THE CARGO OKAY THANK YOU. SIR I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU. MUCH IS THANK YOU CENTER GROWTH IS COM LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM TEMP I TO- BELIEVE YOU TO BE QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION AND- IT REALLY ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS- YOUR THOUGHTS ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS- EVER CHANGING WORLD OF OURS AS IT RELATES TO GAMBLING. IN CURRENCY WHERE YOU THINK DIGITAL CURRENCY. OUT WILL BEGIN TO PLAY A ROLE IN- GAMBLING ESTABLISHMENTS- AND- ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN YOUR ROLE IN THAT. WELL RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW LIKE CRYPTOCURRENCY- IS NOT LEGAL BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEEN- MY STANDING RECOGNIZER IS NOT A CAN OF. RECOGNIZE CURRENCY SO AND THEN NOT SENSE IS NOT IN THE CAR I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING HAS COME THROUGH- SENATOR AS FAR AS IN YOUR FINANCIALS REPORTS OF CURRENCIES. SO I AND- I'M SURE IN INS DOWN THE LINE WE HAVE TO A TRUSTED- BUT RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW IT IS SIX EIGHT- NOT LEGAL. TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION INTERTWINED OF THE FUNDS OF INTERMINGLED THE. FUNDS WITH CASH ITSELF. THE DAY IS TRUE THIS GIVEN THE FACT THAT- EIGHT WELL LET LOTS OF FOLKS ARE INTERESTED IN IT AND I GUESS YOU KNOW FEDERALLY THERE'S BEEN A- REQUEST TO KIND OF- THIRTY EIGHT AND- DISFIGURING ALL KINDS O THINGS HAPPEN IN THESE CARD ROOMS WANTED JUST TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS BUT- THIS IS. DOWN THE LINE I AM SURE- I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU WHEN THE CONFIRMATION COMES UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR KAMLAGER MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU I HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A MINUTE MISTER LIU SO I'M NOT SURE OF. MY QUESTIONS ARE ALREADY AT HALF THE IF SO YOU CAN- CERTAINLY MENTION THAT BUT I THINK IN YOUR- GOALS HERE ONE THAT FELT REALLY JUMPS OFF THE PAGE AND SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL VERY CONCERNED WITH THIS- TO FURTHER ADVANCE CALIFORNIA AS A NATIONAL LEADER IN GAMBLING REGULATION. WHILE MAINTAINING STRONG PUBLIC TRUST I THINK THE CONCERN HAS BEEN ABOUT THE CRIMINAL ELEMENT GETTING IN AND- BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THEIR OPERATIONS ON ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE. AND ALSO THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL THE REGULATIONS BE WRITTEN. THAT THEY WILL COVER THE EVER CHANGING OF MONEY LAUNDERING WORLD KNOWING THAT MONEY LAUNDERING AS BEYOND A- BIT OF. BIT OF AN ISSUE PROBABLY A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN TERMS OF ALL THE TRUST. THAT'S THERE SO IF YOU COULD ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. ON THAT WOULD BE I THINK IMPORTANT TO HEAR. I THANK YOUNG MONEY LEARNING LIKE YOU MENTIONED THIS- DISPATCHER IMPORTANT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF ACCOUNT CALIFORNIA CARBON. INDUSTRY WORKING GAMING INDUSTRY PERIOD. AND I THINK IT'S- EFFORT MONEY LAUNDERING. WE WILL. YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A- ENTITY- CARBON DENSIFIED- WITH MONEY LAUNDERING THE YOU KNOW THAT WE AS THE COMMISSIONERS COURT CONDITIONS ON IT ON RENEWALS. AND IF YOU'RE A WILL EVALUATE OR DOING YOUR DESTINATION WHEN YOU. TAKE MORE SCRUTINY OF THAT NATURE- ON THE NEW PART. SO WE TRIED TO AND FINALLY MY MARKET BEGAN FIRING ON. AND CONTINUE MONITORING THAT WE MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL. REQUIREMENTS CONDITIONS AT THREE YOU KNOW RECORDING REQUIREMENTS OR CONSULTING- THE VALUATION AND EVALUATIONS REQUIREMENTS. BUT AS FAR AND SO THAT'S ONE AREA. THE OTHER AREA IS MATIC YOU MENTIONED THE TRANSACTION RODRIGUEZ TOWARDS. THAT POINT. I BELIEVE IT LOOKS THE KIND. BUT I HAVE NOTS IT- I UNDERSTAND IS THAT PACKAGE GOING A FINE STAGE REVIEW INTO BY. THE STAFF AND WE SEE THAT LATER ON THIS YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SURE WHAT TIME LATER ON THIS YEAR SO- SHE DID THAT HER HOPEFULLY THAT WILL CAPTURE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT.

THANK YOU THAT THAT ANSWERED ACTUALLY A SECOND OF THAT QUESTION SO THANK YOU I WONDERED WHAT THE STATUS WAS. THE WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO CALL FOR THOSE SO THAT. THIS WILL NO LONGER KIND OF.

MY STEPFATHER CAN'T HE WAS RETIRED AND THAT SHRINK AND MY SON XAVIER AND ENERGETIC KINDERGARTNER WHO. LOVES TO CONTAX SCIENCE PROJECTS. MARQUAM HAS BEEN A PASSION OF FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW WHEN I LOOK BACK MY INTEREST IN A WIDER BEGAN IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WHEN I FIRST LEARNED OF THE WATER CYCLE. INTEREST CONTINUES TO GROW THROUGHOUT HIGH SCHOOL AND BECAME A PASSION IN COLLEGE WHEN I DECIDE TO BECOME A CIVIL ENGINEER. WITH A FOCUS ON WATER QUALITY. EARLY IN MY CAREER AND MADE A DECISION TO WORK IN BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS. TO LEARN FROM EACH YEAR POINT OUT POLICIES AND REGULATIONS ARE DEVELOPED. AND HOW THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED AND COMPLIED WITH. I WAS FORTUNATE TO LEARN HOW TO DESIGN DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER AND RECYCLED WATER FACILITIES. I HAVE ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF VOLUNTEERING AS A BOARD MEMBER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATION WHERE MY DUTIES INCLUDE PROVIDING TRAINING AND DISSEMINATING INFORMATION.

AT THE YEAR PRIOR TO BECOMING AN APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS A MEMBER OF THE WHITE BOARDS RACIAL EQUITY WORKING GROUP. IN THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO USE MY BACKGROUND AND EXPERIENCE WITH. IN MY ROLE AS A BOARD MEMBER TO LISTEN TO THE PERSPECTIVES AND CONCERNS OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES.

YES WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE I SEE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE WATER BOARD AND IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN AN EASY BOARD TO SURVIVE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONTROVERSY THAT IS DEVELOPED OVER THE YEARS ON SOME OF THE WATER BOARD REGULATIONS THAT HAVE COME DOWN TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. BUT I KNOW THAT TO LISTENING TO YOUR BACKGROUND BOB YOU ARE VERY ENGAGED IN NOT ENSURING THAT WE DO HAVE SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES IN OUR STATE- ONE OF OTHER TO. MEANT TO PROJECT. APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN VERY- BENEFICIAL IN ALL MY DISTRICT DIED THE POLICE TO FIND. THE CELL PLANT IN- CARLSBAD. IN AN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE THE ON. THE GROUND WATER OFFERS IN FACT I THINK ORANGE COUNTY HAS BEEN THE LEADER IN THE USE OF RECYCLED WATER TO REPLENISH OF THE AQUIFER'S. SCHOOL OF MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME KIND OF YOUR IDEA ON THOSE TWO APPROACHES TO WATER SUSTAINABILITY- AND- WHAT YOU SEE. IN TERMS OF THE PROS AND THE CONS THAT DEVELOP OVER THEM AND WHERE YOU FROM WHERE YOU LAND ON THAT CONTINUUM OF BEING IN FAVOR OF- AND IF SO- AND WE'RE NOT IN FAVOR OTHER. YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO WE CAN MAKE THOSE TWO APPROACHES MAY BE. MORE POPULAR KNOWING THAT ISRAEL AT WHAT IS IT 55% OF THE WATER COMES FROM DIESEL PLANTS. SO WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT SOMETHING AS WE LOOK AT THE LONG DROUGHT PERIODS THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH. CERTAINLY THE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING SOME JUST SOME KIND OF ELABORATE ON ON IN THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD BE A VERY HELPFUL TO ME AS I APPROACH SOME OF. THE CONTROVERSY THAT CONTINUES TO EXIST IN MY DISTRICT. YES THEY YOU FOR THAT A LOOK AT EACH AREA- AND- LOOK AT WHAT APPROACH WORKS BEST FOR THAT NOW AREA. AROUND YOUR BOTH LOCALLY- ON AND REGIONALLY THE GOVERNOR HAS ENCOURAGE MANAGEMENT TO DROP AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BASED ON LOCAL CONDITIONERS. WELL CONDITION WHILE THE GOVERNOR EXPANDED THE DROUGHT PROCLAMATION STATEWIDE ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH NUMEROUS COUNTIES HAD ALREADY DECLARED A LOCAL DROUGHT IN SUMMER WATCHES HAVE BEGUN IMPLEMENTING MATH MANDATORY CONSERVATION MEASURES MESSRS. MANY YEARS JUST ASK YOU- JUST PRODUCT DISCUSSED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DOING A GREAT JOB OF DIVERSIFYING MY PORTFOLIO AND SOME WITH SOME ARE REALLY TRULY LEADERS IN THIS AREA FOR EXAMPLE. NEVER MIND- I JUST HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEEKS AGO IT'S REYES- THIS IS A WIDER TO TORRENT OF WATER REPLACEMENT DISTRICTS AT SEVEN CALIFORNIA'S. ROLE SINCE HER FOR WATER RECYCLING AND ENVIRONMENTAL LEARNING THIS PROJECT WAS PART OF THE WIDER ANYTHING IT'S NOW. ALSO KNOWN AS WENT PROGRAM. THREE BROWN LARSON HI. PRIOR TO THE PROJECT UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR DEMAND THE LOCAL STUFF. WAS THE COMPLETE OF THE PROJECT PROVIDE LOCAL. WATER SUPPLY PROGRAM REPLENISHMENT THE MONTH HELP FOR WORKING. IT WAS JUST MANY THERE'S A WHY I'M OF MANY PARTS COMPLETED ON THIS PROGRAM. IT HELPS OUR- TO INCREASE LOCAL THE STATE BUILDING WATER. I'D PART OF THE PROGRAM IS ONE FOR. OF YOUR D. ALONG WITH A BY ANGELES APARTMENT FIRE POWER. WATER IN POWER IN METROPOLITAN WATER OF SAN CAL BURKE CLASS. ON THIS EFFORT TO INCREASE THIS LOCALS WHAT TIME SAID HELLO. AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO AND MODEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT WE CAN BE MORE RECENTLY. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT'S SO YOU KNOW JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURE. YOU ON JANUARY FOURTH THE STATE FOR THE TOP EMERGENCY CONSERVATION REGULATIONS THAT PROHIBIT CERTAIN WASTEFUL WATER USE PRACTICES. THESE ACTIONS ARE LOW COST EASY IS IT WILL BE IN SAME VIRUS AWARENESS. THIS REGULATIONS ONCE I FACT ON JANUARY EIGHTEENTH WE'RE NOW SEEING GROWING RESPONSIBLE WATER SYSTEMS AND HOW LAKE. WATER SYSTEMS ARE SPAMMY TALKING THEIR OWN ORDINANCES ANYWAYS WHY PRACTICES IN THE STATE SAN JUAN MORE. WANT MORE REPORTS WATER RATES IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR EVER RECORDED IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN JANUARY. TWENTY TWENTY COMBINED REGIONAL. ALONG WITH THE INCREASE IN SAVINGS THAT WE SAW IN PEACE ENCOURAGE SIZE OF THE MARKETING REGULATIONS ARE PROMPTING. SHIFT THE MINDSET AWARENESS THAT CAN HELP THE STATE'S ASSESSMENT RESPONSE ONGOING DROUGHT CONDITIONS THIS IS A GOVERNOR'S CALL. WHEN THE STATE'S ABOUT AMERICA'S WATER USED. BY FIFTEEN THE SACRED ONE PM TO SAVINGS OF SEVEN POINT 4% DECEMBER WHEN THE STATE WIDE SERVING SAVINGS ALSO REACHED SIXTEEN POINT 2% THE STATE BOARD HAVE PLAN TO PRESENT ENOUGH YOUNGER WATER CONSERVATION DURING HIS FIRST MARCH FIRST BOARD MEETING OUR BECAUSE OUR WATER SUPPLIES HAD INTEL FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH TO REPORT THURSDAY HAS. A COMPLETE DATASET WAS NOT YET AVAILABLE RATHER THAN RELEASING PROVISIONAL DATA THAT WE STAND NEEDS TO BE REVISED WE WILL BE SHARING THE JANUARY AT THEIR NEXT REGULARLY. SCHEDULED BOARD MEETING ON MARCH FIFTEENTH. I MUSTN'T HOW CAN DO REMAIN VERY. HE IS STILL CRITICAL FOR. ALL DO WHAT THEY CAN TO SAVE WATER ESPECIALLY OUTDOORS. I DO UNDERSTAND THAT REGULATIONS ARE NEEDED CERTAINLY ON THE CONSERVATION SIDE THAT I THINK INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE THESE PROJECTS THAT WE KNOW- DO WORK- DIESEL AND JOB GROUNDWATER REPLENISHMENT VERY IMPORTANT VERY EXPENSIVE. SO I THINK THE INCENTIVE CAN COME FROM THE WATER BOARD GETTING BEHIND THOSE WITH A LITTLE MORE POSITIVE STATEMENT AND ALSO SUPPORTING OUR FUNDING WOULD WE HAVE I THINK ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR WATER RESILIENCY AND- THAT MANY I THINK CALL IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE INCENTIVIZE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO ARE. CONSIDERING ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES ON BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE OF.

I KNOW THAT YOU WERE GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH ME THAT I BROUGHT UP REGARDING THE DISTRICT. I'LL SAVE THAT FOR A PHONE CALL. BET AND- AS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK DOWN AT TALK ABOUT WHICH WE DID TALK ABOUT IN THAT. IN OUR CONVERSATION IS THAT. YOU KNOW GIVEN THE DROUGHT IN THE CUTBACKS WITH THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN OUR FARMERS AND GROWERS. YOU KNOW I AM LIKE I SAID I'M A BIG PICTURE PERCENT AND- MY COLLEAGUE THE FORMER SECRETARIES RT ROLLING HIS EYES AT ME. BUT M. ARE YOU. AYE HE IS. HE IS ROLLING HIS EYES AT ME BUT HE'S SO I'M- YOU KNOW I'M VERY CONCERNED YOU KNOW- I TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS WE WERE ON THE PHONE THERE ARE SEVERAL PRODUCTS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT WE GROW ONLY IN THE CENTER VALLEY AND THEY'RE- AROUND THE GLOBE. THEY DO NOT GO ANYWHERE ELSE. THINGS THAT ALL OF US ON THIS DIET CENTER CONSTITUENTS EAT EVERY DAY. ALMONDS ALMOND FLOUR. AND KIWIS QUARTERBACK CARROTS AND ALMONDS WALNUTS PISTACHIOS. I BELIEVE THERE'S A HUNDRED TWENTY COMMODITIES I WON'T NAME THEM ALL. AND BUT WE GROW IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND WITHOUT WATER WE OBVIOUSLY CAN'T GROW THAT.

THE TOP THREE FOOD PRODUCING COUNTIES IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. OUR. FRESNO KERN AND TULARE COUNTY. THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED ADVOCACY IN THIS AREA.

CONCERNED ABOUT THE FOOT SUPPLY CHAINS LET'S JUST SAY WE DO GET YOU KNOW FOOD FROM VENEZUELA- YOU KNOW HOW'S IT GONNA GET HERE ESPECIALLY WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES THAT WE HAVE I THINK GROWING FOOD SAFELY HERE IS THE BEST THING BUT THAT'S THE AREA THAT I REPRESENT BUT- EVEN IF I WAS IN THE- LOVELY CITY OF LOS ANGELES OR IN SAN DIEGO THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER I WOULD STILL WANT OUR FOOD. GROWN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THOSE TYPES OF SUPPLY CHAINISSUES AND OTHERS IF WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT- I HATE THAT WATER IS I HATED EVERYTHING IS VERY POLITICAL BUT I REALLY HATE THAT WATER IS POLITICAL. THERE IS A TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN BIOLOGICAL OPINION BY A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION THAT OPINION IS NOW AND IN THE FRESNO CORD TO LAWSUITS BEEN FILED INTO AND IT DEALS WITH OUTFLOWS SEEN THAT THE NEW BIOLOGICAL OPINION WITH NEW SCIENCE SHOWS THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE SO MUCH OUT FLOWS TO PROTECT SALMON AND- SOLIDITY FROM COMING INTO THE BAY AREA WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT.

I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED SALMON AND YOU KNOW THERE'S NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- OR IT NEEDS TO. BE THERE FOR THE PURPOSES OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S A VAST NEED FOR WATER- THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE A PROP- THERE WAS A PROPOSITION THAT WAS THE BALLOT MEASURE THAT WAS PASSED PROP ONE SB ONE I BELIEVE. IT WAS A BALLOT MEASURE THAT ADDRESSED A WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. THAT WE HAD A COMMITTEE HEARING YESTERDAY IT WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME TO LEARN A FEW FACTS AND I WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON IT. AND SO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPROVED A BALLOT MEASURE TO FIND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. IN YOUR OPINION CAN YOU CHANGE. WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VOTED ON TO FEND AND DIRECT IT TO SOMETHING ELSE OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE FUNDED AND- THE WAY THE PROPOSITION WAS RIPPED WRITTEN AND IF YOU. IF YOU NEED TO GET BACK TO ME ON THAT I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AS WELL. YOU KNOW Z. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE CAN- SO I. BURKE BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT WAS PROVIDED TO ME. THANKS TO THE STATE WATER BOARD AND JUST BE INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING THOSE FINES- YEAH WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE TIMES AND WE NEED TO READ WHAT IS PUT INTO YOU KNOW IT'S A LOT AND WE RAISE THOSE IN AND WE DID ALSO PREPARE- YOUR BY LINE'S. THIS IS HOW YEAH HERE'S WHAT WE READ THAT IS LAW HERE'S WHAT OUR GUIDELINE IT WOULD TAKE US TO THE BOARD- AND- THEN. THE FOURTH QUARTER YEAH PUBLIC COMMENTS AND SAYING.

OF HAVING YOUR CONFIRMATION HEARING TODAY AFTER WE HAD THIS OTHER HERE. THE ED AND PRIVATE WE ARE THE OF THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD BY HAD EXCHANGE WHERE SHE LET ME KNOW THAT. THAT YOU JUST COULDN'T HAVE VEGETABLES SALMON WITHOUT VEGETABLES AND I SAID YOU COULDN'T HAVE VEGETABLES WITHOUT SALMON SO WE WERE. GOING BACK AND FORTH IN A WONDERFUL WIFE. AND JUST FOR THE RECORD I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN CHANGE THE TWO POINT SEVEN. BILLION DOLLARS FOR STORAGE I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE VOTERS DID. I THINK IT'S LOCKED IN AND- UP- AND I'M SORRY THAT IT'S EVEN COMING UP. FOR DISCUSSION. I THINK THAT THE IT PART OF THE DIFFICULTY IN THE HEARING OR HAVING IS THAT- WERE QUIZZING YOU. ABOUT A LOT OF ITEMS THAT THAT ACTUALLY FALL IN THE PURVIEW OF THE AGENCY I ONCE HAD OUR BECAUSE- WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WATER SUPPLY AND EVEN FISH AND WILDLIFE TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES TO THE FLOWS. AND THE WATER MORE TAKES WHAT COMES FROM THAT. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE AN ABOUT YOUR OPENNESS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S THE OPENNESS TO DEAL WITH THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE THE IMPORTANT THING. FOR GOING FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT THE MOST OF MARK. ASKED DIFFERENT QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK IN PARTICULAR. SENATOR COM LONGER ARE ASKED ABOUT ENGINEERING AND- WE SHOULD JUST NOTE THAT THIS IS A SEAT. THAT IS HELD FOR CIVIL ENGINEER AND THEY ARE VERY HARD TO FIND OF THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT RECRUITMENT THING SO THE FACT THAT YOU. ARE HERE IS A GREAT THING AND A TRIBUTE TO YOUR QUALIFICATIONS AND YOUR BACKGROUND AND THAT WAS EXPLORED WITH YOU THERE. IN THE END THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A QUESTION ABOUT MOVING THE PROCESS EXPEDITIOUSLY WHICH I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT. SO LET ME JUST TEST THE LAST ONE THAT I'M SURPRISED NOBODY'S ASKED ABOUT YET BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED ABOUT TWO OR THREE TIMES. PETITIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE RACIAL EQUITY WORKING GROUP SO WHAT IS THAT MEANT BECAUSE I KNOW THEY'RE BEEN CRITICISMS OF DIVERSITY AT THE WATER BOARD. ABOUT HOW IF YOU DROP DOWN ON THAT AS A PART OF THAT GROUP. I'M SURE SO YEAH SO YEAH WHEN I PARTICIPATE WITH EARLY STAGES AND IT WAS BEING ON A CALL.

AND THE SPECIFIC ISSUES TO EACH GEOGRAPHICAL REGION BUT HOW IT ALL FITS TOGETHER SO WE TALK ABOUT WATER CURTAILMENT IN THE DELTA FOR INSTANCE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE REST OF THE STATE WHEN SAN DIEGO WHICH I AM PROUD TO SAY IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO THAT HELPS AS WELL BUT- WITH THE DROUGHT- YOU KNOW I THINK I TAKE ALL OF OUR POSITIVE ACTIONS HAS. REALLY BEEN TESTED AND SO I THINK THE CHARGE AND CHALLENGE FOR THE BOARD IS TO FIGURE OUT ANY ACTIONS IT'LL HELP MITIGATE ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THINGS LIKE AGRICULTURE AND OTHER USERS- SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PROBABLY ANYTIME SOMEONE COMES BEFORE US FOR THE WATER BOARD I THINK WE'RE GOING TO ENGAGE THIS CONVERSATION- BECAUSE IT IS SO CRITICAL TO ALL OF US.
