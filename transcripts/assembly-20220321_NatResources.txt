I FIRST WANT TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS ON RECENT AMENDMENT SPECIFICALLY PAGE BROKAW. UNDER CURRENT LAW WHEN THERE'S A THREAT OF LEAKAGE OF OIL COMING FROM A VESSEL THAT VESSEL MUST IMMEDIATELY REPORT THAT DISCHARGE CAL OH YES SHOCKINGLY HOWEVER IF A VESSEL WERE TO BE CALLED THE BECAUSE OF THE OIL LEAKAGE SUCH AS HITTING A PIPELINE WITH ITS ANCHOR LIKE WE WITNESSED AN ORANGE COUNTY LAST OCTOBER. THERE IS NO LAW MANDATING THEY MUST NOTIFY ANYONE AB SIXTEEN ELEVEN IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO MERELY PUT INTO PLACE PROTOCOLS FOR A VESSEL OPERATOR TO NOTIFY CAL OH YES ABOUT A STRIKER POTENTIAL STRIKE OF A SUBMERGED PIPELINE THE BILL WOULD ALSO INSTRUCT THE OFFICE TO NOTIFY THE PIPELINE OPERATORS SO THEY MADE BEGIN REPAIRS ON THE PIPELINE. IMMEDIATELY THE BILL WOULD ALSO STATE THAT VESSEL OPERATORS WHO KNOWINGLY DOES NOT PROVIDE THIS ALERTED CAL ALWAYS. FULLY US IS SUBJECT TO A CIVIL FINE OF UP TO ONE MILLION DOLLARS. I WANT TO SPECIFIED THAT THIS AMOUNT IS ALREADY CURRENT LAW. GOVERNMENT CODE EIGHT SIX SEVEN ZERO POINT SIX FOUR IN AB SIXTEEN ELEVEN NEARLY COPIES ITS EXISTING PENALTIES GAME DEVELOPED BY AB. THIRTY TWO FOURTEEN BY THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LAMONT I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE CIVIL PENALTY ONLY GOES INTO EFFECT IF THE OPERATOR DOES NOT REPORT THE STRIKE TO. CAL YES IF THEY FOLLOW THE PROTOCOLS PUT IN PLACE BY THE BILL THE PENALTY DOES NOT COME INTO EFFECT. MEMBERS HASN'T BEEN REPORTED THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS ORANGE COUNTY SUFFERED LAST YEAR AS A RESULT OF AN ANCHOR STRIKE TO A PIPELINE. HAS WELL EXCEEDED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. TOURISM IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AND MANY LOCAL ATTRACTIONS AND TOURIST SPOTS WERE CLOSED FOR GREAT PERIODS OF TIME BUT CLEAN UP EFFORTS WERE UNDER WAY. HAD A NOTIFICATION MEASURES SUCH AS AB SIXTEEN ELEVEN BEEN PLACED WHEN THE PIPELINE WAS STRUCK IN JANUARY THE STATE COULD HAVE INVESTIGATED AND NECESSARY REPAIRS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY TEAM IN THE BILL STAKEHOLDERS IMPROVING THIS BILL. REALLY APPRECIATE THE COOPERATION. MY TEAM IS. BEEN IN ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ALSO WITH CAL RECYCLE TO FINE TUNE THE BILL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS TO EXPAND THE BILL'S ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE COLLECTION PROGRAMS FOR BIOMASS RECYCLING INCLUDING COMPOSTING AND MULCHING. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK SENATOR NIELSEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GALLAGHER AND PATTERSON FOR CO AUTHORING THE MEASURE AS WELL. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX WOULD CREATE A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM FOR RURAL COUNTIES. TO OFFER COLLECTION DAYS FOR THE REMOVAL OF LOCALIZED ACCESS WOODY BIOMASS MATERIAL. THE BILL PROVIDES OPTIONS FOR ROLE RESIDENTS TO DISPOSE OF THEIR EXCESS BIOMASS MATERIALS. WE INTEND TO USE THE GIGI R. F. FUNDS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM IS THERE'S A CLEAR NEXUS BETWEEN THE PILOT PROGRAM AND A MEASURABLE REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THE CURRENT PROBLEM EACH YEAR ROLE CALIFORNIANS TAKE THEIR OVERGROWTH AND PILE IT UP AND BURNING. MANY RESORT TO THIS METHOD OF DISPOSAL SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO OTHER WASTE TO REMOVE THE MATERIAL FROM ONCE PROPERTY. THIS IS BOTH A FIRE RISK IN ENVIRONMENTALLY DAMAGING OF WILDFIRES. INCREASED FREQUENCY OF SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE LAST DECADE SADLY IT ONLY TAKES ONE CARELESS NEIGHBOR IN THEIR BURN PILE TO POTENTIALLY CAUSE A DISASTER THIS BILL ALLOWS FOR THE SAFE REMOVAL OF. WOOD AND TO BREEZE. THIS BILL IS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY BIOMASS IS A CLEAR ALTERNATIVE TO OPEN PILE BURNING RESULTING IN FAR FEWER EMISSIONS WHILE ALSO GENERATING ENERGY FOR THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES. THIS BILL IS A COMMONSENSE SOLUTION. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW COUNTIES TO HOLD WHILE MASS COLLECTION DAY SO THAT LOCAL RESIDENTS CAN DROP OFF THEIR BIOMASS MATERIAL FREE OF CHARGE. SIMPLY PUT AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX PROVIDE A SAFE OPTION FOR ROLE CALIFORNIANS TO KEEP THEIR PROPERTIES CLEAR OF FIRE FUELS WHILE ALSO REDUCING OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IN CLOSING. WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND AGAIN ARE HAPPY TO TAKE. THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS.

AS AMENDED AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX WILL HELP RESIDENTS IN SMALLER RURAL COUNTIES MANAGE DIFFERENT ORGANIC WASTE STREAMS MANY OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES ARE IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS THOSE AREAS THERE SHOULD TREMENDOUS NEED FOR FOREST HEALTH IMPROVEMENT VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROJECTS. TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX WILL HELP GET THOSE MATERIALS OUT OF THE FORCE TO BIOMASS FACILITY AND AVOID SIGNIFICANT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OPEN BURNING OR NATURAL DECOMPOSITION THE POOREST. AT THE SAME TIME NOT ALL COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO BY MESSAGE SO IT'S SO BY EXTENDING THE GRANT PROGRAM TO COMPOST AND MULCH PRODUCTION THE BILL ALSO HELP THOSE JURISDICTIONS MANAGE ORGANIC WASTE. AND FINALLY AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX COULD HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S NEW SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING REGULATIONS THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE DIVERSION OF ORGANIC WASTE FROM LANDFILLS WE APPRECIATE MR MATHIS BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND- URGE YOUR ABILITY IN APPROPRIATE TIME.

AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY EIGHT WILL PLUG IN THESE TWO FOUNDATIONAL GAPS IN THE STATE'S FLEDGLING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS GROWING THREAT. AND AT ITS COULD NOT CONTROL ARE POINTING OUT BOTH OF THESE CORRECT AND THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT YEAH COMMITTEE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WHO OF COURSE. FIRST AB TWENTY TO THIRTY WILL INCREASE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE SEVERITY OF THE RISK BY IMPROVING WARNING SYSTEM. CURRENT WARNING SYSTEMS DO NOT FULLY ACCOUNT FOR EACH RISK HUMAN HEALTH AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY EIGHT FOUR SIX THIS WEEK OUTCOMES INTO A NEW SYSTEM.

CATEGORIZATION ALLOWS FOR BETTER DISASTER PREPAREDNESS HIGHER IMPACT PUBLIC MESSAGING THAT IS TARGETED AT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IMPROVES EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC SPENDING AND ULTIMATELY SAVE LIVES.

AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AN ANALYSIS PREPARED FOR THE OUR TRUCK CENTER ESTIMATES THAT EACH YEAR PETER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN LOST WORKER PRODUCTIVITY ALONE.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL I A M. SAID ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTION AMENDMENT ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS THAT CORRECTS A DRAFTING ERROR. GLOBALLY THE E. COMMERCE INDUSTRY USES ALMOST THREE BILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING- AND THAT WAS JUST IN TWENTY TWENTY AND OF THAT E. COMMERCE BUSINESSES IN THE U. S. GENERATED SIX HUNDRED MILLION POUNDS OF PLASTIC PACKAGING WASTE AND THAT IS PURE WASTE THAT'S NOT USED BY ANYBODY FOR ANY REASON EXCEPT TO RECEIVE THE SHIPMENT OF BY CONSUMER GOODS. LAST YEAR CONSUMERS SPENT EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS ONLINE WITH U. S. MERCHANTS BUT WAS UP 44% OVER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH ALMOST A THIRD OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION NOW BUYING ONLINE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING GENERATED IS ESTIMATED TO MORE THAN DOUBLE BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX. THE STAGGERING GROWTH EXCEEDED TO OUTLAST THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IS CREATING AN UNSUSTAINABLE WAVE OF SINGLE USE PACKAGES AND PACKAGING. ALMOST ALL OF WHICH IS HEADED DIRECTLY TO A LANDFILL OR TO INCINERATION OR OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT POLLUTES OUR WATER WAYS AND PRODUCED POLLUTES OUR LANDS AL LIKE MANY OF YOU I ALSO BUY THINGS ONLINE SOMETIMES AND I AM ALWAYS APPALLED AT THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING THAT COMES WITH SOME PRODUCTS. NOW SOME RETAIL SERVER RETAILERS HAVE GOTTEN A LOT BETTER AND I'VE SEEN MANY OF THEM STARTING TO ELIMINATE PLASTIC PACKAGING ALTOGETHER BUT MANY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN THE MEMO AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF BUYING SOMETHING THAT'S NOT FRAGILE NOT BREAKABLE BUT YET HAS COME WITH THE WAVES OF PLASTIC. FILM WHICH IS NOT JUST NOT RECYCLABLE BY MY CITY BUT WHICH CONSTANTLY CLOGS UP THEIR MACHINERY. SO THIS LEADS TO OVERFLOWING TRASH BINS WHICH IS TAKEN TO LANDFILLS AND MANY OF YOU LIKE ME COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING FOR THAT ARE NOT JUST THOSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUT THE RATE PAYERS EVEN IF YOU DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING ONLINE AT ALL. YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAYING MORE FOR YOUR TRASH BECAUSE OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE BECAUSE OF ALL OF THAT NON RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. FILLING UP YOUR LANDFILL CLOSING YOUR LANDFILL BEING HAULED WITH DIESEL GARBAGE TRUCKS FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. FOR NOTHING NOW WE KNOW THAT IT'S FOR NOTHING AND WE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER BECAUSE THERE ARE PERFECTLY GOOD ALTERNATIVES TO SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING ALREADY EXISTING ALREADY BEING IMPLEMENTED HERE AND ELSEWHERE. IN FACT INNOVATIVE PACKAGING START UPS LIKE LIME LOOP AND MUSHROOM PACKAGING ARE BASED. OR ACTIVE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS HOME GROWN INDUSTRIES. AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX WILL REDUCE THE UNNECESSARY AND UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC USE AN E. COMMERCE MARKETPLACE. IT WILL SPUR THIS INDUSTRY IT WILL SPUR THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IT WILL ALSO STOP PENALIZING THE GOOD ACTORS. AND MAKING THEM BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE BAD ACTORS IT'S GONNA PUT EVERYONE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SO THAT ALL OF. THE ALL THESE COMPANIES HAVE TO ACT MORE RESPONSIBLY SPECIFICALLY AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX WILL REQUIRE A SHIFT TO NON PLASTIC PLASTIC PACKAGING THAT IS RECYCLABLE. COMPOSTABLE OR REUSABLE AN ACCEPTABLE IN CURBSIDE BINS. AND EXTEND THE SUNSET ON EGGS UNDER EXISTING REQUIREMENT THAT ESTABLISHES THE- THAT PROVIDES CARRY OUT AND DURABLE PLASTIC BAGS PROVIDE A COLLECTION BIN FOR THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING AND RECYCLING THOSE BAGS. AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX WILL REDUCE THE MANY HARMFUL IMPACTS OF UNNECESSARY SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING BY PHASING OUT THE USE OF MOST SINGLE USE PLASTIC FILMS AND EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE E-COMMERCE PACKAGING FOR ONLINE RETAIL PURCHASES. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON ARE ACTUALLY TRIGGER PACIFIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER WITH OCEANIA AND CHEN M. SHRIMP THE STATE DIRECTOR OF CAL **** AND I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION. I WOULD REQUEST AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN- WE'RE READY FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OPERATOR Q. PLEASE OPEN UP THE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IT WAS HERE WHAT MAKES. PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS ACTUALLY LIKE A TRIGGER AND I AM THE PACIFIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS MANAGER FOR THE OCEAN CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION OCEANA ON BEHALF OF OUR MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OCEAN IS PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF UNNECESSARY SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING USED FOR SHIPMENT SENT DIRECTLY TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FROM ONLINE RETAIL PURCHASES. OR E-COMMERCE THE PUBLIC SUPPORT EFFORTS LIKE EIGHTY TWENTY TWENTY SIX YOU PUBLIC POLLING RELEASED LAST MONTH FINDS THAT REDUCE THE USE OF PLASTIC PACKAGING FROM ONLINE SHOPPING AND A SURVEY CONDUCTED LAST SUMMER REVEALED THAT 71% OF THE AMAZON CUSTOMERS IN THE U. S. WOULD USE PLASTIC FREE ALTERNATE PACKAGING OFFERED THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT PRACTICAL ALTERNATIVES TO SINGLE USE PLASTIC FILM AND POLYSTYRENE PACKAGING ARE AVAILABLE. IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY AMAZON INDIA ANNOUNCED THEY HAD ACHIEVED A 1100% SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION AWAY FROM SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING LESS THAN A YEAR AFTER THEIR DECLARATION TO ACT ACCORDING TO NEW RECENT NEWS ACCOUNTS AMAZON PLANS TO ELIMINATE SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING IN GERMANY. ONE OF THE COMPANY'S LARGEST MARKET. COMMERCE PRIOR AND CURRENT ACTIONS TO ADDRESS IT SINGLE PLASTICS. DEMONSTRATES WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN PLASTIC REDUCTION IS A PRIORITY. ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE U. S. MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE ALTERNATIVES TO PLASTIC CUSHIONING AND VOID FILL THAT PROTECTED DURING SHIPMENT AND THOSE ALTERNATIVES CAN AND SHOULD BE USED MORE WIDELY. CALIFORNIA MUSTELIDAE AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX COMES AS SALES IN THE E. COMMERCE MARKETPLACE HAVE SKYROCKETED. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE COUNTRY IN ONLINE SHOPPING. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS THAT ENSURE PACKAGES SENT IN AND INTO THE STATE ARE PACKAGED AS THE SIMPLY. AND RESPONSIBLY AS POSSIBLE. AS A NEW MOTHER AND THE CALIFORNIANS I FEEL STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RESPONSIBILITY TO TACKLE THIS PRESSING ISSUE. WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR LEAVING I THANK YOU A FAMILY MEMBER STONE FOR CO AUTHORING AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WE URGE AND I ABOUT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JAN EXTREM AND I AM THE STATE DIRECTOR FOR CALPERS. WERE A CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE AND STUDENT CHAPTERS AT THE UC. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX ALONG WITH THE SHANNON ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA. WRITTEN LEGISLATION WILL HELP ADDRESS THE GLOBAL PLASTICS CRISIS BY PHASING OUT THE UNNECESSARY AND UNACCEPTABLE AMOUNT OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. USED TO SHIP ONLINE PURCHASES AND INTO CALIFORNIA. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT TWO DUMP TRUCKS WORTH OF PLASTIC AND UP IN OUR ENVIRONMENT EVERY MINUTE. BOTH CLASSIC DOES NOT GO AWAY INSTEAD IT BREAKS UP INO SMALLER PIECES. THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE. READ GOOD IN THE OCEAN AND HARMING WILDLIFE. MICROPLASTICS AND EVEN FOUND INSIDE OUR OWN FOOD AND BEVERAGES POTENTIALLY EXPOSING AT THE HAZARDOUS COMPOUNDS AND ADDITIVES. BUT THE PACKAGING ADDED TO ONLINE PURCHASES DURING SHIPMENT INCLUDING CLASSIC MAILING ENVELOPES- PILLOWS BUBBLE WRAP AND EXPANDED POLYSTYRENE ARE A SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CRISIS. ALL OF THE PLASTIC PACKAGING THE DISCARDED IMMEDIATELY AFTER PACKAGES OPENED AND IS EITHER REUSED OR RECYCLED. DYSPLASTIC INSTEAD BECOME PLAN FILLED BURNED OR ENTERED OUR ENVIRONMENT WORKING PROCESS OF THE PUTTING FOR GENERATIONS. ACTUALLY WITH THE GROWTH OF ONLINE SHOPPING WE KNOW CONSUMERS WANT ALTERNATIVE PACKAGING THAT DOESN'T POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OR COFFEE RESOURCES CLEAN UP. AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN PORTLAND OREGON BELT AIMED AT ADDRESSING THE PROBLEMATIC WASTE STREAMS AND WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR HER LEADERSHIP ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE FOR CO AUTHORING AND HER DRIVER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE UP TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING. ON THE PHONE OVER THE PHONE. OF FIRST IS ADAM REGULARLY FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE- ARE YOU HERE IN PERSON OKAY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AT A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWENTY SIX. I WANT TO BEGIN BY STATING THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DOES NOT DISAGREE THAT SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING OR- PACKAGED IN GENERAL THAT REACHES THE ENVIRONMENT IS A POLLUTION THAT. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. CALCHAMBER AND ITS MEMBER COMPANIES- CANDOLI WORK VERY DILIGENTLY TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE AND RECYCLE OUR PRODUCTS- IN OUR PACKAGING I THINK THE QUESTION THAT WE REALLY FACE TODAY IS WHETHER BANNING PACKAGING THAT SERVES A CRITICAL FUNCTION FOR SHIPPING TRULY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF GOODS THROUGH THE- CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AS AS THE AUTHORS INDICATED. IS A GROWING SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY SO WE DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT- BUT CANDIDLY IF WE SIMPLY JUST BAN THIS PACKAGING THERE ARE UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES AND CERTAINLY ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENT. AND IT IS WHY CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. REALLY LOOK AT THE ISSUE OF. SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING AS HOW DO WE ACHIEVE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA THAT CREATES AND MARKETS UP PUTS THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATION ON THE PRODUCERS TO PAY FOR A MORE ROBUST RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH- FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA EXPORTED ITS- ITS MATERIALS ABROAD AND NOW WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE MANAGE OUR OWN- MATERIALS. HOW DO WE CREATE THOSE AND MARKETS AND STORES REDUCE SUPERFLUOUS PACKAGING SO WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT THERE IS EXCESS PACKAGING THAT CAN BE REDUCED WE ALL AGREE IT IN INCENTIVIZING AND CREATING FINANCIAL MECHANISMS TO PENALIZE IF YOU DO NOT. BECOME MORE EFFICIENT. AND ALL OF THESE IDEAS HAVE BEEN PUT FORTH. IN NOT ONLY DISCUSSIONS LAST YEAR BUT THIS YEAR AND A BROADER CIRCULAR ECONOMY DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING ON CURRENTLY SO WE FIND THAT A BAND BILL ON PACKAGING WHICH- NO DISRESPECT THE AUTHOR BUT THERE ARE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A LOT OF THE PACKAGING FOR SOME OF THESE SECTORS WHICH ARE NOT EXEMPTED ON THIS BILL. AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES IF YOUR TELEVISION YOUR REFRIGERATORS YOUR COMPUTER MONITORS ALL THE WHICH RELIES ON EPS TO COME FROM SOUTHEAST ASIA IN THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE BREAKS OR IS RETURNED BY CUSTOMER THERE ARE MASSIVE GHG EMISSION. IMPACTS FOR SENDING THESE PRODUCTS BACK TO THEIR HOUSE ORIGIN- THERE IS MASSIVE ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS TO RE MAKING THESE PRODUCTS THERE'S MASSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THE LANDFILL IN THE ACTUAL PRODUCT AND TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE EPS IS ZERO POINT 5% OF THE CALIFORNIA WASTE STREAM SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BANNING. EPS WE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN CONTEXT TO HOW BIG THE WASTE STREAM IS AND WHAT PRODUCTS- THE PROTECTING FROM DAMAGE BREAKAGE ETCETERA AND SO WE COMMIT TO WORKING ON A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WITH THE PROPOSAL THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER AND BUSINESS. COMMUNITIES BUT FORD IS THE FIRST IN THE NATION THAT ACTUALLY EXCEEDS ALL OTHER CIRCULAR ECONOMY PROPOSALS OUT THERE WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THAT BUT WE MUST OPPOSE- ARBITRARY BAN ON MATERIALS WITH. CANDIDLY DATES THAT WE DON'T SEE A REALISTIC OR GROUNDED IN ANY SORT OF- I GUESS REALITY OR I WOULD SAY THE TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY SO- WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THE EPS INSIGHT SO OUR MANUFACTURERS ALSO IN A SIMILAR VEIN USED FILM TO PROTECT ITS PLACE CREAM STIRRING SHIPMENT AND IT WOULD ALSO BE BANNED THE BILL. SO THE PACKAGING MATERIALS ARE IMPACTED THE HOME AND THEY'RE NOT FOUND IMMEASURABLE AMOUNT ANYWHERE IN THE OUT OUTDOOR ENVIRONMENT- SO INCREASED BREAKAGE RATES FOR TELEVISIONS AND MONITORS AND OTHER LARGER COMPLEX PRODUCTS WOULD CREATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAT FAR OUTWEIGH ANY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIMARY PACKAGING NOT JUST IN TERMS OF MATERIALS OF MASS BUT ALSO AS WITH MENTIONED EARLIER AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS IMPACTS.

NOT ONLY IS THE INCINERATOR ONE OF THE LARGEST STATIONARY SOURCES OF AIR POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GASES IN STANISLAUS COUNTY IT ALSO INCENTIVIZES THE CREATION OF MORE TRASH AND DISINCENTIVE EYES IS MORE SUSTAINABLE LOCAL WASTE PRACTICES FOR EXAMPLE MODESTO HAS NO RESIDENTIAL CURBSIDE RECYCLING SERVICE DESPITE HAVING ONE OF THE FIRST ONES IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE THE INCINERATOR WAS BUILT. MOST RECYCLABLE MATERIAL THAT IS THROWN AWAY MODESTO IS BURNED AT THE INCINERATOR IN ADDITION OVER A HUNDRED CITIES SEND WASTE TO BE BURNED AT THE INCINERATOR EVERY YEAR OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD NOT BE A DUMPING GROUND FOR THE STATE INCINERATION IS NOT RECYCLING AND IT IS NOT THE VERSION AND IT IS HINDERING CALIFORNIA'S VISION OF BEING A MODEL ZERO EMISSIONS AND ZERO WAIT STATE OF THE FUTURE.

FIRST NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MISTER WHAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- MISTER SEA I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF THE TRANSFORMATION FACILITIES PIECES OF THE BILL HOWEVER I AM CONCERNED ABOUT A PROVISION IN SECTION THREE OF THE BILL. THAT WOULD GIVE CAO RECYCLE SIGNIFICANT NEW AUTHORITY OVER JURISDICTIONS THEY NEED TO DEVELOP A NEW WASTE FACILITY INCLUDING A NEW LANDFILL. I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE ARE WASTED DIVERSION WASTE AND REDUCTIONDIVERSION GOALS I SAT ON THE- ON- WASTE MANAGEMENT AGENCY FOR SEVERAL YEARS WHEN I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER- BUT WILDFIRES ARE TAKING A TOLL ON ON. ON THESE- FACILITIES BECAUSE WE CAN'T RECYCLE THAT AND FOR EACH HOUSE. THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF WASTE THAT HAS TO BE DISPOSED OF. AND NOW WE'RE POTENTIALLY GOING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR JURISDICTIONS TO SITE AND IT'S ALREADY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT A NEW A NEW LANDFILL SOMEWHERE SO I I'LL SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I HOPE YOU WORK ON NARROWING THAT. THAT PIECE OF THE LANGUAGE IN IN. IN IN IN A KNOWLEDGE MENT OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE ALREADY FACE AN INSIDE IN A LANDFILL. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP- IN IN THE SPACE. BOTH AND- THE WASTE MANAGEMENT BUT ALSO WITH THE WILDFIRES OUT THERE. IN IN SOME INSPECTORATE DOES MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT- I THINK MICHAEL AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN THAT ENSURE WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OTHER. MEANS OF REDUCING WASTE BEFORE WE ARE PERMITTED A NEW LANDFILL AND IF THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THAT. I'M DEFINITELY OPEN TO THAT I DO THINK WE COULD ACHIEVE BOTH AND SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WILL FOLLOW UP. CAN I JUST POINT OUT WHEN THERE'S A WHEN THERE'S A WILDFIRE IN THEIR HOUSES INVOLVED- THE WASTE HAULERS COULD THE HOLLERS COME IN AND THEY THEY'VE THEY'VE LITERALLY WRAP IT UP IT'S LIKE A BIG BURRITO FOR LACK OF A- BATES PLASTIC AROUND IT. THAT'S TOXIC IT'S BIG IT'S NOT RECYCLABLE THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD YOU CAN RECYCLE THAT NOBODY EVEN REALLY KNOWS WHAT'S IN THERE. AND THAT IS FILLING UP LANDFILLS ALL OVER NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND- AND OTHER PROBABLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS WELL. SO WE HAVE TO COME TO GRIPS WITH THAT REALITY. BUT I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT. HOW DIFFICULT IT ALREADY IS TO CITE- LANDFILL- AND NOW. GIVING ANOTHER AT AN AGENCY MORE AUTHORITY. TO POTENTIALLY MAKE THAT MORE DIFFICULT AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE THIS OUT THERE- AND THAT'S THAT'S HUGE PROBLEM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AND I APPRECIATE IT I'VE ACTUALLY VISITED ONE OF THE LANDFILLS THAT'S ANOTHER CALIFORNIA IT'S TAKING. US SOME OF THIS. DEBRIS OUT THERE. AS WELL AND SO I DO BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A WAY- WHEN APPROPRIATE FOR US TO LOOK AT. SOURCE REDUCTION AND WHEN AN APPROPRIATE TO CARVE THAT OUT ON AND THIS IS A WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CASEIN NINE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TWEETERS AND RC RC IN IN THEIR OPPOSITION- AS WELL I THINK THAT THERE'S- SOME AMENDMENTS COMING THAT CAN START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF NOT ALL OF THEM AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL.
