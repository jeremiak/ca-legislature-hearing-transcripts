00:48:01.878 --> 00:48:02.679
IF WE'RE NOT LOOKING TOWARD

00:48:02.746 --> 00:48:05.549
CHINA AS A PLACE FOR SOLUTIONS

00:48:05.616 --> 00:48:07.050
TO OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.418
WOULD BE LOOKING IN THE WRONG

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.821

OF THE SOLUTION- IN CHINA AS AN

00:48:15.158 --> 00:48:15.959

IS PART OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE.

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.878

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:36.446
CLIMATE WORKING CONTINUE

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:39.182
WITHOUT THIS LEGISLATION. AND

00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:40.183
AND I STRUGGLE WITH THIS

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:41.818
LEGISLATION NOT BECAUSE OF THE

00:48:41.885 --> 00:48:44.688
THREAT THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS-

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.923
CONFRONTS US WITH. BUT BECAUSE

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:52.062
OF OTHER ISSUES HAPPENING

00:48:52.129 --> 00:48:52.629
INSIDE CHINA'S BORDERS RIGHT

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:57.934
NOW. THAT CANNOT GO UNNOTICED

00:48:58.001 --> 00:49:00.737
THAT WE KNOW ABOUT. THAT WE ARE

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:03.173
ALL AWARE OF THAT SECRETARY OF

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.742
STATE TONY BLINKEN REFERRED TO

AS GENOCIDE JUST THIS WEEK- IN

00:49:08.445 --> 00:49:10.447
REFERENCE TO CHINA'S TREATMENTS

00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:13.517
OF THE UIGHUR MUSLIMS. SO WE

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:15.919
CAN'T JUST ACT LIKE EVERYTHING

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:18.088
IS NORMAL WHEN WE ARE ENGAGING

00:49:18.155 --> 00:49:20.424
WITH CHINA EVEN ON EXISTENTIAL

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:24.261
THREATS. WHEN WE KNOW. THAT

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:27.130
REALLY BAD THINGS ARE HAPPENING

00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:31.535
INSIDE CHINA. AND I THINK ABOUT

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:34.304
WHAT WOULD OCCUR DURING A

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.406
DIFFERENT VERY CHALLENGING TIME

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.541
FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ON OUR

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:40.310
PLANET. DURING THE GLOBAL

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:41.745
DEPRESSION DURING THE GREAT

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:46.083
DEPRESSION OF THE THIRTIES. IF

00:49:46.149 --> 00:49:47.984
CALIFORNIA OR THE UNITED STATES

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:50.787
OR OTHER. ANOTHER MIGHTY

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:54.091
ECONOMIC POWER THOUGHT. GERMANY

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:57.894
IS THE LINCHPIN OF GETTING

00:49:57.961 --> 00:49:59.329
HUMANITY OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:02.165
CRISIS. IMAGINE THIS BEING POST

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.767
KRISTALLNACHT MAYBE PRE DEATH

00:50:03.834 --> 00:50:08.138
COUNT TERMINATE. AND WE SAID WE

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:10.273
CAN PULL THE WHOLE GLOBE OUT OF

00:50:10.340 --> 00:50:12.743
THIS. SO LET'S HAVE STRONGER

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.778
PARTNERSHIPS WITH GERMANY. WELL

00:50:14.845 --> 00:50:17.514
WE KNEW THAT INTERMENT CAMPS

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.115
CONCENTRATION CAMPS WERE GOING

00:50:18.181 --> 00:50:21.585
ON. WHICH THEY PROBABLY DID.

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:24.888
BUT PEOPLE WENT ALONG. AND NO

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.723
ONE IN A DISTANT CAPITAL-

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.358
THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE MIGHTY

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:32.429
ARE POWERFUL. NEVER RECONCILED

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.797
THAT THIS IS GOING ON INSIDE

00:50:33.864 --> 00:50:35.632
THAT COUNTRY INSIDE GERMANY

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.000
IMAGINE WHAT THAT WOULD HAVE

00:50:37.067 --> 00:50:41.171
BEEN LIKE. IT PROBABLY HAPPENED.

00:50:41.238 --> 00:50:44.341
SO HERE WE ARE A CENTURY LATER.

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:47.244
AND WE KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING.

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.980
WE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.815
FIFTH MIGHTIEST ECONOMIC POWER

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:52.949
IN THE WORLD WE LIKE TO CALL

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:04.628
THEIR FAITH. PLACED IN CAMPS.

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:08.331

00:51:08.398 --> 00:51:11.334
IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL. AND

00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.637
CODIFY PARTNERSHIP THAT'S JUST

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:15.372
ALREADY TAKING PLACE ANYWAY.

00:51:15.439 --> 00:51:21.244
WITHOUT RECOGNITION. THAT THIS

00:51:21.311 --> 00:51:23.413
IS HAPPENING TO MILLIONS OF OUR

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.616

WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE

01:00:57.987 --> 01:00:59.889
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A MADE BY

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:01.791
THE INSTITUTE BECAUSE

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:03.793
CALIFORNIA IS ALL ALWAYS AT THE

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.694
FOREFRONT WHEN IT COMES TO

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.529
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE WANT TO

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.765
CONTINUE THAT LEADERSHIP. AND

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.400
TO- MY COLLEAGUE FROM US IN

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:19.809
PART OF THE SOLUTION AND I

01:01:19.876 --> 01:01:24.580
TOTALLY AGREE WITH. THAT AND I

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:26.282
THINK THAT- IN CALIFORNIA HAS

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.750
TO BUILD. A PUNISH. WITH

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.018
EVERYBODY WHO COULD REDUCE THIS.

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:31.054
OF YOU KNOW THIS IS SUCH A- NOW

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.755
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU ALSO.

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:35.124
I WAS BORN IN HONG KONG AND-

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.526
YOU KNOW YOU ALL KNOW WHAT'S

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:37.994
BEEN HAPPENING IN HONG KONG.

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.629
ALSO DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF THE

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:41.030
ISSUES THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING.

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:41.931
BUT I'D YOU KNOW WANTED TO

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:43.900
ISOLATE. MYSELF FROM A LOT OF

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.735
THE ISSUES THAT I CANNOT

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.136
CONTROL. BUT YET. I WANTED TO

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:48.337
FOCUS ON SOMETHING THAT I COULD

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:49.972
CONTROL. AND I THINK THIS IS

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:51.174
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.576
DEFINITELY FOCUS IN ON. AND I

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.710
THINK THE GOVERNOR MENTIONED

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.145
FACT THAT CHINA IS A BIG

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:59.215
EMITTER. OF- CLOUT THESE ARE

01:01:59.282 --> 01:02:00.883

YEAR ALONE IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:12.862
WERE AT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION.

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:15.431
AND YES I THINK. IT IS IN THE

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:17.467
BEST INTEREST OF BOTH PARTIES

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:23.673

CALIFORNIA BAN ON SCHOLARSHIP

DISPLACEMENT. WHICH WOULD

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.199
INCREASE ACCESS TO HIGHER

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.367
EDUCATION BY PREVENTING

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.135
COLLEGES FROM REDUCING

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:14.737
FINANCIAL AID AWARDS IF A

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:16.605
STUDENT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PELL

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.074
GRANTS FOR THE CALIFORNIA DREAM

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:20.743
ACT IS ALSO AWARDED A PRIVATE

01:06:20.810 --> 01:06:22.411
SCHOLARSHIP. WE ALL KNOW THIS

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:25.581
MANY PARTICULAR THAT A DEGREE

01:06:25.648 --> 01:06:26.649
AS EXPENSIVE. AND STUDENTS

01:06:26.716 --> 01:06:28.351
STRUGGLE EVERY DAY TO MAKE ENDS

01:06:28.417 --> 01:06:30.186
MEET. EVEN WITH STUDENT DEBT

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.387
AWARDS MANY STILL HAVE

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:32.988
FINANCIAL NEED AND WORK

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.191
EXTREMELY HARD TO EARN OUTSIDE

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:37.626
SCHOLARSHIPS. IN SOME CASES

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:38.894
STUDENTS ARE UNABLE TO MAKE

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:40.096
FULL USE OF AWARDS GIVEN BY

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.664
PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:43.199
BECAUSE COLLEGES CAN REDUCE

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:44.533
THEIR FINANCIAL AID. WHICH

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.068
THOSE STUDENTS WOULD OTHERWISE

BE QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE. THIS

01:06:47.937 --> 01:06:49.472
COMMON PRACTICE OF REDUCING

01:06:49.538 --> 01:06:51.040
FINANCIAL AID AWARDS DUE TO THE

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:52.241
RECEIPT OF PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS

01:06:52.308 --> 01:06:54.910
IS REFERRED TO. AS SCHOLARSHIP

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:58.214
pSTRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.449
DREAMS WE MUST NOT PUNISH THOSE

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.251
WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

01:07:02.318 --> 01:07:04.353
RECEIVE A PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.521
SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:06.589
CREATES AN EVEN GREATER

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.090
FINANCIAL BURDEN ON STUDENTS

01:07:08.157 --> 01:07:09.892
FROM LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHO

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.093
MAY NOT HAVE OTHER MEANS TO

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.295
PAY. FOR NON TUITION COSTS OF

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.731
COLLEGE BOOKS FOOD HOUSING

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:18.033
TRANSPORTATION. THE REAL COST

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.402
OF ATTENDING COLLEGE IS MUCH

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:21.303
MORE THAN THE TUITION AND FEES.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.506
AND IT TENDS TO BE MUCH HIGHER

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.240
THAN TYPICAL FINANCIAL AID

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:26.842
AWARDS. A SMALL SCHOLARSHIP

01:07:26.909 --> 01:07:28.377
MEANS THE BIG DIFFERENCE. KEEP

01:07:28.444 --> 01:07:30.146
STUDENTS ON TRACK TO GRADUATE

01:07:30.212 --> 01:07:32.248
INSTANCE INSTEAD OF BEING

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.416
FORCED TO DROP OUT. HEARING

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:36.051
SCHOLARSHIP. IS IMPORTANT. IN

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:39.455
ANY EQUITY FOCUSED COLLEGE

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.723
ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF COVER

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.425
NINETEEN. AS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE

01:07:42.491 --> 01:07:43.959
RESOURCES ARE BECOMING EVEN

01:07:44.026 --> 01:07:45.795
MORE LIMITED FOR STUDENTS. THIS

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:46.929
BILL WOULD BRING US ONE STEP

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:48.731
CLOSER TO EQUITY ON OUR COLLEGE

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.733

NOT A SITUATION THAT ANY OF OUR

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:03.385
YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD BE AND. AND

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:03.986
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:04.653
THAT FRONT. THAT I'M INSTEAD IS.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.587
I WAS LOOKING AT THE BILL I WAS

01:17:05.654 --> 01:17:08.357
TRYING TO. UNDERSTAND IS. IS

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:09.324
THE PRACTICAL IMPACT OF THIS

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.492
BILL GOING TO BE THAT IT

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:12.627
CONCENTRATES RESOURCES. IN THE

01:17:12.694 --> 01:17:13.862
HANDS OF A- SMALL NUMBER

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:15.197
STUDENTS RATHER THAN SPENDING

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:17.032
THEM OUT MORE BROADLY. AND IS

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:19.034
THAT GOING TO IMPACT. IN SOME

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.002
WAYS OUR MOST VULNERABLE

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:21.370
STUDENTS I ASSUME THAT OF THOSE

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:23.605
RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID- THAT.

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.174
THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE- FROM

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:27.676
THE- FROM THE MOST DIFFICULT

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.211
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE GOING TO BE

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:30.278
LEAST LIKELY TO BE ABLE TO

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.314
ACCESS- PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP

01:17:32.381 --> 01:17:33.482
THEY MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT.

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.150
AND SO- YOU KNOW THIS THIS IS

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:36.385
YOUR SCHOLARSHIP DISPLACEMENT

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:37.185
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD BE

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:39.021
EXTRAORDINARILY CHALLENGING.

01:17:39.087 --> 01:17:40.222
AND WORRISOME FOR STUDENTS HAVE

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:41.156
BEEN PRIVILEGED TO RECEIVE

01:17:41.223 --> 01:17:42.557
MULTIPLE SCHOLARSHIPS BUT IF WE

01:17:42.624 --> 01:17:44.259
CONCENTRATE. RESOURCES AND

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.627
THEIR HANDS ARE WE LIMITING THE

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:46.428
NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:47.496
GOING TO GET FINANCIAL AID AND

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.564
THEN PERHAPS. INADVERTENTLY

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.933
CLOSING THE DOORS. OF HIGHER

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.301
EDUCATION TO SOME OF OUR MOST

01:17:53.368 --> 01:17:55.737
VULNERABLE STUDENTS AND- YOU

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:56.705
KNOW I DON'T KNOW I IN AND-

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.640
POTENTIALLY IS. IF I GUESS WHAT

01:17:58.707 --> 01:17:59.775
I'M HOPING TO HEAR FROM FROM

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.643
FOLKS WHO SUPPORT THE SPELL-

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.578
IS. YOU KNOW ARE WE TAKING THAT

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.180
DISCRETION AWAY FROM FROM

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:06.048
FINANCIAL AID OFFICERS

01:18:06.114 --> 01:18:07.416
UNIVERSITIES YOU MIGHT LOOK AT

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.250
THIS AND SAY WELL THE STUDENT

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.751
HAS RECEIVED. A NUMBER OF

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:11.453
PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS. NOT

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:12.587
EVERYTHING I HOPE BUT IT'S

01:18:12.654 --> 01:18:13.188
ENOUGH TO GET THEM IN HERE AND

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:14.656
I'D LIKE TO SHIFT SOME OF THAT

01:18:14.723 --> 01:18:16.658
LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:17.959
TO ANOTHER STUDENT WHO WON'T BE

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.027
ABLE TO ATTEND THIS UNIVERSITY

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.695
WITHOUT THOSE RESOURCES SO. I'M

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.064
NOT SURE WHAT THE- WHAT THE

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:22.998
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS I'M

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:23.932
PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:25.300
TODAY BECAUSE THE OFFER IS NOT

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:25.801
HERE AND I THINK IT'S AN

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.436
IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THAT.

01:18:27.502 --> 01:18:29.271
THAT DESERVES TO CONTINUE- BUT

01:18:29.337 --> 01:18:30.672
EITHER. TODAY FROM SOME OF THE

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:32.040
WITNESSES OR OR PERHAPS A THE

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:32.908
FUTURE CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:18:32.974 --> 01:18:35.043
AUTHOR- FOR MY GREAT RESPECT I

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:36.978
I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT- ARE

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.747
WE INADVERTENTLY. GOING TO BE

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:39.748
SENDING SOME OF OUR MOST

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.116
VULNERABLE STUDENTS. OUT OF

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:42.684
HIGHER ED. BY CONCENTRATING

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:46.788
RESOURCES. IN THE HANDS OF

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.590
ELECTED YEAH. THANK YOU MR

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:50.025
GABRIEL ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS

01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:52.928
DOES. RESEARCH IF YOU WANT TO

01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.563
OKAY FINE I'LL GIVE A PARTIAL

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.698
ANSWER TO THIS SO- FIRST OF ALL

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.500
IN ONE THANKS COMMITTEE STAFFER

01:18:58.567 --> 01:18:59.701
POINTED OUT THE FINANCIAL AID

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.503
OFFICERS DO NOT TAKE A POSITION

01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.371
ON THIS BILL NOR THE EXPRESS

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:04.940
THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN AND I

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:05.807
KNOW THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF

01:19:05.874 --> 01:19:07.843
THE AUTHOR. AND HE'S OPEN TO

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:08.710
THIS CONVERSATION ONE THING

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:11.246
I'LL THE SEMI OWN BEHALF IS

01:19:11.313 --> 01:19:13.648
THIS PRACTICE HAS CREATED A

01:19:13.715 --> 01:19:16.151
VIRTUALLY DAY DISINCENTIVE FOR

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.819
PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:19.754
BECAUSE IT. BASICALLY SENDS A

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.823
SIGNAL THAT IF THEY'RE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.959
CONTRIBUTE THEIR DOLLARS THAT-

01:19:24.025 --> 01:19:26.094
THAT THEIR DOLLARS WILL BE USED

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:27.863
TO BACKFILL INSTITUTIONAL EIGHT

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:29.664
SO FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THE

01:19:29.731 --> 01:19:31.933
QUESTION IS WHY WOULD I GIVE MR

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.835
GABRIEL A SCHOLARSHIP IF THAT'S

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:35.337
GONNA TAKE AWAY SOMETHING ELSE

01:19:35.403 --> 01:19:36.138
HE'S DOING SO WE WANT TO MAKE

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:38.406
SURE. THAT WE ARE PROPERLY AND

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:39.407
SENDING THOSE PRIVATE

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.308
SCHOLARSHIP PROVIDERS TO DO

01:19:40.375 --> 01:19:41.843
WHAT THEY DO- BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.245
I'VE LITERALLY JUST STEPPED IN

01:19:43.311 --> 01:19:47.349
TEN MINUTES AGO SO I'M SURE

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:47.983
THERE ARE OTHER PERSPECTIVES ON

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:48.483
THIS AS WELL. ANY OTHER

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:49.384
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:53.855
COMMITTEE. MISTER MEDINA I

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:55.724
PLEDGE MISTER WITH THAT THANK

01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:59.327
YOU- AND AGAIN I UNDERSTAND

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:01.796
THAT THE MR BONTA IS NOT HERE

01:20:01.863 --> 01:20:03.398
TODAY I DID HAVE THE SAME

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:06.268
CONCERNS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:10.172
GABRIEL- OF THE BUT ALSO. I

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.941
HAVE BEEN MEMBER OF A NUMBER OF

01:20:13.008 --> 01:20:14.376
CLUBS THAT HAVE OFFERED THE

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:17.879
SMALL SCHOLARSHIPS AND- TO

01:20:17.946 --> 01:20:20.382
STUDENTS AND THERE WAS ALWAYS A

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:23.084
CONCERN. OR OR THERE WAS A REAL

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:25.187
INTEREST IN WRITING THE CHECKS

01:20:25.253 --> 01:20:28.657
TO THE INSTITUTION FOR TUITION

01:20:28.723 --> 01:20:31.393
AND SO MY CONCERN WOULD BE IF

01:20:31.459 --> 01:20:32.961
CALIFORNIA NOW STEPS IN AND

01:20:33.028 --> 01:20:34.329
SAYS NO YOU HAVE TO WRITE THE

01:20:34.396 --> 01:20:36.765
CHECK TO THE STUDENT BECAUSE

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:38.567
THE TUITION IS ALREADY BEING

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:40.335
COVERED BY THE SCHOOL. I'M

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.870
CONCERNED THAT YOU MIGHT LOSE A

01:20:41.937 --> 01:20:43.838
LOT OF- SMALL SCHOLARSHIP SO

01:20:43.905 --> 01:20:47.275
HAS HAS THAT- BEEN CONSIDERED

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:49.911
OR DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER

01:20:49.978 --> 01:20:56.651
IT'S BEEN CONSIDERED OR NOT.

01:20:56.718 --> 01:21:00.655
MOST DEMOCRATS. WHICH VERSION

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:02.457
SHOULD GIVE I ACTUALLY DON'T

01:21:02.524 --> 01:21:03.391
KNOW THE ANSWER THEM JUST

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:04.659
CONFIRM WITH COMMITTEE STAFF

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:05.860
AND YOU KNOW WHAT AT NIGHT I

01:21:05.927 --> 01:21:07.028
WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT

01:21:07.095 --> 01:21:09.030
I THINK THAT SOME OF THESE

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:10.432
DETAILS NEED TO BE WORKED OUT

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:11.600
YOU DON'T WANT IT AND THEN

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:13.368
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT A

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.036
LOT OF THESE SMALL PRIVATE

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:20.475
SCHOLARSHIP- THAT- THAT A LOT.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:21.276
THE SMALL PRIVATE SCHOLARSHIPS

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:24.212
END UP DISAPPEARING BECAUSE OF

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:24.813
SOMETHING THAT WE DID HERE AT

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:27.215
THE LEGISLATURE. AGAIN I'D

01:21:27.282 --> 01:21:35.957
APPRECIATE THAT WELL. TWO TWO.

01:21:36.024 --> 01:21:37.592
I APOLOGIZE I CAN ACTUALLY NOT

01:21:37.659 --> 01:21:38.860
ABLE TO RESIST- BUT BUT I'LL

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.095
JUST I'LL JUST SAY AGAIN THAT

01:21:40.161 --> 01:21:42.163
<u>T THIS MOMENT THERE IS A</u>

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.965
STRANGE DISINCENTIVE TO THOSE

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:45.300
CULTURE PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.434
KNOW THAT THEY PROVIDE A

01:21:46.501 --> 01:21:48.270
SCHOLARSHIP TO YOU- THAT THAT

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:50.038
WILL END UP NOT INCREASING THE

01:21:50.105 --> 01:21:51.072
AMOUNT OF HELP THAT THE STUDENT

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:54.442
GETS- BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT-

01:21:54.509 --> 01:21:56.444
THAT THAT- THE OFFERING

01:21:56.511 --> 01:21:57.545
