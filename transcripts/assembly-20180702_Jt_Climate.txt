THE JOINT COMMITTEE ON CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES SENATE COMMITTEE ON ENERGY UTILITIES AND COMMUNICATIONS ALONG WITH THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES. ENERGY. THAT WELCOMES YOU AND CHAIRS WILL SAY A FEW WORDS AS WE GET STARTED. THE AGENDAS ARE AT THE BACK AND THAT WILL JUMP RIGHT IN. A THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY FOUR EIGHT THREE COMMITTEE INFORMATION HEARING ON THE CARPET EYES IN OUR ELECTRIC GRID. ELECTED THANK US THERE WAS SOME STAFF OF COURSE IS THAT COMMITTEE STAFF ALONG WITH. CHAIRMAN HOLDEN IN HIS TEAM FOR BRINGING THIS OUR CONVERSATION TOGETHER. TODAY'S CONVERSATION COMES AT A VERY TIMELY MOMENT STATE CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY. STRONG GAINS ON RD CARBONIZATION EFFORTS THERE ARE STILL MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR OUR LECTURE GRID. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THAT WERE NOT TO HEAR TO HEAR ANY BILLS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS -- TOO OFTEN. IN FACT -- WE DON'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THIS ENVIRONMENT -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE LARGER ISSUES THAT WILL HELP INFORM. OUR LEGISLATIVE WORK I'M MOVING FORWARD. AT WE REACH A CRITICAL MOMENT WAS SOLUTIONS MUST BE NEGOTIATED VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS WHY I'M GLAD THAT THE TEACHERS WERE STANDING ENERGY POLICY COMMITTEES AGREE TO JOIN US FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT. DISCUSSION. THIS HEARING PROVIDES MEMBERS THE CHANCE TO HEAR THE FROM AGENCIES STAKEHOLDERS AND UTILITIES. ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR GREAT TO CARBONIZATION EFFORTS AND WHERE THERE'S ROOM FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OR INNOVATION. LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL TO JOIN US AT THE TABLE AND TURN THE MIKE OVER TO MY FELLOW A COLLEAGUE IN AND CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY TOADIES ENERGY. THANK YOU -- CHAIR GARCIA AYE IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT. CONVERSATION AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED -- AND IT COMES IN A YEAR WHEN OF THERE IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF FOCUS AND ENERGY. OF NO PUN INTENDED BUT FOCUSED AND IN THE INDUSTRY AND HOW CAN LOOK TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND ON ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE GOALS THAT WERE SAID HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE CERTAINLY THIS IS THAT A STATE THAT HAS TAKEN THE LEAD. IN REDUCING JC EMISSIONS AND RIGHT OF WAYS -- THAT IS SETTING THE STANDARD FOR NOT ONLY OTHER STATES. TO EMULATE BUT AROUND THE WORLD AND SO AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE ALL OF THE VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST HERE. I'M I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND TO JOIN THE AND AS WE ADDRESS MANY IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST BUT CERTAINLY -- AS WE HAVE OUR ESTEEMED GUESTS TO BE HERE TOO LYNN THEIR INCITING CREDIBILITY TO THIS TOPIC. I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE AND JOIN IN ON THE ON THE DISCUSSION. THE COLLEAGUES AND COME MUCH FORGET STARTED THANK YOU ALRIGHT DOT PANEL IS MADE UP OF THE AND RANDOLPH THE FROM THE CPU SEE. MARK ROTH OF THAT NATURE. FROM THE GOVERNMENT -- SYSTEM OPERATOR AND RICHARD CORY WITH THE A RESEARCH SUPPORT IN THE GOOD AFTERNOON LIANE RHONDA FROM THE C. P. C.. WE ARE AT THE BRIDGE OF TWO WORLDS. ONE IN WHICH FALSO FEELS ARE PRIMARY SOURCES OF ENERGY. A CREATING MYRIAD THREATS TO OUR HEALTH AND RISK TO OUR LONG TERM WELFARE AND ANOTHER PARADIGM IN WHICH THE BULK OF OUR ENERGY INCREASINGLY COMES FROM EMISSION FREE RENEWABLE RESOURCES COUPLED WITH ENERGY STORAGE. AS YOU KNOW THIS SHIFT IS FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN JUST SWAPPING OUT OLD TECHNOLOGIES WITH NEWER ONES. AND SO I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT HOW THE CPC IS MEETING THESE OPPORTUNITIES. AND CHALLENGES. WITH THE INTERMITTENCY OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES INSURING THAT THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGIES ARE ON THE GRID. TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IS CRITICAL. AND WE EACH YEAR MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE BECOMING ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS AS GENERATORS AS WELL AS CONSUMERS OF ENERGY. OUR ENERGY RESOURCES ARE BECOMING MORE DECENTRALIZED AND MORE DIVERSE. AND OUR ELECTRIC AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS ARE BECOMING INEXTRICABLY LINKED. OUR ROLE AT THE CPC IS TO GUIDE RESOURCE IMPLANT RESOURCE PLANNING ACQUISITION FOR BOTH THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM. BY LOOKING AT BOTH THE SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM WE CAN MAXIMIZE RENEWABLE GROWTH. REQUIRE CONTRACTS FOR SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. NO IS RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO PROVIDE STABLE PRICES FOR RATEPAYERS PROTECTING US FROM THE VOLATILITY THAT BECAUSE THE ENERGY CRISIS. OUR LONG TERM PLANNING PROCESS IS THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE IS PLANTING PROCEEDING. MANDATED BY S. B.. THREE FIFTY WHICH MOVES US AWAY FROM INDIVIDUAL RESOURCE PROCUREMENT MANDATES AND ESTABLISHES A GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGET. THAT LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. UTILITIES CCA'S AND ENERGY SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL PLAN TOWARDS. THE I RP DECISION ADOPTED EARLIER THIS YEAR ESTABLISH AS A TWO YEAR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING CYCLE. TO MOVE TOWARDS THE HARMONIZING THE GRID. THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CYCLE IS DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PLANNING TARGET FOR THE ELECTRIC SECTOR. AND IDENTIFY THE OPTIMAL MIX OF STABLE A SYSTEM WIDE RESOURCES CAPABLE OF MEETING THAT TARGET. WE ADOPTED A STATEWIDE ELECTRIC SECTOR GHG PLANNING TARGET OF FORTY TWO MILLION METRIC TONS BY. TWENTY THIRTY WHICH REPRESENTS A EMISSIONS FROM TWENTY FIFTEEN LEVELS AND A 61% REDUCTION FROM NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. HAVE TO ARRIVE AT THIS EMISSIONS TARGET WE MODELED A RANGE OF EMISSIONS THAT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD CLIMATES COULD CHANGE COPING PLAN ESTIMATED THAT THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WILL ADMIT IN. TWENTY THIRTY THE SECOND YEAR OF THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING CYCLE IS DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE SUITE OF ACTIONS LOAD SERVING ENTITIES PROPOSE. TAKE TO MEET THAT TARGET. IT IS DURING THE SECOND YEAR AFTER WE RECEIVE INTEGRATED RESOURCES PLANS FROM EACH LOAD SERVING ENTITY. THAT THE COMMISSION WILL CONSIDER AUTHORIZING ENTITIES TO PROCURE RESOURCES IN THE NEAR TERM TO MEET THEIR PLANNING TARGETS. SO WHAT ARE THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES REQUIRED PLAN TOWARDS. IN OUR DECISION WE ADOPTED A REFERENCE SYSTEM PORTFOLIO FOR THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES IN THE CASE OF BOUNCING AUTHORITY. TO ARRIVE AT THAT PORTFOLIO WE MODELED A WIDE RANGE OF ASSUMPTIONS TO IDENTIFY WHAT TYPES AND QUANTITIES OF NEW RESOURCES ARE NEEDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. TO MEET THE TARGET. THE ADOPTED PORTFOLIO INCLUDES TEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW SUPPLY SIDE RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW BATTERY STORAGE BY TWENTY THIRTY ON TOP OF EXISTING STORAGE MANDATES. WHEN LOW SERVING ENTITIES FILE THEIR HIGHER PEAS THEY MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE SCENARIO A FUTURE RESOURCES AND PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES THAT -- CONFORM TO THIS PORTFOLIO. BUT THEY ARE ALSO ALLOWED TO SUBMIT ALTERNATIVE PORTFOLIOS. TO ALLOW THEM FLEXIBILITY TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES. IF JUSTIFIED BASED ON NEW INFORMATION LOCAL CONDITIONS AND LOCAL PREFERENCE. THE POLICIES WILL BE FILING THEIR PLANS ON AUGUST FIRST OF THIS YEAR. ON THEY MUST PROPOSES I MENTION HOW TO MEET THE TARGET AND ADDRESSED EXPECTED IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES I AM. ANY LOAD CERVANTES PROPOSING TO DEVELOP NEW NATURAL GAS RESOURCES OR TO RE CONTRACT WITH EXISTING ATTRIBUTE GAS RESOURCES. FOR PERIODS LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS MUST MAKE A SHOWING EXPLAINING WHY LOWER UNITY OR ZERO A MEETING RESOURCES WERE NOT SELECTED. NOW TURN TO SHORT TERM. RESOURCES WE ADDRESS THOSE AS A MENTION IN OUR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ENERGY CRISIS AND DIRECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE THE PURPOSE IS TO REQUIRE ENTITIES THAT SERVE ELECTRICAL LOAD TO DEMONSTRATE THEY HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCE CAPACITY. THE INSTANTANEOUS POWER NEEDED INTO EVEN IN TIMES OF HIGHEST DEMAND IN LARGE SCALE OUTAGES. TO SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS FOR ANYWHERE FROM ONE MONTHS TO A YEAR. PLANTS THAT HAVE CAPACITY CONTRACTS MAY NOT RUN VERY FREQUENTLY SOMETIMES JUST A FEW HOURS A YEAR. BUT THEY NEED TO BE READY POISED TO OPERATE IF CALLED UPON. OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS RESOURCE ADEQUACY HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. BUT AS A CALIFORNIA INCREASINGLY DEVELOPS ITS DIVERSE ENERGY PORTFOLIO. IT PRESENTS CHALLENGES. OVER THE YEARS AND WITH THE INVESTMENTS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF REPAIR DOLLARS THE CPC HAS MANAGED RESOURCE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO BRING NEW ENERGY RESOURCES TO MARKET READINESS. WE ARE HOME TO LEADING EDGE ENERGY STORAGE FACILITIES SOLAR PRODUCTION THAT OUT DOES THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. WINDOW RESOURCES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE STATE. THE FIRST EVER MARKET BASED DEMAND RESPONSE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS FUNCTIONING ALONGSIDE NUCLEAR HYDRO POWER IN NATURAL GAS. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS ARE SMALLER LOAD SERVING ENTITIES HAVE BEGAN REPORTING THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING INSUFFICIENT RESPONSES TO THEIR REQUESTS FOR OFFERS TO BUY RESOURCE ADEQUACY CAPACITY. THIS IS MAGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A PROLIFERATION OF THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF ENTITIES THAT ARE PROCURING ELECTRICITY FOR CUSTOMERS. FOR INSTANCE WHERE FIVE COMMUNITY CHOICE ENTITIES EXISTED IN DECEMBER. TWENTY SIXTEEN ONE YEAR LATER TWENTY ONE COMMUNITY CHOICE ENTITIES WERE OPERATING OR PLANNING TO OPERATE IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEY NOW SERVE A COMBINED 15% OF THE LOAD UNDER OUR JURISDICTION. AS A RESULT LAST MONTH. THE COMMISSION MADE TWO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY PROGRAM. FIRST LOAD SERVING ENTITIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO A THREE TO FIVE YEAR CAPACITY REQUIREMENT IN LOCAL AREAS. WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT EXTENSION OF THEIR PRESENT OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION WE ASK OUR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES TO PROPOSE A CENTRAL BUYER STRUCTURE FOR CAPACITY IN LOCAL AREAS. THE CENTRAL FIRE STRUCTURE IS A HISTORICALLY PROVEN APPROACH. THAT WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS LOAD MIGRATION AND COST. SHIFTING ISSUES WHILE ENSURING COORDINATED AND COST EFFECTIVE CHAIRMAN. WE THINK THESE POLICY MOVES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE'VE SEEN AS THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTING. TO PROCURE THEIR RESOURCE ADEQUACY OBLIGATIONS. BUT ULTIMATELY IF WE'RE GONNA MEET OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS IN THE LONG TERM. WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR RELIANCE ON THE FAUCET FLEET. BEING SUCCESSFUL IN THAT TASK IS GOING TO REQUIRE A BROAD SUITE OF SOLUTIONS. INCLUDING ADDING MORE UTILITY SCALE SOLAR TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NEW GRID CAN TECHNOLOGIES LIKE SMART INVERTERS. COORDINATING OUR TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGIES TO MAKE SURE THOSE STRATEGIES BENEFIT THE GRID. AND ACCESSING A WIDE VARIETY OF RENEWABLES FROM OUT OF STATE INCLUDING THROUGH REGIONALIZATION. I WILL NOTE THAT IN THE EXAMPLE OF THE UTILITY SCALE SOLAR AND I'M SORRY UTILITIES KILL STORAGE -- THE COMMISSION RECENTLY ORDERED -- PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC TO PURSUE SOME ALTERNATIVES TO SOME GAS FIRED GENERATION TO MEET A LOCALLY CONSTRAINED AREA NEED. AND THEY HAVE FILED AN APPLICATION PROPOSING SEVERAL STORAGE PROJECTS -- AND SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF ASSERTIVE TAKING A LOOK AT THAT. A LOCALLY CONSTRAINED AREA AND AND ASKING -- FOR SOME DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS -- AND THOSE SOLUTIONS. HAVE HAVE COME FORWARD SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES WHEN IT WAS MARK PROFITER REMOVED FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR -- THE ISO'S A NON FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT OPERATES THE GRID INTO IN MOST OF ABOUT 8% OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE FOR REGULATED ORGANIZATION -- AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR EFFECTIVELY MAINTAINING RELIABILITY BY BOUNCING SUPPLY AND DEMAND ENSURING INSURING THE SYSTEM IS OPERATED SECURELY. WELL ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION IS OPERATING UNDER EITHER AN I SO OR REGIONAL TRANSMISSION ORGANIZATION SIMILAR TO THE CALIFORNIA AYE SO. IN THE WEST WE REALLY AT IS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WERE THE ONLY -- INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR OPERATING IN IN THE WEST AT THIS POINT. WE ENSURE SECURE RELIABLE TRANSPARENT DISPATCH -- BOTH DAY AHEAD AND REAL TIME AND WE MINIMIZE ACOSTA SERVING LOW TO CALIFORNIA. BY ENSURING THAT WE ARE MINIMIZING THE COST OF FUEL. ALSO CONSIDERING THE GHG COSTS OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES AS WELL AS EXTERNAL RESOURCES SERVING LOAD IN CALIFORNIA. AS COMMISSION AROUND OFF INDICATED THE CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY ENTITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECURING SUFFICIENT RESOURCE CAPACITY -- EXISTS CONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES. IT'S NOT THE CALIFORNIA SO AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT. THE PROCUREMENT RESPONSIBILITY IS THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE NOT UNDER FEDERAL REGULATION. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- THEY RESOURCE ADEQUACY PLANS ARE DEVELOPED AND THE I SO HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THOSE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN OPERATE FROM THEM RELIABLY. ALSO IN THE LONG TERM INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN. THAT THE CQC THE I SO MONITOR AND PERFORMS A DAY ANALYSIS. AGAIN TECHNICAL REVIEW TO ENSURE OPERABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. WITH REGARD TO CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES THE ISO SUPPORTS THESE CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES IN SEVERAL WAYS. FIRST WE'VE INCORPORATED AS I DESCRIBED GHG COMPLIANCE COSTS INTO THE DISPATCH SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY WITH REGARDS -- TO THE AMOUNT OF GHG EMISSIONS IT TAKES TO OPERATE THE GRID. IN FACT WE'VE OBSERVED ABOUT A ASSOCIATE WITH DISPATCH IN CALIFORNIA SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN WE PROVIDE FORECASTING AND PLANNING AS WELL AS ANALYTICS AND SOME OF THE ANALYTICS THAT WE PROVIDE -- ARE USED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IN THEY'RE GONNA GET HER ENERGY POLICY REPORT. AS WELL AS THE CPUC INNER INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN. LASTLY A IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PERFORMED SPECIFIC STUDIES RELATED TO S. B. -- THREE FIFTY THAT ANALYZED AND LOOKED AT THE POTENTIALS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONALIZATION. LAST YEAR WE BEGAN PUBLISHING ENHANCE GHG TRACKING INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE AND I'VE GOT SOME ADDITIONAL MATERIAL IF YOU. TO SHARE WITH YOU IF YOU LIKE. THIS INFORMATION PROVIDES SOURCES AND TRANS OF THE GHG EMISSIONS BY GENERATION TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION A CRY PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE EMISSIONS INTENSITY TRAMS. BOTH ON A REAL TIME SCALE AS WELL AS ANNUAL AND MONTHLY TRENDS. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE I SO IMPLEMENTED THE WESTERN ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET. WHICH HAS GROWN TO OPTIMIZE DISPATCH IN REAL TIME OF RESOURCES ACROSS EIGHT STATES PLUS BRITISH OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET SINCE ITS INCEPTION HAS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IN ADDITION THROUGH THE MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF CALIFORNIA CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DISPLACE OTHER EXTERNAL HIGHER COST THE MIDI RESOURCES EXTERNALLY WHEN THERE'S AN ACCESS OR SURPLUS OF SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND IN REAL RESULT IN DISPLACEMENT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND METRIC TONS OF GHG AND THE REST OF THE WEST. THIS IS ALL BECAUSE THE THE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET CONSIDERS A SOURCE SPECIFIC NOT AN UNSPECIFIED -- DISPATCH AND CONSIDERATION OF GHG ON A RESOURCE SPECIFIC BASIS FOR EXTERNAL RESOURCES SERVING LOADING CALIFORNIA. WE'VE LEARNED ALONG THE WAY THROUGH THEN AND YOU BOUNCE MARKET THAT THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO BETTER. ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING CURRENTLY COLLABORATING WITH. WITH -- IS THE G. EIGHT XIFAXAN SOURCES. ASSOCIATE WITH SECONDARY DISPATCH AFFECTS AND WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP AND ENHANCED POLICY RELATED TO TRACKING OF THESE AND REDUCING THE SECONDARY DISPATCH A FAX. WE'RE PREPARED TO TAKE OF THIS POLICY TO OUR BOARD IN THE NEXT -- MONTH OR SO WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTING. THE CHANGES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. OPPORTUNITIES EXIST IF THE I SO WERE TO FURTHER -- TO OPTIMIZES DISPATCH OVER LARGER REGIONAL AREA. WE CAN CONTINUE TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCURACY OF EXTERNAL RESOURCES IN THE SOURCES OF GHG. WE CAN INCREASE THE VALUE OF CLEAN RESOURCES IN THE TH AND THE FLEET OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED AND INCLUDING USING THESE RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY. FOR ESSENTIAL RELIABILITY SERVICES THUS REDUCING RELIANCE ON OMITTING RESOURCES THAT PROVIDE THIS CAPABILITY. TO LASTLY I JUST WANT TO POINT TO THE SOME OF THE S. B. FIFTH THREE FIFTY RESULTS THAT INDICATE. THAT WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AROUND AND AS WELL AS RECEIVE REDUCTIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY ACROSS THE WEST USING A REGIONAL. A DISPATCH AND LASTLY WEALSO OBSERVE FROM THE STUDIES THAT. IN MOST OF THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY AREAS WE CAN SEE ACTUAL REDUCTIONS OF LOCAL -- LOCAL. EMISSIONS AS WELL IT IN ADDITION TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO WE LOOK FOR TO ANY QUESTIONS AND ELABORATE FURTHER ON OUR ROLE IN REDUCING AND HELPING CLIMATE CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR I THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON MEMBERS. MONIES RICHARD CORY EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AIRBASE CELEBRATED ITS I OR IS ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY. AND OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WE ARE LOCAL DISTRICT PARTNERS HAVE ADOPTED AND IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION. WE'VE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED EMISSIONS FROM OXIDES OF NITROGEN OR KNOCKS. WHICH FORMS OZONE IN PARTICLES BY OVER 75% SINCE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND CARS ARE 99% CLEANER. 99%. WITH THE ENACTMENT OF AB THIRTY TWO IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX ARE MANDATE EXPANDED TO INCORPORATE CLIMATE CHANGE EMISSIONS. AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S MUCH FOCUS ON OUR CLEAN CAR TRUCK AND FUELS PROGRAMS. ELECTRICITY CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPORTANT SECTOR TO US. ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION FROM POWER PLANTS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE MANY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BUT ELECTRICITY ALSO HAS THE POTENTIAL PERFECT PROVIDE CLEAN VIRTUALLY POLLUTION FREE ENERGY. TO POWER HOMES CARS AND EQUIPMENT IN MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS PROMOTE INCREASED ELECTRICITY USE TO MEET OUR AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS TODAY ELECTRICITY PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 8% OF ARE STATIONARY SOURCE KNOCKS EMISSIONS PRIMARILY FROM NATURAL GAS POWER. SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN KNOCKS EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICITY GENERATION FACILITIES HAVE DECREASED ABOUT 18%. FOR GREENHOUSE GASES AB THIRTY TWO DIRECTS US TO LOOK AT NOT ONLY THE GHG. EMISSIONS ASSOCIATE WITH ELECTRICITY REPRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTRICITY WE IMPORT. ELECTRICITY IS RESPONSIBLE 419%. OVER TOTAL GHG EMISSIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICITY CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. DEPENDING UPON THE AVAILABILITY OF HYDROPOWER. THAT BEING SAID AND EVEN THROUGH RECENT SUSTAINED PERIOD OF DROUGHT GHG EMISSIONS HAVE DECLINED IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR. AND THE LARGEST INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE IN ACHIEVING THE TWENTY TWENTY OUR PS MANDATE. ABOUT 33% OUR PS. TURNING NOW TO THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING THE INTERACTION. BETWEEN A CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY IN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AS YOU KNOW. AARP RECENTLY ADOPTED THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN UPDATE WHICH CHARTS THE PATH TO ACHIEVE THE S. B. THIRTY TWO GHG REDUCTION TARGET A 40%. BELOW NINETEEN NINETY EMISSIONS BY. TWENTY THIRTY LATER THIS MONTH BOARD WILL CONSIDER THE SP THREE FIFTY INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN ELECTRICITY SECTOR AND INDIVIDUAL UTILITY PLANNING TARGETS. THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE RECENT SCOPING PLAN. THESE WERE DEVELOPED JOINTLY BY AIR BCP. AND THE CC. THE SCOPING PLAN IDENTIFIES. OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR DE CARBONIZED WHILE ALSO HELPING TO REDUCE. FALSO ENERGY AND RESIDENTIAL COMMERCIAL. AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS. EVERY TRACKS EMISSIONS FROM EACH SECTOR INCLUDING ELECTRICITY IN ORDER TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE STATE IS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE. GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS. AS A SIDE NOTE I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THE TWENTY TWENTY GHG GREENHOUSE GAS TARGET AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. THIS ISN'T JUST A CARRYOVER FROM THE RECESSION IN BACK CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN THE LONGEST PERIOD OF SUSTAINED GROWTH IN HISTORY. OR CONNIE HAS BEEN COME. IS BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT SPECIFICALLY A GROWING ECONOMY WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WE'VE SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF RENEWABLE POWER AND RENEWABLE FUELS BOTH DISPLACING TRADITIONAL FOSSIL FUELS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY GAINS ACROSS OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS CALIFORNIA IS NOW HOME 250% OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN THE UNITED STATES. RECEIVES 40% OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CLEAN FUELS INVESTMENTS. OUR PROGRAMS ARE BREAKING DOWN. MARKET BARRIER IN OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES CONTINUE TO OUTPACE OR EXPECTATIONS. AS REQUIRED BY AB THIRTY TWO WE ADMINISTER A GHG REPORTING PROGRAM AND PRODUCE AN ANNUAL GHG INVENTORY. FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR WE RELY ON ANNUALLY REPORTED AND VERIFY DATA AT THE SOURCE EVERY ELECTRICITY GENERATING PLAN THE STATE AND ALL IMPORTERS WHO OWN ELECTRICITY. ACROSS THE CALIFORNIA BORDER WALL THE STATUS THIRD PARTY VERIFIED. FOR IMPORTS A VERIFIABLE CHECKED FOR THE EXISTENCE OF CONTRACTS AND PHYSICAL DELIVERY FOR SPECIFIED POWER. IN OUR STAFF CHECKS TO ENSURE RENEWABLE GENERATION IS NOT BE DOUBLE COUNTED. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT OUR ROLE IS TO ENSURE THAT WE KNOW THE STATE'S TOTAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THAT WE HAVE ACCURATE DATA. TO SUPPORT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AS REQUIRED BY B. THIRTY TWO WE COUNT ALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO HAPPEN IN THE STATE AND ALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRICITY. IMPORTED TO SERVE CALIFORNIA LOAD RETRACT ACTUAL GHG EMISSIONS. BASED ON POWER GENERATION AND IMPORTS DELIVERS THAT ELECTRICITY INDIVIDUAL USERS. ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS DISCUSSED IN STAFF PAPER FOR THIS HEARING IS ON SPECIFIED POWER WHEN WE USE THAT TERM THAT REFERS TO IMPORTED. ELECTRICITY THAT CANNOT BE TIED TO A SPECIFIC SOURCE THROUGH CONTRACT IN WITH EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL DELIVERY TO THE STATE. IN THAT CASE WE SIGNED A DEFAULT WESTERN GRID FACT WITHOUT POWER IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN WE IMPORTED APPROXIMATELY 35% OF THE POWER AND WE NEED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE AMOUNT OF POWER THAT IS IMPORTED AS ON SPECIFIED A SMALL IT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT 8% OF THE TOTAL. MEGAWATT HOUR LOAD USE IN STATE AND IT'S BEEN DECREASING OVER TIME. ARE MANDATORY GHG REPORTING CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM ALSO CONTAIN REQUIREMENTS IT'S PROHIBITED CANCEROUS OR SHUFFLING. THAT MEANS REPORTED IMPORTS ZERO MISSION POWER VERIFIED TO BE REAL NOT POWER REDIRECTED FROM OTHER REGIONS WITH A MAYBE BACK FILLING BY FOSSIL GENERATION. THE HEARING TODAY ALSO GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION ON OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA AYSO. TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET SUPPORTS IMPLEMENTATION OF RGH DE PROGRAMS. SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN CARBON CHI SO HAVE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY. I REGARDING GIGI ACCOUNTING WE TELL JOINT PUBLIC WORKSHOPS ENGAGED WITH STAKEHOLDERS FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS. AS A RESULT OF OUR COLLABORATION WE DEVELOP METHODS TO ACCOUNT FOR GHG EMISSIONS OF ALL POWER IMPORTED TO SERVE CALIFORNIA LOAD TRANSFER TO THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET. REGIONALIZATION AND UNDERLYING DISPATCH MODELS MUST BE COMPATIBLE IN SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE. AIR QUALITY CLEAN ENERGY GOALS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY CAN BE AND ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH LEGISLATURE SISTER AGENCIES. ANTI SO TO ENSURE ACCURATE ACCOUNTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PROGRAM. TO THE EXTENT WE ENCOURAGE INCENTIVIZE THE BUILD OUT OF RENEWABLES. WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCING ENERGY UNMANNED. WE SHOULD SEE MORE RENEWABLES AVAILABLE MORE BROADLY ACROSS THE WEST IN A REGIONAL MARKET. FROM A GHG PERSPECTIVE AND GENERALLY FROM A CRITERIA AND AIR TOXICS SPECTER. THIS TO BE A BENEFICIAL OUTCOME THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. HE WAS CORY A QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] JEFF. I MISS PROFITABILITY -- JUST ASK YOU. TO EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON THE ISSUE OF IMPORTING. OF FOR MOTHER FROM OTHER STATES TO DEAL WITH OUR ANIMATED SEAT PERIODS WHERE WE ARE NEEDING TO BRING AND FROM MARKETEERS AROUND THE STATE AROUND THE COUNTRY -- IT'S BUNDLED COMES INTO OUR STATE DO WE KNOW IT TELL US WHAT THAT REPRESENTS THAT PROCESS AND ARE WE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING ARE WE GETTING WERE NOBLES ARE WE GETTING. COMBINATION RENEWABLES AND FOSSIL FUEL MORE FOSSIL FUEL THAN KNOWS WHAT WAS THAT PROCESS LOOK LIKE. SO -- AT BREAK UP THAT THAT THE RESPONSES -- FOR NON ENERGY IMBALANCE AS ACTION -- WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A CLEAR INDICATION WHAT IS BEHIND. THE SOURCE OF ENERGY WE HAVE TO RELY ON ON WHAT'S CALLED TAG INFORMATION AND THAT MAKE -- FEED INTO. SOME OF THE SOURCE SPECIFIC INFORMATION SPECIFIED RESOURCE INFORMATION THAT CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD HAS KNOWN FOR ITS ACCOUNTING -- THAT FOR THE UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES THEY DON'T THEY DON'T SPECIFY ON WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEHIND THAT ENERGY. UNDER THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY FOR REGIONALIZATION WE WOULD ACTUALLY DO MORE SOURCE SPECIFIC -- TRACKING AN ACCOUNTING OF THOSE DISPATCHES OF EXTERNAL RESOURCES TO SERVE LOW IN CALIFORNIA. AND WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY DO A RESOURCE SPECIFIC DISPATCH RATHER THAN JUST GET ON IMPORTED ENERGY THAT IS REALLY UNSPECIFIED AND ON TYPE NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC RESOURCE -- SO THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IF YOU -- DO MORE EXTERNAL RESOURCE SPECIFIC DISPATCH UNDER EM OR UNDER REGIONALIZATION. I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT -- SO THE QUESTION SO YEAR WERE IMPORTED ENERGY SAID IT WAS 35% AND THEN YOU SAID 88% MAKE WHAT -- BUT THE QUESTION FOR IMPORTING AYE BECAUSE THAT. I REMEMBER VISITING CAL I SO AND I WAS TOLD [inaudible] AT TIMES. WE HAVE SO MUCH ENERGY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH. SO CAN YOU HELP. FILL IN THAT GAP BECAUSE YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SEE THE STOCK CURVED EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT THE DUCK CURVE. NOW WE OVER PRODUCING CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SOLAR AND NOW YOU -- THERE'S TESTIMONY ABOUT IMPORTING ENERGY. OVERALL OVER THE YEAR -- WE ARE -- A NET IMPORTER OF ENERGY. THERE ARE TIMES INCREASING PERIODS OF TIME IN THE MIDDLE OF DAY WHERE WE HAVE -- EXCESS AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAN WHAT WE NEED TO SERVE OUR LOW. AND IT'S ACTUALLY THIS YEAR THAT WE STARTED TO SEE PERIODS OF TIME WHERE WE'RE DOING WE'RE OBSERVING NET EXPORTS. OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA IS SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT BEFORE -- THE YET OVER THE ENTIRE YEAR -- IF YOU IMAGINE THE DOCKER -- WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN WE LONG ON PORTS TO STILL BOUNCE THE A LOW DURING THOSE THAT EVENING LOW POLL -- ENDED ABOUT WE SEE ENCOURAGED TIME WHERE ABOUT HALF THAT RAMP IS BEING MANAGED THROUGH IMPORTS OF ENERGY -- AS OPPOSED TO INTERNAL RESOURCES AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY GETTING AN EXTERNAL ENERGY SOME OF THAT MAYBE HYDRO -- RESOURCES AND IT REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON INTERNAL GAS RESOURCES THAT COULD BE ADMITTING RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE POINT IS THAT OVER THE OVER THE YEAR WE'RE STILL SING ABOUT AS MISTER COREY INDICATED ABOUT 30% OF OUR TOTAL. LOAD IS BEING MET BY OUR IMPORTS -- BUT IF YOU LOOK AT PARTICULAR TIMES THAT DECREASES TO NEAR ZERO AND AS I INDICATED -- ACTUALLY NET EXPORTING NOW APPEAR IT'S TIME CUT SO WE HAVE THAT EXPORTS WE IMPORT ENERGY BUT OF THE ENERGY THAT WE IMPORT WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THE GHG LEVELS ARE WE YOU. YOU GUYS DO AN ESTIMATE THAT'S CORRECT. THAT WOULD PUT THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTOOD FROM TESTIMONY. I THINK AS WAS CORY NICATOR -- WHERE THERE IS SPECIFIED RESOURCES OTHER ABLE TO ACCOUNT THE FOR THAT GHG ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE SPECIFIC RESOURCES? I THINK THE 8% INDICATED WAS THE AMOUNT OF UNSPECIFIED RESOURCE THAN IMPORTED ENERGY. THOUGHT AND JUST FROM A POLICY RESPERS BECTIVE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IS IT BETTER TO IMPORT THIS ENERGY WORLD WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE GHG LEVELS ARE AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE. KEEPING SUBSYSTEMS ONLINE THAT WE DO HAVE IN STATE THAT WE SHUT DOWN -- FOR INSTANCE LIKE BIOMASS WITHERS GEOTHERMAL. AS GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES. IS IT BETTER TO KEEP IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE CAN CONTROL IT AND KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE AS OPPOSED -- TO IMPORTING SOMETHING WHERE WE'RE GUESSING WHAT THE GHG LEVELS ARE FOR THE OLD RECALL. I I WOULD SAY IT'S BETTER TO SEEK TO TRY -- TO GET MORE SOURCE SPECIFIC INFORMATION SO THAT YOU CAN MANAGE BOTH THE IMPORTS ON A SOURCE SPECIFIC BASIS AND WAY THOSE OPTIONS AGAINST INTERNAL RESOURCES AND THEIR MISSIONS AFFECTS [inaudible] GOT IT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE TO ME YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION HAS JUST ISSUED A RULING ABOUT PUTTING MORE SOLAR ON AND IF WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS ISSUE WITH. WITH A DUCK CURVE IN. AND THAT THESE ISSUES OF IMPORTING ENERGY. I I DON'T WHAT WHAT'S THE PLAN OVER AT THE I SO TWO TO DEAL WITH THIS INFLUX [inaudible] SO -- WHAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT OR A MULTITUDE OF SOLUTIONS TO DEAL WITH THE -- INCREASED AMOUNT OF SOLAR ENERGY AND POTENTIAL OVERSUPPLY -- SOME OF THOSE POINT TWO WORDS ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR REGIONALIZATION OTHER THINGS OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ARE -- STORING IT STORE AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF STORAGE -- USING OTHER SECTORS TO HELP YOU UTILIZE THOSE -- EXCESS CLEAN RESOURCES WHETHER IT BE ELECTRIC VEHICLES OR ELECTRIFYING OTHER SECTORS. AND THEN -- OTHER THINGS I MENTIONED IS USING THE CLEAN RESOURCES IN A WAY TO ACTUALLY UTILIZE THEM FOR CENTURY LIABILITY SERVICES THUS RELYING LESS ON OTHER EMITTING RESOURCES THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE. A HAVING TO STAY ON OTHERWISE I JUST BE ABLE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND DURING THE EVENING HOURS. SO THERE'S SUITE OF SOLUTIONS THAT TERRY ANY ONE OF THOSE PROBABLY DOESN'T DO IT BUT WE THINK THE SWEET TOGETHER IS PROBABLY THE DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO TO BE SUCCESSFUL. CUT IT NOW HOW WE COULD TALK ABOUT REGIONALIZATION STORAGE USING ANOTHER SECTORS WHAT HAVE WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THE EXISTING INFASTRUCTURE FOR YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE BIOMASS FOR INSTANCE. ADD TO HELP WITH. WHEN IT'S CLOUDY OUTSIDE AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT ENERGY BECAUSE IT'S NOT RELIANT -- THAT'S THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS AND INCREASE WE HAD INDICATED TO THE LOW'S SERVING ENTITIES KIND OF THIS AS I MENTIONED SORT OF WHAT WE AT VIEW AS THE OPTIMAL BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO PROPOSE THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT THEY THINK WILL MEET THE THE PORTFOLIO THAT WE LAID OUT IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING SO WHEN THEY FILE IN AUGUST -- THEY WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERK PROPOSED. STRATEGIES THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITHOUT PORTFOLIO. GOTTEN SO WILL THERE BE A WEIGHT FOR THE RELIABILITY ON THE SAID CALIFORNIA TO RELY ON BEING ABLE TO TO RELY ON THIS ENERGY. DEPENDING ON THE SOURCES COMING FROM WELL THAT ONE OF THE INPUTS WE USED TO DEVELOP -- THE PORTFOLIO WAS THE RELIABILITY NEEDS -- AND SO WE INCLUDED -- THE AND THE NECESSARY -- PLANNING RESERVE MARGIN AND OTHER RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS YOU NEED TO BE ME DAILY TO ME. AND AS I INDICATED IN MY PREPARED REMARKS KNOW WE'LL DO ANALYSIS -- TO CHECK FOR OPERABILITY RELIABILITY CAN BE MAINTAINED ON AS THE PORTFOLIOS COME TOGETHER FROM THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. AND WILL FEEL THAT BACK IN THROUGH THE A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS -- INTEGRATE RESOURCE PLAN PROCEEDING. CUT IT AND THEN JUST ONE MORE QUESTION IF I MAY. THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS ARE WE LOOKING AT THE NEGATIVE PRICING ON WHAT THAT MEANS FOR PAYERS. WELL HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE PLAN AS WELL YES. THANK YOU IN ISRAEL RANDOLPH YOU HE REALLY TOUCHED ON STORAGE. WE LOOK AT THE RELIABILITY FACTOR WITH THE DOCKERS OR WHATNOT. WHAT IS THE CURRENT SCORES THAT WE HAVE NOW THAT? I KNOW YOU MENTIONED OF FUTURE STORAGE PLANS BUT WHAT'S OUR COURT STORAGE CAPABILITY NOW. YOU KNOW I AM SORRY I DON'T KNOW OFFICE TALK MY HEAD IT'S YEAH CURRENTLY ON THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IT'S RELATIVELY SMALL. SO WE LOOK OF RELIABILITY WE TALK ABOUT SO I I COULD AYE AYE SO ON THE CALIFORNIA AND SO PART OF THE GRID AND THERE'S PROBABLY HUNDRED FORTY MEGAWATTS OF GRID CONNECTED ON A STORAGE. FACILITIES -- I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OR TWO THOUSAND AND WHAT'S EXPECTED TO BE DEVELOPED -- GOING FORWARD BUT RIGHT NOW BY HUNDRED FORTY AND I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTEEN THAT THIRTEEN HUNDRED PLANNED AND THEN THE I RP. REFERENCES TO PORTFOLIO BECAUSE FROM A TWO THOUSAND SO WE LOOK AMENITIES TO GET TO RENEWABLES. HAD CERTAIN DATES ARE. DO WE HAVE ANY KIND OF MANDATE FOR STORAGE FOR DATE CERTAIN. FOR THE THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS. JUST ELABORATE ON THE QUESTION EARLIER SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT STORAGE AND TALKING ABOUT BATTERY STORAGE -- THERE ARE OTHER LARGE SCALE EXISTING -- HYDRA STORAGE FACILITIES IN THE SYSTEM -- THINGS ABOUT TWO TO THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF EXISTING -- HYDRO STORAGE FACILITIES SOME OF THOSE ARE NOT CONTROLLABLE BECAUSE OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE IS TO MOVE WATER UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND ARE NOT REALLY AVAILABLE TO MUCH FOR ELECTRICAL USE -- BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT -- ARE SPECIFICALLY IS FOR PINE DEMAND. REALLY GET AGO WE GOOD RELIABILITY WHEN WE HAVE A DROUGHT THOSE ARE REALLY THE RELIABLE SOURCES SOME TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HAS TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED. IT HAS A CONSTANT. AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO MANDATE RENEWABLES TO A POINT. THAT WE ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BACK IT UP WITH A PLAN B.. IS THERE ANY KIND OF PLAN FOR THAT YOU KNOW I THINK I YOU RAISE AN EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON A BOTH AYE OUR P. AND RESOURCE ADEQUACY. IS -- MAKING SURE THAT THE OUR MODELING IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN ASSUMES THAT THE EXISTING GAS FLEET. IS HOTLINE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE ONES THAT ARE UNDER CONTRACT NOW STAY UNDER CONTRACT THROUGH. TWENTY THIRTY AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT IN THIS WAS PART OF THE PART OF OUR ANALYSIS IN ADOPTING THE MULTI YEAR REQUIREMENT WAS. ARE THOSE PLANS GOING TO HAVE. ADEQUATE FINANCIAL ABILITY -- TO TO STAY AFLOAT ARE THEY GONNA GET CONTRACTS THAT ARE SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THEM AVAILABLE -- BECAUSE OUR MODELING ASSUMES THAT THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE -- AND SO -- YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE FOUND TO BRING -- MARIN NOBLES AND DEAL WITH INTERMITTENCY BUT ALSO KEEP THAT -- FLEET RESPONSIVE -- AND UNDERSTAND WHERE -- IN LOCAL AREAS THEY MIGHT BE IDENTIFIED IS NO LONGER NECESSARY BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT UNLESS WE KNOW THAT THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE PLAN. SO WE GO ONE MORE QUESTION MISTER. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INCREASED -- DEMAND. ON THE GRID WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EXPERTS AND EXPANDING TO HOLD DESERVES ALL OF THE OTHER. OF OPPORTUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I'M NOT SEEING A BIG PUSH TO INCREASE TRANSMISSION BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE WHEN WE LOOK AT CAPACITY. THROUGH THIS THIS OPPORTUNITY SO. I MEAN IF NEED HERE INTEGRATED PLAN. I NEED I THINK IT REALLY LOOK LOOKS AT IT NEEDS TO LOOK AT A STORAGE IS A BACK UP. AND BE THE ABILITY. TO ADDRESS THEY HAD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY NEEDED. ASIDE I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME. KIND OF LOVE UNWILLINGNESS TO ADD TRANSMISSION -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE BECAUSE OF EITHER. OPPOSITION OR WHATEVER IT IS BUT I MEAN IF WE WANT TO BE 1100% -- GOAL ORIENTED WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THAT THAT PRODUCT SO. YOU NO WHAT WE DOING. TO LOOK AT AN ADDRESS THE ABILITY FOR TRANSMISSION. TO ADD THE THE GRID. SO I I DON'T KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT THE CALIFORNIA SO IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING FOR THE GREAT IT OVERSEAS -- AND THAT REGARD WE LOOK AT TRANSMISSION PLANNING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF GUIDED BY THE POLICIES -- AND DEVELOPMENT POLICIES AND THE RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE POLICIES GOING FORWARD SO. WILL MAKE OUR PLANNED FIT. TO SUPPORT THE SHERMAN -- PROCESS THAT IS COMING OUT OF THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN -- THAT'S ONE OF THE OBJECTIVES WE WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THAT BECAUSE WE MAY END UP DEVELOPING TRANSMISSION THAT'S NOT NECESSARY -- IF THE PLAN CHANGES SO WILL FOLLOW ALONG AND COORDINATE WITH AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN PROCESS ASSUMES THAT WE GO THROUGH THIS REFERENCE SYSTEM PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS EVERY TWO YEARS. SO AS CONDITION CHANGED AS CONDITIONS CHANGE IF WE SEE THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW INCREASED -- BEHIND THE METER -- PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR UPTAKE -- YOU KNOW WE CAN ADJUST ACCORDINGLY -- SO THAT KIND OF IT'S A VERY ITERATIVE PROCESS WITH US FEEDING INTO THE TRANSPORTATION DATA TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS FEEDING INTO LOW FORECASTING. WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME COORDINATING AMONGST THE AGENCIES TRYING TO GET THIS PROCESS RIGHT. THAT'S INCURSION THANK YOU. COULD YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE CENTRAL BUYER STRUCTURE THAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR PREPARED COMMENTS [inaudible] TERM. WE'RE REALLY JUST. STARTING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WORD LIMITING IT -- TO ACQUIRING LOCAL -- RESOURCE ADEQUACY CAPACITY -- CAPACITY AND WE HAVE REQUESTED PROPOSALS FROM THE PARTIES IN THE PRECEDING ABOUT WHO THIS THIS CENTRAL BUYER SHOULD BE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS. YOU CAN HAVE THE AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BE A CENTRAL BUYER YOU COULD HAVE A GOVERNMENT AGENCY BE THE CENTRAL FIRE -- THERE'S A LOT OF PROS AND CONS -- TO THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS BUT THE IDEA IS THAT AS THESE ENTITIES AS THERE ARE AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ENTITIES OUT IN THE MARKET BUYING SMALL BITS OF CAPACITY THAT MAYBE IT MAKES SENSE. TO CENTRALIZE THAT APPROACH AND HAVE ONE AND EIGHTY I'M DOING THE BUYING AND THEN WITH THE COST WOULD BE ALLOCATING YOU. A HIGH LAKE SOME OF THE PROS AND CONS TO THAT. WELL IT'S KIND OF PRESENT KINDS AS TO SO FOR INSTANCE THE THE CCA'S FOR INSTANCE WOULD PREFER NOT TO HAVE OTHER ENTITIES. A PURCHASING ON THEIR BEHALF THEY WANT TO BE ABLE --% TO PURCHASE THEIR OWN BASED ON THEIR OWN GUIDANCE FROM THERE -- ELECTED OFFICIAL GOVERNING BODIES SO THAT'S FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A KIND -- AND I HAVE TO ADMIT I HAVE A BIAS AGAINST HAVING A GOVERNMENT AGENCY -- PROPOSE IT BECAUSE I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT SETTING UP A WHOLE NEW -- GOVERNMENT ENTITY -- TO TO DO THE PURCHASING BUT THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAS BEEN FLOATED. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROS AND CONS TO THOSE OPTIONS AND SO WE ARE EXPECTING -- WITHIN THE NEXT -- THINK ON JULY TENTH WE'RE EXPECTING A WRITTEN PROPOSALS FROM OUR THE PARTIES IN THE PROCEEDING ABOUT -- HOW BEST THEY THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE? TO TO TAKE THIS APPROACH. MY COLLEAGUE. OF MINE BAKERSFIELD THAT. BASS WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TECH CURVE IN INTERMITTENT RESOURCES. DO YOU HAVE A BALLPARK FIGURE WHAT IT COSTS. TO HAVE BACK UP THE INTERMITTENT REESE. TIMES OF HIGH. THE DEMAND THAT NATURAL GAS FOR EXAMPLE SIR AN ESTIMATED COST TO THAT [inaudible] THE WE'VE TRIED TO ESTIMATE THT -- AND NOT HAVE -- TO MAKE SURE I GOT THE RIGHT FIGURES LIKE GET THAT TO YOU SHOULD LIKE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS COME. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WE'RE GONNA ASK THE NEXT SET OF PANELISTS -- TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. WE HAVE MATTHEW FRIEDMAN THAT WITH THAT. WE NEED TO REFORM NETWORK LINDA SERIZAWA OFFICE OF THE RAPIER ADVOCATES. SCOTT WHICH CARTER PLEDGE AND ASSOCIATES [inaudible] PAUL THOMPSON. WITH OR MEANT TECHNOLOGIES PETER MILLER NATURISTS WAS DEPEND. I THINK -- MR FRIEDMAN WILL BE PRESENTING AND HAVING TO ATTEND ANOTHER A COMMITMENT THAT [inaudible] THEREAFTER. THANK YOU FOR A JOIN US YOU. YOU MAY BEGIN AS FOLKS IT SETTLED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA -- MY NAME IS MATT FRIEDMAN AND I'M A STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE TO PRESENT ON THE ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. ON THE AGENDA FOR TODAY. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BARRIERS TO TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRIC PROCUREMENT. I'M AND HOW CHANGES IN ENERGY MARKETS ARE CREATING CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN WHAT THE STATE MIGHT NEED TO DO. TO ENSURE THAT NEW RESEARCH SURPLUS NEW RESOURCES ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO MEET STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES. BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO ACCEPTED APPROACH TO ASSIGNING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. TO ELECTRIC PROCUREMENT BY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. ALTHOUGH WE HAD A DISCUSSION THE PRIOR PANEL ABOUT THE CAP ANDTRADE PROGRAM THE CABIN TRADE PROGRAM ASSIGNS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS ONLY TO INSTATE GENERATORS AND IMPORTERS OF POWER. THE A OR B. HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE I SO AS WAS MENTIONED TO DEVELOP AN APPROACH FOR SIGNING GREENHOUSE GAS COSTS WITHIN THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET. BUT THEY'VE HAD THREE ITERATIONS OF THEIR PROPOSAL SO FAR AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT EVEN THE MOST RECENT ONE WILL WORK TO PREVENT RESOURCE SHUFFLING OR LEAKAGE. SO RIGHT NOW LOAD SERVING ENTITIES MAKING GREENHOUSE GAS CLAIMS ON THEIR PRODUCTS ARE USING WHATEVER APPROACH THEY FEEL IS MOST APPROPRIATE IN A SENSE. WE ARE IN THE WILD WEST AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S BEEN NO FACT CHECKING OF THESE CLAIMS BECAUSE THE STATE DOESN'T YET HAVE A STANDARD. THAT GOVERNS RETAIL PRODUCT DISCLOSURES. HOWEVER THERE ARE TWO PROCESS IS UNDER WAY THAT MIGHT HELP. ONE IS REVISIONS TO THE POWER CONTENT LABEL BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION PURSUANT TO ASSEMBLY BILL -- ELEVEN TEN AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S DRAFT PROPOSAL ALIGNS PRETTY CLOSELY WITH THE A ARBY'S APPROACH. WE EXPECT SOME STANDARD TO BE COMING OUT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN IN THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM THERE'S A CONSIDERATION OF ASSIGNING GREENHOUSE GAS PORTFOLIO TARGETS TO ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. AND TO DEVELOP A METHODOLOGY THAT LOOKS TO MATCH HOURLY PRODUCTION FROM RESOURCES WITH HOURLY LOADS FOR EACH LOW SERVING ENTITIES. IT'S STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS APPROACH WILL BE EFFECTIVE I'M AND THE PC IS REALLY JUST USING THAT TO LOOK AT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN. TWENTY THIRTY WE BELIEVE THAT PEACE TO COMMISSIONS MAY NEED TO CONSIDER OTHER APPROACHES DISCLOSURE THAT CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES THAT NEARLY RESHUFFLE EXISTING LOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION RESOURCES. AND THOSE THAT STIMULATE NEW INVESTMENTS IN INCREMENTAL RESOURCES. I WANT -- TO OFFER YOU A SPOT QUIZ HERE TODAY FOR LEGISLATORS ON THE PANEL WHAT'S THE QUICKEST AND CHEAPEST WAY TO ACQUIRE A 1100% ZERO CARBON ENERGY PORTFOLIO. THAT CAN BE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS AT THE LOWEST COST. IF YOU'RE JUST LOOKING TO OPTIMIZE CHEAPEST WAY TO OFFER A ZERO CARBON PORTFOLIO WHAT WOULD YOU DO. WELL WE DON'T HAVE TO GAS WERE SEEN IN THE MARKET TODAY. FIRST THERE'S LOTS OF LARGE HYDROELECTRIC PRODUCTION IN THE NORTHWEST CONSERVING CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES YOU CAN SIMPLY BY SOME ABOUT SURPLUS THAT'S ALREADY BEEN SERVING CALIFORNIA. AND VOILA YOU HAVE A ZERO CARBON PORTFOLIO. YOU CAN BUY TRADABLE RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS FROM PLACES LIKE BRITISH COLUMBIA ALBERTA WYOMING. AND YOU CAN ATTACH THEM TO SYSTEM POWER THAT YOU'RE BUYING IN CALIFORNIA FROM FOSSIL FUEL RESOURCES AND YOU CAN CLAIM YOU'VE GOT A ZERO CARBON PORTFOLIO. IF THAT'S WHAT A PROVIDERS OFFERING ARE YOU INSPIRED BY THAT. DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THAT PRODUCT IS MAKING A DIFFERENCE. AND COMPARED TO ANOTHER PRODUCT. THAT WOULD BE OFFERED WHERE A PROVIDERS ACTUALLY MAKING NEW INVESTMENTS. IN NEW RESOURCES DEMAND RESPONSE ENERGY STORAGE NEW RENEWABLE GENERATION. WOULD BE MORE INSPIRED BY THAT PRODUCT. HOW WOULD YOU TELL THE TWO APART? THE ONLY THING YOUR ASKED TO LOOK AT IS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BECAUSE THESE PORTFOLIOS NOT THE SAME. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT SIMPLY ASKING CUSTOMERS TO CHOOSE AMONGST VARIOUS OPTIONS DOESN'T NECESSARILY YIELD SUPERIOR OUTCOMES BECAUSE CUSTOMERS DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S MEANINGFUL IF THE ONLY METRIC IS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS [inaudible] ON AND THAT LEADS ME TO CHANGES AN ENERGY MARKETS AND HOW THEY'RE CREATING CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES -- WE HAVE AN INTERESTING PARADOX. DEMAND FOR CLEAN ENERGY HAS NEVER BEEN GREATER AT THE CUSTOMER LEVEL EVERYONE IS CLAMORING FOR CHEAPER AND CLEANER RESOURCES. PRICES OF THESE RESOURCES ARE AT ALL TIME LOWS. THERE ARE TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THEIR SUN SETTING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BUT WE'RE NOT SEEING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW RESOURCES. THE PIPELINE IS ESSENTIALLY RUN DRY. FOR PROJECTS BEING DEVELOPED FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR DISTRICT MISTER GARCIA. WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY DEMAND THAT'S GOING TO GET THOSE GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS BILL. SO WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT'S GOING ON IS THAT WE'RE SEEING RETAIL MARKET FRAGMENTATION. ESSENTIALLY AND ATOMIZATION OF RETAIL MARKETS WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO RECNCILE THE PARADIGMS OF PLANNING. AND CHOICE. IF EVERY CUSTOMER GETS TO CHOOSE WHATEVER THEY WANT. HOW DO WE ENSURE THOSE CHOICES ADD UP TO SOME KIND OF LONG TERM RESOURCE PLAN? AND OF CUSTOMERS ARE CONSTANTLY SHIFTING BETWEEN PROVIDERS POWER THE PROVIDERS GONNA HAVE THE SECURITY THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW NEW RESOURCES TO GET BILL. WE ARE STUCK IN A VERY DIFFICULT PLACE. WE'VE SEEN THE GROWTH OF COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. AND COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS ARE IN PRINCIPLE VERY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING A CLEANER PORTFOLIO. BUT THEIR BRAND NEW ENTITIES THEY HAVE NO TRACK RECORD. ALMOST NONE OF THEM HAVE CREDIT RATINGS. AND SO THEY'RE NOT REALLY ABLE CURRENTLY. TO GET BIG NEW INVESTMENTS IN NEW RESOURCES. THERE'S A CONVERSATION ABOUT EXPANDING DIRECT ACCESS HERE -- BILL THAT WAS HEARD JUST LAST WEEK IN THE ASSEMBLY TOADIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. ON DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS ARE INHERENTLY SHORT TERM IN THEIR BEHAVIOR. THEY BUY AND SELL SHORT THEIR CUSTOMERS SIGNED UP FOR ONE YEAR MAYBE TO YOUR COMMITMENTS. THEY DON'T MAKE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS IN THE WHOLESALE MARKET. AND THE UTILITIES ARE BASICALLY OUT OF THE PROCUREMENT GAME. THEY WENT FROM BEING BIG BUYERS OF NEW RESOURCES TO NET SELLERS. AND THE UTILITIES ARE EXTREMELY RELUCTANT TO ENGAGE IN ANY NEW COMMITMENTS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM [inaudible] WELL. THE STATE NEEDS TO HAVE COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE PLANNING REQUIREMENTS. AND VIABLE MECHANISMS TO ACHIEVE THOSE DEFINED OBJECTIVES. WHAT'S THAT LOOK LIKE WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR PS PROGRAM. WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT AND THAT'S ESSENTIAL BUT IT'S A FLOOR. IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT TO GET US TO THE NEXT STEP OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO. ALTHOUGH WE DO BELIEVE THAT EXPANDING THE OUR PS PROGRAM. ACCELERATING THE TARGETS WOULD HELP. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM COMMISSIONER RANDOLPH WAS DISCUSSING THAT IN THE LAST PANEL. BUT THERE'S UNCLEAR METRICS FOR ASSESSING COMPLIANCE AND A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONS ABILITY TO ENFORCE MEANINGFUL REQUIREMENTS. ON ALL THE DIFFERENT LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. IT IT JUST TURNS INTO AN EXERCISE OF EVERY LOAD SERVING ANY REPORTING WHAT THEY'RE DOING. IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THAT SIMPLY SETTING SIMPLE TARGETS FOR EVERY ENTITY WILL ENCOURAGE ALL THE BUYERS. SELLERS AND TRADERS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANY LOOPHOLE OR AMBIGUITY IN THE RULES TO SEEK LEAST COST OUTCOMES THAT MAY PRODUCE RESULTS EVERY DIFFERENT. FROM WHAT POLICYMAKERS ARE EXPECTING. IN OUR VIEW RESOLVING THE MISMATCH BETWEEN SHORT TERM. MARKET ACTORS AND LONG TERM GOALS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A NEW SET OF PROCUREMENT STRUCTURES. ONE OPTION THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION HERE IS JUST REQUIRE EVERY LOAD SERVING ENTITY TO ACQUIRE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ANY NEW POLICY OBLIGATION. THE PROBLEM IS HOW DO YOU MAKE A LARGE NUMBER OF BUYERS TAKE A FRACTIONAL SHARE OF A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF NEW RESOURCES. THEY'RE APPROXIMATELY FIVE DEVELOPERS OF SALTON SEA GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS THERE ARE OVER SEVENTY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. HOW WOULD A GEOTHERMAL MANDATE THAT APPLIES TO SEVENTY LOAD SERVING ENTITIES THAT HAVE TO BUY A FRACTIONAL SHARE A FIVE RESOURCES REALLY OPERATING PRACTICE? HOW WOULD WE DEAL WITH MARKET POWER ABUSES BY SELLERS? IN ORDER TO MAKE A LONG TERM PROCUREMENT OBLIGATION WORK. WE'RE GONNA NEED A NEW STRUCTURE. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE GUARANTEED RATE RECOVERY. IT MAY NEED TO REQUIRE MAY BE TO INVOLVE A THIRD PARTY ENTITY THAT GOES OUT AND DOES SOME OF THIS PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF ALL LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. IT COULD BE A STATE AGENCY. IT COULD BE THE GREAT OPERATOR ALTHOUGH THAT CREATES PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH FEDERAL PREEMPTION AND FEDERAL JURISDICTION. IN ANY CASE I GUESS WHAT I'D LIKE TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE HERE WITH IS THE NEED TO THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR NEXT SET OF POLICY OBJECTIVES. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO DESIGN SOME OF THESE MECHANISMS THAT ALLOCATE COSTS. BARELY AND THAT ENSURE THAT WHEN THE STATE DECIDES THERE ARE CERTAIN RESOURCES IT WOULD LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPED. THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF MECHANISM FOR MAKING IT HAPPEN AND WE DON'T JUST HOPE THAT THE MAGIC OF THE MARKET PRODUCES THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS. THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU FOR INVITING THE OFFICER IF YOU'RE OUT THE GETS TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING MY NAME IS LINDA SERIZAWA I'VE THE A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OVER ENERGY AND AND OR A MORESO STATES. INDEPENDENT CONSUMER ADVOCATE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. OUR MISSION IS TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF OF OF RATE PAYERS TO INSURE THE LOWEST COST. FOR SAFE AND RELIABLE SERVICE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. WE NOT ONLY FOCUS ON ENERGY ISSUES WE ARE SUPPOSE O. FOCUS ON COMMUNICATIONS AND WATER MATTERS AS WELL WITHIN THE PC AND IN OTHER FORUMS. MOVING ONTO THE COMMITTEE'S QUESTIONS -- SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE'RE EXCEEDING THE RATE RENEWABLE TARGETS AND PLANNING IS UNDER WAY TO MEAN AN AGGRESSIVE GHG REDUCTION GOAL. THE RPF HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL SO SUCCESS THAT SUCCESSFUL THAT IT HAS CHANGED HOW THE GREAT OPERATES IN A SPIRIT INVESTMENT IN MORE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF RENEWABLES. THE PRICE OF RENEWABLES IS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY SO MUCH SO THAT THEY ARE FREQUENTLY COMPETITIVELY PRICED WITH CONVENTIONAL FUELS. OR HAS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE CPC'S NEW HIGHER P. ARE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS. WHICH WAS INITIATED PURSUIT SB. THREE FIFTY THE ART IRB IS THE CRITICAL COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS THAT WILL CONTAIN BE CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS. AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ENERGY PROCUREMENT. AS MENTIONED EARLIER IN A RECENT RP DECISION THE COMMISSION ADOPTED A REFERENCE SYSTEM PLAN WITH THE GHG EMISSIONS TARGET FOR THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR OF TWENTY THIRTY THIS TARGET REPRESENTS A 61% DECREASE IN GHG EMISSIONS FROM NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. AND ALSO IS EQUIVALENT 258% OF TOTAL PROCUREMENT COMING FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY. IT IS NOTABLE THAT BASED ON THIS PLAN BY TWENTY THIRTY ANY INCREMENTAL GENERATION ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S RESOURCE MIX. WE'LL COME FROM SOLAR ENERGY EFFICIENCY. STORAGE WIND AND GEOTHERMALAND NO NO GAS FIRED GENERATION. ALL WHILE MAINTAINING SAFETY RELIABILITY AND MINIMIZING BAKER COSTS. ORIS FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT THE STATE'S TARGET IS ACHIEVED IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MANNER AND WITH REALIZE BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. AS PART OF OUR EVALUATION OF THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES OR ELSIE'S FIRST INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN PROJECT DUE TO BE FILED ON AUGUST FIRST. WE WILL EXAMINE THE METHODOLOGIES AND INPUTS THE MODELS USED AND WHETHER THE PLANS ARE COST EFFECTIVE. ACOSTA EFFECTIVELY MEET THE STATE'S GOALS IN A CONSISTENT WITH THE CPU SEES GUIDANCE. WE ALSO WILL BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT ALL ELISSEEFF ARE ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF EXISTING AND NEW RESOURCES ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND THAT THEY GIVE PREFERENCE TO RENEWABLE PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO THESE COMMUNITIES. CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES ALSO CAN BRING ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS JOBS AND INCREASED TAX REVENUE. OUR A SEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THESE BENEFITS FLOATED CUSTOMERS AND ARE EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED. SOME CHALLENGES DO LIE AHEAD AS YOU HEARD. IF LLC SUCH AS CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS PROVIDERS DO NOT PLAN FOR SUFFICIENT PROCUREMENT TO SUPPORT RELIABILITY. THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ORDER LONG TERM PROCUREMENT COMMITMENTS. IN THIS SITUATION IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME ARE ALREADY PEERS WOULD INCUR HIGHER COSTS. THEREFORE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT ALL ELLIS CEASED MEET THEIR PROCUREMENT OBLIGATIONS. ALSO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE DEPLOYMENT OF AN OPTIMAL MIX OF COST EFFECTIVE RESOURCES THAT SERVE LOAD. INTEGRATE ME NORMALS ENSURE RELIABILITY AND MEET THE STATE'S GHG GOALS FLEXIBILITY TO CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE RESOURCES MUST BE PRESERVED. ANOTHER CHALLENGES UP THE UTILITIES CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTED FOR RENEWABLES IN EXCESS OF WHAT IS NEEDED TO MEET THERE ARE PS TARGETS AND THEY ARE SELLING OFF EXCESS RENEWABLE ENERGY AS YOU. ALSO HEARD. WHEN WE NO CONTRACTS A RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS ARE SOLD IS USUALLY AT A LOSS THAT'S COSTING RAPIERS FROM RENEWABLE ENERGY THEY ARE NOT USING? TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS ENERGY FROM A CLEAN RESOURCE MUST REPLACE A GHG EMITTING RESOURCE AND NOT BE SOLD OR USE IN ADDITION TO A GHG EMITTING RESOURCE. THE I RP OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE SITUATION TO HELP DETERMINE THE BEST PORTFOLIO MIX BASED ON WHAT IS AVAILABLE. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND STORED. ALSO ARE WAYS OF THAT CAN ADDRESS THIS IS THE SITUATION. AS FOR VARIOUS TO TRACKING GHG EMISSIONS THE CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW IS REALLY HOW TO COUNT THEM. IN AN ISOLATED SYSTEM IT'S EASY TO DETERMINE THE SYSTEMS TOTAL EMISSIONS AND GENERATION BUT AS YOU'D GOTTEN UTILITIES RETAIL SELLERS AND OVERLAPPING BOUNDARIES IT BECOMES INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY ASSIGN EMISSIONS TO INDIVIDUAL ENTITIES. THE PC HAS ADOPTED A REASONABLE APPROACH WHICH WE WHICH WILL BE TESTED IN THE UPCOMING IRP PLANS. DO FROM THE LLC'S IN AUGUST. OR A WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE EVALUATION OF HOW WELL IT WORKS AND WHETHER IT NEEDS ADJUSTMENT. THE IRP PROCESS HELPS TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR NUVEEN RENEWABLE PROJECTS INCLUDING THEIR TIGHTENING. THE PLANNING MODEL FOR TWENTY THIRTY USE IN THE IP PROCEEDING SELECTED A MIX OF INCREMENTAL RENEWABLE AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT COST EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE RELIABILITY AND SYSTEM FLEXIBILITY TO INTEGRATE MORE RENEWABLES. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. P. UC'S REFERENCE SYSTEM PLAN ACHIEVES A 58% ARE PS AND AS SUCH THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASING RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS. SP THREE FIFTY DRIVES INCREASE RENEWABLE ENERGY BY REQUIRING THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND BEYOND. STEVE 5% OF THE RETAIL SELLERS RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS MUST BE PROCURED THROUGH LONG TERM COMMITMENTS THAT IS THEY MUST UP TERMS OF TEN YEARS OR MORE. WHILE THE LARGE UTILITIES HAVE MET THIS REQUIREMENT OTHER LSE'S. SUCH AS CCA'S ALSO MUST PROCURE SUFFICIENT LONG TERM OUR PS ELIGIBLE RESOURCES. IN THE COMMISSION'S CURRENT. RESOURCE ADEQUACY WILL MAKING AUREUS. FRAMEWORK THAT REQUIRES A PC IN KAISER TO WORK TOGETHER TO DETERMINE WHAT RESOURCES MUST BE RETAINED. AND THE NEED FOR NEW PROCUREMENT TO ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL SHORTFALLS. RESOURCES COULD BE PROCURED BY COALITION OF LSE'S TO ENABLE FINANCING OF NEW FACILITIES BY ALLOCATING THE COSTS AND BENEFITS EQUITABLY A PROPORTIONALLY. BETWEEN TWO OR MORE ELLIS HE'S WORKING TOGETHER. WHILE MAINTAINING RELIABILITY. AS AN EXAMPLE. PGDM EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY HAVE EMBARKED ON AN INNOVATIVE COLLABORATION TO PROCURE NEW RESOURCES TO REPLACE A PETROLEUM BASED GENERATOR IN OAKLAND. OR A SUPPORTS THE SPECIFIC EFFORT. SUCH COOPERATION COULD ENABLE THE LONG TERM PROCUREMENT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE VITAL TO MEET LONG. LOCAL RESOURCE ADEQUACY NEEDS WHILE SHARING THE COSTS OF NECESSARY RESOURCES AND AVOIDING COSTLY BACKSTOP GERMAN. IN CONCLUSION THE STATUS SUCCESSFULLY MEETING ITS RENEWABLE TARGETS MISS AT A COMPREHENSIVE PATH FORWARD THROUGH THE COMMISSION SPIRE P. PROCESS PROGRESSIVE GHG REDUCTION. UTILITIES ARE CURRENTLY EXCEEDING THEIR TARGETS AND WE KNOW THE PRICES OF DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE HURDLES IN GETTING NEW RENEWABLE PROJECTS ONLINE ALTHOUGH THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN ENSURING RENEWABLES THAT ARE ALREADY PROCURED. ARE USED. THE CCA'S ANOTHER RETAIL SELLERS OF THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATES FOR INCREASED RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF S. B. THREE FIFTIES NEW LONG TERM CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS. I'LL STOP THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SOME MY NAME IS HUNDRED MISTER CHAIR NICE TO SEE YOU MY NAME'S HUNTER STERN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY. EMPLOYEES -- AND I'LL KNOW THAT -- WHEN YOU MENTIONED -- SCOTT WHICH IS NAMED THE YOUR COLLEAGUES GOT UP AND LEFT. SO WHAT WHAT I WANTED. TO I'M GLAD SOME IS AWAKE. OKAY SO WHAT WHAT WE WANTED TO COVER -- MOST OF WHAT WE WERE. THERE'S ARE PROBABLY PICKED UP BY -- FOLLOW FOLLOWING SPEAKERS AS WELL BUT LET'S LET US SERVE FOCUSING ON THREE DIFFERENT AREAS -- IN TERMS OF OF THE CHALLENGES TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- SIMPLY PUT WE DON'T HAVE A STANDARDIZED APPROACH -- THE STATE DOESN'T CURRENTLY DO WHAT IS NEEDED TO DO TO DO TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH. COMMISSIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WHICH RESOURCES WHICH LOAD SERVING ENERGIES ARE USING -- THERE'S HOPE -- THAT -- QUE BE -- ELEVEN TEN WHICH IS PAST COUPLE YEARS AGO AND IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING A REGULATORY APPROVAL AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION -- WILL DO THAT -- BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME GAPS. AND SO THAT'S FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED A STANDARDIZED APPROACH -- SECONDLY IN TERMS OF THE MAJOR CHANGE IN ENERGY PER CHAIRMAN -- IT'S THAT ITS WHO. ARE NOW PROCURING ELECTRICITY -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- COMMISSIONER PETERMAN MENTIONED CCA'S ARE ON THE RISE THAT IS THE BIG DIFFERENCE HOME WHERE THREE YEARS AGO THEIR PROCURING ALMOST NOTHING. AND IN THE FUTURE THEY MAY PROCURE SO MUCH AS 80% OF THE POWER -- THAT IS A HUGE CHANGE AND THE IMPACTS OF THAT CHANGE ARE BEING FELT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THROUGHOUT THE CLEAN POWER GOALS AT THE STATUS SAID ITSELF -- AND THEN AGAIN THIS IS A SIMPLIFIED OR A SHORTER VERSION OF WHAT I PLAN TO SAY -- THE CHALLENGES OF OF BUILDING NEW ENERGY PROJECTS OF THIS IS OUR WORK -- THE IBEW DE IS [inaudible] THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF UTILITY EMPLOYEES -- AND WE REPRESENT WORKERS HAD THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE PUBLIC PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES AND WE HAVE OUR CONSTRUCTION MEMBERS WHO BUILT THESE PROJECTS. AND THE CURRENTLY NOT DOING A MISTER FRIEDMAN MENTIONED THIS -- AT ONE POINT THERE WAS AS MANY AS FIFTEEN THOUSAND FULL TIME EQUIVALENTS -- WHICH IS A FANCY WAY OF SAYING AHEAD -- WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS ANNUALLY -- AND NOW IT'S VERY MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT -- WE NEED THE COMMITMENT. TO HAVE RESOURCES BUILT. AND USED IN THE STATE -- THERE ARE -- EVEN -- YEAH THE CHI SO IS PART OF THEIR THREE FIFTY STUDIES IDENTIFIED THE POTENTIAL OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND JOBS BEING LOST. LOST IF THE SO CALLED BUCKET SYSTEM IS NOT RETAIN -- THAT'S PART OF HOW WE DEVELOPED THE PROGRAM AND THIS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. OF THESE GOALS WHETHER IS THREE FIFTY OR TO SP TWO ONE ACTS BEFORE IT -- AND THE RPF ALL THE WAY THROUGH -- THE MAJOR CHALLENGE IS ENSURING THAT THE SPOT COMMUNITY TRACE AGGREGATORS ARE SIGNING LONG TERM POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHICH THEN CREATE THE CONFIDENCE. IN THE DEVELOPERS IT TAKEN GOING TO SEEK THE FUNDING THE LOANS TO BUILD THE PROJECTS THEMSELVES. IF THOSE POWER IF THOSE PPACA SHORT TERM -- THEY CAN'T GET MONEY TO THE DEVELOPERS CAN GET MONEY TO BUILD THEM AND OUR MEMBERS DON'T WORK. AND AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT JUST THE AYE BE DONE. EFFORT TRADES UNIONS THAT ARE OPERATING ON A PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUILDING THE SOLAR PROJECTS CURRENTLY IT'S BEEN A VERY EFFECTIVE. VERY -- EFFICIENT JOB SOURCING HIGH GOOD JOBS OBVIOUSLY GOOD PAYING BUT ALSO LOWER COST ELECTRICITY. SO ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN A WIN AND NOW WE'RE LETTING IT SLIP THROUGH OUR HANDS. SO. IN IN SHORT. AND SWEET TERMS -- IN ORDER RETAIN THOSE JOBS IN ORDER TRAIN TO RETAIN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WE NEED TO ASSURE THE DIS. A ENTITIES TO LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ALL OF THEM APART BUT PARTICULARLY THE ONES THAT HAVE TO PROCURE POWER IN THE FUTURE. NOT JUST TO MEET THE RPF REQUIREMENTS NOT JUST TO MEET THEIR EMISSIONS RATES BUT ALSO TO MAKE COMMITMENTS SO THAT THE INDUSTRY CAN MOVE FOR HERE IN THE STATE. WE NEED ALL THOSE THINGS TO HAPPEN AND FRANKLY IT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THESE COMMENTS. YOU ARE FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS PAUL THOMPSON ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNMENT AND REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR OR MET TECHNLOGIES. YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF YOU THAT I'M GOING TO WALK THROUGH BRIEFLY AND THEN BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE -- LIMIT TECHNOLOGIES IS A RENEWABLE ENERGY COMPANY DOING BUSINESSIN CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTY THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND HAVE BEEN. ANNUALLY OMITTING ABOUT FOUR POINT TWO MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND THAT INCLUDES ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE MEGAWATTS OF GEOTHERMAL POWER THAT WE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA BOTH IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY. AND NEAR MAMMOTH LAKES CALIFORNIA -- TOTAL -- FROM AN INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE TODAY WE OPERATE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY MEGAWATTS OF GEOTHERMAL ENERGY. AND WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO THE WATTS OR TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF GEOTHERMAL AROUND THE WORLD. FORMAT IS ALSO MORE THAN JUST A GEOTHERMAL ENERGY COMPANY TODAY WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT STORAGE AND WE OPERATE A STORAGE COMPANY CALLED FOR RITA DE AND IT JUST -- INSTALLED TO TWENTY MEGA WATTS -- ONE HOUR STORAGE BATTERIES FOR FORTY MEGAWATT HOURS OF STORAGE WHICH IS WHICH IS ABOUT 5% OF THE NATION'S STORAGE CAPABILITY. WE ARE LOOKING AT STORAGE PROJECTS IN ADDITION IN CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE BUILT SOLAR PROJECTS AND WE ALSO -- CREATE A PRODUCT CALLED RECOVERED ENERGY GENERATION WE CAN TAKE THE EXHAUST HEAT ON NATURAL GAS PIPELINES AND PRODUCE ADDITIONAL -- EMISSION FREE ENERGY FROM OUR NATION'S NATURAL GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT SETS US APART IS THAT WERE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPANY WE STARTED BY MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AND TODAY? WE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TRULY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPANY SO WE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE THE EQUIPMENT. WE DO THE DRILLING WE DO THE ENGINEERING OF THE FACILITIES WE MANUFACTURE THEM WE CAN CONSTRUCT THEM AND WE CAN OWN AND OPERATE THEM AND THAT ALLOWS. A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR US TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA LIKE WE'RE DOING. 65% OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM THE SALE OF ELECTRICITY IN ABOUT 35% OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT HE IT ALLOWS US TO BE THE MOST ACTIVE GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPER TODAY IN THE UNITED STATES -- WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS WE'VE DEVELOPED IN THE LAST DECADE. AND THAT HAS JUST MADE US THE LARGEST U. S. BASED GEOTHERMAL OPERATOR IN THE COUNTRY. AS I SAID WE'VE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MEGAWATTS IN CALIFORNIA. ENORME SO WE'VE FORTY MEG ALL FACILITY A KEEPER WE HAVE AN EIGHTY NINE MEGAWATT FACILITY BRAWLEY. WHERE THIRTEEN MEGAWATT FACILITY IN? AND JUST PUT THOSE NUMBERS KIND OF IN FACT IN PERSPECTIVE A THIRTY MEGAWATT GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT. ANNUALLY CONTRIBUTES ABOUT FIVE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO THE ECONOMY AND OPERATIONS IN ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED K. IN TAXES. AND REQUIRES ABOUT A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR CAP EX -- SO IT'S THOSE ARE NOT SMALL FIGURES WE'VE INVESTED JUST ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN IN CALIFORNIA. ANNUALLY TO PAY ABOUT TWO POINT EIGHT MILLION IN TAXES. TWENTY NINE POINT SIX MILLION IN OUR OPERATIONS AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT EMPLOYMENT TODAY EACH ONE OF THOSE THIRTY MEGAWATT COMPLEXES EMPLOYEES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FULL TIME EMPLOYEES ONCE THE PROJECT IS UP AND OPERATING. CONTRARYTO WHAT YOU HEARD TODAY WE ARE DEVELOPING. A PROJECTS IN THE IMPERIAL VALLEY TRUCK HAVEN IS A PROJECT THAT WE HAVE UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT WE'RE EXPANDING OUR MAMMOTH FACILITY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROJECT CALLED CASA DIABLO FOR IN MONO COUNTY. AND WE JUST ACQUIRED A COMPANY CALLED U. S. GEOTHERMAL WHICH HAS A LEASES IN THE GEYSER AREA AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THOSE NEW RESEARCH THINGS THAT WE'VE OBTAINED. WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THE GEOTHERMAL SECTOR TODAY IS KIND OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND ON SLIDE SEVEN THE YOU HAVE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT IN THE LAST DECADE 90% OF THE GEOTHERMAL PROJECTS THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH A BINARY TECHNOLOGY? AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT IT ALLOWS FLEXIBILITY. FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE CAN DEVELOP LOW TEMPERATURE RESOURCES THEY PRODUCE NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY FLEXIBLE SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE CARBON ICING THE GRID. GEOTHERMAL TWO POINT OH WERE CALLING IT. IS REALLY EXCITING TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES LOAD SERVING ENTITIES CCA'S AND OTHERS BECAUSE WE CAN RAMP THE OUTPUT OF THESE FACILITIES. TO MITIGATE THE DUCK CURVE -- I FELT OBLIGED TO INCLUDE A SLIDE OF THE DARKER BECAUSE I BUT DIDN'T THINK YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THAT. JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT THE VALUE OF THE ENERGY IS SHIFTING CONSIDERABLY AND SO. IF YOU GO TO MY S. LIKE TEN YOU'LL SEE. GEOTHERMAL VALUE TODAY IS INCREASING IMMENSELY BECAUSE WE PRODUCE POWER WHEN THE INTERMITTENT RESOURCES DAHLE. IT'S IT'S THAT SIMPLE. CALIFORNIA WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPING INTERMITTENT RESOURCES IT DEVELOP CLOSE TO FOURTEEN GIGAWATTS OF INTERMITTENT RESOURCES IN THE LAST DECADE. AND WHAT THAT DONE HAS SHIFTED THE FOCUS TO RESOURCES THAT ARE EMISSION FREEING CAN PRODUCE POWER CAPACITY OR ENERGY WHEN YOU NEED IT. AND SO TODAY IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING THE GEOTHERMAL HAS A VALUE COMBINED VALUE OF BOTH ENERGY CAPACITY AND ANCILLARY BENEFITS. OF CLOSE TO THIRTY TWO DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR MORE THAN JUST SOLAR PEAVEY. AND THAT'S ALLOWING US TO SECURE CONTRACTS TODAY MOVING FORWARD AND THAT'S THAT'S THE EXCITING PART. IF I TAKE YOU DISLIKE TWELVE OF OF MY FLIGHT DECK YOU'LL SEE GEOTHERMAL TWO POINT KNOWING YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE A LITTLE DESCRIPTION THE BINARY PROCESS AND TO TRY TO BOIL IT DOWN TO ITS SIMPLE IS THE DESCRIPTION. WE BRING UP HIGH GEOTHERMAL FLUID WE HEAT A SECONDARY WORKING FLUID WHICH IS WHAT VAPORIZES BUILDS PRESSURE TURNS THE TURBINE. THE BEAUTY OF THAT IS WE INJECT BACK INTO THE RESERVOIR. AND THE WORKING FLUID WHICH VAPORIZES WE KEEP IN A CLOSED SYSTEM. SO IT -- COOLS BACK DOWN TURNS BACK INTO LIQUID HEAT BACK UP AND THERE'S NEAR ZERO EMISSIONS WHAT THIS ALLOWS US TO DO IS PROVIDE. CRITICAL SERVICES TO THE GRID TO HELP WITH THE CARBONIZATION WE CAN PROVIDE FLEXIBLE CAPACITY MEAN WE CAN RAMP THE ENTIRE FACILITY -- FENCES FACILITY PERMIT. WE CAN PROVIDE REGULATION SERVICES FREQUENCY RESPONSE SERVICES AND CONTINGENCY RESERVES SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS DEEP PENETRATION OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE RESOURCES AND HOW ARE WE GOING. TO KIND OF BRING THOSE ON AND BACK THOSE UP WITH A CARBON FREE RESOURCE GEOTHERMAL TO POINT IT CAN BE OUR ANSWER. WE ALSO PROVIDE NONTRADITIONAL ANCILLARY SERVICES LIKE VOLTAGE CONTROL AND INERTIA. GETTING SPECIFICALLY OF WELL THAT THE LAST THING I'LL POINT OUT AND WE HEARD COMMISSION RANDOLPH TALK ABOUT IT. THE CPUC RESOLVE MODEL PDATED WITH ITS MOST RECENT LOAD FORECAST SELECTED ABOUT SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF NEW GEOTHERMAL IN THE FORTY TWO AND T. SCENARIO. AND THE COST THAT THEY USE THAT IT WAS STILL SELECT WAS ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY SIX CENTS TO NINETY ONE DOLLARS AND SIXTY THREE CENTS A MEGAWATT HOUR. THOSE PRICES ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. IF YOU TAKE THE MOST RECENT PP ACHE CONTRACTS EXECUTED IN CALIFORNIA. THE MODEL YIELDS ABOUT TWO POINT FIVE GIGAWATTS OR THREE GIGAWATTS OF NEW GEOTHERMAL TO BE DEVELOPED. WHEN YOU ALSO TAKE OFF THE CONSTRAINT OF THE RESOURCE AREA? AND WHEN WE ARE EXPERTS WERE LOOKING AT THE RESOLVE MODEL WE WERE KIND OF CONSTRAINED TO JUST CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU TAKE OFF THOSE CONSTRAINTS IN A REGIONAL APPROACH YOU'LL SEE THAT EXPANDS THE THREE GIGAWATTS OF GENERATION AND I THINK AT SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS HAVE SAID? WE'RE GONNA NEED EVERYTHING IN OUR WHEELHOUSE TO DEVELOP THOSE RESOURCES CONSIDERING CAL YOU KNOW THE NATION HAS ABOUT. THREE POINT FIVE GIGAWATTS OF TOTAL GEOTHERMAL GENERATION OPERATING AND IT'S TAKEN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS TO DEVELOP SO WE THINK BUCKET ONE ELIGIBILITY IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. AND WE NEED TO START DEVELOPING ALL THE FAST AS POSSIBLE. K. GEOTHERMAL -- SURVIVE IN A CHANGING MARKET WE THINK THE ANSWER IS ABSOLUTELY YES. FOR THE LAST THIRTY YEARS WE'VE ONLY SOLD POWER TO INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT IS CHANGING WHERE NOW SELLING IT TO PEEL USE WE ARE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH CCA'S. WE SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH LARGE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL OPERATORS WHO RECOGNIZE THIS INCREDIBLE VALUE OF THE GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE THAT'S NOT ONLY EMISSION FREE. BUT CAN RAMP AND PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY TO KEEP YOUR OPERATIONS RUNNING DAY TODAY. WHAT WE STRUGGLE WITH HIM MY LAST SLIDE IS? KIND OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF CURRENT LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS NETS WE NEED THIS KIND OF TRANSPARENCY LONGEVITY AND CERTAINTY AND WE'RE SEEING INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES OR LOAD SERVING ENTITIES FOR A BROADER TERM KIND OF SHY AWAY FROM SIGNING CONTRACTS IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE OUR PS. EXPANSION BECAUSE OF A POSSIBLE CARVE OUT AND WHETHER OR NOT TECHNOLOGIES PROCURED TODAY WILL BE ELIGIBLE OR INCLUDED. IN THOSE POLICIES MOVING FORWARD AND SO. I WOULD JUST. WE'RE SEEING THAT IN REAL TIME AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT CLIMATE CHANGE KIND OF ON HOLD WHILE WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT SO MAYBE. NO CONSIDERATION OF A GRACE PERIOD OF GRANDFATHERING FOR YOU KNOW THESE UTILITIES WHO ARE FORWARD LOOKING ENOUGH TO SIGN CONTRACTS IN THE LAST TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS -- WOULD CONTINUE TO ALLOW DEVELOPERS LIKE OR NOT TECHNOLOGIES TO MOVE PRODUCTS WILL. THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY IN THROUGH COMMITMENT TO THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES. I'M GONNA MISS PETER MILLER AND I'M REPRESENTING THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL TODAY. TOM I WANT TO START BY TAKING A LOOK AT WHERE WE'VE COME OVER THE PAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS. AB THIRTY TWO WAS PASSED TWELVE YEARS AGO WHEN IT SET AN AMBITIOUS TARGET FOR CLIMATE ACTION OF REDUCING OUR EMISSIONS TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS. BY. TWENTY TWENTY REALLY DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. AB ONE NEXT TO THE 33% ARE PS LEGISLATION. WAS PASSED NEARLY A DECADE AGO KNIT SOUTHERN AMBITIOUS GOAL OF GETTING A THIRD OF OUR ELECTRICITY FROM RENEWABLES BY. TWENTY TWENTY WE'RE GONNA DO MUCH BETTER THAN THAT. S. B. THREE FIFTY WAS PASSED A HANDFUL OF YEARS AGO AND IT'S AN AMBITIOUS TARGET A 50% WERE NOBLES BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND A DOUBLING OF OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY SAVINGS. WE'RE NOT ONLY ON TRACK TO MEET BOTH THOSE TARGETS BUT THE I'LL USE ARE ON TRACK TO MEET THE RENEWABLES TARGET A DECADE EARLY. PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD RAISE AT TARGET. AND CUT THE REMAINING FOSSIL GENERATION IN. TWENTY THIRTY BY NEARLY A QUARTER. WE'VE LACK LIKEWISE SAID AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR LOW CARBON FUELS VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION FOR ENERGY STORAGE. AND WE'RE ON TRACK ARE EXCEEDING. OR INCREASING OUR ROLES IN EVERY RESPECT. SO WHERE ARE WE TODAY. WE'RE NOBLES ARE CLEARLY THE LOW COST OPTION FOR NEW GENERATION CAPACITY. THE COMPETITIVE BIDS FOR NGUYEN CONSOLE IN THE RANGE OF TWO TO FOUR CENTS AND DROPPING. I I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T -- REFER TO THE PRESENTATIONMERELY PERFORMING WHERE YOU'VE HEARD OF IMPRESSIVE DECLINES IN THE COST OF NEW GEOTHERMAL GENERATION -- WHICH GIVES US AN ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT OPTION. BUT IN MANY CASES NEWER NOBLES ARE CHEAPER THAN EXISTING COAL PLANTS. THAT'S A HUGE TAIL WHEN FOR D. CARBON ISING THE GREAT. IT'S A HUGE TRANSFORMATION OF THE ENERGY SYSTEM THAT'S UNPARALLELED AND PROVIDES A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE. HONEST ON ON IN TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY. JUST ONE EXAMPLE LED LIGHTING IS THE NEW NORMAL. WHICH HAS ONE QUARTER THE CONSUMPTION OF INCANDESCENT LIGHTING AND LASTS TEN TIMES LONGER MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR CONSUMERS. AND MORE FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF APPLICATIONS [inaudible] LAMB. IN TERMS OF OUR CLIMATE POLICY WE HAVE AN AMBITIOUS GOAL IN PLACE FOR TWENTY THIRTY WE HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT THE MARKETPLACE PROGRAM TO GET THERE. ONLY MENTION THAT THE COST OF STORAGE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE DROPPING FAST. WITH EXPECTED FIRST COST BREAKEVEN FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES EXPECTED SOMETIME IN THE FIRST HALF THE NEXT DECADE. SO I DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE WORK THAT'S YET TO BE DONE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IT TO BE DONE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT WE CAN WE HAVE MADE EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE FOR AMBITIOUS. COMMITTED AND FOCUSED SO. WITH REMAINS HOW MUCH. ONE TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS IT REMAINS TO BE DONE WHERE THE KEY CHALLENGES AHEAD. FIRST OF ALL WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CARBONIZED IN THE ELECTRIC GRID. WE NEED HIGHER LEVELS OF RENEWABLES BOTH BEHIND AND IN FRONT OF THE MEDIA. WE NEED TO IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF THE GREAT IN GREAT MEASURE NOBLES YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY WE'RE SEEING A TRANSFORMATION OF THE GRIP OF A FOSSIL DOMINATED GRID. TO RENEWABLES GENERATES. AND THAT'S GOOD REQUIRE -- NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW APPROACHES TO GRID MANAGEMENT INCLUDING INCREASE STORAGE. IMPROVEMENTS IN DEMAND RESPONSE AND MANAGE CHARGING. AND A REGIONAL MARKET. REGIONAL MARKET IS CRITICAL BECAUSE ALLOWS US TO MAKE BEST USE OF THE EXISTING WERE NOBLES OF OUR GENERATION. TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING AND LOW COST RESOURCES FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. AT AS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY A COUPLE TIMES TODAY THE REASON MARKET WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY IN TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. IMPROVE OUR ACCOUNTING. SECOND WE NEED TO ACCELERATE OUR EFFORTS ENERGY EFFICIENCY NEED EXPANDED PROGRAMS WITH STATE WHAT COORDINATION. WE NEED TO BRING IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW PROGRAMMATIC APPROACHES. ENERGY EFFICIENCY WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR NOW ONLY LOWER EMISSIONS FOR KEEPING OUR COSTS LOW THAT'S CRITICAL TO CONTINUE TO GET CONSUMER SUPPORT. THIRD WE NEED TO DE CARBONIZED BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION. THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE INCREASED INVESTMENT -- DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES OF HEAT PUMPS OF LOW CARBON FUELS. AND FINALLY -- AND FAR FROM LEAST WE NEED TO REMEDY THE LEGACY OF POLLUTION AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND. AND EVERYONE ACROSS THE STATE BENEFITS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO SAY. THANK YOU HAVE GOT TO WORK. SPECIAL QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUES AT STEPPED OUT -- BASED ON THE PRIOR PANEL DISCUSSION AND IDEAS THAT WE SHARED -- BIOMASS AND THE CENTRAL PRECURE MEANT WONDERING WHO. GOT SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT WAY AND A BIT ON THAT. NOT ALL OF YOU COULD TAKE A STAB AT THE QUESTION THAT'S WHY. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A AN INITIAL STAB AT CENTRAL PROCUREMENT -- MANY THE CONCERN HERE AS HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON BY NUMBER THE PANELISTS. IS THAT WE ARE NOT SURE WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNDERTAKING LONG TERM PROCUREMENT ON BEHALF OF ALL CUSTOMERS THE UTILITIES. HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH THIS OBLIGATION AND THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT -- BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED UTILITIES ARE NOW NO LONGER WILLING TO UNDERTAKE LONG TERM CONTRACT COMMITMENTS UNLESS THEY HAVE A IRONCLAD ASSURANCES THAT THE COSTS CAN BE FULLY RECOVERED ON A NON BY PASSABLE BASIS FROM ALL CUSTOMERS. IN THEIR SERVICE TERRITORY. MEANWHILE WE HAVE NEW ENTRANTS COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS DIRECT ACCESS SUPPLIERS WHO DO NOT WANT THE UTILITIES TO BE BUYING ON THEIR BEHALF WOULD PREFER TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES -- THE P. YOU SEE IS SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE CHOICES THAT EVERY ENTITY WOULD LIKE TO PURSUE. TO ADD THEM UP AND TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE GAPS RELATIVE TO THE GOALS THAT THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED. IF THERE'S A GAP. THE P. YOU SEE IS SUPPOSED TO TRY TO ORDER SOMEBODY OR SOME COLLECTION OF ENTITIES TO GO OUT AND BUY THINGS. AND THIS IS A COMPLETELY UNTESTED MODEL SO FAR WE DON'T KNOW IF OR HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK. AND ONE ALTERNATIVE. IS FOR THE STATE TO IDENTIFY ENTITY WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IT MIGHT BE. TO DO THIS TYPE OF PROCUREMENT. THAT FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS WHEN YOU ADD UP THE COMBINED PREFERENCES OF ALL THE DIFFERENT LOAD SERVING ENTITIES. WHO MIGHT THIS ENTITY BE WHAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE? WE COULD USE THE UTILITIES. BUT THEY WOULD NEED THOSE IRONCLAD ASSURANCES OF COST RECOVERY. WE COULD DEPUTISE A THIRD PARTY ANY THAT WOULD BE CHARTERED ESSENTIALLY AS A PROCUREMENT ENTITY RESPONSIBLE THE STATE REGULATORS THAT COULD GO OUT AND UNDERTAKE THIS PROCUREMENT WITH COST RECOVERY AUTHORITY. WE COULD USE A STATE AGENCY -- WE TRIED THAT BEFOREWE HAD A MIXED RESULT BUT WE TRIED USING A STATE AGENCY THAT BEING THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIGGEST ENERGY CRISIS IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. IT'S HARD FOR THEM TO GET UP AND RUNNING QUICKLY. IF WE HAVE TIME. AND WE CAN PLAN THIS EFFORT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HAVE A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE STATE. INTO THESE TYPE OF COMMITMENTS AND MAYBE THERE ARE WAYS TO YOU STATE FINANCING TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF NEW PROJECTS. KEY WOULD BE THAT ANY CENTRALIZED PROCUREMENT MECHANISM HAS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER ALL THE COSTS AS BROADLY AS POSSIBLE FROM ALL MARKET PARTICIPANTS. SO I THINK THERE ARE WAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS. SOME MAY REQUIRE ENABLING LEGISLATION OTHERS COULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE P. YOU SEE. BUT THE KEY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. AND THAT WHATEVER GETS BOUGHT IS PART OF WHAT FALLS THROUGH THE CRACKS WHEN ALL OF THE LOAD SERVING ENTITIES PROPOSALS ARE PUT TOGETHER AND WE SEE WHAT'S MISSING. AND WHAT THE STATE STILL FEELS LIKE IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP THE OTHER. THE VISION LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON YEAH TO SO THE AGAIN HUNTER STERN -- WITH THE CODE CALIFORNIA COALITION HE TOLD EMPLOYEES SO I IN TERMS IT SUCH PROCUREMENT -- I THINK WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS TO FIRST START DATE HAVE EVERYBODY START FROM THE SAME. POINT OF VIEW WORKPLACE AND THAT IS OF THE CPU SEE -- IRP DE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING WE NEED A PLAN THE STATE NEED TO PLAN -- IT INNER IN ORDER TO ENSURE RESOURCE ADEQUACY. WE NEED A PLAN AND AGAIN SOME A LOAD SERVING ENTITIES ARE SUGGESTING THEY MAY OR MAY NOT. SPACE THAT PLAN. EVERYBODY HAVE TO PLAY IF IT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THE SAME PLAN -- WHAT MISTER FRIEDMAN SUGGEST WILL ACTUALLY BE THE NEXT MAJOR -- ENERGY CRISIS IN. BECAUSE WE WON'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY FOR WHEN WE NEED. SO THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL -- FROM A CENTRAL A THERE'S A FUNCTION OF COST OBVIOUSLY AND THERE'S ALSO -- A LAWSUIT WHICH IS BEING DEALT WITH -- IT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING -- WILDFIRE IN EXCESS FUEL -- SO I AGAIN THIS WOULD PROBABLY REQUIRE ANY LEGISLATIVE -- APPROACH -- IF. THE BALANCE OF REQUIREMENTS ARE NEEDS -- INCLUDE GREATER PROCUREMENT FROM BIOMASS RESOURCES -- THAT CERTAINLY AVAILABLE IT BUT AGAIN IT BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN. BUT I DON'T USE THE TERM ORGANICALLY -- IT'S NOT SOME THAT WILL HAPPEN WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR. THANK YOU. PLEASE [inaudible] NUANCE. SO -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID AYE I'D WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT NIGHT AND I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THE IRAQI IS CRITICAL IN TERMS OF CENTRALIZED PLANNING FOR PROCUREMENT. OF THE THE THREE UNDERPINNINGS TO THEY ARE P. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY KEY EITHER CRITICAL ITS RELIABILITY THE FOCUS ON RELIABILITY. THE FOCUS ON INTEGRATING RENEWABLE RESOURCES. I AND THE FINALS COST. MINIMIZATION YET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IT COST EFFECTIVELY -- AND AND ARRIVING AT THE OPTIMAL RESOURCE MIX BASED ON THOSE KEEP THREE KEY FACTORS -- IS IMPORTANT I TO PREVENT OF OPERATE HERE PRETTY PREVENT STRANDED ASSETS. WAS A STRANDED ASSETS WE PASSED ON TO RATEPAYERS. SO AGAIN PLANNING. OF WHILE THAT IS UNTESTED A HOUSE TO BE DONE IT IS IT'S VERY KEY AND WHAT THE COMMISSION IS. HAS SET FORTH -- WE THINK IS IS A GOOD. TO SEE KNOWN ELSE SAID IT WOULD ASK THE QUESTION WE KNOW. THAT THEM AT THE CORE OF YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN. LOOKING AT THESE VARIOUS DIFFERENT DATA. PROCUREMENT TAP PROCESSES OR FOR CENTRALIZED [inaudible] A MODEL. THAT WE THINK OF THE RATEPAYERS -- PERCIFORM MOST BUT WHAT OTHER ECONOMIC [inaudible] BENEFITS. COULD BE FACTORED IN AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THEM CLIMATE POLICIES AS TO TRY TO REDUCE JEEZ JEEZ I MEAN. ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT DE DO WE HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE USE AS A FORMULA ALREADY -- TO DETERMINE -- OTHER BIG ECONOMIC BENEFITS BEYOND -- RATEPAYERS -- SAVINGS. UP AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE IRP PROCESS CONSIDERS PRIORITIZING NUVEEN RENEWABLE AND OTHER RESOURCE PROJECTS. IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE WENT AND IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THOSE THREE FACTORS THAT I THAT I JUST MENTIONED -- THE IEP PROCESS CAN ALSO LEAD TO A ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND SUCH AS INCREASED JOBS -- AND MORE TAX REVENUE FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THOSE BENEFITS FLOW TO THE CUSTOMERS IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NOT JUST OUTSIDE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. OR IS GONNA BE PAYING PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO AS WE LOOK AT THE PLANS THAT ARE DO YOU ALL IN AUGUST. ANYONE ELSE WOULD. HELLO ALL JUST ADD THAT WE'VE GOT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY HERE THE DECREASE IN THE COST OF OUR NOBLE SAYS PROVIDES THE ABILITY TO PROPER PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR CONFLUENCE OF BENEFITS -- BY -- INVESTING ROBLES WE CAN LOWER THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AND REDUCE -- CRITERIA CLINTON EMISSIONS AND PROVIDE HEALTH BENEFITS AS WELL SO THERE'S STILL A TREMENDOUS -- ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS TO SOCIETY FROM REDUCING THE IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE -- BUT THERE CAN ALSO BE A LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS FROM APPROVED AIR QUALITY -- BY INVESTING IN REAL CASE. NEITHER CLOSING COMMENTS FROM ANY OF THE PANELISTS ON THIS SUBJECT TRIP. JUST A ONE FOLLOW UP ON THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM I JUST WANNA REALLY CAUTION -- MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE TO AYE TEMPER THEIR EXPECTATIONS IN THIS RESPECT -- WITH YOU SEE IS ACTUALLY TO HOLD ENTITIES TO DO IS. TO MEET GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS FOR THEIR PORTFOLIO. SHOW US THAT YOU HAVE A GHG EMISSIONS RATE ARM THAT IS AT A CERTAIN LEVEL. AND TELL US THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET THERE BY. TWENTY THIRTY I STARTED MY PRESENTATION BY POINTING OUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH GREENHOUSE GAS METRICS CAN BE GAMED AND MANIPULATED. TO PRODUCE RESULTS THAT ARE VERY CONTRARY TO WHAT POLICYMAKERS MIGHT ANTICIPATE. FOR EXAMPLE I MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD SIMPLY SAY WE'RE GONNA BUY A BUNCH OF EXISTING NORTHWEST HYDRO. WERE DONE WE MET THE GREENHOUSE GAS TARGETS -- BUT PROVIDER MIGHT SAY WE DON'T WE'RE GONNA NEED A LOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TARGET BY BUYING SURPLUS NUCLEAR POWER FROM THE PALLAVA THE NUCLEAR PLANT IN ARIZONA THAT'S ZERO CARBON. WERE DONE. DON'T EXPECT THAT A GREENHOUSE GAS SPACE TARGET IS GOING TO PRODUCE INVESTMENT IN NEW RESOURCES IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE THESE ARE DIFFERENT APPROACHES DIFFERENT METRICS. AND IT'S MY VIEW THAT WE NEED TO BE FOCUSED NOT ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ON A STANDALONE BASIS BUT ON DRIVING INVESTMENT IN NEW FACILITIES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE GET. INCREMENTAL AND ADDITIONAL RESULTS THAT MAKE THE WORLD ARE ESSENTIALLY THAT ALLOW US TO HAVE A CLEANER GRID THAT LEAD TO REAL GREEDY CARBONIZATION AND DON'T JUST PRODUCE AN ACCOUNTING EXERCISE THAT MAKES US FEEL LIKE WE GOT A CLEANER GRADE. WHEN LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGING [inaudible] IT COMES [inaudible] WHO KNOWS? YEAH I'M JUST ELDERS HAD BRIEFLY TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MISTER FREEMAN JUST SAID -- THE IN THE NEW PROJECTS ALSO IT WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK YOU ASKED ABOUT ECONOMIC BENEFITS. PEOPLE WORKING PROVIDE ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE THANK YOU STOP. I CHAIRMAN I WOULD JUST SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I THINK YOU KNOW. THESE ARE THE EXACT QUESTIONS THAT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE ASKING AT THIS TIME AND AND WHILE SUMMER I THINK DISCOURAGED ABOUT IT I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING DISCUSSION. AND YOU KNOW EVEN YOUR PROCUREMENT QUESTION I MEAN IS. ONE THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN MULTIPLE STATES -- I WAS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN NEVADA AND WE HAD AN IRP. AND WE ALSO HAD A VERY DIFFERENT -- UTILITY STRUCTURE THAN YOU HAVE IN CALIFORNIA FAR LESS DIVERSE AND AND YOU KNOW A FRACTION OF THE SIZE AND SO. AT WHAT LEVEL DO YOU LOOK AT THAT PROCUREMENT IS AND YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE HAVING IN YEARS NO EASY ANSWER BUT I THINK -- YOU'RE GONNA GET YOU KNOW A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE -- I THINK RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGIES ARE RESILIENT AND WILL LOOK TO DEVELOP THESE PROJECTS AND DEVELOP NEW PROJECTS AND I THINK THERE ARE MANY DEVELOPERS WHO WOULD BE YOU KNOW WHO COULD SIT RIGHT HERE AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT. THAT THE DESIRE TO BUILD NEW PROJECTS TO GROW THEIR COMPANIES -- AND INVEST IN CALIFORNIA THE STOCK MARKET DOESN'T LOOK A KINDLY ON COMPANIES THAT JUST SHUFFLE WHERE THEIR MEGAWATTS ARE COMING FROM FROM FROM DIFFERENT AREAS AND SO FORTH SO -- YOU KNOW WE CAN WORK IN THOSE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES WHATEVER THEY MAY BE AS LONG AS WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE CLARITY ON WHAT WE WANT TO DO MOVING FORWARD. AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND THANK YOU TO ALL FIVE VIEW FOR SPEND SOME TIME WITH US AND ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL. BE CALLING UP THE NEXT STEP PANEL. NOW WE HAVE CAN CAUSE WOULD SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. MICHAEL CURRY LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. IN MELISSA BRENT EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY THAT COULD. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME I'M TOLD THAT THINK TO OF OUR CENTERS ARE STILL TIED UP ON RED CARPET THE DATA. THEY'RE WATCHING STAFF SEARED. REALLY APPRECIATE THEM TAKEN THE TIME TO PARTICIPATE. AB FEEL FREE YOU -- GET STARTED THAT MR CAN CAUSE. YES THANK YOU CAN'T BECAUSE WITH SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY. OF THE BACKROOM MATERIALS POSE THREE QUESTIONS BECAUSE WERE NOT A DEVELOPER OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES I WILL SKIP OVER THAT ONE AND JUST FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE OTHER. TO THE FIRST QUESTION RAISES THE ISSUE OF BARRIERS S. MISSIONS AN EARLIER PANEL TALKED ABOUT. THE USE OF MARKET PURCHASES AND IMPORTS. BASED ON TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NUMBERS -- WE SEE HALF OF THE PROVIDERS THAT REPORT POWER CONTENT LITTLE INFORMATION TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAD OVER 40% OF THE RESOURCE COMING FROM. SUCH PURCHASES UNSPECIFIED POWERS NOT SURE WHERE THOSE NUMBERS CAME FROM. BUT FOR US THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT. ISSUE WITH REPORTING OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOME UNSPECIFIED PARA BUT AS YOU REDUCE THAT NUMBER AND GET FROM SOURCES DIRECTLY. THAT SHOULD HELP IN DEALING WITH THOSE ISSUES -- I'D ALSO POINT OUT JUST. FOR GIGGLES I GUESS ON THE POWER CONTENT LABEL WE KNOW THAT THERE'S STILL FIFTEEN OF THE SEVENTY REPORTING UTILITIES PROVIDING POWER TO THEIR CUSTOMERS FROM COAL RESOURCES. SWEEPING VETS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT ISSUE SPECIAL IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT NO COLD BILL WAS PASSED OVER A DECADE AGO. THE SECOND QUESTION RISEN BACK FROM MATERIALS FOCUSED ON HOW THE CHANGES IN IN A CHIU PROCUREMENT CREATE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES. IN OUR VIEW THERE ARE TWO KEY CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THEM TODAY. THE FIRST WHICH RELATES TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF LOAD FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AND THE SECOND IS ALLOCATION OF COSTS TO THOSE. NEW PROVIDERS OF SERVICE. IN MAY OF LAST YEAR THE CPUC ISSUED A STAFF WHITE PAPER ON CUSTOMER IN RETAIL CHOICE WITH EVOLVING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK. IN THAT REPORT THEY NOTED 85% OF RETAIL LOAD COULD BE SERVED BY OTHER PROVIDERS THEN THE I USED BY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR THE CHAIRMAN OF CC IN THE PRESIDENT OF THE P. UC JOINTLY WROTE A LETTER TO THEM PRO TEM DE LEóN. WHERE THEY STATED THAT IT WAS NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE I. O. U.'S COULD LOSE 6290% WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS? AND THEN FINALLY IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR THE SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. WHERE THEY NOTED 80% OF THE LOAD SO ONE OF THE PREVIOUS WITNESSES TALKED ABOUT 80%? THINK THAT'S PRETTY FAIR EIGHTY EIGHTY FIVE THEM UP TO NINETY FROM. THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS IN THE LAST YEAR -- THIS UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FORECAST POWER NEEDS AND FUTURE AND MAKE PROCUREMENT DECISIONS BASED THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND YOUR CONSTITUENTS. AND ARE RELATIVELY SMALL SERVICE TERRITORY OF SINGLE GOVERNMENTAL JURISDICTION COULD DEPART AND THAT WOULD BE 40% OF OUR LOAD VIRTUALLY OVERNIGHT. THE SECOND COMPLICATING FACTORS ALLOCATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPARTING WITH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS SHIFTING OF COSTS SERVED BY CCA UNBUNDLED CUSTOMERS IN MY YOU. BUT THAT IS NOT YET BEEN ADDRESSED THE LAWS CLEAR MOST RECENTLY THROUGH S. B.. THREE FIFTY WHICH STATES BUNDLE CUSTOMERS STILL NOT EXPERIENCING SORT OF RETAIL CUSTOMER PROVIDE. SWITCHING PROVIDERS THAT WE BELIEVE THIS ISSUE MUCH MUST BE ADDRESSED IN THE VERY SHORT TERM. A NOTHER ISSUE WE POINT OUT EVERY YEAR LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT PROCUREMENT MANDATES -- MANDATES ONLY EXACERBATE THE SITUATION WE'D SUGGEST THAT BEFORE ANY ADDITIONAL MANDATES MOVE FORWARD. BUT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE P. YOU SEE TO TAKE ACTION ON THESE ON THESE ISSUES -- WE ALSO KNOW THAT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT EQUITABLE RULES GOVERNING ENERGY PROCUREMENT THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY. OF PERFORMANCE STILL VARIES GREATLY. HISTORICALLY LEGISLATURE'S RELIED ON VESTRON UTILITIES TO ACHIEVE VARIOUS PUBLIC. POLICY OBJECTIVES WHEN THERE'S A B. THIRTY TWO OUR PS WHILE EXEMPTING OTHER PROVIDERS FOR MANY OF THE OTHER SMALLER MANDATES WE THINK THAT SHOULD CHANGE. TALK EARLIER ABOUT THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT ENTITY. WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT ENTITY WE SUGGESTED IN COMMENTS BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT THE I SO MIGHT BE SUCH AN ENTITY. THE COULD DO THAT. A IN MAY OF THIS YEAR THE P. YOU SEE ISSUED A DRAFT GREEN BOOK THAT TALKED ABOUT THESE KINDS OF ISSUES -- IN A COVER LETTER TO THAT REPORT PRESIDENT PICKER NOTED QUOTE IN THE LAST DE REGULATION WE HAD A PLAN HOWEVER FLAWED NOW AS WE ARE DEREGULATING ELECTRIC MARKETS TO DOZENS OF DIFFERENT DECISIONS AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS. BUT WE DO NOT HAVE A PLAN. BEFORE NOT CAREFUL WE CAN DRIFT INTO ANOTHER CRISIS. WE SUPPORT THOSE COMMENTS AND THINK WE DO NEED A PLAN AND WE NEED TO QUICKLY -- ALSO ONE THAT TO GET INTO MORE THE CENTRAL PROCUREMENT AND CITY IN OUR COMMENTS ON THE GREEN BOOK AND THE TESTIMONY OF THE NONVIOLENT -- WE SUGGEST WE COULD SUPPORT THAT. IT CAN BE NXT THAT DEALS WITH RELIABILITY PROCUREMENT AND ALSO MANDATE PROCUREMENT BECAUSE OF THE FRACTURED STATE OF PROCUREMENT AT PRESENT TIME OF THEM. FINALLY I WOULD NOTE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT S. B. THREE FIFTY REQUIRED THE AYE AYE USED TO DEVELOP INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANS WE THINK THOSE PLANS SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME TO WORK -- DOES A RELATIVELY NEW WERE FILING UPDATES AUGUST FIRST. AND WE THINK THOSE SHOULD BE GIVEN TIME TO WORK AND THEY SHOULD BE INTEGRATED WITH CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. MEET THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND THAT RESOURCES CAN BE COMPARED TO THE MARKET -- AND WITH FEDERAL IN MY COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RAY COKER ON THE SENIOR ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER FOR THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TALK ABOUT -- LOS ANGELES AND SOME OF THE EXCITING THINGS HAPPEN I THINK YOU HAVE THE PRESENTATION IN FRONT OF YOU IT ON PAGE SO THAT TO I I'D LIKE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT DWP. LARGEST PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY IN THE COUNTRY WE SERVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION CUSTOMER. CUSTOMER METERS ARE ABOUT FOUR MILLION ANGELENOS. AND WE HAVE ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND MILES OF TRANSMISSION WE ARE NOT IN THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR BALANCING AUTHORITY WE ARE OWN BALANCING AUTHORITY THAT ALSO INCLUDE. THE CITIES OF GLENDALE AND BURBANK. MOVING ON A SLIGHT THREE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE GREAT RENEWABLE EFFORTS WE'VE MADE WE HAVE RESOURCES WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF A SMALL HYDRO AS WELL AS GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE ARE VERY DIVERSE SUPPLY REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE WESTERN STATES. WE ARE SUPPORT OF A GEOTHERMAL BUT WE HAVE TO WE HAVE OF SPECIFIC ISSUES. WITH -- MANDATES IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE TRANSMISSION TO BE ABLE TO BRING IT HOME TO OUR SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS. MOVING ON TO SLIDE FOR WE ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF WHEN RESOURCES ABOUT A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS LOCATED IN FIVE WESTERN STATES. MOVING ON THE SLY FIVE WE HAVE -- ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR INCLUDING OVER THREE HUNDRED MEG ABOUT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MEGA WATTS WITH IN THE LA BASIN. AS WELL AS ON UTILITY SCALE THINK IN CALIFORNIA AND NEVADA. SLIDE SIX THREE SHOWS OUR EFFORTS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE HAD A 73% INCREASE IN OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIOS -- THESE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE LONG TERM COMMITMENTS ON AS WELL AS MORE THAT ARE COMING ONLINE IN THE FUTURE -- IT IN ADDITION ONE OF THE INNOVATIVE THINGS HAPPENING AND LOS ANGELES WE HAVE A FOR A FIRST OF A KIND STUDY WE BELIEVE FOR A LARGE. UTILITY LOOKING AT A 100% WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO GET TO A 100% FOR LOS ANGELES WHAT TYPE OF COMMITMENTS WHAT TYPE OF INVESTMENTS. IT SO TROUBLING BARRIERS ARE THERE FOR US TO GET THERE IT IS A ABOUT A TWO YEAR STUDY PROCESS WERE ABOUT HALF WAY THERE IT'S VERY STAKEHOLDER -- INVOLVED WE HAVE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY INVOLVED WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS WE HAVE CUT LARGE CUSTOMERS IT'S A DIVERSE GROUP THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE ALSO HAVE LARGE HYDRO WE HAVE IN ADDITION TO OUR BUT FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT ENTITLEMENT WHO FOR ONE OF OUR CROWN JEWELS IS THE TWELVE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MEGAWATT CASTAIC -- LARGE HYDRO A PUMPED STORAGE THE UTILITY A SUPPORTED ENERGY STORAGE SINCE THE SEVENTIES. THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE IT HOUSE YOU CAN SEE THE PIPELINES OR THE PENSTOCKS COMING DOWN AND ESSENTIALLY. ONE ENERGY IS ABUNDANT USE THAT WE THAT ENERGY FROM THE LOWER WATER RESERVOIR TO IT UPPER RESERVE MORE. AND ONE ENERGIES EXPENSIVE OR WHEN YOU NEED IT FOR EVENING RAMPS YOU JUST GRAVITY FEED THAT THROUGH THE PIPES TO RUN A GENERATOR AND PUMP TURBINE TO CREATE ENERGY. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE WE ALSO HAVE UTILITY SCALE BATTERY STORAGE WE JUST COMMISSION THIS MONTH TWENTY MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY STORAGE. IN OUR RENEWABLE CORRIDOR THAT WHERE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE RESOURCES. MOVING ON TO SLIDE NINE WE ALSO HAVE BEHIND THE METER AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT WE HAD FIRE STATION TWENTY EIGHT RIGHT IN THE ONLY SO CANYON AREA WHERE. THEY INSTALL WE INSTALLED A BATTERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS SOLAR ON THE ROOFS AND TWO WEEKS AFTER COMMISSIONING THERE WAS AN OUTAGE. THEY HAVE A DIESEL GENERATOR BUT BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THEY WERE ABLE TO RUN THROUGH THAT FOUR HOUR OUTAGE WITHOUT FIRING UP THERE DIESEL GENERATOR AND WITHOUT LOSING ANY CRITICAL LOADS. MOVING ON TO SLIDE HIM ONE OF THE OTHER INNOVATIVE PROCESS -- STORAGE PROJECTS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS COMPRESSED AIR THERE IS -- ONLY TO PROJECTS IN THE WORLD THAT WE'RE AWARE OF BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE TO YOU SHE'LL FOR THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GROUND UNDERNEATH. SO ESSENTIALLY ON THIS WOULD BE A UTILITY SCALE PROJECT THOUGHT YOU WOULD WHEN THERE'S ABUNDANT ENERGY YOUR OVERSUPPLY YOU USE -- YOU COMPRESS THE AIR INTO THE SALT CAVERNS UNDERGROUND. AND WHEN YOU NEED THE ENERGY YOU RUN IT THROUGH AN EXPANDER TO PULL THE AIR OUT AND RUN A GENERATOR TO CREATE. TO IT TO USE IT WHEN YOU NEED IT -- THIS LAW A SMALL HUNDRED SIXTY MEGAWATT PILOT PROGRAM. PROJECT FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT BUT ON THIS LOCATION COULD BE FIFTEEN HUNTER TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. NAM CAPABILITY ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES -- AYE AYE I CALL THIS LIKE A TALE OF TWO SEASONS ONE SLIDE ELEVEN ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE IT SHOWS. OF SPRING DAY IN LA WHERE WE HAD FAIRLY LOW LOADS TWENTY SIX HUNDRED MEG BOMB MEGAWATT PEAK. WE SERVED UP 74% OF OUR NEEDS THAT DAY WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY. CONTRAST THAT WITH OF SLIGHT ON THE RIGHT WHERE WE HAD OUR PEAK DAY LAST SUMMER WE BEAT OUR PRIVATE PRE PRIOR PEAK BY OVER A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WE HAD SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATT PEAK. ONLY 15% OF THE ENERGY SUPPLIED THAT DAY WAS WITH RENEWABLES SO FOR THAT DAY TO SCALE UP 21100% WOULD REQUIRE A FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF RENEWABLES I JUST WENT THROUGH OUR PROJECT LISTING. TO GET TO A SPRING DAY. THAT OVER PROCUREMENT IS SIGNIFICANT TO HARM A LARGE AMOUNT OF OUR CUSTOMERS. ONCE LIKE TWELVE WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE MEANT MENTIONED THE DOT CURVE TODAY SO THIS IS ACTUALLY LA DWP IS LIEU DOCKER MON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH OF THIS YEAR. AND YOU CAN SEE YOU SEE VERY WELL THAT GREEN DOC. HE ALSO SEE THE HUMP BACK ON THE DOCK I MENTIONED THE CASTAIC POWER PROG POP PUNK TIGER PROJECT SO THAT'S WHEN WE HAD TOO MUCH ENERGY. AND WE USE THAT TO PUMP THROUGH THE GENERATOR AND THE PUMP THE WATER UP TILL BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE THE BLUE AREAS WE ACTUALLY USE THE GENERATORS -- TO TO HELP WITH THE DOCKER FOR THE EVENING. ON SLIDE THIRTEEN WE HAVE WHAT OUR TARGETS ARE IN OUR MOST RECENT STRATEGIC LONG TERM RESOURCE PLAN WHAT ARE OUR RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD GOALS FAR AS WELL AS LAST TUESDAY. OUR BOARD APPROVED A MORE AGGRESSIVE PLAN AND A 5% TO EACH THE TARGETS OF THE SCENARIO IN OUR NEXT. LONG TERM STRATEGIC LONG TERM RESOURCE PLAN THAT WILL KICK OFF. ON NEXT YEAR MOVING ANDI'S FOURTEEN ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS WE HAVE TO HIGH LEVELS OF RENEWABLE IS TRANSMISSION. THAT FIRST SLIDE WE TALKED ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION THE LA HOUSE OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MECHAS MILES OF TRANSMISSION. WE HAVE TWO MAIN ARTERIES TO BRING IN. RESOURCES -- SO ARE WE LOOK TO LOCATE RENEWABLES IN THOSE SPECIFIC AREAS BUT AS IMPORTANT PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANT TO BRING IT TO LA WE HAVE A HUNDRED YEAR OLD SYSTEM ON A GRID THAT WAS NOT. BUILT FOR TODAY'S ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SO THERE'S A LOT OF DOWNSTREAM UPGRADES THAT ALSO NEED TO BE -- IMPLEMENTED BEFORE WE CAN REALLY REACH HIGH LEVELS OF RENEWABLE SO INCREASING OR IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE REGULATORY. ARM PROCESSES TO STREAMLINE TRANSMISSION WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. ON SLIDE FIFTEEN THESE OR SOME OF THE RESOURCES WE LOOKED CARE WHEN WE LOOK AT THROUGH THE WESTERN STATES AND WHERE WE HAVE TRANSMISSION OR WHAT'S. WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHEN THE AND THERE IS AN ABUNDANT SUPPLY. OF DEVELOPER CAPABILITY AND PROJECTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE -- TO AT LEAST FOR LA'S PERSPECTIVE ON IN THESE SPECIFIC AREAS SO WE DON'T SEE A BARRIER OTHER THAN TRANSMISSION OF BEING ABLE TO INCREASE HIGHER LEVELS. ON SLIDE ELEVEN ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE SEE IMPROVING ALL CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS DWP IS THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET THIS MARKET -- PROVIDES EXCEPTIONAL BENEFITS AND IN TERMS OF D. CARBON ICING THE GRID -- REDUCE THE INTEGRATION COSTS REDUCE THE RATE CURTAIL MAN'S IT'S MORE EFFICIENT DISPATCH OF RESOURCES ON WIRED WIDER FOOTPRINT REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES INCREASING. FLEXIBILITY BUT IMPORTANTLY IT'S A VOLUNTARY MARKET FOR PARTICIPATION FOR OTHER IT UP ENTITIES NOT IN A CRISIS. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS ONE OF THE ANOTHER UNIQUE THING THAT IS HAPPENING IN LA. WE HAVE LIKE I MENTIONED FOUR MILLION ANGELENOS. 40% OF THOSE ARE IN DISADVANTAGED COMMIT THE COMMUNITIES OR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES SO THIS IS THE WAY THIS IS CALLED OUR EQUITY METRICS DATA INITIATIVE MINUTES AWAY FOR PROGRAM MANAGERS. AND POLICY MAKERS TO ASSESS HOW DWP IS MEETING THE CONSTITUENT NEEDS OF ENTIRE SURFACE TERRITORY SO YOU CAN PUT THIS ON IT. INCOME SCREEN YOU CAN PUT IT ON ZIP CODE SCREEN. IN THIS PARTICULAR ONE WE LOOKED AT OUR SOLAR INCENTIVE PROGRAM SO IF IT'S THE SOLAR INTENSITY IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF KILOWATTS. IN A SPECIFIC ZIP CODE DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER REST FOR ALL RESIDENTS IT'LL TELL YOU HOW MUCH SOLAR IS -- PENETRATED THAT AREA YOU CAN SEE ON THE WEST SIDE THERE'S A LOT OF SOLAR BUT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE WHERE ARE EACH DAY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE. VERY TOUGH TO REACH CONSTITUENCIES A CONSTITUENCY SO IF SOMETHING WERE -- FOCUSED ON BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM TODAY. POLICIES WERE MAKING FROM AN ENERGY PERSPECTIVE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO IMPACT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN PAY OUR BILLS WHETHER OR NOT WE GO OUT TO DINNER. NEXTMONTH BUT THAT SINGLE MOTHER IN BOYLE HEIGHTS THAT'S WORKING THREE JOBS TO JUST MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T EXPAND THE HOMELESS POPULATION. DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY ARE VERY IMPACTFUL SO TO BE ABLE TO DO. ARE PLANNING. WITH STABILITY BUT FLEXIBILITY WHERE WE KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS AND LETTING US GET THERE IN THE MOST. EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE WAY FOR THESE CONSTITUENTS IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. FINALLY WHERE ARE WE FROM A GREENHOUSE GAS PERSPECTIVE. WHEN WE LOOK AT -- CALIFORNIA'S GOAL THE 40% BE BELOW TWENTY THIRTY WE HIT THAT FOURTEEN YEARS EARLY WE HIT THAT LAST YEAR. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NEXT GOLD TWENTY FIFTY YOU CAN SEE THE BOTTOM LINE THE BROWN DOTTED LINE THAT'S THE GOAL AND YOU CAN SEE BY. WE ANTICIPATE HITTING THAT GOAL AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS EARLIER THAN WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO WE THINK WE WILL HIT THAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS NOW REDUCING MESS. SO WE THINK WE WILL HIT THAT BY. TWENTY THIRTY I HAVE A COUPLE MORE SLIDES A TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND SO ARE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET THOSE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND EQUALLY APPLY OUR BENEFITS THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND WITHOUT IP IF ON IT. HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK HERE TODAY MY NAME'S MELISSA BRANTON I'M WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY WHICH IS A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATOR OR CC A SO I WANTED TO LEAVE YOU WITH ONE KEY TAKEAWAY UP FRONT FOR MY PRESENTATION TODAY AND THAT IS THAT. CCA'S ARE A TOOL IN THE STATE'S TOOLKIT AS IT CONTINUES DOWN THE PATH TO D. CARBONIZATION AND IN FACT THEY GO A STEP FURTHER AND SAY CCA'S ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS TRANSITION TO A CARBON FREE STATE. AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH BOTH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS WITH THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS TOGETHER. SO AB THIRTY TWO SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED THE A A RP TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTARY ACTION TO LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SUBSEQUENT ARB SCOPING PLANS HAVE CONSISTENTLY IDENTIFIED VOLUNTARY ACTION BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND COMMUNITIES TO DE CARBONIZED AS ESSENTIAL TO OUR CHURCH ACHIEVING OUR COLLECTIVE GOALS. AND SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE FORMED CCA'SAS THE WAY TO COMPLY WITH THEIR AGGRESSIVE CLIMATE ACTION PLANS CCA'S HAVE REALLY BEEN THE VEHICLE THROUGH WHICH OUR LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES CAN ACHIEVE THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. AND THEY'VE DONE THIS THROUGH A FEW DIFFERENT MECHANISMS ONE IS DEFAULT ENERGY SUPPLY OFFERINGS THAT HAVE HIGHER RENEWABLES. AND HIGHER CHICHI FREE ENERGY CONTENT WELL AHEAD OF STATE MANDATES -- A SECOND IS DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS TO INCREASE ADOPTION OF E. VIS. THIRD DEVELOPMENT OF BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAMS TO GET DE CARBONIZED THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. AND FOURTH DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THAT FILL GAPS IN BROADER UTILITY ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM OFFERINGS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS HE CA IS GOVERNED IN THE CONTEXT OF MEASURING SUCCESSES IN RESULTS CCA GOVERNANCE IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF A PUBLIC OWN UTILITY. BOARDS OF A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS GOVERN OTHER CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SUCH AS BRIDGES WATER SYSTEMS PORTS TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS AND THEY'RE WELL EQUIPPED TO GOVERN THE SUPPLY OF ELECTRICITY AS WELL. WE ARE PUBLIC AGENCIES WITH OPEN TRANSPARENT DECISION MAKING CONDUCTED AND PUBLIC MEETINGS AND SUBJECT TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. SO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY AS WE ARE A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY SET UP TO SUPPLY ELECTRICITY TO ALAMEDA COUNTY AND ELEVEN OF ITS MEMBER CITIES. AND AT FULL LAUNCH WILL HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS. AS OF JUNE FIRST WE BEGAN SERVING MUNICIPAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WHICH IS ABOUT HALF OF OUR LOAD. WILL BEGIN SERVING RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AS OF NOVEMBER FIRST AND AT FULL LAUNCH WILL BE THE LARGEST CCA AND P. GENIES SERVICE TERRITORY. OUT THE DOOR WE'VE OFFERED CUSTOMERS A CHOICE OF TWO PRODUCTS ONE IS AN 85% CARBON FREE PRODUCT WHICH IS ALSO 38% RENEWABLE ENERGY. AT A ONE POINT 5% DISCOUNT TO THE INCUMBENT UTILITIES PRICES THE SECOND IS A 100% CARBON FREE PRODUCT 40% RENEWABLE AND AT THE SAME PRICE POINT AS THE INCUMBENT UTILITY. WERE ALSO DEVELOPING A 100% RENEWABLE PRODUCT AT A PRICE PREMIUM FOR OUR CUSTOMERS BY THE RESIDENTIAL LAUNCH. I WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE CLAIM THAT MISTER FRIEDMAN SAID IN THE LAST PANEL WHICH WAS THAT THE CLAIMS OF CARBON FREE OR CARBON REDUCE PRODUCTS ARE UNVERIFIABLE. WE WOULD SAY ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERIFIABLE AND WE'RE LOOKING TO USE A WELL RESPECTED AND REPUTABLE THIRD PARTY VERIFIER SUCH AS THE CLIMATE REGISTRY TO VERIFY OUR GREENHOUSE GAS CLAIMS. AND THE UTILITIES TO THE SAME -- I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT THROUGH ARE MULTIFACETED EFFORTS AT EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY TOWARDS DE CARBONIZATION. ALTHOUGH WE ONLY LAUNCHED IN JUNE WE'VE ALREADY LAUNCHED A DEMAND RESPONSE PILOT WHICH REWARDS ARE LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS FOR SHIFTING THEIR USAGE AWAY FROM PEAK TIMES. AND WE EXPECT TO EXPAND THESE TYPES A CUSTOMER DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAMS OVER TIME AS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO DE CARBONIZATION INVOLVES SHIFTING CUSTOMER USAGE IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS TUCKER CONCERNS. WERE ALSO MAKING USE OF SMART METER DATA AND WE'RE ANALYZING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE PROGRAMS USING THE GRANULARITY OF THE HOURLY DATA THAT WE HAVE FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR ENERGY PROCUREMENT GOALS TO REMAIN AT LEAST 5% ABOVE THE STATE'S OUR PS REQUIREMENT. AND WE EXPECT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO EXCEED THIS GOAL OVER TIME TO DEVELOPING MORE AGGRESSIVE RENEWABLE ANDY CARBONIZATION GOALS EXCEEDING STATE TARGETS. AND IN THIS VEIN WE RECENTLY LAUNCHED A SOLICITATION FOR UP TO ONE MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS PER YEAR OF LONG TERM RENEWABLE ENERGY CITED IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE ALONG WITH PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY WERE JUST AWARDED A GRANT FROM OUR LOCAL AIR DISTRICT. TO ENHANCE LOCAL RESILIENCY BY INSTALLING SOLAR PLUS STORAGE ON CRITICAL FACILITIES SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND FIRE STATIONS. THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF BOTH DEEP HARMONIZING AND PROVIDING OTHER LOCAL RESILIENCY BENEFIT. AND AS MENTIONED -- BY -- OUR AIM TO SERIZAWA AYE WE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND TO HELP THEM SOLVE THEIR LOCAL AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS BY WORKING WITH THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION UTILITY PGA ME. ON A JOINT SOLICITATION IN THE OAKLAND AREA TO ME A LOCAL GRADE RELIABILITY NEED. THIS IS A REAL FIRST OF ITS KIND PARTNERSHIP. CA AND WE WILL BE BUYING CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTS FROM NEW PROJECTS THROUGH TEN PLUS YEAR PPS. THAT WILL CREATE -- CONTRIBUTE TO SEVERAL LOCAL BENEFITS CREATION OF NEW CLEAN ENERGY THAT DOES NOT HAVE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTANTS. TO HELP AIR QUALITY IN THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES NEARBY -- CREATION OF LOCAL JOBS AND LOCAL INVESTMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND ENHANCED RELIABILITY AND THE OAKLAND AREA WITHOUT THAT DISRUPTED NEED FOR NEW TRANSMISSION LINES OR ADDITIONAL FOSSIL GENERATION. AND WE HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE A PROVED TO BE A REPLICABLE MODEL THAT WE CAN TAKE TO OTHER AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- WE'VE ALSO UNDERTAKEN A YEAR LONG PLANNING EFFORT TO DEVELOP A FIRST OF ITS KIND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN AND IT'S A FIVE YEAR ROAD MAP. THAT ALLOWS US -- TO FIND EARLY ACTION INITIATIVES IN THE EARLY STAGES TO ADEQUATELY BENEFIT ALL OF OUR CUSTOMER CLASSES LOCALLY. CECE'S GENERALLY AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALONE ARE ON TRACK FOR MORE THAN A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW LONG TERM PROCUREMENT EIGHT ACTIVITIES STATEWIDE. CCA'S ARE RESPONDING TO THE SOLAR INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT CLIP. WE'RE COGNIZANT OF THE CURRENT RENEWABLES AND THE NEED FOR NEW GENERATION AND WE ARE INVESTING. CCA'S HAVE SPENT TWO POINT FIVE BILLION. IN CONSTRUCTION OF CALIFORNIA RENEWABLES AND THE MAJORITY OF SPENDING ON THE PROJECTS ARE WITH PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS. AND ALL OF THE APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THIRTY SIX MEGAWATTS OF IN STATE RENEWABLE PROJECTS CONTRACTED APPROXIMATELY 89% ARE SUPPORTED BY LONG TERM CONTRACTS MORE THAN TEN YEARS. SO CONTRARY TO CLAIMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MADE EARLIER CCA'S ARE INVESTING. IN CALIFORNIA. IN LONG TERM CONTRACTS TO CREATE NEW RENEWABLE GENERATION. IT'S HISTORICALLY TAKEN ABOUT THREE TO FOUR YEARS FOR AN OPERATING CCA TO CREATE A DIVERSE AND LONG TERM PORTFOLIO. BUT THIS TIME FRAME IS ACCELERATING. AND WE'RE IN A TIME OF TRANSITION WHERE THERE'S AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF NEW CCA'S THAT HAVE RECENTLY LAUNCHED DURING THE PROCESS OF FORMING. IT'S A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE IN TERMS OF D. CARBONIZATION. WE'RE SEEKING THIS PARTNER WAS STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND PROMOTING THE TRANSITION TO BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION WERE WORKING WITH OUR OWN LOCAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING DEPARTMENTS ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. AND WE'VE REALLY BECOME AN ENERGY HUB FOR POLICY WE ARE THE EXPERTS THAT CAN BRIDGE BETWEEN OUR LOCALITIES AND THEIR LOCAL INITIATIVES IN FUNDING. AND THE STATE AGENCIES AS THEY SEEK TO IMPLEMENT STATE CLIMATE GOALS WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT RE DESIGNED AS A TOOL THAT CAN HELP SHIFT CUSTOMER LOAD AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT SEE SEIZE ARE NIMBLE AND WE CAN MOVE FAST TO RESPOND AND PUSH THE ENVELOPE ON D. CARBONIZATION EFFORTS. THROUGH NEW PILOTS NEW TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE CAN BRING PROGRAMS TO SCALE WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A LONG AND COMPLEX REGULATORY PROCESS TO PLAY OUT BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN TO ACT IN THE INTERESTS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND THIS IS PRIMARILY BECAUSE AS GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WE ARE PROFIT DRIVEN ARE CONFLICTED BETWEEN CUSTOMER AND SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS. WE CAN IDENTIFY THE NEED WITH OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND IMMEDIATELY CRAFT A SOLUTION. AT THE SAME TIME ARE PARTNERING WITH STATE AGENCIES SUCH AS THE CPUC TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S ON TRACK TO MEET ITS CARBON GOALS. TO THIS AND EACH CCA'S DEVELOPING THIS INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN THAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING SO MUCH ABOUT BY AUGUST FIRST. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PLANS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EACH CCA TO CONSIDER AND DISCUSS WITH THEIR BOARDS AND COMMUNITIES THE BEST PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES TO ADOPT GOING FORWARD. THE CPC WILL ENSURE THE COLLECTIVE ACTION IS TAKING THE STATE WHERE IT NEEDS TO GO. WE'RE PROUD TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND WE EXPECT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO OUR EFFORTS BY OUR COMMUNITIES BY OUR STATE AGENCIES AND BY YOU. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CHALLENGES AND OUR WORK AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL THREE OF YOU [inaudible] AS CHAIR [inaudible] AS CHAIR [inaudible] QUESTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- APOLOGIES FOR BEING LATE AND IS STUCK ON THE SENATE FLOOR SOME SORRY FOR MISSING. MOST ABILITY W. PEAS COMMENTS IS WAS SDG ANY -- FIRST BEFORE I I QUESTION IF YOU FOR SOME OF THEM YUNIS AND I USED TO WORK HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE IN THE ROOM WITH A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE BEFORE I DO THAT WHY I GOT YOU ALL HERE. WANNA GET YOUR TAKE ON SORT OF DE ARE PLANNING WHAT WHAT ARE YOU ALL DOING PROACTIVELY ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES I HEARD A LOT ABOUT PROCUREMENT BUT NOT. MUCH ON THAT FRONT SO JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE HOW YOUR ARM -- EMBRACING THAT OR NOT -- CORNER CASE SO I THINK COMBO ROOFTOP AND SORT OF STORAGE INEFFICIENCY STARTING TO GET ANALYZE AND AS A COST SAVING MEASURE BUT I WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU ALL PRO ACTIVELY WHAT WHAT YOU'RE. VARIOUS UTILITIES OR NOT NOT UTILITY UTILITIES ARE DOING. ALSO FOR LADWP WE HAVE THIS -- DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE POTENTIAL STUDY THAT WE ARE UNDERTAKING AND LOOKING UP TO WAR. IN IN OUR DENSELY POPULATED AREAS -- WHAT IS THE POTENTIAL FOR DE ARE PHAM DEPLOYMENT? WHAT'S THE TIMING ON I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I'M NOT SURE -- HOW FAR THE STUDY IS IN THE PROCESS AND BUT IT WOULD BE INCORPORATED IN OUR JOBS STRATEGIC LONG TERM RESOURCE PLAN? OKAY SO IT'S PART OF THE STRATEGIC LONG TERM RESOURCE PLAN WHICH IS ALSO WHERE YOU'RE LARGER UTILITY SCALE PROCUREMENTS ARE CRUEL AND AS WELL AS LOCAL. RAYCOM YES GOT IT OKAY OTHERS. SURE PAPAGO -- SO OF JUST KIND OF GO DOWN THE LIST OF THE D. E. R.'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- PER OUR LOCAL BUSINESS OUR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS PLAN WERE PARTNERING WITH EXISTING E. PROVIDERS IN THE LOCAL AREA TO PROMOTE AND ENHANCE E.. MANY CCA'S I BEGUN -- TO LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO RUN THEIR OWN E. PROGRAMS I THINK IN OUR EARLY STAGE WE SEE MORE OPPORTUNITY IN HELPING TO EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY AND MAKE USE OF EXISTING E. PROVIDERS. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT OVER TIME -- STORAGE -- AS I MENTIONED WITH THE OAKLAND CLEAN ENERGY INITIATIVE WE'RE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER TO INVEST IN STORAGE -- WITH RESPECT TO DEMAND RESPONSE WE HAVE A PILOT OUT RIGHT NOW AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT THE RESULTS OF THAT PILOT ARE AND WE CONTINUED WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR DEMAND RESPONSE -- PROGRAMS DISTRIBUTED GENERATION WE ARE ACTUALLY OFFERING OUR NON CUSTOMERS WHO ARE -- THE MOST DISADVANTAGE SO EITHER LOW INCOME OR MEDICAL THEY SIGN AN ADDER TO THEIR NAME RATE TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO GO NAM. AND WILL AGAIN -- BE LOOKING FOR OTHER STRATEGIC PLACES IN OUR COMMUNITY TO PUT SOLAR OR EVEN BETTER SOLAR PLUS STORAGE. AND THEN WITH RESPECT TO TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION IT'S AN AREA THAT A LOT OF CCA'S HAPPEN ON ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN DESIGNING PROGRAMS WITH THEIR TRANSPORTATION -- OFFICES FOR THEIR COMMUNITY. AGAIN EARLY STAGE FOR US BUT IT'S OUT. JUST IN GENERAL TERMS FOR US WE HAVE -- FILE PLANTS BE YOU SEE ON ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS STORAGE HECTIC WITH FILED MIDDLE OF LAST MONTH -- WE HAVE NAM PROCEEDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON I THINK WE WERE THE FIRST AYE YOU TO SURPASS THE THE NAM NUMBERS WE DO HAVE CONTINUING. CONCERNS ABOUT COST SHIFT SO SHE WITH NAM THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDRESSED. AND THEN FINALLY ANY OF THE WE'VE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE AND WE'RE LOOKING AT NEW OPPORTUNITIES NOW FOR CHARGING STATIONS. TO FALL IN LINE WITH SOME OF THE DEBATES ARE GOING ON HERE -- FOR UBER AND LEFT WHERE WE CAN PLACE THOSE ON CROSS TOWN FREEWAYS WE'VE LOOKED AT EXIT DATA THROUGH CALTRANS TO SEE WHO'S HOW MANY CARS ARE EXAMPLE VARIOUS EXCEPT WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. AND LOOKING TO DEPLOY AGAIN WE HAVE FOLLOWS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- THOSE ARE NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY FROM SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS BUT WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE GOVERNOR'S GOALS OF GETTING ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. AND WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT THAT ISSUE WITH THE WITH THE COMMISSION WOULD. ASK FOR YOUR HELP TO IN GETTING THOSE THINGS THROUGH VERY GOOD -- IF YOU INDULGE ME ONE OTHER LINE OF QUESTIONING IS ONE TO RAISE SO -- WHILE YOU HAVE. THESE FOLKS UP HERE. DID YOU ALREADY TALK ABOUT GHG EMISSIONS TRACKING IN THE WEST AND WORK AS WELL AS SYSTEM POWER IN SORT OF WHAT THINGS ARE LOOKING LIKE OUR RIGHTS IF YOU GUYS READY TOUCH THAT. IS INCLUDING WRECKED TRACKING IN THE WEST DO WE GET INTO THAT ISSUE A LITTLE BIT -- MAYBE ORDER. MAYBE NOT I'M I'M SAYING SPEND MAYBE A NOT JUST A CURIOUS TO HEAR HOW HOW HOW WERE. WERE DOING THAT TRACKING PROCESS. AT THIS POINT UNCLEAR TO ME WE DON'T HAVE ANY REXALL WORSHIP. FOR PURE RENEWABLE SO WE'VE NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED TO USE IN IRAQ'S OKAY. SO FOR DWP WE HAVE OUR SPECIFIC LONG TERM CONTRACTS OR WE KNOW -- WHAT THE -- RENEWABLE OUTPUT IS WHAT'S BROUGHT INTO THEIR OUR SYSTEM WE ALSO -- ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET WHERE -- THE CHI SO CAN TRACK -- DEVELOP THE PROCESS TO TRACK -- THESE MEGA WHAT'S COMING IN AND OUT -- MOLE WE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SOURCE FROM OUR OUR RESOURCES KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE FARM WHAT OUR INCLUDED IS PREFERRED RESOURCES WITHIN THAT MARKET -- SO -- MODE WE BELIEVE TRACKING THAT GREENHOUSE GASES IS NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM PROBLEM THE ADVENTURES OF THE PORTION OF YOUR RENEWABLES PORTFOLIO THAT'S THAT'S ADDRESS THROUGH. REX. NINE WE ARE NOT USING RACKS CARRIER USING THE ACTUAL ENERGY FROM LONG TERM CONTRACTS GUY. YOU'RE SO WHEN WE'RE DOING CONTRACTS IT IS BOTH FOR THE RENEWABLE ENERGY ITSELF AS WELL AS THE RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS BUNDLED TOGETHER. SO WHEN YOU GO TO YOUR CUSTOMERS AND YOU TELL YOU TALK ABOUT A PREMIUM PRODUCT YOU OFFER AND AND YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A 100% -- GREENER RENEWABLES THAT. WE'RE DEVELOPING A 100% READER DEVELOPING THAT AND AND IN THE CURRENT THE BASE LINE PRODUCE. EIGHTY YEAH IT'S A IT'S 38% RENEWABLE. 85% GREENHOUSE GAS FREE THE DATA SAID GIGI FREE THIRTY LIVES AND SO WHAT WITH THAT 38% RENEWABLE IS THAT WRECK BAY STORES THAT THROUGH ITS ITS A RENEWABLE ENERGY THAT SO WE'RE USING THE ENERGY AS WELL AS THAT YOU GET THE REAL SO ENERGY MONTHS OLD IT'S NOT. UNBUNDLE THE RATS YOU'RE USING TO GET TO THAT THEIR THAT'S RIGHT -- I THINK IS YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL WORRIED ABOUT. SYSTEM POWER UNSPECIFIED POWER -- CHO FINDING ITS WAY IN WHICH WE KNOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE LIST BUT IT'S ALL THROUGHOUT VARIOUS PORTFOLIOS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I THINK ITS D. GENIE ACTUALLY IS SOME. STING DATA ON THAT DID YOU SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE. YEAH I DID A LITTLE BIT THAT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS -- HALF OF THE SEVENTIES WE ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO THE TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN POWER CONTENT LEVEL DO IT THROUGH THE CDC. THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN MEMBERS ARE AVAILABLE YET. HALF OF THE EVENTY THAT REPORTED. RECEIVED MORE THAN 40% OF THEIR POWER FROM UNSPECIFIED RESOURCES -- AND THERE ARE THIRTY THREE OF THE SEVENTY ARE BELOW THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE PS REQUIREMENT NUMBER. WE FIND THOSE TO BE PRETTY AMAZING THERE'S AN EARLIER PANEL TALK ABOUT THE MEETING THE GOALS THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AND MANY OTHERS ARE MEETING THOSE GOALS BUT THIRTY THREE OF THE SEVENTY WERE BELOW AND IN THE LAST REPORT. HIS SONGS HAVE. OKAY IF IF YOU WOULD IF A BIGGER INDULGENCE ONE OTHER LINE AND IT IT IT ACTUALLY ISN'T ABOUT YOU THREE IS JUST IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE LEFT IN THE ROOM. I WANT TO GET A SENSE OF EDISON OR PJ NEAR HERE [inaudible] DIFFERING PERSPECTIVES I KNOW THEY'RE SORT OF DIFFERENT -- MAYBE PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES CERTAINLY DIFFERENT -- PORTFOLIOS THAT YOU'VE GOT IS WAS DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASE IS RIGHT I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO. AND SEEN OBSCENE PJ ANY AT LEAST BE CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM YOU ALL. BUT EDISON'S WELCOME -- TO AND IT ALSO IT SEEM TO SAME QUESTION GOES FOR CMU WAY JUST. A LOT A DIFFERENT MUNICIPAL. KINDS OF POWER BEING DELIVERED. YOUR ABA YOU'VE GOT A VERY LARGE ORNERY COMPLICATED CUSTOMER BASE WHICH I'M PROUD TO BE -- ONE BUT YET JUST. CURIOUS TO JUST BROADEN THIS OUT A LITTLE BIT AND THE SAME WOULD GO MISS BRANFORD FOR THE CCAC AS WELL JUST THINGS THAT MAYBE WEREN'T COVERED HER OUGHT TO BE REYES JUST PUT TRAVIS GOOD INTEGRATED CONGRESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY. AND AYE I REGRET THAT YOU MISSED MISTER CALLUSES COMMENTS THERE WERE VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH -- WHAT WE WOULD I WANT TO COMMENT ON ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES -- THAT ARE OUT THERE -- THING -- BUILDING UPON AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MR CALLACE MADE WOULD BE -- P. GENIES SUPPORT -- FOR THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE PC ADOPTED OF THAT I'M NOT SURE WHAT SPECIFICALLY COVERED MAYBE JUST. AT A HIGH LEVEL CALLED IN IT'S AN HOURLY ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY CALLED CLEAN THAT SHORT. AND BASICALLY YOU ACCOUNT -- FOR THINGS MORE AN HOURLY LEVEL THINK WE KNOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING MORE MID DAY THAT ARE DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING THE EVENING RAMP AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- WE THINK SHOULD BE ADOPTED STATEWIDE. THANK YOU ALL GO BACK TO THE RECORD. TO TO TURN BACK ON MR KASS IS REMARKS. COLLEAGUE FROM THE COACHELLA. I ADAM SMITH'S THE CALIFORNIA'S AND THANKS FOR THE CHANCE TO THAT ON TO KEN'S COMMENTS I I'D PLAY ACTUALLY GREW THE VALLEY THINK THAT CAN LEAD OTHER. A PRETTY GOOD CASE OF THE KIND OF UTILITY POSITION ON THE FUTURE OF PROCUREMENT ELISE FOR INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AYE I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT CLEAN THAT SHORT METHODOLOGY SOMETHING THAT S. E. SUPPORTS AS WELL. AND FRANKLY WORKED ON IT A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK IT DOES PRESENT A MUCH MORE ROBUST VISION FOR OUR REGULATORS AND YOU FOR CUSTOMERS AT SUCH AS THAT ONE MORE TIME. YEAH YEAH SO THE CLEANUP SHORT METHODOLOGY BASICALLY TAKES A LOOK AT KIND OF THE RESOURCE HAPPENS IT'S BECOME A KIND OF TAKES A LOOK AT ALL THE CONTRACTED RESOURCES WHICH YOU HAVE IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. IMAGINE HOURLY DEMAND IS MEGAWATTS -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE CONTRACTS ON ON THE BOOKS FOR YOU KNOW SOME PROPORTION OF THAT X. MEGAWATTS. IN ANY GIVEN OUR AND THEN WE ARE RELYING UPON MARKET POWER SPOT MARKET PURCHASES TO KIND FILL THE GAP THERE SO THE IDEA IS YOU KNOW. YOU NEED LOOK AT ALL THAT NIGHT RENEWABLE RESOURCES WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVE CONTRACTS WITH ANY KIND OF FOR YOU KNOW OTHER ENTITIES KIND OF NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. AND THE YOU DETERMINE HOW MUCH IS SORT OF LEFT OVER AND THOSE LEFT OVER SPOT MARKET PURCHASES ARE USUALLY ASSIGNED EMISSIONS INTENSITY BASED ON KIND OF A WIDE RANGING DATA ANALYSIS TO COME UP WITH KIND OF AN AVERAGE. SO MEAN THAT THE IN OUR VIEW ACTUALLY DOES IT'S OF THE KIND OF CURRENT METHODOLOGIES THEIR THEIR EXISTING EITHER THE SEE YOU SEE YOU ARE THE THE PC OR A A RP. WE THINK THAT THIS IS KIND OF A STEP FORWARD IN GETTING MUCH MORE GRANULAR AND FOCUS ON THE HOUR SO THIS IS THE STEP BEFORE. SHORT WOULD ACTUALLY GENERATE. SORT OF A MORE GRANULAR LOOK AT WHAT. SYSTEM POWER MIGHT THINK YOU'RE BACKING OUT OF WHAT YOU'RE CONTRACTED FOR AND YEAH DIDN'T THAT THIS THEIR SLIGHT THEY'RE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE GF SHE PRICE SATTAR. ENERGY MARKETS IS SORT OF THE THE BAKED IN ASSUMPTION WE ALL MAKE ABOUT THE COST OF GHGS BASED ON THE CAP AND TRADE ALLOWANCE PRICE YOU KNOW WHAT THE CURRENT MARKET DYNAMICS SUCK. THIS GST PRICE OTHER -- THAT KIND OF OBVIOUSLY INFORMS IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF REMAINING SHARE THAT WE GO TO THE MARKET AND AND PURCHASE A IF THAT MAKES SENSE THROUGH THE CLEAN TRAUMA THE DODGY. RUN TO ALL THE CONTRACTS THERE'S KIND OF THIS LEFTOVER GAP OF THE SPOT MARKET PURCHASES WITHIN THAT GAP THERE IS THIS GHG PRICE OUT OR THAT. YOU KNOW ARE THE KIND OF ASSUMED CARBON MARKETPRICE THAT'S BUILT IN. AND AND THAT KIND OF HOPES DICTATE WHICH RESOURCES IN THAT REMAINING STACKER ECONOMIC OR NOT. WELL. PATRICK WELL TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE REPRESENT OVER -- FORTY PUBLICLY AND ELECTRIC UTILITIES ROUND STATE P.. THINK MISTER SMITH JUST A REALLY GOOD JOB -- DESCRIBING CLEAN NOT SURE BUT I THINK YOUR ORIGINAL QUESTION WAS ABOUT PROCUREMENT IF I'M CORRECT. AND SO -- PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITIES VARY IN SIZE AROUND THE STATE'S A ONE THING THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR MEMBERS AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THEM IS FLEXIBILITY -- LADWP HAS OVER A MILLION CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS -- SOME OF OUR MAYOR AGENCIES HAVE ONLY A FEW THOUSAND AND G. GEOGRAPHY ALSO MAKES A REALLY BIG DIFFERENCE SO WHAT MAY WORK IN LA MAY NOT WORK IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- ALSO LOAD SIZES A OBVIOUSLY WILK A IN SOME WAYS DICTATE WHAT DOES PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES ARE FOR SMALLER PEER USE THEY MAY RELY ON ONE OR TWO CUSTOMERS. AND I SAID THEY WILL PROCURE AN AND BASE OUR PORTFOLIO AROUND THAT WERE AS FOR OF APPEAL YOU LIKE -- LATV DOESN'T HAVE MUCH SIGNIFICANT A BIGGER LOAD THE HABITAT FOR PROCUREMENT STRATEGY AYE SO -- THERE ARE DIFFERING PERSPECTIVES AROUND STATE AMONG THE PEW COMMUNITY ABOUT -- PROCUREMENT BUT THAT'S BASED ON THERE LOW PROFILE. AND SO FLEXIBILITY IS REALLY KEY AT LEAST FOR OUR MEMBERSHIP WHEN IMPLEMENTING RULES -- AND AND REQUIREMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO PROCUREMENT. HOW DO WE DEAL WITH A WITH THIS PERSISTING NATURE AND COAL? I MEAN I I KNOW DWP HAD A LOT OF MAY ORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE PAST WHERE THE MADE COMMITMENTS AND THEY'VE SORT OF SET THEIR SIGHTS ON ANY OF THE BALANCE SHEET WHERE THEY CAN GO AND WORK ON THAT BUT HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT WITH. SOME OF THE OTHER MUNICIPAL UTILITIES OUT THERE THAT SEEM TO JUST. STICKS WITH THEM AND I GET THE FLEXIBILITY POINT BUT I'M IT IT'S MY NURSING THAT CALL CONTRACTS ARE BEING PHASED OUT -- THE THE LATEST I'VE HEARD IT OF THE LATEST CONTRACT BEING PHASED OUT -- MISSED IS -- TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN IT TAKES TIME TO GET OUT OF THOSE TYPES OF CONTRACTS -- AND SO THAT'S JUST THE NATURE OF THAT BUT UP BUT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE ARE BEING PHASED OUT. SO IN THEORY THAT CONTRACT CHIU PATHWAY SHOULD ACTUALLY THERE SHOULD BE A SAY -- OVERALL CHANGE IN THE EMISSIONS PROFILE OF OF THE INDUSTRY BY THAT I MEAN IS THERE THANK YOU IS THAT BEING. LIVING COORDINATE I GUESS FOR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR STATEWIDE MISSION LIKE ARE THEY THERE ANY BAKING THAT. DIVESTMENT YOUR I DON'T KNOW IF MAYBE NOT A DIVESTMENT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT WORD BUT YEAH I I CAN'T ANSWER FOR THE A A RP BUT THERE ARE AND UNDER THE HIGHER P. PROCESS THERE ARE GHG PLANNING TARGETS FOR UTILITIES SO. AND THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE TO ACCOUNT FOR IT -- FOR DOES GHG EMISSION TARGETS. IF I CAN MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT TO THAT PLEASE -- AS FAR AS THE POWER CONTENT LABEL GOES IN THE UNSPECIFIED SOURCE FROM THE HIGHER PERCENTAGE. ALL THAT MAY NOT ALWAYS. THANK YOU FOR IT THERE ARE SOME MUNICIPAL UTILITIES THAT STILL HAVE. A COAL CONTRACT SEVEN MORE YEARS OF OUT -- WE PLAN TO BE OUT OF OUT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT IF YOU CAN REDUCE YOUR CALL USAGE -- ESPECIALLY DURING THE CHI SO WHEN YOU CAN USE THAT ON SPECIFIED POWER THE SPARK MARKET POWER THAT. THE ARMY WOULD OVERALL REDUCE THE GREENHOUSE GAS -- FOOTPRINT BY REDUCING COAL USAGE BUT USING UNSPECIFIED -- THEORETICALLY IS CLOSE SOMETHING LESS THAN WHAT UP CLOSE STRICTLY COAL. RESEARCH IN OTHER WORDS IF WE GAVE CHI SO MORE ROOM TO RUN AND ACTUALLY I MEAN ALREADY THAT MARKETS LOOKING CLEANER THAN JUST THE GENERIC. AS WE I WAS GONNA LA POWER BUT THEN IN THEORY. IF THEY WERE GIVEN MORE FLEXIBILITY TO GO OUT AND BUY OR INSERTED INTEGRATE INTO THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY EVEN CLEANER RESOURCE WE MIGHT SEE. THAT DIDN'T REALLY SEE ANY OF THAT ON SPECIFIED I SEE ACROSS. I WAS I HAD FOR THESE FOLKS CENTER. REMEMBER ANY QUESTIONS. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE SOME BY GENERAL COMMENTS -- MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S WEST OF THAT IS RIGHT ON THE HAVES HERE CLICK CALIFORNIA -- THANK YOU FOR ARRANGING THIS THIS HEARING IS ONE ZERO QUICKLY THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- IN MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS THAT WERE. WORKING TO MOVE AWAY FROM WHAT TRANSITION AWAY FROM DIRTY SOURCES THAT INCLUDE BIOMASS AND REGENERATION THAT WE FOCUS ON A YEAH OTHER NAVAL OPTIONS AND AND RESOURCES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME BUT BONHAM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICE ASSOCIATION -- I JUST LIKE TO ENDORSE THE COMMENTS OF MS BRAND FROM EAST BAY COMMUNITY. CHOICE ENERGY -- KELSEY CA -- IS THE TRADE ASSOCIATION ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF OPERATIONAL CCA'S. AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES FOR TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION. AND ONE OF OUR OBJECTIVES IS TO FOSTER BEST PRACTICES. SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE'RE WORKING TO COORDINATE ALL THE WITH ALL THE OPERATIONAL CCA'S TO ADOPT COMMON METHODOLOGY TO STANDARDIZE. OUR GHG ACCOUNTING BETWEEN CCA'S THAT CAN COLLECTIVELY MEASURE AND REPORT. ON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS A STATE GOALS. THERE IS A FOCUS HERE TODAY BOTH ON THE ENERGY SUPPLY AND THEN ALSO MELISSA ON THE SPRINT SPOKE ALSO ABOUT THE PROGRAMS. AND I THINK THAT DOTS ARE ALMOST MORE DIFFICULT CHICHI ACCOUNTING IS TO DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS FOR MAKING ON THOSE PROGRAMS -- IN THE COMMUNITIES AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WERE RAISED TODAY. IN ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER BATTERY STORAGE -- IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE HAVE ON THE GRID AND ALSO. IT -- MISTER OF FRIEDMAN'S COMMENTS -- SERVER CRITICISM THAT CCA'S DON'T MAKE BIG NEW DEVELOPMENTAL COMMITMENTS AND MS BRAND ALLUDED TO SOME OF THAT IN TERMS OF THE CCA'S WE COLLECT STOP FORMAT. AT KELSEY CA ARM AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I I THOUGHT I MIGHT BRING TO ATTENTION ONE OF THE ODD IT ONE OF THOSE IS. JOINT PROCUREMENT THAT'S BEING DONE BY THE CCAS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE MONTEREY BAY COMMUNITY POWER AND SILICON VALLEY CLEAN ENERGY WENT OUT FOR JOINT SOLICITATION -- THEY WERE GOING TO THEIR ENTRY INTO THREE RENEWABLE CONTRACTS ONE IS FOR TWO HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF WIND GENERATION FOR FIFTEEN YEAR TERMS AGAIN THAT QUESTION ABOUT LONG TERM -- AND THIS IS ALL IN STATE DEVELOPMENT THAT WILL BE COMPLETED -- AT TO OTHERS ONE FOR FIFTEEN YEAR TERM ONE FOR TWENTY YEAR TERM BOTH HUNDRED FIFTY MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR. PLUS FORTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF STEP OF STORAGE. THESE PROJECTS WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF THE THREE CONTRACTS IS ONE BILLION. SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE POINT THAT YES -- PROCUREMENT IS BEING DONE FOR RENEWABLES AND ON A LARGER SCALE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HELLO EVER BLIX FOR THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING LARGE SCALE UTILITY -- UTILITY SIZED I'M INDEPENDENT POWER PRODUCERS INCLUDING WIND GEOTHERMAL. BIOMASS AND SOLAR AND IP HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING AT THE P. YOU SEE OVER VARIOUS PROCEEDINGS TRYING TO PUSH ADDITIONAL RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT. AND WE ARE SOMEWHAT CONCERNED THAT AT THE P. YOU SEE THAT HASN'T BEEN -- RENEWABLE PROCUREMENT OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS ON FOR SOME OF THE LARGE SCALE RESOURCES THAT WE REPRESENT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT YOU NEED CONTINUED AND SUSTAIN RENEWABLE DEVELOPMENT AND I'M PROCUREMENT TO REACH THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS -- INCLUDING USING THE STATE'S INDIGENOUS RESOURCES LIKE GOTHERMAL THAT MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE IN YOUR DISTRICTS THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE VERY. FINING THE STATE AT THIS PERIOD OF TIME AND WE WOULD JUST ASK THAT WE MOVE EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IN TERMS OF I AM. WORKING TO SOLVE SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES SO WE CAN KICK START THAT CONTINUED AND SUSTAIN RENEWABLE DEVELOPMENT THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE. THINK IT LOOKS YOU MIGHT JUST TO GET HERE SO. IF WE IF WE DON'T ACCELERATE PROCUREMENT. HAVE YOU GUYS STARTED DOING THE MATH ON COSTS. TO THE STATE OR AYE IT IS IT IS A COST SAVINGS POTENTIALLY TO BE PROCURING EVEN THOUGH IT'S ACTUALLY SPENDING MORE MONEY OR I STARTED LOOKING AT THAT AGE I THINK HOW I WOULD THEM DESCRIBE IT IS THAT WE REPRESENT A LARGE SKILLED GENERATORS IN THE STATE AND WE THINK. THAT WE CAN DO IT THE MOST AFFORDABLY COST EFFECTIVELY AND RELIABLY SO I THINK THAT'S HOW I WOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION OKAY. MAYBE YOU COULD ACTUALLY MS MILLS MAYBE THAT COMMENT ON THAT TOO ID GERMANE TO YOUR GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DANIEL MALES I'M BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN WIND ENERGY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CAUCUS -- SENATOR START YOUR POINT I THINK THAT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IDENTIFIED A SAVINGS OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR AND LEVEL AS STE TWENTY SIXTEEN DOLLARS. FOR DOING NEAR TERM PROCUREMENT OF TAX ADVANTAGED RENEWABLES WHICH INCLUDES WINS WIND AND SOLAR -- BOTH WIND AND SOLAR AVAILABLE AT ABOUT A 30% DISCOUNT RIGHT NOW COMPARED TO POST PTC COSTS -- AND THOSE PROJECTS WOULD HAVE TO COMMENCE CONSTRUCTION AND TWENTY NINETEEN SO. UP THERE IS A SAVINGS ASSOCIATE WOULD DO WITH DOING THIS PROCUREMENT NOW IT HAS BEEN STUDIED -- BY THE STATE AND I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE COULD ALSO DIFFER SOME OF THE DELIVERY ON THESE CONTRACTS INTO LEADER IN THE TWENTY TWENTIES. AND BY DOING THAT THEY COULD ALSO DEFER PAYMENTS ON THOSE PROJECTS INTO THE LATE TWENTY INTO THEM AND TWENTY TWENTIES. SO YOU COULD STRUCTURE PROCUREMENT TO ALIGN WITH THE STATE'S NEED FOR RENEWABLES -- AND LOCK IN A SAVINGS OF THE TAX CREDITS EARLY. AND JUST ONE OTHER KIND OF MORE BROAD NOTE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE STILL HAVE AND I THINK IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT THE UTILITIES ARE WELL ON THEIR WAY. TO MEETING THE 50% ARE YES -- WE NEED ABOUT TEN GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLES WE'RE FACING. MORE EXTREME A NEED. TO AND BUILDING SECTORS AND ALL OF THIS CAN BE DONE COST EFFECTIVELY WITH HOLES IN RENEWABLES THINK IF. THANK YOU IN YOUR HOUSE. OKAY SEEN IT AND NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US WE SET OUT TO BE VERY BASIC QUESTIONS -- TO AND I PREFACE THIS CONVERSATION IT WAS ABOUT TRACKING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM OUR PROCUREMENT PROCESS [inaudible] AT CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ALONG THE WAY. AS WELL AS THEM TIMELINES. SOMETIMES HEARINGS BRING ABOUT MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN ANSWERS. BUT NEVERTHELESS HAVE IS CONVERSATION I WAS EXTREMELY PART FOR US AND VERY TIMELY OF FOR MEMBERS. OF VARIOUS AGENCIES AS WELL AS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO WATCH AYE MITCHELL THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. AND BUILDINGS [inaudible] VOTE [inaudible] RATHER [inaudible] YEAH
