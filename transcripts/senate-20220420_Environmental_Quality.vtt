PARTICULARLY. THOSE THAT ARE THE

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:41.700
MOST COMMUNITY BASED THAT ARE

OAK WOODLANDS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:19:39.611 --> 00:19:42.548
CLEARED THEY'RE GONE- AND WE

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:44.783

BY DISEASE- INVASIVES AND THIS

00:20:16.848 --> 00:20:17.983
IS REALLY PROVIDING A CRUCIAL

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:18.717
STEP IN STANDARDIZING

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.586
PROTECTIONS WE'VE SEEN A SORT OF

00:20:20.652 --> 00:20:24.323
PATCHWORK OF PERMITTING AND- AND

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:25.424
A LACK OF RECOGNITION FOR THE

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.659
BROADER ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS OF

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:30.329
OAK WOODLANDS- WE KNOW THAT IN

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.831
CERTAIN CASES THIS ONE TO ONE

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:34.900
OAK TREE MITIGATION POLICY JUST

00:20:34.967 --> 00:20:36.969
DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE IF YOU'RE-

00:20:37.035 --> 00:20:39.504
YOU'RE CUTTING DOWN I'M- THAT

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:40.539
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IN THE MIDDLE

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:42.374
OF A HABITAT AREA AND RE

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.275
PLANTING A SAPLING TWENTY MILES

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.911
AWAY- IT REALLY DOESN'T DO

00:20:45.978 --> 00:20:47.312
ANYTHING FOR THE BROADER.

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.880
BENEFITS IN THE MITIGATION

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:50.749
PATTERNS THAT WE'RE HOPING TO

00:20:50.816 --> 00:20:52.551
ACHIEVE- THROUGH THAT ECOSYSTEM

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:53.952
SERVICE THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:55.887
AN OAK WOODLAND AND SO RIGHT NOW

00:20:55.954 --> 00:20:58.957
THE BILL HAS A THREE. THE

00:20:59.024 --> 00:21:00.692
SPECIFIES THE ON THE REMOVAL OF

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.427
A CERTAIN THRESHOLD THE TREES TO

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:03.829
TRIGGER THAT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT

00:21:03.895 --> 00:21:06.798
ON THE ENVIRONMENT. BUT BUT I

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.400
DID SHARE IN MY OPENING REMARKS

00:21:08.467 --> 00:21:09.735
THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN

00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:10.869
CONSTRAINING THAT ONLY WITHIN

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.372
AREAS THAT HAVE THAT SORT OF

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:16.775
HABITAT. CONNECTIVITY VALUE- SO

00:21:16.842 --> 00:21:18.977
THE ILL THOUGH DOES NOT STOP

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.445
DEVELOPMENT COUNTRY TO SOME OF

00:21:20.512 --> 00:21:22.914
THE- THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS

00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:24.483
IT WOULD NOT HOLD DEVELOPMENT

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:26.985
EVEN IF YOU DID HAVE- OAK

00:21:27.052 --> 00:21:29.087
WOODLANDS ON YOUR PROPERTY. I'M

00:21:29.154 --> 00:21:30.555
THERE ARE VARIOUS MITIGATION

MEASURES THAT ARE OFFERED FOR

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.126
THAT CONSERVATION- CONSERVATION

00:21:34.192 --> 00:21:36.995
EASEMENTS. I'M AN APPROPRIATE

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:40.565
PLANTING. A NUMBER- AND

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.634
REPLACEMENT PROGRAM AS OPPOSED

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.203
TO JUST A ONE FOR ONE- AND OTHER

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:47.172
MEDICATIONS CAN BE DEVELOPED BY

00:21:47.239 --> 00:21:49.574
LEAD AGENCIES BUT ONE TO ONE

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:50.842
TREE REPLACEMENT ALONE WE THAT

00:21:50.909 --> 00:21:52.978
WE THINK CAN ONLY FULFIL- ABOUT

00:21:53.045 --> 00:21:54.446
HALF THE TOTAL MITIGATION

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.214
EFFORTS JUST GIVEN THE TIME SPAN

00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:57.749
OF THESE TREES AND THE VALUE

00:21:57.816 --> 00:22:00.352
THEY PROVIDE AND THAT THE AGENT

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:03.121
TAKES TO ACTUALLY GET A SAPLING

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:04.990
TO A FULL OF WHEAT WE KNOW THE

00:22:05.057 --> 00:22:07.025
THIS IS THE STORY OF. AN ACORN

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:09.161
FALLING- AND BECOMING A MIGHTY

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.697
OAK BUT IT SEEK WAS TIMELINE

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.098
ISN'T THE SAME AS NATURE'S AND

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:15.300
SO- WE THINK IS THIS MEASURES

00:22:15.367 --> 00:22:16.835
CRITICAL TO PROTECTING WHAT

00:22:16.902 --> 00:22:18.503
REMAINING HABITAT WE HAVE LEFT

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:19.705
ESPECIALLY IN THE WILDLAND URBAN

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.540

00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.872
OF A REAL KERNEL OF VALUE HERE-

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:46.544

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:29.714
LOCALLY DRIVEN- SENSITIVITIES SO

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:30.748

STATEWIDE MAPS THAT HIGHLIGHT

00:32:45.396 --> 00:32:46.631
THESE AREAS OF CONCERN SO WE ARE

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.499
INSTANCE IN OUR AREA WE'VE GOT A

00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:49.400

AND SO IF YOU TAKE THREE OAK

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.412
WOODLAND OAK YOU KNOW TREES OUT

00:33:01.479 --> 00:33:02.413
OF THAT SORT OF INTERCONNECTED

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.948
WOODLAND YOU ARE GOING TO DO

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.283
DAMAGE. HOWEVER IF YOU'RE

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:07.118
TALKING ABOUT IN AN ISOLATED

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:08.586

FOR THAT KIND OF DEVELOPMENT

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.235
THAT KIND OF PROPERTY SO. I

00:33:24.302 --> 00:33:26.070

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:34.784
BATTERIES ARE ACCESSIBLE BUT

00:57:34.851 --> 00:57:36.419
THEN YOU KNOW THE SYSTEM IS FROM

00:57:36.486 --> 00:57:39.055
AND- MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:41.357
WAY IN A PLACE TO DISPOSE OF

00:57:41.424 --> 00:57:41.991
THEM- YOU KNOW GLAD TO TAKE ANY

00:57:42.058 --> 00:57:43.860
OTHER QUESTIONS BUT I THINK THE

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:46.229
EMPHASIS HERE IS- THIS IS BEEN A

00:57:46.296 --> 00:57:47.597
VERY. COLLABORATIVE PROCESS

00:57:47.664 --> 00:57:49.532
THROUGHOUT- WE'VE LEARNED FROM

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.668
LAST YEAR I THINK IS ONE OF THE

00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:53.903
WINDOWS VENTION I THOUGHT WE

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.038
MADE A DISTINCTION THIS YEAR

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.206
BETWEEN LOOSE AND A BETTER

00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:57.907
BATTERIES AND WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW

00:57:57.974 --> 00:58:00.210
CARILLO SIR PROCESSES FOR BOTH

00:58:00.276 --> 00:58:01.778
BOTH ARE SUBJECT TO AMENDMENT

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.546
YOU KNOW IN WAYS THAT INCREASE

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.215
THE EFFICIENCY WITH THE END GOAL

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:09.185
OF GETTING SOMETHING THAT WORKS.

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:12.689
YEP OKAY. ALL RIGHT I'M- OKAY I

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:13.823
GET THE OTHER CONCERN THAT WAS

00:58:13.890 --> 00:58:16.092
RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IS A

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:17.727
GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE THE

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:18.928
EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:22.866
RIGHT NOW- AND HELD THAT. YOU

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:25.001
KNOW HOW HOW DO YOU ENVISION

00:58:25.068 --> 00:58:26.703
BECAUSE ALL EVERY EPA PROGRAM

00:58:26.769 --> 00:58:28.071
SEARCH WHAT'S ON THE GROUND WHAT

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:30.373
WE DO IN RIGHT NOW AND THEN

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.509
EVOLVES INTO- ANOTHER COLLECTION

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.678
AND DISPOSAL PROCESS BUT YOU

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:38.214
STILL. YES HIGHLIGHT THE BEST

00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:40.283
PRACTICES IF THERE ARE SOME BEST

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:40.917
PRACTICE AND WE COLLECT

00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.652
BATTERIES HERE RIGHT ON THE-

00:58:42.719 --> 00:58:44.754
YEAH YOU KNOW THEY'RE- CERTAINLY

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:45.722
THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES FOR

00:58:45.788 --> 00:58:48.024
BATTERIES ABOVE A CERTAIN SIZE-

00:58:48.091 --> 00:58:49.993
BUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING. ACROSS

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:53.463
THE WASTE STREAM IS CLEARLY YOU

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:56.032
KNOW THE- YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY OF

00:58:56.099 --> 00:58:57.567
BATTERIES COMING INTO THE WASTE

00:58:57.634 --> 00:58:59.202
STREAM IMPROBABLY SUPPOSED THIS

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.837
IS OVERWHELMING BILITY. TO

00:59:00.904 --> 00:59:02.906
HANDLE THEM A. N. O. N. AT REAL

00:59:02.972 --> 00:59:05.909
RISK- TIMMER STRIDES WE INTEND

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.710
TO TRUST THAT TO TRANSPORT TRASH

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:09.145
SO IS THIS IS REAL RIGHT YOU

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:10.313
KNOW THE OF THESE FIRES A

00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.048
REALISTIC YOU HURT SOMEONE WHO

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.316
INSISTS- A FIRE AT A DISPOSAL

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:14.817
FACILITY IS BOTH DANGEROUS BUT

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.119
IT CAN WHAT IT CAN RESULT IN

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:17.987
SHUTTING DOWN THAT FACILITY.

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:19.956
PRECIPITATION AT A TIME YOU CAN

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.891
RESULT IN THAT FACILITY LOSING

00:59:21.958 --> 00:59:22.759
ITS INSURANCE- AND HAS AND HE

00:59:22.825 --> 00:59:24.093
HAS A BIG SORT OF THE COULD

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.029
KENNEDY EFFECT THROUGHOUT THE

00:59:26.095 --> 00:59:27.230
YOU KNOW THE WHOLE SYSTEM. AND

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:30.233
SO IT YOU KNOW DO GLAD TO BUILD

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.802
ON ANYTHING THAT WORKS BUT I

00:59:32.869 --> 00:59:34.070
THINK THE OBSERVATION IS. AS IT

00:59:34.137 --> 00:59:35.538
RELATES TO BATTERIES IS THERE'S

00:59:35.605 --> 00:59:37.407
NEED HERE THE NEEDS DRESS IN THE

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:39.375
ONLY. SERVE LOGICAL APPROACH IS

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:40.610
AN EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:45.181
RESPONSIBILITY MODEL. I MEAN I

00:59:45.248 --> 00:59:47.150
THINK THE U. YOU GIVE. THE

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.484
PRODUCERS THE LEAD RESPONSIBLE

00:59:48.551 --> 00:59:49.652
BUT YOU STILL HAVE. YOU STILL

00:59:49.719 --> 00:59:52.255
GOT IT SOME STUFF IS EVEN MORE

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:53.289
WITH. THE PR THERE STILL COULD

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.857
BE SOME THINGS THAT THE CONSUMER

00:59:54.924 --> 00:59:56.592
THROWS INTO. THE WE STREAM SO

00:59:56.659 --> 00:59:57.860
PART OF THAT IS EDUCATING THE

00:59:57.927 --> 01:00:00.129
CONSUMER. MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE FOR

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.631
THAT IN AND WORKING WITH OUR-

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:03.967
THE MERCENARY BECAUSE OF THE

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.768
REMAINDER THAT COULD SEND. THAT

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.904
NOW IS PART OF THE PRODUCERS

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.072
RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH THAT

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.740
NOT. WASTE MANAGEMENT OR

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.041
REPUBLICAN THERE'S GOT TO BE

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:13.576
SOME COORDINATION WITH THOSE

01:00:13.643 --> 01:00:14.911
GUYS TO WHICH HOPEFULLY IT

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:17.413
SHRINKS BUT THEN. BUT THEN WE

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.548
FIGURE OUT THE BEST PRACTICES ON

01:00:18.614 --> 01:00:21.117
HOW TO. REMOVE THE REMOVE THAT

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.685
STUFF WHEN THERE'S LESS OF IT I

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:24.087
GUESS TO TOTALLY AGREE AND I

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:25.788

THE STATE'S TOTAL CO TWO

BUT ALSO FOR OUR WORKFORCE AND

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.200
OVERALL ECONOMY. THE USE OF C.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.068
C. U. S. COULD ENABLE DIFFICULT

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:27.803
TO DECARBONISE INDUSTRIES TO

01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:49.058
ONE OF THE BIG IS THAT WE'VE

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.159
BEEN TALKING ABOUT IS THIS

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.961
TRANSITION. AWAY FROM FOSSIL

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:54.630
FUELS TO- A GREENER ECONOMY AND

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:55.898
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.400
TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WORK%

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:59.802

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.604

HOW'S THAT WORK FORCE. ALSO

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.177
CONSIDER THAT MANY ORGANIZATION

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:38.526
AT LEAST THE GUIDELINES THAT

01:21:38.593 --> 01:21:40.328
WILL BE SPELLED OUT HERE SO THE

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:45.634
IMPORTANCE OF- GETTING IT RIGHT.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:50.071
IS KEY. YOU'VE CHOSEN TO HOUSE

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:51.940
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE C. C.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:54.476
U. S. PROGRAM WITH THE AIRPORT

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.845
AND I SEE THE INITIAL

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.913
DESIRABILITY BECAUSE MOST OF THE

01:21:58.980 --> 01:22:00.415
FOLKS THAT HAVE TESTIFIED OR

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.650
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LOW CARBON

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:03.518
FUEL STANDARD SO. THAT'S WHERE

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.587
THAT THAT PROGRAMS THAT HOUSE

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.455
AND THEY ARE GOING THROUGH THEIR

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:10.258
SCOPING PLAN AND- I AM FOREVER.

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:11.593
HOPEFUL THAT SOMETHING GOOD

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.295
COMES OUT THE SCOPING PLAN THIS

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:15.397
TIME BUT WE KNOW THAT THE ENERGY

01:22:15.463 --> 01:22:17.198
COMMISSION ACTUALLY DOES THE

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:18.833
CITING OF THESE FACILITIES WE

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.602
KNOW THE- STATE WATER RESOURCES

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:24.372
BOARD IS DEALING WITH. WATER-

01:22:24.439 --> 01:22:26.508
CONCERNS WE HAVE OTHER STATE

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:29.177
AGENCIES THAT HAVE JURISDICTION

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:33.214
OVER THESE THESE PLANTS- PENCE.

01:22:33.281 --> 01:22:35.216
AND SOME OPERATIONS ACTUALLY

01:22:35.283 --> 01:22:36.217
DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE LOW

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:38.720
CARBON FUEL STANDARD BECAUSE OF

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:41.556
BECAUSE THE USE. WHAT DO YOU YOU

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:44.659
SAY ABOUT. COORD OKAY WITH THAT

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:47.295
SAID. DO YOU THINK THAT THERE'S

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:49.364
A DOES OUR ABILITY OR AN

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:50.799
IMPROVEMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE

01:22:50.865 --> 01:22:53.268
THE IN COORDINATION WITH THESE

01:22:53.335 --> 01:22:55.403
OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT HAVE.

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:58.907
RESTRICTION OVER OVER IT- YEAH

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:02.177
OVER CITING BECAUSE PART OF THIS

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:05.347
IS JUST CITING AND- AND-

01:23:05.413 --> 01:23:08.183
RESERVOIR- LOCATIONS AND THAT

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:10.352
CALCIUM IS ANOTHER STATE AGENCY

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:12.987
THAT THAT PLACE IN THIS ARENA.

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:15.056
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THE

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:17.225
OTHER AGENCY THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:19.227
PART OF THE DISCUSSION IS THE

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:21.329
STATE FARM FIRE MARSHAL BECAUSE

01:23:21.396 --> 01:23:23.465
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR PIPES-

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:27.168
AND- THE SAFETY OF A- OF

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:31.239
CONDUCTING A- THE PRODUCT

01:23:31.306 --> 01:23:35.009
THROUGH PIPES- IT'S A SUBJECT OF

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.911
A OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION THAT

01:23:36.978 --> 01:23:38.513
THE WHOLE IDEA OF PUTTING IT

01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.482
THROUGH TO THE IN THE AIRBOAR

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.150
IS BECAUSE THEY ARE THEY'RE

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.518
DOING THEY'RE SCOPING ANALYSIS

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.787
AND YOU HAVEN'T LCMS. BUT ALSO

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.556
ONE OF THE UP- REQUIREMENTS IS

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.960
THAT- IT LEAST AS WE AS I

01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:56.131
ENVISION IT IS THAT WE ACTUALLY

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:58.700
THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO DO CCS

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:03.271
THAT WE ALSO ENSURE THAT THE-

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:07.876
PARTICULATE. OF BY PRODUCTS- ARE

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.011
CAPTURED AND ARE REDUCED AS WELL

01:24:10.078 --> 01:24:11.579
IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT GIVING

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:13.014
UP ONE FOR THE OTHER AND THAT'S

01:24:13.081 --> 01:24:15.049
REALLY IN THE JURISDICTION OF

01:24:15.116 --> 01:24:16.251
THE AIRPORT AND SO IT'S THE

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.285
REASON THAT WAS THE REASONING

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:18.987
BEHIND PUTTING IT IN THE AIRPORT

01:24:19.053 --> 01:24:22.023
BUT BUT ULTIMATELY- I BELIEVE

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:25.860
IT- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO. A-

01:24:25.927 --> 01:24:27.529
HAVE A PROCESS WHERE ALL THE

01:24:27.595 --> 01:24:29.798
PERMITTING HAPPENS IN IN

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:32.567
TOGETHER- SIMULTANEOUSLY AND

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.469
THAT THE AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER.

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.638
YEAH I MEAN IF THE CHURCH IS ONE

01:24:36.704 --> 01:24:38.573
OF THE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.041
WE HAVE HEARD THAT THE DESIRE

01:24:40.108 --> 01:24:41.609
STATED GOALS IS TO DEVELOPING

01:24:41.676 --> 01:24:43.178
THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES OR AN ID

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.546
I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:46.080
AIRPORT BEING THE LEAD. ON THE

01:24:46.147 --> 01:24:47.916
DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES YOU KNOW

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.784
I MEAN I MIGHT BUILT USES THE

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.519
ENERGY COMMISSION TODAY TO DO IT

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.121
WITH THE CAN CONSULTATION FOR

01:24:53.188 --> 01:24:54.923
EXACTLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.524
PARTICULATES ARE REMOVED BUT

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:59.627
THEY-

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.728
LATER BUT THEY SAY OKAY. AFTER

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:02.297
THE PROJECT IS THERE. TELL THE

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.198
AIRPORT HOW IT REDUCES THE

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.466
PARTICULATE MATTER SINCE IT

01:25:04.532 --> 01:25:06.201
DOESN'T IN THE AIRPORTS AS OKAY

01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:11.439
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT- IT'S A- HEY

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.941
IT'S A GOOD FRAMEWORK I MEAN I'M

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:14.809
GOING TO ALL ARE MOVED TO BILL

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:18.012
HERE- IS I KNOW THAT THERE'S

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:20.381
WORK THAT HAS AT HAS TO BE DONE.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.116
ON IT BUT I THINK THAT

01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:24.819
PREDICTABILITY AND ALSO THE

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:27.622
MESSAGE THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING

01:25:27.689 --> 01:25:29.991
TO HAVE SOME FORM OF C. C. U. S.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.092
RIGHT IN IN OUR PORTFOLIO

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:33.428
WHATEVER WHATEVER THAT HOWEVER

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:35.630
THAT GETS DEVELOPED IN I KNOW

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.065
THAT THE NEXT COMMITTEE HAS A

01:25:37.131 --> 01:25:39.033
VERY BIG JOB ON THE BORDER

01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:42.003
OWNERSHIP AND HELP THAT- IS

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:44.372
PLACE AND AGAIN THE PIPELINES IS

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:47.108
A WHOLE OTHER. THE DEAL THAT

01:25:47.175 --> 01:25:48.276
WE'RE JUST NOT. IT'S YOU FOCUSED

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:50.111
ON IT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON IT BUT I

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.880
THINK THAT THAT'S NEEDS. SOME

01:25:51.946 --> 01:25:54.082
WORK SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS.

01:25:54.148 --> 01:26:00.555
YEAH I MISTER. FROM. THANKS

SENATOR JUSTIN IN TERMS OF THE

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.263
NATURE OF THE WHOLE DISCUSSION

AND YOU PUT YOUR SHOULDER TO THE

01:26:10.198 --> 01:26:11.165
WHEEL AND PUT IN SOME REALLY

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:13.268
SUBSTANTIVE FORD SO I APPRECIATE

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:15.203
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO I

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.171
WANT TO DO THE TO DIG INTO THE

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:19.774
PORE SPACE- DISCUSSION TOO MUCH

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.242
RIGHT NOW JUST GETTING INTO THE

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:22.844
NITTY GRITTY BECAUSE I'M HOPEFUL

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.312
WE CAN O THAT THROUGH. NATURAL

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:27.315
RESOURCES AND- JUST. HOW HOW TO

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:30.785
ACTUALLY MAKE IT WORK RIGHT IN A

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:32.654
MINERAL ESTATE AND THE LAND IS

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:34.789
STATE AND CONTRACTS PRIOR TO

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:39.427
THAT AND- SO. I WANT TO SET THAT

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.329
ONE ASIDE FOR THE- FUTURE THE-

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:43.264
THE QUESTIONS OR OR CONCERNS I

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:45.600
HAVE I THINK WE'RE- REALLY WILL

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:46.701
EXPLAIN THE HUMAN ANALYSIS I

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:51.306
MEAN I. IT ON PAGE- WHAT IS IT

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:58.012
ON PAGE FIVE VISITS- THE. YES

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.614
EIGHT FIVE I DIDN'T HEAR AYE AYE

01:26:59.681 --> 01:27:01.549
MAYBE IT WAS A LISTENING CLOSELY

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:03.918
BUT- THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.788
ABOUT NOT JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:27:06.854 --> 01:27:10.258
JUSTICE GOALS BUT AROUND- EOR

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.759
AND FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION I ASK

01:27:11.826 --> 01:27:13.227
THE SAME QUESTION AS SENATOR

01:27:13.294 --> 01:27:14.696
SKINNER WHEN HER BILL CAME

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.564
BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. SO THE

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:18.499
CONCERN I'VE HAD I HAVEN'T YOU

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.902
CAN. YOU DON'T YOU CAN DECIDE

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.504
HOW YOU WANT TO ADDRESS IT IT'S

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:24.305
MORE OF A COMMENT THAT A

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:26.641
QUESTION BUT- ESPECIALLYYOUR

01:27:26.708 --> 01:27:28.476
CONTACTS WE GET A LOT OF CARBON

01:27:28.543 --> 01:27:30.511
LOS. WHEN THE WHEN THE FIELDS

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:32.280
ARE OPEN RIGHT THAT CAN HAPPEN.

01:27:32.347 --> 01:27:34.048
HOW DO WE CHAU CERTAINTY THAT

01:27:34.115 --> 01:27:34.849
THAT CARBON'S ACTUALLY STAYING

01:27:34.916 --> 01:27:37.051
THERE PERMANENTLY- SO LOOKING

01:27:37.118 --> 01:27:38.519
FOR PERMANENCE AND LOOKING FOR

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.388
SOME KIND OF BACKSTOP ON THAT

01:27:40.455 --> 01:27:43.224
PERMITS TO MAKE SURE THAT-

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:45.994
FOLKS. STATEWIDE NOT NINE DOES

01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:48.296
NOT A LOCAL POLLUTION ISSUE BUT

01:27:48.363 --> 01:27:49.797
STATEWIDE ARE ASSURED THAT A TON

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.734
IS REALLY A TON IN THE GROUND

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.268
THERE. AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THE

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.470
FEDERAL LEVEL THEY'VE LOOKED AT

01:27:55.536 --> 01:27:57.505
SOME SUGGESTIONS AROUND BACKSTOP

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:58.906
OR SOME KIND OF PULLING YOUR

01:27:58.973 --> 01:28:00.274
BUFFER ACCOUNT SO THAT IF

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:02.210
THERE'S A RELEASE. YOU'LL HAVE

01:28:02.276 --> 01:28:04.212
SOME KIND OF RECOURSE FROM THE

01:28:04.278 --> 01:28:05.713
OPERATOR SO THAT YOU'RE NOT SORT

01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:07.382
OF STUCK IN THE SAME WITH

01:28:07.448 --> 01:28:08.349
FORESTRY. PROJECTS WE'VE HAD

01:28:08.416 --> 01:28:10.184
TROUBLE WITH WHERE YOU KNOW YOU

01:28:10.251 --> 01:28:12.053
YOU BY A FEW MILLION DOLLARS FOR

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.121
THE OFFICE AND IT BURNS UP AND

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:14.956
THEN. WE'RE LEVEL IN THE BACK SO

01:28:15.023 --> 01:28:16.958
HOW TO SORT OF. BUILD THAT

01:28:17.025 --> 01:28:18.860
CARBON RECOURSE IF YOU WILL.

01:28:18.926 --> 01:28:21.095
INTO IT. SO THAT'S PERMITS ON

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:23.097
THE MORE STATEWIDE LEVEL I THINK

01:28:23.164 --> 01:28:25.166
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE CONCERNS

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:27.368
I HAVE A REALLY ABOUT. THE

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.138
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GOING TO

01:28:30.204 --> 01:28:32.774
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THESE WORK

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:33.441
THROUGH THESE PROJECTS. THE

01:28:33.508 --> 01:28:36.177
GOALS IN THE BILL DON'T DON'T

01:28:36.244 --> 01:28:39.881
REALLY DELVE INTO- QUALITY AN

01:28:39.947 --> 01:28:42.483
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE- AND

01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:44.919
I KNOW THAT THIS THE ANALYSIS.

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:47.021
FLOATED ALREADY BUT IN SOME

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:48.122
CASES YOU KNOW THESE ARE VERY

01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:49.290
ENERGY INTENSIVE PROJECTS

01:28:49.357 --> 01:28:51.626
CERTAINLY ON THE CAPTURE SIDE-

01:28:51.693 --> 01:28:52.760
AND IT CAN BE ON THE STORAGE

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:54.662
SIDE AS WELL. AND WITH THAT

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:56.330
ENERGY USE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:57.498
GENERATE THAT POWER FROM

01:28:57.565 --> 01:28:59.233
SOMEWHERE SO THESE ARE PROJECTS

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:01.035
THAT INTERIOR GOING TO HAVE. AIR

01:29:01.102 --> 01:29:03.004
QUALITY IMPACTS ON ALREADY

01:29:03.071 --> 01:29:06.374
BURDENED COMMUNITIES- AND I WANT

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:09.577
TO BE. SURE THAT. I'M WE'RE NOT

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:14.315
EXTENDING. WERE SUBSIDIZING IN

01:29:14.382 --> 01:29:16.884
ANY WAY- PROJECTS THAT YOU KNOW

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:18.519
OR OTHERWISE DETRIMENTAL TO THE

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:21.989
COMMUNITY SO- I AM CONCERNED IF

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:24.358
WE'RE GOING TO BE SAY ENHANCING

01:29:24.425 --> 01:29:26.928
THE REVENUES OF AN OIL COMPANY.

01:29:26.994 --> 01:29:28.096
FOR THEIR ENHANCE STORE RECOVERY

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:30.031
PROJECT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

01:29:30.098 --> 01:29:32.133
TAKE CREDIT FOR IT FROM FORTY

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.135
FIVE Q. ON THE ONE END. AND THEN

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:36.003
FROM SB THIRTY TWO ON THE OTHER

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.472
AND THEN THE COMMUNITY ITSELF

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.941
WILL GET LEFT BEHIND AND SO

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.843
THAT'S THE SORT OF ESSENCE OF MY

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.878
CONCERN. BUT I JUST WANT TO. I

THINK THERE'S A WAY TO DO IT-

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:00.061
BUT BUT HAVING THOSE ASSURANCES

01:30:00.128 --> 01:30:01.863
AROUND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

01:30:01.929 --> 01:30:04.732
AND THEN HAVE IT BE HAVING SOME

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:05.767
CERTAINTY AROUND THE BROADER

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:07.235
CARBON PERMANENCE I THINK FOR

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:09.303

STEP BY THE WAY FOR THEIR DEEP

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:16.010

SOME TIME AND THIS. CAME UP- AND

01:30:30.258 --> 01:30:31.058
YOUR WORKING THROUGH THIS

01:30:31.125 --> 01:30:32.827
PROCESS SO I THINK YOU KNOW

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:37.231
COMMITTED. TO CONTINUING TO

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.199
NEGOTIATE AND- I JUST HAVE TO

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.034
GET CLEAR ON A FEW THINGS AND

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.103
ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- BUT THE

01:30:42.170 --> 01:30:43.037
FIRST IS OF COURSE ON THE

01:30:43.104 --> 01:30:44.806
ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY WANT TO BE

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:46.274
VERY CLEAR OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.041
STILL NEGOTIATING THAT. IT

01:30:47.108 --> 01:30:48.876
NEARLY IN THIS BILL IS IT AND AS

01:30:48.943 --> 01:30:52.113
AND AS IT IS IN PRINT JUST THE

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.148
PRIORITIZE IS AT THIS POINT. NOT

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:56.951
IT STILL ALLOWS ESSENTIALLY- SO

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:59.554
THAT TO ME IS A HUGE ISSUE JUST

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:00.388
GIVEN. A LOT OF THE

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:01.789
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE CONCERNS

01:31:01.856 --> 01:31:02.890
THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:31:02.957 --> 01:31:04.559
OBVIOUSLY I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT-

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:07.929
BUT WHAT. IS THE VISION FOR THIS

01:31:07.995 --> 01:31:10.131
IF IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENHANCED

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:13.501
OIL RECOVERY. I MEAN I KNOW WE

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:14.569
WANT TO REDUCE. EMISSIONS OF

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:17.305
COURSE BUT HOW I MEAN WHAT. AND

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.340
HOW DOES THAT REFLECT WHEN. WITH

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:20.675
THESE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:22.109
COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH I

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:24.078
REPRESENT YOU REPRESENT MANY OF

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.514
US DO. TO SELL THIS BACK HOME TO

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:27.882
SAY YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:29.050
THAT WE CAN INVEST IN KNOWING

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.484
THAT THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY ON

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:32.320
THE HORIZON THAT MAY BE MORE

01:31:32.386 --> 01:31:33.721
BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND I KNOW

01:31:33.788 --> 01:31:35.156
WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE

01:31:35.223 --> 01:31:36.657
CAN I'VE HEARD. LOUD AND CLEAR

01:31:36.724 --> 01:31:38.559
FROM EVERYONE WE HAVE TO DO

01:31:38.626 --> 01:31:39.493
EVERYTHING WE CAN. BUT WHAT WHAT

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.696
IS THAT VISION FOR THEM. THANK

01:31:41.762 --> 01:31:43.064
YOU FOR THE QUESTION I

01:31:43.130 --> 01:31:45.466
APPRECIATE IT. SO I THOUGHT THAT

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.035
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DID A

01:31:48.102 --> 01:31:50.204
REALLY ELEGANT. JOB OF THEM AND

01:31:50.271 --> 01:31:52.073
I AGREE WITH SENATOR STERN I

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.574
THOUGHT THE ANALYSIS WAS REALLY

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:54.942
WELL DONE IT'S A COMPLICATED

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:57.612
ISSUE. BECAUSE CARBON

01:31:57.678 --> 01:32:01.582
SEQUESTRATION CAN- CAN.

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:04.252
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE POLLUTION

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:05.052
IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:08.556
INDUSTRIES- SO LET ME JUST START

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.323
OFF BY SAYING IT'S NOT MY

01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:12.226
INTENT. WELL SO WITH THE FEDERAL

01:32:12.293 --> 01:32:13.261
GOVERNMENT HAS DONE I'M GOOD AT

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:14.929
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO DO WITH

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:16.864
THIS BILL RIGHT NOW- GIVEN THAT

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:17.899
WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE

01:32:17.965 --> 01:32:19.533
NEGOTIATION PROCESS. IS TO

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.135
MIRROR WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.037
GOVERNMENT IS DOING. BECAUSE

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:25.606
LIKE IT OR NOT IT IS IT IS

01:32:25.673 --> 01:32:27.174
COMING THEY ARE ACCEPTING

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.976
APPLICATIONS AND THEY'RE WORKING

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.380
THROUGH A PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO

01:32:32.446 --> 01:32:33.014
PERMIT- CARBON CAPTURE IN THE

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.982
STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND SO WE

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:38.452
NEED TO MEET THEM AS PARTNERS

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:39.620
AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW YOU

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.589
WANT IT TO OPERATE. FROM OUR

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:43.891
PERSPECTIVE AS WELL- THERE THERE

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:48.562
FUNDING PROGRAM IS- A TAX CREDIT

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.965
IT'S CALLED FORTY FIVE Q. AND

01:32:51.032 --> 01:32:52.967
THAT FORTY FIVE Q. AS IT AS I

01:32:53.034 --> 01:32:54.936
UNDERSTAND IT AS IT IS PASSED

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:57.104
TODAY THE FUNDING FOR THAT.DID

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:58.439
NOT INCLUDE ENHANCED OIL

01:32:58.506 --> 01:33:03.311
RECOVERY- I'M AND- M. IT MIGHT

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.546
MY COMMITMENT IN TERMS OF STATE

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:07.882
FUNDS AND MY A BILL DOES NOT

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:10.184
TALK. TO STATE FUNDS IT DOESN'T

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:14.188
INCLUDE A- A REQUIREMENT THAT

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.223
THE STATE PONY UP SOME MONEY I

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:17.224
EXPECT AT SOME POINT POINT WHAT

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:20.494
IT IT WILL BUT- IF IT DID IT IT

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:21.662
WOULD MAYOR THE FEDERAL

01:33:21.729 --> 01:33:27.868
GOVERNMENT- AND. NOT- NOT ALLOW

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.503
. THE STATE TO USE ANY OF THE

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:31.572
RESOURCES FOR ENHANCED OIL

01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:33.474
RECOVERY I THINK IT I THINK

01:33:33.541 --> 01:33:35.843
THAT'S THAT'S- CONSISTENT WITH

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:36.777
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND I'M

01:33:36.844 --> 01:33:42.583
OKAY WITH THAT- THE- ANY

01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:45.653
NEGOTIATION REQUIRES GIVE AND

01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:47.521
TAKE SO I GIVE YOU SOMETHING

01:33:47.588 --> 01:33:48.823
THAT I GET SOMETHING IN RETURN

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:49.991
AND SO THAT'S PART OF THE

01:33:50.057 --> 01:33:52.193
NEGOTIATION ON THE ENHANCED OIL

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:54.595
RECOVERY JUST AS A STATEMENT IN

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:56.697
A BILL- AND THAT'S PART OF THE

01:33:56.764 --> 01:33:58.065
NEGOTIATION I EXPECT IT'S GOING

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:00.167
TO BE FINISHED- AND THAT THAT

01:34:00.234 --> 01:34:02.169
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE TWO TO

01:34:02.236 --> 01:34:03.671
THREE WEEKS WILL HAVE THE

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:06.273
STATEMENT ABOUT WHERE WE WANT-

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:10.478
ALL ALL OF. OUR- DISCUSSION

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:12.613
ABOUT BOTH CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.082
BIOMASS AND IN OTHER WAYS TO

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:17.051
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE GRID

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.786
RELIABILITY. AND THAT WE'RE

01:34:18.853 --> 01:34:19.820
CLEANING OUR AIR AND WE'RE

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:22.089
MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS ALL OF

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:23.290
THAT WILL BE WILL BE WRAPPED UP

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:26.160
SO. AM I IT'S A IT'S A WAY

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:27.828
AROUND THE BACK DOOR TO EXPLAIN.

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:31.165
AN ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY BUT I'M

01:34:31.232 --> 01:34:34.201
IT IT IS NOT- I FIND THE

01:34:34.268 --> 01:34:35.936
EMPHASIZING ENERGY PRIORITIZING

01:34:36.003 --> 01:34:38.072
IT MAKING IT THE ABSOLUTE LAST

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:41.542
PRIORITY- S. AS THAT A COMMITTEE

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.177
AMENDMENT WAS IT WAS AN ELEGANT

01:34:43.244 --> 01:34:45.813
WAY TO DEAL WITH IT AND- YOU

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.681
KNOW BEEN FRANKLY I WANT I WANT

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:49.316
THE BILL TO MOVE SO THAT WE CAN

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.052
FINISH THE NEGOTIATIONS AND- AND

01:34:51.118 --> 01:34:54.922
THEN. TO DO WHATEVER WE NEED TO

01:34:54.989 --> 01:34:57.158
DO WITH ENHANCE OUR RECOVERY.

01:34:57.224 --> 01:34:58.359
YES AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE

01:34:58.426 --> 01:34:59.560
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THANK YOU

01:34:59.627 --> 01:35:01.262
FOR ALL OF THAT AND I THINK

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:02.630
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THE

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:03.964
ANALYSIS DID INCLUDE- A LOT OF

01:35:04.031 --> 01:35:05.266
GREAT INFORMATION I THINK FOR ME

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:07.568
AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE NEW

01:35:07.635 --> 01:35:09.470
TECH I WAS TRY TO LOOK AHEAD YOU

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.738
KNOW. THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WHAT

01:35:10.805 --> 01:35:13.174
CAN BE IMPROVED- AND HOW WE CAN

01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:14.542
ENSURE THAT THERE'S JOBS THERE

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:16.377
BUT THAT ARE ALSO REDUCING IN

01:35:16.444 --> 01:35:18.245
CAPTURING EMISSIONS DOING BOTH

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:19.246
NOT JUST THE REDUCTION BUT

01:35:19.313 --> 01:35:21.348
CAPTURING MA'AM AND- DOING ALL

01:35:21.415 --> 01:35:23.784
OF THAT BUT- I THINK SENATOR

01:35:23.851 --> 01:35:25.553
WHITE HOUSE GET MENTIONED IN HIS

01:35:25.619 --> 01:35:26.921
BILL I THINK BECAUSE THERE'S

01:35:26.987 --> 01:35:27.955
QUITE A FEW MOVING IN THE

01:35:28.022 --> 01:35:29.223
LEGISLATURE AS WE KNOW. THERE

01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:31.992
IS- A HE'S LOOKING AT THE NEW

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:35.096
TECHNOLOGY SORT OF SIDE OF

01:35:35.162 --> 01:35:36.964
THINGS AT A TO BE HOUSED WITHIN

01:35:37.031 --> 01:35:38.299
THE ENERGY COMMISSION WHICH I

01:35:38.365 --> 01:35:39.867
THINK THIS MIGHT BE YOU KNOW

01:35:39.934 --> 01:35:41.702
BETTER OPPORTUNITY BUT I DON'T

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:44.572
KNOW WHAT OTHER. IT I DON'T KNOW

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.340
IF MAYBE YOUR SUPPORTERS AS WELL

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:48.109
COULD MAYBE ANSWER THIS TO LIKE

01:35:48.175 --> 01:35:49.376
WHAT IS THE HORIZON FOR THAT NEW

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:50.511
TECHNOLOGY AND HEARING DIFFERENT

01:35:50.578 --> 01:35:52.413
THINGS LIKE WHAT CAN WE LOOK FOR

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:54.815
TO IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE FOR

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:57.685
THAT STRATEGY HORIZON. IN IN NEW

01:35:57.751 --> 01:36:00.121
TECHNOLOGY- I MY EXPERT ON THE

01:36:00.187 --> 01:36:03.424
ON THE PHONE I'M NOT SURE SHE

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.426
SAID ON THE PHONE- BUT- I'D BE

01:36:05.493 --> 01:36:08.129
HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. I

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:10.097
CAN ANSWER IT MYSELF I WHAT I DO

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:12.266
KNOW HERE HERE'S HERE'S- MY

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:15.102
ANALYSIS OF THAT. OF AN ANSWER

01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:18.572
THAT'S NOT TOTALLY COMPLETE BUT-

01:36:18.639 --> 01:36:20.574
ONE OF THE ONE OF THE- THE

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.143
THINGS I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:24.044
IMPORTANT IS. A GRID RELIABILITY

01:36:24.111 --> 01:36:25.379
FOR ME MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

01:36:25.446 --> 01:36:26.747
CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.282
WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE

01:36:28.349 --> 01:36:30.317
INTO A GREEN TECHNOLOGY. AT THE

01:36:30.384 --> 01:36:32.186
LEVEL AT WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:33.954
TRAINED RATHER THAN AT A AT A

01:36:34.021 --> 01:36:36.023
REALLY LOWER LEVEL WHERE THEY

01:36:36.090 --> 01:36:37.224
CANNOT SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES.

01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:38.659
BUT THE OTHER PART IS TO SIGNAL

01:36:38.726 --> 01:36:40.628
TO THE MARKET IF THIS IS

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:41.295
SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:43.931
COMMITTED TO. SO THAT WE GET THE

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.432
INVESTMENT APART FROM THE STATE

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:48.702
OF CALIFORNIA- IN TECHNOLOGY

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:50.704
THAT WILL HELP US TO ACHIEVE OUR

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:53.440
GOALS AND THAT'S- THAT'S PART OF

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.075
A TICKET REALLY BEING ABLE TO

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:56.911
SAY WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:57.978
ABLE TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS WE

01:36:58.045 --> 01:36:59.213
SET GOALS WITHOUT KNOWING IF

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:01.115
WE'D EVER GET THERE. AND WE SET

01:37:01.182 --> 01:37:02.850
GOALS WITHOUT HAVING ANY OF THE

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.118
TECHNOLOGY. THAT WOULD THAT YOU

01:37:04.185 --> 01:37:05.219
COULD POINT TO SAY WE'RE GONNA

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:07.354
GET THERE- WE JUST KNEW WE HAD

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.089
TO WE HAD TO DO IT AND THIS IS

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:10.991
PART OF THAT. THAT MOVEMENT

01:37:11.058 --> 01:37:12.526
WHICH IS TO SIGNAL TO THE MARKET

01:37:12.593 --> 01:37:17.131
THE CALIFORNIA IS- IS. WE EXPECT

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.666
THE HIGHEST QUALITY WE EXPECT

01:37:18.732 --> 01:37:20.367
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET YOUR-

01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:23.370
YOUR- YOUR TARGETS AND- WILL

01:37:23.437 --> 01:37:25.239
HOLD YOU TO THEM. AND WHAT WILL

01:37:25.306 --> 01:37:26.874
SET SOME REAL HIGH STANDARDS FOR

01:37:26.941 --> 01:37:28.842
IT AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO THE

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.878
BEST AND SO THAT'S WHY THIS IS.

01:37:30.945 --> 01:37:32.313
IS SO IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.181
REALLY DOES CREATE AN

01:37:34.248 --> 01:37:36.317
OPPORTUNITY TO. TO HAVE THE

01:37:36.383 --> 01:37:37.685
INVESTMENT HAPPENING CALIFORNIA

01:37:37.751 --> 01:37:39.787
AND TO HAVE IT IT- ARE LEADING

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:42.022
SCIENTISTS INVOLVED. AND AS YOU

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.791
KNOW WE HAVE OUR MAJOR

01:37:43.857 --> 01:37:45.559
UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE WORKING ON

01:37:45.626 --> 01:37:48.295
ON ON THIS ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:51.966
THAT ARE ARE. TALKING ABOUT IT.

01:37:52.032 --> 01:37:54.201
I THINK THERE I AM FROM ANOTHER

01:37:54.268 --> 01:37:55.703
A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO TALK ABOUT

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:56.937
ARE THINGS LIKE DIRECT AIR

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.939
CAPTURE AND THE HYDROGEN ECONOMY

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:01.175
AND HONESTLY- DIRECTOR CAPTURED

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:02.943
CAPTURED HERE TO FROM AMBIENT

01:38:03.010 --> 01:38:04.845
AIR YOU'LL STILL NEED A PLACE TO

01:38:04.912 --> 01:38:06.347
PUT IT USED ON THE THAT'S THE

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:07.548
QUESTION- AT THAT IS SOMETHING

01:38:07.615 --> 01:38:09.717
THAT IS COMING IN THE FUTURE IT

01:38:09.783 --> 01:38:11.051
WILL BE HUGE HOWEVER WE STILL

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:12.152
NEED TO GET THE GEOLOGIC

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:13.153
SEQUESTRATION PROGRAM UP AND

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:17.324
RUNNING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.459
ADVANTAGE OF THINGS LIKE THAT IN

01:38:18.525 --> 01:38:20.561
THE FUTURE. I THINK THAT CHRIS

01:38:20.628 --> 01:38:22.263
HAD SOMETHING ELSE TO MENTION AS

01:38:22.329 --> 01:38:29.570
WELL. THE YOU KNOW SERWIS-

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:30.037
REPRESENTATION OF NEW

01:38:30.104 --> 01:38:32.539
TECHNOLOGIES. THERE THERE'S MANY

01:38:32.606 --> 01:38:33.874
DIFFERENT AREAS WERE GREENHOUSE

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:36.043
GASES ARE EMITTED SOME IS FROM

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:38.145
TRANSPORTATION SOME AS FROM-

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.180
ENERGY PRODUCTION SOME IS FOR

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:42.149
MANUFACTURING SOMERS FROM

01:38:42.216 --> 01:38:44.551
AGRICULTURE- THERE'S THERE ARE

01:38:44.618 --> 01:38:46.153
CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING

01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.822
TO BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER WITH

01:38:48.889 --> 01:38:50.524
GREEN HYDROGEN STEEL PRODUCTION-

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.993
CEMENT PRODUCTION BUT YOU CANNOT

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.462
ELIMINATE- GREENHOUSE GASES

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:58.132
COMPLETELY YESTERDAY I WAS AT A

01:38:58.198 --> 01:39:00.301
GROUNDBREAKING FOR A LIGHT RAIL

01:39:00.367 --> 01:39:03.003
LINE IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.638
WHICH IS GONNA NEED STEEL IT'S

01:39:04.705 --> 01:39:06.540
GONNA NEED CONCRETE. TO BE ABLE

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.609
TO HELP US MOVE TRANSPORTATION

01:39:08.676 --> 01:39:10.577
AND MOVE CLEANER TRANSPORTATION

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:13.347
BUT WE STILL NEED STEEL AND WE

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:14.081
NEED STILL THAT'S PRODUCED

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:16.283
LOCALLY WE STILL NEED CONCRETE

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:18.319
AND THERE THERE'S JUST CERTAIN

01:39:18.385 --> 01:39:20.187
THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO I MET

01:39:20.254 --> 01:39:22.489
GREENHOUSE GASES CARBON CAPTURE

01:39:22.556 --> 01:39:24.291
MITIGATES THOSE AND THAT'S THE

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:26.093
TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE NOW WE'RE

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:27.061
GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING

01:39:27.127 --> 01:39:29.530
TOGETHER LIKE WE ARE IN THE

01:39:29.596 --> 01:39:31.165
APPLICATION. TO EXPAND GREEN

01:39:31.231 --> 01:39:33.100
HIGHER CHEN AND HAVE CALIFORNIA

NATURISTS HORSES AND I WOULD.

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:50.778

IT'S NOT A STANDALONE BILL

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:12.132
BECAUSE IT'S PART OF THE BROADER

01:41:12.199 --> 01:41:13.634
CONTEXT OF THIS. CLIMATE WORKING

01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:15.035

SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I'VE

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:35.889
BEEN RAISED BY. THE CHAIR OF

01:41:35.956 --> 01:41:39.293

ENSURING AND I WAS ABOUT A LOT

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:50.103
OF FRIENDS FROM THE OIL INDUSTRY

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.638
THAT ARE HERE THAT ARE VERY

01:41:51.705 --> 01:41:53.006

PRESENTED AS A PRO CLIMATE

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:58.645
MEASURE RIGHT WE NEED TO. ENGAGE

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.147

TRADES- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:08.989
SURE THIS IS NOT USED AS A-

01:42:09.056 --> 01:42:10.691
EXCUSE TO OR OR OR JUSTIFICATION

01:42:10.757 --> 01:42:13.293
FOR. DOUBLING DOWN ON. ON FOSSIL

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.863
FUELS. ARE WHICH WE NOW ARE YOU

01:42:15.929 --> 01:42:17.564
KNOW SUCH A DRAMATIC CONTRIBUTOR

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:18.665
TO THE CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT'S

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:20.367
I THINK THE CHALLENGE HERE RIGHT

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:21.568
ABOUT THAT SADDAM'S WITH YOUR

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:24.004
BILL TO BE HONEST. I'M GIVEN THE

01:42:24.071 --> 01:42:25.105
POSTURE OF OUR COMMITTEE AND OUR

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:27.441
CONCERNS HERE ON ON ON THE

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:30.577
CLIMATE ISSUES AND SO. ON IF I

01:42:30.644 --> 01:42:32.179
COULD I GUESS PLEASE I AGREE

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:34.615
WITH THAT I MEAN I DO I A. M. I

01:42:34.681 --> 01:42:39.686
UNDERSTAND. THE CONCERN- I THINK

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:42.122
THAT THAT THE BILL RIGHT NOW. IT

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:46.426
DOESN'T- IT IT IT'S NOT A SIGNAL

01:42:46.493 --> 01:42:49.229
THAT THAT YOU ARE IS- THE

01:42:49.296 --> 01:42:51.365
ENHANCE OUR RECOVERY IS-

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:52.399
SOMETHING THAT EITHER IS GOING

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.167
TO BE FUNDED BY THE STATE OR

01:42:54.234 --> 01:42:55.969
THIS GOING TO BE PART OF THE

01:42:56.036 --> 01:42:57.771
FRAMEWORK THAT WE'RE WORKING ON

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:03.644
HERE TODAY- BUT- AND I HATE.

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:04.478
WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR IS A

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:07.814
TRANSITION AWAY FROM. FOSSIL

01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.850
FUELS THAT GIVES US SOME STEPS

01:43:09.917 --> 01:43:11.985
TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE. I'M

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.021
NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS. I

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.023
THINK I THINK ALL THE EXPERTS

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:18.825
AGREE. THAT WE CAN'T REACH OUR

01:43:18.892 --> 01:43:20.594
CLIMATE GOALS GIVEN WHERE WE'RE

01:43:20.661 --> 01:43:23.030
AT TODAY. ME NOT THAT I HAVEN'T

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:24.298
HEARD ANY DISAGREEMENT WHERE

01:43:24.364 --> 01:43:26.166
PEOPLE SAY YEAH YOU COULD- AND

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.101
YOU CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT THAT

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:29.937
IS IN A CRIPPLING THE ECONOMY.

01:43:30.003 --> 01:43:32.306
AND SO WE NEED TO I MEAN THAT

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.840
THIS IS IF THERE'S ONE THING

01:43:33.907 --> 01:43:35.275
ABOUT CALIFORNIA IT'S THAT WE'RE

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:37.344
WE'RE RISK TAKERS AND WE GET OUT

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:38.345
THERE WE GET THINGS DONE. RIGHT

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:40.847
I GUESS WE DO WANT TO BE CAREFUL

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:41.982
TO CONSIDER THE RISK RIGHT I

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.017
MEAN I GUESS ABSOLUTE I GUESS

01:43:44.084 --> 01:43:45.719
THE QUESTION IS THAT HOW DO WE

01:43:45.786 --> 01:43:47.020
MAKE I MEAN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.022
THAT THAT. YOUR EFFORTS. I'M

01:43:49.089 --> 01:43:52.225
DON'T END UP- LOCKING IN LIKE A

01:43:52.292 --> 01:43:54.094
LONGER TERM DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL

01:43:54.161 --> 01:43:59.933
FUEL. I DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.706
FUELS VIA I MEAN I IT'S C. I.

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:09.409
CALIFORNIA I MEAN I LOOK AT IT

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.645
AS- WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:15.215
BE GREENER. BUT BUT BUT PART OF

01:44:15.282 --> 01:44:16.883
THAT COMMITMENT HAS BEEN TO

01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:21.221
EXCLUDE. SOLUTIONS BETTER

01:44:21.288 --> 01:44:24.257
LOGICAL AND THEY GET US THE IN

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:26.093
IN IN INCREMENTAL STEPS TO WHERE

01:44:26.159 --> 01:44:28.629
WE WANT TO GO. AND IT'S EITHER

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:31.131
SOLAR OR ITS WIND AND THAT'S ALL

01:44:31.198 --> 01:44:33.033
THERE IS AND YOU KNOW WHAT

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.035
WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS WE

01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:37.671
NEVER TALK ABOUT THEM WILDLIFE

01:44:37.738 --> 01:44:40.073
IMPACTS OF THOSE TWO TYPES OF

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:43.076
ENERGY. I DON'T ONE IS YOU KNOW

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:44.945
MAKE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT BUT

01:44:45.012 --> 01:44:46.647
WHEN YOU'RE KILLING BIRDS AND

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:47.814
THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE HAVING

01:44:47.881 --> 01:44:52.986
TO. TECT SOLAR- ARRAYS BY

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:55.288
PUTTING UP FENCES YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:44:55.355 --> 01:44:56.957
YOU'RE DISTURBING WILDLIFE

01:44:57.024 --> 01:44:58.592
YOU'RE NOT YEAH- ALLOWING THE

01:44:58.659 --> 01:44:59.926
LAND IS WHY YOU'RE BIG

01:44:59.993 --> 01:45:00.894
SUPPORTIVE ROOFTOP SO INSTEAD OF

01:45:00.961 --> 01:45:02.996
IT DOES YEAH ABSOLUTELY I AM I

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.831
AM OKAY I'M A BIG SUPPORTER OF

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:06.767
THE P. S. B. YOU SEE THAT NO I

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:08.435
WILL I WILL CERTAINLY BUT BUT

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:10.070
BUT BUT IT'S GOT ENVIRONMENTAL

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:13.774
CONSEQUENCES AND SO WE CAN'T BE

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:16.943
PURISTS IN THAT IN THE IN THE

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:19.346
STRICTEST SENSE WE'VE GOT TO BE

01:45:19.413 --> 01:45:21.314
LOGICAL IT'S GOTTA MAKE SENSE

01:45:21.381 --> 01:45:23.116
WE'VE GT TO BE DOING THINGS

01:45:23.183 --> 01:45:26.186
THAT- THAT WE WERE WE TO REDUCE

01:45:26.253 --> 01:45:28.455
THE RISK THE RISK OF BLACKOUTS

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:31.658
AND BROWNOUTS- THE RISK. THAT

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:33.960
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PAY. THE

01:45:34.027 --> 01:45:35.395
RATES ARE GOING TO BE SO HIGH

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.597
THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EATEN NOT

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:38.765
ECONOMICAL FOR THEM AND HEATER

01:45:38.832 --> 01:45:40.567
OR TO CALL THEIR THEIR UNITS IN

01:45:40.634 --> 01:45:42.402
IN MY DISTRICT HAS SOME OF THE

01:45:42.469 --> 01:45:43.937
HOTTEST TEMPERATURES IN THE

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.072
SUMMER IN THE COLDEST

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:46.840
TEMPERATURES IN THE WINTER. SO I

01:45:46.907 --> 01:45:49.109
WANT A GRADE THAT'S RELIABLE I

01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:52.179
WANT. JAVA JOBS FOR PEOPLE AND I

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:54.147
AND I WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:45:54.214 --> 01:45:55.315
TRANSITION NATURALLY WITHOUT

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:57.384
HAVING TO CREATE A FUND. SO THAT

01:45:57.451 --> 01:45:59.553
WHEN THEY BECOME UNEMPLOYED WE

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.021
GIVE THEM A HAND OUT THAT'S ONE

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:02.322
HUNDRED AND YOURSELF. PARDON ME

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:04.024
OF EQUITY FUND IS IN THE BILL

01:46:04.091 --> 01:46:05.158
YOU'RE DOING WITH CENTER LAYERED

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:07.360
IT IS NOT IT IS THAT THERE THIRD

01:46:07.427 --> 01:46:09.196
THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF

01:46:09.262 --> 01:46:11.131
MOVING PIECES AND SO THE- I MEAN

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:13.233
YES THAT WE GOT TO THAT RIGHT

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:14.768
AWAY AND I WILL TELL YOU MY

01:46:14.835 --> 01:46:16.036
FRUSTRATION IS THAT. WE PUT

01:46:16.103 --> 01:46:17.904
CARBON CAPTURE BECAUSE IT WAS SO

01:46:17.971 --> 01:46:19.406
CLOSE SO COMPLICATED AS ONE OF

01:46:19.473 --> 01:46:21.441
THE LAST THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.610
AND WE IT'S JUST HASN'T HAPPENED

01:46:23.677 --> 01:46:25.946
AND SO. YEAH IT'S A IT'S A

01:46:26.012 --> 01:46:27.280
CIRCUMSTANCE OF TIMING AND SO I

01:46:27.347 --> 01:46:31.885
DO A POP I UNDERSTAND. HOW HOW-

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.820
HOW CHALLENGE THIS IS- FOR SOME

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:35.455
PEOPLE BUT I'M JUST ASKING FOR

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:38.191
SOME PRACTICAL- AT FIRST FOR A

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:40.393
PRACTICAL. LOOK AT HOW THIS

01:46:40.460 --> 01:46:42.262
WOULD WORK. AND WE'RE NOT DONE

01:46:42.329 --> 01:46:44.431
YET. YOU KNOW WHAT. I'VE GOT TO

01:46:44.498 --> 01:46:46.967
GET PAST AS SENATOR STERN. YOU

01:46:47.033 --> 01:46:50.937

TECHNOLOGY PROMISES A LOT AND

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.195
DOESN'T END UP DELIVERING IN ITS

GO IN CALIFORNIA LEADING AS A

01:49:39.205 --> 01:49:40.307
STATE AND TRYING TO LEAD THE

01:49:40.373 --> 01:49:42.909
WORLD. IN THIS DIRECTION WE PUT

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:46.279
WE PRODUCE 1% OF THE GHG FOR THE

01:49:46.346 --> 01:49:50.850
WORLD. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TARGET

01:49:50.917 --> 01:49:51.985

COMBUSTIBLE. NOT FOR SALE IN

01:49:56.489 --> 01:49:59.259
CALIFORNIA CARS THAT ARE USED

01:49:59.326 --> 01:50:00.260
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS THAT IS

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:02.963
AGGRESSIVE. WHEN WE HAVE A GREAT

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:05.165

LOVE SOLAR WE LOVE NGUYEN.

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:11.805
BIOMASS NOT SO MUCH A LOT OF A

01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:13.139
LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE DON'T

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:15.208
LIKE THAT EVEN THOUGH. WE KNOW

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:17.377
THAT WE CAN SEQUESTER CARBON AT

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.611
A HIGHER RATE WE ACTUALLY THIN

01:50:18.678 --> 01:50:19.980
THE FOREST. BECAUSE THE TREES

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.448
GROW FASTER NAY SEQUESTER CARBON

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:24.417
THAT CARBON STORAGE. AND WE

01:50:24.484 --> 01:50:25.051
DON'T LOOK AT THAT AND THEN AND

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:27.320
THEN INTO. THE SENATOR STERN'S

01:50:27.387 --> 01:50:29.022
COMMENTS ABOUT WE BUY THOSE

01:50:29.089 --> 01:50:30.924
CREDITS IN AN IT BURNS UP AND

01:50:30.991 --> 01:50:32.625
THEN WE WOULD- THOSE THOSE ARE

01:50:32.692 --> 01:50:33.827
CONVERSATIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:50:33.893 --> 01:50:35.195
HAD. A LONG BEFORE WE'RE HERE

01:50:35.261 --> 01:50:38.665
WE'RE AT TODAY. AND WE DON'T

01:50:38.732 --> 01:50:39.799
HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WE SET

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:41.267
TARGETS. AS CALIFORNIA'S IN THE

01:50:41.334 --> 01:50:43.136
TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE'RE

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:45.205
GOING. AND SO I COMMEND YOU. FOR

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:46.773
TAKING ON A TOPIC AND I KNOW

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.008
THERE ARE SOME OTHER MEMBERS

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:49.376
THAT ARE CARRYING LEGISLATION

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.011
BUT I THINK AT THE END OF THE

01:50:51.077 --> 01:50:53.413
DAY. AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN

01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:54.714
IT COMES TO CALIFORNIANS. WHO

01:50:54.781 --> 01:50:59.019
ARE. DEALING WITH THE COST OF

01:50:59.085 --> 01:51:01.554
FUEL TODAY. BECAUSE OF OUR

01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:05.325
POLICIES. AND THEN LET'S TALK

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:06.626
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT WHEN WE

01:51:06.693 --> 01:51:11.531
IMPORT. OIL FROM ECUADOR HAS NO

01:51:11.598 --> 01:51:13.833
REGULATIONS ON IT AT ALL LIKE

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:14.701
THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:51:14.768 --> 01:51:17.504
DESTROYING THE AMAZON RAINFOREST

01:51:17.570 --> 01:51:20.974
WHILE WE HAVE. LABOR AND FOLKS

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:23.743
WHO CAN EXTRACT OIL IN

01:51:23.810 --> 01:51:24.844
CALIFORNIA'S SAFER THAN ANYWHERE

01:51:24.911 --> 01:51:27.280
IN THE WORLD. AND NOT HAVE TO

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:29.449
PUT IT ON A SHIP. BRING IT HERE

01:51:29.516 --> 01:51:31.785
AND WE FIND IT HERE. THIS IS

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.353
CYCLE THAT'S CRAZY WHAT WE

01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:34.354
TALKING ABOUT HERE LET'S TALK

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.623
COMMON SENSE AND THUS GET DOWN

01:51:36.689 --> 01:51:39.459
AND WORK ON THESE ISSUES AND-

01:51:39.526 --> 01:51:42.662
STOP ARE BIASED TOWARDS. ONE

01:51:42.729 --> 01:51:45.198
TECHNOLOGY OR OR ANOTHER. AND

01:51:45.265 --> 01:51:46.900
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING

01:51:46.966 --> 01:51:49.335

TO GET IS I'D LOVE TO GET TO.

01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:54.107
ELECTRIC CARS BY TWENTY THIRTY

01:51:54.174 --> 01:51:55.675
FIVE BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:57.010
THERE BECAUSE OUR GRID. IS NOT

01:51:57.077 --> 01:51:58.912
THE SHAPE IT NEEDS TO BE IN WE

01:51:58.978 --> 01:52:00.847
QUITE FRANKLY BILL TRANSMISSION

01:52:00.914 --> 01:52:02.048
LINES IN THE STATE. WE ARE OVER

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.883
PRODUCING POWER. IN SOME PARTS

01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:05.185
OF OUR STATE BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:06.953
MORE SOLAR THERE THAN AND WE

01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.789
CAN'T GET THE POWER TO WHERE WE

01:52:09.856 --> 01:52:10.557
NEED IT. DURING THE TIME OF DAY

01:52:10.623 --> 01:52:12.392
THAT WE NEED ALL WE HAVE TO DO

01:52:12.459 --> 01:52:13.159
IS. BUILD A TRANSMISSION LINE.

01:52:13.226 --> 01:52:15.428
AND WE HAVE THE LABOR FORCE TO

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.430
DO IT. BUT WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:18.098
THE ENVIRONMENT HE STOPS LL

01:52:18.164 --> 01:52:20.300
THOSE. BOTH WAYS TO GET THERE IF

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.168
YOU REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:23.036
THE ENVIRONMENT TO LOOK AT THE

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:23.970
STATE HOLISTICALLY. AND SAY

01:52:24.037 --> 01:52:26.372
WHERE DO WE NEED THE POWER WHEN

01:52:26.439 --> 01:52:27.907
WE NEED IT AND- HOW ARE WE GOING

01:52:27.974 --> 01:52:29.943
TO GET THERE SO. I'VE BEEN SO

01:52:30.009 --> 01:52:31.945
FRUSTRATED OVER THE YEARS

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:32.479
SITTING ON THIS COMMITTEE

01:52:32.545 --> 01:52:33.146
TALKING ABOUT ONE. ONE SOLUTION.

01:52:33.213 --> 01:52:34.848
TO A REALLY COMPLICATED PROBLEM.

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:37.050
STATEWIDE I THINK YOU'RE ON TO

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:38.151
SOMETHING HERE AND I THINK WHEN

01:52:38.218 --> 01:52:40.753
YOU TALK ABOUT OIL. I THINK WE

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:41.988
NEED TO TALK ABOUT. CALIFORNIA

01:52:42.055 --> 01:52:43.823
WILL. PRODUCING OIL HERE UNTIL

01:52:43.890 --> 01:52:45.525
WE CAN GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE

01:52:45.592 --> 01:52:47.560
DON'T NEED IT. WHICH WE WILL

01:52:47.627 --> 01:52:48.528
NEVER GET THERE. YOU'RE NOT

01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:49.195
GONNA FLY ELECTRIC PLANUM TELL

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:51.231
YOU THAT RIGHT NOW. IT'S NOT

01:52:51.297 --> 01:52:52.765
GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN ONLINE. YEAH

01:52:52.832 --> 01:52:53.933
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN SO LET'S

BE REAL AND LET'S BE HONEST WITH

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.804
CALIFORNIANS. BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.339
QUESTIONING WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:00.940
HERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD

01:53:01.007 --> 01:53:02.375
TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.144
THE ELECTRIC RATES ARE HIGH.

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:07.480
THEIR FUEL IS HIGH AND IT'S

01:53:07.547 --> 01:53:08.548
BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT COME

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.517
OUT HERE. SO I'M ON YOUR TEAM

01:53:10.583 --> 01:53:12.085
I'M GONNA VOTE FOR YOUR BILL

01:53:12.152 --> 01:53:13.920
TODAY AND I'M I KNOW ONE IS SEND

01:53:13.987 --> 01:53:15.088
A MESSAGE TO THE LABOR

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:16.122
COMMUNITY. INTO THE OIL

01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:18.391
COMMUNITY. BECAUSE THEY'RE LINED

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:22.495
UP TODAY. BUT WE NEED WE NEED

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:23.863
REAL SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO TALK

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:27.467
ABOUT. THE GRID. WHEN YOU TALK

01:53:27.534 --> 01:53:30.303
ABOUT BIOMASS WE NEED TO TALK

01:53:30.370 --> 01:53:31.971
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE TO

01:53:32.038 --> 01:53:34.140
REEK TO CAPTURE FROM THESE ARE

01:53:34.207 --> 01:53:36.009
ALL SHOULD BE IN THIS IN THESE

01:53:36.075 --> 01:53:37.777
TALKING POINTS AND I KNOW THAT

01:53:37.844 --> 01:53:38.845
IT'S GOING TO NOT TO RESOURCES

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:40.180
WERE A LOT OF THAT CONVERSATION

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:42.115
IS GOING TO BE HAD BUT WE CAN'T

01:53:42.182 --> 01:53:43.716
JUST BE PURIST IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:44.984
SAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE THAT

01:53:45.051 --> 01:53:47.320
WE'RE GONNA DO IT THIS WAY WHEN

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:49.722
IT'S REALLY COMPLICATED AND WE-

01:53:49.789 --> 01:53:50.990
WE NEED TO WEAN OURSELVES. OFF

01:53:51.057 --> 01:53:54.127
OF. THESE PRODUCTS THAT WE USE

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:55.595
IN A MANNER THAT KEEPS

01:53:55.662 --> 01:53:57.430
CALIFORNIANS. ABLE TO LIVE HERE

01:53:57.497 --> 01:53:59.899

HOURLY WAGE EARNER. YOU HAVE THE

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:15.048
SAME PROBLEM. WE NEED TO FOCUS

01:54:15.114 --> 01:54:16.149
ON THOSE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:54:16.216 --> 01:54:18.051

GOING WITH THE BILL YEAH- HEY.

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.871
FIVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS SO

01:55:11.938 --> 01:55:16.609
SEVERE WE NEED EVERY TOOL AND WE

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:20.346
ARE I AM A COMPLETE- IT

01:55:20.413 --> 01:55:22.382
COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:24.150
TRANSITIONING OFF FOSSIL FUELS

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:25.385
BUT WE ARE IN THE MIDST RIGHT

01:55:25.451 --> 01:55:29.422
NOW OF STILL NEEDING. WHETHER

01:55:29.489 --> 01:55:31.691
IT'S CEMENT CONCRETE STEEL YOU

01:55:31.758 --> 01:55:35.194
NAME IT FOUR WHETHER IT'S TO-

01:55:35.261 --> 01:55:37.230
YOU KNOW FIX OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.766
BUILD NEW HOUSING. AND WE'RE NOT

01:55:39.832 --> 01:55:41.534
AT THE PLACE WHERE WE HAVE

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:44.137
EITHER FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:45.838
THOSE PRODUCTIONS WITHOUT ANY

01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:47.974
FOSSIL FUEL OR WITHOUT ANY

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:50.543
CARBON EMISSIONS I MEAN CEMENT

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:51.744
FOR EXAMPLE HAS IT IN PROCESS

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:55.748
EMISSIONS- AND- YET WE CAN'T

01:55:55.815 --> 01:55:56.616
AFFORD TO HAVE THAT CARBON GOING

01:55:56.683 --> 01:55:58.451
TO THE ATMOSPHERE. NOW CARBON

01:55:58.518 --> 01:56:00.253
CAPTURE AND STORAGE IS A

01:56:00.320 --> 01:56:03.022
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS. IT HAS I

01:56:03.089 --> 01:56:05.858
THINK ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE- UTILITY

01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:07.927
GRADE BATTERIES WHEN I DID THE

01:56:07.994 --> 01:56:09.662
BILL ON UTILITY GREED BATTERIES

01:56:09.729 --> 01:56:10.963
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE.

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:13.299
HE WORKED AVAILABLE THEY WERE

01:56:13.366 --> 01:56:15.468
POLITE YET THEY WERE IN YET NOW

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:17.704
CALIFORNIA'S THE LEADER AND

01:56:17.770 --> 01:56:22.742
UTILIZED- GLOBALLY AND- WE HAVE

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:25.244
TO GET TO THAT PLACE WITH CARBON

01:56:25.311 --> 01:56:28.548
CAPTURE AND STORAGE. NOT AS A

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:31.517
REPLACEMENT TO REDUCTION. BUT IN

01:56:31.584 --> 01:56:32.885
THE NORWEGIAN THAT WE HAVE TO

01:56:32.952 --> 01:56:34.954
GET KEEP THAT CARBON FROM

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.290
GETTING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO

01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:37.824
THAT'S WHY I'M GOING TO BE

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:40.226
SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. I DO NOT

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:41.627
WANT TO USE CARBON CAPTURE AND

01:56:41.694 --> 01:56:44.931
STORAGE AT ALL FOR- ENHANCED OIL

01:56:44.997 --> 01:56:46.666
RECOVERY I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:56:46.733 --> 01:56:48.568
APPROPRIATE BUT I DO THINK IT'S

01:56:48.634 --> 01:56:50.236
APPROPRIATE TO USE IT IN CERTAIN

01:56:50.303 --> 01:56:52.572
OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES. THAT FOR

01:56:52.638 --> 01:56:53.940
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW

01:56:54.006 --> 01:56:57.877
ONCE WE'VE- FULLY EITHER VENICE

01:56:57.944 --> 01:56:59.846
SUFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THEM

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:02.014
OR- YOU KNOW FULLY REDUCE THE

01:57:02.081 --> 01:57:03.416
EMISSIONS AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

01:57:03.483 --> 01:57:07.186
THAT WE UTILIZE THIS AND WE SEE

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:08.521
OTHER COUNTRIES BEGINNING TO

01:57:08.588 --> 01:57:10.189
MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS WE

01:57:10.256 --> 01:57:11.824
SEE A LOT OF RESEARCH THERE'S A

01:57:11.891 --> 01:57:13.092
GREAT REPORT IT CITED THE

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:14.827
ANALYSIS FROM LAWRENCE BERKELEY

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:19.065
NATIONAL LAB- AND I. TOTALLY

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:22.935
APPRECIATE THE FIERCE THAT. IT

01:57:23.002 --> 01:57:24.704
WOULD POTENTIALLY PROP UP THE

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.672
FOSSIL FUEL SYSTEM BUT I DON'T

01:57:26.739 --> 01:57:28.641
THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE THE

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:30.610
CASE I THINK WE ARE IN THAT

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:32.445
TRANSITION BUT THAT TRANSITIONS

01:57:32.512 --> 01:57:34.614
GOING TO TAKE AWHILE AND WE NEED

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:35.982
TO GET THE CARBON PREVENTED FROM

01:57:36.048 --> 01:57:40.586
GOING THE ATMOSPHERE. SO. AGAIN

01:57:40.653 --> 01:57:42.288
I APPRECIATE THAT FOR SOME

01:57:42.355 --> 01:57:44.257
PEOPLE THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

01:57:44.323 --> 01:57:45.558
TECHNOLOGIES THAT SHOULD BE

01:57:45.625 --> 01:57:47.326
LIKE- NEVER TOUCH IT HANDS OFF

01:57:47.393 --> 01:57:50.263
BUT I THINK WE- THE CRISIS IS SO

01:57:50.329 --> 01:57:53.766
SEVERE RIGHT NOW. THAT WE HAVE

01:57:53.833 --> 01:57:54.867
GOT TO USE EVERY TOOL IN THE

01:57:54.934 --> 01:57:56.903
TOOLKIT. AND THAT'S WHY I'M

01:57:56.969 --> 01:57:59.038
SUPPORTING IT BUT AS I SAID WELL

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:01.441
THE BILL DOESN'T COMPLETELY

01:58:01.507 --> 01:58:04.677
PROHIBIT. THE OIL AND GAS I MEAN

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.679
THE OIL RECOVERY. ENHANCED OIL

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.281
RECOVERY I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:10.149
IT DOESN'T GET UTILIZED FOR THAT

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:12.251
PURPOSE BUT I CERTAINLY. THINK

01:58:12.318 --> 01:58:14.153
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR MOST AT

01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:16.389
OTHER OF OUR TECHNOLOGIES AND-

01:58:16.456 --> 01:58:18.191
THAT'S WHY I'LL BE SUPPORTING

01:58:18.257 --> 01:58:19.192
THE BILL THANK YOU. AND SENATOR

01:58:19.258 --> 01:58:21.227
JUST I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE BUT

01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:23.095
THE AUTHOR DID. JUST SAY ON THE

01:58:23.162 --> 01:58:24.864
ON THE ON THE DIETS THAT TIME

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:26.766
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A WHITE

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.267
OKAY PART OF THE FRAMEWORK. OF

THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. A FIRST

02:04:32.531 --> 02:04:34.633
OF ALL WE HAD KNOWLEDGE THAT

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:36.468
CALIFORNIA'S WIDESPREAD USE OF

FOR. AND THE FACT ON THE GROUND

02:04:51.217 --> 02:04:53.586
IS THAT THE BOTTLE BILL IS THE

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:55.421

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:57.323

02:12:50.829 --> 02:12:51.997
PRODUCERS I KNOW THAT IN MY

02:12:52.064 --> 02:12:53.932
DISTRICT THE SMALLER PRODUCERS-

02:12:53.999 --> 02:12:55.233
YOUR BEHIND THIS WE ALREADY

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:56.201
HEARD ABOUT THE NAPA VALLEY

02:12:56.268 --> 02:12:58.337
VINTNERS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF-

02:12:58.403 --> 02:13:00.038
VIDEO GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE

02:13:00.105 --> 02:13:01.873
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH

02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:03.809
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION A CENTER

02:13:03.875 --> 02:13:06.878
DOLLY- WHAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT

02:13:06.945 --> 02:13:08.680
TO SAY YOU KNOW WE'VE TALKED TO.

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.082
MEMBERS OF EVERY SIZE WITH AN

02:13:10.148 --> 02:13:12.684
ORGANIZATION AND WE HAVE ALMOST

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.853
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT- OUR MEMBERS

02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.521
REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:19.091
RECYCLING- PROGRAMS- THAT BEING

02:13:19.157 --> 02:13:20.625
SAID SOME OF THE FEATURES OF

02:13:20.692 --> 02:13:22.060
BEING A SMALL WINERY ARE ARE

02:13:22.127 --> 02:13:23.195
UNIQUE YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO

02:13:23.261 --> 02:13:25.497
HAVE TO. ALLOW ADEQUATE TIME FOR

SMALLER BUSINESSES TO COME UP TO

02:13:26.865 --> 02:13:28.533
SPEED WITH THIS I THINK THERE

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:30.769
IS- YOU KNOW BRINGING IN WINE IS

02:13:30.836 --> 02:13:32.037
A LOT DIFFERENT THAN BRINGING

02:13:32.104 --> 02:13:34.072
IN- OTHER PRODUCTS WHERE THERE

02:13:34.139 --> 02:13:36.108
MAY BE ONLY FOUR OR FIVE

02:13:36.174 --> 02:13:36.708
DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS BRING

02:13:36.775 --> 02:13:38.176
PRODUCTS AND- SO IMPLEMENTATION

02:13:38.243 --> 02:13:40.512
DATE WHICH IS ALREADY- SOMETHING

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:41.446
THAT'S MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.415
IS IMPORTANT- ONE THING WE

02:13:43.482 --> 02:13:45.884
MENTIONED IN THE LETTER WE

02:13:45.951 --> 02:13:48.286
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE- WINERIES.

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:49.421
COULD BE CONSIDERED A DEALER AND

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:52.324
HAVE TO TAKE BACK PRODUCT WE

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:53.925
DON'T WANT THAT. FOR EXAMPLE

02:13:53.992 --> 02:13:56.161
AND- AND- AS I MENTIONED I

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:58.163
EXPECT WE'RE GOING TO COME

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.498
ACROSS A FEW OF THESE- AS WE

02:13:59.564 --> 02:14:01.900
MOVE THROUGH. I THINK WE HAVE A

02:14:01.967 --> 02:14:02.801
STRONG COMMITMENT FROM THE

02:14:02.868 --> 02:14:03.902
AUTHOR AND SENATOR DOT THAT

02:14:03.969 --> 02:14:05.070
WE'RE GONNA WORK THROUGH THIS

02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:13.545
WHEN I WAS THAT IN. IN OTHER

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:14.713
RECYCLING PROGRAMS WHERE THEY BE

THEY ARE HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK

02:14:16.181 --> 02:14:18.083

ISSUE CAME UP BEFORE. AND THEN

02:14:23.722 --> 02:14:24.322

ART IS A- TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT

03:00:24.713 --> 03:00:27.383
TARGET. AND WHILE THAT MAY SEEM

03:00:27.449 --> 03:00:29.885
VERY. YOU KNOW. IT'S LIKE

03:00:29.952 --> 03:00:32.021

AS COMPARED TO EVEN TWO YEARS

03:00:39.995 --> 03:00:43.032

03:00:47.036 --> 03:00:49.305
EVERY. VEHICLE MANUFACTURER IS

NOW PUTTING OUT MODELS OF ZERO

03:00:52.441 --> 03:00:54.777
EMISSION VEHICLES. SO I. I THINK

03:00:54.843 --> 03:00:59.348
THAT IT'S- NOT- ON. AND

03:00:59.415 --> 03:01:02.151

03:01:13.195 --> 03:01:15.364
CLEARLY A RB HAS THE ABILITY TO

03:01:15.431 --> 03:01:18.033
MODIFY IF WE FIND THAT AT THAT

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:21.303
POINT WE'RE NOT. BUT THIS IS YOU

03:01:21.370 --> 03:01:23.239
KNOW COULD BE A STRETCH GOAL BUT

03:01:23.305 --> 03:01:23.906
WE'RE BASICALLY THE STATUS

03:01:23.973 --> 03:01:26.442

BUT AT IN THE DAY CALIFORNIANS.

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:52.568

03:01:59.608 --> 03:02:01.510
ABOUT A LOT OF CALIFORNIA THAT.

03:02:01.577 --> 03:02:03.512
THAT CALIFORNIANS RELY ON TO

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:05.481
TAKE CARE THEIR PUBLIC SERVICES

03:02:05.547 --> 03:02:08.250
AND IN FOR EXAMPLE. THE SNOW

03:02:08.317 --> 03:02:11.487
PLOWS AND TRUCKS AND HEAVY DUTY

03:02:11.553 --> 03:02:13.155
EQUIPMENT THAT WE USE EVERY DAY

03:02:13.222 --> 03:02:14.923
IN CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE THE

03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:16.358
SERVICES THAT WE NEED AND I

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:17.092
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE

03:02:17.159 --> 03:02:19.194
INFRASTRUCTURE. IS GOING TO BE

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:21.764
IN PLACE AND I KNOW THAT YOU

03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:22.631
KNOW THE YEAH WE'RE MOVING

03:02:22.698 --> 03:02:25.167
FASTLY TO- YOU KNOW ELECTRICAL

03:02:25.234 --> 03:02:26.235
VEHICLES BUT WHEN YOU START

03:02:26.302 --> 03:02:28.904
GETTING TO THE HEAVY DUTY I MEAN

03:02:28.971 --> 03:02:30.072
WE TO AND WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION

03:02:30.139 --> 03:02:31.907
TRANSPORTATION- ABOUT THE PORTS.

03:02:31.974 --> 03:02:35.644
AND ABOUT. DRIED STRIKES IN AND

03:02:35.711 --> 03:02:37.546
THEY HAVE A STRUCTURE THERE AS

03:02:37.613 --> 03:02:38.814
WELL AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE OUT

03:02:38.881 --> 03:02:40.749
IN THIS IS A LARGE STAT. WHEN

03:02:40.816 --> 03:02:41.950
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING

03:02:42.017 --> 03:02:43.352
INFRASTRUCTURE IN ALPINE COUNTY

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:45.421
WHICH I REPRESENT TO HAVE AN

03:02:45.487 --> 03:02:47.056
ELECTRIC VEHICLE THERE IS THERE

03:02:47.122 --> 03:02:49.091
THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOME. I

03:02:49.158 --> 03:02:50.426
DON'T BELIEVE IT'LL WORK I DON'T

03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:52.594
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE

03:02:52.661 --> 03:02:53.195
INFRASTRUCTURE TO CHARGE THESE

03:02:53.262 --> 03:02:55.798
VEHICLES TO OR IF IT'S HYDROGEN

03:02:55.864 --> 03:02:57.032
WILL HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR

03:02:57.099 --> 03:02:58.500
THAT SO I'M LOOKING AT WHAT

03:02:58.567 --> 03:03:00.169
TECHNOLOGY GOING TO WORK IN

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:02.604
ALPINE COUNTY OR- OR- TO. WHERE

03:03:02.671 --> 03:03:06.008

OF SNOW SOMETIMES AND THE BILL

03:03:08.277 --> 03:03:09.978
THE BILL TO KEEP PEOPLE MOVING I

03:03:10.045 --> 03:03:14.416
THINK THIS IS A VERY- RISKIER.

03:03:14.483 --> 03:03:16.051
ABOUT I WAS DOESN'T DIRECTOR FOR

03:03:16.118 --> 03:03:18.053

03:03:18.120 --> 03:03:19.588
SPONDON THAT THIS IS PER

03:03:19.655 --> 03:03:21.590
PURCHASE RIGHT BY THE STATE'S

03:03:21.657 --> 03:03:24.993
AND- WE DON'T THE STATE DOESN'T

03:03:25.060 --> 03:03:26.729
REPLACE VEHICLES ON AN ANNUAL

03:03:26.795 --> 03:03:28.931
ALL VEHICLES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

03:03:28.997 --> 03:03:30.499
THERE ARE LONGER TERM SO IT

03:03:30.566 --> 03:03:32.401
DOESN'T REQUIRE ALL. OF THAT

03:03:32.468 --> 03:03:35.371
EQUIPMENT TO BE ON TO BE SEVENTH

03:03:35.437 --> 03:03:37.506

THAT THERE'S NOT AN AVAILABLE

03:03:44.913 --> 03:03:46.548

03:03:46.615 --> 03:03:47.383
ACHIEVED THOSE AVAILABLE

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:52.855

PROUD CO SPONSORS OF SB TWELVE

03:06:09.024 --> 03:06:10.893
THIRTY. FIRST I WANT TO THANK

03:06:10.959 --> 03:06:12.094
SENATOR LIMON FOR AUTHORING THIS

03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.829
BILL IN THE MEMBERS OF THIS

03:06:13.896 --> 03:06:14.930
COMMITTEE FOR YOUR HARD

03:06:14.997 --> 03:06:16.632
THOUGHTFUL WORK. TO PROTECT OUR

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:17.266
SHARED ENVIRONMENT. IS YOU KNOW

03:06:17.332 --> 03:06:18.834
EMISSIONS FROM CARS AND TRUCKS

03:06:18.901 --> 03:06:20.269
HAVE LONG BEEN A THORN IN

03:06:20.335 --> 03:06:21.537
CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS TO ATTAIN

03:06:21.603 --> 03:06:22.704
SAFE. HEALTHY AIR QUALITY FOR

03:06:22.771 --> 03:06:24.139
THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE

03:06:24.206 --> 03:06:25.440
CONDUCTED OUTREACH AND EDUCATION

03:06:25.507 --> 03:06:26.575
AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

03:06:26.642 --> 03:06:27.809
COMMUNITIES. TO HELP THEM GET

03:06:27.876 --> 03:06:30.012
INTO CLEAN CARS DOING THIS WORK

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:31.213
WE LEARN THAT WHAT CALIFORNIA

03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:32.814
HAS STRONG PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT%

03:06:32.881 --> 03:06:34.216
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AND

03:06:34.283 --> 03:06:35.918
THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE DONE A LOT

03:06:35.984 --> 03:06:37.019
OF GOOD WORK. UNFORTUNATELY THE

03:06:37.085 --> 03:06:38.353
INCENTIVE LANDSCAPE IS DIFFICULT

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.756
TO NAVIGATE. THERE ARE PROGRAMS

03:06:40.822 --> 03:06:42.024
EACH WITH ITS OWN APPLICATION

03:06:42.090 --> 03:06:43.358
AND ITS OWN TIMING FOR APPROVAL

03:06:43.425 --> 03:06:45.027
IN USE. IN PRACTICE THESE

03:06:45.093 --> 03:06:46.228
PROGRAMS DON'T MEET THE NEEDS OF

03:06:46.295 --> 03:06:47.362
LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

03:06:47.429 --> 03:06:49.231
RESIDENTS. WHO EIGHT DON'T HAVE

03:06:49.298 --> 03:06:51.099
THE EXPENDABLE INCOME TO BE ABLE

03:06:51.166 --> 03:06:52.901
TO BUY NOW AND RECEIVE A REBATE

03:06:52.968 --> 03:06:54.836
LATER. AND TO BE WHO TEND TO

03:06:54.903 --> 03:06:55.404
DRIVE THEIR CURRENT VEHICLE

03:06:55.470 --> 03:06:58.307
UNTIL IT BREAKS DOWN. WHICH

03:06:58.373 --> 03:06:59.074
MEANS WAITING PERIODS ARE

03:06:59.141 --> 03:07:00.342
PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WHEN THEY

03:07:00.409 --> 03:07:01.443
NEED IT. THAT NEED IS URGENT. BY

03:07:01.510 --> 03:07:02.844
SIMPLIFYING AND STREAMLINING THE

03:07:02.911 --> 03:07:04.012
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVES

03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:05.781
UNDER A ONE STOP SHOP. AND

03:07:05.847 --> 03:07:06.848
MAKING FUNDS AVAILABLE AT POINT

03:07:06.915 --> 03:07:08.850
OF SALE. SB TWELVE THIRTY AIMS

03:07:08.917 --> 03:07:10.018
TO ENSURE THESE PROGRAMS BETTER

03:07:10.085 --> 03:07:11.887
SERVE THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST.

03:07:11.954 --> 03:07:13.255
ADDITIONALLY WE FOUND A LACK OF

03:07:13.322 --> 03:07:14.990
ACCESS TO PUBLIC CHARGERS. IN

03:07:15.057 --> 03:07:16.158
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

03:07:16.224 --> 03:07:17.426
CREATES AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO

03:07:17.492 --> 03:07:19.227
ADOPTION. INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD

03:07:19.294 --> 03:07:21.396
OUT LAGS BEHIND DEMAND. IN THIS

03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:22.998
DYNAMIC NEEDS TO BE FLIPPED. THE

03:07:23.065 --> 03:07:24.533
SECOND PART OF SB TWELVE THIRTY

03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:26.134
ALTHOUGH. AND LANGUAGE. COOLEY

03:07:26.201 --> 03:07:27.369
AIMS TO ACCELERATE THE BUILD OUT

03:07:27.436 --> 03:07:29.004
OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND

03:07:29.071 --> 03:07:30.172
ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT IS

03:07:30.238 --> 03:07:32.374
EQUITABLE. AND SUSTAINABLE IN

03:07:32.441 --> 03:07:33.709
CONCLUSION SB TWELVE THIRTY CAN

03:07:33.775 --> 03:07:35.344
HELP ENSURE. THAT AS WE PURSUE

03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:37.179
OUR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE GOALS.

03:07:37.245 --> 03:07:38.647

03:15:06.394 --> 03:15:07.829
COMMUNITIES HAVE CLEAN AIR AND-

03:15:07.896 --> 03:15:09.597
WEALTHIER PEOPLE AND WE SAW

03:15:09.664 --> 03:15:12.767
COMMUNITIES LIKE FRESNO AND- AND

03:15:12.834 --> 03:15:14.069

03:15:14.135 --> 03:15:16.438
IMPAIRED NOT GETTING THIS IS A

03:15:16.504 --> 03:15:18.139

STREAMLINED ACROSS THIS IS WHAT

03:15:19.808 --> 03:15:21.376
THIS BILL IS REALLY DO IS

OTHER PIECE THAT IS PART OF THIS

03:15:25.880 --> 03:15:27.248
IS THAT THERE ARE STATE PRO.

THERE'S ALSO THE STRICT PROGRAM

03:15:29.451 --> 03:15:30.819
AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY

03:15:30.885 --> 03:15:32.454
COMBINED THE INFORMATION SO THAT

03:15:32.520 --> 03:15:34.989

ONE PLACE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:15:38.693 --> 03:15:40.128
ARE ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY

03:15:40.195 --> 03:15:41.796
COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY FOR

03:15:41.863 --> 03:15:43.031
BOTH STATEWIDE AND LOCAL BUT

03:15:43.098 --> 03:15:45.934
THIS IS. A PROGRAM IN ANY DEAL A

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.002
TICKET EXPAND STATEWIDE- IT

03:15:48.069 --> 03:15:49.804
THROUGH KIND OF CONDENSING AND

03:15:49.871 --> 03:15:53.241
STREAMLINING THE INFORMATION THE

03:15:53.308 --> 03:15:54.175
PROGRAM ITSELF IT'S NOT DOING.

03:15:54.242 --> 03:15:56.077
AS MANY CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM

03:15:56.144 --> 03:15:59.781
ITSELF. SO IT'S A WHITE I WAS

03:15:59.848 --> 03:16:00.915
ONE MAKE SURE UNDERSTANDS

03:16:00.982 --> 03:16:03.852
BECAUSE IS NOT PRIORITIZING. THE

03:16:03.918 --> 03:16:05.286

EVERYBODY THIS BILL RIGHT BUT

03:16:10.058 --> 03:16:11.759
THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:16:11.826 --> 03:16:13.528
MAKING SURE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE

03:16:13.595 --> 03:16:14.896
THAT YOU BROUGHT UP HOW DO WE

03:16:14.963 --> 03:16:16.531

WHO ARE NOT APPLYING FOR THIS

03:16:17.866 --> 03:16:19.501
AND SO I THINK THAT'S A PROBABLY

03:16:19.567 --> 03:16:21.636
MORE COMPLICATED CONVERSATION-

03:16:21.703 --> 03:16:23.404
