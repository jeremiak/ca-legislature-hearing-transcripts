AS CHAIR MY POLICY HAS BEEN TO PROCURE EVERY BILL ABSENT OF EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OBVIOUSLY IT COVE IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING. MOST OF THE BILLS WE HEAR COMMITTEE DIRECTLY IMPACT THE STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES AND IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO CHART A PRUDENT COURSE WELL CALIFORNIA CASES THE TWIN CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S ECONOMIC FALLOUT. PUT SIMPLY ANY BILL THAT REDUCES GENERAL FUND REVENUE WAS THOROUGHLY SCRUTINIZED AND MOST WERE NOT SET FOR HEARING. THIS WAS DECISION WAS NOT MADE LIGHTLY IT WAS MADE TO REFLECT THE REALITY WE CURRENT FIND OURSELVES IN. IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A QUORUM. MR ROUGHLY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. BURKE HERE BURKE HERE BRO. BRO HERE TO. CHIU HERE GREAT LEVINE MAYES MULLIN PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS HERE GLORIA THREE OF US I WAS HERE VOEPEL. VOEPEL HERE MADAM CHAIR YOU HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU- AND BEFORE WE CAR FIRST WHEN AS A DO YOU WANT TO SAY WE'RE SORRY AGAIN I WANT TO SAY WE'RE SORRY THE DOCTOR QUIRK WAS NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING TODAY WE HAVE EXTENDED HIM THE OFFER OF PROVIDE. ANY SORT OF TESTIMONY OR ANY SORT OF QUESTIONS THAT HE HAS ON BILLS TO IN ADVANCE- BECAUSE HIS INPUT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN VERY VALUED IN COMMITTEE SO. WITH THAT LET'S START WITH FILE ITEM ONE AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE DOCTOR RANDY LOW YOUR FREEDOM OPEN WHEN YOU ARE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ON AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE REGARDING COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKS COMMUNITY BLOOD BANKING IS ONE OF THE BEHIND THE SCENES PILLARS OF FIRST RESPONSE YET IN CALIFORNIA IN STATE BLOOD DONOR TESTING FOR LABORATORY ASSETS HAVE CLIMBED OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE THAT IMPOSES STATE SALES TAX ON BLOOD DONOR TESTING REAGENTS EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES. ONLY TWO DONOR TESTING LABORATORIES REMAIN OPERATIONAL IN THE STATE THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER WHICH IS AN FRESNO IN THE STANFORD BLOOD CENTER IN PALO ALTO. ALL OTHER BLOOD BANKS NOW SEND THEIR SAMPLES TO OUT OF STATE LABORATORIES FOR TESTING PARTLY DUE TO THE INCREASE OF IN STATE COSTS WITH SALES TAX. THE REDUCED NUMBER OF BLOOD TESTING FACILITIES WITHIN THE STATE RAISES PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS AND PRESENTS A CRISIS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR HOMELAND SECURITY OR MASS CASUALTY OF AND- AS WE NOW KNOW ALL TOO WELL. BLOOD BANK ACROSS THE STATE ARE EXPERIENCING CRITICAL NEEDS DURING THE COVE AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. MORE THAN FLICK FIFTY BLOOD DRIVES HAVE BEEN CANCELED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LEADING TO A SEVERE SHORTAGE AND BLOOD. THE LACK OF ADEQUATE FACILITIES TO SCREEN BLOOD DONATIONS MAKES THE PUBLIC VULNERABLE TO THE BLOOD PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. WITH THE ONLY TWO DONOR TESTING LABS FUNCTIONING IN THE STATE THERE IS A SERIOUS CONCERN FOR DELAYED ACCESS TO NEEDED BLOOD SUPPLIES FOR TRANSFUSIONS AND TRANSFERRING BLOOD SUPPLIES ACROSS STATE LINES. AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE EXEMPTS SALES AND USE TAX ON LABORATORY EQUIPMENT AND CHEMICAL REAGENTS USED BY A LICENSED BLOOD BANK TO TEST VOLUNTARILY DONATED HUMAN BLOOD. THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXEMPT EQUIPMENT CHEMICALS AND REAGENTS AND QUALITY CONTROL AND MATERIALS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO PERFORM FTA AND CALIFORNIA MANDATED SCREENING TESTS. TO ASSURE THE SAFETY OF VOLUNTARILY BLOOD PLATELETS AND PLASMA DONATIONS FOR TRANSFUSION. THE EXEMPTIONS WILL PROVIDE VITAL COST RELIEF TO THE REMAINING TWO CENTERS THAT PERFORM IN STATE DONOR TESTING ON BLOOD DONATIONS HELPING THESE LABS TO REMAIN VIABLE. THIS EXEMPTION MAY ALSO ENCOURAGE OTHER CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTERS TO RESUME BLOOD DONOR TESTING IN OUR STATE. BLOOD CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA THAT COLLECT BLOOD FOR TRANSFUSIONS ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS ANY COST RELIEF FROM THE EXEMPTION WOULD BENEFIT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WOULD HELP TO CONTAIN COSTS. HERE TO TESTIFY ON THE PHONE IN SUPPORT THIS CHRISTOPHER STOP WITH THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER AS WELL AS HER PRETE SEND DO WITH THE STANFORD BLOOD CENTER. THE WE HAVE A MOTION BY A BRO A SECOND BY PETRIE-NORRIS. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES I WOULD ASK A MODERATOR TO CONNECT THIS FIRST WITH MR STOP. STOP YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER STOP ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER IN FRESNO AND I SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE. CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER HAS MAINTAINED AN UPGRADED ITS HIGH COMPLEXITY BLOOD DONOR TESTING LABORATORY THROUGH SIX DECADES SERVING THE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITIES ON BLOOD CENTERS AROUND THE STATE AND NATION. WE EMPLOY ABOUT EIGHT LABORATORY SCIENCES AS WELL IT'S ABOUT TWELVE LABORATORY TECHNICIAN. HAVING OUR LAB IN HOUSE HELPS US MAINTAIN RAPID ACCESS TO DONATED BLOOD MARCH FOR OUR HOSPITALS HAVING OUR LABORATORY HAS ENABLED US TO RESPOND RAPIDLY WELL THE FDA REQUESTED THAT WE PRODUCE PROBATE NINETEEN CONVALESCENT PLASMA. AND WE BECAME THE FIRST BLOOD CENTER IN THE NATION THE PRODUCE PATHOGEN INACTIVATED WHOLE BIT CONVALESCENT PLASMA TO BRING HOPE TO PATIENTS WITH COPD AT NINETEEN THE PANDEMIC HAS STRAPS THE BOTTOM LINE OF A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. I'D LIKE TO COMMENT. S. IS RATED WHETHER THE- EXAM SUPPLIES EQUIPMENT AND REAGENTS COULD BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WHETHER THE SCOPE OF THE EXTENSIONS COULD BE INADVERTENTLY TO BROUGHT THE ANSWER IS NO THE FDA REGULATIONS ON BLOOD DONOR SCREENING ARE VERY SPECIFIC REGION EQUIPMENT USED FOR SCREENING BLOOD DONATIONS ARE SPECIFICALLY LICENSED BY THE FDA SOLELY FOR THIS PURPOSE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE NARROW SCOPE OF THE ITEMS BEING EXEMPTED BECAUSE WHEN. IF UNDERSTOOD IT EXPLAIN GUIDE TO LEAVE THE DISPARITY BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES OF REVENUE LOSS TO THE STATE OF BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR. AND A HIGHER LAUNCH TO SUGGESTED BY THE COMMITTEE ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BY EXEMPTING THESE VERY SPECIFIC ITEMS FROM SALES AND USE TAX IN CALIFORNIA. JUST OF THE OTHER BLOOD DONOR TESTING LAMPS APTED DID MANAGE IN OTHER STATES OF OUR NATION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU.

OUR DONOR TESTING LABORATORY OPERATION ALLOWS US TO KEEP JOBS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR BOTH LICENSE FLAP PROFESSIONAL AS WELL AS ON THAT YOUR JOB TRAINED EMPLOYEES WHO SUPPORT LAB OPERATION. OUR DONOR TESTING LABORATORY OPERATIONS ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE THE FDA MANDATED TESTING DAY IN AND DAY OUT. TO ENSURE TIMELY AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF LIFESAVING BLOOD PRODUCTS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY WITHOUT HAVING TO FACE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUTSOURCING THIS TESTING. INCLUDING INCLEMENT WEATHER LOFT SAMPLE AIRLINE DELAYS WHICH AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE LIFESAVING BLOOD PRODUCT. IN ADDITION TO PORTING THE ROUTINE OPERATION DURING TIMES OF VERY DIFFICULT HEALTH CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE AIDS EPIDEMIC AND THE CURRENT CO THE NINETEEN GLOBAL ABBOTT PANDEMIC. OUR LAB ALLOWS US TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND TO THE SCIENTIFIC DATA AND EARNINGS BY PREVENTING LOWER TO RELEVANT CASTING BECAUSE WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL TO DO SO. FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY BLOOD CENTER IN NORTH AMERICA TO PERFORM HARD COLD BEACH NEW QUAKE AFTER. UNTIL BUT THE STAMP ONE TENER AND THE TEN CAL BY CENTER. DONOR TESTING LAB OUR STATE HAS THE ABILITY TO TAP AND WILL BE ONE PRODUCT IN THE TIMES OF DISASTER YOU THAT. SUCH AS SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN GROUND AND AIR TRAVEL WAS EXTREMELY LET DISTRICT AT. WHILE OUR OUR LABS ARE NOT BUILT FOR LARGE VOLUME. OKAY HANDLE THE TESTING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN THESE TIMES TO ALLOW THE MOST CRITICAL BLOOD PRODUCT TO BE TESTED LEAST. FOR THE MOST CRITICAL PATIENTS TO ENSURE THERE IS NOT COMPROMISED. AFTER THE AFTER ANNUAL FOR STANFORD CENTER ARE. TWO AND FIFTY DOLLAR AND- IF THIS EXEMPTION MAY BE A CREDIT AND THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE ESTIMATED SAVINGS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTER. SO TOTAL IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO THE STATE. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE SOME PARITY WITH THE TESTING LAB IN OTHER STATES. AS WELL AS OTHER CALIFORNIA BLOOD CENTERS WHO NOW SEND THEIR TESTING OUT OF STATE AND ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE EXTENT. WITH THE HELP OF THIS EXEMPTION DESCRIBED IN THE FELT CAMPER BLOOD CENTER INTENDS TO KEEP OUR DONOR TESTING LAB AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OPERATION. FOR THE GOOD OF OUR PATIENTS OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A LARGE. TO PROVIDE THIS CRITICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICE IN THE EVENT AN UNPLANNED DISASTER AND- MAP CASUALTY AMOUNT.

EXACTLY INCLUDING EXAM FACTOR THAT. ARE INTENDED CHEN TO INVENTED KEEP THAT WOULD NOT. OCCUR GIVEN THE A NOR MODE. OF BLOOD BANG TO PUT A PER. DUE DILIGENCE AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF THE FAILURE TO DO SO. WE BELIEVE IT'S UNLIKELY THAT TWENTY NINE EIGHTY NINE WILL RESULT IN ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD NOT OTHERWISE ALREADY OCCUR BUT IN FACT ARE ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. THE REALITY IS THAT BLOOD CENTERS ARE ALREADY RESPONSIBLE FOR PERFORMING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE TESTS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS THE CLIFF HIV AND EVEN MORE RECENTLY WEST NILE AND BEAKER VIRUS WHICH WERE ADDED TO THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT. AS A FINAL NOTE THE PROPONENT DID MENTION AND THEIR TESTIMONY THAT THEY BELIEVE THERE IS A DISPARITY BETWEEN THE BLOOD BANK ESTIMATED COSTS AND THE POTENTIAL REVENUE IMPACT PROVIDED BY THE STATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT RELIEF IS TRULY NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THEM OF CALIFORNIA'S LET BANKS AND MEETING THE ADDITIONAL TESTING DEMAND. THE TYPICALLY DO TO COPE AT NINETEEN THE AUTHOR MIGHT.
