I USE IT WISELY. AND THERE'S NO NEED TO FEEL YOU NEED TO USE A MALL. TO WE WILL BE ABLE. TO TELL [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] GEN YEAH [inaudible] UHHUH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] HELLO. UNDER THE ONE CONCERN. PROVIDED THE THINGS ON THE PROGRAM UP MISTER MULLIN WE'RE STARTING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THAT BE OKAY WITH YOU. AND WE DID LAID OUT SOME GROUND RULES -- THREE WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. I NEED SIDE. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS. PRESENTING A. B.. ELEVEN SIXTY EIGHT ON TEXT TO NINE ONE ONE AB ELEVEN SIXTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT A TEXT THE NINE ONE ONE SERVICE. TO ALL COUNTIES BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS BILL WOULD BENEFIT THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY. BY PROVIDING EQUAL ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO T. T. Y. OR VIDEO RELAY SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA TT WHY IS IT VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE THE WAYS OF COMMUNICATING WITH EMERGENCY DISPATCHERS. WHEN IN NEED OF HELP FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY? VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH A THIRD PARTY IT ALLOWS THE INTERPRETER TO SEE THE CALLER. BUT THE ACCESS TO NINE ONE ONE IS SOMETIMES DELAYED DUE TO TRANSLATION VERSUS A DIRECT TEXT MESSAGE. AS NEW TECHNOLOGY KEEPS ADVANCING T. T. Y. AND VIDEO RELAY SERVICES ARE NOT THE MOST ACCESSIBLE FORM OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN THE DEAF OR HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY. JUST LIKE PEOPLE IN GENERAL THEY ARE RELYING ON INSTANT MESSAGING TEXT MESSAGING EMAIL OR VIDEO COMMUNICATION THROUGH SMART PHONES OR COMPUTERS. MY HOME COUNTY OF SAN MATTEO AND SACRAMENTO ARE AMONG THE COUNTIES OUT OF IMPLEMENTED TAX TO NINE ONE ONE TECHNOLOGY. ALLOWING ITS CITIZENS TO REACH AN EMERGENCY DISPATCH WHEN IT'S UNSAFE FOR ON FEASIBLE TO CALL. THIS TECHNOLOGY WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN SITUATIONS WHERE IT MIGHT BE TOO DANGEROUS TO DIAL. DOMESTIC ABUSE INCIDENTS. ACCIDENTS THAT CAUSE IN ABILITY TO SPEAK. OR EVEN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATIONS. WITH ME TODAY IS SHERRY FARIDA. CEO OF NOR CAL SERVICES FOR DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. YEAH. AND I AM THERE HE OF NOR CAL CENTER ON DEAFNESS. AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT'S NEEDED. AND REALLY I WANT TO START WITH A PERSONAL STORY TO EMPHASIZE THIS MY SON FELL AND HURT HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS JUMPING ON THE BED. AND ENDED UP HITTING HIS HEAD ON THE WINDOW SILL. HE WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY AND I WAS TRYING TO GRAB A TOWEL AND HOLD IT TO HIS BLEEDING HEAD WHILE AT THE SAME TIME USE A TTY DEVICE TO CALL. TIMES BAY HUNG UP ON ME. AND I FINALLY HAD TO GIVE UP GRAB MY SON AND RUSHED HIM OFF TO THE HOSPITAL ON MY OWN. AND IT WAS SIX HOURS LATER WHEN WE WERE BACK AT HOME THEN L. A. P. D. SHOWED UP -- WITH A BUSINESS CARD AND LEFT IT AT OUR DOOR. AND SAID THAT THEY HAD STOPPED BY DUE TO MY CALL SO OF COURSE I FILED A COMPLAINT WITH THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. AND AT THAT TIME. I'M THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THERE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Y. AS JANET RENO. SO. SHE TOOK MY CASE. AN ORDERED THAT -- WE HAD TO HAD MAJOR CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES COMPLIANCE WITH NINE ONE ONE RULES. SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE DEAF COMMUNITY HAS REALLY NOT ANY CONFIDENCE. IN WHAT IS BEING ABLE TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. AND THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESSIBLE SERVICES -- THROUGH THE FCC JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. I'VE BEEN ADVISED ME TO PAUSE FOR JUST ONE SECOND [inaudible] BUT THERE PLEASE CONTINUE IN THANK YOU SURE [inaudible] WE NEED. SO WITH BIG. THE EMERGENCY ACCESS ADVISORY COMMITTEE IN TWENTY TWELVE RECOMMENDED THAT WE HAVE TEXT TO NINE ONE ONE AND THAT NEEDED TO BE I'M ON HOLD AND TELL WEEK COULD HAVE HAPPENED OTHER MEETING ABOUT. NINE ONE ONE BUT I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE WISDOM WE NEED DIRECT SERVICES. TO NINE ONE ONE SO EVER SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING AND WAITING AND WE'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH IT'S TIME NOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE. THE MEANS ARE THERE AND SO I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TIME NOW IT THERE'S ALREADY A FEW COUNTIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY HAVE TEXT TO NINE ONE ONE SO THERE'S NO EXCUSE. THAT THE ENTIRE STATE DOESN'T DEMAND THAT WE HAVE IT THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE IT THROUGH ALL THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES -- IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN MEANS A LOT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT WITNESSES YEAH. SEE NO MAN AND DIGITAL SUPPORT WITNESSES [inaudible] ADDITIONAL. FIVE HELLO MY NAME IS FRANCIS DETERMINE AND I'M ADVOCATE SERVICES FOR TO KERA AND DEATH COUNSELLING AND REFERRAL AGENCY. AND I HAVE A PERSONAL STORY AS WELL AS A DEAF PERSON -- I WAS IN AN ABUSIVE MARRIAGE AND MY EX HUSBAND. OF PREVENTING ME FROM LEAVING THE HOUSE. HE DISABLED THE CAR THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND ME I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A VIOLENT SITUATION HOW WAS I ABLE TO GET OUT I COULDN'T CALL FOR HELP. AND NOBODY WAS THERE IF I HAD A PHONE TO TEXT TO NINE ONE ONE I WOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO HELP AND I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THAT IMMEDIATE THAT DANGEROUS VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION. AND I'M THINKING OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS A MOTHER -- I MY DAUGHTER IT WAS THREE AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SHE HAD -- SHE WASN'T ABLE TO PLEASE BREED SHE WAS CRYING AND I HAD TO GO THROUGH THE VIDEO RELAY SERVICE CALL 911- BUT BECAUSE I WAS USING MY LAPTOP. I WAS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED AND SO -- I HAD TO CALL UBER AND I HAD TO GO THE HOSPITAL ON MY OWN AND I COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN PRESENT PREVENTED HAD I HAD NINE ONE ONE ACCESS. SO THIS BILL IF PASSED WOULD CERTAINLY HELP A LOT OF DEAF PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AT ALL AROUND CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT WE'RE ALLOWING THREE PEOPLE AT TWO MINUTES SO ONE MORE PERSON GETS. A TWO MINUTE AFTER THAT IT'S ONLY NAME ORGANIZATION A SUPPORTER OPPOSE PERIOD THANK YOU [inaudible] HELLO.

SO AGAIN NOT EVERYONE HAS INTERNET ACCESS SO IT. TEXT TO NINE ONE ONE IS IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE AND THEN IT WOULD CERTAINLY SAVE A LOT OF LIVES AND GET US OUT OF A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCES SO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO ME TODAY.

BOB GREAT BILL I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT A DAY I HAD A QUESTION -- I'VE I WAS VERY FAMILIAR WITH SHORT MESSAGE SERVICES BUT NOT VERY FAMILIAR WITH REAL TIME MESSAGING SERVICE. AND I WONDERED WHY YOUR BILL DOESN'T REQUIRE THAT NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS ACCEPTED BOTH RATHER THAN JUST ONE OF THE OTHER. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE REAL TIME MESSAGING SERVICE WOULD BE SOMETHING MUCH MORE USEFUL TO PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SO I DON'T EVEN. SEE ANY REASON WHY ARE NINE ONE ONE DISPATCHER SHOULDN'T BE REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO EITHER ONE OF THEM RATHER THAN JUST ONE OF THE OTHER. WALT THANK YOU WERE SELLING AND I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT AND I WILL MOST CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO EXPAND ACCESS -- ENTIRELY IF WE IF WE GET OPEN THAT UP IT DOESN'T CREATE TOUGH ALL SORTS OF UP -- ISSUES WITH ACTUALLY GETTING THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND MOST CERTAINLY WILL ENTERTAIN THAT I DON'T KNOW WITH -- MY WITNESS HAS ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENT JUST ON THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE SINCE SHE'S BEEN IMMERSED IN THIS. TOPIC. FCC IS RICK IS RECOMMENDING THAT WE INCLUDE. THE ABILITY THAT WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE OF BOTH SO IN CLUB REAL TIME CAPTIONING AND ALSO AS WELL AS TEXT. AS WELL AND SO INTO WE GET TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF NINE ONE ONE THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND SEEN NONE. OF WHICH I'VE CLOSE WAS MULLIN. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT AND JUST WANT TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE. TO THE DEAF AND HARD HARD OF HEARING COMMUNITY WHO HAVE BEEN ACTIVE ON A NUMBER OF BILLS -- THAT WE'VE CARRIED THANK THEM -- FOR MAKING THEIR WAY TO THE CAPITAL AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ADULT. THANK YOU MISTER MULLIN -- THIS BILL WILL BE TAKEN UP A ONCE THERE'S A QUORUM THANK YOU THANK YOU. SEE MR LEVINE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT TO SUBCOMMITTEE. MR LOOK MISTER LIVING YOU WERE HERE EARLIER -- FOR SOME HOUSEKEEPING. WE HAD SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE THREE WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. THANK YOU AND AGAIN YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TODAY I PRESENT AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE WHICH WILL PROHIBIT A MOBILE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER. FROM IMPAIRING OR DEGRADING. A THE LAWFUL INTERNET TRAFFIC OF EMERGENCY -- OF ITS PUBLIC SAFETY CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS DURING A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY WHEN RESPONDING TO DECLARE A STATE OF EMERGENCY PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL MAY UTILIZE THE STATEWIDE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. TO REQUEST ASSISTANCE FROM PUBLIC SAFETY DEPARTMENTS IN NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS. THE EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT OF THE MUTUAL AID SYSTEM REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF COORDINATION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS IN REAL TIME UPDATES THE A SPECIALIZED COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE OFFICIALS COMBAT IN THE MENDOCINO COMPLEX FIRES EXPERIENCE DATA THROTTLING OTHER COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT WITH THIS EQUIPMENT SLOWED TO A CRAWL THEY WERE FORCED TO CON. CONTACT YOUR PROVIDERS CUSTOMER SERVICE DEPARTMENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE THEY WERE MET WITH AN OFFER TO UPGRADE THEIR SERVICE. THERE'S EXISTING PLAN IN ORDER TO LIFT THE RESTRICTIONS AS NOTED BY ANTHONY ABOUT IN THE COUNTY'S FIRE CHIEF THE THROTTLING HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND IMPEDED THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CRISIS RESPONSE AN ESSENTIAL EMERGENCY SERVICES. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL WITH FULLY FUNCTIONING EQUIPMENT. AND WHILE STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY PROVIDERS TO NEGATE REPEAT SITUATION AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE WILL ENSURE THE DATA THROTTLING OF PEP OF PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. IS NEVER REPEATED. HERE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS ERNESTO FALCON LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR LIKE TRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION AND CHIEF JEFF MASTON PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. SHE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OFF. CERTAINLY A GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WHEN WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FIRE EVENTS OR ANY DISASTERS RIGHT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE USE THAT CALIFORNIA MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHICH IS PROBABLY THE MOST ROBUST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD? THE USE OF A TELEPHONE AND INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO OUR JOBS -- AS WE FOUND OUT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY FIRE -- THEY HAD AN ISSUE WITH THROTTLING -- THAT REALLY WAS DETRIMENTAL WHEN WE GO INTO EMERGENCY INCIDENT WE ARE REALLY ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET SITUATIONAL AWARENESS DETERMINING WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE MAPPING LOOKS LIKE -- PITCHERS OF FIRE ACTIVITY OF WHO IS WORKING AND WHAT DIVISION ONE GROUPS ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RADIOS WE ALSO REALLY RELY ON OUR ACTUALLY TELEPHONE SYSTEMS. SO THE BOTTOM LINE PRESSURES WERE VERY SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WE'RE THANKFUL THAT THE AUTHORS BROUGHT IT FORWARD -- THIS IS CRITICAL IN THIS STATE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THAT AND WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. I CHAIR SANTIAGO BY CHERYL WITH OR WITHOUT THE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. MY NAME'S EARNEST ABOUT GOING ON THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL FOR THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION -- THE SUCH A PROBLEM BEFORE STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT THE FCC THE PRO COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION NO LONGER DOES THE JOB IN OVERSEEING THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY. AND UNDER THE RESTORING INNER FREEDOM ORDER. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THEREFORE THE STATE MUST DO MORE TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS PROTECTED ON ISSUES SUCH AS PUBLIC SAFETY. THE OTHER SIGNALED IN ITS LITIGATION OVER OVER ITS DECISION TO ABANDON OVERSIGHT BUT THEY REALLY DO NOT THINK THAT DEREGULATION WOULD CAUSE IMPACTS ON PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S A CLARA COUNTY'S COUNCIL A PARTY TO THAT LITIGATION. REFUTED THIS CLAIM INCORRECTLY CHARACTERIZED THAN APPROACH TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT WHEN THESE ISSUES HAPPENED RATHER THAN GETTING AHEAD IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING THE REGULAR WILL WAIT TILL. ARE DEAD BEFORE ACTING. MAKE NO MISTAKE WHAT HAPPENED IN SANTA CLARA IS THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT THERE HAD NOTHING TO DO OF ENGINEERING AND NOTHING TO DO OF NETWORK HAS CITY HAD NOTHING TO DO OF ANY SORT TECHNICAL RATIONALE. THERE ARE NO GOOD REASONS FOR FIRE DEPARTMENTS BROADBAND SERVICE TO BE THROTTLED DOWN TO ONE TWO HUNDREDTH OF ITS ORIGINAL SPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF EMERGENCY RENDER IT USELESS. AND THEN ASKING THEM FOR MORE MONEY AFTER FOUR WEEKS OF A GO AROUND. SUCH CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN ILLEGAL UNDER THE FCC TWENTY FIFTEEN OPEN IN ORDER AND ITS BAN ON ON JUSTIN ON REGIONAL PRACTICES. I'M NOT SAYING YOUR VERIZON PLOTTED TO DO HARM BUT I AM SAYING THAT THERE IS NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY TODAY WITH THE GOAL OF BALANCING OF THE PROFIT MOTIVE FROM OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS PUBLIC SAFETY. TO GET AHEAD OF THESE PROBLEMS. NOW THERE'S NOTHING CONFUSING ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOTHING VAGUER AMBIGUOUS ABOUT THE TERMS OF AB SIXTY NINETY NINE THEY COME STRAIGHT FROM THE TWENTY FIFTEEN ORDER. AT WHICH HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO VETTING BY NUMBER OF EXPERTS AND I DON'T SEE ANY TECHNICAL REASON WHY THE WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE ABLE TO MEET THE GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION PERFECT VERIZON'S ALREADY COMMITTED ON ITS OWN. AFTER ADMITTING WRONG TO DO SO. SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY HERE EFF URGES AND I'VE ON THIS LEGISLATION AND I LOOK FOR ANSWERING QUESTIONS. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY MAIN OPPOSITION. I APOLOGIZE I IS HE THAT WOULD BE NAME ORGANIZATION POSITIONALLY. YES SANDERS REPRESENTING THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICER REPAIR ADVOCATES AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I TRACY ROSENBERG. I'M FROM MEDIA ALLIANCE AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON REGION ACOSTA WAS TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT -- GOOD AFTERNOON MISS SHARE RUSSELL NOVAK ON BEHALF OF THE FIRE DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU SEEN NO ADDITIONAL WITH THE SUPPORT MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. MR CHEN MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON FOR CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE PHILIPPINES OFFICE -- WE WE THINK THIS CAN BE WORKED OUT -- WANTED -- TO ALSO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT THE INCIDENT THAT -- HAS GIVEN RISE TO THIS WAS THAT YOU IN OUR IT WAS -- RECTIFIED -- WAS NOT INTENTIONAL IT WAS NOT THE AND AND IT ALSO DESPITE WITH ONE OF THE WITNESSES WHO SAID IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH NET NEUTRALITY -- AS THE AT THE ANALYSIS I THINK GAP ADEQUATELY POINTS OUT -- THE BILL WAS AMENDED WE APPRECIATED THE AMENDMENT THAT HAD SOME -- LANGUAGE BUT WHICH WAS VERY TROUBLING AT THE BEGINNING -- UNFORTUNATELY WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME SPECIFICS IN HERE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE EMERGENCY TRIGGER HOW DOES A CARRIER KNOW. WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY -- HOW ARE THEY NOTIFIED WHEN THERE IS AN EMERGENCY -- IF IT'S A VERY LOCALIZED SITUATION -- THAT CREATES COMPLICATIONS -- THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND AND KNOW. WHEN AND WHERE THEIR OBLIGATIONS OF APPLY -- AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH MISTER LEVINE -- TO TO WORK OUT -- I DO THINK IMPAIR INTEGRATE IMPAIR OR DEGRADE DOES HAVE SOME -- HAVE -- HAS SOME AMBIGUITY TO IT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE IMPAIRED TO GREAT THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH. THAT NEUTRALITY AGAIN AS THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT WHICH IS THE IMPAIR DEGREE BECAUSE OF CONTENT THIS HAS TO DO WITH DATA -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE ARE A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED BUT BUT AGAIN WANTED WORK THIS THROUGH AND I THINK THAT THERE IS A I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO RESOLVE THIS UP. ANY ADDIIONAL OF OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WHICH OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF CINNAMON I THINK THIS A GREAT BILL -- BOB HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM I DO HAVE A PART OF THE BILL THOUGH THAT I FOUND A LITTLE PUZZLING THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT. SHED SOME LIGHT ON THEIR TWO SECTIONS THE BILL SECTION TWO IS ACT THE SECTION THAT ACTUALLY. IMPLEMENTS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND SECTION ONE JUST HAS SOME FINDINGS AND THE FIRST STATEMENT IN SECTION ONE IS. THE LEGISLATURE FINDS AND DECLARES THAT THIS ACT IS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE POLICE POWER GRANTED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION AND CANNOT BE PREEMPTED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION. I FOUND THAT VERY PUZZLING BECAUSE IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE COULD DECLARE WHAT COULD AND COULD NOT BE FEDERALLY PREEMPTED BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT AUTHORITY OR THAT ABILITY ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES AND THEY DECIDE WHAT GETS PREEMPTED SO. I WONDERED WHY THAT STATEMENTS IN THERE AND AND BECAUSE IT TO ME IT'S NONSENSICAL. WE CAN WORK WITH LEDGE COUNCIL TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND THAT. OKAY. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT BALK IT DID JUST THAT RAISE MY EYEBROWS WHEN I READ IT BUT I I I THINK MANY OF US ARE OFTEN ENTERTAINED BY THE LANGUAGE THAT WE RECEIVE FROM LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL RIGHT. OKAY WELL -- THANKS AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL -- QUESTIONS FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. QUESTION. A SCENE. NINE THIS WILL BE WHICH I CLOSE. I THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THE COMMITTEE -- TO THE STAKEHOLDERS BOTH OF THOSE -- IN SUPPORT NATURALLY BUT BUT EVEN THOSE WHO -- ARE OPPOSED TO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS POLICY ACTUALLY WORKS THAT WERE ABLE TO KEEP CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY SAFE -- WE KNOW -- THAT WE'RE NOT OUT OF OUR OUR LAST DISASTER THAT THERE BEFORE US WE WANNA MAKE SURE WILL TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES ARE SUB CLASS FOR AN AYE VOTE WHEN THE BILL COMES BEFORE YOU. THE THE MEASURE ENJOYS A DO PASSED -- IT TO COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY BUT WE WILL NOT TAKE UP UNTIL THERE IS A A QUORUM. THANK YOU -- MISTER WOULD LIKE PERCENT. WE STATED EARLIER MISTER WHEN THERE WERE ALLOWING THREE WITNESSES. TWO MINUTES EACH FOR AND AGAINST. THANK YOU -- GOOD AFTERNOON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FIVE TWO THREE TWO THIS AFTERNOON. THIS BILL IS IN RESPONSE TO TROUBLING INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM THAT I'M COVERED THE PRACTICE OF CELL PHONE COMPANIES SELLING SENSITIVE SUBSCRIBER DATA. MOST CONCERNING REAL TIME LOCATION DATA AND THIS IS DIFFERENT THEN THE GPS STATE ON YOUR PHONE THE APPS THAT ARE TRACKING YOU THIS IS CELL. TOWER DATA THEY USE TRIANGULATION. TO FIGURE OUT LOCATION THIS INFORMATION WAS AND PACKAGED AND RESOLD. TO ANYBODY WILLING TO PAY USUALLY BOUNTY HUNTERS AND OTHERS WITH AN INTEREST IN FINDING AND STOCKING INDIVIDUALS IN NEAR REAL TIME. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE SAME INFORMATION. IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH A SEARCH WARRANT. AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROTECTION DUE TO THE HIGHLY SENSITIVE NATURE OF YOUR LOCATION FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS HAVE CLEARLY REQUIRE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES TO PROTECT THIS DATA HAD TO SHARED ONLY WITH SUBSCRIBERS CONSENT. HOWEVER THE ONLY FEDERAL ENFORCER IS THE FCC AND IT'S FAILED TO HOLD TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE. AFTER THIS CONDUCT WAS UNCOVERED LAST SUMMER EVERY MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS CEO COMMITTED TO ENDING THE PRACTICE GET EVEN MORE INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM WAS STILL ABLE TO OBTAIN REAL TIME LOCATION. OF A REPORTERS OWN CELL PHONE THIS IN JANUARY THIS BILL MAHER'S THE RESTRICTIONS ALREADY PRESENT IN FEDERAL LAW UPDATING DECADES OLD CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS THAT WERE ENACTED WHEN LANDLINES WERE THE ONLY FORM OF COMMUNICATION. WITH AB FIVE TWO THREE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD THESE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CEOS TO THEIR WORD AND NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THE FCC DECIDES TO DO ITS JOB. I'M PLEASED TO HAVE WITH ME TODAY -- TERRACE DíAS ANDREAS FROM THE P. UC'S PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE TO SPEAK THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT THIS ADDRESS -- FROM THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICE REPAIR ADVOCATES -- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD STRENGTH AND PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS OF WIRELESS PROVIDERS -- THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE WIRES WIRELESS CARRIERS TO OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS BEFORE THEY SHARE OR SELL THAT CUSTOMERS INFORMATION REAL TIME. LOCATION INFORMATION TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES -- ALTHOUGH WIRELESS CARRIERS CLAIM THAT THEY DO NOT SO CUSTOMERS GEO LOCATION DATA -- RECENT GUEST INVESTIGATIONS -- HAVE SHOWN THAT THAT STATEMENT IS COMPLETELY FALSE. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP PAYING INTO THIS PRACTICE AND STRENGTHEN PRIVACY PROTECTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS WHICH THEY CRIED THEY DESERVE. AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ANY ADDITIONAL -- WITNESSES PORT. THERE'S ANY -- ME TO USE. NAME ORGANIZATION -- VIRGIN ACOSTA RETURN WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. ANY MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE AGAIN -- STEVE CARLSON CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH -- WITH MS OR WHEN AND AND HER STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON SOME CONCERNS THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A MAYBE SOME -- CLARIFICATION ON ON OF SORT OF WHAT HAPPENED. THE INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED TO MIDDLE MAN -- DATA AGGREGATORS FORK LARGELY THE PURPOSE. OF PROVIDING FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE FRAUD PROTECTION AND THOSE THAT INFORMATION -- WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS BEING USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES -- BUT THE COMPANIES -- DECIDED THAT THEY NEEDED TO STOP THAT -- AND THEY HAVE AND MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED AS FAST AS WE WOULD LIKE TO AND AND BUT IT BUT IT HAS -- AND THEY'RE NOT PROVIDING ANY OF THAT. TO TO THE POINT THAT THE INFORMATION ABOUT FOR ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE AND FRAUD IS NO LONGER BEING PROVIDED SO. IF THE INTENT WAS THE WAS THE YOU KNOW WAS A WAS A THAT. WAS A GOOD -- ONE IT BECAUSE THE THIS INFORMATION THAT HELPS PEOPLE BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT THE THE USE OF THAT INFORMATION AND IN WAYS THAT WE HADN'T TO ANTICIPATED BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT -- WE SUPPORT -- WE THINK THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR A CONFUSION WITH -- C. C. P. AGE YOUR LOCATION IS A PART OF THE CALIFORNIA -- CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT AND WHO DOES TO MS IRWIN BECAUSE SHE'S A SHE'S A WARRIOR ON THAT DONE ON A ON A LOT OF FRONTS AND SO -- YOU SEE CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE THINK THAT TO SOME ISSUES THERE THAT WE'D LIKE. TO LIKE TO CLARIFY. WE ALSO WOULD LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER. THAT IT SHOULD BE THE WALKED AND NOT THE WHO THAT IS BEING -- DEALT WITH HERE -- THERE ARE OTHER. TECHNOLOGIES THAT USE THE SAME TYPE OF INFORMATION -- CELL SITE INFORMATION LIKE THIS IS THE GPS AND THE LIKE -- AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. ALL THE DATA THAT'S SIMILARLY SITUATED SHOULD BE -- DEALT WITH THE SAME WAY -- MIND OF YOU OF THE TIMING. WELL I GUESS SIX MINUTES RIGHT. COULD NOT GET [inaudible] THIS KID. I'M ALMOST FINISHED -- BUT WELL ANYWAY. YOU GET THE THEN I THINK THAT THE OTHER POINT OF CONFUSION IS THAT IT IT IT ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PUT INTO A CODE SECTION THAT'S THAT'S ALSO HAS FEDERAL IMPLICATIONS I THOUGHT SO I THINK THERE'S CONFUSION -- THAT COULD RESULT FROM THIS WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOAL IS WE SUPPORT THE GOAL OF THE SAME INFORMATION BEING TREATED THE SAME WAY -- AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH MR WENT SO -- THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES. ANY QUESTION FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- YES MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE FOLLOWED BY MISTER GIBSON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO MISS IRWIN WAS YOU MENTIONED -- SOME INVESTIGATIVE REPORTING THAT HAD AND COVERED THIS. WAS THIS -- THE ARTICLE THAT WAS IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THAT REALLY SHOWED OUT ONCE -- INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED THEY WERE IN FACT TRACKING CHILDREN -- ON THEIR WAY TO SCHOOL AND COULD DETERMINE HOW LONG THEY WERE IN SCHOOL AND WHERE THEY WERE GOING AFTERWARDS. THEY WERE TRACKING OR ABLE TO TRACK WHEN A SOMEONE WAS GOING TO VISIT THEIR DOCTOR -- A NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE PRIVATE -- SPACES YOU COULD ARGUE WERE BEING VIOLATED IS IT THAT SAME ARTICLE AS IT IS ABSOLUTELY THAT SAME DISTURBING ARTICLE. OKAY THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I FOUND THAT TO BE INCREDIBLY DISTURBING AND FOR FOLKS WHO MAY BE -- AND VIOLENCE SITUATIONS ARE CHILDREN WHO ARE UNDER AGE -- AND THEIR PRIVACY NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED -- IT REALLY WASN'T ALARMING -- INDICATION OF HOW WE CAN DO MORE TO PROTECT PRIVACY SO THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I KNOW MISS UP TODAY. OF A FINE IS IN THIS TOPIC VERY INTERESTING I WANT A ONE APPRECIATED THANK THE OFFER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- BASED ON THE COMMENTS I LIVE MY COMMENTS -- WITH THE SAME CONCERNS THAT -- MISS COME LIKE A JOB JUST EXPRESSING MOMENTS AGO REGARDING THE ARTICLE CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT VERY BRIEFLY IN TERMS OF ONE THE WRITTEN PARKS THAT NEEDS TO BE OBTAINED IF YOU CAN -- FOR TO OPT YEAH I GUESS IS TO OPT OUT. OF SUCH AND THEN ALSO. IT WAS THE THING MISS CARSON MADE MENTION ABOUT A GREAT AREA THAT SEEMINGLY COULD BE VERY OFTEN TO THE FEDERAL -- REGULATIONS OR HAVE JURISDICTION AT AREA. SO -- CURRENTLY THIS IN. THE USERS ARE NOT OPTING IN ARE OPTING OUT TO THIS INFORMATION IT WAS JUST BEING SOLD TO DATA BROKERS WHO SOLD IT TO BOUNTY HUNTERS AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST THING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PEOPLE. IF THEY WANT THEIR CELL PHONE INFORMATION REAL TIME LOCATION INFORMATION SOLD. THAN THEY NEEDED -- TO OFTEN TO THAT. THE GRAY AREA THIS IS THIS IS BASICALLY THIS IS KIND OF THE SAME AS WHAT WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WITH LAND LINES WE HAVE -- WE HAVE FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND THEN WE HAVE THE SAME THING MIRRORED IN IT AND AT THE C. P. U. C. THIS WOULD DO THE SAME THING NOW IT'S MY MOBILE INFORMATION IS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND REGULATED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WHERE THIS IS ALREADY. NOT ALLOWED SO WE WOULD MAYOR THAT IN CALIFORNIA CODE AND THAT THERE WOULD BE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ON THAT -- AND AT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ONE OF THE OTHER -- THE OPPOSITION'S OTHER ISSUES WAS A WHY SHOULDN'T THIS OF THE COVER OF YOU KNOW CABLE COMPANIES AND AND OTHER. DATA COMPANIES THAT MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO THE CELL PHONE INFORMATION THIS IS REALLY JUST DEALING WITH. THE PLAYERS THAT WORD. DOING THE BAD ACT NOW -- SO WE DON'T WANT TO BRING EVERYBODY INTO IT WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD THE CEOS TO THEIR PROMISES WHICH WAS. THAT THEY WERE NOT GOING TO BE SELLING THIS REAL TIME OR NEAR REAL TIME INFORMATION TO A DATA BROKERS UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO IT. I THINK THE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION THIS CROSS AND INDICATED THAT THERE HE DID TO DESCRIBE THAT THE INCIDENT DID IN FACT HAPPEN THERE'S A MIDDLE MAN THAT DID IT. AND THEY'RE QUICKLY TRY TO ADDRESSED IT ADDRESSES SO WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN -- AND AND WE A KNOWLEDGE OF THAT COMPANY HAS TAKEN THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP BUT THERE'S OTHER COMPANIES. WHO -- POTENTIALLY COULD BE DOING THIS AS WELL THAT WE ARE UNAWARE OF IN THIS BILL WILL OF COURSE ADDRESS. A NUMBER OF THOSE ISSUES OUTSTANDING CORRECT AND AND THEY AGREED NOT TO DO IT BUT THEN -- THAT WAS A SECOND ARTICLE THAT AT THAT THAT THAT IT HAD BEEN DONE AGAIN. BY THE SAME COMPANY -- OR ANOTHER COMPANY. YEAH THAT'S IT THAT'S IT IN IN GENERAL THE REPORTER WAS ABLE TO FIND THEIR THEY WERE ABLE TO BUY THEIR LOCATION DATA AFTER THIS ARTICLE CAME OUT SO -- I KNOW EVERYBODY MEANS WELL MAYBE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO WIND ALL THIS DOWN BUT AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALL LONGER DOES MENTIONED WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POTENTIALLY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS -- BEING FOLLOWED IN REAL TIME BY THEIR ABUSERS THAT'S HIGHLY PROBLEMATIC SO WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR LEADING INTHIS SPACE AND I KNOW THE CYBERSECURITY YOU'VE BEEN A YOU KNOW A TRAILBLAZER IN THIS AREA AND AND CERTAINLY -- CONTINUE ON IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO BRING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION OB ACCORDING TODAY. IT'S SOMETHING THEN THEY GIVE THIS QUIRK SILVA FOLLOWED BY MR OBERNOLTE. YEAH AGAIN THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER IRWIN FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS AREA -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING FOR THE PUBLIC IS BECAUSE SOME OF THE ISSUES YOU'VE TALKED TO US ABOUT AND BILLS YOU BROUGHT FORWARD. RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND MANY OTHERS. IS THEY HAVE ABOUT. A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF INFORMATION OF RELATED TO WHAT THEY'RE GIVING OUT AND WHAT'S BEING USED. SO I THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY -- EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND THAT IF PERHAPS THROUGH -- OUR DISTRICT OFFICES WE COULD HOLD SOME -- SOME TYPE OF INFORMATIONAL -- AND WORKSHOPS ON THAT. SO THAT'S JUST A COMMENT ON IT BECAUSE THIS ISRAEL AREA IN FULLER TEN OF NOT TOO LONG AGO ABOUT TWO TO THREE YEARS AGO -- THERE WAS A CASE OF THAT THE POLICE WERE INVOLVED THROUGH CAL STATE FULLERTON WHERE -- A MAN WAS TRACKING A YOUNG LADIES THROUGH THEIR GPS. ON A LINE KNOWING WHERE THEY WERE. NOT GOING AFTER THEM BUT GOING TO WHERE THEY LIVED. AND WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR APARTMENTS AND ACTUALLY **** PERSONAL ITEMS AND THEY FOUND. THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY DOING THAT AT CAL STATE FULLERTON BUT ALSO CHAPMAN COLLEGE. AND THEY PUT THE INFORMATION TOGETHER AND IT TURNED OUT. THEY WERE ABLE TO CONVICT HIM OF HE WHEN THEY WENT TO HIS RIGHT IS RESIDENT HE HAD SOME -- MANY MANY BAGS OF IF YOU WANT TO CALL AND PANTIES. HE WAS CALLED THE PANTY SNATCHER BUT OF THE GIRLS ACTUALLY. IT WAS SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T REALLY NOTICE TO BUT HE WAS THERE AND THIS IS RESET THIS IS JUST LIKE TWO YEARS AGO AND FULLER TEN AND CHECK OUT MAN. AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET IN AND KNOW WHERE THEY WERE BY THE INFORMATION THEY PROVIDED. SO --I APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT -- THESE ARE REAL -- SCENARIOS THANK YOU AND AND THE I. APPRECIATE ALWAYS THE CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO EDUCATE EVERYBODY ABOUT MAKING SUE THAT OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL YOUR APPS. MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE LOCATION SERVICES OFFER ALL THOSE THAT REALLY DON'T NEED YOUR LOCATION SERVICES AND AND THERE HAS. CERTAINLY RECENTLY BEEN A STORY ABOUT. ONE APP THAT WAS SELLING OF ALL YOUR LOCATION INFORMATION AFTER THE FACT TWO OF MANY MANY DATA BROKERS AND AND AGAIN WE NEED TO BE AWARE AS OF CAN AS CONSUMERS. THAT WE HAVE CONTROL OVER THE GPS THE DATA THAT'S ON OUR PHONES. I WANNA HOLD JUST ONE SECOND WHAT WE GOT OF MEMBERS HERE ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS SECRETARY. IN A GET THE CONSENT CALENDAR. IT.

IS TO DOES CURRENT STATE LAW AND FEDERAL LAW ALREADY ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY NO SO I'VE I'VE JUST GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I COULD BIG THE COMMITTEE'S INDULGENCE BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO GET TO A YES HERE -- THAT IF WE CAN GET MISTER CARLSON BACK UP I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR HIM AS WELL. SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN ASSERED IS THAT THIS MIGHT TO RATE CONFUSION BECAUSE UNDER CURRENT STATE PRIVACY LAW THERE'S A RITE OF OPT OUT. AND THIS WOULD CREATE A RITE OF OPT IN AND THE QUESTION HAS BEEN RAISED IF A CONSUMER WERE TO OPT IN IN ONE PLACE AND OUT ON THE OTHER PLACE -- WOULD NOT CREATE SO -- SOME CONFUSION ON THE PART OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY AS TO WHAT TO DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. OKAY SO IT'S A PART OF THE CODE THAT ALREADY EXISTS FOR THE LAND LINE BA YEAH YEAH. I KNOW IT AT THAT IF YOU SEE CODE. ARE NO I'M TALKING ABOUT THE C. CPA. SINCE THIS IS DIGITAL INFORMATION. OUT AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT WE CAN DAVID THIS FOR CARLSON CAN [inaudible] AND AND THREE FIVE AND I KNOW THE CHAIR -- I'M SORRY THE AUTHOR WILL BE ANSWERED A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS AND AND PRIVACY. AS WELL SO THE BEING MORE OF THAT AREA IT'S BUT NONE THE LESS YOU OF WHAT WILL GET BACK TO YOU ON ITS -- IT'S THE SAME CONFLICT THAT WILL EXIT THAT EXISTS FOR THE LAND LINE ALSO. SO I THINK YOU SAID WAS MOST RECENT -- ACTION. OKAY WELL WHAT. WE'LL BE SEEING IT AGAIN PRIVACY SO TWIX NOW AND THEN -- IF YOU CAN TOTAL DOWN ON THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT -- DEFINITELY WELL THANK YOU SO. ANOTHER MR CARSON THIS QUESTION FOR YOU ANOTHER QUESTION A ANOTHER -- ASSERTION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT'S BEEN RAISED IS THAT FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS LAWS ALREADY PREVENTS. NON ANONYMIZED DATA FROM BEING SOLD. AND OP I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I WONDER HOW IT IS THAT. THIS DATA COULD HAVE BEEN SOLD TO A MIDDLE MAN IN A FORMAT THAT. ALLOW THEM TO BE OF USE TO SOMEONE LIKE A PARTY HOW TO OR EVEN A ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE COMPANY IF THAT WERE TRUE -- THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS -- TO THAT TO THAT RULE AND I I THERE ARE LIMITATIONS RIGHT -- USING STORED COMMUNICATIONS INFORMATION TO YOUR LOCATION -- I THINK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN -- GENERAL GEOLOCATION IMPRECISE YOUR LOCATION -- IN THIS INSTANCE I THINK WHAT THEY DO IS THEY CAN TAKE THAT AND% THEN ADD MORE INTO A TO TO TRACK TO TRACK THE INDIVIDUAL BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- LET ME GO FURTHER ON THAT AND GET BACK TO YOU OKAY. AND AND OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE F. C. C.'S THAT THAT IS THE CASE OF BUT THE FCC IS NOT ENFORCING IT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. I AM LAST QUESTION WOULD BE CONCERNING THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WHICH IS SOMETHING I'M NORMALLY NOT A BIG FAN OF BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE SAY THAT SOMETHING IS ILLEGAL WE HAVE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT SHOULD BE ENFORCING THAT. ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF LARGE CLASSES OF CONSUMERS AND I'D RATHER LEAVE IT WITH THAT AGENCY THEY ON CREATE A POSSIBLE PROFIT MOTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO GO AFTER -- SO IN THIS CASE THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MITIGATES IN MY OPINION AGAINST THE BILL BUT I WANTED TO ASK BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A SECTION HERE THAT ALLOWS THAT IT I REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE AN ADDED TO THAT IT'S WAS CURRENTLY IN CITY CORD WHICH ARE. WHICH ARE ADDING THIS PARTICULAR CLASS OF DATA TO THE THINGS THAT ARE ACTIONABLE UNDER THAT WHICH HAS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION RIGHT SO I'M WONDERING IF SOMEONE WERE TO BRING SUIT. FOR DAMAGES WHICH IS ALL THE STATE COACH RIGHTLY SAYS IS YOU KNOW THEY CAN RECOVER THEIR DAMAGES WHAT MIGHT THOSE DAMAGES BE I MEAN WHAT WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WHEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ALLOWING SOMEONE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO SUE. UP UNDER THIS BILL. NOW I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY SO I MEAN I COULD COME UP WITH ALL SORTS OF IDEAS OF OF WHAT DAMAGES COULD BE BUT SINCE I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY I I REALLY WOULD PREFER TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. OKAY ALL EITHER IF YOU'RE HELPING ME MUCH BUT WELL IF YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS VERY COMPLICATED GOOD NEWS. GOOD NEWS IS YOU HAVE A REASONABLE TIME TO DEBATE BEFORE YOU VOTE ON THE FLOOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEEING NONE WITH THE OFF LIKE CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER. THANK YOU A MISS IRWIN.

IMPORTANT TO ME IS -- THERE ARE. SERVICES IN MY COMMUNITY THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND FREE AND HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN -- WE KNOW ESPECIALLY IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ABILITY TO CALL HOME -- FOR FREE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- AND THANKS TO INNOVATIONS AND AND TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW AND AND THINGS LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENED SKYPE WE NOW HAVE THAT ABILITY WE NO LONGER HAVE INTERNATIONAL CALLING CARDS ON ON SEVEN ELEVEN'S EVERYWHERE AND THAT THAT IS A HUGE SAVINGS FOR FOR A COMPANY LIKE MINE. HOWEVER I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT AN AND REGULATES COMPLETELY UNREGULATED -- RESIDENTIAL VOICE -- SITUATION AND I JUST WANT TO ALLAY THOSE CONCERNS WITH A FEW THINGS THAT I WANT TO ENSURE THAT THAT FOLKS. WHO ARE GOING TO BE IN OPPOSITION THAT WE ARE CONTINUE TO WORK ON WITH THEM? AT THIS BILL FOR MOVES FORWARD WE WILL -- CONTINUE TO ADD CONSUMER PROTECTIONS A WORKER PROTECTIONS AROUND DISCLOSURE TO REQUIRE PROVIDER OF WHAT SERVICES TO DISCLOSE TO CONSUMER DURING THE SALES TRANSACTION FOR VOIGTS SERVICES THAT THE CONSUMER HAS THE RIGHT TO BASIC TELEPHONE SERVICE -- WE'RE LOOKING TO HAVE THIS WRITTEN SO THAT THE CONSUMER COULD CALL THE QC OR PERHAPS GO TO WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING BASIC SERVICE. WE WANT TO ADD -- INSURANCE ABOUT SERVICE RESTORATION STANDARDS REQUIRE -- INTER CONNECTED RESIDENTIAL BOYCHOIR% LINE TO MEET. DEFINED STANDARDS OF SERVICE RESTORATION TIMELINE THE SAME WAY. TRADITIONAL PHONES DO. AND A PERCENTAGE WITHIN THOSE TIME LINES EXCEPT IN CASES OF DISASTER OR CASES BEYOND PROVIDER CONTROL -- PRO RATE AND SERVICE CREDITS WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN ENFORCEMENT TO REQUIRE. THE UC TO SUBMIT A REPORT ABOUT STANDING NEW COMPLAINTS REGARDING WHITE AND I P. ENABLE SERVICES TO THE AG MONTHLY THOSE ARE SOME OF THINGS WE HOPE TO WORK ON OVER US. AS WE MOVE HOPEFULLY MOVE THIS BILL AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT WOULD BE THREE TWO MINUTES THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS HAS BEEN DIVIDED AND I AM THE EDUCATIONAL MANAGER. OF THE SALVADORAN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL FUND SALAS. OUR MISSION IS TO PROMOTE THE CIVIC PARTICIPATION -- PRESENTATION OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY IS AN AMERICAN UNITS IN THE US WE WORK TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A PLACE WHERE ALL PEOPLE ENJOY ECONOMICAL SECURITY. SOCIAL JUSTICE AND POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT. I AM HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ LEGISLATION AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX AND TO TALK ABOUT WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS SO IMPORTANT -- TO LATINO AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA LATINO MOBILE PHONE OWNERSHIP HAS REACHED AN INCREDIBLE 97% AND HAS WE HAVE SEEN IN THE RECENT YEARS NEW TECHNOLOGY APPS AND SERVICES. HAVE BEEN LIFE CHANGING FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND YOU IMMIGRANTS FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND RECENT IMMIGRANTS THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND APPS WITHIN THE PRO PROVIDE US. OF LIFELINE AWAY TO CONNECT WHAT WE LEFT BEHIND. THEY PROVIDE COMMUNITY FOR THOSE THAT FEEL ALONE IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR OTHERS THEY PROVIDE A GATEWAY TO WORK IN EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS WHAT'S UP ARE PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT TO RECENT IMMIGRANTS THE STEPS ARE RELATIVELY NEW SERVICES AND APPS PROVIDE FREE COMMUNICATION WILLOW ONCE IN AND ABROAD. TALK A LITTLE BIT OF PERSONAL -- EXPERIENCE I AM THE DAUGHTER SALVADORAN IMMIGRANT STUFF THAT A VERY BLOODY CIVIL WAR I HAVE FAMILY THAT WERE POLITICAL REFUGEES ALL OVER THE WORLD. I HAVE UNCLES AND PAIR IS I HAVE FAMILY IN MOTHER HEAT I HAVE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA FAMILY IN CANADA AND WITHOUT SUCH AN APP LIKE WHAT'S UP I WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY FAMILY TWO TIMES A WEEK I SET MY ALARM I ONE THIRTY A. M. TO CALL MY UNCLE AND CHECK IN WITH HIM AND IT'S MY HIGHLIGHT OF MY WEEK. AND THEN RECENTLY CELEB HAS EXPANDED OUR OUR HUMANITARIAN WORK WORKING WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS AND NOT JUST CENTRAL AMERICAN ASYLUM SEEKERS WORKING WITH AFRICAN ASYLUM SEEKERS HAITIAN I FIND SEEKERS. AND ALSO -- INTERNALLY DISPLACED PEOPLE IN MEXICO AND DEPORTED PEOPLE AND BE ONE NOT SO WE'RE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR SHELTERS AND PEOPLE DOING THE WORK AND THE FINAL. TWO PEOPLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES -- IN ADDITION TO SERVICES LIKE WHAT'S UP AND OTHER TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS SKYPE THAT HAVE BECOME HOUSEHOLD NAMES THERE ARE COUNTLESS OTHER ABSENCE SERVICES HELP AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU THE TIME AND I WANT TO MAKE THEIR EVERYBODY YES -- JUST CALL HIM. FOR THIS REASON I ASK FOR THE SUPPORT FOR THE A. B.. THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRIS ROSE ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT ALLIANCE. TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IS PARAMOUNT TO KEEPING THE DOORS OPEN FOR NON PROFITS IN CALIFORNIA NON PROFITS RELY ON ACCESS TO DATA THE PRICE OF DATA SKYROCKETS AS WE BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN IF THE PC IS ALLOWED TO UNNECESSARILY EXPAND ITS REACH. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INCREASED INCREASED PRICES HIGHER PRICES OF DATA MEANS CHARITIES WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO ABSORB THE COST IN THOSE CHARITIES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO STAY OPEN WILL HAVE TO SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THEIR PROGRAMS. WE USE CONSUMER DATA AND THIRD PARTY DATA PROVIDERS TO ENSURE MARKETING MESSAGES ARE DELIVERED TO THOSE WERE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT. WITHOUT THIS FAIR PRICE DATA NONPROFITS CANNOT EFFECTIVELY CONNECT WITH THOSE WHO TARGET FOR PROGRAMMATIC COMMISSIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE COST PRESSURES WOULD IMPACT THE UNITED FARM WORKERS ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR WORKERS OUR PARTNERS AT THE U. F.. W. ARGUE CALIFORNIA FARMWORKERS WOULD NOT RECEIVE KEY INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS UNDER STATE LAW INCLUDING SHADE WATER BREAKS PROTECTIVE CLOTHING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OFF THE CLOCK WORK EMPLOYER PROVIDED TOOLS THE RIGHT TO CONCERNED ACTIVITY. INTO IMPROVE WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS IF DATA BECOMES COST PROHIBITIVE IF THE PC IS ALLOWED TO EXPAND ITS REACH NONPROFITS MAY BE THE FIRST TO SEPARATE THE FIRST. FULL IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE WYLER COMPER COMMERCIAL PARTNERS ARE FORCED TO INCREASE THEIR DATA PRICES INCREASES THAT NONPROFITS CANNOT ABSORB. AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX PROTECTS CHARITIES AND NON PROFITS BY PREVENTING UNNECESSARY AND POTENTIALLY DEVASTATING COST PRESSURES. NEEDLESS P. YOU SEE REACH WHILE STILL PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY. FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SPORT. YES -- MY NAME IS ERIC BROWN ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH NETWORK WHICH IS THE LARGEST COLLABORATIVE. OF SAFETY NET CLINICS AND HOSPITALS IN THE STATE. THAT ARE SERVING UNDERSERVED AND RURAL PATIENT POPULATIONS. I WANT TO START WITH JUST A VERY BRIEF STORY AND ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES. AND I DON'T WANT TO RUN A FILE BUT I WAS I WAS IN THE TOWN OF TEHACHAPI LAST WEEK IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO HATCH BE IS. IT -- IS IN THE MOUNTAINS THAT ROOM -- THE CENTRAL VALLEY FRONT AND A MOJAVE DESERT. IT IS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL THERE -- IN THAT TOWN A YOUNG MOM DECIDES SHE WANTS -- TO HAVE A HOME BIRTH OF HER BABY WITH A MIDWIFE -- THE THERE ARE PROBLEMS -- THEY GO TO THE LOCAL CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL IN TO HATCH A P.. WHERE THEY REALIZE THEY DON'T HAVE THE PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE EXPERTISE THEY NEED BUT BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN IP ENABLED BROADBAND CONNECTION? THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA TELEHEALTH NETWORK SUPPLIED BY AT AND T. IN THIS CASE. TO VALLEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ABOUT TWO HOURS AND SORRY ABOUT THREE HOURS AWAY AND IN MADERA -- THE BABY'S LIFE IS SAFE THEY'RE ABLE TO BE MEN OF VIDEO CONFERENCE -- TO GET THE EXPERTISE THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THAT CHILD. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE SEE AND HEAR ABOUT EVERYDAY -- IN OUR TRAVELS. IT COULD NOT BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE RIGHT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK -- THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR ORGANIZATION WAS ACTUALLY FORMED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE ABOUT THE TIME THAT THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. WAS PUT IN PLACE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH INNOVATORS INNOVATION COMPANIES IN THE HEALTH CARE SPACE. TO SEE HOW WE CAN USE TECHNOLOGY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE IN RURAL AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. TWO YEARS AGO WE MERGED WITH AN ORGAN BASED NONPROFIT WITH A SIMILAR MISSION CALLED OCEAN OCA CHAYANNE IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF THEM. THEY DO -- INNOVATION ARE AROUND HOW DATA IS HANDLED IN INFORMATION IS SHARED. FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS NOW ALL OVER THE COUNTRY -- WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH -- CHIN TO EXPAND THE REACH OF IBM ABLE SERVICES IN TWO WORLD AND SAFETY NET CLINIC. IS A TIME -- AND IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE ALSO SUPPORT -- THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL -- SUPPORT WITNESSES. AGAIN NAME ORGANIZATION. AND POSITION ONLY PLEASE.

PAM LIMITS ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS IN SUPPORT. GEN GET ALL OUR O. C. SACRAMENTO PRESIDENT. IN SUPPORT. BUT SHEPHERD REPRESENTING THE CAL ASIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. ANY MAIN OPPOSITION WITNESSES. INCOME OF THE TABLE NOW PLEASE YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M REGION ACOSTA FOR TURN -- WE'RE IN OPPOSITION IN A THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE MAJORITY OF PHONE LINES IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT VûI. AND NOW THEY ARE. ULTIMATELY ALL LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE WILL BE PROVIDED OVER V. O. I. P.. AND MUCH OF NOT ALL OF OUR VOICE AND DATA IS NOW TRANSMITTED AT LEAST IN PART OVER NETWORKS IT THAT. UTILIZE IP ENABLED SERVICES. IF THIS BILL WAS ABOUT APPS WE WOULD NOT BE IN THIS ROOM. BUT IT ISN'T IT'S MUCH MUCH BROADER IT HAS TO DO WITH OVERSIGHT OVER ALL OF OUR CRITICAL COMMUNICATION SERVICES. V. O. I. P. UNDER THIS BILL NO STATE AGENCY COULD TAKE ACTION AT ADDRESSING KEY TELECOMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC SAFETY OR CONSUMER PROTECTION ISSUES INVOLVING AN IP ENABLE TELECOM SERVICE. AND LET'S THE LEGISLATURE SPECIFICALLY PASSED A LAW ALLOWING IT. MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA LAND LINE PHONE SERVICE CUSTOMERS TO CALL ALERTS. AT AND T. AND OTHER VOIP PROVIDERS SAY THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE COMMISSION'S DISASTER RELIEF CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX SEEKS TO EXTEND. THE CPUC CANNOT REQUIRE VOIP PROVIDERS OFFER LAND LINE DISCOUNTS TO LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FOR BIDDING THE CPUC FROM OVERSEEING VOICE. PUTS THAT PROGRAM AT RISK TO THE DETRIMENT OF PEOPLE ON LOW INCOMES INCLUDING THE ELDERLY AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. CARRIER OF LAST RESORT OBLIGATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO VOIP PROVIDERS WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO ALL CUSTOMERS WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION. THE DAY COMES WHEN V. O. I. P. IS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN THOSE PROTECTIONS DISAPPEAR. IN AN ALL I. P. WORLD CUSTOMERS LOSE THE RIGHT TO FILE COMPLAINTS THAT ARE ADDRESSED BY THE CPUC OR ANY OTHER STATE AGENCY. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE NO ONE COULD FORESEE THE NEED FOR ELECTRIC UTILITIES TO SHUT OFF POWER TO PREVENT OR MITIGATE THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES BUT THAT IS NOW OUR REALITY. MOST CUSTOMERS ARE USING VOICE THOSE SERVICES THE NETWORKS DEPEND ON COMMERCIAL POWER TO FUNCTION AND STATE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH ENSURING PUBLIC SAFETY AND RELIABLE COMMUNICATION THAT'S GOING TO OVER TWO MINUTES BUT THE REP -- NO MATTER WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS BEING USED WE CANNOT COMPROMISE CONSUMER PROTECTION PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN SANTIAGO IN MEMBERS. I'M TOM RUNYAN I'M PROUD TO SERVE AS VICE PRESIDENT OF CW A DISTRICT NINE REPRESENTING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY HAVE BEEN HEARING DIRECTLY. FROM CONSUMERS REGARDING PROBLEMS WITH THEIR PHONE SERVICE OUR MEMBERS OF ALSO WITNESSED SAFETY ISSUES WITH PHONE LINES THAT HAVE BEEN NEGLECTED. DUE TO LACK OF PROPER OVERSIGHT AND REGULATION. UNFORTUNATELY OUR WORKERS DO NOT SEE THESE ISSUES GETTING ANY BETTER WITHOUT STATE INTERVENTION SOMETHING THAT CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS. THE DEREGULATION OF VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICE UNDER SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE HAS LED TO SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. TRADITIONAL LANDLINE TELEPHONE COME CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. WITH THE C. P. U. C. AND THE COMMISSION CAN TAKE ACTION. THEY CAN BE SURE OUTAGES WILL BE RESTORED WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THEY CAN ASSUME THAT THEIR CALLS WILL BE ANSWERED IN A REASONABLE TIME. UNFORTUNATELY VOIGTS USERS HAVE NO SUCH ASSURANCES OR PROTECTIONS. CW A TECHNICIANS WORKING IN THE FIELD SEE THE DISPARITY FIRST HAND. THEY PRIORITIZE RESTORING TRADITIONAL PHONE SERVICE WILD VOICE CUSTOMERS ARE LEFT WAITING. THIS IS A FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR SITUATION ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT MOST CUSTOMERS HAVE NO IDEA THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SWITCHED TO AVOID -- SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE UNLIKE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE THE MAJORITY OF HOME PHONE SERVICE WOULD NOW BE COVERED BY THE PROVISIONS OF AB. THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX CW A AS LONG SUPPORTED POLICIES THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND HOLD TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICE BY EXTENDING THE PROVISIONS OF SB ELEVEN SIXTY ONE INDEFINITELY AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE WORKERS HAVE IDENTIFIED. BECOME PERMANENT. THIS WOULD GIVE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES VIRTUALLY FREE REIGN TO IGNORE THE NEEDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS. NOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF HOME PHONE CUSTOMERS IN CALIFORNIA OUR ENVOY SWARM WITH A NEW THE TIME LIMITS. WITH SERVICE SWITCHING MORE AND MORE EACH DAY. THE DEFEAT OF AB THIRTEEN SIXTY SIX WILL RESTORE CRITICAL PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. THEREFORE WE REQUEST AND URGED A NO VOTE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIR AND I THOUGHT THE I GO FASTER OBERNOLTE AYE AYE ERNESTO WITH THE F. F. -- IF THAT'S OPPOSITE OPPOSITION TO THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY DIFFERENT IN NATURE WE ARE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THE FUTURE OF BROADBAND ACCESS COMPETITION. A PROHIBITION ON STATE COUNTY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE HAVING ANY AUTHORITY OVER IP BASED SERVICES I. E. BROADBAND. WHEN THE FUTURE OF HIGH SPEED ACCESS RIGHT NOW IS DEVOLVING TO A HIGH SPEED CABLE MONOPOLY WILL MEAN HIGHER PRICES FOR AND WHAT LACK OF CHOICE FOR MOST OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS? ASK YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY HOW MANY CHOICES THEY HAVE AT HOME RIGHT NOW WHEN IT COMES OF FAST INTERNET SPEEDS AND MAJORITY WILL TELL YOU. ONE OR NOT. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHEN THIS LAW WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY TWELVE IT DOESN'T TWELVE MOST CALIFORNIA TWO OR THREE CHOICES. FOR SPEED THE QUALIFIED FOR BROADBAND AND GOOGLE WAS ENTERING THE MARKET. YOU HAD A THE FCC REGULATE BROADBAND FOR PROMOTING COMPETITION ACCESS BUT TODAY YOU HAVE NONE OF THESE. TODAY GOOGLE STOP THE POINT FIBER VERIZON DOESN'T TO PLAY FILES IN EIGHTEEN TEASE FIBER DEPLOYMENT IS A GOVERNMENT MANDATE THAT SEAT WILL EXPIRE BY THIS YEAR. GOVERNMENT DATA INDICATES THAT RULE AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE FACING MONOPOLIES ARE MOST LIKELY FACE MONOPOLIES. IN THE IN THE IN THE HIGH SPEED SERVICES. AND THAT'S NOT THE SAME STORY IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WHERE THEY STILL REGULATE THEIR TALK OF SERVICES. LASTLY I WANT TO RAISE A NAY THE VERY SPECIFIC NARROW ISSUE BUT THIS BILL RATE REPRESENTS. IN REGARDS OF HOW CAN A CATEGORICAL IT'S BEEN IS OVER BE VOICE SERVICES. AS I AGREE OF THE THE SENTIMENT IF THIS WAS ABOUT APPLICATIONS LIKE HAT'S HAPPENED SKYPE WE WILL NOT BE HERE IF WE'RE NOT BE INVOLVED IN OPPOSITION. AND I WOULD KNOW BUT NONE OF THE SUPPORTERS ARE ARE AT THE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. IF IT HAS WORKED OF CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS PROMOTE JUSTICE FOR INMATES AND THEIR FAMILIES WHEN IT COMES TO IN MAKE CARRIER SERVICES THIS IS A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY BEEN YOUR COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY. THESE ARE SIMPLY TELEPHONE COMPANY FOR PRINTS. THE FCC INTERVENE. A FEW YEARS AGO BECAUSE THOSE COMPANIES ARE CHARGING IT THE FAMILIES OF INMATES FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE PERFORMANCE PHONE CALLS. BUT THE FEDERAL COURT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THE FCC CAN ONLY REGULATE LONG DISTANCE CALLS THE STATE HAS TO REGULATE LOCAL CALLS. TODAY ON LIKE TWENTY TWELVE IS MORRELL YOU THE TIME TO GET THOSE SERVICES ARE VOICE SERVICES NOT LEBANESE. FOR THESE REASONS OTHERS I URGE YOU TO REJECT THIS LEGISLATION. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ANY ADDITIONAL OPPOSITION WITNESSES. JUST A REMINDER NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION ONLY MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW MARKETS WITH THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT ADVOCATE AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND OPPOSITION.

PROCESS AND I HEARD YOU SAY ALSO THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS SOMEONE BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. AND THIS BILL IN ENJOYS A DO PASS AS AMENDED ON TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. I WOULD I'M SURE THE CHAIR WILL TAKE A LOOK AT IT -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD -- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT YOU KNOW A LOT OF WHAT THE OPPOSITION SAYS I DON'T DISAGREE WITH WE WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF ENSURING -- THAT RURAL AREAS IN UNDERSERVED AREAS HAVE SERVICE THAT THEY HAVE SERVICE RESTORED THIS SPECIFICALLY KEEPS THE P. YOU SEE OUT OF THE GAME AND A PUTS THOSE REGULATIONS IN OUR HANDS AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT -- FROM THE TIME THAT SI PC DIRECTED STAFF TO ADD NEW SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY TO THE DEATH AND DISABLE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM IT HAS BEEN NINE YEARS IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IS STILL NOT FINALIZED IN ANOTHER EXAMPLE WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AFTER WIRELESS CONSUMERS BEGAN PAYING INTO THE LIFELINE FUND. BEFORE THEY BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR LIFELINE IN TWO MORE YEARS BEFORE VOIGTS CUSTOMERS ARE CONSUMERS ARE ELIGIBLE -- FOR THE TWO PC PROCEEDINGS MY ASSERTION IN THIS IS THAT YOU SEE IS NOT WORKING IT'S GREAT A TO SUGGEST THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SOMETHING WORSE WHEN ACTUALLY THIS IS. EIGHT AN AREA THAT SHOULD BE LEFT TO US IT SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE COMPLAINTS OF OF OUR CONSTITUENTS NOW WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON THAT THE COMPLAIN ISSUE I A LIVE IN AN UNDERSERVED AREA. ABSOLUTELY I LIVE IN THE HEAD LOVE LOVE MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I WILL TELL YOU IT IS HARD WE DO NOT GET THE SAME SERVICE AS SOMEBODY IN. AND MAYBE. MISS BURKHALTER VICE CITY START UP. IT THAT'S A THAT'S OKAY IT'S NOT OKAY ACTUALLY I'M BUT WHAT WE NEED TO WORK ON IT IS HOW I'M SORRY -- WE JUST LIVE IN DIFFERENT AREAS AND IN THE SERVICE PROVIDED IS DIFFERENT AND WE DO WANT TO IN NEED TO ENSURE THAT BOTH THAT THE SERVICE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SERVICE AND FOR COMPLAINTS AND TO HAVE THOSE FOLLOWED UP ON IS EQUAL AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH CW. WAY ON ADDRESSING THAT SITUATION I MEAN THE FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION I TALK TO THEM EVERY DAY OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT DOING SOMETHING TO OPPOSE LABOR THESE ARE THE PEOPLE. I COME FROM AND I REPRESENT AND THEY THEY LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY WE WANT TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK BY WHICH ACTUALLY SERVICE WILL WILL IMPROVE THAT WE CAN HAVE ACCESS TO SERVICE THAT WE WILL HAVE RESTORATION TIME. GUARANTEED IF WE LET THAT UP TO THE P. C. WE MIGHT GET A RESTORATION TIME FOURTEEN YEARS FROM NOW. ALL RIGHT SO I I WANT TO INSURE THAT WERE ACTUALLY WRITING THINGS INTO THIS BILL THAT THAT STRENGTHENS THE SERVICE THAT WE'RE GETTING NOW THAT INSURES BY THE WEIGHT THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING NOW WITH FOR CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S ACCESS. TO TO BASIC SERVICE THAT THEY'LL HAVE THAT RIGHT IN THAT KNOWLEDGE I ACTUALLY THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING -- IT IS GOING TO BE MUCH BETTER FOR THE WORKERS IN THE CONSUMERS THEN WHAT THEY WOULD GET UNDER THE P. UC THEY THEY CAN I I UNDERSTAND THE FEAR I UNDERSTAND. JUST THIS IDEA OF REGULATION BUT WE AS LEGISLATORS I THINK I'M FAR BETTER POSITION TO IMMEDIATELY ACT ON THESE THINGS THEN LEAVING IT UP TO THE PC SO THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU DO. TODAY A WE'RE GONNA SEE OTHER BILLS THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON ON VOIGTS SERVICES IN DISASTER AREAS AND AND THINGS COMING THROUGH AND I THINK WE ARE ABLE TO REGULATE THIS IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT THE DAYS OF OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS WHEN THERE WAS A MONOPOLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SERVICES AVAILABLE AND WE DO BY THE WAY WE HAVE SEEN INTERNET. ACCESS TO INTERNET PRICES GO WAY DOWN UNDER UNDER THIS TYPE OF OF NOT REGULATION BY THE PC AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE WITH THAT. WE BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF BEING ABLE TO ACCESS FREE CALLS INTERNATIONALLY BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE -- BENEFIT THAT WE'VE SEEN THANKS TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE P. C. MEDELLIN AND ISSUES LIKE THAT I'M SORRY I HATE. TO TO BE SO DOWN ON THE P. YOU SEE KIND OF BUT IT JUST IT HASN'T BEEN EFFECTIVE AND I KNOW I KNOW THAT MY FRIENDS IN LABOR. UNDERSTAND THAT AND SO I HOPE THAT THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TO MAKE SURE CONSUMERS ARE BETTER OFF WORKERS ARE BETTER OFF BUT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS AND COMPETITION IN A WAY THAT SERVES OUR COMMUNITY THE BASS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY THANK YOU.
