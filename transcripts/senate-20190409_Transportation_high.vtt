00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:25.932
THIS BILL ALLOWS THEM TO

USE FOR A SCHOOL.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.373
NOT FOR THE USE FOR MANSIONS --

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.108
RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE HAS BEEN

HUNTINGTON HOSPITAL. FOR DECADES

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.950
AGAIN IT ALLOWS RONALD MCDONALD

USES AS A GARDEN.

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.940
NOT FOR MANSION SO WE THINK

00:05:08.007 --> 00:05:10.143
THAT'S A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:11.577

TO DO THE THIRD THING THE BILL.

00:05:19.118 --> 00:05:22.889

FROM WHAT CALTRANS IS TOLD ME.

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:41.374
WHETHER WE CALL IT SURPLUS IT'S

00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:42.709
ONE SECTION OF GOVERNMENT CODE

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.610
ABANDONMENT IS ANOTHER SECTION

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:46.779

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.106
POTENTIAL TO REVOLUTIONIZE.

00:19:01.173 --> 00:19:02.574
HOW WE GET AROUND AND RECEIVE

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:04.176
OUR COMMUNITIES?

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:05.911
NOW WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.013
TALK ABOUT HOW THE BY THE GREAT

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.848
PROMISES THAT -- THE THAT THIS

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:11.183
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY MAY BRING

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.518
I MEAN ME DRASTICALLY REDUCE

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:13.418
COLLISIONS.

00:19:13.485 --> 00:19:15.087
ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW THAT'S VERY

00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.189

00:19:17.256 --> 00:19:18.957
THOUGHTFULLY DESPITE DEPLOYED

00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:20.425
THIS NEW MOBILITY REVOLUTION

00:19:20.492 --> 00:19:22.394
COULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:23.929
NEGATIVE IMPACTS INCLUDING

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:24.763
EXACERBATING CALIFORNIA'S

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:25.597

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:27.199
SEVERE CLIMATE AIR QUALITY

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:27.699
PLANNING AND CONGESTION

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.035
CHALLENGES SO IT'S REALLY GONNA

00:19:30.102 --> 00:19:33.605
COME DOWN TO HOW WE IMPLEMENT --

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.174
OVER HOW WE WITH THE SERVER THE

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:37.376
THE THE THOUGHT THAT WE PUT INTO.

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:39.411
THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS

00:19:39.478 --> 00:19:40.846
TECHNOLOGY ONTO OUR ROADS.

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:42.314
I SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES HAVE

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:43.949
FOUND THAT BECAUSE A VIS MAKE

00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.918
TRAVEL LESS ONEROUS.

00:19:45.984 --> 00:19:47.619
THEIR WIDESPREAD ADOPTION COULD

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:49.254
ACTUALLY -- END UP INCREASING

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:52.491
VEHICLE TRAVEL BY 15260%.

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:53.959
IN AN EXPERIMENT CONDUCTED BY UC

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.494
DAVIS UC BERKELEY AND GEORGIA

00:19:55.561 --> 00:19:57.796
TECH MIMICS LIFE WITH THE NAVY

00:19:57.863 --> 00:19:58.430
BY PROVIDING EACH PARTICIPATING

00:19:58.497 --> 00:19:59.331
HOUSEHOLD.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.366
WITH THE SHOW FOR AN EXPERIMENT

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:03.101
SO I HOUSEHOLDS TRAVEL YOU 3%

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:05.571
MORE MILES PER WEEK WITH MORE

00:20:05.637 --> 00:20:06.271
THAN A FIFTH OF THE VEHICLE

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:06.872
TRIPS.

00:20:06.939 --> 00:20:08.640
SENATE CARRYING NO PASSENGERS AT

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:09.107
ALL.

00:20:09.174 --> 00:20:11.276
BUT YOU JUST HAVE THE THE CARS

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:12.544
CIRCULATING.

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:13.312
SO THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.813
AV'S COULD ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.515
TO DRIVE MORE FREQUENTLY COMMUTE

00:20:16.582 --> 00:20:18.050
LONGER DISTANCES USE PUBLIC

00:20:18.116 --> 00:20:19.184
TRANSPORTATION LAST.

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:21.653
THUS INCREASING SPRAWL

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.188
CONGESTION AND POLLUTION.

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:24.423
INSTEAD THESE IMPACTS COULD BE

00:20:24.489 --> 00:20:25.791
AVOIDED IF THE STATE FINDS WAYS

00:20:25.857 --> 00:20:27.125
TO ENCOURAGE RIDE SHARING

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.327
MINIMIZING ZERO OR PASSING A

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:29.394
PASSENGER TRIPS.

00:20:29.461 --> 00:20:30.762
AND QUICKLY MOVE FORWARD TOWARD

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.230
ELECTRIFYING THE FLEET.

00:20:32.297 --> 00:20:33.332
SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:34.499
THAT ARE FLOATING OUT THERE IN

00:20:34.566 --> 00:20:36.034
THIS CONVERSATION I I WE REALLY

00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:38.070
DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY OF KNOWING

00:20:38.136 --> 00:20:39.204
HOW IT IS THAT.

00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:40.539
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY MAY IMPACT I

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:42.341
PRESENT IT'S KIND OF A WORST

00:20:42.407 --> 00:20:43.408
CASE SCENARIO BUT I THINK IT'S

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:43.875
WORTH.

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:44.977
OUR OUR SPENDING SOME TIME

00:20:45.043 --> 00:20:46.311
CONTEMPLATING THAT AND AND AND

00:20:46.378 --> 00:20:47.779
UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

00:20:47.846 --> 00:20:49.181
FOR US TO REALLY STUDY AND GET

00:20:49.247 --> 00:20:50.582
TO THE BOTTOM OF OF THIS.

00:20:50.649 --> 00:20:53.185
POTENTIALLY REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE

00:20:53.251 --> 00:20:54.052
TO THE WAY THAT WE GET AROUND A

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:56.021
PLANNED INCREASE OUR CITY SAID

00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.123
THIS BILL SB FIFTY NINE CREATES.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.058
AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. TO

00:21:00.125 --> 00:21:00.859
DELIBERATELY PLANNED FOR A

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.327
THOMAS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.695
SUPPORTS THE STATE'S PLANNING

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:05.297
CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.865
WITH THE MIND TOWARD AVOIDING.

00:21:06.932 --> 00:21:08.834
POTENTIAL A NEGATIVE IMPACTS

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.568
VERTICALLY THE TRANSPORTATION

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:10.535
SPACE.

00:21:10.602 --> 00:21:12.037
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH MANY

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.739
STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY

00:21:13.805 --> 00:21:14.139
GROUPS AUTOMAKERS

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:15.941
ENVIRONMENTALISTS TO REFINE THE

00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:17.542
MEASURE TO INSURE THAT WE

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.344
DELIVER REALLY PLAN WILL NOT

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:21.680
SIGN ME -- THIS THIS INNOVATIVE

00:21:21.747 --> 00:21:23.081
TECHNOLOGY AND SO I'M VERY

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:24.549
COMMITTED TO WORKING CLOSELY

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.585
WITH -- STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AS

00:21:26.652 --> 00:21:27.853
THE BILL PROCEEDS.

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:28.987
I KNOW THAT WE SAW SOME MORE

00:21:29.054 --> 00:21:30.422
WORK TO DRESS CONCERNS AT THAT

00:21:30.489 --> 00:21:31.657
HAVE BEEN RAISED A CONVERSATIONS

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:33.125
OF AN VERY PRODUCTIVE.

00:21:33.191 --> 00:21:34.259
AND I HAVE WITH ME JASON FROM

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:36.094
THE UNION OF CONCERNED

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:37.596
SCIENTISTS ALSO RIGHT. TO CHARGE

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:43.168
FROM CAL START -- THEY'RE GONNA

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:43.735
BOTH SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:47.139
BILL.

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.940
IN FAVOR PLEASE SHOW THE FLOOR.

00:21:49.007 --> 00:21:49.708
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:50.709
CHASIN BARB US WITH THE UNION OF

00:21:50.776 --> 00:21:51.610
CONCERNED SCIENTISTS AND JUST

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:52.577
BRIEFLY YOU BUILD ON THAT

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:53.211
PRESENTATION CENTER ALLEN JUST

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:53.512
MADE.

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:54.880
ABOUT HOW THE ADVENT OF SELF

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:56.415
DRIVING CARS COULD POSE EITHER

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:59.017
BENEFITS OR RISKS TO OUR CLIMATE.

00:21:59.084 --> 00:21:59.818
AND WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:21:59.885 --> 00:22:03.321
ACT SAID TO STEER THE TECHNOLOGY

00:22:03.388 --> 00:22:04.523
IN A CLIMATE SMART DIRECTION.

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:05.323
MANY RESEARCHERS ARE ARE

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:07.859
ANALYZING THIS ISSUE AND AND HOW

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.461
SELF DRIVING CARS COULD IMPACT

00:22:09.528 --> 00:22:10.996
TRAVEL AND CONGESTION.

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:13.732
AND ACCESSIBILITY I AM POLLUTION

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:15.867
AND IT'S PROVIDING IMPORT

00:22:15.934 --> 00:22:17.402
INSIGHTS INTO HOW -- THE ABOUT

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:18.236
THE POTENTIAL FOR BUILDING A

00:22:18.303 --> 00:22:19.738
MODERN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM BUT

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:20.872
ALSO THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF

00:22:20.939 --> 00:22:22.307
INACTION.

00:22:22.374 --> 00:22:23.008
AND SO YOU KNOW THE POSITIVE

00:22:23.075 --> 00:22:25.377
VISION THAT WE ASPIRE TO FOR

00:22:25.444 --> 00:22:26.845
SUSTAINABILITY IS ONE IN WHICH A

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.014
VIS -- ARE PAIRED WITH ELECTRIC

00:22:29.081 --> 00:22:30.615
VEHICLES WHICH HAVE LOWER CARBON

00:22:30.682 --> 00:22:32.484
EMISSIONS WHILE ALSO USHERING IN

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.119
A NEW WAVE OF TRANSPORTATION

00:22:34.186 --> 00:22:35.721
SERVICES THINK.

00:22:35.787 --> 00:22:37.522
UBER AND LIFT TWO POINT NO WHERE

00:22:37.589 --> 00:22:39.758
SHARED RIDER MORE CONVENIENT AN

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.360
INDIVIDUAL COULD VEHICLE

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:42.828
OWNERSHIP IN OUR COST

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:43.161
COMPETITIVE.

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:44.362
AND WHEN WHEN COMBINED WITH

00:22:44.429 --> 00:22:45.864
INCREASED ACCESS TO MOBILITY

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:47.065
OPTIONS LIKE SHARED BIKES AND

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.934
SHARE SCOOTERS AND EFFICIENT

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.669
MASS TRANSIT AS WELL AS SAFER

00:22:50.736 --> 00:22:51.670
STREETS.

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:52.971
INDIVIDUALS COULD CHOOSE FROM A

00:22:53.038 --> 00:22:54.139
WIDER VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR

00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.607
EACH TRIP RATHER THAN ALWAYS

00:22:55.674 --> 00:22:57.008
DEFAULTING TO THE CAR FORMALLY

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:58.176
PARKED IN THEIR DRIVEWAY.

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:59.444
SO THAT'S THAT'S A POSITIVE

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:00.879
VISION THAT WE'RE SHOOTING FOR

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:01.546
AND THAT WOULD BE LOWERING

00:23:01.613 --> 00:23:03.381
EMISSIONS LOWERING VEHICLE

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.918
TRAVEL -- BUT THERE'S MUCH TO BE

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:07.452
CONCERNED IN TERMS OF THIS

00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:09.721
WEATHER THIS OUTCOME WILL RESULT

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:10.589
WITHOUT PUBLIC POLICY TO TO

00:23:10.655 --> 00:23:11.056
STEER.

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:13.992
ANSWER JUST BRIEFLY A COUPLE OF

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.894
THE RISKS OF THAT -- RESEARCH

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:17.629
HAS HAS UNCOVERED ONE IS THAT

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.030
EIGHTIES COULD DRAMATICALLY

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.098
INCREASE DRIVING.

00:23:20.165 --> 00:23:21.900
SO IF EIGHTIES PRIMARILY ENABLE

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:23.101
INCREASE SINGLE OCCUPANCY

00:23:23.168 --> 00:23:25.137
VEHICLE TRIPS WE ARE CERTAINLY

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:27.372
IN TROUBLE BECAUSE WE ARE ONE OF

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:28.874
THE THE WIDELY CITED STUDIES

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:29.908
FROM RESEARCHERS FROM A NUMBER

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:31.576
OF THE PARTNERSHIP FROM THREE

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:32.611
DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES.

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:35.347
FOUND -- THEY LOOKED AT THE THE

00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:36.715
IMPACT ON TRAVEL BEHAVIOR IN

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:37.349
CARBON EMISSIONS A WHOLE NUMBER

00:23:37.415 --> 00:23:39.050
OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WOULD

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:40.252
COME FROM FROM THE ADVENT OF THE

00:23:40.318 --> 00:23:41.686
TIME IS VEHICLES IN THE SINGLE

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:42.754
LARGEST.

00:23:42.821 --> 00:23:45.624
INCREASE IN EMISSIONS AND ENERGY

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.625
USE.

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.293
CAME FROM BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE SO

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.894
CENTER ALLEN TO REFER TO THIS

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.029
ALREADY BUT YOU KNOW DRIVING CAN

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.430
NOW BE A PRODUCTIVE TIME.

00:23:52.497 --> 00:23:53.632
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT BEHIND THE

00:23:53.698 --> 00:23:54.966
WHEEL COMMANDING THE VEHICLE

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:56.601
THEN LONGER COMMUTES FOR EGGS

00:23:56.668 --> 00:23:58.670
FOR INSTANCE -- MAY NOT BE THE

00:23:58.737 --> 00:24:00.405
BURDEN THAT THEY ONCE WERE -- IN

00:24:00.472 --> 00:24:01.540
THIS STUDY FOUND A VIS COULD

00:24:01.606 --> 00:24:03.842
INCREASE VEHICLE TRAVEL -- BY

00:24:03.909 --> 00:24:04.843
60%.

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.479
HOPEFULLY NOT LIKE THE GUY THAT

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:08.914
FELL ASLEEP IN.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.216
YEAH I AREAS THAT WAS ON HIGHWAY

00:24:11.283 --> 00:24:12.083
ONE I WANT TO SLEEP IN HONEST AS

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.319
LOW AS IT WAS GOING. SIXTY FIVE

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.488
MILES AN HOUR.

00:24:16.555 --> 00:24:19.090
THAT WAS NOT.

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.760
TO I WAS I DON'T NEED THAT. ONE

00:24:21.827 --> 00:24:23.562
OF THAT ONE OF THE SECOND RISKS

00:24:23.628 --> 00:24:25.030
IS THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT END UP

00:24:25.096 --> 00:24:26.631
SHARING RIDES IN SELF DRIVING

00:24:26.698 --> 00:24:28.500
VEHICLES IN THAT MORE ALL OVER

00:24:28.567 --> 00:24:29.868
THEY PULL PEOPLE FROM TRANSIT.

00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.469
WHICH AFTER ALL IS THE ORIGINAL

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.138
POOL DRIED.

00:24:33.205 --> 00:24:35.273
AND AND SO -- IS SIMILARLY

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.275
RESEARCH THERE AS ALSO LOOK AT

00:24:37.342 --> 00:24:39.077
HOW EVEN IF WE HAVE.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:40.478
SELF DRIVING CARS AND THEIR

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.380
ELECTRIC CARS IF WE ARE PULLING

00:24:42.447 --> 00:24:44.216
RIDES ARE STILL GONNA NOT BE

00:24:44.282 --> 00:24:46.151
REACHING OUR OUR CLIMATE GOALS.

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:47.185
AND A FINAL RISK THAT I'LL I'LL

00:24:47.252 --> 00:24:48.520
MENTION IS IS AV'S COULD

00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:49.588
EXACERBATE A PERPETUATE

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:51.223
INEQUITIES IN OUR COUNTRY

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.557
EXPECTATIONS SYSTEM SO.

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:53.859
YOU KNOW OUR OUR CURRENT CAR

00:24:53.925 --> 00:24:55.193
OWNERSHIP BASED TRANSPORTATION

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.095
SYSTEM DOES NOT SERVE ALL

00:24:57.162 --> 00:24:58.530
COMMUNITIES IN AN EQUITABLE WAY.

00:24:58.597 --> 00:24:59.164
AN EIGHTIES COULD IMPROVE

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.432
MOBILITY FOR COMMUNITIES

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:01.933
HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED BY

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.336
CURRENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM.

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:05.303
FOR THE CURRENT INEQUITIES COULD

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.038
BE EXACERBATED IN FOR EXAMPLE MY

00:25:07.105 --> 00:25:08.206
ORGANIZATION.

00:25:08.273 --> 00:25:09.674
RECENTLY MODEL SEVERAL SCENARIOS

00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:10.542
OF THE EFFECTS OF SELF DRIVING

00:25:10.609 --> 00:25:12.677
CARS IN THE WASHINGTON DC

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:13.778
METROPOLITAN AREA.

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:14.746
AND FOUND THE PEOPLE LIVING IN

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:15.614
LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.349
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

00:25:17.415 --> 00:25:18.984
EXPERIENCED FORTY SEVEN TIMES AS

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.552
MUCH CONGESTED DRIVING IS THE

00:25:20.619 --> 00:25:22.020
REGIONAL AVERAGE I IN THAT

00:25:22.087 --> 00:25:23.054
ANALYSIS.

00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.689
SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE I THINK THE

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.658
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL -- IN ONE

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:28.059
SENSE OF DATES THAT EIGHTIES MAY

00:25:28.126 --> 00:25:29.661
BE ABLE TO DRIVE THEMSELVES.

00:25:29.728 --> 00:25:30.829
BUT IT'S UP TO THE STATE

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:31.663
GOVERNMENT TO STEER THEM IN THE

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:33.865
RIGHT DIRECTION AND SB FIFTY

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:35.300
NINE TAKES IMPORTANT STEP IN

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.402
STRANGE TECHNOLOGY AS A SAMPLING.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:38.336
THANK YOU.

00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:40.138
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.039
BIGGER PLEASE.

00:25:41.106 --> 00:25:42.340
GOOD AFTERNOON A RARE AND

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:43.875
COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M RANGE YOU

00:25:43.942 --> 00:25:44.809
ARE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CAL

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:46.044
START WERE A TECHNOLOGY

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:47.312
CONSORTIUM THIS BEEN WORKING FOR

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.980
THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO

00:25:49.047 --> 00:25:50.348
ACCELERATE THE GROWTH OF CLEAN

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.651
TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY JOBS

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:53.852
INVESTMENT.

00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.420
AS YOU'VE HEARD WHETHER

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:56.354
CALIFORNIA'S READY OR NOT

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.156
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ARE A THESE

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.557
ARE HERE AND THEY'RE POISED TO

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:00.825
TRANSFORM THE STATE'S ENTIRE

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:02.694
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AND THE

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.029
WAY THEY CALIFORNIANS USE IT.

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:06.531
AND WE'RE ENCOURAGED BY A VIS.

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:07.599
THE TECHNOLOGY COULD SPEED THE

00:26:07.666 --> 00:26:09.134
GROWTH ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.702
THE COULD ENCOURAGE CARPOOLING

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:12.270
GIVE NEW TOOLS TO TRANSIT

00:26:12.337 --> 00:26:16.107
AGENCIES -- AND REDUCE ACCIDENTS

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:16.708
THERE MOSTLY CAUSED BY DRIVER

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:17.409
ERROR.

00:26:17.475 --> 00:26:18.143
BUT AS YOU HAVE ALSO HEARD SINCE

00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:19.878
IT IS A NEW TECHNOLOGY WE'RE

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.546
JUST GUESSING AT THE FUTURE AND

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:23.148
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS

00:26:23.214 --> 00:26:23.915
COMING.

00:26:23.982 --> 00:26:25.517
OTHER THAN THAT THE EFFECTS OF A

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:27.052
DRIVERLESS FUTURE WILL BE

00:26:27.118 --> 00:26:29.554
PROFOUND AND WILL BE COMPLEX.

DEVELOPMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:28:49.394 --> 00:28:49.861
THIS TECHNOLOGY IS STILL

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:51.563
DEVELOPING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:28:51.629 --> 00:28:52.764
THAT WE'RE NOT STIFLING.

00:28:52.831 --> 00:28:55.767
THIS INNOVATION -- AND THAT THE

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:57.068
BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:59.337
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:00.705
COMES WHEN THERE'S WIDESPREAD

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:02.273
DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.942
WE'RE NOT THERE YET AS MUCH AS I

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:05.710
WOULDLIKE TO NOT DRIVE A CAR

WE'VE GOT AWHILE TO GO BEFORE WE

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.180
GET THERE -- SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:10.882
SURE THAT ADDS CALIFORNIA LOOKS

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:12.517
DOWN THE LINE FOR THIS

00:29:12.584 --> 00:29:14.152
TECHNOLOGY IN THE WIDESPREAD

00:29:14.219 --> 00:29:15.353
DEPLOYMENT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.323
THERE WERE AVOIDING POLICY IS --

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.158
THAT COULD STIFLE THE INNOVATION

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:22.060
OF THIS TYPE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:29:22.127 --> 00:29:23.728
THAT WOULD MAKE IT SAFER THEY

00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.964
WOULD MEET YOU KNOW GET CLOSER

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.432
TO CALIFORNIA'S -- GREENHOUSE

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:29.400
SCHOOL GAS EMISSIONS GOALS AND

00:29:29.467 --> 00:29:30.201
ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS WE

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:31.803
DON'T WANT TO WE DON'T WANT TO

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:33.838
STIFLE THIS TECHNOLOGY -- BUT WE

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:34.839
WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH

00:29:34.906 --> 00:29:36.508
DOLLARS OFFICE TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:29:36.574 --> 00:29:38.009
WE HAVE THIS WORKING GROUP AND

00:29:38.076 --> 00:29:39.344
PROVIDE THEM SOME GUIDING

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.479
PRINCIPLES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE

00:29:41.546 --> 00:29:42.380
FOR WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY IS AT

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:43.681
TODAY AND WHERE WE WANTED TO BE

00:29:43.748 --> 00:29:47.652
IN THE FUTURE.

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.220
SO WE APPRECIATE THAT.

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:51.122
OF OTHERS SPEAKERS OPPOSING --

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:54.726
DISCUSSION -- COMMITTEE.

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:58.830
I A I A I A I HAD A QUESTION ON

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:00.865
THIS -- I NOTICED THAT THE MULTI

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:04.869
MODAL -- ASPECT IS GOING TO BE

00:30:04.936 --> 00:30:07.338
LOOKED INTO BY THE TASK FORCE --

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:08.373
I THINK THE AREA THAT I'M

00:30:08.439 --> 00:30:10.642
SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN IS.

00:30:10.708 --> 00:30:13.912
HOW THE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES?

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:17.515
COULD AID AND OR HOW THEY WOULD

00:30:17.582 --> 00:30:19.784
AFFECT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.653
SYSTEMS.

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.121
OF THE BUS SYSTEM WILL IT

00:30:23.188 --> 00:30:26.024
REPLACE THE BUSES.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:28.226
ON CERTAIN ROUTES.

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:30.361
A IS THERE A POTENTIAL FOR THAT

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:36.568
OR WILL IT ENHANCE -- OTHER --

00:30:36.634 --> 00:30:41.039
TRANSIT -- TRANSIT SYSTEMS LIKE

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:43.341
A HEAVY RAIL OR OTHER KINDS OF

00:30:43.408 --> 00:30:47.111
TRANSIT -- SO WILL REPLACE IN

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:49.113
OFFER REPLACES.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.250
BUSES -- ON CERTAIN ROUTES OR IN

00:30:52.317 --> 00:30:54.018
CERTAIN AREAS.

00:30:54.085 --> 00:30:55.887
OF HOW IT WAS IMPLICATIONS OF

00:30:55.954 --> 00:30:58.456
THAT IN TERMS OF LAND USE

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.825
PLANNING FOR EXAMPLE I MEAN THE

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:02.827
SIR ALLAN JOB I KNOW YOU PUT IT

00:31:02.894 --> 00:31:04.596
IS ONE OF THE GOALS.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:06.231
BUT I WANTED.

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:07.665
TO ASK YOU ABOUT -- DATA MISTER

00:31:07.732 --> 00:31:09.000
CHAIR THAT I MEAN THAT THAT'S A

00:31:09.067 --> 00:31:10.068
THAT'S A PERFECT.

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:12.604
EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF OF REALLY

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.972
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:17.775
THAT WE NEED TO BE SPENDING TIME

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:19.277
LOOKING AT AND THAT'S WHAT.

00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:20.511
WE'RE LOOKING TO TO EXAMINE HI

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:21.713
THERE JUST SO MANY UNCERTAINTIES

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.314
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ROLL OUT.

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:24.515
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH COULD

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:25.750
BE INCREDIBLY PROMISING I MEAN I

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:26.918
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WE WERE

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.086
I GUESS THE POINT HERE IS WE

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.554
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT.

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:31.656
IT REALLY DOES SERVE -- THE

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:34.225
NEEDS OF OUR SOCIETY AND AND AND

00:31:34.292 --> 00:31:35.593
AND BECOME SOMETHING IT BECOMES

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:37.095
IMMENSELY POPULAR AND SUCCESSFUL

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.830
AND SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY

00:31:38.896 --> 00:31:40.865
FRIENDLY AND AND ALL OF THE

00:31:40.932 --> 00:31:42.600
THINGS THAT IT PROMISES TO DO --

00:31:42.667 --> 00:31:44.836
AND AND NOT SEE THAT THAT

00:31:44.902 --> 00:31:46.971
QUESTION OF MULTI MODAL AND

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.172
WOULD WOULD BE ACTUALLY ONE OF

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.941
THE ONE OF THE CENTRAL QUESTIONS

00:31:50.008 --> 00:31:52.110
BEING ASKED BY -- BY THE BY THE

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:55.079
OFFICE -- SO. TO THE EXPERTS

00:31:55.146 --> 00:31:56.814
HAVE ANY OPINION ABOUT THE DO

00:31:56.881 --> 00:31:58.683
YOU THINK IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.153
ON BUS ROUND SERVER -- TRANSIT

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.354
IN SOME WAY HOW WOULD IT AFFECT

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:05.223
TRANSIT.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.859
SYSTEMS DAVIS WELL IT YOU KNOW-IT'S NOT CONCLUSIVE AT THIS

00:32:07.925 --> 00:32:08.826
POINT BUT I THINK THE YOU KNOW

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.061
THE RESEARCH IS OUT THERE --

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:11.796
RAISES THE EXACT SAME CONCERNS

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:12.964
THAT YOU HAVE AND THEN THERE'S

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.332
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A THAT

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:17.068
EITHER OUTCOME -- IS POSSIBLE

00:32:17.135 --> 00:32:18.603
AND AND PROBABLY WILL TAKE IT'LL

00:32:18.670 --> 00:32:20.271
TAKE MORE CONSIDERATION OF WHAT

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:21.439
WOULD BE THE POLICY LEVERS AND

00:32:21.506 --> 00:32:23.141
TOOLS THAT STATE AND REGIONAL

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.642
GOVERNMENTS MIGHT HAVE. TO

00:32:24.709 --> 00:32:26.544
ENSURE THE BEST OUTCOME THERE

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:29.580
WILL WE HAVE HEALTHY TRANSIT --

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:32.350
THAT'S COMPLIMENTING THE USE OF

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.352
OF SELF DRIVING CARS -- YOU KNOW

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:39.557
PART OF THE ESPY ONE WAS TO DO --

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:42.794
CERRONE WAS TO DO -- RESEARCH WE

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.899
pYEAR AND SB ONE FOR RESEARCH.

00:32:47.965 --> 00:32:49.934
IF WE ASK THE UNIVERSITY --

00:32:50.001 --> 00:32:52.470
RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS TO CENSOR

00:32:52.537 --> 00:32:53.938
TASK FORCE WOULD THAT BE

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:55.440
IMMENSELY HELPFUL AND I AND I

00:32:55.506 --> 00:32:57.608
LOVE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE UC

00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:58.009

00:32:58.076 --> 00:32:59.077
TRANSPORTATION STUDIES.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:00.712
WORKS ON THIS YET EVEN LOOKING

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:01.913
THEIR VERY INTO THIS BILL AND

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:02.947
ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:04.615
PROMISE THAT COULD BRING BUT

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:05.483
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT QUESTION

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:07.585
AND WE WILL BRING THE PROFESSORS

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:08.686
FROM THERE YOU KNOW.

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:11.723
DEAR AND HAVE YOU HAVE A SOUL

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:12.757
DIALOGUE WITH THEM IN.

DOMINANT OF OF VEHICLE ON OUR

ROADS AND WE WANT TO BE I THINK

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.615
THE STATE WANTS TO BE PREPARED

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:12.116
RATHER THAN GETTING A SITUATION

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.352

REGULATE.

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:21.726
THAT WE THINK IN ADVANCE WHAT

00:34:21.793 --> 00:34:23.361
ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

00:34:23.428 --> 00:34:24.695
MIGHT BE ANTICIPATED BESIDES

00:34:24.762 --> 00:34:25.897

00:34:25.963 --> 00:34:27.832
THAT WE SHOULD BE ADDRESSING AS

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.100
THESE AT ARMS VEHICLES ROLL OUT

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:34.705

00:34:46.217 --> 00:34:47.885
THE TASK FORCE OF THE STUDY

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:49.720

ENFORCEMENT.

00:34:52.957 --> 00:34:54.158
AND I THINK SAFETY -- IS THERE

00:34:54.225 --> 00:34:56.294
IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.562
THE AUTOMATION.

00:34:57.628 --> 00:35:01.399
SO I WOULD HOPE YOU'D CONSIDER --

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:02.400
SOMEONE FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:04.502
PARTICULAR THE HIGHWAY PATROL IT

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:06.304
WAS MENTIONED IN OUR ANALYSIS AS

00:35:06.370 --> 00:35:08.539
A THIS WOULD BE A STEP IN THE

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:11.576
RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:35:11.642 --> 00:35:13.611
YEAH I I THINK YOU'RE -- I THINK

00:35:13.678 --> 00:35:15.213
JUST IT THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:17.048
AND ANY AYE AND I'M ABSOLUTELY

00:35:17.114 --> 00:35:19.016

JUST MEAN THAT IN THE WAY THAT A

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:21.219
LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT AND THEN

00:35:21.285 --> 00:35:22.286
THEY DON'T MEAN IT.

THINK.

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.727
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA THE THE

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.095
REASON WHY IT WASN'T IN

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:34.365
ORIGINALLY IS THAT THIS IS.

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:37.668
NOT -- DID DID THERE THE THE WE

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:38.970
WERE TRYING TO FILL THERE'S BEEN

00:35:39.036 --> 00:35:40.304
A LOT OF WORK ON THE SAFETY SIDE.

BASICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.344
INVOLVING A VISA IS NOT REALLY

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.378
BEEN OUT OF A LOOK AT AND I'LL

00:35:47.445 --> 00:35:48.312
BE SAD.

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:49.647
IF THE THE INCLUDING LOT FORCE

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:51.315
IS NOT JUST A FIFTIES RIGHT ALSO

00:35:51.382 --> 00:35:53.417
ABOUT TRAFFIC FLOW IT'S ABOUT.

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:56.320
CULPABILITY LIABILITY -- TICKETS

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:57.822
YOU KNOW I MEAN ALL THAT SO I I

00:35:57.889 --> 00:35:59.657
AM TALKING MYSELF INTO I THINK

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:00.958
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

00:36:01.025 --> 00:36:04.028

WHICH INCLUDES THE CH WE DO SO

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.434
THE LEADER OF THAT ARE THAT

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:11.669
MIGHT BE THE PLACE TO DO IT.

00:36:11.736 --> 00:36:13.905
BUT I I I THINK WE WOULD BE I

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:14.505
THINK WILL BE A GOOD IDEA TO

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:15.907
HAVE SINCE I I'D SAY THAT

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:16.908

00:51:27.517 --> 00:51:28.585
WE MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:29.686
ONE OF THOSE REGIONAL DECISIONS

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:31.021
THAT ARE BEING MADE IN THOSE

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:31.988
LOCAL DECISIONS THAT ARE BEING

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:33.490
MADE BUT AS A TRANSPORTATION

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:35.592
AGENCY WE DON'T MAKE THOSE LAND

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.860
USE DECISIONS.

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:38.128
THOSE ARE NOT MADE BY

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.429
TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES.

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.031
THAT WILL OUR JOB IS TO MAKE

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:42.566
SURE WE GIVE FULL MOBILITY

00:51:42.632 --> 00:51:44.034
OPTIONS FOR ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.069
OF ORANGE COUNTY NOT JUST THOSE

00:51:46.136 --> 00:51:47.270
THAT LIVE IN CERTAIN POCKETS SO

00:51:47.337 --> 00:51:49.473
THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE.

00:51:49.539 --> 00:51:50.574
I THINK GLOBALLY WITH THIS.

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.541
AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO JUST

00:51:51.608 --> 00:51:53.076
MENTION -- WE TALKED ABOUT THIS

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:54.644
A LITTLE BIT AND MAYBE WE COULD

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:55.612
WORK ON THIS GOING FORWARD AND

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:58.348
THAT IS THE BILL DOES -- DISCUSS

00:51:58.415 --> 00:52:01.351
AND AND RELY ON V. M. T. AS A AS

00:52:01.418 --> 00:52:03.753
A SIGNIFICANT -- INDICATOR OF

00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.422
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS WE

00:52:05.489 --> 00:52:06.456
DON'T THINK THAT'S A GREAT

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:08.592
BAROMETER OF OF WHETHER OR NOT

00:52:08.658 --> 00:52:10.527
WE'RE MEETING OUR GOALS WE HAVE

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:11.995
A PROJECT IN ORANGE COUNTY THAT

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:13.063
WERE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF ITS ON

00:52:13.129 --> 00:52:15.131
THE OC STREET CARTS A BRAND NEW

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.566
TRANSIT SYSTEM NO ONE ELSE IS

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:17.501
BUILDING NEW TRANSIT.

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.603
OR BUILDING A BRAND NEW TRANSIT

00:52:19.669 --> 00:52:21.204
SYSTEM IT'S A ONE OF THE MOST --

00:52:21.271 --> 00:52:23.106
THE DENSEST POPULATED AREAS OF

00:52:23.173 --> 00:52:25.175
THE STATE -- IN THE NATION IN

00:52:25.242 --> 00:52:28.211
SANTA ANA -- AND TECHNICALLY IT

00:52:28.278 --> 00:52:30.280
WOULD AT LEAST NARROWLY INCREASE

00:52:30.347 --> 00:52:31.815
V. M T. BECAUSE IT RE ROUTE

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.450
TRAFFIC AND WE HAVE PEOPLE

00:52:33.517 --> 00:52:34.784
TRAVELING TO THE END POINTS.

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:37.387
BY ALL ALL MEASURES THIS IS THAT

00:52:37.454 --> 00:52:38.455
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT I THINK

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:41.491
THAT -- WE ALL WOULD AGREE IS IS

00:52:41.558 --> 00:52:43.326

THE STEP COMPONENT -- THAT WAS

00:53:12.222 --> 00:53:13.690

OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.910

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:35.779
CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS NUMBER

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:36.980
ONE WE WILL ME BACK UP WE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:39.249
DEFINITELY SHARE THE GOAL OF

00:53:39.316 --> 00:53:39.749
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:41.318
EMISSIONS.

00:53:41.384 --> 00:53:42.485
THE COUNTIES THAT I REPRESENT TO

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:44.354
HAVE SALES TAX MEASURES TO TRY

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:46.590
TO PROVIDE MULTI MODAL OPTIONS

00:53:46.656 --> 00:53:48.358
IN ORDER TO WIN PEOPLE OFF OF

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.926
THEIR DEPENDENCE ON THE VEHICLE --

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.227
THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE HOWEVER

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.562
THOUGH IS THAT WE DO NEED TO

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.064
IMPROVE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:54.731
SO.

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.765
WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE

00:53:55.832 --> 00:53:58.668
HAPPEN IS FOR SAFETY CONGESTION

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.270
MANAGEMENT PROJECTS TO ALSO FALL

00:54:00.337 --> 00:54:01.605
BY THE WAYSIDE?

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.073
AND SO WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.241
UPROOTED APPROACHES FOCUSING ON

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:06.509
WHERE THOSE PEOPLE TRAVELING TO

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:07.711

00:54:07.777 --> 00:54:09.512
CENTERS AND SO FOR FOLKS THAT

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:15.919
WHERE THE JOBS ARE IN SO MAYBE

00:54:15.986 --> 00:54:17.887
FOCUSING ON INCENTIVES TO

GAS EMISSIONS.

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:25.595
AND THEN MAKING MORE INVESTMENTS

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:27.130
AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE WITH

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:28.832
PASSENGER RAIL SERVICE COULD BE

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:30.500

OKAY -- OKAY -- SO WE I I I AM

00:55:25.822 --> 00:55:26.890
RECOMMENDING THIS BILL WITH THE

00:55:26.956 --> 00:55:27.891
AMENDMENTS AUTHORED THREE TO THE

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.526
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THAT

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:31.594
ENTAILS THE THE ISSUE OF THE

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:36.700
STATE OF BEING THE FOR THEM --

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.802
SIR -- AS WE HAVE SOME TECHNICAL

00:55:38.868 --> 00:55:40.870

WE AGREE TO AND I WANT TO KNOW

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:44.541
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:48.511
COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- I

00:55:48.578 --> 00:55:51.548
SEE NO ANSWER ON THE ONE EIGHT

00:55:51.614 --> 00:55:52.949
ONE OF THINGS I THINK IS THE

00:55:53.016 --> 00:55:54.551
METROPOLITAN PLANNING

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:59.055
ORGANIZATIONS WERE DESIGNED --

00:55:59.122 --> 00:56:01.224
TO WORK WITH THE AIR REGIONAL

00:56:01.291 --> 00:56:04.394
AIR QUALITY BOARDS TO REDUCE

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.463
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:07.931
AND THEN WE HAVE THE STATE

00:56:07.997 --> 00:56:08.231
[inaudible]

00:56:08.298 --> 00:56:10.633
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.236
SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO WORK WITH --

00:56:13.303 --> 00:56:16.139
STATE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:18.942
AND DEVICE TRANSPORTATION PLANS

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:22.112
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS --

00:56:22.178 --> 00:56:26.549
BUT IN THE DO THAT NAY THEY WORK

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:27.917
TOGETHER ON THE PLANNING PART

00:56:27.984 --> 00:56:29.352
BUT THEY DON'T.

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:31.721
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT WE PLAN

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:33.022
AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ARE

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.357
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS BECAUSE OF

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:35.558
THE ECONOMY.

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:37.227
AND MORE JOBS COME IN ALL THE

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.528
SUDDEN THERE'S MORE.

00:56:38.595 --> 00:56:39.963
DRIVE BEING OTHERS MORE

00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:42.966
POLLUTION LESS TRANSIT USAGE.

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:47.604
A LOT OF FACTORS INFLUENCE --

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.305
YOUR ARE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.441
EMISSIONS AND TRANSPORTATION

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:54.677
SECTOR -- SO I THINK I THINK WE

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:57.981
HAVE TO SET OURSELVES AND LOOK

00:56:58.047 --> 00:57:00.517
WHAT COULD HAVE THE THE GREATEST

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:02.418
IMPACT THE BIGGEST BANG FOR YOUR

00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:05.054
BUCK OR BIGGEST RETURN ON YOUR

00:57:05.121 --> 00:57:06.055
INVESTMENT.

00:57:06.122 --> 00:57:09.359
IN EACH AREA EACH REGION. TO

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.795
WHAT COULD -- REDUCE GREENHOUSE

00:57:11.861 --> 00:57:13.830
GAS EMISSIONS.

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:16.866
AND GET THE METROPOLITAN

00:57:16.933 --> 00:57:19.035
PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS. TO

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:21.271
COMMIT TO THAT.

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:23.239
AND IT AS YOU KNOW I I WAS ON

00:57:23.306 --> 00:57:25.675
THOUGH THE BAY AREA METROPOLITAN

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:26.976
PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THE

00:57:27.043 --> 00:57:29.712
SERVER DODD AND OTHERS AND OTHER

00:57:29.779 --> 00:57:30.747
SENATORS.

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:33.683
SIR WINNER -- EYES SERVED AS

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.785
CHAIR AND I SERVED ON THERE FOR

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:36.853
TWENTY ONE YEARS.

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.722
AND I THINK THE THE DISCONNECT

00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:42.058
IS BETWEEN THE PLANNING.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.493
VERSUS THE FUNDING AND THE

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.361
ACTION PART [inaudible]

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.831
SO.

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.666
THE PLANNING IS ALL GOOD BUT

00:57:49.732 --> 00:57:50.800
THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO

00:57:50.867 --> 00:57:52.001
IMPLEMENT THE PLANS THAT

00:57:52.068 --> 00:57:53.570
ACTUALLY REDUCE TO GREENHOUSE

00:57:53.636 --> 00:57:54.838
GAS EMISSIONS [inaudible]

00:57:54.904 --> 00:57:58.007
SO -- MY HOPE IS THAT WE CAN

00:57:58.074 --> 00:57:59.576
DEVISE.

00:57:59.642 --> 00:58:02.045
WITH THE WORK YOU'RE DOING.

00:58:02.111 --> 00:58:03.880
SOME KIND OF WAY OF CONNECTING

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.381
THE TWO BETTER SO WE CAN.

00:58:05.448 --> 00:58:07.217
GET RESULTS PEOPLE WANT RESULTS

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:08.451
THEY WANT TO THEY WANT TO SEE

00:58:08.518 --> 00:58:09.919
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:58:09.986 --> 00:58:11.354
REDUCED.

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.256
SO WE HAVE TO HAVE RESULTS SO.

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.557
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:58:14.624 --> 00:58:15.859
COMMENTS ON THAT -- BUT BE

01:16:02.024 --> 01:16:03.091
PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCES THAT

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.493
WE'VE HEARD BUT I THINK THE MOST

EIGHT YEARS.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.467
THAT'S PRECISELY WHY THE PILOT

MERITS OF THIS PROGRAM.

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:31.586
I THINK IT'S ONLY APPROPRIATE

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:33.689
THAT WE LET THE MERITS OF THIS

01:16:33.755 --> 01:16:34.923

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.511
THE FACT THAT CHILDREN TODAY

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.079
CONTINUE TO BE STRUCK BY DRIVERS

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:19.915
WHO DO NOT FOLLOW THE LAW

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:20.982

THIS BILL IS AN AWFULLY

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:13.735
IMPORTANT BILL BUT IT'S A TOUGH --

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.303
ONE WE OF ADDED FOR OVER THE

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:17.239

IMPORTANCE OF STOPPING BEHIND

THE BOSS IN IN FRONT OF THE BUS.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.486
YET NOW WE'RE UP TO THREE POINT

01:21:31.553 --> 01:21:34.122
SEVEN MILLION VIOLATIONS A YEAR

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:36.424
AND THESE ARE NOT CARS CREEPING

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:38.026
BY THE BUS THESE ARE.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:39.995
THESE ARE CARS SPEEDING BY A

01:21:40.061 --> 01:21:42.464
SCHOOL BUS -- WE HAD THERE'S A

01:21:42.530 --> 01:21:44.399
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW MANY

TIMES CHILDREN ARE HIT IN OUR

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:47.769
STATE BUT WE HAD WENT BACK AND

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.104
HAD THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.740
BERKELEY GO INTO OUR OWN YOU SEE

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:52.340
H. P..

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.142
SWEATERS COLLISION DATA WE

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.013
FIVE TIMES IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:21:58.079 --> 01:22:00.115
THAT CHILDREN HAVE BEEN HIT.

01:22:00.181 --> 01:22:02.083
SO SOME WILL FATAL SEVERAL

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.051
SERIOUS BUT THERE'S A

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:04.719
DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THAT BUT BUT

01:22:04.786 --> 01:22:07.022
MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE SIX

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:07.622
HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN AND

01:22:07.689 --> 01:22:08.657
THESE ARE CHILDREN FROM

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.792
PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:11.893
NEIGHBORHOODS.

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:13.528
USING THE BUS SYSTEM BECAUSE OUR

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:15.530
PARENTS ARE WORKING TO GO TO

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:20.502
SCHOOL AND YET WE ARE ALLOWING

01:22:20.568 --> 01:22:22.704
THREE POINT.

01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:23.872
SEVEN DODD MILLION DRIVERS TO

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:24.839
SPEED BY THEIR BOSSES IT'S WERE

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.708
CREATING A SITUATION WHERE IT IS

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.210
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A STOP LAW.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:30.612
ON OUR BOOKS WE NEED TO FIGURE

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.247
OUT OKAY WHAT ELSE DO WE NEED TO

01:22:32.314 --> 01:22:34.382
DO TO PROTECT THESE CHILDREN

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.051
THIS IS A SERIOUS THIS IS A

01:22:36.117 --> 01:22:37.085
SERIOUS PROBLEM.

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.186
SO WE'RE SPONSORING THIS

01:22:38.253 --> 01:22:40.355
LEGISLATION AFTER LOOKING AT

01:22:40.422 --> 01:22:42.023
SIXTEEN OTHER STATES WERE TAKING

01:22:42.090 --> 01:22:43.491
THE VERY BEST PRACTICES AND

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:45.126
PIECES OF THE VERY BEST

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.728
PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES. TO

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.431
PUT INTO OUR VEHICLE CODE THE

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.299
STRUCTURE THAT COSTS US

01:22:51.366 --> 01:22:52.701
CALIFORNIA'S WOULD LIKE TO SEE

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:54.536
IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT DECIDES ON

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:56.004
ITS OWN THAT IT WANTS TO TRY TO

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:58.273
USE THIS TO PROTECT ITS CHILDREN.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.874
THIS DOES NOT REQUIRED TO DO IT

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.910
BUT IT DOES GET US GOING DOWN

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.244
THE ROAD OF WHAT DOES IT LOOK

01:23:03.311 --> 01:23:05.080
LIKE WHAT ARE THE PRIVACY RIGHTS

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.681
WHAT ARE THE RIGHTS OF THAT

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:07.849
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:09.684
OF THE DRIVERS OF THE STUDENTS --

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:11.653
HOW DO WE PAY FOR IT ALL THAT IS

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.588
BUILT INTO THIS BUT YOU CAN'T

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.724
SHARE THIS DATA WITH ANYBODY BUT

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:17.692
THE TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT DIVISION

01:23:17.759 --> 01:23:19.127
IN THAT JURISDICTION?

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.862
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL IN

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:23.131
THIS BILL THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT

01:23:23.198 --> 01:23:25.066
MORE WE JUST TOOK SOME MORE --

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:26.835
GOOD AMENDMENTS ABOUT NOT

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:29.404
INCENTIVIZING ANY OF THE SCHOOL

01:23:29.471 --> 01:23:30.739
DISTRICTS TO WRITE A INCENTIVE

01:23:30.805 --> 01:23:34.476
IS ATION CONTRACT WITH THE

01:23:34.542 --> 01:23:35.443
VENDOR.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.111
BUT WE'RE FACED WITH SIX HUNDRED

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:37.946
THOUSAND KIDS.

01:23:38.012 --> 01:23:39.581
THAT WE'RE SETTING A MOP. TO BE

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:41.149
NERVOUS AND SCARED SIMPLE

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:41.883
BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THEIR

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.318
SCHOOL BUSES AND THEY ARE

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:45.754
GETTING HIT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:47.889
THOUSANDS OF THEM DON'T GET HERE

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.891
BUT THEY HAVE TO DODGE THE CARS

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:51.593
AND THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND I THINK

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.461
IS A STATE WE CAN DO BETTER AND

01:23:53.528 --> 01:23:55.296
THIS IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD FOR

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.765
FRAMING UP.

01:23:56.831 --> 01:23:58.800
ANOTHER WAY OF DOING IT SIXTEEN

01:23:58.867 --> 01:24:00.235
STATES A MOVE FORWARD THEY'RE

01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:02.303
GETTING A 40% AND A 50%

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:03.872
REDUCTION IN THEIR IN THEIR

01:24:03.938 --> 01:24:05.974
VIOLATIONS AND I GO THROUGH THAT

01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:07.709
DETAIL IF YOU WANT TO ASK BUT

01:24:07.776 --> 01:24:09.177

OUT TO MORE COMMITTEES TO GO

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:14.616
THROUGH I'M SURE THEY'LL BE MORE

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.418
MORE AMENDMENTS TO TIGHTEN UP

01:24:16.484 --> 01:24:17.452
HOW THIS WORKS FOR US IN

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.521
CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN SCHOOLS DO

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:22.924
NOT WE'RE NOT TELLING THEM THEY

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.292
HAVE TO USE THIS.

YEAH BUT ON ANYWAY SO THANK YOU.

01:24:27.061 --> 01:24:28.129

EMPLOYEE DISCRIMINATION -- AS

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.148
WAS.

01:24:47.215 --> 01:24:50.018
ILLUSTRATED IN THE ANALYSIS OUR

01:24:50.084 --> 01:24:51.786

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:08.736
SERIOUSLY.

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.077
I KNOW THAT THIS BODY DOES NOT

01:25:16.144 --> 01:25:16.678
LEGISLATE BY ANECDOTE BUT I

01:25:16.744 --> 01:25:17.579
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:19.614
HELP INFORM THE CONVERSATION IF

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:21.749

01:25:25.787 --> 01:25:28.022
SCHOOL ALL RIGHT WHEN THE SCHOOL

01:25:34.529 --> 01:25:36.598
THERE IS A CROSSING GUARD THERE

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:39.000
IN YELLOW BLAZER AND STOP SIGN

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:41.169

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:45.039
CANNOT COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES.

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:46.508
SOMEONE HAS DISOBEYED THE LAW

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.810

01:25:48.877 --> 01:25:51.112

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.719
INCREASED SAFETY FOR THOSE KIDS

01:25:57.785 --> 01:25:59.120

CONCERNS RELATED TO THIS BILL.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.448
ANY TIME AT THE GOVERNMENT

IMPLEMENTS A NEW SYSTEM FOR THE

01:27:02.383 --> 01:27:04.419
AUTOMATED COLLECTION OF LARGE

AMOUNTS OF DATA.

01:27:05.787 --> 01:27:07.655
SUCH AS THE USE OF RED LIGHT

CAMERAS OR THE AUTOMATED SCHOOL

01:27:10.024 --> 01:27:12.594
BUS VIDEO ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS.

01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:14.062
THAT WOULD BE AUTHORIZED BY THIS

01:27:14.128 --> 01:27:14.963
BILL.

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:16.864
THERE IS A DANGER TO INDIVIDUAL

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.433
PRIVACY.

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:20.335
AND WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:30.345
PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT THE

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:32.080
MISUSE OF THE INFORMATION

01:27:32.146 --> 01:27:35.483
GATHERED. FOR EXAMPLE SB THREE

01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:36.284

CAPTURED BY A SCHOOL BUS CAMERA

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:48.863
THAT CAN THEN BE USED TO TRACK

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.698
THE LOCATIONS OF VEHICLES AND

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.300
THE PEOPLE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:53.568
VEHICLES.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:55.203
NOR DOES THE BILL PROHIBIT THE

01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:57.205
SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM SHARING THE

01:27:57.271 --> 01:27:58.673

THE VENDORS THEY CONTRACT WITH

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.910
ARE SUBJECT TO THAT RESTRICTION.

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.512
THE DANGERS OF COLLECTING THE

01:28:04.579 --> 01:28:06.848
DATA ARE HEIGHTENED BY THE

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.449
NINETY DAY RETENTION PERIOD FOR

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.517

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:11.786
FAR LONGER THAN IS NECESSARY FOR

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:14.155
THE PURPOSE OF ENFORCING THE LAW.

01:28:14.222 --> 01:28:15.790
AND LIKE I SAID WE AGAIN

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:17.291
RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THAT

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.060
THE VERY IMPORTANT GOALS OF THIS

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:21.863
LEGISLATION BUT WE UNFORTUNATELY

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.665
MUST OPPOSE IT BASED ON THESE

01:28:23.731 --> 01:28:27.602
PRIVACY CONCERNS THANK YOU.

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:29.404

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:40.715
OF OKAY -- SIR RAFEAL QUESTION.

01:28:40.782 --> 01:28:41.182

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:42.016
THERE STONE.

01:28:42.083 --> 01:28:44.452
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M --

01:28:44.519 --> 01:28:46.154
CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:28:46.220 --> 01:28:47.355
CONCEPT I'M.

01:28:47.422 --> 01:28:49.123
FRANKLY FRIGHTENED BY THE NUMBER

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.491
OF PEOPLE WHO.

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:53.494
DISREGARD RED LIGHTS BOTH IN.

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:56.164
CITIES AND EARLIER AROUND THE

01:28:56.230 --> 01:28:57.365
SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION VEHICLES

01:28:57.432 --> 01:29:00.501
AND IN MY EXPERIENCE I'VE BEEN A

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:01.769
FEW CITIES IN MY FAIRLY LONG

01:29:01.836 --> 01:29:03.471
LIFE AND FRANKLY THIS ONCE THE

01:29:03.538 --> 01:29:05.406
WORST.

01:29:05.473 --> 01:29:07.141
BUT LET ME ASK A QUESTION ABOUT

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:09.010
THE PROCESS FOR DEALING WITH THE

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:11.312
VIDEO CAPTURES SO.

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.281
I'M FAMILIAR WITH VIDEO -- AND

01:29:13.347 --> 01:29:15.283
PHOTOS THAT ARE TAKEN HAVE BEEN

01:29:15.349 --> 01:29:16.818
TAKEN BY THE CITY RED LIGHT

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.186
CAMERAS.

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.154
AND THE FIDELITY IS PRETTY GOOD.

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:21.956
AND THE PHOTOS ARE OF BOTH THE

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:22.924
VEHICLE AND THE DRIVER IN THE

01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:24.859
VEHICLE.

01:29:24.926 --> 01:29:26.227
SO.

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:27.095
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.362
AMENDMENTS CHANGED TO PUT A NOTE

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:30.498
IN THE ANALYSIS IN THIS

01:29:30.565 --> 01:29:32.233
PARTICULAR CASE THE VIDEO

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.601
CAPTURE IS GOING TO BE OF THE

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:36.504
VEHICLE NONE OF THE PASSENGERS

01:29:36.571 --> 01:29:39.240
OR THE DRIVERS AT THE CASE.

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:40.908
YEAH THESE THESE CATS THESE

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.210
CAMERAS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:44.078
THAN THE INTERSECTION CAMPUSES

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:47.281
ALSO IS A CIVIL CITATION --

01:29:47.348 --> 01:29:48.983
THAT'S BEING -- CONTEMPLATED IN

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.885
THE BILL AND THE CIVIL CITATION

01:29:50.952 --> 01:29:53.087
IS DIFFERENT IT IS -- CITATION

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:55.056
AGAINST THE VEHICLE SO LIKE YOU

01:29:55.123 --> 01:29:56.991
OTHER CITATIONS LIKE A PARKING

01:29:57.058 --> 01:29:58.192
TICKET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:01.662
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSIGN SO

01:30:01.729 --> 01:30:04.499
IF YOU GET A CIVIL CITATION ON

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.200
YOU YOU SPEED PAST THE BUS

01:30:06.267 --> 01:30:07.835
CAMERA TAKES THE PHOTOGRAPH OF

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.203
THE VEHICLE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.738
DETERMINES AL THAT WAS A

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.240
VIOLATION THEY SEND YOU A

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.174
CITATION.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:14.041
HE SAID WELL THAT WAS MY

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:15.409
NEIGHBOR DRIVING MY CAR THAT DAY

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:17.612
OR THAT WAS MY SON YOU ARE

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:19.547
ALLOWED TO ASSIGN AND THE LAW

01:30:19.614 --> 01:30:21.249
ENFORCEMENT MUST BY CURRENT

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:22.917
STATUTE IN CODE.

01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.485
THEY MUST RE ASSIGN THE TICKET

01:30:24.552 --> 01:30:27.054
OR THE CITATION OVER -- THE IT

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.790
IS NOT THE SAME AS IF A TRAFFIC

01:30:28.856 --> 01:30:30.558
OFFICER OR RED LIGHT CAMERA

01:30:30.625 --> 01:30:32.026
CAUGHT YOU IN AN INTERSECTION

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.628
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS IF A LAW

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:35.763
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER PULLS YOU

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:41.669

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:43.271
BALLGAME.

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.872
SO DO THE THE AMENDMENTS

CONTEMPLATE.

CAPTURE.

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:51.913
DOES THAT MEAN THE AGENCY HAS

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:53.314
THE DISCRETION TO DEEM A

01:30:53.381 --> 01:30:55.149
VIOLATION NOT TO HAVE OCCURRED

01:30:55.216 --> 01:30:56.083
UNDER THE VEHICLE CODE.

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:57.685

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:05.560
IMPROPER WAY.

01:31:05.626 --> 01:31:07.228
WHAT'S THE TIME LINE TO A DUTY

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.130
ASSIGNMENT.

01:31:09.197 --> 01:31:11.199
RIGHT NOW IN THE BILL THEY HAVE

01:31:11.265 --> 01:31:13.868
NINETY DAYS TO RETAIN THE VIDEO --

01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:15.469
ACLU IS ASKING FOR THAT TO BE

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.904
SHORTER BECAUSE AND WE AGREE

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:18.105
WITH THEM WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:19.674
THAT THIS IS ONLY USE FOR

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:22.143
TRAFFIC VIA THIS SPECIFIC.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.645

AUTHOR ABOUT AMENDING THE BILL

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.717

TIME FRAME HOUSE TO BE MUCH

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:33.054

TO GET THROUGH THOSE THAT THAT

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:46.534
INFORMATION AND THAT HAS TO BE

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:47.802
TIGHTENED UP IN THE BILL.

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.704
ABOUT -- THAT IT CAN'T BE SHARED

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.939

01:31:52.006 --> 01:31:53.441
ENTITY THAT IS DOING THE

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:56.110
DETERMINATION IN THAT

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.045
JURISDICTION ONLY -- SO THE

01:31:58.112 --> 01:32:00.047
THERE IS SOME WORK TO DO ON

01:32:00.114 --> 01:32:01.082
SHORTENING THE TIME FRAME BUT

01:32:01.148 --> 01:32:03.217
RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A NINETY

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:05.620
DAY -- ACLU IS SAYING THAT'S TOO

01:32:05.686 --> 01:32:07.989
LONG BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF TIME

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:09.390
THAT VIDEO SITS THERE.

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.525
SOMEBODY COULD DO SOME NEFARIOUS

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:12.627
THINGS WITH IT.

01:32:12.693 --> 01:32:14.362
WE AGREE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE

01:32:14.428 --> 01:32:16.564
DOING IT WE DON'T AGREE THAT

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:18.799
THAT EVERY TIME THERE IS OF OF

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.501
VIDEO SYSTEM THAT THERE'S

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:22.270
SOMEBODY TRYING TO USE IT FOR

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.372
SOMETHING -- TO SHARE IT WITH

01:32:24.438 --> 01:32:26.274
SOMETHING WRONG BUT WE THINK

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:28.209
THAT WE DO NEED TO TAKE -- AND

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:30.044
WE HAVE A JUDICIAL COMMITTEE

01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:31.812
COMING -- HEARING COMING UP TO

01:32:31.879 --> 01:32:33.114
TAKE A MEMBERS FURTHER

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.815
AMENDMENTS REDRESS THERE WERE

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.150
FOUR ISSUES AT A CO YOU PUT IT

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:37.818
ON AND WE HAVE AMENDMENTS FOR

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:39.620
ALL FOUR OF THEM.

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:41.555
AND IT WILL BE MEETING WITH THEM

01:32:41.622 --> 01:32:42.657
BUT I MEAN I WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:45.026
SO THIS IS IF THIS IS A CIVIL

01:32:45.092 --> 01:32:46.694
VIOLATION BUT IF YOU COMMITTED.

01:32:46.761 --> 01:32:48.162

DRIVER'S RECORD.

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:38.312
AS WITH MANY TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.448
THE COURT MAY PERMIT A VIOLATOR

01:33:40.514 --> 01:33:43.284

SCHOOL FOR A FIRST OFFENSE.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:45.820
AND THEN IT GOES ON TO TALK

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:46.620
ABOUT.

01:33:46.687 --> 01:33:48.255

01:33:56.731 --> 01:33:58.099
CURRENTLY THE PROCESS IS NOT

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.400
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE PROCESS

01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:01.235

FOOTAGE TO DETERMINE WHETHER A

01:34:08.943 --> 01:34:10.144
VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED.

01:34:10.211 --> 01:34:11.245

IT'S NOT ME IT'S HIM.

01:34:28.629 --> 01:34:29.897

01:34:29.964 --> 01:34:32.033
RESPONSIBILITY AND PRESUMABLY A

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:34.602

THROUGH RED LIGHTS BLATANTLY I

01:38:14.788 --> 01:38:15.356

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:16.390
REMEMBER.

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:16.957
SITTING IN A CITY COUNCIL

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.692

WAS DOING THAT.

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:31.005
THEY WILL THREE HUNDRED

01:38:31.071 --> 01:38:32.973
CITATIONS [inaudible]

01:38:33.040 --> 01:38:36.277
THREE HUNDRED AND THE STOPLIGHT

ABUSE WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY SO --

01:38:39.913 --> 01:38:41.181
INCREASE ENFORCEMENT I THINK

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:41.815
IT'S SOMETHING IS NECESSARY AND

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:43.884
THEN -- SOME MUNICIPALITIES IN

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:45.452
RIVERSIDE COUNTY ORKS FOR

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:46.754
AMENDING WITH UP WITH CAMERAS

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:47.721
AND I'LL TELL YOU.

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:49.323
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT EVOKED

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.524
A LOT OF ANGER WITH OUR

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:53.627
CONSTITUENTS IT WAS A STOP LIGHT

01:38:53.694 --> 01:38:55.796
CAMERAS -- THEY CAME TO OUR

01:38:55.863 --> 01:38:56.930
COUNCIL MEETINGS AND COMPLAIN

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:59.233
AND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY DID WAS

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:00.401
ACTUALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:39:00.467 --> 01:39:01.201
ACCIDENTS BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:03.003
PEOPLE THAT COULD COULD OF GONE

01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:04.071
THROUGH WITH THE SAFETY LOS AND

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:05.639
I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.

01:39:05.706 --> 01:39:06.840
SLAMMED ON THEIR BRAKES AND REAR

01:39:06.907 --> 01:39:08.175
REAR ENDED WE HAD A LOT OF

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.543
ACCIDENTS AND IT GOT TO THE

01:39:09.610 --> 01:39:10.210
POINT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY TOOK

01:39:10.277 --> 01:39:12.846
OUT ALL OF THE CAMERAS.

01:39:12.913 --> 01:39:14.648
SO THAT THAT LEADS ME TO A VERY

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:15.883
IMPORTANT ISSUE THEY WERE

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.818
COMPARING THE STOP LIGHT CAMERAS

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:19.987
WITH THE CAMP THE OTHER CAMERAS

01:39:20.054 --> 01:39:21.322
IS GOING TO BE ON THE BUS. FOR

01:39:21.388 --> 01:39:22.856
ANIMAL I KNOW I NOTICE BUT

01:39:22.923 --> 01:39:24.291
HERE'S THE DEAL AT LEAST WHEN

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.259
YOU'RE GOING INTO A TRAFFIC

01:39:25.326 --> 01:39:26.927

A RED STOP ORDER IS GOING TO BE

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:38.472
COMING NEXT AND IT'S GONNA

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:40.274
PREPARE PEOPLE DRIVING BY.

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:41.575
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY BETTER

01:39:41.642 --> 01:39:42.242
STOP IF NOT THEY'RE GOING TO GET

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:44.645
A ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:44.878
DOLLAR.

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.780
TICKET OR ARE WE GOING TO HAVE

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:47.881

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:50.050
ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION AS MOST

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:51.352
PEOPLE ARE NOT AS ARE DRIVING

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:56.156
LISTEN TO THE MUSIC -- SOME

01:39:56.223 --> 01:39:57.291
PEOPLE ARE GONNA DRIVE BY NOT

01:39:57.358 --> 01:39:58.525
PAY ATTENTION UP PEOPLE ARE

GONNA SEE TRAFFIC COLLISIONS.

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:04.365
AND PROBABLY MORBIDITY AND

01:40:04.431 --> 01:40:06.066
POTENTIALLY MORE MORTALITY WHICH

01:40:06.133 --> 01:40:07.468
I DON'T WANT TO SEE BUT HOW HOW

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:08.335
WOULD HOW WOULD WE GIVE WARNINGS

01:40:08.402 --> 01:40:10.337
TOUR BUSES RIGHT NOW WHEN

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:11.872
THEY'RE GOING TO DO STOP THEY

01:40:11.939 --> 01:40:13.273
HAVE AN AMBER LIGHT COMES ON

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:14.775
WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO STOP THAT

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:15.943

SCHOOL BUSES ABOUT TO STOP.

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:23.050
AND THEN -- WHEN THEY DO PULL

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:24.418
OVER THE REDS COME ON AND THEY

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:25.619
FOR THE FLASHING REDS ARE ON AND

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:27.020

TRY TO PROTECT THE KIDS?

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:34.561
SO THE THIS BEST A STOP SIGN

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:36.363
POPS OUT ON THE SIDE OF THE BUS.

01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:38.899

01:40:38.966 --> 01:40:39.900
A WARNING TIME PERIOD.

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:42.136
THERE IS ALSO A WARNING TIME

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:43.370
HERE WHERE THEY ASSUME THAT

01:40:43.437 --> 01:40:45.339
LIGHT TRUCKS ARE MOVING ALONG

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:47.741
SIDE ABBAS AND THEY GO TO PULL

01:40:47.808 --> 01:40:48.742
ROOM THEY STOP.

01:40:48.809 --> 01:40:50.411
THERE IS A LIKE SIX SECONDS

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:53.580
BEFORE THE STOP ARM COMES OUT.

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:55.682
THAT ALLOWS BUT EVERYBODY ELSE

01:40:55.749 --> 01:40:58.085
YOU KNOW THERE'S A AMBER.

01:40:58.152 --> 01:41:00.421
SCHOOL BUS PULLS OVER YOUR

LIKE I USED TO BE A PARAMEDIC

01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:08.595
AND WE HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS

01:41:08.662 --> 01:41:09.863
ARE UNITS AND I GOT.

01:41:09.930 --> 01:41:12.065
HIT THREE TIMES BY DRIVERS THAT

01:41:12.132 --> 01:41:14.001
JUST DON'T PAY ATTENTION BUT THE

01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:15.202
PROBLEM IS.

01:41:15.269 --> 01:41:16.737
THIS WORKS.

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:17.738
IN THE STATE SET OF USERS

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:20.207
THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD A 40% DROP

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:21.041
IN GEORGIA.

01:41:21.108 --> 01:41:23.811
IN MARYLAND THEY'VE HAD A 50%

01:41:23.877 --> 01:41:25.312
DROP IN VIOLATIONS.

01:41:25.379 --> 01:41:27.448
THEY HAVE NOT AS MANY KIDS WE

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:29.016
HAVE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:30.684
RIGHT BETTER DEPENDED ON THE

01:41:30.751 --> 01:41:32.219
SAFETY THESE BUSES THESE BOSSES

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.787
ARE ISLANDS THEY'RE NOT LIKE AN

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:35.322
INTERSECTION EVERYBODY KNOWS

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.190
THERE'S AN INTERSECTION HERE'S A

01:41:36.256 --> 01:41:38.025
LIGHT IT'S BEEN THERE FOREVER I

01:41:38.091 --> 01:41:39.326
DRIVE THROUGH THERE RIGHT.

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.961
BUSES ARE ISLANDS THEY MOVE

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:42.696
AROUND AND THEY'RE THE ONLY

01:41:42.763 --> 01:41:44.131
THING TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS AND

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:46.166
UNFORTUNATELY EVERYTHING WE'VE

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:47.935
DONE HERE IN THIS LEGISLATURE

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.937
EVERYTHING WE'VE ADDED ON WE'VE

01:41:50.003 --> 01:41:51.738
GOTTEN SOME PROTECTION. THREE

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:53.474
POINT SEVEN MILLION VIOLATIONS

01:41:53.540 --> 01:41:55.375
AND THESE ARE SPEEDING CARS

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:57.110
THESE ARE NOT LIKE CRAWLS BY.

01:41:57.177 --> 01:42:00.514
AND SO IT'S A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I

01:42:00.581 --> 01:42:01.114
KNOW IT'S HARD TO KIND OF LIKE

01:42:01.181 --> 01:42:03.484
YOU GET AWAY FROM OKAY RED LIGHT.

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.018
RED LIGHT.

01:42:05.085 --> 01:42:08.722
INTERSECTION HAS THESE.

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:09.957
BIG PROBLEMS.

01:42:10.023 --> 01:42:10.824
THIS IS A SCHOOL BUS SITUATION

01:42:10.891 --> 01:42:12.226
THESE CAMERAS ARE EVEN DIFFERENT

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:12.726
THE PIXEL RATE ON A MORE

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:13.026
DIFFERENT.

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:13.594
THEY'RE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

01:42:13.660 --> 01:42:14.761
TECHNOLOGY.

01:42:14.828 --> 01:42:17.231
AND FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS IN

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:18.332
THAT JURISDICTION'S THERE'S

01:42:18.398 --> 01:42:19.867
BILLBOARDS TO HAVE TO BE PUT UP

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.401
THEIR SPECIAL SIGNAGE ON THE

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:22.669
BACK OF THE BUS IS THAT YOU HAVE

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:23.403
TO ADD.

01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:24.438
THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:26.306
THINGS THIS IS A DIFFERENT

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:27.975
ANIMAL THAN AN INTERSECTION OKAY

01:42:28.041 --> 01:42:29.176
AND CAN YOU ELABORATE I KNOW

01:42:29.243 --> 01:42:31.311
THERE ARE SPECIAL INSTANCES --

01:42:31.378 --> 01:42:33.480
ON A SCHOOL BUS WHEN THE SCHOOL

01:42:33.547 --> 01:42:35.716
BUS DRIVER ACTUALLY NEEDS TO GET

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.484
OUT AN ESCORT THE STUDENTS

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:40.654
ACROSS ACROSS WALKER WHERE CAN

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:43.690
YOU ELABORATE ON THAT.

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:44.324
NOW I KNOW IN ALL THE FOLLOWING

01:42:44.391 --> 01:42:46.193
THAT GOT THAT RULE THERE'S A LOT

01:42:46.260 --> 01:42:47.394
THERE'S A THERE'S A A LAW IS A

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:48.395
GOOD LAW IT SAYS THAT THE SCHOOL

01:42:48.462 --> 01:42:49.463
BUS DRIVERS.

01:42:49.530 --> 01:42:51.131
MUST GET OFF AND AND AND I

01:42:51.198 --> 01:42:52.165
ESCORT.

01:42:52.232 --> 01:42:53.634
CHILDREN WHERE THEY THINK THAT

01:42:53.700 --> 01:42:55.369
IT'S THERE THAT'S NECESSARY TO

01:42:55.435 --> 01:42:56.103
DO THAT.

01:42:56.169 --> 01:42:59.239
THE PRODUCT BUT IT DOES NOT

01:42:59.306 --> 01:42:59.940
REQUIRE THEM TO DO IT.

01:43:00.007 --> 01:43:01.408
THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT IS

01:43:01.475 --> 01:43:03.577
SPECIAL IN RURAL AREAS LIKE YOU

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:05.112

AND FALL OUT YOUR RIVERSIDE AREA.

01:43:09.249 --> 01:43:10.150
IT'S A LONG BUS RIDE FOR THOSE

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:10.918
KIDS.

01:43:10.984 --> 01:43:12.719
IF THE IF THE DRIVER GOT OFF

01:43:12.786 --> 01:43:14.021
EVERY TIME.

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:15.522
IT WOULDN'T BE AN HOUR RIDE IT

01:43:15.589 --> 01:43:16.857
WOULD BE A TWO ARE RIGHT IT IS

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.358
JUST NOT PRACTICAL BUT THE LAWS

01:43:18.425 --> 01:43:19.259
THERE.

01:43:19.326 --> 01:43:21.194
AND THEY CAN AND THEY SHOULD AND

01:43:21.261 --> 01:43:23.230
THEY DO GET OFF TO PROTECT THOSE

01:43:23.297 --> 01:43:25.365
KIDS UNFORTUNATELY ONE OF THE

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:26.500
THINGS WE FOUND IN THE UC

01:43:26.567 --> 01:43:29.469
BERKELEY ANALYSIS OF THE DATA.

01:43:29.536 --> 01:43:31.238
WE SUSPECT THAT A COUPLE THE

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:33.240
INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE HIT AROUND

01:43:33.307 --> 01:43:34.641
THOSE BOSSES WERE THE DRIVERS.

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:36.043
AND WE'RE STILL TRYING TO WE

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.810
CAN'T READ THE REST OF THE

01:43:36.877 --> 01:43:38.178

ALSO ENFORCE THE INSPECTION OF

01:51:12.732 --> 01:51:13.600
BUSES AND -- AND THOSE WHERE

01:51:13.666 --> 01:51:14.734
THIS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO MAKE

01:51:14.801 --> 01:51:17.103
SURE THAT THOSE COMPARTMENTS ARE

01:51:17.170 --> 01:51:19.339
IN FACT IN THERE ARE VEHICLES IN

01:51:19.406 --> 01:51:20.673
IN COLORADO WHERE THEY USE IT

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.008
TODAY WHEN THEY HAVE THOSE BUS

TWENTY ONE OR OLDER IN A BUS IS

01:51:48.701 --> 01:51:49.235

THE REASON [inaudible]

01:53:31.538 --> 01:53:33.606
LOW RIDERSHIP.

THREE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.029
SADLY THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

PROJECT ONLY HAS TWELVE POINT

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.400
SIX BILLION SECURED IN FINDING.

01:54:00.466 --> 01:54:01.634

STATE FUNDS AND FEDERAL FUNDS.

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:06.272
THIS MEANS THAT LESS THAN ONE

01:54:19.519 --> 01:54:20.720
AS A RESULT OF THIS MASSIVE

01:54:20.787 --> 01:54:22.388

YOUR OTHER SPEAKERS OPPOSING

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:27.533
PLEASE [inaudible]

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.370
OKAY -- QUESTIONS WERE COMMITTEE

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:33.005
OF CHECK OUT JOHNNY -- FIRST OF

01:58:33.072 --> 01:58:33.973
ALL I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I THINK

01:58:34.040 --> 01:58:35.107
THAT YOU IN THE GOVERNOR

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:37.743
ACTUALLY MILES APART ON THIS ON

01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.245
THIS PROJECT THE GOVERNOR DOES

01:58:39.312 --> 01:58:40.146
SUPPORT THIS.

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.348
AND WHAT HE SAID AS HE WANTS TO

01:58:42.415 --> 01:58:44.851
FINISH UP TO MERCED AND DOWN TO

01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.786
BAKERSFIELD SO THAT WE HAVE AND

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:48.254
AN INCH AND NATIONAL OPERATING

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:49.188
SEGMENT.

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:50.923
THE TEST TRACK SO THAT WE CAN

01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:52.692
CONNECT WITH REGIONAL RAIL THAT

01:58:52.758 --> 01:58:54.694
IS WHAT HE IS FOR AND HE'S NOT

01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:57.497
TRYING TO GET RID OF THE PROJECT --

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:58.865
SECONDLY I JUST WANT TO BRING UP

01:58:58.931 --> 01:59:01.367
SOMETHING THAT WE NEVER TALK

01:59:01.434 --> 01:59:02.935
ABOUT AND THAT'S THE FACT THAT.

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:04.203
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY DEATHS THAT

01:59:04.270 --> 01:59:05.404
HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:06.772
SPEED RAIL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD

01:59:06.839 --> 01:59:11.511
AND SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY NINE

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:12.144
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN IT WAS

01:59:12.211 --> 01:59:12.578
FIRST INSTITUTED.

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:13.813
IN JAPAN.

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:15.214
THERE WAS ONE ACCIDENT THAT

01:59:15.281 --> 01:59:17.083
RESULTED IN SOME DEATHS IN CHINA

01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:19.285
A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THAT'S ALL

01:59:19.352 --> 01:59:21.020
WE HAVE DEBTS ON OUR CALIFORNIA

01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:22.388
HIGHWAYS EVERY TIME WE TURN

01:59:22.455 --> 01:59:23.356
AROUND.

01:59:23.422 --> 01:59:24.891
AND THERE'S NO THERE'S NO

01:59:24.957 --> 01:59:27.193
MONETARY AMOUNT THAT CAN ACCOUNT

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:28.995
FOR THE SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.096
FAIL TO TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:31.831
ABOUT THIS PROJECT SO I JUST

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:32.532
THINK THAT.

01:59:32.598 --> 01:59:33.900
IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:59:33.966 --> 01:59:36.469
TO ALSO RECOGNIZED WHY THIS

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:38.804
IMPORTANT WHY THIS PROJECT IS

01:59:38.871 --> 01:59:41.140
VERY VERY IMPORTANT.

01:59:41.207 --> 01:59:42.975
TO FORWARD CENTER GALGIANI AYE.

01:59:43.042 --> 01:59:44.210
AYE A PER AYE PRESHEAF THOSE

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.811
COMMENTS AND I THINK SAFETY IS A

01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:47.713
VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.

01:59:47.780 --> 01:59:49.081
AND AND I KNOW YOU WERE

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.550
INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING.

01:59:50.616 --> 01:59:52.385
GET THIS ON THE BALLOT AND AND I

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.920
APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS I

01:59:53.986 --> 01:59:55.821
THINK IF IF PEOPLE -- WE'RE JUST

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.156
ASK THE QUESTION HOW WOULD YOU

01:59:57.223 --> 01:59:58.090
LIKE TO GET ON A HIGH SPEED

01:59:58.157 --> 01:59:59.392
TRAIN FROM LOS ANGELES SAN

01:59:59.458 --> 02:00:00.593
FRANCISCO GET THERE IN TWO AND A

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:02.328
HALF HOURS AND PAY A SEVENTY

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:05.264
NINE DOLLAR.

02:00:05.331 --> 02:00:06.532
FEE TO DO THAT.

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:07.300
I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING I WOULD

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:08.167
DRIVE LOS ANGLES AND DO IT I

02:00:08.234 --> 02:00:08.367
MEAN.

02:00:08.434 --> 02:00:09.302
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:00:09.368 --> 02:00:11.804
UNFORTUNATELY -- PROJECT THIS IS

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:13.005
NOT EVEN STATE ARE YOU TALK

02:00:13.072 --> 02:00:14.440
ABOUT TRAINS IN JAPAN.

02:00:14.507 --> 02:00:16.042
OR YOU TALK ABOUT -- THE MAGLEV

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.176
THAT EXISTS IN CHINA GETTING

02:00:17.243 --> 02:00:18.644
FROM THE AIRPORT I MEAN THERE

02:00:18.711 --> 02:00:19.812
ARE TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:21.147
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE STATE

02:00:21.213 --> 02:00:24.817
HAS AN EMBRACE THESE HIGH SPEED

02:00:24.884 --> 02:00:25.418
TRAINS AGO THREE HUNDRED MILES

02:00:25.484 --> 02:00:26.719
AN HOUR.

02:00:26.786 --> 02:00:27.954
AND YOU HAVE FLAT AREA IN THE IN

02:00:28.020 --> 02:00:28.588
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE THEY

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:29.589
PROBABLY COULD DO THREE HUNDRED

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:30.656
MILES AN HOUR PROBABLY GETTING

02:00:30.723 --> 02:00:31.223
OVER SOME HILLS AND GETTING

02:00:31.290 --> 02:00:32.058
THROUGH TUNNELS MIGHT BE A

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:33.759
CHALLENGE BUT AND IN JAPAN I'VE

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:35.494
BEEN ON THOSE TRAINS.

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:36.128
AND THEY HAD AND THEY DO GO OVER

02:00:36.195 --> 02:00:37.196
HILLS AND THEY DO GO THROUGH

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:38.497
TUNNELS AND THE USE OF

02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:40.132
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT YOUR

02:00:40.199 --> 02:00:41.200
TYPICAL STEEL ON STEEL

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.468
TECHNOLOGIES SO.

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:44.570
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THIS THIS

02:00:44.637 --> 02:00:45.371
PROJECT ONE TO GOT OUT OF THE

02:00:45.438 --> 02:00:48.007
GATE -- I DON'T KNOW -- IF WHICH

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:49.241
HAD BEEN MISMANAGED I DON'T KNOW

02:00:49.308 --> 02:00:50.843
IF THE IF THE THE VISION OF WHAT

02:00:50.910 --> 02:00:53.279
WE DEFINE AS HIGH SPEED RAIL WAS.

02:00:53.346 --> 02:00:55.114
WAS ADULTERATED SOMEWHERE ALONG

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:57.216
THE LINE -- I JUST KNOW THE

02:00:57.283 --> 02:00:58.784
CALIFORNIA IS THE INNOVATOR AND

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.286
I I CAN I THINK THAT PEOPLE IN

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:01.520
IN CONCEPT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

02:01:01.587 --> 02:01:03.756
THE ABILITY TO GET ON TRAINS.

02:01:03.823 --> 02:01:04.824
LIKE YOU CAN IN EUROPE LIKE YOU

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.692
CAN IN JAPAN BUT WE ARE A LONG

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:08.260
SINCE STATE WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:09.762
SPRAWL ESPECIALLY IN.

02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:11.163
EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY I MEAN

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:12.431
A LOT TO GET ON THE TRAIN.

02:01:12.498 --> 02:01:14.166
IN -- IN LOOKING TO WHERE I LIVE

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:14.767
IN.

02:01:14.834 --> 02:01:16.002
I'D LIKE TO JUST BE ABLE TO TAKE

02:01:16.068 --> 02:01:17.503
THE TRAIN TO ONTARIO PORT THAT

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:18.638
WOULD SAVE ME A LOT OF TIME.

02:01:18.704 --> 02:01:20.306
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT

02:01:20.373 --> 02:01:22.541
THE SAFETY ATTRIBUTES OF OF

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:23.976
TRAINS BY.

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:25.845
AYE AYE SUPPORT THAT THAT THAT

02:01:25.911 --> 02:01:28.447
IDEA AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN

02:01:28.514 --> 02:01:30.516
RE LOOK AT THIS TRAIN MAYBE WE

02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:37.089
TAKE A PAUSE AND SAY LISTEN IT'S

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:37.723
NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IS

02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:38.691
WHAT I'M EVEN HEARING THAT THIS

02:01:38.758 --> 02:01:39.325
THING IS GOING TO BE WHEN IT'S

02:01:39.392 --> 02:01:40.826
ULTIMATELY COMPLETED IF YOU LOOK.

02:01:40.893 --> 02:01:41.794
AT THE ACTUAL REAL COST OF A

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:42.595
GOING FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:44.130
THE ACTUAL COST MIGHT BE FIVE

02:01:44.196 --> 02:01:44.697
HUNDRED DOLLARS WHEN YOU CAN

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:45.531
STILL GET ON A JET.

02:01:45.598 --> 02:01:47.800
FROM -- SOUTHWEST AT A BURBANK

02:01:47.867 --> 02:01:48.901
FOR SIXTY NINE DOLLARS AND SO

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:50.836
WITH THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY OF THIS

02:01:50.903 --> 02:01:52.004
ONCE IT'S DONE IS ALSO GOING TO

02:01:52.071 --> 02:01:53.439
BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS

02:01:53.506 --> 02:01:54.407
TO BE INVESTIGATED.

02:01:54.473 --> 02:01:56.409
SO MAYBE LOOK AT THIS IS JUST A

02:01:56.475 --> 02:01:57.843
PAUSE UP WE CAN JUST TAKE A STEP

02:01:57.910 --> 02:02:00.446
BACK AND REALLY IDENTIFY WITH

02:02:00.513 --> 02:02:01.247
THIS THING WITH WHAT IS THING

02:02:01.313 --> 02:02:02.548
REALLY GOING TO COST AND IS A

02:02:02.615 --> 02:02:04.784
REALLY MORE INNOVATIVE WAYS. TO

02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.052
TO MOVE PEOPLE WITH -- MORE

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:07.820
MODERN VERSIONS OF WHAT WE

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.188
DEFINE AS HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT I

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:13.092
APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS THANK

02:02:13.159 --> 02:02:14.727
YOU CENTERS ON QUESTIONS FROM

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:15.361
ANYBODY ON THE COMMITTEE CENTER

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:17.363
BATES.

02:02:17.430 --> 02:02:18.664
THANK YOU.

02:02:18.731 --> 02:02:19.965
FINISH AVAIL ENOUGH THANK YOU

02:02:20.032 --> 02:02:21.701
SENATOR STONE FOR BRING IT

02:02:21.767 --> 02:02:23.235
FORWARD I DO THINK THAT.

02:02:23.302 --> 02:02:25.805
THE DIALOGUE ON THIS ISSUE WITH

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:27.406
HIGH SPEED RAIL MUST CONTINUE.

02:02:27.473 --> 02:02:29.041
ON MAYBE WE WILL GET THAT NO

02:02:29.108 --> 02:02:31.010
STATE OF THE ART SYSTEM AT SOME

02:02:31.077 --> 02:02:31.911
POINT IN TIME.

02:02:31.977 --> 02:02:33.112
BY ITS FULL IT MUCH IN THE

02:02:33.179 --> 02:02:34.880
DISTANT FUTURE IN THE SUBSIDY

02:02:34.947 --> 02:02:36.515
ISSUES HUGE.

02:02:36.582 --> 02:02:37.950
BY HAVING THROUGH JOHN NOW ON

02:02:38.017 --> 02:02:39.151
ORANGE COUNTY'S TOLL ROADS FOR

02:02:39.218 --> 02:02:42.154
MANY YEARS AND JOB THE USER FEES

02:02:42.221 --> 02:02:43.122
ARE WHICH WERE THE TOLLS

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:44.356
COLLECTED.

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:46.158
I TOOK A LONG TIME TO CATCH UP

02:02:46.225 --> 02:02:48.060
WITH ALL THE MONTEREY BEEN ISSUE

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:49.862
THE REVENUE BONDS IN FACT

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:51.597
REFINANCING WAS REQUIRED.

02:02:51.664 --> 02:02:53.032
IT'S NOT EVEN POSSIBLE WITH THIS

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:55.301
PROJECT SECONDLY IT'S BEEN MY

02:02:55.367 --> 02:02:56.135
CONCERN.

02:02:56.202 --> 02:02:58.838
THAT SB ONE IS ONLY TEN YEARS

02:02:58.904 --> 02:03:00.372
AND DOG FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IF

02:03:00.439 --> 02:03:02.374
I REMEMBER CORRECTLY FIVE

02:03:02.441 --> 02:03:04.009
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:03:04.076 --> 02:03:05.644
FOR TEN THAT AFTER THAT THERE'S

02:03:05.711 --> 02:03:08.013
NO REQUIREMENT THAT MONEY BE

02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:10.883
SPENT ON OUR WHAT SB ONE LAID

02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:12.952
OUT AND MY CONCERN IS THAT THAT

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.520
WOULD BECOME THE REVENUE STREAM.

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:16.322
SO THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:18.324
WE NEED TO HAVE BECAUSE IT'S SO

02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:19.558
IMPORTANT AND TRANSPORTATION.

02:03:19.625 --> 02:03:22.094
THAT PROMISES MADE TO THE PUBLIC

02:03:22.161 --> 02:03:23.562
ARE PROMISES KEPT.

02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:24.897
AND THAT'S WHAT'S FAILING ON

02:03:24.964 --> 02:03:27.032
MANY FRONTS WE'VE SEEN OUR RADIO

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:29.235
TAX ON SB ONE WE'RE GONNA HOLD

02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:30.970
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HOSTAGE.

02:03:31.036 --> 02:03:32.171
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE I'VE BEEN

02:03:32.238 --> 02:03:33.639
PUT ASIDE.

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:35.207
BUT THE IDEA IS STILL THERE.

02:03:35.274 --> 02:03:37.143
AND I THINK THESE ARE THINGS

02:03:37.209 --> 02:03:38.711
THAT REALLY START TROUBLING ARE

02:03:38.778 --> 02:03:40.146
THE PUBLIC OUT THERE WHO IS

02:03:40.212 --> 02:03:41.714
CRYING.

02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:42.948
FOR A BETTER MOBILITY.

02:03:43.015 --> 02:03:44.817
A WE KNOW THAT CONGESTION IS ONE

02:03:44.884 --> 02:03:46.452
OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH

02:03:46.519 --> 02:03:47.486
THOUGHT.

02:03:47.553 --> 02:03:49.255
TALKS OF FLYING THE AIR YOU KNOW

02:03:49.321 --> 02:03:51.457
SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO

02:03:51.524 --> 02:03:53.058
RAISE THE ISSUE.

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.727
I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY.

02:03:54.794 --> 02:03:56.695
I ACTUALLY SUPPORTED THE BOND

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:58.230
MEASURE WAY BACK WHEN BECAUSE I

02:03:58.297 --> 02:03:59.932
THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET

02:03:59.999 --> 02:04:01.000
SOMETHING THAT SOUNDED GREAT.

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:03.602
HAND JOB PERHAPS THE BUSINESS

02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:04.603
PLAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:06.739
MORE CLOSELY ANALYZED WAY BACK

02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:08.741
WHEN IT WASN'T -- FORTUNATELY

02:04:08.808 --> 02:04:10.576
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION

02:04:10.643 --> 02:04:12.845

MTC IS SPONSORING SB ONE FIFTY

02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:22.561
TWO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE

02:13:22.627 --> 02:13:23.962
STATE'S ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

02:13:24.029 --> 02:13:25.664
PROGRAM CAN BE DELIVERED MORE

02:13:25.731 --> 02:13:27.099
EFFECTIVELY AND MORE EFFICIENTLY

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.800
BY DELEGATING A MUCH LARGER

02:13:28.867 --> 02:13:30.235
SHARE TO THE REGIONAL LEVEL.

02:13:30.302 --> 02:13:31.269
AND REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT

02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:32.804
THAT EVERY REGIONALLY APPROVED

02:13:32.871 --> 02:13:35.073
PROJECT -- TODAY BE APPROVED AND

02:13:35.140 --> 02:13:37.576
SEES ME ALLOCATED BY THE CTC A

02:13:37.642 --> 02:13:39.010
STEP THAT ADDS TWO MONTHS OF

02:13:39.077 --> 02:13:40.312
UNNECESSARY DELAY TO EVERY

02:13:40.379 --> 02:13:41.480
PROJECT.

02:13:41.546 --> 02:13:43.382
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:44.149
THE CHALLENGES THAT AND HERE'S

02:13:44.216 --> 02:13:45.851
FACED REACHING THEIR GREENHOUSE

02:13:45.917 --> 02:13:48.153
GAS REDUCTION TARGETS AND EIGHTY

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.021
P. PROGRAM IS VERY WELL SUITED

02:13:50.088 --> 02:13:51.757
PROGRAM TO ASSIST WITH THAT --

02:13:51.823 --> 02:13:53.792
WE WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THE

02:13:53.859 --> 02:13:55.827
STATE'S MODEL FOR FUNDING

02:13:55.894 --> 02:13:57.829
TRANSPORTATION AND FOR DRESSING

02:13:57.896 --> 02:14:01.133
THE TRANSPORTATION -- IMPACTS OF

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.100
ARTS USING THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:03.402
IMPACTS ASSOCIATE WITH

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:04.536
TRANSPORTATION IS VERY MUCH A

02:14:04.603 --> 02:14:05.937
BOTTOM UP MODEL.

02:14:06.004 --> 02:14:07.439
AND SO WE THINK THAT THE ATP

02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:10.242
SHOULD REALLY FOLLOW THAT -- THE

02:14:10.308 --> 02:14:11.943
75% WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THAT'S

02:14:12.010 --> 02:14:12.811
SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH THE

02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:14.212
STEP THE STATE TRANSPORTATION

02:14:14.279 --> 02:14:15.981
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.

02:14:16.047 --> 02:14:18.016
AND AGAIN SINCE -- GETTING MORE

02:14:18.083 --> 02:14:20.452
PEOPLE TO BUY CAN WALK TO ON

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:21.653
THEIR DESTINATIONS TO BUY CAN

02:14:21.720 --> 02:14:23.422
WALK TO TRANSIT IS SO ESSENTIAL

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:24.790
AS PART OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

02:14:24.856 --> 02:14:26.158
REDUCTION TARGETS WE THINK THAT

02:14:26.224 --> 02:14:27.325
FOLLOWING THAT.

02:14:27.392 --> 02:14:29.995
THAT 75% BOTTOM UP APPROACH

02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:31.596
MAKES SENSE -- WE'VE HEARD A LOT

02:14:31.663 --> 02:14:33.165
FROM SOME OF THE THE FOLKS WHO

02:14:33.231 --> 02:14:34.566
ARE IN OPPOSITION WERE VERY

02:14:34.633 --> 02:14:35.233
INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THEM

02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:36.234
WE THINK THAT.

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:37.803
I'M A LOT OF THEIR CONCERNS CAN

02:14:37.869 --> 02:14:38.603
BE ADDRESSED AS THE SENATOR

02:14:38.670 --> 02:14:40.505
STATED -- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:41.740
TAKE A MOMENT TO MENTION A

02:14:41.807 --> 02:14:42.574
COUPLE OF ISSUES ON THE

02:14:42.641 --> 02:14:44.075
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES PIECE

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:45.977
OUR INTENT WAS NEVER TO NOT --

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:47.946
ENSURE THAT THE REGIONAL PROGRAM

02:14:48.013 --> 02:14:49.514
ON REACH THOSE TARGETS AS WELL

02:14:49.581 --> 02:14:51.483
IN FACT ON TODAY THE OVER FOUR

02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:53.452
CYCLES 85% OF FUNDS FROM THE

02:14:53.518 --> 02:14:55.120
REGIONAL PROGRAM HAVE BEEN

02:14:55.187 --> 02:14:55.654
INVESTED IN DISADVANTAGED

02:14:55.720 --> 02:14:56.455
COMMUNITIES.

02:14:56.521 --> 02:14:57.989
ON WITH RESPECT TO THE RURAL

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:00.392
PROGRAM -- WE ANTICIPATED THAT

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:01.493
THERE WOULD BE SOME CONCERNED

02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:03.562
REDUCING THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM --

02:15:03.628 --> 02:15:05.497
SIGNIFICANTLY SO WE DID INCREASE

02:15:05.564 --> 02:15:08.133
THE REGIONAL POT 215% WHICH IS

02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:10.068
WHAT THE RURAL AND SMALL

02:15:10.135 --> 02:15:11.036
URBANIZED AREAS HAVE BEEN

02:15:11.102 --> 02:15:16.208
GETTING TO TO DATE INCLUDING THE

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:16.808
STATE WIDE PROGRAM AND THEN OF

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:18.076
COURSE RURAL AND SMALL URBANIZED

02:15:18.143 --> 02:15:18.610
AREAS CAN STILL COMPETE.

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:19.478
WITHIN THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM SO

02:15:19.544 --> 02:15:20.111
THEY'RE KIND OF WOULD ACTUALLY

02:15:20.178 --> 02:15:22.747
BE RECEIVING POTENTIALLY MORE ON

02:15:22.814 --> 02:15:24.149

02:18:04.376 --> 02:18:06.177
OF SB.

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:07.846
ONE WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:09.481
BE CHANGING.

02:18:09.547 --> 02:18:12.283
SB ONE FUNDED PROGRAM -- SO

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:14.452
EARLY THE INTO THE LIFE OF

02:18:14.519 --> 02:18:17.756
HAVING SB ONE DOLLARS INFUSION

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:18.323
TO THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

02:18:18.390 --> 02:18:19.057
PROGRAM.

02:18:19.124 --> 02:18:20.358
WE DON'T THINK OF POLICY BASIS

02:18:20.425 --> 02:18:21.693
THE CASE HAS BEEN MADE FOR

02:18:21.760 --> 02:18:24.129
RETOOLING THIS PROGRAM IN THE

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:27.165
THIS IS THE FIRST CYCLE AWARE

02:18:27.232 --> 02:18:29.100
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION FUNDS HAVE

02:18:29.167 --> 02:18:30.335
BEEN AWARDED WITH THE INFUSION

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:32.971
TO SB ONE DOLLARS HAVE PROVIDED

02:18:33.605 --> 02:18:34.305
PROGRAM.

02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:35.340
AND SO WE THINK THERE'S A

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:36.775
QUESTION ABOUT IMING WHEN IT

02:18:36.841 --> 02:18:38.610
COMES TO THE PROPOSAL ESPECIALLY

02:18:38.677 --> 02:18:39.944
WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT

02:18:40.011 --> 02:18:42.380
THE HISTORY OF HOW MUCH TIME A

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:44.816
CALLOUS TA CALTRANS CDC AND

02:18:52.691 --> 02:18:53.825
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM.

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.193
WE THINK THAT TO HAVE A BILL

02:18:55.260 --> 02:18:57.095
COME FORWARD IN THIS FASHION

02:18:57.162 --> 02:18:59.864
UNDER THIS TIMING CONSTRAINTS.

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.466

02:19:01.533 --> 02:19:03.234
TIMING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS

TO WEIGH IN AND WORK WE HAVE

02:19:04.836 --> 02:19:05.737
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ALL

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:08.740
JUMP TO GIVEN THE TWO MINUTE

02:19:08.807 --> 02:19:09.908
TIME CONSTRAINT -- WE REALLY ARE

02:19:09.974 --> 02:19:11.943

FRANKLY IN OUR TERRITORY -- 45%

02:19:15.013 --> 02:19:16.114

COMMUNITIES ARE NOTIFIED OF LOS

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.951
ANGELES COUNTY USING THE CURRENT.

02:19:20.018 --> 02:19:21.386
ACCOUNT VIRUS FREE MODEL THAT

02:19:21.453 --> 02:19:24.222
WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH SB -- FIVE

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:25.090
THREE FIVE WE ACTUALLY

02:19:25.156 --> 02:19:26.891
APPRECIATE THE SPONSOR AND THE

02:19:26.958 --> 02:19:28.760
AUTHORS OF PLEDGE TO MAKE

02:19:28.827 --> 02:19:30.829
AMENDMENTS TO ESSENTIALLY

02:19:30.895 --> 02:19:32.731
ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT

02:19:32.797 --> 02:19:34.466
ADDRESSES IN THE AYE BEHOLDER

02:19:34.532 --> 02:19:35.767
WE'D LIKE TO BE PART OF THAT.

02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:37.669
CONVERSATION -- IF IT'S NOT

02:19:37.736 --> 02:19:39.571
CALLIN VIRAL SCREEN -- THEN

02:19:39.637 --> 02:19:40.371
WE'RE GOING TO BE CONCERNED

02:19:40.438 --> 02:19:41.873
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT MEASURE IN

02:19:41.940 --> 02:19:45.076
TWO ISSUES GIVEN THE PROPENSITY.

02:19:45.143 --> 02:19:47.812
OF NEED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:49.280
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS

02:19:49.347 --> 02:19:51.916
ALSO PROVIDE IMPORTANT SAFETY

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:53.785
BENEFIT 30% OF THE SERIOUS AND

02:19:53.852 --> 02:19:55.320
NON MOTORIZED ENTRIES.

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:57.021
TAKE PLACE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY

02:19:57.088 --> 02:19:57.922
SO WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE

02:19:57.989 --> 02:19:59.791
CONVERSATION ONCE AGAIN WE HAVE

02:19:59.858 --> 02:20:04.162
GREAT RESPECT I THINK THAT WOULD

02:20:04.229 --> 02:20:05.363
DOES FROM MTC.

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:06.030
POINTED TO THE PERFORMANCE.

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:07.265
WITH RESPECT TO HAVING PROJECTS

02:20:07.332 --> 02:20:08.099
INVESTED IN DISADVANTAGED

02:20:08.166 --> 02:20:09.434
COMMUNITIES FROM THE CURRENT

02:20:09.501 --> 02:20:13.171
PROCESS -- WE'RE TALKING OVER

02:20:13.238 --> 02:20:15.874
88% I THINK THE WITNESSES 85%

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:18.176
THE ONLY -- REPORTS AS 80% OF

02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:20.445
PROJECTS -- HAVE BEEN INVESTED

02:20:20.512 --> 02:20:22.113
ACROSS ALL OF THE CYCLES AND

02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:23.314
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS

02:20:23.381 --> 02:20:25.183
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT A CHANGE

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:26.551
IN YOU KNOW WHETHER THAT WOULD

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:28.019
MEET THAT PERFORMANCE METRIC

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.220
WHICH IS MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT

02:20:29.287 --> 02:20:30.588
THE STATUTE CALLS.

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:33.758
FOR THE STATURE CALLS 425-

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:33.992
PERCENT.

02:20:34.058 --> 02:20:36.060
AS A MINIMUM.

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.128
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

02:20:37.195 --> 02:20:38.296
THE CALAVERAS FREE MODEL IS

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:39.864
CLEARED IF CLEARLY DEFINED A

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:40.732
STATUTE.

02:20:40.799 --> 02:20:42.634
AND WE'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT THE

02:20:42.700 --> 02:20:44.402
IMPACT ON IMMEDIATE CYCLES BUT I

02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:46.437
DID HEAR THE AUTHOR SPEAK TO HIS

02:20:46.504 --> 02:20:48.907
INTENT -- TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT

02:20:48.973 --> 02:20:50.308
THAT WOULD ADDRESS THAT TIMING

02:20:50.375 --> 02:20:53.278
ISSUES BECAUSE FRANKLY THE LAST

02:20:53.344 --> 02:20:55.213
CYCLE WE SAW A LOT OF INVESTMENT

02:20:55.280 --> 02:20:57.749
OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR TERRITORY.

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:59.918
AND FRANKLY THE WAY THE BILL

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:02.020
BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED -- IT

02:21:02.086 --> 02:21:03.321
WOULD PUT ALL THOSE AWARDS IN

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:04.689
JEOPARDY.

02:21:04.756 --> 02:21:06.391
BAR REQUIRED THE CTC AND THE

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:08.326
APPEALS TO KIND OF SCRATCH WHAT

02:21:08.393 --> 02:21:09.527
THEY'VE DONE AND START OVER AND

02:21:09.594 --> 02:21:10.695
SO.

02:21:10.762 --> 02:21:12.697
THANK YOU SIR YEAR. TWO MINISTRY

02:21:12.764 --> 02:21:14.465
WITH THOSE REASONS RIPPLES WE

02:21:14.532 --> 02:21:16.034
PLEDGE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:18.002
GOING FOR WILL HAVE HIM RESPOND

02:21:18.069 --> 02:21:21.039
TO THOSE.

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:24.275
TO THE NEXT [inaudible]

02:21:24.342 --> 02:21:30.782
HI JULIE [inaudible]

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:33.017
OKAY -- WE WORK WITH ME IS IN

02:21:33.084 --> 02:21:34.619
THE CENTRAL VALLEY ASSEMBLY CAN

02:21:34.686 --> 02:21:36.821
VALUE CENTER CHIRLA -- WITH THE

02:21:36.888 --> 02:21:37.922
INCLUSION OF THIS VAST MUSES

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:39.691
PART OF THE ATP THROUGHOUT THE

02:21:39.757 --> 02:21:40.692
STATE PROCESS WE'VE SEEN A

02:21:40.758 --> 02:21:43.161
PROGRESS THAT IS MORE INCLUSIVE

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:44.329
AND TRANSPARENT AND IT WOULD BE

02:21:44.395 --> 02:21:45.196
OTHERWISE.

02:21:45.263 --> 02:21:46.497
ON THE TV IS A MODEL OF HOW THE

02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:47.799
STATE CAN INVEST IN AND

02:21:47.866 --> 02:21:50.368
ENCOURAGE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION.

02:21:50.435 --> 02:21:52.470
WE DON'T SEE HOWEVER -- STRONG

02:21:52.537 --> 02:21:53.805
REASONING BEHIND THE DRASTIC RE

02:21:53.872 --> 02:21:55.840
SHIFTING OF THIS PROGRAMS

02:21:55.907 --> 02:21:57.509
FUNDING WHICH PROVIDES

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:59.277
OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL

02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:00.445
COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED

02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:01.880
COMMUNITIES THROUGH THE STATE --

02:22:01.946 --> 02:22:03.915
PROCESS -- BY PUTTING A LARGE

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:06.684
PORTION INTO A REGIONAL PROGRAM.

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:07.886
CURRENTLY THIS REGIONAL PROGRAMS

02:22:07.952 --> 02:22:10.054
NOT WELL DEFINED IN TERMS OF

02:22:10.121 --> 02:22:12.223
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY --

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:12.757
WHICH ARE TWO OF OUR MAJOR

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:13.791
CONCERNS.

02:22:13.858 --> 02:22:14.926
IN ADDITION THERE'S ALSO A

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:17.028
REDUCTION -- OVER ALL OF THE

02:22:17.095 --> 02:22:18.296
AVAILABLE POTENTIAL FUNDS THAT

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:19.864
WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR RURAL

02:22:19.931 --> 02:22:24.802
COMMUNITIES -- DESPITE THE 15%

02:22:24.869 --> 02:22:25.904
OF THE TOTAL AVAILABLE FUNDS

02:22:25.970 --> 02:22:27.272
THAT WOULD BE MADE -- AVAILABLE

02:22:27.338 --> 02:22:29.374
FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES TO COMPETE

02:22:29.440 --> 02:22:32.343
FOR OUR OVERALL -- DWINDLING.

02:22:32.410 --> 02:22:33.378
THE CURRENT STRUCTURE THE TV IS

02:22:33.444 --> 02:22:34.712
RELATIVELY EFFECTIVE AND WE'RE

02:22:34.779 --> 02:22:36.080
CONCERNED THAT THE SHIFT BEING

02:22:36.147 --> 02:22:38.182
PROPOSED HERE CURRENTLY DOES NOT

02:22:38.249 --> 02:22:39.751
ENSURE THAT THE HISTORICAL THIS

02:22:39.817 --> 02:22:41.085
INVESTMENT IN LOW INCOME

02:22:41.152 --> 02:22:42.287
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF

02:22:42.353 --> 02:22:44.055
COLOR WILL NOT BE EXACERBATED AT

02:22:44.122 --> 02:22:45.290
THE REGIONAL LEVEL.

02:22:45.356 --> 02:22:47.358
UNFORTUNATELY THE NEEDS AND

02:22:47.425 --> 02:22:49.027
PRIORITIES AT THE COMMUTE WITH

02:22:49.093 --> 02:22:49.928
OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK

02:22:49.994 --> 02:22:51.829
WITH ARE OFTEN NOT PARTICULARLY

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:53.331
WELL REPRESENTED BY REGIONAL

02:22:53.398 --> 02:22:54.499
AGENCIES.

02:22:54.565 --> 02:22:55.733
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT AT THE

02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.302
VERY LEAST THERE BACKSTOPS THE

02:22:57.368 --> 02:22:59.070
MECHANISMS FOR TRANSPARENCY

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:00.972
WHICH THE STATE CAN HAVE A

02:23:01.039 --> 02:23:03.107
CRITICAL ROLE IN -- JUST AN

02:23:03.174 --> 02:23:04.976
EXAMPLE CV LANGKAH PROJECT IN

02:23:05.043 --> 02:23:06.444
THE COACHELLA VALLEY.

02:23:06.511 --> 02:23:08.179
IT'S A LARGE PROJECTS THAT EVEN

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:09.480
INCLUDES THINGS LIKE

02:23:09.547 --> 02:23:11.649
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR GOLF CARTS --

02:23:11.716 --> 02:23:12.850
IN REALITY THIS IS SOMETHING

02:23:12.917 --> 02:23:14.552
THAT'S NOT BENEFITING DISAPPEARS

02:23:14.619 --> 02:23:15.853
COMMUNITY COULD TELL LIKE THOSE

02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:17.655
IN THE EASTERN COACHELLA VALLEY

02:23:17.722 --> 02:23:19.357
THAT WE WORK WITH -- JUST AN

02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:21.092
EXAMPLE OF HOW REGIONAL PRIORITY

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:22.794
SOMETIMES DON'T LINE UP WITH

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:24.896
THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY --

02:23:24.963 --> 02:23:26.464
DISADVANTAGE ON A CORPORATE

02:23:26.531 --> 02:23:27.899
COMMUNITIES AND RURAL AREAS

02:23:27.966 --> 02:23:29.133
OFTEN NEED SOMETHING AS SIMPLE

02:23:29.200 --> 02:23:31.069
AS SIDEWALKS -- WE JUST WANT TO

02:23:31.135 --> 02:23:31.903
MAKE SURE THAT THESE COMMUNITY

02:23:31.970 --> 02:23:34.939
STILL HAVE A CHANCE AT THIS --

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.641
OPPORTUNITY SO THESE ARE JUST

02:23:36.708 --> 02:23:37.275
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE

02:23:37.342 --> 02:23:41.579
HOLD ON SB ONE THANK YOU FOR

02:23:41.646 --> 02:23:43.147
YOUR TIME THANK YOU NEXT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS

02:23:44.082 --> 02:23:44.582
GUS CORN WE HAVE TO

TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OF

02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:47.051
MONTEREY COUNTY AND STANISLAUS

02:23:47.118 --> 02:23:49.087
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE

02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:50.955
CONCERNS SON NOT OFFICIAL POST

02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:51.956
POSITION.

02:23:52.023 --> 02:23:53.224
HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:54.692
DEFERENCE FOR SENATE BILL WOULD

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:56.094
VERY CLOSELY WITH HIM ON THE

02:23:56.160 --> 02:23:57.428
ESTABLISHMENT OF SEVERAL TO

02:23:57.495 --> 02:23:59.063
COMPETITIVE POGRAMS SO JUST A

02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:00.932
COUPLE QUICK POINTS I THINK. ONE

02:24:00.999 --> 02:24:03.601
CONCERN IS WE DON'T WANT TO PUT

02:24:03.668 --> 02:24:06.204
AN ARTIFICIAL CAP UP ON THE

02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.439
FUNDING WHERE WERE PARSON OUT

02:24:08.506 --> 02:24:09.741
THE FUNDING SO THAT EVERYBODY'S

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:12.410
GETTING A SLIVER NO ONE'S

02:24:12.477 --> 02:24:13.544
GETTING FED SO THAT WE'RE NOT.

02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:14.312
EXPEDITING OR DELIVERING

02:24:14.379 --> 02:24:15.780
PROJECTS OF SIGNIFICANCE I THINK

02:24:15.847 --> 02:24:17.648
THAT'S ONE CONCERN WE ARE

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.450
EXTREMELY CONCERNED HOWEVER

02:24:19.517 --> 02:24:21.119
ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY AND

02:24:21.185 --> 02:24:22.620
THAT'S SOMETHING I KNOW THE

02:24:22.687 --> 02:24:24.022
CENTERS CONCERNED ABOUT.

02:24:24.088 --> 02:24:25.957
TO THE PARTICULAR OUTCOME BUT

02:24:26.024 --> 02:24:28.393
CYCLE -- FOR BUT FOR SMALLER

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:30.261
JURISDICTIONS YOU DO GET BANG

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:31.696
FOR YOUR BUCK -- WHEN YOU INVEST

02:24:31.763 --> 02:24:32.830
ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST AND EVEN

02:24:32.897 --> 02:24:34.565
CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOME OF THE

02:24:34.632 --> 02:24:36.334
DISSIDENTS COMMUNITIES THAT MR

02:24:36.401 --> 02:24:38.403
ENTRY EVEN MENTIONED -- SO I

02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:39.837
THINK FOR THOSE REASONS PLUS --

02:24:39.904 --> 02:24:41.439
WE DO THINK THAT IT IS WORTH

02:24:41.506 --> 02:24:43.174
EXPLORING -- THE EVALUATION

02:24:43.241 --> 02:24:46.044
CRITERIA IT'S SORT OF A CLUNKY.

02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:47.378
EVALUATION WHEN YOU'VE GOT

02:24:47.445 --> 02:24:49.080
SOMEBODY SAY FROM YOU KNOW

02:24:49.147 --> 02:24:50.381
HUMBOLDT THAT'S PROBABLY

02:24:50.448 --> 02:24:52.150
EVALUATING A PROJECT IN ORANGE

02:24:52.216 --> 02:24:53.418
COUNTY WHERE THEY DON'T REALLY

02:24:53.484 --> 02:24:55.019
HAVE A TRUE APPRECIATION --

02:24:55.086 --> 02:24:56.721
UNDERSTANDING OF THAT PROJECT IN

02:24:56.788 --> 02:24:58.389
THE COUNTY SO FOR THOSE REASONS

02:24:58.456 --> 02:24:59.357
I THINK WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO

02:24:59.424 --> 02:25:00.892
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR WE LOOK FOR

02:25:00.958 --> 02:25:01.826

NEED TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDING

ALLOCATION THROUGH APPROXIMATE

02:28:17.989 --> 02:28:18.489
TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH I

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:19.290
BELIEVE THAT SEVEN HUNDRED

02:28:19.357 --> 02:28:20.858
MILLION ROLLS THROUGH.

02:28:20.925 --> 02:28:22.226
YEAH THAT'S TRUE YEAH WE'RE

02:28:22.293 --> 02:28:24.929
WE'RE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A SMOOTH

02:28:24.996 --> 02:28:27.565

THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I THINK

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:33.437
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ONE OF

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:34.939
THE WITNESSES SAID THAT AT THIS

02:28:35.006 --> 02:28:36.340
CURRENT FORMULA DOES NOT IMPACT

02:28:36.407 --> 02:28:38.509
RULE I I I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

02:28:38.576 --> 02:28:40.044
WITNESS LIVES IN A RURAL AREA --

02:28:40.111 --> 02:28:41.746
IN THIS KERN FOR ME THAT WOULD

02:28:41.812 --> 02:28:43.881
IMPACT -- RURAL AND WHAT I

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:46.250
REALLY APPRECIATE -- THE CHAIR

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:47.151
SAYING HE SAID HE'S GONNA

02:28:47.218 --> 02:28:49.553
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT FORMULA --

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:51.322
AND WORK WITH INTERESTED PARTIES

02:28:51.389 --> 02:28:52.290
AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS BILL

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:55.026
MOVES FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH --

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:56.661
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A

02:28:56.727 --> 02:28:58.496
CONVERSATION ABOUT FIGURE OUT

02:28:58.562 --> 02:29:00.398
WHERE THAT SWEET SPOT IS -- IN

02:29:00.464 --> 02:29:01.899
REGARDS TO THE FORMULA AS WE

02:29:01.966 --> 02:29:05.269
MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT

02:29:05.336 --> 02:29:06.437
WOULD BE A FAIR ASSESSMENT MR.

02:29:06.504 --> 02:29:08.673
YES THAT'S TRUE AND THE YEAH

02:29:08.739 --> 02:29:10.675
THAT'S TRUE BASICALLY THE

02:29:10.741 --> 02:29:11.742
FORMULA IS THE KEY ISSUE.

02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:15.379
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT THESE

02:29:15.446 --> 02:29:17.315
TYPES OF PROJECTS.

02:29:17.381 --> 02:29:20.351
SHOULD BE MORE PROPERLY HANDLED.

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:22.253
AT THE LOCAL THE LOCAL

02:29:22.320 --> 02:29:23.187
GOVERNMENT OR THE REGIONAL

02:29:23.254 --> 02:29:24.755
GOVERNMENT LEVEL.

02:29:24.822 --> 02:29:26.057
BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THE TYPE

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:27.458
OF PROJECTS.

02:29:27.525 --> 02:29:29.360
THAT OF REGIONAL LOCAL

02:29:29.427 --> 02:29:31.696
GOVERNMENTS DO THAT'S

02:29:31.762 --> 02:29:32.330
ESSENTIALLY WHY AGAIN OR JUST

02:29:32.396 --> 02:29:33.097
THE BILL.

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:33.998
I DON'T THINK THE STATE

02:29:34.065 --> 02:29:35.333
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION I'LL

02:29:35.399 --> 02:29:37.735
BE LOOKING AT SMALL BICYCLE

02:29:37.802 --> 02:29:38.703
PATHS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:42.640
THAT'S KIND OF NOT THE ROLE IT

02:29:42.707 --> 02:29:45.409
WAS NEVER THEIR INTENTION AND SP

02:29:45.476 --> 02:29:46.477
ONE TO HAVE THEM.

02:29:46.544 --> 02:29:47.678
GO TO THIS.

02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:49.980
MASSIVE EFFORT TO DO ALL THIS

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:52.283
AND HIRE MORE STAFF AND ROCK

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:53.617
PROCEED TO THE CURRENT.

02:29:53.684 --> 02:29:54.618
THAT KIND OF THING IS MORE

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:57.722
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THE THE

02:29:57.788 --> 02:29:59.557
LOCAL STEWART SO BUT WE WANT TO

02:29:59.623 --> 02:30:01.926
HAVE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM.

02:30:01.992 --> 02:30:07.398
A A REGIONAL PROGRAM AND A SMALL.

02:30:07.465 --> 02:30:09.934
A RURAL CITY PROGRAM -- ON ALSO

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:11.635
SAY THAT I'M.

02:30:11.702 --> 02:30:13.337
EXTREMELY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:30:13.404 --> 02:30:14.739
DISADVANTAGE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I

02:30:14.805 --> 02:30:16.540
THINK THIS IS A TRUE STATEMENT

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:18.376
PEOPLE MAY TO WE HAVE.

02:30:18.442 --> 02:30:18.909
TO APPROACH THIS FROM THE

02:30:18.976 --> 02:30:19.977
STANDPOINT.

02:30:20.044 --> 02:30:22.813
THAT -- SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:24.582
NOT RECEIVED THEIR ADEQUATE

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:28.352
SHARE OF SUPPORT -- FOR WALKWAYS

02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:29.954
SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL.

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:32.390
BIKE WAYS PATHWAYS AND WE SHOULD

02:30:32.456 --> 02:30:34.492
NEVER HURTS PROMOTE THAT.

02:30:34.558 --> 02:30:36.093
YEAH -- IN OUR DISCUSSIONS NOT

AND JUST TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT'S

02:30:40.598 --> 02:30:41.265
BEEN HAPPENING IN THE

DESCRIBES THE ATP PROGRAM.

02:33:04.775 --> 02:33:07.378

02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:34.271
THINK THE ALLOCATED TWO HUNDRED

02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:35.873
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.575
SO YOU GET HOW IT.

02:33:37.641 --> 02:33:41.579
THIS PROGRAM GREW -- WHEN THE

02:33:41.645 --> 02:33:44.915
PROGRAM GREW -- THE STATE

02:33:44.982 --> 02:33:47.484
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.

02:33:47.551 --> 02:33:49.153
A DECISION THAT [inaudible]

02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:51.188
BASICALLY.

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:54.692
ALLOCATED SOME MONEY -- FOR THE

02:33:54.758 --> 02:33:56.860
REGIONAL [inaudible]

02:33:56.927 --> 02:33:58.662
TRANSPORTATION PLANS THAT ARE

02:33:58.729 --> 02:34:06.136
INCLUDING -- WALKWAYS BIKE WAYS

02:34:06.203 --> 02:34:06.437
[inaudible]

02:34:06.503 --> 02:34:07.905
ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION.

02:34:07.972 --> 02:34:10.140
AND THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.675
PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THAT

02:34:11.742 --> 02:34:13.143
IN THE REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION

02:34:13.210 --> 02:34:15.613
PLAN. TO REDUCE -- THE

02:34:15.679 --> 02:34:17.047
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN

02:34:17.114 --> 02:34:20.884
ACCORDANCE WITH -- SB YOUTH

02:34:20.951 --> 02:34:21.518
THREE SEVENTY FIVE OKAY SO THEY

02:34:21.585 --> 02:34:22.553
HAVE TO HAVE.

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.488
THIS AIR QUALITY ELEMENT BIKE

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:27.157
WAYS PATHWAYS AND SO FORTH IN

02:34:27.224 --> 02:34:28.926
ADDITION TO SAY FROM SCHOOL.

02:34:28.993 --> 02:34:30.394
SHOULD BE INCLUDED.

02:34:30.461 --> 02:34:33.597
SO -- THE REGIONAL PLANS

02:34:33.664 --> 02:34:36.200
ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC.

02:34:36.266 --> 02:34:38.702
MANDATE. TO LOOK AT AIR QUALITY

02:34:38.769 --> 02:34:41.739
TO LOOK AT OF PLANNING OF

02:34:41.805 --> 02:34:43.774
ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION TO DO

02:34:43.841 --> 02:34:46.243
A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. TO

02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:47.945
COORDINATE WITH THE REGIONAL AIR

02:34:48.012 --> 02:34:50.414
QUALITY BOARDS -- AS WELL AS THE

02:34:50.481 --> 02:34:53.150
LOCAL COUNTY EACH COUNTY HAS --

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:54.885
CONGESTION MANAGEMENT AGENCY AND

02:34:54.952 --> 02:34:57.588
THEY HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE AND DO A

02:34:57.655 --> 02:34:59.256
LOCAL PLAN TO DO THE SAME EXACT

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:00.524
THING.

02:35:00.591 --> 02:35:03.761
SO I THINK THAT FOR ME -- THE

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:05.462
PLANNING PROCESS IS MORE

02:35:05.529 --> 02:35:06.730
STRUCTURED.

02:35:06.797 --> 02:35:11.135
IT'S MORE. FIVE SET UP TO MEET

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:13.437
CERTAIN GOALS.

02:35:13.504 --> 02:35:16.740
OF ITS -- BY STATUTE BY

02:35:16.807 --> 02:35:19.610
LEGISLATIVE STATUTE AS OPPOSED

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:21.178
TO THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION

02:35:21.245 --> 02:35:22.980
COMMISSION COMING UP WITH A

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:25.382
BUNCH OF CRITERIA WHICH THEY DID.

02:35:25.449 --> 02:35:26.050
LIKE.

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:27.751
SEVERAL PAGES LONG.

02:35:27.818 --> 02:35:30.721
OF HOW TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDS.

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:31.622
SO THEY CAME UP WITH THIS

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:34.425
CRITERIA THEN THEY CREATED THESE --

02:35:34.491 --> 02:35:36.360
TEAMS OF EVALUATORS AND

02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:38.362
EVALUATORS WERE VOLUNTEERS AND

02:35:38.429 --> 02:35:39.930
THE VOLUNTEERS EVALUATE THE

02:35:39.997 --> 02:35:40.964
PROJECTS.

02:35:41.031 --> 02:35:42.766
AND THEN THEY CAME UP WITH THE

02:35:42.833 --> 02:35:44.935
ALLOCATION OF THE TWO HUNDRED

02:35:45.002 --> 02:35:46.770
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS.

02:35:46.837 --> 02:35:49.073
SO FOR ME I THINK A MORE

02:35:49.139 --> 02:35:49.373
[inaudible]

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:52.776
STRUCTURED PROFESSIONAL --

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:55.713
PUBLIC INPUT WISE -- THE

02:35:55.779 --> 02:35:57.448
REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNING

02:35:57.514 --> 02:36:01.919
PROCESS IS A VERY INVOLVED.

02:36:01.985 --> 02:36:03.687
TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC PROCESS

02:36:03.754 --> 02:36:05.422
THERE'S A LOT OF DEBATE THERE'S

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:06.323
PLENTY OF MEETINGS WE ALL KNOW

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:07.825
THAT.

02:36:07.891 --> 02:36:09.560
AND I THINK THAT'S A MUCH BETTER

02:36:09.626 --> 02:36:13.530
WAY OF DOING THIS FOR THESE

02:36:13.597 --> 02:36:15.799
TYPES OF PROJECTS.

02:36:15.866 --> 02:36:19.470
HOWEVER THE THE BILL DOES NOT.

02:36:19.536 --> 02:36:23.006
TAKE AWAY ALL THE FUNDS -- FOR

02:36:23.073 --> 02:36:24.575
THE STATE IT LEAVES A

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:25.809
SIGNIFICANT PART OF MONEY FOR

02:36:25.876 --> 02:36:28.879
THE STATE. TO ALLOCATE TO THE

02:36:28.946 --> 02:36:30.748
PROJECTS SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER

02:36:30.814 --> 02:36:32.616
REQUIRES TALKING ABOUT OR OTHER

02:36:32.683 --> 02:36:33.584
STATEWIDE.

02:36:33.650 --> 02:36:36.887
PROJECTS OR OTHER PROJECTS THAT.

02:36:36.954 --> 02:36:39.556
MAYBE HELP BALANCE THE THE

02:36:39.623 --> 02:36:42.993
DESIRES OF COMMUNITIES TO HAVE A

02:36:43.060 --> 02:36:44.528
LARGER SKILL [inaudible]

02:36:44.595 --> 02:36:46.363
LARGER PROJECTS.

02:36:46.430 --> 02:36:49.032
SO I I BELIEVE THAT THE SIZE OF

02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:49.933
THESE PROJECTS THE PLANNING

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.835
PROCESS THAT WE HAVE AT THE

02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:52.402
LOCAL LEVEL AND THE REGIONAL

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:53.504
LEVEL.

02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:56.440
IS MUCH MORE STRUCTURED MORE.

02:36:56.507 --> 02:37:00.110
MORE PUBLIC PROCESS ORIENTED.

02:37:00.177 --> 02:37:01.779
MORE PROFESSIONAL.

02:37:01.845 --> 02:37:04.782
THEN -- THE PROCESS USE NOW AT

02:37:04.848 --> 02:37:06.550
THE STATEWIDE LEVEL SO.

02:37:06.617 --> 02:37:08.118
THAT'S WHY I'VE I'VE INTRODUCED

02:37:08.185 --> 02:37:09.153
A BILL.

02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:11.922

ABOUT -- SOMEBODY -- IN TERMS OF

02:52:59.135 --> 02:53:00.136
AFFORDABILITY.

02:53:00.203 --> 02:53:01.571
THERE'S A REASON WHY IF WE GO

02:53:01.637 --> 02:53:03.206
WITH THE GOVERNOR'S CREDIT CARD

02:53:03.272 --> 02:53:04.640
IDEA WE CAN.

02:53:04.707 --> 02:53:08.177
HAVE PEOPLE PAY THE MONTHLY.

02:53:08.244 --> 02:53:10.146

OPTIONS I THINK.

02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:19.455
I THINK WE OUGHT TO LOOK AT THE

02:53:19.522 --> 02:53:20.656
FEASIBILITY OF ALL THAT KIND OF

02:53:20.723 --> 02:53:24.627

WORKING WITH MY COMMITTEE

02:53:27.396 --> 02:53:28.264

02:53:45.915 --> 02:53:47.950
I THINK THIS COULD WORK VERY

02:53:48.017 --> 02:53:49.619
WELL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I

02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:51.821
THINK THAT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:53.990
COMPLAINTS NOT THINK THIS IS ONE

02:53:54.056 --> 02:53:54.590

02:53:58.728 --> 02:54:00.396
THE FACT THAT.

02:54:00.463 --> 02:54:02.799
THE REGISTRATION BILL SHOWS UP

02:54:02.865 --> 02:54:03.633
AND YOU HAVE TO PAY IT ALL AT

02:54:03.699 --> 02:54:06.102
ONCE AND FOR MANY PEOPLE THEY

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:08.638
DON'T HAVE THAT.

02:54:08.704 --> 02:54:11.741

FACES THAT WE HAVE SET UP TO BE

PAID AT ONCE SO WHEN WE SEE

02:54:36.265 --> 02:54:37.767
PEOPLE THAT DON'T REGISTER THEIR

02:54:37.834 --> 02:54:40.336

02:54:51.214 --> 02:54:53.115
THAT A TWO YEAR REGISTRATION

02:54:53.182 --> 02:54:55.718
WOULD BE ABLE TO BE PAID IN

02:54:55.785 --> 02:54:57.954
INSTALLMENTS THAT WAY REGARDLESS

02:54:58.020 --> 02:54:59.288
OF WHETHER THIS CREDIT CARD

THING HAPPENS OR NOT AT LEAST WE

02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:03.993
WOULD HAVE A PROVISION.

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:06.195
FOR THESE -- FOR MONTHLY OR

02:55:06.262 --> 02:55:07.563
OTHER PAYMENTS.

02:55:07.630 --> 02:55:09.398
BECAUSE THEN IT WOULD BE CREATES

02:55:09.465 --> 02:55:10.533
LESS OF A HARDSHIP FOR FOR AYE

02:55:10.600 --> 02:55:12.134
AYE I'M WILLING TO LOOK AT ALL

02:55:12.201 --> 02:55:13.936

YES -- AND LET'S PUT THAT IN.

ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE CREDIT

02:55:24.313 --> 02:55:25.681
CARD IDEA OF JUST PUTTING ON

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:27.950
YOUR CREDIT CARD -- DOES IT

02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:29.919

FOR DMV I DON'T KNOW LET'S FIND

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:35.091
OUT RIGHT -- LET'S SEE HOW WE

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:37.827
CAN GO ABOUT DOING IT WITHOUT --

02:55:37.894 --> 02:55:40.162
IMPEDING DMV.

02:55:40.229 --> 02:55:42.098
FOR DOING THEIR JOB I THINK.

02:55:42.164 --> 02:55:43.566
I THINK TO ALL THOSE IDEAS ARE

02:55:43.633 --> 02:55:45.201
GOOD THERE'S OTHER IDEAS --

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:47.336
PEOPLE HAVE LIKE.

02:55:47.403 --> 02:55:49.472
WHEN YOU DO YOUR -- SMOG CHECK

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:51.107
YOU CAN PAY YOUR DMV FEES AT THE

02:55:51.173 --> 02:55:53.075
SAME TIME LIKE IN ABOUT -- THE

02:55:53.142 --> 02:55:55.244
THE WALK AND YOU DRIVE A CAR IN

02:55:55.311 --> 02:55:56.879
A SMOG CHECK STATION.

02:55:56.946 --> 02:55:57.780
AND THEN YOU GET YOUR SMOG CHECK

02:55:57.847 --> 02:56:00.883
YOU GET THE CERTIFICATION.

02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:02.251
IN NEVADA AND THEN THE GUY SAYS

02:56:02.318 --> 02:56:04.921
SO YOU WANT TO PAY YOUR DMV SIR.

02:56:04.987 --> 02:56:06.355
THANKS AND YOU MIGHT SAY YEAH

02:56:06.422 --> 02:56:08.224
COURSE IN AND SO HE ADDS IT TO

02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:09.558
THE SMOG CHECK BILL GOES ON A

02:56:09.625 --> 02:56:10.960
CREDIT CARD.

02:56:11.027 --> 02:56:13.229
SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND

02:56:13.296 --> 02:56:16.866
OF THOSE KIND OF IDEAS -- I

02:56:16.933 --> 02:56:18.367
THINK ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF IS

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:20.169
SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:22.571
THERE'S OTHER AYE AYE THINGS

02:56:22.638 --> 02:56:23.139
THAT ARE HAPPENING IN OTHER

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:26.943
STATES -- I KNOW THAT WE ARE

02:56:27.009 --> 02:56:30.680
LIMITED BY OUR TECHNOLOGY A DMV.

02:56:30.746 --> 02:56:31.681
WE CERTAINLY THAT HAVE A LOT OF

02:56:31.747 --> 02:56:33.582
ARM SO WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH

02:56:33.649 --> 02:56:34.984
THAT OR COME THAT ISSUE IF WE

02:56:35.051 --> 02:56:36.919
WERE ALLOWING FOR PAYMENT OVER

02:56:36.986 --> 02:56:39.388
TIME CERTAINLY THE DMV COULD

02:56:39.455 --> 02:56:41.090
ALLOW ANOTHER ONE OF OUR STATE

02:56:41.157 --> 02:56:43.793
AGENCIES THAT ARE ALREADY SET UP.

02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:45.628
FOR SUCH PAYMENTS TO ADMINISTER

02:56:45.695 --> 02:56:47.096
THAT PAYMENT BUT WHAT I THINK

02:56:47.163 --> 02:56:49.598
WHAT ONE OF OUR OBJECTIVES IS IS

02:56:49.665 --> 02:56:50.466
TO HAVE.

02:56:50.533 --> 02:56:52.868
THE DMV BEAM A MUCH MORE

02:56:52.935 --> 02:56:56.272

EXPLORATION -- SO.

02:57:07.083 --> 02:57:08.818
