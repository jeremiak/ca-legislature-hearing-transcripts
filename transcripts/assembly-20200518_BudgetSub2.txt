THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL FROM OUR- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LA L. JUST SOME INTRO COMMENTS BEFORE WE HEAR FROM. THE LA OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IT'S A HISTORIC TIME I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE REMEMBER IT AS A FAVORABLE THE START TIME I'M SURE SOMETHING THAT NO ONE'S GONNA FORGET NON OUR KIDS ARE NEVER GOING TO FORGET THAT. COVERED NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY- THIS IS ERA DISTANCE LEARNING HAS HAS WORKED FOR SOME KIDS IN SOME FAMILIES AND NOT WILL NOT WELL FOR OTHERS AND- WE KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A REALITY CHECK FOR MANY. FAMILIES AND KIDS WHO ARE BEHIND AND WHO OF MAYBE ALREADY BEEN BEHIND IT ARE STILL BEHIND SET SOMETHING WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT AS WE- FINALIZE OUR OUR BUDGET TODAY. WE KNOW THAT PARENTS ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA ARE WORKING EXTRA HARD RIGHT NOW AS OUR TEACHERS.

MANY PLANS DíAS SURE THERE SO STORE WITH THEIR- OR THEIR THEIR FAMILY. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CRACKS A KIDS FALLING THROUGH AND SO ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WE HEAR TODAY FOR THAT. DISTANCE LEARNING. SOME AS WELL AS FOCUSING ON THE LEARNING LOSS- REALITIES THROUGHOUT OUR- SCHOOL SYSTEM OF SIX MILLION CALIFORNIA KIDS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW THE BIG ISSUE WE HAVE TO FACE IS THE REVENUE PIECE I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS- IS SOMEHOW PER TRAINING THIS IS HOLDING SCHOOLS HARMLESS AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK AS FAR AS WHAT THAT MEANS BECAUSE- WE OPEN UP OR SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW SCHOOLS AND A MASTERS IN TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE ASKED TO DO MORE. ESSENTIALLY WOULD LAST AND THEY'RE GONNA BE TRANSFORM TO BOTH TEACHERS AS WELL AS FIRST RESPONDERS AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE. A TOUGH CONVERSATION AS FAR AS WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS. WE KNOW THAT THIS BUDGET IS PREDICATED ON HAVING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A REALITY CHECK ON WHAT THAT MEANS AS WELL AND IF THAT DOESN'T COME THROUGH. WHAT IS TRIGGER- CATS- WILL MEAN FOR CALIFORNIA IN OUR SCHOOLS FOR OUR QUE SCHOOLS WELL AS EARLY EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA AND- AND ONE THING WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP ASKING OURSELVES IS AND THIS IS TO THE GOVERNOR AND EVERYBODY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHAT'S OUR PLAN B. I KNOW THE LEADERS IN IN THE U. S. SENATE. ARE NOT TO OP ARE NOT TO- EXCITED ABOUT HAVING. A SECOND ROUND OF MONEY'S GOING OUT TO STATES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND WORK COUNTING ON THIS TO BALANCE OUR STATE BUDGET BUT IF THAT. DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT'S OUR PLAN B. AS FAR AS ADDITIONAL REVENUES THAT MEAN. AND THE BALLOT MEASURES FOR TAXES I MEAN. WE DID DURING THE SORTS **** MINISTRATION A DEFICIT REVENUE BOND- THE BOTTOM LINE IS. HAVING THESE- CONEY THAT'S TO OUR LOOK AT PATIENTS GEN. FOR IT CAMPER CAN RECOVERY WE NEED REAL. TAKE DEBT ON THOSE. WELL AT. I'M NOT. TALKING TODAY IN WITH THAT. WE WILL BE. TO HEARING. OKAY SO I JUST BASED OFF LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN SO I'M BEING TOLD WE'RE HAVING A TECHNICAL BREAK DOWN ON SOON WE NEED TO PAUSE THE HEARING UNTIL THE ISSUE IS RESOLVED. SO WERE THINKING IT'S GOING TO BE A FIVE MINUTE TIME OUT. OKAY SO WE WILL. THAT WILL TAKE A BREAK FOR A FEW MINUTES OKAY. WE'RE TESTING OR NOT BACK ALIVE AGAIN WE'RE JUST DOING A TEST TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EQUIPMENT IS WORKING. TEST TEST TEST. ALL GOOD. OTHER HELLO EIGHTEEN T.

LIMóN MEDINA MURATSUCHI O'DONNELL. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO. HAVE A LITTLE IT OF A DIFFERENT- PRACTICE HERE WITH THESE HEARINGS AS OPPOSED TO PRIOR YEARS TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS- WE DON'T HAVE AN AGENDA OF LISTED ITEMS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. THE LA- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COVERT GO OVER THE ENTIRE IN THE REVISED PROPOSALS AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THE PHONE- PARTICIPATING IN THE FUN. AT THE DIVERSITY ACTION IS IN THE SAME ROOM WITH OKAY THEY ARE HERE AS WELL- TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS WELL. AND THEN WE WILL HAVE THE MEMBERS ENGAGE ON THE K. TWELVE ISSUES- AND THEN WE'LL GET TO THAT EARLY EDUCATION CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL PIECE- NEXT WITH THAT WE'RE GONNA ASK EDGAR CABRAL WITH THE LA GO TO WALK THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND MAYBE AS BUDGET FOR THIS. GOOD AFTERNOON- THE TERM MEMBER OF THE GROUP OF ALTERNATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WOULD BE A- LOT. IF CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN GO AHEAD AT HER. YES THERE ARE THERE WAS A HAND OUT WE PARTICULAR HANDOUT THAT I BELIEVE I WILL SHARE WITH YOU ALL I'M THAT I USED TO GO OVER THE MAJOR ELEMENTS OF THE NAY REVISION FOR KIDS OFTEN EARLY EDUCATION. AND OF OUR OUR BOTH OUR PART WITH OUR K. TWELVE COMMENTS IN A POP AND THEN. PROCEED OUT GET EDGAR COULD YOU JUST ONE SECOND WE CAN'T HEAR YOU TO ALSO NOT SURE IF IT'S YOU AND YOUR MIKE OR IF IT'S US THE TO TURN IT UP SO CAN YOU. THEY BIGELOW CLOSER. AS WELL. YEAH I MEAN IT LOOKS. OKAY OUT HOW THE RIGHT NOW. A LITTLE BETTER. WHAT WILL ASK THAT WE ADJUST THE VOLUME AS WELL GO AHEAD. OKAY GREAT SO- I WILL BEGIN WALKING THROUGH THE HAND OUT ON COVERING THE K. TWELVE EDUCATION ISSUES FIRST- MOVING ON THE ON- PAGE ONE WE HAVE. I JUST FIRST THE OVERALL CHANGES IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO GIVE YOU SOME- BIG PICTURE SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON FROM JANUARY TO MAY REVISION- SO YOU CAN SEE ON ON PAGE WHAT WE HAVE A CHART KASHER SHOWING THE JANUARY FUNDING LEVELS POSTED THE MAYOR VERSION FROM THE LEVEL. OVERALL THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED DOWN SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE NIGHT. AT AT YOUR YOU TIME I REAL. WHERE WERE HAVE. SOME CHALLENGES WITH THE AUDIO. HAVE OF PAPER OR SOMETHING LIKE TALKING. YEAH. IS THERE ANY BETTER NOW MUCH BETTER. OKAY I SEE OKAY I THINK AN OLD SCRIPT OKAY YEAH THERE WAS THERE WAS A FOR THE GOT STRUCK THE OKAY. BETTER NOW YEP PERFECT GO HEAD OKAY. OKAY SO I'M ARE JUST AGAIN ON PAGE ONE WE WALKED THROUGH THE THERE ARE SEVENTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS- IN OUR CHANGES IN THE REVISION OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD BUT THEN THE BUDGET- MOST OF THAT IS IN THE IS IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND THIS IS DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE PRIMARILY- GIVEN THAT THE STATE NOW HAS ENTERED INTO A RECESSION. THE I WOULD KNOW ALSO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- MAY REVISION INCLUDES BOUT FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW REVENUES SO THOSE ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE ABSENT THOSE REVENUES TO GUARANTEE WOULD BE EVEN LOWER. SO THAT THAT'S THE OVERALL PROP NINETY EIGHT NUMBERS- I KNOW YOU'LL TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY COLLEGES TOMORROW IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION HEARING. SO WHAT WILL FOCUS ON THE K. TWELVE- SPENDING LEVEL RIGHT NOW- PROP NINETY FUNDING IT DOWN FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- MOST OF THAT TWELVE BILLION IS IN OUR IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THAT'S THOSE ARE VERY BIG REDUCTIONS YEAR OVER YEAR- AMONG THE BIGGER REDUCTION PROBABLY THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET- THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS OUTSIDE OF PROP NINETY. THAT ARE- AFFECTING SCHOOL FUNDING AND SO- I DID WANT TO TALK% ABOUT SOME OF THOSE TO GIVE A BIGGER PICTURE SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON- THERE ARE- A COUPLE MERE VISION SOME OF THE REDUCTIONS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. THE FIRST IS THAT. THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL FEDERAL FUNDING THOSE FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THAT ARM WILL BE PROVIDED TO. OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HELP ME TO GET SOMEBODY'S REDUCTIONS. ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION OF THOSE ARE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IF FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH A FORMULA AND THIS IS ONE OF THE MANY PARTS OF FUNDING THAT WERE IN THE FEDERAL. EXACT THIS IS WHAT AT THE TO BE BECOME A PROBLEM FOR ME ALSO THERE'S NOT A LOT OF IF THEY CAN DO TO CONTROL IT. ON THIS IS FUNDING THAT THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING ARE BASED ON THAT FEDERAL- FEDERAL LAW. BUT THE REMAINING ARM FUNDING THAT'S IN THE MIRROR VISION IS THE- CHOICE BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE THESE. OF A FIVE TO SCHOOL DOUBLE TALK ABOUT THOSE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL LATER. RIGHT PROGRAMMATIC CUTS THERE ARE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN PAYMENT DEFERRALS AND- WHEN THESE ARE IMPLEMENTED FOR SCHOOL THE TYPICALLY MEANS THAT THEY- CAN GO BORROW OR IF THEY HAVE CASH ON HAND THEY COULD COVER THEIR COSTS. I'M IN THE SHORT RUN WALL THEY'RE WAITING FOR IT. TO COME BUT THEY'VE TYPICALLY NOT RESULTED IN A FAIRLY- A PROGRAMMATIC CUTS TO SCHOOLS. ON PAGE THREE HERE WE HAVE A CHART THAT KIND OF. PUT ALL THOSE THINGS TOGETHER IT SHOWS YOU WHAT OVERALL FUNDING IS FROM YEAR TO YEAR. WHEN YOU CONSIDER THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES FUNDING IS ROUGHLY FLAT- FOR OUR KIDS OVER THE KITCHEN IF YOU IF YOU INCLUDE THOSE OTHER PARTS OF FUNDING. AND ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. PAYMENT DEFERRALS. I'M THE OTHER THING THAT THAT WE WERE NOTED THAT THERE IS A ANOTHER MAJOR NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND PROPOSAL. ON RELATED. RELATED TO PENSION READY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THIS IS NOT. THE NEW AUGMENTATION TO FOODS ARE TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT- THIS WAS IN AN- INTENSELY. ARE ARE INITIALLY INTENDED TO BE A SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATION. I WAS GONNA GO TOWARDS PAYING DOWN- THE LONG TERM UNFUNDED LIABILITIES FOR THE PENSION SYSTEMS. WHICH WOULD REDUCE ALL OVER A TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD- CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES. INSTEAD THE PROPOSAL TO TAKE BOTH FUNDAMENT THAT- PROVIDE THOSE FUNDS ARE. TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR OUR- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO CONTRIBUTION RATES WOULD BE DECREASING AS A RESULT. SO THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU THE OVERALL BIG PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON- MUCH MORE THAN WHAT GRANTED PROP NINETY EIGHT- I DON'T WANT TO WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE MAJOR PROBLEM ANY CHANGES JUST SO THAT YOU HAVE A- SENSE OF WHAT THOSE- THOSE BIG MOVIE PIECES ARE- FIRST. THE ADMINISTRATION KRISTEN'S ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN AUGMENTATIONS EVER PROVOKE PROPOSED IN JANUARY. MOST OF THOSE WERE ONE TIME- PROPOSALS FROM RELATED TO EDUCATE YOUR EDUCATION WORKFORCE INITIATIVES OTHERS- RELATED TO ADDRESSING THE JAMAICA. ONE NOTABLE PROPOSAL BUT STILL IN THE MERE VISION IS SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO INCREASE THE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RIGHTS. THE MAIN REASON ALSO INCLUDES A SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION TO THE HEALTHY PFAFF- THIS IS- A 10% ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION SO ACT- EVERY DISTRICTS OF THE IF OF OUR KITCHEN WITH DECREASED BY ABOUT 10% AMOUNT- ENTIRELY CONSIST OF TWO PARTS ONE PIECE OF THAT IS ACTUALLY. ARE JUST NOT PROVIDING THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IT'S REQUIRED UNDER STATUTE AND THEN THE REST WOULD BE ARE A REDUCTION THAT'S BEYOND THE CURRENT ARE NINETEEN TWENTY LEVELS. I'M THEN THERE ARE THE PAYMENT TO FOR ALL THAT I DISCUSSED EARLIER THEY ADD UP TO FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN UNDER SOME REDUCTIONS THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS. THAT THE TWO MOST NOTABLE THERE ARE REDUCTIONS TO. THE CORRECT TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TOTALING HUNDRED MILLION THIS IS CUTTING THOSE PROGRAMS BY ROUGHLY HALF. I'M AMANDA REDUCTION TO THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION FIFTY PROGRAM BY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WOULD BRING IT DOWN TO THE MINIMUM UP IT'S REQUIRED. BY STATUTE- AS AS WAS THAT AND ACTED IN PROPOSITION FORTY NINE. ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMMATIC REDUCTIONS ARE OUR- ARE ARE. SUBJECT TO THESE WHICH TRIGGERED LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THE MAYOR VISION AND IT'S IN VARIOUS PARTS OF BURKE. ARE A VERY. DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE BUDGET- SUCH THAT IF THERE WAS ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. ARE PROVIDED THEM THESE CUTS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY OCCUR. THE BALLOT THAT APPLIES TO THE CITY PROGRAMS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND TO BE A FIFTH OF PRODUCTION NOT THE PAYMENT FOR. ON THE NEXT PAGE- WE COVER- THE ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED- THAT THE FIRST- BIGGEST PART OF FUNDING IS FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THAT'S FOR LEARNING LOST MEDICATION. AND THIS IS- COME FROM TWO SOURCES- TWO DIFFERENT FUNDS IN THE CARRIAGE ACT LEGISLATION ITSELF THERE'S FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CROWN OF OURS RELIEF FUND. THIS IS- THAT THAT PROVIDES RELIEF FUND THE STATE IS RECEIVING NINE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS- OF FOUR UP FROM FROM THE FUNDING THE FUNDS YOU TO BE USED BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CHOSEN TO PROVIDE FOR ABOUT NINE POINT FOUR BILLION TO SCHOOLS. FROM THE OTHER- EIGHT. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY. THE EDUCATION FUND THIS IS A PART OF FUNDING WAS. THAT THE STATE HAS TECH YOU CAN FOR KIDS OR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THE MANY REVIEWS. ARE PROVIDES ALL OF IT SCHOOLS THIS ARE LEARNING OFF MEDICATION PROPOSAL. THE FUNDING FOR A- BURNING LOVE MEDICATION WILL BE DISTRIBUTED- ACCORDING TO TWO DIFFERENT COMPONENTS ONE. AT TO PROVIDE OUR IS IT IS A FORM THAT'S PROVIDED BASED ON WHETHER OR NOT A DISTRICT RECEIVES A FEE IF OF CONCENTRATION GRANTS SO. IF YOU GET OF THE IF OF CONCENTRATION GRANTS BUT YOU WOULD GET A FOR PEOPLE AMOUNT FOR ALL OF YOUR STUDENTS- AND THAT'S A TWO POINT NINE BILLION OUT OF THE FOUR POINT FOUR. THEN THERE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THAT IS DISTRICTS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. CAN BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT- DIRECTLY HELP WITH- IMPROVING STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT OR MITIGATING LEARNING LOSS DUE TO SCHOOL CLOSURES- AS A RESULT OF THE OUT OF THE COMA NINETEEN A BREAK. ARE MET AND AS A RESULT SCHOOL CLOSURES- DARK. THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT DISTRICTS CAN SPEND IT IT CAN BE TO EXTEND THE SCHOOL YEAR- TO PROVIDE MORE AND SERVICES TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC SUPPORT- IT WOULD BE UP TO OUR VALUES TO DECIDE. THEY DO JUST HAVE TO- ADOPTEE. COUNTY AND INSTRUCTIONAL CONTINUITY PLAN THAT DESCRIBES HOW THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE FUNDS. HOW INSURE THAT DEVICES ALSO COULD HAVE DID NOT DEVICES THE CONNECTIVITY AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE ACTIONS. SO THAT'S THE BIGGEST PART OF FUNDING THE NEXT THERE THERE IS ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. ONE TIME FUNDING THAT WAS ALSO IN THE CARRIAGE ACT ONE POINT- ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS THE- THE SOURCE I MENTIONED EARLIER TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY FORMULA BE FROM THE FEDERAL TITLE ONE FORMULA. I'M DOUBLE GOAL TO SCHOOLS DIRECTLY AND THEN THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS OUR- OF THE LEGISLATION ALLOWS STATES TO KEEP UP 210% OF THIS FUNDING- SO THAT IT COULD BE USED FOR SOME STATE LEVEL ACTIVITIES IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEAR VISION. INCLUDES SOME OF PROPOSALS FOR USING NOT FIND THE BIGGEST IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANT. AND THEN THERE'S ABOUT SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE FOR READY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. ONE OTHER PIECE THAT IN THE MERE VISION IS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- IN ONETIME CHILD NUTRITION FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I WOULD POINT OUT HERE THAT THIS IS A FINDING THAT THERE IS VIRTUALLY NO GUIDANCE FROM- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS TO HOW THIS FUNDING CAN BE SPENT SO AT THIS POINT IT'S UNCLEAR. WHAT EXACTLY THE FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR BUT THE MERE BUSINESS INCLUDE THE APPROPRIATION OF FORTY FOUR HOLES FUNDS. SUCH THAT IF THE STATE WERE TO GET GUIDANCE THAT THAT THE MONEY COULD BE DISTRIBUTED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR. WE GOT TO THE NEXT AGE TO PAGE SIX- I DID ARM. ON TALK ABOUT THIS IS A MULTI OR A- FUTURE YOUR ISSUE THIS IS NOT RELATED TO THE BUT YEAR BUT THERE IS SOME. ARE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT PROPOSES TO MAKE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN FUTURE YEARS- THIS WILL CREATE A MULTI YOUR OBLIGATION. TO PAY THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS- TO SCHOOLS COMMUNITY COLLEGES ABOUT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- GUARANTEE. AND IT WOULD BE- THE WAY THAT THOSE. PAYMENTS WOULD BE MADE AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE STATE WOULD PROVIDE A ONE POINT 5% OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES- AND THEY COULD BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE AFFECT. OUR PROP NINETY FUNDING ISSUES RIGHT NOW. I'M IN THE LONG RUN AND THE STATE WOULD INCREASE THE STATE- BUT SHARE OF GENERAL FUND. THAT GOES TO OUR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE TO SCHOOL THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES FROM THIRTY PERCENT. TO FORTY PERCENT- SO RIGHT. WE TALK ABOUT OFTEN PROP INDEED IT BEING- 40% OF GENERAL REVENUES. IN REALITY BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF SHIFT THAT WE- NEED- RELATED PROPERTY TAXES. IT'S ACTUALLY THAT'S ABOUT A TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON GO ON GOING INCREASE- TO THE PROPERTY PLEASE. I'M SUCH THE COVER OF OUR COME. ON OF PROPOSALS THE FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT THINK- MISTER CHAIR MENTIONED THIS A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS. THAT THE PACKAGE DOES NOT ADDRESS ANY A POSSIBILITY FOR SCHOOL CLOSURES OR POTENTIAL DELAYS IN THE SCHOOL YEAR- WHEN THE ACADEMIC YEAR OPENS AND WE THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT THE LEADS THAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS AND THAT HOPEFULLY END UP OF A BUDGET IN JUNE. WILL HAVE SOME GETTING TO SCHOOL DISTRICT ABOUT WITH WHAT IS TO OCCUR. WHEN THE- WHEN THE OUTBREAK OCCURRED SCHOOL STARTED TO CLOSE- THERE WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND LET LEGISLATURE DID IT PASSED SB ONE SEVENTEEN. WHICH ARE THERE A NUMBER OF THINGS TO PROVIDE- FISCAL CERTAINTY FOR DISTRICTS. IT ESSENTIALLY- HELD HARMLESS DISTRICTS- AFTER THEIR ATTENDANCE IN THIS YEAR BY STOPPING ATTENDANCE COUNTING AFTER FEBRUARY TWENTY NINTH. AND IT ALSO- ABOUT. SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO OFFER A- IT'S YEAR THAT WERE LEFT IN A NEEDED. AT ANIMAL. RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SCHOOL YEAR YOU ARE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES AND YOU LOSE SOME FUNDING. RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO PROPOSAL TO EXTEND THAT FLEXIBILITY. BUT ALSO NOTHING THAT BAD- REPLACES THEM WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. FOR PROVIDING FOR THE CERTAINTY TO DISTRICT BUT ALSO- BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO IF YOU'RE STARTING FROM- ACT MISSIONS FOR WHAT FUNDING WOULD BE TWELFTH OF THAT THE NEXT PETITIONS FOR WHAT STUDENT LEARNING WOULD BE IN THE EVENT OF CULTURES- BECAUSE THINGS HAPPEN SO FAST- IN MARCH WHEN WE MAKE THOSE CULTURES THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF CLARITY. ON SOME SPECIFIC AGENTS FOR OUR FOR SCHOOLS. NOW MOVES TO OUR NEXT A THIRD OF A COMMENTS RELATED TO THE CONTINUITY PLANS WE THINK THAT THIS. IS AN IS THERE A DISCONTINUITY PLAN TO BE A GOOD PLACE TO. SET SOME OF THOSE CORRECT PETITIONS. I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE CONTINUITY PLANS RIGHT NOW. SPECIFY HOW YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPEND THE FUNDING BUT WE WOULD- RECOMMEND YOU ADDING SOME MORE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS LIKE SUGGESTED WHAT IS THE PLAN. IF SCHOOLS WERE TO CLOSE- WHAT WOULD BE THE PLAN FOR ENSURING THAT THERE IS CONNECTIVITY FOR STUDENTS AT HOME- HOW WOULD- LEDS MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO BEST SERVE FOR EXAMPLE. A SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENT OR OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE. I'M I NEED AND- A LITTLE BIT MORE CHALLENGES AS WE- MOVE TO A DISTANCE LEARNING DURING THIS YEAR. A MEETING THAT THAT THIS WOULD BE A PLACE TO SET THE MODELS REQUIREMENTS. I'M THE OTHER THING WE HAVE SOME TIME FOR THE WAY THAT THAT FUNDING IS DISTRIBUTED. PATHETICALLY CONCENTRATION GRANT APPROACH- SO ON THE WAY THAT IT WORKS- CONSTRUCTION AND THRESHOLD IF THE- FIVE. YEARS. POPULATION BEING LOW INCOME OR- ORDER AND- THAT THIS ARE. FUNDING IS THIS IS IT'S A TO BE DISTRIBUTED. IN YOU GET FIFTY SIX PER. IF 6% YOUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH RESERVED INCOME. THEN AS OF. YOU WOULD GET PER PEEP. FUNDING AMOUNT. BECAUSE YOUR BONTA COME. THRESHOLD BUT IF YOU HAVE 53% OF YOUR STUDENTS WHO ARE- ENGLISHMEN AS OUR LOW INCOME YOU WILL GET NOTHING. AND WE THINK THAT CREATES TOO MUCH OF A- SORT OF A SORT OF A- EITHER OR EITHER YOU GET OUT. OF ARE A LOT OF FUNDING OR YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING AND WE THINK. OUR APPROACH TO PROVIDE A MORE SMOOTHER- FUNDING ACROSS DISTRICTS BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING A DIFFERENCE IS THE NEED IS TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDING BASED ON. THE PERCENTAGE OF A DISTRICTS POP- STATEWIDE CHAIR OF YELLOW AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. I'M A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE WOULD- JUST MENTIONED ONE IS THAT THERE YOU COULD PURSUE ADDITIONAL- BUT TARGETED REDUCTIONS ARM IN LIEU OF SOME OF THE- LARGER OFF THE FIFTH CUTS TO MITIGATE THOSE REDUCTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME ADAMS WITHIN THE HOUR THE FACT THAT ARE DISTRIBUTED- BASED ON HISTORICAL REASONS NOT FOR ANY CLEAR POLICY PURPOSES SUCH AS THE MINIMUM STEADY PROVISION- THAT ARE IF YOU WERE TO REDUCE THAT YOU. IF YOU COULD ELIMINATE THAT AND SAY NOT- HAVE AS BIG OF AN OFF THE IF A PRODUCTION. I'M THE OTHER THING THAT WE WITH A RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT PLAN. I THINK WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT- JUST LOCKING IN THE STATES ARE. A SPENDING AT THIS POINT- THERE'S NOTHING RIGHT NOW TO PREVENT THE LEGISLATURE FOR PROVIDING MORE FUNDING THAN THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE REQUIRES- WE WOULD WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE MESSAGE YOU WANT TO DO THAT. IT COULD IT COULD DO SO M. BUT I CAN MAKE THAT DECISION OF PART OF NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET TO THE- TO THE NORTH. EARLY ON THE SIDE AND- WITH STRUCTURE WOULD BE FOR THE NEXT OUR. THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SO THOSE ARE MY- COMMENTS ON KEYBOARD YOU. ALSO THE THIRTY FIRST. OKAY YOU WERE GOING TO HOLD ON. FROM YOU AT EDGAR AND ASKED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PRESENT AND GO OVER SOME OF THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. I AM HERE I'M NOT SURE IF I'M IF I'M SHOWING ON THE VIDEO SCREEN UP BUT THERE AND OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE LA- ALREADY COVERED AND SOME OF THE KEY TENANTS OF THE- GOVERNOR'S ME REVISION BUT OFTEN TOUCH ON A COUPLE OF THE KEY PIECES. THE ECONOMY HAS CHANGED DRASTICALLY SINCE THE GOVERNOR FIRST PUT OUT THE BUDGET IN JANUARY. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE MIDST OF AN UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC EMERGENCY AND A PACKAGE OF EDUCATION PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD AND THE MAJOR REVISION. REFLECT AND REFLECT THE FACT IN IS ALSO INTENDED TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING AT LEAST WITH THE FACT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITY FOR EDUCATION INCLUDE A STRONG FOCUS ON EQUITY FOR VULNERABLE STUDENTS. STABILITY OF CORE INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAMS. MITIGATING LEARNING MORE AND SUPPORTING SCHOOLS THROUGH THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. TO THIS END THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION PROPOSES A ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AS A RESULT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN SCHOOL CLOSURES. AT THE LA- MENTIONED BE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES INCLUDING X. AND EXTENDING THE INSTRUCTIONAL I'M HERE. PROVIDING ACADEMIC AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR PEOPLE PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS ARE DEVICES AND ACTIVITY FOR THE STUDENTS AS WELL. THE METHODOLOGY THAT THE LA DA ELLIE- DESCRIBED IS INTENDED TO TARGET- THESE FUNDS TOWARDS ALLEY ELEAZAR WOULD BE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. NAMELY THOSE- WITH LARGE POPULATIONS OF FOSTER YOUTH ENGLISH LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY CALIFORNIA RECEIVES ONE POINT SIX BILLION AND FEDERAL ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL EMERGENCY RELIEF FUNDS. OF THIS AMOUNT BASED ON TERROR TITLE ONE ALLOCATION. THE REMAINING 10% WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STATE LEVEL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING A HUNDRED MILLION FOR GRANTS TO COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. TO DEVELOP NETWORK THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND COORDINATE- HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS. SIXTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION FOR TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS AND OTHER SCHOOL PERSONNEL. AT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR STATE OPERATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLUB IN NINETEEN RESPONSE. AS NOTED IN THE ALEJO'S PRESENTATION THE REDUCTION IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEED WHEN COMBINED WITH THAT FOR A TECHNICAL CHANGES GREAT THE FUNDING FOR FALL OF FIFTEEN POINT ONE BILLION FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOL. OF OVER THREE PERIOD. A PARTIALLY ADDRESSED THE FOR ALL THE MAJOR VERSION PROPOSES TO WITHDRAW SEVERAL OF THE POLICY PROPOSAL FOR THE GOVERNOR PUT FORWARD IN JANUARY. ADDITIONALLY TO HELP DISTRICTS MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF FISCAL STABILITY DURING THIS TRYING TIME. THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES TO DEFER ONE POINT NINE BILLION IN PRINCIPLE OF FORTUNATE PAYMENTS FROM JUNE TWENTY NINETEEN TO JULY TWENTY TWENTY. AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IS ADDED TO THIS MOUNT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE POINT THREE BILLION AN APARTMENT THE PEARL SCHEDULED FOR PAYMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE BUDGETARY SHORTFALL AND A LINE FUNDING WITH THE NEW FISCAL REALITY THE MAYOR OF IT'S AN PROPOSES TO REDUCE FUNDING FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA BY TEN PERCENT. OR ROUGHLY SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ANY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS PRODUCTION AND POST ELIMINATION OF A TWO POINT 31% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. FINALLY THE MAYOR VISION ALSO INCLUDES PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT REDUCTIONS TO SEVERAL QUE FIVE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO FURTHER LIMIT HAVING TO MEET FACE REDUCTIONS TO THE OF THE ATTACK. ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH LEGISLATURE TO PASS A BALANCED BUDGET TO PROVIDE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH FLEXIBILITY IS TO HELP NAVIGATE THESE DIFFICULT TIME. I HAVE WITH ME- SEVERAL COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE ROOM THAT CAN ANSWER SOME OF THE MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ON THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU.

WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE COVERT NINETEEN CRISIS IS AND I'M PRESIDENTE MOMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND WORLD HITCHED HISTORY WHICH HAS LED TO A DISASTROUS IMPACT ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY. WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S WORK TO KEEP EDUCATION FUNDING AND CHANGE DURING THE CURRENT YEAR DESPITE THE DROP IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM COULD GUARANTEE. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PER EIGHTY A RATE ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE BUILT INTO THE EXISTING FUNDING STRUCTURE WE FURTHER APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR HAS SHOWN TO ADDRESS THE NEW REALITY CREATED BY THE NINETEEN. EIGHTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO K. TWELVE EDUCATION TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS AND OTHER SOCIAL IT. WELL THE FUNDS WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE NEW COSTS FOR SCHOOLS ARE SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE A NEED ALL IN LIGHT OF THE CUTS PROPOSED IN EDUCATION PARTICULARLY THOSE CUTS TO THE ALTHEA PFAFF. THAT RICK INTO THE LC. IT IS SIGNIFICANT. IN OF ITSELF HOWEVER IT MUST BE WEIGHED IN THE OF THE INCREASED COST TOOLS. WE CAN ALL THIS FROM TO MAKE. THIS RESORT. WILL IN EACH APPS LARGER CLASS. RE IN TRANSFER. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN. AFFORD ARE TO. ESPECIALLY EPIDEMIC. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE LEARNING GOING FORWARD WHETHER IT'S THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING OR HAVING STUDENTS RETURNED TO SAFE AND CLEAN SCHOOLS. OUR FOCUS IS TO ENSURE THAT WHEN SCHOOLS REOPEN STUDENTS TEACHERS AND ALL SCHOOL PERSONNEL ARE SAFE AND CONTINUE TO BE SAFE. THAT INCLUDES HAVING AVAILABLE PP CLEANING SUPPLIES THE ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY SCREEN STUDENTS AND STAFF AND DEVICES FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS THAT NEED TO CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING. WHEN SCHOOLS REOPENED WE MAY ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING WE ALSO HAVE TO PROVIDE TEACHERS WITH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AND ENSURE THEY ARE COMFORTABLE AND PREPARED FOR THE NEW AND VARIED APPROACHES TO TEACHING. THESE MEASURES ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLEX UNDERTAKING AND THE BEST MATE NEEDED TO ENSURE WE CAN SAFELY RE OPENED SCHOOLS WHICH WE ALSO KNOW IT'S CRUCIAL TOWARDS EACH AFTER. TO RE OPEN THE MONEY FOR WORKING FAMILIES. OUR TOP PRIORITY MUST BE BOTH IN STATE OF OUR STUDENTS STOP. BURNING FIRST. STOPS IN WE MUST REMEMBER THAT WE ARE NOT JUST. TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO WITH LESS FUNDING WE'RE ASKING SCHOOLS TO DO EVEN MORE WITH MUCH LESS. WHEN THIS PANDEMIC STARTED SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN FORM SEVERAL TASK FORCES IN MEMBERS FROM BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS THE CHANGES IN EDUCATION. THE TASK FORCE FOCUSED ON CLOSING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS WORKING TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH DEVICES AND WIFI ACCESS NEEDED TO CONTINUE LEARNING. CALIFORNIA NEEDS AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND LAPTOPS ARE DEVICES AND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND WIFI HOTSPOT TO CONNECT EVERY STUDENT TO THE INTERNET AT HOME. WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER AND BE CREATIVE THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY BUT WE ARE ASKING THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR LOOK FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO FIND EDUCATION AND NOT READ. THE FUNNY SO DESPERATE NEED OUR TEAM IS HERE IN THE ROOM. FIVE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA L. IN C. D. E. ON THE- ON THE BIG PICTURE- WALK THROUGH OF THE MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. WENT TO NOW FOCUS ON THE K. TWELVE PIECE AND SET ASIDE YOU SEE FIT FOR A ATER PART OF TODAY'S HEARING. AND ENGAGE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO- ASK QUESTIONS ARE PRESENT- COMMENTS OR SUGGESTIONS ARE I'M GONNA START WITH A FEW AND- I'LL START WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MEXICAN TO TAKE THIS OFF BECAUSE I DO HAVE. THAT PLENTY OF DISTANCE AND A LITTLE COCK IN THE MIKE IN FRONT OF US HERE- I WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE OVERALL. BIG PICTURE OF THE- THE ARCHITECTURE OF THIS OF THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. AND THE TRIGGER CUTS- WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY NOT HAPPENED IF WE GET THE FEDERAL SUPPORTS IN THAT SECOND ROUND OF THE- OF WE HAVE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF TRUST AND RESPECT FOR OUR GREAT. SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE- WHO OF COURSE HELL SOME CALIFORNIANS SAN FRANCISCO IN THE DISTRICT OF OUR BUDGET CHAIRMAN IS JOINED BY IS TODAY MR TANG- BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE DECISION OF THE CONGRESS THE HOUSE IT'S THE U. S. SENATE. AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY LOUD SO FAR SAYING NOT SO FAST. IN SO WHAT ARE ARE PLANS IF- SENATOR MCCONNELL AND CREW I DON'T GO AHEAD AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR NEEDS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS OUR PLAN B. DO WE HAVE A PLAN B. BECAUSE ONE OF THE CONCERNS I THINK THAT I HAVE AND THAT I THINK PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE IS THAT WE SURE WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO GO THROUGH THIS AND GET AS MUCH BUT ALL SURPRISE WE CAN. BUT THE TIMES IT AND SO ONLY THOSE ARE BUDGET BEGAN IN A FEW MONTHS BUT IF WE WANT TO PUT FOR EXAMPLE A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT A REVENUE MEASURE OR- DEFICIT REDUCTION BOND LIKE WE DID FIFTEEN YEARS AGO UNDER SWARTS IN ANGER THAT DISCUSSION HAS TO HAPPEN THE SAME TIME AND THAT NEEDS TO BE THE SEPTEMBER TRY WRAPPER BUDGET SO ESSENTIALLY- WHAT IS OUR PLAN B. FIND A- AMBER SANDERS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THAT THE PLAN IS WHAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE MAYOR VISION- THE WAY THAT THE TRIGGER WORKS IS IT'S STRUCTURED AS A REVERSE TRIGGER SO THE FACT THAT YOU SEE IN THE MIRROR VISION TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ABLE TO BE DRAWN DOWN THOSE THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS WAY TO WHAT WE TO THE CUT BUT YOU'RE SEEING PRESENTED IN A MAJOR REVISION NOT HAPPENING. THE CUTS AROUND SIXTY FIVE BILLION- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE MAIN MAIN CUT- THAT WE WOULD LIKELY FOCUS THOSE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ON TO THE EXTENT THEY ARE GOING DOWN I'M HARPER THERE IS A CONTROL SECTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS COORDINATING- GLOBALLY THAT WILL LAY OUT COME ABOUT FREE MARK IN THE MECHANICS OF HOW THAT WOULD WORK TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RECEIVED SEVERAL. OKAY I'M SO QUESTION A AND FOR MISS ALEX. AND I. I'M CERTAIN THAT YOU ARE. WHAT I SAYING I KNOW WHAT THE TRIGGER WOULD MEAN- IF WE DON'T GET THE DIGITAL FEDERAL MONEY. BUT WHAT'S THE PLAN B. IF IN TWO WEEKS. THERE'S A HARD NO FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE OR CONGRESS AND YOU KNOW WHAT. THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR OURS OUR STATES. AND OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THERE'S NO OPTION FOR THE FEDERAL pMEANS THE TRIGGER CUTS WOULD WOULD HAPPEN WE GET THAT WHAT THAT MEANS IN THE CONTROLLING WHICH THE BUDGET. BT WHAT IS OUR PLAN B. FROM THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION AS FAR AS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER OPTION. IS THERE ANOTHER OPTION AS FAR AS I KNOW. THERE'S SOME- SOME REVENUE PROPOSALS HE LAID OUT LAST THURSDAY IN THE MAY REVISE BUT- IS THERE A THOUGHT ABOUT- LOOKING AT A PLAN B. YOUR PLAN SEE- POTENTIALLY GOING THE VOTERS TO ASK THEM. TO HELP MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICE ESSENTIALLY JERRY BROWN DID% THIS IN TWENTY TWELVE HE SAID HEY. VOTERS YOU WANT TO. USE IN CSU FINDING DOUBLE CALLS- TUITION CUT SCHOOL FUNDING VOTE YES FOR PROP THIRTY IN VOTERS HAD TO MAKE A TOUGH CHOICE AND THEY MADE THAT CHOICE- WE COULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT. BUT THAT I RECALL. WELL WORK IN THE MOTION TO HAVE. READY TO GO BY. LATE JUNE EARLY JULY. IS THERE A PLAN B. A PLAN SEE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE GOVERNOR IF THE FEDERAL MONIES DO NOT MATERIALIZE. MICHAEL CONVERSATIONS HAVE NOT STOPPED NOW THAT THE MAJOR REVISION IS OUT AND THIS IS A VERY YOU KNOW FLEXIBLE AND FLUID PROCESS AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF MY I'M POLITICS YOU CAN TALK MORE ABOUT A SPECIFIC HERE REVENUE. QUESTION. GOOD AFTERNOON LEADERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- AT THE AMBER- HAD MENTIONED. THINGS HAVE BEEN MOVING VERY FAST AND FURIOUSLY AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND THERE'S A LOT OF PROPOSALS IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS GOING OUT THROUGH. OUT FINANCE AND I'M SURE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SO MODES A LOT OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE HELP OUR OUTSIDE IF YOU CAN UNITS PER YOU HAVE PERCENT. TAKE SIX. MORE INFORMATION ON ANY CONVERSATIONS WE WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU. OUT WITH SOME OTHER INFORMATION FROM OTHER UNITS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE ON. AND I REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST THE EDUCATION BUDGET WHICH YOU'RE- CERTAINLY- BEEN INVOLVED WITH US FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS ON BUT- A LARGER STRUCTURAL ISSUE IN ARCHITECTURE AT THE END. OF THEIR- CALIFORNIA FISCAL PLAN SO- BUT WITH THAT I THINK THAT. WE'LL HEAR LATER FROM THE CHILD CARE- IMPACT- HIGHER READ TOMORROW AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR OUR CALLS UNIVERSITIES. BUT THE NOTION THAT WE JUST KIND OF. ALL LAND YEAH WE'RE ALL IN TRYING TO GET ADDITIONAL FEDERAL MONEY- WERE ALL IN WITH OUR NATIONAL LOCATION OURS BUT WE'RE WE'RE SOLID HERE ON THAT STOP SIGN CALIFORNIA THERE'S THINGS ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL. THE U. S. SENATE BASED UPON WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM US SENATORS THIS VERY THING AS FAR AS HELPING OUT. ON STATE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA CELL I THINK THAT WE NEED TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT IS OUR PLAN CALIFORNIA WHAT WHAT DO YOU TO DEAL. AND PUT THOSE THINGS IN PLACE BECAUSE- A MEASURE OUT FOR EXAMPLE IT HAS TO CLEAR. PICTURE BY LATE JUNE EARLY JULY. ITSELF WERE WAITING AROUND FOR THREE OR FOUR MORE WEEKS. AND NOT PREPARED FOR THAT THAN THAT HAS. DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES ON KIDS IN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. SO ALL TAKE A TIME OUT FOR THAT- NOW I WANT TO GO TO. THE NOTION OF- OF THAT THAT THAT THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED SO FAR. IS PROMISING. HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THAT DISTANCE AWAY THAT WOULD THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO DO MORE WITH LESS ESPECIALLY WHEN SCHOOLS REOPEN. SO MAYBE THE PARMA FINANCER LA- CAN TALK ABOUT IT. IF WE- DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH- WELL EITHER WAY SO IF THE TRIGGER IS PAUL THEN WE HAVE THESE CUTS IS THERE REALLY. A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR- BACK FILL OUT THIS YEAR FOR PROGRAMS- I KNOW WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THAT POTENTIAL SIX BILLION WOULD CUTS FOR LC A FAST AND THE FOUR BILLION IN THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION BUT IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL DISTRICT. HERE IN SACRAMENTO ARE LA RIVER CENTER BY WHAT HAVE YOU. TO KEEP HOLE THEY'RE CURRENTLY DOING OR WILL THEY HAVE TO. FOCUS ON LAYOFFS INCREASE CLASS SIZE AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU I COULD START AND TAKE THE QUESTION I THINK THAT. THE ONE OF THE KEY THINGS. YOUR MISTER CHECK OF ONE OF THE KEY QUESTIONS THIS SORT OF WHAT SCHOOL LOOKS LIKE WHEN IT REOPENS AFTER A VERY IMPORTANT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. I'M LOOKING AT THE BIG PICTURE NUMBERS AS I MENTIONED I DESCRIBE IN OUR PRESENTATION THAT THE NUMBERS LOOK ROUGHLY FLAT- SO IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT THERE WOULD. BE IMMEDIATE- NEED TO SAY FOR EXAMPLE HAVE. MAJOR LAYOFFS AND THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FIFTY WITH ITS ARE APPEARS TO BE VERY FLEXIBLE AND WILL PROVIDE DISTRICTS OFFICE BILLION DECIDING HOW TO USE THOSE FUNDS THAT CAN BE. YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO- WE THINK THAT THE RESULT. SCHOOLS USE THOSE. AND THEY HAVE TO ME. NOT NOT HAVE MAKE BIG BIGGER. HOWEVER I THINK THAT QUESTION IS SORT OF WHAT THE SCHOOL LOOK LIKE AND WHAT ARE THE EXPECTATIONS. DO DO WE HAVE DO WE NEED TO HAVE MORE ADULTS AROUND TO MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE SAFE- IF THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE A GREATER USE OF FACILITY THAT WE WANT TO HAVE KIDS MORE SPREAD OUT THOSE KINDS OF COST PRESSURES ARE. ISSUES THAT. NEED TO BE CONSIDERED IN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD. WHETHER THIS FUNDING AMOUNT WHAT WITH THE IMPLICATION IS. OF THE FUNDING. THE IS WHAT. THE KEEP. THAT THE LET'S SEE WILL BE THREE FIFTY. THE PARTY IS HORRIBLE MUCH OF THE- THAT IS A VERY UNCERTAIN CONVERSATION- AND- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SURE. WHEN SCHOOL. SOME SCHOOLS WILL WANT TO. OPEN UP PHYSICALLY. AND SO I THINK. TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT COULD BE DIFFICULT BUT I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS HAVE CONTENT AND THINKING ABOUT- HOW HOW. THIS THIS LEVEL OF FUNDING WOULD AFFECT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M JUST TO ADD TELL WHAT THEY ALEJO'S STATED. WE DID TRY TO CRAFT THE LANGUAGE I'M TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE NOTING THAT ONLY A FOR GONNA AND YOU DON'T. QUITE A BIT OF FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE FACING- WITH REGARDS TO THAT THE- PERIOD OF TIME- HAVE AND WHICH ALWAYS CAN SPEND THAT'S FINE. I'M HOT SEEMS TO HAVE- DIFFERENT GUIDANCE COMING OUT FROM THE FEDS. AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THE GARDEN TO ITS STILL TRICKLING OUT AND TO THE EXTENT- YOU KNOW THAT WE RECEIVE- GUIDANCE AROUND SPECIFIC USES OR AM. ANYTHING AROUND YOU KNOW STATE LEVEL ACTIVITIES WE WILL HAVE TO REVIVED IN LINE WITH THAT KIND OF. BUT OUT OF THE MAJOR REVISION BOTH THE LANGUAGE DOES REFLECT KIND OF WHERE WE ARE AM IN RETURN IN REGARDS TO GOD IF I HAS COME OUT AND NOT. WITH THE WITH THE REST OF A FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN KERR'S FINDS. THAT O'LEARY'S CAN GO BACK TO THE PERIOD OF MARCH FIRST AND SPEND THOSE DOLLARS FROM THAT PERIOD ON TO DECEMBER THIRTIETH. AND ANY COSTS THAT THEY INCURRED DURING THAT TIME THAT ARE- COOKING. NINETEEN RELATED. OKAY THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT I THINK WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THE ED COALITION MEMBERS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A BIT FOR PUBLIC CALM AS FAR AS WHAT THIS WHAT THIS REALLY MEANS AND IT KIND OF A REALITY CHECK FOR THAT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT. THAT IS DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR- HELD HARMLESS REALITY. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE- THE TRIGGER CUTS AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MID OVERALL MAY REVISE PROP NINETY EIGHT SOLUTIONS HAS THE GOVERNOR. OUTLINED LAST THURSDAY TALKED ABOUT ROUGHLY A THIRD THIRD THIRD SO A THIRD CAN DEFERRALS THIRD AND TRIGGER CUTS IN THE THIRD ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDS. OF COURSE THOSE TRIGGER CUTS WOULD GO AWAY FORGOTTEN FEDERAL MY WOULD BE ROUGHLY IS. FUNDS AND ONE THIRD DEFERRALS AND SO DEFERRALS ARE SOMETHING THAT WE'VE USED BEFORE DURING THE PRIOR- BUDGET- TOUGH TIMES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE QUESTION IS AS PART OF THIS DIALOGUE- CAN WE CONSIDER LARGER DEFERRALS. TO MITIGATE AND REDUCE SOME OF THE POTENTIAL TRIGGER CUTS AND COULD THAT WORK WOULD THAT WORK SO IF BOTH LA OWN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD. ADDRESS THAT. AND GO AHEAD AND START ON THAT PIECE OF THE- DEFERRAL AMOUNT THAT YOU SEE REFLECTED IN THE MAJOR VISION. ARE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY FEELS- IT'S A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN CUTS AND DIFFERENT RECOGNIZING THAT AT SOME POINT THOSE DEFERRAL COST YOU HAVE TO BE. REPAID WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE GET MORE. INFORMATION AROUND STATE REVENUES WE MAY NEED TO GO BACK AND TAKE AND TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THIS. BUT AT THIS TIME THAT BALANCE THAT STRUCK ME REVISION IS- WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE. OKAY AND THEN I KNOW IT'S NOT PART OF EARLY EDUCATION PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE BUT- AS FAR AS THE CATEGORICAL CUTS. I JUST WANNA NOTE THAT ONE OF THEM WAS ACES AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM AT HIS DISPENSED WITH SENSUALLY. I'M CHILD CARE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES SO I'LL COME BACK TO THAT IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION. THE THANK YOU THAT'S IT FOR NOW THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER GALLAGHER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SO I'LL TRY TO GET THE RIFLE THROUGH A FEW THINGS HERE ONE. IN THIS TO BE FOR DO F. IT LOOKS TO ME FROM REVIEWING THIS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OVERALL ENERAL FUND REDUCTION OF EIGHT POINT SIX PERCENT. IN THE MAY REVISE. YET IN THE PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND FUNDING IT IS FOURTEEN POINT THREE PERCENT. LESS SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IT'S NOT PROPORTIONAL TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF GENERAL FUND MáS AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE COULD DO IN THIS IN THIS YEAR RIGHT NOW. AND IS GOING TO GET TO A COMMON THEME HERE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THE RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY TO TRY AND KEEP IT AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE- AND- SO WHY NOT RIGHT SIZE THAT LOOKS LIKE EIGHT POINT 6% REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND YET. WE'VE GOT A FOURTEEN POINT 3% REDUCTION. IN PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUNDS IN THE MAY REVISE. I HAVE- MY COLLEAGUE COME UP TO SPEAK ABOUT. HELLO AGAIN REASON IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- AS YOU KNOW EDUCATION IS FUNDED WITH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES SO THAT IS REALLY JUSTICE- IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULA. SO THE DECREASE IN REVENUES IS A 38% WILL BE HAD AT WITH THE GUARANTEE BECAUSE WE'RE IN A TEST WHEN YOU ARE- THAT'S JUST THAT TO THE EXTENT YOU WANT TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CONSTITUTIONAL FORMULA WOULD. REQUIRE OVER APPROPRIATE GUARANTEE AND THAT MEANS CUTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET SO IT. IT'S A BALANCING ACT WAS PRIORITIES I THINK WE DO THAT IN THIS YEAR TO HELP KEEP EDUCATE AND STAPLE. SO YEAH I WOULD BE OPPOSE IN THAT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO A CORRECT. THAT IT YES YOU COULD DO THAT YOU COULD APPROPRIATE. RIGHT AND THEN AND THEN INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT DOING THIS OVER A THREE YEAR AND MAKE A THREE YEAR FUNDING COMMITMENT WHEN WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT. THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE GOING TO BE. WE TRY RIGHT SIZE OF THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE PROPOSING TO DO A THREE YEAR FUNDING COMMITMENT- TO THE TUNE OF THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVEN'T SEEN WITH ACTUAL REVENUE SO ARE YOU KNOW THAT ARE GOING TO BECOME AND WE'RE JUST. WORKING PROJECT ENDS. AGAIN I SAY LET'S TRY TO FIND. MORE THIS YEAR. AND NOT JUST TAKE THE TEST ONE BUT MAYBE FROM FROM MORE THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE CAN DO THAT KEEP IT CONSISTENT WITH. AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND AND NOT MAKE A COMMITMENT. YOU KNOW TWO MORE YEARS DOWN THE ROAD. IT'S GOING TO PUT US IN A PLACE WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THOSE OBLIGATIONS AND CERTAINLY IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET HEARINGS. WE CAN MAKE THOSE DETERMINATIONS RIGHT. IT TO THE EXTENT YOU OVER HER PRE THE GUARANTEE I I'M SURE I DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS BUT IT MEANS THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SOMEONE ELSE WILL NEED TO TAKE. THAT CUT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE BALLOT THE BUDGET IS BALANCED WITH THE A PROP NINETY EIGHT AT THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND- WILL. OR SOME OTHER A WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT CUTTING THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT. DON'T KNOW THAT WOULD BE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IT COULD BE. ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS BUT- EDUCATION IS A BIG PRIORITY SO I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT ONE. BY MAKING SURE THAT IT SIZE- THIS YEAR LET ME RUN THROUGH JUST A COUPLE MORE THINGS. AGAIN I WOULDN'T CREATE THIS MULTI YOUR OBLIGATION I THINK YOUR POINT WHERE SAY IN OURSELVES UP FOR TROUBLE THERE WITH A THREE YEAR THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLAR OBLIGATION. LET'S DO IT RIGHT THIS YEAR. IN THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION THE FOUR POINT FOUR THAT WERE READ REALLOCATING USING FEDERAL FUNDS. COULD THIS BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES THERE'S A BIG FOCUS HERE ON- LEARNING LAWSON AND ESPECIALLY ON GETTING. YOU KNOW MORE DEVICES BUT AS MY COLLEAGUES ON BEACH POINTED OUT OUR LAST YEAR IN THIS BECAUSE YOU GIVE SOMEONE A DEVICE DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'VE CONNECTED THEM DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY LEARNING AT HOME- AND AGAIN I THINK I'M MORE FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN. IS A VERY GOOD CHANCE WE COULD REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS IN THE FALL- THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS- BUT GETTING KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL GETTING BACK INTO PROGRAMS. AND MEANWHILE WE'RE CUTTING WE ARE CUTTING. ATTACK AND WE'RE CUTTING AFTER SCHOOL. WHICH I THINK ARE TOO BIG PRIORITIES THAT MAYBE IF WE RE SHIFTED THESE MONIES AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. MAYBE GOING A LITTLE BIT MORE THIS YEAR ABOVE THE- TEST ONE. MAYBE USING SOME OF THIS FEDERAL MONEY. WE COULD MAKE THOSE THINGS PRIORITIES AND NOT JUST FOCUS IT ON PURCHASING MORE DEVICES AND- BECAUSE ALSO MY WORK WHAT THESE KIDS NEED IS ACTUAL. YOU KNOW INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOL THAT'S GOING TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING TO HELP REMEDY THE LEARNING LOS RIGHT. EVER OUTLANDER CAN WITH FINANCE- YOU ARE RIGHT AND THAT THE REASON WHY THE LANGUAGE IS WRITTEN AND THE WAY THAT IT IS IT IS PROBABLY NOT- THAT IF IT IF AND ONLY EIGHT CHOSE TO. TAKE THESE DOLLARS AND- THEY FELT THAT THE BEST WAY TO- OFFER ADDITIONAL ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR STUDENTS WAS TO DO IT FOR AFTER SCHOOL OR THROUGH CTT PROGRAMS. THEY COULD DO THAT UNDER THE PROPOSAL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD HAVE TO CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW SPEND THOSE DOLLARS IN LINE WITH A WITH FEDERAL LAW- BUT IT IS IT IS QUITE BROAD AT THIS POINT SO LONG AS THOSE EXPENDITURES ARE RELATED DIRECTLY TO MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF OCTOBER NINETEEN SCHOOL CLOSURES. OKAY SO WITHIN THAT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION THERE IS FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT IN OTHER WAYS. SO LONG AS FINISH ARE ARE TO THE HOOK OF A- AND RELATED LEARNING. TAPERED TYPE. YES I ALSO REALLY LIKE THIS IDEA THAT THE LA- PROPOSES OF MAYBE YOU CAN HELP TARGET THAT INCOME TARGET THAT MONEY TOWARDS LOW INCOME IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS RATHER THAN JUST DOING AS A BLANKET GRANT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS ARE OPEN TO. THE PROPOSAL- AS STRUCTURED BY THE ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY- PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE TARGETED- BUT IT'S TARGETED SPECIFICALLY OP BOTH L. USE THAT GENERATE CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING- FOR THE TWO POINT EIGHT. FIVE FIVE. MILLION OR BILLION DOLLAR PIECE- SO IT IS VERY VERY MUCH TARGETED ON THOSE- STUDENTS THAT GENERATE THAT FUNDING SO THAT YOUR FOSTER YOUTH YOUR ENGLISH LEARNERS- AND LOW INCOME. THE PIECE THAT'S NOT QUITE AS TARGETED IS. ONE AND A HALF BILLION THAT'S GOING OUT BASED ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND ROLL MY COUNTY. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS WE DID RECOGNIZE THAT ALL AND ALL. ALL UNITS ARE GOING TO. EXPERIENCE SOME LEVEL OF- LEARNING LOSS. AND WE FELT LIKE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW AND FUNDING TO GO OUT FOR. EDUCATION BASED BUT FOR PATIENTS. ONE OF POPULATION THAT WE FOR HAVE. PART OF UNDER SHIFTED AND FINE. BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE ALL THE AIDS WITH WHAT. TO SPEND. FUNDS BEYOND POPULATION. AND THAT'S A GOOD SO FOR ME BECAUSE ON. A SO I VERY MUCH OF. THE CAN COMMIT TO THIS ARE FIVE. FOR EQUALIZATION. I DO WANT TO DRESS THAT YOU ARE USING A THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ADA- FOR THE FUTURE. AND YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THE GOAL OF PROVIDING FUNNY STABILITY. YOU KNOW FOR THOSE ELEAZAR EXPERIENCING DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE AT WHICH IS MOST ELEAZAR. HOWEVER THIS APPROACH COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO ELEAZAR EXPERIENCING GROWTH SO WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE OPEN TO MODIFY AND THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE FUNDING BASED ON THE GREATER OF THE THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE OR CURRENT YEAR ADA. AND I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUE WHO HANDLES THAT SPECIAL EDUCATION TO COME UP ON THAT. AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE I'M SO IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION- WE WOULD BE OPEN TO CONVERSATIONS ON NOT. FORMULAS WELL WE CHOSE THREE ROLLING AVERAGE BECAUSE IT IT BETTER- ALLOW DISTRICTS TO KINDA RAMP UP AND DECLINED- MORE SMOOTHLY THAN THEY CURRENTLY DO SO. ANY MODIFICATION WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE A LOOK AT. OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE NEXT- MISTER MARTUCCI THAN MISTER MEDINA THAN MISTER MOAN AND THEN MISTER DON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF BY SUPPORTING WHAT THE MISTER GALLAGHER WAS SHOCKED TALKING ABOUT IN IN TERMS OF A COMMON MANTRA THAT WE HAVE HEARD OFTEN IN THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE SHOULD NOT. TREAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- A MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS A- AS A CEILING. I ALSO AGREE THAT EDUCATION IS AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE OUR NUMBER ONE A BUDGET PRIORITY AND SO IF THAT MEANS- FUNDING ABOVE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND PULLING FROM OTHER A PRIORITIES I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. NUMBER TWO. I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL IS- TAKING THAT THE LARGEST- POTS OF MONEY OF- ESPECIALLY THE FEDERAL AID THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED AN TREATING CLEAR WINNERS AND LOSERS BETWEEN THE CONCENTRATE CONCENTRATION. GRANT DISTRICTS AND THE NON CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS- WHERE IN LARGE PART SUPPOSED TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEAL WITH THE COST OF KEEPING THEIR KIDS AND THEIR STAFF SAFE THOSE COSTS ARE BORNE BY ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE A CONCENTRATION DISTRICT OR NOT. AND YOU KNOW IF THERE IS ANYONE OUT THERE WHO THINKS THAT THAT SUBURBAN DISTRICTS ARE NOT FACING YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT FACING THE SAME FINANCIAL. EVEN BEFORE THE PAN MAKE HIT YOU KNOW I CAN GIVE YOU ARE. TWO EXAMPLES FOR IT FROM MY DISTRICT SUBURBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT PASSED PARCEL TAXES YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO TRY TO- SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL SCHOOLS. I GIVE A GIVEN THE- THE REALITIES THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHERE THEY ARE READY RECEIVE. A DRAMATICALLY SMALLER. FRACTION OF DOLLARS THAN THOSE THAT HAVE THE HIGHER POPULATIONS OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND YET AT AN AND THIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL JUST DOUBLES DOWN TROUBLES DOWN ON THE INEQUITIES BETWEEN. THE DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE MORE DOLLARS FOR UNDER THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND THOSE THAT DON'T. CASE IN POINT YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- OF FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE CROWN OF VIRUS RELIEF FUND. AND A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO GO FOR LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION- WITH TWO POINT NINE BILLION TO GO TO ONLY TO THE DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE THE LC FF CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS I MEAN. THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT I CAN SUPPORT A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T GIVE. YOU KNOW. IS SOME ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THE CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ARE FACING TREMENDOUS COSTS FROM CORONA VIRUS SAFETY MEDICATION SO- I MEAN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK I DON'T THE LA- HAS THIS NUMBER. A YOU KNOW AT THE AT HAND BUT THE DO YOU HAVE THE. THE AVERAGE LCF FUNDING PER STUDENT FOR CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS VERSUS NON CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS. pTHAT ARE- THAT WE HAVE ARE EASILY AVAILABLE AT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL AMOUNT IS- A LITTLE OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT WE DON'T HAVE THAT- THAT SPECIFIC DIFFERENCE BUT IF I MIGHT ADD I THINK THERE'S A ANOTHER LIKE COMPARTE POINT THAT I THINK WE HAVE FOR WHY WE- CONCERNS BECAUSE AS WELL. EVEN WITHIN THE BUCKET A CONCENTRATION GRANT DISTRICTS- THEIR THEIR TREE AT ALL THE STATEMENT WE WE'VE GOT TO THINK THAT THAT'S CONCERNING SO- YOU KNOW THE STATEWIDE A PRIVILEGE OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME REGISTERS IS ABOUT 60% THE CONCENTRATION GRANT START THAT FIFTY FIVE IF YOU'RE DISTRICT TO HAVE 55% OF YOUR STUDENTS WHO ARE YELLOW INCOME FOSTER. AND YOUR DISTRESS 90% COURT YELLOW INCOME FOSTER UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL YOU'RE GETTING THE SAME AMOUNT PER STUDENT AND THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION SO AND NOW THOSE IN THOSE TWO EXAMPLES OF AND IN MANY WHO THAT. HE ARE. FIFTY THEY GET NOTHING SO. WE THINK THAT JUST IS NOT A VERY KNOW WHAT THE- THAT WE THINK DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDING. BASED ON TO. CHAIR OUR ENGLISH. IMPOSSIBLE THINK IT'S GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT'S ARE MORE BROADLY DISTRIBUTING FUNDING AN ADULT IS ALSO GOING TO BE GOING UP BASED ON THE DISTRICTS NEED. OKAY I'D I'D LIKE TO GET THAT OF THOSE DOLLAR FIGURES. OUT FROM YOU AND FOLLOW UP AFTER THIS MEETING BUT I JUST WANTED FOR A HIGHLIGHT. IN ADDITION TO THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LEARNING LOSS MITIGATION. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING. THERE IS THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FEDERAL FUNDING- WITH WITH ALMOST ONE POINT FIVE BILLION- OVER 90% GOING TO SCHOOLS BASED ON THE TITLE ONE FUNDING FORMULA NOW I UNDERSTAND. THAT THIS IS THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND SO WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER THIS BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA I. I HAVEN'T CONFIRMED THE THESE FIGURES BUT- YOU KNOW I REPRESENT BOTH LOS ANGELES UNIFIED. AND TORRANCE UNIFIED AND THERE'S ONE STREET THAT DIVIDES LOS ANGELES THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FROM. FROM THE THAT THE TORRANCE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JUST ONE ST YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE OF WESTERN AVENUE OR THE EAST SIDE OF WESTERN AVENUE. THAT DETERMINES WHICH DISTRICT URINE. LAUSD UNDER THE- THE ONE TIME SCHOOL FEDERAL FUNDING FORMULA UNDER THE TITLE ONE FORMULA THEY GET. AN ESTIMATED SIX HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS PER STUDENT WHILE TORRANCE UNIFIED GET SEVEN EIGHT DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IS JUST IGNORING THE REALITY THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU MAY LIVE ON THE WEST SIDE OF WESTERN AVENUE. YOU KNOW THAT SOMEHOW YOU YOU SUDDENLY ARE LIVE IN A MUCH APT. CA SO. THE THEY GOVERNOR THE OF FINANCE NEEDS TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THAT ALL DISTRICTS ARE HURTING THIS IS A SURVIVAL BUDGET AND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS AND ALL OF OUR STAFF AND ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OUR TEAM SAFE AND SO THIS. THIS AREN'T YOU KNOW THERE. IN AND AN INCREASE IN WINTERS IN YOUR IS BETWEEN TO RECEIVE OUR OUR TARGET. OF A FOR THE FUNDING AND THOSE THAT ARE NOT IS SO I CANNOT REPORT. I MAILED TO MOVE ON TO IT. ANOTHER ISSUE THAT- THAT THAT I AM TRYING TO FOCUS ON WHICH IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE THERE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- DOCTOR. GREGSON INDICATED THAT THE STATE NEEDS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND COMPUTER DEVICES AND THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE THOUSAND HOT SPOTS. I AM ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SUMMER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A DISTANCE LEARNING BOND- IN ORDER TO TRY TO SUPPLEMENT THE DOLLARS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE FROM THE GENERAL FUND- TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COSTS SOME OF THESE COSTS OF COMPUTER DEVICES AND HOT SPOTS. AS DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CONSIDERED- THE OPTION OF BOND FUNDS. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE- THE URGENT NEEDS CREATED BY THIS PANDEMIC AS IT RELATES TO AS THEY RELATE TO DISTANCE LEARNING. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S CURRENTLY- ADDRESSED IN THE MAY REVISION THERE ARE- CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING- ON ON MULTIPLE LEVELS- RICK WITH REGARDS TO STEP THAT MAY BE TAKEN. TO RESPOND TO- YOU KNOW DROPS IN REVENUES- AND TO ENSURE THAT AT NOT ONLY ONLY A FOOT THE STATE THE WHOLE IS ABLE TO RECOVER THEM FROM THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. BUT I'M NOT AWARE I AM AT LEAST AT THIS POINT OF ANY CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING ON WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION AND BOND SPECIFICALLY. IS THE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DR GRETCHEN AVAILABLE. YES WE WILL CAP OFF THANK YOU. SAID LIKE TO CUT MENTION A COUPLE OF THINGS AS I MENTIONED BEFORE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE NEW EXPENSIVE AND THE EXPENSES AND NEED MORE REVENUE- WE DON'T FAVOR ANY PARTICULAR REVENUE STREAM WE JUST KNOW ADDITIONAL REVENUE WOULD BE NEEDED AND SO WE WOULD BE WILLING TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO EXPLORE ANY AND ALL REVENUE STREAMS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO OUR DIGITAL TAX FORCED TO INCREASE THE ACCESS TO OUR FAMILIES THAT HAVE ANY FOR YEARS TO SEVENTY I. MENTION PREVIOUSLY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. LAST TOPIC I'D LIKE TO TOUCH UPON IS. I SAID THIS IN A IN OUR LAST BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING AGAIN AND I LIKE TO SEE IT AGAIN BUT- END THIS. SURVIVAL BUDGET THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE FACING I. WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED TO HAVE AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR. DID NOT REYES AND THE LA HIGHLIGHTED THIS FACT THAT TO. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CRITICAL TOOLS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS USED IT DURING THE OUR LAST GREAT DOWNTURN THE GREAT RECESSION- WAS IN GIVING SCHOOL DISTRICTS FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF THEIR SCHOOL YEAR- TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY FROM THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAY- ARE. MINIMUM SCHOOL YEAR I. WE NEED WE NEED STATE LEADERSHIP TO PROVIDE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT FLEXIBILITY THE OTHER FLEXIBILITY THAT- THAT I KNOW THAT- WAS A HIGHLY VALUED- WHEN I WAS ON A SCHOOL BOARD DURING THE GREAT RECESSION WAS THE ABILITY TO MOVE MONIES. ARE AROUND FROM DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS- INCLUDING- BEING ABLE TO SWEEP. THE BALANCES OF ANY FUNDS THAT ARE NOT USED IN CERTAIN ACCOUNTS TO ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO USE THEM WHERE THEIR THEIR NEEDS ARE THE GREATEST AND SO I JUST LIKE TO CALL FOR- THE NEED FOR FURTHER FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN ORDER TO MATCH THEY THEY KNOW BASS WHERE THEIR GREATEST NEEDS ARE AND THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE DOLLARS TO WEAR THEIR GREATEST NEEDS ARE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I HAVE A THREE TOPICS THAT I WANT TO BRING UP- WITH COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING. SECOND THE AGE CAPS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THIRD ADDRESSING FOOD IN SECURITIES. SO GOING THROUGH THE FIRST TOPIC SPECIAL EDUCATION. I WANT TO VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MAINTAIN THE STATE'S COMMITMENT TO INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCES AND IMPROVING SPECIAL EDUCATION FINANCING PROGRAMS AND STUDENT OUTCOMES. THIS IS MUCH NEEDED FUNDING TO HELP INSURE THE EQUALIZATION OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. FOCUS ON ADDRESSING EQUITY THROUGH THE CREATION OF A NEW FUNDING FORMULA AND THIS TIME I URGE US TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING AB SIX OH TWO FUNDING FORMULA GIVEN ALL THE COURT CURRENT CHALLENGES THAT ARE DISTRICTS ARE FACING. SINCE THE GOVERNOR FIRST INTRODUCES BUDGET PROPOSAL IN JANUARY THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE ONLY INCREASED. GENERAL EDUCATION SETS A FOUNDATION FOR DISTANCE LEARNING AS SPECIAL EDUCATORS ARE WORKING TIRES LOOSELY TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS DISABILITY HAVE ACCESS AND APPROPRIATE ACCOMMODATIONS RELATED SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE EDUCATIONAL BENEFIT. DURING THIS CHALLENGING TIME. CONTINUATION OF CURRENT SERVICES VIA DISTANCE LEARNING IS ALREADY INCREASING SPECIAL EDUCATION CLASS AS ELEAZAR PIVOT TO VIRTUAL PLATFORMS AND PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SUPPORTS TO INDIVIDUAL STUDENT HOMES. THIS FUNDING IS CRITICAL TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS TO US WORK TOWARDS ESTABLISHING EQUITY. AND TOPIC OPPOSING CAPS ON CHARTER SCHOOL. I WANT EXPRESSED GREAT CONCERN WITH MY ROOMMATE DINA DO YOU WANT TO BREAK THEM UP AND HAVE THEM RESPOND TO EACH YEAR ISSUES OF QUESTIONS ON THE FIRST ONE SURE I DON'T I REALLY DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS BUT- IF THEY WANT TO RESPOND THAT THE- IT. ANYONE WANT TO RESPOND TO. SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND. IF THERE'S NO RESPONSE I'LL GO TO THE SECOND. OPPOSING CAPS ON CHARTER SCHOOLS I I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EFFORT. TO PLAYS AN H. CAP ON CHARTER SCHOOLS. THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE THAT I REPRESENT IS HOME TO FEEL CHARTER HIGH SCHOOL WHICH SERVES ADULT IMMIGRANTS AND FARM WORKERS. PROGRAMMING AT THIS SCHOOL HOUSE TO STRENGTHENED ROLE IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BY ADDRESSING EDUCATIONAL GAPS IN OUR CURRENT SCHOOL SYSTEMS. RIVERSIDE PROGRAM HAS OVER SIXTY PEOPLE ENROLLED AND IS VERY MUCH TIED INTO PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE AND HOPES TO EXPAND TO THE CITIES OF MORENO VALLEY PARIS AND SAMBAR MEDINA. IT SEEMS OF THE PROPOSED AGE GAP ON CHARTER SCHOOLS WOULD NOT ONLY DECIMATE PROGRAMS LIKE FIELD BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT LEAVES FEAR RESOURCES FOR ADULT IMMIGRANTS TO UTILIZED. AS THEY NAVIGATE THEIR LIVES AND COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE. NOW MORE THAN EVER AS WE SPEAK ABOUT HOW ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND IMMIGRANTS ARE TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND WORKFORCE WE SHOULD NOT MAKE POLICY THE CHANGES AND LEAVES AND BE HIGH. TWO QUESTIONS. ADD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S REASONING FOR INSTITUTING AN H. CAP. FOR PUPILS ENROLLED IN A CHARTER SCHOOL. EVER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES PLACE A CAP ON- ON CHARTER SCHOOLS- TO AT AT THE AGE OF UNDER TWENTY SEVEN SO THAT WILL PEOPLE'S UP THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND ALLOW THEM TO STILL BE FUNDED. THE REASON THAT THE CAPITAL AND SET AT THIS LEVEL IF WE WERE TRYING TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE- PARTNERING WITH- UNDER WE ALL PARTNERSHIPS AND PARTNERING WITH PROGRAMS LIKE CONSERVATION CORPS AND YOU FELT AND A LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS A CAP AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FOUR OR TWENTY FIVE. SO WE DID TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE- BUT REALLY THE CRUX OF THE REASON WHY WE ARE PROPOSING PROPOSAL IS BECAUSE AT SOME POINT BUT BUILT EDUCATION FUNDING MECHANISM IS A BETTER VENUE FOR- FOR PROVIDING- EDUCATION FOR ADULTS. AND AT THIS POINT WE'VE TAKEN IT UPON OURSELVES TO SETBACK CAP UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN FOR THAT REASON. THANK YOU. AND SECOND QUESTION TO THE MEN OF FINANCE. HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OF DONE ANYTHING TO REVIEW THE IMPACT. OF THIS NEW CAP ON SCHOOL SUCH AS FIELDS SAYS ARE TRAVIS. CHARTER SCHOOL AND IN DISTRICTS LIKE MY- WE HAVEN'T RESEARCH SPECIFIC AS SCHOOLS ARE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AT SCHOOL TO BUY AGAIN WE DID LOOK AT- SOME OF THE LARGER AT CONSERVATION. CONSERVATION CORPS PROGRAM AND YOUTH BUILD JOB CORPS AND TRIED TO ACCOMMODATE- IT EXCITING THE AGE CAP AT A LEVEL THAT WOULD NOT IMPACT THOSE PROGRAMS. SO I WOULD. SUBMIT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT. HAVING SEEN WHAT VALUABLE OF SERVICES THE PROGRAM IS- BY FEEL IN MY OWN DISTRICT I WOULD BE OPPOSED TO- GETTING- SETTING A CAP ON H. FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND TO THE LAST TOPIC ADDRESSING FOOD IN SECURITIES. WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN HAS HAD ON STUDENTS NOT ONLY ATTENDED SCHOOL BUT HAVING ACCESS TO SCHOOL MEALS. FOR SOME CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THOSE ON FREE OR REDUCED MEALS THESE MEALS RECEIVE IT SCHOOLS ARE THE ONLY ONES THEY WILL HAVE ON ANY GIVEN DAY. WE MUST ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING HUNGRY AND THE DISTRICTS AN ALLEY ETS ARE DOING THEIR PART TO ENSURE THAT THESE MEALS ARE STILL BEING PROVIDED. TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS SO QUESTION HOW OUR SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM WHICH ALREADY ARE UNDERFUNDED AND UNDERSTAFFED. DEALING WITH THE SIGNIFICANT FISCAL CHALLENGE FROM THE PANDEMIC. HOW MANY UHHUH BUT WENT WENT ONE MORE HOW MANY DISTRICTS ARE STILL IN DEFICIT DUE TO HIGHER OPERATIONAL COSTS MOSTLY TIED THE LABOR AND LOTS OF PAID REVENUE STREAMS EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE MAXIMIZING THEIR FEDERAL REAM REIMBURSEMENT. I MEAN I HAVE ARE- MY COLLEAGUE WHO HANDLES THE NUTRITION ASSIGNMENT COME UP TO SPEAK WITHOUT. IT HANSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE MAY REVISION PROVIDE SEVEN HUNDRED NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLER DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS UNFORTUNATELY THIS FUNDING IS NOT TERRIBLY FLEXIBLE I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SEE IF THIS FUNNY CAN BE A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBLE TO WORK AND HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT SCHOOLS ARE HONORING THAT MOMENT. I KNOW THOSE DIALOGUES ARE CONTINUING AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THE FUNDING THAT'S IN THE MAY REVISION WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE AVAILABLE TO HELP SCHOOLS THAT ARE- CHALLENGED BY THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. AND TO FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS OUR COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE IT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO SEE HOW MEAL PROGRAMS CAN BE USED. TO HELP FARMERS ESPECIALLY WHEN SO MUCH FOOD IS GOING TO WASTE. THERE IT IS I KNOW THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE WAS A PROPOSAL TO FOR A- ADDRESS MORE. AT TO HAVE SCHOOLS ENGAGE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND FARMERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- AND ALL THAT WAS PROPOSED. NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THAT STANDS MOMENT QUITE HONESTLY- WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION JUST GENERALLY ABOUT OUR SCHOOL FOOD PROGRAMS AND TO TRY TO MAINTAIN- ADEQUATE FUNNY TO KEEP THEM MANAGEABLE. AND MY LAST QUESTION DO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO PROVIDE HEALTHY MEALS HAVE SUFFICIENT GUIDANCE. AND TRAINING. AND THE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE THAT THESE MEALS ARE PROVIDED SAFELY AND HOW ARE THEY PAYING FOR THESE SUPPLIES. HI IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ANSWER SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AT EVERY DISTRICT I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DEPARTMENT ON WHAT SPECIFIC. IS THAT THEY'RE BEING THE LOCAL LEVEL- I HAVE NOT HEARD. IN GENERAL AFRICAN CHALLENGES THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HAVING A IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF HAVING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND DEALING WITH SOME OF THE MEAL PROGRAMS. THEN AGAIN I WOULD SAY THAT THE- RIGHTS AT NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WILL HOPEFULLY HELP SCHOOLS ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES IN WORLD THE- WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT FUNNY WILL ULTIMATELY BE AVAIL. TO HELP SCHOOLS. AND COULD I YOUR PRIVATE OF EDUCATION ON THE LAST QUESTION. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO REPEAT THE QUESTION. NO I AM WELL THINGS AROUND YOUR QUESTIONS AT MEMBER MEDINA IS OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND SITES THAT ARE OFFERING MEALS. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS CAUSING A DEFICIT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS NOT BEING ABLE TO BE REIMBURSED FOR THE COST OF THOSE MEALS SERVED. AND SO THEY ARE UTILIZING ENORMOUS OF STAFF I'M SURE THIS DISBURSEMENT OF FOOD BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO BE. REIMBURSED FOR THIS COSTS THROUGH THE FEDERAL WE- AS- PURSUED MANY DIFFERENT FEDERAL WAIVERS TO MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE FOR OUR DISTRICTS TO SERVE MEALS DURING THIS TIME SO THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR OUR FAMILIES- BUT AGAIN THAT DOES COME. AT A COST FOR DISTRICTS. THE TRAINING FOR P. P. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR NUTRITION SERVICES DIVISION ALONG WITH OUR DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THE BEST APPROACH IS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY TRAIN. OUR STAFF. AND FOR SCHOOL STAFF IT AND PART OF ONE OF THE RE OPENING TASK FORCE AT GOALS IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR NOT ONLY STUDENTS BUT STAFF AS WELL. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MOAN AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU AND TO AT THIS POINT SOME OF WHAT I'M GONNA SAY JUST REPEATS ARE ECHOES WHAT AT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- BUT FIRST I JUST WNT TO START OFF BY MAKING IT JUST A COMMENT OVERALL ABOUT THE STATE OF THE BUDGET. AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT AT I SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUES AND BELIEVABLE CONCERNING- IT THE THING THAT STICKS OUT IN THAT I'M HAVING A VERY HARD TO SWALLOW. EIGHT ARE CHAIRED QUESTION ABOUT KNOW WHAT'S PLAN B. YOUR PLAN SEE- IS THE UP THE EFFORT IN AND THE PER. THE FOR. I THE ENOUGH. ST ARE DOING AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WITH THE REASON. OF ENTER BEAN ASK TO DO SOMETHING. THAN WHAT WE'VE ASKED OTHERS TO DO COMMENT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE COMMENTED ON THE CHALLENGES WITH TECHNOLOGY IT'S NOT JUST LETTING THEM. THE EQUIPMENT IS GETTING THEM TO BE ABLE TO YOU. EQUIPMENT BUT AT ITS WHEN THE STUDENTS ARE ADDED THEIR SITE THEIR CONTROL- AND NOT IN THEIR PURVIEW- AND GETTING SOME RESULTS IN TERMS OF LEARNING SO I THINK THAT THERE'S REAL CHALLENGES- AND I DO HOPE. WE THINK ABOUT WHAT OUR PLAN. YOU KNOW B. OR C. I'M IF THE FEDERAL SPENDING DOESN'T COME THROUGH I KNOW THAT WHAT'S PROPOSES JUST FLAT OUT CUTS BUT WERE ASKING FOR ANOTHER PLAN- IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL FUNDING AND JUST. GOT OUT CUTS- STATING THAT THE US THAT YOU PUNISH SAY OVERALL. RELATION TO BUDGET- AND- WE SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE. I HAVE A CUP. IS IT AFTER SCHOOL. SPECIAL MEALS ALL THOSE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHAR EIGHT AT JUST PREPARING YOU A TO SEE WHO'S GONNA. COME UP AND ANSWER QUESTIONS I ON THE SPECIAL AND FRIENDS. YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD AT LEAST I'VE HEARD FROM SOME FOLKS IN MY DISTRICT- WHO APPRECIATE THAT ADMINISTRATION INCREASE IN SPECIAL EDUCATION RATES- BUT I AM CURIOUS ON WHY THE FORMULA THAT IMPACT- I'VE HEARD FROM MY DISTRICT AT THE- THEY- ARE THE AB SIX OH TWO FOR. THE FORMULA. WHAT MIGHT ITS FORMULA. I WE HAD A LOT OF IS THE- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT THE NEW FORMALLY AS VERY VERY SOMEONE'S BABY SIX OH TWO. WHAT IT DOES THOUGH IT STARTS THE LANGUAGE NEW THERE'S A LOT OF- CONFUSING SEGMENTS IN THE SIX OH TWO FORMULA THERE'S A LOT OF OUT ON CATEGORICAL THAT ARE FROZEN IN TIME THAT MAKE KNOWS AND- SO THIS WOULD JUST BE STARTING WITH THE BAY. WE HAVE WORKED THE STUDIES WAS. DIFFERENT THESE THEN. NOW AS WE MOVE OUT WHICH WOULD ADD THE EQUITY P. WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE PROGRAM SO YOU SAID IT'S SIMILAR BUT NOT IDENTICAL SO WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE DIFFERENT. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THREE A ROLLING AVERAGE FOR THE EIGHTY A RIGHT NOW- SPECIAL EDUCATION FORMULA IS KIND OF THE GREATER OF. PRIOR IN PRIOR YEAR- SO THEY THEY KIND OF GOT A THREE YEAR. OLD ARE TEAR HOLD HARMLESS BUT I'M NOT. YOU KNOW SOME OF THE FACT THAT WITH. FEARFUL TARA AND THEN THAT THAT IS MOSTLY THE BASE FORMULA- ISSUES I'M TRYING TO THINK I'M SORRY I DID NOT BRING. BACK UP ON THAT BUT- THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING HERE THAT COULD SPEAK TO A LITTLE BETTER THAN I BUT- THAT THAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS THE ATA. OKAY I'M ARE A IN THE IN I THINK AT THIS POINT THE- AGAIN YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THIS FROM MY COLLEAGUES BUT FLEXIBILITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO I'M TRYING TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT IN THESE REALLY TOUGH TIMES. SOMETHING SIMILAR BUT IS NOT IDENTICAL LIKE IS THAT WHERE. I'M TRYING TO MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS IS REALLY REALLY HARD SO IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THIS WHERE I'M LIKE IT MIGHT BE THE BEST. YOU KNOW FOR WHAT WHERE AND THERE BUT IF THE- DAYS. BUT NOT IDENTICAL FORMULA IS EASIER FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'D LIKE FOR US TO CONSIDER. PUTTING MORE AND DIFFERENT ON THEM IN A TIME WHERE. WE NEED MORE FLEXIBILITY I THINK IT. SOMETHING NEED TO LOOK AT INCOMES. I'M THE OTHER IS THAT. THAT I HAD RELATED TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND AGAIN SOME OF THIS IS BEEN SAID. THAT YOU KNOW AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE A FORM OF CHILD CARE FOR SOME OF OUR- MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND UP. IF OUR STUDENTS AREN'T GOING TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHERE ARE THEY GOING. AS FAR AS THAT A QUESTION FOR ME THAT IS A QUOTE I MEAN THAT'S A QUESTION FOR WHO EVER LET ANSWER IT SORRY AND I. TURNED AROUND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE NO THAT'S OKAY I CAN EITHER I'M RIGHT IN FRONT. WITH IT'S- VERY ODD DURING YOUR FACE YOU TO. AS WELL SO I. THE EIGHTH IS TO WHAT THE SLOTS FOR ACES WERE NOT CUT. IT WAS THE OUT ON A RATE. THAT WERE WOULD BE ADDITIONAL ADD ON HUNDRED MILLION THAT WENT TO THE RATE. SO THE RATE WOULD JUST REVERT BACK TO THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN RATE- SO THIS DID NOT ACTUALLY CUT ACCESS. AND IF I MIGHT ADD THIS IS THE PROPOSITION. DROPPED DRAMATICALLY AS OUR DISCUSSION EARLIER- WE DID WE DISCUSSED DEATH. SO ALL CATEGORICAL THAT SIDE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND NUTRITION WERE CUT. 50% IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN THE GUARANTEE ASUS HOWEVER WAS NOT CUT 50% JUST. MILLION BECAUSE THE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IS. PART OF THE PROPOSITION. FORTY NINE COMMITMENT. OKAY I'LL PROBABLY BEING BRING THIS UP AGAIN IN THE NEXT SECTION BUT I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES SOME OF THIS IS GOING TO BE FUNDAMENTAL NEEDED IN TERMS OF OUR ECONOMY. ARE RE OPENING AND SO AFTER SCHOOL AND CHILD CARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO I'LL LEAVE IT HEALTHCARE PART BUT- I'LL GO. FOR TWO. I'M IN A LITTLE BIT. AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE- IS ABOUT MEAL PROGRAMS AGAIN OUR SCHOOLS ARE DOING SO MUCH BUT THE MEAL PROGRAMS- HEALTHY EATING A IN HEALTH IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. AND I KNOW THAT. MY COLLEAGUE HAS BROUGHT. UP SOME ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT. A CD IF A IN CD ARE WORKING TOGETHER. YOU MENTIONED THERE IS A PROPOSAL ARE WE GOING TO SEE IN THEIR VERSION OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M A AND US IN. BLY GIRL FOR. THAT THE C. A LITTLE STABLE THIS WEEK. UNSTABLE THIS WEEK- IN TERMS OF WHAT ELSE WE MAY BE RECEIVING IT BUT WHAT IS THAT PLAN THERE I MEAN THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE. USED TO BE. REALLY IMPORTANT. FEEL IN A SEA LIKE. CALIFORNIA HAVE. YOU AT. DOING MUCH ARMS IF THEY'RE STATE THIS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO WORK. AND GOT. IN SOME TO FIGURE WHAT WE COULD DO AND WE'RE GOING TO NEEDS. ARE FOOD BAY ARE DOING IS MUCH AS CAN IN THEY ALL SING IN AND IT FEELS LIKE SCHOOLS COULD BE A PARTNER TO THIS GREATER ISSUE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS. DECIDEDLY. THAT WAS THE ENVY AND YET IT WAS A THERE IS A QUESTION SOMEWHERE IN THERE AND I'M HOPING SOMEONE CAN RESPOND WHAT ELSE ARE WE DOING- RELATED TO THE MAIL PROGRAMS- WHAT DO YOU DO WE DO WE THINK WE'RE GONNA. SOMETHING ELSE A DIFFERENT AND OF THE PROJECT THAT WE- NO LONGER. THERE IS IT JUST COMPLETELY ELIMINATED DOES IT MAKE SENSE FOR OUR STATE TO LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE THIS GIVING OUR STRONG ROOTS IN AG. BUT IT'S FAR AS WHAT WAS IN AND WHAT WAS OUT I'M NOT QUITE SURE. ENHANCE AND PART OF FINANCE US FAR AS WHAT IS IN AND WHAT IS OUT I'M NOT. QUITE SURE I'M FOLLOWING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IF YOU COULD CLARIFY THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND I THINK TO JUST ME INTERJECT. THIS IS AN ISSUE I KNOW SOMEONE OVER GALLAGHER BROUGHT UP FROM AN AG DISTRICT THAT. THE FARM TO SCHOOL PROGRAM. IS IN AND IT'S ANOTHER. I X. WHAT YOU. ARE FOOD NICK FOOD ACT. SO YES UP AGAIN AT THE FOOD NAG ISSUE AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COMMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OKAY THAT'S WHERE I JUST HOPE THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS I MEAN BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN- AND THERE COULD BE A PARTNERSHIP THERE- THIS IS A BIGGER ISSUE PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE HUNGRY PEOPLE ARE LOSING THEIR BOB AND SO I WANT TO THINK ABOUT HOW. COMPLY ROLE IN THIS DON'T WANT KIDS GO HUNGRY SO I WANT TO ECHO OF WHAT'S BEEN SAID BY I APPRECIATE THAT THIS ISN'T THE COMMITTEE IT'S A DIFFERENT COMMITTEE AND THEN FINALLY I HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO. JUSTIN AGE. AND I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- WHY WAS THIS AGE CAP PUT IN PLACE AND WHAT PROBLEMS IT TRYING TO SOLVE. I NEVER OUT. OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE A GOOD FIT FOR THIS THAT THE EVER. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOTHE- THE PROPOSAL ORIGINATED BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT SOME OF THE MORE EGREGIOUS AT CAPE IF THAT WE PART OF. WHERE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ENROLLING STUDENTS YOU KNOW. WELL INTO THEIR FIFTIES OR SIXTIES IN SOME CASES AND CLASSIFYING THEM AS A SECOND GRADER TO AVOID I'M HAVING TO DO THAT THE STATE ASSESSMENT. AND THEN GENERATING I'LL SEE IF THAT BOTHERS FOR THOSE STUDENTS. SO WE- WE ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE A BALANCE- BYE BYE CRAFTING THE LANGUAGE TO ALLOW FOR LTFS APPORTIONMENT TO BE GENERATED. FOR THESE- STUDENTS THROUGH THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX- AND THEN THE YOU KNOW IT ANY STUDENT OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY SEVEN WOULD NOT GENERATE ELSE GET HALF DOLLARS. GOT IT SO I GUESS IT YOU KNOW MY FEEDBACK IS THAT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY WAYS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING. TO US ALL FOR- IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPACTS THE SPECIALTY PROGRAMS I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR A COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE MENTIONED A PROGRAM THAT'S SPECIFIC TO FARMWORKERS- MY DISTRICT WAS LOOKING TO SEEN. PROGRAM COME INTO THE DISTRICT AND IT'S JUST SO UNIQUE- AND IT'S SUCH A AND NICHE PROGRAM- AND- I WISH THAT WE HAD- FOLKS. WHO WERE OF SIR IN AGES WHERE A SECOND GRADE READING LEVEL WAS JUST TO GIVE AND BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT SO MANY. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WERE TRYING TO HELP AVE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS SO- IF THERE IS A WAY TO THINK ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIALTY PROGRAMS WHILE STILL SOBBING FOR THE PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE I HOPE THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THAT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SOMEWHERE MEMBER. AND AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ACTUALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. YES GO AHEAD. DID YOU WANT TO. TESTIFY YES THEY MEMBER LIMóN YOU HAD MENTIONED YOU HAD ASKED THE CVT WAS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CDFA AND I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT WE ARE WE HAVE WHAT'S CALLED THE STRING STRONG PARTNERSHIP. WITH CDFA AND WE ARE ALSO SHARING LIST OF LOCAL FARMS WITH SCHOOLS WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE IF YOU SAW ON THE JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL A VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP AROUND OUR LOCAL FARMS AND SCHOOLS IN MAKING THAT CONNECTION AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO ADVOCATE WITHIN THAT WORK. OKAY YOU SOME REMEMBER O'DONNELL I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU THROUGH TO THE PRESENTERS TODAY THIS IS NOT AN EASY TASK. CERTAINLY ON THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO ON THE STAFF SIDE TWO WE APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'VE DONE THUS FAR. BECAUSE JUST ABOUT ANY CUT WE FIGHT UP HERE IS GOING TO RESULT IN SOMETHING ELSE GETTING CUT I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT- WITH THAT ALL JUST. TO THE COMMON AND THAT'S ABOUT LIABILITY- WE NEED TO CONTEMPLATE SLIPPING SOMETHING INTO THE SOME LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET THAT SPEAKS TO LIABILITY BECAUSE NO INSTITUTION PUBLIC OR OTHERWISE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO OPEN IF WE IF THEY ARE HELD LIABLE. FOR EVERY MEDICAL ATTENTION LONG LINE NOW SO THAT'S JUST SOMETHING TO CONTEMPLATE I KNOW SCHOOL DISH. FEARFUL OF THE HE HELD UP. DOING IT SIX FOR ANY GOING WHERE SO THAT IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO CAUGHT. YES TO A QUESTION IT. FOUR POINT THREE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DO DO DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT FIGURE. THAT'S FOR THE ALEJO. I THINK- SO I THINK OUR- RECOMMENDATION OR OUR OFFICE PUT PRETTY TO FISCAL OUTLOOK- A WEEK BEFORE ME REVISION BUT WE HAD A PROBLEM DEFINITION THAT WAS. A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT THEN- BOTH THE MAGNITUDE OF DIFFERENCE OUR WITH NOT OF IT WASN'T A BIG AT THE THEME FROM LOOKING AT THE TOP A NUMBER I'M WE DO UP TO DIFFERENT ARE. REVENUE BASE SCENARIOS WILL CALL THE SHIPS AND EN EL IN OUR BUT YOU SHOULD CENTER BEING A BIT MORE UP. IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY BECOME RECOVERS. TLC MORE PESSIMISTS. I'M ARE COMPARING. OUR FORECAST THE MAYOR VISION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ARE. VISION IS VERY SIMILAR TO OUR OUT STATE ARE MORE. SET EVEN IF I COULD THERE BE IS ABOUT BILLION DOLLARS LOWER THAN A SO IN TERMS OF WHAT GOING ON WITH THAT THIS IS CLOSE TO ARE MORE PRESSING SIX NERIO SOME OF THE BIG DIPPER IS THE NUMBER WERE JUST TERMS OF YOU FOR EXAMPLE THE NOTE YOU THINK OF GEN YOUR PROPOSALS ARE STILL THERE NOT. PEOPLE ARE THE- GENETIC. THE PART THERE AND THEN CUTTING THE ARE IF CONSIDER A SOLUTION AND THAT. ARE IN THEIR ME REPEAT. OF I ONE OF THE BIG BUT REVENUE THINK WE'RE- WE'RE PRETTY. IF YOU'RE AT OUR MARKETS. SNOW SO ON COST BECAUSE WISE. GOING FORWARD YOU IN THE SAME PLACE. I THINK WE'RE STILL LOOKING AT THE WE'RE STILL AT THE ARMED. I KNOW IN OUR AND ON THE AND IT'S- BUT- YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT AS BIG OF A- DIFFERENCE I. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A OF DIFFERENT I KNOW THAT ON. I'M SOME OF THE OF PROGRAMS THAT THAT EDUCATION AT THE SUPER GOT HELPING YOU SERVICES. OUR ARMED. WE ARE LOOK UP OF QUE BUT A FEW BUT I DON'T THINK AT POINT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH. TO TELL YOU THAT WE THINK THAT WE HAVE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THOSE PURPLE GONNA LIKE STILL DOING SOME RE. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU ADJUSTS ONCE EVERY. COME FROM. FIRST SHE- OR HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FOR. POINT HAVE THAT BILLION WILL TO A ONLY THOSE. THAT RECEIVE CONSTANT MONEY. THAT'LL BE A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- I'M LOOKING AT TWO STUDIES HERE THERE'S A SELF A STUDY THERE'S TWO. GROUPS ONE IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. WHAT A SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND I KNOW WE'RE SWITCHING THE FUNDING SOURCES OUTSIDE OF NINETY EIGHT NOW IT APPEARS. BUT I THOSE ARE PRETTY EXPENSIVE STUDIES FOR THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO CONDUCT. AND YOU'RE NOT CONDUCTING THOSE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT WHEN THE STUDIES COME BACK AND BE. YOU KNOW. YOUR STUDY TO- WE MAY OR MAY NOT. AGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF THE STUDIES ARE THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE STUDIES BUT THEY DO SEEM LIKE EXTREMELY. EXPENSIVE VENTURES. AT THIS POINT IN OUR- IN OUR IN OUR- IN OUR HISTORY- SIDE SO I AM CONFUSED ABOUT AND ALSO WHO DOES OF STUDIES. IT IS IT IS THAT NEEDS TO BE A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION AS WELL. LET'S SEE SOME OTHER ITEMS IN HERE ARE WITH REGARD TO THE CUT K. TWELVE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAMS- THERE'S MORE TO THIS IS C. T. MONEY- TYPICALLY LAST COUPLE YOU'RE A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION ON NE SIDE HER FIFTY MILLION ON THE THEIR SIDE HUNDRED FIFTEEN IS A CD. OVER THE GONNA THE COMMUTE. WHICH IS TO MISTER AN VERY OPEN AT THE CAN COLLEGE HAVE NOVA. ADMINISTERING K. TWELVE MONEY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT WHY WOULD YOU SPLIT BOTH OF THOSE BUCKETS OF MONEY WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST SHIFT THEM BACK CD STORE HAS A STORE. VAN THE ENERGY THAT IS DOLED OUT THESE DOLLARS AND YET HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WELL WE'RE STILL GONNA HAVE TO ENTITIES DOLE THEM OUT. AMBER BUT WE'RE GONNA CUT EACH PART DOWN WHAT COULD SOMEONE SHARE WITH ME THE REASONING BEHIND THAT. EVER WONDER WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THE- THE ADMINISTRATION- CHOSE TO REDUCE BOTH PROGRAMS AS WELL AS EVERY OTHER CTV CATEGORICAL THAT EXISTS OUTSIDE OF BELL FEEDBACK BY FIFTY PERCENT. AND THAT IS WHY- YOU SEE YOU KNOW BOTH PROGRAMS BEING RETAINED BUT AT THE LOWER LEVEL. THANK YOU JUST TO ME IT SEEMS A NO BRAINER. LOOK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AND PUT REGARD AND THE- THE COMMUNITY CALL. ADMINISTRATION OF THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THE CD OF THE CAGE SIDE. PACIFIC LEE- DO YOU JUST LIKE A TIME FOR EFFICIENCY ALONE A- OF SCALE TO SWITCH IT BACK OVER TO CD WITH JUST STARKLY. HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT AND THE RESULTS OF AN RATHER NON CONTROVERSIAL SO I HOPE THAT WILL BE SOMETHING YOU'LL CONTEMPLATE- WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE HERE. QUICKLY CAN YOU TALK TO A CD PROGRAMS THE CHARTER AGE CAP I ACTUALLY AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK FIRST GRADERS- FORTY YEAR OLD SHOULD BE ENROLLED AS FIRST GRADERS SHOULD THEY RECEIVE ADULT EDUCATION SHOULD THEY RECEIVE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ABSOLUTELY BUT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE A FORTY YEAR OLD SITTING NEXT TO A FIVE YEAR OLD IN A CLASSROOM OR NOT THAT'S HAPPENING I DON'T KNOW BUT- DON'T INSIST. NOT NOT. ALL THAT WE HAVE FUNDING FOR ADULT ED SO WE WANT TO SERVE ADULTS LET'S LET'S SERVING WITH THE DAHLE TED. AN ADULT AT SERVICES NOT PUT THEM IN A FIRST GRADE CLASSROOM- ON THE ON THE- ON THE CUTS IN THE ON THE SEAT C. T. PROGRAMS- BUT WE COULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT- BUILDING IN AN AUTOMATIC CLAWBACK SHOULD FEDERAL STIMULUS MONEY COME. BECAUSE THOSE CUTS REMAIN. EVEN IF YOU GET BACK FOR WITH FEDERAL STEM MONEY PER THE LANGUAGE IN THE BUDGET NOW AS I UNDERSTAND. WHAT ELSE ARE US DISTRICTS TRICIA PROGRAM I BELIEVE THERE'S EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION FROM THE CARES ACT- HAVE WE ALREADY ALLOCATED THIS MONEY AND IS IT GOING OUT TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE QUITE FRANKLY SERVING MORE THAN JUST THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE THE MODERN DAY SUPPLY OUR SCHOOLS HAVE ENDED UP BEING THE MOPAR NAY SU PLAN THEY'RE SERVING NOT JUST K&lt;c.cyan&gt; BUT&lt;/c&gt; ENTIRE MAYES WHO NEED FOOD THE MOST BASIC NEED WE HAVE. SO CAN YOU SHARE WITH US. I'M GONNA HAVE MY AT COOLEY COOPER THE NUTRITION ASSIGNMENT COME UP. HELLO ENHANCE WOULD FINANCE- YES CALIFORNIA'S SHARE OF THAT EIGHT POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IS A SEVEN HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE BUILT INTO THE MAY REVISION AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THOSE RESOURCES WILL ULTIMATELY HAVE ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY TO BE. ABLE TO HELP OUR SCHOOL FOOD IN FLORIDA. THANK YOU WOULD THAT NECESSARILY INCLUDE FAMILIES AND OF LINED UP. FOR FOOD CURRENTLY I DON'T BELIEVE IT DOES. THAT IF WE CAN DO IT IF IT IS PERMISSIVE YOU KNOW AND FEDERAL I HOPE- ITALY'S CONTEMPLATE THAT BECAUSE AGAIN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT ALL ARE FEEDING THE ENTIRE. ARE WITH THAT- ON ON THE SPECIAL ED FUNDING- I HOPE WE CAN LOOK TOWARDS CREATING WITH WITH BUT THE GOVERNOR'S MONEY THAT IS ALLOCATED FOR THE SPECIAL ED- THAT WE COULD. POSSIBLY LOOK CREATING AWAITED FORMULA FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT SERVE MORE SPECIAL ED STUDENTS AND OTHER SOME DISTRICTS. HAVE A LOT OF SPECIAL STUDENTS WITH OTHERS SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T. THERE'S PAST PRACTICE OF DOING IT WE DO IT WITH THE CONCENTRATION. THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION CLINT GRANTS WE DO WE DO IT FOR THEM. AND IN SOME DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR. WHAT WE HAVE IS CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE COME AND THEY'RE SERVING STUDENTS ARE NOT. SPECIAL NEEDS CHILDREN. AND THAT'S A THAT THAT THAT. THAT HAVE CREATE SOME A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BURDEN ON THE DISTRICT THAT THEN DOES SERVE THE SPECIAL NEEDS CHILD SO THAT THAT SHOULD BE A POINT OF CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. SOME OTHER THINGS AS WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO CONTEMPLATE IS- REDUCE THE ROUTINE RESTRICTED THAT'S ACCOUNT. I DELAYED- DELAY INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIAL ADOPTIONS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT TAKE A LOOK AT SOME CLASS SIZE PENALTIES TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE THE LCF UPGRADE SPAN ADJUSTMENT WE MAKE WE MIGHT WANT ALLOW FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY THERE SURPLUS PROPERTY I BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE TRAILER BILL RIGHT NOW AS I UNDERSTAND IT. POTENTIALLY LOOK AT SOME PEPPERONI. SUSPENSION OF THAT SO THE TEACHERS CAN RETIRE MAKE YOUR- SOME PROGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL OF SUSPEND MANDATES THE START TIME BILL RIGHT PROBABLY THE WORST BILL OF MY TENURE HERE- FORCING SCHOOLS TO STARTED A CERTAIN TIMES CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE I'M HEARING FROM DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT THAT. IT'S GOING TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE TO IMPLEMENT THAT- INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS WE HEARD THAT WE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THE DISTRICTS CAN GO HYBRID WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS- SOME DISTRICTS ARE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE A HYBRID WHERE THEY MIGHT GO MONDAY WEDNESDAY FRIDAY ONE WEEK TUESDAY THURSDAY THEM ACT EXTEND THE OTHER KIDS FEEL ON THE OTHER DAYS. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS HAVE THE- THE ABILITY TO- TO- TO GO HYBRID IF THEY NEED TO FOR SAFETY REASONSALONG- WITH THAT I THINK THAT IS ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. AND I'VE SAID MY PIECE MISTER CHAIR BACK TO YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I KNOW WE DO HAVE A LOT OF. PUBLIC COMMENT AS WELL. ON THE K. TWELVE PIECE BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GET INTO THE EARLY EDUCATION. MAY REVISED PROPOSALS- WHICH ARE ARE JUST AS- PROBLEMATIC BUT MAY HAVE A MORE LASTING IMPACT SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE LA- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND CD. TO GO OVER THE E. C. E. MAY REVISED PROPOSALS. GREAT SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE ON THE HANDOUT THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU- ONE ON PAGE- OF THE HANDOUT. BUT BEFORE THE MAJOR IT PAPA BEGIN. OF THE APPROACH OF THE EARLY FOR THEIR THE FIRST THING IS RATES SO- FOR THE BATTERIES PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. TO BE A TO WHAT'S TO WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY RECEIVING- FOR THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE THAT DIRECT CONTACT PROGRAMS LIKE GENERAL CHECKERED STATE PRESCHOOL. OF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTING ADJUSTMENTS ME THAT WAS- INCLUDED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET WOULD BE RESCINDED AND THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL 10% REDUCTION- BOTH OF THESE PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL TRICKLING WHICH SO THEY ALSO WOULD BE. LIKE I'LL SEE AFFECT SOME OF THE CATEGORICAL CONNECTION IF THERE IS NOT A MONEY THOSE. THOSE CUTS WOULD BE RESCINDED. I'M THE NEXT IS THE REDUCTION IN PRESCHOOL SLOTS SO THE ADMIN AND- IS HAD INITIALLY ARE TO OF THOUSANDS THE- START TEN THOUSAND PRESCHOOL. ABOUT THE J. PULLED BOTH A THOUSAND HAVE BEEN RISK. NOT BEEN- ALLOCATED ACROSS THE STATE- THAT ADDS UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL PROPPING THE GENERAL FUND AND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE MILLION. ARE NOT NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND A REDUCTIONS TO STAY PRICKLES LOTS THE NEXT. THING THAT'S UNDERNEATH THAT ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS THAT WERE IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET- BUT THE BIGGEST APART THE FUNDING WERE UP FUNDING FOR- EARLY EDUCATION TUCKER FACILITIES- OR FOR FACILITY CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION. AND THEN- FUNDING FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- THOSE WERE ONE TIME FUNDING FUNDS PROVIDED IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SPENT YESAND THOSE FOLKS HAVE BEEN TAKING BACK INCOME WILL BE SWEPT IF THIS IS APPROVED. AND THERE'S ALSO TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR. A MEDINA TO START THE E. THAT FUNDING THAT IS ALSO BEEN REMOVED MAYOR VISION. FINALLY THE OTHER. ARE THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD AT HERE IS THAT IS A OF. A CAN. OF A PROPOSAL TO RE ORGANIZE- SORT OF CHAKRA PROGRAMS THE JANUARY PROPOSAL WAS TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT- THAT WOULD BE WITHIN THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THE PROPOSAL HAS NOT BEEN MODIFIED TO BE TO SHIFT- IS STILL SENDING WORRIED SHIFTING ALL OF THE ROGER PROGRAMS AND- GENERAL CHOCOLATE. I'M INTO A NEW PLACE BUT INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. I'M THE NEXT PAGE WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DIRECTLY FROM AUGMENTATIONS IN THE MIRROR VISION. AND THIS IS THE- DUE TO- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT PART THE FUNDING HERE. ONE IS AN ONGOING- CHAO KERN DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT AGMENTATION AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. I THINK THE STATE OF NEW THAT THEY GOT A WORD OF THIS AT THE END OF DECEMBER AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ENTER THE INGREDIENTS THE JANUARY BUDGET- BUT NOW THAT THE CORPORATION OF THE MARRIAGE ANNOUNCES FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL. ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT DOCTORS. I'M DOT NEXT PART IS AT. THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT IT ONE TIME- CCTV DEFINING THAT THE STATE RECEIVED AS PART OF BURKE CARES ACT. AND THAT'S DISTRIBUTED AND THERE ARE THREE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO USE THAT FUNDING. THE FIRST IS A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO COVER THE CURRENT YEAR COSTS. OF THE OPEN NINETY NOW BREAKS SO- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF X. EXECUTIVE ORDERS IT'S AN ACTIONS- AND SOME ARE. BURNT THE LETTERS THAT PROVIDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOUR PP- FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- TO- A PROVIDES EMERGENCY VOUCHERS FOR SINCE WORKERS. AND IN A VARIETY OF POLICY CHANGES THAT TRACTOR RIGHT THE MORE FISCAL RELIEF TO FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS. CANDLES ARE ADDING UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION. I THE REMAINING IF THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT USES. OF THE REMAINING FUND HI AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION I WOULD BE. FOR PROVIDERS BASED ON NUMBER OF SUCH AS CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE SERVING. AND THEN SEVENTY THREE MILLION FOR SOME ADDITIONAL- TEMPORARY ALTERNATIVE THE MINIATURES. SO NOW GOING TO THE NEXT PAGE TALKING OUR COVERAGE OF OUR OVERALL COMMENTS HERE. AGAIN FOR MOST OF THE KEY TWELVE- TRUCK WITH THEM HE TOLD WORLD I THINK WE WERE JUST A HIGHLIGHT HERE AGAIN. THAT THE PROPOSAL HERE JUST ASSUMES THAT WE CAN TO GO BACK TO THE WORLD AS IT WAS BEFORE THERE'S NOTHING. HERE SIR CONTEMPLATING WHETHER AT THE EMERGENCY ORDERS THAT WERE IN PLACE WERE TO CONTINUE- AND WHAT PROVIDERS WORK TO DO IF WE DON'T END UP BAKER GOING BACK TO NORMAL. I'M JUST- AS A REFRESHER WHEN THE STATE DID- CREATED EMERGENCY THERE'S A VARIETY OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS AND MANAGEMENT BOLTON'S. THAT ON CERTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR- CHALKER PROVIDERS ONE OF THEM IS TO LIMIT GROUP SIZES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT- ARE AT OR NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CLASSROOM SIZES WHICH SOMETHING THAT. HAVE BEEN YOU NEED NO MATTER WHAT SIZE YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN A THIRD NUMBER pMORE ADULTS PER STUDENT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ANY PARTICULAR. AREA OF THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT WERE NECESSARY TO DEAL WITH- THE COVER NINETEEN OUTBREAK BUT THE DO PLACE A LOT. ON. SO NOT ARE HAVING THE KITCHEN BUT WHAT. WITH THE CIVIC BEFORE IMPORTANT FRIEND OR- BAREFOOT SITUATE. I'M WE WOULD SAY ON THE ON THE- TO REDUCE OUR VOUCHERS 10% ACROSS BOARD AT THE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THIS WOULD DOES NOT- DOES NOT ALIGNED WITH THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE. THAT'S THE WAY THAT THESE- RATES ARE STEP ACROSS THE STATE- BY DOING ACROSS THE BORDER ACTION AS OPPOSED TO SAY MOVING TO A DIFFERENT PERCENT ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE MEANS THAT FAMILIES WILL HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ACCESS TO THEIR PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE SO. IN SOME CASES THAT 10% REDUCTION MADE STILL MEAN THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PROVIDERS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE VOUCHER FOR IN OTHER CASES THAT MIGHT BE SEVERELY LIMITED AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE REDUCTION BE MADE. BY TAKING IT TO A TO THE LOWER PERCENTILE IN SERVICE. I'M IN IN TERMS OF- BUT WE HAVE A FEW OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF MINIMIZING RATE REDUCTIONS. WE WERE NOT THAT THERE ARE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDS THAT ARE SCHEDULED TO. OUR GO OUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FOR NEW GENERAL TUCKER SLOTS. ARE BOTH THAT FUNDING COULD POTENTIALLY BE REPURPOSE TO BE USED TO MITIGATE THE- NINETY RATE. RATE REDUCTIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING- AND ALTHOUGH WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WOULD BE LESS CHILDREN SIR. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF PROVIDERS TO STAY IN BUSINESS IF THEY'RE FACING A LOT OF COST PRESSURES AND FOR MAKING REDUCTIONS- TO THE RATES- THE LEGISLATURE ALSO COULD CONSIDER SOME OTHER- REDUCTIONS THAT DO NOT. GO DIRECTLY DO NOT ADDRESS SERVICES SUCH AS- THE ADMIN COSTS FOR ABOUT YOUR PROGRAMS. OR THE- THE PRESCHOOL ALREADY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM. I'M WE WERE NOT ALSO IF THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN FAVOR DO THING THE NUMBER. OF SLOTS IN SOME WAY WE WOULD RECOMMEND DOING THAT BASED ON THE IN. REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ABILITY THRESHOLD SO WE'RE STILL PRIORITIZING. CHILDREN WITH THE HIGHEST NEED. AND FAMILIES WITH ITS NEED- COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS WOULD MAKE REGARDING THAT ONE TIME FUNDING FROM THE CARES ACT WE RECOMMEND USING ALL THAT FOR. THE FIRST TAPINGS AGAIN RECOGNIZING THAT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST PRESSURES THAT PROVIDERS. WILL BE FACING. ARE WE THINK ARE USING THAT ENTIRE THE HUNDRED AND- RATHER THAN JUST BEING ONE THIRTY FIVE. I'M NOT DOING ALL OF. THE AS- FUNDING DIRECTLY PERSPECTIVES TYPE IN THE PROVIDING RELIEF FIGHTERS WOULD BE- PREFERABLE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE- THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED- FOR EMERGENCY DOCTORS IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THAT SPENT. AND SO WE THINK THAT ONE ALTERNATIVE TO PROVIDING THAT SEVENTY THREE MILLION- FOR ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY VOUCHERS IS TO MOVE AT THE STATE AND- THEN JUST ALLOW THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS. INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR- THROUGH A SECTION THAT OFFICE TO ALLOW THAT TO BE USED FOR. THE BUDGET YEARS WELL. AND FINALLY WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND REJECT. IN THE PROPOSALS FOR REORGANIZATION- WE HAVE CONCERNS. IN IN THE INITIAL PROPOSAL WE CAN YOU HAVE. I'M CONCERNED THE ONGOING COSTS OF THE- OR OF THE- WE ARE. IS NOT CLEAR. WE ALSO WOULD NOT. BY SHIFTING PROGRAM THE DF RIGHT NOW ME BE PRETTY DIFFICULT COULD THREE THAT THERE RIGHT NOW ARE PROJECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT HE FILLED IN- VIRTUALLY ALL THE DEFENSE PROGRAMS. SO WITH MAYBE A DIFFICULT TIME FOR ADMINISTRATIVELY THAT CHANGE TO OCCUR. SOFT UP THERE- AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEAH ONLY THREE GIVE IT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- EVER DID A VERY GOOD JOB OF LAYING OUT OF THE PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN THE NAY REVISION SO I WON'T GO INTO DETAIL- BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW OVERALL- BEHIND THIS PROPOSAL IS THE COMMITMENT TO TRY TO RETAIN ACCESS WHICH IS WHY YOU SEE ACTUALLY THE RATE REDUCTION AS OPPOSED ANY REDUCTION TO- SLOTS OR- ACCESS- WE TRIED TO DO THIS IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE WAS BY FINDING EFFICIENCIES SWEEPING STATE IN SWEEPING UNUSED- SLOTS IN THE PRESCHOOL AND ACTUALLY PUTTING THE POTS ON THE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND- EXPAND.

SO WITH THAT- LET'S PUT IT. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR THERE NEVER MORGAN AGAIN DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT AT TONY THURMOND SO I ALREADY WENT OVER A LITTLE BIT THAT GREAT DECREASE IN THE PROJECT TO EARLY LEARNING CARE WHICH IS FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO MILLION THIRTEEN PERCENT. FROM IN TWENTY PROJECT WE ARE CONCERNED BY. INTEGRAL ROLE WE KNOW QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE PLAYS AND SUPPORTING A STRONG ECONOMY IT PROVIDES ESSENTIAL CHILD CARE TO WORKING FAMILIES AND IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN ESPECIALLY ITS MOST VULNERABLE I WON'T GO INTO DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL SINCE FINANCE AN ALLEY OUR PARTY COVER THEM BUT I DO WANT TO THE LATE TWO OR THREE MAIN THINGS. FIRST ONE I THINK LED TO IN MINUTES XIN THE PARTNERSHIP FAR AND HELPING US THE DRESS CODE NINETEEN ISSUES AS THEY HAVE ARISEN WE ARE SHAPE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES THE CITY SEE THAT ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND- FIVE. FOR PAYMENTS WE ALL PRE THE INCLUSION OF THE EIGHT MILLION IN THE MAY REVISED TO WAYS WAY FAMILY FEES THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY AS WE KNOW A LOT OF OUR FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING. WELL I UNDERSTAND THE FISCAL IT. SITUATION THE STATE FIND AT SOUTH THEN WE ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT THE EIGHT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IN SAVINGS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS. RUNS COUNTER TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL OF SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE AND SHORING UP PROVIDER SOLVENCY TO ENSURE THE STATE'S CHILD CARE SYSTEM SURVIVES THIS CRISIS. OUR PROGRAMS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH RATE AT BARELY ALLOWED THEM TO STAY AFLOAT. FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET RATE PROPOSAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OR C. F. P. P. THE RATES WERE FOUR THOUSAND LESS PER YEAR THAN WHAT THE STATE CURRENTLY PAYS FOR VOUCHER CENTER BASED PRESCHOOL. BASED ON A MARKET RATE SURVEY MANY PROVIDERS HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO APPLY FOR PRESCHOOL EXPANSION FUNDS IN THE PAST CITING THESE LOW RATES AND IN IN ABOUT. SPEAKER SPACE AND HE TEACHERS AT THE OFFERED RATE. ADDITIONALLY DUE TO COPE IN NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTIVES. WERE REDUCING CHILD CARE CAPACITY SO IT COSTS MORE TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PROGRAMS THAT IT WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN THOUSAND HUNDRED PER CLASSROOM. TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE COVER NINETEEN ISSUES. THE PROPOSED TO THE FIELD IN RESULT IN MANY PROVIDERS GOING OUT OF BUSINESS. AND CRITICAL LC CAPACITY IN LOST CAPACITY THAT IS ESSENTIAL FIRST ECONOMIC RECOVERY AS CALIFORNIANS HEAD BACK TO WORK. AND WE NEED TO KICK START OUR ECONOMY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE PROPOSED MECHANISM OF THE RATE CAPS WILL GREAT INEQUITIES AND HOW FAMILIES CAN ACCESS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THROUGH VOUCHERS ACROSS THE STATE. AN IMPACT FAMILIES LIVING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE DIFFERENTLY. CURRENTLY ALL FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO AT LEAST 75% OF PROVIDERS IN YOUR AREA. HOWEVER AS A RESULT OF THE RATE AT. SOME PARTS OF THE STATE WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCESS FORTY TWO. OF THEIR CHILD PROVIDER. THE BATTERY WELL EITHER. WITH BE ABLE TO ACCESS HUNDRED FOR. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION AND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO HELP IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE COST SAVINGS TO THE SYSTEM SAID THAT THESE DROUGHT DRAMATIC CUTS CAN BE AVOIDED IF CALIFORNIA RECEIVES NO ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDING. AND THAT SAME VEIN WE ARE ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIFTEEN POINT 4% CUTS TO THE ASUS PROGRAM. AT A MINIMUM WE MUST PRESERVE THE EIGHT DOLLARS AN EIGHTY EIGHT DAILY RATE EEN IF WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION. IF WE REDUCE THE RATE WHILE ALSO HAVING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN INCREASE MINIMUM WAGE OUR PROGRAMS WOULD HAVE TO SERVE THE SAME NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH 15% LESS SPENDING. PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY STAFF AND WILL HAVE TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS LEADING FAMILIES WHO HAVE. WITHOUT THESE CRITICAL PROGRAMS JUST AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED THEM TO ADDRESS THE EARLY LEARNING SIDE FOR THE LEARNING SIDE AND- WORKING FAMILIES. FINALLY WE WANT AT THE CONCERN OF THAT ON PROPOSAL SHIFT SOME OF THE- CAR. IN EARLY CARE. AS WELL AS THE CHILD ADULT FOOD PROGRAM OVER TO DFS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT COME. OKAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF- HAVE QUESTIONS- HERE FOR CD E. AND PARTMINER FINANCE LA L. WE JUST KINDA GET ORGANIZED HERE. I JUST WANTED TO START. OUT OF THE GATE THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL- COMPONENT EVERY OPENING OUR ECONOMY WE KNOW THE WORKERS ARE ESSENTIAL THE SAID OVER AND OVER- BUYER GOVERNOR. AND WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A VERY FRAGILE FIELD AND WHAT WE DO HERE CAN BOOST IT UP OR CONVERSELY CAN REALLY- YOU KNOW FRANKLY BUT THE DEATH KNELL AUDI CENTERS. AND THERE'S A REALLY POWERFUL ARTICLE LAST WEEK BY A WOMAN NAMED EMILY PACK WROTE A COLUMN AND- INTRO LINE I THINK SAYS IT ALL IT SAYS. OUR CENTER. A BIG MONEY MAKER BEST OF TIMES BUT RUNNING ONE DURING A PANDEMIC IS BASICALLY LIKE TAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY AND SETTING IT ON FIRE SO THAT'S THE REALITY. AND IF WE LOWER- THEIR RATIOS FAMILIES KIDS CAN BE IN A SITES IF WE DECREASE- OF THAT THE RATES IT HAS FRANKLY- AN OPPORTUNITY HERE YOU KNOW- TO- ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM FOR NON THESE CENTERS BUT FOR US TO. REOPEN OUR ECONOMY SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE KNOW THIS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE ALREADY STATE STATED THAT THE WORKERS IN THE FIELD ARE PART OF THE CENTURY OPENING OF CALIFORNIA THEN PEOPLE BACK TO WORK THINKING ABOUT HERE IN MY OWN. DISTRICT ALL OF MY STATE WORKERS. WE CAN GET TO WORK- PART OF THAT IS MAKING SURE THEY HAVE A PLACE TO PUT THEIR KIDS WE- IS. BUDGET AND MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT IN PROP UP C. SENSE PART OF OUR ECONOMY. HELLO LISA RESIDENTS GARY ABOUT WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT YEAH YOU MUCH AS YOU KNOW THESE ARE-VERY VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS THAT WE HAD TO MAKE- AND CUTTING THE BUDGET AND WE TRY TO BE AS- EQUITABLE AND THE DECISIONS IN THESE REDUCTIONS SO. I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WERE LOOKING FOR MORE DATA ON UNDERSTANDING THE CLOSURES WHO IS GOING TO RE OPEN AND WHAT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS LOOK LIKE AS WE GO INTO THE SUMMER MONTHS AND WE WILL AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD WITH.WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AND KIND OF- MAKING SOME OF THESE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. THE I'M SORRY. ARE YOU FINISHED YES OKAY SO I GUESS THAT THAT THE ANTHONY AGAIN IS. ADD ALL THESE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU'RE WELCOME BACK TO THAT. DO WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US WILL ALLOW US TO KEEP THE- THE GRADUAL CHILD CARE NETWORK GOING IN CALIFORNIA. ESSENTIALLY IF WE HAVE TO FACE THE TRIGGER CUTS AND I'LL GET TO THIS IN A LITTLE BIT THAT THAT THE RATE REDUCTIONS DO WE THINK THAT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO STAY IN BUSINESS KNOWING THAT IN THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS ALWAYS FRAGILE. POTENTIALLY HAVING TO SEARCH. FOR A KIDS- WITH THE NEW. US SAFETY RATIOS. WITH GLASS OF THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT. DO WE THINK THAT THAT THE CENTERS WILL. STAY OPEN. AND BE ABLE TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL CERTAINLY ASSUMES THAT THERE WILL BE THAT THEY WILL STAY OPEN WITH THE LOWER RATES AND WE'RE HOPING THAT- WITH ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT THE AT LEAST THE TEN PERCENT. RATE REDUCTIONS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE TRIGGER CUTS WILL WILL NOT HAVE TO TAKE PLACE. OKAY AND AGAIN THAT GETS BACK TO THAT THE ISSUE WE SPOKE AT THE VERY BEGINNING IS THAT. WE REALLY DON'T HAVE AN ADEQUATE PLAN BEER PLAN AND CAN IF IN THE END THE- SCENARIO THAT THE FEDERAL. SECONDARY FEDERAL. CARES PROPOSAL- PET IT DOESN'T MATERIALIZE FOR CALIFORNIA SO I WANT TO ASK NOW ABOUT THE OTHER- POTS OF MONEY THAT WE'RE WE ALLOCATED FOR K. TWELVE EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT THE FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION GOING TO- LEARNING LOSS AND THERE'S THE OTHER FOUR BILLION ELSEWHERE- AT WHY HAVEN'T SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES BEING. A BEEN PUT FORTH TO SUPPORT AND PROP UP THIS INDUSTRY WHICH WE KNOW IS SO CRITICAL TO GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK AND SUPPORTING- THE WORK FORCE IN THIS FIELD. WELL WE HAVE THE GREATER FIFTY MILLION WHICH IS DEDICATED TO THE CARE STOCKS FOR- CCTV JEEZ SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT. THE OTHER FUNDING- AGAIN AS YOU KNOW THERE'S- IT'S GOING TO SHORT CUTS AND KATE TWELVE AND OTHER SITES THE BUDGET SO. I REALLY WASN'T INVOLVED IN A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION FUNDS PUTTING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS THAT BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE WORK. WE HAVE THE CARE TAX MONEY THAT WE WERE. I COUNTY. OKAY. LET'S GO NOW TO AND I'LL COME BACK IN THE SECOND FOR THE ASUS PROGRAM. THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE A RATE REDUCTION BACK DOWN TO THE INITIAL PROPERTY NINE LEVELS OF SEVEN SEVEN FIFTY A DAY DO WE THINK THAT WILL ALLOW THE PROGRAMS TO STAY OPEN OR WERE THEY ALSO SERVE FEWER KIDS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE AMOUNT MENTIONED IN OUR OUR SO GO. THE REDUCTION IS REALLY AT. FOR JUST RATE REDUCTION AND NOT NECESSARY BUT WITH SOME REALLY THE SLOTS BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY KEEP AN EYE ON LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT PROGRAM. YOU KNOW LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET. WE TRY TO INCREASE AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING THROUGH PROP SIXTY FOR THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. A MEASURE AND UNDERSTOOD THAT WE HAD TO MAKE A TRADE OFF AND SO WE USE THOSE RESOURCES TO EXPAND. CHILDCARE SLOTS AND ONE OF THE PROPOSALS THE EP DOCTORS LOTS RIGHT. YES YEAH AND SO YOU CAN YEAH AND CHAPTER YEAH THAT IS A LOT OF THE YOU KNOW KIDS OF COURSE ARE SCHOOL AGE SO WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THAT IS A TRADE OFF. GRANTED THAT THE L. THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE TALKED ABOUT HOW TO GO TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. THE PROPOSAL THAT THE LA GO LAYS OUT IS THAT WE COULD USE THOSE MONIES. TO SHORE UP THE RATES. IN LIEU OF THE EXPANSION OF SLOTS IF THE TRIGGER IS KICKING IN WE DON'T GET THE FEDERAL MONEY. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK WE OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERING I GUESS YOU'RE- LITERALLY ARE. ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL SLOTS AND RATES ARE IMPORTANT BUT- AS- SIR NOBLE MORGAN MENTIONED. IT IF. PEOPLE WERE BARELY PICKING UP. THE SLOTS IN THE FIRST PLACE WITH WITH THE RATES AND IF YOU REDUCING EVEN MORE DOES THAT DOES THAT REALLY JUST YOU KNOW. HAVE EVERYTHING CRATER AND HOW THE PROGRAMS FALL APART. I WOULD HAVE CONCERNED WITH THAT USE WITH THE PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDING I WOULD DEFINITELY NEED TO GO BACK AND RE READ THE LANGUAGE WITH SOME OF- MARK ARE EXPERTS. IN PROP SIXTY FOUR BACK AT FINANCE BUT. OKAY I GUESS ONE OF THE THAT THE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IS THAT WE KNOW THAT. THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE- STRUCTURE FOR ALLOF OUR EASY PROGRAMS FOR CHILD CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL IT'S- IT'S IT IS VARIABLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. IT'S DEMONSTRATED THAT IT'S- INADEQUATE BY USING THAT THE SURVEYS FROM THAT ARE COUPLE YEARS OLD. AS YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO PROPOSALS IN THE LEGISLATURE AB ONE IS ONE THE SENATE. TO REFORM THIS AND INCREASE TAKE MAKE SURE THAT THE THESE PROGRAMS CAN STAY HALL AND FRANKLY EXPANDED SERVE MORE KIDS. SO THE QUESTION THAT WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES IS IF YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE TRIGGER GOES INTO A FACT WHAT WILL THIS MEAN DO WE DO WE REALLY THINK THAT THAT THESE PROGRAMS WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE OR WERE THEY CLOSE. THEIR DOORS AND SO AGAIN I ASK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF WE HADN'T DO THESE 10% CUTS IF WE HAD TO GO AND PULL THE TRIGGER BECAUSE THERE'S NO FEDERAL BAILOUT. WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN THERE ARE PROGRAMS ARE EASY PATCHWORK OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN- THE CHILD CARE WORLD IN THE AND IT'S PART DAY PRESCHOOL IN FULL DAY PRE SCHOOL. I REALLY DON'T HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT I CAN'T I CAN'T PROJECT WHAT THIS WILL BE IT'S NOT OUR INTENT THAT WITH OUR INTENT WAS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS- I KNOW THE MASTER PLAN FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE IS CONTINUING THEIR EFFORTS AND WE'RE HOPING THATA WITH WHAT THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT THERE WILL BE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS- MOVING FORWARD. WITH THAT THE MASTER PLAN. YES YEAH WELL I KNOW THAT THE MASTER PLAN AT ISSUE MORE NOT LESS AND SO IT'S OUR GREAT FEAR THAT THAT THE WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER AND ONE. THESE THESE PROGRAMS PEOPLE TO WORK IN THIS FIELD WOULD POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW LOSE THEIR LIVELIHOOD LOSE THEIR JOBS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY. WE LOSE PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS AND GET BACK TO WORK AND SO YOU KNOW MY FRIEND OVER HERE MISTER GALLAGHER SAYS THE ONE THING THAT WE NEED TO DO. TO FIX OUR ECONOMY ISRAEL BUT ECONOMY PEOPLE BACK TO WORK BUT HOW CAN PEOPLE COULD GET BACK TO WORK IF THEY HAVE NO PLACE TO SEND THEIR KIDS DURING THE DAY. WELL THAT'S OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOL SYSTEM. FOR OUR CHILD CARE CENTERS AND EAT AND COURSES ARE SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS BUT WE KNOW A LOT OF THEM A BLIND BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN. AND PRIVATE PAY AND SUBSIDIZE AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT GREAT CONCERN. ABOUT IS THAT WE NEED TO. ONE THINK ABOUT IT THERE A PLAN B. TO MITIGATE. POTENTIAL TRIGGER CUTS OR- IF THAT DOESN'T COME THROUGH. YOU KNOW. THE OTHER DISCRETIONARY MONIES THAT ARE IN ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET I KNOW THAT. WHATEVER ACTION WE TAKE SOMEWHERE ELSE HAS THE IMPACTS SOMEBODY ELSE AS WELL BUT THIS IS SUCH A KEY. PIECE OF OUR- OF GETTING OUR ECONOMY BACK IN ORDER- OKAY NEXT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT. THE SHIFT TO. DS S. AND- I THINK WE HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. IN JANUARY QUICK CREATING ITS OWN DEPARTMENT. AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY. HE WAS A LITTLE BIT TAKE HINGED. WHERE AND I WOULD. MORE THIRTY DAY AND SO. THE QUESTION IS DO WE THINK THAT'S ESSENTIAL. TO CREATE. TO DO THE SHOW. THAT THAT. OCCUR PRO. IS FROM. CITY TO DEPARTMENT ALSO SERVE. IN IN LARGE PART. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A- THAT. SHIFT IN IT AND THAT IN A- THIS TIME RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT WE'RE- STEADY AND- LEADERSHIP IN THIS. ANYWAY AND THEN SECONDLY IS AT. BUT TO ME. HOW HE SAID MONIES THAT. THAT THE PROBING DURING THE NINETEEN PARA. IT IS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED YESAND WE DO BY IT IS AND IN ORDER TO A ON THIS THE PROBE ENERGY GOING FORWARD. ON THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS IS QUITE FLEXIBLE THAT'S JUST TO START THE TRANSITION- AND- THE- THE DETAILS OF THE REMAINDER OF THE PLAN ARE IN ANOTHER- AGENCIES SO- UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HAVING BACK TO BACK. HEARINGS TO THE FOLKS THAT COULD PROBABLY GIVE YOU A LOT MORE DETAILS ON THAT ARE IN. A SOMEWHAT RIGHT NOW AND ALSO IN THE FULL SENATE HEARING. ALRIGHT WE MIGHT WITH THE NAKED. EYE COOLEY OPEN- ON THE LINE TO. ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS AS WELL. YEAH HEY YOU'RE HEARING YES ALL TO GO BACK TO SOME OF YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS SO- WOULD WANT ONE WAS. THE POLICY THAT I BROUGHT UP EARLIER AS FAR AS THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR THE MARIHUANA TAX RESOURCES AT LAST YEAR WENT TO THOSE AT P. P. DOT JUST FIVE EXPANSION AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE COULD CONSIDER USING THOSE. FOR RATE STABILIZATION YOU WANNA TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. IF THAT'S RIGHT TO OUR UNDERSTANDING YOU KNOW- LAST YEAR THE BUDGET- THERE WAS FIFTY MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING PROVIDED I'M FOR THE GENERAL TALKER PROGRAM THAT WAS THE TEND TO BE FOR FUNDING FOR THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. AND I WAS INTENDED TO SORT OF GET STARTED THE FIFTY MILLION IN WORTH OF SLOTH I WOULD THAT BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE BE FUNDED WITH PROP SIXTY FOUR FUNDING. ARE WE NEED A PROXY FOR FUNDING WAS COMING BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WELL OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE FUNDS OVER THERE WITH THAT- ARE OF A PROCESS AND- APPLICATIONS WERE RECEIVED AND SCORED NONE OF THOSE LAWS HAVE BEEN OUT THERE NOBODY HAVE BEEN AWARDED THE SLOTS NONE OF THEIR- OR A- ANNOUNCES. DIRT THOSE WATER TO STILL NOT. NUMBER WHO'S WHO THINK THAT THEY'RE GETTING THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT THIS IS TYPICALLY NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD WANT TO DO WITH THAT AND SAY WELL THAT'S NOT- LET'S NOT A WARD OF THE SLOTS EVEN THE PEOPLE OF GOD AND PLIED- FORTY FIVE BUT WE DO THINK GIVEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE REDUCTION TO TEN PERCENT. RATE REDUCTION THAN GIVEN ALREADY THE COST PRESSURES THE PROVIDER ARE FEELING RIGHT NOW THAT RATHER THAN ISSUING THE SLOTS WHICH RIGHT NOW ARE STILL NOT THERE'S NOT THEIR OWN FAMILY THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE ARE DIRECTLY HARMING BY DOING THIS BUT INSTEAD OF REDIRECTING THOSE FUNDS TO HELP STATE REDUCE THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE RATE THAT'S WHAT HELPED. THEY BY FOR PROVIDERS AND AVOID. SOME OF THEM I MEAN CLOTHES. YEAH SO IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS POTENTIALLY THERE ARE FIVE THOUSAND FAMILIES ON A WAITING LIST THAT DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE CHILD CARE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GET IT. WITH THESE PROP SIXTY FOUR MONIES OF LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION SO THAT THEY'RE NOT LOSING ANYTHING THAT THEY DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE RIGHT NOW. BUT PRESSURES NOTHING BUT CONVERSELY IF YOU HAVE A- DISASTROUS A RATE REDUCTION THERE'S TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES COULD THEY COULD GET KICKED OUT SO IT'S LIKE YOU'RE NOT CALLING FAMILIES A HEY YOU WANT YOU GOT A SPACE BUT THE FLIP SIDE YOU'RE CALLING. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES AND SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE CENTERS CLOSE DWN I'M SORRY SO. I THINK IT'S JUST THE RISK REWARD ANALYSIS WE NEED TO DO WHAT'S THE BEST USE THAT AND IT'S PAINFUL TO BECAUSE YOU'RE- ROBBING PETER TO PAY PAUL THEY'RE BOTH- CHILD CARE. ACCESS BUT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS YOU KNOW AT WHAT WHAT WOULD HAVE THE BIGGEST. IMPACT AND FRANKLY THE BIGGEST NEGATIVE IMPACT RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S KIND OF A CONSISTENT FROM A RECOMMENDATION SIMILARLY WHERE WE RECOMMEND TAKING THE FUNDING FOR TEMPORARY VOUCHERS INSTEAD USING IT PERSPECTIVES. I AM AGAINST THE MOTHERLY CONCERN ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE CUTS TO PROVIDERS AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR THEIR- LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. SO WHAT THE WE RECOGNIZE. ALWAYS WANTING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACTORS IMPORTANT WE ARE CONCERNED- ABOUT THESE COST PRESSURES PARTICULAR RIGHT NOW GIVEN. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT ARE GONE AS WERE INDEPENDENT. YET MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS AT YOUR BECAUSE IT'S LIKE A GAME OF CHESS RIGHT YOU MOVE ONE PIECE AND- HAS AN IMPACT OVER HERE AND THEN. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL RIGHT. SO HAVE. YOU YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY CONSIDERED PULLING THIS- HE COULD CONSIDER GOING ON THIS PATH. IF WE DIDN'T GET THE FEDERAL MONEY BUT WHEN DO WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE WERE TRYING TO. PUT OUR BUDGET TOGETHER AND HAVE IT READY TO VOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR IN. TWO WEEKS OR SO AND WHAT THE TIME LINE FOR US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S HAPPENING THE FEDERAL LEVEL- TO MAKE THIS DECISION. RIGHT I THOUGHT OBVIOUSLY A VERY DIFFICULT ON GIVEN THAT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO. NO WORK HERE THE YOU KNOW THIS IS THESE TRIGGERS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SAY FOR EXAMPLE TRIGGERS OUT THE STATE IMPLEMENTED- OR OR ENACTED WHEN WE PUT PROP THIRTY ON THE BALLOT AT LEAST THERE WAS SOME VERY CLEAR CERTAINTY ABOUT. IT IS WHAT HAPPENS IF WE IF THE MEASURE FAILED WITH WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MEASURE PASSES HERE THEY'RE SORT OF LIKE THE STATE COULD GIVE ZERO TWO WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH FUNDING TO BACK OF THESE TRIGGERS THAT DOES CREATE SOME UNCERTAINTY- IN DECIDING HOW TO HOW YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. YEAH OKAY AND THEN. HOW HOW DOES THIS- PLAY OUT WITH. MAYBE THIS IS FOR CD FOR SERRA THAT MORGAN RIGHT THERE HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT WITH THESE LOWER CHILD TO ADULT RATIOS IN THE SMALLER GROUP SIZES AS THE ELLIE TALKS ABOUT IT HOW DOES THIS. HOW DOES MAKE THESE. WHETHER IT'S A FAMILY FAMILY BASED- HOME OR A CENTER. HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT PENCIL OUT FINANCIALLY. SEVEN THIS IS THERE IT DOESN'T REALLY PENCIL OUT SO IT WILL MEAN INCREASED COSTS FOR THE PROGRAM SAID THEY HAVE DONE A SURVEY AND I'M SURE YOU'LL ACTUALLY GET SOME PUBLIC COMMENT IN A LITTLE BIT THAT ADDRESSES THAT BETTER THAN I WELL. BUT SOME OF WHAT THEY PROVIDED TO US IS THE ELEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED COED COSTS PER CLASSROOM AND NOT 43% INCREASE COSTS DUE TO THOSE REDUCE GROUPS ACCESS SO YOU HAVE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO COME IN AND ADDRESS THOSE- SMALLER GRIP SIZES AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU'RE HAVING TO DO PRETTY INTENSE CLEANING EVERY DAY THAT INCREASES COSTS. IN STAFF TIME AS WELL WE HAD AN EXAMPLE FROM ONE OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES THAT THE 10% CUT WILL COST THEM SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE CLEANING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND SO ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY WOULD LOSE IN ONE YEAR AS THEY IF THEY WERE ABLE TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD WITH. HAVING OUR PROGRAMS. YES SO IT KIND OF WHAT I SAID EARLIER THAT IN THE BEST OF TIMES THESE ARE. ALLOCATE BUSINESSES AND THEY THEY THEY CAN BARELY HANG ON AND DURING THIS ERA. THE QUOTE WAS IT'S LIKE TAKING A BUNCH OF MONEY IN SETTING A FIRE NOT SAYING THAT'S WHAT TALK IS THAT IS ARE WE BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY DO WHAT WE DON'T TO HAPPEN OF COURSE SO. WITH THE RATE CUT AND ATTENTION LEADS DOLE TO CHILD RATIOS WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD HAPPEN AT THE CENTERS. I DON'T THINK MY CENTERS COULD CONTINUE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL FINDS TO DO THAT'S I THINK YOU QUOTED SOMEBODY IS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN THIS FOR THE MONEY SO WE SEE ALL THE TIME THAT FROM OUR CONTRACTORS WHO WE WORK WITH. HOW CLOSE TO THE EDGE THEY ARE AND ACTUALLY OUR FISCAL STAFF HAVE TO GIVE A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FIELD AROUND HOW TO STAY SOLVENT AND SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY ARE HAVE THE CURRENT RATES AND WEREN'T HAVING ADDRESS A SMALLER GRIP SIZES. RATIOS AND ENHANCE CLEANING WE KNOW IT WILL BE MORE CRIME PROBLEMATIC MOVING FORWARD AND COVERED NINETEEN WORLD. YES SO I THINK THAT THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS THERE'S- I THINK THE CENTERS OF PROBABLY ASK FOR MORE RESOURCES. YOU KNOW WE BAIL OUT CERTAIN PLACES IN THE- IN THE ECONOMY AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL NOT TOO MUCH HERE WE CAN'T PRINT MONEY. BUT MAYBE NOT A BAILOUT BUT SHOULD BE FOCUS ON NOT DOING ANY HARM RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM HERE IS WE'RE NOT JUST KEEPING IT AT BAY WE HAVE PROPOSALS TO. IT TO INCREASE- RATES A ROOF AND REFORM THE RATE STRUCTURE FOR YOU SEE PROGRAMS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW FRANKLY KINDA HARD TO PUSH FOR DURING THIS COVER NINETEEN ERA. BUT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND THIS MAY REVISED PACKAGE IS ABSOLUTE HARM IT'S LIKE THE WORLD OF MEDICINE DO NO HARM AND SO THESE REALLY- DO HARM SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY. MINDFUL ABOUT THAT AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST WHAT'S MORALLYRIGHT BUT IF YOU WANT THE ECONOMY NOT TO CRATER YOU NEED TO HAVE- FINANCIALLY VIABLE CHILD CARE IN OUR IN OUR STATE. I THINK I HAVE. A QUESTION A COME BACK TO DAHLE TURNED OVER. TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MONNING GALLAGHER IN THE MEANTIME SOMEONE MEMBER LIMA. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE- WHAT ARE CHAIR HAS BROUGHT FORWARD I MEAN I CAN'T EXPRESS. HOW CRITICAL IT IS ADD THAT WE FOCUS ON PRESERVING THE CHILD CARE- INFRASTRUCTURE I KNOW THAT NOT JUST MY COLLEAGUES HERE BUT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS LONG LONG RECOGNIZED- IS THAT AT THIS FOR DECADES. THAT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS- ARE YOU CENTRAL AND THEY ARE PART OF RECOVERY I MEAN WE ARE CLEAR THAT CHILD CARE IN SCHOOL RE OPENING IS HOW OUR BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC SIDE OF THE YEAH. AND IF THEY COME TO ME IS GOING TO OPEN UP AND I AM I MEAN I'M TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL FOR ARM ARE AND AT S. R. OR- RATES I HAD TO BE CUT BY TEN PERCENT. I THINK THAT THAT IS A MAJOR MAJOR CONCERN WE ARE READING- I DON'T THINK THEY'RE KIND OF VETTED STUDIES YET BUT- KIND OF PROGNOSIS AN ANALYSIS THAT SOME OF THESE MAY NEVER COME. BACK IF WE LOSE SOME OF THESE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS THEY MAY NEVER COME BACK AND- THAT IS. UNBELIEVABLY CONCERNING AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE FOLKS TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AND I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS A SMALL WORKING GROUP ON THIS VERY ISSUE- BECAUSE WE SHARE THE CONCERNS- BUT EIGHT THINK FREE MEME. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I MEAN IT ASK QUESTIONS THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT A TYPICALLY ASK IN A BUDGET BUT WHAT VALUES GUIDED YOU TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WERE SEEN AND I KNOW I DON'T TYPICALLY ASK THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THEY GET DEEP DOWN BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PRESERVE AND WHAT VALUES ARE IMPORTANT TO US TO UNDER STAND. WHAT CAN FRONT OF US BECAUSE WHAT'S IN FRONT OF IT HURTS IT HURTS A LOT- AND- I GET THAT THE MONEY'S NOT THERE BUT I ALSO JUST THINK LIKE WE'RE NOT GETTING SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS BACK EVER. AT LEAST I AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT'S YOU KNOW PREDICTING A SO IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN TO US WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US. IN TERMS OF VALUES IN HOW YOU ALL CAME TO THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY FOR FINANCE NOT FOR ME. THE SCREEN BUT THE CAMERA I KNOW. SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO STATE THAT AS A VALUE AS A VALUE STATEMENT THESE ARE DIFFICULT DIFFICULT CUTS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION THIS IS ON SCENE DROPS. OUT THAT WE'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS ABOUT BALANCING THE BUDGET AND THE FISCAL HEALTH OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND EVERY PIECE OF OUR BUDGET PARTICIPATING IN MAKING SURE THAT WE REACH THIS BALANCE SO- I JUST WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT POINT. OKAY SO THEN WHAT PRINCIPLES WERE USED IN PANIC COMING TO THIS PROPOSAL. AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR THIS CT I MEAN WHAT I'M SENSING FROM YOU IS THAT IT'S EQUALLY HARD SO I'M JUST TRYING TO WHAT WAS THE GUIDING. PRINCIPLES IF IT'S NOT VALUES THAT KIND OF GOT IT HERE HOW DID WE THINK ABOUT THIS. IT WAS ABOUT EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THE REDUCTIONS SO YOU WILL SEE A 10% CUT IN ALL. STATE EMPLOYEES SALARIES IN ACROSS THE BOARD AND I'LL SEE IF F. IN ALL OF THE RELATED. THE 10% IS CONSISTENT AND IT. UNFORTUNATELY FAIRLY DISTRIBUTED SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU COULD SAY IT'S A PRINCIPLE OR VALUE IS ABOUT. TRYING TO BE EQUAL AND- AT THE VERY EIGHT. YEAH THAT THE I MEAN THAT'S FAIR AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO YOU KNOW UNDERSTAND OR I AM NOT YOU KNOW TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF. THIRTY RAY IT SOUNDS IKE IT'S PARITY AMONG ALL INSTITUTIONS. NOW I DON'T PERSONALLY THINK ALL INSTITUTIONS ARE THE SAME- I THINK THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES AND HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED- INDIFFERENTLY. CAN'T FIGURE IF I LIKE THE SMITHS OR NOT- IT DIFFERENT LEVELS ARE NOT BUT AND- I. YOU KNOW AND CHILD CARE JUST ONE THAT. IF I HAD TO THINK OF PARITY IN EQUITY I'M NOT SURE HAS EVER BEEN FOR YOU KNOW. FUNDED IN IN A WAY THAT'S NEEDED SO IT FEELS LIKE A 10% HURTS IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT I APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND. AND RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS ISN'T MEANT TO KIND OF HEY US AGAINST EACH OTHER IT'S JUST REALLY TO UNDERSTAND AND ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. WRAP OUR HEADS AROUND BEFORE WE VOTE ON A FINAL BUDGET- SO. WE HELD HARMLESS AT YOU KNOW FOR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL BASED CENTERS- SOME OF THE FUNDING. THROUGH THE END OF JUNE THIRTIETH WHAT HAPPENS AFTER. SO ONCE THE EXECUTIVE ORDER OF AND IT WOULD GO IT WOULD BE- A GO BACK TO THE NORMAL SO IF- BASED ON THE STUDENTS THAT PLACER. AND ARE THAT ONE TIME STIPENDS FOR SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE PROVIDERS INTENDED TO ACT AS HOLD HARMLESS. THEY'RE INTENDED TO HELP IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT FINANCIAL SITUATION SO YES THERE AND THEY'RE INTENDED TO HELP WITH ALL OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT WE KNOW THAT THESE PROVIDERS ARE HAVING RIGHT NOW SO LOOK SO HELP BUT NOT HOLD HARMLESS NECESSARILY. AND RAN ARE THE SEVENTY THREE MILLION FOR INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE FOR AT RISK CHILDREN- AND CHILDREN OF SEVENTY THREE S. OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS. TO BE USED FOR VOUCHERS IN ADDITION TO THE VOUCHERS PROVIDED THAT- FOR THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WERE RELEASED. YES THIS INTO THE FIFTY MILLION OKAY I NEED CAN BE AND THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING ON THOSE IS AVAILABLE TO SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE'RE HOPING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- HAVE THOSE SLOTS AVAILABLE DEPENDING ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS- WITH CO THAT NINETEEN. ON THAT THOSE UP SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR. ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND KIDS AT RISK DURING THIS TIME. OKAY WELL I JUST AND I APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS I THIS IS A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION I FEEL LIKE ALL OF OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT- IT AT AND LIKE I SAID I THINK THAT I KNOW THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS BEEN AT THIS A DEBT. DECK IT FOR DECADES AND SO IT'S IT JUST. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S WE'RE REALLY PASSIONATE ABOUT- AS OUR I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HERE- AND I A YOU KNOW I WANT TO ECHO WHAT'S BEEN SAID. BY THE CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN COME UP. IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION- FOR K. TWELVE IF WE CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN B. OR C. BUT- I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I THINK THAT. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS A LAWMAKER JUST AYE I CAN'T LOSE HOPE RIGHT NOW THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT. WE COULD KEEP SOME OF THESE PROVIDERS OPEN AND NOT LOSE THEM PERMANENTLY SO I THINK THAT ANY COMMENTS OR PASSION. THAT COMES OUT OF IT IS REALLY LOOKING AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR USAND- TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE THIS IS GONNA HURT EVERYONE. WE'RE JUST NOT BE SUMMIT WRITERS BE ABLE TO. READ AND IT'S GOING TO MAKE OUR STATES. UP PROBLEM HARDER AND- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED RELATED TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THE PREVIOUS. CONVERSATION WAS WHAT DO WE DEAL WITH ALL THESE KIDS. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH ALL THESE KIDS IF THEY'RE NOT IN CHILD CARE IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT- HAPPENS. OF BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED CHILDCARE. AND THEY'VE HAD TO MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT TYPES OF JOBS THEY TAKE WHETHER THEY CAN TAKE A JOB OR NOT- AND THAT CERTAINLY. HAS AN IMPACT TO OUR ECONOMY SO. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU GOOD QUESTIONS I HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP- FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS A MEMBER LIMóN BUT I WANT TO GET TO SOMEONE MEMBER GALLAGHER. YES SO I WANTED TO START BY LAYING OUT A FEW FUNDAMENTAL FAX. HE WAS AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT I HAVE BEEN A PROPONENT OF SAY FREE OPENING AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID IS WE DO NEED TO PART OF THAT IS RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND- ALL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE IS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S FRAMEWORK. SAY THAT SCHOOLS CAN RE OPEN IN THE FALL- NEO. MORE BOLD NEED DIFFERENT SAFETY PROTOCOLS THOSE ARE BEING WORKED ON- BUT THEY UNDER EVEN UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S FRAME WORK THEY CAN RE OPEN IN THE FALL SO THAT WILL DO A WHOLE LOT. HELPING ENSURE THAT KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL PARENTS CAN WORK OKAY. THE OTHER KEY COMPONENT THOUGH HERE IS CHILD CARE. AND CERTAINLY THAT'S THE OTHER BIG COMPONENT HERE THAT IN ORDER FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK- SAFELY REOPEN. WE NEED CHILDCARE. AND THIS IS AN AREA WHERE ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXTREMELY HELPFUL. AS I LIKE TO POINT OUT THE GOVERNOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALREADY PROVIDED TWO TRILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF RELIEF THAT IS GONNA BUSINESSES THAT HAS GONE TO CHILD CARE. TO HELP AND SUPPORT US AND THIS IS WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S STRATEGY AND ARGUMENT THIS DOES NOT LINE UP. BECAUSE IN FACT AND YOU GUYS ARE RELYING ON IT YOU'RE RELYING ON FEDERAL MONEY THAT HAS COME THROUGH HUNDRED FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR CODE NINETEEN EXPENSES INCLUDING TEMPORARY EMERGENCY VOUCHERS PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT CLEANING SUPPLIES AND SERVICES. AND SUSPENDING FAMILY FEES. HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR SUBSIDIZE FIRST PER STIPENDS TO ALL SUBSIDIZE. PROVIDERS AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION TO SUPPORT AN ESTIMATED FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM SLOTS. SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ACTUALLY ALREADY COME THROUGH TO HELP SUPPORT CHILD CARE AND YET AND THIS MAY REVISE YOUR PULLING BACK STATE MONEY. YOU'VE GOTTEN FEDERAL MONEY TO HELP SUPPORT THE SYSTEM THAT YOU ARE PULLING BACK STATE MONEY AND THEN YOU'RE SAYING WELL AND THOSE THOSE ARE GOING TO PLACE UNLESS THE FED'S GIVE US EVEN MORE MONEY. THE YOU KNOW THERE MIGHT BE AN ARGUMENT FOR OTHER PARTS OF THIS BUDGET SAYING HEY WE WANT TO RELY ON FEDERAL FUNDS AND IF THEY DON'T COME THROUGH. WE'RE GONNA TO MAKE BIGGER CUTS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. IN THE CHILDCARE SECTOR WHERE WE ARE GETTING. MONEY AND YET THE STATE IS PULLING BACK OR AT LEAST THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE HIS PROPONENT PROPOSING A PULL. BACK ON STATE COMMITMENTS. SHOULD BE THE OPPOSITE WE'VE GOTTEN FEDERAL FUNDS LET'S TRY TO KEEP AS MUCH OF THAT STATE FUNDING THERE IS OSSIBLE. SO I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE ANY RESPONSE THAT WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT IN THIS SITUATION. PULLING BACK STATE COMMITMENTS IN IF YOU'RE JUST DOING A 10% I GET THAT. YOU KNOW SOMETIME BUT THAT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO BUDGET. WHAT'S A PRIORITY. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TO DETERMINE GOING OUT TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS BECAUSE WE ARE IN SCARCE TIMES- AND THE MONEY IS NOT THERE FOR EVERYTHING. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY WE'RE GONNA CUT 10% ACROSS THE BOARD EVERYBODY. THAT'S AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION WE GOT A LOOK AT OKAY WELL WHAT ARE THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN PLACE. TO HELP PEOPLE THIS IS ONE OF THEM. SO I WE SHOULD JUST ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'VE ALREADY GOTTEN FEDERAL FUNDS AND YOU'RE RELYING ON THEM IN YOUR BUDGET. TO HELP KEEP THINGS STABLE WHY ARE YOU DOING A 10% CUT IF ANYTHING WE SHOULD TRY TO KEEP AS MUCH STATE FUNDS IN THERE AS POSSIBLE ANY RESPONSE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S ABOUT. BALANCING AND PROVIDING A FISCALLY STABLE AND BALANCED BUDGET. AND THOSE WERE. VERY VERY DIFFICULT IN OUR CHOICES AS I. AS I KNOW YOU. YOU RECOGNIZE THAT. YEAH BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST DID A SIMPLE 10% ACROSS THE BOARD CUT IN EACH YEAR. YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS TO US WHICH IS FINE HAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO THIS WORK- I DON'T KNOW THAT IT WAS A SIMPLE 10% CUT IF I MAY UM. IT WAS REALLY A MATTER OF MULTIPLE AND LAYERED CUTS BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WAS SO SEVERE THAT WE DID A LITTLE BIT AND WE HAD TO GO BACK AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH AND WE HAD TO DO SO. IT WAS A CONTINUAL AND A LONG PROCESS AND THESE CUTS ARE VERY VERY DIFFICULT THE ADMINISTRATION- IT THIS IS NOT EASY FOR ANYONE SET. UP NOW WHAT. ARE YOU IN THIS. ANOTHER NOT EASY DECISIONS FOR ANYBODY- BUT ID THERE WAS A REFERENCE EARLIER TO HEY WE TRIED TO MAKE IT EQUITABLE ACROSS THE BOARD WITH APARTMENTS. AND I KNOW THESE ARE EASY DECISIONS BUT THIS IS THIS ESPECIALLY ONE AREA WHERE YOU WOULD THINK. WE COULD FIND A WAY TO KEEP. THE MONEY IN THE SYSTEM IN A SPECIAL WE NEED WE'RE GONNA NEED THESE MORE THAN EVER- HAVING SUB TO THE AND YOU'RE CUTTING RATES AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO KEEP RATES STABLE. THAT NOBODY DISAGREES WITH. THE STATE HOME WATER AND THE NEED TO DO THAT. TO FLATTEN THE CURVE- BUT THE SIDE EFFECT OF THAT HAS BEEN. THAT MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY CRIPPLED AND CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE ARE ARE NO DIFFERENT THEY HAD TO THEY HAD TO OPERATE UNDER VERY LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES OF FOR A WHILE COULD ONLY PROVIDE TO A SENSUAL- WORKERS- SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE NUMBERS. TO MAKE A PROFITABLE VIABLE BUSINESS- AND THEN THEY HAVE ALL THESE OTHER CONSTRAINTS BEING PUT UPON THEM SO ALL YOUR YOUR INCREASING THEIR COSTS AND CUTTING THEIR REVENUE. AND NOW WE'RE SAYING OKAY BUT OPEN BACK UP AGAIN AND PROVIDE THIS SERVICE- BUT WE'RE GONNA CUT THE OF THIS. THE RATES THAT WE PAY YOU. AND THAT MAKES NO SENSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE PLANNING KEEP. AND THAT AND I'M OTHER BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY IMPACTED THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO REOPEN SAFELY. AND REALLY BEGIN THAT PROCESS AND DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS ACTUALLY VIABLE. FOR BUSINESSES TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE CHILD CARE BEING THE ONE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RIGHT NOW LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION I MEAN LA- HAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAYBE MAKE REDUCTIONS BASED ON A PERCENTILE OF THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE WHICH- MIGHT BE A FAIR WAY TO ENSURE EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PRIVATE MARKET- ACROSS THE STATE IS THAT. SOMETHING YOU GUYS OF LOOK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE ANY COMMENT ON THAT. IT IS NOT PART OF OUR PROPOSAL THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY. SESSIONS WITH THE LA. WELL LOOK I JUST I THINK MY POINT IS IT I THINK THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE CAN KEEP STATE MONEY INTO THIS PROGRAM WE ALREADY HAVE FEDERAL MONEY WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE NO CONTROL AS YOU SAID BEFORE WE HAVE NO CONTROL OF A WHAT- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENDS UP DOING WITHIN. WITH ADDITIONAL STIMULUS OVER AND ABOVE THE TWO TRILLION IT'S ALREADY BEEN GIVEN. WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF CONTROL OVER THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL HOPEFUL THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING COMING IN. BUT HERE'S INNER WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN FUNDING SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP STATE FUNDING AS STABLE AS POSSIBLE. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY BE A PROPONENT OF THAT AND THE LAST THING I THINK WE NEED TO DO ESPECIALLY THE CHILD CARE SECTOR RIGHT NOW. IS BE CUTTING RATES. ARBITRARILY ACROSS THE BOARD. AT THE VERY LEAST MAYBE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS ON THE ON THE REGIONAL BASIS. AND A AND HOPEFULLY WE WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT. AT ALL SO THAT'S A- THOSE ARE MY TWO CENTS. BUT. OKAY THANK YOU A MISTER GALLAGHER THOSE ARE. THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS GREAT COMMENTARY THAT TO SHOW THAT THIS IS A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND- AND I APPRECIATE YOU IF YOU ENGAGE IN HERE JUST A COUPLE FOLLOW UP- PIECES FROM THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK TOMORROW ABOUT UC AND CSU AND- I CONCUR THAT THERE'S PAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUDGET. BUT THAT 10% IS AN APPLES TO APPLES AND AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN SAID IN SOME AREAS AS A BIGGER CONSEQUENCE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT IT UC AND CSU LAST YEAR WE HAD BIG AUDITS ON THEM THAT THEY HAD THESE. RESERVE ACCOUNTS AND- SO CALLED SLUSH FUNDS AND SO THE CUTS FOR THOSE- UC AND CSU ARE ROUGHLY BETWEEN THREE AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. MAYBE THEY CAN WEATHER THE STORM FOR A YEAR OR TWO- THEY CERTAINLY SOMETIMES OF THE UC ESPECIALLY HAVE PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY THAT COULD COME IN AND FILL THE GAP. THEY COULD YOU KNOW DO PAINFUL STUFF LIKE INCREASE STUDENT FEES THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO BALANCE IT OUT THEY CAN ROLL MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT UC. BUT WITH THESE CUTS IN FRANKLY CHILD CARE IT'S NOT JUST 10% IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE SELECT THE IT'S A REAL CONSEQUENCES SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT. WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO JUST TAKE IT AS IT IS IT- IT'S 10% ACROSS THE BOARD BANG FOR STATE WORKERS AND UC AND CSU AND- HEALTHIER FACT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALL THE SAME THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT. VARIABLES WHICH WE REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT IN MIND BEFORE WE ADOPT OUR FINAL BUDGET SO- THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO. I DO REALIZE THAT WE'RE MAKING. VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS HERE WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET BUT FOR EXAMPLE THE PRE SCHOOL EXPANSION YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN ADVOCATE OF. PRESCHOOL FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR'S TALKED ABOUT UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND WE'RE PUTTING THAT EXPANSION ON HOLD AND SO. I CONCUR WE CAN'T NECESSARILY FOR THAT RIGHT NOW WE HAD- NOT JUST PRESCHOOL BUT FULL DAY PRESCHOOL LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SLOTS INCREASED- WHICH ESSENTIALLY AS CHILD CARE BECAUSE IT'S A FULL DAY- GRAND NOT THE SAME DAY- SOMETIMES AS THE CHILD CARE CENTERS. NONE THE LESS THOUGH IT SERVES FAMILIES WHEN THEY GO TO WORK- WERE PULLING BACK ON THAT EXPANSION AND I THINK THAT'S A SMART THING TO DO- BUT THOSE ARE AN EXISTING KIDS BEING SERVED- THERE'S BEEN SOME IN NEW FAMILIES AND SO. AGAIN TO CARE THAT HOUSE OP. TO REALLY UPSET THE APPLE CART UPSET THE APPLE CART OF THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES CURRENTLY BEING SERVED- SO WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL ABOUT THAT. WERE USING THE MONIES THAT WE HAD FOR THE PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES WERE SWEEPING HOUSAND PUTTING THOSE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET TO WHICH I THINK IT'S SMART TO- SO. AGAIN THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WERE KINDA GIVING ON BUT THIS ONE I THINK WE NEED TAKE A SECOND LOOK. I DO HAVE ANOTHER. QUESTION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN THE LA OKAY. ON THE FEDERAL MONIES- MISTER GALLAGHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT THE FIRST. BIT OF MONEY IN THERE SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT WE SHOULDN'T TAKE A MAJOR HIT RIGHT HERE WE SHOULD. FRANKLY LOOK ABOUT POTENTIALLY GROWING WE DO. HAVE THE MONEY'S IN THERE FOR SERVING MORE IN THE SENSE A WORKER- AT THE SUCH A WORKER- CATEGORY- IF THERE IS AN- ADDITIONAL WAVE A FEDERAL MONEY- WOULD THERE BE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ACCESS TO NOT. FOCUS ON JUST. YOU KNOW KEEPING EVEN BUT INCREASE ACCESS. RATHER FOR SLOTS FOR RATES. YEAH GOING TO TAKE THE QUESTION- I THINK PART OF THE- DETERMINATION WILL BE- WHAT KIND OF FUNDING THAT PROGRAM AND PROVIDE THEM WITH STRINGS ATTACHED TO THEM SO FOR EXAMPLE THE- THE CARE THAT. ARE HAD A DVD AUGMENTATION WHICH IS THE AUGMENTATION OF THINK WOULD IN THE MAYOR VISION DOES WALL ONE TIME AUGMENTATION BUT THEY WERE ARE RELATED TO THE OUTBREAK- THAT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO PAY FOR EXAMPLE. INCREASE ACTIVE BECAUSE YOU'RE USING ONE TIME FUNDING- BUT TO DEFER BUT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS ABLE TO PROVIDE A- MORE FLEXIBLE FUNDING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT. BUT DEFINITELY. COULD BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. OKAY. I THINK- I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. SO THIS AGAIN WAS. WE DID TALK ABOUT HE SAYS AGAIN RIGHT YEAH WE'RE GOOD WITH THAT. SO THE LA I JUST WANT TO CONCUR THAT THAT YOU DID RECOMMEND THAT WE DON'T DO THAT. CHEF FOR CHILD CARE TO DSS. YES THAT'S CORRECT YEAH WE ARE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND REJECTING A PROPOSAL- AND WE HAD A WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS IN IN IN OUR OUR ORIGINAL HOUSE IS JUST ABOUT- YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE SPLITTING DID GENERAL TUCKER AT THE PRESCHOOL- AND ALSO JUST- THE RATIONALE FOR WHY THE CHANGE WE NEED TO OCCUR. WHEN WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONCERNS- AND WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL HAS BEEN MODIFIED BUT THE ONGOING COSTS OF THE RIPPLES ARE STILL UNCLEAR OKAY- HERE MY FINAL TWO ISSUES THAT I FOUND MY NOTES HERE- THIS I WAS GONNA ASK CD INSERT NOVEL MORGAN. WHAT WHAT WERE YEAR WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT THE LAST TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LA- AND I GUESS IT'S PAGE TEN. THE READER ACT UP PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS FROM EXPANSION TO RATE STABILIZATION. AND THEN. THIS IN KAMALA. THING. SHARES THEY WERE I JUST RECEIVED A PROPOSAL WHILE WE WERE IN THE HEARING SO I HAVEN'T HAD TIME WITH MY TEAM TO REALLY DIVE INTO IT BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE BOTH WITHOUT LEO THAT LEGISLATURE ANYA ADMINISTRATION TO DROP IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACHIEVE A REDUCTION ACROSS EARLY LEARNING CARE BEYOND THE ANY OTHER OPPORTUNITY INCLUDING THERE'S THE FIFTY THREE MILLION THAT CAME AND AN ADDITIONAL CCF FINDS HOW COULD THAT BE USED FOR THE RATES THIS YEAR INSTEAD OF FURTHER EXPANSION. AND WE ALWAYS OF COURSE WANT TO SUPPORT EXPANSION WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT NEED ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED EARLY LEARNING AND CARE BUT WE'RE REALLY WORRIED RIGHT NOW THAT ACCESS ACTUALLY ISN'T ACCOUNTABLE WHEN YOU'RE CUTTING THE RATES AS DRASTICALLY AS WE WOULD BE CUTTING THEM. OKAY AND THEN. LASTLY THIS IS BACK TO LA- SO THERE IS SOME CONFUSION WHEN WE- WHEN WE LEFT HERE IN MARCH WE HAD AN EMERGENCY LEGISLATION WE HAVE THAT FIFTY MILLION FOR- YOU KNOW. CLEANING AND PP AND ALL THAT AND YOU KNOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND SO. THAT MONEY IS SHIFTING FROM THAT. FROM THE BUT FROM THE CURRENT YEAR TO THE BUDGET YEAR. RIGHT. YEAH I THINK WE'RE A RESURFACING THAT ESSENTIALLY WE'RE NOT LOSING IT RIGHT. IF SO I THINK- BUT THE COMMENTS WE MADE SO THERE TO PUT THE FUNDING THAT WAS THAT WERE PROVIDED- THE THESE WERE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD. THE EMERGENCY AUTHORITY TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PREPARATIONS YEAH- BUT- AND SO THERE WERE TO CHALKER RELATED- PROPOSALS OR AUGMENTATIONS ONE WITH FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS FOUR PP THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE OPEN- THAT THE OTHER WAS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EMERGENCY DOCTORS FOR SENT TO WORKERS. I'M WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC OUR OFFICIAL NUMBERS YET BUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM A FEW- FOLKS THAT THAT THEY THINK A LOT OF THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED HAVE NOT GONE USED- NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW I BELIEVE- I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT THE THIRD OF THE ALLOWABLE MOVIE FOR BUT WE WITH. BIG ONE IMPORTANT THING IN IN ADOPTING THE BUDGET IS TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF HOW MUCH OUT FUNDING REMAINS AVAILABLE THAT WE COULD EXPECT THAT COULD BE PROVIDED IN THE BUDGET YEAR FOR. THEM TO WORKERS IN IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEN- WITH THE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE- MUCH OR ANY OF THAT- ADDITIONAL AUGMENT WHAT TIME AUGMENTATION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAPPENED A PURPOSE. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFICALLY WAS RATHER THAN PROVIDING THE ADDITIONAL HUNDRED FEET OR THE ADDITIONAL ONE TIME DOCTORS IS TO USE THE PERSPECTIVE. I GUESS THAT'S THE POINT IS WE MAY NOT KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR A FEW WEEKS AND WE'RE TRYING TO WRAP UP OUR STATE BUDGET PROCESS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. RECONCILE THOSE TWO APPROPRIATIONS SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD IN BACK- WE HAVE THIS MONEY FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET WHEN WE POTENTIALLY COULD BE MAKING DEVASTATING. ACTIONS NOW SO I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALL THAT INFORMATION BEFORE. US AS WE GO FORWARD. THIS DONNELLY OF THE QUESTIONS THIS ITEM NOW OKAY- SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ON ON- THIS THAT CHILD CARE. SCHOOL SECTION OF THE MAY REVISE AGAIN THIS IS AN INFORMATION LINE AND THERE ARE NO VOTES TODAY. WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT. KAY AND TO HAVE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM.
