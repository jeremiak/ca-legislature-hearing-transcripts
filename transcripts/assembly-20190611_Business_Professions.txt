REGULARLY SCHEDULED BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE HEARING. FOR TUESDAY JUNE ELEVENTH THE CHAIR NOTICES THE PRESENCE OF OF FELLOW REPUBLICAN MEMBER BUT NOTICES THE ABSENCE OF A QUORUM TO BE ACTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE FOR THE TIME BEING. SO WITH THAT SAID WE WILL BEGIN IN FIVE ORDER WITH FILE ITEM NUMBER ONE WHICH IS SB THIRTY BOOKS THIRTY FOUR BY SENATOR SCOTT WIENER. AND AS SENATOR WIENER FOR INDIVIDUALS IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTALITY AGAIN UP TO THREE MINUTES FOR TEST MONEY FOR A SUPPORTERS. IN ADDITION TO YOURSELF SO PLEASE FEEL FREE PERCENT WHENEVER YOU'RE READY -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU DEAR AND STUFF -- FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL -- AS WE HAVE A RETURN TRIP -- AFTER THE UNFORTUNATE VETO -- BY -- GOVERNOR BROWN BUT WE'RE DETERMINED TO GET IT DONE THIS YEAR -- BECAUSE THIS IS THE THE DENNIS PERON A BROWNIE MARY -- ACT -- TO ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME PEOPLE CAN CONTINUE -- TO ACCESS MEDICAL CANNABIS -- VIA DONATION -- FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW DENNIS PERON A BROWNIE MARY WERE TWO OF THE CALENDARS I DECADES AGO OF THE MEDICAL CANNABIS -- MOVEMENT DURING A TIME IN SAN FRANCISCO -- WHEN -- MANY MANY PEOPLE WERE GETTING VERY VERY SICK AND DYING. OF HIV -- AIDS AND MEDICAL CANNABIS HELP THEM TO LIVE LONGER AND TO BE MORE COMFORTABLE -- IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DENNIS PERON A BROWNIE MARY -- WERE KEY -- TO GIVING PEOPLE -- ACCESS IS NO CANNABIS AND ALSO TO LEGALIZING MEDICAL CANNABIS WHICH SERVE VOTERS DID IN THE LATE NINETEEN NINETIES -- AND THERE'S DONATED MEDICAL CANNABIS FOR LOW INCOME PATIENTS HAS BEEN A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PART -- OF CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE WHETHER LIVING WITH HIV OR WITH CANCER. ARE VETERANS WITH PTSD -- DON'T HAVE -- TO USE THEIR FOOD MONEY -- TO PURCHASE OUR MEDICINE AND CAN GET THAT ACCESS. AND THESE COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAMS ON OUR CLOSING UP NOW BECAUSE WHEN THE VOTERS -- LEGALIZED SO DON'T USE OF CANNABIS -- DAY WE BELIEVE IN INVER AND LAID OUT -- BALLOT MEASURE IMPOSED FULL TAXES ON THESE COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE NO REVENUE -- SO OF COURSE THEY CAN'T PAY TAXES OF THEIR THEIR FOR CLOSING DOWN. AND LOW INCOME -- PATIENTS OR LOSING ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICAL CANNABIS -- SO THIS BILL -- WILL SIMPLY -- ELIMINATE TAXES ON THESE -- DONATED -- DONATION PROGRAMS -- AND THE PRESIDENT HER PROGRAMS WILL HAVE TO PARTNER WITH A LICENSED -- CANNABIS BUSINESS SO THE REVOLVER GUARDRAILS AROUND IT -- AND WE'RE STRICTLY US FOR AYE VOTE I DO WANNA NOTES -- THAT THE POLICE CHIEFS -- AND I THEIR LOBBYISTS ARE AUTHORIZED THIS IS THE POLICE CHIEFS HAVE OR WITHDRAWING THEIR OPPOSITION -- TO THE BILL -- AND SO -- THAT LETTER IT HAS NOT COME IN YET BUT WE'RE TOLD TO MAKE COME IN TODAY -- BUT THEY DID AUTHORIZED ME TO REPORT THAT TO YOU -- WITH ME HERE IT'S TESTIFIED -- IS AMY JENKINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND SHAUN CURE IN AN WITH WEED FOR WARRIORS A VETERAN BASED -- COMPASSION PROGRAM THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE CAN UP TO THREE MINUTES IN TOTAL. I'LL MAKE IT QUICK -- REAL QUICK SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DISABLED VETERANS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MAKE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE VA. IF THERE ARE ABLE THEY CAN MAKE IT A THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM SSI SO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO MEDICATE JUST ON A VERY BARNEY LEVEL WILL SAYS MY MARINE FRIENDS WILL SAY. YOU NEED AN EIGHT THE FLOWER DAY THAT'S BASICALLY FOR JOINTS A LOT OF PEOPLE'S USE HEALTHIER MEANS OF ABSORPTION BUT WE'LL JUST KEEP IT SIMPLE. AVERAGE EIGHT THIS FORTY DOLLARS AFTER WE APPLY THAT VERY LOW TAX RATE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN ROUND DOWN. TO FIFTY FIFTY TIMES THIRTY IS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF THEY BY IN THE DISPENSARY WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST A VETERAN. TO MEDICATE PROPERLY AS AN ALTERNATIVE. TWO BIG PHARMA. SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT IT'S JUST NOT PRAGMATIC FOR DISABLED VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA TO MEDICATE AND SO THAT'S WHERE. SB THIRTY FOUR THESE COMPASSION PROGRAMS COME IN ALL THESE VETERANS BACK HERE THEY DO USE DISPENSARIES BUT THEY CAN'T MEDICARE FOR THE WHOLE MONTH SO THAT'S WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE OURSELVES. IN OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE OPERATION NEED BACK IN OTHER PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE -- TO GET TOGETHER WITH YOU FOR WE USED TO GIVE FREE METS TO OUR VETERANS% TO COMPENSATE FOR THAT THAT ENABLE THEM TO GET OFF THE FORMA WHICH INCLUDES OVERDOSE ADDICTION AND SUICIDAL INCLINATIONS AT FTA STATED. RISK CANNABIS DOESN'T HAVE THAT RISK AND NOW WE'RE SEEING CORRELATION STUDIES IN STATES WHERE IT'S BEEN LEGALIZED WE CHAU OVERDOSE IS DOWN IN SUICIDES ARE DOWN. AND SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE IS GIVEN OUR VETERANS A PATHWAY. TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE PHARMACEUTICAL DEBT THAT WERE SEEN AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ME SAID SB THIRTY FOUR IS NOT GOING TO CURE ALL IT'S ONLY AN ON RAMP. TO THE LEGAL COMMUNITY AND RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO FIX THAT LEGAL COMMUNITY SO HELP US GET THAT ON RAMP AND THEN LET US HELP EVERYONE. GET THE SYSTEM TO WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE TO SERVE THE VETERAN COP WITH POPULATION.
