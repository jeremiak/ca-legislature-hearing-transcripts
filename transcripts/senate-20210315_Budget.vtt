00:15:30.996 --> 00:15:32.631
APPRECIATE IT I'M SORRY I

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:36.168
MISSED IT- YES- I BELIEVE THAT

00:15:36.235 --> 00:15:40.039
SECTION- TO FORTY EIGHT. POINT

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:43.108
TWO LITTLE E. PARAGRAPH TWO

00:15:43.175 --> 00:15:48.314
SUBPARAGRAPH C. OKAY AS I LOOK

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.215
FOR THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.685
ANOTHER QUESTION- WILL THAT

00:15:52.751 --> 00:15:54.953
ALSO COVERS THE INACCURATE WAIT%

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:56.689
STATEMENT FOR THE EMPLOYEE WAS

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.357
NOT AND PAID THE CORRECT WAGES

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.259
ON THEIR WEIGHT STATEMENT WHICH

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.560
CREATES IF A CIVIL PENALTY IN

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:04.430
A- IN A PENALTY FOR- WAGES AS

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:06.098
WELL FOR NOT HAVING AN ACCURATE

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:06.965
WAGE STATEMENTS ISSUED TO THOSE

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:09.268
EMPLOYEES. AND UNDER CURRENT

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.003
LAW AN EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE TO

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.838
RETROACTIVELY OBJECT EVERY PAGE

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:14.606
EVERY WAIT STATEMENT TO EVERY

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.875
EMPLOYEE AND RE MAIL THEM A

00:16:16.942 --> 00:16:19.778
COPY OF AN ADJUSTED PAYSTUB

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:21.814
WITH THE CORRECT INFORMATION

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.716
SHOWING THE TWO WEEKS PAID. AND

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:24.616
THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAIL

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.018
THAT WITHIN A THIRTY DAY PERIOD

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:28.320
DOES THAT STILL APPLY UNDER

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:31.123
THIS. SO I BELIEVE THERE'S A

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.092
PROVISION IN THERE THAT ALLOW

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.894
SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE-

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.097
THOSE PAY STATEMENTS- FOR

00:16:38.163 --> 00:16:39.965
EMPLOYERS I DON'T HAVE THE

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:42.468
CITATION ON HAND- BUT DEUCE BUT

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.937
DO NOTE THAT- THAT THERE IS A

00:16:45.003 --> 00:16:45.804
PROVISION IN THERE THAT

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:46.905
PROFILES PROVIDE SOME

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.941
FLEXIBILITY FOR EMPLOYERS TO

00:16:49.007 --> 00:16:51.176
ADDRESS THOSE PAY STATEMENTS.

00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.978
OKAY M. JUST ANOTHER QUESTION

SIXTEEN PAGES I'M TRYING TO GO

AND WE'LL GET SOME OTHER

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.579
QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS HAVE I

00:17:27.646 --> 00:17:29.815
HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION OKAY AND

00:17:29.882 --> 00:17:30.682
WHAT IF THAT'S POSSIBLE IT'S

00:17:30.749 --> 00:17:32.050
NOT RELATED TO THAT SPECIFIC

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.986
WORDING. IN THE PREVIOUS BILL

00:17:34.052 --> 00:17:35.220
AND THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:37.556
BILL M. IN A PREVIOUS VERSION

00:17:37.623 --> 00:17:39.124
OF THE BILL IT WAS EIGHTY HOURS

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:43.529
PER CALENDAR YEAR AND THIS IS

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:45.030
EIGHTY HOURS- BUT IT DOESN'T

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:48.066
SAY. IT'S NOT IS IT IT IN THE

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:49.034
PREVIOUS VERSION IT WAS

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:50.769
DEFINITELY IDENTIFIED THAT YOU

00:17:50.836 --> 00:17:52.204
COULD ONLY USE THE EIGHTY HOURS

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:54.173
OF SICKLY FOR COVERT IN A ONE

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.875
TIME- IN ONE TIME LIKE FOURTEEN

00:17:56.942 --> 00:17:58.610
DAYS WITH A TICKET FOR DAYS

00:17:58.677 --> 00:17:59.578
THREE DAYS TWO DAYS WHATEVER TO

00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:01.313
TAKE CAE OF A FAMILY MEMBER.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:03.549
IT WAS A TOTAL OF FOURTEEN DAYS

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:05.551
OR EIGHTY HOURS. THIS BILL

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.753
DOESN'T MAKE IT A TOTAL OF

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:09.221
EIGHTY HOURS IN THE LANGUAGE

00:18:09.288 --> 00:18:10.322
AND I REALIZE IT'S OVER IN

00:18:10.389 --> 00:18:11.723
SEPTEMBER BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE A

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:13.559
TOTAL HOURS. IN THE LANGUAGE SO

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:14.927
I DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:16.728
IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT AND

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:17.529
THEN GO BACK TO MY PREVIOUS

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.631
QUESTION- ON WHERE IT'S AT THE

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:21.133
LANGUAGE TO ADDRESS THE

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.202
RETROACTIVITY AND THAT THE

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:24.203
PENALIZING OF EMPLOYERS I'D

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:25.838
REALLY APPRECIATE IT. YEAH

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.272
CHRIS COOK WITH FINANCE AGAIN

00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:28.474
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:30.008
DOES PROVIDE UP TO EIGHTY

00:18:30.075 --> 00:18:32.311
HOURS- I DON'T THINK I

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:33.745
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION ABOUT

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:37.449
IT NOT BEING- NOT ALLOWING FOR

00:18:37.516 --> 00:18:40.586
EIGHTY HOURS. SO IT IT IT IT

00:18:40.652 --> 00:18:42.888
SHOULD ALLOW FOR UP TO EIGHTY

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:43.455
HOURS THAT SUPPLEMENTAL PAID

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:46.191
SICK LEAVE. SO IT'S NOT UP TO

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:47.326
EIGHTY HOURS AND THAT WAS MY

00:18:47.392 --> 00:18:48.727
QUESTION I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:51.463
BEING AND MORE EXPLICIT- AND-

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.998
IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:55.567
BILL. IT SAID IT WAS A- EIGHTY

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:58.403
HOURS MAXIMUM BASICALLY DIDN'T

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.037
USE THE WORD MAXIMUM I CAN PULL

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:02.441
IT OUT. OF EIGHTY HOURS IN A

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:04.343
CALENDAR YEAR THERE'S A

00:19:04.409 --> 00:19:06.445
PREVIOUS VERSION. THIS IS

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.980
EIGHTY HOURS BUT IT DOESN'T SAY

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:10.148
MAXIMUM SO MY QUESTION IS WILL

00:19:10.215 --> 00:19:12.784
DEPLOY YEARS. AND BE REQUIRED

00:19:12.851 --> 00:19:14.853
TO PAY EIGHTY HOURS AND THEN

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.722
THIRTY DAYS LATER PAID. AND

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:17.990
ANOTHER TWO WEEKS OR TWO MONTHS

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:19.358
LATER BECAUSE THERE'S ANOTHER

00:19:19.424 --> 00:19:20.259
FAMILY MEMBER THAT'S ILL PAY

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:21.793
ANOTHER TWO WEEKS. BECAUSE

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.161
THERE'S NO MAXIMUM IN THIS

00:19:23.228 --> 00:19:24.162
VERSION OF THE BILL THAT I CAN

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:27.432
FIND AND AGAIN I JUST GOT THE

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:28.634
LANGUAGE I THINK IT WAS. LATE

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.869
SUNDAY NIGHT LAST NIGHT SO-

00:19:30.936 --> 00:19:32.337
BECAUSE IT I THINK IT WENT IN

00:19:32.404 --> 00:19:34.940
FRIDAY AND WAS AMENDED ON

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.975
SATURDAY AND I GOT IT SUNDAY-

00:19:37.042 --> 00:19:38.176
SO I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:39.611
COMPLETELY DIGEST EACH LABOR

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:41.113
CODE BUT IF YOU WOULD JUST

00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:41.813
POINT THAT OUT TO ME SO I CAN

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.615
BE SURE. THAT EMPLOYERS ARE NOT

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.517
GOING TO BE. REQUIRED TO PAY

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:47.553
MULTIPLE FOURTEEN DAY PERIODS

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.488
OR MULTIPLE TIME FRAMES. AND

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:51.056
THEN ALSO THE RETROACTIVITY

00:19:51.123 --> 00:19:52.357
ISSUE THAT I ADDRESSED EARLIER

00:19:52.424 --> 00:19:54.259
TELL ME THE CODE SECTION. AND I

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:55.928
REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:58.363
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SCENE-

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:00.666
IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. BUT IN

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.501
THE REAL WORLD EMPLOYERS IN THE

00:20:02.568 --> 00:20:04.069
STATE CAN'T OPERATE ON YOUR

00:20:04.136 --> 00:20:05.237
UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE TO

00:20:05.304 --> 00:20:06.972
OPERATE ON THE EXACT LANGUAGE.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.307
THAT IS IN THIS BILL AND I'D

00:20:08.373 --> 00:20:09.141
APPRECIATE IT IF YOU COULD

00:20:09.207 --> 00:20:12.711
JUST- COVER THE SUBJECT MATTERS

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:15.581

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.151
DOES NOT PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL

00:20:19.217 --> 00:20:20.285
EIGHTY HOURS IT'S ONLY EIGHTY

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:23.055
HOURS A SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK

00:20:23.121 --> 00:20:24.790
LEAVE FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. SO

00:20:24.856 --> 00:20:26.725
FROM JANUARY TO SEPTEMBER

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:30.295
EIGHTY HOURS TOTAL. AGAIN CAN

00:20:30.362 --> 00:20:31.697

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:32.798
THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT WAS IN

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.466
THE PREVIOUS VERSION BUT I

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:37.769
CAN'T FIND IT IN THIS VERSION.

00:20:37.836 --> 00:20:40.172
I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.340
REFERENCE I HAVE TO GO BACK AND

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:43.375

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:51.984
IS REFERENCING. OKAY THANK YOU.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.251
IF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

REFINES THE CODE SECTION WE CAN

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:57.155

LIKE A COMMENT ON THE QUESTION-

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:08.834
OBVIOUSLY IT WON'T APPLY THE

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.936
ACTION FOR. THE NUMBER OF

00:21:11.003 --> 00:21:12.537
WORKERS WHO ARE GOING TO BE

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:15.240
COVERED I THINK THE ABILITY TO

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:18.477
BE ABLE TO. BE PART OF SOLVING

00:21:18.543 --> 00:21:21.213
AND STOPPING THE SPREAD OF KOBE

00:21:21.279 --> 00:21:24.549
NINETEEN- IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.418
TO ALL OF US AND HAVING THE

00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:28.053
ABILITY TO TAKE THE TIME AND

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.287
NOT WORRY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

00:21:29.354 --> 00:21:32.057
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE PAY. IS PART

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:34.559
OF THE DECISION THAT A WORKING

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:37.462
PERSON MAKES ARE TO TAKE THE

00:21:37.529 --> 00:21:38.930
TIME OFF TO TAKE CARE OF

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:40.799
THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:42.167
THAT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US AND

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:44.970
SO I THINK IT'S- REALLY GOOD

00:21:45.037 --> 00:21:47.606
THAT WE'RE TAKING THAT ONE-

00:21:47.673 --> 00:21:53.211
ACTION. HOWEVER I. LARGE

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.547
EXEMPTION OF THE NUMBER OF

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:57.883
EMPLOYERS WHO WILL HAVE WHICH

I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW

00:22:04.256 --> 00:22:05.457
THAT'S UP TO FOUR MILLION

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:06.892
WORKERS THAT WOULD BE EXEMPT

00:22:06.958 --> 00:22:08.827
FROM THE PAID SICK LEAVE UNDER

00:22:08.894 --> 00:22:11.530

00:22:13.865 --> 00:22:15.033
LOT OF ASSISTANCE AND I'VE

CLOSED. IT IS OBVIOUSLY TOUGH

00:24:40.545 --> 00:24:42.581
ECONOMIC TIMES BUT ON THE OTHER

00:24:42.647 --> 00:24:44.716
HAND THERE ARE ALSO MANY MANY

00:24:44.783 --> 00:24:46.384
WORKERS THAT ARE BARELY GETTING

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.386

WHETHER ON THE JOB OR ELSEWHERE-

WE HAVE ISSUES OF ECONOMIC

00:25:02.701 --> 00:25:04.502
FAIRNESS AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:25:04.569 --> 00:25:06.504
SENATOR ALSO POINTED OUT. MANY

00:25:06.571 --> 00:25:07.939
OF THESE WORKERS ARE LOW WAGE

00:25:08.006 --> 00:25:10.175
THERE PEOPLE OF COLOR- THIS IS

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:11.142
ALSO ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH WE

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:12.644
DON'T WANT PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK

00:25:12.711 --> 00:25:14.212
WITH COVERT COMING INTO WORK-

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:15.413
SO I KNOW A LOT OF HARD WORK

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:17.949
WENT INTO THIS. I GUESS MY

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:20.085
FIRST QUESTION IS JUST- YOU

00:25:20.151 --> 00:25:23.421
KNOW I. AM I THINK HAPPY WITH

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.490
THE OUTCOME I BELIEVE THAT WITH

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:27.292
THE- DIFFERENT. ACTIONS THAT

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.927
THE STATE LEGISLATURES TAKEN

00:25:28.994 --> 00:25:29.861
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:31.830
TAKING. THESE BUSINESSES ARE

00:25:31.897 --> 00:25:33.632
GETTING A LOT OF RELIEF- TO

00:25:33.698 --> 00:25:34.933
HELP COVER. SOME OF THE

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.768
RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS BUT- I'D

00:25:36.835 --> 00:25:38.503
BE CURIOUS IF- DEPARTMENT OF

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:40.472
FINANCE MIGHT ELABORATE- TO

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:42.507
WHAT DEGREE WILL THIS ALL BE

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:44.776
COVERED UNDER FEDERAL AND

00:25:44.843 --> 00:25:48.947
STATE. PROGRAMS AND FUNDING.

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.249
THE PURPOSE I NEED TO GO AHEAD

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:53.118
I THINK YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN THE-

00:25:53.184 --> 00:25:54.719
FACT THAT THESE TAX CREDITS

00:25:54.786 --> 00:25:56.354
BASICALLY COVER THE EMPLOYERS

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.890
COSTS BUT GO AHEAD. YES

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:00.959
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU TERRY-

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:02.994
SENTIMENT YES THE SMALL

00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:05.330
BUSINESSES- IF THEY SO CHOOSE

00:26:05.397 --> 00:26:06.665
TO PROVIDED BELOW TWENTY FIVE

00:26:06.731 --> 00:26:08.533
IN OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THE SMALL

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.001
BUSINESSES OVER THAT. THEY DO

00:26:10.068 --> 00:26:11.503
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:13.171
THIS AND GET A PRETTY GENEROUS

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:14.906
CREDIT- FROM THE FEDERAL

00:26:14.973 --> 00:26:15.840
GOVERNMENT WHICH IS A ONE TO

00:26:15.907 --> 00:26:19.177
ONE- SO. THAT FEDERAL LAW DOES

00:26:19.244 --> 00:26:20.879
COMPENSATE THEM FOR THIS LEAVE

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.781
THAT IS TAKEN AND ONE OTHER

00:26:22.847 --> 00:26:23.949
THING THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO

00:26:24.015 --> 00:26:25.517
ADD IS. IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

00:26:25.583 --> 00:26:28.219
THAT MANY LOW LOCALS ARE ALSO

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.889
PROVIDING OUR HAVE EXTENDED THE

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.858
BASICALLY THAT WAS- ENACTED

00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:35.927
EARLIER THIS YEAR UNDER AB

00:26:35.994 --> 00:26:38.129
EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN- I BELIEVE

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:40.899
L. A. SAN JOSE OAKLAND- TO NAME

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:43.535
A FEW- THIS THIS LEGISLATION

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:45.270
REALLY PROVIDES- SENT

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:49.941
STATEWIDE- GARDENS AND- CLARITY.

00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.476
THIS IS THE SHOULD BE APPLIED

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.611
UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE STATE SO-

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:55.680
AGAIN MANY LOCALS HAVE ALREADY

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.248
TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:59.117
PROVIDE THE SICKLY EVEN THIS IS

00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:00.352
JUST PROVIDING THAT UNIFORM

00:27:00.418 --> 00:27:01.453
GUIDANCE GOT STATE. AND

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.354
SUGGESTED THAT I HEARD

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:03.989
CORRECTLY COVERS ONE TO ONE SO

00:27:04.055 --> 00:27:06.758
THERE IS NO HARM TO BUSINESSES

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:08.126
THAT PROVIDE THIS SICK LEAVE.

00:27:08.193 --> 00:27:09.627
ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC I

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:12.063
APPRECIATE THAT RESPONSE- I HAD

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.531
ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION I

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:14.866
THINK WE'RE SO CLOSE TO SEEING

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:18.103
THE END OF THIS. PANDEMIC AND

00:27:18.169 --> 00:27:18.737
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT HIS

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.072
COMPANY TO. BUT ONE OF THE KEYS

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.774
IS GOING TO BE VACCINATIONS AND

00:27:22.841 --> 00:27:24.409
WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:24.976
CONCERNED ABOUT VACCINATION

00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:27.479
ROLLOUT. ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS

00:27:27.545 --> 00:27:29.481
AROUND TAKE UP AND THOSE WHO

00:27:29.547 --> 00:27:31.082
INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT NOT BE

00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:33.284
WILLING FOR SOME REASON TO TAKE

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:36.454
THE VACCINE- IN I GUESS I'D I

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.356
KNOW I KNOW THIS BILL HAS BEEN.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.792
HARD COPY THE HARD NEGOTIATED

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.927
AND IT'S IN A LATE POINT AND SO

00:27:42.994 --> 00:27:44.562
I DON'T. WANT TO PUSH

00:27:44.629 --> 00:27:46.264
AMENDMENTS TO THIS BUT I WOULD

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:47.465
SUGGEST THAT AS WE THINK ABOUT

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.234
THINGS GOING FORWARD- IT WOULD

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.602
HAVE STRUCK ME AS A GOOD IDEA

00:27:50.668 --> 00:27:52.437
TO CONSIDER REQUIRING

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.205
VACCINATIONS FOR ANY EMPLOYEE

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:57.275
OR WORKER THAT- OR AN EXCUSE IF

00:27:57.342 --> 00:27:58.376
THEY WANT TO OPT OUT BUT BUT

00:27:58.443 --> 00:28:02.247
SOME. VALID REASON FOR A WORKER-TO NOT GET VACCINATED BECAUSE I

00:28:02.313 --> 00:28:03.248
THINK WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING

00:28:03.314 --> 00:28:04.649
VACCINATIONS THAT'S GONNA BE

00:28:04.716 --> 00:28:07.385
KEY FOR US GETTING OUT OF THIS

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:11.089
PANDEMIC. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR.

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:13.258

ESPECIALLY PEOPLE CODE WHICH IS

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:32.544
A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE ARE ABLE

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:34.646
TO ACTUALLY- ISOLATE. IT'S NOT

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:37.015
ENOUGH TO SIMPLY TEST PEOPLE

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:39.617
AND- EVEN CONTACT TRACE THEM TO

00:28:39.684 --> 00:28:40.752
FIND OUT WHETHER THEY EXPOSED

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:41.686
BUT ALSO IF THEY'VE BEEN

00:28:41.753 --> 00:28:44.656
EXPOSED OR SYMPTOMATIC OR- ARE

00:28:44.722 --> 00:28:46.558
ASYMPTOMATIC AND TRYING TO

FIRESTEEL STAY HOME SO- TO HELP

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.528
PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF THIS

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:54.199
DISEASE WHICH ALSO IF IT

00:28:54.265 --> 00:28:55.166
CONTINUES TO SPREAD. NOW AS IT

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:56.835
SPREAD CERTAINLY- THEN

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.303
DISCOURAGES PEOPLEFROM BEING

ABLE TO DO WORK OR- SHOPPER DO

00:29:00.805 --> 00:29:02.373
WHATEVER OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.041
NECESSARY TO HELP SUPPORT

00:29:03.108 --> 00:29:05.643
BUSINESS. I GUESS MY QUESTION

00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:09.147
IS THAT- HI IN RELATION TO NOT

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:11.182
ONLY FOR WHAT WOULD BE ON SO WE

00:29:11.249 --> 00:29:12.817
BASICALLY BUDGET A HUNDRED

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.919
THOUSAND FOR- STAFFING RESOURCE

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.254
LABOR COMMISSIONER WHICH MAKES

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:18.723
SENSE BUT- TO WHAT DEGREE ARE

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:20.258
WE ACTUALLY INFORMING SMALL

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:23.528
BUSINESSES THEMSELVES- THAT

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:25.763
EIGHT. OF THE SPECIFICS OF NOT

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DOING

00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.108
BUT I THINK SOMETIMES IT'S

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:37.942
BECAUSE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:40.445
HAVE- ACTED INFORMATION AND

00:29:40.512 --> 00:29:42.647

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.395
PROACTIVE ABOUT THAT AND IN

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.464

PROPERLY. BUT THERE ARE-

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:47.979
TREMENDOUS NUMBER OF

ORGANIZATIONS IN OPPOSITION.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:52.216

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:55.419
THOUSANDS THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:58.456

ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE PUBLISHED

EMPLOYER DOESN'T ROOM- ADDRESS

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:17.900
THE CONCERNS AND SO. IF THEY

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:21.270
WERE TO TAKE THE LEAVE. BACK

01:12:21.336 --> 01:12:22.504
PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THIS

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.506
BILL AND NOW WITH THE ENACTMENT

01:12:24.573 --> 01:12:26.241
OF THIS BILL THEY CLAIM THAT

01:12:26.308 --> 01:12:27.476

SPECIFICALLY FOR CULTIVATED.

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:30.679
THEN THE EMPLOYER HAS THE

OPPORTUNITY TO THEN PROVIDE

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:33.882

RETROACTIVELY ONLY IN THE CASE

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.754
WHERE THEY DON'T. PROVIDE THAT

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:40.255
THEN ENFORCEMENT WOULD TAKE

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:41.957
AFFECT AND HERE EARLIER

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.526
QUESTION ON THE EXPLANATION FOR

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:47.129
THE EIGHTY HOURS IT'S MY IT'S

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.731
AS I STATED THAT THE SECTION

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.632
SPECIFICALLY SAYS EIGHTY HOURS

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.534
FOR THE ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.269

THAT THE OTHER- CONCERNS WITH

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:59.942
THE RETROACTIVITY- QUICKLY

01:13:00.008 --> 01:13:01.910
LOOKING AT THAT NOW- THAT

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:04.113
SECTION IT SPECIFIES FOR ANY

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.981
FOR ANY SEXUALLY TAKEN IF THE

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.516
EMPLOYER DOES NOT COMPENSATE IN

01:13:07.583 --> 01:13:09.151
THE FULL AMOUNT EQUAL OR

01:13:09.218 --> 01:13:11.019
GREATER TO THE AMOUNT OF. THE

01:13:11.086 --> 01:13:13.756
SUPPLEMENTAL PAID SICK LEAVE.

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:15.524
THEN- THE EMPLOYER SHALL. THEY

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:16.625
SHOULD BE PROVIDING THEM THAT

01:13:16.692 --> 01:13:19.194
RETROACTIVITY PAYMENT AND SO IF

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:20.596
THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THAT

01:13:20.662 --> 01:13:22.197
THEN THE ENFORCEMENT DOES TAKE

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:25.234
EFFECT. IS THERE A DISPUTE

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.336
MECHANISM WHAT IF THE EMPLOYER

01:13:27.402 --> 01:13:28.103
DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT THE

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.371
EMPLOYEE ACTUALLY TOOK THE

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:30.906
COVERT LEAVE FOR COVERT

01:13:30.973 --> 01:13:32.741
SITUATIONS IN PREVIOUS

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.243
LEGISLATION THERE WAS A DISPUTE

01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:35.644
WITH THE EMPLOYER. I MEAN THERE

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:36.812
IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE

01:13:36.879 --> 01:13:37.880
MEDICAL PROVIDER HAD TO SAY

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.281
LOOK HE'S BEEN EXPOSED- HE

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.884
SHE'S BEEN EXPOSED TO COLLUDED-

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:42.317
AND SHOULD THEREFORE

01:13:42.384 --> 01:13:44.820
QUARANTINE- IS THERE ANYTHING

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:45.988
LIKE THAT THAT'S A DISPUTE OR

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.090
DUE PROCESS FOR THE EMPLOYER OR

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.324
IS IT JUST AUTOMATICALLY ON

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.226
DEMAND FOR ANYBODY THAT SAYS.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:54.163
THAT THE- WANT THAT TIME OFF

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:55.798
YES SO THIS DOESN'T THIS

01:13:55.864 --> 01:13:57.065
DOESN'T DIFFER FROM ANY OTHER

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.801
SICK LEAVE PROVISIONS THEY ARE

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.803
NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A

01:14:00.869 --> 01:14:04.640
NOTIFICATION ALTHOUGH- ONE MAY

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:07.576
BE. ONE MAY BE ASKED FOR THE-

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:09.912
THE INPUT FROM THE EMPLOYEE- IN

01:14:09.978 --> 01:14:12.481
ORDER TO PAY FOR THAT BUT- THIS

01:14:12.548 --> 01:14:14.416
IS THE COMPLIANCE OR THE

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.351
ENFORCEMENT AS IT IS SIMILAR TO

01:14:16.418 --> 01:14:17.786
EXISTING PAID SICK LEAVE

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:21.256
PROVISIONS. OKAY SO THERE IS NO

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.158
ABILITY TO ASK BECAUSE THAT'S-

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.526
I BELIEVE A VIOLATION OF STATE

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.062
LAW FOR- HIT BACK IF THEY CAN'T

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.363
SIMPLE YEAH OKAY SO THERE'S NO

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:30.332
ABILITY ASK. AND THEN- DID YOU

01:14:30.399 --> 01:14:31.967
WORRY I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:33.101
TO THOSE QUESTIONS WERE YOU

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:33.902
ABLE TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ON

01:14:33.969 --> 01:14:35.304
THE ONE TO ONE MATCH. BECAUSE

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.505
LIKE I SAID I KNOW THE STATE

01:14:36.572 --> 01:14:37.673
HAS A FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:40.442
DOLLAR CAP- OR A TOTAL OF FIVE

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.211
THOUSAND WHATEVER. AT BUT THIS

01:14:42.277 --> 01:14:43.946
FEDERAL BILL SAYS TWO HUNDRED

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:45.881
DOLLARS IN MOST CASES OF THE

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:46.515
THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN DOLLAR

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:49.284
DIFFERENCE WOULD COME FROM THE

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:49.751
EMPLOYER WITHOUT A TAX

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:53.288
REIMBURSEMENT. CORRECT OR NOT-

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:54.623
I'M SORRY I'M NOT I'M NOT AWARE

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:56.391

THAT CAPS THAT WE DECIDED

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.994
BEFORE AND I'M- I BELIEVE I

SAID REFLECT TENANTS IT'S FIVE

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:04.066
ELEVEN SO POLICIES. BY THE-

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:06.602
THEY SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:08.770
WHAT'S IN THE FEDERAL BILL.

01:15:08.837 --> 01:15:10.572
THEY SHOULD BE OKAY THEY ARE

01:15:10.639 --> 01:15:11.306
