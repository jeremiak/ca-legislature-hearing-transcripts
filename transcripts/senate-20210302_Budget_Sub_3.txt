GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU AYE CHAIR EGGMAN- CAN ACQUIRE WEIGHT ON THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING WOULD LIKE ME TO BEGIN. I WOULD THINK YOU'D MISS WAY. THANK YOU. BOB WE- OF COURSE- SEEING SOME HOPE ON THE HER BUT ARE SO GREAT FOR THAT TO TALK ABOUT THE YEAR THAT HAS COME BEFORE AND ALL THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO MEET THE UNPRECEDENTED I NEED BY ALSO MANY IN OUR STATE- I WAS BE PRECLUDED THREE QUESTIONS THAT WERE IN THE AGENDA- AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE WHOLE PANEL CONVERSATION. AS WELL. SO ARE THE PART OF AGING PROGRAM INTERNET. OF AGE DISABILITY AND CARE GIVER PROVIDERS. HIDDEN THREE WAYS TO RESPOND. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE VIRTUAL. OUR SENIOR CENTERS ARE IN PERSON ADULT DAY HEALTH HAD TO. GO TO REMOTE. ON MOST. NOTABLY PROBABLY. ARE HUNDRED MEALS WITH ALL HOME DELIVERY SO THAT WAS A HUGE CHANGE IN SERVICE TO MOVE FROM THE FOLLOWING COURT AND FAILURE COMING TOGETHER. TO BE ON THE PHONE ONLINE DELIVERY DOORSTEP IN OUR NETWORK MADE IT HAPPEN. THE SECOND BIG CHANGE WAS THE INCREASE. WITH MORE PEOPLE STAYING HOME THERE WAS A HUGE NEED FOR MORE INFORMATION. FOR ASSISTANCE MORE PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE NEEDED MEALS AT HOME NEEDING AND PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT A NEEDED LEGAL SERVICES BEFORE NEEDING THEM. SO AN INCREASE IN SERVICES. AND I WOULD SAY THIRTY AREA OF COURSE ISN'T GAPS. WERE EXPOSED- WHETHER IT WAS IN. CERTAIN POPULATIONS WHERE WE WERE NOT AS WELL- SERVING THAT WE WANTED TO MEET BETTER FOR EXAMPLE LANGUAGE ACCESS. OR TYPE OF SERVICE SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THAT WE WANTED TO DO MORE ON. SO MOVING ON ALL THREE OF THOSE AREAS TO GO VIRTUAL TO SERVE MORE PEOPLE AND TO SERVICE NEW AND EMERGING NEEDS- WE'RE OUR TOP PRIORITIES. MOVING TO QUESTION TO ME WERE A- OF FORTUNE TO USE THOSE- ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS IN A COUPLE OF WAYS. AS I INDICATED I PRIMARILY ON INCREASING SERVICES THE FIRST OCULUS PACKAGE WAS FOR MEAL SPECIFICALLY AND WE DID FINISH THE YEAR WITH A RECORD NUMBER OF HOME DELIVERED MEALS TWENTY SEVEN MILLION. THAT'S IN ADDITION TO GREAT PLATES AND OTHER GREAT WORK OF NUTRITION PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT- WE ALSO WERE ABLE I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR NETWORK- WE PULL TOGETHER WE PULL TOGETHER AND PULL TOGETHER. SOME OF OUR FEDERAL FUNDS TO PROVIDE SOME STATEWIDE RESPONSES FOR EXAMPLE. WORKING WITH A. R. P. AND DMV WE MAILED A POSTCARD OF INFORMATION RESOURCES TO CALIFORNIA'S TWO POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY. SO THAT PEOPLE HAD INFORMATION AT HOME ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN CALL WHETHER IT WAS THE H. P. A. R. P. FRONTLINE FOR. THE STATE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES LINE FOR MY COLLEAGUES THAT CDS CLASS- THAT THEY HAD- THAT INFORMATION. AND PERHAPS OUR OUR ONE OF OUR OUR OUR- MOST PROUD ACCOMPLISHMENTS TOGETHER IS EXPANDING THE FRIENDSHIP LINE. WHICH PREVIOUSLY IT ONLY SERVES OLDER ADULTS IN THE BAY AREA WE TOOK IT STATEWIDE. AND THE FRENCH WINE AS THE NAME SUGGESTS IS A TWENTY FOUR HOUR SEVEN. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN A WARM LINE WHERE YOU CAN CALL IT FEEL YOU WANT TO CHAT. AND TALK TO SOMEONE ANY TIME TO ADDRESS LONELINESS. AND DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND MORE AND SO WE'RE VERY PROUD OF FRIENDSHIP LINE. CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO BE STATEWIDE. AND WE ALSO TAKE IN CHANCE. TO LOOK AT OURSELVES AND IF THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITY TO MODERN AND THREE. OR AT A MOVIE OUR NETWORK INTO ONE- UNIFY CAN. SYSTEM WHICH WILL HELP US WITH- MINIMIZING ARE. AWESOME OF OUR ADMIN- BURDEN AND ALSO THE MORE REAL TIME DATA AND RESPONSIVENESS. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE WAYS WE PUT THE MONEY TO USE. THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED OUT OF THIS ARE REALLY ARE DRIVING ARE PLANNING IN SO MANY WAYS- FROM AGING PLANNING TO MASTER PLANNING. WHEN WE WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT IT IS THE UNIVERSE OF NEED NOW COMING OUT OF THE ENDEMIC. NEITHER WAS THERE BEFORE NEED THAT IS NEW NEED THAT MAY BE A RESULT OF THE LOSSES EXPERIENCED DURING THE PANDEMIC I JUST REALLY ON THE WORLD THAT WERE MERGING INTO AND WANT TO MAKE SURE WE REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE CALIFORNIANS WHO WE NEED TO SERVE. ON THE EQUITY LINES AGAIN ARE GIVEN THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF BOTH THE HEALTH IMPACT OF CODE AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF CODE. AND THE LINGERING LEGACY OF RACISM IN OTHER DISCRIMINATION REALLY- HOLDING OUR SERVICES TO ACCOUNT FOR BOTH MEETING THE NEED AND BEING TOTALLY RESPONSIVE AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT IN EVERY WAY. AND THEN WE ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THAT LESSONS A VIRTUAL SERVICES WHAT CAN WE BRING FORWARD WHERE OUR VIRTUAL SERVICES. A WONDERFUL IN TERMS OF SAVING TRANSPORTATION INCREASING ACCESSIBILITY- CONNECTING WITH NATIONAL RESOURCES- AND WHERE ARE THE NO SUBSTITUTE FOR THE IN PERSON GATHERING AND CONTACT THAT WE ALL MISSED SO MUCH. AND THEN LASTLY WELL- ANOTHER LESSEN THE PANDEMIC IS WHERE CAN WE STREAMLINED ACROSS THAT WE WERE% ABLE TO GET. THE STIMULUS RESOURCES OUT TO OUR NETWORK FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE AND WE WANT TO MAKE THAT THE NEW NORM. IN OUR ON GOING FUNDING AS WELL. LAST I TOUCHED ON THE ALREADY SENIOR. HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PANDEMIC. EARLY ON AS WE TALKED ABOUT. THE NEED TO PHYSICALLY ISOLATE AND STAY HOME AND STAY JUST INSTANCE A SEPARATE WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE WERE REACHING OUT WITH- DAY INFORMATION AND SO MANY CHANNELS ABOUT HOW TO STAY CONNECTED. WITH THE FRENCH OF LINES THAT YOU CAN ALWAYS REACH OUT YOURSELF AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND THEN MORE RECENTLY WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING ON THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- OLDER ADULTS HAVE SOME OF THE LEAST- PRESENCE ONLINE AND WE KNOW THAT THAT TAKES A COMBINATION OF STRATEGIES. ON MAKING BROADBAND- ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE DEVICES EASY AND ACCESSIBLE TO USE AND MEANINGFUL CONTENT IN SUPPORT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN WHETHER IT'S A TELEHEALTH VISIT FOR A VIDEO CHAT WITH FAMILY OR RELIGIOUS SERVICE FOR EXERCISE CLASS ABOUT IS ALL AVAILABLE TO THEM SO. BEGIN USING FEDERAL FUNDS AND PLANTER P. PARTNERSHIPS WE STARTED DISTRIBUTING THROUGH OUR NETWORK IPADS AND SMART SPEAKERS WITH PACKAGES SO THAT WE CAN- YOU ARE PART. TO HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WITH OLDER ADULTS. WITHOUT STOPPING HABITS. ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THE FIRST CLASS THE FINANCE THANK. HELLO. NOTHING OKAY AB AND I THINK WE'LL JUST GO TO THE PANEL NOW THOSE WHO WANT TO ASK A QUESTION SPECIFICALLY HERE WE HAVE A PANEL THAT'S RELATED TO THE SAME. THE REST OF THE- FROM SOCIAL SERVICES RIGHT YEAH MAJOR. YEAH I THINK WILL MOVE NOW TO THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES I SEE DIRECTOR JOHNSON HERE JOINING US GOOD AFTERNOON AFTERNOON STATEMENT AND SENATOR PANEL BUT GLAD TO BE WITH YOU THIS AFTERNOON- CAN JOHNSON DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES I JUST BUILDING ON AGAIN YOUR GENDER DOES A GREAT JOB OF OUTLINING SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITY TO. BE PUT IN PLACE WHERE THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE PUT IN PLACE AND I WILL SHORTLY TURN IT OVER TO OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT DEVON THOMPSON I JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT BUT AGAIN JUST TREMENDOUS EFFORTS AND ALL FRIENDS. IT COURSE AT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALREADY HEARD A BIT MORE ABOUT OUR SPECIFIC SUPPORTS AROUND FOOD I JUST WANT TO RE HIGHLIGHTS AT THAT IN THIS SPACE IN ADDITION TO ARE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINES AT IN THE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR CALFRESH PROGRAM IN THAT EXPANSION. TOURIST SSI RECIPIENTS OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE PAST YEAR I ALSO JUST WANT TO YOU TAKE ONE MOMENT IN TERMS OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU. RAISED RELATED TO HOW OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR I BRIDGES INTO WHAT WE'RE THINKING FORWARD IN SUPPORTING OUR POPULATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND SO JUST TO GIVE BRIDGING THE CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST WEEK RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS. IT'S NOT ONLY- OUR ABILITY THROUGH OUR IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS OUR ELDERS AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES TO STAY HOME AND GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED AT HOME BUT ALSO THROUGH THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUUM AND OF COURSE THAT'S CRITICAL- WHETHER WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE I JUST AS PROGRAM OR OTHER SUPPORTS. DON'T SEEM SENIOR CARE WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE LATER JUST WANTED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY THAT THESE RESOURCES. AND PROGRAMS ARE PART AS A WHOLE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF RESOURCES AND MOVING FORWARD SO I WILL BECAUSE THERE AND TURN IT OVER TO A DEPUTY DIRECTOR DEBBIE THOMPSON GETS MORE SPECIFICS. THANK YOU. I AFTERNOON THIS DEBBIE. DEPUTY TO. FOR AT THE ADULT PROGRAMS PERMITTED SOCIAL. AND WAS GOING TO SHOW WITH YOU- SOME OF THIS THINGS ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE DONE TO SUPPORT OUR PROGRAM IN OUR RECIPIENTS THOSE THAT WE SERVE AND THE PROVIDERS THAT pCARE FOR THEM I DURING DURING THIS TIME. SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT- WAS IMPLEMENTED IT WAS WE DID IMPLEMENTED THAT FEDERAL PAID SICK LEAVE I FOUR FOUR CULMINATED TO CODED FOR OUR PROVIDERS THAT BEGAN LAST APRIL AND WILL CONTINUE TO RUN THE THREE TWO THIS COMING MARCH THE END OF THIS COMING MARCH- IT ALLOWS. REUTERS THAT ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO QUARANTINE OR TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE OR IS L. OR L. THEMSELVES OR WHOSE CHILDREN ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AT SCHOOL AND HAVE TO BE CARED FOR. TO TAKE UP TO TWO WEEKS OF. AB HEATED SICK LEAVE- RELATED TO THE- AMOUNT OF AVERAGE HOURS THAT THEY WORK IN THAT TWO WEEK PERIOD. SO THAT WAS ONE ACTIVITY. ANOTHER WAY AS WE WORKED WITH THE COUNTIES AND ALL OF THE COUNTIES IMPLEMENTED UPBACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEM. FOR TO SUPPORT RECIPIENTS WHOSE PROVIDERS WORK OUT. DUE TO A CO THAT RELATED SITUATION. THAT THEY COULD. ASSIST THEM IN GETTING UP BACK UP PROVIDER IN PLACE TO ENSURE THERE'S HERE NEEDS WERE MET. ANY PROVIDERS THAT. WORKSHEET IN THE SIX. WERE ALSO PAID A TWO DOLLAR AN HOUR DIFFERENTIAL- TO THEIR REGULAR WAGES AND THE COUNTY THAT THEY WERE PROVIDING THAT THE SERVICE. SO THEY GOT AN ADDITIONAL. TWO DOLLARS AN HOUR IN ORDER TO SUPPORT RECIPIENTS IN THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED SUPPORTING OUR- PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS IN ABLE AND BEING ABLE TO ACCESS- ESSENTIAL PROTECTIVE GEAR MASKS AND GLOVES- SO THAT WE CAN. HELP SUPPORT YEAH. PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS AND NOT BEING EXPOSED TO KOBE AND- AND THOSE WERE DISTRIBUTED AND CLICK THE COORDINATION OF THEIR DISTRIBUTION WAS DONE THROUGH THE LOCAL PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN EACH COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY WE HAD BOTH HSS AND APS WERE PROVIDED FUNDS TO DO OUTREACH TO RECIPIENTS ABOUT THE RESOURCES THAT WERE AVAILABLE TO THEM GET THEM CONNECTED TO NEEDED RESOURCES FOR SITUATIONS THEY MAY BE EXPERIENCING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR OWN HOME- WE ALSO HAVE PROVIDED FUNDING TO SUPPORT OVER TIME FOR SOCIAL WORKERS. DURING THAT PERIOD- TO ENSURE THAT- THAT OUTREACH AND SUPPORT HAPPENING FOR OUR RECIPIENTS. ARE MEANT. SORRY. ONCE MY PAGE THEN ALSO- WE DID OUT CREATES WAIVERS FOR EXCEEDING OVER TIME- RULES PROVIDERS ARE ALLOWED TO WORK SIXTY SIX HOURS A WEEK IN ADVANCE THAT- DATE COULD BE SET UP. BUT RECEIVED VIOLATIONS THOSE VIOLATIONS WERE WERE REMOVED SENATE PROVIDERS COULD WORK OVERTIME DURING THAT PERIOD IT TO ENSURE THAT SERVICES WERE GETTING TO ARE RECIPIENTS. OF THE OTHER FLEXIBILITY IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE COUNTIES IN DOING THEIR WORK AND ENSURING THAT THEIR STAFF AS WELL AS THE RECIPIENTS THAT THEY- THAT THEY WERE SEEING WERE EXPOSED- TWO CODED. AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE- THE ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE NORMALLY DONE IN PERSON WERE ALLOWED TO BE DONE THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCING AND ALL OUR- THROUGH PHONE ASSESSMENTS IN ORDER TO LIMIT THAT CONTACT ALSO FORMS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED BY OUR RECIPIENTS AND- TO. VERIFY THEIR- THERE NEED OF THIS. WERE ALLOWED TO BE- OUTPOST BY- IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET ON SERVICES AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ALLOWED TO DO SELF ATTESTATION IN LIEU OF- SIGNATURES ON FORMS IN ORDER TO PROCESS PAPER WORK AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- ON THE PROVIDER SIDE. THE ORIENTATIONS THAT PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO ATTEND WERE TRANSITIONED INTO REMOTE- TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO COMPLETE THE PROCESS TO BE ABLE TO BECOME ELIGIBLE AND ENROLLED AS PROVIDERS. SO JUST LOTS OF- SUPPORT AND FLEXIBILITIES A LOT OF IT MOVING TO REMOTE- ARMY AT IN ORDER TO SUPPORT- ARE RECIPIENTS- DURING THIS TIME THAT OUR PROVIDERS AND BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO CARE FOR THE RECIPIENTS AND ENSURE THAT THEY GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. I'M I'M GONNA STOP THERE REGARDING WHAT WE DID FOR EIGHT FOUR I JUST ASK AND HIM- RUTLEDGE WAS WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT THAT THE FLEXIBILITIES THAT WE DID PROVIDE TO OUR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES- THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DEBBIE- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- JUST BRIEFLY TOUCH ON OF WHAT WE COVERED- FOR CONSIDER RESPONSE REYES ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AND HISTORICALLY WE SEE AN INCREASE IN REPORTS RECEIVING CASES OPEN FROM ONE YEAR TO THE FOLLOWING AT EIGHT PM. HOWEVER DUE TO CO THAT EIGHT PSI TEN POINT 5% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REPORTS RECEIVED A SIX POINT 5% DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OPEN FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE TWENTY TWENTY FOR THE FIRST FOUR MONTHS OF THE CAN DOWN THAT AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS DECREASE IN THE REPORTS WITH BECAUSE- SENIOR THE VULNERABLE ADULTS WE'RE NOT GOING TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS- POTENTIALLY TO OTHER SERVICES THAT THEY RECEIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. SO THEY WEREN'T HAVING THAT SAME- INTERACTION WITH MANDATED REPORTERS AND OTHERS YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLAG CASES OF ABUSE OR NEGLECT- SO IN RESPONSE TO ALL OF THIS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IN THE PROGRAM HE CONTINUED OUTREACH TO THIS POPULATION- FIRST OF ALL AND WE ALLOWED FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY MUCH LIKE AN ISIS US AS MY COLLEAGUE MATT SOMETHING JUST MENTIONED- BUT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE- SOCIAL WORKERS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO INITIAL AND FOLLOW UP. THAT ME A PHONE OR VIDEO CHAT UNLESS THEY WERE RESPONDING TO A CASE OF PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE IN THOSE INSTANCES WE STILL REQUIRED- ADDITION WORKER TO GO DIRECTLY INTO THE HOME AND THAT THE FORMER HOME DOES THAT THAT FOR ALL OTHER CASES WE PIVOTED OVER TO DELAY- AND IN. A WAY FROM THE IN PERSON VISITS AND- INTO DOING THE VIDEO OR PHONE VISITS DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME- WE ALSO RECEIVED SPENDING MUCH LIKE IHS DONE TO DO OUTREACH CALLS TO EXISTING APS CLIENT- WE DID OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE WELL MCCALL'S APS CLIENTS BETWEEN APRIL AND JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY WITHOUT. SENDING THAT WE RECEIVE YOU COULD DO THAT ACTIVITY- WE ALSO WORK IN WITH THE OF A- AND WITH AND HUMAN AGENCY TO A CENTRAL EIGHT NINE THE REPORT ELDER IN THE A ABUSE STATE- DAY PASSES THAT ADMIN PROGRAM- OFF. THE WAY REPORT COME IN VERY KEY- SOMEBODY HAVE TO REPORT YOUR TO THE K. ANY CASE TODAY ONE TO HAVE AND THAT- DECREASE OF THE DAY HUNDRED GIVE DEFENSE LINE THAT CALLING TRUE WE COMES. WE NEED TO INJURY YOUR ZIP IT FUTURE TO THE COUNTY ONLINE AND WE RECEIVED AVERAGE A LITTLE OVER HUNDRED CALLS WEEK HE THAT EIGHT HUNDRED- THAT THAT'D BEEN REAL CRAZY AND PEOPLE ADDITIONAL WEIGHTS REPORT ABUSE. AND NEGLECT- ALL WE HAVE HAD HAVE IT- ALL OF TRAINING FOR API OCEAN. STATE WHY- FROM THAT IN CLASS THREE OR INTO TRAIN TO- AND ONLINE AND THE LEARNING MY- AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE. O TRAIN NUMBER SIX THOUSAND SOCIAL. AND LEARN MODEL AND SINCE PANDEMIC BEGAN- THE BIG WAYS RIGHT NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RESPOND TO CHO SAID. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO MENTION WITH REGARD TO COMMITTED RESPONSE IS THAT- IN THE MINISTRY SAID- A CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE IN RELEASED- I'M ASK THAT WAS AFTER THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FEDERALLY- ALL APS PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE- WERE OFFERED AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR A GRANT TO ENHANCE. APS RESPONDED SO THAT NINETEEN- AND THIS IS A FORMULA GRANTS TO ALL STATES AUTOMATICALLY GET IT- WERE IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING- ALL AND THAT PEOPLE WORKS RECEIVED. WHAT WILL AMOUNT TO AROUND NINE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR CALIFORNIA FOR APS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY TO RESPOND TO COVERAGE RELATED NEEDS- WE SHOULD RECEIVE THAT MONEY- BY EARLY APRIL. WERE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND HE W. D. A. TO. PUT TOGETHER A FORMULA TO DISSEMINATE THIS MONEY TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND AT THAT POINT WE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDING THEM WITH GUIDANCE ON HOW TO SPEND THE MONEY- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH US THAT IS. THE FUNDS ARE USED. TO SUPPLEMENT- APS WORKS SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO CO THEY DO NOT JUSTIFY WHAT IS ALREADY HAPPENING. SO WE ARE GOING TO BE CREATING SOME PARAMETERS THAT COUNTIES MUST WORK AROUND WITH THE MONEY THAT THEY RECEIVE- AND THEY WILL HAVE ROUGHLY EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO USE THAT MONEY- WE'RE LOOKING FOR HONORABLY. AND DIRECT SERVICES- EXPANSION AS HOUSING PRO- MAKING SURE THAT CLIENTS HAVE FOOD RESTORE. BEYOND MAY BE A- REAL TIME FOR A SHORT THROUGH GREAT- TRIPS. ESPECIALLY MEDIC APPOINT ARE BACK OF WHAT- ATS FINANCE- IN PERTH- HOME THE FOR THE PUBLIC NURSE. BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT MANY EIGHT PLAN FROM NOW GONE TO DOCTOR HAD ANY KIND OF I WOULD IN OUR- WITH WITH. ARE THE PAST YEARS- OPENING DRAFT- WILL ALSO TO OUR THE CAN. AND OPPORTUNITY DO AT. THE OTHER. FOR ANY IN HERE THAT IS BEEN YOUR IMPACT BY THAT DIFFICULTY RIGHT NOW IT YOU ARE. IF MANAGED LAUGHTER NINETY DAYS. SO COUNTY WILL BE ABLE TO USE AND I THAT TO. THAT AS WELL- SO WE THAT. THOSE ARE- THE AT THE FOR HOW OBJECT SERVICES FUNDS. TO CO THE- AND OF THE ANY CLUB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK NOW WILL GO THE PANEL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AS BY PAN KATHY WITH THE COUNTY WALKER THAT SHE SENT NAY TO SEE IT TODAY. THANK YOU FOR THE M. TO BE ON THE TODAY WELL WE HAVE THREE QUESTIONS AT ALL AFTER. FIRST AND THINK ABOUT THE THAT COUNT THE FACE THE NEXT IN PROVIDING. TO OLDER AND DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND- ISSUES. AS MANY OR- THAT SERVE OLDER IN VULNERABLE. CAN AND HAS. VISITING THE END OF WE SERVE ARE PRO SHOULD. ABUSE AND THE CONDUCT I JUST THAT INTO AND RIO SOUTH. FOR PRO ELIGIBILITY HAS DEFINITELY BEEN A CHALLENGE DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS THESE ARE OFTEN THE MOST AT RISK FOR COBIT EXPOSURE AND SERIOUS ILLNESS. EARLY IN THE PANDA I'M PRETTY WHERE WE RECEIVE REPORTS FROM COUNTY IS THAT BOTH THE APS. THAT'S CLIENTS WORD DOES NOT COMFORTABLE ALLOWING SOMEONE TO COME INTO THEIR HOME. AND FOR THESE REASONS WE APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE VFF ACCRUE. SUCH AS ALLOWING THE VIRTUAL IN HOME ASSESSMENT THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT- AND REASSESSMENTS- AS WELL AS- I INITIAL INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE LEFT THE AREA- THE ALLEGATIONS AND APS. IN ALLOWING COUNTIES. TO PROCESS THE FORMS ELECTRONICALLY. COUNTIES ALSO HAVE FACED A ISSUE WITH OUR STAY AT HOME ORDERS- WORK FROM HOME AND ACCOMMODATING STAFF OR AT RISK OR EXPOSURE DOES TO A CHILD CARE OR OTHER CARE GIVING DUTIES. THE ACCESS OF OUR STAFF TO PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WAS ALSO INITIAL EARLIER ON THE THAT IS LESS OF AN ISSUE NOW IT WAS A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE EARLY AND THAT PANDEMIC- AND WIDE AT BOTH LOCALLY AND- OUT KIND OF. TALKING STATEWIDE WITH THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AT A LOCAL- YES OFFICERS WERE ARE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES STAFF WERE WIND OUT OF YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF. GROUPS AND COUNTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT NEEDED THOSE EQUIPMENT AS FIRST RESPONDERS. IN IN THE WAY THAT FUNDS TO HELP SERVE OLDER ADULTS. AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES DID RECEIVE SOME OF THE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE STATE TO DO WELL IN THE ABSTRACT ON OLDER ADULTS AND BOTH APS AND I JUST BASS. SO WE WERE ABLE TO- GET OUT EITHER- LITERALLY OR VIRTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO CHECK IN WITH OUR CLIENTS AND SEE HOW THEY WERE DOING AND CONNECT THEM AND ARRANGE SERVICES AS THEY MAY BE NEEDED THOSE BUT DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE ELSE LOOKING AROUND THAT. MUCH OF THE- FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE DID COME IN THE FORM OF FEDERAL MATCH ON PROGRAMS SUCH AS PROJECT ROOM HE- WHICH HELPS LOCAL ENTITIES PROVIDE NON CONGREGATE SHELTER. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF IT. AS ALWAYS A GREAT PLACE PROGRAM WHICH PARTNERED WITH LOCAL RESTAURANTS. TO DELIVER FOOD TO SENIORS WHICH OF MANY OF OUR COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES ADMINISTER IN SOME CAPACITY. WITH BOTH ROOM HE AND GREAT PLAINS COUNTY FROM GREAT SUCCESS AND WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE ALMOST NINE THOUSAND MEALS WERE DELIVERED THROUGH GREAT FAITH AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE. AND THEN- ADDRESSING THE FINAL QUESTION ON THE AGENDA THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM ISSUES THAT WE MIGHT EXPECT TO FACE. AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- WE THINK THAT- THE SEVERAL THINGS HAVE BEEN HITTING OUR CLIENT POPULATION HARD ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS OF COURSE BUT- FOCUSING JUST FOR A MINUTE ON OUR OLDER ADULTS. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ALL AND THE ELDER- WHO ARE ARE RECEIVING SERVICES TO OUR PROGRAM OR WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE EDGE OF NEEDING THOSE SERVICES AT ONE TIME PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE AFFECT ON THE HOUSING CRISIS THE WORSENING ECONOMIC SITUATION MAY NOW NEED THOSE SERVICES WERE AS THEY WERE. STRUGGLING BUT MAKING IT IT ABLE TO GET BY AND NOW IN NEED OF OUR SERVICES. WE THINK THAT THE IN PARTICULAR THE POPULATIONS OF OLDER ADULTS THAT WE SERVE WHAT THAT WE KNOW HAVE BEEN GROWING OVER TIME AS WELL AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HAD HEART. WE THINK THAT A NUMBER OF A LARGER NUMBER OF THOSE WE SERVE ARE GOING TO STRUGGLE WITH HOUSING ISSUES AS WELL AS AN INCREASED NEED FOR MORE SERVICES AND CONNECTIONS TO BE MADE RELATED TO FOOD SECURITY HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AS WE SPEAK- SO MUCH ATTENTION PAID ON. THE TOLL THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF THE TOLL THAT ARE FOR INTERVENING AND- HOME SCHOOLING HAVE TAKEN ON CHILDREN NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE PEOPLE FIFTEEN I THINK CAN BE TRUE FOR ELDERS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND VULNERABLE ADULTS YOU MAY HAVE HAD PROGRAMS OR- YOU KNOW AS I WEEKLY- VISIT WITH FRIENDS. WHO NOW CAN NO LONGER DO THAT AND SO THINKING ABOUT THEM AT THAT END OF THE AGE SPECTRUM AND HOW WE CAN PROVIDE SERVICES AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT OUT IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD PASSED THE PANDEMIC. WE HAVE A COUPLE FROM. THAT ARE ADDRESSED LATER IN THE AGENDA THAT I JUST WANNA TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY NOW BECAUSE THEY DO FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY OF ONGOING NEEDS. FIRST OF ALL ARE EXPOSED- WE HAVE A PROPOSAL TO EXPAND SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. INCLUDING THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH IS A HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM THAT IS TARGETED DIRECTLY AT OUR ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES POPULATION. LEAVES ARE INTO THE GROWING POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AND IT WOULD PROVIDE FOR EARLIER INTERVENTION BY LOWERING THE AGE TO SIXTY. THAT THESE- OLDER ADULTS CAN BE ELIGIBLE FOR A PS THAT WILL BRING IT ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH OUR OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAM. AND ALSO PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR CASE MANAGEMENT AS YOU HEARD MISS RUTLEDGE DAY TYPICALLY OUR CASES ARE NOT QUITE OPEN AND SHUT BUT THEY ARE NOT A LONG TERM. CASE MANAGEMENT THIS WAS NOT SOMETHING THE PROGRAM HAD EVER BEEN FUNDED FOR. SO THE FUNDING THAT WE'RE PROPOSING WOULD HELP TO GO TOWARD THAT FOR THOSE NEEDIEST CASES THE ONES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEED. A LAST A MORE HANDS ON CASE MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN JUST MAKING REFERRALS TO SERVICES. AND THEN RELATIVELY QUICKLY CLOSING THE CASE FOR THAT BOB THAT. IN ADDITION THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH IS AIMED AT PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR APS. POPULATION WILL EXPIRE THIS JUNE. IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION AND WE'VE HAD SUCCESS AT ENSURING THAT OUR ELDERS AND DEPENDENT ADULTS DO NOT BECOME HOMELESS WITH THE PROGRAM. WHAT WE LEARNED- OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT OUR AGING POPULATION IN PARTICULAR IS THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION. AND THE VAST VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAD NEVER BEEN HOMELESS BEFORE SO THEY'RE ECONOMIC ISSUES THAT ARE CAUSING THEM TO BE HOMELESSNESS SO AT HOME STATE. DOES THAT COME TO OUR ATTENTION FOR APS WE'VE BEEN ABLE. TO HELP HER- REMAIN HOUSE. SO WE'D LIKE TO BILL OFF THE- SIX IN BOTH MAKE IT PERMANENT AND EXPAND IT TO ADDITIONAL. AND THEN- FINALLY HAD TO WE HAVE A PROPOSED ALSO NOTED ON LATER ON IN THE- FOR FUNDING. BUT WOULD YOU CAN. TO ALLOW AND BILL ON THE ELECTRON FORMS THE MISSION THAT- M. AS TOM. MENTIONED EARLIER THAT WE HAVE APPRECIATED DURING A PANDEMIC. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FORMS THAT BOTH ARE RECIPIENTS AS LAWS ARE PROVIDERS OF HIGH JUST THAT. NEED TO FILL OUT EITHER INITIALLY OR AT TIMES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND WE WERE QUESTIONED FUNDING ALONG WITH THAT- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. TO BE ABLE TO AUTOMATE THOSE FORMS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND ALLOW BOTH RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS JUST SUBMIT THOSE FORMS ELECTRONICALLY. WE THINK THAT'S REALLY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND EFFICIENCIES BUT ALSO AVOID UNNECESSARY FACE TO FACE INTERACTION. WHICH IS GOING TO CONTINUE WAITING TO BE A CONCERN FOR SOME TIME EVEN AS WE YEAH I'M INCREASE VACCINATION. WE SAW QUITE KNOW WHAT IS AROUND THE CORNER IT'S GONNA TAKE AWHILE TO GET BACK TO WHATEVER A NEW NORMAL LIVES AND SO TRYING TO BUILD OFF THE SUCCESS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE SHORTER TERM FLEXIBILITIES AND CONTINUAL. ADULT ON THIS ONE THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. WHAT'S THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AS THE PANELS COMPLETED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY. THE IF WE CAN TO- MISTER CLAY CAN. THANK YOU I THINK YOU'RE MUSICALLY AREA I AM EXCUSE ME FOR THAT. HAPPENS SO THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE GREATLY APPRECIATE IT- IN TERMS OF THE THREE QUESTIONS I HAVE THE FIRST ONE WAS COVERED QUITE WELL BY KIM A QUITE WAY I'M DIRECTOR WAY I DID A GREAT JOB DESCRIBING HOW TRIPLE A STEP IF IT'D IN PROVIDING SERVICES. ARE FAIRLY INTUITIVE THAT YOU KNOW SERVICES BECOME REMOTE RATHER THAN FACE TO FACE AND I SOMETIMES IT'S MORE EFFICIENT AND OTHER TIMES IT CREATES UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY AROUND ISSUES AROUND. SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT OR- LEGAL SERVICES OR- JUST OTHER WAYS WHERE THAT FACE TO FACE CONNECTION IS REALLY IMPORTANT I'M ONE THING THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE SHIFT TO ALL MEALS BEING HOME DELIVERED I CREATED SOME UNEXPECTED CHALLENGES BESIDES THE OBVIOUS ONES I'M ONE OF THEM WAS HOW DO YOU SERVE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE GOING TO CONGREGATE SITES TO RECEIVE THEIR MEALS. THEY HAVE NO HOME TO DELIVER THE MEALS TO SO- WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOME CREATIVE SOLUTIONS- CONTACTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS WAS PART OF THE TRICKY PART BUT YOU KNOW JUST FIGURING OUT A CENTRAL MEETING PLACE TO DROP OFF THE MEALS FOR THEM AND THEN ALSO CHANGING THE CONTENT OF THE MEALS TO BE SHELF STABLE. SO WE DID NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED REFRIGERATION- SO YOU KNOW THAT'S KIND OF AN EXAMPLE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT THE BIG SURPRISES I THINK WERE THE INCREASE IN DEMAND. OUR WE KNEW THERE WAS A LOT THERE BUT PROBABLY EVEN GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED AND I THINK THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT VULNERABLE SENIORS PREVIOUSLY VULNERABLE SENIORS BECAME MORE VULNERABLE THAN EVER SO THEY WERE KIND OF HIT EXPONENTIALLY HARD- THAT'S TRADITIONALLY THE HARDER TO REACH HER MORE ISOLATED INDIVIDUALS TO BEGIN WITH SO HOW DO WE STAY CONNECTED IN PROVIDE. SERVICES. ON SOME OF THE- IT ALSO IS. THE INFRASTRUCTURE OR LACK OF BATS. AND UNTIL THIS COMMITTEE STARTED TAKING THE LEAD AND ADDRESSING THE GAP IN SERVICES. SENIOR PROGRAMS WERE MOSTLY IGNORED ON BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL SINCE SWEAT NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE NINETEEN NINETY. SO WE HAD TWENTY FIVE THIRTY FIVE YEARS TO CATCH UP ON WHERE PROGRAMS WERE UNFORTUNATELY FOCUSING AS THEY SHOULD HAVE ON THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE AND MAINTENANCE OF IT. BUT NOT DOING REGULAR REPAIRS OR EXPANSION TO. INFRASTRUCTURE TO COLD STORAGE TO KITCHEN CAPABILITIES ARE VEHICLES WERE CONSTANTLY ARE EXCEEDING THEIR USEFUL. LIFESPAN ARE EXPECTED LIFESPAN SO WE HAD NOT ONLY THIS HUGE INCREASE IN DEMAND BUT ALSO A CRUMBLING SYSTEM BY WHICH TO PROVIDE IT. SO I THINK THAT IS- SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND HOPEFULLY MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. AND ARE SOME OF THE BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED TODAY ARE PART OF THE APPROACH OF RECOGNIZING THAT THIS POPULATION HAS GROWN. WAY FASTER THAN. WHO. GROUP. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GROWING OLDER. I'M SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO TO PREVENT THAT AND MOVE IT FORWARD ESTACION SEES LIKE REMOTE SERVICE THEM SIGNIFICANT ASKING YOU I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID A COUPLE MINUTES AGO BUT WE LOST YOU FOR MAYBE A MINUTE OR TWO. I'M SORRY SIR SO. I'M I WAS REALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON INFRASTRUCTURE. AND HOW FLAT FUNDING FOR SEVERAL DECADES. HAS LEFT US WITH CRUMBLING SERVICES SO WHEN AN INCREASED DEMAND COMES IF YOU DON'T HAVE UPDATED KITCHENS OR IF YOU HAVE OLD VEHICLES. THAT CREATES A CRISIS AND SERVICE DELIVERY AND I'M ASSUMING I'M COMING THROUGH OKAY NOW YES YOU ARE. RIGHT SO YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGE OF HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS WAS KIND OF. DOUBLED BY THIS NEW CHALLENGER G. WE HAVE TO SAY WE HAVE TO STORE TWICE AS MANY MEALS AS WE USED TO TWICE AS MUCH FRUIT THERE ISN'T CAPACITY DID YOU TO DOTHAT WERE HAVING TO RENT REFRIGERATORS RENT FREEZERS ON A SHORT TERM BASIS IT JUST MEANS THAT. AND THEN SHORTAGE OF JUST FOOD AVAILABILITY OR OTHER SUPPLIES HAS BEEN PART OF IT TOO. SO SOME OF THE YOU KNOW GREAT THINGS IS LEARNING HOW TO DO SERVICES IN A DIFFERENT MANNER AND MORE REMOTELY BUT WITH THAT COMES ITS OWN SET OF CHALLENGE- AGAIN THE ALREADY ISOLATED FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE HIT HARDER. BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE COMPUTERS OR TABLETS TO CONNECT WITH. AND EVEN ADVANCE PROVIDED THERE'S TWO OTHER PROBLEMS THAT FALL INTO THAT ONE IS AFFORDING YOUR MONTHLY INTERNET CONNECTION. TO IS IF YOU LIVE IN A WERE. IN A REMOTE AREA YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE% ACCESS TO STABLE INTERNET. I'M PERSONALLY I HAD TO GET A SATELLITE DISH CAPS STABLE INTERNET IN MY HOUSE LUCKILY I CAN AFFORD THAT. NOT EVERYBODY CAN. AND THEN THE THIRD PIECE OF THAT CONNECTIVITY IS JUST LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON HOW TO USE THE TECHNOLOGY. SO REALLY BRIDGING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS THREE PIECES IT'S NOT JUST. HAVING THE DEVICE BUT IT'S ALSO HAVING THE INTERNET CONNECTIVITY AVAILABLE AND HAVING IT AFFORDABLE. AND MAN PROBABLY MORE THAN THE OTHER TWO. AS KNOWING HOW TO USE IT. THE OTHER SURPRISE WE HAD AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN BUT IT WAS. AND THAT WAS THE IMPACT ON OUR WORK FORCE ESPECIALLY THE VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE SO MANY OLDER ADULT PROGRAMS ARE DRIVEN BY A CADRE OF VOLUNTEERS INCLUDING VOLUNTEERS PERFORMING AT THE PROFESSIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS DOING TAX ASSISTANCE WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS IN SINGLE SENIOR LEGAL PROGRAMS WE HAVE A VOLUNTEERS. ARE DOING NURSING HOME PROTECTION VOLUNTEERS EXPLAINING HOW MEDICARE WORKS SO THOSE ARE JUST CASUAL PEOPLE THAT CAN LEARN HOW TO DO THEIR JOB AND YOU KNOW HALF AN HOUR OF TRAINING IT'S EXTENSIVE ONGOING TRAINING AND THAT. IS A GREAT WAY FOR OLDER ADULTS THE STAND GATES WITH THE COMMUNITY BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE OLDER ADULTS ARE ALSO BEING TOLD ISOLATE WE NOW HAVE THIS VOLUNTEER CORE COMPONENT OF PROVIDING SERVICES. OUT OF THE PICTURE. INCREASED DEMAND LOSS OF WORK FORCE INCLUDING VOLUNTEER WORK FORCE SO THAT'S BEEN A HUGE CHALLENGE- IT'S ALSO A PLACE WHERE I THINK WE SHOULD PUT ADDITIONAL EMPHASIS IN THE COMING YEAR OR YEARS IS TRYING TO LEVERAGE THOSE VOLUNTEERS IN A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY AND MANNER. AND LOOKING AT THAT AS A COMPONENT FOR HOW ALL OF OUR SERVICES ARE STRUCTURED AND FORWARD. I'M TO KIND OF WRAP IT UP I THINK. THE PARTING COMMENT TO MAKE IS HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY WE CURRENTLY. FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND ADMINISTRATION ON AGING FEDERALLY OR ALLOWING THEM TO PROVIDE ENHANCED- BUT ALSO WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INCREDIBLE QUANTITY OF NEED THAT WE HAVE AND THEN IS THE SECOND PART OF THAT THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT MEET- SERVICES ARE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN EVER IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING. IN OUR ROLE- IS FAR BEYOND YOU KNOW JUST DETERMINING IF SOMEBODY'S ELIGIBLE ONES ACTUALLY FIGURING OUT HOW TO BEST PROVIDE SERVICES TO MEET NEEDS RATHER INTENDED TO MEET QUALIFICATIONS. I'M HOPEFUL THAT MASTER PLAN FOR AGING WILL SERVE AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN WHERE THE SHORTAGES ARE AND WHAT WE WANT TO GO IN THE DECADE SO HAPPY TO SEE. THAT COMING OUT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- I WANT TO MENTION AGAIN THAT THAT THIS IS SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN TACKLING THIS ISSUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW AND THAT IS ALSO EXTREMELY ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT THERE'S LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP IN TRYING TO GET THESE CRITICAL NEED SMITH. HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. ARE IF ANY HOUSE. YOU I THINK WE'LL MOVE O TO KELLY DETERMINANT AND WE WILL ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK DR PAMPERS LEADERSHIP ON THIS COMMITTEE AND REALLY TAKING THIS ISSUE TO HEART AND I CERTAINLY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS. HI MY NAME IS KELLY CHAIRMAN- GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY. I AM I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WHICH IS THE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES PROVIDE REGISTRY SERVICES TO ASSIST CONSUMERS TO FIND PROVIDERS PROVIDE TRAINING AND ARE THE EMPLOYER OF RECORD OF I. HSS PROVIDERS FOR PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. LAST MARCH WITHIN DAYS OF THE GOVERNOR SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER KAPPA PARTNERED WITH THE CONSUMER DISABILITY GROUPS UNIONS AND CW DA TRIDENTINE FIVE THE KEY CHANGES NEEDED TO KEEP PILOTS HAS US RUNNING. CDSS HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND AUTHORIZING PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL DURING THE PANDEMIC. PUBLIC AUTHORITIES ADMINISTERED THREE MAJOR HOPE IT CHANGES I HSS. ONE CDSS AUTHORIZED ENROLLMENT OF NEW PROVIDERS TO BE HANDLED REMOTELY PREVENTING A CRISIS AND ENSURING PROVIDERS GET PAID. PROVIDER MOMENT AN ORIENTATION IS STILL BY AND LARGE BEING HANDLED REMOTELY. AND AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD SINCE APRIL TWENTY TWENTY CDSS HAS PROVIDED MUCH NEEDED PP TO EVERY PUBLIC AUTHORITY FOR DISTRIBUTION TO HSS PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS. ALSO CDSS ISSUED THE MANDATE FOR COVERT EMERGENCY BACKUP SERVICES ON MARCH THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. COUNTIES DELEGATED THIS RESPONSIBILITY TO PUBLIC AUTHORITIES BECAUSE IT MADE SENSE TO TIE EMERGENCY BACK UP WITH A REGISTRY SYSTEMS. THROUGH HARD WORK AND GRIT EVERY PUBLIC AUTHORITY HAD AN EMERGENCY BACKUP SYSTEM IN PLACE WITHIN TWO WEEKS WHEREAS BEFORE CO BID MOST PUBLIC AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT. SAN FRANCISCO LA IN RIVERSIDE HAVE EMERGENCY BACKUP SYSTEMS BEFORE COUGHING. ALL WITH WAGE DIFFERENTIALS FOR THE HSS PROVIDERS. IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAD AN ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION WHEN FACED WITH THE PANDEMIC BY HAVING HAD AN EMERGENCY BACKUP PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT'S BEEN RUNNING FOR THE LAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS. THIS PROGRAM IS UNIQUELY STRUCTURED COMPARED TO A REGISTRY BACKUP PROGRAM AS THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC AUTHORITY COOLEY MANAGES THE PROGRAM FROM RECRUITMENT HIRING TRAINING COORDINATED SERVICE. FOLLOWING CARE PLANS AND TRIAGING ADDITIONAL SERVICE ME. AND SAN FRANCISCO THE PROGRAM IS USED A LOT HOWEVER THE UTILIZATION OF EMERGENCY BACK UP ACROSS THE STATE IS LOWER THAN EXPECTED. ANECDOTAL INFORMATION SUGGESTS THAT MANY CONSUMERS DO NOT WANT A STRANGER PROVIDING CARE AND THAT FAMILY OR FRIENDS HAVE FILLED IN. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NEEDED AND USE OUR EMERGENCY BACKUP SYSTEMS IT HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL AND SOMETIMES LIKE SICK. OUR MERCHANTS THE BACKUP SERVICES HAVE PREVENTED UNWANTED EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS. IN TERMS OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS POST COBIT WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S MASTER PLAN ON AGING WHICH RECOMMENDS INCREASING STABILITY R. I. HSS RECIPIENTS. THROUGH A BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM AND WE ARE DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS THIS GOAL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CONSUMER GROUPS UNIONS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY COUNTY SHOULD HAVE AN EMERGENCY BACKUP SYSTEM THAT IS ADMINISTERED BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY TO AUGMENT OUR RECORDS REGISTRY SERVICES. COURSE RECRUITMENT WILL BE A REALLY BIG FOCUS THERE HAS TO BE A WAGE DIFFERENTIAL AND PERHAPS A MILEAGE REIMBURSEMENT. IT MAKES SENSE TO DEVELOP A CONTINUAL APPROACH ADMINISTERED BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IN COORDINATION WITH COUNTIES WHERE CONTRACT AGENCIES COULD PROVIDE SERVICES IN SOME SITUATIONS. IT KEEPS CONSUMERS AT THE CENTER AND GIVES THEM A CONTINUUM OF CHOICE AND OPTIONS THAT BEST MEET THEIR NEEDS. I THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE INFORMATION ON WAYS THAT PUBLIC AUTHORITIES RESPONDED TO MAINTAIN IT HAS A SERVICES IN THE WAKE OF COBIT AND- LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- PROGRAM FINANCE ANYTHING. FILAYO ANYTHING ON THIS. OKAY JACQUELINE. CHAPLAIN BRAZIL AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND JUST A FEW THINGS THAT WE WENT TO ELEVATE THAT WAS DISCUSSED- WITH THE PANEL AND HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR AGENDA QUESTIONS IS THAT WE DO AGREE THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE MERITS OF KEEPING- PROGRAM BOOKS ABILITIES ARE CHANGES LIKE THE I JUST AS BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM- OR REMOTE TO SEE BASS AND K. COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES- AB THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE DURING COALBED THE MERITS OF CONTINUING THOSE AFTER KOPET AND WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES- ALSO AS DISCUSSED BY PANELISTS- WHILE THAT. THERE HAVE BEEN INCREASED SERVICE LEVELS DURING KOBE IT FOR MANY PROGRAMS AND THE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASSISTANCE HAS- AS FANS HOPE TO DRESS THOSE INCREASED FUNDING LEVELS OR INCREASED AS SERVICE NEEDS HOWEVER IT'S UNCLEAR TO US WHAT SHARE OF THE INCREASE SERVICE NEEDS- ARE TRULY TEMPORARY- VERSUS WHAT SHARE WILL ACTUALLY CONTINUE PAST COPING NINETEEN I'M SO TO BETTER ASSIST THE LEGISLATURE IN DETERMINING WHAT THOSE ONGOING FUTURE SERVICE LEVELS MAY LOOK LIKE AND THE LONG TERM EFFECTS COLD IT MAY HAVE ON THE STATE PROGRAMS- PERHAPS REQUESTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON- HOW. IS SERVICE LEVELS- WILL EITHER RANKED DOWN POST COLD VENT AND SO WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE NORMAL NEW STATE WILL BE LIKE- AND TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND COMPARED TO WHAT FUTURE FUNDING LEVELS WOULD LOOK LIKE ONCE THE TEMPORARY FUNDING FROM. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RAMPS DOWN. GRADIENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK I WOULD I WOULD IF WE COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THOSE QUESTIONS WHAT DO WE THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE ACROSS LIKE EVERYONE I HEARD FROM SAID THAT THEY WANT THE ELECTRONIC SIGNING UP. I'M SO MANY MORE VIRTUAL VISIT WHAT ELSE DO YOU THINK WILL WANT TO KEEP AND MAINTAIN- AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS HOPEFULLY BEHIND US. I GUESS IT'S BACK TO THE- BEIJING OUR DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES. SURE I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT- CHAIR THIS IS CHEMICALLY WAY TO THE DIRECTOR OF AGING IS THAT I DO THINK THERE IS I THINK ACTUALLY GOES BOTH WAYS BUT THERE'S A RECOGNITION- OF THE VALUE OF HYBRID SERVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE- IN ADULT DAY CARE WHERE A PERSON MAY BE RECEIVING TWO OR THREE DAYS OF IN CENTER FULL DAY SERVICE COULD THOSE OTHER TWO DAYS TO GET A VIRTUAL CHECK OR SOME OTHER CHECK AND OF COURSE IT COMES DOWN TO CANNOT BE A PAID SERVICE UNIT HOW YOU APPROPRIATELY TO. ENSURE QUALITY AND- EFFECTIVENESS BUT THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPAND BOTH THE AMOUNT OF SUPPORT TO AN INDIVIDUAL AS LIKELY COUNTS MENTION IT ALSO ALLOWS PERHAPS TO SERVE MORE PEOPLE IN THE SAME PHYSICAL CONSTRAINT RIGHT IF YOU'RE ON A GIVEN DAY YOU'RE BUILDING CAP MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE THAT MAYBE YOU'RE CALLING FIFTY MORE SO COULD BE A WAY TO- GROW SERVICES TO MORE PEOPLE AS WELL I THINK THAT'S- REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK ANOTHER THING THAT WE REALIZED- IS REALLY BEING CLEAR ABOUT THE DISSERVICE MIX SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE MEAL DELIVERY- PROGRAMS THE HOME DELIVERY. BUT IT'S MORE THAN A MALE BUT THERE'S A MEAL COMPONENT AND THERE'S ALSO A SOCIAL ISOLATION COMPONENT IN AND TALKING TO THE PERSON HAVING AN EYE TO EYE CONTACT CHECKING THE MAIL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ONLY HAPPEN WHEN YOU HAVE THAT THAT PERSONAL CONTACT OR HAPPENED DEEPER SHOULD SAY AND SO HOW DO WE VALUE ON BOTH THE MEAL AND THE ISOLATION CHECK THAT HAPPENS IN THAT PERSON CONTACT WE GIVE IT ITS FULL WORK. SO THOSE ARE TWO OF THE EXAMPLES FOR US AND I THINK YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THE TECHNOLOGY FOR VIRTUAL TO BE POSSIBLE IF YOU WERE DOING A VIRTUAL CHECK IN WITH THE CONSUMER THEN THEY NEED THE DEVICE BROADBAND AND THE SUPPORT TO MAKE THAT CONNECTIVE ITTY POSSIBLE I KNOW ALL OF US CAN RELATE TO THAT. SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PART OF IT TOO IS THE PERMISSION STRUCTURE IN THE PAYMENT FOR THE SERVICE BUT THEN THE ACTUAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER QUALITY VIRTUAL SERVICES IMPORTANT. TO BE ALLOWABLE PAIN AS WELL. THE YOU VERY MUCH. THE YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP. MICHAEL YEAH THANK YOU I LOVE TO BUILD THAT'LL- BIT AND THANK YOU FOR- THIS. TO FRESH THE INNER. HAS SOMETHING THAT ARM AND- HAVE BEEN NOTICE AS WELL. I WAS REMISS IN NOT MENTIONING IT EARLY. SO I'M REALLY GLAD DIRECTOR MCCOY WADE. IT ESPECIALLY IN OUR RURAL AREAS BUT ALSO IN A MORE POPULATED AREAS. THE INTERNET SERVICE CAN BE SKETCHY. AND BROADBAND- CAN BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IF YOU'RE IN A RURAL AREA. AND NOT THAT RELIABLE. AND SO WERE SUPPORTING EFFORTS TO TRY TO POINT. ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FINANCING IN THE PLACE OR JUST GETTING DOWN INTO THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND TO THEIR HOME. TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE INTERNET ACCESS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. SOMETHING OUR MEMBERS ARE DEFINITELY. SEEING A RECORDING ON AND ARE WORRIED ABOUT. AND HAVE SCHOOLS AND OTHER PLACES HAVE WE DONE HOT SPOT FOR PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY. THIS IS CAN'T WAIT AND I CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THE AUDIT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIC BROADBAND COUNCIL IS VERY MUCH TRYING TO TAKE IN ALL AGES LOOK AT THOSE COMMUNITY HOT SPOTS SO THAT THOSE SPOTS WOULD BE ABLE TO BENEFIT. BOTH CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS AND THE MAYBE THE COMMUNITY CENTER WERE OLDER ADULTS MIGHT BE ATTENDING. WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT A PLACE BASED OFFER THOSE KINDS OF HOT SPOT SOLUTIONS AND THAT IS PART OF. THE NEW STRATEGIC PLAN THAT THAT- BROADBAND COUNCIL RELEASED IN DECEMBER. AND AGAIN WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE OF BROADBAND REALLY BEING SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE TO THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE ACCESS AND- ALL THESE GREAT SERVICES THAT WERE ABLE TO DO ONLINE ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE DONE. FOR SO MANY. DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. ONE GREAT PLACE GOES AWAY THE- INCREASE IN THE DESERT AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USED TO GETTING. MEALS AT HOME AND MAYBE WEREN'T A PART OF- MEALS ON WHEELS OR OTHER SERVICES. ALL OF A SUDDEN% FLOCKING TO THE AGENCY AND HOW DO YOU. ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO. TAKE THAT IN. YES I SEE NOT I SEE NODS. I THINK EVERYONE ON THE PANEL IS NODDING I. STARTED IN MY COLLEAGUES CAN'T CAN SCAN CAN SPEAK TO IT YES WE DO- THAT GREAT PLACE WAS A TRAFFIC MODEL IN BRINGING MORE PEOPLE IN THE L. AT HOME HAVING THAT LOCAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS SUPPORTING RESTAURANTS IN THE WORK FORCE- AND SO. IT DID AS AS AS L. A. L. INDICATED BOTH HELP US MEET A TEMPORARY NEED OF MORE PEOPLE OR THE SAME PEOPLE WITH MORE MEALS- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO REACHED INTO SOME ONGOING NEED OR SOME NEW NEED FROM THE PANDEMIC THAT WILL CONTINUE TO SELL. ITS BOTH THE UNDERSTANDING THE POPULATION WHO WILL NEED A HOME DELIVERED MEAL BUT IS PERHAPS OUR HIGHEST TOUCH WE DO PROVIDE NUTRITION- AND THEN DOING THAT MATCHING WITH WHO NEEDS A HOME DELIVERED MEAL WHO MIGHT BE PROVIDED TO ME ALL- THE TRADITIONAL NEEDS THROUGH THE EXPANSION OF CALFRESH AND THEN ONLINE OFF OFFERS THEY'RE THERE NOW. I JUST ALSO PROVIDES AN ESSENTIAL MEAL SUPPORT AS WELL SO REALLY A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF ABOUT THE DOZEN DIFFERENT OLDER CALIFORNIA TUITION PROGRAMS- THAT HEALTHY TOGETHER TO MEET IS VERY DIVERSE POPULATION FROM SIXTY TO A HUNDRED FROM URBAN TO RURAL- IS ONE OF OUR PRIORITIES AND WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE TRIPLE AA IN VENTURA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF AGING BETWEEN JOB TO KIND OF HELP US WITH THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THE DIVERSITY OF NEEDS. AND THE DIVERSITY. OF PROGRAMS AND WHERE THE GAPS REMAIN. THEN WHAT ELSE ONE TO THAT I SEE. MISTER KEMPF. YEAH I JUST TO THE WEB DIRECT WAY JUST LAST- THE MOM PART OF THE SHOW. HOW SERVICES ARE IN I'VE ROLE COMMUTER VERSUS URBAN COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN IS A LOT OF RURAL COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE GREAT PLATES. THEY HAVE A NICE DINERS SO. I'M DEPENDS WHERE THEY LIVE. HERE'S HOW IT IT REALLY DOES SO THE POINT I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS AND PROVIDING SERVICE THAT THAT'S A REAL KEY P. SEVEN AND THAT HIS BACKEND WITH FLEXIBILITY ISSUE OF YOU KNOW WHAT NEW MODELS CAN WE CREATE A WEB MODELS HAVE. POPPED UP THAT WE ALL WANT TO USE AND TRY TO EXPAND ON I'M SO I JUST THINK IT'S YOU KNOW IT DOES KIND OF TOUCH ON INTERESTS ARE STRUCTURE ISSUE BUT IT'S ANOTHER REASON TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF FLEXIBILITY AND INNOVATION WHICH WERE ALL TRYING TO DO ALL THE TIME. AND I DO LIKE EUROPE FOCUS MISTER CAMP ON LOOKING FORWARD AND KNOWING THAT WE'VE GOT A CLIFF IN FRONT OF US IF WE DON'T. WE DON'T PUT SOME WORK INTO THIS. AND I THINK THE FINAL QUESTION I'LL ASK FOR WE TURN IT OVER TO. DR PAM FOR SOME QUESTIONS. IS ABOUT ABOUT VACCINATIONS RIGHT TO YOUR- BY DEFINITION SERVING PEOPLE WHO ARE IN. WITHIN THE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE VACCINATED. AND BY DEFINITION- WORKING WITH PEOPLE WHO. STRUGGLE WITH ISSUES AROUND EQUITY THAT WERE SO DESPERATELY TRYING TO. TO REACH. HOW HOW HAVE YOU DONE OR HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO TRACK. OF THE PENETRATION OF VACCINATIONS INTO THE POPULATIONS THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS IS AGAIN CAME AWAY TO DEPARTMENT OF AGING. SO I. JUST THAT IS OUR JOB NUMBER ONE RIGHT NOW ONE TWO AND THREE IS HELPING THE VACCINE SO WE BEGAN WITHOUT REACH BUT YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. BEYOND OUT REGION EDUCATION IN ADDRESSING ANY CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS IS THAT TRUE MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO REALLY CLOSE THAT LAST MILE. SO WE'VE BEEN VERY- ACTIVE WITH R. C. PH BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO EXPAND THE- THE POP UP CLINICS THAT GO WHERE PEOPLE ARE. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO- I COUNTIES LIKE SAMPOERNA DINO WHO HAVE DONE A VERY DEEP PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN AGING TO GO OUT TO WEAR OLDER ADULTS ARE. YOU'LL TELL ME HAS MADE SIMILAR EFFORTS WE ARE SHARING AMONG THE AGING NETWORK THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED PRACTICE COUNTY- EFFORTS TO GO OUT. WE'VE SEEN THIS ALSO WITH THE FEMA. SITES WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS GOING OUT AND DOING POP UP AND MOBILE CLINICS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE REALLY ALL YOU'RE SEEING THAT WITHTHE FACT DR RANDALL AND FORMER CLINICS AS WE SPEAK- AND WE'RE LOOKING TO AS WE MOVE TO THIS BROADER VACCINATION. NETWORK BLUE SHIELD. OUR NETWORK THIS IS MY- IS TO GROW GROW GROW GROW GROW. THOSE ARE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS FOR POP UP CLINICS WHERE PEOPLE ARE ON THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS WE NEED WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON OUR DATA WE'VE GOT. INCREASING DATA ON AGE AND DATA ON RACE AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GO. OF COURSE TO BE INTERSECTIONAL THE AGENT REYES DATA. SO THAT YOU CAN REALLY SEE WHERE THE GAPS ARE AND YOU'LL BE HEARING MORE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION ON EQUITY APPROACHES IN COMING DAYS- AS WE AGAIN IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS. EXPAND ELIGIBILITY TO ADULTS SIXTY FOUR AND YOUNGER WITH HIGH RISK MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR- DISABILITIES WHO ARE ALSO PART OF AGING DISABILITY NETWORK. RUSSIA DEPEND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- FOR SITES REALLY DO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE THE PART OF AGING AND PARTS OF SERVICES FOR YOUR HARD WORK- OFTENTIMES WHAT MAKES NEWS IS WHEN PROBLEMSHAPPENED SO I GUESS CONGRATULATIONS ARE NOT MAKING THE NEWS- AND ALSO OF COURSE ALL OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING HARD IN OUR- I. AGING AGENCIES AND OUR- SOCIAL SERVICES THE PARK COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS AND SO ON- I DO JUST WANNA JUST BRIEFLY MENTION I. REALLY APPRECIATE- MR TENTHS OF PRAISE FOR OUR PAST WORK THIS STATE SENATE'S ONLYHAS- PLAYED A LEADERSHIP ROLE ON AGING AND APPRECIATE THAT- I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT- EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT- THOSE PRO TEM ATKINS WHO MADE. AGING A PRIORITY WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR THEN BROUGHT IT UP IT IS STATE OF STATE ADDRESS LATER ON- BUT WE WERE WORKING A LITTLE BEFORE AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE. THE ALSO THANK THE BUDGET STAFF IN PARTICULAR WE NEED A PAUL WHO'S BEEN STAFFING THE AGING. ISSUES FOR ME AND HER HER PASSION AND MAKING SURE THINGS HAPPEN AS WELL SO. SHOULD THAT. REALLY DON'T REALLY HAVE MUCH QUESTIONS I THINK A LOT OF MAREADY COVERED- WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING- FURTHER UPDATES AS WE TRY TO GET OUT OF THIS- COATED- OPERATE CLOSELY THROUGH BOTH VACCINATIONS AND ALSO- THE- YOU KNOW THE OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES WHICH I. ALWAYS REMIND PEOPLE STILL NEED TO DO- AS WE'RE DOING VACCINATIONS AND- CERTAINLY- WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT MADE THEIR CANCERS YOU READY GIVEN ABOUT WHAT KIND OF THINGS WE WANT TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE THAT WE CAN LEARNFROM THIS EXPERIENCE WITH CODE. FOR ALL THE TERRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED WE'VE ALSO LEARNED SOME POSITIVE THINGS AND HOW WE CAN CONTINUE THIS FOR. NOW LOOK FORWARD ALSO TO ADDRESSING THE MASTER PLAN AGING LATER ON AND A GENDER SELF THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU DOCTOR OPINIONS- I THINK WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. OKAY NOW WE'RE ON. SPEAKING OF THE BUDGET INVESTMENT NOT TO SUPPORT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING. THE CAN BE YOUR DIRECT RECORD. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE EGGMAN AND US SENATOR PAN AS WELL IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN- AFTER EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF HAND IN HAND WORK ON THIS AS YOU SAY WITH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY AND THE MINISTRATIONS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS THREE QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA THAT ALL ADDRESS. THE FIRST ONE IS ABOUT THE BUDGET INVESTMENTS RELATING TO THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING VERY BRIEFLY THAT BUDGET- IN THE SUMMARY THERE'S A SECTION CALLED ADDRESSING AGING- AND IT WELL OUTLINES THE TWO APPROACHES THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TAKES TO- AGING AND DISABILITY AND CARE GIVING THE FIRST IS IN THE MAJOR INITIATIVES AGING IS LAYERED IN SO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INITIATIVES- SOME OF THE REDESIGN OF HOW A MEDICAID. AGING IS A THEME THROUGHOUT THOSE MULTI AGE INTERGENERATIONAL MAJOR INITIATIVES WITHOUT WEARING IN STRATEGY IS ONE THAT YOU I HOPE WE'RE HEARING IT MANY HEARINGS- BUT THERE ARE SEVEN TARGETED AGING INITIATIVES THAT ARE LISTED BUT I WANT TO BRIEFLY. RUN. THROUGH- IN. THE PAGES. OF THE FIRST IS ANNUAL THAT ONLY WAY OR TWO THAT ARE AFTER. OF AGING THEY ARE- I ACROSS DEPARTMENT AFTER IN THOSE THOSE WILL BE TAKEN UP AT THE APPROPRIATE HEARINGS- ARE THE FIRST IS THE OPPOSITE MEDICARE. INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICE RECOGNIZING CRITICAL MEDICARE IS FOR YOU CAN CALIFORNIANS. THE SECOND IS THE SOCIAL SERVICES UNDER DIRECTOR- JOHNSON THE PROPOSAL TO EXPAND FACILITIES TO SUPPORT HOUSING. THE THIRD- IN ANOTHER ITEM TODAY IS THE NO WRONG DOOR FOR AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. THE FOURTH IS AGAIN PART OF SOCIAL SERVICES I JUST AS BACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEM. THE FIFTH IT IS OUR INTENTION TO OUR- GERIATRIC CARE WORKFORCE INCREASING THE GERIATRIC CARE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF COST. THE SIX THAT IS AID PACKAGE AL-SADR'S PROPOSALS WHICH ARE- RANGING FROM RESEARCH TO PUBLIC EDUCATION TO TRAINING- AND MORE WHICH ARE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST THERE IS AN INVESTMENT IN THE CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AROUND AGING WITH BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE POSITION ON A SENIOR ADVISER ON AGING DISABILITY AND ALZHEIMER'S AND INVESTMENT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO FUND THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH LEADERSHIP ON A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. OKAY M. AS YOU AS IS THE AGENDA INDICATES THERE IS A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLACE HOLDER FOR THAT MASTER PLAN FOR AGING FUNDING AND THAT IS IN VERY ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT- WITH AGENCY AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION RIGHT NOW- ABOUT GIVEN THE PLANS FOCUS AND STRUCTURE HOW TO BEST- STRUCTURE THE IMPLEMENTATION TEAM AND THEY'LL BE MORE TO BE SHARED ON ADAM DISCUSSED ON THAT VERY VERY SOON. AND THE THIRD QUESTION ABOUT OUR CITY'S ROLE RELATED QUESTION- BOTH WITHIN C. HSS AND OUTSIDE OF IT TOO FOR THE MASTER PLAN. SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S MASTERPLAN. WAIT CLEARLY IN ITS EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM- TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE PLAN ITSELF IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE GOAL IS TO AND BAD AND ELEVATE AGING IN EVERY SINGLE COUNTY AGENCY IN DEPARTMENT AND YOU SEE THAT IN A CABINET WORK GROUP THAT FRANKLY BEGAN WITH I BELIEVE SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THE AGENCIES THAT BY THE TIME WE WERE DONE ALL TEN. WE'RE AT THE TABLE ALL TEN WANTED TO HAVE AGING- AS PART OF THEIR VISION AND MISSION ALREADY DID AND LOOKING TO DEEP AND DEEP IN THAT AND THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MASTER PLAN. MINISTRATION AGREEING TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO INITIATIVES IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS BUT ONE OF THE TEN AGENCIES AND SAID YES WE WILL DO THAT WE WILL PARTNER WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MOVE THAT WORK FORWARD. BUT WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE DA'S ROLLING NOW WE HAVE TWO ROLES ONE IS TO PARTNER PARTNERSHIP IS A CENTRAL ONE AGING FIELDS BUT US TO PARTNER WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR WORK. THEY ARE THE EXPERTS THEY ARE THE LEADERS IN THAT WORK AND HOW CAN WE SUPPORT THEM SO UST IN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS WE HAD MEETINGS WITH A CURRENT PUBLIC HELP ON THE ALZHEIMER'S STRATEGY. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON THE ELDER JUSTICE STRATEGY- BUT ALSO TE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD IN NAY ON A NEW SENIOR CHRISTIAN ISSUES AS WELL AS AGING FARMWORKER ISSUES- AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC ABOUT TARGETING A NEW ROUND OF GRANTS. TO A PER CORE AREAS PARTICULARLY SERVING PEOPLE OF ALL GENERATIONS ALL AGES AND HOW WE CAN FOSTER GENERATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS IN OUR PARKS. SO WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT AND PARTNER WITH ALL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES THAT'S ONE OF OUR CRITICAL ROLES AROUND AGING AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE IS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MASTER PLAN ITSELF. AND SO WE WILL BE DING VERY SIMILAR TO THE PLANNING PROCESS CONVENING A STAKEHOLDER GROUP WE HOPE TO ANNOUNCE THAT VERY SOON IN THE SPRING. ADAPT WITH MANY THINGS HAS BEEN A FINAL LITTLE BIT DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO FOCUS SO INTENTLY ON VACCINE ACCESS BUT IT IS STILL ON ON TRACK FOR SPRING. AND WE WILL BE RELEASING REGULAR PROGRESS REPORTS ON WHAT WE'VE DONE TRACKING BACK TO THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO INITIATIVES HOW ARE WE DOING. SO THOSE WILL BE PUBLIC AND TRANSPARENT SO PEOPLE CAN SEE. OUR PROGRESS IN PARTICIPATE IN THE AS- MEETING- AND OTHERS WILL HAPPEN- I WOULD. REALLY BUT AGAIN VACCINE HAS CHANGED THINGS AT LEAST THREE TIMES. YEAR I THEN WE WILL BE. FOR ANNUAL REPORT AT THE END OF THE- YEAR. REALLY RECOMMENDED. FOR WE GET RIGHT. WHAT WE NEED TO ADJUST AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD- AND THEN LASTLY IN TERMS OF THE KIICHIRO THE LEGISLATURE- AS YOU WELL KNOW DR PANDA BELIEVE- ARE IMMENSE TO DO AROUND TABLE IN THE MASTER PLAN WAS THE LAST IN PERSON EVENT I DID ANYWAY IT WAS. FIRST WEEK IN MARCH WITH YOU IN YOUR DISTRICT- SO- WE WERE VERY PLEASED TO WERE GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE MEMBER LEVEL HAVING A SERIES OF ROUNDTABLES. ON IN OUR OUR BUT AFTER THAT WAS A VIRTUAL WITH SOMETHING MEMBER JIM WOOD- BUT ALSO WITH THE STAFF WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE STAFF AND AFTER THAT THE COMMITTEES WHEN THERE WAS A LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT. OR RESEARCH COMMITTEE SO WE ARE VERY OPEN TO HAVE AS WE GO INTO IMPLEMENTATION HOW DO WE. INCLUDE BOTH MEMBERS AND STAFF. EARNERS IN IN WORKING ON THE AND I'M- HAPPY TO SAY THAT THIS FRIDAY WERE DOING A DEMO OF THE NEW DATA DASHBOARD FOR AGING. FOR LEGISLATIVE STAFF AS ONE WORK. WITHOUT THAT'S GREAT THE ONE QUESTION I WOULD TO DISCUSS THAT I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS ON THE WAY WHAT'S ARE WHAT YOU PLAN TO KEEP US UPDATED AS WE GO FORWARD. SURE WHAT AT A MINIMUM WE WILL BE DOING THESE REGULAR PROGRESS REPORTS I BELIEVE DURING THE PLANNING. BECAME UP ABOUT EVERY QUARTER WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF ON A MORE- AND BRING REGULAR BRIEFINGS. CONSULTATION WE'RE OPEN TO CO CREATING WITH THE FORMS ARE THAT ARE BEST FOR YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK THAT JUST THAT I AM I AM NEW TO THIS THIS PARTY- BUT WHEN I HEAR HUNDRED THIRTY TWO INITIATIVES AND I THINK EVERYTHING IS A PRIORITY IS ANYTHING REALLY A PRIORITY. THAT'S A LOT OF INITIATIVES. YES AND WE THINK AGING IS EVERYWHERE. IT'S ALMOST ANYTHING PEOPLE ARE WORKING ON WHETHER IT'S- CORRECTIONS OR AS I SAID PARKS. I SHOULD INCLUDE ALL OF ALL AGES AND SO THAT IS IT WHAT ONE WAY IT'S INTEGRATING AND HOPEFULLY CELEBRATING PARTICULARLY COMING OUT OF COBIT- HOW WEIRD IT IS TO ADDRESS THIS POPULATION IN EVERYTHING WE DO. I THINK YOU AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING FROM YOU. HELLO. YES THIS IS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN THE MASTER PLAN ON AN AGING REALLY IS KIND OF A ANOTHER PIECE TO THE PUZZLE AND WAY TOO MANY ORGANIZATIONS AND ENTITIES ARE PART OF PUTTING TOGETHER- AS WAS MENTIONED- THE LEGISLATURE WITH ITS PRIOR INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS I KNOW OUR OFFICE WE'VE DONE PROJECTIONS AROUND BOTH THE NUMBER OF SENIORS BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF SENIORS WITH DISABILITIES TO TRY TO INFORM- HOW SERVICE LEVELS FOR AND STATE PROGRAMS WE LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE- SO NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S MASTER PLAN- JUST SOME QUESTIONS WE WOULD RAISE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. IS ONE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ABOUT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT THE CHAIR ASKED IS WHAT DOES THAT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT LOOK LIKE AND HOW CAN THAT BE BUILT INTO THE ROLLOUT PROCESS FORMALLY ON ANY GIVEN THAT THE MASTER PLAN ISN'T ITERATIVE PROCESS- IN WHICH POTENTIALLY NEW INITIATIVES MAY BE ADDED IN THE FUTURE AS WE MAKE PROGRESS ARE COMPLETE AND THESE INITIAL INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED HOW WILL THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS BEING GAUGED AND THE EVOLUTION OF THE MASTER PLAN AND THOSE FUTURE ITERATIONS. I'M IN AND IN ADDITION ON THE CONCEPT OF PRIORITIES AND IF ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES WERE ADDED I'M MOVING FORWARD- HOW WILL THE LEGISLATURE INFORM THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS AND THE SELECTION OF THOSE. INITIATIVES- IT YEAH AND- A LEAVE MY CAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- AGAIN APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I KNOW THAT- ONE OF THINGS WE HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING- IS- NOW THAT THE MASTER PLAN IS OUT IS ACTUALLY HAVING A LEGISLATIVE HEARING ON THAT- AS CHAIR THE HEALTH COMMITTEE AND I DON'T KNOW THAT SOMETHING THAT- THE SUB COMMITTEE MAY ALSO WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND- MANY WAYS I WOULD ARGUE THAT AGAIN NOT AT LEAST FROM OUR SIDE ON THE DESCENT STATE SENATE SIDE. I RECALLS A COUPLE YEARS AGO- AND EVER HAD THIS AT A SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING JUST LIKE THIS ONE A CLOSE QUESTION TO THE PART OF AGING IN THE FINANCE AS TO WHAT IS THE- PROJECTED INCREASE BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES ALONE ON WHAT WE'D HAVE TO SPEND. ON SOCIALLY AGING SERVICES GOING FORWARD IF WE IN TERMS OF MAINTAINED CURRENT LEVEL SERVICE JUST BECAUSE OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES. SO IN FACT I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS SO WE HELD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND APPRECIATE- I THINK THE L. A. O. FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HEARING. AND A SICKLY THE BOTTOM LINE THAT IS VERY SHORT ANSWER IS THAT- 5% PER YEAR. 5% ANNUALLY IN PER YEAR NOW THAT'S OF COURSE ASSUMING WE DON'T MAKE YOU KNOW SERVICE REFORMS OR OTHER CHANGES ETCETERA BUT IN ORDER TO JUST MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS THE WAY THEY- THEY THEY WORK. WE KEPT EVERYTHING THE SAME JUST WITH DEMOGRAPHICS LOAN WAS 5% A YEAR NOW. KEEP IN MIND OUR GDP DOESN'T GROW 5% A YEAR ARE POPULOUS YOU KNOW OUR TAX BASE DOESN'T GROW 5% A YEAR. AND SO THAT OF COURSE IS THE BUDGET CHALLENGE RIGHT I MEAN THERE'S OBVIOUSLY HUMAN CHALLENGES WELL IN TERMS OF BEING SURELY. PROVIDE THE HELP WE NEED TO THE SENIORS TO LIVE IN THE STATE BUT I MEAN JUST EVEN FROM A STRICTLY BUDGET STANDPOINT. AND I'M ALWAYS CURIOUS EVERY TIME THE BUDGET COMES OUT AS ARE WE KEEPING UP WITH 5% A YEAR FOR HE SERVICES- THINGS LIKE I. HSS AND- NURSING HOME CARE AND- YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES OF SENIOR PROGRAM C. BASSETT CENTER- AND SO FORTH. SO- SO GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS- I. FELT LIKE I DO HAVE. IS THAT AND- IS THAT IN TERMS OF. THE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT- THAT'S- APPS ON THE IN TERMS OF PARTICULAR BUDGET STANDPOINT ONE THE MORE EXPENSIVE THINGS IS YOU KNOW THE PAYMENT FOR LTSS SERVICES MARKET LEADER TALK ABOUT HSS IN THIS HEARING. AND OFTENTIMES PEOPLE- IT WAS A COMPLAINTS NOT RIGHT WORD BUT THEY- EXPRESSED-CONCERN ABOUT HOW QUICKLY I HSS SPENDING GOES UP BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE DEMOGRAPHICS ACTUALLY IT'S NOT COMING UP VERY FAST IN RELATION TO THE DEMOGRAPHICS. AND SO- AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE WHEN WE HEAR THE PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES. YOU KNOW I IN TERMS OF AGAIN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM A GOOD CHUNK OF SPENDING ON MEDICARE ALL IT ACTUALLY GOES TO AGAIN- NO INSTITUTIONAL CARE. RIGHT SO- YEAH WHEN THINGS WERE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE THE MASTER PLAN GOT STARTED AND- WOULD BE INTERESTED IS THE QUESTION- THE ANSWER TO THIS SO WE'VE BEEN EXPLORING THIS IDEA OF SAYING THAT. WE NEED TO. FIND A WAY TO FINANCE LONG TERM SERVICES SUPPORTS NOT JUST THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM SO BASICALLY THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT. YOUR FAMILY YOU BASICALLY SPEND DOWN UNTIL YOU CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID THEN YOU END UP ON MEDICAID AND THEN YOU GET YOUR- SERVICES THAT WAY. THAT THERE'S GOT TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE THAT PARTICULAR FROM MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. AND- SO IN RELATION TO THE MASTER PLAN- AND SO FORTH THAT THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE MASTER PLAN AND IF SO. WHERE DOES THAT SAID SO I KNOW THAT THERE'S PIECES AND ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT PARTS AND WE HEARD FROM THE FAR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WE'VE HEARD SOME THINGS FROM SOCIAL SERVICE AND WE HEAR SOME MORE LATER THIS HEARING. AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS- SO I DON'T KNOW FOR DEPARTMENT AGING IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL UNDER DEPARTMENT AGING TO DO THIS KIND OF ACTUARIAL STUDY OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. FALLS UNDER DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT AND IS THERE A CHANCE IN THIS- EVADING DOESN'T KNOW PERHAPS FINANCE CAN ALSO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION AS WELL SO- BECAUSE I THINK THIS DEFINITELY AS A BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE. THAT'S THAT THAT WOULD HAVE A POTENTIALLY VERY INTACT ON HER. BUT GOING IN THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE ABLE TO ACT SUCCESSFUL DO THIS. GREAT LET ME TRY TO PROVIDE ONE ANSWER TO IT AND THEN I WILL TURN MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES TO ASSIST SO- AGAIN. PERMITTING SUCH A KIND OF I MEAN I THINK YOU'RE ASKING BOTH A SYSTEM QUESTION AND TO PAY YOUR QUESTION WHICH IS YES IT MORE I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO ANSWERS. THAT WOULD YOU THINK. I MEAN YOU KNOW YOU YOU ARE CORRECT THE LONG TERM SAYS LONG. TERM SYSTEM. ACER THAT P. THAT WE AS WE- IS. BY MY- PAIRS MEDICAID MEDICARE OTHERS PRIVATELY BANKS MEDICARE NOT SO MUCH BUT THAT'S A LITTLE BIT YES. IN MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT MANY OF OUR APARTMENTS. SERVICES AGING SO YOU'RE RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS- THE MASTER PLAN DID BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROSS PROGRAM DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE THAT SYSTEM TABLE. AT THE LTSS SUB COMMITTEE AND WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CONTINUE THAT SYSTEM TABLE- PARTICULARLY PERHAPS BUILDING ON THE STRONG FOUNDATION OF THE OLMSTED ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT BRINGS TOGETHER DISABILITY AND AGING STAKEHOLDERS TO LOOK AT COMMUNITY INCLUSION- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM CONVERSATION. AND CERTAINLY AGING IS PART OF FACILITATING THAT PARTNERSHIP CONVERSATION. BY TIER ABSOLUTE POINT MEDICAID AS A DH CS DHS CONTINUES TO BE THE LEAD ON THAT ISSUE AND DELETE THE WORK WORK WITH MELANIN TO DO THE ACTUARIAL STUDY- THE NEW MEDICARE OFFICE OF INNOVATION INTEGRATION IS PROPOSED TO BE AT DH. CS BECAUSE THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY. BOTH MEDICARE. THAT EXIST NOW. TO EXPAND MEDICARE'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES. AND POTENTIALLY SOME EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION. TO REVISIT MEDICARE'S ROLE LTSS I AND THEN TO YOUR POINT THERE IS BEYOND. THE STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS RECONVENING A LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE COMMISSION FOR ANOTHER PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. THERE ARE I DO YES YES IT'S CLEARLY AT THE HEART OF THIS- BUT WE ARE AND ALSO WE ARE TRYING TO. HAVE A SYSTEMS TABLE CONVERSATION AS WELL WELCOME YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN ADVICE ON THAT AND RECOGNIZE YOUR LEGISLATION IN THAT AREA AS WELL YEAH. WELL AND IF IT'S APPRECIATE THE ANSWER- IN SOME WAYS- WELL CERTAINLY- DCS THOSE HAVE ALWAYS THE EXPERTISE AND HEALTH CARE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AND IN PAIN AND SO FORTH. THIS ISN'T YEAH WE'RE NOT ALKING ABOUT. THAT WELL WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SIMPLY THE PART THAT FITS IN MEDIC CAL OR EVEN THE PART THAT FITS AND MEDICARE ALTHOUGH DEPENDS AGAIN ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL IT CREATES NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR MATCHING FUNDS IT'S EVERYONE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. SO BUT JUST STUDYING THE ISSUE OVER ALL BEYOND META CAL RIGHT SO WE HAVE MEDICARE WE KNOW THAT'S THERE BUT FOR PEOPLE. IS THERE AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO NOT HAVE TO GO ON MEDICARE HOUSE IN ORDER TO GET LTSS SERVICES AND WHAT ARE THEY SO YES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS LOOKING AT- YOU KNOW PRIVATE. THAT THE PRIVATE- ISHMAEL HAVE LONG TERM CARE CERTAINLY L. A. SURE IT'S ADDRESS- I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT FOR EXAMPLE AND OF COURSE THAT'S PLAYED BY THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE ADVERSE SELECTION OF NEARLY NOT EVERYONE'S IN AND SO FORTH. IS THERE. A SPACE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUE AND MAYBE IT IS IN YOUR TELL ME ITS DTS THAT'S FINE ENOUGH TO INTEREST HERE FROM DIED. FROM FINANCE. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE A FIGURE OUT A CONVERSATION ABOUT SAYING LOOK HOW COULD WE- HOW COULD BE. WE HAVE TO SEVEN YOU PROGRAM. RIGHT DAD WHERE EVERYONE HAS TO BE AND IN THE SAME WAY WE ACTUALLY SET UP THE RETIREMENT PROGRAM ACTUALLY THERE TIME SEEMS PROGRAM HERE AS WELL- THAT. THAT WAS DONE THAT THAT MAY BE. PART OF THE SOLUTION SO. WHERE WOULD THAT SIX. OUT IN TERMS OF- WOULD THAT STILL CERTAIN EIGHT C. S. A. SIM IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT'S QUITE AN AGING- MAYBE FINANCING THOMAS TO WHERE'D THAT DISCUSSION SHOULD SET. YEAH I DO THINK IT'S A PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE THE HEALTHCARE PAYER IT IS A GAP IN MEDICARE IT'S ULTIMATELY GAPPING MEDICARE IN OUR COUNTRY AND SO THAT IS A STARTING PLACE BUT INTO THE- YOUR PERSPECTIVE. YOU'RE CORRECT THAT WE- SERVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE- WHO ARE IN THAT EXACT DILEMMA YOU DESCRIBE TO CANNOT AFFORD IT WHO ARE SPENDING DOWN AND SO WE ARE ALSO. SEEKING TO PARTNER WITH OUR DH CS LEADSAND I WITHOUT A HAND IT TO FINANCE TO FURTHER ADDRESS THIS. IS A QUESTION OF HOW DO WE FINANCE AND FIND OUT LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. DEPARTING FINANCE. BOB GOOD AFTERNOON ALFA MIKE HARTMAN FINANCE- WE I CO DIRECTOR MACQUARIE FOR WEIGHTS OFF STATEMENTS AND THE LATEST VERSION OF THE PROPOSAL OUT OF THE OFFICE OF MEDICARE INNOVATION IMMIGRATION ACT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES- AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS OFFICE. WOULD BE BROADER THAN JUST- BUT IF CALCULATION IT WOULDN'T BE FOR. OLDER WERE JUST ODD MEDICARE. OKAY AND. WORKING ON STRATEGIES INCENTIVE ALL ON HOW TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LONG TERM AND SUPPORTS FOR POPULAR SIZES THAT'S MORE SO QUESTION IS- FUNDING ASIDE TO THAT I. AND THEY THAT **** SHOULD TALK TO WE TALKED DETAILS BUT IS THERE FUNDING ASSIGNED THE OFFICE TO DO THE ACT OR- NECESSARY. TO AND IF TO HELP START DEVELOPING AIDS. TO PROVIDE. THE FINANCE LTSS SERVICE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT COOL HOPEFULLY NOT COULD END UP IN THE ATTIC CAL I MEAN WE CAN FORCE THEM INTO EVENTUALLY IF THEY SPEND DOWN ENOUGH. BUT THAT. BUT BASICALLY LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVES. TO SPENDING DOWN TO MALAKAL IS A WAY TO FINANCE AND AFTER ALL OF WE THE PEOPLE DO SPEND ON AMERICA WE'RE STILL PAYING FOR AS TAXPAYERS RIGHT WE PAY OUR HALF OF THE STATE SO. I THINK THERE'S AN ADVANCED US TO DOING ITS ONLY BE SURE WE ACTUALLY PUT IN MONEY INTO THE BUDGET TO LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND TO DO THE KIND OF ACTUARIAL WORK NECESSARY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. HOW TO FIND OR SELL OUT OF BASICALLY. COME UP SOLUTIONS AT THE LLAMA. I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A DHD ASK QUESTIONS GIVEN THAT THEY HAVE THE CONTRACT ON THE CURRENT ACTUARIAL STUDY. WITH NORMAN THAT'S COME OUT THIS PAST SUMMER- THAT DID PUT. SOME ASSUMPTIONS AND SOME ESTIMATES AND SOME PRICES ON VARIOUS WAYS TO DO SOMETHING CALIFORNIA SIMILAR TO WASHINGTON STATE DID. SO I DO WITHOUT YOU KNOW WITH ALL RESPECT BUT THEY COMMITTEE AND MY CALL TO DH YES BELIEVE IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT. OKAY BUT ONCE WE THAT'S L. A. A. REALIZING IT MAY NOT BE USED TO THAT TO EVERY CAN RELAY THAT INFORMATION TO THE PROPER PERSON OVER. FINANCE. HER DHS- I WOULD LIKE TO BE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY. BUDGETING DOING STUDY THAT'S A VERY SMALL DOWN PAYMENT. FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL DEFINITELY WELL WE'RE PROBABLY LOOKING AT A RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF. HOW WE'RE GONNA FINANCE LTSS- IN THE VERY IT BOTH THE NEAR AND DISTANT FUTURE. YES FINANCING PERMITTED AGING CAN BRING THAT BACK TO DH CS. OKAY I THANK YOU AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN ANSWER THAT OKAY THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT THAT ANSWER- IF WE CAN MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS. YES I DO WAY TO GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING I'M DELIGHTED TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL. AS YOU HAVE BEEN HEARING AND IS YOU KNOW AND IT'S ACTUALLY DIRECTOR JOHNSON REALLY BEAUTIFULLY- PRESENTED THERE IS QUITE A SPECTRUM OF SERVICES- QUITE A SPECTRUM OF US SUPPORTS AND NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS IN COUNTY PROGRAMS AND HEALTH PLANS AND HOUSING. WHAT IS CHALLENGING FOR THE PUBLIC IS FINDING HOW TO ACCESS THEM AND SO WHAT THIS PROPOSAL DOES THIS CROSS SUGGEST. A UNIFIED FRONT DOOR. THAT WOULD CONNECT YOU WITH SOMEONE IN YOUR COMMUNITY WITH THE EXPERTISE AND TRAINING TO HELP YOU NAVIGATE. THAT THAT MAYES AND FIND THE RIGHT MIX OF SERVICES FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SO THIS IS ODD. FEDERALLY KNOWN AS THE AGING DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTION ADRC OFTEN IN CALIFORNIA WE CALL IT N RUN DOOR- THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROPOSAL TO- REALLY THINK ABOUT AS WE MOVE TO A STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND PROPOSED DOING THAT- THREE LOOK AT BANNING AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT'S A NAME THAT RESONATES WITH OLDER ADULTS. AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND CARE GIVERS AND IS RECOGNIZABLE- I OFTEN JOKE THAT I'M JEALOUS OF THE FIRST FIVE BRAND THAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WITH YOUNG CHILDREN WE NEED TO FIND THAT OUT FOR OUR POPULATION SO THE NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE YOU KNOW WHO TO CALL. AND AGAIN IT'S THAT FRONT DOOR IT'S COMMON ACROSS THE STATE BUT IT IT CONNECTS TO YOUR LOCAL. AGENTS ON AGING AND IN THE- LIVING SO THAT IS THE EXPERT. IN BOTH PERSON CENTERED CARE HE'D- SERVICES. I IN YOUR COMMUNITY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL HELP US TO GET STATEWIDE- WE CURRENTLY. IF YOU COUNT BOTH OF OUR ESTABLISHED FULL SERVICE AT OUR SEAS AND ARE EMERGING PARTIAL SERVICE IN YOUR SEATS. WE ARE HAVE A PRESENCE IN ABOUT A THIRD OF THE STATE. SO THIS PROPOSAL WOULD HELP US GET BASELINE FUNDING. THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND BEGIN TO BE THAT BAD THAT FRONT DOOR. FOR PEOPLE STATEWIDE AND THAT THAT THAT FULL SERVICES BEYOND JUST INFO AND REFERRAL BUT TRULY COUNSELING TRULY. NAVIGATION AN ENROLLMENT ASSISTANCE. I WILL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUNDING THAT CAME IN TWENTY NINETEEN- VERY ESSENTIAL TO HAVE THAT STATE SUPPORT WE'RE ALSO PLEASED WITH THE PANDEMIC ON THE THAT WE ALSO HAVE THREE MILLION MORE IN FEDERAL FUNDING SO THAT INFUSION OF THAT. FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP WITH EIGHT MILLION- IS HELPING US EXPAND SERVICES AS THEY THEY ROSE IN THE PANDEMIC I WILL SAY ALSO THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT- WE'VE ALL BEEN IN CRISIS RESPONSE MODE SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO MOVE SOME OF THE PLANNING. FOR WORK SO WHILE THE SERVICE A MAN WENT UP AND WE AND WE CONTINUE TO MEET THE SERVICE DEMANDS. AND THE WAY THAT WE WERE WE ARE ALSO STILL MOVING TO EXPAND THAT THE RANGE OF SERVICES IF I CAN. I CAN SAY THAT. I'M LOOKING AHEAD. JUST AS WE ARE THINKING A LOT ABOUT THE PUBLIC- ACCESS POINTS AND THE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES BEHIND IT WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THE FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND HOW DO YOU FIND- THIS PROGRAM AS A FRONT DOOR. LIKE I SAID TO SOCIAL SERVICES HEALTH SERVICES HEALTH PLAN SERVICES COMMUNITY SERVICES AND MORE. I WILL BE LOOKING AT- OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS FOR CONSUMING OLDER AMERICANS ACT OPPORTUNITIES WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING MEDICAID ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMING WITH T. H. C. S. A MODEL THAT'S USED IN- SEVERAL OTHER STATES. WILL BE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THE SUSTAINABLE FINANCIAL PLAN TO SUPPORT THE EMERGING. AND GROWING STATEWIDE NETWORK. THAT'S A VERY BRIEF I'M HAPPY TO STOP GIVEN TO. AND I. OUGHT TO GET A QUOTE YOU MAY. M. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. HELLO HELLO YES WE WOULD LIKE THAT CURRENTLY THE ADRC FUNDING IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL SUSPENSION ON DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINDS THAT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH REVENUES TO COVER ALL SUSPENSION ITEMS- IN THE MAY REVISION- AND JUST BASED OFF OF CURRENT LAW LOOKING AT ACTUAL REVENUE LEVELS IT'S LIKELY THAT- IF THIS CALCULATION WERE CONDUCTED IN MAY AND THERE WOULD BE ENOUGH REVENUE TO- COVER ALL SUSPENSION ITEMS MEANING THAT THE FUNDING FOR A YEAR SEIZE WOULD CONTINUE PERMANENTLY HOWEVER UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT BUDGET- THEY ARE PROPOSING TO SUBJECT AB OR SEE FUNDING AND OTHER ITEMS AND THE EXISTING SUSPENSION ITEMS. TO NEW SUSPENSION LANGUAGE WHICH ESSENTIALLY WOULD PUSH OUT THIS CALCULATION TO MAY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND- AND THEN ALSO PUSH OUT THE POSSIBLE SUSPENSION DATE TO DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WHILE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THEM DETER C. FUNDING REQUEST- IN A PRIOR RIGHT UP WE DID RECOMMEND OVERALL REJECTING THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE- AS IT IN PART I'M PREEMPTIVELY REDUCES OR ELIMINATES FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS WHICH THEN IT HINDERS THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO WEIGH THE BENEFITS AND TRADE OFFS OF ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS WHEN CONSIDERING HOW TO MANAGE- THE PROJECTED BUDGET SHORTFALL. ON IN ADDITION A IN IN ADDITION TO OUR RECOMMENDATION OF REJECTING THE NEW BUDGET BILLS SUSPENSION LANGUAGE- WE ALSO- WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON ONE- THE CREATORS THE SERVICE LEVELS- HOW THE RECENT STATE FUNDS HAVE IMPROVED ACCESS I'M AND SEVEN SERVICE LEVELS ACROSS THE STATE AND HOW ANY FUTURE REDUCTIONS TO OR ELIMINATION OF STATE FUNDING TO EACH YEAR SEES- COULD IMPACT ACT. THE EIGHT YEARS HE NETWORK AND POSSIBLY COME RESYNC THAT WE MADE A NEXT. ON THE NETWORK WITHIN THE STATE. THANK YOU. FOR THE LETTER AT ENFORCEABLE AGREE WITH WHAT THE L. A. ASSIGNMENT MONEY JUST BECAUSE THIS QUESTION AGING- IF FOR GOD FORBID- IT WAS STRANDED- WELL THIS IS LIKE- HOW DOES THIS PROGRAM- POTENTIALLY EITHER MAY ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY BECAUSE WE GET PEOPLE SERVICES OR IMPROVES ACCESS- TO FOR SENIORS SO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE. THE THE A PROPOSAL FOR THE AIR SEAS IS IT IS IT IS IT HELPFUL. THE HELP PEOPLE. WELL BASED ON ALL OF OUR EXPERIENCES- BEFORE THE PANDEMIC BUT EVEN MORE RECENTLY GETTING INFORMATION. NO OLDER ADULTS ABOUT. BEING HOME ABOUT MEALS ABOUT TESTING ABOUT VACCINATIONS ABOUT EVERYTHING WE NEED TO STAY IN OUR HOME COMMUNITIES AND A BUT AS YOU SAY AVOID THAT HEALTH CRISIS. AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION AVOID THAT SUICIDE ATTEMPT. THESE ARE- THE VERY VERY VALUABLE NAVIGATOR SERVICES BOTH IN TERMS OF- THE COMPLEXITY OF SERVICE IS BEING PROVIDED TO HELP SOMEONE PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE OF CARE COORDINATION THAT REALLY WORKS FOR THEM AND THEIR NEEDS MAY CHANGE- AND ALSO- V. THAT- OLDER ADULTS THEMSELVES MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD. SOMEONE ELSE WHO CAN HELP THEM REDUCE MORE MORE LIVING ALONE- MORE AND MORE MAY HAVE A CHALLENGES TO BE AS WE AGE AT HOME SO AND THEN TO THE THIRD WITH THAT YOU MADE THE COST OF THE ALTERNATIVE- THE COSTUME OF THE NURSING HOME OR ASSISTED LIVING YEAH A WELL IN THE CENTRAL PART OF A CONTINUUM OF CARE IS CAN BE ONE OF THE MOST. EXPENSIVE SO THE MORE WE CAN DO TO. HELP PEOPLE BE AWARE OF THEM FIND THEM AND ACCESS THEM WE THINK THEY THAT IT PAYS OFF IN EVERY WAY AND WE AND WE ACTUALLY ALSO THINK IT'S A MATTER OF EQUITY. THAT'D BE CLEAR WHAT'S AVAILABLE AND THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE WAYS TO ACCESS THAT THAT IT NOT BE AMAZED TO FIND IN THE SERVICES MY COMMUNITY- SO BRINGING IT TO PEOPLE AN ACCEPTABLE LANGUAGE FRIENDLY AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT WAYS AND- VERY INSPIRED BY THE MODEL IN SAN FRANCISCO WHERE I DIDN'T SPEAK TO HAVE KELLY HERE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WITH HER EXPERTISE. WHERE THERE IS A CENTRAL TRIPLE A BUT THEY ALSO HAVE THIRTEEN COMMUNITY PARTNERS RECORD- HOUSE AND SPOKE. OUT TO THE DIFFERENT CULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN Q. INCLUDING LGBTQ I THINK ALLOWS US TO REALLY BE THAT BEST OF BOTH WORLDS THAT COMMON FRONT DOOR FOR EASIER ACCESS BUT THEN ALSO THAT TAILORED LOCAL ASSISTANCE FOR THAT MEANS THAT PERSON'S NEEDS WHERE THEY ARE THAT PERSON CENTERED BOB EQUITIES LED APPROACH SO- YES. WE ARE VERY INSPIRED BY WHAT WE SEE IN WASHINGTON STATE AND OTHER PLACES AROUND THE COUNTRY- GETTING LOTS OF OFFERS OF HELP FROM OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO HELP CALIFORNIA TAKE THE BIG LEAP FORWARD. I THINK WE KNOW WHAT IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. INDEPENDENT AND WE- THAT WITH SUPPORT WE CAN. ON A DIFFERENCE BY FORWARD OKAY NO I APPRECIATE- FINANCES YOU HEARD THAT ANSWER. BECAUSE OF- I'M NOT GONNA ASK DIRECTOR IN THEM OF. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THEREFORE CANNOT DISAGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BUT FOR ALL THE REASONS WHICH I ALSO FIRMLY AGREE WITH THE- THE DIRECTOR THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY VERY BENEFICIAL IT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY. TO ME IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THEN TO PUT ON. A SUSPENSION. WHERE YES YOU KNOW I IT'S NT CERTAINLY A WIN BUT IF- IF THE ECONOMY ACTUALLY WIN WOULD ARGUE THAT A PROGRAM THAT PROTESTERS BENEFITS- DESCRIBED AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS. WOULD BE ONE WOULD WANT TO RETAIN. EVEN IF THE ECONOMY WAS DOWN. WITH WITH WITH THAT WAS THAT IT WOULD BE THAT IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD DISAGREE WITH. FINANCE WHERE KNOWLEDGE BURKE CONCERNS ALL BARBARA BY THE LEGISLATURE MLA- AND WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ADRC PROGRAM- BUT AS SOMETHING WILL KEEPING THIS VERY STRONG. AS FOR OF THE OVERALL JUST ONCE HE'S BACK IT'S AN OVERALL- ST STE THIS FOCUS ON. OKAY. HE AT RICHARD AT AT THEN A REAL THAT- DISMAY MESSAGE RELY TO FAR UP THE CHAIN- BUT YOU KNOW WHEN THE THAT I WAS OF THE SENATE OFTEN. ABOUT IS THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT- WE SAY SOMETHING COSTS X. AMOUNT OF DOLLARS RIGHT IN THE BUDGET WITH THE SAY WELL HOW MUCH IS THE COST WE DON'T DO THAT. RIGHT SO HOW MUCH IS THE BECAUSE THAT'S IT'S NOT SO MUCH DO WE SPEND MONEY ON THIS. WE JUST DON'T SPEND MONEY SO THEREFORE WE STE YOU KNOW I HAVE A NUMBER OF. POSITIONS OR WHATEVER ELSE AND THAT'S GONNA BE THAT MANY DOLLARS. BUT HOW MUCH WE SPEND WE DIDN'T HAVE IT. RIGHT AND- AND SO IT TURNS OUT WE'RE GONNA END UP SPENDING MORE FROM NOT HAVING IT. THEN FROM HAVING IT. I'M NOT SURE WHERE WE WOULD PUT IT ON A SUSPENSION LIST OR SOME OTHER SITUATION I MEAN. THAT THAT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE A GOOD INVESTMENT. AND SO I HOPE THE ADMINISTRATION I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE L. L. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE DIRECTOR OF AGING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM. AND ALSO IT'S EVEN FINANCIAL BENEFITS SO I HOPE THAT CERTAINLY- WHEN IT COMES TO. SUSPENSION LANGUAGE WE CAN ALL AGREE MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST ELIMINATE THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE BECAUSE WHY WOULD WE WANT TO SUSPEND A PROGRAM THAT NOT ONLY HAS THIS TREMENDOUS BENEFITS AS WAS DESCRIBED I WON'T REPEAT ALL OF THEM. BUT ALSO PROBABLY. AND THEN OF COURSE WE CAN TO MAKE IT MORE ANALYSIS OF THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON THAT. THEY ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY. SO WITH THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR PAN AYE I CALLED THE BLUE TARP SYNDROME EVEN AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOU SEE THOSE HOUSES WITH THE BLUE TARP ON THE ROOF AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS A HOLE IN IT DIDN'T GET PATCHED AND THEN PRETTY SOON THE RAIN CAME IN THAT WHOLE GOT BIGGER AND THEN THE ROOF CAVED IN AND THEN HAVE FLOODING IN A LOT MORE PROBLEMS- SO WE CAN ALL AGREE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO KEEP THE ROOF.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ADULT PROGRAMS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS DEBBIE THOMPSON WITH THAT FROM THE SOCIAL SERVICES ADULT PROGRAMS AND I CAN RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE. WERE IN THE- AGENDA THE FIRST ONE BEING A PLEASE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CASE THAT IN FUNDING LEVELS FOR THE I JUST LAST PROGRAM. SO THE CURRENT YEAR- FUNDING FOR THE I JUST AS PROGRAM TOTAL FUNDS WAS FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. EIGHT MILLION FEDERAL FIVE POINT ONE STATE AND ONE POINT SEVEN TELL ME. THE PROJECTED FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IS TOTAL FUNDS SIXTEEN POINT FOUR BILLION. EIGHT POINT NINE FEDERAL FIVE POINT EIGHT EIGHT AND ONE POINT EIGHT COUNTY FUNDS. SO THAT'S THE OVERVIEW OF CURRENT AND BUDGET YEAR FOR FUNDING FOR IHS US WITH REGARDS TO CASE LOAD THE I JUST AS RECIPIENT CASELOAD DOES CONTINUE TO GROW- THE AUTHORIZED CASES AS OF DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY. SIX HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT STATEWIDE. I'M AS COMPARED TO- LAST DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN WAS AT. 1-660-016-0006 HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX. IT PROVIDERS- THAT THAT SERVES THOSE RECIPIENTS A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ALSO CONTINUES TO GROW AS OF DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX. UP FROM THE- PRIOR DECEMBER OF NINETEEN WHICH WAS AT. FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SORRY FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE THOUSAND. SEVENTY THREE SO THAT IS WHERE WE ARE ASKED FOR I JUST SAYS AS FAR AS FUNDING AND SHE SLOWED. THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS TO RESPOND- I BELIEVE NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM SAY WHAT SIMONE. MISSING THAT CORRECTLY. IT DID YOU WANT ME TO COVER THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD IN THIS THIS AREA. I BELIEVE. THEN WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM- THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES NOW. YES THIS IS DEBBIE FROM THE PHARMACIST OF SERVICES YOU HAD TWO OTHER QUESTIONS. WHEN YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT PLEASE. OKAY IS STILL ONE WAS READ RELATED TO THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE AYE OBSESSED POPULATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ADDRESS RISING COSTS WITHIN WITHIN A I HSS- YES AS WE'VE ALL BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THIS POPULATION. CONTINUES TO GROW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE VERY- THAT JUNE TWO THAT TO THAT SITUATION AND IT WAS A PART OF THE MASTER PLAN- DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO LOOK AT AND ADDRESS THESE COSTS IT WILL BE ONGOING DIALOGUE THROUGH THAT PROCESS AS WELL AS INTERNALLY. TO LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THESE TYPES OF SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND INDIVIDUALS CAN REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES SAFELY AND AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND THAT WILL BE- INTO NEED TO BE LOOKING LOOKED AT ON. AN ONGOING BASIS- AS FAR AS THE DEPARTMENT ASSUMING COST SAVINGS RUSH AVOIDING INSTITUTIONAL CARE AS A PART OF BUDGETING THAT WE DON'T ASSUME COST SAVINGS THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A COST AVOIDANCE SITUATION AS FAR AS THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT HAVING TO GO INTO INSTITUTIONAL CARE. THE THIRD QUESTION WAS RELATED TO THE L. A. O.'S COMMENTS AROUND- ARE LIMITING MY AGE IS A SERVICES- DOES THERE IS INSTRUCTION YOU THE OPTION TO YOU- IMPLEMENTED A 7% ACROSS THE BOARD. REDUCTION TO BE JUST REALLY CLEAR THAT- THAT CURRENT. THE CURRENT BUDGET AND THE BUDGET FOR THE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DEALT INCLUDING- TAKING BACK TO- BATCH 7% ACROSS THE BOARD REDUCTION. AS FAR AS VIOLATING THE ADA ANYTIME THERE IS- IMPLEMENTATION OF REDUCTIONS THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR SOME TYPE OF MEDICATION THIS THIS- 7% HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE PAST OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE IMPLEMENT THESE THINGS WE DO WORK VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL OF THAT AND BELIEVE THAT IT WAS LAWFUL THE IMPLEMENTED. SO THAT'S- THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO. SPEAK TO ON THAT UNLESS FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO. ADD ANYTHING ADDITIONAL TO EITHER OF THOSE LAST TWO. FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME PROPERTY ANSWER ANY QUESTION YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF WE CAN HERE- FROM SOMEWHERE SIMONA MY SAYING THAT CORRECTLY HELP ME. YOU ARE OKAY NEED. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS WHITE CM AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. DRC IS JOINED BY FIFTY SEVEN ORGANIZATIONS AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A PERMANENT REPEAL OF THE 7% BY HSS HOURS HI. THE I JUST AS PROGRAM KEEPS UP CALIFORNIANS WITH DISABILITIES INCLUDING SENIORS AND THEIR OWN HOMES AND SAVES TAXPAYERS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. AS OF JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE CONSUMERS AND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVEN PROVIDERS IN THE AYE INTEREST AS PROGRAM. 55% OF PROVIDERS LIVE WITH THEIR CONSUMERS AND THE LIVING DATA IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PROVIDER WAGES OFTEN SUPPORT THE BASIC NEEDS OF THE HOUSEHOLD. FOR MANY FAMILIES WHO DEPEND ON AID TO PROCESS INCOME TO LIVE IN CARE FOR THEIR LOOK LEFT ONE AT HOME RATHER THAN AN INSTITUTION BUT CUTS REALLY MEANS DOUBLE IMPACT IN TERMS OF LOSS OF SERVICES. FOR A FAMILY MEMBER AS WELL AS LOSS OF WAGES. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT THAT THE REDUCTION IN AGES JUST HOURS WILL HAVE ON PARTICIPANTS IN THE H. SAYS PROGRAM. AND WHILE I'VE TOUCHED ON THIS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE VERY CLEAR. IF TEMPERAMENTAL THE 7% CUT TIE EACH SUBCLASS WOULD BE DEVASTATING I JUST AS CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS ALIKE. A CONSUMER ASSESSED AS NEEDING THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF MONTHLY HOURS WOULD LOSE EIGHT OF THOSE HOURS. THOSE SERVICE HOURS ARE NEEDED FOR FEEDING MILK PREPARATION BAITING AND OTHER AUTHORIZED TASKS. A CONSUMER WHO WAS ASSESSED AS NEEDING THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TWO HUNDRED. AND EIGHTY THREE HOURS WOULD LOSE TWENTY HOURS OF HELP PER MONTH. MORE THAN TWO DAYS OF PERSONAL CARE. FOR DOMESTIC SERVICES. THE NEW FOR PERSONAL CARE SO. IS NOT GOING AWAY BUT THE HELP WHAT. THE 7% REDUCTION IN IT SAYS HOURS MEANS PROVIDERS WORKING FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER WOULD LOSE A HUNDRED AND NINETEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY TWO CENTS OF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME. BAKERIES TO WAIT CHEST MEANS CONSUMERS WILL HAVE A MORE LIMITED SUPPLY OF HOME CARE WORKERS MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO REMAIN SAFELY IN THEIR HOMES. AND POSSIBLY FORCING THEM AN INSTITUTION INSTITUTIONAL CARE SUCH AS NURSING HOMES. MANY I JUST HAS PROVIDERS ALREADY LIVE IN POVERTY AND ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOOD STAMPS AND OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS. BECAUSE OF THE LOSS OF INCOME PROVIDERS MAY SEEK WORK ELSEWHERE. CLOSING I'D LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE OSCAR LOCATION SETTLED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. WHAT THE PROMISE THAT THE 7% CUT WOULD BE PERMANENTLY RESTORED BY TWENTY FIFTEEN. HERE WE ARE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE YET AGAIN ASKING OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS TO STAND BY THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS MADE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME TO STAND BY THIS AGREEMENT IT IS TODAY. IN A TIME WHEN WE HAVE SEEN INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN NURSING HOMES AND INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS CONTRACT COBIT NINETEEN AT DISPROPORTIONATE RATES. MANY WHO ARE NO LONGER WITH US TODAY WE REALLY SHOULD BE WORKING FULL TIME TO FURTHER INVEST IN THE- IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HELP INDIVIDUALS LIVE SAFELY AT HOME. AT THE VERY LEAST FOR OUR PURPOSES TODAY WE SHOULD PERMANENTLY SUSPEND THE 7% HI THAT HAS BEEN LOOMING OVER THIS PROGRAM FOR FAR TOO LONG. DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA AND ARE FIFTY SEVEN PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS CALL ON OR LEGISLATIVE LEADERS TO PRIORITIZE THE HEALTH IN WITH WELL BEING OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND INTO THE FUTURE WHAT OTHER CHALLENGES MEET MAY AWAIT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING FROM YOU. LOL. THANK AYE I WOULD JUST WANT TO FLAG THAT OUR OFFICE RECENTLY RELEASED A WRITE UP IN WHICH WE REVIEWED I'M BASIC PROGRAM TRENDS WITHIN THE PROGRAM INCLUDING GROPING CASELOAD HOURS PER CASE AND WAGES AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT TURCA CONCERNS- WE WOULD NOTE THAT REGION JUST NOTICED THAT SOME PROGRAM TRENDS WERE SLIGHTLY IMPACTED IN THE EARLIER MONTHS OF COLD BED- SOME OF THE PROGRAM TRENDS HAVE RETURNED TO CREE COVE IN NINETEEN LEVELS- WHILE OTHERS- MAY NOT HAVE FULLY- FOR EXAMPLE WE NOTICED THAT THE GROWTH IN PAID CASELOAD WHILE WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO SEE A GROWTH IT'S A SLIGHTLY SLOWER GROWTH RATE- RELATIVE TO PRIOR YEARS. ON THAT STARTED IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS IN COPING NINETEEN AND AGAIN WE HAVE NO CONCERNS- WHAT THE SLIGHT CHANGES IN PROGRAM TRANSFER JUST FLAG AS WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ON THESE TRENDS AND PROVIDE ANY UPDATES TO THE LEGISLATURE AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE ADDITIONALLY- I WOULD JUST WANT TO- FLAG- OTHER COMMENTS WE NEED AS IT RELATES TO THE 7% RESTORATION AGAIN UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL AND- HE IS PROPOSING TO BOTH MAINTAIN AND EXTENDED THE- SUSPENSION LANGUAGE AS IT AS IT RELATES TO THE 7% RESTORATION- A- SIMILAR TO. THE EIGHTY SEE ISSUE RECKON OF THE- BRIDGE. THE NEW BUT BILL SAYS- AS TREATS. AN ONGOING I JUST SAYS SERVICE COSTS. AS TEMPORARY. SO WHAT THAT ESSENTIALLY WOULD MEAN THEN BY REJECTING THAT IS AGAIN UNDER CURRENT LAW WE WOULD JUST- AND HERE TO THE EXISTING SUSPENSION LANGUAGE AND THAT CALCULATION WOULD BE DONE IN MAY AND AGAIN OUR OFFICE BASED OFF OF RECENT REVENUES- IT'S LIKELY THAT BACK CALCULATION WOULD SHOW THAT WE DO HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS- TO- SUPPORT THE I. HSS. SUSPENSION IN THE FOR PAY AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO THEN THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF PERMANENTLY RESTORING I JUST US HOURS ARE PROVIDING FUNDING NEEDED TO DO THAT- HE SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES. REJECT THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE WE ALSO SUGGEST CLEANING UP STATUTE- WHICH CURRENTLY TIES THE RESTORATION OF THE SERVICE HOURS TO THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX AND THIS CLEANUP WOULD AGAIN JUST FURTHER ENSURE THAT BY REJECTING THE SUSPENSION LANGUAGE THE 7% RESTORATION IS MAINTAINED ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- YEAH I WOULD CAN CURRENT INCOME WE'RE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND INCREASING LIKE WE DO AND TO THINK ABOUT. A MEETING SUFFERS AND CUTS JUST DOESN'T DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE THIS POPULATION DECREASING I THINK. AS MY GENERATION CONTINUES TO- THE BOOMERS CONTINUE TO AGE- AND AS OUR SOCIETIES CONTINUE TO CHANGE WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T LIVING IN THE SAME NUCLEAR LITTLE ENVIRONMENT LIKE THEY USED TO BUT THEY'RE SPREAD OUT. MORE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK MORE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE TO WORK. AND I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY AS A MEMBER OF THE LATINO CAUCUS WE ESPECIALLY HAS BEEN HARD HIT WITH THIS- AS A MEMBER OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WE KNOW THAT MORE WOMEN END UP. BEING CARE GIVERS A LOT OF THEIR LIFE AND THEN AT THE VERY END OF THEIR LIFE AND UP ALONE HAND IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THEMSELVES WITHOUT. PROPER CARE AND AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBT CAUCUS WE KNOW OUR LGBT BROTHERS AND SISTERS SPECIALLY. ON THOSE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE EVEN MORE AT RISK OF BEING ALONE WHEN THEY'RE OLD AND WITHOUT THE SUPPORT. STAFF TO MAINTAIN THEM AND AS WAS POINT OUT WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED IN OUR- CONGREGATE SETTINGS. DURING THIS PANDEMIC WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN. SOMETIMES YOU KNOW YOU'RE TRAPPED AND THE PANDEMIS COME THROUGH AND MORE PEOPLE HAVE DIED AND A LOT OF THOSE WHO HAVE DIED AS AS I THINK WE'VE ALL SEEN. HAVE BEEN SOME OF THE POOREST AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE TO LEAST ACCESS SO THAT IS NOT A GOOD REFLECTION ON US AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO BETTER. AT PROVIDING THE SERVICE. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- SO THAT'S THE QUESTION FOR FARM SOCIAL SERVICE AGAIN PRESHEAF YEAR PRESENTATION YOU DID MENTION THAT- IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL YOUR QUOTE NAT ARE SUSPENDING THE 7% CUT FOR TWO YEARS IS. I REALIZE WE PASS A BUDGET EACH YEAR BUT- USE THAN APPLYING THAT WHEN YOU'RE DOING OUT YOUR CALCULATIONS ON YOUR THREE THERE'S AUTOMATIC 7% CUT. THIS IS DEBBIE FINANCING ANSWER THAT IF THERE'S A REMOTE CHANCE THAT. SYDNEY IF YOU WANT TO THAT'S OUR NON. AS OF RIGHT NOW THE LANGUAGE STATES THAT ON THE SUSPENSION WOULD GO INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO OKAY SO THERE IS A YOUR PLANE CAUGHT. CORRECT OKAY SO I THINK- THAT THAT'S TROUBLESOME- BE INTERESTING DURING THE JUSTIFICATIONS THAT BUT I GUESS THE SECOND QUESTION AND ACTUALLY- THIS. WELL IT. SOUNDS IN FOR DEPARTURE SERVICE IT DO YOU CALL THE- U. T. TO YOU CAREFULLY SAID TRYING TO CORRECT THIS BY SAYING IT'S NOT A COST SAVINGS OF THE COSTA WAIT AND SEE. AND I DON'T SPEND TOO MUCH TIME PARSING LANGUAGE BUT- TO ME IT'S STILL A COST SAVINGS BECAUSE I MEAN. IT BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT NOW YOU WEEK WE CAN TRY TO HIDE THE MEDICAL PROGRAMS IN THE NURSING HOME PROGRAM FROM PEOPLE MAYBE THEY WON'T SIGN UP FOR MEDICARE ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT IT. BUT THAT'S AN ENTITLEMENT SO. IF SOMEONE IS NOT ABLE TO GET THERE. SIR I HSS SERVICES. YEAH THEY NEED THEM NOW NEED TO CARE- WELL FIRST OF ALL I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD POLICY WE DENY IT TO THEM ALL TOGETHER I MEAN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY QUOTED POLICY OPTION ONE THAT I WOULD NOT ACCEPT. BUT AT LEAST FOR RIGHT NOW A AS I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY UNDER CURRENT POLICIES DALY BEAT AND ABLE TO- GET NURSING HOME CARE. IS THAT CORRECT- MY WRONG. THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS ANYBODY FROM GETTING NURSING HOME CARE ALL ALL I WAS REALLY TRYING TO SPEAK TO WAS THAT MY BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE WE'RE NOT MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT COST SAVINGS- BECAUSE- CALCULATING COST AVOIDANCE BECOMES MORE COMPLEX- OKAY WELL WE- DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT SERVICES INDIVIDUALS CAN ACCESS IT. IF YOU TO THE BALLOT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT WELL WE DON'T LET'S NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME PARSING WORDS BUT I KNOW WE HAD A REPORT PREVIOUSLY SCENARIO SEVERAL YEARS AGO. SHOW THAT ACTUALLY- BUT A CALL COST AVOIDANCE OR COST SAVINGS THAT BASICALLY- WE- YEAH. TO I HSS AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THE CASELOADS GOING UP BECAUSE THE MORE PEOPLE WHO NEED THE SERVICES. WOULD BE SPENDING MORE ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE NOT SAYING THAT EVERYONE AND I JUST AS IF THEY WERE YOU KNOW CAN GET IT WOULD END UP IN THE SEASONAL CARE BUT A GOOD PORTION WOULD WHICH IS OF COURSE A LOT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN ACTUALLY ARE SPENDING WOULD GO UP QUITE A BIT. DONE SO I JUST WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SUSPENSION. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I DO APPRECIATE IN THE ALLEY- REPORT ON PAGE TEN THE A CHART SHOWING STATEWIDE AVERAGE IHS US EARLY HOURLY WAGE AND HOW IS WE'VE GOTTEN CLOSE. FIND OUT BASICALLY THE LINE BETWEEN THE STATE MINIMUM WAGE IN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE HSS HOURLY WAGES SENSUALLY HE ARE ALMOST OVERLAPPING- AND I THINK THAT TELLS YOU THAT- IN TERMS THE AMOUNT OF SPACE YOU KNOW. HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING AND IT'S- BASICALLY I MEAN. OUR OWN LAWS ARE REQUIRED REQUIRING THE WAGES TO GO UP FOR APPROPRIATE REASONS AND I PROBABLY VOTED FOR THOSE LAWS- BUT- IT'S AN YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT WE CAN CUT. WAGES AND WE SHOULD OR SHOULD CUT WAGES AND THEN SO THE QUESTION IS THAT IF WE DO THE 7% CUT I GUESS IT'S 7% HOURS WE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS SO. IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY AND I PRESUME WHEN PEOPLE GET SERVICES THROUGH I JUST AS WE DO DO AN EVALUATION NOW TO EVALUATE THAT. THERE NEEDS FOR EIGHTY ALSO FOR IT SO WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN WHEN IF WE DO A 7% CUT I MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE S. COTTON HOURS WE CAN'T LEGALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE PASSED THE MINIMUM WAGE ACTUALLY CUT THEIR SALARY BY SEVEN PERCENT- ESPECIALLY SINCE THE TWO LINES ARE ESSENTIALLY OVERLAPPING- SO. WHAT DOES WHAT DOES THE DEPARTMENT AND AGAIN- OUR FINANCE THINGS GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF WE DO IF AND. IN TWO YEARS WE DO A 7% CUT. THIS PERCENT CUT IS TO AUTHORIZED HOURS IT DOESN'T CUT. RIGHT RIGHT I THINK WHAT THE INTENT OF THE PERSON I WAS SPEAKING WAS TO SAY THAT IF THERE'S FEWER HOURS THE PAY OF THE PROVIDER IF THEY DON'T FIND AT OTHER NO THAT'S IT OKAY SO I GET THAT BUT NOT BUT LET'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS TO THE CLIENT. SO THE CLIENT YOU'VE ASSESSED THE SAY THEY NEED THEY HAVE THESE NEEDS THEY CAN'T FEED THEMSELVES OR WHATEVER CAN'T BE THEMSELVES OR BECAUSE OF THEIR DISABILITY. THEN WE TAKE AWAY. YOU KNOW HALF A DAY A DAY HEARD UP TO TWO DAYS OF SERVICES. SO DO THEY NOT EAT THOSE DAYS I MEAN WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN. THE PERSON FINANCES ARE HAND UP THERE. OKAY HI SARAH HANSON ANTENNA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AGAIN I THINK I JUST WANT TO REITERATE HERE WE RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY OF THE SITUATION WE ARE YOU KNOW. COMMITTED TO REASSESSING AS WE GO THROUGH AND THEY ARE NOT FORECAST THE STRUCTURAL NONTERMINAL TIRE WE ARE DOING THIS- THAT'S NOT GOING BASIS DIFFICULT OF A CONVERSATION AS I WOULD WANT TO REITERATE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE. THAT LET'S SEE. NINETY NINE NINE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION. TOTAL FINE OF WHICH FOUR HUNDRED FORTY NINE POINT EIGHT MILLION AS GENERAL-FUND. TO RESTORE THIS OUR PRESENT THROUGH DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO JUST REENTERING THE FACT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES INCLUDE THE RESTORATION AT THIS POINT FOR OKAY. AND FIRST OF ALL I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT AS I POINTED OUT IN OTHER AREAS FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE A 7% CUT ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE BUDGET FOR EVERYONE ELSE FOR EXAMPLE TRANSPORTATION WE DON'T TELL PEOPLE WHO BUILD OUR ROADS. THAT BY THE WAY IF THE ECONOMY ISN'T SO GOOD YOU GET SAID ALUMAX 7% CUT IN YOUR CONTRACT TO BUILD WHATEVER ROAD REBUILDING OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ARE IT PROJECTS RIGHT DO WE HAVE IN OUR CONTRACTS 27% CUT AUTOMATIC CUT FOR YOUR I. T. PROJECT NOW WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK IN AND RENEGOTIATE CONTRACT NOW I TELL YOU THE ECONOMY IS BADLY IF I WOULD GO BACK HEY BY THE WAY. NO HE DO FERTILITY BROCHURE SHOWING CASH BUT I'M NOT SURE WHY. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INCLUDING THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM. WE NEED TO TELL PEOPLE. THAT BY THE WAY. WE'RE GONNA BUILD THIS CUT IN AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS EACH YEAR WE'RE GOING TO GO AND SAY WELL YOU DON'T WANNA DO THIS YEAR. BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO HANG OVER YOU. WERE NOT GOING TO DO NEXT YEAR BUT IT'S GONNA HANG OVER YOU. ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S A CORE SERVICE TONIGHT THAT THAT'S WHY GOES BACK TO MY QUESTION OF WHAT WHAT YOU SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN YOU DECIDE TO PULL THE CAT. RIGHT WITH- YOU KNOW IT'S THE PERSON NOT SUPPOSED TO EAT FOR A DAY. IT'S ENOUGH TO GET PAID FOR A DAY OR TWO DAYS OR WHATEVER DEBT REPRESENTS IN TERMS OF HOURS. BECAUSE AFTER ALL DIDN'T END UP IN THE PROGRAM. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE NEEDS IN FACT WE EVEN REQUIRED OR FOR YOU TO. GET THE SERVICES THAT. YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE YOU HAVE YOU DID YOU NEED THE SERVICES. I MEAN WE DO IT'S NOT LIKE ANYONE CAN JUST SIGN UP FOR IT WITHOUT HAVING TO GET AN ASSESSMENT DONE. AND SO TO ME. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. TO TAKE A CORE PROGRAM. THAT IN BUT WHICH BY THE WAY IN THE END COLLECTIVELY AND WE DON'T THE CASE BY CASE WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE US MONEY BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT THEY END UP IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE. FINANCIALLY BECAUSE WE PRIDE REALLY COULDN'T STOP FEEDING PEOPLE OR STOP IT YOU KNOW IT SAID IT. I'LL BE PEOPLE SELF. EVENTUALLY NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. AT LEAST A PORTION OF THEM SO. SO THAT'S TO ME SO AGAIN- THAT'S I THINK THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM AND WHY IS IT ONLY IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INCLUDING THIS PROGRAM WHICH IS SO CRITICAL. TO PEOPLE'S CARE. THAT WE KEEP THIS ESSENTIALLY CUT HOVERING OVER THEM. RIGHT I MEAN IS THIS THIRD YOU YOUR BUDGETING OR. SO YES THANK YOU SO MUCH. ACTUALLY IT'S INTERESTING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR KEEPING THINGS AS YOU KNOW FOR PUTTING THE MONEY THERE BUT MAYBE MAYBE SHOULD TAKE THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT. INSTEAD OF- SAYING THAT. BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TWO YEARS LATER WE HAVE TO. PRAY THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN YOU KNOW. AT THAT POINT IN TIME. AND IS THAT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THINGS AFTER WE DON'T DO THAT FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE. AND WE DO THAT FOR OTHER THINGS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUT NOT FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS WE DON'T HAVE A COTTON AND SAID IT WAS A SPENDING CUT. HIM BUILDING A 7% CUT ACROSS. OTHER DEPARTMENTS. UNLESS I'M WRONG I MEAN I DON'T KNOW I'VE I'VE- CAN'T YOU KNOW I MAINLY DO THE SUB COMMITTEE BUT I DO PAY ATTENTION TO THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET. IS THERE AN EXAMPLE WHERE THAT'S BEING DONE ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE BUDGET OUTSIDE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. W. PARTNER FINANCE. THANK YES ANYTIME OUT APARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD JUST NOTE SINCE THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM INVESTMENTS THESE PROGRAMS SINCE THAT'S THE DESTRUCTION A BALANCED BUDGET TO SUPPORT ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THE SUSPENSION FRAMEWORK IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ADDRESSES IMBALANCE AGAIN SENATOR PAT AND WE FULLY RECOGNIZE THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE ONLY WELCOME CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PROPOSAL. OKAY AND- I APPRECIATE THAT'S THE ANSWER YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A AND- THE- BUT I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW A FULL DISCUSSION AND HE SAID REALLY WHAT IS A REAL ALTERNATIVE RIGHT I MEAN OF COURSE IS A BUDGET SO CAN WE TALK ABOUT MONEY AND NUMBERS AND I KNOW THAT BUT ALSO WHAT DOES THAT TRANSLATE INTO- WHAT WE DON'T DO IT- THE OTHER QUESTION I ALSO HAVE IS THAT- AGAIN- IS- IT IN THIS. PROPOSED IT'S ADDRESS BUT I THINK THE ISSUES COME UP AND SO I UNDERSTAND CERTAIN THINGS ARE EXPIRING FRIDAY JUSTICE IN TERMS OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND SO FORTH- YOU NOTED THAT THE SPLIT OF MONEY BETWEEN. THE STATE AND THE COUNTY THAT AGREEMENT. AS WELL. AT SO WHAT WHAT'S THE STATUS OF. OF THE DECISION IN REGARDS TO- HOW THEY'LL BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE I IF I REMEMBER RECALL HOWEVER MANY YEARS. EXACTLY WHICH SURELY MADE THAT AGREEMENT I BELIEVE ACCESS EXPIRES THIS YEAR. SO IS THAT GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS BUDGET. THE FINANCE RECRUITMENT YES. WITHOUT THE COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES AND C. W. DHSS- THE NEEDS FOR ITS ONGOING AND RESOURCES DO YOU OR THE- AGREEMENTS. SO THAT'S OKAY I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER MEANT SO- IS IT IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THEN. YES WE'RE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THAT OKAY. BUT YOU DON'T EITHER IS NO PROPOSAL AT THIS POINT TIME. NO NOT AT THIS OKAY AND- WHEN WE TRY BY SOON WE GET IT WELL WHEN DO WE EXPECT TO GET THE PROPOSAL I PROVIDE PRESUME AT THE LATEST MAY REVISE BUT WE ALSO NEED TIME FOR CONCERTS IT FOR CAN. TO CONSIDER IT SO. RIGHT RIGHT CURRENT STATUTE. SORRY THIS IS DANNY WITH DSS MY CURRENT STATUTE- AT THE TIME THAT MINIMUM WAGE GOES TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR LOCALLY BARGAINED WAGES AND BENEFIT INCREASES. CAPS THAT WE'VE HAD OF WHAT THE STATE WILL PARTICIPATE IN IS REMOVED THERE'S NO LONGER A CALF. BUT THE COST OF THE INCREASE IS SPLIT BETWEEN THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE- 65% COUNTY AND 35% STATE SO THAT. THE AB PORTION THAT THAT COUNTY AND STATE HAVE IS SLIPPED AT THAT POINT IN TIME THAT'S MY CURRENT STATUTE I THINK A NAM WAS TALKING ABOUT THERE'S CONTINUED DIALOGUE WITH. GOING ON OKAY. OKAY AND I THINK- CERTAINLY INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM- THE- THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS IN THE COUNTY IS ABOUT- THAT THAT ABOUT ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A PROPOSALS WELL- BUT WE EIGHT I JUST WANNA BE SURE YOU PUT A PIN ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO BE REVISED WE OFTEN HAVE. ARE SHORT ON TIME AND WE HAVE TO RUSH BUT WE'LL BE SURE WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TIME TO MORE THOROUGHLY DISCUSSED THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S NOT ACTUALLY. TECHNICALLY THE FINAL PART IS THE GENDER BUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO COME UP AND CAN BE VERY IMPORTANT. I WOULD HOPE THAT WOULD MANDATE OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON NOW. TO ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION DISCONTINUATION. HEY THIS IS DEBBIE THOMPSON AGAIN- FROM THE SOCIAL SERVICES ADULT PROGRAMS AND I AM GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR QUESTIONS AROUND ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION BCP- I'M ACTUALLY GONNA FLIP THAT ORDER AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE OF KIND OF WHERE THINGS ARE- AND THEN TALK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL FOR THE CONTINUED RESOURCES. SO THAT THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS WHICH BECAME LAW- THE END OF FEDERAL LAW AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS HAVE HAD A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- DID CAME UP WITH AN APPROACH FOR. DOING THE ELECTRONIC VISIT VERIFICATION FOR I JUST US AND WPCS PROVIDERS OF THE STAKEHOLDERS FELT COMFORTABLE WITH AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT- THAT APPROACH- AFTER RECEIVING- APPROVALS FOR OUR- I THE END OF PLANNING TO. BY THE- BY GOVERNMENT- WE BEGAN THAT PILOT WITH L. A. COUNTY IN JULY OF NINETEEN AND THEN BEGAN IMPLEMENTING- THAT SYSTEM A STATEWIDE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AS OF THE END OF THE YEAR WE HAVE AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE. OVER 98% OF OUR RECIPIENTS AND PROVIDERS WHO ARE ENROLLED. IN ONE OF THE ELECTRONIC OPTIONS EITHER THE ONLINE OR THE TELEPHONIC OPTION WE'VE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL- THE ROLLOUT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT- IT. IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE DID GET SOME FURTHER GUIDANCE THAT WAS RELEASED BY- CMS TALKING ABOUT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF EDV AND INDUSTRY AIDED- DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THAT IMPACTED. OUR APPROACH AND- THAT WENT ON FOR QUITE QUITE SOME TIME AND WE HAVE NOW RECEIVED FROM THEM- CLARITY. THAT THEY- THEY HAVE TO US THAT ARE SYSTEM APPROACH NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED IN ORDER TO FULLY MEET THE EBV REQUIREMENTS- WHAT NEEDS TO BE. MODIFIED IS THAT. PROVIDE NON LIVE IN PROVIDERS HAVE TO CHECK IN AND CHECK OUT IN THE SYSTEM AT THE TIME THEY BEGIN SERVICE AND SERVICE AND AFTER THOSE TWO POINTS IN TIME THEIR LOCATION HAS TO BE ELECTRONICALLY CAPTURE. WE CURRENTLY IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DO COLLECT THE INFORMATION BUT IT'S NOT IN REAL TIME AND IT'S NOT USING- GPS OR- A METHOD THAT THE- THAT THAT CMS HAS DETERMINED NEEDS THAT THE REQUIREMENT. SO THEREFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE AN UPDATE TO THAT SYSTEM WE DID BEGAN BEGAN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT THE NEED TO DO THIS CHANGE IN IN THE FALL AMISH AND WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FROM CMS BATCH WE ARE ALLOWED TO EXCLUDE LIVE IN PROVIDERS FROM THE EBV REQUIREMENTS ALTOGETHER. SO PART OF OUR DISCUSSION IN THE FALL WAS THAT THE STATE MADE THE DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH EXCLUDING LIVIN PROVIDERS WE SHARED THAT WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THE METHOD BY WHICH WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH PROVIDERS AND THAT'S STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY AND THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO LIVE IN PROVIDERS ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED TO DO THE EASY THE REQUIREMENTS THEY ARE STILL USING AN ELECTRONIC MATHIS THERE EIHER- USING ONLINE OR- TELEPHONIC METHODS FOR SUBMITTING THEIR TIME. AT HOWEVER THEY DO NOT HAVE TO ANSWER THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OF START TIME AND TIME AND LOCATION WHEN THEY ARE ENSURING THAT INFOR. INFORMATION INTO THE SYSTEM. FOR NON LIVE IN PROVIDE. WE DID TALK ABOUT ONE OPTION WITH STAKEHOLDERS- WHICH IN THE FALL WHICH WAS AROUND- YOU UTILIZING AN OUT AND OUT. THAT WOULD BE UTILIZED A GPS TYPE FUNCTIONALITY CAPTURING- LOCATION COORDINATES AT THOSE TWO POINTS AND TIMES THAT I SPOKE TO- OBVIOUSLY AS YOU'RE PROBABLY WELL AWARE ARE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE HAD LOTS OF CONCERNS ABOUT- GPS AS AN OPTION. AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE WITH CMS WHAT. OTHER ALTERNATIVES WE MAY BE ABLE TO OFFER FOR MEETING THIS REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD NOT INCLUDE GPS DOES JUST THAT IS WHERE THE POINT IN THE PROCESS WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. WE ARE INTERESTED IN AND IN SEEING WHAT MAY HAPPEN UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONABOUT FLEXIBILITIES IN THIS AREA- AND WE ARE EXPLORING THAT AND ONCE WE HAVE MORE CLARITY ABOUT WHAT OTHER LTERNATIVES THAT THAT MAY WE MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE AVAILABLE. TO OUR PROVIDERS AND RECIPIENTS IN THIS IN THIS- EBV IN MEETING THE CD REQUIREMENT- THEN IT WE WILL BE RE ENGAGING THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TALK THROUGH THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND COME TO DECISIONS ABOUT HOW WE WILL BE MOVING FORWARD. AND WILL THEN BEGIN IMPLEMENTATION. OF THOSE CHANGES. FROM WHAT WE ABOUT- ABOUT THESE TYPES OF KAFR CAPTURING THIS INFORMATION- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE SYSTEM CHANGES WILL BE NECESSARILY. TAKEN TAKE A LONG TIME OR BE SIGNIFICANT HOWEVER WHAT IT WILL TAKE TIME AND BE VERY CRITICAL IS ENSURING THAT THE NON LIVE IN PROVIDERS ARE CLEARLY- INFORMED AND PROVIDED TRAINING AND SUPPORT AROUND- HOW TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM WITH THOSE CHANGES AND SO THAT WOULD BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHANGES ONCE WE DECIDE. WHAT DIRECTION WE WILL BE GOING SO THAT IS WHERE WE'RE AT IN THE PROCESS. BECAUSE OF THOSE CHANGES. WE ARE REQUESTING THAT ARE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS THAT. WE HAVE SHE'D SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES ON THE- CONTINUE FOR ANOTHER YEAR IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE ALL THE NECESSARY RISKS ARE SUPPORT AND- IN MAKING THESE CHANGES ON THOSE POSITIONS AND QUESTION THREE THOSE POSITIONS WILL WORK ALSO BEING UTILIZED TO SUPPORT THE MANDATE FOR. PAYROLL PAYROLL CARDS OR DIRECT DEPOSIT TO BE UTILIZED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT BY THE PROVIDERS AND WE'VE REALLY ROLLED BACK MANDATE OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR EBV TRAINING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT SYSTEM- AND THAT HAS BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL APPROACH- THAT WE HAVE ABOUT 75% OF- PROVIDERS- THAT ARE ALREADY ENROLLED. IN A DIRECT DEPOSIT MESSAGE TO RECEIVE THEIR THEIR PAYMENT- COMBINING THAT USE OF AN ELECTRONIC SUBMISSION OF TIME AND AN ELECTRONIC- PROCESS FOR RECEIVING PAYMENT HAS LED TO PROVIDERS BEING PAID WITHIN THREE OR FOUR DAYS OF SUBMISSION OF THEIR TIME WHICH HAS BEEN AND IT AT A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT TO OUR PROVIDERS AND LEAD TO A LOT OF TO SUCCESS. IN IN THE MEETING THAT A NEW MANDATE AND IN QUESTION FOR IT ASKED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT- ZACKS. THANK THAT MANDATE IS ONE TWO TWO ONE AND DO WE X. PROVIDERS TO HAVE BEEN TRANSITIONED BY THAT DATE AS I SAID ABOUT 75% OF PROVIDERS HAVE ALREADY TRANSITIONS TO AN ELECTRONIC- MATHIS SAID AB EITHER DIRECT DEPOSIT OR A CARD FOR RECEIVING THEIR PAYMENT- HOWEVER THAT STATUTE ALSO ALLOWS FOR. ADJUSTING BACK DATE BASED ON THE STATUS OF THE EVG OUR SYSTEM AND WHERE WE ARE WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT'S REQUIREMENTS AND SO BASED ON WHERE WE ARE WITH THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL OF MOVING BACK TO EAT. OUT AND WILL BE- COMMUNICATING AS- FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS ARE HAPPENING. IN THAT ERA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANYTHING. LMAO DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THIS ONE. HELLO PLEASE HEY. JACKIE BRUCE YEAH WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT- WE REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL AND HAVE NO CONCERN THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPARENTLY CONCERNED WITH THIS BILL WILL GET TO THIS REMOVE ONTO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. SS I SS P. YOUR MUTE MISS THOMPSON. GET TAKE YOURSELF OFF MUTE GOT IT WOULD YOU SORRY. IT'S GOING TO MY OTHER DOCUMENTS- STILL IN RELATIONSHIP QUESTIONS ON SS I SS HE THE FIRST ONE BEING CASELOAD AND FUNDING LEVELS FOR SSI AND S. S. P. SO- THAT CURRENT CASELOAD- FOR SSI S. S. P. I'M GONNA START SORRY MR WITH THE BUDGET. THE ESTIMATED BUDGET FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR WAS NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION ARM TWO POINT SEVEN ONE BILLION OF THAT BEING THE S. S. P. PORTION- FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR ESTIMATED BUDGET IS AGAIN AT NINE POINT EIGHT BILLION. TWO POINT SIX NINE BILLION OF THAT BEING THE ACCESS- HE OR SHE CAN. DE UM CASELOAD FOR SSI S. S. P. DOES CONTINUE TO DECLINE SITE SLIGHTLY- IT. IS IT HAD BEEN. IN TWO. FOURTEEN ABOUT ONE POINT THREE MILLION AND WE'RE JUST UNDER ONE POINT TWO MILLION- PROJECTED IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SO WE HAVE ON ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS pLEGISLATIVE STAFF AROUND SOME OF THE FACTORS IMPACTING THIS CASE LOAD AND ITS DECLINE- AND I ARE HAPPY TO DISCUSS THOSE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED- AT THIS TIME. OTHERWISE WE WILL MOVE TO YOUR NEXT QUESTION PLEASE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGARDING THIS STATE STIMULUS PAYMENTS TO SS I SS HE RECIPIENTS WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO SSA TO DETERMINE IF THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO. ISSUE A PAYMENT ON OUR BEHALF TO **** I. S. P. RECIPIENTS THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYMENT- THAT WAS PART OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS- WE HAVE ACTUALLY- CALL WITH THEM THIS WEEK TO ANSWER ANY REMAINING QUESTIONS THAT THEY MAY HAVE. IN THIS AREA AND THEN HOPE HOPE TO HAVE- A RESPONSE FROM THEM SHORTLY THERE AFTER. OKAY AND CAN YOU SPEAK ABOUT QUESTION NUMBER ONE LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THE EXPLANATION FOR THE DECLINING CASELOADS DECLINED OKAY YEAH HAPPY TO THAT- AS FAR AS THE DECLINE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED. ARE THAT THAT HAS YOU WERE REFERENCING EARLIER THE KIND OF BABY BOOMERS THAT ARE MOVING INTO THIS OLDER AGE GROUP- ARE ACTUALLY. THEIR MEDIAN INCOME IS HIGHER THAN IT USED TO BE OBVIOUSLY AND IT OFTENTIMES IS EXCEEDING THAT OF SOCIETY S. S. P. ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE- IMPACTS AS TO. FOLKS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR IT FOR THIS BENEFIT- AND- ANOTHER IS IMPROVEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY THAT- PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GATCH MEDICAL- PROCEDURES OR OTHER TYPES OF SUPPORTS THAT. ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO WORK. ON WITH WITH DISABILITIES SO THAT THEY ARE NOT MEETING THE BENEFITS THEY'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY BE EMPLOYED- PEOPLE ARE HAVING HEALTHIER BEHAVIORS AS FAR AS LIFESTYLE WHICH IS LEADING TO. TO BETTER HEALTH AND LESS NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE- AGAIN SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND THEN ON THE OTHER IS- ASSET LIMITS OF SSI AND S. S. P. I'M NOT REALLY- CHANGE THE ASSETS WRESTLE THRESHOLDS- I HAVE BEEN IN PLACE AND THE SAME- SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ABOVE THOSE THOSE TYPES OF LIMITS TO QUALIFY FOR THE BENEFITS OF PEOPLE HAVING. MORE MONEY AND MORE ASSETS ARE IMPACTING THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR THE SS I SS P. BENEFIT- THAT HAVEN'T REALLY CHANGED AS. FAR AS HOW THAT DETERMINATION IS NAY. TO IDENTIFIES ISSUE I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE YES I'M WITH- YOU KNOW MORE TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK. I THINK THE PART IN FINANCE MEETING ON THIS. DELEO. YES ONE THING WE WANT TO FLAG FOR THE COMMITTEE IS. WHATEVER AS AUTOMATION CHANGER FOR DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT IS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO ALLOCATE THE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR ONE TIME PAYMENT STATUSES ISIS P. RECIPIENT IF THERE'S AN ABILITY TO RETAIN THAT PUNCTUALITY SO IF IN THE FUTURE THE STATE WORK INTERESTED IN ISSUING ONE TIME TEMPORARY PAYMENTS TO US ISIS EXERCISES P. RECIPIENTS WE ALREADY HAVE THE CHANGE THEY CAN LEVERAGE THAT AND NOT FOUND IN CURRY DECISIONAL COSTS. IN ADMINISTERING. ANY POSSIBLE FUTURE PAYMENTS. GREAT POINT THINK YOU THAT DEPENDING ON THIS. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE THAT- AT LEAST WE DIDN'T TRY TO TAKE THE COLA FROM THEM WE DID THAT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. ALSO WE JUST NOTE THAT THE MAXIMUM MONTHLY AS A SITE PLAN FOR AT LEAST FOR INDIVIDUALS IS ACTUALLY BELOW THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND OF COURSE HAVE A HIGHER COST OF LIVING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I KNOW I KNOW THIS IS BEEN SUCH A CHALLENGE WE- THE DIFFICULTY WITH. THE HERE AND CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF- HOPING WE WERE ABLE AT LEAST GET. THE MAX'S THE CALFRESH A FEW YEARS AGO- AND- BUT- I THINK THIS IS REMAINS A CONTINUING CHALLENGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY AND THEN I THINKTHERE'S SOME REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS HELLO.

FLIP HOW DOES THAT IMPACT OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF THE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT SO ESSENTIALLY WE KNOW THAT FURTHER DOWNSTREAM IS ACTUALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AND SO IF NOW THE COUNTIES ARE HAVING TO BEAR A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF THESE COSTS WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. THIS IS JACKIE FROM THE ELIO- CENTER PAM HAPPY TO GET BACK TO YOU I'M GONNA HAVE TO CONNECT WITH OUR OTHER NINETEEN ANYONE REALIGNMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOLKS JUST A FOLLOW UP OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- PLEASE GET BACK TO ME BUT I'LL MAKE NOTE AND WHATEVER DISCUSSIONS HAPPENING. AROUND THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I WOULD. BE SURE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND- BECAUSE AS- HOPEFULLY WE RECOGNIZED THROUGH CODED OBVIOUSLY WE'VE UNDERFUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH FOR WAY TOO LONG. WE DON'T AYE COMPOUND THAT AND WE KNOW OUR MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS ARE GOING UP PANDEMIC AS WELL AND WE DON'T WANT TO UNDERCUT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH FUNDING AT THE LOCAL LEVELS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU. OF MOVING ON TO COMMUNICATOR LICENSING. WELCOME HEY GOOD AFTERNOON SHOULD MONETARY CHIEF DEPUTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. NOW I AM GOING TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE YOU JUST AN OVERVIEW FIRST OF COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING AND THEN GO INTO OUR FIRST DIVE BUDGET PROPOSAL. A COMMUNITY CARE LICENSING DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LICENSING OVER SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND FACILITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY OF VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. R. THREE PROGRAM AREAS INCLUDE ADULT AND SENIOR CARE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND CHILD CARE FACILITIES. THE MOST COMMON ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES ARE RCMP'S OR RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY AND A ARE AT OURS OR ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND THOSE ARE FACILITIES THAT SERVE ADULTS AND SENIORS WITH DISABILITIES OR OTHER LONG TERM CARE. AT THE PORTAGE MEAT AND IT'S ALL BE REFERENCING THOSE FACILITIES TODAY OKAY. THE FIRST BUDGET PROPOSAL IS THE ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES CLOSURE AND RESIDENT TRANSFERS AB. TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL ADDRESSES POLICY CHANGES TO BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH ADDRESSES ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITY FOR OUR CLOSURES AND RESIDENT TRANSFERS. PRIOR TO THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ARCS WERE ONLY REQUIRED TO GIVE A THIRTY DAY EVICTION NOTICE TO RESIDENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THEY WERE SPEAKING OPERATIONS. THIS NEW ASSEMBLY BILL REQUIRES ARTISTS TO PROVIDE A ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAY NOTICE OR AS SOON AS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE. TO BOTH CITY AND COUNTIES AS WELL AS TO RESIDENTS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES THEY'RE GOING TO CEASE OPERATIONS. THIS GIVES THE COUNTY OR CITY SIXTY DAYS TO DETERMINE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE OR OPERATE THE FACILITY. WITH THE INTENT OF PRESERVING OVERALL FACILITY CAPACITY. CDSS CURRENTLY HAS THE AUTHORITY UNDER SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE TO APPOINT A TEMPORARY MANAGER TO A FACILITY FOR A LIMITED DURATION IN THE CASE THAT A FACILITY OPERATOR IS UNDER A TEMPORARY SUSPENSION AND CAN NO LONGER FULFILL THEIR DUTIES. THIS ALLOWS RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE TO BE CARED FOR SAFELY ON THEIR HOME REDUCING THE RISK OF TRANSFER TRAUMA EITHER WELL THE NEW OWNER OR PROVIDER TAKES OVER OR LOW RESPONSIBLE PARTIES ARE ABLE TO FIND RESIDENTS NEW HOMES. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN ADDED THE AUTHORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO UTILIZE A TEMPORARY MANAGER IF HERE WAS ANY SUBSTANTIAL THREATS TO HEALTH AND SAFETY. NO ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENTS FOR THE RESIDENTS AND IT WAS NECESSARY TO CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS. THIS CURRENT TEAM WOULD ALLOW THE CDSS TO CONTRACT WITH THE TEMPORARY MANAGERS FOR THIS PURPOSE. THE FUNDING WILL BE USED TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY IF THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE FORMER LICENSEES ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CARE AND SUPERVISION AND A NEW PROVIDER TAKING ON OPERATIONS OF THE FACILITY. WE'RE CURRENTLY ESTIMATING THAT TEN FACILITIES WILL REQUIRE TEMPORARY MANAGERS TO STAY OPEN FOR THE REQUIRED SIXTY DAYS UNDER AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN. THE SECOND QUESTION IF THE DEPARTMENT HAS INDICATED THAT THE REQUESTED RESOURCES MAY HELP SLOW DOWN THE CURRENT TREND OF HIGHER FACILITY CLOSURES ACROSS THE STATE. HOW MANY OF THESE DISABILITY TYPES OF CLOTHES IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. AND HOW MANY FACILITIES DOES THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATE WILL NEED. A TEMPORARY MANAGERS. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE ARCS HAVE CLOSED THEIR DOORS. BEYOND THE OVERALL NUMBER OF OUR FACILITIES THAT HAVE CLOSED FOR ALL ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN THAT WE ARE SEEING IN OUR DATA BUT THE NUMBER OF SSI RECIPIENTS WERE LOW INCOME RECIPIENTS BEING SERVED IN OUR LICENSED FACILITIES IS DECLINING. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS WITH OUR DATA THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DRILL DOWN ON OVERTIME HOWEVER WE MUST ALSO CAN CURRENTLY PLAN TO BUILD OUT THE CONTINUUM OF LONG TERM CARE OPTIONS. FOR AGING ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES OF ALL. ONE INTENT OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY SEVEN WAS TO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS THE FACILITIES THAT SERVE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. HAVING TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS DUE TO FINANCIAL INSOLVENCY AND THEREBY LOSING THE CAPACITY TO SERVE THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE ARE ESTIMATING THAT TEN FACILITIES ANNUALLY. WILL REQUIRE TEMPORARY MANAGERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE AND SUPERVISION DURING OWNERSHIP TRANSITION. AND THE THIRD QUESTION IS A TEMPORARY MANAGER NEEDED IN EVERY INSTANCE. IN WHICH A FACILITY IS TRANSFERRED FROM ONE LICENSEE TO ANOTHER. AND IN WHICH SITUATIONS IS A TEMPORARY MANAGER NECESSARY. HOW DOES THIS MODEL WORK WITH RCMP. AND THE ANSWER IS NO TEMPORARY MANAGERS. THEIR USE MOST TYPICALLY WHEN THE TEMPORARY SUSPENSION ACTION BY THE DEPARTMENT AND IN ALL CASES WHEN THE IN THE MEDIA AT RELOCATION OF THE RESIDENTS IT'S NOT FEASIBLE BASED ON THINGS SUCH AS RISK OF TRANSFER THOMAS LACK OF ALTERNATE PLACEMENTS OR OTHER EMERGENCY CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS. OR WHEN THE LICENSEE IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO ENSURE THE STATE RELOCATION. DURING THE PANDEMIC TEMPORARY MANAGERS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED TO TIMES WHEN THE ADMINISTRATOR CONSCIOUS CONTRACTED PUBLIC NINETEEN A COULD NOT CARE FOR THE RESIDENTS. AND FINALLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE LICENSEE MAY PASS AWAY OR FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY THE DEPARTMENT MAY APPOINT A TEMPORARY MANAGER TO ENSURE THE FACILITY CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND RESIDENTS ARE CARED FOR. IN SITUATIONS IN THE SITUATIONS I'VE DESCRIBED THE DEPARTMENT HAS CONTRACTED WITH TEMPORARY MANAGERS AND BOTH ARE AN RCMP AND I FOUND THEM TO BE INSTRUMENTAL IN ENSURING UNINTERRUPTED KAREN SUPERVISION FOR VULNERABLE FRANCE. AND THE FINAL QUESTION IN THIS SECTION ADVOCATES INSTEAD THAT THE FACILITIES THAT CARE FOR CLIENTS ON SSI ARE STRUGGLING TO COVER OPERATING COSTS. HOW DOES THE STATE PROPOSED TO ENSURE THESE FACILITIES REMAIN OPEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL STRATEGIES THE STATE COULD CONSIDER TO ENSURE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ARCS AND RCOG. ONE SUCH PROGRAM IS THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. THIS PROGRAM WOULD PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD TO COUNTIES FOR THE ACQUISITION OR REHABILITATION OF OURS AND OUR CFE. THE GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO CREATE NEW CARE FACILITIES SECOND. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH A FOCUS ON SENIORS AND THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AS WELL AS TO STABILIZE EXISTING SETTINGS THIRTY PEOPLE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS DUE TO THEIR LIMITED INCOME. FANS WILL BE PRIORITIZED FOR THE CREATION OF NEW AND EXPANDED SETTINGS BUT MAY ALSO BE USED TO FUND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN REHABILITATION COSTS FOR EXISTING SETTINGS AT RISK OF CLOSURE. THIS PROPOSAL AIMS TO LEVERAGE OTHER INVESTMENTS SUCH AS FEDERAL AND LOCAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT OPERATING COSTS AND SERVICES TO RESIDENTS BY REDUCING THE CAPITAL COSTS FOR FACILITY OPERATORS. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING ON THIS ONE. BELIAU. IN SHORT GOOD AFTERNOON ANGELES SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- JUST TO SAY THIS PROPOSAL ALIGNS WITH CURRENT LAW AND AS YOU HEARD WOULD- BRING THE CLOSURE PROCESS FOR OUR MORE IN LINE WITH THE CLOSURE PROCESS THAT PARTY EXISTS FOR RCMP'S- AS SUCH WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS- WITH THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GUESS I WOULD JUST ASK THEM- THE- TO DO WE DO WE KNOW THESE FOR ARE GOING ON ONE IS FOR CLOSE. AND THEN. IS THAT WHAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS WIFE FACILITIES CLOSES BECAUSE OF CAPITAL COSTS. OFTEN PUT MONEY IN THE CAPITAL COST IS THAT WHY THEY'RE CLOSING OR IT. THEY WERE THERE OTHER REASONS. YES SO I'LL TAKE THE- FIRST OF BAD OF INFLUENCE JUST FURTHER THAT. CURRENTLY HAVE SOME PRETTY. LIMITATION WITH OUR- INTO OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE A RESIDENTS TRANSFER AS A RESULT A LOT OF WHAT WE HAVE IS- ANECDOTAL DATA. THAT RESIDENTS ARE HAVING TO FIND OTHER OTHER SITUATIONS OTHER LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES. ON WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE DATA AS I REFERENCED IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE. A NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT ACCEPT AS BEST I RESIDENTS WE ARE SEEN A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SSI RESIDENTS UTILIZING FACILITIES. SO WE CURRENTLY ARE INTERESTED IN DOING SOME ORGANIC DATA EXPLORATION ABOUT THAT BUT YOU HAVE TO HM I CAN'T FULLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND ARE THEY USING THEM. LESS BECAUSE THEY. THINK THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS. ARE THESE THEM LESS RIGHT YOU SHOULD DON'T HAVE ACCESS- AT NIGHT I DON'T KNOW I CAN IN THAT- THAT COULD. SPECIFICALLY BUT SOMETHING I CAN SIR GET SOME GET OKAY INFORMATION AND IF WE END OF WEIRD. IN ORDER TO FUNDING THE SAID RHONDA- WE GOT TO MAKE PEOPLE CAN FIND THE FROM DOOR FOR FIRST. AND THAT PROCESS. AND WHAT WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR THE DATA THAT WE CAN OUR- SO. WE NEVER CAN TRACK PEOPLE ARE GOING AND WHY DO WE- YEAH. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SO THE I CAN. CARELESS PRO- A IN PROCESS OF THE- A NEW DATA. AND WE ARE SO. LOOKING AT STRATEGIES AN AVENUE FOR A TO BE A TO CALL MORE DATA AT THIS. WORK PRIMARILY. WITH THE LADY LOW DATA. BUT THERE'S NO SUCH. OR RIGHT. THAT ALLOWS US TO DIG FURTHER ANKLE. FOR ON. THE- THE ACTUAL RESTED AND SO. WE ARE. AT HOW ARE SYSTEM AND HOW ARE. TO SO CO FRIENDS WITH OUT- WE'VE LEARNED SOME STRAY. FOR BEING A TO OUR READ MORE. TO OUR FACILITIES AND THOSE OF THOSE INCLUDED. THE USE OF AT EVERYBODY IN ORDER TO. SO AND SERVE ON SURVEYS AND SO WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW STRATEGIES FOR BEING ABLE TO COLLECT DATA BUT AT THIS TIME. WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME- LIMITATIONS AS I REFERENCED AND NOT SO. WE WILL DEFINITELY BE LOOKING. BACK WITH YOU AS WE LEARN MORE. I THINK THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE NEED TO VOTE ON FOR THE SHOW NET AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED PEOPLE IN THE SLIPPED TO THE NET THAT'S PROBLEM. DR GRANT. I THINK OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THINK WE CAN. ON TO ISSUE A FIVE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AND REDUCING. LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU. NOW I WILL TAKE THIS NEXT ONE CHICAGO. AND CHIEF DEPUTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- THIS EASY P. IS REQUESTING PERMANENT FUNDING POSITION OF AUTHORITY FOR THREE LICENSING PROGRAM AND ARCHER RESIDENTIAL. TO PERFORM THE MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS OUTLINED IN EIGHTY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT WITH CHILDREN RESIDING IN THEIR CARE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENSURING YEAR AND FOSTER CARE ARE NEITHER BEING ARRESTED OR HAVING CHARGES FILED AGAINST THEM DUE TO MINOR INCIDENTS. THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY RECEIVES OVER THIRTY THOUSAND LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACTS PER YEAR FROM OUR EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY FACILITIES. WE CURRENTLY HAVE A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY FIVE THOUSAND LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT REPORTS TO CROSS THAT. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN CDSS RECEIVED THREE LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO PERFORM THIS WORK LOWER. EAST POSITIONS WILL BE NECESSARY IN AN ONGOING WAY TO BOTH MEET THE WORKLOAD DEMANDS A BABY THREE EIGHTY EIGHT AS WELL AS THE EXPANDED SCOPE OF THE REQUIREMENTS. FOLLOWING AB FOR- OH FOUR IN EIGHTEEN ELEVEN. SECOND QUESTION IS HOW IS THE INCREASED REVIEW AND MONITORING OF THESE FACILITIES FAMILIES. WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF OVERALL BENEFITS TO YOU EXPLAINS WE'VE INCREASED THE MONITORING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT. PROVIDERS HAVE BECOME MORE AWARE OF THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF UNNECESSARY AND SOMETIMES DRAMATIC INTERVENTION BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SUCH AS RE TRUMPETED STATION DUE TO THE YOUTH FAMILY HISTORY WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR THE YOU'RE GETTING A CRIMINAL RECORD WHICH MAY IMPACT THEIR ABILITY LATER TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT OR HOUSING OPTIONS. AS A RESULT OF THIS AWARENESS MANY PROVIDERS HAVE CREATED INTERNAL POLICIES AND TRAINING THAT EIGHT STEP IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION. THE ESCALATION STRATEGIES AND BEHAVIORAL MANAGEMENT SKILLS. SUCH AS CRISIS PREVENTION INSTITUTE TRAINING. DISTILLS AND KNOWLEDGE THAT IN TURN NOT ONLY LEAD TO INCREASE SAFETY FOR YOUTH IN CARE BUT SAFER ENVIRONMENTS FOR THE FACILITIES STAFF AS WELL. AND THE THIRD QUESTION IS WHAT ARE THE REASONS FOR INCREASED LAW ENFORCEMENT REPORTS AND MOST FACILITIES. THE VAST MAJORITY OR 82% OF LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS ARE FOR YOUTH WHO HAVE LEFT THE FACILITY FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT THE APPROVAL TO DO SO. MOST PLACEMENT AGENCIES REQUIRE THAT FACILITIES CONTACT LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THE U. BECAUSE BEEN GONE FOR OVER FIFTEEN MINUTES. WITHOUT APPROVAL. EVEN IF YOU HAS RETURNED TO THESE FACILITIES WE HAVE. EVEN EVEN WHEN THE YEAR HAS RETURNED TO THIS FACILITIES. FIFTY AN OVERALL DEEP FROM COURSE BEING FOR. ISSUES LIK DO TO AN IN EMPHASIS ON TRAINING FOR THE STAFF INCLUDING AS A REFERENCE DE ESCALATION STRATEGIES AND OTHER TRAUMA INFORMED PRACTICE. WHEN WE DO IDENTIFY FACILITIES THAT ARE CALLING ON MORE FREQUENT OUR TEAM PROVIDES INCREASED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT OTHER STRATEGIES. THAT SUPPORT THE. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS- HELLO. SURE THANK YOU AS YOU HEARD THIS PROPOSAL WOULD CONTINUE PROVIDING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS US YOU SALES INCREASED WORKLOAD AROUND- THE PROCESSING AND REPORTING THAT'S REQUIRED- WHEN CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES HAVE CONTACT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- AND AS SUCH GIVEN THIS INCREASED WORKLOAD THAT THEY'VE SEEN OVER RECENT YEARS WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE CONTINUATION OF THE POSITIONS HAPPY TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU A DOCTOR. THIS IS A ASSEMBLY WHO'S WORKING FAMILIES WITH AND IT IS A TOUGH ISSUE. DONNA OKAY- COMMITTEE LICENSING. MEMBERS THANK THANK YOU SHE LONGER TERRY CHIEF DEPUTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES PLEASE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL AND SOME OF THE METHODS THAT CCL HAS USED TO REDUCE TIME TO PROCESS APPLICATIONS. NO WE ARE CURRENTLY REQUESTING PERMANENT POSITION OF AUTHORITY TO ADDRESS THE TIMELINESS AND PROCESSING APPLICATIONS FOR ADULT AND SENIOR RESIDENTIAL CARE PROGRAM AS WELL AS TO ASSIST WITH COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS FOR BOTH THE ADULT AND SENIOR RESIDENTIAL CARE PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE CHILDREN'S RESIDENTIAL CARE. THE DEPARTMENT REQUEST TO MAKE THIRTEEN LICENSING PROGRAM ANALYST AND FOR ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST PERMANENT. IN ORDER TO INCREASE EFFICIENCIES ON THE LICENSING APPLICATION PROCESS THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING THE FOLLOWING STEPS. FIRST WE'RE MAKING BETTER USE OF OUR DATA TO IDENTIFY APPLICATION PROCESS TRENDS WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO FOCUS ON AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO IMPROVE. WE HAVE CREATED EFFICIENCIES REMOVING SOME UP ELECTRONIC PROCESS THESE INCLUDING ITEMS SUCH AS GENERATING AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATIONS TO REQUEST FIRE FOR LOCAL PLANNING INSPECTIONS. AND ACCEPT ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES AND DOCUMENTS. WE RE DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOW TO SPECIALIZED TEAMS TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE TO PROCESS MORE COMPLEX. AND REDUCE PROCESSING TIME. WE HAVE ENHANCED OUR PEER WHEN A CALL LEGAL AND POLICY SUPPORT FOR COMPLEX APPLICATION REQUESTS AND PROCESS THESE. AND WE HAVE INITIATED A STREAMLINED ONBOARDING PROCESS FOR NEW APPLICANTS TO ENSURE MORE COMPLETE APPLICATIONS ARE BEING SUBMITTED AT THE OUTSET. PLEASE DISCUSS THE SEALS APPROACH TO FACILITIES WITH A HIGH NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS. THAT'S COMPLAINTS COME TO OUR TEAM THE CCL ASSESSES THE NATURE AND IMPACT OF THE COMPLAINTS AND THE IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY NEEDS OF RESIDENTS WHICH GUIDES OUR NEXT STEP- NON EGREGIOUS COMPLAINTS ARE TEAM GATHERS MORE INFORMATION TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THOSE. PLANS AND COORDINATES A MEETING WITH THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR AND STAFF TO IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS. WE CONDUCT EARNED GREEN BUSINESS AND WE PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FACILITY IN MEETING REGULATIONS AND PREVENTING FUTURE COMPLAINTS. FOR MORE AGREE JUST COMPLAINTS OUR TEAM RECESSES HEALTH OR SAFETY CONCERNS FOR THE RESIDENTS AS WELL AS IMMEDIACY UP THE REST. BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE COMPLAINT WE DETERMINE IF WE CAN PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND INCREASE OUR MONITORING TO HELP CORRECT THE ISSUE OR IF WE NEED TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. IF PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS FOUND TO BE INEFFECTIVE AND IF THE COMPLAINT RISES TO A CERTAIN LEVEL OF EGREGIOUS MASS. RIDGE THEIR ONGOING RISKS TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE RESIDENTS. IN CCL IN OUR DEPARTMENT'S LEGAL TEAM. TAKE ON IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND STATUTES MAY TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION. AND MAY RESULT A LICENSE IF WE ARE REVOKING A LICENSE THE DEPARTMENT WORKS DILIGENTLY TO ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE PROPERLY CARED FOR DURING THAT STRETCH.
