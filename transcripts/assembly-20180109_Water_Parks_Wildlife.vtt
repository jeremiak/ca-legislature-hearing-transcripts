THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE A

CURRENT STATUTE WITH RESPECT TO

YEAH OUR.

00:29:00.806 --> 00:29:04.710 region:rollup2

CITY COUNCIL WHEN IT PASSES A

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:09.281 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION.

00:29:06.612 --> 00:29:10.882 region:rollup2
THAT STATES INTO THAT IT IS NOT

00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:12.150 region:rollup2
IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO

00:29:10.882 --> 00:29:13.018 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO OWN AND OPERATE A

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.886 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEM.

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:16.588 region:rollup2
IT'S FAILING.

00:29:14.886 --> 00:29:17.990 region:rollup2
AND THAT CITY COUNCIL

00:29:16.588 --> 00:29:20.492 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS A HUNDRED PERCENT OF

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:22.461 region:rollup2
THE ELECTORATE. IT DOESN'T IT

00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:24.730 region:rollup2
REALLY OBVIATES THE NEED FOR A

00:29:22.461 --> 00:29:25.297 region:rollup2

FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR THE COST

00:29:30.235 --> 00:29:33.705 region:rollup2

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:35.307 region:rollup2
IS REAL MONEY IN A GOOD THEY'LL

THE OF ITS MONEY THAT CAN BE. A

00:29:35.307 --> 00:29:40.178 region:rollup2
BETTER USE FOR OTHER.

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:42.314 region:rollup2
OTHER ACTIVITIES.

THEY'VE SAID I JUST WANT TO

00:29:44.349 --> 00:29:46.652 region:rollup2
EMPHASIZE OF WHAT.

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:49.054 region:rollup2
AB GO TO SEVENTY TWO DOES IT

00:29:46.652 --> 00:29:49.988 region:rollup2
PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS.

00:29:49.054 --> 00:29:50.956 region:rollup2
TO SETTLE WATER SYSTEM THAT

00:29:49.988 --> 00:29:52.357 region:rollup2
GIVES THE RESIDENTS OF THE

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:54.760 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES

00:29:52.357 --> 00:29:56.561 region:rollup2
TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS THERE

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.196 region:rollup2
IS STILL A VERY ROBUST. PUBLIC

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:59.665 region:rollup2
PROCESS INVOLVED HERE.

00:29:58.196 --> 00:30:01.333 region:rollup2
REQUIRES PUBLIC HEARINGS PUBLIC

00:29:59.665 --> 00:30:02.567 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATIONS

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:04.736 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC MEETING TO ENSURE THAT

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT THE

00:30:04.736 --> 00:30:08.273 region:rollup2
STATE OF THE WATER UTILITY.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:09.841 region:rollup2
OF THE BILL IS NARROW IN SCOPE

00:30:08.273 --> 00:30:10.809 region:rollup2
AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO SMALL

00:30:09.841 --> 00:30:12.978 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT'S THIRTY THREE

00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:15.080 region:rollup2
HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS ARE

00:30:12.978 --> 00:30:16.581 region:rollup2
LEFT STORY ARE POPULATION OF A.

00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.949 region:rollup2
TEN THOUSAND OR LESS.

00:30:16.581 --> 00:30:19.785 region:rollup2
THAT HAS AN ONGOING PROBLEM

00:30:17.949 --> 00:30:21.953 region:rollup2
WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LACK

00:30:19.785 --> 00:30:23.121 region:rollup2
OF CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT ALL OF

00:30:21.953 --> 00:30:24.423 region:rollup2
THE AND NEEDS I MENTIONED

00:30:23.121 --> 00:30:26.091 region:rollup2
EARLIER.

00:30:24.423 --> 00:30:27.459 region:rollup2
IT PROTECTS CUSTOMERS BY

00:30:26.091 --> 00:30:28.660 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT THE ACQUIRED WATER

00:30:27.459 --> 00:30:30.796 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.831 region:rollup2
WATER RATES.

00:30:30.796 --> 00:30:34.466 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE OF

00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:36.001 region:rollup2
THE CUSTOMERS OF THE WIRING

00:30:34.466 --> 00:30:39.504 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:30:36.001 --> 00:30:39.905 region:rollup2
SO THEY'LL BE ALTOGETHER.

00:30:39.504 --> 00:30:42.174 region:rollup2
THAT'S IMPORTANT A

00:30:39.905 --> 00:30:44.543 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION.

00:30:42.174 --> 00:30:45.911 region:rollup2

INCREASE.

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:02.661 region:rollup2
EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT THE BILL

00:31:00.225 --> 00:31:04.396 region:rollup2
DOES NOT MANDATE ANYTHING IT

00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:06.031 region:rollup2
MERELY FACILITATES BUT VOLUNTARY

00:31:04.396 --> 00:31:07.666 region:rollup2
CONSOLIDATION. WHERE THERE ARE

00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:09.034 region:rollup2
WILLING PARTIES

00:31:07.666 --> 00:31:10.535 region:rollup2
THE BILL DOES NOT DECREASE

00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:12.304 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IN FACT IT PROVIDES

00:31:10.535 --> 00:31:13.505 region:rollup2

00:31:17.109 --> 00:31:21.346 region:rollup2
SUPERSEDE THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:53.832 region:rollup2
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF RECENT.

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.432 region:rollup2
IT RECENTLY THAT HAVE A FAILED

00:33:53.832 --> 00:33:54.666 region:rollup2
THERE I BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT

00:33:54.432 --> 00:33:55.734 region:rollup2
NINETY.

00:33:54.666 --> 00:33:58.136 region:rollup2
ATTENTIONAL.

00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:59.571 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS BILL AT

00:33:58.136 --> 00:34:00.939 region:rollup2
LEAST

00:33:59.571 --> 00:34:02.173 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT EVEN NOTIFIED

00:34:00.939 --> 00:34:03.675 region:rollup2
DEFINED IN THE PARAMETERS THAT

00:34:02.173 --> 00:34:04.109 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE A RIGHT AND THOUSAND

00:34:03.675 --> 00:34:06.111 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON SO FORTH.

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:07.846 region:rollup2
.

00:34:06.111 --> 00:34:08.847 region:rollup2
WITH NO SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF

00:34:07.846 --> 00:34:10.081 region:rollup2
HOW MANY ACTUALLY WANT TO SELL

00:34:08.847 --> 00:34:11.550 region:rollup2
ARE KIND OF THE DIRE STRAITS

00:34:10.081 --> 00:34:12.717 region:rollup2
YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT NO EXTENT

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.019 region:rollup2
DEBATE IT'S ATTEMPTED AND FAILED

00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:15.720 region:rollup2
AT THE BALLOT RIGHT IT'S EVEN

00:34:14.019 --> 00:34:16.922 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR US TO. ASCERTAIN

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.189 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE.

00:34:16.922 --> 00:34:20.325 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S SOME OF THE

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:21.660 region:rollup2
CITIES ARE. ARE INTIMIDATED BY

00:34:20.325 --> 00:34:23.128 region:rollup2
THE LAW AND BILL IN MAY AND MAY

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:24.496 region:rollup2
NOT EVEN WANT TO MOVE. FORWARD

00:34:23.128 --> 00:34:26.865 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:34:24.496 --> 00:34:28.033 region:rollup2
HURDLE LITTLE BEES SO WE'RE

00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:28.900 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY NOT SURE.

00:34:28.033 --> 00:34:30.135 region:rollup2
ON THAT WE'VE WE'VE DONE A

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.070 region:rollup2
LITTLE RESEARCH TRY TO FIGURE

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:33.672 region:rollup2
THAT QUESTION NOW.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:34.806 region:rollup2
PIPE AYE.

00:34:33.672 --> 00:34:36.441 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE IT WILL IF THIS BILL

00:34:34.806 --> 00:34:38.209 region:rollup2
PASSES WILL BE.

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.277 region:rollup2
OF THE BEING OF A A SIGNIFICANT

00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:41.746 region:rollup2
UPTICK.

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:42.714 region:rollup2
IN THOSE A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:44.449 region:rollup2
LIKE I THINK IT WOULD STRAIN THE

00:34:42.714 --> 00:34:45.283 region:rollup2
CASE FOR THE LEGISLATION IF

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:47.552 region:rollup2
THERE WERE MORE NUMBERS ATTACHED

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:49.187 region:rollup2
TO. HOW FREQUENTLY THESE

00:34:47.552 --> 00:34:51.489 region:rollup2
IMPOVERISHED AND AND DIFFICULT

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:53.158 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEMS ARE UNABLE TO SO

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.192 region:rollup2
TO SEEK THE RELIEF THAT

00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:54.726 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS FROM THE COUNTY TO

00:34:54.192 --> 00:34:57.963 region:rollup2
SKILLED DOCTOR WAS TALKING

00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:58.763 region:rollup2
ABOUT?

00:34:57.963 --> 00:34:59.431 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M HAPPIEST WITH THE

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.098 region:rollup2
BILL THE DAVE I THINK THAT WOULD

00:34:59.431 --> 00:35:00.765 region:rollup2
STRENGTHEN THE CASE FOR

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.399 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT PROBLEM WE'RE

00:35:00.765 --> 00:35:02.634 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE HOW SIGNIFICANT

00:35:01.399 --> 00:35:04.235 region:rollup2
PALM THAT REALLY IS. THE OTHER

00:35:02.634 --> 00:35:05.904 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS I GENERALLY HAVE A

00:35:04.235 --> 00:35:06.738 region:rollup2
CONCERN ABOUT EVER.

00:35:05.904 --> 00:35:08.373 region:rollup2
A POTENTIALLY SIGNED OFF PUBLIC

00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:09.574 region:rollup2
ASSETS I'M NOT DON'T BELIEVE

00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:10.508 region:rollup2
THIS BILL SPEAKS TO A

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.843 region:rollup2
PROHIBITION TO SELLING TO

00:35:10.508 --> 00:35:14.646 region:rollup2
PRIVATE ENTITIES THIS IS SIMPLY

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:16.481 region:rollup2
GOING TO OTHER. PUBLIC AGENCIES

00:35:14.646 --> 00:35:17.816 region:rollup2
RIGHT THANKS TO ITS NOT LET'S.

00:35:16.481 --> 00:35:20.218 region:rollup2
IT'S ANYBODY IT'S ANY

00:35:17.816 --> 00:35:22.854 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORING SYSTEM NAMING SYSTEM

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:24.189 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SYSTEM I'D ANY THE WATERS

00:35:22.854 --> 00:35:25.757 region:rollup2
IT WHAT COMMUNITY YOU CAN BE

00:35:24.189 --> 00:35:26.424 region:rollup2
BETWEEN EITHER BY. THE BEYOND

00:35:25.757 --> 00:35:27.058 region:rollup2
ALSO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE IS

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:29.361 region:rollup2
THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE THE%

00:35:27.058 --> 00:35:29.694 region:rollup2
SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS TO PRIVATE

00:35:29.361 --> 00:35:32.430 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:33.665 region:rollup2
OR.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.132 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC WILL HIT A RECORD OF

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:35.533 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNMENT OWNS IT

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:36.768 region:rollup2
AS WELL.

00:35:35.533 --> 00:35:37.702 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT ALSO PROBABLY

00:35:36.768 --> 00:35:38.603 region:rollup2
REQUIRE STATUS OF DIGITAL

00:35:37.702 --> 00:35:39.571 region:rollup2
VETTING PARTICULARLY.

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.572 region:rollup2
NAVICULAR MY OWN CITY THESE ARE

00:35:39.571 --> 00:35:41.640 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY PRETTY GOOD JOBS.

00:35:40.572 --> 00:35:43.541 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.476 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE USUALLY PRE

00:35:43.541 --> 00:35:45.510 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT MAYBE NOT SO MUCH IN

00:35:44.476 --> 00:35:46.811 region:rollup2
THE CASE OF THE SMALL

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:47.812 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THEIR PROPS

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:50.148 region:rollup2
TEETERING ON FINANCIAL.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.915 region:rollup2
SPORTIMES BUT NOT UNDERSTANDING

00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:52.751 region:rollup2
THAT AGAIN AND UNDERSERVED

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.618 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING WHAT PRIVATIZATION

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:55.987 region:rollup2
MAY MEAN.

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:56.621 region:rollup2
MOST MYSPACE WITHOUT ARE NOT

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.555 region:rollup2
FAVORABLE.

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:58.456 region:rollup2
AND.

00:35:57.555 --> 00:35:59.758 region:rollup2
ANY KIND BILL TO LOOK

00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:01.259 region:rollup2
FACILITATE THAT IN A NEGATIVE

00:35:59.758 --> 00:36:03.228 region:rollup2
WAY YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:04.829 region:rollup2
WHEN BY MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE

00:36:03.228 --> 00:36:06.765 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF TODAY'S

00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:08.633 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS CHAIRMAN I'M HAVE

00:36:06.765 --> 00:36:10.168 region:rollup2
TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATION.

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:11.636 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:13.104 region:rollup2
THIS IN WHICH IS MAKE A PLEA FOR

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:15.607 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO MAKE

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:17.809 region:rollup2
SURE VERY CLEAR.

00:36:15.607 --> 00:36:19.978 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE

00:36:17.809 --> 00:36:21.780 region:rollup2
OFFICIALS MAKING THE DECISION

00:36:19.978 --> 00:36:22.414 region:rollup2
THEY GENERALLY MAKE MOST

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:26.051 region:rollup2
DECISIONS ANYWAY?

00:36:22.414 --> 00:36:28.153 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT I

00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:32.257 region:rollup2
THINK YOU'RE COMMITTEE PERFORMS

00:36:28.153 --> 00:36:32.257 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN OF ABOUT YOU KNOW SORT

00:36:32.323 --> 00:36:38.530 region:rollup2
UNCLEAR ABOUT PUBLIC MEETING

00:36:35.627 --> 00:36:41.733 region:rollup2
THAT EARLY FOR. OUR FOLKS TO

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:44.636 region:rollup2
COME AND MAKE THE COMMENTS KNOWN

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:47.672 region:rollup2
ABBAS AND FEW THOSE HEARINGS

00:36:44.636 --> 00:36:51.743 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS THEIR THEIR.

00:36:47.672 --> 00:36:55.580 region:rollup2
THE PRINT SHALLOW GENE I'M SO

00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:56.214 region:rollup2
TAKE TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW LOW

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.753 region:rollup2
IN THE BOTTOM SO I MEAN AT LEAST

00:36:56.214 --> 00:37:04.522 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING

00:37:01.753 --> 00:37:06.091 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:07.459 region:rollup2
AN ASSET YOU ARE EVEN KNOW WHAT

00:37:06.091 --> 00:37:09.427 region:rollup2
THE CITY OF WILLOW'S WOULD GET.

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:12.564 region:rollup2
FOR SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER WATER

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:14.132 region:rollup2
AND AND NOT NO PUN INTENDED UP

00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.934 region:rollup2
BUT BUT BUT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE

00:37:14.132 --> 00:37:16.835 region:rollup2
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:19.571 region:rollup2
AND AND HAVING TO DEFEND YOUR

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:20.805 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND CONSTANTLY. TO PULL

00:37:19.571 --> 00:37:22.407 region:rollup2
OUT WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE UNITS

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:25.009 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE I SUSPECT YOU HAVE A.

00:37:22.407 --> 00:37:26.311 region:rollup2
OF FUND ALREADY FOR YOUR WATER

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:28.980 region:rollup2
PLANT AND NOW YOU HAVE TO DIP

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:31.249 region:rollup2
INTO THAT. RAISING THE RATES.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.850 region:rollup2
ARE ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND AND

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:34.119 region:rollup2
I ALSO DO.

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:34.953 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:36.688 region:rollup2
OF A CITY.

00:37:34.953 --> 00:37:37.422 region:rollup2
AREN'T TAKING SOMETHING LIKE

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:42.360 region:rollup2
THIS TO THE BALLOT BECAUSE YOU

00:37:37.422 --> 00:37:44.896 region:rollup2
CAN'T REALLY CAMPAIGNED FOR YOUR

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.297 region:rollup2
CASE. SO THAT BECOMES AT BECOMES

00:37:44.896 --> 00:37:48.133 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PROBLEM SO THE FACT THAT

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:50.401 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE PERCENT.

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:53.304 region:rollup2
PROTESTS COULD OVERTURN THIS I

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:54.773 region:rollup2
THINK IS SIGNIFICANT I THINK

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:56.908 region:rollup2
THAT'S A POINT THAT'S ONLY A

00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:58.576 region:rollup2
POINT IN YOUR FAVOR.

00:37:56.908 --> 00:38:01.846 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:37:58.576 --> 00:38:07.685 region:rollup2
BUT I I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:09.154 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IF WILLOW'S WERE TO

00:38:07.685 --> 00:38:10.789 region:rollup2
SELL OFF THEIR ASSET YOU KNOW.

00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:12.390 region:rollup2
IS IT A ZERO SUM GAME OR ARE YOU

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:13.224 region:rollup2
OR DOES THE CITY ACTUALLY.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.693 region:rollup2
GET OUT AT THE STAND TO GET

00:38:13.224 --> 00:38:17.095 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FOR THE FOR THE ASSET.

00:38:15.693 --> 00:38:18.930 region:rollup2
WE HAD AN APPRAISAL DONE

00:38:17.095 --> 00:38:19.931 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY SIX YEARS AGO. AND

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:20.565 region:rollup2
THE APPRAISED VALUE WAS AROUND A

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:21.800 region:rollup2
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:22.834 region:rollup2
DOLLARS AND THAT WAS BEFORE IT

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.002 region:rollup2
WAS IDENTIFIED CHROME SIX.

00:38:22.834 --> 00:38:25.803 region:rollup2
SO AT THIS POINT.

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:27.038 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:27.605 region:rollup2
CONTAMINATED WATER SO THAT'S

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:28.239 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.774 region:rollup2
AND.

00:38:28.239 --> 00:38:31.543 region:rollup2
RAISING RATES OR TREATING THOSE

00:38:29.774 --> 00:38:33.578 region:rollup2
WATERS IS NOT FEASIBLE SPECIALLY

00:38:31.543 --> 00:38:34.746 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'VE ALREADY PLACED. THAT

00:38:33.578 --> 00:38:35.947 region:rollup2
GRAMPUS ON CLOSE TO SEVEN

00:38:34.746 --> 00:38:37.215 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS OF TREATMENT

00:38:35.947 --> 00:38:38.283 region:rollup2
FACILITIES IN WILLOW'S WHEN WE

00:38:37.215 --> 00:38:39.984 region:rollup2
CAN TIE INTO THAT SYSTEM AND AND

00:38:38.283 --> 00:38:41.119 region:rollup2
TREAT AND. PROVIDE THE WATER

00:38:39.984 --> 00:38:41.486 region:rollup2
DOWN TO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S

00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:42.821 region:rollup2
TREATED IN AND.

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:45.290 region:rollup2
.

00:38:42.821 --> 00:38:46.424 region:rollup2
SAFE FOR CUSTOMERS.

00:38:45.290 --> 00:38:47.825 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS I YOU KNOW FOR MY

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:49.594 region:rollup2
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.795 region:rollup2
WHEN I WAS A AND THE COUNCIL

00:38:49.594 --> 00:38:51.896 region:rollup2
MEMBER THE CITY FEELS PER WEEK.

00:38:50.795 --> 00:38:54.032 region:rollup2
WE WERE ARE ARE ONE OF THE FEW

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:54.666 region:rollup2
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I THINK OR

00:38:54.032 --> 00:38:56.301 region:rollup2
ARE THERE THERE PROBABLY QUITE A

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:57.035 region:rollup2
FEW CITIES BUT.

00:38:56.301 --> 00:38:58.536 region:rollup2
A SMALL CITY TWELVE THOUSAND

00:38:57.035 --> 00:38:59.137 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OWN OUR OWN WATER UTILITY

00:38:58.536 --> 00:39:00.238 region:rollup2
OUR OWN ELECTRIC UTILITY R.

00:38:59.137 --> 00:39:02.006 region:rollup2
WASTEWATER UTILITY OF VERY

00:39:00.238 --> 00:39:03.374 region:rollup2
UNUSUAL FOR A SMALL CITY AND I'M

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.475 region:rollup2
WE OFTEN HAD REQUESTS YOU WANT

00:39:03.374 --> 00:39:05.677 region:rollup2
YOU DIVEST YOURSELF OF YOUR OF

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:06.311 region:rollup2
THE ELECTRIC UTILITY. ABOUT AT

YEARS AND YEARS THAT ALL THESE

HASBEEN AT SOME POINT FROM EVEN

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:19.017 region:rollup2

THE AUTHOR ME OF BRINGING THIS

FORWARD AND I THINK THERE IS

00:40:39.804 --> 00:40:42.140 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:43.675 region:rollup2
THAT THIS COULD BE A TOOL BUT

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:45.410 region:rollup2
TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:46.544 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY SMALL AND IN MY

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:47.679 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS.

00:40:46.544 --> 00:40:48.246 region:rollup2
THAT THIS IS REALLY TARGETED

00:40:47.679 --> 00:40:51.449 region:rollup2
TOWARD SMALL.

00:40:48.246 --> 00:40:52.750 region:rollup2
PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS.

00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:53.751 region:rollup2
AND MANY OF. MAY HAD THIS

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.952 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN MY RURAL DISTRICT

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.555 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE.

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:58.122 region:rollup2
NEO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT

00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:59.924 region:rollup2
REALLY DISK CAN'T COVER THE

00:40:58.122 --> 00:41:02.927 region:rollup2
COST.

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:04.529 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEM.

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:06.698 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES IT'S MADE

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:08.232 region:rollup2
SENSE TO YOU KNOW DIE BEST.

00:41:06.698 --> 00:41:11.069 region:rollup2
FROM THEM.

00:41:08.232 --> 00:41:12.704 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY THE CITY OF

00:41:11.069 --> 00:41:14.439 region:rollup2
WILLOW'S IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND

00:41:12.704 --> 00:41:15.573 region:rollup2
I THINK A MR PEABODY FOR COMING

00:41:14.439 --> 00:41:18.242 region:rollup2
DOWN TODAY.

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:18.443 region:rollup2
AND IN TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS

00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.744 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:21.045 region:rollup2
.

00:41:19.744 --> 00:41:22.747 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:24.048 region:rollup2
COULD BE HELPFUL FOR COMMITTEES

00:41:22.747 --> 00:41:25.917 region:rollup2
LIKE WILLOW'S WHERE. YOU KNOW

00:41:24.048 --> 00:41:27.452 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO THIS.

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:29.620 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC SUPPORT

00:41:27.452 --> 00:41:30.221 region:rollup2
FOR. A WHAT I WHAT I THINK ABOUT

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.523 region:rollup2
IS.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:34.492 region:rollup2
.

00:41:32.523 --> 00:41:35.226 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME SITUATIONS

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:36.861 region:rollup2
WHERE.

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:38.730 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO HAVE PROTECTIONS.

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:38.997 region:rollup2
.

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.332 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:42.367 region:rollup2
AND WHERE AND WHERE THE PUBLIC

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:45.169 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE SO.

00:41:42.367 --> 00:41:47.638 region:rollup2
INCLINED TO SUPPORT DIVESTITURE.

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:48.873 region:rollup2
.

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:49.540 region:rollup2
ONE THING I'D LIKE TO SEE AND I

00:41:48.873 --> 00:41:51.576 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:52.643 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED I KNOW WE'VE. I THINK

00:41:51.576 --> 00:41:53.544 region:rollup2
THE COMMITTEE MEMBER IT'S MAKING

00:41:52.643 --> 00:41:54.412 region:rollup2
A TEN DAY PROCESS FOR THE

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:56.514 region:rollup2
PROTEST.

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:57.849 region:rollup2
.

00:41:56.514 --> 00:41:58.916 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WOULD NEED MORE TIME

00:41:57.849 --> 00:42:00.485 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK UNDER PROP.

00:41:58.916 --> 00:42:01.786 region:rollup2
TO EIGHTEEN IT'S A FORTY FIVE

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:04.355 region:rollup2
DAY.

00:42:01.786 --> 00:42:05.990 region:rollup2
PROCESS YOU KNOW FOR THE PUBLIC

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:07.959 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.960 region:rollup2
PROTEST IF THEY NEED TO.

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:10.361 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:11.829 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE WORTH PUTTING IN HERE

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:13.431 region:rollup2
IS NOT JUST THE.

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:14.432 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT

00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:16.267 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE IT TO AN ELECTION.

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:18.269 region:rollup2
.

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:19.537 region:rollup2
BUT PERHAPS THE JUST LIKE TWO

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:21.339 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN IF IF FIFTY PERCENT

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:22.874 region:rollup2
PLUS ONE.

00:42:21.339 --> 00:42:24.776 region:rollup2
THAT COME IN AND THAT FORTY FIVE

00:42:22.874 --> 00:42:26.344 region:rollup2
DAY PERIOD IMP AND PROTEST THE

00:42:24.776 --> 00:42:28.146 region:rollup2
SALE. THAT THE CELL WOULD NOT GO

FORWARD.

00:42:28.146 --> 00:42:31.015 region:rollup2

IS A INTRODUCTION OR RE

00:46:38.763 --> 00:46:41.298 region:rollup2
INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND I

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:42.700 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES

00:46:41.298 --> 00:46:44.635 region:rollup2
FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE NOT MAYBE.

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:47.805 region:rollup2
THIS STILL APPLIES TO ALL STATE

00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:49.774 region:rollup2
PARKS INCLUDING STATE BEACHES.

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:52.376 region:rollup2
YES OF THE THE DIFFERENCE.

00:46:49.774 --> 00:46:54.612 region:rollup2
IS NOT IN THIS BILL BUT IN THE

00:46:52.376 --> 00:46:56.347 region:rollup2
PRIOR VETO THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD

00:46:54.612 --> 00:46:57.915 region:rollup2
WHERE HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW

00:46:56.347 --> 00:46:59.650 region:rollup2
BROAD THE BILL WAS THAT WE ARE

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:01.585 region:rollup2
TRYING TO PROVIDE THE PARKS

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:06.257 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR MORE DISCRETIONON HOW

00:47:01.585 --> 00:47:07.692 region:rollup2
TO. APPLY OR NOT APPLY IT ON.

00:47:06.257 --> 00:47:09.727 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE I PERSONALLY

00:47:07.692 --> 00:47:10.995 region:rollup2
DON'T YOU KNOW.

00:47:09.727 --> 00:47:12.329 region:rollup2
AGREE TOO MUCH WITH THAT TYPE OF

00:47:10.995 --> 00:47:13.698 region:rollup2
LEEWAY BUT THAT.

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:15.199 region:rollup2
PERHAPS FOR GOVERNMENT

00:47:13.698 --> 00:47:17.568 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES THERE

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:19.470 region:rollup2
MAY BE A RATIONALE TO HAVE SOME

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:21.038 region:rollup2
TYPE OF DISCRETION AND SO THAT

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:23.240 region:rollup2
IS IN THE LEGISLATION.

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:24.575 region:rollup2
GOTCHA SO IT COULD APPLY TO

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.711 region:rollup2
EITHER BUT IT'S DISCRETIONARY.

00:47:24.575 --> 00:47:27.578 region:rollup2
AYE THAT'S RIGHT BEYOND DAWN IN

00:47:26.711 --> 00:47:29.847 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:32.550 region:rollup2
OF WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO COVER.

00:47:29.847 --> 00:47:35.686 region:rollup2
IS IT DOES CIGARETTES ONLY IS IT

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:37.421 region:rollup2
CIGARS IS IT VAPING HOW WHAT

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:39.924 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT YOU DOES. IT IS SUCH

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:40.991 region:rollup2
A BROAD UNIVERSE THAT YOU KNOW

00:47:39.924 --> 00:47:42.326 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SAY WHAT IS A SUPPLY TO

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:43.461 region:rollup2
MARIJUANA AND I THINK THAT I

00:47:42.326 --> 00:47:46.297 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT'S TOO NARROW

00:47:43.461 --> 00:47:47.765 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE. INCLUDE WE'D OR

00:47:46.297 --> 00:47:48.299 region:rollup2
OTHER PLANT.

00:47:47.765 --> 00:47:49.834 region:rollup2
AND VAPING AS PART OF THAT

00:47:48.299 --> 00:47:51.569 region:rollup2
OKAY.

00:47:49.834 --> 00:47:54.572 region:rollup2
AND SO IT DOES POTENTIALLY

00:47:51.569 --> 00:47:55.506 region:rollup2
INCLUDE CIGARS ELECT RIGHT.

00:47:54.572 --> 00:47:57.308 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR CLARIFICATION

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:59.510 region:rollup2
APPROACH AGAIN WHICH MIGHT BE SO

00:47:57.308 --> 00:48:00.945 region:rollup2
I PERSONALLY. DON'T.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:02.813 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE I WANT BUT I KNOW THAT

00:48:00.945 --> 00:48:04.482 region:rollup2
FROM A POLICY LEVEL IT MAKES A

00:48:02.813 --> 00:48:06.784 region:rollup2
LOT OF SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:48:04.482 --> 00:48:08.085 region:rollup2
YAK IS ON THE LAST IMAGE YOU'RE

00:48:06.784 --> 00:48:09.286 region:rollup2
INTRODUCED UNITED THAT TRY TO

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:10.955 region:rollup2
DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THE

00:48:09.286 --> 00:48:11.989 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BECAUSE.

00:48:10.955 --> 00:48:12.923 region:rollup2
I SOMETIMES IMPOTENCE FOR

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:14.792 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IS THE

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:17.261 region:rollup2
LETTER QUESTION.

00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:18.796 region:rollup2
I WHICH CIGARS DON'T NECESSARILY

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:20.164 region:rollup2
APPLY TO BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A

00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:22.199 region:rollup2
FILTER SITUACIóN.

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:24.135 region:rollup2
WITH THE CIGARS BECAUSE IT'S

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:25.536 region:rollup2
PRETTY MUCH A BIODEGRADABLE. AYE

00:48:24.135 --> 00:48:26.771 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND HAND

00:48:25.536 --> 00:48:28.539 region:rollup2
SMOKE QUESTIONS SOME PEOPLE HAVE

00:48:26.771 --> 00:48:30.608 region:rollup2
BOTH OF THOSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE

00:48:28.539 --> 00:48:32.943 region:rollup2
ONE OR THE OTHER. AYE AND SO

00:48:30.608 --> 00:48:34.011 region:rollup2

OKAY YEAH A NOT SPECIFICALLY UP

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:44.889 region:rollup2
AT ANY QUESTION BUT I THOUGHT I

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:48.626 region:rollup2
AM A STRONG PROPONENT OF A.

00:48:44.889 --> 00:48:50.728 region:rollup2
SMOKING BAN ASSAULT WHEN ON.

00:48:48.626 --> 00:48:52.830 region:rollup2

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:06.177 region:rollup2
A STUDY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO

00:49:04.375 --> 00:49:08.112 region:rollup2

IT WAS SO UNANIMOUSLY COM

A IN THE CITY OF IRVINE AND THEN

00:49:32.603 --> 00:49:37.475 region:rollup2

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.810 region:rollup2
NOT PRINCIPLE SHOULD APPLY.

00:49:37.475 --> 00:49:42.646 region:rollup2
