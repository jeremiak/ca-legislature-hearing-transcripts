00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.267
NOT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO

00:30:36.334 --> 00:30:37.569
BERATE THEM AND JUST TELL THEM

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:39.003
TO STOP INJECTING WE HAVE TO DO

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:41.072
THE HARD WORK TO GET THEM IN

00:30:41.139 --> 00:30:42.874
THE RECOVERY- BUT IF WE HAVE A

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:44.142
CHOICE WHICH IS WHAT THE

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:46.110

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:00.692
MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST WANNA BE

00:31:00.758 --> 00:31:02.727
SURE THAT- WHAT HE SAID WAS

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.529
UNDERSTOOD CLEARLY- FIRST OF

00:31:04.596 --> 00:31:06.164
ALL THIS IS ABOUT REDUCTION IN

00:31:06.231 --> 00:31:07.498
THE SPREAD OF HIV AND HEPATITIS

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:10.335
C. BOTH WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:10.969
DISEASES OF SOMEONE TAXES THAT

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:11.502
THEY CAN GIVE IT TO OTHER

00:31:11.569 --> 00:31:13.071
PEOPLE. SECOND MIGHT STILL WANT

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:14.138
TO BE CLEAR THAT THE EVIDENCE

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.140
SHOWS THERE'S NO INCREASE IN

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:17.542
CRIME SO I APPRECIATE THE

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:19.444
POINTING OUT ABOUT CRIME AND

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.212
DECREASING BUT WHAT DOES DOIS

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:23.081
IT DECREASES THE SPREAD OF

00:31:23.147 --> 00:31:24.983
INFECTION WITHOUT INCREASING

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:26.684
CRIME RATES WITH THAT I THINK

00:31:26.751 --> 00:31:28.119
THAT'S A GOOD COMMON SENSE

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.420
THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:16.646
THINK THAT- JUST LIKE IT WAS-

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:17.914
MICE THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM

PRIVATE BUSINESS- BOARD SHOULD

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.661

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.537

MORE DEATHS OCCUR IN THOSE

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.362
THAT IS NOT FAIR. THAT IS

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.231

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:01.389

FACT THAT THERE'S PEOPLE

01:26:02.524 --> 01:26:03.791
PRACTICING UNDER SUPERVISION

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:06.027
THAT IF THERE ARE ISSUES WITH

THEIR QUALITY PRACTICE. THAT

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:10.865
THAT THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT

01:26:10.932 --> 01:26:13.801
THAT THEY- WOULD BE- THEIR

02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:15.151
WHETHER THEY HAD EXPERIENCE

02:48:15.218 --> 02:48:15.952
WITH THIS YOU KNOW SOUTH

02:48:16.019 --> 02:48:18.621
AFRICAN APARTHEID OR HOLOCAUST

02:48:18.688 --> 02:48:20.423
FOR JAPANESE INTERNMENT

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:22.192
SOMETHING WITHIN THAT BODY OF

02:48:22.258 --> 02:48:25.495
SCHOLARSHIP- WAR CHU MIN RIGHTS

02:48:25.562 --> 02:48:27.997
AMERICAN HISTORY ONE GETTING

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.666
OUT WITH ALL OF THIS IS THAT I

02:48:29.732 --> 02:48:31.668
WAS CONCERNED THAT HAVING SO

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:35.138
MANY LEGISLATIVE APPOINTEES IN

02:48:35.205 --> 02:48:38.408
THE ORIGINAL DRAFT. WOULD DRAG.

02:48:38.475 --> 02:48:40.777
DOWN HIS TASK FORCE AND I WAS

02:48:40.844 --> 02:48:43.179
HOPING THAT WOULD BE ELEVATED.

02:48:43.246 --> 02:48:46.182
TO AN EXPERT LEVEL OF REVIEW BY

02:48:46.249 --> 02:48:47.917
THOSE WHO HAVE A STRONG

02:48:47.984 --> 02:48:50.053
BACKGROUND IN TEAM RELATED

02:48:50.119 --> 02:48:54.824
TOPICS- I HAD WANTED ALSO TO

02:48:54.891 --> 02:48:57.293
PROPERLY REPRESENT THE

02:48:57.360 --> 02:48:59.095
BREAKDOWN OF CALIFORNIA. AND

02:48:59.162 --> 02:49:01.631
EVEN THOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY

02:49:01.698 --> 02:49:03.900
OF FOLKS IN THE LEGISLATURE AND

02:49:03.967 --> 02:49:05.869
ACROSS STATE AFFILIATE WITH THE

02:49:05.935 --> 02:49:07.937
DEMOCRATIC PARTY I THOUGHT IT

02:49:08.004 --> 02:49:10.773
COULD BE HELPFUL IF IT LEADS

02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:12.742
ONE APPOINTING COULD BE FROM

02:49:12.809 --> 02:49:15.612
THE MINORITY LEADERSHIP IN THE

02:49:15.678 --> 02:49:17.413
ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. SO I

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:19.716
PROPOSE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:49:19.782 --> 02:49:22.785
AND ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER- WAS

02:49:22.852 --> 02:49:23.620
GRACIOUS ENOUGH TO WALK THROUGH

02:49:23.686 --> 02:49:25.889
THEM. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:49:25.955 --> 02:49:28.157
THE GOVERNOR STEPPED IN AND HAS

02:49:28.224 --> 02:49:30.460
SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED IT AND

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:32.128
TAKEN A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS

02:49:32.195 --> 02:49:35.965
THAT I THINK ARE ARE HELPFUL-

02:49:36.032 --> 02:49:37.333
HE HAS TAKEN MORE OF THE

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:38.735
APPOINTEES THAT WERE INITIALLY

02:49:38.801 --> 02:49:41.571
A LOT OF. REDUCE THE APPOINTEES

02:49:41.638 --> 02:49:45.375
FROM THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

02:49:45.441 --> 02:49:48.845
AGAIN LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S PUT

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:51.247
A SPECIAL EMPHASIS ON OF THOSE

02:49:51.314 --> 02:49:53.182
HAVING THE ACADEMIC AND

02:49:53.249 --> 02:49:54.017
PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND TO

02:49:54.083 --> 02:49:58.221
ELEVATE. THIS DISCUSSION. I'M A

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:59.422
LITTLE CONCERNED STILL THAT

02:49:59.489 --> 02:50:02.892
THERE IS NOW OPPORTUNITY FOR-

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:05.161
REPUBLICANS TO PARTICIPATE EVEN

02:50:05.228 --> 02:50:08.431
IN AN EMERGENCY REPUBLICANS ARE

02:50:08.498 --> 02:50:11.234
JUST FOLKS THAT ARE APPOINTED

02:50:11.301 --> 02:50:14.938
FROM THE REPUBLICAN- LEADERSHIP

02:50:15.004 --> 02:50:16.172
IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE.

02:50:16.239 --> 02:50:17.941
SO I'M I HAVE SOME HEARTBURN

02:50:18.007 --> 02:50:21.077
HERE I WANT TO SUPPORT THIS BUT

02:50:21.144 --> 02:50:22.412
I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

02:50:22.478 --> 02:50:24.681
SHORTCOMINGS IN THE COMPOSITION

02:50:24.747 --> 02:50:27.917
OF THIS OF THIS- TASK FORCE.

02:50:27.984 --> 02:50:32.889
AND GIVEN MY PAST EXPERIENCE

02:50:32.956 --> 02:50:33.690
WITH YOU KNOW WHAT. BEING

02:50:33.756 --> 02:50:36.826
ADVOCATE FOR OTHER FOLKS I WAS

02:50:36.893 --> 02:50:38.695
HOPING THAT THIS WOULD TO BE

02:50:38.761 --> 02:50:40.930
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BUT I DIDN'T

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:41.431
KNOW IF ANY OF MY OTHER

02:50:41.497 --> 02:50:43.733
COLLEAGUES HAD. FELL THAT THESE

02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:45.034
CHANGES MADE BY THE GOVERNOR

02:50:45.101 --> 02:50:48.071
AND AGREED TO BY THE AUTHOR-

02:50:48.137 --> 02:50:49.372
GOOD EVERYONE IS HAPPY WITH THE

02:50:49.439 --> 02:50:51.374
NEW COMPOSITION- BECAUSE I

02:50:51.441 --> 02:50:52.742
THINK IT STILL HAS SOME

02:50:52.809 --> 02:50:54.944
FUNDAMENTAL SHORTCOMINGS EVEN

02:50:55.011 --> 02:50:56.079
THOUGH I WANT SOMETHING LIKE

02:50:56.145 --> 02:50:58.448
THIS TO SUCCEED. AND NONE OF

02:50:58.514 --> 02:51:01.250
THIS OF COURSE IS. OUR BINDING

02:51:01.317 --> 02:51:03.987
US TO WHATEVER THE OUTCOME OF

02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:05.655
THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:51:05.722 --> 02:51:06.789
ARE THAT WOULD HAVE TO GO

02:51:06.856 --> 02:51:08.758
THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE L. AS

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:11.861
WE KNOW IT SO WE'RE NOT VOTING

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.296

DO KNOW THAT IN MY COLLEAGUES

02:51:16.566 --> 02:51:17.667
HAD CONCERNS ABOUT THE

02:51:17.734 --> 02:51:19.202
COMPOSITION BECAUSE I THINK. IF

02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:21.404
YOU WANT TO DO IT RIGHT AND YOU

02:51:21.471 --> 02:51:24.774

ACROSS THE UNITED STATES I

02:51:30.013 --> 02:51:31.547
BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:51:31.614 --> 02:51:34.384
CERTAIN BOXES CHECKED. AND DID

02:51:34.450 --> 02:51:36.152
THE CURRENT COMPOSITION FALLS

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:40.189
JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT IN MY

BRODERICK ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S

02:52:23.199 --> 02:52:26.936
FIRST US SENATORS. AND THE

02:52:43.386 --> 02:52:45.121
WASHINGTON DC HE WAS VERY

02:52:45.188 --> 02:52:47.090
PASSIONATE. THATCALIFORNIA

02:52:47.156 --> 02:52:51.260
