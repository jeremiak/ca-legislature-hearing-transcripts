GREAT AND AS EVERYONE KNOWS FROM. THERE ARE PROBABLY TOO MANY GUNS AND TOO MANY. PEOPLE'S HANDS WHO SHOULD NEVER PROBABLY EVER HAVE GUNNED DATA FROM THE LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOWED THAT PORN SIX FIVE PEOPLE WERE SHOT IN THE CITY BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY OF THIS YEAR- THAT IS A SIXTY SEVEN. PERCENT INCREASE FROM THE SAME TIME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THERE WERE A HUNDRED FIFTEEN HOMICIDES DURING A TIME WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF 26% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AND SOME OF THE DATA THAT'S COME OUT OF LOS ANGELES. MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN AND SO IS IT BEHOOVES US- THAT POST THIS POST PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO- AND SO WE REALLY DO IF WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR BOYS IN A COLOR. BOB THIS YEAR WE NEED TO INFUSE STICK CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. CALVET WITH A LARGE SUM OF WE DID PUT IN MONEY FOR A LARGE SUM TO FUND THE WORK THAT WE SO DESPERATELY NEED TO GET. NOW THE GUNS OFF THE STREET BUT OUT OF THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM- SO. WE MAY BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST SPEAKER SO. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT. ELECTRONICALLY PUT. GO FOR IT. I HAVE TO TRUST SOMEONE ELSE. I BELIEVE IT'S MAY HELP YOU CAN HEAR ME MISTER CHAIR AND THIS IS MIKE MAKE LIVELY AND IT'S ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M THE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT CONFIRMS WHERE NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ORGANIZATION AND- BUT BASICALLY IT'S PARTIALLY- CALIFORNIA BUT WORKING IN THE STATE FOR MANY YEARS. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO HOMICIDES AND SHOOTINGS AMERICA'S GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT AS YOU WERE SAYING ON YOUNG MEN AND BOYS OF COLOR- BUT YOU OFTEN ARE POLICY CONVERSATIONS AND SOLUTIONS FAILED TO REFLECT THAT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA 75% OF HOMICIDE VICTIMS ARE BLACK IN LATIN NEXT PEOPLE WITH MOST AS YOU SPEND BEING MALE AND HOMICIDE IS IN FACT THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG BLACK MEN IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH FOR YOUNG LATINO MEN AND FOR EXTRA CONTEXT NEARLY AS MANY CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR LIVES JUST LAST YEAR. AS U. S. SOLDIERS DEAD- DURING THE ENTIRE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES SO COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IS AN INCREDIBLY PRESSING DAILY ISSUE INOUR STATE AND WE REALLY THANK YOU FOR POSTING THIS ANALYSTS TO DISCUSS SOLUTIONS AND WHAT THE STATE CAN DO BETTER TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AS YOU SAID WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT HOMICIDE IN BOUNCING CALIFORNIA WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT GUNS THREE QUARTERS OF HOMICIDES IN THE STATE ARE COMMITTED WITH A GUN AND CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO REGULATING ACCESS TO GUNS AND GUN SAFETY LAWS I'VE BEEN THERE A FEW OTHER SOLUTIONS THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE AT THE SAME TIME THE FIRST IS BROADER AND INVOLVES ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC INEQUALITY THAT HAS LED TO DISPROPORTIONATE LEVELS OF POVERTY INCARCERATION AND DIVESTMENT YOU MAYES OF COLOR. AND THE SECOND MORE CONCRETE GEN JUST AS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT VIOLENCE IS BOTH A SYMPTOM AND AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF MANY QUALITY WE HAVE TO INTENTIONALLY INVEST IN COMMUNITY LED AN EVIDENCE BASED PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES SO AS PART OF OUR. WORKING GET RUNS WITH HELP ORGANIZE A BROAD GOAL YOU KNOW THE LAST FEW YEARS COMMUNITY GROUPS ON THE GROUND. ACT I FROM ACROSS THE STATE ALL I. FOR TO MUCH. IN LOCAL. BASED THE PILOTS THAT ARE FORMED BY PUBLIC HEALTH PRINCIPLES AND WITH YOUR HELP FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY VERY GRATEFUL. I DO MENTION THIS YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S THE MINISTER WORK TO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR THREE YEAR INVESTMENTS. IN CALVET THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM. AND THIS IS A LOUD STRATEGIES LIKE ADVANCED PIECE WHICH IS AN INTENSIVE MENTORING PROGRAM FOR THOSE. WHO ARE VERY HIGH RISK OF BEING INVOLVED WITH SHOOTINGS- IT ORIGINATED IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA WHICH IS SEEING SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN HOMICIDES AND SHOOTINGS IN RECENT YEARS. AND WITH THE HELP OF CALVET FUNDING THAT STRATEGY. HAS BEEN SCALED. BACK YEAH AND FRIENDS. I'M NOT. EVERY STUDY FROM YOU BERKELEY HAS SHOWN THAT THIS. HAS REDUCED. CITIES AND PUBLICLY. SAVINGS FOR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF LIFESAVING WORK THEY COUNT THAT WAS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND. I'LL CLOSE OUT MY COMMENTS BY SAYING THAT THE INCREASED INVESTMENT ACCOUNT THAT COULD NOT COME AT A MORE CRITICAL TIME. ALTHOUGH HOMICIDE REACHED A SIX DECADE LOW HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH THE ONSET OF THE KOBE PANDEMIC WE'VE SEEN LARGE INCREASES IN COMMUNITY VIOLENCE IN MAY CALIFORNIA C. AS WE HAVEN'T CITIES ACROSS THE NATION REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICS. THIS BIG TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN CALVET OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS IS HISTORIC BUT THERE'S MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF SUSTAINING THE PROGRAM OVER THE LONG TERM. AND BUILDING A COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTER FOR ON THE GROUND VIOLENCE INTERVENTION WORKERS. WERE PUTTING THEMSELVES ON THE LINE TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITY SAFER SO WE ASK THAT YOU JOIN WITH US AS YOU HAVE IN THE PAST IN THE COMING YEAR. TO MAKE IT COUNT WHEN A NATIONAL LEADER ON THIS ISSUE. THE NEW TO SUPPORT BONTA PREVENTION PREVENTION WORK IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AND- IF YOU COULD STND THE LIGHT. AT ONE POINT I WANTED TO- TO MAYBE HOLD OFF QUITE TO THE BUT I JUST WANNA ASK. WE CAN YOU STAY ON THE LINE. AND IN. AT THE END WE CAN ASK QUESTIONS AND USE ABOUT A TEN FIFTEEN MINUTE SEGMENT. TASK ALL THE PANELISTS DIFFERENT QUESTIONS AND YOU MAY EVEN WANT TO. ADD TO THE FREE IF YOU COULD HANG AROUND. THAT WOULD BE GOOD THANK YOU. NEXT WILL HAVE A G. JULIUS THE VIDEO PROGRAM MANAGER ADVANCE PEACE. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE HELLO MY NAME IS JULIE IS TYPICAL ON STRATEGY PROGRAM MANAGER FOR ADVANCED YOU SACRAMENTO HERE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS. IS OF COURSE ISN'T SUSTAINABILITY IN THESE PROGRAMS. AND THE ABILITY TO BE ACTUALLY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FREEDOM TO RUN THESE PROGRAMS WHERE WE'RE NOT BEING TOLD BY THOSE WHO ARE FUNDING THE PROGRAMS HOW THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE CULTURAL AWARENESS THOSE WHO AREN'T. ALL MOVES ON THE GROUND AND DON'T HAVE THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE WHO ARE AT THE CENTER OF GUN VIOLENCE IN WHO ARE AT HIGHEST RISK TO EITHER BE PERPETRATORS OR VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE- ADVANCE PEACE IS A PROVEN STRATEGY THE PEACEMAKER FELLOWSHIP. IS A PROVEN STRATEGY THAT'S NOW BEING USED AS MIKE STATED IN RICHMOND SACRAMENTO. FRESNO AND STOCKING. AND- COMING SOON TO VALLEJO. AND OF COURSE IS THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION BUT OF COURSE WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA- THE INCREASE IN THE FUNDING ALLOWS US ROOT FOR IT FOR INSTANCE A SITUATION LIKE WE'RE FACING HEARING IN SACRAMENTO- CAL PEOPLE ALLOWED US TO HAVE A JUNIOR COLLEGE YEAR- WHICH TARGETS INDIVIDUALS AGES TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN NEVER IN THE HISTORY OF US THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO PRIOR TO THAT DID THEY EVER HAVE ONE YEAR. WITH NO JOB AND NOW I'M- THIS FUNDING ALLOWED US TO ACTUALLY WEIGH IN FOCUS AND BUILD RELATIONSHIPS AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO IT BASICALLY ALLOWED US TO GO ON A TWENTY EIGHT MONTH RUN. OF NO JUVENILE HOMICIDES HISTORICAL RUN. AND OF COURSE THAT WAS ENDED BY THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS. A DEEP THE DIET TO. THE DISINVESTMENT BUT THEY'RE WHERE WE'D NO LONGER WE NO LONGER- FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FAR A WELL THE OLDER GENERATION I THINK WHAT ALLOW THIS. WOULD ALLOW US TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS AREA IS THAT WE ALSO HAVE A SENIOR FELLOWSHIP THAT ADDRESSES AND FOCUSES ON INDIVIDUALS AGES EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY NINE AND THESE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS THAT PAGES. THAT THE AGES TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN LOOK UP TO THE MALLS. SO WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE BASICALLY HIT ME FROM ALL AREAS AND YOUR PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES RESOURCES AND BUILDING THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE WHAT YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE CEO OF A BASKETBALL BOGEY. IS THAT OCE YOU BUILD A RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THE SKY'S THE LIMIT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A HEALING APPROACH WHERE WE ARE. HIDING IN THE CAR. BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND PRETTY MUCH GIVE THEM ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE- ALTERNATIVE THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN EXPOSED TO- AT AT A YOUNG AGE WHERE NOW WHEN THEY AREN'T WITH THEIR CREDIBLE MENTORS WHEN WE CALL NEIGHBORHOOD CHANGE AGENTS THEY'RE MAKING BETTER DECISIONS- ULTIMATELY WE BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THEDAY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. THAT THIS IS THIS IS ULTIMATELY WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN WE INVEST AND WE SHOW THEM THAT SOMEONE ACTUALLY CARES AND I KNOW I CAN SPEAK AT LIVE ABOUT THE WALLS IN THE DISTRUST AND THE INABILITY TO POLICE OUR WAY OUT OF THE SITUATION- IT'S REALLY IT'S REALLY A HOLISTIC HEALING PROCESS AND ANY SCRIPT- PROVEN TO WORK. BUT WE HAVE TO LET THE EXPERTS ON THE GROUND DO THEIR JOB AND WE HAVE TO STEP BACK AND ALLOW THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AREAS WERE AGAIN OR I'VE ALREADY STATED THAT RECRUITMENT TO BE SUCCESSFUL SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT- ALSO WANT TO END ON THIS NOTE THAT I BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD DO A DO CALIFORNIA GREAT SERVICE I KNOW HERE SACRAMENTO WE HAVE THE HIGHEST SUSPENSION RATE. AND ME MYSELF COMING OUT THE YOUNG PERSON WHENEVER I'M SUSPENDED SIR I KNOW WHEN EVER ACTUALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS JUST PUNCHED AND THREATENED WITH MORE PUNISHMENT IF I CONTINUED ON DOWN THIS PATH EVENTUALLY EXPEL AND NOW WE HAVE THE SCOOP PRISON PIPELINE BUT IF WE CAN GET ANSWER OUR SALES IN THEIR LIVES THAT THESE EIGHT AND ACTUALLY MADE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AVAILABLE THINGS LIKE ANGER MANAGEMENT- L. E. MOTIONAL CHALLENGED AVAILABLE WEAPONS AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL EVEN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL. I THINK WE CAN ALSO PUT A DENT IN GUN VIOLENCE IN EVEN THE EVEN THE DESIRE TO WANT TO HAVE WITH YOUR WHICH WE KNOW WAS BASED ON ACES AND TRIBE SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I KNOW WILL PROBABLY. CIRCLE BACK WITH QUESTIONS LATER ON. THANK YOU MISTER DAVIDO- I'M MORE NO MR CAL IS ONLINE YEAH. MAY SO LET'S GO TO PASTOR MICHAEL MCBRIDE DIRECTOR OF URBAN STRATEGIES FAITH IN ACTION. INDIA WILL HAVE QUITE. GOOD AFTERNOON AND GOOD AFTERNOON IT'S GREAT TO BE WITH YOU WALL AND- SO MUCH APPRECIATION. OUR TO THE STATUS OF THE BOYS THE MEN OF COLOR SELECT COMMITTEE- WE I HAVE BEEN A PART OF. THOSE COMMUNITIES- A SUPPORT SYSTEM MEAN AND CHAMPION IS EFFORT SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF- ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANDRA SWANSON STAY CENTER SO THEY THIS IS BRAND I EXECUTED AN IMPORTANT PART. OF HOW WE HAVE LITERALLY TURNED THE TIDE NOT JUST AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT NATIONALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT CAN WE DO STRATEGICALLY PRO DRESS- THE LIVE CONDITIONS OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. IN OUR STATE I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE NOW AT ANOTHER CROSSROADS MOMENT. WE HAVE SEEN- ONE OF THE LARGEST SPIKES AND INCREASES OF GUN VIOLENCE- IN ALMOST A COUPLE DECADES AND WE HAVE I BELIEVE ONE OF THE POLITICAL ARGUMENT AT LEAST NATIONALLY AND HOPEFULLY LOCALLY. THAT GUN VIOLENCE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE MEANING- WE DO NOT HAVE TO RELY ON FAILED STRATEGIES FROM THE NINETIES ARE TOUGH ON CRIME APPROACH IS. TO GET A HANDLE ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS GUN VIOLENCE INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE A RESULT. OF COLD IT NINETEEN- IMPACTS THAT HAVE EXACERBATED THE ALREADY PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS OF TRAUMA. OF FEAR ANGER AND OF LOS IN OF GRIEF WE KNOW. THAT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME OF THE STEEPEST LOSSES RELATED TO COVE IN NINETEEN. WE ALSO KNOW THAT- THE MATRIARCHS AND PATRIARCHS THE BIG MAMA'S THE IRAQIS. CARE TAKERS THAT HAVE LITERALLY KILLED SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS- HAVE TRANSITION OR GOTTEN SICK TO THE POINT DURING THIS CALL THE NINETEEN THAT MANY OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND BOYS ARE NOW LEFT WITHOUT. A DEEP SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND NET TO NURTURE THEM TO PROTECT THEM AND TO KEEP THEM SAFE. WHAT THIS AFFORDS US IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOW BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE USING OUR TAX DOLLARS TO INSURE THAT WE CAN SECURE SAFETY HEALING. AND PEACE MAKING AT THIS SCALE COMMENSURATE TO THE CRISIS WE ARE FACING FACING. WE DO HAVE A CONUNDRUM BEFORE US THOUGH BECAUSE THERE IS A TENDENCY IN THESE MOMENTS OF VULNERABILITY PARTAKE WITH BLACK AND BROWN YOUNG MEN THAT WE REACH FOR A PUNITIVE RESPONSE. RATHER THAN A HUMAN RESPONSE. THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE HEARD. BY OUR. PARTNERS ON THIS I'LL CALL IN A AREN'T TESTIFY. GIVES US A REAL. AND SH. AFTER WE'RE CAN LATER CAPTURE THE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS- WHO ARE CLAD IN VIOLENT CYCLES OVER TIME AND ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT LOSE THEIR LIVES OR THEIR FREEDOM. AS WE ATTEMPT TO SECURE PEACE AND SECURITY IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO THE IDEA THAT WE NOW HAVE. BECAUSE OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SET ASIDE BY THE GOVERNOR TO OUR COLLECTIVE ADVOCACY AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ARE ANTICIPATING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BEING PUT INTO PLACE. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF SHOOTING. FOR BEING SHOT WE NOW HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AT THIS LEVEL IN THE SELECT COMMITTEES NOT ONLY AFFIRMED THIS WORK BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS A PLACEHOLDER FOR BUILDING AN INFRASTRUCTURE OF PEACEMAKING AND HEALING IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. I WANT TO SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WE HAVE EXPERTS WHO COME FROM THESE COMMUNITIES BROTHER JUSTIN IS ONE HE'S ALREADY NAME DROPPED HIS BOSS WHO MANY OF YOU ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PHONE BOCANEGRA MUHAMMAD. REAGAN CUNNINGHAM SO MANY OTHERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE'S GIVE TOWNSEND ETCETERA ETCETERA WHO CAN HELP US BE ABLE TO ANCHOR THE STRATEGIES. IN THE CITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED I WILL SAY TO YOU AS A FAITH LEADER IS SOMEONE WHO IS- BEEN. REALLY TRYING TO CHAMPION AT CERTAINLY ACROSS THE STATE BUT ALSO ACROSS THE COUNTRY A WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LITERALLY REIMAGINE PUBLIC SAFETY USING THESE STRATEGIES AS THE TIP OF THE SPEAR. MY HOPE IS THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO CONVINCE ARE LIFTED OFFICIALS IN THE MOST PROGRESSIVE STATE TO REALLY GO ALL IN ON THIS EFFORT. BUT THAT WE CAN'T JUST LIKE WE WERE ABLE TO SHIFT THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ON BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE WE CAN NOW HELP SHIFT THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION TO IMPLEMENTATION AND HOPEFULLY FINDING AND SCALING IT INFRASTRUCTURE. AROUND HOW WE REIMAGINE PUBLIC SAFETY PARTICULARLY AROUND GUN RELATED SHOOTINGS AND HOMICIDES THAT IMPACT BLACK AND BROWN MEAT IN THEIR FAMILIES HOW CAN WE DO THIS WITHOUT RETURNING TO IMPUNITY OF APPROACH THAT GROWS THE PRISON. THE JAILS AND THE CRIMINALIZATION OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE HAVE OUT ACHIEVING THE PUBLIC SAFETY WE SO DESIRE- WE HAVE A SIX IN OUR AND- BUT WE ARE NOW EXT. A VERY CHALLENGING EIGHTEEN MONTHS SIMILAR PLACES LIKE FRESNO SIMILAR PLACES LIVESTOCK IN SIMILAR PLACES LIKE RICHMOND. SIMILAR PLACES IN LOS ANGELES AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WELL WE CERTAINLY NEED TO SELECT COMMITTEE TO HELP US MAINSTREAM THIS WORK IN MANY OF US- OUR ONLINE- WILL NOT JUST THE BATTLEFIELD WERE ALSO STANDING IN SOLIDARITY WITH YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. ALSO AGAIN DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE GLAD TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I DO BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD A NEW POLITICAL COALITION ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT DOES NOT OVER DETERMINAR COMMUNITIES. AYE ACOSTA POLICING OR PUNITIVE MISS- THERE IS A WAY TO LITERALLY FIND KEYS AND IT VANCE PLEASE AND- CENTER HEALING AND MAY WE MAKE IT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TOWNS ON YET OKAY SO WE'LL GO TO QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AND I'LL- AND I'LL ALL STARTED BECAUSE YOU IT EACH OF THE PANELISTS GAVE SOME IMPRESSIVE. I'M DATA AND NUMBERS ARE YOUR SUCCESS RATE USING- YOUR REHABILITATION STRATEGIES- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NOW IN A PROGRESSIVE SIDE BUT ALSO MY COLLEAGUES- FOR EXAMPLE MR LACKEY NICER FROM PUBLIC SAFETY. IS MY VICE CHAIR AND ON. ON THAT COMMITTEE AND WE ALSO SERVE. BONDI SUB FIVE WHICH BY FUNDS ALL OF THE PROGRAMS IN PUBLIC SAFETY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT KIND OF BRINGS BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TOGETHER. IS DATA. AND THEN WHAT WE WHAT LIKE TO SEE IS EITHER INTERNAL AUDITS. OR ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO SHOW THAT YOUR NUMBERS ARE NOT ONLY SUCCESSFUL BUT YOU'RE KEEPING DATA OVER A PERIOD OF TIME SHOWING YOUR SUCCESS RATE. AND I AND I I'VE SEEN IT PERSONALLY WERE EVEN INDIVIDUALS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WHEN THEY SEE THE NUMBERS AND THEY SEE HOW. IT IS A PROVEN ENTITY THAT IT IT CAN WORK AND YOU CAN SHOW THAT DATA. OF WE HAVE A BETTER. SUCCESS RATE IN GETTING FUNDING FOR ANY AND ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND SO I KNOW EACH OF YOU HAVE GIVEN SOME SOME SOME SOME DATA. BUT I WANNA KNOW INTERNALLY DO YOU DO INTERNAL AUDITS DO YOU KEEP RECORDS TO KEEP IT FOR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS. HOW DO YOU MEASURE YOUR SUCCESS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY FOR ALL OF US ESPECIALLY POLICY MAKERS AND PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS ON BUDGETS- WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO GIVE MONEY TO THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS. AND I AND I SEE MR LEKAN SHAKING HIS HEAD HE HE TO WANT TO FUND- PROGRAMS I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES. HERE MR ASK CARO WHO'S JUST TRYING TO SEE WHO'S CHAIRED PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS ABU WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO SELL THAT TO EVERYONE TO ALL EIGHTY MEMBERS AND THEN TO THE SENATE AND INTO THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR. AND SO I KNOW IT'S A LONG WINDED WAY BUT IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME EXAMPLES ON ON HOW YOU CONSISTENTLY MEASURE YOUR SUCCESS TO VALIDATE- WHY YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL- IT WILL BE GREAT FOR US AND WE CAN INCORPORATE. SOME OF WHAT YOU DO TO IT IN OUR AND OUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS WE COULD INCORPORATE THAT AS A WAY TO VALIDATE BECAUSE OF THE MORE MORE WE CAN VALIDATE. THE MORE MONEY I CAN GET YOU AND AS WE ALL KNOW THE BEST WAY. TO STOP A BULLET IS A JOB. IN THE BEST WAY TO GET A JOB IS EDUCATION AND THE BEST WAY TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION TO CREATE ENVIRONMENT SO YOU CAN GET BETTER EDUCATED SO- I WILL. LEAVE YOU WITH THAT IF THE ANY ANY ONE OF YOU- HAVE ANY. SUGGESTIONS. OR IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN DO THAT. YEAH I'M GRANTED AT LEAST OFFER A COUPLE OF REFERENCE POINTS FOR YOU THAT CAN HELP QUANTIFY. THE FISCAL IMPACT AND SAVINGS OF THE SAID STRATEGIES. FOR THE DATA MUHAMMAD WHO HAS BEEN A KEY ARCHITECT OF THIS WORK FOR MANY YEARS- HE'S BEEN HELPING LITERALLY TO BE ONE OF OUR A BILL STATE AND NATIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPERTS TO THE- NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. A GROUP THAT PRESIDENT MUHAMMAD BOTH MYSELF AND OTHERS I HELPED A LOT SEVERAL YEARS AGO HAS A WHOLE WEBSITE OF REPORTS. THAT CAN HELP QUANTIFY WHAT WE CALL THE COST OF VIOLENCE- THE KIND OF COSTS THAT ARE. LITERACY ACCUMULATED BY EVERY SHOOTING THAT HAPPENS IN OUR COMMUNITIES- THE COST OF AMBULANCE TO COST OF- HELD SERVICES CRIMINAL JUSTICE. SYSTEMS THE CITY COUNTY AND STATE COSTS FOR GUN VIOLENCE PER SHOOTING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- COST THE STATE ONE POINT SEVEN NINE MILLION DOLLARS PER SHOOTING. ACCORDING THESE CALCULATIONS AND AGAIN YOU CAN GO TO ACOSTA VIOLENCE DOT ORG AND JUST SEE- THESE VERY IMPRESSIVE- WELL- PRODUCED AND EVALUATED- KIND OF NUMBERS. ONE OF THE MOST. POWERFUL COMPONENTS SO HOW WE HAVE DONE OUR WORK IS TO ARTICULATE OR DEFINE THE COST FOR PEACE. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE FOUND. IS THAT IT LITERALLY. ALL ABOUT FOR TO DOLLARS. PER PERSON- THAT IS. YOU KNOW RESOURCES DEDICATED TO SOME KIND OF LIVABLE WAGE FOR A JOB- FULL TIME CASE MANAGER- AND SOME OTHER SELECTED SERVICES- IF YOU TAKE THE- THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF. THAT INVESTMENT IN ONE PERSON- THAT LITERALLY WILL SAVE YOU MILLIONS OF DOCTORS OVER TIME- IN THE FIRST YEAR IN THE CITY OF LOCAL WE HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WHO WE IDENTIFIED WERE AT THE HIGH SCHOOL SCHOOL SHOOTING OR BEING SHOT. AND WE ESTIMATED THAT THAT- EXPENSE TO THE TAXPAYERS IT OPEN WAS ABOUT THIRTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS. OVER SEVERAL YEARS OUR INVESTMENT USING THESE KINDS OF NUMBERS AND METRICS LITERALLY- YOU KNOW REQUIRED AN INVESTMENT OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. OVER THOSE FOR FIVE YEARS WE WERE ABLE TO SEE A REDUCTION BY 50% IN THE GUN RELATED SHOOTINGS OR HOMICIDES IN THE CITY OF OAK. A CITY THAT WAS LITERALLY SPENDING OVER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- JUST IN COLLATERAL COSTS WITH OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OF ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS PRODUCED A 50% REDUCTION. THESE ARE NOT ANECDOTAL NUMBERS BUT THESE ARE NUMBERS THAT CAN BE PROVEN. WITH- EVALUATIONS. WITH RESEARCH AND CERTAINLY WITH- OUR I THINK THE BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS THAT YOU ARE RIGHT MEET- LIFTING UP FOR BOTH ARE A DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT LAWMAKERS AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE SO WE ARE VERY EXCITED. AND WILLING TO OFFER- THESE KIND OF THE- TALKING POINTS ARGUMENTS AND STUDY SO YOU WALKING NUMBER QUESTION YOURSELVES- NOW OF COURSE I WOULD JUST SAY AS A PASTOR TO FAITH LEADER- HOW MUCH. IS A LIFE WORDS AND I WOULD SAY TO YOU- THESE NUMBERS PALE IN COMPARISON TO THE KIND OF LIVES THAT WE ARE LITERALLY KEEPING ALIVE AND FREE TO STABILIZE NEIGHBORHOODS COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. AND SO THE PRICELESS NATURE OF A LIFE- CERTAINLY IS OUR VALUES THAT DRIVES. TO WORK THE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BEING ASKED OF US WE WERE. TALKING ABOUT THE USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THANK YOU TO READING COMES FOR IN A OTHER. I WOULD JUST BRIEFLY ADD ON IN THAT THAT THEY COUNTED COALITION HAS BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON THIS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND I'M EXCITED TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO COME FROM ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BEING ALLOCATED TO COMBAT PART OF THE. SB SEC WHICH ADMINISTERS COMMENT THE ABILITY NOW TO CONTRACT WITH A THIRD PARTY RESEARCHERS ARE GETTING DATA COLLECTION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EVALUATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE NOT HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT BEFORE BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESOURCES SO. THAT'S GONNA LET US SEE MORE DATA THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE HOW ABOUT GROUPS THAT ARE DOING THE WORK TO COLLECT DATA AND MORE EFFICIENT WAY AND I WOULD OUR WEEK I MEAN WE ALREADY HAVE VERY IMPRESSIVE RESULTS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT THIS IS GOING TO FURTHER CEMENT THAT- JUST AS AN EXAMPLE THE UC BERKELEY STUDY I MENTIONED LOOKING AT ADVANCE PEACE IN SACRAMENTO. SITE TWENTY TWO AND THE PRIOR ONE OR TWO YEAR PERIOD IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE ADVANCED PIECES BEEN ACTIVE NINE DOUBLE DIGIT REDUCTIONS IN MANY DIFFERENT CITIES WE LOOK AT A DIFFERENT- AND THE WHOLE STATE AND SONIC CALVET FUNDED CITIES SOME REDUCTIONS IN OVERALL HOMICIDES THREE TIMES FASTER OR THREE TIMES GREATER I SHOULD SAY THAN NON CALVET FUNDED CITIES SO. WE CAN SEE THAT THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE IT MAKE AN IMPACT AND I THINK WITH THE NEW- THIRD PARTY RESEARCH CONTRACT AND DEEPER ABILITY TO DO EVALUATIONS WILL HAVE EVEN MORE- VERY GRANULAR IMPACT INFORMATION AVAILABLE SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THAT WELL I PASTOR MIGHT BE PASSED REGARD WITH THING- THERE'S ALREADY A VERY COMPELLING CASE TO BE MADE POSSIBLE ANNOUNCES EXTREME. AND THERE'S VERY SPECIFIC STUDIES ON THE COST SAVINGS- AND THE LIVES THAT ARE BEING STATE I'M IN CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THAT ARE BEING SUPPORTED BY. THANK YOU. MISTER CAR HAS A QUESTION. THANK THANK YOU- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE PEOPLE TO THE TIME OF AND CREDIBLE THE SPEAKER AND ALL THREE PANELS SO HAPPY TO BE HERE AND TO LEARN AND TO LISTEN AS WELL AS OFFER SOME THOUGHTS. AND WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS I CAME UP WITH ALL THE FOLKS IS SPOKEN AND I THINK THAT WE KNOW THAT HAVE SEEN SUCCESS IN SOME OF THESE PROGRAM APPROVAL CONCEPT IS THERE BUT OF COURSE THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW MUCH THE COST WAS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. AND SO IT IN IN MY HOME TOWN IN SAN JOSE- WE'VE BEEN TAKING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE ON THAT AS OF LATE. ON A COUPLE FRONTS BECAUSE IN THE CITY IS SOUNDS A ALONE. IT'S ESTIMATED THE COST OF. GUN VIOLENCE APPROXIMATELY AS A PROXY FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. A THIRTY FIVE MILLION OF WHICH IS DIRECT. OUT OF POCKET COST. SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION OR SO. LOST WORK. AND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT MILLION IN QUALITY OF LIFE. SO ULTIMATELY WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THAT NOW WHO WILL WHO WERE SHOULD NOT BURDEN WHY. HE SHOULD BE ON EVERY WONDERFUL TO BE SOME SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. ON THOSE THAT- HAVE GUNS AND EVEN IF THE RESPONSE OWNERS I. HAVE AUTO INSURANCE. AND MANY RESPONSIBLE DRIVER THEY DON'T GET A TICKET FIFTY YEARS. THEY PAY INTO THE INSURANCE SYSTEM RIGHT. BECAUSE AN ACCIDENT CAN HAPPEN EVEN IF YOU'RE A GOOD DRIVER- AND SO. ONE OF THE CONCEPTS BROUGHT BOARD OVER THERE WAS ACTUALLY APPROVED BY OUR CITY COUNCIL WAS. OF IT IN TERMS OF REDUCING GUN HARM THROUGH AN INSURANCE MANDATE IS REQUIRING. OWNERS TO CARRY LIABILITY INSURANCE. ON THE OTHER- REGARDING REDUCING THE PUBLIC COSTA GUN VIOLENCE. IS HAVING A FIFTY- TO COVER TAX PER COSTS FOR EVERYONE THAT POSSESSES OR OWNS A GUN- IN OUR CITY. AND SO THAT'S OF THOSE ARE A COUPLE BEHIND AND THOUSANDS MORE THAN I WAS THE FIRST CITY TO DO THAT- TO IS TO HAVE BOTH THE INSURANCE MANDATE AND THAT IS IN ADDITION. HAVE A FEE. FOR OPEN GUN OWNERS AS ARE ANY OF THE PANELISTS OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT BECAUSE AGAIN I WANT THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE RUNNING NEED TO BE FUNDED BY SOMEONE AND SOMEHOW. AND I THINK THAT THERE IS. WE'VE SHOWN WITH AUTO INSURANCE THAT THE ABILITY TO USE RISK ADJUSTED PREMIUMS TO REWARD GOOD DRIVING. AND INCENTIVIZE USE OF SAFETY FEATURES AIRBAGS WHAT HAVE YOU SOME ONLY YOU CAN REWARD TAKING SAFETY CLASSES USING GUNS SAVES A STALLING TRIPPING ON AND ON AND ON COULD BE REWARDED. BY AN INSURANCE CARRIER SOMEONE OPTS NOT TO DO IT MAYBE THE PRIOR INSURANCE BUT JUST THROWING THAT CONCEPT OUT THERE TO SEE TO HELP FUND SOME OF THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING AND OTHER. TYPES OF PROGRAMS AND NEEDS. AS WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING THE REST THIS AFTERNOON. GRADUATES NO I JUST I JUST WAS GOING TO SAY BEFORE YOU SPEAK MY- THAT WE HAD WE HAD SUGGESTED THAT A GUN TAX. BE PLACED ON ON GUN SALES AND THAT THAT MONEY WOULD BE GO THAT MONEY WOULD BE A- GOOD FOR CHECKOUT. SO I KNOW MY CAN. EDUCATE YOU MORE SO ON THAT BECAUSE IT RAN INTO SOME HURDLES. SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE AND LEGISLATION. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO ADD REAL QUICKLY THAT- ALSO WITH THE WITH THE WITH THE ABILITY TO TRACK. COST SAVING. WE ALSO CONTRACT. CONTRACT HOW WILL INDIVIDUALS PERFORM- YOU CAN LOOK AT YOU CAN ALSO GO TO THE ADVANCED THESE WEBSITES IN ALL THE ADVANCED HE CITIES NEAR IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE UC BERKELEY PROVIDES- AN ASSESSMENT A ONE YEAR ASSESSMENT IN A TWO YEAR ASSESSMENT OF EACH PROGRAM. AND IT'LL IT'LL GIVE YOU DETAILS ON HOW YOUNG PERSONS DOING WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE A LIFE MAP WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE PLEASE CONTACT WHETHER OR NOT THEY GET INVOLVED. WITH FIREARMS WHETHER BEING ARRESTED OR BEING A VICTIM OF FIREARM ASSAULT DURING THE TIME THAT THERE IN EIGHTEEN MONTH COHORT SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT IS REALLY EXTENSIVE- REAL PROFESSIONAL AND REAL INFORMATIVE. WELL MY CAMERA CAN BETTER ANSWER THAT QUESTION IN REGARDS TO HOW WE GET BETTER FUNDING. THANK YOU. THANKS TO IT I WOULD JUST QUICKLY YOU KNOW ARE THE CAP THE COALITION I MENTIONED CAL THE COALITION IT REALLY CAREFULLY LOOKING AT THIS FOR NEXT YEAR NOW AS THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW. WE'RE DEPENDENT ON YOU KNOW FUNDING HELP OF THE GENERAL FUND WHICH MEANS WE'RE COMING BACK AND FIGHTING FOR FUNDING EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND IT'S GONNA BE VERY IMPORTANT TO JUST IN BAD THIS SYSTEM INTO CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT CREATIVE WAYS TO DO THAT I THINK RIGHT NOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF OPPORTUNITY- FROM. WHETHER IT'S BREEDING AND FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE AMERICAN RELIEF PLAN OVERSEEING STATES DOING CROSS THE COUNTRY I WE'RE SEEING JUST THIS YEAR CONNECTICUT AND ILLINOIS FOR THE FIRST TIME. ARE HARNESSING MEDICAID TO USE A 50% FEDERAL MATCH TO REIMBURSE VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROFESSIONALS ARE DOING THE WORK- AND THEN I WOULD SAY WE'RE LOOKING VERY CLOSELY. AT THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SORT OF EXCITED SPEED OR TAX- RELATED KIT TO AMMUNITION AND FIREARMS SALES WHICH ARE I SHOULD MENTION I HAVE RECORD LEVELS IN TWENTY TWENTY LAST YEAR AND IN IN CONJUNCTION COULD RECITE HUGE SPIKE. NOT JUST IN VIOLENCE BUT IN GUN. SALES AS WELL WHICH I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUEEN EVENTS. AND IT'S TIME WHEN THERE ARE. NO RECORDS. FOR THE GUN INDUSTRY AT THE TIME WE BE CAP. SOME THAT AND- AFTER THE NAKED NEXT. OF FIRE AND EVEN ARE CAN. AND AN USING TO AND BACK INTO THE- ARE BEING MOST THIS. IMPACTED BY THOSE LEFT IN. AND LASTING AFFAIRS ROUGH LOOKING AT THE CURSOR. BILLS TO CREATE COST SAVINGS- SIMILAR PROP FORTY SEVEN AND OTHER GOING ON JUSTICE REFORMS- AND THESE ARE. I'M DOUBLE BENEFIT AND THAT THE ADDRESS THAT MAJOR INCARCERATION PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE UNITED STATES IN GENERAL AND THEN TAKE THOSE SAVINGS AND REINVEST THEM BACK INTO COMMUNITIES AND ALL STATE. BEING FROM A GROUP THAT DOES WORK ON FIREARM POLICY GUNS AND FIREARM LAWS ARE ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE. UNITED THAT HAVE MAJOR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND AS A STATE WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND CAREFUL WAY. AND SCALE BACK ON EXPENSE WHERE IT'S APPROPRIATE AND USE THOSE COST SAVINGS TO BUILD COMMUNITIES BACK UP RATHER THAN. TEARING THEM DOWN WITH UNITIVE APPROACHES SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OPTIONS AND REALLY. WANT TO ESTABLISH SUSTAINABILITY- IN THE IN THE COMING LEGISLATIVE SESSION I LOVE THE COKE OF THE- THE NEED TO QUANTIFY IS ABSOLUTELY THERE TO BE ABLE TO SHOWCASE. THAT CONNECTING THE DOTS BETWEEN THE COST SAVINGS OF THE OF THE CARCERAL SYSTEM. AND GOING INTO PROGRAMS THAT DO WORK AND TOO MUCH OF THE BILL'S POINT. OF WE HAVE THE DATA WE CAN SHOW WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE MONEY ITS ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S WORKING. AND I THINK ULTIMATELY- IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONGOING FUNDING YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDING. AND SO FINDING WAYS TO GET ONGOING FUNDING BECAUSE YES WE MIGHT BE IN A GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES TODAY. WE GO INTO RECESSION NEXT YOU KNOW THOSE PROGRAMS ARE GONE YOU HAVE TO JUST NOT SUSTAINED OVER MANY YEARS. THEN YOU HAVE TO REBUILD IT EVERYFEW YEARS AND THAT DOESN'T WORK ESPECIALLY WITH OUR YOUTH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MAJORITY BY MISS CAREER DID YOU. HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU ON THIS PANEL. OKAY SO I WANT TO THANK EACH OUR PANEL. THIS DISS VERY VERY GOOD IN A LIGHT. AND WE GOING TO TAKE TO DATA. AND MOVE FORWARD WITH IT AD- DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU SEE THAT WE CAN. FOR NOW YEAR. TO GIVE THANK YOU PANEL NUMBER ONE. THE NOW WILL BRING ON. CHANNEL TWO- MITIGATING DEPEND DEMOCRATS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AMONG COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- I HAVE SEVERAL PEOPLE LEANDER CLARK HARVEY PHD CHIEF EXECUTIVE. CALIFORNIA COUNCIL COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES. SHE'S HERE. ANDREA CHAPMAN. MA FOUNDER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OFFICER UNITY CARE. HE I BELIEVE HE'S HERE JOSEPHINA ARADO MADE MAYNA- CHIEF EXEC ROCKER SAFE PASSAGES- JACK BARBER MD PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND REHABILITATION PROGRAM. AND YOU TACOS BRINGER PHD DIRECTOR OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER GATHERING OF NATIVE AMERICANS GONNA- EGYPT FIVE MINUTES APIECE AND YOU WANT TO START WITH DOCTOR HARVEY. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WTH YOU ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR DURING BOTH THE HEALTH AND THE RACIAL PANDEMIC THAT WERE ALSO COPING WITH I WANT ESPECIALLY CHECK THINK THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR HIS COMPREHENSIVE AND THOUGHTFUL AGENDA INCLUDING A PANEL ABOUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. AND THANK YOU TO HIS STAFF FOR FACILITATING OUR PARTICIPATION TODAY SO I'M JUST GONNA TO SPEAK BRIEFLY BECAUSE THE STARS ARE REALLY NEXT TO ME BUT I WANT TO GROUND THE DISCUSSION TODAY HISTORICALLY BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR BY POP COMMUNITIES. THEIR USE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICE HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING ACCESS TO TREATMENT. CULTURAL BELIEFS AND STIGMA. AND BECAUSE OF THIS ONE BY PARK INDIVIDUALS DO SEEK HELP IT TENDS TO BE AT A TIME OF CRISIS. AT AN EMERGENCY ROOM A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL OR DUE TO SOME TYPE OF- INTERACTION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT SINCE THE START OF THIS PANDEMIC. YOUTH AND IN PARTICULAR BY PARK YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED A 10% INCREASE IN OPIOID USE WE'VE SEEN INCREASES IN YOUTH DEATH BY SUICIDE. CALLS TO CRISIS HOTLINE HAVE INCREASED FOR EXAMPLE THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE THAT SEVERAL OF OUR MEMBERS RUN HAVE SEEN THIS INFLUX AS WELL. AND IN A NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR MENTAL WELLBEING STUDY OF FOUR THOUSAND BIPAP ADULTS DURING THE KOPET NINETEEN PANDEMIC THEY FOUND THAT 11% OF BLACK ADULTS THEY QUOTE FINDING AN ORGANIZATION THAT LOOKS LIKE ME. OR SHARES MY CULTURE AND IDENTITY HAS BEEN THE LARGEST OBSTACLE TO SEEKING TREATMENT FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. NOW WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY THAT HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY LINKED TO HOW THIS RACIAL PANDEMIC HAS REALLY REARED ITS UGLY HEAD AND IMPACTED MANY COMMUNITIES. SO ALL OF THIS IS PROBLEMATIC AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR STATE WILL SEE AN INFLUX OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES AS CHILDREN GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND PARENTS GO BACK TO IN PERSON WORK. SO THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE PROCESSED AND THERE NEED TO BE SUPPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY AND PLACE TO HELP BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AND THEIR COMMUNITIES COPE IN THE AFTERMATH OF THESE PANDEMICS. SO DESPITE THAT VERY BLEAK PICTURE THAT I PAINTED I THINK THE MOST IMPACTFUL PART OF THIS PANEL IS THE MEMBER AGENCIES THAT C. B. H. A. RPRESENTS THAT PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ANNUALLY. SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER AGENCIES AND OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER HAVE ALSO JOINED US HERE TODAY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE POSITIVE PROGRAMS AND THE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE BEING FACILITATED ACROSS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. OUR GOAL IS SIMPLE TODAY IT'S REALLY TO PROMOTE AN UP LEFT CULTURALLY SPECIFIC MODELS THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE UNIQUE HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE RESILIENCE OF BOYS MEN OF COLOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I WILL SEE MY TIME TO OUR FIRST WITNESS UNDER CHAPMAN BEFORE YOU BEGIN MISTER. SUTTON DR HARVEY COULD YOU GET A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE LISTENING NO WOULD BY TALK MEANS SO COULD YOU BREAK THOSE LETTERS OUT FOR. SURE AGAIN BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR BYE. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON SPEAKER- THANK YOU FOR UP TO YOUR SPEAKING AND OBVIOUSLY I SEE MY GOOD FRIEND- SO MEMBER CARLA- FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU NEED TO CARE IS PROVIDED HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH IN SUPPORT OF SERVICE TO THOUSANDS OF FOSTER YOUTH AND EMERGING ADULTS. THROUGHOUT NINE COUNTIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF FIGHTING FOR. SYSTEMIC RACISM FIGHT AGAINST IMMIGRATION WITHIN THE FOSTER CARE JUVENILE JUSTICE MENTAL SYSTEMS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT BLACK AND BROWN. YOUNG MEN THAT PUT THEM ON A PATHWAY TO PRISON FROM FOSTER CARE TO PRISON WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. THE PIPELINE BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT FOSTER PRISON. I WILL GIVE YOU A QUICK STORY A YOUNG MAN- NAME DANTE TURNED TWENTY ONE. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY. HE MOVED INTO HIS OWN APARTMENT AFTER LEAVING FOSTER CARE. HE HAD A JOB- A MONTH LATER HIS GRANDMOTHER CAME DOWN OF COVERT. A MONTH AFTER THAT HE LOST HIS JOB TWO MONTHS AFTER THAT HE RECEIVED A THIRTY DAY NOTICE TO VACATE HIS APARTMENT BECAUSE HE NO LONGER HAD INCOME. DANTE IN UP IN THE HOSPITAL HE HAD HIS FIRST BREAK OF PSYCHIATRIC PSYCHIATRIC BRINK. DANTE IS AN EXAMPLE. OF MANY OF OUR YOUNG FOLKS IN THE FOSTER SYSTEM THAT LEAVE THE SYSTEM WITHOUT THE PROPER LEVELS OF SUPPORT. THINK ABOUT THE DATA 4250% OF OUR KIDS LEAVE FOSTER CARE ABOUT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. WITHIN FOUR YEARS OF NO EARNINGS. AND WE THINK ABOUT OUR PRISON POPULATION JUST AS WE JUST HEARD FROM PRIOR PANEL THE PRISONERS HAVE NO HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA SO WE THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WHO THOSE SHOOTERS ARE AND WHO'S WHO IS THAT COMMUNITIES CAN BE IMPACTED OUR PRISON SYSTEMS IT'S OUR YOUNG FOLKS AT LEAVE THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM- WITHOUT HOPE. A CHILD GROWING UP WITHOUT HOPE BECAUSE THE CHILD HAS TO SURVIVE WHEN THEY GET OUT THERE ON THE STREETS BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER OPTIONS. WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT IT WAS YET ANOTHER BLOW. TO A TRAUMATIZED POPULATION. IN FOSTER CARE THE GEORGIA FLORIDA THE SOCIAL UNREST. THEN THE PANDEMIC AND THEN THE LACK OF ACCESS TO TRAUMA AND CULTURALLY PROFICIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO AS AN ORGANIZATION IN APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WE LAUNCHED INITIATIVE HEALTH INITIATIVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SILICON VALLEY BLACK LEADERSHIP KITCHEN CABINET THE SILICON VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION CALLED COVERT NINETEEN BLACK. OUR GOAL WAS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF COVERT NINETEEN AND REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE DEADLY VIRUS WITHIN THE AFRICAN ANSWERS TO COMMUNITY WE CREATED A NARRATIVE THAT WE TOLD OUR OWN STORIES VIDEO COLLAGES OF OUR YOUNG FOLKS TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTED THEM. AND HOW DO WE PRODUCE HOW DO WE- REDUCE THE SPREAD SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY IS EDUCATED NOT ON WHAT WE SEE ON SOCIAL MEDIA NOT ON THE FALLACIES NANA WHAT THEY HEARD THE BARBERSHOP BUT WHERE THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT IT. WE LOST IS INITIATIVE THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA. AND WE LAUNCHED IT WITH A TOWN HALL EVENT THAT HAD OVER TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE. AGAIN OUR GOAL WAS LET LET LET OUR YOUNG FOLKS TELL THE STORIES. ABOUT THE TRUCE AND THE FACTS ABOUT KOBE NINETEEN. WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE BACKPACKS OF TRAUMA BECAUSE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR KIDS AND OUR YOUNG FOLKS IN PARTICULAR AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO ARE OVER REPRESENTED IN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED IN EVERY LEVEL OF OUR SYSTEM. THE BACKPACKS OF TRAUMA FROM EDUCATION TO HEALTH. TO LEGAL TO HOUSING- THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT IMPACT AND WEIGH HEAVY ON OUR COMMUNITIES ON COVERT HIT IT WAS LIKE A TWELVE ROUND BOXING MATCH AND HERE COMES MIKE TYSON AND THIRTEENTH ROUND. AND IT WAS A KNOCKOUT BLOW. SO FOR US THIS WAS ABOUT EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF HEALTH AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO STRING THING AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS FOR OURSELVES SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY. CAN PROTECT OURSELVES AND PROTECT ELEVEN SO FAR YOUNG BLACK AND OUR YOUNG MEN OF COLOR AFRICAN AMERICAN- AND EMERGING ADULTS. WITHOUT EDUCATION THEY ARE LEFT TO LEAN ON INFORMATION THAT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA OFTENTIMES WE KNOW IS NOT NOT CORRECT OR IS MISLEADING BECAUSE OF THE CENTURIES OF INEQUALITIES THAT HAVE IMPACTED HOW WE BELIEVE AND TRUST IN OUR SYSTEMS. THAT HAVE FAILED US FOR CENTURIES AND SO THIS INITIATIVE HAS BEEN A MAJOR IMPACT TO OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE OUR FOLKS HAVE EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO MAKE THE PROPER DECISIONS. DO WE GET ACCESS OR DO WE NOT WE SEE THIS WE SEE THE SPIKE RIGHT NOW- THAT'S THE REALITY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH OUR PROGRAMS. SO WE HAVE TRAINED THERAPISTS THAT FOCUS ON CULTURALLY COMPETENT- THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS- WE HAVE HOUSING THAT LOOK THAT IS THROUGHOUT NINE DIFFERENT VERY COUNTIES WE HOUSE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY YOUNG FOLKS- IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS WE OFFER. CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT THE FOCUS ON THEIR EDUCATION THEIR EMPLOYMENT SO THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF GETTING CONNECTED TO AND SEE A VISION OF THEMSELVES NOT WHAT IT WAS YESTERDAY BUT WHAT THE VISION CAN LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE. ALSO HOW DO WE DO WITH THE TRAUMA THAT OFTENTIMES WE DON'T THINK ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT WE JUST SHOW UP AND DO THINGS AND ALL REALIZE THAT'S BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL TRAUMA AND HOW IS IT SHOW UP TODAY. AND THEN HOW WE WORK FOR EMPLOYERS OR EMPLOYERS UNDERSTAND HOW TO ENGAGE WITH A YOUNG PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYONE TO CALL ON A SUNDAY AT. AT SIX O'CLOCK TO HELP THEM WITH A WITH A FLAT TIRE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FAMILY STRUCTURE OR THOSE LEVELS OF SUPPORT CENTER IN PLACE. SO OUR PROGRAM IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING SURE WE GIVE OUR YOUNG FOLKS A VISION FOR WHAT THE FUTURE COULD LOOK LIKE AND HOW DO WE THEN ACCESS THAT. AND WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW TRAUMA SHOWS UP IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE BUT OFTEN TIMES IT JUST BECOMES. A COMMON PRACTICE OF HOW HOW THEY DEAL WITH THE LOSSES THAT IF EXPERIENCED GOING UP TO THE FAUCET. SYSTEM SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS MOMENT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY GET ENOUGH ALLOW UNITY HERE TO SPEAK WHAT'S PROGRAMS. AND I'LL NOW TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE PANEL. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN JAMES JONES. SAWYER AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JOSE FEET OUT ABOUT OTHER MEN THAT AND IT'S BEEN MY HONOR TO LEAD THE WORK OF SAFE PASSAGES FOR THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND IT'S MY HONOR TO DATE TODAY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. OUR ORGANIZATION IS A MULTI SERVICE ORGANIZATION LOCATED IN OAKLAND ASSEMBLY DISTRICT EIGHTEEN. LED BY WOMEN OF COLOR WITH OVER TWENTY SIX YEARS OF DEMONSTRATED EFFECTIVE SERVICE TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN OAKLAND OTHER HIGH NEED AREAS OF ALAMEDA COUNTY. WE DELIVER A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF CULTURALLY RELEVANT SERVICES TO OVER FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN YOUTH AND FAMILIES EACH YEAR. OUR LAW AND SOCIAL JUSTICE LIFE COACHING PROJECT. AND GET ACTIVE PROGRAMS OUR COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICES ARE LIFE COACHING PROJECT IS ONE OF THE THIRTY FIVE. COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE PRACTICE IS FUNDED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT WITHIN THE OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THEIMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN. ON THE FAMILIES AND YOUTH THAT WE SERVE. AND THE LARGER COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN BOTH IMMEDIATE AND ACUTE. THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE SERVICE THROUGH OUR PROGRAMS LIVE IN A TEN SCHOOLS IN THE OAKLAND ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF COVERT NINETEEN INFECTION IN ALAMEDA COUNTY. THE LAUNCH ALSO JUSTICE PROJECT IS A PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT AIMS TO PREVENT. AND REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO CHRONIC STRESS INCLUDING TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH POVERTY EXPOSURE TO RACISM BEING DISENFRANCHISED AND JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM INVOLVED AMONG YOUTH OF COLOR PRIMARILY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATIN NEXT YOUTH AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE. WHO ARE JUDICATA SYSTEMS INVOLVED ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING SYSTEMS INVOLVED. THE DATA CLEARLY L. ILLUSTRATES THE EXTREME LEVEL OF POVERTY CRIME VIOLENCE DISCRIMINATION AND DISENFRANCHISEMENT EXPERIENCED BY ADJUDICATED YOUTH OF COLOR IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THE CHRONIC STRESS PRODUCED BY THESE OPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS. CHRONIC STRESS BECOMES TOXIC FOR OUR TARGET POPULATION GREATLY INCREASING THE RISK OF EXPERIENCING SYSTEMS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA. AND MENTAL ILLNESS THE LAUNCH WILL SHUT SOCIAL JUSTICE LIFE COACHING PROJECT PROVIDES EFFECTIVE TRAUMA INFORMED CULTURALLY COMPETENT LIFE COACHING TO REDUCE TOXIC STRESS LEVELS AND INCREASE SUPPORT TO MITIGATE THE PARTICIPANTS RISK ASSIST SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED. WITH THAT TRAUMA AND MENTAL ILLNESS SPECIFICALLY THE PROJECT STRIVES TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE COPING SKILLS SELF REGULATION RELATIONSHIPS WITH CARING ADULTS ACCESS TO SERVICES EMPLOYMENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. SIMPLY STATED THE PROJECT COMPONENTS ARE DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE THE STRESS AND TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEING IN THE FOSTER YOUTH JUVENILE JUSTICE AND EDUCATION SYSTEMS. THAT THE AREA OF CHANGE IS DRIVEN BY STRATEGIES TO PREVENT YOUTH AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY ONE FROM ENTERING OR RE ENTERING THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATE BUREAUCRATIC INEQUITABLE SYSTEMS. LIKE FOSTER CARE JUVENILE JUSTICE PUBLIC HEALTH HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT YOU SUCCESSFULLY EXIT THE SYSTEMS WITH THE ASSETS REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO DISRUPT THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE IN ITS LONG LASTING MENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR YOUTH OF COLOR BY PRIORITIZING RESOURCES WITHIN THE MODEL TO. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC MOBILITY THE PRO THE PROJECT HAS FIVE KEY COMPONENTS THE FIRST ONE IS OUT REACH IN COORDINATION WHICH OCCURS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS IT INCLUDES WORKING WITH PUBLIC SYSTEMS PARTNERS AS WELL AS TARGET SCHOOL COMMUNITIES OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FAMILIES. TO SUPPORT REFERRALS OF RECRUITMENT COORDINATION INTEGRATION OF SERVICES AT TARGET SCHOOLS AND IN THE COMMUNITY NUMBER TWO ENROLLMENT LIFE COACHES FOLLOW REVIEWER FOR A FOLLOW UP ON REFERRALS AND WHAT SCHOOLS COMMUNITY BASED AND SYSTEMS PARTNERS. AND WORK WITH FAMILIES PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO SCREEN FOR TRAUMA AND RELATED SYSTEMS NUMBER THREE LIFE COACHING CASE MANAGEMENT THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE YOUTH WITH THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO NAVIGATE THE MULTIPLE PUBLIC SYSTEMS THEY HAVE TO ENCOUNTER. LIKE JUVENILE JUSTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC BENEFITS HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION IN A WAY THAT EMPOWERS THEM ACTIVITIES INCLUDE COACHING MODELING FOR AND MENTORING YOUTH ACCOMPANIMENT TO PUBLIC SYSTEMS APPOINTMENTS DIRECT ASSISTANCE WITH SECURING GATEWAY DOCUMENTS LIKE DRIVER'S LICENSES BIRTH CERTIFICATES WORK PERMITS. THAT GIVE THE YOUNG PEOPLE GREATER AGENCY IN DEALING WITH PUBLIC SYSTEMS ASSISTANCE TO RECONNECT WITH-FAMILY TREATING THEM LIKE FAMILY AND CONDUCTING ONE ON ONE LIFE COACHING AND COUNSELLING SESSIONS WITH THEM. NUMBER FOUR LIFE SKILLS AND ETHNIC STUDIES INCLUDES EDUCATION ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES TO INCREASE PROTECTORS IN THE YOUNG PERSON TO COUNTER THE TOXIC STRESS PRODUCED BY THE INHERENT IN EQUITIES IN THE SYSTEMS. THAT THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH PARTICIPANTS LEARN ABOUT THEIR HISTORY CULTURE AND THE RIGHTS THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF THE SUB PUBLIC SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE TO WORK THROUGH. MANY OF THE CLASSES ARE TAUGHT THROUGH CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT THAT PROVIDES PARTICIPANTS WITH BOTH HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE CREDIT. AND THEN THE LAST COMPONENT IS FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN WITHIN THIS COMPONENT THE CORE BELIEF IS THAT THE FAMILIES THAT THAT THE FAMILY CAN BE THE CORE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. STRENGTHENING THE FAMILY SUPPORT SYSTEM IS THE BEST STRATEGY FOR TRYING TO ENSURE THAT YOUTH WILL HAVE A LIFETIME OF SUPPORT LONG AFTER PARTICIPANTS EXIT OUR PROGRAMMING AND WE KNOW THAT FAMILIES CAN NOT FULLY ENGAGING SERVICES UNLESS BASIC NEEDS ARE MET THIS IS NEVER BEEN MORE APPARENT THAN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE FAMILIES CANNOT ATTEND SCHOOL EVENTS IF HOUSING AND FOOD NEEDS ARE NOT SECURE. I'D LIKE TO JUST SHARE A COUPLE OF BRIEF OUTCOMES WE JUST COMPLETED A THREE YEAR STUDY OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH PARTICIPANTS IN WHICH SIXTY THREE PARTICIPANTS WERE FOLLOWED. A 100% OF THESE PARTICIPANTS GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND NONE OF THEM ZERO WE ENTERED OUR ENTERED THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. AND TWO RECOMMENDATIONS I WANTED TO SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND SCALABILITY IS WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TARGET. UP STATE FEDERAL RESOURCES IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WORK AND I WOULD STRONGLY INCH COURAGE THE COMMISSION THANK THE COMMITTEE THE SELECT COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT THE MENTAL SERVICE THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND THE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION REGULATIONS AND CREATE SPACE FOR COMMUNITY TO FIND. EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND ALSO TO LOOK AT THE NEW INVESTMENT IN SCHOOL BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HEALTH AND TO CONSIDER A CARVE OUT WITH IN THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT FOR YOUTH OF COLOR MARGINALIZED AND HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED WITHIN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY TO FIND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES CAN BE FUNDED THROUGH BOTH OF THESE REALLY CRITICAL. EXISTING AND NEW FUNDING SOURCES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY THANK YOU VERY BROUGH INFORMATION THANK YOU. AND NEXT IS THAT A DOCTOR BARBER. YES YEAH SURE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO. OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON IS A LIMIT OF ASTORIA I AM VERY DELIGHTED TO BE HERE AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND I AM DOCTOR JACK BARBER 'M A COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRIST AND UP CODE OF. FOUNDED THE ORGANIZATION SOME TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AGO TO SERVE OF BALD EAGLE POPULATIONS IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES ADULT. CHILDREN OLDER ADULTS AND MOST RECENTLY WITH THE EPIDEMIC OF HOMELESSNESS- OUR EMPHASIS ON THAT POPULATION AS WELL. SO I THOUGHT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU ALL TWELVE YEAR OLD BLACK YOUNG MAN NAMED MARK MARCUS WAS ABUSE. MARCUS LIVES WITH A FOSTER FAMILY WITH IT AND HAS A DEEP. YEARNING TO REUNITE REUNITE WITH HIS FAMILY HIS MOTHER IS INCARCERATED HIS FATHER'S ESTABLISHED ANOTHER FAMILY OUT OF STATE. ARGUS WAS DESPONDENT ATTITUDE OF THE SCHOOL AND THE LAST ACTION FIGURES. ARGUS RECEIVE WRAPAROUND APPROACH SERVICE WRAPAROUND IS A NATIONAL MODEL BUT IT'S A BEST PRACTICE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH THAT HAS AS ITS CORE VALUE THE CHILD AND FAMILY VOICE AND CHOICE AND SERVICES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON WHAT THE CHILD AND FAMILY WANT TO. MOST RECENTLY THIS IS KEEPING. CHILDREN IN YEARS AND THEIR HOMES AND FAMILIES AND OUR TEAM WORKS AS VICTIMS FAMILY MEMBERS. AS A TEAM APPROACH THAT INCLUDES SERVICES THAT START WITH A FACILITATE THE WORST EXPAND THE NETWORKS OF THE CHILD AND FAMILY AND HE AND THE FACILITATOR IS AWARE OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES AS FOR IT FREQUENTLY A COMMUNITY CHAMPION. IT ALSO INCLUDES A CHILD AND FAMILY THERAPIST WHO IS WELL TRAINED IN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. IT INCLUDES A VERY IMPORTANT PARA PART WHICH MEANS A SOMEBODY WHO HAS LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND IF NECESSARY. I CHILD ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRISTS. THERE IS MUCH EVIDENCE CORROBORATING THE AFFECTIVE NOUS OF YOUR SUPPORT SURPLUS DOESN'T IN FACT THERE'S EVEN STATEWIDE LEGISLATION THAT- LEGITIMIZES THE HOPE THAT WORK AS A IMPORTANT MENTAL HEALTH TEAM MEMBER IN THE ARMAMENTARIUM OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. FROM UP FOR OUR PARA PARTNERS THIS MEANS THEY HAVE HAD PERSONAL INTERACTION WITH FOSTER CARE DPSS OR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THIS MEANS THEY KNOW THE SYSTEMS FROM A LIVED EXPERIENCE POINT OF VIEW AND I CAN HELP NAVIGATE THOSE SYSTEMS. THE PROFILE OF A BLACK WRAPAROUND CHEAP AS I MENTIONED THOSE THOSE THOSE PARTICIPANTS BUT BE HAVING SOMEONE WHO LOOKS LIKE. THE CHILD ARE YOU. S. CONVERSANT WITH THE CULTURAL ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS FREQUENTLY THE PAIR TEAM IS BLACK OR BROWN HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE JOURNEY AT INDIVIDUAL ICE PLANS OF CARE ARE MONITORED. THIS THERE IS IMPORTANT FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE CHILD AND FAMILY THIS MEANS WE CAN SPEND TARGETED INTERVENTIONS. WHEN WE NEED IT. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF THE ECONOMICS AND SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS WITH HOUSING AND SECURITY FOOD SECURITY SO THAT MEANS THAT WE ACTUALLY OPERATE AS A- OFFICE FOR ON THE ON OUT ON THE ON ON THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD SO THAT HAVE SCRIPT THERE IS A HOUSING SITUATION THE NEED SAFE OUTSIDE WE ARE ABLE TO QUICKLY PROVIDE IT AND TRYING THAT IN THE COMMUNITY. ABOUT MARCUS BECAUSE HE BENEFIT FROM THE TEAM WORKING WITH THE- WITH WITH WORKING INTIMATELY WITH TEACHERS AND PROMOTING HIS ATTEMPTS. TUTORING AND MENTORING FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES BASICALLY RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES WERE CAREFULLY CRAFTED. THROUGH THROUGH THE INDIVIDUALIZED PLAN AND YOU KNOW HIS HIS DEEP AFFECTION I MUST SAY FOR ACTION FIGURES LED TO A WEEKEND TRIP TO COMIC CON WHICH NORMALIZES A LOT OF- IN OPENING THEIR BEST. SO THE WHOLE TREATMENT DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND TO SAN DIEGO TO EXPERIENCE THAT THIS IS AND WENT AND WE WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR. SO LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS FROM MARCUS THAT INCLUDE FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. DESIGNED FOR BLACK PARENTS PROJECT FATHERHOOD IS A SUPPORT GROUP AND MENTORING ORGANIZATION. THAT DISCUSSES HOW PARENTS CAN STRATEGIZE TO ORGANIZE BETTER COMMUNITY SPORTS. AFTER TWENTY PLUS YEARS MORE THAN FIFTEEN THOUSAND FATHERS HAVE PARTICIPATE. AT OUR FATHERS AND FAMILY ATTEND A WATCH PROJECT FATHER. MANY OF OUR STAFF ARE FACILITATORS AND CARD CARRYING MEMBERS OF THIS ORGANIZATION AND THEREFORE THEY- DON'T THEM AS A COMMUNITY SUPPORT. WRAPAROUND THIS IS ANOTHER PARTNER RATE UP EXPERIENCE ALL BLOOM WHICH IS CALLED BUILDING A LIFETIME OF OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN LITTLE. SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AND THE BROTHERHOOD. IT'S SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES POLICIES AND CONSCIOUS THAT LEADS TO CHRONIC JUDICIAL AND PROBATION- INVOLVEMENT AND RESHAPES THE PERCEPTION OF BLACKMAIL YOU. WITH ALL THESE INTERVENTIONS THOUGH IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR INCORPORATED INTO WRAPPED AROUND AND THE WRAPAROUND IS LIKE A HELICOPTER. YOU CAN RAISE OR LOWER ITS ALTITUDE DEPENDING ON BEHAVIOR AND IT HAS THE JET FUEL UP FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SAFE HOUSE MAKING FOOD SECURITY AND THE LIGHT. SO MARKETS DID WELL WITH THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS INVOLVED HE'S EIGHTEEN THAT. HIS VOICE AND- LED TO A GOAL TO GO TO COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ULTIMATELY HE WAS ACCEPTED TO PENN STATE. AND I HAVE NO IDEA HOW REALLY THEY THEY ALL CAME TO AFTER THAT WAS AN INTERESTING CHOICE AND THE TEAM SUPPORTED HIS DECISION. IRAN BROWN HAS PAID HIS FIRST YEAR OF TO WHICH. YOU STILL CONNECTED TO HIS FAMILY AT SHARP I WAS MADE SOME CONNECTIONS TO HIS FATHER AND HIS FOSTER PLACEMENT WAS ENHANCED BY MOMENTS OF FAMILY RESPITE. AND ECONOMIC SUPPORTS AS I'VE MENTIONED AND PLEASE KNOW THAT SAVES HOUSING. ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENT IS SUPERIOR TO RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES WHICH RANGE FROM A THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY. BEFORE I CONCLUDE MY REMARKS ABOUT MARCUS AND SPECIALIZED FOSTER CARE AND WRAPAROUND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON BLACK PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HAWKINS. THE TWENTY SIXTEEN REPORT REVEALED THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR IN HOUSE INDIVIDUALS ARE BLACK AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT. OF THE U. R. WE FEEL THAT WRAP AROUND SHOULD BE SCALED UP TO ADDRESS THE INFLOW OF OUR CHILDREN GROW HOMES LACKS SPECIALIZED FOSTER CARE CHILDREN COULD RECEIVES PURPOSES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF YOU WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IT'S THAT SAME MODEL TO REDUCE THESE NUMBERS. ANSWERED TO MAKE SOME STOPS STOPS ON THE HIGHWAY BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS AND SPECIALIZED FOSTER CARE AND INCARCERATION. BECAUSE THERE IS THIS DESTRUCTIVE AND LOOK THAT UP THAT IS VERY STIRRING TO THE SLOW. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WELL IN OUR FINAL PANELIST IS DR YUTAKA SPRINGER. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON- DR YUTAKA SPRINGER AND THE CLINICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR AND A PSYCHOLOGIST AT NATIVE AMERICAN HEALTH CENTER- WE'RE IN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER- IN SAN FRANCISCO AN OPEN SERVING ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE- PER YEAR. THESE ARE MOSTLY- LOW INCOME MEDICAL RECIPIENTS- AND MANY WOULD ASSUME BY OUR NAME THAT WE SERVE ONLY NATIVE AMERICAN- COMMUNITY MEMBERS BUT- CERTAINLY IT'S A VERY DIVERSE- BY COP BY PA COMMUNITY THAT WE SERVE- I OUR GREATEST SEGMENT IS LATIN ACTS- AND THEN FOLLOWED BY A MIXTURE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE AND- RECENTLY IMMIGRATED ASIANS- THAT WITH ABOUT A PROBABLY ABOUT 15% ACTUALLY- AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES- SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- TO PREVENTION PROGRAMS IN OUR COMMUNITY WELLNESS DEPARTMENT HEADED BY SOME AMAZING LEADERS- INTER AGENCY. THAT ARE EFFECTIVE IN REACHING OUR BY PARK MEN AND BOYS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RISKS- AND MANY OF WHOM ARE DISENFRANCHISED AND NOT CONNECTING WITH- CLINICAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES THOSE KIND OF ONE ON ONE- COUNSELING SERVICES- SO THE FIRST PROGRAM IS- ARE STRONG FAMILIES- TRIBAL HOME VISITING PROGRAM THIS LED BY SHOULD BE COULD DO X. BROWN IS AMAZING- LEADER AND- IT SUPPORTS- PREGNANT. AND PARENTING FAMILIES OF NATIVE CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE- WHY ARE WE FOCUSING ON- YOUNG FAMILIES. WE KNOW THIS IS A REALLY CRITICAL PHASE- GET NEW PARENTHOOD IS A- VERY STRESSFUL AND EXPENSIVE PHASE THAT HAS LONG TERM EFFECTS ON THE NEXT GENERATION- VERY CRITICAL ATTACHMENT WINDOWS- THAT CAN IMPACT- THOSE FUTURE- GENERATIONS AND WE JUST. WANNA SHAPE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND PARENTING PRACTICES- WE HAVE A SOLID EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULUM- WE CONNECT PEOPLE TO RESOURCES HEALTH CARE SERVICES. VIOLENCE AND ADDICTION PROGRAMS- AND JUST HOLDEN SHAPE FAMILIES- SO THE NEXT GEN GENERATION AND THE COMMUNITY CAN BE HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER- AND SPECIFIC TO- FATHERS OF COLOR IN OUR PROGRAM. REALLY SEEKING TO BUILD- ADAPTIVE SUPPORTS FOR THEM LINKING FATHERS TO EACH OTHER AND REGULAR TALKING CIRCLES MEDIATED BY RESPECTED COMMUNITY ELDERS- TO DEVELOP A SUPPORT NETWORK- THE IDEA THAT FATHERHOOD IS A TYPE OF BROTHERHOOD- AND- WITH INCREASED CONNECTION- COMES INCREASED- MENTAL HEALTH AND RESILIENCY- SO PAUL MILLAR THERE SOON EXCELLENT JOB- BUT- THROUGH. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS WE'VE WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY GREAT OUTCOMES AND JUST FIND THAT- WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MORE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT THEY CAN YOU KNOW LEARN AND KEEP ADAPTIVE SKILLS- AND WE'RE WE'RE REALLY GATHERING A LOT OF DATA THERE- TO PROVE OUR OUTCOMES- THE SECOND PROGRAM I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT- IS CALED GOING OVER THE GATHERING OF NATIVE AMERICANS THIS IS- YOU KNOW DECADES- WORTH OF WORK. THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EFFECTIVE GROUP TRAINING USING INDIGENOUS METHODS SUCH AS PRAYER STORE STORYTELLING- DRUMMING TALKING CIRCLES AGAIN- OFTEN MEDIATED BY COMMUNITY ELDERS- AS ARTISTIC EXPRESSION- SO WHAT'S THE GOAL FOR THIS PROGRAM WE WANNA PARTICIPANTS- AND WE MIGHT HAVE A FOCUS ON YOUTH OR ADULTS OR THE FAMILY UNIT- TO EXPERIENCE. FOR CORE VALUES TO SEE YOU THROUGH THESE ACTIVITIES WHICH- UNFORTUNATELY- MANY HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED BEFORE BUT- BELONGING- WHICH IS A UNIVERSAL NEED THAT MANY HAVE NOT- YEAH EXPERIENCED SELF MASTERY- INTERDEPENDENCE- AND GENEROSITY SO- ARE BY PARK BEEN INVOICE YOU PARTICIPATE DESCRIBED THIS AS A VERY- POWERFUL AND CONNECTING EXPERIENCE REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE- THAT. PROMOTES A STRONG SENSE OF COMMUNITY CONNECTIVITY IN RESPONSIBILITY- WHICH THEN BUILDS STRONGER COMMUNITIES SO- AGAIN REALLY MAKING AN EFFORT TOGETHER. OUTCOME DATA- I TO. IN INCLINE TO- THE PAS BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATION IN IN GOING TO. SO WHAT YOU WHAT YOU REALLY SEE HERE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS WORKING UPSTREAM- TO REACH BY APARTMENT INVOICE- TO BUILD HEALTHIER AND MORE CONNECTED FUTURE- FOR COMMUNITIES AND HOPEFULLY PROGRAMS LIKE THESE CAN JUST CONTINUE TO IMPACT YOUR POLICY DECISIONS- INVESTING IN PREVENTION PROGRAMS OBVIOUSLY MEANS FEWER ISSUES DOWNSTREAM SO WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT TODAY A LOT OF- WISDOM HAS BEEN SHARED- AND OBSERVATIONS BUT- REALLY THE IDEA IS TO- BREAK. CYCLES OF ABUSE INTER GENERALLY INTRODUCED INTER GENERATIONALLY- VIOLENCE TRAUMA- CONNECT PEOPLE TO SUBSTANCE- PROGRAMS- ADDRESS SUICIDALITY FURTHER UPSTREAM- I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST AGAIN AND TO BE ABLE HEALTH DIRECTOR AND MY GOAL WOULD BE THAT NOBODY COMES TO MY DOOR. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK AS UPSTREAM AS POSSIBLE- AND OF COURSE THIS IN TURN SAVES- SOCIETY MONEY BUT IT'S SO MUCH MORE. THAN THAT. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I WOULD JUST BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T SAY ONE FINAL THING ABOUT TELEHEALTH- BEING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- WE REALLY SEE THIS. TECHNOLOGY IS CRITICAL- TO REACHING SECTORS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OTHERWISE- WOULD HAVE A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME CONNECTING- AND LIKE MANY WHEN WE ROLLED OUT TELEHEALTH SERVICES. AFTER THE LOCKDOWNS LAST MARCH- WE SAW A SERVICE UTILIZATION- BUT THIS WAS. DISPROPORTIONATELY LARGER- FOR MOST FINANCIALLY STRAINED UNDER RESOURCE MEMBERS SO WE ARE SEEING PEOPLE COME THROUGH OUR DOOR VIRTUALLY- AT IN OVER MAINTAINED. THROUGHOUT OUR- MAINTENANCE OF- TELEHEALTH SERVICES- THAT JUST SPEAKS TO THE CONVENIENCE- OF THE SAFETY AND THE EFFECTIVE- EFFECTIVENESS OF GETTING THESE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH THIS SO. I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THE LEGISLATURE- FOR APPROVING UTILIZATION OF TELEHEALTH SERVICES THROUGH. TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH THE CONTINUED WAIVER. THANK YOU- ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OUT AND I WILL JUST ADD TO THE TELEHEALTH. OF DURING THE PANDEMIC- IN MY COMMUNITY AND MISS CAREERS COMMUNITY- WE HAVE CLINICS WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A WHOLE LOT HOSPITALS. IN OUR CLINICS HAD THE BURDEN OF- DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE AND WE FOUND THAT- I TELL HEALTH SERVICES LIKE ESPECIALLY MY DISTRICT WE'RE IN A LOT OF THE CLINICS ARE GETTING TWENTY CALLS. YOU KNOW A MONTH SHOT UP TO TWO THOUSAND. IN IT LIKE THE FIRST MONTH OF THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S BEEN INCREASING AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE OBVIOUSLY. THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN THEY COULD BEFORE AND SO- WE PROBABLY DO NEED TO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THIS TELEHEALTH FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THAT THAT MAY BE A SAVING GRACE I MEAN IF. IT DEPICTS BEEN A PROBLEM BUT- THIS TELEHEALTH THEY COULD BE SOMETHING. THAT COULD TAKE US IN IN PLACES THAT WE NEVER KNEW BEFORE IT COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO THANK YOU AND THEN. JUST JUST FOR ME TO DECIDE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND SINCE WE GOT SO MANY DOCTORS HERE RIGHT NOW- MENTAL HEALTH VERSUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. WHAT'S IS THERE A DIFFERENCE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE OR READ. ANYWAY ANYBODY CAN TAKE- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- ZERO HEALTH I THINK THERE'S BEEN MORE OF A SHIFT TOWARD AGAIN LIKE MEASUREMENT AND QUANTIFICATION THAT'S EASIER TO DO WITH BEHAVIOR THAN MENTAL PROCESSES WHICH I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE- MIGHT SAY OUR- LOOK A LITTLE HARDER TO OBSERVE OR QUANTIFY- THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE ONE THING BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THOUGHTS ARE SO LINKED TO BEHAVIORS AND WE WANT TO BE AS OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE- REALLY KIND OF FOCUSING ON BEHAVIOR. CAN TAKE A- THIS ALSO REALLY SIMPLE EXPLANATION OF PEOPLE SAY MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN THEIR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND SO WHEN YOU SAY MENTAL HEALTH OR NOT INCLUDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THOSE. THIRTY EASIER WAY TO ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AN INDIVIDUAL DOESN'T JUST. HALF OF THEM SUFFERS FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND HALF OF THEM SUFFERS FROM A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IT'S THAT ONE PERSON IN COUNTERING ALL OF THAT. IT'S A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OF THE NOT RECOGNIZING THE WHOLE PERSON- WHAT THEY EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION. OF THE DURING QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MISTER KALRA. YEAH THIS IS- LIKE ALL OF YOU A HUGE CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON THE APRIL ESPECIALLY ON COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY TEND TO HAVE GREATER TRAUMA. CERVANTES AUDREY MY LIVING AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER WHEN IT WITH ANY MY CLIENTS IF YOU DIG DEEP INTO THEIR HISTORY YOU'LL SEE MANY POINTS OF TRAUMA THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THEIR YOUTH. DEGREE MONTHS OF AUSTRIA. IS MISS CHAPMAN OWNS AND- BUT BUT THERE ARE A GOING BACK TO THAT WAS ON THERE ARE SIX MODEL. OF YOU KNOW CARE'S ONE ARE NONE OF ANY YEARS BUT IT'S A VERY. EXPENSIVE TO DO ALL RIGHT YOU CAN'T DO THIS WORK ON THE CHEAP. AND SO- AB AND ADDING TELEHEALTH IS A OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT RIGHT IN A WAY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE JUST LIKE A- WITH THE CHAMBERS MANAGING MY DISTRICT AS WELL AS WAS MOSTLY CLINICS DOTTED RATHER HIM BE SOLDERING THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT COMES TO TESTING VACCINATIONS THEY DIDN'T START THE CLINICS THE END OF THE CLAIM WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE STARTED IN THE CONTEXT THAT'S NOT HOT WE GOTTA DO THIS RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE INVESTING THIS MUCH AND IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. I'M NOT JUST A SUPPLEMENT FOR THOSE THAT ALREADY HAVE TO GET TO THOSE THAT THAT DON'T AND I THINK THAT- THE INVESTMENT IS GOT TO BE CONSISTENT- IT'S GONNA BE PAYING- BECAUSE AGAIN- IT DIVERSE FROM WHAT OTHERWISE IS GOING TO BE A FAR MORE COSTLY OUTCOME- WHETHER IT'S HOMELESSNESS WEATHER'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE AND IT REALLY LEADS TO THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL YOU HELP TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES THE YOUNGER AGE AND THEN SUCH. AND SET SOMEONE UP FOR THAT CAREER PATH GOING FORWARD AND SO IT'S ABOUT TWENTY INVEST IN THE RIGHT PLACES AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF YOUR DUES. THANK YOU. THIS CARILLO. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. LOOKING THING ON. A THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENT- I WANT TO PUT ON ON YOUR RADAR. THAT I'M ACTUALLY I'M ACTUALLY RUNNING A BILL ITS AB FOUR SIXTY TWO- LICENSE CLINICAL COUNSELORS. IT'S THE IT'S THE EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR- THE TREATMENT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH WHICH I JUST SHARED. WE KNOW THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MOST TRAUMA UNDER COBIT. ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS. WHERE ESSENTIAL IN FRONT LINE WORKERS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED THE MOST ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE. LATINO OR BLACK OR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE SOME OF THE BARRIERS. FOR LICENSED CLINICAL COUNSELORS TO BE ABLE TO TREAT. FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED- A SCOPE OF SERVICES. ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR- BE THE BARRIERS OF ENTRY TO RECEIVE CARE TO BE REDUCED. AND SO- FOR FOLKS OUT THERE IN THE COMMUNITY HOPEFULLY. THIS MAKES IT UP TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND GET TO SIGNATURE SO THAT WE CAN. NOT ONLY TALK ABOUT PROVIDING THE RESOURCES BECAUSE WITH THE PUT AS MUCH MONEY AS WE WANTED TO- ALEC L. A. COUNTY SPECIFICALLY FROM FOR ME AND FOR THE CHAIR. BUT WITHOUT THE PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK THAT MONEY JUST SITS THERE. AND DOESN'T GET UTILIZED AND SO WE NEED THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP- THE TREATMENT- IN ADDITION TO THE STIGMA. ASSOCIATED AROUND MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE- ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING REALLY HARD TO ENSURE THAT. MENTAL HEALTH IS PART OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITHIN SCHOOLS. SO AND ONLY WITH THE SPECIFICALLY- CREATING THE MODEL FOR COMMUNITY CLINICS OR I'M SORRY COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL APPROACH. IN WHICH THESE RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE. AT THE AT THE SCHOOL SITE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S WHERE IT WHETHER IT'S FROM ELEMENTARY ALL THE WAY UP TO HIGH SCHOOL WE KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE. CHILDREN. FEEL THE SAFEST THERE AMONG SIR. THEIR MONSTER TEACH. AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT- ESPECIALLY AS WE RETURNED. BACK TO SCHOOL AND SO EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO THAT SUPPORTS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING TO BRING. THESE RESOURCES OUT INTO COMING INTO THE COMMUNITY- IT'S CRITICAL. AND SO IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL IDEAS AS TO WHAT IT IS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- HERE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WERE OPEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE FOLKS ON THE GROUND. THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING THE WORK NECESSARY AND- I JUST WANT TO GIVE A PERSONAL SHOUT OUT TO. MY SISTER MY SISTER'S A WRAPAROUND SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER WITH FOSTER CHILDREN. AND WITH THAT AND HOST FAMILIES THAT ARE RECENTLY PLACED AN PROJECT ROOM HERE PROJECT KAMKE. HER ROLE LIKE MANY YOUNG WOMEN AND WOMEN OF COLOR IS TO GO TO THE DOORS. THE HOMES OF THESE FAMILIES AND JUST CHECK IN ON THEM. AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SAFE BUT THEY HAVE RESOURCES- AND ULTIMATELY I THINK WHAT WE NEED IS A PLAN. IN WHICH- THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS O THE VACCINE. MY SISTER HAS TOLD ME STORIES OF VISITING FAMILIES OF A SINGLE MOM WITH. FIVE CHILDREN UNDER NINE WHO'S LIVING ON THE BRINK OF. A POVERTY AND WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CAR RELIES ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND A LACK OF CHILD CARE HAS NOT. GIVEN HER THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE VACCINE PUTTING HERSELF AND HER CHILDREN. ADD ADDITIONAL RISKS AND WE KNOW THAT THAT IS EXACTLY. THE SITUATION THAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MOST MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES- AND WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO CONNECT THE DOTS AND CONNECT PEOPLE TO THE RESOURCES. THAT ARE AVAILABLE BUT MAYBE NOT AVAILABLE RIGHT AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ACCESS. AND SELF THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO AND TO EVERYONE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THAT'S- KNOCKING ON DOORS THAT'S TRYING TO GET RESOURCES AS TRYING TO. EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO RISK. CARE AND TO TRUST ULTIMATELY AMID COBIT- THAT THE VACCINE IS FREE. IT IS SAFE. NO ONE IS GOING TO ASK FOR YOUR LEGAL STATUS. AND THAT ULTIMATELY IT'LL HELP SAVE LIVES AND WE KNOW THAT IT IS OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE SUFFERING THE MOST AND WE NEED TO DO ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES ARE SAFE THE STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL SAFELY THAT THEY ARE IF YOU'RE TWELVE AND OVER THE YOU CAN GET THE VACCINE AS WELL- AND THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE POSSIBLY CAN TO ENSURE THAT. WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU INTERNET COME AFTER MYSTICAL THING THANK YOU THIS AMERICAN DO A MENTION PROJECT ONE CAN AS I JUST WANT TO MENTION EXCITED I'M FLUID UNIQUE AND I THINK OTHERS MAYBE. IN SOME OF ITS RATIONS BUT OVER THE YEARS. UNOCAL'S GALLAGHER HOUSE MANY MANY MANY FOSTER YOUTH. IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE MARKET IN THE NATION. AND I MENTION THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE ARE PUTTING THIS MONEY. FROM YOU KNOW BEFORE HOUSING HOUSING THE HOMELESS HOUSING THOSE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. WHAT IS THE- BEST WAY. OR HOW WOULD YOU FRAME- OUR- OUR ARM. THE METHODOLOGY OF GETTING RESOURCES DOWN THAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER. OF HOMES AND BUILDINGS. ABLE TO GET AND CONVERT INTO HOUSING. IT'S AMERICA I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY AND YOU KNOW I MEAN I'VE BEEN DOING THIS TWENTY YEARS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME IN A LESS. PROBABLY FOR YEARS. THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND FOSTER CARE BECAUSE I TALKED TO HIM THROUGH THE LENS OF HOUSING. EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THERE'S A HOUSING CRISIS WERE MEASURED YOUNG PERSON IN FOSTER CARE. THAT- DOESN'T HAVE A FAMILY SUPPORTS- LEAST FOSTER CARE. DOES HAVE A PLACE TO GO AND SO. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE- YOU KNOW OUR OUR DEVELOPERS. ARE A FOUNDATION PARTNERS. ARE GOVERNMENT PARTNERS AND OUR CORPORATIONS TO COME TOGETHER AND STRATEGIZE ON WAYS THAT WE CAN CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR YOUNG FOLKS AND- WE DID THAT IN OUR PROJECT- PROJECT SAFE IT WITH MID PENN WE GET CARVE OUTS- IN MID PENN COMMUNITIES FOR SET ASIDES- CYST SPECIFICALLY FOR KIDS IN FOSTER CARE. AND BEING ABLE TO CHARGE THEM. WHAT I CALL WHAT pWE WOULD DO A PHONE KIDS THEY PAY FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS A MONTH FOR FIVE YEARS. SO FROM AGE TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY SIX. THEY HAVE IT UP TO GIVE DEVELOPING GROWING AND MATURING LIKE ALL OF OUR YOUNG ADULTS DO THAT THAT LEAVE OUR HOMES AS KIDS. AND NOT HAVE THE BURDEN OF. THE OR THE OR THE CRISIS OF THE STRESS LEVEL OF NOT HAVING A PLACE TO LIVE. BECAUSE FOR MANY YOUNG FOLKS TO. THEY GO UP YOU KNOW IN TWENTY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS TWENTY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES GOING TO TWENTY DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. FINALLY GIVEN TO A PLACE OF STABILITY IS A PLACE THAT THEY COULD FILL HOPE AND THEREFORE WORK ON THEIR- OWN SELF HELP AND WORK ON THEIR EDUCATION GOING TO SCHOOL. AND REALLY DEALING WITH THE TRAUMAS OF REALLY GOING THROUGH THAT SYSTEM BEING SEPARATE FROM FAMILIES. THERE ARE SOME GOOD MODELS OUT THERE PROJECTS SAFE HAVEN SECONDLY COMMITTEE FOUNDATION CAME UNDER REPORT ON IT'S ON THE WEBSITE. AND AGAIN IT LEVERAGES OUR DEVELOPERS LEVERAGES OUR NONPROFITS THAT LEVERAGES OUR CORPORATE PARTNERS AND OUR CITY COUNTY- PROVIDERS TO COME TOGETHER AND REALLY DEVELOP A STRATEGY. THAT WE CAN GIVE FOLKS A COULD. ON HOUSING. EVEN IN THE MOST X. MARKET RIGHT. MARKET SOME YOU KNOW MANY OF US HAVE YOUNG FOLKS WENT OFF TO COLLEGE AND THEY'RE LIVING HERE BECAUSE WE HELP THEM OUT. OUR PHONES YOU DON'T HAVE THAT SO THIS IS THE WAY. THE COMMUNITY CAN WEIGH AND LEAD IN AND HELP HELP- GIVE ACCESS AND THAT'S IF YOU. HAVE BEEN PROJECT IN PARTICULAR. THAT PROGRAM IS. A CERTAIN FIXED NUMBER OF UNITS IN A LARGER AFFORDABLE HOUSING. DEVELOPMENT OR OR YEAH. I MEAN ABSOLUTELY I THINK WHAT WE ALWAYS LOOK AT IS WHEN YOU SEE A YOUNG FOLKS OFF TO COLLEGE LIVE IN THE DORMS. TWO YEARS AT THAT THE TO GO LIVE IN SURE HOMES AND EVENTUALLY GOT THEIR OWN APARTMENTS- CREATING THAT HOUSING CONTINUUM. AND LEVERAGING DEVELOPERS TO SAY. IN ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR EVEN EXISTED ONCE DOOR CARVE OUT GIVE US TEN UNITS SET ASIDE. SPECIFICALLY FOR KIDS IN FOSTER CARE. AND LET US COME TOGETHER AND PAY THAT RENT FOR THAT YOUNG PERSON BE THERE FOR FIVE YEARS. JUST AS WE WOULD DO FOR YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER GOES OFF TO COLLEGE IT IS A- GREAT MODEL WE HAVE GREAT OUTCOMES ON THAT MODEL AND WE'RE DEL SCALING THAT- THROUGHOUT THE AREA. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT EXPLANATION THANK YOU. JUST ONE PIECE I WOULD ADD IS THAT IT I THINK SOMETIMES WE THINK ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS IN ISOLATION OF THE ALL OF THE OTHER ONES AND SO A SUCCESSFUL HOUSING STRATEGY HAS TO BE. AN INTERSECTING STRATEGY AND SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT NOT JUST A HOUSING PROBLEM IT'S AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROBLEM IS AN EDUCATION. C. ISSUES IN THAT INTERSECTION WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY OF THEM ON THEIR OWN. THANK YOU WE- I'LL JUST ADD ONE MORE COMMENT ON HOUSING AND SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS GOING TO FACE VERY SOON AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT IN IN BUDGET NEXT YEAR MOVING FORWARD- SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO FACE IN LOS ANGELES VERY SOON AS THE- AT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COVENANTS THAT. ARE SET TO EXPIRE WITHIN FIFTY FIVE YEARS WILL BE EXPIRING. VERY SOON WITHIN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WHICH IS GOING TO DISPLACE FAMILIES IS GOING TO DISPLACE. CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE. AND SO WE NEED THE ADVOCACY WORK TO ENSURE THAT. THE CUT THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COVENANTS ACROSS THE STATE AND SPECIFICALLY IN AREAS- THAT ARE HIGHLY EXPENSIVE LIKE THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND OTHER AREAS. THAT WE MAINTAIN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH. WE'RE MOVING LEGISLATION RIGHT NOW TO ENSURE THAT. THE WOULD- MAKE IT UNDERSTANDABLE FOR A LOCAL CITY A LOCAL MUNICIPALITY TO EXPAND BEYOND THE FIFTY FIVE YEARS THAT ARE MANDATED BY THE STATE. IF THEY WANT TO DO ONE HUNDRED THEY ABSOLUTELY CAN. BUT FOR THE ONES THAT ARE ALREADY EXISTING THAT ARE EXPIRING. YOUR ADVOCACY YOUR SUPPORT- TOWARD THOSE THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COVENANTS THAT ARE SENT TO BE EXPIRING WILL ALSO BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL. AND I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL NUMBER TWO- JUST BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE IT WAS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. NATURAL BRING A PANEL NUMBER THREE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CAREER PATHWAYS IN GENERATIONAL WEALTH. BUILDING AND BUY POT COMMUNITIES. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDES MORE THAN ONE BILLION. IT WOULD BE. FORCE PACIFIC COOLEY FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. IF AND IF WE ADD THE FUNDS DIRECTED TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE. THE BUDGET INVEST MORE THAN FIVE BILLION WITH A B. IN OUR WORKERS AND LOCAL ECONOMY. BUT WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR MEN BOYS WOMEN OF COLOR WE KNOW THAT EVEN WITH THIS STATE INVESTMENT RELY ON INDUSTRY. TO PROVIDE JOBS FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THEMSELVES AND THE COMMUNITY. TO DATE WE'VE ASKED OUR PANELISTS TO DISCUSS INVESTMENT. IN MEANINGFUL CAREER PATHWAYS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND HOW WE CAN TRULY GENERATE. GENERATIONAL WEALTH- SO WE LIKE TO CALL TERROR GREAT.

WHEN LOOKING AT OUR CHALLENGES FACING BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR ARMY IN WEALTH BUILDING AND PROSPERITY I CAN THINK OF SEVERAL IMPEDIMENTS TO SUCCESS MANY WE HEARD ON EARLIER AND PANELS I'M I THINK OF CAREER PATHWAYS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION AND I SEE NATURAL INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN UNDERSERVED YOUTH AND THE WORK OF MY OFFICE AND OTHER OFFICES WITH AND THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES I'M FACING POISONED AND THAT MEN OF COLOR STEM FROM ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND LACK OF INVESTMENT FOR YEARS PRIOR TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. THE PANDEMIC INDUCED ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE HAVE EXACERBATED THOSE ISSUES WITH MANY- BUSINESSES CLOSING THEIR DOORS AND ROUGHLY 40% OF BLACK AND WHITE NEXT BUSINESSES CLOSED. THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT IS STARTER LEADERSHIP- BOTH IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE CREATED ACCESS TO PROGRAMS RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO HELP WITH ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND MAKE AN IMPACT ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FACING BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. FOR EXAMPLE I MY OFFICE IS ADMINISTERING- THE LARGEST SMALL BUSINESS FOCUSED BUDGET IN THE HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT FOR BILLION IN COULD BE NINETEEN RELIEF FOR SMALL BUSINESSES FIFTY MILLION IN RELIEF FOR MICRO BUSINESSES WHICH IS THE SMALLEST OF SMALL BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN FIVE EMPLOYEES AND UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN.

EMPLOY PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT TRANSLATES TO OPPORTUNITY FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR YOUNG ADULTS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MEET THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO GAIN VALUABLE WORK EXPERIENCE AND SKILLS. DUE TO A IO'S TAPESTRY REPORTS ARE PUBLISHED A FEW YEARS AGO FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE FASTEST WAY TO BUILD WEALTH BLACK ENTREPRENEURS FOR EXAMPLE ARE WEALTHIER THAN THEIR NON ENTREPRENEURIAL COUNTERPARTS SILVA KEYED TO BUILDING WEALTH FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IS TO BUILD BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND THAT REQUIRES SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT IS INCLUSIVE AND FOCUSED ON UNDERSERVED GROUPS WE'VE SEEN THIS PAST YEAR EXACTLY HOW POWERFUL OUR SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE NETWORK IS THEY INCREASE THEIR INTAKE WITH SMALL BUSINESSES AND MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED PARTNERS PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES APPLYING FOR REEF RELIEF GRANT MONIES. IN THIRTEEN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES WE NOW HAVE THE INTEGRATED AND COORDINATED BACKBONE TO CONTINUE THINKING INCLUSIVELY AND DELIVERING SUPPORT AS OUR ECONOMY BUILDS BACK BETTER WITH EVEN GREATER SMALL BUSINESS CAPACITY AND GROWTH ACROSS THE STATE. AS WE CONTINUED TO FUND THAT NETWORK WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALL SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING FOUNDERS OF COLOR. ADDITIONALLY THE NEW CALIFORNIA DREAM FUND WHICH IS A SMALL BUSINESS START UP GRANT PROGRAM THAT WILL MAKE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AVAILABLE TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAVE COMPLETED AND APPROVED ENTREPRENEURIAL SMALL BUSINESS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM IS THE PATHWAY TO OPPORTUNITY AND WEALTH BUILDING IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. ARE I HAD PROGRAM WHICH WE HAVE PLANNED TO RE LAUNCH- THAT WITH A TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN INCLUSIVE INNOVATION HUBS.

RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS THROUGH COBIZ THE COMMUNITY AND REINVESTMENT GRANT CANNABIS EQUITY PROGRAM I THINK SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CENTER AND I THINK DISASTER RELIEF LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM AND OF COURSE THE CALIFORNIA REBUILDING FIND SO FROM MY VANTAGE POINT AS OUR DIRECTOR OF CALLAWAY'S BA I SEE ALL OF THESE RESOURCES AND SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE THREE DISTINCT THREE DISTINCT AREAS OF IMPACT FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. THE FIRST ERROR YET OF IMPACT IS REALLY UPSCALE. UPSKILLING EXCUSE ME.

THIRD AN OPPORTUNITYTO CREATE SYSTEMIC ECONOMIC MOBILITY WHICH UTILIZES EXISTING PROGRAMS TO DEAL WITH BARRIERS TO FINANCIAL SUCCESS THERE ARE OFTEN EXPERIENCE BY UNDERSERVED GROUPS DID IT ZIP CODE RACE AND GENDER DISPARITIES THAT TO YOU THIS MORNING UNTIL- SO THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND- IF THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP TODAY THANK YOU IN A MOMENT THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SHOULD LOOKING AT MICHAEL BUSINESSES AND I ALSO WANT TO. BRING REALLY SALINAS THE CHIEFS ACROSS OF LOS ANGELES AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I PUBLICLY THANK YOU FOR WHEN DURING THE PANDEMIC WHAT I BROUGHT TO YOU THAT MICROCASSETTE SIS- STREET VENDORS IMMIGRANT VENDORS.

THE MICRO BUSINESSES ARE THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN MY DISTRICT AND SELECTED THANK YOU FOR MAKING SURE THAT THE CHAMBER. TOOK CARE THEM TOO BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE BIG LOBBYISTS AND PEOPLE COME UP HERE TO SPEAK ON YOUR BEHALF SO. SO THANK YOU FOR PROTECTING THEM GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND YOU'LL SEE THAT- I WILL MAKE REFERENCE TO THAT AS WELL BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PART. OF OUR ECONOMY AND LOS ANGELES THE CAN NOT BE X. FROM. ANYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY- BUT GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS MARIA SALINAS I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE LOS ANGELES AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO JOIN THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE STATUS OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR- MORE IMPORTANTLY I'M THE MOTHER OF FOUR BOYS SO THIS TOPIC IS VERY MUCH NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART. KNOWING THAT MY OWN CHILDREN AND WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPART ON THEM. THROUGH MY LEARNING- HAS HELPED THEM MAKE IT ON THEIR WAY I THINK OF THOSE YOUNG MEN AND BOYS THAT- DON'T HAVE MAYBE THAT PARENTAL SUPPORT AND NEED THE GUIDANCE SO THANK YOU FOR CONVENING US TODAY. THE CHAMBER REPRESENTS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT SUPPORTS THE REGIONAL ECONOMY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA pCONSISTING OF FIVE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES LA ORANGE COUNTY VENTURA SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE. YOU ALL KNOW THAT LOS ANGELES IS A VERY DYNAMIC ECONOMY THAT RECEIVED THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES AND MICRO ENTERPRISES ALIKE. THE CHAMBER IS FOCUSED FOR MANY YEARS NOT ONLY ON ENSURING THE GROWTH OF THIS ECONOMY. BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT WE HAVE AN EQUITABLE ECONOMY AND THAT IT'S AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE SMALLEST OF ENTERPRISES THE MICRO ENTERPRISES EQUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DYNAMICS NOTICES SOME OF THIS REGION. WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE LARGEST CONCENTRATION OF MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES IN THE COUNTRY. IN FACT IN LA COUNTY ALONE 93% OF BUSINESSES HAVE LESS THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES. AND WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THOSE BUSINESSES ARE RUN BY BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARMED MEN OF COLOR. THE LA CHAMBER IS FOCUSED NOT ONLY ON THE PUBLIC POLICY THAT WILL SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS GROWTH AND THEY'RE ON TO PUSH YOUR DREAMS. BUT IT HELPS BUILD OUT AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NEEDED SO THAT THESE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THE BOYS AND MEN AND- AND MEN OF COLOR ARE INCLUDED IN THIS NEW ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING. WE LEVERAGE MUCH OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THIS ODD TO US THROUGH THE STATE MANY THAT WERE JUST SO ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED BY MR LYNN GRAY. IT IS REALLY WITH THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE WITH GO BIZ AND THAT- OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE THAT WE CAN PARTNER COLLABORATE AND REALLY ACHIEVE SOME REALLY GREAT OUTCOMES SO I DO NOT WANT IT- LEFT GOING ON WITHOUT SAYING THAT THAT PARTNERSHIP IS KEY TO THE LOS ANGELES AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE KNOW THAT PERSONS OF COLOR ARE INCREDIBLY ENTREPRENEURIAL AND WHY IS THAT. IS BECAUSE MANY TIMES THEY ARE FACING SYSTEMIC BARRIERS IN NORMAL EMPLOYMENT. AND THEY ARE VERY RESOURCES FULL AND ARE LOOKING FOR THEIR WAY TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND MANY TIMES THAT MEANS AND STARTING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. IN RECOGNIZING THAT WE KNOW AT THE LA CHAMBER THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CHAMPION ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A MEANS OF ECONOMIC MOBILITY. WE KNOW THAT IT MEANS THAT WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING AND DO SUPPORT WORK PAID WORK BASED LEARNING INITIATIVES. TO ENSURE THAT BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR UNDERSTAND THE CAREER OPTIONS THE CAREER PATHWAYS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THE CHAMBER HAS A LONG HISTORY OF CHAMPIONING AN INCLUSIVE AN ECONOMY AND ONES THAT WORKS- WITH PARTNERING WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN FACT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE L. A. CHAMBER WORKS VERY CLOSELY IS WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. IN LA ALONE THERE ARE NINE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT FOCUS ON VARIOUS TRADES AND SKILLS WE BRING THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE PARTNER WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AND TOGETHER WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN YIELD AN OUTCOME OF BRINGING- BRINGING THAT THE FUTURE WORK FORCE ALONG WITH THE TRAITS AND SKILLS THAT ARE KEY AND IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY. IT IS OUR GOAL TO ENSURE THAT LARGE AND SMALL EMPLOYERS FROM THIS REGION HAVE THAT TALENT THAT IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO INNOVATE AND CREATE JOBS. THE FUTURE IS ABOUT INNOVATION THE FUTURE IS ABOUT JOB CREATION. AND AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMY WILL GROW SO WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US IS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WILL WE INCLUDE EVERYONE. WILL THIS BE AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AS WE EMERGE FROM THIS PANDEMIC THAT'S THE CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US THAT'S WHAT WE MUST FIGURE OUT TO ENSURE THAT BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. THAT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE REPRESENTED THROUGHOUT OUR GREAT STATE CAN PARTICIPATE IN THE FUTURE GROWTH OF THIS ECONOMY. THE CHAMBER HAS TWO PROGRAMS IN PARTICULAR THAT I WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE CALL THEM PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT HELP CREATE CAREER PATHWAYS. ONE IS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BUSINESS OWNERS. WHO RECEIVE MENTORSHIP TRAINING AND MATCH MAKING OPPORTUNITY FOR THEIR BUSINESSES TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO GROW. MANY OF TIMES IT RELATES TO THE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES. THE STATE LAUNCHED AN INITIATIVE OF SOURCE LOCAL SOURCE DIVERSE WE ARE THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES FOR THAT PROGRAM. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT OF LARGE ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE PURCHASING THAT THROUGH THEIR OWN PURCHASING POWER. THEY CAN- IMPACT THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT NEED THAT ECONOMIC GROWTH BY AWARDING A CONTRACT WORKING WITH THE- GOBIZ OFFICE AND THE OFFICE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS ADVOCATE. WE ARE THRILLED THAT WE ARE DOING MORE AND MORE IN THIS SPACE. THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE SPECIFICALLY TARGET- PERSONS OF COLOR TO GO THROUGH THIS TRAINING. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE UNDERSTANDING THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE NEEDED BY THE STATE AND OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE AGENCIES. TO BE ABLE TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO GROW THEIR DREAMS OF BEING AN ENTREPRENEUR. I I THINK THAT PROGRAM IS SOMETHING THAT IS AVAILABLE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF IN A MUCH LONGER WAY LARGER WAY. THE SECOND PROGRAM I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT WAS THE CAREER PATHWAYS WORK THAT THE LA CHAMBER HAS DONE- MANY OF YOU THAT I WORK WITH THE ALI CHAMBER KNOW THAT FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE A DEEP- EXPERIENCE IN CRADLE TO CAREER INITIATIVE. IN PARTICULAR FOR CAREER PATHWAYS WE WORK WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND L. A. COUNTY. IN ENSURING THAT WE CAN CONNECT STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES TO INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES APPRENTICESHIPS. WITH START UPS OR WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS. THE BENEFIT TO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS IS NOT ONLY OUR STUDENTS PROVIDED THE INSIDE OF VARIOUS CAREER PATHS AND CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. BUT FOR THOSE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS THEY ARE TAPPING INTO A DIVERSE WORK FORCE SOMETHING THAT THEY HIGHLY NEED NOW AND THERE IS A GREATER ATTENTION TO THAT THAT WE SEE TODAY. FOR THIS REASON LAST YEAR THE CHAMBER SUPPORTED PROPOSITION SIXTEEN THE REPEAL OF PROP TWO OH NINE WHICH HAPPENED CHAMPIONED OPPORTUNITIES TO CREATE MORE EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO JOBS TO VARIOUS- PROGRAMS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SOME OF OUR LARGER MEMBERS HAVE ALSO INITIATED PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE JPMORGAN CHASE A MEMBER OF THE CHAMBER OFFERS FELLOWSHIP INTER INITIATIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS LAUNCHED IN TWENTY TEN. THIS FELLOWSHIP HAS PREPARED YOUNG MEN OF COLOR FOR THE FUTURE WORKFORCE THROUGH INCREASED ACCESS AND MENTORSHIP AND PREPAREDNESS AND CAREER READINESS WE ARE SEEING MORE AND MORE OF LARGER ORGANIZATIONS TAKING IT UPON THEMSELVES TO HELP CREATE THE WORK FORCE THAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE FUTURE. THE ESTABLISHMENT AND THE CONTINUATION OF PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE USE THAT I HAVE MENTIONED TO ME ARE THE COLOR CORNERSTONE OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY. ENTREPRENEURSHIP MEANS ECONOMIC MOBILITY. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT MEANS THAT OUR FUTURE TALENT WILL HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AND GROW AND ENSURE THAT THEY'RE WORKING. OUR GOAL IS TO PUT THE LOS ANGELES REGION AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TOWARDS TRUE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE I LOOK FORWARD TO TAKING ANY QUESTIONS FROM THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANNEXURE BRING UP BETWEEN OPINION WAIVER DIRECTOR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY UNION BANK. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THANK YOU CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER FOR INVITING ME TODAY TO JOIN THIS PANEL ON CAREER PATHWAYS AND WEALTH BUILDING FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR. IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO REPRESENT MUFG UNION BANK AND THIS SELECT COMMITTEES CORPORATE ADVISORY BOARD. I AM A MOM OF TWO MAKES THE PAIN OF BOYS MYSELF I THOUGHT I WOULD ADD THAT AS PART OF THE REASON WHY I'M SO PASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE- AGAIN I'M TRYING OF THE END OF A WITH MUFG UNION BANK AND I AM PART OF THE- BANK'S CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TEAM. I HAVE BEEN AT THE BANK FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS AND HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING AT AN INSTITUTION. WHERE CSR IS DEEPLY INGRAINED IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS. IN FACT JUST THIS WEEK THE PUBLICATION THE AMERICAN BANKER. EXCUSE ME- RELEASED A REPORT ON THE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANIES CUSTOMERS MOST ADMIRE AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT UNION BANK WAS RANKED NUMBER FOUR. ACCORDING TO THE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN BANKER UNION BANK RATED HIGH WITH CUSTOMERS NOT JUST FOR ITS SOPHISTICATED PRODUCT OFFERINGS BUT ALSO FOR ITS ETHICAL BUSINESS PRACTICES AND FOR BEING A POSITIVE FORCE IN THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES. THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF I MADE- THREE PRIORITIES CRYSTAL CLEAR FOR US AS THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION FIRST WE NEED TO SUPPORT OUR CLIENTS DURING UNPREDICTABLE ECONOMIC SHIFTS. SECOND WE NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR COMMUNITIES WITH THE RESOURCES TO WEATHER THE FINANCIAL DOWNTURN. AND THIRD ENSURING THAT OUR COLLEAGUES ARE SAFE AND SUPPORTED. WHILE OUR CSR WORK IS GROUNDED IN THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT OR CRA WE BELIEVE IN HAVING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. PARTNERING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND PROVIDING THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS. TO QUOTE JULIUS ROBINSON OUR HEAD OF CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY WE UNDERSTAND HOW INTRINSICALLY RACIAL INEQUITIES ARE INTERTWINED WITH DISPARATE WEALTH DISTRIBUTION IN AMERICA. IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY WE TOOK A SIGNIFICANT STEP. USING REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM WE CREATED A COMMUNITY RECOVERY PROGRAM. A TEN MILLION DOLLAR INITIATIVE TO SUPPORT NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DEDICATED TO SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE WITHIN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED TO RESPOND TO THE SHIFTING NEEDS OF OUR WORLD. WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC INCLUSION IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT'S CLEAR THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE TO RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC. SO OUR GRANTS ARE C. R. P. GRANTS ARE DIRECTED TO ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS THAT FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY REBUILDING THE WORK FORCE AND INCREASING FINANCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE ALSO SUPPORTING ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATION INCLUDING ANTI ASIAN HATE. SO FAR WE HAVE PROVIDED OVER FOUR MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO ECONOMIC INCLUSION WE PROMOTE FINANCIAL EDUCATION THROUGH OUR STUDENT RUN BRANCHES. EACH YEAR TEN TO TWELVE STUDENTS AT FIVE HIGH SCHOOLS. ARE SELECTED FOR A YEAR LONG INTERNSHIP TO WORK IN A BANK BRANCH LOCATED INSIDE THEIR HIGH SCHOOL. A STUDENT BANKERS THEIR- AND PRACTICE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND EDUCATE CLASSMATES TEACHERS AND THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ABOUT THE BASICS OF PERSONAL FINANCE. THE FIVE SCHOOLS ARE MCLEAN HIGH SCHOOL IN FRESNO. CRENSHAW HIGH HIMSELF DELHI. LINCOLN HIGHWAY IN EAST DELHI LARA HIGH SCHOOL IN ANAHEIM AND MOUNTAIN VIEW HIGH IN EL MONTE. OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY STUDENTS HAVE GRADUATED FROM THE PROGRAM A MAJORITY OF WHOM ARE STUDENTS OF COLOR. OF WHICH 95% OF THEM HAVE GONE ON TO COLLEGE. FORTY ONE OF THE GRADUATES HAVE BECOME BANK EMPLOYEES. AND OF THE FORTY ONE FIVE OF US ENDED TO OFFICER POSITIONS. MANY OTHERS HAVE FOUND JOBS AT OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. I'M EXCITED TO SHARE THAT WE WILL SOON BE OPENING OUR STUDENT RUN BRANCH AT LANEY COLLEGE IN OAKLAND. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST STUDENT RUN BRANCH AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE BRANCH IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND WILL BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC WHEN SCHOOL RESUMES IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SORRY. TWO YEARS AGO I JOIN THE CORPORATE ADVISORY BOARD OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE. ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IS KEY TO DEALING WITH RACIAL INEQUITY. THE CAB INCLUDES ABOUT FIFTY CORPORATIONS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES INCLUDING NORTHROP GRUMMAN. COCA COLA AMAZON THE CREATIVE ARTISTS AGENCY- FULL FACTORY. AND MOST OF ALL MOST OF THE PROFESSIONAL SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE INCLUDING THE SACRAMENTO KINGS THE OAKLAND A.'S AND THE LA RAMS. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP MEANINGFUL SOLUTIONS TO INCREASE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE DISCUSSED WHAT ARE COMPANIES ARE ALREADY DOING. TO CREATE A PIPELINE AND CAREER PATHWAYS TO EXAMINE OUR OWN HIRING AND RETENTION PRIORITIES. WHAT DO WE OFFER IN TERMS OF WORK BASED LEARNING IN INTERNSHIPS AND HOW CAN WE PROMOTE PUBLIC PRIVATE AND NONPROFIT PARTNERSHIPS. MANY CORPORATIONS ARE ON THE TABLE ALREADY HAVE INITIATIVE TO TACKLE THESE PRIORITIES AND WE WANT THEM TO SHARE IT WITH THE OTHERS. AS A CAB WE WANT A SPECTRUM OF CAREER OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR WE GUARD LIST OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL LEVEL. WE WANT THEM TO KNOW HOW THEY CAN BE PROMOTED WE WANT THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PAY IF THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING IN A CORPORATION. WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK WITH ONE AND THAT ONE ONE ANOTHER AND PARTNER FOR EXAMPLE. AS A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION HOW CAN WE PARTNER TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO ENCOURAGE HOME OWNERSHIP AND OTHER WEALTH BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES. WE SHOULD WORK WITH NONPROFIT PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO PREPARE YOUNG MAN FOR INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. THE PANDEMIC A SLOW DOWN THE CAP A BIT IN THE LAST YEAR BUT WE ARE READY TO TACKLE THESE ISSUES. SIDE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND I WANNA TURN IT OVER TO THE NEXT SPEAKER JEFFREY WALLACE FROM LEADERS UP THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SILICON VALLEY IN THE FACT THAT- WE'RE TALKING THE CAREER PATHWAYS AND- CREATING GENERATIONAL WEALTH AND I AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS REGARDING APPRENTICESHIPS AND- INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I THINK THAT- I'VE I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT OVER THE HERE'S- AND I MEAN OVER THE DECADES- AND THE DATA CONTINUES TO SHOW. THAT THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK LATINO ENGINEERS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO. EVERY LEVEL OF THE CORPORATE AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE OF THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE PROFITING WILDLY- THEIR NUMBER NUMBERS ON THERE AND THE NUMBERS ARE THERE WAS LIMITED TO IN THE COLOR. SO THERE'S THE TELL ME THERE'S THE SHOW ME AND THE REALITY IS THAT WHAT IS BEING SHOWN IS THAT. THAT THE HIRING IS NOT HAPPENING AND WE HAVE. A BILL WELL INTENTIONED WEATHER'S LEGISLATORS WERE. PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT. EVERY YEAR EVERY COUPLE YEARS COME BECAUSE COMMUNITY MORE MORE PROGRAMS ON THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THE HIRING PRACTICES THAT ARE NOT REFLECTING THE DESIRE FOR THAT CHANGE- AND THAT GOES TO ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE REALITY IS THAT THE AMOUNT THAT CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO HOP TO IT TO HIRE FOLKS. BUT ONE OF THE FEW THINGS WE CAN DO IS HOW TRANSPARENCY. AND TIME AND AGAIN- EFFORTS TO TRY TO GET DATA ON HIRING- IS NOT SUCCESSFUL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT AS NECESSARY TO CREATE REAL CHANGE- I HAVE HAD A BILL THAT. I'M TRYING TO DO THAT THIS PAST YEAR IT WAS NOT SOMETHING WENT THROUGH OF THE NUMBER OF THEM OVER THE YEARS. AND SO YOU KNOW UNLESS- WERE ABLE TO GET REAL DATA ON HIRING PRACTICES ON DISCREPANCIES APPEAR BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ON DISCREPANCIES A PAY- BUT A BIT BETWEEN- YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR- IT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO. MAKE MEANINGFUL CHANGE IN MY OPINION BECAUSE- IS THAT ACCOUNTABILITY IS THAT TRANSPARENCY. LEADS BROTHERS TO SHAMING OR THROUGH THE PATS ON THE BACK. THAT LEADS TO THE POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO. I GOTTA GET OUT HERE BUT I THAT'S NOT MY LAST COMMENT BECAUSE- I THINK- YOU KNOW BUT WE- HEAR A LOT ABOUT. STEM PROGRAMS AND INTERNSHIP AT THE END OF THE DAY THE NUMBERS ARE NOT THERE. AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR. MANY MERRILEES CERTAINLY NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE ENERGY PUT INTO IT SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS I DO APPRECIATE. EVERYTHING THAT OUR PRESENTERS OF. HAVE DEMONSTRATED AS THEIR DESIRE WHAT THEY LIKE. TO SEE- BECAUSE I'M WITH YOU. THANK YOU DID. DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS ARE SURE SURE ANOTHER THE- IN THE STATE GO FROM THERE YES NO I'M HAPPY I'M HAPPY TO- TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS ON ON ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE- YOU'RE RIGHT OUR NUMBERS ARE NOT THERE I WILL SAY. THAT I BELIEVE THAT- SO WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME RIGHT NOW AND I THINK YOU KNOW- THE PANDEMIC WITHOUT A DOUBT YOU KNOW OPENED A LOT OF EYES AROUND THE DISPARITIES- I THINK ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WAS MADE ABOUT LOOKING AT HIRING PRACTICES. THAT'S A BIG DEAL FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO LOOK AT THEIR INTERNAL PROCESSES AND SIT AND QUESTION THEMSELVES HOW ARE WE HIRING WHAT IS THE APPLICATION LOOK LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE IT MORE INCLUSIVE AND MORE OPEN. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS ARE WRESTLING WITH SO- WHILE WELL I. I HEAR YOU ON ON THE FRUSTRATION I ALSO SEE IT WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO DO BETTER. YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO GET THERE- I THINK THAT THERE'S SEVERAL- YOU KNOW- PRIVACY MATTERS AND THINGS OF A THINGS THAT ARE RELATED TO HIM MORE THE HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTION. THAT I THINK THAT- ATTRIBUTES WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NUMBER LESS BY IF I WERE TO SAY YOU KNOW THIS POSITIVE OUTLOOK IS THAT I SEE ORGANIZATIONS WORKING AT THIS HARD. AND LOOKING AT IT IN TERMS OF HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS HOW CAN WE BE MORE OPEN AND MORE INCLUSIVE. AND FOR US AT THE CHAMBER WE'RE GOING TO RUN WITH THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND HELP CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OTHERS SO I THINK- YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT TIME TODAY. AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK FOR US TO REALLY HAVE- YOU KNOW BUSINESSES STEP UP AND HELP THEM HELP THEM. YOU KNOW DEFINE YOU KNOW WHAT IT WHAT NEEDS WHAT PROCESSES NEED TO BE IN PLACE SO THAT THERE'S MORE TRANSPARENCY AND THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITY AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S THE OUTCOMES THAT WILL MATTER THAT'S AWESOME ABOUT YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK WE ARE A DIFFERENT TIME. AND I DON'T DOUBT INTENTIONS BUT I THINK INTENTIONS HAVE TO BE DEALT YES AND THOSE ARE COMES OUT THERE AND I KNOW THAT. THEIR OTHER METRICS INVOLVED I KNOW THAT SURE AND I HAVE BEEN PART OF CONVERSATIONS WHERE THERE'S DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING ALEX USED TO ROOT OUT. THE KIND OF THE BIAS THAT EXISTED AND THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IT. I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK FIVE YEARS AND I DON'T SEE OF THE OUTCOMES MATCH THE INTENSITY OF THE INTENTIONS AND A LAWSUIT MENTIONS ON THE GENERATIONAL WEALTH ONE OF THE GREATEST FROM GENERATIONAL WEALTH. IS PROPERTY ARE THERE ARE STILL A NORMAL. ONE NORMA'S RACISM AND BARRIERS TO PROPERTY OWNERSHIP. AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE'RE SEEING- THE LAW FROM AND- OWNERS IMPROPER THERE NOW BUT A FOREVER. THE DOOR I PRETTY HONOR. HAS BEEN- TO BLOCK FOUND THAT JENNA OF THE BLOCK OUT OF IT AND SOMETHING THAT SAYS ONE OF THING THAT WE HAVE TO BE INTO ABOUT THAT WE WANT TO SEE ABOUT. RESULT. IT DID NOT AND I KNOW IN IN MY DISTRICT- USC HAS A BASE DATE. IT I GIVE A PROGRAM EVERY YEAR ON ON ON STEM PROGRAMS BRING KIDS FROM THE COMMUNITY TO COME IN WANT TO BE ON CAMPUS WE GET USED TO THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT SOME OF NEVER THEY WALKED AROUND USC BUT THEY NEVER WALK THROUGH OR IN USC. EDITOR A BLOCK AWAY AND SO I BRING THEM ON CAMPUS AND THEN I BRING TO THE PATERNITY SCHOOL REGION AREA AND THEY THEY DO ENGINEERING THINGS WITH HIM AND THE FUN PART OF IT IS IT IS AN ALL MATH AND IN SCIENCE IT'S FOUGHT IT SO WE SHOOT OFF ROCKETS RIA DO ALL THE FUN THINGS AND I JUST REMEMBER JUST JUST SITTING WITH THEM. AND SAYING THAT- THERE'S. DID YOU CAN GET A DEGREE. AND GAMING AND I'LL LOOK UP AND GO YOU ME LIKE- GAMES I DIDN'T YES STIRS. EVEN GET UP UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE AND- BUT AT THAT TIME WHEN I FIRST STARTED- NEW YORK UNIVERSITY HAD DIRT AT THE BEST GATE MEANS. AND YOU START OUT MAKING LIKE EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND BECAUSE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHEN YOU GRADUATE AND I SAID DIDN'T AND THEN YOU SEE THESE KIDS GO OKAY SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. I GO TO COLLEGE FOR FOUR YEARS SHOULD. I LEARNED EVERYTHING I NEED TO CREATE A GAME. AND THEN YOU PAY ME FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE TO CREATE GAMES THAT I PLAYED ALL THE TIME BUT I NOW BE CREATED AND MAKE MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IN THE CITY NEXT YEAR THANKS AND I USUALLY SAY. AND N. LESTER TO THE MOTHERS FATHERS. THEN YOU CAN RETIRE. AND THEY DIDN'T TAKE CARE YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE AND YOU COULD SEE THE MOTHERS SELECT A LOCATION HEADER. FRANCE MISSTATEMENTS IN UP. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY OF A LIFETIME AND- AT SCG EVERY SCHOOL 61% OF THE UNDERGRADUATES ARE FEMALE. AND IN ENGINEERING. THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO NOW WE HAVE REMEMBER AVENUE WE GET MORE WOMEN. AN ENGINEERING MUCH LIKE EIGHT EIGHT YOU ONLY GET IT IF I CAN GET MORE BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR IN TWO ENGINEERING. AND MANY OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD AT MATH. BUT BETTY AT THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IDEA IT IT CAN- MIDDLE SCHOOL SO HOW TO GET DISTRACTED IS OUR HORMONES ARE JUST GROWING UP TO GET DISTRACTED. BUT IF WE CAN CREATE THAT THAT AVENUE IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES. A PLUS SAYS INITIATIVE WHERE IF YOU GO. AND BE PART A PROGRAM THROUGH FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL DR PAVE YOUR WAY THROUGH USC SO THERE'S A. LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HOW DO WE CONNECT. HOW DO WE CAN TO A BOY A MINUTE. INTO THAT AB. WHERE IT'S IT WAS LIKE IT'S- AUTOMATIC SUCCESS. PARENTS JUST NEED TO SHOW UP ONCE A MONTH. KIDS NEED TO COME. ON THE WEEKENDS AND YOU GOT YOUR YOUR PARKED CAR SHOW PROGRESS. AND- YOU GET A FOUR YEAR SCHOLARSHIP IF YOU'RE PART OF THAT SO HOT THERE IT BACK TO WHAT WE'RE SAYING THERE ARE AVENUES. BUT WE'RE WE'RE NOT DOING A VERY EFFECTIVE JOB OF CONNECTING THAT AND THEN WHEN THEY GET OUT. IT'S VERY EASY TO CONNECTING TO CHAMBER WHICH WILL GET THEM INTO JOBS THAT WERE KEEPING GOING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. AT AND I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN AGE RANGE THAT MIDDLE SCHOOL AGE RANGE. IS KEY IT THAT INVESTMENT OF ANY KIND THAT CAN BE MADE WITH IN THAT MIDDLE SCHOOL. YEARS I THINK YOU KNOW JUST FOR MY EXPERIENCE IS A MOTHER. THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW THEY REALLY FORM THAT FOUNDATION THAT WILL CARRY THEM THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THAT WILL PREPARE THEM FOR A COLLEGE CAREER LIKE AN INVERTER B. SO- YOU KNOW I'VE FOUGHT THIS COMMITTEE FOR LOOKING AT. THE BOYS BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY NEED TO BE INSPIRED AT THAT TIME FRAME. GOOD EXCUSE ME- BUT THIS WAS WALLACE EPILEPSY COULD NOT. FIELD LEADERS YES IT IS. YOU MAY BEGIN HERE. YEAH I JUST WANTED TO MAKE BRIEF COMMENTS AROUND- I AGREE WITH THIS OUR UP MY FELLOW PANELISTS THE L. UP DE LA CHAMBER THAT ON THIS IMPORTANT TO BUILD THESE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS IN MIDDLE SCHOOL IS QUITE IMPORTANT UPDATE INFLECTION POINT IN ONE'S CAREER WHAT ALSO ARGUED THAT IMPORTANT PARTS PRESENTS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENTS OF THOSE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS ARE. ACTUALLY CIRCLE BACK TO. YOU KNOW THE FOLKS IN ON ACTS TO EMPLOYMENT. ACTUALLY CAREER PATH SALARY ACADEMIC. CAREER AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR CORPORATE AMERICA LEAN AND MORE ARE MOVING IN BEYOND JUST LOOKING AT THESE- STATISTICS OUTCOMES PROPOSITIONAL INDICATED THAT RELATES TO DIVERSITY AND REALLY LOOKING AT POLICIES PRACTICES IN PEOPLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THAT CREATE. AN ANTI RACIST ENVIRONMENT- AND I STAND BEFORE YOU I'M NOT FOR YOU BUT BIRCHLEY- TO PRESENT- A PERSPECTIVE THAT CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP- NEEDS TO ADOPT A ANTI RACISM WHEN I SAY THAT- WE LOOK AT ONE OF THE MOST RACES SYSTEMS IN OUR NATION IS OUR CON. AND THAT IS AT SEVEN FIVE BY THE WEALTH AND INCOME INEQUALITY GAP WHERE AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN ARE MAKING SEVENTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR EVERY WHAT ONE DOLLAR WHITE MAN MAKES ON THE FACT THAT CORPORATE AMERICA WAS A HUNDRED AND 75% OF THE LABOR MARKET. GIVE THEM THE POWER TO SHIFT- THE SYSTEMIC DRIVERS THAT BECAUSE THESE THIS GAP BETWEEN WEALTHY INCOME- EXACERBATE NAMELY IN THE AREAS OF EDUCATION AND ALIGNED WITH THE FUTURE OF WORK WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT I THINK THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO REIMAGINE CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION THROUGH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. pOF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES OR THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS LIKE WITH OUR ORGANIZATION LEADERS UP AND GOOGLE DOT ORG THAT IS SCALING CAREER CERTIFICATES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED BY EMPLOYERS THAT ARE CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS TO WAGES THAT START OF ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WE NEED MORE DEMAND DRIVEN EMPLOYER THEIR CAREER AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION DIGITALLY- AS WELL AS A BRICK AND MORTAR. THE SECOND AREAS IN- EMPLOYMENT AND- PROMOTION OR CAREER PATHWAYS WE NEED TO REIMAGINE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS THAT WORK FOR EMPLOYERS NOT BOGGED DOWN IN BUREAUCRACY IT BEING RECOGNIZED VERY EARLY ORDER BUILT A PARTNERSHIP BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- ONE THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE FUTURE OF WORK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE COMPETENCY AND SKILLS THAT EMPLOYERS NEEDS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SELL PRICE- CENTER FOR SOCIAL INNOVATION YOU KNOW OR- CAL. BUT THEY WOULD BE SIGNED WITH EMPLOYERS FETA YOU. GRANGER UP AND GO. THE NUMBER OF CAREER PATHWAY THAT WE HAVE THE- OUT LAND FOLKS BOB A MINUTE- AVERAGING WAY JUST ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. I'M LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE'RE LOOKING AT COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS AS ANOTHER DRIVER THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY- PULL A STRATEGIC LEVEL TO CLOSE THE GAP. SPECIFICALLY AS WE TALKED ABOUT WAS ME THE COLOR THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE AFTERNOON FROM THE TRAUMA INFORMED BY. PILOTS TO- BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES ALL OF THIS IS CONNECTED TO ECONOMIC STABILITY OR AT. OUTCOME BUTTON I CAN IN. I WILL WE ALL- WE LOOK AT THE SOCIAL SERVICE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED TO YOU THAT WE NEED TO PARTNER WITH. THE CORPORATE ABOUT CORPORATE AMERICA PRIVATE SECTOR TO TRANSFORM THE STATION THAT- PROGRAMS INTO OPPORTUNITY TRAMPOLINE PROGRAMS ONES THAT COUNTS IN CATALYZE WAS A MINUTE COLOR FURTHER INTO THE WEALTH. ACCUMULATED ACROSS THE WEALTH ACCUMULATION SPECTER. THINGS LIKE PROVIDING SUBSIDIES AROUND HOUSING CHILDCARE TRANSPORTATION ARE CORRECT BUT ALSO WHERE ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THE UP WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO RAISE THE THRESHOLD FOR BOYS A MINUTE COLOR RALPH AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY THAT WILL HELP THE BILL WELL. I FIRST TIME HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS SO MANY TIMES WE START WORKING THE START TO LIVE UP START MAKING A DECENT WAGE LOSS AND DECENT WE LOOK AT THE FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR SIXTEEN SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A WEEK. TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A. MONTH GROSS NOT NET. AVERAGE A RARE. A CAL. TWELVE FORTY DOLLARS WILL YOU THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN THE CLIENT IS A LIVING OFF A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. YOU CAN DO THAT SO WE THINK ABOUT THINGS LIKE UNIVERSAL- IT INCOME. AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES LET'S ALSO PUBLIC WELL GET THE PRIVATE SECTOR MORE INVOLVED INTO. UP STRATEGIES WITH THE PUBLIC SECTOR THAT ACTUALLY HELPS RAISE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE AFFORDABILITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE ARE AREAS THAT CORPORATE AMERICA SHOULD LEAN INTO. IF THEY ARE MOVING BEYOND STATEMENTS AROUND RACIAL JUSTICE IN LOOKING AT PROBLEMS OF RACIAL INEQUITY. ACTUALLY ADVANCING AN ANTI RACIST PERSPECTIVE. ARGUABLY ARE COUNTING IS BEEN THERE IT HAS BEEN RACES SINCE IT'S TO SIGN. UP HOWEVER COMMA GIVEN THE INFLUX OF CORPORATE CORPORATIONS. AND- ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR STATE ARE NOW ANSWER JEFF IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO NOW HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IN HELP TO OPERATIONALIZE THE STRATEGIES BEYOND PROGRAMS- THAT INTERVENE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH CORPORATIONS. TO GENERATE THE TOP BOX OPPORTUNITIES NECESSARY. THANK YOU I'M GLAD WE FINALLY GOT YOU AND- I WHERE ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES PAST OUR OUR TIME AT THREE THIRTY- UNLESS THERE ANY FINAL COMMENTS FROM. ANY OF THE MEMBERS THAT ARE LEFT MR LACKEY. JUST REAL BRIEFLY I. I THINK SOME SOME VERY VALID POINTS HAVE BEEN MADE- THROUGH THE REMARKS OF- PANELIST AND SPEAKERS HERE TODAY. I THINK THAT- ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE- FACE AS A SOCIETY IS GETTING AND ONE OF THE GREAT BARRIERS- THAT WE FACE IS GETTING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE ESPECIALLY. BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO BELIEVE IN-THEMSELVES. AND I THINK THE WAY WE DO THAT IS WHICH WAS OUTLINED IN SOME OF THE- OTHER SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMMING IS TO BUILD. MENTORSHIP AND THE SENSE OF FAMILY PEOPLE THEY TRUST. BECAUSE THAT'S WHO THEY RESPOND TO. AND- I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. CIRCUMSTANCES THAT OF- DOES ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRUST THE RIGHT PEOPLE. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S LED TO A VERY- DISCOURAGING CENTER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE- REALIZING NOW AND I THINK THAT WE'RE ALL. TRYING TO PARTNER AND I THINK THAT- AS WE ENCOURAGE OUR YOUNG MEN AND- OUR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR TO- TO EMBRACE OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE TO ALSO YOU KNOW ENHANCE OPPORTUNITIES BUT ONCE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES COME. YOU HAVE TO REACT YOU HAVE TO REACT IN A POSITIVE MANNER AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT AND COURAGE IN. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO- TAKE THESE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THEIR TRUST LEVELS LOWER. AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCOURAGE MOOD THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF THE- NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES AND TO GET. PEOPLE TO REFOCUS THEIR TRUST IT'S DIFFICULT AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS NEEDS TO BE IN ON THE COURAGE BY ALL THE ORGANIZATIONS AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE THE TRUE MEASURE OF SUCCESS OUR OUTCOMES. AND IF WE'RE NOT GETTING OUTCOMES WERE NOT- MOVING WHERE WE NEED TO GO SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL AND- I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU MR LACKEY AND WITH THAT I WILL RETURN TO SELECT COMMITTEE OF BOYS MINUTE COLOR INFORMATIONAL HEARING.
