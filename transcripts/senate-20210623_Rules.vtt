00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.136
HAPPENS PEOPLE DON'T APPRECIATE

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:05.304
PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH IS GOING TO

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:09.008
BE CLEAN AIR SAFE WATER EXCEPT

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:11.977
ECCENTRIC. SO THE PANDEMIC

00:15:12.044 --> 00:15:13.746
REALLY REVEALED HOW IMPORTANT

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:15.114
PUBLIC HEALTH AS PEOPLE

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.615
RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN YOU PREVENT

00:15:16.682 --> 00:15:18.384
TRANSMISSION OF CULTIVATED. YOU

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.185
CAN PREVENT NOT JUST CASES

00:15:20.252 --> 00:15:21.220
HOSPITALIZATIONS AND DEATH BUT

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:22.921
YOU CAN PREVENT THE COLLAPSE OF

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:24.356
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:27.159
WOULD IMPACT SO MANY SO MANY

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:30.529
PEOPLE. FELT UNFORTUNATELY OVER

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:33.732
TO OVER TIME WHEN AFTER SELLS

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:36.602
DISASTERS HAVE HAPPENED THERE

00:15:36.669 --> 00:15:39.271
IS AN INFUSION OF. CATEGORICAL

00:15:39.338 --> 00:15:41.040
DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH THAT ISSUE

00:15:41.106 --> 00:15:43.175
BUT OVER TIME THOSE CATEGORICAL

00:15:43.242 --> 00:15:45.778
DOLLARS GO AWAY AND PUBLIC

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:48.414
HEALTH NEEDS IS ONGOING ONGOING

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.582
FUNDING COULD DEAL WITH THAT

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:52.584
CORE INFRASTRUCTURE OF PUBLIC

00:15:52.651 --> 00:15:54.486
HEALTH THE CATEGORICAL DOLLARS

00:15:54.553 --> 00:15:55.788
OFTENTIMES DON'T GIVE US THE

00:15:55.854 --> 00:15:57.623
FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.991
AND TO DEAL WITH EMERGING

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.659
PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS SO WE

00:16:00.726 --> 00:16:01.827
NEED A CORE FUNCTIONAL

00:16:01.894 --> 00:16:03.962
CAPABILITIES TO BE TO BE FUNDED

00:16:04.029 --> 00:16:05.698
AND A CORE AREA IS GOING TO BE.

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:06.999
FOR EXAMPLE IS JUST AN

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:08.901
EMERGENCY PREPARED EMERGENCY

00:16:08.967 --> 00:16:11.370
PREPAREDNESS- WE NEED TO TAKE A

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:13.439
MORE REGIONAL APPROACH TO WORK

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:15.341
MORE CLOSELY WITH THAT LOCAL

00:16:15.407 --> 00:16:16.208
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND REALLY

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.378
BALANCED THE NEEDS THEY DO WHAT

00:16:19.445 --> 00:16:20.913
THEY DO WHAT THEY DO BEST WHICH

00:16:20.979 --> 00:16:22.281
IS REALLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH

00:16:22.348 --> 00:16:24.249
LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND WE WORK

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:25.584
GOOD AT THE REGIONAL AT THE

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.786
STATE LEVEL USING ECONOMIES OF

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:29.655
SCALE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:31.423
LOCAL HEALTH. COULD BE ABLE TO

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.957
SUPPORT THE LOCAL HEALTH

00:16:32.024 --> 00:16:33.859
DEPARTMENTS THE OTHER MAJOR

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:35.761
AREA WHERE WE NEED- IMPROVEMENT

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:37.096
AND CORE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.864
INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN THE AREA

00:16:38.931 --> 00:16:42.334
OF BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH WE KNOW

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.502
THAT THE PANDEMIC. IS AND WILL

00:16:43.569 --> 00:16:45.137
HAVE A LARGE MENTAL AND

00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:46.338
BEHAVIOR HEALTH IMPACT

00:16:46.405 --> 00:16:47.906
ESPECIALLY ON THE YOUNGEST IN

00:16:47.973 --> 00:16:49.675
CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S A PART

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.143
OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOCUSING ON

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.644
PREVENTION AGAIN WHERE WE

00:16:52.711 --> 00:16:54.546
REALLY NEED TO IMPROVE OUR

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:57.015
CAPABILITIES. AND THE LAST AREA

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:58.217
THAT I WANT TO MENTION IT IS

00:16:58.283 --> 00:17:00.386
GOING TO BE JUST IN OUR AREA OF

00:17:00.452 --> 00:17:02.521
OUR LABORATORY CAPACITY. OUR

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:04.623
SURVEILLANCE UPDATING OUR IT

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.059
SYSTEMS WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO

00:17:07.126 --> 00:17:09.194
BECOME TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.462
IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO BE

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:12.264
ABLE TO. DELIVER PUBLIC HEALTH

00:17:12.331 --> 00:17:14.266
SERVICES FOR FORTY MILLION

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.001
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND SO

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:18.404
THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:20.506
WOULD I WOULD I WOULD FOCUS ON.

00:17:20.572 --> 00:17:22.307
GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT- YOU

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.443
WE ALSO ENDED UP. TALKING ABOUT

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:26.512
SEX AND DRUGS AND I DIDN'T

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:27.112
THINK WE WERE GONNA TALK ABOUT

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:31.316
THAT- IN PREPPING FOR THIS

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:34.219
MEETING BUT- THE WE TALKED

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.687
ABOUT THE INCREASE ACTUALLY IN

00:17:35.754 --> 00:17:37.055
S. T. D.'S AND SEEING AN

00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:38.590
EXPLOSION WITH SOME OF THOSE

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.360
NUMBERS- AS I MENTIONED AT

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:43.529
LEAST WITH HEPATITIS. AB I

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:46.532
BELIEVE IT IS- AT LEAST SEVEN

00:17:46.598 --> 00:17:48.434
HUNDRED FOLKS WERE INFECTED IN

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.468
TWENTY ONE DIED FROM THAT VIRUS

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.537
IN LA YOU SEEN DIEGO AND IN

00:17:51.603 --> 00:17:53.739
SANTA CRUZ AND AS- LUCK WOULD

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.841
HAVE IT- THREE OF THE MEMBERS

00:17:55.908 --> 00:17:58.577
OF RULES. ACTUALLY REPRESENT

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:02.281
THOSE- AREAS SO YOU'VE GOT THAT

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:03.916
AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE THIS

00:18:03.982 --> 00:18:07.119
EXPLOSION. OF STD RATES FOR

00:18:07.186 --> 00:18:08.020
SYPHILIS GONORRHEA AND

00:18:08.086 --> 00:18:10.222
CHLAMYDIA- YOU KNOW WHEN I

00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:11.657
ASKED YOU IF WE WERE READY FOR

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:12.891
THIS I MEAN DO WE HAVE THE

00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.860
INFRASTRUCTURE- AND THE

00:18:14.927 --> 00:18:19.231
CAPACITY- TO DEAL WITH S. AND

00:18:19.298 --> 00:18:21.233
THEN OF COURSE WE MOVED IN TO.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.902
OPIOIDS AND THE IMPACT THAT

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:27.306
THAT IS ALSO HAVING SOMETIMES

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.941
ON THE SAME COMMUNITIES. SO

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:29.875
WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:31.310
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THAT

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:34.446
IS TO JUST ASK YOU PUBLICLY.

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:37.483
HOW WE ARE GOING TO MANAGE THIS

00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:39.852
EXPLOSION AND IF WE ARE READY.

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.453
SO THERE'S CERTAIN THERE'S

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.988
SEVERAL SEVERAL ISSUES THERE

00:18:43.055 --> 00:18:44.356
THE FIRST ONE HAVING TO DO WITH

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:46.291
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES

00:18:46.358 --> 00:18:47.993
SO WE DON'T HAVE BEFORE THE

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:50.028
COVERED PANDEMIC THERE WAS A

00:18:50.095 --> 00:18:51.697
LARGE INCREASE IN SEXUALLY

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:53.065
TRANSMITTED DISEASES.

00:18:53.131 --> 00:18:55.033
ESPECIALLY SYPHILIS GONORRHEA

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:56.869
CHLAMYDIA AND THEN CONGENITAL

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.904
SYPHILIS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.139
WE'VE HAD NOW WITH KHALID. IS

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.908
THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.776
DELIVER THE SUFFICIENT AMOUNT

00:19:04.843 --> 00:19:06.445
OF SCREENING AND TREATMENT OF

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:07.880
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:09.181
AND IN FACT I WAS LOOKING AT

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.650
THE DATA TODAY. AND SOME OF THE

00:19:11.717 --> 00:19:12.951
DATA SHOWS THAT THERE IS A

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:15.053
SLIGHT DECREASE AND I THINK

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.089
THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T. WE

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.023
HAVEN'T HAD SUFFICIENT TESTING

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.526
RIGHT NOW SO AS WE RECOVER FROM

00:19:20.592 --> 00:19:22.294
COLD MAYBE REALLY HAVE TO GET

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:23.662
OUR SCREENING AND OUR TESTING

00:19:23.729 --> 00:19:25.230
INFRASTRUCTURE BOB. YEAH OTHER

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:26.398
IMPORTANT AREA WITH SEXUALLY

00:19:26.465 --> 00:19:28.700
TRANSMITTED DISEASES IS AND

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:30.102
KANSEN VISITATION AND CONTACT

00:19:30.168 --> 00:19:32.738
TRACING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:35.040
LOCALS HAVE LIMITED STAFF TO DO

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.542
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.176
LEARNED WITH CALLS MADE IS THAT

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:41.079
WE CAN REALLY SUPPORT- CASE

00:19:41.146 --> 00:19:41.847
INVESTIGATION AND CONTACT

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:44.816
TRACING OUT A DISTANCE. USING A

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:47.386
MODERN SOFTWARE SO WE NOW HAVE

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:49.021
A VERY SOPHISTICATED DATA BASE

00:19:49.087 --> 00:19:51.356
THAT ALLOWS US TO DO. CONTACT

00:19:51.423 --> 00:19:53.392
TRACING FOR COPD PATIENTS THAT

00:19:53.458 --> 00:19:54.560
SAME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'VE

00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:57.262
NOW INVESTED CAN NOW BE USED TO

00:19:57.329 --> 00:20:02.000
SUPPORT LOCALS. AROUND SEXUALLY

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:02.834
TRANSMITTED DISEASES. SOME OF

00:20:02.901 --> 00:20:04.303
THE SOME THE VERY FOR. ON THE

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:05.871
AREA OF DECEMBER. GONNA READ

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:07.606
AND COULD GENERAL'S. SOME OF

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:09.508
THESE ARE DO SEE THAT GO

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.209
UNTREATED OFTEN TEND TO BE

00:20:11.276 --> 00:20:12.844
ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:15.647
ADDICTED TO DRUGS. WHO WHO WELL

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:18.383
I TRADE A SEX FOR DRUGS OR

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.119
OTHER RESOURCES. AND WHAT

00:20:21.186 --> 00:20:23.221
HAPPENS IS THAT THEY DON'T GET

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.256
THEY DON'T GET DIAGNOSED THEY

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:25.924
DON'T GET TREATED AND THEN YOU

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.526
HAVE CASES OF CONGENITAL

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:27.993
SYPHILIS LAST HAS BEN

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.697
DECREASING. OVER TIME- WHAT WE

00:20:31.763 --> 00:20:32.864
KNOW FROM THE DATA THAT'S BEEN

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.867
PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH-

00:20:35.934 --> 00:20:37.803
WOMEN WHO USE METHAMPHETAMINE.

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:40.372
BOB SO THE OPIOID OVER THE

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.474
OPIOID EPIDEMIC IS IT IS AN

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:43.742
ISSUE THAT IT'S A SORT OF A

00:20:43.809 --> 00:20:45.077
SEPARATE TOPIC WHICH IS

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.645
CONNECTED. WITH ANOTHER ISSUE

00:20:46.712 --> 00:20:48.413
THAT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:49.615
YEARS HAS INCREASED

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:51.850
DRAMATICALLY AND RIGHT NOW

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:53.051
WITHOUT A FENTANYL AND

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.519
METHAMPHETAMINE AND POLY

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.089
SUBSTANCE USE. IT'S BEEN A- A

00:20:57.155 --> 00:21:00.659
BIG ISSUE. AND I'M I'M HAPPY

00:21:00.726 --> 00:21:01.693
TO. GOING TO MORE DETAIL BUT I

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.294
DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:06.365
TIME. NO NO IT SOME THANK YOU

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.067
FOR THAT AND- IT'S IT WAS

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:10.202
STARTLING FOR ME TO ACTUALLY

00:21:10.268 --> 00:21:13.071
HEAR THAT WHEN YOU WHEN I TALK

00:21:13.138 --> 00:21:13.839
TO BECAUSE I THINK IT REALLY

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.340
PUTS INTO PERSPECTIVE HOW

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:16.975
IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE A

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:17.809
SOLID. PUBLIC HEALTH

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:21.179
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S REACHING-

00:21:21.246 --> 00:21:23.148
THROUGHOUT EVERY DISTRICT AND

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:25.417
COMMUNITY- THROUGHOUT THE STATE

00:21:25.484 --> 00:21:26.518
OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE SURE

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.020
FOLKS HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. I

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:29.421
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE UP

00:21:29.488 --> 00:21:31.490
MUCH MORE TIME. FROM MY OTHER

00:21:31.556 --> 00:21:32.858
COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE QUESTIONS

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.159
BUT I DO KNOW THAT DEPARTMENT

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:36.094
OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IS

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:39.464
RESPONSIBLE FOR- A REGULATING

00:21:39.531 --> 00:21:41.400
MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED SNAPS

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.802
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

00:21:43.869 --> 00:21:46.538
WE ALSO FOCUS ON OUR- ELDERLY

00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:49.274
POPULATION- THERE HAVE BEEN

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:50.542
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IF WE WILL

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:52.678
HAVE A SNIFF SHORTAGE. THERE

00:21:52.744 --> 00:21:54.079
ARE CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:55.714
ABOUT THE KIND OF TREATMENT

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.115
THAT OUR ELDERS ARE GETTING IN

00:21:57.182 --> 00:22:00.552
THESE FACILITIES- AND SO WELL

POSITION. I DO HAVE- I'D LIKE

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.641
TO FOLLOW UP VERY QUICKLY ON

00:24:02.707 --> 00:24:03.809
SOMETHING BROUGHT UP ON THE

00:24:03.875 --> 00:24:05.310
OPIOID THING I'VE BEEN WORKING

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:08.313
ON THAT IT SINCE- I. ACTUALLY

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.714
WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY WITH

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:12.350
A DRUG CALLED ECSTASY I HAD TO

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.586
PAY A BILL ON THAT I DIDN'T GET

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.221
TOO FAR BECAUSE THERE IS SOME

00:24:16.288 --> 00:24:18.023
CONCERN ABOUT CRIMINALIZING

00:24:18.089 --> 00:24:21.026
DRUGS TOO OFTEN- SO I'D LIKE TO

00:24:21.092 --> 00:24:22.260
HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE

00:24:22.327 --> 00:24:24.196
DECRIMINALIZATION OF DRUGS

00:24:24.262 --> 00:24:25.831
THERE IS A POSITIVE SIDE TO

00:24:25.897 --> 00:24:27.232
THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.100
THERE'S ANOTHER SIDE TO IT.

00:24:29.167 --> 00:24:31.536
THAT OPENS UP A WHOLE WHAT I

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:33.471
CONSIDER TO BE A PANDORA'S BOX

00:24:33.538 --> 00:24:35.373
OF IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.976
ENCOURAGING DRUG USE IN THE

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:40.045
PARTY SCENE AND THAT'S WHERE

00:24:40.111 --> 00:24:42.047
WE'VE SEEN I THINK A LOT OF THE

00:24:42.113 --> 00:24:44.316
UNFORTUNATE CONSEQUENCES OF FAN

00:24:44.382 --> 00:24:45.617
MAIL GETTING LACED INTO

00:24:45.684 --> 00:24:48.653
OPIOIDS- I KNOW I WAS A SOCIAL

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:51.756
WORKER DURING THE CON DR LEARY.

00:24:51.823 --> 00:24:54.159
IN GENERATION AND I INTERVIEWED

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:55.961
MANY YOUNG PEOPLE AT THAT TIME

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:58.630
WHO WERE- INTO LSD AND

00:24:58.697 --> 00:25:00.999
UNFORTUNATELY HAD A LOT OF

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:02.834
BRAIN DAMAGE BECAUSE OF THAT SO

00:25:02.901 --> 00:25:04.035
I HAVE KIND OF MIXED EMOTIONS

00:25:04.102 --> 00:25:06.004
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING AND WANT

00:25:06.071 --> 00:25:08.240
TO BE. ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:09.608
DECRIMINALIZATION ACROSS THEIR

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:14.880
RESEARCH. EVERY SPECTER OF

00:25:14.946 --> 00:25:17.015
THEIR FEAR OF CONCERN TO ME-

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:18.250
ABOUT YOU FOR MUCH THANK YOU

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.017
VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTIONS IS

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:21.920
A IMPORTANT QUESTION AND ALSO

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:23.388
TO ADDRESS SEVERAL DIFFERENT

00:25:23.455 --> 00:25:25.757
ISSUES ONE ISSUE IS- FIRST OF

00:25:25.824 --> 00:25:27.659
ALL I WANT TO START OFF WITH

00:25:27.726 --> 00:25:29.361
FIRST JUST TALKING ABOUT USE

00:25:29.427 --> 00:25:32.097
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.499
TO PROTECT YOU IF. THE DEBT

00:25:34.566 --> 00:25:36.401
DEVELOPING MIND OF USE IN

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:38.670
ADOLESCENCE WHEN IT GETS

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.171
EXPOSED TO REALLY ANYTHING

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.140
ANYTIME ANY TYPE OF DRUG THAT

00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:43.742
CAN ALTER THE NEURAL CHEMISTRY

00:25:43.808 --> 00:25:45.911
REALLY PROCESS O THE POTENTIAL

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:46.745
FOR USED TO BE ADDICTED TO

00:25:46.811 --> 00:25:48.813
SUBSTANCES TO PROTECT OUR YOUTH

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.448
IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHETHER

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:53.051
SOMETHING IS DECRIMINALIZED

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:54.219
LEGAL ILLEGAL IT DOESN'T

00:25:54.286 --> 00:25:56.221
MATTER- SO FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:57.856
WANT KIDS SMOKING WE DON'T WANT

00:25:57.923 --> 00:25:59.324
WE DON'T WANT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.692
ARE CONSUMING CONSUMING

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:03.295
CANNABIS THE SECOND ISSUE YOU

00:26:03.361 --> 00:26:05.563
BROUGHT UP WITH THE ISSUE OF

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:08.867
YOU MENTIONED FENTANYL FENTANYL

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:10.802
HAS REALLY TRANSFORMED WHAT'S

00:26:10.869 --> 00:26:11.736
HAPPENED AROUND OPIOID

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:14.072
ADDICTION- I WAS MENTIONING

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:16.241
EARLIER THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:17.742
NOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING

00:26:17.809 --> 00:26:19.244
AS FOUR WAVES OF THE OPIOID

00:26:19.311 --> 00:26:20.645
EPIDEMIC WITH THE FIRST WAS A

00:26:20.712 --> 00:26:22.113
PRESCRIPTION OF CHILD ARE

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.149
PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. AND WE

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:26.151
HAD HERE WHEN THEN WE HAVE

00:26:26.217 --> 00:26:27.252
FOUND SMALL AND NOW WE'RE IN

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:29.087
THIS NEW PHASE WHERE WE HAVE

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:31.356
FENTANYL AND POLY SUBSTANCE USE

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:33.558
AND MAXINE AND ADULTERATION IT

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:34.893
IS BECAUSE IT'S BECOME SO

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.428
DANGEROUS AT ANY STREET DRAW

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:38.596
CAN BE CAN BE ADULTERATED WITH

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:39.464
FAT AND ALSO IT'S BECOMING

00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:41.099
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS FOR

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.767
ANYBODY TO BE. TO BE EXACT-

00:26:42.834 --> 00:26:44.536
EXPERIMENTING WITH ANY TYPE OF

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:45.937
DRUG USE BECAUSE BECAUSE

00:26:46.004 --> 00:26:47.172
PHANTOM OF THE OTHER BIG

00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.540
CHALLENGING HALF WITH FENTANYL

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.775
IS THAT IT'S SYNTHETIC AND

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:52.210
THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED

00:26:52.277 --> 00:26:53.945
ANALOG IT'S INCREDIBLY CHEAP

00:26:54.012 --> 00:26:55.580
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE AND VERY

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:58.149
DEADLY AND SO ON IT'S ALL AYE

00:26:58.216 --> 00:26:59.818
AYE AYE DESCRIBED IT'S ALMOST

00:26:59.884 --> 00:27:08.093
LIKE THE VARIANCE WITH KOBE.

00:27:08.159 --> 00:27:08.693
NINETEEN IT'S FIGURED OUT HOW

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.327
TO REALLY. PENETRATE ARE

00:27:09.394 --> 00:27:10.128
POPULAR AND I THINK THE LONG

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:10.895
TERM. YES REALLY GOING BACK AND

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:12.530
REALLY FOR. ON YOUTH WE REALLY

00:27:12.597 --> 00:27:13.798
HAVE TO AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

00:27:13.865 --> 00:27:15.533
DECREASE DEMAND. AND THEN YOU

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.901
MEANT MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.903
DECRIMINALIZATION I THOUGHT

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.206
ABOUT THAT A THREE. THREE WAYS

00:27:21.272 --> 00:27:22.941
ONE IS. ONE IS OF COURSE

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.342
DECRIMINALIZATION WHERE YOU

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:25.343
DON'T PUT PEOPLE IN PRISON

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.145
BECAUSE THEY ARE EXPERIMENTING

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:28.847
TO USE IN A TRIBE. THE OTHER

00:27:28.913 --> 00:27:31.950
CATEGORIES LEGAL LEGALIZATION-

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:33.284
WE SAW CANNABIS WAS WE SAW

00:27:33.351 --> 00:27:35.120
CANNABIS THAT WAS LEGALIZED SO

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:36.454
THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE YOU CAN

00:27:36.521 --> 00:27:38.556
PRODUCE EIGHT EIGHT. TRUCK

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:42.727
THAT'S CAN BE CONSUMED MOSTLY

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:45.463
SAFETY BY ADULTS. BEYOND BEYOND

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:47.232
LEGALIZATION IS WHAT A PUBLIC

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:47.966
HEALTH WE CALL

00:27:48.033 --> 00:27:50.068
COMMERCIALIZATION WHICH IS NOT

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.804
PROMOTING OF A DRIVE BASICALLY

00:27:52.871 --> 00:27:54.639
FOR CONSUMPTION AND PROFITS.

00:27:54.706 --> 00:27:56.608
AND IN PUBLIC HEALTH WE REALLY

00:27:56.674 --> 00:27:58.543
TRY TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS GOING

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:00.645
TO WHAT IS GOING TO. REALLY I

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:03.181
HAVE CREATE THE LEAST HARM IS

00:28:03.248 --> 00:28:04.049
GOING TO BE THE MOST HEALTH

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:06.317
PROTECTIVE. SO AND THAT'S

00:28:06.384 --> 00:28:07.318
REALLY THE WAY THAT WE THINK

00:28:07.385 --> 00:28:08.520
WITH THE WITH THE WAY THAT WE

00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:10.355
THINK ABOUT IT REPRIEVE PUBLIC

00:28:10.422 --> 00:28:11.723
HEALTH FOLKS IN GENERAL WILL

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:13.491
STICK WITH OUR SMALL SUPPORT

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:15.360
DECRIMINALIZATION. AND

00:28:15.427 --> 00:28:17.195
LEGALIZATION WE BECOME

00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.229
CONCERNED WITH SOMETHING

00:28:18.296 --> 00:28:19.431
BECAUSE IT'S FOCUSED ON

00:28:19.497 --> 00:28:20.932
COMMERCIALIZATION AND IS

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:22.467
PROMOTING A PRODUCT THAT HAS

00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:23.935
BEEN ADDICTIVE POTENTIAL

00:28:24.002 --> 00:28:25.737
ESPECIALLY WITH MAJOR TRACTIVE

00:28:25.804 --> 00:28:27.872
TO USE- AND SO THAT'S WHERE WE

00:28:27.939 --> 00:28:29.541
GET WE GET VERY COMES WE GET

00:28:29.607 --> 00:28:31.376
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT I THINK

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:31.943
THAT'S PART OF WHAT YOU'RE

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:33.344
DESCRIBING IN TERMS OF-

00:28:33.411 --> 00:28:36.281
UNFORTUNATELY- PROMOTING. DRUG

00:28:36.347 --> 00:28:39.918
USE. THAT EXPOSES PEOPLE TO

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:41.186
THAT RISK. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:43.188
LAW PHONE THOSE RESPONSES MAKE

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:44.589
IT DOES GIVE ME HOPE THAT WE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.458
ARE LOOKING AT ANY IN A MULTI.

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:48.626
FACETED WAY BECAUSE THERE'S

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:49.894
THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:51.396
UNDERLIE IT AND I THINK WHEN WE

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:52.864
WERE WHEN WE STARTED TO

00:28:52.931 --> 00:28:54.799
ADVERTISE DRUGS FONG. THROUGH

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:57.502
THE MEDIA ON TV I MEAN- THERE'S

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:58.870
A DRUG FOR EVERY SINGLE LITTLE

00:28:58.937 --> 00:29:00.071
THING YOU HAVE THAT EVERYONE OF

00:29:00.138 --> 00:29:02.006
THOSE. HAS SOME HORRIBLE-

00:29:02.073 --> 00:29:03.608
CONSEQUENCES AND IF WE START

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:04.843
PROMOTING BUT WHAT THE

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.578
CONSEQUENCES ARE MAYBE WE'RE

00:29:06.644 --> 00:29:07.545
GOING TO SAY WEL I DON'T NEED

00:29:07.612 --> 00:29:09.013
THAT YOU KNOW I'LL JUST TAKE AN

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.348
ASPIRIN TONIGHT OR WHATEVER.

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.050
BUT ANYWAY- ARE JUMPING TO

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:14.085
ANOTHER SUBJECT- REGARDING THE

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:16.187
MONITORING OF THE VARIANTS THAT

00:29:16.254 --> 00:29:18.223
WE ARE NOW STARTING TO SEE POP

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:22.660
UP- HOW IS THE DEPARTMENT-

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:24.729
TAKING MONITORING THOSE IN OUR

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:26.397
COMMUNITY AND IT WHERE THERE

00:29:26.464 --> 00:29:29.267
ARE VACCINES ARE. YOU KNOW

00:29:29.334 --> 00:29:31.202
EFFECTIVE AGAINST THEM AND

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:32.370
WHETHER OR NOT WE WILL NEED

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:33.938
BOOSTER SHOTS IF WE HAVE BEEN

00:29:34.005 --> 00:29:35.740
VACCINATED OF. THESE THINGS

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:39.144
MAYBE. GAIN TRACTION OR GAIN

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:43.047
STRENGTH. I. THAT GOOD COURSE

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:44.149
OF RIGHT NOW FORTUNATELY THE

00:29:44.215 --> 00:29:45.383
BACK THAT HAVE BEEN APPROVED IN

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.518
THE IN THE UNITED STATES ARE

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:49.120
VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST ITALIANS

00:29:49.187 --> 00:29:51.656
IT IS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.291
TO COMPLETE THEIR SERIES. AREAS

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:54.626
THAT WERE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT

00:29:54.692 --> 00:29:56.027
RIGHT NOW IS CALLED THE DELTA

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:58.630
VARIANTS. THAT WAS ORIGINALLY-

00:29:58.696 --> 00:30:01.199
IDENTIFIED IN ENGLAND RIGHT NOW

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:04.569
IT'S ABOUT 6% AND ERA IN THE

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:05.270
I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS IT'S

00:30:05.336 --> 00:30:07.805
ABOUT. 10% IN THE UNITED STATES

00:30:07.872 --> 00:30:09.908
IN ABOUT 6% OF THE ICE LOOKS

00:30:09.974 --> 00:30:12.210
RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. AND

00:30:12.277 --> 00:30:14.812
THE DELTA VARIANT IS INCREDIBLY

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:17.182
INFECTIOUS MUCH MORE INFECTIOUS

00:30:17.248 --> 00:30:19.017
STANDARDIZED IT- VERY AND THAT

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:20.585
WAS KINDA CAME OUT OF THE THAT

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:21.653
THE YOU CAN WHICH IS CALLED

00:30:21.719 --> 00:30:23.388
THAT. THE ALPHA VARIANT WHICH

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.056
HAD TAKEN OVER PARTS OF THE

00:30:25.123 --> 00:30:26.691
UNITED STATES BUT NOW WE SEE

00:30:26.758 --> 00:30:28.660
THE DELTA VERY INCREASING AND

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.794
THERE'S SOME CONCERN THAT

00:30:29.861 --> 00:30:31.462
ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE SICKER. SO

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.631
YES WE ARE VERY GOOD WE'RE VERY

00:30:33.698 --> 00:30:35.567
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT- THE DELTA

00:30:35.633 --> 00:30:38.102
VARIANCE AGAIN FORTUNATELY THE

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:39.971
VACCINES ARE VERY EFFECTIVE.

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:41.372
WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN

00:30:41.439 --> 00:30:44.075
CALIFORNIA- WE'RE NOW I'M MORE

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.977
THAN 70% OF THE POPULATION HAS

00:30:46.044 --> 00:30:46.911
RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE DOES

00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:48.947
WORK. WE'RE IN MUCH BETTER

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:51.115
SHAPE THAN MOST OTHER STATES

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.350
HOWEVER THERE ARE POCKETS OF

00:30:52.417 --> 00:30:54.219
CALIFORNIA BUT WE STILL WANT IT

00:30:54.285 --> 00:30:58.990
WE SAW A LOT MORE. PEOPLE TO

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.658
GET OUT. I VACCINATED. YEAH

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:01.559
THERE IS BROUGHT UP WAS THE

00:31:01.626 --> 00:31:04.062
ISSUE. IT'S TOO SOON TO TELL

00:31:04.128 --> 00:31:06.764
WE'RE GONNA REQUIRE BOOSTERS.

00:31:06.831 --> 00:31:08.933
SOURCE CODE OF THE VIRUS. DOES

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.836
NOT MUTATE AS FREQUENTLY AS THE

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:14.639
INFLUENZA A VIRUS- AND IT'S

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:17.242
POSSIBLE THAT THIS THE VACCINE

00:31:17.308 --> 00:31:18.610
WILL ACTUALLY GIVE US LONGER

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.378
LASTING PROTECTION WE DON'T

00:31:20.445 --> 00:31:22.213
KNOW YET. WE'RE NOT GOING TO

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:24.716
HAVE TO FOLLOW UP AND- TEST

00:31:24.782 --> 00:31:25.550
PEOPLE TO SEE HOW LONG IMMUNITY

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:27.552
IS LASTING. BUT IF WE DO NEED A

00:31:27.619 --> 00:31:29.320
BOOSTER IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.688
LIKE INFLUENZA WE HAVE AN

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:32.557
ANNUAL BOOSTER TO PROBABLY BE A

00:31:32.624 --> 00:31:34.492
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. BUT

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.060
IT'LL TAKE IT'LL TAKE SOME TIME

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:37.829
TO REALLY SORT THAT OUT. THANK

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.230
YOU WOULD THAT MEAN THAT WHEN

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:40.732
YOU GET YOUR ANNUAL PHYSICAL

00:31:40.798 --> 00:31:42.333
AND YOU GET A BLOOD TEST THIRDS

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.368
DETERMINING WHETHER YOU DO

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:46.771
HAVE. ANTIBODIES IN THEIR- IF

00:31:46.838 --> 00:31:47.305
YOU'VE BEEN VACCINATED IS

00:31:47.372 --> 00:31:49.040
ABOUT. YEAH SO YOU KNOW

00:31:49.107 --> 00:31:52.443
HISTORICALLY. PEOPLE HAVE

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:57.749
LOOKED AT THE- ALL. BUT DOCTOR

00:31:57.815 --> 00:32:00.051
YOU MIGHT IF YOU CAN HEAR ME

00:32:00.118 --> 00:32:01.953
YOU MIGHT STOP FOR A MINUTE.

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:04.789
ALSO AND THEN WE HAVE HE SELLS

00:32:04.856 --> 00:32:06.591
BETTER THAN T. CELLS THAT- THAT

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.793
PROVIDE WAS CALLED- CELLULAR

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.728
IMMUNITY AND IS ACTUALLY LONG

00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:13.064
LASTING AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:15.099
IN PREVENTING SEVERE DISEASE-

00:32:15.166 --> 00:32:16.401
SO THAT'S REALLY THE IT'S

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:17.802
REALLY THE COMBINATION OF BOTH

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.238
CLOSE TO SO- ANTIBODIES WANE

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:23.074
OVER TIME TO GO DOWN. BUT THE

00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:24.509
MODERN TECHNOLOGY CAN THAT

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:25.710
HAPPEN THAT CAN NOW LOOK AT T.

00:32:25.777 --> 00:32:26.911
CELLS I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:28.479
RESEARCHERS WILL BE LOKING AT

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:29.914
WILL BE LOOKING TO SEE WHETHER

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:31.716
WE HAVE. BOTH THE BODY AND

00:32:31.783 --> 00:32:32.950
CELLULAR IMMUNITY ABOUT

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:34.952
SLAMBALL THAT LONG LASTING AND

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:37.088
IF THAT IS. AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:32:37.155 --> 00:32:39.557
FANTASTIC NOW AFTER FLUID WELL

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.692

HEART OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:46.124
BEFORE THE DRUG COCKTAIL WHERE.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.458
SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL WAS

00:33:47.525 --> 00:33:49.761
GROUND ZERO. AND THEN YOU GET

APPOINTED. YOU'RE YOU'RE IN THE

00:33:52.597 --> 00:33:54.031
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.900
POSITION WHEN THE PANDEMIC

00:33:55.967 --> 00:33:58.269
BREAKS OUT. THEN YOU'RE POINTED

00:33:58.336 --> 00:33:59.871
TO THE STATE POSITION IN THE

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:01.706
MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC AT THE

00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:04.375
TIME OF SURGE. AND THEN YOU

00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:06.310
LIST AS ONE OF YOUR PRIORITIES

00:34:06.377 --> 00:34:09.147
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SO WHAT

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.082
DID YOU LEARN FROM THESE

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:14.051
DIFFERENT TOP- DRAMATIC

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:15.119
EXPERIENCES IN YOUR WORK

00:34:15.186 --> 00:34:17.321
CAREER. THAT WOULD INFORM WHAT

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:19.056
DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:21.259
US A STATE OF EMERGENCY. UPPER

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:24.429
PEREGRINUS AGAINST ANY FUTURE

00:34:24.495 --> 00:34:28.166
SUCH SITUATIONS- REALLY REALLY

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:29.734
GOOD QUESTION YEAH I THINK I

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.002
EVEN MENTIONED THAT I ALSO DID

00:34:31.068 --> 00:34:33.171
I RAN A CDC TRAINING CENTER

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:34.772
RESEARCH CENTER AT UC BERKELEY

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:35.706
SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:34:35.773 --> 00:34:37.241
FOCUSING ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE

00:34:37.308 --> 00:34:39.343
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS I SPENT

00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.013
ALMOST A YEAR IS JUST PREPARING

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:44.081
FOR THE PANDEMIC THAT. I THINK

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.183
YOU KNOW THAT NEVER THAT NEVER

00:34:45.249 --> 00:34:46.918
CAME OF COURSE WE HAD EACH ONE

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:50.888
AND ONE- AND SO. WHAT AND SO

00:34:50.955 --> 00:34:52.123
YOU KNOW I SPENT MANY YEARS

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:53.458
THINKING ABOUT THINKING ABOUT

00:34:53.524 --> 00:34:54.826
HOW WE WOULD RESPOND TO

00:34:54.892 --> 00:34:56.093
PANDEMIC AND IN FACT WE'VE

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.962
PULLED OUT ALL THOSE ARTICLES

00:34:58.029 --> 00:34:59.964
IN THE CDC GUIDELINES. AND THE

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:02.200
FLAG ME TH CURVE AND SOCIAL

00:35:02.266 --> 00:35:05.102
DISTANCING ALL THOSE THE TOOL

00:35:05.169 --> 00:35:06.771
KIT WITH. WAS DEVELOPED BUT

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:08.573
HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN. IN A

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.942
REAL CONCRETE WAY A LITTLE BIT

00:35:11.008 --> 00:35:12.210
OF IT WAS IMPLEMENTED WITH SARS

00:35:12.276 --> 00:35:14.078
WANTED EARLY EARLY TWO THOUSAND

00:35:14.145 --> 00:35:17.148
AND TWO THOUSAND AND THREE- AND

00:35:17.215 --> 00:35:19.450
SO. I WOULD SAY THAT WE JUST

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:21.953
LEARNED. ALL THE OPERATIONAL

00:35:22.019 --> 00:35:24.755
DETAILS OF WHAT IT TAKES TO

00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:27.859
ACTUALLY. ON TO COMBAT THE

00:35:27.925 --> 00:35:30.194
PANDEMIC OF THIS SEVERITY. WE

00:35:30.261 --> 00:35:31.662
JUST LEARNED A TREMENDOUS

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.197
AMOUNT IN TERMS OF THAT

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:35.900
TESTING- THE IMPORTANCE TO DO

00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:37.401
REALLY GOOD SERVICE GOOD

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:39.237
SURVEILLANCE EARLY DETECTION.

00:35:39.303 --> 00:35:40.438
REALLY TRYING TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.806
THE DRIVERS OF THE INFECTION

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:44.742
ARE YOU CAN YOU CAN SEE THAT

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.010
FROM. THE BEGINNING FROM THE

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:48.079
BEGINNING HOW HOW LITTLE WE

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.248
KNEW ABOUT THE VIRUS WE ASSUME

00:35:50.314 --> 00:35:51.415
THAT IT JUST SPREAD TO LARGE

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:52.717
DROPLETS WHEN IT WAS REALLY

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.352
SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR SOULS AND

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:55.720
WAS AIRBORNE AND CAN TRAVEL

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:57.955
DISTANCES. WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:59.190
WOULD ONLY HAVE SYMPTOMS WITH

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:00.858
ARMED FACTIONS WHEN WE COME TO

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:01.592
LEARN THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:03.227
PEOPLE ARE ARE A SIMPLE A

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:06.397
SYMPTOMATIC- IN SO ALL OF THESE

00:36:06.464 --> 00:36:09.200
THINGS WORK- IT WORKED. REALLY

00:36:09.267 --> 00:36:10.968
HOMEBUILDING HUMBLED EVERYBODY

00:36:11.035 --> 00:36:12.837
AYE AYE I TELL PEOPLE ALL OF US

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:13.804
WERE WRONG AT SOME POINT ABOUT

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:18.376
COVERAGE. AND SO DID DID FOR US

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.443
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY. RESPOND

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:23.381
LEARN. PIVOT AND ADAPT. AND

00:36:23.447 --> 00:36:24.415
EVENTUALLY BE SUCCESSFUL I

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:25.449
DON'T THINK THEY'RE REALLY

00:36:25.516 --> 00:36:27.485

YOU'RE LOOKING. YEAR AFTER YEAR

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:35.293
WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE AND

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:37.194
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE. A

00:36:37.261 --> 00:36:40.264
VACCINE AS SOON AS WE DID. IT

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.866
IS HISTORIC AND SO WE'RE

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:43.568
INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:47.138
VACCINE. BOB RENO RIGHT NOW

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:47.672

MONTHS. AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:51.208
THE VACCINE THIS WEEK. WE WOULD

00:36:51.275 --> 00:36:52.777
NOT JUNE FIFTEENTH WHEN OUT OF

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:55.880
ANOTHER CERTAIN WE WOULD BE

00:36:55.947 --> 00:36:57.715
HAVING A SERVICE TO THE VACCINE

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:59.550
HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:00.551
YEAH I THINK THAT'S BEEN REALLY

00:37:00.618 --> 00:37:02.320
USEFUL TO US IS LEARNING HOW TO

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.321
WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE

00:37:03.387 --> 00:37:05.323
LOCALS. AND REALLY FIGURING OUT

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:07.058
THAT THE RIGHT BALANCE SO AT

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.326
THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE

00:37:08.392 --> 00:37:09.860

PROJECTED WAS GOING TO HAPPEN

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:27.578
SO FOR EXAMPLE WE LIFTED. WHEN

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:28.980

WE ACTUALLY DID THAT THROUGH

00:37:34.318 --> 00:37:35.753
PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WE WERE

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.655
ABLE TO OPEN UP TO. FOR WEEKS

00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:40.257
EARLIER INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:41.626
THINGS TO GO DOWN WE WERE ABLE

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.361

MIGHT HAVE MADE A DECISION

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.701
DIFFERENTLY. OR INCLUDE THE

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:24.902
THINGS YOU JUST SAID WHICH SOME

WE'RE WE'RE EVEN AYE YOU WOULD

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.786
WORRY VALUE WAITING HOW WE

MANAGE THE INCIDENT EARLY ON.

00:38:43.621 --> 00:38:44.722
BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:46.424

TREMENDOUS AMOUNT A TREMENDOUS

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:51.662
AMOUNT TO LEARN- AND IT WASN'T

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.364
IT WASN'T JUST THE FINANCE NOT

00:38:53.431 --> 00:38:53.998
JUST A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:56.267
INTERVENTIONS. NOT JUST WORKING

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:58.569
WITH LOCALS. BUT PUBLIC HEALTH

00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.004
INTERVENTIONS ARE ALWAYS VERY

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:02.907
DIFFICULT BECAUSE- WE WANT TO

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.175
DO THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:05.943
ACTIVITY THAT GETS THE GETS THE

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:08.279
JOB DONE. AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:10.414
SOME IN THE MATTER. WHENEVER

00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:11.182

ALWAYS GOING TO GET UPSET AND

00:39:14.985 --> 00:39:17.655
SO. IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.056
BECAUSE IT'S VERY CHALLENGING

00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:20.124
BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE

00:39:20.191 --> 00:39:21.392
HARM NOT JUST BY THE VIRUS BUT

00:39:21.459 --> 00:39:23.327
THE SHUTDOWN. HAD HAD HAD A

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:25.262
REAL IMPACT. ON THE ECONOMY AND

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:27.631
PEOPLE AND SO- ALWAYS HAVE TO

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.700
BE VERY SENSITIVE AND BE

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.602
COMPASSIONATE AND UNDERSTAND.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:32.937
THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:35.272
INTERVENTIONS- CAN BE DIFFICULT

00:39:35.339 --> 00:39:36.407
CAN BE DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH WE

00:39:36.474 --> 00:39:37.942
BELIEVE IF IT WAS THE RIGHT

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.977
THING. RIGHT THING TO DO. AND

00:39:40.044 --> 00:39:41.912
THE ONE LAST QUESTION I KNOW

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:43.848

00:44:58.128 --> 00:45:01.165
TO SEE- E. WAYS SPECIFICALLY.

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.666
AN INDIVIDUAL MUST BE INFORMED

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.201

COURT THAT I KNOW OF HAS-

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.419
INTERPRETED THIS PROVISION.

00:45:22.486 --> 00:45:23.887
BECAUSE THIS PROVISION HAS NOT

00:45:23.954 --> 00:45:25.422
BEEN A LONG THERE'S NOT BEEN

00:45:25.489 --> 00:45:26.623
CASE LAW ESTABLISH AN

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.158
ESTABLISHED. RIGHT AFTER NINE

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.860
ELEVEN. I MEAN THERE HASN'T

00:45:29.927 --> 00:45:32.096
BEEN A- A CASE LAW THAT I'M

00:45:32.162 --> 00:45:35.332
AWARE OF IF YOU ARE I'D LIKE TO

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:35.899
HEAR YOUR- INTERPRETATION OF

00:45:35.966 --> 00:45:37.935
THAT- OF THE AND THAT. YOU KNOW

00:45:38.001 --> 00:45:40.104
THE CASE LAW BUT- THAT

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.738
SPECIFICALLY FOR EMPLOYEES IT

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:44.241
SAYS THAT. THEY HAVE TO BE-

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:46.577
UNDER THE- E. WAY THEY HAVE TO

00:45:46.643 --> 00:45:48.278
HAVE THE OPTION TO ACCEPT OR

AND ANY BENEFITS OR RISK. LIKE

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.558
I SAID I DON'T THINK A COURT

00:46:01.625 --> 00:46:05.262
HAS RULED ON THIS BUT- IT'S MY

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:06.730
AND AGAIN I'M NOT A LAWYER

00:46:06.797 --> 00:46:07.798
BARELY GRADUATED FROM HIGH

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.099
SCHOOL WENT TO A CONTINUATION

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:11.068
HIGH SCHOOL SO YOU KNOW IT'S

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:13.103
PRETTY ROTTEN KID- BUT BASED ON

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.471
MY INTERPRETATION THE FIRST

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.106
SEGMENT. OF THE SUB CLASS

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:18.442
SUGGESTS THAT- MANDATES ARE

00:46:18.509 --> 00:46:20.811
CATEGORICALLY PROHIBITED- SINCE

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:23.247
EACH PERSON MUST HAVE THE

00:46:23.313 --> 00:46:25.516
OPTION TO ACCEPT OR REFUSE. OF

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:29.386
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- SO

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:29.953
YOU'RE BRINGING UP A REALLY

00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:32.789
GOOD QUESTION- SO IN GENERAL

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:35.526
WITH VACCINE WITH VACCINES- WE

00:46:35.592 --> 00:46:37.694
BASICALLY HAVE THREE KEY

00:46:37.761 --> 00:46:40.164
STRATEGIES- THE FIRST DREADED

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:42.166
USED TO RECOMMEND THE VACCINE

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:43.634
ANOTHER ANOTHER STRATEGIES TO

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:45.068
HAVE A VACCINE MANDATED IN

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.770
ANOTHER STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE

00:46:46.837 --> 00:46:48.739
INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE TO BECOME

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.974
VACCINATED- THANK YOU MICHAEL

00:46:51.041 --> 00:46:53.944
MANDATE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A

00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:55.245
PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:58.248
HEALTH OFFICER. WOULD IN

00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:00.083
GENERAL WHICH WOULD DO IT'S

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:01.385
SOMETHING THAT REALLY WOULD IN

00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:03.320
MY MIND- WE REALLY HAVE TO GO

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.322
THROUGH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS-

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:06.790
AND I WOULD NOT EXPECT THAT TO

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.325
EVEN BE AN ISSUE UNTIL IT

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:11.128
BECAME NOT FULLY STA APPROVED-

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:12.663
SOME TELL YOU I'M GIVING YOU MY

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:13.764
PERSPECTIVE AS A FROM FROM A

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.399
PUBLIC HEALTH. AND HEALTH

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:18.335
OFFICER PERSPECTIVE- IN GENERAL

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:19.636
WE WOULD NOT WE WOULD NOT

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:24.107
RESORT TO- MANDATING A VACCINE.

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:27.411
OKAY SO- TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:29.046
ON THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION

00:47:29.112 --> 00:47:30.981
IT ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THE PUBLIC

00:47:31.048 --> 00:47:32.115
HEALTH OR EXCUSE ME HEALTH

00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:35.252
FAIRS ANALYSIS- OF THE LANGUAGE

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:36.753
THAT'S IN THAT CODE SECTION

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.088
BECAUSE WORRY IT YOU KNOW WE'RE

00:47:38.155 --> 00:47:38.989
DEALING WITH THE EASY WAY

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:42.226
VERSUS A ACTUALLY FDA APPROVED

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:42.759
VACCINE WHEN IT COMES THE

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:46.597
COVERT VACCINE. AND- I GUESS

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:48.165
THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:49.766
THERE IS A GREAT NUMBER OF

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:50.467
EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.336
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE REQUIRING

00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:54.137
EMPLOYEES TO BE VACCINATED IN

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.073
ORDER- WELL THEY DON'T REALLY

00:47:56.139 --> 00:47:57.741
SAY IT SO THEY'RE VIOLATING THE

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.276
FIRST RULE BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:47:59.343 --> 00:47:59.810
PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEE WITH

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:02.613
OPTIONS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:05.082
REFUSING THE PRODUCT BUT UNDER

00:48:05.148 --> 00:48:06.783
THE EMERGENCY YOU THOUGHT THE

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:10.354
AUTHORIZATION THE MANDATE-

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:11.688
CAN'T REALLY BE MANDATED

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:13.523
BECAUSE- IT'S NOT A FULLY FDA

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:16.426
APPROVED. VACCINES SO IS IT

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:18.862
YOUR OPINION THAT- BASED ON

00:48:18.929 --> 00:48:21.031
JUST WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I MEAN

00:48:21.098 --> 00:48:22.399
IS IT RIGHT OR WHAT'S YOUR

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:24.601
OPINION IF EMPLOYERS SAY YOU

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:25.402
KNOW YOU CAN NO LONGER BE

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:26.203
EMPLOYED HERE UNLESS YOU GET

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.871
THIS CODE THAT. YOU'RE ASKING A

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:30.240
VERY A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I

00:48:30.307 --> 00:48:34.678
HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY- I DO WE

00:48:34.745 --> 00:48:36.079
DO WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING

00:48:36.146 --> 00:48:39.716
ON VACCINES IS- AND- IS TO

00:48:39.783 --> 00:48:43.153
ENCOURAGE INCENTIVIZE. AS MANY

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.821
PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE TO GET

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.657
VACCINATED AS A WAY TO FIGHT

00:48:46.723 --> 00:48:47.824
THE PANDEMIC AND THAT'S BEEN

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.226
OUR PRODUCT AND THAT'S BEEN OUR

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.995
PRIMARY. APPROACH WE RECOGNIZE

00:48:52.062 --> 00:48:53.563
SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:56.466
MANDATING MANDATING WE HAVE TO

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:57.367
BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE TO

00:48:57.434 --> 00:48:58.635
BE DONE THROUGH A LEGISLATIVE

00:48:58.702 --> 00:48:59.836

DEAL WITH OUR COMMUNITIES WE

00:57:27.277 --> 00:57:28.311

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.789
QUESTIONS. THE ONLY.

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.958
OUTSTANDING QUESTION I WOULD

ASK AS IT RELATES TO. OBVIOUSLY

00:58:17.427 --> 00:58:20.396
THE PANDEMIC WERE IN BUT- THE

00:58:20.463 --> 00:58:22.432
ISSUE OF DATA THAT HAS COME UP

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.200
OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

COMMUNITIES THAT WE WERE AWARE

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:49.993
OF SO WE GET THE DATA AND WE

00:58:50.059 --> 00:58:51.928
SEE. THE NUMBERS RELATED TO THE

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:54.397

ABLE TO BACK UP AND GET ANY

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.117
INFORMATION THAT WE WEREN'T

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:15.985
GETTING THAT ALSO INCLUDES THE

00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.354
LGBTQ COMMUNITY BECAUSE- YOU

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.722
KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LEFT OUT OF

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:22.225
THE DATA COLLECTION. IT'S

00:59:22.292 --> 00:59:23.593
PROBLEMATIC AS WE'VE SEEN

00:59:23.660 --> 00:59:25.561
HISTORICALLY WOMEN WERE LEFT

00:59:25.628 --> 00:59:27.297
OUT OF DATA COLLECTION AND

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:28.564
STUDIES AND THINGS THAT COULD

00:59:28.631 --> 00:59:32.235
HELP US BE. BETTER TREATED. AND

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:32.936
THAT'S TRUE FOR SO MANY

00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:35.338
COMMUNITIES AND WE THOUGHT WE

00:59:35.405 --> 00:59:37.307
WOULD BE FURTHER AHEAD ON. ON

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:38.975
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.443
COLLECTING DATA THERE AND IT

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.178
TURNS OUT WE WEREN'T I DON'T

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:44.714
THINK. SO WE YOU JST COMMENT

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.783
ON ON THE DATA PIECE AND

00:59:46.849 --> 00:59:48.117
WHETHER WE CAN BACK UP AND-

00:59:48.184 --> 00:59:50.086
CORRECT. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.955
IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT

00:59:52.021 --> 00:59:54.090
QUESTION SO. IN TWENTY ELEVEN

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:55.024
WHEN I BECAME TO HELP OFFICERS

00:59:55.091 --> 00:59:56.559
SAN FRANCISCO ONE OF THE FIRST

00:59:56.626 --> 00:59:58.127
THINGS WE DID WAS. WE BROUGHT

00:59:58.194 --> 00:59:59.996
TOGETHER A TEAM- INCLUDING

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.464
STAKEHOLDERS AND WE DEVELOPED

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.199
BY ACTUALLY ONE OF THE FIRST.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.467
GUIDELINES PROBABLY IN THE

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:05.802
COUNTRY I KNOW CERTAINLY THE

01:00:05.868 --> 01:00:07.503
STATE AT THAT TIME. GUIDELINES

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.205
ON COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.773
RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.942
ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:14.243
AND SOMETHING WE GIVE ALL THREE

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.712
SEPARATE GUIDELINES THAT REALLY

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.280
BECAME THE BASIS. OF WHAT OTHER

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.915
FOLKS CAN'T IT'S INCREDIBLY

01:00:18.982 --> 01:00:22.585
IMPORTANT. AND AND IT IT- IT

01:00:22.652 --> 01:00:23.853
REQUIRED FOR US TO DO IT

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.421
CORRECTLY REALLY REQUIRED US BY

01:00:25.488 --> 01:00:26.422
WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:27.390
COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.891
WE GOT IT RIGHT. WE TRY TO

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.293
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW TO ASK

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.462
THE QUESTIONS. AND THE NFL TIME

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.997
IT WAS REALLY PRIMARILY

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:35.298
DIRECTED AROUND HEALTHCARE

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:37.367
SERVICES HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.168
IS SO LITTLE DIFFERENCE I MEAN

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.771
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ELECTRONIC

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.639
MEDICAL RECORDS YOUR PROVIDER.

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:48.077
AS THE SYSTEM. IS A LITTLE BIT

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:48.578
EASIER SET SET UP. WITH

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.045
COMMUNICABLE DISEASES

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:49.879
COMMUTABLE DISEASES AS WELL BUT-

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.914
SO WE HAVE A SERVER. SYSTEM

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.349
WHERE HEALTH SYSTEMS FOR

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:55.885
LABORATORIES. PROVIDE US THE

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:57.954
DATA. AND OFTENTIMES THE DATA

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:01.024
THAT COMES IS VERY LIMITED SELF

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.425
A LOT OF THE LAB SLIP IS

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:04.560
POSITIVE OFTENTIMES IT DOESN'T

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:05.795
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:07.330
WE WOULD WANT ON THAT SPECIFIC

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:09.298
CASE. AS TO WHETHER CHALLENGES

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:11.067
WE HAD WITH FACT BECAUSE IT IS

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:12.402
THAT IF THE INFORMATION WASN'T

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.670
COLLECTED BY THE PROVIDER OR

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:17.573
WASN'T- USUALLY THE LABS ARE

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.042
NOT GOING TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.243
INFORMATION IN ADDITIONAL

01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:22.011
INFORMATION. AND THEN WE SAID

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.946
WITH THEIR SIGHTS SET UP ALL

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.114
ACROSS THE STATE TO TEST AS

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:27.450
MANY PEOPLE I NEED A TESTING.

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.719
SO IS SPECIALLY EARLY ON AND WE

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:31.087
DID WE DID NOT EVEN HAVE A GOOD

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.089
RACE ETHNICITY DATA IT WAS VERY

01:01:33.156 --> 01:01:34.557
BAD. AND IT TOOK IT TOOK A

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:36.359
WHILE TO GET THE IMPROVE THOSE

01:01:36.426 --> 01:01:38.227
SYSTEMS UP. THE GENDER IDENTITY

01:01:38.294 --> 01:01:40.563
DATA DID EVENTUALLY IMPROVED A

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.964
ONE OF THE BIG GAP AREAS

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:42.732
CONTINUES TO BE SEXUAL

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:44.567
ORIENTATION. AND THAT ALSO

01:01:44.634 --> 01:01:45.902
CONTINUE TO BE TRUE ALSO FOR

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:46.969
VACCINATIONS THE FOR

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.204
VACCINATIONS YOU CAN GET

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.839
INFORMATION ON GENDER IDENTITY.

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.441
BOB I'M NOT SEXUAL ORIENTATION

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.609
SO THESE ARE CAP AREAS THAT WE

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.878
ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FIX. BOB AND

01:01:55.945 --> 01:01:57.947
I AND I AGREE I AGREE WITH YOU-

01:01:58.014 --> 01:01:59.348
IF WE DON'T IF WE DON'T MEASURE

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:00.383
THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:03.052
RECOGNIZE. I ISSUES AND IT'S A

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:09.492
VERY IT'S AN INEQUITY THAT. WE

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.093
NEED TO WE NEED TO ELIMINATE.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:10.693
WELL THANK YOU DOC HOPEFUL YOU

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:07.622
AGGREGATION THEY HAVE. LOOK FOR

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.624
WAYS TO DO RENEWABLE ENERGY AS

01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:13.061
PART OF THE PORTFOLIO AND

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.863
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.531
HAS HAD A MIXED REVIEW AT THE

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.066
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION I

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.768
KNOW I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT ONE

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:22.404
OF THE STRONGEST ONES THAT GOES

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:22.904
FROM SANTA CRUZ TO SANTA

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:25.273
BARBARA COUNTY. AND OFFERS

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.942
RATES THAT ARE LOWER THAN THE

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:29.411
COMPETING RATES OF THE PUBLIC

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.713
UTILITIES. WHAT'S YOUR VIEW

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:32.981
ABOUT COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:34.583
AGGREGATION AND HOW IT FITS%

01:17:34.649 --> 01:17:35.917
INTO THE SCHEME THAT YOU WILL

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.586
DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:40.889
COMMISSION. THE COMMUNITY

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:42.424
CHOICE AGGREGATION HAS

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.593
INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LAST

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:46.595
FEW YEARS AND I THINK THAT- IT

01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:48.463
CHANGES THE DYNAMIC AND HOW THE

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.899
UC REGULATES AND WE ARE WORKING

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:53.602
THROUGH- THOSE DYNAMICS SO IT

01:17:53.668 --> 01:17:55.570
IT DOES CREATE CHANGES TO HOW

01:17:55.637 --> 01:17:57.439
WE REGULATE I THINK A COMMUNITY

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:59.007
CHOICE AGGREGATORS ALSO CAN

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:00.942
PROVIDE. ADVANTAGES BY

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.944
REPRESENTING THEIR LOCAL

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.346
COMMUNITIES THEY'RE SMALLER SO

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.681
THEY- HAVE SOME ADVANTAGES IN

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:08.483
BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.352
PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TO

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.521
SERVE THEIR CUSTOMERS IN WAYS

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.522
THAT MAKE IT A LARGER LARGER

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.556
UTILITIES MAY HAVE MORE

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:18.493
DIFFICULTIES WITH- BUT AGAIN IF

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.429
IT DOES CHANGE THE WAY WE DO

01:18:20.495 --> 01:18:21.496
THINGS SO I THINK IT'S- GONNA

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:24.466
REQUIRE. BALANCING THE INTEREST

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.668
OF ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAKING

01:18:26.735 --> 01:18:28.203
SURE THAT THAT COMMUNITY CHOICE

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.372
AGGREGATE CUSTOMERS ARE ABLE TO

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:31.940
HAVE FAIR AFFORDABLE REASONABLE

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:33.375
RATES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.210
BALANCING THE ISSUE OF.

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:37.012
ENSURING THAT SOME OF OUR MOST

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:38.713
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.981

CHOICE AGGREGATE ARE- BEARING

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:45.921
THE BURDEN OF ADDITIONAL COST-

01:18:45.987 --> 01:18:48.123
SO IT WILL BE A BALANCING ACT

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:51.126
BUT- AND I THAT SOME. THERE'S A

01:18:51.193 --> 01:18:52.561

WHEN IS THE **** ENERGY

01:19:58.093 --> 01:20:03.265
METERING AND I THINK THAT KIND.

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.299
TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF

01:20:04.366 --> 01:20:06.434
BALANCING AND THE FACT THAT TO

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.470
OUR- THE WEALTHIER HOUSEHOLDS

ARE REALLY HAVE AN ADVANTAGE

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:13.208
OVER OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.410
IN TERMS OF THE NET ENERGY

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:18.079
METERING NET INNER G. METERING

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.015

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:24.986
THINK I'D LIKE SOMETHING THAT'S

01:20:25.053 --> 01:20:26.755
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC IF

01:20:26.821 --> 01:20:28.823

YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD-

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.396
ARE YOU DEVELOPING ANY CRITERIA

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.364
BY WHICH YOU CAN EVALUATE.

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:38.833
POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:40.902
PROGRAM ARE STILL THAT YOU'RE

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:42.604
MOVING TOWARDS BALANCING IT

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.105
WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.074
BELIEVE BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:48.343
BENEFITING BY- THE CURRENT

01:20:48.410 --> 01:20:52.614
PROGRAM. WITH THE- THE SOLAR

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:54.783
ENERGY TO THE HOMES OF ARE

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.384
GOING TO AT SOME POINT BE

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:58.853
IMPACTED AS THEY YOU KNOW THE

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.389
PROMISES MADE THEY WILL FEEL

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:02.624
WE'RE NOT CAP TO BECAUSE THEY

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.793
WERE ARE INCENTIVIZED TO DO

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.228
THAT BY THE FACT THAT THEY ARE

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:07.929
GETTING CREDIT RATHER THAN

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:09.631
MAKING A LARGE PAYMENT BUT

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.799
OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER COMPONENTS

01:21:10.865 --> 01:21:12.934
OF. ENERGY DELIVERY TO THEIR

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.502
HOMES AND BUSINESSES ARE

01:21:14.569 --> 01:21:16.371
CLEARLY REQUIRED MORE

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.473
INVESTMENT HE ON THE GRID AND

01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:19.407
ALL THE TRANSMISSION ALL THAT

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:57.579
RECORD BEING DEVELOPED RIGHT

FRONT OF LEGISLATION THAT'S-

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:07.849
CURRENTLY IN THE HOPPER THAT

MAY HAVE TO MOVE IN THAT

01:23:16.124 --> 01:23:17.058
DIRECTION BECAUSE AGAIN THE

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.793
BALANCE. BECOMES EXTREMELY

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.061
IMPORTANT TO BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:22.263
ISSUE ARE CLEARLY AND IT'S

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.232
ALWAYS IMPORTANT SHOW THAT OUR

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.534
PUBLIC KNOWS. THAT THIS IS

01:23:26.601 --> 01:23:28.169

THEY SEE BOTH POSITIVE AND

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.409
NEGATIVE GOING FORWARD SO THERE

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:36.044
IS A BALANCE AND- EVERYBODY'S

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.279
GONNA SHARE. IN THE BENEFITS

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:39.314
AND CERTAINLY A LITTLE BIT OF

01:23:39.381 --> 01:23:40.915
THE BURDENS IF THAT'S GOING TO

01:23:40.982 --> 01:23:42.851
BE THE DECISION. ARE YOU ALSO

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:44.085
SET A TOP PRIORITY WAS

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:45.520
BROADBAND ARE NOT GOING TO GET

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.655
INTO THAT DEEPLY- I KNOW SOME

01:23:47.722 --> 01:23:49.257
OF THE OTHER ON COLLEAGUES HERE

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.825
WILL WANT TO ASK ABOUT THAT.

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.360
BUT OUR DISCUSSION WAS ABOUT

01:23:52.427 --> 01:23:54.362
THE- COMMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:57.365
OF- QUITE A NUMBER OF TIMES BY

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:58.900
FELLOW OF SENATE COLLEAGUE

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:00.502
REGARDING THE FACT THAT WE

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.370
PUTTING A LOT OF MONEY INTO. A

01:24:02.437 --> 01:24:05.073
DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUES SUB THE

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.608
MIDDLE THE MIDDLE MAN AND I

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:08.009
THINK IT'S CALLED. THAT WE

01:24:08.076 --> 01:24:10.044
DON'T SEE ANY ON ANY PROJECTS

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:11.980
YET AND I A LOT OF IT IS GOING

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:14.682

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:28.590
MILE WHICH CAN'T WAIT TO-

01:25:28.656 --> 01:25:30.592
SOMETHING I CAN TO TRANSMISSION

01:25:30.658 --> 01:25:33.027

THEN ANOTHER THREE BILLION

01:25:43.838 --> 01:25:45.173
LOOKING AT WHAT'S REFERRED TO

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.742
AS LAST MILE WHICH IS- THE

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:51.412
ACTUAL CONNECTION. THAT MINDSET

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:55.049

INFRASTRUCTURE IN A WAY THAT

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:03.124
PROVIDES OPEN ACCESS WHICH

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.459
WOULD ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:06.928
TRIBES AND OTHER ENTITIES TO BE

01:26:06.995 --> 01:26:09.130
ABLE TO ACCESS THE SYSTEM AT A

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:12.000
REASONABLE RATE RIGHT NOW-

01:26:12.066 --> 01:26:13.568
WE'RE MISSING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:14.769
WHICH IS CREATED GAPS AND THE

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:23.711
DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING IT

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.780
BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN OPEN ACCESS

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.016
SYSTEM SO WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO

01:26:28.082 --> 01:26:33.922
DO IS- BE ABLE TO. ASSIST WITH

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.423

SAN DIEGO BREEZE OKAY SO AND

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:30.952
THE LAST FEW DAYS SPECIFICALLY

01:31:31.018 --> 01:31:32.553
IN MY AREA IT'S BEEN A HUNDRED

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:33.621
AND NINE AND A HUNDRED AND TEN

01:31:33.688 --> 01:31:35.656
DEGREES I THINK LOS ANGELES I

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:37.325
MAY NOT HAVE THOSE HIGH NUMBERS

01:31:37.391 --> 01:31:40.061
BUT- IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HOTTER

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:42.029
IN OUR DISTRICTS THAN IT IS-

01:31:42.096 --> 01:31:44.432
OVER ON THE COAST. THERE WAS A

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:47.268
RECENTLY HELD- THE CPC RECENTLY

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.036
HELD A HEARING RECOGNIZING THE

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:50.371
PARTICULARLY HIGH ELECTRICITY

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.640
RATES IN CALIFORNIA AND IN FACT

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:53.608
CALIFORNIA'S ELECTRICITY RATES

01:31:53.674 --> 01:31:55.409
ARE DOUBLE THE NATIONAL

01:31:55.476 --> 01:31:57.879
AVERAGE- THE WHITE PAPER FROM

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.380
THAT MEETING BASICALLY KINDA I

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:00.982
DON'T SEE BRUSHES IT OFF THE

01:32:01.048 --> 01:32:01.649
BRUSHES IT OFF SAYS MOST

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:04.051
CALIFORNIANS ELECTRICITY BILLS

01:32:04.118 --> 01:32:05.553
ARE RELATIVELY LOW WHICH IS

01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:09.090
TRUE. THAT'S ON PAGE SEVEN OF

01:32:09.156 --> 01:32:09.790
THE WHITE PAPER THAT WAS

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:12.793
PROVIDED AND BUT THAT'S TRUE

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:14.095
FOR THE COASTAL AREAS AND MAYBE

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:15.630
IN THE SAN DIEGO AREA BUT IT'S

01:32:15.696 --> 01:32:16.831
NOT TRUE FOR THE MAJORITY OF

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:19.600
THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE CENTRAL

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:20.134
VALLEY LOS ANGELES OR THE

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.569
REGION'S. AND WHAT WOULD YOU

01:32:21.636 --> 01:32:22.904
SAY TO CONSTITUENTS LIKE IN MY

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:26.240
DISTRICT OR LOS ANGELES- THAT

01:32:26.307 --> 01:32:27.942
FACE TRIPLE DIGIT TEMPERATURES

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:29.610
FOR THE SUMMER MENCE THAT HAVE

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:32.480
EXTREMELY HIGH. UTILITY RATES I

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:33.915
MEAN SOME OF THEM EVEN IF YOU

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:34.615
KEEP YOUR AIR CONDITIONER

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:36.550
THEY'RE NOT ON YOU'RE NOT. ABLE

01:32:36.617 --> 01:32:37.885
TO BE ON THE CARES PROGRAM

01:32:37.952 --> 01:32:38.853
BECAUSE YOU'RE A WORKING

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.088
CALIFORNIAN THAT MAKES FAST

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:42.223
ENOUGH TO NOT BE ON THE CARES

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:44.992
PROGRAM. AND THESE INDIVIDUALS

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.394
MIGHT FACE EVEN KEEPING THEIR

01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.929
AIR CONDITIONER EIGHTY DEGREES

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:49.797
A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR P. GENIE

01:32:49.864 --> 01:32:51.532
BILL OR ELECTRICITY BILL AND

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:53.901
WHICH IS ABOUT. PROBABLY A

01:32:53.968 --> 01:33:00.374
THIRD OF THEIR INCOME. THANK

01:33:00.441 --> 01:33:02.143
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND AS AS

01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:03.611
WE DISCUSSED WHEN WE MET

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.680
AFFORDABILITY IS. A CRITICAL

01:33:05.746 --> 01:33:07.181
ISSUE THAT'S FRONT AND CENTER

01:33:07.248 --> 01:33:09.650
AT THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW WE-

01:33:09.717 --> 01:33:11.118
NEED TO DO FOLLOW UP FROM OUR

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:13.287
END BOND WE ALSO HAVE AN OPEN

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.956
PORTABILITY PRECEDING THAT

01:33:15.022 --> 01:33:17.325
RECENTLY ISSUED. A REPORT AND

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:18.225
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:20.861
REPORT RECOGNIZES AS AS YOU'VE

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.431
INDICATED SENATOR THAT- WE NEED

01:33:23.497 --> 01:33:24.732
TO BE LOOKING AT AFFORDABILITY

01:33:24.799 --> 01:33:26.801
FROM A REGIONAL LEVEL AS

01:33:26.867 --> 01:33:28.669
OPPOSED TO A STATEWIDE LEVEL

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:29.603
BECAUSE THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:31.539
INCOMES- WITHIN DIFFERENT

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:33.107
REGIONS AND THERE'S DIFFERENT-

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.675
CLIMATE FACTORS WITHIN THOSE

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.510
REGIONS. AND SO WE ARE IN THE

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:38.512
PROCESS OF DEVELOPING METRICS

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:40.247
THAT WILL HELP US BE ABLE TO

01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.917
LOOK AT- AFFORDABILITY ACROSS

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.186
ALL OF OUR UTILITY SECTORS AND

01:33:45.252 --> 01:33:46.921
LOOKING AT IT. FROM A REGIONAL

01:33:46.988 --> 01:33:48.956
PERSPECTIVE TO ASSIST US IN

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:50.858
DEVELOPING BETTER PROGRAMS

01:33:50.925 --> 01:33:54.261
LOOKING AT POSSIBLE- CHANGES TO

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:56.530
OUR RATE DESIGN AND HELPING TO

01:33:56.597 --> 01:33:58.933
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACCOUNTING

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.301
FOR AFFORDABILITY BITE BY

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:02.970
HOUSEHOLD LEVEL- AS AS YOU

01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:05.873
NOTED- OUR OUR ELECTRICITY-

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:09.477
HELLO

01:34:09.543 --> 01:34:11.312
END IF YOU LOOK AT NATIONAL

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:13.714
AVERAGES ARE ARE BILLED AS A

01:34:13.781 --> 01:34:15.683
STATE ARE ON THE LOWER END FOR

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.318
NATURAL THE NATIONAL AVERAGES

01:34:17.385 --> 01:34:20.388
BUT WE SEE A TREND. THAT THOSE

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:21.822
RATES ARE INCREASING AND WE'RE

01:34:21.889 --> 01:34:24.325
PARTICULARLY NOTING THAT- THERE

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:28.229
ARE REGIONAL. IMPACTS THAT NEED

01:34:28.295 --> 01:34:30.164
TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR- SO WHAT

01:34:30.231 --> 01:34:32.500
WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY TO- THE

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.001
CONSTITUENTS FACING THOSE

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:35.803
ISSUES IS THAT WE DO HAVE THIS

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.471
RECEDING WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS

01:34:37.538 --> 01:34:40.441
ISSUE. WE ARE HOPING- TO BE

01:34:40.508 --> 01:34:42.009
ABLE TO HAVE METRICS THAT WILL

01:34:42.076 --> 01:34:44.445
ALLOW US FOR. TWO ACCOUNTS FOR

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:48.249
THESE REGIONAL DIFFERENCES AND-

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:50.518
HOUSEHOLD INCOME FACTORS AND

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:52.586
THAT IT BE- NEED. CUSTOMER

01:34:52.653 --> 01:34:54.588
PARTICIPATION MORE CONSTITUENT

01:34:54.655 --> 01:34:57.625
PARTICIPATION AND- I ANTICIPATE

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.692
THAT WE WILL BE DOING MORE

01:34:58.759 --> 01:35:01.629
WORKSHOPS AND OUTREACH AND-

01:35:01.695 --> 01:35:03.731
THIS AGAIN REMAINS A ISSUE THAT

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:05.166
IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND A

01:35:05.232 --> 01:35:06.767
TOP PRIORITY FOR US AND WE

01:35:06.834 --> 01:35:08.402
LOOKING AT IT HOW WE ASSESS

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:11.739
AFFORDABILITY- ON A REGIONAL

01:35:11.806 --> 01:35:12.773
BASIS. THANK YOU MA'AM VERY

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:14.275
MUCH FOR THAT RESPONSE I REALLY

01:35:14.341 --> 01:35:16.277
APPRECIATE IT- I AM

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:19.146
ECSTATICALLY EXCITED THAT- YOU

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:20.714
SEE CALIFORNIA IN DIFFERENT

01:35:20.781 --> 01:35:22.216
REGIONS AND- HOW DIFFERENT

01:35:22.283 --> 01:35:25.753
REGIONS CAN HAVE AS A LARGE

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:28.422
VARIANCE OF- I'VE UTILITY

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:31.358
RATES. JUST BASED ON ON THE

01:35:31.425 --> 01:35:31.926
CLIMB INTO THE AREA OF THE

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:35.930
REGION IS AND SO- YOU KNOW AS

01:35:35.996 --> 01:35:37.164
THERE'S ALWAYS FREQUENTLY ASKED

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:38.599
QUESTIONS REGARDING RATE REALLY

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:39.633
FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS

01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.602
THROUGH THE PROGRAMS LIKE HERE.

01:35:41.669 --> 01:35:43.170
BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF RATE

01:35:43.237 --> 01:35:44.572
RELIEF SOLUTIONS FOR INDUSTRIAL

01:35:44.638 --> 01:35:46.273
OR AGRICULTURAL CUSTOMERS HE'S

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:46.841
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:48.409
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. THAN

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:50.010
COMPETITORS IN NEIGHBORING

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:52.113
STATES. THE REASON WHY I ASK

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:54.115
THAT IS. IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:57.818
THE LARGEST A- TAITO PRODUCER I

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:58.352
GUESS ANY FINGERLING MANY

01:35:58.419 --> 01:36:01.222
POTATO. PURPLE POTATO YELLOW

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:02.990
POTATO THOSE LITTLE MINI ROUND

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:04.458
ONES THAT YOU BUY AT COSTCO OR

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:07.194
WALMART OR- I HAVE BONDS I MEAN

01:36:07.261 --> 01:36:08.429
THEY'RE SOLD EVERYWHERE SO

01:36:08.496 --> 01:36:10.097
FINGERLINGS THAT'S A SPECIALTY

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:13.000
AS WELL- TO REFRIGERATE THEM IT

01:36:13.067 --> 01:36:14.802
THE RATES- HAVE ALMOST

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:16.770
QUADRUPLED IN THE LAST YEAR FOR

01:36:16.837 --> 01:36:17.471
THEM TO BE ABLE TO

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.807
REFRIGERATED. THEY'RE TALKING

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:22.109
ABOUT MOVING TO ARIZONA. JUST A

01:36:22.176 --> 01:36:23.043
WAREHOUSE OR STUFF BECAUSE IT

01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.311
WOULD BE CHEAPER TO TRANSPORT

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:27.148
THEM VIA TRACK. YOU KNOW ACROSS

01:36:27.214 --> 01:36:28.349
STATE LINES WHERE THEY NEEDED

01:36:28.415 --> 01:36:30.017
TO BE DISTRIBUTED THEN IT WOULD

01:36:30.084 --> 01:36:34.221
BE T. PAY UTILITY RATES- ALSO-

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.623
YOU LARGEST BABY CARE PRODUCER

01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:37.057
IN THE WORLD IS IN MY

01:36:37.124 --> 01:36:39.193
DISTRACTION TO MY COLLEAGUE MR

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.394
TUDOSE DISTRICT BUT IN KERN

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:43.264
COUNTY. AND THEY HIS SIT FACE

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:45.332
THE SIMILAR SITUATION- THEY'VE

01:36:45.399 --> 01:36:46.333
ACTUALLY STARTED PURCHASING

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:48.102
LANDIN AND PROPERTY IN

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:50.304
GEORGIA. WE HATE TO LOSE THOSE

01:36:50.371 --> 01:36:52.439
BUSINESSES- BUT ONE OF THE MAIN

01:36:52.506 --> 01:36:54.475
FACTORS THAT THEY'VE DECIDED.

01:36:54.542 --> 01:36:56.510
IS UTILITY RATES- FOR

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.078
REFRIGERATING THESE PRODUCTS

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.346
WHETHER IT'S POTATOES CARROTS

01:36:59.413 --> 01:37:01.482
PLUMS APPLES DOESN'T MATTER.

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:03.217
AND THE UTILITY RATES IS THERE

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:05.886
A SOLUTION THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:07.655
REGARDING THE ECONOMIC BURDENS

01:37:07.721 --> 01:37:08.989
THAT THE STATE'S BUSINESSES AND

01:37:09.056 --> 01:37:10.324
FARMS FACE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH

01:37:10.391 --> 01:37:13.928
UTILITY. RATES- ELECTRICITY

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:17.965
RATES. THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:20.734
QUESTION- SENATOR AYE AGAIN A

01:37:20.801 --> 01:37:24.939
PORTABILITY- IS VERY IMPORTANT-

01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:27.107
TO THE PC AND WE ARE. LOOKING

01:37:27.174 --> 01:37:29.843
AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO- ANALYZE

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:30.911
FORTY BOARD ABILITY FOR

01:37:30.978 --> 01:37:32.613
DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT SECTORS

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.149
OF- BOTH THE ECONOMY AND-

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:37.785
CUSTOMER BASE I DO NOT HAVE. A

01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:39.653
SPECIFIC ANSWER REGARDING A

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.122
PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE- THAT MAY

01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:43.490
BE GEARED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS

01:37:43.557 --> 01:37:46.727
AGRICULTURE BUT- I CAN FOLLOW

01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:48.162
UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND PROVIDE

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.097
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IF YOU

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:52.266
WOULD ALLOW ME TO DO THAT. I

01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:53.167
WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:55.169
THANK YOU. THE LAST QUESTION I

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:57.137
HAVE IS- I'M SURE IT'S ALL ON

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:58.472
OUR MIND BECAUSE THE COLONIAL

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:00.774
HACK RIGHT AND- WE TALKED A

01:38:00.841 --> 01:38:01.775
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:03.277
THE COLONIAL PIPELINE HACKEN

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:04.878
AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:38:04.945 --> 01:38:06.647
THREATS THAT WE FACE IN THEM

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:09.016
ARE UTILITIES. IS OUR ENERGY IS

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:11.585
THE ENERGY GET ITSELF- AND THE

01:38:11.652 --> 01:38:13.287
POTENTIAL EXPOSURE THAT WE HAVE

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:14.588
FOR HACKING THE ENERGY GRID AND

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.523
SHUTTING DOWN AND THE STATE'S

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:19.193
POWER. AS WE TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.894
ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE IS A

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:22.896
COMPANY IN- THE SENATE PROTEAMS

01:38:22.963 --> 01:38:24.331
DISTRICT ACTUALLY AND I THINK

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:24.798
SHE KNOWS ONE OF THE

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:27.468
PRINCIPLES- FROM A PREVIOUS I

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:29.003
SEE PREVIOUS LIFE I THINK IT'S

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:31.105
WHEN SHE'S ON THE CITY COUNCIL.

01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:34.541
THE M. AS THE EQUITY TECH- HAS

AND I KNOW LIFELINE IS I THINK

01:46:20.607 --> 01:46:23.143
ONE PER HOUSEHOLD. RATHER THAN

ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING OUT AND

01:48:43.884 --> 01:48:45.852
WE'RE HOPING THAT- WITH THIS

01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:47.220

BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I THINK. I

01:48:58.899 --> 01:48:59.499
DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE

01:48:59.566 --> 01:49:02.235
LAND LINES- NOT THAT MANY AND

01:49:02.302 --> 01:49:04.104
THEN THE ONES THAT DO PROBABLY

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:04.938
DON'T REALLY EVEN KNOW WHAT THE

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:07.974

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:18.318
WAY TO ALLOW FOR CONNECTIVITY

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:19.786
TO BE EASIER FOR ALL

01:49:19.853 --> 01:49:21.488
CALIFORNIANS TO MANAGE IS

01:49:21.554 --> 01:49:23.056
REALLY IMPORTANT REGARDLESS OF

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:26.326
THEIR INCOME. I'M I KNOW THE

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:27.327
VICE CHAIR ASKED A QUESTION

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:30.630
ABOUT BROADBAND- AND SO I TO

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.399
WILL- AND I KNOW WE TALKED A

01:49:32.465 --> 01:49:35.402
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS- I THINK

01:49:35.468 --> 01:49:38.305
BASED ON. WELL WE'VE ALL SEEN

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:39.940
THE PHOTOS OF THE YOUNG BABIES

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:41.374

HAD AN INSTANCE WHERE THE PHONE

01:49:47.380 --> 01:49:49.182

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.952
WALKING AROUND THE BLOCK TRYING

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.887
TO FIND A PLACE WHERE WE'RE

01:49:53.954 --> 01:49:56.356
GETTING A GOOD SIGNAL- AND I

01:49:56.423 --> 01:49:59.225

HAS YELLED OUT BROADBAND FOR

01:50:01.394 --> 01:50:05.432

SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:19.012
THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS

01:50:19.079 --> 01:50:20.413

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:30.457
I'M IN THE HOUSEHOLDS THAT

01:50:30.523 --> 01:50:32.826

RURAL AND URBAN. AND WE HEAR

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:39.666
THE CRIES FOR HELP AND SUPPORT.

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:41.901

CONNECTIVITY- FOR EACH OF THESE.

01:50:56.616 --> 01:50:59.219
HOUSEHOLDS AND IF SO IF THERE

EARLIER. IN THIS ACTUALLY CAME

01:51:36.056 --> 01:51:38.058
UP AS A POINT OF DISCUSSION

01:51:38.124 --> 01:51:39.726
WHEN WE HAD ONE OF OUR

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:40.393
BROADBAND BILLS UP ON THE

COMMITMENT WE CAN MAKE- NOT

01:51:56.543 --> 01:51:58.745
ONLY TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT

01:51:58.812 --> 01:52:01.081

BEFORE OF BROADBAND

01:52:16.329 --> 01:52:19.199
INFRASTRUCTURE IS A- TOP

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:21.034
PRIORITY FOR ME AND THE P. YOU

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.702
SEE I THINK THAT THE CURRENT

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:25.538
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD HAVE- THE

01:52:25.605 --> 01:52:26.506
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

01:52:26.573 --> 01:52:28.408
REFERENCED EARLIER. INVESTED

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:30.844
INTO- THIS INFRASTRUCTURE WILL

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:34.080
GO A LONG WAY- IF WE CAN GET A

01:52:34.147 --> 01:52:37.217
SYSTEM THAT IS. OPEN ACCESS AND

01:52:37.283 --> 01:52:39.252
HAS A NETWORK THAT BASICALLY

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:40.253
WILL ALLOW FOR LOCAL

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.621
GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL

01:52:41.688 --> 01:52:44.858
ORGANIZATIONS AND- NETWORK

01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:47.460

01:52:50.063 --> 01:52:51.297
WILL GO A LONG WAY TO FILLING

01:52:51.364 --> 01:52:52.732
THESE GAPS AND HELPING TO

01:52:52.799 --> 01:52:54.067
IMPROVE OUR CONNECTIVITY

01:52:54.134 --> 01:52:56.136
THROUGHOUT THE STATE- I THINK

01:52:56.202 --> 01:52:58.371
COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. WE

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:00.440
REALLY SEE THE NEED- FOR

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:01.441

THAT WE HAVE IT ACCESSIBLE SO I

01:53:05.178 --> 01:53:06.579
THINK OPEN ACCESS IS GOING TO

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:07.780
BE IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

01:53:07.847 --> 01:53:10.617
CRITICAL TO DOT. AND THIS IS

01:53:10.683 --> 01:53:11.784
GOING TO INVOLVE ON

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:14.754
DISCUSSIONS. WITH A NUMBER OF

01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:17.090
DIFFERENT AGENCIES- LOOKING AT

01:53:17.157 --> 01:53:19.792
THE LEGISLATION THAT IS PENDING

01:53:19.859 --> 01:53:24.497
AS WELL AS- THE FEDERAL

01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:25.064
GOVERNMENT AS THEY HAVE- BUT

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:25.999
THE WORK CERTAIN STORIES OVER

01:53:26.065 --> 01:53:28.868
BROADBAND AS WELL SO. I THINK

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:31.738
WE ARE AT- HEY GOOD POINT

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:34.073

THE PUBLIC- REALLY

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:37.477

FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

WORLD AND WE NEED TO MAINTAIN-

01:53:49.055 --> 01:53:51.391
TECHNOLOGY AND ACCESS FOR

01:53:51.457 --> 01:53:55.195
CALIFORNIANS- TO THE INTERNET.

01:53:55.261 --> 01:53:58.498
TO ENSURE WE- CAN CONTINUE WITH

01:53:58.565 --> 01:54:01.367
OUR ECONOMY NEEDS YOU- AND SURE

01:54:01.434 --> 01:54:02.569
PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO

01:54:02.635 --> 01:54:05.038
EDUCATION- TELEMEDICINE

01:54:05.104 --> 01:54:08.107
ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AREAS IS-

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:10.276
CRITICAL SO AS I SAID BEFORE

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:11.444
YOU CAN FIT INTERNET

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:13.513
CONNECTIVITY IS MORE THAN A

01:54:13.580 --> 01:54:15.315
LUXURY IT'S BECOMING A NEED

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.617
ESPECIALLY- GIVEN THE

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:19.686
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS LAST YEAR

01:54:19.752 --> 01:54:22.088
SO I THINK- GETTING THESE

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:23.690
MIDDLE MILE GAPS IN THESE LAST

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.525
MILE STILL AND PROVIDING OPEN

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:28.061
ACCESS. WILL GO A LONG WAY I

01:54:28.127 --> 01:54:29.529
DON'T THINK IT WILL BE EASY AND

01:54:29.596 --> 01:54:31.631
I THINK- IT'S GOING TO BE

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.600
CHALLENGING BUT I AM HOPING

01:54:33.666 --> 01:54:36.536
THAT- THE PC WILL BE ABLE TO

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:37.470
MAKE IT THE DIFFERENCE IN

01:54:37.537 --> 01:54:38.471
CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER

01:54:38.538 --> 01:54:39.639
AGENCIES THAT HELP

01:54:39.706 --> 01:54:44.644
RESPONSIBILITY HERE AND- LOOK

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:46.646
FORWARD TO. YOU- THE CASF

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:49.482
PROGRAM- MOVING FORWARD WITH

01:54:49.549 --> 01:54:55.121
THE NEXT STAGE. YEAH SO IS IT-

01:54:55.188 --> 01:54:57.724
IN THE END YOU DO NOT HAVE THE

01:54:57.790 --> 01:55:03.663
MAGIC WAND OR THE CRYSTAL BALL-

01:55:03.730 --> 01:55:04.897
HELLO I AM GOOD I'M PUTTING

01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:06.466
THAT OUT THERE FOR ALL TO NOTE

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:09.035
TO ALL FOR ALL TO HEAR- BUT

01:55:09.102 --> 01:55:11.571
WHAT IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WE

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:15.441
DON'T QUITE HAVE. A PLAN WITH

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:18.778
REAL NUMBERS ARE BENCHMARKS- ON

01:55:18.845 --> 01:55:21.247
HOW TO GET CONNECTIVITY TO THE

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:22.382
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF FOLKS

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:23.716
THAT DON'T YET HAVE IT THAT WE

01:55:23.783 --> 01:55:25.051
MAY BE WORKING ON IT BUT WITH

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:27.787
AS OF TODAY WORDS WE MAY NOT BE

01:55:27.854 --> 01:55:32.091
THERE YET. I THINK THAT'S FAIR

01:55:32.158 --> 01:55:33.559
TO SAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON

01:55:33.626 --> 01:55:39.399
IT- WE- ARE LOOKING TO SEE-

01:55:39.465 --> 01:55:42.435
WHAT. THE CASF PROGRAM IS GONNA

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:44.003
LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD IF YOU

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.338
YOU KNOW THE CURRENT PROPOSED

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:47.307
PROPOSAL ALSO TALKS ABOUT

01:55:47.373 --> 01:55:50.643
DOING- RNP IS AS OPPOSED TO

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:51.978
APPLICATIONS AND HOPEFULLY THAT

01:55:52.045 --> 01:55:55.648
WILL HELP- GET. MORE PROVIDERS

01:55:55.715 --> 01:55:59.719
AND APPLICATIONS IN THE DORK-

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:03.923
AND THE GOAL IS TO GET- YOU

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:05.191
KNOW THAT THE FIBER IN THE

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.826
GROUND TO GET THINGS MOVING BUT

01:56:06.893 --> 01:56:09.295
I CAN'T GIVE YOU AN EXACT DATES

01:56:09.362 --> 01:56:11.664
OR TIMEFRAMES- THERE'S STILL A

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:14.233
LOT OF QUESTIONS OUT THERE AS

01:56:14.300 --> 01:56:15.702
FAR AS WHAT THE PARAMETERS WILL

01:56:15.768 --> 01:56:18.171
BE THAT WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH

01:56:18.237 --> 01:56:21.341
AND- FORWARD. YEAH THAT THAT'S

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:23.643
WHY I PREFACED WHAT I SAID WITH

01:56:23.710 --> 01:56:25.678
YOU NOT HAVING A MAGIC WAND I

01:56:25.745 --> 01:56:27.413
DIDN'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT.

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:31.084
THAT WAS ALL LIES ON YOU- YOU

01:56:31.150 --> 01:56:31.984
DID MENTION LOOKING AT

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:34.187
LEGISLATION- WORKING WITH THE

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:35.555
FEDS AND THEN BRINGING OTHER

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:38.024
AGENCIES TO THE TABLE I WOULD

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:40.927
JUST ALSO ENCOURAGE- THAT WE-

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:42.695
CONSIDER HOW TO BRING OUR-

01:56:42.762 --> 01:56:44.897
TELECOM PROVIDERS TO THE TABLE

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.766
TO BECAUSE THEY ARE ENDING I

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:48.000
MEAN THEY'RE CRITICAL TO THIS

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:52.171
DISCUSSION- AND- THE REALITY IS

01:56:52.238 --> 01:56:54.006
THAT MOST CALIFORNIANS DON'T

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:55.475
REALLY KNOW WHAT THE P. YOU SEE

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:57.744
DOES. AND THERE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:56:57.810 --> 01:56:59.679
THIS VERY INTRICATE WEB OF

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:02.348
AGENCIES AND CONNECTIONS THAT

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:04.517
WE MAY HAVE OR KNOW ABOUT WHEN

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:05.885
THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW COME

01:57:05.952 --> 01:57:09.789
THEY CAN'T MAKE A CALL- AND BUT

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:13.092
WHAT THEY DO NOW- ARE LIKE THE

01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:15.027
NAMES OF THE- THINGS THAT COME

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:16.396
TO THEM IN THE MAIL EACH MONTH

01:57:16.462 --> 01:57:18.598
ASKING THEM FOR PAYMENT. AND

01:57:18.664 --> 01:57:20.767
WHAT THEY DO NOW IS THE DEVICE

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:22.668
THAT THEY HAVE. AND WHETHER OR

01:57:22.735 --> 01:57:25.071
NOT IT'S WORKING OR NOT AND SO

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:27.039
IT REALLY IS INCUMBENT UPON

01:57:27.106 --> 01:57:29.809
GOVERNMENT- AND WE ARE PART OF

01:57:29.876 --> 01:57:32.512
GOVERNMENT- THE LEGISLATURE. TO

01:57:32.578 --> 01:57:34.514
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO HELP

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.182
TRANSLATE ALL OF THESE

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:39.218
PROBLEMS- IN ISSUES INTO

01:57:39.285 --> 01:57:41.053
SOMETHING THAT THAT FOLKS CAN

01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:43.956
UNDERSTAND- BUT THEN ALSO TO

01:57:44.023 --> 01:57:45.324
HELP CREATE SOLUTIONS AND

01:57:45.391 --> 01:57:47.660
PATHWAYS. THAT MAKE EQUAL

01:57:47.727 --> 01:57:50.096
SENSE- AND SO I SAY THAT

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:52.365
BECAUSE- WHILE SOMETIMES THERE

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:55.435
MAY BE TENSION. BETWEEN ALL OF

01:57:55.501 --> 01:57:57.470
THE PARTIES WE REALLY HAVE AN

01:57:57.537 --> 01:57:59.705
OBLIGATION AND A RESPONSIBILITY

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:02.675
TO WORK TOGETHER- BECAUSE-

01:58:02.742 --> 01:58:06.078
CONNECTIVITY IS. PART OF LIFE

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:08.448
NOW I MEAN YOU WE'VE BECOME

01:58:08.514 --> 01:58:11.417
CODES AND DEVICES- IN ALL OF

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:13.753
THIS AND SO. BEING THAT WE'RE

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:14.654

THE ASSETS THAT WE HAVE WE

01:58:18.324 --> 01:58:20.226
REALLY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:23.196
