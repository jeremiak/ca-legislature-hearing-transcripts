FOR PROSECUTORS TO PURSUE ACTIONS IN THE TWO CASES THAT WERE- THAT I JUST MENTIONED VICTIMS WERE MADE AWARE THEIR CASES DECADES LATER AS A RESULT OF AVAILABLE GENETIC DNA TESTING.

LAW ALLOWS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO INSPECT THE RECORDS OF SOME FIREARM DEALERS AND AMMUNITION VENDORS AYE. BUT NOT ALL. NEW BREED FOR EXAMPLE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE LACKS INSPECTION AUTHORITY OVER VENDORS WHO HOLDS FEDERAL FIREARM LICENSES BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN CALIFORNIA LICENSES CLOSING THIS LOOPHOLE IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT ALL FIREARMS. AND AMMUNITION VENDORS CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABIDING BY THE SAME RULES I HAVE WITH ME TODAY ASHLEY IRIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU TERRY MY NAME IS ASHLEY YEARS APART ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC PART BUT JUSTICE.

THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING REBEKAH MARKETS REPRESENTING BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GORE WATCH ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOING TWICE. OKAY I. JUST WANNA MAKE SURE OF. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MUST COME UNDER THE OF BECOME WATER NOW. THANK YOU FOR- THIS BILL I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ACTUALLY ONE IS- NONCOMPLIANCE A CIVIL PENALTY OR CRIME. AND THE SECOND. QUESTION AS NOTICE REQUIRED OR DOES DEALER STATUS IMPLIED CONSENT. SO IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF VIOLATION SO SOME VIOLATIONS CAN BE A CIVIL FINE BUT SOME DO RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A MISDEMEANOR. OR. SEVEN THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS SOME ARE INFRACTION SOMEWHERE MISDEMEANORS SUMMER FELONY IT DEPENDS ON THE SEVERITY OF THE TYPE OF OFFENSE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF. THE OFFENSE- IN TERMS OF DEALERS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT ARE FREQUENTLY COMES UP IN TERMS OF VIOLATIONS IS SIGNAGE. SO THE LAWS IN THE STATE OF ALIFORNIA REGARDING FIREARMS FREQUENTLY CHECK JUST AND DEAL ARE FREQUENTLY REQUIRED TO UPDATE THEIR SIGNAGE IF THE TIME OF INSPECTION THEY HAVEN'T UPDATED THEIR SIGNAGE TO MATCH THE LAWS EXACTLY. IT IS TECHNICALLY AN INFRACTION. AND THE SECOND QUESTION IF THERE IS A NOTICE REQUIREMENT AT THERE IS NOT. SO DO YOU RECESSES. DO AND THE ANSWER THE FIRST QUESTION THAT THERE IS NOT A NOTICE REQUIREMENT I DO NOT KNOW THAT IMPLIES CONSENT BUT I CAN GET THAT. ANSWER TO YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MUSLIM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WE'RE REALLY CLOSE TO GETTING QUORUM SINCE WE DO- HOOK WILL MOVE THIS SAID THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE AND WE NEED ONE MORE MEMBER TO GET THERE. SO THANK YOU FOR COMING DOWN THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

IT'S SET COLLEGES DR YOU MAY BEGIN MISS POWER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN ON BEHALF THAT HALF OF THE FAMILY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH THIS MORNING. AND THANK YOU. FOR THAT I'M AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN ESTABLISH THE NARROW AMNESTY CLAUSE TO ENCOURAGE VICTIMS AND WITNESSES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TO TESTIFY IN COURT. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL PROVIDES IMMUNITY TO THESE VICTIMS AS WITNESSES FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALCOHOL OR DRUG USE AT THE TIME OF VICTIMIZATION. SEXUAL THE SPLIT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER REPORTED CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT 25% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCE SEXUAL. INCLUDING RAPE DURING THE LIFETIME. STUDIES ALSO S. THAT HAVE OF VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULTS WERE CONSUMING ALCOHOL AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. FEAR OF LIABILITY FOR THIS ILLEGAL CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUGS CAN KEEP VICTIMS REPORTING SEXUAL ASSAULT. MULTIPLE REPORTS INCLUDING REPORT BY THE WHITE HOUSE TASK FORCE ON PROTECTING STUDENTS FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT. CONFIRM THAT AN AMNESTY CLAUSE CAN IMPROVE REPORTING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS NATIONWIDE INCLUDING THE UC HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED AMNESTY CAUSES THE PROVIDE IMMUNITY FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF DRUG OR ALCOHOL USE TO ENCOURAGE REPORTING. AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SEEKS TO EXTEND THE SAM'S ACOSTA ALL SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AND WITNESSES IN CALIFORNIA. AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN WOULD SIMPLY FOR THE TESTIMONY OF THE VICTIM OR WITNESS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ROUTED TO THE EAGER LEGAL USE OF DRUGS AND A- CALL FROM BEING USED AGAINST THEM IN THIS. ACT SECURE SCHECK. RIVAS THERE'S TO COME FORWARD. AS BEING LIABLE FOR PROVIDE OF UNDERAGE DRINKING OR USE. WRITING TENS OF. OAKLAWN FOR. CUTE THIS ASSAULT IN PUBLIC THE OVERALL. AND HERE TO WITH ME OUR PATCH ASPEN IS DEPUTY DISTRICT ON HOW OF THE SAN DIEGO JUST ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND HOUGH TALLINN LAWYER IS STUDENT DC SANTA BARBARA AND A BOARD MEMBER OF STUDENTS AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT. WANNA MAKE SURE- WITH BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER JESSE GABRIEL WHO'S HERE SUBSTITUTION FOR MR QUIRK. WELL YOU MAY BEGIN. OKAY GOOD MORNING WHAT'S YOUR FIRST WISH WOULD BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES MY NAME IS PATRICK ASPEN KNOWS I AM AT THE PGA TO SEND YOU COUNTY DA'S OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF OUR SEX CRIMES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING DIVISION I'M HERE TO I IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN THE IDEA BEHIND THIS LEGISLATION IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT TREAT SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS IT'S CRIMINALS. WHEN BUT THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION IS. PROMOTE NOT ONLY PARTICIPATION THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT ALSO TO ENCOURAGE VICTIMS. OF SEXUAL ASSAULT TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT THE CRIME THIS IS AN OFTEN. UNDER REPORTED CRIME CRIMES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WE KNOW THAT. THE PLAYERS INVOLVED WITH THE PERPETRATORS THE WITNESSES AND THE VICTIMS OFTENTIMES THEIR- DRUG USE OF PERHAPS ALCOHOL USE IT'S AROUND- THE- COMMISSION THOSE OFFENSES. THIS LEGISLATION IS DESIGNED. TO PROVIDE WHAT WE CALL AMNESTY. FOR OR IF USE IMMUNITY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS BOTH WITNESSES AND VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY TO PARTICIPATE IN. THE UNDERLYING PROCEEDINGS OF. THE SEXUAL. CASE WHAT WE SEE CURRENTLY IS THAT OFTEN TIMES THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY. AND FEAR ABOUT COMING FORWARD BECAUSE THE IDEA IS. WITNESSES AND VICTIMS KNOW THAT WHEN THEY TESTIFY IN THE UNDERLYING SEXUAL ASSAULT. THE KITCHEN. LIKELY TO BE ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT DRUG USE. OR UNDER AGE ALCOHOL USE. AND THE IDEA IS THOSE TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY TRUTHFUL ANSWERS QUESTION. MAY INCRIMINATE HIMSELF. WHAT THIS BILL. YES WITNESS IT GOOD SAMARITAN WOULDN'T THIS AS WELL AS VICTIMS THOSE THAT. BUT BY A SURE THEM THAT THAT TO PROTEST WILL NOT BE USED AGAINST THEM IN THE IN SOME FUTURE PROSECUTION CURRENTLY THERE IS THAT A PROVISION THAT PROVIDES IMMUNITY TO WITNESSES IN THE SITUATION. HOWEVER IT'S IN PERFECT IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SITUATION BECAUSE- WHAT WOULD REQUIRE THE TRIAL JUST TO DO IS CALL A TIME OUT IN DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO ADVISE. THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT IN THAT WAY TREATS THEM LIKE LIKE A CRIMINAL SO WE WOULD ASK THAT SUPPORT VILLAGE FOR THIS LEGISLATION WE WOULD URGE AND I FELT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS TELLING WHERE AND I MEAN YOU SEE. STUDENT AT. BOTH THE VICE DIRECTOR STUDENTS CAN SEXUAL ASSAULT AND AS AN ADVOCATE FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. SO THE JUSTICE LAST MONTH SAYS TO MEMBERS LAUNCHED A SEXUAL ASSAULT CAMPUS CLIMATE SURVEY. ON THE UCSD CAMPUS IN JUST ONE WEEK RETAIN ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTEEN RESPONSES FROM STUDENTS. AND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE RESPONDENTS STATED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. MORE THAN HALF OF THESE MEMBERS OR RESPONDENTS WERE FRESHMEN OR SOPHOMORES. AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY STATED THEY'D VOLUNTARILY CONSUMED ALCOHOL OR RECREATIONAL DRUGS PRIOR TO THE ASSAULT. EVERY DAY WE GET MORE RESPONSES IN EVERY DAY THESE NUMBERS INCREASE. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE THE PEOPLE AROUND ME MY COLLEGE COMMUNITY MY BEST FRIEND'S MY SORORITY SISTERS MY CO WORKERS. EVEN I'VE EXPERIENCED PEOPLE THINKING THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO MY BODY WITHOUT MY CONSENT AFTER I'VE USED ALCOHOL AS A MINOR. IN ONE OF THESE EXPERIENCES THE PERPETRATOR USED FOR PHYSICAL FORCE AND THOUGHT IT WAS AN EASY TARGET BECAUSE I'D CONSUMED ALCOHOL. I NEVER REPORTED THESE EXPERIENCES BECAUSE I WAS SCARED OF REPRISAL ENABLING MYSELF. WHEN A SURVIVOR REPORTS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ARE ASKED IS WHETHER ALCOHOL DRUGS WERE INVOLVED. NOT ONLY DOES THIS INVALIDATE THE SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE BUT ALSO PRODUCES A BARRIER AND DISCOMFORT IN REPORTING. A SURVIVOR SHOULD NEVER BE IN A POSITION WHERE FEAR RETALIATION DISCOURAGES THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ALLOWING SURVIVORS TESTIMONY OF UNLAWFULLY CONSUMING ALCOHOL AND- RECREATIONAL DRUGS TO BE USED IN CRIMINAL PROCEDURES AGAINST THEM TO PUT TO A- VOTE AGAINST THEM IS CONTRARY AND CONTRADICTORY TO THE MISSION OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHEN THAT AIM TO PROTECT SURVIVORS AND PENALIZE PERPETRATORS WHO COMMIT THESE VULGAR OFFENSES. WE ARE THE SYSTEM ARE FAILING SURVIVORS BY PRODUCING AN UNSAFE AND INTIMIDATING REPORTING PROCESS AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN IS NECESSARY AND ENSURING SURVIVORS RATES ARE UP HELD. AND THAT SURVIVORS CANNOT BE UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED FOR REPORTING THEIR EXPERIENCE THANK. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE- CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS. ASSOCIATION SEXUAL ASSAULTS ARE ONE OF THE CATEGORIES OF CRIMES THAT TAKE PLACE AYE DISPROPORTIONATELY I'M SORRY SO LEVEL IS ALL RIGHT NAME AN ORGANIZATION STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL GOOD SENSE BILL. THANK YOU. MORE ENGLISH GERMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE- CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SPONSOR AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MICHELLE THOMAS SHOP REPRESENTING ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NEEDS YOUR MOLLY WERE ALSO CO SPONSORS OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE JOHN FAMILY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION AGAINST SEXUAL ASSAULT SPEAKING IN FULL SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING THIS ENABLES OTHERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY AND WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI GOOD MORNING. GOOD. THE. MARGOT GEORGE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION OF FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE OF FOR THE AMENDMENT TO A. B. NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN ACTING AT TO FELONIES ONLY UNFORTUNATELY WILL MISS STILL OPPOSE- THIS BILL UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO PROTECT THE CONST THE CONSTITUTION THAT'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE AND CONFRONT. AND FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT STOP RAPE CULTURE AND SECONDLY. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION DOESN'T THINK THAT ANYONE SHOULD BE PROSECUTED FOR ALCOHOL AND DRUG OFFENSES SO WE'RE NOT AGAINST EXPANDING THE PROTECTION OF NO PROSECUTION WHAT WE ARE AGAINST. IS THE USE OF THE COMPELLED TESTIMONY WITHOUT THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO CROSS AMENDMENT WE'RE ASKING FOR WOULD SAY THAT THIS- LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY WOULD NOT LIMIT. QUESTIONING BY THE DEFENDANT OF THE VICTIM OR THE WITNESS- AND FOR THE MORE THAT THE IMMUNITY- WOULD BE ADMISSIBLE TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT ANY OTHER GRANT OF IMMUNITY WOULD BE. UNDER EXISTING LAW. A WITNESS CAN BE CROSS EXAMINED ABOUT ANY GRANT OF IMMUNITY WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A GRANT THAT COMES- THROUGH THE COURT PROCEDURE. THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY DESCRIBED OR IF IT'S JUST AN ORAL PROMISE BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR THE POLICE THAT THE PERSON WILL NOT BE PROSECUTED AND THAT IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY UP HELD BY BOTH FEDERAL IN CALIFORNIA COURTS. IN FACT IT'S REVERSIBLE ERROR NOT TO READ ALOUD THE DEFENDANT CROSS EXAMINE THE WITNESS ABOUT ANY BARGAIN THEY'VE MADE WITH THE GOVERNMENT. AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SEEKS TO SHIELD THE VICTIM OR WITNESS FROM THAT CROSS EXAMINATION BY MAKING IT A LEGISLATIVE GRANT OF IMMUNITY AND THAT'S NOTA VERY BROAD GRANT OF IMMUNITY IT'S ONLY FOR THEIR TESTIMONY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY CAN AN- CURRENTLY STILL WISHES TO HAVE UP THE THREAT OF PROSECUTION HOLDING OVER THE WITNESS TO COMPEL. THEIR COOPERATION AND TESTIMONY BY THREATENING TO PROSECUTE THEM FOR EITHER THE DRUG OR ALCOHOL OFFENSE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ABROGATING THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE. UNDER EXISTING LAW PROSECUTORS CAN ALREADY TELL THE VICTIM OR WITNESS DON'T WORRY WE'RE NOT GOING TO PROSECUTE YOU FOR THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO FILE CHARGES. AND IF THEY DO FILE CHARGES THEN THEY CAN- ASKS FOR STATUTORY GRANT OF IMMUNITY IT IS NOT SOMETHING THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND ASK OR STATUTORY GRANT OF IMMUNITY FOR DEFENSE WITNESS. SO BASICALLY THE AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN SIX TO ABROGATE THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE. BY CLICKING THE PROSECUTION WITNESS IN THIS LEGISLATIVE IMMUNITY WHILE ALLOWING THE PROSECUTOR TO COMPEL THE WITNESSES COOPERATION. FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE AND LESS IT' AMENDED TO PROTECT THE DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO CROSS EXAMINE THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MORNING MR CHAIR MEMBERS MIGHT THE DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL- AND APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING OUR LETTER IN LATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OF BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF ANY QUESTIONS. MISS COLORADO KAMLAGER SO I WANT TO THANK YOU MISS. MAYOR HORVATH GLASS BRING HER QUE AND- OUR CAN FOR- REPRESENTING OUR GOOD FRIEND- FROM ANTHONY THIS I UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW- BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY- BOTH THE ACLU. AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION- SEXUAL ASSAULT IS VERY REAL ON CAMPUSES I THINK ANYONE WHO'S SEEN THE MOVIE THE HUNTING GROUND KNOWS. THAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES NEED TO UP THEIR GAME WITH REGARDS TO POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND ENFORCEMENT AND RECOGNIZE THE BOX THAT IS IN HERE IN A LOT OF- CAMPUS CULTURE MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE REVENUE THAT'S GENERATED FROM SO MANY OF OUR- A PROGRAMS THAT ARE ON- THOSE CAMPUSES. AND FOCUSING TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM HAVING SAID THAT I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN THE CAMPUS CULTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS THROUGH OUR PENAL CODE YOU KNOW I REALLY SEE THIS AS A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND UNNECESSARY BECAUSE. YOUR DISPOSAL YOU HAVE PENAL CODE TWO TWENTY YOU HAVE PENAL CODE. TWO SIXTY ONE TWO EIGHTY NINE TWO FORTY THREE- YOU ALREADY HAVE DISCRETION TO OFFER IMMUNITY IF YOU WANT AND SO TO YOUR POINT YOU SAID YOU YOU YOU DON'T NEED TO AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE REATING SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS AS CRIMINALS. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ANYWAY THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LACK OF LAW IT HAS A LOT MORE TO DO WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT CULTURE AND HOW YOU TREAT FOLKS TO COME FORWARD- THERE IS A CHALLENGE THAT I SEE RIGHT NOW AND MAYBE THEY CAN GET AMENDED. AROUND EXCLUDING EVIDENCE MY MIND I DON'T SEE HOW THIS DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE PROSECUTOR AFFIRMATIVE DUTY PER BRADY. AND WHEN YOU'RE LOWERING THE BAR FOR CONVICTION YOU'RE ALSO LOWERING THE BAR FOR DUE PROCESS I HAVE SOME VERY REAL QUICK. ABOUT HOW MUCH. I INTOXICANT INTERLACED WITH THE EVENT I THINK IS VERY REAL SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE SUBSTANCES ARE CONSENSUALLY SHARED HOW DO YOU PROCEED WHEN A VICTIM HAS PRIORS WHAT IF THE VICTIM HAS SUPPLIED THE DRUGS. IS THE TYPE OR AMOUNT OF SUBSTANCE DOES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THIS SCENARIO I WOULD ARGUE THAT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN SUPPLYING. YOU KNOW FENTANYL TONS AND TONS OF SENTINEL WHICH IS KILLING PEOPLE. THAT ACTUALLY IS VERY REAL IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN THE IMMUNITY THAT YOU COULD OFFER FOR THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE AT YOUR DISPOSAL- BUT IT PROVIDES US A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE. TWO EXCLUDING EVIDENCE AND THEN HOW IS THAT SHARED IN TERMS OF JURY DESCRIBE DISK INSTRUCTIONS ARE YOU THEN MAKING SURE THAT YOU'RE TELLING THAT TO THE JURY WE ARE EXCLUDING ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE THAT COULD BE RELEVANT. SO I WANT TO SUPPORT THE WOMEN AND THE MEN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON CAMPUS I WANT TO SUPPORT. MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED YOU KNOW IN THE WORLD AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE THE TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL THROUGH A NUMBER OF SECTIONS IN THE PENAL CODE. TO DO THAT- AND SO WITH THAT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY RESERVATIONS AND CONCERNS AND HOPE THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS WHEN IT COMES TO THE FLOOR IF THERE AMENDMENTS ARE- YOU KNOW ADOPTED. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO CHAIR AND.OF. BUT I KNOW ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE QUESTIONS AND BEFORE I. AND I KNOW OF THE AUTHORS NOT THERE AND AT NIGHT HERE OB DID. DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT RIGHT NOW OR HAVE SOME OF THE WITNESSES IMPRESSIVE HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO HANDLE YES I'D LOVE TO TURN OVER TO THE WITNESS TO ANSWER SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS. A PARENT THEIR QUESTIONS. EIGHT SHOULD YES THIRTY CHAIR THANK YOU TALK TO HIM. AND I WROTE DOWN THE NUMBER CONCERNS I'M HAPPY TO DROP ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WAS THE NOTION THAT THIS BILL EXCLUDES EVIDENCE AND LET ME BE CLEAR THERE IS USE IMMUNITY AND THEN THERE'S TRANSACTIONAL BUT LET ME. SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION BUT EXCLUDING EVIDENCE IN THE UNDERLYING. SEXUAL ASSAULT PROSECUTION. THE USE OF ALCOHOL BY THE COMPLAINING WITNESS BY THE VICTIM FOR OR ILLEGAL DRUGS THAT WOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED THE BILL DOES NOT IMPACT THAT AT ALL WHAT HAPPENS IS THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY. FOR THE ACCUSED WOULD BE ABLE TO CROSS EXAMINE THE VICTIM AND ASK THOSE QUESTIONS ELICIT THAT EVIDENCE SO THAT THE JURY COULD HEAR THE FACT FINDER COULD HURT HERE THE ONLY LIMITATION ON ADMISSIBILITY. OF EVIDENCE WOULD BE IF. THAT VICTIM OR THAT TESTIFYING WITNESS WAS GOING TO BE PROSECUTED AGAIN IN A SEPARATE CASE. FOR USE OF ALCOHOL FOR POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL FOR USE OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE FOR MAP POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. THEN IN THAT STEP CASE THE TESTIMONY THAT THE VICTIM WHAT THE WITNESS GAVE AND THE UNDERLYING SEX CRIMES CASE THAT TESTIMONY COULD NOT BE USED TO BUILD A PROSECUTION IN A SEPARATE CASE. AGAINST THAT VICTIM WE'RE GOOD SAMARITAN WITNESS YOU CAME FOR SO I THINK THERE'S A MIS UNDERSTANDING OF. THE ADMISSIBILITY HOW MUCH LIMIT IT'S LIMITED- ONLY IN THE EVENT OF A FUTURE PROSECUTION SO I THINK THAT ADDRESSES ONE CONCERN IS THAT THE A SIMPLE PERSON MAY HAVE RAISED. CONCERNS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION WELL. THERE HAS TO BE IN ON THE ENDING OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN USE IMMUNITY. ENTRANCE CHANNEL ME. TRêN. I WHERE. THE THERE'S A NEW GIVEN FOR THE- PROCESS. OF THAT. SO IN THE EXAMPLE ASK WHAT ABOUT THAT NO WHAT ABOUT IF A RAPE VICTIM WAS SUPPLYING FAT NOW. AND DURING THE UNDERLYING SEX CRIMES PROSECUTION THAT RAPE VICTIM ADMITTED THAT THERE WAS FAT AND ALL PROVIDED THAT WAS THE SUBJECT OF THE SEXUAL ASSAULT. WELL IN THAT CASE. ONLY IF LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS TO INDEPENDENT BE ABLE TO BUILD A CASE AGAINST VICTIM FOR FAT NO USE OR- OR SALES OR IN SOME WAY. THAT PROSECUTION COULD GO FORWARD ALL THIS LEGISLATION SAYS IS IN THE EVENT WHEN YOU'RE PROSECUTING THE SEX CRIMES. IF THE TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY FROM THAT DATA MORE YES- AN- IMAGE USE OF THAT IN ALL OR WHATEVER LSD OR METHAMPHETAMINE. YOU CANNOT USE THAT TESTIMONY IN THE SEXUAL ASSAULT PROSECUTION FOR SOME SET A SUBSEQUENT FEDERAL PROSECUTION SO I THINK. THAT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENTRY EXACT. A I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS AND HOPEFULLY OUR ALLIED. THERE WAS THIS OTHER REFERENCE WELL THE PROSECUTION HAS PLENTY OF THOSE THEY CAN PROMISE THE WITNESS. THEY'RE. NOT GONNA BE PROCESS. FOR DRUG USE WELL WE HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM THE THAT IS A CONCEPT OF HIP IMMUNITY IDEA THAT THE DA IS ENGAGING IN SECRET DEALS WITH THE AT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ENGAGING IN SECRET DEALS WITH THE WITNESS. THAT DES NOT HAPPEN WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT WE HAVE A FORMAL PROCESS SO THAT EVERYTHING IS TRANSPARENT AND SO THIS THIS NOTION OF THE PA COULD USE. INFORMAL PROMISES PROMISES AND HIP POCKET IMMUNITY THAT WOULD BE- ANATHEMA TO A PROSECUTOR IN THE MODERN DAY THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULDN'T DO THAT IS SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. GOING IN TELLING WITNESSES. PRIVATELY HEY DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT YOU'RE NOT BE PROSECUTED FOR YOUR DRUG USE OF. ALCOHOL USE AND SO THERE IS A MOVEMENT AWAY FROM THAT. IN FACT THE ONLY FORMAL PROCESSES IN THIRTEEN TWENTY FOUR OF THE PENAL CODE. WHAT THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE TO COMPEL THE WITNESS TO TESTIFY THE REASON WHY THIS IS PROBLEMATIC IN A SEX CRIMES PROSECUTION IS BECAUSE OF PENAL CODE SECTION SIX EIGHTY POINT TWO. IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SIX EIGHTY POINT TWO. SIXTEEN POINT TWO SAYS. THAT POLICE OFFICERS AND NURSES WHEN THEY FIRST COME IN CONTACT WITH A SEX CRIME VICTIM HAVE TO GIVE A CARD WITH ALL THEIR LEGAL RIGHTS. ONE OF THOSE LEGAL RIGHTS IS. THAT A YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE- PROCESS. THAT IS INCONSISTENT WITH MY VICTIM LESS POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY WAS IN THE PROCESS AND HAS TO GO TO. THE TWENTY FOUR MINUTE PROCESS. THE ONLY WAY TO FORMALLY PROVIDE NEARLY AS WITH A- COMPACT AND THE TYPE OF TESTIFIED IN SO THAT'S VERY INCONSISTENT. WITH THE RIGHTS THAT HE- GIVE OUR VICTIMS INTO THE SIX EIGHTY TWO POINT CAR POINT TWO CARD. THAT DOES THAT WAS- THE STATE POLICY AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO I HOPE I ADDRESSED ALL OF THE CONCERNS IF THERE WAS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I DIDN'T I CERTAINLY HAVE RESPONSE THEM I KNOW THEY WERE COMING COMING FAST AND FURIOUS THE CHAIR HAS ANY FURTHER CONCERNS. AT PRESENT I. DO THAT. AND MEASURE BY TAKE THAT AGE YOU'RE CLOSING OR PARTY OR THE FOUR DIGIT WHERE THERE THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS ON YOUR- I WAS. NOT DISS HER THIS IS PART OF THE CLOSING RIGHT THE CLOTHING. I AM SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE WITH AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S THAT THIS ONE STOP RAPE CULTURE I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK THE PROPONENTS ARE AT SAYING IT WELL BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES MANY OF WHICH- MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND WE KNOW WHAT THIS. IS NO THE THING WOMEN A SENSE THAT THEY WILL BE SAFE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MAKE AND THEY'RE NOT COMPLETELY SAFE IF THEY'VE BEEN A WRONGDOER IN OTHER WAYS BUT THE SMALL PIECE OF SECURITY WILL HOPEFULLY. CHANGE THAT CALL IN SMALLEST. BIT SO THAT MORE VICTIMS WILL COME FORWARD AND FEEL SAFE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH THAT I WILL ASK YOU FOR YOUR EITHER. IN THE CHAIRS. RECOMMENDED I. IS REALLY BASED ON. THE OFFICE- I REALLY DO BELIEVE TE AUTHOR. WILL WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION. ON THE NIGHT IN OPPOSITION YOUR- YOUR- I WILL SAY I. A LESS I MEANT IT- IF WE CAN GET TO THAT SWEET SPOT- WHICH I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE CAN- WITH FURTHER DIALOGUE BECAUSE IT'S A- IT'S A IT'S A LOT. AND AT AND IF WE CAN GET THROUGH WHERE WHICH OF I THINK WE ALL WANT TO GET TO THE SAME PLACE. ON BOTH SIDES AND IF WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO THAT TARGET. INSTEAD OF MAYBE. DISCUSSING THAT MY WAY VERSUS YOUR WAY BUT WE AL WANT TO MAKE SURE. PEOPLE ARE SAFE ON CAMPUSES AND- RAPE VICTIMS- THE BEST WE CAN GET WE CAN PROTECT THEM. AND SO AS CHAIR RECOMMENDED AND I VOTE WE HAD A MOTION AND A SECOND. THEY CALL THE ROLL. I'M AB NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER HI JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. BARRICADE HAN BARRICADE HAND I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER. KAMLAGER NOT VOTING. GABRIEL GABRIEL AYE SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE WICKS.
