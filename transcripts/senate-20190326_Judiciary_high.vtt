00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.699
AFRICAN PEOPLE -- AND THAT IS

00:21:07.766 --> 00:21:09.534
WHERE IN OUR HAIR IS MORE THAN A

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.203
HAIRSTYLE IT ACTUALLY DENOTES

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:13.271
WHO WE ARE IN AFRICA TO NOTABLE

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:14.640
TRIBES WE'RE FROM.

00:21:14.706 --> 00:21:16.041
IT'S NOT A WHOLE WHAT KIND OF

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.943
JOB WE HAVE WHAT KIND OF FAMILY

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.112
WERE FROM SO IT HAS NOT CHANGED

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:21.647
THAT IS ONE THING ABOUT OUR

00:21:21.713 --> 00:21:22.514
CULTURE.

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:24.082
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SURVIVE

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.151
THROUGH THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS

00:21:26.218 --> 00:21:27.252
OF OPPRESSION AND BEING

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:29.488
SUBJECTED TO WHITE SUPREMACY AS

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.356
WELL AS EURO CENTRIC STANDARDS

00:21:31.423 --> 00:21:31.957
OF BEAUTY.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:33.892
SO BEING ABLE TO WEAR OUR HAIR

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:35.127
NATURAL IS IMPORTANT.

00:21:35.193 --> 00:21:37.129
I DEAL WITH THIS EVERY SINGLE

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.231
DAY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVING

00:21:39.297 --> 00:21:40.799
OTHER HAIR DONE NATURAL -- A

00:21:40.866 --> 00:21:43.301
COSMETOLOGIST BY TRADE AS WELL

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:45.237
AS A LOT TUITION UNLOCKED AS IN

00:21:45.303 --> 00:21:47.839
THE SOMEONE WHO LOCKS OR TWISTS

00:21:47.906 --> 00:21:49.541
OR BRAIDS NATURAL HAIR.

00:21:49.608 --> 00:21:51.243
AND IT'S WONDERFUL FOR PEOPLE IS

00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:52.778
MORE THAN WHEN THEY COME IN TO

00:21:52.844 --> 00:21:54.379
GET THEIR HAIR LOT THEY NOT ONLY

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.148
DO PART WORRY ABOUT THEM NOT

00:21:56.214 --> 00:21:57.482
ONLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE HERE

00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:58.517
IS GOING TO DO.

00:21:58.583 --> 00:22:00.786
NATURALLY BUT IT ENDS UP

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:02.521
INTERNALLY IT TURNS ON SOMETHING

00:22:02.587 --> 00:22:03.355
IN THEM.

00:22:03.422 --> 00:22:05.023
AND THAT ACTUALLY GETS THEM TO

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:07.592
INTERNAL Là INTERNALLY -- FIND

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.061

IS JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT --

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.140
IT'S BEEN A PRACTICE BUT IT'S

00:22:22.207 --> 00:22:23.742
NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:25.010
BE SUBJECTED.

SEPARATES RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION

00:27:39.791 --> 00:27:42.360
OR RELIGIOUS IDENTITY FROM RACE.

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:44.095

OF THE FACT THAT IT'S NOW LEGAL

00:42:31.515 --> 00:42:33.317
IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS NOT THE

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:34.084
BOOGIE MAN.

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.419

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:37.721
WE LOOK AT IT IN THAT WAY

00:42:37.788 --> 00:42:39.390

MONNING TO GO GO FOR WITH HIS

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:55.806
QUESTIONS -- IT'S MY

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:57.308
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE FDA

00:42:57.374 --> 00:42:59.677
APPROVED A DRUG DERIVED FROM

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.912
CANNABIS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TO

00:43:01.979 --> 00:43:04.381
SEVERE FORMS OF EPILEPSY AFTER

00:43:04.448 --> 00:43:06.050
LAST YEAR'S BILL PASSED OUT OF

00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:07.751
THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M WONDERING.

00:43:07.818 --> 00:43:11.121
IF THAT MEDICATION IS NOW

00:43:11.188 --> 00:43:13.123
AVAILABLE TO CHILDREN.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.792
IS IT IS IT IS IT IS IT'S IN A

00:43:14.858 --> 00:43:18.028
SYNTHETIC FORM IT'S NOT.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.964
OF THE LAND LIKE THE TEACHERS

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:21.532
THAT WE PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:24.668
WITH -- WITH SYNTHETIC FORM COME

00:43:24.735 --> 00:43:26.437
SIDE EFFECTS.

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:29.640
AND THEY I'LL YOU KNOW THE RISK

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:30.975
IS JUST TOO HIGH.

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.943
I BELIEVE MY PERSONAL OPINION I

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:36.380
WOULD NOT USE THT MEDICINE FOR

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:39.083
MY CHILD.

00:43:39.149 --> 00:43:40.985
ALL RIGHT AND I APPRECIATE THAT

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.720
BECAUSE AGAIN.

00:43:42.786 --> 00:43:44.888
THE C. B. D. IN THE OILS AND THE

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:46.357
CREAMS ARE JUST NOT.

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:48.759
GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:49.860
THEY JUST DON'T PENALIZE YOU

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:51.628
CAN'T YOU DON'T INHALE IT SO YOU

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:52.796
DON'T HAVE TO BE DOWN WIND AND

00:43:52.863 --> 00:43:55.499
WORRY ABOUT GETTING A HI THIS IS

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:57.134

IS KIND OF A SHOCKING BUT LAST

00:44:03.741 --> 00:44:05.976
QUESTION I HAVE IS -- WHAT OTHER

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:07.978
ILLNESSES OR OR ARE YOU AWARE OF

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:10.414

CANNABIS ARE THERE OTHERS A

00:44:13.951 --> 00:44:14.718
COULD YOU KIND OF GIVE US AN

00:44:14.785 --> 00:44:16.320
IDEA BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:18.122

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:21.325
HELPFUL.

00:44:21.392 --> 00:44:22.993
IN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES SO IF YOU

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.294
COULD ENLIGHTEN US A LITTLE BIT

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:26.530
ON THAT THAT WOULD BE

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.365
APPRECIATED.

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:29.733
UP WILL LIKE CANCER DEFINITELY

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.702
THE SIDE EFFECTS AND THE

00:44:31.769 --> 00:44:33.537
DEBILITATING THINGS THAT IT

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:36.774

ELEMENTS CROHN'S DISEASE -- IT

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:45.616
MEDICATION.

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:48.052
SO ANYTHING LIKE MS THAT'S

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:50.687
ANOTHER -- DEBILITATING DISEASE

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:54.892

THERE WERE THERE ANY OTHER SOME

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:02.946
FEDERALISM IN THERE SOME ISSUES

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:05.415
WHERE THE SCHOOL I'M DISTRICTS

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:07.384
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT -- THIS IS

00:48:07.451 --> 00:48:08.218
STILL ILLEGAL AT THE FEDERAL

00:48:08.285 --> 00:48:08.852
LEVEL IN THERE SOME CHALLENGES

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:12.289
THERE -- BUT THIS DOES REQUIRE

00:48:12.356 --> 00:48:13.257
THAT THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS THAT

00:48:13.323 --> 00:48:15.259

LOCALLY AND ITS LOCAL

00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:20.864
ACCOUNTABLE WHAT I IT WAS

00:48:20.931 --> 00:48:22.933
UNCLEAR ABOUT I WAS READING --

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.401
THE GOVERNOR'S VETO SO THAT IT

00:48:24.468 --> 00:48:26.503
SAYS THAT THE GOVERNOR OF COURSE

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.971
WE ALL KNOW THE GOVERNOR VETOED.

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.439
THE BILL IN A PRESIDENTE CALLED

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.775
WHAT YOU PROPOSED.

00:48:31.842 --> 00:48:32.643
AND HE SAYS.

00:48:32.709 --> 00:48:33.277
THIS BILL IS OVERLY BROAD AS IT

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:34.111
APPLIES TO ALL STUDENTS INSTEAD

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:34.945
OF LIMITED CASES WHERE DOCTOR

00:48:35.012 --> 00:48:36.947
RECOMMENDS MEDICAL MARIJUANA FOR

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:38.949
STUDENT ORDER. TO PREVENT.

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:40.651
OR REDUCE THE SIDE EFFECTS OF A

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:44.454
SEIZURE -- BUT IT IS NOT ALL

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:46.490
STUDENTS ARE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:47.991
CHILD YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MEDICAL

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.993
CANNABIS RECOMMENDATION ON FILE.

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.963
FOR IT TO BE.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.197
EVEN BY THE DIRECTION -- INTO A

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:56.400
THINK WHAT HE WAS REFERRING TO

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.535
IS IT APPLIES TO ALL STUDENTS

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:59.836
THAT HAVE MEDICAL

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:01.805
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM PHYSICIANS

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.106
SO IT WOULD BE.

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:05.375
EXPANDING THE USE I I I BELIEVE

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.943
HE WAS MORE INTERESTED IN

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.646
FOCUSING ON EPILEPSY HAS A

00:49:09.713 --> 00:49:12.115
PARTICULAR AILMENT BUT WHAT HE

00:49:12.182 --> 00:49:12.949
WAS DOING IN THAT.

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:14.851
YOU KNOW MESSAGES HE'S ACTUALLY

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:16.453
IS STATING SOMETHING THAT WOULD

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.388
BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE BECAUSE

00:49:18.455 --> 00:49:19.056
IF YOU.

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:20.557
ARE ONLY GETTING MEDICAL

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.125
CANNABIS IN THE SCHOOL THAN YOU

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:23.026
HAVE.

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:25.529
IDENTIFIED A PARTICULAR AILMENT

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:27.297
WTH THAT PARTICULAR STUDENT AS

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:28.765
HAVING THAT EPILEPSY WHICH IS IN

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:30.267
VIOLATION OF HIP -- IF THAT

00:49:30.334 --> 00:49:33.136
BECOMES A PART OF THE THE RECORD

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:34.237
OR THE SCHOOL IS USING THAT

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:37.774
INFORMATION SO I THINK HAT WAS

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.876
KIND OF A WRONG DIRECTION. TO TO

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:44.548
BE GOING AND NOT PARTICULARLY A

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:45.582
LEGAL ONE AT THAT.

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.783
WITH THAT IT THAT HAS BEEN THAT

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:48.051
THE PRIVACY ISSUES THE HIP

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:48.618
ISSUES ARE STILL SOMETHING I

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:49.653
KNOW THAT WE WORKED ON LAST YEAR

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.590
ON THIS AND AGAIN -- INTO

00:49:53.657 --> 00:49:54.891
ASTONISHING TO ME THAT WE TALK

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:57.127
TALK TALK ABOUT THIS IS SOME.

00:49:57.194 --> 00:49:59.629
KIND OF ARCANE MEDICAL.

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.165
CREATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.667
A PRODUCT THAT I THINK A LOT OF

00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:04.835
PEOPLE USE I KNOW A LOT OF

00:50:04.901 --> 00:50:07.237
PEOPLE USES FOR ARTHRITIS.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.805
I HAVE YET TO SEE THEM.

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:12.242
RUN AROUND ON THE CEILINGS AND

00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:14.444
BE KIND OF CRAZY.

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.313
HI THAT'S A DIFFERENT A VERY

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:18.048
DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE I SUSPECT

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.716
BUT CERTAINLY THE THE THE

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.451
MEDICAL PART OF THIS IS VERY

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:25.055
DIFFERENT AND SO -- I THINK THAT

00:50:25.122 --> 00:50:26.623
THEY'RE APPLES AND ORANGES BUT

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:28.558
WE BUT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT NOW

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.427
AND WORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS AND

00:50:30.494 --> 00:50:32.195
AGAIN I'M VERY PLEASED TO SEE

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:34.464
THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE.

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:35.799
REALLY WILLING TO COME.

00:50:35.866 --> 00:50:37.667
A STEP UP ON THIS THIS IS NOT

00:50:37.734 --> 00:50:40.670
THIS IS NOT A YOU KNOW A LIFE

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:42.706
THREATENING SITUATION THIS IS

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:45.142
ACTUALLY LIFESAVING AND AND THE

00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:46.543
WAY WE DEALT WITH CANNABIS

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:46.843
[inaudible]

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:50.313
OF THE PAST MANY YEARS HAS JUST

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:52.582
BEEN SO WRONG HEADED CERTAINLY

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.584
CANNABIS OF THIS NATURE SO AND

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:56.787
C. B. D. -- SO.

00:50:56.853 --> 00:50:58.755
I THINK AGAIN THERE ARE THE

00:50:58.822 --> 00:51:00.190
MEDICAL ISSUES SOCIAL GET I

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.625
THINK THEY CAN GET WORKED OUT AS

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.760
WE GO FORWARD BUT THIS FOCUS

00:51:03.827 --> 00:51:05.495
RIGHT HERE IS ON JUST MAKING IT

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:06.196
AVAILABLE.

00:51:06.263 --> 00:51:07.731
SO CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO LOSE

00:51:07.798 --> 00:51:09.733
ALL THESE HOURS OF SCHOOL IF

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.835
THEY IF THIS IS YOU KNOW IF THIS

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.370
CANNABIS RECIBE DEAR WHATEVER

00:51:13.437 --> 00:51:13.904
THAT.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.172
THE PRODUCT IS IS ABLE TO HELP

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:18.608
THESE CHILDREN LEAD NORMAL LIVES.

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:20.477
US SENATOR STERN.

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:23.380
ALL RIGHT THIS GUEST CENTER

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.815
BORDERS.

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.383
WHEN I WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:30.020
IF I IF I WOULD IF I WAS SICK --

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:31.254
MY MY MOTHER WOULD BRING.

00:51:31.321 --> 00:51:33.590
THE ANTIBIOTICS TO SCHOOL AND

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:37.160
THE NURSE -- WOULD FOLLOW THE

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.562
THE REGIMEN AND I'D BE CALLED IN.

00:51:38.628 --> 00:51:40.564
AND WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.867
SCHOOL NURSE -- WHY ISN'T THAT

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.802
AN OPTION IN SOMETHING WITH

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:46.803
SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.438
IT'S A OR IS THAT UNDER THE

00:51:48.505 --> 00:51:50.273
GUARDIAN IS TO GIVE THAT UNDER

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.942
GUARDIAN.

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.109
NO IT WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED UNDER

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:54.845
ANY CIRCUMSTANCE HERE MAINLY THE

00:51:54.911 --> 00:51:56.947
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND SCHOOL

00:51:57.013 --> 00:51:59.950
FACULTY WE'RE VERY CONCERNED.

00:52:00.016 --> 00:52:01.084
THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.285
ADMINISTRATION WHAT WOULD BE A

00:52:02.352 --> 00:52:04.287
CAN CONSIDERED A FEDERALLY --

00:52:04.354 --> 00:52:06.923
ILLEGAL PRODUCT AND THAT ALSO

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:09.092
COULD CALL INTO QUESTION PERHAPS

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:11.261
THE THE FEDERAL FUNDS THAT COME

00:52:11.328 --> 00:52:12.662
TO THOSE SCHOOLS IF THERE WERE

00:52:12.729 --> 00:52:14.064
THAT WERE EVER QUESTION SO.

00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.432
THE EVEN THOUGH THEY DO THAT

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.633
WITH OPIOID TO DO WITH

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:17.901
ANTIBIOTICS AND THEY ADMINISTER

00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.836
THEM TO THE STUDENTS -- BECAUSE

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:21.705
OF THE THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:24.574
OF CANNABIS -- THE WERE

00:52:24.641 --> 00:52:26.543
RELUCTANT AND ALSO I BELIEVE

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.312
BECAUSE THERE ARE EVEN THOUGH

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:31.548
THIS IS AS THE C. B. D. IS THE

00:52:31.615 --> 00:52:32.916
C. B. D. PART.

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:35.519
THERE IS ALWAYS A TRACE AMOUNT A

00:52:35.585 --> 00:52:37.420
GENERALLY OF THC WITHIN THAT

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:38.688
PRODUCT.

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.991
NOT ENOUGH TO CREATE THE

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.926
PSYCHOACTIVE OF FACT BUT THERE

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.794
IS SOME WE IN THAT AND I DON'T

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:46.563
BELIEVE THE THE SCHOOLS WANTED

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:47.631
TO HAVE THAT.

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.232
ON THEIR CAMPUS UNDER ANY

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:50.333
CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN THOUGH THE

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.769
OPIOIDS OF EVERY LEVEL ARE THERE

00:52:52.836 --> 00:52:53.970
BUT IT'S I THINK THERE'S A

00:52:54.037 --> 00:52:58.475
SENSITIVITY THERE AND WE WANTED

00:52:58.542 --> 00:52:59.576
TO RESPECT THAT.

00:52:59.643 --> 00:53:01.111
OUR AND LAST QUESTION.

00:53:01.177 --> 00:53:01.878
THIS IS WHERE I HAVE A TOUGH

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:02.078
TIME.

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:02.445
AND IT'S NOT.

00:53:02.512 --> 00:53:03.547
ANYTHING THAT CAN BE RESOLVED

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:06.082
TODAY IS THE IDEA OF A DOCTOR'S

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:07.183
RECOMMENDATION VERSES A

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.820
PRESCRIPTION -- I HAVE A TOUGH

00:53:10.887 --> 00:53:12.556
TIME WITH THAT IF IF IT'S IF FOR

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:13.890
MAKING LEAPS AND BOUNDS AS WE

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:16.326
ARE AS A STATE IN THIS DIRECTION.

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:19.663
DESPITE THE THE FEDERAL --

00:53:19.729 --> 00:53:21.698
PLEASE THE MIME SO OFFBEAT

00:53:21.765 --> 00:53:24.301
BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN MOVE ON TO A

00:53:24.367 --> 00:53:25.902
MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTOR WHO

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:29.406
TREATS MINORS YOU HAVE TO GET.

00:53:29.472 --> 00:53:31.441
THE CONSENT OF YOUR PEDIATRICIAN

00:53:31.508 --> 00:53:34.110
OR NEUROLOGISTS OR THE COVERING

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:34.978
DOCTOR.

00:53:35.045 --> 00:53:37.247
PHIL -- NOT TO SAY THAT THEY

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:38.615
CAN'T WRITE THE RECOMMENDATION

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:41.551
AS WELL SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS

00:53:41.618 --> 00:53:43.453
THE PRESCRIPTION.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:44.588
SO YOU YOU CAN'T GET A

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:47.190
PRESCRIPTION FOR CANNABIS

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.325
JOCASTA YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AND

00:53:48.391 --> 00:53:54.097
LET ALONE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL --

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.365
ANYONE.

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:56.166
CAN GET A RECOMMENDATION.

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:57.567
NOT WHEN IT COMES TO MINORS

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:58.702
EXACTLY NOW WHEN IT COMES TO

00:53:58.768 --> 00:53:59.302
MINORS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT.

00:53:59.369 --> 00:53:59.970
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I'VE

00:54:00.036 --> 00:54:01.471
ALWAYS BEEN OF THE OPINION THAT

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:02.305
BEFORE MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:02.839
THEN.

00:54:02.906 --> 00:54:04.007
THE DOCTOR SHOULD BE IN A

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.475
POSITION OF HAVING TO STAND

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:07.110
BEHIND.

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.845
THEIR THEIR ADDRESS MEN ON OR

00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:10.981
DIAGNOSIS OF A GIVEN ISSUE AND

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:13.016
FOLLOW THROUGH ONE AS OPPOSED TO

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:13.617
RECOMMENDATION THAT'S A SIDE

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:14.284
ISSUE.

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:15.785
BUT IT IS THE PHYSICIAN IT IS A

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:18.888
MEDICAL DOCTOR THAT MAKES THE

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:19.723
RECOMMENDATION.

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:20.757
YES -- ONE HUNDRED OUT OF ONE

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:21.958
HUNDRED REQUESTED MY NECK OF THE

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.360
WOODS NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:26.262
DENIED -- RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD

00:54:26.329 --> 00:54:28.331
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEN

00:54:28.398 --> 00:54:29.232
WE SHOULD BE HAVING TO THE

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:29.599
CANNOT.

00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:31.401
CHATTER IF YOU'RE USING TINCTURE

00:54:31.468 --> 00:54:34.904
OF CVD OR SOMETHING IT IS.

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:36.539
THERE IS NO -- PSYCHEDELIC

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.708
BENEFIT YEAH THAT THIS IS JUST

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.443
LIKE PUTTING A HAND CREAM ON

00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:42.646
YOUR HANDS OR TAKING USING A

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:48.385
LITTLE SOMETHING FOR OF FRANKLY

00:54:48.451 --> 00:54:51.054
HOW ANTIQUATED.

00:54:51.121 --> 00:54:53.657
AND HOW THE THE NEANDERTHAL WE

00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:55.025
ARE WHEN IT COMES.

00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:56.493
TO DEALING WITH THE SUBSTANCE

00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.661
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY

00:54:57.727 --> 00:54:59.796
THEORETICALLY A DOCTOR SHOULD BE

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:01.431
ABLE TO PRESCRIBE IT RATHER THAN

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:03.733
RECOMMENDED BUT UNTIL WE GET

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:04.100
SOME.

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:05.101
SOME.

00:55:05.168 --> 00:55:07.237
THE INSIDE BY THE FEDERAL

00:55:07.303 --> 00:55:09.406
GOVERNMENT WE'RE KIND OF JUST TO

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:10.407
RETURNING OURSELVES INTO A

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.575
PRETZEL TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS

00:55:12.642 --> 00:55:14.611
AS IT SHOULD BE FOR PEOPLE WHO

00:55:14.678 --> 00:55:15.211
NEED IT.

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:17.213
BUT BUT APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.548
OTHER COMMON IF I MIGHT.

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.617
IS ARE AS FAR AS SCHOOL NURSES

00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:22.118
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:55:22.185 --> 00:55:23.887
SCHOOLS DON'T HAVE NURSES SO.

00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:25.255
THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WHEN

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.156
YOU AND I WERE IN SCHOOL ARM I

00:55:26.222 --> 00:55:27.590
SHOULD SAY I WAS IN SCHOOL LONG

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:29.325
BEFORE YOU.

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.660
EVERY SCHOOL DID HAVE A NURSE.

00:55:30.727 --> 00:55:32.662
BUT THEY DON'T TODAY SENATOR

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.130
STERN -- I WAS GONNA SAY

00:55:34.197 --> 00:55:35.965
ANYTHING BUT JUST TO BE CLEAR

00:55:36.032 --> 00:55:37.200
FOR THE RECORD THIS IS NOT ONLY

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.269
C. B. D. THIS IS ALSO THE

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:41.871
INGESTION OF THC THAT WOULD BE

00:55:41.938 --> 00:55:43.707
ALLOWED HERE SO IT'S NOT JUST --

00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:46.209
TOPICAL TINCTURES OUR BOMBS YOU

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:47.977
ACTUALLY THERE STILL IS THE

00:55:48.044 --> 00:55:50.413
PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS IN THE THC

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.449
EVEN IF MINOR OR SOME SMALL NOW

00:55:52.515 --> 00:55:53.717
WE KNOW IT'S USEFUL AS AN

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:55.151
ACTIVATION AGENT.

00:55:55.218 --> 00:55:56.419
WHEN CMBINED WITH THE C. B. D.

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:57.220
IS WHICH IS WHY THEY LEAVE IT IN

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:57.954
THERE BT?

00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:59.923
THERE STILL IS IN INJECT SOME

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.659
SOME AMOUNT OF TEACH SEATED

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:06.730
HELLO JOE OR YOUR SON.

00:56:06.796 --> 00:56:08.698
IN JAIL RIGHT.

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:09.232
AND SO SO ON THAT THE YOU

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:10.300
MENTION THE PUBLIC HEALTH FORM

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:10.900
NINETY FORTY FOUR I BELIEVE IS

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.969
WHAT IT IS.

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.605
I WOULD ACT THIS WAY -- LOW BLOW

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:19.075
THERE'S A PROTOCOL HELLO SURE

00:56:19.142 --> 00:56:23.113
HANDED TO THE SERGEANTS SERGEANT.

00:56:23.179 --> 00:56:24.180
AND SO THE ANSWER TO THIS IS

00:56:24.247 --> 00:56:24.881
WHAT PRECEDES THE MEDICAL

00:56:24.948 --> 00:56:26.282
RECOMMENDATION THIS IS THE

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.684
TRIGGER.

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:28.151
TO OR IS THIS IS THE

00:56:28.218 --> 00:56:29.986
DOCUMENTATION OF THE

00:56:30.053 --> 00:56:31.087
RECOMMENDATION.

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:32.922
AT THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:34.591
RECOMMENDATIONS SO DISASTROUS

00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:36.626
PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST -- AT

00:56:36.693 --> 00:56:38.228
KAISER FIND THAT THEY HAVE TO

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.229
PUT A PHONE NUMBER ON THERE AND

00:56:39.295 --> 00:56:40.697
EVERYTHING AND THEN I CAN MAIL

00:56:40.764 --> 00:56:42.031
THAT INTO THE STATE TO GET HIM A

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:43.032
CANNABIS CARD.

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.134
THAT WE COULD THEN GO TO

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.402
DISPENSARIES. TO GET MEDICATION

00:56:46.469 --> 00:56:49.072
FOR HIM BUT I WENT TO LIKE.

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:50.507
MULTIPLE DOCTORS WE CALLED

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:51.374
TWENTY WE WENT TO MULTIPLE

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.009
DOCTORS NOBODY WOULD SIGN THAT

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:53.877
FORM FOR US.

00:56:53.943 --> 00:56:55.979
BECAUSE ACREE WAS SIXTEEN MONTHS

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:56.579
OLD FIFTEEN MONTHS OLD AT THE

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:57.847
TIME SO.

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:59.616
THE PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST WE

00:56:59.682 --> 00:57:00.750
RECEIVE THE TIME SIGN THAT FORM

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:01.785
IN OUR CURRENT PEDIATRIC

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.153
NEUROLOGIST THAT WE SWITCH TO

00:57:03.219 --> 00:57:04.120
SIGN THAT FORM.

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:07.457
SO THEY CAN BE ON CAMPUS.

00:57:07.524 --> 00:57:08.057
FOR DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES AT

00:57:08.124 --> 00:57:08.825
HIS SCHOOL.

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.960
ALONG WITH CONSENT OF THAT

00:57:11.027 --> 00:57:13.263
DOCTORS SAYING THIS CHILD OR

00:57:13.329 --> 00:57:15.365
YOUNG ADULT NEEDS THIS TYPE OF

00:57:15.431 --> 00:57:17.834
MEDICATION -- THE OTHER THING

00:57:17.901 --> 00:57:19.102
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS NOW

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:20.837
THAT -- CANNABIS IS

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:22.939
RECREATIONALLY LEGAL HERE IN

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:26.075
CALIFORNIA -- THERE'S NOT SO

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.144
MANY A MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTORS

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.813
HANDING OUT RECOMMENDATIONS

00:57:29.879 --> 00:57:32.715
ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL.

00:57:32.782 --> 00:57:33.449
SO THERE.

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:36.386
IT LEVY IT DOES LEAVE THE FUEL --

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:38.021
MEDICAL MARIJUANA DOCTORS THAT

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:43.860
ARE TREATING AND A VERY SMALLER

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:45.762
AMOUNT THAT TREAT MINOR.

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.897
SO YOU -- THE DID YOU HAVE

00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:48.464
ANOTHER YEAH JUST JUST THIS

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:49.065
PROFESSION IS IT IS THERE ANY

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:51.034
WAY TO TO THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:52.368
WHERE BECAUSE I SEE IT'S IT AND

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:54.037
IT'S A RELATIVELY EXPANSIVE LIST

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.038
WHICH IS MAYBE WHERE THE LAST

00:57:55.104 --> 00:57:56.639
GOVERNOR'S CONCERN CAME IN

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:58.208
AROUND NAUSEA.

00:57:58.274 --> 00:58:01.578
OR ANY OTHER CHRONIC MEDICAL

00:58:01.644 --> 00:58:03.112
SYMPTOM THAT SUBSTANTIAL LIMITS

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:04.681
THE PERSON'S ABILITY CONDUCT

00:58:04.747 --> 00:58:07.250
MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES OR CHRONIC

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:09.786
PAIN SO STARTED TO DEAL WITH

00:58:09.853 --> 00:58:10.753
THESE [inaudible]

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.689
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUES

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:15.525
WITHOUT.

00:58:15.592 --> 00:58:16.492
GETTING INTO THE HIPAA VIOLATION

00:58:16.559 --> 00:58:18.328
BUT IS THERE IS THERE ANY WAY TO

00:58:18.394 --> 00:58:19.696
SORT OF THREAD THAT NEEDLE TO

00:58:19.762 --> 00:58:21.030
FIND A WAY.

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:22.966
TO SORT A NARROWLY ADDRESS THE

00:58:23.032 --> 00:58:24.467
YOUNG PEOPLE HERE BUT NOT SORT

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.369
OF HAVE THAT BACK DOOR IF THERE

NOT TO SEE YOU KNOW PARENTS ARE

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.145

JUDGMENT I MEAN THAT'S WHY WE

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.265
INTEREST.

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.200
THOSE DECISIONS TO THE MEDICAL

00:58:57.267 --> 00:58:59.202
PROFESSION. TO TO DETERMINE

00:58:59.269 --> 00:59:00.536
WHETHER THIS IS IN THE BEST

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:02.505
INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND AS WE

NOT A MEDICAL BOTTOM AMID THIS

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.777
ANOTHER MARIJUANA DR.

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:10.079

NEUROLOGIST WHO HAS TO MAKE THAT

00:59:13.883 --> 00:59:14.651
DECISION THIS IS A COLLECTIVE.

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.586
THIS IS BASICALLY A TREATMENT

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.187
FOR A CONDITION THAT HAS BEEN

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:21.791
MEDICALLY IDENTIFIED SO -- AND

00:59:21.858 --> 00:59:23.359
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ONE MORE

00:59:23.426 --> 00:59:24.827

OIL LIGHT AND GOES INTO THE

00:59:51.387 --> 00:59:53.723

THAT THIS IS NOT ONE BUT I

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:24.859
SUSPECT THAT'S THE CASE UP -- MY

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:26.261
UNDERSTANDING TO IS THAT SOME OF

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.129
THE FUNDING IT WILL BE COMING

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:28.763
FROM SOME OF THE DRUG

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:31.032
INTERDICTION PROGRAMS AS WELL IS

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:33.768
THAT IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:35.570
MY ASSUMPTION ALTHOUGH THERE'S

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.472
NOT BEEN COMPLETE DEFINITION

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:38.573
WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID IS THAT

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:39.974
MONEY'S GOING TO COME FROM THE

01:24:40.041 --> 01:24:41.209
COUNTER DRUG BUDGET.

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:45.480
OF THE COUNTER DRUG BUDGET IS --

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:48.616
IT IS IS -- A PRODUCT OF OUR

01:24:48.683 --> 01:24:51.386
NATIONAL COUNTER DRUG STRATEGY

01:24:51.453 --> 01:24:53.755
AND SO THE EXPERTS OR AT LEAST

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.023
THE PEOPLE THAT THE PRESIDENT

01:24:55.089 --> 01:24:56.324
BELIEVES OUR EXPERTS HAVE COME

01:24:56.391 --> 01:24:57.192
UP WITH THE COUNTER DRUG

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:58.726
STRATEGY IN A COUNTER DRUG

01:24:58.793 --> 01:24:59.994
BUDGET.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:02.130
THAT MEETS THAT STRATEGY -- THIS

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.399
IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM THAT

01:25:04.466 --> 01:25:06.534
STRATEGY THE US FUNDS ARE BEING

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.969
DIVERTED FROM WHAT THE

01:25:08.036 --> 01:25:09.537
PRESIDENT'S EXPERTS SAY THEY

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:11.506
SHOULD BE USED. FOR FOR ANOTHER

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:13.975
PURPOSE I WOULD SIMPLY SUGGEST

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.443
THAT THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GO

01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:16.845
WITH HIS OWN EXPERTS.

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.780
WITH THAT WOULD BE A CHANGE IN

01:25:18.847 --> 01:25:21.316
STRATEGY BY I THINK THIS WHITE

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:24.786
HOUSE BUT OF I THINK THE PART

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.421
THAT STRIKES ME WHEN IT COMES TO

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.256
THIS DRUG THE DRUG PROGRAMS THIS

01:25:28.323 --> 01:25:31.659
MORNING AND PUBLIC SAFETY. ONE

01:25:31.726 --> 01:25:32.794
OF CENTER BOARD USES COLLEAGUES

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:35.396
BROUGHT A BILL -- TO TRY TO

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:37.732
ADDRESS THE FRONT NO PROBLEM.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.200
WE KNOW THE FENNEL IS COMING

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:41.302
INTO THIS COUNTRY IN MASSIVE AND

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:43.471
VERY DANGEROUS QUANTITIES FROM

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:45.173
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD -- I

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.975
WOULD THINK THAT A IF WE REALLY

01:25:47.041 --> 01:25:48.676
DO WANT TO PROTECT THE SAFETY OF

01:25:48.743 --> 01:25:51.980
OUR PEOPLE WE WOULD BE LOOKING

01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:52.914
TO FUND THESE.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:55.350
DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAMS -- SO

01:25:55.416 --> 01:25:57.886
THAT WE COULD INDEED PROTECT OUR

01:25:57.952 --> 01:25:59.721
OUR PEOPLE IN THE SAFETY AND

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:01.656
SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY AND IT

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.024
WAS REALLY NO DISPUTE THAT THE

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.759
THE MAJOR PROBLEM COMES FROM

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:06.160
OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:10.365
AND THOSE DRUGS WE KNOW COME IN.

01:26:10.431 --> 01:26:11.099
EARLY THROUGH AIRPORTS IN OUR

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:13.201
PORTS AND IF THE MONEY'S BEING

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.169
TAKEN FROM THAT THAT FURTHER

01:26:15.236 --> 01:26:16.504
