FOURTEEN FIFTY TWO AND ONE BILL AB THIRTY ONE NINETY ONE- BITES A CINNAMON CHAO IS VOTE ONLY. BEFORE WE HEAR PRESENTATIONS WELL WE CAN'T STEPS OF CORN YET SO I WILL CALL OUR FIRST- AUTHOR. FOR IF WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS SO WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY ON AB. ONE TEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR IT AB ONE TEN WHICH REQUIRED CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THE EDT. TO CROSS CHECK UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST INCARCERATION RECORDS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. OVER THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC- WE'VE ALL WATCHED WITH WITH HORROR AND OUTRAGE AS HAVE MANY OF HER CONSTITUENTS ON THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS FAILED CALIFORNIA- ONE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF THIS HAS BEEN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FRAUDULENT CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN PAID OUT ADD TO. CART SHOULD INMATES WERE NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THESE BENEFITS FIVE THE STATE AUDITOR POINTED OUT IN A RECENT AUDIT REPORT THAT HE D. LET THEMSELVES ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO THIS TYPE OF FRAUD BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A REGULAR AND CONSISTENT PROCESS FOR CHECKING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS AGAINST INMATE RECORDS. AT THIS BILL IS GOING TO CLOSE THAT CRITICAL GAP IT IS A SIMPLE AND COMMONSENSE STEPS TO STOP FRAUD AND ENSURE WE'VE GOT THE RESOURCES TO DIRECT TO CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE MOST AT NEEDS OUT WITH THAT HAPPY TO WELCOME. I ASSISTANT JUST ATTORNEY. YOUNG FOR TESTIMONY. BURKE IF MISSION THANK YOU FOR CALLING HER. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LESLIE YOUNG ORANGE COUNTY ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN CHARGE OF MAJOR FRAUD ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY TODD SPITZER I STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE ON AB ONE TEN. IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPENCER DIRECTED THE MAJORITY OF OUR FRAUD UNITS RESOURCES BE USED TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS BY INMATES IN CALIFORNIA PRISONS. OUR OFFICE UNCOVERED MILLIONS IN FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS PAID TO THE INMATES COCONSPIRATORS IN ORANGE COUNTY ALONE WE FILED MULTIPLE FELONY CHARGES AGAINST EIGHT INDIVIDUALS IN THESE GAMES. BUT DESPITE NUMEROUS BANK SEARCH WARRANTS AND OTHER INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS TO FRAUDULENTLY DIVERTED FUNDS HAD VANISHED ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE OBTAINING RESTITUTION ORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE EDT. THE REALITY IS THAT MOST IF NOT ALL OF THAT MONEY WILL NEVER BE RETURNED TO TAXPAYERS. DURING OUR EXTENSIVE INVESTIGATION WE LEARNED THAT THESE EIGHT SUSPECTS ARE JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF A RAMPANT STATEWIDE FRAUDULENT UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS THE GAME INVOLVING STATE PRISONER APPLICANTS. HAD A MECHANISM THAT IN PLACE TO BLOCK THIS MONEY FROMDISTRIBUTION TO INELIGIBLE PRISON INMATES. UNTOLD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS WOULD HAVE BEEN SAFE GUARDED AND THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES DEVOTED ELSEWHERE. AB ONE TEN IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IN MINIMIZING THE LOSS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO FRAUD. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS MUST BE AVAILABLE TO HELP OUT OF WORK CALIFORNIANS NOT TO ENRICH INCARCERATED CRIMINALS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES WE THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER PETRIE-NORRIS FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND STRONGLY URGE AN AYE VOTE.

ALL RIGHT WE'LL MOVE IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY BRING IT BACK TO HIS OR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO AB ONE TEN. CINECOLOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN APOLOGIES FOR COMING IN A LITTLE LATE- I SO I DO I HAVE AND WE SAW A TO THE CHAIR WE SAW A SIMILAR BILL. ON EIGHTY D. FRAUD- IN SB THIRTY NINE GROW BY BELIEVE- AND SO. IN MY READING OF THIS BILL IT SEEMS LIKE THIS BILL GOES FARTHER THAN SB THIRTY NINE IN TERMS OF ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OF THOSE FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED AND SO WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE- COLLECTED AND SHARED BECAUSE I THINK IN THIS COMMITTEE THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION AROUND WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE- FOR- FIVE. FEET EIGHTY TO COLLECT- AND TO SHARE WITH CDCR AND VICE VERSA. HELLO AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION YES I AM PLEASED TO SAY THAT STOPPING YOU I FRAUD IS BOTH A BICAMERAL AND BIPARTISAN PUSH ARE WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD THING. IN TERMS OF AS THE ADDITIONAL DATA THAT'S BEING COLLECTED WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ON THAT AMENDMENT AND- THE REASON THAT WE ARE COLLECTING AS ADDITIONAL DATA ELEMENTS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT WE- DON'T CATCH ANYONE IN A CERTAINLY IN THE SNACK RIGHT THE ONE OF THE- THINGS WE WANNA MAKE SURE WE AVOID. IS THAT WE DECLINE A CLAIM INSURANCE CLAIM FOR SOMEBODY THAT'S A VALID CLAIM MEANT AND CITIES ADDITIONAL DATA ELEMENTS WILL ENSURE THAT ODD THAT THE CROSS CHECK IS ACCURATE WHEN IT'S BEING IMPLEMENTED- A COUPLE OF OTHER. THINK DISTINCTIONS AS WITH SENATOR GROVES BELL FIVE WE ARE GOING TO BE UPDATING I THE FIVE WE'RE GONNA BE SHARING INFORMATION EVERY THIRTY DAYS RATHER THAN EVERY NINETY DAYS AND AGAIN THAT'S TO ENSURE THAT. ITS CURRENT RIGHT IF SOMEONE IS NO LONGER INCARCERATED IN ELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THEM ON IN ADDITION WE WILL BE AUTOMATING THE PROCESS. OR WILL DOUBLE BE ASKING EIGHTY D. TO AUTOMATE THE PROCESS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT AS WELL TO ENSURE. DATA DATA INTEGRITY AND SECURITY. THANK YOU- SO I'M PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY I THINK THAT- I HAVE REAL PROBLEMS WITH CDC ARE I DON'T THINK THAT'S- AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. AND CREATING THESE KINDS OF- COLLABORATIONS WHERE CDCR INTO BECOMING AN ADJUNCT- EDT AGENCY IS CONCERNING FOR ME SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE NOT A FEW MONTHS AGO CDCR- LISTED SOMEONE IS BEING PRESENT AND ALIVE WHO HAD BEEN DECAPITATED IN THE CELL FOR MULTIPLE MULTIPLE HOURS AND SO OFFICIALLY BE THAT CAN'T EVEN. ACCURATELY IDENTIFY SOMEONE AS BEING ALIVE OR NOT TO THEN ASK THEM TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES LIKE SIFTING THROUGH THIS KIND OF INFORMATION- IS REALLY CONCERNING TO ME JUST BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE APPROPRIATE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN- CDC. AND I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN HAVE EDT DO ITS JOB PROPERLY RATHER THAN ATTACHING IT TO ALL OF THESE OTHER- DEPARTMENTS. IN AN EFFORT- TO MAKE SURE THAT CLAIMS GET OUT- THAT ARE LEGITIMATE TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO DESERVE IT. AND I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THIS FALSE NARRATIVE THAT MOST OF THE FOLKS WHO STOLE MONEY WHERE PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED I JUST PULLED UP AN ARTICLE- THAT MENTIONS OVER A HUNDRED IN ONE PARTICULAR CASE. OVER ONE HUNDRED OF THE FOLKS WHO- WERE INVOLVED IN THIS WAR FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED AND WITH THE VICTIMS OF IDENTITY FRAUD. IN FACT YOU HAD FOLKS ON THE OUTSIDE WHO WERE THE REAL PERPETRATORS USING THE IDENTITIES OF FOLKS WHO WERE INSIDE AND COLLECTING MONEY IN THEIR NAME- AND THEY HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT WE HAVE ALLOWED THIS NARRATIVE. TO COME OUT AND SPREAD THAT SAYS ALL THE FOLKS WHO ARE INSIDE WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE FOLKS WERE INSIDE WERE THE MASTERMINDS BEHIND THIS. AND IT'S- THEY HAVE NO WAY. OF SAYING THAT THAT IS FALSE BECAUSE NO ONE BELIEVES THEM ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN PRISON. AND I WANT US TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE GOVERNMENT WORK BETTER. WITHOUT CREATING SCAPEGOATS OUT OF FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY YOU KNOW IN PRISON- AND I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO FIND SOME ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARDS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. WITHOUT REALLY SORT OF- CONTINUING TO. SHARE PRIVATE INFORMATION- BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIX AN ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD BE FIXING WITH ANY D. D. AND SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN MAKE IT A LITTLE CLOSER- TO THE GROVE BILL THAT WE ACTUALLY SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME DISCUSSING IN THIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THAT BILL MADE. STRUCK THE RIGHT BALANCE IN TERMS OF REQUESTING INFORMATION AND HAVING THE CHECKS AND BALANCES SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE MAY BE DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS GETS TO THE FLOOR- THAT. I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS SENATOR LET ME JUST RESPOND TO IT BECAUSE A COUPLE OF THE POINTS YOU'RE A STATE I THINK ONE OF THE MOST. IMPORTANT POINT YOU RAISE IS THAT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IN MANY OF THESE CASES. THE INMATES NAMES WERE BEING USED TO FILE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS NOT BITE AND MAKE THEMSELVES BUT BY ORGANIZED FRAUD RINGS THAT WERE. OUTSIDE TO. THE INMATES WERE THEMSELVES VICTIMS AS YOU SAID IT IDENTITY THEFT AND SO THAT. IS ALSO. WHAT THIS BILL WILL PREVENT. IS ENSURING THAT. WHETHER IT'S INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE INCARCERATED OR SIMPLY INDIVIDUALS WHOSE NAMES ARE BEING UTILIZED THAT WE'RE NOT PAYING OUT FRAUDULENT CLAIMS IN THE NAMES OF INCARCERATED TO CALIFORNIANS- AND THEN THEY THE SECOND POINT THAT YOU MENTIONED AROUND CDC OURS. S. DATA DATA MANAGEMENT AND OTHER ISSUES I THINK THAT'S ALSO AN IMPORTANT- AN IMPORTANT POINT AND MY TEAM AND I'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH AT LEGAL AID AT WORK AND WITH THE ACLU ON ODD AND HAVE INCORPORATED THEIR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE THAT WE DO TO YOUR POINT HAVE APPROPRIATE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN PLACE SO AS YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT CHAD EARLIER IN THE PROCESS THEY WERE OPPOSE I THINK THAT THAT THIS BILL. INTO THE GROWTH VEHICLE NOT SURE WHERE THEY ARE ON HERS BUT- BECAUSE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THE WORK WE'VE DONE BY THE HAVE HAVE MOVED TO A NEUTRAL POSITION ON NOT. ON THE SPOT. I WOULD HOPE THAT THE IS WHAT SOME OF YOUR- AS WELL- NEED ADDITIONAL QUICK COMMENTER CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MATTER. I TO JUST WANNA THIS STATE MY CONCERNS ARE WITH CDC ARE BEING ABLE TO CONDUCT THIS INVESTIGATION AGAIN I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGES WITH A STATE IT WOULD EIGHTY D. BUT WE WOULD HOPE THAT YOU TAKE TO WORDS- BY SENATOR COM MARTYR. AND AS IT MOVES FORWARD FIND A WAY TO COLLEGE. HONI THE END TO WE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC IN. ACHIEVING THE GOALS H. I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH YOUR WITH THIS MEASURE SHOW WITH THAT NOTE- WE HAVE A TO PASS A RE REFER TO LABOR- COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. AND RETIREMENT AND WE'RE SEEKING A MOTION ON AB ONE TEN- SO MOVED IT'S BEEN MOVED. CANCEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB ONE TEN AB ONE TEN TO PASS TO LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT BRADFORD ON BRADFORD I'D CHOI BOGUE I TROUBLE GUY COM MARKER.

PICTURE WE HAVE A MOTION AGAIN THIS IS VOTE ONLY- AND I WILL LIST THE AMENDMENT- THE AUTHORS AGREE TO TAKE AMENDMENTS THAT CLARIFY THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS CAN ADOPT ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE USE AND REPORTING A MILITARY EQUIPMENT BY LOCAL LAW. ALEXI I'M SURE THAT'S TRUE YES I AM I'M- I'M- I'M SORRY I'M I'M RETIRED I KNEW THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT AND I'VE DONE THIS THIS BILL THE TO A MOMENT OR DISK IN CAN LAST WEEK YES OKAY EVEN ME THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE SOME ADDITIONAL MOMENTS TO REMOVE ALL THE OPPOSITION. AND THEY'LL TAKE IT IN NEXT COMMITTEE YES AND ARE. TAKEN LAST WEEK ARE IN PRINT. IT GOES TO THE FLOOR BUT THEY'VE AGREED TO TAKE SOME MOMENTS ON THE FLOOR WITH SOME OF THE OTHER. BUT THEY TOOK THE MOMENTS WE TALKED ABOUT LAST WEEK. I'M SORRY I'M LOOKING AT CHIU SAID JOBS. ALL RIGHT. CAN TO CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON. AB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE AB THIRTEEN NINETY ONE. BRADFORD ON RED FOR DIETRO BOKE I PROVOKE AYE COMMAGER AYE UNLOCKER AYE. WITH THE MEASURE HAS ENOUGH VOTES BUT WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS TO ADD ON NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO. GROSS AB T. N. OLD THREE BY SENATOR THàNH I MEAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ THANK L. A. M. THANK YOU TERRY AND MEMBERS AB ONE ZERO ZERO THREE WILL MAKE INTENTIONAL THEFT OF WAGES TIPS OR COMPENSATION BY EMPLOYERS PUNISHABLE AS GRAND THEFT. RIGHT NOW IF AN EMPLOYEE STEALS OVER NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS FOR THEIR EMPLOYER DID LIKELY END UP GOING TO JAIL. BUT NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND FOR FAR TOO LONG BUSINESSES HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH COMMITTING WAGE THEFT INTENTIONALLY AND STEALING FROM THE WORKERS ALL WHILE FACING NOTHING MORE THAN A SLAP ON THE WRIST A SMALL FINE. HOWEVER WAGE THEFT IS A SERIOUS CRIME MINIMUM WAGE VIOLATIONS ALONE COST THIS COUNTRY FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY COMPARED TO TWELVE BILLION LOSSES FROM ROBBERIES BURGLARY AND AUTO THEFT COMBINED THIS IS HARDER MONEY THAT BELONGS TO WORKERS MONEY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN MADE. THE DIFFERENCE FOR FAMILIES DECIDING BETWEEN BUYING GROCERIES OR PAYING OTHER BILLS. BUT TO BUSINESS IT'S SOMETIMES JUST A WAY TO SAVE MONEY INCREASE THEIR PROFITS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYERS MAKING ACCIDENTAL PAYROLL MISTAKES WERE TALKING ABOUT PLAYERS MAKING CALCULATED RISKS TO STEAL. BECAUSE IT'LL RESULT IN MINOR FINES OR CIVIL PENALTIES WHICH CAN BE ACTUALLY LESS THAN PAYING THE WORKER WHAT THEY'RE OUT. WITH THE CONSEQUENCES COMPANIES FACE ARE LESS SEVERE THAN THE CRIME ITSELF IT'S NO WONDER THE COMMISSION WAIT SEVEN OFF IS OFTEN A BUSINESS DECISION TO BASED EMPLOYERS BOTTOM LINE. THIS BILL WILL DETER BAD ACTORS FROM COMMITTING WAGE THAT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT PROSECUTORS CAN GO AFTER EMPLOYERS WHO INTENTIONALLY STEAL FROM THE WORKERS. THE BILL HAS RECEIVED UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT COMMITTEE AND THE CHAMBER AND HAS- THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS REMOVED ITS OPPOSITION. TODAY I HAVE THE CHAIRMAN- FOR THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION PEDRO NAVA CALLING INTO TESTIFYING SUPPORT. MR NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY.

THIS ACTIVITY HURTS EVERYONE LONG TERM BUSINESS OWNERS STRUGGLE TO STAY AFLOAT AS COMPETITORS BENEFIT FROM THE GLORY LOST INNOCENT WORKERS ARE HARASSED AND DEMOTED THE FILING UNFAIR WAGE CLAIMS AGAINST UNSCRUPULOUS BOSSES AND CALIFORNIA LOSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE BECAUSE OF IT. YET PEOPLE PARTICIPATE IN THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY SIMPLY BECAUSE THE CRIME ACTUALLY DOES PAY IN OUR REPORT ENTITLED LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD BUT CALIFORNIA'S UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OUT OF BUSINESS WE FOUND THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS DO NOT INCENTIVIZE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE THE REWARDS OF BREAKING THE LAW OUTWEIGH THE RISK TO CHANGE THIS WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS EXISTING PENALTIES. FOR WHITE COLLAR CRIMES AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT THE REWARDS OF BREAKING THE LAW DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE PENALTIES IMPOSED IF CAUGHT BREAKING IT AB ONE ZERO ZERO THREE WE pRECOMMENDATION BY MAKING AN EMPLOYER'S INTENTIONAL FELT OF WAGES PUNISHABLE AS GRANTS UP WHEN COLLECTIVELY GREATER THAN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS ON BEHALF OF THE LOOPER COMMISSION I RESPECTFULLY.

RAPID SMALL BUSINESSES APPEAR TO. BEAR THE BRUNT OF AB TENTH- THREE. AS OUR LETTER STATED OVERSIGHT OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND SYMBOL CONSEQUENCES ARE NECESSARY FOR STATE START. HOWEVER IT'S OUR POSITION AT THE GROWING RABBIT TO THE LABOR LAWS- PLACING A BARRIER SUSPICION BETWEEN EMPLOYEES AND THEIR EMPLOYER BEFORE THE RELATIONSHIP HAS EVEN BEGUN. AS CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO EMERGE FROM THE STRANGLEHOLD OF COVERED NINETEEN. DIED HAS TRULY.

PART TIME WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE A CLOSE I JUST NOTE- GIVEN OPPOSITION THAT WAS NEW TO ME- THIS DOESN'T ADD ANY. ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO BUSINESSES THAT'S BASICALLY. EAT FOR ACTUALLY AS CREATE A PROSECUTOR MORE LESS RESTATES THE LIVE SOMEBODY INTENTIONALLY STEALS MONEY IT IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW A PAGA CLAIM ARE HAVING SOME MISTAKE. ACTUALLY STILL THE MAIN EXAMPLES THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY IN COMMITTEE- THERE WAS A GUY WHO BY HIS EMPLOYER WAS TOLD TO PUT INTO DIFFERENT SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. AND WHEN IT REACHED EIGHT HOURS- HE WOULD PAY ON SECOND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY OVERTIME. THAT'S INTENTIONAL WAGE THAT THAT IS SOMEBODY TRYING TO- FORCING A WORKER TO BREAK THE LAW IN ORDER THAT THEY CAN PAY THEM LESS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT MINOR VIOLATIONS OF. LABOR LAW THAT ARE UNINTENTIONAL AN INCONSEQUENTIAL- AND I HAVE TO RESULT OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT. THANK YOU. WE HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT AND RETIREMENT- TO HAVE A MOTION THIS BILL. REMOVED IT'S BEEN PROPERLY MOVED BY SENATOR MITCHELL BALK. CANCEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB TEN OH THREE AB TENO THREE BRADFORD ARE REDFORD I'D CHOKE I TROUBLE GUY COME LONGER SKINNER WIENER BELIEVES THE RULES COMPLY ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ THE KEYONE MAKER CENTER. ART NOW WE'RE GOING TO IT'S A MOVEMENT CHIU AND HE HAS AB. FORTY EIGHTY ONE. WHEN YOU'RE PREPARED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN A LET ME FIRST START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS BILL AND I WANT TO JUST MENTION I'M HAPPY TO- EXCEPT THE MOMENT THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE NEXT COMMITTEE TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT BE PREEMPTING ANY LOCAL ORDINANCES. IN THIS AREA. AB FORTY ONE WILL ESTABLISH TRANSPARENCY BETWEEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND THEIR POLICE DEPARTMENTS WITH REGARD TO THE USE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT. AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR I KNOW THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA OUR OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT IN A POST GEORGE FOR A WORLD. WE NEED TO CONSIDER HOW EQUIPMENT AND TACTICS IMPACT THAT PARTNERSHIP. OUR STATE HAS LED THE NATION IN THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY WEAPONRY OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS PROCURED. TO THE TUNE OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIRTIES HAVE SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT LINK BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS OBTAINED BY POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND THE NUMBER OF POLICE SHOOTINGS. THIS PAST YEAR CALIFORNIANS SAW AN ALARMING RANGE OF EQUIPMENT IN ACTION DURING PEACEFUL PROTESTS WHEN POLICE SPRAY TEAR GAS FOR MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHERS AND SHOT RUBBER BULLETS. FROM ARMORED VEHICLES. THE DECISIONS OF HOW TO DEPLOY THIS SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT WERE LEFT UP TO INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AT THE SCENE WITHOUT UNIFORM PROTOCOLS. THIS BILL ASKS OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND GOVERNING BOARDS TO COME UP WITH APPROPRIATE MILITARY EQUIPMENT POLICIES THAT CAN BE DELIBERATED AND APPROVED IN A PUBLIC SETTING. THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN AND WHY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVE THEY NEED MILITARY CALIBER EQUIPMENT. ESPECIALLY WHEN PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE USED TO PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT. AND AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES YOU HAVE ERICA SAYS SPECIFICALLY IT SUCCESS WITH US I'M SORRY. AND BRIANNA SWIFT FULLER. I THINK WE HAVE CASEY SHORT IN PLACE OF FIVE MRS BENNIS. DR. WITH THE READY WILL ALLOW THEM TO BEGIN WE'LL GIVE YOU THREE MINUTES EACH. HOPEFULLY THERE ON THE ALL DAY I THANK YOU EVERYONE- I WAS GOING TO LET YOU KNOW MY NAME YOU CAN SHORT I AM THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF THE NONPROFIT WE STAND UNITED SAN DIEGO AND ALSO- A MILITARY VETERAN OUR MILITARY POLICE. I HAVE SERVED THE UNITED STATES ARMY FOR OVER TWELVE YEARS NOW I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND THE TECHNOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE. OF MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE LAWS IN PLACE TO STOP THE USE OF MILITARY BY THREE. PEOPLE PROTEST ACTUATION AS BEING BOTH BY ORGANIZER TWO ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROTEST INTELIGO HISTORY. AND AMAZED AT. WITH THE USE OF THE MILITARY WEAPONS ADDED BECAUSE- WHOLE ENTIRE. OF ANGER OF PEOPLE THAT WERE ALREADY TURNING INTO WHETHER WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO PEOPLE OF COLOR ABOUT THE CRIME IN THE UNITED STATES. I'M ASKING YOU ALL TO PLEASE PRACTICE FOR THIS BILL. ABOUT THE USE OF MILITARY GRADE WEAPONS. WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF BEARING OR ANY TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU Q. IS THERE ARE CERTAIN WITNESS. IN SUPPORT. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN AREA. EARLY STAGE NAME OR THE AFTERNOON. THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS BRIANNA'S LIFE WORK A GOOD AFTERNOON- COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY I AM AN ATTORNEY WITH BECAUSE NOBODY OF THE NEEDLE AND I AM HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF WOMEN CONDITIONER CALIFORNIA AS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE. CALIFORNIA POLICE AGENCIES HAVE BEEN MILITARIZING FOR DECADES WITH LITTLE TO NO OVERSIGHT- ONE PROGRAM THE TEN THIRTY THREE PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA POLICE HAD ACQUIRED HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT INCLUDING MINE RESISTANT AMBUSH PROTECTED VEHICLES. UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLES ASSAULT RIFLES AND NIGHT VISION SNIPER SCOPE. OTHER FEDERAL PROGRAMS DON'T REQUIRE ANY REPORTING BUT A CATALOG WITH EVERYTHING FROM ARMORED VEHICLES NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. WHO IS THE ENEMY POLICE ARE TRYING TO COMBAT. A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN STUDY FOUND MILITARIZED POLICE FORCES WERE MOST OFTEN DEPLOYED IN BLACK COMMUNITIES EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PRIMARY AND SEVERAL STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASED POLICE MILITARIZATION AN INCREASED POLICE TELLING. ALL THIS HARM THERE IS NO BENEFIT. STUDY SHOW POLICE MILITARIZATION FAILED TO REDUCE CRIME FAILED TO ENHANCE OFFICER SAFETY AND FAILED TO SUPPORT A PUBLIC TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE PRESENTS AN EASY FIX. POLICE AGENCIES ALREADY REPORT INFORMATION ABOUT PLANNED PURCHASES DURING THE ANNUAL BUDGET REVIEW PROCESS. THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DETAIL ABOUT THE EQUIPMENT THOUGHT AS WELL AS THE USE POLICY BEFORE POLICE CAN BRING THE MOST EXTREME FOR LIKE EQUIPMENT INTO OUR COMMUNITY. THIS IS A MINIMAL ASK OF OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. POLICE MAY CLAIM THEY NEED THIS EQUIPMENT. JUST SAYING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IN THE PROCESS. AB FOUR EIGHT ONE IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION TO ADVANCE RACIAL JUSTICE REDUCE POLICE VIOLENCE AND INSERT BASIC TRANSPARENCY MEASURES. ALL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES INCLUDING THOSE HEADED BY ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE SUBJECT TO OVERSIGHT. THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF GOVERNMENT MUST BE IMPLEMENTED WITH REGARDS TO EQUIPMENT ORIGINALLY MEANT FOR THE BATTLEFIELD. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON EIGHTY FOUR EIGHT ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.

IN A LIGHT. ONE HUNDRED. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE- ONE LEAD WITNESS COREY SHELVES ALL- WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION WILL PROVIDE HIM WITH THIRTY MINUTES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY SO THEY'LL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO A BEFORE ANYONE. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE ACQUISITION OF MILITARY SURPLUS PROPERTY OFTEN REQUIRES BIDDERS TO RESPOND QUICKLY WITHOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE LEGISLATIVE BODY REGARDING EACH PURCHASE. EVEN IF THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO THE FIRST TIME AGENCY SEEKS TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AB FORTY ONE STILL SEVERELY DISADVANTAGES CALIFORNIA AGENCIES IN THEIR ATTEMPT AT A PARTICIPATION. ADDITIONALLY THE DEFINITION OF QUOTE UNQUOTE MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN THIS BILL. WHICH INCLUDES QUOTE MILITARY SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT THAT READILY MAY BE USED FOR MILITARY PURPOSES REMAIN EXCEEDINGLY FAST AND ALMOST ASSUREDLY INCLUDES ITEMS COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BE ON VEHICLES AND FIREARMS. HOWEVER EVEN IF THE MEASURE LACKED THOSE DEFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF WHAT EQUIPMENT INCLUDED WE REMAIN OPPOSED. THE BILL INTERFERES WITH THE ABILITY OF INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS TO ACQUIRE EQUIPMENT AT A COST SAVINGS FOR DEPLOYMENT FOR REASONABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT PURPOSES. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED SB THIRTY ONE THIRTY ONE A SIMILAR BILL THAT DID NOT GO SO AS FAR AS THIS TO REQUIRE GOVERNING BODY APPROVAL. ANDIN HIS VETO MESSAGE SHE STATED QUOTE THE CURRENT LIST NOT ONLY INCLUDES ITEMS ARE CLEARLY MILITARISTIC AND STYLE. BUT MANY THAT ARE COMMONLY USED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT DO NOT MERIT ADDITIONAL BARRIERS FOR THE ACQUISITION. IN MY VIEW THIS BILL CREATES AN UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC HURDLE WITHOUT COMMENSURATE PUBLIC BENEFIT MY CANNOT SIGN IT. FOR THESE REASONS MISTER CHAIR CS IS A MUST RESPECTFULLY POSING BEFORE ANYONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW WILL GO TO THIS HEARING ROOM ARE THERE IS THERE ANYONE HERE WAS TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB FOUR EIGHTY ONE. RT COMMITTEE TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. NOW ALL RIGHT I CAN SEE PART- AND TWENTY FORTY IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION WHICH YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE NOW LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES- MODERATOR AND SHIFTERS ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO FORTY ONE.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS COLIN WITH ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION ACTUALLY TRYING TO CALL IN TO GET SUPPORT SB FOUR EIGHT ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN LINE. ONE HUNDRED FORTY. MISTER CHAIRMAN BURKE BRANDED UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ON THE V. FORTY ONE SIR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THROUGH THE CHAIR DO IT ARE THERE ANY OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS THE ONLY PERSON I HEARD ON THE PHONE WAS THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE SANTA CLARA BOARD OF SUPERVISORS BUT THEN ALL OF THE OTHER FOLKS WHO ARE LISTED IN SUPPORT FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WERE ANY- FOR. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE IN SUPPORT OF IT. AND THE REASON WHY I ASK IS BECAUSE IT DOES SORT OF- MOVE INTO THE SPACE OF LOCAL CONTROL- SO JUST ENOUGH YOU'VE GOTTEN ANY FEEDBACK FROM THEM. SULUR SO WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THERE'S NOT SPECIFIC FEEDBACK EITHER WAY BUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES REAL LOCAL CONTROL TO COMMUNITIES TO DECIDE WHAT MILITARY EQUIPMENT- THEY WANT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO AGAIN THIS BILL. CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES IN A TRANSPARENT WAY IN A PUBLIC FORUM TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT IS NOT- AND- AND THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THANK YOU IN ADDITION SENATOR- TROUBLED. M. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE I ALONG WITH US IN A CALM LONGER OF ALSO GOING IN THINKING ABOUT THE LOCAL DESERT JURISDICTION AND CONTROL. THE SENSE THAT. SH HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE NOTION THAT THAT SHERIFFS WERE ELECTED- SHOULD HAVE THAT CAPACITY- AND OF COURSE. AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR- INTENTION AS FAR AS CREATING A PROCESS BUT- COULD NOT ALREADY BE IN PLACE- IS NOT ALREADY SORT OF AN OPTION FOR LOCAL JEUGD JURISDICTIONS INCLUDING THE CITY COUNCIL COUNCILS AS WELL AS- THE SHARES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEY ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE FOOD THEIR COMMUNITY ELECT TO GUIDE- IN IN VERY SPACES INCLUDING THIS PARTICULAR ONE. SO LET ME MENTION A COUPLE OF ASPECTS OF THIS BILL- SO FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL DOESN'T PROHIBIT ANY TYPE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM BEING OBTAINED BY ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO IF A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY WANTS ANY MILITARY TANK ANY MILITARY- ANY FIREARM ANY OTHER SORTS OF EQUIPMENT THEY CAN DO THAT- AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNING BODY- AND THERE'S A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR THAT ADOPTION. WITH REGARDS TO SHARE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ELECTED LIKE ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC THROUGH SAY THE BUDGETARY PROCESS OF A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WERE CITY COUNCIL. WEIGHS IN ON WHETHER THESE ARE EXPENDITURES THAT THAT MAKES SENSE AND WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SHALL CONCENTRICALLY HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH A LOCAL GOVERNING BOARD TO SAY THIS IS THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT. THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO USE WE WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE I AND TO HAVE THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION AND IF. IF THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AGREES WITH THAT THEY WOULD SET UP A PROCESS BEFOREHAND SO THAT WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY COMES UP FOR A SHARE OF FOR A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AGENCY TO PURCHASE THAT EQUIPMENT FROM THE MILITARY THEY CAN DO THAT SO. WHAT WHAT WE ARE SAYING THOUGH IS- WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY PROVIDING UNLIMITED BLANK CHECKS WITH ZERO TRANSPARENCY ANSWER ACCOUNTABILITY PERCENT OUT TO BE A PUBLIC PROCESS SO THAT'S EFFECTIVELY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. AND RIGHT NOW WITH CURRENTLY SAY AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WITH- THAT. COUNTIES AND SHERIFF'S THEY DON'T OR LET'S JUST BE WITH THE COUNTY PART OF IT. WITH REGARDS THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS YOU'RE IN. YOUR OPINION THE REASON THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF WHAT CURRENTLY ABSOLUTE IMPOSES THE ACT. REALLY YES THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A PROTEST AND WEAPONRY IS PULLED OUT. THE PUBLIC IS SURPRISED THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WERE THESE TYPES OF ARMORED VEHICLES- THAT HAD BEEN PURCHASED BY DEPARTMENT OR- THAT A SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT MAY HAVE CHOSEN. TO MAKE A DECISION TO BRING IN EQUIPMENT OUT WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND THERE ARE NO. THERE OFTENTIMES HASN'T BEEN A PUBLIC CONVERSATION NOT ALL THE TIME BUT BUT IT HAS HAPPENED. NOR HAVE THERE BEEN ANY POLICIES ON HOW CERTAIN TYPES OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE USED SO PART OF WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS ENSURING TRANSPARENCY AROUND. WHAT'S PURCHASED BUT ALSO PROVIDING SOME GUIDELINES ON WHEN CERTAIN TYPES OF WEAPONRY- HOW THEY CAN BE USED. INTERESTING OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION SURVEYS ON THIS MEASURE ARM ASSIGNMENT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU ARE WE SHOULD GET MORE I WISH IT WOULD BAN THE PURCHASING OF THIS TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AND COMMUNITIES BECAUSE AS WHEN YOU'RE SUPPORTER STATED THE ONLY PLACE YOU SEE THIS TYPE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES ARE IN POOR COMMUNITIES I MEAN WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU SEEN PARA MILITARY. EQUIPMENT IN BEVERLY HILLS ARE AROUND A OR A LOS GATOS AREN'T ANY MORE INFLUENCE NEIGHBORHOODS BUT WE CLEARLY SAW LAST YEAR DURING ALL THE OF THE GEORGE GEORGE FLOYD PROTEST THE NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE CONFRONTED BY SUCH WEAPONRY WHERE DO WE SEE IT EVEN ON JANUARY SIX WHEN THEY STORMED OUR NATION'S CAPITAL YOU SAW NO PARA MILITARY EQUIPMENT BEING ROLLED OUT THIS STOP THAT RIGHT IS NOW. ANGRY MOB BUT WE SEE IT ALL THE TIMES INDUSTRY TO LOS ANGELES AND- I SEE NO NEED FOR IT AND- I'LL LET YOU SEE LOCAL POLICING A NUMBER TO HAVE CONFIDENCE AND TRUST IT YOU SHOULD TREAT PEOPLE IN APPROACH PEOPLE IN A IN A HUMANE WAY A ROLLING TANKS INTO POOR COMMUNITIES. ARE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES OUT IS A MESSAGE THAT OF RISK OR KNOW I JUST. I'M I'M GET ON MY SOAP BUT I YOU BRINGING THIS FOR AND I- RE THINK WE NEED TAKE HEED FROM WHAT YOU'RE TO DO AND I ASK WHY DO WE NEED TO PURCHASE A STEP OF WHEN WE GO UNTIL LOCAL CAN WHO WERE NOT ARM TO LEVEL OF YOU SEE AND MORE TIME BATTLE SO- AFTER PER TIME WILL LOOK. FOR MOTION ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE YOUR- THANK YOU. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AT IT AGAIN APPRECIATE pTHE DISCUSSION ON THIS AN EGG AND I AGAIN WANT TO REITERATE- TO THE CHAIRS POINT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT BANS ANY TYPE OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT AS MUCH AS I THINK THERE MAY BE COMMUNITIES THAT WILL WANT TO IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT BEFORE A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OBTAINS HIS EQUIPMENT. TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNING BOARD ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH MIGHT BE PROCURED THE POTENTIAL USES FOR THIS BECAUSE AGAIN AS A TEACHER POINTED OUT WHEN WE'VE SEEN THIS PAST YEAR THE MILITARY GRENADE LAUNCHERS THE ARMORED VEHICLES THAT SURPRISE COMMUNITIES WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT OUT- IT IT PICKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE USE OF SCARCE PUBLIC FUNDS AND- AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF HAVING. A DISCUSSION HAVING ACCOUNTABILITY HAVING TRANSPARENCY THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT- WE HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO- TO. GO THAN FINANCE WE'RE SEEKING A MOTION ON AB FORTY ONE. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SEN RECALL LONGER COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON A. B. FOUR EIGHT ONE AB FOUR EIGHT ONE BRADFORD HI I PROVIDE CHOI BOGUE NO FOR BOTH NOW CALM LONGER. I AM I RIGHT. THANK IN OUR WINNER. WE'LL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR UP TO MEMBERS THANK YOU. NOW WE'RE MOVING ON CHOOSE. WE HAVE A J. A. B. SEVEN THREE ONE BY FAR QUE HAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY PROCEED. NUMBER THE FIRST ONE I THINK IT'S A FOR ALL THEIR WORK IN EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON THIS BILL AB SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS A GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY MEASURE THAT WILL REQUIRE COUNTY SHERIFF'S TO COMPILE AND SUBMIT DATA ON RECIDIVISM REDUCTION PROGRAMS PROVIDED TO INMATES IN COUNTY JAILS AND THE SUCCESS RATES OF THESE PROGRAMS IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM SINCE REALIGNMENT WAS ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE ANNUAL STATE BUDGET HAS FUNDED COUNTY BASED PROGRAMS THAT AIM TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. THERE THEY'VE BEEN CONDUCTED FOR A DECADE INFORMATION ON THE SUCCESS OF THESE RECIDIVISM PROGRAMMING IS FRAGMENTED AND DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND IT IS SIMPLY ILLOGICAL TO INVEST EIGHT DOLLARS AND WE HAVE NO IDEA IF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY HELPING TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM OR IMPROVE LIVES IN MARCH AN AUDIT OF ALAMEDA FRESNO LA COUNTIES BY THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT COUNTIES LACK PLANNING AND OVERSIGHT FOR REALIGNMENT SPENDING IN OUR HOLDING EXCESSIVE REALIGNMENT SURPLUSES WHICH COULD BE USED TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR THE INCARCERATED POPULATIONS. IS INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING FULL TRANSPARENCY TO THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE SPENT OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDED HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS INVESTMENT. EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE OCURRE STANDARDIZED EVALUATION OF RECIDIVISM REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT SUCCESS. THE DATA FROM THE BILL WILL ALLOW US TO INVEST IN PROGRAMMING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS WITH ROBUST REPORTING INFORMED LEGISLATION CAN BETTER MAINTAIN PUBLIC SAFETY. REDUCE THE DIRE IMPACT FOR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS AND REDUCE LOCAL CORRECTION OF COST SAVING THE STATE MILLIONS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS. MY OFFICE IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP CLEAR REPORTING METRICS WILL GIVE WHICH WILL GIVE THE LEGISLATURE THE INFORMATION WE NEED. AS WELL AS PROVIDE CLARITY FOR COUNTIES AND HOW TO GATHER AND SUBMIT THE DATA. TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DEREK MORGAN OF THE ELEVATORS AT BAKER CENTER AND EXTORT OTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. I WILL GIVE YOU BOTH THREE MANAGED FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU MAY BEGIN IN WHATEVER ORDER YOU FEEL MOST. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT THE CARE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DEREK MORGAN AND ON BEHALF OF THE ALL BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS I AM PLEASED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS BASIC ACCOUNTABILITY. AND TRANSPARENCY. THREE YEARS AGO THE ELEVATOR CENTER LED A LOCAL GRASSROOTS CAMPAIGN THAT HAD A VERY SIMPLE APPS ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERVISORS. APPROVED A FINANCIAL IN THE FORMS ON IT SANTA RITA JAIL. WATCH THE CAMPAIGN IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL DISCREPANCIES WERE NOTICING AND COUNTY JAIL SPENDING AS WELL AS AN ALARMING RATE OF CIVIL SUITS ALLEGING MISTREATMENT AND ABUSE. FOR EXAMPLE THE JAIL POPULATION HAD DECREASED BY NEARLY HALF OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE. YET DURING THAT SAME PERIOD THE SHARES BUDGET INCREASED BY OVER 80% PUBLIC RECORDS ALONG WITH DIRECT COMMUNICATIONS WITH PEOPLE INSIDE THE JAIL BASED VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS OVER HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. LACKED AND THE STREET BUT- EVEN DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC WALK COUNTY FUNDS WERE ON LIFE SUPPORT BECAUSE THE SHERIFF'S BUDGET INCREASE. FIFTY BY OUR JAIL XPANDING INHUMANE ISOLATION POLICY WHERE PEOPLE GET LESS THAN THIRTY MINUTES A DAY TO BE OUT OF COUNTY JAIL CELL. AMID THE LAWSUIT TO MORE PEOPLE IN CUSTODY JUST THIS YEAR THE DOJ INVESTIGATION INTO JANET YEAH COUNTY JAIL FOUNDED PATTERN OF. UNCONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BUSINESS. HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES AND TO DIAL UP SERVICES ESPECIALLY TO THOSE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS. BURKE COUNTY OFFICIALS NEVER APPROVED OUR REQUEST FOR JAIL AUDIT AND TO DATE WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL SPENDING A FUN. HOW CAN WE ACCEPT THIS. I HIGHLIGHTS GENERALLY TO JAIL IS A CLEAR EXAMPLE OF A JAIL WITH VERY LITTLE TRANSPARENCY OVERT FONG. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE. SUPPORT SERVICES FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE ESSENTIAL LIFE SAVING INVESTMENT IN VALUABLE TAX DOLLARS INTO PEOPLE WHO WILL EVENTUALLY RETURN HOME TO OUR COMMUNITY. THIS BILL PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ON THE BEST USE OF FUNDING AIMED AT SERVICES TO SHOW EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM. FOR THESE REASONS BILL BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. OF COURSE. EIGHTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE AND WE URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NEXT DOOR DOES NOT BE HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER ASSOCIATION AND PARKING IS A VERY SIMPLE BILL AND AT THE TOP OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING TAXPAYERS MONEY ON AND WHAT RESULTED THAT SPENDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED WE MAKE SURE THAT FUNDS DESIGNED TO HELP REINTEGRATE CALIFORNIANS ARE SPENT ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DESIGNED TO DO THIS. AND THAT WE KNOW THE RESULTS OF THAT PRETENDING THAT THIS IS SIMPLY AND REQUESTED THE SHERIFF'S BE TRANSPARENT WITH HOW THEY'RE SPENDING FIND DESIGNATED FOR THAT PURPOSE. AND FOR THAT REASON YOUR SUPPORT. RIGHT BAGGINS OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES SUPPORT NOW WILL GO BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE AT THERE'S ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF. AB SEVEN THREE ONE NOW IS THE TIME I SEE NINE NOW WILL GO TO. OVERFLOW ROOM IN TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL. NOW MODERATE WILL GO TO OUR PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AB.

GOOD AFTERNOON NECESSARY ME ON BEHALF VANISHING JUSTICE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU LINE ONE LINE. ONE HUNDRED. HELLO THIS IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO WITNESS IN OPPOSITION WE SHOULD BE A ONE LEAD ARE WITH US IN OPPOSITION COREY CELLS ALL WILL GIVE HIM THIRTY MINUTES OF TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CORY CELLS L. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. AGAIN RESPECTFULLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SHERIFFS ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDE EANINGFUL REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING TO JAIL INMATES WITH THE DESIRE TO ENHANCE FORMERLY INCARCERATED PERSONS REENTRY INTO SOCIETY. AND TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT PEOPLE RE OFFEND UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL IMPOSES VAGUE AND BURDENSOME DATA COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT ANY GUARANTEE OF FUNDING TO COVER THE BILLS COSTS. THE BILL REQUIRES SHERIFF'S REPORT QUOTE DATA ON EACH OF THE ANTI RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS THEY PROVIDE AND MAINTAIN THEIR COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES ONE QUOTE. THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS SOUGHT BY THIS LANGUAGE IS UNCLEAR AND LIKELY DEAL DISPROPORTIONATE SAYS FROM THE FIELD. WE IN THE BILL THE BILL FAILS TO DEFINE THE TERM RE OFFEND AND SUCCESS. OF THOSE TERMS RELATED TO RECIDIVISM AND OFFER PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL COULD BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING COUNTY JAILS TO ASCERTAIN FROM CORK'S OTHER JAILS STATE PRISONS- INCLUDING THOSE ENTITIES AND OTHER STATES ABOUT INFORMATION PASSED TO SUBSEQUENT ARRESTS OR CONVICTIONS TO DETERMINE IF A PERSON HAS RECEVIED. THIS WOULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE THE PROBLEM EXACERBATED BY THE FACT THE BILL PROVIDES NO FUNDING BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. THAT EVEN IF THE BILLS ENACTED AS WRITTEN THE DATA THAT COMES FROM THIS BILL WILL VARY BY COUNTY. AND WILL UNLIKELY BE USEFUL IN ANY ATTEMPT TO MEASURE SUCCESS OR BENCHMARK PERFORMANCE AGAINST STANDARDS ARE OTHER COUNTIES BECAUSE THE TERMS ARE DEFINED. AND THE DATA THAT ARE REQUESTED. JUST AREN'T CLEAR- AND SO AGAIN WE UNDERSTAND- THE AUTHOR'S INTENT WITH THE BILL- BUT RESPECTFULLY WE DON'T THINK- EVEN IF ENACTED THIS IS GOING TO YIELD USEFUL INFORMATION- AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU. GREAT NOW WILL COME BACK TO FORTY TWO OR THREE OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO. SB SEVEN THREE I'M AB SEVEN THREE ONE. YOU MAY TEST. MY NAME IS SERGEANT CHILE'S CHRISTIAN SALMON COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE A SURE OF JOHN MCMAHON BUT WE DO NOT OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT WE DO SOME OF THE OF LETTER OF CONCERN.

OUR MEMBERS BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S IN OPPOSITION. NEXT WITNESS AT AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. RIGHT WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS CENTER CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK GOD FOR BRINGING THIS- BILL FORWARD IN REFERENCING THE AUDIT THAT- I ACTUALLY ASKED FOR LAST YEAR THAT REVEALED THE- MISUSE OF FUNDS IN THOSE THREE COUNTIES AND IT WOULD IT HAPPENED ACTUALLY BECAUSE ADVOCATES- AN ENTITIES WITHIN THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAD BEEN ASKING FOR SIMILAR INFORMATION AND HAD BEEN UNABLE TO GET IT- I. DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE GOAL OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS TO MEASURE. COUNTIES AGAINST OTHER COUNTIES IT IS TO LOOK INDIVIDUALLY AT WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH IN EACH COUNTY AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING USED AND IF THEY ARE BEING USED IN A WAY THAT IS BEST MOST CONSTRUCTIVE AND MOST EFFECTIVE AND MOST EFFICIENT. WE CERTAINLY CAN'T YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T FIX WHAT WE CAN'T MEASURE- AND I WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE ASKING- TO BE WITHIN OUR JAIL SYSTEM- AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE DOING THE WORK THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO SO THAT'S- HOW I LOOK AT THIS BILL. I JUST LISTENING TO SOME OF THE TESTIMONY OF SOME OF THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION I ACTUALLY SEE THIS IS KIND OF BEING HIGHLY INDIVIDUALIZED PER COUNTY AND WOULD HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW- SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WOULD BE OPEN ABOUT. YOU KNOW THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THE KIND OF DATA- THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO COLLECT SO I'M AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D BE WILLING TO MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SENATOR OR CULTURAL BOOK. AT THE CHAIR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- KIND I HAVE A QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO SO- I REPRESENT THE SCRIPT THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO AND RIVERSIDE- AND I'M AS AS WELL AS LITTLE LITTLE PORTION OF LA.

I DO ARE WANT TO REITERATE MY GRATITUDE TO THIS COMMITTEE AND HELPING US TO FIND RECIDIVISM WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY CRITICAL SO. I INVITE THE SHERIFF TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH US. THANK YOU I'M AT THIS TIME I AID DUE TO CONCERNS THAT- MY COUNTY STAFF ON THIS ISSUE I. WILL BE STAYING OFF ON AND RESPECTIVELY STAYING OFF ON THIS BILL AT THIS TIME.

OF FACTS AS SOON CENTER COMMERCE'S YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU CAN'T MEASURE SHOW- COMPILING THIS DATA. WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE BANG FOR OUR BUCK I THINK MAKES SENSE WE ALL TALK ABOUT REHABILITATION WE ALL TALK ABOUT- ANTI RECIDIVISM SOUL IF YOU SEE IN YOUR PROGRAM TO WORK AND DEMONSTRATED THE PROOF IS IN THE BUTTON SO. IT SHOWS THE DOT AND THAT'S ALL THIS IS ASKING SIGN ACTUALLY GO BEYOND IN THE WERE YOU ARE TODAY JUST TELL US WHAT.

A TURBO DEVOTING COM LAGER I AM I RIGHT. WE'LL LEAVE THAT MEASURE ON CALL AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP IS TO OUR MEMBERS- ALL WE HAVE IS CALLED MISTER KALRA. THE RECOGNIZE YOUR VECTOR. HE'S PRESIDING A. B. TWO FIVE SIX. THE PODIUM GEORGE WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER CAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. DEAR MR SURE MEMBERS LAST YEAR THIS BODY TOOK A PROFOUND STEP FORWARD IN ADDRESSING INSTITUTIONALIZED AN IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS IN THE CRIMINAL COURTS BY EMPOWERING DEPENDENCE TO OBJECT TO CHARGES CONVICTIONS OR PUNISHMENTS. BASED UPON RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN BY PASSED THE CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. ADDITIONALLY THE ACT OVERTURNED A MORE THAN THIRTY YEAR LEGAL PRECEDENT ESTABLISHING THE CASE MCCLOSKEY WE CAN'T. KNOWN AS THE MCCLUSKY DECISION THE US SUPREME COURT HAD FOR TOO LONG REQUIRED CALIFORNIA QUEMADA PENDANTS IN CRIMINAL CASES TO PROVE INTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN CHALLENGING RACIAL BIAS IN THE LEGAL PROCESS. THIS INSISTENCE ON PROOF OF INTENTIONAL OR PURPOSEFUL DISCRIMINATION ESTABLISH A LEGAL STANDARD THAT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO ME. IN DISSENT JUSTICE WILLIAM BRENNAN WROTE BUT THE DECISION WAS DRIVEN BY A FEAR OF TOO MUCH JUSTICE. LAST YEAR'S AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY TO THE CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE ACT OVERTURNED THE MCCLOSKEY PRESIDENT AND ESTABLISH CALIFORNIA AS THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO PROHIBIT THE STATE FROM SEEKING OR OBTAINING A CRIMINAL CONVICTION OR FROM IMPOSING A SENTENCE BASED ON RACE. ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN IN ALL CASES. AB TWO FIFTY SIX IS THE NEXT STEP TOWARDS EQUAL JUSTICE ALLOWING THOSE WITH PAST JUDGMENTS RENDERED PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ABILITY TO USE THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ACT TO PETITION THE COURT TO SEEK POTENTIAL REMEDY INVOLVING RACIAL BIAS IN THEIR CASE. MAKING THE ACT AVAILABLE TO ALL IS NOT ONLY THE MORAL THING TO DO BUT IT IS ALSO ROOTED IN THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN SOME OF THE WORST RACIAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES IN THE COUNTRY. FOR A BLACK PERSON OVER EIGHT TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE INCARCERATED THAN A WHITE PERSON. THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST DISPARITIES IN THE COUNTRY FAR WORSE THAN ANY SOUTHERN STATE. BUT THE INTERDEPENDENCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED RATHER THAN TO BE ACQUITTED FOR OTHER CASES DISMISSED. BOTTLER DEFENDANTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE A FELONY VERSES A MISDEMEANOR CONVICTION. COMPARATIVELY DEPENDENCE BLACK MEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY OR 42% MORE LIKELY TO BE SENTENCED TO PRISON. FOR THE WHITE MAN CONVICTED OF A FELONY. THE MOBILE MAN CONVICTED OF UNDER 33% MORE LIKELY TO BE SENT TO PRISON. THE TROUBLE. TRIP IN CONCERT PEOPLE COLORED MUCH HIGHER RATES THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. NEEDS TO BE RECKONED WITH ON THE MECHANISM MECHANISM TO RETRACTABLE ROOF. AND THE CALIFORNIA RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO ALL THOSE PASSENGERS. WITH PASSENGERS THIS IS. ADDING RETROACTIVE RELIEF TO THE ACT AB TWO FIFTY SIX ALSO CONSIDER THE WORKLOAD CONCERNS FOR THE COURTS. BY SETTING A JUSTIFIED REASON FOR THOSE ABLE TO PETITION THE COURT FOR RETRO ACT WILL LEAVE USING THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL SINCE THE ACT'S IMPLEMENTATION. AND AB TWO FIFTY SIX REFLECTS TECHNICAL AND CLARIFYING CHANGES. COLLEAGUES THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT FOR ALL ANSWER THE SIMPLE QUESTION QUESTION. THE PROHIBITING RACISM AND OUR COURTS AND PROVIDING A PERSON A MEANS TO REMEDY RACIAL BIAS AND THEIR CASE IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO GOING FORWARD. SHOULD NOT BE THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF WHEN THE JUDGMENT WAS WANT RENDERED. TO ILLUSTRATE WHY WE NEED THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT FOR ALL YOU'LL HEAR FROM WITNESSES WITH FAMILY THERE ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES. OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. FOR WHICH RACE PLAYED A FACTOR IN. PERSON WOULD BE JULIE RODRIGUEZ BROTHERS WHO GO TRAVIS WAS CURRENTLY IMPRISONED. AND FIGHTING THE CASE OF A POWER COURT. AND ECONOMIC TERMS ON A MICHAEL MCCANN WAS ALSO CURRENTLY INCARCERATED. FOR PROSECUTORS ARE ABLE TO USE RACIAL UNDERTONES IN THE CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YOUR FIRST WITNESS MISS RODRIGUEZ. PAUL MY NAME IS JOE IT'LL BIGGEST BROTHER TWO ZERO TRAVIS I'M JUST ME CONVICTED AND SENTENCED TO MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS OF LIFE FOR A CRIME HE DID NOT COMMIT I WILL BE READING A STATEMENT FROM YOU DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY BANDARI DIDN'T DIRECTLY CALL ME BE YOUR LONG LIFE TRASH IMMIGRANTS OR ANY OTHER RACIAL SLURS. HE WAS ALLOWED TO DO WAS MUCH WORSE YOUR TACK MY UPBRINGING HISPANIC AMERICAN CULTURE HE PAINTED A PICTURE THAT PORTRAYED ME AND EVERYONE ELSE LIVES IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE I GREW UP AS CRIMINALS AT THE BEACH YOU GOT ALL OF THE MORE IMMIGRANTS IS ON AMERICAN WORKERS. MORE MOMENTS I REMEMBER CLEARLY IS WHEN I WAS ON THE STAND HE ASKED ME IF IT HAD BOTH PRISON GAME CONNECTING THE SPORTS ACTIVITY PLAYED BY MANY HISPANICS IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO CRIMINAL BEHAVIORS MY COMMUNITY. WILL CRIMINALIZE THE I'M A COMMUNITY YOUTH CENTER WITH THE TICKET AS A BREEDING GROUND FOR GANG MEMBERS ONE PARTICULAR OFFICER. USE AN EXPERT WITNESS FOR THE STATE. YOU KNOW WHAT HISPANIC. LOOKS LIKE CURRENTLY. LISTS ALL INCOME DISCRETE WITHIN TO MAKE A JUROR. FEAR FOR HER LIFE AS YOU RECALL. FOR RECURRING. IN THE AUDIENCE TO BE REMOVED. FROM THE COURTROOM IT'S A POSSIBLY BEING GANG MEMBERS BASED ON. AYE SHE SAID GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE DISH OF THE TESTIMONY AND WE CURRENT PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT BASED ON DESCRIPTIONS. OF WHAT GANG MEMBERS LOOK LIKE. LOOK POSSIBLY AS IF THEY'RE GANG MEMBERS AND IT MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE. THE RECURRING PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE IS GERMAN RECORDS TOO OR MY BROTHER'S ONLY A HARD WORKING FAMILY MAN. AND JOSE. IS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY ADVOCATE. SURE WHEN OFFICE SPACE HEY HAS BEEN PULLED BACK ON A DIFFERENT POPULATION AFTER CLAIMING TO HAVE LISTENED TO EVERYTHING THE ATTORNEYS AT THE STATE. THIS HAPPENED WITHIN THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF AN EIGHT MONTH LONG TRIAL. I DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE OBVIOUS RACIAL AND SOCIAL PREJUDICE THE COURTS A LOT OF MISTER PANDORA TWO PRESENTS THE JURY. THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION SOCIAL BIAS AND I DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO MENTION BUT I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE FOLLOWING. IT'S TIME WE MAKE POLICY THAT PROPELS MEANINGFUL CHANGE NOT FOR THE LEGISLATION THAT SUPPRESSES THE ISSUE OF THIS COUNTRY HAS SUFFERED. FOR MANY YEARS ONLY FOR IT TO RESURFACE CONTINUE. TO PLAGUE OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. I IN MY CASE THE COURT ROOM WHAT THE NATURE FOR RACIAL. AS PUBLIC OFFICERS WERE LOCKED STRATEGICALLY USE RACIAL PREJUDICE TWO APPEARANCES HIGHER. SOCIAL CLASS FOR THE PURPOSE OF GETTING A CONVICTION WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE LINKING. TO THE FACTS OF THE CRIME QUESTION THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF OUR CONSTITUTION PROHIBITS PROSECUTION BASED ON PREJUDICE. THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO APPLYING MY TRIAL DELAYS ARE TRUSTED PUBLIC FIGURES THAT REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THEY ARE THEY ARE IN A POSITION OF HIGH INFLUENCE OVER JERRY'S. UNCHECKED RACIAL AND SOCIAL PREJUDICE FROM THE DELAY IN LONG COURSE YOU GAIN EXPERTS DURING MY TRIAL LED. TO ME BEING FOUND GUILTY WE MUST DO OUR PART TO HAVE A SOCIETY THAT IS FREE OF RACIAL SOCIAL DISCRIMINATION. WE MUST FIND A REMEDY TO NOT ONLY CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR BOTH. ALSO PROVOKED- BOTH. WHAT FOR A BETTER FUTURE BUT ALSO CORRECT PAST WRONGS MAKING THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT RETROACTIVE THE BIG STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU THE NEXT WITNESS. MAKO. YES GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS INIGO THE MERGING ON AND IWILL BE READING A STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF MY SON WHO IS SERVING TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR SENTENCES FOR A CRIME COMMITTED WHEN THEY WERE JUST BLOWING. MY NAME IS MICHAEL THE MERGER AND I AM A HUMAN BEING pIN THIS WORLD. I HAD MADE A POOR CHOICE WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. WHICH I HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR THE LAST TWENTY ONE YEARS. IN PRISON. I'M NOT A MONSTER NOR EVIL. AT THE TIME HAS A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD KID I HAD LIED AND DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN MY CASE. BUT I HAD FALLEN TO A WORLD OF APPRECIATIVE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE ALL THEY WANTED WAS A CONVICTION. I'M BY NO MEANS RACES BUT THE TRUTH COMFORTABLE MY CASE DID NOT GIVE ME A FAIR TRIAL. STORAGE UNIT POOL OF MY PEERS. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE ALL GOD'S CHILDREN. A LOT OF PEOPLE FORGET THAT. AND LOOK AT THE SKIN COLOR BOTH VICTIMS IN MY CASES WERE WHITE. IT BREAKS MY HEART EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE MY FRIENDS. WE DID NOT SEE COLOR BUT IN COURT IT TURNED INTO A WHOLE DIFFERENT QUORUM. I'M A MIXED RACE AND HALF BLACK. MY OLD CASE WAS BASED ON LIES AND RACIALLY MOTIVATED TO GET THE CONVICTION. AND TRIAL PROSECUTOR CALLED MADE TERRORIST I CAN PROVE EVERYTHING BEING A FACT BECAUSE IT IS ALL IN MY TRANSCRIPT UNDOCUMENTED. EVEN HIRING ATTORNEYS COULD NOT STAND AGAINST MINES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. RACISM REALLY EXIST IN THE POWERFUL COURT SYSTEM WHICH HAS BARRICADED HIMSELF WITHIN ITSELF. TO ALLOW NO ONE TO GO AGAINST THEM WOOD SLICK WORDS AND LITTLE. THAT CAN BE MANIPULATED TO FAVOR. HI MICHAEL THE MERCHANT CAN HONESTLY SAY I DID NOT GET A FAIR TRIAL AND THE WILL TO DO IT OR DID. AND WAS RACIALLY DISCRIMINATED AGAINST. BOB GOES OUT ALONG WITH MY PRAYERS TO ALL PEOPLE ALONG WITH THE FAMILIES. THAT HAVE PULLED INTO BEING A VICTIM WILL CREATE CRIME. BUT THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE THAT MADE SOME WRONG CHOICES WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER AND THAT FORMER VICTIM PROPOSED TO HIS SYSTEM. OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND OVERLY HARSH TREATMENT ALONG WITH SENTENCES.

THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO WITNESS AN AWKWARD POSITION WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND WILL PROVIDE THEM- THREE MINUTES EACH WE HAVE LARRY MARSH AND WE OF COURSE SHOWS ALSO WHOSE ARE READY WE CAN BEGIN WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. LAST YEAR CDA VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED THE PASSAGE OF A. B. TWO FIVE FOUR TWO AND FOR MANY OF THE SAME REASONS- WE MUST ALSO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO FIVE SIX. DESPITE MYRIAD AMBIGUITIES UNANSWERED QUESTIONS POSED BY AB TWO FIVE FOUR TWO AB TWO FIVE SIX PROPOSES TO MAKE ITS PROVISIONS RETROACTIVE. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE PROPONENTS SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED RETROACTIVE APPLICATION LAST YEAR- WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S POLITICALLY UNPOPULAR. TO OPPOSE A BILL THAT HAS BESTOWED UPON ITSELF THE NAME THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT. BUT WE BELIEVE THE JUSTICE IT PURPORTS TO CREATE ILLUSORY AT BEST A MORE OPENLY COMPLICATE EFFORTS TO CREATE A FAIRER. AND MORE EQUITABLE JUSTICE SYSTEM- AB TWO BY FOUR IS EVERY CREATE A BOWL DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM A GOLD WHOLEHEARTEDLY EMBRACED BY CDA. BUT IT DID SO IN A WAY THAT CREATED A TREMENDOUS RISK OF DENYING JUST AS THE TWO VICTIMS OF EVERY RACE ETHNICITY AND NATIONAL ORIGIN BY INSTITUTING A SYSTEM THAT WOULD REVERSE A CASE. EVEN IF THERE WAS NO SHOWING THE DEFENDANT WAS DEPRIVED OF A FAIR TRIAL. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS A MASS SHOOTING AT A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER INVOLVED IN THE CASE. WHOSE ONLY ROLE WAS TO TAKE AN UNDISPUTED VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT FROM THE DEFENDANT. WHAT DISCOVERED TO HARBOR BIASES AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. THE BILL MANDATES THAT THE DEFENDANT'S CONVICTION WOULD HAVE TO BE REVERSED DESPITE THE FACT THAT FIFTY PEOPLE OBSERVE THE DEFENDANT SHOOTING OTHERS VICTIMS. THE WHAT THIS IS BIAS WAS REVEALED TO THE JURY. THE WITNESS COULD NOT EVEN TESTIFIED AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MURDERED ALONG THE SAME RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. AS THE DEFENSE. THAT RACIAL JUSTICE. AB TWO FIVE FOUR TWO WHICH AGAIN THIS BILL WOULD MAKE RETROACTIVE IS SIMPLY RENTAL WITH AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE INADEQUATE DEFINITIONS AND UNANSWERED LEGAL QUESTIONS THE BILL WOULD OVERTURN A CONVICTION OF THE DEFENDANT WAS CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF A MORE SERIOUS OFFENSE NOT THE FINE THE DEFENDANTS OF OTHER RACES ETHNICITIES OR NATIONAL ORIGIN WILL COMMIT SIMILAR OFFENSES NOT DEFINE AND ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED NOT THE FIVE. AND THE EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT THE PROSECUTION MORE FREQUENTLY SOUGHT VAGUELY DEFINED OR OBTAIN CONVICTIONS FOR MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES AGAINST PEOPLE WHO SHARE THE DEFENDANT'S RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL. ORIGIN COOLEY TROUBLING THE BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY GUIDANCE IN ASSESSING THE RELEVANCE FOR COMPARISON PERSON PURPOSES IT FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS AGO WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT QUALIFIES AS AN ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN AGAINST THE LAW IN THIS BILL PROVIDES ZERO GUIDE. SHOULD OFFENDERS CHARGED WITH THE SAME CRIMES TO BE OF THE SAME ETHNICITY BUT A DIFFERENT NATIONAL ORIGIN OR RACE OR BE OF THE SAME RACE BUT A DIFFERENT ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN. WHICH IS THE RELEVANT GROUP FOR COMPARISON NONE OF THESE COMPLEX ISSUES HAVE YET BEEN ADDRESSED BY AN APPELLATE COURT IN THIS BILL SEEKS TO MAKE IT RETROACTIVE. EVERY TO BELONGS TO AT LEAST TWO OR MORE RACIAL ETHNIC OR NATIONAL ORIGIN GROUPS. PRACTICALLY EVERY SINGLE CONVICTION THAT HAS EVER OCCURRED IN CALIFORNIA CAN NOW BE RE OPEN THE POTENTIALLY REVERSE. DESPITE INDEPENDENT NOT HAVING BEEN DENIED A FAIR TRIAL BY ANY REALISTIC STANDARD. HOW ABOUT PROVIDING THE COURTS AND TRYING TO OUR IRON OUT THE MULTITUDE OF LEGAL ISSUES RAISED BY THE BILL LET'S DETERMINE THE ACTUAL COST OF THE NEW LAWS ENACTED BY AB TWO FIVE FOUR TWO IN A POST OPEN COURT WORLD. BEFORE MAKING IT RETROACTIVE. EITHERIMMEDIATELY TO ALL PERSONS CURRENTLY SERVING A SENTENCE STATE PRISON OR THE COUNTY JAIL. LET'S GET A HANDLE ON THE SIGNIFICANT COST AND LEGAL ISSUES BEFORE MANDATING GETS RETROACTIVELY AND YOU OF ALL THESE FACTORS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU TO MENTION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERSE CHORUS A LITTLE BEHALF OF CAL STATE SURE ASSOCIATION- I THINK MISTER MORRIS LAID OUT A LOT OF THE POLICY BASED CONCERNS THAT WE SHARE WITH AB TWO FIFTY SIX WE CERTAINLY DON'T DEFEND DISCRIMINATION. BASED ON THE FACTORS NOTED IN THE BILL OR ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT SAID THIS BILL IN ITS PREDECESSOR GO FAR BEYOND ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT OR REMEDY DECISIONS AND OUTCOMES THAT ARE ALLEGED TO BE A FACTOR OF RACE ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN I WOULD JUST SIMPLY HIGHLIGHT- IN ADDITION TO THE POINT THAT MISTER MORRIS MADE AGAIN- THAT AB TWO FIFTY SIX. DESPITE THE- PURPOSEFUL ACTION. REGARDING THE BILL LAST YEAR TO MAKE IT PERSPECTIVES CAN REACH ONLY- IS NOW JUST MONTHS LATER NOT BEING MADE TO BE RETROACTIVE- AND WE EXPECT THAT AB TWO FIFTY SIX WILL ONLY FURTHER AGGRAVATE THOSE EXPECTED SPIKES IN COURT CASELOAD RESULTING FROM AB TWENTY FIVE FORTY TWO DELAYING OR DENYING JUSTICE TO OTHERS WHO SEEK IT SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWO FIFTY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO THE ROOM THERE ARE THERE WITNESSES HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. OF A AB TWO FIVE SIX. TWO NINE WILL GO TO OUR OVER FORMER TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL. MODERATE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES AND SHIFTERS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO FIVE SIX. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO FIVE SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CARE WE HAVE NO IN QUEUING UP AT THIS TIME. OKAY WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS BY COMMITTEE. NO. I'M SORRY. I WOULD MAKE IS IF WE HAD ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS I COMMITTEE- I WOULD JUST WANT TO THANK A CINNAMON FOR BRINGING THIS ROGER FORD I'M ALWAYS BLOWN AWAY AT THE ARGUMENT THAT RACE PLAYS NO PART AND MUCH OF WHAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM DOES ON A DAILY BASIS- BUT IT'S LAUGHABLE- HISTORY IS PROVEN IN THAT RACE PLAYS AS MUCH OF A PART SOME TIMES ONCE GUILT OR INNOCENCE SPECIALLY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND SPECIALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INCARCERATED IN THIS COUNTRY AND IF I COULD QUOTE A RICHARD PRYOR- OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS JUST THAT JUST US JUST BLACK AND BROWN FOLKS WHO ARE CONVICTED THE MOST HARSHLY AND SENT TO PRISON ALL THE TIME CHAU DISK SAY AND THEN THE EXAMPLE THAT MISS MORRIS MISSED MORE SHOES AS A MASS SHOOTING OF FIFTY PEOPLE OF THE SAME RACE. THE MILITARY NO BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE HAVE COMMITTED ANY SUCH ACT IN THIS COUNTRY SO- THAT'S A POOR EXAMPLE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED CHAU- UNTIL YOU CAN SHOW ME A CASE WHERE BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE. HAVE KILLED MASS SHOOTINGS AND- THAT WOULD GOOD ENOUGH. ON THAT NOTE. I WILL ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE MISTER CAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MATURE FOR. YOUR OWN WISDOM IN YOUR SUPPORT- THESE YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO SAY. OF COURSE WE BELIEVE ANYBODY NEED TO GET RID OF THIS COMBINATION IS MORE DIFFICULTTO DO IT. AND THIS ACT OF BLUE THE RACIAL JUSTICE ACT INCLUDING THIS BILL WHICH ALLOWS FOR A PHASED IN RETROACTIVITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE- THE WORKLOAD CONCERNS- IS THE DIFFICULT WORK THAT ALL OF US ARE TASKED TO DO. AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE OF THE OPPOSITION PARTICULARLY OUR- FRIENDS OVER THE DISK ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. TO ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THIS IN A WAY. THAT ACTUALLY ACHIEVES JUSTICE. S. THEIR CONCERN ARE ARE K. THAT ARE ON THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO HELP. TO FURTHER DEFINE- OF THE LEGISLATION ANY PEACE LANDMARK LEGISLATION OR POOR COURT PRECEDENT REQUIRES FURTHER ANALYSIS FROM THE COURTS NUMBER AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEN THAT. IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD BUT IN THE MEANTIME RETROACTIVITY INSURERS THAT- THAT WE ARE. APPLYING THIS MORAL JUSTICE TO EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN IMPACTED IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS ON THANK YOU MISTER. AS WELL AS OF THE WITNESSES I SPOKE ON THE PHONE SHARING STORIES OF THOSE IMPACTED. THE OVER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SIMILAR THEIR SUPPORT. AND TORE AB TWO FIFTY SIX SPONSORS. VERY GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SUPPORT RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I BOUGHT. WE HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO APPROACH WE'RE LOOKING FOR MOTION. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER COM LOGGER. CANCEL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB TWO FIVE SIX. AB TWO FIVE SIX BRADFORD HI READ FOR DIETRO BOGE. TURBO NO COM LONGER HI I'M LONGER AYE SKINNER WINNERS. ASSEMBLY POWER WILL LEAD ROLE OPEN FOR THOSE APPS MEMBERS TO ADD ON. THANK YOU THE RETURN THANK YOU NEXT UP IS. THROUGH WE ARE NOT SURE. MCCARTY OKAY YES- WE HAVE AB. FIFTEEN FORTY TWO. WE ARE FIFTEEN FORTY TO BUY US A MOMENT I'M CARD WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU MAY TESTIFY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR WORKING WITH US AND TALKING TO US ABOUT THIS BILL. IT SAY- THE BILL HAS QUITE A BIT OF A MOTION I KNOW ON BOTH SIDES BUT IN REALITY IT'S A- IT'S A DISTRICT BILL IT'S A PILOT PROJECT FOR MY COUNTY WHICH SHOULD BE HELD IN YOLO COUNTY WHICH I. SHARE WITH- CENTERS PAN AND DODD IN THIS SIDE OVER HERE- THIS IS HOW THE SUNSET FOR FIVE YEARS TO TEST OUT AN IDEA THAT WE KNOW IS A BIG THING IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TOO MANY PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT THROUGH THE SYSTEM. WITH UNDERLYING DRUG ADDICTIONS AND NEVER EVER HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO GET TREATMENT I THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION ABOUT THIS BILL AND IF THE BILL REALLY DID WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS CLAIMING I WOULD NOT TO THE BILL I WOULD NOT BOTHER IT AND FRANKLY I'D VOTE AGAINST IT BUT IT'S NOT- THAT- THIS BILL CREATES A VOLUNTARY WAY FOR INDIVIDUALS. TO HAVE AN UNDERLYING DRUG ADDICTION. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN SENTENCED. TO EITHER A STATE PRISON TERM OR LONG TERM- TERM IN COUNTY JAIL. TO SEEK TREATMENT INSTEAD IN LIEU OF. THIS IS A 100% INVOLUNTARY. IT WOULD BE BASED ON RECOMMENDATIONS FROM HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS- NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE JUDGE. THE JUDGE COULD APPROVE IT IF THE DA AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PROVIDE A RECOMMENDATION THAT THIS COULD BENEFIT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN SENTENCED. AND AGAIN IT'S VOLUNTARY. INDIVIDUAL GOES DOWN THIS ROUTE. AND DOESN'T- I THINK IT'S A GOOD FIT THEY CAN BACK OUT BUT WHEN THEY BACK OUT. JUST BE CLEAR BUT NOT GOING TO GO HOME THE NICKEL BRACELET THEY'RE GONNA GO EITHER GO. TO THEY'RE SENTENCED TO STATE PRISON OR IN COUNTY JAIL. SO THAT YOU KNOW. SHOULD OF PERFECT WORLD WE'D LIKE MORE COMMUNITY TREATMENT. FOR INDIVIDUALS. IT FOR DRUG TREATMENT IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT I WOULD BE GOING OTHERWISE TO RETURN- INCARCERATED AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT GOOD TREATMENT FRANKLY YOU CAN GET DRUGS EASILY AND- AND ART AND ART IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ANYWAY. SO THIS IS A CHANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO. A SECURED FACILITY TO FOCUS ON TREATMENT ONCE THE TREATMENT IS COMPLETED. THEY WILL HAVE THEIR FELONY RECORD EXPUNGED IN BE ABLE TO. MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO TRY. NEW THINGS IN CALIFORNIA THE CURRENT SYSTEM ABOUT ADDICTION AND INCARCERATION IS NOT WORKING. AND I WOULD ASK THAT WE GIVE THIS- PILOT PROJECT IN YOLO COUNTY. I TRIED FOR FIVE YEARS I WITH ME TODAY. OUR OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM YELLOW COUNTY JEFF REISIG. AS WELL AS HIS- DEPUTY IS IN THE AUDIENCE WITH US AS WELL. AND ANTHONY BROWN. I ASK THE ARRIVAL MISTER CHAIR. PART HERE FOR MR IT WILL GIVE THE WITNESSES SUPPORT MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS THIS CONCERNING JEFF REISIG OF YELLOW COUNTY. YOU MANY PEOPLE WHO SUFFER FROM SERIOUS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS ARE GOING TO PRISONS AND JAILS FOR CRIMES THAT ARE MOTIVATED BY THEIR ADDICTION. BRITAIN'S IN JAILS ARE SIMPLY NOT PLACES WHERE SICK PEOPLE GO TO GET BETTER. AND AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY MENTIONED. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CALIFORNIA ON THESE ISSUES ISN'T. WORKING OUT AS WELL AS WE WOULD HOPE AND WE HAVE A REVOLVING DOOR. AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO PROPOSAL LOCAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO PRISON AND JAIL. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY LEVEL CRIMES MOTIVATED BY THEIR SERIOUS ADDICTION TO DRUGS. BUT WHO POSED TO MUCH OF A RISK FOR A JUDGE TO SIMPLY RELEASE THEM INTO A UNSECURED RESIDENTIAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY. WHERE THEY CAN SIMPLY WALK AWAY. OR CRAWL OUT A WINDOW ON DAY ONE AND POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE HARM TO THEMSELVES. OR OTHERS CHAU INSTEAD AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO ENVISIONS CREATING A SECURE. DIGITAL LIKE TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT WITHOUT JAILS AND BARS AND GUARDS AND GUNS THAT CAN SERVE AS A SANCTUARY BERSERK SERIOUSLY ADDICTED FELONY OFFENDERS. WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO TRY LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED TREATMENT. AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES IN THE CITY CONCERT YOU'RE SITTING RIGHT HERE AT HOME IN YELLOW INSTEAD OF BEING MERELY BE IN WAREHOUSE. HIND BARS- WE CALL THIS POTENTIAL PLACE HOPE YELLOW. WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE UNIQUE IS THAT IT WILL BE DESIGNED AND STAFFED BY TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHO'S AN APPROPRIATE CANDIDATE AND WHO IS NOT AND WHAT THE TREATMENT SHOULD LOOK LIKE. FOR THOSE WHO DO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE TREATMENT. OVER PRISON THEY WILL HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED AND THEY'LL GET A CLEAN START RIGHT HERE AT HOME. ULTIMATELY AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO. REMEASURED PILOT BILL ANNUAL CHARITY THAT IS DESIGNED TO OFFER. EARLY VOLUNTARY TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES TO THAT THOSE WHO ARE OTHERWISE ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON OR JAIL.

YES MA'AM I'M HERE. PLEASE PROCEED- THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON TRACY OLSON THE YELLOW COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER WAS GOING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION BUT HAVE RUN INTO SOME OBSTACLES MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON I AM A RETIRED CHIEF DEFENDER OF SOLANO COUNTY AND REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ON BEHALF OF OUR ASSOCIATION I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT DEEP CONCERNS ABOUT AB FIFTEEN FORTY TWO FIRST THIS BILL INCENTIVIZES THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO SEEK AND JUDGES TO APPROVE AND IMPOSE A PRISON SENTENCE IN ORDER TO REQUIRE OUR CLIENTS TO RECEIVE TREATMENT. WE KNOW WHAT THE PIT THAT THE CATCH IS THAT THESE CLIENTS WOULD GO TO PRISON ANYWAY. I WOULDN'T TREATMENT FEATHER. AT THE VERY MAJORITY OF CASES ARE SETTLED THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS PROSECUTORS HAVE BROAD DISCRETION AS TO HOW THE SHUTTLE CHASE. YES JUDGES MAKE THE ORDERS BUT IN REALITY THE JUDGES ARE OFTEN JUST APPROVING LAUGHTER FROM THE PROSECUTION AND ACCEPTED BY THE DEFENDANT. THE BILL BANKS ON THE IDEA THAT WHEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PRISON AND TREATMENT THE CLIENT WOULD QUOTE UNQUOTE SHOES TREATMENT. THERE WILL INCREASES AND CREATES A SYSTEM BY WHICH PROSECUTORS AND- CONSCIOUSLY OR NOT WILL MAKE PRISON MONSTERS THEY WOULD NOT NORMALLY MAKE JUST TO GIVE OUR CLIENTS TO AS I SAID QUOTE UNQUOTE SHOES TREATMENT. THAT IS A BROKEN SYSTEM CHECK IT. THE BILL HAS NO PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE OUR CLIENTS WON'T SERVE MORE JAIL CUSTODY TIME AND TIME ON PROBATION IF THEY PARTICIPATE IN TREATMENT SECTION THREE TWO ALLOWS THE CLIENT COULD BE IN A LOCKED FACILITY AND UNDERSTOOD PROVISIONAL LONGER. THAN THE ACTUAL SENTENCE IMPOSE. WE ARE NOT A DAHLE OPPOSED TO OFFERING TREATMENT SERVICES TO OUR CLIENTS BUT WE MUST DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT INCENTIVIZE PRISON SENTENCES AND DOES NOT LINK THAN DEFENDANTS STAYS IN JAIL OR PUREED THE PROBATION SUPERVISION. YELLOW COUNTY JAIL HAS UNDERGONE A MAJOR REMODEL AND NOW HAVE DEDICATED SPACE TO PROVIDE TREATMENT. SERVICES TO BEGIN LATE. AND HAD ALL BEEN TO EMBED SERVICES IN THE JAIL AND THEN TRANSITION PEOPLE BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE UNDER THE- PROPOSED LAW. WE APPRECIATE THE INCREASED DIGNITY RECOGNITION AND THE NEED FOR TREATMENT AND TO TREAT THIS DISORDER OF THE MEDICAL TECHNICIAN. BUT FIFTEEN FORTY TWO AS WRITTEN DESERVES YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT YOU'RE LOOKING JAIL ALREADY HAVE AN INCOME SEPT YOU FROM PROGRAM.

THAT CAN MENTION A COMMUNITY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SYSTEM AND NETWORK OF CARE. UNDER DRUG MEDI CAL FOR DRUGS FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. I DID MEDICAL RESEARCH TO PAY CORPS.

ONCE AGAIN THE DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL LEADERS COULD NOT REFUSE IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF EVIDENCE AND EQUITY. DEVELOPED BY A BROAD SET OF NATIONAL EXPERTISE STAKEHOLDERS IT WOULD BE A PAINFUL IRONY THAT WHILE IT'S HARD TO THE NET MULTISTATE OPIOID LAWSUIT WALKED FREE. THE OUTCOME OF THAT CASE RESULT IN LOCKING UP SOME OF THEIR VICTIMS THE DRUG OVERDOSE CRISIS IS URGENT WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO EXPAND CARE TO MEET THE MOMENT.

THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK THE AUTHOR BERMAN IS A KNOWLEDGE THIS IS- IT'S A THIS IS A POKER SITUATION- A LOT OF MY I DO A LOT OF TIME OF DRUG POLICY WORK AND A LOT OF MY- FRIENDS HER OPPOSING THIS BILL IN TERMS OF INCLUDING A LOT OF AMAZING ADVOCATES AND- IN MY OWN COMMUNITY AND WHEN I FIRST. CAME UPON THIS BILL I- HERE I CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS TAKING US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION IN TERMS OF HOW WE TREAT SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I STILL HAVE. THOSE CONCERNS. AND I JUST WANNA SERVICES CITY THAT UNKNOWN THAT- SO ROSA CALIFORNIA BACK MY HEAD SERRANO. BUT WE SHOULD NEVER BE LOOKING AT OURSELVES AND- AND THE MONARCHS- BUT I ALSO KNOW. THAT WE HAVE SO MANY. CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITIES AROUND THE INTERACTIONS OF DRUG USE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- AND WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR A LONG TIME CENTER BALLOTS SOME BILLS IN THIS. ONE WHEN DRUGS ARE INTERACTING WITH SOMEONE COMMISSION OF A CRIME HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT IN A WAY THAT'S NOT. SIMPLY PUNITIVE IN A WAY IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE THE HELP THAT THEY- THEY NEED- I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW- THIS AUTHOR- IT IS SOMEONE WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST PROGRESSIVE VOICES IN THE LEGISLATURE ON. CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES I WAS PROPOSING OUT LIMITED PILOT PROGRAM FOR COUNTY AND IS DISTRICT AND. ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK. I'D LIKE TO SHOW. WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO THE PILOT PROGRAMS FOR THEIR OWN COMMUNITY THAT THEY KNOW BEST- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL DIFFERENCE THERE DODD TO BE HONEST- FIVE. YOU KNOW I WILL ALSO JUST SAY THAT I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONTINUING QUESTIONS ABOUT. THIS BILL- AND I WANNA MAKE SURE FOR SO THAT I UNDERSTAND SOME THINGS AND I THINK THIS BILL. NEEDS MORE WORK- SO YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE. AND NOT HARMFUL ONE THING I ALSO NEGLECTED TO MENTION WHEN I FIRST YOU KNOW POSITIVE FORM SOME OF THE CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL I WENT BACK AND LOOKED AT THE ASSEMBLY FLORIDA AND FOUND THAT- BUT PRETTY MUCH ALMOST EVERY SINGLE. DEMOCRAT IN THE ASSEMBLY INCLUDING SOME VERY VERY PROGRESSIVE LEADERS ON THESE ISSUES VOTED FOR THE BILL AND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE SEVERAL TAKE A HARDER LOOK- AT THE BILL. SO I GUESS IT'S JUST A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS- FOR THE- FOR THE AUTHOR. THERE WAS A COMMENT- EARLIER ABOUT HEALTH I THINK FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S ASSOCIATION. THAT THIS COULD LEAD TO SOMEONE HAVING A LONGER. PERIOD OF TIME IN A LOCKED FACILITY. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE JUST BY THE PRISON SENTENCE. I MIGHT I MIGHT BE MISREADING THE BILL PUT UP MY UNDERSTANDING WAS DIED THE BILL SPECIFICALLY SAYS AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IF IT DOESN'T I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE- OF THE LOCK TREATMENT PLUS TO STEP DOWN. CAN NOT EXCEED. V. WHAT THE PRISON SENTENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN- AND I IN ADDITION. IF A PERSON DECIDES TO LEAVE TREATMENT AND GO BACK GO AND GO INTO A PRISON SETTING. THE TOTAL AMOUNT CAN'T EXCEED. THAT SENT OKAY YOU CLARIFY THAT TIME FOR ME BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T. IF YOU CHOOSE THIS OPTION IF THEY DON'T END UP SPENDING MORE TIME. THAN THEY WOULD HAVE HAD THEY SIMPLY- ACCEPTED THE-JAILER PRISON SONS. THANK YOU- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE BACK AND FORTH HERE AND I'D LIKE TO GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ON THIS YOU KNOW AS THAT THE CHAIR ALLOWS US TO- BUT YEAH THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE BILL WHEN WE HIT WE INTRODUCED IT AND WE TOOK AN AMENDMENT. IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT CLARIFIES THAT SO. I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS AND SO IF WE CAN FURTHER CLARIFY THAT POINT. I'M WILLING TO DO SO BUT I THINK WE'RE CLEAR. THAT THE INDIVIDUALS- THAT TIME IN IN THIS IN THE TREATMENT WOULD WOULD NOT. EXCEED WHAT THEY WOULD GET THROUGH THEIR UNDERLYING SENTENCE. INDOOR PROBATION OKAY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO DIE. IF THERE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED TO THE BILL. TO PUT GUARDRAILS- IN PLACE. THAT THAT YOU'LL DO THAT ABSOLUTELY AND I ALSO IN TERMS OF- I. ZERO SOMETIMES P. GET RELEASED BECAUSE OF- CREDITS FOR. GOOD BEHAVIOR OTHER KINDS OF CREDITS THAT THEY RECEIVED TO THEIR THEIR SENTENCES LET'S SAY TEN YEARS BUT BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CREDITS ARE ABLE TO BE RELEASED IN SEVEN YEARS- AND I. WOULD ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE AND AGAIN IT'S A LITTLE THEORETICAL BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT INCARCERATED- BY YOU KNOW YOU OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE TO THOSE CREDITS I AM I WOULD ASK THAT YOU EXPLORE HELD MAYBE. DOT CONCEPTS- COULD BE INCORPORATED BECAUSE RIGHT NOW I THINK IT'S DRAFTED AS WHAT THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE CAN BE AND WE KNOW THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T SERVE THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE- THEY SERVE SOMETHING LESS THAN THAT- OF BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH BECAUSE CREDITS OR WHATEVER ELSE- AND I WOULD LIKE LIKE TO SEE THE BILL INCORPORATE. THAT POSSIBILITY SO THEY'RE NOT SO THE DOG TOPPED THE YOU'RE GONNA PUT IF NEEDED GUARD ROSEN FOR HIS AUTOMATICALLY INTO THE HIGH RANGE OF THE SENTENCE I KNOW IT'S COMPLICATED- ADAM I KNOW WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT- BUT I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT. BOMBING CORPORATE ED- INTO YOU OPEN THE LOCK COVERS. YEAH JUST ON THAT IT AND I DO THE I'M NOT SURE FOR D. A. STILL ON THE LINE WE HAVE OUR DEPUTY YOLO COUNTY CHIEF DEPUTY JONATHAN RAVEN HERE COULD CLARIFY MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S A KIND OF A SWEET SPOT OF WHO WOULD. WHO WOULD PARTICIPATE IN THIS IS A NOT MISDEMEANORS. THESE ARE NOT SERIOUS CRIMES AND FELONIES SO THESE AREN'T YOUR LONGER SENTENCES. SO THE SHORTER SENTENCES ANYWAY JUST BY THE FACT OF THE TIME THEY ARE. THE DURATION OF THE OF THE TREATMENT. IT WOULDN'T BE THE E. WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY GET CREDITS AND HAVE A LOWER SPENT TIME IS THAT CORRECT. MYSTERY THAT IS CORRECT AND- I THINK YEAH BOTH THE OR RIGHT ON- BY OPERATIONAL LOG THE THIS POPULATION WOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CUSTODY EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE IN. A RESIDENCE- BUT THEY CAN'T LEAVE OF COURSE- AND SO BY OPERATION F LAW THEY WOULD STILL GET ALL THEIR CREDITS AND I BELIEVE FOR THE AUTHOR THAT IS CERTAINLY THE INTENT. THAT THEY DO KNOW MORE TIME THAN THEY WOULD DO IF THEY WERE IN CUSTODY- AND CREDITS WOULD COUNT IN THAT REGARD AND HOW HELLO THE CREDITS BE DETERMINED IF YOU'RE A NEW TREATMENT SETTING AS OPPOSED TO A CARCERAL SETTING. EXACTLY THE SAME BUT IF YOU THAT IF YOU'RE COMPLYING WITH THE TREE MAN AND- AND NOT HAVING VIOLATIONS THAN YOU GET CREDITS THAT REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU WOULD SPEND IN THE TREATMENT SETTING I THINK IF YOU'RE IN THE SECURE TREATMENT SETTING NO MATTER WHAT. YOU WOULD GET THE CREDITS I MEAN BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IN JAIL- IT YOU DON'T GET CREDITS FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR YOU GET AUTOMATIC CREDITS SO SIMILAR THAT IF YOU WERE IN THE SECURE. TREATMENT FACILITY YOU WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GET CREDITS. IRWIN I DEFECT CLARIFIED- THE OTHER COUNTIES IN TERMS OF THE SENTENCE BECAUSE SOMETIMES. YOU MAY MAYBE YOUR IT'S A FELONY FOR AUTO BURGLARY BUSES PICK ONE OF THE FELONY AUTO BURGLARY. FACT THAT COULD QUALIFY- SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE PRIORS TO THE END UP HAVING. ENHANCEMENTS OR OTHER THINGS SO- IN TERMS OF FAN AND I I'VE I SHOULD'VE GONE BACK AND LOOKED. AT THIS BEFORE- BUT IN TERMS. WHEN WE SAY OKAY HAVE TO SPEND AMOUNT OF TIME ENTRY. BOB IS AT THE BASE SENTENCE OR IS IT- BASINS PLUS ANY ENHANCEMENTS. TO INCLUDE ENHANCEMENTS HI- I WOULD MY TAKE ON A IS THAT THEY SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE BAY SENTENCE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ENHANCEMENTS ARE. AND WE SHOULD BE GETTING RID OF A LOT OF OUR ANNOUNCEMENTS I THINK AND YOU MAY DISAGREE WITH ME ON THIS I THINK ENHANCEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ATROCIOUS AND DATE AND UP TURNING. WHAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE SENTENCE FOR- YOU KNOW FOR NONVIOLENT FELONY INTO SOMETHING MUCH MUCH GREATER- AND SO I WOULD REQUEST THAT THIS BE LIMITED TO. THE BASE CENTER AND SEN AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT MAYBE LIKE WHAT WOULD BE LIKE SAY A TWO YEAR SENTENCE IT TURNS INTO A SEVEN OR EIGHT YEAR SENTENCE- YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF SAYING YOU HAVE TO SOMEONE HAVE TO AGREE TO A YEAR'S WORTH OF. DRUG TREATMENT- IS ARRIVING COULD GET ON REASONABLE AND SO I'D LIKE TO SEE A GUARD RAIL AND- THAT. IT'S OF A SHORTER YOU KNOW THE BAY SENTENCE OR SOMETHING THAT'S NOT JUST. LEAVING SOMEONE IN FOR A LONG TIME AND I SAY ALL THIS SO I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT MOVING THE SENATE COMMITTEE TODAY. I'M BECAUSE I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS OPERATING IN GOOD FAITH THAT I KNOW WERE. WORKERS VALUES LIE IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM- BUT I I'M GONNA WANT TO LOOK AT THIS WHEN IT COMES BACK ON THE FLOOR- AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO PUT OUT THERE THAT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT. FOR ME TO SEE GUARDRAILS AROUND MAKING SURE THIS DOESN'T GO ON. FOREVER NEVER BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN PROBABLY IN THE SUMMER COMING FROM. YOUR OWN STATE AUTO BURGLARY FELONY THAT WAS DRUG RELATED MAYBE THE PERSON DOES HAVE A HISTORY- BUT IT TURNS OUT TO YOUR SENSE INTO SOME MUCH LONGER SENTENCE. THAT MIGHT BE AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME. FOR DRUG TREATMENT SO IS THAT SOMETHING THEY ARE. OPEN TO. WORKING ON OKAY- THE- HI PLEASE SEND MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME IN THIS IS YOU KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT- DISCUSSION- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE JUDGE. AND THE JUDGE AB ONE OF THE CONCERNS THE OPPOSITION HAS EXPRESSED WHICH I UNDER I AGREE WITH THEM AND I THINK THE BILL. ADDRESSES OUT BUT MAYBE IT CAN BE CLEAR. IS THAT JUDGES SHOULD BE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE. SERVE FORMULATING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AS NOT A JUDGE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT BE AN EXPERT IN THE AREA. I THINK THE BILL HAS LANGUAGE THAT THE JUDGE'S DETERMINATION IS BOUNDED BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN YOU JUST COMMENT ON- EITHER THE AUTHOR OR THE WITNESS ABOUT WHAT HEALTH. STRESS HOW HOW RIGID THAT BOUNDING IS BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR JUDGE. NOT TO BE ABLE TO GO BEYOND WHAT THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE RECOMMENDING. BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THE THAT THE JUDGE WILL BE A PLEA. FOR GOES TO COURT THERE WILL BE A JUDGMENT. AND SO AFTER THAT THEN THE DA. WORKING WITH THAT THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS COULD COME BACK AND SAY BEFORE THIS INDIVIDUAL GOES IN SEARCH OR SENTENCE HERE'S ANOTHER OPTION FOR YOU SO IT'S AFTER THE FACT AND- YOU WANNA CLARIFY MYSTERY MARK YET SO. SENATOR TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT- WE ALSO DON'T WANT JUDGES MAKING THAT CALL- WE WANT TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO MAKE THAT CALL AND- MAKE THE ASSESSMENT. AND MAKE TE RECOMMENDATION TO THE-JUDGE WE DON'T WANT JUDICIAL ACTIVISM- WE DON'T WANT JUDGES MAKING THE DECISION- THAT MAY MAKE SOME JUDGES UNCOMFORTABLE BUT IN THIS CASE WE WANT TO BE IRON CLAD WE WANT THE LEVEL- AND HEAD OF TREATMENT- TO BE BASED ON. THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE EXPERTS THE HEALTH CARE. ACTIVATORS I'D LIKE TO BECOME MORE WHICH IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS REALLY CHRIS CRYSTAL CLEAR IN THE BILL AND JUST TO MUCH TWO MORE QUICK THINGS IF- LET'S SAY THE PERSON'S JAIL SENTENCE- IS FIVE YEARS AND SAID THAT THEY AND THEY OPT FOR THE RESIDENTIAL OR THIS BLOCK TREATMENT AND LET'S SAY AFTER TWO AND A HALF FOR THREE YEARS. IT THE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TURN THIS PERSON HAS. LIKE TO HEAD OUT OF THE BALLPARK AND IS LIKE JUST DOING SO GREAT- WE CAN THIS PERSON HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED- OF DRUG. TREATMENT OR REHABILITATION. IS A PERSON HAVE TO THEN SERVE THE REST OF THE TIME IN PRISON OR COULD THE PERSON BE RELEASED BEFORE THE END OF THE PRISON TERM YES THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER AND FIRST OFF ON A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE THAT INDIVIDUAL LONG BEACH SERVING HALF THAT TIME RIGHT BUT- WE DON'T ENVISION SOMEONE SPENDING A YEAR TWO YEARS THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS IN A TREATMENT FACILITY- IF IT YOU KNOW IT WOULD PROBABLY BE- MUCH LESS TIME. THAT THEY WOULD- GET BETTER AND THEN BASED ON ASSESSMENT BY THE HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS- ONCE THEY DECIDE THAT THEY NO LONGER NEED TO BE THERE THEN THEN THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ALSO SHOULDN'T BE IN A RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY THEY DON'T NEED INPATIENT AND THAT THAT WOULDN'T BE FOR THEM EITHER YOU DON'T WANT A HIGHER LEVEL OF CLEAR YOU WANT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CARE. AND IN THIS CASE OF SOMEONE- HIT OUT OF THE PARK AS YOU SAY AND GOT WELL THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH THEIR SENTENCE AND BE DONE AND HAVE THEIR CASE- THEIR CONVICTION EXPUNGED WHEN YOU SAY FINANCES SOUNDS WHAT DO YOU MEAN. AB OUT OF CUSTODY OUT OF ANY TYPE OF CUSTOMER. SO IF THEY'RE SENTENCED TO FIVE YEARS FOR THE SENTENCES FIVE YEARS THEY OPT FOR THIS ALTERNATIVE. AND THEN AFTER NINE MONTHS. OF TWO OF TWO OF THETREATMENT. THEIR DECLARED LIKE YOU YOU'VE SUCCEEDED. RELATED TO HIM MAYBE THREE MORE MONTHS IN A STEP DOWN FACILITY. SO THAT WOULD BE A YEAR. THAN THEY WOULD BE OUT-OF CUSTODY IN ONE YEAR AND SET UP A FIVE YEAR SENTENCE CORRECT. OKAY. OKAY AND I THINK MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE JUST AGAIN MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS A CLEAR. AND IT'S HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE DETERMINING WHETHER THE PERSON IS SUCCESSFULLY- HAS SIX HAS SUCCEEDED ABSOLUTELY BAPPA FINALS WHO WHICH HEALTH. WHO IN PARTICULAR MAKES A FINAL DECISION. IT WOULD PROBABLY BE- TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN YOUR COUNTY OKAY. I'M GONNA THAT'S ANOTHER ONE. WANT TO GO BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT. IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH FINALLY I WANT TO SAY ONE THING I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS. IS THAT WHEN THE PERSON SUCCESSFULLY. COMPLETES THE PROGRAM. THEIR CONVICTION NOT JUST A CONVICTION BUT I THINK THEIR ENTIRE RECORD. OF FOR THIS PARTICULAR CRIME IS COMPLETELY X. IS EXPUNGED. AUTOMATICALLY I THINK IT'S. OF THE JUDGE. SHALL DO THE- AND- AND THEN THE JUDGE HAS THIS. TO GO BACK. AND EXPLAINS PREVIOUS DRUG CONVICTIONS ON RELATED TO THE CURRENT ONE- SO THAT'S A POSITIVE IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE. BACK ON TRACK WHERE IS IF YOU JUST COMPLETE YOUR CONVICTION AND YUNIS'S YOUR JAIL SENTENCE YOU KNOW EXPANSION IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC THING BY ANY STRETCH OF THE IMAGINATION SO- ANYWAY I THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THE AUTHOR AND THE WINDOWS- I THINK SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED IN THE BILL SOME OF THEM MIGHT BE NEED TO BE. PUBLIC CLARIFIED AND MAYBE WE COULD EVEN WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WITH THE CHAIR- ON SOME OF THESE CLARIFYING AND MAINTAINING AMENDMENTS- AND WITH THAT I'LL BE SUPPORTING MOVING THIS BILL. FORWARD- TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR WARNER CENTER COME ON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR ASKING- A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT I TO- WAS THINKING ABOUT I HAVE TO SAY WHEN I. WAS READING THIS BILL AND I JOKE WITH THE AUTHOR- YOU KNOW IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST WHICH- IS NOT. A GREAT MOVIE BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY TALKS ABOUT HOW YOU WIND UP IN A FACILITY- AND YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET OUT- IN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPEN. BUT AT THE SAME TIME LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION. I HAVE TO BE REALLY HONEST. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE TO HEAR THIS YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS THAT A THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD WHO ARE ADDICTS. N. B. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT IN THE WORLD WHO DO COMMIT CRIMES AND NOT EVERY CRIME THAT IS COMMITTED. COMES FROM A PLACE OF TRAUMA- AND I'M JUST SAYING AS ABLACK WOMAN I THINK WE HAVE TO COULD NOT USE THAT- AND LEAN ON THAT EVERY SINGLE TIME SOME PEOPLE DO MAKE REALLY BAD DECISIONS. AND NEED. HELP AND SOMETIMES THEY NEED HELP THAT THEY DON'T WANT- TO HELP THEM GET BETTER OR TO GET IN THE PLACE WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENT SET OF DECISIONS AND PUT THEMSELVES- IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO ALLOW THEM TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS- I ALSO HAVE TO SAY I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS THAT THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY LACK OF TRUST WITH THE SOURCE WITH THE SPONSOR- AND FOLKS ARE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN YOU KNOW WORKING WITH D. A.'S OFFICES BECAUSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT- YOU KNOW TO BE QUITE FRANK. THOSE OFFICES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE OPPOSING A LOT OF THE BILLS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CRIMINAL LEGAL REFORM- END. IF WE ARE GOING TO OPPOSE SOMETHING WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE YOU KNOW AND- HOW VIABLE IS IT TOO REALLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUE- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THIS IS IT'S- IT'S NOT COMPLICATED BUT IT'S HARD BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD FOR FOLKS TO SAY PEOPLE MAKE BAD DECISIONS PEOPLE DO BAD THINGS THAT PEOPLE NEED HELP AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT THE HELP. THAT THEY HAVE TO GUESTS FOR THAT THEY NEED- AND I'M SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO HAS ADDICTION IN MY FAMILY ANYWAYS HAVE FOLKS WERE INCARCERATED BECAUSE OF ADDICTION- SO DON'T NOBODY TELL ME THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. SO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND I SPOKE WITH THE AUTHOR AND HE SAID THAT YOU WERE GOING TO BE HERE AND SO MISTER CHAIR IF YOU DON'T MIND I WILL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF MY QUESTIONS ALSO TO- THE USER. SO A I WANTED TO KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE FUNDED BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY SO IT'S NOT ABOUT CONSTRUCTING A NEW FACILITY BUT THERE IS CURRENTLY A JUVENILE FACILITY THAT IS NOT BEING USED AND SO THE GOAL IS TO FIGURE OUT MAYBE NOT THE GOAL BUT HOW ELSE COULD YOU USE THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY SO EIGHT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT NEW CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REFERENCED BY. THE OPPOSITION. IT'S NOT NEW CONSTRUCTION CENTER AND- THAT JUVENILE FACILITY HAS BEEN TAKEN OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE IT WAS CONTROVERSIAL WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO HAVE A SOFTER SETTING. WITH THE OPPOSITION UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THAT- WE TOOK THAT OFF THE TABLE SO WHAT WE ENVISION IS. AS I SAID. HOUSE SO LIKE WE HAVE A PLACE CALLED WALTER'S HOUSE WALTER'S HOUSE HAS ABOUT THIRTY BEDS IN IT- AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT DIRECTOR OF ALTERS HOW SPOKE IN SUPPORT. IN THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS BILL AND WALTER'S HOUSE MAYBE MOVING ACROSS TOWN CLOSER ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THAT BUILDING MAY BE OPEN- AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF THE- BUILDING. OR FACILITY THAT I A OR THAT WE ENVISION WE WOULD BE USING- IT WOULD BE SECURE IT WOULD BE LOCKED. BUT IT WOULD BE A SOFT FACILITY LIKE A LARGE HOUSE. OR APARTMENT BUILDING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT- DO AS AS- MISTER ISAAC SAID. NO BARS NO GUNS NO GUARDS IT'S NOTHING LIKE THAT IT'S A MUST MUCH SOFTER FACILITY. AND WE'RE REALLY NOT TALKING ABOUT BUILDING. MORE CELLS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO GO. SO OKAY THAT WAS MY SECOND QUESTION. MMHM THIS IS A LEVINE DOESN'T HAVE CELLS. CORRECT RIGHT OKAY- BECAUSE I HAVE. VISITED SOME PLACES IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE IT'S A MUCH SOFTER FACILITIES SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ALMOST LIKE AN APARTMENT BUILDING BUT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO COME AND GO AT NIGHT MAYBE THEY HAVE TO COME IN AND STAY- SO I GUESS I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS AN OPTION OR IF THAT. IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE THAT'S FLEXIBLE DEPENDING ON YOUR PROGRESS- IF YOU STILL HAVE TO REMAIN LOCKED UP BECAUSE I ALSO THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH FOLKS WHO ARE RECUPERATING OR RECOVERING FROM ADDICTION IS HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO DEAL IN THE REAL WORLD. IN THE REAL WORLD ISN'T NECESSARILY A LOCKED FACILITY FROM TEAM MINDS THEY DO HAVE TO SORT OF INTERACT WITH SOME OF THE YOU KNOW. FIGURING OUT HOW TO MANAGE THEIR TRIGGERS OUTSIDE- SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS- ALSO OR COULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION- HAVE IS THAT. IT'S NOT IT'S A JAIL NOT POSING AS A JAIL BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL NOT ABLE TO GO AND SOME OF YOUR CIVIL LIBERTIES ARE- TAKEN. SO AS IS THAT UNDER CONSIDERATION I GUESS BASED ON PROGRESS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO MAKE UNDERTAKEN WITHIN THIS TREATMENT FACILITY. SO THE ONLY WAY CENTER YOU COULD EQUATE THIS TO JAIL IS THE FACT THAT THE PERSON CAN'T COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE WHICH IS WHAT YOU JUST SAID AND CENTER AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. IN MOST RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES YOU HAVE A BLACKOUT PERIOD AND YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO LEAVE. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID LIKE THOSE RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES WITH BLACKOUTS IS. THE INDIVIDUAL HAVING A CHANGE OF HEART- THAT SAME EVENING OR THAT SAME DAY THE NEXT DAY AND LEAVING- SO. IT WOULD BE LOCKED COULD WE HAVE STEPPED DOWN WHERE MAYBE PEOPLE COULD COME AND GO AS THEY PLEASE JUST LIKE THEY DO AT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES AS YOU. AS YOU. SUCCEED YES WE COULD POSSIBLY CONSIDER THAT- BUT INITIALLY- WE ENVISION THAT IT WOULD BE A PLACE WHERE. THE PEOPLE INSIDE COULD NOT COME AND GO. AS A PLEASE. SO WHAT ELSE WOULD BE HAPPENING IN THIS FACILITY. IT'S JUST LIKE ANY OTHER RESIDENTIAL FACILITY THEY WOULD HAVE- BUT INDIVIDUAL THERAPY SESSIONSTHEY WOULD HAVE GROUP THERAPY THEY WOULD LEARN LIFE SKILLS THEY WOULD LEARN HOW- HOW TO HOW TO SUCCEED ON THE OUTSIDE- YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING BACK TO. TO USING- THEY WOULD LEARN ABOUT THEIR TRIGGERS THEY WOULD LEARN ABOUT- SAFETY PLANS YOU KNOW ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS IT WOULD BE VERY INTENSIVE ALMOST LIKE AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM- BUT IT WOULD BE IMPATIENT AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU THE THING IS YOU DON'T IT'S VERY TIRING- TO HAVE ALL THIS THERAPY AND ALL THESE GROUPS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO. OVERDO IT WITH THEM BUT- THEY'RE PROBABLY UP THE ALSO- DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE THAT REALLY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH- THE TREATMENT SO THEY WOULD BE KEPT BUSY- THEY WOULD HAVE CERTAINLY FREE TIME BUT THEY WOULD BE DOING A LOT OF WORK ON TO GET BETTER- I WANT TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTION ABOUT THE JUDGE BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT AS I'D READ- THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL IT SAYS JUST AFTER IT SAYS THAT THE JUDGE IS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT- AFTER BEING INFORMED BY. ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF TREATMENT PROVIDERS WHICH DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THEY HAVE TO- ADHERE TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME TIGHTENING WITH REGARDS TO THAT- BECAUSE TO YOUR POINT YOU DON'T WANT ACTIVISTS JUDGES BUT I THINK- IT'S ABOUT INDIVIDUALIZED AND CUSTOMIZED. TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THE REALITY IS THAT MOST OFTEN WHEN JUDGES ARE SENTENCING. IT'S THEIR FORMULAS YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS NINE YEARS PLUS. AND SO THIS ISN'T THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT THAT SO. I WOULD JUST LIKE THERE TO BE A LITTLE MORE CLARITY WITH REGARDS TO- HOW THE DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE BECAUSE THIS DOES GIVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO JUDGES AND WE KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES AIR ON SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE CONSERVATIVE- SO I WOULD LIKE FOR THAT TO BE RE LOOKED AT AGAIN AND THEN. HOW SUCCESS IS DEFINED TREATMENT SUCCESSES ALSO REALLY VAGUE- WHATDOES SUCCESS LOOK LIKE THAT YOU NEVER RELAPSE THAT YOU DON'T RELAPSE WHILE YOU'RE THERE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU COME OUT IF YOU COME OUT AND THEN YOU RELAPSE ARE YOU PICKED UP WHAT WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS TREATMENT CENTER AND CDC ARE IN PROBATION. I WOULD SAY THAT I DON'T THINK THAT PROBATION IS NECESSARILY TRAINED NOR CDC ARE- TRAIN TO KIND OF DO THAT. MONITORING AND SUPPORT AS IT WHEN SOMEONE GETS OUT- IF YOU'RE TRYING TO MOCK YOU KNOW HELP THEM CONTINUE. THERE SUCCESSFUL POSTTREATMENT JOURNEY SO CAN YOU KIND OF THREE TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THIS TREATMENT A AND C. D. C. R. AND B. PROBATION. SO I THINK M. NONE OF US WANT CDC ARE INVOLVED IN THIS OTHER THAN THE REPORTING THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY THEY'RE MENTIONED- IN THE BILL SO- I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE NONE OF US WANT THAT WE DON'T NEED CITY SARGSYAN. CDC ARE INVOLVED. THE MONITORING AND THIS IS KIND OF AND- I'M TRYING TO USE THE RIGHT LANGUAGE THE MONITORING WOULD BE DONE BY THE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS. BUT OUR- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DIRECTOR SHE HAD A LOT OF REALLY GOOD FEEDBACK FOR US IN TERMS OF MAKING TO BUILD MORE MORE PALATABLE. AND HELPING US WITH THE LANGUAGE AND WHAT SHE TOLD US WHICH MAKES TOTAL SENSE IS THAT- PROBATION SHOULD IS THAT THE HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONER SHOULD NOT BE SUPERVISING. THEIR CLIENTS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR CLIENTS AND IF THEY START GOING TO THE JUDGE AND SAYING. YOU KNOW. JOE IS NOT FOLLOWING THE TREATMENT PLAN THEN THEY'RE GOING TO. LOSE THAT RELATIONSHIP SO THE- MONITORING WOULD BE DONE BY. THAT HEALTH PRACTITIONERS BUT THE SUPERVISION WOULD BE DONE BY PROBATION AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE AMENDED OR CHANGED AT SOME POINT. UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. DIRECTOR YOU HAD A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AS WELL SO YOU ANSWERED THE QUESTION ABOUT CCR. I'M LISTENING TO YOUR RESPONSE ABOUT PROBATION. BUT YOU KNOW THE OTHER REALITY IS THAT I OFTENTIMES PROBATION YOU KNOW THEIR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THAT COME FROM PROBATIONERS RIGHT. NOT PROVISIONS BUT FROM THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO SORT OF ON LEARNED BEHAVIOR RIGHT BASED ON HOW YOU RUN YOUR DEPARTMENT IT JUST IS. AND SO DO YOU WOULD NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THE GOAL IS NOT TO. CREATE A NEW- SYSTEM BUT THEN AN ADVERT ONLY KIND OF CREATE THESE FINALS AT LEAD BACK TO THE OLD SYSTEM THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM AND THEN PILOT THIS OUT. IN A WAY THAT'S LIKE USING DIFFERENT PARTNERS. DO YOU KNOW REGARD TRAINING. THEM TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS OR MAYBE JUST NOT EVEN USING THEM AT ALL. SO THAT YOU CAN CREATE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES B. YOU KNOW BECAUSE THE OTHER REALITY IS IF YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF THIS AND YOU OPT TO DO THE TREATMENT. CHANCES ARE YOU'RE NOT A FIRST TIMER CHANCES ARE YOU'VE ALREADY HAD SOME PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT. SO CHANCES ARE. YOU DON'T HAVE A GREAT SORT OF RELATIONSHIP OR THERE ISN'T A HIGH LEVEL OF CREDIBILITY WITH THAT DEPARTMENT- OR WITH SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE WORKING IN THERE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP. RIGHT SO- WE EXPECT RELAPSES THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WE EXPECT TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS IT'S NOT GOING TO BE AN ELEVATOR GOING TO THE TOP GOING TO BE AN ESCALATOR AND SO WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH COURT WE HAVE AN ADDICTION INTERVENTION COURT- THESE ARE FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TREATED SAFELY OUT IN THE COMMUNITY BUT IN THAT COURT WE HAVE A TEAM WE ALL WORK TOGETHER SO- HE ALSO HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD WHEN YOU SAID- ACTUALLY WAS YOU CENTER THIS DISTRUST AND THAT'S A REAL SHAME THAT WE HAVE THAT- JUST BECAUSE THE DA. HAS WRITTEN A LANGUAGE FOR A BILL IT'S A SHAME THAT PEOPLE CAN GET BEHIND IT I KNOW IN OUR COUNTY AND OUR PROGRAMS WE HAVE A LOT OF TRUST. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM WORK SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS- SOMEONE AS A TECHNICAL VIOLATION SOMEONE HAS A RELAPSE THAT'S NO REASON TO KICK HIM OUT OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY COMPLETELY DISENGAGE. AND DON'T FOLLOW ANY OF THE TREATMENT PLANS AFTER AFTER OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT. THEN MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE AND MAYBE THEY RE IN A SENSE BY THEIR ACTIONS THEY'RE OPTING NOT TO BE THERE RIGHT. SO AS I SAID. WE YOU ANYONE IN A TREATMENT FACILITY WHICH THIS IS EXPECTS RELAPSES THAT'S THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. HOUSES FUNDED- SO THE FUNDING IS NOT QITE CLEAR YET BUT- I KNOW WHAT WE WERE LOOKING TO THE- OPIOID CELLUM SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OF COURSE THERE HAVE TO BE AN APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT- THAT'S ONE OF THE OPTIONS. OKAY I APPRECIATE YOU ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS- I AM. YOU KNOW I'M PROBABLY GOING TO WAIT UNTIL IT GETS TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE MY HOPE IS THAT I CAN SEE SOME OF THE RESPONSES TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I ASKED AND ALSO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO ASK BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE I THOUGHT I- HAVE FAITH IN THE AUTHOR- AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST HAVE TO. MAKE RADICAL. CREATE RADICAL OUT ALTERNATIVES- TO GET DIFFERENT OUTCOMES- SO I APPRECIATE IT. BUT I TO IN LIKE. JUMPING INTO. A DIFFERENT- A POOL WATER AND SO WANT TO MAKE SURE NOBODY GETS BURNT OUT. WE ALL ARE THANK YOU. YEAH OF COURSE. I JUST APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR RING IN THIS MEASURE FORWARD AND- KEEPING AT A LOCAL PILOT PROGRAM I APPRECIATE THE PILOT PROGRAM SPECIALLY- IN THIS CASE- I THINK ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS IN THE PAST WITH BUT CERTAIN PRIVATE PURPOSE I HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH THE COMMITTEE- IS THE- THE PERCEIVED- CULTURE THAT COULD BE PERMEATED BY. PROMOTING CERTAIN BEHAVIORAL SO THAT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN THAT I HAVE BUT I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A LOCAL PRIVATE AT LOCAL PILOT PROGRAM. AND APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU FOLKS ARE- TRYING TO BE CREATIVE AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX. AND AN ISSUE THAT IS UP FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND JERRY HAVE. PREVALENT IN IN THE IN THE COUNTY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I DON'T WANT TO BE REDUNDANT BUT I THINK WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS THAT HAS BEEN RAISED- BY ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE AS IT RELATES TO. THIS MEASURE AND- FOR THE FACT THAT IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM IS DISTRICTS SPECIFIC- LEADS ME WILL A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORT AND MOVING AS MEASURE FOR BUT I HAVE QUESTIONS. IS THERE A DRUG COURT SYSTEM ANNUAL O'CONNOR. THERE IS A DRUG COURT SYSTEM WE DON'T CALL IT DRUG COURT WE ACTUALLY CALL IT DICTION INTERVENTION COURT AND WE HAVE ALL SORTS OF SORTS OF DIVERSIONARY PROGRAMS BUT FOR SOMEONE TO GET INTO OUR ADDICTION INTERVENTION COURT WE HAVE A TEAM WE HAVE A TREATMENT TEAM THAT ASSESSES THEM AND RECOMMENDS WHETHER THEY'RE SUITABLE FOR THE PROGRAM IN ORDER FOR THEM TO BE SUITABLE FOR THE PROGRAM. THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE TREATMENT AND SUPERVISION IN THE COMMUNITY N. FOR THIS POPULATION WHO WOULD BUT FOR HELP YELLOW BE SERVING TIME IN JAIL OR PRISON- THEY'RE NOT THE POPULATION THAT WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR BEING TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY. ALL RIGHT AND- UNDERSTANDING THAT BOTH. BEING RAISED IN A HOUSEHOLD BY A NURSE SHOES STILL WITH A DICTION AND DEALT WITH MENTAL ILLNESS- ONE CARD FEELS THIS MORE OF A COWORKERS AND THEN A VOLUNTEER SITUATION SO CAN YOU HELP EXPLAIN- THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THOSE ADVOCATE TO DO THIS WORK ON A DAILY BASIS AND YOU WOULD THINK. THEY WOULD BE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF SUCH A PROGRAM BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE GREAT CONCERN. AT ALL I'LL TAKE A CRACK AT THAT- AGAIN THIS IS A VOLUNTARY EFFORT. THAT WE DID PUT IN THE BILL THAT SOMEONE HAS ENOUGH SECOND THOUGHT HAD BACKS OUT. THE DAY BEFORE ONCE THEY ENTER THEY CAN THEY CAN REVERT TO. BUT AGAIN THEY'RE NOT REVERTING GOING BACK ON THE CLOSER THEIR UNDERLYING SENTENCE BUT ARGUE THAT MANY TIMES LIKE AS SENATOR CONGRESS SAID. MANY FAMILIES WE'VE WE'VE HAD PEOPLE YOU HAD TO HAVE INTERVENTIONS. THOSE ARE KIND OF ARTICLE WORSENS OR THE CONTROLLING SOMEONE TO MAKE A DECISION PROBABLY. THIS ISN'T YOU KNOW SAYING CHOOSE THIS OR ELSE BUT IT'S PROVIDING I THINK. AN OPTION WE'D LIKE PEOPLE TO TAKE THIS OPTION BECAUSE ONE THEY CAN GET BETTER. FOR THEMSELVES FOR THEIR FAMILY AND FOR A COMMUNITY AND AS I TALKED WITH SENATOR WIENER ABOUT EARLIER RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT WHEN IT SAYS. THEY DOING THIS THEY WOULD MOST LIKELY HAVE A LOT OF A SHORTER TERM. IN IN THE SYSTEM AS WELL SO. IT IT'S NOT- COERCE WE INCENTIVIZED HOPEFULLY PEOPLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION AND I WOULD THINK IT'S A SOUND DECISION AS WELL. AND IF AND THE FLIP SIDE WHAT'S THE ALTERNATE BEING INCARCERATED. WITH NO TREATMENT WOULD PROBABLY ACCESS TO DRUGS AND FORTUNATELY IN OUR STATE PRISON SYSTEM. IN COUNTY JAILS UNFORTUNATE HAPPENS ANYWAY. MMHM WILL THE WAS QUITE THE- I DIDN'T THAT IT WOULD SHORTEN YOUR TERM- IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE WHILE. THERE ON WHETHER YOU WOULD HAVE A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME SIR BASED ON THE SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IT SOONER PALM HARBOR- SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE CAN DEFINE THAT THAT IF A PERSON CLEARLY- COMPLETES THE PROGRAM THAT HE OR SHE- WOULD HAVE A REDUCE TIME TO BE SURE. AND IT YOU KNOW- I SEE A NEED FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE AS YOU STATED. THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO GO TO PRISON WHO. GO THERE WITH AN ADDICTION USUALLY GET OUT WITH THAT SAME ADDICTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE REAL REHABILITATION AND OUR PRISON SYSTEMS IN OUR JAIL SYSTEM SO THIS AFFORDS OPPORTUNITY FOR REHABILITATION I WOULD HOPE- AND REDUCED- YOU KNOW- THEY RETURN RECIDIVISM SO TO SPEAK- BUT YEAH THAT'S A LOT OF CONCERNS AND I GUESS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SCENARIOS WHERE WE HEAR OFTEN.

COULD YOU SHOP THROUGH ALL OF THAT AND- WE PROMISE THAT. WE'LL MAKE YOU'RE ABOUT TO STEM SHORT OF THE PRISON. ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE IN YOUR COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN AND A TO JOIN WITH THE OTHER SENATORS AND- HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR BILL THIS AFTERNOON- TURN MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SIX. THE BILL THAT SEEKS TO PROVIDE UNIVERSAL MEASURES THAT ESTABLISH TWO THINGS. WHAT IT MEANS FOR POLICE OFFICER TO INTERVENE WHEN WITNESSING AN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE BY ANOTHER PEACE OFFICER. AND TO CERTAIN OUTCOMES FOR FAILURE TO INTERVENE. MEMBERS WE WERE ALL JUST MADE BY THE TRAGIC EVENTS THAT LED TO THE UNTIMELY DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD. AND TO THEIR CREDIT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE CONDEMNED THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPERVISING OFFICER INVOLVED IN THAT INCIDENT. THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THEIR CHILDREN. THE SUPERVISING OFFICER WAS CHARGED WITH KILLING OF GEORGE FLOYD. BUT JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FORD DOESN'T REST IN HIS CONVICTION ALONE. NOW THE COUNTRY HAS TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO THE UPCOMING TRIAL OF THE THREE OTHER OFFICERS. MEMBERS I WOULD ARGUE THAT IN THE DAYS WEEKS AND MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRAGIC EVENTS. THAT THE PROTESTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WE WITNESSED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE'RE NOT SAYING REALLY FOCUS ON JUST THE ACTIONS OF THE SUPERVISING OFFICER. THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE ALSO PROTESTING THE FACT THAT THE THREE ADDITIONAL OFFICERS SIMPLY STOOD BY AND WATCHED HIM DIE. THAT IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. MEMBERS CURRENT LAW AS WRITTEN SIMPLY REQUIRES AN OFFICER HAS A DUTY TO INTERVENE. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM IS NOT HOWEVER THE PROBLEM IS THAT NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW ESTABLISHES FOR EXPLAINS WHEN IN FACT A PEACE OFFICER HAS INTERVENE. ABSENT THIS UNDERSTANDING AT LEAST THE PUBLIC UNINFORMED AND LAW ENFORCEMENT THE ABILITY TO DEFINE INTERVENTION HAS NGUYEN WHATEVER EACH INDIVIDUAL PIECE OFFICER DEEMS APPROPRIATE. FOR THESE REASONS I PUT FORTH AB TWENTY SIX. B. TWENTY SIX CLARIFIES AND ESTABLISHES INTERVENTION OR INTERCEDE TO INCLUDE BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE USE OF A DE ESCALATION TECHNIQUES CONFRONTING THE OFFICER APPLYING EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE. PHYSICALLY STOPPING THE EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE WHEN IN A POSITION TO DO SO. ACCORDING IN DOCUMENTING THE INCIDENT AND REAL TIME WITH BODY CAMERAS AND REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO DISPATCH OR TO THE WATCH COMMANDER IN REAL TIME STATING THE OFFENDING OFFICER'S NAME. UNIT LOCATION TIME AND SITUATION. ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT AN ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE HAS BEEN MADE. ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES A PEACE OFFICER SUPPORT TO SUPPORT I'M SORRY TO REPORT THE INCIDENT IMMEDIATELY TO HIS OR HER SUPERVISOR. AB TWENTY SIX PROHIBITS RETALIATION ON PEACE OFFICERS FOR REPORTING THE INCIDENT. THE PROHIBITS AN OFFICER FROM TRAINING OTHER OFFICERS FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE THAT AN EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE COMPLAINT. WAS SUBSTANTIATED. ALL DUE PROCESS RIGHTS IN KHOBAR ARE PRESERVED IN THIS BILL. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE PUT FORWARD IN THIS BILL FOR ESTABLISHING THAT AN OFFICER HAS INTERVENE CAN ACTUALLY BE APPLIED IN REAL WORLD SCENARIOS. MY OFFICE REACHED OUT TO THE POST. BOB WHO IS CHARGED TO DEVELOP DUTY TO INTERVENE TRAININGS. IN OUR CONSULTATION WITH THE LEGISLATIVE LIAISON FOR POST WE HAVE CONFIRMED THAT THE DUTY TO INTERVENE TRAINING IN ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS ASSOCIATED WITH FAILURE TO INTERVENE ISN'T ALL OF THE USE OF FORCE TRAININGS. IT IS IN THE ACADEMY AS WELL AS IN SERVICE TRAINING AND RECENTLY THE COMMISSION MANDATED USE OF FORCE TRAINING AS A PERISHABLE SKILL. WHICH MAKES THE REQUIRED TRAINING FOR EVERY IN SERVICE OFFICER EVERY TWO YEARS. IN FACT POSTERS PURCHASE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR A HUNDRED VIRTUAL REALITY SIMULATORS THAT WILL BE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY OFFER SIMULATOR USE OF FORCE DE ESCALATION COURSE THAT LITERALLY PRACTICES INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES AND SCENARIOS. MEMBERS THIS IS A BILL THAT ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND REESTABLISHES PUBLIC TRUST BY EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ON THE LAWFUL PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES OF PEACE OFFICERS WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY HAVE IN FACT ATTEMPTED TO INTERVENE TO STOP EXCESSIVE. USE OF FORCE. AB TWENTY SIX SIMPLY CODIFIES WHAT IS LITERALLY BEING TAUGHT AS WE SPEAK. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS MY OFFICE HAS MET WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING PORAC IN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE GONE NEUTRAL. HOWEVER SOME CONCERNS REMAIN. AFTER DIGITAL DISCUSSION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT I HAVE TAKEN THE NECESSARY STEPS TO SEND THEIR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL FOR DRAFTING WITH THE COMMITMENT TO SUBMIT THOSE AMENDMENTS TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS SHOULD THIS BILL GET OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY STATE AND SECTION ONE- SECTION AND SECTION ONE SECTION SEVEN TWO EIGHT SIX OF THE GOVERNMENT CODEIS AMENDED LINE TO READ THE REQUIREMENT THAT AN OFFICER THAT HAS RECEIVED ALL REQUIRED TRAINING ON THE REQUIREMENT TO INTERCEDE AND FAILS TO ACT PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH NINE BE DISCIPLINED UP TO AND INCLUDING THE SAME MANNER AS THE OFFICER THAT COMMITTED. THE EXCESSIVE FORCE. IN THAT SPIRIT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I SEE YOU HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS YOU HAVE A BRIAN **** IS THAT WOULD NOT READY AT THIS POINT MR OPERATOR. WE HAVE FRANK **** ON THE LINE WE WILL FOR HIM THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY HE MADE CAN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN FOR PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I AM DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER BRIAN **** WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTRY POLICE HAVE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE WITH LITTLE FEAR OF CONSEQUENCES FOR FAR TOO LONG. A RECENT STUDY FOUND THAT ABOUT ONE IN EVERY ONE THOUSAND BLACK MEN WILL BE KILLED BY POLICE. POLICE VIOLENCE IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG MEN OF COLOR. SAN FRANCISCO BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITY HAS LARGELY BORNE THE BRUNT OF THE VIOLENCE SO MUCH SO THAT SEPARATE US COACH ENTERED INTO A REFORM AGREEMENT THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. IT'S BEEN ONE YEAR SINCE GEORGE WARD WAS MURDERED BY POLICE. WE KNOW THE POLICE VIOLENCE THE NOT BE DEADLY TO BE A LEADER. OR MORALLY REPULSIVE. IN ROCHESTER NEW YORK LEAST PEPPER SPRAYED A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL. SHE SAT IN A POLICE CAR HANCOCK COVERED IN SNOW. BUT WE CAN REPORT IT REVEALED IT HAS BECOME A TOO OFTEN REFRAIN. WHEN A PERSON TO FRICKLEY A PERSON OF COLOR DOES NOT COMPLY QUICKLY NOUGH OCCIDENTALIS OR TO A NECESSARY FORCE. THE INCIDENTS IN ROCHESTER AND MINNEAPOLIS ALSO REAL TO THE STARTLING TRUTH AB TWENTY SIX ADDRESSES. OFFICERS SIMPLY STOOD BY AND DID NOTHING. CLEVELAND VOLUNTARILY LIMIT THEIR USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE OR CALL IT OUT WHEN IT HAPPENS. LLAMAS PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDELINES ON HOW OFFICERS INTERCEDE WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE I DO NOT. AB TWENTY SIX PROVIDES A CLEAR FRAMEWORK TO TAKE CONCRETE PORTABLE STEPS TO INTERCEDE AND PROTECT OFFICERS MATTEL USUALLY WHEN THEY DO INTERCEDE. TO MORE TO ENSURE THAT OFFICERS WHO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE OR FAILED INITIATOR HELD ACCOUNTABLE. I CAN'T BE CONTROVERSIAL. THE LINE'S BEEN IRREPARABLY HARMED OR INJURED BECAUSE OF PREVENTABLE UNNECESSARY POLICE VIOLENCE WHICH ARE SWORN TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THEY ALSO MUST PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM UNNECESSARY POLICE VIOLENCE AB TWENTY SIX BRING CALIFORNIA CLOSER TO MAKING THAT A REALITY FOR THIS REASON I SUPPORT AB TWENTY SIX AN URGE TO DO SO AS WELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER **** NO WILL MOVE TO THIS ROOM THAT WE ARE WITH THIS IS IN SUPPORT OF. AB. TWENTY SIX.

BURBANK RIVERSIDE IN CULVER CITY- WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN OPPOSE POSITION ON AB TWENTY SIX HOWEVER WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR- AND IT KNOWLEDGE IS- MA'AM WE APPRECIATE HIM- AND THIS WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US IN ENSURING THE BILL APPROPRIATELY DISCIPLINES OFFICERS. WHO'VE. SINCE IT REFUSE TO CONFORM THEIR ACTIONS TO THEIR WITH THEIR TRAINING AS MENTIONED BY THE SOMEONE IS A BEAST TWENTY SIX ADVANCES FROM THIS COMMUNITY CENTER PREPARATIONS WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIX UPON ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT. AGAIN WE THINK THE OTHER FOR HIS WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL LOOK FOR CHANGING OUR POSITION TO NEUTRAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION AS SHOWN ON BOTH. GOOD AFTERNOON MR DURING COMMITTEE SHAUN RUNDLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OR CPO A IN OPPOSITION BUT THE MAN DID TO AB TWENTY SIX. WE AS WELL DEEMED THE CURRENT MEASURE IMPROVEMENT WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR SUCH DILIGENCE BUT- SOME OF OUR OUR LINGERING CERN'S BUT LINGERING CONCERNS TO REMAIN OVER THE CURRENT DRAFTING. BUT AS A NON UNION LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION OF MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND COPS TO KILL A- IS A GROUP OF COPS WHO WANT TO BE IN THE BEST COPS AND ARE MEMBERS OF ALL RANKS NEEDS TO THE CROSS CALIFORNIA FEEL THAT THE- MEASURES PROVISIONS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE. OR SOME OF THEM WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE BEST B. TWO THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO. BECAUSE OF THE WORK ON THAT BILL AND OTHER USE OF FORCE REFORMS FROM. PREVIOUS YEARS DUTY TO INTERCEDE IT'S NOT A NEW IDEA AND ONE THAT WE HAVE LONG SUPPORTED WHAT. SB SIX TWENTY SIX DOES HOWEVER. IS MANDATE AGENCY POLICIES TO INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT AN OFFICER INTERVIEWED WHEN PRESENT IN OBSERVING IN OTHER OFFICERS. FORCE THAT IS CLEARLY BEYOND WHICH IS NECESSARY. SO WE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE ASSESSMENT THAT THE BILL IS CURRENTLY A CLEAR FRAMEWORK WITHOUT A DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES CLEARLY BEYOND. THAT WE'VE SUCH ACTIONS OPEN TO WIDE OF INTERPRETATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY LITIGATION. AT THE END BIGGEST DEFINITION OF CLEARLY BEYOND NOW ALSO MAKES THE DISCIPLINARY PROVISIONS. BETTER STILL IN PLACE MORE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL SO THAT RELATES TO A DUTY TO INTERCEDE OR REPORT. SECTION B. THREE INCLUSION OF IMMEDIATELY REPORT POTENTIAL EXCESS SUPPORT TO A SUPERIOR OFFICER.IS ALSO PROBLEMATIC NOT ONLY FOR ITS VAGUENESS BUT ALSO THAT THEY'RE SUPER THAT THEIR SUPERIOR OFFICER MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE BOND. BROWN TO. PERHAPS FOR. ADDITIONALLY ARE MEMBERS OF FELT THAT SUCH LANGUAGE NOTING DUTY TO ACT OR FAILURE TO DUTY. COULD BE INCLUDED TO HELP CLARIFY EXACTLY HOW THEIR ACTIONS ARE OUR BEST HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SUCH A CLEARCASE WERE ALSO ALIGNED WITH SECTION NINETEEN OF THE BILL IS THE AUTHOR MEMBER- MENTION WHEREBY DUTY TO ACT OR FAILURE TO DUTY LANGUAGE WOULD COME INTO PLAY WHEN YOU'RE HOLDING OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. WHO DIDN'T INTERCEDE WHEN MAY QUOTE FAILED TO ACT THAT THE SECTION STATE. THE BILL READ NOW THOSE OFFICERS WHO DIDN'T INTERVENE WOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME DISCIPLINE SANTEE DISCOVERY WHO COMMITTED EXCEPT SUPPORTS WHICH WE DON'T GOES PRUDENT POLICY WENT. WHEN ACTS CLEARLY BEYOND EXCEPT THEY WERE NOT DEFINED. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAD A PROBATIONARY OFFICER WHO WHO DIDN'T INTERVENE VERSUS THE TWENTY. FIVE YEAR BET WITH A CLEAR RECORD WHO ALSO DIDN'T INTERCEDE THEN YOU DEAL WITH THOSE IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY AND BE ASKED TO. YOU KNOW WANT TO BE ABSOLUTE SENSE WE TREAT THEM TO SAY. THE SAME WAY IS NOT A SOLUTION WE CAN FULLY GET BEHIND- AND AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OFFICER ACCOUNTABILITY AND MORE. IMPORTANTLY REMOVAL AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN EXCESSIVE FORCE IT IS CLEAR. THE SHARED GOAL AMONG US ALL AND GO AGAIN THE BILL HAS IMPROVED AND WE HOPE TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION AS WELL WHEN. CERTAIN DEFINITIONS CAN BE ADDED TO ADDRESS TO THE DISCIPLINE MANDATES ARE WORKABLE. BUT GIVEN THE CURRENT DRAFTING HOWEVER WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO AB TWENTY SIX AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MR THANK YOU. MODERATOR I WILL GO BACK TO THE ROOM AND WITNESSES IN OUR- OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY NINE WILL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL.

INTERCEDED AT ANY MOMENT THERE MR FOR IT WOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY BUT TO THEIR- UNWILLINGNESS TO. SEE THE HUMANITY AND MISTER FLOYD OUR- INTERCEDE IN WAR.

NO CALM LAGER SKINNER HI IN OUR AYE WIENER. LOU THE ROLE OPEN FOR THOSE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU MR HOLDEN NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO WHO WE AYE MR GABER HE'S UP NEXT WITH. AB. FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR. APRIL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN ON AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR A COMMONSENSE EFFORT TO BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY TO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TO ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER RESOURCES ARE SPENT IN A MANNER THAT TRULY ADVANCES JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE WELL AWARE IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF NOTABLE REFORMS TOWARD JUSTICE SYSTEM THESE REFORMS HAVE AIMED TO REDUCE AMASSING MASS INCARCERATION FOR MORE PROMOTE PATHWAYS TO REHABILITATION AND MORE EFFECTIVELY ADVANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. RIGHT THE SUCCESS OF THESE REFORM CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO LEAD THE NATION IN SPENDING ON CORRECTIONS. INDEED OVER THE PAST DECADE CDC ARE SPENDING HAS INCREASED BY OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS OR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT. AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPENDS MORE ON CORRECTIONS AND THEN TEXAS THE NEW YORK COMBINED. EXTENSIVE SPENDING ON CORRECTIONS HAS RESULTED IN DIMINISH REVENUES FOR OTHER PUBLIC POLICY PRIORITIES INCLUDING EDUCATION HOUSING TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR BUILT ON BIPARTISAN MOMENTUM TO PROMOTE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY AND CALIFORNIA'S FAILED EXPERIMENT WITH MASS INCARCERATION. MODELED AFTER SUCCESSFUL PROTOCOLS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN PHILADELPHIA NORTHERN VIRGINIA AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL BRING ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY TO THE SENTENCING PROCESS AND INCENTIVIZE PROSECUTORS AND JUDGES TO CONSIDER THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE MEANS. TO ADVANCE JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT IMPOSE ANY REAL BURDEN ON PROSECUTORS RATHER IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO TAKE THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF INCARCERATION OR SUPERVISION. WHICH WILL BE CALCULATED REPORTED BY THE ALEJO OR THE DSCC AND MULTIPLY THAT BY THE LENGTH OF SIDE OF THE SENTENCE THEY'RE RECOMMENDING. JUDGES WILL THEN HAVE THE OPTION THEIR COMPLETE DISCRETION TO CONSIDER THIS INFORMATION IF AT ALL IN THE MANNER THAT THEY BELIEVE IS MOST APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL THIS BILL DOES NOT DIMINISH OTHER APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE CRIMES BUT MERELY ADDS ONE OTHER ADDITIONAL DATA POINT FOR THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER. IF THEY SO DESIRE. IT SO DOES IT DOING AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR WILL PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY IN THE SENTENCING PROCESS AND INCENTIVIZE PROSECUTORS TO ENSURE THAT TAXPAYER RESOURCES ARE SPENT WISELY AND IN A MANNER THAT TRULY ADVANCES JUSTICE AND PUBLIC SAFETY. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL IS LARISSA SEPARATISTS ON BEHALF OF RESTORE JUSTICE THANK YOU AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL MISSED SAYS WITH THIS WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS.

GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS JIM WEINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. BLIND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STAND TO LOSE OUT ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. AN ONLINE. ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR. BLIND ONE HUNDRED NINETY FOUR. MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE SEE WE HAVE ONE LEAD- WITNESS IN OPPOSITION LEARN MORE CITIES PREPARED YOU CAN BEGIN HIS TESTIMONY NO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LAURIE MORE SOMEBODY HAVE THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR THE SPECIAL REQUIRES PROSECUTORS THE STATE ON THE RECORD AT SENTENCING THE ESTIMATED COST OF INCARCERATION OR SUPERVISION. OR ANY PROPOSED SENSE OF A PRE SENTENCE REPORT AS ORDERED THE PROBATION DEPARTMENT MUST PREPARE AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH INCARCERATION- SUPERVISED RELEASE. FOR A PROPOSED SENTENCE WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHAT THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS THE COST OF INCARCERATION AND CDCR IS RELEASED ANNUALLY SO THAT FIGURE WILL BE REPEATED EACH TIME A PERSON IS SENTENCED TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. IF THE IDEA IS TO MAKE JUDGES AWARE OF THE COST OF STATE PRISON WE EXPECT THEY'LL GET IT THE FIRST TIME IT STATED ON THE RECORD AND WON'T NEED IT REPEATED EACH AND EVERY TIME A PERSON IS SENTENCED. AS THAT NUMBER WILL NOT CHANGE. HOWEVER GIVEN THE PLETHORA OF EARLY RELEASE PROGRAMS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN RECENT YEARS IT WILL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A PROSECUTOR TO STATE WITH ANY REAL ACCURACY JUST HOW LONG ANY INMATE LASER. ARE PROSECUTORS EXPECTED OFFER A FIGURE BASED ON THE FULL SENTENCE OR JUSTICE FOR KNOWN CREDIT LET ALONE UNKNOWN CREDIT IN POINT OF FACT THERE WILL BE NO REAL WAY FOR ANYONE TO DETERMINE HOW MANY CREDITS AN INMATE MAY OR. MAY NOT TURN OVER YOUR LOCAL. THE CARD SELECTION. OUT CAN UP. STATE WITH ANY ERA. OR CERTAIN WHAT THE COST OF NEC. SENTENCE WILL BE. IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT ACCURACY AND CERTAINTY WHAT IS THE POINT OF THE BILL. EVEN THE MOST RECENT FIGURES ON CDC ARE COSTS MUST BE VIEWED WITH CAUTION. WELL THE NUMBER OF INMATES INCARCERATED IN CALIFORNIA HAS DROPPED BY MORE THAN TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. THE COST OF INCARCERATION IS ACTUALLY REALLY. SUBSTANTIAL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR IT COSTS AND ESTIMATED AB ONE THOUSAND TO HOUSING INMATES IN CDC ARE. ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S MOST RECENT BUDGET THAT FIGURES EXPECTED DECLINE BY MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THOUSAND BY THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR. IT COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT TRUE THAT DESPITE A REDUCED INMATE POPULATION THE COST OF RUNNING CDC OURS ACTUALLY INCREASED CONSIDERABLY. SO IT'S HARD ARGUES THIS BILL DOES THAT SHORTER SENTENCES ALTERNATIVE SENTENCES RESULT IN COST SAVINGS TO CALIFORNIA. THE ESTIMATES FOR LOCAL TIME OR EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN THE COST OF INCARCERATION VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND THE ACTUAL TIME IN CUSTODY ANYONE SERVICE. CAN VERY DRAMATICALLY BASED ON A HOST OF CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS JAIL CROWDING DIVERSION PROGRAMS ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE CREDIT THE BETTER. A PERSON SENTENCED TO A YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL MAY DO LESS THAN HALF THAT. WHAT COST YOU THE PROSECUTOR PUT ON THE RECORD. IT WOULD BE DECEPTIVE TO PUT THE COST ABOUT FOUR YEARS INCARCERATION ON THE RECORD WHEN AT CERTAIN HERE SHE WON'T DO THAT MUCH THOUGHT. THE BILL ALSO FAILED TO ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY THE COST OF CRIMINALITY OR RECIDIVISM. THE DEPENDED IS WHAT LEAST BECAUSE OF HE COST OF INCARCERATION GOES ON TO COMMIT MORE CRIMES BECAUSE HERE SHE IS NOT REHABILITATED OR SIMPLY INCAPABLE OF ABIDING IN SOCIETY. HOW DO WE ESTIMATE THOSE COSTS. OR THE COST OF THE SYSTEM PROSECUTION DEFENSE JUDICIARY PROBATION ALL ACTION. WHEN INDIVIDUALS RE. OFFENSE WE KNOW ALL TOO WELL ALL THAT IS THAT IT IS EXPENSIVE OWN CARS. AND IS PRISON ACCOUNT JAIL BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS THE BY CRIME ON. AND ALL NEVER BE AT. OR ACT CALLED QUAN. YOUR GOING BILL. EFFECTS OF CRIME UNDER COMMUNITIES BE GIVEN AROUND NUMBER. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL THOUGH WELL INTENTIONED INACCURATELY ELEVATES DOLLARS AND CENTS ABOVE OTHER EQUALLY COMPELLING CONSIDERATION. THAT MUST GO INTO ASSESSING SENTENCING DECISIONS. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU NOW WILL GO TO THE ROOM- HERE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE IS ANYONE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM- DISCHARGE OF PLAN- SPEAKING- AND OPPOSITION OF. THIS MEASURE FOURTEEN FOR SEVENTY FOUR SHE NINE WILL GO TO TWENTY FORTY. C. NINE. MODERATOR ARE THERE WITNESSES DESIRING TO SPEAK AND OPPOSITION OF FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR ON THE LINE IF SO NOW'S THE TIME TO QUEUE. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. FOURTEEN SEVEN OR PLEASE PRESS ONE BUTTON ZERO THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE TEN ZERO. AND ALIGNED TO HUNDREDS OF I APOLOGIZE WE LOST LINE TWO HUNDRED SIX IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AGAIN. AND OUTLINED TWO HUNDRED SIX OR MY COULD OPEN. SHARON RILEY ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL- BUT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL HOWEVER WE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH DOCTOR AND HIS STAFF LAST WEEK AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING OUT AND THEN MEANT THAT WE HOPE WILL ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO NOT TO THIS. AND IT WE HAVE ONE MORE COMMENT COMING THROUGH ONE MOMENT PLEASE WHILE WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THEIR LINE NUMBER. ONE MORE MOMENT PLEASE SEND NOW WILL GO TO THE LINE OF TWO HUNDRED FIVE YOUR MIKE IT'S OPEN. IT'S BEEN DELIVERED TO THE LENDER OF RECORD AT THE BACKSEAT IN PORT- OF OUR ORGANIZATION RESTORED TO THE SUPPORT BILL AS WELL AS A YOUNG WOMEN CHOOSING ACTION ON COMMON LAW AND. FELONY MURDER ELIMINATION PROJECT. AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. OUR LADY NOW WILL COME BACK TO THE HEARING ROOM- WITNESSES AND- OPPOSITION NO ANSWER WHERE DID ONCE IN OPPOSITION TO WERE. RIGHT AND SMART WE'RE GOOD I'M A BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS I COMMITTEE ON THIS MEASURE. CENTER CALLER I THINK I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I'M ACTUALLY VERY INTERESTED IN THE BILL I MAINTAIN THAT- THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM ISN'T ECONOMIC ENTERPRISE- AND- YOU MAKE MONEY WHEN FOLKS COME INTO COURT. AND WHEN FOLKS GET SENTENCE AND- WHEN THEY VIOLATE AND WHEN THEY COME BACK IN SO IT WOULD BE REALLY GREAT FOR FOLKS TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE. SO THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO HOW TO HAVE A MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM- THAT IS REALLY NOT RATING THE WALLETS OF OUR TAXPAYERS. AND DELIVERING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT OF HIGH VALUE. YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO SHARE MISTER CHAIR THAT HAN APPROPRIATIONS ON WHICH YOU AND I SAID THERE WAS- AN URGENCY BILL THAT CAME TO US NOT LONG AGO THAT. WAS TALKING ABOUT PAYING BACK FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND INCARCERATED AND THE COST WAS A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS A DAY AND I SUBMIT THAT IT COSTS MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS A DAY. TO INCARCERATE THEM SO THEY GOT THE SHORT END OF THE STICK. SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HELP REALLY- UP LIFT THOSE. ERRORS IN CALCULATIONS- AND MAYBE HAVE FOLKS ALLOW FOLKS TO HAVE A GREATER APPRECIATION FOR WHAT THIS WHOLE SYSTEM IS- BY. ALLOWING THERE TO BE SOME GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO RUN- SO THAT PEOPLE SEE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR- I WILL BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. Q. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR. I THINK THIS IS A PROPER TIME TO MOVE THE BILL. IT HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CALM WATER. THE SERMON GABRIEL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS CENTER MAKE US BUT JUST JUST TO ADD A FEW THINGS HERE- YOU KNOW THAT WERE WERE RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION- WE'RE NOT ASKING JUDGES OR PROSECUTORS TO PUT TOGETHER COMPLICATED ECONOMETRIC MODEL AND TRY TO CALCULATE WITH EXACT CERTAINTY THE COST OF. OF INCARCERATION WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO A VERY SIMPLE- VERY SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION RIGHT WHICH IS TO SAY I'M PROPOSING A SENTENCE OF EIGHT YEARS EIGHT TIMES EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THIS AMOUNT I'M PROPOSING A SENTENCE OF TEN YEARS EIGHT TIMES TEN TIMES EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN HERE THIS THIS IS MEANT TO HELP THEM THINK A LITTLE BIT RIGHT IF I'M GOING TO TRY TO DECIDE IF I WANT TO RECOMMEND EIGHT YEARS OR. TEN YEARS WHAT IT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE BENEFIT TO JUSTICE IS THE BESTTO PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE ADDITION- HUNDREDS TO TWO DOLLARS THAT WILL THAT TOLD THIS PURSE FOR TWO YEARS AND JUST TO STIMULATE SOME THINKING ON THE PART OF THE- OBVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE DESCRIBED TO RECOMMEND WHATEVER SEND THEY WANT. AND THEN THE SAME THING FROM THE AND I AM I STE I SUGGEST THEIR POWER A LOT OF SITUATION IN WHICH A JUDGE WOULD SAY IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO TAKE COST INTO CONSIDERATION AT THIS POINT BUT THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE A JUDGE IN THEIR DISCUSSION WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT THIS DO WE REALLY WANT TO. LOCK THIS PERSON UP FOR A LENGTHY SENTENCE FOR POSSESSION OF A CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE IS NOT REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT TAXPAYERS IS A REALLY GOING TO BENEFIT PUBLIC SAFETY IS THAT REALLY GOING TO BAT BUT BENEFIT JUSTICE. OR IS THERE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR THAT COULD BE BETTER SPENT ON OTHER THINGS FOR THE BENEFIT OF SOCIETY FOR THE BENEFIT OF PUBLIC SAFETY SORT IS A VERY LIGHT TOUCH APPROACH- IT'S AN APPROACH THAT HAS A LOT OF THE PROMINENT CONSERVATIVE LEGAL SCHOLARS LIKE JUDGE RICHARD POSNER FROM THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT HAVE RAISED AS AN ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD TAKE AND IT'S GOING TO GET CONSIDERATION. YOUR FORMER REPUBLICAN ASSEMBLYMEMBERS INCLUDING THE FORMER REPUBLICAN LEADER WHO HAVE SAID THAT THE COST OF MASS INCARCERATION A COMPLETE WASTE OF TAXPAYER RESOURCES SO YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS IS A WAY TO BRING THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION IN A VERY. DEL K. Y. NOT ALL TO DIMINISH OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ALL OF THE THINGS THAT. THE OPPOSITION RATES ARE APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATIONS AND THEY'RE ALREADY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN THE SENTENCING PROCESS. BUT THIS IS JUST ADDS ONE ADDITIONAL DATA POINT. THAT JUDGES CAN CONSIDER. AT THEIR DISCRETION WE LEAVE IT UP TO THEM AND SO I ALWAYS THINK THAT MORE INFORMATION. IS BETTER IT WILL HLP US TO ROUTE. TO REACH OUTCOMES THAT ARE BETTER ADVANCINGJUSTICE BETTER ADVANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND WITHOUT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR COM LONGER COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR REMEMBER MICHAEL YES SOME SORT ORDER THOSE STEP OUT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR ON THIS. BILL- BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE YOU THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU. AB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FOUR BRADFORD ON REDFORD I'D SHOW. NO TROUBLED NO COM LOGGER. KAMLAGER AYE SKINNER SKINNER AYE WINNER WINNER I FOR ONE. MAJOR HAS FOUR YES VOTES ONE NO IT'S OUT CONGRATULATIONS NOW MOVING ON TO SOME WOMEN STONE. HE HAS AB. FIVE OH THREE. WE'RE PROPERLY CLEANED UP THERE YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR PREFERRED PRISON TATIAN RISTORANTE. THANK YOU. B. FIVE OH THREE IS INTENDED TO. PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY COUNTY BY COUNTY WITH. OUR YOUTH WHO ARE ON NONCUSTODIAL WAR CHIPS IN ON PROBATION AND THAT THE FACTS ARE THAT DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY IN SOME COUNTIES IN THE FOR THE SAME ISSUES. THE PROBATION TIME CAN BE AVERAGING TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND IN OTHER COUNTIES FOR THE SAME ISSUES AVERAGING SIX MONTHS SO THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT DISPARITY BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE ALMOST 90% OF THE KIDS ON THESE WERE TO. CHRISTO DEAL PROGRAMS ARE NOT CUSTODIAL WARSHIPS ALMOST 90% FOR KIDS OF COLOR AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS THAT THESE KIDS ARE HAVING TO MEET AND THESE ARE JUST KIDS WHILE THEY'RE ON THESE **** TO WORSHIP PROGRAM SOMETIMES THEY'RE FIVE CONDITION SOMETIMES FIFTY CONDITIONS AND IF THEY'RE TOO MANY CONDITIONS. FOR A TEENAGER TO REMEMBER TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE EXTENDING TIME A PROBATION OR EVEN POTENTIALLY INCARCERATION. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH SB FIVE OH THREE IS TO SET SOME CLEAR STANDARDS THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE. NO LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS ON PROBATION. AND BUT THAT IS NOT A THAT IS NOT THE LENGTH OF TIME THEY'RE GOING TO NECESSARILY SPEND ON PROBATION. BUT AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS IT WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEW. AND BASED ON THE PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. THAT CAN BE EXTENDED IF IT IS NECESSARY TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE CHILD AND TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF JUSTICE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOME. SOME CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SERVICE THAT THAT CHILD THE NONCUSTODIAL WARSHIP THAT THAT THAT THAT CHILD IS CONTAINED FOR AND THE ABILITY OF THEM TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY NEED TO ADDRESS A TO GET BACK INTO SOCIETY TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND TO BE TREATED IN A CONSISTENT MANNER STATE BY STATE THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IT'S REQUIRING THAT THE TERMS THEN IF THERE ARE CONDITIONS OF PROBATION THOSE TERMS ARE REASONABLY RELATED TO WHAT THE CHILD NEEDS IN ORDER TO BE. REHABILITATED TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THAT'S WHAT AB FIVE FIVE OH THREE IS ABOUT WE'RE WORKING WITH. STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER TO PROPOSE SOMETHING FAIRLY SIMILAR A YEAR OR SO AGO ALTHOUGH IT WAS A YEAR RATHER THAN SIX MONTHS AND WE'RE TRYING TO SIX MONTHS BECAUSE THE WHOLE LOT OF THE WORK THAT WE HAD DONE AROUND IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM DEPENDENCY DELINQUENCY THE SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS THOSE ARE SIX MONTHS AND THEY'RE DESIGNED TO SIX MONTHS FOR A REASON. THAT IF WE LET KIDS LANGUISHED IN THE SITUATIONS THAT IT'S TO THEIR DETRIMENT. GETTING THEM THE SERVICES TO HELP THE NEED GETTING THEM TO TONE WHAT PROBLEM THAT THEY GOT THEM SO INTO BUT IN A REASONABLE OF TIME AND THEN I'LL FROM UNDERNEATH PROBE IS A THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT SO WITH THE I APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THE THEIR YOUR STAFF ANALYSIS ON THIS AS WE TRY TO MOVE THIS THROUGH IN A RESPECTFUL ASK YOUR I.

ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT SUPPORT AND ARE NOT KEPT ON PROBATION FOR LONGER THAN NEEDED. I URGE YOU TO PASS. AB FIVE ONE THREE THANK YOU. Q. NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITE. AT WE TO IN LEAD OPPOSITION MIKE BELOW AND DANIEL SANCHEZ WILL GIVE THEM THREE MINUTES APIECE FOR. THEIR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM MIKE BELOW- SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION WE APPRECIATE THE THOROUGH QUALITY ANALYSIS COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE ALSO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND HIS SPONSORS ABOUT THE BILL THERE IS MUCH THAT WE AGREE ON IN THIS. ISSUE WE DO AGREE THAT ANALYSTS PROBATION IS A BAD THING AND THAT PROBATION OUT TO BE IMPOSED NO LONGER THAN NECESSARY WE ALSO AGREE THAT- PROBATION WHICH VARIES WIDELY AMONG COUNTIES. SO THAT YOU COULD CAUSE A SITUATION CALLED. JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY IS A BAD THING SO THERE'S MUCH THAT WE AGREE ON WE DO NOT AGREE THAT A PRESUMPTIVE SIX MONTH LIMIT ON PROBATION. IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME HOWEVER AND WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS- JUVENILE COURT JUDGES IN CALIFORNIA ARE VERY VERY DEDICATED TO THE REHABILITATION OF YOUTH. A WE WERE A SPONSOR OF A BILL TO INCREASE DIVERSION FOR USE FOR EXAMPLE SB THREE EIGHTY THREE. BUT WE THINK THE SIX MONTH PERIOD IS TOO SHORT. AND IT WILL HAVE UNINTENDED EFFECTS IT COULD INCREASE CUSTODIAL TIME FOR YOU WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE UNINTENDED EFFECT IT COULD CAUSE MORE MOTIONS TO TRANSFER USED TO ADULT COURT WHICH WOULD BE AN UNFORTUNATE RESULT. WE SUGGEST THAT THE ONE YEAR. THAT WAS A PROPOSAL LAST YEAR IS A MORE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND I WOULD SAY THAT THE AT THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT THE BILL SAYS THAT AND WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT TAKING THE- PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE STANDARD FOR OVERCOMING THE SIX MONTH PRESUMPTION. BUT THE PREPONDERANCE MUST SHOW THAT IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE USE. AND THAT'S CONTRADICTORY TO. EXISTING LAWS IN WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION TWO OH TWO WHICH APPLIES TO ALL JUVENILE PROCEEDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAW SPECIFIES THREE. OBJECTIVES IT IS THE JUDGE SHALL CONSIDER THE SAFETY AND PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC. PORTENTS OF REDRESSING INJURIES TO VICTIMS AND THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE MINOR IN ALL DELIBERATIONS PURSUANT TO THE CHAPTER. AND THE BILL SAYS THAT THE- I MEAN CAN BE OVERCOME BY A PREPONDERANCE ONLY RELATING TO THE BEST INTEREST OF THE YOUTH WE THINK THAT THE JUDGE SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ALL OF THOSE FACTORS IN SECTION TWO OH TWO. WE STILL BELIEVE THAT A YEAR IS THE APPROPRIATE LENGTH AND THAT THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC. HAS TO BE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION FOR THE JUDGE IN ADDITION TO THE INTERESTS OF THE U. SO WE ARE WE HOPE THAT THE BILL COULD BE APPROPRIATELY AMENDED AT THIS POINT WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON KEREN MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHEAP PROBATION OFFICERS I OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED EIGHTY FIVE OH THREE- I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IN FRAMING OUR COMMENTS TODAY TO NOTE THAT- THE PROVISIONS HE SAID SHARE THE GOAL OF CREATING PROPHECIES TO MOVIES SUCCESSFULLY OUT OF THE SYSTEM IN THE BUILDING SYSTEM WITH LIMITS AND INCENTIVES TO HELP MOVE YOU SUCCESSFULLY THROUGH THEIR PROGRAMS AND OFFER PROBATION- AND WAS STATED EARLIER- WE HAVE PROPOSED IN PREVIOUS LEGISLATIVE YEARS. SETTING UP FRAMEWORKS- RELIGION DID YOU BUT I'LL PROBATION TERMS SO WE REALLY LEANED INTO THIS DISCUSSION AND YOU WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE OVER ARCHING GOALS IN WHICH I THINK THERE'S AGREEMENT REALLY ON AGAIN WHAT WHAT IS I'M BEING SOUGHT TO BE ACHIEVED HERE WE'VE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION SINCE THE BILL WANTED TO PRINT- WITH THE OFFERING WITH THE SPONSORS NOTING OUR CONCERNS ON THE CURRENTLY PROPOSED PRESUMPTION FOR DISCHARGE AT SIX MONTHS- AND IN LIGHT OF. THE RECENT AMENDMENTS WHICH DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THAT SPECIFIC PROVISIONS WE'RE IN A POSITION NOW TO OPPOSE AND WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BY SENDING A PRESUMPTION AT SIX MONTHS EVEN WITH THE POTENTIAL TO EXTEND THAT SIX MONTHS WERE CHIP WILL NOT BE DEEMED SUITABLE FOR SOME CASES AND WILL NOT ACCOMMODATE THE LENGTH AND CERTAIN TREATMENT ARE PROGRAMS AND THEREFORE DISPOSITION SUCH AS ADULT COURT OR SECURE SETTINGS COULD BE CONSIDERED MORE IN SOME INSTANCES WHICH IS CERTAINLY. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE MORE US WE BELIEVE THAT LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND THAT YOU PROGRESS TOWARDS OUR KEYS PLAN AND COMPLETION OF PROGRAMS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GUIDE AND THE DISCHARGE FURTHER THERE'S A GRADUATING CONTINUE LET YOU AND ALL RESPONSES TO REFLECT THE NEEDS OF USED AND THE TIMELINE SET FORTH IN THIS BILL FOR WORSHIP I WOULD NOTE ARE SHORTER IN DURATION THAN SOME OF THE OTHER GRADUATING DISPOSITIONS. SUCH AS AT THE FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT WHICH HAD THE MINIMUM OF A YEAR YOU TOO HAVE BEEN MADE WARDS OF THE COURT AS WITH THE STILL HAVE BEEN DETERMINED BY THE CORTINI FOCUS SERVICES PROGRAMMING AND TREATMENT. THAT MAY EXTEND BEYOND SIX MONTHS AND WITH MORE TO BE REALLY. WITH THE CAN ON FOR SECOND- OFF INVOLVING MORE. OFFENSE AND ENOUGH. AND APPROPRIATE. FOR THE SAFETY AND THE U. N. THE CAN- BUT I DO WANT TO HIRE. WE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT TO EXPECT OF THEM IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THEM IN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THEIR TERM OF PROBATION. AND WE AGREE WITH BUILDING A FRAMEWORK WITH PARAMETERS AND SENTENCED TO. MOVE YOU THROUGH THEIR PROGRAMS AND AGAIN OFF OF PROBATION. BUT WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT MECHANISMS CREATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND THEREFORE WE'VE AFTER THEIR TO BE CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE SIX MONTHS PRESUMPTION. THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO OUR PHONE LINES ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITE ONE NO LET'S GO TO THE COMMITTEE HEARING ROOM- SHE NO ONE HERE AND OUR OVERFLOW ROOM THERE'S NO ONE IN TWENTY FORTY EITHER NOW. MODERATE WILL GO TO OUR PHONE LINES FOR. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO YOU. AB FIVE ALL THREE. FOR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE OH THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO THAT COMMAND AGAIN ONE ZERO.

HANK YOU IN THAT LINE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY. BY. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN. HI MY NAME IS ERICA AND I'M FROM DIFFICULT MISSION APPROACH COSPONSORED AND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIVE ONE THREE THANK YOU. BLIND. TWO HUNDRED TEN. GREG STUBER ON BEHALF OF THE STATE COALITION OF PROBATION ORGANIZATIONS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY PROBATION ASSOCIATION AN OPPOSITIONAL AS AMENDED THANK YOU. LINE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE. WHERE WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES GOING OPPOSITION UNLESS AMENDED. AND WE HAVE. OUTLINED IT. TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN. FINE TWO HUNDRED SIXTEEN OR MY COULD OPEN. AND MISTER CHAIR THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENT AT THIS TIME. YOU WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO AB FIVE ALL THREE THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS AT THIS POINT. CERNER CHOKE I'M JUST KINDA CURIOUS TO KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WITH WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS THEY MENTION TODAY WELL REALIZES BILLS MEN AND MEN IT SEVERAL TIMES TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS WE CHANGE THE STANDARD OF REVIEW AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT. APPROPRIATE AMENDMENTS TO SET THAT STANDARD AT WHICH TO- TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT INSTEAD OF THE WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BILL THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD BECAUSE WE DO UNDERSTAND. THE FLEXIBILITY BEING ASKED THERE. THE SIX MONTHS I THINK IS IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE A YEAR IS A LONG TIME. IT RELIES IN SOME COUNTIES AVERAGE PROBATION IS SIX MONTHS IN SOME COUNTIES AVERAGE PROBATION TWO AND A HALF YEARS. SAME KINDS OF CRIMES SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT POINT AT WHICH TO SET THAT PRESUMPTION AND IF THERE IS A SENTENCE FOR CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS LONGER THAN THAT SIX MONTHS. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY POSSIBLE IT COULD GO ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AGO ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AGO ANOTHER SIX MONTHS DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF TREATMENT THAT'S NEEDED. DEPENDING ON WHAT THE OUTOMES REALLY FAR BUT WHAT THIS IS SETTING UP IS THAT REVIEW. AT SIX MONTHS. UNDER THIS THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND AGAIN WE'RE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS AROUND WEEK TO- TO. TO LOOK AT THE PROGRESS OF THAT CHILD IS MAKING LOOK AT THE OTHER FACTORS SO IF THE TREATMENT GOES LONGER THAN SIX MONTHS THAT'S ABSOLUTELY BUILT IT. AND WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT WE'RE CREATING DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR SETTING THOSE PROBATION CONDITIONS SO THAT THEY WILL BE MORE CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE WHICH I THINK YOU HEARD FROM THE JUDGES AND PROBATION OFFICERS. OR CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AS WELL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING I THINK FAIRLY CLOSELY WITH THEM WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS. BUT WE'VE BEEN TAKING AMENDMENTS ALONG THE WAY TO TRY AND LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FACING. AND AN ADDRESS THOSE IN THE BILL BECAUSE THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT GIVING AS MUCH FLEXIBILITY AS POSSIBLE. BUT PROVIDING CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE COUNTY BY COUNTY SO THAT THERE IS A AN APPROPRIATE EXPECTATION. OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THAT CHILD IS GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES IN IF THEY'RE IN A NONCUSTODIAL WARSHIP. WITH THE STATE SO WE ARE WHO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ULTIMATELY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS. AND FOR EXAMPLE THEY THE JUDGES DON'T MIND THE SIX MONTH REVIEW. BUT THEY WANT TO CREATE THE PRESUMPTION AT ONE YEAR. BUT THEN WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR THOSE KIDS THAT ARE THAT ARE. WOULD ONLY BE OTHERWISE BE SUBJECT TO THE SIX MONTHS BECAUSE IN THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE AN AVERAGE OF SIX MONTHS FOR THE CRIME THE THEY WOULD THEN BE EXTENDED TWO YEAR THAT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR SO. WE'RE TRYING TO SORT THROUGH THAT BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TERMS OF THE BILL THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY WANT. AND THE ABILITY TO TAILOR CONDITIONS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THAT CHILD IS REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT. SORRY I ALSO SEE HERE THAT THERE'S QUITE A BIT OF- ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN AREAS IN THE BILL THAT STATED SO THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS JUST ONE PORTION OF THE BUILDING YOU HAVE OTHER ITEMS HERE THAT YOU IS THAT WITH THE INTENT TO CREATE UNIFORMITY THROUGHOUT. HEY AND- AND THE OTHER QUESTION I NOTICED HERE WAS THAT- IN CONSIDERATION OF THE SIX MONTHS- THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH AB HELPED. IT DOESN'T TAKE IN CONSIDERATION- THE TYPES OF CRIME- SO I'M READING HERE. BECAUSE THE BILL CONTAINS NO DISQUALIFYING CRIMES A MINOR PROBATION FOR MURDER SEXUAL ASSAULT VEHICLE VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER ARMED ROBBERY OR GANG SHOOTING BE TREATED THE SAME AS A MINOR ON PROBATION FOR PETTY THEFT OR VANDALISM. BUT THAT'S NOT TRUE. BECAUSE THE PRESUMPTION IS SIX MONTHS BUT THERE'S NOTHING THAT PRECLUDES THAT FROM BEING EXTENDED BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF THE CRIME THE NEEDS OF THE CHILD. THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE THERE AND FOR A LOT OF THOSE CRIMES THOSE ARE GONNA BE CUSTODIAL CRIMES WE'RE TALKING-ABOUT NONCUSTODIAL WARSHIPS HERE SO THAT THEY ARE DIVERTED THERE THERE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT THEY'RE STILL SUBJECT TO PROBATION. AND IF THE NEEDS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE LOOKING AT WEEK TWO OH TWO STANDARD BECAUSE THAT DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PUBLIC SAFETY AND SOME OTHER THINGS RATHER THAN JUST WHAT'S WHAT THAT CHILD NEEDS AT THE TIME. SO THAT REVIEW COULD BE BUILT IN IN THE EXPECTATION IS THAT. THAT THAT SIX MONTHS IN THE PRODUCTION HERE REALLY FORCES A REVIEW OF THE CASE. PROGRESS THAT THE CHILD IS MAKING. THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES AROUND WHY THEY'RE THERE ALL THAT COULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE EXTENSION AND ESPECIALLY IS WE WORK THROUGH INCORPORATING WITH TWO OH TWO SO THE- THE NOTION THAT THAT EVERY KID IS ONLY GOING TO GET SIX MONTHS WHICH IS WHAT A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION TO SAY. IS JUST NOT TRUE. WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ESTABLISHING IS. A BASS LINE. AND THEN A REVIEW SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING. NOT ONLY THE DISPARATE. TIME ON NORTON NOT THESE NONCUSTODIAL MORE TIPS OF. YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS IN SOME CASES SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR IN OTHER CASES BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE CONSISTENCY BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS THAT THAT REVIEW IS FORCING THE COURTS TO LOOK AT THE PROGRESS OF THAT CHILD. AND LOOK AT WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE. THEY CAN EXTEND. SO IT IT IT'S NOT A CAP IT'S NOT A LIMIT. BUT IT IS A REVIEW AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CREATE THAT PRESUMPTION. SO THAT IT'S NOT A REVIEW IN NAME ONLY AND JUST CHECKING A BOX. BUT THERE'S A STANDARD THAT NEEDS TO BE MET. FOR CARRYING THE WATER SO THE MORE SERIOUS THE CRIME. THE LONGER THEY'RE GOING TO BE. POTENTIALLY ON PROBATION. I BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN- YOU KNOW DO DESERVE A SPECIAL CONSIDERATION SPECIALLY WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN AND HOW- YOU KNOW HUGE RESPONSE TO- THEIR HORMONAL STATE- AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME- BUT I AM CONCERNED WITH SOME OF THE- THE OPPOSITION'S AND I AM. I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM AS FAR AS THE- THE REVALUATION- PERIOD AND TO REALLY CONSIDER- THEY SHOULD I THINK. HERE AT LEAST THE COURT SYSTEM ALREADY DOES THAT AB WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT- AT THE SENTENCING OF A SITUATION WE HEAR THE ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE JUDGES MAYBE NOT EVERYONE BUT I THINK. THE ONES THAT- YOU KNOW. THAT I'VE UNDERSTAND. DO- BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING- THE FUTURE COLLABORATION YOU HAVE WITH THE OPPOSITION I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL RIGHT NOW BUT I DO TRULY APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT YOU'RE DOING IN CREATING THIS- THE SYSTEM FOR REVIEW FOR YOU BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT- OUR KIDS NEED HELP. AND THEY NEED TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE- KIND OF AIM AT SOMETHING FOR- TO TRY TO STRIVE TO DO BETTER IN TO CHANGE THEIR LIVES AND TO HAVE SOMETHING TO MOTIVATE THEM SO IN THAT INSTANCE I TRULY DO APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF YOUR OF YOUR BILL AT THIS TIME- BUT I DO WANT TO SEE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED- HE FURTHER- ADDRESSED- BUT I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT- COME BACK ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO SEE. HOW THEY HAVE EVOLVED. WELL HOPING IT'S NOT COULD COME BACK TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE SO YOU'LL SEE IT THERE AND THEN I FULLY EXPECTED. THAT HE WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS AND THAT'S FINE. BUT TO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE DISPARITIES COUNTY BY COUNTY IS WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING THIS AND AS WE TALK TO JUDGES WHO SAY OH I WOULD NEVER DO THAT OKAY BUT YOUR NAME THE JUDGES IN YOUR NEIGHBORING COUNTY. TO AVERAGE IN SOME COUNTIES THE TIME A PROBATION SIX MONTHS. OTHER COUNTIES TWO AND A HALF YEARS. HOW DO WE JUSTIFY THAT WITHOUT DOING SOMETHING. ABOUT IT SO IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. AB JUDGES ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY THINK IS BEST BUT SOMETIMES THEY BECOME VERY PATERNALISTIC AND THAT'S WHY YOU'LL SEE FIFTY CONDITIONS CAN YOU MATCH FIFTY CONDITIONS HAD AS A TEENAGER EVEN BEGIN TO TRACK THAT. AND AS SOON AS THERE IS A VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OF PROBATION. INFORMATION GETS EXTENDED ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS GET PUT ON THEY COULD EVEN END UP INCARCERATED. BECAUSE OF THAT EVEN THOUGH THEIR MISDEMEANOR. TRUANT THAT'S A TUITION IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE SOME COUNTIES ARE DOING A GREAT JOB OTHER COUNTIES NOT SO MUCH. THAT'S THE HEART OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY DISCUSSIONS ARE CONCERNED. BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE WE HAVE A WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR SKINNER WE HAVE A TO PASS- THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- SOONER I'M ASSUMING THAT STONE WHICH ELECT CLOSE I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU Q. ARE. COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON AB FIVE OLD THREE TO PASS AB FIVE OH THREE BRADFORD BRADFORD I'D SHOW VOGUE NO JO'BURG NO COM LONGER HI I'M LONGER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER I. THE MEASURE HAS THREE. ONE NO WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU NOW MR CUNNINGHAM WHO'S WAITED SO PATIENTLY ALL THIS TIME. HE HAS AB SEVEN HUNDRED. AND IMPROVE SURE PRETTY SURE WILL BE OUT HERE IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS SO YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. OKAY GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SENATORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB SEVEN HUNDRED- CURRENTLY DEFENDANTS IN FELONY CASES IN OUR COURTS SYSTEM ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED BY LAW TO BE PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM. DURING TWO TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS TRIAL AND PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION. HOWEVER UNDER CURRENT LAW IN CERTAIN INSTANCES A TRIAL CAN PROCEED IN THE DEFENDANT'S ABSENCE. BUT A DEFENDANT MUST BE ABSENT ABSENT QUOTE AFTER THE TRIAL OR PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION HAS COMMENCED IN THEIR PRESENCE. THIS HAS CREATED A PROBLEM PARTICULARLY DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND SEE SCENARIOS WHERE DEFENDANTS ARE IN CUSTODY AND NOT PRESENT FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TRIAL PRELIMINARY EXAM. EXAMINATION FORD EVER WHATEVER REASON IT ALSO CREATES A CONFLICT AND A PROBLEM FOR THE JUDGES ADMINISTERING THE COURT BECAUSE- IN PARTICULAR WHERE DEFENDANT HAS NOT WAIVED THEIR SPEEDY TRIAL RIGHTS FOR EITHER PRELIM OR TRIAL. BUT YET THEY CANNOT BECAUSE OF SICKNESS OR OTHER VOLUNTARY REASONS STATE CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO COURT THE JUDGES IN AN UNTENABLE SITUATION EITHER HAVE TO- NOT ABIDE BY THE SPEEDY TRIAL RIGHTS THAT THE CALL THE DEFENDANTS HAVE. ORDER THEM BROUGHT FROM A CUSTODY AGAINST THEIR WILL INTO COURT WHICH OF COURSE CREATES ALL SORTS OF PROBLEMS FOR ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE INCLUDING THE DEFENDANTS- SO THIS BILL WOULD FIX THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING A PRELIM OR TRIAL TO PROCEED IN A DEFENDANT'S ABSENCE AT YOU BUT- ONLY UNDER CERTAIN NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES. THE DEFENDANT HAS TO BE IN CUSTODY ONE. THE COURT HAS TO MAKE FINDINGS ON THE RECORD INCLUDING THERE'S CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT THE DEFENDANT IS VOLUNTARILY CHOOSING. TO NOT APPEAR IN COURT TO. DEFEND IT MUST BE REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL WHO MUST BE PRESENT IN THE COURTROOM PHYSICALLY THREE. AND THE DEFENDANT MUST HAVE AND THIS IS KEY MUST HAVE VOLUNTARILY CONSENTED TO CONDUCT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDING. AFTER BEING FORM INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS BY COUNSEL AND THE COURT- I THINK THAT STRIKES A GOOD BALANCE WE TOOK AMENDMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S AND THE ACLU- THAT I BELIEVE TRULY DID STRENGTH IN THE BILL CONSIDERABLY I THINK IT IT MAY BE WORTH OF COURSE NOT BINDING TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT DID PASSED THE ASSEMBLY SEVENTY EIGHT TO ZERO ON THE FLOOR- THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CDA AND WITH ME I THINK UNLESS HE HADTO GO TO DINNER- ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LAURIE MORSE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION OR GO TO BED. SILVA FIVE HERE I'M HERE I'M HERE SENATOR AND ASSEMBLYMAN BARRYMORE'S. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION MR- CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. DEPENDENCE IS YOU KNOW HAVE BOTH THE CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO BE PRESENT IN COURT DURING CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. COURTS HAVE LONG HELD DEFENDANTS MAY VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE PRESENT IN COURT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE PRESENT IN COURT AT THE TIME OF THE WAY. HOWEVER UNDER THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE GOVERNING A DEFENDANT'S PRESENCE. FOR A DEFENDANT TO VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR STATUTORY RIGHT TO BE PRESENT IN COURT FOR TRIAL AND PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION. THE DEFENDANT MUST BE PRESENT IN COURT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE TRIAL OF PRELIMINARY HEARING. WILL BETTER OR WORSE EVERY YEAR THERE ARE NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS WHO DO NOT WISH TO BE BROUGHT INTO COURT. EVEN FOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF TRIAL OF FREEDOM. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE COURTS ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE. IF THEY WANT TO PROCEED BECAUSE THERE ARE WITNESSES WHO MAY NOT BE LATER AVAILABLE. AND FURTHER BENT THE DELAYING THE CASE BENEFITS NO ONE THE COURT MUST BE EITHER ONE OR THE DEFENDANT FORCIBLY BE BROUGHT TO COURT ENDANGERING. THE DEFENDANT THE BAILIFFS AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE PRESENCE OR TO VIOLATE THE STATUTE. SIMILAR PROBLEM ARISES WHEN A PERSON CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR IS IN CUSTODY AND DOES NOT WISH TO APPEAR IN COURT FOR CERTAIN SPECIFIED HEARINGS. THIS BILL SOLVES THESE ONGOING PROBLEM WITHOUT TRAMPLING WITH EXISTING LAW GOVERNING WHAT MUST HAPPEN WHEN THE DEFENDANT IS PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN COURT. AND MOTIONS TO WAIVE THEIR SUBSEQUENT PRESENTS. THIS BILL WHICH THANKS TO MODIFICATIONS REQUESTED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. HAS GREATER PROTECTIONS THAN PROVIDED BY ANY STATE. OR ENSURING- REPRESENTED DEFENDANT IN CUSTODY WHO DOES NOT WISH TO BE PHYSICALLY DRAGGED IN THE COURTS. CAN WAIVE HIS PRESENCE BUT ONLY AFTER YEARS SHE HAS BEEN FULLY INFORMED. OF ALL RELEVANT RIGHTS AND WHAT WE WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY- NOT TO BE. WE RISK ASK ME SUPPORT AND PASS AS WELL MY BITS. IMPORTANT TECHNICAL CHANGES TO THE PENAL CODE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

THANK YOU IS A CHAIR THAT WAS MY QUESTION TOO ABOUT- THE CONSENT IF YOU COULD- ANSWER THAT ARE HAVE YEAR- WITNESSES. HELP ANSWER THE QUESTION BECAUSE SOMETIMES FOLKS DON'T SHOW UP MAYBE. BECAUSE OF PHYSICAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF MENTAL ILLNESS MAYBE THEY'RE BEING RAILROADED BY THEIR OWN- COUNCIL OR THEY'RE BEING INTIMIDATED OR BULLIED IN PRISON OR IN I MEAN IN JAIL. AND SO A LOT OF THINGS CAN- COMPLICATE FOLKS IS ABILITY TO SHOW UP- OR EVEN WANT TO SHOW UP SO. JUST WANTED ANY CLARITY FROM YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER ABOUT HOW THE CONSENT HAPPENED. CHURCHILL'S INDULGENCE FINANCERS. QUESTION SO AS IT'S DRAFTED NOW AS WE HAVE AMENDED IT THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE ASSEMBLY THERE ARE SIX FINDINGS THAT MUST BE MADE BY THE COURT BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE WITH RESPECT TO EACH FACTOR ONE IS THAT THE DEFENDANT MUST BE IN CUSTODY- AND BE REFUSING WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE TO APPEAR IN COURT THAT DAY FOR TRIAL THE SECOND IS THE DEFENDER MUST BE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHT NOW THE GEISHA TO BE PERSONALLY PRESENT. THREE THE DEFENDANT MUST BE INFORMED THAT THE TRIAL WILL PROCEED WITHOUT THE DEFENDANT BEING PRESENT FOR THE DEFENDANT MUST BE INFORMED THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT DURING THE TRIAL FIVE THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN INFORMED THAT THEIR ABSENCE WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE WILL CONSTITUTE A VOLUNTARY WAIVER OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES AGAINST THEM OR TESTIFY ON THEIR BEHALF SIX THE DEFENDANT HAS BEEN INFORMED WHETHER OR NOT DEFENSE COUNSEL WILL BE PRESENT AND WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT THESE. SIX FACTORS THAT MUST EACH BE FOUND BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE BY THE COURT MUST BE FOUND ON THE RECORD THE COURT HAS TO STATE THE REASONS FOR EACH OF THE FINDINGS UNDER THE FACTORS AND THEN IF THE TRIAL LAST MORE THAN ONE DAY OR THE PRELIM LAST MORE THAN ONE DAY THE COURT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE THESE FINDINGS THE NEW ON EACH DAY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCEEDINGS SO IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE SITUATION THE SIX FACTORS MUST BE STATE ON THE RECORD BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVERY SINGLE DAY THE DEFENDANT. CONTINUES TO BE ABSENT. THANK YOU. TO SOME QUESTIONS OR ONCERNS FIVE MEMBERS AT THE SUN. KERN CHERRY NINE- WE HAVE A- TO PASS. RECOMMENDATION IS THERE A MOTION FOR THE MEASURE.

TO MOVE CUNNINGHAM THAT MEASURES OUT FIVE ZERO CONGRATULATIONS YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CENTERS NEXT UP IS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE HE HAS AB. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN SANDERS- GOOD EVENING I LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE LOS ANGELES AND SANTA CLARA COUNTY PROBATION OFFICERS WORKING WITH MY TEAM ON OUR NEW LANGUAGE AND I GLADLY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDS TODAY. I PLAN TO CONTINUE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PROBATION OFFICERS TO ADDRESS ANY OUTSTANDING CONCERNS THEY MAY HAVE ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT SIX TO ESTABLISH A PROCEDURE TO RELEASE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE TENSION THAT ONLY FACE A VIOLATION OF PROBATION. TYPICALLY WHEN YOU ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH A CRIME YOU ARE ENTITLED TO SOME FOR FREE CHAO PRE TRIAL RELEASE HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHEN IT COMES TO INDIVIDUALS ARRESTED FOR A VIOLATION OF PROBATION. EXISTING LAWS ON CLEAR ON WHETHER OR NOT A PERSON DETAINED FOLLOWING ALLEGATION OF VIOLATING PROBATION. HAS THE RIGHT TO BAIL AND OPTIONS FOR RELEASE. ARE NOT DESCRIBED MY BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE BY DIRECTING THE COURT TO RELEASE PEOPLE DETAINED ON A VIOLATION OF PROBATION. UNLESS THEY FIND AT THE INDIVIDUAL WOULD POSE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY OR DETERMINE THEIR FLIGHT RISK. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE MOST RECENT HUMPHREY'S DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT. AND STATE THAT HAVE BILLS SAID IT MUST BE SET AT A LEVEL THE PERSON CAN REASONABLY AFFORD. SO I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS REASONABLY FOR REASONABLE REFORM TO UPHOLD THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM. WHICH IS THE PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED OF ANY WRONGDOING SHOULD BE ALLOWED THE OPTION TO CONTINUE THEIR LIVES OUTSIDE DETENTION UNTIL A COURT CAN APPROPRIATELY DETERMINE. WHETHER A VIOLATION OCCURRED AND WHAT IF ANY ADDITIONAL PROBATION TERMS ARE NECESSARY- PLEASE INTRODUCE MY PRIMARY WITNESS IN SUPPORT DAVID BRINGS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CALL JUSTICE AND ASK FOR YOUR ITEM. VERY MUCH THIS BRIDGE WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY OF THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON THE LISTED CARE AND SENATORS- MY NAME IS DAVID BRIGGS I'M A ATTORNEY HAVE BEEN IN PRACTICE NOW FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. DOING CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK. AND I'M THE CO CHAIR OF. LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WE ARE THE SPONSOR OF A A. B. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT- AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD MAKE MUCH NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAY CALIFORNIA COURTS HANDLE ALLEGATIONS THAT A PERSON HAS VIOLATED PROBATION. PROBATIONERS ARE PEOPLE A JUDGE HAS DETERMINED DESERVE TO BE RELEASED INTO SOCIETY DESPITE HAVING COMMITTED A CRIME. GENERALLY THE CRIMES INVOLVED OR MISDEMEANORS OR NONVIOLENT SOMEONE'S. BEIJING IMPOSES CONDITIONS INTENDED TO REHABILITATE THE PROBATIONER SUCH AS DRUG TESTING FAMILY COUNSELING AND REPORTING TO A PROBATION OFFICER. HOWEVER A PROBATIONERS LIFE CAN BE DIFFICULT AND PROBATIONERS NOT INFREQUENTLY VIOLATE THE CONDITIONS UP THEIR PROBATION. PLEASE VIOLATIONS CAN BE RELATIVELY MINOR SUCH AS MISSING A SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT WITH THE PROBATION OFFICER. SB SEVERE SUCH AS COMMISSION OF A NEW CRIME. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT DOES NOT DEAL WITH NEW CRIMES IN A PLACES NO LIMITATION ON A PROSECUTOR'S DISCRETION TO FILE A CHARGE BASED ON THEIR CRIME. ANY SUCH CHARGE WOULD OF COURSE IMPLICATE THE DEFENDANT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS ON THE SPEEDY JURY TRIAL. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ADDRESSES PROBATION VIOLATIONS OR THERE'S NO RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. IN THE QUEUES OF VIOLATING PROBATION CAN CONTEST THE CHARGE ONLY IN A NON JURY HERE. AND THERE'S NO FOR A LIMIT ON HOW LONG THE PERSON MUST WAIT FOR THIS HEARING. CURRENTLY NO BAIL PROBATION HOLES ARE STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR FELONY CASES IN COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I'M IN MISDEMEANOR CASES ALSO PLEASE HOLD FORCED PROBATIONERS INTO JAIL FOR WEEKS OR EVEN MONTHS ON UNPROVED CHARGES. THE BILL TO CONSIDER THE DEGREE TO WHICH INCARCERATIONS WILL INTERFERE WITH THE PROBATIONERS REHABILITATION. AND THEY TAKE NO ACCOUNT OF THE SEVERITY OF THE ALLEGED VIOLATION. AB TWELVE TWENTY IT WOULD REPLACE THE SYSTEM WITH ONE BASED ON THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT'S RECENT DECISION IN IN RE HOME FOR. IN MOST CASES IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT IF ANY BAIL IS SET IT MUST BE SAID IN AN AMOUNT THE PROBATIONER CAN REASONABLY AFFORD. IT WOULD REQUIRE JUDGES TO KEEP PROBATIONER OUT OF JAIL BEFORE THEIR HEARING UNLESS JAIL IS THE ONLY MEASURE WHICH WOULD REASONABLY PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND REASONABLY ASSURE. THE PERSON'S FUTURE APPEARANCE IN COURT. AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WOULD KEEP PROBATIONERS HOME WITH THEIR FAMILIES WORKING OTHER JOBS AND PARTICIPATING IN A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAMS. BY URGING TO FURTHER THE REHABILITATION OF PROBATIONERS. BY VOTING ONLINE ON A. B. TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE BACK TO THE ROOM FORTY TWO- THREE THERE'S NO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OF AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WE'LL GO TO OUR OVERFLOW ROOM HOUSTON WHEN THEY'RE AS WELL MODERATOR OR THEIR WITNESSES SO I WOULDN'T JUST DESIRING TO TESTIFY. ON BEHALF OF AB TWELVE TWENTY. IN SPORT. YES SIR WE HAVE LEVINE EIGHTY NINE GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON HEARING SENATOR MARCHING ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. NINE ONE TWENTY TWO. GERYGONE ON BEHALF OF INITIATE JUSTICE STRONG SUPPORT. NINE TWO ZERO FOUR. PLEASE HOLD WHILE HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. NINE ONE EIGHTY SIX. K. ONE BEING A BILLIONAIRE CALIFORNIA ACTION- IN STRONG SUPPORT. BUT WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY NOW WILL MOVE TO OUR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES LISTED MODERATOR IF DANIEL SANCHEZ IS READY WE CAN HEAR TESTIMONY. ABOUT THREE MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ I'M THE OPPOSITE SHE PROBATION OFFICERS CURRENTLY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT BUT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAD I HAD FOR THE OPENNESS TO THE DISCUSSION WITH US ON THIS ISSUE PROVISIONS YOU STRONGLY SUPPORT FOSTERING ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION AND WE HAVE STRONGLY SUPPORTED REFORMS WHICH FOCUS ON APPROPRIATE RELEASED PRIOR TO CONVICTION. HOWEVER THIS BILL DIFFERS SIGNIFICANTLY AS IT APPLIES TO AN INDIVIDUAL AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND SUBSEQUENTLY VIOLATED THE TERMS OF THEIR SENTENCE- WHICH ARE TERMS OF COURSE THAT HAVE BEEN AGREED TO AS DETERMINED BY THE COURT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PROBATION. VERY MUCH UNDERSTAND THAT CHANGE IS A PROCESS AND IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES IT IS NOT IMMEDIATE- IN WORKING WITH- INDIVIDUALS- PROBATION UTILIZES RESEARCH BASED GRADUATED RESPONSES TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS PROVISION ALSO UTILIZES YOUR MORE THAN INCENTIVES TO HELP INCENTIVIZE ENGAGEMENT REHABILITATIVE PROGRAM. HE'S GRADUATED RESPONSES TO VIOLATIONS ARE STRUCTURED INCREMENTAL AND PROPORTIONAL AND INTENDED TO REFLECT A RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF. RESPONSES TO ADDRESSING BEHAVIORS. FURTHER GRADUATE RESPONSE. I USED BEFORE DETENTION WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL VIOLATE THEIR PROBATION SENTENCE. PROVISION USE OF OPTION SHORT OF FILING A REVOCATION WHEN AT ALL POSSIBLE AND WE AGREE THAT INCARCERATION SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE IT AS A NECESSARY RESPONSE WITH SERIOUS RISKS ARE PRESENT. WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BY SETTING UP A PRESUMPTION FOR RELEASE. IN INSTANCES WHERE A VIOLATION OF THE COURT'S ORDERS HAVE OCCURRED AND ONE OTHER GRADUATED SANCTIONS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS AND OR SERIOUS ARREST PRESENTED TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR THE COMMUNITY. AND THERE ARE SOME- IMPLEMENTATION- QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK TO RUN WORK THROUGH AS WELL. WE WORK EVERY DAY TO HELP OUR CLIENTS MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATION MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADDICTION TREATMENT COUNSELING EDUCATION. JOB TRAINING AND STABLE HOUSING. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ACTIVE TIME BASED ON SOME OF THE- IMPACTS AND THIS RELATES TO ADDRESSING VIOLATIONS OF THE COURTS CONDITIONS. AND WE DO CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD- IN LIGHT OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE ARE BEING DISCUSSED IN PROPOSED WITH FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU RICHARD JR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY WHICH WOULD PERMIT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO REQUEST AND RECEIVE ARREST INFORMATION FOR SPECIFIC NON SWORN EMPLOYEES. LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD NARROW THE REST OR DETENTIONS SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE TO SERIOUS AND- BELLAMY FELONIES THOSE DEFINED AS CRIMES INVOLVING DISHONESTY OR INSTRUCTION OF LEGAL PROCESSES. KERN ALLOW CURRENT LAW ALLOWS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE AGENCY TO COMPLETE THE BACKGROUND CHECK ON APPLICANTS FOR NON SWORN POSITIONS AND OUTS AND INDIVIDUAL ABOUT PRIOR ARREST. HOWEVER DUE TO A LOOPHOLE IN THE LAW ONCE AN APPLICANT IS HIRED THE AGENCY CANNOT REQUEST OR RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT A NON SWORN EMPLOYEES ABOUT ANY FUTURE ARREST. THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WOULD ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO INVESTIGATE WHEN NON SWORN EMPLOYEES ARE RESTED WHICH WOULD HELP SAFEGUARD THE INTEGRITY OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WITH ME THAT TODAY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS IS- CHAU MUTCHLER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION. MOST OF YOU READY YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY.

FOR WORKING WITH US COLLABORATIVE LEAD TO- COME UP WITH THESE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND- WE ARE PLEASED THAT THE BILL I WILL BE MOVING FORWARD HOPEFULLY REPEAT PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- WE THINK THAT IN THE SPIRIT OF CONSTANT TRANSPARENCY AND ENSURING THAT EMPLOYEES REMAIN OF THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY.

ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR. LIFE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
