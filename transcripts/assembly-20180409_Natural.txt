VERY MUCH MISTER DONALD FLOOR IS YOURS. A GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR FOUR WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE CAP ON THE OIL TRUST FUND. AND HELP ENSURE THE CLEAN UP OF ABANDONED WELLS IN MY DISTRICT. THE LONG BEACH THAILAND'S ARE HOME TO THE WILMINGTON OIL FIELD. ONE ARE LARGEST OIL AND NATURAL GAS FIELDS IN THE NATION. THE FEEL PRODUCES APPROXIMATELY FORTY SIX THOUSAND BARRELS OFFER OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED ACTIVE WELLS A YEAR. BECAUSE HE'S OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED ON STATE LANDS ENTRUSTED TO THE CITY OF LONG BEACH THE STATE RECEIVES A SHARE OF THE NET PROFITS. FROM THESE OPERATIONS. HOWEVER THESE WELLS WILL NOT RUN FOR EVER. AND CURRENT PROJECTIONS ESTIMATED OIL OPERATIONS WILL CEASE AROUND THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY SIX. TO ENSURE THE STATE HAS THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO DECOMMISSION THE WELLS AND MITIGATE POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE CREATED THE OIL TRUST FUND. A PORTION OF THE STATE'S SHARE OF THE NET PROFITS BEGAN GOING IN THE FUN WITH THE INTENT OF COVERING THE EVENTUAL DECOMMISSIONING COSTS WHEN THESE OPERATIONS CEASE. AT THAT TIME A CAP OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WAS PLACED ON THE FUND BASED ON THE PREMISE THAT WE SHOULDN'T SAY MORE MONEY. THAN IS NECESSARY. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THE OIL TRUST FUND REACHED THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CAP. ESTIMATES PLACE THE STATE'S EVENTUAL COSTS OF CLEANING UP THE WELLS AT EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. THIS WILL LEAVE THE STATE WITH A SHORTFALL OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL LIKELY HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE STATE GENERAL FUND. WE MUST ALLOW THE OIL TRUST FUND TO KEEP GROWING TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET THE STATE'S OBLIGATION TO CLEAN UP THIS OIL FIELD. AB TWO THOUSAND TO AB TWENTY FOUR A FOUR ELIMINATES THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CAP WHICH WILL ALLOW THE FUND TO GROW AND COVER THE COSTS OF THE EVENTUAL OIL CLEANUP.

AND THE ESTIMATED EVENTUAL LIABILITY WITH THE OPERATIONS AND IN AROUND TWENTY THIRTY OR SO SO WE THINK THAT SPELL. IS AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR THE STATE TO ENSURE ITS BUILT UP SUFFICIENT FUNDING SO IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE READY TO PAY FOR THOSE COSTS WHICH ARE THE STATE'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE OPERATIONS AND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF LONG BEACH.

AND THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR ACCOMMODATING ME AND MY WITNESS YET TO LEAVE TO GET HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND I'M ALSO. THINKING MEMBERS FOR GIVING YOUR ATTENTION TODAY. I ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY SIX IS A SIMPLE BILL AS WE LIKE STAY IN THE ASSEMBLY. AS YOU ALL KNOW ONE OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS FACING CALIFORNIA'S THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES FAMILIES ARE SPENDING OVER A THIRD OF THEIR PAYCHECK. JUST TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR CHILDREN'S HEADS AND ONLY ONE THIRD OF FAMILIES CAN AFFORD A MEDIUM SIZED. UP MEDIATISED PRAISE HOME IN CALIFORNIA. THE KYROCKETING COST OF HOUSING HAS LED TO A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE LADIES AND GENTLEMAN MORE THAN A QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY'S HOMELESS POPULATION RIGHT HERE IN OUR HOME STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS IS HOW DO YOU HOUSING SHORTAGE IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT BUT A PROBLEM THAT THE LEGISLATURE. HAS CREATED IN YEARS PAST AND REFUSE TO ADDRESSED. THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE MEANT TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT HAVE INSTEAD BEEN USED AS A WEAPON FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES AND OTHER INTEREST GROUPS TO BLOCK PROJECTS TO FURTHER THEIR OWN AGENDA. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN ALONE SEQUEL LAWSUITS BLOCKED NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES. THEY PEOPLE COULD HAVE MOVED INTO WITH THEIR FAMILIES. THE TIMES WERE. PLANNED TO BE BUILT ON VACANT LOTS BY THE WAY THERE IS NOTHING THAT NEEDED TO BE TORN DOWN IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE ITS DEVELOPMENT. THE ELLIOTTS OFFICE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND UNITS OF HOUSING PER YEAR JUST TO KEEP UP WITH THE POPULATION GROWTH. IT'S A DO TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE ACTS IMPASSES NEEDS TO COR FOR HIM TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EVERYONE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS DEBORAH DEBORAH CARLTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AND JOHN GAMBOA FROM THE TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATION A STATEWIDE COALITION OF ADVOCATES WORKING ON BEHALF. OF LOW INCOME MINORITIES HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS MEMBERS I AM I KNOW IT'S NOT AN EASY TOPIC BUT I AM GOING TO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I THINK JOHN IS GOING TO STE TO START. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO ADDRESS YOU ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. TO MOST PEOPLE. HOUSE SCENE IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS SAY. ADEQUATE SHELTER ISSUE. FOR MINORITIES IN THE UNDERSERVED IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS IT IN ECONOMIC JUSTICE ISSUE. ON IT. MARTIN LUTHER KING. FIFTY WE'VE BEEN CELEBRATING HIS JET RECENTLY AND IS WORTH A. STATED SUCCINCTLY THAT. CIVIL THERE IS NO CIVIL RIGHTS WITHOUT ECONOMIC JUSTICE. ON IT. FIFTY YEARS AGO ALSO PRESIDENT JOHNSON. PUT TOGETHER THE KERNER COMMISSION. TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. THE COMMISSION CAME UP WITH. THREE CAUSES FOR THOSE RIGHTS. ONE WAS RAMPANT RACISM THE OTHER ONE WAS HOUSING OF SEGREGATION AND THE LAST WAS AGGRESSIVE POLICING AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. A KIND OF STILL RESOUNDS TODAY RIGHT ON IT. RIGHT AFTER THAT. THE. FOR FIFTY YEARS AFTER THAT THE UPDATE ON THE KERNER COMMISSION FONG. THAT THERE WAS NO CHANGE AND IN FACT. THE WEALTH GAP IN THIS COUNTRY HAD INCREASED. THE REASON I RAISE THIS IS BECAUSE. HOUSING THEM HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS THE MAJOR AVENUE TO WEALTH ACCUMULATION IN THIS COUNTRY. HOMEOWNERSHIP FROM NINETEEN THIRTY TO NINETEEN SEVENTY CREATED THE GREATEST MIDDLE CLASS THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN. BECAUSE IT SUBSIDIZED HOUSING AND MORTGAGES FOR QUITE FAMILIES UNFORTUNATELY IT LEFT MINORITY COMMUNITIES BEHIND ON IT. MINORITY COMMUNITIES NINETEEN SEVENTY STARTED CATCHING UP. BECAUSE OF THE FAIR. LET. FAIR LAWS AROUND NOW EQUAL ON THEM PREDICT ACT ON AND AS WE STARTED CLOSING THAT GAP MONEY. THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP. ALL OF A SUDDEN. THE GREAT HOOK. THE CALL NOW THE RECESSION CAME ABOUT AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED MINORITY COMMUNITIES BLACK AND LATINOS LOST. THIRTY YEARS OF WEALTH AND JUST THREE. WE WERE BACK TO WHERE WE WHERE. RIGHT AFTER THE ALL OF THE RED LINE UNIT TAKEN PLACE WHEN. YESTERDAY. IN THE NEW YORK TIMES THE MAJOR EDITORIAL CAME OUT AND STATED. AND I QUOTE IT. SIR I UP. JUST LOOKED UP AT MY CLOCK HERE AND THAT YOU HAVE EXCEEDED YOUR TIME IF YOU CAN TRY TO WRAP UP OKAY I'LL JUST SAVE VERY QUICKLY ON. THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THE STATE IS. THE MISUSE OF SEQUEL SEQUEL IS ONE OF THE GREATEST. LEGISLATION THAT WERE PASSED IN THE STATE BUT IT'S BEEN MISUSED BECAUSE THERE'S TWO LOOPHOLES. ONE IS YOU CAN FILE ANONYMOUSLY YOU DON'T HAVE TO PUT YOUR NAME ON THE. ON THE BILL TO BLOCK ANY HOUSING IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE SECOND IS YOU CAN FILE A LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT DELAY CONSTRUCTION. OF OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS HONEY. WHAT'S COME ABOUT THAT IS LEFT OUR COMMUNITY SO FAR SO FAR BEHIND I URGE YOU IN OUR ORGANIZATION URGES YOU. TO AT LEAST PASS THIS BILL AND LET IT GET TO THE FULL FLOOR. TO ALL OUR LEGISLATORS AND IN THE STATE CAN VOTE ON IT THANK YOU. THE THING WAS CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS KEEP DONE FILLING IN FOR DEMOCRATS AND FOR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION COMPANY PARTNER SOCIAIS XIN HAS LONG RECOGNIZED AND HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE BEST WAY TO BUILD UP COMMUNITIES TO HAVE THEM INVESTED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE. A STABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR FAMILIES FOR SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE OUR CHILDREN AND TO MOVE THEM FORWARD IN THE ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT IS CALIFORNIA WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING. INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING. WE THINK THIS IS A A NOVEL APPROACH ONE THAT WE'VE TRIED BEFORE. BUT BUT MEETING THE HOUSING NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS REMAINS CRITICAL SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A STRONG MIDDLE CLASS A TRAINED AND SKILLED WORKFORCE TO HELP US BUILD CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT THEY'RE WORKING. WE ENCOURAGE SUPPORT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE PROVIDE HOUSING FOR WORKERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ON BOB BREMER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. YEAH WE COVERAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS ALSO IN SUPPORT THINK YOU. AT A RALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SEEING NO FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT TO HAVE WHAT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON COW JONES THE SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA OPPOSED TO THIS BILL TODAY OUT WE AGREE THAT THERE IS A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA BUT NOT THAT SEEK WHAT IS THE STANDALONE BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS THAT WE FACE NOW. WE HAVEN'T SEEN DATA OUT THERE TO POINT DEFINITIVELY THAT IT IS JUST SEQUENCE EQUAL LOAN THAT IS CAUSING. THE PRICES OF HOUSING TO SOAR THERE'S OBVIOUSLY NUMEROUS FACTORS IN THAT AND FORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON LITIGATION RATES. WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON THE AMOUNT OF THE. TOTAL CASES FILED OR OR HOW THOSE RESULT SO WITHOUT THAT DATA IS IT'S REALLY HARD TO JUST SAY THAT THIS IS THE PROBLEM. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH. THE PROPOSALS IN THIS BILL. REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION ARE BY LIMITING INJUNCTIONS ON CASES ARE YOU THERE CAN BE SOMEWHAT PERVERSE OUTCOMES. UP FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE SEEN THAT WERE INJUNCTIONS WERE NOT SOCCER GRANTED IN PROJECTS THAT. THE COURTS CAN ACTUALLY ORDER DEMOLITION IF THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THE LAW. IF SUBSEQUENTLY I OURS ARE REQUIRED I'M I THINK IT DOES PUT A LOT OF UNDUE PRESSURE ON LEAD AGENCIES ANALYZING THESE CASES. TO BUT NOT GO AHEAD WITH WITH ANY ANY CHANGES TO THE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY BUILT OUT. AND THIS COULD LEAD TO UNINTENTIONAL IMPACTS IN COMMUNITIES THAT GO ON MEDICAID IT. I'LL THERE ARE ALREADY REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO MEET INJUNCTIONS AND WE THINK IT WAS INSUFFICIENT UP FOR SEQUEL PURPOSES. AND SO WE JUST DON'T THINK THIS OUT THIS BILL. THIS BILL WILL HAVE MORE PROBLEMS THAN THAN WHAT SIX TO SOFTEN SO WHAT WE ARE CHEN ABOUT. TURN MEMBERS TAMPON FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE JEWISH COUNCIL IS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. FOR REASONS A SIMILAR TO THAT THIRTY. OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE BEEN PENDING OVER. THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. A BIT OF GOOD BEEN DESIGNED TO EITHER EXPEDITE. SEVERELY EXPEDITE THE JUDICIAL REVIEW TIME LINES ARE PROVIDE THE SAME KIND THE LIMITS ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. TO BE CLEAR OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT BASED ON ANY POSITIONS ON SEQUEL OR THE MERITS OF THE PARTICULAR HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY THIS LEGISLATION. THOSE ARE POLICY ISSUES OUTSIDE OUR PURVIEW OUR SOLE FOCUS OR IS ON WHAT THE COURT IMPACT THE ADVERSE COURT IMPACTS LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. NOT RESULT IN THE COURTS HAVE BROAD EQUITABLE POWERS IN EVERY CASE INCLUDING SECRET MATTERS. A FASHION AN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF WHEN VIOLATIONS OF BEEN FOUND BASED ON THE RECORD IN FRONT OF THE COURT. AND APPLICABLES LA IT IS OFTEN THE CASE ARE SECRETIVE JUST TELL US. THAT THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS FLAWED AND NEEDS TO START OVER THERE TARGETED SPECIFIC AREAS. OF NONCOMPLIANCE IN THE COURT BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS A ISSUES AN INJUNCTION THAT IS TARGETED TO REMEDYING THOSE PARTICULAR VIOLATIONS BILLS LIKE THIS SAY THAT THE COURT IS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED. FROM ISSUING SUCH A TARGETED INJUNCTION REGARDLESS OF THE FACTS. AND THE LAWN IN FRONT OF THE COURT IN ITS FOR THOSE REASONS IN THE COUNCIL RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY UP FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. SEEING NINE COMING FORWARD USE THAT THE UNIVERSITY. I MATTHEW FIGURE WITH A P. C. OPENING CONSERVATION THE WE OPPOSE THE BILL. FOR THE. STATEMENTS MADE PREVIOUSLY. ANY OTHER WITNESSES. SEEN AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR ACOSTA. BOB. THANK YOU. MS ONE IS FOR BRING IN THE BILL IN FEAR YOUR WITNESS. I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE SIERRA CLUB REPRESENTED THAT'S OKAY. I'M GONNA I'M GONNA PASS ON THAT I WILL JUST SAY THIS THAT I'M HERE HAVING SO MANY SICK RELATED ISSUES IN MY DISTRICT. THERE'S THERE'S FRANKLY SEEK WAS. A LANDMARK LEGISLATION AYE YOUR WITNESS US ARE YOU YOU MENTION WHAT WHAT WHAT THE. LANDMARK LEGISLATION IT IS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ALL WANT TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE. YOU KNOW NOT ONLY WERE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE ONE APPROACH PROTECT PRESERVE THOSE BUT OUR QUALITY AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. BUT PART OF THAT. IT IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US AS WELL AS LEGISLATE TOURS. THAT WE ALSO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THIS STATE. AND I APPLAUD YOU BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW VARIOUS ARENAS AND STADIUMS AND FRANKLY THE CAPITAL ANNEX THAT IS PROPOSED RIGHT HERE IT'S AT. THE STATE CAPITOL THAT WHILE WILL BE GRANTED OR IS. PROPOSED TO BE GRANTED A IN SOME FORM OF SECRET RELIEF WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE. HEARINGS IN THIS VERY CHAMBER REGARDING SEEK RELIEF FOR THOSE VERY STADIUMS AND ARENAS THAT I'M ALL FOR THEY CREATE JOBS. IN IN IN ECONOMIC VITALITY IN OUR DISTRICTS IN OUR COMMUNITY IN THE STATE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE HAVE A PLACE FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO LIVE. AND THIS IS A PIECE OF THAT. ALSO THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND. MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT THE COURTS WILL THE COURTS ARE THERE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC. AND IF WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE COURTS THAT WE SHOULD TAKE IT WE SHOULD GO INTO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND AND ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND ADDRESS THEM. SATISFACTORILY IN THE BUDGET BECAUSE IF YOU ARE DENIED YOUR DAY IN COURT FOLKS. YOU'RE YOUR YOUR JUSTICES TONIGHT THAT'S ALL OFTENTIMES IF JUSTICE DELAYED IS JUSTICE DENIED AS THE EXPRESSION GOES. SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS I DID SECOND TO THE MOTION BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO TAKE A VERY GOOD SERIOUS HARD LOOK AT WHETHER IT'S THIS BILL OR ANOTHER BILL. I JUST BE. JUST PREDISPOSED TO THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US BUT I DID MAKE AMENDMENTS IN THIS VERY COMMITTEE LAST YEAR ON THIS VERY ISSUE. THAT WE'RE IN I WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT THE POINT IS IS THAT WE NEED TO MILLION UNITS IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NEVER GONNA GET THERE IF WE KEEP SAYING IT'S A. IT'S ONLY PART OF THE PROBLEM IS ALL THESE OTHER ISSUES LET'S TACKLE THIS ONE THAT WILL MOVE ON TO JUDICIARY WILL MOVE ON THE LABOR WILL MOVE ON TO OTHER ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THEN WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A PLACE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND AFFORDABLE RATE AS OPPOSED TO. A HAVING THE MOVE OUT OF STATE WHICH IS HAPPENING. RIGHT LEFT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS THE BILL. VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE FROM THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO. ASK QUESTIONS SAYING NONE. MISS SURE I'M MS MELENDEZ. SO. MY CONCERN. IS THAT. WHILE. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT. WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. MY CONCERN IS IS THAT YOUR BILL SEEKS A. ENTIRE CATEGORICAL. LIMITATION TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR ALL NEW HOUSING. AND. IT IS MY OPINION THAT THE WILD. YOU KNOW EVER SINCE I FIRST CAME UP HERE WITH YOU IN TWENTY TWELVE I'VE BEEN. OPEN TO IDEAS ON. HOW TO? IMPROVE SEQUEL HOW TO. CUT DOWN ON THE ABUSES. WITH A SEQUEL LITIGATION. BUT I. I DO NOT SEE THAT WITH THIS BILL IN TERMS OF A CATEGORICAL. LIMITATION ON INJUNCTIVE RELIEF FOR ALL NEW HOUSING. ONE TO GIVE YOUR RESPONSE CHEST WAS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. IT AND I'D. YOU KNOW I WILL SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT WE YOU AND I CAME UP HERE AT THE SAME TIME IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THINGS GET BETTER. THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE SEEN HOMELESSNESS INCREASE WE'VE SEEN AYE THE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING UNITS FOR PEOPLE. STIFLE MORE AND MORE OVER THE YEARS SO WE CONTINUE TO HAVE WITNESSES COME TO THIS COMMITTEE. WHEN WE HAVE BILLS LIKE THAT WHETHER IT'S DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN AND WE PLAY THIS GAME OF HIDE THE P.. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T DO THIS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO THAT WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO THIS AND WE'LL JUST KEEP MOVING. ALL THE PARTS AROUND UNTIL WE NEVER DO ANYTHING AND THAT'S ON HELPING ANYWAY. WE WE HAVE MORE THAN A FOURTH OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOT SAYING THAT EVERYONE OF THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE HOMELESS WOULD ULTIMATELY WIND UP PURCHASING A HOME ARE RENTING A HOME BUT A VAST MAJORITY OF THAT WOULD. AND THAT'S A REALITY THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA HASN'T GOTTEN BETTER WALK AROUND IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO MY GOODNESS THAT'S GOT CERTAINLY GOTTEN WORSE GO DOWN TO ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THEY HAVE MILES. AND TENT CITIES. FOR PEOPLE WHO WHO DON'T HAVE HOMES THIS IS A MODEST PROPOSAL I GET IT I KNOW PEOPLE GET. THEY GET LEERY THEY GET TIMID THE SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS COMMAND THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO PROTECT THEIR TURF I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT AT SOME POINT WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE TO JUST. SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO ALL THE NOISE OUT THERE WE'RE GONNA LISTEN TO WHAT'S IN OUR HEAD BUT IS WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE TRUE AND THAT WILL BE HELPFUL. TO CALIFORNIANS AND WE'RE JUST GONNA. RIP THE BANDAID OFF IN MARCH FORWARD AND DO WHAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING. WE KEEP GOING IN CIRCLES. AND I JUST IT IT IT SADDENS ME TO LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE HOMES A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUY HIM BUT CAN'T AFFORD IT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO JUST THERE JUST ARE NO HOMES AVAILABLE EVEN IF THEY COULD AFFORD IT THIS IS. THIS IS RIDICULOUS WE I'M ASKING YOU I JUST JOIN ME IN THIS MODEST EFFORT BELIEVE ME I WOULD LIKE TO DO MUCH OF. OUR BUT I KNOW BETTER THAN TO BRING THAT BILL TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT I THINK THIS IS MODEST AND I THINK THIS WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS YOUR CONSTITUENTS IN MIND THIS IS HOUSING IS IN A PARTISAN ISSUE SO WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN.

IT'S ESTIMATED THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ABANDONED VESSELS. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE TO COMPLETELY ERADICATE. THESE VESSELS POSE A DIRECT THREAT TO THE DELTA ENVIRONMENT THE NAVIGATION OF THE DELTA AND THE ENTIRE STATE'S WATER QUALITY. THEY LEACH OF ASBESTOS LEAD PETROLEUM AND MANY OTHER DANGEROUS TOXINS INTO OUR WATER SUPPLY. ACCORDING TO A RECENT AERIAL SURVEY. THERE ARE ABOUT FIFTY FOUR BANDICOOTS OF VESSELS IN THE DELTA REGION AND AND WILL COST THOUSAND TO REMOVE. UNLIKE RECREATIONAL VESSELS COMMERCIAL VESSELS TO NOT HAVING ANY AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR REMOVAL. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE WOULD RE DIRECT STATE PROPERTY LEASE REVENUE. WITHIN THE FIVE DELTA COUNTY COUNTIES OF CONTRA COSTA SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN SOLANO AND YOLO. INTO A NEW ACCOUNT FOR THE REMOVAL OF ABANDON COMMERCIAL VESSELS OR SKIN IN THE GAME. THIS NEW ACCOUNT WOULD BE MANAGED BY THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AS THEY WOULD WORK WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO REMOVE THESE ABANDONED VESSELS. WITH ME TODAY'S SERGEANT MIKE BERRY.

THEN TRAFFIC OTHER HUMANS AND THEY BECOME LIKE FLOATING LITTLE LITTLE ISLANDS OF OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T WANT GOING ON. THEM AND WHEN THE TIME TO PUT IT LIKE TO BE AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU'D BE SO KIND. JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. I AM SIXTEEN AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY ONE BY MEMBER FRAZIER DO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MURATSUCHI. MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA. BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA AYE FLORA AYE LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ. LINDA'S AYE STONE. SEVEN ZERO. SOME TIME CELEBRATE MY FIRST ONE OF THE OUT OF THIS COMPUTER. ALRIGHT NEXT WE HAVE MISTER GRAYSON. AND THIS IS. AB TWENTY NINETY ONE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINETY ONE. FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHORS AMENDMENTS. AS AMENDED AB TWENTY NINETY ONE ESTABLISHES A PRESCRIBED BURN MANAGER CERTIFICATE OF SPECIAL WITH A SPECIALIZATION WITHIN THE LICENSED PROFESSIONAL FORSTER PROGRAM. AND TASK CALIFORNIA WITH CREATING AN INSURANCE OPTION FOR CERTIFIED BURN MANAGES TO LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE LIABILITY PROTECTION. THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS ONE ASPECT OF OUR RESPONSE TO THE DEVASTATING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WILDFIRE SEASON. WHICH IS THE NEED TO INCREASE THE SCALE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AS A BENEFICIAL FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE. REPORTS ON FORCED HEALTH RELEASED BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE AND THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION BOTH ADVOCATE FOR MORE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S FOREST INCLUDING THE INCREASED USE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE. HOWEVER LIABILITY CONCERNS AND THE COST OF INSURANCE HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN CITED AS ROADBLOCKS TO THE USE OF. SCRIBE FIRE WHILE INSURANCE FOR LANDOWNERS AND PRACTITIONERS IS AVAILABLE IT IS OFTEN PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. AB TWENTY NINETY ONE ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE IN TWO STEPS FIRST IT ESTABLISHES A PRESCRIBED BURN MANAGER CERTIFICATE OF SPECIALIZATION WITHIN THE LICENSE PROFESSIONAL FORSTER PROGRAM. THE BOARD OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE TRAINING. EXAMINING AND REGISTERING PROFESSIONAL FORESTERS THEREFORE IT'S THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO TAKE ON THIS TASK SECOND IT DIRECTS CAL FIRE TO DEVELOP AN INSURANCE OPTION FOR CERTIFIED BURN MANAGERS THAT WOULD LOWER COST. AND IMPROVE LIABILITY PROTECTION. NO THIS BILL IS NOT PRESCRIPTIVE AS TO THAT TYPE OF PRODUCT THE CALIFORNIA AIR SHOULD OFFER IS MY FACT IT DOES REQUIRE THE GOAL THAT THE OPTION INCREASE THE USE. A PRESCRIBED FIRE I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE WHITE WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS TO REFINE AND IMPROVE THIS BILL SO THAT IT ACHIEVES ITS GOAL OF GETTING MORE FIRE ON THE LAND IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUING TOAPPROVE THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD. YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE A WITNESSES AND. I DO. ALLY THEMSELF INTRODUCE. GOOD MORNING ARE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL MASON FOR PACIFIC FOREST TRUST. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THEM LIMON GRAYSON'S WORK ON THIS ISSUE IT'S BEEN GRATIFYING TO SEE THE LEVEL OF ATTENTION. TO THE INCREASED USE OF PROACTIVE PRESCRIBED FIRE AS AN ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION AND MAINTENANCE TOOL. WROTE PRETTY AT THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE OTHER. IS A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS DEALING WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE AND ECOSYSTEM RESILIENCE AND THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD THROUGH THE PROCESS TO ALIGN THOSE DIFFERENT BILLS. THERE'S A BILL BY MISTER WOULD INVITE HIM SENATOR JACKSON IN THIS BILL. COMMIT ONGOING CONVERSATION WE ARE MUCH APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BRINGING THESE ISSUES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER. WITNESSES AND SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. TWITTER'S. SINGLE PICKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION BUT WE'VE SUBMITTED LETTERS. JUST TRYING TO. PUT OUT THERE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT A COMPREHENSIVE PRESCRIBED BURN. LEGISLATION WOULD WOULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT COMPONENTS WE THINK ARE NECESSARY IN ORDER FOR FOLKS TO ACTUALLY. BE ABLE TO START USING PRESCRIBED BURN. WE THINK THAT LIABILITY FOR SOME FOREMOST HAS TO BE ADDRESSED. EITHER BY. USING PRIMA FISHEL LANGUAGE OR BY. CHANGING NEGLIGENCE TO. A HIGHER. BURDEN. WE ALSO THINK THAT INSURANCE NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED CURRENTLY PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE FOUR FOUR SEVEN SIX STATES THAT CAL FIRE IN ITS DISCRETION MAY PURCHASE A THIRD PARTY LIABILITY. POLICY OF INSURANCE THAT PROVIDES COVERAGE AGAINST LOS. BUT IF THEY ELECT NOT TO PURCHASE THE INSURANCE THEY MUST AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE PERSON OR PUBLIC AGENCY IN CURRENTLY THAT ISN'T HAPPENING IN THE CONTRACTS. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THE CERTIFIED BURNERS. AND THAT CAL FIRE. HAS A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WHOSE EXPERTISE IS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF WORK HOWEVER. THOSE FOLKS ARE ALSO DOING MULTIPLE JOBS AT THE SAME TIME AND AS THE STATE MOVES TO YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON. THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THAT KIND OF WORK BECOME UNAVAILABLE. WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE TALKING ABOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE AS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN USE TO HELP US GET OUT OF THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN NOW WITH THE FOREST. THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY TOOL WE NEED TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO USE. PARTICULARLY MECHANICAL THINNING AND ORDER TO HAVE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PRESCRIBED BURNS THAT WE CAN OUT THERE. IN MOST CASES WE HAVE TO DO MECHANICAL THINNING FIRST AND FOREMOST UNLIKE SURE THOSE ISSUES ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND. AND OTHER ISSUES THAT MAY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED ARE THINGS LIKE. GETTINGAIR PERMIT AND AVAILABILITY OF THOSE KINDS OF OF. I ISSUES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT HER FOLKS BUT WE HAVE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLYMAN GRAYSON WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HIM. AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION FOR PRESCRIBED FOR. MR MEMBERS BRIAN WHITE HERE FOR CALVET ELECTIONS FORCE ASSOCIATION FORCED LANDINGS OF CALIFORNIA WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A POSITION AT THIS TIME BUT WE HAVEN'T SHE DISCUSSIONS WITH. GRAYSON WEEK WE APPRECIATE HIM FOR NOTICES BILL TO GET THE DISCUSSION STARTED I I THINK WE SHARE SOME THE SAME CONCERNS PARTICULAR LIABILITY. IT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENT TO TRY TO GET THESE PRESCRIBED BURNS STARTED. AND I THINK THE OTHER AIR QUALITY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THE AIRPORT. HOW WE ADDRESS THAT AS WELL BUT WE LOOK TOWARD WORK WITH THE AUTHOR IN THIS BILL FOR? ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND ONLY SERVER WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN THE NOTICES WORK IN PROGRESS BUT WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISS THE MARK WELL I'LL JUST COMMENT THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT CONSIDERING SOME OF THE WILD FIRES WE HAD AND I KNOW IT'S PART OF A GREATER CONVERSATION THE STATE SO I APPRECIATE BRING IT FORWARD AND WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THANK MS EGGMAN. AND ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE YOU'RE AT THE TABLE AND MEETING WITH EVERYBODY TO TRY TO GET SOMETHING THAT'S MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL FOR OFFICE SPACE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. OCEAN MOVES AND SECONDED. SO MISTER GRAYSON AND I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT. SEEM TO HAVE BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS THAT THIS IS A A GOOD EFFORT AND AND THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE WE ARE. SURE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND SO. BUT THAT. SHARES RECOMMENDATION IS TO. DO PASS AS AMENDED. AND WITH THAT. ROLL CALL PLEASE. I DO NINE AB TWENTY NINETY ONE BY MEMBER GRAYSON THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS BROUGHT TO TREAT AYE ROUTE TO GI ACOSTA. LOU. BLOOM AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA I LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY I MELENDEZ LINDA'S AYE STONE. SEVEN ZERO. BILLS OUT FLICK ASHES. ALRIGHT NEXT TO HAVE MISTER BERMAN WITH AB TWENTY NINE OH EIGHT FLOOR IS YOURS. THE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES KNOW ME START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR HER WORK ON THIS BILL AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF IT. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS CRACKING DRAFTING ERRORS. INCORRECT DATES ON PAGES NOT ON PAGE NINE LINE SEVEN IN TEN WHICH WERE NOT UPDATED FROM THE PREVIOUS BILL CORRECTING A MISSPELLING AND FILLING IN A BLANK DATE WITH. THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO I'LL BE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS. MEMBERS CALIFORNIANS GENERATE FORTY FOUR MILLION USED TO TIRES EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE TIRES HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT. ILLEGALLY DUMPED TIRES POSE A SIGNIFICANT COST TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE. AND AND THE STATE. LARGE ABANDONED HIGHER POWERS HAVE RESULTED IN WEEKS LONG FIRES AND THE OVERALL RECYCLING RATE HAS GONE DOWN THE LAST FOUR YEARS. IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE TIRE RECYCLING KALRA CYCLE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENT AN EXPANDED INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES PAYMENTS FOR DIVIDE FOR DESIRED AND USES OF TIRES. AB TWENTY NINE OH WAIT WOULD CREATE THE TIRE RECYCLING INCENTIVE PROGRAM HELP EXPAND THE STATE'S TIRE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. CREATE JOBS AND CUT THE STATEWIDE AND LOCAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER PILE CLEANUP AND ILLEGALLY DUMPED TIRES. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WOULD EMPLOY A PROVEN MODEL OF PERFORMANCE BASED INCENTIVE FUNDING. SUPPORT THE USE OF RUBBERIZED PAVEMENT AND OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCT USES FOR RECYCLED TIRES. IT WOULD AUTHORIZE AN INCENTIVE PAYMENT TO END USERS OF RECYCLED TIRES INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT USED TIRES AS RUBBERIZED PAVEMENT. AND MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE CONSUMER PRODUCTS USING RECYCLED TIRES. THE FUN THIS NEW PROGRAM COVER CYCLE WITH FIRST EXHAUST ANY SURPLUS DOLLARS IN THE CALIFORNIA TIRE RECYCLING MANAGEMENT FIVE. ONCE THE TIRE FUND SURPLUSES DRAWN DOWN COVER CYCLE WILL BE AUTHORIZED TO ESTABLISH THE CALIFORNIA TIRE REGULATORY FEE AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED ONE DOLLAR PER TIRE. IN ORDER TO COVER ITS COSTS OF REGULATING WASTE TIRES. IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THE FEE IS PROPERLY SET AND REYES IS ONLY THE AMOUNT NEEDED TOWER CYCLE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT A FEE IMPLEMENTATION REGULATIONS. TO IMPLEMENT THE FEE AND HAVE A PUBLIC PROCESS FOR SETTING THE FEE AND FOR FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS. COLLEAGUES THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT OUR CURRENT TIRE RECYCLING PROGRAM IS NOT GENERATING THE RESULTS THAT WE NEED. AND ESTABLISHING THIS NEW TIRE RECYCLING INCENTIVE PROGRAM WOULD RESULT IN REDUCED POLLUTION AND ILLEGAL DUMPING WHILE ALSO CREATING NEW JOBS AND STIMULATING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY NINE OH EIGHT. AND I HAVE. EXPERTS HERE TO TESTIFY AS WELL. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE OF THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS COMMITTEE IS SEEN IN ADVANCE TO THE SAME PROPOSAL THIS IS THE THIRD TIME ON THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE AND WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT IN THE PAST. THE. BUT IN THE LAST YEAR THE RECYCLING RATE IN THE RECOVERY RATE FOR TIRES CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND CONSUMERS ARE SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY MOVING TIRES AROUND BUT THOSE TIRES ARE NOT GETTING RECYCLED. THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT. SHIFTING THE PARADIGM WITH REGARD TO THE TIRE RECYCLING PROGRAM SO THAT INSTEAD OF FOCUSING THE DOLLARS ALL AT THE BACKEND WHERE CONSUMERS ARE CHARGE FOR THE DISPOSAL THE TIRES. WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THE INCENTIVES AT THE END USE THAT WE DESIRE AT THE NINETY PERCENT RECYCLING AND USE THAT IS IN THE LEGISLATION. THIS PROGRAM IS MODELED AFTER EXISTING RECYCLING INCENTIVES PROGRAMS WE HAVE FOR ELECTRONIC WASTE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND OTHER MATERIALS WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS WE KNOW HOW TO GET THESE TIRES RECYCLED AND TO. THE THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE. AND THAT HIGHEST AND BEST USE ISN'T JUST UP APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF RECOVERING THOSE TIRES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ILLEGALLY DUMPED TIRES WE DON'T HAVE TIRES GOING TO LAND FULLER WE DON'T HAVE TIRES BEING BURNED. YOU KNOW THAT WHEN WE UTILIZE THOSE TIRES AS RIVER PAVING MATERIALS IT MAKES FOR BETTER. LONGER LASTING ROADS THAT ARE QUIETER ON AND THAT ULTIMATELY SAVE. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT MONEY SO WE HAVE A THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE HAVE AN IN USE WE JUST GOT TO CONNECT THE DOTS LIKE PUTTING THE INCENTIVES IN THE RIGHT PLACE. RATHER THAN HAVING ALL THE INCENTIVE AT THE BACK AND TO JUST GO TO THE CHEAPEST DISPOSAL WERE BURNED FOR EXPORT. THE URGENT AYE VOTE. JEFF SERIES ON HALF OF THE U. S. TIRE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN SUPPORT. WE'VE BEEN WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND HAD DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE PAST SEVERAL VERSIONS BUT TO APPRECIATE WORKING WITH CAO RECYCLE. JESSICA AND A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SUPPORT IT OF THEM I THINK ORIGINALLY WAS A LOT OF CONCERNS BECAUSE THIS PARASITE ALREADY HAD AN ENORMOUS SURPLUS AND THAT WAS ONE OF THINGS WE ASK FOR WAS LET'S SPEND DOWN. ALL THE MONEY BEFORE YOU ALLOWED CHARGING A ONE OF THE AGREED TO THAT. WE ALSO AGREE WITH WHAT THE MARK MURRAY JUST SAID WHICH IS PROBABLY THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE IS PUTTING THIS ON OUR ROADS WHICH IS WHY THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT CAO RECYCLED SEPASANG BUT AT LEAST FIFTY PERCENT HAS TO GO TO THE ROOTS. NOW WE HAVE S. B. ONE FUNDING HOPEFULLY WILL START BUILDING MORE ROADS IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM. SO YEAH WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THEM. THE BILL MAY OR MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT IT'S UNCERTAIN MOST IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE ENCOURAGE OUR SPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON CARE MARKETS AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES HERE IN SUPPORT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CRITICAL PARTNERS WITH THE STUDY I TO DENVER ARE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS OUT OF OUR LANDFILLS BUT REALLY ARE CRITICAL TO THIS PROCESS IS. MARKET INCENTIVES AND AND USES FOR THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS AND WE FEEL THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP PROVIDE SOME STABILITY AND LONG TERM FUNDING. AND THOSE INCENTIVES FOR THAT PROCESS THAT WE AREN'T SUPPORT THINK. MISTER CHAIRMAN IS JUST LOAN FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT AS A SAUCE BY WATER BOND CALIFORNIA TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT AS WELL FOR THE BILL THANK YOU.

PER TIRE ALLOCATION VERSUS A PER VEHICLE AT ALLOCATION A WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS MEASURE LAST YEAR WE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION WITH A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND TRY TO FIND A WAY TO FIX THAT. THAT PROPOSAL BEING A TWO THIRDS VOTE BILL WE DECIDED TO WAIT UNTIL TWENTY NINETEEN TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE FORWARD ON THAT BUT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL. THAT'S WHY WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY NEUTRAL THINKS EMERGING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. SEEING NONE. THOSE IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. AT PUB OUR ON BEHALF OF CRM. I. ONE DAY INTRODUCED MY CLIENT WILL BE MAKING SOME TESTIMONY IS VERY TALK LOU WITH C.

MY PERSONAL BACKGROUND HE'S RATHER MODIFIED ASPHALT ON THE REGISTER PROFESSIONALS OF AN ENGINEER. I FORTY SUPPORT. MISTER BERMAN SO. BILL HA EVER. AL WE HAVE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ISSUES VETO THE BILL HAS EATEN. AND. IT THIS TIME MY COMPANY A LONG WEEK. OVER NINETY FISH NOT THE TOY YOU SLACKERS OF A STILL CALIFORNIA OPPOSING THIS BILL FOR THREE MAIN REASONS. NUMBER ONE WE BELIEVE RATHER MODIFIED WHAT IS A GREAT. THE IN USE FOR RUBBER MOTHER OF FOUR RECYCLED RUBBER WE LIKE THE MONEY MOVES FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO DENOTE CHO GOVERNMENT. LIKE AB FIVE TWO TEAM IS BEING DOING. WE WERE BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE DID YOU CAN GET THE BEST RECYCLING AND THAT'S WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET MARKET PULLED FLOODED THE MARKET PUSH. THE THE SECOND ITEM JUST BILL WOULD. JESUS DISCOURAGE USE OPTED ROBERT HIM FEEL. IN AS IN PLAYFIELDS WE WE WERE THAT'S THAT'S OVER TWENTY FIRST OF ALL OF THE TALKS ARE BEING RECYCLED SO CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO THAT USE AND THAT'S A GREAT KEEPS. AND. FINALLY SITS ON MAKING A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. IN A STOCKTON. GENERATING THE OR FIRST FACE FIFTEEN YOU JOBS GOING UP TO HUNDRED SHOPS. BECAUSE IT'S WHY RECYCLER DE SPILLED HAS. HE'S IT GIVES SO MUCH ON ON CERTAINTY HAS IT BEEN BUSTING INTO RECYCLING JOBS AND BUSINESSES TO ENCOURAGE MORE INVESTMENT TIED RECYCLING. AND DEPENDENCY TO DECLINE TO DID TODAY INCENTIVES IT'S IS GOING TO A WRONG DIRECTION BICU HAVE STATED IN CHATTANOOGA. EATING WHAT'S A LOTS OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES SO WE DO NOT WANT RECYCLING P. ALWAYS DB CHANT DEPENDENT TO TODAY INCENTIVES SO. IRVINE FOR THESE THREE REASONS OF MY SOUL PAN OVER NINETY PERCENT OF THE TIRE RECYCLERS OFF CALIFORNIA PRODUCE POINT B. OPPOSING. APPEAL HOWEVER. I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH AUTHOR TO TO MAKE IT. PERFECT BILL. THIS IS MY WHOLE OF HIS STATE. THIS IS THIS IS ALL PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE. MY NAME IS BRIAN HIRSCH ON THE OWNER OF NATIONAL BLENNY COMPANY BASED ON LAFAYETTE. FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS HAVE BEEN A CONTRACTOR ASSOCIATE WITH RUBBERIZED ASPHALT BLENDING. UP ON A YEARLY BASIS WE'VE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH ENOUGH RUBBERIZED ASPHALT BLENDING YOU COULD PAVE ONE LANE OF I. FIVE ALL THE WAY FROM. A READING TO LOS ANGELES. IN THE FIFTEEN YEARS PRIOR TO THE CONTRACTING. A I WORK FOR LOCAL AGENCIES WHO ARE RECIPIENTS OF THE CAL RECYCLE GRANTS. UTILIZE RUBBERIZED. HOUSEHOLD RELATED PRODUCTS IN THEIR ROADWAYS FUEL FOR FIXING YOUR LOCAL STREETS. AND THE BILL DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT FUNDING FOR EMBRACE PAYMENT RELATED PRODUCTS. WOULD GO. TO THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES. AND WE SEE THE BILL IS HURTING OF THE PROGRESS THAT THE RUBBERIZED ASPHALT HAS MAIN CALIFORNIA WHICH. IS IS MADE GREAT STRIDES. ENCLOSING ARE JUST REQUESTING THAT THE MONEY FOR THE RUBBERIZED ASPHALT. ACTUALLY GO TO THE CITY AND COUNTIES. AND REAFFIRMED THAT WE'RE OPPOSED TO. THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IS COME FORWARD. STEVE KRAUSE ON BEHALF OF THE HOWEVER PAVEMENT ASSOCIATION.

EXISTENCE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND WE PROMOTE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY BUT ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA THE USE OF US ASPHALT RUBBER. NAM WE. OPPOSE THIS BILL PRIMARILY AS A PIPE PERSON JUST INDICATED BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL. THAT ALLOWS CAO RECYCLED THE ABILITY TO CSUS SHIFT. FUNDS FROM THE ELIGIBLE ENTITY THE ELIGIBLE ENTITY BEING POTENTIALLY I WOULD. SHOULD BE. PUBLIC COUNTIES. CITIES. AND AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT THAT IT. HAS ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE EXISTING GRANT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM COULD POTENTIALLY STRIP THOSE COUNTIES. IN CITIES OF THE RIGHT TO USE THOSE FUNDS SACRAMENTO COUNTY JUSTIN LAST. FOUR YEARS IS USED OVER ONE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS WORTH AND. THIRTY MILLION HAS GONE TO CALIFORNIA. LOCAL. CITIES AND COUNTIES FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND WE'D HATE TO SEE. THOSE CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT DESPERATELY NEED THIS MONEY. AND NOT TO HAVE NOT TO BE AN ELIGIBLE ENTITY IF THERE'S EVER CHANGE IN. ADMINISTRATION TO COVER CYCLE THAT HAS DIFFERENT IDEAS AND DIFFERENT THOUGHTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEGAN RPA OPPOSES THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE JUST STATE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL OF COURSE MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLFE THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. AND JUST AS WE WERE OPPOSED TO THE AFRASIAB AUSTER OPPOSED TO THIS ONE AS WELL THANK YOU. HI JACK MADONNA FROM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TIRE DEALERS ASSOCIATION THE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE COUNCILS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE. CALIFORNIA BUSINESS. ASSOCIATION OF PRIMARILY BY. WERE OPPOSED TO THE DOLLAR FEE WE THINK IT'S GOING TO HURT. THE. LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES OUT THERE BECAUSE IT'S THE A DOLLAR FEES ON TOP OF THE DOLLAR SEVENTY FIVE WHICH RESULTS IN. A NEW SET OF TIRES WILL COST THE ADDITIONAL ELEVEN DOLLARS IN FEES WE THINK THAT'S OF. WILL HURT THE LOW INCOME FOLKS AWARE OPPOSED TO THAT WERE ALSO WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THE. THE TIRE FUND HAS A PARKS ME SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AN AVERAGE LAST THREE YEARS SO THEY HAVE PLENTY OF MONEY WE FEEL LIKE THEY SHOULD SPEND THE MONEY RESPONSIBLY BEFORE THE ADD ANOTHER DOLLAR TO CONSUMERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CATHERINE BRANDENBURG REPRESENTING LIKE AND TIRES FOR THE LARGEST TIRE PROCESSOR IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS PREVIOUS SON SPEAKERS A STATE WHERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. IRAN FLANAGAN A BEHALF OF INSTITUTE SCRAP RECYCLING INDUSTRIES ARE IN OPPOSITION AS PREVIOUS SPEAKERS AND MENTION WHERE PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH THE ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT. DISCOURAGES THE AND USE WITH CRUMB RUBBER FOR INFILL FOR FIELD TURF. FOR PLAYGROUND MULCH ARM WOULD LIKE IT'S IN CONTINUE TO SEE THIS IS A VIABLE OPTION FOR AND USE RECYCLED TIRES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT WE'LL OPEN IT TO THE COMMITTEE I AM LIKE FIRST INVITE A MISTER BERMAN TO. RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED. SURE. MARK JOIN THINK FIRST CRACK YOUR. HE ANY ANY CONCERNS IN PARTICULAR WELL UM I KNOW THAT WHEN I MET WITH THE WITH THE PRESIDENT OF C. R. AND. HE RAISED THE POINT. WHICH. RACE TO. YELLOW FLAG AT LEAST HIM IN MY MIND ABOUT TO. YOU KNOW HOW THE STATE HOUSE CAL RECYCLING HAS BEEN. SITTING ON A SURPLUS AND AND WE WERE. PROPOSE YOUR BILL IS PROPOSING A NEW FEE. SPIKE THE SURPLUS EXISTING COULD YOU EXPLAIN SURE. AND AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE FIRST CRACK AND MARK CAN. GONNA FILL IN THE GAPS SO I I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT WE SHOULDN'T. APPLY AN ADDITIONAL FEE INTO A SURPLUS IS DRAWN DOWN AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES OF THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY STATES WHICH IS PART OF PRIOR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CURRENT OPPOSITION WHO WAS THEN A SUPPORTER. OF THE BILL AND AND OTHERS. THAT WE SHOULD FIRST DRIVE DOWN TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONCE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS LEVEL IS REACHED THEN CAL RECYCLE CAN START THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING WITH THE APPROPRIATE FEE IS. THAT TAKES ABOUT A YEAR TO DO BECAUSE IT'S A THOROUGH PUBLIC PROCESS AND IT'S IMPORTANT KNOW THAT IT'S UP TO A DOLLAR IT IS NOT A DOLLAR FEE. DURING THAT TIME THE HOPE IS THAT. THIS PROGRAM. WILL GENERATE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HEARING GRANTS AND SO WHILE WE'RE DETERMINING WHAT THE FEES SHOULD BE WILL BE SPENDING THE LAST TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THE IN THE FIND. AND THEN AS SOON AS THE FUND IS FULLY EXHAUSTED IT THAT IS WHEN THE NEW FEE WILL KICK IN. ADD TO HELP PROVIDE THE RESOURCES FOR THE CONTINUATION AND I SHOULD ADD STABILITY. OF THE PROGRAM SO THIS CREATES STABILITY AND DOES NOT CREATE INSTABILITY FOR THE PROGRAM SO. THIS IS IT YOU KNOW. I'M NEW TO THIS I THIS IS MY FIRST TIME AUTHOR YOU THE BILL THE BILL'S. COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND IN PASSED OUT TWICE BEFORE AND A LOT OF THE DETAILS HAVE BEEN HASHED OUT DURING THAT TIME. OF AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I THINK THAT WE HAVE A VERY SOLID BILL TODAY. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THERE'S MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M JUST WONDERING WITH RESPECT TO THE MATERIALS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THIS PROGRAM COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS THE CASE SIR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO FIRST OFF TIRE DERIVE FUELS A BURNING TIRES LANDFILL USES AN EXPORTING TIRES DON'T FURTHER THE RECYCLING GOALS. SO THAT'S WHY THOSE NOW USES ARE EXCLUDED THE DECISION TO EXCLUDE PLAYGROUND IN TURF PRODUCTS WITH THE COMPROMISE THAT WAS REACHED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. OR MY PREDECESSOR RICH GORDON WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AND WALTER OF ISN'T ELIGIBLE FOR THIS NEW INCENTIVE PROGRAM THE BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE OTHER EXISTING GRANT PROGRAMS OR CAL RECYCLES AUTHORITY. TO DISTRIBUTE GRANTS UNDER THOSE PROGRAMS THE THE BILL EVEN PROVIDES OF THE RECYCLING AND USES THAT ARE NOT COVERED MAY CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE GRANT PROGRAMS. A AND I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE SYNTHETIC TURF GRANTS HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. IN IN AND INTEREST HAS DECLINED DRAMATICALLY AYE IN THOSE TYPES OF GRANTS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE COUNTER CYCLE HAS AWARDED TWENTY FIVE GRANTS TOTAL FOR SYNTHETIC TURF FIELDS THERE WAS ONLY ONE GRANT AWARDED IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AND NO TURF FIELD REQUESTS. MORE SUBMITTED IN THE LAST GRANT CYCLE. THEN FINALLY IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS COMPROMISE APPROACH WAS IN BOTH TRUE AB TWELVE THIRTY NINE. BY SOME MEMBER GORDON IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND AB FIVE ON AYE BY SOME THE NUMBER FRAZIER AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THERE WAS NO OBJECTION WITH EITHER OF THIS BILL. MS EGGMAN. I THINK YOU THINK YOU INTO MISS MELINDA TO ASK THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK. AND I THINK YOU ENSURE QUITE EARLY SO THANK YOU. BUT AND I MET AT THAT LINK TO THE OPPOSITION IN IN MY DISTRICT AND AND. AND I THINK YOU'RE CORRECT IN AND AND SAYING. ON THAT YOU NEGOTIATED YOU TOOK WHAT WAS THERE AND AND AS I WENT OVER. DURING OUR MEETING YOU ASKED FOR EIGHT AMENDMENTS EIGHT AMENDMENTS WERE MADE AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR THREE ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS. AND I THINK SOME OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED WHILE WHERE. I'M SITTING HERE TODAY AND I ASSUME THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AS WE GO FORWARD. BUT AT BUT I THINK I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS WILL TAKE MONEY FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AWAY. I'M NOT SURE OF THE VERACITY OF THAT AS WE HAD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HERE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT AND SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A RURAL AREA I CAN TELL AND GREW UP UNDER RULE AREA AND HAD COUNTLESS. PILES OF TIRES DUMPED ON OUR PROPERTY AND ALL UP AND DOWN AND I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I GO TO MY FARM BUREAU MEETINGS US WHEN THE BIGGEST ISSUES PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT. IS TIRES DUMPED OUT AND THAT SOME HE'S GOTTA GO PICK HIM UP. AND FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THE THEM THAT MOVE THE BILL.

HOW WITH ME AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE NORTH BAY CONSERVATION CORPS AS WELL AS THE STATE? HI MY NAME'S MERRILY OCCURRED AND I'M THE CEO FROM CONSERVATION CORPS NORTH BAY. AND I'M ALSO REPRESENTING THE FOURTEEN CERTIFIED LOCAL CORES THAT OUR PART OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LOCAL CONSERVATION CORES. LOCAL COURSE RESPOND TO ALL KINDS OF EMERGENCIES WE RESPOND TO FIRE FLOOD EARTHQUAKES. I IN FACT OF MY CORE CONSERVATION CORPS NORTH BAY WAS STARTED THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO IN RESPONSE TO THE FLOODS OF NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. LAST OCTOBER DEVON'S A DEVASTATING FIRE STORMS HIT CINEMA AND NAPA COUNTIES. NOW THIS WOULDN'T. THIS ARE NORMALLY HANDLED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. BUT BECAUSE THIS WAS SO. LARGE. FIRST I WENT TO THE STATE AND THEN IT WENT TO THE FEDERAL ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. SO NORMALLY WE WOULD JUST BE BROUGHT IN BY THE LOCAL COUNTY AND WE'D BE INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS AND LOTS OF TIMES THE CC THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS IS ALSO BROUGHT IN. BUT IN THIS CASE THINGS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY THAT THAT WAS IN THE POSSIBILITY. SO. THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS DID COME IN IMMEDIATELY TO HELP. BEN BUT IF YOU REMEMBER THERE WERE FIRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THERE WERE. I MEAN SO MANY FIRES IN THE STATE AND THE CCC. DIDN'T HAVE. I ME NAME THEY REALLY THAN HAVE THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND ADEQUATELY TO ALL THE PLACES THAT NEEDED THEIR HELP. AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HAPPY TO BRING IN THE LOCAL COURSE TO HELP AND THAT'S. BUT WE DID NOT I HAVE A CONTRACTING MECHANISM. SO. THE BOOK LOCAL CHOIRS ARE QUALIFIED TO DO THIS WORK IN THIS CASE WE COULD'VE HELPED WITH. WITH CONTAINING THE HAZARDOUS WASTE THE ARMY CORPS WAS REMOVING IT BUT. YOU NO IT RAINS WERE PREDICTED AND THERE WAS THE FEAR THAT THE HAZARDOUS WASTE FROM THE BURNED HOUSES WOULD GO INTO THE OF. THE COUNTIES WATERSHED AND IT'S THE WATERSHED FOR ALL OF CINEMA COUNTY AND NORTHERN MARIN COUNTY. WE CAN ALSO DO EROSION CONTROL AND. AND ALSO. WHILE EROSION CONTROLS OF IT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL AND CONTAINING THE HAZARDOUS WASTE. BUT NOT ONLY THAT ARE CORPS MEMBERS OR UPS THAT. THERE THEY KEPT COMING TO ME AND THEY. WE'RE SAYING Y. THIS IS OUR COMMUNITY WHY CAN'T WE HOPE. AND. IT'S IT IT WAS HARD TO TELL TO EXPLAIN TO THEM WHY THEY WEREN'T BEING ABLE TO HELP IN THIS SITUATION. AND MANY OF OUR CORE MEMBERS COME FROM DISADVANTAGED SITUATIONS THEY HAD DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES IN THEIR LIVES. AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN NEGATIVE ACTIVITIES THEY COME TO US TO CHANGE OUR LIVES. MA'AM I CAN ASK YOU TO THREATEN YEAH NOTHING WOULD HELP CHANGE IT WOULD CREATE LIFELONG CHAINS LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE A HERO FOR YOUR COMMUNITY. SO I'M A. I'M ASKING YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR FUTURE EMERGENCIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. COME FORWARD. SEEING NONE ANY. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. MCCARTY. CELLS ARE GOOD BELL. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASSED APPROPRIATIONS JIKES CLOSE THANK YOU ASK YOUR I'VE BUILT. LOCAL PLACE. SO. WE. OKAY. SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ITEM THREE AB NINETEEN TWENTY A BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA LIKE ACOSTA AYE BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. FLORA. LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY MCCARTY AYE MELINDA'S. STONE. STONE I. ZERO SIX ZERO BILLS UP. NEXT WE HAVE A MISS FRIEDMAN WITH THE TWO BILLS ITEM TWENTY FOUR AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE. AND ITEM TWENTY SIX AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE REQUIRES THE SECRETARY OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO TAKE ACTION TO ADD ANY CALIFORNIA RIVER IN THE NATIONAL WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS SYSTEM. THAT IS REMOVED DELISTED OR WHOSE PROTECTIONS OR WEAKENED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS SYSTEM IF IT IS NOT ALREADY PART OF THAT STATE'S SYSTEM. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE DIRECTS THE SECRETARY TO ADD THAT THE RIVER OR RIVER SECTION TO THE STATE SYSTEM AFTER HOLDING A PUBLIC HEARING ABOUT THE FEDERAL ACTION. THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MILES OF FEDERALLY PROTECTED WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS IN CALIFORNIA BETTER PRESERVED IN THEIR FREE FLOWING CONDITION FOR THE BENEFIT AND ENJOYMENT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. BETTER NOT ALSO PROTECTED BY THE STATE SYSTEM. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE APPLIES TO THESE FEDERALLY PROTECTED RIVERS IF CONGRESS OR THE COURT ADMINISTRATION WERE TO PASS LEGISLATION OR ENACT ANY EXECUTIVE ORDER. TO ELIMINATE FEDERAL PROTECTION FROM ALL OUR PORTION OF A RIVER LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA. FEDERALLY PROTECTED LANDS THAT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES ARE CURRENTLY UNDER ATTACK LAST YEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCER REVIEW OF TWENTY SEVEN NATIONAL MONUMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO REDUCE THEIR SIZE OR ELIMINATE THE PROTECTED STATUS THE LIST INCLUDES THE KARIZ ó PLAIN NATIONAL MARIN MONUMENT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO AND CURRENT COUNTIES. INTERIOR SECRETARY ZINC HE RELEASED A REPORT IN DECEMBER INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO SHRINK BIG BEERS EARS AND GRAND STAIRCASE ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENTS IN UTAH. ALSO IN CALIFORNIA SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE HAS CONSIDERED AT LEAST THREE BILLS TO REMOVE PROTECTIONS FOR PART OF THE MERCED WILD RIVER. A FEDERALLY PROTECTED RIVER TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION OF A RESERVOIR. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE WOULD ENSURE THAT FEDERALLY PROTECTED REVERSING CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED BY CALIFORNIA LAW SHOULD THE LOOSER FEDERAL STATUS. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPONENTS UNPLANNED AB LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT AS A SECRETARY CONSIDER THE REASON WHY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REMOVED THE RIVER FROM THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. AND THAT THEY ARE AN ADDITION TO THE STATE SYSTEM WOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC BUT UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE SECRETARY. IN FACT THE IDEA FOR MY BILL CAME FROM SOME SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF MY THE LAST YEAR A. B. NINE SEVENTY FIVE. THAT WOULD HAVE MADE MINOR IMPROVEMENTS TO THE STATE WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS PROGRAM. I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE BILL DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY RIVERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING STUDIED FOR POSSIBLE INCLUSION IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. ONLY ONCE THE CURRENTLY ARE LISTED MY OFFICE IS MET WITH DIFFERENT COUNTY WATER AUTHORITY WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT IMPACT THE PROPOSED TEMPERANCE FLAT DAM. FRIEND DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB SPIN ADEN TO NINE SEVEN FIVE IS STEVE EVANS WITH FRIENDS OF THE RIVER I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME STEVE EVANS ON BEHALF I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE RIVER WHICH HAS BEEN WORKING TO PROTECT STREAMS RIVERS AND WATERSHEDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE. FRIENDS OF THE RIVER HAS PLAYED AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL DESIGNATION OF EVERY WILD AND SCENIC RIVER IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. THE FEDERAL AND STATE WILD AND SCENIC RIVER SYSTEMS ARE THE PRIMARY RIVER CONSERVATION TOOLS IN CALIFORNIA BOTH SYSTEMS PROTECT THE FREE FLOWING CHARACTER. AN EXTRAORDINARY OR OUTSTANDING VALUES OF ABOUT TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED MILES OF SELECTED RIVER AND STREAM SEGMENTS IN THE STATE. THAT'S ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF THE NINETY FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF RIVERS STREAMS IN THE STATE. THERE ARE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF RIVERS AND STREAMS OF CALIFORNIA THERE SOLELY PROTECTED THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. THIS INCLUDES SOME OF THE MOST WELL KNOWN WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS IN THE STATE. INCLUDING SEGMENTS OF THE TOILETTE ME IN MERCED RIVER'S FLOWING FROM YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK. THE KING'S RIVER FLOWING FROM SEQUOIA KINGS RIVER CANYON NATIONAL PARK. THE KERN RIVER IN THE SOUTHERN SIERRA AND EVEN RELATIVELY SMALL BUT STILL MAGNIFICENT SAYS WALK RIVER AND CSP CREEK IN THIS. CENTRAL COAST REGION. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE PROVIDES A STATE SAFETY NET FOR THESE EXISTING FEDERAL RIVERS HAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SIGNS IS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. OR CONGRESS PASSES LEGISLATION TO REMOVE FEDERAL PROTECTION FROM ALL OR PART OF ANY OF THESE RIVERS WERE WEAKENS THE PROVISION OF THE FEDERAL LAW THAT ENSURES. THAT THESE RIVER RIVERS REMAIN FREE FLOWING FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE DOES NOT INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF RIVERS AND STREAMS PROTECTED IN THE STATE. IT'S SIMPLY INSURES THAT THE STATE PROVIDE A SAFE HAVEN FOR EXISTING FEDERAL WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS. IN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO LEGISLATION PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE. PROVIDING A STATE SAFETY NET IF FEDERAL CLEAN AIR AND WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER SAFETY LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE TO BE WEAKENED. FAR SIGHTED LEGISLATORS PROTECTED OUR WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS FOR ALL CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIANS TO ENJOY. LET'S ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF THIS LEGACY BYPASSING AB TWENTY SEP TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE. FRIENDS OF THE RIVER IN MORE THAN FORTY OTHER CONSERVATION RECREATION AND NATIVE AMERICAN GROUPS. MERGER AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON KYLE JOHNSON CYNICAL CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY NINE SEVENTY FIVE IT'S PRACTICAL APPROACH TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE TO OUR RIVER SYSTEMS THEIR RADIC BEHAVIORS FROM DC. I'M YOUR DRIVER TODAY THANK YOU. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON ON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS RECALL MONSTERS NOT A WITH THE. TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND WILD AND SCENIC RIVERS ARE BIG PART OF OUR RECORD OUTDOOR RECREATION INDUSTRY IN THE STATE WHICH IS A NINETY BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. ON THIS IS SMART LEGISLATION REALLY APPRECIATE IT ANTI AND SUPPORT. HELLO SEVERE AFRICA OR THE PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S LEGACY OF LIVING RIVERS. HE COULD A KARATE WITH NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL IN STRONG SUPPORT. DANIELLE AND ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S TROUT IN SUPPORT. AND LISA PARA BEHALF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT. AND PAUL MASON WITH THE SUIT FOR US TRUST ALSO IN SUPPORT. ALEX BRING WITH FRESHWATER THIRTY WERE TWEENER BUT WE APPRECIATE. WORKING WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN STAFF ON THIS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT ANYWAY FOR THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. CHAIRMAN OTHER MEMBERS POLIO OR SHUTTER INTO HIM HAVE THE FRESNO COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE COMMENTS AT THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MADE. AND ARE OPEN ABOUT TEMPERANCE FLAT TEMPERANCE FLAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. AND TO THE ECONOMY. AND THE HEALTH. OF A MAJOR SWATH OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IT CANNOT BE OBSTRUCTED BY WHAT IS OTHERWISE A VERY WELL INTENTIONED BILL I'M SURE AND SO. I THINK THIS MAY BE A SITUATION WHERE BELT AND SUSPENDERS. ARE IN ORDER IN TERMS THE LANGUAGE DOWN THE ROAD AND WE JUST WILL WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR INNER STAFF ON THAT THANK YOU. CLIFF MOYAMOYA HERE FOR THE GLOCK A GROUP ON BEHALF OF KINGS RIVER CONSERVATION DISTRICT KINGS IN A RIVER. SKIRT OF THE. UNITED WATER CONSERVATION DISTRICT AND THE KINGS WERE WATER SOCIALIZATION APPRECIATE THE. OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET UP WITH AMENDMENTS TO LOOK AT NOT A DE FACTO LISTENING PROCESS WE WANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. THE LOCALS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A INTERACTION NOT ONLY WITH THE SECRETARY BUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT REDUCED A CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE CIRCUMVENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE BY HAVING IT JUST BE AN ACTION BY THE SECRETARY. OF THE CURRENT PROCESS DOES ALLOW FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THE STATUTORILY SO WORK. HAVE CONCERNS WITHOUT BUT APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS FOR THE AUTHOR TO THINK OF THE OTHER OPTIONS FOR LIST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN JASON OCCURRED WITH AT HOSTING GILBERT RESTAURANTS MAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION. ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH US AND TALK ABOUT OUR CONCERNS. WE HOPE AND IF THE BILL'S TO MOVE FORWARD WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. AND ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS TRICIA GERINGER WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENT OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND FARMERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE ALSO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STAFF AND. WE ARE OPPOSE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND ECHOING MR MY OMINOUS ASK COMMENTS EARLIER THINK YOU. MIKE MILLER THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF WHITE GRAPE GROWERS UP I THINK THE AUTHOR STAFF WORKING WITH US WE TOWARD WORKING WITH THEM BUT THE SNOW BUT WE ARE STILL OPPOSED. HARM HOPEFUL OF REACHING SOME RESOLUTION. BOTH. ALLEN THERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE STILL OPPOSE BUT. WE ALL LIKE TO BE HOPE NO ANY ANY FURTHER I WITNESSES. IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE DO NOT HAVE A MUCH. MOTIONS MADE AND SECONDED. SOMERS FRIEDMAN. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. HI. SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE YOU'RE. A ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT. RACES CONCERNS. AND SO. WE. S. THE. A NATURIST HORSES COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE KEPT IN THE LOOP IN TERMS OF YOUR ONGOING EFFORTS ON THIS BILL AND WEEZER WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO. FOR THE BILL A BILL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AFTER A. REVIEWING CHO. FURTHER AMENDMENTS BUTTA. AT THIS TIME THE. CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH LIKE CLUBS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST YEAR WITH THE OPPONENTS AND AS HE SAID WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER WE'RE PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH LANGUAGE THAT WILL ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. ALRIGHT. I BROKE UP IF I DON'T TRY FOR A BETWEEN ANTHONY FIVE BY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS OR EFFORT APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA NO ACOSTA NO BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. FLORA. FLORA NO LIMO. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. MELENDEZ. STONE. SO I. THREE TO NO FOUR TWO FOUR TWO THE BILL'S UNCLE. NEXT ITEM IS AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. THANK YOU CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I LIKED TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FIVE THE OF THE ANALYSIS AS AN AUTHORS AMENDMENT. A. B. THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM BUILDINGS IN LINE WITH OUR STATES CLIMATE GOALS. UNLIKE ELECTRICITY GENERATION THERE ARE NO COMPREHENSIVE STATE GOALS AIMED AT REDUCING THE CARBON EMISSIONS FROM THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS IN NEW ARE FROM THE MORE THAN THIRTEEN MILLION EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUEL USE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S BUILDINGS ARE ON PAR WITH EMISSIONS FROM ALL IN STATE POWER PLANTS. MANY ESTIMATES SHOW THAT. OUR BUILDINGS ADMIT ARE PROBABLY THE THIRD LARGEST I'M EMITTER OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS OUR LOOK ELECTRICS ELECTRICITY SUPPLY GETS CLEANER THESE DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND BUILDINGS WILL BECOME ONE OF THE TOP BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. SPECIFICALLY A. B. THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO REQUIRES THE CDC TO DEVELOP A PLAN BY TWENTY TWENTY ON HOW TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF NEW BUILDINGS BEING ZERO MISSION BUILDINGS BY TWENTY THIRTY. DEVELOPED A SECOND PLAN ON HOW WE CAN GET A FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE EMISSIONS OF GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE SEATS EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. REPORTING FUTURE INTEGRATED ENERGY POLICY REPORT SOME PROGRESS TOWARDS BOTH SCHOOLS ABOVE AND OPEN A PROCEEDING ON ELECTRICAL LOAD MANAGEMENT TO OPTIMIZE BUILDING USE AND DECREASE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I REALIZE THAT SOME PEOPLE OF CONCERNED WITH A. B. THIRTY TWO THIRTY TWO AND SEE THIS IS A MANDATE FOR ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ELECTRIFICATION OF BUILDINGS FOR TWENTY THIRTY. THAT IS NOT OUR INTENT. I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE OPPONENTS ON LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES THE CONSIDERATION OF MULTIPLE OPTIONS SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY ELECTRICITY IN RENEWABLE GAS STORAGE AND IS SOLELY FOCUSED ON THE LEAST COST STRATEGIES TO DE CARBONIZATION. I'M ALSO WILLING TO REQUIRE THE STUDIES OF THE GOALS TO CONSIDER THE IMPACTS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING PYRITES INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS IN AGRICULTURE. FURTHERMORE LANGUAGE WILL BE ADDED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE CDC WOULD NOT BE SETTING RATES FOR ANY POWER PROVIDER. WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO IS PURE TO FORGE WITH AN RTC CHARLIE CONWAY FROM EFFICIENCY FIRST CALIFORNIA AND DOCTOR ROBERT GOULD FROM PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. THAT SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA CHAPTER RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. JOHN MEMBERS MY NAME IS GERALD FORD WITH THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. AND ALL THE SEASON STRONG SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. THE BILLING SECTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE EMISSIONS AND SPACE HEATING AND WATER HEATING OF THE TOP TWO EMISSIONS SOURCES IN MOST BUILDINGS. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE HAVE A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGY IN EXISTENCE TODAY. THAT CAN CUT THOSE HEATING EMISSIONS BY HALF OR MORE. HOWEVER THE LACK OF POLICY GOALS HAS LIMITED THE MARKET DEVELOPMENT OF KEEN HEATING SOLUTIONS MANY BUILDERS AND CONTRACTORS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM. DISTRIBUTORS OFTENTIMES TALK THEM. SETTING LONG TERM GOALS IS KEY TO DRIVE THE NECESSARY POLICY PLANNING THAT'S NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE IS THAT THESE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. WHEN YOU CONSIDER EVERYTHING THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND WOULD BENEFIT THE BUILDING SECTOR FROM EFFICIENCY CAN ELECTRICITY STORY FOR NOBLE GAS. FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION BY TWENTY THIRTIES VERY REASONABLE THE MEN GAP IS THE EMISSIONS FROM SPACE HEATING AND WATER HEATING. GOAL SETTING HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FOR CUNANAN JIM CALIFORNIA WHEN THE STATE SET IT'S FIFTY PERCENT RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY GOAL IS SEEMED AMBITIOUS. BUT JUST A FEW YEARS LATER WE ON TRACK TO ACHIEVING IT TEN YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. SO INDUSTRY NOW PROVIDES MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND JOB IN CALIFORNIA SO THE COSTS HAVE COME DOWN DRAMATICALLY THIS IS EXACTLY THE OPTIONS YOU WHEN YOU CHEN LOCK FOR CLEAN HEATING AND BUILDINGS. LET ME ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR POSITIONS ARGUMENTS. FIRST OF THIS IN THE NEXT RESTRICT EQUIVOCATION MANDATE. THIS IS NOT SUPPORTED BY FACTS AND BY THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL NOTHING IN THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO FAVORS ELECTRIFICATION. THE BILL'S TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AND PERFORMANCE BASED RENEWABLE GAS CAN COMPETE WITH ELECTRIFICATION ON ITS MERITS THE BILL DOESN'T PICK A WINNER IN FACT WE WILL NEED AND ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY. ANOTHER CLAIM IS THAT THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE QUICK CUSTOMER CHOICE THIS IS IRONIC. CUSTOMERS DON'T COME WE HAVE A REAL CHOICE WILL CLEANER AND MORE AFFORDABLE HEATING OPTIONS. GAS IS USING EIGHTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA BUILDINGS IT'S A DE FACTO MONOPOLY SITUATION. AND THE MARKET FOR KEY NO TURN DAVIS IS UNDER DEVELOPED. THIS BILL WOULD SPUR INVESTMENT INNOVATION AND MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. LAST WE HEAR CLAIMS THAT CLEAN ELECTRIC HEATING WOULD INCREASED CUSTOMER BILLS. BIG DATA OUTDATED PERCEPTION THAT ELECTRIC HEATING IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GAS HEATING. BUT THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE THIS WHAT THE CASE ONE VICTORY RESISTANCE HEATING WAS USED NOW WITH MODERN ELECTRIC HEATING BASE AND HE PUMP TECHNOLOGY. WHICH IS FIVE TO SIX TIMES AS EFFICIENT AT BEST COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGIES. ELECTRIC HEATING IS ACTUALLY AN OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE CUSTOM BILLS THAT IS CURRENTLY ONLY ACCEPTABLE TO WESTERN CALIFORNIANS AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. ENCOURAGING TO WRAP. AB THIRTY FIFTH THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO WOULD CUT CALIFORNIA WOULD PUT CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO CLEANER HEALTHIER AND MORE AFFORDABLE BUILDINGS. WE HONESTLY I FELT VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M A DOCTOR ROBERT GOULD AND I'M UP HERE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSEMBLY CISCO BAY AREA CHAPTER. OF PHYSICIANS FOR SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF WHICH I'M A PRESIDENT. AND ALSO ON OUR NATIONAL BOARD AND IN THIS CAPACITY I'M REPRESENTING THOUSANDS OF PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. SUPPORTING MEASURES SUCH AS A. B. THIRTY TWO THIRTY TWO AIMED AT ACHIEVING MAJOR REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR GLOBAL WARMING RELATED AIR POLLUTION. AND THE MANIFOLD OF ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTINUED USE OF SUCH ENERGY SOURCES. WE KNOW THAT THE BUILDING SECTOR CONTRIBUTES ABOUT A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE EMISSIONS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE VOTING A CONCRETE PLAN TO THE CARBON EYES ARE BUILDING SECTORS AS ENVISIONED BY A. B. THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. IS VERY SOUND PUBLIC POLICY AND THROUGH SUCH A PLAN WE COULD ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EMISSIONS OF NATURAL GAS THAT CONTRIBUTES BOTH INDOOR AND OUTDOOR POLLUTION. WHICH I HAVE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH IMPACT PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR MOST CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES RECOGNIZING THAT MODERN ELECTROCUTING COULD POTENTIALLY CUT CO TWO EMISSIONS AND HALF COMPARE WITH THE BEST GAS COMBUSTION. HEATING SYSTEMS AND IT EMISSIONS CAN DROP EVEN FURTHER AS OUR GRID CONTINUE SICK. GET CLEANER WE BELIEVE THAT A CONCERTED EFFORT TO LECTURE FIRE BUILDING SECTOR CAN PROVIDE ENORMOUS BENEFITS TOWARDS MITIGATING THE UNFOLDING IMPACTS OF GLOBAL WARMING. IN THIS CONTEXT I BELIEVE THAT BILL THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION IN. CALIFORNIA AS IT AIMS TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS FROM FOSSIL FUELS. WE BOTH BELIEVE THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION ON BEHALF OF THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO BROUGH SOME OF THE MOST POLLUTD AIR IN THE NATION WERE INCREASINGLY IMPACTED BY WILDFIRES AND OTHER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS? I STRONGLY URGE YOU ALL AYE VOTE IN AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DENISE DEVILLE I AM WITH E. HDD ARCHITECTS. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING AN INFORMAL GROUP OF ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BUILT ENVIRONMENT. WHO ARE ALREADY DOING THIS AND WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT? THIS THIS BILL TODAY. WHERE A GROUP OF ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE'RE DOING THAT BY ELIMINATING EMISSIONS AND BUILDINGS? OUR BUILDINGS USE. EMIT THE MOST THROUGH HEATING UP THE SPACE AND WATER. ARE FIRM IN PARTICULAR HAS BUILT IN DESIGN DOZENS OF ZERO EMISSION BUILDINGS AND THEY WORK BEAUTIFULLY AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE PAST HALF A DOZEN YEARS OR SO. IS GREAT IN THAT ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO DO THESE BUILDINGS NOW IF YOU START OUT WITH THAT DESIGN IN MIND AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AND A COMMITMENT TO REACH ZERO EMISSIONS. WE'VE DONE THIS FOR SCHOOL CAMPUSES OFFICE BUILDINGS AND A BIG FAN FAVORITE AT THE EXPLORATORIUM MIND PURE FIFTEEN. SO WE KNOW IT CAN BE DONE. OUR EMPHASIS IS IS REALLY IN HELPING THIS INDUSTRY REALLY GET BETTER AT IT WHAT WE SEEN AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN COMPONENTS IN EQUIPMENT. IS THAT YOU CAN BUY OFF THE SHELF NOW MANUFACTURERS ARE COMING A LONG WAY AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM. SO THEY'RE A CHEETAH AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. WITH THIS WE'VE ALSO SEEN. AND WE KNOW FROM OUR GENERAL CONTRACTORS THAT IT'S NO LONGER MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO THIS. MANY TIMES. WE'VE HEARD THAT IT IS THERE'S A PREMIUM TO PAY BUT WERE ACTUALLY SEEING IN FACT ON ONE OF OUR UC SAN DIEGO PROJECTS THERE'S GONNA BE AT ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR SAVINGS. BY GOING THIS ROUTE BECAUSE IT IS SO SENSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE RIGHT NOW. SO. FOR THAT. I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THING RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO NAME. AFFILIATION AND YOUR POSITION. I MY NAME IS CHARLES CORPS MANY I REPRESENT AND OF. THEN EFFICIENCY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M A EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HIS SINCE THE FIRST. WHICH IS A TRADE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING CONTRACTORS IN THE STATE. OF KEEP IT BRIEF I WANNA SAY THAT WERE IN FAVOR THIS BILL. AND THAT THE GOALS OF ENERGY REDUCTIONS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS GOALS IN THIS BILL THIS BILL ARE ACHIEVABLE. ACT BE DONE AT LOWER NO COST COMPARED TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WILL BEAR WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA FOR ALL THE REASONS SPOKEN BY DR. GOULD'S AB ONE STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. KYLE JONES IS HERE OF CALIFORNIANS TRANSPORT THANK YOU. TIFFANY FAN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. ERICA MARTINEZ SOME HALF OF EARTH JUSTICE IN STRONG SUPPORT. TINA GALLIERA WITH POSSIBLE FREE CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. JUDY POPE THREE FIFTY BAY AREA STRONG SUPPORT. NOT SINCLAIR UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA OFFICE THE PRESIDENT WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT IT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY INITIATIVE. GOAL FOR ALL UC CAMPUSES TO BE CARBON NEUTRAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SINGING NUN WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN RIGHT TUCCI AND MEMBERS NEED QUIRK COALITION FOR AN OVER AFRICA ASSN ACTUALLY HERE AS THAT WIENER. AYE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS ON. HER INTENT TO INCLUDE RENEWABLE GAS IN THE BILL AYE BUT I'D PROBABLY BE DOING MY MEMBERS AT THIS SERVICE BY NOT COMMENTING ON THE BILL AND PRINT. OUT WE AGREE WITH AND APPRECIATE THE INTENT LANGUAGE MAYBE THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO. UP PAGE THREE LINE SEVENTEEN THAT THE CARBON ISING CALIFORNIA'S BUILDINGS IS ESSENTIAL SERIES RICK TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. AT THE LOWEST POSSIBLE COST HOWEVER THE POLICY IN THIS BILL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THAT AND HAVE LANGUAGE DOES EXACTLY THE. OPPOSITE UP TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT CARBS TWENTY SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN IDENTIFIES THREE POTENTIAL PATHWAYS TO BUILDING DE CARBONIZATION. THOSE THREE PATHWAYS ARE RENEWABLE GAS SOLAR THERMAL AND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE THREE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CARD CAUTIONS. THAT COULD ACTUALLY CAUSE AN INCREASE IN EMISSIONS IS ELECTRIFICATION. FURTHERMORE THIS STRATEGY HAS A HIGH PURCHASE COST WITH HIGH INSTALLATION COSTS HIGHER LONG TERM OPERATING COSTS AND ALSO CREATES MASSIVE NEW ELECTRICAL DEMAND. THE FORTHCOMING STUDY THAT WILL BE CIRCULATED YOUR OFFICES FINDS THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO ELECTRIFY THE BUILDING SECTOR IN ORDER TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND THAT REPLACING A MERE SIXTEEN PERCENT OF GAS SUPPLY WITH RENEWABLE GAS FROM WAY STRINGS BY TWENTY THIRTY WOULD ACHIEVE THE SAME OUTCOME AT LESS COST THAN ELECTRIFYING THE ENTIRE BUILDING SECTOR IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE SAME TIME THIS WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE STATE'S FOR LIVE CLIMATE PRUDENT PLAN WHICH IS A CRITICAL NEW PART OF THE STATE'S CLIMATE STRATEGY. THE PLAN REQUIRES US TO CAPTURE FORTY PERCENT OF METHANE FROM CALIFORNIA'S WASTE STREAMS FROM SEWAGE TREATMENT LANDFILLS AND AREAS. THE CAPTURE OF THESE POLLUTANTS REPRESENT THIRTY PERCENT OF ALL THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS REQUIRED IN THE SCOPING PLAN TO REACH OUR TWENTY THIRTY GOALS. SO AGAIN I WOULD ENCOURAGE THIS COMMITTEE AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON YOUR BUILDING HE CARBONIZATION POLICY TO REALLY CONSIDER THE OPTION OF USING OUR NOBLE GAS. AND WHETHER ELECTRIFICATION IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT STRATEGY AT A MINIMUM MOVING FORWARD WE ASK THAT THIS BILL BE AMENDED TO ENSURE. THAT THE MANDATE WILL NOT UNINTENTIONALLY INCREASED LIFECYCLE EMISSIONS AND ALSO CONSIDER THE OPTION DE CARBONIZATION THROUGH THE USE OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AS A CO EQUAL STRATEGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YES MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ON BOB BREMER SENIOR ENGINEER WITH THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE SEAT YOU SEE IN THE P. YOU SEE ESTABLISH A POLICY GOAL OF HAVING ALL NEW RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ZERO NET ENERGY BY TWENTY TWENTY AND ON THE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ANY BY TWENTY THIRTY. IN JUST TEN YEARS AGO IN THIS PROCESS AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TO WOULDSIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THIS POLICY. AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO WOULD GIVE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION JUST TWELVE MONTHS TO DEVELOP A PLAN THAT WOULD REQUIRE ALL NEW RESIDENTIAL AND NON RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS. TO BE ZERO EMISSION BUILDING STARTING JANUARY TWENTY THIRTY THE CDC WOULD ALSO BE GIVEN TWELVE MONTHS TO ESTABLISH A POLICY INTRODUCED BY FIFTY PERCENT THE GHG EMISSIONS. FROM THE EXISTING RESIDENTIAL AND NON RESIDENTIAL BUILDING STOCK. REGARDING THE CDC'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES A CC TO ADOPT WHATEVER POLICY CHANGES ARE NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE ALL THESE GOALS BY TWENTY THIRTY. THIS BILL WAS EFFECTIVELY DIRECTING THE C. TEASED IS SUBSTANTIALLY DREW'S OR PERHAPS ELIMINATE NATURAL GAS USE IN NEW CONSTRUCTION AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED NATURAL GAS USE. IN VAST EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. THE FACT IS THE CDC IS ALREADY TAKING MAJOR STEPS TO ACHIEVE THE EXISTING Z. ANY POLICY GOAL. THE CDC IS ALREADY ADOPTED HUGE INCREASES IN STRINGENCY THEIR ENERGY RAGS WHICH TOOK EFFECT IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALL THREE OF THESE WERE HISTORICALLY LARGE INCREASES IN STRINGENCY. WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS THE CDC WILL BE ADOPTING THE NATION'S FIRST STATEWIDE MANDATE FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR ON ALL NEW HOMES AND APARTMENTS. THIS QUANTUM LEAP IN BUILDING STANDARDS WILL TAKE EFFECT IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY. THE CDC IS DONE ALL THIS IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER IN HIS GAIN THE SUPPORT OF BOTH INDUSTRY AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. BUT THIS QUANTUM LEAP AND BILLING STANDARDS NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY YOUR CONCERN STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY WEEKS WE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SEE AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY GOING OUT INTO THE GRID DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. PRECISELY WHEN THE GRID DOES NOT NEED IT OR CAN STORE IT TURNS OUT THE GRID IS A VERY POOR BATTERY. AT THE SAME TIME ALL THIS IS HAPPENING CALIFORNIA WILL SEE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. MOST ASKING TO WRAP OF SIR. WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS THE CDC TO BASICALLY LOOK INTO THE GRID RELIABILITY ISSUES AND THE GREAT PROTECTIVE ISSUES ARE THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE? A WE'RE ADDING THIS ON TOP OF THE HUGE INFLUX OF SOLAR ENERGY AND EVEY CHARGING. IN IN SIMPLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T BREAK THE GRIP. AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS FIND OUT IF ALL THESE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED BEFORE WE ESTABLISH IN THE STATE STATUTE THIS POLICY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR SHARE MEMBERS DAWN KEPT KEY MCCUE KEPT UNISYS IT'S A MAP THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. I CMT'S CONCERNS JUST TO BE VERY BRIEF FOREVER LATER TO AND THE FACT THAT SOME INDUSTRIAL REPAIRS DO NOT HAVE AN ELECTRIC EQUIVALENT TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE. THAT ENABLES THEM TO MEET BUSINESS NEEDS A CUSTOMER'S DEMANDS AND IT IS UNCLEAR FROM THIS BILL LANGUAGE HOW BROAD THE APPLICATION WOULD BE. OF FURTHER OUR CONCERN THAT CALIFORNIAN DUST RA RATEPAYERS ALREADY PAY A HEAVY PREMIUM OF ABOUT NINETY FIVE PERCENT ABOVE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SO THE CONCERN BEING THAT INCREASING COST PRESSURES WILL ADD TO THAT BURDEN AND MAKE OUR STATE LESS COMPETITIVE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES FROM MANUFACTURING STANDPOINT. A SO FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK. GOOD AFTERNOON UNLESS I'M ON BEHALF THE WESTERN PROPANE GAS ASSOCIATION ALSO AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION WPGA SUPPORTS CALIFORNIA AND ITS EFFORTS TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS INCLUDING FROM THE BUILDING SECTOR. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT ESTABLISHING PRESCRIPTIVE MEASURES THAT ELIMINATE CUSTOMER CHOICE CREATE TECHNOLOGY MANDATES AND INCREASE OUR CUSTOMERS OUT OF LIVING AND. COST OF LIVING AND COST OF DOING BUSINESS ARE SHORT SIGHTED AND UNNECESSARY. BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION MUST BE CONSIDERED ALONG WITH OTHER POTENTIAL GHG REDUCTION ALTERNATIVES TO ENSURE THAT THE AGGRESSIVE STATE CLIMATE GOALS ARE ACHIEVED. BY INSTITUTING A SINGLE ENERGY SOURCE MANDATE FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE GHG BENEFITS OFFERED BY PROPANE. TODAY'S PROPANE IS ONE OF THE BEST JUDGES FOR CALIFORNIA TO ACHIEVE ITS SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTION GOALS AND YET SHE KNOCKS AND SOCKS REDUCTION GOALS. PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE. FURTHER JUST AS ELECTRICITY IS EXPECTED TO BE A CLEANER SOURCE IN THE FUTURE IT SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD THE PROPANE THROUGH CONTINUAL TECHNOLOGY INFILL PRODUCTION ADVANCEMENTS. WILL CONTINUE ITS TRAJECTORY IN PROVIDING COMPETITIVE CLEAN ENERGY SOLUTIONS FOR DECADES TO COME. FURTHER WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE ENERGY COST TO CUSTOMERS PROPANE PROVIDES ENERGY USED FOR HOME HEATING AND COOKING TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS. WPGA IS PARTICULARLY PROUD OF OUR HISTORY AND SERVING LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS A ONE ENERGY SOURCE SOLUTION WOULD INTRODUCE AN UNDUE FINANCIAL BURDEN TO THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION. FOR GHG TARGET ENERGY SOLUTION DIVERSITY ALONG WITH THE OTHER REASONS STATED. BY OUR FELLOW UP FELLOW STAKEHOLDERS NOT POSITION WE MUST OPPOSE AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY TWO AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS. TO NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION GOOD AFTERNOON TIM CARMICHAEL REPRESENTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY AND SENATOR GAS ELECTRIC. IN OPPOSITION WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CHO OPENING COMMENTS. REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN PRINT THANK YOU. PATRICK WELL TO THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WE HAVE NO OFFICIAL POSITION BUT ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR RESOLVING AN INITIAL CONCERN ABOUT. AND. DUPLICATIVE GHG. ACCOUNTING THAT WERE IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION THE BILL WE DO HAVE SOME INITIAL CONCERNS ABOUT. THE NEW LANGUAGE IN THE BILL ABOUT CC OVER CYPRUS HIT THE COMMENTS TODAY WE LOOK FOR TO WORK WITH AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD. AT A RALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE O. WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. TO THE USE OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. SEAN LUIS WITH THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE ALSO OPPOSED. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M ON THE FLOOR IT'S WITH THE VALLEY INCHING CONGRESO FEES AND WE RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE THIS BILL ALTHOUGH WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND MITIGATING COST TO CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS THANK YOU. MATTHEW HELLO THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE VALERIE TRAIL OF LAJOS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY. TESTIFYING TODAY AS A TWEENER WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL POSITION BUT I JUST TO LET YOU KNOW WE'VE BEGIN A DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR TO EXPRESSSOME OF THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION HAS EXPRESSED TODAY THANK YOU. DAVE SHRIVER AMERICAN PUBLIC GAS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. HI MY NAME'S ALEX DOWN WITH MASS ENERGY WORKS FOR THE. LARGEST DEVELOPER OF. DAIRY DIGEST VERSION THE STATEMENT LIKE TO STAND OPPOSITION THANK YOU. WHICH CHAIRMAN A MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON P. ANTHONY THOMAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. AND TAKE EXCEPTION WITH THE COMMENT ABOUT CNETRIC AS BEING A DEFECTIVE MORE. MONOPOLY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ALRIGHT. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS EGGMAN THEM AS MELENDEZ. I THINK YOU. AND WE JUST MET BRIEFLY. THIS MORNING AND I EXPRESSED. SOME CONCERNS SO THE. HOUSING RESIDENTIAL AND AND NON RESIDENTIAL STE COMPRISE NINE PERCENT. OF THE JG AS A. DIRECTOR MISSIONS NINE PERCENT. FROM. IN. AND HAVE BEEN BETTER WHAT IS WHAT IS THE WHAT IS THE MANDATE RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO REDUCE IT TO. RIGHT NOW. ITEM OF THE THAT THERE IS A MANDATE WAS NO MANDATE NO MEANT NOTHING TO THIS WOULD BE THAT THIS TO BE THE FIRST WELL THINGS TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT A MANDATE THIS IS THE PLAN. THIS IS WHAT PEOPLE. WILL BE DEVELOPING PLANS CORRECT SO THAT OVER TIME WE COULD MEET THOSE GOALS CORRECT BUT AS I READ THERE'S. IT'S IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ALSO PLAN IMPLEMENTATION BECAUSE AS PLAN AND THEN DIRECTION BASED ON PLAN CORRECT. WELL I MEAN ULTIMATELY THEY WOULD IMPLEMENT THE PLANS. BUT WE'RE NOT IMPLEMENTING ANY PLANS IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. PROVIDES A STANDARDS OPTED FOR ELECT WILL LOAD MANAGEMENT FREEZE UTILITY AND TO ENSURE SO I THOUGHT I'D SAY THEY WOULD LIKE WE WILL. YEAH EVENTUALLY LIKE YOU WELL OKAY WHAT BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ALL PART OF THE SAME BILL. WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T SAY WHAT THE PLAN IS NO I JUST HAS WHATEVER PLAN THAT YOU COME UP WITH WILL BE IMPLEMENTED. RIGHT A PLAN WILL EVENTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED OKAY. BASED BASED ON THIS RIGHT TO DISEASE NOT ACTIVITIES DOESN'T COME BACK TO US AGAIN. MY QUESTION. RIGHT OKAY RIGHT WE JUST FELT LIKE THEY DEVELOP THE PLAN AND THEN THE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT COMING BACK TO THE BODY. THAT'S CORRECT ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE THINK. ON. SO CAN I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. AND. AND I'M ALSO SOMEBODY WHO HAS. A PIECE OF PROPERTY THAT USE PROPANE BUT WE ARE WAY OFF THE GRID WE HAVE SOLAR THAT WORKS WHEN IT'S AND CHENEY AND AT THE TIME SO IT DOESN'T. A AND AND WE USE PROPANE FOR FOR HEATING AND COOKING. AND SO THAT IS A CONCERN THAT. ANOTHER CONCERN JUST AS I AM AND WHY I HAVE MULTIPLE CONCERNED BUT THAT ANOTHER ONE IS. IN THE CITY OF STOCKTON WHERE WE'VE TALKED A LOT IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. AND WE HAVE A BEGIN BUILDING HOUSING STOCK CONSTRUCTING IT AGAIN RIGHT SO WHILE. AND WE THERE WE THERE'S A PENCIL OUT AT THIS TIME AND SO WHEN WE CONTINUE TO ADD MORE ONEROUS AND. STANDARDS MAKES ME VERY NERVOUS THAT IT WILL TAKE HOUSING TYPE OF REPEATING WOULD BE YES AGAIN THIS IS NOT A BILL ABOUT PURE ELECTRIFICATION. WE FULLY EXPECT THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WILL BE RESPECTED IN THESE PLANS AND WE UNDERSTAND IT THEY'RE IMPORTANT PART OF COMBATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND GREAT MANAGEMENT WAS ALSO BROUGHT UP AND THAT'S SPECIFICALLY ALSO CALLED OUT A IN THE BILL THAT WE WILL. I'M INSTRUCTED GRID MANAGEMENT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PARTOF IT'S EMISSIONS IT DOESN'T INCLUDE EMISSIONS FROM THE ELECTRICITY USE FOR HEATING WHICH IS ALSO. PART OF THE MIX IN CALIFORNIA SO THE TOTAL EMISSIONS FROM. JUST HEATING HOT WATER AND SPACE ARE AT LEAST A FIFTEEN PERCENT OFF A HIGHER. AND FOLLOW THE STATE NATURAL GAS IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER TO BUILD A SINGLE FUEL HOME THAT A DOUBLE KNIT YOU'LL SHOW HOME YOU SAVE MONEY AND APPLIANCES YOU SAVE MONEY OF PLUMBING UP CONNECTION COST. DOESN'T MEAN THAT HAS TO BE THAT WAY BUT UNLOCKING THE SIZE OF ONE OPTION IS ACTUALLY GONNA HELP MAKE BUILDING NEW BUILDINGS MORE AFFORDABLE. AND THE LAST POINT I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON SOME GREATER RELIABILITY WE APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE BE AYE A ON CREDIBILITY FAIRLY MINOR. AND NEW LOAD COMPARED TO ATTRITIONAL VEHICLES AND AND SORA SO IT'S NOT YOU KNOW I WE DON'T THINK THERE'S AND MAJOR ISSUE HERE THINGS SORTED BEEN LOOKED AT AND THE AGENCIES WOULD HAVE PROCESSES. LIKE OF THE FIFTY% THREE WHICH WOULD. I CHALLENGE ANYBODY TO SHOW ME A CURRENT ELECTRIC STOVE WITH FULL ELECTRIC COMPONENTS THAT IS GOING TO LAST ME THAT LONG. THE WASTE THAT WE GENERATE FROM NEW TECHNOLOGY CONTINUE TO COME MAN AND THAT WE GET A NEW ONE WOULD MAKE NEW MANDATES. IS GOING TO OVERWHELM THIS PLANET POTENTIALLY FASTER THAN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WORK ON. AGREED FOCUSED ON PROVIDING AFFORDABLE NATURAL GAS RELIABLY TO THEIR SCHOOLS HOSPITALS BUSINESSES. NATURAL GAS CALIFORNIA IS DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS ON A FULL FUEL CYCLE BASIS WITH THREE TIMES THE EFFICIENCY OF ELECTRICITY AND ONE THIRD THE COST. THE AVERAGE ALL ELECTRIC HOME BECAUSE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR MORE THAN AT HOME WITH NATURAL GAS APPLIANCES IN IT. SO OUR MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A MOVE FOR ELECTRIFICATION A KNOW. IT BECOMES AT THIS IS AND THAT IT THAT ONE WITNESS SAID IT WAS. MOVED WAS ELECTRIFICATION AND IMPACT IS GOING TO HAVE A LOW INCOME CONSUMERS. THAT'S SO THAT CLEARS IT UP. SO I. I WERE I RESPECT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY BECAUSE PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND HOW HIGH THEY ARE NOW AND IN FACT I THINK THEY'RE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE COMMENTS MADE BY. THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM STOCKTON WITH A PREFERENCE TO. ON WHAT TYPE OF THE PLANTS ONE WOULD COOK ON IN THEIR HOME AND HAVING THAT OPTION BEING TAKEN AWAY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT EVERY OTHER DAY OF SOLAR COMPANY IS CALLING MY HOME TELLING ME ABOUT THE GREAT DEALS THAT ARE GOING ON THERE STATE SANCTIONED IN CALIFORNIA. THE THE. FURTHER PROLIFERATION OF SOLAR USE IN CALIFORNIA IT IS. MORE WIDESPREAD CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN OTHER STATES. BUT I JUST SEE THE COST RISING MORE AND MORE FOR HOMEOWNERS OR POTENTIAL HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WERE ALREADY HAD A CRISIS. CRISIS POINT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND WHAT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS. WE ARE THERE. I I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOUR BILL WOULD. BE THEY THE SOLE REASON WHY THE WHOLE HOUSE COMES FALLING DOWN PARDON THE PUN. BUT I AM SUGGESTING THAT THIS CERTAINLY ISN'T GOING TO HELP THAT WHEN WE CONTINUE TO PUT MANDATES ON THAT HOMEBUILDING INDUSTRY. AND. WE CONTINUE TO. BECAUSE THE COST TO RISE FEWER AND FEWER PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME IN CALIFORNIA. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT I DON'T THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING THEY DO AND I THINK THAT'S THE WAY WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM WENT WITH RESPECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS IN THE AND THE AND THE HOUSING ISSUE THE AVERAGE HOME PRICES IN THE BAY AREA'S IT UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHO CAN AFFORD THAT? THAT PRICE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO UP. SO I I WOULD. BE HAPPY TO SIT AND TALK MORE. ABOUT THIS WITH YOU. AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY WE COULD I'M SURE THERE'S SOME. IDEAS THAT WE WOULD AGREE ON. BUT THIS ONE LIKE I JUST CAN'T A GRAND GIVEN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY HOME IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN NUMBER OF PEOPLE. WHO CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOME TO KEEP FIND WHAT TO BUY BECAUSE THEY JUST AREN'T BUILDING THEM FAST ENOUGH SO AM I APPRECIATE YOU BRING THE BILL FOR THE BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT A TODAY? MR ACOSTA THAN MR MCCARTY. UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I I THINK THAT'S A LAUDABLE GOAL. I ECHO SOME OF THE SENTIMENTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN. SHARED AYE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I MEAN I. I KEEP HEARING THAT THIS IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL WHICH IT APPEARS TO BE I'M FOR OWES VERY CONCERNED BY SOME OF THE BACK AND FORTH THOUGH ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION VERSES A STUDY. CELEBRITY A STUDY BUT I'M GONNA IMPLEMENT SAID STUDY WITHOUT IT CAME BACK TO THIS THIS SAGA. THIS BODY HAS COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH SO. DO YOU DO YOU ENVISION WITH THIS LEGISLATION IN THIS BILL. THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET TO A SITUATION WHERE IF I GO TO SELL MY HOME I HAVE TO CHANGE OUT APPLIANCES. OR RETRO FIT OR OR OR ANY OF THAT IS THAT KIND OF WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S. THE GOAL HERE. FOR EXISTING EXISTING HOMES. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S THE GOAL I DON'T I MEAN I DON'T KNOW OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT WOULD END UP BEING PART OF ANY PLAN. I WOULD HOPE THAT. WE DON'T PREMATURELY KIND OF TRY TO SECOND GUESS WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THAT PLAN AFTER LENGTHY PUBLIC HEARINGS AFTER OR. PEOPLE WAY ON THE BEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. OF REACHING OUR GOALS YOU KNOW AGAIN WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BEGIN THE GOAL SETTING PROCESS AND TO HAVE A TARGET. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE SO AFRAID OF WHAT MIGHT COME ALONG THE WAY THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN WILLING. I TRIED TO HAVE A GOAL OR TRY TO HAVE A TARGET TO REDUCE WHAT'S ONE OF OUR LARGEST SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SO UMBER. IT I COULDN'T TELL YOU RIGHT THIS MOMENT HOW THAT GOAL IS GOING TO BE MET BUT WE HEARD SOME IDEAS TODAY WE HEARD ABOUT UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WHICH CAN ALSO POWER. THOSE GAS STOVES EVERYBODY LOVES YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE GOAL PERHAPS BRINGING IN OTHER TYPES OF FUEL SOURCES A GEOTHERMAL. OF USING MORE SOLAR THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT THAT CAN BE DONE AND. OVER TIME A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS CHOOSE TO PUT MORE AFFECTION EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INTO THEIR HOMES THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY GET REBATES SOMETIMES EMPOWER UTILITIES BECAUSE THE OLD ONES. WEAR OUT AND THEY DECIDE TO REPLACE HIM AND BECAUSE NOW THERE'S MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. AND PART OF THE IDEA OF SETTING THE GOAL IS TO. TO GIVE THAT MARKET SIGNAL TO PEOPLE WHO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGY WHO DEVELOP APPLIES TO SAY THIS IS OUR GOAL. KENMORE SEARS WE WANT YOU TO START GOING OUT AND COMING UP WITH REALLY GREAT APPLIANCES THAT YOU THAT ARE. ZERO EMISSIONS WITHOUT DOING THAT WITHOUT HAVING THAT GOAL IT'S HARD TO SEND THAT MARKETS ARE GOING TO HOW TO IT'S HARD TO HAVE THOSE CHOICES MAN. COME ON THE SHELVES THE SAME WAY THAT NOW WATER EFFICIENCY CHOICES OF COME ON THE SHELVES. SO IF YOU WOULD ASK ME TEN YEARS AGO ABOUT THE DROUGHT NOT GONNA WE ARE WIENER REQUIRE HOMEOWNERS TO GO OUT AND. RETROFIT ALL OF THEIR HOUSES WITH WATER SEEPING WELL WE ENDED UP NOT GOING THERE BECAUSE THE MARKET ITSELF ONCE WE KEEP THAT SIGNAL PROVIDED THOSE APPLIANCES AND MADE THOSE CHOICES ATTRACTIVE TO CONSUMERS. SO I THINK IS A LOT BETTER WAY OF GOING ABOUT GETTING TO EFFICIENCY. AND I THINK THAT THE MARKET WILL START DOING THAT ON THEIR OWN ON ITS OWN ONCE WE SEND THOSE SIGNALS DIFFERENT THINGS TO ADD. BUT JUST OUT OF THAT YOU KNOW BY PROVIDING THIS MONTH THIS POLICY SIGNAL WILL DRIVE INNOVATION INVESTMENTS AND JUST LIKE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE PEOPLE NOW HAVE THE OPTION OF HAVING. CARS POWERED BY ELECTRICITY HYBRIDS HYDROGEN NATURAL GAS THAT HAS REPLACED THE SINGLE CHOI HAD TO HAVE WITH A DIFFICULT BUT NO A GASOLINE COMBUSTION ENGINE BEFORE THIS OF SAMETIME BILLS HOW DO WE MAKE THESE OPTIONS. WHICH ARE CHEAPER HEALTHIER CLEANER VENABLE TO THE PLOT OF POPULATIONS HAVE JUST THE WEALTHIER CALIFORNIA'S TODAY. HOW TO SAY AS WE JUST HEARD FROM THE ARCHITECTS THIS IS NOT GREENLEE THESE ARE HOUSES GO BACK THE NINETEEN TWENTIES THAT BECAUSE THAT KIND OF MONEY IT'S BECAUSE OF A LOT OF OTHER FACTORS LIKE THE PRICE OF LAND? AND OUT AND POPULATION GROWTH SO. I DON'T THINK THAT THE CONNECTION IS YOU KNOW. QUITE THAT CLEAR OBVIOUS. WELL I I DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT WAS. JUST STATED AS A LOT OF INFORMATION HERE. I. FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WE JUST HAD A BILL EARLIER REGARDING SEQUEL. I AM ONE OF MY COMMENTS ABOUT SEQUEL WAS THAT OR ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR BILL WAS THAT. WELL IT'S ONLY IF IT THAT'S NOT ALL OF THAT THAT'S ONLY A PART OF IT. AND THEN HERE WE ARE. EVEN SO SO GO AHEAD AND DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT SEQUEL AND THEN OUR HERE AND WORK ADDING TO THE COST OF. OF OF HOUSING STOCKS IN CALIFORNIA POTENTIALLY. BIG WITH THESE MANDATES I'M WE CAN AGREE AND DISAGREE CAN CHECK YOUR HAD THAT I THAT WITH ALL RESPECT SIR. I FIND IT REALLY DISCONCERTING WHEN YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD IN THE FRONT ROW FOR EVERYONE TO SEE. DISAGREEING WITH THE FOLKS THAT ARE UP HERE GIVING THEIR EXPERT TESTIMONY. I I REALLY RESENT THAT. IS YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY EXPERT IN THIS ROOM I GUARANTEE OF SIR. SO I WOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT WHEN I'M SPEAKING. THAT YOU GIVE ME SOME COURTESY AND NOT SHAKE YOUR HEAD ROLL YOUR EYES AS YOU JUST DID. PLEASE I DON'T I DON'T NEED A COMMENT I JUST NEED YOU TO SIT THERE AND NOT ROLL YOUR EYES AT ME BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY DISRESPECTFUL. OKAY. SO. I'M GONNA CONTINUE ON HERE AND I'M. WITHOUT LOSING MY TEMPER WITH ONE OF THE WITNESSES. SO WE HAVE THESE ISSUES GOING ON CALIFORNIA WERE CALLING A HOUSING CRISIS A CRISIS IF YOU CRISIS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS. HAS EVER IN OUR STATE HAS EVER FACED. WHERE WE ARE NOT ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING? EXCEPT EXACERBATE SAID CRISIS. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON SECA WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ON ON. I'M KEEPING THE COST AND COST CONTAINMENT DOWN WERE IT WE HAVE. SOME TESTIMONY THAT SAYS THIS WILL INCREASE COSTS WE WILL ATTEST MY SAYS IT WON'T WE'RE GONNA DO A PLAN WHICH I AM ALL FOR STUDY BILL. BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN WITHOUT COMING BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR. CHAMBER IN THIS COMMITTEE SO I DON'T SEE HOW THIS IS GOING TO HELP OUR HOUSING CRISIS I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW. WITHOUT MORE FACTS. OTHER THAN THE LOT OF SUPPOSITION. THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. ANYWHERE WITHOUT ADDING A HUGE COST IN A BURDEN TO NEW HOMEOWNERS AS I MENTIONED PRIOR OUR CHILDREN CANNOT AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. FIFTH PERIOD UNLESS THEY'RE VERY LUCKY AND GO TO WORK FOR A TECH COMPANY OR SOME OTHER. YOU KNOW GET GET IN THERE AND DIRT THE BLUE COLLAR WORKERS FOR EXAMPLE ARE BEING DRIVEN OUT AND THEIR CURRENT BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THE SUBURBS AND THEY WERE NOT LETTING THE SUBURBS BUILT HOUSES EITHER. AND IT'S BILLS LIKE THIS THAT R. STUNTING THAT GROWTH I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU ON A BILL THAT DOESN'T IN MY HUMBLE OPINION. BOB HARM WHAT WORKED THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF TRYING TO PRODUCE MORE HOUSING WHILE WE'RE BEING CLEANER AND I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE VEHICLE FOR IT I LOVE TO SEE IT AS A STUDY BILL. BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW I AM A VERY FIRM NO ON THIS PARTICULAR GOVERNOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING REALLY APPRECIATED. BUT. THANK YOU FIRST OF ALL AS THIS BILL BEEN MOVED. HOW MOVE THAT THAT KNOWS? BUT SYSTEM MADE. SECOND OKAY AND THEN JUST JUST SOME THOUGHTS ON THIS AND SO I I SUPPORT THIS MEASURE RIGHT I NOTICE IT'S JUST THREE WORDS A CAT TEMPERATE THE PLAN. IT'S FIFTY PERCENT TWENTY THIRTY IS A LOT OF VARIABLES TO IMPLEMENT THIS. I WILL KNOW THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING STOCK EVEN NOT HOT AREA LIKE SACRAMENTO. NOW IN WHEN WE HAD THE LAST HOUSING BOOM TEN YEARS AGO. THESE NET ZERO ZERO EMISSION HOMES FOR SALE THEIR THE HOT SELLERS BECAUSE. AS YOU NOTED SOME ARCHITECTS CAN SAVE A CAN MAKE THESE RIGHT AT THE COST MARGINS. OF THE OTHER HOMES BUT SOMETIMES EVEN A LITTLE BIT MORE THE HOMEOWNER SEES WHAT THEY WILL GET BACK IN THERE ENERGY SAVINGS AND I DON'T THINK WE. WE I. TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT THAT TODAY AND SO. I THINK IT'S IT'S CRITICAL THAT ELEMENT. NOT TO NOT TO MENTION THAT I THINK IF WE'RE GOING TO. ADDRESS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE OUR ENERGY COSTS ARE CRITICAL COMPONENT AND. THAT THIS IS A NEW HOMES ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT RETROFITTING A NO THAT WAS DISCUSSED HERE BUT I THINK THAT. THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT'S WHERE AND. YOU HAVE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE YOU COULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT RIGHT AND YOU CAN BRING THE COST DOWN TO REALLY MAKE IT. MANAGEABLE WORKABLE SO THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISS FRIEDMAN. IDEA. WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE CONCERN RAISED ABOUT HOW. THIS YOUR BILL. REQUIRES THE CC TO DEVELOP A PLAN. WITHOUT THE PLAN COMING BACK. TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR. REVIEW. WELL FIRST OF ALL. ARE THERE ANY PENALTIES IN YOUR. PROPOSED YOUR BILL. FOR THE FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NO. SO I SEE ON THE BILL ANALYSES. ON PAGE THREE ITEM NUMBER FOUR. YOUR BILL REQUIRES THAT THE PLAN AND STRATEGY DEVELOPED BY THE C. C. INCLUDE THE ADOPTION OF POLICY CHANGES NEEDED. AND AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY REGULATIONS TO CHEAP THE GOALS OF THIS BILL. DO YOU WELL. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED. WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. REVIEW THESE POLICY CHANGES BEFORE THEY'RE ADOPTED. OR DE SEE. THAT IS PART OF YOUR. STRATEGY. TO HAVE THE CC ADOPT THE REGULATIONS WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. IT CERTAINLY DISCUSS THAT THIS IS REALLY THE BEGINNING OF THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THESE BILLS ABOUT THIS BILL SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR COMMITTEE. WITH A NEXT COMMITTEE THAT'LL GO TO WHICH IS THE. ENERGY AND UTILITIES COMMITTEE AND WITH THE MY FELLOW MEMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS ALL OF THESE CONCERNS. SO THAT WE YOU KNOW WE ARE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT. PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH YES. I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. ALSO THE THE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST. WELL I. APPRECIATE YOUR. YOUR BILL HERE AS A A BOLD STEP FORWARD TO SET THE GOAL FOR THE. FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE J. SHE EMISSIONS AND FOR THAT REASON I WILL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. BUT I A. I AM CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW. WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA WE LIKE TO. TO LEAD. AND. THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING. THE. PERHAPS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF. OF. COSTS ON. WEEKLY ON. ARE LOW INCOME AND MIDDLE CLASS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. IS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR BILL SPECIFICALLY I IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CDC HAS. LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN PLACE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. OF THE COST IMPLICATIONS OF THEIR POLICIES BUT IS THERE ANYTHING SPECIFIC IN YOUR BILL THAT ADDRESSES THESE COSTS ISSUES WE ARE HAPPY TO LONG PUT LANGUAGE INTO THE BILL THAT THE INSTRUCTS THEM TO TAKE A COSTS PARTICULARLY WITH LOW INCOME WITH AGRICULTURE WITH A DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED INDUSTRIES. I'M INTO ACCOUNT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE WE HEAR THOSE CONCERNS WE ARE YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THEM AND. OUR INTENT IS NOT TO STOP THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA BY ANY MEANS. ALRIGHT. WHICH LIKE CLOSE. I JUST I KNOW THAT THIS IS ARM. KIND OF BIG IDEA POLICY BUT I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THOSE GOALS AND I WE HEAR THE CONCERNS WE DON'T JUST DISAGREE WITH A LOT OF THE CONCERNS WE ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT IS THIS BILL PROGRESSES THAT THEY ARE DRESSED SO THAT. WE CAN TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT BUT WE ALSO FEEL THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME THAT WE TAKE A BOLD STEP. OF CHARTING TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR AND THIS WILL BE THERE REALLY THE FIRST STEP TO DO THAT IN A VERY COMPREHENSIVE PLAN WAY AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IT BE DONE. IT IN THAT KIND OF WITH THAT KIND OF CONCERTED EFFORTS WITHOUT I WILL ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS A TO PASS AS AMENDED TO UTILITIES AND ENERGY. AND WITH THAT MADAM SECRETARY LOCAL. I AM TWENTY SIX A. B. THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO BY MEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFER TO UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE.

STONE I. THREE BELLEZZA. ALRIGHT MS CLAUDIA I SEE YOU'VE BEEN PATIENTLY WAITING THE FLOOR IS YOURS WIKIA. I GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT TO AB TWENTY THREE ONE. A BILL THAT HELPS CALIFORNIA'S AIR RESOURCE BOARD OR THE A ARE BE COMBAT VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED TO EVADE. CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR LAWS. NEW MOTOR VEHICLES ARE SUBJECT TO EMISSION TEST BY THE AIR BE TO VERIFY COMPLIANCE WITH. CALIFORNIA EMISSION LAWS HOWEVER DEVICES EXIST THAT CAN ENABLE A VEHICLE TO FOOL. ITS EMISSIONS TESTING. IN A PROMINENT EXAMPLE IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT VOLKSWAGEN HAD INSTALLED THIS THAT WOULD BE SO CALLED DEFEAT DEVICES. AND MANY OF THEIR CARS. THESE DEVICES WERE DISCOVERED IN PART DUE TO REAL WORLD TESTING DATA THAT HELP DETECT THESE DEVICES WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNDISCOVERED BOWL. AND LABORATORY SETTINGS THE AIR BE OPEN AN INVESTIGATION AND FOUND THAT EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND VOLKSWAGEN DIESEL VEHICLES REGISTERED IN CALIFORNIA. ADMITTED EXCESSIVE NEUTRALS OXIDE A TOXIC POLLUTANTS. CALIFORNIA HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN CLEANING UP THE AIR AND FIGHTING AGAINST POLLUTANTS BUT VOLKSWAGEN'S DECEPTION WAS PARTICULARLY DAMAGING BECAUSE MANY PARTS OF THE STATE STILL EXPERIENCE. SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION. THIS FACT COUPLED WITH RECENT ATTEMPTS BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ROLLBACK CALIFORNIA'S. NATION LEADING CLEAN AIR LAWS MEANS THAT WE MUST ACT TO UPHOLD THE SAFEGUARDS OF FOR THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE AND OUR RESIDENTS. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE. I WOULD PARTNER WITH A R. B. WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS LABORATORIES AND EXPERTS IN ORDER TO ENHANCE THEIR NEW MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSIONS TESTING PROGRAM AND DISCOVER THESE DEFEAT DEVICES. AB TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE WILL ALSO GIVE THE AIR BE THE ABILITY TO SECURE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO PERFORM MORE INDEPENDENT TESTING IN ORDER TO STAY AT THE FOREFRONT OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S. AIR FROM THOSE WHO WOULD VIOLATE OUR LAWS POLLUTER ENVIRONMENT AND HARM OUR RESIDENTS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFIED IS WILLIAM BARRETTE A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST AT THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA. LIKE YOU VERY MUCH HAVE HAPPY TO BE HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO SOME THE MOST DIFFICULT AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES IN THE UNITED STATES UNHEALTHY AIR WHICH IS LARGELY DRIVEN IN OUR STATE BY MOBILE SOURCES ARE PASSENGER VEHICLES CARS TRUCKS. AND BUSES. AFFECTS THE LONG HEALTH IN MANY FORMS INCLUDING. CAUSING ASTHMA ATTACKS STARTED LONG LONG DEVELOPMENT AND ONE FUNCTION IN CHILDREN. LUNG CANCER AND PREMATURE DEATHS. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE LUNG ASSOCIATION PUBLISHED A REPORT THAT FOUND FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN HEALTH. I CLIMATE DAMAGES PER YEAR IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO THE PASSENGER VEHICLE FLEET POLLUTION FROM OUR CARS AND TRUCKS ON THE ROAD. THIS IS WHY CALIFORNIA'S STRONGER THE NATIONAL POLICIES ARE SO IMPORTANT WHEN COMPLIED WITH OUR STATES EMISSION RULES ARE HAVING A DRAMATIC AFFECT ON CLEAN UP BARRIER. AND LESSENING THESE IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE CLEARLY NEED GREATER ASSURANCE THAT THESE RULES ARE WORKING IN DELIVERING REAL WORLD BENEFITS AND ARE NOT BEING UNDERMINED BY VOLKSWAGENS OF THE WORLD ARE OTHER MANUFACTURERS DECEPTIONS. A OR OTHER FAILURES TO POINT. TO COMPLY WITH THE RULES FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE. AB TWENTY THIRTY EIGHTY ONE TWENTY THREE EIGHTY ONE I'M SORRY WOULD ALLOW AIR BE TO COLLECT FEES FOR MANUFACTURERS TO ENHANCE MOTOR VEHICLE EMISSION TESTING PROGRAMS. TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPLIANCE ACROSS IN USE. ON ROAD ANOTHER REAL WORLD DRIVING SETTINGS ARE DELIVERING THOSE REAL WORLD WIENER BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIANS THIS BILL ADVANCES PUBLIC HEALTH AND CLEAN AIR IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARCHERS SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. KYLE JOINS US HERE FOR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SEEING. NO OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT COMING FOR WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO WITNESSES COMING FORWARD TO A QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MUCH HAS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED NO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IT'S GOT A WEIGHT WHICH LIKE CLOSE. GIVE US A CHAIRED MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHARES RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO TRANSPORTATION.

THANK YOU FOR WAITING PATIENTLY. AND THERE'S. STRUCK NO YEAH I HAVE A VERY VERY MUCH A MISTER CHAIRED BY MEMBER. OF FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS STEP FOR A WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. I'LL LOOK I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE A AN AMENDMENT. A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS WHO DISTRICT BAIL. ADDRESSING THE LOCAL OLD OR IT ISSUES THERE HAS BEEN A PROBLEM FOR MY CONSTITUENT AND CAUSING SCHOOL CLOSURES. IN MY AREA. DISPELLED. MY SOUND FAMILIAR FOR MANY OF YOU HERE BECAUSE SEE THE A SIMILAR BILLS. PASS ALL DOCTORS COMEDIAN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AT THE SAME TIME. THE LOCAL. OPERATORS IN AND STARTED OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. OF THE A GROUP CALLED SALISBURY OLDER TASK FORCE. AND FOUND I WAS HOPEFUL. THAT IT WILL SERVE AS A PLACE FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND CITIES HAVE FACILITIES. THAT COULD BE A THE FIRST FORCES SOLVE ORDERS TO WORK TOGETHER AND I'M WORK ON REMEDIES. AND I HAVE TO. EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION IN PUBLIC. FOR THOSE STAKEHOLDERS EFFORTS SO FAR. BUT NOT ORDER NOW ALL OF. DE. THE OPERATORS ARE. REGULARLY A ATTENDING BECAUSE. QUARTERLY MEETING. SO WITHOUT HAVING ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. I FELT A GROUP CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. AND AB NIGHT HINGED. I CONSERVATIVE FIVE WILL BRING ALL THIS THOSE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. PROMOTE CORPORATION WHO COOPERATION AND FIND A SOLUTION. TO SOLVE THE ISSUE DE HOUSE BEING IMPACTING PEOPLE. LIVING IN MY AREA AND LIVING AND WORKING IN MY AREA I HELP HER COMPLAIN FROM SENT DISK. AND AND THEY WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY TO RECRUIT WORKERS BECAUSE. ONE DAY PARK THEIR CARD IN FOND IN FRONT OF THE YEAR FACILITY HE SAID THE MANY PEOPLE CAME IMPAIR TO SMILE. OF OFTEN. IN THAT DISTRICT. SO A. A AGAIN. THIS BILL. IS TO FORMALIZE A CURRENT TASKFORCE. YOU BRING STAKEHOLDERS TO BRING ALL STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER TO WORK ON THE SOLUTION. AND YOU'RE NO ADDITIONAL PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS OR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ATTACHED TO THIS BILL. AND THIS BILL. IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO SHUT DOWN ENDING A OPERATORS. BUT JUST TO MAKE SURE OR DATA YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL COEXIST IN AND AND AND DOING VITAMIN. I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT BOARD. NOW OWNED CLARIFYING SOME AMENDMENTS AND AND. I'M HAPPY NOW WILL BE CONTINUE. TO WORKING WITH THEM AS A BILL MOVE FORWARD. SO THAT WAS THAT ARE YOU. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR OF. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHIU DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF. THIS BILL. PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON TOM EDISON WITH THE BAY AREA AIR DISTRICT. NOT QUITE IN SUPPORT BUT WE'RE VERY CLOSE WE APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE OFFERS OF WORK WITH US TRYING TO GET TO SOMETHING. THAT WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT GENERALLY QUITE LIKE THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE ODORS I IN MILPITAS THEN ADJACENT TOWNS IS. APPROPRIATE. SOUTH THEY ORDER STAKEHOLDERS GROUP. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS HAS BEEN HINDERED BY THE FACT THAT NOT EVERYONE'S PARTICIPATING SO WE THINK THAT THEY SHOULD HELP OUT. AYE END GET US ARE CONTINUING. ON THE ROADS ARE LESS NOW. ANY OTHER WITNESSES. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FOR. MISTER CHAIR JUST MALANA BEHALF OF THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES VERY MUCH RELUCTANTLY IN OPPOSITION. AND THE ONLY REASON THE OPPOSITE WE OPPOSING THIS BILL IS NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T SUPPORT WHAT IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE. AND EIGHT WE RARELY CON START HAVING STATURE TREE OBLIGATIONS ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COORDINATE. THERE IS PLENTY OF STATUTE IN PLACE TO REQUIRE ADEQUATE OVERVIEW THIS THAT. TO IMPACT MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT HAS TO BE APPROVED. I'M SO RAW THEN LOAD UP MORE LOW'S. TO DEAL WITH LOCAL ISSUES THAT SHOULD BE DONE. CERTAINLY WITH IN THE CURRENT LAW WE WOULD OFFERED DID LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO STEP IN IF THEY HAVEN'T STEPPED IN. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BUT WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE MOVE REALLY DON'T SEE A NEED FOR A BILL THANK YOU. CARE MARTINSON ON BEHALF OF THAT CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I'M HERE BUT THE VERY SIMILAR ARE GOOD ARGUMENTS MY COLLEAGUE JUST IN MILAN. I JUST LIKE TO ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO SETTING A PRECEDENT. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SOME OF OUR LARGER I SEE WHY POLICY GOALS. WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX OUR COMMERCIAL ORGANICS RECYCLING LAWS WERE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. A REGULATIONS TO IMPLEMENT S. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE WHICH READ REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT OUR PRODUCTION OF METHANE EMISSIONS FROM LANDFILLS AND US. A SIGNIFICANT DIVERSION OF ORGANIC MATERIAL WE I NEED ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MANAGE THIS PORTION OF THE WASTE STREAM WHICH WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE SO. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT WITH THE PRESIDENT LIKE THIS. BUT WE COULD SEE POTENTIAL POLICY IMPACTS ON SOME OF OUR LARGER STATE RECALLS. UNFORTUNATELY IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IT'S YOUR DESIRE TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES IN THE CITY OF MILPITAS. TO CONTROL ORDER AT ITS FACILITY REPUBLIC HAS INVESTED NEARLY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. OPERATIONAL ENHANCEMENTS AND FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE THE POTENTIAL ORDER IMPACTS ARE MINIMIZED AND ELIMINATED ON SITE. WE ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE CREATES A DUKE DUPLICATIVE EXPENSIVE COMPLEX AND INEFFECTIVE PROCESS THAT WILL NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT SEEKS TO RESOLVE. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REFLECTS THAT THERE IS ALREADY EXTENSIVE REGULATION OF ORDER IT ISSUES BY AIR DISTRICTS FOR MOST OF THE ORDER SOURCES AND CAL RECYCLING THE LA RAIL. FOR COMPOST OPERATIONS. FIRST THE RESULTS OF A RECENTLY RELEASED ODOR A BRASS SOURCES CHARACTERS ACTION CHARACTERIZATION STUDY. CONDUCTED AROUND THE CITY OF MILPITAS. SHOWS THAT NATURAL SOURCES THAT IS THE EVAN FLOW OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY WATERS. WHERE THE DOMINANT SOURCE OF REGIONAL ODORS? NEITHER SAYS SOURCES OF THESE ODORS NOR THE VOTERS THEMSELVES WILL GO AWAY. WHILE BEING WELL AWARE OF THE VOTER SOURCES IN THE AREA LAND USE POLICIES WERE ADOPTED OVER THE YEARS. THAT AUTHORIZED HOUSING IN THE CITY OF MILPITAS. TO BE BUILT CLOSER TO THESE NATURAL ODORS. THESE NATURAL SOURCES OF MOTOR FURTHER BIG EXACERBATING THE PROBLEM. THE NEWBIE ISLAND HAS UNDERGONE AN EXTENSIVE LOCALLY AND USE PROCESS SOLID WASTE FACILITIES PERMITTING PROCESS AND MANY OF REPUBLICS OPERATIONS ALSO REQUIRE WATER DISTRICT APPROVAL AN AIR DISTRICT APPROVAL. ALL OF THESE PROCESSES ARE TRANSPARENT AND OPEN UP TO THE PUBLIC. THIS SOUTH BAY ORDER STAKEHOLDERS GROUP THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER REFERENCED WAS FORMED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. ABC NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE REQUIRES A STATE A STATE TASK FORCE THAT REPLICATES THE LOCAL TASK FORCE. I MIGHT ADD THAT THERE'S NOTHING IN THE LOCAL TASK FORCE THAT COMPELS PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. FURTHER THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WILL COMPEL ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE. AND THEREFORE I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME OUTCOME. THAT IS ANOTHER STATUTE BUT THERE'S NOT GOING TO BE A DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME. SO WITHOUT FURTHER MORE. THE LOCAL ASK GET WORSE CANNOT A MAP OF CANNOT BE ELIMINATED BECAUSE IT'S A CONDITION OF OUR PERMITS. SO FOR ALL OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REASONS WE BELIEVE THAT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. DESERVES YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JOSH PANAY I'M BE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA REFUSE RECYCLING COUNCIL A HUNDRED COMPANIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT DO THIS EXACT WORK AND RUN INTO THESE LOCAL ISSUES. AS A FORMER MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL HERE IN SACRAMENTO I DEALT WITH THESE ISSUES AND THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE. THIS THIS AND ALL THE FACILITIES EXCEPT FOR THE NATURAL PROBLEM THAT OCCURS IN THIS AREA WHICH THE STUDY FOUND WAS THE PROBLEM. AYE YEAH. IS AND PLACED THAT PROCESS IS A GOOD PROCESS WE WOULD URGE YOU OF RESPECTFULLY ASK TO OPPOSE THIS BILL TO VOTE NO AND WE'VE SPOKEN TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE ABOUT THIS AND OUR STATE WIDE IMPLICATIONS TO IT. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. OKAY. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS KELLY ASTRA BEHALF OF THE. SEE LA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION SOLVE ASSOCIATION ORANGE COUNTY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE DISPOSAL ASSOCIATION ALL THREE REGIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATIONS. REGRETTED THAT THERE NEED TO OPPOSE THE BILL LARGELY BECAUSE OF THE DISASTROUS IMPACTS SUCH. BUT THE PRESIDENT HIS BILL WOULD SET IN TERMS OF FACILITY OF ELEMENTS SUSTAINED OPERATION THEREBY HAMPERING OUR BILLION OBTAIN THE ROOF RECYCLING GOALS ARE IN LAW NOW THANK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS STEVE CARLTON TO ATHENS SERVICES WHERE LARGE SHOW SOLID WASTE RECYCLING A. PROVIDER IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE MUST ALSO REGRETTABLY OPPOSE THE BILL AS YOU WILL HEAR. US TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF MR MAIENSCHEIN BILL COMING UP THE NEED FOR MORE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS STATE IS CRITICAL IT'S BEYOND CRITICAL. BUT ANYTHING PARTICULARLY A BILL LIKE THIS WHICH IS NOT GONNA OF NOT GOING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM BUT CAN TO CREATE MORE. OF HIS SPEECH IS THE. NOT WELL FOUNDED WE WOULD HURT YOU A NO VOTE. MARY PEDAL LIST PEARL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS EGGMAN THEN MISTER SHOW. I. THINK YOU THINK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD. LIKE I STATED EARLIER WHEN ANYTHING SYMBOL SHYNESS IS TRASH AND WE CONTINUE TO MAKE POLICIES THAT. MANDATE THAT WE RECYCLE AND AND REDUCE LANDFILLS AND WE A LOT OF THINGS THAT THAT REQUIRE A LOT OF MONEY FROM INDUSTRY. AND THEN AND THEN WE GET CONCERNED ABOUT SMELLS AND THINGS. THEN AGAIN AS STATED IN WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THERE'S ALREADY A PROCESS OF PLACE THIS JUST KIND OF PUTS THE ONUS BACK ONTO THAT THE LANDFILL FOLKS WHO SEEM TO BE. HAVE BEEN GOOD PARTNERS IN THIS HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE HAVE BEEN WORKING. ASSEMBLY ABLE SUPPORT YOU BUILT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON. IT DID I THINK YOU'RE SO. TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT AFTER THE STAKEHOLDERS TO A LOT OF. A GROUP WAS SO ESTABLISHED TWENTY FOURTEEN. BUT AGAIN. GOOD NOW ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE PARTICIPATING. AND IN THIS A A TASK FORCE. SO I'M HOPING TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CHEESE TO THIS TASK FORCE. TO ENCOURAGE. ALL. STAKEHOLDER TO PARTICIPATE TO YOU DO ALL TO WORK TO REPUBLICANS TO ONE THAT THAT WAS REALLY THE FINAL GOAL. AGAIN WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE DEBT THEY COULD BE THAT GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN. MP COLE EXIST WHISKEY EXISTING. A COMMUNITY JUSTICE SERVED VERY VERY DISTRICT BILL I APPRECIATE THOSE PEOPLE. THAT FLYING UP FROM LOS ANGELES OR OTHER PART OF HIS ESTATE TO CAST UPON. I WISH MY I'M A LITTLE BIT TO MIDDLE CLASS SIR. RESIDENTS IN MY DISTRIBUTIVE BE HERE WAS ALL OF THOSE TO TESTIFY. BUT THEY DO REAL GOOD RIDLEY ARE REALLY HAVE TO WORK WELL HAVE RECEIVED. A LOT OF LETTERS AND PHONE CALLS AND VOTE TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THIS IS SO UNIQUE SITUATION HERE. YOU KNOW THOSE LAND IS ON THE MOORS TIP OF A FINGER. ACTUALLY IN THE CHORE FOR THAT PICTURE. ALL FIRST CITY OFF SOME HOSTING FOR THE RECORD YOUR INDEX FINGER. RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT THERE THE HIP. RYAN THAT PICKED OF THOSE OF SAN JOSE. BUT THERE IS NO A THIS HUMBLE TO ADDRESS ADJOURNS. GOD LOVE. PROBABLY TEN TWENTY MILES AWAY FROM THIS THAT LIVE FEEL. HOWEVER. SURROUNDING NEIGHBORS. WHO THE COULD DECIDE SANTA CLARA AND DECIDE MILPITAS? HOUSE. A LOT THE ADDRESS AT THE STATE. HAVE NO WAY OF EVEN THE TO TO TO HAVE CLEAR VOICE HEARD ABOUT BUILT SAID BACK FEEL. HER OF ALL THOSE WHO THAT WATER TREATMENT PLANT AND OF A DOLPHIN LEAD TO SOME ISSUE WITH. BUILD BETTER PAY AND THAT'S WELL THAT'S WHAT THIS TAX WILL JUST IMPORTANT. SHOWED THE CITY OF SAN JOSE THE LEADER TRUMP'S APPEAL FELL HOPEFULLY. BE ABLE TO HEAR WHAT THE WHAT THE RESIDENTS IN SANTA CLARA AND MOVE PETER I HAVE TO SAY WHEN THE CITY WHEN THE CITY OF SAN JOSE'S MAKING THAT DECISION. QUOTE THAT THE FUTURE OF BILL FLAK FEEL. AND AGAIN. REALLY A DIFFERENT BILL WOULD TRYING TO. PICKED A PALE HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO. OPENED UP WILL WASH WOULD HAVE LIKED TO. POTS SO PUBLIC. PASSPORTS. WILL BE MUCH MUCH MORE WELCOMING TO THE REST OF IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IN THE PUBLIC PUBLICLY OF PUBLIC MEMBER. TO. PHARAOH WHO. DISCOURAGE TUBES TO PARTICIPATE. IN TO DISCUSS SALISBURY OLDER PASSWORD. BECAUSE IT'S IT'S REALLY A CLOSE. THE WAR YOU OVER YOU KNOW THE FOOTPATH WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS. GOOD ADAIR MEETING. BUT I SO ONCE WE BAKER OF PLOTS I PUBLIC. I THINK WE'LL BE WOULD LOVE REALLY WELCOMING THE PUBLIC. COMMENT. TO SPEAK. TWO VERY GOOD POST STAKEHOLDER. SO. FACT. PRETTY MUCH DO THE REASON BEHIND THIS BILL BUT YOU'RE MAKING THEM. CONTINUE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS A LANDFILL AND THE LANDFILL PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO'VE BEEN AT THE TABLE THE WHOLE TIME. THERE TO. THE DATE THAT DEFINITELY TED LEFT TO GO. TRUE BILL A BIT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOING THAT THAT THE PROBLEM. AND THAT'S WHY ONCE WE HAVE THAT THIS WILL PROTECT BOTH HOUSE BUILDER TASK FORCE SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. KNOWN AND FIGURE A. THEY TESTIFIED DIDN'T. THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS DROPPED SIGNIFICANT. SO I DO BELIEVE THIS IS THE OPERATIONAL ISSUE. DOUBLE CAN BE ADDRESSED. YOU KNOW AND I'M HOPING THAT WAS TO TASK FORCE WE CAN'T ADDRESS TO THE OPERATIONAL ISSUE. THIS IS NOT TRYING TO SHUT DOWN INNING OF THE OTHER OPERATORS. UNION AND SILICON VALLEY WE DEAL WITH FILCH ISSUE BEFORE. IN THE LATE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WOULD FIND OUT THAT THE FREE ON. IS REALLY REALLY BY BAD FOR THE OLD YOU KNOW THE DEPLETION OF VOLUME BREATH WE DIDN'T FIT INTO ALL OUT OF SANTA CLARA. THE WE ASKED INTEL TO ADDRESS. GOOD GOOD YOU SHOOT TO REDUCE TO THE USAGE OFFERING ALL OR TO REPLACE THE WITH SOME OTHER OF SOLVING TO CLAIM THEIR THEIR SUBTREES. AND ND AND NOW YOU KNOW WOULD WE COEXIST. AND INTEL HAS BEING A WONDERFUL. AND CORPORATE CITIZEN IN THE DISTRICT AND TO SPILL WITH PRETTY MUCH ASKING. GOES LIVE DO DOES THE. OF LACK FEEL TO TO DO THE SAME. AND SPIN PROVEN GOT DATE WAS VAGUE IMPROVE OF THEIR OPERATION. THE NUMBER OF TO COMPLAIN DROPPED. FROM BILL. TWENTY THIRTY FORTY TWO A DAY TO MAYBE A FEEL. IN THE MONTH SO WE SHOULD KEEP. GOING THAT DIRECTION. MEASURES CHAU. THANK YOU CRAP THE REPRESENTED FROM THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. YOU'RE THE REGULATOR. WE ARE THE REGULATOR ALTHOUGH NOT FOR ALL ODORS. HERE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE USED TO REGULATE ALL ORDERS BUT COMPOST VOTERS WERE REMOVED FROM. LOCAL AIR DISTRICT AUTHORITY PERHAPS A DOZEN YEARS AGO. SO WE DON'T REGULATE COMPOSTING ORDERS THAT'S THAT. A TASK THAT IS OWNED BY THE LA AREA OTHER ORDERS I IN THE AREA. WE RESPOND TO ABSOLUTE RIGHT NOT TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. OKAY BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT MADE I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME WHO WAS THE REGULATOR IN THIS. TO TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP AND YOU CAME FOR HIS HAIRDRESSER CAN YOU SAID YOU LIKE THIS. BY. THAT THAT. THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS IS REALLY THAT IF YOU'RE NOT THE REGULATOR. AND YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS THAN THAN WHAT IS THEIR QUALITIES DISTRICTS ROLE. SO WE'RE IN CHARGE OF DEALING WITH NUISANCE ODOR COMPLAINTS FROM ALL SOURCES. OTHER THAN COMPOSTING HERE THE SOURCES OF ODOROUS IN. IN THE AREA FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS THE REGULATORY BODY THAT MOST DEALS WITH NEWS AND SENATORS. THERE'S THE LANDFILL. THERE'S THE COMPOSTING OPERATION THERE'S THE SORTING OF MATERIALS. AT THAT FACILITY. THERE IN FACT OR THE BAY LANDS THEMSELVES AYE ANAEROBIC BACTERIA UNDER ANAEROBIC CONDITIONS NOW. THERE IS ALSO Z. WED ZERO WAYS DOT THERE'S ANY ANAEROBIC. ORGANICS. FACILITY MAKING. YEAH ARE USING ORGANICS IN AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTION PROCESS TO MAKE NATURAL GAS. THERE'S. THE THE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. CITY OF SAN JOSE SANTA CLARA MAJOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT FOR THE SOUTH DAY. THERE'S A PUMPING STATION IN MILPITAS THOSE ARE ALL SOURCES OF NUISANCE VOTERS IN THE AREA. DEPENDING ON THE DAY AND DEPENDING WHAT WHAT'S HAPPENING EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES. AND AND YOU'RE THE REGULATOR FOR SOME. PART OF THIS BUT NOT ALL. THAT'S TRUE INDEED OKAY HOW HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT THIS IN HIS CREATE THIS CREATION OF THE TASK FORCE. AN APPROPRIATE STEP. IT IS HARD TO GET THE PARTIES TO THE TABLE. A THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE GOT WE GOT A. SLP ORDER STAKEHOLDERS GROUP NOW NOT FRANKLY IS A VERY HELPFUL THING NAM. AS THEY BOTH REPUBLIC IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED. OF THE SITUATION IS IMPROVING THAT'S A GOOD THING WE'VE SEEN PROGRESS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT I WOULD SUGGEST OF OPERATIONAL. STEPS THAT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT SOURCES HAVE TAKEN STEPS THAT. I WOULD SUGGEST HAVE LARGELY BEEN DRIVEN BY THE REGULATOR IN THIS CASE MY AGENCY. SO WE'VE WORKED WITH THE ODOR SOURCES TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR IS TO CUT ODORS THE PROBLEM HOUSING GONE AWAY. YOU'VE GOT HOUSING. IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NOW. TO A LANDFILL THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR NOT A HUNDRED YEARS BUT GETTING CLOSE. HOWEVER LIKE TO GET TO THIS MONTH SAYS YOU DO REPRESENT THAT. THE ELEAZER IN THIS THE CENTER THE REGULATORS. I TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT PATH IS I DON'T SEE THERE'S NO TEETH IN THIS. IF THIS GETS MOVE FORWARD. WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE. THE SADDEST CHO DOESN'T REALLY CHANGE. SO. WHO'S IN CHARGE LISTA CHAIR THROUGH YOU TO TO TRY TO RESPOND TO IT. IT'S PROBABLY EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO THAT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COSTA PASTA BILL AND THAT ACTUALLY CLARIFIED THAT THE PRIMACY AGENCY IS THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY THE SOLID IN THE SOLID WASTE. MANAGEMENT AGENCY THE AMBER THE ENVIRONMENT HEALTH FOLKS. AND THE REASON THAT WAS DONE IS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY ISSUE THE PERMIT. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS CLEARLY THERE HAVE BEEN OVER OTA PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS. AS WITH ANYTHING AS WITH WASTE WATER TREATMENT OR. ABATTOIR UNITED SLAUGHTERHOUSES SOMETHING THERE ARE OD ISSUES. THE ISSUE WITH THE MOLE WAS THAT THE ED DISTRICTS HAVE EXPLICIT AUTHORITY. TO ADDRESS ODORS AND THEY HAVE FINES AND PENALTIES AUTHORITY. ALL CONCERN WAS THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACTUALLY ISSUE THE PERMITS AND AT THAT TIME WE CREATED THIS PROCESS SCHOOL O. TO IMPACT MATT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM. AND THAT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO MITIGATE TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT POSSIBLE THOSE OTIS WE CANNOT ELIMINATE THEM. SO THE ISSUE AS PRIMARILY ONE OF LAND USE NOT OF IN ADEQUATE REGULATION BY THE NE A OR CALORIE CYCLE OR ANYBODY ELSE YOU GO PEOPLE MOVING INTO A NUISANCE. AS YOU DO ALL THE TIME. AS YOU SQUEEZE HOUSES RIGHT UP TO THE AGE SO YOU HAD A PRE EXISTING LAND FULL. NOW YOU STILL HAVE SOME. DOES IN THE LANDFILL BUT WE HAVE THE PLAN IN PLACE. OUR CONCERN AS OTHERS HAVE ARTICULATED AS YOU TRY TO ADDRESS RECYCLING IN THE STATE. THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IS GOING TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND IT OBFUSCATE. IN PROCESS. BUT THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION AND I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A FURTHER RESPONSE IT'S JUST HARD TO KNOW WHAT TO DO. WITH THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT CHANGES ANYTHING ON THE GROUNDS AND MISCHA I'M I'M PREPARED TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT THAT OUT HERE. IN THE U. GONNA REALLY STRUGGLE WITH THIS ON THE FLOOR. BECAUSE. IT'S ITS A SOLUTION THAT MAY SATISFY SOME FOLKS BUT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS JUST. CUT A SPINNING O. WE'LL AND AND ULTIMATELY NOT REALLY. GOING TO. TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM IT'S IT'S UP TO LOCAL REGULATORS I DON'T OF THE COW RECYCLE THIS THE RIGHT. PARTY TO BE DOING THIS NECESSARILY. AND. I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO GET PAID FOR ULTIMATELY BECAUSE YOU'RE CREATING. A PROCESS AND AND HANDING IT TO. THE STATE AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EXPECTED TO SPEND MONEY TO TO GO SOLVE THE PROBLEM SO IT'S. IT IT'S A BIT OF A PICKLE THAT THAT I DON'T. THEY SAID WHEN YOU GET A BENEFIT OUT HERE IN SUPPORT IT. BUT I'M NOT SURE. THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION OR THIS IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE DOING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALRIGHT WHY I THINK A WHOLE LOT HAS BEEN SAID MORE. HAS IT BEEN MOVED. SIR MOTION I MAKE A MOTION. THEY'RE JUST I TO JUST A QUICK COMMENT WAS JUST THERE AND I KNOW WE SPEND A LOT TIME ON THIS BUT THEM. THAT I I REALIZE THE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO LIKE CAME FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE PROBLEMATIC. WASTE FACILITY GREENWAYS AND WE'RE GONNA TALK NEXT ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO PERMIT MORE THOSE BUT A LOT OF WHAT CAME ABOUT THAT IS IN PRACTICE IN MANAGEMENT SO. ONE OF THE HOPES THAT I THINK HAVING THIS. TASK FORCE UP IN IN PLACE OF FOR YOU DOWN THERE. THIS INTERAGENCY STATE TASK FORCES GET THE PARTIES TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BE A MITCHELL IN MITCHELL EXISTENCE BECAUSE IT IS THERE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND IN THE. IN THE THERE IS A FOCUS ON. A CO EXISTENCE SO. MOTIONS BEEN MADE HAS HER SECOND. I'LL SECOND THE MOTION. MISTER CHIU. IT'S LIKE CLOTHES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AGAIN. IS A VERY UNIQUE SITUATION THIS MEDIA DIFFERENT BILL. VOTE WOULD TO HELP THE A WATER IS A DETRIMENT WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT. AND AND AND THAT AREA AND AND THE FACT THAT THE LAND OF MILPITAS THIS LOWERED AND THE WATER TREATMENT PLANT. WE HAVE A SLEW OF PUMP TO HELP TO PUMP TO GO TO WATER SO THERE'S SO LITTLE OF MANY MANY. OF US FORCES FORD FOR THE FOR THE OLDER AND TOM WERE WE'RE JUST HOPING THAT WE CAN GET. ALL THE STAKEHOLDER TOGETHER WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE FLOORS. AND DUMB YOU KNOW. REPRESENTING IN THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY. I HAVE A VERY OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE THAT WE CAN'T SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS AT THAT WOULD DEFINITELY BE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. M. MAKE. YOU KNOW ALL THOSE THE. AS A STAKEHOLDER ALL THOSE A ENTITY. BEING A CO EXIST WITH THREE X. THAT COULD EXIST IN. RESIDENT I DON'T AND I'M FROM CONTINUE TALKING WITH THE. DO WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT TO SEE THAT. THOUGH TWO IF THEY WILL. PUT ALL DID DRYING OFF THEIR SLUDGE IN THE ENCLOSED ENVIRONMENT AND AND. WOOD WORKING WITH A PLAN TO TO IMPLEMENT A SONG OFF THEIR. THOSE SOLVE THIS SUGGESTION DEAR SO IS THERE'S THERE'S THIS SPRING. OAK A GOOD RIGHT NOW AND I'M KINDA HOPEFUL LEADER. BE ABLE TO. GIVE SOME MORE PEACE TO DIS PASSPORTS WILL BE. ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH MORE. FOR THE LOCAL RESIDENTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. YEAH I I I DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BEING OF A PRECEDENT. BUT I'M GONNA RESPECT YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS IS THAT DISTRICT BELL AND I WAS SUPPORTING YOUR BILL. MADAM HER PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM SEVEN A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE BY MEMBER CHIU THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS THROUGHOUT TO IF YOU ARE ROUTES RICHIE I ACOSTA. NO A CUSTOM NO BLOOM.

NEXT BATTER UP. THIS IS THE AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THINKING COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS MEASURE. A AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE CALIFORNIA. THE CALIFORNIA GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT. REQUIRED THE STATE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO REDUCE THE STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. AND ENSURE THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BUT TO AT LEAST FORTY PERCENT BELOW THE NINETEEN NINETY LEVEL BY TWENTY THIRTY. ALTHOUGH THESE GOALS ARE ACHIEVABLE UNNECESSARY CALIFORNIA LACKS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET THIS DEMAND ACCORDING TO AN AIR RESOURCES BOARD PROPOSAL PUBLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE COORDINATING AND UTILIZING FUNDING SOURCES. HOW TO EXPAND CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WILL HELP ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOCATE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS? FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AND CLARIFY THAT ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING. APPROPRIATED BY THE LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE WASTE DIVERSION RECYCLING WILL INCLUDE. FOOD RESCUE WASTE PREVENTION AND ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING. TO MEET THESE GOALS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIGESTERS ARE COMPOSTING FACILITIES WILL NEED TO BE BELT WITHIN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. AB NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WILL PROVIDE FOR MUCH NEEDED FUNDING TO STRENGTHEN EXPAND AND REINFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOWING CALIFORNIA TO REDUCE ITS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND MEET ITS CLIMATE PROTECTION GOALS. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE BILL TODAY I HAVE WITH ME MOLESTA ROMERO FROM CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. THANK YOU TERRY MEMBERS MUSSER AMERO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE WE'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAIENSCHEIN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOCATE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND FOR COUNTER SICKLES PROGRAMS RECYCLING IN GENERAL IS A PROVEN AND COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION STRATEGY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO MEET MULTI. MULTIPLE POLICY OBJECTIVES AND SUPPORT ECONOMIC GROWTH CALLOUSLY GOES TO EUROPE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE BOTH INCREDIBLY COST EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND WE HOPE THAT FUNDING FOR TOWER CYCLES PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A PRIORITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. THE PROJECTS FUNDED UNDER COWER PSYCHOSES EUROPE GRANT PROGRAMS PROVIDE MEDICAL BENEFITS AND REALLY HELP TO FURTHER OUR WASTE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING GOALS. YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEFORE YOU GO FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO. LEAD EVERYONE THE OBVIOUS KNOW THAT NOT ONLY IS IT THAT MOTIONS BEEN MADE AND SECONDED BUT THIS THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. AND THAT THERE'S NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. YEAH.

AND IF CHAU TAK TAKE ISAAC CLOTHES THAT WOULD BE ALRIGHT. MOST OF MADE AND SECONDED THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS THE APPROPRIATIONS. ROLL CALL PLEASE. I AM ELEVEN AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SIX REMEMBER EGGMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS OUR EFFORT APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AYE MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTAHIGH FOSTER AYE BLOOM. BLOOM AYE CHAU. EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA I LIMON. MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ MELENDEZ AYE STONE. STONE I. EIGHT ZERO. PAGE ZERO BELLOWS OUT. NUMBER THIRTEEN MR BLOOM MAYBE THIRTEEN TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS SO LET ME START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AND THANKING STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. CLOTHING MADE FROM SYNTHETIC FABRICS DOMINATE CLOTHING INDUSTRY AND AS A RESULT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REGULARLY WASH CLOTHES MADE OF SYNTHETIC MATERIAL. SENSE IN FACT SIXTY PERCENT OF FABRIC PRODUCED IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONTAINED POLYESTER ON IT NO DOUBT IS ONLY GROWN SINCE THEN. NOW A OF WHY IS IS A PROBLEM. WILL LET'S USE POLYESTER FLEECE IS AN EXAMPLE EVERY TIME A FLEECE JACKET IS WASHED. IT RELEASES HUNDREDS PERHAPS THOUSANDS OF FIBERS INTO THE WATER AND THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC RELEASED BY THE LAUNDERING OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FLEECE JACKETS. IS EQUIVALENT TO UP TO. ELEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS ACCORDING TO A STUDY FROM THE UC SANTA BARBARA BRENT SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT. THIS IS A STUDY THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY PATAGONIA IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND STANDARD WASHING MACHINES DON'T HAVE FILTERS TO CATCH THESE FIBERS. AND SO ONCE THEY ESCAPE FROM OUR LAUNDRY AT THE TINY MOBILE THREADS WORK THEIR WAY INTO OUR WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS. AND THE SCREENING IN THOSE PLANTS IS TOO BIG TO CONTAIN THEM AND SO THEY GO OUT INTO THE OCEANS AND OUR WATER SUPPLY. OTHER POLYESTER FABRICS HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS AND IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN LOOKED AT THE GREAT LAKES ORIGINALLY FOR PLASTIC MICROBEADS CONTAMINATION. BUT FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF MICHAEL PLASTICS RELEASED BY TREATMENT PLANTS IN A WERE BEING RELEASED BY TREATMENT PLANTS INTO THE GREAT LAKES. TRIBUTARIES. AND OF THE MAJORITY OF THOSE MICRO PLASTICS ARE PLASTIC FIBERS FROM CLOTHING. RIGHT NOW IT'S ESTIMATED THAT SYNTHETIC FIBERS ARE BY COUNT THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTED A WATERSHED PLASTIC POLLUTION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF PLASTIC WASTE ENTERING THE OCEAN. WE DON'T KNOW YET THE EXTENT TO WHICH MICROPOLITAN POLLUTION MIGHT AFFECT HUMANS WE DO HOWEVER KNOW THAT MANY ANIMALS WITH THE IN. THE AQUATIC FOOD CHAIN INGEST THESE PLASTICS AND THE TOXICS THEY ABSORB FROM THE WATER AROUND THEM. AND THIS CAN TRANSFER TO THEIR TISSUE AND BECAUSE GOD IMPACTION HORMONE DISRUPTION AND LIVER DAMAGE MEANING WE ARE ALSO INGESTING PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS FROM THE FOOD WE EAT. AND THE WATER WE DRINK. UC DAVIS SAMPLED FISH AND SHELLFISH SOLD LOCAL CALIFORNIA FISH MARKETS AND FOUND ONE QUARTER OF THE FISH AND ONE THIRD OF THE SHELLFISH. CONTAIN PLASTIC DEBRIS. INTERNALLY. A MAJORITY OF THE PLASTIC DEBRIS FOUND IN FISH SAMPLES. WE'RE MICROFIBER. WELL ALL PLASTIC DEBRIS FOUND IN THE SHELLFISH SAMPLED WERE WITH MICROFIBER SO. WERE MICROFIBER. SIMILARLY A SURVEY COMPARED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TAP WATER SAMPLES FROM LOCATIONS IN FIVE DIFFERENT CONTINENTS. AND MICROPOLITAN FIBERS WERE FOUND IN NEARLY EVERY SAMPLE. THE SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES WATER SAMPLES CONTAIN PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS. ADDITIONALLY WE ARE STARTING TO FIND EVEN BOTTLED WATER CONTAMINATED WITH MICROFIBER IS. AND THERE ARE STUDIES THAT ARE. OF BEING RELEASED ON A REGULAR BASIS NOW THEY'RE SHOWING EVEN BROADER RELEASES A PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS BECAUSE WERE REALLY JUST STARTING TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS ISSUE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES THE CLOTHES. REAL SHOULD BEAR TWO LABELS ONE THAT ADDS INFORMATION ON THE EXISTING CARE LABEL AND A CAN. BANK ACCOUNT OR ANOTHER LABEL THAT INCLUDES INFORMATION REGARDING. HOW TO WASH AND HAVE CARE FOR THESE PRODUCTS? THE LABEL WILL NOT REQUIRE A MANUFACTURER TO INCLUDE ANY INFORMATION THAT WOULD BE IN CONFLICT WITH WHAT IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. AND AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE I SHOULD POINT OUT IS NOT A BAN. IT'S SIMPLY AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP THAT HOLDS COUNTIES THE COMPANIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE WASTE THAT THEIR PRODUCTS CREATE. THAT EDUCATES THE PUBLIC AND THAT KEEPS THE PRESSURE ON MANUFACTURERS TO FIND WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE AND THAT IS A LASTING SOLUTION. SO. THIS IS A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO TACKLING A COMPLICATED ISSUE. AND I LEAVE YOU WITH THIS. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE. TWO THIRDS OF THE PLAT OF THE MICRO PLASTIC RELEASED INTO THE WORLD'S OCEANS. ARE DUE TO THE WASHING OF SYNTHETIC TEXTILES. AND IF WE WAIT TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IT WILL ONLY GET WORSE. WE THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE WHERE WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE POLLUTION AT THE SOURCE. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE EMPOWERS CONSUMER WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO HELP THEM TAKE RESPONSIBLE ACTION AS INDIVIDUALS I HAVE THREE WITNESSES WITH ME HERE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL OF THEM TO INTRODUCE THEMSELVES. AND I THANK YOU FOR AND I VOTE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MARTUCCI HONORABLE MEMBERS I AM SHALL BE CHAU TRAY REPRESENTING THE BREAK FREE FROM PLASTIC GLOBAL MOVEMENT. WE REPRESENT ELEVEN HUNDRED NGOS WORKING ACROSS THE GLOBE THAT ARE COMMITTED TO STOPPING PLASTIC POLLUTION FROM EXTRACTION TO DISPOSAL. THE MOVEMENT IS INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THE THREAT OF MICRO PLASTIC POLLUTION MICROFIBER IS ARE KNOWN TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR WATERWAYS. THEY ARE IN THE FOOD WE EAT THE AIR WE BREATHE. AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. WE KNOW FROM STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY ITSELF THAT SYNTHETIC FIBERS SHAD PERSISTENT MATERIALS INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT. INDUSTRY ALSO ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. THE MOVEMENT FEELS VERY SIR UP STRONGLY ABOUT. CITIZENS SHOULD BE INFORMED THAT THE CLOTHING THEY BUY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO POLLUTE OUR ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRST STEP IS KNOWLEDGE AB TWO THREE SEVEN NINE DOES JUST THAT. SOME OF PROPOSED THAT WE FILTER WASHING MACHINE AFFLUENT. THERE ARE A HUNDRED IN THREE MILLION WASHING MACHINES IN THE U. S. THE SIMPLY WILL NOT WORK. THE DISCUSSION SHOULD NOT BE HOW MUCH OR HOW LITTLE A GIVEN FABRIC FLUTES IT SHOULD BE ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT. ON BEHALF OF THE BREAK FREE FROM PLASTIC GLOBAL MOVEMENT. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ON AB TWO THREE SEVEN NINE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JUST AGOG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES WE REPRESENT ALL THE MAJOR WASTE WATER TREATMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. A MICROFIBER AND MAKE A PLASTIC POLLUTION IS A SUBJECT THAT'S BEEN GENERATING. SOME SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC INTEREST LATELY AND OUR MEMBERS ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION. AND VARIOUS RESEARCH EFFORTS RELATING TO MICRO PLASTICS HAVE BEEN INDUCED INITIATED IN RECENT YEARS INCLUDING. SOME BEING DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WASTE WATER COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS FOR MICRO FIBERS TO ENTER THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WASHING MACHINE AFFLUENT IS. A CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE SOURCE. OF TREATMENT PLANTS ARE JUST NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO FILTER OUT MICRO FIBERS AND IN CASES WHERE. THEY CAN FILTER FOR MICRO FIBERS AND THEY REALLY ARE JUST BEING TRANSFERRED TO ADDRESS A DIFFERENT WASTE STREAM THOUGH THEY STILL TIMIDLY AND UP IN THE ENVIRONMENT. SO FOR THESE REASONS AND WE'VE BEEN ACTIVELY ADVOCATING FOR SOURCE CONTROL AS. THE BEST SOLUTION FOR DEALING WITH. MAKER PLASTIC POLLUTION AND WE THINK AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE PROMOTE SOURCE CONTROL AND CONSUMER AWARENESS OF THE ISSUE. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD URGE YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN OR ITS ITCHY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CRAIG CADWALLADER AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION AND. I AGREE WITH ALL THE STATEMENTS MADE PREVIOUS TO US WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED WITH PLASTIC CENTER IN ARENA OUR ENVIRONMENT AND WE. THINK THE CORRECT APPROACH TO THIS IS TO CONTROL IT AT THAT SOURCE. AND. IF ANYONE'S IT YOU KNOW THAT MY EXPERIENCE WITH DOING WELL WATCHING OF THE. FABRICS IS YOU KNOW STUFF IS GOING DOWN THE DRAIN BUT. YOU CAN TELL BY WHAT'S LEFT OVER THAT SEE IN THE LENT TRAPPED IN YOUR DRYER. SO THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE AMOUNT OF. FIBERS THAT ARE GETTING OUT INTO THE ENVIRONMENT WE WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD HELP EDUCATE THE CONSUMERS AND. CREATE A BETTER AWARENESS OF THIS ISSUE MANY. FOLKS ARE NOT AWARE OF THE ISSUE OF LE MICRO FIBERS AND THAT IT'S GETTING INTO OUR ENVIRONMENT IT'S GETTING INTO WILDLIFE. AND GETTING INTO US AND AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IT'S AN TAP WATER IT'S IN BOTTLED WATER IT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BASICALLY JUST VIRTUALLY EVERYWHERE SO WE WOULD HOPE THAT. NO. WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS MATTER AND HOPE THAT WE COULD HELP EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND BRING THEM ON. AS. A POTENTIAL SOURCE TO HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU MELISSA ROMERO THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND JUST WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK ON THIS ISSUE. GENEVIEVE AVEDON ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION A COALITION OF ELEVEN ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SURFRIDER AND HEAL THE BAY. WHO ARE DEDICATED KEEPING PLASTIC POLLUTION OUT OF OUR WATERWAYS AND OCEANS AND STRONG SUPPORT AND I WAS ASKED BY TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND TO? SEND THEIR SUPPORT AS WELL THINKING. TERESA BURKETT PITCH ON BEHALF OF HARD I'LL IN OYSTER FRIENDS. I JUST WHEN DAD DIED THESE MICRO FIBERS. JEOPARDIZE A. INDUSTRY THAT CONTRIBUTES TWENTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND BECAUSE OF THIS WE ARE IN SUPPORT. AND ONLY SERVER O. DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE AND WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. ONE OF THE MEAT ON ON BEHALF OF LAWSUIT TRANSIT STRUCK SUPPORT. DOW JONES WAS THERE COULD CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. I MEAN TO OUR BEHALF ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA WE ALSO SUPPORT THINKING. I MISTER JAY WILL SEN. PROUD CO SPONSOR OF FROM THE STORY OF STUFF PROJECT IN STRONG SUPPORT THANKS. JENNIFER WILLIAMS WITH EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT ALSO IN SUPPORT. JUSTIN LONG FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY IN SUPPORT. ALRIGHT. OPPOSITION. WITNESSES. AFTERNOON WHICH CARE MARGARET LATCHING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE UP CHADLI IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S CONCERN. AND THE ATTENTION HE'S PROPOSITIONS. WE DON'T SEE MANDATORY HANDWASHING LABELS AS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FIRST AND FOREMOST WE THINK THAT CONSUMERS WILL LARGELY IGNORED THIS ADVICE. BUSY WORKING FAMILIES ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE TIME TO HAND WASH THEIR CHILDREN'S CLOTHES THEIR WORK OUT WHERE. WERE. THEIR UNIFORMS THAT THEY NEED TO GO TO WORK PERHAPS AND MEDICAL ENVIRONMENT OR SOME OTHER PLACE WE JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S A REALISTIC SOLUTION. OF THIS COMMITTEE JUST SPENT A FEW MINUTES DISCUSSING AN ODOR PROBLEM WE THINK THIS MIGHT CREATE ANOTHER ODOR PROBLEM IF EVERYBODY WERE ACTUALLY HAND WASHING. I WOULD ALSO ARGUE THAT. FROM AN ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE HE AND WASHING ACTUALLY UTILIZES MORE WATER AND OBVIOUSLY THIS COMMITTEE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME ENERGY AND EFFORT FOCUSING ON THE NEED TO PRESERVE WATER AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO. MANY PARTS OF THE STATE SO WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE SOLUTION FOR THAT REASON ALSO. I CALIFORNIA OVER ONLY LABEL WILL DEFINITELY INCREASE COSTS FOR MANUFACTURING. BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE TO DO A CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC LABEL ON THAT IN TURN WILL INCREASE THE COST FOR FOR RETAILERS AND FOR CONSUMERS WHO OFTEN CHOOSE SYNTHETIC PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN WOOL SILK OR COTTON AND THE CARE IS ACTUALLY EASIER TO RETHINK THAT'S ANOTHER BURDEN ON CONSUMERS THAT THIS BILL PLACES. FINALLY WE THINK THIS BILL IS PREMATURE THE AUTHOR DID STATE ONE STUDY FROM THE BURNS SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES AT YOU SEE S. B. BUT WE ALSO KNOW OF ANOTHER AND THE. DAY THAT BROWN SCHOOL AND OCEAN CONSERVANCY ESTABLISHED A MICROFIBER LEADERSHIP SUMMIT LAST OCTOBER THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF. KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE APPROPRIATE WHAT THE REAL SOURCES OF MICROFIBER POLLUTION ARE THEY POINTED TO TOILETRIES WHICH IS COMMITTEE HAS. ADDRESSED TO SOME EXTENT. UPHOLSTERY CARPETING AND OTHER CONTRIBUTORS AS PART OF THE PROBLEM AND THEY ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THE SOLUTION. IS NOT KNOWN AT THIS TIME BUT THEY'RE WORKING ON IDENTIFYING THE SOLUTION AND MAKING SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS. SO WE CURRENTLY DON'T THINK THAT HAND WASHING IS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION AND. THE LABELING PUTS A GREAT DEAL OF BURDEN. AND LIABILITY ON CALIFORNIA RETAILER SO FOR THAT REASON WE MUST OPPOSE. THANK YOU FOR PUTTING US OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BILL TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE MY NAME IS KRISTEN CURRENT I'M A GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE AMERICAN APPAREL FOOTWEAR ASSOCIATION WE'RE A TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING APPAREL AND FOOTWEAR TRAVEL GOODS AND OTHER SEWN PRODUCTS COMPANIES. I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS STATEMENTS AND I JUST WANNA ADD ON LABELING AS A SOLUTION. INDUSTRIES CURRENTLY ENGAGING ON THIS ISSUE AND. WE DON'T DISAGREE THAT MICROFIBER POLLUTION. DOES EXIST AND IS AN ISSUE IN THIS COMMUNITY BUT WE. WANT TO SPEAK TO LABELING. IS NOT THE SOLUTION IN THIS CASE. GARMENTS CONVEY AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION ALREADY PER FEDERAL LAW. ON FIBER CONTENT CARE INSTRUCTIONS COUNTRY OF ORIGIN AND NUMBER OF OTHER PIECES OF INFORMATION SO. FURTHER LABELING IN THIS CASE IS IT'S JUST REDUNDANT. AND REALLY WOULD BE LOST IN THE INFORMATION THAT IT'S ALREADY MANDATED ON THOSE LABELS SO AT BEST CONSUMERS WOULD SIMPLY IGNORE THE INFORMATION ON THE LABEL AND AT WORST IT WOULD CAUSE CONFUSION OR HARM IF CONSUMERS AND IT UP CARING FOR THEIR GARMENTS IN A WAY THAT DAMAGED THEIR. CLOTHING. MOREOVER BECAUSE FEDERAL CARE INSTRUCTIONS EXPLICITLY REQUIRE THE PROVISION OF THE BEST METHOD OF REFERS BANISHMENT OF A GOVERNMENT. THAT AVOID DAMAGE TO THE GOVERNMENT A STATE BASED CARE INSTRUCTION THAT LED TO THIS OUTCOME. WOULD CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL LAW AND FILL ON FEDERAL PREEMPTION GROUNDS SO ADDITIONALLY WITHOUT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON SOLUTIONS TO MICRO FIBER POLLUTION A PRESCRIBED LABEL OR SIMILAR REGULATORY OUTCOME. WOULDN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM AND AN ABSENCE OF THIS DATA THE MANDATED LABELING ALMOST SURELY FAILS THEM COMPELLED SPEECH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FIRST ON CAP KEY MCCUE CAPTAINED ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO REGRETFULLY OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. ULTIMATELY I SEEM CA REALLY CLEARLY. NOTES THAT THE REAL QUESTION IS WHETHER REQUIRING A LABEL ON THE SYNTHETIC FABRICS I AM ULTIMATELY IS A REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING MICROFIBER IS ENTERING. INTO AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT AND WHETHER CONSUMERS WILL OF ACTUALLY ABIDE BY LABELS TO THAT AND. RELATIVE TO THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR THAT MANY CONSUMERS ARE REALLY FAST FOCUSED ON FOR THEIR BUSY LIVES. NOTABLY VIRTUALLY ALL FABRIC SYNTHETIC OR NATIONAL TO SHED IN SOME LEVEL AND THE APPROACH ADDRESSING MICRO FIBERS IN TRAINING ENVIRONMENT AS PROPOSED BY AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. IS NOT WITHOUT ITS TRADE OFFS AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY PRIOR I'D HA OPPONENT COLLEAGUES RELATIVE TO HAND WASHING. NOT SPECIFICALLY ELIMINATING MICRO FIBERS IN LAW THE WATERWAYS NOT TO MENTION ABOUT TIED THE ISSUES AROUND WATER EFFICIENCY AND THE FACT THAT MACHINE WASHING IS ACTUALLY MUCH MORE EFFICIENT WHEN IT COMES TO. A WASHINGTON ARTICLES OF CLOTHING FOR WATER I HAD EFFICIENCY PURPOSES ON AND AS WAS NOTED BRIEFLY AYE RELATIVE TO CONCERNS ABOUT. A PROFESSIONALS LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO WEAR UNIFORMS THAT ARE MADE A VERY DURABLE SYNTHETIC FABRICS AND THE CONCERN ABOUT WHETHER HAND WASHING IS SUFFICIENT TO REMOVE. THOSE AYE SOILED AYE INCOME AND ARE PIECES OF FABRIC FURTHER FOR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WHETHER THAT SUFFICIENT IN HAND WASHING TO SUFFICIENTLY SANITIZE THOSE ARTICLES OF CLOTHING AS WELL IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS. AND FINALLY IN IN THE INTEREST OF SUSTAINABILITY AND CRADLE TO CRADLE PRACTICES MANY CLOTHING MANUFACTURERS ARE USING UTILIZING MORE AND MORE RECYCLED FABRICS LIKE POLYESTER IN THEIR CLOSING CLOTHING MANUFACTURING. SUCH EFFORTS FROM C. MTA'S PERSPECTIVE SHOULD BE LAUDED NOT CONSTRICTED WITH ADDITIONAL BURDENS AND BACKLASH AS LIKE LABELING REQUIREMENTS ON MANUFACTURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL NOT SERVE THE INTENDED AND AND. PURPOSE OF THE BILL SO FOR THESE REASONS UNFORTUNATELY WE DO OPPOSE AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE US SO I TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES BEING DEVELOPED. OTHER WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE SITUATION AND AND HELP US GET US FURTHER ALONG IN TERMS OF MICHAEL FIBERS IN THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THESE REASONS WERE POSTING HERE. ALRIGHT THANK YOU BEFORE WE. GET TO MS EDMUNDS QUESTION IF WE CAN JUST OKAY. FOR THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MADISON Y. ON BEHALF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. ADAM RIGHTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. CHAIR MEMBERS JOE ACT LEARNED BEHALF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION THOSE. ALRIGHT MS EGGMAN. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION BLOOM FOR FOR THIS BILL. I'M I'VE BEEN CALLING A DELIBERATE AGAINST BILL. WHERE THAT WE ONLY HAVE NATURAL FIBERS? SO AYE SO YOU AND I AND MR STONE AND MISS MELINDA'S I THINK WERE SOME OF THE FIRST PEOPLE WHO GOT HERE IN THIS THIS NEW CLASS OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND IF THERE'S ONE THING WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF TIMES IT'S THINGS ON SCOPE. AND THINGS ON LABELING REPEATEDLY. I THINK ARTIE SHAW I WON'T BE ABLE SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY FOR THAT ONE OF THOSE VERY RECENT ONE I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT THE DATA YET. I THINK IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. I REPRESENT WITH A VERY POOR ECONOMY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN AFFORD. PURE SILK PURE COTTON OR PURE. WALL ME SO THAT'S AN ISSUE. SO THEM WERE ALSO TELLING PEOPLE IS WHAT WE PUT ON THE LABELS DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE WE VERY. VERY CAREFUL BUT WE PUT ON LABELS AND WHEN WE PUT SOMETHING ON LABELS. WE'RE BASICALLY TELLING PEOPLE TO HAND OR SOMETHING AND WE KNOW THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BECAUSE SOMEDAY WITH BY PIDS. IS NED POTTER DOESN'T HAVE THE SPACE TO BUILD A HAND WASH EVERYBODY'S CLOTHES. ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE. AND THEN FINALLY ASSEMBLY WHO REPRESENTS THE DELTA AREA AND AS WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH NOT HAVING ENOUGH WATER. AND UC SANTA BARBARA STUDY CLEARLY SAYS WASHING THINGS BY HAND TAKES A LOT MORE WATER THAN THE WASHING MACHINES SO I THINK YOU'RE ON TO SOMETHING REALLY INTERESTING. BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT WHITE BOY I DON'T THINK I KNOW I'M NOT THERE YET. TOM KNOWS WE BEFORE IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE SOLUTIONS THAT YOU COME UP WITH THANK YOU. NEAR THERE A. COMMENTS MUSLIM THANK YOU. I THINK YOU I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I TOO AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE BRAND SCHOOL ON THE WORK THAT THE DEAL. AND AND A LITTLE SLIGHTLY TRUST ACTUALLY WASH A LOT OF THINGS AND HAND WASH. BECAUSE THE LABEL SAYS TO AND SO I PAY ATTENTION TO THE LABEL. AND IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME AND I THINK MY CONCERN IS THE IS THE LONG TERM. AND THE A OF AND KNOWING THAT IT'S NOT AS WATER EFFICIENT THAT TOO. AT WASH THINGS BY HAND BUT I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT THIS. IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OUR WATER SOURCES. AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO S. SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. I AGES. I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE BRANDS REPORT AND STUDY IS SOMETHING THAT I IS. INTERESTING TO ME IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO YOU AND I'M TRYING TO GRAPPLE BETWEEN THE INTERSECTION OF DOING WHAT'S RIGHT. YOU KNOW FOR THE WATER IN TAKING THESE MEGA FARMERS OUT OR REDUCING NOT TAKEN OUT REDUCING THEM I'M FROM GOING INTO THE WATER WHILE AT THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ONE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW. IS NOT. IT HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF I'M. IMPACT ON THE NEED LIKE TO SEE IT BUT I DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO AFFORD. MR ACOSTA. THANK YOU UP TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND IN WITH ALL RESPECT I WILL BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL EITHER A BUT I I THINK. MUCH ALONG THE SAME LINES. HE AYE AYE AND REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. THE NARRATIVE IN HERE IN THE COMMENTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW KIND OF FRIGHTENING IN ORDER WERE ALL JESSE PLASTICS ALL THE SAME I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. AND EVEN IF I AGREE WITH THAT. I'M JUST NOT SURE OF HOW PRACTICAL. THIS IS GOING TO BE ON A DAILY THEY BASIS FOR. THE YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE. YOU KNOW THE WORKING FAMILY COMMUTERS IN MY DISTRICT WHO RUSH HOME FROM SOCCER PRACTICE AND BOTH PARENTS WORKING AND RUN AND. AND I JUST. AS AN ASIDE ARE. THIRTY YEAR OLD. SUPER DEPENDABLE TOP LOADING. ONE NAME THE BRAND BUT IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. FINALLY DIED TOP LOADING WASHING MACHINE AND I WENT OUT AND AND I'M LOOKING IT CAN GET ALL THESE REPORTS AND RATINGS AND. YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALL A JILLION DOLLARS RIGHT AND I ENDED UP WITH THIS VERY. CAN HIGH AND ON SALE. PRETTY IN A GOOD WITH THAT. WELL A VERY ENERGY EFFICIENT AND VERY LOW WATER USAGE WHAT TOP LOADING WASHING MACHINE I MEAN IT USES LIKE THIS MUCH WATER AND WATER FALLS IN ALL THIS GREAT STUFF. AND YOU DON'T EVEN THINK IT'S WORKING. UNTIL YEAR CLOSE OUT BECAUSE YOU CAN HEAR IT IN ITS TURN ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF. AND HAS A HAND WASHING FUNCTION ON THEIR. AND THAT AND I THINK I WONDER FREELY CONFUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH NO HAND WASH ONLY GONNA PUSH THE HAND WASHING BUT AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CUTE I I JUST. DON'T SEE PEOPLE BRING IT THE BEING THAT PRACTICAL ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS. THE PRACTICAL SIDE OF THINGS IS IS IT GONNA RUN AFOUL OF FEDERAL LAW AND I AND I REALLY AM CONCERNED WITH IT LIVING IN AN AREA AS WE DO IT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE WATER EVEN IF WE DID IT. I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE ALL RESPECT I I THINK. TO THEM. HIT ME ASSEMBLYMEMBER. EGGMAN'S POINT HERE ON THE SOMETHING I JUST THINK WE NEED TO FLUSH A SUBTLE ABOUT MORBID BUT THANK YOU FOR BERGEN THE BILL. SO MISTER BLOOM BY. APPRECIATE. YOUR GOAL OF OF OF YOUR BILL I MEAN CLEARLY PLUS THE POLLUTION IS A CRISIS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU RAISE THE IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT HOW THESE MICRO FIBERS ARE ENDING UP IN OUR WATER SUPPLY IN OUR FOOD SUPPLY. AND. THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO BE EDUCATED I HAD TO BE EDUCATED. ABOUT THE. MEGA FIBERS AND DATA AND EXTENT OF THE PROBLEM AND SO. I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL I WILL BE SUPPORTING A BILL. AND. YES WHICH LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN A COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR. COMMENTS. A THIS IS CLEARLY A PROBLEM STUDIES ARE A CONSISTENT IN IDENTIFYING PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS IN THE WATER SUPPLY AS A AS A PROBLEM. IT'S A PROBLEM THAT'S GOING TO BE COME CRISIS IF IT GOES UNADDRESSED. AND. WE ARE SIMPLY TALKING ABOUT LABELS HERE AND PIECES OF PAPER THAT WILL INFORM THE PUBLIC ABOUT AN ISSUE AND GIVE THEM OPTIONS. DOESN'T MANDATE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING. I. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT. HOW OFTEN WE WASH CLOTHES WELL AND AND DEREK AND USING TOO MUCH WATER THAT'S A PERFECTLY GOOD EXAMPLE BECAUSE I THINK IN MANY INSTANCES WE PROBABLY ALREADY WASHED THINGS TOO FREQUENTLY? MANY OF THE FLEECE GARMENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR OUTER GARMENTS THAT AT LEAST IN MY EXPERIENCE AND I DON'T SMELL RELEASED I HAVEN'T HAD COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT. UP I DON'T I DON'T WASH THEM EVERY TIME I I WEAR THEM. I WEAR A JACKET I TAKE IT OFF I HANG IT IN THE CLOSET AND I YOU KNOW EVERY FEW WARING'S THAT'S WHEN IT GETS WASHED. OF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW ABOUT. AND NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO ADAPT OUR BEHAVIOR TO THE REALITY OF THIS KIND OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. OF THERE'S A LOT MORE WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT ON THIS ISSUE AND IT IS A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO MOVE FORWARD IT NEEDS TO BE HELD PUBLICLY I THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCUSS IT HERE THIS EVENING BUT I KNOW THE HOURS RUNNING LATE AND SO I WILL SIMPLY. RESPECTFULLY ASK DERIVA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ROLL CALL PLEASE. WELL ACTUALLY I. IS OUR MOTION FOR. THE BILL.

WHETHER SCIENTISTS HAVE WARNED THAT THE INCREASED FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF LARGE WILDFIRES IS DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. EXCESSIVE WILDFIRES DESTROYS HOMES EXPOSES SLOPES TO EROSION AND LAND LANDSLIDES THREATENS PUBLIC HEALTH AND CAUSES ECONOMIC DOC DAMAGE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX DIRECTS CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE THE SCALE AND PACE OF FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES TO ENSURE THOSE ACTIVITIES HAPPEN YEAR ROUND THE BILL ALSO RE ESTABLISHES A FIRE PREVENTION WORKING GROUP. AND CREATE A ROBUST YEAR ROUND FIRE PREVENTION LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANT PROGRAM AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX IS NEEDED TO RE ORIENT CALIFORNIA TO THE REALITY OF THE YEAR ROUND FIRE SEASON AND TO MAKE TARGETED INVESTMENTS INTO LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT PLAY A KEY ROLE IN PREVENTING FUTURE FIRES SINCE. I'M FROM THE NATURE CONSERVANCY THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT TO AND THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TERRY HEARTY AND THE ACTING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE LITTLE COOPER COMMISSION A BIPARTISAN GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT AGENCY THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS CRITICAL TOPIC. IN FEBRUARY ARE COMMISSION ISSUED A REPORT CALLING FOR THE DRAMATIC CULTURE CHANGE IN THE WAY FORESTS ARE MANAGED IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR AIR. OUR WATER AND COOK THE CATASTROPHIC CYCLE OF DEVASTATING WILD WILD FIRES AND TREAT DEATHS. OUR REPORT THINKS NINE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THE NEED FOR COLLABORATION. UTILIZING PRESCRIBED FIRE. DEALING WITH DEAD TREES IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND EDUCATING PUBLIC REPUBLICAN WHY FORCE MATTER. DURING OUR SITE VISITS WE'VE LEARNED THAT A REGIONAL APPROACH WAS REALLY IMPORTANT ALONG WITH STATE AND FEDERAL APPROACHES. AND WE ALSO SAW THAT EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WAS REALLY IMPORTANT IN ORDER.

INTO DOESN'T SEVENTEEN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE THE WORST WILDFIRES IN ITS HISTORY. WITH THE TRAGIC LOSS OF LIFE AND DEVASTATION TO COMMUNITIES IT WAS ALSO THE MOST EXPENSIVE FIRE SEASON YET. WILDFIRES CONTINUE TO GET LARGER HOTTER AND MORE DESTRUCTIVE THREATENING NOT ONLY LIVES IN COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO SERIOUSLY DAMAGING AIR QUALITY. WATER QUALITY AND RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES WHAT THE SAME TIME RELEASING ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GASES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO INCREASE FIRE PREVENTION. WHEN FIRE PREVENTION WORK IS PUT ON HOLD THE RISK OF MADE UP BUYERS INCREASES AND ONE MEGA FIRES HAPPENED MORE MONEY MUST BE SPENT TO FIGHT THEM CREATING A VICIOUS CYCLE. AB NINETEEN FIFTY SIX DIRECTS CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES AND SURE THEY HAVE BEEN YOUR ROUTE. FIRE PREVENTION OF THE BILL. BECAUSE TO BE.

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN VERS THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT EMPOWERS THE COMMISSION TO PROTECT MAINTAIN WERE FEASIBLE ENHANCE AND RESTORE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE COASTAL ZONE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL RESOURCES. IN LINE WITH THAT MISSION ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW THE STATES TO COASTAL MANAGEMENT AGENCIES TO PROVIDE CRITICAL TECHNICAL JURISDICTIONAL AND RESOURCE ASSESSMENT ASSISTANCE TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. PROCESS IN THE EVENT OF AN OIL SPILL. BRINGING THE COMMISSION'S EXPERTISE TO BEAR WOULD ENSURE THAT DAMAGES CAUSED BY OIL SPILLS ARE EVALUATED RECOVERED AND RESTORED TO THEIR FULLEST POTENTIAL. IT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT STREAMLINING APPROVALS FOR COASTAL MITIGATION PROJECTS. THE RECENTLY PROPOSED FEDERAL PLAN TAKES AN OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST STRENGTHENS THE CASE FOR INCLUDING THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION IS FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY HAVE LED TO IT IT HAVE LED IT TO BECOME THE STATE EXPERTS ON EVALUATING AND QUANTIFYING COASTAL NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGES AND RESTORATION. I WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND AMENDED AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY FOUR. THE CONSULTATION ROLE PAPA THAT PROPOSED BY THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO CONTRIBUTE ITS PARTICULAR EXPERTISE TO AN RDA. IN A WAY THAT SUPPLEMENTS BUT DOES NOT SUPPLANT THE ESTABLISHED PROCESS I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION AS THE BILL PROGRESSES. TODAY I HAVE I'M WITH ME AND SOME SUPPORTERS AND I WHO WILL TESTIFY. ON BEHALF OF THE BILL. GOOD EVENING PILE JONES A CIRCLE CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT TODAY. AS WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY IF WE ARE CONTINUING TO PRODUCE OF OFFSHORE OIL RESOURCES THERE WILL BE ACCIDENTS THERE WILL BE MORE SPELLS UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S JUST THE TRUTH AND WE'RE FACING REALITY WHERE THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO INCREASE THIS DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THE WISHES OF THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS I AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT IF THERE ARE FOR FUTURE SPILLS THAT. THAT THAT WE COMPLETELY HOLD. FOLKS RESPONSIBLE ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT THEY MITIGATE THEIR ACTIONS. AND AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES BY ALLOWING FOR THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND THE BEAT THAT. THE CDC. TO PARTICIPATE IN THE. NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WERE REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THOSE AGENCIES WHO KNOW PASSED THE COAST AND IT'S COASTAL RESOURCES ARE THERE TO ACCOUNT FOR. OUT WHAT RESOURCES BEEN DAMAGED FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATH FORWARD TO. RESTORE WHAT WE CAN RESTORE AND REALLY HOLD THOSE ACCOUNTABLE AYE IT'S IMPORTANT IN THIS FUTURE THAT WE HAVE MOVE THIS BILL FOR TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS OF SIR CHRISSY LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THECALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. I WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT THE COMMISSION HASN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE AN OFFICIAL POSITION YET ON THE AMENDED BILL. BUT THEY DO HAVE A STAFF ANALYSIS IN FRONT OF THEM RECOMMENDING A SUPPORT POSITION AND THEY WILL BE VOTING ON THAT BILL LATER THIS WEEK SO I'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO COME AND TESTIFY THIS COMMITTEE TODAY BASED ON THE. THE REASONS FOR THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL WAS ONE OF THE IMPETUS REASONS FOR THE COASTAL ACT BEING PASSED. AND SINCE THAT TIME. SINCE THE PASSED THE ACT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO PRESERVING AND PROTECTING COASTAL RESOURCES AND OUR OCEAN. THERE HAVE BEEN EIGHTEEN OIL SPILL SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE FOR WHICH THE STATE HAS PREPARED A NATURAL RESOURCES DAMAGE ASSESSMENT. FOR REASONS NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR TO US THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY OF THOSE AND RDAS. HOWEVER. WE THINK THIS BILL OFFERS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMMISSION TO BRING SOME ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE AND PERSPECTIVE TO THE PROCESS WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE OF THE OF THE OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE AND DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES. PARTICIPATING AND RDAS IT'S BEEN A STEEP LEARNING CURVE FOR US LEARNING WHAT GOES INTO. ONE OF THESE PLANS BUT WE'RE GAME TO PARTICIPATE AND TO HELP PROTECT A CALIFORNIA'S COAST IN OCEAN RESOURCES I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU. HELLO JENNIFER SAVAGE FROM THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION WE HAVE DUBBED EIGHTY CHAPTERS IN THE COUNTRY AND WE HAVE TWENTY CHAPTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE LONG BEEN DEDICATED TO HELP THE BEACHES AND CLEAN WATER. WE'VE BEEN ON THE GROUND THE NUMBER OF OIL SPILLS IT HAPPENED OF INDIANA COAST UNFORTUNATELY SO OUR MEMBERSHIP IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE. THREATS AND THE CONSEQUENCES THAT HAPPEN AS MY COLLEAGUE ACCOUNT THAT FROM THE SIERRA CLUB. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF IF IT'S A QUESTION OF WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE MORE OIL SPILLS. WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW THERE IS. AND ATTEMPT TO EXPAND OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING AND EVEN IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA FOR THEIR RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND THE ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE THAT WE HAVE ON OUR COAST. DESERVE THE MOST PROTECTION THIS BILL WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC. IS ABLE TO BE PROTECTED IN THE WAY THAT THEY DID DESERVE AND THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MEMBERS GOOD EVENING OUTFITS APF A THOMAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM SOLUTION. WHEN WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MEMBERS OFFICE WE WERE INFORMED THAT. ONLY MADE THE SUGGESTION THAT THE COAST COMMISSION BE. AN ADVISORY CAPACITY. THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE AND THAT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHORS OFFICE. UNFORTUNATELY. WHEN THE AMENDMENT CAME OUT IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY LOOK LIKE BUT WE HAVE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY. SO LET ME BE CLEAR WE AGREE THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE AN ADVISORY POSITION DO WE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE IN STATURE THAT THEIR OPINION SHOULD WEIGH MORE THAN OTHERS NOW. DO WE BELIEVE THAT THEIR OPINION IN FACT SHOULD COME OUT WAY HOSPERS NO. BUT SHOULD BE UNDER ADVISEMENT YES WE BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BE UNDER ADVISEMENT BUT THE PLACEMENT STATUTE INDIAN PROVIDE THEM WITH A LITTLE MORE. AS YOU MAY SAY SWAY THAN OTHER. ENTITIES THAT ARE ACTUALLY TASK TO DO THIS ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS WE DISAGREE SO WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AS AMENDED AGAIN FROM THE STANDPOINT MEMBERS OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION BEING IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY.

AND THIS IS A SIMPLE STREAMLINING BILL WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION DOES. LAND EXCHANGES WE HAD AN EXAMPLE THIS ON OUR AGENDA TODAY THERE WAS A LAND EXCHANGE THAT PASSED THROUGH ON. CONSENT. INSTEAD OF BRINGING ALL OF THESE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AS IS THE CURRENT PRACTICE IT JUST SEEMS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TO LATE GIVEAWAY AND COMMISSION AUTHORITY TO DO THESE CONVEYANCES. AS LONG AS WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS TRANSPARENT AND THAT THEY ARE REPORTING THESE CONVEYANCES SO THAT. THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING AND WHERE THE CONVEYANCE ARE THIS IS A NORMAL PART OF THEIR. THEIR BUSINESS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTES AND I DO HAVE JERRY PEMBERTON WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. AS A WITNESS. THANK YOU SHERRY PEMBERTON ON BEHALF FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION HAS SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION IT IS AS I THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID OVERLY SIMPLE STRAIGHT FORWARD BELL TO. MAKE OUR LAND EXCHANGE PROCESSES MORE EFFICIENT AS SAVE MONEY AND RESOURCES THE COMMISSION DOES LAND EXCHANGES FROM TIME TO TIME AND IT'S. A LENGTHY CUMBERSOME PROCESS WITH A LOT OF LEVELS OF SCRUTINY SO THAT FINAL STEP OF GRANTING THE LAND THAT THE STATE. TAKES INTO THE TRUST BACK TO A LOCAL JURISDICTION IS. FAIRLY MINISTERIAL AND SO THIS BILL WILL HELP US DO THAT A MORE EFFICIENTLY. MOVE THE BILL. OPPOSITION. THE MOVE THE SECOND INNING COMEBACK. I ASK HER ABOUT.

AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY NINE HAD THIS IS A SIMPLE MEASURE THAT WOULD REQUIRE SINGLE USE PLASTIC BEVERAGE CONTAINERS TAP TEIR CAPS TETHERED. THIS COMMITTEE SAW. THE BILL IN JANUARY AND PASS OUT OF THIS. COMMITTEE AT THE ONE CHANGE IN THIS BILL IS THAT WE HAVE IN FACT REMOVED THE DATE THAT WAS A POINT OF CONTENTION. WITH UP. THAT THE CASE FOR THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY CLEAR AND WAS MADE LAST JANUARY THAT BOTTLE CAPS ARE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. THERE CONSISTENTLY AMONG THE TOP FIVE CURRENTLY THE TOP THREE MOST UBIQUITOUS ITEM THAT IS FOUND IN CLEAN UP SEN THROUGHOUT THE ENVIRONMENT. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE EFFORTS TO RE ASK THAT. BOTTLES COME BACK WITH THE CAPS STILL NOT WORKING. AT BY THE EVIDENCE OF HOW MANY BOTTLE CAPS ARE FOUND OUT IN THE ENVIRONMENT SIMPLY TETHERING. THAT CAP TO THE BOTTLE AND THIS BILL DOES NOT SPECIFY ANY PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY THERE ARE NUMBER OF THEM. AND DEPENDING ON. THE WHETHER IT'S A CARBONATED BOTTLED HOT SO CALLED FILL OUR WATER THERE ARE DIFFERENT. THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT IS POSSIBLE IN FACT MOST THE BY THE COMPANIES WE'VE TALKED TO SUGGEST THAT THEY AREN'T MOVING TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND IN LOOKING AT. THE VARIOUS OPTIONS THEIR NUMBER DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WHERE THESE BOTTLES ARE ALREADY OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE. SO WE'RE TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE BOTTLING INDUSTRY. AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP FACILITATE AND PUSH THEM. TO. ENSURE THAT THE CAPS COME BACK WITH THE BOTTLES THEMSELVES AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH. PULL TABS ON ALUMINUM CANS THAT WAS LEGISLATIVE ACTION THAT THAT PUSHED THAT CHANGE SO THAT THERE WASN'T THAT LITTLE BIT OF. ALUMINUM THAT WAS PRETTY PRETTY PERVASIVE IN THE ENVIRONMENT THE TIME NOW THEY MOSTLY COME BACK AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I HAVEN'T. ALRIGHT THANK YOU SO. NOW YOU HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT COMMITTEES. THANK YOU CHAIR MERITS TO CARRY ON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CRAIG CADWALLADER AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF SURFRIDER IN APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PERCENT OF MARINE PLASTICS COME FROM TRASH IN URBAN RUNOFF AND IF WE DON'T REDUCE PLASTICS ENTERING THE OCEAN. THEY'LL BE MORE PLASTIC THAN TISH IN THE OCEAN BY TWENTY FIFTY. BOTTLE CAPS ARE THE THIRD MOST COMMON ITEM FOUND ON THE BEACH IS WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE INTERNATIONAL COASTAL CLEANUP DATE DATA. THEY ARE A COMMON FORM OF ST LITTER POLLUTING OUR COMMUNITIES THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS ARE WIDE RANGING. NINETY PERCENT OF SEA BIRDS HAVE INGESTED PLASTICS MANY DIE OF STARVATION WAS STOMACHS FULL OF PLASTIC CAPS AND OTHER PLASTICS MISTAKE PER FOOD. NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED MARINE SPECIES ARE IMPACTED. YEAH PLASTICS BREAKDOWN INTO MICRO PLASTICS IN THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO ACCUMULATE POLLUTANTS FROM SEA WATER. MICRO PLASTICS ARE PRESENT IN OUR SEAFOOD SALT HONEY BEAR AND DRINKING WATER RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO EAT SHELLFISH RATE REALLY CAN BE EATING UP TO ELEVEN THOUSAND PIECES. OF MICRO PLASTIC PER YEAR. CONNECTING THE CAPS IS ONE SIMPLE WAY TO DECREASE PLASTIC POLLUTION RECENT RESEARCH FOUND THAT U. S. ON AUSTRALIAN STATES WITH BOTTLE DEPOSITS. THIS CHARGE SIXTY PERCENT FEWER PLASTIC BOTTLES TO COASTAL WATERS THAN NON BOTTLE DEPOSIT STATES YET THE CAPS WERE CONNECTED THERE WOULD BE LESS CAP POLLUTION. COMING FROM STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY ADDRESSED LETTER FROM ALUMINUM CAN PULL TABS IS CREATED AS. WAS PREVIOUSLY STATED. YEAH THE LEGISLATION IS OVERLY ALREADY CONSIDERED THE BILL BUT THIS ISN'T ROCKET SCIENTISTS IT'S TIME TO FORCE. A DECISION TO FIGURE THIS OUT SURFRIDER IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO MEMBERS SUPPORTERS AND ACTIVISTS ENCOUNTER BOTTLE CAPS AND OTHER PLASTIC POLLUTION. WITH INCREASING FREQUENCIES AS A MATTER OF FACT JUST YESTERDAY I WAS DOING WATER SAMPLES IN THE BIO WETLANDS. WHICH WAS A TEAM WITH WILDLIFE AND I PICKED UP A BOTTLE CAPS REGULARLY THERE AND THEY WERE EVERYWHERE SO WE THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MISSION. GOOD EVENING SHARON MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED ATTENTION. KELLY MIGHT BE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY NINE I'VE ALSO BEEN ASKED TO REALLY SUPPORT FOR UPSTREAM. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CONSUME ELEVEN AND A HALF BILLION PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES EVERY YEAR. NO DESPITE OUR HIGH RECYCLING RATE FOR THESE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST FIVE BILLION AND UP TO TEN BILLION OF THE CAPS THAT BELONG TO THOSE. BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE NOT RECYCLED AND IN FACT AND UP IN OUR LANDFILLS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS THE EQUIVALENT OF BETWEEN THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIX MILLION OF THESE PLASTIC BOTTLE CAPS. BEING DISCARDED EVERYDAY. IN ADDITION TO BEING ONE OF THE TOP THREE ITEMS FOUND DURING CALIFORNIA BEACH CLEANUPS. THESE PLASTIC BOTTLE CAPS SIGNIFICANTLY IT POLLUTES OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND CONTRIBUTE TO BLIGHT AS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. AT TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AN RTC STUDY FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES ARE SPENDING CLOSE TO HALF A BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. TO PREVENT TRASH FROM ENTERING THEIR STREETS PARKS AND STORM DRAINS AND WE KNOW THAT THESE COSTS ARE ONLY GOING TO RISE AS CALIFORNIA RECENTLY ENACTED REGULATIONS. REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IVAN. AND TO FURTHER REDUCE THE TRASH LOW TO THE STORM DRAINS. NAVY TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY NINE DOES NOT MANDATE A PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE CONNECTED CAPS BUT RATHER IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO BEVERAGE COMPANIES TO DETERMINE THE DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY THAT WORKS BEST FOR THEIR PRODUCT. AND CUSTOMER BASE AND WE KNOW THAT THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. CRYSTAL GEYSER SPRINGWATER OPERATING RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY TETHERING CAPS ON ONE OF THEIR. WATER LINES. I NOT ONLY PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL PLASTIC THEY USE AND EVEN SAVING MONEY ON THEIR PRODUCTION OF THIS LINE IN THE PROCESS. SEVERAL EUROPEAN COMPANIES HAVE INVESTED IN SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES FOR JUICE AND SPORTS DRINKS BEVERAGES AND PROTOTYPES AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN USE FOR HOT FILL AND CARBONATED BEVERAGES. IN A FINAL POINT RECYCLERS WANT TO CAPTURE THE PLASTIC FROM THESE CAPS RECYCLING EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY DESIGNED TO HANDLE. AYE THESE CAPS AND TO ATTACK THEIR TOP WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW RECYCLERS. CAPTURE MORE OF THIS MATERIAL. I AND TO SELL A GREATER QUANTITY OF IT INTERN. IN CLOSING A TETHER TOP IS A WIN WIN SOLUTION FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT FOR RECYCLERS AND FOR OUR PERSONAL CONVENIENCE. IT IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT WILL PREVENT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF ALL CAPS FROM BECOMING BLADES AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND PLASTIC POLLUTION AND OUR OCEANS. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE WAY AYE ARCHER AYE ABOUT THINKING. ANY WITNESS FURTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE COME FORWARD. AND ONLY SERVER WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT THINK YOU. QUALIFY ME DONNA WITHOUT OF ON CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. TERESA BURKE* ON BEHALF OF HILL THE BAY IN SUPPORT. LUCAS FRERICHS THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SUPPORT. GENEVIEVE AVEDON ON BEHALF OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOBBYING COALITION UPSTREAM POLICY CLEAN WATER ACTION AND THE TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND AND SUPPORT AND I JUST WANNA ECHO THAT A LOT OF THE. TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE USE THE SAME OR LESS AMOUNT OF PLASTIC AND SO THUS DON'T COST ANY. ADDITIONAL MONEY TO MANUFACTURERS. JUST KNOWN FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY ECHO CA WC EXCELLENT TESTIMONY. BOTH OF THEM ON BEHALF OF STUDENTS FROM SUPPORT. I MEAN TAR WITH ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA WE ALSO SUPPORT THINKING. FILE JONES CIRCLE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. RUN STRUCK FRIENDS OF THE RIVER IN SUPPORT. RIGHT THANKS VERY MUCH FOR UP WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD FOUR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MONIES MIKE VARNEY I'M FROM A VERY BROTHERS BOTTLING WE DO OR SEVEN UP INDEPENDENT BOTTLER IN MODESTO. ON THE PRESIDENT AND OUR FAMILIES RUN THE BUSINESS FOR EIGHTY YEARS AND MODESTO WE'VE. WE PRODUCE AND WE DISTRIBUTE. BROUGHT BRANDS THE A FOR MERCED COUNTY ALWAYS SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND FROM THE FOOTHILLS TO. OTHER BILLS SO WE. KINDA ARE FAMILIAR WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PACKAGING TECHNIQUES WE KIND OF FEEL THAT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE KINDA. BEEN THE LEADER IN PACKAGING WE DID A LOT OF STUFF WITH CANS WAY BEFORE CANS WERE. IN A TWELVE PACK CARTONS AND DIFFERENT TYPES. BUT WE FEEL THAT THIS. BEING LED TO. A BUT. ENCLOSURE FOR A BOTTLE. THAT WILL STAY TETHERED IT'S GONNA BE VERY HARD FOR US TO MANAGE. I SPOKE WITH A FEW OF OUR MACHINERY COMPANIES THAT WE DO THAT WE USE FOR OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS TO PUT THE CAP ON TWO BOTTLES. THEY. HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT CARBONATED SOFT DRINKS WITH THE A FLIP TOP CAP. YOU KNOW BOTTLE WATER IS LOT LOT EASIER TO PUT A CAP ON THAT ARE TWO OTHER IT AND PUT SUPPORT CAP ON. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A CARBONATED SOFT DRINK WITH HIGH PRESSURE ITEM AND WHEN YOU GO ON A HOT FEEL. THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT. EVEN WITH THE SPORT CAP. THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SPORT CAP LIKE THIS WHEN I HEAR. IS A KIND OF LIKE THE HIGH END THIS WORKOUT THERE'S ALSO THERE'S ALL ALWAYS GOING TO BEA. BILL FOR BRING ON THE SAME. TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM OPENING A MINUTE STORES TAMPERING WITH THEM. AND THAT PILFERING ONCE PULLED OFF. GETS DISCARDED. USUALLY AT HIGHER HIGHER RATE THAN WITH THE CAP. SO THIS RING COMES OFF AND YOU DO HAVE THIS PIECE OF PLASTIC. THAT. MAJORITY TIMES. TOSSED BECAUSE IT'S LEFT OVER. A SECOND THING THAT PEOPLE DO WITH WORKSHOPS IS THEY'VE. TAKE OFF LIKE THIS AND DRINK FROM IT. SO YOU HAVE A CAP THAT IS NOW REMOVED FROM THE BOTTLE. YOU KNOW I PUT MY CAPS BACK ON. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T. SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THERE. WE JUST FEEL THAT. YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT WITH THE KEEP THE CAP ON CAMPAIGN THAT'S RUNNING HOPEFULLY THAT'LL HELP EDUCATE PEOPLE ON TRYING TO KEEP THE CAPS ON THE ON BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. BUT WE FEEL THAT. HAVING BE MANDATED TO HAVE A TETHERED CAP OR SPORT CAP ON ALL OUR BEVERAGES IS. CAN BE VERY EXPENSIVE FOR US. EMPLOYEE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE IN MODESTO AREA. AND WE FEEL IF WE HAVE TO SPEND. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON SOME MACHINERY IT'S IT'S GONNA HIT OUR BOTTOM LINE PRETTY HARD. SO I WOULD SUGGEST A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY FOX I AM THE REGIONAL ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE FOR A SMALL BEVERAGE COMPANY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CALLED NARROW. WE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY. MY BUSINESS HERE IS OBVIOUSLY TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF SMALL BEVERAGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS BILL IN THE THINK. EVERY SINGLE PERSON IS FROM COKE OR PEPSI OR DR PEPPER SNAPPLE AND HAS UNLIMITED RESOURCES. AT ABILITIES TO INVESTIGATE THIS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY. I'M STANDING HERE SAYING WE HAVE EIGHTY EMPLOYEES AND THAT IS A NATIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT WORK FOR THIS BRAND. I'VE BEEN HERE SIX YEARS. OUR BRAND IS OUR BOTTLES THAT IS OUR CONDUCT RECOGNITION THAT IS WHAT WE HOLD CLOSE TO US AS A COMPANY. AND TO PURSUE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY DOES NOT EXIST RIGHT NOW AT LEAST FOR OUR BRAND FOR OUR PACKAGING FOR OUR PRODUCT. WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR US AS A COMPANY. WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ALONE JUST TO DESIGN A PRODUCT OR A MACHINE THAT DOESN'T EXIST YET. AND REALISTICALLY FOR US WE DON'T KNOW IF IT COULD EXIST WE DON'T KNOW IF WE COULD KEEP THIS BOTTLES INTEGRITY. WHEN WE DID A TEST STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WITH BRAND AWARENESS CAME BACK THAT SEVENTY NINE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE WERE TEST MARKETING. KNEW OUR BOTTLES BASED ON THE SHAPE OF OUR BOTTLES NOW YOU KNOW THE DISCUSSION CAN BE THAT YES WE WANT PEOPLE TO KEEP THE CAPLAN'S WE WE WANT THEM TO BE EDUCATED OUR BOTTLES ARE HUNDRED PERCENT RECYCLABLE. ON THAT IS ON OUR BOTTLES THAT IS BRANDED AS FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO BE EDUCATED IF WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE TO TETHER. ON A STATIC LEVEL I PERSON WHO YOU DON'T WANT THIS IN MY FACE WHEN I'M DRINKING MY PRODUCTS. THAT'S NOT LOOKING AFTER OUR CONSUMER AND THAT'S ALSO FORCING US TO GO INTO MORE PRODUCTION SLOWER PRODUCTION WERE SMALL COMPANY PRODUCTION IS A VERY BIG THING TO US AND HOW WE CAN KEEP UP WITH OTHER PEOPLE AND DEMANDS. AS WELL AS THAT BUILDS ON TO TO INCLUDE THINGS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OUT THERE LIKE SPORTS CAPS ARE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC ALONE. OMINOUS A COMPANY WE TRIED TO REDUCE OUR PLASTIC IMPRINT. AN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN STRIVING TO DO SO THIS IS JUST GOING TO OUTSIDE. TO MATERIALS BEING DRIVEN OUT THAT'S GONNA BECAUSE THE COST OF OUR PRODUCT TO BE DRIVEN UP. AND IT'S REALLY FOR SMALL COMPANIES LIKE OURS GOING TO PROBABLY PUT US OUT OF BUSINESS. LET ALONE THE FACT THAT OUR PRODUCTS CAN BE BOUGHT ON STE ECOMMERCE SITES LIKE AMAZON. NO PRODUCTS CAN BE BOUGHT ONLINE AND SHIPPED INTO CALIFORNIA. LIKE INTRIGUED AS THE PARLIAMENT. YOU KNOW SO SO THAT WHOLE A LIMITS TO IT THE TETHERING IS WELL WE DON'T WANT POLLUTION WE WANT TO EDUCATE CONSUMERS TO KEEP THAT CAP ON THE BOTTLE IT IS ALL RECYCLABLE. ON THE DISAPPEAR AND SAY THAT WE ALL HAVE TO TETHER ON WE'VE THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS WE CARBONATED LIGHTLY CARBONATED AND FAST YOU DO WHAT'S RIGHT. SO JUST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE SMALL BEVERAGE WE ASK THAT YOU GUYS VOTE IN OPPOSITION AND VOTE AND NO ON THIS BILL ON IN PLEASE KEEP THE SMALLER COMPANIES IN MIND THIS IS COULD BE CATASTROPHIC FOR CALIFORNIA BUSINESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE. IT TO SAY GOOD EVENING I'LL BE BRIEF. MY NAME IS GRANT DEARIE WHEN NOR CAL BEVERAGE COMPANY IT WAS SACRAMENTO WE ARE A FAMILY OWNED BOTTLER. WILL BE. SOBRINA EIGHTIETH YEAR. THIS YEAR. AND WE ARE A MAJOR CONTRACT PACKED PACKING MANUFACTURE THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. AND WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT OUR BOTTOM LINE AND SYSTEMS WE HAVE A PLAN HERE. WAS SACKED A WOMAN IN A TIME. WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED TO. TWO SEVEN SEVEN NINE BECAUSE TETHERING WE WE SEE. THE INDUSTRY IS WITH US ALWAYS BEEN VERY INNOVATIVE AND OVER TIME I AM SURE THAT WILL COME UP WITH A VIABLE SOLUTION TO. THE THE LETTER ISSUE. THAT MAY INCLUDE A SOLUTION TETHER AND ONE OF OUR ISSUES CONCERNS IS OBVIOUSLY ALL THE CAMPING EQUIPMENT THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MODIFY. SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS INVESTMENT IN THE MILLIONS. TO ARE ALSO TO OUR BOTTOM LINE AS A COMPANY. WE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDS AS A COMPANY WE ARE VERY ENVIRONMENT CONSCIOUS. THE TAMPA BAY AND. EVIDENCE OF TAMPERING WITH WITH. ENCLOSURES. AND LOSING THAT FUNCTIONALITY WITH POTENTIALLY WITH NOTHINGNESS DEVELOPED QUITE YET. SATISFY. YOU KNOW PEACE OF MIND IN THE HOLE TETHERING OR A YOU KNOW TAMPERING. AND QUALITY CONTROL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IN THE MAJOR LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT'S A MAJOR CONCERN. SO WE ARE WE BELIEVE THE INDUSTRY THE CAPPING CLOSURE INDUSTRY THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY WILL WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. YOU KNOW INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO THIS ISSUE. WE DON'T THINK THAT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE STATE TO MANDATE FORCE THIS ACTION. UPON THE BOTTLING INDUSTRY THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY AND THAT IT WILL HAPPEN OVER TIME AND THAT. FOR THAT REASON WE ASPIRIN ABOUT. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS KEEP BELT CAPITAL ADVOCACY FOR THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA AUTOMATIC VENDORS COUNCIL BE VERY BRIEF. WHAT WE SUPPORT INCREASING RECYCLING AND? REDUCING LITTER WE DON'T THINK THAT MANDATING CAPS ON ALL MODELS REALLY FEASIBLE FOR THE INDUSTRY. IN IT AS FOLKS OF MENTIONS ACTUALLY DOES INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC IS BEING USED IN THE CAPS WHEN YOU TETHER THEM. SO WE UNDERSTAND FROM SOME MANUFACTURERS THAT THERE'S NO REAL DATE WE APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S NO DATE IN THE BILL BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND FOR MANUFACTURERS AS NO REAL DATE THAT CAN WORK ACROSS ALL PRODUCT NOT LINES RIGHT NOW. AND FOR THE CARBONATED HOT FILTER MAY NOT BE A DATE THAT COULD ACTUALLY WORK. SO RETAILERS CAN'T SELL THE PRODUCTS CAN IMPACT OUR BUSINESSES JOBS AND OVERALL ECONOMY FOR OUR INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SO WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD. DENNIS ALBION A ON BEHALF OF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE. ARMANDO FLOORS OF THE VALLEY MISSION COMES SO HE'S ASSOCIATION ARE WE OPPOSE. MADISON DIE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. JERRY MCKEE REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THIRTY YEARS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE FOOD PRODUCERS IN OPPOSITION. AT A RALLY ON BEHALF OF THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN A POSITION. A JOE ACCURATELY HIT THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION POST. THERE ARE THOMAS ON BEHALF OF THE INTERNATIONAL BOTTLED WATER ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA BAR WATER CESSATION OPPOSITION. DON KEPT KEY ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO POST. ALRIGHT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MINISTER FLOOR. IT'S VERY THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SACRAMENTO I. APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. BUT JUST A QUICK QUESTION TO THE OUT HAS ANYTHING BEEN DONE TO TO ADDRESS THE HOT FILLED OR CARBONATED. PART OF THIS BILL HE DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AT ALL. WELL THIS THIS BILL HAS ESSENTIALLY BEEN IN PRINT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW. AND WE'VE HAD A COUPLE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION AND I'VE BEEN VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT WE'RE WILLING TO WORK ON A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS AND SO FAR. WE'VE BEEN PRETTY MUCH IGNORED OR COR JUST TOLD NO. WE'VE BROUGHT AROUND TO MOST OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS EXAMPLES I LIKE SPORTS CAPS EITHER THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE BROUGHT READ TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ANYBODY'S INTERESTED SOME EXAMPLES OF WHERE THIS ACTUALLY WORKS POTENTIALLY COULD WORK WITH EXISTING MACHINERY. BUT YET I'M NOT TRYING TO SELL ANY PARTICULAR IDEA OR ANY PARTICULAR SOLUTION. THE MAJOR BOTTLERS TALK TO US ABOUT THAT THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IN FACT SOME BOTTLED WATER. DISTRIBUTORS CRYSTALLIZE OR BROUGHT IN SOME EXAMPLES WHERE THEY ARE CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTING ONE OF THE FLIP TOP I WOULD NOT EVER SUGGEST PUTTING A FLIP TOP ON. A. ON A A. BE PRESSURIZED BOTTLE LET THAT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE BUT SOME OF THE OTHER SOLUTIONS. DO ATTACK RELEASE THE GAS DO IN FACT HAVE THE SAME INTEGRITY THE CAP. PHYSICALLY FIT THE SAME DIMENSIONS AS EXISTING BOTTLE CAPS IN REALLY HAVE NO MORE PLASTIC MAN I'M NOT. TRYING TO PROMOTE ANY ONE PARTICULAR SOLUTION NOT JUST ASK THE INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE WHAT. WITH RESPECT TO THE SMALL BOTTLERS AND DEAL OF SYMPATHY FOR. THE SITUATION IS MORE BOTTLER HAS FOUND THEM THEMSELVES IN THE EASY SOLUTION FOR THEM TO SUCCUMB ASK WOULD WE BE WILLING TO PUT. A. A CAP ON THIS OR SAY ONLY FOR LARGE BOTTLERS NOT FOR SMALL BOTTLERS LET'S TALK ABOUT IT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A REAL CONVERSATION. ABOUT THIS BILL FOR OVER A YEAR NOW. AND PARTLY. THAT THE REASON WHY I THINK THIS IS I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN PASS THIS THROUGH. IF WE CAN SHOW THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE THIS AND THIS IS ONE THE REASONS MISTER CALDERON CAME ON BOARD BECAUSE HE'S VERY CONCERNED ABOUT PLASTIC POLLUTION THE AMOUNT OF CLASSICS THAT WE FIND IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. BOTTLE CAPS IS ONE NAY V. MOST SIGNIFICANT IN UBIQUITOUS PIECES OF TRASH THAT'S OUT THERE. WE CAN ALWAYS SAY WELL THE LETTERING ISSUE LET'S JUST DO A CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE PEOPLE THAT HAS. NEVER WORKED IN THE PAST I DON'T KNOW WHY IT WOULD WORK NOW. SO CREATING A REALISTIC STRUCTURE FOR DATES A REALISTIC STRUCTURE FOR THE KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES A WHICH BOTTLES WERE TALKING ABOUT. BROKE INTO THAT THEM SPEAKING ABOUT BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MISTER CALDERON BECAUSE WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. BUT HE WAS LIKE OUTSIDE THE COMPANY SIDE THE BOTTLERS. WE'RE OPEN TO THAT. MAKE IS ENOUGH. LET'S TALK ABOUT IT A SIMPLE NO WE'RE DONE WITH THE NOW. AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE OF OUR WILLINGNESS TO DEAL IN OUR WILLINGNESS TO TALK THROUGH THE ISSUES. AND REALLY LOOK FOR A SOLUTION SET UP A REALISTIC TIME LINE THERE'S REALLY NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF HERE. WE CAN SAY NO WE'RE GOOD THAT WE KNOW HOW TO SHUT THINGS DOWN. SINGLE BIGGEST COMPLAINT I GET BUT ABOUT THIS BILL IN MY DISTRICT IS WHY DON'T I JUST BANNED SINGLE USE PLASTIC BOTTLES. THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS ARE TALK ABOUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE I'D RATHER. TAKE THE STEP TO TRY AND WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY. TO MODIFY THE PRODUCTS MAKE THE PRODUCT LESS HARMFUL FOR THE VERY SPECIFIC REASONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND SEE IF THERE'S A WAY FORWARD. THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING AT THIS POINT SO FOR THIS COMMITTEE WERE ASKING TO MOVE THE BILL. AND CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS THE NEXT HURDLE OBVIOUSLY WILL BE THE FLOOR WE KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIG CONVERSATION. AND I'M OPEN THAT MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE WILL LOOK AT THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. LOOK AT THE GOOD FAITH WE'VE ENTERED INTO AND LOOK AT THE ABSENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE AND SAY. BUT. COME TO THE TABLE SO WE'RE ASKING COME TO THE TABLE. WELL THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO TO FACILITATE THOSE MEETINGS TO GET US TO A PLACE OF SUPPORT I'M. I'M YOURS SECRETARY I'LL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT PROCEED YES BUT WOULD HELP. YEAH. MS EGGMAN THAN THIS LONDON'S. AND THANK YOU MISTER STONE. I'M. MCCURRY I MISS THE SAME WATER BOTTLE I'VE HAD FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS AND EVERY COMMITTEE HAVE SAT ON AND THE. YES I HAVE A LITTLE OCD AS WELL. BUT PERSONALLY I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA. I WILL SAY DO THE SAME THING I SAID TO YOU IN JANUARY. GET THE INDUSTRY TO THE TABLE. OR IF WE CAN GET SOME KIND OF DEAL I WON'T BE ABLE TO BE WITH YOU ON THE FLOOR. BUT I HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR SOME OF THE SMALLER BOTTLERS AND AND JUST ABOUT ME THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES AS YOU CLEARLY KNOW AND YOU CLEARLY ACKNOWLEDGE. THERE'S THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND IT CANNOT BE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK WE NEED TO DO A LITTLE TEENY BITES. NOT BIG GIANT CHUNKS ON SO AGAIN I WILL BE WITH YOU TODAY AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE GET TO THE FLOOR THANK YOU AND I HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SEE WHAT WHAT BITES ARE POSSIBLE AND GETTING SILENCE. MS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M SO. YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU HAVE INVITED TO THE TABLE THE SMALLER BOTTLERS AND THEY HAVE REFUSED YOUR OFFER. IS THAT CORRECT I HAVE INVITED ANYBODY WHO'S COME TO TALK TO US ARE WILLING TO TALK TO US A BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THE LAST YEAR. MY DOORS OPEN. SO YOU HAVE INVITED SMALL BOTTLERS AND THEY HAVE REFUSED TO COME I HAVE INVITED ANYBODY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT THIS AND SO FAR. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO'VE COME ARE TO TELL ME THAT THERE'S THEY HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER. WELL FOR A BILL OF THIS IMPORTANCE CONSIDERING IT HAVE SUCH AN ENORMOUS EFFECT ON THIS INDUSTRY. I COULD. I FEEL LIKE THAT ONUS IS ON YOU. THE AUTHOR TO BRING EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE TO WORK THROUGH THIS SO THAT WE'RE NOT ON NECESSARILY HARMING. AN INDUSTRY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SOME LIKE WITH THIS BOTTLE OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT WITH THE WATER BOTTLES I THINK IT IS EASIER. AND I DID SEE THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE BROUGHT BY THE OFFICES. BUT FOR OTHER BEVERAGES IT'S NOT A SIMPLE AND I JUST I'M ASTOUNDED THAT. YOUR ATTITUDE IS. THE IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME THIS SOLUTION I WANT THAT WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO TALK THAT'S HOW IT'S COMING ACROSS THE OF NO IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY THE OTHER WAY AROUND. BECAUSE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THIS PLACE. AND WHAT I WANNA DO IS REDUCE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF. BOTTLE CAPS THAT WE FIND OUT. IN THE COMMUNITY. SO I PROPOSE A SOLUTION AND I'VE BEEN VERY OPEN AND OF INVITING ANYBODY WANTS TO COME TALK TO ME. I CAN'T MAKE THEM COME TALK TO ME. SO WE'RE AT THE POINT RIGHT NOW I'M JUST BEING VERY I'M TO TRY TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT. THE SITUATION I FIND MYSELF I THINK IT'S COMPELLING POLICY. AND I THINK IT'S WORTH HAVING A CONVERSATION. THE OPPOSITION RIGHT NOW KNOWS THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO KILL THIS BILL ANY POINT IN TIME SO IT'S NOT WORTH THEIR TIME. TO COME TALK TO ME. I'M TRYING TO. IF I COULD MOVE THE BILL ENOUGH. TO GET THEM TO THE TABLE TO TALK. AND I'VE BAXI BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT AREAS THAT I'M WILLING MISTER CALDERON ARE WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND MOVE IT FORWARD. I CAN ACCESS. I CAN INVITE. AND TALK ABOUT IT. BUT THERE'S ONLY. SHE GOT A SUGGESTION. I'M ALL EARS. WELL. AGAIN I JUST THINK. THIS IS OMETHING. JUST SENDING OUT IN IN AN INVITATION YOU KNOW VIA EMAIL OR A PHONE CALL SAYING. YOU KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME TALK PLEASE COME BY I THINK YOU MIGHT NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE FRANKLY ON YOUR AND TO GET EVERYBODY TO THE TABLE. INCOME BUT BUT THE TWO OTHER THINGS THAT I JUST WANNA MENTION NUMBER ONE IS MY KIDS WE SAVE ALL YOU KNOW ANY BOTTLES WATER BOTTLES JUICE BOTTLES THINGS LIKE THAT. WHENEVER WE TAKE THEM TO THE RECYCLING CENTER THEY ARE REQUIRED TO REMOVE THE CAP AND THROW IT AWAY YOU CAN'T TAKE THE CAP IN THERE SO I JUST. I'M LOOKING AT THIS THINKING OKAY WHILE. THEY'RE GONNA MAKE TETHERED CAPS WHICH ARE THEN GOING TO HAVE TO BE RIPPED OFF THE BOTTLE EITHER AT HOME OR AT THE RECYCLING CENTER YOU'RE SHAKING YOUR HEAD NO BUT I AM TELLING YOU. AS SURE AS I SIT IN FRONT OF YOU MY KIDS HAVE TO TAKE THOSE BOTTLE CAPS ARE THE THE BOUGHT THE LID OFF OF THOSE BODIES AND THOSE ARE GOING TO END UP. I'M NOT DOUBTING YOU IN TEN YEARS AGO THAT USED TO BE THE THING BECAUSE RECYCLERS DID KNOW WHAT TO DO THEIR DIFFERENT LAST. NOW THEY DO. AND THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY IS IT IS TAKE MAYBE YEARS ISN'T THERE DOING IT IF I I'M I'M NOT LEARN MAYBE THEY ARE. AND THEY'RE NOT ONLY DO THEY ARE NOT IN MORE PLACES THAN JUST IN MY DISTRICT IS IS YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING. I JUST. I. I DON'T WANT TO SEE PLASTIC OUT THERE EITHER YOU KNOW AND I'VE BEEN TO YOUR DISTRICT I USED TO LIVE FRANKLY IN YOUR DISTRICT WHEN I WAS THAT. ATTENDING UNIVERSITY UP THERE AND I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU LOOKING AT THAT PRISTINE COAST DON'T YOU KNOW MONEY DO EVERYTHING YOU POSSIBLY CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T SEE GARBAGE. FLOATING IN THE WATER I REALLY DO. BUT. THIS IS ALL WHOLESALE CHANGE IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS GOING TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON NOT JUST THE BIG GUYS WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO ABSORB THAT COST BUT THE LITTLE GUYS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IN THE NAME OF. REMOVING THE PLASTICS WIPING SOME BUSINESS BUSINESS IS COMPLETELY OFF THE MAP AND I JUST I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A REASONABLE WERE APPROPRIATE APPROACH AND I'M CONCERNED THAT. THIS COMMITTEE IS CONTINUES TO PASS BILLS WHERE MEMBERS SAY WELL WE DON'T THINK IT'S QUITE COULD JET BUT WILL MOVE THE LINE. THAT'S NOT OUR JOB HERE IS COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE JOB IS TO MAKE SURE THE BILLS ARE CUT. AND. THIS ONE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT THERE IS NO. THERE'S NO PUSHED BACK TO SAY NO YOU NEED TO GET BACK TO THE TABLE NEED TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND COME TO SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION. AND AND I AND I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS IT'S AS THOUGH THAT COMMITTEE MEMBERS DECIDE WELL WE'LL LET THE GOVERNOR DEAL WITH THAT JUST LET HIM VETO IT AND WILL KEEP ALL OUR COLLEAGUES HAPPY AND VOTE FOR THEIR BILL AND MOVE ALONG. AND IT'S A WIN WIN AND NOT DUTCH JUST IRRESPONSIBLE AND LEGISLATING IN MY OPINION. BUT. WELL TELL HAVE SAY ABOUT ANY RESPONDENT DOES I DON'T IS COOKED THIS THIS IS A LEGITIMATE POLICY THAT STANDS ON ITS OWN WITHOUT AMEND YOU CAN AGREE. YOU CAN DISAGREE. THE OTHER THING THAT I'M OFFERING IS TO. TAKE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL. SEE IF THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO GO ABOUT THIS BECAUSE BOTH MISTER CALDERON AYE ARE OPEN TO BETTER WAYS BUG. GOING THROUGH THIS. THE PART THAT'S NOT COOKED IS THE DAY. WE LEFT THAT OPEN ON THIS ONE BECAUSE IT'S NOT I DID THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT POINT OF CONTENTION. AND MAYBE THERE'S A TIMELINE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE PREVIOUS BILL TIMELINE WAS TWENTY TWENTY. THOSE DEFECTS. I ADMIT WAY TOO FAST SO LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE DATE IS THE DATE A VERY EASY THING TO TO TO PUT IN THERE. AND THIS LEGISLATURE COULD MOVE THIS BILL AS IT IS. WE COULD PUT THE DATE IN THERE AND REQUIRE ALL BOTTLES TO HAVE THE TETHER CAP. BY WHATEVER THAT DATE IS THAT'S THE PART THAT'S. THE PURVIEW OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IT'S GOOD POLICY THAT STANDS ON ITS UP. I'M OFFERING. ALTERNATIVES. IF WE CAN GET SOME INPUT ON WHAT THOSE ALTERNATIVES ARE. I CAN STEP IN HERE I MEAN MS MELENDEZ ANOTHER POINT TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN TAKING PLACE FOR. FOR OVER A YEAR NOW AND AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED THIS A. THE SAME PROPOSAL LAST YEAR AND SO I I THINK I THINK WE HAVE. HAD A VERY EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND THAT THE FACT THAT MRS JONES LEAVING. THE. THE DATE OUT IS I I BELIEVE. HIS. GOOD FAITH. EFFORT TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY. RATHER THAN PUTTING SOMETHING FOR JUST IMPOSING SOMETHING THAT IS UNWORKABLE. AND I BELIEVE THAT IS. SCHOOL. LAWMAKER. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OUT AND COMMENTS FROM THE. THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. MISTER STONE WHICH YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BY ASKING ABOUT.-WE NEED A MOTION AND A SECOND. SECOND. ROLL CALL PLEASE. I AM TWENTY AB. I DON'T TWENTY AB TWENTY SEVEN THIRTY NINE BY STONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS. MEMBERS MURATSUCHI AND I MURATSUCHI AYE ACOSTA NO ACOSTA NO BLOOM. I'VE BLOOM AYE CHAU. CHAU AYE EGGMAN. EGGMAN AYE FLORA. FLORA NO LIMON. LIMON AYE MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE MELENDEZ BELINDA'S NO STONE. STONE I. SEVEN THREE. ALRIGHT BILL ITSELF. LAST BILL. YOU'RE OPPOSED. FOR THE LAST. A SURE. YOU WANT. ON. OKAY. MISTER MONEY TO SEE. MISTER JERRY WE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. ANYTIME YOU'RE A SORT. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BY CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM PRESENTING AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE TO DEFEND CALIFORNIA'S COAST. FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO RENEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING OFF OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT. TO READ NEW RE OPEN. NEW. LEASES FOR OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING BOTH ON THE WEST COAST AS WELL AS THE EAST COAST. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. FROM BOTH COASTS HAVE OPPOSED THIS PROPOSAL. IN FACT THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA. LODGED HIS OBJECTION TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ITS OBJECTION TO. DUE THE OBJECTED TO THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO RE OPEN OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. ON THE BASIS THAT IT WOULD DAMAGE THEIR. TOURISM ECONOMY THOSE SAME ARGUMENTS APPLY TO OUR BEAUTIFUL COAST HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES WE HAVE HAD A BIPARTISAN. AGREEMENT AND BIPARTISAN SUPPORT TWO OPPOSE OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING A TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S COAST. THIS BILL. PROHIBITS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. OR A LOCAL TRUSTEE FROM ENTERING INTO ANY NEW LEADS NOT AFFECTING ANY EXISTING LEASES BUT TO. PROHIBIT ANY NEW LEASE OR TO. PROHIBIT ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PIPELINES. AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT. THE INCREASE IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. TO. BASICALLY CUT OFF. ANY NEW OIL OR NATURAL GAS COMING FROM FEDERAL WATERS INTO THE THREE MILE. STATE WATERS CONTROLLED. UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. THIS IS CLEARLY A BILL. DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT OUR COAST AS WELL AS OUR ONE POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLAR. ECONOMY COASTAL ECONOMY. THAT. ARE CALIFORNIA COAST DEPENDS UPON. AS STATED IN. ONE OF THE EARLIER PRESENTATIONS WHENEVER THERE IS OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES THERE ARE ACCIDENTS WE'VE SEEN IT IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IN SANTA BARBARA. WE'VE SEEN IT A MORE RECENTLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. ARE ALSO AND THE SANTA BARBARA AREA. AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE HERE WITH A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM SANTA BARBARA MISS LIMO. THANK YOU AND CHAIR THANK YOU VICE CHAIR AND I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH CHAIR MURATSUCHI AS A JOINT AUTHORED FOR ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. JUST LAST MONTH THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A BIPARTISAN ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION EXPRESSING OUR STRONG AND UNEQUIVOCAL OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION'S DRAFT A PLAN. TO OPEN ALL THREE REGION OF CALIFORNIA'S COAST TO OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING TODAY. IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO PUT THAT RESOLUTION INTO ACTION CALIFORNIANS KNOW THE COST OF OIL FROM THE LARGEST SPILLING CALIFORNIA HISTORY NINETEEN SIXTY NINE IN SANTA BARBARA TO THE MOST RECENT RIFFLE HE OIL SPILL. MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE PAID THE PRICE INCLUDING OUR COASTAL ECONOMY WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE. FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES WE HAVE HAD AT BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT THAT WOULD NOT EXPAND. OIL DRILLING OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST THIS IS ABOUT STICKING TO THAT AGREEMENT AND ENSURING THAT WE DON'T EX SPANS OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING. I URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE AND STAND STRONG AGAINST BIG OF SHORT SIGHTED PROPOSAL. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A GOOD EVENING KYLE JOHNSON CIRCLE CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. AT A TIME WHEN ALL OF US KNOW THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS A KEY MARKET ON THE GROUND. THE FOLKS IN DC HAVE DECIDED TO INCREASE THAT EFFORT I'D DESPITE THE WILL OF CALIFORNIANS IN FACT THIS WAS ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY FOURTH. WE HAD ONLY ONE PUBLIC MEETING UP ON THIS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND OFFSHORE DRILLING A CALIFORNIA IN SACRAMENTO. OUT WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY COASTAL. DESPITE THAT LIMITED ACCESS. ARE HUNDREDS OF OF FOLKS WERE ABLE TO COME UP HERE FROM AS FAR AWAY AS SANTA BARBARA AS FAR AWAY AS ORANGE COUNTY. TO EXPRESS THEIR DISPLEASURE WITH THE PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION TO THAT THOUSANDS OF COMMENTS WERE FILED IN OPPOSITION TO THAT PROPOSAL. BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE PROBLEMS WITH INCREASED HARDER FOR US TO MEET OUR CLIMATE CALLS. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WILL LET THE ADMINISTRATION KNOW THAT IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO IGNORE THE WILL THE PUBLIC AND DRIVE WHICH IS OUT WE CAN RESPOND IN KIND. AND PREVENT THIS PLAN FROM WORKING ON THE GROUND AYE BY LIMITING KNEW. INFRASTRUCTURE ONLY OUT WE WILL NOT BE S. ALLOW FOR ANY INCREASE ACTIVITY TO HAPPEN AND WE CAN THEN PROTECT OUR COAST IN LINE WITH THE PUBLIC WANTS OUTLIER DRIVE OUT TODAY THINKING. GOOD EVENING MEMBERS I'M AARON EVANS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES OVER SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE. CALIFORNIA STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WORK TO PRESERVE THE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE FOR NUMEROUS PURPOSES INCLUDING RECREATION AND ENJOYMENT OF THE PUBLIC. THIS INCLUDE SIXTY ONE CITIES ALONG CALIFORNIA'S COAST. THE LEAGUE HAS LONGSTANDING POLICY THAT SUPPORTS PROHIBITING OFFSHORE DEVELOPMENT. BUT DUE TO POTENTIAL ON SHORE IMPACTS. AS WE CONSIDERED THIS MEASURE WE RECONSIDER THAT POLICY AND AFFIRMED IT AS WELL UP FOR THESE REASONS THE LEAGUE SUPPORTS US MEASURE AND URGES ARE AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH INDEED.

CRAIG HAD WELDER SURFRIDER SOUTH BAY ANTI MIGHT TAKE A MOMENT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. IF WE LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED AT HERMOSA BEACH TO SHUT DOWN THAT OIL PROJECT I PERSONALLY PUT IN OVER FOUR THOUSAND HOURS ON THIS ON PAID AND. WE FOUGHT THERE IS FIFTY FOUR PERCENT TURNOUT AND SEVENTY NINE AND HAVE PERCENT NO VOTE THINK WE'D LIKE THIS HELP SUPPORT THAT SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. OPPOSITION WITNESSES COME UP. SAME RULES THREE PEOPLE TWO MINUTES EACH OF US ALL KNOW THE DRILL. SOME WITH DINNER. CHAIR MEMBERS WITH SUCH AS WITH WITH SPOT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO AB. SEVENTY FIVE AYE WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL TAKE AWAY SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE ITS OWN ENERGY RESOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BILL BY TAKE THAT IT WILL TAKE EXISTING AUTHORITY AWAY FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION. TO ISSUE RENEW MODIFY EXTEND ELISE ARE CONVEYANCE FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION IF THE LEASE WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF ALL PRODUCTION FROM FEDERAL WATERS. AND IN FACT. THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY SENT A LETTER EARLIER THIS YEAR TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONDEMNING. THAT THE OFFER LEASES AND HAS ALSO ADOPTED RESOLUTIONS. OPPOSING THE PROPOSED FEDERAL ACTION. IN ADDITION THE BILL IN OUR INTERPRETATION. EVEN AS AMENDED. STILL CONTAINS UNDEFINED OVERLY BROAD LANGUAGE THAT THAT WOULD ALSO CAPTURE IN OUR VIEW EXISTING PRODUCTION AND ULTIMATELY AND IT. FOR EXAMPLE IT IS UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT INCREASE MEANS OR HOW THE PRODUCTION WOULD BE MEASURED. BUT DOES THE PROHIBITION ALSO APPLY TO EXISTING FEDERAL LEASES AS WELL. ON ON THAT POINT I DO WHAT I THINK THE AUTHORS OFFICE IN THE COMMITTEE FOR MEETING WITH US ON THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. ON HOW THE BILL AS WRITTEN COULD AFFECT EXISTING PRODUCTION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING. THAT PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE THAT WE'VE HAD OF THE BILL MOVES TODAY. AND THAT'S THERE IS ALREADY AN EXISTING REGULATORY FRAMEWORK WITHIN THE COMMISSION THAT PROVIDES THE FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION NEEDED. FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE OF. EXCUSE ME DEVELOPMENT OF DOMESTIC ENERGY SUPPLIES THAT ARE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO. AB SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE ENERGY ABOUT NO THANK YOU. DO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF P. ANTHONY THOMAS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION CEPA. AND THE CALIFORNIAN AFTER GAS PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION WANT TO THANK. MY COUNTERPART IT WAS BEFORE AS OUTLINED IN HIS DESCRIPTION. A SOME OF OUR CONCERNS ONE A SLIGHTLY EXPAND ON A COUPLE AND PROVIDES A MONETARY CONSEQUENCES WITHIN THE TIME ALLOTTED. IF THE AUTHORS AND SUPPORTERS OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WERE LOOKING TO HALT PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA. BUT TO LOOK INTO HOW PRODUCTION CALIFORNIA THIS IS YOUR FOR. THIS IS YOUR BILL. NOW HOWEVER IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING HOW PRODUCTION IN STATE THE CALIFORNIA IN THE BIN THEN THE BILL SHOULD REFLECT EXPANDED PRODUCTION. SHOULD NOT REFLECTED TO MEET SAID NOT REFLECT. SPEND IT PRODUCTION. WHICH IMPACTS CURRENT PRODUCTION. LET ME REPEAT THAT IF YOUR GOAL IS NOT TO HALT PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BILL SHOULD NOT REFLECT EXPANDED PRODUCTION. IMPACTS CURRENT PRODUCTION PAGE TWO SECTION ONE LINE TEN TO THIRTEEN IS NOT CLEAR NOR IT'S PAGE THREE SAME SECTION SMALL BE LINE EIGHT THROUGH TWELVE. THIS IS AMBIGUITY AT ITS FINEST MEMBERS SO WE WOULD ASK IF THIS IS NOT YOUR INTENTION TO HALT PRODUCTION AUTHORS THAT WE WOULD ASK THAT CORRECTION BE MADE. IN ITS PRESENT FORM SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE RESULT IN A LOSS PRODUCTION IN OUR STATE. IF IT'S SUCCESSFUL. THEN DEMAND WILL STILL BE IN OUR STATE. HALF A MILLION BARRELS OF FUEL FOR OUR CARS TRUCKS PLANES ANOTHER MOLD TO TRANSPORTATION IT WILL NOT CEASE. THE PRODUCTION VERSES USE DEFICIT WILL INCREASE NOW AND IN THE FUTURE IF THIS BILL PASSES IN ITS CURRENT FORM. HOWEVER TRANSPORTATION FUEL FROM BARGES TRANSPORTATION FROM TANKERS WILL INCREASE SPEWING THE EMISSIONS THAT SUPPORTERS OF ALLEGEDLY ATTEMPTING TO PREVENT. VIA OTHER SOURCES SUCH AS CAP AND TRADE. S. B. THIRTY TWO AND OTHERS BILL SUCH AS THIS MEMBERS WILL ALSO IMPACT MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES IN THIS INDUSTRY. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES THAT'S AS MUCH. S. AS MANY AS MANY EMPLOYEES AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. I FOUND IT INTERESTING THAT PROPONENTS AND SUPPORTERS OF MEASURE SUCH A SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE. ALL WASTE FRONT LOW THEIR POLICY PROPOSALS. HALT THIS BAND THAT. A MORATORIUM ON X. REEXAMINE ISSUES AND SO ON AND SO FORTH HOWEVER. RARELY IF AT ANYTIME DUE TO PROPONENTS CRAFTER HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE IMPACTS TO THE HUMAN CAPITAL THAT WE SIT HERE AND ATTEMPTED TO FAN ON A REGULAR BASIS. AS I CLOSE MEMBERS IT'S TROUBLING IN A BIT DISTURBING THAT SUPPORTERS SUCH AS THOSE OF SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHO'VE SPOKEN. AND ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT TAKE THE POSITION OF THE MORE SIPS MORAL SUPERIORITY WHEN IT COMES ANY POLICY RELATING TO GAS. AND OIL. IF THE BILL NEEDS MENDING LET'S AMENDED MEMBERS. THEN LET'S THAT'S AGREED TO MOVE FORWARD LET'S NOT PLACE. A BILL THAT IS ON COOKING UNPREPARED TO GO TO THE POLICY PROCESS BECAUSE THE COMPLICIT POSSIBLY COMPLICIT. PRESS INTO COMPLICITY MIDI. SAYS THAT IT'S OKAY ALL WE WOULD ASK THAT. YOU PROVIDE A FAIR BALANCE POLICY ARGUMENT WITH THIS LEAVE IT HERE WERE GLAD TO WORK ON IT TO WORK ON ITEMS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN THE MOVE ON UNTIL THEN WE STAND OPPOSED. THANK YOU I ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE IN OPPOSITION I'M SHE'S MEAN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME UP. WE JUST STATE YOUR NAME YOUR ORGANIZATION YOUR POST. ADAM READILY WITH THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP BRING BACK TO THE. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS. MS MONEY. THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIRMAN. SO. IS THAT THE POINT OF THE BILL TO HALT PRODUCTION COMPLETELY IN CALIFORNIA. NO IT IS NOT A FACT. THAT IS SPELLED OUT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ON PAGE TWO. SECTION TWO. UNDER THIS BILL SPECIFIES THAT THE PROHIBITION DOES NOT APPLY TO EXISTING OIL AND GAS PRODUCED FROM STATE WATERS. AND THAT'S ALSO REFLECTED IN THE. THE BILL LANGUAGE ON ON PAGE TWO. SO IF. BECAUSE THE BILL CONTEMPLATES THE INCREASE IN PRODUCTION YES SO IF YOU HAVE WELL AS OUT THERE THAT CURRENTLY AREN'T. YOU NOT DRAWING THIS FUEL FROM. AND THEN YOU DO AT A LATER DATE DOES THAT CONSTITUTE AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS LEGISLATION WENT WITH THIS BILL FOCUSES ON IS. BE S. A PROHIBITION ON ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD EXPAND THE CAPACITY IS SO FOR EXAMPLE AT AGAIN AS POINTED OUT IN IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS. IF EXISTING PIPELINES AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD SUPPORT INCREASED OIL OR GAS PRODUCTION FROM EXISTING LEASES. NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD AFFECT THAT. BUT WHAT THIS BILL. CALLS FOR IS PROHIBITING THE LANCE COMMISSION FROM ALLOWING ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BEYOND WHAT EXISTS CURRENTLY THAT WOULD. ALLOW AN INCREASE IN OIL OR NAT. NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION SO ANY CHANGE AT ALL TO THE STRUCTURE OUT THERE WOULD BE CONSIDERED. WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS FAR AS THIS BILL IT AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY I MEAN I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'VE GOT? IF YOU'VE GOT A WELL THAT THE HASN'T BEEN USED AND YOU MAKE SOME MINOR CHANGES OUT THERE DOES THAT MEAN. LONG NOW YOU'VE DONE SOMETHING TO IT TO INCREASE CAN PASS CAPACITY THEREFORE. WE CAN'T ALLOW THAT I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK YOU USE THE KEYWORD EXISTING IF IT EXISTS NOW IT'S ALLOWED NOTHING IN THIS BILL. AFFECTS ITS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO DO IS TO? IS TO. IS TO PROHIBIT ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR INCREASED OIL OR NATURAL GAS PRETTY. SO. FROM. I KNOW THERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT US TO AS A COUNTRY NOT AS BEING HONEST RELEASED A STATE BUT TO ACHIEVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WHICH. I DON'T THINK WE'LL EVER HAPPEN COMPLETELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE ALTHOUGH I DO THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME MORE STRIDES TOWARD BECOMING MORE INDEPENDENT BECAUSE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES HERE THAT WE CAN TAP INTO AS OPPOSED TO GETTING THOSE RESOURCES FROM COUNTRIES THAT DON'T SHARE OUR VALUES CERTAINLY DON'T SHARE CALIFORNIA'S VALUES WHEN IT COMES TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO HOW WOMEN ARE TREATED WHEN IT COMES TO. HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. THEY DO NOT THEY ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. HOW CALIFORNIA FEELS IN AMERICA FEELS SO WHEN I SEE BILLS LIKE THIS AYE I THINK WHAT GOSH THESE ARE MY CHOICES HE NOW GO WITH THIS BILL OR OR YOU? OR ARE GO WITH. TAKING FUEL FROM COUNTRIES THAT DO HORRIBLE THINGS TO FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS. SOME OF WHICH ARE OWNED FITNESS. AND THAT'S JUST NOT A CHOICE THAT I THINK IS FAIR TO ASK US TO MAKE I'M. I WISH THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS MORE OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW HOW YOU COULD SOME HOW MEET IN THE MIDDLE AND EAST COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER. BUT I WOULD BET THAT IF I ASKED THE TWO OPPONENTS TO COME UP HERE AND RESPOND TO YOU SAYING THAT NO IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THEM. AT A IF THEIR EXISTING WHILE IS THAT IT WON'T TOUCH THEM AT ALL I JUST I FEEL LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE. A DIFFERENT ANSWER THEY HIM YOU WOULD. AND IT'S NOT AGAIN IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A DEBATES ARE NOT GOING TO PUT YOU IN THAT POSITION I WOULDN'T ASK OUT OF. RESPECT FOR YOUR CHAIRMANSHIP AND THE LATE HOUR THAT IT IS. BUT I JUST. THIS IS VERY THIS IS TROUBLING FOR ME I GET WHICH YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I KNOW I HEARD YOU SPEAK ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES IF YOU'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT AS ARE MOST CALIFORNIANS I THINK WITH RESPECT TO OUR COASTLINE. BUT I CAN'T. I THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT SACRIFICING OUR CALIFORNIA VALUES AND PRINCIPLES AND MORALS IN EXCHANGE FOR. WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE SORRY BUT WELL AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THE PASSION COMES FROM A VERY LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE PASSION ALSO COMES? FROM REPRESENTING A DISTRICT THAT'S BEEN REALLY IMPACTED BY THIS. AND IN A THINK TO YOUR POINT. ABOUT HAVING COMPELLING INTERESTS THAT ARE LOOKING FOR YOU I THINK AND THE IDEA TO YOU AND I'VE I'VE SAT HERE. IN IN THIS PARTICULAR COMMITTEE FOR YOU KNOW A YEAR PLUS. ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S NOT ONLY ONE ANGLE TO LOOK AT THIS THE OTHER ANGLE IS WHAT DO WE DO S. CALIFORNIANS. TO ENSURE THAT WERE MORE MOVING MORE TOWARDS THE GREEN ECONOMY RIGHT TO A GREEN MOVEMENT A MOVEMENT THAT IS ALSO A LINES TO OTHER CALIFORNIA VALUES OF WANTING TO PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT OF WANTING TO HAVE CLEAN WATER AND CLEAN AIR AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. I RESPECT THAT YOU HAVE THE CONFLICTING COMPELLING INTEREST ON BUT I THINK THAT UP FOR ME AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MY FELLOW CO AUTHOR AND OR AUTHOR AND THE JOINT. AND IT'S IT IS MOVING TOWARDS THAT PARTICULAR SPACE TO A SPACE THAT IS ALIGNED WITH CALIFORNIA VALUES AND I KNOW THAT WHEN I BROUGHT THAT. RESOLUTION FORWARD I AM I BROUGHT IT FORWARD KNOWING THAT MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA FEELS THAT THIS AND THAT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT LETTER IS NEXT TO THEIR VOTING RECORD. AT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REFLECTIVE OF FOR CALIFORNIA AS A STATE WANTS TO SEE US GO ANSWER FOR THOSE REASONS WE FIGHT FOR IT. AND IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT. YOU KNOW I MEAN MY DISTRICT IS A IS A GOOD EXAMPLE YOU HEARD THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION TO TESTIFY ABOUT HOW IN HERMOSA BEACH THERE THERE WAS. OVER EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE OPPOSE NEW OIL DRILLING IN HERMOSA BEACH AND THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN GET TO THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS WITHOUT HAVING. REPUBLICANS AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS YOU KNOW. OPPOSING OIL DRILLING THAT THAT THREATENS OUR OUR OUR COAST IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. AND I THINK WE SEE THAT THROUGHOUT THE COAST WHICH IS WHY. YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE STATEWIDE SURVEY OF CLOSE TO SEVEN PERCENT. OF CALIFORNIANS OPPOSING NEW OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING THEY HAVE MADE THE CHOICE THAT THEY WOULD RATHER. PUT THEIR. THEIR THEIR STAKE IN AND CALIFORNIA'S. NATIONAL AND GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IN RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. TO ACHIEVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE RATHER THAN DRILLING FOR FOSSIL FUELS THAT THREATEN OUR COAST. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE VOICE. OF TIMES YOU DO IT BUT I STEPPED OUT WITH EMOTION. WE DON'T I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL. AND THEN I I I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO SHUT DOWN OIL PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA THERE. PROBABLY ARE PEOPLE WANT TO DO BALLOT MEASURES ARE. BILLS BUT THIS IS NOT THE BILL I THINK THE BILL HERE'S. WERE ASKING FOR THE FLORIDA TREATMENT. WE DIDN'T QUITE GET THE FLORIDA TREATMENT AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT. THAT THE NEXT. BEST ALTERNATIVE IS TO. STRUCT OUR STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST TO PROTECT OUR COAST AND SO I THINK THIS IS A SMART WAY ABOUT DOING THAT AND I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE ADOPT THIS. THANK YOU.
