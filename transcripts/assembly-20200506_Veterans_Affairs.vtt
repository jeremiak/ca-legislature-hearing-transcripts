TO CONDUCT A STUDY TO ATTEMPT

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.533

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.670
VETERANS COMMIT SUICIDE AT SUCH

00:26:11.736 --> 00:26:14.072

00:26:14.139 --> 00:26:15.507
COMPARED TO THEIR MALE

00:26:15.573 --> 00:26:18.510
COLLEAGUES THIS IS A VERY

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:20.946
SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR FEET

00:26:21.012 --> 00:26:24.049
VETERANS. ONCE THEY GET OUT OF

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:28.653
THE MILITARY MORE WOMEN ARE

SERVING IN THE UNITED STATES

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:32.524
MILITARY. TWENTY THIRTY FIVE.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.860
TO HAVE A 15% INCREASE TO- TO

00:26:35.927 --> 00:26:38.763
WEAR OVER 20% OF MILITARY

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:41.299
MEMBERS ARE WOMEN. WOMEN ARE

00:26:41.366 --> 00:26:42.400
ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING

00:26:42.467 --> 00:26:45.070
VETERANS GROUPS. NOW HERE'S

00:26:45.136 --> 00:26:47.605
SOME STATISTICS THAT WE NEED TO

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:51.009
BEAR OUT. AND THIS IS MORE THAN

00:26:51.076 --> 00:26:57.349
JUST GUESS WORK. WOMEN VETERANS

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.383
ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.752
COMMITTING SUICIDE COMPARED TO

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:03.421
NON VETERAN WOMEN OVER THE LAST

00:27:03.488 --> 00:27:05.991

85% THAT'S TRACK. FOR VETERAN

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:16.334
WOMEN IT'S GONE UP TWO HUNDRED

00:27:16.401 --> 00:27:20.405
AND 50% NOW WE CAN ONLY GUESS

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:25.577
WHY. I BELIEVE THIS IS JUST A

00:27:25.643 --> 00:27:27.912
PERSONAL OPINION HAVING SPENT

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.547
NINE YEARS IN THE MILITARY

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:32.951
SEXUAL HARASSMENT OUT NOT RAPE

00:27:33.018 --> 00:27:34.853
DENIAL BY A COMMAND FOR SEXUAL

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:39.424
HARASSMENT MANY TIMES IN THE

00:27:39.491 --> 00:27:42.527
MILITARY AND. ASSEMBLYMAN

00:27:42.594 --> 00:27:45.630
MATHIS WILL BEAR THIS OUT MANY

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:47.766
TIMES IN THE MILITARY YOU HAVE

00:27:47.832 --> 00:27:48.366
TO WORK FOR SOMEONE THAT HATES

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:52.037
YOU. THEN YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:54.839
AND MANY WOMEN REACT TO THAT

00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:55.940
ALL OF THEM DIFFERENTLY

00:27:56.007 --> 00:27:57.342
EVERYONE'S AN INDIVIDUAL ON

00:27:57.409 --> 00:28:01.713
THAT ONE. BUT I WOULD GUESS FOR

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.982
WOMEN THAT'S INCREDIBLY

00:28:04.049 --> 00:28:07.352
DRAMATIC- IT'S THIS WOMEN IN

00:28:07.419 --> 00:28:09.087
THE MILITARY HAVE A MUCH

00:28:09.154 --> 00:28:11.523
TOUGHER THAN MANY PEOPLE AND

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:13.858
I'M NOT JUST- PICKIN ON MEN

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:15.760
MANY MEN FAIL IN THE MILITARY

00:28:15.827 --> 00:28:17.562
AND HAVE TO BE JUST CHARGE WITH

00:28:17.629 --> 00:28:18.496
THE GENERAL DOES CHARGE BECAUSE

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:21.232
THEY CAN'T HACK IT SO THAT PART

00:28:21.299 --> 00:28:26.037
OF SUICIDE. WE NEED TO DISCUSS

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:29.007
AND PREVENT. MILITARY VETERAN

00:28:29.074 --> 00:28:32.110
SUICIDE IS VITALLY NEEDED-

00:28:32.177 --> 00:28:33.711
WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING FOR A STUDY

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:36.581
TO BE DONE. IN THIS STUDY CAN

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:37.582
BE THE BEGINNING OF WHAT THE

00:28:37.649 --> 00:28:39.150
STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN DO IN

00:28:39.217 --> 00:28:40.418
ORDER TO GIVE BACK TO

00:28:40.485 --> 00:28:41.953
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SELFLESSLY

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.621
PUT THEIR LIVES IN DANGER

00:28:43.688 --> 00:28:44.689
THROUGH THEIR SERVICE TO OUR

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:47.792
NATION. THE FEDERAL VA HAS

00:28:47.859 --> 00:28:51.096
CONDUCTED VERY LIMITED STUDIES-

00:28:51.162 --> 00:28:53.098
IN MY OPINION ONCE AGAIN THIS

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:54.766
IS A PERSONAL OPINION THE VA

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:57.268
PRETTY MUCH FAILS THAT QUITE A

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:59.904
BIT OF VETERANS HEALTH CARE AND

00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:02.173
FOR WOMEN. THEY THEY ARE

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.442
HORRIBLE THEY THEY JUST DON'T

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.945
PERFORM AND I'VE ALWAYS HAD A

00:29:07.011 --> 00:29:08.847
BITTERNESS THAT GETS TO BE A

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:12.050
THEIR- IN OUR OWN CALIFORNIA

MENTION OF WOMEN NOT TO MENTION

THAT IS SIMPLY KEEP IT GENERIC

00:29:24.129 --> 00:29:27.132
VETERANS SO. THE END OF THIS

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:29.634
