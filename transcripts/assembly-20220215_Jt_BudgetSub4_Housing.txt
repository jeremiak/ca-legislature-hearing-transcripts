WRITTEN TESTIMONY BEFORE THE HEARING PLEASE SEND YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO BUDGETS OF FOUR AD ASM DOT CA DOT GOP TODAY WE ARE FOCUSING ON HOMEOWNERSHIP TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT POLICIES WE CAN MAKE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP WITH HOMEOWNERSHIP THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE KNOW THAT THE MEDIUM HOME PRICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE VERY HIGH AND THAT THE SUPPLY IS VERY LOW MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENTER. THE MARKET THANK YOU. IN L. A. COUNTY THE MEDIAN HOME PRICE IS AT A RECORD HIGH OF. EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THERE IS A ARTICLE IN THE LA TIMES- FROM THIS YEAR- WHILE THE MEDIAN HOME PRICE AND INTO A COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NEXT DOOR. IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF. DATA THAT I LIKE TO SHARE AS WE MOVE FORWARD MANY PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY HAVE MOVED AWAY FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TO INTER COUNTY OR TO EVEN SPRINGS AND NEARBY AREAS BECAUSE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS MORE ATTAINABLE. OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES HOWEVER. THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO COMMUTE ABOUT TWO HOURS EACH WAY. AND IN OUR QUEST TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS DUE TO VEHICLES. THERE'S A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH DOESN'T HELP REACH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. THIS PRACTICE IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH MANY WORKERS LIVING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ARE COMMUTING TWO BAY AREA CITIES THESE ARE DECISIONS THAT ARE. CONSTITUENTS HAVE TO MAKE EVERY DAY. BECOME HOHNER HOMEOWNER'S EVEN IF IT MEANS LIVING IN A SEPARATE COUNTY FROM WHERE YOU WORK. AND EVEN IF IT MEANS COMMUTING TWO HOURS EACH WAY. THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO DISCUSS HOW WE HELP MORE CONSTITUENTS BECOME HOMEOWNERS HOMEOWNERS. BUT NOT JUST HOMEOWNERS TWO HOURS AWAY FROM THEIR WORK BUT HOMEOWNERS. IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. WHAT POLICIES COUNTY TAKE AS THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES HAPPEN. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAD OVER TO MY CULTURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS. FOR OPENING. REMARKS AND TO INTRODUCE THE FIRST. THANK YOU CHAIR ONE MOMENT OKAY THERE WE GO THANK YOU CHAIR CARILLO- FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IN THIS SPACE IN PARTNERSHIP AS WE TRY TO TACKLE THESE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING. ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS JOINT HEARING AS WELL. THIS FALL A GROUP OF LEGISLATORS- ALMOST THIRTY OF US- AT DIFFERENT POINTS ATTENDED A- HOUSING WORKING GROUP- TOUR ACROSS THE STATE WE WERE EVERYWHERE FROM. G. GO TO CONCORD OAKLAND SALINAS INLAND EMPIRE FRESNO- SAN DIEGO LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY- REALLY TRYING TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND GRAPPLE WITH WHAT ARE THE ISSUES FACING OUR COMMUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. AND AT EVERY SINGLE STOP THE AYE THE NOTION AROUND HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THE- LACK THERE OF CAME UP. AND THIS IS A PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW VEXING ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A RELATIVELY LOW RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT- IT SAID I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY AT THIS POINT I THINK IT'S AROUND FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. BUT IT'S PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND IN AMERICA THIS IS HOW WE BUILD WEALTH IT'S HOW WE BUILD GENERATIONAL WEALTH IS THROUGH HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. AND FOR BRENDA BLACK COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW FOR MANY OF THEM. IT IS SIMPLY NOT ATTAINABLE- AND SO THERE'S A REAL EQUITY ISSUES HERE THAT WE NEED TO EXPLORE AND THINKING THROUGH HOW WE ALL CAN. HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM- IS I THINK THE CHALLENGE AND OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED IN FRONT OF US HERE- IT'S WHY I'M EXCITED TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST WITNESS AND THRILLED THAT SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE JOINED FOR THE HEARING AS WELL I KNOW THEY HAVE IT CONTINUE COMMITMENTS WELL TO SOLVING THIS PROBLEM- AND OUR FIRST. GUEST HERE WILL BE STEVEN MANDAEAN WHO IS THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF OTHERING AND BELONGING INSTITUTE STEVEN YOU'LL HAVE A COUPLE. ALLOWED THE OVERVIEW OF THE HOUSING MARKET IN CALIFORNIA AND ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR- ATTENTION TO THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT. ARE FACING OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU SHOWS SO I ASSUME I'M STARTING OUT THANK YOU YEP THANK YOU- I'M GONNA OPEN UP MY SLIDE DECK AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL SHARE I'VE BEEN ASKED TO. PRESENT ON THE DISPARITIES IN RACIAL HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES AND THEN. OUTLINED SOME POLICIES THAT ARE CAPABLE. OF PRODUCING THOSE DISPARITIES SOME TO DO THAT AND I I'VE BEEN TOLD I HAVE TWELVE MINUTES ON THIS GET. STARTED HERE. SO THIS IS A CHART THAT WAS CREATED BY THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION I'M GOING TO BREAK THIS DOWN. THAT IS CENTRALLY SHOWS DISAGGREGATED LEVELS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP ACROSS THE UNITED STATES BUT REYES. WHAT THE BASIC PATTERN SHOWS IS THAT AFTER THE GREAT DEPRESSION. ERIC CANS BY AND LARGE MOST AMERICANS DID NOT OWN THEIR OWN HOME AND MANY AMERICANS HAVE BEEN DISPOSSESSED FROM HOMEOWNERSHIP- AS A RESULT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE VERY LOW LEVELS OF HOME OWNERSHIP BUT IN THE POST WAR PERIOD HOMEOWNERSHIP SURGED AND SURGED WITH BOMBS AND IT WITH FITS AND STARTS IN THE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AS WELL. BUT HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON THIS THIS COMES FROM THE ST LOUIS FED IT SHOWS THE QUEUE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES BY RACE ACROSS UNITED STATES ABOUT 66% ROUNDING UP HERE 266% OF ALL AMERICANS OWN THEIR OWN HOME- BUT WHEN YOU DISAGGREGATE BY RACE YOU SEE HUGE DISPARITIES. SO ABOUT 74% OF WHITE AMERICANS ON THEIR OWN HOME BUT ONLY 44% OF BLACK AMERICANS WITH 48% OF LATINOS AND 61% OF ASIANS. HERE'S THE INTERESTING AND DISTURBING FACT. THIS DISPARITY% HAS ACTUALLY GOTTEN WORSE OVER TIME NOT BETTER. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WHICH IS WHEN THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT GOES INTO EFFECT. YOU'LL SEE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN NINETEEN SEVENTY IN THE COUNTRY HOMEOWNERSHIP THOUGH 66% AND BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP IS FORTY TWO PERCENT. IN TWENTY TWENTY. BOB HUGHES IN THE QUEUE FOR DATA YOU SEE THE BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP HAS INCREASED TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS ABSOLUTE INCREASE OVER THAT FIFTY YEAR PERIOD. BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THE BLACK WHITE DISPARITY HAS ACTUALLY RISEN FROM 24% TO THIRTY PERCENT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE DESPITE THE BLACK WHITE DISPARITY. IS THE WORST IT HAS EVER BEEN LOOKING AT THE TEN YEAR SNAPSHOT SINCE NINETEEN FORTY. IT'S 30% IS THE LARGEST GAP THE REASON IS BECAUSE- BLACK HOME OWNERSHIP HAS NOT ONLY. NOT INCREASED VERY FAST BUT WHITE HOMEOWNERSHIP HAS INCREASED REMARKABLY SINCE THE POST WORLD WAR TWO. NOW I HAVE THAT I HAVE THE DATA UP FOR CALIFORNIA WHICH YOU JUST MENTIONED THE CALIFORNIA HAS A MUCH LOWER RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP AND INDEED IT DOES. I IN FACT THESE FINDINGS ARE THINK ARE IN MANY WAYS EVEN MORE DISTURBING. SO WE SAW THAT NATIONALLY BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP IS 44% IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S 36% THE LATEST DATA I COULD GET IS FROM THE ACS HERE. THE TWENTY TWENTY- FEDERER'S SERVE DATA IS ACTUALLY AN ESTIMATE SO. I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU AN ESTIMATE HAS TO BE CLEANED UP SO THE TWENTY NINETEEN IS THE MOST RECENT DATA FOR ITS 36% THE DISPARITY. ALMOST AS LARGE AS THE NATIONAL DISPARITY THE BLACK WHITE DISPARITY TONY SEVEN PERCENT. BUT YOU'LL SEE. THAT THE RATE THE ABSOLUTE RATE IS MUCH LOWER. CLOSER TO A THIRD SO THIS IS THIS IS QUITE DISTURBING. BOB THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS OF HOUSING THAT IS RACIALIZED I COULD TALK ABOUT DISPARITIES IN HOME VALUES HOME VALUE APPRECIATION HOME EQUITY IN THE FOR WEALTH. I COULD HAVE SEVERAL SLIDES MY APPENDIX ON THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP IF YOU'RE CURIOUS ABOUT THAT. I COULD TALK ABOUT DISPARITIES IN APPRAISALS DISPARITIES IN PROPERTY TAX ASSESSMENTS AND DELINQUENCIES CREDITS EDIT LOW DIAL SEGREGATION DISCRIMINATION AND STEERING AND MUCH MORE. BUT I WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY TO TALK ABOUT HOMEOWNERSHIP. THERE ARE A BROAD RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE CALLED UPON GOVERNMENT BOTH FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENTS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SUPPORT IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY TO SUPPORT BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP. SO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE POLICIES. THE URBAN INSTITUTE IN THE NATIONAL FAIR HOUSING ALLIANCE HAVE MADE IT THE CENTERPIECE OF THEIR KEYS TO UNLOCK DREAMS INITIATIVE. THEY PROPOSED- THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE WITH THE GOAL OF THREE MILLION NEW BLACK HOMEOWNERS BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE NATIONAL COALITION THE COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION SEVEN EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE GOAL. OF RAISING THAT FORTY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS. A BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE 260% BY TWENTY FORTY. SEVERAL OF PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES LIKE PEOPLE TO CHURCH IN THE DOUGLAS PLAN HAVE ARGUED FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP FUND THAT WOULD TARGET. FAMILIES RESIDING IN FORMALLY REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS ELIZABETH WARREN HAD A SIMILAR INITIATIVE. HOWEVER IF YOU READ THE SCHOLARSHIP NOT EVERYONE IS ENTIRELY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP OF EMORY PROFESSOR AND TAX LAW EXPERT DOROTHY BROWN WHO'S WRITTEN A PHENOMENAL BOOK THE WHITENESS OF WEALTH. CLICK THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP IN AMERICA IS A BAD DEAL FOR MOST BLACK AMERICANS SHE ULTIMATELY CONCLUDES THAT BOB WE SHOULD PROMOTE BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP BUT SHE SAYS BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CABBIE OUGHT TO THAT SPECIFICALLY AGAIN BLACK HOMEOWNERS ENJOY LESS. EQUITY APPRECIATION AND I THINK OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE TO MAXIMIZE EQUITY BLACK HOMEOWNERS PROBABLY HAVE TO PURCHASE HOMES IN WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS SO. THERE'S SOME COMMITTEE TRADE OFFS THERE ON SHE HAS A PHENOMENAL BOOK ON DISPARITIES IN THE TAX CODE BUT LOOK AT- SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN THAT REGARD AS WELL. BOB CAN ALSO OCCUR IN OTHER SCHOLARS ECONOMISTS LIKE SANDY DIRTY POINT OUT EVEN IF DISPARITIES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. DISPARITIES IN HOME EQUITY MEAN THAT THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP WOULD STILL REMAIN OUTSTANDINGLY LARGE. OKAY ONE MORE COPY UP BEFORE SURE SOME POLICIES. SPECIFIC POLICIES ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LITERATURE BETWEEN WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL RACE TARGETED POLICIES VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE RACE CONSCIOUS. TOOK THE MOST DIRECT ROUTE TO PROMOTING BLACK OR MINORITY HOMEOWNERSHIP WOULD BE TARGETED POLICIES TO BLACK FAMILIES THESE ARE POLICIES THAT ADDRESS STRUCTURAL RACISM BY TARGETING PEOPLE ON THE BASIS OF THEIR RACE AND PROVIDING BENEFITS ARE EXTENDING PROTECTIONS ON THAT BASIS. CONTRACT RACE CONSCIOUS POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT ARE DESIGNED FOR RACIAL PURPOSE BUT ARE USUALLY RACE NEUTRAL EITHER UNIVERSALIST TECH OR CLASS BASED IN DESIGNER FORM. THE REASON THAT MANY OF THESE POLICIES ARE RACE CONSCIOUS INSTEAD OF RACE TARGETED BECAUSE FEDERAL LAW AND SOME PARTS OF STATE LAW MEETIC MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO ADOPT REYES TARGETED POLICIES AS A RESULT UNIVERSALIST POLICIES OR PROXIES FOR RACE ARE MORE COMMON. PROPOSITION TWO OH TWO NINE BY THE WAY DOES NOT PROHIBIT THE STATE'S AGING AND IN RACE CAR OR. EVEN RACE TARGETED. A HOUSE IMPULSE. PROPOSITION TWO ONE NIGHT ONLY A TO A- CONTRACT AT. JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT. SO WHAT ARE THE POLICIES TO. PROMOTE HOMEOWNERSHIP AND REDUCE THE RACIAL DISPARITIES WELL ONE DISCOUNTED INTEREST RATES ON MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGES ASSISTANCE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE CLOSING COST INSURANCE ASSISTANT PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENTS AND RELIEF. REPAIRS UPKEEP AND MAINTENANCE ASSISTANCE LAND GRANTS INVESTMENTS IN BLACK OWNED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THE IDEA BEING THAT IF THEY HAVE MORE CAPITAL THEY CAN OFFER. MORE LENDING. BOB A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THEM TO GO THROUGH FOR SPECIFICS AND I'LL BE DONE. SO IN THE BOOK MOVING TO INTEGRATION RICHARD SANDERS CO AUTHORS RICHARD CENTER. TEACHES IN THE UC SYSTEM PROMOTING RACIAL INTEGRATION IN A METRIC MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA. THE COST OF THE PROPOSAL TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION BUT THE ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT FOR YOU HERE. THEY ESTIMATE THAT IT ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INTEREST RATE SUBSIDY ON THE FIRST A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF A MORTGAGE LOAN WOULD COST ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. DOLLARS WHAT HELPING MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND BORROWERS POTENTIALLY FIND HOMES. SO WHILE IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDES UP HOMES AND SUBSIDIES FOR HOMES. INTEREST RATE. SUBSIDIES ARE MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE. FOR EXAMPLES NUMBER ONE OTHER RACE CONSCIOUS HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAM IS THE CLEVELAND RACIAL INTEGRATION INITIATIVE. THIS IS AN OBSCURE PROGRAM FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THE PROVIDED LOW INTEREST MORTGAGE FUNDS FOR BLACK AND WHITE HOMEBUYERS- IT WAS. ADMINISTERED FOR SHORT TIME BY THE OHIO HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY AND TARGET FEW CLEVELAND SUBURBS. AND IT ALL IT MADE MORE THAN THREE MILLION LOANS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE. TO A NUMBER OF WHITE AND BLACK MORTGAGE YOURS. THE CHECK THE PROGRAM WAS CHALLENGED ON LEGAL GROUNDS THAT SURVIVED BUT IT WAS ULTIMATELY DISCONTINUED A FEW YEARS LATER. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE RACE CONSCIOUS HOMEOWNERSHIP PLAN IS A PROGRAM IS THE EVANSTON ILLINOIS REPARATIONS PROGRAM. THIS IS A SUBURB OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO THE CREATED A QUOTABLE REPARATIONS FUND IN TWENTY NINETEEN. ABOUT SHOULD JUST CARRY OUT THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE CRITICIZED THE CITY FOR USING THE TERM REPARATIONS SO I'M JUST BORROWING WHAT THEIR APPELLATION RATHER THAN. HOW SCHOLARS PREFER TO REFER TO THIS.NONETHELESS THEY'VE COLLECTED A TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE THERE GET DISBURSING THROUGH SMALL GRANTS. ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON EITHER PROVING THAT YOUR ANCESTOR WAS A RESIDENT ABOUT IT IN EVANSTON BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN TO NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. OR COULD HAVE BEEN COUNTED HOUSING DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF CITY POLICIES AFTER NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. THE GRANTS DO NOT GO TO INDIVIDUAL HOME SEEKERS TO GO TO BANKS OR BUSINESSES WHO THEN- WHO THAT AND- PROVIDE LOANS TO. HOME SEEKERS AND THIS WAS DONE TO AVOID. INCOME TAX. LIABILITY FOR HOME SEEKERS. AND GRANTS ARE TO USE FOR HOMER MORE ASSISTANCE OR DOWN. THERE TO PROGRAMS OF MASSIVE. THREE BY THE WAY I SHOULD JUST CARRY OUT THAT THERE'S CAL AT EIGHT. IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE LAUNCHED A BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP INITIATIVE BUT IT'S MORE OF A CAMPAIGN. THE DETAILS ARE UNCLEAR TO ME- BUT IT DOES HAVE SOME ELEMENTS APPEAR TO HAVE SOME ELEMENTS THERE SIMILAR TO THESE OTHER TWO PROGRAMS I WOULD IMAGINE. BUT THE CITY BOSTON IN TWENTY TWENTY ADOPTED. THIS PROGRAM THE FIRST GENERATION HOMEBUYER PROGRAM TO PROVIDES. GRANTS OF FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO NEW HOME BUYERS. ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON INCOME- NOT ON RACE. HOWEVER OUT OF THE HUNDRED FIFTY HOME BUYERS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROGRAM. 73% ARE BLACK AND 18% ARE LATINO- THE SECOND PROGRAM A MENTION IS THE ONE PLUS BOSTON PROGRAM THIS IS ANOTHER FIRST TIME HOME BUYER SUBSIDY OF THE CITY OF BOSTON. WITH THE GOAL OF CREATING A THOUSAND NEW HOMEOWNERS BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT OFFERS FIXED THE LOWEST FIXED INTEREST RATES ON A THIRTY YEAR MORTGAGE. SO IT IT. LOWERS THE INTEREST RATE BY EITHER A POINT OR A FULL POINT HALF. BITES OTHER CLOSING COSTS ASSISTANCE AND OTHER EVEN DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON INCOME AS WELL AND RESIDING IN THE CITY LIMITS. BOB I'LL JUST DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION THIS PROJECT IS LAUNCHING TOMORROW. THIS IS CALLED THE STRUCTURAL RACISM REMEDIES PROJECT THIS IS A PROJECT THAT WE'VE BEEN INCUBATING FOR YEAR AND A HALF. AND THERE ARE SPECIFIC POLICIES DRAWN FROM ALMOST SEVENTY SCHOLARLY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS. ON HOUSING THAT ARE BOTH RATES TARGETED IN RACE CONSCIOUS. AND IT HAS ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY RECOMMENDED POLICIES ALONG THE LINES OF JUST MENTIONED. HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THEM IN MORE DETAIL THIS IS THE U. R. L. IT'S GOING TO BE ON OUR WEBSITE TOMORROW BUT THIS IS A PREVIEW FOR YOU HERE. AND THANK YOU FOR GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER. THE NAVY AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID THAT REALLY STRUCK A CHORD AND THEN I'LL PASS IT BACK TO OUR CO CHAIR AND- MEMBERS OF THE DIETS. CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU SAID REGARDING PROP TWO OH NINE. AND HOUSING AS IT RELATES TO- DIVERSITY AND EQUITY IS THIS NOTORIOUS LOG THAT WAS AT NINETEEN NINETY SIX OR NINETY SEVEN BALLOT INITIATIVE. THAT SENSUALLY CREATES A BARRIER TO EXPLICIT CONSIDERATION OF RACE IN PUBLIC POLICY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS HOWEVER. PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE BY ITS OWN TERMS ONLY APPLIES TO CONTRACTING EMPLOYMENT. AND EDUCATION. SO FOR EXAMPLE IT MEANS THAT THE UC SYSTEM'S YOU SEE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA. CANNOT CONSIDERATION SPLIT THAT WE AS A FACTORED ADMISSIONS. OB OR PUBLIC MUNICIPALITIES REPUBLIC AGENCIES CITIES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES CAN'T CONSIDER RACE IN CONTRACTING OR HIGHER. WERE MAKING EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS IT DOES NOT APPLY TO HOUSING TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE STUFF LIKE THAT IT ONLY APPLIES TO CONTRACTING EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION HOWEVER. FORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN INTERPRETED I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT INTERPRETATION BUT THIS IS THE PREVAILING INTERPRETATION THE SUPREME COURT. IS TO ESSENTIALLY. MAKE ALL CLASS RACIAL CLASSIFICATIONS. SUBJECT TO WHAT'S CALLED STRICT SCRUTINY REVIEW. WHICH MEANS THAT ANY TIME THE STATE GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. USES RACE AS AN EXPLICIT. INDIVIDUAL LEVEL CONSIDERATION OF POLICY MAKING FEDERAL COURTS WILL PRESUMPTIVELY. REGARD THAT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL UNLESS IT PASSES WHAT'S CALLED STRICT SCRUTINY REVIEW MEETING THAT HAS TO BE SUPPORTED BY. A COMPELLING GOVERNMENT INTEREST. A NARROWLY TAILORED TO SERVE THAT INTEREST QUESTION ABOUT PROP TWO OH NINE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO HOUSING. THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT APPRECIATED- APPRECIATE THE BACKGROUND HERE- HE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN SORT OF HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU COULD WAVE A MAGIC WAND WHAT YOU THINK IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO TO INCREASE HOMEOWNERSHIP FOR BROWN TO BLACK COMMUNITIES. WELL IT'S HARD FOR ME TO PICK AND CHOOSE BETWEEN THOSE LESS BUT IF THERE WAS ONE SILVER BULLET. AND THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE- IT'S NOT ACTUALLY HOMEOWNERSHIP POLICY WOULD ACTUALLY BE A REPARATIONS POLICY. AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SOMETHING THE STATE COULD DO. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE TO REPARATIONS. BUT THE ONE THING THAT CAN MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF REDUCING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP. IT WOULD BE A FEDERALREPARATIONS POLICY. BECAUSE SHE PUTTING SIGNIFICANT WEALTH INTO UP. INTO BLACK FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE AND THEREFORE IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH EASIER FOR THEM TO AFFORD HOMEOWNERSHIP. BEYOND FEDERAL REPARATIONS POLICY WHICH ISN'T SOMETHING I REALIZE YOU HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO. I THINK THESE POLICIES THAT I MENTIONED TERMS OF INTEREST RATE SUBSIDIES DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. CLOSING COST ASSISTANCE THOSE SORTS OF SUBSIDIES. ACTUALLY HAVE SIGNIFICANT PROMISE. THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T DO IT IN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT IN USING CERTAIN PROXIES LIKE INCOME. WEALTH OR UP. THE RACE THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. SO I THINK ALL OF THOSE HAVE GREAT PROMISE. THANK YOU APPRECIATED AND WILL BRING ABOUT HER TO THE DAIS FOR. ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HERE WHO OF OTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS MISS CLARK SILVA. THANK YOU GREAT INFORMATION. ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT YOU MENTIONED OF COURSE- BLACK INDIVIDUALS ARE LAGGING BEHIND LATINOS BUT I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE DATA. IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SENSE THAT- LATINO- INDIVIDUALS ARE FAR MORE OF THEM- A LARGER POPULATION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ACTUALLY LOOK DIFFERENT WHEN YOU COMPARE- FOR THE NUMBER OF POPULATION IN EACH OF THOSE SUBGROUPS. MEANING THAT IT WILL IT COULD IT LOOKED TO ME AS- LATINOS ARE REALLY ACTUALLY LAGGING BEHIND- OUR BLACK BROTHERS AND SISTERS BECAUSE OF WELL LET ME BE CLEAR IMAGES SHOWED THIS SLIDE AGAIN THIS IS HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA BY RACE THIS IS- THIS IS THESE ARE RATES MEANING THAT THEY ARE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF EACH RACIAL GROUP ALSO ADAM SO WHAT IT SHOWS HERE IS THAT IN CALIFORNIA I THINK AS MEMBER WICKS MENTIONED BEFORE THE TOTAL RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. THE WHITE RATE OF HOMEOWNERSHIP HOUSEHOLDS OWN THEIR OWN HOME IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT RATE IS ONLY MEANING THAT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY RIGHT IT'S ALMOST TWENTY POINTS BEHIND WHITE HOMEOWNERSHIP. NO I GET THAT PART BUT THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE THEY'RE OVER 50% OF THE POPULATION. RIGHT ABSOLUTE NUMBERS THIS IS IT THIS MEANS THAT IT'S A HUGE PERCENTAGE DISPARITY IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IT'S YES YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S PROBABLY A MUCH LARGER ABSOLUTE DISPARITY AND WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE A NUMBER WHERE THEY JUST NOT TRACKING NUMBERS IN THE FORTIES FIFTIES AND SIXTIES FOR LATINOS AND ASIANS. ALL THAT THIS IS THIS IS INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET TOGETHER HAVE A WHOLE TEAM OF RESEARCH SUPPORT HELP ME GET THIS. BOB THE DATA SOURCE HERE IS AYE POEMS- BEFORE TWO THOUSAND AND ITS- DEFENSE SO THE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS BASICALLY BUT YES FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. DID NOT ACTUALLY DISAGGREGATE. DATA INTELLECT LATINO UNTIL NINETEEN EIGHTY AND ASIAN. TILL NINETEEN EIGHTY IT'S IT WAS IT'S VERY HARD TO GET FEDERAL DATA. DISAGGREGATED BY RACE INTO A LATINO AND ASIAN BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY IT ESSENTIALLY DOESN'T EXIST UNFORTUNATELY. THANK YOU THOUGH THE SECRETARY WELL DONE I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES. OKAY I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO OUR CULTURE TO INTRODUCE THE SECOND PANEL. THANK YOU. OUR SECOND PANEL IS ON A STATE OWNERSHIP PROGRAMS AND INCLUDES MR FROM SERVICE MISTER MARTI LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR AND PETER CALDWELL OR THEY ON THE LINE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CAL HFA. YES YES MY NAME IS- FROM SAYS MARTY. CAN WE HIRE HIS VOLUME PLEASE. HELLO CAN YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME. YOU MAY NEED TO SPEAK CLOSER INTO YOUR MICROPHONE THE SOUND A LITTLE FAR AWAY. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES MUCH BETTER. OKAY SHARES WICKS AND COVER YOU KNOW AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FELLOW PANELIST MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. MY NAME IS FRANCES MARTINEZ THE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATION AND POLICY FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY. COLLEGE AFFECT. AND I'M JOINED TODAY BY ALAN MARTIN DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS AND CHERYL HANKS. THE HOUSING FINANCE CHIEF IN A SINGLE FAMILY DIVISION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY I'LL BE PROVIDING SOME THOUGHTS ON THE HOMEOWNERSHIP LANDSCAPE CULTURE FACE ROLE. AND ALSO ON HOW TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUING HOMEOWNERSHIP JOHN. TOOK OUT. RATE OF A HAS DROPPED. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT GRAVEN AND AS JOE WICKS ON THE PREVIOUS. ROUGHLY WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES IN THE- NATION THAT IS IN FACT THE THIRD LOWEST JUST BEHIND. NEW YORK IN THE SAME AND ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP PARTICULARLY FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES IS SEVERELY CHALLENGED BY A RECORD. HIGH HOME PRICES AS REFERENCED BY CHECK OUT TO YOU. DRIVEN BY HIGH DEMAND AND LOW SUPPLY THIS PUSHES EVEN MORE HOUSEHOLD STORES THE RENTAL MARKET WHICH IS SIMILARLY CONSTRAINED. BY LOW SUPPLY AND HIGH PRICES. CHOKING TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE ONGOING SUPPLY DEMAND IMBALANCE IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON HOME PRICES. WHICH MAY PARTIALLY BE. OFFSET BY RISING INTEREST RATES. SO HOW DOES JEFF PHASE ROLE IN THE HOMEOWNERSHIP SPACE IS TO. WE HAVE. FIRST TIME HOME BUYER CULTIVATED A LARGE PROVIDER DUMPING ASSISTANCE THE STATE. AND THEN SECOND WE EXISTING BUYERS THROUGH. ASSISTANCE AND HOW TO COUNSELING BUYER WORK. HOW DO YOU THINK WORKS WITH THE NOW OF LENDERS THAT WORKED DIRECTLY WITH HOMEBUYER. AND HE'S QUALIFIED FOR THE HOME BUYER WE THE FIRST MORTGAGE ALL WITH THE PAYMENTS. IN THE FORM OF A SUPPORT AND ALL MARKET. AND TOUCH BASE MORE DEPENDS ON THE ISSUE FEDERAL CONF. LOANS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO AND MULTI TRILLION SECONDARY MARKET. AND AVOID BALANCE SHEET RISK. CUT TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PRIVATE CAPITAL MARKETS THANKS TO THE WAY WE ARE BUILT WITHIN A TWENTY THIS SELF SUPPORTING. AS HONEST SELF SUPPORTING ENTITY WITH A SEPARATE CREDIT RATING. THE FIRST MORTGAGE BALL ARE BETWEEN TWO ONE FOUR BILLION ANNUALLY DEPENDING ON WHEN WE ARE IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET. MARKET CYCLE AND THESE VOLUMES AND THAT THESE VOLUMES WE ARE ABLE TO HELP BETWEEN SIX THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS A YEAR AGAIN DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ARE IN THE- REAL STATE MARKET CYCLE AND THAT DOESN'T ROBUST TEN PERCENT. OF THE MARKET SHARE STAKEHOLDERS PLAN. AND WE DO THAT I DID. ABOUT A HIGH BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED MILLION. EVERY YEAR CAN STATE SUPPORTIVE STATE SUPPORTED DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. SO THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE LEVERAGING TWENTY PRIVATE DOLLARS FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN STATE. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVER OF WHAT WE DO A COLLEGE OF FATE IS REDRESSING THE PERSISTENT RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND THE LEGACY OF GOVERNMENT SUCH SANCTIONS SYSTEMIC RACIAL SEGREGATION AND HOPPING AND EXPLAINED. IN DETAIL BY. THE PREVIOUS FINALIST WE ARE PROUD THAT SEVEN OUT OF TEN HOUSEHOLDS WE SERVE OUR FROM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR 53% OF OUR BORROWERS A LATINO. HI AND 8% ARE BLACK. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR BORROWERS. HOMES. I PRESENTING OVER A HUNDRED SIX THOUSAND IN ADDITION YOU KNOW EQUITY FOR EACH OF THOSE HOUSEHOLDS WITH HELPED. SO WE KNOW THAT GETTING HOME BUYERS INTO THEIR FIRST HOMES WILL NOT WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IF HOME OWNERSHIP RATES IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO ERODE. THAT IS WHY CALAFATE PROVIDES RESOURCES TO HOMEBUYER EDUCATION AND COUNSELING AND WE EXERCISED SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP AS A MAJOR LESSON OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND A CRISIS. AND WE ALSO JUST LAUNCHED A NEW MORTGAGE RELIEF PROGRAM WHICH HELPS ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS CATCH UP WITH HIM IS MONIES PAYMENTS. BY WE ARE ALL CALLING TECHNOLOGY FACING WORK IS OF WHAT IS NEEDED TO SOLVE THE MASSIVE HOMEOWNERSHIP CHALLENGING CALIFORNIA. AND AS THE LEGISLATURE CONTEMPLATES POSSIBLE POLICY APPROACHES WE WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING THOUGHT. FIRST WEALTH CREATION ANY HOMEOWNERSHIP INTERVENTION MUST CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WEALTH CREATION THROUGH EQUITY GAINS THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO REVERSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP SECOND SUSTAINABILITY HOMEOWNERSHIP SHOULD BE SUSTAINABLE HOME BUYERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN HOMEOWNERSHIP. OVER THE LONGER THIRD SCALABILITY IN ORDER TO FUNCTION ON A SCALE ON AN ONGOING BASIS WE BELIEVE THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MUST BE DELIVERABLE TO THE SECONDARY MARKET AND MUST BE DESIGNED TO LEVERAGE LARGE SUMS OF PRIVATE CAPITAL. IN ADDITION ANY SOLUTION AT SCALE WILL REQUIRE PARTNERSHIPS WITH FEDERAL ENTITY SUCH AS FANNIE MAE FHFA AN FHA. AND THEN LASTLY BUT BUT DEFINITELY NOT LEAST. THE LINE USE AND PERMITTING FOCUS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE ONLINE USE AND PERMITTING INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL INCREASE SUPPLY COMMENSURATE. WITH THE BANK IMPACTS RC AND THIS IS OF COURSE TIED TO THE WORK OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT A TV THAT CONTINUE TO THE END OF THE CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE TO INCREASE LOCAL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATORY CERTAINTY IN THE MARKET. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- WE DO SEE THIS AS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION AND WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH.

AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE MAKE USE OF THE PROGRAM FROM THE SALIENCE OF LOS ANGELES WITH THE BIGGEST TOPIC BEING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. YOUR OTHER COMPONENT OF CAL BUT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS THAT IT HAS ALSO BEEN CRITICAL TO HELP OUR STATE RECOVER FROM DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CAO HOME DISASTER RELIEF PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED A HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN BILLION TO HELP GOING TO HOMEOWNERS REBUILD THEIR HOMES. EACH CITY HAS PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING FOR PARKS IN THE STATE WITH THE MOST STRUCTURES LOST AND JUST A FEW TOP LINE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THAT IS THAT- TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE INVESTED FORTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP WITH WILDFIRE RECOVERY EFFORTS AND- WE EXPECT TO ANNOUNCES AWARDS IN MARCH. AND IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY THE LION SHARING 95% OF HOUSEHOLDS DISASTER RELIEF FUNDING WAS USED TO HELP PAY FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF POST LOST WHAT BUYERS. WITH THIRTY EIGHT MILLION OR 55% OF BACK FROM. THE COUNTY OF BUTTE COUNTY.

THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION CHAIR- DON'T EVEN ASSISTANCE HE'S ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE REAL ESTATE MARKET CYCLE SO- WE ARE CURRENTLY DEPLOYING. THIS SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF FUNDS TO COVER THE DEMAND AND IN ADDITION- WE ARE ALSO. IN THE PROCESS OF STANDING UP- THE NEW COME AND YOU'LL HAVE FINANCIALPRODUCT THAT WILL ADDRESS- HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE ON THE LOWER END OF THE HOME BUYER IN INCOME SPECTRUM AROUND 80% OF A IT MIGHT- WE ARE LOOKING TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER LEVELS OF- DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND OUR CURRENT PROGRAM IN THIS TO YOU- PRODUCT- BECAUSE WE WILL BE SERVING A MORE TARGETED POPULATION WILL ALSO BE LOOKING TO ALLOW. MUCH FASTER EQUITY BUILDING WITH PERHAPS THE DPA OF BECOMING AN GRANT AFTER A FEW YEARS IN THE BORROWER STAYS IN THEIR HOME- BUT OF COURSE WE WILL ALSO BE ON MAINTAINING A STRONG FOCUS ON SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP AS WE ALWAYS DO AND THIS PROGRAM. IS FUNDED. THIS NEW PRODUCT WILL BE FUNDED WITH. EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS PROVIDED INTO IN THE LAST BUDGET- HAS- WEEKS TO LONG SOMETIME AROUND EIGHT. SO MORE DETAILS COME SO THAT IT I CAN THAT IS. THE R. KIND OF FACE. UP TO THE PLANE ON DUMPING ASSISTANCE AND ANY MORE WAY I'LL OPEN IT UP TO CALL ARE. CAN AND ALONG THE HAVE ANYTHING HIDE. THANK YOU FRIENDS- ALLEN MARTIN DIRECT OF THE AND STICK WITH RELATIONS WITH TO AFFECT- YEAH I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE WHAT PRINCESS STARTED WITH WHICH IS THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF OUR MY HOME ASSISTANCE IS REALLY LARGELY DEPENDENT. THE REAL ESTATE CYCLE AND- THE ABILITY FOR OUR HOME BUYERS TO ACCESS HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE- AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES AND HEADWINDS AS I THINK WE ALL KNOW RELATED TO INTEREST RATES AND THE INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT- AS AS WELL AS AS RAPID HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. YEAH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS NEW PRODUCT AND PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION. LET'S SAY YOU'RE AT THE- THAT MY QUESTION IS ALMOST ANSWERED- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WEALTH BUILDING AND HOME EQUITY. IF YOU'RE ENTERING A MARKET WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW- YOU REALLY RUN THE RISK OF HAVING JUST THE OPPOSITE EFFECT YOU CAN DUMP A BUNCH OF MONEY INTO GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOMES THAT THEY LOSE A YEAR LATER- BECAUSE V. TAKE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND NINE. HOUSES WERE UPSIDE DOWN BY AS MUCH AS FIFTY TO SIXTY PERCENT- SHORTLY AFTER- IT WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO OF PEOPLE BUYING THEM AT THE TOP OF THE MARKET. SO WE GIVES PEOPLE THE RENTAL ASSISTANT ARMY IN THE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE NOW AND THEN NEXT THING WE HAD A RECESSION. AND USUALLY IF THEY'RE ON THE LOWER INCOME SPECTRUM THEIR JOBS OR A LOT OF TIMES AT RISK. HOW DO YOU COME TO GRIPS WITH THE- YOU KNOW WHAT THE FOR THE ECONOMIC FALLOUT BECAUSE IT ONCE YOU GO DOWN THAT PATH AND YOU'VE LOST EVERYTHING PEOPLE TO GET BACK SO THAT THE DID THEY JUST DEBTS PREVIOUS PERSON JUST TALK ABOUT MARKET TIMING. AND WHETHER THE THAT WHEN THESE PROGRAMS ARE EFFECTIVE AND THAT'S WHAT THE SOMETHING I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE INTO EFFECT WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF THAT IS WE REALLY HAVE TO. HAVE THESE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE WHEN THEY'RE EFFECTIVE BECAUSE IF THERE'S NO EQUITY TO BUILD THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE A WEALTH BUILDER FOR PEOPLE IT'LL BE A BIRD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I CAN I COULD TAKE A STAB AT ANSWERING THAT- TO. SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF OUR PROGRAMS I CUT TO PAY ANY AND IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS IT IS DEFINITELY A FUNDAMENTAL PILLAR ALL THIS NEW PRODUCT WERE. PLANNING ON LAUNCHING IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- WE DON'T WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHICH IS STILL FULL OF FOCUS NOT JUST ON GETTING HOMEOWNERS IN INCOME IN THE FIRST HOME. BUT ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SO BY OFFERING PRODUCTS KIND ON ALSO INDICATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT WILL EQUIP THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL HOMEOWNERS SO THEY CAN STAY IN THEIR HOME FOR THE LONG TERM. AND I THINK THIS IS THE KEY TO DROOL INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH BUILDING- WE AGREED THAT THE ACCORDING TO OF SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. FORECLOSURE CRISIS WHICH WAS ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATING TOO MANY IMPACTS ON FINANCIAL STABILITY CREDIT AND OVERALL WILL BE OUR FOR ALL OF DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PRODUCTS. ARE PAIRED WITH MORTGAGES THAT ARE FULLY FEDERALLY CONFORMING SO THERE- YOU KNOW FULLY CONFORMING TO FINANCE. XCERRA RULES AND- HELLO MY COLLEAGUES HELLO AND CHERYL SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE. TO THAT ON WHAT FRAN WAS THE ARE UNDER. GUIDELINES ARE FULLY CONFORMING WITH THE GSES WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO PROVIDING THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP PROTECTION- THAT HE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S MENTIONING SO- AGREED THAT THAT SUSTAINABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY FOUNDATIONAL TO THIS ISSUE- AND WE WANT TO BUILD ON LESSONS THAT THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FINANCIAL CRISIS. YEAH IT SEEMS TO ME THE KEY TO THAT IS THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND HOLD A PROPERTY. FOR OVER TEN TO TWENTY YEARS THAT'S WHEN YOU GET YOUR EQUITY BILL THAT. BUT IF YOU CAN'T SURVIVE THE FIRST FIVE OR FIRSTHAND. THEN ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE IN A CYCLE THAT YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF AND YOU KEEP DAMAGING YOUR FINANCES WORSE AND WORSE ALONG THE WAY. SO THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS MAKING SURE IT'S THE TIMING IS RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO HELP PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN SUSTAIN IT. THIS WEEK'S THANK YOU I'M JUST CURIOUS- EIGHT CD IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT HOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE PROP ONE DOLLARS TO FUND CAL HOME ALMOST- DONE IF YOU COULD TALK THROUGH HOW YOU'RE PLANNING ON IT BEING FUNDED THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CHAIR WICKS- OKAY AND YOU ARE RIGHT THAT- CAL HOME IS FUNDED THROUGH ONE DOLLARS WE ARE WE DO HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING BURKE CHIU ADDITIONAL CYCLES- NOTICES OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY AND WE EXPECT- THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM TO RUN OUT IN 200-023-2020 FOUR SO WE DO HAVE SOME BROADWAY THERE- OF COURSE THERE IS THE GENERAL QUESTION OF HOW TO CONTINUE PROMOTING. HOMEOWNERSHIP THROUGH STATE PROGRAMS AND WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU AS FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES TO DIMINISH. THANK YOU. THANK AFFECTS MEASURE- COULD YOU GIVE US OF JUST- HOW MAY. PEOPLE ARE FAMILIES WERE ASSISTED IN. TWENTY TWENTY OR TWENTY NINETEEN I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT YEARS YOU HAVE NUMBERS FOR JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF SCALE AND. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE- COACH A FEW PROGRAMS OR THE TO THE WHOLE OR TO CALL HOME I DON'T THINK WHATEVER. WHATEVER NUMBERS YOU HAVE WATER YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS YOU HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN US A SENSE OF- WHO'S BEEN HELPED. YES ABSOLUTELY SO IN THE LAST EIGHT WITH ARE MY HOME DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WE SHOULD ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS IN THE LAST FISCAL YEAR- AND- HOLD THE FRUIT AND ALL DIFFERENT TO- LIKELY PEDRO AND CALL HOME. BUT I'M JUST GONNA I DID IN MY- STATEMENT EARLIER- JUST KIND OF KNOW THAT ARE ON THE HOME. IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE REAL ESTATE MARKET CYCLE SO DOING AT UP CYCLE- WE COULD SETTLEMENT AS THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIRST HOME BUYERS- PORTANTINO WHEN THE MARKET GOES OFF WE CAN BE ME SIR MAYBE SOME SOME SOME. AROUND SIX THOUSAND SO HILARIOUS BUT MOST RECENT NUMBERS. SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED. I THANK YOU FOR THE CAR CHURCH- OR CAN HOME IN TWENTY NINETY. AND TWENTY TWENTY. WE SERVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOUSEHOLDS- WITH THE PROGRAM WITH A RANGE OF MOTORSHIP PROGRAMS- FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE EXPECT TO HAVE THOSE FIGURES SHORTLY I'M THOSE AWARDS ARE GOING TO BE ANNOUNCED IN EARLY MARCH. AND I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE AND GET THEM TO YOU GOODNESS THANK OKAY THANK YOU- OTHER QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO JUST GENERAL- AVAILABILITY HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED SITUATIONS WHERE DESPITE HAVING A REALLY GOOD APPLE CANTON EVERYTHING'S IN ORDER AND YOU HAVE THE FINANCES AVAILBLE BUT YET THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE THAT COMES IN MAYBE SOME FOREIGN INVESTMENT WITH CASH DOLLARS TO TAKE THAT HOME AWAY FROM. THE A PERSON OR THE FAMILY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SUPPORT. SO I'LL STOP THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CHAIR THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I. I'LL JUST START BY SAYING THAT- OUR PROGRAM LIKE IT DIDN'T IT IN ORDER TO THE TIMELINE THAT WE TO CLOSE ON HOME WITH OUR TEMP ASSIST IS VERY CAN. WITH THE MARKET CHANNEL- SO WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THAT- SPECIFICALLY ABOUT A COMPETITIVE NESTS WITH OF KIND OF. FOREIGN INVESTORS OR OTHER TYPES OF BUYERS HELLO. LET MY COLLEAGUES- COLANGELO TO SEE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMPANY KIND OF ANECDOTAL. AND THAT IN ITSELF BUT- BUT- TO A I'D LIKE TO COME OF REMARK THAT TYPES OF BUYERS IN KIND OF A KIND ARE. THIS IS YOUR LINKS TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY- IN OUR LINE OF BUSINESS WE DEAL DO NOT DEAL WITH CONSUMERS DIRECTLY SO WHEN WE GET THE LOANS THEY HAVE ALREADY GONE THROUGH A LENDING PROCESS AND HAVE BEEN VETTED SO ANY FALLOUT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE WE EVER SEE AT. WHAT ONE MOMENT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY WHAT I'M ASKING SO. I'M ASKING IS YOU HAVE YOU HAVE A PERFECT CANDIDATE YOU HAVE A SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN VETTED. YOU'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF- MAYBE FINDING THE PERFECT HOME. AND THEN THE HOMEOWNER DECIDES TO TAKE THE OFFER FROM. SOMEONE THAT HAS ALL CASH. AND SOMEONE IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY LIKE A FOREIGN INVESTOR. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE SEE QUITE A BIT IN LOS ANGELES I'M I'M CURIOUS IF THAT'S- AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU HAVE. CHERYL CHERYL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF THAT. I HAVE NOT SEEN IN ADELAIDE BUT INSTEAD THAT. I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT IT IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET- I HIGHLY SUPPLY CONSTRAINED MARKET AND SO YOU KNOW ALL BUYERS ARE HAVING TO COMPETE WITH THOSE ALL CASH OFFERS- THAT THAT REALLY. ADDS ADDITIONAL DEMANDS AND CREATES ADDITIONAL SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS IN THE MARKET. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY OUT WE HAVE THE NUMBER QUOTED TO US THAT THEY WERE BENEFICIARIES TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED. AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE WERE ANY RURAL LEE LOCATED HOME BUYERS THAT WERE BENEFITED BY. THAT PROGRAM OR IF RURAL APPLICANTS ARE EVEN ELIGIBLE. WE ARE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION ASSEMBLY MEMBER WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH- YOU KNOW DIGIT GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAM HOW WE DO SEVERAL COUNTIES OF COURSE- AND WE ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PAIRED WITH USDA LOANS I SHALL I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK WITH A LIVE MORE UP. HELLO GUYS AREN'T WE DO I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF OUR BUSINESS IN TEN OF THE FIFTY ACRE COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YEAH IT'S- I'M- SORRY APOLOGIZE AFTER OUR COUNTY SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY- ST BERNARD DINO LOS ANGELES PRINT PRIMARILY IN THE- PALMDALE LANCASTER AREA- CONTRA COSTA STANISLAUS COUNTY. FRESNO COUNTY. ALTHOUGH WE DO WE OFFER THEM OUR PROGRAM IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT WE PRIMARILY TO OUR BUSINESS IN THE- TEN COUNTIES WHICH IS THE SAM THE CENTRAL VALLEY MAJORITY COULD THE INDIRECTLY ANSWERS MY QUESTION I'M I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT GOES AND MY DISTRICT I HAVE AND SPECIALLY IN THE ONE- I'VE BEEN NEWLY ASSIGNED.

THANK YOU SO MUCH IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF THE DIETS WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER THREE WHICH- MY CO CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORKS WILL INTRODUCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OUR FINAL PANEL. CHALLENGES TO INCREASING HOMEOWNERSHIP WE WILL START WITH TASHA HANNEMANN WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE BLACK LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. THAN ONE HERE JEFF SCHROEDER. AS V. P. LAND. PLANNING OPERATIONS AND PONDEROSA HOMES. FELL BY DEBBIE. OUR CALVET EXACTLY DIRECTOR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. M. AND- THOMAS CULLEN SHOP PRESIDENCY OF SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TASHA ARE YOU THERE. M. JOINING US. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE KERN CHAIR REX AND MEMBERS OF THAT COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TASHA HANNEMANN I SERVICE CHIEF OF POLICY- GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR PRC AND DIRECTOR OF THE BLACK LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WHICH WHICH I'M REPRESENTING TODAY I'M THE BLACK LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IS MADE UP OF CALIFORNIA LEADERS FROM VARIED SECTORS THAT SEEKS TO IMPROVE CONDITIONS AND CREATE ECONOMIC PROSPERITY OF BLACK IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS FOUR KEY PILLARS OF HEALTH WEALTH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS- IS THE EDUCATION. POLICY ISSUES WE ARE CURRENTLY RESEARCHING SUPPORTING AND OR ADVOCATING FOR UNDER OUR HOUSING POLITICALLY TO ADVANCE REGIONAL EQUITY EQUITY WITHIN HOMEOWNERSHIP SOME OF WHICH I AM WHAT ARE ALSO IN OUR RECOMMENDATION AND I'LL BE PRESENTING. AND THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. ALL RIGHT. SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE DECLINE IN BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP THREATENS TO EXASPERATION ALREADY QUALITY FOR DECADES TO COME AS HOMEOWNERSHIP REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL WAY MOST FAMILIES AND WORKED IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE'RE HAVING SOME PROBLEMS IN YOUR SCREEN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ON OUR END OR YOURS- JUST- YEAH. THERE'S SOME GREAT BLOCKS IN THE WAY. THE TAXES WERE OKAY AT THIS AGAIN- WE WILL THANK YOU OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE UP THERE BECAUSE UP THERE IT'S BACK YEAH. OKAY WELL MAYBE I WON'T SHARE- I WILL JUST TALK THROUGH THE SLIDE DECK I'M NOT SURE WHY THAT'S HAPPENING- OKAY NOT THAT- ALL RIGHT WELL- AS ALREADY MENTIONED HOMEOWNERSHIP REMAINING A PRINCIPLE WAY MOST FAMILIES BUILD WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY- THE WIRING TO AFFORDABILITY GAP IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN WHITES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR COMMANDS BOLD AND SWEEPING SYSTEMIC REFORMS THAT REDUCE BARRIERS TO OPPORTUNITY WEALTH CREATION SO MUCH MORE- AS ALREADY MENTIONED ALSO CALIFORNIA'S BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE HAS BEEN LOWER THAN IT WAS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHEN THERE WERE. COMPLETELY WHEN IT WAS COMPLETELY LEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST BLACK HOME BUYERS STILL MAJOR BARRIERS THAT CONTINUE TO DEPRESS BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP INCLUDE CREDIT STUDENT LOAN DEBT LACK OF INFORMATION AND RESOURCES FOR FIRST TIME ESPECIALLY FIRST GENERATION HOME BUYERS IT CAN BE EXTREMELY DEFEATING TO BE DENIED MORTGAGE APPROVAL THEREFORE IT IS CRITICAL TO INFORM THESE INDIVIDUALS OF THEIR FINANCIAL OCT. IT'S A HELP OR THEM TAX RISK. IN AFFORDABLE HOME LENDERS AND ENTERED THE HOME BUYER MARKET POST. A COUNSELING CAN ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE DELINQUENCY PREVENTIVE PLACEMENT AND GENTRIFICATION AND PRESERVE WEALTH. THIS IS WHY THE BLC FEELS VERY STRONGLY THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE DELIBERATE ACTION WHICH TARGETS THIS GENERATIONAL ISSUE OF BLACK PEOPLE BEING LOCKED OUT INTO NINE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES. ULTIMATELY OPTING IN ADDRESSING THE HISTORICAL. LEGACY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM. EXCELLENT RESEARCH BY MY STANLEY EQUALIZING BLACK WHITE HOMEOWNERSHIP RATES OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WOULD CREATE MORE THAN FIVE MILLION MORE HOMEOWNERS OF COLOR. GENERATE NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW LONG TERM JOBS AND RAISE UP TO FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUES RELATIVE TO CURRENT TRENDS. AND WHILE SOME POLICY IMPROVEMENTS HAVE LED THE WAY TO ADDRESSING MANY DISPARITIES THAT BLACK AFRICAN AMERICAN INDIVIDUALS FACE WHILE EXPLORING ARE ACCESSING HOMEOWNERSHIP. THERE'S STILL A LONG WAY TO GO AS WE SEEK TO APPLY EQUITY AND PARITY ACROSS ALL COMMUNITIES- SO- SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS- THE FIRST COME FROM A REPORT FROM THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE. SO THAT WOULD BE TO INCREASE SUPPORT FOR SMALL DOLLAR MORTGAGE LOAN PROGRAMS I'M IT IS A PERVASIVE MYTH THAT HOME OWNERS OF LOWER VALUE ARE RISKIER INVESTMENTS FOR MORTGAGES BUT RECENTLY IN ALICE'S FROM THE URBAN INSTITUTE SHOWS THAT. THESE BUYERS ARE COMPATIBLE CREDIT SCORES AND THEIR MORTGAGES HAVE SIMILAR LOAN TO VALUE RATIOS TO MORE VALUABLE PROPERTIES AS HOMES IN BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ALREADY DEVALUED THIS BARRIER TO ENTRY TO HOMEOWNERSHIP DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS BLACK BUYERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS- ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO REDUCE UNEVEN COST OF MORTGAGES FOR BLACK HOMEOWNERS I'M HOMEOWNERSHIP WHILE BLACK IS EXPENSIVE. CREATING A RATE AND TERM REFINANCE OPTION WOULD HELP MORE HOUSEHOLDS REDUCE MONTHLY MORTGAGE COSTS AND LOWER. THE BARRIERS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP. EXISTE CREDIT AND DOWN IS TO BORROWERS IMPACTED Y DISCRIMINATORY HOUSING AND LENDING PRACTICES HISTORICAL AND ONGOING POLICIES SUCH AS REDLINING RESTRICTS THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT STEERING. ANYMORE ARE HAVE EXTRACTED WELL FROM BLACKLEY FOR GENERATIONS AND WHILE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY EXTEND CREDIT BASED ON REDLINING MAPS DRAWN IN THE NEW DEAL ERA. PAST INJUSTICES MUST BE REDRESSED BY HELPING TO DEVELOP AREAS LEFT BEHIND BY RACES POLICIES. ADULT CREDIT SCORING PRACTICES WITH LESS DISCRIMINATORY DISCRIMINATORY IMPACTS CURRENT METRICS THE CREDIT SCORING DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR REGULAR PAYMENTS FROM RENT AND UTILITIES INSTEAD THEY PRIORITIZE LOAN AND CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS. EXPANDING THE CHINS OF CREDIT BUILDING CAN DISPEL THE MYTH THAT BLACK HOMEOWNERS ARE RISKY INVESTMENTS. INCREASE DIVERSITY IN THE APPRAISAL PROFESSION NEARLY NINE OF TEN PROPERTY APPRAISALS ARE. ARE PRAZERES SKEWS ME ARE WHITE WHILE 2% ARE BLACK HI THIS IS ACCORDING TO URBAN INSTITUTE ANALYSIS IN TWENTY NINETEEN CENSUS DATA. WITH DEMOCRATS INSTANCE OF APPRAISER BIAS MAKING HEADLINES ON A CONSTANT BASIS BETTER REPRESENTATION IN THE PROFESSION- HOLD SWAY OVER AT THE MY MUCH OF THE VALIDATION PROCESS AND CAN GO A LONG WAY. MORE RECENTLY- I PERSONALLY MY PARTNER WHO'S A BLACK MALE PURCHASED A HOME LAST YEAR HE- GOT HIS HOUSE THE BASE LAST YEAR AND HE DID NOT. SHOW UP TO THE APPRAISAL HE INSTEAD ASKED HIS WHITE REALIST HER TO ATTEND ON HIS BEHALF BECAUSE HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE BIAS THAT HE MADE OR DISCRIMINATION THAT HE MIGHT FACE IN THAT PROCESS AND WE'VE HEARD THIS FROM MANY MEMBERS AFTER- THE BLC JUST DISCRIMINATORY- EXPERIENCES THAT THEY'VE HAD IN ATTAINING- PHONES. AND SO. WHEN I SING BIAS YOU KNOW IT'S MORE THAN JUST REQUIRING A TRAINING WHICH IS A GREAT FIRST STEP BUT WE HAVE TO CONSIDER MORE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. ARE PERHAPS THERE'S A HOTLINE WHERE BIAS INCIDENCES COULD BEREPORTED OR MORE PERSONAL LIABILITY IF YOUR APPRAISAL WAS FOUND TO BE INDEED. ONE OF THE HIGHEST AT THERE MAY PERHAPS MAYBE. A FINE OR PENALTY TO BE CONSIDERED- AND THEN LAST. BROUGH RECOMMEND THAT CONTINUES. AND RELIEF EFFORTS FOR HOME OWNERS AND BUYERS IN THE WAKE OF CARPET NINETEEN SO WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC EXASPERATED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR MANY AUNTS ADAM. AND THEN THERE'S A FEW ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS I'LL JUST MENTION IN THERE LOOK A BIT TOO TOOK A TOUR OF OUR FRIENDS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY HERE ON THE LINE AND THEY MAY SPEAK TO THEM BUT THEY ARE LINED WITH THE BOC'S AGENDA. AS WELL AS BROOKINGS AND THAT'S JUST AGAIN INVESTING IN AFFORDABLE HOW NUMBER OWNERSHIP INCREASING ACCESS TO DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE AND INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE CREDIT. LAST I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN SEVERAL FAIR HOUSING AND EQUITY BILLS BUT ALSO ALIGNED WITH OUR POLICY AGENDA- SO REQUIRING CALIFORNIA REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING IS ONE OF THEIRS AS WELL. REMOVING DISCRIMINATORY LANGUAGE AND PROPERTY RECORDS PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE LIVING IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. REPEAL ARTICLE THIRTY FOUR OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AND BOOST HOUSING CONSTRUCTION SO HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ACCESSIBLE TO ON. SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I'M THRILLED TO NOTE SLEGERS FOCUSING ON THIS- TO GET THE BLACK AND AYE PART COMMUNITIES ON LEVEL FOOTING TO HOMEOWNERSHIP ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A HISTORIC BUDGET SURPLUS TO SUPPORT AS MANY FAMILIES ON THE PATH. TO SELF SUFFICIENCY AS POSSIBLE IN THIS CAN'T HAPPEN WITHOUT TAKING INTENTIONAL ACTION TO CREATE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS FOR EVERYONE SO IT'S FOR OUR FAMILY THAT'S RIGHT FOR THE ECONOMY AND IT'S RIGHT FOR OUR FUTURE. IN THE BILL SEEKS TO BE HAPPY TO PARTNER IN ANYWAY IN SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS SO I HOPE TO REMAIN IN TOUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS ADMIN APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND YOUR PERSONAL STORY AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE- A PARTNER WENT THROUGH THAT- BUT IF WE SHOULD BE SHARING THAT WITH US. UP NEXT WHERE FROM- MISTER AT JEFF SCHROEDER. AFTERNOON SHARES CARILLO AND WICKS IN MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING COMMITTEE AND BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT CBI A AND HOME BUILDERS ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE MY NAME IS JEFF STRAIGHTER AND VICE CHAIR OF CIA AND SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF LAND PLANNING OPERATIONS FOR PONDEROSA HOMES WE ARE A BAY AREA BASED HOMEBUILDER AND CURRENTLY HAVE PROJECTS IN THE BAY AREA THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. PROBABLY NO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN UNDER BUILDING HOUSES FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THIS WHICH EXISTED PRIOR TO COPE WITH. WHICH HAS MADE THINGS WORSE MY FOCUS ON IS ON THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. STATE AND LOCAL POLICIES WHICH HAVE. IN CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE THE HOUSING CRISIS. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WE ARE IN A PROLONGED HOUSING CRISIS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT RELIEF IN SIGHT. IN MY THIRTY THREE YEARS IN THIS BUSINESS. IT'S NEVER BEEN HARDER TO BUILD HOUSING. SO WHAT CAN YOU IS LEGISLATORS DUE TO HELP SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. NUMBER ONE DO NO HARM IT SHOULD BE PARAMOUNT THAT NO NEW LEGISLATION IS PASSED THAT MAKES IT HARDER TO SUPPLY HOUSING. A RECENT ASSEMBLY SEQUEL BILL IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT SIMPLIFICATION CAUSES UNNECESSARY DELAYS AND ADDS TO THE COST OF HOUSING OFTEN FOR NO REAL BENEFIT. REGULATIONS CONTINUE TO BE PROMULGATED WHICH ADD TO THE COST OF HOUSING. THOSE REVISIONS TO THE WATER BOARD'S CONSTRUCTION GENERAL PERMIT INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS BY CC WILL ADD THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER UNIT HOUSING COSTS. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. WELL WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULATIONS PERHAPS WE SHOULD RECONSIDER THE VALUE OF ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS DURING THIS HOUSING CRISIS. ONE POSSIBLE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO ENACT LEGISLATION WHICH DELAYS NEW REGULATIONS FOR TEN YEARS. NUMBER TWO IT'S ALL ABOUT SUPPLY RESTRICTIVE LAND USE POLICIES AND A BIAS AGAINST TRADITIONAL SUBURBAN HOUSING HAVE DRIVEN LANDED HOUSING PRICES THROUGH THE ROOF. MANY SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES RESIST GRANTING ENTITLEMENTS FOR HOUSING TO ACCOMMODATE COMPUTERS FROM JOBCENTRE COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE ALSO UNWILLING TO ALLOW ADEQUATE HOUSING. URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES RESTRICT LAND SUPPLY AND REYES LAND PRICES. AS WE PUSH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO INCLUDE MORE HOUSING WITHIN CITY LIMITS LOCAL COMMUNITIES REVOLT AND NOW WE HAVE PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURES THAT COULD ELIMINATE STATE HOUSING MANDATES. ONE SOLUTION MIGHT BE LEGISLATION THAT ELIMINATES URBAN GROWTH BOUNDARIES OR REQUIRE THEM TO BE ADJUSTED BY ANNUALLY TO MEET NEEDED HOUSING PRODUCTION. WE ALSO NEED ADULT SUPERVISION OVER LOCAL CONTROL. IF WE RELY LOCAL CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ALLOCATE LAND FOR NEEDED HOUSING THEIR SELF INTEREST WILL NEVER DELIVER SIGNIFICANT NEW SUPPLY. THERE HAS TO BE A STATE REGIONAL OVERSIGHT PROCESS WHICH ALLOWS BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS TO OVERRIDE LOCAL LEGISLATIVE ACTS BUT WE WILL NEVER SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS. STATE LEGISLATION LIKE READ THE RIDEAU PROCESS SB NINE SB TEN THE WHAT WELL INTENTIONED ARE FORCING LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ACCEPT GROWTH ALLOCATIONS. THEY ARE RELATIVELY THE MINIMA SOLUTIONS AND SUBJECT TO USE. STATE POLICIES FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING WITHIN THE URBAN FOOTPRINT IGNORE MARKET FORCES. FOR THE PANDEMIC DEMOGRAPHERS NOTED THE TRANSITION FROM URBAN TO SUBURBAN AND RURAL DESTINATIONS AND THE PANDEMIC ACCELERATED THIS TREND. ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF BUYERS ARE INTERESTED IN HIGH DENSITY HOUSING AND THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE TYPE OF HOUSING WE BUILT. OUR MARKET EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FAMILIES WANT SINGLE FAMILY HOMES AND THEY'RE DRIVING FURTHER TO GET THEM WE'RE LEAVING THE STATE ENTIRELY. WE CANNOT CONSERVE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS PROBLEM WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO PRESS LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO ACCEPT MORE DENSITY AND DIVERSITY. BUT REMEMBER WHERE EXACTLY WE ARE ASKING EXISTING COMMUNITY TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS INVESTMENT IN NEW COMMUNITIES THAT PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE IN. SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE HOMES CAN BE AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN. DEVELOPERS CAN BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LESS DENSE CONFIGURATIONS WINDSCALE LOW OUT ONE THOUSAND UNITS AND I WILL GIVE YOU ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED AFFORDABLE HOMES OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT HAVE TO BE FAR FLUNG CONVERSELY THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHICH WOULD BE CONSIDERED INFILL. FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF NEW HOUSING CAN BE BUILT. DESIGNATE NEW STATE SPONSORED PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT AREAS WITH STATE LEVEL JURISDICTIONS CIRCUMVENT LOCAL CONTROL AND HOUSING SUPPLY SUPPRESSION. CREATE NEW FRANK FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING POTENTIAL PROPERTY TAX ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP FINANCE AND MAINTAIN NEW INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S TIME TO TAKE BOLD ACTION IF WE ARE TRULY TO ADDRESS THE HOUSING CRISIS. DO NO HARM THE INTO LEGISLATION REGULATION THAT THE LAYS SUPPLY AND INCREASES COSTS. REFORM LOCAL CONTROL WITH REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE OVERSIGHT AND APPEALS PROCESSES TO INCREASE SUPPLY. INVESTED NEW SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES TO ALLOW MARKET MARKET FORCES TO DELIVER THE HOUSING MADE BY ALL CALIFORNIANS. WITHOUT SOLUTIONS LIKE THESE STATE HOUSING POLICY WILL NOT OF THIS CRISIS I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS DISCUSSION- AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE ANY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SCHROEDER NEXT WE HEAR FROM DEBBIE ORACLE WHOSE EXEC DIRECTOR OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY. W. THEIR- YES I AM GREAT GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS PANEL I REPRESENT THE COALITION OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE NONPROFIT HOMEBUILDERS ADVANCING HOMEOWNERSHIP WITH LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND WE BUILD MULTI FAMILY MULTI LEVEL OF HIGH DENSITY OWNERSHIP DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS SINGLE FAMILY AND JUST A REMINDER OF WHO WE SERVE WE SERVE LOWER INCOME UP 280% AND MY WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS UP TO MODERATE WE SERVE BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND IMPACT 80% OF HABITAT HOME HOME BUYERS ARE BLACK AND BROWN HOUSEHOLDS WE SERVE OLDER ADULTS AND VETERANS THERE'S AN URGENT NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP PRODUCTION TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY CALIFORNIA'S BEEN IGNORING THE OWNERSHIP MODEL FOR DECADES AND NOW THE FUNDING IS ACTUALLY THERE BUT THE WILL IS NOT INVESTING IN HOMEOWNERSHIP PROVIDES A PATHWAY TO STABILITY AND EQUITY. AND WE SEE THREE KEY LEADERSHIP ACTIONS FIRST TO ADDRESS THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP WELL AND INVESTED OWNERSHIP PROTECTION WE NEED TO STOP THE DECADES LONG SHORTAGE OF FUNDING THERE'S A FAILURE AND IN SOME CASES AN ACTUAL REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE THAT AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP MODEL EFFECTIVELY AND PERMANENTLY ADDRESSES OUR HOUSING NEEDS CALIFORNIA HAS THE MONEY AND WITH THE SURPLUS AND BILLIONS OF FEDERAL FUNDS INFUSED INTO CALIFORNIA YES MEMBERSHIP PRODUCTION WAS ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF THE STATE BUDGET AND ENTIRELY LEFT OUT OF STATE ALLOCATED ARPA. FUNDS FOR PRODUCTION. SECONDLY WE NEED TO PROMOTE THE STRONG RETURN ON INVESTMENT BENEFITS OF CALIFORNIA DOLLARS IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS WITH THE AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP MODEL. AND THIRD WE NEED TO ENSURE A LONG TERM COMPREHENSIVE AND EQUITABLE APPROACH TO CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SOLUTIONS WE NEED TO SOLVE FOR THE SHORT AND THE LONG TERM HOUSING NEEDS WITHIN PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDES OF COURSE TRANSITIONAL EMERGENCY HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO ARE AND HOUSE. AFFORDABLE RENTAL AND AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP IT'S A YES AND TO MEET ALL OF OUR NEEDS NOT AN EITHER OR AND THERE'S A COST TO DOING NOTHING THE LACK OF FUNDING MEANS OWNERSHIP UNITS DO NOT GET BUILT THIS KEEPS OUR SUPPLY LOW. IT KEEPS OWNERSHIP RATES DOWN AND WE NEED TO STOP PERPETUATED THE WEALTH IN EQUITY AND THE RACIAL INEQUITY CAUSED BY DENYING THAT LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. ACCESS TO OWNERSHIP IF YOU'RE LOW INCOME YOU MIGHT GET SOME HELP WITH RENTAL BUT WE WON'T HELP YOU GET AHEAD. SO TOGETHER WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT AS WE NEED TO SOLVE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE BY INCLUDING. AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP MODELS AND I'M GONNA DO A QUICK SHARE ABOUT THE CAL HOME PROGRAM THAT WE HAD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EARLIER. EUGENE'S. OKAY JUST CONFIRMING THAT THEY REALLY CAN SEE THIS THOUGH THE CALLUM IS V. OWNERSHIP PROGRAM MEANING IT IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT NONPROFITS CAN ACCESS TO GET PRE CONSTRUCTION DOLLARS AND ACTUALLY INCREASE PRODUCTION AS WE HEARD IT'S UNDERFUNDED AND OVERSUBSCRIBED AND- GOOD NEWS WE HAVE HEARD WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS EXPIRING AFTER THIS YEAR AND IT SOUNDS LIKE- THERE MIGHT BE FUNDING FOR ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR BUT EITHER WAY IT IS RUNNING OUT. FOR IT THE FIVE PREVIOUS YEARS FUNDING AT ALL PROP ONE FUNDS WERE DEPLETED AND THERE WAS NO OPTION FOR OWNERSHIP PRODUCTION WHATSOEVER WITH NEW PROP ONE MODEST FUNDING WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL YEARS OF FUNDING TO THE OFFICE BUT THERE'S NO REPLACEMENT FUNDING SO WE JUST HAVE A GLANCE- YOU CAN SEE THE LAST THREE YEARS OF NO FIVE THE AMOUNT THAT WAS MADE AVAILABLE SO BETWEEN FIFTY SEVEN AND SIXTY ONE MILLION THE AMOUNT REQUESTED. OUR OUR EXCEEDS THAT AND THEN IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SHORTFALL IS OVERALL AND WE'RE LOOKING AT CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION- AND THEN THE FOLLOWING YEAR ALMOST A HUNDRED MILLION AND THEN ALMOST SEVENTY MILLION SO THOSE ARE UNITS THAT ARE NOT BEING BUILT AND JUST SPEAKING FOR HABITAT WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF SHOVEL READY PROJECTS THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO IF. THERE WASN'T AN INVESTMENT. SO ALL AND I'LL CONTINUE CARE WITH EMPHASIZING THAT THE OWNERSHIP INVESTMENT PAYS OFF CALIFORNIA JUST JUST YOU KNOW THERE'S LIKE A GREY BOX OVER YOUR PRESENTATION FOR SOME REASON. OKAY LET ME SEE IF I OTHER YOU GO- IT IS BACK. IT MIGHT BE ON OUR SIDE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S- THE OTHER. YEAH SOME ARE AND SOME ARE BOB UNDER OUR IT ANYBODY IF YOU COULD EVER REALLY TALK THROUGH. WHAT YOU HEARD ME MENTION OKAY IT SEEMS TO BE FINE. THIS I HAVE YOU'RE YOU'RE GOOD NOW. OKAY JERRY IT AGAIN OR A DON'T KNOW. YES WERE WONDER YEAH I KNOW THE TEAM HAS A COPY OF IT IT MAYBE I CAN GET THE THERE TO SHARE WITH OUR- YEAH IF YOU WANT HAVE YOU HAVE YOUR FOLKS AND TO US. WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IT I APOLOGIZE. YEAH NO THAT'S OKAY THAT'S OKAY. OKAY SO DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO SHOW THIS TO L. HOW OF SUBSCRIBE AND UNDER FUND WHICH- THAT THE FEWER UNITS THAT WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE. AND THE SECOND KEY OPPONENT AT ELEMENT OF THE OWNERSHIP MODEL IS THAT IT'S A SINGLE ONE TIME INVESTMENT BY GOVERNMENT ENTITY CHEATS MULTIPLE GOALS SO. IT ALLOWS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE RATE OF OWNERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO BOOST AND HELPS CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP GAP AND HELP ADDRESS DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AND IT ENABLES THE FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. AND VERY QUICKLY AND SURE AS LONG TERM PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK BY INCREASING THE SUPPLY AND INCREASING HOME PRODUCTION WITH HOME CONNECTION BEING THE NUMBER ONE WAY TO COMBAT INFLATION. SO WHAT I WHAT I WANTED TO TOUCH ON IS WHAT THE HOMEOWNERSHIP FUNDING STACK WHAT THAT MODEL LOOKS LIKE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE. YOU HAVE A HAND OUT SO- I RELUCTANTLY SHARES THE BRAIN- I COULD TRY IT. ALL RIGHT LET ME KNOW IF THAT WAS FAULTY BUT IF WE LOOK HERE THIS IS ON THE HABITAT MODEL- AGAIN THIS RANGES FOR ACTUAL COST THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT THE HOME PRICES FOR SEVENTY FIVE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FUNDING SOURCES THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IS THE ACTUAL HOMEOWNER LOAN SO THIS IS THE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS THAT IS MAKING UNAFFORDABLE NO MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME TOWARD. AN AFFORDABLE MORTGAGE AND THEN WERE ABLE TO LEVERAGE WITH PRIVATE FUNDRAISING DOLLARS IN SOME CASES WE ARE ABLE TO USE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE DOWN PAYMENT ASSISTANCE IS A GREAT PROGRAM BUT IT'S WORTHLESS IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPLY WE NEED THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO APPLY IT. AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING THAT MIGHT BE THE CALHOUN PROGRAM BUT AGAIN THAT'S A SEGMENT OF THIS THAT IS THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT AND THEN THE AFFORD BETTER AFFORDABILITY RESELL RESTRICTIONS APPLY MAKING SURE THAT. THE STAYS WITHIN THE AFFORDABLE COOL. FOR I YOU THIS IS MEMBER SHARON SO HAVOC ON THE THAT THAT RESALE RESTRICTIONS WHAT ARE THOSE EXACTLY AND I UNDERSTAND KEEPING THIS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING POOL BUT HOW DOES THAT THEN WORK AS FAR AS WEALTH GENERATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL HABITAT OWNER. YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO WITH THAT HABITAT SALES AGREEMENTS WE HAVE THE FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL SO TYPICALLY- IDEALLY HABITAT WOULD RE PURCHASE AND THEN WE WOULD MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO ANOTHER QUALIFIED LOWER INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS IT HABITAT FOR SOME REASON DID NOT REPURCHASE THERE STILL AN AFFORDABILITY RESTRICTION THAT ALLOWS THE ORIGINAL OWNER TO BUILD MODEST EQUITY SO THEY ARE EARNING EQUITY BUT THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO FLIP IT WITH THE EQUITY THAT. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET A WINDFALL PROFIT SO THERE'S A SHARED AGREEMENT THAT IS SPELLED OUT AT THE VERY BIG EARLY ON DURING THE QUALIFICATION THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS AND THE INTENTION LIKE I SAID IS TO BUILD MODEST EQUITY. A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS ARE THEN ABLE TO SAVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THAT LOCKED IN MORTGAGE AND ARE ABLE TO MOVE INTO MARKET RATE HOUSING. THANK YOU. AND IF YOU WANTED TO WRAP UP. OKAY HAPPY TO WRAP UP- JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY SAY THAT THE AFFORDABLE OWNERSHIP MODEL DOESN'T JUST SOUND THAT WE HAVE DECADES OF EVIDENCE- ESPECIALLY DURING THAT THE PANDEMIC THERE'S COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT ONLY 7% OF HABITAT MORTGAGE HOLDERS WERE LAID ON THE MORTGAGE AND ZERO WERE AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. SO WE REALLY ARE ENCOURAGING YOUR SHIP TO INVEST IN AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP PRODUCTION MAX MIGHT STATE HOUSING INVESTMENTS AND HABITAT IS HERE AS A PARTNER WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER TO HELP SOLVE THIS CRISIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND ROLLING WITH SOME OF THE TECH CHALLENGES THERE- NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TOM MCCALL AND SHOP PRESIDENCY OF SELF HELP ENTERPRISES TOM EITHER WEIGHT SIX OH COMMITTEE MEMBERS WORKING SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. TO CREATE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES- WE DO THAT IN THREE DISTINCT STRATEGIES. BOB FIRST IS WE HAVE AN ACTIVE MUTUAL SELF HELP HOUSING PROGRAM- AND THAT'S WHERE FAMILIES BUILD THEIR OWN HOMES WITH OUR HELP- THEY HELP EACH OTHER AS WELL WE BILL TEN HOMES AT A TIME AND THE WAY IT WORKS IS THAT ALL HOME START. THE SAME DAY. BUT NOBODY MOVES UNTIL A TENER DONE SO IT'S REALLY THAT SHARED LABOR. THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. THE SECOND STRATEGY IS WE WORK WITH A NUMBER OF US CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THE VALLEY. TO HELP THEM OPERATE HOMEBUYER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH A VARIETY OF STATE AND FEDERAL- SOURCES. AND THE THIRD THING THAT WE DO IS WE PROVIDE HOMEBUYER EDUCATION CREDIT COUNSELING- AND LINKAGES TO OTHER KINDS OF SUBSIDY PROGRAMS. LIKE SOME THAT WERE MENTIONED TODAY. BOB ALL TOLD WE'VE- OVER TEN. FAMILIES THROUGH THAT- THOSE THREE STRATEGIES- ABOUT SIXTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THOSE- ART THROUGH OUR SELF HELP HOUSING PROGRAMS THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN- STABLE PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES- WITH WEALTH BUILDING OUTCOMES- AND- PREDOMINATELY- BY FAR AND AWAY. OF PEOPLE OF COLOR WELL OVER 80% OF THE FAMILIES WHO PARTICIPATED IN OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN CUT PEOPLE OF COLOR MOST MANY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FARMWORKERS. OF LATINO DESCENT. WITH COSTS IN HOME ABOUT VALUES AND BY NEARLY 30% IN JUST THE PAST YEAR AND SOME OF OUR MARKETS. THE GAP. FOR FAMILIES TRYING TO ACHIEVE HOMEOWNERSHIP LOW INCOME FAMILIES IS INCREASING. UP FOR PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE IN PROCESS WE CAN KEEP PRICES LOWER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A PROFIT MOTIVE- IT IN THE SELF HELP PROGRAM THE BULK OF THE LABOR IS PROVIDED THROUGH SWEAT EQUITY SO SOME OF THE LABOR INCREASES WE DON'T HAVE TO BEAR. UP BUT THERE ARE STILL MAJOR GAPS AND SO WITHOUT RE. REHASHING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH FROM- MY HABITAT COUNTERPART I WILL MENTION A COUPLE OF A PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE FAIRLY SPECIFIC IN NATURE THAT WOULD REALLY HELP US DELIVER- THESE THESE PROGRAMS TO MORE. DESERVING HOMEBUYERS. FIRST CAL HOME FOR PROGRAM HAS BEEN TO ABOUT LOT. BUT IT CERTAINLY IS THE BEST TOOL THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN DEVISED BY THE STATE TO ASSIST LOW INCOME. HOMEBUYERS BOB BUT FIRST THE COMPETITION FOR FUNDS NEEDS TO USE MORE GRANULAR DATA. HAS AS A BASIC METRIC AND NOT COUNTY WHAT DATA. MAKES DIFFICULT FOR SOME SMALL CITIES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY FOR FUNDS. SECONDLY WE NEED TO MAKE A PROGRAM COMPATIBLE WITH PRIMARY MORTGAGE PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FIVE A TO DIRECT MORTGAGE PROGRAM WHICH WE USE EXTENSIVELY HERSELF UP HOUSING PROGRAM- THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS THAT. FRANKLY THE STATE DOES NOT NEED TO APPLY THAT COULD ALLOW THE USDA- OF METRICS TO GOVERN. OUR THIRD CALLUM PRO FUNDING NEEDS TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE INCLUDING ALLOWING FOR VERTICAL CONSTRUCTION COSTS- IN RECENT- NOTICES OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN ALLOWED WHAT IT HAS BEEN IN PAST CYCLES. AND LASTLY THERE NEEDS TO BE ONGOING FLEXIBILITY OF THE LOAN AMOUNTS THAT ARE NEEDED THAT CAN BE RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS. A WORD ABOUT FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT- ARE PASSED THROUGH THE STATE. DEPARTMENT HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- BOB AND LOCAL GUIDELINES SHOULD SHOULD BE FLEXIBLE AS LONG AS THEY CONFORM TO THE REGULATIONS AND NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND I'M MOSTLY REFERRING TO THE HOME AND CDBG PROGRAMS WHICH CAN ALSO BE. CRITICAL ASSISTANCE FOR FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS. BOB ALSO STATE PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT DISCOURAGE SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERSHIP. SIMPLY BY THE WAY THEY ARE- THEY THEY ARE ROLLED OUT. CURRENTLY BOTH THE INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ARE ESSENTIALLY NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR MOST HOMEOWNERSHIP PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF MINIMUM DENSITY REQUIREMENTS BUT WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF DENSITY WE OURSELVES HAVE. BEEN ACTIVE- PARTICIPANTS IN IN UTILIZING DENSITY BONUSES AND ALL OF OUR SINGLE FAMILY SUBDIVISION- IT IT IT SHOULD NOT PRECLUDE HOMEOWNERSHIP ARE PROJECTS FOR BIG TWENTY. ALSO JUST DON'T WORK TELL HFA USED TO PROVIDE PREFERRED MORTGAGE FINANCING FOR OUR SELF HELP HOME BUILDERS IN AREAS THAT WE'RE USDA FUNDING IS NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF ELIGIBILITY. IF THEY DID THROUGH GREAT FORWARD- FORWARD COMMITMENT PROGRAS THAT REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF VULNERABILITY DURING THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION FOR HOME BUILDERS. THEY NEED TO DO THIS PROGRAM AGAIN IT HAS NOT BEEN AROUND FOR AT LEAST. TWELVE YEARS. SINCE THE RECESSION. TELOGEN PHASE ALSO MANAGED A GREAT PROGRAM IT WAS THE SCHOOL FEES REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM- WHEN THEY GOT FUNDING THROUGH SOME EARLIER BOND ISSUE- ISSUES TO- TO OFFSET THE COSTS THAT HELP THOUSANDS OF FIRST TIME HOME BUYERS. WHICH ALSO NEEDS TO BE FUNDED AGAIN THE IRONY IS THAT THE POOREST RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE OFTEN AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST SCHOOL IMPACT FEES. WHICH BECOMES A MISMATCH FOR LOCAL HOME VALUES. MY ORGANIZATION DOES IT SHARE OF RENTAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AS WELL FOR LOW INCOME AND ON HOUSE RESIDENTS. SO WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP NEEDS TO BE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR HOUSING DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL. IN ORDER FOR US. BOB I WOULD ALSO JUST ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASKED RECENTLY WE DO SEE PEOPLE. LOW INCOME HOPE PERSPECTIVE HOME BUYERS LOSE OUT TO ALL CASH OFFERS WE SEE IT ALL THE TIME- ANDERS WE HAVE FUNDS THAT WE PREPARE FAMILIES TO PURCHASE HOMES. WITH THE HOMES ARE JUST NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT MARKET SO I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR EVERYONE ON THE PANEL I'LL BRING IT BACK HERE TO MY COLLEAGUES ON ANY QUESTIONS FOR ANYONE THE PANEL MR COLOR. YOU HAD A QUESTION OKAY. OKAY YES QUIZZICAL INDEED MISS CLARK SILVA. SORRY TO BE THE QUESTION ASKER HERE TODAY BUT I AM- I HAVE ONE ACTUALLY FOR ON THE IMPACT FEES WHAT YOU JUST SAID THE POOREST AREAS OFTEN HAVE CAN HAVE THE HIGHEST IN P. IMPACT FEES CAN YOU EXPECT. EXPAND YEAH I WAS I WAS YOU CANNOT. I WAS SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO US SCHOOL IMPACT FEES AND THE WAY THIS THE STATE PROGRAM OPERATES IS THAT. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT PASSED AND CANNOT PASS LOCAL BOND MEASURES TEND TO HAVE. THEY ALLOW THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO IMPOSE HIGHER IMPACT FEES. FOR SCHOOLS AND THAT THERE WAS A GREAT PROGRAM THAT KELLY TO PAY RAN THAT- COULD OFFSET THOSE COSTS BECAUSE WE SEE HIGHER SCHOOL IMPACT FEES IN RURAL AREAS. IN ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER IMPACT FEES ARE HUGE I CAME FROM A LOCAL CITY APPEAL GRILL I WAS R. FIFTEEN YEARS THE COUNCIL AND KNEW MY COLLEAGUES WHILE LOCAL CITY COUNCILS IN THE IMPACT FEES ARE A BIG SCHOOLS SEWER SO STORM DRAIN PARKS I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEES AND SOME THESE ISSUES. WHAT WE ALSO SAW WERE A LOT OF SEQUEL LAWSUIT AGAINST WORK- AND THAT REALLY HURT I MEAN IT REALLY DROVE DOWN AND- DISCOURAGE BILLS IN COMING IN THEIR BUILDING- CAN SOMEONE COMING ON THE NEED FOR SEEK REFORM IS PART OF THE SOLUTION TO INCREASE HEALTH AND SUPPLY LOWER THE COST OF HOUSING PRODUCTION. SOMEBODY ANYBODY BE WILLING TO STEP IN- SEQUEL IS- IT'LL ORIGINALLY WELL INTENTIONED LAW THAT WAS HAS REASONS TO YOU EXIST TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND BLEEDING. WE SPEND A TON OF MONEY ON A SEQUIN HOUSES AND YARDS WHEN WE DO PROJECTS THEY HAVE TO BE VERY TIGHT BUT NOT TO GET PASSED THE SCRUTINY THE REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS. BUT ANYONE CAN FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST SUPER APPROVAL ANYONE FOR ANY REASON WHATSOEVER AND. MOST OF THOSE LAWSUITS ARE FILED BY. IT WAS JUST A QUESTION PARTY'S WITH QUESTIONS MOTIVES THEY'RE NOT REALLY TYPICALLY FROM NEIGHBORS WHO ARE OPPOSED TO PROJECT THEIR FILE BY PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE. OTHER MOTIVES FRANKLY AND SO. BASICALLY THESE LAWSUITS YOU GET WORKED OUT AND SETTLED. IT COSTS MONEY TO DO THAT IN THE LOW EIGHTIES THE AVAILABILITY OF THE DELAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THAT SUPPLY THE MARKET SO WHEN YOU RESTRICT SUPPLY IN ANY FASHION YOU'RE GOING TO REDUCE THE BELL BUILDING HOUSES AN INCREASE THE PRICE BECAUSE THERE'S DEMAND AND YOU CAN'T MEET THE DEMAND WITHOUT SUPPLY. SO THERE'S A LOT OF NEED FOR SIMPLE REFORM I THINK YOU'RE ALL AWARE OF THOSE ISSUES. SOONER OR LATER WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. YES IT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SEVERAL BILLS PENDING A LEGISLATURE EXPANSE THE QUOTE. AND WE'VE HAD BILLS WERE FOLKS SOONER SEQUEL THAT DIDN'T LIVE IN THE CITY. OF THE RICH THE AFFECTED RESIDENTS I MEAN SOMEONE THAT CAME FROM HOUSE OF THE CITY IN THE SUIT. AND THAT'S THE STARTING SO SEQUELS AND POURED TOOL BUT. IT HAS BEEN RIPE FOR ABUSE THANK YOU. I HAVE A UP QUESTION I THINK YOU ANSWERED IT ASSEMBLY. COOPER BUT IN FACT IS THAT THE CASE WHICH I BELIEVE IS THAT ANYBODY CAN FILE- LAWSUIT UNDER SYKORA. THAT LIVES IN ANY PART OF THE STATE IN IT THEY DON'T HAVE TO LIVE IN THAT JURISDICTION IS THAT TRUE. ANYBODY. I'M NOT A SUPER TURNING BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS TRUE IN FACT AND THEY CAN BE FUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE STATE. RIGHT SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE NOT WHAT THE QUESTION BUT JUST A FEW COMMENTS- MMHM PLEASE INDULGE ME BUT YOU KNOW WE TRAVELED UP AND DOWN THE STATE DURING THE RECESS AS HOUSING- PARTIES OR INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS TO THIS HOUSING CRISIS WE GOT A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION- BUT AS THINGS AND WE ARE DOING THAT BUT NONE OF IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THIS HOUSING CRISIS IF WE CONTINUE NOT ONLY WITH SEEK WERE- LAWSUITS BUT CANCELS LOCAL COUNCILS AND JURISDICTIONS THAT KEEPS SAYING NO. AND WHAT WE DO AT THE STATE AND END UP IN MAN'S ESSENCE BECOMES A BANDAID TO TRYING TO FIX WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION AND MANY MANYTIMES AND I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU LIVE I REPRESENT NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. WE WILL HEAR- DON'T MANDATE DON'T TELL US WHAT TO DO. STAY IN YOUR LANE THINGS LIKE THIS BUT THEN THE RESPONSE BACK IS IF WE HAVE COUNCILS THAT GO THROUGH THE PROCESS THE PROJECT COMES TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION. GOES THROUGH THOSE PROCESSES APPROVED GET STATE COUNCIL. AND THEN THAT COUNCIL BECAUSE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOW UP SAYING NO WE DON'T WANT THIS IN OUR BACKYARD NIMBYS THEY TABLE IT PUSH IT BACK SEND IT BACK TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WE ARE BASICALLY PUTTING OFF AND ELAINE AND WHAT WE ARE IN FACT DOING. IS PUSHING A PROJECTS SOMETIMES TWO YEARS BACK. AND THIS IS IN FACT ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEMS WE HAVE SO WE CAN SAY WELL IT'S SB NINE THAT'S TOO MUCH FOR THIS BUT WE ARE NOT SAYING YES. WE'RE NOT SAYING YES TO HOUSING AND THEN THE WHOLE OTHER IN PART IN THIS BECAUSE I TOOK AROUND OKAY A AND SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD THIS IS MY- PHONE GOING TO GO OUT IT. I TOOK A WALK AROUND THE CAPITAL THIS MORNING I COUNTED. ABOUT FIFTEEN TENS IT WAS SEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING. PEOPLE ARE GETTING UP STARTING THEIR DAY AND WHAT DO PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY GET UP IN THE MORNING WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU DO. SORRY GUYS WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM. AND IF WE HAVE PEOPLE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIVING ON THE STREETS WITH NO PUBLIC BATHROOMS. WHERE ARE THEY GOING. SO THAT'S THE SANITATION ISSUE BUT THE POINT IS IT'S GOOD WE DON'T HAVE HOUSING AND WE'RE NOT SAYING YES. AND THE STATE US HERE IN THIS ROOM GET A LOT OF FLAK FOR SAYING WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD. BUT THE TRUTH IS OUR JOB IS REALLY TO STAY IN OUR LANE BUT IF LOCALS ARE GOING TO DO THEIR JOB. WE HAVE TO STEP IN I'M SORRY. WE HAVE TO SAY YES TO HOUSING AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO LIVE IN HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE. SO ALL WE CAN DO IS LISTEN TAKE THE ADVICE HERE TRY TO PUT FORWARD BILLS BUT I ASK OUR COLLEAGUES AND THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE LISTENING DO NO HARM. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA SHARE YOUR COMMENTS. I'D HAVE TO SAY I AGREE YES TO HOUSING. MISTER SERRA. OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA WE GOT INTO THAT DISCUSSION WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL- LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE NO PROBLEMS HAVE APPROVING HOUSING WHAT THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH. IS WHEN THEY ARE HANDED A BAG OF REGULATIONS THAT CAN TAKE UP TO TEN YEARS FOR STUDIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE TO GET THROUGH A PROCESS. AND THEY HAVE LIMITED STAFF TO BE ABLE TO DO IT- THAT STUFF COMES FROM US-AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THEY SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT. ENOUGH MANDATES ALREADY. BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT. WHEN YOU DO A STUDY THAT TAKES THREE YEARS. AND THEN THE OTHER STUDIES WITH THAT YOU DID EARLIER ON BECOME OBSOLETE. ALL THOSE CITIES ARE DOING IS TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE REGULATIONS AND BEING ABLE TO GET A PROJECT THROUGH WITHOUT IT BEING CHALLENGED BY SEQUEL AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE BIG HOLD UP IS. OF A LOT OF CITIES OUR MASTER PLAN CITIES THEY WENT THROUGH A PROCESS BECAUSE AS WE ARE TALKING BUT WE HAVE GROWTH RINGS AND EACH EACH RAIN LEARNED FROM THE LAST RAIN WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T AND HOW YOU LAY OUT A CITY. AND THOSE THOSE APPROVALS GO THROUGH EIGHT CD YOU CAN'T GET AN APPROVAL FOR YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT IF YOU DON'T HAVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS IN IT. BUT YOU CAN'T CITIES DON'T BUILD HOMES. BUILDERS BUILD HOMES. AND THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BUILD IS IF THEY HOUSING. IS IF THEY'RE OUT DO YOU GUYS WANT ME TO STOP. OKAY BUT IT DID LOOK LIKE WE DID. SO IT'S THERE'S A COMBINATION OF PROBLEMS HERE BUT THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO KEEP UNDER CONSIDERATION. IS AS WE GO OUT AND ALLOW HOUSING INTO THOSE GROWTH RANGE WHICH WE NEED TO DESPERATELY. WE ALSO HAVE TO HAVE A BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT THAT ENCOURAGES JOBS IN THOSE AREAS. BECAUSE OTHERWISE ALL THOSE PEOPLE CAN BE DRIVING. ALL THOSE PEOPLE HAVE 61% OF THE AREA PEOPLE IN MY REGION. COMMUTE TWO HOURS TO GO GET A JOB ATTEMPT TO WORK. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WE KEEP WORKING AGAINST OURSELVES BECAUSE WE LIMIT LIMIT ARE JOB CREATION. WE HAVE MORE ENVIRONMENT WITH VAMP BAYERN MENTAL RESTRICTIONS AND THERE WE WANT MORE HOUSING WHICH WE NEED DESPERATELY. AND YET WE PILE A BUNCH OF RESTRICTIONS ON THAT VERY HOUSING FOR THE CITY'S TO BE THE REFEREE AND THEN WE BLAME THE CITIES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE DOING. THEY'RE TRYING THEY REALLY ARE AND IF YOU WANT TO COME DOWN TO MY REGIONAL GIVE YOU A GOOD TOUR THE CITY IS GOING TO BUILD HOUSING BUT THEY DO HAVE AN APPROVAL AND THEY HAVE THREE VOTES OUT OF FIVE TO SAY YES AND MANY OF THEM DON'T TAKE THAT AND WE HAVE THAT CAN WIN THE WORLD DOING A REMODELING WE HAVE A CHOICE. CHECK FOR TWENTY YEARS WE'RE ALSO IN A REMOTE WORKING ENVIRONMENT WHERE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE CAN WORK FROM HOME SO WE GOT TO HAVE IT AS WELL. I DON'T FEEL SORRY FOR LOW COLLECTORS WHO WON'T DO THEIR JOBS SORRY CAN WE JUST- BRING IT BACK HERE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE- COMMITTEE OR THE THAT THE- FOLKS WERE TESTIFYING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER KALRA. BUT I YOU KNOW I. THINK THAT I JUST. R. S. TO CHIME IN AND SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM. ORANGE COUNTY I SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL OF A MAJOR CITY FOR EIGHT YEARS WHEN WE WERE THE ONLY ONES BUILDING ALL THE TOWNS AROUND US AND NOTHING TO DO WITH REGULATION OR ANYTHING THE REALITY IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANNA BUILD. I WAS ON A ON A BAG ON HOUSING ALL THE SMALL TOWNS GET OUT SO THEY DIDN'T CARE. BECAUSE THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY- THE JOBS ARE BEING CREATED APPLE HEADQUARTERS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT- AND INDUSTRIAL OFFICE COMPLEXES BUILT IN THE LAST. TWO DECADES. AND THAT SAME CITY BLOCK ANY OFFICER HOUSING UNTIL SB THIRTY FIVE WAS PASSED AND WE FINALLY HAD A CHANCE. TO BUILD HOUSES HOUSING DOWN THE STREET WITH APPLE HEADQUARTERS SO- THERE THERE'S- MATH. THAT GETS REPEATED THAT THE STATE IS. YOUR MEDDLING AT A LOCAL LEVEL THE REALITIES OF THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'VE ABDICATED THE RESPONSIBILITY. STATES FAR TOO MANY OF THE SMALL TOWNS. AND SMALL CITIES DO NOT WANT TO BUILD. AND I'VE SEEN IT YOUR WITH SILICON VALLEY IS THE ECONOMIC ENGINE OF NOT JUST THE STATE BUT THE COUNTRY. SO JOBS ARE THERE GREAT JOBS ARE THERE PEOPLE HAVE MONEY. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH HOMES PEOPLE TO BUY. THAT IS BECAUSE THE SMALL SMALLER TOWNS IN JURISDICTIONS THINK IT'S JUST THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF SAN FRANCISCO THOUSAND OPEN TO BUILD AND NOBODY ELSE'S. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY EVERYONE HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. AND WE MADE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF FACILITATING- THE HIGHER DENSITY FACILITATING TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT. THEY STILL DON'T WANT ANY BETTER THAN THE DAY- THEY DON'T WANT TO BE TOLD WHAT TO DO BUT THEY'RE NOT TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF DEALING WITH THESE WE ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHAT. I'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST. NO FOURTEEN PLAY YEARS OF BEING ALLOWED OFFICIALS LOOK ABOUT. IT GETS WORSE AND WORSE WELL THESE BIG CITIES. THEIR BEST TO DO WITH THE HOMELESSNESS IS. NUMBER RAPPER WE- SUPPORT OF AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TRY TO DO ALL THAT. AT THE SAME TIME WHILE. BEING SUED BY NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS WHEN YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO BUILD NEAR THE BORDER- IT WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS ANYONE HOUSING. CLOSE TO THEM LET ALONE IN THEIR OWN JURISDICTION. THAT'S WHAT I'VE WITNESSED DAY IN DAY OUT FOR WELL OVER A DECADE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY. WE HAVE THESE DEBATES ON ON WHAT. IF ANYTHING FACT SACRAMENTO SHOULD DO. TO PUSH THE ISSUE. IN SAN JOSE THANK YOU MR CALLER. MISTER COOPER BUT LOOKING FOR MEDIUM SIZE CITY IT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T STATE GOVERNMENT YES SOME CITIES. SHOULD RESPONSIBILITIES BUT AS REASON FOLKS MOVING OUT OF THE BAY AREA MOVING SEGMENT DRIVING PRICES UP. YOUR PRICES ARE EXORBITANT THERE FOR WHATEVER REASON APPLE OR FLICKR COMING IN. PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO LIVE THERE IS STILL COME DOWN AT THE FORCIBLE. BOTH MY KIDS HAVE HOUSES THEY MOVED HOME FOR TWO YEARS AFTER COLLEGE TO SAVE MONEY TO BUY HEALTHCARE DOLLARS BUT HOUSE IN APRIL OF LAST YEAR. AND PAY FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OVER. ASKING PRICE TO GET A HOUSE. WE WILL BUILD CALIFORNIA NOT BIZ THE HOUSE. DEVELOPERS DIFFICULT WHEN LAWS ARE. THE MAN TO THE- I'VE BEEN FIFTEEN A LOCAL. AND IT THAT'S CRAZY. CALIFORNIA'S LAW EXPENSIVE. YOU AT ALL. THE HIGHEST PRICES GAS. FOOD PRICES IN JUST IMPACTS THE COMPOUNDS IT MORE TIME AND TIME AGAIN WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING WE CAN'T BUILD OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOUR BILL TO HEAR HALF MOON DOOR TO DOOR. OPERATION HOKEY RUKI HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN SACRAMENTO TO REHAB HOTEL IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO WHAT CAN YOU BILL FOR THAT. SO I MEAN IT IS A PROBLEM I DON'T SEE IS GETTING OUT OF IT ANYTIME SOON IT'S BEEN EXACERBATED IT WAS IT. TOOK IT WAS CURRENT LONG BEFORE WE CAME HERE. AND BEFORE WE LEAVE IS NOT ON THE SALT SO IT IS VERY FRUSTRATING I KNOW WE ALL HAVE GREAT WE'RE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT IT. AND WE HAVE GOOD INTENTIONS BUT- THIS LIKE I SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO OUR WAY OUT OF THIS IT IS IT IS INSANE WHAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND FOR SOME FOLKS IF THE SEPARABLE. FOR FOLKS TO BE HOMELESS NOT ANYBODY HERE BUT FROM OTHER FOLKS SO I HEAR MY COLLEAGUES ARE YOUR THING AND I AGREE WITH YOU A LOT OF ASPECTS OF IT BUT- THERE ARE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS TO THIS. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS- MR CALLER JUST AS ONE QUICK YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS ALL SAME BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS. THAT FOCUSING HAVING TROUBLE BUILDING. CITY COUNCILS ASKING IF THEY CAN GET PERMITTED TO BUILD ARE BEING DENIED LEFT AND RIGHT. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M REFERRING THOSE SMALL AT THOSE SMALLER TOWNS OF SILICON VALLEY BUT ACTUALLY ALLOWED BUILDING TO BE LESS A MOTIVATION FOR FOLKS TO COME INTO THE SACRAMENTO AREA INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY BECAUSE OUR BE MORE HOUSING STOCK AVAILABLE TO THEM. IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD YEP. JERRY HAVE LAWS THAT ARE SPECIFIC THAT SILICON VALLEY AND NOT AS NECESSARY I. DON'T WANT. NOTE ON THAT. LITTLE BIT- TO CALL- AS WE DO OUR- PLACE. DID YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT TO OPEN A AND BE RECOGNIZED. SURE THANK YOU. SO WHY OF THE ISSUE IS YOU THE LIVE TO IT SAN INSULA VALLEY IS NOT WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN AND SO AND SOUTHWEST RIVERSIDE COUNTY. AND SO YOU CAN'T APPLY SOLUTIONS FOR SILICON VALLEY THAT WORK DOWN THERE BECAUSE YOU'LL YOU WHAT YOU'LL DO IS YOU'LL SET UP A WHOLE DIFFERENT- IT SHOULD HAVE A WHOLE ARRAY OF DIFFERENT PROBLEMS. INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION ISSUES WE DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING THAT THEY HAVE UP HERE FOR ROADSAND BRIDGES AND IF THEY DON'T WANT TO BUILD MORE ROADS BUT WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE ROADS IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE HOUSING. AND WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE JOBS AND WE'RE WE'RE DISCOURAGING ALL OF IT. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THE CROSS THIS ARGUMENT IS THERE'S DIFFERENT PLACES HAVE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND WE NEED TO TREAT THEM DIFFERENTLY WE CAN'T JUST LAY A BLANKET OVER THE WHOLE THING. THANK YOU THANK YOU RESIDE OUT AT CHAIR CREO. THANK YOU I LOVE THE ROBUST DIALOGUE AND CONVERSATION I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL AND PART OF A LARGER COMPLICATED ISSUE RELATED TO EVERYTHING HOUSING HOMELESSNESS TRANSPORTATION GOOD JOBS. EQUITABLE RESOURCES IT'S ALL RELATED. AND THE TOPIC OF OUR CONVERSATION TODAY IT'S ULTIMATELY HOMEOWNERSHIP WHICH HAS BECOME LESS AND LESS ATTAINABLE ALL OF US I CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A HOME IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT. A TWO BEDROOM SMALL CALIFORNIA BUNGALOW IN THE COMMUNITY OF EL SERENO WHICH A FEW YEARS AGO YOU COULD GET FOR UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST SOLD LAST MONTH FOR ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT IS ABLE TO AFFORD THAT HOME AT THE CRUX OF ALL THIS AND AS WE HAVE PANELIST. HERE IT IT REALLY IS ABOUT HOW WE ARE MAKING. HOME OWNERSHIP MORE ATTAINABLE TO EVERYDAY PEOPLE ACROSS OUR STATE AND- ARE WE CREATING THE SOLUTIONS FOR IT SO AS WE EVALUATE THESE BARRIERS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND LOOK. TOWARDS MAKING FUNDING DECISIONS FOR THE FUTURE. SHOULD STATE FUNDING FOCUS ON CREATING MORE SUPPLY OF OWNERSHIP AND IF SO AT WHAT LEVELS. AND HOW FAST DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD. IF ANYONE IN THE PANEL CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS WE'D BE MOST APPRECIATIVE. THANK YOU I'LL JUMP IN QUICKLY ON THE FIRST- SHOULD CALIFORNIA INVEST IN THE ANSWER IS YES- AS I WAS TRYING MY BEST TO ILLUSTRATE THE INVESTMENT IN HOMEOWNERSHIP IS. TINY TO NONEXISTENT SO WE NEED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY AND THAT WILL MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE IN BALANCING. THE UNAFFORDABILITY. I THINK I'VE I WOULD SECOND THAT AND- ALSO SAY THAT. IF THE STATE COULD ACCELERATE ITS- FUNDING AWARD PROCESS AND CON CAN. EXTRACTION OIL- OUT ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE WITH AWARD EASE IT WOULD BE QUITE HELPFUL BECAUSE TYPICALLY WHEN WE APPLY WE ARE READY TO BUILD AND- SO WE CAN WE CAN START. YOU KNOW WITHIN A MONTH OF WHEN WE APPLY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL BEFORE MOVE TO CUT PUBLIC COMMENT. THIS IS- YOU'RE GONNA ADD ON YEAH THAT SAME ITEM OF CLEARLY THERE ARE FINANCING PROGRAMS HERE THAT ARE VERY BENEFICIAL AND WELL DESIGNED IT NEEDS SUPPORT. IF YOU DON'T INCREASE SUPPLY. JUST POURING MORE MONEY INTO THE SAME SIZE BAG SO NO MATTER WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM IF YOU'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE MARKET WITHOUT INCREASING SUPPLY. INCREASING PRICE YOU'RE PUTTING MORE BUYERS INTO THE POOL OF THE SAME HOUSES SO SUPPLY IS KEY IT'S BASIC ECONOMICS WE DON'T HAVE MORE SUPPLY WILL NOT RESOLVE THE PROBLEM. THEY YOU VERY MUCH IS A PRE THE- CONVERSATION HERE ON THE DICE AND WITH THE PANELISTS TODAY- YOU KNOW I WANT TO AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED I THINK ALL OF US AGREE WE NEED TO BUILD MORE HOMES. FOR THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES SCHEIBER WE NEED TO BE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL HOMES AT ALL INCOME LEVELS VERY LOW INCOME- A YOU KNOW MIDDLE INCOME MARKET RATE AND ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY I THINK IS CRITICAL THAT'S WHY THINGS LIKE SB THIRTY FIVE SB FIFTY S. B. NINE. AND SOME OF THE STREAMLINING BILLS ARE SO CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT AND THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO DO- I GET APPRECIATE. THE CONVERSATION WE WILL NOW I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO MY CO CHAIR AND CHAIR CARILLO FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION TODAY.

SEVERAL DIFFERENT ISSUES HAVE COME TO THE LIGHT TRANSPORTATION HOUSING HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS A WHOLE OTHER SUB COMMITTEE AS WELL AND RESOURCES TO. ON WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHICH ARE COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO MENTIONED AND SO. I THINK WE ARE FEELING THE FRUSTRATION FELT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT WE'RE SEEN AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING SO.
