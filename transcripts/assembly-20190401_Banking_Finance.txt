AND NOW I'M I'M GOING TO PASS IT OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR -- SINCE I WILL BE PRESENTING THE NEXT TO BILLS WILL START WITH -- FIVE THIRTY NINE AND THEN SIX FORTY TWO AB FIVE THREE NINE AUTHORED BY TOURNAMENT Là MON -- AS A REMINDER WE'RE LIMITING TESTAMENT EIGHT MINUTES -- MADAM CHAIR AT YOUR PLEASURE. AND JUST TO CLARIFY IT SETS MONEY AFTER THE AUTHOR'S COMING. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER. GRAYSON AS THE JOINT AUTHORS WILL ALSO BE AS WORKING WITH ME ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. THANK YOU VICE TREND MEMBERS AB FIVE THIRTY NINE IS AN IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL THAT IS YEARS OVERDUE. THE UNDER UNREGULATED INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS LED TO AN EXPLOSION OF HIGH COST LOANS OVER THE PAST DECADE THESE LOANS START AT TWO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND HAVE INTEREST RATES FROM A HUNDRED TO MORE THAN 2100%. FAR TOO OFTEN CONSUMERS ARE UNABLE TO REPLACE THESE EXPENSIVE LOANS DATA PROVIDED BY HAAS HI COST LENDERS TO OUR STATE REGULATORS SHOW THAT APPROXIMATELY ONE OUT OF THREE LOANS ARE WRITTEN OFF BY LENDERS. BUT A WRITTEN OFF ALONE IS NOT THE END OF THE STORY LENDERS SELL THESE WRITTEN OFF LOANS TO DEBT COLLECTORS WHO REMITTANCE RELENTLESSLY PURSUE CONSUMERS FOR THE AMOUNT OWED. THIS PROCESS RESULTS IN DAMAGE CREDIT FOR CONSUMERS AND CAN LEAD TO THEIR PAYCHECKS BEING GARNISH THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS CLOSED OR THEIR CAR BEING REPOSSESSED. ONE OUT OF THREE TIMES. AND I CANNOT THINK OF ANY OTHER PRODUCT THAT FEELS SO OFTEN WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STEPPING IN TO INTERVENE. HI COST LENDERS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL SAY THAT THEY NEED TO CHARGE SUCH HIGH RATES TO MAKE UP FOR CONSUMERS WHO DEFAULT. BUT THESE RATES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING THESE LOANS AND AFFORDABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE LET'S WALK THROUGH A COMPARISON. TAKE IN TAKE FOR EXAMPLE A TWO YEAR TWENTY SIX HUNDRED LOAN WHICH IS A FAIRLY COMMON PRODUCT IN THE MARKET. IF THE CONSUMER GET THIS LOAN FROM A RESPONSIBLE THE LENDER CHARGING 36% THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENT WOULD BE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEY WOULD PAY BACK A TOTAL OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN. ON THE OTHER HAND IF A CONSUMER GETS A LOAN FROM A HIGH COST PROVIDER WITH THEIR MONTHLY PAY THEIR WITH THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENTS WOULD JUMP TO FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN AND THEY WOULD PAY BACK A TOTAL OF A NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT SAME TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR. LOAN. ARE WE REALLY WILLING TO BELIEVE THAT DEFAULTING ON SUCH A LOAN IS DUE TO THE RISKY NESS OF THE CONSUMER AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE SKY HIGH INTEREST RATE CHARGED BY THE LENDER. THE OUTCOMES OF THIS UNREGULATED SPACE ARE CLEAR. THESE HIGH INTEREST RATES ALLOW LENDERS TO REMAIN SUSTAINABLY PROFITABLE. EVEN WHEN ONE THIRD OR MORE OF THEIR BARRELS ULTIMATELY DEFAULT ON THE LOAN. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL PUT A STOP TO THIS RIGHETTI. AT RINGGIT RIGID INCENTIVE STRUCTURE THE IDEA THAT CONSUMERS WILL NOT HAVE CREDIT OPTIONS IF THIS BILL PASSES IS NOT REALISTIC THE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS TO SUPPORT THIS BILL HAVE FOUND WAYS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE CREDIT OPTIONS TO BARS WITH DAMAGE CREDIT FOR EVEN NO CREDIT SCORE AT ALL. AND LET'S BE CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS AN OUTLIER WE ARE AMONG A SMALL MINORITY OF STATES THAT DO NOT CAP INTEREST RATES ON THESE LOANS BOTH RED AND BLUE STATES CAP THE INTEREST RATES. 80% OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE UNITED STATES LIVE IN A STATE WHERE THE RATE IS CAPPED ON THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT. I HAVE WORK TO FIND A COMPROMISE THAT COULD EARN THE SUPPORT FROM BOTH CONSUMER GROUPS AND LENDERS ALIKE AND AB FIVE THREE NINE IS THE RESULT OF THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WE HAVE A STRONG AND GROWING COALITION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LABOR ORGANIZATIONS RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND VETERANS GROUPS TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. I WILL NOW TURN MY TIME OVER TO JOINT AUTHORED A SOME MEMBER TIM GRAYSON WHO HAS BEEN A VALUABLE PARTNER TO MEET WITH THESE EFFORTS. THANK YOU TO MY JOINT AUTHORED MADAM CHAIR AS WELL AS VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENTS SOME OF THE MORE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND THE GREATER BAY AREA. SINCE MY TIME ON THE CONCORD CITY COUNCIL I HAVE STRUGGLED WITH THIS VERY QUESTION OF ACCESS OR THE QUESTION OF INTEREST RATES AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. WITH THAT IN MIND I BELIEVE THAT AB FIVE THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS THE BEST PUBLIC POLICY BALANCE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS CONSIDER ON THIS ISSUE IN RECENT MEMORY. WE KNOW THAT SINCE THE START OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SEEN AN EXPLOSION AND HIGH COST PREDATORY LENDING INTO THE SUBPRIME MARKET. FROM 200-082-2000 SEVENTEEN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE DATA FOR TRIPLE DIGIT LOAN VOLUMES HAVE INCREASED OVER 17000%. ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF ALL HIGH COST LOANS ENDED DEFAULT. AND FOR THOSE LOAN SECURED BY A CAR TITLE THE NEGATIVE OUTCOME IS EVEN GREATER BECAUSE REPOSSESSION CAN DEPRIVE A BORROWER OF THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL TO THEIR WORK. MEMBERS I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER THIS QUESTION. IS THERE ANY PRODUCT THAT IS LEGAL TO SELL IN CALIFORNIA THAT FAILS MORE THAN ONE THIRD OF THE TIME. I CERTAINLY CANNOT THINK OF ONE SO WHY DO WE ALLOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OUR CONSTITUENTS FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS TO CONTINUE TO FACE FINANCIAL RUIN THROUGH TRIPLE DIGIT LENDING. AB FIVE THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO REIN IN PREDATORY LENDING HERE IN THIS STATE. YOU WILL HEAR FROM A BROAD COALITION OF CONSUMER GROUPS LENDERS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS ALL IN SUPPORT OF FIVE THIRTY NINE THEY RIGHTFULLY RECOGNIZE THAT FOR THAT. FOR TOO LONG THESE EXORBITANTLY PRICED BLOWN PRODUCTS ARE NOT ACTUALLY HOPING CONSUMERS AND THAT ACCESS TO CAPITAL CAN NO LONGER BE AN EFFECTIVE ARGUMENT TO MAINTAINING THE PREDATORY STATUS QUO. I BELIEVE THAT TODAY THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF ALL STAKEHOLDERS BUT ESPECIALLY DARK CHAIR MS Là MOAN AND HER STAFF WE HAVE FOUND A BALANCE THAT WILL ENSURE A ROBUST MARKETPLACE FOR SMALL DOLLAR LENDING. WHILE WEEDING OUT THE MOST EGREGIOUS PRODUCTS SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF AB FIVE THIRTY NINE I HAVE SPENT TIME AROUND MY DISTRICT TALKING TO CONSTITUENTS ABOUT SMALL DOLLAR INTEREST RATES. WITHOUT FAIL THEY ARE SHOCKED THAT WE HAVE ALLOWED THE CURRENT MARKET PLACE TO IT TO PERSIST. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN BRINGING ECONOMIC FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE BACK TO THIS MARKETPLACE BY SUPPORTING AB FIVE THIRTY NINE AND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TAX MONEY FOR OTHER WHEN THIS IS A IN SUPPORT PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS FATE CALMLY WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF TODAY I'M HERE TO ANSWER A QUESTION I'VE BEEN GETTING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WHICH IS WHY IT'S LA COUNTY SPONSORING. AB. FIVE THIRTY NINE NOT MANY ARE AWARE OF OUR BOARD'S COMMITMENT TO CURBING THE EFFECTS OF THESE HIGH COST LOANS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. AFTER RESEARCH BY THE GPO FOUND THAT OVER 60% OF HIGH COST LOAN STORE FRIENDS ARE CONCENTRATED IN AREAS WITH FAMILY POVERTY RATES WELL ABOVE THE STATE AVERAGE. OUR BOARD REALIZE THAT IT NEEDED TO ACT TO PROTECT VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM THE HARMFUL COST OF THESE LOANS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN OUR COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AND BUSINESS AFFAIRS WITH DIRECTED TO FORM A WORKING GROUP THAT WOULD STUDY OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THESE LOANS HAVE ON COUNTY COMMUNITIES. AND TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE MARKETINGCAMPAIGN THAT WOULD FOCUS ON EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TO THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO THESE LENDERS. WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL EDUCATION CONSUMERS AND TO INFORM PEOPLE ABOUT COUNTY SERVICES AND BENEFITS. WHILE DETERMINING WHAT WE CAN DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO HIGH COST LOANS. THAT ARE TRAPPING OR COMMUNITIES AND A NEVER ENDING CYCLE OF DEBT. A GREAT AMOUNT OF WORK IS BEING DONE BY THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OUR COUNTY STAFF. AS WELL AS COMMUNITY CUT COMMUNITY PARTNERS BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. I RECOGNIZE THAT NO MATTER THEM OUT OF EDUCATION PARTNERSHIPS AND ZONING ORDINANCES CHANGE NEEDS TO OCCUR AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND STOPPING THE PREDATION ON THOSE WERE SIMPLY TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF POOR OPTIONS. THE BOARD THANKS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN FOR HER COMMITMENT TO THIS NECESSARY REFORM THAT WILL ALLOW LA COUNTY AND OTHERS TO FURTHER HELP OUR COMMUNITIES BUILD AND MAINTAIN FINANCIAL HEALTH. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CHRISTINE ABBAS HAMILTON I'M HERE REPRESENTING YOU D. W. APPS ME -- WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND AYE HSS. PROVIDERS IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES PROVIDERS AND OF COURTING TO THE DATA THE AVERAGE INCOME OF BORROWERS OF THESE PAYDAY LOANS ANOTHER SHORT TERM HIGH INTEREST LOANS A HAVE ANNUAL INCOMES BETWEEN. TEN THOUSAND AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND THAT SQUARELY DESCRIBES OUR MEMBERSHIP OUR FOLKS EARNED FOR THE MOST PART MINIMUM WAGE. THEY CARE FOR LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY ARE FAMILY MEMBERS. AND SO THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS VERY LOW IN OUR MEMBERS ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT UNFORTUNATELY ARE MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY. THE HIGH INTEREST RATES THAT THESE LOANS -- ARE AFFORDING THEM BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE HERE SAID THESE ARE PEOPLE IN DESPERATE SITUATIONS WHO DON'T HAVE A LOT OF GOOD CHOICES IN TERMS OF ACCESSING MONEY AS SOON AS THEY NEED IT. WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE THINK -- THE CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR FOR INTRODUCING IT BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY STRONG PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE. FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE -- OUR ORGANIZATION WE ADVOCATE FOR POLICIES THAT HELP OUR MEMBERS IN GENERAL ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO PAYCHECK ISSUES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORTED THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY NAME IS MABEL LEASE BROWN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RIGHTS ADVOCATES WERE BASED IN OAKLAND WE PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS. PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I WANTED TO SHARE A COUPLE OF CLIENTS STORIES WE PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICES WE DO POLICY WORK. ON WITH PARTNERS AROUND THE TABLE AROUND THE ROOM -- BUT I THINK PUTTING SOME CLIENTS STORIES OUT THERE HELPS TO REALLY ILLUSTRATE WITH PEOPLE THING GOING THROUGH SO -- ONE OF THE ONE OF THE COMMON THEMES THAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING LET MORE MONEY THAN WHAT THEY ASKED FOR WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY NEEDED IN ORDER TO GO AHEAD AND PUT THEM IN THE TERRITORY OF THE EXEMPTION TO CURRENT EXEMPTION TO THE INTEREST RATE CAPS -- SO IN ONE CASE WE ARE SERVED A THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD WOMAN SEPARATED FROM HER SPOUSE MONTHLY INCOME OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS A MONTH TO SUPPORT HER AND HER TWO CHILDREN -- SHE GOT A LOAN FROM LOAN MARTIN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLINE THEN QUICKLY FELL BEHIND THE LETTER BORROW FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS SHE HAD ASKED FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SUPPORT HER MEDIA IT NEEDS. BY THE TIME SHE CAME TO MY OFFICE SHE HAD ALREADY PAID THEM TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON HER FOUR THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN AND STILL OWE THEM ANOTHER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE. I AM REPAYMENT PERIOD WAS SO LENGTHY HER MONTHLY PAYMENTS FOR FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO DOLLARS EVERY MONTH. AW AND AT SOME POINT SHE ENDED UP FLIPPING OUT LOAN AGAIN WITH LOW MARK BECAUSE SHE JUST COULDN'T KEEP UP WITH THAT AND YET WAS TRYING TO STAY CURRENT. SO THE DEVASTATION THE PEOPLE IT'S NOT JUST IN THE MOMENT IT'S NOT JUST THE EMOTIONAL THE SHAME AND THE STRESS OF TRYING TO KEEP UP IT IS ALSO SEVEN YEARS OF DAMAGE TO YOUR CREDIT REPORT. IN WHAT IS AN INEVITABLE -- BAD ENDING TO THESE KINDS OF ONES WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY ABLE TO GET OUT OF THESE LOANS WITHOUT -- SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. HER INTEREST RATE ON THIS LOAN WITH A HUNDRED AND SEVEN POINT ANOTHER STORE I WANT TO SHARE. SEVEN YEAR OLD RENTER RESEARCH WHO WAS WIDOWED WAS LIVING ON FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH IN SOCIAL SECURITY AND PENSION. OF FUNDS SHE GOT A LOAN FROM CASH CALL SHE'D BEEN PAYING ON INTO -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AT AND FOR WELL OVER A ALREADY PAID OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A FORTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN BY THE TIME SHE GOT TO MY OFFICE FOR HELP. OF WITH ANOTHER SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT SHE WAS DUE TO PAY ON THIS LOAN -- INTEREST RATE WAS A 117% THING IS THEY'RE JUST VERY FEW THERE'S NOT MUCH BUT THERE'S NOT A LOT WE CAN DO FOR PEOPLE AT THAT POINT BECAUSE THE LAW HAS NOT BEEN PROTECTIVE. AND WHEN PEOPLE HAVE STEPPED INTO THESE LOANS -- PEOPLE IMAGINE THAT WHEN A PRODUCT IS ALLOWED TO EXIST THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IS DAMAGING WHY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT ALLOW THESE THINGS TO GO ON IF IT WERE SO TERRIBLY TERRIBLY DAMAGING THERE'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF INNOCENCE -- THAT PEOPLE HAVE WHEN THEY STEP IN AND WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INTEREST RATE -- WHEN THE AMOUNT OF THE MOUNT THAT IS LINKED TO PEOPLE COMPARED TO THEIR INCOME? IT WAS CLEARLY LOAN THAT THEY WERE NEVER GOING TO BE ABLE TO REPAY SOUTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR SPONSORS WORK ON THIS AUTHORS WORK ON THIS -- ONE BILL CAN THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SCOTT GOVERNOR HERE BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THEIR OFF THE AUTHORS FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS EFFORT WE OPPOSED MR CALORIES BILL LAST YEAR. IT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED MY MEMBERS FROM LANDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL DOES NOT DO THAT -- MY MEMBERS INCLUDE -- CONSUMER FINANCE LENDERS BIG AND SMALL TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR SHOPS. THEY ISSUE LOANS THAT 36% OR BELOW THEIR CHARGE OFF RATES ARE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS -- AS TO THE FICUS SCORES BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED THAT WE LEARN TO PEOPLE WITH ONLY BETTER FICUS SCORES ARE MEMBERS OFTEN RIGHT PEOPLE WITH NO FICUS SCORES THIS IS A FUNCTION OF UNDERWRITING THIS IS WHAT WE DO INSPIRED CHARGE OFFS ARE SO LOW. LASTLY A BIG COMPONENT OF OUR BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE LOANS PEOPLE COME IN WITH THAT LOANS THE TERMS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SUGGESTED. AND WE TRY TO GET THEM OUT OF THOSE LOANS SO TO THE EXTENT THOSE PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR OUR LOANS THAT WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED IN THE FIRST PLACE. AFTER THE BUSINESS REASON FOR SUPPORTING THE SPELL. WE WANT CERTAINTY THE MARKET PLACE THERE WAS A CASH CALL DECISION BUT SIX EIGHT MONTHS AGO. THE DEEMED THEIR LOANS UNCONSCIONABLE THE COURT DID NOT DEFINE WHAT CONSTABLE WAS CREATE SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR US WE ALSO BELIEVE GIVEN THAT -- THE FACT THAT SO MANY OTHER STATES HAVE INTEREST RATE CAPS THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE. EFFORT UNDER WAY TO GO TO THE BALLOT WE WOULD HAVE LOST THAT FIGHT AND IT WOULD HAVE PRECLUDED US FROM BEING IN THE MARKET. BASED ON THE HISTORICAL MODELS IF YOU LOOK AT THE CAL REBEL FOR EXAMPLE. SO WE WANT STABILITY IN THE MARKET WE THINK THIS DOES THAT WE AGAIN -- APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE AUTHORS AND AN URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES -- IN SUPPORT NAMED AFFILIATION PLEASE. HI HI SABRINA HAM ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION IN CALIFORNIANS FOR ECONOMIC JUSTICE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU.

WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE THE WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION PLEASE. AND OF FROM REMINDER -- OUR TESTIMONIES EIGHT MINUTES MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL LET BUILT A REPRESENTING ACCESS FINANCIAL AND CHECK INTO CASH -- WE OWE OUR LENDERS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR BOTH THE CHAIR. ON THE MISTER GRAYSON -- AND THERE. A DESIRE TO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WHAT DID YOU WANT TO SAY THAT. WE REPRESENT THOSE LENDERS THAT HAVE 70% AND HIGHER INTEREST RATE LOANS I'M NOT -- I'M I'M NOT. APOLOGETIC ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT. I'VE READ LETTERS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT. AND JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOW CREDIT SCORE. DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE STUPID CUSTOMERS -- LOTS OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS THAT PUT HIM INTO THAT PREDICAMENT -- WE BELIEVE THAT IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF CONSUMER REFORMS. THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THOSE AREAS -- WE'VE BEEN CALLED PREDATORY LENDERS OVER NOT PREDATORY LENDERS WERE A REGULATED LENDER -- PREDATORY LENDER THIS. IS NOT PREDATORY JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT IT'S A HIGH INTEREST RATE. THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS INVOLVED WITH BEING PREDATORY LENDERS -- HOWEVER. THERE WOULD BE ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF ACCESS TO CREDIT. THAT WOULD BE ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL BY THE FACT SHEET THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE AUTHOR. THE QUESTION YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IS WORDED THESE PEOPLE GO. AND WE WOULD -- SAY THAT THEY WOULD GO TO THE UNREGULATED MARKET PLACE THAT COULD BE. A VARIETY OF AREAS COULD BE UNREGULATED INTERNET. COULD BE TRIBAL ENDING THEIR SOVEREIGN NATIONS ARM. AND AREN'T REGULATED IN THE SAME WAY THAT OURS ARE REGULATED. AND BEFORE YOU VOTE ON THIS BILL I JUST LIKE YOU DO AT LEAST THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT -- THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. OF THERE ARE STUDIES AND THERE'S INFORMATION. AND I LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY OF LAST WEEK BY -- FORMER CHAIR OF THE SEA OF P. B. -- CHAIRMAN CORDUROY. THIS AND SEEM TO SAY THAT THERE WAS NO IMPACT. ON REDUCING THE INTEREST RATES DOWN 236% THERE IS IN FACT AN IMPACT -- ORGAN OF FOR EXAMPLE HAD THE HIGHEST -- RATE OF INTERNET. OF FRAUD -- AFTER THEM PASSING A SUCH AN INTEREST RATE. AND THERE ARE OTHER STATES OF ALSO HAD -- FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THEIR <u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G -- THEIR CITIZENS OF&lt;/c&gt;</u> THESE ARE STUDIES DONE BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD STUDIES DONE DONE BY DARTMOUTH SO THESE ARE NOT JUST INDUSTRY STUDIES. ON AN ISLAND LIKE TO SAY IS THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL -- BUT THERE IS NO RESPONSE. TO WHAT HAPPENS INDIVIDUALS THAT -- WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET HER ALONE BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOWER CREDIT RISK. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU. THINK ABOUT I'M VICE CHAIRMAN CHEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ADDRESS YOU TODAY AN IMPORTANT TOPIC HI MELISSA SOBRE WITH CAROL FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE THIRTY SIX STORES HERE OPERATING A SPEEDY CASH WE OPERATE ONLINE. WE DO OFFER ALL THREE CONSUMER LOAN PRODUCTS PAYDAY LOANS AUTO TITLE LOANS AN UNSECURED INSTALLMENT LOANS. I WANT TO TAKE MY BRIEF TIME TODAY TO ADDRESS -- FOR ITEMS FROM THE FACT SHEET THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED BY THE AUTHOR. THE FIRST ONE I'M GOING TO ADDRESS IS THE THE QUOTE OF THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING AND I CAN'T. AGREE MORE WITH THAT QUOTE -- I'VE DISTRIBUTED THIS SHEET HERE THESE ARE THE CONSUMER LOAN PRODUCTS AVAILABLE TO NON PRIME CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN VOLUME FROM THE DB O. REPORTS. YOU'LL SEE ON THE LEFT SIDE TWO POINT NINE BILLION IN PAYDAY LOANS ON THE RIGHT SIDE TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LOANS. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT GAP IN THE MIDDLE WITH ABOUT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND R. SIT THREE SORRY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION LOANS BETWEEN -- ZERO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDER THE CFL KIND OF THAT GAP IN THE MIDDLE. SO THAT THAT LENDING IN THE MIDDLE REPRESENTS 6% OF THIS ENTIRE VOLUME. IN WHAT NON PRIME CONSUMERS REALLY NEED. IS ALONE IN THE MIDDLE BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TWO FIFTY FIVE AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IF YOU LOOK AT CLARITY'S NON PRIME ONE A ONE STUDY. THE AVERAGE UNSECURED INSTALLMENT LOAN ACROSS THE US IS FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND FORTY DOLLARS. IF YOU LOOK AT DATA FROM ONE OF OUR LARGEST LEGIONS THEM THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF CREDIT THAT CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA GOING ONLINE LOOKING FOR IS JUST OVER. NINE HUNDRED THESE NON PRIME CONSUMERS NEED SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE IN CALIFORNIA IS. UNUSUAL RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY THEIR CHOICES MOST OFTEN ARE TWO FIFTY FIVE OR OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SAID THE STATUS QUO IS NOT WORKING I AGREE WITH THAT. IN IN THIS MIDDLE -- TWO THIRDS OF THAT LENDING IS BEING DONE BY PILOT PROGRAM LANDERS I THINK PILOT PROGRAMS LOANS ARE TERRIFIC SOLUTION FOR A SMALL SUBSECTION OF NON PRIME CONSUMERS. IN AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF PILOT PROGRAM LOANS YOU KNOW THE DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT THEY JUST CAN'T SERVE KIND OF THE BROADER -- NON PRIME CONSUMER SEGMENT THERE. EVEN WITH A PILOT PROGRAM LENDERS WITH THE ABILITY TO GET UP 259% APR. THE SECOND THING ON THE FACT SHEET I WANT TO ADDRESS IS. THIS COMPROMISE REFLECTS THE HIGHER COSTS FOR LENDERS TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M LOST ON THAT -- ONE LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS 36% A PR THIS BILL IS 36% PLUS THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE WHICH IS ABOUT TWO TWO AND A HALF PERCENT SO THAT'S THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT. SO LEMME JUST STATE FOR THE RECORD WE CANNOT SERVE OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS AT THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT OR EVEN AT 59% WHICH IS UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM LOANS LOANS AS HIGH AS YOU CAN GET IT. RIGHT SIX MINUTES IF WE COULD -- YES CLOSE. OKAY -- SO I SEE LENDERS SUCH AS ONE MAN LANDMARK SUPPORTING THIS BILL IT'S EASY TO COMPARE MY COMPANY BETWEEN MY COMPANY IN ONE MAIN BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH -- PUBLIC COMPANIES THEY REPORT THAT THEIR AVERAGE LOAN SIDE FOR UNSECURED INSTALLMENT IS. SEVEN THOUSAND THAT THEIR AVERAGE CUSTOMER FICUS SCORE SIX THIRTY FIVE THAT THE RABBITS TERMS FIFTY THREE MONTHS THAT'S FOUR AND A HALF YEARS -- OUR AVERAGE IQ SCORE SIX HUNDRED THAT'S THIRTY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE DIFFERENT -- OUR AVERAGE LOAN IS UNDER THREE THOUSAND VERY DIFFERENT CUSTOMER VERY DIFFERENT PRODUCT. ONE OF THE ADDRESS ONE MORE OF THE FACT SHEET ITEMS AND THAT'S A TWENTY SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN OVER FORTY TWO MONTHS IS A TOTAL PAYMENT OF TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO WHAT OUR LOAN IS OUR LOAN IS FORTY TWO MONTHS. AT 132% APR -- I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON LAST MONTH I SHARED WITH HIM THAT ARE IN OUR TO OF ALL OF OUR LOANS ORIGINATED IN. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ABOUT 1% WENT TO THE FULL CONTRACT TERM IN THE AVERAGE TERM WAS ACTUALLY LESS THAN A YEAR. IN PREPARATION FOR TESTIMONY TODAY I WENT BACK AND PULLED UP ALL OF OUR TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LOANS. AND AGAIN AVERAGE LOAN WAS JUST OVER TWENTY SIX HUNDRED AVERAGE PAY BACK WAS FORTY SIX HUNDRED AVERAGE TERM WAS LESS THAN A YEAR. AND ONLY POINT 7% WENT THE FULL CONTRACT TERM OUR CUSTOMERS ARE USING THESE LOANS FOR THE PLAYER TO FOR NINE BUCKS A MONTH THEM. SO I BELIEVE THAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO REFER IMPROVE THE MARKET PLACE FOR NON PRIME CONSUMERS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THREE THINGS THAT WHAT OPTIONS DO NON PRIME CONSUMERS SUB SIX THIRTY FIVE THAT ONE MAIN INLAND MARKER SERVING WHAT DID OPTIONS TO THEY REALLY HAVE. HOW THE USING THOSE HIGH COST LOANS THAT THEY'RE GETTING TODAY PLEASE UNDERSTAND THESE BARGER BEHAVIORS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY THANK YOU -- WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OPPOSITE I'MSORRY AND OPPOSITION I APOLOGIZE. IN OPPOSITION -- NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE.

AS WELL AS CREDIT BUREAUS AND LEE PROVIDERS AS WELL AS SOFTWARE ENGINEERS PEOPLE THAT REALLY HELPED DEVELOP THE ECOSYSTEM FOR ONLINE LANDING. AND THE ONLY THING I'D REALLY LIKE TO ADD HERE IS 36% A PR IS JUST NOT A WORKABLE NUMBER TO COVER THE COST OF LANDING. SO 3% A MONTH IS THE IT SAYS EVEN THOUGH IT SOUNDS GENEROUS IT REALLY ISN'T -- I USED TO BE ONE OF THESE CONSUMERS AND LIKE THE PERSON WHO JUST GOT UP HERE TELL A STORY -- ONCE YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN FINANCIALLY HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON YOU AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND THAT WITH A LENDER WHEN I WAS A WORKING MOTHER WITH TWO CHILDREN AND I HAVE TO SAY WITHOUT THAT ACCESS TO CREDIT I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. SO -- IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU HAVE A CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC AND WHAT IT TAKES TO SERVE THIS CUSTOMER. AND 3% A MONTH JUST DOESN'T WORK THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION ON COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY I AM A LOT OF WHAT I'M HEARING IS THAT THERE'S A DEBATE ABOUT WHAT THIS WILL DO IN THE MARKET. TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL BUT WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIRTY EIGHT STATES THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THE ONE BEFORE US AND SO I'M CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM BOTH SIDES WHAT HAS HAPPENED WE HEARD. TOUCH ON WHAT HAPPENED ORGAN BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENED TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL IN AS OTHER STATES. SO 80% SO LET'S BE CLEAR THIS THIS BILL -- LOOKS AT ONE PRODUCT AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE MORE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET RIGHT AND SO THIS IS REALLY FROM IN THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE 80% OF THE UNITED STATES LIVES WITH A CAP. ON THAT AND IT THERE CONTINUE TO BE OTHER OPTIONS I FEEL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW IS THAT THE REASON THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE MORE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS. AS SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL IS BECAUSE THEY WILL STAY IN BUSINESS -- EIGHT INCLUSIVE WE WE'VE HAD AN ASSEMBLY DELEGATION THAT WAS HERE THAT WENT OUT TO WASHINGTON DC -- THAT ALSO SAYS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT NATION WIDE AT IS BEING LOOKED AT AND FOR CALIFORNIA IS REGULATORY STABILITY KNOWING THAT THIS IS BEEN A DISCUSSION FOR FOURTEEN YEARS IN THE STATE -- AND SO PEOPLE ARE HESITANT AND SHY TO INVEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA UNTIL THEY KNOW WHAT THE RULES WILL BE -- WE HAVE A UNANIMOUS CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION AS HAS BEEN NOTICED THAT CALLED THESE RAZA LOANS UNCONSCIONABLE. AND MEANING THEY DIDN'T QUITE KNOW WHAT THE RATE WOULD BE -- WHAT THE RIGHT RATE WOULD BE BUT THE RATE THAT IS IN EXISTENCE AND THE COMPANY THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THAT COURT CASE -- HAD PRETTY HIGH. NUMBERS AND THEY WERE WELL INTO THE HIGH INTEREST AND SO I THINK WHAT WHAT'S BEING CALLED UPON US AS A STATE IS ONE TO TO DO SOMETHING OTHERWISE THE COURTS WILL DO SOMETHING OR IT WILL BE DONE THROUGH A BALLOT INITIATIVE -- WE'VE LOOKED AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AGAIN IS IT THROUGH THE COUNTRY AND THAT 36% COMES FROM THE MILITARY LANDING ACT WHICH CREATED A STANDARD. PEOPLE CAN DEBATE ON WHETHER THE STANDARD IS THE RIGHT NUMBER OR NOT BUT NONE THE LESS IT'S TREATED THE STANDARD WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH. THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW I'M. I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING EXPLOITED AT THE COST OF US NOT DOING ANYTHING ABOUT NEEDS TO STOP BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT -- ESPECIALLY THE FINTECH SPACE CREATING OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE AREN'T REGULATING AND THAT WHEN PEOPLE NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY WILL TURN TO UNREGULATED MEANS AND THINGS THAT WILL EXPLOIT THEM EVEN FURTHER AND SO I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS. WE NEED TO BE COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT THOSE ALTERNATIVES IN ENSURING THE WERE REGULATING THERE'S AN EQUAL NUMBER MAYOR PROVIDE MORE CONTACTS. HELLO. I'M DR FLAT OKAY QUESTIONNAIRES BUT WHICH ONE THANK VICE CHAIR CHEN. I A REALLY -- APPRECIATE. NOW AUTHORS -- INTENT. TO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY TRYING. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS SO WHO ARE IN NEED [inaudible] BUT I HAVE A QUESTION LISTENING TO OPPOSITION [inaudible] SIDE [inaudible] WHEN? YOU WILL REGULATE THE INTEREST RATE THE 236% WHICH IS A NOT WORKABLE THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE SAYING. SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE TO FORTY THE MEN TO GO ELSEWHERE. AND THE CONSUMERS. WE HAVE OUR BORROWED. AS THE CHART SAYS SO -- MOST. WHAT IS IT? WHAT WAS THE NUMBER HERE THIS HOT NUMBER HOW CAN EVEN RE? ONE WHERE WE'RE AT WITH A COLD -- IF. HELLO KERN MENDES AND CANNOT OPERATE AND THE COST OF THE BUSINESS. THANK YOU DOCTOR CHOI FOR THAT QUESTION -- AS FAR AS WHERE THEY GO BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS -- THE THIRTIES THE 36% INTEREST RATE -- CAP. AND THE THE RESPONSE TO THE 36% IS THAT WHEN THEY SAY THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS. MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHAT WHAT'S THE CAUSE OF A 36% CAP WHERE SOME CAN CAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS BUT THESE PARTICULAR MODELS CAN'T DO BUSINESS. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD BE THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE COVER FOR THE HIGH RATE OF DEFAULTS -- HOWEVER THE SAME COMPANIES ARE SAYING THAT THEY ARE DOING -- A LEVEL OF UNDERWRITING. SO I WOULD I WOULD IMAGINE THAT -- THE MORE DEFAULT YOU HAVE THE HIGHER THE INTEREST RATE MUST BE SO THAT THERE CAN BE A RECOVERY TO KEEP THAT PARTICULAR MODEL WORKING. AS AS THE THE CHAIR MENTIONED THERE ARE A LOT OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE THIS IS NOT GOING TO COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING BUSINESS WHAT IT IS GOING TO DO IS BRING IT TO A PLACE OF A REASONABLE. MODEL FOR BUSINESS THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE OUT A LOAN TO BE ABLE TO REPAY IT AND TO WORK THEMSELVES INTO A PRIME MARKET AND NOT CONTINUE TO BE IN A PERPETUAL. SUBPRIME -- CONDITION AS FAR AS WHERE THEY WILL GO -- THERE ARE GOING TO BE I BELIEVE THIS -- I THINK WE COULD LEARN AS THE EXAMPLE WAS MENTIONED -- BY OPPOSITION ABOUT AN EXAMPLE IN OREGON. AND I THINK THE THE STATE THAT WE HAVE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- REBEKAH BAUER CON I BELIEVE THE THE STATE THAT WE HAVE IS INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE ENOUGH THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY LEARN LESSONS FROM OTHER STATES THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE US. BAND THROUGH TECHNOLOGY AND THROUGH -- THROUGH BETTER ENFORCEMENT WE CAN ACTUALLY HOPE NOT REPEAT THOSE SAME MISTAKES AS FAR AS THEY WHERE WOULD THEY GO I BELIEVE THEY'LL BE PRODUCTS THAT. BECAUSE OF THE CERTAINTY THAT'S PER I DID IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM A. B. A FIGHTER I BELIEVE THIS THAT THERE WILL ACTUALLY BE PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY RISE FROM THIS. FOR A MORE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM. AS A FOLLOW UP QUIRK QUESTION YOU A BAILOUT. FIVE THIRTY NINE IS -- LIMITING THE RATE 236%. YOU ARE NOT REGULATING AS I READ THE THE CREDIT RATING -- CREDIT INSURANCE. IF AND WHEN THEY TRY -- TO MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE Y. LOS. I CREDIT INSURANCE. DO YOU MAY NOT -- ACHIEVED WELL WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE A THROUGH THIS BILL. I'M SORRY WHAT'S THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING THE THE CREDIT INSURANCE AND THEY MAY THEY MAY CHARGE. IN ADDITION TO THE INTEREST RATE AND THE QUESTION IS. WHEN WHAT ABOUT THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT ABOUT THE CREDIT INSURANCE? WHAT WOULD THAT THAT IS A NOT REGULATING REGULATED BY DISPEL AND THAT THEY CAN CHARGE INJURIES ON TOP OF THAT MAYBE MAYBE -- OPPOSITION NOW CAN ANSWER -- TO THAT. ACTUALLY THERE IS A LOT OF EXCUSE NATURE THERE IS A LOT A LOT OF REGULATION ON THAT AND BY THE WAY IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST THE LAW -- TO OFFER ALONE AND THEN REQUIRE THERE HAD TO BE ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE ADDED ON TO IT. SO IT'S AN OPTION NUMBER ONE AND THEN NUMBER TWO THERE ARE -- THERE ARE RATE REGULATIONS THAT IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ON THE INSURANCE PRODUCT ITSELF. SO THAT IF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY. IT WOULD RAISE THE INTEREST RATE -- IF YOU WERE INCLUDING THE ADD ON OR INSURANCE BUT IT WOULD NOT EVEN COME REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT'S BEING OFFERED UP THERE NOW IN THE TRIPLE TRIPLE DIGIT. OKAY VICE CHAIR CAN I ASK OPPOSITION NANA. I HAVE A QUESTION IF WITH 36% IS AND NOT WORKABLE AND NOT BY ABOUT A WEEK. HAVE YOU. A SUGGESTED THE AS A COMPROMISE TO RATE THAT WHAT WILL BE A ON THE SIDE OF A PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS HAVE BUT THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS CAN OPERATE THAT WAS THE ANY COMPROMISE DEVOTION WHAT INTEREST RATE THAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED. ACTUALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI THERE'S BEEN NO DISCUSSION AROUND THAT. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE DPO DATA THERE IS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN LOANS BEING DONE OVER 40% APR. AND WE WILL TALK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE OTHER LENDERS THAT CAN OPERATE AT 36% ARE UNDER THE LENDER SUCH AS ONE MAN AND ONE MARK THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS BILL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT APPLES AND ORANGES SO FIRST OF ALL. THAT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN LOAN VOLUME THAT'S BEING DONE -- OVER 40% APR. THEY CAN THEY CAN BE DOING THAT LOAN VOLUME TODAY IF THEY WANTED TO AND WE WOULD BE OUT OF BUSINESS. BUT THEIR PRODUCT IN THERE CONSUMER IS IN THEIR BUSINESS MODEL ISVERY DIFFERENT FROM OURS SO TO THINK THAT IF WE'RE NOT HERE LENDING TO OUR CUSTOMERS THAT OTHER LENDERS. CAN STEP IN AND LEAD TO THOSE. CUSTOMERS THAT ARE DEEPER IN THE FIGHT GOES SCORE RANGE AT 36% OR LESS THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN [inaudible] SO WITH. IF AND WHEN -- THIS PASSES. WHAT DO YOU? PREDICT. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE MARKET THE OF HIS CELL. PHONE FIVE HUNDRED TWO TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR MARK THAT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN LOAN VOLUME TODAY THAT'S BEEN DONE AT OVER 40% APR FIRST THOSE SUB PRIME. NAM CONSUMERS IT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE PICKED UP BY OTHER STATE LICENSED LENDERS THEY'RE GOING TO BE PICKED UP BY -- TRIBAL LENDERS WHICH IS A VALID MODEL BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SOVEREIGN NATION -- OR THEY'RE GOING TO GO TO OFF SHORE ILLEGAL LENDERS. FOR THE USE OVERDRAFT OR THEY'RE GONNA YES THERE'S A A NUMBER OF SUBSTITUTE THINGS THAT COULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MOST ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. THANK YOU VITAL KERR AS A MATTER OF JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY ASK SOME OF THE SUPPORT TO ALSO JOIN US AT THE TABLE SINCE RATE THE DISCUSSION NOW SO WOMEN. HAVE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL. AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH OF YOU WOULD LIKE FOR GONNA NEED. YEAH IT'S GOT. WE'RE GONNA NEED ONE OF YOU TO TRANSITION SO WE CAN HAVE US SUPPORT AT THE TABLE AS WELL AUTONOMOUS STATUS. THANK YOU MISTER VICE STRIVE TO QUESTIONS WITH YOUR PERMISSION ONE TO THE OPPOSITION AND WENT TO THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL SO. I'M JUST TO PICK UP FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE EAST BAY I THINK SHASTA NECK SOME QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS INFORMATION WE CAN SEE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT AN ERROR IN WHICH CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THAT THAT A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES HAVE GONE BEFORE. US AND HAVE -- ENACTED. SIMILAR OR IN FACT MORE STRINGENT REGULATIONS IT SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY IT -- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE SEEN HAPPEN IN THIS OTHER STATES WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT LENDERS EXITING THE MARKET ABOUT A LACK OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR CERTAIN FOLKS. IS THAT TO ME THAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN THOSE OTHER STATES AND IF SO CAN YOU DESCRIBE THAT IN SOME DETAIL ABSOLUTELY. SO I HAVE A CHART WHICH I PROVIDED TO EACH ONE OF YOUR CHIEFS OF STAFF -- PART OF THIS HEARING I'LL JUST GO DOWN THE LIST HERE -- SO YOU HAVE THE ECONOMIC EFFECT OF STORES CLOSING STOREFRONTS CLOSING IN ARIZONA -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY STOREFRONT LOCATIONS OFFERING THIS IS PAY DAY LOANS -- THAT CLOSED -- WITH REGARD TO OREGON IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN IT EXTENDED THAT 36% RATE CAPS. TO CAR TITLE LENDERS AND INTERNET LENDERS OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. AGAINST UNREGULATED INTERNET LENDERS DOUBLED AND NEARLY 70% OF SUCH COMPLAINTS FILED IN TWENTY TEN WERE AGAINST UNREGULATED ONLINE LENDERS NOW -- I ALSO HAVE SPECIFIC STUDIES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THAT SO THAT WE CAN JUST MAKE THIS UP A JUST SO YOU KNOW -- AND HAPPY DO AGAIN ALREADY HAVE SHARED WITH YOU CHOOSE -- WHICH IS THIS CHART RIGHT HERE OKAY THAT WE PUT TOGETHER I WAS VERY METICULOUS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT OUR FAX RECORD -- IN SOUTH DAKOTA -- IT STATES THAT MOST CONSUMERS TURN TO ONLINE. UNREGULATED LENDERS. THAT WAS IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN I CAN GO ON SOME OF SEE HERE. WHEN THE GOES BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK? STUDY. THAT WAS DONE THE SAID -- PEOPLE BOUNCE MORE CHECKS COMPLAIN MORE ABOUT LENDERS AND DEBT COLLECTORS IN A FILE CHAPTER SEVEN BANKRUPTCY AT A HIGHER RATE -- AND I'LL DO ONE LAST ONE WHICH WAS IN GEORGIA -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR IT'S A FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK STUDY REPORTS THAT PEOPLE THE HOUSE MORE CHECKS COMPLAIN MORE ABOUT -- ONLINE LENDERS AND DEBT COLLECTORS SO DEBT COLLECTORS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE. THANK YOU I I APOLOGIZE I DON'T I HAVEN'T SEEN THE TURN IF THEY THINK A NUMBER OF FOLKS -- HAVEN'T SEEN AS WELL OKAY BUT I DID SEND IT JUST SO YOU KNOW OKAY I'VE I'VE I'M I'M SURE THAT THAT'S TRUE -- I GUESS WE'LL JUST A FALL QUESTION WHAT DO WE KNOW IT DID THE TOTAL. VOLUME OF LANDING DECREASE OUR FOLKS -- SUBSTITUTING TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR DO WE HAVE ANY EVIDENCE TO MOUNT THE SUBSTITUTING OTHER PRODUCT OKAY DO HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE NATURE OF THOSE PRODUCTS WERE. PRETTY MUCH -- ONLINE AND UNREGULATED INTERNET LENDERS GOT IT OKAY. WAS IS THERE A STUDY OF FOR THAT RESULTS AS THOSE THAT GET IT I MEAN THAT THEY WENT TO UNREGULATED -- LOANS AND INDUSTRY. FOR THAT. BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF WE HAD DATA TO SHOW THAT THE TRANSITION FROM SMALL DOLLAR LENDING TO UNREGULATED. LENDING TWO WEEKS. THERE THERE ARE STUDIES FROM DIFFERENT STATES THAT TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS TO CONSUMERS AFTER. OF RESTRICTIVE RATE CAPS IN. YOU MAY NOT HAVE -- CURIOSITY TO DO THIS FOR SOME TIME BUT IT'S NOT GOOGLE A SMALL DOLLAR LOAN OR PAYDAY LOAN IN NEW YORK AND SEE HOW MANY. LENDERS YOU HAVE COME UP ON YOUR SEARCH HAD VERY HIGH RATES. THEY'RE THERE AND THEY'RE OVER MEMBERS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ALSO TO ADD JUST QUOTING WHAT WAS JUST SAID AB IT WAS DESCRIBED AS PAYDAY LENDING THIS IS A THAT'S ONE OF THE PRODUCTS THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL WITH PAYDAY LENDING. THIS IS SMALL DOLLAR LANDING THREE HUNDRED UNDER SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COMPARE -- THAT FOR YOU KNOW APPLES TO APPLES THERE ARE MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE PRODUCTS AND THE THREE HUNDRED UNDER. IS NOT BEING IMPACTED BY THIS BILL AND THAT IS PAID A THANK YOU THINK THINK YOU'RE MUCH OF JUST BECAUSE SOME MEMBERS I I'M JUST ASKING QUESTIONS I DON'T NOW -- YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THIS INFORMATION I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT RELEVANT OUR CONVERSATION TO SEE WHAT THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER. OF OTHER STATES HAS BEEN -- JUST A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS I I AGREE A 100% WITH OUR CHAIR THAT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS WE HAVEN'T I THINK AN OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY TO THE MARKET -- AND TO SHOW YOU KNOW TRYING TO PROMOTE REGULATORY CERTAINTY SO FOLKS CAN INVESTORS I'M JUST CURIOUS -- AS WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SETTING THAT NUMBER WHAT. WHAT WAS THE IMPETUS BEHIND 36% SO THIRTY SIX IS BASED ON THE MILITARY LENDING ACT IT'S ON A STANDARD A THINK THERE COULD BE A LOT OF DEBATE ON WHETHER THAT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER OR NOT BUT IT CREATED A STANDARD FOR THE UNITED STATES? AND WHAT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT DOES IT ALLOWS ACTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR MILITARY TO GET A LOAN AT 36% IN AN EMERGENCY IN A TIME OF NEED AND SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS EXTEND THAT. AND IT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS 36% PLUS THE FEDERAL FEE WHICH WILL CHANGE SLIGHTLY DEPENDING ON THE ECONOMY PLUS THE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR APPLICATION FEE. AND AS IT'S BEEN NOTED THERE COULD BE INSURANCE BUT THAT THE LAW IS VERY CLEAR THAT IT IS A LEGAL FOR LENDER TO MAKE A LOAN THAT IS CONTINGENT UPON A BAR ACCEPTING ANY KIND OF SEPARATE PRODUCT. THERE IS ALREADY A LAW IN PLACE FOR THAT SO IF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT -- WE I THINK LAST YEAR I MEAN FIRST THE LEGISLATURE'S BEEN TRYING TO REGULATE THE SPACE FOR FOURTEEN YEARS THERE'S A FEW ELEMENTS THAT HAVE CHANGE FOR OUR STATE ONE WE HAVE A CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION. ON THAT TO US WAS CALLED LAST YEAR THAT SAID THAT THESE RATES ARE UNCONSCIONABLE. IT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE NUMBER WHERE WE ALSO CAN LOOK EVEN RIGHT NOW AT THIS MOMENT THAT WHEN. THE LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ACT THE G. JUST SYSTEM WILL STEP IN AND WILL CREATE A LOAN FROM TALKING TO AVERAGE FOLKS -- ON ANY SIDE OF THE AISLE 36% STILL SOUNDS HIGH TO SOME FOLKS -- AND SO WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT YOUR AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WILL THINK LINE. BECAUSE WE FEEL THAT IS STILL IMPORTANT TO PROVIDE SOME OPTION TO PEOPLE IN AN EMERGENCY CRISIS WE CAME UP WITH THIS NEGOTIATED PRODUCT WHAT YOU SAW LAST YEAR WAS A BILL THAT WAS SIMILAR BUT NOT IDENTICAL. I'M AND FOR US YOU KNOW ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS I DID WHEN I CAME INTO THIS ROLE AND AND LOOKED AT THE SPACES ASKED -- AS THEY THINK WAS WAS ASKED BY DOCTOR CHOI AND THERE WAS NO ANSWER GIVEN WHICH WAS WHAT WOULD BE THE MAGIC PERCENTAGE. AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT NO ONE HAD A MAGIC PERCENTAGE AND THEREFORE THESE HIGH INTEREST -- TO THAT WOULD BE PERPETUATED OUR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND REALLY AROUND THE COUNTRY FEEL THAT THESE ARE NOT ACCEPTABLE -- WE HAVE USURY LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A REASON -- WE DON'T LIKE IT WHEN CREDIT CARDS ARE OVER EIGHTEEN OR 28% WELL THIS IS A PRODUCT THAT AGAIN. I HAVE PEOPLE INCLUDING CONSUMER GROUPS WHO WOULD LIKE US TO PUSH MORE AND TO GO FURTHER WHO THINK HIGH. AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE MEMBERS OF INDUSTRY THAT THINK 36% IS NEVER GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO GET THEM THERE. THIS IS WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DOES WE TRIED TO FIND A PLACE AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES WHO FEEL THIS IS NOT THE IDEAL AN IDENTICAL PLACE BUT THIS IS WHERE WE'VE LANDED AFTER MONTHS. OF CONVERSATIONS MONTHS OF CONVERSATION SIXTEEN MONTHS SINCE JANUARY SINCE I BECAME THE OFFICIAL CHAIR OF CONVERSATIONS WITH ALL FOLKS ABOUT THIS -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT VERY GREAT THAT WE CAN'T YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T FEEL GREAT THAT ALL SIDES CAN'T COME TO THIS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE'VE LANDED AFTER A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS -- AND CERES COMPROMISE AND NEGOTIATION AND WE THINK THAT THIS IS WHERE OUR STATE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WHETHER. NOW I WANT -- TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A QUITE A JOURNEY IN IT I THINK I MAY HAVE. BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE LONGER THAN ANYONE -- IS THAT THE LAST SIX YEARS. AND IS MY SEVENTH YEAR ON THIS COMMITTEE. WE HAVE WRESTLED WITH THIS ISSUE FOR THE ENTIRE TIME I HAVE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE. IT IS NOT AN EASY ISSUE AND ESPECIALLY WHEN I KNOW THE WE'RE DEALING WITH -- COMMUNITIES OF CHALLENGE OF WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY. LIVES IN MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT HAVE SOMETIMES ENTERED INTO THESE RELATIONSHIPS WITH VARIOUS COMPANIES AND THE UNFORTUNATE THING IS MOST OF THE TIME WHEN WHEN I GOT WHEN I FIRST GOT ON COMMITTEE WE HAD A LOT OF HEARINGS WE HAD PEOPLE WHO CAME AND TOLD THEIR STORIES. AND MOST OF THE TIME THERE WERE STORIES OF HORROR I MEAN THEY WERE REALLY PEOPLE WHO HAD. WHO HAD NEEDS BUT AS A RESULT OF ENGAGING IN THESE KIND OF CREDIT THE -- ONCE A PREDATORY THESE LENDING COMPANIES ARE ENDED UP EVEN IN WORSE CONDITION BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY WERE. INVESTING INTO WHETHER IT WAS THE THIS PARTICULAR LOAN AWARE THERE WAS A CAR LOANS OR WHATEVER WE WE DID WALL WITH THE WAS A PAYDAY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND AND IN EACH CASE MOST OF THE TIME THEY ENDED UP IN WORSE PLACES THAT MADE THEM WHAT WE WOULD LIKE FOR THEM TO BE. AND AND I IN A YOU KNOW IT AND THE FIRST I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT UNTIL I BEGAN TO REALLY EXAMINE -- WHERE WE ALL ARE AS A STATE IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE? AND RECOGNIZE THAT ALMOST ALL OF THESE PLACES ARE LOCATED IN A VERY POOR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT ALMOST EVERY TIME I LOOKED UP IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I LIVE AND WORK IN. THERE WAS A A PLACE POPPING UP THAT WAS DOING THESE KINDS OF LOANS OR WHETHER WAS PAYDAY LOANS CAR LOANS WHATEVER IT WAS. AND UP AND AND PEOPLE WERE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF THAT AND AND I THINK WHAT ALSO HAPPENED WAS. I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT AS LONG AS WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. IT SETS THE BEHAVIOR A WITH REGARDS TO HOW WE LOOK AT ALL LENDING HOW WE LOOK AT MANAGEMENT OF OUR RESOURCES AND NOT THAT THESE FOLKS HAVE A WEALTH. BUT THE FACT THAT -- YOU KNOW I COME FROM A FAMILY OF OF OF CHALLENGE. IN YET OUR BECAUSE THESE WERE AVAILABLE IN THOSE DAYS PEOPLE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE BUT LONG AS WE HAVE PAID A LOANS OR WHATEVER THEY MAY BE. PEOPLE GO EVERY OTHER MONTH LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO FILL IN THE GAP AND EVENTUALLY YOU GET CAUGHT. BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING TOO FAR AWAY FROM WHERE YOU WERE ONCE WORK. AND NOW YOU ARE OVERWHELMED BY THE VARIOUS KINDS OF PRODUCTS THAT YOU ENGAGED IN. AND AND IT JUST BRINGS TREMENDOUS TRAGEDY IN PEOPLE'S LIVES WE'VE SEEN IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO I I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE MOST OF THIS IS A COMFORTABLE PLACE TO BE. BUT I THINK -- WHEN I THINK OF CALIFORNIA I ALWAYS THINK OF THIS PLACE OF? HOPE OF BEING PROGRESSIVE BEING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUALS YOU KNOW HAVING A SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO KIND OF BILL FAMILIES AND BILL INDIVIDUALS. AND YET WE HAVE BECOME FAR AWAY FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I HAD AS A KID AND COMING TO THE STATE THAT WE'RE NOW IN IN THAT IN ONE OF THOSE SPACES THAT I DON'T LIKE BEING IN. WHEN I LOOK AT THIS LIST OF THOSE IN AND AND THE PERCENTAGES I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA IS HANGING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM WITH VERY LITTLE REGULATION OR NO REGULATION IN SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS? AND WE'RE AND WE'RE FINDING THAT PEOPLE ARE POOR THAN BEFORE. AND WOULD SOMEHOW KNOW THE DIGGING EVEN DEEPER HOLES OF POVERTY -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS THE THE 36% I MEAN AND AND WE SEE THAT THAT'S AND AND IS THERE MAINLY BECAUSE MOST OF OUR MILITARY FAMILIES WERE WORDS CONSTANTLY GOING IN GETTING LOANS AND AND THEY DISCOVERED. THAT IT WAS HAVING AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR MILITARY -- WHO PEOPLE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES AND SO THEY THEN STEPPED IN AND SAID OKAY WE CAN'T ALLOW THIS TO CONTINUE TO HAPPEN BECAUSE? YOU KNOW THE KIND OF ACTIVITY OCCURRING WAS JUST REALLY DESTROYING THE MORALE OF THE INDIVIDUALS IT WAS A STRONG A FINANCES THEIR STABILITY THE CURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND GOES ON AND ON UNTIL THE GOVERNMENT STEPPED IN AND SAID OKAY THIS IS NOT HAPPENING MORE. FOR THE MILITARY -- IN AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO SAY THE SAME THING -- IT REALLY IS A LIVE IN THOSE OF US WHO VALUE OUR OUR ECONOMICS NO THAT'S A THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT FOR LOANS YOU KNOW WE WE WE WE LOOK AT OUR CREDIT CARD AMOUNTS AND FOLKS OF STARTING ELIMINATING CREDIT CARDS IN THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THE PERCENTAGES SO HIGH -- WE HAD TO TELL PEOPLE THIS IS WHAT YOU BE BORROWED MONEY WITH THIS CREDIT CARD THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO COST YOU. AND IF YOU'RE LIKE MOST OF US WHO JUST LIKE I'M YOU MORE CREDIT CARDS I NEED TO LIMIT THAT BECAUSE WHY BECAUSE IT'S WHEN YOU REALIZE WHAT IT IS AND WE WERE IN A CREDIT CARD GENERATION. WE HAD ALL OF US HAD JUST HUGE NUMBERS OF CREDIT CARD EVERY STORE EVERYWHERE YOU GO YOU HAVE A CREDIT CARD BUT YOU BEGIN TO REALIZE THIS EIGHTEEN OF 28% OF WHATEVER IT WAS. AND YOU PAYING MINIMAL TO DO IT YOU'LL NEVER GET OUT OF DEBT YOU KNOW YOU BY ADDRESS IT IS GOING TO CST YOU OF THE DRESS IS ALREADY IN PHONE AWAY AND YOU STILL CAN'T. FOR AND SO -- SO WE WE WE'VE BEGUN TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF INFORMATION WE DISCOVER WE BEGIN THIS IDEA BEGIN TO CHANGE MY BEHAVIOR WITH THE USE OF THIS MAINLY BECAUSE OF THAT. PEOPLE WILL SOMETIMES A JUSTIN CHANGE IF THEY HAVE. TO AND AS I LOOK AT THIS I REALIZE IT IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. BUT IF WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP PEOPLE CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR WE TALK ALL THE TIME ABOUT POVERTY IN THE STATE. AND HOW WE OF CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS HUGE GAP OF POVERTY AND IT DOESN'T COME EASY FOR PEOPLE TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR SO THIS IS TO ME THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE. TO KIND OF FINALLY BITE THE BULLET ON YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN IT IF SOME OF YOU BEEN HERE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS SEVEN YEARS LISTENING TO THIS. AND GRAPPLING WITH THAT IN TRYING TO ASK MYSELF AM I DOING MORE HARM TO PEOPLE POOR BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL THEY DON'T HAVE SOMEBODY YOU KNOW THEY'LL HAVE FAMILIES THAT THE LOAN THE MONEY IF ON AND ON AND ON AND AND THEN I CAME TO THE REALIZATION. THAT I COME FROM A FAMILY THAT DIDN'T HAVE MONEY THAT PEOPLE COULD LONGER. AT AND AS A RESULT OF THAT MY FAMILY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WATCH CAREFULLY WHAT WE DID INVEST IN THINGS THAT WITH THEIR AND WE NEVER HAD A HUGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS. BUT WE HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIDN'T DIG A HOLE FOR OURSELVES THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IN THAT WE WERE ALREADY POOR BUT WE DON'T WANT YOU POINT AND WHAT WE WORK. SO I YOU KNOW I SAID WITH THIS I KNOW THAT YOU WRESTLE WITH THIS FOR THAT WHEN YOU BECAME CHAIR HE WHO SAID YOU'RE GOING TO STOP IN THIS SPACE NOT LIKE ALL MY GOD THIS YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. DO YOU KNOW DO YOU KNOW WHERE THIS LEADS US AND BUT I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED THAT AT LEAST THEY FOUND A STANDARD THAT THAT THAT THAT IS WORK FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AS WORK FOR THE MILITARY AND IN GOOD CONSCIENCE I HAVE TO SAY LET ME SEE IF THIS WORKS A CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I'D. THANK YOU ALWAYS FUN TO GO AFTER DOCTOR SHIRLEY WEBER CAN ASSURE YOU -- FOR THE LENDERS DO YOU DO BUSINESS IN ANY OTHER STATES. WE OPERATE IN TWENTY SEVEN STATES -- SO DO YOU OPERATE IN ANY OF THE STATES THAT HAVE. LOWER THAN 36% INTEREST RATES -- THERE'S YES WE DO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T PREPARE THAT CHART AND WHAT'S ON THAT CHART IS JUST THE INTEREST RATE CAP IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FEES ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGES AND OTHER THINGS PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE STATUTE THE STATUTES ARE. PRETTY COMPLICATED AND THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE REFLECTION. GOT IT BUT SO YOU DO YOU DO BUSINESS IN OTHER STATES THAT. HAVE A 36% OR LOWER INTEREST RATE AND YOU'D GIVE LOANS OF RT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND R. APR IS HIGHER THAN MAY BE THAT BUT IT IT HAS OTHER PERMISSIBLE FEES AND CHARGES THAT GETS THE AP UP UP TO A LEVEL THAT WE CAN HAVE A VIABLE PRODUCT FOR NON PRIME CONSUMERS. SORRY ABLE TO DO ANY LOANS. OF HELLO 36% EVEN WITH THOSE NO WE DON'T BY COMPANY OPERATES IN TWENTY SEVEN STATES ALL JUST NOT MISS TO BE REALLY CLEAR WE DO NOT OFFER ANY LOANS AT 36% APR OR LOWER. OKAY. WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I FULLY SUPPORTED I THINK IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE WE HAVEN'T ACTED ON IT YET I KNOW IT'S NOT BEEN EASY PROCESS SO I WILL BE FULLY WHOLEHEARTEDLY. VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU AND I DID WANT TO SEE AT IN LIGHT OF YOUR COMMENT -- TO IF MR GOVERNOR HAD ANY THING HE WANTED TO ADD IN TERMS OF THE COMPANIES THE LENDERS YOU REPRESENT AND ADDING TO THIS -- ONLY IN SO MUCH AS OBVIOUS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN AROUND QUITE SOME TIME. THEY DO -- ISSUE LOANS AT THIRTY SIX AND BELOW THESE ARE SELF IMPOSED CAPS GENERALLY. AND TO THE EXTENT SOME OF THESE COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO PULL PEOPLE OUT OF THE HIGHER INTEREST LOANS. THOSE BORROWERS ACTUALLY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE LOANS IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THE NOTION THAT THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IS GOING TO DRY UP. IS ACTUALLY INCORRECT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE CONSUMERS IN THAT SPACE WITH THEM QUALIFY. FOR THESE LOANS A PILOT PROGRAM LOANS PERSONALLY REFERENCE EARLIER SO THAT PART OF THE MARKET THOSE CONSUMERS WOULD STILL HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU. THIS IS THE MOST AWKWARD COMMITTEE ROOM TO TESTIFY IN ISN'T IT BECAUSE INEVITABLY SOMEBODY BEHIND YOU WANTS TO TALK TO YOU. OKAY SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS YOUR FIRST ON ON THE OUTSET LET ME SAY THAT -- I APPRECIATE AND RESPECT I WHAT THE AUTHORS ARE TRYING TO DO LIKE I GET WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS -- WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS? OKAY WHAT'S. WHAT'S THE DAY WHO CAN ANSWER WHAT THE DEFAULT RATE IS ON THESE TYPES OF LOANS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT ABOUT 36%. WHAT THE DEFAULT RATE? IT IS GONNA VERY I CAN TELL YOU ON AVERAGE ARE DEFAULT RATE OF THE TWO COMPANIES I REPRESENT. IS 20% WHICH MEANS 80% OF PEOPLE ARE RIPPING THOSE LOANS. OKAY. 20% DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD. YES SOME REMEMBER BLIND AS I PULLED UP AT TEN K. FROM A LARGE ONLINE WONDER. THAT REPORTS A 52% CHARGE OFF RATE. OKAY SO THAT'S ONLINE LENDERS CORRECT THAT'S A REGULATED. RIGHT OKAY REGULATED OKAY SAID THERE'S SOME VARIATION YOU'RE SAYING 20% YOU'RE SAYING SOME AT WELL YES -- AND I THINK. THE HOME JUST KEEP IT BRIEF PEOPLE CONFUSE. DEFAULT CHARTER FREIGHT LOAN LOSSES -- PERHAPS WHAT MR GOVERNOR'S LOOKING AT IS OUR GAP ACCOUNTING PUBLIC RECORDS THAT SHOW KIND OF THE CHARGE OFF RATES -- OURS ARE LOAN LOSSES IN OUR PUBLIC FILINGS FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WERE 40% -- ONE MAIN WAS 25% THAT'S AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON FOR YOU. THAT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TYPES OF CONSUMERS THAT WE SERVE OKAY SO WE HAVE A VARIETY THEN I WOULD SAY OF A DEFAULT RATES THAT'S FINE -- SO THEN. TOO I GUESS TO THE AUTHORS -- WHERE WHERE ARE THE CONSUMERS IF THEY CAN'T GET THIS TYPE OF LOAN? WHERE WILL THEY GO? SO THEY THERE ARE STILL OTHER PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET AND THIS LOAN LIKE WILL LIKE WHAT PAYDAY. IS STILL IN THE MARKET THE PILOT PROGRAM STILL IN THE MARKET AND THIS LOAN THE 250-021-0000 IS STILL IN THE MARKET AT A DIFFERENT RATE. THAT'S NOT GOING AWAY EXCEPT OKAY EXCEPT IT'S NOT -- I GUESS IF YOU TAKE. IF YOU HAVE AB AND C. COMPANIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT AND YOU TAKE AWAY BE IN SEEING A LAMP A LOT THEN THERE'S PROBABLY LESS TO GO AROUND AND THAT WAS BEFORE RIGHT. ATTY JUST OR COULD BE LESS ALTHOUGH I CAN TELL YOU THAT FROM OUR CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW WITH OTHER FOLKS IN THE COUNTRY THEY WANT REGULATORY STABILITY AND THERE MAY BE OTHER FOLKS TO INVEST IN CALIFORNIA ONCE THEY KNOW WHAT THE MARKET'S GOING TO BE. I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT BUT FROM CONVERSATIONS I'VE HAD OKAY SO I'M [inaudible] HERE'S I'M OUT WITH THIS NUMBER ONE WE HAVE HAD -- A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT. THAT THIS IS PREDATORY TYPE OF LENDING AND THAT IT'S IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO CONSUMERS. AND THERE IS A REASON WHY. EVEN THOUGH IT MAY M EXPENSIVE TO US THEN WHY WOULD ANYONE GO IN SEARCH OF THIS TYPE OF LOAN PEOPLE STILL DO IT. RIGHT EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS. LIKE THE ONES THAT YOU YOU KNOW SUGGESTED THEY'RE STILL DOING IT. SO ALL RIGHT SO THERE'S A NEED OUT THERE WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THAT OR NOT. BUT CALIFORNIA IS NUMBER ONE IN POVERTY. THERE'S A REASON PEOPLE NEED THESE TYPES OF ONCE AND IT IS NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER IF THE POLICIES PUT IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA DID MAKE IT SO EXPENSIVE. PEOPLE WOULD NEED THESE TYPES OF LOANS THE AVERAGE RENT OF A STUDIO APARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO IT'S I THINK IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO MAKE THE VILLAINS OUT TO BE THE PEOPLE THE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE LOANS. THAT PEOPLE ARE SEEKING BECAUSE IT'S SO EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU THAT -- PEOPLE GET INTO THESE TYPES OF LOANS AND MAYBE DON'T REALIZE EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GETTING INTO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DO THOUGH -- I'VE HAD MEMBERS OF MY OWN FAMILY WHO ABUSED THESE TYPES OF LOAN PRODUCTS IN A PAY THEM OFF. NO IN IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME THEY DIDN'T DON'T WANT TO END UP. YOU KNOW SPENDING FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS ON A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN SOME PEOPLE DO. BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO INJECT INTO THIS CONVERSATION PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR IN AGREEING TO THAT. AND AS DOCTOR WEBER SUGGESTED YOU KNOW THERE WAS A TIME IN OUR LIVES WHERE. IF YOU COULDN'T AFFORD SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T BUY IT. I MEAN. YEAH BUT WE WE CAN'T LEGISLATE HOW -- BEHAVE I THINK WE'RE BEYOND THAT POINT SO I I SEE A I SEE A NUMBER I SEE THE CALIFORNIA BUT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE A CALIFORNIA HISPANIC CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THE ORANGE COUNTY HISPANIC. I SEE A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS HERE THAT REPRESENT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THEY'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL LIKELY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THEY REPRESENT. WANT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS FOR RED GREEN WITH THAT OR NOT AND THAT GIVES ME PAUSE -- SO I GUESS I WILL IN MY COMMENTS WITH THAT. AND I JUST WANT TO GO ON RECORD WITH SAYING THAT WHILE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS FAITH BASED GROUPS VETERANS GROUPS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT UNDER REPRESENTED -- COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE THAT ARE ALSO IN FAVOR OF THE BILL SO I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE NOTED -- AS WELL AND I YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING ABOUT POVERTY BECAUSE I ALSO THINK THAT -- THIS CANNOT. THIS PRODUCT CANNOT MASK ARE NEED AS THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS POVERTY AND THIS WILL NOT GET US OUT OF POVERTY BY OFFERING THIS PRODUCT AND AND I THINK THAT THAT IS A BIGGER CONVERSATION -- AND CERTAINLY ONE THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE DO AS A STATE -- BUT THIS REALLY CANNOT SERVE AS A MASS FOR AT THE GREATER ISSUE AND THE UNDERLYING ISSUE WHICH IS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN POVERTY AND THERE IS. I THINK MERIT TO WHETHER OR NOT -- THIS MAKES IT THE OPTION WORSE OR BETTER AND WE YOU KNOW THE BECAUSE THE PRODUCT IS STILL GONNA EXIST BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL MULTIPLE PRODUCTS ON THE MARKET. AND WE'VE COME TO THE POINT WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY MOVING US IN A BETTER DIRECTION. THANK YOU SIR. THE CONCERN WITH THE WAY THAT THAT LOANS HAVE BEEN STRUCTURED THE STATE OVER A LONG TIME THAT THE NATURE OF THE PREDATORY ASPECTS OF THEM IS TWO FOLD AND ONE IS A NEWS IN. JUST A STUNNINGLY HIGH. INTEREST RATES THAT HOLD PEOPLE INTO THE CYCLES OF DAD OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE PREDATORY NATURE IS THE WAY THAT THEY'RE ADVERTISED AND I WOULD HOPE IT PEOPLE WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THAT THAT GET PRESENTED AND IF YOU -- TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT YOU'RE TAKING OUT. AND YOU END UP PAYING BACK. THAT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PLUS TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INTEREST. THAT SHOULD WAKE SOME FOLKS UP UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T BECAUSE THERE THEY FEEL THAT THAT THESE ARE THE ONLY OPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED TO THEM AND THAT ARE AVAILABLE I THINK IF WE CAN. BE AS SMART HERE AND PUT A LEGITIMATE CAP AND LOOK AT IT TAKE OFF THE TABLE LOANS THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO PERPETUATE POVERTY. AND THEN THROUGH STRUCTURES LIKE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND REALLY WORKING HARD ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE FINANCIAL LITERACY AND AT A MORE APPROPRIATE PRODUCTS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE AND THEN IT SEEMS A LITTLE HARD TO BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING AT THAT LEVEL. AT LEAST LOOKING WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO DO WITH RESPECT TO MILITARY FOLKS IN AND THEY THEY SAID THE 36% THAT BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT GONNA CHARGE. OUR PEOPLE PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY BEYOND 36% BECAUSE THAT'S UNCONSCIONABLE THAT'S THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. STANCE ON THIS AND NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH OTHER STATES ENCOURAGE OTHER PROD PRODUCTS AND YES THERE MAY BE SOME. COMPANIES WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO MAKE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK OTHERS WELL AND WE HAVE PLENTY WHO ARE. MAKING THOSE AVAILABLE NOW THERE ARE OPTIONS WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THOSE OPTIONS AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE HELPING TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT PERPETUATING. THIS IS THE OLD COMPANY STORE STANDARD THAT WERE FIGHTING AGAINST SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AND WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT ANYMORE. SO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING DEBATE WE HAD A GREAT HEARING. LAST WEEK FROM THE CFPB WHO GAVE US THE NATION WIDE PERSPECTIVE ON LOANS AND LOANS AMOUNTS AND INTEREST RATES. FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THEY WERE. TRYING TO REGULATED AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT THEY WERE TAKING SOME OF THE WORST ACTORS. OFF OF THE THE STAGE THAT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FORTUNATELY THEY'RE NO LONGER ABLE TO DO THAT SINCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STEPPING COMPLETELY AWAY WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE CRITICAL. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STEP UP TO PROTECT OUR OWN CITIZENS. SOMEONE OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHORS AND A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD WE THOUSANDS QUESTIONS WITH. YOU MADAM CHAIR AND ALSO A USING WOMEN GRAYSON AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT IN THIS BILL WAS SOMETHING I HAD TO GRAPPLE WITH. FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME -- MY QUESTION IS. SOMETHING THAT YOU GRAPPLE FOR A LONG TIME 236% APR AS I UNDERSTAND IT THOUGH IT TAKES HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS. EVEN THAT 36% BY ITSELF IT IS A NUMBER THE ULTIMATELY IS THERE'S NO FORMULA. TO IT I HEARD THE CLOSEST THING WAS 3% TIMES -- TWELVE HAS THERE BEEN SESSIONS OF MATURE THERE HAVE BEEN IN TERMS OF IS THERE A WAY IN WHICH THE OVERALL WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE. GATHERED AT IS THERE A NUMBER IN WHICH THERE'S POSSIBLE THAT IS AGREEABLE TO THE OPPOSITION THEY CAN WORK WITH TO HAVE THEIR FINANCIAL BUSINESS MODEL. WORK FOR THEM WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CERTAINLY THE CLIENT -- SO THEY'LL BE MY MY FIRST QUESTION. THANK YOU VICE CHAIR OF GEN AND IF I MAY OF FOR SO JUST POINT OUT THAT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT WAS ACTUALLY PASSED UNDER A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT. AND THIS IS THIS IS AND SHOULD BE A BIPARTISAN ISSUE ABOUT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. I THINK YOU'VE -- AND AND HAVE HEARD -- BY A MULTIPLE FOLKS AND IN TESTIMONY. THAT -- THERE WAS NO MAGIC NUMBER THERE WASN'T ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO TO TRY TO FIND THAT THAT SWEET SPOT OTHER THAN. CONSIDER WHAT WAS ALREADY WORKING. AND WE DON'T KNOW OF ANOTHER NUMBER WILL WORK BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT 36% DOES WORK. IT WORKS FOR OUR MILITARY AND SO WITH THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE PRIMARY MAIN REASONS WHY WE CHOSE. TO FOLLOW SUIT OF SOMETHING THAT ALREADY WORKS KNOWING THAT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE ISN'T WORKING. THANK YOU. THE ACTUALLY OF I'VE HAD SOME CONSTITUENTS CONTACT ME -- TO MY DISTRICT OFFICE OF YOUR PHONE ALSO VIA MAIL THAT THEY'RE CLAIMING AND THEY'RE STATING THAT. ONCE THIS. GOES AWAY THIS ONE POINT THREE BILLION ACCESS TO CAPITAL -- THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER HAVING THE ABILITY. TO FUNCTION AS A BUSINESSMAN IS IT YOUR INTENT THAT THE NEW BUSINESS MODEL WILL BE CREATED AND THAT NUMBER TWO IS TO CURB BEHAVIOR TO DO NEEDLESS SPENDING AND LOAN DEBTS. SO I THINK THAT THE SO. A THING MISTER GOVERNOR ACTUALLY MENTIONED THAT THE ONE POINT -- THREE THAT MAY NOT BE SERVED BY THE HIGH INTEREST LENDERS A BUT IT COULD STILL BE SERVED BY OTHERS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REALITIES -- AND I THINK THE INTENT IS. TO IDENTIFY WAYS THAT WE CAN PERPETUATE RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS MODEL ON THAT ALSO SERVES AS THE CONSUMERS BUT STILL KEEPS THE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. THANK YOU MANAGER OF MY LAST QUESTIONS TO THE OPPOSITION. AND YOU I GUESS MY ULTRA QUESTIONS TO DR PAUL IF YOU WILL WHY IS IT THAT WE HAVE LENDERS THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY. AS I UNDERSTAND FROM THEM THIS HAVE -- IT WILL TO SERVE A VITAL SCORE SIX HUNDRED BELOW -- WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAINTAINING BUSINESS WISE OF THE YOUR BUSINESS ARE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT. IT IT REALLY IS ABOUT RISK. AND INTEREST RATE. OKAY. I'D LIKE TO SEE THE NUMBERS OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY SERVE BELOW. SIX HUNDRED FICUS SCORE OF IT SHOULD BE A VERY VERY SMALL NUMBER. THERE MAY BE OTHER REASONS WHY THEY DO IT [inaudible] BUT ANYTIME YOU HAVE A HIGH INTEREST RATE YOU HAVE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH IT WE UNDER RIGHT ALL OF OUR LOANS -- WHETHER IN ALL OF OUR TITLE LOANS UNSECURED LOANS SO IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T DO A GOOD JOB. AT UNDERWRITING. IT'S JUST A FACT OF LIFE THAT. WE ARE HIGHER RISK I TOLD YOU WHAT THE WHATTHE THE RATES -- ARE THE 20% -- DEFAULT. AND SO AS A CONSEQUENCE. YOUR IT'S A HIGHER RISK. AND THEREFORE THAT'S WHY IT COSTS MORE FOR US TO GET MONEY A TO BORROW MONEY TO LEND MONEY OUT. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO LEND MONEY OUT AHEAD. TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR CUSTOMER BASES I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MR GOVERNOR'S -- MEMBERS SERVICE OUR CUSTOMER BASE IN ANY GREAT PERCENTAGES I COULD BE WRONG. MAY I ACT WITH COMMONSENSE. I'D LIKE THAT [inaudible] BUT SO OBVIOUS THAT REPRESENT A TRADE ASSOCIATION CELL I LISTEN TO MY MEMBERS AND WHAT THEY CONVEY TO ME I ALSO KNOW. THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE PILOT PROGRAM WHAT THEY HAVE CONVEYED TO ME IT'S UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES. TO GIVE ME A SPECIFIC NUMBERS I'M NOT A POSITION TO DO THAT BUT AGAIN THEY HAVE ASSURED ME THEY TO ISSUE LOANS TO PEOPLE WITH ZERO FIVE THE SCORES. AND THEY DO ISSUE LOANS TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE HIGH INTEREST LOANS THE NUMBERS. AGAIN I'M I'M NOT A POSITION TO DO THAT CERTAINLY I CAN TALK TO THEM. AND REACH OUT TO THE COMPANIES AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD SHARE BUT I'M NOT A POSITION TO DO THAT. IF YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BUT HE PLEASE KEEP IT BRIEF. YEAH YES YES I'M JUST JUST ADDING I DID I DID REVIEW -- MISTER GOVERNOR'S -- LENDERS -- ONE MAIN REPORTS THAT THEIR AVERAGE I GO SIX THIRTY FIVE OPPORTUNE REPORTS THAT THE AVERAGE PSYCHO IS SIX THIRTY NINE MINUS -- SIX HUNDRED IN JUSTONE OTHER COMMENT ON THE MILITARY LANDING THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT 36% IS WORKING FOR THE MILITARY I WILL SHARE THAT THEIR SPOUSES COME INTO OUR STORES ALL THE TIME TRYING TO CONCEAL THEIR STATUS BECAUSE THEY NEED CREDIT. THANK YOU -- COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THAT MEMBERS I THINK WE'VE HEARD. A HEALTHY DISCUSSION FOR THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS ABOUT THIS ISSUE -- AND ANYTHING TO WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS A BILL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON TO FIND A COMPROMISE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. TO BOTH SIDES ARE MULTIPLE SIDES THINK WE COULD DO MORE -- AND AND CERTAINLY AT WHAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEEL IS AN IN BETWEEN OPTION -- THAT WILL KEEP UP BUSINESSES OFFERING THE PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT WILL NOT TOUCH ON OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PRODUCT OF A SORRY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SMALL DOLLAR LENDING PRODUCTS OUT THERE -- AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO SOME APPROPRIATIONS BATON SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS ALI MON HI LIMON HI CHEN. CHEN NO BEAR CAN'T HI THERE CAN I BURKE [inaudible] CERVANTES. CERVANTES AYE CHOI. NOW THE CHOI NO GABRIEL. CABLE AYE GRAYSON AYE GRAYSON AYE MELENDEZ. MULLIN THERE'S NO STONE WEBER. WEBER I WICKS. THEBILL WILL MAKE ALL THE SIX SIZE THREE KNOWS. WILL PLACE ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] ONE MINUTE HE DID. IT'S BEEN TWO DAYS I DON'T REMEMBER [inaudible] ONE MORE THE AS MADAM CHAIR AT SOMEONE AND Là M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; NOW.&lt;/c&gt;</u> SB SIX FORTY TWO PLEASE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SIX FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THOUSANDS OF CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHO ARE SERVED BY FINANCE LENDERS AND BROKERS LICENSE. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCE LAW UNDER EXISTING LINE DEFINITION OF BROKER AND IS IT'S VAGUE AND IT'S CIRCULAR LEADING TO CONFUSION FROM LENDERS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES CAN THEY CAN PARTNER WITH WHEN ARRANGING LOANS RUMORED BILL. WE HAVE A MOVING TO SECOND. AND I WILL SAY THAT TO KEEP IT SHORT I WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH LENDERS ONLY GENERATORS ARE FOR THE LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL APPROPRIATELY JUST AS THE CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNED IN OUR LENDING MARKETS. WITHOUT PLACING UNNECESSARY BURDENS ON THE BUSINESSES -- THAT WORKED IN THAT AREA -- AND I DO HAVE TO SEND MORE INTEL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TESTIFYING. GREAT I CHAIR VICE TURN MEMBERS HIS AND MARTIN DEALS IN YOUR POLICY COUNCIL WITH CONSUMER REPORTS FORMALLY CONSUMERS UNION. STRONG SUPPORT THE BILL OF WORKED WITH THE CHAIR FOR THE LAST YEAR ON IT. IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK THE A LOT OF CONSUMERS GOING ONLINE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT WHEN THEY CLICK ON AN AD IT'S A LEAD GENERATOR NOT THE LENDER THEY MAY NOT KNOW THE BADLY GENERATORS BEING COMPENSATED. OR HOW THEY'RE HANDLING THEIR SENSE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION SO THIS IS A VERY. STRAIGHTFORWARD AND COMMON SENSE. MEASURE TO UPDATE -- AND ENSURE THAT OUR CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS KEEP UP WITH THE PACE OF TECHNOLOGY. AND I REALLY APPLAUD THE CHAIRS -- HARD LOOK THIS YEAR AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE STATE FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT IN THIS I SEE IS A CORE COMPONENT OF THAT STRATEGY FOR THE OR SO AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I REQUEST MY THAT. WHEN THIS IS A IN SUPPORT? GOOD AFTERNOON DANIEL CANDOR BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION IN SUPPORT. CHRISTMAS OUR ON BEHALF OF ON DECK CAPITAL IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MIKE BONTA GONNA BE HAVE THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO TREASURER'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. WELL IN WHAT IS IN OPPOSITION. NOT SEEN ON HOPES USER. PARDON -- ACTUALLY WE'RE SUPPORT IF AMENDED -- IS IT OKAY IF WE PROCEED. SUPPORT OF AN OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SORRY FOR THE CONFUSION HI DAVID CANTON ON BEHALF OF THE ALL NIGHT LENDERS ALLIANCE AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE THANKFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. IT'S BEEN A MULTI YEAR PROCESS AND WE THINK WE'RE GETTING TO A VERY VERY CLOSE PLACE IN A LITTLE STREET THAT IN ONE IN ONE SECOND HERE -- WE'RE SUPPORTERS OF SUPPORTIVE OF LIFE LICENSING IN GENERAL THE ONLY ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER LICENSING OF LEAD GENERATING THAT WE DO WE DON'T. DISRUPT THE CUSTOMER'S EXPERIENCE SO MUCH THAT THEY MIGRATE AWAY FROM FROM THE FROM THE EXPERIENCE IN MOVE TO NON COMPLIANT LEAD GENERATORS WHICH WILL LEAD THEM TO PREDATORY SITES. THAT'S OUR CONCERN SO AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK HERE'S WHERE WE ARE WE HAVE THREE ISSUES THAT WE WOULD LIKE FOR THE AUTHOR TO PLEASE TO TO TO LOOK AT AND AND I THINK IF WE CAN TAKE CARE THESE WE WOULD BE THERE ON THE BILL. WITH YOU ONE OUR DISCLOSURES IN CONSENT -- OVER HALF OF OUR CUSTOMERS NOW COME BY WAY OF CELL PHONE AND IF YOU KNOW BY YOU KNOW CELL PHONE USE VERY QUICK ACTING -- BY REQUIRING THEM TO DO WE DISCLOSE IN CONSENT MANY MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WITH THE DO THE TO SAY FORGET IT I'M GONE. I'M TO GO TO A NON COMPLIANT LEAD GENERATOR HE'S GOING TO SEND ME SOME MONEY. SO IF WE COULD GET A ONE AREA FOR DISCLOSURE IN CONSENT I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE OUR OUR POSITION MUCH MUCH BETTER. SECONDLY OR THE TEN POINT FONT RIGHT NOW THE BILL HAS A VERY PRESCRIPTIVE TEN POINT POINT FONT -- REQUIREMENT AGAIN WITH WITH MOBILE DEVICES THAT JUST REALLY DOESN'T TRANSLATE TO THE EXPERIENCE FOR THE CONSUMER SO WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME SORT OF ON ME MIDDLE GROUND WHERE WE CAN GET A LARGER FONT ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE. INSTANCES WHERE THE CONSUMERS USING A MOLD MOBILE DEVICE AND FINALLY -- THE ISSUE OF AMNESTY WE HAVE MANY VERY GOOD LEE GENERATORS WHO ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA WHO WANT TO BE COMPLIANT. BUT WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT ONCE THE BILL PASSES IN IF DOES PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW. THAT THEY AREN'T CUT OUT BECAUSE THEY WERE ON ACTING AS A LEAD GENERATOR SO WE WOULD LIKE SOME SORT OF AMNESTY PROVISION IN THERE SO THAT COMPLAIN LEE GENERATORS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO ANYWAY IF WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR I THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE BILL. THANK YOU -- OTHER WITNESSES ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. MELANIE GRIFFITH WITH CAN TANA WATSON HEARD MEN ON BEHALF OF THE UP REALLY TRIED AGAIN IN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION -- THIS REFLECTS OUR NEED TO CODIFY TROUBLE SEVENTY IN THE BILL AS WELL AS CLARIFYING THAT A LEGITIMATE TRAVEL ANY BUSINESS CAN CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS WITH A CALIFORNIA LICENSE FEE. THANKS. ALEX FELONIES ON BEHALF OF THE US SMALL BUSINESS FINANCE CESSATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED WE JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE COMMERCIAL LENDING TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL -- COMMERCIAL LENDERS ARE GOING TO THE PROCESS OF THE PASSAGE OF SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE FROM LAST YEAR. THEY'RE GOING TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND DPO AND SO. PART OF THAT PROCESS WILL BE THE ADOPTION OF A COMPREHENSIVE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. AND SO WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE COUPLE DISCLOSURE STATEMENTS ONE PASSED BY THROUGH THIS LONG THAT ONE THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS SO BUT WE LOOK FOR TO HAVE A CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR. AND THE STAFF IF WE CAN MEET UP SOME FOR THE MIDDLE GROUND MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU UP QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. XENON MADAM CHAIR WAS LIKE TO CLOSE.
