THAT'S ON THE COMMITTEE SINCE UP PRIVACY'S COMING AT ONE THIRTY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF BILLS WE WILL START. AT THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND MELENDEZ WANT TO COME AND TESTIFY WE DO HAVE -- FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HERE. SO WE DO HAVE MEMBERS THEY'RE HERE. TO THAT YEAH TO SEE. MISS MELENDEZ AB. TEN NINETY SIX ITEM NUMBER. FIFTEEN GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I HAVE A BILL YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE. THIS IS THE BEST BILL IN THE MORNING THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING FIRST OKAY. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN A CONCEALED CARRY WEAPON PERMIT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED EQUALLY NOR FAIRLY THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. CURRENTLY COUNTY SHERIFF'S OR CITY POLICE CHIEFS HAVE FREE RANGE TO ISSUE CC W'S ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS EVEN AFTER AN INDIVIDUAL HAS PASSED THE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND MEET ALL OF THE APPROPRIATE REQUIREMENTS. EXISTING CODE LEAVES GOOD CAUSE AND GOOD MORAL CHARACTER I NEED TO FIND. MORE THAN FORTY STATES INCLUDING WASHINGTON AND OREGON HAVE MOVED TO A SHALL ISSUE PROCESS WHEN ISSUING CCW TO CITIZENS WHO PASSED THE STRICT BACKGROUND CHECK IN MEDIA PERVERT REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY IN CALIFORNIA CITIZENS SEEKING TO APPLY FOR CCW FACED UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WHICH IS ALREADY LONG AND EXPENSIVE. AND FURTHERMORE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BUT REGULARLY COMMUTE HERE FOR FAMILY TRAVELS ARE FOR BUSINESS. THERE ARE BARRED FROM MEETING APPLYING FROM APARTMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIVE IN THE STATE. THE A MISSION A DEFINING GOOD CLAUSE IN THE PENAL CODE HAS RESULTED IN THE UNEQUAL APPLICATION OF THE LAW ARE IN DENIAL ARBITRARY DENIAL BY THE WAY OF CCW PERMITS TO CALIFORNIANS. IN FACT DEPENDING ON THE COUNTY IN WHICH ONE RESIDES IN INDIVIDUAL COULD BE DENIED THEIR REQUEST FOR CCW DESPITE PASSING ALL THE REQUIREMENTS DESPITE PASSING THE BACKGROUND CHECKS SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT PARTICULARLY. PARTICULAR ISSUING OFFICIAL. DOESN'T LIKE TO ISSUE THEM. THIS BILL AB TEN NINETY SIX MAKES CALIFORNIA SHALL ISSUE STATE AND DEFINES THE TERM GOOD BECAUSE IN THE PENAL CODE IN ORDER TO MAKE CLEAR THE REQUIREMENTS. FOR CCW PERMIT APPLICANTS GOOD BECAUSE WILL INCLUDE SELF DEFENSE DEFENDING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER OR PREVENTING CRIME IN WHICH HUMAN LIFE IS THREATENED. BY FURTHER CLARIFYING GOOD BECAUSE THIS BILL WILL MAKE ISSUING C. C. W.'S UNIFORM AND MUCH EASIER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME TO WITNESSES TODAY BILL YOUNG WHO IS THE PRESIDENT OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND NIKKI STALLARD WHO IS A MEMBER OF THE PINK PISTOLS WHICH IS A GAY GUN RIGHTS. ORGANIZATION AND I WILL -- ASKING MALT LADIES FIRST NIKKI WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO FIRST SURE ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND I JUST REALLY HAVE A FEW WORDS HERE TO SAY. SELF DEFENSE IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILLS ABOUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW. THE SUPREME COURT. IN HELLER DID RULE IN FACT THAT SELF DEFENSE IS THE CORE OF THIS OF THE SECOND MA'AM TO CORE RIGHT. AND THE SUPREME COURT RULED IN TWO THOUSAND WELL AS ACTUALLY BAKARE RULING FROM A MASSACHUSETTS CASE ITANO VERSES MASSACHUSETTS FOR MASSACHUSETTS CONVICTED A HOMELESS WOMAN. OF CARRYING AN ELECTRIC STUN GUN BECAUSE THEY CLAIM TO WASN'T COVERED BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE THE US SUPREME COURT WHY THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE CASE EIGHT TWO ZERO THEY VACATED. SO WHAT DOES THIS SAY SELF DEFENSE DOES APPLY OUTSIDE THE HOME AND THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS OUTSIDE THE HOME THEY IMPLY. DOES APPLY. YES THERE'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY I SHALL ISSUES CCW SYSTEM DOES BALANCE BUT IT MUST BE EQUAL UNDER THE LAW ARTICLE ONE SECTION SEVEN BE OF OUR STATE CONSTITUTION SAYS GNOSIS INNER CLASSICISTS INS. SHALL BE GRANTED A PRIVILEGE AND IMMUNITY THAT'S NOT DONE EQUAL BASIS. EQUAL ACROSS THE BOARD. NOW REALIZE THAT THE SHALL ISSUE HAVE WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY THREE AT A TIME WHEN AMERICA WAS A VERY RACES COUNTRY AND THE LAW HAD A RACES INTENT. THIS MODEST REFORMER CALIFORNIA LAW WILL BRING OUR CURRENT SHE SHE W. LAWS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE QUALITY OF THE LAW. EQUALITY IN THE LAW DOESN'T SAY EQUAL FOR SOME RIGHTS IT'S EQUAL FOR ALL RIGHTS AND OUR RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE WITH OUR WRITER SELF DEFENSE. ALL RIGHT IS ILLUSIONARY. I CHOOSE NOT TO LIVE MY LIFE IN FEAR BUT I'M A REALIST I'M IN THE WORST DEMOGRAPHIC MANY MY MEMBERS ARE IN THE WORST DEMOGRAPHICS OF BEING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE MAY TIMES FACING MULTIPLE ATTACKERS. HAND GUNS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PERSONAL SELF DEFENSE TOOL IF AN INDIVIDUAL PASSES A PASS BACKGROUND CHECKS TAKES APPROPRIATE TRAINING. CCW SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE A REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN. INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS AND PUBLIC SAFETY CCW HOLDERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVERALL OR THE MOST LAW BUYING DEMOGRAPHIC. YES THERE'S A FEW OUT LIARS BUT HOLDING. I JYJ PORTION OF THE POPULATION STRIPPING THEM OF THEIR FOOD RIGHT TO SELF DEFENSE FOR THE ACTIONS OF FEW IS SOMETHING. THAT ONLY IN AUTHORITARIAN FASCIST WOULD DO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND JUST HOPE FOR ME THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM.

IT IS WITH GREAT HONOR TO BE HERE TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE FOUR THOUSAND PLUS MEMBERS OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AS THEIR PRESIDENT. WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT. FOR A MAGNITUDE REASONS ONE OF THEM IS IT ENHANCES THE PUBLIC SAFETY OUT THERE IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE EVERYWHERE. AND WHAT I FOUND IN MY SEVENTEEN YEARS AS BEING A POLICE OFFICER. I FOUND THAT I'VE GONE TO CRIMES WHERE PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE SAVED AND AND CRIMES WERE PREVENTED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE LAWFULLY CARRYING A CCW. MYSELF AND SEVERAL OF MY PARTNERS A TOWN ALMOST ALL MY PARTNERS OF FOUND THAT. CCW HOLDERS ARE AMONGST THE MOST LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUT THERE. AND THEY FOLLOW THE LAW. THE PROBLEM THAT WE RUN INTO WHEN IT'S A GOOD CAUSES ALLOWS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL USE IT AS A BARGAINING CHIP FOR PEOPLE TO DONATE WHICH WE FOUND OUT AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY THIS LAST ELECTION CYCLE. AND IT TAKES AWAY PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN DANGER ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE FROM COUNTIES THAT ARE. RULE IN NATURE AND HAVE LONG DISTANCES TO TRAVEL. FOR CITIZEN TO BE ABLE. TO USE THEIR THEIR RIGHTS AFFORDED TO THEM AND BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEIR LIVES OTHER NEIGHBORS LIVES AND MAKES OUR JOBS -- THAT MUCH EASIER. SO WE JUST WANT TO COME IN AND SHOW OUR SUPPORT. IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SHALL ISSUE -- AS OPPOSED TO A GOOD COSTS. OKAY THANK YOU NOT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN READ WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR GUN OWNERS A CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION.

THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. OKAY -- ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT [inaudible] OKAY. SEVEN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. WHO IS ADVOCATE NOT BE HERE RIGHT NOW IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. FOR IF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. CHARLES HARVEY WITH THE LEGAL CALIFORNIA CITIES -- OUR BOARD HAS YET TO TAKE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT IN SENDING IT THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS -- WE HAVE MEMBERS AT A VERY STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT REMOVING THE DISCRETION OF A MUNICIPAL POLICE CHIEFS TO TO ISSUE THESE -- CCW PERMITS -- BUT UNTIL THEN -- WE DO NOT OFFICIAL POSITION AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU MISTER HARVEY. WHO USED TO WORK IN MY OFFICE? NOW HAS MORE POWER MORE MONEY SO THAT'S GOOD DAY. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MR LACKEY. YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE PARTICULAR WHAT MR SHE TALKED ABOUT -- HE INDICATED THAT DEMOGRAPHIC -- AND I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A ARE YOU REFERRING TO LGBT Q.. YES OKAY SO IF I COULD ASK YOU. WHAT DOES NOT MEAN ABLE TO CARRY CONCEALED -- WEAPON UNIQUELY HOW HOW DOES IT UNIQUELY IMPACT THAT COMMUNITY OR THAT DEMOGRAPHIC YOU REFER. TO OR DOES IT. WELL. IT'S A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THAT WE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGHER. NO VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIME OFTEN INVOLVING MULTIPLE OFFENDERS BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PASSED HATE CRIME LEGISLATION THERE'S A NOTE. AIDS IRREFUTABLE THAT WE HAVE ISSUES THAT WHEN YOU'RE FACING MULTIPLE ATTACKERS WHEN CRITICAL SECONDS COUNT. YOU DON'T SB DIALING YOUR PHONE WILL WORK THINGS LIKE MASON PEPPER SPRAY WILL NOT DETER VIOLENT ATTACKERS SPECIALLY IF THEY'RE ARMED WITH CLUBS OR KNIVES OR WHATEVER. AND THE VICTIMS OF HATE CRIME ATTACKS. MANY ARE. WHILE MANY DON'T GET KILLED MAYOR SERIOUSLY INJURED THEY HAVE PHYSICAL INJURIES AND YOU HAVE SCARS BECAUSE YOU'RE WALKING DOWN AND YOU'RE JUST. DOING YOUR OWN THING AND MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND YOU JUST GET. BAM YOU GET ATTACKED AND IT'S A FIREARM G. AT WILL IT GIVES YOU A FIGHTING CHANCE OF YOUR FACING TWO THREE OR MORE ATTACKERS A FIREARM. IS A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT BECAUSE WE FACING THAT MANY TYPE ATTACKS THAT TYPE OF ATTACK. YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER YOU ARE AT HIGH RISK OF GREAT BODILY HARM. AND A FIRE A FIREARM IS A AS THE LATE ANTONE SCALIA SAID IT IS THE QUINTESSENTIAL SELF DEFENSE TOOL. WE JUST WANT EQUALITY ALONG WITH WE JUST WE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR LIVES IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY A POLL TO SECOND AMENDMENT AND IT ALSO ENFORCES WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UNITED STATES DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW CALIFORNIANS MUST PASS A RIGOROUS BACKGROUND CHECK INCOMPLETE NUMEROUS HOURS OF SAFETY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS AND CAN STILL BE DENIED A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE OR WHERE THEY LIVE FURTHERMORE IF THE DOJ IS DOING THEIR JOB AND TAKING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS THE DENIAL CCW SHOULD NOT BE A CONCERN. SHARES CAN DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE HAS GOOD CAUSE TO RECEIVE A CCW PERMIT BUT THE INTERPRETATION OF GOOD CAUSE HAS BEEN INCONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACROSS OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ISSUED SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR PERMITS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LOS ANGELES COUNTY ISSUED FOUR HUNDRED NINETY FOUR IN SAN FRANCISCO ISSUED. FOR AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE MISTER CHAIR LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS TEN TIMES THE SIZE OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND FOUR TIMES THE SIZE OF SAN FRANCISCO. AB TEN NINETY SIX GUARANTEES THAT IF A CITIZEN PASSES THE STRINGENT BACKGROUND CHECK COMPLETES THE NECESSARY FIREARM SAFETY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS IN IS DEEMED TO HAVE GOOD CAUSING GOOD MORAL CHARACTER. THE SHALL BE ISSUED A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. EVERY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN NO MATTER THEIR RACE RELIGION SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR POLITICAL PARTY AFFILIATION HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. THIS BILL WILL REVISE A GOOD CAUSE SHARES PROVISION OF CURRENT LAW TO INCLUDE THE NEED FOR SELF DEFENSE DEFENDING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER. OR PREVENTING CRIME IN WHICH HUMAN LIFE IS THREATENED AND ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO GREAT INDIVIDUALS LIVING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THE ABILITY APPLY FOR CCW PERMIT UNDER SHERIFF'S DISCRETION THERE IS NO REASON TO DENY SOMEONE. THIS TYPE OF PERMIT SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR BECAUSE YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE GUNS IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE IN DURING HARM OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T DEFEND THEMSELVES IF THEY'VE PROVEN THEMSELVES IF THEY HAVE MET THE CONDITIONS A THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE TRAINING IF THEY PAID THEIR MONEY. THE IT SHOULD BE A SHALL ISSUE STATE WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I ABOUT. THANK YOU -- I KNOW WE WE'VE TRAVELED THIS ROAD BEFORE -- MANY TIMES MANY TIMES -- AND IT. AND UNTIL OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE -- SHOWS THAT. AND I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH EITHER THE SHERIFF'S OR ARE YOU WITNESSED AT THAT THERE MAY BE FLAWS IN IT BUT THERE'S ONE THING WE DO KNOW -- THE EXISTING SYSTEM HAS HAD AN UNBELIEVABLE SUCCESS RATE AS FAR AS MAKING SURE KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THE WRONG PEOPLE. AND AS WE ALL KNOW WE CAN'T SAY THAT A LOT ABOUT A LOT OF LEGISLATION THAT WE DO AND WE SPECIALLY CAN'T SAY THAT ABOUT A LOT OF PUBLIC SAFETY. LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE AND UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO SAY NO REALLY BASED ON SUCCESS OF THE EXISTING CALIFORNIA CCW REGULATION. THERE MAY BE GOOD REASONS WHY EACH ONE OUTSIDE OF POLITICAL. AND MAYBE. SOME PREJUDICES TOWARDS CERTAIN GROUP -- THERE MAY BE SOME VERY GOOD REASONS THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHY SACRAMENTO MAY GIVE OUT MORE SO THAN LA OR OTHER PLACES OR SAN FRANCISCO. BUT I'D SOMEONE AB POLITICS BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- DAVID VERY GOOD AT MAKING SURE THAT -- THE EXISTING CCW SYSTEM HAS BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL SO WITH THAT UNFORTUNATE HAVE TO RECOMMEND AN OVER [inaudible] ISABEL. ON AB TEN NINETY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN YOU THERE K. HAD NO DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NO QUIRK. QUIRK NOW SANTIAGO WICKS NO WEEKS NOW. I'M SORRY THE MEASURE FAILS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT -- ITEM NUMBER TEN AB TEN SIXTY FOUR MORE OUT SU CHI HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR NOW. TO MR FONT -- BILL NUMBER -- FIVE SIX NINE ITEM NUMBER. TWO WHAT EVERY YEAR REDDING MISBACH BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. AB FIVE SIX NINE ADDRESS IS A GROWING PROBLEM OF INDIVIDUALS KNOWINGLY REPORTING A FALSE ACTIVE SHOOTER UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT IS A CRIMES REPORT THAT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY KNOWING THAT THE REPORT IS FAKE WHAT IS COMMONLY KNOWN AS SWATTING IS WHEN INDIVIDUAL KNOWINGLY REPORTS AN EMERGENCY WITH THE INTENTION OF DRAWING HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE OR SWAP. ACCORDING TO FBI ESTIMATES THERE'S ROUGHLY AROUND FOUR HUNDRED SWATTING CASES THAT OCCUR ANNUALLY NATIONWIDE. THESE INSTANCES UNFORTUNATELY HIT CLOSE TO HOME. THIS PAST YEAR TWO SEPARATE FALSE ACTIVITY REPORTS OCCURRED AT HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT. KERN COUNTY A BIGGER SO LAW% ENFORCEMENT RESPONDED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND CLEARED BOTH REPORTS THEY WORKED ALONGSIDE HOSPITAL PERSONNEL TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. ONE OF THE HOSPITAL PATIENTS WERE INJURED OR HURT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE DRAIN ON VERY LIMITED LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. BUT IT ALSO PUT PATIENTS AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN A VERY DRAMATIC SITUATIONS. THESE FALSE INCIDENCES REQUIRING HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE. OR VITAL EMERGENCY RESOURCES AWAY FROM OTHER POSSIBLE EMERGENCIES. THIS BILL CREATES GREATER DETERRENCE FOR INDIVIDUAL TO FALSELY REPORT ACTIVE SHOOTER REPORTING FALSE EMERGENCIES ESPECIALLY THOSE INVOLVING AN ACTIVE SHOOTER. MUST BE TREATED WITH THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS THE SERIOUSNESS. THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPICE ASSOCIATION AND VARIOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT IS THAT THE IS AMERICAN CAGES RETURNEE AND BRUCE PETERS PRESIDENT AND CEO OF BOTH DOWNTOWN AND SOUTHWEST MERCY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN THE MORNING AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- MY NAME IS CINDY ZIMMER AND I'M KERN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES THAT WE HAVE HAD IN KERN COUNTY. AND TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORTIVE AB. FIVE SIX NINE IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN A MAN CAME TO BAKERSFIELD HEART HOSPITAL. WITH A RIFLE AND FIRED FIVE SHOTS INTO THE GLASS DOORS OF THE BUILDING NGUYEN INSIDE. AND TERRORIZE -- SOME OF THE PEOPLE INSIDE AND IT COST FEAR NOT ONLY IN THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO FEAR IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. JUST A FEW MONTHS LATER IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN I WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS LATER THERE WAS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER CALL. A RECEIPT BY THE BAKERSFIELD MERCY HOSPITAL. ALL AVAILABLE OFFICERS LEFT WHAT THEY WERE DOING WENT THERE RUSHED TO THEIR TO THE SCENE. AND SPENT FOUR HOURS TRYING TO CLEAR THE HOSPITAL DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENED AND THEY DETERMINED IT WAS A HOAX AND THE CALL CAME FROM WAS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL. LESS THAN SIX MONTHS LATER FOUR MONTHS LATER. IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WAS ANOTHER REPORT OF AN ACTIVE SHOOTER THIS TIME. AT BAKERSFIELD MERCY -- SKEWS ME MEMORIAL HOSPITAL A HUGE HOSPITAL AGAIN ALL AVAILABLE FIREFIGHTERS FIRST RESPONDERS PEACE OFFICERS. CONVERGED UPON THE HOSPITAL IT TOOK SIX HOURS. TO GO -- PLACE BY PLACE TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS TRULY IN AN ACTIVE SHOOTER -- AFTER THIS LONG INVESTIGATION IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PERSON WHO CALLED IN THE HOAX. WAS A PERSON THAT WAS ALSO IMPERSONATING A PEACE OFFICER INSIDE THE HOSPITAL. HE ADMITTED THAT HE WAS THE ONE THAT HAD CALLED IN THE HOAX. A SIX MONTHS BEFORE AND ALSO DONE ANOTHER ONE IN BETWEEN -- THESE INCIDENTS -- WHETHER A HOAX OR IS -- WHETHER OF OF REPORT OF A AN ACTIVE SHOOTER IS A HOAX A REAL THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS TO VICTIMS. OF PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY WHO WERE ON LOCKDOWN IT IT IS SEVERE WE TEACH IN OUR NATION FOR STUDENTS TO RUN AND HIDE AND FIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE ON EDGE. I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL -- THIS BILL WOULD MODERNIZE MODERNIZE OUR LOSS TO RECOGNIZE THAT INTENTIONAL NOT ACCIDENTAL BUT INTENTIONAL FALSE REPORTS OF ACTOR SHOOTERS SHOULD BE APPROPRIATELY PUNISHED. AND UNDER APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE PUNISHED AS FELONIES -- HANDLING THIS TYPE OF OFFENSE IS JUST TOO SERIOUS TO TREAT IT AS A MISDEMEANOR. THIS BILL WOULD MAKE THIS A WOBBLE -- NOT STATE PRISON AB ELIGIBLE BUT A WAFFLER. IT COULD BE A FELONY OR A MISDEMEANOR. AND IT WOULD GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE COURTS TO TAKE EACH OFFENDER ON A CASE BY CASE BE BASIS AND FASHION A SENTENCE. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THE DEFENDER OF THE OFFENDER A BE A DETERRENT AND PROTECT THE PUBLIC. WE WITH SOME FELONY TEETH CORD WITH A COMBINATION OF JAIL AND MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. DRUG TREATMENT. AND WITH THE ONE ON ONE PROBATION OFFICER HELP THIS OFFENDER SO THEY WOULDN'T DO IT AGAIN BECAUSE THIS OFFENDER -- THAT WE DID HAD IN THIS CASE DID THIS THREE TIMES. THREE TIMES SO I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND FOR LISTENING TO WHAT HAPPENED TO US DOWN IN KERN COUNTY. AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF A GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS BRUCE PETERS PRESIDENT CEO OF MERCY HOSPITALS AND BAKERSFIELD. ON BEHALF OF DIGNITY HEALTH ONE IS THIRTY TWO HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. FIVE SIXTY NINE THANK YOU MEMBER FONG FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. DIGNITY HEALTH'S MISSION IS TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY COMPASSIONATE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THAT INCLUDES. PROTECTING OUR PATIENTS STAFF AND VISITORS FROM HARM. WE HAVE SAFETY SECURITY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS IN PLACE TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE. AND WE TAKE SERIOUSLY OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO STEWARD WELL THE PRECIOUS HEALTH CARE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. AT A TIME WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE. AND HOSPITALS ARE DOING THEIR VERY BEST TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN TO EVERYONE IN NEED WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN TO DETER SWATTING. FROM OCCURRING AND COMMUNITIES. THE FALSE ACTIVE SHOOTER REPORTS THAT PLAYED OUT LAST YEAR TO OVER HOSPITALS WITHIN FOUR MONTHS TIME OF ONE ANOTHER A TESTAMENT TO WHY. IT IS A MIRACLE NO ONE DIED. PEOPLE WERE SHELTERED IN PLACE FOR HOURS. PREVENTED FROM MOVING TO OPERATING ROOMS OTHER PROCEDURAL AREAS AND EVEN PATIENT ROOMS. PHYSICIANS AND OTHER CRITICAL STAFF MEMBERS WERE PREVENTED FROM ENTERING THE HOSPITAL'S. TO DELIVER POTENTIALLY LIFE SAVING TREATMENT. SO THE THREAT TO THE LIVES OF OUR PATIENTS IS VERY REAL. BOTH END INCIDENTS TOOK A COMBINED NINE TO TEN HOURS UNTIL OUR HOSPITALS WERE CLEARED. THAT ALSO TRANSLATES TO THOUSANDS OF STAFF HOURS AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS CONSUMED. IMAGINE THE TRAUMA AND STRESS AND DOOR DURING THOSE DAYS AND WEEKS FOLLOWING. AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE REPUTATIONAL IMPACT HOSPITALS. PEOPLE MUST NOT FEEL AFRAID TO GO TO HOSPITALS TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT. THE TWO INCIDENTS TOOK SOMETHING FROM US AS A COMMUNITY. TIME THAT SENSE OF SECURITY AND COMMUNITY TRUST. AS WELL AS PRECIOUS RESOURCES THAT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE. BEEN DEPLOYED FOR THEIR TRUE INTENDED PURPOSES. FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON SB FIVE SIXTY NINE THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LARRY MORSE BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING LADIES GOOD MORNING. TWO ONE A COOPER SOCIALITE -- GOOD MORNING -- CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSES -- AB FIVE SIX NINE I'M MARGOT GEORGE -- AB FIVE SIX NINE IS UNNECESSARY THIS CONDUCT IS ALREADY PROHIBITED BY LAW ALL. OF THEIR VARIOUS SECTIONS OF ONE FORTY EIGHT POINT -- BAD EITHER PROHIBIT REPORTING OR CAUSING ANY REPORT TO ME MADE. THAT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION EXIST ON A SOME OF THE SECTIONS ARE ALREADY A ONE YEAR MISDEMEANOR. OTHER SECTIONS OF PROHIBIT FILING A POLICE REPORT FALSELY. ON ADDITIONALLY THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF AB. FIVE SIXTY NINE IS VAGUE AS SAYS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IS UNDER WAY. IT'S OVER BROAD AND THEN IT'S DEFINED TO MEAN IN -- REPORT OF GUNFIRE AND ANY POPULATED PLACE IN ANY REPORT OF A PERSON SHOOTING  FIRE ARM IN IN THE POPULATED PLACE WELL I LIVE IN OAKLAND. AND EVERY NEW YEAR'S EVE THERE ARE LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. ON SHOOTING FIRE ARMS OFF. AND WE'VE NOW HAD AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE FROM SAN FRANCISCO WE'RE NOT USED TO THAT. AND IF THEY REPORT THIS OF WHAT THEY'VE BEEN BE LIABLE FOR PROSECUTION BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING IT IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION BUT IN FACT IS ACTUALLY AN URBAN ANNOYANCE -- THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR THE COST OF THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE WITHOUT ANY PROVISION REGARDING TO ABILITY TO PAY MOST LIKELY UNCONSTITUTIONAL. UNDER TIM CITY INDIANA AND THEN THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL CASE PEOPLE V. TWAIN US. BECAUSE IT'S SIMPLY PUNISHES -- SOMEONE FOR BEING POOR. ADDITIONALLY -- WE FEEL THAT AB FIVE SIXTY NINE IS DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE CRIME THAT IT CREATES A FELONY AND I UNDERSTAND. HOW HORRIFYING IT MUST HAVE BEEN TO BE IN A HOSPITAL AND HAVE THE SITUATION -- ARISE BUT UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN -- AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PERSON WHO. COMMITTED THOSE OFFENSES WITH MENTALLY ILL. AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS KNOWS THINKING THAT USUALLY OR PERHAPS MORE CUSTOMARILY IS GONNA BE MINORS. WHO WERE CALLING IN THESE KIND OF CALLS WHO WERE ON WHO SEE AS SORT OF AS LIKE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY A TWELVE LEAD? OF PULLING THE FIRE OUR ALARM AT YOUR SCHOOL -- AB FIVE SIXTY NINE IS UNNECESSARY IT DUPLICATES EXISTING LAW IT VIOLATES THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT. ON FINES AND FEES AND WE ASKED FOR AN OF OF THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- I'VE WOULD JUST JOIN IN MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS -- AND ALSO NOTE THAT FELONY PENALTIES ARE ALREADY OF IT WILL FOR THIS -- BEHAVIOR WHEN -- WHEN THE FALSE REPORT RESULTS IN GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH -- AND THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT THE INCREASE IN PENALTY -- FOR THAT THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WILL HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DETERRENT EFFECT ON ON ON OF FALSE REPORTS OF ACTIVE SHOOTER -- SITUATIONS WE ASK FOR YOUR NOVA. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KIND OF CLARIFICATION. THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS USED ABOUT THE NEW YEAR'S EVE SHOOTING. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD. BE EVEN CLOSE TO AN EXAMPLE HERE BECAUSE THAT'S AN ACTUAL COURAGE WILL BE TAKING PLACE SO IT'S NOT A FALSE OCCURRENCE. WELL -- I'M SORRY [inaudible] SO. WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THIS IS HAPPENS EVERY NEW YEARS EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS THIS HAPPENS BUT HOW DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CHANNEL IT BECAUSE IT SAYS. ON AND IN A REPORT OF GUNFIRE AND ANY POPULATED PLACE. ANALYST'S REPORT OF BUT IT'S THE PEOPLE KNOW IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY I KNOW IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY MY NEIGHBORS NO IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY THEY JUST DON'T LIKE IT. SO THE CALLING UP NINE ONE ONE THE OAKLAND DISPATCHER AND SAYING. THERE'S AN ACTIVE SHOOTER HERE PEOPLE ARE FIRING GUN FIRE AND THEN HAVING THE POLICE RESPOND -- IS THE EMERGENCE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE CLEARLY DEBATABLE BUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS CLEARLY AN ACTUAL OCCURRENCE MAKES A COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM WHAT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. I I DON'T I DON'T THINK IT'S COMPLETELY AND AN ACCURATE -- ASSESSMENT JUST MY MY VIEW. RIGHT THANK YOU OR ANY OF COMMON TO THE STUDIO. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE FOR THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY -- MA'AM IT. IT WAS REYES THAT -- THIS BILL AB FIVE SIXTY NINE IS DO IS -- WE DONDON OR THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF DUPLICATE SEE AND HEAR WOULD WOULD YOU GIVE THE COMMITTEE. A FEW EXAMPLE OF HOW. OF WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS -- CURRENTLY DIFFERENT -- THAN WHAT WE HAVE ON THE BOOK. YES THIS WOULD MAKE IT A FELONY RATHER THAN A MISDEMEANOR AND THE SHOOTER IN OUR CASE -- IF TREATED AS A MISDEMEANOR OFFENDER WOULD HAVE HAD NO REAL -- SUPERVISION OR TEETH TO THE TO THE LAW ALL THIS PARTICULAR OFFENDER HAD SIX PRIOR FELONY CONVICTIONS WAS IN NOT A JUVENILE HE WAS FIFTY YEARS OLD. HOW TO RECORD GOING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE AND BY -- PROSECUTING HIM AS A MISDEMEANOR WHICH WOULD REALLY IT THE PUNISHMENT DID NOT FIT THE CRIME OR HIS RECORD NOW WE WOULD TAKE. EVERY INDIVIDUAL ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS IF IT WAS A YOUNG PERSON AND THAT KIND I THINK WE CAN HANDLE THE CASE IS A MISDEMEANOR. BUT THAT'S HOW IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT -- BUT WE WOULD HAVE A FELONY PROBATION OFFICER. OF SUPERVISING THE TREATMENT OF THIS INDIVIDUAL IF THEY HAD DRUG PROBLEMS IF THEY HAD MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OR IF THEY JUST LIKE TO COMMIT CRIMES IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE. THE FENDER PRETENDED HE WAS A POLICE OFFICER. AND WHEN THE POLICE CAME HE PRETENDED THAT HE WAS A POLICE OFFICER WAS TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE EVEN DETAINED PEOPLE SO SUCH A SERIOUS SERIOUS SITUATION. THAT -- MISDEMEANOR PUNISHMENT JUSTICE NOT FIT THE CRIME UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES [inaudible] PARKING. ISN'T IT A SEPARATE CRIME 10% OF POLICE OFFICERS WAS AND THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET A FELONY CONVICTION IN THIS CASE BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN TREATED AS A MISDEMEANOR. THAT IS HOW WE WERE ABLE BECAUSE OF THAT CRIME WERE ABLE TO DO THAT BUT NOT ALL. ACTIVE SHOOTERS PRETEND THEY'RE POLICE OFFICERS. RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO ELEVATE THE CRIME THAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING YOU'RE USING HIS IMPERSONATION OF A POLICE OFFICER WHICH IS A SEPARATE CRIME WHICH DOES RIGHTS A LEVEL OF FELONY SO. I DON'T THINK OVERLAPPING THIS THAT ON TOP OF THIS CRIME IS APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT THAT CRIME HAS THE APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENT BUT HE DIDN'T DO THAT IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE THREE HE ONLY DID THAT AND ONE OF THE FIRST TWO HE JUST CALLED IN A FALSE REPORT OF AN ACTIVE. SHOOTER WHICH SHUT DOWN THE HOSPITAL ITSELF AND HE WAS ABLE TO GAIN THE POLICE OFFICER INTELLIGENCE EACH TIME BY WATCHING. THE HOSPITAL BY MAKING THESE CALLS FROM INSIDE THE HOSPITAL ABOUT HOW OUR SWAT. TEAM ACTUALLY WORKS AND HOW THE TAKEN SO HE WAS ABLE TO BUILD ON THAT AND BY THE THIRD TIME HE THEN IMPERSONATED A PEACE OFFICER HIMSELF. AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR FONG AND RIGHT THERE ALREADY WE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES THEIR OTHER STATUTES THAT RATES THAT THERE IS THE DETERRENCE OF THOSE. WHAT ARE I'M SURE EXTREME COSTS IN THE CASE THAT ARE BEING DESCRIBED HERE FROM THE PERPETRATOR? SO CERTAINLY THERE IS THERE THERE ARE MEANS THE GETS THE CIVIL AND AND AND RECORD THE COST I THINK THE THE CRUX OF THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE. THAT IF THERE IS A HOAX OR A FALSE ACTIVE SHOOTER THAT THERE IS THE THE PROSECUTION ROPE THE TOOLS FOR THE PROSECUTION SIDE -- SO WHEN WE CAN WORK OUT THE THE REIMBURSEMENT SIDE BUT THE CRUX OF THE BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOMEHOW. THE ABILITY TO HAVE -- SOME FLEXIBILITY AND TO ENSURE THAT THAT PERSON IS A CAN BE TRIED UNDER FELONIES INSTEAD OF MISDEMEANORS. DOING ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE ALL THE SIMPLY SAY THAT THIS IS A GROWING AND TROUBLING TREND IN OUR SOCIETY IS VERY REAL THERE IS CERTAINLY AN IMPACT ON ALLOW FOR SOME RESOURCES. THAT CAN LEAD TO SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES TO THE PUBLIC -- WE CERTAINLY I DON'T WISH THIS TO HAPPEN TO ANY OF THE HOSPITALS IN YOUR DISTRICT BUT IT HAS HAPPENED TWICE A IN MINE AND SO WE SHOULD LEARN FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES -- WE HAD PATIENTS ALIVE IS PUT IN JEOPARDY WE HAVE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS AND OF COURSE IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO JUST HOSPITALS IT COULD APPLY TO ANY SITUATION ANY PUBLIC EVENTS. ANY -- AS SCENARIO WHERE -- THIS COULD BE -- SOMETHING THAT COULD BE COULD COULD OCCUR AGAIN SO I JUST SIMPLY ASK THAT WE LEARN FROM OUR EXPERIENCES AND AND ICE WAS BUT BASS WHEN I ABOUT. IN AYE. AND I THINK WE TALKED I REALLY TRY TO FIND SOME. SOME HAVE BEEN MEETING ACTON FORTUNE I COULD NAY MAY BEEN PARTLY THE TIME LIMIT AND A CHURCH RECOMMEND NO NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T. UNDERSTAND THE URGENCY BUT JUST THE COMPLEXITY OF ALL THE EVEN JUST DESCRIBING A DIFFERENT SITUATIONS -- IT BECAME DIFFICULT -- STE SO LET'S. TAKE. THEIR MOTION [inaudible] TO GET. ON EIGHTY FIVE SIXTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY I BAUER-KAHAN BAUER-KAHAN NO DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE.

THIS ROLE WHICH DOES PLAY AN IMPORTANT LIFE IS PEOPLE LEAVE LIVE TOGETHER. AND RAISE ASTANDARD IT'S SEVERAL BILL I DID A FEW YEARS AGO ON CODE FOR SOURCE -- YES. CODE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS COVER A BUILDING CODE IDEA THAT WAS RIGHT SO. I HAVE HIM RE BRZEZINSKI VERY BRIEFLY BECAUSE IT'S MOVED AND SECONDED TEN RIGHT. GOOD MORNING CHAIRED JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY MY NAME IS HENRY PERCENT SCAM THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL WELFARE ASSOCIATION LEGISLATIVE CHAIR. OF ALL FROM RECENT MERGER THE CALIFORNIA ANIMAL CONTROL DIRECTOR STATE HUMANE ASSOCIATION STATEWIDE GROUP. REPRESENT BOTH GOVERNMENT NONPROFIT AGENCIES -- THIS BILL WAS -- SOMEONE COOLEY STATED WAS PATTERNED AFTER CODE ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT. THERE'S A NEED TO INCREASE THE PROFESSIONALISM OF ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS LONG OVERDUE A WORD I HATE TO USE BUT THE DOG CATCHER DAYS. ARE LONG GONE THAT'S A DIRTY WORD IN MY BOOK. AS AS IS POUND -- OUR ANIMAL CONTROL OF THE STATEWIDE INVESTIGATING MULTITUDE OF ANIMAL CONTROL ORDINANCE VIOLATIONS AND CRIMES ALONG SIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE INVESTIGATE ANIMAL FIGHTING RINGS PREPARE AND EXECUTE SEARCH WARRANTS FOR ANIMAL ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND SEES DANGEROUS DOGS AS WELL AS ISSUE CITATIONS. THIS TRAINING WILL ALSO PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND LIMIT COVERED GOVERNMENT LIABILITY. SOME OF YOU MAY REMEMBER NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTH TWENTY TWELVE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY ANIMAL CONTROL SIR ROY MARKHAM WAS SHOT AND KILLED ONE ON THE LINE OF DUTY. BY A HOARDER. HOPEFULLY THIS TRAINING WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS UNFORTUNATE ACT -- THERE'S MERGING ANIMAL CARE TECHNIQUES PROPER LEGAL PROCEDURES WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO TRAINING. AND I'M SURPRISED TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WORKED IN THE EAST COAST FLORIDA HAD AS SUCH LEGISLATION AN ACTUAL LAW. SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLIES BILL TO SYSTEM RAISING THE BAR OF OUR NON DOG CATCHERS THANKS SO MUCH THANK YOU AGO. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR THE REASONS THAT I'VE ALREADY BEEN ARTICULATED IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES A SUPPORT. ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION HELLO. EARLY FOR TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE TRAINING DIRECTLY TO THE MIGHT MAYBE IT'LL CLOSER RIGHT THIS WILL SHOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE HERE -- FOR TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE TRADING BILL AND INTERESTED IN [inaudible] HOWEVER. I BELIEVE THAT AS A PROPOSED AB ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE IS SEVERELY FLAWED. FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. IT SHIFTS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF TRAINING TO THE FROM THE AGENCY TO THE EMPLOYEE. ON THIS BILL DOES NOT PROVIDE TRAINING OF NOR DOES IT PROVIDE INCENTIVES. TO THE EMPLOYER TO PAY FOR THE TRAINING. THE BILL ONLY HELPS TO EMPLOY THEIR EMPLOYER WHEN. FORCING THE EMPLOYEE TO PAY FOR THE TRAINING OUT OF THEIR POCKET. TAKE THEIR OWN TIME MISS WORK DOES NOT -- BENEFIT THE EMPLOYEE ONLY THAT THE EMPLOYER BECAUSE ONLY THE COMPANY OF THE TRAINING BILLS IS. FOR A CAL ANIMAL. ACTOR AND HAS IS PART OF THE ROUTE OPPOSITION THERE -- THERE WAS THREE OTHER BILLS FOR TRAINING -- SB -- TWELVE SEVENTY EIGHT AB TWO SEVENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY THREE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CáC. TO OPPOSED OUR BILL. OR THE BILLS THAT WERE OUT AND UNFORTUNATELY NOW THEY'RE PART OF CAL ANIMAL WHICH IS MERGED AND THAT THERE. THIS IS -- A ONE SIDED DEAL. THEY'RE GOING TO BE GETTING OF TELLING THE EMPLOYER WHERE YOU HAVE THE TRAINING AND STUFF POST IS NOT OFFER. ANIMAL CONTROL TRAINING THEY ONLY OFFER IT FOR A LONG FOR SMITH AND BY THE WAY. ROY MARKHAM WAS MY SON. I AM AS A MOTHER. AND THAT'S FOR ONE REASON WHY -- OPPOSING THIS BILL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT GIVE THE EMPLOYEE. THE OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING THEIR TRAINING PAID FOR AS IT SHOULD BE ARE YOU HI. AT A RESTAURANT TODAY I ASKED THE LADY. WHO THAT WAS SERVING US DO YOU HAVE TRAINING FOR YOUR JOB YEAH SHE HAS TRAINING FOR HER JOB WHERE IN THE JOB ALLOWS IT TH THE EMPLOYER PAYS FOR IT? SHE HAS AT LEAST ONE TRAINING OUT OF A YEAR. IF IT REQUIRES MORE TRAINING AND SHE GETS IT. AND THE EMPLOYER TRAINS IT IT BENEFITS THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE AND IT DOES NOT COME OUT OF HER POCKET. IF MY SON HAD TO PAY FOR THIS TRAINING HE HAD A FAMILY HE COULDN'T AFFORD IT. THEREFORE IF HE HAD THE MONEY TO PAY FOR A BULLET PROOF VEST HE WOULD HAVE DONE IT. AFTER HIS DEATH BULLET PROOF VESTS WERE PROVIDED. AND THAT WAS A HINDSIGHT. AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL IF IT WAS WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT I WOULD OF ALL WHOLEHEARTEDLY APPROVE IT. BECAUSE I SEE THIS BEYOND A CHAIN EFFECT. OF ITS EMPLOYEES HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR OWN TRAINING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. OFFICERS OUT THERE DOING. WHAT THEY SHOULD BE? DOING SOMETHING ELSE YOU'RE TO HAVE AN OFFICER OUT THERE DOING ANIMAL CONTROL TRAINING. IN PROVIDING FOR ANIMAL CONTROL. AT WHICH SOME OFFICERS DO BUT THE THING OF IT IS YOU CAN HAVE MORE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE AN ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICE THAT DOES A SEALS ONLY. THEY'RE GOING TO BE QUITTING THEIR JOBS ARE GOING TO GO INTO MORE ELSE OR SOMEBODY ELSE CAN PROVIDE YOUR TRAINING WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE IT BENEFITS THE AGENCY. NOT THE EMPLOYEE THANK YOU MA'AM. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE IF YOU WANT NAME ORGANIZATION OR JUST ONE MINUTE WHATEVER YOU WANT I MEMBERS SHALL I AM AND OPPOSITION OF THE BILL SIMPLY I AGREE FOR THE TRAINING. BUT I BELIEVE IT NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN DIFFERENTLY HONESTLY -- CALIFORNIA AND ANIMALS IS -- JOINED TOGETHER BY A CAPTAIN JACK THEY'VE COME TOGETHER -- AB ONE ELEVEN TWELVE IS UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICES PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ONLY PERSON THAT WOULD BE PROVIDING THE TRAINING FOR THE ACO IS WOULD BE KELL ANIMALS THERE ARE VERY FEW LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. COLLEGES THE COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED COURSES SO THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE. THE OPTION TO GO THROUGH CAL ANIMALS -- THAT'S A MONOPOLY RIGHT THERE IF YOU'RE FORCED TO PAY OUT OF POCKET AND TAKE YOUR OWN TIME TO GO DO THE TRAINING FOR YOUR JOB. WE ONLY HAVE ONE PLACE TO GO -- TO THAT'S NOT FAIR. AND THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS WHO ENFORCE LOCAL ORDINANCES AND STATE LAWS AND THE HUMANE OFFICERS TO ENFORCE ONLY SPECIFIC STATE LAWS. BUT CALIFORNIA ANIMALS WANTS TO DO A STANDARDIZED TRAINING AND IT DOES NOT FIT -- IN SIMPLE TERMS BOTH HUMANE OFFICERS AN ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS AND FOR STATE LAWS THAT PROTECT ANIMALS FROM HARM BY PEOPLE BUT HUMANE OFFICERS DO NOT ENFORCE STATE OR LOCAL ANIMAL CONTROL ORDINANCES. AND SECONDLY ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS AND FOR STATE AND LOCAL LAWS THAT PROTECT PEOPLE AND PETS AND ANIMALS FROM HARM BY ANIMALS. THE TWENTY TO FORTY OUR INITIAL TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICERS ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF A HUMANE OFFICERS BUT HAVE A LITTLE TO DO WITH THE ACO IS WORK YOU [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] AT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BAUER-KAHAN MR COOLEY WE ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET THERE'S ONLY ONE PROVIDER WHICH COULD BE CONCERNING. NOT BE DELIGHTED TO SPEAK BRIEFLY TO THAT -- I THINK THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY SET STANDARDS FOR THIS [inaudible] FIELD. AS YOU DO THAT OTHERS WILL FIND WAYS TO PROVIDE TRAINING I THINK IT IS. THIS BILL CHANGES THE ENVIRONMENT WAS TRAINING WILL HAPPEN -- THIS TYPE OF BILL ACTUALLY RAISES THE BAR ON THE UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEY HAVE A PROFESSIONAL OPERATION THEY'RE HARM PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KIND OF MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION OF RAISING YOUR OWN INTERNAL STANDARDS. SO THIS THIS APPROACH WHERE YOU TAKE A WELL RECOGNIZED. TYPE OF SERVICE PROVIDED THE LOCAL OVER GOVERNMENT. RECOGNIZE STANDARDS. FOR AND CREATE A A PROFESSIONALIZATION TRACK WILL START WORKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE UNITS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO THAT THEY THEY WANT TO TRAIN PEOPLE THEIR CONSTITUENTS WILL WANT TO TRAIN. THEY WILL. YEAH I CAME OUT OF THE CITY I WAS A FOUNDER OF A CITY I WAS A LEADER IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES FIVE HUNDRED CITIES. YOU GO TO LEAGUE CONFERENCES AND THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT IS THE LATEST THE BEST THE APPROPRIATE TRAINING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO THIS IS SORT OF RAISING THE BAR. ON THIS -- FIELD [inaudible] SO. I I DON'T I'M NOT WHOLLY PESSIMISTIC THAT YOU WOULDN'T SEE UNITS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT STARTED TO ORCHESTRATE THIS TRAINING. BECAUSE IT ENDS UP BEING A GAP IN YOUR PROGRAM IF IF THERE'S TRAINING AVAILABLE. IN YOUR ENSURING THAT YOUR PEOPLE ARE TRAINED. THEN THAT'S GOING TO COME TO THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS -- THANK YOU MY RESPONSE TO THAT GET OUT. YES MR Là JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. DOESN'T THAT TO KIND OF EXCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENT -- AND TRAINING CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ALREADY EXIST ALSO WITH PRIVATE TO TRAINING YES AND I HAVE YET TO HEAR PROBLEMS RELATED TO THAT. THAT THE A. B. I MEAN PEOPLE WILL STEP FOR TO PROVIDE THIS TRADE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MOST GRUELING I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS THANK YOU SCHOOLEY IN ISN'T I WILL ACTUALLY I THINK. IS ONE THOSE WHICH COMES FIRST I THINK ONCE YOU RAISE THE STANDARDS I THINK YOU GET. TO WHAT THESE LADIES ARE TALKING ABOUT HAVING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY. CODIFIES PARTICULAR STANDARDS AND ALSO -- HAVE LOOKING DISPARITIES PAPERWORK BECAUSE ONCE YOU. YOU BROUGHT THEM UP TO THAT LEVEL -- DAN DELIVERY REQUIRE THEM TO DO MORE MORE -- AS A CONTROL OFFICER IN AN IN MY EARLIER DAYS ASSISTANT DEPUTY MAYOR I WAS OVER. ANIMAL SERVICES. APARTMENT AND I REMEMBER -- THE TRAINEE THEY GOT EVEN AT THAT LEVEL -- WAS PRETTY EXTENSIVE AND AND AS HE MOVED INTO. THE NIGHT AND IN SOUTH LA. WE DON'T HAVE A WHOLE LOTTA COLLISON RACCOONS BUT WE DO HAVE PEOPLE AND YOU REALLY DO NEED TO BE TRAINED -- HEAVILY TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE THE INCIDENTS AND DANGERS THAT THAT HAPPENED WITH WITH SOME ANIMALS IN CERTAIN CERTAIN DISTRICTS SO. I APPLAUD YOU FOR BRINGING IT UP. TO A LEVEL WHERE -- DATE. I MEAN THE LEVEL OF DANGERS GOTTEN WAY. IT'S WAY UP NOW AND SO I COMMEND YOU ON DOING THIS SEARCHERS RECOMMEND AND I ON A. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER -- CANCER I LACKEY LACKEY I'VE BAUER-KAHAN BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK ALL RIGHT QUIRK I SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO I WICKS WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES VERY GOOD. NOW ITEM NUMBER. TWELVE TWENTY ONE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S. RIGHT I AM THRILLED TO BRING THE U. TWELVE TWENTY ONE WHICH DEALS WITH CHILD ADVOCACY CENTERS. ON THE IDEA OF A CHILD ADVOCACY CENTER IS TO CREATE A MULTI DISCIPLINARY UNIT. THE SUPPORTS WORK WITH CHILDREN -- AND A PURPOSE THAT REALLY THIS TYPE OF FOCUS BRING IN A VARIETY RESOURCE TOGETHER. IS [inaudible] TO HELP. SAFEGUARD THE CHILDREN ENSURE JUST OUTCOMES AND AVOID TRAUMATIZING THEM. AND I DO WANT TO NOTE ACTUALLY THE PUBLIC DEFENDERS OF RAISED A HAVE NOTED THAT THERE ARE SOME PROVISIONAL LAW. THAT HAVE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY USE OF INFORMATION. WHICH THEY REGARD AS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE OUTCOME. SO I DO NOT HAVE THAT CONFIDENTIALITY AMENDMENT TODAY BUT ACTUALLY FEEL. I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEIR RAISING THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES ALIGNED WITH PURPOSE -- THIS BILL HAS BROAD SUPPORT. UGH. CHILD ADVOCACY CENTERS BRING TOGETHER AS A SAY MULTI DESTROYED TEAM IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT CHAU PROTECTION MEDICAL PERSONNEL. MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. TO ENSURE THAT IN RESPONSE TO AN ALLEGATION OF CHILD ABUSE IS CORD IN AMONG THESE AGENCIES. AND THAT IT EEPS THE INTEREST OF THE CHILD AT THE VANGUARD OF THAT CONVERSATION THAT INVESTIGATION. I I BELIEVE THAT. THIS APPROACH PUT IN A STRONG FOCUS ON THE WELL BEING OF CHILDREN AND PROVIDING SERVICE WRITERS IT KIND OF THREAD INTO THAT. IS SO IMPORTANT FOR KIDS I THINK HONESTLY IT IS A BASIC FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT. TO FOCUS ON PROBLEMS BUT TO FIND CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS OF SO I'M. ON I KNOW THAT IN THIS TYPE OF SAID IN THE CHILDREN WILL BE LESS SUBJECT TO TRAUMA LESSER BRICK. TO HER FULL OUTCOMES OF PROMOTE HEALING -- THIS MODEL IS SEEN BY THE CONGRESS IS THE PREFERRED METHOD FOR PURSUING JUSTICE HEALING FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING AND OTHERS CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING. IN PARTICULAR. AND WE DO NOT AT THIS TIME HAVE A STATUTORY DEFINITION OF A CHILD CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER -- SO WE DO NOT HAVE MINIMUM STANDARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE -- AND I HAVE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT. OF ERIN HARPER A MY LAWYER COLLEAGUES SHE IS WITH CALICO CHILD ABUSE JUSTIN INTERVIEWING IN COORDINATION CENTER. AND ALLIE LOU WHO IS A BROUGH SURVIVOR SO I'M GONNA ASK. MISS HARPER TO JUMP IN AND IT WILL TURN ALLEY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THE SPELL. CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S BRING TOGETHER POLICE SOCIAL WORKERS PROSECUTORS DOCTORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO INVESTIGATE CHILD ABUSE CASES. INTERVIEW CHILDREN IN A CHILD FRIENDLY SETTING AND ENSURE THAT THE NECESSARY CONNECTIONS ARE MADE FOR CHILDREN EXPERIENCING ABUSE. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT CHILD -- CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER'S HAVE SEVERAL BENEFITS CHILDREN WHO CASES ARE INVESTIGATED THROUGH A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT FOLLOWING THEIR ABUSE DISCLOSURE. THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE MEDICAL HEALTHCARE. AND CASES THAT MOVED INTO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM FOLLOWING AN INVESTIGATION COORDINATED THROUGH A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER -- HAVE FASTER CHARGING DECISIONS AND FASTER CASE DISPOSITIONS WHICH REDUCES THE LEVEL OF TRAUMA TO CHILDREN. FINALLY WHEN CASES ARE COORDINATED IN THIS MANNER AND INVESTIGATED THROUGH A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER THEY COST LOCAL COMMUNITIES ON AVERAGE ONE THIRD LESS THAN INVESTIGATIONS OF ARE NOT COORDINATED THREE CHILD. CHILDREN'S PATH THAT THIS WORK HAS ON CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA AND IN A MINUTE ALLEY WILL TELL YOU HER FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THIS. AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALICO THE LOCAL CHILDREN'S AT THE CENTER FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY THAT SERVE SIX TO SEVEN HUNDRED ABUSE CHILDREN EVERY YEAR AS YOUNG AS TWO AND AS OLD AS SEVENTEEN I CAN TELL YOU FIRST HAND WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD. WHO'S BEEN HURT HAS THE ABILITY TO HEAL AND RECOVER AND THAT EVERY OFFENDER WHO HURTS CHILDREN -- HEY WE CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH THE SCORED A NEEDED WORK THAT BRINGS TOGETHER ALL OF THE EXPERTS DEALING WITH THESE CASES THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE THESE TWO OUTCOMES. THIRTY EIGHT STATES HAVE STATUTES THAT DEFINED WHAT A CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER DOES OR BEHIND THE CURVE BECAUSE WE DOUBT AS A RESULT THERE'S NO MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR WHAT PEOPLE HAVE TO ACHIEVE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING WITH ARGUABLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS IN THE COMMUNITY. THERE'S ALSO NO CLARITY AS TO WHAT FOR INVESTIGATORS FOR CLIENTS FOR FAMILIES FOR JUDGES FOR PROSECUTORS AS TO WHAT. A CHILDREN'S ACSI CENTER SHOULD BE OFFERING AND WHAT SERVICES THEY SHOULD PROVIDE THIS IS A SIMPLE BILL BUT IT'LL BE AN ENORMOUS STEP FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA IN ACHIEVING JUSTICE AND HEALING FOR ABUSED CHILDREN THANK YOU [inaudible] YES [inaudible] MAY BEGIN. GOOD MORNING I'M ELLIE LEO. I GRADUATED FROM DUBLIN HIGH AND NOW NURSING STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. I'M ALSO THE FOUNDER OF THE STUDENT GROUP PLUSHIE SAME TO COMFORT HEART SORE PATCH. I FOUND ATTACHED TO HELP CHILDREN IN CRISES PARTICULARLY -- VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE BY PROVIDING THEM WITH STUFFED ANIMALS AS COMFORT ITEMS. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE COLLECTED OVER TWO THOUSAND STUFFED ANIMALS MOST OF WHICH WERE DONATED TO CALICO'S SENT TO GET TO THE CHILDREN THAT THEY SERVE. I STARTED PATCH BECAUSE I WAS A VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE AND A FORMER CLIENT OF CALICO. WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD I WAS SEXUALLY ABUSED BY A FAMILY FRIEND? AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE IS HARD FOR ME TO PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED TO ME BUT I KNEW THAT I HAD BEEN HURT. I WAS SCARED AND CONFUSED AND MOST OF ALL IT I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT. AFTER WE'VE HAD SUPPORTED THE CASE TO THE POLICE. I REMEMBER BEING BROUGHT TO CALICO. I MET WITH THEIR KIND AND CARING STAFF. THE CALICO TEAM HELP ME FEEL SAFE AND LOVED WHICH ALLOWED ME TO OPEN UP TO THEM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME -- THERE A COMFORTING AND ENCOURAGING AS EXPLAINED THE SITUATION TO ME USING TERMS THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND. EVEN TO TODAY ELEVEN YEARS LATER I STILL REMEMBER HOW IT FELT SITTING. NOT BEING CO THE CHAIR HUGGING MY RIGHTLY LARGE TEAL STUFFED BUNNY AND FINDING THE COURAGE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS POSED TO ME BY THE CALICO INTERVIEWERS. LOOKING BACK NOW I REALIZE HOW FORTUNATE WAS TO HAVE THE CALCHAS CENTER IN MY COUNTY. IF IT WASN'T FOR THE TRAIN MULTI DISCIPLINARY RESPONSE TEAM AT CALICO I WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED MANY TIMES BY DIFFERENT AGENCIES FORCED TO REALLY -- RELIVE EASILY THE WORST PART OF MY LIFE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HOWEVER MANY VICTIMS OF CHILD ABUSE ARE NOT AS FORTUNATE AS I WAS TO HAVE A CALICO CENTER IN THEIR AREA -- CALCHAS MODEL NEEDS TO BE REPLICATED IN EVERY COUNTY OF FOR STATE. EVERY VICTIM OF CHILD ABUSE DESERVES TO BE PROTECTED FROM BEING FURTHER VICTIMIZED BY THE INVESTOR -- PLASTIC A TORY PROCESS. SOMETHING THAT CAN ONLY BE MADE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE USE OF MULTI DISCIPLINARY CHILD ADVOCACY CENTERS LIKE CALICO THAT'S WHY I URGE YOU.

B.. NINE TWENTY SEVEN YOU MAY BEGIN WHICH ONE OF MY MOVIE DEL. NINE TWENTY SEVEN NINE TWENTY SEVEN AB NINE TWENTY SEVEN REVISED THE STATE LAW BY REQUIRING A FINDING OF A DEPEND DISABILITIES TO PAY PRIOR TO THE ASSESSMENT OF A FINER FEE. IN CALIFORNIA BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND PENAL CODE CONTAINS SECTIONS THAT REQUIRE COURT TO ASSESS FEES AND FINES AND CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. THESE BONDS ARE ASSESSED WITHOUT REGARD TO DEFEND HIS ABILITY TO PAY FUNDS RECEIVED. BY MONEY FOR AT LEAST FIFTY DIFFERENT STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAM TO IDENTIFY BUT IT. LA OWES OFFICE THIS EFFECTIVELY CREATES A SYSTEM THAT PUNCH COURTS STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL NEEDS ON THE BACKS OF POOR PEOPLE. THERE IS OVER TEN BILLION AN OUTSTANDING FEE AND FIND THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE CLEARLY SHOWS THAT WE ARE OVER RELIANCE ON ON COLLECTIBLES FINES FROM A POOR DEFENDANTS. IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THESE HAPPY FINES ARE OFTEN LEVIED ON THE POOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL. FOLLOWING THE WORK DONE BY THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S COURT SYSTEM HAS BEEN WORKING ON A PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALLOW DEFENDED TO SEEK REDUCED AWAY FEES FOR TRAFFIC FIGHTS. TRAFFIC PIES MAKE UP TWO THIRDS OF CURRENT ASSESS BINDS. THE BILL ADDRESSES THE REMAINING THIRD THE FINES LEVIED AFTER A MISDEMEANOR OR FELONY THIS BILL DOES THREE THINGS FIRST ECLIPSE THE PRESUMPTION OF ABILITY TO PAY FROM THE DEFENDANT TO THE PROSECUTION REQUIRE THEM TO SHOW AN ABILITY TO PAY WHEN. THAT IS IN QUESTION SECOND REQUIRE CREATES A PRESUMPTION THAT THE HOMELESS THOSE ON THOSE IN NEED. BASED ASSISTANCE -- THOSE MEETINGS THOUGH DOES MEETING THE DEFINITION OF VERY LOW INCOME AND THOSE SENTENCED TO LENGTHY SENTENCES ON ARE UNABLE TO PAY. FINALLY ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF FACTORS FOR COURTS TO CONSIDER WHEN EVALUATING ABILITY TO PAY INCLUDING WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT HAD A PUBLIC DEFENDER. THIS BILL IS IN LINE WITH RECENT COURT RULINGS IN THIS AREA THE SECOND COURT OF APPEALS IN CALIFORNIA HELL THAT IMPOSING FINES WITHOUT AN ASSESSMENT OF ABILITY TO PAY WAS A VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS. TO SPRING COURT ALSO NOTED THAT EXCESSIVE FINES ARE A THREAT TO CIVIL LIBERTIES IN A RECENT TIM'S VERSUS INDIANA CASE THIS IS A PROPER BUILD IT BALANCES CIVIL LIBERTIES. COURT. WORKLOAD AND A FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF FAIRNESS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY AND IS A BLANK IN HERE IS MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL -- NOT ONLY DOES IT MAKE FINES AND FEES AND CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTIONAL IT ALSO SAVES TIME AND MONEY. IT IS POINTLESS TO HAVE ON ABILITY TO PAY HEARING AFTER ABILITY TO PAY HEARING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS -- REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER AND CLEARLY ON GOVERNMENT THEN THE BENEFITS AND INDICATE THAT THEY'RE INDIGENT. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK THAT YOU. YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. REBEKAH GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN SUPPORT.

POPULAR COMMITTEE -- ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB EIGHT SEVEN NINE GIPSON BOB FIREARMS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHT SEVEN NINE WITH SIX TO CLOSE THE GOALS GUN LOOPHOLE BY REQUIRING THE STATE BACKGROUND CHECK FOR PURCHASERS. OF ON FINISHED OF FRAME AND RECEIVER. RECEIVER SKEWS THE LOWER RECEIVER THEN CAN BE COMPLETED EASILY BY DRILLING A FEW REMAINING HOLES INTO THE UNFINISHED -- METAL SHALE. IT IS READY FOR A BARREL A TRIGGER MACHINE STOCK UPPER A RECEIVER OF FORD TO BE ATTACHED. NOT TOO LONG AGO. THERE WAS A SHOOTING. AND RANCHO OF NORTH CARROLL SKEWS ME NORTH KALANAUR CALIFORNIA NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE A MAN MURDERED FIVE PEOPLE INCLUDING HIS WIFE WITH THE GOALS GUN. THIS MAN WAS PROHIBITED FROM PURCHASING A FIREARM SO HE TOOK TO THE INTERNET. TO BUY PARTS TO BUILD HIS OWN GUN. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE IN SANTA MONICA IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHERE A MAN A TEN TO TO PURCHASE A FAR ARM BUT WAS NOT ALLOWED. TO AFTER THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- FOUND HIM TO BE IN ELIGIBLE. HE THEN RESORTED TO BUILDING HIS OWN GUN -- WHICH HE USED TO KILL FIVE PEOPLE. INJURING SEVERAL OTHERS CURRENT LAW REQUIRES A BACKGROUND CHECK FOR BOTH GUN SELLER AND THE AMMUNITION AND IS BUT YET -- ON THIS MATTER -- LAW IS SILENCE IN TERMS OF FIRE. ARM PARTS THIS BILL INTENDS TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY BY PREVENTING CRIMINALS AND THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT OTHERWISE POSSESS THE FAR ARM FROM GAINING ACCESS WHILE PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF GUN. OWNERS WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS AMANDA WILCOX WHEN THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. YES GOOD MORNING AMANDA WILCOX ACTUAR NEW NAME ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE NOW BRADY CALIFORNIA. ARE PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY -- THE PROBLEM OF SELF MANUFACTURED IN CELLPHONE SAM ASSEMBLE GUNS VERTICALLY OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE PROHIBITED FROM OWNING FIREARMS. IN IN CALIFORNIA IS ESCALATING PROBLEM WE KNOW THIS FROM NEWS REPORTS -- YOU KNOW THE STORY AT THE OF THE SHOOTING IN SANTA MONICA THE TERRIBLE ONE RANCH ATTAIN TO HIM -- AND I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY MORE. MY OWN PERSONAL -- CONNECTION WITH THIS ISSUE IS WHEN THAT PERSON WHO CAME TO INSTALL A NEW INTERNET SERVICE IN OUR HOUSE AND HE ALSO HAS A MACHINE SHOP. AND AS A DRILL PRESS AND HE TOLD US MY HUSBAND ME THAT. ALL THE TIME PEOPLE COME WITH HER I'M FINISH RECEIVER TO HIS SHOP AND ASK HIM TO COMPLY TO DRILL THE THE REQUIRED HOLES TO TURN IT INTO A COMPLETE RECEIVER THIS IS A PROBLEM -- AS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE WITH A. B. A FIVE SEVEN IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN ARE WHICH REQUIRES ANYONE WHO HAS MANUFACTURED OR SOME OF THE FIREARM TO GET A SERIAL NUMBER FROM THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE AND ALONG WITH THAT THERE WOULD BE A BACKGROUND CHECK AND RECORD. THIS BILL GOES FURTHER TO TRY AND PREVENT -- ACQUISITION OF THESE PARTS BY PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT IS FAR BETTER. THIS IS NARROWER THAN LAST YEAR'S VERSION I KNOW THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT HOW DO YOU DEFINE ALL THESE PARTS AND ARE WE CONCLUDING SPRINGS AND OTHER THINGS -- SO THIS REALLY -- FOCUSES ON THE KEY ELEMENTS WHICH IS THE ON FINISH FRAME AND RECEIVER WHICH IS WHAT IT SHOULD DO AND IT SETS UP A SYSTEM WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A PRECURSOR PART FENDER. TO ACQUIRE THESE PASS A BACKGROUND CHECK INSTANT CHECK I AND SHOW THAT YOU'RE NOT PROHIBITED BEFORE YOU ACQUIRE AND THAT IS OUR GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED. DANGEROUS BECAUSE OF THEIR CONDITION OR PAST HISTORY AND HAVE A FIRE PROHIBITION THAT INSTEAD THEY CAN MAKE THEIR I IN THAT SAMPLE THEIR OWN GUNS THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO STOP SO I URGE YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] EITHER [inaudible] ANOTHER WITNESS. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. REBEKAH GONZALEZ VOLUNTEER WITH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE A WITNESS IN SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SPEAKING DO YOU NEED MORE ROOM. KATHY WANNA COULD. FEEL LEFT FIVE SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO SPLIT IT UP. OKAY I'LL GET STARTED WELL WE PLAY MUSICAL CHAIRS HERE -- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. I THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND ON THE THE EXAM AMMUNITION SYSTEM THAT WE CAN USE FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS I WAS. PASSED THROUGH INITIATIVE IN STATUTE A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE STILL ACTUALLY HAVE. DON'T HAVE FINAL RAGS ON THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EMPLOYMENT UNTIL JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF QUESTIONS SURROUNDING THAT SYSTEM IN IN THIS SEEKS TO EXPAND ON THAT SYSTEM TO RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK PORTION -- AND THERE'S SOME SERIOUS QUESTIONS ON ON HOW APPS CAN BE USED BECAUSE OF BIG GETTING TIED INTO THE NEXT SYSTEM AND SO -- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AND AND I THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO EXPAND A SYSTEM THAT. WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GONNA WORK -- FURTHER THIS BILLS INCREDIBLY VAGUE -- I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN TIGHTENED SINCE THE LAST ITERATION -- BUT IT'S STILL BEGS THE QUESTION WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE AN UNFINISHED FRAME AT WHAT POINT DOES A HUNK OF METAL. BECOME A FRIEND OR AN ON FINISH FRAME HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH THAT -- YOU KNOW WHAT I WHAT POINT IS A BLOCK AND A GOING TO FALL UNDER THIS IN AND HOW IS LAW ENFORCEMENT. EXACTLY SUPPOSED TO ENFORCE THIS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PARTS OF THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THEY DON'T HAVE UNIQUE SERIAL NUMBERS HOW ARE YOU GOING TO TELL WHETHER WAS PURCHASED. AND TWO THOUSAND THREE OR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN I THINK IT BECOMES AN ENFORCEMENT NIGHTMARE ALSO THESE ARE PARTS OF THE GUN SO IS LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPOSED TO TAKE APART THE GUN OR THEY'RE JUST. EXPECTING TOUGH TO FIND SOMEONE WITH THE A COUPLE OF THESE LAYING AROUND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT FIRE ARMS -- DID THE ACTUAL FRAME DID IS DETERMINED TO BE THE FIREARM AND THAT'S WHERE THE UNIQUE NUMBER IS THAT'S WORTH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE SERIAL NUMBER -- AND SO THERE IS A WAY -- TO TO TRACK THAT -- AND SO I JUST THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE IN IT FOR SMITH NIGHTMARE -- I THINK THIS IS UNNECESSARY AND ALSO WHAT IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO DO IF THEY'RE OUT OF STATE LET'S SAY YOU'RE OUT OF STATE AND YOU HAVE A FARM THAT BREAKS DOWN YOU NEED TO BUY A PART. TWO TO MAKE IT -- COMPLIANT -- BEFORE YOU COME BACK IN CALIFORNIA RESPONSE TAKE PART THAT GUN AND SHIP IT TO A PRECURSOR PARTS DEALER I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS. A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT CRAZY FOR COMPLIANCE -- I THINK CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO IGNORE THIS LAW THERE CAN OPERATE OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. AND I I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE ANY PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFIT WITH THAT ONE OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GOVERNMENTS CALIFORNIA I ECHO MY COLLEAGUES -- COMMENTS HERE OF WITH DESCRIPTION OF THIS BILL COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE THAT ARE OF CONCERN TO ME -- IN THE ANALYSIS HERE TALKSABOUT -- A TRIGGER PACK OR FIRE CONTROL GROUP FOR HITLER **** OR A PUBLIC NATIONAL F. A. N. F. A. L.. STYLE FARM THOSE ARE ALREADY LEGAL THEY'RE ALREADY A LIVE BAND UNDER THE THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO -- IF SOMEBODY HAS THOSE IT'S A IT'S ALREADY ILLEGAL TO TO BE IN IN POSSESSION OF THOSE -- PEOPLE DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT. ONE OF THESE RECEIVERS THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO A GUN. DOESN'T HAVE TO HAVE ANY SHAPE OR INDENTATIONS OR ANYTHING ON THE OUTSIDE IT COULD BE A BLOCK. OF YOUR ALUMINUM OR STEEL. AND ALL IT IS IS THE INTERNAL DRILLING. THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT. YOU CAN HAVE A GUN THAT IS A NAY ARE. FIFTEEN BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT IT LOOKS LIKE A BLOCK OF ALUMINUM ALL OF THE STUFF ON THE OUTSIDE IS PURELY COSMETIC. SO WHEN YOU'RE ASKING -- FOR YOU KNOW MOULDER SHAPE POLYMER FRAME TO RECEIVERS LIKE IT. OKAY. THEY DON'T GET THEM DON'T JUST DO A LOT OF A LOT OF A STRAIGHT BLOCK AND THEY DON'T DO ANY OF THE CONTOURING ON THE OUTSIDE FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES. AT WHAT POINT DOES A BARREL QUALIFY A BARREL IS A PIPE IT'S A BLOCK OF A TUBE OF STEEL THAT STARTS OUT SOLID. IT IS DRILLED AND THEN RIFLE. IT HAS NOW BEEN MACHINE. BUT IT CAN FUNCTION FOR ALMOST ANY FIREARM OF THAT CALIBER. I AND SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO START BANNING ALL BARREL BERYL BLANKS OR OR OR OR ITEMS LIKE THIS FLATS. THE FLAT START OUT AS THE BLOCK A FLAT OF METAL. NOTHING ON IT. JUST A YOU CAN GO TO HOME DEPOT AND BUY PIECES OF METAL THAT YOU CAN TURN IN THE FIRE -- FARMS RIGHT NOW SO THIS BILL I I THINK ISN'T IN IN SEARCH OF OF OF A OF A A PROBLEM THAT THEY YOU CAN GET YOUR HANDS AROUND CRIMINALS ARE CRIMINALS THEY'RE GOING. TO GET GUNS STEAL GUNS MAKE GUNS DO WHATEVER THEY CAN AND IS UNTIL WE START FOCUSING ON THE CRIMINALS INSTEAD OF THE THE GUNS THAT THEY CAN MANUFACTURE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STOP THEM FROM DOING THAT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS CRIMINAL MISUSE FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS GUNNERS CALIFORNIA IS IN OPPOSITION. OPEN THE QUESTIONS. TO THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAMED ORGANIZATION THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHOLIC REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION OUTDOOR SPORTS SINCE COALITION A CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA SPORTSMAN'S AUDIENCE FIGHT CLUB INTERNATIONAL ALL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- SO WE'VE PASSED A LOT OF VERY GOOD READ VERY GOOD LEGISLATION. ON GUIDANCE. BUT I THINK THAT WE'VE PASSED SO MUCH. THAT IT'S GETTING HARD TO FIND GOOD ADDITIONAL BILLS AND I THINK THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF PROBLEMS. IF IT WERE JUST THE RECEIVER I COULD SEE IT BUT ALL THESE OTHER PARTS. I THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS A LOT OF GOOD POINTS NOW I I'M GOING TO MOVE THE BILL NOW -- IF SOMEONE WILL GIVE ME A SECOND. AND BUT I'D SUGGEST THAT YOU REALLY LOOK AT THIS BEFORE IT'S GOING TO GO TO APPROPRIATIONS IS LIKELY TO BE VERY EXPENSIVE. I REALLY THINK YOU DO BE VERY WELL OFF TO TO NARROW THE BILL. AND I THINK THERE WAS A COUPLE OF BILLS HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN FROM THE COMMITTEE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FULLY BAKED. ARM I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE MUCH MORE CAREFUL GOING FORWARD ON OUR GUN BELTS AND I'M SPECIFICALLY SPEAKING TO THE EFFORTS AND THE BRADY CAMPAIGN. I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SCRUB THESE BILLS BETTER BECAUSE WE'VE DONE SO MUCH ALREADY. AND AGAIN I'M WILLING TO GO THIS FORWARD TO GIVE YOU A VEHICLE BUT I'M NOT AT ALL SURE I CAN VOTE FOR IT ON THE FLOOR. SO PLEASE THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT ALL THIS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAKE CLOTHES MISTER GIPSON IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY THE OPPOSITION ABSOLUTELY AND MOST IMPORTANT -- ADDRESSING CONCERNS INITIAL QUIRK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- MEMBER DOT QUIRK FOR HERE'S COMMENTS AND CONCERNED I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT LAST TIME LAST YEAR WHEN I BROUGHT THIS BILL FORWARD -- GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED THE BILL -- WITH A VETO MESSAGE THAT BILL WAS -- THE PREVIOUS BILL WAS BROUGHT THIS IS MUCH NARROWER TAKING WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAVE SAID WORKING CLOSER CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND WE HAVE THIS BILL BEFORE YOU.

IN LOS ANGELES -- IS STILL AWAITING TRIAL HE WAS ARRESTED FOR PRODUCING GHOST GUNS AND ALSO SELLING THESE GOES GUNS TO THE CRIPS AND THE BLOODS. THAT'S IN LOS ANGELES SO WE TALK ABOUT -- IS THIS A GROWING -- ISSUE IT IS A GROWING ISSUE -- IN OUR COUNTRY AND I THINK WE SIDE IN ARTICULATED -- THESE PARTICULAR POINTS -- WANNA MAKE UP OR AT LEAST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT THE OPPOSITION -- THIS HAS A A BACKGROUND CHECK ON YOU CANNOT TAKE A PIECE OF METAL OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL CLEARLY. PHOTOGRAPH WHETHER RISK OF UNFINISHED RECEIVER AND UNFINISHED FRAME AND RECEIVE IT LOOKS LIKE ONCE HIS BILL IS PASSED SO THEY'LL BE NO AMBIGUITY NO GRAY AREA PEOPLE VERY CLEAR LONG FORCE WILL BE VERY CLEAR. THAT THEY CAN'T TAKE A BLOCK OF METAL AND ARREST SOMEONE IT'S ONLY WHEN HIS SPANISH IS WHERE AN ENEMY IT'S THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE WILL GIVE GUIDANCE. IT MEETS THAT CRITERIA THEN IT'S IT'S A PERMISSIBLE ARE NOT PERMITTED -- AS RELATES -- TO THE NEW BILL IN THE BILL LANGUAGE TODAY IN ADDITION TO THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US -- IN THIS LANGUAGE EVEN TO THE POINT ASKING US. TO ADD INTO THE BILL THE TRIGGER PACKAGE THIS IS THE LANGUAGE THEY ASKED US TO ACTUALLY PUT INTO THE BILL SO WE DID THAT WE WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY. WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- ONE OF MY OPPONENTS MADE INDICA INDICATION REGARDING THIS IS A NIGHTMARE WITH THE NIGHTMARES OF FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES THE NIGHTMARE IS INDIVIDUALS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVES I'M IN SANTA MONICA. THAT'S THE REAL NIGHTMARE AND WE MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND GET IN FRONT OF THE SITUATION AND SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN AYE VOTE AGAIN THIS BILL IS A DIFFERENT BILL THAT CAME BEFORE THIS BODY -- WE NARROWED THE SCOPE -- AND THAT BILLS BEFORE TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK -- FOR AYE VOTE -- WE ARE DAVID WE ARE DAVID.

THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON AND I WOULD -- TOO ALONG WITH MR QUIRK OF THE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO SELL IT TO REALLY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS ABSOLUTELY IF YOU CAN GET THEM TO HELP EXPLAIN HOW THEY ARE GOING TO ADMINISTRATIVE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAVEN'T. I LOVE. MY ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE JUST BY HAVING ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD AT IMPLEMENTING [inaudible] RETRIEVING -- FIREARMS OFF THE STREET AND SO THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. WHERE? LOW'S ADDITIONAL BUDGET PUBLIC SAFETY BUT YOU WERE MORE WILLING TO GIVE THEM ENOUGH RESOURCES AND AND MONEY AND THAT THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THIS BILL IS ENACTED. A WHICH IS A VALID POINT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT AND SO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING THAT THEY NEED.

YOU HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION WHICH I THINK WILL HELP SOME MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE MOVE THE FOUR ON THE FLOOR WITH THE HOPEFULLY ONCE HE GETS OUT HIS COMMITTEE -- I'M JUST SAYING. DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT AND MAKE SURE IT'S DONE I KNOW YOUR PASSION PASSION ABOUT IT IS SO -- I DO CHAIRS RECOMMENDED II AND AND I WANT YOU TO KEEP AN EYE ON MAKING SURE WE DO THIS THE CORRECT WAY MISS CHIRLA CHIP CALLED ROLE. ON AB EIGHT SEVENTY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER CHEN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NOPE BAUER-KAHAN HI BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP NO KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK QUIRK I SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO I'D WICKS HI WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIR OF COMMITTEE. NOW IT MISTER MEDINA. ITEM NUMBER -- FOR SEVEN BILL NUMBERS. NINE SIX FOUR COURT COUNTY JAIL VISITATIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. NINE SIX FOUR AB NINE SIX FOUR WILL REQUIRE ALL LOCAL DETENTION FACILITIES TO OFFER IN PERSON VISITATION BY THE YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE BILL SEEKS TO GIVE INCARCERATED PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN A PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. BOTTOM LINE VIDEO VISITS ARE NOT EQUIVALENT TO IN PERSON VISITS AND ARE MUCH LESS PREFERRED THAT IS A MUCH LESS PREFERRED WAY. TO MAINTAIN CONTACT. NOWHERE DO WE DESIRE TO TREAT THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED AS UNDESERVING. INCARCERATED MEN AND WOMEN REMAIN BEING. FATHERS MOTHERS SISTERS BROTHERS DAUGHTERS SONS AND PARTNERS. WHILE THERE INCARCERATED. HUMAN CONNECTIONS CAN OFFER ACCOUNTABILITY AND MOTIVATION THAT LEADS TO CHANGE. ELIMINATING IN PERSON VISITATION HAS A DRASTIC A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON FAMILIES PARTICULARLY CHILDREN. ALSO ACCORDING TO REPORT BY THE PRISON POLICY INITIATIVE VIDEO VISITATION. IS IS NO WHERE -- AS AFFECTED AS IN PERSON VISITATION. THERE BEEN REPORTS OF MALFUNCTIONS DELAYS AND FREEZES WITH VIDEO VISITATIONS. SOME HAVE INDICATED THAT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. WHERE TRADITIONAL TELECOMS LIKE EIGHTEEN T. AND VERIZON FOCUS ON THE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE? IT IS EVIDENT THAT THESE COMPANIES CONTRACT WITH LOCAL CONTROL FACILITIES FOCUS ONLY ON THE FACILITIES AND NOT WHETHER IT WAS A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. FOR THOSE USING THAT METHOD OF VISITATION. WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RABBI SUZANNE SINGER AND LEASE. LIZZY MOTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THERE ARE TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES IN JUDAISM THE GUIDE HOW WE TREAT HUMAN BEINGS. AND I THINK THIS APPLIES TO OTHER RELIGIONS AS WELL THE FIRST IS THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED BUT CELLUM ELLO HE MADE IN GOD'S IMAGE. THE SECOND IS TO SHOE Và. WHICH IS OFTEN TRANSLATED AS REPENTANCE BUT WHICH REALLY MEANS RETURN. THE IDEA IS THAT IF AND WHEN WE VEER OFF THE RIGHT PATH -- ALWAYS ABLE TO COME BACK TO RETURN. SO BASED ON THESE VALUES AS A RABBI I BELIEVE THAT IT IS OUR JOB AS A SOCIETY. TO RE INTEGRATE OFFENDERS BACK INTO SOCIETY SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS AND RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. SO I WAS HORRIFIED TO LEARN THAT THE NEW COUNTY JAIL IN INDIO IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. WAS BUILT WITH NO IN PERSON VISITS BUT ONLY VIDEO CALLS. THIS IS DE HUMANIZING FOR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED. CONTACT WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS IS ABSOLUTELY KEY TO REHABILITATION. STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THE PRISONERS TO MAINTAIN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WHILE INCARCERATED. HAVE BETTER POST RELEASE OUTCOMES AND LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES. ADDITIONALLY VIDEOTAPING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES HAVE COME UNDER CRITICISM FOR CHARGING HIGH FEES. AND FOR PROVIDING POOR QUALITY VIDEO CONNECTIONS. VIDEO CAN BE INCREASED INCREDIBLY COSTLY NOT JUST FOR THE INMATE BUT FOR THE LOVED ONES AS WELL. THE COST OF THE VIDEO CALL CAN BE AS MUCH AS A DOLLAR A MINUTE. ACCORDING TO THE PRISON POLICY INITIATIVE. AND THE PEOPLE PAYING FOR THESE CALLS ARE THOSE WHO ARE LEAST LIKELY TO AFFORD IT. FURTHERMORE ES ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF MEDINA HAS NOTED VIDEO TECHNOLOGY OFTEN DISCONNECTS AND OUR JOBS AND SKIPS DURING THE CALL MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO FOCUS. AND THERE IS ANOTHER CRUCIAL ISSUE. THE CHILDREN OF THOSE INCARCERATED ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE TRAUMA OF BEING SEPARATED FROM THEIR PARENTS. VIDEO CALLS ONLY PRESENT A FURTHER BARRIER TO THESE CHILDREN MAINTAINING A CLOSE CONNECTION WITH THEIR PARENTS. THE BIBLE MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE BOND OF LIFE BETWEEN A PARENT AND CHILD EVEN AMONG ANIMALS IS STRONG. AND SACRED. THE ARGUMENT THE JAIL TIME IS SHORTER THAN PRISON TIME SO CAN BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY NO LONGER HOLDS. EVER SINCE REALIGNMENT MORE PEOPLE ARE SERVING TIME IN COUNTY JAILS AND FOR LONGER PERIODS THAN BEFORE. WITH ONE MILLION PEOPLE PRESENTLY SERVING IN CALIFORNIA JAILS. THIS IS AN ENORMOUS POPULATION WE ARE PROPOSING TO DE HUMANIZE AND THEIR PEOPLE WERE GOING TO COME BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY. IF WE INSIST ON VIDEO CALLS RATHER THAN IN PERSON VISITS. WILL BE FORWARDING EFFORTS TO UNITE OFFENDERS WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND THEIR ABILITY TO REINTEGRATE INTO SOCIETY. I APPLAUD ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA IS INTRODUCTION OF EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FOUR WHICH REQUIRES CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO PROVIDE IN PERSON VISITATIONS. VIDEO CALL SHOULD SERVE AS A SUPPLEMENT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR IN PERSON FOR VISITATIONS. AB NINE SIXTY FOUR WILL STRENGTHEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN CARS RATED PEOPLE. AND THEIR LOVED ONES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU YES GOOD MORNING LIZZIE BEACON WITH ACLU OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. NINE SIX FOUR I THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE THAT A NUMBER OF JAILS DENY INCARCERATED PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES OPPORTUNITY. FOR MEANINGFUL VISITATION WHICH MEANS THAT THE ONLY WAY THAT PEOPLE IN THESE JAILS CAN SEE THEIR LOVED ONES IS THERE A VIDEO SCREEN. THIS WOULD BE BAD ENOUGH IF IT WAS FACE TIME OR SKYPE BUT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM. A MISTER BAD MEDINA AND AND THE RABBI THAT. THEY SYSTEMS ARE FAR WORSE AND THAT'S WHY THE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT NGUYEN JAILS ELIMINATE IN PERSON VISITATION REPLACE THEM WITH VIDEO CALLS. THAT THE NUMBER OF THE SO CALLED VISITS GOES DOWN PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO DO VIDEO CALLS AND THEY WERE TO DO VISITATION. AND DEPART THE DEPARTMENT ADDRESSES THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS SHOWN THAT IN THAT VISITATION IS CRITICAL FOR PRESERVING FAMILY STABILITY -- IN SUPPORTING SUCCESSFUL REENTRY THIS HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN FOR VIDEO VISITATION -- IN FACT NGUYEN JAILS HAVE ELIMINATED IMPORTS VISITATION REPLACEABLE VIDEO CALLS -- DISCIPLINARY INFRACTIONS -- GO UP CONTRABAND GOES UP. ON IT SO IT IT HAS BEEN A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHERE IT HAS TAKEN PLACE. THIS BILL. IS ULTIMATELY ABOUT RESPECTING THE HUMANITY AND DIGNITY OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES INCARCERATED PEOPLE HAVE CHILDREN THEY HAVE BROTHERS AND SISTERS THEY HAVE SPOUSES THEY ARE THEMSELVES CHILDREN OF OTHER PEOPLE -- AND PROHIBITING THEM AND THEIR LOVED ONES FROM SEEING EACH OTHER IN PERSON FOR YEARS AND OFTEN AT SOMETIMES MORE THAN MORE THAN TEN YEARS -- PEOPLE ARE INCARCERATED IN COUNTY JAILS THESE DAYS I IS IS IN HUMANE. MOST OF OUR JAILS PROVIDE IN PERSON VISITATION. ALL OF OUR PRISONS PROVIDE IN PERSON VISITATION AND EVEN CONTACT VISITATION OUR STATE PRESENCE SO IT IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT -- THAT MOST OF OUR CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS HAVE RECOGNIZE IS CRITICAL. AB SIX NINE SIXTY FOUR SETS A VERY REASONABLE TIMELINE FOR THOSE DEALS THAT DO NOT PROVIDE IN PERSON VISITATION. ADD TO TO TO COME UP INTO COMPLIANCE IT'S UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MANY OF THE JAILS THAT DO NOT CURRENTLY PROVIDING PERSON VISITATION HAVE IN THE PAST AND CAN. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CAPACITY TO DO SO SO -- WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY. SUCH REASONABLE TIME LINE IS VERY CRITICAL BILL ENDS FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. JIM LIMBURG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA -- WE CO SPONSORED A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL THAT THIS COMMITTEE PASSED SO I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. FOR BRINGING THIS ISSUE BACK VERY QUICKLY I'LL JUST SAY THAT WHEN THE LEGISLATIVE VOTED FOR REALIGNMENT AND TO FIND NEW JAIL CONSTRUCTION THEY WEREN'T ANTICIPATING THAT WOULD WE DOING AWAY WITH IN PERSON VISITATION THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE AND FOR THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DOMINIQUE NON FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. YOU. MORNING ERIC ANDERSON FOR INITIATE JUSTICE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. KYLE MOTHER KIANA SIXTY WITH ME WORKS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. IT'S NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ I'M HALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING JOHN MCMAHON FROM SAN BERNADINO COUNTY. I UNDERSTAND THE REASON THAT MISTER MEDINA BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I BELIEVE WE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE A COUPLE YEARS BACK. AND ULTIMATELY THE BORDER STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS CAME UP WITH NEW REGULATIONS. THAT IN ESSENCE PROHIBITED ANY NEW FACILITIES FROM BEING BUILT THAT DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN IN PERSON VISITATION. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACILITIES IN OUR STATE ONE OF WHICH IN OUR COUNTY. THAT HAS SOLELY VIDEO VISITATION. THAT FACILITY WAS BUILT USING A. B. NINE HUNDRED MONEY. APPROVED BY THE STATE BOARD OF A BORDER STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS AS WELL AS THE LOCAL. FACILITIES THAT ALLOW CONSTRUCTION IN OUR COUNTY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL. DONE WITH GRANT FUNDING. WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE VIDEO VISITATION ONLY AT THE TIME IT WAS A BILL. FOR US TO CHANGE THAT ONE FACILITY AND TO IN PERSON VISITATION. WILL BE A HUGE PROBLEM FOR US. NONE OF ROOM ON THAT SITE TO BUILD A SEPARATE BUILDING. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH ROOM WITHIN THE EXISTING WALLS TO FACILITATE. IN PERSON VISITATION. THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY. CONSTRUCTION OF A BUILDING OFF SITE. AND THE ONGOING COSTS WHICH WOULD BE INEXPENSIVE IN THE BEGINNING COMPARED TO THE ONGOING COST. OF TRANSPORTING INMATES BACK AND FORTH TO THAT FACILITY FOR VISITATION. AND I'VE HEARD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT VIDEO VISITATION AND THE QUALITY OF THIS I'M NOT SURE OF WHAT -- OTHER FOLKS ARE USING FOR VENDORS BUT IN OUR FACILITY IT WORKS WELL. WE HAVE VERY FEW COMPLAINTS ON OCCASION THE SYSTEM JUST GOES DOWN LIKE ANY OTHER SYSTEM WOULD. VERY RARE AND WHEN THAT OCCURS WE ALLOW ADDITIONAL TIME. FOR VISITING ONCE THE SYSTEMS BACK UP. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MEASURE MEMBERS COURCELLES ALONG WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- REGRETTABLY HERE IN OPPOSITION -- SURE MCMAHON SAID -- THERE'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT DISCUSSION AND DEBATE OVER THIS ISSUE OF VIDEO VISITATION TO COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE -- GOVERNOR IN FACT -- VETOED A BILL SB ELEVEN FIFTY SEVEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WOULD HAVE ADDRESSED A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES AND IN FACT WAS SIMILAR IN CONCEPT -- IN IN THE WAKE OF THAT VETO THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED -- THE BOARD AND STAKEHOLDERS TO COME TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIND A SOLUTION OR TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OF IN PERSON VERSUS VIDEO VISITATION. AND IN THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN STATE BUDGET THERE WAS A CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE -- IT IT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF THINGS ANY NEW PROJECT WITH RELINQUISH SHELL FUNDS HAD TO INCLUDE -- IN PERSON VISITATION THERE WAS A PROHIBITION -- ON CONVERTING -- FROM IN PERSON VIDEO VISITATION TO VIDEO VISITATION ONLY -- AFTER JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO EVEN RETROACTIVE TO THE BUDGET AGREEMENT -- THERE WAS A LANGUAGE THAT SAID YOU CAN'T CHANGE YOU CAN'T CHARGE FOR ON SITE VISITATION WHETHER IT'S OFFERED IN PERSON OR THROUGH A VIDEO -- AND THAT IF YOU OFFER REMOTE VISITATION THAT THE FIRST HOUR OF REMOTE VISITATION HAS TO BE FREE EACH WEEK -- AGAIN THIS WAS A COMPROMISE TO AVOID THE TYPES OF HUGE CRUSHING MANDATES THAT SHERIFF MCMAHON SPOKE ABOUT IT JUST ONE FACILITY BUT THERE ARE COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE. WHO BUILT THEIR FACILITIES WITH STATE MONEY WHEN IT WAS APPROPRIATE AND WHEN IT WAS PERMITTED AT THE TIME -- TO HAVE VIDEO VISITATION ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITY NEEDS -- AND FRANKLY THE COUNTIES WERE FOLLOWING THE LAW AT THE TIME AND AND THIS BILL AND PRAYER EFFORTS TO MOVE THE GOAL POSTS AND SAY. YOU KNOW WE SAID THIS WAS OK THEN BUT BUT NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND CHANGE IT AND AND IN DOING SO IMPOSE MASSIVE COST MANDATES -- ON COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY TOSSES THAT CAREFULLY NEGOTIATED COMPROMISE ASIDE -- AND CHANGE THE RULES AFTER THE FACT AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU I DO ANY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION HERE MISTER MEMBERS BOATBUILDER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SAN BUT YOU KNOW ALSO NO. OPPOSITION. WHERE MISTER RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION THANK YOU? GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH HAS BEEN -- SOME BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. AUDREY RETIRED CHECK ON BEHALF OF SAN MATEO COUNTY -- AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND WE'RE SEEKING STATE FUNDING BECAUSE IT WOULD COST IN EXCESS OF A MILLION DOLLARS. THANK YOU. KAREN LAYING ON THE OF THE STANISLAUS COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS BENICIA **** ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF YOU BE DOING THIS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF THE ABOUT THE COST OF THIS AND THAT SOMETHING WE NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION I KNOW APPROPRIATIONS -- WILL BE LOOKING LONG AND HARD AT BUT AT THIS POINT THE QUESTION BEFORE US IS PUBLIC SAFETY AND YOU KNOW I THINK I AM. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE KNOW THAT. THIS KIND OF THING REDUCES RECIDIVISM AND THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL OF THIS COMMITTEE BECAUSE IT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER IT IMPROVES OUTCOMES. AND AND IN THE END TO REDUCE COSTS BECAUSE IT MEANS LESS PEOPLE ARE BEING HELD IN OUR PRISONS AND SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTED I LOOK. TO APPROPRIATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING. TO GIVE YOU WHAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK. I'M GOING TO MOVE THE BELL. ALL RIGHT SO. LOOK THIS IS OPPOSED NOT ONLY BY THE SHERIFF'S WHO. OFTEN OPPOSE THINGS BECAUSE OF COST BUT SAN MATTEO COUNTY IN THE URBAN COUNTIES. AND THEY'RE RIGHT THIS IS MUCH TOO COSTLY WITHOUT STATE AID. AGAIN I AGREE WITH -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- RIP. REBECCA BAUER-KAHAN -- THEN. A HUNDRED QUE HA. IT'S QUE HAN OKAY HAND SORRY QUE HAN. ALL RIGHT -- YOU KNOW IF YOUR KIDS END UP WITH FOR LAST NAMES THANK ABOUT EIGHT EIGHT I'M SORRYI'M SO I RESEMBLE THAT REMARK. MAY THEY HAVE SUCH PROBLEMS -- YES MAY THEY HAVE SAYS BROWN'S -- TALKING ABOUT BIRDS -- I WOULD SUGGEST MAKING THIS A TO YOUR BILL AND WORKING ON THE BUDGET PROCESS. BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT THIS JUST DIES AND APPROPRIATIONS -- THEY LOOK NOT ONLY AT ST COSTS BUT THEY ALSO LOOK AT LOCAL COSTS AND THIS IS JUST JYJ -- AND I HONESTLY THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR. AND I CERTAINLY ARE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE -- BUDGET CHAIRS. WOULD APPRECIATE -- THIS APPROACH. BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S GONNA -- BUDGET -- ASK IN THE BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS FOR THIS REALLY TO MAKE IT INTO LAW AGAIN I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT CONCEPT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY WOMAN WICKS THANK YOU -- THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE EASY TO USE USE THE WORD IN HUMANE WHICH I THINK IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS AND I THINK -- YOU KNOW THE WAY THAT WE REDUCE RECIDIVISM IS THAT FOLKS CAN GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE A FULL CONNECTION WITH THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR LOVED ONES AND SO I THINK THAT IS THE GOAL. DO YOU ALL HAVE A SENSE AND I GET THERE'S A COST COMPONENT NEEDS TO BE FIGURED OUT BUT WE DO HAVE TO RIGHT SOME WRONGS OF OUR PREDECESSORS IN TERMS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE. AND THERE ARE MANY -- DO YOU ALL HAVE A SENSE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE THIS ACTUALLY IMPACTS ON A DAY TO DAY. YES WE DO HAVE THE NUMBER OF FACILITIES THAT ONLY HAVE -- A VIDEO VISITS HANG ON ONE SECOND. FIND THAT NUMBER. IT IS FIFTEEN COUNTIES -- AND TWENTY TWO SEPARATE FACILITIES THAT ONLY ALLOW FOR VIDEO VISITS GOT IT OKAY SO SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE. YES YEAH OKAY I THINK I'LL DEFINITELY BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT [inaudible] OKAY NEAR. KAMLAGER-DOVE -- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I TO WILL BE -- SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK THE CONCEPT IS IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE FACT THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL. AFFIRMS FOR ME THAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT HOW WE REIMAGINE INCARCERATION IN THE KINDS OF FACILITIES IN WHICH WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE -- IT IS CERTAINLY OKAY AND I THINK IT IS ACCURATE FOR US TO COME BACK AND SAY WE MADE SOME MISTAKES AND WE HAVE TO GO ABOUT CORRECTING THEM. I ALSO THINK THAT WE NEED TO STOP THINKING IN BINARY PROPOSITIONS IN THIS BILL AFFORDS BOTH HANDS AS OPPOSED TO EITHER ORDERS. AND WHICH WASN'T MENTIONED IS YOU KNOW -- ONLY HAVING VIDEO CONFERENCING OR NOT ALLOWING IN PERSON ALSO IMPACTS THE ABILITY FOR FOLKS TO MEET WITH COUNSEL AND I CERTAINLY THINK WE NEED TO BE FINDING MORE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE THAT TO HAPPEN SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER MEDINA WELL FIRST OF ALL I I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR WHAT I THINK IS A VERY ENLIGHTENED -- CONVERSATION AND AS CHAIR OF A ANOTHER POLICY COMMITTEE I I RESPECT THE CONVERSATION THAT THAT WHAT WE SHOULD DO HEARING COMMITTEE IS TO TALK ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY. AND THEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD LET IS TALK ABOUT THE CLASS. I THANK YOU AB EIGHT NINE SIXTY FOUR WILL CERTAINLY HELP STRENGTHEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN -- INCARCERATED AND DETAIN PERSONS AND THEIR LOVED ONES BY ENSURING THAT VIDEO OF VISITATION IS ONLY A SUPPLEMENT AND NOT -- REPLACEMENT FOR IN PERSON VISITATION. I THANK MY WITNESSES HERE -- I THANK OF RABBI SINGER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO ME. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF AND YOU KNOW I I DON'T. CD ROM WITH THE WITH THE BAR CARE JONES SAWYER MERITS BUT THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER DISCUSSION -- THAT'S FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE MISS AS FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE. SO I I IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE ALWAYS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE AND SO I I ALSO SIT ON BUDGET SO. FIVE SO THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF CAN WE PAY FOR IT I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD VOICED. THESE COSTS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND SO I ON THE OTHER END OF THE SUPPORT OF GETTING YOU MONEY BUT ALSO WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU. TO RECONFIGURE OR TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO DO THE ADDITIONAL SPACE AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE OR AN EXPENSIVE HE GOING TO BE CHEAP BUT IT'S AN EXPENSIVE POSSIBLE AND THERE'S A WAY. TO DO IT WHERE IT DOESN'T BECOME COST PROHIBITIVE -- WE DOCTOR BY ADDITIONAL LAND AND ALL THAT SO I WOULD LOVE TO BE IN THAT DISCUSSION. IN THAT OTHER COMMITTEE -- THE THE PEOPLE THAT WE MET THAT ARE INCARCERATED ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME IS GETTING BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THOSE IN PERSON -- VISITATIONS ARE THE SOMETIMES THE ONLY LIFELINE TO THE OUTSIDE -- YOU YOU HEAR THEM. ONE IN MAY AFTER THE OTHER OVER AND OVER WILL SAY. I'M TRYING TO GET HOME TO MY FAMILY TO MY CHILDREN TO TO SOMEBODY ON THE OUTSIDE WHO'S DOING THE RIGHT THING. AND SO THAT'S WHY THESE THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO US AND WE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NOT ONLY MOVE IT FORWARD -- FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT BUT WE ALSO WORK WITH YOU SO WE DON'T BURDEN. THE COUNTIES THAT AT YOUR LEVEL AND SO THE SHARES RECOMMEND I WITH YOU KNOWING THAT. WILL WORK WITH YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T. COST YOU OUT OF EXISTENCE OKAY. ON A. B. NINE SIXTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. HI JOHN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NO BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE HI KAMLAGER-DOVE AYE QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS FIVE WEEKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU YOU. NOW WE HAVE MR MCCARTY WHO'S HERE. BUT CAME IN LAST BUT SINCE HE'S HERE HE GETS TO GO NEXT. BETTER BE LIKE OKAY CRISTINA GARCIA OBERNOLTE EGGMAN KILEY AND TING. MR MCCARTY JUST JUMPED IN FRONT OF YOU YOU NEED TO GET DOWN HERE THEY WERE HERE. YEAH SO WHAT'S BILLION ME TO GO FIRST MISTER CHAIR -- THE NUMERICAL ORDER I DON'T NUMBER ELEVEN NO ADAM NUMBER LOW YET ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE ITEM NUMBER TWENTY AND THEN YOU DO TWELVE NINETY SEVEN ITEM NUMBER. TWENTY FIVE THANK YOU -- I HAVE BEFORE ME AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE IT'S IS A BILL WHAT'S WILL CLARIFY THE ROLE OF A SHERIFF'S OVERSIGHT BOARD. AS WE KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A BOARD OF SUPERVISOR COUNTY BUT A SUPERVISING A SHERIFF IS UNIQUE. THEY'RE BOTH INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED -- THIS UNIQUE STRUCTURE HAS CAUSED SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS OF OVERSIGHT. OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAS LONG BEEN ESTABLISHED AND AS A RESULT IN POSITIVE CHANGES IN CITIES. LIKE SAN FRANCISCO SEATTLE NOW SACRAMENTO AT THE SAME CAN ALWAYS BE SAID WITH SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OVERSIGHT BOARDS HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF WE HAD A WELL PUBLICIZED CONFLICT. IN LAW BETWEEN OUR SHERIFF AND OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OVER THE ROLE OF OUR INSPECTOR GENERAL. LA IN OTHER VERY COUNTIES HAD OTHER CONFLICTS. IN THIS BILL ATTEMPT TO CLARIFY WHAT THESE BODIES CAN DO AND THE ISSUE TO IS IN SOME OF THESE JURISDICTIONS LIKE YOUR JURISDICTION LA IN SACRAMENTO. ON A CORPORATE AREAS WITH THE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT LITERALLY IS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. OVER ONE MILLION PEOPLE IN LA COUNTY AND OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- STATEWIDE 39% OF SWORN OFFICERS WORK FOR A COUNTY SHERIFF -- AS WE KNOW DISTRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IN COMMUNITIES IS AT ALL TIME HIGH IN TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT IS NEEDED -- THIS BILL WILL WILL CLARIFY AND CODIFY A COURT DECISION FOR THE NINETIES THAT SHERIFF OVERSIGHT BOARDS -- CAN BE ROBUST AND HAVE ENOUGH AUTHORITY AND ISSUE SUBPOENAS TO PROVIDE A TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION OVER THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. I WITH ME IS THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING LIZZY BEACON WITH THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS SPEECH AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE THIS BILL RATE OVERSIGHT BOARDS AND APPOINT INSPECTORS GENERAL TO OVERSEE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS. AND ALSO CLARIFIES THOSE OVERSIGHT ENTITIES CAN BE IN DOUBT A SUBPOENA POWER SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE MEANING FULLY PERFORM THAT OVERSIGHT. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT IF AN OVERSIGHT ENTITY IS CONDUCTING A PARALLEL INVESTIGATION THAT THAT INVESTIGATION SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS OBSTRUCTION AS IT OCCASIONALLY -- MISTAKENLY HAS BEEN CURRENTLY BECAUSE THIS IS NOT EXPLICIT IN THE STATUTE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAVE A STATUTORY DUTY TO SUPERVISE THE CONDUCT OF SHERIFF'S -- OFTEN DO NOT FEEL EMPOWERED TO ACTUALLY OBTAIN THE INFORMATION THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THAT SUPERVISION NOR DO THE OVERSIGHT ENTITIES -- THEY ESTABLISHED. SO IF YOU EXAMPLES FROM LOS ANGELES WHERE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION OVER WHETHER THE BOARD COULD GRANT OVERSIGHT TO ITS AS CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION -- THEY HAVE BEEN THE CEO SEE HAS BEEN TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE MANY PROBLEMS IN OUR COUNTY JAILS -- ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS ASKED FOR A RECORD OF COMPLAINTS FROM THE PEOPLE TO BE DETAINED IN THE JAIL THE SHERIFF REFUSED TO PRODUCE THAT RECORD. THE COMMISSION ALSO ASKED TO SEE THE POLICY ON INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO ARE BREAST FEEDING AGAIN THE SHERIFF REFUSED TO PROVIDE THAT TO THEM. MANY OF YOU MAY ALSO BE AWARE OF THE THE SO CALLED CLICKS OR WITHIN THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WHERE THE SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES REWARDED EACH OTHER AND ENCOURAGE EACH OTHER TO USE EXCESSIVE FORCE AND TO SHOOT PEOPLE -- THE COMMISSION REQUESTED DOCUMENTS REFLECTING LA ESTEVES MANAGEMENT ALLEY ESTY MANAGEMENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF AND INTENDS TO ADDRESS THESE CLICKS AFTER A VERY LONG DELAY LA ESTY PRODUCED A SINGLE NON RESPONSIVE REPORT. THAT WAS MERELY ABOUT STREET GANGS WAS NOT ABOUT THAT THE GANGS WITHIN THE LA SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT DEPUTIES -- AND THEN OF COURSE RIGHT HERE AND SACRAMENTO SHARE OF JONES LOCKED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OUT OF THE ALL SHARES FACILITIES BECAUSE ODD BECAUSE INSPECTOR GENERAL HAD RELEASED A REPORT THAT WAS CRITICAL OF ONE OF THE HOMICIDES BY THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT -- THERE WAS CONFUSION BY THE BOY ABOUT WHAT IF ANYTHING THEY COULD DO ABOUT THIS -- ENSURE OF JONES DID NOT HELP BY MAKING A SERIES OF PREPOSTEROUS COMMENTS TO THE PRESS AND IN AND BEFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHERE HE CLEARLY DID NOT UNDERSTAND CURRENT LAW -- HE THOUGHT HE WAS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OVERSIGHT WHATSOEVER SO. SHERIFFS. ARE NOT ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELFARE OF ABOUT 700-007-5000 INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN OUR JAILS BUT THEY ALSO PATROLLER FOR OUR STREETS THEY USE FORCE THEY SOMETIMES USE DEADLY FORCE. ON AND BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO THIS SUPERVISE THEIR CONDUCT. BUT THE OVERSIGHT BODIES THAT THEY ARE CREATING I INCLUDING CIVILIAN REVIEW BOARDS AND INSPECTORS GENERAL CANNOT FULFILL THEIR MISSION -- IN A MEANINGFUL MANNER WITHOUT TIMELY AND COMPLETE ACCESS TO ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION THIS DOES NOT FORCE BOARDS TO DO ANYTHING THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO IT MAKES THEIR AUTHORITY CLEAR SO REMOVES ANY BARRIERS THAT THEY MIGHT. BE SAYING. THE OPPOSITION -- SAYS IN HIS LETTER THAT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY LAW -- WERE MERELY TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT LAW AND IT'S CLEAR FROM THE SITUATION IN SACRAMENTO AND THE LOS ANGELES THAT CLARIFICATION IS NECESSARY -- BOAT WE AGREE THIS ISN'T BREAKING NEW GROUND THIS WON'T RESULT IN OVER REACH -- WERE TRIP TRYING TO MERELY MAKE IT CLEAR THAT BOARDS CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. SEVEN WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR SIGNAL SIR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION OF CORAL OFFENSE ATTORNEYS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ALSO WORKING PUBLIC DEFENDEROFFICES WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT. JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- WHAT WE'VE SEEN -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS AN ON GOING ON ON LONG TERM FIGHT -- IN VARIETY OF JURISDICTIONS OVER THIS ISSUE -- I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IT I KNOW MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION BEEN INVOLVED WITH THESE FIGHTS. AND TYPICALLY IT COMES DOWN TO YOU KNOW REALLY TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME SOME TRUST AND SOME ACCOUNTABILITY -- SO THAT THE PUBLIC HAS CONFIDENCE -- WHEN THERE ARE YOU KNOW USES OF EXCESSIVE FORCE OF DEADLY FORCE? ARE THEY NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED THE PUBLIC HAS TO FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THERE IS AN INDEPENDENT BODY LOOKING AT THIS AND THAT THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REALLY DELVE INTO THE ISSUES -- TOO OFTEN OTHER BEEN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE CREATED BODIES A DON'T HAVE SUBPOENA POWER DON'T HAVE -- THE ABILITY TO REALLY GET INTO THE ISSUES AND BRING WITNESSES AND GATHER INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED BY THE PRIOR WITNESS. IN AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN THE DECISION IS MADE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PROSECUTE -- AN OFFICER CORD SURE STEP IN THIS INSTANCE -- THE V. PUBLIC LOSES CONFIDENCE WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THE SUPPOSEDLY INDEPENDENT BODY LACKS THIS SUBPOENA POWER LACKS THE ABILITY REALLY INVESTIGATE. THE ISSUE SO REALLY THIS IS ABOUT LAYING OUT SOME GROUNDWORK THAT IF A COUNTY DECIDES TO GO. THIS DIRECTION THAT THERE'S LEAST A GOOD FRAMEWORK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ESTABLISHING MADE CLEAR WHERE THE COUNTIES CAN GO AND SHOULD GO. AND I THINK THAT WILL HELP THE DEBATES -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE ALWAYS DEBATES HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS AND EVEN WITH THIS BILL IT WILL REMAIN HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS BUT AT THE VERY LEAST. WE'LL HAVE SOME CLARITY AND CERTAINTY AS TO WHAT THE AUTHORITY IS OF COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND A DIRECTION THAT THEY CAN GO TO HELP RESOLVE THIS ISSUE FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MARCO GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES OPPOSITION COR. MORE MATURE MEMBERS COURSE THOSE A LITTLE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY -- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- WE GOT A SNEAK PREVIEW FROM -- THE PROPONENTS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY SEVERAL COUNTIES HAVE ALREADY -- UNDERTAKEN THE TYPES OF ADOPTION OF OVERSIGHT THE BILL CONTEMPLATES WHETHER IN THE FORM OF A CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT BOARD OR AN INSPECTOR GENERAL -- TO THE QUESTION OF SUBPOENA POWER COUNTY COUNCILS HAVE SUBPOENA POWER. GRAND JURIES HAVE SUBPOENA POWER IF THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION THE NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. IF IT'S A CRIMINAL MATTER DISTRICT ATTORNEY HAS SUBPOENA POWER SO THE NOTION THAT NOBODY CAN COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS OR TESTIMONY OR WITNESSES -- IS IS I THINK IN CORRECT AND AND FRANKLY THE ANALYSIS POINT SOUTHERLY SOMEBODY IN A ENTITIES -- AT ISSUE HERE ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO BE GIVEN THAT SUBPOENA POWER LOCALLY AND SO -- WE ARE OBJECTION IS TO PUTTING THIS EXPRESS OF FORTY AND STATURE WHEN IT ALREADY EXISTS -- IT'S GOING TO CREATE UNDUE PRESSURE ON COUNTY GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE THIS TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP -- WHERE IT IS SPECIALLY COUNTIES WHERE THERE ISN'T A PERCEIVED ISSUE BUT COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE EXPECTED OR PRESSURED TO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF OVERSIGHT -- ONE IS NOT DEEMED NECESSARY BY THE BOARD BUT THEY'RE SUCCUMBING TO POLITICAL PRESSURES AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR LACKEY MISS COME LOOK AT THE REST QUIRK IN [inaudible] OKAY OKAY. THE FIRST OF ALL I WOULD THE I WOULD SAY CERTAINLY -- PUBLIC TRUST TO SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOWARD. TOWARD BUILDING -- AND IN MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE. BUT THEY'RE ALSO MANY PARTS OF OUR STATE WERE. THE PUBLIC TRUST IS VERY SOUND. AND I THINK THAT -- USING THIS KIND OF AS A STATE MANDATE IS NOT ONLY UNNECESSARY. BUT I THINK IN MANY ASPECTS. IT DISREGARDS THE VOICE VOICE TO THE VOTERS BECAUSE THE VOTERS ACTUALLY SELECTION ERRORS. AND I I THINK THAT. MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER IT AN OVERSIGHT BOARD FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THAT MANAGING THOUGHT MAYBE WE SHOULD DO THAT. THAT'S ALL I GOT. COME UNDER THE Q. I WAS WONDERING I HAVE -- TWO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS HOW WOULD THIS OVERSIGHT BOARD WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS AND ALSO WITH -- DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES I'M ASKING BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW IF THERE WOULD BE SOME AUTHORITY OVER LAST. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION IS HOW WOULD THIS BOARD -- BE DIFFERENT FROM -- SHERIFF OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE HAVE AGE -- LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SO IF YOU COULD JUST SORT OF SHARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WHAT THE BOARD. WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY OVER AND WHAT THE COMMISSION WOULD HAVE AUTHORITY OF CHERYL ALL START IN TURN OVER TO OUR WITNESS SO IT WOULDN'T CREATE ANY NEW ENTITY JUST CLARIFY WHAT THEY CAN DO. FOR EXAMPLE IN IN LA THEY WEREN'T ALWAYS GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT THEY WERE REQUESTING SO THIS WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF SUBPOENA. POWER TO GET THE INFORMATION HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAD ENTITY. AND THERE IT'S ESSENTIALLY SHUT OUT. BY OUR LOCAL SHERIFF BECAUSE YOU DON'T REALLY LIKE THE OVERSIGHT AND OUR COUNTY COUNCIL ISSUED A MEMO WHICH WAS -- MUDDY IS IS A NICE DEFINITION. AND THAT WAS THE IMPETUS FOR COMING HERE TO HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS WHAT THESE ENTITIES CAN DO AS FAR AS LOCAL DA'S -- YOU KNOW THEY THERE WILL IF THERE'S EVER AN ISSUE AN INVESTIGATION THAT WILL GO ON THERE. I CAN CURRENT PATH INDEPENDENT AND WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THEIR ON THEIR LINE OF WORK. YEAH AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT -- THIS SAID THE THE BOARD WOULD BE APPOINTING THESE COMMISSIONS AS THEY DID THE CIVILIAN OVERSIGHT COMMISSION IN LOS ANGELES AND SO WE ARE TALKING ABOUT -- CIVIL REVIEW BOARDS OR COMMISSIONS LIKE THE C. O. C. IN LA -- OR INSPECTOR GENERAL SO THOSE ARE -- THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. SO GRANTING MORE AUTHORITY TO EXISTING ONES OR CREATING OPPORTUNITY FOR ONCE TO BE DEVELOPED IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE RIGHT AND AND THAT OPPORTUNITY DOES EXIST THEY THEY CERTAINLY CAN INPUT APPOINT. THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEANINGFULLY PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU OF FIFTY FOUR I THINK THEY'RE TOO MANY COUNTY ELECTED OFFICES -- I WOULD BE QUITE HAPPY IF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WAS THE ONLY ELECTED OFFICE IN THE COUNTY. WHEN YOU HAVE AN ASSESSOR AND SHERIFF IN THE REST OF IT? IT JUST SPREADS OUT AUTHORITY IN SUCH A WAY YOU'RE NEVER QUITE SURE WHO TO GO. TO HOWEVER I'M NOT PLANNING TO PUT UP CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE. SO WE'RE LEFT WITH SPLIT THE STORY. SHERIFF SAYING -- YOU CAN'T TELL ME TO DO THIS -- THE COUNTY AT LEAST IN MY COUNTY REALLY DEPENDS UPON THE BUDGET -- TO IT TO INFLUENCE WHAT THE SHERIFF DOES HE WILL COMPLAIN GREATLY IN THE PAPERS ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IT'S JUST A MESS BUT ANYWAY. GETTING BACK TO THAT I DO SUPPORT. ON OVERSIGHT BOARD HAVING SUBPOENA POWER MY MAIN CONCERN PARTICULARLY FOR GENERAL LAW COUNTY SAID TEND TO BE SMALL -- AND WOULD LIKELY TO HAVE A COMMITTEE THAT'S NOT WELL STAFFED MY CONCERN IS JUST HAVING A GROUP OF CIVILIANS. VOTE TO HAVE A SUBPOENA AND THEN THAT BE ISSUED WITHOUT -- BACK UP FROM SAY COUNTY COUNCIL. AND I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IS YOUR BILL GOES FORWARD -- TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO ISSUE A SUBPOENA AND IT'S ANOTHER THING FOR IT -- TOO FOR A JUDGE TO SUPPORT IT. I THINK THAT YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING IN THIS BILL. THAT REQUIRES THAT THIS GO THROUGH. THE COUTY COUNCIL OFFICE MUCH LIKE WE GO THROUGH SAY -- TO HAVE OUR LEGISLATION LOOKED AT BY LEDGE COUNCIL -- BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'M WORRIED YOU'RE GONNA GET SUBPOENAS WHICH MIGHT NOT HOLD UP IN COURT -- SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADDITION TO YOUR BILL. AND IF YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT I'M CERTAINLY GLAD TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. WE WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD SUGGESTION AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE SMALL CITIES THAT HAVE -- THESE OVERSIGHT BODIES AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT HAVING THE STAFFING AND OVERSIGHT SO I WHEN WHEN IT. JUST THAT DISMISS AT A SMALLER COUNTY THAT HAS THIS ENTITY BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT CERTAINLY WILL CONSIDER GOING. FOR OKAY THANK YOU THEN I MOVED TO BAIL OUT. YES MISS WORKS. SO I THINK YOU KNOW MOST PEOPLE AGREE SUCCESSFUL POLICING IS BUILT ON TRUST ANYTHING CAN FAR TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT TRUST IS LOST -- AND I THINK OVERSIGHT OF SHERIFF IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO REALLY ENHANCING -- PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITIES -- ALL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT JUST TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK ON AS A MEMBER AT COME WATER DIVES. QUESTION SO IS IT THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED SIR THAT SOME CAN MANY COUNTIES ALREADY HAVE AN OVERSIGHT BOARD. THAT WOULD THEN MEAN THAT MANY COUNTIES DON'T I ASSUME SO WITH THIS THIS WOULD CREATE KIND OF LIKE A FLOOR. AND IF COUNTIES HAVE KIND OF MORE AGGRESSIVE OVERSIGHT THEY COULD STILL IT HERE TO THAT BUT IT CREATES A FLOOR FOR THE STATE SO THAT ALL. SHERIFF'S OFFICES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IS THAT KIND OF WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. I'M SO ACT ACTUALLY NO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY ANY COUNTIES COULD TO CREATE AN OVERSIGHT BOARD -- ALL BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS ARE REQUIRED TO OVERSEE AND THEIR SHARE THE CONDUCT OF THEIR SHARES -- BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM TO CREATE AND AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY IT WILL IT JUST MERELY. LARA FIGHTS THAT THEY CAN DO SO AND THAT THOSE ENTITIES. THANK YOU AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTED THAT SOME COUNTIES ARE DONE THIS THROUGH THE ELECTORATE SOME OF THAN THIS TO THE COUNTY OARD OF SUPERVISORS AND THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION AS FAR AS WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO AND SO -- THIS WOULD WOULD CLARIFY AND CODIFY WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED MCCARTY. YEAH I THINK THIS IS A A NECESSARY STEP BY I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION FROM OUR SERVICE ASSOCIATION BUT ONE THING THAT THEY SAID IT'S IT'S UNNECESSARY THE ARE YOU CAN DO IT SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE PROBLEM. OF CODIFYING WHAT THEY CAN DO AS A WHOLE AND ALSO THE NOTION OF OTHERS -- YOU KNOW OVERSIGHT IS A BAD THING WE ALL KNOW THAT SUNSHINE IS THE BEST DISINFECTANT. AND HAVING MORE ENTITIES GOING AND LOOKING AT THESE ENTITIES -- CAN BRING ABOUT MORE PUBLIC TRUST WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR POLICING PRACTICES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND BEYOND ASK THE RIGHT THOUGH. THANK YOU END UP. WITH SOMEONE THAT FROM LA COUNTY -- SOMEONE THAT MY MAYBE I SHOULD BE THE ONLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AT THAT ENDORSED THE PRESIDENT'S CHAIR RIGHT NOW. AND I PROBABLY GET MORE CALLS AND EVER WANTED TO IN MY LIFE -- BUT I'VE ALSO HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SHERIFF THAT WE HAVE NOW. THEN THE DISCUSSION I HAD BEFORE IN DISCUSSION I'M HAVING NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO HAVING GUIDELINES VERY IMPORTANT. EVEN NOW THERE'S THERE'S EVEN A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SHERIFF CAN HIRE WHO WE ONCE AND FOR FIRE WE WANT SO WHO CAN FIRE THAT PERSON AND WE DO NEEDS SOME SOME CLARITY. ON THAT -- ESPECIALLY SINCE EVERYONE SEEMS TO BE AN ELECTED OFFICIAL. OF THE THE WORST THING WE COULD HAVE RIGHT NOW AND IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH MAY HAPPEN IS A RECALL WHICH CALLS EVEN MOVE FURTHER. CONFUSION BECAUSE THE BOARD DOESN'T LIKE TO SHARE OF DOING AND VICE VERSA AND SO I I APPLAUD YOU ON TRYING. TO FIND EACH DIFFERENT AREA SO THAT -- AT LEAST PEOPLE KNOW FROM OF FLOOR WHAT IS EXPECTED FROM FROM EACH ENTITY AND THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING AND AND I BECAUSE WE WE I KNOW IN LA COUNTY WE DEFINITELY NEED SOME HELP. I AB ELEVEN EIGHTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER OPTIONS ARE I LACKEY. LACKEY NELL BARRICADE HAND. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS FIVE WEEKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU. AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE MISTER MCCARTY. ZERO TWELVE NINETY SEVEN OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANKS FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN RELATED TO CONCEALED WEAPON PERMITS AND THE FINANCING OF I KNOW THIS IS THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE BUT LITERALLY THIS BILL. SHOULD BE HEARD AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND IT'S IT'S A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCING ISSUE IT'S NOT A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT WHO CAN APPLY FOR IS THE C. W.'S ON ABOUT THE REQUIREMENTS ON ABOUT WHO CAN ISSUE THEM. OR ANY SUBSTANCE JAMES IS THE LAW IT'S SIMPLY INSURES THAT FEES CHARGED BY A SHARE FOR POLICE FOR ISSUING A CCW. ADEQUATELY COVER THE COST LIKE WHEN YOU GO AND GET A MARRIAGE LICENSE A BUILDING PERMIT IT SHOULD BE BORNE UPON THE USER YEAH GETTING THAT PERMITS. AND SO THIS IS REALLY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUE HERE IN SACRAMENTO -- WE'VE HAD THIS IS YOUR LAST FEW YEARS EVERY YEAR -- WE HAVE TO DIP IN THE COUNTY BUDGET BY ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND HALF A MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF INADEQUATE FEES. FOR OUR C. C. W.'S WE HAD THIS DEBATE TWO YEARS AGO. WE ASK THAT THE STATE AUDITOR LOOKING IN THIS ISSUE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ON TO SOMETHING THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED -- SHE DID SOME WORK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND REVIEWED CEASE W. POLICIES IN THE COUNTIES OF SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO AND LA. AND FOUND THAT BESIDES COST OVER RUNS -- SOME COUNTIES COULDN'T EVEN ACCOUNT OF THE THAT THEY CHARGE TOO MUCH OR NOT ENOUGH. A FURTHER ARE EXAMPLES OF SHERIFFS AND IT ENTITIES NOT BEING ABLE TO DO OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE WAS THE CW'S -- ARE ARE WARRANTED. I THIS IS A FRIGHTENING STORY BUT RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE CAPITOL HERE FIVE YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH THE CCW WHO WAS HOLED UP IN THE HIGH IT. WITH AN ARSENAL OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION AND HE WANTED TO DO HARM TO GOVERNMENT AND THAT WAS THE SOLE ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY MENTALLY UNSTABLE LAW ENFORCEMENT ABLE TO TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE THE HOUSEKEEPING STAFF ALERTED. THE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WENT TO GO FIND ITS INDIVIDUAL AND BROUGHT HIM BACK AND WERE ABLE TO TAKE CARE THE SITUATION. BUT IT JUST SHOWS THAT SOMETIMES INDIVIDUALS WHO GETS THE C. W.'S AREN'T PROPERLY THAT IT DOES NOT AND IF SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT IN LARGE PART BECAUSE WE DON'T CHARGE ADEQUATE FEES. AT THIS WILL HELP MAKE SURE THAT -- WE DO THAT AND MAKE SURE THE TAXPAYERS A GENERAL FUND TAXPAYERS AREN'T SUBSIDIZING THE ISSUANCE OF CCW PERMITS I WITH ME HERE TODAY OUR REPRESENT HIM FOR A SUPERVISOR PATRICK KENNEDY. AND AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS THE SETTLEMENT MENTION I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY SUPERVISOR PATRICK KENNEDY AND GOING TO READ A BRIEF STATEMENT FROM HIM. DEAR CHAIR JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS ISSUE. I AM FIRMLY SUPPORTIVE OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE NINETY SEVEN MY SUPPORT IS NOT BASED ON MY FEELINGS ABOUT GUNS ARE CONCEALED CARRY WEAPONS PERMITS THEMSELVES FROM THE FISCAL IMPACT THIS HAS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. DO THE FACT THE CURRENT LAW PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE ON HOW MUCH TO CHARGE FOR AN APPLICATION FEE THOSE ISSUING CCW PERMITS ARE ALLOWED TO CHARGE FEES THAT ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR COVERING THE COST. OF ISSUING OVERSEEING THE PERMITS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY THIS COST APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO FUND THE LAST FISCAL YEAR WE HAVE DATA. FOR AS I'M SURE YOU ARE WELL AWARE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE STILL NOT RECOVERED FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND ARE STRUGGLING WITH A NUMBER OF PRESSING ISSUES SUCH AS HOMELESSNESS. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AN AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. IT SHOULD BE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PRIORITY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE ISSUES RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZE THOSE WHO WISH TO OBTAIN A CCW PERMIT. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. YES. AMANDA WILCOX WITH BRADY CALIFORNIA A MANY OF OUR CHAPTER MEMBERS AND IN PARTICULAR ARE SACRAMENTO CHAPTER -- FIND IT VERY TROUBLING THAT AND JURISDICTIONS. WHERE THE FEE FOR CCW LICENSES NOT COVER THE COSTS THE FUNDS ARE DIVERTED FROM OTHER LOCAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN A JURISDICTION? AND THOSE ARE DIVERTED FUNDS ARE SUBSIDIZING. THE ISSUANCE ENFORCEMENT OF CCW PERMITS. NO SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF PROP. THIRTEEN WHEN WAS THAT. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA HAS OVER TIME ADOPTED A FEE FOR SERVICE RECEIVE MODEL AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF BASIC SERVICES AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTION OF FEES LEVIED ON ALMOST EVERYTHING. AND WE DO NOT SEE WHY CARRYING A LOADED HITTING GUN WHICH IS A PRIVILEGE NOT A RIGHT. OF WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME STANDARD IN PARTICULAR WHAT WE FIND DISTURBING IS UNDER CURRENT LAW THERE'S A MAXIMUM FEE THAT CAN BE CHARGE OF HUNDRED DOLLARS. DOES NOT WHICH DOES NOT COVER THE COST AND IT'S NOT JUST ISSUING THE PERMIT. BUT AGAIN THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT THAT PERMANENT -- SO WE SUPPORT THIS BILL NATURAL URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ME WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DâN RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION -- HERE IN OPPOSITION YOU YOU HEARD -- FROM. THIS WOMAN MCCARTY THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE AND AND I THINK THAT IT STEMS FROM THAT -- YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THERE'S NO LAW ENFORCEMENT HERE THE ISSUING AUTHORITIES HERE REQUESTING THIS BILL TODAY -- THERE ARE PARAMETERS IN LAW THAT LAY OUT -- THE EXISTING CCW PERMIT SCHEME AND HOW IT CAN BE INCREASED UNDER THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX -- I THINK THERE'S SOME ISSUES WITH -- LATEST BILLS WRITTEN -- DIMENSIONS ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S VERY VAGUE WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES THAT MEAN. JUST PUTTING IN -- INTO PLACE THE LICENSES I MEAN -- REVOKING LICENSE OR DOES THAT MEAN. ANYTHING COULD THIS BE USED TO BE DISCRIMINATORY TO PRICE PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKET OF BEING ABLE. TO APPLY FOR AND GET A CCW I THINK THAT -- THE THE EASIEST THING IN THE MOST LOGICAL THING IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT COSTS IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT IS WHAT BOXES DOWN. LET'S LOOK AT EXTENDING THE PERMIT OUT TO FOUR YEARS LET'S DOUBLE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY -- CUT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN HALF WE KNOW THE CCW HOLDERS ARE ARE VETTED -- WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS THERE'S TRAINING REQUIREMENTS THERE'S A LIVE SCANNED THERE'S A LOT OF PROCESS TO GO THROUGH IT AND RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE SHORTEST THE RATIONS FOR CCW PERMITS IN THE COUNTRY MOST STATES. HAVE PERMITS THERE FOR FIVE YEARS. THESE ARE ARE THE MOST LAW ABIDING CITIZENS OUT THERE AND THEY'RE CONSTANTLY MONITOR IN THESE PERMITS A REVOKED IF THERE'S ANY SORT OF DISQUALIFIER THAT. UP SO LET LET'S EXPLORE THAT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT -- APPROACH TO REDUCE THESE COSTS BY LOOKING AT A FOUR FIVE YEAR PERMIT WHICH IS WORKING GREAT AND OTHER PLACES IN THE COUNTRY WITH THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK CHAIRMAN MEMBER SAMPRAS REPRESENT GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA AND AS THE GOVERNOR A STATED IN HIS VETO MESSAGE OF THE PRIOR BILL. THAT THIS THIS IS -- COME UP AS A A BASICALLY A LOCAL COUNTY BEEF BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY MEN AND AND AND THE ELECTED SHERIFF -- THE AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN THE CCW PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS WORKING. YOUR WORDS IS WORKING FINE IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S WORKING -- IT'S DOING A GOOD JOB. NOW. EVERY SHERIFF EVERY CHIEF OF POLICE THAT ISSUES A CCW HAS TO DO THE SAME THING THEY HAVE TO CONDUCT. THE SAME BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- THEY HAVE TO CHECK THE THIS IS THE ONLY THING OTHER THAN FARMS THAT CAN BE USED TO PAYING THE FEDERAL NICS SYSTEM THE NATIONAL CRIMINAL. IN A INFORMATION SYSTEM -- AND AND ALL OF THE LOCAL AND STATE DATABASES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH WITH THE YOU KNOW THEM. ON A PERSON'S ABILITY TO TO TO GET A GUN IT IS. AS WAS POINTED OUT TO ME BY A FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE FARMS BUREAU. THE MOST EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECK THAT THE TAKES PLACE NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF OF COUNTIES. THEY DO IT WITH A HUNDRED DOLLARS OR LESS AS A MATTER OF FACT THE HUNDRED DOLLARS HIS GUMS. IS A IS A AN ENCOURAGEMENT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO TO TO HAVE A STREAMLINED SYSTEM THAT WORKS. AND THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING. IT'S WORKING. THE WE WE ARE NOT HAVING ISSUES. AND IT IS NOT A MAJORITY OR EVEN. BUT MAYBE A HANDFUL OF COUNTIES THAT ARE SPENDING ACTUALLY MORE THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND IN TALKING WITH SOME OF THE SHERIFF'S. THEY THEY THEY MIGHT SPEND A LITTLE MORE THAN AND THEY STILL TAKE SOME OF THE THE BUDGET THAT THEY ONSPENT DID NOT SPEND THE RETURN IT BACK TO THE COUNTY -- SO THEY'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF BALANCING EVERYTHING THE LEGISLATURE DOES THIS ALL THE TIME BALANCE IS THESE FUNDS THAT FUNDS THEY BORROW FROM YOUR TO USE YOUR WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT. DRAWS FUNDS ARE ARE BORROWED TO TO TO DO THINGS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH WITH THE THE DROSS ACTIVITIES AND AND ON AND ON AND ON THIS BILL IS TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND AND AND WE YOU KNOW WE FIND AT THAT -- WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL AGREE AND BOTH THIS BILL DOWN THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. WHEN STRUCTURE MEMBERS CHARLES HARVEY ON BEHALF OF LEAGUE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS BILL BUT A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS CITIES I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT -- THE MANDATE -- PRESCRIBING THIS BILL ON THE FLIP SIDE WE APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- PROPOSED CHANGE TO REMOVE THE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR CAP ON FEES FOR CITIES RECOUP THEIR REASONABLE COSTS OF ISSUING THE CCW PERMITS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROY GRIFFITH ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION WE STAND OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. DEMOCRATS STRONGLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S PERFECT BUT THEN AGAIN NO BILL EVER IS -- SO HERE MY CONCERNS -- IF YOU LIFT THE LIMIT ALTOGETHER THERE COULD BE A COUNTY SAY IN OUR IT'S GOING TO BE A THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A BACKBOARD. AS A BACKROOM WAY TO JUST PREVENT C. C. W.'S. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH LIFTING THE LIMIT FROM A HUNDRED TO TWO FIFTY AND THEN ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION -- I DO THINK THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN UPPER LIMIT -- WE HAVE THE SECOND AMENDMENT WELL I DON'T AGREE WITH IT WE HAVE IT AM I AND I JUST THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME SORT OF THE LIMIT -- IF. THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IS CAN I'M CONCERNED ALSO -- IS IT THE COUNTY OR THE SHERIFF THAT SETS THE FEE. FOR THE CC W.. WELL IT'S BASED UPON STATE LAW OF COURSE WITH THAT THE MAXIMAL OUT AND THEN THERE'S THAT THE AT THE BACKGROUND CHECK FOR THE PERMIT JUSTICE -- AND ITS THE IT'S THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S WHO ARE USUALLY THE OVERSEERS NOT NOT CITIES YEAH BUT THE TYPICALLY PROCESS WHAT THE FEE SHOULD BE IT'S A MAX OF A HUNDRED IT CAN BE LAST. WHO DECIDES WHAT THAT FEE IS WHETHER IT'S SAID AT THE MAX IS IT? SAID AT ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY DOLLARS WHO -- SETS THAT NUMBER I THINK IT VARIES. SHE I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CHAIR OF ANY. IT IS THE SHERIFF. ALL RIGHT WELL THEN I UNDERSTAND MORE YOUR BILL -- I STILL THINK THERE SHOULD BE A LIMIT -- APPROPRIATE WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE TWO FIFTY WITH SAID COLLATION ADJUSTER. AGAIN I JUST I THINK WE WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT. BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND ALSO WHITES THE SHERIFF. IF IT'S A SURE IF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS I THINK THEY CAN WORRY ABOUT THEIR OWN. BUDGET BUT IF IT IS THE SHERIFFS AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT THE CAR SHOULD BE RECOVERED. YES AND AND THANK YOU IT'S COMING BACK TO ME NOW ARE NO GOOD ANY SUPERVISORS NOT HERE AND HE WOULD REMIND ME THAT LAST YEAR THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ATTEMPTED TO ADJUST THE FEE AND THEY COULD NOT BECAUSE IT WAS SET. BY THE SHARE WHICH IS WHY. THEY ARE THE WITNESS TALKED ABOUT HOW SOME COUNTY THAT'S NOT AN ISSUE WILL IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. THIS THIS THIS PAST YEAR IS A FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR DEBT OTHER GENERAL FUND TO SUBSIDIZE THIS AND THAT'S YOU COULD USE THAT MONEY TO HIRE THREE MORE. SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES PATROLLING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SIR OUR OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND SO THE IT DICK THE THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHO HAD WHO WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S FULL RECOVERY. HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED YEAH AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOMETHING AROUND TWO HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS -- WOULD BE WHAT DOES SACRAMENTO NEEDS TO RECOVER. FOR ODD THAT AND I JUST DON'T WANT IT TO GO TO MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMATE ISSUE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE THESE FEES AT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS RIGHT -- SO THAT'S AN EX AND ACCESSIBLE ONLY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY WEALTHY BUT EVERYTHING IS NOT JUST -- THE FEES IT'S MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS. OUR OUR YOU KNOW OUR APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THESE IN -- ABSOLUTELY AND SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACT AS WELL I TOLD YOU ABOUT THE INSANE STORY OF AN INDIVIDUAL. THERE'S ANOTHER MAN WHO WENT DROVE TO ADD A CCW DROVE TO THE LOCAL NIGHTCLUB IN SAN FRANCISCO SHOT A GUY RIGHT AND HEAD IN THE STREET. ANOTHER GUY WHO WAS SELLING DRUGS AND WEAPONS ONLINE ON CRAIG'S LIST HERE IN SACRAMENTO SO THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO SLIPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS MAJORITY PEOPLE PROBABLY ARE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THIS. RARE PRIVILEGE TO HAVE A CONCEALED WEAPON ARE ARE ARE SAFE AND ARE ON OUR AT THE LEGITIMATE USE OF THIS -- OF THIS -- EXCEPTION OKAY MOVE THE BELL [inaudible] WOULD. YES MISS COME LATER YEAH SO I ALSO HAVE A QUESTION I ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF MISTER QUIRK AYE TO AGREE WITH YOU I THINK THIS IS A FEW CONVERSATION AND NOT A POLICY CONVERSATION I MEAN ANECDOTES. ARE -- DISTURBING BUT THIS BILL DEALS WITH -- FEES AND SO. AN EIGHT CAN YOU EXPAND ON IF THIS IS KIND OF AN END RUN AROUND ROGUE SHARE OF DEPARTMENTS -- WHO ARE NOT MAYBE DOING WHAT? THEY SHOULD BE DOING AND THEN HOW ARE WE DEFINING REASONABLE COST AND WHY NOT LOOK AT THE ACTUAL COST VERSES REASONABLE I'M AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THAT IS DEFINED IN IN A WAY THAT. IS REASONABLE. WELL OUT I THINK ALL AND TO THE SECOND POINT FIRST. WE WE LOOK AT THE SAME ISSUES TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS AGO MAYBE ON THAT SIDE. ACTUAL COSTS AND HAVING A CAPTAIN SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THIS TO MAKE SURE THE FOCUS OF THIS IS NOT TO SET THE MATTER PRICE. PRICE ALLOWED BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IT'S THAT COST RECOVERY. LIKE MOST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND SERVICES ARE DAIS. AND WE ASK THE STATE AUDITOR TO LOOK AT THREE COUNTIES COUPLE YEARS AGO THEY LOOKED AT LA COUNTY SAN DIEGO IN SACRAMENTO AND THEY CAME BACK. SAYING IT WASN'T JUST A LOCAL AS SHE WASN'T THE BEEF BETWEEN SACRAMENTO. AND ADVOCATES WHO WANTED TO MAKE SURE THIS IS COVERED THIS WAS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM WE DIDN'T HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS THERE WAS. THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR RECOVERY AND SOME OF THE SHERIFF'S CAME BACK AND SAID WE CAN'T WE LIKE TO CHARGE MORE BUT OUR HANDS ARE TIED A LITTLE BIT SO I THINK THIS IS -- CLARIFIES -- WHAT THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT SHOULD BE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ADEQUATE COST RECOVERY? BUT WE WILL I THINK TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. BOTH THE SUGGESTION FROM YOU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE TIED IT DOWN TO THE THAT NUMBER IS ACCURATE. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE WHEN I ALSO HEAR COST RECOVERY IT REMINDS ME OF THE CONVERSATION COUNTIES WERE HAVING AROUND US CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE. AND THEY WERE TAKING FOLKS AS PROPERTY BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST WENT THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING. BUT THAT YOU'RE CLOSE. ASK FOR YOUR EITHER THANK YOU THANK YOU BUT CHECK HER TEARS WRECKING I HAVE SAME CONCERNS AS SOMEONE WHO HELPED. ENACT THE CANNABIS LAWS. WHERE WE NOW HAVE -- MOST OF THE CAMERAS PEOPLE SHOUTING AND SCREAMING THE GOVERNMENT'S CHARGING HIM TOO MUCH MONEY -- WE GOT TO BE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT COST RECOVERY. ESPECIALLY WHEN. GOVERNOR EACH INDIVIDUAL ENTITY -- MAY ACTUALLY GO TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THEIR COST RECOVERY IN YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN FIND OUT HOW TO GET THAT HIGHWAY ANOTHER COUNTY THE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIFTY SO WE SHOULD BE YOU GOT A LOOK AT MAKING SURE WE DON'T HAVE ANY. ROGUE GROUPS -- FOR ME SO I'M NOT TOTALLY APRIL JUST WAS NOT A BUDGET ISSUE DISS FOR ME THIS IS A BINDING PEAS KIND OF ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO TO TO SET. A NUMBER AND THAT'S A POLICY ISSUE WHERE THEY CAN SET THAT NUMBERS OF CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND I AB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. TO ANSWER I LACKEY [inaudible] BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS. WICKS I THAT MEASURE ON CALL WITH SOME MEMBERS AT OTHER COMMITTEES MAKING PRESENTATIONS SO THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE MISTER STONE. MUST BE FINISHED. WITH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WE DID WE GOT DONE FASTER THAN YOU DID YES YOU DID. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE BUT NOT THAT IT'S A CONTEST THANK YOU. FOR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HEARING. EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED THE CREDIT EARNING PROCESS IS. A WAY TO ENSURE PEOPLE GET INTO THE REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO AND WE'VE BEEN SETTING UP A STRUCTURE. THAT PROVIDES HOPE FOR THOSE INSIDE. TO WANT TO DO THE THE WORK THAT WE WE EXPECT THEM TO DO THAT THEY NEED TO DO. IN ORDER TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM GET BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES IN APPROPRIATE WAYS THAT'S WHAT THEIR CREDIT EARNING PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO DO. THERE'S A BIT OF AN ISSUE HOWEVER BECAUSE WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES ELDERLY PRO PAROLE. AND THOSE WHO MEET THE YOUTH OFFENDER PRO REQUIREMENTS. THE WAY THAT CREDITS ARE CALCULATED IS NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT UNDER PROP. FIFTY SEVEN SOMEONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE FOR THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE OR THE ELDERLY PAROLE THOSE CREDITS DON'T FOLD INTO. THE WAY WE ALLOCATE CREDITS IN A PREDICTABLE WAY. THIS BILL IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE THAT AND WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CDC ARE TO LOOK AT THEIR PROCESSES AND TAYLOR THIS SO THAT. SOMEONE WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO TAKEADVANTAGE OF CREDITS EITHER AS A YOUTH OFFENDER OR AS AN L. NUMBER OF WHO IS. BEN IN PRISON FOR IT WAS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY BETTER PRISON FOR OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THAT THEY CAN THEN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE CREDIT SYSTEM NOW THIS IS NOT AS THE OPPOSITION IS RAISED SOME CONCERNS A MATTER OF LETTING PEOPLE OUT OF PRISON EARLY IT'S A MATTER OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE CAN GET TO A PAROLE DATE. AND HAVE INCENTIVES TO GET TO A PAROLE DATE AND MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE CASE THEY TEND TO THAT PAROLE BOARD. THAT'S WHY THOSE CREDITS ARE IMPORTANT. THOSE WERE THAT'S HOW THOSE THOSE INCENTIVES WORK FOR INMATES ON THE INSIDE. SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL CLEANING UP THE PERSPECTIVE UNDER PROPERTY SEVEN A NUMBER THAT CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN RECENT MADE RECENTLY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE. A CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF CREDITS ACROSS THE BOARD AND GIVE PEOPLE ON THE INSIDE THE INSIDE IS THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE TO STRUCTURE THEM. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF MEMBERS HERE SPONSORS WHO ARE SUPPORTING THE BILL. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS MY NAME IS TYAN OF ARGUS ADMIT I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF INITIATE JUSTICE AN ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO AND MASS INCARCERATION BY ACTIVATING THE POWER OF THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY IT. WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSOR EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE FOR MANY REASONS BUT I'LL HIGHLIGHT THREE THIS MORNING. WIND CALIFORNIA SENTENCING LAWS ARE EXTREMELY HARSH AND THEY REMOVE HOPE FROM PEOPLE'S LIVES EVEN WITH RELIEF UNDER YOUTH OFFENDER OR ELDER PAROLE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AS A VERY LONG TIME. THE SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS OR THE THOUGHT OF DYING IN PRISON MAKES PEOPLE MORE LIKELY TO MAKE HARMFUL CHOICES THAT THREATEN THE SAFETY OF THE INSTITUTION AND PERPETUATE CYCLES OF TRAUMA AND VIOLENCE. TO THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT EARLY RELEASE BUT ABOUT A HEARING AND A CHANCE TO PROVE ONESELF READY FOR PAROLE. ALL CREDIT MUST BE EARNED THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF EDUCATION ON REHABILITATIVE AND SELF HELP PROGRAMS. AND MOST PEOPLE WILL NOT BE RELEASED AS CDC ARE ONLY FIND PAROLE EVERY YEAR. THIS BILL ONE MINUTE WILL MERELY ACT AS AN INCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO INVEST THE TIME AND WORK NECESSARY TO BE SUCCESSFUL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY. AND THREE INCREASING INCENTIVES FOR POSITIVE PROGRAMMING WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM A TWENTY TWELVE CDC OUR REPORT FOUND THE COLLEGE GRADUATES HAD A 5% RECIDIVISM RATE COMPARED TO A MATCH COMPARISON GROUP THAT HAD A 21% RECIDIVISM RATE. A TWENTY EIGHTEEN INITIATE JUSTICE SURVEY FOUND THAT 80% OF PEOPLE WITH YOU DEFENDER HEARINGS ARE PARTICIPATING IN REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND 70% OF THEM ARE IN SCHOOL. PROVING THAT THEY ARE MOTIVATED TO TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND AND DESERVE A CHANCE TO COME HOME SOONER. THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN REGULATION SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR YOUTH OFFENDER AN ELDERLY PAROLE BUT TECHNICALITIES AND HOW THOSE LAWS WERE WRITTEN MADE IT SO THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THAT THEY COULD NOT INCLUDE THEM IN CREDITS. THIS BILL WILL CORRECT THAT AND WOULD PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BEGIN TO END OUR ADDICTION TO PUNISHMENT AND FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES SAFER I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE THOSE NEXT WITNESS. THE MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICHARD MORALIS AND I'M A MEMBER OF INITIATE JUSTICE THIS IS MY FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO ADVOCATE OUTSIDE OF THE PRISON GATES. SINCE BEEN RELEASED JUST TWELVE DAYS AGO. I WAS IN PRISON FOR TWENTY YEARS SEVEN MONTHS AND TWENTY ONE DAYS. I WAS SINCE THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE AT THE AGE OF TWENTY AT THAT TIME I COULDN'T FATHOM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR FREEDOM. BUT HERE I AM. AFTER NEARLY A YEAR IN I KNEW I NEEDED TO CHANGE. AT THE END OF NINETEEN NINETY NINE WITH THE HELP OF GOD AND FAMILY I EMBARKED ON A NEW PATH. I STARTED LIVING RESPONSIBLY AND NEVER RECEIVED A RULES VIOLATION WHILE INCARCERATED. I EARNED A BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE DEGREE AND BECAME ONE OF SEVEN TO RECEIVE SENATORIAL RECOGNITION AS A STATE CERTIFIED ALCOHOL AND DRUG COUNSELOR SPONSORED BY THE CROP ORGANIZATION. IN ADDITION I HEAVILY PARTICIPATED IN SELF HELP REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. PROP FIFTY SEVEN ALLOWED FOR ME TO GET TO MY PAROLE BOARD HEARING NINE MONTHS EARLY. BUT I WAS NOT ALLOWED TO EARN ANY TIME OFF OF MY YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE DATE. SENATE BILLS. TWO SIXTY TO SIXTY ONE AB THIRTEEN AWAIT. AND PROPERTY SEVEN CREATED HOPE FOR MANY OF MY INCARCERATED FRIENDS WHO COULDN'T SEE A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE STILL INSIDE WHO ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO BETTER THEMSELVES WITH NO HOPE OF COMING HOME ANYTIME SOONER. FOR EXAMPLE MY BEST FRIEND TAKE GREAT. HAS BEEN IN PRISON FOR NINETEEN YEARS HE'S THE HARDEST WORKING MAN I KNOW. HE JUST COMPLETED HIS MASTER'S DEGREE. AND LEADS MANY SELF HELP GROUPS. BUT BECAUSE OF EXISTING LAW ALL CREDIT HE EARNS WILL COME OFF OF HIS ORIGINAL SENTENCE OF FORTY YEARS TO LIFE. NOT HIS YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE DATE OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS. IF AB NINE SIXTY FIVE PASSES HE COULD GO TO BOARD SOONER. AND HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR HIS HARD WORK AS I WAS [inaudible] I'M FORTUNATE. THAT I WAS ABLE TO EARN TIME OFF MY CENTER. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO WORK JUST AS HARD AS I DID. BUT THERE BUT THEY HAVE TO REMAIN IN PRISON. U. DEFENDER LIKE TED WILL EVENTUALLY GET OUT OF PRISON. AND I BELIEVE THE PUBLIC WOULD PREFER. IF THEY'RE RELEASED A FEW YEARS EARLIER BECAUSE THEY WORK EXTRA HARD TO EARN THEIR FREEDOM THROUGH A GREAT COMMITMENT TO THEIR OWN REHABILITATION. I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR AYE VOTE FOR A. B. NINE SIXTY FIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MARCO GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT.

I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THOSE THAT'S HOPING IT WORKING HARD FOR RELEASE DATE I FULLY SUPPORT THIS BILL WHEN I EXPERT YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU. FUNDING CROWDY POLICY FELLOW AT ALL OF US AND NINE LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THE MORNING MY NAME IS ROLE MARILYN ROSTEN A WITH THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR WOMEN PRISONERS WERE PROUD CO SPONSOR WE STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ERIC ANDERSON POLICY DIRECTOR AND INITIATE JUSTICE PROUD BECAUSE SPONSOR. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- OPPOSITION I'M SORRY. I JUST GOT BACK TO MY COMMANDER WHACK RIGHT NOW. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS COMMITTEE LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE REGRETTABLY ARE IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLYMAN STONE'S AB. NINE SIXTY FIVE AFTER THE PROFESSOR TO PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN CDC ARE INCREASED CONDUCT CREDITS AND ADDED CATEGORIES OF CONDUCT CREDIT. PRIOR TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN MURDERS EARNS ZERO CONDUCT CRITICS PURSUANT TO PENAL CODE SECTION TWO NINE THREE THREE POINT. TWO A YOUTHFUL OFFENDER FOR EXAMPLE SENTENCE TO TWENTY FEET FIVE YEARS TO LIFE FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER SERVED AN ACTUAL TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE BEING ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. NOW AFTER PROP FIFTY SEVEN THAT SAME INMATE EARNS 20% CREDITS AND MAYBE MORE IF HE OR SHE EARNS ANY OF THE OTHER EXTRA CREDIT THAT CDA CDC ARE CREATED. PROP FIFTY SEVEN CREDITS OF AT LEAST 20% WILL GET THE INMATE TO A PAROLE HEARING AT YEAR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BEFORE PENAL CODE SECTION THIRTY FIFTY ONE WOULD MAKE THE DEFENDANT ELIGIBLE FOR A PAROLE HEARING. SIMILARLY ELDERLY INMATES ARE ALSO NOW EARNING AT LEAST 20% CONDUCT CRITICS FOR THEIR CRIMES LESS SENTENCED TO DEATH OR LIFE WITHOUT. PAROLE IT IS IMPORTANT WE NOT SHORTEN THE TIME PERIOD SPECIFIED IN PENAL CODE SECTION THIRTY FIFTY ONE MPC. THIRTY FIFTY FIVE BECAUSE INMATES WHO WERE SENTENCED CONSECUTIVELY FOR MULTIPLE MURDERS OR SERIOUS SEX CRIMES FOR EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT GET A PAROLE HEARING ANY EARLIER THAN THEY CAN NOW UNDER THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN CHANGES. THE VERY GENEROUS CREDITS ADOPTED BY CDC ARE PURSUANT TO PROP FIFTY SEVEN ALREADY PROVIDE FOR EARLY PAROLE FOR OFFENDERS. ADDING CONDUCT CREDITS TO THESE TWO STATUTES NOT ONLY GETS VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND SEX OFFENDERS RELEASED EVEN EARLIER. IT EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF TREATING MULTIPLE CRIME OFFENDERS THE SAME AS ONE CRIME OFFENDERS. WE BELIEVE THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AGREE THAT A PERSON WHO COMMITS TO FIRST DEGREE MURDERS SHOULD FACE A MORE SIGNIFICANT PUNISHMENT. THAT A PERSON WHO COMMITS ONE FIRST DEGREE MURDER. YET UNDER THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL A PERSON WHO COMMITS TO FIRST DEGREE MURDERS. AND IS SENTENCED TO FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE HEARING AT YOUR TWENTY THE SAME AS A DEFENDANT SENTENCED FOR ONE MURDER. SIMILARLY THE BILL CREATES INEQUITIES BASED ON THE AGE OF THE OFFENDER AT THE TIME OF THE CRIME. UNDER EXISTING LAW A THIRTY YEAR OLD DEFENDANT CURRENTLY SENTENCED TO FIFTY YEARS TO LIFE OR A FIFTY YEAR DETERMINANT SENTENCE FOR FORCIBLE SEX CRIMES. AT AGE THIRTY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE AT THE FORTY YEAR MARK WHEN HE OR SHE IS SEVENTY YEARS OLD IF HE OR SHE EARNS A AS CURRENTLY WORDED AB NINE SIXTY FIVE WOULD GET THE SAME SEX OFFENDER TO A PAROLE HEARING TEN YEARS EARLIER. HAVING SERVED THIRTY CONTINUOUS YEARS MORE THAN THE TWENTY FIVE CONTINUOUS YEARS REQUIRED BY PC. THREE OH FIVE FIVE CONSEQUENTLY. DEFENDANTS WHO COMMIT THEIR CRIMES LATER IN LIFE WILL HAVE A HUGE ADVANTAGE OVER YOUNGER OFFENDERS IF CONDUCT CREDITS APPLIED TO REDUCE THE REQUIREMENT OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF CONTINUOUS INCARCERATION. FOR ELDERLY PAROLE. IN SOME PROPOSITION FIFTY SEVEN ALREADY CREATED VERY GENEROUS CREDITS THE PROVIDE FOR EARLY PAROLE FOR OFFENDERS. ADDING CONDUCT CREDITS TO PC THREE OH FIVE ONE AND THREE OH FIVE FIVE IS THIS BILL PROPOSES. NOT ONLY GETS VIOLENT OFFENDERS AND SEX OFFENDERS RELEASED EVEN EARLIER IT EXACERBATES THE PROBLEM OF TREATING MULTIPLE CRIME OFFENDERS THE SAME AS ONE CRIME OFFENDERS. AND PERPETUATES THE PC THREE OH FIVE FIVE INEQUITIES. THAT ARISE BASED ON THE AGE OF AN OFFENDER WHEN HE OR SHE IS SENTENCED FOR THESE REASONS WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU YES SIR GEN MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION -- ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE BUT I WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE HISTORICAL CONTEXT INTO THIS THAT'S IMPORTANT -- THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION WORKED WITH SENATOR HANCOCK ON SB TWO SIXTY IN TWO SIX ONE THE BILL THAT ORIGINALLY CREATED THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE PROCESS. AND IN THE BILL THAT JUMP THAT -- I EXPANDED IT FROM. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY THREE YOU KNOW WE WE LISTENED. LONG AND HARD TO THE DEBATE ABOUT YOU KNOW IT HE'S BEING. YOUNG INDIVIDUALS THAT MAYBE HAD AND HAD YOU KNOW AT THAT. TIME TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE DECISIONS OF THEIR MAKING WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE NEUTRAL WHEN THOSE BILLS WOULD REALLY WENT THROUGH. THIS PROCESS AND THEN BEFORE YOU KNOW EVEN A FEW YEARS INTO THE PROGRAM WE CAN EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY WERE BEING. WE DECIDED TO JUMP THE AGE FROM. TWENTY THREE TO TWENTY FIVE AND NOW WE'RE HERE BACK AGAIN EXPANDING THE PROGRAM. NOW THE THIRD TIME WITHOUT REALLY KIND I THINK ANYONE UNDERSTANDING HOW IT'S AFFECTED HOW IT'S BEING USED RIGHT NOW -- THE IMPACT THAT IT'S HAVING ON THE SYSTEM WE ALSO HAD PROP FIFTY SEVEN AS THE DA'S NOTED -- THAT IS CREATED ADDITIONAL CREDIT EARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED -- AT SOME POINT YOU KNOW WE JUST HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION YOU KNOW WHEN IT WHEN A WE'RE GONNA STOP HERE I MEAN WE WENT OUT ON A LIMB. TO SUPPORT YOU THE FENDER PAROLE -- IN THE EXPANSION OF THAT ALL THE WAY UP TO AGE TWENTY THREE AND THEN IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THAT YOU KNOW WE WE MAKE A STEP FORWARD. YOU KNOW WERE ASKED TO COME BACK AND GO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THAT'S WHERE CONCERN HERE IS WE'VE WE'VE CONTINUED TO A ROAD. CONSEQUENCES AT SOME POINT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE GOOD. PUBLIC SAFETY OF OUR SOCIETY HI AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVALUATED THE IMPACT THAT'S ME ALL THIS REFORMERS HAD IN THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS. AND THIS IS JUST CONTINUING. TO A ROAD THAT SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND FOR THOSE CONCERNS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS COURCELLES ALONG BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR QUIRK. YEAH FOR ME FIRST OF ALL ARE MISTER STONE I THINK YOU'RE. ONE OF OUR BEST LEGISLATORS AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU. BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- FOR THE RECENTLY RELEASED INCARCERATED PERSON IT'S AMAZING -- YOUR POISE AFTER TWENTY YEARS IN PRISON COME IN HERE AND SPEAK I'M EXTREMELY IMPRESSED. PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL AND WHY DO WE LET THEM OUT. I DON'T THINK THE SEX OFFENDER OR A MURDERER IS THINKING WHEN THEY SHOOT SOMEONE. SHE WEARS STATE JUST PASSED A BILL AND IF I TAKE COURSES I CAN GET OUT IN TWENTY YEARS INSTEAD OF TWENTY FIVE THAT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT THIS DOES DO IS IS IT ALLOWS THE PAROLE BOARD TO MAKE A DECISION AT AN EARLIER POINT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE THE PERSON WHO IS BEFORE ME RIGHT NOW? WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP PEOPLE IN PRISON WE NO LONGER. POSE A THREAT [inaudible] AND THAT TO ME IS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE. THERE ARE PRISON SHOULD HAVE WHICH IS TO GET PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY NO LONGER PRESENT. HAVE A POSE A THREAT THIS IS A WAY WHEN SOMEONE DOES INCORPORATE EXCUSE ME INCARCERATED. TO GIVE THEM AN INCENTIVE SO THAT THEY'LL BE LIKE THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME WHEN THEY GET OUT THANK YOU. OUR MOVE THE BELL. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. NONE OKAY. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND I WILL POINT OUT THE OPPOSITION IS REALLY ESSENTIALLY RELITIGATE ING THE THE EXISTING LAW WELL WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS TAYLOR THE CREDITS FROM THE YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE. AND THE ELDERLY PAROLE INTO THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN CDC ARE. INTERPRETING PROP FIFTY SEVEN A CITED THAT THEY COULD NOT DO THAT WE THINK THEY CAN AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH CDC ARE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO LET PEOPLE OUT. EARLIER BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE TO GO TO PAROLE I TRUST THAT PROCESS. WE WANT TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES THAT PEOPLE DO THE WORK INSIDE THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BEST CASE BEFORE PAROLE. THAT TO ME IS WHAT THE SYSTEM IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THEY NEED TO ADDRESS THEN COME BACK INTO SOCIETY. WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND UP AND AND AT SOME POINT WE WERE AFTER TRUST TO SYSTEM WITHIN CDC ARE. I MEAN I EVEN THAT'S WHY DID THE AUDIT ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN GET SOME TYPE OF EVALUATION I THINK. ON THE OPPOSITION IS RIGHT WE NEED TO START LOOKING. AT ALL THESE PROGRAMS IN ITS TOTALITY AND HOW IT IMPACTED COMMUNITY IN. HOW INDIVIDUALS LIKE THE ONE THAT CAME TODAY HOW THEY ARE IMPACTING THE COMMUNITY -- STILL LOOKING AT THE BAD SIDE OF IT -- I HONESTLY BELIEVE WHEN WE DO THAT EVALUATION FOR YOU SOME VERY POSITIVE RESULTS FROM THAT -- AND IT I I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT DAY WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL THAT WE'VE DONE -- IN THE LAST FIVE SIX YEARS -- IN THE SEA THAT IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO THE IMPACT ON INDIVIDUALS LIKE THIS THE SHERMAN HERE HIS HIS LIFE AND HOW IT'S CHANGED THEM. AND HOW WE'RE BETTER OFF AS A SOCIETY. FOR FOR DOING THIS AND YOU'RE RIGHT IT DOESN'T GUARANTEED IT WHEN THEY GO BEFORE THE PAROLE BOARD. THAT THEY WILL BE RELEASED THAT IS OUR BACKSTOPS AND WE NEED TO TRUST THAT BACKSTOPS WITH THE PAROLE HEARING BOARD. ON THAT DAY NO BECAUSE THEY'RE INSIDE NOTE TALKING THESE INDIVIDUALS AND CDC ARE AND DAY -- CCPOA OFFICERS ARE ALL TALKING THEY KNOW THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEY SHOULD KNOW WHO SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT SHOULD SHOULD NOT GET OUT. AND SO. I RECOMMENDED I AN EIGHTY NINE SIXTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE pJONES SAWYER. CHEN SIR I LACKEY [inaudible] BAUER-KAHAN [inaudible] DEEP. KAMLAGER-DOVE.

EIGHTEEN THANK YOU -- CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THREE SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD THIS BILL MULTIPLE TIMES BEFORE -- AB ELEVEN FORTY FIVE SIMPLIFIES THE LAUPER MANDATED REPORTERS. CURRENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR MANDATED REPORTERS OF CHILD ABUSE ARE CONFUSING INCONSISTENT AND DISCRIMINATORY. THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO LIE REPORTABLE SEXUAL ACTS IN A MORE CONCISE AND EQUITABLE WAY. UNDER CURRENT LAW. A MANDATED REPORTER IS NINETY TWO REPORT WHEN A MINOR A SEVENTEEN AND ENGAGES WITH VOLUNTARY HETEROSEXUAL SEX OF THE PARTNER THAT IS THE SAME AGE OF SEVENTEEN HOWEVER IF THOSE TWO INDIVIDUALS ARE GAY OR LESBIAN. AND ARE THE SAME AGE A MANDATED REPORTERS REQUIRED EVEN IF THE ACTS ARE VOLUNTARY. THE CONFUSING AND DISCRIMINATORY NATURE OF CURRENT LAW ULTIMATELY LEADS TO MANDATED REPORTERS NOT REPORTING CERTAIN ACTS. THIS CREATES AN UNEVEN PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL MINORS FORTY FIVE CREATES CLEAR CONSISTENT AND NON THIS WITH TERRY STANDARDS FOR MANDATED REPORTERS BY TREATING ALL CONSENSUAL ACTIVITY. THE SAME WAY. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE A LOT FOR STATUTORY RAPE OR CHILD ABUSE. THESE WOULD BE STILL BE REPORTED. THE MAN THAT A REPORTER WOULD STILL BE REQUIRED TO DISTINGUISH THAT THE OUR ACTS THAT THE ACTS ARE VOLUNTARY. THE DC OPINION ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IS DOES THAT AN OPINION AND IS NOT CHANGED -- Là. AB ELEVEN FORTY BY CONFORMS THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE REGARDING THE DEFINITION OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. TO THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE DC A OPINION. AB ELEVEN FORTY FIVE ENSURES THAT OUR YOUTH IS TREATED FAIRLY AND CLARIFIES MANDATED REPORTERS MUST REPORT. WHAT MUST REPORTER AMENITY BOARDS MUST REPORT AND WHAT GUIDELINES TO FOLLOW WHEN ISSUE IN CLINICAL JUDGMENT?

THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEE A NUN ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF COMMENTS YES ARCADE. SO CAN YOU JUST ONE CLARIFICATION ON THE STATE OF ALIVE TODAY SO SEXUAL PENETRATION BETWEEN THESE AGE GROUPS. IS NOT MANDATED REPORTING THAT IRAN IS MUTU SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS AND IT WAS A CONSENSUAL VOLUNTARY -- ENGAGEMENT WE DO NOT NEED TO REPORT THAT. BUT IF ONLY IF IT'S HETEROSEXUAL IF IT'S THE SAME SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDSBUT THEY'RE GAY. I HAVE TO REPORT THAT I GOT IT VOLUNTARY CONSENSUAL IN THIS AGE GROUP. SO AS I READ THE BILL THOUGH I AM IF IT'S A TWENTY YEAR OLDS AND A SIXTEEN YEAR OLD AS WELL. THERE WOULD BE NO NEED TO REPORTS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE THE SAME AGE RIGHT UNDER YOUR BILL. RIGHT NOW ALL OF THEIR HETEROSEXUAL I DON'T NEED TO REPORT THAT NOW EITHER. OKAY. IF THERE IS ABUSE AGAIN IT'S BACK TO THE CLINICAL JUDGMENT. ABOUT THAT AS THE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN WITH THESE WITH THESE FOLKS BUT MY BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE AGE GROUP WHICH IS SAYING THAT IT BETH. GARY STRAIGHT WE SHOULD BE. IN THIS THING. GOT IT. THANK YOU.

THIRTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- WE'RE HERE TO PRESENT AB TEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH WOULD OPEN THE DOORS. TO MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE FACING EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING BARRIERS BY AUTOMATING. THE PROCESS OF CLEARING IN A RASTER CRIMINAL RECORD FOR ELIGIBLE. INDIVIDUALS. WE ESTIMATE ABOUT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO WHO ARE CURRENTLY HAVE. CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AND AS YOU KNOW -- MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TOTAL CONVICTIONS HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING EMPLOYMENT GETTING HOUSING -- REALLY BY CLEARING IN EXPANDING THE RECORDS THAT THEY ALREADY ELIGIBLE TO HAVE EXPLAINED TO REALLY -- OPENS UP THE PATHWAY TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING -- LAST YEAR WE INTRODUCED AB -- TWENTY FOUR THIRTY EIGHT WHICH ASKED THE COURTS TO PROACTIVELY DO THERE'S THAT STOP YOUR TO BE PROSPEROUS BUT AT THIS YEAR WE ARE REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO CREATE A DATABASE THE DATABASE WOULD THEN BE CIRCULATED TO THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY COURTS. IN THE COURTS WOULD MERELY BE JUST BE ASKED TO WITHHOLD THE RECORDS OF THOSE FOLKS WITHIN THE DATABASE WE THINK THIS IS A MUCH MORE [inaudible] COST. SORT OF A COSTLY. LESS COSTLY SOLUTION AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO PASSED THIS BILL AGAIN I HAVE TWO WITNESSES HERE. A BRICK HOUSE THEN TO SPEAK ON A. B. TEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELLO MAX ABA WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO DISKETTES HERNIAS OFFICE FIRST AND FOREMOST JUST WANNA THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING -- FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE -- THIS IS REALLY A LANDMARK CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM INITIATIVE THERE ARE. AT LEAST TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE A CRIMINAL CONVICTION THAT ARE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE TO HAVE THAT RECORD. I CLEARED -- THERE'S MILLIONS MORE WHO HAVE AN ARREST ON THE RECORD THAT COULD ALSO BE CLEARED -- MANY PEOPLE DON'T SEEK THAT RELIEF -- THEY HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT THEY HAVE TO GO GET AN ATTORNEY OFTEN TO TO ACTUALLY GET THE RELIEF -- DONE THAT CAN BE EXPENSIVE -- ENDS THAT CAN BE A HINDRANCE TO EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND THAT HAS. IMPACTS ON PUBLIC SAFETY -- PEOPLE WHO ARE THERE IN A PRIMARY DRIVERS OF RECIDIVISM OUR LACK OF ACCESS TO HOUSING EMPLOYMENT AND SO THIS IS.

MY NAME IS KATIE DIXON -- A POLICY FELLOW WITH LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN AND ALL OF US ARE NONE. AND I AM HERE TODAY IN SOLIDARITY WITH CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. I FIRST WANT TO PAYING ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAMS OFFICE AND SF -- DISTRICT ATTORNEY GASKELL'S OFFICE FOR COMING TOGETHER AND REALLY PUT IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TOGETHER THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND AS HE SAID I BELIEVE THIS CAN BE GROUND BREAKING A TRANSFORMATIVE FOR THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM LANDSCAPE. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WILL CLEAN SLATE CLINICS AN EXPUNGEMENT PROCESS. OBVIOUSLY ON FORMALLY INCARCERATED. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I HAVE BEEN ON A ROLLER COASTER RIDE. TRYING TO RE ESTABLISH MYSELF BACK INTO SOCIETY. AS A RESULT OF OUR CRIMINAL HISTORY I HAVE BEEN RELEGATED TO LOW WAGE LABOR JOBS. EVEN THOUGH I HOLD A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE. I HAVE BEEN HOMELESS UNABLE -- TO FOR RAIN IN A BAY AREA IN UNAFRAID TO APPLY FOR ROOM SHEARS BECAUSE I'M AFRAID THEY'LL RUN A BACKGROUND CHECK. WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT AN EXPUNGEMENT CLINIC IN SAN FRANCISCO I IMMEDIATELY APPLY TO IT? AS SOON AS I KNEW IT WAS AVAILABLE THAT PROCESS TOOK ME A WHOLE YEAR. THE PROCESS WAS [inaudible] HELLO. IT WAS IT WAS VERY COMPLICATED AND QUITE FRANKLY WAS PRETTY RIDICULOUS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I MOVED ON TO APPLY TO SOLANO COUNTY. THAT TOOK ME SIX MONTHS AND NO SIX MONTHS I LOST ANOTHER JOB I WAS GOING BACK AND FORTH TO COURT CASES IN FAIRFIELD. I ALSO LOST MY SHELTER BAY WHICH I WAS ALREADY HOMELESS I LOST MY SHELTER BE IT AS A RESULT OF TRYING TO SPEND A NIGHT. IN THE LAY ALSO I COULD BE CLOSER TO FAIRFIELD IN ORDER TO GIVE BACK AND FORTH TO COURT. IN ALL THIS WAS GOING ON WHILE I WAS. STILL TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THIS PROCESS. I'M HERE TODAY AS A POLICY FELLOW. BECAUSE PASSED AN A. B. TEN SEVENTY SIX I BELIEVE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR CALIFORNIA. OPPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AS WE KNOW I DON'T KNOW SOME MAY NOT KNOW HAS A WENT IS JUST THE WINDOW PERIOD FOR US TO GO AHEAD AND GET WHATEVER WHATEVER WE CAN GET RE CLASSIFIED AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT PERIOD ENDS INTO A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AS HE SAID. YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT IN THIS PROCESS TOOK ME OVER A YEAR CLOSE TO TWO YEARS I CAN ONLY IMAGINE FOR THE FOLKS THAT DOES NOT HAVE COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS BECAUSE IT HELPED MY PROCESS. THIS THIS WOULD THIS BILL. WOULD GIVE CALIFORNIA'S LIKE MYSELF THE FREEDOM TO FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD. AND AMBIENT SSR COMMUNITIES WHILE NOT BE A SIDE TRACKED IN DISMAY HOMELESSNESS IN JOB INSTABILITY WHICH QUITE FRANKLY JUST CONTINUES TO TRY ME IN A CYCLE OF POVERTY. PEOPLE DESERVES A CHANCE TO OVERCOME THE MISTAKES OF THEIR PASS AND WE SHOULD BE GIVEN HIM EVERY CHANCE TO DO SO AND MAKE IT AND NOT GOING OUT OF OUR WAY TO MAKE IT AS HARD AS POSSIBLE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THIS I URGE AYE VOTE ON THIS THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS TO ME THIS YEAR I FEEL LIKE THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO IMPACT. AGAIN I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS SOMEONE SAY SOMETHING CLOSE TO TWO MILLION FOLKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I URGE AYE VOTE AND THANK YOU FOR LET MY VOICE BE HEARD TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU. IN THE OTHER [inaudible] IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. MARCO GEORGE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. KATHY SURE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. CAN MORE YOU W. IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MORE SECONDS ALSO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT. JIM WINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. KYLE MOSLEY OSCAR STEEL WITH COMMUNITY WORKS IN SUPPORT. NOT HERNANDEZ AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY -- ANY WITNESSES IN. GOOD. EDWARD LITTLE CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYWAY THIS IS OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH THERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION A WRECKER SUPERVISORS RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AS WERE I'M SURE HOW THIS. LEGISLATION -- WILL AFFECT ALL THE FOUR HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LOCALLY AND HOW IDEA TO AUTOMATE THEIR SYSTEMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSEWHO ARE ELIGIBLE WERE ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO THIS -- SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS LOGISTICS OF THIS IS GOING TO WORK THAT WERE WILLING TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. AND AS OF RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OR ANY OTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- FIRST I'LL MOVE THE BELL. ALL RIGHT I THINK THE RECORDS CLERKS ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AS CHAIR OF BUDGET IS THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE RECORD CLERKS I THINK. TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT. SURE NOT ABOUT TURN OVER THE DA'S OFFICE BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN TALKING TO Y. DOJ. AGAIN THE IDEA IS ASKING DOJ TO PUT TOGETHER -- THE DATABASE OF ALL THE MILLIONS OF NAMES AND THEN BY HAVING A CENTRALIZED. DATABASE WHICH WILL BE UPDATED. AND KEPT UP TO DATE THE STATE LEVEL THAT DATABASE WILL THEN BE CIRCULATED TO ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES. SO AGAIN THE COUNTIES WILL REALLY HAVE TO AUTOMATE ANYTHING THEY WOULD JUST NEED TO BE ABLE TO REFERENCE THE DATABASE AND THEN. BE ABLE TO NOT RELEASE THE INFORMATION ONCE THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE PEOPLE ARE CALLING ABOUT SPECIFIC PEOPLE SO. HOW HOW THEY WANT TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION THEY'RE RECEIVING FROM THE STATE? AND DO SOMETHING WITH THE RECORDS IS REALLY UP TO THEM BUT ALL WERE TO ASK THEM IS NOT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE. AND I WOULD SAID I'M SORRY. THE PROFESSOR -- I WOULD SAY ACTUALLY THAT COURT SIX CROSS THE STATE ARE ALREADY DOING THIS ARE ALREADY DECIDING WHICH RECORDS TO RELEASE IN WHICH RECORDS TO NOT RELEASE -- THIS WOULD THROUGH THE CURRENT DOJ DATABASE OR BE AN ALGORITHM THAT WOULD BE APPLIED SO WOULD BE A COMPUTER PROGRAM WHICH WOULD LOOK AT BASICALLY. ASSESS ELIGIBILITY WHICH IS THE CURRENT ELIGIBILITY UNDER CURRENT LAW AND IT WOULD AUTOMATE THE SYSTEM OF WHO IS ELIGIBLE AND WHO'S NOT. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE BY THIS COMPUTER PROGRAM WOULD. THERE BY HAS RECORD CLEARANCE RELIEF GRANTED AUTOMATICALLY INSTEAD OF GOING TO A PETITION BASED PROCESS WHICH REQUIRES THE COURT TO HEAR THIS AND TO MAKE A DETERMINATION WHICH IS. A DE FACTO EFFECTIVELY IT HAPPENS ALMOST AUTOMATICALLY IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE BUT IT'S BASICALLY JUST. IF THEY MEET THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENT THE COURT GRANTED SO THIS WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY WILL IN THE LONG TERM ACTUALLY REDUCE COSTS BY. USING COMPUTERS TO DO WHAT WHAT IS RIGHT NOW A VERY ONEROUS HUMAN PROCESS -- AND THEN A NOTIFICATION WILL GO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO THE COUNTY COURTS AND THEN THEY'LL JUST DO WHAT THEY CURRENTLY DO THEY LOOK AT WHICH RECORDS THEY CAN AND THEY CAN'T PROVIDE. TO THE PERSON REQUESTING RECORDS -- AND THEN YOU KNOW OF MARIA MCKEE WHO'S A PRINCIPAL ANALYST AT OUR OFFICE IS VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE DOJ DATABASES AND WHAT INFORMATION IS AND IS NOT. ABLE TO BE AUTOMATED -- AND SHE HAS REALLY BEEN DOING A PHENOMENAL JOB TO TO PUT TOGETHER SOME MORE ELIGIBILITY REQUIRE SOME MORE TO DICTATE MORE CLEARLY TO THE DOJ. BASED ON WHAT IS IN THEIR DATABASE WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE AUTOMATED SO WE'VE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS TO TRY TO MAKE IT AS LITTLE. AS LITTLE AS LEAST ONEROUS AS POSSIBLE IN THE DOJ AND EVERYONE ELSE. COOL. JUST. ONE ONE QUICK POINT TO ADD JUST UNDERSTAND WHY WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT IS. RIGHT NOW WE ESTIMATE THE COST TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL WHO'S PURSUING EXPUNGEMENT IS ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW WE FAMILIES DON'T EVEN HAVE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THEIR SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THEY'RE NEVER GOING TO PURSUE EXPUNGEMENT AND THEN IF THEY NEVER PURSUE EXPUNGEMENT AGAIN. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT SO THEY END UP ON THE CAO WORKS ROLES IN ABOUT CAL FRESH ROLLS TO THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE FROM THE STATE POINT OF VIEW. AN AUTOMATED RECORD SYSTEM -- IS PRESUMED TO COSTS ABOUT FOUR CENTS PER RECORD IN COMPARISON TO THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS OKAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I JUST IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP WITH A STATE -- SO AGAIN I WAS HOMELESS AND POOR THE ONLY REASON I WAS ABLE TO GET THE PROCESS IS BECAUSE I HAD COMMUNITY HELP WITHOUT THAT COMMUNITY HELP. I WOULD NOT HAVE PURSUED THIS PROCESS BECAUSE IT DOES COST UPWARDS OF THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YOU MAY CLOSE MR TASTERS BUT FAST FIVE A JUDGE RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE CALL THE ROLL. ON AB TEN SEVENTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER -- ACTIONS ARE AYE LACKEY. BAUER-KAHAN BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS HI WICKS I THANK YOU. THE MEASURE PASSED. MR OBERNOLTE YOUR NEXT ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN ITEM NUMBER. NINETEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN A. B. NINE FIFTY THREE IMPOSED A REQUIREMENT ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. TO FILE A REPORT AFTER CONDUCTING A STOP AND THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATION -- DEFINED A STOP AS A CONSENSUAL OR NON CONSENSUAL SEARCH OF A PERSON'S -- EITHER BODY OR PROPERTY HOWEVER THE LEGISLATION WAS AMBIGUOUS ON WHETHER OR NOT A STOP INCLUDED A CALL FOR SERVICE IN OTHER WORDS -- A RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO A MEDICAL SITUATION THE AUTHOR STATED THAT -- THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT TO INCLUDE THAT SO THIS BILL AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN CLARIFIES THAT THE REQUIREMENT TO FOLLOW THE FILE OF THOSE REPORTS -- IS NOT TRIGGERED MERELY BY A CALL FOR SERVICE -- THEY HAVE TO SAY THAT -- THE REASON BEHIND THIS BILL IS THAT THOSE REPORTS THAT ARE FILED ARE NOT FREE THEY COST A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME. AND ALTHOUGH I RECOGNIZE THE REASONING BEHIND THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE REPORTS -- I DON'T I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A SOCIETY TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE THAT DO GOOD IN THE THINGS THAT REQUIRE THAT DO NOT. SO I WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS SHERIFF JOHN MCMAHON OF SAN MEDINA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE JUST A BIT. I'M ONE OF THE LARGE AGENCIES IN THE STATE THAT IMPLEMENTED THEM NINE FIFTY THREE PROCESS IN JULY OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN PUT IT IN CONTEXT. WE HANDLE ABOUT AN ABOUT A MILLION CALLS FOR SERVICE ANNUALLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND ABOUT 30% OF THOSE ARE DISPATCHED IN THE OTHER. 770% ARE THOSE THAT ARE ARE CALLED IN BY SOMEBODY THAT IS REPORTING A CRIME. 30% ARE THOSE THAT ARE SELF INITIATED BY OUR FOLKS WHETHER BE -- TRAFFIC STOPS OR ST OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. OUT OF THAT NUMBER OF CALLS FOR SERVICE THUS FAR WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL HANDLE OR WE WILL PREPARE ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND WITH THE FORMS. THIS YEAR. SO THOSE PRIMARILY OR FOR THOSE SELF INITIATED CALLS FOR SERVICE ABOUT 20% OF THOSE AT THIS POINT. ARE THOSE THAT ARE DISPATCHED SO. DISPATCH CALLS WOULD BE MAYBE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE WHERE OUR DEPUTY SHERIFFS WOULD SHOW UP TO A CALL FOR SERVICE AT A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AT A HOUSE WHERE THERE WAS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AND FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE FIRST GET THERE WE DETAIN EVERYBODY AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S RESPONSIBLE AND DO SOME SEARCHING TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY HAS ANY WEAPONS. I GUESS IT'S A DYNAMIC SITUATION. THAT TRIGGERS A FORM WHEN WE DO THE SEARCH AT AT AT A DISPATCHED CALL FOR SERVICE. SO. THAT IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE BECAUSE OUR DEPUTY SHERIFFS HAVE NO DISCRETION WHEN THEY RESPOND TO A DISPATCH CALL FOR SERVICE. AS I JUST DESCRIBED. IT APPEARS BASED ON THE NUMBERS THUS FAR THAT IT'S TAKING ABOUT EIGHT FULL TIME EQUIVALENCY DEPUTY SHERIFFS AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY TO FILL OUT THOSE FORMS THAT WE'VE. COMPLETED THUS FAR THIS YEAR. ALONG WITH THE AUDITING PORTION OF THAT. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT AS WELL BECAUSE PART OF THE Là TALKS ABOUT NO UNIQUE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SHALL BE INCLUDED IN THE REFORM. AND NO PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE RIVER FORM ONE PREPARED BY OUR OFFICERS. SOLELY OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT INFORMATION IS IS NOT IN THAT FORM IN THE OPEN TEXT. WE'VE BEEN AUDITING ALL OF THOSE FORMS AND IT TAKES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A PERIOD OF TIME FOR OUR FOLKS TO LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO. UNIQUE IDENTIFYING INFORMATION OR PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION IN THOSE THREE NARRATIVE BOXES THAT ARE INCLUDED. IN THE FORM THAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF USING. SO BY THE ELIMINATION OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR DISPATCH CALLS FOR SERVICE IN GOING BACK TO JUST THE SELF INITIATED ACTIVITY WERE OUR FOLKS HAVE THE TRUE DISCRETION. WOULD SAVE ABOUT TWO FULL TIME EQUIVALENCY IN LOST PRODUCTIVITY AND WORK SO TWO DEPUTY SHERIFFS IN ESSENCE WOULD BE FREED UP TO DO OTHER THINGS. THEREFORE FREEING UP SOME FOLKS AND SAVE US SOME MONEY AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT. TALKED ABOUT ALREADY THIS MORNING IN THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT SAVING MONEY KEEPING COPS ON THE STREET SO ANY HELP IN THIS DIRECTION WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU YES SIR. MISTER MEMBERS BOATBUILDER ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY SAN MARINO AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THE TERM MEMBER SEAN UNDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. THIS IS YOUR MEMBERS CHORUS ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CELLS HILL. AS CHAIR ARRANGEMENT WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT LIZZIE BEACON WHAT THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA I'M PERSONALLY WE ARE HERE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB. ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN ON THE GOAL OF THE RACE ONE IDENTITY PROFILING ACT WAS TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUAL JUSTICE AND FAIRNESS IN OUR POLICING SYSTEM AND THAT REQUIRES COLLECTING AND REPORTING BASIC INFORMATION. ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT STOPS REGARDLESS OF HOW THOSE STOCKS WERE INITIATED -- I DO WANT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST THIS CLEAR AT THIS -- CHARACTERIZATION THAT THIS IS THAT AB ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WOULD BE A CLARIFICATION OF THE LAW -- THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE REP ABOARD. I DISCUSS THIS ISSUE OF WHETHER TO INCLUDE CALLS FOR SERVICE EXTENSIVELY. AND ULTIMATELY DECIDED THAT IT WOULD THAT EXCLUDING CALLS FOR SERVICE WOULD BE TOO BIG OF A CARVE OUT IT WOULD BE OVERLY BROAD IT WOULD NOT BE INCLUDING THE TYPE TO STOPS THAT. ARE MEANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THIS. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LIKEWISE IN THE REGULATIONS AGREED WITH THAT SPECIFIED THAT CALLS FOR SERVICE WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL AND AS A CO SPONSOR OF AB NINE FIVE THREE WAS ABSOLUTELY THE WITHIN THE INTENT OF OUR BILL -- SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO WAS IT IS OVERRIDE A DECISION THAT WAS MADE DELIBERATELY BY THE RIVER BOARD AND BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THERE'S EVEN A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE REPORT THAT IS DIVERT DEVOTED TO CALLS FOR SERVICE SO THIS IS ABSOLUTELY. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE BOARD -- AND I THINK THAT AB ONE FORTY SEVEN IS ALSO -- THEY'RE THERE TO MISCONCEPTIONS HERE SO THE FIRST IS THAT BECAUSE IN OFFICERS RESPONDING TO A CALL FOR SERVICE THAT THERE IS NO ROOM FOR DISCRETION. SO YES THEY HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE CALL FOR SERVICE BUT THE IS THIS. REPORT DOES NOT REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION OF EVERY ROUTINE CALLS FOR SERVICE IT IS ONLY WHEN A CALL FOR SERVICE IS EXTENDED. TO INCLUDE A STOP -- AND AT THAT POINT THERE ABSOLUTELY IS DISCRETION BY AN OFFICER AND SO IF. IF I WERE TO CALL IN A BURGLARY AN OFFICER COMES I AM ACTUALLY I AM FREE TO GO BUT THE IF THE OFFICER STOPS ONE OF MY NEIGHBORS WALKING BY. THAT IS WITHIN THEIR DISCRETION AND THAT IS A STOP AND SHOULD AND IS A PROPERLY -- CONSIDER TO STOP. AND SOMEONE CALLS THE POLICE TO SAY THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE'S A DRUG DEAL GOING ON IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD AND OFFICER A RESPONSE THAT SITUATION AND STOP SOME OF THE PEOPLE WALKING BY. THEY THEY HAVE DISCRETION AND IN DOING THAT AND THAT ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED. I HAVE THE SECOND. CONCERN IS THAT IF. THERE'S THIS IDEA THAT IT BECAUSE IN OFFICERS RESPONDING TO THIS CALL FOR SERVICE THAT THEY ARE NOT -- IN THAT BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THEIR DISCRETION WHETHER RESPOND OR NOT THAT IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE INCLUDED SO -- IN ADDITION TO WHAT I JUST WENT THROUGH ABOUT THE DISCUSSION THAT THEY ACTUALLY DO HAVE THERE IS. BIAS IN PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING POLICE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE REP ABOARD HAS RECOGNIZED THAT IS WHY THEY DESIGNATED THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON CALLS FOR SERVICE TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS CALLED BIAS BY PROXY. AND SO THAT IS WHERE STE YOU KNOW WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN THE NEWS RECENTLY WHERE PEOPLE CALL THE POLICE. ON PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DISTRUST OF OF PEOPLE THAT RACE OF PEOPLE WITHOUT APPEARANCE ETCETERA AND THAT IS UNFORTUNATELY AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF BIAS IN OUR POLICING SYSTEM AS AN IMPORTANT. CONTRIBUTOR TO THE RACIAL DISPARITIES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM AND SO RIVER WAS NOT JUST ABOUT -- BIAS BY OFFICERS IS ABOUT BIAS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF POLICING -- AND THAT A COUPLE POINTS I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT WE HEARD BEFORE SO ONE IS -- ABOUT THE BURDEN BECAUSE IT'S THAT SUCH A HIGH VOLUME OF OF CALLS ARE OF STOPS THAT ARE IN RESPONSE TO CALLS FOR SERVICE. THIS AS WAS DISCUSSED BY THE RIVER BOARD THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THIS NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT WAY THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND POLICE INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER. AND SAID ABSOLUTELY NEEDS TO BE INCLUDED A FOR GOING TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF HOW OUR SYSTEM IS BIASED -- AND SECOND -- AS I SAID BEFORE THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL CALLS FOR SERVICE IT IS ONLY WHEN THEY'RE EXTENDED AND A STOP TAKES PLACE. SO -- WE THINK THAT THIS IS BECAUSE FOR INCLUDING BECAUSE OUR SERVICE IS ABSOLUTELY WITHIN THE INTENT OF AB -- NINE FIVE THREE AND IS A VERY VERY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING BY CENTER SYSTEM. SEVEN WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. MEMBERS ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE ONE YES. I THINK MY MY FRUSTRATION BECAUSE OF THIS DISCRETIONARY DISCUSSION. SO LET ME JUST CLARIFY WITH YOU. WHEN AN OFFICER GETS CALLED TO A CIRCUMSTANCE. AND THEY ARRIVE ON SCENE. AND THEY WITNESSED WHAT THEY WERE CALLED. TO WITNESS YOU SAY THAT THEY HAVE DISCRETION TO DISMISS THAT. I KNOW THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND SO IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO ACT NO YES RIGHT AND ABSOLUTELY AND TO RESPOND TO TO A CALL FOR SERVICE. AND IF IT'S A SITUATION LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING AND THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE SHOWN IN THE ANALYSIS AND SO IT'S NOT. IT IS SO SO I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE ROUGH REFLECTED I THINK THIS IS WHAT HE'S GETTING AT THOSE THERE'S REALLY NOT. DISCRETION TO ACT THERE HAD TO CALL THE SERVICE AND THEIR VALIDATING WHAT THEY WERE CALLED TO THAT'S NOT A BLACK A PROACTIVE ENCOUNTER OF ANY SORT. AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE MONDAY TRAINERS BECAUSE THOSE PROACTIVE CAUGHT CONTACTS. THIS IS AN OBLIGATION TO ACT AND I DON'T THINK THAT INCLUDES DISCRETION. AND SO SOMETIMES A OFTEN AN OFFICER WILL WITNESS SOMETHING AND THEN WILL ACT ON THAT -- SOMETIMES AN OFFICER. HAS NOT WAS WITNESSED IT IS RESPONDING TO SOMETHING THAT THE CALLER HAS WITNESSED AND THEN THEY DO HAVE DISCRETION WITH ARE FROM MONCTON TO STOP -- I MEAN THIS IS. IT. IT IS INDICATED WHEN A STOP IS IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR SERVICE THAT IS PART OF THE DOCUMENTATION AND SO THOSE CAN BE EVALUATED SEPARATELY FROM OTHER. OTHER STOPS FOR THE DISAGREEMENT IS ON THE SLOW AS WHY IS THAT IN PART OF THE DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THERE. IT'S NOT DISCRETIONARY SO I THINK WE JUST DISAGREE ON THE NEED TO DOCUMENT THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible] BECKHAM. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THE PART OF OVER DOCUMENTING IS WHAT HAPPENS ABOUT STOP AS WELL RIGHT WHETHER RASTER KERR'S HOW FAR IS GONE AND THERE COULD BE DIFFERENCES IN HOW WE'RE TREATING FOLKS IN THOSE STOPS AND NOT MIGHT BE IN. THAT WOULD BE THE IMPORTANCE OF DOCUMENTING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. YES THAT'S CORRECT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSED OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO RESPOND A COUPLE A COUPLE OF THE POINTS MADE BY THE OPPOSITION RESPECTFULLY. THE LAW. AB NINE FIFTY THREE DOES NOT SAY THAT. US RECALLS FOR SERVICER STOPS IN THE AUTHOR HAS SAID THAT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENTION. THE REPORT DOES NOT. RIGHT STATE LAW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES NOT RIGHT STATE LAW WE'VE RIGHT STATE LAW. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CLARIFY. IF THIS IS A A QUESTION BEFORE US WHETHER OR NOT THOSE CALLS FOR STOPS. ARE ALL CALLS FOR SERVICE ARE INDEED STOPS. AND I I WANNA PUSH BACK ON SOMETHING ELSE HAS BEEN SAID WHICH IS THAT. OF THE THESE RIPPER PORTS. CAN BE USED TO TRY AND IDENTIFY BIAS IN CALLS FOR SERVICE THE INITIATION OF THOSE CALLS FOR SERVICE AND I REALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE THE OFFICER THAT RESPONSE IS THE ONE WRITING THE REPORT NOT THE PERSON WHO MADE THE CALL. IF THE PERSON THAT MADE THE CALL WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND MAYBE THAT WOULD GO TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT THE MOTIVATION BEHIND -- COLLECTING THESE REPORTS WHAT THE OFFICERS ARE NOT THE ONES INITIATING THIS THEY HAVE NO DISCRETION OVER THAT SO. I THINK WE NEED TO BALANCE THE COST OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFERS TO OFFICERS TO DO AGAINST THE POTENTIAL GOOD THAT WERE TRUCK TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND I THINK THAT THAT CALCULUS IS DIFFERENT ON CALLS FOR SERVICE THEN ON STOPS THAT THE OFFICERS THEMSELVES INITIATE AND YOU HEARD -- SHARE MCMAHON TESTIFIED THAT THIS IS COSTING JUST ONE COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA. THE EQUIVALENT OF TWO FULL TIME DEPUTIES EVERY YEAR. I AM NOT THE WHOLE ROOF -- JUST JUST THE THE RESPONSE TO CALLS FOR SERVICE I SUBMIT THAT THAT IS NOT A GOOD TRADE OFF AND NOT A GOOD USE OF OUR OFFICERS TIME SO I'D RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU END UP. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU ONE MORE PERSPECTIVE JUST FROM -- FROM FROM MY FROM MY NOSE JUST JUST. SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN AT THE END. OF A CALL AND I I FIND IT. FOUND IT. JUST A LITTLE DISTURBING THAT SEEM LIKE EVERY CALL THAT WOULD STOP BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE WERE THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT COMMITTED A CRIME TO LOOK A LOT LIKE ME. AND WHEN I A COUPLE TIMES WHERE I'VE GONE BACK TO CHECK. WE COULDN'T FIND A CALL. THAT IT WAS EVER MADE FOR THAT THERE WAS ANY SUSPICIOUS PERSON IN THE AREA SO I FIND THESE CALLS OR DOCUMENTING THIS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. SO THAT NOT ONLY WE CAN FERRET OUT ANY INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BIAS. BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT AS A WHOLE MAY HAVE BIAS. WE CAN FIND THAT OUT TOO AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO DOCUMENT SO WE CAN FERRET OUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE -- UNNECESSARY BY OF BIASES KILL BIASES. IN A LAWSUIT FROM SHOOTING SOMEONE. WILL PALE IN COMPARISON TO WHAT YOU'RE PAYING. TO DOCUMENT IT JUST ONE LAWSUIT COULD ULTIMATELY WIPE OUT A WHOLE COUNTY IF THE HIGH END OF LAWSUIT. AND SO IF YOU TALK ABOUT COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS -- I I WOULD SAY -- ELIMINATING LAW ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I I WILL CONTINUE TO SAY THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN I THINK THAT NUMBER'S CLOSER ONE PERSON I GET BEAT UP ABOUT IT. THEN. I BELIEVE 99% ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. BUT THAT ONE PERSON REALLY REALLY -- IS PROBLEMATIC AT 1% COULD BE VERY VERY VERY COSTLY AND WE NEED TO COME OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT WE ALSO NEED THE DATA. TO PROVE THAT AND SO UNFORTUNATELY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. IS THERE A MOTION [inaudible] LOW. ON A. B. ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER. CHEN SERRANO LACKEY. LACKEY FIVE BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN NO DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. CAN GENERAL OF NOW QUIRK. CANNELLA SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NO WICKS WICKS NOW. SORRY THAT MEASURE FAILS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MS EGGMAN. AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN ITEM NUMBER FOURTEEN SECOND. I THANK YOU I SEE EVERYBODY TODAY. I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH SIX WITH INCENTIVIZE COLLABORATIVE COURT PARTICIPATION. BY ADDRESSING ONE OF THE MOST CRIPPLING BARRIERS DEFENDANTS FACE WHEN TRYING TO RE INTEGRATE THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT BEING EXCESSIVE DEBT -- CLUB OF COURTS PROVIDE SOLID. RESULTS LOWER RECIDIVISM RATES IN MY COUNTY WE HAVE A THRIVING COLLABORATIVE COURT -- COMMUNITY AND WE SEE 20% THAT THE REDUCTION IN RECIDIVISM AS WELL AS SAVING ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER PERSON THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SERVE -- BECAUSE NOW IT SOMETIMES -- TO GO TO JAIL SOME MEMBERS ARE SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING THAT VERSUS CHOOSING TO GO TO THE CLUB OF COURT SO WHAT WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE JUDGES IN THIS IS THE ABILITY. TO ADD NINETEEN THE BASE FINE BUT HAVE SOME DISCRETION IN THE PILOT BUT FINDS THAT CAN OCCUR TO GET PEOPLE RE INTEGRATED AND AN END TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE OBSTACLES. THAT CONFRONT THEM THAT MIGHT MAKE. JAIL AN EASIER PATH WHEN WE KNOW THAT GETTING EVERYTHING CLEANED UP AND BACK ON TRACK IS THE WAY TO GO -- I'M VERY HONORED EVERY YEAR EVERY COUPLE YEARS US SOMEBODY FROM THE GEORGE SCHOOL LAW HAS AN IDEA FOR A BILL THAT THEY'VE BEEN WORKING ON I HIRED ONE OF MY STAFF WHO CAME TO ME A COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH AN IDEA AND THIS YEAR WE HAVE -- THIS IS ANOTHER BILL THAT SOME STUDENTS GOT TOGETHER AND SAY HOW CAN WE BETTER HELP US SERVE THE JUSTICE FOR EVERYBODY. IS WHEN THE IDEAS THEY CAME UP WITH -- SO WITH ME TODAY AS WE TRY TO INJECT JUSTICE AND DIGNITY INTO THE SYSTEM IS MARGO GEORGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AND STEVEN MAIER FROM THE MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW. YOU GO FIRST [inaudible] THE THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER EGGMAN SAID MY NAME IS STEVEN MYERS I'M A STUDENT AT MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW. I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES HOMELESS ADVOCACY PROJECT IN SUPPORT OF AB -- TEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THE PROJECT SUPPORTS AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CLIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CAN OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE -- HINDERED BY SUBSTANTIAL DEBT FROM PRIOR OFFENSES. THIS DEBT IS. A BARRIER TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY AFTER THEY HAVE COMPLETED A COLLABORATIVE COURT PROGRAM. PRACTICALLY THIS THAT MAKES EXPUNGEMENT OF THEIR CRIMINAL RECORDS IMPOSSIBLE MAKING IT HARDER TO FIND EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. AND EMOTIONALLY THE CONSTANT STRESS FROM DEBT COLLECTION -- FROM DEBT COLLECTORS SEEKING PAYMENT CAN OVERWHELM SOMEONE -- AND ACTUALLY UNTO THE PROGRESS THE PARTICIPANT MADE DURING THE COLLABORATIVE COURT PROCESS. SO WHILE COLLABORATIVE COURTS CONTINUE TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING COSTS AND RECIDIVISM RATES FOR THE COUNTIES THAT THAT USE THEM. THE COURTS POT THE THE COURTS POSITIVE IMPACTS WILL BE EVEN MORE SUBSTANTIAL IF PARTICIPANTS ARE POWER TO GRADUATE FROM THE PROGRAM. ABLE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE LIFE AHEAD RATHER THAN BEING DRAGGED DOWN BY THEIR PAST MISTAKES. AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN HELPS PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTIVELY WORKING ON OVERCOMING ADDICTION AND ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THROUGH COURT SUPERVISED TREATMENT BY REDUCING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THEIR SUCCESSFUL INTEGRATION. BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. CLS IS HOMELESS ADVOCACY PROJECTS STRONGLY SUPPORTS A. B. TEN SEVENTY SEVEN AND ASKS FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE I WAS DELIGHTED TO BE ASKED TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL IT IS SO HEARTENING TO SEE A BILL THAT PRIORITIZES INCENTIVES. BECAUSE THIS IS EVIDENCE BASED I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A STUDY YET THAT SHOWS AND THE OVERALL COLLABORATIVE COURTS HOW THIS WORKS. BUT WITH DRUG COURTS THERE'S A LONG BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT INCENTIVES WORK. IN FACT THEY WORK BETTER THAN SANCTIONS -- SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M THRILLED ABOUT AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN THERE'S A STUDY FROM THE NATIONAL DRUG COURT INSTITUTE. AND IT FOUND IN DRUG TREATMENT SETTINGS INCENTIVES OR REWARDS EITHER TANGIBLE OR INTANGIBLE. THAT POSITIVELY REINFORCE DESIRED BEHAVIORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECOVERY PROCESS. AND THE INCENTIVES BRING. THE BENEFITS OF ABSTINENCE FORWARD IN TIME INCENTIVES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO EFFECTIVELY INCREASE ABSTINENCE IMPROVE ATTENDANCE AND MOTIVATE TREATMENT ADHERENCE. THERE'S ALSO A MONOGRAPH FROM THE VIRGINIAN NATIONAL DRUG COURT INSTITUTE. IT'S LOCATED IN VIRGINIA IT'S THE NATIONAL CORD INSTITUTE. AND SAID MORE VALUABLE REWARDS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN LESS VALUABLE REWARDS BECAUSE VALUE IS DETERMINED BY THE RECIPIENT DRUG COURT SHOULD ASK PARTICIPANTS WHAT THEY SHOULD LIVE. IN CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT THINK OF A BETTER REWARD THAN RESTORING SOMEONE'S DRIVER'S LICENSE SO THAT THEY CAN BE EMPLOYED OR GO TO SCHOOL. SCHEDULE OF ESCALATING REWARDS IN WHICH THE VALUE OR NUMBER OF REWARDS INCREASES SYSTEMICALLY WAS SUCCESSFULLY LONGER PERIODS OF GOOD PERFORMANCE AND RESETS TO ORIGINAL LOW VALUE IF THE CLIENTS LOOKS UP. IS MOST EFFECTIVE AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN DOES THAT IF THE PERSON FEELS OUT OF THE COLLABORATIVE COURT PROGRAM THERE THEN -- HAVE THE SAME PROBLEMS THEY HAD BEFORE -- IS SAYS ALSO THE THING THAT'S REALLY BRILLIANT ABOUT AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN IS AND SEND THEM SHOULD BE DELIVERED IMMEDIATELY AND THE SETTING WHERE THE BEHAVIOR CARS. THE LONGER THE DELAY BETWEEN THE BEHAVIOR AND RESPONSE THE LESS EFFECTIVE THE INCENTIVE SO ANOTHER WORDS GIVING SOME AND AT THE OUTSET. OF THE PROGRAM THE REWARDS IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SAYING TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU COMPLETE THIS COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU THE REWARD -- AND THEN A SURPRISINGLY IS SAID THE STUDY FOUND THAT REWARDING PARTICIPANTS WERE DOING WELL ENOUGH ALREADY INTERNALIZED THE BENEFITS OF BEHAVIORAL CHANGE. MAY BE LESS EFFECTIVE THAN FOCUSING ON PARTICIPANTS WHO NEED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT SO THIS IS A EVIDENCE BASED. ON BILL THAT HAS A LOT OF SOLID RESEARCH BEHIND IT AT THIS POINT AND WE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JIM LIMBURG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. RESIDENTS ALSO ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SERVE AT SIMON MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW STUDENT AND PART OF LEGISLATION. AND PUBLIC POLICY CLINIC HERE ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT GEORGE COMMUNITY WILL SERVICES HOMELESS ADVOCACY PROJECT HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB. TEN SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] YEAH. I CERTAINLY OF BELIEVE THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED ALLOTTED. BUT REHABILITATION. THE DIFFICULTY IS BOUNCING BETWEEN COMPASSION ACCOUNTABILITY VERY VERY DIFFICULT. AND I JUST BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE WITHOUT GOING INTO A LONG EXPLANATION THAT THIS. TELLS A LITTLE. TOO MUCH AGAINST ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER IS REALLY -- IT IT'S A VERY VERY PERPLEXING DIFFICULTY BUT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE. PUBLIC SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE INTO THE DUTY THAT I HAVE ON THIS COUNCIL SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR POSITION MR LACKEY AND THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD ONLY DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY GET RID OF DEBT THIS GIVES THE JUDGE THE ABILITY TO EITHER WAVE THAT. PARTIAL WAY ROLE OBJET. SERVICE IN LIEU OF PAYMENT -- NOTHING OR A COMBINATION OF THE ABOVE SO IT DOESN'T JUST LIKE SAY IT'S ALL GONE -- IT ALSO DOESN'T JUST SAY YOU GET YOUR LICENSE BACK BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WORK WITH DMB IS NOT ALWAYS. THE EASIEST THING IN THE WORLD -- AMBER A WE'RE OPEN TO OTHER THINGS BUT THAT'S WHAT IT DOES IT JUST SAYS THAT THE JUDGE HAS THE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS IT DOESN'T SAY ABSOLUTELY MUST -- SO IT'S BUT CASE BY CASE A PROVIDING THAT -- THE WAY SO WITH ALL THAT SAID WE THINK THIS IS A A GREAT BILL IT TAKES ANOTHER STEP TOWARDS GETTING PEOPLE BACK ON TRACK AND RE INTEGRATED SOCIETY AND WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT. THAT INCLUDES ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND FURTHER WITH I THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ALL THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU THE DENTURES RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE WITH THE AMENDMENT. ON AB TEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. GEN SIR I LACKEY CONFLICTING INFORMATION -- LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAND I BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP [inaudible] KAMLAGER-DOVE. QUIRK AYE QUIRK I SAN DIEGO. SAN DIEGO I WICKS HI WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY LET AT LEAST MR KILEY A. B. SEVEN EIGHT SIX ITEM NUMBER [inaudible] THREE GOOD AFTERNOON. MOVE THE BILL. YOU MAY BEGIN. A GOOD MORNING -- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY SIX IS A VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE TO COMPLEMENT OTHER MEASURES THAT THIS -- LEGISLATURE'S TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN SEX TRAFFICKING THE BILL IDENTIFIES THE MOST EGREGIOUS FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INVOLVING SEX ACTS AND ADDS THEM TO LIST THE LIST OF CRIMES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE A VIOLENT FELONY. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING CRIMES IN THE WORLD AND TODAY'S DON'T RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR SOME STRICTER SENTENCING FOR THE MOST HORRIFIC HUMAN TRACK BEEN CRIMES. THAT OCCUR IN OUR STATE. IN SOME PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS DUE IN PART TO OUR COMPLEX ECONOMY AND OTHER FACTORS. IN -- 200-016-1000 THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE CASES OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING REPORTED IN CALIFORNIA AND OF THOSE CASES ONE THOUSAND FIFTY ONE WERE SEX GRAPH IN CASES. THAT WERE SEX TRAFFICKING CASES DESPITE THESE ALARMING NUMBERS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THIS IS A CRIME WITH VIOLENCE AT ITS CORE. HUMAN TRAFFICKING CRIMES ARE NOT CONSIDERED SERIOUS OR VIOLENT FELONIES UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. I THE RECENT CHANGES OTHER RECENT CHANGES TO THE LAW NOW I MANY OF THESE PERPETRATORS TO BE RELEASED AFTER SERVING ONLY HALF THEIR SENTENCE. THIS BILL WOULD RECOGNIZE THE MOST SERIOUS HUMAN TRAFFICKING OFFENSES AS A VIOLENT FELONY -- AND REQUIRE THAT THEY BE INCLUDED IN THE SPECIFIED CRIMES THAT MERIT SPECIAL CONSIDERATION ON A CALIFORNIA SENTENCING LAW. I JOINING ME TODAY IS WAS THAT SUITOR WHO IS A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND IN CHARGE OF THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT WITH THE EL DORADO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. CHAIRING COMMITTEE I I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND I AND I THINK SOMETIMES WHERE WE NEED TO START WITH THIS IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT IT IT TAKES IT'S THE MAJORITY OF CASES WITH HUMAN TRAFFICKING ARE. STEMMING FROM VICTIMS ARE PROSTITUTES YOU HAVE WOMEN YOUNG WOMEN YOUNG MEN BUT THE MAJORITY OF THEM ARE WOMEN THAT HAVE NO OTHER WAY TO GO BUT ON TO THE STREETS THERE BECAUSE THEY START OUT FROM THE FOSTER HOMES. THEY ARE WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THEIR SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE HORRIBLE CONDITIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN HOMES THEY AND OUT ON THE STREET WHERE THEY THEN BECOME VULNERABLE. TO A PIMP WHO THEN TURNS INTO A HUMAN TRAFFICKER SO WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE THAT IS SIMPLY PUMPING THEM BECAUSE THEY WOEFULLY GO INTO WANTING TO DO THE SEX ACTS. TO THE PERSON THAT THAT BECOMES HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THAT IS. VIOLENCE FORCE DURESS TO MAKE THEM DO THE SEX ACTS THAT THEY DO NOT WISH TO DO THAT THEY DO NOT WANT TO DO BUT THEY HAVE NO WAY OUT. THESE WOMEN ARE BEAT REPEATEDLY THEY ARE THREATENED THEY ARE -- HURT THEY ARE. FORCED TO DO THINGS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DO AND IT IS A REPETITIVE LIFESTYLE THAT THEY HAVE NO CHOICE. FOR THE REASON THAT I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE IT IS VIOLENT AT ITS VERY CORE IT IS VIOLENT SO WOMEN THAT ARE PROSTITUTES A YOU. YEARS AGO USED TO SAY OR NOT WE BUT THEY USED TO BE SO IT'S A VICTIMLESS CRIME NOBODY CARES AND I AND I SEE THE GREAT STRIDES THAT WE'VE MADE. IN SOCIETY AND IN CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY WITH ALL THE NEW LAWS TO HELP VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BUT WERE NOT ABLE TO HELP THEM IF WE CAN'T STOP THE CYCLE SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IS. IT IN JUST IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STUDY FROM SAN DIEGO COUNTY THERE EIGHT THOUSAND HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS ONLY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED EVEN REPORTED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE'S A REASON WHY THOSE NUMBERS ARE SO STAGGERING. AND IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST WITH DEALING WITH THE SYSTEM WHY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE PERSON THAT HAS THAT CONTROL AND THAT THEY ARE SO AFRAID OF FOR THEIR LIVES. WILL TURN AROUND AND BE RIGHT BACK OUT ON THE STREET IT TAKES A LOT OF TIME IT TAKES A LOT OF A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH -- THE THESE WOMEN. TO GET TO KNOW THEM FOR THEM TO TRUST US AND THEN ONCE THAT. TRUST IS RECEIVED. THEN TO TRY TO PROSECUTE AND THEY'RE TURNING AROUND AND COMING RIGHT BACK OUT WITHOUT HAVING TO SERVE THEIR FIRST SENTENCES AND THAT IS THE THE REASON FOR THE NEED FOR THE SPELL. WHAT IS HAPPENING IS I'VE HEARD A LOT OF THINGS TODAY ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS OF -- REFORM IN THE PRISON SYSTEMS AND ALL OF THAT IS GOOD AND THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF OTHER -- LAWS AND PROPOSITIONS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NO LONGER THREATS OR WHEN THEY HAVE REFORMED BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING AND IT IS REPEATEDLY HAPPENING AND I'M HEARING ABOUT IT UP AND DOWN THE THE STATE. AT DIFFERENT CONFERENCES THAT I ATTEND. THEY ARE STILL CONTROLLING THEY THE HUMAN TRAFFICKERS ARE STILL CONTROLLING THEIR VICTIMS FROM AND PRESENT THEY ARE STILL GETTING THAT CONTROL THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO THEM THEY ARE. COURSING THAN THEY ARE STILL HAVING THEM THEY'RE LIVING IN FEAR AND SO WHY WOULD YOU COOPERATE WORD ON THE STREET IS NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN. MANY LARGER COUNTIES ARE EVEN -- BECAUSE IT DOESN'T. IT'S VERY HARD TO WIN THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASE IF YOU HAVE ONE VICTIM BUT IF YOU HAVE TWENTY THAT IS VERY INVOLVED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENTS FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS AS WELL. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT WORKS TELLING A HUMAN TRAFFIC VICTIM IS. YES WE ARE SORRY THIS HAPPENED TO YOU BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AS A VIOLENT. THAT'S THE MESSAGE THAT'S BEING SENT AT THAT IS NOT ADDED -- TO IT BE CONSIDERED A VIOLENT FELONY AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. YES BRIEFLY MISS CHAIR MEMBERS RYAN CHARMER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION -- I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT OPPONENTS OF THE BILL HAVE ARGUED THAT CURRENT CRIMINAL PENALTIES ARE ADEQUATELY. HARSH AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO NEED -- TO STRENGTHEN THE PENALTIES -- ADDITIONALLY THEY THEY CLAIM THAT THERE'S SHOULD BE THERE WILL BE NO INCREASE IN THE DETERRENT EFFECT -- BY INCREASING -- THAT THESE PENALTIES AND WE WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT -- WE THINK THAT -- IF SOMEBODY IS CONVICTED AND IS GOING AWAY FOR A LOT LONGER -- THEN CURRENTLY -- THERE'S A 1100%. A SPECIFIC DETERRENTS FOR THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL. AND WE WOULD BELIEVE THAT IF THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT OUT ON THE STREET ACTIVELY -- ENGAGING -- IN THEIR OTHER ACTIVITIES THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE PHONE CALLS AND THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SEND NOTES BACK AND FORTH BUT THEY WOULDN'T PHYSICALLY BE OUT THERE -- BEING INVOLVED IN THE SAME HORRENDOUS CRIMES AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] ANY PUBLISHING. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEAN UNDER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- I THINK AGAIN AND AGAIN THIS COMMITTEE HEARS TESTIMONY ON BILLS THAT ARE ABOUT SOME CRIME THAT IS HAPPENING THAT THAT AND I THINK THAT WE ALL AGREE THEIR TERRIBLE CRIMES -- AND THEN THE BILL LOGICAL ARGUMENT IS THAT BY INCREASING THE PENALTY FOR THIS CRIME -- WE WILL SOMEHOW STOP IT OR AT LEAST PREVENT SOME INSTANCES OF IT FROM HAPPENING AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT THAT JUST ISN'T TRUE WE WE KNOW THAT INCREASING PENALTIES -- HAS HAS NO DETERRENT EFFECT AND I THINK THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS ALREADY SEVERELY PUNISHED UNDER EXISTING LAW THE LOWEST PENALTY UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IS FIVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON -- AND THE PUNISHMENT IN SOME CASES CAN BE LIFE IN PRISON AND THE INCREASE PRISON TIME RESULTING FROM MAKING THIS A VIOLENT FELONY AND A STRIKE WILL DO NOTHING TO FURTHER THAT THAT DETER THE CRIME -- I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING WAS SPECIFICALLY RAISED IN ARGUMENTS AGAINST PROP FIFTY SEVEN AS TO WHY THAT THAT PROPOSITION SHOULD NOT BE ENACTED. AND THE VOTERS APPROVED THE MEASURE HAVING HEARD THOSE ARGUMENTS THE VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHOICE THEY WERE MAKING WAS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO FOR THAT THIS STATE TO MOVE AWAY FROM OVER INCARCERATION AND EVER INCREASING PRISON COSTS. ON THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT BE GOING BACK ON THAT CHOICE. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. MARCO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I WOULD ECHO MISS YEARS COMMENTS. BUT I GUESS SOME ALSO PARTIALLY PUZZLED BY THIS BECAUSE I'M HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OF A MINOR WITH TO REST ON IS A LIFE SENTENCE IS FIFTEEN TO LIFE. AND BY DEFINITION OR LAID OUT IN SIX SIX SEVEN POINT FIVE OF THE OFFENSES THAT ARE VIOLENT FELONIES IS ANY OFFENSE THAT IS PUNISHABLE BY LIFE IN PRISON. SO THIS THAT PART OF THIS IS ALREADY -- A VIOLENT FELONYIT'S ALREADY A STRIKE IT'S NOT AN ISSUE. ON THE OTHER PARTS OF OF THE TWO THIRTY SIX POINT. ONE WHICH IS -- WHAT THEY SEEK TO MAKE A VIOLENT FELONY? IS PUNISHABLE -- EITHER BY FIVE EIGHT OR TWELVE YEARS IN STATE PRISON. OR EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS IN STATE PRISON. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY BODY OF EVIDENCE ANYWHERE THAT POSITS THAT FURTHER PRISON TIME IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE FORCED INTO THE SLIGHT. AND I THINK THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE DEVOTED TO INCARCERATING MORE PEOPLE NEED TO BE PUT TOWARDS. PREVENTION THEY NEED TO THERE NEEDS TO BE SHELTERS FOR RUN AWAYS THERE NEED TO BE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING. THERE NEED TO BE PLACES FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO OVER AND VIEWS OF SITUATIONS -- THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RESOURCES GO TO SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR NOTEBOOK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] HEARING NONE. YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WAS GRATEFUL -- THE COMMITTEE PASSED THIS EXACT BILL LAST YEAR AND I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE VOTE AT SEEMS ONE AGREEMENT THAT ON A THAT TRAFFICKING OF A MINOR SHOULD BE CONSIDERED VIOLENT FELONY I THINK IT'S ALSO A VIOLENT ACT -- WHEN IT'S TRACKING A PERSON OF ANY AGE -- SO I THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU AND OUT ON RECONSIDERATION FROM FROM LAST YEAR OF THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE -- REALLY BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THREE STRIKES AND JUSTICE DISK. YES UP HERE RIGHT. BOTH CAMPS AND HUMAN TRAPPER TRAFFICKERS I THINK THEY'RE EQUAL TO HIS LOW ONE FORCE NEAR THERE BUT THERE'S COMEDY ARTS WHAT THAT'S THAT'S WITHOUT. QUESTION -- I THINK TO SOME EXISTING LAWS THAT WE HAVE. TAKE CARE OF THAT WILL MOVE THAT BUT WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM OF THE YOUNG WOMEN AND MEN THAT ARE IN THIS SITUATION. WE NEED TO GET THEM HELP. AND WE NEED TO GET HIM HELP EARLY EARLIER IN SOONER -- AS I TALK TO INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN. THE BUSINESS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THEY TOLD ME PART OF THE SOLUTION MIGHT BE. OR SHOULD BE WE LOOKING AT NOT MAKING IT PROFITABLE FOR THEM AND THAT MAY BE GOING BACK AND LOOKING AT AT BANKRUPT EDIE'S INDIVIDUALS WHO GET INVOLVED IN THIS AND MAKING IT REALLY HARD TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THIS. IN ADDITION TO MAKING SURE WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE. ON AB SEVEN EIGHTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES ARE NO LACKEY. LACKEY I'VE BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE.
