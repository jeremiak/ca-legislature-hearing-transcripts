SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR-

00:20:39.338 --> 00:20:42.240

LAST LICENSING AUDIT WERE ACTUAL

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:49.000
NUMBERS SO. WE DID AN INITIAL

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:51.670
AUDIT AND- THAT INITIALIZE

00:22:51.737 --> 00:22:55.240
SHOWED THAT APPROXIMATELY 20% OF

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.775
THOSE AUDITED WERE OUT OF

00:22:56.842 --> 00:23:01.413
COMPLIANCE- WITHIN THIRTY DAYS.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.749
70% OF THE 20% CAME INTO

00:23:03.815 --> 00:23:06.585
COMPLIANCE SO NOW BUT I HAVE

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:07.352
BEEN ACTUALLY. OKAY MAY I

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:10.322
CLARIFY IS THAT YES YOU NOW YOU

00:23:10.388 --> 00:23:12.824
FIRST IDENTIFY 20% AND OF THE

00:23:12.891 --> 00:23:14.893
PEOPLE YOU IDENTIFIED. OF COURSE

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.095
AND THEY RESPONDED BUT THE YOU

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:17.996
KNOW YOUR TEST YOUR YOUR

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:22.534
SAMPLING 5% SO THAT MEANS THE

00:23:22.601 --> 00:23:24.636
OTHER 95% HOW DO GOOD IT ARE

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:26.104
THEY RESPONDING I GUESS THAT YOU

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:27.806

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:29.141
ARE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN IDENTIFIED

00:23:29.207 --> 00:23:30.809
SO HE CLEARLY DOES A BASELINE

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.310
PROBLEM WHEN YOU DO YOUR SAMPLE

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:35.480
5% AND 20% ARE DOING OR C.

00:23:35.547 --> 00:23:36.681
REQUIREMENTS. YEAH THAT'S A

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.650
SAMPLE OF- YOUR YOUR TOTAL

00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:41.119
POPULATION SO THAT MEANS. THE

00:23:41.186 --> 00:23:43.755
INDEXER CONCERNING THAT SO HIGH

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:47.225
IN YOUR SAMPLE. YES YES YES YES

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:49.027
SIR BUT IF I COULD SWIM WE HAVE

00:23:49.094 --> 00:23:50.195
A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT ISSUES

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:51.930
WHAT IS OKAY WE NEED ADDITIONAL

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:53.698
STAFFING TO CONDUCT THE C. ARTS.

00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:56.768
CURRENTLY WHEN YOU CONDUCT A C.

00:23:56.835 --> 00:23:58.770
ON IT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW 5% IS A

00:23:58.837 --> 00:23:59.905
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF YOUR

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:03.542
ENTIRE POPULATION THIRTY FIVE

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:05.076
THOUSAND. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:06.845
YOU KNOW AS PART OF BUILDING OUR

00:24:06.912 --> 00:24:08.246
FISCAL STRUCTURE AND MAKING SURE

00:24:08.313 --> 00:24:10.182
THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE TO

00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:12.384
CHOOSE- ADDRESS WORKLOAD WE ARE

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:15.387
LOOKING TO. AUGMENT OUR STAFFING

00:24:15.453 --> 00:24:17.923
SO THAT WE COULD PROVIDE SHE

00:24:17.989 --> 00:24:20.225
AUDITS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:22.561
WAYS THAT EVERYONE IN THE LIFE

00:24:22.627 --> 00:24:24.362
CYCLE OF DEVICES WOULD IT SIMPLY

00:24:24.429 --> 00:24:26.798
BE AUDITED. BUT I DID WANT TO

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.900
POINT OUT THAT. THE REASON THAT

00:24:28.967 --> 00:24:30.435
SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:33.038
OUT OF COMPLIANCE IT VARIES AND

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:35.273
I THINK IT HAD A LOT TO DO WITH.

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.609
THE WAY THAT OUR REGULATIONS ARE

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:38.410
WRITTEN THEY CAN BE SOMEWHAT

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:39.978
CONFUSING FOR INSTANCE MANY

00:24:40.045 --> 00:24:41.446
AUDIOLOGISTS AND SPEECH LANGUAGE

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:43.081
PATHOLOGIST OR TO A LICENSE

00:24:43.148 --> 00:24:46.518
HOLDERS. AND SOME AUDIOLOGIST-

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:48.286
HOLD A LICENSE THAT REQUIRES

00:24:48.353 --> 00:24:49.955
RENEWAL EVERY YEAR SO THERE WAS

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:51.590
SOME CONFUSION WHEN I ACTUALLY

00:24:51.656 --> 00:24:53.425
SPOKE TO THESE- THESE

00:24:53.491 --> 00:24:55.160
INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THEM

00:24:55.227 --> 00:24:57.662
COMPLETED THEIR OR- THEIR C. E.

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:58.763
BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT WITHIN

00:24:58.830 --> 00:25:01.266
THE- RENEWAL PERIOD. BUT INSTEAD

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:03.001
DID IT WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:05.036
WHAT ARE SOME OF THEM GOT THEIR

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:06.972
CD FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

00:25:07.038 --> 00:25:08.240
THINKING THAT IT WAS THAT MANY

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:10.108
OF OUR LICENSEES WORK IN THE

00:25:10.175 --> 00:25:11.843
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SOME OF THEM

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:13.178
THOUGHT THAT THEIR CD WAS

00:25:13.245 --> 00:25:15.080
ACTUALLY APPROVED CD ONLY TO

00:25:15.146 --> 00:25:17.082
FIND OUT THAT IT WASN'T. OR THEY

00:25:17.148 --> 00:25:19.317
TOOK SELF STUDY AND EXCEEDED THE

00:25:19.384 --> 00:25:21.286
AMOUNT OF SELF STUDY. SO A VERY

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:23.321
SMALL PORTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS

00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.956
THAT WE TALKED TO ACTUALLY JUST

00:25:25.023 --> 00:25:27.525
BLEW IT OFF AND ON AND I THINK-

00:25:27.592 --> 00:25:30.028
THE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WERE WERE

00:25:30.095 --> 00:25:31.596
CITED. OKAY AND GIVEN. I

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.131
APPRECIATE THAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:34.432
THERE'S SOME WORK TO DO TO

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:35.767
PERHAPS CLARIFY THE REGULATIONS

00:25:35.834 --> 00:25:37.435
AND EDUCATE THE LICENSEES SO

00:25:37.502 --> 00:25:39.437
THAT- THEY CAN BE IN COMPLIANCE

00:25:39.504 --> 00:25:41.439
RIGHT. OKAY AND THEN ACTUALLY

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.408
JUST THE ISSUE NUMBER ELEVEN

00:25:43.475 --> 00:25:47.045
THAT'S IT THE- MAY NOTE THAT-

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.246
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE EXPLICIT

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:49.514
AUTHORIZATION TO DISCIPLINE

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:53.151

00:25:53.218 --> 00:26:01.760

PATHOLOGISTS IT'S DEFINITELY

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.046
THOUGHT NATIONALLY AND EVEN MORE

SETTINGS REPORT AT THEIR JOB

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:26.958
OPENINGS ALWAYS EXCEED THE

00:30:27.025 --> 00:30:29.661
NUMBER OF JOB SEEKERS- KNOWING

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.462
THAT THIS IS DUE TO IT TWO

00:30:31.529 --> 00:30:33.031
DIFFERENT MAINLY TO DIFFERENT

00:30:33.097 --> 00:30:35.433
FACTORS- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.002
THAT I'M PART OF IT IS THAT A

00:30:38.069 --> 00:30:39.170
LIMITED NUMBER OF GRADUATE

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:42.273
SCHOOL OPENINGS. AND THE OTHER

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:43.875
ASPECT IS INCREASED NEED FOR

00:30:43.942 --> 00:30:46.444
SERVICES AND AS MENTIONED WE

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:48.746
PROVIDE SERVICES ACROSS THE AGE

00:30:48.813 --> 00:30:51.015
SPAN SO YOU HAVE GROWTH IN THE

00:30:51.082 --> 00:30:54.152
AREA OF- CHILDREN BEING SEEN IN

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.454
DIAGNOSED AT YOUNGER AGES SO WE

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.356
HAVE A LOT OF EARLY INTERVENTION

00:30:58.423 --> 00:31:00.091
SERVICES- INCREASES AND ARTISAN

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:02.160
WHICH WERE. AWARE OF EACH AND

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:03.494
THEN INCREASES IN OUR AGING

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:06.097
POPULATION WITH DEMENTIA

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:09.701
STROKES- SWALLOWING DISORDERS-

00:31:09.767 --> 00:31:11.069
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE IN

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:13.938
CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:16.407
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND

00:31:16.474 --> 00:31:19.043
THAT WITH THE NEED FOR BILINGUAL

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.511
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGISTS FAR

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:24.382
ACTS OUT AT EXCEEDS ON ANY WE

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:27.819
CAN SUPPLY- END IN ADDITION OUR

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:29.554
ROLE IN SCHOOLS WHERE THE

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:30.955
MAJORITY OF OUR SPEECH LANGUAGE

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:35.226
PATHOLOGISTS WORK- ART OUR- OUR

00:31:35.293 --> 00:31:37.161
SCOPE OF PRACTICE HAS EXPANDED

00:31:37.228 --> 00:31:39.330
OVER THE YEARS WE'RE NOT. JUST

00:31:39.397 --> 00:31:41.299
PULLING KIDS OUT INTO A CLINICAL

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:43.334
ROOM WE'RE WORKING IN THE

00:31:43.401 --> 00:31:45.370
CLASSROOMS WERE SUPPORTING TEAMS

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.739
THAT ARE WORKING WITH KIDS- EVEN

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:57.548
INCH- GENERAL EDUCATION- SO. AS

00:31:57.615 --> 00:31:58.583
OUR EYES ARE WORKING. THE ANSWER

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.318
IS ARE WE CLOSING ARE STRETCHED

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:02.587
THEN- I KNOW INTO OF END A

00:32:02.654 --> 00:32:03.554
QUESTION ABOUT- HOW WE'RE

00:32:03.621 --> 00:32:05.790
SOLVING IS. I IT'S A KIND OF

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:07.392
DANCE OF COURSE- ONE THING I

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:08.693
PERSONALLY INVOLVED WITH IS

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.763
LOOKING AT AT AT ELIGIBILITY- IN

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:13.598
CASE LOAD WORKLOAD ISSUES TO

00:32:13.665 --> 00:32:15.933
MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE WORKING

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.236
AT THE TOP OF OUR FIELD MAKING

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.038
SURE THAT AGAIN WE'RE NOT JUST.

00:32:20.104 --> 00:32:21.673
PULLING KIDS IN FOR DIRECT

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:23.174
TREATMENT ALL THE TIME THAT THE

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:24.876
MORE PEOPLE WILL BE IMPACTED

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:28.246
THROUGH- TEAM TRAININGS USING

00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:29.247
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.182
ASSISTANTS EFFICIENTLY ALL OF

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:33.551
THOSE WAYS ARE GOING TO HELP US-

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:34.952
BE MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE

00:32:35.019 --> 00:32:36.888
IN OUR SERVICES. AT THE SAME

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:39.657
TIME I KNOW THAT UNIVERSITIES

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:42.627
ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON- TRYING

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:47.432
TO INCREASE. IT TO INCREASE THE

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:48.266
PROGRAMS. I'D LIKE TO ALSO ADD

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.368
THAT LAST YEAR THE- CHANCELLOR

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:52.003
OF THE CALIFORNIA- STATE

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.839
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM DID GET. A

00:32:54.906 --> 00:32:56.040
THREE MILLION DOLLAR GRANT TO A

00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:57.375
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AND SPEECH

00:32:57.442 --> 00:32:59.844
PATHOLOGY MASTER'S PROGRAMS TO

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.713
TRY TO INCREASE OUR THE

00:33:01.779 --> 00:33:03.281
ENROLLMENT. AND SO IN OUR

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:04.882
PARTICULAR PROGRAM WHERE I AM

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.918
HONORED TEACH- WE WERE ABLE TO

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:08.319
GO FROM THIRTY TWO GRADUATE

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.355
STUDENTS TO FIFTY- SPEECH

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.989
PATHOLOGY GRADUATE STUDENTS BUT

00:33:12.056 --> 00:33:14.759
ONCE THOSE FUNDS ARE. ARE AND-

00:33:14.826 --> 00:33:16.661
YEAH COMPLETE ERROR ARE USED AS

00:33:16.728 --> 00:33:18.563
THEN WE'RE BACK TO OUR THIRTY

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:20.565
TWO THIS YEAR FOR EXAMPLE. THE

00:33:20.631 --> 00:33:22.867
OTHER ISSUE FOR AG PROGRAMS IS

00:33:22.934 --> 00:33:25.903
THAT. THEY THEY ONLY TAKE IN

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:29.607
ABOUT TEN TO TWELVE EIGHTY

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.875
STUDENTS PER COHORT. BECAUSE OF

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.610
THE WAY THE MODEL WORKS IS ONCE

00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.379
YOU COMPLETE DIDACTIC SEAT THEN

00:33:34.445 --> 00:33:36.180
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT AND DO KIND

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.950
OF LIKE A RESIDENCY. AND THAT

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.752
REQUIRES PLACEMENTS IN PUBLIC

00:33:40.818 --> 00:33:42.353
FACILITIES HOSPITALS CLINICS AND

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:45.223
SO ON. AND THOSE ARE LIMITED AND

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:46.824
WHERE WE CAN PLACE THEM SO WE

00:33:46.891 --> 00:33:48.659
CAN'T BE TAKING IN COHORTS OF

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:50.461
FORTY STUDENTS EVEN THOUGH THERE

00:33:50.528 --> 00:33:51.462
IS THAT KIND OF INTEREST OUT

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.398
THERE- THERE'S JUST NO WHERE TO

00:33:53.464 --> 00:33:54.599
PLACE THEM LATER AND THAT'S TRUE

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:56.801
FOR SPEECH PATHOLOGY AS WELL. SO

00:33:56.868 --> 00:33:58.236
WE'RE LIMITED IN HOW MANY WE CAN

00:33:58.302 --> 00:34:00.671
TAKE- SO STUDENTS WORK ARE

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:02.273
CREATIVE AND THEY END UP AND

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.341
GOING TO OTHER STATES IF

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.543
NECESSARY OR TAKING LONGER OR

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.746
WHATEVER THEY HAVE TO DO- NOW

00:34:08.813 --> 00:34:10.148
THIS MAY SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.016
BUT- WE HAVE WE USED TO HAVE

00:34:12.083 --> 00:34:13.217
NINE MASTER'S PROGRAMS AND

00:34:13.284 --> 00:34:14.952
IDEOLOGY IN THE STATE. AND NOW

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:17.622
WE HAVE FIVE C. AS YOU PROGRAMS

00:34:17.688 --> 00:34:19.724
AND ONE PRIVATE AND ONE YOU SEE

00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:23.227
A RELATED PROGRAMS- WE COULD USE

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:26.330
MORE PROGRAMS. ED SO THAT WE CAN

00:34:26.397 --> 00:34:27.965
BE GRADUATING A FEW MORE PEOPLE

00:34:28.032 --> 00:34:30.468
EVEN IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO

00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:33.337
NEVADA OR OHIO TO GET THERE AND

00:34:33.404 --> 00:34:33.971
THEIR CLINICAL HOURS. I'LL DO

00:34:34.038 --> 00:34:39.143
THAT AND THEN I'LL COME. BACK TO

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.311
CALIFORNIA TO SERVICE PUBLIC.

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:41.779
WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE NUMBER WE

00:34:41.846 --> 00:34:43.014
NEED TO CAN. TO SURE THE THIS

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.049
ISSUES HAVE THE FUNDING FOR

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.050
THIS- BUT NUMBER TWO MY QUESTION

00:34:46.117 --> 00:34:48.085
IS ABOUT. DOING THERE THE TIME

00:34:48.152 --> 00:34:50.054
LIKE AN INTERNSHIP OR WHATNOT.

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:51.322
CAN IT NOT BE DONE AT OUR

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.623
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS ARE HIGH

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:56.027
SCHOOLS. OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:58.696
DONE I DID MINE IN AN ELEMENTARY

00:34:58.763 --> 00:34:59.564
SCHOOL SO WE HAVE LOTS OF

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.799
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AND HIGH

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:03.634
SCHOOLS UP AND DOWN THE STATE

00:35:03.701 --> 00:35:06.270
BUT IT IS- MAY THERE BE A NEW

00:35:06.337 --> 00:35:08.339
REQUIREMENT NOW. KNOW WHAT I

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:10.374
THINK OF LIKE LITTLE- AND THIS

00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.176
CASE OR SPEAK TO THAT BUT I

00:35:12.243 --> 00:35:13.077
THINK I THINK THOSE ARE

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:14.712
CERTAINLY BIBLE INFUSED OPTIONS

00:35:14.779 --> 00:35:19.250
AT THIS TIME. YES- THE THERE ARE

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.586
PLENTY OF PLACES AS YOU SAID-

00:35:21.652 --> 00:35:24.155
ACROSS ALL THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:35:24.222 --> 00:35:26.791
Q. YOU SHOULD DO YOUR REQUIRED

00:35:26.858 --> 00:35:28.092
PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE HERE

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:31.262
YOUR INTERNSHIP HERE- HOWEVER I

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:32.763
HAVE SUPERVISION MUST BE

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:35.233
PROVIDED EIGHT HOURS A MONTH FOR

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.768
ANYBODY IN THAT DURING THAT YEAR

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.971
SO THAT'S ONE CONSIDERATION. THE

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:42.340
OTHER THING IS FOR THOSE THAT

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:45.276
ARE- WANTING O- WORK IN THE

00:35:45.343 --> 00:35:48.379
MEDICAL FIELD. IT CAN BE MUCH

00:35:48.446 --> 00:35:52.583
MUCH HARDER TO FIND- INTERNSHIPS

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.753
BECAUSE THEY- AND MEDICAL STAFF

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.922
GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE. THE

00:35:57.989 --> 00:36:00.791
CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.693
AS READILY AS A SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.663
WHERE- IN ONE. WAY THAT A LOT

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:07.265
OF- INTERNS DEAL WITH THIS IS

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:08.733
THEY DO THEIR INTERNSHIPS IN

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.268
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LATER ON TO

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.737
SWITCH OVER TO MEDICAL- IN THEIR

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:14.939
PRACTICE BUT IDEALLY THAT IS NOT

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:17.174

OF SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY.

00:36:39.931 --> 00:36:41.232
THE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE

00:36:41.299 --> 00:36:43.534

OBSERVATION BACK TO THE TO THE

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:52.763
LAST POINT I THINK WHEN WE

CONTINUE TO SEE THE SAME ISSUE

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.268
WELL WE HAVE REALLY ENCOURAGED

00:43:58.335 --> 00:43:59.403
INCREASED ENROLLMENT AND R. C.

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.572
ISSUES OFTEN TIMES IT HAS

00:44:01.638 --> 00:44:02.639
RESULTED. IN THE DETERIORATION

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.375

WE GO BACK INTO THE PROCESS

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.388

DESIGNER TITLE OUT TO DO SO IS

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:34.957

01:01:35.024 --> 01:01:35.892
FURTHER FRUSTRATION TO

THAT PATH OF BUSINESS BUT DATE

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.583

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:09.358
COMMERCIAL WENT BACK TO

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.194
RESIDENTIAL WHEN THERE WAS A-

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:13.062
RECESSION PREVIOUSLY IT WAS THE

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:15.331
OPPOSITE THERE WAS A LOT OF

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:15.898
RESIDENTIAL WORK SO PEOPLE

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:17.500

LEGISLATION. INITIALLY IT WAS

01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:35.518
BECAUSE- OF THE ISSUE OF SAFETY

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:36.786

OUR POLICIES MAY CHANGE THE ONLY

01:03:24.033 --> 01:03:25.935
WAY TO CHANGE THIS IS TO

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.249
TO SAY THE TWO EXAMS ARE THE

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:45.300
WHICH WHILE THE STATE DOES CARRY

01:21:45.367 --> 01:21:46.935
MANY SIMILARITIES. THE STATE OF

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:48.103

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.672
UTILIZE THE AIRY BUT NOT THE

IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. I WILL

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:03.885
CONCLUDE JUST BY SAYING THAT

01:22:03.952 --> 01:22:05.420
THESE FACTS FOR OUT A SIMPLE

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.689

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:15.030
REGULATE THE PROFESSION OF

HOWEVER THE STRATEGY NOT

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.229
QUANTIFY THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:03.297
BE SPENT ON EACH TOPIC FOR

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:07.101

SCHOOL TO DETERMINE AND

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.051
IMPLEMENT IS WHY WE PROBABLY

01:40:24.118 --> 01:40:25.619

STANDARDS- AND IF IT'S

01:40:29.189 --> 01:40:30.758
DETERMINED THAT EDUCATIONAL

CONTRACTOR ONE OF THE ISSUES MAY

01:41:07.628 --> 01:41:08.629
BE WHETHER OCCUPATIONAL

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:09.963
ULTIMATELY MAYBE WHETHER

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.332
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS ARE

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:13.367
ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN AN

01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:15.269
INDEPENDENT. BUSINESS AND I WAS

01:41:15.335 --> 01:41:17.004
SO SORT OF FASCINATED BY THE

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:19.006
BACKGROUND PAPER DISCUSSION

01:41:19.072 --> 01:41:20.240
ABOUT THE PROFESSIONAL

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:24.478
CORPORATION ACT AND THE APPARENT

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:26.480
STATUS WHICH IS THE-

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:29.049
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS ARE NOT

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:31.351
PRESENTLY AUTHORIZED TO FORM. A

AS TO REASON FOR THAT LIMITATION

01:41:38.392 --> 01:41:41.495
AND- ONE AND TWO GIVEN THE

01:41:41.562 --> 01:41:43.464
LIMITATION WHAT ACTION ARE WE

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.365
ENGAGED IN TO TRY TO FIX THAT

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:46.900
BECAUSE IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.902
THAT WOULD BE. SOMETHING THAT AT

01:41:48.969 --> 01:41:51.338
LEAST SOME OCCUPATIONAL

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:52.339
THERAPISTS MIGHT BE INTERESTED

01:41:52.406 --> 01:41:55.509
IN- THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIRMAN

01:41:55.576 --> 01:41:57.311
SO. WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT IT

01:41:57.377 --> 01:41:59.046
AS A FULL BOARD BECAUSE IT

01:41:59.112 --> 01:42:00.247
HASN'T COME UP FOR DISCUSSION-

01:42:00.314 --> 01:42:01.949
BUT SEEING THE DYNAMICS

01:42:02.015 --> 01:42:04.284
OPERATIONS LESS. COURT

01:42:04.351 --> 01:42:06.019
INFORMATION THE BACKGROUND PAPER

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.689
CERTAINLY BECAUSE- AN INTEREST

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:10.324
IN US TO REVISIT THIS FOR FUTURE

01:42:10.390 --> 01:42:12.092
FOR DISCUSSION HOWEVER WHAT I

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:14.094
CAN SAY IS THAT THERE ARE

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:15.462
SEVERAL BUSINESS MODELS OUT

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:17.798
THERE THAT SUPPORT. OTC

01:42:17.865 --> 01:42:19.366
FUNCTIONING AS INDEPENDENT

01:42:19.433 --> 01:42:21.468
CONTRACTORS AND THEY- WE DON'T

01:42:21.535 --> 01:42:23.537
KNOW TO WHAT EXTENT DO WE TALK

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:24.905
TO SUPPORT HOW THEY ALIGN OR

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:27.841
THEY DIFFER SO MUCH FROM- THE

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.710
I'M SORRY THE OPERATIONS FROM.

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:31.912
ARMS DYNAMICS SHE'S MADE UP TO

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.847
LOOK AT THAT HERE SO WE DO LOOK

01:42:33.914 --> 01:42:35.582
FORWARD TO REVISITING NOT

01:42:35.649 --> 01:42:36.617
HOWEVER- THE INDEPENDENT WE

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:38.318
HAVEN'T SEEN IT COME UP AS A

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.987
CONCERN YET- EITHER PRACTICE

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:43.190
ISSUE OR ENFORCEMENT ISSUE- WHAT

01:42:43.257 --> 01:42:45.158
WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS HAVE A

01:42:45.225 --> 01:42:46.260
CONVERSATION AND SEE WHAT THAT

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.060
LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF

01:42:47.127 --> 01:42:48.161
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY BUSINESS

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:51.832
MODELS. AND THE POTENTIAL OF

01:42:51.899 --> 01:42:55.602
BEING LISTED UNDER YOUR S. WELL

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:56.537
OBVIOUSLY IT'S ATTRACTIVE TO

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:58.472
OTHERS. OTHERS IN THE HEALTHCARE

01:42:58.539 --> 01:43:00.140
INDUSTRY AND I CAN'T IMAGINE

01:43:00.207 --> 01:43:01.508
THAT IT WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:03.076
SOME OF. THE OCCUPATIONAL

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:05.012
THERAPISTS THAT ARE REGULATED

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:07.948
BY. YOUR BOARD SO I SUGGEST YOU

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.783
DO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. BECAUSE

01:43:09.850 --> 01:43:11.418
SEPARATE AND APART FROM YOUR

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:15.622
ACTIVITIES OF NFORCEMENT. AND

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:16.256
OTHERWISE THEY'RE PROBABLY SOME

01:43:16.323 --> 01:43:17.824
VERY- THERE'S SOME AND- SIR TO

01:43:17.891 --> 01:43:19.159
INCORPORATE IS AND HAVE A

THERE ARE OTHER. CERTAINLY OTHER

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:24.031
MODELS THAT EXIST I ASSUME- FOR

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:26.166
OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS BEYOND

01:43:26.233 --> 01:43:28.702

01:43:36.143 --> 01:43:39.112
THOSE- THAT WERE NOT THERE

01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:40.948
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SOME ISSUES

01:43:41.014 --> 01:43:42.349
THAT WERE RAISED DURING THE LAST

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:44.451

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.346
THE WAY OF COMMENT ABOUT WHAT

THINK THE MAIN ANSWER YOU GAVE

01:45:35.429 --> 01:45:36.830
WAS WELL WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:45:36.897 --> 01:45:38.832
INCREASING OUR FEES AGAIN AND

01:45:38.899 --> 01:45:41.835
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT MAYBE

01:45:41.902 --> 01:45:42.936
YOU DON'T HAVE MANY OTHER

01:45:43.003 --> 01:45:44.905

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.775
OF OTHER BOARDS. YEAH WHAT'S THE

01:45:48.842 --> 01:45:50.210
IMPACT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.245
JUSTICE'S FEE INCREASES ON YOUR

DCA PROGRAM THE COST. GOING UP

01:45:58.085 --> 01:46:00.554
AS WELL. AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE

01:46:00.620 --> 01:46:03.590
AGAIN THAT- YOU KNOW THESE THESE

01:46:03.657 --> 01:46:05.692
FEE INCREASES OUR BURDENS ON THE

01:46:05.759 --> 01:46:07.127
ON THE ON THE PROFESSIONALS-

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:08.562
PROVIDING SERVICES AND WILL

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.397
CERTAINLY IN A SENSE THAT

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:12.566
LICENSING FEE SHOULD. SUPPORT

01:46:12.632 --> 01:46:15.168
THE COST OF- OF THE LICENSING

01:46:15.235 --> 01:46:17.938
ACTIVITY- I THINK WE REALLY ALSO

01:46:18.004 --> 01:46:19.239
NEED TO SCRUTINIZE WHEN

01:46:19.306 --> 01:46:20.173
LICENSING BOARDS ARE BEING

01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.442
CHARGED BY OTHER AGENCIES ARE

01:46:22.509 --> 01:46:24.177
THOSE CHARGES IN LINE WITH THE

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:25.912
ACTUAL COSTS OR THEY ACTUALLY

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:27.714
END UP BEING FUND TRANSFERS.

01:46:27.781 --> 01:46:29.916
FROM FROM FROM BASICALLY

01:46:29.983 --> 01:46:31.485
LICENSEES TO SUPPORT OTHER

01:46:31.551 --> 01:46:34.321
AGENCIES. AND AGAIN I WOULD JUST

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.256
MAKE NOTE I KEEP THAT RIGHT BUT

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:38.458
IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE DOJ

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:39.793
COSTS THAT. NO WE'RE WE'RE

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.595
PAYING WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK UP

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:43.296
FROM COLLEGE ARE WHAT THE SALARY

01:46:43.363 --> 01:46:45.932
IS OF DIFFERENT- PROFESSIONALS

01:46:45.999 --> 01:46:47.667
LAWYERS LEGAL YOU KNOW LEGAL

01:46:47.734 --> 01:46:49.703
AIDES AT CETERA. AND YET WE

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:50.904
CALCULATE THE FEES AND YOU

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:55.142
FIGURE OUT THE HOURLY RATE AND

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:56.810
MATH. I MEAN THE ACTUAL CHARGES

01:46:56.877 --> 01:46:58.178
MANY FULL THAT NIGHT I REALIZE

01:46:58.245 --> 01:46:59.846
THERE MAY BE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:01.081
COSTS OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:02.816
BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A HUGE

01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:04.151
DIFFERENCE AND THAT IS ALL NOW

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:06.486
BEING BORNE BY. THE LICENSEES

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:07.120
AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD OF COURSE

01:47:07.187 --> 01:47:08.855
OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE- YOU KNOW

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.891
WHETHER IT'S A LAWSUIT OR OTHER

01:47:10.957 --> 01:47:13.193
TYPES OF THINGS WHERE. IT'S NOT

01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.928
THE FAULT THE LICENSEE YET THE

01:47:14.995 --> 01:47:16.329
LICENSEES BEARING THE COST THE

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:17.130
JUST BEING PASSED ON TO

01:47:17.197 --> 01:47:19.332
LICENSEES. SO I GUESS THE

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:20.400
QUESTION AND MAYBE IT'S NOT SO

01:47:20.467 --> 01:47:22.068
MUCH A QUESTION YOU CAN ANSWER

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:23.770
IS THAT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:27.574
YOUR STRUCTURAL DEFICIT- IS THAT

01:47:27.641 --> 01:47:30.076
WHAT. WHAT THE WHAT THE WHAT IS

01:47:30.143 --> 01:47:32.546
YOUR BOARD SEE IN TERMS OF THE

01:47:32.612 --> 01:47:34.314
ADDITIONAL BURDENS BEING PLACED

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:35.949
JUST BECAUSE OF THESE YOU KNOW

01:47:36.016 --> 01:47:37.584
FEEDING THESE INCREASES THE

01:47:37.651 --> 01:47:40.754
CHARGES TO YOU. BY DOJ ARE R. D.

01:47:40.821 --> 01:47:45.425
C. A. AND ARE YOU LOOKING AT

01:47:45.492 --> 01:47:46.860
WAYS TO BETTER ME. YOU USED TO

01:47:46.927 --> 01:47:48.628
THOSE LEGAL SERVICES SO FORTH

01:47:48.695 --> 01:47:49.930
TRY TO REDUCE THE COST ON THE

01:47:49.996 --> 01:47:51.164
LICENSEES. AND TERMS OF MANAGING

01:47:51.231 --> 01:47:53.333
IT AND THEN CERTAINLY I THINK

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.701
IT'S OUR ROLE TO PERHAPS ASKING

01:47:54.768 --> 01:47:56.102
QUESTIONS AND- SAY THAT IS THIS

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:57.170
A REASONABLE CHARGE TO BE PASSED

01:47:57.237 --> 01:47:59.306
ON TO LICENSEES. YEAH I THINK I

01:47:59.372 --> 01:48:00.140
SHOULD ALSO MAY NOTICE IS THAT

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.008
THERE'S A LICENSEE MYSELF AND

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:03.076
ANOTHER BOARD. THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:04.978
DID AT LEAST AT THE FEDERAL

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:06.546
LEVEL- WHEN THEY PASSED IT. THE

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:08.014
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS PASSED THE

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:10.951
TAX TAX CHANGES- YOU KNOW WE CAN

01:48:11.017 --> 01:48:12.552
NO LONGER DEDUCT LICENSING FEES

01:48:12.619 --> 01:48:14.554
AS PART OF OUR OUR IN INDIA.

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:16.289
WHERE TAXIS AND NOW ALSO IN OUR

01:48:16.356 --> 01:48:18.692
OFFER INCOME TAX SO- IF YOU'RE

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:19.893
IF YOU'RE WORKING YOU KNOW YOU

01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:22.195
CAN'T DEDUCT AS EXPENSES ANYMORE

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:23.663
SO THAT'S SORT OF ANOTHER

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.165
PERSONAL FEEDING TREES. TO YOUR

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:27.033
OWN PERSONAL FINANCES YOU PUT A

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:29.769
REPAIR FOR YOUR LICENSE. SO SO

01:48:29.836 --> 01:48:31.371
AGAIN JUST HAVING THESE LICENSE

01:48:31.438 --> 01:48:33.540
FEES GO UP AND UP AND UP WITHOUT

01:48:33.607 --> 01:48:35.108
MORE RATIONALE THIS IS CERTAINLY

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:37.210
VERY CONCERNING. SO PERHAPS- CAN

01:48:37.277 --> 01:48:38.578
YOU JUST MAYBE BRIEFLY TOUCH ON

01:48:38.645 --> 01:48:40.447
WHAT IS THE BOARD TRYING TO DO

01:48:40.513 --> 01:48:42.849
TERMS OF MANAGING THE- ROTATED

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:44.517
DEGREE LET'S SAY THE DOJ COSTS

01:48:44.584 --> 01:48:45.886
AND TRYING TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:48.321
OF- SERVICES YOU NEED TO. USE

01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.156
YOUR YOU NEED TO USE SOME DOJ TO

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:55.228
TRY TO MATCH THE DECREASE THE-

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:56.062

RECOGNIZE THAT CERTAINLY- A

01:49:09.776 --> 01:49:11.478
COMMUNICATION UP FRONT AND A

01:49:11.544 --> 01:49:13.113
LITTLE BIT MORE IN ADVANCE I

01:49:13.179 --> 01:49:14.881
WOULD HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW BETTER

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:17.217
FOR BOARD. OPERATIONS AS

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:18.151
MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:19.986
HEARINGS WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM

01:49:20.053 --> 01:49:22.188

ARE GETTING TO THE MAX. I'M IN

01:49:28.929 --> 01:49:30.630
TERMS OF MANAGING IT. THE BOARD

01:49:30.697 --> 01:49:32.165
REALLY DOES TAKE A CAREFUL LOOK

01:49:32.232 --> 01:49:34.334
AT- DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT.

01:49:34.401 --> 01:49:37.337
A VIOLATION REACHES THE LEVEL OF

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:40.340
REQUIRING. THAT CASE BE REFERRED

01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:41.775
TO THE AG'S OFFICE OR IF IT'S

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:42.943
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE HANDED

BY ISSUING A CITATION FINE- IN

01:49:47.347 --> 01:49:49.616
TERMS OF THE FEES- AND LOOKING

01:49:49.683 --> 01:49:51.818
AT. THIS THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:54.254
REASONS ABOARD ASSET- A SUB

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:56.523
COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:58.191
ISSUE- THE BOARD DID VIEW. THE

01:49:58.258 --> 01:49:59.926
CURRENT APPLICATION AND RENEWAL

HEALTH CARE. BOARDS AND

01:50:03.630 --> 01:50:05.398
CERTAINLY THIS BOARD IS CHARGING

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:08.001
LOWER FEES. LOWER THAN MOST-

01:50:08.068 --> 01:50:09.769
ALSO EVEN IN TERMS OF-

01:50:09.836 --> 01:50:11.504
ASSOCIATION MEMBERSHIPS THAT THE

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:13.707
BOARD'S LICENSING RENEWAL FEE

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:15.709
AND APPLICATION FEES. ARE YOU

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:18.278
KNOW ARE ALSO. LESS THE BOARD

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:21.047
DOES RECOGNIZE THE BURDEN TO THE

01:50:21.114 --> 01:50:22.716
LICENSEES WHEN THERE IS ANY

01:50:22.782 --> 01:50:24.250
PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS WHEN

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:25.785
THERE ARE INCREASES IN THOSE

01:50:25.852 --> 01:50:27.854
FEES. WHICH IS WHY THE BOARD IS

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.123
ALSO LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:31.558
FEES- THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE

01:50:31.624 --> 01:50:32.492
ADDRESSED FOR EXAMPLE

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:34.761
INCREASING- AN APPLICATION FEE

01:50:34.828 --> 01:50:36.863
FROM FIFTY DOLLARS. TO SEVENTY

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.565
FIVE DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE- THAT

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:40.834
MODEST INCREASE THOUGH. TO THE

01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:43.336
APPLICANTS WOULD HAVE A BEARING

01:50:43.403 --> 01:50:46.773
ON ALTERNATELY THE FEE NECESSARY

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.875
TO BE INCREASED FOR THE RENEWAL

01:50:48.942 --> 01:50:51.244
FEE AN OPTION TO RENEW V. AS THE

01:50:51.311 --> 01:50:52.178
PRIMARY- REVENUE SOURCE. THE

01:50:52.245 --> 01:50:57.951
BOARD. DOES FEEL THAT WE'VE DONE

01:50:58.018 --> 01:50:59.886
A GOOD JOB. MANAGING BUDGETS

01:50:59.953 --> 01:51:00.954
JUST- UNPLANNED- INCREASES AND

01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:02.389
IN THE BOARD EVERY WE DID

01:51:02.455 --> 01:51:04.424
PROVIDE. A TEN YEAR HISTORICAL

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:05.592

CONTINUED HER VERSION OF FUNDS

01:51:08.194 --> 01:51:10.030
SO I THINK THAT IT'S NOT SO

01:51:10.096 --> 01:51:13.099
MUCH- MAYBE A MANAGEMENT WE

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:14.267
OBSCENE CLOSELY MANAGE AND

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:16.069
MONITOR THE BOARD'S BUDGET. BUT

01:51:16.136 --> 01:51:19.172
IT SIMPLY HISTORICALLY- UNDER

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:21.474
EARNING THE REVENUE NECESSARY TO

SUPPORT THOSE EXPENDITURES I

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:26.746
HOPE THAT'S BEEN RESPONSIVE TO

INSOLVENCY RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS

FROM NOW- AND SO THAT THAT

02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:44.196
STATUTORY CAP IS IMPORTANT TO US

02:01:44.263 --> 02:01:48.167

02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:50.236
FAR OFF AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:52.772

02:01:52.838 --> 02:01:54.040
ARE REALLY JUST AN OPENING TO

02:01:54.106 --> 02:01:56.342
LET YOU YOU KNOW DISCUSS IT IF

YOU LIKE BUT- I KNOW THAT YOU

02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.245
HAVE A LIMITATION ON. HOW OFTEN

02:01:59.311 --> 02:02:00.846
A PATIENT CAN SEE THE PHYSICAL

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.815
THERAPIST BEFORE POSITION NEEDS

02:02:02.882 --> 02:02:03.849
TO PHYSICALLY EXAMINE THE

02:02:03.916 --> 02:02:05.885
PATIENT. AND SIGN OFF ON

02:02:05.951 --> 02:02:07.019
CONTINUE TREATMENT I KNOW THAT

02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:08.721
THIS WAS WAVE DURING THE

02:02:08.788 --> 02:02:10.189
PANDEMIC- AND THAT THERE IS A

02:02:10.256 --> 02:02:12.058
DESIRE TO SEE THAT MADE

02:02:12.124 --> 02:02:13.859
PERMANENT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK

02:02:13.926 --> 02:02:17.196
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ISSUE.

02:02:17.263 --> 02:02:21.267
YES SO- THAT WAIVER ALLOWED FOR

02:02:21.333 --> 02:02:22.301
A TELEHEALTH VISIT WOULD

02:02:22.368 --> 02:02:24.003
POSITION. AND THE PATIENCE OF A

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:26.272
FACE TO FACE VISIT AND WE DO

02:02:26.338 --> 02:02:28.240
FEEL LIKE THAT SHOULD CONTINUE

02:02:28.307 --> 02:02:30.342
INDEFINITELY SO OVER THE

02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:31.644
PANDEMIC THE MODEL WORKS VERY

02:02:31.711 --> 02:02:33.145
WELL WITH PHYSICAL THERAPIST

02:02:33.212 --> 02:02:34.647
STILL REFERRING PATIENTS BACK TO

02:02:34.714 --> 02:02:36.348
THEIR DOCTORS THE STUFF FACE TO

02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:38.084
FACE VISITS. WHEN THAT WAS

02:02:38.150 --> 02:02:40.052
NECESSARY WITH THE PRACTITIONER

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:41.821
FELT LIKE THE PATIENT DID NEED

02:02:41.887 --> 02:02:44.223
TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR BUT IN ORDER

02:02:44.290 --> 02:02:45.891
JUST TO CONTINUE THE SERVICES

02:02:45.958 --> 02:02:48.027
AND YOU A DELAY IN SERVICES I

02:02:48.094 --> 02:02:49.929
THINK THAT I'M CONTINUING THIS

02:02:49.995 --> 02:02:54.500
TELEHEALTH IS IT COULD BE VERY.

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:55.234
BENEFICIAL TO PATIENT CARE. YOU

02:02:55.301 --> 02:02:57.837
CAN ADD. YOU KNOW THE ONLY THING

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:59.805
I WOULD ASK THAT IF SOMEONE OR

02:02:59.872 --> 02:03:01.407
JUST A MODERNIZATION APPROACH

02:03:01.474 --> 02:03:02.608
RIGHT SO WHEN THOSE STATUTES

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:04.910
WRITTEN- TELEMEDICINE WAS IN ITS

02:03:04.977 --> 02:03:07.179
INFANCY AND NOW I THINK WITH OUR

02:03:07.246 --> 02:03:08.447
EXPERIENCES STRUGGLE

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.416
ACADEMICALLY REALIZED THEY CAN

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:12.785
WORK VERY WELL- AND WE WOULD

02:03:12.852 --> 02:03:14.620
STILL BE RELYING ON SPECIAL BOTH

02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:16.655
PRACTITIONERS IN THE MATTER AND

02:03:16.722 --> 02:03:18.824
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATE

02:03:18.891 --> 02:03:20.226
BUT I THINK JUST REMOVING THE

02:03:20.292 --> 02:03:21.560
WORDS IN PERSON FROM THAT

02:03:21.627 --> 02:03:25.664
