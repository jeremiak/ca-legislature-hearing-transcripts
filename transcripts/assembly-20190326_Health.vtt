A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.861

ABOUT BEFORE -- SO AB SIXTY TWO

00:41:20.644 --> 00:41:21.946

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:25.749
APPLY FOR FEDERAL FUNDS FOR

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.218
ESTABLISHING A REAL TIME WEB

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:30.988
BASED BAD REGISTRY -- AS WE DEAL

00:41:31.055 --> 00:41:33.123
WITH OUR PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS THAT

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.193
IS EVERYWHERE -- THE THE CONCEPT

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.828
THAT WE NEED MORE BEDS AND MORE

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:40.364
RESOURCES IS WITHOUT QUESTION

00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:41.632
BUT WHAT WE ALSO NEED SOMETIMES

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.968
IS A MORE DIRECT WAY TO BE ABLE

00:41:44.034 --> 00:41:45.202
TO ASSESS WHAT BETTER OUT THERE

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:46.837
WHEN SOMEONE COMES IN CRISIS SO

00:41:46.904 --> 00:41:50.541
WE CAN MORE QUICKLY.

00:41:50.608 --> 00:41:52.142
I GET PEOPLE INTO TREATMENT.

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:53.277
SO A REGISTRY AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:54.612
ASKING PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR THE

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.046
FUNDS TO CREATE ONE WOULD HAVE

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.548
EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE ALL

00:41:57.615 --> 00:41:59.350
STAKEHOLDERS THAT MAY COME UP.

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:00.384
TO OBJECT TO THIS WOULD BE

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.953
INVITED IN TO SAY HOW DO WE BEST

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.955
MAKE THIS WORK -- AND REGISTRY

00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:06.824
WOULD GIVE A BOOK SO NOBODY

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:08.559
COMES INTO -- TO MERGES YOU ROOM

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:09.660
THERE IN PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:10.895
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND A BED FOR

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.363
THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE IF THEY ARE

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:13.664
DEEMED. TO THE THEY NEED

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:14.765
INPATIENT TREATMENT.

00:42:14.832 --> 00:42:16.233
OFTENTIMES AS ON THE PHONE THAT

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.268
IS CALLING AT THE SAME TIME

00:42:17.334 --> 00:42:18.936
SOMEBODY IS IN THE EMERGENCY

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:21.038
ROOM IN CRISIS TAKING A BED

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:22.539
SPACE FOR SOMEBODY ELSE WHEN A

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:27.678
MORE SUITABLE -- LEVEL OF CARE

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.280
WOULD BE INDICATED FOR THEM.

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.047
THE SOONER WE GET SOMEBODY AND

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:30.848
IN PATIENT CARE THE SOONER THEY

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.316
GET STABILIZED AND THEN WE ALSO

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:33.951
CLEAR OUT SPACE IN THE EMERGENCY

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:35.219
ROOM FOR ACTUAL.

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:37.388
CASES THAT NEED MORE MEDICAL

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:39.657
EMERGENCY TREATMENT OUT ANY TIME.

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.025
SO AN ONLINE BED REGISTRY WOULD

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:43.093
BE UPDATED IN REAL TIME AS WAYS

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.895
TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE BUT IF YOU

00:42:44.962 --> 00:42:46.130
NEED SOMETHING MORE SUB SUB USED

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:47.531
TO BE A LOCKED FACILITY AT

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:48.799
CHILDREN'S BAD UP FEMALE ONLY

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.234
ALL OF THESE THINGS COULD BE

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.969
UPDATED IN A REAL TIME ONLINE

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:54.672
DATA SYSTEM -- AGAIN THIS IS NOT

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:56.607
THE END ALL BE ALL BUT THIS IS A

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:57.374
BETTER WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.076
PATIENTS TO THE APPROPRIATE

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:01.712
LEVEL OF CARE -- WITH AS LITTLE

00:43:01.779 --> 00:43:03.847
TIME WASTED AS POSSIBLE -- WITH

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:05.282
ME HERE IS I HAVE MISSED RENTAL

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:06.717
HAGAR WHO YOU MAY HAVE HEARD

00:43:06.784 --> 00:43:08.018
FROM BEFORE ON BEHALF THE

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:09.853
CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.222
PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION.

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.591
HI I AM RENTAL HAGER FROM THE

00:43:14.658 --> 00:43:15.459
CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC SITUATION

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.294
THIS IS ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT --

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:20.731
THIS IS SO THIS CONCEPT HERE IS --

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:21.198
I THINK.

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:23.367
IT IN IT IS A SIMPLE ONE AND IT

00:43:23.434 --> 00:43:25.803
REALLY IS CAN CONNECTING A

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.871
CONSUMERS TO THE SERVICES THAT

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.340
THEY NEED WHEN THEY'RE AT THAT

00:43:29.406 --> 00:43:30.975
LEVEL OF CARE WHERE THEY NEED AN

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:31.942
INPATIENT BAD.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.277
OR MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE A

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:34.812
RESIDENTIAL BAD OR SOMETHING

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:42.853
LIKE THAT -- AND THE THE

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.687
INVESTIGATION THAT I'VE DONE TO

00:43:43.754 --> 00:43:45.022
TELLS ME THAT THIS IS SIMPLE

00:43:45.089 --> 00:43:46.423
TECHNOLOGY TO SET UP -- IF YOU

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:47.458
CAN SOME SOME IN AND UBER OR

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:48.993
LIFT CAR BY A COUPLE TOUCHES ON

00:43:49.059 --> 00:43:53.063
YOUR IPHONE -- AND OR IF THE

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.766
HOSPITAL -- CAN UPLOAD DATA

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.201
ABOUT AN OPENING IN THEIR BED BY

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:58.936
COUPLE TOUCHES ON SIMILAR KINDS

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.671
OF TECHNOLOGY WHY CAN'T WE DO

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:01.839
THIS.

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:03.574
FOR THIS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.909
NEED WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE --

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.511
TOO FEW -- PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:10.114
BEDS -- SO IT'S CRITICAL NOT TO

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:12.383
GET ENGAGE AND EXERCISES WHERE

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.951
YOU GO THROUGH PAPERLESS OR

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:14.752
MAYBE.

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:16.587
A LIST OF OF THAT MIGHT BE

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.689
ONLINE BUT IT'S KIND OF A COLD

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.824
CALLING KIND OF PROCESS -- AND

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.793
AND HOPE THAT YOU CAN FIND A BED

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.261
QUICKLY BECAUSE OFTEN PEOPLE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:25.596

HAS TO COME ALONG WITH THAT.

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.815
AND THAT REQUIRES A CONVERSATION

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:27.117
BETWEEN CLINICIANS -- SO JUST

00:46:27.184 --> 00:46:28.619

CLINICIAN TO CLINICIAN TALK

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:35.699
WOULD STILL OCCUR NO MATTER WHAT.

00:50:35.766 --> 00:50:36.900
THIS HOPEFULLY JUST REDUCE THE

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:39.770
AMOUNT OF TIME -- AND EFFICIENCY

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:41.004
WITH WHICH YOU CAN GET SOMEBODY

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.606
PLACED.

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:44.040
RIGHT AND AND FOR FOR THE

00:50:44.107 --> 00:50:45.542
OPPOSITION HOW DO YOU SEE THAT

00:50:45.609 --> 00:50:46.777
WITH RESPECT.

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:47.778
THAT EXPLANATION.

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.146
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THIS

00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:50.180
WE'VE LOOKED TO WHAT HAPPENED IN

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.182
VIRGINIA VIRGINIA DID A VERY

00:50:52.249 --> 00:50:53.717
SIMILAR MODEL THEY HAD A

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.752
MANDATED REAL TIME THAT REGISTRY

00:50:55.819 --> 00:50:57.254
FOR PSYCHIATRIC BATS.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.688
AND BECAUSE KEEPING THAT

00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:00.157
INFORMATION UP IN REAL TIME IS

00:51:00.223 --> 00:51:02.659
SO DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:03.894
IT WAS ACTUALLY TAKING LONGER TO

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.929
FIND A BET BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE

00:51:05.996 --> 00:51:07.197
LOOKING AT A REGISTRY THAT

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:09.833
WASN'T ACCURATE BECAUSE IT IS SO

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.735
DIFFICULT TO KEEP IT ACCURATE --

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:12.569
SO WHEN WE AGAIN WE LOOK AT THIS

00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.471
IT'S REALLY THE REAL TIME NATURE

00:51:14.538 --> 00:51:16.373
OF THIS -- THAT WE THINK IS

00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:18.208
GOING TO BE IN FEASIBLE FOR OUR

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.110
MEMBERS TO COMPLY WITH SO LET ME

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.545
ASK A DIRECT QUESTION IS THERE A

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:22.412
MECHANISM BY.

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:24.114
WHICH YOU CAN WORK WITH THE

00:51:24.181 --> 00:51:26.216
AUTHOR AND THIS BILL. TO RESOLVE

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.585
IT YOU HAVE SEATED HERE BEFORE

00:51:28.652 --> 00:51:30.287
YOU THREE OUT OF THREE OF THE

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.155
EMTS WHO ACTUALLY ARE ON THE

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:32.789
GROUND.

00:51:32.856 --> 00:51:35.792
WORKING IN THIS SCENARIO QUIRK

00:51:35.859 --> 00:51:40.997
BRINGING FORTH OF PATIENTS TO

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:44.000
THE HOSPITAL'S -- MR FLORA

00:51:44.067 --> 00:51:47.537
MYSELF AND MR INCREASE HERE --

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:49.439
RECOGNIZE THAT WERE FILLING BEDS

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:50.040
IN THE E. OURS THAT DON'T NEED

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.908
TO BE FILLED WITH PATIENTS THAT

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:53.143
DON'T REALLY QUALIFY FOR MERCY

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:54.044
MEDICAL.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.779
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS WHO

00:51:55.846 --> 00:51:57.314
HAVE SERIOUS SERIOUS.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:51:59.015
INJURIES OR OTHER ISSUES THAT

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.116
THEY'RE FACING.

00:52:00.183 --> 00:52:01.985
WHERE WE CAN HANDLE THE TYPE OF

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:02.919
PATIENTS THAT WERE REFLECTING

00:52:02.986 --> 00:52:05.055
HERE TODAY IN A IN A MUCH BETTER

00:52:05.121 --> 00:52:06.623
WAY IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY?

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:09.092
CAN YOU WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON

00:52:09.159 --> 00:52:10.560
FINDING A RESOLUTION FOR THIS.

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:12.729
ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO THAT --

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:13.864
ONE THING I WOULD KNOW AND I

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.332
APPRECIATE YOU YOU RAISING THAT

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:18.201
WE DID A STUDY IN ABOUT 70%.

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.669
OF THOSE IN EMERGENCY ROOMS WITH

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.171
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:22.472
DON'T NEED TO BE THERE THEY

00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:24.040
DON'T HAVE AN EMERGENT CONDITION.

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.208
SO SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:52:25.275 --> 00:52:26.376
THIS YEAR IS SPONSORING

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:27.811

INDIVIDUALS TO THE APPROPRIATE

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:31.882
PLACE BEFORE THEY COME TO THE

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:33.717
EMERGENCY ROOM -- THAT'S ONE

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:34.718
APPROACH WORKING ON THIS YEAR

00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:36.319
BUT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE THE

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:38.588
COMMITMENT OF OUR ASSOCIATION TO

TO THE AUTHOR MAYBE.

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:42.459
WHAT IT WILL TAKE A LOOK FOR

00:52:42.526 --> 00:52:46.062
YOUR BILL TO CONTINUE MOVING

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.330
FORWARD WHICH I SUPPORT?

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.698
MAYBE THEY'LL TAKE A LITTLE TIME

00:52:48.765 --> 00:52:49.566
FOR THEM TO PERFECT OR MAYBE

00:52:49.633 --> 00:52:50.967
WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE TO HELP

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:53.003
PERFECT.

00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:54.671
HOW WE CAN DIRECT THIS IN A MORE

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:55.872
EFFICIENT WAY?

00:52:55.939 --> 00:52:56.873
IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THIS

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.441
CONVERSATION JUST A LITTLE BIT

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.543
WE ALREADY HAVE A WORKING MODEL

00:52:59.609 --> 00:53:01.211
IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ACTUALLY THE

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:03.046
LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT.

00:53:03.113 --> 00:53:04.748

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:07.651
INVENTORY AND IT IS AMAZING --

THAT IS A WILL NOT MY WORD BUT

00:53:09.185 --> 00:53:10.620
IS THE WORD OF PSYCHIATRISTS WHO

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:12.656
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND

00:53:12.722 --> 00:53:13.857
I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT HOW

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:16.326
THEY ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.928
AND AND HAVE DEVELOPED IT.

00:53:17.994 --> 00:53:20.330
AND THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE

00:53:20.397 --> 00:53:21.598
FOR DISCUSSION.

00:53:21.665 --> 00:53:23.633
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

DO YOU KIND OF RESERVE THAT BAD

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.524
IN ADVANCE FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:48.625

DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE ANSWER TO

00:54:02.272 --> 00:54:03.139
THAT.

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:05.141
YEAH I THINK IT DIFFERS -- FROM

00:54:05.208 --> 00:54:06.610
THE PROCESS OF RESERVING A ROOM

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:08.478
AT A HOTEL IN THAT THE MOMENT

00:54:08.545 --> 00:54:09.579
YOU PUSH THE BUTTON THAN THAT

00:54:09.646 --> 00:54:11.381
BUT THAT BAD SPACES SOLD

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.550
ESSENTIALLY -- AGAIN I THINK

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:16.353
IT'S A THERE IS A A DOCTOR IF

00:54:16.419 --> 00:54:17.654

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:20.290
CONNECTION THAT THAT REALLY SAYS

00:54:20.357 --> 00:54:21.625
TO BOTH PARTIES THIS IS

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:23.259
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS PATIENT YES

00:54:23.326 --> 00:54:25.829
WE WILL TAKE THIS PATIENT YOU'VE

00:54:25.895 --> 00:54:26.496
MADE THAT COMMITMENT.

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:27.764
SO I BELIEVE WHETHER OR NOT

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.299
YOU'RE COMING FROM YOUR RICA OR

00:54:29.366 --> 00:54:31.267
JUST FROM YOLO COUNTY TO

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:31.835
SACRAMENTO THAT WOULD BE THE

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:33.737
ARRANGEMENT.

00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.438
THAT IS THAT HAVE TO HELP PLACE

00:54:35.505 --> 00:54:37.040
OUT.

00:54:37.107 --> 00:54:37.807
YEAH IN IN THAT'S CORRECT IN

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:39.009
THAT THERE WOULD NEED TO BE A

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.744
DISCUSSION BETWEEN DOCTORS ABOUT

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:41.811
WHETHER OR NOT THAT THAT IS

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:43.313
APPROPRIATE AND GENERALLY

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.981
EMERGENCY ROOMS WILL HAVE.

00:54:45.048 --> 00:54:47.350
A LIST THAT THEY OF OF

00:54:47.417 --> 00:54:48.885
FACILITIES THAT THEY WOULD CALL

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:50.086
TO SEE IF THERE COULD BE AN

00:54:50.153 --> 00:54:51.855
APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT -- THIS

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:52.656
THE HOSPITAL THEY'RE BEING

00:54:52.722 --> 00:54:54.157
TRANSFERRED TO HAS TO HAVE THE

00:54:54.224 --> 00:54:56.626
CAPACITY -- AND CAPABILITY TO

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:58.161
TREAT THE PATIENT -- AND THAT'S

00:54:58.228 --> 00:54:59.095
PART OF THE DISCUSSION WOULD

00:54:59.162 --> 00:55:00.163
HAPPEN WITH THE EMERGENCE FROM

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:01.464
CAN WE TAKE THE PATIENT DO WE

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.499
HAVE THE RIGHT.

00:55:02.565 --> 00:55:03.333
PROVIDERS WE HAVE THE RIGHT

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.868
DOCTORS TO ACTUALLY TAKE THE

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.936
PATIENT WHAT'S THEIR NEED -- IT

00:55:07.003 --> 00:55:09.839
DEPENDS ALSO ON HOW SICK THE

00:55:09.906 --> 00:55:10.340
PERSON AS THEY WOULD GET

00:55:10.407 --> 00:55:12.075
PRIORITY.

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:14.144
SO RECOGNIZING THAT -- THAT THE

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.578
IT DIDN'T THE ACUITY OF THE CASE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:17.947
IS IS IMPORTANT AND HOW HOW

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.516
EVERYTHING GETS PUT PORK.

00:55:19.582 --> 00:55:21.518
WOULD IT NOT BE A GOOD IDEA TO

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.920
HAVE SORT OF AN UPDATED REGISTRY

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:25.555
BECAUSE OTHERWISE.

00:55:25.622 --> 00:55:26.523
DID YOU HAVE DOCTORS GOING

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.824
THROUGH THE TOP OF THE LIST

00:55:27.891 --> 00:55:29.259
GOING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM LIST

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:30.860
EVERY SINGLE TIME THEY TRY TO

00:55:30.927 --> 00:55:32.228
PLACE A PATIENT.

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.030
SO WOULDN'T IT BE NICE TO KNOW

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.065
I'M JUST I'M.

00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:38.101

AVAILABLE THERE POTENTIALLY

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:20.677
AVAILABLE SO THAT YOU HAVE A

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:21.911
WEIGHT PLACE TO START RATHER

00:56:21.978 --> 00:56:24.114
THAN STARTING TO TOPPLE LISTING

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:32.055
WITH THAT IT IS THERE ANY OTHER

00:56:32.122 --> 00:56:34.157
QUESTIONS OR COME MISTER BIG

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:35.558
MISTER BIGELOW.

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:36.159
I WAS JUST GONNA WIN ON YOUR

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:37.660
COMPONENT IT IT DOES GET A

00:56:37.727 --> 00:56:38.695
LITTLE MORE A LITTLE MORE

00:56:38.762 --> 00:56:41.498
COMPLICATED. FOR THE THREE OF US

00:56:41.564 --> 00:56:43.032
WERE FOUND BY SCOPES AND

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:45.101
PRACTICES SURE -- AND LIKE YOU

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:46.803
ARE AS A DOCTOR WHAT WE CAN OF

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.872
WHAT ONE CAN DO AND IN OUR CASE

00:56:48.938 --> 00:56:49.873
WE GET A A PERSON WITH MENTAL

00:56:49.939 --> 00:56:50.573
HEALTH.

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.208
AND THAT PERSON TO PATIENT AND

00:56:52.275 --> 00:56:53.743
WE'RE TRANSPORTED WE'RE GOING TO

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:55.945
WORK OUR INITIAL BASE HOSPITAL.

00:56:56.012 --> 00:56:57.380
THE NEXT IF THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:58.381
THEN IT GOES TO THE NEXT

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.382
AVAILABLE HOSPITAL.

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.750
AND SO IT BECOMES VERY

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:02.819
COMPLICATED FOR US BECAUSE THAT

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:03.353

00:57:05.889 --> 00:57:07.657

00:57:07.724 --> 00:57:08.491
SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE TO GO

00:57:08.558 --> 00:57:11.628
BECAUSE EACH STEP GETS FARTHER

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:12.162
AWAY FROM THE PATIENT AND

00:57:12.228 --> 00:57:12.762
TREATMENT.

00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:14.430

SEVEN THIRTY ONE THIS BILL IS

01:07:16.399 --> 01:07:18.367
HOW WE START TO HOLD HEALTH

01:07:18.434 --> 01:07:20.636

OUR MEMBERS POCKETS IN THE FORM

01:07:36.118 --> 01:07:37.420

01:08:02.978 --> 01:08:05.314
BECAUSE PREMIUMS INCREASE

01:08:05.381 --> 01:08:07.183
BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING PRICES

01:08:07.249 --> 01:08:09.819

HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO OTHER

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:36.979
AREAS OF OUR STATE IS

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.482

BE IMPLEMENTED IN THOSE MARKETS

01:12:24.339 --> 01:12:25.774

HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO THE

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:53.755
BILL.

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:54.656
I THINK THE UNFORTUNATE NATURE

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.191
OF THIS IS WE DO SEE OURSELVES

01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.326
AS INSURERS AS PARTNERS WITH A

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:59.194
LARGE GROUP COMMUNITY TO COME UP

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.199
THAT MEET THEIR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:06.969

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.203
FIVE FORTY SIX EDA ALSO HELD A

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:09.404

AND LOOKED AT THE AGGREGATE OF

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:13.008
LARGE GROUP RATE FILINGS I THINK

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.111
THEY ESTIMATED THIRTY TWO

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.746
HUNDRED INDIVIDUAL RATE FILINGS

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.081
THAT THEY RECEIVED AND LOOKED

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.883

LEAST WERE EXPERIENCE RATED.

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:23.285
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:25.587
NEED TO LOOK AT AS THE VOLUME IN

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.522
TOTALITY OF THESE UNIQUE --

01:15:27.589 --> 01:15:29.524
INDIVIDUAL FILINGS WE ALSO SEE

01:15:29.591 --> 01:15:31.960
OURSELVES AS A COLLABORATIVE

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.896
EFFORT WITH OUR LARGE EMPLOYERS

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:35.497
AND SPECIFICALLY SEVERAL YEARS

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:39.268
AGO WE REMOVED OPPOSITION TO SB

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.435
ELEVEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WE

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:41.470
WORKED REALLY HARD WITH THEM TO

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.171
SEE. TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:44.239
THAT WE THOUGHT WAS REALLY

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:45.407
IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO BETTER

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.809
UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING COST

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.112
AND EXPERIENCE WITHIN THEIR

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:51.413
INSURED WORLD AND SO THAT THEY

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.148
COULD BETTER AND NEGOTIATE THOSE

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.250
RATES AND ALSO COME UP WITH

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:56.151
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.519
DEBT AND DIFFERENT WRITERS ON

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.054
THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES TO HELP

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:00.789
THEM MANAGE THE UNDERLYING

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:03.058
ISSUES AND HEALTH CARE CONCERNS

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:04.826
SO WE WE REALLY DO WANT TO WORK

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:07.029
TOGETHER AS A PARTNER AND AS MY

01:16:07.095 --> 01:16:08.363
COLLEAGUE REFERENCED.

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.798
I THINK UNIVERSALLY MANY OF US

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:11.366
ARE SITTING ON THE REVIEW

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:13.468
COMMITTEE THE EIGHTEEN TEN

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:14.102
ESTABLISHED WITH OUR SPOT TO

01:16:14.169 --> 01:16:15.103
TRYING TO COME UP WITH A

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.072
COLLABORATIVE WAY TO LOOK AT THE

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:18.440
UNDERLYING COST OF HEALTHCARE.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.942
WE THINK THAT THAT CERTAINLY IS

01:16:20.008 --> 01:16:21.910
A VERY VERY USEFUL WAY OF ALL OF

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.578
US TO COME TOGETHER IN A

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.480
COLLECTIVE WAY TO ANSWER THOSE

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:26.848
NAGGING QUESTIONS THAT EVERYONE

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.250
HAS IS WHAT ARE THE COST DRIVERS

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:29.685
IN THE SYSTEM.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.420
AND I THINK OUR LAST CONCERN AND

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:33.322
AND JUST POINTED OUT I'M IN A

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:33.956
SEVERAL THE SECTIONS THEY DO

01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.057
REMOVE SOME OF THE

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.726
CONFIDENTIALITY -- THAT EXISTED

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:38.660
IN STATUTES SINCE THE

01:16:38.727 --> 01:16:41.063
ORIGINATION OF ELEVEN SIXTY

01:16:41.129 --> 01:16:41.830
THREE THINK WE ARE CONCERNED

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:47.269
ABOUT WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN AND

01:16:47.336 --> 01:16:47.903
ALSO THE CONFUSION FOR WHICH IF

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:50.339
YOU PUT OUT DIFFERENT RATES AND

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:51.506
CONTRACTED RATES -- THAT OTHER

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:52.674
INDIVIDUALS WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:53.308
THE EXPERIENCE RATING NOR WHAT

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.443
WAS THE DRIVER OF THOSE

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:56.778
INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED RATE SO

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:57.846
FOR THOSE REASONS WE RAIN OPPOSE

01:16:57.913 --> 01:16:59.614
BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:00.615
THE COMMITTEE.

01:17:00.682 --> 01:17:02.651
AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AT THIS

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:05.387
BILL MOVES FOR TODAY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.723

INSURANCE PLANS ALSO IN

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.996
OPPOSITION.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:14.963
KAREN SARKISIAN WITH THE

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:17.165
CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:19.401
IN OPPOSITION.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:21.370
MUCH ANYONE ELSE. TO NUMBER

01:17:21.436 --> 01:17:23.238
BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:24.606
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:25.741
QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE

01:17:25.807 --> 01:17:26.041
[inaudible]

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:29.478
MISS WALDRON.

01:17:29.544 --> 01:17:33.415
I GUESS I'LL NEED OFF -- OKAY SO.

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:34.149
I WAS LOOKING BACK ON THE

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:36.184
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:40.789
ACA -- THEY REQUIRED OF THAT A

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:42.090
WAIT REVIEW BASICALLY WOULD BE

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:42.891
DONE.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:46.328
ON THE SMALLER INDIVIDUAL

01:17:46.395 --> 01:17:47.629
CONTRACTS BUT NOT.

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.998
ON THE LARGER AND THAT WAS BASED

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:52.901
ON THAT EMPLOYERS GENERALLY HAVE

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.903
A GREATER NEGOTIATING.

01:17:54.970 --> 01:17:57.239
ABILITY -- AND CHOICE IN THE

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.374
MARKETPLACE.

01:17:59.441 --> 01:18:00.475
IN A AND I REMEMBER NEGOTIATING

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:02.010
A LOT OF THINGS WHEN I WAS ON

01:18:02.077 --> 01:18:03.478
THE CITY COUNCIL YOU KNOW FOR

01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:05.580
THE CITY OF MULTIPLE THOUSANDS

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:08.250
OF EMPLOYEES -- EVEN BACK THEN

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.217
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND

01:18:09.284 --> 01:18:13.155
HUMAN SERVICES INDICATED THAT --

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:15.557
THOSE PURCHASERS OF LARGE GROUP --

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.592
MARKETS HAVE GREATER LEVERAGE TO

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:20.095
AVOID ON RATE INCREASES.

01:18:20.162 --> 01:18:23.365
SO MY QUESTION AND MAYBE I DON'T

01:18:23.432 --> 01:18:24.900
KNOW START WITH THE OPPOSITION

01:18:24.966 --> 01:18:26.168
IS.

01:18:26.234 --> 01:18:27.402
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WOULD IT

01:18:27.469 --> 01:18:28.970
HEARINGS OF THIS COST BECAUSE

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.772
DEFINITELY THERE'S A COST IN

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:33.642
THAT WOULD SOMEHOW END UP IN A

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:37.479
RATES TO I WANT TO SAY.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.380
OR DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.481
HOW DOES THIS?

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.116
HOW MUCH IMPACT [inaudible]

01:18:41.183 --> 01:18:43.885
IS IT.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.287
WELL THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:45.887
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARE YOU KNOW

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:46.888
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVEN'T IN A

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.323
SPECIFIC FISCAL ON THIS

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.158
PARTICULAR BILL.

01:18:50.225 --> 01:18:52.127
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE BILL

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:55.063
WOULD REQUIRE -- YOU KNOW ARE

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:56.331
ALL LARGE GROUP RATE FILINGS TO

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:59.034
BE SUBMITTED -- TO THE STATE --

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:00.902
IT WOULD REQUIRE THE HIRING OF

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:02.904
NEW STAFF AT THE AT THE HEALTH

01:19:02.971 --> 01:19:04.673
PLAN LEVEL IN OF COURSE.

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:06.475
WE KNOW THE POLICY MAKERS ARE --

01:19:06.541 --> 01:19:07.609
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE LEVEL

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:09.578
OF ADMINISTRATION THAT CURRENTLY

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:13.849
EXISTS IN HEALTH CARE -- WE

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.317
WOULD SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW THE

01:19:15.383 --> 01:19:16.918
STATE HAS ANALYZED -- YOU KNOW

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:18.186
SIMILAR BILLS IN THE PAST AND WE

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:19.221
CAN GO BACK AND CHECK THOSE

01:19:19.287 --> 01:19:21.223
ANALYSES OUT -- BUT I THINK YOU

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.058
YOU YOU RAISE A REALLY GOOD

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.260
POINT THOUGH IN THAT -- IT ONE

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:27.062
OF THE REASONS THE ACA DIDN'T GO

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:29.531
IN THIS DIRECTION IS THAT -- YOU

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:30.232
KNOW THESE ARE LARGE

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:33.602
SOPHISTICATED ACTORS AND THEY

01:19:33.668 --> 01:19:35.570
ARE PLANS COMPETE FOR THIS

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.672
BUSINESS AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:19:37.739 --> 01:19:38.907
WE CAN'T GET INTO SPECIFICS YOU

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:39.741
KNOW BE IN BEING AT THE

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.209
ASSOCIATION LEVEL BUT WE HAVE

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.411
HEARD STORIES OF THEM TRYING TO

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:44.012
BEAT EACH OTHER OUT FOR THESE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:44.579
CONTRACTS.

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:47.048
WITH THE EMPLOYERS HAVE A LOT OF

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:48.183
YOU KNOW THE LARGE EMPLOYERS DO

01:19:48.250 --> 01:19:49.117
YOU HAVE A LOT OF LEVERAGE IN

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:50.652
THIS AREA WHICH IS WHY IT'S IT

01:19:50.719 --> 01:19:54.222
HAS BEEN CONTEMPLATED A VERY

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:55.524
EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE.

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:57.659
PARTICULARLY IF IF -- THE STATE

01:19:57.726 --> 01:19:59.161
HAD THIRTEEN THOUSAND RENEWALS

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:01.696
LAST YEAR SO THAT'S THAT'S A LOT.

01:20:01.763 --> 01:20:03.832
OF RENEWALS -- SO THAT WOULD BE

01:20:03.899 --> 01:20:04.966
A LOT OF WORK FOR OUR PLANS AND

01:20:05.033 --> 01:20:06.067
FOR THE STATE'S REVIEW WE'RE NOT

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.135
SURE HOW THEY WOULD DO IT.

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:09.037
WHAT ONE OF THE ONLY THE OTHER

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:10.705
THING I WOULD POINT OUT -- TO

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:11.907
THE EXTENT THAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:13.875
HAVE TO HIRE NEW STAFF THAT'S AN

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:14.976
INCREASE TO THE COST OF THE

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.411
PLANS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:17.712
MANAGED HEALTHCARE IS ENTIRELY

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:18.914
FUNDED THROUGH LICENSING FEES ON

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.415
HEALTH PLANS SO IT'S A DOUBLE

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.349
HIT.

01:20:21.416 --> 01:20:22.751
WE WOULD HAVE TO HIRE INTERNALLY

01:20:22.817 --> 01:20:25.820
OUR LICENSING FEES WOULD GO UP

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:26.421
FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO HIRE NEW

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:26.821
STAFF.

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:27.822
OKAY.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.291
IT'S THE SAME FOR CDI THEY WOULD

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:30.992
EXPERIENCE THE SAME INFLUX AND

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:32.460
VOLUME THERE MMHM THEIR MARKET

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.062
SHARE IS A LITTLE SMALLER BUT

01:20:34.129 --> 01:20:35.463
WITH THIRTY TWO HUNDRED

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:38.633
PRESUMABLY A LARGE GROUP FILINGS --

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:39.601
THEY WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TO

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.303
HIRE ADDITIONAL STAFF AND THERE

01:20:41.369 --> 01:20:42.604
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL BILLS WHAT IT

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:43.972
TALKED ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.807
STOPPING THE MILLIONS SO IF YOU

01:20:45.874 --> 01:20:47.275
CAN JUST THINK OF THIS SIZE AND

01:20:47.342 --> 01:20:48.543
VOLUME FOR WHICH THAT THEY WOULD

01:20:48.610 --> 01:20:49.744
HAVE TO HIRE AND BRING ON

01:20:49.811 --> 01:20:51.313
EXPERTS IN ACTUARIES.

01:20:51.379 --> 01:20:53.081
THAT'S CERTAINLY A CONCERNED AT

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:53.815
THIS WERE USER FUNDED

01:20:53.882 --> 01:20:54.115
[inaudible]

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:58.553
THANK YOU -- FOR FIRST OF ALL TO

01:20:58.620 --> 01:20:59.688
SUGGEST SOMEHOW THAT THEY DON'T

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:01.223
HAVE  HAND HUNDRED DATA -- WILL

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:03.291
BE IN A SURPRISE TO ME BUT I

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:04.426
WILL JUST SAY THAT.

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:06.261
YOU KNOW THAT'S FIRST KEEP IN

01:21:06.328 --> 01:21:06.828
MIND THAT DEPARTMENT MANAGED

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:07.662
HEALTHCARE.

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:09.164
WHICH I ACTUALLY DID SPEAK

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.732
BEFORE THEM -- JUST A COUPLE

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:12.934
WEEKS AGO AND THIS BILL WAS VERY

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:14.035
MUCH IN AND THIS IS JOSH WAS

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.870
VERY MUCH -- BROUGHT UP THERE

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:18.773
AND THERE WAS NO CONCERN RAISED

01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:20.475
IN TERMS OF COST THEM TIME.

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.010
THEIR BUDGET IS EIGHTY SEVEN

01:21:22.077 --> 01:21:22.711
MILLION DOLLARS OR SO UNDER

01:21:22.777 --> 01:21:24.879
POINT 1% OF A HUNDRED BILLION.

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:26.448
DOLLAR PLUS A COMMERCIAL

01:21:26.514 --> 01:21:27.282
PREMIUMS.

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:29.251
AND LET'S ALSO KEEP IN MIND THE

01:21:29.317 --> 01:21:30.185
DEPARTMENT MANAGED HEALTHCARE

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:31.920
JUST ON THE INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:35.590
pOVER TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:36.558
MILLION DOLLARS.

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.059
THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:38.893
SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:39.494
SO.

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:40.762
THERE'S ABOUT A HALF A BILLION

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:42.364
DOLLARS IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAVED

01:21:42.430 --> 01:21:45.200
BECAUSE OF THIS REVIEW PROCESS.

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:47.402
UP ADDITIONALLY LET'S ALSO KEEP

01:21:47.469 --> 01:21:48.803
IN MIND THAT CURRENTLY THE

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:50.405
REVIEW OF INDIVIDUAL OR SMALL

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:51.740
GROUP PLANS REALLY APPLIES TWO

01:21:51.806 --> 01:21:53.341
HUNDRED OR LESS -- IN TERMS OF

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.076
PLAYERS THAT ARE UNDER A LASSEN

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:56.711
THOSE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:58.213
AB HOWEVER.

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.181
LET'S FOR THE KEEP MY THE NINETY

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:01.683
NINE POINT 8% OF EMPLOYERS IN

01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:03.385
CALIFORNIA HAVE FEWER THAN FIVE

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:04.419
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES.

01:22:04.486 --> 01:22:06.655
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TO WHAT.

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:07.455
THE COMPANIES WHICH ONE

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:09.257
EMPLOYEES HUNDRED FIFTY

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:10.492
EMPLOYEES FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:13.161
NOT NOT EXACTLY THE KIND OF

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:14.829
WALES OF THE SYSTEM TO HAVE THE

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.731
ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THESE

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.733
MASSIVE PLANS -- THE PHARMACY

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:26.374
TORTILLA THEM -- OR REALLY.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.709
THE CHOOSING AMONGST PLANS ARE

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:28.243
OFFERED TO THEM AND NOT.

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:29.177
HAVING THE ABILITY TO TAILOR A

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:29.778
PLAN OF A FOR THEIR OWN NEEDS

01:22:29.844 --> 01:22:31.713
AND THE REALITY IS THIS LOOK

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.013
[inaudible]

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.515
THIS.

01:22:33.581 --> 01:22:35.383
ISN'T A NEW IDEA IS AN IDEA THAT

01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:36.651
WORKS.

01:22:36.718 --> 01:22:38.053
AND AS HAS BEEN WORKING IT'S

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.321
BEEN WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:40.722
BEEN WORKING WITH SMALL PLANS

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.123
THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.958
TO EXPAND IT TO LARGER PLANS.

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:46.861
IF IT'S TRUE.

01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:47.862
THAT THERE THAT THESE.

01:22:47.929 --> 01:22:49.164
EMPLOYERS.

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:51.566
ARE ARE ACTUALLY TRUE PARTNERS.

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:53.001
THIS WILL GIVE THE ABILITY FOR

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:53.535
THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED

01:22:53.601 --> 01:22:54.903
HEALTHCARE TO TO REVIEW THE

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.071
RATES DETERMINED THAT'S TRULY

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.340
THE CASE -- AND IN FACT WHAT WE

01:22:58.406 --> 01:23:00.575
FIND IS THAT WHEN THERE IS RATE

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:01.643
REVIEW IN PLACE OF IT

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.645
INCENTIVIZE BOTH THE INSURERS

01:23:03.712 --> 01:23:05.580
AND EMPLOYERS COME UP WITH PLANS

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:07.215
THAT WORK FOR EVERYONE AND

01:23:07.282 --> 01:23:08.883
THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:10.919
TO IT'S IT'S ONCE A TRANSPARENCY

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:11.553
IS THERE.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:12.954
AND AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:14.622
MANAGED HEALTHCARE THEY THEY

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:15.790
WILL MAKE A STATEMENT AS TO

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.125
WHETHER THEY BELIEVE THE RATE

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.927
INCREASE AS BEING REQUESTED IS

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.761
JUSTIFIED.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.730
AND IT'S JUST THAT ALONE THAT

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:24.632
THAT THAT PUBLIC --

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.801
PRONOUNCEMENT BY ITSELF CAUSES

01:23:26.868 --> 01:23:28.536
ACTION IN THE MARKET AND THAT'S

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:30.572
WAS ALLOWED THEM THEY ARE THEY

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:32.273
OF SMALL INDIVIDUAL PLANS TO

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.275
SAVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:35.944
MILLION DOLLARS IS BECAUSE THE

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.412
SUBSEQUENT ACTION.

01:23:37.479 --> 01:23:39.514
AFTER THAT REPORT OUT IS DONE

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.850
BECAUSE A DOWNWARD TREND IN THE

01:23:41.916 --> 01:23:43.184
INCREASE OF THOSE RATES SO IT'S

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:43.885
SO IT'S REALLY A WINNING

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:45.253
SITUATION NOT TO MENTION

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.354
SOMETHING I KNOW THAT.

01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:47.756
THE CHAIR IS ON A GREAT JOB AND

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:49.157
FOCUSING ON HIS DATA THERE'S

01:23:49.224 --> 01:23:50.658
ALSO A PART OF PROVIDE A LOT

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.761
MORE DATA FOR US AS WE GO

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:55.196
OF DETERMINING

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:55.797
POINTS.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:24:00.135
AND PRICE PRESSURES ARE

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:01.236
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:02.303
THANK YOU I JUST I HAD THAT --

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.172
IF I CAN FIND IT.

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:06.408
JUST GOING BACK FOR TWENTY

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:08.243
SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:10.812
AVERAGE PREMIUM INCREASE -- AN

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:11.980
INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:14.949
MARKETS WAS ABOUT TEN POINT 6%.

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.017
WHERE IS THE AVERAGE PREMIUM

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:17.752
INCREASE FOR THE THE SEVEN

01:24:17.819 --> 01:24:19.187
LARGEST INSURERS IN LARGE GROUP

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:22.424
MARKETS WAS? FOUR POINT 8%.

01:24:22.490 --> 01:24:23.658
SO.

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:25.493
THERE IS A VALUE TO THOSE THE

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.729
NEGOTIATIONS THAT'S GOING ON

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.697
WITH THE LARGER.

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:31.399
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THE FACT THAT

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:33.101
THEY ARE LARGER GIVES THEM A

01:24:33.168 --> 01:24:35.170
BETTER ABILITY ABOUT BUT BECAUSE

01:24:35.236 --> 01:24:36.738
OF THE VOLUME TO HAVE LOWER

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:37.405
RATES.

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.407
WE WOULD PRESUME THAT IT FOR THE

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:40.575
OTHER WAY AROUND.

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.043
THAT WOULD BE REALLY FISHING.

01:24:42.110 --> 01:24:43.244
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT

01:24:43.311 --> 01:24:44.846
PROBABLY THAT IS IN LINE WITH

01:24:44.913 --> 01:24:46.281
HELD.

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.216
IS SUPPOSED TO WORK AND THIS IS

01:24:48.283 --> 01:24:49.918
NOT A GOTCHA YEAH WE'RE NOT OUT

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.453
THROUGH THE THE THIS BILL IS NOT

01:24:51.519 --> 01:24:53.054
OUT BE PUT OUT THERE TO TRY TO

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:54.489
GO AFTER.

01:24:54.556 --> 01:24:55.757
THE INSURERS ARE TRYING AND

01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:57.192
TRYING TO FIND OUT THE YOU KNOW

01:24:57.258 --> 01:25:00.695
THE BAD ACTORS WE HOPE THAT.

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:01.830
THAT YOU KNOW THE RATE REVIEW

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.164
OCCURS AND EVERYTHING IS GREAT.

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:04.966
YOU KNOW BUT THE REALITY IS THAT

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:05.767
REPUBLICAN TO BE IT I'D BE ABLE

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.535
TO IDENTIFY SOME PRESSURE POINT

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:09.304
SOME PRICE POINTS SOME AREAS

01:25:09.370 --> 01:25:10.672
WHERE WE CAN DO BETTER.

01:25:10.738 --> 01:25:11.506
AND SO THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY

01:25:11.573 --> 01:25:12.574
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THIS

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.175
ADDITIONAL ABILITY TO BE ABLE

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.577
REVIEW THE RATES AMONGST A LARGE

01:25:15.643 --> 01:25:17.946
GROUPS WHO COVER FAR MORE PEOPLE

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.848
THAN INDIVIDUAL SMALL GROUP

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.049
PLANS COLLECTIVELY.

01:25:21.115 --> 01:25:23.451
THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible]

01:25:23.518 --> 01:25:26.354
OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:28.857
SO I I DO I DO HAVE ONE AND SO

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:30.158
AND I'LL OPEN THIS TO BOTH SIDES

01:25:30.225 --> 01:25:31.092
SO.

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.794
YOU YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:36.197
COMMENTS -- THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:25:36.264 --> 01:25:38.132
TAKE AN OFF THE SHELF PLAN

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:38.433
[inaudible]

01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.636
SO -- AND THEN WE'VE HEARD THAT

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:43.471
THERE WERE LIKE.

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:44.038
THIRTEEN THOUSAND REVIEWS IT

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:45.640
WOULD HAVE TO HAPPEN.

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.342
DO YOU HAVE A DO WE HAVE AN IDEA

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:48.610
OF WHAT THE HOW MANY BUT THE

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:51.479
PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE THAT TAKE

01:25:51.546 --> 01:25:53.214
THESE OFF THE SHELF PLANS.

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:54.649
A REVIEW IS EVERY YOU MEAN.

01:25:54.716 --> 01:25:57.218
IF IT'S THE SAME PLAN DO WE HAVE

01:25:57.285 --> 01:25:57.485
ANY IDEA.

01:25:57.552 --> 01:25:58.686
WELL THAT WAS THAT.

01:25:58.753 --> 01:26:00.221
IF I CAN DO IS TO FURTHER MY

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:02.690
WITNESS I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE A

01:26:02.757 --> 01:26:03.424
SUGGESTION.

01:26:03.491 --> 01:26:04.959
THINK OF MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS

01:26:05.026 --> 01:26:07.295
BEST FELL FOR HEALTH ACCESS AND

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:08.730
TEAMSTERS UNION RIGHT HERE.

01:26:08.796 --> 01:26:10.465
I WANT TO POINT TO TWO THINGS

01:26:10.532 --> 01:26:12.467
THE EXPERIENCE OF TRUST FUNDS

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:14.802
THAT NEGOTIATE IS THAT THERE

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.037
ISN'T IT IS.

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.472
RATHER LIKE BUYING A NEW CAR

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:18.907
THERE ARE VARIOUS OPTIONS IN

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:21.075
COLORS OFFERED BUT IT'S NOT AN

01:26:21.142 --> 01:26:22.911
ENDLESS SET OF OPTIONS AND

01:26:22.977 --> 01:26:24.479
COLOURS AND COLORS THAT ARE

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:26.114
AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF THE

01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:27.615
PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED.

01:26:27.682 --> 01:26:28.950
I WOULD ALSO POINT TO THE RECENT

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:31.286
REPORT ON THE LARGE GROUP MARKET

01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:33.888
THAT FIND 70% OF THE LARGE GROUP

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:35.590
MARKET JUST COMMUNITY RATED.

01:26:35.657 --> 01:26:37.759
AND ANOTHER 20% IS A BLEND OF

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.494
EXPERIENCE RATED AND COMMUNITY

01:26:39.561 --> 01:26:41.062
RATED.

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:44.299
IF SOMEONE IS ONLY 10% IS PURELY

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:45.667
EXPERIENCE RATED.

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:47.368
SOMEWHAT IN CONTRAST TO WHAT THE

01:26:47.435 --> 01:26:49.637
OTHER SIDE SAID IN TWENTY ELEVEN

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:50.838
WHEN WE BEGAN RATE REVIEW IN

01:26:50.905 --> 01:26:52.273
CALIFORNIA.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.509
THERE WAS NO REQUIREMENT FOR

01:26:54.576 --> 01:26:55.543
COMMUNITY RATING IN THE

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:57.045
INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP

01:26:57.111 --> 01:26:59.547
MARKETS AND INDEED FOR THE FIRST

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.950
SEVERAL YEARS TO THE ACA WAS NOT

01:27:02.016 --> 01:27:03.918
IN A FACT AND SO IF THE

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:05.219
INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL PLAYER

01:27:05.286 --> 01:27:07.422
MARKETS WERE ALSO EXPERIENCE

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:07.655
RATED.

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.557
SO IT'S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE TO DO

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.060
THIS IN A MARKET THAT IS

01:27:12.126 --> 01:27:14.162
EXPERIENCE RATED AND INDEED IN

01:27:14.228 --> 01:27:15.663
MOST OF INSURANCE.

01:27:15.730 --> 01:27:18.266
PROPERTY HOMEOWNERS AUTO IT'S

01:27:18.333 --> 01:27:20.034
EXPERIENCE RATED AND YET THERE

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:21.369
IS.

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.104
RATE REGULATION WHICH THIS BILL

01:27:23.171 --> 01:27:24.572
DOES NOT PROPOSE THIS BILL DOES

01:27:24.639 --> 01:27:26.608
NOT SAY THAT THE REGULATOR CAN

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.376
SAY YES OR NO IT'S JUST

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:29.911
TRANSPARENCY.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.846
AND SO WE THINK IT'S ENTIRELY

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.047
POSSIBLE TO DO THIS WE

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:34.315
UNDERSTAND.

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:36.050
THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE

01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:37.151
UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T WANT

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:38.653
ANYBODY DOUBLE CHECKING THEIR

01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.587
RATES.

01:27:39.654 --> 01:27:42.023
BUT ONE THOSE OF US WHO ARE THE

01:27:42.090 --> 01:27:45.093
PROPONENTS REPRESENT.

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.761
THE CONSUMERS THE TEN MILLION

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.096
CONSUMERS WHO WORK FOR LARGE

01:27:48.162 --> 01:27:50.531
EMPLOYERS WHO ARE HAVING RATE

HOWEVER FOR A PERIOD OF A TIME

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:05.578

02:13:56.328 --> 02:13:58.663
VERY MUCH STILL A SMALL COMPANY.

02:13:58.730 --> 02:13:59.998
IMPOSING ADDITIONAL BARRIERS

THERE'S THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

02:17:04.783 --> 02:17:05.817
THAT'S GOING TO BE THERE THAT'S

02:17:05.884 --> 02:17:07.919
NOT GONNA -- CAN GET TO DO MORE

02:17:07.986 --> 02:17:10.255
DAMAGE THAN GOOD ABSOLUTELY I

02:17:10.322 --> 02:17:11.423
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

02:17:11.489 --> 02:17:12.958

HAD A CHANCE -- TO GO TO

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.461
ACTUALLY PROTEUS AND HE WORKED

02:17:16.528 --> 02:17:18.229
ALONG WITH MY TEAM MEMBERS TO

02:17:18.296 --> 02:17:19.364
BASICALLY OBSERVE.

02:17:19.431 --> 02:17:20.699
WHAT WHAT THEY DO IN FACT WHEN

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.434
THE MANUFACTURE THE TRACK AND

02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:24.002
WAS JUST AMAZING SO?

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:25.036
THE BOTTOM LINE CONCLUSION THAT

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.738
I MADE IS I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:28.306
ALSO I WANT THEM TO SUCCEED

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:29.574
BECAUSE IF THEY SUCCEED ON

02:17:29.641 --> 02:17:30.709
CALIFORNIA SUCCEED.

02:17:30.775 --> 02:17:32.477
SO HAVING THAT HAVING SAID THAT

02:17:32.544 --> 02:17:33.878
I THINK IT'S A POINT TO POINT

02:17:33.945 --> 02:17:35.447
OUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE.

02:17:35.513 --> 02:17:37.782
TO ALL PROTECT ALSO THE PATIENTS

02:17:37.849 --> 02:17:39.117
INFORMATION JUST THE I DON'T

02:17:39.184 --> 02:17:40.051
WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT

02:17:40.118 --> 02:17:41.286
IT'S I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

02:17:41.353 --> 02:17:43.488
ME TO A JUST TO REITERATE WHAT I

02:17:43.555 --> 02:17:45.490
JUST STATED AT THE GET GO.

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:46.858
AND THAT IS ONE STEP PILL IS

02:17:46.925 --> 02:17:48.293
INGESTED INTO THE BODY THAT

02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.695
TRIGGERS IN AB OPPOSE IT TO THE

02:17:50.762 --> 02:17:52.230
PATCH THAT WE USE HAS SAW

02:17:52.297 --> 02:17:52.998
EARLIER.

02:17:53.064 --> 02:17:54.733
AND THAT WAS START GENERATING

02:17:54.799 --> 02:17:55.400
ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION WHETHER

02:17:55.467 --> 02:17:58.069
IT'S BODY TEMPERATURE OR TIME

02:17:58.136 --> 02:17:59.237
THE BILL WAS TAKEN A SOURCE OF A

02:17:59.304 --> 02:18:00.872
HEART RATE AND ALSO ALL.

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:02.173
THE ALL THAT INFORMATION OUGHT

02:18:02.240 --> 02:18:03.808
TO BE CONSIDERED AS PATIENT

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:05.043
INFORMATION AND THAT SHE OUGHT

02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:06.177
TO BE PRIVATE.

02:18:06.244 --> 02:18:07.846
AND UNFORTUNATELY ON THE CURRENT

02:18:07.912 --> 02:18:09.681
LAW THAT INFORMATION IS NOT

02:18:09.748 --> 02:18:17.088
COVER UNDER HIPAA OR CMI AA.

02:18:17.155 --> 02:18:18.657
BECAUSE THE INFORMATION ONLY

02:18:18.723 --> 02:18:19.524
INFORMATION THAT'S GENERATED AT

02:18:19.591 --> 02:18:20.325
THE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE OR WHEN

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:21.126
IT REACHES THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE

02:18:21.192 --> 02:18:23.194
WOULD BE CONSIDERED A MEDICAL

02:18:23.261 --> 02:18:25.063
INFORMATION UNDER C. M. I. A. O.

02:18:25.130 --> 02:18:25.463
HIPPA.

02:18:25.530 --> 02:18:26.965
BUT WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS

02:18:27.032 --> 02:18:29.401
GENERATED BY THESE DEVICES THEN

02:18:29.467 --> 02:18:31.436
THERE'S THERE'S NO PROTECTION

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:33.138
WHATSOEVER BEFORE IT REACHES THE

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:34.239
DOCTOR'S OFFICE.

02:18:34.305 --> 02:18:36.374
SUIT THAT'S VERY THAT IS THE

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:38.877
VERY NEAR ALL OF THE TIME PERIOD --

02:18:38.943 --> 02:18:41.179
ACTUALLY PASSED ON FROM TRYING

02:18:41.246 --> 02:18:42.647
TO PROTECT I THINK.

02:18:42.714 --> 02:18:43.748
YOU KNOW I THINK TO PUT MORE

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.316
PROTECTION AND SECURITY BROUGH

02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:47.318
PROVIDE TO THE TO THE PALE I

02:18:47.385 --> 02:18:47.952
THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT A BETTER

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:50.055
PRODUCT AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:51.456
THIS THE COMPANIES CAN BE MORE

02:18:51.523 --> 02:18:52.457
SUCCESSFUL SO.

02:18:52.524 --> 02:18:53.525
SO THERE IS A LANGUAGE THAT HAVE

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:57.562
BEEN KIND OF WORKING WILL

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:58.697
WORKING ON SOME LANGUAGE ALSO.

02:18:58.763 --> 02:18:59.364
AND THE IT IN REGARDS TO I MEAN

02:18:59.431 --> 02:19:00.331
PRIVACY IS SOMETHING THAT I

02:19:00.398 --> 02:19:02.634
THINK IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:04.836
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS -- AND

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.037
AT THE MORE AND MORE THEY WERE

02:19:06.104 --> 02:19:07.405
DIGGING INTO IT THE MORE AND

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:09.374
MORE CONCERNING THAT AGES.

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:09.974
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING

02:19:10.041 --> 02:19:12.711
LIKE YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION --

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:14.446
IF THERE'S ANYTHING -- THAT

02:19:14.512 --> 02:19:15.480
SHOULD BE PROTECTED IT WOULD BE

02:19:15.547 --> 02:19:17.148
THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS

02:19:17.215 --> 02:19:18.717
UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:19:18.783 --> 02:19:21.019
WHAT'S THE THE GREAT FEAR WITH

02:19:21.086 --> 02:19:23.121
THIS BILL OF THAT WOULD -- AT

02:19:23.188 --> 02:19:24.622
THAT ARE ARE YOU PUT RIGHT MAYBE

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:26.458
I SHOULD ASK IT THIS WAY DO YOU

02:19:26.524 --> 02:19:27.859
HAVE YOUR OWN -- I'M DO YOU

02:19:27.926 --> 02:19:28.860
UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT PRIVACY

02:19:28.927 --> 02:19:30.762
IS AND HOW TO UNDERSTAND THE

02:19:30.829 --> 02:19:32.997
NECESSITY OF TO HAVE SOME --

02:19:33.064 --> 02:19:34.899
OVERSIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:19:34.966 --> 02:19:38.970
INFORMATION ISN'T BEING USED.

02:19:39.037 --> 02:19:41.039
FOR WAYS IN THE FIRST WITH.

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:41.673
IF I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR THANK

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:42.207
YOU MISTER MAYES FOR THAT

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:44.442
QUESTION -- I THINK THE COMPANY

IS IN QUESTION I CERTAINLY

02:19:46.478 --> 02:19:47.345
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE AT THE

02:19:47.412 --> 02:19:48.546
PIONEER IN THIS FIELD THEY WERE

02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:49.948
THE FIRST TO DEVELOP IT THEY

02:19:50.014 --> 02:19:51.950
WERE THE FIRST AND ONLY. TO

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:52.851
RECEIVE APPROVAL BY THE FOOD AND

02:19:52.917 --> 02:19:54.285
DRUG ADMINISTRATION TO LAUNCH

02:19:54.352 --> 02:19:57.155
THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT -- THE

02:19:57.222 --> 02:19:58.690
MODEL DOESN'T WORK UNLESS THEY

02:19:58.757 --> 02:20:00.425
PROTECT PATIENT DATA THAT IS THE

02:20:00.492 --> 02:20:02.827
CORNERSTONE OF THAT THERE IS THE

02:20:02.894 --> 02:20:04.629
TECHNOLOGY SIDE OF THINGS AND

02:20:04.696 --> 02:20:05.797
THEN THERE'S THE ABILITY TO

02:20:05.864 --> 02:20:07.565
CONVINCE PEOPLE TO USE THAT

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:07.999
TECHNOLOGY.

02:20:08.066 --> 02:20:11.035
AND WITHOUT THE MOST STRINGENT

02:20:11.102 --> 02:20:12.837
COMMITMENT TO DATA PROTECTION.

02:20:12.904 --> 02:20:14.806
IT WOULDN'T WORK AND THE FDA

02:20:14.873 --> 02:20:16.074
PROBABLY WOULDN'T GRANTED THEM

02:20:16.141 --> 02:20:17.909
THE APPROVAL THEY PROBABLY WOULD

02:20:17.976 --> 02:20:19.077
NOT HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP THAT

02:20:19.144 --> 02:20:19.711
THEY HAVE WITH THE ONE

02:20:19.778 --> 02:20:21.412
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY THAT THAT

02:20:21.479 --> 02:20:22.547
IS ENTERED IN THIS PARTNERSHIP

02:20:22.614 --> 02:20:26.484
SO -- YEAH THE COMPANY IS.

02:20:26.551 --> 02:20:28.520
CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THEIR

02:20:28.586 --> 02:20:29.120
OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT PATIENT

02:20:29.187 --> 02:20:33.057
DATA.

02:20:33.124 --> 02:20:34.559
JUST JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT I

02:20:34.626 --> 02:20:36.628
THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:37.929
TECHNOLOGIES YOU SEE THAT'S OUT

02:20:37.996 --> 02:20:39.063
THERE THAT TRULY PUTS THE

02:20:39.130 --> 02:20:40.431
CONSUMER COMPLETELY IN THE

02:20:40.498 --> 02:20:42.367
DRIVER'S SEAT IT'S A COMPLETELY

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:44.135
PATIENT CENTRIC MODEL.

02:20:44.202 --> 02:20:45.170
YOU SEE SO MANY PRODUCTS OUT

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:46.004

02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:47.639
CONSUMERS THE PRODUCT THIS IS

02:20:47.705 --> 02:20:48.840
THE OPPOSITE OF THAT THIS IS A

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:50.542
COMPANY -- TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

02:20:50.608 --> 02:20:52.076
REALLY PIONEERING AND PRIVACY SO

02:20:52.143 --> 02:20:54.679
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF EVERYTHING

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:56.181
THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE AREA.

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:57.248

02:20:57.315 --> 02:20:58.550
SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION --

WHEN YOU'RE THE FIRST AND YOU

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:04.088

PRIVATELY OWNED COMPANY THEY'RE

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:17.135
NOT PUBLICLY TRADED THEY NEED TO

02:21:17.202 --> 02:21:19.037
GO OUT AND RAISE THE CAPITAL

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:19.671
THAT HELPS THEM TO DEVELOP THIS

02:21:19.737 --> 02:21:21.573
TECHNOLOGY -- THEY'VE THEY'VE

02:21:21.639 --> 02:21:23.041
RAISED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:25.276
MONEY TODAY THEY NEED TO RAISE

02:21:25.343 --> 02:21:27.412
MORE BECAUSE WHILE.

02:21:27.478 --> 02:21:31.349
THEY HAVE ROLLED OUT THE SYSTEM

02:21:31.416 --> 02:21:31.916
THEY'RE NOT ACTIVELY ON THE

02:21:31.983 --> 02:21:34.519
MARKET YET -- AND SO YOU KNOW

02:21:34.586 --> 02:21:36.321
DECISIONAL THREATS OF OR EVEN

ONCE THE PATENT EXPIRES.

02:25:01.492 --> 02:25:02.760
IT WILL DO THIS BY PROVIDING A

02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:04.362
PRESUMPTION THAT THESE TYPES OF

AND GENERIC DRUG COMPANIES ARE

02:25:07.298 --> 02:25:08.933
ANTI COMPETITIVE.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.468

THEIR FAVOR.

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:34.292
WHAT IS THAT FAVOR?

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS MORE.

02:25:41.132 --> 02:25:42.600

02:26:36.821 --> 02:26:39.223
THAT WE ABSOLUTELY NEED A BE A

02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.824

02:26:40.791 --> 02:26:42.160
DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN GENERIC

DRUGS FROM ENTERING THE MARKET

02:26:46.097 --> 02:26:47.765
SIMPLY TO DRIVE UP PROFITS.

02:26:47.832 --> 02:26:49.467
THIS MEASURE WOULD ENHANCE

02:26:49.534 --> 02:26:51.269
ENFORCEMENT TOOLS MAKING PAY FOR

02:26:51.335 --> 02:26:53.371

INCREASES YEARLY AND IT'S CLEAR

02:27:11.856 --> 02:27:13.658
TO US THAT PAY FOR DELAY IS A

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:15.493
PROBLEM IN HOW MUCH PRESCRIPTION

02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:17.562
DRUGS COST HEALTH ACCESS HAS A

02:27:17.628 --> 02:27:19.363

WE KNOW THAT AB EIGHT TWENTY

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:26.103
FOUR WILL CERTAINLY HELP WITH

02:27:26.170 --> 02:27:27.538
SOME OF THESE CALLS FROM SOARING

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:30.074
WE COSPONSORED SB TWENTY

02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:30.641
SEVENTEEN AND WE NOW HAVE

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.443
INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AROUND

02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:33.778
PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES.

02:27:33.844 --> 02:27:36.113
CERTAINLY WHEN PRICES SPIKE 8% A

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:38.883
YEAR OR 16% IN TWO YEARS DRUG

02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:40.751
COMPANIES HAVE TO EXPLAIN WHY A

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.486
COST IS SUDDENLY GOING UP.

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:44.322
HOWEVER I'LL TRANSPARENCY LAW

02:27:44.388 --> 02:27:45.690
DOESN'T IMPACT DRUG PRICES THAT

02:27:45.756 --> 02:27:47.558
ARE ARTIFICIALLY HIGH BECAUSE OF

02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:49.060
A LACK OF A LOWER COST

02:27:49.126 --> 02:27:51.128
ALTERNATIVE WHICH IS EXACTLY

02:27:51.195 --> 02:27:53.064
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THESE -- WHEN

02:27:53.130 --> 02:27:55.266
WE HAVE THESE PURPOSEFUL DELAYS

02:27:55.333 --> 02:27:57.868
OF DRUGS GOING ON TO THE MARKET

02:27:57.935 --> 02:27:59.337
SIMPLY TO DRIVE OUT THESE COSTS

02:27:59.403 --> 02:28:01.038
WE BELIEVE EVERYONE SHOULD A FOR

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:02.440
THEIR MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT

02:28:02.506 --> 02:28:03.875
GOING INTO BANKRUPTCY?

02:28:03.941 --> 02:28:04.742
BUT WHEN THESE PHARMACEUTICAL

02:28:09.814 --> 02:28:10.648
AND AND NOT ALLOW LOWER COST

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:12.216
DRUGS GOING TO THE MARKET REALLY

YEARS.

02:29:09.473 --> 02:29:10.975
I'M DURING THIS DELAY CONSUMERS

OFF THE MARKET FOR SIX YEARS.

02:29:34.632 --> 02:29:35.599
DURING THIS TIME SUFFERS

02:29:35.666 --> 02:29:37.335
MANUFACTURER BEAR MADE OVER A

02:29:37.401 --> 02:29:39.136
BILLION DOLLAR IN BILLION

02:29:39.203 --> 02:29:40.905
DOLLARS IN SALES WHAT WAS THE

02:29:40.971 --> 02:29:42.173
PRICE IMPACT TO CONSUMERS.

02:29:42.239 --> 02:29:43.974
SUPER COST OVER FIVE DOLLARS A

TABLET BEFORE GENERIC ENTRY

AFTER GENETIC GENERIC ENTRY THE

02:29:47.745 --> 02:29:50.047
PRICE DROP TO LESS THAN TWENTY

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.615
CENTS A TABLET.

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:52.950
SO WHEN DID THESE AGREEMENTS

02:29:53.017 --> 02:29:55.553
HAPPENED TYPICALLY THEY HAPPEN --

02:29:55.619 --> 02:29:57.455
WHEN THERE'S AFTER AT THE END OF

02:29:57.521 --> 02:29:59.090
A PATENT TIME AFTER A PATENT

02:29:59.156 --> 02:30:01.058
INFRINGEMENT LAWSUIT AND WHAT

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:02.426
MAKES THEM ODD IS THAT IN THAT

02:30:02.493 --> 02:30:03.828
CASE THE PLAINTIFF IS PAYING THE

02:30:03.894 --> 02:30:05.963
DEFENDANT -- AND IS SETTLING THE

02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:07.231
LAWSUIT BY AGREEING TO TRANSFER

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:08.933
SOMETHING OF VALUE TO DELAY ITS

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.134
RIVAL SALES.

02:30:10.201 --> 02:30:11.335
OF ITS COMPETING VERSION OF THE

02:30:11.402 --> 02:30:13.270
BRAND NAME DRUGS THE VALUE THAT

02:30:13.337 --> 02:30:14.338
THE BRAND TRANSFERS COMES IN

02:30:14.405 --> 02:30:16.741
MANY FORMS BUT IT CAN INCLUDE --

02:30:16.807 --> 02:30:18.909
TRANSFERS OF MONEY PROMISES NOT

02:30:18.976 --> 02:30:20.378
TO COMPETE IN OTHER MARKETS

02:30:20.444 --> 02:30:22.113
FORGIVENESS IS OF LIABILITY AND

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:23.948
OTHER SUITS ARE TRANSFERS ARE

02:30:24.014 --> 02:30:26.617
PRODUCTS OF OF LICENSE RIGHT.

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:28.285
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT IT'S HARD

02:30:28.352 --> 02:30:30.221
SOMETIMES TO REALLY SUSS OUT --

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:31.455
THAT THESE ARE PAY FOR DELAY

02:30:31.522 --> 02:30:32.923
AGREEMENTS WHICH IS WHY IT'S

02:30:32.990 --> 02:30:34.859
SHIFTING THE THE PRESUMPTION IS

02:30:34.925 --> 02:30:36.927
SO KEY AND SO IMPORTANT -- THESE

02:30:36.994 --> 02:30:38.062
AGREEMENTS HAVE HARMFUL

02:30:38.129 --> 02:30:40.197
CONSEQUENCES FOR CONSUMERS AS

02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:42.233
WE'VE DISCUSSED -- A COUPLE

02:30:42.299 --> 02:30:45.002
OTHER REALLY QUICK FIGURES I'M A

02:30:45.069 --> 02:30:45.903
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN REPORT BY

02:30:45.970 --> 02:30:47.605
MEDICARE PAID AT BY NET PACK

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.140
FOUND THE GENERIC ONES GENERIC

02:30:49.206 --> 02:30:50.474
DRUGS ENTER.

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:52.410
THE MARKET PLACE DRUG COSTS GO

02:30:52.476 --> 02:30:57.148
DOWN BY 7290%.

02:30:57.214 --> 02:30:58.149
FURTHER A TWO THOUSAND TEN STUDY

02:30:58.215 --> 02:30:59.950
BY THE FTC -- ESTIMATED THAT HE

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:00.818
FOR DELAY AND GREEN MEN'S COST

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.653
CONSUMERS THREE POINT FIVE

02:31:02.720 --> 02:31:03.921
BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND I

02:31:03.988 --> 02:31:04.822
WHAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE

02:31:04.889 --> 02:31:05.956
FACT THAT THAT'S A TWO THOUSAND

02:31:06.023 --> 02:31:07.792
AND TEN STUDY SO IT'S ALREADY

02:31:07.858 --> 02:31:08.426
TEN YEARS THE DATA IS ALREADY

02:31:08.492 --> 02:31:09.393
TEN YEARS OLD.

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:10.861
WE CAN ASSUME THAT THAT THAT

02:31:10.928 --> 02:31:13.364
THAT PRICE IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO

02:31:13.431 --> 02:31:14.598
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OF NOT.

02:31:14.665 --> 02:31:15.966
THIRTY I'M IN THAT SAME TIME

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:17.134
PERIOD.

02:31:17.201 --> 02:31:18.035
AND THIS IS TO GIVE YOU THE

02:31:18.102 --> 02:31:20.070
SCOPE THERE WERE NINE HUNDRED

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.372

TO THE FTC OF THESE AGREEMENTS

02:31:23.474 --> 02:31:24.708
THE FTC HAS ALREADY.

02:31:24.775 --> 02:31:26.610
IDENTIFIED MORE THAN A HUNDRED

02:31:26.677 --> 02:31:27.878
OF THEM TO BE POTENTIAL PAY FOR

GO AFTER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE

02:31:37.521 --> 02:31:39.156
COMPLEX AND TILTED IN FAVOR OF

02:31:39.223 --> 02:31:40.558
THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.

02:31:40.624 --> 02:31:41.759
ALTHOUGH COURTS HAVE HELD THAT

02:31:41.826 --> 02:31:42.793
THESE AGREEMENTS MAYBE

02:31:42.860 --> 02:31:44.428
CHALLENGES ANTI COMPETITIVE AND

SCRUTINY FROM THE COURTS BECAUSE

02:31:50.301 --> 02:31:52.536
THE LEGAL STANDARDS. FOR THESE

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:54.371

COMPLEXITY AND UNCERTAINTY TO

02:31:57.308 --> 02:31:58.676
THEIR ADVANTAGE TO DROP THE

UNFORTUNATELY.

02:35:08.165 --> 02:35:09.533
WE ARE FINDING AT THIS POINT

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:11.301
BECAUSE OF SOME THE ANTICS AND

02:35:11.368 --> 02:35:12.936
AND SOME OF THE ON GOING WITH

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:14.905
THE PATENT HOLDERS THE BRAND

02:35:14.972 --> 02:35:16.173
DRUG COMPANIES.

02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:18.142
AND THE EVER GREENING OF PATENTS

02:35:18.208 --> 02:35:19.743
AND PATENT TICKETS THAT HAS BEEN

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:24.815
BEST WAYS TO GET A GENERIC TO

02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:26.784
MARKET SOONER THAN THE PATENT

02:35:26.850 --> 02:35:28.285

02:35:28.352 --> 02:35:29.853
WE SUPPORT THE INNOVATIVE WORK

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:31.822
BEING DONE BY THE BY THE PATENT

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:33.824
DRUG COMPANIES WITHOUT THEM WE

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:35.325
WOULD NOT HAVE GENERICS.

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:38.028
BUT 78% OF ALL NEW PATENTS IN

02:35:38.095 --> 02:35:39.430
THE ORANGE BOOK OR FOR EXISTING

02:35:39.496 --> 02:35:41.031

02:35:48.105 --> 02:35:49.840
IN ONE STUDY THE TOP TWELVE

HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT PATENTS.

02:35:54.445 --> 02:35:56.146
X. SHIELDING THEM FROM GENERIC

02:35:56.213 --> 02:35:57.514
COMPETITION FOR THIRTY EIGHT

02:35:57.581 --> 02:35:59.016
YEARS [inaudible]

02:35:59.083 --> 02:35:59.950
GENERIC.

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:02.319
MANUFACTURERS SUPPORT LAWS THAT

02:36:02.386 --> 02:36:04.588
STOP THIS TYPE OF PATTON ABUSE.

02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:05.723
PAN SETTLEMENTS ARE ONE OF THE

02:36:05.789 --> 02:36:06.924
MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS GENERIC

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.592
MANUFACTURERS HAVE IN ENDING

02:36:08.659 --> 02:36:10.327
THIS EVER GREENING.

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:12.830
PROCESS I'D LIKE -- TO JUST DO

02:36:12.896 --> 02:36:15.099
REAL BRIEF OVERVIEW OF HOW MANY

02:36:15.165 --> 02:36:16.600
OF THESE CASES COME ABOUT --

02:36:16.667 --> 02:36:18.368
BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S OFTEN

02:36:18.435 --> 02:36:19.369
MIS UNDERSTANDING.

02:36:19.436 --> 02:36:20.738
TYPICALLY A GENERIC COMPANY WILL

02:36:20.804 --> 02:36:23.540
FILE WITH THE FDA FOR APPROVAL --

02:36:23.607 --> 02:36:25.008
TO BRING A DRUG TO MARKET.

02:36:25.075 --> 02:36:26.610
THEY MUST SHOW THAT IT HAS THE

02:36:26.677 --> 02:36:28.212
SAME ACTIVE INGREDIENT THAT IT

02:36:28.278 --> 02:36:29.646
HAS BIOLOGICALLY QUICK ONCE IN

02:36:29.713 --> 02:36:30.981
ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR WHAT'S

02:36:31.048 --> 02:36:32.516
CALLED IN PREHEATED NEW DRUG.

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:35.052
APPLICATION IN THIS PROCESS THEY

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.653
HAVE TO CERTIFY.

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:38.989
THAT -- HOW THEY ARE GOING TO

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.424
DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL PATENTS

02:36:40.491 --> 02:36:41.391
IN AND THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT

02:36:41.458 --> 02:36:42.659
WAYS OF DOING IT?

02:36:42.726 --> 02:36:44.828
ONE THEY CAN SHOW THAT NO PAN

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:46.029
EXISTS.

02:36:46.096 --> 02:36:48.098
PATENTS EXPIRED OR PATTON WILL

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:49.500
EXPIRE THE WAR OFTEN THE

02:36:49.566 --> 02:36:50.501
SETTLEMENT SO WE'RE TALKING

02:36:50.567 --> 02:36:52.002
ABOUT TODAY COME THROUGH WHAT'S

02:36:52.069 --> 02:36:53.103
CALLED THE PARAGRAPH.

02:36:53.170 --> 02:36:54.004
FOUR WHERE THEY HAVE TO SHOW

02:36:54.071 --> 02:36:56.874
THAT THE PATENTS INVALID OR THEY

02:36:56.940 --> 02:37:00.344
WILL NOT INFRINGE ON THE PATTERN

02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:01.945
THAT EXISTS.

02:37:02.012 --> 02:37:03.046
THE SETTLEMENTS ARE REALLY

02:37:03.113 --> 02:37:05.382
WHAT'S THAT AGAIN THE FOCUS OF

02:37:05.449 --> 02:37:07.217
AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR AND EIGHT

02:37:07.284 --> 02:37:08.585
AM IS PRIMARY CONCERN.

02:37:08.652 --> 02:37:10.287
WITH THIS IS HOW THIS BILL SEEKS

02:37:10.354 --> 02:37:11.722
TO PREVENT THE LARGE AN

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:13.157
UNEXPLAINED AND REFERS PAYMENTS

02:37:13.223 --> 02:37:15.959
WHICH MAYBE NOT BE JUSTIFIED.

02:37:16.026 --> 02:37:18.195
A. M. GREECE WITH THIS.

02:37:18.262 --> 02:37:20.898
THIS PROCESS.

02:37:20.964 --> 02:37:21.899
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE BILL

02:37:21.965 --> 02:37:24.501
ACTUALLY CREATES A DISINCENTIVE

02:37:24.568 --> 02:37:25.502
FOR GENERIC MANUFACTURERS FROM

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:27.137
AN AGGRESSIVELY ATTACKING THE

02:37:27.204 --> 02:37:28.405
PATENT THICKET.

02:37:28.472 --> 02:37:29.473
THE BILL CREATES A PRESUMPTION

02:37:29.540 --> 02:37:31.208
THAT THE U. S. SUPREME COURT

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:33.110
EXPRESSLY REJECTED AGAIN AND

02:37:33.177 --> 02:37:34.311
ACTIVISTS.

02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:36.480
THEY MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT

02:37:36.547 --> 02:37:38.248
THAT THIS TYPE OF PRESUMPTION

02:37:38.315 --> 02:37:39.783
WAS NOT NECESSARY.

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:41.585
SINCE THE ACT OF THIS CASE MANY

02:37:41.652 --> 02:37:43.253
OFTHE NUMBERS THAT -- I THINK

02:37:43.320 --> 02:37:44.388
YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THE

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:46.890
PROPONENTS OF ACTUALLY -- BEEN

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:49.259
REDUCED IN FACT FROM A HIGH OF

02:37:49.326 --> 02:37:50.961
THIRTY THREES AND SETTLEMENTS

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:53.063
THAT -- THEY CLAIMED.

02:37:53.130 --> 02:37:55.833
WERE -- RESULTED IN PROBLEMATIC

02:37:55.899 --> 02:37:57.000
LANES.

02:37:57.067 --> 02:37:59.369
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ONLY FIVE OUT

02:37:59.436 --> 02:38:01.138
OF ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONCE

02:38:01.205 --> 02:38:04.708
YOU SUBTRACT THE IDEA OF THE

02:38:04.775 --> 02:38:06.410
GENERIC MANUFACTURE BEING ABLE

02:38:06.476 --> 02:38:09.379
TO COLLECT THEIR LEGAL COSTS --

02:38:09.446 --> 02:38:12.049
THE THE PROOF IS REALLY SHOWN

02:38:12.115 --> 02:38:13.450
THAT ACTIVISTS SINCE ACTIVISTS

02:38:13.517 --> 02:38:15.219
THESE TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS HAVE

02:38:15.285 --> 02:38:16.119
GONE DOWN.

02:38:16.186 --> 02:38:17.588
AB EIGHT TWENTY FOUR ELIMINATES

02:38:17.654 --> 02:38:19.256
ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TOOLS

02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:21.124
AGAINST PATENT THICKETS AGAIN IN

02:38:21.191 --> 02:38:24.061
TYPICAL CASE IT IS THE BRAND

02:38:24.127 --> 02:38:25.562
MANUFACTURER WHO IS BRINGING A

02:38:25.629 --> 02:38:26.897
LAWSUIT AGAINST THE GENERIC

02:38:26.964 --> 02:38:28.198
MANUFACTURE.

02:38:28.265 --> 02:38:29.833
IF WITHOUT CLEAR GUIDELINES

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:31.835
GENERIC MANUFACTURERS ARE HIGHLY

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:34.137
UNLIKELY OR WILL HAVE A MUCH

02:38:34.204 --> 02:38:37.107
MORE DIFFICULT TIME. TO ATTACK

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:38.375
THE PATENTS.

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:39.476
SETTLEMENTS HAVE SAVED BILLIONS

02:38:39.543 --> 02:38:40.777
OF DOLLARS FOR PATIENTS IN

02:38:40.844 --> 02:38:43.780
STATES.

02:38:43.847 --> 02:38:45.182
I THINK.

02:38:45.249 --> 02:38:47.351
IF I COULD I AND AND I WE HAVE

02:38:47.417 --> 02:38:49.519
ABOUT TWO MINUTES LEFT I

02:38:49.586 --> 02:38:54.958
APPRECIATE THAT -- FOR FOR YET.

02:38:55.025 --> 02:38:56.894
WE SALUTE THE GO AHEAD.

02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.028
YEAH DAHLE JUST KIND OF

02:38:58.095 --> 02:38:59.196
SUMMARIZE WHAT REAL QUICK --

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.531
SOME OF THE THE SUITS THAT ARE

02:39:01.598 --> 02:39:02.766
SOME HAVE ARGUED THAT SU SHOULD

02:39:02.833 --> 02:39:04.568
BE ARGUED FINALITY BUT THERE'S

02:39:04.635 --> 02:39:07.471
INHERENT RISK IN THAT AS WELL

02:39:07.537 --> 02:39:08.772
SIXTY FOUR OUT OF EIGHTY NINE

02:39:08.839 --> 02:39:10.073
CLAIMS THAT WENT TO TRIAL FOUND

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.108
PATENT INFRINGEMENTS.

02:39:11.174 --> 02:39:13.477
THAT MEANS THAT 70% OF THE TIME

02:39:13.543 --> 02:39:15.312
THE GENERIC MANUFACTURERS LOST A

02:39:15.379 --> 02:39:17.714
COURT WHEN THEY LOSE THEY ARE

02:39:17.781 --> 02:39:23.687
UNABLE TO COME TO MARKET SOONER.

02:40:29.286 --> 02:40:30.287
TO DISCUSS THIS BILL WITH US

02:40:30.354 --> 02:40:32.055
BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO FIND A

02:40:32.122 --> 02:40:33.390
PLACE TO LAND WITH THIS BILL

02:40:33.457 --> 02:40:34.925
ANTS ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

02:40:34.992 --> 02:40:36.026
POSITION.

02:40:36.093 --> 02:40:37.394
BUT PATENT SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS

02:40:37.461 --> 02:40:39.796
ARE ALREADY REVIEWED BY THE FTC

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:41.198
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

02:40:41.264 --> 02:40:42.265
AND THEY REVIEW THESE

02:40:42.332 --> 02:40:44.468
SETTLEMENTS TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK

02:40:44.534 --> 02:40:45.736
FOR PROVISIONS THAT WOULD MAKE

02:40:45.802 --> 02:40:47.037
THESE AGREEMENTS ANTI

02:40:47.104 --> 02:40:48.205
COMPETITIVE.

02:40:48.271 --> 02:40:49.873
THE FRAMEWORK FOR LEGAL REVIEW

02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:51.041
WAS DEVELOPED BY THE UNITED

02:40:51.108 --> 02:40:52.476
STATES SUPREME COURT AND THE

02:40:52.542 --> 02:40:57.214
CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS A

02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:57.814
SIMILAR FRAMEWORK.

02:40:57.881 --> 02:40:58.682
IF THE STATE OR THE FTC BELIEVES

02:40:58.749 --> 02:40:59.383
THERE ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE

02:40:59.449 --> 02:41:00.751
PROVISIONS.

02:41:00.817 --> 02:41:01.752
THEY CAN THEN CHALLENGE THE

02:41:01.818 --> 02:41:03.653
AGREEMENT AND THEY HAVE BEEN

02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:05.055
VERY ACTIVE IN THIS AREA.

02:41:05.122 --> 02:41:06.623
THESE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS CAN

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.358
BRING GENERIC DRUGS AND

02:41:08.425 --> 02:41:10.994
BIOSIMILAR. TO MARKET SOONER AND

02:41:11.061 --> 02:41:13.463
DO NOT EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE

02:41:13.530 --> 02:41:15.165
PATENT FOR THE BRAND DRUG OR THE

02:41:15.232 --> 02:41:16.666
BIOLOGIC.

02:41:16.733 --> 02:41:18.602
THEY ALSO RESOLVED THE GREAT

02:41:18.668 --> 02:41:20.670
UNCERTAINTY OR RISK FOR THE

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:23.173
BRAND AND GENERIC MANUFACTURERS

02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:25.008
SETTLEMENTS BRING FINALITY AND

02:41:25.075 --> 02:41:27.344
THE ALLOW GENERIC EQUIVALENTS TO

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:28.278
MOVE FORWARD.

02:41:28.345 --> 02:41:30.247
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT PLACING

02:41:30.313 --> 02:41:31.748
RESTRICTIONS ON SETTLEMENTS AS

02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:33.984
THIS BILL DOES NOW MAY PREVENT

02:41:34.051 --> 02:41:34.751
THESE AGREEMENTS FROM OCCURRING

02:41:34.818 --> 02:41:35.552
AT ALL.

02:41:35.619 --> 02:41:36.887
THIS MEANS THAT BRANDON GENERIC

02:41:36.953 --> 02:41:39.056
COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO LITIGATE

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:42.192
THEIR DISPUTE TO THE END THERE

02:41:42.259 --> 02:41:42.692
WOULD BE NO SETTLEMENT.

02:41:42.759 --> 02:41:44.428
A RECENT STUDY THAT LOOKED AT

02:41:44.494 --> 02:41:45.662
LITIGATION FOUND AN INNOVATOR

02:41:45.729 --> 02:41:47.364
COMPANIES PREVAILED IN THE

02:41:47.431 --> 02:41:48.432
MAJORITY OF CASES.

02:41:48.498 --> 02:41:50.033
IF A GENERIC COMPANY LOSES

02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:52.302
CHALLENGE IT WOULD IT WOULD

02:41:52.369 --> 02:41:53.603
ENTER THE MARKET.

02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:55.205

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:56.339
BEFORE.

02:41:56.406 --> 02:41:57.874
THEREFORE THIS BILL MAY HAVE THE

02:41:57.941 --> 02:41:59.142
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF

02:41:59.209 --> 02:42:01.878
INCREASING AVERAGE EXCLUSIVITY

02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:03.547
PERIOD FOR BRAND DRUGS NOT

02:42:03.613 --> 02:42:04.781
SHORTENING.

02:42:04.848 --> 02:42:06.249

THAT THE BIGGEST.

02:43:18.488 --> 02:43:23.760
CHANGES IS THE THAT THE

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:24.895

IT'S THE HEART OF THE BILL -- I

02:43:42.212 --> 02:43:43.113
THINK WHAT THE CHALLENGES WE

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.581
HAVE WITH THESE WITH THE F. T.

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:46.983
C. -- AND HOW THESE SETTLEMENTS

02:43:47.050 --> 02:43:49.386
ARE MADE IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:43:49.452 --> 02:43:52.389
THE ABILITY TO REALLY -- IS TO

02:43:52.455 --> 02:43:53.957
PENETRATE TO UNDERSTAND THESE

02:43:54.024 --> 02:43:56.092

HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT

02:43:57.928 --> 02:43:59.396
THAT THAT THE SETTLEMENTS

02:43:59.462 --> 02:44:01.164
ACTUALLY MIGHT HELP GENERICS TO

02:44:01.231 --> 02:44:02.933
GET TO THE MARKET SOONER THAT'S

02:44:02.999 --> 02:44:04.901
NOT WHAT WE'RE SEEING -- WERE

02:44:04.968 --> 02:44:06.870
ACTUALLY SEEN -- SO FASCINATED

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:09.706
WE HAVE -- THE GENERICS HERE WHO

02:44:09.773 --> 02:44:10.674
ARE GETTING MONEY FROM

02:44:10.740 --> 02:44:13.043
SETTLEMENTS TO NOT PRODUCE DRUGS

02:44:13.109 --> 02:44:15.078
AND THE DRUG COMPANIES HERE BOTH

02:44:15.145 --> 02:44:17.147
IN OPPOSITION TO THAT THAT THAT

02:44:17.214 --> 02:44:18.648
TO ME -- IS IS IT IS AN

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:21.151
INTERESTING MARRIAGE -- AND SO

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:22.385
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:44:22.452 --> 02:44:24.287
PENETRATE THESE DICK AGREEMENTS

02:44:24.354 --> 02:44:25.021
TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT IS

02:44:25.088 --> 02:44:27.557
GOING ON SO WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING.

02:44:27.624 --> 02:44:29.893
IF AS I WAS TOLD OF THAT THESE

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.127
THE SOME THESE AGREEMENTS ARE

02:44:31.194 --> 02:44:32.629
PRO COMPETITIVE.

02:44:32.696 --> 02:44:34.164
THAN JUST PROVE IT TO US IT'S A

02:44:34.231 --> 02:44:37.100
SIMPLE AS THAT -- AND IF YOU YOU

02:44:37.167 --> 02:44:38.969
KNOW AND THE BECAUSE IT

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:40.403
CERTAINLY DOESN'T LOOK THAT WAY

02:44:40.470 --> 02:44:45.308
WHEN A PLAINTIFF SUES SOMEBODY.

02:44:45.375 --> 02:44:46.710
AND THEN THE PLANE IT PAYS. FOUR

02:44:46.776 --> 02:44:47.344
IN THE SETTLEMENT THAT DOESN'T

02:44:47.410 --> 02:44:49.079
LOOK RIGHT AND THAT AND AT THE

02:44:49.145 --> 02:44:50.313
END OF THE DAY WHAT WE KNOW IS

02:44:50.380 --> 02:44:51.948
THAT THESE DRUGS ARE THESE

02:44:52.015 --> 02:44:53.316
GENERIC DRUGS ARE DELAYED AND

02:44:53.383 --> 02:44:54.517
ARE NOT GETTING THE MARKET.

02:44:54.584 --> 02:44:55.652
AND CONSUMERS.

02:44:55.719 --> 02:44:57.587
AND EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING THE

02:44:57.654 --> 02:44:58.488
PRICE FOR THAT AND IT'S BEEN

02:44:58.555 --> 02:45:02.859
GOING ON FOR A LONG LONG TIME.

02:45:02.926 --> 02:45:03.426
SEVERAL OF MY OWN AND THEN I

02:45:03.493 --> 02:45:04.427

THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR

02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:08.765
BOTH SIDES ON THIS.

02:45:08.832 --> 02:45:10.800
AND THE OPPOSITION IT MENTIONED

02:45:10.867 --> 02:45:13.003
IN THE STATEMENT THAT WE WANT TO

02:45:13.069 --> 02:45:15.171
GET TO THE SAME PLACE WHAT IS

02:45:15.238 --> 02:45:19.643
THAT SAME PLACE.

02:45:22.112 --> 02:45:23.947
I THINK THE SAME PLACE IS WHERE

02:45:24.014 --> 02:45:25.348
WE ARE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING

02:45:25.415 --> 02:45:27.484
CHANT A GENERIC MANUFACTURERS TO

02:45:27.550 --> 02:45:28.184
COME TO MARKET AS SOON AS

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:28.918
POSSIBLE.

02:45:28.985 --> 02:45:30.587
I WOULD SAY WE AGAIN WE AGREE

02:45:30.654 --> 02:45:32.589
WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WE NEED TO

02:45:32.656 --> 02:45:34.224
DEAL WITH AND GENERIC COMPANIES

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.725
ARE NOT IN SUPPORT AS FAR AS THE

02:45:35.792 --> 02:45:37.193
ASSOCIATION I CAN'T SAY THAT

02:45:37.260 --> 02:45:38.928
THERE AREN'T SOME OUTLYING CASES

02:45:38.995 --> 02:45:40.297
BECAUSE THEY DO OCCUR.

02:45:40.363 --> 02:45:43.066
BUT IF WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE

02:45:43.133 --> 02:45:44.534
CASES THAT HAVE LARGE AND

02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:46.736
UNEXPLAINED MONETARY SETTLEMENTS

02:45:46.803 --> 02:45:48.405
THAT ARE NOT JUSTIFIED.

02:45:48.471 --> 02:45:49.606
THOSE CASES SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE

02:45:49.673 --> 02:45:51.708
OF AND WE BELIEVE THAT SINCE

02:45:51.775 --> 02:45:54.678
ACTIVISTS AS HAS BEEN.

02:45:54.744 --> 02:45:55.645
IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE U. S.

02:45:55.712 --> 02:45:57.280
SUPREME COURT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN

02:45:57.347 --> 02:45:58.982
WE HAVE SEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:00.650
DROP IN THE NUMBER OF THESE

02:46:00.717 --> 02:46:02.886
QUESTIONABLE CASES WE'RE DOWN TO

02:46:02.952 --> 02:46:04.921
FIVE OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND THEN

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:07.123
SEVENTY CASES I BELIEVE THAT'S

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.824
ABOUT 3%.

02:46:07.891 --> 02:46:10.694
WE DO NOT SIT HERE IN SUPPORT

02:46:10.760 --> 02:46:13.229
THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES THOSE

02:46:13.296 --> 02:46:15.465
TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS THAT THE

02:46:15.532 --> 02:46:17.400
AUTHOR IS TALKING ABOUT AND SO.

02:46:17.467 --> 02:46:19.402
TO ME THAT'S THERE THE COMMON

02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:20.270
GROUND THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE

02:46:20.337 --> 02:46:22.639
TO REACH IS LET'S FIND A WAY TO

02:46:22.706 --> 02:46:24.007
BETTER TAKE CARE OF WHETHER IT'S

02:46:24.074 --> 02:46:25.942
INSTANT STATE LEGISLATION OR

02:46:26.009 --> 02:46:27.711
WHETHER IT'S IN -- ON GOING

02:46:27.777 --> 02:46:30.146
FEDERAL LEGISLATION WE SHOULD

02:46:30.213 --> 02:46:32.382
TAKE CARE OF THOSE TYPES OF

02:46:32.449 --> 02:46:35.618
OUTLYING CASES.

02:46:35.685 --> 02:46:37.287
THANK YOU WE WOULD ALSO AGREE

02:46:37.354 --> 02:46:39.956
WITH THAT THAT STATE AND I THINK --

02:46:40.023 --> 02:46:41.291
THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS THAT

02:46:41.358 --> 02:46:42.559
WHILE THE INTENTION IS IS

02:46:42.625 --> 02:46:44.227
LAUDABLE HERE IT'S IT'S MOVING

02:46:44.294 --> 02:46:45.662
THE NEEDLE TOO FAR THE OTHER WAY.

02:46:45.729 --> 02:46:48.031
THERE COULD BE A DISINCENTIVE TO

02:46:48.098 --> 02:46:49.199
ARRANGE A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS.

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:51.101
THANK YOU AND FOR THE SUPPORT

02:46:51.167 --> 02:46:52.635

MADE IT'S SAID THAT THERE WAS

02:46:54.070 --> 02:46:55.338
CONCERN.

02:46:55.405 --> 02:46:58.174
THAT THIS TILTED IT TOO MUCH IN

02:46:58.241 --> 02:47:00.343
FAVOR OF THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:47:00.410 --> 02:47:01.644

02:47:01.711 --> 02:47:03.446
PHARMACEUTICALS WHAT ARE WE

02:47:03.513 --> 02:47:05.715
DOING TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T TILT

02:47:05.782 --> 02:47:07.951
IN FAVOR OF ANY SIDE BUT WE KEEP

02:47:08.017 --> 02:47:12.889

02:47:19.662 --> 02:47:20.997
IS THAT WE HAVE.

02:47:21.064 --> 02:47:22.732
NOT ONLY WE HAVE A PRESUMPTION

02:47:22.799 --> 02:47:25.802
SHIFT BUT IN ORDER -- FOR THESE

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:27.604
AGREEMENTS TO BE PRESUMED ACT

02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:29.406
ANTI COMPETITIVE -- WE FIRST

02:47:29.472 --> 02:47:31.508
HAVE TO SHOW THAT THERE WAS

02:47:31.574 --> 02:47:33.543
SOMETHING OF VALUE TRANSFERRED

02:47:33.610 --> 02:47:34.844
AND THEN WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT

02:47:34.911 --> 02:47:36.446
THERE ARE -- THAT THAT IT

02:47:36.513 --> 02:47:38.948
CREATED A DELAY IN -- THE ENTRY

02:47:39.015 --> 02:47:39.649
OF THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE

02:47:39.716 --> 02:47:42.152

WHY THEY SHOULD BE PRESUMED ANTI

02:47:52.295 --> 02:47:53.563
COMPETITIVE SO I THINK WE DO

02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:55.665
HAVE A GOOD BALANCE RIGHT NOW --

02:47:55.732 --> 02:47:57.167
FOR THESE TYPES OF CASES GIVEN

02:47:57.233 --> 02:47:59.335

IS NECESSARY TO TO SHIP THE

02:48:10.547 --> 02:48:11.881
PRESUMPTION AS WE HAVE BECAUSE

02:48:11.948 --> 02:48:13.183
IT'S SO FAR IN FAVOR OF THE

02:48:13.249 --> 02:48:14.083

IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SEE --

02:48:17.153 --> 02:48:18.922

LITIGATION IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

02:48:21.157 --> 02:48:26.129

CASES SUCCESSFULLY IN AND AND

02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:29.032
PREVAIL IN COURT.

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:30.433
THANK YOU I GUESS FROM MY

02:48:30.500 --> 02:48:32.402
PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:33.036
FOR ME IS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

02:48:33.102 --> 02:48:35.004
THAT PEOPLE GET THE MEDICINE

02:48:35.071 --> 02:48:36.973
THEY NEED AND THEY CAN AFFORD IT --

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:39.142
AND SO THE IDEA THAT IT'S STILL

02:48:39.209 --> 02:48:40.710
TOO TOO MUCH ON ONE SIDE I JUST

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.479
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER

02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:44.881
SIDES THERE ARE THAT WE STAY AT

02:48:44.948 --> 02:48:45.915
A PLACE WHERE WE CAN STILL

02:48:45.982 --> 02:48:47.317
ACHIEVE THAT AND WE'RE WE'RE NOT

02:48:47.383 --> 02:48:48.318
TAKING AWAY.

02:48:48.384 --> 02:48:51.054
OUR PRODUCT AWAY FROM -- FROM

02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:53.022
CONSTITUENTS THAT WE SERVE -- I

02:48:53.089 --> 02:48:54.524
HAVE HEARD IT YOU KNOW THE

02:48:54.591 --> 02:48:55.992
OPPOSITION SAY THAT THEY WOULD

02:48:56.059 --> 02:48:58.328
LIKE TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.430
CAN ME IN IN THE MIDDLE AND I

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:01.965
DON'T EVEN IF MIDDLES THE RIGHT

02:49:02.031 --> 02:49:02.899
WORD WHERE WE CAN.

02:49:02.966 --> 02:49:03.800
MAYBE MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT

02:49:03.867 --> 02:49:05.168
WORD BUT WHERE WE COULD REACH

02:49:05.235 --> 02:49:07.003
SOME CONSENSUS OR SOME AGREEMENT

02:49:07.070 --> 02:49:08.838
AND I HOPE -- THAT WERE ARE WE

02:49:08.905 --> 02:49:10.974
ARE ABLE TO DO THAT -- I THINK

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:13.576
THAT -- IT WOULD BE IF IF THERE

02:49:13.643 --> 02:49:15.912
IS A WILLING INTEREST ON THE

02:49:15.979 --> 02:49:17.814
OPPOSITION SIDE TO GET TO A

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:19.349
PLACE WHERE SOME OF THIS IS

02:49:19.415 --> 02:49:22.151
MANAGEABLE -- NOT ALL OF IT OUT

02:49:22.218 --> 02:49:24.287
BUT HE EIGHT THINK THAT THERE'S

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:25.655
REALLY VALUE IN TRYING TO

02:49:25.722 --> 02:49:27.824

CONSTITUENTS GET THE MEDICINE

02:49:32.295 --> 02:49:34.330
THEY NEED -- AND AND THINK ABOUT

02:49:34.397 --> 02:49:35.965
WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS THIS COULD

02:49:36.032 --> 02:49:43.039

02:50:49.038 --> 02:50:50.139
INCREASE OF COST.

02:50:50.206 --> 02:50:51.841
WHEN WE LOOK AT HOW MANY

02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:54.243
FAMILIES ARE GOING BANKRUPT

02:50:54.310 --> 02:50:55.778

LAW DO YOU THINK THAT.

02:51:14.130 --> 02:51:19.268
WE WILL SEE LOWER DRUG PRICES.

THAT IS ABSOLUTELY THE HOPE --

02:51:24.107 --> 02:51:26.309
THE THE IDEA IS THAT IF THIS IS

02:51:26.376 --> 02:51:28.778
THAT THAT'S AS AS PRACTICE --

02:51:28.845 --> 02:51:31.180
DELAYS THE INTRODUCTION OF OF

02:51:31.247 --> 02:51:32.949
GENERIC DRUGS.

02:51:33.016 --> 02:51:34.317
IF WE CAN SPEED UP THE PIPELINE

02:51:34.384 --> 02:51:36.085
ABSOLUTELY CONSUMERS WILL SEE A

02:51:36.152 --> 02:51:37.920
DECREASE IN PRICES THAT IS THE

02:51:37.987 --> 02:51:40.223
END GOAL HERE SO -- IF THAT'S

02:51:40.289 --> 02:51:41.491

PRESUME ANY OF THE FOLLOWING IS

02:52:10.687 --> 02:52:12.188
A LIST OF THINGS THAT THE FACT

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:13.456
FINDER CAN'T PRESUME.

02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:14.123
LIKE THAT ENTRY INTO THE MARKET

02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:15.391
PLACE COULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED

02:52:15.458 --> 02:52:16.426
UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE

02:52:16.492 --> 02:52:17.727
RELEVANT PATENT EXCLUSIVITY THAT

02:52:17.794 --> 02:52:19.996
ANY PATENTS ENFORCEABLE IN

02:52:20.063 --> 02:52:20.530
FRENCH COUPLE OTHER THINGS

02:52:20.596 --> 02:52:20.830
[inaudible]

02:52:20.897 --> 02:52:22.498
DOES THAT.

02:52:22.565 --> 02:52:23.366
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

02:52:23.433 --> 02:52:25.368
PRESUMED NOW AND THEN AND IT'S

02:52:25.435 --> 02:52:27.403
BEEN CHANGED OR YOU JUST

02:52:27.470 --> 02:52:30.406
CLARIFYING THAT -- THE FACT

02:52:30.473 --> 02:52:31.007
FINDER SHOULDN'T ASSUME THESE

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:32.275
THINGS EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT

02:52:32.341 --> 02:52:34.677
ALREADY.

02:52:34.744 --> 02:52:36.012
OR IT IS GOOD BECAUSE IT.

02:52:36.079 --> 02:52:36.913
I'M READING IT THAT THE NUMBERS

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:38.314
HAVING IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.

02:52:38.381 --> 02:52:39.916
IT'S JUST SORT OF A BLANK SLATE

02:52:39.982 --> 02:52:40.917
AND THEY'RE GONNA WEIGH THE

02:52:40.983 --> 02:52:42.385
EVIDENCE AND THEY'RE GONNA SEE

02:52:42.452 --> 02:52:42.919
IF IT MEETS THE CLEAR AND

02:52:42.985 --> 02:52:46.089
CONVINCING STANDARD BUT I WANNA

02:52:46.155 --> 02:52:46.723
MAKE SURE I'M UNDERSTANDING THAT

02:52:46.789 --> 02:52:47.156
PART RIGHT.

02:52:47.223 --> 02:52:48.024
RIGHT NOW THESE CASES ARE ALL

02:52:48.091 --> 02:52:49.292
HANDLED WITH THE FEDERAL TRADE

02:52:49.358 --> 02:52:51.127
COMMISSION SO WHAT WE ARE TO

02:52:51.194 --> 02:52:52.962
SIMPLE WE'RE SIMPLY DOING IS

02:52:53.029 --> 02:52:54.897
CHANGING THE PRESUMPTION -- UP

02:52:54.964 --> 02:52:56.866
FRONT -- NOW I'M I'M NOT AN

02:52:56.933 --> 02:52:59.969
ATTORNEY -- THERE ARE OTHER

02:53:00.036 --> 02:53:00.603
ATTORNEYS IN THE ROOM I DON'T IF

02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:02.138
YOU NOTICE THAT.

02:53:02.205 --> 02:53:03.806
BUT BUT I WOULD GUILTY ACTUALLY

02:53:03.873 --> 02:53:05.475
ASKED THE ATTORNEY FROM -- THE

02:53:05.541 --> 02:53:06.109
TRAIN GENERAL'S OFFICE TO ANSWER

02:53:06.175 --> 02:53:07.844
THAT QUESTION.

02:53:07.910 --> 02:53:08.144
THANK YOU.

02:53:08.211 --> 02:53:10.279
SO -- WHAT WHAT THIS THAT THIS

02:53:10.346 --> 02:53:12.014
PROVISION IN THE BILL DOES IS

02:53:12.081 --> 02:53:14.517
THAT IT -- BASICALLY FOR BED

02:53:14.584 --> 02:53:15.918
CERTAIN PERCEPTIONS WITHOUT

02:53:15.985 --> 02:53:18.287
EVIDENCE -- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

02:53:18.354 --> 02:53:20.790
WHAT WE HAVE FOUND IN CASES IS

02:53:20.857 --> 02:53:23.426
THAT -- FACT FINDERS WILL ASSUME

02:53:23.493 --> 02:53:24.794
THAT IF THERE'S A PATENT THAT

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:26.195
IT'S VALID AND WE'RE IN THE

02:53:26.262 --> 02:53:28.064
POSITION THEN OF PROVING THE

02:53:28.131 --> 02:53:29.732
UNDER UNDERLYING PATENT

02:53:29.799 --> 02:53:31.000
INFRINGEMENT CASE WHICH IS NOT

02:53:31.067 --> 02:53:33.369
THE REASON THAT WHERE IN COURT

02:53:33.436 --> 02:53:34.537
IN THE FIRST PLACE WE'RE DEALING

02:53:34.604 --> 02:53:35.304
WITH THE ANTI COMPETITIVE

02:53:35.371 --> 02:53:37.273
BEHAVIOR -- AND THAT'S JUST ONE

02:53:37.340 --> 02:53:38.374
OF THE PRESUMPTIONS BUT

02:53:38.441 --> 02:53:39.742
ESSENTIALLY IT DOES CREATE

02:53:39.809 --> 02:53:40.743
SOMETHING OF A BLANK SLATE I

02:53:40.810 --> 02:53:42.278
THINK THAT IT'S IT'S TILTED IN

02:53:42.345 --> 02:53:43.446
FAVOR RIGHT NOW THIS TO MEAN

02:53:43.513 --> 02:53:44.981
CERTAIN THINGS AND SO WE'RE

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:46.382
TELLING THE FACT FINDER.

02:53:46.449 --> 02:53:48.818
DON'T PRESUME THAT WITHOUT

02:53:48.885 --> 02:53:50.953
EVIDENCE.

02:53:51.020 --> 02:53:53.389
THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU.

02:53:53.456 --> 02:53:55.491
MR FOR DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION

02:53:55.558 --> 02:53:57.460
AND WASN'T SURE IF NOT.

02:53:57.527 --> 02:53:58.194
OKAY.

02:53:58.261 --> 02:54:00.163
SURE IF YOU DON'T MIND IF I

02:54:00.229 --> 02:54:01.330
COULD IF I COULD GIVE.

02:54:01.397 --> 02:54:03.099
PERHAPS ONE EXAMPLE IT AT THIS

02:54:03.166 --> 02:54:04.400
POINT I THINK IT MIGHT HELP

02:54:04.467 --> 02:54:05.902
CLARIFY SOME OF THE REASONS WHY

02:54:05.968 --> 02:54:07.603
JUNIOR COMPANIES SURE DO SUPPORT

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:09.205
THE ABILITY FOR THESE -- THESE

02:54:09.272 --> 02:54:11.073
PATENTS IN FACT THE THIS CASE

02:54:11.140 --> 02:54:13.876
ACTUALLY WASN'T -- JUDICATA BY A

02:54:13.943 --> 02:54:15.912
TYPICALLY A GENERIC COMPANY BUT

02:54:15.978 --> 02:54:17.547
WAS A BRAND COMPANIES WHO WAS

02:54:17.613 --> 02:54:20.016
SUED BY A NOTHER BRAND COMPANY.

02:54:20.082 --> 02:54:21.217
BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO

02:54:21.284 --> 02:54:23.586
BRING A BY A SLIM SIMILAR TO

02:54:23.653 --> 02:54:23.820
MARKET.

02:54:23.886 --> 02:54:26.522
THEY ENDED UP IN AN AGREEMENT

02:54:26.589 --> 02:54:29.091
THAT ACTUALLY RESULTED IN ELEVEN

02:54:29.158 --> 02:54:31.127
YEARS BEING REDUCED FROM THE

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:32.762
LENGTH OF THE PATENT.

02:54:32.829 --> 02:54:33.930
THAT MEANS THAT A BIOSIMILAR FOR

02:54:33.996 --> 02:54:35.364
THE IN THIS HAPPENS TO BE THE

02:54:35.431 --> 02:54:36.999
TOP SELLING DRUG IN THE WORLD

02:54:37.066 --> 02:54:37.800
THREE POINT THREE BILLION

02:54:37.867 --> 02:54:39.135
DOLLARS SPENT BY MEDICARE AND

02:54:39.202 --> 02:54:39.836
MEDICAID.

02:54:39.902 --> 02:54:41.904
ALONE IN ONE YEAR THAT

02:54:41.971 --> 02:54:43.506
BIOSIMILAR IS NOT GONNA BE ABLE

02:54:43.573 --> 02:54:45.308
TO COME TO MARKET SOONER BECAUSE

02:54:45.374 --> 02:54:46.642
OF A SETTLEMENT.

02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:48.444
THOSE ARE PRO COMPETITIVE

02:54:48.511 --> 02:54:49.579
SETTLEMENTS THAT WE ARE HERE TO

02:54:49.645 --> 02:54:51.113
TRYING TO TRYING TO PROTECT AND

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:52.982
I BELIEVE IS THE GOAL OF THE

02:54:53.049 --> 02:54:54.317
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO OF OF

02:54:54.383 --> 02:54:56.385
MISTER CHAIRMAN TO PROTECT THOSE

02:54:56.452 --> 02:54:57.053
TYPES OF SUPPLEMENTS AS WELL.

02:54:57.119 --> 02:54:58.988
OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVE TO

02:54:59.055 --> 02:55:00.356
GET THIS RIGHT IT'S A VERY

02:55:00.423 --> 02:55:02.325
DIFFICULT VERY TECHNICAL SECTION

02:55:02.391 --> 02:55:03.326
OF LAW.

02:55:03.392 --> 02:55:06.128
IN IF WE GET IT WRONG AND WE

02:55:06.195 --> 02:55:08.331
START TO DISINCENTIVE EYES THE

02:55:08.397 --> 02:55:11.767
GENERIC MANUFACTURERS.

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:12.535
WHETHER THEY'RE A BRAND COMPANY

02:55:12.602 --> 02:55:13.903
OR A GENERIC COMPANY -- FROM

02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:15.371
BRINGING THESE PATENT CHALLENGES

02:55:15.438 --> 02:55:16.572
WE WILL NOT HAVE MORE

02:55:16.639 --> 02:55:18.241
COMPETITION IN THE DRUG SPACE

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:20.009
AND WE WILL NOT REDUCE COSTS AND

02:55:20.076 --> 02:55:22.545
SO THAT'S OUR PRIMARY CONCERN.

02:55:22.612 --> 02:55:23.713
SO I THINK MITCHELL I THINK MISS

02:55:23.779 --> 02:55:25.948
LIMóN WAS TRYING TO GET AT THAT --

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:27.183
AND I WANT TO MAYBE.

02:55:27.250 --> 02:55:28.584
ASK THAT QUESTION AGAIN MISTER

02:55:28.651 --> 02:55:29.952
MICHELIN SO HOW DO WE DO THAT --

02:55:30.019 --> 02:55:32.655
BECAUSE THE WHAT WHEN I HEAR --

02:55:32.722 --> 02:55:36.259
PAY FOR DELAY -- I THINK THAT

02:55:36.325 --> 02:55:37.593
YOU'VE GOT PRIVATE ACTORS THAT

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:38.527
ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE

02:55:38.594 --> 02:55:40.930
MARKET AS YOU KNOW IN IN THIS

02:55:40.997 --> 02:55:42.365
COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THOSE PATENTS

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:44.467
WE GIVE PEOPLE A THAT MONOPOLY

02:55:44.533 --> 02:55:47.303
RIGHT -- BECAUSE OF THE OF OF

02:55:47.370 --> 02:55:48.404
ALL THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

02:55:48.471 --> 02:55:49.438
THAT GOES INTO IT AND KNOWING

02:55:49.505 --> 02:55:50.673
THAT YOU'VE GOT TO GET A GOOD

02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.008
RETURN ON INVESTMENT BUT IT IT.

02:55:52.074 --> 02:55:53.876
IT THERE'S ONLY A PERIOD OF TIME

02:55:53.943 --> 02:55:55.845
IN WHICH IT ENDS AND OF COURSE

02:55:55.912 --> 02:55:57.546
IF YOU BEGIN TO MANIPULATE THE

02:55:57.613 --> 02:55:59.482
MARKET TO YOUR OWN YOUR OWN --

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:01.417
AND THEN THAT'S WHEN GOVERNMENT

02:56:01.484 --> 02:56:03.019
DOES HAVE TO STEP IN I DON'T

02:56:03.085 --> 02:56:04.921
LIKE WHEN GOVERNMENT HAS TO STEP

02:56:04.987 --> 02:56:06.789
IN BUT AT SOME POINT IF THERE'S

02:56:06.856 --> 02:56:08.491
MARKET FAILURE THAT'S A ROLE FOR

02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:09.592
GOVERNMENT TO COME IN THAT'S WHY

02:56:09.659 --> 02:56:10.626
WE HAVE ANTI TRUST.

02:56:10.693 --> 02:56:12.328
A RULES -- A FEDERAL ANTI TRUST

02:56:12.395 --> 02:56:13.729
RULES SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:56:13.796 --> 02:56:15.665
MONOPOLIES ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE

02:56:15.731 --> 02:56:17.066
SO HOW DO WE GET TO THAT AND HOW

02:56:17.133 --> 02:56:18.367
DO WE FIX DO YOU GUYS HAVE A

02:56:18.434 --> 02:56:20.169
PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE.

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:21.537
TO A TO GET THERE.

02:56:21.604 --> 02:56:23.739
YEAH SO -- SURE LET'S TAKE WITH

02:56:23.806 --> 02:56:25.341
FARM -- WE'VE BEEN -- MEETING

02:56:25.408 --> 02:56:26.809
WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S

02:56:26.876 --> 02:56:29.312
OFFICE AND AUTHORS OFFICE TO TRY

02:56:29.378 --> 02:56:30.980
TO GET TO A MIDDLE GROUND HERE.

02:56:31.047 --> 02:56:32.415
SO PART OF IT IS THAT THE BILL

02:56:32.481 --> 02:56:33.916
CREATES A FRAMEWORK THAT

02:56:33.983 --> 02:56:35.851
ACTUALLY DOES THREE THINGS ONE

02:56:35.918 --> 02:56:37.687
IT'S THE PRESUMPTION THAT THESE

02:56:37.753 --> 02:56:39.622
ARE ANTI COMPETITIVE. TWO EIGHT

02:56:39.689 --> 02:56:41.490
RAISES THE EVIDENCE STANDARD TO

02:56:41.557 --> 02:56:43.659
OVERCOME WHETHER THE AGREEMENT

02:56:43.726 --> 02:56:45.795
IS NOT ANTI COMPETITIVE AND THEN

02:56:45.861 --> 02:56:48.030
AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF

02:56:48.097 --> 02:56:49.298
JUST ALLUDED TO THERE'S A

02:56:49.365 --> 02:56:51.067
PRESUMPTION SAID THEY JUDGE --

02:56:51.133 --> 02:56:53.869
OR THE FACT FINDER IN THIS CASE

02:56:53.936 --> 02:56:54.870
THERE'S A CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

02:56:54.937 --> 02:56:57.173
THAT THEY HAVE TO MAKE OR CAN'T

02:56:57.239 --> 02:56:59.241
MAKE AND IN THE BILL AND SO I

02:56:59.308 --> 02:57:00.443
THINK THAT THERE'S A MIDDLE

02:57:00.509 --> 02:57:02.411
GROUND SOMEWHERE BTWEEN THE

02:57:02.478 --> 02:57:03.879
RULE OF REASON THAT'S THE

02:57:03.946 --> 02:57:05.548
CURRENT FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED

02:57:05.614 --> 02:57:07.283
THREE SUPREME COURT AND THEN.

02:57:07.350 --> 02:57:13.489
THE THREE THE THREE PIECES THAT

02:57:13.556 --> 02:57:15.324
ARE CREE RATED BY THIS BILL THAT

02:57:15.391 --> 02:57:15.992
PUT A HEAVY HAND ON DETERMINING

02:57:16.058 --> 02:57:17.727
THAT THESE AGREEMENTS ARE ANTI

02:57:17.793 --> 02:57:18.060
COMPETITIVE.

02:57:18.127 --> 02:57:18.661
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE ISN'T

02:57:18.728 --> 02:57:19.996
ANY THERE'S NOT DISAGREEMENT THE

02:57:20.062 --> 02:57:21.630
FACT THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM --

02:57:21.697 --> 02:57:22.965
MY HEARING THAT CORRECTLY THAT

02:57:23.032 --> 02:57:25.201
THERE ARE THERE ARE ACTORS THAT

02:57:25.267 --> 02:57:26.836
ARE ACTUALLY BEHAVING

02:57:26.902 --> 02:57:28.604
INAPPROPRIATELY AND THEY ARE

02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:30.940
MANIPULATING THE MARKET IS THAT

02:57:31.007 --> 02:57:32.608
IS THAT ACCURATE.

02:57:32.675 --> 02:57:33.175
WHICH IS WHY WE'VE TAKEN AN

02:57:33.242 --> 02:57:34.677
OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION

02:57:34.744 --> 02:57:36.145
INSTEAD OF AN OPPOSE POSITION

02:57:36.212 --> 02:57:38.447
BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET TO A

02:57:38.514 --> 02:57:41.083
MIDDLE GROUND ON THIS.

02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:42.318
DOCTOR WHAT ARE JUST AS THE

02:57:42.385 --> 02:57:45.354
FIRST I'VE HEARD THAT THEM ADMIT

02:57:45.421 --> 02:57:46.188
THAT THERE ARE ACTORS ACTUALLY.

02:57:46.255 --> 02:57:47.189
THIS BEHAVIOR SO THAT'S THAT'S A

02:57:47.256 --> 02:57:48.524
STEP FORWARD I THINK THAT'S

02:57:48.591 --> 02:57:50.459
PROGRESS REGARDING MR MICHELIN'S

02:57:50.526 --> 02:57:51.227
COMMENTS THERE'S ACTUALLY

02:57:51.293 --> 02:57:52.561
EXEMPTION THE BILL THAT

02:57:52.628 --> 02:57:54.130
ADDRESSES THE ISSUE HE JUST HE

02:57:54.196 --> 02:57:54.997
BROUGHT UP.

02:57:55.064 --> 02:57:57.266
SO -- THE ITEM NUMBER SECTION

02:57:57.333 --> 02:57:59.101
THAT IS BUT THAT I DO KNOW THAT

02:57:59.168 --> 02:58:00.569
THERE IS AN EXEMPTION THERE.

02:58:00.636 --> 02:58:02.571
WITH REGARDS -- TO IF YOU KEEP

02:58:02.638 --> 02:58:04.373
HEARING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT AT

02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:07.410
TVS AND AND THAT PARTICULAR BILL --

02:58:07.476 --> 02:58:08.778
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES A

02:58:08.844 --> 02:58:12.214
DIFFERENT -- STANDARD A REVIEW --

02:58:12.281 --> 02:58:14.683
AND THE THAT IS THAT IS WHAT WE

02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:16.052
ARE TRYING TO DO SO WE'RE NOT

02:58:16.118 --> 02:58:18.087
TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT -- THAT

02:58:18.154 --> 02:58:19.622
CASE WE'RE TO SIMPLY TRYING TO

02:58:19.688 --> 02:58:21.023
ESTABLISH A DIFFERENT STANDARD

02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:23.692
OF REVIEW -- IF THESE ARE IF

02:58:23.759 --> 02:58:24.760
THESE AGREEMENTS TRULY ARE PRO

02:58:24.827 --> 02:58:27.263
COMPETITIVE THEN IT SHOULDN'T BE

02:58:27.329 --> 02:58:29.165
THAT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THEM --

02:58:29.231 --> 02:58:30.533
AND SO IF THE PENDULUM IS

02:58:30.599 --> 02:58:32.168
SWINGING THE OTHER WAY IT'S

02:58:32.234 --> 02:58:34.470
BECAUSE THE MARKET OR THE THE

02:58:34.537 --> 02:58:36.906
THE DRUG PRODUCERS WHETHER THERE%

02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:37.506
AND THIS CASE.

02:58:37.573 --> 02:58:38.808
WILL LOVE THE GENERICS IN THERE

02:58:38.874 --> 02:58:40.643
AS WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING

02:58:40.709 --> 02:58:41.277
THE SETTLEMENTS IN ONE FORM OR

02:58:41.343 --> 02:58:42.044
ANOTHER.

02:58:42.111 --> 02:58:44.280
IF THE THEY HAVE HAD THIS

02:58:44.346 --> 02:58:46.315
PROTECTION FOR MANY MANY YEARS

02:58:46.382 --> 02:58:47.783
AND AS YOU POINT OUT.

02:58:47.850 --> 02:58:49.819
WE HAVE PATENT PROTECTIONS THIS

02:58:49.885 --> 02:58:51.420
IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS AND YOU

02:58:51.487 --> 02:58:53.055
HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT PADS

02:58:53.122 --> 02:58:54.757
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS

02:58:54.824 --> 02:58:56.759
IT'S ABOUT COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR.

02:58:56.826 --> 02:58:58.527
AND AND ONE ENTITY TRYING TO

02:58:58.594 --> 02:59:00.729
STIFLE THE MARKET AND AND ****

02:59:00.796 --> 02:59:05.401
AND COMPETITION THERE SO -- IT.

02:59:05.468 --> 02:59:06.368
THAT REALLY IS I THINK GEN IT

02:59:06.435 --> 02:59:07.603
GERMANE TO THE ISSUE WE'RE NOT

02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:09.238
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT PATENTS

02:59:09.305 --> 02:59:10.973
IS ABOUT THE BEHAVIOR.

02:59:11.040 --> 02:59:12.108
AND WE'VE HAD ACTUALLY HEARD

02:59:12.174 --> 02:59:13.175
FROM FORMER THAT ACTUALLY SAID

02:59:13.242 --> 02:59:14.143
THAT THEY WERE THEY NOW

02:59:14.210 --> 02:59:15.411
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS ACTUALLY

02:59:15.478 --> 02:59:16.245
EXISTS IN THE MARKET SO I

02:59:16.312 --> 02:59:17.646
BELIEVE THAT'S A STEP FORWARD I

02:59:17.713 --> 02:59:19.181
THANK THEM FOR ADMITTING THAT.

02:59:19.248 --> 02:59:21.484
BUT I'D I'D I STILL WHETHER IT'S

02:59:21.550 --> 02:59:23.252
PAY FOR DELAY IN A CASH FOR OR

02:59:23.319 --> 02:59:25.588
PAY FOR DELAY IN OTHER FORMS

02:59:25.654 --> 02:59:27.289
THAT -- ARE DIFFICULT TO

02:59:27.356 --> 02:59:29.058
CIRCUMVENT OR TO TO TO FERRET

02:59:29.125 --> 02:59:30.759
OUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:59:30.826 --> 02:59:32.795
FIND BECAUSE AS THERE HAVE BEEN

02:59:32.862 --> 02:59:34.497
CRACKDOWNS ON THESE ON THESE

02:59:34.563 --> 02:59:35.331
BEHAVIORS.

02:59:35.397 --> 02:59:36.832
THE MARKET OR THE MARK OR THE

02:59:36.899 --> 02:59:38.300
DRUG MANUFACTURERS HAVE CHANGED

02:59:38.367 --> 02:59:39.568
THE WAY TEY STRUCTURE THESE

02:59:39.635 --> 02:59:42.037
AGREEMENTS IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT

02:59:42.104 --> 02:59:43.839
TO GET THE INFORMATION ABOUT

02:59:43.906 --> 02:59:45.241
THESE AGREEMENTS WITHOUT A

02:59:45.307 --> 02:59:46.709
SUBPOENA TO THE FTC.

02:59:46.775 --> 02:59:49.044
AND SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE SO

02:59:49.111 --> 02:59:50.980
WE'RE JUST SAYING LOOK IT'S

02:59:51.046 --> 02:59:52.148
REALLY STRANGE HOW ALL OF A

02:59:52.214 --> 02:59:54.016
SUDDEN THIS DRUG WHICH WAS

02:59:54.083 --> 02:59:55.951
SCHEDULED -- TO THE GENERIC WAS

02:59:56.018 --> 02:59:57.686
SCHEDULED TO COME IN AND AND AND

02:59:57.753 --> 02:59:59.622
PRODUCES DRUG HAS DELAYED FOR A

02:59:59.688 --> 03:00:01.423
YEAR THAT SUSPICIOUS WHY DID

03:00:01.490 --> 03:00:02.424
THEY DELAY THAT.

03:00:02.491 --> 03:00:04.493
WE'RE ASKING IS THIS A IS THIS

03:00:04.560 --> 03:00:06.262
AN ANTI COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR AND

03:00:06.328 --> 03:00:07.730
WHERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:09.331
FORWARD AND ASKED US QUESTIONS

03:00:09.398 --> 03:00:10.966
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT -- AT THE

03:00:11.033 --> 03:00:12.501
END OF THE DAY CONSUMERS

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:14.203
CONTINUE TO PAY HIGH PRICES AND

03:00:14.270 --> 03:00:17.706
THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THIS ENTIRE

03:00:17.773 --> 03:00:19.241
ISSUE.

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:20.209
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE AND I'M

03:00:20.276 --> 03:00:21.177
LOOKING AT MR KNOW WHERE COSTS --

I THINK OUR FEELING IS WE NEED

03:00:30.319 --> 03:00:31.820
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE SETTLEMENTS

03:00:37.826 --> 03:00:38.093
SETTLEMENTS.

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:39.161
THERE'S AN AGREEMENT BEFORE THE

03:00:39.228 --> 03:00:41.897
PATENT EXPIRES WHICH WOULD ALLOW

03:00:41.964 --> 03:00:43.132
THE GENERIC TO START IN THE

03:00:43.199 --> 03:00:44.300
MARKET SOONER.

03:00:44.366 --> 03:00:45.601
AND WE THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS

03:00:45.668 --> 03:00:48.370
CONSTRUCTED NOW IS VERY WORKABLE

03:00:48.437 --> 03:00:50.239
WE THINK WE GET TO A POINT BUT

03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:52.641
WE THINK IT IN IN ITS CURRENT

03:00:52.708 --> 03:00:53.943
FORM TO DISCOURAGE SETTLEMENTS

BENEFITS OF WELLNESS PROGRAMS WE

03:11:40.188 --> 03:11:41.523
SEE THAT EMPLOYERS WILL JUST

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:42.824
ESSENTIALLY STOP OFFERING THESE

03:11:42.891 --> 03:11:44.192

WELLNESS PLAN.

03:12:03.178 --> 03:12:03.945
SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT CIVIL

03:12:04.012 --> 03:12:05.680

AS WELL AS CRIMINAL LIABILITY

03:12:12.854 --> 03:12:14.723
AND WITH THOSE KIND OF THREATS

03:12:14.789 --> 03:12:16.558
ESSENTIALLY -- FOR AN EMPLOYER

03:12:16.625 --> 03:12:18.260

03:12:18.326 --> 03:12:19.461
THAT THEY SEE AS AN ADDED

03:12:19.527 --> 03:12:20.962
BENEFIT TO THE EMPLOYEE THERE

03:12:21.029 --> 03:12:22.597
CENTURY GOING TO STOP DOING THAT

03:12:22.664 --> 03:12:23.899
FOR THAT SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY

03:12:23.965 --> 03:12:25.533

HEALTHCARE COSTS ARE INCREASING

03:12:36.544 --> 03:12:37.812
WE THINK THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD

03:12:37.879 --> 03:12:39.347
ENCOURAGE WELLNESS PROGRAMS

03:12:39.414 --> 03:12:40.916

OF COURSE HEALTH PLANS DO WORK

03:12:57.265 --> 03:12:58.400
WITH EMPLOYERS TO DEVELOP THESE

03:12:58.466 --> 03:12:59.701

03:13:09.311 --> 03:13:10.979
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH

EXISTING LAW -- IN OTHER ISSUES --

03:13:44.679 --> 03:13:46.848
WHEELS HAVEN'T SEEN ANY EXAMPLES

03:13:46.915 --> 03:13:48.917
OF OF THIS -- ANY PROBLEMS IN

03:13:48.984 --> 03:13:50.885

USE OF THESE PROGRAMS WHICH WE

03:14:06.301 --> 03:14:08.403

OUTCOME BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT

03:14:10.238 --> 03:14:11.773

03:16:07.122 --> 03:16:08.690
MASS SCALE SO JUST WANTED TO

03:16:08.756 --> 03:16:09.691

03:16:36.184 --> 03:16:37.852
