01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:14.548
OUR MISSION BUT REALLY THE

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:16.249
ENFORCEMENT WORK THAT WE DO

01:44:16.316 --> 01:44:17.684

OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AG

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:34.468
COMMISSIONERS OF CALIFORNIA IS

01:44:34.534 --> 01:44:36.470
A VERY COMPLIMENTARY ONE. AND

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:38.171
THE FACT IS THEY DO A LOT OF

PANDEMIC HAS ALSO CONTINUES. OF

01:44:49.249 --> 01:44:50.984
QUITE ENERGETICALLY AND QUITE

01:44:51.051 --> 01:44:52.719
VIGOROUSLY WE HAVE OVER THE

A HUNDRED YEARS IT WAS

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:07.668

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.415

COMMENT ON THAT PROGRAM AND

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:01.441
COULD THAT BE A MODEL THAT

PROGRAM YOU KNOW IT'S STILL

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:15.055
JUST TWO OR THREE YEARS OLD SO

01:48:15.121 --> 01:48:17.190

THAT REACHES ALL OF THE FOLKS

01:48:22.863 --> 01:48:24.764
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IT SHOULD

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.932
BUT I THINK THAT REPRESENTS.

01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:27.200
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.135
POTENTIALLY BUILD UPON TO

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:30.604
ESTABLISH A BROADER STATEWIDE

01:48:30.670 --> 01:48:33.707
NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IN FACT I'M

01:48:33.773 --> 01:48:35.709
ON MY WAY TO THE SENATE ALLEY

01:48:35.775 --> 01:48:37.744

01:48:45.518 --> 01:48:46.720
WHAT NOTIFICATION COULD LOOK

01:48:46.786 --> 01:48:48.922
LIKE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.523
I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:48:50.590 --> 01:48:51.491
CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:48:51.558 --> 01:48:54.728

REDUCTION OF CREW POISONINGS

01:49:41.041 --> 01:49:43.610
FROM DRAFT AND THEN

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:44.544
CONSEQUENTLY REDUCTION IN

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.746
LIABILITY IN SIMILARLY I THINK

THAT'S BEEN FUNDED TO SEEK THE

01:51:01.755 --> 01:51:04.657
ALTERNATIVES TO PESTICIDES THAT

01:51:04.724 --> 01:51:07.660

EXPOSURE OF PESTICIDE AT THAT

01:51:19.005 --> 01:51:20.473
TIME AND I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER

01:51:20.540 --> 01:51:21.808
THE NAME OF IT WILL BAN MANY

01:51:21.875 --> 01:51:27.147
YEARS BUT. I THINK PHONE BILL

01:51:27.213 --> 01:51:28.415

DISEASE AND DOC SO IT'S A

01:51:32.318 --> 01:51:35.088
PUBLIC SAFETY OF PUBLIC HEALTH

ABOUT THE SUCCESSES. OF THE

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:10.356
PROGRAM THAT WE RUN FOR THE

01:52:10.423 --> 01:52:12.759
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. WE DO A

01:52:12.826 --> 01:52:14.094
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT GRANT

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.128
PROGRAMS SOMETHING CALLED

01:52:15.195 --> 01:52:18.064
ALLIANCE. PROGRAM FOCUSES MORE

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:20.366
ON. COMMUNITY BASED AND I

01:52:20.433 --> 01:52:22.168
SUPPOSE NON ACADEMIC EFFORTS

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:22.902
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME

01:52:22.969 --> 01:52:25.205
ACADEMICIANS THAT APPLIED AND

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:26.773
RECEIVED THOSE GRANTS. AND THEN

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.675
THERE ARE OUR BASIC RESEARCH

01:52:28.741 --> 01:52:31.077
GRANTS WHICH WE- PROVIDE TO ACT

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:34.747
MAKES MANY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:52:34.814 --> 01:52:40.520
CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR TO ALL.

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:43.590
TO EGGMAN TO VETERANS. THE MORE

01:52:43.656 --> 01:52:44.991
APPROPRIATE WAYS TO CERTAIN HAS

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:45.692
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:47.627
IMPORTANT INVESTMENT THAT THE

01:52:47.694 --> 01:52:49.429
DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO MAKE IN

01:52:49.496 --> 01:52:50.563
OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:52:50.630 --> 01:52:52.532
SCIENCE BEHIND PESTICIDES IN

01:52:52.599 --> 01:52:54.100
OUR EVOLUTION FRANKLY FROM

01:52:54.167 --> 01:52:55.768
RELIANCE ON THE HARDER

01:52:55.835 --> 01:52:58.304
INDUSTRIES TO LOOKING FOR THE

01:52:58.371 --> 01:53:00.106
ALTERNATIVES THAT YOU MENTIONED

01:53:00.173 --> 01:53:01.374
PERHAPS THE GREENER PERHAPS THE

01:53:01.441 --> 01:53:03.476
SOFTER CHEMISTRIES INTEGRATED

01:53:03.543 --> 01:53:05.345
PEST MANAGEMENT APPROACH IS

01:53:05.411 --> 01:53:07.514
THAT THE I THINK THAT WORK

01:53:07.580 --> 01:53:09.115
GROUP THAT I REFERENCED AT THE

01:53:09.182 --> 01:53:10.383
TOP OF MY REMARKS WILL WILL

01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:14.020
FULLY COVER. SO PART OF WHAT

01:53:14.087 --> 01:53:15.688
YEAR'S BUDGET ON THE ONE.

01:53:15.755 --> 01:53:17.891
APPROVAL OF THAT UP A SET

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:19.526
AMOUNT OF MONEY TO DO CORPORATE

01:53:19.592 --> 01:53:21.928
COST PACIFIC GRANT RELATED WORK

01:53:21.995 --> 01:53:24.531
AND CDFA HAD A PIECE OF THAT AS

01:53:24.597 --> 01:53:26.432
WELL AND- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS

01:53:26.499 --> 01:53:28.268
OF BUILDING THOSE GRANTS AND I

01:53:28.334 --> 01:53:30.370
THINK THAT. ALSO HELPS INDUSTRY

01:53:30.436 --> 01:53:32.105
WHICH HAD RELIED FOR MANY YEARS

01:53:32.172 --> 01:53:34.407
ON FOR YOUR OF US THE BROAD

01:53:34.474 --> 01:53:36.776
SPECTRUM PESTICIDE USED. ON

01:53:36.843 --> 01:53:37.744
ABOUT SIXTY DIFFERENT APPS FROM

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:41.614
ALL. IT WAS EXPENSIVE IT WAS

01:53:41.681 --> 01:53:42.649
VERY FACT AND A RESULT IT WAS

SUBJECT OF BOILS DOWN TO

02:41:32.749 --> 02:41:35.585

CALIFORNIA IT'S A- COMPETITION

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:41.591
BETWEEN US AND OTHER STATES TO

02:41:48.165 --> 02:41:51.435
BEST CLIMATE FOR RACING. WE

02:41:51.501 --> 02:41:53.336

OF POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS

02:41:55.505 --> 02:41:56.673
I BELIEVE THAT EXERCISE

02:41:56.740 --> 02:42:00.811
FLEXIBILITY- WHEN NECESSARY BUT

02:42:00.877 --> 02:42:03.547

AMOUNT IS OF THE TO THE

02:42:11.688 --> 02:42:14.825
COMPETITORS OF EACH RACE OTHER

STATES HAVE CASINOS AND SOLD NO

02:42:16.193 --> 02:42:19.796
REVENUE TENDS TO INCREASE THE

02:42:19.863 --> 02:42:21.231
AMOUNT THAT THEY COMPETE FOR

02:42:21.298 --> 02:42:23.900
SHIPPING OR CROSS COUNTRY THAT

02:42:23.967 --> 02:42:27.771
EXPENSE ANYMORE BUT WE ARE

02:42:27.838 --> 02:42:30.740

RIDING CROP RULE OUT. IT IS

02:43:14.885 --> 02:43:16.386
GOING TO BE THE DISTRICT THIS

02:43:16.453 --> 02:43:18.221
ROLE- THAT WILL ONLY ALLOW

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:21.558
JOCKEYS TO USE IT IN A DOWNWARD

02:43:21.625 --> 02:43:24.861
MOTION SIX TIMES MAXIMUM WITH

02:43:24.928 --> 02:43:26.129
THE PAUSE IN BETWEEN. IT IS BY

02:43:26.196 --> 02:43:29.132
FAR THE MOST RESTRICTIVE. OF

02:43:29.199 --> 02:43:35.305
WAR IN WAR. THIS IS SOMETHING.

02:43:35.372 --> 02:43:35.772
IS SOMETHING THAT THE

02:43:35.839 --> 02:43:38.842
GOVERNMENT OF THE STATE. YOU US

02:43:38.909 --> 02:43:40.277
STATES TO COME UP WITH THE

02:43:40.343 --> 02:43:41.745
NATIONAL STANDARD BECAUSE THAT

02:43:41.811 --> 02:43:44.648
DID NOT HAPPEN WE WENT AHEAD

02:43:44.714 --> 02:43:45.649
AND WE IMPLEMENTED THIS VERY

02:43:45.715 --> 02:43:48.051
STRICTER USE OF THE WRITING

02:43:48.118 --> 02:43:49.452
SURE THE JOCKEYS THAT WE WILL

02:43:49.519 --> 02:43:51.488
WILL TAKE VERY UP CLOSE TO MAKE

02:43:51.555 --> 02:43:54.324
SURE THAT THERE IS. USING IN

02:43:54.391 --> 02:43:55.959
JEOPARDY BUT I DOUBT VERY

02:43:56.026 --> 02:43:58.862
SERIOUSLY ORGANIS E. INTO

02:43:58.929 --> 02:43:59.462
LEADING BECAUSE WE'VE LED THE

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:02.499
WAY ON ON UNINITIALIZED RIDING

02:44:02.566 --> 02:44:04.534
CROP SO I BELIEVE THAT WE WILL

02:44:04.601 --> 02:44:07.404
CONTINUE TO BE WAY BECAUSE

02:44:07.470 --> 02:44:11.208

POWER AS THE BOARD- THE

02:44:27.757 --> 02:44:29.726
QUESTION IS EXERCISING THAT

02:44:29.793 --> 02:44:32.028
POWER AND WHERE THE BALANCE IS

02:44:32.095 --> 02:44:36.166
TO PUSH. UP FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF

02:44:36.233 --> 02:44:39.536
THAT LAND TOWARDS LESS DEATHS

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:41.605
OF HORSES I GUESS IF THE ONLY

02:44:41.671 --> 02:44:42.639
AND THERE'S A LOT OF

02:44:42.706 --> 02:44:44.441
CONVERSATION THAT CAN BE HAD

02:44:44.507 --> 02:44:46.843
THERE- IN TERMS OF THE RACING

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:49.312
SURFACES FOR EXAMPLE LET ME

02:44:49.379 --> 02:44:50.680
JUST TAKE SANTA ANITA. SHOULD

02:44:50.747 --> 02:44:52.382

ORDERED. ACTUALLY WEIGH IN ON

02:45:11.701 --> 02:45:13.870
THINGS LIKE WHETHER A SURFACE

02:45:13.937 --> 02:45:16.172
SHOULD BE REPLACED OR NOT- THAT

02:45:16.239 --> 02:45:17.374
MIGHT BE A QUICK SIMPLE

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:19.776

02:46:29.045 --> 02:46:31.047
PROFESSIONAL LIVES INDUSTRY IT

02:46:31.114 --> 02:46:33.750
IS CRITICAL THAT BECAUSE HORSES

THAT IS THE DIRECTION THATWE

02:47:52.629 --> 02:47:53.897

02:48:07.777 --> 02:48:09.345
ANSWER. BUT I THINK THERE'S NEW

02:48:09.412 --> 02:48:11.347
TECHNOLOGY AND NOT SUBSIDIARIES

02:48:11.414 --> 02:48:12.515

AND FACT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO

02:49:00.063 --> 02:49:03.066
VOTED- THAT THE TAX SHOULD BE

02:49:03.132 --> 02:49:04.701
