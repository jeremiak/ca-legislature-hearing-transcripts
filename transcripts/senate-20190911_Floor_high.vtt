00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:23.956
CLEARLY. I WORKED ABOUT FIVE

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:29.261
ARRIVED AT MY OFFICE AT ABOUT

00:15:29.328 --> 00:15:30.195
SEVEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING AND

00:15:30.262 --> 00:15:32.197

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.114
THING THAT I HAD TO DO IN THE

00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:18.584
MORNING I FORGET EXACTLY WHAT

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:23.989
TIME WAS SO. EIGHT SOMETHING.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.625
AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:30.262
PLANES GO INTO THE TOWERS. AND

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:31.997
THEN THE NEXT THING I REMEMBER

00:20:32.064 --> 00:20:33.532
IS HEARING ABOUT A PLANE THAT

00:20:33.599 --> 00:20:37.369
WENT INTO THE PENTAGON. AND THE

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:38.870
FOLKS THAT WORKED FOR ME WERE

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:40.072
IN THE PENTAGON THAT THAT DAY.

00:20:40.138 --> 00:20:46.144
NOW. FORTUNATELY FOR THEM THE

00:20:46.211 --> 00:20:47.879
PENTAGON WITH ABOUT FIFTY

00:20:47.946 --> 00:20:49.047
THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:51.450
IS BIG IS OF CITY OF NORCO IN

00:20:51.516 --> 00:20:54.386
MY SENATE DISTRICT. WHAT THEY

00:20:54.453 --> 00:20:56.188
FELT WAS THE BUILDING MOVE

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:57.255
WHICH IMAGINE THE PENTAGON

00:20:57.322 --> 00:20:59.891
MOVING. THE ALARMS GOING OFF

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:02.494
THE SMELL OF SMOKE AND THEN

00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:03.028
SOME SMOKE THAT EVENTUALLY

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.797
MOVED THROUGH THE CORNERS. AND

00:21:05.864 --> 00:21:07.633
PEOPLE TELLING THEM TO EVACUATE

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:11.937
AND LEADING THEM. LEADING THEM

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:15.040
FROM THEIR OFFICES DOWN TO THE

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:15.607
COURTYARD AND OUTSIDE OF THE

00:21:15.674 --> 00:21:18.710
PENTAGON. SO THEY WERE VERY

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:21.079
VERY FORTUNATE TEN AND THEY

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:22.147
SPOKE TO ME ABOUT THEIR

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:25.384
EXPERIENCE AND EVEN THOUGH THEY

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.954
WERE NOT INJURED IN ANY WAY.

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.323
THEY SPEND DAYS OUTSIDE OF THE

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.957
PENTAGON THEIR CARS LEFT IN THE

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:35.427
PARKING LOT. THEY WERE

00:21:35.494 --> 00:21:36.862
TRAUMATIZED BY THAT PARTICULAR

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:39.831

MASTER SERGEANT AND SOME OTHERS.

00:21:43.268 --> 00:21:44.770
BUT THEY WERE VERY VERY LUCKY

00:21:44.836 --> 00:21:45.303
BECAUSE OTHERS WERE NOT SO

00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.374
FORTUNATE. MY IMMEDIATE

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:51.109

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:52.744
AT THE TIME HE WAS OVER ON A

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:54.880
NAVY MISSION BECAUSE HIS

00:21:54.946 --> 00:21:58.684

CORPS AND HIS OFFICE

00:22:09.494 --> 00:22:12.230
UNFORTUNATELY WAS RIGHT ABOVE

WHERE THE PLANE WENT INTO THE

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:17.402

TALKING TO THIS GENTLEMAN A

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:24.042
CIVILIAN LAWYER WHO WAS THE

THAT WERE CAUSED BY THE PLANE

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:40.859
BUT HE COULD NOT GET OUT OF HIS

00:22:40.926 --> 00:22:42.227
OFFICE BECAUSE THE IMPACTED

00:22:42.294 --> 00:22:44.129
JAMMED THE OFFICE DOOR AND HE

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:46.398
WAS TRAPPED. FORTUNATELY FOR

HIM. HE WAS ASSIGNED BECAUSE OF

00:22:50.836 --> 00:22:54.005

00:22:54.072 --> 00:22:58.276
BURLY OF MARINE CORPS NCOS WHO

DOOR OFF THE HINGES TO GET HIM

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:07.385

PARKING LOT. OF THE PENTAGON.

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:27.906
SO THERE WAS NOT ONE SINGLE

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:29.808
PERSON ON THIS DAY THE

00:23:29.875 --> 00:23:30.809

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:33.716
CONCERNS ABOUT IT AND THE

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.385
CONCERNS REMAIN AND THAT IS

00:57:35.451 --> 00:57:37.053
THAT IN THE IN A VERY LARGE

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.421
PART OF MY DISTRICT THERE ARE A

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:39.989
NUMBER OF COUNTY IN

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:41.925
INCORPORATED AREAS THAT WERE

00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:44.294
NON NOT ANNEXED INTO THE CITY

00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.395
AND SO IT LEFT THEM AS DONUT

00:57:45.461 --> 00:57:47.163
HOLES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:47.764
IF YOU'RE DRIVING THROUGH THE

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:50.667
COMMUNITY AT NIGHT YOU WILL SEE

00:57:50.733 --> 00:57:52.302
STREET LIGHT CURBS AND GUTTERS

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.803
AND THEN YOU COME TO THE END OF

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:54.804
THE STREET AND THE REST OF THE

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.874
STREET IS DARK IT HAS NONE IT

00:57:57.941 --> 00:57:59.776

TANKS AND IT HAS ITS IN THEIR

00:58:04.781 --> 00:58:06.516
OWN SEPARATE WELLS. AND THE

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:08.685
CHALLENGE WITH THIS PARTICULAR

00:58:08.751 --> 00:58:10.320
BILL IS I JUST DON'T THINK IT

00:58:10.386 --> 00:58:11.254
GOES FAR ENOUGH THIS IS THE

00:58:11.321 --> 00:58:13.189
COMMUNITIES ENDED UP JUMPING

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:14.290
OVER THESE DISADVANTAGED

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:15.992
COMMUNITIES THEY'RE VERY POOR

00:58:16.059 --> 00:58:17.460
THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY FOR

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:18.761
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:19.829
IT'S GOING TO BE INCUMBENT UPON

00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:21.197
THE STATE TO FORCE THESE

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:23.499
ANNEXATIONS AND TO REQUIRE THEM

00:58:23.566 --> 00:58:25.168
THE COUNTY AND THE CITY ALONG

00:58:25.235 --> 00:58:26.736
WITH THE STATE TO PUT UP SOME

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:28.471
MONEY. TO START FIXING THE

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:29.706
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE WE'RE

00:58:29.772 --> 00:58:31.307
NEVER GOING TO GET THEM

00:58:31.374 --> 00:58:33.543
INCLUDED AND FRANKLY THERE

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:35.044
ABANDONED THIS BILL DOES NOT

00:58:35.111 --> 00:58:37.714
DOES NOT HELP THEM BECAUSE THE

00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.215
PROPERTY ALL AROUND THEM HAS

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:41.084
BEEN ANNEXED ALREADY AND SO I

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:42.585
DON'T THINK THE BILL GOES FAR

00:58:42.652 --> 00:58:43.987
ENOUGH BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:46.089
BECAUSE IN THE EVENT THAT THAT

00:58:46.155 --> 00:58:47.290
THERE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:48.358
BE ANNEXED IF THERE'S OTHER.

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:50.760
PROPERTY NEARBY WE SHOULD DO IT

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:51.895
BUT I THINK THE STATE'S GOING

00:58:51.961 --> 00:58:52.695
TO HAVE TO LEAD THE WAY AND BE

00:58:52.762 --> 00:58:54.230
THE LEADER IN THIS AND SAY WHAT

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:56.699
WILL PUT UP SOME MONEY FOR IT

00:58:56.766 --> 00:59:02.272
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO.

00:59:02.338 --> 00:59:02.805
DO GREAT THANK YOU CENTER.

THIS FROM THE POSITION LOCAL

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:14.918
CONTROL I THINK WHEN WE START

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:16.886
DICTATING IN THERE ARE ALREADY

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.821
LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT CERTAIN

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:21.090
ON COUNTY ISLANDS FOR EXAMPLE

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:22.091
IF THEY'RE UNDER CERTAIN NUMBER

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.960
PARCELS OR A CERTAIN SIZE I

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:24.861
SHOULD BE NATURALLY ABSORBED BY

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:26.629
THE LARGER ENTITY NEARBY BUT

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:28.164
THE PURPOSE OF LASKO IS TO

TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE IN

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:43.446
POSITIONS LIKE THIS I THINK IT

00:59:43.513 --> 00:59:44.614
FLIES IN THE FACE OF LOCAL

PARTICULAR ISSUE THAT MY

01:16:57.145 --> 01:16:58.814
COLLEAGUES REYES I THINK WE

AFTER THAT TWO YEARS COMPLETED

THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND I DON'T

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:33.515

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.242
PUBLIC BLANCA SIMPLY

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.345
ESTABLISHES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL

01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.679
GOVERNMENT TO CHARTER A PUBLIC

PROCESS. WITH MANY REGULATORY

01:23:10.218 --> 01:23:13.254
HURDLES HOWEVER IT IT ALLOWS

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.090
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THIS

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:17.225
THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA IT'S

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:20.662
BEEN DONE IN NORTH DAKOTA IT'S

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:21.229
BEEN DONE FOR OVER A HUNDRED

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:24.265
YEARS SUCCESSFULLY. AND THIS

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:25.433
COULD WORK FOR OUR LOCAL CITIES

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:28.837
LET THEM DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO

01:23:28.903 --> 01:23:30.205
WORK ON THIS I THINK THIS IS A

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.941

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:41.649
ATTACKS SOLIS WORKING FOR THE

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:42.183
BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY THAN

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.087

I KNOW SOME BANKS HAVE STEPPED

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.501
UP BUT OTHERS HAVEN'T OTHERS

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:02.170
HAVE FLED. UNDERSERVED AREAS IN

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:02.804
THIS WILL ALLOW LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS TO LEASE PROVIDE

01:24:04.139 --> 01:24:05.874

TRIED TO THE BUSINESS PLAN WENT

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:26.180
THROUGH THE MECHANICS REALIZE I

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.515
WAS GOING TO SAVE A MILLION

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.150
DOLLARS IF I STARTED A BANK FOR

01:26:29.217 --> 01:26:32.620
THE COUNTY TO HANDLE THIS.

01:26:32.687 --> 01:26:36.357

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:38.893
PASSED THE CEOS OF ALL THE

SMALL BANKS IN ORANGE COUNTY

01:26:39.794 --> 01:26:40.962
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.031

ONLY DO WE LIKE THE IDEA WOULD

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:48.937
LIKE TO BE ON YOUR BOARD. SO

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:49.504

01:27:07.855 --> 01:27:09.424
FIRST OF THE MONTH THE SHOPPERS

01:27:09.490 --> 01:27:11.593
OF THAT STORE COULD NOT GET

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:12.160
INTO THE STORE BECAUSE THERE

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:15.029

01:27:15.096 --> 01:27:15.730

DOLLARS A MONTH.JUST FOR THAT

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:24.205
ONE DAY THE CASH CHECKS FOR THE

BUDGET ANALYST YOU'RE GOING TO

01:27:36.284 --> 01:27:37.018
BE RESPONSIBLEFOR. HE WAS

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:41.055
PRETTY UPSET. BUT HE CAME BACK

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:41.689
ABOUT A WEEK LATER AND SAID YOU

WILL REIMBURSE ME 80% OF MY

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:56.738
COST AND I THOUGHT MY GOODNESS.

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:58.239
OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTY WAS LITTLE

01:27:58.306 --> 01:27:59.440
FLOPPY AND DIDN'T CHECK INTO

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:01.676
THIS BEFORE BUT IF I'M GOING TO

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.377

DO THAT. BUT IT WAS A FUN

01:28:11.919 --> 01:28:12.987
EXERCISE AND I WAS VERY

01:28:13.054 --> 01:28:15.490
APPRECIATIVE OF EVERYONE ALONG

01:28:15.556 --> 01:28:16.057
THE WAY BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.227
FROM THAT EXERCISE. THAT THE

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.629
PROFIT MARGIN IS THE MINIMUS I

01:28:21.696 --> 01:28:22.530
MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO YOU'RE

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:23.698
GOING TO FIND IT IF YOU START A

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:26.000
BANK IS A MUNICIPALITY THAT YOU

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:28.403
HAVE. MORE DOWNSIDE THEN YOU

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:31.139
HAVE UP SIDE. AND YOUR DRIFTING

01:28:31.205 --> 01:28:31.939
FROM WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:34.142
BE. WE DON'T DESIGN GOVERNMENTS

01:28:34.208 --> 01:28:36.678
TO RUN BANKS. AND SO GIVING

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:39.480
PERMISSION FOR THIS ONLY

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:42.617
EXPOSES THOSE THAT HAVE GONE OR

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:44.152
WISH TO GO INTO THIS AREA TO

01:28:44.218 --> 01:28:46.821
MORE DOWNSIDE AND RIGHT NOW

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:47.722
LOOKING AT THEIR FINANCIAL

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:49.057
SATEMENTS THE OUR CITIES AND

01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:50.658
OUR MUNICIPALITIES DO NOT NEED

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:52.727
MORE. DOWNSIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:28:52.794 --> 01:28:54.929
READY FISCALLY DISTRESSED WITH

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:57.231
EVER INCREASING PENSION COSTS

01:28:57.298 --> 01:28:59.600
AND THE REST SO I'M I'M UST

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:00.968
TELLING YOU AS SOMEONE WHO HAS

01:29:01.035 --> 01:29:02.704
GONE DOWN THIS ROAD. THAT IT

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:05.139
ISN'T A PRUDENT WAY TO GO IT

01:29:05.206 --> 01:29:08.376
WON'T BE BENEFICIAL. AND WE

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:11.546
DON'T HAVE A DIRT THE BANKS

01:29:11.612 --> 01:29:15.383
LEAVING COMMUNITIES WE HAVE. SO

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.219
MANY CHASIN. BANK OUTLETS IN

01:29:18.286 --> 01:29:19.687
SHOPPING CENTERS AND BUILDINGS

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.122
POPPING UP EVERY WE DO NOT HAVE

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:22.623
A BANK SHORTAGE SO WITH THAT I

01:29:22.690 --> 01:29:23.658
ALSO WOULD SAY THAT NORTH

01:29:23.725 --> 01:29:25.660
DAKOTA IS NOT A GOOD EXAMPLE

01:29:25.727 --> 01:29:27.195
IT'S LIKE COMPARING APPLES

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:28.763
VERSUS ORANGES SO COLLEAGUES I

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:31.733
RESPECTFULLY URGE A NO VOTE ON

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:36.104
A. B. EIGHT. FIFTY SEVEN. THANK

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:40.575
YOU SIR MORE LOCK CENTER BELL.

01:29:40.641 --> 01:29:42.577
JUST BASICALLY. I THINK THE OF

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.378
THE CLAUSE IN THE BILL THAT

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:48.282
REQUIRES A ANALYSIS. AND THAT

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:48.816
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IS

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.819
EXACTLY THE KIND OF. THINGS

01:29:51.886 --> 01:29:53.821
THAT WILL HAPPEN IF ANYBODY

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.022
EVER WANTS TO CONSIDER A PUBLIC

01:29:55.089 --> 01:29:57.091
BANK SO THERE IS A SECTION IN

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:57.925
THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH THAT

01:29:57.992 --> 01:30:00.661
ISSUE CORD REQUIRES THAT KIND

01:30:00.728 --> 01:30:03.064
OF STUDY. IT'S PRUDENT TO DO

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.932
THAT KIND OF STUDY AND A LOT OF

01:30:04.999 --> 01:30:07.268
A LOT OF STUDY BEFORE THESE

01:30:07.335 --> 01:30:09.470
KINDS OF THINGS OR ESTABLISH

01:30:09.537 --> 01:30:11.839
HOWEVER I THINK THERE IS A NEED

01:30:11.906 --> 01:30:14.308
TO HAVE IS MANY TOOLS IN THE

01:30:14.375 --> 01:30:17.378
TOOLBOX. OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:21.783
AND FINANCING AGENCIES THAT

01:30:21.849 --> 01:30:23.885
FINANCE INFRASTRUCTURE HOUSING

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:27.421
OTHER KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AND

HAVING SUCH A- THE OPPORTUNITY

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:34.362
TO CREATE WHETHER IT'S LIMóN

01:30:34.428 --> 01:30:38.366
EARNED OR OR QUITE. OPEN COULD

01:30:38.432 --> 01:30:40.568
BE AN A TOOL THAT WOULD BE IS

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:43.070
OF BENEFIT TO OUR COMMUNITY SO

01:30:43.137 --> 01:30:46.174
HARD SUPPORT FOR THIS. IT

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.008
DOESN'T SAY PUBLIC BANKS CREDIT

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:50.311
SENSORS A PROCESS TO GO THROUGH

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:55.883
TO CREATE A PUMP. THAT'S WHAT

01:30:55.950 --> 01:31:01.556
THE BILL DOES ARJAN AYE VOTE.

PUBLIC BANKING OR FINANCIAL

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:23.611
HELP COULD BE A BENEFIT AND

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:24.412
THAT'S HOUSING THAT'S

01:31:24.478 --> 01:31:25.880

PROHIBITION BY THE FEDERAL

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.322
GOVERNMENT ALLOWING BANKING IN

01:31:34.388 --> 01:31:35.890
CANNABIS IS CREATING ENORMOUS

01:31:35.957 --> 01:31:38.426
PROBLEMS THE TO THE STATE

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:40.795

TREASURER JUDGE JOHN. TRAVEL

01:31:43.264 --> 01:31:44.498
AROUND THE STATE TO FIGURE OUT

01:31:44.565 --> 01:31:45.066
HOW THEY COULD TO DEAL WITH

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:47.068
THAT ISSUE NAY IT DIDN'T SETTLE

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:49.937
ON THIS IS AS A VIABLE SOLUTION

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.305
BUT IT IT HAS A LOT IT HAS A

01:31:51.372 --> 01:31:54.342
LOT OF APPEAL THE LA TIMES THAT

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:54.942
HAD A VERY GOOD EDITORIAL ON

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.277

IS THE COURAGE TO KNOW VOTE ON

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.386
THE ISSUE BUT THEY RAISE A VERY

01:32:05.453 --> 01:32:06.988
GOOD ISSUES ABOUT THE ABILITY

01:32:07.054 --> 01:32:09.857
OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE CHOICES

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.792
THAT COULD HAVE THE TINGE OF

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:12.927
POLITICS INVOLVED IN THOSE

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.695
CHOICES AND WHETHER OR NOT

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:16.330
THAT'S THE RIGHT FIDUCIARY

01:32:16.397 --> 01:32:22.570
RESPONSIBILITY. FOR A PUBLIC

01:32:22.637 --> 01:32:31.078

ONLY AUTHORIZES. A PROCESS

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:39.687

01:34:01.702 --> 01:34:02.870
WANT TO AGREE WITH A LOT OF HIS

01:34:02.937 --> 01:34:03.971
COMMENTS AND ONCE A ONE AGREE

01:34:04.038 --> 01:34:06.173
WITH WAS. THE YOU CAN'T COMPARE

01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:11.178
THE. NOTE THE QUARTERBACK TO

01:34:11.245 --> 01:34:13.014
OTHER BANKS WHEN THE LEADERS OF

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:13.781
NORTH DAKOTA WE'RE ASKING YOU

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:14.248
KNOW IT'S A REPUBLICAN

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:16.584
STATEMENTS RUN BY A REPUBLICAN

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.551
GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE WHEN

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:19.353
THEY WERE ASKED DO YOU SUPPORT

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:21.222
PUBLIC BANKING THEIR RESPONSES.

01:34:21.288 --> 01:34:23.958
WE LOVE OUR PUBLIC BANK BUT WE

01:34:24.025 --> 01:34:25.860
DON'T RECOMMEND ANYBODY ELSE TO

01:34:25.926 --> 01:34:27.361
IT. AND THAT'S THAT'S A

01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:30.097
CONTRADICTION IN AND

01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:34.835
UNFORTUNATELY IT IT'S BECOME OF.

01:34:34.902 --> 01:34:38.239
A NEW ISSUE. THAT IT SEEMS TO

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.440
BE SOMEWHAT PARTISAN WHEN IT

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:40.975
REALLY ISN'T. THE NORTH DAKOTA

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.209
BANK WAS ACTUALLY STARTED BY

01:34:42.276 --> 01:34:45.012
FARMERS. TO GET GET THEM ACCESS

01:34:45.079 --> 01:34:47.415
TO CAPITAL. WHERE THE REGULAR

01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:49.283
BANKING COMMUNITY DIDN'T HAVE

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.451
ACCESS TO THAT WE HAVE

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:52.620
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA DON'T

01:34:52.686 --> 01:34:54.822
HAVE ACCESS. TO BANKING WAR OR

01:34:54.889 --> 01:34:59.727
FINANCING. SO IT WORKS IN

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:02.296
ACTUALLY IN NORTH DAKOTA. THEY

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.598
THEY HAVE HELPED MAKE BANKING

01:35:04.665 --> 01:35:06.033
MORE COMPETITIVE IN THEIR STATE

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.368
SO THEY HAVE MORE BANKING

01:35:07.435 --> 01:35:09.203
COVERAGE THAN ANY OTHER STATE

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:10.971
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR PUBLIC

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.339
BANK BECAUSE OF THE BACK AND

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:14.408
ACTUALLY BRINGS A LOT OF

01:35:14.475 --> 01:35:17.545
CAPITAL A LOT OF REVENUE TO

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:19.880
THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT. SO YES

01:35:19.947 --> 01:35:22.083
IT IS NOT A FAIR COMPARISON

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:23.117
BECAUSE THE PUBLIC BACK IN

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.319
NORTH DAKOTA IS HELPING PUT

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:27.922
MONEY FOR PUBLIC SERVICES IN

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:28.756
NORTH DAKOTA TOPPING TO ENHANCE

01:35:28.823 --> 01:35:31.859
BANKING IN COMMUNITIES SO IT'S

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:33.928
BEEN A GREAT PRODUCT FOR NORTH

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:36.030
DAKOTA AND I DON'T SEE WHY IT

01:35:36.097 --> 01:35:39.700
WON'T WORK FOR CALIFORNIA SO. I

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:40.301
WANT TO ADD THAT AND THE OTHER

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:44.605
THING IS. YOU KNOW IF

01:35:44.672 --> 01:35:45.339
GOVERNMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:47.208
MISSION. WHERE WHERE WAS A

JUST A MATTER OF LET THE LOCAL

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:32.786
GOVERNMENTS DECIDE WHETHER THIS

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:34.855
WORKS FOR THEM IT MIGHT WE THIS

CAMERAS LET'S BE CLEAR IT IS

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.933
IMPORTANT THAT WE REINFORCE

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:14.902
THAT THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO

ARE MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR THIS

01:41:20.974 --> 01:41:23.277

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.227
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

01:41:40.294 --> 01:41:45.132
THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD. ANY

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:45.699
FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION

01:41:45.766 --> 01:41:49.570
SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU

01:41:49.636 --> 01:41:52.172
MISTER PRESIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.640
HIGH RISE TO OPPOSE THE BILL

01:41:53.707 --> 01:41:54.341
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:54.942
TECHNOLOGY IS SOMETHING THAT

01:41:55.008 --> 01:41:57.244
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON AND I

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:58.679
APPRECIATE WITH THE AUTHOR

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.214
TRYING TO DO WITH THE MEASURE

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:01.748
BUT I AM OPPOSED TO NOT RIDE

01:42:01.815 --> 01:42:03.784
BAN ON THE NEW TECHNOLOGY I

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.686
THINK THE TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:07.754
RESEARCH SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:10.557
TO STANDARDS AND IT WILL BE

01:42:10.624 --> 01:42:13.026
FAIR AND EQUITABLE IF SOMEONE

01:42:13.093 --> 01:42:14.428
CAN LOOK IN THE CAMERA AND

01:42:14.495 --> 01:42:15.963
THERE IS NO DEVIATION FROM THE

01:42:16.029 --> 01:42:18.599
SCREEN. SO I BELIEVE THAT WE

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:19.333
HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON THE

01:42:19.399 --> 01:42:20.667
TECHNOLOGY IT SAID ABOUT

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.970
BLOWING THE FACIAL RECOGNITION

01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:25.205
SOFTWARE I THINK THE STATE

01:42:25.272 --> 01:42:26.406
SHOULD BE GETTING OUR CITY

01:42:26.473 --> 01:42:27.407
PARAMETERS AROUND THE USE OF

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:28.942
THE TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK

01:42:29.009 --> 01:42:30.811
THAT'S THE ISSUE IS THE USE OF

01:42:30.878 --> 01:42:33.046
THE TECHNOLOGY WHICH WE ALL

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:34.448
KNOW IT'S UNFAIR NOT EQUITABLE

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:37.718
AS WILL AS I TOO AM A VICTIM OF

01:42:37.784 --> 01:42:39.219
THE CAMERA. BUT THIS DOESN'T DO

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:41.655
THAT CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADER

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:43.490
OF A TECHNICAL SECTOR AND AS

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:44.758
THE LEADER WE SHOULD BE

01:42:44.825 --> 01:42:45.792
IMPLEMENTING THE BEST PRACTICES

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.895
OF TECHNOLOGY HERE IN

01:42:47.961 --> 01:42:48.996
CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN OTHER

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.864
STATES SO FOR THIS REASON I

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:52.266
THINK THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL

01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:53.667
AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IS

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:55.569
FLAWED AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:59.273
IMPROVE IT ON THE NEXT ONE. IS

01:42:59.339 --> 01:43:03.343
OVER THIS I URGE A NO VOTE.

01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:05.479
THANK YOU SIR CENTER HERTZBERG.

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:08.115
BRIEFLY MISTER PRESIDENT I

01:43:08.181 --> 01:43:11.084
AGREE WITH. THE SENATOR FROM

01:43:11.151 --> 01:43:12.119
PICO RIVERA THAT THERE'S A

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:14.488
CHALLENGE HERE BUT WHAT THIS

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:20.093
LEGISLATION DOES. IS VAN THE

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.195
FACIAL RECOGNITION SYSTEM FOR

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:23.530
THREE YEARS NOW I KNOW IN

01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:24.798
TECHNOLOGY THREE YEARS IS A

01:43:24.865 --> 01:43:26.900
LIFETIME BUT ORIGINALLY WRITTEN

01:43:26.967 --> 01:43:28.869
I THINK IT WAS TEN YEARS OR

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.304
SEVEN YEARS OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.839
THAT THE BALANCE OF CIVIL

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.474
LIBERTIES THE BALANCE OF THE

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:37.244
NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:39.379
THE LIKE AGAINST WHAT IS PROVEN

01:43:39.446 --> 01:43:42.349
TO BE SECTION EIGHT EIGHT

01:43:42.416 --> 01:43:45.419
ABSOLUTELY L

01:43:45.485 --> 01:43:47.454
SOURCE OF INFORMATION THE

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:49.856
IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL LIVES THE

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.925
AVAILABILITY OF THE

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:54.528
EXTRAORDINARY RESOURCES. A FOR

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.330
LAW ENFORCEMENT TODAY THAT HAVE

01:43:56.396 --> 01:43:59.166
NEVER EXISTED BEFORE THE

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:04.104
QUESTION IS. GIVEN THAT BALANCE

01:44:04.171 --> 01:44:05.939
IS IT THE RIGHT THING TO DO TO

01:44:06.006 --> 01:44:08.108
GET THE TECHNOLOGY CORRECT

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:10.143
WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS IN BIAS

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.645
IN OTHER AREAS AND THINGS LIKE

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:13.547
THAT WHERE THERE'S THIS GROWTH

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.816
OF TECHNOLOGY THAT BOTH HAS

01:44:15.882 --> 01:44:17.784
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES TO

01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.886
HELP GOVERNMENT IN MANY WAYS.

01:44:19.953 --> 01:44:23.690
BUT YET ISN'T QUITE THERE YET

01:44:23.757 --> 01:44:24.691
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT OUR THREE

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.293
YEAR AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.762
BY THE AUTHOR ARE VERY GENEROUS

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.263
AND A THREE YEAR DELAY IS THE

01:44:30.330 --> 01:44:32.633
RIGHT THING TO DO BALANCE IS

01:44:32.699 --> 01:44:34.968
THE NECESSARY NEEDS AGAINST

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:37.838
NECESSARY RISK IT AS SUCH I'LL

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:38.405
BE VOTING FOR THIS MEASURE.

01:44:38.472 --> 01:44:42.976
THANK YOU SIR. ANY ADDITIONAL

01:44:43.043 --> 01:44:43.510
DEBATER DISCUSSION CENTER

01:44:43.577 --> 01:44:47.447
SKINNER. THANK YOU I JUST WANT

01:44:47.514 --> 01:44:50.784
TO REINFORCE THE COMMENTS BY MY.

01:44:50.851 --> 01:44:52.919
CALLING FROM THE VALLEY AND-

01:44:52.986 --> 01:44:59.493
THE- I THINK THE DANGER OF. OF

01:44:59.559 --> 01:45:00.027
ARE NOT TAKING THE ACTION

01:45:00.093 --> 01:45:04.498
THAT'S BEFORE US. IS THAT A

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:09.236
TECHNOLOGY THAT IS STILL FLAWED.

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:12.572
COULD THEN BE USED IN A WAY

01:45:12.639 --> 01:45:13.173
THAT COULD BE VERY HARMFUL AND

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.542
I THINK NONE OF US WANT THAT.

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:20.580
WE DO WANT OUR. LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:21.381
TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR JOBS

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.984
ABSOLUTELY AND WE ALSO WANT TO

01:45:24.051 --> 01:45:28.655
BE ABLE TO. PURSUE THE FOLKS

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.724
THAT WE FEEL ARE THE POTENTIAL

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:34.795
PERPETRATORS OF A CRIME. AND

01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:37.364
HAVE THE SECURITY THAT OUR LAW

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:40.767
ENFORCEMENT CAN APPREHEND THEM.

01:45:40.834 --> 01:45:41.301
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IN ITS

01:45:41.368 --> 01:45:46.540
CURRENT FORM. IS AS WAS EIGHTY

01:45:46.606 --> 01:45:49.376
EIGHT EVERY BIT OF DATA THAT

01:45:49.443 --> 01:45:52.813
YET TESTED IT SHOWS. IS IN A

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:55.415
LOT OF MISTAKES IN VERY VERY

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.551
SADLY THOSE MISTAKES I DON'T

01:45:57.617 --> 01:45:59.219
WANT TO SEE SADLY BUT I SUPPOSE

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:01.988
TYPICALLY THOSE MISTAKES ARE

01:46:02.055 --> 01:46:10.097
MOSTLY. IT ACCURATELY CAPTURING

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:10.797
THE FACES OF BLACK AND BROWN

01:46:10.864 --> 01:46:13.834
PEOPLE KNOW MY FACE SO WHEN THE

01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:16.403
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE THAT SHOWED

01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:18.371
WHICH OF THE LEGISLATORS IT

01:46:18.438 --> 01:46:22.576
INACCURATELY DEPICTED AS A

01:46:22.642 --> 01:46:23.210
POTENTIAL CRIMINAL. I WAS IN ON

01:46:23.276 --> 01:46:28.048
IT. BUT THE AUTHOR. ASSEMBLY

01:46:28.115 --> 01:46:30.183
MEMBER TEAM WAS LISTED. I DON'T

01:46:30.250 --> 01:46:31.218
THINK THERE WAS ONE WHITE

01:46:31.284 --> 01:46:35.455
LEGISLATOR ON THE LIST THAT THE

01:46:35.522 --> 01:46:36.323
TEST SHOWED. THERE MIGHT HAVE

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:38.825
BEEN OKAY SORRY ALL RIGHT I

01:46:38.892 --> 01:46:39.426
GUESS WE HAVE A FEW CRIMINALS

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:46.800
SORRY SORRY. ALL RIGHT WELL.

01:46:46.867 --> 01:46:48.368
BUT THE POINT BEING THE POINT

01:46:48.435 --> 01:46:51.505
BEING THEY TESTED. ALL OF OUR

01:46:51.571 --> 01:46:54.808
FACES SO. IT IS AS MY COLLEAGUE

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.476
FROM THE VALLEY POINTED OUT.

01:46:56.543 --> 01:46:59.846
IT'S ONLY THREE YEARS. AND

01:46:59.913 --> 01:47:01.114
TECHNOLOGY CAN GREATLY IMPROVE.

01:47:01.181 --> 01:47:01.681
SO I THINK THAT THIS IS THE

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:07.654
RIGHT. ACTION TO TAKE TODAY.

01:47:07.721 --> 01:47:08.755
THANK YOU SIR SKINNER SENATOR

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:09.623
JONES THANK YOU MISTER

01:47:09.689 --> 01:47:11.725
PRESIDENT AS ONE OF THOSE

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:13.760
LEGISLATORS THAT DID SHOW UP ON

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:16.329
THE LIST I DO RISE IN SUPPORT

01:47:16.396 --> 01:47:19.166
OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN ALSO

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:21.635
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS SOME

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.937
DEBATE AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF

01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:25.572
US DISCUSS THE DEBATE REGARDING

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.741
THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY ON

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:30.243
THE 80% VERSUS THE 99% IF THEY

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:32.946
HAD YOU KNOW. CHANGE ALGORITHM

01:47:33.013 --> 01:47:33.914
OR WHATEVER BUT YOU KNOW WHAT

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.415
BEAT REGARDLESS OF ALL OF THAT

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:38.218
I'M NOT SURE I'M COMFORTABLE

01:47:38.285 --> 01:47:40.086
WITH THIS TECHNOLOGY BEING USED

01:47:40.153 --> 01:47:43.056
MAYBE EVER SO I KNOW THAT THE

01:47:43.123 --> 01:47:45.592
ADVOCATES OF THE BILL HAVE

01:47:45.659 --> 01:47:47.227
WORKED VERY DILIGENTLY THIS

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.029
YEAR TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:50.397
THAT MAKES SENSE I KNOW THE

01:47:50.463 --> 01:47:51.598
AUTHOR AND THE FLOOR JOCKEY

01:47:51.665 --> 01:47:52.632
HAVE WORKED VERY DILIGENT

01:47:52.699 --> 01:47:55.068
DILIGENTLY ON IT AS WELL I

01:47:55.135 --> 01:47:58.104
THINK THE THREE YEAR SUNSET IS

01:47:58.171 --> 01:47:59.706
MORE THAN REASONABLE AND JUST

01:47:59.773 --> 01:48:01.374
TO PUT THAT INTO PERSPECTIVE.

01:48:01.441 --> 01:48:06.613
COLLEAGUES WERE ON THE LAST.

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:12.719
THREE DAYS. OF OUR FIRST YEAR.

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:13.453
AND THIS LEGISLATURE. TIME

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:15.121
FLIES. SO THREE YEARS IS GONNA

01:48:15.188 --> 01:48:16.857
GO BY REALLY FAST AND I HAD

01:48:16.923 --> 01:48:17.457
ASKED THAT WE ALL SUPPORT THIS

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:20.694
BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR

01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:23.864
CENTER GALGIANI. I RISE IS ONE

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:24.431
OF THE LEGISLATORS WITH THE

01:48:24.497 --> 01:48:25.599
TWIN OUT THERE I HAVE TWO

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:26.700
POINTS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:27.834
ONE IS THAT WHEN I WAS IN THE

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.569
ASSEMBLY I WAS ASKED TO VOTE ON

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:31.438
A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR

01:48:31.504 --> 01:48:33.773
SELF DRIVING VEHICLES WE HAD

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.275
NEVER HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:37.878
ABOUT THAT SUBJECT MATTER IT

01:48:37.944 --> 01:48:39.446
WAS THE FURTHEST THING FROM MY

01:48:39.512 --> 01:48:41.481
MIND AND I REALLY DIDN'T FEEL

01:48:41.548 --> 01:48:42.849
THAT I KNEW ENOUGH ABOUT THE

01:48:42.916 --> 01:48:45.252
TECHNOLOGY TO CAST A VOTE. BUT

01:48:45.318 --> 01:48:48.221
WE ALL DID CAST VOTES. I DON'T

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:50.257
BELIEVE ANYBODY REALIZE HOW

01:48:50.323 --> 01:48:52.058
QUICKLY THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.327
ADAPT AND HOW SOON. THERE WOULD

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:57.430
BE ELECTRIC SELF DRIVING CARS

01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:58.798
OUT THERE BEING TESTED ON THE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.233
ROAD WE COULDN'T WE COULDN'T

01:49:00.300 --> 01:49:02.135
PREDICT WHAT THE ADVANCEMENTS

01:49:02.202 --> 01:49:04.971
IN THAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE.

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:07.574
SECONDLY I REPRESENT STANISLAUS

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:10.610
COUNTY AND EARLIER. THIS MONTH

01:49:10.677 --> 01:49:12.779
WE HAD A STRAIGHT PRIDE PARADE

01:49:12.846 --> 01:49:15.749
AND MODESTO. AND WHILE WE WERE

01:49:15.815 --> 01:49:16.917
VERY FORTUNATE THERE WERE THAT

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:20.086
THERE WERE NO NOT ANY VIOLENT.

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:23.056
ISSUES ARE INCIDENTS. I WOULD

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:25.725
WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:27.093
TO GO TO A PUBLIC EVENT LIKE

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.829
THAT WHERE. INDIVIDUALS WERE

01:49:29.896 --> 01:49:31.464
UNDER THREAT AND TO BE ABLE TO

01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:33.967
RECOGNIZE WHO THEY SHOULD WATCH

01:49:34.034 --> 01:49:36.836
MORE CAREFULLY AND CAUTIOUSLY.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:41.474
TO AVOID AN ASSAULT SO I

01:49:41.541 --> 01:49:42.042
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO

01:49:42.108 --> 01:49:46.846
VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:50.550
MITCHELL. I STAND UP IN SUPPORT

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:51.651
OF THE BILL FOR ONCE

01:49:51.718 --> 01:49:52.652
ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT I

01:49:52.719 --> 01:49:53.820
DIDN'T SHOW UP ON A LIST FOR

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:55.121
ONCE WHEN IT COMES TO LAW

01:49:55.188 --> 01:50:00.327
ENFORCEMENT SO. GOAL HOLLY I. I

01:50:00.393 --> 01:50:02.128
THINK A THREE YEAR PAUSE. IS

01:50:02.195 --> 01:50:03.863
APPROPRIATE WE ARE DEALING WITH

01:50:03.930 --> 01:50:06.499
LOTS OF CONCERNS AROUND BIAS

01:50:06.566 --> 01:50:08.601
IMPLICIT EXPLICIT OTHERWISE.

01:50:08.668 --> 01:50:10.737
AND SO AS WE ARE HAVING THOSE

01:50:10.804 --> 01:50:11.805
CONVERSATIONS TALKING ABOUT

01:50:11.871 --> 01:50:15.241
TRAINING. ELEVATING THOSE

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:17.911
ISSUES WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW.

01:50:17.978 --> 01:50:20.947
POLICE STOPS ARRESTS I HAVE

01:50:21.014 --> 01:50:21.715
BEEN IN. IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES

01:50:21.781 --> 01:50:22.749
AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.084
COMPARED TO ANOTHER I THINK

01:50:24.150 --> 01:50:25.318
IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT WE HAVE A

01:50:25.385 --> 01:50:26.886
PAUSE TO ALLOW TECHNOLOGY TO

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.922
CATCH UP. AND TO ALLOW OUR OVER

01:50:28.989 --> 01:50:30.890
ALL THINKING AND ATTITUDES

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.592
ABOUT COMMUNITY INTERACTION

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:34.327
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO CATCH

01:50:34.394 --> 01:50:36.296
UP AS WELL. JUST TO MAKE SURE

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:37.797
THAT WE HAVE A SENSE OF EQUITY

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:40.100
ACROSS THE BOARD. IN TERMS OF

01:50:40.166 --> 01:50:42.502
LAW ENFORCEMENT INTERACTIONS

01:50:42.569 --> 01:50:43.970
WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC THE

01:50:44.037 --> 01:50:45.705
LOBBY SUPPORTING ON MR KING'S

01:50:45.772 --> 01:50:49.843
BAIL ON. ANTI GAY THREE YEAR

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:53.613
PAUSES MORE THAN REASONABLE.

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.584
THANK YOU SENATOR. CENTER

01:50:57.650 --> 01:51:01.955
GLAZER WELCOME. THANK YOU

01:51:02.022 --> 01:51:02.655
MISTER PRESIDENT MEMBERS LIKE

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:03.790
IF THE ISSUE BEFORE US WAS

01:51:03.857 --> 01:51:05.025
ABOUT THE USE AND ABUSE OF THIS

01:51:05.091 --> 01:51:05.992
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S A HEALTHY

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:07.327
DEBATE BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:07.927
PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:10.430
TO BE TRAMPLED ON. NOBODY WANTS

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:11.631
THAT. BUT THE ISSUE HERE IS

01:51:11.698 --> 01:51:12.699
WHETHER WE ARTIFICIALLY STATE

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.833
GOVERNMENT ARTIFICIALLY PUTS A

01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:16.603
STOP. TO THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT

01:51:16.669 --> 01:51:17.704
TECHNOLOGY. THE HELP IS

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:21.274
CATCHING THE BAD PEOPLE. SO WHY

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:22.242
WOULD WE PUT OUR HEAD IN THE

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:24.310
SAND AND SAY WE'RE GONNA STOP

01:51:24.377 --> 01:51:25.412
IT ARTIFICIALLY BECAUSE OF OUT

01:51:25.478 --> 01:51:27.680
OF WORRY. THAT THAT THAT THE

01:51:27.747 --> 01:51:28.615
TECHNOLOGY GETS THE USER

01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:30.483
REVIEWS. THAT'S WHAT THE

01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:31.184
QUESTION THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:51:31.251 --> 01:51:33.386
THAT SHOULD BE BEFORE US. WE

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:34.287
WANT PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL

01:51:34.354 --> 01:51:36.356
RIGHTS TO BE PROTECTED. WE

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:37.991
DON'T WANT TO ARREST TO BE MADE

01:51:38.058 --> 01:51:39.793
FOR THE WRONG REASONS OR

01:51:39.859 --> 01:51:41.194
PROSECUTIONS TO BE MADE FOR THE

01:51:41.261 --> 01:51:44.531
WRONG REASONS. THROUGH ABUSE OF

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:45.799
ANYTHING CIVIL RIGHTS DUE

01:51:45.865 --> 01:51:50.637
PROCESS. OR THE USE OF

01:51:50.703 --> 01:51:52.572
TECHNOLOGY AND SO BECAUSE OF

01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.207
THAT I THINK THIS BILL IS.

01:51:54.274 --> 01:51:56.309
PREMATURE AND ADDRESSES THE

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:58.078
WRONG STANDARDS THAT WE SHOULD

01:51:58.144 --> 01:52:00.647
DEBATE THE DEBATE ON THIS

01:52:00.713 --> 01:52:01.181
FLOOR. AND ACCORDINGLY I'M

01:52:01.247 --> 01:52:03.650
RECOMMENDING IN NOVA. THANK YOU

01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:07.887
SIR GLAZER CENTER DIED. I

02:49:19.249 --> 02:49:21.551
REASONS IS THAT OFTEN THERE'S

FOR YEARS BEFORE THOSE PATENTS

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:15.365

MATTER IS A PATENT SUPPLEMENTS

02:53:40.843 --> 02:53:42.645
ARE ONE WAY GENERIC COMPANIES

02:53:42.712 --> 02:53:43.346
WHO WANT TO SELL DRUGS HAVE

02:53:43.412 --> 02:53:43.946
BEEN ABLE TO BRING LOWER COST.

02:53:44.013 --> 02:53:46.048
DRUGS TO THE MARKET SOONER

02:53:46.115 --> 02:53:47.183
RATHER THAN LATER. WHILE THE

02:53:47.250 --> 02:53:49.519
AUTHOR SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR

02:53:49.585 --> 02:53:50.386
TRYING TO SOLVE A LARGE AND

02:53:50.453 --> 02:53:53.156
COMPLEX ISSUE. THIS BILL IS TOO

02:53:53.222 --> 02:53:54.924
BROADLY WRITTEN AND WILL

02:53:54.991 --> 02:53:56.659
UNFORTUNATELY DO NOTHING MORE

02:53:56.726 --> 02:53:58.728
THAN RAISE THE PRICE OF DRUGS.

02:53:58.795 --> 02:53:59.262
SOMETHING I KNOW WE'RE ALL

02:53:59.328 --> 02:54:04.767
CONCERNED ABOUT. FOR THOSE

02:54:04.834 --> 02:54:05.368
REASONS I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE

02:54:05.434 --> 02:54:06.169
ON AB TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:10.473
SENATOR. ANY OTHER DISCUSSION

02:54:10.540 --> 02:54:12.475
OR DEBATE SEEING NONE THAT

02:54:12.542 --> 02:54:13.743
HERTZBERG YOU MAY CLOSE THANK

02:54:13.810 --> 02:54:15.545
YOU I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:54:15.611 --> 02:54:17.013
MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE

02:54:17.079 --> 02:54:19.348
PHARMACOLOGIC HAS A REMOVED

02:54:19.415 --> 02:54:20.583
THEIR OPPOSITION AND THE REASON

02:54:20.650 --> 02:54:23.052
IS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK AT THIS

02:54:23.119 --> 02:54:25.321
THE FIRST QUESTION IS THERE AN

02:54:25.388 --> 02:54:26.055
AGREEMENT WORST MONEY WAS PAID

02:54:26.122 --> 02:54:28.090
OR SOMETHING OF VALUE WAS PAID.

02:54:28.157 --> 02:54:29.659
THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION OF

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.561
WELL IS IT PRO COMPETITIVE OR

02:54:31.627 --> 02:54:34.697
ANTI COMPETITIVE AND WE LOOK AT

02:54:34.764 --> 02:54:35.932
THE STANDARDS AND THEY WORK

02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:37.834
WITH THE WITH THE COMMUNITY THE

02:54:37.900 --> 02:54:39.769
WHO WAS INVOLVED WITH THIS THE

02:54:39.836 --> 02:54:41.671
BUSINESS COMMUNITY WERE WORRIED

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:43.539
THAT SOMEHOW THE STANDARD WAS

02:54:43.606 --> 02:54:45.508
TOO HIGH IN TERMS OF PROVING

02:54:45.575 --> 02:54:47.910
THAT THE AGREEMENT WAS PRO

02:54:47.977 --> 02:54:49.045
COMPETITIVE BECAUSE SOMETIMES

02:54:49.111 --> 02:54:52.081
IT COULD BE PRO COMPETITIVE AND

02:54:52.148 --> 02:54:52.682
SO THIS IS ALL WE'RE TRYING TO

02:54:52.748 --> 02:54:53.683

04:31:08.151 --> 04:31:09.686
IMPORTANT TO WEEK KNOWLEDGE

04:31:09.753 --> 04:31:10.821

ATTENTION TO WHAT WE DO THEY

04:31:39.449 --> 04:31:41.418
EXISTED BACK IN MY COLLEGE DAYS

04:31:41.485 --> 04:31:43.086
WHEN I USED TO PLAY TENNIS AND

04:31:43.153 --> 04:31:44.621
THIS WOULD BEEN TERRIBLY

04:31:44.688 --> 04:31:46.857
CONVENIENT BUT I REALLY WOULD

04:31:46.923 --> 04:31:47.758
LIKE TO POSE A QUESTION IF I

04:31:47.824 --> 04:31:49.893

TO GET INTO THE OLYMPICS YOU

04:32:04.841 --> 04:32:06.677
HAD TO BE AN AMATEUR AND THE

04:32:06.743 --> 04:32:08.145
DEFINITION OF AMATEURS THAT YOU

04:32:08.211 --> 04:32:10.447
DID NOT PROFIT FROM THE THAT

04:32:10.514 --> 04:32:12.382
THE SPORT ITSELF THAT'S CHANGED

04:32:12.449 --> 04:32:14.451
A LITTLE BIT BUT IS THAT STILL

04:32:14.518 --> 04:32:16.720
THE RULE. THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF.

04:32:16.787 --> 04:32:18.955
NO IT IS NO LONGER OLIMPIC

04:32:19.022 --> 04:32:20.157
ATHLETES HAVE THE RIGHT TO

TAKE IT INTO THE OLYMPICS TO

04:32:24.227 --> 04:32:28.365
QUALIFY. NO OKAY IS NO LONGER.

WHAT IS STILL A QUALIFICATION

04:32:29.733 --> 04:32:31.802
THOUGH HOWEVER. IF YOU'RE IN

04:32:31.868 --> 04:32:33.804
COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHICH IS NOT

04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:35.372
A DIVISION ONE OR TWO SPORTS SO

04:32:35.439 --> 04:32:36.973
THAT'S NOT UNDER IN C. TO A

04:32:37.040 --> 04:32:41.812
RULES. AND LET'S SAY. YOU YOU

04:32:41.878 --> 04:32:43.246
WERE THE STAR PLAYER YOUR

04:32:43.313 --> 04:32:45.649
COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND YOU

MONETIZE YOUR YOUTUBE VIDEOS

04:32:47.984 --> 04:32:49.853
YOU WERE YOU KNOW SO FOLLOWED

04:32:49.920 --> 04:32:51.354
IN YUMA YOU WOULD THEN BE

EXCLUDED. FROM PARTICIPATING IN

04:32:55.025 --> 04:32:57.728
A DIVISION ONE OR TWO COLLEGE

04:32:57.794 --> 04:32:59.830
SPORT ACTIVITY BECAUSE YOU HAD

04:32:59.896 --> 04:33:02.799
DONE THAT PRIOR. SO THERE IS

04:33:02.866 --> 04:33:04.701
FOR EXAMPLE A YOUNG WOMAN IN

04:33:04.768 --> 04:33:08.805
CALIFORNIA SHE'S IN. MIDDLE NOT

04:33:08.872 --> 04:33:11.074
MIDDLE SCHOOL BUT BREAKING FOR

HIGH SCHOOL SHE'S A BRILLIANT

04:33:12.876 --> 04:33:15.846
SOCCER PLAYER AND SHE IS SO

BEGIN TO TAKE ENDORSEMENTS NOW

04:33:23.954 --> 04:33:26.289
BECAUSE THEY KNEW EVEN AS AN

04:33:26.356 --> 04:33:27.858
EIGHTH GRADER IF SHE TOOK

04:33:27.924 --> 04:33:29.760

EXCLUDED FROM BEING ABLE TO BE.

04:33:32.062 --> 04:33:35.732
ON A COLLEGE TEAM. CRAZY I'M

TOWARD ON THIS BECAUSE ONE I

04:33:39.603 --> 04:33:42.372
THINK THIS IS A CONTRACT RIGHT.

04:33:42.439 --> 04:33:44.641
THAT IS AT ISSUE HERE FOR

04:33:44.708 --> 04:33:46.610
SOMEONE TO BE TOLD THAT THEY

04:33:46.676 --> 04:33:48.011
CANNOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR

04:33:48.078 --> 04:33:51.314
LIKENESS. IN THE COURSE OF

04:33:51.381 --> 04:33:53.517
THEIR THERE COLLEGE OR

04:33:53.583 --> 04:33:55.752
UNIVERSITY EXPERIENCE JUST

04:33:55.819 --> 04:33:57.320
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR WHEN EVERYONE

04:33:57.387 --> 04:33:58.622
ELSE SO IT'S ALMOST LIKE A

04:33:58.688 --> 04:34:01.191
CONTRACT RIGHT. IN THAT'S BUT

04:34:01.258 --> 04:34:03.026
MY ON THE FLIP SIDE I'M

04:34:03.093 --> 04:34:04.861
WONDERING. ARE WE CONCERNED AT

04:34:04.928 --> 04:34:06.196

DOLLARS THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY

04:34:13.570 --> 04:34:15.872
THIS IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THE

04:34:15.939 --> 04:34:17.240
INTEGRITY OF THE SCHOLASTIC

04:34:17.307 --> 04:34:19.309
EXPERIENCE THE EMPHASIS ON.

04:34:19.376 --> 04:34:21.144
UNIVERSITIES ACTUALLY BEING

04:34:21.211 --> 04:34:23.413
SCHOLASTICALLY ORIENTED BECAUSE

04:34:23.480 --> 04:34:24.848
IT IT'S GONE SO FAR THE OTHER

04:34:24.915 --> 04:34:26.516
DIRECTION THAT. I'VE I FEEL

04:34:26.583 --> 04:34:27.651
WE'VE BEEN LOSING THAT WE'VE

04:34:27.717 --> 04:34:29.219
BEEN LOSING THAT SCHOLASTIC

04:34:29.286 --> 04:34:30.887
EXPERIENCE FOR THE SAKE OF THE

04:34:30.954 --> 04:34:32.455
DOLLARS THAT COME ALONG WITH

04:34:32.522 --> 04:34:37.127
THE- WITH THAT WITH THE RIGHT

04:34:37.194 --> 04:34:37.761
WITH THAT'S LETTER DASH THROUGH

04:34:37.828 --> 04:34:42.399

COULD ALWAYS DEBATE THAT BUT

04:34:46.203 --> 04:34:46.670
CERTAINLY NOW THERE'S NO

04:34:46.736 --> 04:34:47.804
PROHIBITION ON ANY OTHER

04:34:47.871 --> 04:34:49.072
STUDENTS TO BEING

04:34:49.139 --> 04:34:51.408
ENTREPRENEURIAL IF WE LOOK AT

04:34:51.474 --> 04:34:52.709
MARK ZUCKERBERG HE STARTED

04:34:52.776 --> 04:34:54.511
FACEBOOK AS A COLLEGE STUDENT

04:34:54.578 --> 04:34:56.179
NOW HE DIDN'T FULLY MONETIZE

04:34:56.246 --> 04:34:57.948
ITALY AFTER YOU LEFT COLLEGE

04:34:58.014 --> 04:34:59.115
BUT HAD HE BEEN ABLE TO THERE

04:34:59.182 --> 04:35:00.650
WOULD HAVE BEEN NO PROHIBITION.

04:35:00.717 --> 04:35:02.352
AND I BELIEVE HE WAS A COMPUTER

04:35:02.419 --> 04:35:04.120
SCIENCE MAJOR SO HE COULD HAVE

04:35:04.187 --> 04:35:07.190

04:35:16.266 --> 04:35:22.372
STUDENT ADDITIONALLY WITH IN IF

04:35:22.439 --> 04:35:22.973
WE LOOK AT THE COLLEGE SPORTS

04:35:23.039 --> 04:35:28.111
INDUSTRY. THERE IS. CORRUPTION

04:35:28.178 --> 04:35:28.879
BECAUSE WE DON'T ALLOW THIS

04:35:28.945 --> 04:35:30.146

TO OTHERS THEN THE FBI

04:35:36.620 --> 04:35:38.421
INVESTIGATES AND THEN WHAT

04:35:38.488 --> 04:35:39.856

04:35:39.923 --> 04:35:41.491

WHERE THERE WAS NO LUCRATIVE

04:36:01.878 --> 04:36:03.380
REASON TO STAY IN SCHOOL

04:36:03.446 --> 04:36:06.216
PERHAPS SOME ATHLETES WOULD

FINISH THEIR COLLEGE DEGREE

04:36:08.251 --> 04:36:09.853

YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I'D LIKE

04:36:34.844 --> 04:36:35.578
TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL

04:36:35.645 --> 04:36:38.882
BECAUSE I HAVE. OF SOMEONE VERY

04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:41.217
DEAR TO ME WHO PLAYED ON THE

04:36:41.284 --> 04:36:43.820
USC FOOTBALL TEAM MY OLDEST SON

04:36:43.887 --> 04:36:45.121
BOBBY ARCHULETA AND HE PLAYED

04:36:45.188 --> 04:36:47.390
WITH BROAD THE PETE AND THEY

04:36:47.457 --> 04:36:50.093
SHARED BLOCKER SIDE BY SIDE SO

04:36:50.160 --> 04:36:50.994
I'M VERY PROUD OF HIS

04:36:51.061 --> 04:36:53.430
ACCOMPLISHMENT ANY WORSE IS

04:36:53.496 --> 04:36:54.731
ROSE BOWL RING VERY PROUDLY AS

04:36:54.798 --> 04:36:56.599
A U. S. C. TROJANS. AND HE TOLD

04:36:56.666 --> 04:36:58.902
ME STORIES THAT WAY BACK WHEN

04:36:58.969 --> 04:36:59.936
HOW SOME OF THE KIDS ON THAT

04:37:00.003 --> 04:37:02.706
FOOTBALL TEAM HAD TO ASK OTHER

04:37:02.772 --> 04:37:04.874
KIDS WITHIN THE STUDENT BODY

04:37:04.941 --> 04:37:06.042
FOR EXTRA DIMES NICKELS A

04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:07.877
COUPLE DOLLARS HERE AND THERE

04:37:07.944 --> 04:37:09.646
BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT AFFORD

04:37:09.713 --> 04:37:12.082
THAT LUNCH THAT WAS NEEDED AT

04:37:12.148 --> 04:37:14.150
THE OUTSIDE CAFETERIA. THAT THE

04:37:14.217 --> 04:37:15.552
FACT THAT IF THEIR AUTOMOBILE

04:37:15.618 --> 04:37:17.988
BROKE DOWN THEY COULDN'T TAKE

04:37:18.054 --> 04:37:20.357
CARE OF IT BY ASKING SOMEONE

04:37:20.423 --> 04:37:21.024
ELSE PICK THAT WOULD BE A

04:37:21.091 --> 04:37:23.326
VIOLATION OF THE NCAA RULING.

04:37:23.393 --> 04:37:26.463
AND SO THIS IS EXPLOITATION AT

04:37:26.529 --> 04:37:27.597
ITS FULLEST AND I THINK THAT

04:37:27.664 --> 04:37:29.599
NOW THAT THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S

04:37:29.666 --> 04:37:30.767
BEEN RECOGNIZED ACROSS THE

04:37:30.834 --> 04:37:32.602
NATION EVERYONE IS SAYING OH MY

04:37:32.669 --> 04:37:34.070
GOD WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

04:37:34.137 --> 04:37:35.672
CALIFORNIA WHAT IS CALIFORNIA

04:37:35.739 --> 04:37:37.307
DOING WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT

04:37:37.374 --> 04:37:39.009
THING MAKING SURE THAT THESE

04:37:39.075 --> 04:37:40.844
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ARE TAKEN

04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:43.079
CARE OF AND IT'S A DEADLY

04:37:43.146 --> 04:37:46.216
SENATORS. NOT EVERY SINGLE

04:37:46.282 --> 04:37:47.917
ATHLETE IS GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE

04:37:47.984 --> 04:37:50.520
FOR THIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT IT

04:37:50.587 --> 04:37:52.355
HAS TO DO WITH THEIR ABILITIES

04:37:52.422 --> 04:37:54.424
AND THEIR STATUS TO BE THE

04:37:54.491 --> 04:37:56.693
FIRST PART BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE

04:37:56.760 --> 04:37:57.260
BUT HOPE WE THEY'LL STE THE

04:37:57.327 --> 04:37:59.262
WELL TWO POINT THAT KIDS WILL

04:37:59.329 --> 04:38:02.499
BE ABLE TO RECEIVE NOT ONLY THE

04:38:02.565 --> 04:38:05.101
EDUCATION BUT THE NOURISHMENT

04:38:05.168 --> 04:38:07.370
THAT THEY NEED EVERY SINGLE BIT

04:38:07.437 --> 04:38:09.539
COMPETE. SO I'M THINKING THAT

04:38:09.606 --> 04:38:11.107
CALIFORNIA BEN IS LEAVE THE WAY

04:38:11.174 --> 04:38:12.809
AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND OPEN THE

04:38:12.876 --> 04:38:14.477

BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL BECAUSE-

04:40:07.857 --> 04:40:09.826
IT IS AN ANTITRUST VIOLATION

04:40:09.893 --> 04:40:11.895
THAT IS THE LEGAL OPINION. AND

04:40:11.961 --> 04:40:13.563
IF WE LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF

04:40:13.630 --> 04:40:15.465
THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN

04:40:15.532 --> 04:40:18.701
TAKEN AGAINST THE NC TWO WAY ON

04:40:18.768 --> 04:40:20.370

ALMOST EVERY LAWSUIT BROUGHT

04:40:29.712 --> 04:40:31.214
AGAINST THEM IN A QUESTION OF

04:40:31.281 --> 04:40:34.951
ANTI TRUST. SO THE LEGAL

04:40:35.018 --> 04:40:38.188
OPINIONS THAT BOTH WE HAVE

04:40:38.254 --> 04:40:40.156

04:41:07.717 --> 04:41:10.119
PERMITTED BOTH THREAT. BUT I

04:41:10.186 --> 04:41:11.254

LISTEN TO LAST WEEK YOU KNOW

04:43:15.712 --> 04:43:17.113
THIS IS ALSO A GENDER PARITY

04:43:17.180 --> 04:43:19.048
ISSUE. I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL

04:43:19.115 --> 04:43:20.550
WITH THE MILLERS. IN RIVERSIDE

04:43:20.616 --> 04:43:22.652

YOU READ YOU SURE I WAS A

04:43:26.089 --> 04:43:26.989
BETTER BALL PLAYER IN HIGH

04:43:27.056 --> 04:43:29.625
SCHOOL. BUT THE WNBA DIDN'T

04:43:29.692 --> 04:43:30.727
EXIST THEN IN THE WOMEN IN THE

04:43:30.793 --> 04:43:33.496
WNBA DON'T MAKE. ANY DON'T MAKE

04:43:33.563 --> 04:43:34.731
A DIME ON THE DOLLAR COMPARED

04:43:34.797 --> 04:43:36.766
TO THAT MAN IN THE NBA. ALSO

04:43:36.833 --> 04:43:38.835
CHERYL IN COLLEGE AT USC HAD

04:43:38.901 --> 04:43:41.270
BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS. SHE WOULD

04:43:41.337 --> 04:43:43.373
HAVE BENEFITTED FROM HER INNATE

04:43:43.439 --> 04:43:46.042

BROTHER DID HAD A FULL CAREER

04:43:47.643 --> 04:43:49.879
IN THE NBA AND CHERYL WAS NOT

04:43:49.946 --> 04:43:51.347
ABLE TO DO THIS SO THIS IS ALSO

04:43:51.414 --> 04:43:53.015
A GENDER PARITY ISSUE. FOR

04:43:53.082 --> 04:43:54.050
WOMEN ATHLETES AT THE

04:43:54.117 --> 04:43:57.854

ON BENEFIT FINANCIALLY WHEN

04:43:59.822 --> 04:44:00.390
THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME

04:44:00.456 --> 04:44:01.057
OPPORTUNITIES THEIR MALE

COUNTERPARTS. TO GO ON INTO

04:44:03.826 --> 04:44:06.629
PROFESSIONAL ATHLETICS ANOTHER

04:44:06.696 --> 04:44:07.196
REASON TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF

AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE.

04:44:16.806 --> 04:44:18.374
THIS IS THE KIND OF DEBATES

04:44:18.441 --> 04:44:18.941
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE ON THE

04:44:19.008 --> 04:44:21.277
FLOOR OF THE SENATE. CORDIAL

04:44:21.344 --> 04:44:22.845
FOUGHT FULL WITH GOOD

04:44:22.912 --> 04:44:25.181
BACKGROUNDS AND TRY TO. REACH A

04:44:25.248 --> 04:44:29.786
CONSENSUS. YOU KNOW I REALLY

04:44:29.852 --> 04:44:31.721
BELIEVE THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL

04:44:31.788 --> 04:44:33.156
INSTITUTIONS THEIR PRIMARY

04:44:33.222 --> 04:44:35.191
PURPOSE IS TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS

04:44:35.258 --> 04:44:37.326
WE NEED TO HAVE A GREAT

04:44:37.393 --> 04:44:37.894
EDUCATED WORK FORCE IN THIS

04:44:37.960 --> 04:44:38.461
COUNTRY FOR GOING TO COMPETE

04:44:38.528 --> 04:44:41.164
GLOBALLY. BUT I AM REMINDED OF

04:44:41.230 --> 04:44:42.632
A STORY AS I'M AS I'M SITTING

04:44:42.698 --> 04:44:44.867
HERE IN HER TESTIMONY VOTED NO

04:44:44.934 --> 04:44:45.435
ON THIS ONE ORIGINALLY CAME

04:44:45.501 --> 04:44:49.272
BEFORE US. AND I HEARD OF A

04:44:49.338 --> 04:44:51.874
STORY ABOUT A YOUNG MAN THAT.

04:44:51.941 --> 04:44:53.843
WAS PLAYING FOOTBALL AND- HE

04:44:53.910 --> 04:44:56.579
GOT OFFERED A PRETTY A PRETTY

04:44:56.646 --> 04:45:00.016
NICE CHECK. TO GO RIGHT AWAY

04:45:00.082 --> 04:45:02.018
BEFORE HE GRADUATED FROM

04:45:02.084 --> 04:45:02.652
COLLEGE TO GO TO A PROFESSIONAL

04:45:02.718 --> 04:45:05.888
FOOTBALL TEAM. AND HIS MOTHER

04:45:05.955 --> 04:45:07.690
SAID NO YOU'RE GOING TO FINISH

04:45:07.757 --> 04:45:08.291
YOUR SCHOOL. BEFORE YOU GO ON

04:45:08.357 --> 04:45:11.494
TO THE PROS. AND ENDED UP

04:45:11.561 --> 04:45:14.897
GETTING A HORRIFIC INJURY. THAT

04:45:14.964 --> 04:45:15.398
COMPLETELY DECIMATED HIS

04:45:15.465 --> 04:45:19.068
FOOTBALL CAREER. SO I'M LOOKING

04:45:19.135 --> 04:45:20.403
AT THIS FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE

04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:23.139
NOW I'M THINKING THAT MAYBE IF

04:45:23.206 --> 04:45:25.541
WE ALLOW SOME OF THESE ATHLETES

04:45:25.608 --> 04:45:26.142
ARE REALLY HAVE STRONG PROMISE

04:45:26.209 --> 04:45:29.178
TO BECOME PROFESSIONALS. MAYBE

04:45:29.245 --> 04:45:30.079
WITH SOME OF THE INCOME THAT

04:45:30.146 --> 04:45:32.048
THEY CAN GET DURING THEIR

04:45:32.114 --> 04:45:33.616
FORMIDABLE YEARS IN COLLEGE

04:45:33.683 --> 04:45:34.884
THAT THEY WILL SEE THE BENEFITS

04:45:34.951 --> 04:45:36.152
OF COMPLETING THEIR EDUCATION

04:45:36.219 --> 04:45:37.553
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME. CAN IN

04:45:37.620 --> 04:45:39.121
THE FINANCIAL COMPENSATION AND

04:45:39.188 --> 04:45:42.658
THEY NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND

04:45:42.725 --> 04:45:43.226
MAYBE EVEN DO VERY WELL WITH

04:45:43.292 --> 04:45:45.461
THEIR TALENTS. BUT LASTLY I

04:45:45.528 --> 04:45:49.098
HAVE TO TELL YOU. I'M VERY

04:45:49.165 --> 04:45:51.200
PROUD OF MY DAUGHTER I HAVE A

04:45:51.267 --> 04:45:51.767
DAUGHTER ONE DAUGHTER THREE

04:45:51.834 --> 04:45:54.704
SONS AND. MY DAUGHTER CAME TO

04:45:54.770 --> 04:45:56.906
ME WHEN. SHE WENT TO HIGH

04:45:56.973 --> 04:45:58.274
SCHOOL AND SHE WAS NEVER

04:45:58.341 --> 04:45:59.709
INVOLVED IN SCHOLASTIC SPORTS

04:45:59.775 --> 04:46:01.911
AT ALL. AND SHE GOES DOWN I'M

04:46:01.978 --> 04:46:04.146
GONNA TRY OUT FOR WATER POLO. I

04:46:04.213 --> 04:46:06.449
SAID BERNIE THAT'S A FANTASTIC

04:46:06.516 --> 04:46:07.083
IDEA I THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT

04:46:07.149 --> 04:46:09.852
IT'S A GREAT SPORT. BUT SHE

04:46:09.919 --> 04:46:12.855
CALLED ME BACK AND SHE GOES. I

04:46:12.922 --> 04:46:14.690
REALLY DON'T THINK THIS IS FOR

04:46:14.757 --> 04:46:15.258
ME THAT I THINK I'M GOING TO

04:46:15.324 --> 04:46:17.426
QUIT I SAID. DON'T DON'T QUIT

04:46:17.493 --> 04:46:18.594
WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT SHE GOES

04:46:18.661 --> 04:46:20.963
WELL I THOUGHT THAT. WATER POLO

04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:23.799
WAS VOLLEY BALL IN THE WATER. I

04:46:23.866 --> 04:46:26.235
SAID NO IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

04:46:26.302 --> 04:46:26.769
PHYSICAL THAN THAT BUT YOU

04:46:26.836 --> 04:46:28.504
SIGNED UP FOR IT. AND YOU NEED

04:46:28.571 --> 04:46:31.374
TO STAY IN THE SPORT. REASON

04:46:31.440 --> 04:46:33.676
WHY I MENTION THIS IS BECAUSE

04:46:33.743 --> 04:46:36.012
SHE DID VERY WELL IN WATER POLO

04:46:36.078 --> 04:46:37.847
IN THE FOUR YEARS THAT SHE WAS

04:46:37.914 --> 04:46:38.381
AT LEAST SO VEHICLE. HIGH

04:46:38.447 --> 04:46:41.784
SCHOOL. AND THEN SHE APPLIED TO

04:46:41.851 --> 04:46:43.352
GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF

04:46:43.419 --> 04:46:46.055
CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO. AND SHE

04:46:46.122 --> 04:46:47.757
WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT

04:46:47.823 --> 04:46:50.526
HER VERY HIGH GPA WASN'T FOUR

04:46:50.593 --> 04:46:53.229
POINT OH FIVE AND SHE DIDN'T

04:46:53.296 --> 04:46:53.863
THINK THAT SHE WAS GOING TO GET

04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:57.600
IN. BUT OUR COACH SAID HEY YOU

04:46:57.667 --> 04:46:58.200
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT PLAYING

04:46:58.267 --> 04:47:02.171
WATER POLO. AND SHE GOES NO

04:47:02.238 --> 04:47:04.273
SHOES GO TALK TO THE COACH. SO

04:47:04.340 --> 04:47:07.009
SHE WENT TO THE COACH AND THE

04:47:07.076 --> 04:47:07.610
COACH DOESN'T WANT TO HER ON

FOUR YEARS AT UCSC. AND LET ME

04:47:44.847 --> 04:47:46.782
TELL YOU IT WAS A STRUGGLE. I

04:47:46.849 --> 04:47:48.084
MEAN SHE'S FORTUNATE SHE HAD A

04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:49.452
BAD THE COULD AFFORD TO PUT HER

04:47:49.518 --> 04:47:51.287
THROUGH SCHOOL. BUT SHE HAD A

04:47:51.354 --> 04:47:52.722
LOT OF COLLEAGUES THAT WERE

04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:54.724
PLAYING WATER POLO. THERE

04:47:54.790 --> 04:47:55.291
REALLY STRUGGLED TO MAKE IT

04:47:55.358 --> 04:47:58.961
THROUGH. AND SO THE TESTIMONY

04:47:59.028 --> 04:48:01.097
THAT I'VE HEARD HERE TODAY. HI

04:48:01.163 --> 04:48:02.732
IS CHANGING MY MIND ON THIS

04:48:02.798 --> 04:48:05.701
VOTE. AND AGAIN CALIFORNIA

04:48:05.768 --> 04:48:06.302
SOMETIMES JUST HAS TO LEAD THE

04:48:06.369 --> 04:48:09.538
WAY. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

04:48:09.605 --> 04:48:10.640
SITUATIONS WHERE I THINK WE

04:48:10.706 --> 04:48:13.509
NEED TO BLAZE A TRAIL. FOR

04:48:13.576 --> 04:48:14.143
THOSE REASONS I'M GONNA SUPPORT

04:48:14.210 --> 04:48:16.979
SB TO A SIX. THANK YOU CENTER

04:48:17.046 --> 04:48:20.383
STONE CENTER NIELSEN. MISTER

PRESIDENT LEADING DOWN THE

04:48:21.417 --> 04:48:22.785
SENATE THIS IS KIND OF A RARE

04:48:22.852 --> 04:48:24.587
EXPERIENCE FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE

04:48:24.654 --> 04:48:28.024
ALWAYS SAID VERY SELDOM DO THIS

04:48:28.090 --> 04:48:28.591
DEBATE ON THE FOREVER CHANGE

04:48:28.658 --> 04:48:33.462
ANY MINDS. EVEN MY OWN. I CAME

04:48:33.529 --> 04:48:34.897
HERE TODAY QUITE OPPOSED TO

04:48:34.964 --> 04:48:38.834
THIS LEGISLATION. AND I THINK

04:48:38.901 --> 04:48:39.402
WE HAD IT ONCE BEFORE BEFORE

04:48:39.468 --> 04:48:43.072
XIN I DID VOTE NO. THAT ARE

04:48:43.139 --> 04:48:43.606
LISTENING TO THE DEBATE I

04:48:43.673 --> 04:48:46.842
REALIZED SOMETHING. NOW I WAS A

04:48:46.909 --> 04:48:49.178
SCHOLARSHIP ATHLETE BUT I WAS

04:48:49.245 --> 04:48:49.779
NEVER ANYBODY GOING TO PAY ME

04:48:49.845 --> 04:48:55.151
FOR ANYTHING AT ALL. TO ENDORSE.

04:48:55.217 --> 04:48:55.618
BUT WHAT I GAINED FROM

04:48:55.685 --> 04:48:58.387
ATHLETICS. TO THE KIND OF HUMAN

04:48:58.454 --> 04:49:02.324
BEING THAT I AM. HAS MADE SUCH

04:49:02.391 --> 04:49:05.528
A DIFFERENCE IN MY LIFE SUCCESS.

04:49:05.594 --> 04:49:07.096
I HAVE IN MY OFFICE COUPLE

04:49:07.163 --> 04:49:08.464
FOOTBALLS IN MY COLLEGE SHOT

04:49:08.531 --> 04:49:10.633
PUT AND DISCUS AND A SIGN IN

04:49:10.700 --> 04:49:11.167
FRONT OF A THAT SAYS HEAVY

04:49:11.233 --> 04:49:13.769
LIFTING. AND HEAVY LIFTING THEN

04:49:13.836 --> 04:49:16.672
WAS BEING IN SHAPE FOR SPORTS

04:49:16.739 --> 04:49:17.273
NIGHT AND COMPETED IN TRACK A

04:49:17.339 --> 04:49:19.275
LITTLE BIT AS A MASTER LATER.

04:49:19.341 --> 04:49:21.143
AND FOOTBALL AND WORKING ON THE

04:49:21.210 --> 04:49:23.746
FARM THAT WAS A HEAVY LIFTING.

04:49:23.813 --> 04:49:25.314
BUT NOW THE HEAVY LIFTING IS

04:49:25.381 --> 04:49:25.881
ALL THESE THINGS THAT WE DO

04:49:25.948 --> 04:49:29.452
HERE. AND THE GREATEST THING I

04:49:29.518 --> 04:49:29.952
LEARNED IN ATHLETICS WAS

04:49:30.019 --> 04:49:35.191
DISAPPOINTING. WELL WHAT OF

04:49:35.257 --> 04:49:35.758
THAT THAT KIND OF PUT IT IN

04:49:35.825 --> 04:49:38.527
CONTEXT HERE FOR ME TODAY.

04:49:38.594 --> 04:49:40.062
BECAUSE I WAS ENVISIONING THESE

04:49:40.129 --> 04:49:43.766
LEGIONS OF AGENTS. SPORTS

04:49:43.833 --> 04:49:44.233
AGENTS DESCENDING OUR

04:49:44.300 --> 04:49:48.904
UNIVERSITIES. AND THEY'RE NOT

04:49:48.971 --> 04:49:51.540
ALL THE MOST ETHICAL PEOPLE.

04:49:51.607 --> 04:49:53.576
BUT THE POINT THAT I MAKE. THE

04:49:53.642 --> 04:49:57.813
GOOD ATHLETES. OR ANYONE WHO

04:49:57.880 --> 04:49:59.281
EVEN COMPETES IN ATHLETICS EVEN.

04:49:59.348 --> 04:50:03.252
JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WHATEVER. IT

04:50:03.319 --> 04:50:04.787
DOES SOMETHING POSITIVE I

04:50:04.854 --> 04:50:07.556
BELIEVE TO THE HUMAN BEING THE

04:50:07.623 --> 04:50:08.124
HUMAN CHARACTER IN THE HUMAN

04:50:08.190 --> 04:50:12.628
SOUL. AND SO IF SOMEONE IT IS

04:50:12.695 --> 04:50:17.366
SO GOOD. THE DAVID DEVELOPED AN

04:50:17.433 --> 04:50:21.637
ECONOMIC PRESENCE AND POTENTIAL.

04:50:21.704 --> 04:50:25.307
BUT MAYBE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

04:50:25.374 --> 04:50:25.875
AND NOW RATHER THAN BEING A

04:50:25.941 --> 04:50:28.544
VERY STRONG NO VOTE. I TO WILL

04:50:28.611 --> 04:50:33.516
BE AND I WILL. THANK YOU CENTER

04:50:33.582 --> 04:50:38.587
NIELSEN. CENTER JACKSON YES I

04:50:38.654 --> 04:50:40.589
FEEL COMPELLED TO STAND UP BUT

04:50:40.656 --> 04:50:41.991
IT IS RESULT OF THE COMMENTS BY

04:50:42.057 --> 04:50:42.858
MY GOOD COLLEAGUE FROM LOS

04:50:42.925 --> 04:50:44.994
ANGELES BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING A

04:50:45.060 --> 04:50:46.395
HISTORY OF MOVING IN THE

04:50:46.462 --> 04:50:47.897
DIRECTION OF RECOGNIZING

04:50:47.963 --> 04:50:50.399
RESPECTING STUDENT ATHLETES. AS

04:50:50.466 --> 04:50:52.067
A YOUNG WOMAN BELIEVE IT OR NOT

04:50:52.134 --> 04:50:53.035
I WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD

04:50:53.102 --> 04:50:54.937
TENNIS PLAYER BUT I WAS

04:50:55.004 --> 04:50:56.772
INELIGIBLE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS TO

04:50:56.839 --> 04:50:59.475
COLLEGE BECAUSE SITTING GIVE

04:50:59.542 --> 04:51:02.611
SCHOLARSHIPS TO. GIRLS TO PLAY.

04:51:02.678 --> 04:51:03.445
FOURTEEN COLLEGE THAT OF COURSE

04:51:03.512 --> 04:51:06.015
IS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND AS

04:51:06.081 --> 04:51:08.617
A RESULT WE NOW HAVE COLLEGE.

04:51:08.684 --> 04:51:10.519
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR WOMEN IN

04:51:10.586 --> 04:51:13.322
SPORTS WE HAVE WOMEN WHO ARE

04:51:13.389 --> 04:51:14.957
LEADING THE UNITED STATES IN

04:51:15.024 --> 04:51:16.625
GOLD MEDALS AT THE OLYMPICS

04:51:16.692 --> 04:51:18.294
BECAUSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

04:51:18.360 --> 04:51:19.995
COMPETE AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

04:51:20.062 --> 04:51:21.831
A LIVING AT IT OR CERTAINLY NOT

04:51:21.897 --> 04:51:23.599
HAVING TO GO OUT. AND DRIVE IN

04:51:23.666 --> 04:51:25.367
UBER IN THE EVENING AFTER THEY

04:51:25.434 --> 04:51:27.670
WORK OUT AND TRY VERY HARD TO

04:51:27.736 --> 04:51:29.839
EXCEL AND TO AND TO LIVE UP TO

04:51:29.905 --> 04:51:32.741
THEIR- ATHLETIC EXPECTATIONS SO

04:51:32.808 --> 04:51:34.610
WE'RE SEEING MOVEMENT IN THAT

04:51:34.677 --> 04:51:35.911
DIRECTION. AND I THINK IT'S

04:51:35.978 --> 04:51:37.112
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

04:51:37.179 --> 04:51:39.181
RECOGNIZE THAT THESE YOUNG

04:51:39.248 --> 04:51:41.450
PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXTRAORDINARY

04:51:41.517 --> 04:51:43.552
TALENT CANNOT DO IT ON THEIR

04:51:43.619 --> 04:51:49.225
OWN. I ALSO HAVE A GRANDSON WHO

04:51:49.291 --> 04:51:54.396
IS SIX FOOT SEVEN AND IS. FOR

04:51:54.463 --> 04:51:56.599
GORE DEPENDING AT A UNIVERSITY

04:51:56.665 --> 04:51:57.333
AND WE WENT TO THE NC TO ACE

04:51:57.399 --> 04:51:58.200
LAST YEAR IS A STARTING PLAYER

04:51:58.267 --> 04:51:59.034
HE HAS A FOUR YEAR SCHOLARSHIP

04:51:59.101 --> 04:52:01.136
TO COLLEGE. BUT THAT ISN'T

04:52:01.203 --> 04:52:02.972
ENOUGH. WE END UP HAVING TO

04:52:03.038 --> 04:52:04.907
SEND THE MONEY EVERY NOW AND

04:52:04.974 --> 04:52:05.908
THEN HE WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE FOR

04:52:05.975 --> 04:52:07.643
YOUR BIRTHDAY WELL. THERE'S A

04:52:07.710 --> 04:52:09.778
LITTLE HAMBURGER STORE AROUND

04:52:09.845 --> 04:52:11.180
THE CORNER I COULD SURE USE

04:52:11.247 --> 04:52:12.982
SOME MONEY. BECAUSE I REALLY

04:52:13.048 --> 04:52:15.284
LIKE THOSE BURGERS AFTER A FOUR

04:52:15.351 --> 04:52:16.752
HOUR WORK OUT WHEN I'VE LOST

04:52:16.819 --> 04:52:18.087
FIVE TO TEN POUNDS. NOT

04:52:18.153 --> 04:52:19.788
COMPLAINING. BUT THIS IS THE

04:52:19.855 --> 04:52:22.124
REALITY THIS IS THIS IS THE

04:52:22.191 --> 04:52:24.293
KIND OF THING WE NEED TO

04:52:24.360 --> 04:52:25.928
REINFORCE AND SUPPORT THESE

04:52:25.995 --> 04:52:27.897
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ACHIEVING

04:52:27.963 --> 04:52:32.234
EXCELLENCE. WHO ARE JUST TRYING

04:52:32.301 --> 04:52:33.669
TO GO THROUGH COLLEGE AND I

04:52:33.736 --> 04:52:35.504
WILL TELL YOU BEING AN ATHLETE

04:52:35.571 --> 04:52:37.640
AND A STUDENTATHLETE AND DOING

04:52:37.706 --> 04:52:39.241
WELL IN SCHOOL AND DOING BOTH

04:52:39.308 --> 04:52:42.845
IS NOT AN EASY TASK. THE NOTION

04:52:42.912 --> 04:52:43.913
THAT THEY COULD DâN WE

04:52:43.979 --> 04:52:46.315
ACTUALLY WOULD GIVE THEM THE

04:52:46.382 --> 04:52:49.451
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE SOME

04:52:49.518 --> 04:52:50.586
ADDITIONAL MONEY SO THAT THEY

04:52:50.653 --> 04:52:52.187
CAN ACTUALLY Là. WHILE IN

04:52:52.254 --> 04:52:56.458
SCHOOL I IS NOT AN

04:52:56.525 --> 04:52:59.762
EXTRAORDINARY REACH AND BE FOR

04:52:59.828 --> 04:53:01.430
THOSE THREES THE FACT THAT.

04:53:01.497 --> 04:53:03.732
WHEN YOU SAW. AFTER THE WINTER.

04:53:03.799 --> 04:53:04.366
I'LL BE ABLE TO GET SOME MONEY

04:53:04.433 --> 04:53:07.703

06:10:11.489 --> 06:10:13.157
KIND OF BACK IN THE SAME PLACE

06:10:13.224 --> 06:10:13.824
WHO WERE EARLIER IN THE WEEK

06:10:13.891 --> 06:10:16.060
AND NOT TALKING ABOUT. CHARTER

06:10:16.127 --> 06:10:18.162
SCHOOLS VERSUS TALKING ABOUT

06:10:18.229 --> 06:10:18.763
THE BROADER CHALLENGES FACING

06:10:18.829 --> 06:10:23.167
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. AND ONCE

06:10:23.234 --> 06:10:23.768
AGAIN IT CERTAINLY PUTS ME IN

06:10:23.834 --> 06:10:24.368
CONFLICT WITH THE BILL THAT'S

06:10:24.435 --> 06:10:28.839
BEFORE YOU. WHEN YOU THINK

06:10:28.906 --> 06:10:30.441
ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE

06:10:30.508 --> 06:10:32.376
IN OUR SCHOOLS THERE'S NO DOUBT

06:10:32.443 --> 06:10:33.477
THAT THE TEACHERS ARE ON THE

06:10:33.544 --> 06:10:35.880
FRONTLINE OF THAT CHALLENGE.

06:10:35.947 --> 06:10:36.380
OUR SUPERINTENDENTS OUR

06:10:36.447 --> 06:10:37.615
PRINCIPLES OUR SCHOOL BOARD

06:10:37.682 --> 06:10:39.984
MEMBERS. AND IT'S NOT AN EASY

06:10:40.051 --> 06:10:45.556
CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE. AND

06:10:45.623 --> 06:10:46.090
YET WE IF IT'S BY THE MOST

06:10:46.157 --> 06:10:46.624
IMPORTANT THING WE DO IS A

06:10:46.691 --> 06:10:51.929
STATE. I STATURE KATE OUR KIDS.

06:10:51.996 --> 06:10:52.463
AND SO I KNOW IT'S A VERY

06:10:52.530 --> 06:10:54.832
DIFFICULT JOB AND- CERTAINLY

06:10:54.899 --> 06:10:56.167
WE'VE HAD FINANCIAL CHALLENGES.

06:10:56.233 --> 06:10:59.270
WE HAVE SOCIAL ECONOMIC

06:10:59.337 --> 06:11:03.908
CHALLENGES. THAT THAT MAKE IT

06:11:03.975 --> 06:11:08.546
DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT IF I

06:11:08.613 --> 06:11:12.016
WERE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND

06:11:12.083 --> 06:11:12.650
I HAD SCHOOLS THAT WERE FAILING

06:11:12.717 --> 06:11:17.221
IN MY DISTRICT. THAT WHEN A

06:11:17.288 --> 06:11:18.623
GROUP OF PARENTS WOULD COME TO

06:11:18.689 --> 06:11:21.158
ME AND SAY WE'RE NOT HAPPY THE

06:11:21.225 --> 06:11:22.727
SCHOOLS NOT WORKING FOR OUR

06:11:22.793 --> 06:11:24.061
KIDS WE LOOKING FOR

06:11:24.128 --> 06:11:26.597
ALTERNATIVES THAT I WOULD. I

06:11:26.664 --> 06:11:30.201
UNDERSTAND THAT SENTIMENT. I

06:11:30.267 --> 06:11:33.070
WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. THAT

06:11:33.137 --> 06:11:34.105
IT'S A STRESSFUL TIME FOR THEM

06:11:34.171 --> 06:11:37.441
AND FOR US. BUT I KNOW THAT IT

06:11:37.508 --> 06:11:39.677
THAT CHARTER SCHOOL WAS FORMED.

06:11:39.744 --> 06:11:41.545
IT'S GONNA DIMINISH THE

06:11:41.612 --> 06:11:42.146
RESOURCES THAT I WOULD HAVE IS

06:11:42.213 --> 06:11:44.915
A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. TO HELP

06:11:44.982 --> 06:11:46.884
THAT THE REST OF THE KIDS. AND

06:11:46.951 --> 06:11:50.021
THIS IS THE THIS IS THE- THE

06:11:50.087 --> 06:11:50.721
NATURAL CONFLICT THAT CHARTER

06:11:50.788 --> 06:11:54.191
SCHOOL EFFORTS. COME INTO PLAY

06:11:54.258 --> 06:11:55.092
WITH OUR REGULAR PUBLIC SCHOOL

06:11:55.159 --> 06:11:58.496
SYSTEM IS BECAUSE- BOTH SIDES

06:11:58.562 --> 06:11:59.897
ARE TRYING TO DO WHAT'S BEST.

06:11:59.964 --> 06:12:02.533
THOSE PARENTS OF FIVE POTENTIAL

06:12:02.600 --> 06:12:04.201
CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN THE

06:12:04.268 --> 06:12:06.103
SCHOOL BOARDS SUPERINTENDENTS

06:12:06.170 --> 06:12:08.406
THE TEACHERS ALL THE OTHERS

06:12:08.472 --> 06:12:08.906
THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE

06:12:08.973 --> 06:12:09.840
REGULAR SCHOOL SYSTEM I KNOW

06:12:09.907 --> 06:12:12.543
THAT THEY'RE NOT HAPPY. BUT

06:12:12.610 --> 06:12:15.513
WHEN THAT CONFLICT OCCURS.

06:12:15.579 --> 06:12:16.147
THERE IS SELF INTEREST INVOLVED

06:12:16.213 --> 06:12:19.784
IN THE CHOICE. MEANING THAT.

06:12:19.850 --> 06:12:20.251
SCHOOL BOARDS ARE NOT

06:12:20.317 --> 06:12:25.256
INTERESTED. IT FOR A EIGHT AND

06:12:25.322 --> 06:12:27.658
IN MOST CASES IN AND SUPPORTING.

06:12:27.725 --> 06:12:29.960
NEW PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS OKAY

06:12:30.027 --> 06:12:31.996
THAT'S THE CONFLICT AND YET WE

06:12:32.063 --> 06:12:33.931
HAVE A LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR

06:12:33.998 --> 06:12:34.565
THESE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS TO

06:12:34.632 --> 06:12:37.268
BE FORMED. A PROCESS FOR THEM

06:12:37.334 --> 06:12:39.170
TO FILE APPLICATIONS TO CREATE

06:12:39.236 --> 06:12:43.340
A SCHOOL. AND SO AND THERE YOU

06:12:43.407 --> 06:12:47.344
HAVE THE CONFLICT SO. IF THAT

06:12:47.411 --> 06:12:49.814
CHARTER SCHOOL GETS APPROVED

06:12:49.880 --> 06:12:51.449
MAYBE NOT BY THAT SCHOOL BOARD

06:12:51.515 --> 06:12:52.883
MAYBE ITS APPEAL TO THE COUNTY

06:12:52.950 --> 06:12:56.454
BOARD OF THE STATE BOARD. NOW

06:12:56.520 --> 06:12:57.054
YOU GET TO THE ISSUE OF WHERE

06:12:57.121 --> 06:12:57.688
IS THAT CHARTER SCHOOL GOING TO

06:12:57.755 --> 06:13:00.424
BE LOCATED. AND YOU GET BACK TO

06:13:00.491 --> 06:13:02.426
THAT CONFLICT AGAIN IF THERE

06:13:02.493 --> 06:13:03.828
ARE AT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES IN

06:13:03.894 --> 06:13:05.996
A SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND THAT THE

06:13:06.063 --> 06:13:07.298
COMMUNITY OF PARENTS IN THAT

06:13:07.364 --> 06:13:08.432
PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL WANT TO

06:13:08.499 --> 06:13:10.801
USE THAT FACILITY. THERE'S

06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:11.402
CONFLICT AGAIN BECAUSE THERE'S

06:13:11.469 --> 06:13:13.471
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AGAIN.

06:13:13.537 --> 06:13:14.472
BECAUSE OF THE ISSUE I

06:13:14.538 --> 06:13:16.907
DISCUSSED EARLIER. SO WHAT IS

06:13:16.974 --> 06:13:18.342
THAT NEWLY FORMED CHARTER

06:13:18.409 --> 06:13:20.845
SCHOOL TO DO WELL THERE. THEY

06:13:20.911 --> 06:13:22.279
KNOW THAT THEY'RE BRINGING IN A

06:13:22.346 --> 06:13:23.380
PARENT COMMUNITY IN THE FROM

06:13:23.447 --> 06:13:24.982
THE NEIGHBORHOODS. FOR THE

06:13:25.049 --> 06:13:26.350
COMMUNITY THAT'S AROUND THAT

06:13:26.417 --> 06:13:28.652
SCHOOL BUT YET THEY CAN'T USE

06:13:28.719 --> 06:13:30.187
THAT FACILITY THAT'S NEARBY.

06:13:30.254 --> 06:13:32.123
BUT YET THEY WANT ONE SO THEY

06:13:32.189 --> 06:13:33.290
LOOK AROUND THEY TRY TO FIND

06:13:33.357 --> 06:13:34.892
EMPTY OFFICES OR OTHER

06:13:34.959 --> 06:13:36.360
FACILITIES TO BEGIN THEIR

06:13:36.427 --> 06:13:38.129
SCHOOL. AND SOMETIMES THAT

06:13:38.195 --> 06:13:41.332
MEANS THAT THE LOCATION OF THAT

06:13:41.398 --> 06:13:43.334
SCHOOL GOES OUTSIDE A LINE. A

06:13:43.400 --> 06:13:47.171
LINE ON A MAP. AND THEIR THEIR

06:13:47.238 --> 06:13:48.806
VIEW IS I KNOW THAT THEY WANT

06:13:48.873 --> 06:13:51.208
TO MAKE IT A COMFORTABLE PLACE

06:13:51.275 --> 06:13:52.109
THEY WANT TO MAKE A CONVENIENT

06:13:52.176 --> 06:13:53.978
PLACE TO LOOK FOR TRANSIT

06:13:54.044 --> 06:13:55.479
ROUTES THAT TO LOCATE THAT

06:13:55.546 --> 06:13:56.147
SCHOOL THEY WANT TO MAKE IT AS

06:13:56.213 --> 06:13:57.648
CLOSE AS THEY CAN'T FROM THAT

06:13:57.715 --> 06:14:00.151
COMMUNITY OF PARENTS THAT HAVE

06:14:00.217 --> 06:14:00.651
COME OUT OF THAT SCHOOL

06:14:00.718 --> 06:14:02.520
DISTRICT. THAT SCHOOL AREA. AND

06:14:02.586 --> 06:14:04.522
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS. AND SO YOU

06:14:04.588 --> 06:14:06.290
HAVE A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL

06:14:06.357 --> 06:14:06.857
THAT IS OUTSIDE OF A LINE A

06:14:06.924 --> 06:14:10.895
LINE ON A MAP. AND A BILL LIKE

06:14:10.961 --> 06:14:12.963
THIS CREATES A SERIOUS

06:14:13.030 --> 06:14:15.766
IMPEDIMENT TO THE ABILITY. TO

06:14:15.833 --> 06:14:18.035
HAVE THAT CHARTER SCHOOL

06:14:18.102 --> 06:14:19.637
FUNCTION BECAUSE THEY NEED A

06:14:19.703 --> 06:14:21.939
LOCATION WITHIN SIGHT OF A LIE

06:14:22.006 --> 06:14:24.108
NOT OUTSIDE OF A LINE I THINK

06:14:24.175 --> 06:14:25.276
ABOUT IT IN YOUR DISTRICT

06:14:25.342 --> 06:14:27.278
MEMBERS THE LINES THAT ARE ON

06:14:27.344 --> 06:14:29.146
THE MAP FOR YOU I KNOW IN MY

06:14:29.213 --> 06:14:31.415
AREA THIS IS GOING TO SURPRISE

06:14:31.482 --> 06:14:33.551
YOU. BUT THE SENATOR FROM NAPA

06:14:33.617 --> 06:14:36.854
COUNTY. REPRESENTS AN AREA.

06:14:36.921 --> 06:14:39.990
THAT THE IN MY DISTRICT. THIRTY

06:14:40.057 --> 06:14:40.825
FORTY MILES AWAY FROM HIS

06:14:40.891 --> 06:14:43.027
OFFICE IT'S ONLY ABOUT FIVE

06:14:43.093 --> 06:14:44.962
MILES FROM MINE BUT IT'S A LINE

06:14:45.029 --> 06:14:45.462
ON A MAP. HAPPENS TO BE

06:14:45.529 --> 06:14:48.532
PLEASANT HILL. AND THAT'S

06:14:48.599 --> 06:14:50.134
THAT'S THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE FIND

06:14:50.201 --> 06:14:52.203
OURSELVES IN. IS IT REASONABLE

06:14:52.269 --> 06:14:52.803
WELL IT'S WHERE THE LINES ARE

06:14:52.870 --> 06:14:55.773
DRAWN. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

06:14:55.840 --> 06:14:57.808
IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO THAT'S

06:14:57.875 --> 06:14:58.642
WHAT HAPPENS WITH OUR CITY

06:14:58.709 --> 06:15:01.645
LINES TO. BUT THOSE PARENTS ARE

06:15:01.712 --> 06:15:03.380
NOT TRYING TO CREATE A CHARTER

06:15:03.447 --> 06:15:05.015
SCHOOL IN A PLACES THAT FAR

06:15:05.082 --> 06:15:06.784
AWAY THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT

06:15:06.851 --> 06:15:08.886
AS CLOSE AS THEY CAN TO THE

06:15:08.953 --> 06:15:09.420
NEIGHBORHOOD IN WHICH THAT

06:15:09.486 --> 06:15:11.488
CHARTER COMMUNITY WAS BORN.

06:15:11.555 --> 06:15:12.556
WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR LIFEBLOOD

06:15:12.623 --> 06:15:14.525
WITH THEIR FRIENDS. AND AT AND

06:15:14.592 --> 06:15:16.927
THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE LIVING.

06:15:16.994 --> 06:15:19.163
THIS BILL WOULD TAKE THAT AWAY.

06:15:19.230 --> 06:15:23.267
YOU KNOW WHEN A. WHEN A PARENT

06:15:23.334 --> 06:15:25.102
MAKES THE CHOICE TO BE A PART

06:15:25.169 --> 06:15:26.470
OF IT A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOL

06:15:26.537 --> 06:15:28.339
NETWORK IT IS PROBABLY MAYBE

06:15:28.405 --> 06:15:30.140
THE MOST DIFFICULT CHOICES.

06:15:30.207 --> 06:15:30.741
THAT THEY MAKE IN THEIR LIVES

06:15:30.808 --> 06:15:33.944
WHY IS THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A

06:15:34.011 --> 06:15:34.545
COMPLETE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR

06:15:34.612 --> 06:15:38.015
LIFE. THEIR FRIENDS THERE'S

06:15:38.082 --> 06:15:38.983
THEIR CHILDREN'S FRIENDS ARE

06:15:39.049 --> 06:15:41.685
NEARBY AND THEY WANT TO PLAY

06:15:41.752 --> 06:15:42.253
TOGETHER THEY WANT TO GO TO

06:15:42.319 --> 06:15:42.887
SCHOOL TOGETHER THEY BREAK THAT

06:15:42.953 --> 06:15:46.056
UP. AND WHEN THEY HAVE TO GET

06:15:46.123 --> 06:15:47.024
UP EARLY IN THE MORNING AND

06:15:47.091 --> 06:15:49.159
COME HOME AT NIGHT. THEY'RE NOT

06:15:49.226 --> 06:15:49.793
GOING TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD

06:15:49.860 --> 06:15:51.161
SCHOOL THEY HAVE TO FIND A WAY

06:15:51.228 --> 06:15:52.863
TO GET TO THAT PLACE WHERE THAT

06:15:52.930 --> 06:15:54.398
CHARTER SCHOOLS BEEN FORMULATED

06:15:54.465 --> 06:15:55.833
BECAUSE THEY- THEY KNOW IT'S

06:15:55.900 --> 06:15:57.668
THE LIFE BLOOD FROM THEIR POINT

06:15:57.735 --> 06:15:58.168
OF VIEW FOR THEIR- THEIR

06:15:58.235 --> 06:16:00.404
CHILD'S FUTURE. AND THEY HAVE

06:16:00.471 --> 06:16:01.505
TO INCONVENIENCE THEIR WHOLE

06:16:01.572 --> 06:16:03.941
PROFESSIONAL LIFE OR WORK LIFE

06:16:04.008 --> 06:16:06.644
WHATEVER IT IS. TO MAKE THAT.

06:16:06.710 --> 06:16:07.912
ATTENDANCE AT THE CHARTER

06:16:07.978 --> 06:16:10.848
SCHOOL WORK. AND THEN WE HAVE A

06:16:10.915 --> 06:16:13.083
BILL LIKE THIS IT SAYS. NO NOW.

06:16:13.150 --> 06:16:14.385
WE'RE WE'RE NOT EVEN ALLOW THAT

06:16:14.451 --> 06:16:15.986
CHARTER SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S

06:16:16.053 --> 06:16:17.054
OUTSIDE THAT LINE THAT LITTLE

06:16:17.121 --> 06:16:19.556
LIGHT ON THE MAP. UNDER

06:16:19.623 --> 06:16:22.092
LEGISLATION LIKE THIS. AND SO

06:16:22.159 --> 06:16:24.295
MY FRIENDS. IT IS NOT. WHAT WE

06:16:24.361 --> 06:16:26.797
SHOULD BE DOING. IT IS NOT

06:16:26.864 --> 06:16:27.865
FOCUSING ON THE PROBLEMS OF

06:16:27.932 --> 06:16:29.867
EDUCATION IN OUR STATE. AS I

06:16:29.934 --> 06:16:33.304
DISCUSSED A FEW DAYS AGO OVER

06:16:33.370 --> 06:16:33.904
SEVEN HUNDRED FAILING SCHOOLS.

06:16:33.971 --> 06:16:36.840
TWENTY FIVE OF THEM. CHARTER

06:16:36.907 --> 06:16:38.909
PUBLIC CHARTERSCHOOLS DO I

06:16:38.976 --> 06:16:40.311
LIKE THAT NO I DON'T LIKE FEEL

06:16:40.377 --> 06:16:41.946
THE SCHOOLS ANYWHERE WHAT IT

06:16:42.012 --> 06:16:43.781
WHATEVER THEY ARE WE OUGHT TO

06:16:43.847 --> 06:16:46.083
WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE BOATS.

06:16:46.150 --> 06:16:48.585
BUT THIS THIS THIS LEGISLATION

06:16:48.652 --> 06:16:49.620
THAT SAYS A LINE ON THE MAP IS

06:16:49.687 --> 06:16:51.255
GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER

06:16:51.322 --> 06:16:52.423
FOR PUBLIC CHARTERS ISN'T THE

06:16:52.489 --> 06:16:54.224
SOLUTION IS NOT GOING TO HELP

06:16:54.291 --> 06:16:55.893
THEIR PET THAT THESE PARENTS

06:16:55.960 --> 06:16:57.761
YES. TENS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM

06:16:57.828 --> 06:16:59.697
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THE

06:16:59.763 --> 06:17:00.898
BUT NOW UTILIZED THE PUBLIC

06:17:00.965 --> 06:17:04.335
CHARTER SCHOOL NETWORK. AND

06:17:04.401 --> 06:17:04.935
WHEN THEY TOOK THEIR CHILDREN.

06:17:05.002 --> 06:17:06.637
TO BED TONIGHT. WHAT ARE THEY

06:17:06.704 --> 06:17:10.841
THINKING ABOUT. HELLO MY GET A

06:17:10.908 --> 06:17:12.643
GET MY KID READY IN THE MORNING

06:17:12.710 --> 06:17:13.711
HOW MY GONNA GET THEM TO THAT

06:17:13.777 --> 06:17:16.280
SCHOOL THE SAME THINGS THAT ALL

06:17:16.347 --> 06:17:17.214
PARENTS THINK ABOUT IT YET IF

06:17:17.281 --> 06:17:18.082
YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC CHARTER

06:17:18.148 --> 06:17:21.051
SCHOOL BELIEVE ME YOU'RE

06:17:21.118 --> 06:17:21.685
THINKING ABOUT IT TWICE AS HARD

06:17:21.752 --> 06:17:23.821
BECAUSE IT'S MORE INCONVENIENT.

06:17:23.887 --> 06:17:25.522
AND THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT

06:17:25.589 --> 06:17:26.023
THEY'RE MAKING SHOULD WE

06:17:26.090 --> 06:17:28.158
SUPPORT THAT CHOICE TODAY.

06:17:28.225 --> 06:17:30.627
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES

06:17:30.694 --> 06:17:31.061
NOT DO THAT AND SO I

06:17:31.128 --> 06:17:33.330
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE.

06:17:33.397 --> 06:17:35.733

COULD BE AS ELOQUENT. AS THE

06:17:45.843 --> 06:17:50.614
SENATOR FROM ARANDA BUT. AB

06:17:50.681 --> 06:17:51.148
FIFTY NO SEVEN FOCUSES ON

06:17:51.215 --> 06:17:54.451
BOUNDARIES. AND WE SHOULD BE

06:17:54.518 --> 06:17:57.054
FOCUSED ON STUDENTS AND WE

06:17:57.121 --> 06:17:58.856
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PARENTS

06:17:58.922 --> 06:18:00.958
WHO WANT THEIR KIDS TO SUCCEED.

06:18:01.025 --> 06:18:04.595
THE CURRENT SCHOOL. DISTRICT

06:18:04.661 --> 06:18:06.697
PARADIGM IS SINKING IN

06:18:06.764 --> 06:18:07.231
SACRAMENTO IS MOVING DECK

06:18:07.297 --> 06:18:13.537
FURNITURE. I URGE A NO VOTE ON

06:18:13.604 --> 06:18:14.104
A. B. FIFTEEN OH SEVEN THANK

06:18:14.171 --> 06:18:16.940
YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. BIGGEST

06:18:17.007 --> 06:18:20.144
ARE MORE LIKE CENTER BARGES. TO

06:18:20.210 --> 06:18:25.549
PRESENT. MY TENURE IN THE

06:18:25.616 --> 06:18:27.217
SENATE BEGAN AN INTEREST IN

06:18:27.284 --> 06:18:29.319
JANUARY SO FORGIVE ME IF I'M A

06:18:29.386 --> 06:18:30.554
LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY IN

06:18:30.621 --> 06:18:32.623
UNDERSTANDING HOW ALL OF

06:18:32.689 --> 06:18:35.993
SACRAMENTO IN THE SENATE WORKS.

06:18:36.060 --> 06:18:36.627
BUT I THINK WHAT REALLY COME OF

06:18:36.693 --> 06:18:39.763
WHAT. REALLY IS THE FUNDAMENTAL

06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:41.965
QUESTION IS DO YOU BELIEVE DO

06:18:42.032 --> 06:18:43.700
YOU BELIEVE THAT CHARTER

06:18:43.767 --> 06:18:44.268
SCHOOLS PROVIDE A WORTHWHILE

06:18:44.334 --> 06:18:48.672
SERVICE. OR DO YOU NOT. IT

06:18:48.739 --> 06:18:49.573
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PIECE OF

06:18:49.640 --> 06:18:51.275
LEGISLATION COMES THROUGH IT

06:18:51.341 --> 06:18:54.478
FALLS INTO TWO CAMPS. MOST OF

06:18:54.545 --> 06:18:56.213
LEGISLATION THAT WE SEE HAPPENS

06:18:56.280 --> 06:18:59.483
TO BEING IN THE LATTER. AND

06:18:59.550 --> 06:19:02.119
IT'S JUST A SYSTEMATIC

06:19:02.186 --> 06:19:03.720
DELIBERATE DISMANTLING OF THE

06:19:03.787 --> 06:19:07.224
CHARTER SYSTEM. LEGISLATION BY

06:19:07.291 --> 06:19:09.259
LEGISLATION ISSUE BY ISSUE

06:19:09.326 --> 06:19:11.662
CHIPPING AWAY WHEN ULTIMATELY

06:19:11.728 --> 06:19:12.296
THE ISSUE IS WE JUST DON'T LIKE

06:19:12.362 --> 06:19:13.464
CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THAT I

06:19:13.530 --> 06:19:18.035
THINK. IS UNFORTUNATE I'M NOT

06:19:18.102 --> 06:19:19.503
GONNA GET INTO THE MERITS ON

06:19:19.570 --> 06:19:22.106
THIS I THINK THEY'VE BEEN

06:19:22.172 --> 06:19:26.710
DISCUSSED BY EARLIER. COMMENTS

06:19:26.777 --> 06:19:29.513
I JUST THINK IT'S SAD WHEN YOU

06:19:29.580 --> 06:19:30.013
HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

06:19:30.080 --> 06:19:33.684
CHILDREN TO LEARN. AND YOUR

06:19:33.750 --> 06:19:35.052
TAKING AWAY THAT OPPORTUNITY IN

06:19:35.119 --> 06:19:37.221
FORCING THEM. ONTO A DIFFERENT

06:19:37.287 --> 06:19:40.491
PATH WHEN TO CAN SIMULTANEOUSLY

06:19:40.557 --> 06:19:43.627
EXIST. AND PERFORM WELL THIS IS

06:19:43.694 --> 06:19:45.496
NOT A WIN LOSE SITUATION OR AN

06:19:45.562 --> 06:19:48.866
EITHER OR WAR. THEY CAN COEXIST

06:19:48.932 --> 06:19:50.567
CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN THRIVE CO

06:19:50.634 --> 06:19:52.736
EXIST WITH THRIVING TRADITIONAL

06:19:52.803 --> 06:19:56.740
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I THINK WE NEED

06:19:56.807 --> 06:19:58.909
TO RE EVALUATE OUR THESE

06:19:58.976 --> 06:20:01.945
CHARTER ISSUES NOT JUST ONCE IN

06:20:02.012 --> 06:20:02.546
THE SESSION BUT THE ONES THAT

06:20:02.613 --> 06:20:03.113
WILL PROBABLY COME UP IN THE

06:20:03.180 --> 06:20:05.616
NEXT SESSION. WE CAN FIND PASS

06:20:05.682 --> 06:20:07.784
FORWARD FOR THEM TO CO EXIST.

06:20:07.851 --> 06:20:10.354
AND BE MEANINGFUL INSTITUTIONS

06:20:10.420 --> 06:20:12.256
IN OUR COMMUNITIES I JUST DON'T

06:20:12.322 --> 06:20:13.624
THINK WERE. BEING HONEST WITH

06:20:13.690 --> 06:20:16.360
OURSELVES IF WE ARE LOOKING AT

06:20:16.426 --> 06:20:17.294
THIS LEGISLATION BY

06:20:17.361 --> 06:20:19.997
LEGISLATION. NOT FIXING A

06:20:20.063 --> 06:20:20.631
PROBLEM ITS DISMANTLING CHARTER

06:20:20.697 --> 06:20:24.501
SYSTEMS. THANK YOU CENTER BOARD

06:20:24.568 --> 06:20:32.476
JUST SENATOR FELL. WELL AFTER

06:20:32.543 --> 06:20:33.644
THIRTEEN YEARS HERE AND TWENTY

06:20:33.710 --> 06:20:35.479
SIX YEARS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

06:20:35.546 --> 06:20:36.046
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

06:20:36.113 --> 06:20:40.317
THAT WE HAVE. LEGISLATION THAT

06:20:40.384 --> 06:20:43.086
REALLY CLARIFIES RELATIONSHIP

06:20:43.153 --> 06:20:47.524
IF. I'M GONNA TRY TO TAKE YOUR

06:20:47.591 --> 06:20:49.126
CHEESE AWAY OR IF YOU'RE GOING

06:20:49.193 --> 06:20:51.428
TO TRY TO TAKE MY CHEESE AWAY

06:20:51.495 --> 06:20:53.096
SO THIS RELATIONSHIP INTER

06:20:53.163 --> 06:20:54.164
GOVERNMENTAL RELIGION SHOULD BE

06:20:54.231 --> 06:20:58.702
ISSUE IS REALLY UNIMPORTANT

06:20:58.769 --> 06:20:59.269
IMPORTANT THING AND I AND I

06:20:59.336 --> 06:21:02.339
STAND FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE I

06:21:02.406 --> 06:21:03.774
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ESTABLISH

06:21:03.840 --> 06:21:04.641
THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:06.543
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO HAVE THAT

06:21:06.610 --> 06:21:09.913
UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE ONE

06:21:09.980 --> 06:21:13.350
THAT HAS THE SITE. HOUSE TO

06:21:13.417 --> 06:21:14.952
HAVE THE VOTERS IN THAT

06:21:15.018 --> 06:21:18.021
DISTRICT. BE THE PREDOMINANT

06:21:18.088 --> 06:21:20.524
DECISION MAKING BODY. THE

06:21:20.591 --> 06:21:21.091
PREDOMINANT DECISION MAKING

06:21:21.158 --> 06:21:23.560
BODY. WITH COOPERATION WITH THE

06:21:23.627 --> 06:21:28.565
OTHER. SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

06:21:28.632 --> 06:21:29.600
WORKING WITH THOSE SCHOOL THIS

06:21:29.666 --> 06:21:31.301
IS THE AND THE CHARTER SCHOOLS

06:21:31.368 --> 06:21:33.604
BUT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR A

06:21:33.670 --> 06:21:36.373
FAIR THING BECAUSE WE DID PASS.

06:21:36.440 --> 06:21:37.975
THE LAW. THAT'S A COMPANION

06:21:38.041 --> 06:21:41.111
BILL SAYING THAT. WE WENT TO

06:21:41.178 --> 06:21:44.214
SCHOOL BOARD FROM THAT AREA. TO

06:21:44.281 --> 06:21:47.751
HAVE THE FISCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

06:21:47.818 --> 06:21:49.353
AND THEY THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

06:21:49.419 --> 06:21:52.689
DETERMINING THE IMPACT. ON ALL

06:21:52.756 --> 06:21:55.359
THE STUDENTS IN THAT DISTRICT

06:21:55.425 --> 06:21:57.527
WHAT IS THE ACADEMIC IMPACT

06:21:57.594 --> 06:21:59.563
WHAT IS THE FISCAL IMPACT NOT

06:21:59.630 --> 06:22:01.064
JUST FOR THE CHURCH START

06:22:01.131 --> 06:22:03.066
CHARTER SCHOOL KIDS BUT FOR ALL

06:22:03.133 --> 06:22:05.702
THE KIDS. IN THE DISTRICT. HOW

06:22:05.769 --> 06:22:07.037
DOES IT IMPACT YOUR THOSE KIDS

06:22:07.104 --> 06:22:10.607

EDUCATION OF THOSE ARE ISSUES

06:22:14.444 --> 06:22:15.579
THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

06:22:15.646 --> 06:22:18.849
SO I THINK THIS BILL HELPS

06:22:18.915 --> 06:22:19.383
FACILITATE THOSE KINDS OF

06:22:19.449 --> 06:22:22.886
RELATIONSHIPS. THAT THOSE KIND

06:22:22.953 --> 06:22:23.487
OF RELATIONSHIPS ARE GOING TO

HELP THE STUDENTS NOT HURT. SO.

06:22:28.025 --> 06:22:30.127
SOMETIMES ANOTHER ANALOGY MIGHT

BE IMPORTANT. AND WHAT IF SANTA

06:22:58.255 --> 06:22:59.656
ILLOGICAL SAYING THAT'S WHY YOU
