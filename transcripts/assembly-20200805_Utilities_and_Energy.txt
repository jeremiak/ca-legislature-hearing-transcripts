ARC AND WITH THE BILL EXISTS WITH THE STATE COMPELLING DIG ALERT WHICH IS AN UNREGULATED NON PROFIT MUTUAL BENEFIT CORPORATION. TO RELINQUISH ITS NOTIFICATION TICKETS TO THE STATE. INSTEAD WE BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REQUIRE THE STATE TO WORK COOPERATIVELY AND PARTNER WITH DICK ALERT. LAST YEAR DICK FIELDED EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CONTACTS FOR SERVICE. THOSE SERVICE REQUESTS GENERATED ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION THAT UTILITY AND NOTIFICATION TICKETS. PRESUMABLY THE DATA FROM THOSE EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION ANNUAL TICKETS WILL BE USED TO FORM EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT STRATEGIES AT THE DIG SAFE PORT. BUT ACCORDING THE DIG SAFE BOARDS TWENTY NINETEEN LEGISLATIVE REVIEW. THERE ARE ONLY FIVE INVESTIGATORS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION. THOSE FIVE INVEST CREATORS WOULD HAVE TO REVIEW. SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE TICKETS PER DAY. TO REVIEW ALL EIGHT AND A HALF MILLION TICKETS IN A YEAR. WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERING AMENDMENTS THAT ENCOURAGES A COOPERATIVE AND PARTNERING APPROACH INSTEAD OF THE MANDATE CONTAINED IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE.
