CALIFORNIA IS AT A CRITICAL

00:07:22.208 --> 00:07:24.110
ENVIRONMENTAL CROSSROADS. THIS

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.145
YEAR ALONE WILDFIRES DROUGHT

RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.161
START BY SAYING THAT CALIFORNIA

00:07:42.228 --> 00:07:44.030
HAS LONG LED THE NATION IN

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.131
PROGRESSIVE RECYCLING WASTE

LOTS AND WE'VE MADE INCREDIBLE

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:48.467
PROGRESS. AND A CONVERSATION

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:49.569
JUST THIS MORNING WITH A MEMBER

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.237
OF THIS COMMITTEE. WE TALKED

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.673
ABOUT A LANDFILL THAT WAS DUE

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:55.675
TO REACH CAPACITY AND CLOSE IN

00:07:55.741 --> 00:07:57.143
TWO THOUSAND ONE. BUT NOW IS

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.378
NOWHERE NEAR THAT FULL CAPACITY

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:01.280
AND THAT IS INCREDIBLE PROGRESS

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:07.353
HOWEVER THERE IS ALSO. MUCH

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:08.020
MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:08.688
IN THIS COUNTRY NEAR 4% OF THE

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.157
FOOD PRODUCED NOT EATEN. BUT

00:08:11.224 --> 00:08:11.757
RATHER ENDS UP IN OUR

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:15.828
LANDFILLS. TURNING INTO METHANE

00:08:15.895 --> 00:08:18.164
EIGHTY FOUR TIMES MORE POTENT.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:20.700
THAN CARBON. ORGANIC WASTE

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:22.235
INCLUDING FOOD ACCOUNTS FOR

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.703
NEARLY HALF OF WHAT WE DISPOSE

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.872
OF HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:26.873
MOST RECENT NUMBERS SHOW THAT

00:08:26.939 --> 00:08:29.408
CALIFORNIA THREW AWAY TWENTY

00:08:29.475 --> 00:08:31.077
SEVEN MILLION TONS OF ORGANIC

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:34.280
WASTE. IN TWO THOUSAND

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.848

WAS PLASTICS THAT'S OVER FOUR

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.487
MILLION TIMES IN A SINGLE YEAR.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:45.024
WE ARE DIVERTING AND RECYCLING

00:08:45.091 --> 00:08:47.727
37% OF OUR RESTRAINT. WE SIMPLY

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:49.562
NEED TO DO BETTER AND MUCH MUCH

00:08:49.629 --> 00:08:52.565
BETTER. I BELIEVE IS A STATE WE

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:54.367
ARE WELL POISED TO NOT ONLY DO

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:56.736
BETTER REDUCE OUR WASTE AND

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:57.403
LESSEN OUR IMPACT ON THE

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.639
ENVIRONMENT. BUT TO TURN OUR

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:02.508
WASTE INTO A RESOURCE AND USE

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.577
IT TO RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:06.846

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:10.229
LEGISLATURE HAS SUPPORTED SOME

00:12:10.296 --> 00:12:12.965

THINK THIS IS A REAL.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.972
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA AND

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.112
WAYS WHERE WE CAN BREAK THE

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:28.013
LOGJAM ON AND SOME OF THE

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.982

00:12:41.127 --> 00:12:42.695
PANDEMIC SLOWED EVERYTHING DOWN

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:44.330
AND SAY OH I THINK WE NOW HAVE

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:46.665

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:18.624
THE KIDS AT SCHOOL OUR CHILDREN

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:20.526
WERE WERE BEING EDUCATED ON THE

00:14:20.593 --> 00:14:21.860
IMPORTANCE OF THIS BRING THAT

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.796
HOME IT GAROFALO VERY INVOLVED

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:26.198
TOO SO. GOOD PROGRAM ARE ONE

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.067
OTHER QUICK QUESTION. THE COST

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.702
OF DOING BUSINESS HAS REALLY

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.403
AREN'T I THINK. I DAHLE THE

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.372
MOLE THE MARKET OR THE IN THE

00:14:33.439 --> 00:14:35.474
INTEREST OF BUSINESSES WANTING

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:37.610
TO INCREASE RECYCLING-

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.478
MARKETING CALIFORNIA ARE YOU

00:14:39.545 --> 00:14:41.513
TAKING A LOOK AT HOW WE MIGHT.

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.349
RE OFFEND TO VICE- OUR

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:45.417
BUSINESSES WASN'T HE I'M TRYING

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:46.452
TO MEMBER THAN THE NAME OF THE

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:48.787
BUSINESS THAT WAS REALLY AT THE

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.789
HEADWATERS AND THEY QUIT DOING

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.958
BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE CAR OFF

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.194
TÁI IT WAS. ACTUALLY ON MORE

00:14:55.261 --> 00:14:57.396
EXPENSIVE TO DO TO DO WITH. THE

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:59.632
RECYCLING ALL PROGRAMS FAN ARE

00:14:59.698 --> 00:15:00.666
WHAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.368
RECEIVING IN TERMS OF

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:04.103
REMUNERATION SO IF YOU CAN DIE

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:05.571
SHARE SOME THOUGHT SHE MIGHT.

00:15:05.638 --> 00:15:07.306
BE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE I THINK

00:15:07.373 --> 00:15:08.507
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:14.213

ABOUT AND- IN THE PAST.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:06.031
OFTENTIMES THE BIGGEST HURDLE

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.433
INTO STARTING A BUSINESS IS

00:16:07.499 --> 00:16:09.001

LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK IT'S A

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.225
VERY VERY EXCITING AREA WHERE

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:37.763
THERE IS MARKED IMPROVEMENT. TO

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:38.364
BE MADE BUT MARKED IMPROVEMENT

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:38.964

PLANS WITHOUT I THINK THE

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.169

LANDFILLS YOU WERE REFERRING

00:17:39.391 --> 00:17:42.194
TO. US OUT OF OUR DISCUSSION

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.630
BUT IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:45.731
BECAUSE WHEN I WENT ON THE CITY

00:17:45.798 --> 00:17:48.967
COUNCIL ALMOST EIGHT EIGHTY

00:17:49.034 --> 00:17:50.068
FORTY YEARS AGO IT SEEMS LIKE

00:17:50.135 --> 00:17:51.970
EIGHTY ALMOST FORTY YEARS AGO

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:54.406

NOW FORTY YEARS LATER THE

00:18:04.383 --> 00:18:05.851
LANDFILL THAT HAD TWENTY YEARS

00:18:05.918 --> 00:18:07.786
LIFE ON IT HAS THIRTY THREE

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:08.520
YEARS LIFE ON IT AND THE

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:10.823
REASON. THAT IT'S GONE THAT WAY

00:18:10.889 --> 00:18:12.224
AND HAS EXPANDED LARGEST

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:14.393
PROGRAM YOU ARE ADMINISTERING

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:16.361
BUT THEN IT RAISES QUESTIONS

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.363
AND ONE OF THEM WE TALKED ABOUT

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.566
TODAY. IS THE BILL THAT THAT

00:18:20.632 --> 00:18:22.334
SENATOR BATES REFERRED TO THAT

00:18:22.401 --> 00:18:27.573
WAS PASSED IN IT IN THE LATE.

00:18:27.639 --> 00:18:29.775
DROWNED OUT. TRYING DOWNTURN

00:18:29.842 --> 00:18:34.813
THIS OFF. IT HAPPENED DOT ORG

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.381
OUR CAUCUS RETREAT AND IT WAS

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.716
JERRY BROWN AND EVERYBODY WAS

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:39.418
SITTING AROUND ME IN A PLACE

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:41.753
THAT'S OKAY HE CALLED THE REST

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.321
OF US AFTER YOU DIDN'T HEAR.

00:18:42.387 --> 00:18:45.891
EXACTLY. AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.994
ABOUT OF EACH. AND SO THE THING

00:18:49.061 --> 00:18:51.630
ABOUT IT IS THE TIP FEE THAT

00:18:51.697 --> 00:18:56.235
WAS IN THAT INITIAL BILL FUNDED

00:18:56.301 --> 00:18:59.071
DIVERSION RATE THE- TO CHANGE

00:18:59.137 --> 00:19:02.941
SO DRAMATICALLY AND SUCCESS ARE

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:04.943
COMES WITH LOSING YOUR FUNDING

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:05.777
SOURCE THE MORE YOU'RE

00:19:05.844 --> 00:19:07.412
SUCCESSFUL THE LAST FUNDING YOU

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:08.680
CASH BECAUSE IT CAME FROM THE

00:19:08.747 --> 00:19:10.349
TIP FEE TO FUND SO

00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:12.684
NOW THAT YOU'RE INCREDIBLY

00:19:12.751 --> 00:19:14.953
SUCCESSFUL YOU DON'T HAVE- OF.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.389
THAT TO DO OUR PART HOW ARE YOU

GOING TO DEAL WITH OUT OVER

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.192
TIME. AND IF YOU WANT TO

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:21.293
DIPLOMATICALLY SAY THE

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.330
LEGISLATURE COULD HELP US I'M.

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.299
HOW YOU GOING TO DEAL WITH THEM.

00:19:27.366 --> 00:19:29.935
YEAH YOU READ MY MIND SENATOR

00:19:30.002 --> 00:19:31.403
LARRY AS A GOOD FORMER

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.705
LEGISLATIVE STAFFER I KNOW TO

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:35.207
NEVER STEP INTO THE WORLD OF

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:37.075
APPROPRIATIONS SPREAD OUT I

00:19:37.142 --> 00:19:38.877
HAVE WITH OUT FULL BACK UP OF

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:41.680
MY- OF THE LEGISLATURE AND BUT

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:42.948
I THINK YOU KNOW AS WE

00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:44.550
DISCUSSED THIS MORNING THIS IS

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:47.686
A HUGE CHALLENGE THAT. AND YOU

00:19:47.753 --> 00:19:49.388
KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO WORK OUR

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:52.157
CYCLE AND ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:53.625
ASSIGNED TO BE PUT OUT OF

00:19:53.692 --> 00:19:55.027
BUSINESS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:19:55.093 --> 00:19:56.628
ANY WASTE BUT THE PROBLEM IS

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.597
THAT THERE'S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:01.033
AS PROGRAMS THAT HELP. BUILD

00:20:01.099 --> 00:20:02.734
AND MAINTAIN COMPOSTING

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:05.337
FACILITIES RECYCLING FACILITIES

00:20:05.404 --> 00:20:07.172
AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EFFORTS

00:20:07.239 --> 00:20:10.108
THOSE ARE I'M PRIMARILY FUNDED

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:14.179
AND RUN THE AND THAT THE TIPSY

00:20:14.246 --> 00:20:17.215
SIGNED BINDING AND SO I THINK

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:18.750
THAT IT IS SOMETHING IN THERE

00:20:18.817 --> 00:20:20.652
UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW THAT

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:22.554
FUND IS VERY HEALTHY THIS WAS A

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.591
VERY HIGH DISPOSAL YEAR AS- WE

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.694
HONOR- AND KEVIN WOULD BRING.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.029
AND BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:20:31.096 --> 00:20:34.132
AND HOPEFULLY AT AND I THINK

00:20:34.199 --> 00:20:37.002
AND AUSPICIOUSLY WILL DECREASE

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:38.604
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE COMING

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.172
YEARS AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:41.807
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE

00:20:41.873 --> 00:20:43.208
CONTINUE TO FIND THAT ANY

00:20:43.275 --> 00:20:45.043
EFFORTS THAT ARE HELPING OUR

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:46.345
ENVIRONMENT AND HELPING OUR

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:49.147
COMMUNITIES I'M AND- WHILE AT

00:20:49.214 --> 00:20:50.315
THE SAME TIME INTENSELY

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:55.954
DECREASING AT. THE EIGHT NOW

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:56.521
THEY WERE DISPOSING UP. AND

00:20:56.588 --> 00:20:57.623
THEN I I'VE APPRECIATE AND IT'S

00:20:57.689 --> 00:20:59.925
THAT WILL WORK ON THAT. ANOTHER

00:20:59.992 --> 00:21:01.560
THING WE TALKED ABOUT AND I WAS

00:21:01.627 --> 00:21:03.562
DISAPPOINTED TO HEAR BECAUSE I

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:04.896
WAS ON THE WAY SUPPORT FOR A

00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:06.164
YEAR AND WHEN I WAS ON THE

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.100
WHITE BOARD WITH OUR PLASTIC

00:21:08.166 --> 00:21:10.969
RECYCLING. WE WERE REALLY GOOD

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:12.738
AT TAKING THE PLASTIC INTO THE

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.106
RECYCLING AND WE HAD

00:21:14.172 --> 00:21:16.942
MANUFACTURERS THAT WANTED TO

00:21:17.009 --> 00:21:18.910
USE THE PALLETS AND REUSE IT.

00:21:18.977 --> 00:21:20.412
BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THE PEOPLE

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:22.614
IN BETWEEN TO MANUFACTURE THE

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:24.783
RECYCLING TO THE BALANCE. AND

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.652
THEN IN THE CIRCULAR PART OF IT

00:21:26.718 --> 00:21:27.786
WE WERE MISSING THE MIDDLE

00:21:27.853 --> 00:21:31.089
PART. ARM IS THAT STILL A

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.658
PROBLEM AND IF THAT'S STILL A

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:35.661
PROBLEM HOW DO YOU SUGGEST WE

THAT QUESTION SENATOR LARRY

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.567
THAT IS DISTINCTLY THE PROBLEM

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:46.104
THAT AND I CAME ON BOARD. AND

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:48.206
TO ADDRESS UNFORTUNATELY EVERY

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.242
TEN YEARS WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:52.477
MAGIC BULLET THAT WILL. WILL

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:55.347
ADDRESS THAT SITUATION I'M SO

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.982
EITHER IN MY TIME IN THE

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.618
LEGISLATURE. I AND AS A

00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:01.053
COMMITTEE CONSULTANT I COULD

00:22:01.119 --> 00:22:02.387
SEE THAT THERE WERE GAPS THAT

00:22:02.454 --> 00:22:03.755
EXISTED IN OUR SYSTEM BUT I

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:04.923
COULDN'T QUITE FIGURE OUT WHERE

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.491
THEY WERE AND STILL COMING ON

00:22:06.558 --> 00:22:07.926
BOARD AS DIRECTOR SIX MONTHS

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.328
AGO MY TOP ONE OF MY TOP GOALS.

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:12.964
AND AS MANY ONE OF MY DOUBLES

00:22:13.031 --> 00:22:14.399
WAS IDENTIFIED THE SPECIFIC

00:22:14.466 --> 00:22:17.135
APPS. AND AS AND YOU ALL KNOW

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:18.303
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.938
WERE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:21.073
FOR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THOSE

00:22:21.139 --> 00:22:23.709
WERE VERY MUCH MEANT. TO START

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:24.943
TO ADDRESS TO LAY THE

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:26.445
FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.580
THOSE GAPS. IN RECYCLING AND

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.115
CREATING THIS THE TRUE

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:33.218
CIRCULARITY AND- AN EXAMPLE OF

00:22:33.285 --> 00:22:36.354
THIS IS AND HE BURKE HOLDING.

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:39.357
I'M IN CALIFORNIA WE CREATE A

00:22:39.424 --> 00:22:41.760
LOT OF CYBER. THAT WOULD BE

00:22:41.827 --> 00:22:43.962
GREAT IF WE COULD GET RECYCLED

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.565
AND WE ALSO HAVE AND SOME

00:22:46.631 --> 00:22:48.400
REMANUFACTURING HERE AS

00:22:48.467 --> 00:22:50.202
RECYCLED FIBER THAT HAPPENS IN

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:51.536
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:53.305
WE'RE NOT DOING IS ACTUALLY

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:54.873
RECYCLING FIBER AND THE STATE

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:56.174
OF CALIFORNIA LOST OUT ON

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:58.210
SEVERAL COMPANIES. AND THAT

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:00.045
WE'RE LOOKING AT CALIFORNIA

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:02.047
BECAUSE THE FEEDSTOCK WAS HERE.

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.982
AND THEN ENDED UP GOING TO

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.451
OTHER STATES AND THAT JUST MADE

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:07.586
MORE BUSINESS SENSE FOR THEM

00:23:07.652 --> 00:23:09.788
SO. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AND

00:23:09.855 --> 00:23:11.223
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.758
BUILD PROGRAMS THAT DRAW THOSE

00:23:12.824 --> 00:23:14.292
COMPANIES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.160
SEE HERE IN THE STATE OF

00:23:15.227 --> 00:23:16.528
CALIFORNIA THAT ARE RECYCLING

00:23:16.595 --> 00:23:17.629
THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.765
TO RECYCLE. AND PROVIDING THE

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:22.367
ECONOMIC BENEFITS UNITIES I'M

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.002
THE JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THE WAY

00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.470
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM BUILT

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:27.539
AND BUILDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.741
AND REALLY. LAID THE GROUNDWORK

00:23:29.808 --> 00:23:32.043
AND DEFINITION OF WHAT A TRUE

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.812
CIRCULAR ECONOMY IS WHICH IS

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:39.117
NOT JUST RECYCLING. RECYCLING

00:23:39.184 --> 00:23:40.118
IN A WAY THAT THEN SETS THE

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:42.053
COMMUTER AND THE- AND THEN. WE

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:42.921
TALK A LITTLE BIT TODAY WHAT'S

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:44.623
STATUS OF TIRE RECYCLING AT

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:47.859
THIS. I DIDN'T GET THAT NUMBER

00:23:47.926 --> 00:23:51.997
SENATORS THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

00:23:52.063 --> 00:23:54.166
I HAVE IT RIGHT HERE HE ASKED

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:56.034
ME FOR HOW MUCH WE RECYCLE AND

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.269
I DIDN'T HAVE T OFF THE TOP OF

00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:58.036
MY HEAD WHICH I WAS A LITTLE

00:23:58.103 --> 00:23:59.204
EMBARRASSED ABOUT BECAUSE I

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.873
LITERALLY HAD READ OUR AND

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:03.175
DRAFT HIGHER PLANNED. TWO DAYS

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:08.079
AGO. I'M THAT I'M TOLD. IS AND-

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.081
GENERATING FIVE HUNDRED

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:13.451
EIGHTEEN. JUST OVER FIVE

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:14.452
HUNDRED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TONS.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:17.355
OF TIRES- WE ARE DIVERTING

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:20.258
ABOUT EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. I'M

00:24:20.325 --> 00:24:22.093
FROM LANDFILLS IN TWENTY

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:24.129
NINETEEN THAT WAS DOWN FROM 92%

00:24:24.196 --> 00:24:26.565
WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE. AND YOU

00:24:26.631 --> 00:24:29.034
KNOW IN TERMS OF RECYCLING. AND

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.002
WE'RE RECYCLING ABOUT THIRTY

00:24:31.069 --> 00:24:33.839
SEVEN PERCENT. AND I WILL STATE

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:36.474
THAT THE SILVER LINING. WELL

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.909
FIRST I'D LIKE TO SAY I'D LIKE

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:40.111
TO BE DOING A LOT BETTER. AND

00:24:40.178 --> 00:24:42.247
TIRES HOWEVER AS YOU KNOW ARE

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:44.349
VERY CHALLENGING MATERIAL. I'M

00:24:44.416 --> 00:24:46.151
AND BY BETTER I WANT TO DO IT

00:24:46.218 --> 00:24:47.319
IN A WAY THAT IS

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:49.588
ENVIRONMENTALLY HELPFUL AND- IS

00:24:49.654 --> 00:24:52.290
NOT PERPETUATING AT PRACTICES

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.124
THAT AREN'T GOOD FOR THE

00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:55.460
ENVIRONMENT. BUT I WILL SEE THE

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:57.128
SILVER LINING IS THAT THIS

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:59.097
PROGRAM HAS SPENT INCREDIBLY

00:24:59.164 --> 00:25:02.334
SUCCESSFUL. AND IN DIVERTING

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:05.103
FROM LANDFILLS. AND CUTTING WAY

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.072
BACK AND- THEY ILLEGAL DISPOSAL

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:10.041
OF TIRES. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:11.109
IN THE CREATION OF THIS

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.144
PROGRAM. WAS CUTTING WAY BACK

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:16.348
ON THAT AND NUMBER OF. FIRES

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:19.251
I'M FROM STOCKPILED TYRES. AND

00:25:19.317 --> 00:25:21.586
WE HAVE NOT YET. AND WHEN SHE

00:25:21.653 --> 00:25:22.921
SAYS BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN A

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.389
FIRE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

00:25:24.456 --> 00:25:26.625
TRACY FIRE. I'M SINCE THE INS

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:27.626
AND COMMENCEMENT OF THIS

00:25:27.692 --> 00:25:29.294
PROGRAM. AND SO I'LL TAKE THAT

00:25:29.361 --> 00:25:31.263
AS A HUGE SUCCESS BUT UCH MORE

00:25:31.329 --> 00:25:33.098
WORK TO BE DONE. NUMBER AND-

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:34.532
WHAT WENT HERE WE TALK ABOUT

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.401
TIRES AND WE'RE RECYCLING AND

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:38.069
ONE SILO AND- WE HAVE

00:25:38.136 --> 00:25:40.906
ELECTRONICS THAT WE RECYCLE. IN

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:43.975
A SILO. OR HAVE EXTENDED

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:44.910
PRODUCER OF PRODUCER

RESPONSIBILITY SILO. HOW DO WE

00:25:47.345 --> 00:25:48.513
MOVE TO EXTENDED PRODUCER

00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.181
RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S ACROSS

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:58.023
THE BOARD IT JUST NOT IN SILOS.

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:58.623
OR OR LET'S JUST SAY BROADER.

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.224
THAT RATHER THAN A CAR THE HOW

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.191
DO WE DEAL WITH WHOLE ISSUE

INCREDIBLY. MILLION DOLLAR

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:06.031
QUESTION FOR ME AND I THINK

00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:07.832
THAT IS WHY WE REALLY WANT TO

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:09.067
START THE CONVERSATION WITH THE

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.735
LEGISLATURE ON HOW DO WE BUILD

00:26:10.802 --> 00:26:12.103
A CIRCULARECONOMY A TRUE

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.472
CIRCULAR ECONOMY. WE REALLY

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.074
NEED TO MAKE IT TO A PLACE

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:16.808
WHERE MANUFACTURERS ARE

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:18.543
DESIGNING. ALL OF THEIR

00:26:18.610 --> 00:26:20.779
PRODUCTS OR THEIR NEXT LIFE AND

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:23.048
THAT WE ARE NOT DOING AS I LIKE

00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:24.482
TO REFER AT THE LACK OF MORAL

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:26.785
AND TRYING TO RECYCLE THINGS

00:26:26.851 --> 00:26:27.352
THAT WERE DESIGNED FOR

00:26:27.419 --> 00:26:30.388
DISPOSAL. I'M WE AS YOU KNOW

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.257
HAS FOUR OR FIVE DEPENDING ON

00:26:32.324 --> 00:26:33.758
HOW YOU JUST DEFINE IT PRODUCT

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:35.493
STEWARDSHIP U. P. R. PROGRAMS

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.262
IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MAKING

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:39.064
INCREDIBLE PROGRESS WHAT WE

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.900
NEED TO BE DOING. AS A STATE IS

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:43.034
WORKING WITH THOSE

00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:44.536
MANUFACTURERS IN STATE AND OUT

00:26:44.602 --> 00:26:46.071
OF STATE AND REALLY DEMANDING

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:47.605
THAT THEIR PRODUCTS ARE

00:26:47.672 --> 00:26:51.042
DESIGNED. FOR THEIR NEXT LIFE

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.577
AND THE LIFE AFTER THAT. AN ARM

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:53.545
GOING TO TAKE THAT AS AN OPEN

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:55.814
INVITATION TO WORK TOGETHER ON

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.048
THAT SO THAT'S GREAT. IN THE

00:26:57.115 --> 00:26:59.484
WEEKS. AND THEN THE LAST

00:26:59.551 --> 00:27:02.887
QUESTION. IS ON ORGANICS WHICH

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:05.323
IS BEEN CENTRAL TO SOME OF THE

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.092
THINGS YOU'VE BEEN DOING

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:07.659
THERE'S A BILL THAT'S BEING

00:27:07.726 --> 00:27:09.928
IMPLEMENTED. I KNOW I'M DOING A

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:11.296

BE PENALIZED FOR THIS YEAR. AND

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.870
THE LEGISLATURE HAS PUT A

00:27:18.937 --> 00:27:20.372
PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:22.073

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:22.367
CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON WHAT

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:24.602
THEY NEED TO CUT OR COMPLIANCE

00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:26.905
AND I THINK THAT MANY THAT THE-

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:28.673
LEGISLATURE SPENT PORRIDGE.

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:30.375
THAT AND IS A POTENTIAL

00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:32.077
INFUSION IN HELPING THEM BUILD

00:28:32.143 --> 00:28:33.478
THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND LAYING

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:34.779
THE GROUNDWORK FOR THAT

00:28:34.846 --> 00:28:38.183
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FOR THE

00:28:38.249 --> 00:28:39.684
APPROPRIATE MANAGEMENT AND

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.586
RECYCLING AND NOT WASTE THERE

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.822
IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME I

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.658
THINK IT REALLY WELL ONCE AND

00:28:46.724 --> 00:28:49.861
COMPLIANCE AND IMPLEMENTATION

00:28:49.928 --> 00:28:52.630
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SERRA. AND

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:54.299
WE REALLY SEE OUR ROLE AS

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:56.768
HELPING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.369
COME INTO COMPLIANCE AS YOU

00:28:58.436 --> 00:29:00.171

00:29:00.238 --> 00:29:03.408
STATE WIDE REQUIREMENT OF 75%

00:29:03.475 --> 00:29:05.443

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.749
AND UNFORTUNATELY AND WHILE WE

00:29:11.816 --> 00:29:14.352
ARE DISPOSING OF MORE THAN OUR

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:16.387
BASELINE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN SO

WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:19.257
BUT I THINK THE INFUSION OF

00:29:19.324 --> 00:29:21.126
DOLLARS AND THE TOOLS THAT CAL

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:23.862

ABLE TO SKETCH YESTERDAY. BUT I

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:15.947
KNOW THAT THE REGULATORY

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.282
PROCESS OF THE MANDATES THAT

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:18.383
FELL ON PRIVATE BUSINESS

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:20.652
INDUSTRY AND RECYCLERS. CREATED

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:22.954
A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.255
A ROBUST RECYCLING PROGRAM

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:28.393
THAT- AS- ADDRESSES CURBSIDE

00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:31.262
PICKUP AND- TAKING THE NUMBERS

00:30:31.329 --> 00:30:33.865
TO SEPARATE AND RECYCLE. AND SO

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:34.666
I KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF

00:30:34.732 --> 00:30:35.333
BILLS GOING THROUGH THE

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.235
BUILDING- AND I KNOW EVERYBODY

00:30:37.302 --> 00:30:39.404
HAS THEIR OWN REPRESENTATION OF

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.138
THEIR OWN DISTRICT AND I

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:42.240
RESPECT THAT. BUT I DO HAVE A

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:44.409
CONCERN ABOUT THAT SO WAS

00:30:44.475 --> 00:30:47.745
CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS

00:30:47.812 --> 00:30:48.279
ABOUT CURBSIDE PICKUP AND

00:30:48.346 --> 00:30:53.351
IMMERSE. STOP ME IF I'M GOING

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:54.686
IN THE WRONG DIRECTION SENATOR

00:30:54.752 --> 00:30:56.955
AT MAKE SURE I'M I'M I'M

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:57.789
UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY IN

00:30:57.855 --> 00:30:59.824
TERMS OF. WHERE I'M AT

00:30:59.891 --> 00:31:02.327
DEPARTMENT AND MY PERSONAL AND

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:04.262
AS THE DIRECTOR RELATIONSHIP

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:05.964
WITH THE CURBSIDE PICKUP AND

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:08.466
MERCS I THINK. WE HAVE AS YOU

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:11.436
STATED INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY

00:31:11.502 --> 00:31:13.938
IN AND INFRASTRUCTURE HERE IN

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.873
CALIFORNIA AND THAT HAS

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.042
DISABILITY DISORIENTATED EXCUSE

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:21.746
ME PICK UP AND ITS COLLECTION I

00:31:21.813 --> 00:31:23.481
HAVE A LOT OF POTENTIALLY

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:27.285
RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. AND I

00:31:27.352 --> 00:31:28.620
THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE HERE

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:29.921
WITHOUT INVESTMENT THAT IS

00:31:29.988 --> 00:31:31.923
SOMETHING BACK CALIFORNIANS

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.191
EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA KNOWS

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:35.193
WHAT THE BLUE BANUS KNOWS HOW

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.462
TO USE THE BLUE BAND. I'M THAT

00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:38.596
BEING SAID I THINK THERE ARE A

00:31:38.663 --> 00:31:39.664
LOT OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT NEED

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.532
TO BE MADE TO OUR SYSTEM AND

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.667
BECAUSE A LOT OF WHAT IS

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.435
LANDING IN THE LUMEN IS NOT

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:46.204
ULTIMATELY ENDING UP BEING

00:31:46.271 --> 00:31:48.339
RECYCLED. STILL I THINK THERE

00:31:48.406 --> 00:31:50.041
IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.676
HERE WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:54.412
ARE HAULERS AND RECYCLERS AND

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:57.515
ARMORS. TO WORK TOGETHER TO

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.484
IMPROVE THE SYSTEM BUT IT ISN'T

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:00.318
IT IS AN INCREDIBLE

00:32:00.385 --> 00:32:03.221
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE STARTED

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:05.056
IN. THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.357
WAS GROUNDBREAKING WHEN

00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:08.259
CALIFORNIA STARTED. BUILDING

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:10.928
THIS INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK AND

00:32:10.995 --> 00:32:13.064
AS OUR MATERIALS HAVE BECOME

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:14.165
MORE COMPLICATED AND

00:32:14.232 --> 00:32:15.900
CONTAMINATION IT'S BECOME. A

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:18.169
REAL ISSUE AND WE SHOULD WORK

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:19.771
TOGETHER TO FIX IT AND I LOOK

00:32:19.837 --> 00:32:21.973
FORWARD TO THAT OPPORTUNITY- I

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.341
APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT

00:32:23.408 --> 00:32:25.410
YOU WILL. ALWAYS BE OPEN TO ALL

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:27.111
SIDES SOME OF THE THINGS THAT

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:28.813
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK OUT AS YOU

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.580
MOVE FORWARD IN DEALING WITH

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.883
THIS- AND I CAN SEND YOU A LIST

00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:34.886
AS WELL AS- IS AND CONVENIENCE

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:35.753
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.588
IS BECAUSE- WE LEARNED A LOT IN

00:32:37.655 --> 00:32:38.589
THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW WE

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:40.391
LEARNED ACT. AND PEOPLE WHOSE

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:42.060
JOBS WERE NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL

00:32:42.126 --> 00:32:43.795
HAD PROBLEMS PROVIDING FOOD FOR

00:32:43.861 --> 00:32:49.200
THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR. FOUR

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:50.034
AMOUNT OF FOOD SO THAT PEOPLE

00:32:50.101 --> 00:32:52.236
COULD BE WE GET ELIMINATE FOOD

00:32:52.303 --> 00:32:54.806
INSECURITY PER SE. AND THEN WE

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:55.840
LEARNED WITH THE FOOD BANKS

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:57.809
THAT EVEN IN BAKERSFIELD IF YOU

00:32:57.875 --> 00:32:59.143
HAD TO FOOD BANKS IN THE CITY

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.346
OF BAKERSFIELD. A SINGLE MOM

00:33:01.412 --> 00:33:03.414
WITH THE STROLLER AND- YOU KNOW

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.850
TAKING TWO KIDS OR AN ELDERLY

00:33:05.917 --> 00:33:07.318
WORLD WAR TWO VETERAN OR AT

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.154
INDIVIDUAL THAT. WAS NOT AT

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:12.423
VERY AMBULATORY HOW TO MAKE IT

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.159
EVEN IN A MILE OR TWO MILES

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:16.894
FROM THEIR HOME IN MUCH LESS

00:33:16.961 --> 00:33:19.297
LOAD UP A FIFTY POUND BOX OF

00:33:19.364 --> 00:33:21.032
FOOD AND BRING IT BACK. SO I

00:33:21.099 --> 00:33:21.999
HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS

00:33:22.066 --> 00:33:23.735
REGARDING- BILLS GOING THROUGH

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:24.936
THE BUILDING ABOUT GOING BACK

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:27.038
TO THE MANUFACTURER. AND WHAT

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.606
ABOUT THE SINGLE MOM THAT WOULD

00:33:28.673 --> 00:33:29.540
NORMALLY THROW THEIR BOTTLES

00:33:29.607 --> 00:33:31.576
OUT ON THE CURB- OR IN THE BLUE

00:33:31.642 --> 00:33:33.811
VAN. BE PICKED UP BY A CURBSIDE

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.213
RECYCLING THAT COMES DOWN

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.814
EITHER TWICE OR ONCE A WEEK IN

00:33:36.881 --> 00:33:38.950
HER NEIGHBORHOOD- THE ELDERLY

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:40.918
PERSONS NEIGHBORHOOD OR-

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:43.521
ANYBODY. I MEAN I MEAN I FEEL

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:44.555
LIKE I COULD PROBABLY TAKE IT

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:46.157
BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER BUT I

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:47.291
WOULD THINK IT WOULD BE HUGE

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.127
INCONVENIENCE TO LOOK AT. YOU

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:51.262
KNOW OUR SODA BOTTLES BEER CANS

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.064
WHATEVER THEY ARE AND TAKEN

00:33:53.131 --> 00:33:55.066
BACK TO THE MANUFACTURER. AM I

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.300
JUST ASSUME LEAVING OUT ON THE

00:33:56.367 --> 00:33:57.435
CURB AND HAVE SOMEBODY PICK

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:58.870
THEM UP I'M ALL ABOUT

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.872
CONVENIENCE. SO MOVING FORWARD

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:01.939
I'D LIKE YOU TO YOU KNOW

00:34:02.006 --> 00:34:03.474
CONSIDER THOSE THINGS CONSIDER

00:34:03.541 --> 00:34:05.109
THE FACT THAT. THE SINGLE MOM

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:06.744
MAY NOT HAVE TRANSPORTATION TO

00:34:06.811 --> 00:34:07.412
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE

00:34:07.478 --> 00:34:10.281
ROOM THE MANUFACTURER. AND THE-

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:11.482
ELDERLY PERSON THAT'S NON

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:13.284
AMBULATORY MAY NOT HAVE THE

00:34:13.351 --> 00:34:14.252
ABILITY TO AND MAY I HAVE A

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:16.521
CAR- IN THE THINGS THAT WE

00:34:16.587 --> 00:34:18.189
LEARNED IN THE PANDEMIC WERE.

00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:19.490
YOU KNOW THE FOOD BANKS FOR

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:20.658
FABULOUS AND THEY SERVED A

00:34:20.725 --> 00:34:21.759
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IF YOU

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:22.627
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE

00:34:22.693 --> 00:34:24.662
THROGH. BUT THE LAST MILE WAS

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.631
ALSO NEEDED TO DELIVER THAT-

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:29.267
FOOD INTO. THE NEIGHBORHOODS

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:31.269
WHERE PEOPLE. YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:31.969
COULDN'T MAKE IT TO THE FOOD

00:34:32.036 --> 00:34:33.871
BANKS. AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:35.206
I'D LIKE YOU TO LOOK AT MOVING

00:34:35.273 --> 00:34:37.408
FORWARD SPECIFICALLY. I DON'T

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.177
SEE JUST FOR THE CONVENIENCE

00:34:39.243 --> 00:34:40.044
ISSUE BUT IT'S CONVENIENCE IN

00:34:40.111 --> 00:34:43.014
MANY WAYS- I NOTICED THAT WHEN-

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.116
THEY STUTTERED WITH THE TRASH

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.584
CANS SPECIFICALLY INTO A PLACE

00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:48.419
AND OIL DEL. WE HAD IS LIKE A

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:50.254
TRAILER PARK IN. AND THEY HAVE

00:34:50.321 --> 00:34:51.322
ALL THE LITTLE DIFFERENT TRASH

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:52.690
BINS BUT PEOPLE WOULD JUST

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:54.192
THROW THEIR GARBAGE ALL OVER IN

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:56.060
IN THEIR RESPIRE HILLS OF STUFF

00:34:56.127 --> 00:34:57.628
THAT HAD TO BE PICKED UP. AS A

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:58.763
MATTER OF FACT WE REALIZE WHAT

00:34:58.830 --> 00:34:59.931
WAS GOING ON HE WORKED WITH THE

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.866
LOCAL AND- GOVERNMENT THERE HE

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:04.802
PROVIDED US- YOU KNOW- BACKHOES

00:35:04.869 --> 00:35:06.938

00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.184
BROUGHT IN SINCE DEFINITELY.

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.819
YOU KNOW PREPARED MEALS AND-

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:22.820
YOU KNOW TRY TO TAKE HER THIS

00:35:22.887 --> 00:35:23.754
VERY POOR AREA OF OUR

00:35:23.821 --> 00:35:26.057
COMMUNITY. AND I SAID YOU KNOW

00:35:26.123 --> 00:35:26.924
WHY WOULD YOU LET STUFF PILE UP

00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:28.059
LIKE THAT IN THE GUIDE

00:35:28.125 --> 00:35:29.694
COMPLETELY ASLEEP RIGHT NOW

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:30.728
RYAN SAID. WOULD YOU WANT ME TO

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:32.430
DO WITH IT. IT DOESN'T IN THE

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:34.165
BLUE CANDLES FOR THE GREEN CAN.

00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:35.166
AND I DON'T HAVE A CAR TO TAKE

00:35:35.233 --> 00:35:36.467
IT TO THEM. AND THAT MADE

00:35:36.534 --> 00:35:38.636
PERFECT SENSE TO ME. SO AS YOU

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.971
MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL THESE

00:35:40.037 --> 00:35:41.405
THINGS I THINK THE BILLIONS OF

00:35:41.472 --> 00:35:43.174
DOLLARS- THAT HAS BEEN. PUT

00:35:43.241 --> 00:35:44.742
FORWARD AND I'M NOT DEFENDING

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.310
ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. I MEAN

00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:47.912
THERE'S JUST A BILLIONS OF

00:35:47.979 --> 00:35:50.715
DOLLARS OF- OF INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:35:50.781 --> 00:35:52.083
THAT IS A BIT PUT AT THE CREASE

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.351
A CONVENIENCE FOR ALL

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.520
CALIFORNIANS WHETHER YOU. NEED

00:35:55.586 --> 00:35:57.021
THAT CONVENIENCE OR JUST

00:35:57.088 --> 00:36:00.191
DESIRE. THAT CONVENIENCE. AND I

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.726
THINK MOVING FORWARD IT WOULD.

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.094
BE HUGE IF YOU WOULD AT LEAST

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.863
CONSIDER THAT. RAMIFICATION IF

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:06.797
CERTAIN CHANGES ARE MADE TO

00:36:06.864 --> 00:36:10.768
THIS PROGRAM. AND THOSE

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:11.335
CONVENIENCES WOULD DISAPPEAR

00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:12.270
FOR. YOU KNOW PEOPLE I GUESS

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:15.072
THAT ENJOY THE CONVENIENCE. AND

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.307
AND IT WOULD ALSO DISAPPEAR FOR

00:36:16.374 --> 00:36:17.942
PEOPLE WHO DESPERATELY NEED

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.077
THAT CONVENIENCE- IN ORDER NOT

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:21.112
TO HAVE THAT PILOT IN THEIR

00:36:21.178 --> 00:36:23.514
YARD. AS SO I'D LIKE YOUR

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.048
COMMITMENT IF YOU WOULD AT

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:27.985
LEAST LOOK AT THAT. SENATOR AND

RECYCLING REFORM OVERALL. AND I

00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:45.303
THINK YOU MAKE A VERY IMPORTANT

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:47.238
POINT PEOPLE ONLY RECYCLE AND

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:50.274
SO FAR AS THEY ARE. ABLE AND

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:53.210

APPRECIATE THAT. I DO HAVE A

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.952
COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS IF

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:02.853
THAT'S OKAY AND MAYBE NOT AND

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.489
ALL OF THE ONES THAT I HAVE

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:07.258
HERE. AND SO HOW AT THE

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.392
AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY MY

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:09.760
DISTRICT HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.429
ABOUT FINDING ENOUGH RECYCLED

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:14.699
PLASTIC- FOR THE- THERMOFORMED

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:17.335
CONTAINERS AND THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.502
I WHAT'S THE STATE DOING TO

00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:20.905
ENCOURAGE RECYCLERS OF PLASTICS

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:24.475
TO MEET THE- UPCOMING MINIMUM

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:27.244
CONTENT DEADLINES. AND THIS IS

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.780
A NEAT A STICKY WICKET SQL

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:32.283
SENATOR DRIVE BECAUSE AND

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.585
THAT'S THURMOND FORMS ARE USING

00:37:34.652 --> 00:37:36.687
THE SAME PLASTICS THAT INSTEAD

00:37:36.754 --> 00:37:38.556
OF PLASTIC WATER BOTTLES AND

00:37:38.623 --> 00:37:39.523
BEVERAGE CONTAINER BOTTLES ARE

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.094
USING AND NOW THERE IS A DEMAND

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.829
FOR ACTUALLY A PLASTIC THAT WAS

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:48.566
IN MUCH LESSER DEMAND- AND AS

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:51.736
IN PAST YEARS. AND SO I THINK

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:54.071
IT IN IN IN AS I SAID WAS A

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:55.473
STICKY WICKET BECAUSE IT REALLY

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.709
GETS YOU ON THAT QUESTION ABOUT

00:37:58.776 --> 00:38:00.077
HOW WE RECYCLE AND HOW WEEKS

00:38:00.144 --> 00:38:01.846
ALEXIS MATERIALS AND WHETHER OR

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.648
NOT WE MAKES LESS THAN THEY ARE

00:38:03.714 --> 00:38:06.617
ULTIMATELY RECYCLABLE AND- AND

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:07.985
UNFORTUNATELY OUR CURRENT

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:10.554
WEBSITE SYSTEM. I'M RESULT IN A

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.323
LOT OF THOSE PLASTICS NOT AND

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.026
NOT ABLE TO BE RECYCLED AND SO

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:16.394
YOU'VE HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.628
WITH THIS PLAN IS THAT WE NEED

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.630
TO BE WORKING WITH ARMOR AND

00:38:19.697 --> 00:38:21.465
THE REST OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:22.400
TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE GET

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.968
THOSE PROSPECTS BACK IN A WAY

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.603
THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.773
THAT'S RECYCLABLE. AND THEY

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:31.042
STERN FORMS I WE GET THEM TO

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:32.410
THE PLACE AND THERE WERE I'M

00:38:32.476 --> 00:38:34.311
SOME OF OUR LARGER PRODUCERS AS

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:35.579
WELL AS OUR SMALLER PRODUCERS

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:36.881
THAT USE A SERVER FARMS ARE

00:38:36.947 --> 00:38:37.715
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.316
MAKE THOSE PRODUCTS RECYCLED

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:41.819
THEMSELVES AND SO. IT IS AN

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.454
ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH OUR

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:44.588
PARTNERS IN AGRICULTURAL

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.724
INDUSTRY AND SPEND RECYCLING

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:47.892
INDUSTRY AND WORKS TO FIGURE

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:50.861
OUT HOW DO WE AT AGAIN THAT

00:38:50.928 --> 00:38:52.263
THAT NEVER ENDING LIFE OF A

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.932
PARTICULAR PRODUCT. AND WE NEED

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:56.634

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:57.968
CLAM SHELLS AND SOME OF THESE

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:59.670
OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS IN A

00:38:59.737 --> 00:39:06.410
WAY THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE.

00:39:06.477 --> 00:39:06.977
THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT WE

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:07.578

AND LET'S SEE WHERE THAT ONE

00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:15.319
GOES AND- SO ACT CARRY CYCLE- I

00:39:15.386 --> 00:39:17.288

NOT HAVE IT DEVELOPED OR WHAT

00:39:24.995 --> 00:39:26.297
YOUR THOUGHT PROCESSES BUT YOU

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.499
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT. THE

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:31.001
INTO LIFE PER SE OF- PEAVEY

00:39:31.068 --> 00:39:32.937
PANELS AND BATTERIES FOR YOU

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.772
KNOW ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.508
ENERGY STORAGE- I KNOW IN IN

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:39.477
BORON IN MY DISTRICT THERE AT

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:40.945
PRODUCING LITHIUM FOR LITHIUM

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:41.946
BATTERY SO WE HAVE A LONGER

00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.013
STORES HELP MEET RENEWABLE

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:46.584
GOALS. AND WE ALSO HAVE AGAIN I

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:47.351
KNOW THIS COMMITTEES PRIOR TO

00:39:47.418 --> 00:39:49.019
HEARING ABOUT IT EVERYBODY IS

00:39:49.086 --> 00:39:50.855
53% OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE.

00:39:50.921 --> 00:39:53.324
LARGE SCALE SOLAR AND NOT JUST

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.658
ROOF TOP SOLAR BUT LARGE SCALE

00:39:54.725 --> 00:39:57.862
SOLAR AND- SO AS I MEAN I THINK

00:39:57.928 --> 00:39:59.096
THE PLANT IT'S GOING IN NOW IS

00:39:59.163 --> 00:39:59.597
FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.832
DISNEYLAND. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.734
WE NEED TO BUT WHERE DO THESE

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.469
THINGS GO AFTER THEIR LIFE IS

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:06.971
AND EXHAUSTED HEARING WE'VE

00:40:07.037 --> 00:40:11.909
USED IT FOR. RENEWABLE ENERGY I.

00:40:11.976 --> 00:40:12.910
MEAN WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THAT.

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:16.413
SENATE AND IS. SEXY QUESTION WE

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.481
ARE PART OF AN ONGOING

00:40:17.548 --> 00:40:18.616
CONVERSATION WITH THE ENERGY

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:20.217
COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.552
OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL.

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:23.053
VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THIS ISSUE

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:26.323
ON BOTH BATTERIES AND TV PANELS

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:27.558
BECAUSE THAT IS A HUGE

00:40:27.625 --> 00:40:29.460
QUESTIONS WE KNOW. THESE AREN'T

00:40:29.527 --> 00:40:31.428
SIMPLY PIECES OF PLASTIC THESE

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:35.466
ARE VERY COMPLICATED. AND

00:40:35.533 --> 00:40:37.935
MATERIALS WITH INTEGRATED AND

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.804
METALS CENTER AND I'M THAT HAVE

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:41.806
HOPEFULLY ADDITIONAL LIFE TO

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.240
GIVE AND BUT IF THEY'RE

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.309
RECYCLING PROCESS WILL BE. VERY

00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:47.211
VERY COMPLICATED AND IT'S FUNNY

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:48.312
THAT YOU BRING UP THIS EXAMPLE

00:40:48.379 --> 00:40:50.781
BECAUSE- I HAVE MY VERY FIRST

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.750
THOUGHTS AROUND A CIRCULAR

00:40:52.817 --> 00:40:54.919
ECONOMY. HE MET BECAUSE I'M

00:40:54.985 --> 00:40:56.921
SENATOR MONEY AUTHORED A BILL

00:40:56.987 --> 00:40:58.789
ON THIS SUBJECT MANY YEARS AGO.

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:00.991
I'M SPECIFICALLY SAYING WE'RE

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.293
PUTTING ALL THESE TV PANELS OUT

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:03.260
IN THE WORLD WHAT ARE WE GOING

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:04.895
TO. DO WITH THAT HE SAID THAT'S

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.831
A REALLY GOOD QUESTION SENATOR

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:07.765
WE SHOULD BE DSIGNING OUR

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:10.768
PRODUCTS. DO YOU HAVE A SECOND

00:41:10.835 --> 00:41:13.070
LIFE TEN AND NEVER ENDING LIKE

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:13.838
WE SHOULD BE DESIGNING IT WHICH

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.539
I UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR PRODUCTS

00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:16.373
ARE GOING AT THE END OF THEIR

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.242
LIFE. AND WHAT THEIR NEXT LIFE

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:20.244
LOOKS LIKE. I'M AS WE ARE

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.645
DESIGNING ON NOT AT THE BACK

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.147
AND WE WERE TRYING TO FIGURE IT

00:41:23.214 --> 00:41:25.049
OUT AND SERVE. THIS IS A HUGE

00:41:25.115 --> 00:41:26.217
QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS MANY OF

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.484
OUR PREMIUM CHANNELS ARE COMING

00:41:27.551 --> 00:41:29.153
TO THE END OF THEIR LIFE. I'M

00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:31.155
THEIR FIRST LIFE. AND THAT WE

00:41:31.222 --> 00:41:32.423
ARE WORKING WITH THE ENERGY

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.859
COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY ON- ON

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.927
THIS BIG HUGE QUESTIONS SO I

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:42.533
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. THIS

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.100
IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE SPENT

YOU REFERENCED IT IN SOME OF

00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.259

WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO TALK A

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:06.730
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:08.565
ESPECIALLY IN RELATIONSHIP TO

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:10.634
DISTRICTS LIKE MINE URBAN OUT

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:16.139
POOR- AND DIVERSE- YOU KNOW WE-

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.374
AND I'M SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.375
ABOUT THE SOUTHERN PART OF MY

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:20.377
DISTRICT. I LIKE TO SAY WE DO A

00:51:20.444 --> 00:51:22.112
LOT OF RECYCLING YOU KNOW POOR

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:23.480
FOLKS WERE IN THE RECYCLING

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:25.982
GAME LONG BEFORE IT WAS- YOU

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:28.718
KNOW TRENDY- AND YOU ACTUALLY

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.487
TALKED ABOUT THAT YOURSELF

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:32.589
WITH- THEIR RECENT THE RE USE

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:35.392
OF TEXTILES. SO WE ARE YOU KNOW

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:36.026
COLLECTING CANS WE ARE

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:39.396
RECYCLING- BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:39.930
WHEN THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS

00:51:39.996 --> 00:51:42.466
AROUND. GREEN INVESTMENT IN

00:51:42.532 --> 00:51:44.568
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. THOSE

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.803
DOLLARS AND THOSE COMMITMENTS

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.172
GO TO OTHER PLACES AND MAYBE

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:50.507
IT'S BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OPEN

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.309
SPACE SEARCHING FOR LAND I

00:51:52.375 --> 00:51:53.810
DON'T KNOW WHY MAYBE IT'S

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.579
BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T WANT TO.

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:56.880
PUT THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT IN

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:59.416
AN URBAN CENTER. BUT I BELIEVE

00:51:59.483 --> 00:52:01.084
THAT IT'S REALLY HARD TO CREATE

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:02.819
BUY IN FROM PEOPLE WHEN YOU

00:52:02.886 --> 00:52:05.722
OVERLOOK THEM- WHEN YOU'RE

00:52:05.789 --> 00:52:06.590
HAVING DISCUSSIONS AROUND

00:52:06.656 --> 00:52:10.227
INVESTMENT. AND SO. SINCE WE DO

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:11.194
HAVE SOME OF THE WORST AIR

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:12.829
QUALITY SINCE WE ALSO DO HAVE

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.130
SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.599
UNEMPLOYMENT IT SEEMS LIKE IT

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:16.933
MAKES SENSE TO KIND OF TALK

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.069
ABOUT HOW YOU CONVERGE- OF

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:21.538
THOSE TWO ISSUES. AT AND CREATE

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:23.273
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO AB

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.642
SUSPEND SUSTAINABLE. BUT ALSO

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.577

A BONE OF CONTENTION FOR A

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:47.193
NUMBER OF FOLKS DURING THE TIME

01:52:47.260 --> 01:52:48.194

SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE CASE SO

01:53:10.016 --> 01:53:11.784
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:14.087
DURING RIGHT NOW GETTING TO

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:14.921
THIRTY TWO YEARS IS EVALUATING

01:53:14.988 --> 01:53:17.090
CASE. SO WHEN I LOOK AT AN

OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING CASE.

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:22.028

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:23.029
WHAT I HAVE TO LOOK AT IS THE

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:25.331
WALK IN THE STANDS THE

01:53:25.398 --> 01:53:27.734
STANDARDS CHANGED WITH THE NEW-

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:29.402
USE OF FORCE LOCK AND IS

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:30.937
ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING I WOULD

01:53:31.004 --> 01:53:32.705
CONSIDER WHEN CONSIDERING

01:53:32.772 --> 01:53:34.174
WHETHER TO FILE ON THE SITE

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:37.677

OKAY WANT TO GIVE ME HOPE- I

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.582
THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:44.951
DISCUSSED OUR IN OUR-

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.219
CONVERSATION WITH ONE ANOTHER

01:53:46.286 --> 01:53:48.254
IS TRAINING AND IT SEEMS LIKE

01:53:48.321 --> 01:53:49.856
EVERY YEAR THE LEGISLATURE IS

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.057

FIRST. I THINK SOMETIMES IN

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:01.334
THIS IS MY PERSONAL BELIEF THAT

01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.303
TRAINING CAN BECOME UBIQUITOUS

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:03.903
WITH KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE

01:54:03.970 --> 01:54:08.708
ROAD. AND YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:11.244
TRAINING TOO MUCH AND NOT

01:54:11.311 --> 01:54:13.479

01:54:13.546 --> 01:54:18.885
ISSUE- AND ARE THERE OTHER WAYS

01:54:18.952 --> 01:54:22.088
THAT WE CAN BE ENGAGING POST.

01:54:22.155 --> 01:54:24.457

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:27.460
OFFICERS GET. THE GUIDELINES

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:31.397
AND THE SUPPORT- AND GUIDANCE

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:34.500
THAT THEY NEED- TO BE ABLE TO

01:54:34.567 --> 01:54:36.803
DO THIS KIND OF WORK IN A WAY

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:39.906
THAT KEEPS THEM AND THOSE THAT

01:54:39.973 --> 01:54:41.674
THEY ARE PROTECTING SAFE.

01:54:41.741 --> 01:54:46.145
SHERIFF. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH

YOU THERE IS A LOT OF MANDATED

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.016
TRAINING THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:52.485
FIX IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:54.520

IT'S TRUE THEY SHOULD KNOW ALL

01:54:58.891 --> 01:54:59.559
THE THINGS THAT THERE'S A

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:00.727

CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

01:55:23.683 --> 01:55:25.084

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:27.887
CONCEPTS EACH JUST THAT BASIC

01:55:27.954 --> 01:55:30.490

CHAIR DOUBLE. HOW YOU AND WE TO

02:01:00.820 --> 02:01:01.887
A BIT ABOUT THIS EARLIER TODAY

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:03.522
HOW HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN

02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:06.025
THE TRAINING ISN'T WORKING- YOU

02:01:06.092 --> 02:01:08.094
KNOW WHAT WHAT. DOES THAT

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.595
CRITERIA LOOK LIKE OR WHAT ARE

02:01:09.662 --> 02:01:12.164
THE DETERMINANTS. WHAT WHAT

02:01:12.231 --> 02:01:13.833
WOULD BE WHAT AGAIN GOING BACK

02:01:13.899 --> 02:01:15.301
TO THEIR ACTIONS IF WE ANALYZE

02:01:15.368 --> 02:01:17.303
AN OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTING

02:01:17.370 --> 02:01:20.406
AND WE SEE HERE READING ABOUT

02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:21.841
SOME VERY BAD DECISIONS BEING

02:01:21.907 --> 02:01:24.043
MADE WE GO BACK TO THE TRAINING

02:01:24.110 --> 02:01:25.978
AND STATE WHAT LET'S TAKE A

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:27.279
VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THIS

02:01:27.346 --> 02:01:28.848
PARTICULAR OFFICER WHAT

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.549
TRAINING TO BE HAPPY AND THEN

02:01:30.616 --> 02:01:31.550
WE HAVE TO TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:32.752
AT THE TRAINING WASN'T THIS

02:01:32.818 --> 02:01:35.154
PARTICULAR OFFICER. WHO DIDN'T

02:01:35.221 --> 02:01:36.622
GET IT WHAT WAS THAT THE

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:38.591
QUALITY OF THE TRAINING I LOVE

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:40.192
THE IDEA OF LOOKING VIDEOS

02:01:40.259 --> 02:01:41.327
BECAUSE THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT

02:01:41.394 --> 02:01:42.962
A LOT OF DIFFERENT VIDEO SO WE

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:45.297
COULD GATHER TWENTY BIT MANY OF

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:46.866
THE STOCKS ARE ABOUT SHRINK.

02:01:46.932 --> 02:01:48.901
SHOOTINGS ARE NOW ON VIDEO WE

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:50.236
CAN GATHER THAT STATE WHERE THE

02:01:50.302 --> 02:01:52.138
OUTLINES YEAR WITH THE PROBLEMS

02:01:52.204 --> 02:01:54.073
WE CONTINUE TO MAKE IS THAT

02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.107
WHEN SOMEONE COMES TOWARD YOU

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:56.475
WITH A KNIFE SO WHEN THEY COME

02:01:56.542 --> 02:01:58.778
TOWARD YOU WITH THE CAR- WHAT'S

02:01:58.844 --> 02:02:00.379
THE DISTANCE AND ALL OF THAT IS

02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:02.081
OCCURRING. AND THROUGH LOOKING

02:02:02.148 --> 02:02:03.916
AT VIDEOS AND THROUGH ANALYZING

02:02:03.983 --> 02:02:05.985
SITUATIONS AND IN TERMS OF THE

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:06.719
QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED TO

02:02:06.786 --> 02:02:09.622
SHARE WELL I THINK THE IDEA OF

02:02:09.689 --> 02:02:12.124
HOW YOU GET ON THE STREET THAT.

02:02:12.191 --> 02:02:14.660
AND I THINK YOU CAN DO THAT TO

02:02:14.727 --> 02:02:16.462
SOME EXTENT WITH THE-

02:02:16.529 --> 02:02:17.830
QUESTIONNAIRES IS ALSO

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.565
QUESTIONS WELL WRITTEN AND I

02:02:19.632 --> 02:02:21.333
THINK THEY CAN BE WELL WRITTEN

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.636
BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AND SO I CAN

02:02:23.703 --> 02:02:25.237
OFTEN READ ONE OF THESE CAPS IN

02:02:25.304 --> 02:02:27.540
TERMS OF YOU KNOW DEFENDANTS IN

02:02:27.606 --> 02:02:29.275
TERMS BINOCULARS VERY USED IN

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.776
SATURDAY AND THEY TALK ABOUT

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.778
HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO CHANGE.

02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:34.180
THEIR BELIEFS IN THAT PERSON'S

02:02:34.246 --> 02:02:35.715
ANSWER SO LET'S USE OUR

02:02:35.781 --> 02:02:42.922
SCIENTISTS. NOT PSYCHOLOGISTS

02:02:42.988 --> 02:02:43.989
TO GET THAT TO. YEAH I AND I

02:02:44.056 --> 02:02:45.658
WAS JUST SPEAKING. TO USER FOR.

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:46.659
I THINKING ABOUT- ALL OF THE-

02:02:46.726 --> 02:02:48.961
RIGHT THAT YOU ARE ARE IN-

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:50.730
REQUIRED TO DO ARE ENCOURAGED

02:02:50.796 --> 02:02:52.732
TO DO. I DON'T KNOW SURE FRONT

02:02:52.798 --> 02:02:58.237
IF YOU WANTED TO ADD. THE CARD-

02:02:58.304 --> 02:03:00.239
DO EITHER OF YOU THINK AND I'LL

02:03:00.306 --> 02:03:01.741
LET YOU SURE FRONT GO FIRST

02:03:01.807 --> 02:03:03.342
THAT WE'RE DOING ENOUGH AS IT

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:05.277
RELATES TO- THE MENTAL HEALTH.

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:10.516
OF OFFICERS- THAT WE- HIRE AND

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:13.052
HAVE THAT IS BECOMING A BIGGER

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:15.855
AND BIGGER ISSUE- FOR GENERAL

02:03:15.921 --> 02:03:17.123
DISCUSSION BUT ALSO AS IT

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:19.992
RELATES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- I

02:03:20.059 --> 02:03:21.327
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL HAVE TO

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:23.129
REVEAL ITSELF AND- TRAININGS

02:03:23.195 --> 02:03:25.798
WHICH OF COURSE I JUST TOLD YOU

02:03:25.865 --> 02:03:28.134
I'M LEERY OF- TO SOME EXTENT

02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:31.971
BUT- ARE. ARE YOU SEEING THAT

02:03:32.037 --> 02:03:34.607
IS SORT OF THE NEXT. HURDLE

02:03:34.673 --> 02:03:35.174
THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:39.411
OVERCOME. I MEAN I UNDERSTAND

02:03:39.478 --> 02:03:40.579
THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR OFFICE

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:44.283
DIRECT. RIGHT SO THAT IS A BIG

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:47.453
CONCERN BECAUSE- SUICIDE IS.

02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:48.521
MUCH HIGHER MOST LAW

02:03:48.587 --> 02:03:50.089
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAN ANY

02:03:50.156 --> 02:03:52.158
OTHER FASHION AND OF COURSE WE

02:03:52.224 --> 02:03:54.627
HAVE ACCESS THAT MEANS A LOT

02:03:54.693 --> 02:03:57.329
MORE THAN OTHERS DO SO IT IS A

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:59.832
STRESSFUL JOB AND IT IS ALSO. A

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:02.434
MACHO JOB WE DON'T WANT TO

02:04:02.501 --> 02:04:06.939
ACKNOWLEDGE. ANY SORT OF THIS

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.207
SEVEN TO SAY THAT YOU NEED HELP

02:04:08.274 --> 02:04:13.379
IS THERE A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. SO

02:04:13.445 --> 02:04:13.979
IT'S HARD TO ASK FOR HELP WITH

02:04:14.046 --> 02:04:15.915
YOUR- SO HOW DO YOU SEE ALL-

02:04:15.981 --> 02:04:17.316
AND OVER IN THE SURE THAT.

02:04:17.383 --> 02:04:17.883
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. YOU JUST

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:21.086
HAVE TO SEND THEM. TO HELP EVEN

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:21.987
THOUGH THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:23.622
IT SO WE NOT MUCH HAPPENS

02:04:23.689 --> 02:04:24.924
YOU'RE GONNA COUNTY IT'S VERY

02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:26.659
SMALL. YOU DON'T GET A LOT OF

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:28.060
CRIMES BUT WHEN SOMETHING DOES

02:04:28.127 --> 02:04:29.528
HAPPEN IT'S SUPER TRAUMATIC IT

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:30.296
MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT I

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:31.897
THOUGHT HUNDRED FACSIMILE HE

02:04:31.964 --> 02:04:33.465
INDICATED IT DOESN'T BOTHER

02:04:33.532 --> 02:04:34.633
LEVINE I DON'T THINK HE'S

02:04:34.700 --> 02:04:37.469
MAKING OR SEEN THAT OR- NOT.

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:39.572
THAT MEANT EVERYTHING THAT'S

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:42.675
RIGHT SOMEONE. TO COUNSELING-

02:04:42.741 --> 02:04:43.809
AND WE USE OUR PURPOSE AND

02:04:43.876 --> 02:04:44.910
CAN'T BREAKING UP BECAUSE WE

02:04:44.977 --> 02:04:46.712
DON'T HAVE THAT RESOURCE HERE

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:50.082
AND SAID GO. TALK DON'T TALK.

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:51.617
ABOUT IT YOU NEED TO GO AND

THE CULTURE IN THESE PARTICULAR

02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:27.473

THINK WE SHOULD BE DOING PRE

02:08:29.868 --> 02:08:32.304
HAB BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:34.640

RESPOND IN A CERTAIN WAY AND

02:08:40.846 --> 02:08:42.548
ONE OF THOSE WAYS COULD BE TO

BECOME VIOLENT THEMSELVES AND

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:46.585
TO TAKE A LOT OF BULLYING. OF

THERE BEFORE THEY GET IN OR

02:08:50.923 --> 02:08:52.257
THEY COULD DEVELOP IT SO BY

UNIT RESPONDED TO THE RODNEY

02:10:31.290 --> 02:10:33.759
KING INCIDENT- WHICH IN MY MIND

02:10:33.825 --> 02:10:36.361
SEEM TO BE THE GENESIS OF SORT

02:10:36.428 --> 02:10:37.296
OF YOU KNOW PUBLIC RECORDINGS

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:40.265
AND SHARING- HOW OFFICERS

02:10:40.332 --> 02:10:43.168
INTERACT WITH SUBDUE WOULD DE

02:10:43.235 --> 02:10:45.003
ESCALATE- THE FOLKS THAT THEY

02:10:45.070 --> 02:10:46.438
COME INTO CONTACT WITH AND THEN

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:48.207
FAST FORWARD. YOU KNOW WE JUST

02:10:48.273 --> 02:10:50.442

DEREK CHAU VAN AND GEORGE

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:54.947
FLOYD. AND THERE'S SO MUCH

02:10:55.013 --> 02:10:58.483
IRONY- IN THAT BECAUSE SOME

02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:59.885
FOLKS WOULD ARGUE THAT WE

02:10:59.952 --> 02:11:02.487
HAVEN'T REALLY. MADE HUGE

02:11:02.554 --> 02:11:06.258
CHANGES- AND HOW OFFICERS.

02:11:06.325 --> 02:11:09.895
RESPOND TO CERTAIN FOLKS INTO

02:11:09.962 --> 02:11:12.397
CERTAIN SITUATIONS I JUST

02:11:12.464 --> 02:11:13.465
WANTED TO KNOW YOUR SORT OF

02:11:13.532 --> 02:11:15.167
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BECAUSE

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:16.635
YOU'VE BEEN SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN

02:11:16.702 --> 02:11:18.604
IN URBAN BEEN AND RURAL. YOU'VE

02:11:18.670 --> 02:11:20.973
OBVIOUSLY ELEVATED- IN RANK

02:11:21.039 --> 02:11:24.243
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS- AND- I

02:11:24.309 --> 02:11:27.613
MEAN. IS THERE HOPE THAT WE

02:11:27.679 --> 02:11:30.148
SHOULD HAVE- IN THE FACT THAT

02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:32.684
CHANGE HAS BEEN MADE BECAUSE

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:33.986
FOR SOME IT WOULD SEEM NOT AT

02:11:34.052 --> 02:11:35.153
ALL FOR OTHERS IT WOULD SEEM

02:11:35.220 --> 02:11:37.923
IMPERCEPTIBLE. BUT THAT

02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.423
CERTAINLY CANNOT BE THE

02:11:38.490 --> 02:11:43.629
NARRATIVE. RIGHT SO CHANGE HAS

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:45.330
BEEN MADE BUT I WOULDN'T SAY

02:11:45.397 --> 02:11:48.800
THAT NATIONWIDE CHANGES THAT.

02:11:48.867 --> 02:11:50.969
CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:51.903
LEADER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

02:11:51.970 --> 02:11:54.306
HOW WE APPROACH THINGS AND

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:55.674
CERTAINLY THE RODNEY KING

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:57.843
INCIDENT WAS A SEMINAL MOMENT

02:11:57.909 --> 02:11:59.778
AND IT CHANGED LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:11:59.845 --> 02:12:01.046
CERTAINLY CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY

02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:04.383
LOS EXPERTS FROM THE WEST

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:06.385
COAST. WE DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY

02:12:06.451 --> 02:12:07.686
AND IT TAKES THE REST OF THE

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:09.554
COUNTRY WILL THEY CATCH UP AND

02:12:09.621 --> 02:12:13.692
WHAT HAPPENS SHE DIRECTLY. WITH

02:12:13.759 --> 02:12:14.192
ORDER AND THEIR SHARED.

02:12:14.259 --> 02:12:19.197
HORRIBLE. I'M SURE GIVE ALL IT

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:20.565
SAID IT AND I DON'T KNOW

02:12:20.632 --> 02:12:23.735
ANYBODY IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO.

02:12:23.802 --> 02:12:25.203
OKAY YOU SAID WHAT HAPPENED

02:12:25.270 --> 02:12:26.371
THERE WAS RIGHT I DON'T KNOW

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:31.243
ANYBODY WHO SUPPORTS THAT. BUT

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:34.012
IT HAPPENED SO WHAT'S GOING TO

02:12:34.079 --> 02:12:36.648
HAPPEN AGAIN SO WE DO NEED A

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:37.816

THERE'S MORE NATIONAL EFFORTS-

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:41.687

CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS BEEN A

02:12:42.921 --> 02:12:45.090
LEADER IN THERE IS EVEN A

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:46.091

IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO THE

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:06.511
