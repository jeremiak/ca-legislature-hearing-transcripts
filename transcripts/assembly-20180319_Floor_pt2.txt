AS I OBSERVE THE HARSH RHETORIC ON THE NATIONAL STAGE I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP IN CALIFORNIA OF OUR THREE BROWN. GOVERNMENT AND OUR CONSCIOUS ABILITY AS WE NAVIGATED THE GREAT RECESSION AND BEYOND. IT IS TRUE WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE CHALLENGES BUT CALIFORNIA SURVIVES AND THRIVES. BECAUSE OF OUR COLLECTIVE WISDOM I'VE UNWAVERING WILL AND OUR MUTUAL COMMITMENT TO THE RULE OF LAW. IT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN EASY. BEFORE YOU RENEWED INVESTMENT IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. DURING THE BUDGET CRUNCH YEARS. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS REFORMED. AND ADDITIONAL WORK FELL UPON THE COURTS TO ABSORB BROUGHT BY THOSE CHANGES. IT WAS DURING THE BUDGET CRUNCH YEARS THAT THOSE REFORMS UNWOUND DECADES OF LAWS PASSED BY PREVIOUS LEGISLATURE'S AND SIGNED BY PREVIOUS GOVERNOR. IT WAS DURING THOSE BUDGET CRUNCH YEARS THAT CALIFORNIA'S PRIORITIES AND POLICIES CHANGED AND THE COURTS WERE TASKED WITH INTERPRETING AND IMPLEMENTING THOSE CHANGES AND WE DID SO FOR EXAMPLE. BY PROCESS SEEN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW FILINGS FOR RE SENTENCED. AND THIS WAS AFFECTED AND CONTINUES TO AFFECT EVERY LEVEL OF COURT AND AS YOU KNOW WE USE OUR LIMITED RESOURCES AND FOCUSED IN ON CRIMINAL MATTERS. NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION AND THE STATUTES MANDATE THAT FOCUS BUT BECAUSE INDIVIDUAL LIBERTIES WERE AT STAKE. AND NOW YEARS LATER AFTER RENEWED INVESTMENT IN THE JUDICIAL BRANCH THANKS TO YOU AND THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR. WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP BACK AND STUDY. THE NEEDS OF OUR COURT USERS AND THE FUTURE OF JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE FIRST TURNED TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE COURT USERS WHO ARE INDIGENT AND ACCUSED. AND IT IS IN THAT SITUATION WE ASKED. IS MONEY BAIL SAFE AND IS IT EVEN FAIR. AND SO THE ANSWER LIES IN OUR PRE TRIAL DETENTION REPORT. A REPORT THAT HAS THE ECHOES OF HISTORY FROM NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN THEN ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT F. KENNEDY GAVE CONGRESSIONAL TESTIMONY. AND HE SAID ABOUT THE MAKE ABOUT THE MONEY BILL SYSTEM THEN. THAT IT IS A VEHICLE. FOR SYSTEMATIC INJUSTICE AND HE SAID. IT IS CRUEL AND THE COST A BACK SYSTEM IS NEEDLESS NO I'M GONNA TELL YOU IN NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT WAS PRETTY STRONG LANGUAGE. AND I WILL SUBMIT TO YOU THAT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IT IS A CLARION CALL FOR JUSTICE. LET ME. OR REPORT WAS DELIVERED BY IN INTENTIONALLY SELECTED DIVERSE GROUP. JUDGES AND THE SEA OH AND BY DIVERSE I MEAN MEN AND WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR. JUDGE WITH MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE JUDGES WITH ONLY A FEW. I JUDGES WHO CAME FROM RURAL AND URBAN COUNTY AND JUDGES WHO CAME FROM SMALL AND LARGE COUNT. WE HAD A JUDGE ON THIS WORK GROUP WAS A FORMER DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WE HAVE A JUDGE ON THIS WORKGROUP WAS A FORMER DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER. WE HEADED JUDGE ON THIS WORKGROUP WHO WAS A FORMER COP. NOW I SMILE BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO BE A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. EXCEPT THAT I HAVE FAITH AND CONTINUE TO HAVE FAITH. IN THE DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR BRANCH WHO WITH ARE SCARED DNA. WILL DELIBERATE IN A FAIR AND JUST MANNER. AND I'M TOLD THAT THE FIRST MEETING THIS GROUP AGREED ON THAT THING. BUT AFTER YEARS WORTH OF STUDY. AND PUBLIC MEETINGS I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THEY DELIVERED A UNANIMOUS REPORT WITH TEN RECOMMENDATIONS. TEN RECOMMENDATIONS TAKEN AS A WHOLE NOT PARKS REFLECT AFFAIR SAFE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. NOW AFTER THE MAIL STUDY WE TURNED TO THE FUTURE OF JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA AND I FORM THE FUTURE. IT CONSISTED OF COURT USERS COURT EMPLOYEES LAWYERS JUDGES. AND I ASK THEM TO QUESTION THE PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW WE GO FORWARD IN THE FUTURE WITH JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA. AND AT THE TIME WE WERE CONCERNED WITH TWO MAJOR FORCES. THE FIRST WAS ANY INCOME INEQUALITY. BECAUSE WE KNEW THAT AT THE TIME AND THE BRANCH WAS LOSING RESOURCES INCOME INEQUALITY IN CALIFORNIA WAS ON THE RISE. IN FACT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA REPORTS. THAT OF THE POOREST CALIFORNIANS THEIR INCOMES DROPPED BY NEARLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. AND THOSE INCOMES HAVE NOT RECOVERED SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION. THE OTHER MAJOR FORCE WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THE FUTURES COMMISSION WAS WHAT TO DO AND HOW TO APPROACH. THE PROFILE OF THE NEW PORT USER. SO IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE WHEN ONLINE YOU CAN ORDER GROCERIES AND YOUR DINNER WITHIN HOURS TO YOUR DOORSTEP. AND NGUYEN RETAIL AND ENTERTAINMENT IS ON DEMAND AND WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR NEWS CYCLE. HOW DO WE PROVIDE ACCESS IN FAIRNESS TO GENERATION Z.? WELL THE FUTURES COMMISSION WITH SIXTY FOUR MEMBERS STRONG. LED BY THE INDOMITABLE DUO OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CHARACTER OREGON AND NOW RETIRED JUSTICE BILL MCGINNIS FROM THE APPELLATE. DISTRICT FIRST D. C. A.. WITH SIXTY FOUR MEMBERS STRONG TWO YEARS OF VOLUNTEER WORK DELIVERED POTHOLE SOBRE ARENA INNOVATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS. AND I AM GRATIFIED THAT THE GOVERNOR STRONG PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH REFERENCES THREE OF THOSE FUTURES RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FIRST IS. NINETEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO COME TO COURT WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS COME TO COURT WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. AND WE KNOW THAT. IN CIVIL CASES IN THREE QUARTERS OF CIVIL CASES AT LEAST ONE SIDE DOESN'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY. AND OUR SELF HELP PROGRAM SERVES AT LEAST A MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR. AND ARE SELF HELP WEBSITE RECEIVES FOUR POINT THREE MILLION UNIQUE VISITS EVERY YEAR. SO THE NEED FOR SELF HELP IS REALLY UNDENIABLE. AND SECOND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES AND WE SUPPORT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR OUR EFFORTS TO INITIATE A TECH BASED TRAFFIC SYSTEM. IN FACT ONE THAT COULD LEAD TO A CRACK DECRIMINALIZING MINOR TRAFFIC IN TIONS AND MAKING LIFE SIMPLER FOR EVERYONE. BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA PAY THAT TICKET ANYWAY YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT ONLINE. AND THIRD THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES AND WE SUPPORT FOR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS IN CIVIL MATTERS. NOW THE BAIL STUDY. THE BILL STEADY AND THE FUTURES RECOMMENDATION ARE FORWARD LOOKING. WHAT'S ESPECIALLY FORWARD LOOKING IS ANOTHER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BY. FOR THE TRIAL COURTS. THIS WILL ALLOW THE TRIAL COURT'S THE NEEDED FLEXIBILITY TO RESTORE SERVICES THEY REGRETTABLY REDUCE. FEW OF US NEED TO BE REMINDED THAT IN THE GREAT RECESSION CIVIL CASES TOOK A BACKSEAT TO CRIMINAL CASES. AND FOR MANY COURTS CIVIL DOCKETS WERE AND CONTINUE TO BE GREATLY DELAY. AND SO THIS ADDITIONAL MONEY WOULD HELP COURTS HELP THOSE WHO WERE UNFORTUNATELY LEFT BEHIND THOSE SEEKING CIVIL JUSTICE. AND AS YOU KNOW CIVIL JUSTICE ENCOMPASSES WIDE AND COMPLICATED BODIES OF LAW MIGHT CONSTITUTE CHAU LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW AND CONSUMER LAW. AND HEALTH AND WELFARE ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT FOCUSES ON PLANES IN PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS FOR DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION MISCONDUCT LOST JOBS. AND MANY MANY MORE. AND WHO WAS LEFT BEHIND WILL CHILDREN AND ELDERS VETERANS BUSINESSES OUR NEIGHBORS YOUR RELATIVES ARE CONSTITUENTS WERE LEFT BEHIND. AND I KNOW THAT EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING A TIMELY AND FAIR ACCESSIBLE DAY IN COURT FOR ARKANSAS SHE WENT. AND THIS MONEY WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY. FOR COURTS TO HELP AND HAVE AND RESOLVE CASES IN A TIMELY MANNER IN THE CIVIL ARENA. AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW. IS THERE AN ONSLAUGHT OF CASES WAITING TO BE FILED. WITH THE FIRES ALONE WERE INFORMED THAT ARE RESIDENTS OF FILED MORE THAN FORTY FIVE THOUSAND INSURANCE CLAIMS. TOTALLY MORE THAN TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS CONCERNING THIRTY TWO THOUSAND HOMES AND FOUR THOUSAND BUSINESSES. AND SO KNOWING THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE HAD A HISTORICAL DELAY IN OUR CIVIL JUSTICE ARENA. AND IN THE ANTICIPATION OF NEW CASES. I THINK IT'S ONLY TIME IT'S REALLY FAIR AT THIS POINT. TO ANNOUNCE IN FOCUS ON A THREE TIERED CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM INITIATIVE. AND THE FIRST YEAR OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE REFORM INITIATIVE SHOULD BE THAT WE RESTORE COURTHOUSES TO THEIR FULL OPERATING HOURS IN STAFF. THAT WE PROVIDE FAIR COMPENSATION TO OUR CORE FAN. AND ALSO AT THE SECOND PART OF THIS TWO YEAR. I SUGGEST THAT WE EMBRACE THE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE HIGHLIGHTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET WHICH IS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SELF REPRESENTED LITIGANTS. TECHNOLOGY IN TRAFFIC. AND LANGUAGE ACCESS. AND THIRD I THINK WE SHOULD WORK COLLECTIVELY TO DEVELOP AN EMPLOYEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE CALLED FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM LEGAL WAY FINDERS WHO COULD PERSONALLY ASSIST PEOPLE WHO COME TO COURT WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY. WE KNOW THAT WE COULD WORK TOGETHER AND ALSO FIND BEST PRACTICES AND DRAW ON THE WORK OF OUR SELF HELP PROGRAMS AND ARE EXCELLENT VOLUNTEER JUSTICE CORE FOLKS WHO ARE USE NOW IN LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO AND THE BAY AREA. SO WHAT COULD LEGAL WAY FINDERS DO. WELL LEGAL WAY FINDERS CAN MEET PEOPLE AND GUIDED THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE WINDOW APPROPRIATE ROOM COURT ROOM APPROPRIATE COURTHOUSE. A LEGAL WAY FINDER COULD EXPLAIN THE OPTIONS AND THE CONSEQUENCES AND THE PROCEDURES AND FIND THE RIGHT FORUM AND ACTUALLY HELP THE PERSON FILL OUT THE FORM AND GET IT FILED IN THE RIGHT PLACE. LEGAL WAY FINDER COULD PROVIDE REFERRALS FOR SERVICES NOT ONLY IN THE COURTROOM BUT OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. A LEGAL WAY FIND A COULD DO THIS ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS OR IN A WORKSHOP SETTING. AND WE HAVE EXAMPLES FROM WHICH TO DRAW FOR EXAMPLE A JUSTICE CORPS VOLUNTEER THE DAUGHTER OF MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS TELLS US THAT IN HER JOB. SHE HELPS WOMEN IN HER COMMUNITY OBTAIN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS AND SHE HELPS TENANTS WHO ARE NEAR EVICTION. A SELF HELP ATTORNEY IN ALAMEDA TELLS US THAT SHE HELPS PEOPLE FOR ONE DAY AWAY FROM HOMELESSNESS. ANOTHER ATTORNEY TELLS US THAT. WE CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE VALUE OF SELF HELP BECAUSE IT PROVIDES THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR ALL LITIGANTS AND IT HELPS KEEPS THE QUIRK RUNNING EFFECTIVELY. BECAUSE IF THE PAPERWORK ISN'T FILLED OUT PROPERLY ONLY RESULTS IN DELAYS. SO IN CLOSING. I KNOW ALL OF US HERE SUPPORT AFFAIR AND ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN OUR RESIDENTS DESERVE THAT. AND IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT CALIFORNIA BE THE LEADER IN THIS REGARD. ON THE NATIONAL FRONT WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED DISRUPTION ATTACKS ON THE FREE PRESS THREATS TO THE RULE OF CIVILITY THE RULE OF LAW AND JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE BUT. FORTUNATELY. OUR FOUNDERS FOCUSED MUCH ON THE LIMITS OF POWER IN THE CONSTITUTION WHEN THEY CONSTRUCTED THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. THE CHECKS AND BALANCES AS WELL AS ADOPTING THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND BUILDING A FEDERAL SYSTEM THAT STILL RECOGNIZES. THE RIGHTS OF STATES TO GOVERN SOME OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT TO GOVERN ITS OWN AFFAIRS IS NOW BEING LITIGATED IN FEDERAL COURT. SO IT'S ONLY NATURAL THAT NATIONALLY THE LAW DAY THEME THIS YEAR IS SEPARATION OF POWERS. FRAMEWORK FOR FREEDOM. OUR GOVERNOR SAID IN HIS STATE OF THE STATE. THAT FOR CALIFORNIA WE PERSEVERE. AND THE BOULDER WAY IS STILL OUR WAY FORWARD. AND SO I ASK YOU TO HELP TOGETHER TO STAY ON THE BOLD PASS AND PROVIDE FOR FAIR ACCESSIBLE JUSTICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION A REMINDER THAT MEMBERS ARE INVITED TO PERSONALLY MEET AND GREET THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND ASSOCIATE JUSTICES.
