EARLY IN THE MORNING AS YOU CAN SEE WILL HAVE. SO MANY THINGS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MORNING SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING WILL BE ON HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY. IT WILL AND FORMER DECISION MOVIE FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH A VIABLE SOLUTIONS. THAT THAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE FIRE -- WELFARE CRISIS -- SO LAST OCTOBER THIS COMMITTEE HELD A JOINT HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE AT NAPA COLLEGE WIH THE HELP OF THEN. SENATOR GLAZERS SOMEONE AT THE INCOME FOR THAT -- THEIR FOCUS WITH THE RECOVERY EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY SEND PACKED UP BY THE WILD FIRES IN THE YEAR PRECEDING THE HEARING CALIFORNIA HAD ITS TWO LARGEST WILDFIRES IN HISTORY. THE MAN TO SEE -- COMPLEX FIRE AND THE THOMAS FIRES. JUST. A YEAR PRIOR THE TUBS FIRE BECAME THE STATE'S THIRD LARGEST -- WILDFIRES AT THE TIME THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HOW DIFFICULT IN PASSIONATE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE UNDERWHELMING STATE OF RECOVERY IN THAT REGION. INCLUDING PALM THOSE PROBLEMS WITH ADJUSTERS AND CHRONIC UNDER INSURANCE ISSUES. FORTUNATELY A LITTLE OVER A WEEK AFTER THE HEARING ACCOUNTABILITY FIRE STARTED. WELL THE THREE PREVIOUS FAR SHOWED WEAKNESSES IN OUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE MARKET. RESPONSE IN PLANNING THE DEVASTATION OF THE CAMPFIRE EXPOSED SYSTEMATIC WEAKNESSES IN OUR STATES INFRASTRUCTURE AND DISASTER PREPAREDNESS. IT'S STARTING OPEN OUR EYES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF COMMUNITIES BEING DEVASTATED COMPLETELY A KILLED AT LEAST EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE AND DISPLACED 87%. OF THE TOWN OF PARADISE AS A RESULT SHE COULD KEEP GOING OROVILLE HAVE SEEN THE POPULATIONS GO BY 20% EACH. PLACING ADDITIONAL PRESSURES ON PUBLIC SERVICES AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT JOB MARKET AND HOUSING STOCK. THE CAMPFIRE DISASTER HAS ELEVATED THE CONVERSATION ON WILDFIRES THE FACT ON THE STATE MAKING IT A TOP PRIORITY ACROSS A VARIETY OF POLICY AREAS. GOVERNOR NEW SOME CREATED A STRIKE FORCE ALMOST AS SOON AS HE TOOK OFFICE TO STUDY A REPORT ON WILDFIRES INTERPLAY WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY MARKET. LESS THAN A MONTH AGO THE STRIKE TEAM RELEASED THE REPORT AND THE GOVERNOR CALLED ON THE LEGISLATURE TO ACT WITHIN NINETY DAYS TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE HOW E AS A STATE PREVENT AND RESPOND TO WILDFIRES. THE REPORT CALLED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING. SHOULD ALL INSURERS BE OBLIGATED TO OFFER INSURANCE TO HOMEOWNERS LIVING IN THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FOR THE INSURED PERFORMED SPECIFIC WILDFIRE MITIGATION. SHOULD ALL INSURERS BE OBLIGATED TO OFFER REDUCED RATES FOR THOSE HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITY SAID pMITIGATION MEASURES. SHOULD INSURERS BE OBLIGATED TO OFFER CONSUMERS WERE L. INELIGIBLE FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICY EITHER A DIFFERENCE IN CONDITION POLICY OR A PREMISES LIABILITY% POLICY. AS COMPLEMENTARY COVERAGE FOR A FAIR PLAN FIRE POLICY. LASTLY THE CALIFORNIAN SHARON'S GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION POLICY LIMITS HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED FOR A LEAST TWO DECADES. IS IT TIME TO INCREASE THE CURRENT LIMIT OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TO RECOGNIZE THE CURRENT CONSTRUCTION COST. AS A RESULT THE SENATE HOUSE ESTABLISHED SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE WILDFIRE REPORT. OF WHERE TO MYSELF SENATOR JONES FORGES DOT WESSEL MORE LOCK ARE PART OF WE ALL KNOW THAT FIRE SEASON IS ABOUT TO START AGAIN. SO I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ALL OUR PANELISTS TODAY TO BE PART OF THE LARGER CONVERSATION. AS WE HAVE THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I WANT ENCOURAGE ALL OF US.

AND THANK YOU SO MUCH -- FOR ALL OF US ONCE AGAIN FOR BEING HERE I SEE MY VICE CHAIR IS NOT HERE TODAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING THANK YOU SO WITHOUT ONE SHERMAN. IF WE LOOK AT THESE ISSUES -- PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE KEEPS SURFACING ARE ARE WE GOING TO SPEND TIME TODAY.

THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WE'RE GONNA GIVE THE PANELISTS A AN OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS AND ASTOR GOING THROUGH THERE THE PRESENTATION WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK THEM QUESTIONS. SO I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH OUR FIRST PANEL WHICH IS THE INSURANCE REGULATION AND AFFORDABILITY. FOCUS WHICH WILL BE APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MINUTES OR SO OUR FIRST PANEL TODAY'S INSURANCE REGULATION AND AFFORDABILITY WE HAVE JOLT LOCKER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WRECKS FRAZIERFROM THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND MICHAEL MADDOCK OF CONSUMER WATCHDOG THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR BEING HERE. AND JUST A COUPLE OF HOUSEKEEPING RULES WE HAVE THIS ROOM APPROXIMATELY TILL NOON SO THE FIRST PANELIST WILL. GO ON UNTIL AROUND ELEVEN AND OUR SECOND PANEL -- WILL BE GOING ABOUT ELEVEN THIRTY SO THAT WE HAVE TIME TO TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS. THAT WE'D LIKE SO GENTLEMEN PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH -- JEFF AND MR LÃ  [inaudible] WHAT DROUGHT? THANK YOU SIR YOU MAY PROCEED. LOOKS LIKE THIS IS ON I GUESS THE MICROPHONE -- Q. CHAIR SENATOR RUBIO I APPRECIATE YOU INVITING US A I'M HERE REPRESENTING COMMISSIONER LARA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND I APPRECIATE BEING INVITED AND GETTING THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION THAT WE WE WOULD LIKE TO SHARE. IN THE PACKET OF MATERIALS THERE IS A POWER POINT -- THAT I WILL SIMPLY WALK THROUGH TALKING ABOUT SOME BACKGROUND OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. SO I'M GOING TO TURN RIGHT TO THE SECOND PAGE OF THAT DOCUMENT. THERE'S JUST SOME NUMBERS ABOUT HOW MANY HOMES THAT ARE INSURED IN CALIFORNIA. JUST TO KIND OF GIVE A PERSPECTIVE OF THE THE RANGE OF THE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA OVER SIX MILLION HOMES -- THAT HAVE HOMEOWNERS POLICIES. WE DON'T TRACK HOW MANY UNANSWERED HOMES THERE ARE I DON'T HAVE THAT NUMBER. TWO MILLION DWELLING POLICIES. THOSE ARE POLICIES NOT WRITTEN ON A HOMEOWNER'S PACKAGE BUT WRITTEN ON A KIND OF MODEL LINE FIRE. POLICY A MORE LIMITED POLICY WITHOUT LIABILITY COVERAGE. A MILLION CONDOMINIUM POLICIES. FOR THE PEOPLE FOR THEIR OWN UNIT. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND MANUFACTURED HOME POLICIES AND OVER TWO MILLION RENTERS POLICIES SO THAT'S THAT'S GIVES A SCOPE OF OUR INSURANCE MARKET PLACE THERE ARE MORE HOMES THAN THAT OVERALL IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN ON THE NEXT PAGE PAGE. THREE YOU GET A VIEW OF WHAT THEY TOTAL LOSSES INSURED LOSSES HAVE BEEN. FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WILDFIRES. SO TWELVE POINT THREE BILLION IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UNFORTUNATELY FOLLOWED BY AN EVEN LARGER THIRTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION. LOSSES IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NEXT PAGE. PAGE FOUR TURNS THOSE NUMBERS INTO. WHAT THAT MEANS TO INSURERS? EXPERIENCE. FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. WAS TWO HUNDRED AND 1%. A FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO MY KNOWLEDGE THAT IS. LIKELY A RECORD LOSS RATIO FOR INSURERS. IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE YEAR THE OAKLAND HILLS FIRE. THE LOSS RATIO FOR HOMEOWNERS WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 18%. THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS HIGH. UNTIL THIS YEAR. THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO HOMEOWNERS LOSS RATIOS HAVE HOVERED IN THE THIRTIES FORTIES FIFTY PERCENTILE MEANING. FOR EVERY DOLLAR OF BUSINESS THEY RIGHT. THEY MIGHT HAVE A PAID OUT FORTY SOMETHING PERCENT IN CLAIMS DOLLARS. SO IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UNFORTUNATELY FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY WROTE THEY PAID OUT TO DOLLARS IN CLAIMS. IN A GIVES YOU A SENSE HOW THAT. PLAYED OUT FOR DIFFERENT INSURERS THERE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE. THE TWO HUNDRED AND 1% IS THE OVERALL NUMBER BUT FOR STATE FARM IT WAS TWO HUNDRED AND 75% -- FOR FARMERS HUNDRED FORTY NINE SO UNDER THE TWO HUNDRED FOR NATIONWIDE FOUR HUNDRED AND 21%. SO MASSIVE NUMBERS MORE THAN FOUR DOLLARS PAID OUT FOR EVERY -- PREMIUM DOLLAR RECEIVED THAT YEAR [inaudible] SO. OBVIOUSLY. A A TERRIBLE YEAR WE FOLLOW UP IF YOU FLIP THE PAGE. FIVE AND THE NEXT YEAR -- MAJOR LOSSES SLIGHTLY BETTER LOSS RATIO FOR INSURERS BUT STILL. WOULD HAVE BEEN THE RECORD. HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE YEAR BEFORE. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF A A COUPLE ANSWERS AGAIN TRAVELERS AT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO STATE FARM MUCH BETTER YEAR FOR THEM. ALBEIT AN AWFUL YEAR FOR THEM LOS WISE AT 89%. AND JUST TO MENTION AS I MENTIONED THE POLICIES WRITTEN INCLUDED DWELLING FIRE POLICIES. I JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF OUR OWN FAIR PLAN THAT IN SURE -- OF LAST RESORT. WHICH RIGHTS A DWELLING FIRE FORM OF COVERAGE. FOR THE LOSS RATIO FOR DRAWING FIRE COVERAGE REALLY HADN'T EXCEEDED. HADN'T EXCEEDED A 100% IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS. IT WENT UP TO A HUNDRED AND 64%. AND THE FAIR PLANS LOSS RATIO WAS TWO HUNDRED AND 57%. A LOT OF THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCENTRATION. IN THE MALIBU AREA WHERE -- WE HAD COURSE SOME OF OUR MAJOR FIRES. SO -- THE NEXT PICTURE JUST. IN A TO GIVE SOME PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES IS A SOME SCENE FROM THE CAMPFIRE -- IN THAT SCENE YOU SEE -- JUST LAST WEEK COMMISSIONER. LARA LED A ANY I SEE SPONSORED WILD FAR CAN SYMPOSIUM. AND LEAD -- FELLOW COMMISSIONERS FROM UTAH AND WASHINGTON. AND OREGON UP -- TO PARADISE. TO KINDA TO MEET WITH THE TOWN LEADERSHIP -- HERE FROM CONSUMERS AND AND GET A SENSE OF THE LEVEL OF DOES THE DEVASTATION IN THAT AREA THAT YOU REALLY. HE HE DON'T APPRECIATE UNTIL YOU ACTUALLY SEE IT -- LET ME FLIP TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THESE ARE THE CLAIMS ISSUES THAT ARISE AFTER. A WHILE FIRE. UNDER INSURANCE IS THE THEME THAT. YOU CAN YOU HAS BEEN REPEATED SENSE. OF WILDFIRE LOSSES FOR SINCE TWO THOUSAND THREE OR SEVEN DURING. OR MY ENTIRE EXPERIENCE IN NINETY ONE ACTUALLY. ALL THE YEARS I'VE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT EVERY TIME THERE'S BEEN A WILDFIRE THERE'S BEEN AN UNDER INSURANCE ISSUE. AND I I GUESS I JUST POSE TO EVERYBODY HERE -- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW THIS ARISES IS TO THINK OF YOUR OWN HOME OWNER'S POLICY? AND HOW DID THE LIMIT THAT YOU HAVE THERE TODAY. EVOLVE TO BE THERE LIKE WHO CHOSE THAT NUMBER. HOW DID THAT NUMBER? TWO HOWEVER MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT IS. IT HAVE YOU HAD A RECENT INTERACTION WITH YOUR AGENT. IS THAT THE NUMBER THAT SOMEBODY SUGGESTED TEN YEARS AGO AND IT JUST KEPT RENEWING WITH SMALL IN. PLACE IN FACTORS. SO FOR ME MOST INSURANCE THAT I TALKED TO IT IS THE NUMBER THAT CAME FROM THEIR INSURER. AND THAT THEY ACCEPTED THAT NUMBER AND THAT NUMBER HAS MOVED FORWARD. EITHER THROUGH INFLATION OR HOWEVER IN SIR -- SUGGESTED OVER MANY DECADES IN THE MEANTIME IF THEY RENEWED WITH THE SAME ANSWER. SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT YOU CAN HAVE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. OF COURSE AND FOR ANY ONE OF US BECAUSE THE MOST PEOPLE AREN'T TOO THRILLED TO TALK ABOUT INSURANCE OR EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. MOST FOLKS LIKE TO WRITE THAT PREMIUM GRUDGINGLY THE CHECK SEND IT OFF AND NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN. WHICH IS AN ISSUE SINCE IT'S FOR MOST PEOPLE THEIR PRIMARY -- INVESTMENT IN IN YOU KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IN LIFE. SO SO IT IS AN ISSUE THE CONTINUES AND IT IS A IT IS A MAJOR DIFFICULTY FOR PEOPLE WHO OBVIOUSLY WANT TO REBUILD. OR RESTART THEIR LIFE AFTER THEY'VE HAD A TOTAL LOSS LIKE THIS -- I'M HOPING IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS -- WITH SOME LEGISLATION. DEMAND SURGED OCCURS OF COURSE IN THESE -- WILD FOR VINCE THAT IS -- OCCURS BEYOND INSURANCE TO CONTROL BUT INSURANCE POLICIES ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITH AN EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST. COVERAGE THAT IS ON ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. SOME INSURERS MAKE THAT AN OPTIONAL COVERAGE. WE HOPE THAT EVERYONE WITH BY. AT A MINIMUM TWENTY FIVE OR 50% AND EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST TO ADDRESS DEMAND SURGE. OR THE FACT THAT AN ESTIMATE CAN BE AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE OF REPLACEMENT COST. THE OTHER MAJOR COMPLAINT WE GET. IS ABOUT THE INVENTORY PROCESS FOR GETTING YOUR PERSONAL PROPERTY RECOVERY. NONE OF WE WANT TO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT IT BUT ESSENTIALLY TO RECOVER THE CONTENTS COVERAGE UNDER YOUR POLICY. YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A LIST OF EVERY ITEM YOU OWN. AND THE AGE OF THAT ITEM HOW MUCH YOU PAID IN THE CONDITION OF THAT ITEM. THE IN SIR -- WOULD EVALUATE EACH AND EVERY ITEM SEPARATELY. AND THEN DETERMINE AN ACTUAL CASH VALUE A DEPRECIATED VALUE. FOR MOST ITEMS PAY YOU THAT MONEY AND THEN AS YOU REPLACE THE ITEM YOU GET THE REPLACEMENT COST FOR THE ITEM. SO IT IS A PAINSTAKING PROCESS. WHICH IS PARTICULARLY HEIGHTENED WHEN YOU'RE IN THESE SCENARIOS WHERE YOU ARE HAVING TO MOVE MILES AWAY IT'S NOT LIKE A ONE OFF FIRE WHERE YOU CAN FIND A HOME. SOMEWHERE NEARBY BUT YOU ARE MOVING MILES AWAY FREQUENTLY PUTTING YOUR KIDS I DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. ALL KINDS OF ISSUES AND HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. IS EXCRUCIATING IS THE WORD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD USE TO DESCRIBE IT. I WOULD SAY A LOT OF THE INSURERS HAVE BEEN GREAT IN. IN ALLOWING INSERT INSERTS NOT TO HAVE TO DO THE ENTIRE INVENTORY TO GET MAJOR PORTIONS OF THAT. RECOVERY BACK SO INSURERS HAVE WAIVED AS MUCH AS 75% OF THEIR LIMITS AND IN A COUPLE CASES A PEOPLE FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WHICH IS THAT YOU WILL HEAR ABOUT THAT ANY CLAIM HOLDER OF AND YOU GO. TO THIRD TIME LIMITATIONS ON COVERAGES SOME OF THOSE WERE ADDRESSED IN LAST RECENT LEGISLATION. AND THERE ARE OBJECTIONS CURRENTLY TO LAND VALUES BEING DEDUCTED WHEN REPLACING THE HOME AT ANOTHER LOCATION. I WILL SAY IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE. A LAW THAT ALLOWS A PERSON TO TAKE THEIR INSURANCE RECOVERY AND INSISTS THAT CHOOSE TO BUY OR BUILD A HOME AT ANOTHER LOCATION. THAT'LL PROBABLY BE. COME INTO PLAY IN A BIG WAY IN THE PARADISE AREA. BUT IF THE REPLACEMENT COST OF THE HOME IN THE INSURANCE PAYMENT IS. FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THE CONSUMER WANTS TO GO BUY A HOUSE. AND PIECE A LAND ALL TOGETHER THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND SOME IN SERVICE THE DOC THAT LAND VALUE AND SAY NO WE'RE ONLY WE ONLY INSURE THE HOME. A TO GET REPLACEMENT FULL REPLACEMENT COST ON HOME YOU HAVE TO SPEND THAT MUCH ON THE HOME NOT THE LAND AND THE HOME AND THE LA DOT THE LAND VALUE. WHICH ENDS UP ARGUABLY IS A WINDFALL TO THE INSERT -- IF THAT HAPPENS THE PERSON NEVER GETS THE REPLACEMENT COST. SO THERE'S AN ARGUMENT. BOTH WAYS ABOUT WHETHER THAT IS APPROPRIATE BUT IT DOES MAKE MOVING ON MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE CONSUMER. SENSUALLY THEY'D HAVE TO BUY A SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR PROPERTY IF THEY WANTED TO GET THEIR WHOLE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND BACK. WHICH JUST KEEP CREATES KIND OF A IN THE WHOLE PROCESS ITSELF. MANY OF THESE ISSUES ARE WITH THE INSURERS CONTROL OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN THEY COULD ADDRESS THE UNDER INSURANCE ISSUE BY MORE -- ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF REPLACEMENT COST. BY COMPLETE A BETTER EXTENDED REPLACEMENT COST TAKEN LABOR DEAL WITH PERSONAL PROPERTY AS THE CHOOSE. AND THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE LAND ISSUE AS THEY CHOOSE SO THEY CAN BE MORE LIBERAL. THEN THERE ARE THE NO LAW MIGHT REQUIRE OF THEM IF THEY CHOSE TO DO SO. THE BIG ISSUE THAT WE ARE SEEING NOW AS WE DO THESE WILDFIRE WORKSHOPS -- TO HELP CLAIMANTS. IS THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT WE HEAR MORE AND MORE -- IS PARTICULARLY BOTH FROM SANTA ROSA WERE SO MUCH OF THE TOWN WAS DEVASTATED AND THEN. EVEN GREATER DEVASTATION OF COURSE IN PARADISE. AND TO THE EMOTIONAL TRAUMA OF THEIR WHOLE TOWN BEING DEVASTATED. REALLY HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON ON HOW MUCH THEY EVEN WANT TO GO BACK AND TRY TO REBUILD RIGHT SO THEY'RE THEY'RE A LOT THAT'S COMING INTO PLAY. AND NOW THE MORE RECENT CONCERN IS ON THE RENEWAL PROCESS SO PEOPLE WONDERING. AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO KEEP MY COVERAGE OR WILL I BE ABLETO AFFORD COVERAGE IF I REBUILD IN PARADISE FOR EXAMPLE. WILL I BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE COVERAGE FOR THAT NEW A NEWLY REBUILT HOME. AND I WOULD SAY I'D WELCOME IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ALONG THE WAY YOU'RE WELCOME TO INTERRUPT AND I'LL. DO MY BEST TO ANSWER SO -- FEEL FREE TO DO SO. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION. THIS. ABSOLUTELY UNDER INSURANCE -- IS THERE A WHAT. MOTIVATES D. MOTIVATES INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM KEEPING A CLOSER EYEON THAT ANDNOT. ENCOURAGING THEIR CUSTOMERS TO INCREASE THEIR INSURANCE. YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE -- HEY THIS MEANS MORE PREMIUM TO YOU AND CERTAIN COMPANY RIGHT IF YOU INCREASE THE LIMITS. I I I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TWO PARTIES ONE WANTING TO SELL ONE WANTING TO BUY A AS CHEAPLY AS POSSIBLE -- AS I SAID PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE PAYING FOR INSURANCE. AND A SO THEY'LL AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF A TOTAL LOSS IS VERY SMALL. SO YOU KNOW PEOPLE TEND TO WANNA KEEP MINIMIZE THEIR COVERAGE. THE ANSWER -- REALLY IS THE ONE WHO KINDA. MAKES THE FINAL DECISIONS HERE IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO INSURE YOU FOR THAT AMOUNT. AND THE SERVER IS TYPICALLY THE ONE THAT SHARES AN ESTIMATE OF REPLACEMENT COST. GENERATED BY WHATEVER VENDOR THAT THEY CHOOSE TO USE. AND YOU KNOW THE MOST OF THIS DATA I MEAN IT'S AN ERA OF BIG DATA. AND AND ACTUALLY YOU CAN FIND OUT ABOUT MORE DETAILS AMOUNTS ANY HOME ONLINE IF YOU LOOK AT ZILLOW OR TRULIA OR REALTOR DOT COM. SO THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE -- I THINK THE INSERTS WOULD SAY THE INSERT ISN'T GIVING THEM ENOUGH DETAILED INFORMATION TO GET IT RIGHT -- IN CERTAIN CONSUMERS WOULD SAY WOLF YOU KNOW I JUST GETTING THE FACTS AND THEN THEN THAT'S THE NUMBER THEY GAVE ME. BUT HOPEFULLY I THINK IT'S REALLY HOLDING CONSUMERS. TO BUY MORE REALISTIC VALUE IS. A TO ME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ANSWER -- TODAY -- IT IT CREATES A COMPETITION PROBLEM IF ONE IN SIR -- DOES THAT AND THE REST OF THE MARKET DOESN'T. BECAUSE THE IN A LITTLE THEY WILL BE OUT OF WHACK -- PREMIUM WISE TOO EXPENSIVE SO IT REALLY TAKES THE WHOLE MARKET TO KINDA. MOVED FORWARD THE SAME TIME. THE NEXT SLIDE IS -- ACTUALLY ARE MAILED THE CLEANS WORKSHOP. I'M GONNA MENTION SOME OF THE MANY THINGS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE DOES. OF A TO HELP HOMEOWNERS ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID HEAR IT SAYS MALIBU -- COMMISSIONER LARA SET UP A A WORKSHOP BOTH A WELL WE'VE HAD ONE AND SHE CO. WE'VE HAD IN. SANTA ROSA WE HAVE IN A GORE HILLS AND THEN MOST RECENTLY IN MALIBU WHERE WE SET UP ONE ON ONE APPOINTMENTS WITH CONSUMERS. TO COME IN WITH THEIR CLAIMS ISSUES AND TALK TO ONE OF OUR CONSUMERS STAFF. SO THAT'S WHAT THESE PICTURES ARE OF MEETING DIRECTLY WITH CONSUMERS. I WOULD SAY FOR OUR STAFF IT'S ONE OF THE MOST REWARDING -- OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR CAREER WE MOSTLY DEAL THROUGH MAIL AND THE PHONE BUT TO BE THERE IN PERSON AND HEAR FROM THE PERSON DIRECTLY. AND BE ABLE TO ASSIST THEM. AND AND HEAR THEM OUT PERSONALLY. I THINK MEANS A LOT TO THE CONSUMER BESIDES THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS. IT'S JUST COMFORTING AND I WISH WE COULD DO IT EVEN MORE -- SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES WE DEAL WITH. PAGE. TEN JUST SHOWS THE THE COMPLAINTS WE RECEIVE. SOME NUMBERS CLAIMS RATING AND UNDERWRITING. IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND THEN OUR MEDIATION PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE FOR PEOPLE WHO COME TO A WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS AN UNRESOLVABLE DISPUTE OVER. A SETTLEMENT -- YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR RECOVERIES HAVE BEEN PRETTY MASSIVE. FOR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- THROUGH COMPLAINTS HANDLED BY THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE HAVE A STAFF -- WE TAKE. A COMPLAINTS OVER THE PHONE MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY BUT YOU CAN GO ONLINE ANYTIME YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR MATERIALS THROUGH OUR WEB. PORTAL AND YOU KNOW WE ARE THERE TO HELP AND OUR CLAIM SERVICES BUREAU HAS BEEN GREAT IN THAT REGARD. SO ON ALL MOVE FROM THERE PAGE [inaudible] ELEVEN THINGS RIGHT [inaudible] THIS. I THINK ACTUALLY MINE SKIPPED THE PAGE. I SKIPPED A PAGE LIKE THIS GIVE A BATES I SKIP CD I RESPONSE. THE ONE I WANTED TO SAY THE MOST ABOUT THE OUR CHANCE -- TO TELL OUR SERVICES. PM SO -- OBVIOUSLY WHEN THERE'S A FIRE LIKE THIS OF THINGS A LOT OF THINGS HAPPENED STATEWIDE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. FOUR NIGHTS A RESPONSE FROM MANY AGENCY. AND THE FEMA CONSENT BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND STAFF. TO LOCAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS ARE DISASTER RECOVERY CENTERS TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN RESPONDING TAKE A PEOPLE. TO THEIR CONSUMER ISSUES SO WHERE THEY'RE USUALLY WEEKS AT A TIME AND ARE THERE ALL DAY THESE RECOVERY CENTERS LAST INTO THE EVENING. AND WHAT WE ALWAYS STAFF THEM. I MENTIONED WE HAVE THE ONE ON ONE WORKSHOPS -- WILL PROBABLY HAVE MORE THOSE COMING UP IN THE FUTURE -- IT'S IN CHICO WAS A TWO DAY EVENT AND I THINK WE MET WITH OVER FIVE HUNDRED CONSUMERS AT THAT EVENT. OF THE OTHER ONES HAVE BEEN A LITTLE SMALLER ACTUALLY SANTA ROSA IS. HUGE GORE HILLS IN MALIBU WERE A LITTLE SMALLER BUT LOT OF A LOT OF CLEAN IT'S COMING AND LOCAL HOMEOWNERS. AND I THINK. THEY ALL GO AWAY FEELING LIKE THEY GRATEFUL TO HAVE SOMEBODY STEP IN AND HELP THEM. IN SURE -- SEND PERSONNEL TO THOSE ONE ON ONE WORKSHOPS AS WELLTHEY'LL SEND CLAIMS ADJUSTERS SO FREQUENTLY WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE CONSUMER. FROM OUR OFFICER IN TO DEAL WITH AN ADJUSTER -- THE ANSWER SOMETHING THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OUR KIND OF RESOLVE WITH THEIR ADJUSTER OVER THE PHONE OR THROUGH EMAIL. MAYBE -- THIS IN THIS WAY THEY GO SEE SOMEBODY MIGHT BE A SUPERVISOR AND SPEAK TO THEM DIRECTLY. AND I SAY THAT'S BEEN SUPER HELPFUL THAT ONE ON ONE INTERACTION WITH AN INSURANCE ADJUSTER AS WELL. AND IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THERE COULD BE MORE OF THAT. WE ALSO SEND REPRESENTATIVES TO DOZENS OF OF EVENTS FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS FOR THESE FIRES -- OF ALL TYPES OF I THINK I WENT TO SANTA ROSA. TEN TIMES FOR VARIOUS COMMUNITY EVENTS FOR EITHER CLAIMANTS OR PLANNING AND TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE AT AND WE ARE JOINED UNITED POLICY HOLDERS THAT MANY EVENING EVENTS -- I DID ONE MYSELF JUST ABOUT A WEEK AGO -- UP AND SHE CO. I'VE DONE THEM ALSO WITHIN -- IN SANTA ROSA AND ARE WE HAVE -- OUR OTHER DEPUTY COMMISSIONER HAS DONE THOSE AS WELL WE DO WE TRY TO OUT REACH ABSOLUTELY AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND INTERACT WITH EVERY COMMUNITY THE BEST WE CAN. I MENTIONED THE FOR YES MANAGER JUST ON THAT TOPIC A AND I KNOW YOU MENTIONED EMAIL PHONE IN A LOCATION CAN JUST GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF SENSE OF THE LANGUAGE. SUPPORT THAT YOU HAVE THE BARRIERS CAN YOU SPEAK TO TO THE LANGUAGE SUPPORT SPANISH CANTONESE WHATEVER. ALSO THERE IS A NEED FOR I WOULD SAY. I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT HAS BEEN TOO MUCH OF AN ISSUE WE DO HAVE A SPANISH SPEAKING OFFICERS AND THROUGH THE HOT LINE WE ARE ABLE -- TO ADDRESS AN ARRAY OF LANGUAGES AS WE HAVE TRANSLATION SERVICES SO WE DO REACH OUT -- THROUGH OUR OUR IN HOUSE STAFF DIRECTLY WITH ALL LANGUAGES. I DON'T KNOW WE DID HAVE CHINESE SPEAKING I BELIEVE -- AND I'M NOT SURE WAT DIALECT BUT AT AT LEAST ACOUPLE THESE LARGER EVENTS WE DEFINITELY HAVE HAD SPANISH SPEAKING. STAFF AT EVERY EVENT THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE ATTENDED IF THAT'S PART OF YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU YES THANK [inaudible] SOME SO I MENTION OUR HOTLINE OUR WHITE WINE I DIDN'T MENTION THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE SEND OUT ENFORCEMENT STAFF ARE FRAUD OFFICERS OR INVESTIGATORS GO OUT MOSTLY FRAUD. TO MAKE SURE THAT ON LICENSE -- CONTRACTORS AREN'T SHOWING UP -- WE JOIN WITH THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. AND SO HAVE TO ADD TO A POLICE PRESENCE -- IN IN THE AREA. UNFORTUNATELY IN AREAS LIKE PARADISE I UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A LOT OF LOOTING -- THAT'S NOT OUR MAIN ROLE TO PROTECT BUT WE HOPE BY OUR PRESENCE WE HEALTH -- MINIMIZE THAT SOMEWHAT. SO NOW KNOWING AND FLIPPED FORWARD -- TO THE SLIDE THAT SAYS WHAT YOU CONTROL. SO THIS IS THE SLIDE THAT KIND OF REFLECTS THE UNDERWRITING PROCESS OF JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THIS IS PROBABLY YOU MIGHT GET A POSTCARD LIKE THIS FROM YOUR LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT. OF WE WANT EVERY HOMEOWNER TO TAKE ACTION. TO MITIGATE THE RISK AT THEIR HOME SO IS USUALLY A DEFENSIBLE SPACE. APPROACH IS WHAT THIS TALKS ABOUT THAT A CLEAR IT. MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A LADDER OF FLAME THAT CAN MOVE FROM ONE TREE TO THE NEXT. THE NEXT PUSH TO YOUR HOME AND CONTROL WHAT YOU HAVE. THAT'S KIND OF THE OLD SCHOOL. AND IF YOU FLIP TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WHAT THE IS -- FOR CONSIDERS YOU SEE NEW SCHOOL UNDERWRITING. AND THIS ONE DOESN'T HAVE -- THE CIRCLE ON BUT YEARS DOES MINE DOESN'T OKAY. SO GENERALLY WHAT AN INSERT -- LOOKS AT TODAY. IS WELL BEYOND JUST THE SINGLE PROPERTY HAT THEY ARE UNDER WRITING FOR COVERAGE. THEY LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE A TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YARDS OR CONFERENCE AROUND THAT PROPERTY IT MIGHT BE A MILE WIDE CIRCUMFERENCE IF THEY'RE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. WIND OR OTHER ISSUES AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SLOPE THE FUEL LOAD IN TERMS OF BROCHURE TIMBER. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE ACCESS TO THE PROPERTY AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST FILTERS THAT YOUR PROPERTY GOES THROUGH. SO THIS IS A LOOK UP PERIOD GRANITE BAY. THEY MIGHT TAKE AA CIRCLE AROUND SOME PORTION OF THIS AREA. TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT HOME OR NOT. USING A MODEL THAT MIKE SCORE THAT INDIVIDUAL HOME TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THAT OTHER INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW EASY IT IS TO GET THERE AND HOW MUCH RISK THERE IS AROUND THE HOME GENERALLY. IF YOUR HOME DOESN'T GET THROUGH THAT UNDERWRITING FILTER. IT WON'T MATTER IF YOU HAVE DONE EVERYTHING YOU CAN AT YOUR OWN PROPERTY. TO MEDIATE THE RISK. THE NEXT PAGE THIRTEEN ARE THE UNDERWRITING LOSS. PEOPLE ASKED WHY DO YOU. AT THE DEPARTMENT LET THE INSURER NON RENEW ME I'VE BEEN WITH THEM FOR TWENTY YEARS I'VE NEVER HAD A LOSS. NOTHING IS CHANGED HERE AND NOW I'M BEING NON RENEW. WELL THERE ARE VERY FEW LAWS THAT REGULATE INSURANCE OR UNDERWRITING. THEY ARE BASICALLY THAT AN ANSWER -- HAS TO USE. RISK BASED -- DECISION MAKING AND THEY HAVE TO APPLY IT CONSISTENTLY. SO WHEN THEY LOOK AT A RISK THEY CAN'T USE THEIR BIASES THAT ARE UNRELATED TO LOS. I DON'T LIKE THAT GUY -- IS A TROUBLE MAKER IT HAS TO BE ABOUT RISK. SO OF WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MODELS THAT I MENTIONED ON THAT LAST PAGE. IN SERVERS INCORPORATING THAT HAS MADE THEM IT'S A NEW SCREEN THEY DIDN'T PUT THEIR WHOLE BOOK THROUGH TEN YEARS AGO WHEN YOU. CAME ON BOARD AS AN INSURED WITH THEM NOW THEY USE IT AND NOW YOU MIGHT FIND THAT WHILE YOU WERE PERFECTLY FINE RISK. UNDER THEIR UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES OF TEN YEARS AGO TO DATE YOU DON'T MAKE THE CUT. AND SO THEY SEND OUT A NON RENEWAL. TYPICALLY. THEY GO WITH THE MANDATE OF THE FORTY FIVE DAY NOTICE SOME DO A LITTLE LONGER. TELLING YOU. YOU KNOW WHEN THIS POLICY WOULD HAVE WHEN IT EXPIRES ON WHATEVER JULY FIRST. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE RENEWAL COVERAGE WITH OUR COMPANY YOU NEED TO FIND COVERAGE ELSEWHERE JUST A QUICK REMINDER YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES SIR THANK YOU OKAY WELL MOVE ON QUICKLY. SO THEY HAVE TO GIVE THE ANSWERED WITH A SPECIFIC REASON INSERT CAN CONTESTED. BUT BASICALLY THEY ARE THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT STANDS. SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS NEW TOOL AND WITH THE FIRES WE'VE HAVE. BEEN HAVING. GOING TO FLIP -- TO LET'S SEE HERE. CONCERNED GETTING A THE REAL TIME ISSUES WE'RE DEALING WITH. THAT FORTY FIVE DAYS NOTICE I MENTIONED SEEMS UNFAIR TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE IT IS VERY HARD TO IMMEDIATELY FIND NEW COVERAGE TODAY FORTY FIVE DAYS SUFFICE YEARS AGO. TODAY IF THE MARKET. IS OF LESS AVAILABLE TO FOLKS IT IS THEY REALLY HAVE TO SHOP BEYOND THEIR TYPICAL CIRCUMFERENCE OF AGENTS OR A AND THEY NEED TO GO FURTHER AND THAT TAKES LONGER. THERE'S NO STANDARDS SECOND BULLET FOR WHAT WOULD MAKE ME MORE INSURABLE WHAT DO I AIM FOR IF I'M GOING TO MITIGATE MY HOME. BUT WHAT IS IT THAT I NEED TO DO THE HOME HEARTENING BESIDES THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND THEN AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER THE ISSUES WITH THE COVERAGE LIMITS AVAILABLE IN BOTH THE CARE. GUARANTEE ASSOCIATION AND WITH FAIR PLAN. AN ISSUE IS THIS NEW PARADIGM THIS NEW CHANGE OF HOW THINGS ARE UNDERWRITING AND FIRES PROGRESS. THAT'S COUNTY THAT'S CATCHING A LOT OF CITIZENS WHO MOVED TO AN AREA BECAUSE IT WAS LESS EXPENSIVE. MEETS THE INCOME THEY HAD MAYBE THAT'S THE REPORT THEY'VE MOVED TO RETIRE. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN INSURANCE HAS CHANGED THE WORLD HAS CHANGED ON THEM THEY HAVE A FIXED INCOME. THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS NEW PARADIGM OF HOW INSURANCES UNDER RIGHT IS UNDER WRITTEN AND READ IT. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S OCCURRING NEXT SLIDE IS FAIR PLAN GROWTH. I PUT GROWTH IN QUOTES BECAUSE THE FAIR PLAN OVERALL HAS NOT GROWN. IT IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN IN NUMBERS BUT ITIS GROWING IN THOSE WILDFIRE -- URBAN INTERFACE AREAS. SO WHILE IT'S GONE DOWN. FIFTEEN FIFTEEN THOUSAND OVERALL IN THE URBAN AREA IT HAS INCREASED BY ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED HOMES AS OF THE END OF LAST YEAR. IN THE WE WE HAS -- IS REFERENCED. AND THAT'S FOR PEOPLE PRESUMABLY THAT CAN'T FIND COVERAGE. WESLEY LOOKED AT RENEW THEIR POLICY. ALSO AGO QUICKLY HERE THE INSURANCE RATES. NOTE US SENATOR MORE LIKE YOU HAD A QUESTION HERE. THE WAY RATES ARE SET IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A PRIOR APPROVAL PROCESS. INSURERS THAT WANT TO CHANGE THE RATES UP OR DOWN MUST APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND STABILITY SUBMIT A RATE APPLICATION THAT DETAILS. WHY THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE A NEED FOR THAT ST STE? SO THE BASIS FOR MAKING THAT DECISION IS. PRINCIPALLY THEIR LOSS EXPERIENCE FROM THE RECENT PAST SO FOR A LARGE COMPANY LIKE STATE FARM THE PRINCIPLE OF MOTIVATION FOR THE INCREASE. IS GOING TO BE BASED ON THEIR LOSS EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST YEAR. STATE FARM IS SO LARGE AS TO HAVE ONE YEAR OF EXPERIENCE GIVES THEM ENOUGH CREDIBILITY FOR RATE. SO. YOU TAKE THAT LAST YEAR'S EXPERIENCE. AND YOU YOU PROJECT WHETHER YOU THINK NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE LIKE LAST YEAR. OR LESS LIKE IT MORE YOU KNOW MORE LOS LESS LOSS IT'S A PROJECTION THAT IS MADE BY THE ACTUARY LOOKING AT THE TREND SO. THE LOSS RESULTS SO WHEN WHEN THE RATE IS APPROVED. WHATEVER IS APPROVED IF IT'S AN INCREASE. IT IS DISTRIBUTED OVER A SET OF FACTORS. SO IT'S NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY SO. I'LL HAVE ANOTHER SLIDE THAT I THINK SHOWS THIS. IT'S NOT DISTRIBUTED EVENLY IT GOES OUT TO THE HIGHER RISK AREAS WILL ABSORB MORE OF THAT RATE INCREASE. THE OTHER PIECE THAT I MAY BE THE INDUSTRY WILL TALK ABOUT THE THE PAPER TALKS ABOUT. BACKGROUND PAPER IS ABOUT HOW WE DO CATASTROPHE LOSSES. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE USE WE TAKE CATASTROPHES SUCH AS THE CAMPFIRE. WE REMOVE THEM FROM THE INSTRUCTORS LOS EXPERIENCE. SO ALL OF THAT 2100% LOSS RATIO OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN OR THE AND 70% OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT DOESN'T GET LOADED DIRECTLY INTO THE RACE. THE CATASTROPHE LOSSES ARE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR THEIR AVERAGED. OVER A TWENTY PLUS YEAR. TIME FRAME AND THEN AND THEN ADD IT BACK IN AS A FACTOR. SO YOU MULTIPLY THE NON CATASTROPHIC RATES BY A CATASTROPHE FACTOR IT'S COMPLICATED. BUT IT IS A WAY OF ACCOUNTING. FOR CATASTROPHE EVERY YEAR IN THE INSURERS RATES WHETHER THERE IS A CATASTROPHE OR NOT THERE IS A CATASTROPHE LOADING. THAT REFLECTS THEIR AVERAGE CATASTROPHE PAYMENTS CAN I ASK YOU TO WRAP UP YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE THANK AND WRAPPED THEM UP. THIRDLY. I THINK ALL JUST THE I'LL JUST TURN TO SLIDE NINETEEN WHICH IS A FIRE LINE WHILE FIERY FACTORS. IN THAT THIS IS FROM A RATE FILING FROM A GIVEN AND SIR -- AND IT IS AN INTERESTING IT TELLS A BIG STORY JUST IN THAT IT SHOWS ITS CURRENT. FIRE LINE RATE FACTORS SO HOW MUCH DID CHARGES AN INSURED BASED ON THE SCORE FROM THEIR WILDFIRE RISK MODEL. NOW THE SCORE OF WHICH THIS PARTICULAR MODEL USES A SCORE OF ZERO TO THIRTY ZERO BEING NO WILD FIRE RISK. THIRTY EXTREME WILD FIRE RISK AND YOU CAN SEE THE SURCHARGE AND THAT CURRENT FILE FIRE LINE SCORE HOW IT INCREASES BASED ON THE SCORE. AND WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING. TO INCREASE THAT. PRETTY DRAMATICALLY IN THE FINAL PROPOSED FACTOR. SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN AT A SCORE. THIRTY THEY CURRENTLY CHARGE THAT PERSON DOUBLE THE PREMIUM THAT THEY WOULD CHARGE FOR A PERSON IN AN URBAN AREA. WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING TO CHARGE THAT PERSON IS THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD CHARGE IN AN URBAN AREA? IF YOU LOOK OVER TO THE LEFT EARNED EXPOSURES. YOU SEE THAT THE ONLY RIGHT ONE RISK IN THAT A SCORE OF THIRTY AND IN FACT AS YOU LOOK UP THAT TABLE FROM THAT. ONE THEY WRITE VERY FEW RISKS. ANY ANYWHERE ABOVE. A NINE REALLY SO IT'S A VERY SMALL NUMBER. SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN AN INSURER TAKES A RATE INCREASE AND I THINK THERE'S A MENTION OF COMMONLY A SIX POINT 9%. INCREASE. THAT INCREASE IS DISTRIBUTED -- SO THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF THAT RATE INCREASE HAPPENS TO THE PEOPLE AT THESE THIS LEVEL OF SCORE. AND IF IT AT AND THE END STAYS NEUTRAL FOR THE PERSON DOWN AT THAT LOW RISK AREA. AND SO. BETWEEN NON RENEWALS AND RATE INCREASES THIS IS THE REALITY FOR CONSUMERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHICH IN THEIR AREAS AT A THIRTY IN ALMOST EVERY COUNTY IN TE STATE -- THAT THAT THEY'RE FACING FOR THEIR INSURANCE. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO A MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANELIST BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I WILL GIVE ARE A MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AT THE END JUST SO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RESPECTFUL OF ALL THE VISITORS HERE AND THE PANELISTS. SO IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO MISS RACKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. ABOUT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE REGULATION AND AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. BUT ISSUES WITH HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AVAILABILITY WHICH THE NEXT PANEL WILL DISCUSS IN GREATER DEPTH. HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN SEVERAL PAST REGULATORY DECISIONS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THESE POLICY CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. AN ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR DIRECT CONSEQUENCES. AND INSURERS ABILITY TO SERVE COMMUNITIES THREATENED BY WILD FIRE. IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. WHICH HAS A DUAL ROLE. ON THE ONE HAND THE DEPARTMENT IS EMPOWERED TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE RATES. AND CAN EVEN ORDER INSURERS TO REDUCE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED RATES THAT IT BELIEVES HAVE BECOME EXCESSIVE OVERTIME. ON THE OTHER HAND. THE DEPARTMENT. MUST MONITOR SOLVENCY TO ENSURE THAT INSURERS CAN PAY CLAIMS. IN THIS BALANCING ACT IF THE DEPARTMENT RESTRAINTS AND INSURERS RATES TO AGGRESSIVELY. THE PLACES FINANCIAL PRESSURE ON THAT INSURER. WHICH WILL THEN REDUCE EXPOSURE TO HIGHER RISK AREAS. WHERE THEY CANNOT GET ADEQUATE RATE? OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS. THE DEPARTMENT IN CALIFORNIA HAS APPROACHED RATE REGULATION IN A MANNER THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS AS OF TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA HAD THE THIRTY SECOND HIGHEST AVERAGE HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE PREMIUM IN THE COUNTRY. AND WHEN THAT IS ADJUSTED FOR AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IT DROPPED TO FORTY THIRD IN THE COUNTRY. THIS LOWER PREMIUM LEVEL WAS A STARK CHANGE FROM SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER WHEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE CALIFORNIA HAD THE FOURTEENTH HIGHEST AVERAGE PREMIUM. SO DURING THAT PERIOD. THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNERS PREMIUM IN THE NATION INCREASED BY 45%. WHILE IN CALIFORNIA THE AVERAGE INCREASED BY ONLY EIGHT POINT 1%. SO HURRICANE STATES HURRICANE EXPOS STATES SUCH AS LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA NOW HAVE AVERAGE PREMIUMS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT OF CALIFORNIA. SO WITH RESTRAINED RATES THERE'S GENERALLY A MARKET RESPONSE RELATED TO AVAILABILITY. EVEN BEFORE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FIRE SEASON. THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET WAS ALREADY REACTING. ACCORDING TO THE STATE'S FOURTH CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT. THE STATE WIDE NUMBER OF SURPLUS LINE AND FAIR PLAN POLICIES IN HIGH RISK AREAS HAD ALREADY STARTED TO INCREASE BY. TWENTY FOURTEEN WELL BEFORE THE FIRES. AND WHILE THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS WERE SMALL. THE TREND WAS REAL. AND IT WAS FORESEEABLE. AND COULD ACCELERATE FOLLOWING THE MASSIVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN FIRES. WHILE THE ADMITTED MARKET CARRIERS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT RATE INADEQUACY ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND RESIDENTS. IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS HAVE VOICE THE OPPOSITE WITH COMPLAINTS ABOUT HIGH PRICES. AND THIS IS A DISCONNECT WORTH CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC DISCUSSION. WHILE THE GULF STATES HAVE ALREADY HAD A CLIMATE DRIVEN INCREASE IN INSURANCE RATES CALIFORNIA HAS NOT. CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS BUT NOT STATUTES. THIS IS NOT A BROADSIDE AGAINST PROP ONE OF THREE WHICH PERMITS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT -- BUT IT'S A REGULATORY SESSION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO CALIFORNIA REGULATIONS. CONTINUE TO PROHIBIT INSURERS FROM USING CLIMATE CHANGE MODELING AND PRICING. INSTEAD REQUIRE INSURERS TO PREDICT FUTURE LOSSES BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OF LOSSES AS JOE MENTIONED. CALIFORNIA'S RECOGNITION OF A NEW NORMAL DOES NOT YET EXTEND TO INSURANCE RATES. THIS CLIMATE CHANGE RESTRICTION IS ON TOP OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTINUED REGULATORY PRINT PROHIBITION AGAIN THIS IS NOT REQUIRED BY PROP ONE OF THREE ON ALLOWING INSURERS TO INCLUDE THEIR ACTUAL COSTS OF REINSURANCE. IN INSURANCE RATES. AS THE WORLD REINSURANCE MARKET RECOGNIZES CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE RISK AND SEEKS HIGHER PRICES FROM CALIFORNIA INSURERS. CALIFORNIA RATING RULES CONTINUE THE LEGAL FICTION THAT INSURERS TO NOT BUY REINSURANCE. IF INSURANCE CANNOT ACHIEVE RATE ADEQUACY IN HIGH RISK AREAS AVAILABILITY ISSUES COULD WORSEN. AND MEASURES TO FORCE INSURANCE RENEWALS. IN AREAS WITH ANADEQUATE RATES. OBVIOUSLY RISK SHUTTING DOWN THE NEW BUSINESS MARKET ENTIRELY BECAUSE FEW INSURERS WOULD LIKELY RISK ENTERING INTO NEW CONTRACTS WITH INDEFINITE DURATIONS. WHEN THEY'RE GONNA BE SUSTAINING A LOS? DURING LAST YEAR'S HECTIC DEBATE ABOUT UTILITY COSTS WILD FIRES FEW HAD TIME TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES ALREADY PRESENT IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AND WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THIS COMMITTEE'S WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE THE COMPLICATED AND COMPETING INTERESTS. AND THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU [inaudible] IS. TO MICHAEL MADIGAN. THANK YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU IT'S MY PLEASURE -- MADAM MEMBERS MIGHT MATTER COUNSEL FOR CONSUMER WATCHDOG. THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION TO BE HERE TODAY MY MY REASONABLY BRIEF PRESENTATION IS IN THREE PARTS USUALLY WILL I'M SMILING ABOUT BEING HERE WE USUALLY DON'T GET INVITED TO AFTER THE PARTY'S OVER SO WE APPRECIATE COMING. IF THE THREE PARTS ARE OF BONE. WHAT IS CONSUMER WATCHDOG HOW PROP ONE OF THREE IMPACTS THE ISSUES BEFORE US AND THE WATCHDOG SUGGESTIONS? CONSUMER WATCHDOG THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROVIDING EFFECTIVE VOICE FOR TAXPAYERS AND CONSUMERS. IN AN ERA WHEN SPECIAL INTERESTS DOMINATE PUBLIC DISCOURSE. GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CALIFORNIA'S REVOLTED AGAINST EXCESSIVE AUTO HOMEOWNERS AND BUSINESS INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND PASS PROP ONE OF THREE IT WAS A BALLOT MEASURE WRITTEN BY -- THE FOUNDER OF CONSUMER WATCHDOG HARVEY ROSENFELD A TO REIN IN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES USING THE PROVISIONS OF PROP ONE OF THREE CONSUMER WATCHING AS LOWER RATES AND SAVE CALIFORNIANS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. CALIFORNIA USED TO BE THE WILD WEST WHEN IT CAME TO INSURANCE SAYS CALIFORNIANS HAD TO BUY INSURANCE INSURANCE COMPANIES WERE ABLE TO CHARGE WHATEVER THEY CAN GET AWAY WITH. IN ESSENCE THERE WAS AN OF INEFFECTIVE SHARE OF UNTIL PROP ONE OF THREE CAME TO TOWN. PROBABLY NOT THREE LOWERED RATES IT SAID INSURANCE COMPANIES HAD OPEN THEIR BOOKS. FULLY DISCLOSING JUSTIFY WHAT THEY CHARGE CONSUMERS AND THEY CAN'T USE MONEY FOR EXTRA ON REASONABLE EXPENSES THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD LIKE TO PASS THROUGH THE CONSUMERS. ANOTHER PROP ONE OF THREE CONSUMERS HAVE RIGHTS AND POWERS LIKE THE RIGHT TO A PUBLIC HEARING CHALLENGE INSURANCE COMPANIES RATES. AND EVEN TAKING THEM TO COURT FOR VIOLATING THOSE RIGHTS. PROBLEM THREE MADE THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN ELECTED OFFICE THAT HAS THE ANSWER TO THE PUBLIC. AS DO YOU GUYS. THERE ARE TYPES OF INSURANCE A REGULAR PROBLEM OR TWO BUT PERSONALAUTOMOBILE TO ONLY FIRE EARTHQUAKE HOMEOWNERS AND A WHOLE BOATLOAD OF STUFF I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE. IN THE MARINES AND GO ASK AND FIDELITY ALL THAT STUFF. BUT ALSO HAVE THEM MELHAM MEDICAL MALPRACTICE MULTI PERIL AND UNITED STATES LONGSHOREMEN AND HARBOR WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE ELEMENTS OF PROP ONE OF THREE OUR PRIOR APPROVAL. REASONABLE NOT EXCESSIVE LOWER RATES TRANSPARENCY AND AN INTERVIEW TO PROCESS. PROP ONE OR THREE REQUIRES AS WAS MAGICALLY PRIOR APPROVAL CALIFORNIA'S DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BEFORE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN RAISE OUR AUTOMOBILE AND HOMEOWNER'S COUNTY INSURANCE RATES. UNLIKE OUR HEALTH PREMIUMS LIKE MINE WENT UP 30% THIS YEAR FOR MY FAMILY AND WHY THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY CAN. THEY CAN'T BECAUSE HEALTH INSURANCE IS NOT COVERED BY PROPERTY PRIOR APPROVAL. TRANSPARENCY AND WIENER INTERVENOR PROVISIONS. AUTO HOME AND BUSINESS YOURS CANNOT BE EXCESSIVE. RATES DETERMINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY AND INSURANCE COMPANY COLLECT FOR EACH KIND OF COVERAGE THEY SELL. INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO CHARGE RATES THAT ARE NOT EXCESSIVE IN LIHT OF THE PROFITS INVESTMENT INCOME. THE EXPENSES THEY PASSED THROUGH IN THE RATES THEY CHARGE MUST BE REASONABLE. AND IMPROPER THREE HAS AN INTERVENING PROCESS. PROBLEM THREE AUTHORIZED CONSUMER PARTICIPATION IN THE ADMINISTRATION. OF INSURANCE RATES. THE PERMANENT CONSUMER INTERVENOR TO RECOVER ADVOCACY EXPERT FEES AND EXPENSES UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. PROP ONE OF THREE HAS SAVE CONSUMERS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IN YOUR PACKET THERE'S A THERE'S A NICE GRAPHICS GOT THINGS COLORS IT SHOWS THAT -- WE HAVE SAVED OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS A HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO CONSUMERS. AND DURING THE 200-022-0062 THOUSAND SIXTEEN CONSUMER WATCHED A GREAT CHALLENGE SAVINGS. OR NINETY SIX PLUS MILLION FOR MED MALLON BUSINESS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FOR TOTAL HOMEOWNER SAVINGS. ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION FOR TO A LOT OF SAVINGS FOR COMBINED SAVINGS OF THREE POINT TWO EIGHT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. IN ADDITION TO THE SAVINGS ACHIEVED IN A CALIFORNIA'S CONSUMER PROTECTION SYSTEM. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SYSTEM OF STRONG REGULATION. OF THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AS FOSTERED A ROBUST AND CAN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE MARKET. HELPING CALIFORNIA TO BECOME THE SECOND LEAST CONCENTRATED AUTO INSURANCE MARKETS IN THE NATION. WELL EFFECTIVE REGULATION WILL ALLOW FOR REASONABLE PROFITS HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE ENJOYED AN AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURN ON THAT WORTH OF FOURTEEN POINT 1%. COMPARED WITH THE NAY POINT 5% ANNUAL AVERAGE NATIONALLY. EVEN INCLUDING THE MASSIVE LOSSES INCURRED BY THE ANOMALOUS PGA ANY NEGLIGENCE ASSISTED YEAR OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA RETURN ON NET WORTH DROPPED TO RESPECTABLE SEVEN POINT 1% [inaudible] PART. TWO THE ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. IT SURE IS COME TO CALIFORNIA ARE ACTUALLY FACING AN UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURES ON THEIR ABILITY TO WRITE INSURANCE POLICIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. DUE TO THE INCREASE IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY WILDFIRES. THAT IS EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY MAY BE GROUPED INTO UNDERWRITING RISKS. AND REST TO THE ASSETSTHAT THE TEACHERS DEVELOP TO FUND LOSSES AND TO PROVIDE RETURN ON INVESTORS. ON THE INVESTMENT SIDE OF THE BUSINESS NSURANCE ARREST TO THE VALUE OF FOSSIL FUEL RELATED ASSETS CONSTITUTES TRANSNATIONAL RISKS. TRANSITION RISKS OF INSURERS INVESTMENTS IN FOSSIL FOR RELATED ENTITIES. ARE THE FINANCIAL RISKS INCLUDING INVESTMENT LOSSES. TO INSURERS AS THE WORLD DRASTICALLY REDUCES THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS. THE INVESTMENT IN UNDERWRITING FOSSIL FUEL RELATED ENTITIES ARE PROJECTS BY THE INSURANCES STIRS INDUSTRY. ARE CAUSALLY RELATED TO THE EXACERBATIONS CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT IS WHY WE RECENTLY SUBMITTED A PETITION THE COMMISSION A LARA TO ISSUES SOLVENCY. TO ENSURE THE SOLVENCY OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND PROTECT CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE WANTED THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO DISCLOSE ALL THEIR INVESTMENTS IN FOSSIL FUEL RELATED ENTITIES. AND THE FOSSA FOR RELATED COMPANIES AND PROJECTS THAT THE UNDER RIGHT OR OTHERWISE INJURE. THE IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE A WEATHER RELATED EVENTS WEATHER RELATED EVENTS BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE NATURAL DISASTERS. AND THEIR COSTS IN ANAVERAGE YEAR. IN TWENTY SEVENTY RECORD BREAKING GLOBAL COSTS. FOR SUCH EVENTS WERE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY BILLION. THE VAST MAJORITY IS THE IMPACTS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE TUBS FIRE IN NAPA VALLEY WAS A COST AS WELL FARM THE GLOBAL INSURANCE INDUSTRY'S HISTORY. AND THE LARGEST IRVINE CONFLAGRATION. THESE TRENDS ALSO ESTABLISH A NEXUS BETWEEN INTENSIFYING HAZARDS AND CONSUMERS WHO CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS OR THAT WE AREAS. THE RESULTS ARE MATERIAL FOR PROPERTY INSURERS GLOBAL LOSSES IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN REDUCE THAN THAT RETURN ON NET WORTH FROM LET'S GET PRIDE THROUGH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY SINCE TROLL TOOK UP ALL OF OUR TIME. YOU'RE WELCOME AND YOU HAVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND HAVE TO SAY THAT WE NEED TO REMAIN VIGILANT TO INSURANCE COME WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE MUST REGULATE UP FRONT. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT. EVEN THE FACT THAT THE V.. PERSIST ON NOT WISHING TO HAVE LIMITS ON THEIR CONTACT AND LOBBY AGAINST TRANSPARENCY. RATHER THAN EXPAND TRANSPARENCY IN THE REDDIT CONSUMERS. SO WHAT'S THE SOLUTION LET'S JUST GET TO THE SOLUTION AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHICH RECEIVE INCREASE COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE WILL WE IS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. AND IF AVAILABLE IS ON AFFORDABLE TO MANY THAT NEED. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WILL VOLUNTARY AGREE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO CHANGE ITS CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICE. OR HOW IT USES CERTAIN DECISION MAKING TOOLS. RELYING ON VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY CHANGES IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY TO RESULT IN ANY SOLUTION THAT BENEFITS CONSUMERS. HOMEOWNERS ARE ALSO COMPLAINING THAT THEIR INSURERS HAS INCREASED THEIR PREMIUMS DUE TO THE REAL OR PERCEIVED WILDFIRE RISK. CDI HAS REVIEWED CASES WERE HOMEOWNERS ARE PAYING AN ANNUAL PREMIUMS OF EIGHT HUNDRED TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT UPON RENEWAL SAW INCREASES TO AS HIGH AS TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND SOME OF THESE HOMEOWNERS HAVE. CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE AND COSTLY DEFENSIBLE SPACE ANOTHER MEDICATION LIKE THE ONE BEFORE YOU RIGHT NOW. BUT THESE ACTIONS DID NOT LOWER PREMIUMS WHILE AN INHERENT RISK OF WILDFIRES IN CERTAIN AREAS INCREASES THE COST OF A HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE POLICY. THERE ARE CHANGES THAT CAN BE ENACTED TO LESSEN THE SEVERITY OF THESE HIGH PREMIUM INCREASES. I PROPERTY INSURED UNDER A POLICY OF RESIDENTIAL. PROPERTY INJURES IS ELIGIBLE FOR A PREMIUM CREDIT AS COMPARED TO OTHER SIMILARLY GEN AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE CRITERIA FOR OFFERING ISSUING AND RENEWING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. OWNER SHOULD ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO FRAUD TO A FUND OR GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TOWARD THE MITIGATION. SIMILAR TO WHAT ALABAMA OFFERS ITS CITIZENS. SO HERE THE MAIN IDEAS TO CONSIDER. INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD NOT CANCEL OR NOT RENEW A POLICY BASED ON WEATHER RELATED CLAIMS OR CERTAIN NUMBER OF CLAIMS IN THE SPECIFIC SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD OR FOLLOWING A DECLARED DISASTER. INSURANCE COMPANY SHOULD NOT CANCEL OR RENEW A POLICY THAT HAS BEEN IN EFFECT FOR A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD UNLESS A STRICT RECISION STANDARD IS MATT. INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER BEFORE THEY CAN REDUCE THE VOLUME OF POLICIES IN A GIVEN AREA. AND INSURANCE COMPANIES MUST PROVIDE MITIGATION DISCOUNTS AND CONTINUE COVERAGE TO INSURERS TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN HARDENING THEIR HOMES I KNOW ONE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT DOES THAT WORK FOR IT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS AND WHEN YOU DO THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND YOU LIVE IN A FAR WISE COMMUNITY THEY WILL GIVE YOU THAT DISCOUNT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE YOU. INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OFFER HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE IN THAT THE WILDLIFE. WILDFIRE URBAN. THE WE WE THANK IF THE INSURED CONDUCTS SPECIFIC WILD FIRE MITIGATION. INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD OFFER A MITIGATION PREMIUM CREDIT FOR THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO CONDUCT PROPER MITIGATION. THE CDI SHOULD NOT ALLOW THE USE OF THE BLACK BOX WILD VIRUS MODELS. ANY WILD VIRUS MODELS USED IN RATING OR UNDERWRITING MINCED MUST NOT BE TREATED AS A PROPRIETARY BLACK BOX. IT MUST HAVE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE CD I MUST BE TRANSPARENT AND MUST BE SUBJECT TO PROPER THREE INTERVENTION AND CHALLENGE. CD I MUST REQUIRE AN APPEAL PROCESS BEFORE THE ADVERSE DECISION IS FINALIZED ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RATES IN PREMIUMS ARE ADEQUATE. AND NOT EXCESSIVE FOR THE WILD VIRUS. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SHOULD QUIT PASSING THROUGH ALL THE COST TO CONSUMERS WHETHER IT'S FROM P. JEANNIE DISASTER OR FROM WILDFIRES. TO CONSUMERS. THEY SHOULD CREATE A FINDER GRANT PROGRAM TO GIVE HOMEOWNERS IN EXCESS OF UP TO ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO HELP MITIGATE WHILE FIRE EXPLOSION HARDEN THEIR HOMES IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE OR MAINTAIN THEIR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE OR RECEIVER PREMIUM DISCOUNTS. FOR CRYING OUT LOUD ALABAMA DOES THAT. I COULD USE IT I HAVE A TWELVE BEAUTIFUL. HUNDRED TWENTY FOOT REDWOOD TREES THAT GOT THE BEETLE BY. THAT HAS TO COME DOWN. THAT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M GONNA GO CRACK MY KIDS PIGGY BANK TO GET THAT DONE IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THAT FUND SO FINALLY. INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A WAY TO GET THE CAMEL'S NOSE UNDER THE PROTECTIVE PROP ONE OF THREE TENT. ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY ARE PART OF THE REASON CLIMATE CHANGES EXACERBATING THE RISKS THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO ENSURE. HISTORICAL DATA IS WORKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK JUST FINE. INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS MASSIVE AND PROFITABLE CALIFORNIA ASSURANCE MARKET. THEY DIDN'T MALPRACTICE INSURERS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE MINUTE THEY LEFT THE STATE THE NEXT DAY THERE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MALPRACTICE INSURERS DOING QUITE WELL RIGHT NOW SO. FOR THAT I JUST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU BEING HERE AT THIS POINT I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR MEMBERS STYLE QUESTIONS ANYONE HAVING ANY QUESTIONS. WE WILL WAIT FOR MR. SENATOR TO TAKE A SEAT. THANK YOU SURE I I WISH I HAD A DIME FOR EVERY TIME I FOR THAT -- I HAD HOW DID YOU. COME TO THE AMOUNTS THAT YOU PROVIDED HAD OUT HOW WOULD I VERIFY THESE SAVINGS. YOU COULD GO WITH THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA THEY HAVE THAT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT -- CALCULATED THAT -- A LOT OF THOSE SAVINGS ARE -- TAKEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA CDI -- THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE INFORMATION THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEN WE HAVE IT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG. USE THE TERM OF THE SECOND LEAST CONCENTRATED STATE COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE -- I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN THERE TO THE THE IDEA THAT THERE IS -- THE COMPETITION. THE ISSUE IS THAT WE HAVE AN EXTREME -- HIGH LEVEL OF COMPETITION THEY WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT CONCENTRATED INTO A COUPLE OF COMPANIES AS ARE IN OTHER STATES SUCH AS FLORIDA. TEXAS. AND AND WHY WOULD THAT BE. WHY WHY WOULD WE HAVE SO MUCH COMPETITION WHEN WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT REGULATED? INDUSTRY NOW WELL GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN AND OF ITSELF IS A GOOD THING IN FINANCIAL MARKETS SPECIALLY FINANCIAL MARKET IS THE FIFTH LARGEST IN THE WORLD COST NSURANCE -- AND THE IDEA THAT YOU HAVE A PRETTY GOOD A REFEREE BLOW AND THE A CALLING THE BALLS AND STRIKES IS IMPORTANT AND WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WANTS MORE THAN ANYTHING EVEN WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMIT AND SELF. IS CERTAINTY. THEY WANT HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THEY WANT CERTAINTY TO COMPETE ON A LEVEL BASIS WITH EVERYBODY ELSE. AND PROP ONE OF THREE PROVIDES THAT. THE ACTUAL DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION ALLOWS THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO HELP INSURANCE COMPANIES DO THE BEST THEY CAN. HAVING BEEN ON BOTH SIDES OF THE THE THE THE EQUATION HERE AS AN INSURANCE EXECUTIVE AND NOW IT'S A CONSUMER ADVOCATE. I CAN SAY THAT INSURANCE INDUSTRY HIGHER EXISTS EXTREMELY -- THOSE OF THE GENTLEMAN TO MY LEFT -- MISTER FRASIER'S EXTREMELY TALENTED AND SMART PEOPLE. AND THEY ARE ALSO ALSO THINK SOMETIMES THAT DAY NO MORE THAN THE REGULATOR AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY DO. THE REGULATOR HAS TO PLAY CATCH UP ALL THE TIMES TO THESE REAL SMART INSURANCE EXECUTIVES AND ATTORNEYS. AND TO DO THE PROPERLY THEY HAVE TO HAVE P FRONT REGULATION MEANING EVERYTHING HAS TO BE COMPLETELY SET FORTH RIGHT UP FRONT. THAT'S A PROBLEM -- THREE THIS PROBLEM WITH THE SAYS WHATEVER IT IS YOU GOT TO SHOW US YOU WANNA RAISE PREMIUMS FINE SHOW US. DO IT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS THE EXACT RULES AND REGULATIONS THEY KNEW TO FOLLOW AND THEY DO A QUITE WELL IN A RIDICULOUSLY DIFFICULT. AND AND BUSY MARKET THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE MARKETS. SO ON ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO OF OUR REPORT IT STATES IN THE LAST SENTENCE. CALIFORNIA'S RATE MAKING SYSTEM HAS NOT UNDERGONE SOME OF THE RADICAL CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY. RIGHT WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN. IT IS THE TEXAS NGUYEN PROBLEM -- THE FLORIDA HURRICANE DISASTER PROBLEM CALIFORNIA HAS A KICK SOME SERIOUS ISSUES THAT WILD FIRES IS GOT EARTHQUAKES CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THAT I KNOW ISSUES OF COME RECENTLY BEFORE YOU -- AND THE HIT THE PURPOSE OF THE HIGHLY REGULATING AND MONITORING WHAT GOES ON JUST LIKE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN OUR IN THE CRASH IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHERE ARE THE FINANCIAL MARKETS TOOK A TUMBLE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY DIDN'T. THE INSURANCE INITIALLY DIDN'T TUMBLE BECAUSE OF THE MCCARRON FERGUSON ACT WHICH REQUIRES STATES TO REGULATE NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO REGULATE. AND THE LOCAL REGULATION BEHIND ELECTED INSURANCE COMMISSIONER KEEPS THEM ON THEIR TOES AND ARE ABLE TO REGULATE AND PAY MORE ATTENTION. THANK YOU WELCOME SIR -- MISTER WALKER -- ON PAGE -- SEVENTEEN YOU HAVE AN EXAMPLE THE FAIR PLAN RATE INCREASE AND IT HAS A TWENTY POINT 1%. INCREASE APPROVED -- THAT EXCEED WELL FIRST AN ANSWER -- ANY ANSWER CAN OF CAN FILE FOR GREATER THAN 7%. THEY JUST TAKE -- THE THERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH AS CONSUMER WATCHDOG. TO CHALLENGE THAT RATE INCREASE AND IF A HEARING IS REQUESTED IT DOES HAVE TO GO TO HEARING. IF IT IS GREATER THAN A 7% INCREASE SO ANY ANY COMPANY CAN FILE FOR THAT. THE FAIR PLAN IS NOT. A PROP ONE OF THREE SUBJECT ENTITY THEY'RE NOT. AN ANSWER -- AND AND UNDER THAT DEFINITION SO THEY FILE. FOR WHATEVER THEY THINK THEY NEED. AND THE THE POINT OF THAT OF COURSE IS. TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY TOOK A 20% INCREASE. THERE WERE CONSUMERS AND URBAN BOOK OF BUSINESS WHICH IS. THE MAJORITY OF THEIR BUSINESS GOT A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT RAPE IS DISTRIBUTED. IN PEOPLE IN THAT MOVIE THEY GOT SIGNIFY RATE INCREASES SO IT'S YEAH THAT'S IN THE AGGREGATE OR NOT KIDS 20% IN THE CRICKET THANKS MISTER FRAZIER YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF BEING BRIGHT. DON'T LISTEN TO EMERGE. I DIDN'T HEAR HANDSOME BUT I COULD THROW THAT IN -- YOU FOR A YOU USED A LOT OF INTERESTING TERMS IN YOUR PRESENTATION -- RESTRAINED RATES [inaudible] GREAT INADEQUACY. CLIMATE RATE INCREASES -- PROVIDED IN OTHER STATES. CLIMATE CHANGE PRICING AND YOU CAN ONLY RAISE RATES BASED ON TWENTY YEAR TREND SINCE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A TWO YEAR TREND IT'S AWFUL RATE -- SO I I'M BUT BUT THE THING YOU DID DID YOU SAID IT'S AN ARMATURE THAT KIND OF POPS OUT TO ME THE MOST AND I LIKE YOU. TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE AS WE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR RE INSURANCE AND AND COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE WHY. IS THAT THE CASE. WHAT'S A POLICY CHOICE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN. WHAT I HOPE TO CONVEY IN MY COMMENTS IS? BLEACHER INTO HISTORY POSITION ISN'T THAT PROP ON A THREE IS GOOD OR BAD IT'S OBVIOUSLY AND HOW. THE REGULATOR CHOOSES TO IMPLEMENT PROP ONE OF THREE AND THE REGULATIONS PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT TO IMPLEMENT PROP ONE OH THREE AND IT'S JUST A COMPLICATED BUNDLE OF CHOICES. AND SO IN THE THREE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS YOU'VE GOT UNDERWRITING RATING AND CLAIMS AND DID YOU HEAR MOST OF THE POLICY PROPOSALS ARE LET'S MAKE CLAIMS BE PAID MORE. LET'S RESTRICT UNDERWRITING SO THAT WE HAVE IT'S HARDER TO NON RENEW AND YOU JUST HAVE TO SORT OF TAKE EVERYBODY WITH NO REAL CONNECTION TO THE THIRD ELEMENT WHICH IS RIGHT. RIGHT IT'S EASY TO SAY TAKE EVERYBODY PAY HIGHER CLAIMS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND NOT LET THEM CHARGE ENOUGH. AND NOT SUSTAINABLE TO LET'S NOT RIGHT. AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS CHOSEN IT'S NOT REQUIRED BY PROPOSITION ONE OF THREE BUT DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS CHOSEN. TO APPROACH THE RATE MAKING AS A FREE INSURANCE IS NOT A PART OF DECISION MAKING FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES. AND INSURANCE COMPANIES IN REALITY DO USE REINSURANCE IN THE USE IT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES THAT USE IT SO THEY CAN PRODUCE NEW BUSINESS THEY DON'T HAVE TO TELL THEIR AGENTS. OPERATIC CAPITAL WE CAN'T PRODUCE ANY MORE BUSINESS SO SORRY -- YOU CAN'T WRITE ANYMORE YOU CAN'T ERNIE INNER EARNING MORE COMMISSION RIGHT SO WE INSURANCE ISN'T ACCEPTED REGULAR PART. OF THE INSURANCE MARKET NOW THE POLICY CONCERN OF THE DEPARTMENT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHICH IS PROP ONE OF THE THREE SUBJECTS INSURANCE COMPANY RATES TO PRIOR APPROVAL BUT IT DOESN'T SUBJECT RE INSURANCE. RATES TO PRIOR APPROVAL SO THE FEAR HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELL IF WE ALLOW THE UNDERLYING COST INCREASES OF REINSURANCE TO BE PASSED ALONG. THEN THAT'S SORT OF A WAY TO GET AROUND THE PROP ON A THREE RATE CONTROLS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THEORETICAL CONCEPT BUT THERE'S A PRICE TO BE PAID. BECAUSE AS THE WORLD US DOWN LOOKING A CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES THAT THEY GET. THE NEW NORMAL WHEN THEY SEE THESE GIGANTIC LOSSES AND THEY'RE EXPERIENCING GIGANTIC LOSSES AROUND THE WORLD. DO YOU THINK THE REINSURANCE WORLD OF SAYING HEY I GOT A HUGE APPETITE FOR CALIFORNIA AND I REALLY REALLY WANT. TO GIVE GREAT DEALS TO THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS THERE THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. THEY ARE -- INCREASING THEIR PRICES INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT SEVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES REINSURANCE COSTS GO UP 30% GUESS WHAT. THEY HAVE NO WAY TO FUND THAT EXCEPT JUST OUT OF PROFITABILITY. AND SO THEY THEN HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WELL. IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RATE COMING IN. THEN WHAT DO WE DO WE CAN'T PAY LOWER WE CAN'T BE HARDER ON CLAIMS THAT'S NOT A RIGHT WAY TO DO IT RIGHT SO THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PART OF THE BUSINESS AND THAT'S UNDERWRITING. AND IF YOU CAN'T GET ENOUGH PRICE YOU HAVE TO START FIGURING OUT HOW DO I. D. LEVERAGE MY BOOK IN A WAY TO REDUCE THE AVERAGE RISK IN THE BOOK OF BUSINESS. AND THAT'S A STERILE WAY OF SAYING HOW DO I SAY NO TO MORE PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO READ NON RENEW MORE PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO NOT WRITE AS MUCH NEW BUSINESS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT AREAS WHERE YOU CAN'T GET STATE APPROVAL. TO CHARGE AN ADEQUATE RATE. AND SO IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE A GENERAL COMPLAINT ABOUT. THE DEPARTMENT AND CONSUMER WATCHDOG APPROACH ON RATES IT'S FINE IF THEY WANT TO TO TAKE THE POSITION THEY'VE TAKEN IN COURT. WHICH HAS BEEN. THEY WANT CALIFORNIA INSURANCE RATES FOR THE ADMITTED MARKET. CONFESS KATORI RATE UNDER THE TAKINGS CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION. THEIR POLICY POSITION IS THEY WANT RATES TO BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLY THEY CAN BE WITHOUT IT BEING A TAKING. OKAY. THAT'S FINE THAT'S THEIR LEGAL POSITION BUT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCE TO THAT AND THAT'S THE FRUSTRATING PART IS THAT THEY DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONSEQUENCE. OF THE PREDICTABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR POLICY CHOICE THE POLICY CHOICES TO PUSH RATES DOWN. BUT THEN THEY SAY WELL THAT'S NOT RIGHT OH BY THE WAY PAY MORE IN CLAIMS WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED OR FEWER QUESTIONS AND BY THE WAY YOU HAVE TO SAY YES TO EVERYBODY OKAY SO AT SOME POINT. WHEN YOU YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TALKING? JOE HOW OFTEN PUBLIC. AND SO IT'S JUST A POLICY CHOICE. AND COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN THEY ACHIEVE. THE ABILITY TO OPERATE -- THE END IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE RESULTS ARE IN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE CENTURY ON A DIRECT BASIS. PURSES ON A NET BASIS WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET TO LOOK AT REINSURANCE. WELL THEY'RE QUITE A DIFFERENT PICTURE. OKAY THE DEPARTMENTS A IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP ON A THREE WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE IN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THE CENTURY. THAT INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE MADE MONEY. ON OTHER CA AND THEIR COMBINED RATIO BECAUSE THEIR COMBINED RATIO OVER THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS IS ABOUT. NINETY NINE POINT 6%. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT ACTUALLY THEIR INSURANCE PREMIUMS THEY PAID VERSUS THE REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES THAT THEY RECEIVED IT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY WITH A LOSS IN THE FIRST EIGHTEEN YEARS OF ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. SO IT IS -- THE OTHERS JUST AT A DISCONNECT THAT WE THINK. WE OUGHT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT BUT THEN MISTER WALKER HOW COME THE INSURANCE -- FOR EARTHQUAKES ALLOWS FOR CHARGING. FOR REINSURANCE AND WE HAD THAT DISCUSSION [inaudible] JUST RECENTLY. YES SO OBVIOUSLY. INSURERS DON'T WRITE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA JUST BECAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD ON THE RESUME THEY ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY AND I'M SURPRISED TO HEAR THEY'VE NEVER MADE MONEY. BUT THIS IS JUST OUT OF THEIR GENEROSITY -- MAYBE THEY WOULD BE HERE I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE -- EARTHQUAKE A FOUR EARTHQUAKE IN MED NOW THERE IS A REINSURANCE COMPONENT. UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE VERY SPECIALIZED COVERAGES SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. AUTO OR HOME OR COMMERCIAL TYPE PERIL. SLICE COVERAGE WITH QUICK ALMOST NEVER HAS A LOSS UNTIL IT DOES RIGHT AND THEN IT IS A BIG. ONE AND SO -- THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT PLAY INTO THAT. ABILITY TO CHARGE A PREMIUM FOR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE THERE'D LEVERAGE FACTOR ARE THE PROFIT MAKING ABILITY IS DIMINISHED BECAUSE OF THAT REINSURANCE LOAD SO IT ISN'T LIKE A FREE RIDE FOR EARTHQUAKE. AND MET MAO ALSO ESPECIALLY COVERAGE MOST CLAIMS ACTUALLY END UP IN LITIGATION AND A SETTLEMENT KNOWS NOT SO MUCH STRAIGHT UP CLAIMS. SO WE DO RECOGNIZE SPECIALITY COVERAGES. BUT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE GIVE RATE BASED ON NEED. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE OF THE FAIR PLAN THAT YOU POINTED OUT. THEY ARE GETTING A 20% INCREASE WE WOULD LIKE THAT RATE TO BE AS LOW AS POSSIBLE BUT THAT'S NOT HOW WE DON'T. IMPOSE WHAT WE WISH WE IMPOSE WHAT THE DATA SUGGESTS THE RATE SHOULD BE. AND SO THEY GOT A RATE INCREASE PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOVIE. THAT OTHER EXAMPLE I GAVE OF THE FIRE LINE SCORES. THAT COMPANY ALREADY HAS A SIGNIFICANT SURCHARGE FOR PEOPLE IN THE WILD FIRE AREA SO WE DO ALLOW RATE FOR THOSE AREAS THEY DO CHARGE MORE. AND I'LL SAY OUR PROCESS OF USING THIS CATASTROPHE LOAD. THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS ARE PROBABLY CAUSING THAT CATASTROPHE LOW TO INCREASE BY ABOUT MAYBE 40%. THOSE LOSSES ARE GOING TO BE LOADED INTO INSURERS RATES FOR THE NEXT DECADE OR MORE. UNLESS THE RESERVES SUBROGATION RECOVERY TO HELP PULL THOSE LOSSES BACK OUT. SO WE DO ALLOW FOR THE RATE THIS WILL BE A DRAMATIC RATE INCREASE. DESPITE THE CATASTROPHE LOAD. ASSESS THAT WE USE FOR CONSUMERS AROUND THE STATION IMPORTANT. I THINK JILL FOCUS ON THE FAIR PLAN IS IS GREAT BECAUSE OF SEEK KNOWLEDGE THE FAIR PLAN ISN'T UNDER THE SAME RULES. HEY THERE ACTUALLY ENTITLED TO AN ACTUAL RELEASE ON RATE. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP ON A THREE THE DEPARTMENT HAS CHOSEN DOES NOT. YIELD UNNATURALLY SOUND RIGHT. AND SO YOU SEE WHEN YOU HAVE. DIFFERENT STANDARDS THE FAIR PLAN GETS A 20% INCREASE. RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S AN EGGNOG AND BY THE WAY I BELIEVE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE THE THE FIRE LINE RELATIVITY'S FOR FIRE LINE. IN THE FAIR PLAN THEY'RE ALLOWED TO CHARGE HIGHER -- HIGHER AMOUNTS AT THE UPPER END OF THE RISK RANGE WERE AS IN THE ADMITTED MARKET THOSE WOULD BE SUPPRESSED AND AND SUBSIDIES WOULD BE BORNE BY URBAN AND SUBURBAN CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT. IN IN THE WILL BE SO THERE ARE JUST DIFFERENT POLICY CHOICES HERE THAT ARE THERE ARE INVOLVED AND IT'S IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE -- A CRITICISM ASMUCH AS IT'S GOING TO BE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE TOLD THAT THERE SHOULD BE RESTRICTIONS ON UNDERWRITING. WELL LEAST ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE RATING CHOICES THE DEPARTMENT HAS MDE THAT ARE DRIVING THESE UNDERWRITING RESPONSES AND THAT THAT'S WE DON'T SEE THAT ACKNOWLEDGMENT HAVING BEEN MADE. MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH ONE LAST QUESTION AND THAT IS MISTER FRAZIER. THEN WHY IS THERE SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF COMPETITION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE SECOND HIGHEST ACCORDING [inaudible] TO MICHAEL. WHAT WELL I MEAN I CERTAINLY THINK THE REPORT SHOWED THAT SINCE IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE REDUCED BY A THIRD? OKAY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A TREND IN THE TREND IS GOING. WELL THE EXTRACTION IT'S HARD TO KNOW I MEAN THERE AGAIN WITH ANY REGULATORY SYSTEM THERE ARE PLUSES AND MINUSES THE THE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROP ONE OH THREE IT'S PROBLEMATIC IN SOME WAYS BUT IT INSULATES COMPANIES FROM COMPETITION IN A LOT OF WAYS AS WELL RIGHT. SO -- SO THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR COMPANIES TO HAVE MARKET SHARE TO STAY. RIGHT SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT HERE TO HAVE A BROADSIDE AGAINST PROP ONE OH THREE ASSISTS THERE ARE SOME IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS THAT HAD CONSEQUENCES AND WE JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE MEN OF THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEASURE THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK QUESTIONS. WELL I JUST HAVE ONE ASK QUESTIONS IF I MAY -- I'VE HEARD CENTER MORE LIKE NOTE THAT TO YOUR TRÃªN IS NOT ENOUGH. TO PREDICT THE FUTURE SO I'M CURIOUS ABOUT HOW WOULD PROBABILISTIC MODELING HELP ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. IS IT YES. THANK YOU. WELL THE THE CONCERN IS THAT THE THE MESSAGING WE'RE RECEIVING FREQUENTLY IS THAT WERE IN THE NEW NORMAL AND THERE'S A WORRY. WILL NINETEEN BE LIKE. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY AND WHO KNOWS RIGHT NOW EVERYONE HOPES IT'S NOT AND WE HOPE OVER OVER TIME -- AS THE STATE HAS MORE INVESTMENTS IN FUEL MANAGEMENT AND AND OTHER ISSUES THAT WE CAN REDUCE OSSES IN THE AGGREGATE. BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CONTINUED YEARS OF CATASTROPHIC LOSSES THAN LOOKING AT THE AVERAGE OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR THEY'RE SORT OF A SMOOTHING OF LOSSES OVER TIME. IS NOT. A A A A USEFUL PROTECTION OF IF THINGS HAVE CHANGED WHERE THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST. SO THE POINT IS IF THERE IS A MODELING METHODOLOGY THAT MORE ACTUALLY REFLECTS THE RISK OF LOSS MOVING FORWARD THAT'S NOT. REALLY. ANTON USING LAST TWENTY YEARS THEN WE WOULD LIKE THE CASE TO AT LEAST MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THIS IS A MORE -- APPROPRIATE METHOD OF BUILDING A RATE. AND IF WE CAN'T PROVE IT THEN THE DEPARTMENT IS FINE TO SAY NO BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT EVEN PERMITTED TO MAKE THAT CASE. THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY KERRY WE COOK ON ANOTHER TWO HOURS BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND YOUR INSIGHT AND THAT. WE'RE GONNA BY THE NEXT PANELIST TECH COMMA. ON THE NEXT PANEL WILL BE ACCESS TO HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. AND WE'RE GONNA FIGHT -- MARK SECOND VICE PRESIDENT STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS OF AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION AS WELL THE STATE'S EATEN REGULATION I'M SORRY REGULATORY AFFAIRS ADVOCATE ROLE COUNY REPRESENTATIVE OF CALIFORNIA. AND YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO TALK ON WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF MORE IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE FACE. MY NAME IS MARK SEGMENT NINE VICE PRESIDENT STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALLY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. I RARELY AGREE WITH MR MATIC ANYTHING MISTER MATTOX SAYS IN HIS NEW LIFE BUT I DO AGREE THAT MISTER FRASIER'S BRILLIANT SO WE'LL START THERE -- ACCESS TO INSURANCE IS KEY TO HOMEOWNERS OF ITS ONE OF THINGS WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO A YOU CAN'T GET A MORTGAGE WITHOUT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE -- UNFORTUNATELYTHE FLIP SIDE OF THAT AS WE FIND OUT THAT WHEN A LOT OF PEOPLE PAY OFF THEIR MORTGAGE THEY DO THEY DROP THEIR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE -- WE ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT OF TIME IS AN ASSOCIATION TRIED TO REMIND PEOPLE -- THAT THEY NEED TO UPDATE THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES AND THEY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MAINTAIN THEIR INSURANCE POLICIES EVEN IF THEY PAID OFF THEIR HOUSES -- AS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE PREVIOUS PANEL WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO CONFUSE AVAILABILITY WITH AFFORDABILITY -- RATE INCREASES ARE OUT THERE AND PEOPLE ARE SEEN THEM -- BUT THE IT THE DESIRE NOT TO PAY INCREASED INSURANCE POLICY IS NOT THE SAME THING AS NOT HAVING ACCESS TO AN INSURANCE POLICY. THE PREVIOUS PANEL ALSO TALKED ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS KEY HERE WHICH IS OF INSURER CAN'T GET ADEQUATE RATE TO COVER THE REST THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY FACE -- THIS IS NOT A BUSINESS THAT YOU MAKE IT UP IN VOLUME -- THEY HAVE TO USE OTHER TOOLS AND ONE OF THE FEW OTHER TOOLS IS TO USE UNDER WRITING TO CHOOSE WHERE THEY WANT TO WRITE AND HOW MANY POLICIES THEY WANT TO WRITE IN VERY SERIOUS. INJURES ALSO FACE RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON THEM BY RE INSURERS -- WE TALK ABOUT THE COSTA REINSURANCE BUT INJURY RANCHERS WILL ONLY PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPACITY -- BECAUSE THAT'S THE RISK THAT THEY WANT TO TAKE SO IF A RANCHER IS LIMITED THE COMPANY'S CAPACITY THAT WILL ALSO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF POLICIES THAT THEY CAN WRITE. SEVERAL YEARS AGO GOVERNOR BROWN STARTED THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE -- AS PART OF THAT AND AT THE REQUEST OF MANY WORLD ELECTED OFFICIALS THERE WAS AN INSURANCE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT WAS CREATED -- STATES NUYS SPENT MANY HOURS OF OUR LIFE THAT WILL NEVER GET BACK ON THIS TASK FORCE. BUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT A LOOK THAT WAS AVAILABILITY AND WHAT WE DISCOVERED IS THAT WHILE THERE IS A LOT OF ANECDOTAL DATA ON BOTH SIDES OF IT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND ACTUAL DATA ON THE AVAILABILITY -- EYES POINT AS POINTED OUT THAT STEP BRIEFING COMPANIES NEED TO BE MY MIND FOR MANAGING THEIR RESTORE SURE THE REST ARE NOT OVER THE CONCENTRATED ONE POTENTIALLY RISKY AREA. I ONCE WORKED FOR A COMPANY THAT HAD AN INSURANCE AGENT THAT SOLD FOUR HUNDRED POLICIES IN A MOBILE HOME PARK. IT WAS GREAT UNTIL THAT MOBILE HOME PARK BURNED DOWN -- SO COMPANIES ARE REEVALUATING THEIR WRISTS AS THEY AS CONDITIONS CHANGE AS WE BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE NOW ARE REFERRED TO AS THE NEW NORMAL. IS THAT WERE NEVER CONSIDERED FIRE WHICH ARE NOW BEING CONSIDERED FIRE REST THE QUESTION IS. IF COMPANY A DECIDES NOT TO RENEW POLICIES IN AN AREA ARE THERE COMPANIES THAT WILL STEP IN AND WRITE THE BUSINESS THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION WE NEED TO DO. ONE OF THINGS WE DISCOVERED AS WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS OF THE TASK FORCE ON AVAILABILITY. IS A LOT OF IT IS DETERMINED BY HOW IT CONSUMER PERCHES INSURANCE EVAN AND CONSUMER HAS A WHAT IS NOT A CAPTIVE AGENT AND THAT AGENT ONLY SELLS ONE COMPANIES INSURANCE. AND THAT COMPANY DECIDES TO READJUST THEIR BOOK AND MAY NOT BE WRITING IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. THAT CONSUMER MAY GET A PERCEPTION THAT THERE'S NOT INSURANCE AVAILABLE THE SAME THING CAN BE SAID FOR A COMPANY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS WITH AN AGENT THEM ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF AGENTS. SO WHAT WE TO SWAT WE SET UP IN THE TASK FORCE WHICH I THINK IT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT WE MAY SEE THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IS A SIERRA INSURANCE FINDER. THIS WAS A CONCEPT THAT THE MARKET IS INEFFICIENT BECAUSE CONSUMERS DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE GOOD INFORMATION. A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHOSE HOUSE LIVES JUST OUTSIDE THE WAS LEE AREA GOT A 5100% INCREASE ON HIS INSURANCE POLICY. BUT HE WEN OUT AND SHOPPING FOUND A BETTER POLICY FOR LESS RISK BUT HE'S BEEN IN THE CHARTS INDUSTRY FOR FORTY YEARS SO WE KNOW THESE THINGS. MOST CONSUMERS DEL THE CONCEPT TIMED INSURANCE FINDER WHICH IS BEING PILOTED AND THE THE C. R. T. ZERO CHARGE FIGHTER AND IS ALSO PART OF AB. EIGHTEEN SEVEN THE FIVE LEVINE IS THAT CONSUMERS WHO CAN'T FIND INSURANCE CAN PUT THEIR INFORMATION ON A WEBSITE COMPANIES AND AGENTS THAT REPRESENT COMPANIES THAT ARE STILL WRITING IN THESE BUSINESSES. AREAS CAN THEN FIND AND HOPEFULLY CONNECT AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO KIND OF TAKE CARE OF THAT -- AS YOU KNOW CONSUMERS INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED PROVIDE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE EITHER DIRECTLY OR FOR THROUGH THE FAIR PLAN THE FAIR PLAN IS AS REFERENCE IN YOUR MATERIAL THROUGH THE INSURER OF THE LAST RESORT. ALTHOUGH ORIGINALLY CREATED IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES AFTER THE URBAN. UNREST AND STILL PRIMARILY FOCUS ON URBAN AREAS THERE IS A GROWING BOOK OF BUSINESS FOR THE FAIR PLAN DEALING WITH WHILE THESE WILDFIRE INTERFACE AREAS. I IN MANY WAYS THE FAIR PLAN AXES A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE WE CAN ANTICIPATE THAT IF THE FAIR PLAN POLICY COUNTS CO OP WE MADE THAT MAY SIGNAL MAY SIGNAL A PROBLEM IN THE ADMITTED MARKET THAT WE NEED TAKE A LOOK AT HOWEVER WE NEED TO BE. CAREFUL THAT WE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RATES -- THERE WAS CONVERSATIONS EARLIER ABOUT THE APRIL RATE INCREASE WELL IRONICALLY THE FAIR PLAN SAW A HUGE SURGEON POLICIES IN MARCH WAS THAT DUE TO THE IMPENDING RATE INCREASE THAT AGENTS WERE PUSHING WE DON'T KNOW. ANOTHER THING WE NEED TO TRACK IS HOW LONG TO POLICY STAY WITH THE FAIR PLAN -- WHAT THE FAIR PLAN IS FOUND IS AT 12% OF THEIR POLICIES STAY LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS? IN WHICH THAT MEANS THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE THAN FINDING COVERAGE OUT IN THE MINUTE MARKET WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT THEM TO BE. ALL WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET WITH HER LITTLE REFERENCE HERE -- THE STAFF ANALYSIS REFERENCES SOME OF THE MORE EXOTICS A SURPLUS LINES COMPANIES LIKE LLOYDS OF LONDON OF MANY OF OUR NOT THAT EXOTIC MANY OF MORE -- DID BY ADMITTED INSURERS -- SUCH AS A I G. A NATIONWIDE LIBERTY OTHERS HAVE THESE COMPANIES THE USE THAT BECAUSE THEY ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY TO WRITE IN HIGH RISK AREAS WE HAVE SEEN SOME INCREASE. IN THE SURPLUS LINES MARKET WE DON'T KNOW WOODS IS VERY THICK HOW SIGNIFICANT IS. CLEARLY THE MARKET IT'S HARD IN AND COMPANIES ARE TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT THE REST IN THEIR BOOK OF BUSINESS. THERE IS ANOTHER TOOLMENTION IN THE STAFF BRIEFING THAT CAN HELP MORE INSURERS RIGHT BUSINESS THAT IS A BETTER USE OF MODELING. BY THIS TIME OF MODEL IN ANY PREDICTIVE MODELING WE ARE HEARING A LOT ABOUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED IN CALIFORNIA HOW WE'RE LIVING IN A NEW NORMAL. UNFORTUNATE OUR MODELS DO NOT ALLOW US TO LOOK FORWARD THEY ONLY ALLOW US TO LOOK BACKWARDS. AND USE THAT ANALOGY HOW THIS BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IN A CAR YOUR WINDSHIELD IS MUCH BIGGER THAN YOUR REAR VIEW MIRROR BECAUSE YOU DO NEED TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS THAT SAME ISSUE. WE HOPE THAT BY BETTER USE OF PREDICTIVE MODELING THAT ALLOW COMPANIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RISKS WHEN INSURANCE CAN UNDERSTAND THE RISKS THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR APPETITE. MY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS A BROAD -- CROSS SECTION OF LARGE MEDIUM AND SMALL INSURERS IN MANY CASES SMALL MEDIUM INSURERS MAY USE THESE DIFFERENT MODEL IN AN UNDERWRITING TOOLS AND THEY HAVE AN APPETITE TO WRITE IN HIGH RISK AREAS WERE SMALL COMPANIES DO NOT. REMEMBER DURING A PARTICULARLY HEATED CONVERSATION DURING THE INSURANCE TASK FORCE MEETING WHEN A CAPTIVE AGENT WAS TALK ABOUT AVAILABILITY PROBLEM GRASS VALLEY. I HAVE ONE OF MY MEMBERS ON THE PHONE TO SEND OUT WITH OUR COMPANY WRITING POLICIES IN THERE BUT THEY WERE LOSING POLICIES TO OTHER COMPANIES. SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A VARIETY OF COMPANIES THAT MAY BE WILLING TO WRITE IN THIS AREA WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOSTER THAT. AND THE ADDRESS OF TIME -- BREAST AND TAKE QUESTIONS. WELL IT TO THE PRECEDING APPLE HOLDER QUESTIONS UNTIL YOU'RE DONE THANK YOU SO MUCH INTRODUCE YOURSELF PLEASE THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'M STACY HEATING RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION TO COME AND SPEAK THIS MORNING. I DON'T CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT ON INSURANCE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM BUT I AM YOU KNOW I HAVE A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE OF COUNTIES IN RURAL COUNTIES AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND SO. I'LL SPEAK FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THIS MORNING AND MARK IS COMPLETELY RIGHT WE DID GIVE A LOT OF OUR LIVES TO HIM HE SUBGROUP OF THE OF ON INSURANCE TO THE TREE MORTALITY TASK FORCE IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF PERIOD I THINK THAT WE WORKED ON THAT. A LOT OF OUR MEMBER COUNTIES PARTICIPATED THAT GROUP ARE OUR LOCAL ELECTED THEM WORKED REALLY HARD TO TRY. TO FIND SOLUTIONS I MEAN IT WASN'T A COMBATIVE GROUP BUT THEY WANT TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR CONSTITUENCIES BECAUSE IF. THEY'RE NOT CALLING THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THEY'RE CALLING THEIR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS SAYING MY POLICY JUST GOT NON RENEWED OR CANCELLED OR MY A PREMIUM JUST WENT UP THREE AND A HALF TIMES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT AND THEN WHEN. THEY ARE ELECTED WITH THE COLOR ELECTED THAN THEIR ELECTED CALLS ME IF THEY'RE ON MY BOARD SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING AND THAT. I WANT TO TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE BACK TO PAGE TWENTY OF DOLE'S. OF DOLE'S PRESENTATION BECAUSE HE KIND OF DENTAL WORK FOR ME AND I DIDN'T ANTICIPATE THAT SO GOD BLESS HIM ON THAT. BUT AND HE HAS. A LOVELY CHART HERE THIS IS THE NUMBER OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. ABOUT HOMEOWNER NON RENEWALS. AND PREMIUM INCREASES. THE TOP LINE SHOWS THE COUNTIES IN -- HI WILD FIRE RISK AREAS JUST BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT THEY GOT THAT WENT OUT FROM. 1-009-420-0017 TO HAD TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO -- THOSE COMPLAINTS ARE STILL GOING UP AND WE'RE STILL HEARING FROM OUR COUNTIES THAT THEIR CONSTITUENCIES ARE STILL GETTING NON RENEWED AND CANCELLED -- IN THEIR AREAS AND THEY'RE STILL HEARING ABOUT THIS AND ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE THE NARRATIVE THIS YEAR'S KIND OF SHIFTED TO COMMUNITY PROTECTION FROM WILDFIRES AND SORT OF WHY DID THOSE DARN COUNTIES BUILD IN THESE HIGH WILD FIRE RISK AREAS IN THE WE WE RIGHT. WE'RE GETTING OUR FIT WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF FISH SHAKEN OUT US RIGHT NOW. IN A LOT OF OUR COUNTIES THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT HAS GROWN UP AROUND THEM RIGHT A LOT OF THE ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN THERE FOR DECADES AND A LOT OF THOSE FOLKS LIVING THERE HAVE. BEEN THERE FOR GENERATIONS SO. DUE TO YOU KNOW FORCE MANAGEMENT CLIMATE CHANGE AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT THIS WILDFIRE PROBLEM. HAS COME UP AROUND A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT HAVE HOMES IN THESE AREAS AND AND THEY'VE BEEN LIVING THERE WITH THEIR FAMILIES FOR FOR DECADES. AND A LOT OF THESE DEVILISH WE COMMUNITIES ARE. IN LOW INCOME AREAS UNDER AB FIFTEEN FIFTY AS WELL SO WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW POSH HOMES ON NICE REAL ESTATE IF YOU GO TO LAKE COUNTY ALL YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. SO. THESE ARE FOLKS THAT NEED AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE INSURANCE POLICIES FOR THEIR HOMES AND AND ARE STRUGGLING WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED HERE TODAY -- SO AVAILABILITY DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN SUSTAINABLE AND AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE RATE INCREASE ISSUES ALREADY -- AND IT. SO LET ME READ YOU AN EMAIL THAT I GOT FROM ONE OF MY COUNTY SO SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND MY BOARD MEMBER SENT ME THIS IT SAYS IT'S FROM ONE OF HIS CONSTITUENTS. JUST ONE EXAMPLE I DO NOT KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED NOTICE THAT OUR PROPERTY INSURANCE HAS BEEN CANCELLED. SO FAR MY AGENT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT COMPANY THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TO OUR PROPERTY TO SEE WHAT EVASIVE MEASURES WE TAKE TO MAKE OUR PLACE SECURE. ALSO HOMEOWNERS WITH MORTGAGES THAT DO NOT GET NEW INSURANCE PLACE THEMSELVES IN A PLACE THAT THE BANKS COULD FOR CLOTHES. WELOVE IT HERE BUT LIKE OTHERS WILL BE FORCED TO SELL AND RELOCATE TO STATE THAT DOES NOT HAVE THESE ISSUES. IF YOU GET IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO LOOK INTO THIS WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT THANKS. AND MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE COMING TO US WITH THESE TYPES OF OF REQUESTS FROM THEIR CONSTITUENCIES. AND SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FORCE ANYTHING YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FORCE THE INDUSTRY WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM. FOR MONTHS NOW. WE HAVE TRIED TO LOOK INTO THE MODELS YOU KNOW THE FIRE LINE MODEL THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE ROOM IN THE STAFF REPORT FOR THIS HEARING. LOOKS AT THINGS FROM A VERY SORT OF LANDSCAPE SCALE RATHER THAN WHAT THE COMMUNITIES ARE DOING AND WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES THERE. A LOT OF OUR FOLKS THAT LIVE OUT IN OUR COUNTIES ARE COMMUNITIES ARE DOING VERY VERY GOOD WORK AROUND THEIR HOMES TO PROTECT THEM AND MAKE THEM MORE FIRE RESISTANT DOING THEIR DEFENSIBLE SPACE. AND WE EVEN WORKED IN THE TASK FORCE AND CAME UP WITH A REALLY GOOD TERRORISTS PRODUCTION MODEL WE WORKED WITH CAL FIRE FOR A LONG TIME ON THAT OUR COUNTY IS DEAD. AND THAT KIND OF STALLED AND DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE AND AND IT'S A REALLY GOOD LIKE FIVE PAGE RISK REDUCTION MODEL TIERED. SO THAT HOMEOWNERS IF THEY MET CERTAIN CRITERIA COULD PERHAPS GET SOME DISCOUNTS ARE SOME ASSURANCE THAT THEY WOULD BE NON RENEWED. AND THAT SORT OF STALLED IN KIND OF SAD YOU KNOW IN A IN A POOL SOMEWHERE IN THERE IT IS -- AND IT IS SORT OF BUDGET IMPACTS TOOK COUNTIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS KIND OF THE LAST THING I HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW LOSS FROM PROPERTY TAXES THE FOLKS MOVE AWAY OR CAN'T FIND ANYBODY TO SELL THEIR HOMES TO OR THAT SORT OF THING. IT'S KIND OF THE LAST THING ON OUR MEMBERSHIPS MIND IT'S WE DON'T WANT OUR CONSTITUENTS TO NOT HAVE INSURANCE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO SUFFER LOSSES. THAT THEY CAN'T BE COVERED FOR IF I CAN OTHER CAMP FIRE BREAKS OUT. AND WE'VE SEEN SOME VERY PERSONAL THINGS AND PERSONAL IMPACTS ARE BUTTE COUNTY. SUPERVISOR LOST HIS HOME IN THE CAMP FIRE. AND SO IT'S VERY PERSONAL THE ASSN VERY PERSONAL TO OUR BOARD MEMBER SO. WE'RE HERE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY ON SOLUTIONS TO THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT IS. VERY PERSONAL TO OUR MEMBERSHIP AND TO THEIR CONSTITUENCIES AND WE'RE HOPING THAT AS WE GO FORWARD. WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH THEM AND WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO TRY TO SORT OF SEE IF WE CAN COALESCE AROUND SOME SOLUTIONS. MOVING AHEAD THANK YOU THANK [inaudible] ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] MORE LIKE [inaudible] BY. TO HAVE JOKES. AND EXPLAIN. I HAVE A FEW MINUTES BUT I AYE BEFORE ASSAM. SOMEONE ELSE TO COME UP I JUST WANNA ADDRESS JOB SOMETHING THAT YOU MENTIONED OUT YOU SAID. LET'S JUST GET IN THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS GROWING AND SO I WANT YOU TO ADDRESS A PARTICULAR QUESTION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S REPORT THAT SAYS. SHOULD INSURERS BE OBLIGATED TO OFFER CONSUMERS WHO ARE L. INELIGIBLE FOR HOMEOWNERS POLICY THEIR DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY OR A PREMISES LIABILITY POLICY AS COMPLEMENTARY COVERAGE FOR FOR PLAN. FIRE POLICY CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT QUESTION I CERTAINLY IF YOU GO TO THE FAIR PLAN WEBSITE YOU REALIZE FAIR PLAN HAS ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE BY STATURE THE FAIR PLAN IS A FIRE ONLY POLICY AND THAT WAS A POLICY DECISION MADE BY THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THE FAIR PLAN WAS. EXCEPT AS SET UP -- THEY DO OFFER A DIFFERENT WHAT IS CALLED THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS POLICY I THINK THERE EIGHT OR NINE COMPANIES THAT OFFER IT -- YOU CAN EITHER GET IT THAT WAY OR SURPLUS LINES COMPANIES ARE THE COMPANIES WILL CALL WHAT'S CALLED THE WRAPAROUND POLICY AND THAT WILL PROVIDE THE OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT. THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER'S POLICY WOULD HAVE SO THE THAT PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU CONTENT WILL THANK YOU FOR THAT STATES IF I MAY USE MENTIONED A FIVE PAGE REPORT A YOU CAME UP WITH FOR RISK ASSESSMENT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE IF YOU CAN. MAKE SURE I GET IT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT THANK YOU. EITHER WITH ME I CAN GIVE THAT TO YOU DIRECTLY AND THEN I'LL SEND THE ELECTRONIC VERSION TO HUGH LATER THANK YOU SO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND TAKEN AT THIS TIME THIS MORNING TO COME AND BE WITH US. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR INSIGHT AND DEAD THANK YOU AGAIN. SO AT THIS POINT SINCE WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES I WOULD LIKE TO PASS TOOL IF HE CAN COME UP I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW YOU HAD A LOT OF INFORMATION TO SHARE AND I THOUGHT WE WOULDN'T HAVE TIME BUT CAN YOU ADDRESS PEACH TREE MANY WERE SAYS THE NUMBERS OF CONSUMER. COMPLAINTS FOR HOMEOWNERS NON RENEWALS AND PREMIUM INCREASES ACTS I BELIEVE IT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT WE DIDN'T GET TO HALF AND SELL. PAGE TWENTY HAVE YOU CAN SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT ON ON THIS PAGE IN PARTICULAR. IT TO SIX IS POINT THANKS. FOR POINTING IT OUT AND I'M HOPING IT WAS HELPFUL. WE HAVE HAD THIS INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS ABOUT PREMIUMS GOING UP WE ALWAYS GET SOME. OR GETTING PEOPLE BEING NON RENEWED. OUR POINT HERE IS NOT ONLY IS THAT INCREASING JUST GENERALLY STATE RIGHT WHY'D BUT MOST MOST OF THAT. BOOK OF OF THOSE THAT INCREASE IS COMING FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTIES. NOW SO THEY ARE ARE SIERRA FOOTHILLS IN THOSE COUNTY SAID TO HAVE A LOT OF WE WE EXPOSURE -- WHILE STATEWIDE YOU MIGHT THINK THIRD THERE ISN'T A CRISIS IF YOU ARE IN ONE OF THOSE COUNTIES. YOU MIGHT START TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. GIVEN IN OUR YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE -- ANNIE ONE HOMEOWNER MIGHT THINK WE'LL. IS A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT IT WASN'T AN ISSUE AT ALL WHEN I MOVED HERE. AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M NON RENEWED AND CAN'T CAN'T FIND COVERAGE OR IN GETTING A PREMIUM INCREASE. DOUBLE AND TRIPLE OF WHAT I PAID JUST A FEW YEARS AGO. SO IT'S THE BULK OF THE INCREASE IS COMING FROM. A SMALL SUBSET OF THE STATE RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THERE'S WE'RE GETTING. HUGE INCREASE FROM 38% OF THE STATE IS MAKING THE BULK OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT'S BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THAT MOVIE AREA AND THANK YOU ORTEZ WE HAVE UP HERE ANY MEMBER LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION SAYS THAT PERTAINS TO IMAGES. DISCUSSED. NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR COMING UP IN ENSURING THAT WITH AS WELL -- WE ACTUALLY DID GOOD TIMING DESPITE THE FACT THAT CHOI BELIEVED TO COLOR TIME AS FROM IS FROM. RIGHT MA'AM BUT WE DID GOOD TIMING SO THAT'S GOOD YOU KNOW I LIKE GORDON ALIKE EFFICIENCY CELLS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND AND SITTING WITH US THIS MORNING -- NOW I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND ASK QUESTIONS ANYBODY WELCOME TO COME UP. PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ASK A QUESTION -- MAKE YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF. MADAM CHAIR -- JOHN NOR WOULD ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA INSURANCE WHOLESALERS ASSOCIATION. I I DID WANT TO MAKE JUST A FEW COMMENTS BY -- SUNDAY AND MONDAY WENT TO A CONVENTION FOR THE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND DR NUMBER OF AGENTS AND BROKERS I THOUGHT I WOULD SHARE SOME ANECDOTAL INFORMATION ON THIS TOPIC. TO GLEAN FROM THAT -- I AGREE WITH THE PROPOSITION THAT OVERALL IN CALIFORNIA WE REALLY WE DON'T HAVE A HOME MORTGAGE MARKET CRISIS AT ALL. BUT AS BROKERS TOLD ME IF YOU LIVE IN THE IN THE FOOTHILLS ARE IN THE MOUNTAINS OR ANYTHING WITH A CANYON EXPOSURE. OR YOU KNOW IN THE BRUSH HIGH RISK AREAS THAT IS AN UNPRECEDENTED MARKET RIGHT NOW AND SO IT JUST INDIVIDUALS I TALKED. TO ONE ROKU TOLD ME THEN THIS HERE FOOTHILLS HE SAYING PREMIUM ARMS FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND IN THE FIVE TO TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR A AREA ANNUALLY THAT'S THAT'S HUGE. YOU KNOW FROM THAT STANDPOINT AGAIN THERE'S SOME VERY NICE HOMES UP THERE AND YOU KNOW THAT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. AS WELL -- A BROKER I TALKED TO SAID THAT THEY RARELY EVER USE THE FAIR PLAN BUT IN THIS CASE -- HE HAS. HAS SUBMITTED THIRTY FOR PLANNED REQUESTS JUST IN THE LAST MONTH FOR OUR APPLICATIONS JUST IN THE LAST MONTH -- WE'RE ALSO SEEING PEOPLE TRYING TO DO THINGS TO REDUCE OUR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE ONE BROKER TOLD ME THIS IS SAYING -- TEN THOUSAND UP TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE POLICIES IN HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK IS PRETTY MUCH UNPRECEDENTED WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT FOR A LONG TIME -- OTHER ONE OTHER BROKER TOLD ME THAT. USUALLY WHEN THE MARKET WITH A MINUTE COMPANIES ARE WRITING YOU CAN PLACE BUSINESS AND NOT NOT ADMITTED AREA AND SHE SAID THAT SHE'S GETTING TURN DOWNS FROM THE NOT ADMITTED. AREA BECAUSE COMPANIES LIKE LEXINGTON IN SCOTTSDALE ARE REACHING THEIR CAPACITY -- FOR EXPOSURES IN THE FIRE AREAS AND LASTLY I TALKED TO ONE INSURANCE EXECUTIVE WHO BASICALLY SAID. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO NON RENEW POLICIES WE DON'T WANT TO NON RENEW JUST BECAUSE WE CAN'T FIND THE REINSURANCE FOR RIGHT RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO WRITE I THINK PUT THIS ALL COMES DOWN. TO IS THAT YOU KNOW LIKE. PROBABLY ANY OTHER INDUSTRY YOU KNOW INSURANCE INDUSTRY LIKES CERTAINTY AND THERE'S ALWAYS THE RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. EVERY FIRE MAP THAT WAS BEEN DONE BUT FOR INSURANCE COMPANY VÃ  AND DONE FOR CALIFORNIA. THE UTILITIES ECCENTRIC BUT PROVED TO BE WRONG -- SO THE IN THE AREA OR WE'RE SEEING LOSSES THEIR UNPRECEDENTED GOING FROM A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO THE ABOVE TEN BILLION DOLLARS -- THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WANTS TO SEE CERTAINTY THEY WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING. TO HAPPEN BUT I THINK WE ARE SITTING IN CALIFORNIA IS THE WORLDWIDE MARKET DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA ONE IS GOING TO STOP. YEAH WOULD YOU KNOW IF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO -- TO TO AND WE ARE DEAL WITH THE VIRAL LOAD AND THINGS LIKE THAT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL HOW MUCH TIME WILL TAKE X. ACTRESS SO I JUST THOUGHT THOSE -- EDU DEL TWENTY HOW SHOULD. BE WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO YOUR A CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YOU MAY PROCEED THANK YOU MORNING CARA CROSS AND I'M REPRESENTING TODAY INSURANCE SERVICES OFFICE WHICH PROVIDES THE FIRE LINE PRODUCT -- I WANTED TO MAKE A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPLICATION THAT FIRE SCORES ARE NOT GOOD INDICATORS. ON WHEN IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS ALLOWED THE FAIR PLAN TO USE FIRE SCORES AND ALSO IS MISTER LARGER SAID. THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVING -- RATES THAT WERE INSURERS HAVE USED FIRE SCORES. I'M FROM A COMPETITIVE STANDPOINT INSURERS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO USE THE TOOLS AT OUR BEST AVAILABLE TO THEM. BAR LINE IS A SCIENTIFICALLY AN AXE HURLEY VERIFIED TOOL RECOGNIZED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA AS A CRITICAL TOOL FOR INSURERS TO MORE ACCURATELY AND RESPONSIBLY MANAGED EXPOSURE TO WILDFIRE. THIS IS NECESSARY IN THE STATE WITH THE NEW NORMAL -- FIRELIGHT HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY FOR OVER FIFTEEN YEARS IT WAS DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE FIRE PROTECTION AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY UC BERKELEY NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. FROM AN INSURANCE STANDPOINT FIRE SCORES PROVIDE THEM THE ABILITY TO MEASURE THE TRUE EXPOSURE PRESENTED BY WILD FIRE THIS IS CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN. RISK BASE PRICING AND RESPONSIBLY MANAGING EXPOSURE. IN ADDITION THE ABILITY TO MORE ACCURATELY IDENTIFY WILD FIRE EXPOSURES HIS HELP INSURERS WHO BEFORE MAY HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO ASSUME GREATER RISK IN CERTAIN REGIONS. EXPAND THEIR BOOKS THE BUSINESS IN THESE HAZARDS. ON THE MITIGATION FRONT TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIVIDUAL MITIGATION EFFORTS WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE WESTERN FIRE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND LOCAL WILD FIRE EXPERTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED THE TEST LAB TO EVALUATE VARIOUS PREVENTION METHODOLOGIES. SUCH AS FUEL REDUCTIONS BUILDING HARDENING AND OTHER MITIGATION EFFORTS. AND THEIR EFFECTS OF THE DAMAGED HUNDRED PATTERNS CREATED BY WILDFIRES. THE GOAL THESE EFFORTS IS TO OBTAIN THE DATA NECESSARY TO PROPERLY EVALUATE THESE MEASURES FROM ACTUAL PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE I WOULD LIKE TO COME UP AND MAKE A COMMENT TO ASK QUESTIONS. OKAY WITH THAT I WILL JUST TURN IT OVER TWENTY MEMBERS LAST COMMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER MOORE LIKE WHO'S BEEN SUCH A TROOPER HAS BEEN BY MY SIDE THE ENTIRE TIME I TRULY APPRECIATE THAT. AND DEBT THANK YOU AND THIS IS REALLY OUR INFORMATIVE AND AS I SHOWED EARLIER OFF. WE'RE NOW TASK -- IN THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON WILDFIRES TO TO COME UP WITH A VIABLE SOLUTION SO CLEARLY THIS IS HELPFUL IN TERMS OF INFORMING OUR DECISION MOVING FORWARD AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE TIME THAT YOU SPEND HERE SHARING AND TA. AND EVERYONE WE BEHAVING WELL ALSO THANK YOU THAT'S A JOKE BUT THANK YOU AND ACT WITH THAT -- I WILL ADJOURN THE MEETING AND WE'LL SEE YOU SOON THANK YOU
