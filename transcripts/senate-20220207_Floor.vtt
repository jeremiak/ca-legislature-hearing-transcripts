00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:14.286
OF MY GREAT MEMENTOS. IT IS. A

00:14:14.353 --> 00:14:15.754

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:40.646
THAT MASTER PLAN HERE'S- NOT WAS

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:44.817
. THAT IS. KNOWING AT THE TIME

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:48.187

EDUCATION EMBRACED THE ROLE OF

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:22.788
CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THE QUALITY

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:25.624
OF EDUCATION. NOT AS A

COMPETITOR BUT AS A COMPLIMENT.

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:30.596

BUSINESSES TO DO SO I THINK IT'S

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.444
AN UNNECESSARY BURDEN WHEN WE
