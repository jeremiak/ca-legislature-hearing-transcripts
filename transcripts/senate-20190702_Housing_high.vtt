00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:17.395
FIRST AND GO WITH THAT SECTION

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:18.563
OF THE BILL THIS YEAR WE'RE

00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:19.931

OF THE APR.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.535

FRUIT THAT WE CAN ADD AND I

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:27.405
THINK THAT'S A CONVERSATION WE

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:28.473

THIS YEAR WHICH IS ADDING THINGS

00:33:37.715 --> 00:33:39.283
TO THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT.

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.551
BETTER REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:42.353
CONTEXT OF THE GENERAL PLAN IN

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.122

AND IS THERE A NEED TO REPORT

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.006
THAT TO EACH CD.

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:03.574
BUT AT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL

00:34:03.641 --> 00:34:05.042
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING A

00:34:05.109 --> 00:34:06.811
CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER WHO

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.079

MOSTLY -- BUT I SEE LIKE MAYBE

00:35:57.154 --> 00:35:58.422
ONE CITY PREPARES IT AND YOU

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.391
LEASE HAVE A TEMPLATE OR MODEL

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:02.727
AND THEN OTHERS COULD FOLLOW.

00:36:02.793 --> 00:36:03.327
OR DO YOU HAVE A TEMPLATE THAT

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:04.328
YOU HAVE ALREADY.

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:06.497
SORT OF IN MIND.

00:36:06.564 --> 00:36:07.698
I I I DON'T THINK WE HAVE

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:09.033
CURRENTLY AT THIS MOMENT A

00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:10.468
TEMPLATE I THINK IT WAS ALL I

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:12.103
THINK WAS EXPECTED TO BE IN

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.471
PARTNERSHIP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:36:13.538 --> 00:36:15.072
WITH EACH CD.

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:16.607
COMING UP WITH SOME TYPE OF

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:19.610
UNIFORMITY OF OF THE WAY DATA IS --

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.046
PUSHED OUT OR A RECEIVED FROM A

00:36:22.113 --> 00:36:24.582
CD SO -- WITH THAT I THINK

00:36:24.649 --> 00:36:26.050
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA AND A

00:36:26.117 --> 00:36:27.585
SUGGESTION THAT WE WOULDFORWARD

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.420
TO EIGHT CD AS THEY REACH OUT TO

00:36:29.487 --> 00:36:31.489
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COLLECT

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.291
DATA.

00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:34.125

THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.270
THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY A LOT OF

00:36:46.337 --> 00:36:47.772
THE DATA WERE ASKING FOR ALREADY

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:50.608
EXIST ON A LOCAL LEVEL -- IT'S

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:52.043
JUST SCATTERED AND ALL WE'RE

00:36:52.109 --> 00:36:53.578
ASKING FOR THEM TO DO IS TAKE

00:36:53.644 --> 00:36:55.713
MUCH OF THE DATA AND PUT IT INTO

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:57.548
A BUCKET AND FORWARDED TO EIGHT

00:36:57.615 --> 00:36:59.917

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:06.851
AHEAD.

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.719
THINKING I'D SPEAKING TO THE

00:38:08.786 --> 00:38:10.287
MILLENNIAL GENERATION -- YOU

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.055

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:12.757
THAT HAS US REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.091
THIS IS THAT.

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.593
THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE MORE DATA

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.995
ON THE STATE'S EIGHTY YOU AND JD

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.631

00:38:20.698 --> 00:38:22.933
AS ADVOCATES TO HELP OUR CITIES.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.135
MAKE THEIR PROGRAMS THEIR LOCAL

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.536
ORDINANCES MORE EFFECTIVE

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.038
BECAUSE WE CAN SEE BETTER WHERE.

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.439
THE PROGRAM'S WORKING OR MAYBE

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:30.207
NOT WORKING AND HELP POTENTIALLY

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:31.642
IDENTIFY BARRIERS SO THAT I

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:32.843
THINK THE STATE LEVEL TO THAT

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.079
DATA CAN BE VERY USEFUL FOR

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:36.480
IMPROVING THE STATE'S -- STREAM

FUTURE THAT'S A OBVIOUSLY VERY

00:38:41.085 --> 00:38:43.387
HOT TOPIC THIS YEAR -- BUT GOING

00:38:43.454 --> 00:38:44.388
FORWARD THIS WILL ALLOW US TO

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:47.925
BETTER -- BUT BETTER DETERMINE

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:49.460
IF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL

00:38:49.527 --> 00:38:51.062
SO THEN YOU'RE KIND OF HOPING TO

00:38:51.128 --> 00:38:53.631

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:54.231

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.436

THAT'S THAT'S RIGHT WILL AT THE

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:08.713
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS START

00:39:08.779 --> 00:39:10.581
COLLECTING THAT DATA HOPEFULLY.

00:39:10.648 --> 00:39:12.650
AND AND HOPEFULLY DETERMINE SOME

00:39:12.717 --> 00:39:13.484
OF THOSE TRENDS THAT YOU'RE

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.585
TALKING ABOUT SO YET MAYBE NOT

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:19.256

THEN I WOULDN'T MIND THISBUT

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:07.204
THAT ISN'T IN A PLACE YET I'M

00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:07.838
TRYING.

00:40:07.905 --> 00:40:09.240
TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO I HELP THE

00:40:09.306 --> 00:40:13.410
PUBLIC BUT NOT.

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:15.179
YOU KNOW BOGGED DOWN.

00:40:15.246 --> 00:40:16.113
YOU KNOW OUR CITIES AND COUNTIES

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.615
ARE ENJOYING A TWENTY ONE AND A

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:18.182
HALF BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:19.850
THEY'RE ACTUALLY.

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:21.085
LAYING OFF POLICE OFFICERS TO

00:40:21.152 --> 00:40:23.120
MAKE THEIR BUDGETS WORKS RIGHT I

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.855
WANT TO BE CAREFUL SO TO STRIKE

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.991
A GOOD BALANCE AND HAVING SERVED

00:40:27.057 --> 00:40:28.692
LOCALLY -- CENTER AYE AYE I AM

00:40:28.759 --> 00:40:30.461
VERY SENSITIVE TO MAKING SURE

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:33.430
THAT -- WE DON'T PUT MORE ON TO

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.299
CITIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:36.901
THEN WHAT IS NEEDED HOWEVER --

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.869
AS YOU FOR MULTIPLE TIMES OVER

00:40:38.936 --> 00:40:41.705
OVER WE ARE IN A HOUSING CRISIS.

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:42.973
I WOULD DOES SAY IT'S VERY

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.242
POSSIBLE POSSIBLE TO BELIEVE

00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:46.744
THAT WITH MUCH OF THE DATA THAT

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:48.179
WE'RE ASKING OR DATA THAT WE'RE

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:50.414
ASKING.

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:51.849
FOR HAD WE HAD IT.

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:52.650
A WHILE BACK AT LEAST A DECADE

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:54.585
AGO I'M NOT SAYING IT WOULD HAVE

00:40:54.652 --> 00:40:55.986
ELIMINATED THIS CRISIS BUT IT

00:40:56.053 --> 00:40:57.254
SURE WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US TO BE

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.889
A LOT MORE PREPARED. FOR THE

00:40:58.956 --> 00:41:00.191
DIRECTION WE WERE GOING AND

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:02.026
POSSIBLY TURN THE SHIP BEFORE IT

00:41:02.092 --> 00:41:03.260
BECAME A CRISIS.

00:41:03.327 --> 00:41:06.030
SO A LOT OF THE STATE AGAIN IF

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:07.665
THE CITY IS NOT COLLECTING IT

00:41:07.731 --> 00:41:09.834
THAT COULD POSSIBLY A TRIBUTE TO

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:12.770
WHY THERE IS A SITUATION OR

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:13.838
ENVIRONMENT WHERE THERE'S NON

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:14.972
PRODUCTIVITY.

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.907
BUT IF THE DATA IS THERE I'M

00:41:16.974 --> 00:41:18.442
SURE IT'S ABLE TO BE USED TO BE

00:41:18.509 --> 00:41:20.911
ABLE TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES. TO

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.948
BE ABLE -- TO ADMIN IS -- DO

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.516
MINISTER APPROVALS ON CERTAIN

00:41:25.583 --> 00:41:27.451
PROJECTS AND THEN ALLOW OTHER

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:28.886
PROJECTS THAT DEFINITELY NEED TO

00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:31.622
GO THROUGH A DIFFERENT PROCESS --

00:41:31.689 --> 00:41:33.023
ALLOW THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:35.426
CITY TO DO THAT BUT TO BE ABLE

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:36.894
TO PROVIDE DATA THAT DATA IS

00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:41.699
THERE IN MOST CASES ALREADY SO

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.400
IF I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:41:43.467 --> 00:41:44.401
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP ME.

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:45.069
IF MARIN COUNTY WOULD HAVE

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:46.370
ADOPTED THIS TEN YEARS AGO IT

00:41:46.437 --> 00:41:48.372
WOULD HAVE HOW MANY MORE UNITS.

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.441
I AM NOT SURE IF I CAN QUANTIFY

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:51.775
THAT FROM THIS PODIUM RIGHT NOW

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.310
APOLOGIZE FOR THROWING THAT AT

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.645
YOU BUT I'M JUST.

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:55.846
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE POINT

00:41:55.913 --> 00:41:58.048
YOU'RE MAKING OKAY THANK YOU

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:58.916
VERY MUCH.

00:41:58.983 --> 00:41:59.850
AND I THINK IT'S A A A A

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:00.584
TEMPLATE.

00:42:00.651 --> 00:42:02.620
OR SOMETHING ALONG THAT LINE TO

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.421
MAKE IT EASIER FOR LOCAL

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:06.190
JURISDICTIONS TO REPORT DATA IS

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.658
SOMETHING THAT WE ARE VERY VERY

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:09.260
OPEN.

00:42:09.326 --> 00:42:10.094
TO HAVING DISCUSSIONS AS THE

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.763
BILL WOULD MOVE FORWARD IF IT

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.165
WAS TO DO SO.

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:17.401
I WAS TO START.

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.869
THIS ORDER AFTER THAT THAT WHAT

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:20.104
WE HAVE FOUND THE PAST IS THAT

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.538
WHEN YOU HAVE MORE DATA FOR

00:42:21.605 --> 00:42:23.874
EXAMPLE WHEN AFTER SB THIRTY

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.743
FIVE OR STREAMLINING BILL PASSED.

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:27.912
IN THE CITY RELEASED THE DATA

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:30.314
THAT 97% CITIES WERE NOT MEETING

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.649
THEIR LOW INCOME.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:33.951
RENO GOALS AND TWO THIRDS WERE

00:42:34.018 --> 00:42:35.185
NOT MANY ANY INCOME CORRECT.

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:36.921
THAT CREATES ITS OWN MOMENTUM IN

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.088
TERMS OF PEOPLE HAVING THEIR

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:40.424
EYES OPENED TO WHAT'S REALLY

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.092
GOING ON SO IT DOESN'T ATTER BY

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:44.261
ITSELF OBVIOUSLY BUT IT DOES.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:48.699
CREATE POLITICAL MOMENTUM FOR

00:42:48.766 --> 00:42:51.402
CHANGE.

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:52.670
I CENTER DRIVE SEVEN CENTER WHAT

00:42:52.736 --> 00:42:52.903
COUNTS.

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.538
THANK YOU -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:58.008
A MEMBER GRAYSON AYE I DO HAVE.

00:42:58.075 --> 00:42:59.376
RELATED QUESTION TO WHAT HAS

00:42:59.443 --> 00:43:00.411
JUST BEEN SAID.

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:02.279
AND THAT IS THAT -- THERE ARE AT

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:05.816
LEAST FIVE TOTAL BILLS FOR OTHER

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:07.651
BILLS THAT HAVE TO DO WITH.

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:12.222
DATA COLLECTION -- AND THE SO

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:14.058
WHILE ON THE ONE HAND THERE ARE

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.659
BILLS THAT WE ARE HEARING IN

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:18.762
VOTING ON THAT CUT OUT THE STEPS.

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.397
IN THE PROCESS SO WE CAN MAKE

00:43:20.464 --> 00:43:22.900
SURE WE ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THE

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:26.003
BUILDING AND MAKING IT EASIER --

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.305
SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS HOW DO

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:29.974
WE MAKE SURE OUR FOCUS IN OUR

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.141
RESOURCES.

00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:33.243
DON'T GET SO CAUGHT UP ON THE

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:35.212
INFORMATION SIDE AND I AGREE I

00:43:35.279 --> 00:43:37.281
UNDERSTAND THE POWER OF

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:40.384
INFORMATION BUT HOW DO WE DEAL

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.685
WITH FIVE DIFFERENT.

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:43.387
BILLS.

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.254
THAT.

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.589
IS RELATED THEY'RE NOT

00:43:45.656 --> 00:43:47.558
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:49.159
AND MAYBE DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:51.228
TO THAT BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:52.663
ALL FIVE BILLS GET PAST.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.466
AND SIGNED AND THEN.

00:43:55.532 --> 00:43:57.034
THAT'S FIVE DIFFERENT.

00:43:57.101 --> 00:43:59.203
WAYS OF COLLECTING THAT DATA --

00:43:59.269 --> 00:44:01.672
AND I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:03.574
MUCH MORE.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.676
HILL FRUGAL ABOUT OUR RESOURCES

00:44:05.743 --> 00:44:09.279
AND OUR FOCUS -- BECAUSE WE'RE

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.115
CUTTING OUT OTHER STEPS BECAUSE

00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:13.617
WE SAY IT'S TOO BURDENSOME I

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.452
MEAN WE'RE EVEN SACRIFICING

00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:17.955
ELEMENTS OF SEQUEL -- SO I JUST

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.390
IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT OR MAKE

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:21.959
A SUGGESTION -- SUPPORT OF BUT

00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:23.027
I'M CONCERNED THAT ADDRESS A

00:44:23.093 --> 00:44:24.294
THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING THEIR

00:44:24.361 --> 00:44:25.996
CONCERN AND WE DID LOOK AT THAT

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:27.598
AND WE ARE AWARE OF THE OTHER

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:29.266
BILLS -- HOWEVER WHEN YOU LOOK

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:31.335
AT THE OTHER BILLS AS AS WELL

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:32.669
INTENDED IN AS GOOD AS THEY ARE

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.138
AND THEY SORT OF AN INCREDIBLE

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.672
PURPOSE FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

00:44:35.739 --> 00:44:37.441
THEY'RE VERY SPECIFIED TO THE

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:39.143
DATA COLLECTION THAT THEY ARE

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:41.245
CALLING FOR FOR INSTANCE A BILL

00:44:41.311 --> 00:44:43.680
THAT'S THIS VERY SPECIFIC AND

00:44:43.747 --> 00:44:45.182
NARROW TO JUST FARM WORKER

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:46.116
HOUSING.

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:46.617
AND THAT'S THE DATA THE

00:44:46.683 --> 00:44:48.552
COLLECTING IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.921
CASE WE ARE COLLECTING A BROAD

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:52.322
ACROSS THE BOARD THE STATE OF

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:53.424
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.159
AS FAR AS HOUSING AND HOW IT'S

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:57.428
BEING APPROVED ON A CITY LEVEL

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.730
OR A COUNTY LEVEL -- SO IT

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:02.332
COVERS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM HI I

00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.201
AM VERY SENSITIVE -- TO CENTERED

00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:05.936
MORE LOCK AND WHAT HE HAD

00:45:06.003 --> 00:45:10.307
SUGGESTED ABOUT TRYING TO GATHER

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:14.211

GATHERING DATA IN A WAY THAT WE

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:19.983
CAN -- AGGREGATE IT AND BE ABLE

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:21.118
TO DISSEMINATE IN A PRODUCTIVE

00:45:21.185 --> 00:45:22.519
WAY RATHER THAN JUST KEEPING

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:25.255
PEOPLE BUSY AND CREATING MORE

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:25.956
WEIGHT AND HEAVY.

00:45:26.023 --> 00:45:27.191
HEAVY LOAD AND IF I MAY KNOW WE

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:29.093

MISSION ARE HARMONIZED AND THEY

00:45:41.605 --> 00:45:42.906
COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER AND DON'T

00:45:42.973 --> 00:45:44.241
CREE DUPLICATION.

00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.576
SIMILAR TO THE E. D. U.

00:45:45.642 --> 00:45:47.578
SITUATION THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

THIS IS THE REQUIREMENTS OF

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:55.205
AS A RESULT WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS A

00:52:55.272 --> 00:52:56.740
RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES IF

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:58.475

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.281
WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO CAN'T GET

LOANS ARE ACCESS HOME EQUITY AND

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:10.554
WE HAVE HOMEOWNERS WHO CAN'T GET

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.588
BUILDING PERMITS FROM THE STATE.

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.889
IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE TWO WAYS

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:14.925
OF TITLING A REGISTERING HOMES

00:53:14.991 --> 00:53:16.826
ONE IS I. L. T. THEIN LIEU OF

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:19.696
TAX WHICH IS PAID TO H. CD.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:21.231
THE OTHER IS L. P. T. WHICH IS

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:23.199
LOCAL PROPERTY TAX PAID TO

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:24.434
COUNTY TAX COLLECTOR'S.

00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:26.169
THERE'S AT LEAST A FIFTY FIFTY

00:53:26.236 --> 00:53:28.405
SPLIT BUT THE L. P. T..

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:31.508
PROPERTY TAX IS BECOMING MORE --

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:34.110
NUMEROUS BECAUSE A NEW HOMES ARE

00:53:34.177 --> 00:53:35.779
AUTOMATICALLY L. P. T..

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:36.846
AND HOMES CAN ALSO BE

00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:39.516
TRANSFERRED TO A P. T. TO AVOID

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.350
SALES USE TAX.

00:53:40.417 --> 00:53:41.651
ALTHOUGH THE PENETRATION OF THE

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.520
PROGRAM HASN'T BEEN AS GOOD AS

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:45.622
WE DESIRE IN GSM WELL IN OUR

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:48.124
SISTER OF FIVE OH ONE C. THREE

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.160
ARE VERY COMMITTED -- TO BETTER

OUT REGION EDUCATION ESPECIALLY

00:53:52.195 --> 00:53:53.463
TO HISPANIC AND VIETNAMESE

00:53:53.530 --> 00:53:54.798
HOMEOWNERS.

00:53:54.864 --> 00:53:56.366
WHO CAN BE VERY WARY AND

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:58.435
DISTRUSTING OF ANY KIND OF

00:53:58.501 --> 00:54:00.704
GOVERNMENT -- OR ANYTHING

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.105
RELATED TO GOVERNMENT.

00:54:02.172 --> 00:54:04.007
BUT WE DO HAVE STATISTICS AS OF

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:07.110
MARCH SHOWING -- ALMOST TWO

00:54:07.177 --> 00:54:08.545
THOUSAND COMPLETED APPLICATIONS.

00:54:08.612 --> 00:54:10.480
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:12.882
THE L. P. T. COUNTY APPLICATIONS

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:14.150
ARE FEWER.

00:54:14.217 --> 00:54:16.419
THERE WAS A TWO HUNDRED AND

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:18.421

AND AND TAXES WITH 62%.

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:27.731
SO KEEPING THE LOCAL PROPERTY

00:54:27.797 --> 00:54:30.533
TAX UNITS AS PART OF THE PROCESS

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:32.002
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.303

TREASURER'S AND TAX COLLECTORS --

00:56:20.944 --> 00:56:21.978
WHEN THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS PUT

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.346
THROUGH I HAVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO

00:56:23.413 --> 00:56:24.981

CRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WE THOUGHT

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:32.122

BY A SINGLE OWNER.

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:47.837
SINCE THAT BILL WAS PASSED

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.572
WITHOUT OUR SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS.

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.374
WE HAVE LEARNED IN THE LAST

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:52.509

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.955
A VERY LITTLE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.824
AND THEN THE PARK HONOR OBTAINS

00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.592
OWNERSHIP OF THAT HOME.

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:11.594

THE AMNESTY PROGRAM THAT HAS NOT

BEEN ACCEPTED WERE CONCERNED

00:57:33.183 --> 00:57:34.818
THAT THE BILL THAT WAS INITIALLY

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:36.119
PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WAS

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.554

UNITS ARE PROPERLY TITLE.

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.140
ON YOU KNOW I THINK IN MANY

00:59:37.206 --> 00:59:38.207
INSTANCES.

00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:40.043
THE UNITS THAT WERE TALKING

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.644
ABOUT ARE IN FACT OWNED BY THE

00:59:41.711 --> 00:59:44.347
PARK OWNERS. TO OUR YOU KNOW

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:46.382
WHETHER THEY HAVE BEEN ABANDONED

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:47.784
UNITS OR OTHERWISE STATE

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:48.851
NEVERTHELESS THEY STILL ONLY

00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:50.053
UNITS AND AND I THINK THAT'S

00:59:50.119 --> 00:59:51.554
WHAT THE FOCUS OUGHT TO BE.

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:52.956
A WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EACH ONE

00:59:53.022 --> 00:59:54.290
OF THESE UNITS IS PROPERLY

00:59:54.357 --> 00:59:55.558
TITLES SO THAT THEY COULD BE

00:59:55.625 --> 00:59:57.593
TRANSFERRED ALL LEGALLY

00:59:57.660 --> 00:59:59.295
OTHERWISE AS WE HEARD FROM THE

00:59:59.362 --> 00:59:59.862

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:00.964
YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:04.100
ISSUES THAT COULD ARISE FROM MOM

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:06.169
ALL TITLES THAT HAVE CLOUT OF

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:07.603
FOR EXAMPLE THEY GET EVICTED

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.672
THEY THEY CAN'T PAY -- TO THEY

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:10.273
CAN'T.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.674
DO ANYTHING WITH IT THEY CAN'T

01:00:11.741 --> 01:00:12.275
TRANSFER SO THAT'S THE

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.543
UNDERLYING ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:00:13.609 --> 01:00:15.211
DEALING WITH AND SO SO THE FOCUS

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.213

HOMES IN THE PARK AS AN

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.063
INCENTIVE.

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.598
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DEAL WITH

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:36.199

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.646
BILL IS DESIGNED TO SET UP THE

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.315
GRANT PROGRAM THEN WE CAN

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:34.316
ADVOCATE FOR AN APPROPRIATION

01:22:34.382 --> 01:22:35.717
THE BUDGET NEXT YEAR AS WELL

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:37.218
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:37.952

01:22:47.228 --> 01:22:48.063
YEARS.

01:22:48.129 --> 01:22:49.698
SO WE'RE JUST SETTING SOMETHING

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.833
UP WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.935

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:56.071
NOT ON GOING DEDICATED FOR THE

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:57.205
SPECIFIC PROGRAM IT'S JUST

01:22:57.272 --> 01:22:59.207
MINISTERIAL.

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:02.310
NO HOPE FOR ANYTHING IT'S ALWAYS

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:04.279

MINE IS A TECHNICAL ISSUE AND

01:23:30.472 --> 01:23:31.973
AND I'M I'M I'M.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.274
I'M GONNA HAVE.

01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:34.576
TO MENTION IT A NUMBER OF TIMES

01:23:34.642 --> 01:23:36.478
TODAY BECAUSE THERE ARE A NUMBER

01:23:36.544 --> 01:23:39.614
OF BILLS THAT -- THAT START TO

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:43.017
BUILD -- UPON.

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.419
COUNCILS ARE COMMITTEES THAT

WERE SET UP TO DO SOME SOME --

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.523
SOME TECHNICAL WORK BUT REALLY

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.359
DON'T HAVE ANY -- EXPERIENCE IN

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:54.462
HANDLING GRANT -- APPLICATIONS

01:23:54.529 --> 01:23:56.097
IN THE WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:57.699
THAT'S REQUIRED TO DO REVIEWING

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.634
GRANTS -- AND HAVING COME FROM

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:01.202
THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE I'M

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:03.004
REALLY SENSITIVE TO THIS BECAUSE

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:03.838
WHEN YOU START BUILDING THE

01:24:03.905 --> 01:24:05.340
BUREAUCRACY THEN YOU SPEND MORE

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:06.708
MONEY ON THE BUREAUCRACY THAN

01:24:06.775 --> 01:24:08.109
YOU ACTUALLY SPENT.

01:24:08.176 --> 01:24:09.177
ON GRANTS TO THE LOCAL

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:10.812
GOVERNMENT AND SO THIS THE

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:11.846
HOMELESS COORDINATING AND

01:24:11.913 --> 01:24:13.481
FINANCING COUNCIL WAS SET UP

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:14.516
LAST YEAR.

01:24:14.582 --> 01:24:16.618
AND AND AND THIS YEAR

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.019
EVERYBODY'S THROWING THEM A LOT

01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:19.988
OF WORK FOR THEM TO DO AND I'M

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.556
JUST CONCERNED WITH GIVING THEM

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:22.657
UP AB FAB.

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:23.858
PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:25.760
TO DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER GRANT

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.462
PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S A DIFFERENT.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.798
IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ON

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:32.033
ANIMAL AND THIS THIS IS LOCATED

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.601
IN AN AGENCY.

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:35.670
WHICH AT THE AGENCY LEVEL YOU

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:37.939
DON'T DO GRANTS GENERALLY AND SO

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:38.473
I'M JUST I'M A LITTLE BIT

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.441
WORRIED ABOUT IT.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:40.608
FRANKLY I THINK IT GOES BETTER

01:24:40.675 --> 01:24:42.143
AT EACH CD OR ANY OF THE HOUSING

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.279
AGENCIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:48.149
WITH WITH -- CREATING THE

01:24:48.216 --> 01:24:48.883
GUIDELINES FOR GRANT. FOR

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.118

01:25:02.363 --> 01:25:03.198
WERE GOING TO DO AND THAT'S A

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:04.799
WHOLE INFRASTRUCTURE WITH

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.568
ACCOUNTABILITY BUILT IN THAT.

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:07.435
IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

01:25:07.502 --> 01:25:09.070

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:10.305

WRONG PLACE SO -- A RESERVES THE

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:21.382

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:25.553
I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR MEMBERS

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:34.929
HOUSING CHALLENGE.

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.197
THE WAY WE LOOK AT IT OUR

01:35:36.263 --> 01:35:37.331
MEMBERS SPECIAL DISTRICTS

01:35:37.398 --> 01:35:39.033
THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE PROVIDE

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.801
ESSENTIAL LOCAL SERVICES TO THE

01:35:40.868 --> 01:35:42.169
COMMUNITIES.

01:35:42.236 --> 01:35:43.971
THAT DEPEND ON THOSE SERVICES

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:45.439
FOR AN AFFORDABLE WAY OF LIVING

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:48.008
SO JUST AS ONE MUST HAVE AN

01:35:48.075 --> 01:35:48.976
AFFORDABLE.

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:50.711
JUST PRICE ON A HOME OR RENTAL

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:51.846
PRICE FOR A HOME.

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:53.481
THE AMOUNT THAT ONE PAYS FOR

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:55.616
WATER FOR WASTE WATER FOR FIRE

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:56.984
PROTECTION FOR THESE BASIC

01:35:57.051 --> 01:35:59.386
ESSENTIAL SERVICES IS JUST AS A

01:35:59.453 --> 01:36:01.922
CENTRAL. TO AFFORDABLE LIVING AS

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:02.957
AN AFFORDABLE PURCHASE PRICE ON

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.658
A HOME AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.093
STANCE THAT WE COME HERE WITH

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.728
AND WHY WE ARE SO CONCERNED

01:36:07.795 --> 01:36:10.064
ABOUT WANTING TO FIND A SOLUTION

01:36:10.131 --> 01:36:10.764
THAT.

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:11.899
BOTH PROVIDES FOR AFFORDABLE

01:36:11.966 --> 01:36:14.034
HOUSING AND PROVIDES FOR

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:15.870
AFFORDABLE LIVING -- AND THAT'S

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:16.971
WHT OUR MEMBERS ARE SEEKING TO

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:18.105
DO SO THAT LEADS US TO OUR

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.640
CONCERNS WE HAVE THREE MAJOR

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:21.742
CONCERNS -- THAT WE BELIEVE ARE

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.878
REMAINING -- AND THE FIRST AND

01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:25.412
FOREMOST IS WITH REGARD TO THE

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:26.780
NEW DEFINITIOS IN THE BILL AND

01:36:26.847 --> 01:36:28.115
PARTICULARLY THE WORD.

01:36:28.182 --> 01:36:30.985
I USE -- WE BELIEVE THAT THE WAY

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:32.119
THAT IT'S CURRENTLY DEFINED

01:36:32.186 --> 01:36:34.021
UNNECESSARILY LIMITS THE LOCAL

01:36:34.088 --> 01:36:36.757
FLEXIBILITY -- AND CREATES

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.259
UNNECESSARY NEW LEGAL LIABILITY

01:36:38.325 --> 01:36:40.027
SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.362
ADDITIONAL EXEMPTIONS BUT RATHER

01:36:41.428 --> 01:36:42.796
SOLUTION THAT PROVIDES THAT

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:44.265
LOCAL FLEXIBILITY.

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:46.834
IN A WAY THAT DE AGENCIES CAN

01:36:46.901 --> 01:36:48.602
MEET THEIR MISSION AND WORK

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:49.904
WITHIN THEIR ENABLING ACT TO DO

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:52.573
SO -- ONE EXAMPLE.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.641
OF THE TYPE OF USE THAT WE'RE

01:36:53.707 --> 01:36:55.809
TALKING ABOUT WOULD BE AN AGENCY

01:36:55.876 --> 01:36:57.011
THAT WANTS.

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.380
TO SELL A LAND FOR A SOLAR

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:01.215
PROJECT WHERE BY THE AGENCY

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:02.483
WOULD THEN ENTER INTO A POWER

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.285
PURCHASE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR

01:37:04.351 --> 01:37:05.319
THE OUTPUT.

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:06.887
OF THAT PROJECT SO THAT'S JUST

01:37:06.954 --> 01:37:08.789
ONE EXAMPLE I KNOW MISS KING

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:09.957
WITH THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS --

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:11.926
WILL HAVE SOME OTHERS SECONDLY

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.527
AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX RESTRICT

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:15.162
THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL AGENCY TO

01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:17.464
PARTICIPATE IN EVEN IN FORMAL

01:37:17.531 --> 01:37:20.334
NEGOTIATIONS -- AT AND SO IN IN

01:37:20.401 --> 01:37:21.535
THE WORD NEGOTIATION IS NOT

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:24.071
DEFINED AND YOU COULD IMAGINE I

01:37:24.138 --> 01:37:26.807
CERTAINLY SENATORS -- YOU'VE

01:37:26.874 --> 01:37:28.008
BEEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE

01:37:28.075 --> 01:37:30.711
SOMEBODY BRINGS AN IDEA TO YOU --

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:31.412
THAT MIGHT BE OUTSIDE THE

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.346
FRAMEWORK.

01:37:32.413 --> 01:37:33.347
OF A TRADITIONAL HEARING OR

01:37:33.414 --> 01:37:34.949
MAYBE RIGHT BE IT RIGHT HERE AT

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:35.916
THIS HEARING I COME WITH A NEW

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:38.619
IDEA -- MAYBE YOU'RE WE WERE

01:37:38.686 --> 01:37:40.087
LIVING SOLICITING THAT IDEA HAVE

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:45.025
YOU JUST ENGAGED IN A

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.760
NEGOTIATION -- WHY IS THAT SO

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:47.795
CONCERNING THAT BRINGS US TO OUR

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:48.762
THIRD CONCERN AND THAT IS?

01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:49.630
NOT ONLY THE X. WILL IT REALLY

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:50.531
THE EXISTING LIABILITY WITHIN

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.399
LAW BUT THE EXPANDED LIABILITY

01:37:52.466 --> 01:37:53.467
THIS BILL WOULD CREATE

01:37:53.534 --> 01:37:54.902
PARTICULARLY WITH THE FINE THAT

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.970
IT ESTABLISHES.

01:37:56.036 --> 01:37:57.471
THIS BILL ESTABLISHES THIS IS

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:59.373
BRAND NEW A 50% FIND ON THE

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.408
VALUE OF THE LAND IF YOU MAKE A

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.010
MISTAKE WITH THE SURPLUS LAND

01:38:03.077 --> 01:38:03.644
ACT AND WE DO APPRECIATE THERE

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:04.278
ARE SOME.

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.946
SOME SAFE HARBORS AND THINGS

01:38:06.013 --> 01:38:06.814
LIKE THAT WITHIN THE WITHIN THE

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.949
BILL BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:10.918
SOME OF THESE AGENCIES THEY'RE

01:38:10.985 --> 01:38:12.219
NEGOTIATING THE SALES.

01:38:12.286 --> 01:38:14.221
MIGHT BE VERY SMALL AGENCIES WE

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:15.556
HAVE SOME THAT MIGHT HAVE A

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:16.857
THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN SOME

01:38:16.924 --> 01:38:18.692
INSTANCES PARTICULAR WITH THE

01:38:18.759 --> 01:38:20.594
VALUE OF LAND AS IT IS WE MIGHT

01:38:20.661 --> 01:38:21.996
HAVE AN AGENCY SELLING A PLOT OF

01:38:22.062 --> 01:38:23.397
LAND THAT MIGHT BE WORTH MORE

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:24.832
THAN THE ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET.

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:27.601
OF AN AGENCY AND SO A 50% FINE

01:38:27.668 --> 01:38:29.003
ON THE VALUE OF THAT LAND COULD

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:30.871
BE DEVASTATING TO AN AGENCY.

01:38:30.938 --> 01:38:32.273
THAT'S JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:38:32.339 --> 01:38:33.173
HOW TO THEY SELL THIS LAND THE

01:38:33.240 --> 01:38:34.575
RIGHT WAY AND THEY CAN'T

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:36.010
NAVIGATE A COMPLICATED SURPLUS

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:37.411
LAND THAT THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE A

01:38:37.478 --> 01:38:38.279
IN HOUSE ATTORNEY.

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:39.713
IT'S ASSISTING THEM WITH THIS

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.081
PURCHASE OR THE CELL SO THOSE

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:42.283
ARE THE TYPES OF CONCERNS OR

01:38:42.349 --> 01:38:44.218
WORKING THROUGH -- I HOPE THAT

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.220
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND OUR OUR

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:48.155
DESIRE TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND

01:38:48.222 --> 01:38:49.590
CONSTRUCTIVE IN GOOD FAITH.

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.859
WITH THAT I WILL -- REST MY CASE

OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE

01:38:59.933 --> 01:39:00.501
DISTRICTS ALSO ONE I THINK THE

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:01.101
AUTHOR AND SPONSOR FOR WORKING

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:01.635
WITH THE COALITION AND OUR

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:02.603
OPPOSITION.

01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.937
HOW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:05.706
HAS REALLY GREAT INTENTIONS BUT

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:06.674
THERE ARE A FEW UNINTENDED

01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:08.909
CONSEQUENCES SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:10.377
OUR HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THAT

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:12.146
ARE SOMEWHAT UNIQUE -- WE

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.147
BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:14.548
APPLY TO OUR DISTRICTS THAT

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:16.283
WOULD SELL HOSPITAL OR CLINIC OR

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:17.851
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THAT

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.353
HAS AN EXISTING BUILDING ON IT.

01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:20.821
MOST OF THE TIMES ARE DISTRICTS

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:21.755
WILL SELL THOSE AT THEIR IN

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:23.357
FINANCIAL DISTRESS WHERE THEY

01:39:23.424 --> 01:39:25.225
WILL LOOK AT LEASING AND MOST OF

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.527
THOSE CASES THEY WILL START

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:27.628
NEGOTIATING WITH HEALTH CARE

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:28.729
ENTITIES.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.931
VERY EARLY ON WE'RE CONCERNED

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.499
THAT ARE DISTRICTS WOULD NO

01:39:32.566 --> 01:39:34.234
LONGER BE ABLE TO DO THAT IF

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:35.369
THIS BILL WERE TO GO FORWARD

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:36.770
THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:38.505
THE INITIAL PROCESS THAT SET UP

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:39.807
IN THE BILL BEFORE THEY CAN

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.942
START TALKING TO THEIR DISTRICTS

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.410
AND AS MISTER PUTNAM ALREADY

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:44.278
MENTIONED.

01:39:44.345 --> 01:39:45.979
THE THREAT OF A LAWSUIT AND THE

01:39:46.046 --> 01:39:47.481
THREAT OF THE PENALTIES IN THE

01:39:47.548 --> 01:39:48.849
BILL ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:39:48.916 --> 01:39:50.217
ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF OUR SMALL

01:39:50.284 --> 01:39:51.251
RURAL DISTRICTS.

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:52.519
THAT MAY ALREADY BE IN FINANCIAL

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:54.355
DISTRESS AND SO WE'RE HOPING TO

01:39:54.421 --> 01:39:55.889
WORK WITH THE AUTHOR ON SOME OF

01:39:55.956 --> 01:39:58.258
THOSE ISSUES ADDITIONALLY WE ARE

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.760
ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:01.195

TEN MILLION DOLLARS IS LOU IS

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:51.064
THE WATER DISTRICT ENTITLED TO

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.567
EXPECT THAT MARKET VALUE. TO BE

01:47:53.633 --> 01:47:55.001

AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER YES

01:47:58.905 --> 01:47:59.506
THAN THE MARKET VALUE.

01:47:59.573 --> 01:48:02.742
AND I'M SORRY -- AND AND THE LAW

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:05.078

CRYSTAL CLEAR.

01:48:18.658 --> 01:48:20.093
THAT YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO

01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.062
SELL THE LAND BELOW MARKET VALUE

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:24.865
PERFECT WELL I LOOK FORWARD TO

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:25.966

YOU JUST HAVE TO GIVE THE FOR

01:48:37.644 --> 01:48:39.179
THE HOUSING DEVELOPERS THE FIRST

01:48:39.246 --> 01:48:40.280
RIGHT OF REFUSAL.

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:41.581
SO IF YOU GIVE THEM THE FIRST

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:44.150
REFUSAL NOBODY COMES FORWARD

01:48:44.217 --> 01:48:46.119
THEN YOU CAN AGAIN SO IT TO

WE HAVE A SENATOR CAFIERO THAT

01:48:49.823 --> 01:48:51.324
WOULD LIKE TO INTERROGATE I MEAN

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:53.093
ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.062
TO LET ME SAY THAT I I REALLY

01:48:56.129 --> 01:48:57.964
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

01:48:58.031 --> 01:49:00.166
DO BECAUSE THE THE ISSUE IS

01:49:00.233 --> 01:49:02.535
REALLY VERY VERY SIMPLE WHICH IS

01:49:02.602 --> 01:49:05.872
SAID IF YOU'RE GOING. TO RELIEVE

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:06.907
YOURSELF.

01:49:06.973 --> 01:49:09.009
OF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY

01:49:09.075 --> 01:49:11.111
AND YOU'RE IN THEM.

01:49:11.177 --> 01:49:12.646
IN GOVERNMENT THAT THAT YOU HAVE

01:49:12.712 --> 01:49:13.947
TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS I THINK

01:49:14.014 --> 01:49:16.216
THE KEY HERE GETS BACK TO WHAT.

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:18.351
THE DEFINITION OF SURPLUS IS AND

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:20.387
HOW YOU IDENTIFY IT IS SURPLUS

01:49:20.453 --> 01:49:23.256
SO -- I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY

01:49:23.323 --> 01:49:25.992
HERE TODAY BECAUSE OUR OUR

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:27.894
COMMITTEE REPORT.

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:30.430
HAD NO DETAIL ON THE SPECIFICS

01:49:30.497 --> 01:49:33.466
AND YOU MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT

01:49:33.533 --> 01:49:35.001
YOU WANT TO BE ABLE.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:35.602
TO BECAUSE YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:36.903
RIGHT THERE ARE THERE ARE TIMES

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:38.338
WHEN PEOPLE SHOW UP AND THEY SAY

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:39.940
HEY I'VE GOT AN IDEA FOR THAT

01:49:40.006 --> 01:49:40.807
PIECE OF PROPERTY.

01:49:40.874 --> 01:49:42.943
AND TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

01:49:43.009 --> 01:49:45.045
THAT SHOULDN'T IS IT SHOULDN'T

01:49:45.111 --> 01:49:46.713
ABOUT -- IN ORDER TO THE

01:49:46.780 --> 01:49:48.114
DETRIMENT OF THEIR SPECIAL

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:49.582
DISTRICT OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:51.451
AND SO I THINK IF WE GET A

01:49:51.518 --> 01:49:53.753
REALLY GOOD DEFINITION WHICH I

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.956
THINK IS WHAT YOU WERE GETTING

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:58.625
TO OF WHAT IS DETERMINED TO BE

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:01.594
SURPLUS -- THEN THAT AND IT'S A

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:04.130
BRIGHT LINE THEN YOU YOU START

01:50:04.197 --> 01:50:06.333
TO PROTECT ALL THESE OTHER

01:50:06.399 --> 01:50:07.334
THINGS THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.768
ABOUT OUR AND ARE NO LONGER OF

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:11.671
CONCERN BECAUSE YOU'VE MADE IT

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:13.273
VERY CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:15.675
SOME ACTION THAT IDENTIFIES IT

01:50:15.742 --> 01:50:16.810
AS SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:17.077
TO SELL.

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:19.579
OR OR GET RID OF AND AND AND

01:50:19.646 --> 01:50:21.448
THEN IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:24.050
BECOMES A LITTLE BABIES YOURSELF.

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:25.752
THAT I THINK -- I'M PREPARED TO

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:27.420
SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO WANT

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:29.556
TO SEE WHAT THE DEAF AND I WAS

01:50:29.622 --> 01:50:31.024

01:50:31.091 --> 01:50:32.726
OF SURPLUS AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.394
REFERS TO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:37.097
BILL AND I I I JUST WANNA MAKE

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:38.365
SURE THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT.

01:50:38.431 --> 01:50:43.370
THAT -- AND I LOOK AT MY LOCAL

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:44.871
GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE AND THERE

01:50:44.938 --> 01:50:46.339

WHERE WE SAT ON PROPERTY FOR

01:50:48.041 --> 01:50:50.176
YEARS AND WE SAT ON IT BECAUSE

01:50:50.243 --> 01:50:51.811
WE HAD THIS GREAT IDEA.

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:53.146
THE ECONOMY WENT DOWN THAT THE

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:55.081
TANK AND WE COULDN'T GET ANY

01:50:55.148 --> 01:50:56.750

LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WHERE ALL

THE ESSENCE OF THE BILL WHICH IS.

01:51:59.946 --> 01:52:01.181
WHY I DECIDE TO CARRY IT OF

01:52:01.247 --> 01:52:02.115
COURSE WHAT YOU SAID TO CARRY

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.516
THE BILL YOU REALIZE IT'S A MUCH

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.218
MUCH MORE COMPLEX WHICH IS WHY

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:05.819
THERE'S ALL THE SURPLUS LAND

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:06.853
LYING AROUND THAT?

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:09.355
HASN'T BEEN BUILT AND NOT AND

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.291
STORE NEAR AS COMPLEX AS WATER

01:52:11.357 --> 01:52:12.859
BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE IS

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.027
NO.

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:15.428
GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR SPECIAL

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:16.996
DISTRICT THAT EVER THINKS THEIR

01:52:17.063 --> 01:52:19.065
LAND A SURPLUS THEY HAVE SOME

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.567
VISION OF GRANDEUR.

01:52:20.633 --> 01:52:21.701
FOREVER AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:22.969
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN IN SAN

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:23.803
FRANCISCO AND THEY'VE HAD

01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:26.172
VISIONS OF GRANDEUR OF HOUSING.

01:52:26.239 --> 01:52:27.841
FOR TEACHERS.

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:29.542
FOR DECADES I WANT TO SAY THAT

01:52:29.609 --> 01:52:31.077
THIS CAN BE A VACANT LAND GOING

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:32.612
ON TWO THREE FOUR DECADES WILL

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:33.613
BE COULD HAVE.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:34.848
ACTUALLY HAD HOUSING FOR

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:39.853
TEACHERS ON INTO OUR OUR

01:52:39.919 --> 01:52:41.554
DEFINITION IS.

01:52:41.621 --> 01:52:43.690
AT THAT THE LAND BECOME SURPLUS

01:52:43.756 --> 01:52:44.757
WHEN THE AGENCIES DECIDE TO

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:45.825
DISPOSE OF IT -- THE CHALLENGES

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.360
YOU HAVE AGENCIES THAT NEVER

01:52:47.427 --> 01:52:48.995
EVER GO THROUGH.

01:52:49.062 --> 01:52:51.564
THAT CATALOG OF DEFINING WHAT IS

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:53.299
SURPLUS AND WHAT IS NOT SO I

01:52:53.366 --> 01:52:54.834
THINK WHAT WE TRY TO DO.

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:57.070
IN THE LEGISLATION IS TO IS TO

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.271
TRY.

01:52:58.338 --> 01:52:59.672
TO HAVE THAT LINE AND I THINK

01:52:59.739 --> 01:53:01.307
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS FOR A

01:53:01.374 --> 01:53:03.510
NUMBER OF DISTRICTS ARE AGENCIES

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:04.844
THAT NEVER WENT THROUGH THAT

01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.579
DIALOGUE GETS A LITTLE BIT.

01:53:06.646 --> 01:53:08.014
CONCERNING BECAUSE THEN IT MIGHT

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.849
FORCE THEIR HAND A LITTLE BIT SO

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:11.484
I THINK WE WE ARE TRYING.

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:13.119
TO FIND SOME MIDDLE GROUND ON

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:14.521
WHAT THE OTHER THING IS AN AND I

01:53:14.587 --> 01:53:15.588
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

01:53:15.655 --> 01:53:17.023
THAT IN IN THE INSTANCE THAT YOU

01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:19.225
GIVE THERE MAY BE THERE MAY BE

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:20.293
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.128
INTERESTED IN USING THEIR

01:53:22.195 --> 01:53:25.298
PROPERTY. FOR FOR HOUSING FOR

01:53:25.365 --> 01:53:26.833
YOU KNOW THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE FOR

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.136
AFFORDABLE OR FOR WORKFORCE --

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:33.072
BUT THERE MAY BE A HYBRID. TO BE

01:53:33.139 --> 01:53:34.874
ABLE TO SAY IN THE INSTANCE

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:36.209
WHERE YOU HAVE PROPERTY THAT

01:53:36.276 --> 01:53:38.978
YOU'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE --

01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:41.014
BILL WERE FOR HOUSING COULD

01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:43.483
REASONABLY BE BUILT -- THAT YOU

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:46.519
CAN NEGOTIATE WITH THE NONPROFIT

01:53:46.586 --> 01:53:50.490
DEVELOPER FOR THE PROVISION OF

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:51.191
HOUSING.

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:52.225
THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THE

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:53.326
PARTICULAR COMMUNITY AND SO.

01:53:53.393 --> 01:53:54.727
SO YOU MAY HAVE SURPLUS IT YOU

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:55.862
HAVE TO SELL BUT YOU ALSO MAY

01:53:55.929 --> 01:53:56.930
HAVE PROPERTY THAT YOU WANT TO

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.097
MAKE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S WHAT

01:53:58.164 --> 01:53:59.799
WHAT I'M HOPING THE STATE WILL

01:53:59.866 --> 01:54:01.301
DO BECAUSE THERE ARE PROPERTIES.

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.136
THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR A

01:54:03.203 --> 01:54:04.571
REALLY LONG TIME THAT ARE IN.

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:06.272
TIME LOCATIONS WHERE HOUSING

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:07.473
COULD BE BUILT.

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:09.676
AND TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE AS A

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:10.443
PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE ANOTHER

01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:11.211
OPTION.

01:54:11.277 --> 01:54:12.278
WELL WE WE DO THAT IN MY

01:54:12.345 --> 01:54:12.979

TEN TEN PARCELS IN SAN FRANCISCO

01:54:21.154 --> 01:54:21.854
THAT ARE.

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:24.290

01:55:47.473 --> 01:55:49.676
GROWING EXPONENTIALLY AND THE

GENERAL FUND HAVE ENOUGH COVER

01:55:51.878 --> 01:55:53.246

CONDITIONS THAT ARE IMPOSED WITH

02:35:37.795 --> 02:35:38.796
THE UTILIZATION OF THE TOOL

02:35:38.862 --> 02:35:40.164
REALLY MAKE IT UNTENABLE FOR

02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:04.088

02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:07.157

02:36:25.075 --> 02:36:25.609
THERE'S THERE'S OTHER ISSUES

02:36:25.676 --> 02:36:27.044
WITHOUT THAT INCENTIVE THAT JUST

02:36:27.111 --> 02:36:28.645

02:36:31.215 --> 02:36:32.216

LABOR SHED.

02:43:51.721 --> 02:43:52.856
AND PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:54.591
WERE ALTHOUGH FREQUENTLY THE

02:43:54.658 --> 02:43:56.059
FOCUS HAS BEEN ON PROVIDE

FARM WORKER FAMILY HOUSING.

02:44:03.066 --> 02:44:06.236
THAT'S WHY THIS BILL ATTEMPTS.

02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:08.705
TO EMPHASIZE THAT NEED AND SO TO

02:44:08.772 --> 02:44:10.173
GET TO YOU KNOW CLEARLY AGE TO A

02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:11.608
IS A FEDERAL PROGRAM.

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:13.910
THAT WE AS A STATE LEGISLATURE

02:44:13.977 --> 02:44:16.446
WE CANNOT CONTROL -- BUT YOU

02:44:16.513 --> 02:44:18.715
KNOW AND WE CAN'T TELL SOMEONE

02:44:18.782 --> 02:44:20.684
OF AN ACT OPERATE OR GROW OR

02:44:20.750 --> 02:44:21.952
WHETHER THE WE KNOW WHETHER AND

02:44:23.286 --> 02:44:24.988
NO THIS TEMPORARY WORKER PROGRAM

AND IT'S THROUGH THAT BUDGET

02:44:37.267 --> 02:44:38.602
PROCESS THAT I NOW UNDERSTAND

02:44:38.668 --> 02:44:40.337
THAT HOW OUR STATE SPENDS OUR

02:44:40.403 --> 02:44:41.738
MONEY.

02:44:41.805 --> 02:44:43.506
IS A REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES.

02:44:43.573 --> 02:44:46.142
AND SO CERTAINLY.

02:44:46.209 --> 02:44:48.478
WE DO HAVE A CHOICE AS A STATE

02:44:48.545 --> 02:44:49.980
WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO

02:44:50.046 --> 02:44:51.982
SUBSIDIZE -- THIS FEDERAL

02:48:15.285 --> 02:48:17.053
THE FAILURE TO ADDRESS.

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:18.855

REGARDLESS OF STATUS WHO THEY

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.312

OUT.

02:49:22.118 --> 02:49:24.754
IN IN OUR STAFF REPORTS ON PAGE

02:49:24.821 --> 02:49:25.822
THREE ONE OF THE MISSIONS THAT I

02:49:29.125 --> 02:49:30.426
THERE'S NO MENTION OF THE STATE

02:49:30.493 --> 02:49:31.895
WATER RESOURCES BOARD LET ME BE

02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:33.997

SYSTEM THAT'S THAT'S FEELING.

02:49:54.617 --> 02:49:55.885
SO THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT

02:49:55.952 --> 02:49:57.954
REQUIRES THE HOOK UP OF THESE

02:49:58.021 --> 02:50:01.491

02:51:15.698 --> 02:51:16.599
RELATED ISSUES.

02:51:16.666 --> 02:51:17.066
INCLUDING WELL WATER

02:51:17.133 --> 02:51:17.367
[inaudible]

02:51:17.433 --> 02:51:19.202
YES.

02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:22.639
OKAY -- MY NEXT QUESTION IS ON

02:51:22.705 --> 02:51:25.375
THE FIFTY FIVE YEAR PROVISION.

02:51:25.441 --> 02:51:26.409
WITH THE CHANGING FACE OF

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:28.745
AGRICULTURE.

02:51:28.811 --> 02:51:30.847
YOU ELIMINATE THE H. TWO

02:51:30.913 --> 02:51:33.116
INDIVIDUALS YOU ELIMINATE.

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:35.652
LOW INCOME WORKERS FROM LIVING

02:51:35.718 --> 02:51:37.153
IN THIS HOUSING IF.

02:51:37.220 --> 02:51:39.789
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE THE

02:51:39.856 --> 02:51:41.157
AGRICULTURE TRAINS CAN LOOK LIKE

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:43.192
BUT WHAT MECHANIZATION IT SEEMS

02:51:43.259 --> 02:51:44.694
TO ME THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE

02:51:44.761 --> 02:51:46.496
WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY FIVE YEARS

02:51:46.562 --> 02:51:48.297
FOR A JURISDICTION TO BE

02:51:48.364 --> 02:51:51.234
COMPLETELY PLANTED WITH.

02:51:51.300 --> 02:51:52.869
WITH CROPS THAT NO LONGER HAVE

02:51:52.935 --> 02:51:54.404
THE INTENSE.

02:51:54.470 --> 02:51:56.205
FARMWORKERS.

02:51:56.272 --> 02:51:58.007
NEEDS THAT I GREW UP WITH.

02:51:58.074 --> 02:52:00.143
AND THIS WOULD PROHIBIT AT LEAST

02:52:00.209 --> 02:52:01.678
THE WAY I READ IT WOULD PROHIBIT

02:52:01.744 --> 02:52:03.846
ANYBODY ELSE FROM LIVING IN THAT

02:52:03.913 --> 02:52:05.748
LOW INCOME HOUSING.

02:52:05.815 --> 02:52:07.850
JUST PUTTING THE ISSUE AND I

02:52:07.917 --> 02:52:08.651
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S YOUR

02:52:08.718 --> 02:52:10.520
INTENTION THAT IT'S ONLY GONNA

02:52:10.586 --> 02:52:12.488
BE THESE PEOPLE WHO THIS IS THE

02:52:12.555 --> 02:52:14.223
BUT THERE WILL BE THERE MAY BE

02:52:14.290 --> 02:52:15.925
OTHER FAMILIES THAT AREN'T.

02:52:15.992 --> 02:52:17.794
CONNECTED WITH AGRICULTURE IN

02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:19.862
WITHIN FIFTY FIVE YEARS THAT

02:52:19.929 --> 02:52:22.131
WOULD LIVE IN THIS.

02:52:22.198 --> 02:52:24.400
IN THIS HOUSING JUST.

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:25.034
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE

02:52:25.101 --> 02:52:28.738
YOUR GOAL.

02:52:28.805 --> 02:52:30.006
SO -- THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT

02:52:30.073 --> 02:52:32.075
STATUTES ALREADY THAT REQUIRE A

02:52:32.141 --> 02:52:33.743
FIFTY FIVE YEAR A REQUIREMENT

02:52:33.810 --> 02:52:34.944
FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING WE

02:52:35.011 --> 02:52:36.646
BELIEVE IT WAS APPROPRIATE TO

02:52:36.713 --> 02:52:38.047
REQUIRE A FIFTY FIVE YEAR --

02:52:38.114 --> 02:52:39.582
REQUIREMENT FOR FARMWORKERS

02:52:39.649 --> 02:52:40.850
HOUSING AS WELL TO BE CONSISTENT

02:52:40.917 --> 02:52:42.118
WITH THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:52:42.185 --> 02:52:43.686
BILLS SUCH AS PUBLIC RESOURCES

02:52:43.753 --> 02:52:45.788
CODE SECTION TWO ONE ONE FIVE

02:52:45.855 --> 02:52:47.190
FIVE POINT. ONE THIS IS A

02:52:47.256 --> 02:52:49.625
VOLUNTARY BILLS SO IF A PROPERTY

02:52:49.692 --> 02:52:51.394
OWNER IF A FARM OWNER DOES NOT

02:52:51.461 --> 02:52:52.595
BELIEVE THAT THERE AREAS GONNA

02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:55.064
SUPPORT FARMING FOR FIFTY FIVE

02:52:55.131 --> 02:52:56.466
YEARS AND DOES NOT HAVE.

02:52:56.532 --> 02:52:58.067
ENOUGH FARMWORKERS TO NEED THE

02:52:58.134 --> 02:52:59.836
HOUSING THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO

02:52:59.902 --> 02:53:02.105
USE THIS PROGRAM THEY CAN BUILD

02:53:02.171 --> 02:53:03.673
THE HOUSING UNDER EXISTING LAW

02:53:03.740 --> 02:53:04.774
WHERE THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:05.408
BUILD HOUSING.

02:53:05.475 --> 02:53:06.609
THIS IS YOU KNOW IS ONLY A

02:53:06.676 --> 02:53:08.211
VOLUNTARY PROGRAM FOR THOSE THAT

02:53:08.277 --> 02:53:10.780
BELIEVE IT FITS THEIR NEEDS.

02:53:10.847 --> 02:53:11.848
THAT'S RIGHT BECAUSE FARMERS

02:53:11.914 --> 02:53:12.982
HAVE NVER MADE A PREDICTION

02:53:13.049 --> 02:53:14.650
MISTAKE AS WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO

02:53:14.717 --> 02:53:16.352
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE I WOULD

02:53:16.419 --> 02:53:18.387
JUST SUGGEST THAT I DON'T SEE

02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:19.288
THERE'S ANY.

02:53:19.355 --> 02:53:24.694
DO WHICH ONE BUT THERE'S NO --

02:53:24.761 --> 02:53:25.728
PROBLEM OF SEEING IF THERE'S NOT

02:53:25.795 --> 02:53:26.662
AVAILABLE FARMWORKERS THERE THAT

02:53:26.729 --> 02:53:28.397
THE AGENCY COULD LOOK AT OTHER

02:53:28.464 --> 02:53:29.966
LOW INCOME PEOPLE WE DO THAT.

02:53:30.032 --> 02:53:31.167
AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS THAT

02:53:31.234 --> 02:53:32.235
PEOPLE TRY TO PUT ON

02:53:32.301 --> 02:53:33.803
PARTICULARLY -- LOW INCOME

02:53:33.870 --> 02:53:34.937
HOUSING BUT THOSE ARE MY

02:53:35.004 --> 02:53:39.008
OBSERVATIONS AND CONCERNS.

02:53:39.075 --> 02:53:40.943
THANK YOU.

02:53:41.010 --> 02:53:42.078
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER THERE

02:53:42.145 --> 02:53:42.445
ALSO.

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:46.315
A YES -- JUST ON THE ISSUE THE

02:53:46.382 --> 02:53:50.653
H. H. TO A CLEARLY THAT'S A

02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:53.689
FEDERAL PROGRAM AND I I THINK

02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:55.191
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS.

02:53:55.258 --> 02:53:56.159
ADDRESS THIS.

02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:57.827
WELL ONE OF THE WITNESSES IS

02:53:57.894 --> 02:54:00.563
IT'S A PROGRAM THAT REQUIRES THE

02:54:00.630 --> 02:54:04.167
EMPLOYER. TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF

02:54:04.233 --> 02:54:06.002
THINGS.

02:54:06.068 --> 02:54:08.638
THERE'S A BACK AND FORTH HERE

02:54:08.704 --> 02:54:11.374
THAT IF OF WORKERS ARE BROUGHT

02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.009
IN FROM OUT OF COUNTRY.

02:54:13.075 --> 02:54:14.710
THEN THEY HAVE TO BE PROVIDED

02:54:14.777 --> 02:54:15.878
WITH CERTAIN THINGS.

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:18.214
MEALS TRANSPORTATION.

02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:23.152
HOUSING -- I CAN IMAGINE THE THE

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:25.121
STATE GOVERNMENT THEN WOULD STEP

02:54:25.188 --> 02:54:26.989
IN TO PROVIDE ALL THESE THINGS

02:54:27.056 --> 02:54:29.859
WHICH ARE ALREADY A REQUIREMENT

02:54:29.926 --> 02:54:31.394
OF THIS OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM.

02:54:31.460 --> 02:54:34.397
SO I AND THERE IS.

BUT I DON'T THINK IT WERE DRAW

02:54:40.636 --> 02:54:42.371
THE LINE IS THAT SINCE IT'S

02:54:42.438 --> 02:54:45.007
ALREADY REQUIRED OF THE EMPLOYER.

02:54:45.074 --> 02:54:46.776
THROUGH THE FEDERAL PROGRAM WHY

02:54:46.843 --> 02:54:49.779

THAT HOUSING AND PAY FOR IT WHAT

02:54:51.214 --> 02:54:53.983
PIC PAY FOR THAT HOUSING -- WHEN

02:54:54.050 --> 02:54:55.318
IT'S ALREADY REQUIRED?

02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:57.887
IF YOU IF YOU APPLY AND SAY YOU

02:54:57.954 --> 02:54:59.922

02:55:05.228 --> 02:55:06.362
PERIOD.

02:55:06.429 --> 02:55:07.997
SO THIS HOUSING THAT WE WITH OUR

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:09.565
STATE DOLLARS WOULD.

02:55:09.632 --> 02:55:12.668
HELP -- IN A NUMBER OF WAYS WHAT

02:55:12.735 --> 02:55:14.303
IS STREAMLINING OR FUNDING

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:16.939
WHATEVER IT SEEMS TO BE OUT OF

02:55:17.006 --> 02:55:20.409
BE FOUR US THE OTHER FARMWORKERS --

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.511
IN BETTER THEY'RE WORKING IN THE

02:55:22.578 --> 02:55:24.847

ILL.

02:55:25.748 --> 02:55:28.517
ALWAYS BE FARMWORKERS THAT ARE

02:55:28.584 --> 02:55:32.221
NEEDED -- REGARDLESS -- TO MY

02:55:32.288 --> 02:55:35.825
COLLEAGUE OVER THERE -- THE FACT

02:55:35.892 --> 02:55:36.025
THAT.

02:55:36.092 --> 02:55:37.126
THERE IS.

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.161
THAT THERE ARE AGE TO A WORKERS

02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:41.931

02:55:49.138 --> 02:55:53.376
RIGHT ELEMENT. TO INCENTIVIZE OF

02:55:53.442 --> 02:55:55.478
HOUSING FOR FARMWORKER FAMILIES

02:55:55.544 --> 02:55:57.213
BUT ALSO DRAWS THE LINE AS TO

02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:58.681
HOW FAR WE'RE WILLING TO GO TO

02:55:58.748 --> 02:56:00.416
USE OUR TAX DOLLARS THANK YOU

02:56:00.483 --> 02:56:02.184
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS UP.

02:56:02.251 --> 02:56:06.055
AND I'M GLAD TO BE.

02:56:06.122 --> 02:56:08.090
SUPPORTIVE [inaudible]

02:56:08.157 --> 02:56:09.225
SENATOR BATES.

02:56:09.292 --> 02:56:10.793
JUST A QUICK COMMENT MAYBE A

02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:12.295
QUESTION WITH THAT.

02:56:12.361 --> 02:56:13.095
IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'VE ALMOST DE

02:56:13.162 --> 02:56:14.263
INCENTIVIZE THE VOLUNTARY

02:56:14.330 --> 02:56:14.830
PROGRAM.

02:56:14.897 --> 02:56:16.966
BY REQUIRING THIS THIRD PARTY TO

02:56:17.033 --> 02:56:19.702
MANAGE SOMEONE ELSE'S LAND.

02:56:19.769 --> 02:56:22.038
AND THEY RETAIN THE LIABILITY

02:56:22.104 --> 02:56:23.739
RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL OF THAT.

02:56:23.806 --> 02:56:25.908
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT A LOW

02:56:25.975 --> 02:56:27.877
INCOME HOUSING AND NON PROFITS

02:56:27.944 --> 02:56:29.845
GENERALLY I KNOW IN THE COUNTY

02:56:29.912 --> 02:56:30.713
OF ORANGE.

02:56:30.780 --> 02:56:31.514
MANAGE THOSE ORIGINALLY

02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:34.350
DEDICATED LOW INCOME UNITS THAT

02:56:34.417 --> 02:56:35.718
THIS IS SOMEBODY'S PRIVATE LAND

02:56:35.785 --> 02:56:38.454
PROVIDING FOR WORKERS THAT YOU

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.156
KNOW MADE ON COMING GOAL

02:56:40.222 --> 02:56:42.058
DEPENDING ON THE SEASON AND THE

02:56:42.124 --> 02:56:43.826
CROPS AND ALL OF THAT.

02:56:43.893 --> 02:56:45.594
A IDEA THAT PERSON IS GOING TO

02:56:45.661 --> 02:56:47.897
BEAR THE LIABILITY FOR ALL OF

02:56:47.964 --> 02:56:49.332
THAT -- AND MAYBE WE VERY

02:56:49.398 --> 02:56:51.033
WILLINGLY IF THEY HAVE THE

02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:53.235
OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY TO

02:56:53.302 --> 02:56:54.737
ENSURE IS BEING MANAGED IN THE

02:56:54.804 --> 02:56:56.806
PROPER WAY AND ALSO MEETING THE

02:56:56.872 --> 02:56:58.541
THE STANDARDS THAT CERTAINLY ARE

02:56:58.607 --> 02:56:59.709
LACKING NOW.

02:56:59.775 --> 02:57:01.610
SO I WOULD THINK IF YOU'RE OPEN

02:57:01.677 --> 02:57:03.145
TO A CONSIDERATION OF AMENDING

02:57:03.212 --> 02:57:04.013
THAT.

02:57:04.080 --> 02:57:05.548
I THINK IT'S GOING IN THE RIGHT

02:57:05.614 --> 02:57:06.682
DIRECTION AND I THINK IT REALLY

02:57:06.749 --> 02:57:09.752
INCENTIVIZE HIS PARTICIPATION.

02:57:09.819 --> 02:57:11.087
BUT WITH THAT PROVISION A VERY

02:57:11.153 --> 02:57:12.688
DIFFICULT THING WE'VE SEEN AND

02:57:12.755 --> 02:57:14.357
NOT WORK WELL -- WITH AFFORDABLE

02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:17.460
HOUSING AND NOW THE COUNTY THAT

02:57:17.526 --> 02:57:18.728
YOU KNOW PUT IT IN WHERE I MANY

02:57:18.794 --> 02:57:20.162
YEARS AGO AND THEY THEY TURNED

02:57:20.229 --> 02:57:21.931
OVER WITHIN A SHORTER PERIOD OF

02:57:21.998 --> 02:57:23.499
TIME BY GETTING SOME LEGISLATION

02:57:23.566 --> 02:57:24.433
THAT ALLOWED THAT.

02:57:24.500 --> 02:57:26.135
SO I'D I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU

02:57:26.202 --> 02:57:28.237
COMMENT ON THAT MAYBE RECONSIDER

02:57:28.304 --> 02:57:29.872
THAT PROVISION NOTHING SURE SO I

02:57:29.939 --> 02:57:31.841
DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND

02:57:31.907 --> 02:57:34.844

BUT IT BUT YOU KNOW THE QUESTION

02:57:36.379 --> 02:57:38.547
OF LIABILITY THAT WAS RAISED BY

02:57:38.614 --> 02:57:39.648
THIS BILL'S OPPONENTS I THINK

02:57:39.715 --> 02:57:41.951
IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- WE'VE

02:57:42.018 --> 02:57:44.387
CONSIDERED IT -- ALREADY YOU

02:57:44.453 --> 02:57:47.123
KNOW AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WHO WILL

02:57:47.189 --> 02:57:48.991
ASSUME THAT LIABILITY AND THEN --

02:57:49.058 --> 02:57:50.226
THE ISSUE OF THE INSURANCE AS

02:57:50.292 --> 02:57:58.901
WELL SO MAYBE THE SPONSOR GOOD --

02:57:58.968 --> 02:58:01.837
MAKE THAT COMMENT.

02:58:01.904 --> 02:58:02.438
YEAH -- THANK YOU [inaudible]

02:58:02.505 --> 02:58:04.240
SO.

02:58:04.306 --> 02:58:05.041
WHEN YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYER?

02:58:05.107 --> 02:58:05.641
HOUSING SOMEONE IT CAN OFTEN

02:58:05.708 --> 02:58:06.275
CREATE PROBLEMS AND THAT'S THE

02:58:06.342 --> 02:58:08.277
PURPOSE OF THIS -- SECOND TIER

02:58:08.344 --> 02:58:13.682
OF MANAGEMENT -- ARE.

02:58:13.749 --> 02:58:18.454
OUR THINKING AND SORRY I LAST

02:58:18.521 --> 02:58:24.827
WINTER BUT IN LATE -- IT SINCE

02:58:24.894 --> 02:58:27.997
IT IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM -- WE

02:58:28.064 --> 02:58:29.432
WANTED TO CREATE A STANDARD THAT

02:58:29.498 --> 02:58:30.933
WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE THE THE

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:32.835
BEST CARE FOR THE TENANTS OF THE

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:34.370
THE THE HOUSING WE ACKNOWLEDGE

02:58:34.437 --> 02:58:35.071
THAT.

02:58:35.137 --> 02:58:36.572
BY CREATING RULES LIKE THIS THE

02:58:36.639 --> 02:58:38.040
NUMBER OF UNITS THAT MIGHT BE

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:40.676
BUILT MAY BE LESS BUT THAT'S WHY

02:58:40.743 --> 02:58:42.078
A PROGRAM LIKE THIS OF PASSING

02:58:42.144 --> 02:58:42.611
THE LAW WILL BE MONITORED

02:58:42.678 --> 02:58:44.780
CLOSELY AND IF CHANGES NEED TO

02:58:44.847 --> 02:58:46.182
BE MADE THEY CAN BE MADE BUT IF.

02:58:46.248 --> 02:58:47.483
IT HOUSING LIKE THIS CAN BE

02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:48.918
DEVELOPED IN HOUSE LIKE THIS IS

02:58:48.984 --> 02:58:50.953
DEVELOPED IT WILL BE THE BEST

02:58:51.020 --> 02:58:52.588
HOUSING FOR FARMWORKER FAMILIES

02:58:52.655 --> 02:58:55.091
AND AND THAT'S WHY THIS THIS --

02:58:55.157 --> 02:58:56.425
PORTION THE BILL IS IN THERE

02:58:56.492 --> 02:58:57.693
WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU NEED TO AN

02:58:57.760 --> 02:58:59.728
INDEMNIFICATION ON COMPONENT OF

02:58:59.795 --> 02:59:00.129
IT.

02:59:00.196 --> 02:59:02.131
I I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE PEOPLE

02:59:02.198 --> 02:59:04.934
HAVING HOUSING ON THE LAND THAT

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.903
THEY OWN IN YONGE THEY HAVE NO

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:09.338
AUTHORITY OVER WHATSOEVER.

02:59:09.405 --> 02:59:11.707
WITHOUT DOUBTS YOU KNOW JUST

02:59:11.774 --> 02:59:13.342
INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME AND YOU

02:59:13.409 --> 02:59:15.044
KNOW THINKING AND ON MY OWN

02:59:15.111 --> 02:59:16.779
PROPERTY IF I PUT IN EIGHTY YOU.

02:59:16.846 --> 02:59:17.446
I WOULD STILL HAVE

02:59:17.513 --> 02:59:19.582
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE

02:59:19.648 --> 02:59:21.350
MAINTENANCE AND JOB.

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:22.384
MAKING SURE THAT WAS MEETING A

02:59:22.451 --> 02:59:23.786
STANDARD THAT IF I GAVE IT OVER

02:59:23.853 --> 02:59:25.354
TO SOMEONE ELSE AND AND THEY GOT

02:59:25.421 --> 02:59:27.923
TO MANAGE MY EIGHTY YOU ON MY

02:59:27.990 --> 02:59:29.291
YOU KNOW BACKYARD DOUBTS THAT

02:59:29.358 --> 02:59:30.326
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL TO

02:59:30.392 --> 02:59:31.660
ME EXCUSE ME BECAUSE I THINK

02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:33.329
IT'S A GREAT PROGRAM.

02:59:33.395 --> 02:59:34.897
BUT I THINK YOU BUILT A POISON

02:59:34.964 --> 02:59:35.798
PILL INTO IT.

02:59:35.865 --> 02:59:40.035
SO THAT I WOULD BE.

02:59:40.102 --> 02:59:41.504
THE BILL DOES NOT.

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:43.806
REQUIRE ANY NEGOTIATION TO

02:59:43.873 --> 02:59:45.374
HAPPEN BETWEEN THE MANAGEMENT --

02:59:45.441 --> 02:59:47.610
NONPROFT AND THE OWNER SO THEY

02:59:47.676 --> 02:59:49.578
CAN STRUCTURE THEIR CONTRACT OF

02:59:49.645 --> 02:59:51.680
HOW THE NONPROFIT MANAGES IT

02:59:51.747 --> 02:59:53.182
INCLUDING WHO HAS LIABILITY FOR

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:54.049
DIFFERENT ISSUES.

02:59:54.116 --> 02:59:55.584
BASED ON NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE

02:59:55.651 --> 02:59:57.753
LANDOWNER AND THE NONPROFIT IF

02:59:57.820 --> 02:59:58.954
THEY DON'T REACH AN AGREEMENT

02:59:59.021 --> 02:59:59.822
THEY CAN CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE

02:59:59.889 --> 03:00:01.590
PROGRAM BUT WE BELIEVE THAT

03:00:01.657 --> 03:00:03.659
THROUGH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE

03:00:03.726 --> 03:00:04.860
NONPROFIT IN A LANDOWNER THEY

03:00:04.927 --> 03:00:05.194
COULD.

03:00:05.261 --> 03:00:06.695
REACH AGREEMENT ON HOW MAY IN

03:00:06.762 --> 03:00:08.130
ITS LIABILITY OTHER ISSUES LIKE

03:00:08.197 --> 03:00:10.099
THAT WOULD BE HANDLED SO WE DO

03:00:10.166 --> 03:00:12.268
THINK THAT.

03:00:12.334 --> 03:00:12.868
THOSE ISSUES CAN BE ADDRESSED

03:00:12.935 --> 03:00:13.569
THROUGH THAT [inaudible]

03:00:13.636 --> 03:00:17.640
NEGOTIATION PROCESS.

03:00:17.706 --> 03:00:20.676
OKAY I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS ARE.

03:00:20.743 --> 03:00:24.513
SO -- SOME MEMBER THANK YOU.

03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:25.648
FOR THE MOTION BY SENATOR ALSO --

03:00:25.714 --> 03:00:27.550

03:00:27.616 --> 03:00:28.918

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:37.326
IMPORTANT.

03:00:37.393 --> 03:00:37.927
I MEAN WE HAVE TO BACK UP AND

03:00:37.993 --> 03:00:38.661
LOOK AT WHY THIS IS NECESSARY

03:00:38.727 --> 03:00:41.063

BIG STREAMLINING BILL A COUPLE

03:00:43.399 --> 03:00:44.767
YEARS AGO AND I I THINK IT'S

03:00:44.833 --> 03:00:47.670
IMPORTANT FOR US -- TO TO MOVE

03:00:47.736 --> 03:00:50.206
TO EXPEDITE HOUSING APPROVALS

03:00:50.272 --> 03:00:53.776

03:00:53.842 --> 03:00:56.312
TO REMOVE SOME OF THE LOCAL

03:00:56.378 --> 03:00:58.180
OBSTRUCTION TO HOUSING AND WE

03:00:58.247 --> 03:01:00.449

LAND TO BAN APARTMENT BUILDINGS

03:01:06.722 --> 03:01:08.157
WE MAKE A REALLY HARD TO BUILD

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:08.991
ANYTHING.

03:01:09.058 --> 03:01:10.326
AND THEN PEOPLE WONDER WHY

03:01:10.392 --> 03:01:11.827

03:01:11.894 --> 03:01:14.396

03:01:14.463 --> 03:01:15.998
SOMETIMES DON'T CONNECTED TO AND

03:01:16.065 --> 03:01:16.599
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE DO

03:01:16.665 --> 03:01:18.067
THAT AND IN OUR CULTURAL

03:01:18.133 --> 03:01:20.970
COMMUNITIES -- WE HAVE -- AND

03:01:21.036 --> 03:01:23.305
IT'S VERY HARD TO GET APPROVAL

03:01:23.372 --> 03:01:24.673
TO BUILD FARMWORKERS HOUSING AND

03:01:24.740 --> 03:01:29.445
YOU WONDER WONDER WHY

FARMWORKERS ARE LIVING IN SUCH.

03:01:30.946 --> 03:01:33.315
DEPLORABLE -- CONDITIONS -- AND

03:01:33.382 --> 03:01:34.216
FARMWORKERS ARE FUELING THESE

03:01:34.283 --> 03:01:36.051
LOCAL ECONOMIES HELPING FUEL THE

03:01:36.118 --> 03:01:37.119
ECONOMY OF STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:37.720
AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE IT

03:01:37.786 --> 03:01:39.021
EASIER.

03:01:39.088 --> 03:01:40.122
I'M FASTER OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO

03:01:40.189 --> 03:01:43.192
BUILD -- THIS HOUSING -- IN

03:01:43.259 --> 03:01:44.693
TERMS OF THE AGE TO A ISSUE AND

03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:46.862
I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO AND

03:01:46.929 --> 03:01:48.197
ANOTHER BILL.

03:01:48.264 --> 03:01:51.000
TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ENSURE THAT

EACH WAY WORKERS WHO ARE HERE

03:01:52.067 --> 03:01:53.068
CAN BE HOUSE.

03:01:53.135 --> 03:01:55.571
BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT PROJECTS

03:01:55.638 --> 03:01:56.872
AS A CENTER THERE ALSO SET A

03:01:56.939 --> 03:02:00.643
RECEIVING A PUBLIC FUNDS -- AND

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:02.378
ONE PUBLIC FUNDS OR ISSUE -- I

03:02:02.444 --> 03:02:03.379
THINK IT IS PERFECTLY

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:06.048
APPROPRIATE TO FOCUS THOSE FUNDS --

03:02:06.115 --> 03:02:10.119
ON HOUSING -- FOR FAMILIES YOU

03:02:10.185 --> 03:02:11.387

03:02:29.972 --> 03:02:30.973
AND UP INTEGRATING INTO OUR

03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:31.874
COMMUNITY AND THAT'S A GOOD

03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:33.275
THING -- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:02:33.342 --> 03:02:34.510
PUBLIC FUNDS I THINK IT'S

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:36.745
PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE AND I

03:02:36.812 --> 03:02:38.447
THINK IT'S A GOOD THING -- TO

03:02:38.514 --> 03:02:41.317
FOCUS A ON THESE FAMILIES -- SO

03:02:41.383 --> 03:02:43.218
I I SUPPORT THAT ASPECT OF THE

03:02:43.285 --> 03:02:46.255
BILL -- AS WELL -- I ALSO SAW A

03:02:46.322 --> 03:02:48.691

03:02:48.757 --> 03:02:50.793
MANAGING THE PROPERTIES AND I OF

03:02:50.859 --> 03:02:52.828
COURSE RUN -- AN ILL FATED A

03:02:52.895 --> 03:02:53.862
FORMER FOR HOUSING BILL LAST

03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:55.531
YEAR ON I LEARNED A LOT DURING

03:02:55.597 --> 03:02:57.266
THE PROCESS AND I'M GLAD THIS

03:02:57.333 --> 03:03:00.703
BILL IS MOVING FORWARD -- IN A

03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:03.372
STRONG WAY -- BUT THE IDEA OF

03:03:03.439 --> 03:03:04.573
HAVING SOMEONE BE BOTH YOUR

03:03:04.640 --> 03:03:07.543
LANDLORD AND YOUR BOSS IS IS

03:03:07.609 --> 03:03:10.879
PROBLEMATIC -- IN A LOT OF WAYS --

03:03:10.946 --> 03:03:13.282
AND HAVING A THIRD PARTY AND WE

03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:16.852
HAVE MANY VERY REPUTABLE --

03:03:16.919 --> 03:03:19.021
NONPROFIT -- AFFORDABLE HOUSING

03:03:19.088 --> 03:03:20.923
ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN VERY

PUBLIC FUNDS ARE BEING USED HERE

03:03:28.597 --> 03:03:30.299
SO I DON'T THINK IT IS

03:03:30.366 --> 03:03:32.267
OUTRAGEOUS -- TO SAY THAT IT

03:03:32.334 --> 03:03:35.204

03:03:35.270 --> 03:03:36.372

CAN BE STRUCTURED AND NEGOTIATED --

03:03:39.475 --> 03:03:42.010
SO THIS IS A GOOD BILL -- I

03:03:42.077 --> 03:03:43.345
SUPPORTED -- I AM RECOMMENDING

03:03:43.412 --> 03:03:49.118

AND FINALLY ON THE H. TO A ISSUE

03:03:52.321 --> 03:03:53.489

03:03:53.555 --> 03:03:55.224
