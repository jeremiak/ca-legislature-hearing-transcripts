CHAIRS LOW WOODEN CABALLERO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING TODAY AND ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. MY NAME IS BEN GLICKMAN I'M A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE GOVERNMENT LAW SECTION WHERE I CHAIR A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WORKING GROUP. THAT HAS REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENTS VARIOUS SECTIONS THAT HANDLE CANNABIS RELATED MATTERS I ALSO WORK WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES. OTHER STATES AND VARIOUS OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO COORDINATE CANNABIS MATTERS FOR THE DEPARTMENT. WITH ME TODAY IS MELANIE FONT HAS RAINER SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SPECIAL AGENT IN CHARGE LOUIS LOPEZ WHO EN MASSE TO. COME UP HERE FOR CERTAIN QUESTIONS I I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER. AS THE COMMITTEES ARE AWARE OUR OFFICE PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION AT THE STATE LEVEL. FIRST THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SERVICES THE STATE'S CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. THROUGH THIS ROLE IN AS RESOURCES PERMIT. WE ANTICIPATE WORKING CLOSELY WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW. AND TO POLICE THAT LEGAL MARKET. FURTHER THROUGH OUR CLIENT REPRESENTATION WE ARE WORKING WITH THE THREE LICENSING AGENCIES. TO HELP ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING CANNABIS ARE ENFORCED. FINALLY IN LIGHT OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE CALIFORNIA'S FOR FEDERAL PROSECUTORS. IN ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF ATTORNEYS GENERALS AND OTHER STATES THAT CURRENTLY REGULATE CANNABIS. INCREASED RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WOULD SUPPLEMENT AND STRENGTHEN THESE IMPORTANT EFFORTS. I AS THE COMMITTEES ARE AWARE SENATE BILL NINETY FOUR CREATED A UNIFIED LICENSING SCHEME FOR BOTH RECREATIONAL AND MEDICINAL CANNABIS. AND LICENSE THINGS ARE LICENSES ARE CURRENTLY ISSUED BY THREE STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE HERE TODAY. ALL LET THEM SPEAK ABOUT THEIR RESPECTIVE ROLES. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S PRIMARY ROLE IS REALLY TWO FOLD. AS MENTIONED ONE OF OUR MAIN ROLES IS WORKING WITH THE LICENSING AGENCIES IN REPRESENTATION AS MATTERS ARISE IN PARTICULAR WE ANTICIPATE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN LICENSING RELATED DISPUTES. AND TO SUPPORT THAT INCREASED WORKLOAD WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A NEW CANNABIS CONTROL SECTION AT THE DEPARTMENT. WHICH WILL PROVIDE CONSISTENT AND COORDINATED REPRESENTATION OF THE LICENSING AGENCIES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. IN ADDITION WE ANTICIPATE THAT AS THE CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY OF THE STATE WE ANTICIPATE INCREASED WORKLOAD RELATED TO POLICING THE ILLEGAL MARKET. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BELIEVES THAT VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S LAWS AGAINST ILLEGAL CANNABIS ACTIVITY IS THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE A STRONG REGULATED CANNABIS MARKET. TO THAT END OUR OFFICE IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO COORDINATE AND SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE. AGAIN ONE WAY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT THESE IMPORTANT EFFORTS HISSED THROUGH INCREASED RESOURCES FOR THE DEPARTMENT. THE COMMITTEES ASKED THE DEPARTMENT TO SPEAK IN PARTICULAR ABOUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AS SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAD HAD OPERATED PURSUANT TO THE COAL MEMORANDUM. THIS MEMORANDUM GENERALLY ADVISED UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS NOT TO PROSECUTE INDIVIDUALS OR BUSINESSES THAT WERE ACTING IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE CANNABIS LAWS. PROVIDED THAT THEIR ACTIVITIES DID NOT RUN AFOUL OF OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES. NOT WITHSTANDING THE SKIES HOWEVER CANNABIS ALWAYS REMAINED ILLEGAL UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ALWAYS RETAIN DISCRETION TO PROSECUTE CANNABIS CRIMES. HOWEVER CONSISTENT WITH THE IT IT LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITY SET FORTH IN THE COAL MEMO. US ATTORNEYS NATIONWIDE HAD GENERALLY FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON MAJOR CRIMES AND OTHER FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES SUCH AS CARTEL ACTIVITY. ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES ILLEGAL GROWS ON FEDERAL LANDS. IN ADDITION SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CONGRESS HAS PROTECTED STATES RIGHTS TO OVERSEE MEDICINAL CANNABIS. THROUGH THE ROHRBACHER FAR AND ROHRBACHER BLUMENAUER APPROPRIATIONS AMENDMENT. THESE AMENDMENTS PREVENT THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FROM USING FEDERAL MONEY. TO PREVENT STATES FROM IMPLEMENTING MEDICINAL MARIJUANA PROGRAMS. HOWEVER AS THE COMMITTEES ARE AWARE IN EARLY JANUARY ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS RESCINDED THE CALL MEMORANDUM AND RELATED GUIDANCE. IN ITS PLACE ATTORNEY JUST GENERAL SESSIONS DIRECTED US ATTORNEYS TO EXERCISE THEIR PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION FOR CANNABIS CRIMES CONSISTENT WITH LONG STANDING GENERAL GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES THESE PROSECUTORS TO WEIGH ALL RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS. IN DETERMINING LAW ENFORCEMENT PRIORITIES AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS ACTIONS HOWEVER DID NOT ALTER THE ENFORCEMENT LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE ROHRBACHER BLUMENAUER AMENDMENTS. CONGRESS MOST RECENTLY EXTENDED THAT PROHIBITION THROUGH MARCH TWENTY THIRD IN THE LATEST CONTINUING RESOLUTION. THE IMPACT IF ANY OF ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS RECENT ACTIONS WILL TURN ON THE DECISIONS OF THE STATE'S FOR UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CALL MEMOS RECESSION ATTORNEY GENERAL SERWIS REACHED OUT TO ALL FOUR US ATTORNEYS TO DISCUSS. CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT IN CALIFORNIA. THE US ATTORNEY'S AT EACH AGREED TO A MEETING AND WE HOPE THAT THIS MEETING WILL BE SCHEDULED IN THE COMING WEEKS. OUR GOALS IN THAT MEETING ARE THREEFOLD. FIRST TO EDUCATE THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST REGULATORY SCHEME. SECOND TO URGE THEM TO CONTINUE THEIR LONGSTANDING PRACTICES OF PRIORITIZING ILLEGAL DRUG ACTIVITY CARTEL ACTIVITY ILLEGAL GROWS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES. AND FINALLY. TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES FOR COOPERATION IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR EXAMPLE POLICING INTERSTATE EXPORTS MONITORING ILLEGAL CROWS PUBLIC AND LANDS CRIMES IN CARTEL ACTIVITY. LASTLY THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ATTORNEYS GENERALS CANNABIS WORKGROUP. THIS WORK GROUP IS A BIT IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND HAS TAKEN AN INCREASED ROLE WAS MORE AND MORE STATES HAVE ENTERED THE REGULATED CANNABIS MARKET. THE GROUP FOCUSES ON FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES AND PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA AND OTHER STATES REGULATING CANNABIS. FOR EXAMPLE LAST MONTH ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SARAH AND EIGHTEEN OTHER ATTORNEYS GENERALS SENT A LETTER TO CONGRESS URGING ACTION TO BRING CANNABIS RELATED COMMERCE INTO THE BANKING SYSTEM. A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE STATE. IN CONCLUSION THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS CLOSELY MONITORING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S REGULATED CANNABIS MARKETS AS WELL AS LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OTHER STATES WITH A SHARED INTEREST IN PREVENTING FEDERAL DISRUPTION OF STATE LAW IN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS EXAMINING HOW BEST TO WORK WITH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LAW. HOWEVER THERE'S NO WAY AROUND IT SUCCESSFULLY COMBATING THE STATE'S ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKETS CANNOT HAPPEN WITH THIS SIGNIFICANT WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE STAND READY TO DEFEND THE LOS OF OUR STATE AND ITS CITIZENS AGAINST ANY AND ALL THREATS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ASSEMBLY. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LOW CHAIR CAFE HERE OWN CHAIR WOULD AND. COMMITTEE MEMBERS APPRECIATE BEING INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. THE CALIFORNIA AVERAGE JOE DOES NOT HAVE A SPITZ SPECIFIC REGULATORY ROLE RELATING TO CANNABIS. RECREATIONAL USE AND THE NEW REGULATORY SYSTEM IS ALREADY HAVING AN IMPACT. ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THAT'LL CONTINUE TO EXPAND AS THE INDUSTRY GROWS. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE IMPACTS WILL BE UNIQUE. TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THERE ARE SOME VERY CRUCIAL CHALLENGES. THAT WILL BE FELT DIRECTLY BY THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. ENFORCING OUR CANNABIS LAWS ON CALIFORNIA ROADWAYS AND COMBATING AN INCREASE. IN IMPAIR DRIVING AS OTHER STATES HAVE EXPERIENCE AFTER RECREATIONAL LEGALIZATION. AS A DEPARTMENT THAT MAKES OVER TWO MILLION ENFORCEMENT CONTACTS EACH YEAR WE ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF FACING THESE CHALLENGES. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THERE'S STATE AGENCY PARTNERS HERE AT THIS TABLE TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND THE NEW LICENSING STRUCTURE. THIS UNDERSTANDING IS CRUCIAL SO WE CAN SHARE OUR OFFICERS TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION WHEN THEY ENCOUNTERED CANNABIS ON OUR HIGHWAYS. IN FACT WE RECENTLY DISTRIBUTED SEVERAL EDUCATIONAL BULLETINS TO OUR FIELD PERSONNEL ABOUT THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE. WE HAVE ALSO PROVIDED REGULAR INPUT TO THE TO THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL ANOTHER STATE. REGULATORS ABOUT INFORMATION LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL NEED TO VERIFY THAT CANNABIS THE ENCOUNTERS BEING TRANSPORTED LEGALLY. THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL HAS AN ONLINE PORTAL. THAT WE CAN EXPECT SAYS AND RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A DEDICATED TWENTY FOUR HOUR HOTLINE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO USE TO VERIFY. LICENSE AND MANIFEST INFORMATION. THE CHALLENGE WE EXPECT AT IN THE NEW REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT WILL BE DETERMINING WHEN A LICENSING VIOLATION CROSSES THE LINE INTO UNLAWFUL POSSESSION. AND ALSO DISTRIBUTION. THIS IS UNIQUE CHALLENGE. FOR THE CHP BECAUSE WE OPERATE IN ALL FIFTY COUNTIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DIRECTED OUR HUNDRED AND THREE AREA COMMANDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO MEET WITH THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT ISSUE WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING IS OUR INVOLVEMENT IN COMBATING BLACK MARKET CANNABIS. BOTH LOCALLY AND AS TRANSPORTED ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARIES ON THE ROADWAYS. RICK WE RECOGNIZE THAT CALIFORNIA LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO FUNCTION IN FLOURISH IS IMPORTANT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT FOCUS ON LEGAL OPERATORS. WE ARE ALWAYS READY TO ASSIST OUR LOCAL AND STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS TO CRACKDOWN ON ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TAKE A FOURSOME ACTION AGAINST ILLEGAL OPERATORS WE ENCOUNTER DIRECTLY ON THE ROAD WITH HIS. AND IT THIS TIME I TURN IT OVER TO YOUR AND MY LEGISLATIVE LIAISON ASSISTANT CHIEF RICH DESMOND. AND HILL DISCUSS IMPAIR DRIVING. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU OFFER MAKING ROOM FOR ME AT THE TABLE UNCERTAIN WHAT I THINK YOU'RE HERE COMMITTEE STAFF. THEY'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO US AS WE PREPARE FOR THE TESTIMONY TODAY. I'VE I'VE COME TO THE COMMITTEE BEFORE A TEST FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE IMPAIR DRIVING CHALLENGES THAT THEY WERE FACING THE CHP. AND AS YOU AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY PERSONAL TO OUR AGENCY WE ACTUALLY JUST LOST AN OFFICER ON CHRISTMAS EVE AS A RESULT OF OF SOMEONE WHO IS IMPAIRED. I ON THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS COMBINED. SO IT'S AN ISSUE WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY THE TRAFFIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE AND CERTAINLY PERSONALLY BECAUSE THE LOSS OF OF OUR FELLOW OFFICERS WE EXPERIENCED. AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH MANY OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THE DO YOU AIDID CHALLENGES AND I USED TO. THE ACRONYM DO YOU ID DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS CHALLENGES WITH CANNABIS. CANNABIS IS IS IS NOT LIKE ALCOHOL IT. IS NOT ABSORBED AND IT DOESN'T DISSIPATE IN YOUR BODY THE SAME WAY ALCOHOL DOES. THAT'S INHERENT CHALLENGE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WORD WE DETERMINE WHERE IMPAIRMENT IS AND TRY TO CORRELATE THAT WITH SOME KIND LEVEL WITH CANNABIS. I GET ASKED FREE FREQUENTLY ABOUT. WELL WHY DOESN'T THE CHP SUPPORT SOME KIND OF THRESHOLD LEVEL FOR CANNABIS LIKE WE DO WITH ALCOHOL WE OF THE. WAIT BA SEE STANDARD FOR ALCOHOL THE TRUTH IS CANNABIS IT DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU'RE A A. INFREQUENT USER A CHRONIC USER YOU MAY HAVE VARYING LEVELS IN YOUR SYSTEM OF THE ADULT IN NINETY EIGHT SEE THAT'S THE IN IMPAIRING FEATURE OF CANNABIS. YOU MAY HAVE VARYING LEVELS AND THERE'S NO PLACE THAT WE CAN PINPOINT IT CORRELATE WITH IMPAIRMENT IF THAT MAKES SENSE. YOU THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING WHEN I HAVE THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT A A THRESHOLD LEVEL FOR. CANNABIS IMPAIRMENT IS THAT ON THE ONE SIDE THE THE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT COMMUNITY. IS VERY CONCERNED THAT ANY THRESHOLD LEVEL MIGHT BE TOO HIGH IN OTHER WORDS. IF IF IF A FIVE NANOGRAM LEVEL FERENC. FOR INSTANCE IS ESTABLISHED THERE MAY BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IMPAIRED WELL BELOW THAT LEVEL. ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT OF SCIENTIFIC. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. IF YOU ESTABLISH FIVE NANOGRAMS SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED UNTIL WELL ABOVE THAT THAT THAT AMOUNT AND AGAIN THAT IS ALL BECAUSE OF THE. COMPLEXITY OF THIS OF THIS. OF CANNABIS AND THE INABILITY TO CORRELATED TO ALCOHOL CENTER BIG CHALLENGE ON THE DO YOU ID FRONT FOR US. ANOTHER BIG CHALLENGE IS. IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO MEASURE MARIJUANA SO I. I PULL SOMEONE OVER AND I SUSPECT HIM OF BEING UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND MAYBE THEY HAVE THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE CONSUMED. CANNABIS RECENTLY. THE IMPAIRING ASPECTS OF CANNABIS THAT DELTA NINETY EIGHT C. LEAVES YOUR SYSTEM VERY QUICKLY SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TO MEASURE THAT IMPAIRING LEVEL CANNABIS. I CHALLENGE AT SOMEWHAT RELATED TO THAT IS THAT WE DON'T IN LAW FOR SOME WE DON'T HAVE A DEVICE. IN THE FIELD FOR OFFICERS TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE. CANNABIS LEVELS IN YOUR SYSTEM MUCH LIKE WHAT RIGHT NOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN THESE THESE PAST WE CALL THEM HOUSE DEVICES THEIR PRELIMINARY ALCOHOL SCREENING DEVICES THAT THAT WE CAN USE AS A FIELD SOBRIETY TESTS IN THE FIELD. THERE IS NO. SIMILAR DEVICE TO MEASURE RECENT. CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS THAT THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND YOU COMBINE THESE WITH AN INDUSTRY THAT IS CERTAINLY GONNA BE MARKETING CANNABIS DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT WAYS SHAPES AND FORMS AND DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES BECOME I THINK. EVEN EVEN HARDER TO HANDLE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR I'VE HAD SOME SPECIFIC PROVISIONS TO GET OUT THIS IMPAIR DRIVING ISSUE. ALLOCATES THREE MILLION ANNUALLY TO THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL TO. STUDY BEST PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS FOR BOTH DETECTING AND APPREHENDING IN PROSECUTING IMPAIRED DRIVERS. THAT THAT MONEY WILL START KICKING IN IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND WERE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW DEVELOPING A PLAN ON WHERE TO SPEND THAT MONEY. IN EXISTING RESEARCH EFFORT THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO IS ACTUALLY DOING A STUDY RIGHT NOW TO DETERMINE. WHAT IS THE BEST WAY FOR AN OFFICER ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD TO DETECT WHETHER SOMEONE IS IMPAIRED ON OF THE INFLUENCE OF CANNABIS AND DRUGS? BECAUSE FOR FOR MANY MANY YEARS THE FOCUS FOR DOZEN OFFICER LIKE ME WAS NOT SPECIALLY TRAINED AS A DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERT. TO FOCUS ON ALCOHOL WHEN YOU DO A BETTER JOB IN DETECTING A DRUG PARA. ANOTHER ASPECT OF OF. PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR IS IT ALLOCATES A PORTION OF THE TAX REVENUE. FOR DO YOU AYE RELATED TRAINING. EDUCATION AND ENFORCEMENT NOT JUST FOR THE HIGHWAY PATROL'S BUT. IN THE FORM OF GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. AND AND THAT'S GOOD THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THAT THAT MONEY WILL NOT KICK IN I BELIEVE UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. AT THE HIGHWAY PATROL WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR THESE THE FUNDING EFFORTS TO KICK IN AS A LOT THINGS WERE DOING NET RIGHT NOW SOMEONE A RELAY THAT YOU VERY QUICKLY. WE'VE RESTRUCTURED INTERNALLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT AND WE'VE CREATED AND WE'VE DEDICATED DISH NOBODY'S INTERNALLY FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING SECTIONS WE CAN PLACE APPROPRIATE EMPHASIS ON THIS NEW ISSUE. AND ON THE ADMINISTRATION OF THESE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A. A NEW WAY TO CAPTURE BETTER DATA FROM FROM. COLLISIONS FOR IMPAIRED DRIVING. RIGHT NOW THERE THERE IS NO CONSISTENT WAY THAT LAW OFFERS NAY SHE'S REPORT DATA RELATED TO IMPAIR DRIVING SO INTERNALLY TO SEE IF YOU WERE CHANGES AND THINGS TO DO A BETTER JOB INTERNALLY. AS THE STATE WIDE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERTS. COORDINATOR WE TRAIN A MAJORITY OF THE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERTS IN THE STATE AND THAT IS THAT THE GOLD STANDARD RIGHT NOW FOR FOR IDENTIFYING IN CANNABIS IMPAIRED DRIVERS OR DRUG IMPAIRED DRIVERS. LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR BROWN APPROVED A PROVISION IN S. B. NINETY FOUR TO ALLOCATE THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CHP TO TRY TO GET MORE DRUG RECOGNITION EXPERTS INTO THE SYSTEM. THE GOOD NEWS IS SINCE THAT FUNDING HAS HAS STARTED WE'VE TRAINED TO HUNT A PRICE WE TUNER TWENTY THREE MORE. DODD DRUG RECOGNITION RECOGNITION EXPERTS IN THE STATE WHICH IS GOOD WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A PANACEA WHEN IT COMES TO IMPAIR DRIVING BUT IT IS IS CERTAINLY IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE ARE TRAINING ALL OF OUR UNIFORMED FIELD OFFICERS AND SERGEANTS TO BE OUT TO GET ADVANCE ROADSIDE IMPAIRED DRIVER ENFORCEMENT. THAT'S ONE STEP ABOVE WHAT. OFFICERS RECEIVING THE ACADEMY. AND WE OF COURSE PARTICIPATE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS NOT ONLY AT O. T. S. IN THERE BLUEPRINT. PROJECT BUT ALSO THE STRATEGIC HIGHWAY SAFETY PLAN IMPAIRED DRIVING CHALLENGE AREA AM AND TO MISTER STANLEY ALSO CHAIRS AREA A TASK FORCE THAT WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. AND. THE IDEA OF THE TASK FORCE IS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES WERE DO YOU IDEA EDUCATION DETECTION APPREHENSION PROSECUTION. THE GOOD THING ABOUT THAT TASK FORCES INCLUDES A DIVERSE GROUP OF REPRESENT IS NOT ONLY FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT PROSECUTORS CRIME LABS BUT ALSO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. SCROTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AND ALSO REGULATORY STAKEHOLDERS. THE SECOND MEETING IS ACTUALLY YA NEXT WEEK FOR THAT TASK FORCE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN IN CALIFORNIA'S A MINUTES IT'S REALLY TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE BUT WE CAN LOOK AT COLORADO WASHINGTON? A COLORADO. SINCE LEGAL IS A HERB AND A BIT FROM. TWENTY THIRTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS INVOLVED IN FATAL CRASHES TESTING POSITIVE FOR MARIJUANA ROSE BY EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT. NOW THAT DOESN'T DEFINITIVELY SAY HOW MANY THOSE DRIVERS WERE IMPAIRED BY CANNABIS BUT IT SAYS A LOT MORE PEOPLE WERE GETTING KILLED ON THE ROADWAYS IN COLORADO HAD CANNABIS IN THEIR SYSTEM MAYOR ONE IN THEIR SYSTEM. IN WASHINGTON THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL TRAFFIC FATALITIES INVOLVING A MARIJUANA IMPAIRED DRIVER HAS NEARLY DOUBLED. FROM THE THREE YEARS PRECEDING LEGALIZATION THROUGH TWENTY SIXTEEN SO WE ANTICIPATE THE SAME AFFECTING CALIFORNIA. AND. AND AND I THINK PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR PROVIDES US WITH A LOT OF TOOLS WERE DOING A LOT OF THINGS IN THE INNER. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INVITING US HERE TODAY AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR OR WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE. PANEL PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MUCH FEEL. THANK YOU. YOUR LOVE DOCTOR WOULD.

A DURING PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE THREE PANEL DISCUSSIONS AGAIN PUBLIC COMMENT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE A FINALLY THIRD PANEL. SO AT THIS POINT ANY QUESTIONS AT. FOR OUR PANELISTS SUMMER LACKEY. YES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND I JUST WANTED TO. BEGIN BY THANKING YOU MISS AJAX FOR ALL YOUR TIRELESS WORK. AND TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THIS REGULATORY SYSTEM. I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO PUT THAT TOGETHER ALL THESE MOVING PARTS AND. THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HOURS YOU'VE BEEN PUTTING AND. AND ALSO CONGRATULATE. MISTER WARD STANLEY FOR DEPLOYMENT TO THE CHP HAS ITS COMMISSIONER. AND THIS QUESTION WOULD BE DIRECTED TOWARDS OF MISS AJAX OF THEM ARE YOU HEARING FROM LICENSEES ABOUT THE NEED. FOR FORSMAN AGAINST LEGAL OPERATORS. JUDGING BY THE COMMENTS SUBMITTED TO THE CANNABIS ADVISORY SUBCOMMITTEE ON ENFORCEMENT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A GROWING PROBLEM. YEAH WE WE ARE GETTING SO WE HAVE ONLINE YOU CAN FILE A COMPLAINT WITH US OR YOU CAN. PHONE US AND WE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF OUR LICENSEES HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER COMPETING WITH. OF THE UNLICENSED MARKET OUT THERE SO THAT IS THE. HAS BEEN PROBABLY ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONCERNS THAT WE'RE HEARING EVEN ON THE FIELD AS OUR INSPECTORS GO OUT. KID THANK YOU THE GENERAL BUDGET RELEASES PROPOSED DELAYING SEVERAL SOURCES OF FUNDING UNTIL THE NINETEEN TWENTY FISCAL YEAR. WHAT KIND OF ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC LANDS AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT RELEASING PROP SIXTYFORCE FUNDING? FOR THIS. ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION PROTECTION ACCOUNT. SO I'M I'M JUST CAN YOU TELL ME YOU AT WHAT SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE ASKING. I'M. YEAH BUT WHAT I'M WHAT I'M ASKING FOR IS SO WHAT KIND OF FORSMAN. CAN WE DO ON PUBLIC LANDS OF THIS WAS ACTUALLY. THE CASE IF WE DELAY THAT FUNDING RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU WE'VE BEEN REALLY FOCUSED ON ONE LICENSING AND THEN ONE GETTING OUT THERE AND EDUCATING PEOPLE TO GET LICENSE. I THINK THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS WE WOULD BE HAVING WITH OUR. WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IN CH P. TO SEE WHILE WHERE WE CAN DO ENFORCEMENT ON PUBLIC LANDS. BUT THAT IS PART OF A GREATER UNDERSTANDING WITH THE BUREAU AND OUR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT POP UP PARTNERS WITH THE STATE. OKAY. JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS IF THAT'S OKAY. RICHER. IN THIS QUESTION WOULD BE THAT TO EITHERTHE COMMISSIONER CHIEF DESMOND. WHAT IS A SIEGE PIECING ON HIGHWAYS AS FAR AS LICENSE DISTRIBUTORS? AND A WHAT KINDS OF ILLEGAL TRANSPORT IS IT SEEN. OUR EARTH THEY EVEN HAVE ANY INDICATION. DESPERATE THANK YOU. THAT JUST RECENTLY WE HAD A. ENFORCEMENT STOP THAT WAS MADE FOR A DUI UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NINE FIVE BY ONE OR OFFICERS IN. HE CAME INTO CONTACT THE GERMANY STOPPED IN FOR. POSSIBLY DRIVING OF INFLUENCE. AND IT TURNED OUT HE WAS DRIVING ON THE INFLUENCE OF OF CANNABIS. ANNE AT APPROXIMATELY SIXTY POUNDS OF MARIJUANA WITHIN. HE HAD LIMITED INFORMATION REGARDING. YOU KNOW LOCATION WORKING FROM AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND THE OFFICER CALLED IS STARTING OUT. TO SYSTEM THEY MADE SOME CALLS. ANSWERS TO BCC WEBSITE THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND. I ANY INFORMATION. AT THAT TIME. SO WHAT THEY DID THEY ARRESTED HIM FOR DE WHY. ANY THIS BOOK THE COUNTY JAIL NORTH. AND THEN THE FOLLOWING DAY THE SERGEANT DID SOME MORE. RESEARCH ON THE BCC WEBSITE HE WAS ABLE TO FIND THE GERMANS LICENSE AND AFTER THE GENTLEMAN WAS RELEASED. FOR BEING ARRESTED FOR DUI. YEAH HE WAS ABLE TO PICK UP THIS MARIJUANA AND MOVE ON S.. AT SIR. YOU NO PROCEED ON OKAY. THAT WAS JUST SO FAR THAT'S THE THE ONLY INCIDENT. THAT WE'VE BEEN MADE AWARE WHERE. THE OFFICER HAS SOME TROUBLE TRYING TO. I LOCATE THE. PERSON'S LICENSE. BECAUSE OF I COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THAT WHAT WHAT ACTIONS CAN THE CHP OFFICER TAKE OF THE ENCOUNTER LICENSE DISTRIBUTOR. WHO IS A VIOLATION OF STATE REGULATIONS ARE LOST TO DO WE HAVE A MECHANISM IN? IN PLACE TO. RECOGNIZE THAT AND TO TAKE FOLLOW BACK WHAT BIG THEY CAN'T FOLLOW UP A THE BUREAU OF CANADA'S CONTROL THE RECENT RELEASED. A TELEPHONE NUMBER AND I FOR A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR. IN EMAIL ADDRESS THAT. IF THEY COME ACROSS SOMEONE IN THAT YOU'RE ABOUT THE LICENSE THEY CAN CALL THAT NUMBER OR SEND EMAIL TO THAT EMAIL ADDRESS AND GET SOME INFORMATION BACK. THE TRY TO DETERMINE THAT THE PERSONS ARE LICENSED PRODUCTS BALLOT OR NOT. OKAY. AND MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE FOR A MISTER PARENT. OF WHAT'S THE STATUS ATTRACTED TRACE. BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE DOJ CLUTCH SYSTEM. SO WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING ON THAT PROJECT WERE IN MEETINGS WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DOJ. AND IT'S IT'S. IT'S BEING WORKED ON RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT AND IT'S AYE I DON'T HAVE IT AN EXACT TIME LINE BUT IF IT IS IN. SUBJECT OF ONGOING REGULAR MEETINGS WITH DOJ CDFA. AND COME. DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY. OKAY THANK YOU MIGHT MY FINAL COMMENT MISTER CHAIR AND TO THOSE LISTENING. IS THAT YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE IN THE FORSMAN ARENA. AND WERE IN FEBRUARY ALREADY. AND. THE LONGER WE TAKE TO COORDINATE JUSTICE OF FORSMAN EFFORT. OF THE BIGGER DISADVANTAGE OF THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO PLAY BY RULES WILL HAVE AND THE LESS. LIKELIHOOD THEY ARE TO WANT TO PLAY BY THE RULES AND SO I'M HOPING THAT WE AS A BODY CAN. DO THE THINGS NECESSARY TO PUT IN PLACE MAYBE A COORDINATED EFFORT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND COMMUNICATE MORE CLEARLY WITH THE LOCAL AND STATE OFFICIALS AS TO WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT. THEY CAN NOW HAVE A CHANCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER LACKEY. CHAIRMAN COMING UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL FIRST LET ME THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS AYE APPRECIATE GETTING THE AND UPDATED INFORMATION. I'M I'M HAPPY TO HEAR THAT. LETTERS ARE GOING OUT TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NOT LICENSED IT WAS ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT I HEARD. I HAVE HEARD REPEATEDLY AND COORDINATION WITH LOCAL ON FORSMAN IS GOING TO BE REALLY CRITICAL SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT. I HAVE A QUESTION I HAVE A COUPLEOF QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE IS. TO CDFA Y. DON'T TEMPORARY LICENSEES HAVE TO RIVER REPORT INTO TRACK AND TRACE. AND WITH NO TRACK ENTRY SOMEPLACE INTO PERMANENT LICENSING HOW IS ENFORCEMENT GOING TO BE DONE. AND HOW MUCH LATITUDE WILL BUT THE POLICE HAVE TO HAVE PRODUCTS EAST. OKAY I'LL ANSWER THAT SOME. SO WITH REGARD TO TRACK AND TRACE INTEMPERATE LICENSEES LIKE TO PROVIDE YOU SOME BACKGROUND ON HOW WE GOT TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY. SEVERAL FACTORS HAD TO BE CONSIDERED BY ALL LICENSING AUTHORITIES PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS SO THIS IS AS WE ARE WORKING ON THE REGULATIONS. LAST SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER. USERS OF THE. USERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM NEED TO BE TRAINED PARTY USING THE SYSTEM. TRAINING WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE COMPLETED PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THE ABILITY FOR CELLS OUR PRODUCT TO COMMENCE AS OF JANUARY FIRST WHICH WAS. WHAT WE BELIEVED Y. TEMPORARY LICENSES WERE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STATUTE WAS TO ALLOW THE EXISTING BUSINESSES TO? CONTINUE ON THE. TEMPORARY LICENSE PROCESS IS A VERY STREAMLINED PROCESS. HAD TEMPORARY LICENSE HE'S BEEN REQUIRED TO USE THE THAT TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM LICENSING AUTHORITIES WOULD HAVE HAD TO WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHARGED FEES FOR TEMPORARY LICENSES. BY THEN ALL OF THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES HAD. COLLECTIVELY DECIDED THAT TEMPORARY LICENSES WOULD HAVE NO FEES THE THE SYSTEMS FOR THE LICENSING HAD BEEN PROGRAMMED AS IN A WAY TO NOT ACCOUNT FOR REQUIRING FEES. SO HAD TEMPORARY LICENSE HE'S BEEN REQUIRED TO USE THE TRUCK INTEREST SYSTEM LICENSING AUTHORITIES WOULD OF HAD TO CHARGE FEES. AND THAT PROGRAMMING TO CHANGE THE SYSTEMS AT THAT JUNCTURE WOULD HAVE JEOPARDIZED OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE TEMPORARY LICENSES AS OF JANUARY FIRST SO WE WERE CAUGHT IN A REAL. THE POSITION OF HAVING TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS BECAUSE THIS HAD TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. AND DECISIONS HAD TO BE MADE PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. SO DO TO THOSE TIME LINES. THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES GOT TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY DECIDED THAT WHAT WE WOULD DO IS TO TRAIN THE LICENSEES ON THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM AT THE TIME THEY MAKE APPLICATION FOR AN ANNUAL LICENSE. WE DECIDED SO WE DECIDED THAT WE WOULD TRAIN THEM. AT THE TIME THEY MAKE APPLICATION AND THAT WE WOULD BE ISSUING THE UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS TO OUR IF ID TAGS. AFTER THEY RECEIVE THE TRAINING AND HAVE THEIR ANNUAL LICENSE. SO ONCE THAT ONCE THE ANNUAL APPLICANT IS NOTIFIED BY THE LICENSING AGENCY THAT THEIR APPLICATIONS BEEN ACCEPTED AND THEN WE WILL ALSO BE RECEIVING APPLICATION FEES. THEY'LL BE GETTING THEIR TRAINING AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE ANNUAL LICENSE THOUGH MEDULLA HAVE THIRTY DAYS TO GET THEIR RFID TAGS AND APPLY THOSE TO PRODUCTS. IN THE INTERIM. THEM TEMPORARY LICENSEES ARE REQUIRED TO USE PAPER SALES INVOICES OR RECEIPTS AND MANIFESTS AND THOSE ARE ALL PRESCRIBED BY EACH LICENSING AUTHORITY IN REGULATION. I'M IN COMPLIANCE WAS WHAT THE STATUTE REQUIRES. THE CONTENTS OF THE. THE CONTENTS OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE REQUIRED IN THE MANIFEST AT HOME WE HAVE A FILLABLE PDF THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED ON OUR WEBSITE TO ALLOW THE INDUSTRY TO USE THAT AS A. AS A GUIDELINE TO DOCUMENT. ALL THE ELEMENTS IN THAT TEMPLATE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT'S IN OUR REGULATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE AS AS. THE CHP MENTION AND LORI MENTIONED SO IN THE INTERIM DURING THIS TEMPORARY LICENSING PHASE WHEN THE LICENSEES ARE USING THE PAPER PROCESS. THE BUREAU HAS SET UP THE ABILITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE MANIFEST INFORMATION THEY HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR NUMBER AND AN EMAIL WHERE THEY CAN. CONTACT THE BUREAU IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS AND EVERY LICENSEE DURING DURING THIS TEMPORARY PHASE AS THEY TRANSFER PRODUCT FROM ONE LICENSEE TO ANOTHER. REQUIRED TO HAVE THOSE PAPER DOCUMENTS WITH THE PRODUCT AND EACH LICENSEE IS REQUIRED TO RETAIN THIS PAPER SO IT IT IT ESSENTIALLY WAS A WAS A TIMING ISSUE SO IS THERE A TIME. LIMIT FOR HOW LONG YOU CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY LICENSE SO TEMPORARY LICENSES ARE VALID FOR HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS. AND THEN THEY CAN BE EXTENDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL NINETY DAYS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE LICENSING AUTHORITY. FOR. THE INFIRM FOR STATED PURPOSE I MEAN FIRST SPECIFIC PURPOSE AND I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YEAH. WHEN WILL THE TEMPORARY AND IN THAT AND FROM THAT POINT ON EVERYBODY SHOULD RIGHT ARE YOU. COMES WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS. LIKE I SAID WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS HOME. LAST SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER WE KIND OF LOOKED AT THEIR THERE'S THIS FOR SIX MONTHS OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THURS AND OUR REGULATIONS AND AND EACH LICENSING AUTHORITIES REGULATIONS THERE IS MENTION OF A TRANSITION PERIOD AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT. TEMPORARY LICENSES BEING VALID FOR FOUR MONTHS AND THEN SOME CAN BE EXTENDED A NINETY DAY PERIOD AND THAT'S MORE TO ALLOW IF THE LICENSING AUTHORITY. IS HOW NEED SOME ADDITIONAL PROCESSING TIME THEY COULD EXTEND IT SO WE ENVISIONED THAT THIS FOR SIX MONTHS WOULD KIND OF BE A TRANSITION PERIOD ON WE WE GET PEOPLE AND TO TRACK AND TRACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION AND KIND OF THE CHALLENGES WITH TRYING TO DO STUFF SAID AFTER EMERGENCY REGULATIONS I MEAN THIS IS. PART OF THE CHALLENGE IT DOING IT THIS WAY. WITH EXPEDITED TIMELINES BOB THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS IS FOR MR GLICKMAN AND IT ESSENTIALLY IF I'M REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S COMING OUT OF OF THE AG'S OFFICE. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONE OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT I'M HEARING SO SO THERE'S THE. THERE'S THE. FEDERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL COMING IN AND DOING ENFORCEMENT AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THAT BUT. WHAT I'VE HEARD THE REAL ISSUE IS IS THE? INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND IN MY REGION THAT THEY'VE COME IN WITH AUDITOR'S AND THEY STARTED IT AT AT A DIFFERENT KIND OF PROCESS WHERE THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE. EXPENSES. THAT ARE BEING. AT USED AS BUSINESS EXPENSES BY THE. RETAILERS AND THEY ARE THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. CONFISCATED PRODUCT AND CLOSED. STORES DOWN. AND BECAUSE OF NOT AN AUDITING PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO IT E.. ILLEGAL DRUG ENFORCEMENT PROCESS ALTHOUGH THEY USE THE FACT THAT IT'S AN ILLEGAL PRODUCT. PER FEDERAL MONEY CUT GOVERNMENT AS IT THE EXCUSE TO COME AND. TAKEOVER PRODUCT NOT ALLOW A BUSINESS EXPENSES AS A TAX ISSUE HAVE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT HAPPEN AND IS THERE A STRATEGY. FOR HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT BECAUSE IT JUST IT UNDERMINES EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING TO A. TO HAVE. AND THE IRIS COME IN AND SAY YEAH BUT THIS IS STILL ILLEGAL AND WE CAN CONFISCATE WITHOUT A COURT ORDER. RIGHT IT AS FAR SPECIFIC EXAMPLES LIKE I CAN'T POINT TO ANY AND IF YOU IF YOU HAVE SOME OUR OFFICE WOULD CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED AND HEARING ABOUT THE ME IT IS AN ISSUE ARE AWARE OF AN AND SOMETHING OUR OFFICES MONITORING. I KNOW I IN COLORADO THERE WERE THERE WERE REPORTS LAST FALL OF OF SIMILAR ACTIVITIES BY BY THE IRS. UNFORTUNATELY AS THE COMMITTEES ARE AWARE WE HAVE VERY LIMITED CONTROL OVER OVER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN AND THE AYE ARE ASKED IN IN IN A QUIRK OF FEDERAL LAW EVEN ILLEGAL DRUG TRAFFICKING UNDER FEDERAL LAW. YOU'RE REQUIRED TO PAY YOUR TAXES AND YOU'RE NOT RECORD HERE NOT PERMITTED TO DEDUCT THOSE BUSINESS EXPENSES SO THAT AS YOU KNOW IT DOES PROVIDE. KIND OF THE THE EXCUSE FOR THE AYE ARRESTED TO COME AFTER THIS ACTIVITY I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE SUBJECTS THAT THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SARAH WOULD WOULD RAISE WITH THE US ATTORNEY'S WHEN THOSE MEETINGS HAPPEN. OUT ITS DEFINITION WERE AWARE OF. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND CERTAINLY HAS BEEN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE FOR ME TO STAY HERE THE PADDLE IN THE ARTICULATION OF WHERE WE ARE AND WHERE WE STAND IN CALIFORNIA. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THIS ONE IS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. YOU MADE MENTION THERE'S. SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO APPLICANTS AND YOU. ALREADY ISSUED FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY WHAT HAPPENS THAT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO. LICENSE. BETTER STILL YET TO BE PROCESS IN APPROVED THAT'S ONE QUESTION FOR YOU. SO. LET ME GIVE YOU THE EXACT NUMBERS. AT WHICH MAY HELP A LITTLE THAT WE RECEIVED A TOTAL OF SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE WE'VE ISSUED FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX WERE WITHDRAWN BY THE APPLICANT USUALLY BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THEY THERE WERE SOME PIECE MISSING. HUNDRED TO WERE DETERMINED TO BE ON AUTHORIZED THAT MEANS THAT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION HAD NOT PROVIDED APPROVAL THIS IS A JOINT LICENSING. SO THERE IS THAT RIGHT NOW AS OF THIS MORNING WHERE THIRTY NINE THIRTY SIX EXCUSE ME APPLICATIONS IN THE QUEUE. OKAY. I'M YOU MADE MENTION ABOUT WORKSHOPS THREE WORKSHOPS THAT YOU HAVE THAT THE BUREAU HAS HOSTED. OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TEAMS UP UNTIL JANUARY FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN HAVE ANY OF THOSE BEEN IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. AND IF NOT ARE YOU PLANNING ON HAVING SOME THE WORKSHOPS IN THE LOS ANGELES AREA. SO THE THE WORKSHOPS AT THE BUREAU HOSTED WE DID HAVE ONE IN LA. AND WE ALSO HAD ONE AND. AND IRVINE IN WE WE WE CONTINUE TO PLAN TO DO THESE WORKSHOPS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND I KNOW BOTH PUBLIC HEALTH AND CDFA THEY ALSO DID A SPECIFIC WORKSHOPS JUST FOR THEIR. LICENSEES AND I'LL LET THEM TELL YOU WHERE THOSE WERE. ACTUALLY I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT LOCATIONS BUT WE BEHALF I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THIS TO YOU OUR REALLY DUNCE TEN SPECIFIC TO MANUFACTURERS AND I CAN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHERE THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. NO OVERALL I DON'T HAVE THE LOCATIONS WITH ME OKAY POLITICS YES. I RIBS A LOS ANGELES PORTION LOS ANGELES AND SO FOR ME EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT AND THESE WORKSHOPS IMPORTANT. AND THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE SPECIAL LOS ANGELES BEING SO HEAVILY POPULATED HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME AWAY IN CITIES WORKSHOPS. AND NOTHAVING THEM ISN'T IS NOT AN OPTION. WHERE DOES THE DMV FIT IN ALL THIS BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING TERMS THAT A DMV AND IN TERMS OF THEIR EDUCATION AND THEIR? BODY AND. AS PART THIS PROCESS. I KNOW THERE'S A PLACE FOR. CONSUMER TALK ABOUT THE PLACE THE NASCENT. ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS. CERTAINLY I MEAN GIVE IT HAS NO SPECIFIC ROLE IN THE REGULATIONS I MEAN WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM IN GENERAL ABOUT ENFORCEMENT ISSUES AND. WHEN IT COMES THAT LICENSING AND REGISTRATION BUT WE HAD OCCASION TO TALK ABOUT THIS. I'M SURE WE WILL ENCOUNTER% SITUATIONS THAT MIGHT INFORM THOSE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS BUT. I CAN CERTAINLY CHECK IN WITH A FOLLOW UP TO YOUR OFFICE. THANK YOU THEIR THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS TO THE HIGH PATROLLING ALSO COMMISSIONERS AND STANLEY CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING COMMISSIONER. THAT THREE MILLION DOLLARS BEING SET ASIDE UNDERSTAND THAT THE. I GUESS THE DISTRIBUTION DID YOU SAY IS STARTED ALREADY. AMITABH% DONNA UNDERSTOOD YOU TO SAY. IS ONE OF YOU. THAT. MONIES ARE COMING AND IT THE EDUCATION IS COMING BUT. FULL IS NOT FUNDED I'M CONCERNED BY THAT. ARE BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAW THAT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA. AND I WAS A FOR PLEASE OPPORTUNITY YOU KNOW. EDUCATION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SPACE IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE IS BRAND NEW. AND THE TRAINING IS VERY CRITICAL. TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OR TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE ARREST NGUYEN WHEN CALLED UPON. SO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE YET TO GET THE TRAINING YET TO RECEIVE ON THE FUNDING FOR THE TRAIN. I'LL I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT THE THREE MILLION DOLLARS WE GOT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE GRE TRAINING THAT TRAINING HAS ROLLED OUT. AND WE TRAINED. SINCE IT HAS RULED OUT WE TRAINED AND ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THREE. DE ARTISTE THROUGHOUT THE STATE BOTH WITHIN CHP AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AND THAT TRAINING IS CONTINUING UNTIL THE END. INTO THE FISCAL YEAR NOW QUITE RICH SPEAK. ADD TO THE OTHER MONIES THAT. YOU'RE REFERRING TO. SO THE OTHER THE OTHER FUNDING POT. IS THAT THE LARGER POT FOR DO YOU Y. DE. ENFORCEMENT EDUCATION TRAINING FOR NOT ONLY SEES PEOPLE ALL OFFERS AGENCIES WE'VE BEEN TOLD IS THAT. THERE WILL NOT BE FUNDING FOR THAT POT OF MONEY UNTIL NINETEEN TWENTY. FISCAL YEAR AND SO IT YOU KNOW WE WE AGREE THERE'S OF THOSE THERE'S A LOT MORE MOBILE DO WHEN THAT MONEY AS IN. IN THE INTERIM WERE WERE WERE TRAINING MORE OFFICERS LIKE. CREATURE STANLEY DISCUSSED WERE HAVING A LOT MORE. EDUCATIONAL DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER OFFICERS WE HAVE STARTED THE A PATH DOWN THIS TASK FORCE THAT WILL INFORM THAT'S COMPOSED OF LAW LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES. CRIME LAB REPRESENTATIVES CRIMINAL AND SOCIAL GROUP REPRESENTATIVES. TO HELP US IDENTIFY HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE SPENDING THOSE FUNDS WHEN THEY COME AND SO WOULD THERE ARE THINGS WE ARE DOING. BUT YES WE ARE WE ARE FORCED WITH THE. DELAY AND GETTING LARGER PART OF THE MONEY FOR IT. THAT CONCERNS ME AYE AYE I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS BODY PUT THAT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ON CONDITION OF MONEY IS BEING RELEASED I GUESS I DON'T KNOW. BUT IT REALLY CONCERNS BECAUSE AGAIN. WHO ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY WOMEN NEEDS THIS TRAINING SO THEY CAN EFFECTIVELY AFFECTED YOUR ARRESTS? AGAIN WHEN NECESSARY AND TO HAVE THAT TRAINING THERE DOES. WORKING BLINDLY IN THIS WEEK IN THIS SPACE. SO JUST. ONCE GET. MORE INFORMATION ON THIS IS TO. THEY'RE TURNING GENERAL'S OFFICE OF MISTER GLICKMAN. YEAH. BECAUSE OF. YOU MADE MENTION OF MR SESSIONS. IN HIS ROLE AND MY COLLEAGUE WAS CABRIO TALKED ABOUT THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE. WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SPACE BY WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS STILL LOOKING AT THIS AS THE? YOU KNOW AS A ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE. AND WE HAVE A FRAMEWORK WHICH WAS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE AND THEY WOULD NOT. ENFORCING RAIN THINGS OF THAT NATURE. PEOPLE ARE STILL A VERY. NERVOUS IN THIS SPACE. BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOT IT. LOOKING AT OR ALLOWING MORE HEARING TO. WHAT WAS DONE PREVIOUS DE IS THERE AN INDICATION THAT YOU CAN ARTICULATE TODAY? AROUND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS TERMS OF ENFORCING ENFORCEMENT OF THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO INDICATE THIS IS STILL. UP AGAINST THE LAW AND IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SIZE AND WHAT IMPACT IS GOING TO HAVE ON THOSE WHO ARE. LEAGUE LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHOSE WORKING AND WORKING THE SPACE. CERTAINLY. THANK YOU SO AS YOU KNOW WHEN ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS IN EARLY JANUARY RESCINDED THE PRIOR GUIDANCE FOR. FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGAINST CANNABIS CRIMES IT CREATED A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT IN IN THE VARIOUS OTHER STATES WITH REGULATED CANNABIS. WHAT ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS DID IS HE DID NOT DICTATING NEW ENFORCEMENT POLICY DID NOT DIRECT HIS PROSECUTORS TO GO AFTER? CANNABIS CRIMES WITH WHAT HE DID IS HE HE. SAID THAT THOSE PROSECUTOR SHOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION IN LINE WITH OTHER DEPARTMENT PRIORITIES TO DO SO. AND SO THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF THAT IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE OTHER STATES IS GOING TO DEPEND ON THE DECISIONS OF THOSE US ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE. AND AS I MENTIONED ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT SARAH THE NEXT DAY AFTER I ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS WITH THROUGH THE CALL MEMO. REACHED OUT ALL FOUR U. S. ATTORNEYS IN THE STATE AYE TO BEGIN A DIALOGUE ABOUT WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES MAY BE AND IF THERE WILL BE ANY CHANGES IN THEIR PRIORITIES WITH RESPECT TO CANNABIS ENFORCEMENT. HOW SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN A CONTINUING EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN OUR OFFICE AND AND THOSE FOR OFFICES? BUT THERE'S NOT BEEN YET. OF THE MEETING THAT WE'RE PLANNING TO HAVE WITH ALL FOUR US ATTORNEYS AND SO I THINK AFTER THAT MEETING WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THEIR PRIORITIES MIGHT BE. TO DATE WE'VE SEEN. NO CONCRETE CHANGE IN POLICY EITHER IN CALIFORNIA AND AS I MENTIONED I I PARTICIPATE IN A MULTISTATE WORKING GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM FROM OTHER. CANNABIS LEGAL STATES AND THEY'VE SEEN NOTHING IN IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES TO INDICATE A YOU KNOW A SEA CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A YOU KNOW A SERIOUS CONCERN FOR FOR OUR STATE AND FOR OUR OFFICE IN PARTICULAR. SOMETHING WE'RE MONITORING VERY CLOSELY. JUST PAUSING CHEST. SO. AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS HAVE BEEN CERTAINLY DISPROPORTIONATELY INCARCERATED. BY POSSESSION DISABUSE OF CANNABIS. BUT I'M CONCERNED YOU NOTE. THAT THE CONVERSATION HASN'T MOVED FORWARD IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIATION. SUMMER ó FRAMEWORK. BECAUSE I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD CERTAINLY LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AS RELATES TO THOSE WHO'VE BEEN RECENT CARCERI WHOSE PAY THAT THERE'S A DEBT TO SOCIETY TO COME OUT. AND ALSO BE ENTREPRENEURS IN THIS SPACE. AND BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS OPPORTUNITY FOR. ALL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS OPPORTUNITY FOR. INDIVIDUALS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO. TO BECOME CANOERS AND YOU KNOW AND BE A PART OF THIS NEW A BALDING INDUSTRY. AND CONCERNED THAT THIS IS JUST AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AGAIN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ECONOMY AND CERTAINLY. TARGET AFTER AMERICA'S A LATINO BUSINESSES IN THIS SPACE. AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS IS SOMETHING GOING TO BE. A SUBSTANTIATED IN WHICH CAN GIVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO CONVERT TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS SPACE BECAUSE THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA HAS IN FACT APPROVED SUCH TO BE THE CASE. I MEAN I THINK WE CAN GIVE THEM COMFORT IT IN THE SENSE THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT SARAH IS FIRMLY COMMITTED TO ENFORCING AND GIVING EFFECT TO STATE LAW. AND ANNA HAS HE SHOWN IN NUMEROUS OTHER POLICY AREAS WILL STAND TO DEFEND THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE IN THE WILL OF THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK THAT WOULD INCLUDE IF THERE WAS TARGETED ENFORCEMENT THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT WOULD WITH AND WOULD BE TAKING A HARD LOOK AT. UNFORTUNATELY AS I MENTIONED WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS WE CAN'T DICTATE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES OR DOESN'T DO IN THE SPACE. WHAT WE CAN DO IS MONITOR THE SITUATION ENGAGE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FIND AREAS OF COOPERATION THAT? ALL PARTIES AGREED ARE SHOULD BE PRIORITIES FOR ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO HOPEFULLY I STAND THAT THE CONSPIRATORS CONCERNS YOU RAISE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE NOT MISTER BONTA AND DOCTOR WOULD NOT JUST ONES P. MINDFUL OF THE TIME ALSO. THANK YOU OUR TOLIVER PANELISTS FOR BEING HERE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS DIALOGUE REALLY APPRECIATED THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE THANK YOU CELLO FOR CONVENING US. APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP. A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS I WANNA START WITH I'M. A FOLLOW UP WITH MISTER PARENT FOR YOUR POINTS ABOUT THAT THE PEOPLE MANIFESTS IN VERSES THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM IN SORT OF A TEMPORARY NATURE OF THAT I UNDERSTAND IT. AS WE TRANSITION TO THE FOUR TRACK AND TRACE. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW. YOU THINK THE PAPER MANIFEST SYSTEM COMPARES THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTING IN GUARDING AGAINST DIVERSION. I'M. I WOULD SAY THAT THE PAPER MANIFEST SYSTEM IS. IT'S. REQUIRING THE SAME ELEMENTS THAT THE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM WILL REQUIRE BUT ALLAH OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT IT BEING. IN AN INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC SYSTEM THAT MULTIPLE AGENCIES HAVE ACCESS TO IT DOES LIMIT US A BIT. DURING THIS PAPER NAM PROCESS AND WE. WE HAD THAT WAS ANOTHER THING THAT WE HAD DISCUSSED BACK AND. SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER BUT ALSO WORKING WITH THE. THE BUREAU AND WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION IN THE EVENT THAT THE TO PULL A VEHICLE OVER. WITH REGARD TO PREVENTING INVERSION DIVERSION AND AYE I'LL JUST SAY EVEN WITH THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. THAT STILL IN THERE A A SYSTEM THAT CONTAINS DATA THAT ALLOWS YOU TO. LOOK FOR ANOMALIES AND AND. THINGS AT FLAG FOR ALERTS. BUT. IT'S REALLY ALSO IT'S CRITICAL TO HAVE A STRONG ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM BOOTS ON THE GROUND. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LICENSEES ARE COMPLYING SO THAT'S THAT'S THE OTHER COMPONENT THAT WILL COMPLEMENT THIS PAPER PROCESS IS OUT US OUT THERE DOING INSPECTIONS DURING THIS TIME TO. GREAT THANK YOU. AND. SORT OF ALONG THOSE LINES IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO WAS THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDING. A BUDGET ALLOCATION TO HELP SPEED ALONG IMPLEMENTATION OF OF TRACK AND TRACE I KNOW THE PAST WHEN CAPITAL HAS BEEN A PROBLEM. WE'VE WE'VE TAKEN SOME LOANS OFF OF FUTURE REVENUE THAT WILL BE GENERATED THROUGH THAT. REGULATORY REGIME OR WE'VE EVEN. AT BEEN WILLING TECH CONSIDER. IT A BUDGET ALLOCATION SO. I WANT US KIND OF THINK CREATIVELY A NOT THAT I THINK YOU CAN HEAR THE PEOPLE WANT TRACK AND TRACE UP SOON AS POSSIBLE WE UNDERSTAND THAT CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE FACING. CAN WE HELP YOU OF AVOID THE CHAO OVERCOME THOSE CHALLENGES. I'M WE HADN'T TALKED ABOUT THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY DISCUSS IT AND AND COME SEE IF THERE'S ANY IDEAS THAT WE CAN COME UP WITH THAT MORE THAT COULD BE OF BENEFIT. SO WON'T WHEN AND WE MEET REGULARLY AT THE THE LICENSING AUTHORITIES. SO WE CAN DEFINITELY DISCUSS THAT. OKAY. THANK YOU I ALSO WANT TO ASK IS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE. ALLOCATING ENOUGH ENFORCEMENT REVENUE TO ADDRESSING THE BLOCKING GRAY MARKET ISSUES I I FEEL A LOT. OF THE SAME WAY THAT I KNOW MR LACKEY FEELS ABOUT. HOW WE START THIS PROCESS IS REALLY IMPORTANT? WE HAD ISSUED LICENSE ON LETTUCES ON JANUARY FIRST WALLET WHILE THE WEAR THAT. AB. AND WE'VE SORT OF ENTERED INTO THIS GRAND BARGAIN WITH THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY AND WE SAID IF IF YOU COME OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE LIGHT AND. EMBRACE A REGULATED MARKET AND FOLLOW ALL THE RULES AND PAY YOUR TAXES AND CREATE GOOD JOBS. YOU CAN BE PART OF. THAT THE NEW. SET OF RULES REGULATIONS AROUND CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA. PART OF THAT SAME. GRAND BARGAIN IS THAT THOSE WHO DON'T. THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE BLACK GRAY MARKET CAN'T BE PART OF. THE NEW ALBUM CANNABIS SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND SO. PARTICIPANTS IN THE BLACK GRAY MARKET CAN UNDERCUT THOSE. IN IN THE TIME REGULATED MARKET. WE KNOW THAT LICENSES AND FEES ARM. OUR ANTI TAXES ARE EXPENSIVE. IN THE REGULATED MARKET BUT NOT SO MUCH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING THE RULES IN THE IN THE BOTTOM GRAY MARKET SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THOSE WHO. EXCEPT THIS BUT IT THIS SORT OF SOCIAL COMPACT OF THIS BARGAIN AND AND AND EMBRACE THE REGULATED MARKET FEEL COMFORTABLE. THAT DOING SO WILL NOT LEAVE THEM UNDERCUT BY THE BLACK GREY MARKET WOULD WE NEED TO DO TO. PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ENFORCEMENT. FOR ONE. AND SECONDLY I DON'T ALONG QUESTION. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES THAT ARE. ADVERTISING ON LICENSE BIZ UNLICENSED BUSINESSES. WHAT WE DO IS A STATE TAX? I'M STOP THAT. GOOD MORNING. SO WE'VE ALREADY ALL THREE OF US HAVE ALREADY ALL THREE LICENSING AUTHORITY IS THE START OF OUR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON. AND WE ARE OF COURSE OF FOCUSING ON MAKING SURE STAFF MEANS APPROPRIATE FOR THE ENFORCEMENT OUT THERE A WINDING THE BUREAU IS ALREADY. NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING OUT TO THE LICENSED PREMISES AND DOING INSPECTIONS WERE ALSO GETTING A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM THE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THEM LICENSE MARKET TO TELL US WHO IS OUT THERE OPERATING ILLEGALLY. BUT WE'RE ALSO HAVING FOLKS THAT ARE GOING ON THESE INNER WITH IT YOU KNOW THAT WEBSITES AND COLLECTING DATA. YOU KNOW SEEN WHO'S ON THERE AND SEEN WHOSE LICENSE TO USE DISPLAYING THEIR LICENSE NUMBER WE ARE FOLLOWING UP WITH EMAILS LETTERS AND WE ARE PHONING THEM. AND TELLING THEM HATE YOU EITHER YOU NEED TO GET LICENSED AND AND WE ARE OF GOD OF A HUGE RESPONSE OF PEOPLE. ARE SAYING I I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO START I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT GETTING IT SO WE ARE WE ARE AYE CASE I WAS SAYING I KNOW WE ARE IN WEEK EIGHT OF LICENSING SO WE'VE BEEN REALLY TRYING HARD TO FOCUS ON. EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE WHETHER IT'S OUR LICENSEES ARE THE UNLICENSED FOLKS BUT THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FOLLOW IT UP THOSE THAT ARE. COMING INTO COMPLIANCE BECAUSE WE'RE KEEPING THOSE THOSE THAT THAT DATA AND WE YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE SOME STRONG SWIFT ENFORCEMENT. DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE THE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO TO GET THE JOB DONE. I I DO I I FEEL THAT THIS IS ALSO A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO AN AND WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF COORDINATING WITH THEM A LOT OF EDUCATION HAVING ARE ENFORCEMENT FOLKS ARE. YOU KNOW GO OUT AND TALK TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ON BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM I THINK IT IT TAKES BOTH OF US GOT WORKING TOGETHER TO GET THIS DONE AND I THINK YOU'RE SEEING THAT. AS I THINK AS NOW IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO HAVE A STATE LICENSE I THINK IT'S CLEAR TO. TO ALSO THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO BE APPROVED THROUGH THERE YOU HAVE TO BE APPROVED OF THE STATE SO I THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT NOW HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF. IF YOU DON'T OF YOUR AND YOU NEED TO BE LICENSE SO I THINK. YOU KNOW AS AS AS WE FINALIZE THOSE REGULATIONS ARE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS I THINK THAT'S ALSO HELPED TO. SORRY IF I MISSED IT WOULD. DID YOU JUST ADVERTISING COMPONENT TO FOR FOR BUSINESSES THAT ARE ADVERTISING. IT YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE GETTING WORD BACK ON THAT AND THEN SENDING OUT LETTERS IS THAT WHAT I HEARD YEAH WE WE'RE GOING RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT THESE INTERNET EAT BECAUSE THERE THERE THERE'S A VARIETY OF INTERNET PLATFORMS OUT THERE THAT. FOLKS ARE ADVERTISING SO WE ARE GOING THROUGHFIGHT LOOKING THEM YOU KNOW LOOKING AT I'M GIVING HIM A CALL SENDING ME MAILS LETTERS AND SOME OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY LICENSE THEY JUST IN REALIZE THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR LICENSE NUMBER ON THERE. OTHERS OBVIOUSLY AREN'T LICENSE AND WERE BEING VERY CLEAR OF WHERE WE'RE FINDING THEIR ADVERTISEMENT. WE FOUND YOU HERE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO HAVE A LICENSE AND SO. WEEKS THAT'S OUR FIRST DOT THAT'S THE FIRST STEP OF THE PROCESS IS REALLY LETTING THEM KNOW. PUTTING THEM ON NOTICE AND THEN. OF FOLLOWING UP. SO YOU TO FOLLOW UP THROUGH FULL LICENSURE. FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WERE NOWHERE YEAH WE WE JUST STARTED THIS. LAUGHS. IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS SO YES IT'S. IT'S THEN MAKING SURE WE HAVE RECORDS ON WHO WE'VE NOTIFIED WHAT. HOW WE NOTIFIED THEM WHAT WE YOU KNOW WHAT OUR CONVERSATION WAS AND THEN FOLLOWING UP WITH THEM? THANK YOU THINK MISTER CHAIR BECAUSE BONTA DOCTOR BUT. THANK YOU AND I THAT'S WHAT A FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION I'M I HAVE SOME OTHERS SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING OUT AND AT THE PEOPLE WHO. ARE. ARE MAYBE NOT THE LICENSE THAT OUR ADVERTISING WHAT ABOUT THE PORTALS THEMSELVES THAT ARE CONDUCTING THE ADVERTISED ARE TO BE EDUCATED THEM ABOUT. DO THEY HAVE PROTOCOLS FOR SCREENING PEOPLE HOW ARE YOU HOW ARE YOU DOING THAT DO THEY HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY AT ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT HE PEOPLE THAT THEIR ADVERTISING FOR OUR LICENSED. YEAH I THINK THE STATUTES UP VERY CLEAR THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY ARE ADVERTISING HAVE A LICENSE NUMBER SO WE HAVE A DEBT. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THOSE INTERNET PLATFORMS AND WE HAVE FOLLOWED UP WITH THEM WITH THE LETTER A STEAM MAKING SURE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STATUTE SAYS WHAT'S THE REQUIREMENTS. AND. MAKING THAT CLEAR AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID I THINK IT STARTS FIRST WITH. PUTTING THEM ON NOTICE IN EDUCATING THEM AND THEM AND FOLLOWING UP ON. AND MAKING SURE THAT. THEY'RE COMPLYING. VERY MUCH. EVER READY QUESTIONS AND I KNOW WEEK WE'RE STILL SHORT ON TIME SO BE A BE A PRETTY QUICK. NO CDFA YOU HAD HAD A STUDY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY MENTION WE HAD ABOUT. PRODUCTION ABOUT THIRTEEN AND A HALF MILLION POUNDS OF CANNABIS BUT CONSUMPTION OF PRODUCTION TO THIRTEEN AND HALF MILLION BUT. CONSUMPTION IN CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ABOUT TWO AND HALF MILLION SUCH A BIG GAP THERE. AND THERE WAS A LOCAL AGENCY IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOP IN DECEMBER. WHERE WAS SAID THAT ILLEGAL OPERATIONS WILL BE BIRTH BE REFERRED BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS THAT YOUR POLICY TO REFER BACK? AND IF SO HOW WERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GOING TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND SO AND AND THE ABILITIES. TO CRACK INTO SOME THESE MULTI STATE MULTI. CARTELS THAT ARE RUNNING SOME THESE OPERATIONS. AND SO I THE IT THAT WAS A YOU SAID THERE WAS A COMMENT MADE IT ONE OF THE LIFE IS LOWER LATENCY IMPLEMENTATION WORKSHOP OKAY. I'M NOT I'M I'M BOYS AND I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT BUT I. IF WE ARE MADE AWARE OF. YOU'RE SAYING ILLEGAL GROWS ISN'T. IT SAID BASICALLY THAT IN WHERE WAS SAID THAT LEE ILLEGAL OPERATIONS WOULD BE PREFERRED BACK TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPOSED TO HANDLE THAT. HANNAH AND THAT MAY HAVE. IT MAY HAVE JUST BEEN AS THE FEDERAL SEE THEM WILL KNOW OURS SO IF IF WE ARE FOR INSTANCE ON THIS THIS TIP LINE THAT WE HAVE IF WE RECEIVE INFORMATION WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON IT. WE'LL SEE IF THEY'RE LICENSED WITH US IF THEY'RE NOT. WE'RE GONNA BE EDUCATING COME BUT IF IT. IF IT'S A MATTER WHERE WE DO NEED TO REFER TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OUR LOCAL. LOCAL AGENCIES WILL BE WORKING IN COOPERATION WITH THEM WE AT CFA OUR INSPECTORS ARE NOT CERTIFIED PEACE OFFICERS WERE NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME POWERS AS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WE WOULD BE REFERRING INFORMATION AND WORKING WITH THEM AND COOPERATING TO THE TO THE BEST EXTENT THAT WE CAN. AND STATE AGENCIES AS WELL OR JUST LOCAL YES IS STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL ANY OF THEM THAT WE WOULD BE AND AND ARE WE HAVE. WE DO HAVE PLANS TO. WERE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EDUCATING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WORKING WITH THEM. AND ALSO THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND WORKING WITH THESE I'M FORMING ENFORCEMENT PARTNERSHIP SO THAT WE HAVE. A VAST NETWORK. AT THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES MORE WE CAN CONTACT REFER MATTERS IF IF THEY ARE. OUTSIDE OF OUR PURVIEW OR IF THEY'RE PARTLY OURS AND INVOLVE OTHER AGENCIES WHILE. SO YOU YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR IN YOUR TESTIMONY HAVE THANK YOU SAID YOU'VE ISSUED FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX LICENSES AS OF. EIGHT AM TODAY. ACCORDING TO THE DATE YET SO THAT'S THAT WOULD BE LIKE A COUPLE HOURS AGO YES SO THOSE ARE CULTIVATE THOSE ARE FIFTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX CULTIVATION LICENSE AND HE ICE CULTIVATION LICENSES SO SOME ESTIMATES ARE THAT OUR SON ARTICLE THIS MORNING SIXTY EIGHT. THOUSAND CULTIVATORS THAT'S ABOUT TWO PERCENT. WE GOT A WAYS TO GO OBVIOUSLY CORRECT IN IT YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT SOME OF IT. THAT THE KEY THING IS THAT BEFORE WE CAN ISSUE THE STATE TEMPORARY LICENSE THE APPLICANT DOES NEED TO HAVE LOCAL APPROVAL AND IN SOME CASES THAT IS WHERE THE. THEY ARE IN SOME CASES THE APPLICANTS WAITING ON LOCAL APPROVAL SO WE DO HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AND I'M KIND OF JUMPING AROUND HERE SO SOME LOCAL THERE ARE SOME LOCAL TRACK ENTRY SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE HUMBOLDT COUNTY ONE HAS ONE WILL THAT BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE WITH THE STATE OR HOUSE SECOND WORK. YES SO AND WERE WERE ACT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE'RE TALKING WITH THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. IT. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE FOR INSTANCE A LOCAL. THE THE LOCAL TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM WON'T. THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY USING THEIR THEY'RE NOT USING THE STATE. RFID TAGS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS FOR THE STATE'S SYSTEM. SO WE WE ARE GOING TO ALLOW WHAT WE WOULD CALL THEM. LOCAL. THIRD PARTY VENDOR INTEGRATION WITH OUR SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO. LIKE INTERFACE BUT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS THAT A LOCAL TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM WOULD BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE THE STATE TRACK ENTRY SYSTEM THAT THE GOAL IS. WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT THE LICENSEE TO HAVE TO DUPLICATE EFFORTS AND SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON. ANY AREAS WHERE WE CAN PREVENT AN OVERLAP ADJUDICATED DUPLICATION OF EFFORTS BUT WE'RE JUST NOT SURE WHAT THAT'S WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE GET. WHERE THE CONCERNS? SURELY. I KNOW IF I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD THIS. THERE'S THERE'S NOW THERE'S COME ABOUT THERE'S A LACK OF A CUMULATIVE CULTIVATION CAP. NOW. SO YOU CAN SEE THE FAA ISSUED AND HE AYE ARE. THAT INDICATED THERE WOULD BE A ONE ACRE CAP. YET VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT. WHEN THE REX CAME OUT. IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT. AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS. OBTAIN AS MANY TYPE TO LICENSES AS THEY WANTED TO. EXPENSIVE OBVIOUSLY. BUT. IN THE SPIRIT OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH PROMISED. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL GROWERS TO GET. A FOOTHOLD GET INTO THIS MARKET. THAT BLEW A HUGE HOLE IN THAT OPPORTUNITY. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE LOGIC BEHIND THAT BECAUSE THE PROMISE TO THE VOTERS. AND THE PROMISED TO THE GROWERS AND AND THE FOLKS AT WORK ON MC ARE AT SAY. WAS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SMALL GROWERS AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF GROWERS. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OR LESS. SO THIS ALLOWS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LARGELY CAPITALIZE PEOPLE TO COME IN. AND AND TAKE THIS MARKET. AWAY FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR YEARS SO. THERE'S A DISCONNECT HERE AND I'M JUST. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT. AND A DOCTOR WOULD I I I. APOLOGIZE THAT I CANNOT ANSWER. BECAUSE THIS IS SUBJECT OF CURRENT LITIGATION MY LEGAL COUNSEL AT CDF PHASE THAT HAS ADVISED ME THAT I'M NOT ABLE. TO DISCUSS THE MATTER IN RESPONSE CONTENTIOUS AYE WAY BECAUSE I THESE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED BEFORE LITIGATION. BEFORE LITIGATION ANYONE ANSWERED. AND I'VE I APOLOGIZE AND I'M UNABLE TO ANSWER THEM TODAY BUT OUR GENERAL COUNSEL HAS ADVISED ME THAT I AM NOT. ABLE TO DO TO DISCUSS IT TODAY. OKAY. WITH C.. ONE OTHER LAST QUESTION HERE. A COUPLE. DOCTOR SMITH. THE STATUS OF TYPE ES LICENSES. YOU NOT MANDATED TO DO THAT I UNDERSTAND BUT YOU INDICATED YOU WERE GOING TO DO YES WERE ACTIVELY WORKING ON THOSE RIGHT NOW WE ARE. ANTICIPATING RELEASING EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IN THE NEAR FUTURE. GREAT THANK YOU. AND THIS TO MR OF MR GLICKMAN. YEAH ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE HAD A NIGHT IT'S REASON LIKE STARTED WORKING ON THIS ISSUE WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE WAS. THE THAT DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT FROM ON REGULAR HERE ON UNLICENSED UNREGULATED ROW GROWS AND. WE'VE SEEN THAT. AND YOU CAN ASK THEIR VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES LOCAL AGENCIES WHO ARE AWARE OF THIS. THE USE OF LLC'S BEING. USED TO SHIELD BAD ACTORS I MEAN LAYER UPON LAYER UPON LAYER TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T. GET TO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR THAT IN WE AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HEARD AND I'M NOT THE EXPERT ON THIS BUT I KNOW THAT THEIR PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT. THAT THIS IS BEING USE A SHIELD HOW STATE OUT OF COUNTRY. PEOPLE WHO WERE REALLY QUITE FRANKLY. DESTROYING OUR ENVIRONMENT. IS THERE AN APPROACH AT SOME POINT I THINK WE TALKED WE MET WE TALKED WITH THE. GENERAL ABOUT THIS HOW WE GO AFTER THESE BAD ACTORS WHEN YOU HAVE WE'RE TRYING ON THE OTHER HAND. TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND YET THERE'S BEEN A HUGE PROLIFERATION OF THIS ACTIVITY IN THE LAST YEAR SINCE ACTUALLY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. HOW DO WE DO THAT? WE'VE GOT PEOPLE IT'S EXPENSIVE IT'S IT'S CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE OF NEVER DONE ANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES TO DO THAT. HOW DO WE? WHAT WE DO TO TO MAKE THIS FAIR FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO? BE GOOD GOOD MEALBUSINESS PEOPLE AND AND COMPLY WITH STATE LAW. NOW I I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN THESE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE NOT UNIQUE TO CANNABIS WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT CANNABIS. IS IT HAS THE LEGAL MARKET. THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTING IT'S AN ISSUE I I BELIEVE YOU REYES WITH OUR OFFICE AND AND WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT OUR OWN RESOURCES. YOU KNOW WE DO FINANCIAL FRAUD PROSECUTIONS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE THAT THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO PULL RESOURCES FROM THERE OR LEVERAGE SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT THE EXPERTISE THAT THEY HAVE TO ASSIST THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. BUT IT'S A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM AND I AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. THAT'S TIED INTO ALL OF THIS. ONE THAT'S ONE AREA WE'VE IDENTIFIED AS A POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY COOPERATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LAST FALL I ATTENDED A CONFERENCE WITH THE EASTERN DISTRICT HERE HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ALL ABOUT THEIR FEDERAL PROSECUTION. EXCUSE ME OF ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES AND SO THAT IS A FOCUS PRE RECESSION OF THE CALM OF THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE A CONTINUING FOCUS FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE THE MANPOWER AND RESOURCES THAT COULD HOPEFULLY ASSIST AND UNTANGLING THESE COMPLEX BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT. BUT SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM ONE WERE AWARE OF AND ONE WERE ACTIVELY WORKING TO SOLVE DESERVES SOMETHING YOU NEED FROM THE LEGISLATURE FOR THEM. UP THERE MAY WELL BE I I DON'T HAVE IT TODAY BUT I. EXPECT THAT WE WE IF THERE IS WILL CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION TO YOU ACTUALLY IS THE FOUR U. S. ATTORNEYS. SOME OF THEM ARE INTERIM OR THEY HAVE THEY ALL CONFIRMED HER THING. I NEED THEM CONFIRMED I BELIEVE NONE OF THEM ARE YOU CONFIRMED AT THIS POINT. TO HAVE NOW BEEN FORMALLY NOMINATED ONE JUST THIS MORNING. HEAD OF THE CENTRAL DISTRICT AYE NICKEL HANNAH WAS NOT OFFICIALLY NOMINATED BY PRESIDENT TRUMP THIS MORNING. ALSO THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT I BELIEVE HAS BEEN. OFFICIALLY NOMINATED THE OTHER ONES ARE ACTING IN INTERIM OR ACTING CAPACITY. AN INTERIM APPOINTMENT IS ONE THAT'S DONE BY ATTORNEY GENERAL SESSIONS AND HAS AN EXPIRATION DATE. WHERE THEY CAN ONLY STAY IN THAT POSITION I THINK FOR A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS? AND WITH THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD THEN NOMINATE THEM AND THEY GO THROUGH THE FORMAL PROCESS TYPICALLY. AND THEN IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT THERE WAS RETIREMENT AND SO THERE'S AN ACTING U. S. ATTORNEY IN THE NORTHERN JUST. AND NO NOMINEE AT ALL SO CONVERSATIONS WITH THESE FOUR MIGHT. NOT REALLY GIVE CLEAR RESOLUTION BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY BE CONFIRMED RIGHT. YEAH I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A A MONTH AND A HALF ROUGHLY SINCE THE COLEMAN WAS RESCINDED AND THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS DIRT THEY'RE STILL TRYING TO GET. VERY MUCH TRYING TO GET THEIR OWN DUCKS IN A ROW AND UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND THAT THE DIRECTIONS FROM ABOVE AND SO I I THINK THAT IT THAT IS AN ISSUE BUT. YOU KNOW THIS WILL BE A ONE AND DONE MEETING WE HAD WE ANTICIPATE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE FEDERAL PROSECUTORS MAKE YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU TO EVERYONE APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK I I CAN ONLY I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE DIFFICULTY. AND THAT'S ON CONSIDERING THE TIMELINE TO PUT ALL THIS TOGETHER SO I WHILE WHILE WERE POINTED IN OUR QUESTIONS HERE I DON'T BITE WE CAN'T STATE ENOUGH HOW DIFFICULT THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN FOR YOU AND. AND APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT THAT YOU'RE ALL DOING HERE SO ON BUT IT'SIT'S A IT'S A BIG NUT TO CRACK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ECHO THOSE COMMENTS IN SUMMARY OF THE CONVERSATIONS. THAT WE'VE HAD COLLECTIVELY I THINK IT'S DIFFICULT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO IDENTIFY THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THAT OF THE VOTER INITIATIVE. AND THAT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THEY JUST SEE A SIMPLY AS GOVERNMENT AND SO WITH THE OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THIS. IS SIGNIFICANT AND WHAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF OUR COLLEAGUES IS A DEEP PASSION THAT TO GET THIS RIGHT. MOST CERTAINLY BY THE RECOGNITION OF SO MANY OF YOU AT THE DICE IT IS DIFFICULT WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT ENTITIES. AT HAND AND SO WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES COLLECTIVELY I HAD A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS BUT JUST ONE TO KEEP JUST ONE A VERY BRIEF WHICH IS RESPECT TO ADVERTISEMENTS AGAIN. AND PERHAPS IT WILL BE LOWER AND MISS AJAX MR PARA OR A DOCTOR SMITH WAS RESPECT ADVERTISING. BUT EVEN AND JUST IN THIS. SACRAMENTO. NEWS AND REVIEW. A AND THIS IS AS OF. THURSDAY FEBRUARY EIGHTH. ARE AND JUST ON ONE PAGE ON PAGE FORTY FOUR. WE HAVE FOUR ADVERTISEMENTS HERE AND A THREE OF THE FOUR. DO NOT HAVE THE PROPER DISCLOSURE OF THEIR LICENSE. THREE OUT OF FOUR AND THIS IS AS OF JUST FEBRUARY EIGHTH. AND SO THIS IS THE COMPLETE. DISREGARD AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF THE RESPECT OF THE LAW AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE GOOD ACTORS. THIS IS NOT IT ENDEAVOR AND SUBJECT THE APPROPRIATE TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT AND SO WHAT WHO OF THE THREE. IS FOCUSED ON. THE ENFORCEMENT AND ALSO SAY WE WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AND VISIT JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH SOME OF THE ADVERTISING THAT WE SAW AND ENTERED IN THE APPROPRIATE LICENSE. AT WHICH WE FOUND THAT SOME OF THEM WERE FICTITIOUS. SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT AND YOUR WORDS YOU MENTIONED STRONG AND SWIFT ENFORCEMENT AND AGAIN THIS IS A COLLECTIVE EFFORT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT US AS A GOVERNMENT BODY. SO THAT WOULD BE THE BUREAU'S RESPONSIBILITIES TO. REGULATE THE ADVERTISING AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT ITS ITS VAST IT'S NOT JUST UP PRINT IT'S IT SAW BILLBOARDS AND INTERNET PLATFORMS. US SO AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS COMING OUT OF THE CANNABIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS THERE IS AN ENFORCEMENT SUBCOMMITTEE AND WHAT CAME OUT OF IT LAST WEEK WAS OF PERHAPS. YOU KNOW DOING DEDICATED ENFORCEMENT JUST FOR ADVERTISING AND SO I THINK IT'S IT'S TAKING A LOOK AT OUR RESOURCES AND AND WE'RE ALREADY DEDICATING A LOT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT STAFF JUST ON THIS ADVERTISING BECAUSE IT IS THAT IMPORTANT TO BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT IT. IT IS IT IS PREVALENT AS. WE KNOW IT DID NOT JUST IN SACRAMENTO ACROSS THE STATE AND IT IS JEOPARDIZING. THE REGULATED MARKET AND AND I JUST WANT YOU KNOW WE WE'RE DEBT WE WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT BY THE WAY AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE ALREADY PUTS THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. AND. WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. AND SO THE DIVERT TIMING THOUGH. ON ON THE ISSUE AT HAND AND IT MENTIONED I KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST GONNA WIN BUT THIS WAS VERY TH AND I THINK THAT'S THE EXPECTATIONS OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND. THE RESPECTIVE ENTITIES THAT ENFORCEMENT ACTION IS TAKEN I THINK IHEARD YOU PREVIOUSLY THAT WERE QUESTIONS ASKED YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES WITH ENFORCEMENT YOU SAID YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ANSWER IS YES. BUT IF WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY BAD ACTORS RIGHT NOW THEN IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IN TIGHTENING FACT THAT WOULD BE. CONTRARY TO. WHAT YOU HAD MENTIONED? WELL I I THINK THAT THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE BUREAU WE'RE ALSO STILL GETTING STAFFED UP SO AT RIGHT NOW DO I HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO COME BACK ALL THIS ADVERTISING PROBABLY. I WILL HAVE AND I AM BUT SO WHAT WE DO IS WHEN EVEN THOUGH OUR ENFORCEMENT STAFF MIGHT NOT BE FULLY. WE HAVEN'T HIRED EVERYBODY FULLY WEEK WE HAD I HAVE DIVERT OTHER RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE IT'S THAT IMPORTANT WHETHER IT'S. RESOURCES FROM OTHER AREAS OF THE BUREAU'S BECAUSE WE'VE REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT IT IS I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THOUGH THAT WE WE CONTINUE TO ISSUE LICENSES I MEAN WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF PENDING APPLICATIONS WE'VE GOT ISSUE THESE LICENSES WE GOT TO CONTINUE DOING THAT SO. IT IS A BALANCE SEEN OF MAKING SURE WE'RE CONTENT WE DON'T STOP ISSUING LICENSES AND OUT WE'RE EDUCATING PEOPLE ON HOW TO GET LICENSED. AND THAT WERE NOTIFYING PEOPLE I THINK. I'LL TELL YOU WE'VE MADE I THINK OVER. WE SENT OUT OVER A FIVE HUNDRED. LETTERS AND EMAILS AND WE FOLLOWED UP WITH SEVERAL HUNDRED PHONE CALLS AND IT IS A STRONG MESSAGE WHEN THEY HEAR. THIS IS THE BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL THIS IS WHERE WE FOUND YOUR ADVERTISING AND YOU ARE NOT YOU ARE CURRENTLY NOT DOESN'T APPEAR YOUR LICENSE OR HAVE YOUR LICENSE NUMBER. AND I KNOW IT MAY NOT SOUND LIKE AND A NUFF BUT IT IS A I THINK IT IS A OF THE FIRST STEP IN THE PROCESS AND THEN FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT AND MAKING SURE WE'RE FOLLOWING UP AND SO. AYE I THINK WE ARE AS WE YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A WEEK EIGHT OF IMPLEMENTATION I THINK WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT OKAY WHERE DO WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES SO I THINK IT'S JUST A MATTER OF US. TRANSITIONING NOW INTO ENFORCEMENT AND LOOKING TAKING MAKING THAT ADVERTISING A PRIORITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE IN CASE OF THIS SIZE THE SACRAMENTO NEWS REVIEW ENFORCEMENT ACTION IS IT TO BE ON THE PUBLISHED PUBLICATION OR IS IT ON THAT. THE ACTUAL DISPENSARY. YEAH YOU DON'T IT DEPENDS. I KNOW WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC INTERNET PLATFORM THAT ACTUALLY ARE ISSUING. LIKE THEIR OWN LICENSE WHICH IS PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE THE STATE ISSUED LICENSE SO. REALLY IT'S GONNA IF SOMEBODY'S LICENSED AND THEY HAVE BEEN ISSUED THEIR LICENSE AND THAT THAT THERE WOULD BE A VIOLATION THAT WOULD BE A VIOLATION BUT IF THEY'RE UNLICENSED. THEN THAT WOULD BE ON BOTH THAT EITHER THE INTERNET PROVIDER OR THE MEDIA. OF IT BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS BASED ON THE INFORMATION IN THAT AD. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WORK AND I HOPE YOU'LL INTERPRET OUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS IS THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE IN TRYING TO GET THIS RIGHT AND WE RELY ON YOUR. DATED A EXPERTISE TO HELP ASSIST US IN THAT DIRECTION THAT WE ARE COLLECTIVELY HEADED AND SO THAT AGAINST ALL THE PANELISTS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR YOUR DEDICATION ON THIS ISSUE. AND WE VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU CLUB ROUGHLY THANK YOU. WITHOUT TRANSITION INTO THE SECOND PANEL OF THAT WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON ISSUES FAKE FACING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND SO WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS TO JOIN US. THE FIRST PERSON IS CARE MARTINSON LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. AND WE HAVE TIM CROMARTIE SENIOR ADVISER FOR H. DE L. COMPANIES. AND JONATHON FELDMAN LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. AGAIN THIS PANEL WILL BE FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON ISSUES SPEAKING FACING A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND. MISS MARCIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS KAREN MARTIN'S AND I'M A SENIOR LEGISLATIVE REPRESENTATIVE. OF WHAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SEE SACK UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE YOUR COMMENTS TODAY ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STATES CANNABIS LAWS FROM THE COUNTY. PERSPECTIVE UM C. SUCK FOUGHT VERY HARD TO RETAIN THE LOCAL CONTROL THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE ANSWER I SAY. PROP SIXTY FOUR AND THEN THE COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO LAWS. THIS REALLY ALLOWS. CITY COUNCILS AND BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS TO. IMPLEMENT. COMMERCIAL CANNABIS REGULATORY PROGRAMS THAT RESPECT THE WAY ALL OF THEIR COMMUNITY CHOOSING WHICH TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. THEY WOULD LIKE TO PERMANENT FOR BANNED THE COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. ALTOGETHER SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. AS A RESULT THE. THE LANDSCAPE OF REGULATION. CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HOWEVER I AS WE WERE NOT HELD TO THE SAME STATUTORY TIME FRAME THAT THE STATE WAS TO BEGIN LICENSING ON JANUARY ONE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FOLKS THAT WE COLOR EARLY ADOPTERS AT THAT WERE PREPARED AND READY IN THE US LICENSING HAS BEGUN. THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT HAVE REALLY EMBRACED THE INDUSTRY ARE THOSE THAT HAD EXPERIENCE AND REGULATING OF THE MODESTO MARKETPLACE. AND. AS YOU CAN MAKE A MATCH AND. WE KNOW WHO SEVERAL OF THOSE ARE BUT CURRENTLY JUST TO GIVE YOU SORT OF A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE STATE THERE ARE ABOUT SEVENTEEN. COUNTIES THAT HAVE. COMMERCIAL REGULATORY PROGRAM IN PLACE AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STAY. THAT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY. RUN THE GAMUT FROM OUR ROBUST REGULATORY PROGRAMS AND. MISTER WOODS DISTRICT UP IN THAT IN THE NORTH COAST TO. SOME OF OUR SMALL OR. DELIVERY ONLY SERVICES AND OR PROGRAMS EXCUSE ME IN MARIN AND VENTURA COUNTY. AND WHILE MANY COUNTIES ARE LEARNING FROM ONE ANOTHER AND LEARNING FROM OUR OUR CITIES AS WELL AS HE STOCK IS ACTUALLY REALLY WORKING TO FACILITATE THAT CONVERSATION AMONGST LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THAT THE PROGRAMS IN PLACE REALLY RESPECT UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL JURISDICTIONS AND REALLY WHY WE FOUGHT SO HARD FOR THAT LOCAL CONTROL ELEMENT. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BETTER IDEA OF HOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE TAILORED TO THE LOCAL LEVEL GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES. IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY WHICH IS I REALLY THE LEADER. IN CANNABIS REGULATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THEY'VE EMBRACED THE INDUSTRY BUT. HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED QUITE A BIT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES DUE TO A ON PERMANENT ON LICENSE ACTIVITY. SO TO. TO INCENTIVIZE COMPLIANCE. WHILE EMBRACING INDUSTRY THEY'VE DEVELOPED A LAND RETIREMENT REMEDIATION AND RELOCATION PROGRAM. AND THIS IS REALLY TO HELP INCENTIVIZE FOLKS TO GET OFF THE SLOPES INTO MORE APPROPRIATE LAND USES BY. INCENTIVIZING ZONING CLEARANCES IN OTHER AREAS FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER SO THAT'S A UNIQUE I THINK COMPONENT OF THEIR LOCAL PROGRAM THAT REALLY. RESPECT THAT MEANS. THAT THE COMMUNITY IS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCING. JUST A COUPLE OTHER EXAMPLES IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AS YOU KNOW THERE. VERY PROUD OF THEIR BRAND THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ASSOCIATE WITH INDUSTRY SO THEY'RE WORKING ON ORGANICS PROGRAM WITH THE STATE TO REALLY IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS THAT LEADER. AND THEN ALSO TO GET TO THE POINT OF INCENTIVIZING THE SMALLER. BUSINESSES AND GROWERS AND RESPECTING SORT OF THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY'S HAD A LONG. STANDING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY THEY ARE RESTRICTING LICENSES AND IN THE COUNTY SO THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL LICENSE WILD HOLDER CAN ONLY HOLD. FOR LICENSES TOLD ALL ACROSS ALL SECTORS SO THAT'S A WAY THEY ARE. GETTING AT THAT OUTSIDE INVESTMENT ON A IN THEIR COMMUNITY. JUST ANOTHER QUICK EXAMPLE IN MONTEREY COUNTY. THEY. HAVE EXPERIENCE REGULATING THEM THE MEDICINAL MARKET AND THIS REALLY CAME FROM. MICRO ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY. OF COURSE THIS IS JUST ON THE REGULATORY SIDE SO THERE ARE CURRENTLY FORTY ONE COUNTIES OUT THERE THAT CURRENTLY HAVE SOME TYPE OF BAND OR MORATORIUM IN PLACE BUT I WOULD KNOW THAT I THINK ABOUT TEN OF THESE COUNTIES ARE ACTIVELY WORKING IN EARNEST TO. DEVELOP. THEIR ORDINANCE AND OR PUT. TAX MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. INCOME THIS INCLUDES LOS ANGELES COUNTY. LOS ANGELES LIKE MANY OTHERS HAVE SPENT. A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME DOING PUBLIC OUTREACH. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUE THEY'VE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF ON PERMANENT AND I'M LICENSE ACTIVITIES. AS WELL BUT ON THE RETAIL SIDE I THINK THERE US USE OF CIOS OFFICE ARE REPORTED AT ONE POINT THAT THERE WERE SEVENTEEN. HUNDRED ON LICENSE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS COUNTY WIDE HUNDRED OF THOSE WERE IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA SO THEY WANTED TO TAKE THEIR TIME TO REALLY HEAR FROM RESIDENTS WHAT TYPE OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY. THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE WITHIN THE JURISDICTION I THINK THEY HOLD ABOUT THIRTY PUBLIC. FORUMS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND AS A RESULT OF THAT THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH A PHASED IN APPROACH THAT LIMITS LICENSES PER SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICTS BASED ON POPULATION. SO AGAIN IT'S A WAY OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS REALLY DESIGNING A PROGRAM THAT RESPECTS THE NEEDS IN THE WELL I OF THEIR COMMUNITY. AND THEN JUST QUICKLY BEFORE TURN OVER MY COLLEAGUES I I DID WANT TO MENTION. THAT TALKS ABOUT MEASURES THERE ARE CURRENTLY NINE COUNTY TAX MEASURES THAT HAVE PASSED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR OF COURSE. NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED YEAH A COUPLE OF THOSE. COUNTIES ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING. THERE WERE NONE SAYS BUT THEY WERE. A LITTLE BIT FORWARD THINKING AND PUTTING SOMETHING ON THE BALLOT UM C. SOCKETS TRACKING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION. THAT'S AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE WE ARE ALSO ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. AMONGST COUNTIES TO DEVELOP AND MANAGE A DATABASE THAT WOULD CONSOLIDATE ALL OF THE REGULATORY TAX INFORMATION INTO ONE CENTRAL LOCATION TO HELP. ENSURE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE OF LOCAL LICENSEES AND GET TO THAT. ENFORCEMENT ISSUE AYE THERE ARE NOT A LOT OF DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR THE STAY AS WAS NOTED EARLIER OFFER OUR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. SO HAVING TARGETED REAL TIME INFORMATION TECH HELP WITH THE SPEED OF COMPLIANCE NOT HAVING TO CALL THROUGH A LOT OF DATA ASSOCIATE TRUCKING TRACE BUT KNOWING WHAT TO LOOK FOR. WITH SOME ANALYTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DATABASE I THINK WILL HURT ME VERY IMPORTANT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE WOULD CHECKUP BE OVERTURE LOW TIM TWENTY RELIEF STILL COMPANIES APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU GENERALLY MANY CITIES ARE NOW MOVING AHEAD WITH CRAFTING ORDINANCES IN ERECTING LOCAL REGULATORY STRUCTURES. CITY COUNCIL IN THIS SUPPORT STAFF OR CLIMBING LEARNING CURVE AS FAST AS THEY CAN. WITH THE HELP OF A. COMPANY SUCH AS HDL AND OTHERS TO ENACT REASONABLE AND EFFECTIVE REGULATIONS. FOR MANY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES ARE GRASPING THE FULL RANGE OF THE CHANGES THE LAW IN THIS AREA. AND TRYING TO SET APPROPRIATE TAX RATES. THE CURRENT ROADS WE HIGH STATE TAX RATE MAKES THE LETTER TASK PROBLEMATIC AT BEST. FOR OVER A YEAR NOW THE LEAGUE IS MAINTAINED ON BEHALF OF ITS MEMBERS THAT THE CUMULATIVE CURRENT TEACH STATE TAX RATE OF TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. TOO HIGH AND MUST BE LOWERED THIS IS BASED ON THE FIFTEEN PERCENT STATE EXCISE TAX COMBINED WITH THE CULTIVATION TAX WHICH IS EQUIVALENT. TO AN ADDITIONAL TEN PERCENT. THIS TAX MUST BE LOWERED FOR THREE KEY REASONS. FIRST THE CUMULATIVE TAX RATE ONCE LOCAL TAXES ARE FACTORED IN AND ADDED TO THE TOTAL VARIES DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION BETWEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND FIFTY PERCENT RATE THAT IS CERTAIN TO STIMULATE BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY. THE LEAGUE IS ISSUED WARNINGS ABOUT THIS SINCE JANUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THESE FIGURES ARE BASED ON THE BRADLEY BURNS LOCAL TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAXES BUT AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDED. IN ANY CONSUMER PURGES ANYWHERE IN THE STATE COMBINED WITH NO ORDINANCES IN VARIOUS CITIES ENACTED SINCE NOVEMBER FIRST OF LAST YEAR. THEIR STATUS DE SALES OR OTHER LOCAL TAX ON CANNABIS AT A RATE OF ANYWHERE. FROM FIVE TO A HIGH OF TWENTY PERCENT. THE SECOND WHATEVER THE INTENT DEFECTIVE THAT HIGH TAX RATES WILL BE TO CROWD LOCAL TAXES OUT. NONE THE LESS MANY CITIES ARE PROCEEDING TO ENACT LOCAL CANNABIS TAXES RANGING FROM ANYWHERE. FROM SEVEN TO TEN PERCENT ON AVERAGE DESPITE WARNINGS FROM THE LEAK THAT THIS RATE MAY BE TOO HIGH. THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF THE CURRENT STATE TAX POLICY IN THIS AREA MAY BE A SHORT LIST CONSISTING SOLELY OF THE CARTEL. THIS EFFECTIVELY LIMITS LOCAL TAXES TO FOR. TO SIX PERCENT WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING A WITH LIMITED SUCCESS. THIRD THIS IS A NEW INDUSTRY AND AND SHOULD NOT BE OVER BURDENED WITH HIGH TAXES DIRECTLY OUT OF THE GATE. THE MOMENT THAT THE REGULATORY STRUCTURE IS LOST ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT UNLIKE OTHER BUSINESSES. THERE ARE A BROAD RANGE OF TAX DEDUCTIONS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER THAT CANNABIS OPERATORS ARE PRECLUDED BY LAW FROM PROCLAIMING. THE THEREFORE MUST INCUR HIGHER THAN NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES STATE TAX POLICY AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM SHOULD REFLECT THAT. WE'RE AWARE OF LEGISLATIVE BALLOT MEASURE RELEASED A PROPOSAL. TO LOWER THE TAX RATE TO FIVE PERCENT TO PLEASE THAT MEASURE ON THE FUTURE BALLOT SINCE THE CURRENT TAX RATE WAS SET BY PROPOSITION FIFTY FOUR SIXTY FOUR. THE TECH SHOULD BE LOWERED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE DEBATED. BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH THE MORE IMPORTANT CHANGE IS MISSING FROM THE PROPOSAL ALL FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS IN THE TAX RATE SHOULD BE HANDED OVER TO THE LEGISLATURE. WHY? CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE SITTING TAX POLICY WE HAVE THE INITIATIVE PROCESS NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHTS PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. IS ELOQUENT EVIDENCE OF THE FAR REACHING DAMAGE THAT CAN BE DONE USING THIS MECHANISM GOING FORWARD BOTH STATE AND CITIES NEED A NIMBLE PROCESS FOR ADJUSTING THE CAT. GUT CANNABIS TAX RATE THAT IS MORE DIRECTLY RESPONSIVE TO MARKET CONDITIONS WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THAT ANY CHANGE IN THIS ARENA INCLUDE A PROVISION ASSIGNING THE LEGISLATURE THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE TAX RATE. EVEN OF THE TAX RATE IS NOT IMMEDIATELY LOWERED A PROVISION THE SIGNING THE LEGISLATURE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE. THE SECOND TRACK INTEREST REQUIREMENTS. BUT I MAY BEING. A A PROBLEM THAT THE STATE'S STRICKEN FACE PROBLEMS A SYSTEM IS NOT YET FULLY OPERATIONAL SINCE THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS STATED CLEARLY THAT IT'S REQUIREMENTS. DO NOT GET APPLY. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE THE STATE GET UP AND RUNNING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS ONE THERE ARE NEGATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS. ABOUT THE LACK OF ABILITY TO TRACK AN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT THAT IS ALSO. THE PRODUCT WILL PSYCHOTROPIC PROPERTIES THROUGH THE STREAM OF COMMERCE SINCE THERE IS NOW NO WAY TO KNOW THEIR PRODUCT BEEN TAMPERED WITH. THIS IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TERMS OF STATE LABELING STANDARDS. SECOND LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCERNED LEAGUE SHARES AND IN VERSION OF THE PRODUCT HAVE NO HOPE OF BEING ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED SO LONG AS TRACK INTERESTS IS NOT OPERATIONAL. THIRD IT WILL BE MANY MONTHS AFTER IT IS OPERATIONAL THAT IT WILL ACTUALLY BECOME ENFORCEABLE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS A PROVISION IN THE REGULATIONS ALLOWING CAMERAS OPERATORS AN EXEMPTION FROM COMPLYING TO TREK ENTRIES FOR ANY PRODUCT THEY HAD ON HAND PRIOR TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN. NO MANY OPERATORS RESPONDED TO THIS BY STOCKING UP ON PRODUCT PRIOR TO THE END OF LAST YEAR. WHICH WAS THERE LEGAL LIKE TO DO AND A NUMBER OF THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES FOR SALE. ON HAND AT THIS TIME. THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO TRACK AND TRACE. FOURTH NO TRACKING UNTIL THE FOLLOWING STAGE. HEIGHTENS ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND REGULATORS CONCERNS ABOUT DIVERSION. ONCE PLANTS REACH EIGHT INCHES THEY SHOULD BE TAG REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE FLOWING BECAUSE EXPERIENCE IN COLORADO INDICATES THEY WILL SURVIVE WHAT'S THE READ EIGHT INCHES. IN ANY CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND THEY CAN BE SOLD ON THE BLACK MARKET IN THE MEANTIME. THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WE NEED TO LOOK AT VOLUME IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE MARKET DEMAND AND I JUST PRODUCTION ACCORDINGLY. OTHERWISE IT WILL TRIGGER FEDERAL CONCERNS THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL REGULATORY STRUCTURE. ON TESTING REQUIREMENTS WE WOULD URGE THE STATE'S TESTING REQUIREMENTS. BE BROUGHT ONLINE AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE BECAUSE THE TESTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR ENFORCING THE STATE'S HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. THERE'S AN ONGOING POTENTIAL THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH SO LONG AS THEY'RE NOT BEING ENFORCED. ANOTHER PROBLEM CITIES ARE RUNNING INTO IN TRYING TO PSYCH THESE FACILITIES PARTICULARLY RETAIL OUTLETS IS THE DEFINITION OF YOUTH CENTERS. CURRENTLY IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE CURRENT LAW PROHIBITS LUCCHINI CANADA'S BUSINESS WITHIN SIX HUNDRED FEET OF AN EXISTING SCHOOL DAYCARE CENTER OR USE THAT. BUT THE LETTER TERM YOU CENTER HAS BEEN THE CAUSE OF SOME CONCERN AND CONFUSION FOR CITIES INCITING CANNABIS BUSINESS BECAUSE IT IS NOT YET SPECIFICALLY DEFINED. WITH ENOUGH SPECIFICITY TO KNOW WHAT CONSTITUTES A YOUTH CENTER WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO PLEASE A DETAILED DEFINITION OF YOU SOONER INSTEAD YOU TO SOON AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITH MEANINGFUL GUIDANCE ON THIS POINT. FIFTH YOU LIKE TO RESTATE Y. CULTIVATION LIMIT CARLY STATE REGULATIONS INCLUDE NO CULTIVATION LIMIT WHATSOEVER. AS A DOCTOR WOULD NOTED EARLY. THE ONE ACRE LIMITATION IS BEEN REPEALED AND OPERATORS ARE CIRCUMVENTING THE RULING ITS LARGE SCALE CULTIVATION BY APPLYING FOR MULTIPLE TYPE ONE INTO LICENSES. SINCE THERE IS NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER THEY CAN APPLY FOR THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE STEEP COULD PROACTIVELY ADDRESS FEDERAL CONCERNS AND MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE FEDERAL INTERVENTION. BY IMPOSING A REASONABLE CULTIVATION LIMIT THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR. FINALLY WITH REGARD TO ADVERTISING. TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS SUCH AS NGUYEN BABS AND OTHERS ARE ACCEPTING ADVERTISING FROM BUSINESSES AND HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THAT YOU NOT HAVE A STATE LICENSE NUMBER. THIS IS A CONCERN FOR CITIES IN REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE MANY OF THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WILL FALL ON LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE IS A NEED FOR THE STATE TO DEVISE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM ENSURING THAT. ANY ENTITY ACCEPTING ADS FROM CANNABIS BUSINESSES CAN ONLY ACCEPT AS THAT INCLUDE A STATE LICENSE NUMBER. BIG CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS. MEETS AND SUCCESSFUL IN ROADS IN THIS AREA WITH REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT AGAINST A. BED AND BREAKFAST BY REQUIRING A MUNICIPAL PERMIT NUMBER ON ALL AT. WITH THAT I WILL CLOSE TURN OVER MISTER FELDMAN BE HAPPY IT'S REQUEST. CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME JONATHAN FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. SO BRIEFLY GO OVER SORT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THE LANDSCAPE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT YOU KNOW ABOUT. TWO MONTHS INTO THIS WHOLE PROCESS SO I CAN'T TELL YOU EVERYTHING THAT'S WORKING AND EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT WORKING WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHERE THERE ARE GAPS. INFILL THOSE IN AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. BUT I'LL GIVE YOU DELAY LAND SO DOES MY TWO COLLEAGUES SPOKE BEFORE THE LOCALS ARE STILL DEVELOPING THE ORDINANCES WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH OUR POLICE CHIEFS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IS BEEN EFFECTIVE IN CERTAIN AREAS. AND LESS EFFECTIVE THAN OTHERS IS TERMS OF. ACTUALLY WITH THE MEAT OF THE ORDINANCE WHAT GOES IN THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS TAX STRUCTURES SECURITY REQUIREMENTS. BUT IMPORTANT NOTE AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS ALL REALIZE THAT THIS IS HAPPENING BUT THERE ARE INDUSTRIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT ARE PUTTING BALLOT INITIATIVES. ON. LOCAL GOVERNMENT BALLOTS I ESSENTIALLY WRITING THEIR OWN RULES YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S A CITY WITH THE BAND AND THEY DON'T WANT THE BAND THEY WANT OPERATE BUSINESSES THERE THEY ARE FUNDING LOCAL BALLOT INITIATIVES. I AND IT DOESN'T TAKE MUCH OF THE LOCAL LEVEL TO REALLY PUTS. SOME OF THAT IT'S GONNA CHALLENGE LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT AS WELL. I KNOW. MY COLLEAGUE FROM A COUNTIES TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT COUNTIES ARE PUTTING CAPS ON HOW MANY LICENSEES THEY CAN GIVE TO ONE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL. AND THAT SORT OF GET SAID A SUMMER WOODS. STATEMENT ABOUT THE TOTAL ACREAGE CAPS BECAUSE LOCALS CAN DO THAT BUT I CAN'T DO IT IF THEY'RE FIGHTING A LOCAL BALLOT INITIATIVE BY AN INDUSTRY THAT'S RIGHT IN THEIR OWN RULES. SO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE KINDA SETTING SOME FLOOR. IS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THE CONTEXT OF THAT HAPPENING. SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS LOCAL LEVELS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING WITH OUR STATE. LICENSING AGENCIES WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW ENFORCEMENT. IS GONNA BE HANDLED. STATEWIDE. HOW WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION AND COLLABORATE IT'S REALLY GONNA BE A PARTNERSHIP? IT'S GONNA MAKE THAT EFFECTIVE AND SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING A SERIES MEANS WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT. TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. SO I ALSO WANT THINK ALL THIS THE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE STATE AGENCIES THAT WERE UP HERE EARLIER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS SO FAR AND WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE IN THAT. DOWN THE ROAD. SO REALLY QUICKLY IT KINDA TOP ISSUES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT GETTING INTO THE. BROADER BY. SUBJECT MATTER. DRUG DRIVING IS STILL DEFINITELY ONE OF THE TOP ONE CENTER WE HAD CHP APPEAR EARLIER TALK ABOUT. DR RETRAINING AND. THE FUNDS THAT THEY'VE HAD TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DE AREA EXPERTS THAT ARE OUT THERE ON THE FIELD ACTUALLY. DURING ROADSIDE TESTING. YOU KNOW AGAIN AS WAS MENTIONED IT'S NOT A PANACEA THAT'S NOT YOU THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA TRAIN ENOUGH DO YOU ARE USE TO MANAGE ALL THE TRAFFIC STOPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU NOTHING I SAW STATISTICS CHP MADE FOUR MILLION TRAFFIC STOPS. IN ONE YEAR RECENTLY AND THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH DE AREAS TO GO AND RESPOND EACH ONE OF THOSE SO WELL THAT'S GREAT AND WE NEED TO KEEP GETTING THAT TRAINING OUT THERE. NO NO ONE SHOULD BE UNDER ANY FALSE PRETENSES THAT'S GOING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU KNOW ESTABLISHING A PER SE STANDARD. DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRMENT AND I GET THE ARGUMENTS BETWEEN. THE PRESENCE OF A DRUG AND IT ACTUALLY AND I INDICATING IMPAIRMENT AND WE STILL NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT THAT IS. BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S GONNA TAKE A LAW CHANGE THAT'S THAT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THIS BODY IN THE SENATE. TO COME FOR WITH THE SOLUTION TO THAT AND IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING OTHER STATES IT'S CLEARLY BEEN A PROBLEM. DO YOU IDEAS BEEN ON THE RISE WE LOOK EIGHT YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRACKING UNFORTUNATELY DON'T TRACK A. CANNABIS DO YOU ID AS A SEPARATE STATISTICS SO IT'S HARD FOR US TO KNOW EXACTLY. WHAT'S INCREASED AND WHAT'S HOT WHAT HASN'T OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT SOME THAT WERE ALSO TRYING TO WORK ON. BUT YOU KNOW IT'S THAT SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS SAYING YOU KNOW A MINOR. SOMEONE UNDER THE AGE AS THEIR ZERO TOLERANCE THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE FOR ALCOHOL RIGHT NOW IT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO AT LEAST THE SAME. FOR CANNABIS. I YOU KNOW WHAT. COURSE FOR THE CARVE OUT THAT THERE ARE MINORS WHO HAVE MEDICINE ALL. CARDS FOR USE BUT. THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING RESEMBLING MAKES A STRONG STATEMENT THAT. YOU KNOW WE TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY. YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE'S ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT IMPAIRED CANNABIS DRIVING LOOKS LIKE. BUT SURELY THERE'S A POINT WHERE IT'S GONE TOO FAR AND IT'S UNSAFE. YOU KNOW WE WE CAN ARGUE WHERE THAT LINE IS BUT SURELY THERE'S A POINT WHERE IT'S GOING TO SAVE TO FOREIGN IT'S UNSAFE WE HAVE TO START. BE MORE FORWARD ABOUT THAT. I. BECAUSE THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION IS IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT'S FINE AS THEY CAN TO A SECOND POINT. YOUTH ACCESS. YOU KNOW THERE THE PERCEPTION MY TALK TO SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS WHO ON CAMPUSES HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES EVERYDAY IN A SEA THIS USE NAY THEY TALK TO KIDS ABOUT THIS. FEEDBACK I GET FROM THEM OF THE KIDS ARE TELLING THEM THAT'S FINE AS MEDICINAL. THAT THERE'S NO NO HEALTH IMPACTS TO THEM. IT SO AS WE START YOU KNOW WORKING ON PUBLIC CAMPAIGNS TO REALLY EDUCATE. OUR ARE KIDS EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT DRIVING SAFETY. REGARDING THIS. CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS. AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO START BEING MORE FORWARD ABOUT IT. AND BUILD UPON THE GREAT WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE BUT IT'S IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE AND IT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS SUCH. DIVERSION AN INVERSION IN A DIVERSION LEGAL PRODUCT LEAVING THE LEGAL MARKET INVERSION ILLEGAL PRODUCTS COMING INTO THE LEGAL MARKET. STILL HUGE 䉉UE MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT% OF. CAMPUS GROWN IN THE STATE PRISON AMOUNT CONSUMED KNOW THERE'S CLEARLY A GAP THERE AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THAT PRODUCT. LOT OF ITS. BEING SHIPPED TO THE EAST COAST CROSSING STATE LINES AND THAT'S GONNA BE A MAJOR FOCUS ON. OUR PART TO IDENTIFY WHERE THAT'S HAPPENING AND SHUT DOWN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. PARTNERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL AT THE LOW A LOCAL LEVEL AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MULTI JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES HERE. YOU KNOW THE TRACK AND TRACE SYSTEM. IDENTIFYING YOU KNOW BAD ACTORS THAT IT'S REALLY GONNA COME DOWN TO HOW WELL. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE STATE LICENSING AGENCIES SHARE INFORMATION HOW QUICKLY IT IS I KNOW WE'VE GOT A HOT LINE UP NOW THAT'S HELPFUL WE'VE GOT AN EMAIL. THAT'S HELPFUL. THIS THIS PARTNERSHIP THOSE IN ORDER TO REALLY. BE COMPREHENSIVE ENOUGH TO MANAGE IN A TIRE EVEN INDUSTRY FOR THE STATE'S. SIZE CALIFORNIA'S GONNA HAVE TO BE BETTER THAN JUST A HOTLINE IN THE EMAIL. YOU KNOW WE'RE TAKING STEPS TOWARDS DEVELOPING THOSE. COMMUNICATION CHANNELS NOW. WILL. CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT THAT'S GONNA BE CRITICAL. THE SAME THING WITH BLACK MARKET YOU KNOW. STILL THERE. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE ANYTIME SOON BUT IF WE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE LEGAL MARKET TO THRIVE. THAT COMES AT US ENFORCING OUR LAWS AGAINST A BLACK MARKET IS AS STRINGENTLY AS WE CAN. THAT. ENFORCING THAT TAKES RESOURCES. SO. LOOKING AT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO ABOUT THE BLACK MARKET HOW DO WE INCREASE. ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY GOING AFTER THOSE THOSE BAD ACTORS THOSE THAT WOULD UNDERCUT THE LEGAL. FRAMEWORK THAT WE'VE ALL TAKEN SO LONG TO BUILD AND ESTABLISH. RESOURCES IS GOING TO BE KEY AND AGAIN NO ONE SHOULD BE ANY UNDER ANY FALSE PRETENSE THAT THE FUNDING IMPROPER SIXTY FOUR SUFFICIENT. DUDE DID HANDLE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THAT AREA. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME ENFORCEMENT GRANTS THAT WILL BE EL OF ELIGIBLE FOOD BE SEC BUT THOSE ARE ONLY ELIGIBLE TO A. LOCALITIES THAT ALLOW FOR CULTIVATION AND RETAIL LICENSES SO VIEW OF A BAND REVIEW OF A MORATORIUM OR YOU DON'T ALLOW RE TELL YOU NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE GRANTS. SO IF THERE'S AN IT IS AN AREA WHERE THERE'S THERE'S CONCENTRATED BLACK MARKET OPERATIONS BUT THEY DECIDED A LOCAL LEVEL THEY WANT RETAIL THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET THE ENFORCEMENT GRANTS. FROM THE STATE IS GONNA HAVE TO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IF YOU GUYS WANNA GET SERIOUS ABOUT GOING AFTER THOSE OPERATIONS. SO SORT OF ARE KEY ISSUES. SO ADD AS AN ASSOCIATION WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. THE WE HAVE A MARIJUANA SUBCOMMITTEE THAT IS REVIEWING. BILLS REGULATIONS TOPICS OF DISCUSSION. PUTTING TOGETHER INFORMATION FOR OUR ASSOCIATION HAND OUT GREEN INFORMATION FOR YOU AND I GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM DIFFERENT OFFICES ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THIS BILL IS THAT REGULATION ALREADY BY THEM AND. I'M IT'S BEEN HELPFUL TO HAVE A GUY. GROUP OF POLICE CHIEF SEND A. ONE CAPTAIN. IS FANTASTIC. BE ABLE TO KIND OF REALLY BECOME THE EXPERTS FROM OUR ASSOCIATION STANDPOINT ON THAT ISSUE. I'VE ALSO SENT OUT JUST LAST WEEK IN ENFORCEMENT SURVEY TO EACH ONE OF OUR MEMBERS ALL THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO POLICE CHIEFS TO FILL OUT I HOPE I GET MOST OF THEM BACK. ASKING THEM BROUGHT ABOUT FIFTY QUESTIONS IS PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE ABOUT A. ORDINANCE WHAT'S ENFORCEMENT LOOK LIKE RIGHT NOW WHERE THEY NEED HELP? WHAT QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS ARE THEY HAVING RIGHT NOW? ALRIGHT SO I HOPE TO GET THAT FEEDBACK. BACK SOON AND SHARE WITH EVERYONE SO WE CAN KIND OF START DEVELOPING MAYBE A STRATEGY BASED OFF OF THAT YOU KNOW I WANTED TO WAIT UNTIL AT LEAST. FEW MONTHS IN. DESCENDED OUT SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE THERE WAS SOME EXPERIENCES TO SHARE WITH US I'M SORRY IT WAS ALREADY A FREE FEEDBACK TODAY BUT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU GUYS IS THAT GETS. FINALIZED. AND TRAINING CLASSES PANEL DISCUSSIONS WERE ALWAYS TRYING WE HAVE OUR ANNUAL CONFERENCE COMING UP IN MARCH AND I'VE ALREADY ASKED IF YOU THE STATE AGENCIES TO PRESENT ON A PANEL. TO ALL OF OUR POLICE CHIEFS TO HELP BILL THAT DIALOGUE IN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S THAT'S JUST GONNA BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FORSMAN STATEWIDE. SO LAST. YOU KNOW THAT WE ARE TO TALK ABOUT THE RECEPTION OF THE CALL MEMO AND DOJ HAD A. GOOD TAKE ON IT AS WELL JUST TO. PUT THIS OUT THERE FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WHEN THAT WAS. I DON'T. THEY WERE CYNICAL MEMO. STATEMENT AND WE MADE WAS THAT PUBLIC SAFETY WILL STILL BE OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN. THAT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR US WERE STILL GOING AFTER THOSE THAT ARE POSING A RISK EITHER THE PUBLIC TO JUVENILES. DIVERSION BLACK MARKET OPERATIONS CARTEL. I JUST KNOW THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LICENSE. YOU'LL BE PROTECTED I MEAN IF YOUR LICENSE BUT YEAR YEAR DIVERTING PRODUCT OR YOU'RE ALLOWING YOU TO HAVE ACCESS YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S NO REASON THAT WE SHOULD. WITHOUT ANY RESOURCES FROM GOING AFTER YOU FOR THAT CONNECTIVITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT I'M DONE. PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IF I COLLEAGUES COULD TO BE CONCISE IN YOUR QUESTION SPACE AND WE SOMEONE ADDITIONAL PANEL PLUS ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT. SO I SAW ON MR LACKEY AND THEN MISTER GALLAGHER AND. HE'LL BE QUICKLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. ANNA I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ASSIST MISTER FELDMAN. AND WHAT CHALLENGES ARE THE FOR LOCAL ENFORCEMENT DOING. THE ILLEGAL ENFORCER WE HEARD FROM THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE'S A PRETTY HEAVY RELIANCE A LOCAL ON FORCE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT RELIANCE. I MEAN DIFFERENT RESOURCES I MEAN WE'RE STILL. OPERATING ON ON THIN BUDGETS. AGAIN WITH A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES THEN YOU THROW THIS ON TOP OF IT YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME AREAS WHERE THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE SOME OF THE LOCAL TAXES AND AND BUILD A. STRONG MARIJUANA ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS. WITHIN THEIR RANKS BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA BE DONE EVERYWHERE SUDDENLY POSSIBLE EVERYWHERE. SO. YOU KNOW. I THINK ANOTHER IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THAT WE LOOK AT. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING WIDE THAT WE DON'T SEPARATE IT AND PUT IT SOLELY INTO THE HANDS OF ONE STATE AGENCY OR SOUL INTO THE HANDS OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE A PARTNERSHIP? SO THAT. YOU KNOW I. THE RESOURCES WHEN THEY'RE THERE THEY CAN BE USED EFFECTIVELY. SOME I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM TOO IS. IS THE FACT THAT. SO MAYES INVESTIGATIONS ARE QUITE COMPLEX. AND REQUIRED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND AND COOPERATION PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER AGENCIES. MY FINAL QUESTION WOULD BE. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT RURAL AREAS HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE. ILLEGAL CULTIVATION ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC LANDS A CLEAN UP THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE BECAUSE. AND I'LL PUT UP OVER HERE TOWARD YOU FOLKS. CAMERAS LET ME HAVE A C. SACK AND. ILLEGAL GROWS ON PUBLIC LANDS HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT. AND TROUBLESOME ISSUE AND IT'S REALLY. IT'S A RESOURCES QUESTION BUT IT'S ALSO. DE. WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND OUR STATE PARTNERS FOR THAT MATTER AND IT'S REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE REGULATED SPACE AYE AYE WE. STRIVE TO WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO DEAL WITH THE BLACK MARKET ISSUE. AS WE CAN BOLSTER THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN SOME INSTANCES THERE'S THERE'S WAIT OVER BY A FOR THE MOST PART ESPECIALLY I OUT IN THE NATIONAL FORESTS IN OTHER. AREAS. THEIR TWO VERY SEPARATE ISSUES AND WE NEED ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET IN CALIFORNIA WITH REGULATING AGAINST THOSE. THOSE ILLEGAL GROWS. CITIES DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES BY AND LARGE TO ENGAGE IN ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT AND IT'S A GOING FORWARD THAT CAN BE A MAJOR PROBLEM ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE. THE THEY'RE ALL VERY EAGER TO BECAUSE HE'S ON THE SEQUEL EXEMPTION SO LONG AS IT IS A DISCRETIONARY PROCESS A LOT OF THEM ARE VERY RELIEVED WHEN THEY HEAR THAT. IN THE BRIEFINGS THAT WE'VE GIVEN IN VARIOUS CITIES AROUND THE STATE. ANOTHER ISSUE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE IS THE FACT THAT. ACCORDING TO THE RESPONSE. REGULATIONS PUT UP BY THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THE. MUNICIPAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT CENTERS ARE GOING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OF FOR WASTE FROM CULTIVATION WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS SO THERE'S A. A BIT OF CONCERN BORDERING ON PANIC IN SOME JURISDICTIONS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE AS A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CAPACITY. THOSE. THOSE TREATMENTS ARE IS GONNA HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THE FOR THE MEDICAL DELETION RUNOFF. OR SEWAGE AND THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT SKILL OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BUT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DISCONTENT AND HOW MANY. OF US SINNERS HOW MANY CULTIVATION OPERATIONS OR LICENSE WITHIN CITY LIMITS ETCETERA SO IT'S IT'S A VERY UNCERTAIN. TROUBLING QUESTION. FOR CITY. OLYMPIC ADJOURNMENT. KIND OF ALONG THE SAME. LINES. YOU KNOW WE ARE. IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES THERE'S DIFFERENT LOCAL LAND USE POLICIES PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO. YOU KNOW IN EACH COUNTY AND. AND SAY DECIDE HOW TO DEAL WITH HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REGULATE. MARIJUANA BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST NOT. REFUSING TO COMPLY. WITH LOCAL LE LAND USE OR LOCAL ORDINANCES. WHO CAN YOU KNOW BECAUSE WHICH I THINK WE JUST IDENTIFIED THERE'S? NO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS NOT ALLOWED RESOURCES ALREADY SPREAD REALLY THIN. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WHO CAN LOCALS CALL ON AT THE STATE LEVEL TO HELP. FIND IN. WITH ENFORCEMENT ON ILLEGAL. GROWS. I DEFINITELY THINK IT'S A PARTNER ENFORCEMENT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE AGENCIES WE HAVE A DUAL LICENSING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA SO. WE NEED TO BE COMMUNICATING WITH ONE ANOTHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ON WITHIN THE STATE REGULATORY. AGENCIES IN ADDITION TO. THE STATE AND LOCAL ENFORCEMENT I DO THINK THAT THERE'S A ROLE FOR THE INDUSTRY TO PLAY AS WERE ASKING FOLKS TO COME OUT OF THE GRAY AND BLACK MARKET PLACE AND ENGAGE IN. QUITE COMPLEX REGULATORY SCHEME. THERE ARE ACTORS GOOD ACTORS THAT ARE DOING SO AND OTHERS THEY'RE UNDERCUTTING THEM BY NOT FOLLOWING. IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS AND I DO THINK. THAT THERE WILL BE A PARTNERSHIP THAT NEEDS TO BE ESTABLISHED BETWEEN. THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AND THE COMPLIANT INDUSTRY TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHO IS NOT COMPLIANCE SO THAT WE CAN GET THEM INTO THE REGULATED SPACE. NO I WOULD ECHO MS MARTIN'S COMMENTED TO THE QUESTION OF LOCALS TRADED. CIRCLE THE WAGONS THAT PUT TOGETHER AS BEST THEY CAN A SEAMLESS WEB OF ENFORCEMENT. OF COURSE IN THE MORE EGREGIOUS CASES IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO CALL ON THE THE THE CULT WE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE OR POSSIBLY. A HIGHWAY PATROL BUT WERE VERY CLEAR THAT ENFORCEMENT FROM REALLY GONNA BE ON US. AND SO WHERE YOU. LOCALS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF COMING UP WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO HELP ADDRESS THAT. WE JUST ME REALLY QUICKLY LISTING OFF SOME OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS A KICK ON I GUESS THE BUREAU WOULD BE WINE AND THEN.% WHO ARE SOME THE OTHER STATE ENTITIES LIKE IT BECAUSE I THINK YOU MENTION CHP? DEPARTMENT. FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I THINK WITH RESPECT TO CULTIVATION. CFA AS OUR PRIMARY WAY AND ARE AG COMMISSIONERS AND OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN. THE REGULATION OF TRADITIONAL AGRICULTURE. BY AND WE'RE DEALING WITH ILLEGAL GROWS THAT MIGHT BE OUT IN THE NATIONAL OUR STATE FORESTS I DO THINK WE NEED TO. WORK WITH OUR GAME WARDENS. OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS AND OTHERS AND GET CREATIVE ABOUT HOW WE AND IT'S NOT EVEN UNTIL THE GLAND AND I MEAN THAT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE ISSUE BUT NOW IT'S LIKE. IT'S. ME ON PRIVATE YEAH I AM BUT THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH THE ORDINANCES IS THE PROBLEM YEAH. OKAY THANK YOU. SO GIPSON UP PASS FOR THE INTERESTS OF TIME OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT OF PANELISTS HERE I WOULDN'T THEN QUICKLY ROLL INTO THE THIRD PANEL WHICH WILL FOCUS ON. OF INDUSTRY IN THE LICENSE MARKETPLACE AND THE VALUE WAITING HOW EARLY EFFORTS AT REGULATION HAVE BEEN IMPACTING LEGAL. BUSINESS. TO ASSIST WITH THESE EFFORTS WE HAVE THREE LICENSEES OUR FIRST OFF WE HAVE OUR THACKER CEO OF KHALIFA. THAN WE HAVE CASEY O'NEILL CO OWNER OF HAPPY DAY FARMS. AND THEN KENNY MORRISON CEO OF THE CC BRANDS AGAIN OF THIS IS THAT OF THE INDUSTRIES HAVE WHO KINDLY A CALL THE THREE OF YOU UP. A TO THE PANEL AND WILL. YOU CAN BE BRIEF IN YOUR REMARKS THAT WE CAN HAVE ROBUST DIALOGUE IF YOU HAVE AN INTEREST IN ADDRESSING ANY OF THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. OF PREVIOUS PANELS FEEL FREE TO DO SO. AND SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH YOU. MISTER THACKER. GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS LARRY THACKER AND I'M THE CEO OF KHALIFA BASED IN SAN JOSE. ONE OF THE LARGEST VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CANNABIS OPERATIONS IN THE STATE. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THE CURRENT STATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL CANNABIS LAWS. FIRST LET ME EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE HARD WORK AND PREPARATION BY ALL THREE REGULATORY AGENCIES. WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN A TRAIN WRECK OF HORRIFIC PROPORTIONS? HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SMOOTH SAILING. THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL. BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND IN THE FEW MINUTES I HAVE TODAY. I WILL FOCUS ON THREE OF THOSE. FIRST AND MOST PROBLEMATIC IS THE BUREAU'S DECISION TO INTERPRET THE STATUE IN A WAY. THAT CREATES AN IMPERMEABLE FIREWALL BETWEEN ADULT USE AND MEDICAL USE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THEIR INTERPRETATION IS SUPPORTED BY THE UNDERLYING STATUTE BUT IN ANY CASE. THE REGULATION ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE COR OF CANNABIS OPERATIONS. THE REGULATION REQUIRES THAT A CANNABIS PLANT IN ITS INFANCY. MUST BE DESIGNATED TO FOLLOW AN ADULT USE PATHWAY OR A MEDICAL USE PATHWAY. FROM THAT POINT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE PLANT TO MOVE FROM ONE PATH TO THE OTHER. EVEN IF IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MARKET DEMANDS FOR THAT PLAN ARE CONTRARY TO THE PLANTS PATHWAY. THE RESULT AS THE MARKET OF BALLS IS INESCAPABLE. THERE WILL BE AGLUT IN ONE OF THE MARKETS IN A SHORTAGE IN THE OTHER. MOST MEDICAL CANNABIS CONSUMERS WILL FIND THAT THE SLIM BENEFITS. TO BEING A MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENT FAR OUTWEIGH. BY THE SIMPLICITY OF BEING AN ADULT USE CONSUMER. THE INDUSTRY WILL FIND FAR GREATER PROFITS ON THE ADULT USE PATHWAY. AND CHOOSE TO DIRECT. ALL OF ITS ALL OR NEARLY ALL OF THEIR PRODUCT TO ADULT USE. THAT WILL LEAVE THOSE CALIFORNIANS WHO REMAIN MEDICAL PATIENTS WITH VERY LIMITED SUPPLY. ANOTHER FACTOR IS INESCAPABLE. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ADULT USE CANNABIS AND IT ADULT USE CANNABIS AND PRODUCTS. AND MEDICAL CANNABIS AND PRODUCTS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. OR IN THE CULTIVATION. AND TO CONTINUE ARGUE THAT THERE IS IS TO PERPETUATE A FICTION. THE REGULATION MUST BE CHANGED IN ORDER TO ALLOW ADULT USE AND MEDICAL USE LICENSES. TO CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH EACH OTHER. SECOND FOR ST NEEDS TO TAKE A CLOSE HARD LOOK IT THE CUMULATIVE. TAX OBLIGATIONS IMPOSED ON THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. I AGREE THAT IS A CANNABIS AND THAT AS CANNABIS COMES INTO THE LIGHT. PAYING ITS FAIR SHARE OF TAXES. STRENGTHENS THE LEGITIMACY. AS US. AS A CALIFORNIA AND HISTORY. THE TAX POLICY CHALLENGES ASSESSING OUT WHAT TIPPING POINT THE CUMULATIVE TAXATION. BECOMES AN UNDUE BURDEN. WITH THE COMBINATION OF THE CULTIVATION TAX. EXCISE TAX SALES TAX. AND LOCAL CANNABIS BUSINESS TAX THE TAX OBLIGATION APPROACH IS FORTY PERCENT IN MANY JURISDICTIONS. AGGRAVATING THAT BURDEN IS THE IRONIC DECISION BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT CANNABIS BUSINESSES MUST STILL PAY FEDERAL TAXES. HOWEVER. UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION TWO EIGHTY E.. A CANNABIS BUSINESS CANNOT DEDUCT THE SAME BUSINESS EXPENSES BUT EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY CAN. SO OUR FEDERAL TAX BURDEN IS MUCH GREATER THAN EVERY OTHER INDUSTRY. IF WE AS A STATE ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPERATED FOR YEARS IN A GRAY MARKET. TO COME FULLY INTO THE LEGAL MARKET. WE MUST BE CAREFUL TO AVOID CUMULATIVE TAX POLICY. THAT WOULD BE VIEWED BY ANY INDUSTRY AS EXCESSIVE. FINALLY. FOR ALL OF ITS SUCCESSES IN DEVELOPING A RATIONAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THE STATE IS NOT ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE INDUSTRY WORKS. A PRIMARY CASE IN POINT IS THE ABSENCE IN THE REGULATION OF ANY DIRECTION OR ALLOWANCE FOR LICENSING TO ENGAGE IN THE MARKETING OF THEIR PRODUCT OTHER BUSINESSES. LIKE MANY INDUSTRIES ENGAGED IN A CONSUMER BASED PRODUCT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MARKET OUR PRODUCT OTHER LICENSEES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY SHARING SAMPLES WITH POTENTIAL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. WHEN OUR SALES REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTATIVES VISIT A POTENTIAL RETAIL VENDOR HERE SHE MUST BE ABLE TO SHOW THE VENDOR THE PRODUCT. A SALES REP IS SELLING AND ALLOW THE VENDOR TO HAVE A SAMPLE OF THE PRODUCT. THE REGULATIONS ARE COMPLETELY SAYA SILENT ON MARKETING FROM LICENSEE TO LICENSE ANY LICENSEE. BUT THERE ARE OTHER REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO GUIDE TO SEE TO SAIL PATH OF THE PRODUCT THAT ON INTENTIONALLY INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY. TO CONDUCT BUSINESS TO BUSINESS MARKETING. WELL WE URGE THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MARKETING SOON. THE STATE ALSO NEEDS TO SPEND TIME WITH THE INDUSTRY ON OTHER DISCRETE ISSUES. WHERE THE REGULATIONS DO NOT MATCH TRADITIONAL OPERATIONAL IMPERATIVES OF ANY OTHER CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY? I HOPE THESE THOUGHTS ARE HELPFUL. WE ALL STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO BEFORE THE REGULATION OF CANNABIS IS IS FREE AS POSSIBLE FROM THESE UNNECESSARY BUMPS IN THE ROAD. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. IF YOU MISTER THACKER MISTER NIELSEN CAN. GOOD MORNING. CHAIR LOW CHAIR WOULD. MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY. MY NAME IS CASEY O'NEILL I COOPERATE HAPPILY FARMS IN MEDICINE ACCOUNTING. SERVICE VICE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA GROWERS ASSOCIATION. I'M A MICRO SCALE VEGETABLE PRODUCER. AND IT CABS FARMER. I WOULD MY FAMILY RUN OF VESSEL SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE TO FARMERS MARKETS EACH WEEK DURING THE SUMMER. LAST YEAR ARE THREE CRAP FARMS WERE. EQUIVALENT TO THREE QUICK. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED SQUARE FOOT COTTAGE LICENSES WE ARE VERY SMALL. TOTAL VEGETABLE CULTIVATION OF JUST OVER AN ACRE. BETWEEN OUR FARMS. I GROWN SO THAT'S DOUBLES MY TOTAL REQUIREMENT IS THAT I GET A THIRTY FIVE DOLLAR PERMIT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE THAT LISTS THE CROPS THAT I WANT TO SELL. COMPARE THAT WITH THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT SMALL CANNABIS FARMS ARE UP AGAINST FOR LAND USE REGULATIONS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS AND IT'S A. IT'S IT'S A LARGE DISPARITY SOMETIMES LOOKING IT OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. WE WE ARE FARMERS IT IS IS OUR CALLING WE LOVE IT THIS IS THIS IS ALL WE'VE EVER WANTED TO DO LAST YEAR MY WIFE AND I AGE MAY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE FARM. WE WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT BECAUSE I OF THE LICENSING AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS EIGHT MOST OF THAT UP. I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND AN OFF FARM JOB TO MAKE ENDS MEET. YOU KNOW I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE THAT THE FACT THAT I HAVE A TEMPORARY STAY LICENSE BUT I CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE MOST OF MY COMMUNITY DOES NOT. I'M HERE TODAY ON YOUR GRAVE CIRCUMSTANCES THE IMPACT OF THESE REGULATIONS ON OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY'S IS DRASTIC. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF JOBS OFTEN JOBS IN OUR COMMUNITY ON A LOT OF PEOPLE I KNOW HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY WOULD DO IF THEY CAN'T GET A LICENSE. AND THEY CAN'T GET A LICENSE. WE ARE IN A CRISIS. THIS EMERGENCY IS CAUSED BY THOUSAND PAPER CUTS NOT BY A SINGLE WOUND. AS SUCH WILL BE ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO CORRECT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY AS IT STANDS TODAY NEARLY ALL OF THE BUSINESSES OPERATING WILL FAIL IN THE NEXT YEAR. IF YOU TAKE ACTION AND REDUCE THESE BARRIERS MORE BUSINESSES WILL SURVIVE. YOU DO NOT WE NEED TO START THINKING ABOUT SOCIAL SAFETY NETS. WITHOUT ACCESS TO BANKS ARE BUSINESSES ARE SERIOUSLY LIMITED THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO COVER ONE TIME COSTS. WE NEED ACCESS TO SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO HELP STABILIZE NOT GROWTH ORIENTED VENTURE CAPITAL. THE LEGISLATURE MUST ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO COVER ONE TIME REGULATORY COSTS. OR GIVE US LONGER TIMELINES TO COMPLY SO WE CAN SPREAD THESE COST OVER MULTIPLE HARVESTS. CALIFORNIA'S A BIG STATE COMMUNITIES ALL OVER ARE FACING SIMILAR IMPACTS. SPECIFIC PROBLEMS AND BARRIERS MIGHT BE DIFFERENT BUT THE URGENCY IS THE SAME. ONE IS YOU THAT IS ESPECIALLY PRONOUNCED ON THE NORTH COAST IS THE CANNABIS FARMERS ARE BEING REQUIRED TO COVER COSTS OF CLEAN UP FOR LEGACY ISSUES THAT EXIST ON OR NEAR OUR FARMS. BUT THAT WE DID NOT CAUSE AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY RELATED TO CANNABIS CULTIVATION. THERE IS GREAT UNFAIRNESS TO THE COSTS. IT'S AS THOUGH THE REGULATIONS ARE TRYING TO ADDRESS THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF THE PAST TIMBER BLOOM ON THE BACKS OF SMALL CANNABIS FARMERS. PROVIDING MULTI YEAR TIMELINES FOR REMEDIATION WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT FARMERS ABLE TO MAKE THE TRANSITION TO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT RESTORATION WORK IS COMPLETED. THE COST OF TRANSITION IS SO EXPENSIVE THAT MANY PHARMACY SCALING UP IS THE ONLY WAY TO SUCCEED. AND INVESTORS ARE QUICK TO REINFORCE THIS. MY FARM IS THE SIZE IT WANTS TO BE. I AM THE FARMER I WANT TO BE. I CANNOT SCALE UP. IF REGULATION IS GOING TO SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA POLICYMAKERS MUST LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO SUCCEED. ESPECIALLY AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. IF THERE IS NO PATHWAY TO COMPLIANCE AND NO OTHER JOBS PEOPLE WILL STAY IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET PLACE. AND FORCE MEANT WITHOUT OPPORTUNITY IS A BROKEN PARADIGM. IN CLOSING THIS CAN STILL WORK. BUT WE NEED SYSTEMATIC COMPREHENSIVE REFORMS TO REDUCE BARRIERS AND ENSURE THAT AS MANY BUSINESSES AS POSSIBLE CAN AND TO THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE. FOR ME. EXCESSIVE REGULATION IN OUR STATE WILL BE DIRECTLY CORRELATED TO HOW WIDESPREAD THE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY OF CANNABIS CAN BE. AND IF OUR COMMUNITIES CAN WEATHER THE TRANSITION. RIGHT NOW. IT LOOKS BLEAK. WE NEED YOUR HELP. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER O'NEILL MISTER MOORE SAID. MY NAME'S KENNY MORRISON. AMER MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR ARE BROKEN DOWN MY COMMENTS INTO THREE CATEGORIES ON LICENSE RETAIL ACTIVITY TESTING AND EXCISE TAXES. AS A BOARD MEMBER OF BOTH THE CIA AND CCMA. DURING INTERNAL DEBATES. I HEAR THE INDUSTRY VACILLATE BETWEEN SUPPORTING GREATER ENFORCEMENT ON UNLICENSED RETAIL ACTIVITY AND REQUESTING THE RAPID GRANTING OF MORE RETAIL LICENSES. THE BOTTOM LINE. IS SINCE MOST LOCALITIES HAVE MOVED TOO SLOW IN GETTING THEIR CANNABIS PROGRAM GOING. IT'S MAKING LEGALISATION LOOK A LOT LIKE PROHIBITION. A STATE EXCISE TAX REDUCTION ALLOWS ROOM FOR MUNICIPALITIES TO GET A MUCH NEEDED SECOND BITE OF THE APPLE. THIS WOULD ENCOURAGE LOCAL LICENSURE. SECONDLY IT'S NAIVE TO THINK THAT THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS ARE ADAMANT ABOUT SHOPPING AT A LICENSED RETAILER. FOR THE MAJORITY IT RARELY CROSSES THEIR MINDS WHAT MATTERS TO THE MAJORITY OF CONSUMERS IS ACCESS IN THE FORM OF AFFORDABILITY. A TEN DOLLAR UNLICENSED PURCHASE IS FAR MORE DESIRABLE THAN A THIRTY DOLLAR LICENSED PURCHASE FOR THE SAME ITEM. UNLICENSED RETAILERS ARE CAPTURING CUSTOMERS BETTER THAN LICENSED ONCE. I'VE OPERATED STATE LICENSED BUSINESSES CANNABIS BUSINESSES IN BOTH CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON. AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE SO FAR. IN WASHINGTON VERY QUICKLY FOR THE CONSUMER REGULATED CANNABIS WAS FAR CHEAPER THAN UNREGULATED CANNABIS. THE REASON WASHINGTON'S REGULATED MARKET FLOURISHED IS BECAUSE IT WAS ABLE TO QUICKLY UNDERCUT THE UNREGULATED MEDICAL STORES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM. THE PROBLEM WITH CALIFORNIA'S REGULATED ECOSYSTEM IS THAT IT ONLY MONITORS THOSE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. THE BIGGEST THREATS TO LEGALIZATION CURRENTLY RESIDE OUTSIDE OF IT. IN THE IMMEDIATE AND NEAR TERM VIRTUALLY ALL EFFORTS TO REGULATE CANNABIS SHOULD FOCUS ON THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF JOINING THE REGULATED SPHERE. IF WE FEEL IT'S A MATTER OF RESOURCES THAT ENFORCEMENT IS EXPENSIVE JUST LOOK AT THE COST OF NOT ENFORCING TAX REVENUE IS BEING SIPHONED FROM THE STATE BY UNLICENSED RETAILERS OUT IN AN ARMY AT AN ALARMING RATE. EXCISE TAX WE HAVE A SERIOUS CRISIS ON OUR HANDS WITH REGARDS TO EXCISE TAX ITS COLLECTION IT'S REMITTANCE. THE PROCESS IS BEGGING TO BE STREAMLINED FOR STARTERS WASHINGTON AND OTHER STATES ALREADY TRIED MULTIPLE POINTS OF TAXATION ALONG THE SUPPLY CHAIN. IT QUICKLY ALL GOT PUSHED TO A RETAIL TAX THAT RETAILERS COLLECT AND REMIT THEMSELVES. IF A RETAILER CAN COLLECT AND REMIT SALES TAX WITHHOLDING REMAIN PAYROLL TAX EXCISE TAXES SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME MODEL. WE'VE HEARD BCC HAS NO AUTHORITY OVER UNLICENSED LOCATIONS. IF TAXES WERE COLLECTED AND REMITTED FROM RETAIL THAN ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY COULD TRANSFER TO THE CD TFA. LET'S GET THAT MONEY CALIFORNIA. TESTING AND TAX REMITTANCE ARE BOTH AREAS THAT CAN BE EXTREMELY. STREAMLINED. THE STATE AND THE INDUSTRY UNDERSTANDS AND ADMITS WE HAVE OVER REGULATION DUE TO A PUBLIC IMAGE PROBLEM. THE STATE NEEDS TO REMEMBER THE IMAGE PROBLEM EXISTS DOES DO TO THOSE WITH NO INTENTION OF EVER PLAYING BY THE RULES. NOT THE GOOD GUYS WILLING TO SET THE EXAMPLE. BOTH C. CIA AND CCMA SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE BY THE STATE OF CANNABIS BUSINESS LOCATIONS. UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS THE DISTRIBUTOR MYSELF I JUST CAN'T UNDERSCORE HOW MUCH LIABILITY THERE IS IN STORING SOMEONE ELSE'S MONEY. ESPECIALLY AT SOME OF THE AREAS CANNABIS FACILITIES ARE REGULATE RELEGATED TO. ASKING A HUNDRED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY OR SO DISTRIBUTORS IN THE STATE TO STORE ALL THAT CASH AND ONLY REMIT ONCE PER QUARTER IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. ESPECIALLY WITH OUR ADDRESSES SEARCHABLE ONLINE. BANKS HOLD LESS CASH THAN WE DO. TESTING. AS THE CANNABIS MANUFACTURE FOR MANY YEARS I'VE ALWAYS TESTED EVERY SINGLE BATCH OF MY PRODUCT AND TESTING COSTS ARE STILL TEN AXING THIS YEAR. WE CAN'T LET STRICT TESTING PROTOCOLS AND INSUFFICIENT ACCESS TO TESTING SERVICES STIFLE THE INDUSTRY. COME THIS JULY WE NEED TO LEARN FROM ORGAN AND AVOID DEVASTATINGLY LONG LEAD TIMES. WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THE MUST BE TESTED IN FINAL FORM LANGUAGE IN STATUTE MEANS THAT MULTIPLE PRODUCT CODES CAN USE A SINGLE TEST RESULT TO MINIMIZE REDUNDANT TESTS. FOR INSTANCE OF A COUPLE EXAMPLES IF I MAKE A SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE BAG OF CHOCOLATE THAT ALL COME FROM THE SAME BATCH OF CHOCOLATE DO I NEED TO TEST ALL THREE PRODUCT CODES. IF I FEEL HALF GRAM VEIT CARTRIDGE AND A ONE GRAM FAKE CARTRIDGE WITH THE SAME OIL. DO I NEED TO TEST BOTH SIZES. ONE MORE EXAMPLE. IF I USE THREE DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THREE DIFFERENT TERRITORIES OF THE STATE TO TEST PRODUCTS THAT ALL CAME FROM THE STAIN THE SAME BATCH. DO I NEED TO TEST THAT SAME BATCH THREE TIMES. ANOTHER CONCERN AS A MANUFACTURER. IS THAT A TEN PERCENT PLUS OR MINUS POTENCY VARIANTS ACTUALLY DISCOURAGES THE MANUFACTURE OF MICRO DOES PRODUCTS. WHICH ITEMS BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE MILLIGRAMS AND UNDER. WE NEED A SLIDING SCALE FOR VARIANCES WHICH MAKES RESPONSIBLE MICRODISK PRODUCTS ACHIEVABLE. FOR INSTANCE IF I MAKE A TWO MILLIGRAM PRODUCT THERE'S NO LAB THAT WILL FEEL COMFORTABLE A TESTING TO A VARIANCE WITHIN ONLY TWO TENTHS. OF A MILLIGRAM. ALL THESE ISSUES ABOVE HER MADE EVEN WORSE WITHOUT CROSS LAB STANDARDIZATION. WE NEED CROSS LAB STANDARDIZATION WHEN IT COMES TO TESTING PROTOCOLS SO'S CONSUMERS AND MANUFACTURERS CAN TRUST TRUST THE RESULTS THEY GET WHEN SWITCHING FROM LAB TO LAB. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW A ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS POINT AND I JUST FOR OUR COLLEAGUES BILL A HARD STEP AT TWELVE TWENTY. SO ANY CUT COMES AND. MISTER WOOD IN THE MISTER LIKE. I'M JUST CURIOUS ON PRO AND PRY MORE TO RECORD TO. MISTER O'NEILL. WHETHER ANY. CHO FAIRS COMING TOGETHER TO CREATE CO OPS LIKE IN AG. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU. I HAD THE PLEASURE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS WORKING ON. A PROJECT WE WERE OPERATING ON. WORKING ON A AN AGRICULTURAL COOP MODEL THAT IS NO LONGER AUTHORIZED UNDER THE RAGS BUT NOW. WE ARE VERY VERY GLAD TO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO AGGREGATE AS COOPERATIVES AND WE ARE DEFINITELY WORKING ON THAT AS THE EMERALD GROWN PROJECT IN MEDICINE YOU KNOW. ON THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER. COOPERATIVE PROJECTS GETTING MOVING AS WELL I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF. LEADING UNDER MY SILO WITH CAL GROWERS THE COOPERATIVE SUBCOMMITTEE WORKING ON COOPER DEVELOPMENT FIGURING OUT WHAT EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS PROJECTS ARE TRYING TO DO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS WITHIN THE REGULATED MARKETPLACE THE COOPERATIVE PROJECTS MIGHT ENGAGE IN. AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO VERY MUCH AND I AND I THINK WILL BE VERY HELPFUL FOR SMALL FARMS IT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT TO HAMMER OUT ON AND STONE AND WE DEATHLY LOOK FORWARD TO. WORKING THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TAXES OBVIOUSLY IS YOU KNOW WE HEARD FROM THE LEAGUE ABOUT THAT MAYBE FIVE PERCENT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER. DO YOU AS AN IT DOES THE INDUSTRY HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THAT WHAT THAT NUMBER SHOULD BE. FROM THE FARM PERSPECTIVE. ANYTHING LOWER IS GOING TO HELL IT'S IT'S REALLY HARD RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY MEDICINE ACCOUNT IS TRADITIONALLY VERY SMALL CULTIVATION SIZE ARE WE ARE CAPPED AT TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET AND AND PEOPLE ARE GETTING MARRIED RIGHT NOW BY THE COST. DO YOU SENSE. THANK YOU THINK MISTER LACKEY. YOU'RE JUST REAL QUICKLY MY QUESTION IS FOR MR MORSE WHAT KIND OF. OF ILLEGAL ACTIVITY YOU SEE GOING ON IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. THERE'S PLENTY. THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE A BETTER. BETTER QUESTION FOR MY CALL CENTER WHICH IS FIELDING CALLS FROM DISPENSARIES ALL DAY. I AS I WAS SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY I GOT A. ATTACKS FROM SOMEONE WHO IS SHOCKED THAT I WILL NO LONGER BE. ABLE TO SERVE THEIR. DATA ILLEGAL DELIVERY SERVICE. A I I LIVE IN VENICE BEACH. MY BUSINESS OPERATES OUT OF OAKLAND. AND. YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THE THE CITY IS IS SLOW TO GRANT THE LOCAL AUTHORITY WHICH IS ALLOWING. THE STATE TO GIVE THEM THEIR TEMPORARY LICENSE BUT I THINK. DE I MEAN I I SAW LAST WEEK I THINK ON MONDAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY NEW LICENSES WERE GRANTED AND YOU KNOW THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE IS ANOTHER FORTY AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. BUT.

BESSUS MISTER THERE'S FIFTY THOUSAND FARMS IN THE STATE AS A YEAR AGO AVERAGE SQUARE FOOTAGE ABOUT SIXTEEN THOUSAND SQUARE FEET BASED ON A SURVEY BY CONSULTING COMPANY I WORK FOR. PUT THOSE TWO NUMBERS TOGETHER ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND CULTIVATION ACRES BEST ESTIMATES FROM CONSORTIUM OF STUDIES ON THE TOPIC IS THAT STATE DEMAND LEGALLY IS GONNA BE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED ACRES. CURRENTLY AS OF THE NUMBERS THIS MORNING WE'RE DANGEROUSLY CLOSE OVERSATURATION OVERSATURATION MEANS PRICE DROP PRICE DROP MEANS. DISPROPORTIONATE AFFECTING SMALL PRODUCERS. WHEN I WALK BEFORE CALAVERAS COUNTY ABOUT A YEAR AGO UNTIL THEN THEY HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND FARMS IN THE COUNTY THEY LAUGHED INTO THE COULD BE MORE THAN FIFTY. I HAD THAT PROCESS REPEAT ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES NO ONE IS AWARE TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR ECONOMIES RELY ON THE SMALL PRODUCERS.

THE LACK OF A ONE ACRE CAP. OVERSATURATION IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE SMALL PRODUCE AT SUSTAINABLE FARMS IT'S AN ISSUE OF PERHAPS A MASSIVE ECONOMIC RECESSION OF FORTY PERCENT OF THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA OF THE RURAL PART OF THE STATE THINK YOU THAT IS IMPORTANT. TO US TO CONSIDER THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH BEGIN NAME AND AFFILIATION IF YOU WISH PLEASE. LEARN FRAZIER CANNABIS DISTRIBUTION ASSOCIATION WE'VE IN REPRESENTING THE DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT SINCE JUNE TWENTY SIXTEEN AS A POLICY ADVOCACY AND. UP TRADE ASSOCIATION WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PLUS MEMBERS. ONE OF THE MAJOR AREAS OF CONFUSION IN THE REGULATED MARKETS FOR MARKET RIGHT NOW IT HAS TO DO WITH THE TIMING OF AT TAX COLLECTION REMITTANCE BY DISTRIBUTORS AND WHO BEARS THE COST OF THAT TAX. SO AS THE TAX COLLECTORS ARE MEMBERS OFTEN FIND THEMSELVES EDUCATING PRODUCERS AND RETAILERS ABOUT WHAT THEIR TAX LIABILITIES ARE. AND WE ALSO FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF. AS THE LIABLE PARTY WANTING TO COLLECT AND REMIT THOSE TAXES SOONER WHERE'S THE. PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING THOSE TAXES WANTS TO REMIT THAT TAX LATER. ADDITIONALLY I HAVE WITH THE LACK OF ENFORCEMENT. THE UNLICENSED MARKET IS THRIVING ALONGSIDE OUR LICENSE MARKET AS WAS BROUGHT UP SEVERAL TIMES TODAY. AND THE IMPACT OF THAT IS THAT THE PRICE FOR FLOWER HAS DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT'S MAKING IT UNECONOMICAL FOR OUR SMALL SMALL FARMERS TO SURVIVE ALONG WITH THAT COMPOUNDING OF TAXES. I ADDITIONALLY. THE IMPACT OF THE INCENTIVE FOR CONSUMERS TO SHOP AT UNLICENSED SHOPS WHERE TAX OUR PRICES ARE FORTY PERCENT. A LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE SHOPS A NEXT DOOR TO THEM AND SO THOSE ARE THE. MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE AS AN ASSOCIATION ARE WORKING ON I'M IN ADDITION TO SEVERAL OTHERS IN MANAGEMENT THINKING. YOU. PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS GABRIEL USE MINE I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF LATINOS FOR CANNABIS AND THE CALIFORNIA MINORITY ALLIANCE LIKE TO SAVE FIRST FOREMOST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR HARD WORK AND FOR TAKING THE TIME TO YOUR CONCERNS.

RATHER THAN IN NINETEEN TWENTY IN ORDER TO ASSURE AND ELIMINATE ANY ERRORS IN THE REST PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS DUE TO THE LACK OF RESOURCES IN PROPER EDUCATION. ON THE PROPER ENFORCEMENT OF THE SCOUT CANNABIS REGULATIONS. ALSO LIKE TO SEE MORE WORKSHOPS MADE AVAILABLE IN DENSELY POPULATED CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES TO ASSURE THAT. OPERATORS ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND ALSO DISCOURAGE OPERATORS FROM OPERATING LEGAL MARKETPLACE DUE TO THE LACK OF EDUCATION RESOURCES AND COMPLIANCE WORKSHOPS. I AM PARTICULARLY CONCERNED. MAINLY THAT THESE FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLORS FACE BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE APPLICATION LICENSING FEES. THESE. EXCESSIVE FEES CREATE MULTIPLE BARRIERS AND PARTICIPATION I LIKE TO SEE MORE DIALOGUE ON THIS TOPIC ON AGAIN LATE ALSO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULATING BAD OPERATORS WHO USE L. L. SEES.
