00:06:43.102 --> 00:06:44.403
DELETING THIS EXEMPTION IS

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.172

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.222
CURRENTLY THE LAW IS UNCLEAR

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.024
ABOUT THE TYPE THE TYPES OF

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:39.559

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:46.265
ALSO UNCLEAR.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:50.136
SO THIS BILL WILL BOTH FOR THE

00:07:50.203 --> 00:07:52.805
FAR AND THE CALL TO PRODUCE

00:07:52.872 --> 00:07:55.641

ASSOCIATION --

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.885
THEIR CONCERNS AS I UNDERSTAND

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:06.652
IT HAVE TO DO WITH THE

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.955
CONFIDENTIALITY OF THESE RECORDS

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.289
A TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.191
CONCERNS DON'T IN ANY WAY IMPEDE

00:08:12.258 --> 00:08:13.626

HAS CONCERNS THAT ARE AGAIN NOT

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:33.880
GOING TO UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:34.947
THIS BILL.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.416
SO WITH ME I HAVE A DAN JACOBSON

STRONG STATE STANDARDS.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.957
IN SAFEGUARDING OUR INTRA STATE

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:46.492
HAZARDOUS LIQUID.

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.828
PIPELINES AND WITH THAT I WOULD

00:08:48.895 --> 00:08:50.830
ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:51.864
THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

COMMITTEE AND AGAIN THANK YOU TO

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:57.103
SENATORS. TO SENATOR JACKSON FOR

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.537
ONCE AGAIN BRINGING FORWARD SOME

00:08:58.604 --> 00:08:59.672
CRITICAL ENVIRONMENTAL

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:01.340
LEGISLATION.

00:09:01.407 --> 00:09:02.842
OIL SPILLS ARE DIRTY AND

00:09:02.909 --> 00:09:05.111
DANGEROUS AND EVEN A SALL CASE

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:05.978
SOMETIMES IN THE CASE OF

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.713
THOUSANDS OR TENS OF THOUSANDS

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:08.915
OF GALLONS IS BAD FOR THE

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.216
ENVIRONMENT.

00:09:10.283 --> 00:09:12.084
THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS CAUSED

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.052
BY THIS BILL CAN REALLY FALL

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:14.954
INTO THREE CATEGORIES FIRST IS

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:16.355
THE WATER CONTAMINATION

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:17.957
OFTENTIMES THESE BILLS WHILE

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.892
THEY MAY BE DETECTED WITHIN A

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:20.493
FEW HOURS.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:22.695
TAKE DAYS IF NOT WEEKS TO GET

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.397
CLEANED UP IN WHICH CASE THE OIL

00:09:24.463 --> 00:09:26.065
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAK INTO

00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:27.333
THE GROUND WATER.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.734
THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE IN THE

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:29.702
STATE WERE TRYING TO DO

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:32.271
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:34.307
PEOPLE HAVE SAFE AND CLEAN

00:09:34.373 --> 00:09:36.208
DRINKING WATER. TWO IS THE LAND

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.544
IN SOIL CONTAMINATION SIMILAR TO

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:40.546
THE WATER CONTAMINATION ONCE

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.448
THIS OIL LEAKS INTO THE GROUND

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.650
IT CAN TAKE YEARS TO CLEAN UP

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:46.652
AND COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:47.954
DOLLARS TO DO SO.

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.055
AND THIRD OBVIOUSLY THE

00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.523
ECOSYSTEM IMPACTS THAT ARE

00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:52.224
CAUSED BY THESE BILLS NO ONE

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:54.093
NEEDS TO BE REMINDED AGAIN OF

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.529
THE SOIL BIRCHER SOILED ANIMALS

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:57.897
THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.398
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ONE SMALL

00:09:59.465 --> 00:10:00.967
PLACE IT'S IMPACTED IT'S THE

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:03.269
WHOLE ECOSYSTEM THAT HAS TO FACE

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:05.104
THE IMPACT WHEN WE SEE THESE

00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.672
BILLS EVEN IF THEY'RE SMALL.

00:10:06.739 --> 00:10:07.940
THE SECOND POINT THAT I THINK IS

00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:09.642
THAT OIL SPILLS ARE UNAVOIDABLE

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:10.743
WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THEM

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.044
THERE'S JUST NO GUARANTEE TO

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.246
MOVE OIL FROM POINT A TO POINT

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:15.881
B. ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO LEAKS.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:18.317
SOMETIMES THESE LEAKS ARE LARGE

00:10:18.384 --> 00:10:19.485
THANKFULLY THAT'S A VERY SMALL

00:10:19.552 --> 00:10:21.287
PERCENTAGE OF THE TIME BUT THE

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:23.222
SMALL LEAKS ADD UP THOUSANDS AND

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:24.724
THOUSANDS OF THE SMALL LEAKS

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:26.225
CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:26.959
OUR ENVIRONMENT.

00:10:27.026 --> 00:10:27.727
IN -- WE

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.962
NEED TO BE DOING EVERYTHING

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:31.497
ENSURE THAT EVERY FORM OF

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.866
TRANSPORTATION OF OIL AND OTHER

00:10:33.933 --> 00:10:35.501
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL IS DONE AS

00:10:35.568 --> 00:10:38.204
SAFELY AS POSSIBLE IN.

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:39.905
ALL JUST END BY SAYING THAT WE

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.640
HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.309
THAT WE CAN DO THIS IN A SAFER

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:44.110
FASHION.

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.112
AND WE SHOULD BE DOING OBVIOUSLY

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:48.014
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.882
EVERY DROP OF OIL OR OTHER

00:10:49.949 --> 00:10:51.183
HAZARDOUS MATERIAL THAT WE'RE

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.551
MOVING IN THE STATE.

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.620
CAN BE DONE SO IT DOESN'T IMPACT

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.422
OUR ENVIRONMENT AND IT HAS NO

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.790
IMPACT ON OUR HEALTH.

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.125
I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING OBVIOUSLY

00:10:59.191 --> 00:11:00.359
AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THERE ARE

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:01.861
TIMES TO ROLL BACK SOME OF THE

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:02.561
BASIC PROTECTIONS THAT WE'RE

00:11:02.628 --> 00:11:04.196
SEEING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:05.698
CALIFORNIA NOT ONLY STAYS THE

00:11:05.765 --> 00:11:06.298
COURSE.

00:11:06.365 --> 00:11:07.933
BUT CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD ON

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:57.889
OF UNPRECEDENTED SIZE AND

00:20:57.956 --> 00:21:00.092
INTENSITY WHICH HAVE KILLED OVER

00:21:00.158 --> 00:21:01.193
A HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:03.228
CALIFORNIANS DESTROYED THOUSANDS

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:04.096
OF HOMES.

00:21:04.162 --> 00:21:06.064
AND BURNED OVER WELL OVER A

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:09.201
MILLION ACRES OF LAND.

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:10.469
THESE FREQUENT LARGE SCALE WATER

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.504
FIRES HAVE FOCUSED ATTENTION ON

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:15.107
HOW CALIFORNIA WARNS THE PUBLIC

00:21:15.173 --> 00:21:16.642
DURING EMERGENCIES.

00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.276
IN THE OLD DAYS THE CHURCH BELLS

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.311
RANG.

00:21:19.378 --> 00:21:21.246
WHEN I WAS A KID GOING GROWING

00:21:21.313 --> 00:21:22.581
UP WE HAD THE CONRAD?

00:21:22.648 --> 00:21:23.515
EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WE THOUGHT

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:26.518
WE WERE GOING TO RUSSIA BIG

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:27.986
SYSTEM WOULD GO OFF ON YOUR

00:21:28.053 --> 00:21:29.888
RADIO OR IN THE COMMUNITY WE

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:31.423
DON'T HAVE THOSE ANYMORE.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.358
SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT DO WE DO

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.793
WHEN WE ARE SORT OF FACING AN

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.396
EMERGENCY WHEN A WILDFIRE IS

00:21:37.462 --> 00:21:39.498
MOVING AT RAPID SPEED HOW DO WE

00:21:39.564 --> 00:21:41.033
LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE IN

00:21:41.099 --> 00:21:41.733
DANGER.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:44.536
AND WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO GET

00:21:44.603 --> 00:21:46.104
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:49.374
THESE FREQUENT FIRES HAVE SHOWN

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.776
US THE HOLES IN OUR SYSTEM.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.244
AND ART AND THE FACT THAT ARE

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:53.545
WARNING SYSTEMS COME IN A

00:21:53.612 --> 00:21:56.481
VARIETY OF FORMS AND EACH HAS

00:21:56.548 --> 00:21:58.784
SPECIFIC CAPABILITIES AS WELL AS

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.952
DRAWBACKS SYSTEMS RANGE FROM

00:22:01.019 --> 00:22:03.555
RELATIVELY LOW TECH OPTIONS.

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.023
LIKE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:08.527
LITERALLY GOING DOOR TO DOOR. TO

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:11.563
TELL PEOPLE THEY MUST VACATE. TO

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.398
OUTDOOR WARNING SIRENS TO AUTO

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.000
DARLING TELEPHONES THAT CAN

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:17.135
RELAY DETAILED EMERGENCY

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:19.237
INFORMATION TO HOUSES AT A BLOCK

00:22:19.304 --> 00:22:21.473
BY BLOCK LEVEL. ONE OF THE MORE

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.209
MODERN SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA AND

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:26.311
ACROSS THE WEST IS THE A LOT --

00:22:26.378 --> 00:22:29.314
WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:31.216
THE OUIJA SYSTEM IT'S CALLED.

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.317
ADMINISTERED BY FEDERAL

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:34.653
COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION'S.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.788
COMMISSION WE ARE ALLOWS MOBILE

00:22:36.855 --> 00:22:38.924
PHONE SUBSCRIBERS TO RECEIVE

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:42.027
GEOGRAPHICALLY TARGETED TAX LIKE

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:43.795
MESSAGES ALERTING THEM OF

00:22:43.862 --> 00:22:45.864
IMMINENT THREATS TO SAFETY IN

00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:47.065
THEIR AREA.

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:49.401
BUT IT TOO HAS ITS LIMITATIONS

00:22:49.468 --> 00:22:50.702
BECAUSE IT LACKS.

00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:53.071
ACTUAL PRECISION IT'S VERY SHORT

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:54.906
IN TERMS OF THE MESSAGING IT CAN

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.708
DO AND THERE'S NO WAY FOR TWO

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:57.909
WAY COMMUNICATION.

00:22:57.976 --> 00:23:02.180
AS AN EXAMPLE DURING OUR FAR TWO

00:23:02.247 --> 00:23:03.949
THIRTY IN THE MORNING MY CELL

00:23:04.015 --> 00:23:06.284
PHONE WENT OFF WITH THE WE ALERT.

00:23:06.351 --> 00:23:08.320
RIGHT NO IDEA WHERE EXACTLY THE

00:23:08.386 --> 00:23:10.489
PROBLEM WAS WAS IT TEN MILES

00:23:10.555 --> 00:23:13.058
AWAY WAS IT FIVE MILES AWAY WAS

00:23:13.125 --> 00:23:14.926
IT NEXT DOOR AND I COULD NOT

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:16.862
INTERACT WITH IT TO FIND OUT

00:23:16.928 --> 00:23:19.164
JUST EXACTLY WHERE THIS

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:21.032
EMERGENCY WAS OCCURRING.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:22.367
NOW MANY JURISDICTIONS IN

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:24.236
CALIFORNIA AND BY THE WAY DID

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:26.471
SCARE THE HECK OUT OF ME AS WELL.

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:28.306
AND IT WAS HARD GOING BACK TO

00:23:28.373 --> 00:23:30.308
SLEEP AFTER THAT AND MANY OF MY

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:32.677
NEIGHBORS AND THE PEOPLE WITHIN

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:35.380
THIS WE A SYSTEM GOT THE SAME

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:37.716
TEXT AND THE LORD AND ALSO DID

00:23:37.783 --> 00:23:39.684
NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:40.619
TO DO.

00:23:40.685 --> 00:23:41.787
SO MANY JURISDICTIONS IN

00:23:41.853 --> 00:23:43.755
CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTS SYSTEMS

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:44.589
LIKE WE ARE.

00:23:44.656 --> 00:23:46.558
WITH THEIR OWN LOCALLY OPERATED

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:48.727
EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:50.929
IN ORDER TO A MORE EFFECTIVELY

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:52.998
COMMUNICATE WITH RESIDENTS

00:23:53.064 --> 00:23:54.900
DURING AN EMERGENCY.

00:23:54.966 --> 00:23:56.868
THE SYSTEM SOMEONE CALLED NICK

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:58.303
SOUL CODE RED AND OTHERS.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.739
CAN SEND PRE RECORDED MESSAGES

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:02.908
TO LAND LINE TELEPHONES LOCATED

00:24:02.974 --> 00:24:05.710
WITHIN A DEFINED TARGET AREA.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.879
AS WELL AS SEND TEXT INVOICE A

00:24:07.946 --> 00:24:10.715
LARGE TO MOBILE TELEPHONES WHICH

00:24:10.782 --> 00:24:13.151
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE USING

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:15.654
TO THE EXCLUSION OF LAND LINE SO

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.789
THEY BECOME A CRITICAL PLAYER.

00:24:17.856 --> 00:24:20.959
IN THIS EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM.

00:24:21.026 --> 00:24:22.427
GIVEN THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO

00:24:22.494 --> 00:24:24.229
TARGET ALERTS USING PHYSICAL

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:27.032
ADDRESSES LOCALLY OPERATED NO

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:28.967
NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS ARE AMONG

00:24:29.034 --> 00:24:30.869
THE MOST PRECISE EMERGENCY

00:24:30.936 --> 00:24:32.437
NOTIFICATION SYSTEMS IN USE

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:33.305
TODAY.

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:34.906
BUT BECAUSE REGISTRATION OF

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.241
MOBILE PHONES WAS NOT UNTIL

00:24:36.308 --> 00:24:39.110
RECENTLY AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS

00:24:39.177 --> 00:24:40.445
MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE

00:24:40.512 --> 00:24:42.180
STRUGGLED TO GET RESIDENTS TO

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:44.649
SIGN UP TO RECEIVE THESE ALERTS.

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.818
FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE THOMAS FIRE

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.019
THEN THE LARGEST FIRE IN

00:24:48.086 --> 00:24:50.155
CALIFORNIA HISTORY BROKE OUT IN

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.690
MY DISTRICT.

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.392
LESS THAN 30% OF RESIDENTS IN

00:24:54.459 --> 00:24:56.127
THE AFFECTED AREA HAD ACTUALLY

00:24:56.194 --> 00:24:57.662
SIGNED UP TO RECEIVE COUNTY

00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.198
GENERATED CELL PHONE AND EMAIL

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:03.101
ALERTS LESS THAN 30%.

00:25:03.168 --> 00:25:04.402
SO LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE

00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:06.838
PASSED SB EIGHT TWENTY ONE WHICH

00:25:06.905 --> 00:25:08.707
AUTHORIZED COUNTY EMERGENCY

00:25:08.773 --> 00:25:10.242
MANAGEMENT OFFICIALS TO

00:25:10.308 --> 00:25:12.577
AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL RESIDENTS

00:25:12.644 --> 00:25:14.913
IN COUNTY OPERATED SYSTEMS.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.947
IT ENSURES THAT RESIDENTS WHO DO

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:20.252
NOT SEE THESE ALERTS HAVE THE

00:25:20.318 --> 00:25:22.654
OPPORTUNITY TO OPT OUT.

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:24.155
YOU'RE IN UNLESS YOU DON'T WANT

00:25:24.222 --> 00:25:26.524
TO BE AND THEN YOU CAN OPT OUT.

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:28.994
AND IT ALSO SPECIFICALLY

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.129
RESTRICTS COUNTIES FROM USING

00:25:31.196 --> 00:25:33.198
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT THEY

00:25:33.265 --> 00:25:35.233
OBTAIN TO ENROLL RESIDENTS IN

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.470
THIS NOTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR ANY.

00:25:38.536 --> 00:25:41.373
OTHER PURPOSE PERIOD.

00:25:41.439 --> 00:25:43.208
IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO LAW

00:25:43.275 --> 00:25:44.743
ENFORCEMENT FOR ANY OTHER

00:25:44.809 --> 00:25:46.711
PURPOSE THAN THESE ALERTS

00:25:46.778 --> 00:25:48.446
BECAUSE THAT IS THE SOLE AND

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:50.181
SINGULAR FUNCTION.

00:25:50.248 --> 00:25:51.850
OF THESE ALERT PROGRAMS THIS

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:53.785
BILL WAS A NECESSARY STEP TOWARD

00:25:53.852 --> 00:25:55.120
INCREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:56.855
RESIDENTS WHO RECEIVE EMERGENCY

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.324
ALERTS FROM COUNTY OFFICIALS BUT

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.825
MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO IMPROVE

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:03.361
THE DISSEMINATION AND UTILITY.

00:26:03.428 --> 00:26:04.930
OF MESSAGES SENT.

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:07.198
AND WE SAW SUBSEQUENT FIRES WE

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:08.767
SAW THE WALLS THE FIRE WHERE

00:26:08.833 --> 00:26:11.836
STUDENTS WERE ASKED --

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:14.773
TO STAY ON SITE WE CALL IT.

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:17.175
SHELTERING ON SITE HOW DID THEY

00:26:17.242 --> 00:26:19.511
KNOW TO DO THAT WELL IT TURNS

00:26:19.577 --> 00:26:21.546
OUT THAT A LOT OF THE UNIVERSITY

00:26:21.613 --> 00:26:22.914
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY DID

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:25.116
NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO THEIR

00:26:25.183 --> 00:26:27.319
INFORMATION THE SAME THING IT TO

00:26:27.385 --> 00:26:29.020
US CSU CHANNEL ISLANDS TO MY

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:30.622
DISTRICT WHICH HAS SUFFERED A

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:32.524
FEW A COUPLE FIRES OVER THE LAST

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.458
FEW YEARS.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:36.194
HOW DO YOU LET THE STUDENTS KNOW

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.163
AND SO THE BILL THIS YEAR ADD

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:39.397
CITIES?

00:26:39.464 --> 00:26:41.967
AND UNIVERSITIES TO THE PROGRAM

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:44.202
SO THAT THEY CAN WARN STUDENTS

00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:45.737
AND WARN PEOPLE WITHIN THEIR

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.906
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ABOUT WHAT

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:50.075
IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THEY NEED

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:50.775
TO DO.

00:26:50.842 --> 00:26:53.378
TO BE SAFE UNDER THESE HORRIFIC

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:56.514
SORT BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT

00:26:56.581 --> 00:26:57.949
MORE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

00:26:58.016 --> 00:26:59.751
RECEIVED CRITICAL EMERGENCY

00:26:59.818 --> 00:27:01.519
ALERTS BY EXPANDING THE OP OUT

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:03.288
SYSTEM.

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.756
IT CLARIFIES THAT ALERTING

00:27:04.823 --> 00:27:07.192
AUTHORITIES MAY USE WIRELESS

00:27:07.258 --> 00:27:09.427
TELEPHONE SUBSCRIBER DATA TO

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.997
ENROLL RESIDENTS IN THE SYSTEMS

00:27:12.063 --> 00:27:13.932
AGAIN IT MAINTAINS THE SAME

00:27:13.999 --> 00:27:14.699
PROTECTIONS.

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:17.168
THAT EXIST THAT THESE CAN ONLY

00:27:17.235 --> 00:27:19.170
BE USED FOR A VERY SPECIFIC AND

00:27:19.237 --> 00:27:20.605
LIMITED PURPOSE.

00:27:20.672 --> 00:27:23.041
AND IT ALSO AUTHORIZES COUNTY

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.709
SOCIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENTS WE

00:27:24.776 --> 00:27:26.378
LEARN THIS IS WELL.

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:27.712
WE LEARNED THIS IN THE PARADISE

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.381
FAR WE LEARNED THIS IN THE FIRES

00:27:29.447 --> 00:27:32.017
UP IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT

00:27:32.083 --> 00:27:33.585
THERE ARE PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL

00:27:33.651 --> 00:27:36.121
NEEDS WHO NEED TO BE NOTIFIED AT

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:37.889
THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE STAGE.

00:27:37.956 --> 00:27:39.824
SO THAT EFFORTS CAN BE MADE TO

00:27:39.891 --> 00:27:41.860
EVACUATE THEM SO THAT THEY DON'T

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:44.229
END UP AS VICTIMS AS ONE OF THE

00:27:44.295 --> 00:27:45.430
HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO PLUS

00:27:45.497 --> 00:27:45.930
PEOPLE.

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:48.299
WHO WERE KILLED DURING THE MOST

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:49.701
RECENT FIRES SO?

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.636
WHEN DISASTER STRIKES COLLEAGUES

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:53.905
EMERGENCY OFFICIALS MUST BE ABLE

00:27:53.972 --> 00:27:56.474
TO NOTIFY RESIDENTS QUICKLY AND

00:27:56.541 --> 00:27:57.308
EFFECTIVELY?

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.544
THE MEASURE ALSO SAYS THAT

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.513
TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS WHO

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:04.015
ARE NOW A KEY COMPONENT OF THIS

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.116
WHOLE SYSTEM.

00:28:05.183 --> 00:28:07.118
HAVE TO SUPPLY THE P. YOU SEE

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:08.987
WITH SPECIFIC DATA REGARDING

INTO THESE INCIDENTS BECAME

WHATEVER REASON MANY PEOPLE JUST

00:30:58.156 --> 00:31:00.658
DON'T DO IT.

00:31:00.725 --> 00:31:01.993
FOLLOWING THE THREE INCIDENTS

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.528

WEAKNESSES OF THE UNIVERSE THESE

00:31:11.603 --> 00:31:12.670
EMERGENCIES AND THE IMPACT THAT

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:14.305
THEY HAD ON OUR COMMUNITY.

00:31:14.372 --> 00:31:15.440
WE DISCUSSED OUR EXPERIENCES

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:17.108
WITH EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION AND

00:31:17.175 --> 00:31:18.343
THE FACT THAT SO MANY STUDENTS

00:31:18.409 --> 00:31:20.345
HAVE REPORTED TO US THAT THEY

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.146
HAD NEVER RECEIVED OUR MESSAGES.

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:22.947
WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.983
OUR OWN INFORMATION SYSTEMS USED

00:31:25.049 --> 00:31:25.817

00:31:36.127 --> 00:31:37.695
SYSTEM.

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:39.464
IT MAKES SENSE TO TAKING A FULL

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.765
INFORMATION THAT WE ALREADY HAVE

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.166

00:31:43.501 --> 00:31:45.436
AND GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:46.971
TO OPT OUT OF THAT SYSTEM RATHER

00:31:47.038 --> 00:31:48.873
THAN TO TRY TO CONVINCE THEM TO

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.974
OPT IN.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.209
DON'T DO IT THAT WAY BECAUSE WE

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:53.044
BELIEVE TO BE UNLAWFUL. FOR US

00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:54.212
TO UTILIZE STUDENTS PHONE

00:31:57.215 --> 00:31:58.082
WE BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL BE

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:59.917

00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:22.326

00:34:29.667 --> 00:34:30.868
COMMUNICATIONS METHODS THAT WE

BUT IT IS A ONE AND DONE

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:42.079
STRATEGY WHEN IT SENDS A MESSAGE

IF YOUR PHONE IS IN A LOW SIGNAL

00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:45.349

YOU WON'T GET THAT MESSAGE THIS

00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:48.553
IS PART OF THE REASON WHY MANY

00:34:48.619 --> 00:34:50.288
PEOPLE ARE NOT RECEIVING WE A

00:34:50.354 --> 00:34:51.589

WELL IN THE ANALYSIS --

YOU HAVE TO OPT OUT OF IT --

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.986
WHICH IS ONE OF ITS STRENGTHS.

00:36:29.053 --> 00:36:30.621
IT'S BY FAR THE MOST ROBUST

00:36:30.688 --> 00:36:32.056
WARNING SYSTEM --

00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:33.524
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HASN'T BEEN

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:35.226
USED IN SOME RECENT INCIDENTS

00:36:35.293 --> 00:36:36.794

LOCAL EMERGENCY WARNING SYSTEM

00:36:52.343 --> 00:36:53.644

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE BILL IS

00:37:04.922 --> 00:37:06.023
THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT

MORE FEDERAL LAWS.

FURTHER AND EQUALLY IF NOT MORE

00:37:31.582 --> 00:37:33.084
TROUBLING THE BILL REQUIRES THE

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.985
COMMISSION TO COLLECT FROM

00:37:34.051 --> 00:37:35.720

THE STUFF WE DO.

00:37:43.995 --> 00:37:45.630
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO REPORT ON

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.832
WHAT THESE GENTLEMEN DO BUT WE

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:48.799
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT

00:37:48.866 --> 00:37:50.768

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.204
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IT

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.473
RUNS OVER OUR REGULAR --

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:56.474
CARRIER NETWORKS SO WE'RE NOT

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:59.076
SURE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:09.553
CONTROL --

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.055
IT ALSO FLIPS THE PRESUMPTION OF

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:13.357
CONFIDENTIALITY FOR NETWORK

00:38:13.424 --> 00:38:14.925

THE DISCLOSURE OF THIS

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.830
INFORMATION CONTRAVENES INDUSTRY

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:26.203

TRADE SECRETS.

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:34.945
WE BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.480
HANDLE THESE ISSUES IS THE WAY

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:37.281

YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN ANTI AND THE

WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS ON THE

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.867
FRONTLINE OF EVERY SINGLE

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:31.235
EMERGENCY.

00:39:31.302 --> 00:39:32.970
UNFORTUNATELY THIS PARTICULAR

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.972
BILL HAS TWO MAJOR PROVISIONS

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:37.007
ONE IN SECTION FOUR AND ONE IN

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.542
SECTION.

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:41.145
FIVE THAT WE OBJECT.

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:43.981
TO STEVE SPOKE TO THE ISSUE OF A

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:45.516
OF THE FACT THAT THE BILL

00:39:45.583 --> 00:39:47.451
PRESUMES TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:49.253
PROVIDERS CONTROL THE ALERT

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.822
SYSTEMS WE DO NOT.

00:39:51.889 --> 00:39:53.791
WANT ALERT ORIGINATORS SUCH AS A

00:39:53.858 --> 00:39:56.227
CITY OR A COUNTY SENDS OUT A

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:58.028
WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT OR

ALERTING PHONE CALLS AS WAS

00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:01.432
MENTIONED IN TERMS OF LAND LINES

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:04.001

NOT HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR

00:40:09.373 --> 00:40:10.407

00:40:10.474 --> 00:40:12.710
WE DO NOT SEE OR HEAR WHAT THESE

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.479
MESSAGES SAY WE DO NOT DECIDE

00:40:15.546 --> 00:40:17.248
WHERE THE MESSAGES GO THEY

00:40:17.314 --> 00:40:19.016
SELECT THAT AUTOMATICALLY IN THE

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.317
SYSTEM.

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:22.753
AND WE DO NOT RECEIVE A RECEIPT

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.122
OF WHEN THESE MESSAGES ARE

00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:26.423
DELIVERED.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:28.259
BY DESIGN BECAUSE IN AN

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.927
EMERGENCY THE SYSTEM WAS

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:32.930
DESIGNED TO AVOID CONGESTION SO

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:34.598
THE WIRELESS EMERGENCY ALERT

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:37.034
SYSTEM IS DEFINITELY A ONE WAY

00:40:37.101 --> 00:40:38.569
SYSTEM.

00:40:38.636 --> 00:40:39.837
THIS IS BECAUSE ALERT

00:40:39.904 --> 00:40:41.705
ORIGINATORS USE THIRD PARTY

00:40:41.772 --> 00:40:44.408

00:40:44.475 --> 00:40:46.510
AND DETERMINE WHERE THEY GO.

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:49.380
SECOND SB FORTY SIX SEEKS TO

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:51.048
IMPOSE P. UC REPORTING

00:40:51.115 --> 00:40:53.450

THE P. YOU SEE AND THE FCC.

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.503
THEY ARE MARKED CONFIDENTIAL AND

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.038

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:28.118
SIMPLY PUT SB FORTY SIX IS BUILT

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.987
BUT THESE TWO SECTIONS ARE ON

00:41:30.054 --> 00:41:32.089
FALSE PREMISES A THAT WE HAVE

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:32.923
THE INFORMATION THAT WE COULD

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.824
REPORT.

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.693
AND BE IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO BE

00:41:35.759 --> 00:41:37.828
PUBLISHING THIS INFORMATION OR

00:41:37.895 --> 00:41:39.730
FLIPPING THE PRESUMPTION.

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:40.998
AT THE P. YOU SEE THAT IT SHOULD

00:41:41.065 --> 00:41:44.535
BE PUBLIC RATHER THAN PRIVATE.

00:41:44.602 --> 00:41:46.036
TO THOSE OF THE MAJOR CONCERNS

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:47.438
WE HAVE NOW LET ME CLOSE BY

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:49.240
SAYING THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:50.908
WHEEL SYSTEM.

00:41:50.975 --> 00:41:52.910
THE WE IS SYSTEM IS THE ONLY

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:55.112
SYSTEM THAT IS AN OPT OUT SYSTEM

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:56.614
IN OTHER WORDS.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.749
EVERYBODY'S IN UNLESS YOU

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:00.784
ACTIVELY TURN WE ARE OFF ON YOUR

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.253
WIRELESS DEVICE.

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.321
THERE IS NO DATA AND NO EVIDENCE

00:42:04.388 --> 00:42:05.522
TO SUGGEST THAT THE WE HAVE

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.224
SYSTEM HAS FAILED DURING ANY OF

00:42:07.291 --> 00:42:08.993
THESE EMERGENCIES WHEN IT HAS

00:42:09.059 --> 00:42:10.461
BEEN USED.

00:42:10.527 --> 00:42:12.830
LAST YEAR ALL OF YOU SUPPORTED

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.899

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.267
SENATOR.

00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:17.167
MCGUIRE.

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:21.605
THAT AND EVERY COMMUNITY CITY

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:23.107
COUNTY WHOEVER THE ALERT DOES

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:25.776
IGNEOUS SHOULD BE SIGNED UP FOR

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:26.644
WE ARE.

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.579
AND SHOULD HAVE TRAINING ON HOW

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:29.647
TO IMPLEMENT WE ARE.

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.348
IN A DISASTER BECAUSE IT IS THE

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.317
BEST MOST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM IN

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:35.185
FACT THE WE A SYSTEM ACTUALLY

00:42:35.252 --> 00:42:38.522
CAPTURES YOUR WIRELESS DEVICE IF

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.624
YOU'RE VISITING AN AREA SO WE

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:41.959

SO IT'S A VERY EFFECTIVE OFTEN

00:42:49.033 --> 00:42:50.167
AS ONE OF THE WITNESSES JUST

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.937

AUTOMATICALLY A 100% AGAIN

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.049
UNLESS YOU'VE TURNED IT OFF.

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:05.916

YEARS AGO BECAUSE IT WAS A

00:43:12.089 --> 00:43:14.291
LIMITATION ON THE TECHNOLOGY WE

AND SIXTY CHARACTERS.

00:43:21.031 --> 00:43:22.666
SO THE SYSTEM IS BEING IMPROVED

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:24.702
WE'RE INVESTING IN IN MAKING

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.136

00:47:20.938 --> 00:47:22.039
THREAT.

00:47:22.105 --> 00:47:23.907
THE GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE THE

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.476
SYSTEM WORK BETTER AND SO THE

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:28.378
ACCOUNTABILITY ASPECTS OF REALLY

00:47:28.445 --> 00:47:30.280
WITHIN THE SYSTEM ITSELF AND NOT

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:32.316
ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY OR ANY

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.617
PARTICULAR LOCATION SO I'M.

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:36.086
COURSE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:47:36.153 --> 00:47:37.788
TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL BECAUSE THE

00:47:37.854 --> 00:47:40.324
GOAL IS TO HAVE REDUNDANCY TO

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.825
HAVE AS MANY DIFFERENTWAYS TO

00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:44.528

00:47:44.595 --> 00:47:46.797
IT AS ACCURATE AS POSSIBLE AND

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.298
TO MAKE SURE IT'S CONSISTENT SO

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.366
THAT.

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.668
WHEN SOME PEOPLE GET A LOCAL

00:47:51.735 --> 00:47:53.570
WARNING AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T WE

00:47:53.637 --> 00:47:55.138
NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHY THAT IS

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.873
THAT THAT ISN'T HAPPENING?

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.342
BY AGGREGATING THE INFORMATION

00:47:58.408 --> 00:48:00.477
NOT DESEGREGAING WE ARE NOT

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:01.778
GOING TO BE IDENTIFYING A

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.982
PARTICULAR COMPANY OR PROCESS

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:06.416
THAT MAY BE --

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.452
IN NEED OF IMPROVEMENT IT'S THE

00:48:08.518 --> 00:48:10.254
OVERALL VIEW OF HOW WE MAKE THE

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.022
SYSTEM BETTER SO WE CAN HAPPY TO

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:16.860

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:20.597
AS FAR AS THE ONE OTHER.

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:23.433
QUESTION ON WEBSITE AND THE

00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:24.735
WEBSITE RIGHT --

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:27.571
AGAIN THE INFORMATION IS NOT.

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:30.474
SUPPOSED TO BE SPECIFIC.

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:32.142
SO THAT IT COULD BE USED IN AN

00:48:32.209 --> 00:48:33.944
ADVERSE WAY --

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:35.078
BY.

00:48:35.145 --> 00:48:37.114
TERRORISTS OR WHAT OTHER

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.882
OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT EXIST IN

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:41.852
TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY WORLD OR IN

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:43.353
VIOLATION OF PRIVACY ISSUE SO

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.389
AGAIN HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING

00:48:45.455 --> 00:48:46.089
ON THAT.

00:48:46.156 --> 00:48:48.558
THE GOAL IS TO GET REDUNDANCY.

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:49.993
THERE WAS MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:51.161
AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM

00:48:51.228 --> 00:48:53.130
CONSISTENT TO MAKE THEM AFFECT

00:48:53.196 --> 00:48:54.298
THEM TO MAKE THEM.

00:48:54.364 --> 00:48:57.534
AS EARLY AND AS CLEAR AS

00:48:57.601 --> 00:48:59.836
POSSIBLE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN

00:48:59.903 --> 00:49:02.039
RESPOND AND BE SAFE THAT IS THE

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.573
GOAL SO AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:06.009
CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT AS WELL

00:49:06.076 --> 00:49:08.111
THANK YOU [inaudible]

THE VICE CHAIRMAN.

00:49:11.281 --> 00:49:12.916
OF I THINK YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED --

00:49:12.983 --> 00:49:14.051
MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:15.686
POSED TO YOU BUT I FEEL

00:49:15.752 --> 00:49:16.987
OBLIGATED BECAUSE THERE WERE

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.456
SOME FAIRLY COMPELLING POINTS ON

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:21.158
THAT WERE BROUGHT UP BY AN OF

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:22.159
FOLKS THAT --

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:26.430
HAD CONCERNS WITH IF.

00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:28.498
SECTIONS FOUR AND FIVE WERE

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:31.134
REVISED TO THEIR SATISFACTION

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.003
WITH THIS STILL IN YOUR OPINION.

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:35.872
MOVE -- THIS --

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.407
SAFETY SYSTEM --

00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.176
TOWARD --

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:40.644
IMPROVED VIABLE STATE.

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:42.245
WELL IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT THE

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:44.648
FINAL SATISFACTION ELEMENT IS SO

00:49:44.715 --> 00:49:45.949
I CAN CERTAINLY COMMITTED TO

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.651
WORKING WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THE

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.486
ISSUES THAT WERE ARTICULATED ONE

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:50.420
OF THEM.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.422
THE P. YOU SEE VERSUS THE OFFICE

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:54.391
OF EMERGENCY SERVICES RIGHT NOW

00:49:54.458 --> 00:49:55.225
NOBODY THAT I KNOW WAS

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.928
PARTICULARLY HIGH ON THE PC SO

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.596
THAT MAY VERY WELL BE.

00:49:59.663 --> 00:50:01.298
AN AVENUE TO PURSUE I'VE NO

00:50:01.365 --> 00:50:03.100
PROBLEM HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:05.035
AND SO LONG AS WE'RE ALL WORKING

00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.470
IN GOOD FAITH I THINK WE CAN

00:50:06.536 --> 00:50:07.971
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION HERE

00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:09.339
AGAIN MY GOAL.

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:11.274
IS REPETITIVE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.542
GOING TO REACH EVERYBODY AS

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.244
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GIVE THEM

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.480
THE NECESSARY INFORMATION WE A

00:50:16.546 --> 00:50:18.281
IT IS A GREAT SYSTEM BUT IT ONLY

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.217
SEE IT IT DOESN'T MEET ALL OF

00:50:20.283 --> 00:50:20.917
THE NEEDS.

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:24.221
AND AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE.

00:50:24.287 --> 00:50:27.858
A BETTER MORE ROBUST WIRELESS

00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:29.626
THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE IT MORE

00:50:29.693 --> 00:50:31.294
ROBUST AND ALSO TO DEAL WITH THE

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:32.629
CONCERNS.

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.531
THAT THEY HAVE ABOUT THE OR THAT

00:50:34.598 --> 00:50:36.400
WERE ARTICULATED HERE TODAY OVER

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:37.734
THOSE SECTIONS MAYBE I'LL POSE

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:39.269
MY QUESTION TO MR DEVINE YOU

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:41.138
BROUGHT UP BUT AS YOUR THIRD

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:42.606
POINT --

00:50:42.672 --> 00:50:43.940
CONFIDENTIALITY MAINTAINING.

00:50:44.007 --> 00:50:45.242
THE INTEGRITY OF PROPRIETARY

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:46.877
INFORMATION OR NATIONAL SECURITY

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:48.378
CONCERNS WITHIN THE GRID THE

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:52.282
FRAMEWORK OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS --

00:50:52.349 --> 00:50:54.584
CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT ON

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:57.421
HOW YOU WOULD WORK WITH --

00:50:57.487 --> 00:50:59.222
THE MAKER OF THIS ITEM TO

00:50:59.289 --> 00:51:01.525
PROTECT ALL INFORMATION THAT YOU

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:04.094
DEEM SENSITIVE.

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.095
FIRST OFF WE'D BE DELIGHTED TO

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:06.463
WORK WITH THE SENATOR ON THAT

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.165
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:12.402
AND THE IT WE ALREADY HAVE TODAY

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:13.637
PRACTICE WITH --

00:51:13.703 --> 00:51:16.406
AGENCIES WHERE THEY DO ASK FOR

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:18.041
AND DO RECEIVE HIGHLY

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:19.543
PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:21.411
INFORMATION HOMELAND SECURITY

00:51:21.478 --> 00:51:23.447
AND NETWORK SECURITY ISSUES THAT

00:51:23.513 --> 00:51:24.414
WE PROVIDE TO THE STATE

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.382
GOVERNMENT WOULD MAKE THOSE

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:26.683
REPORTS AVAILABLE.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.151
AND THEY'RE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:30.487
AND THAT IS HONORED AND AS LONG

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:32.322
AS THAT'S BUILT INTO THE BILL --

00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.924
THAT WOULD ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS.

00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:36.193
HOWEVER I IF I MAY MISTER

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:39.262
CHAIRMAN ONE OTHER OBSERVATION.

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:43.633
THE DATA THIS BILL ASKS FOR ESOS

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.634
TO GIVE WHETHER IT'S TO P. YOU

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:44.935
SEE HERE --

00:51:45.001 --> 00:51:46.236
YES AND BY THE WAY THANK YOU FOR

00:51:46.303 --> 00:51:48.672
CAN.

00:51:48.738 --> 00:51:52.909
WE DO NOT WORTH THE DISCUSSION.

00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:57.347
WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA.

00:51:57.414 --> 00:52:01.084
WE DO NOT HAVE THE DATA.

00:52:01.151 --> 00:52:03.153
IT IS INITIATED BY LOCAL

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.256
RESPONDERS.

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:08.959
CITIES COUNTIES OR DESIGNEES.

00:52:09.025 --> 00:52:10.760
SO WHEN THAT DATA GOES ACROSS

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:11.862
THE NETWORK.

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.296
WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED IT WE DON'T

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:14.898
KNOW WHAT SENSE.

00:52:14.965 --> 00:52:16.433
WE DON'T WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.001
ANY DATA THAT WE COULD SUBMIT

00:52:18.068 --> 00:52:19.736
HERE SO THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS A

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.505
STATUTE REQUIRING US TO GIVES

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:22.439
GOVERNMENT DATA.

00:52:22.506 --> 00:52:24.040
WHEN IN FACT WE DON'T COLLECT

00:52:24.107 --> 00:52:25.008
THE DATA?

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:27.711
SO THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE

00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:29.479
THAT -- AND

00:52:29.546 --> 00:52:30.747
I MIGHT ADD THAT WAS THE OTHER

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:32.015
THING IS THE FACT THAT THE

00:52:32.082 --> 00:52:33.817
SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY DARN WELL

00:52:33.884 --> 00:52:35.685
AND ALERTS DO GO OUT.

00:52:35.752 --> 00:52:37.721
AND LET ME STOP THERE THANK YOU

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:38.855
VERY MUCH.

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:39.289
ARE -- ALL

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.091
THE ALL THE ALL FINISH WITH THIS

00:52:41.157 --> 00:52:43.827
THAT -- FROM

00:52:43.894 --> 00:52:45.028
NINETEEN THE THREE SIXTY WHICH I

00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:46.997
THINK MAY HAVE --

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:48.431
ADDRESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT

00:52:48.498 --> 00:52:50.033
THE MAKER THE ITEM HAD PUT

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:51.434
FORWARD AND ON NOT ENOUGH

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.502
INFORMATION.

00:52:52.569 --> 00:52:53.670
THE RESPONSIVENESS IN THE

00:52:53.737 --> 00:52:55.906
ABILITY TO RESPOND THAT'S TO BE

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.574
DETERMINED BUT ULTIMATELY.

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.010
I WANNA MAKE CERTAIN THAT --

00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:00.744
BY WILL TO ME BY WAY OF

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:01.845
BACKGROUND IN MY PREVIOUS

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:04.414
CAPACITY IS SUPERVISOR WE ARE

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:05.815
SHOOTING A DOWNTOWN FRESNO.

00:53:05.882 --> 00:53:07.684
AND I WAS --

00:53:07.751 --> 00:53:08.919
TASKED WITH THE CREATING

00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:11.054
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROTOCOLS

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.522
WITHIN THE COUNTING I WAS

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.457
FLABBERGASTED.

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.892
AND HOW ILL EQUIPPED WE WERE TO

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.461
HANDLE A SITUATION LIKE THAT.

00:53:18.528 --> 00:53:19.896
AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.031
INSTITUTING --

00:53:21.097 --> 00:53:23.166
REFORMS ON DONE TOWARD IMPROVING

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:23.767
THAT.

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.268
PUBLIC AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.504
SAFETY -- SO

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:28.772
I APPRECIATE THE MAKER THIS ITEM

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:31.308
MOVING THIS FORWARD I THINK.

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:33.043
GIVEN WHAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED

00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:35.045
THIS IS THE RIGHT PATH AS LONG

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.280
AS WE FIND A WAY THAT PROTECTS

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:39.482
INFORMATION THAT CREATES PREPARE

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.084
THE DOES NOT UNFAIRLY CREE

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:43.720
PRESUMPTIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY.

00:53:43.787 --> 00:53:45.555
ALL THAT CAN BE WORKED AROUND

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:46.256
THEN I THINK THERE'S A PATH

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:48.458
FORWARD AS LONG AS THE

00:53:48.525 --> 00:53:51.027
PREVAILING PARTIES --

00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:54.731
COME TO AGREEMENT [inaudible]

00:53:54.798 --> 00:53:55.565
BETTER GALGIANI.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:56.700
I HAD A COMMENT AND THEN I HAD A

00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:58.768
QUESTION IN MY OWN HOME COUNTY I

00:53:58.835 --> 00:54:01.204
RECEIVE AN EMERGENCY TEXT ALERT

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:03.173
AND I ALSO RECEIVE AN EMAIL.

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.674
AND I THINK IT WORKS WONDERFUL

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.943
WHEN I'M OUT ON MISTER DEVINE

00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:08.645
MENTIONED THAT THAT WE A SYSTEM

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:10.714
HAS A CAPTURE THE CAPTURE YOUR

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.415
WIRELESS DEVICE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:13.550
VISITING AN AREA.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:15.285

PARADISE SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRES

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.256
WHEN THEY HAD THE FLOOD WATCH

00:54:20.323 --> 00:54:21.124
WARNING.

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:25.362
AND I RECEIVED AN ALERT I

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:26.730
ASSUMED IT WAS A TAXED AND SO I

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:27.931
WENT TO OPEN IT AND IT

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:29.366
DISAPPEARED.

00:54:29.432 --> 00:54:31.301
I THINK IT DISAPPEARED AND THEN

00:54:31.368 --> 00:54:33.403
I I GOT ANOTHER ALERT ON MY

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.838
OTHER CELL PHONE I COULD HEAR

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:35.905

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:55.525
IF I USE THAT LANGUAGE --

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:56.526
I THINK IT WAS --

00:54:56.593 --> 00:55:00.530
IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

00:55:00.597 --> 00:55:01.731

THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF THIS

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.739
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:11.241
PHONES ARE RECEIVING THE SIGNAL

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.609

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:22.519
THINKING IT WAS A CONVENTIONAL

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:24.587
TAXED IT CLEARED IT FROM THE

00:55:24.654 --> 00:55:25.855
DEVICES MEMORY.

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:28.058
THE DEVICES DO NOT SAVE THESE

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.359

BASIS OF THAT.

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.154
IS -- WAY

00:58:45.221 --> 00:58:48.958
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ONCE YOU

GONNA THE THE SOMEBODY HAS A HAS

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.935
BEEN A KIDNAP.

00:58:59.002 --> 00:59:02.305
AND THE LAW ENFORCEMENT SAYS

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:02.839
OKAY I WANT THAT NUMBER TO

00:59:02.906 --> 00:59:04.173
PAYING IT --

CAN THEY GET THAT NUMBER WITHOUT

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:09.145
LEGAL PROCESS SO THAT'S OUR

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:12.148
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:14.050
THAT KIND OF A POPPING UP

00:59:14.117 --> 00:59:15.752
AGAINST THAT CENTER JACKSON WELL

00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:17.420
I APPRECIATE THAT BUT AGAIN.

00:59:17.487 --> 00:59:19.856
THE THE BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC AS

00:59:19.923 --> 00:59:21.925
TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE USE OF

00:59:21.991 --> 00:59:23.393
THIS INFORMATION ONLY FOR

00:59:23.459 --> 00:59:25.862
EMERGENCY PURPOSES AND I WOULD.

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.497
ARGUE THAT LEGAL PROCESS IS

00:59:27.563 --> 00:59:29.299
PASSING LEGISLATION THAT CREATES

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:31.868
THAT ABILITY BUT LIMITED BECAUSE

00:59:31.935 --> 00:59:33.937
I THINK THE CONCERNS HAVE TO DO

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:35.004
WITH WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:59:35.071 --> 00:59:36.973
INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED.

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:38.107
FOR OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:40.043
REQUIREMENTS AND NACHOS FOR THE

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.577
LIMITED PURPOSE LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:59:41.644 --> 00:59:42.745
IS TASKED IN THE STATE OF

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:44.714
CALIFORNIA TO DO THAT FIRST

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:45.848
RESPONSE.

00:59:45.915 --> 00:59:47.750
IN CASES OF EMERGENCY THAT IS

00:59:47.817 --> 00:59:49.252
THEIR JOB.

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:51.921
AND THIS LEGISLATION SPECIFIES

00:59:51.988 --> 00:59:54.324
AND LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO USE

00:59:54.390 --> 00:59:55.458
THAT INFORMATION TO OUR WHICH

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:57.293
MAYBE IT'S MAYBE IT'S A GOOD

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:57.894
COURT CASE WILL HAVE SOME FUN

00:59:57.961 --> 00:59:58.394
OVERNIGHT.

00:59:58.461 --> 01:00:00.463
I THINK RIGHT NOW THAT THAT IS

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.864
THE LIMITATION A AND IT'S VERY

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.399
SPECIFIC.

01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:04.600
AS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH IT I

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:05.601
THINK THE LEGAL PROCESS ARE

01:00:05.668 --> 01:00:07.470
TALKING ABOUT IS A SEARCH

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:10.073
WARRANT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT --

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:12.575
THAT MAY BE AND THAT'S WHY C.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:13.977
ALERTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:00:14.043 --> 01:00:15.611
SERVING PROCESS SERVING A

01:00:15.678 --> 01:00:17.246
WARRANT MAKING AN ARREST.

01:00:17.313 --> 01:00:19.182
IT'S SIMPLY TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:21.584
ONE SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITY THAT

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:23.619
pCALIFORNIA GIVEN TO LAW

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.488
ENFORCEMENT.

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:27.123
WHETHER IT'S A THE VICTIM

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.791
SENDING OUT THAT GETTING THAT

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.693
INFORMATION AND AGAIN --

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.195
THIS MAY BE A PHILOSOPHICAL

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:34.397
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK GIVEN THE

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.765
RESPONSIBILITIES OF LAW

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.066
ENFORCEMENT AND WE ALREADY DID

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:38.601
THIS WITH THIS BE A TWENTY ONE

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:39.936
AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE SEEN ANY

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.471
LAWSUITS THUS FAR.

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:42.972
I SUSPECT THAT NO ONE REALLY

01:00:43.039 --> 01:00:44.440
WANTS TO BRING THOSE LOSSES

01:00:44.507 --> 01:00:47.310
BECAUSE YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN T. AND

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.544
AND ALL OF THESE WIRELESS

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:49.412
COMPANIES THEY DO BUSINESS HERE

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.413

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.248
MONEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY

SERVE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:55.518
AND I WOULD THINK THAT THIS IS

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:56.753
SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD WANT

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.021

MAKE IT CONFIDENTIAL AFTER THE

01:02:29.345 --> 01:02:31.347

HAVE HAVEN'T BEEN VETTED.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:59.075
BUT AGAIN THE BASIC PURPOSE OF

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:01.844
THIS BILL IS TO IMPROVE THE

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:04.313

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:10.553
REDUNDANCY TO BETTER TARGET.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.188
BECAUSE WE A DOZEN TO THAT AS

BLOCK I DON'T THINK WE WILL

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.440
BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED I THINK

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:33.142
THAT THE WIRELESS COMPANIES

01:03:33.209 --> 01:03:34.644

AND THAT IS A SERIOUS CONCERN

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.699
BUT AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.301
FOCUSING ON WHAT TO DO TO GIVE

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:39.969
GREATER WARNINGS TO PEOPLE IN

01:05:40.036 --> 01:05:41.604
EMERGENCIES WE KEEP SEEING THEM

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:42.305
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:43.839
CALIFORNIA IN YOUR DISTRICT AS

A CHANCE TO GET OUT SAFELY SO

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.079
THAT THEY'RE NOT ANOTHER ONE OF

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.914
THE STATISTICS OF THE HUNDRED

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:53.349
OVER HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE WERE

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.217
KILLED IN THESE FIRES THE TWENTY

THREE PEOPLE KILLED IN MY

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:57.453
DISTRICT FROM THE DEBRIS FLOW

01:05:57.520 --> 01:05:58.654
THAT OCCURRED.

01:05:58.721 --> 01:05:59.989
RIGHT AFTER FIR AND IT GOES ON

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:03.559
AND ON CHANGES WE SEE THE

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:04.994
INTENSITY OF THE WEATHER

01:06:05.061 --> 01:06:06.696
PATTERNS CREATING GREATER AND

01:06:06.762 --> 01:06:08.064

IN THIS IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

01:06:11.867 --> 01:06:13.235
WE CAN DO THAT AND SO AGAIN

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:14.970
WORKING TO CREATE THE

01:06:15.037 --> 01:06:17.073

BIT OF DISCONNECT IN TERMS OF

01:06:43.065 --> 01:06:44.700
THE ISSUES RAISED HERE AND THE

CONFIDENTIALITY OF MATERIAL OF

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.036
OF OF INFORMATION AT THE PUBLIC

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.671
UTILITIES COMMISSION ESPECIALLY.

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.141

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.677
HASN'T ENDED IN THOSE STATES IT

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.912
WORKS JUST FINE.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:45.881
MY LIFE IS A MAJOR ECONOMIC

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.183
DRIVER IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.319
HUGE EMPLOYER --

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:51.720
IT IS A HUGE --

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.856
SOURCE OF TAX REVENUE --

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:56.358
IT'S A HUGE SOURCE OF ECONOMIC

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:59.528
NOW PARTICULARLY IN OUR MAJOR

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.829
CITIES ARE TOURIST CENTERS

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:03.298
CALIFORNIA HAS PLACED ITSELF AT

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:05.968
A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE --

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:06.501
BY HAVING --

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.203
WHITE IN THE BIG SCHEME OF

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:12.007
THINGS IS AN EARLY CLOSING TIME --

01:15:12.074 --> 01:15:12.708
DESTROYED CLOSING TIME ALSO DOES

01:15:12.774 --> 01:15:14.676
NOT RECOGNIZE THAT NOT EVERYONE

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:17.746
WORKS AND NINE TO FIVE JOB AND

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:19.448
GOES TO BED AT TEN OR ELEVEN AT

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:20.215
NIGHT.

01:15:20.282 --> 01:15:21.917
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:23.285
DON'T EVEN GET OFF WORK.

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:24.987
UNTIL MIDNIGHT AND WE BASICALLY

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.722
TOLD THOSE PEOPLE YOU'RE NOT

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:27.990
ALLOWED TO GO OUT.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:28.790
BECAUSE BY THE TIME THEY GET

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.993
HOME CHANGE GO OUT AGAIN IT'S

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:33.896
ALREADY ONE THIRTY AND THINGS

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:36.164
ARE WINDING DOWN.

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.866
SO THIS BILL ALIGNS US WITH BEST

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.534
PRACTICES IN OTHER STATES.

01:15:39.601 --> 01:15:41.270
THE BILL HAS SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:43.305
SAFETY SAFEGUARDS AND IT WE

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.873
WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH

01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:46.642
STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:47.976
IS OUR THIRD --

01:15:48.043 --> 01:15:50.178
TIME AT THE RODEO ON THIS THE

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:51.480
GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL LAST

01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:52.214
YEAR.

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:53.415
WE NOW HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:53.916
SERVER TRYING AGAIN --

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.517
WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:58.153
STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT --

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.454
TO PUT GUARD RAILS ON THE BILL.

01:15:59.521 --> 01:16:01.590
THIS IS IN A SITUATION WORK CITY

01:16:01.657 --> 01:16:05.193
CAN TO SAY IF A CITY THE SIZE

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.395
THAT IT MIGHT WANT TO DO IT.

01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:09.031
THE CITY FIRST HAS TO CONVENE A

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:12.200
COMMUNITY TASK FORCE TO GO OVER

01:16:12.267 --> 01:16:12.601
THE ISSUE AND MAKE

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:13.535
RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:16.204
THAT TASK FORCE MUST INCLUDE

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.240
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND C. H.

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:21.543
P. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. FIVE

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.345
THE CITY COUNCIL ALSO HAS TO

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:26.181
FORMULATE A PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN.

01:16:26.248 --> 01:16:27.582
AND THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO

01:16:27.649 --> 01:16:29.885
ENSURE SAFETY.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.387
BY THE CITY COUNCIL THEN HAS TO

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.423
PASS AN ORDINANCE BASED ON THOSE

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:36.658
PLANS.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:39.328
AND THAT PLAN THAT GETS

01:16:39.394 --> 01:16:41.596
SUBMITTED TO THE ABC FOR REVIEW

01:16:41.663 --> 01:16:43.398
TO MAKE SURE THAT A COMPLY.

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.834
AND ONCE A. B. C. CERTIFIES THAT

01:16:45.901 --> 01:16:46.435
THEY'VE DONE WHAT THEY NEED TO

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:47.502
DO.

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.870
THAT'S JUST THE FIRST STEP

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.106
BECAUSE THE NEXT STEP IS THAT

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:53.208
ANY ESTABLISHMENT THAT WANTS TO

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:54.376
EXTEND ITS HOURS.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.745
HAS TO THEN APPLY TO BBC FOR

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:57.879
THAT EXTENSION.

01:16:57.946 --> 01:16:59.614
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU WOULD

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.083
APPLY FOR A LIQUOR LICENSE YOU

01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:02.584
HAVE TO APPLY THEY DO AN

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:04.486
INVESTIGATION NEIGHBORS HAVE AN

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:06.755
OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT EXPRESS

01:17:06.822 --> 01:17:08.423
OBJECTIONS ARE SUPPORT.

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.025
THERE IS AN APPEAL PROCESS.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:14.496
SO THIS IS A VERY VERY ORIENTED

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:15.697
APPROACH.

01:17:15.764 --> 01:17:18.266
IN ADDITION CITIES ARE NOT

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:20.168
REQUIRED SIGN ON SWITCH OFF

01:17:20.235 --> 01:17:21.003
SWITCH -- I

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:22.771
I DOUBT THAT ANY CITY WOULD

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.039
APPLY THIS TO THE WHOLE CITY

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.240
THEY KIND OF THEY WANT BUT IT'S

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.341
UNLIKELY.

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:29.011
A CITY CAN LIMITED TO ONE ST.

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:30.879
OR ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:32.581
ENTERTAINMENT ZONE I CITY CAN

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.149
SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT SEVEN

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.951
NIGHTS A WEEK WERE ONLY DOING A

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:37.686
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHTS OR A

01:17:37.753 --> 01:17:39.588
CITY CAN SAY WE'RE ONLY DOING

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:41.089
THIS ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A YEAR.

01:17:41.156 --> 01:17:43.158
FOR SPECIAL EVENTS --

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.926
SO CITIES WILL HAVE ENORMOUS

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:46.495
FLEXIBILITY IN DECIDING.

01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:50.298
WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE AND IF SO.

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:51.933
IN WHAT FORM.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:52.901
HI I DO WANT TO ADDRESS BECAUSE

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:53.402
I KNOW --

01:17:53.468 --> 01:17:55.737
EVERY TIME WE RAISES BUILDERS

01:17:55.804 --> 01:17:57.639
DISCUSSION ABOUT --

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:59.708
DRUNK DRIVING ABOUT THE WISE AND

01:17:59.775 --> 01:18:01.109
AS I HAVE MENTIONED THIS TO THIS

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:02.077
COMMITTEE --

01:18:02.144 --> 01:18:04.179
BOTH IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:04.913
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHEN I WAS HERE

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.948
ON THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:09.084
FOR ME BECAUSE WHEN I WAS A

01:18:09.151 --> 01:18:11.420
CHILD IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES MY

01:18:11.486 --> 01:18:12.521
AUNT.

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:14.122
MY FATHER'S ONLY SISTER WAS

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.657
KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER.

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.491
AND THIS IS DURING THE TIME

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.493
PERIOD ONE LAWS AROUND DRUNK

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.362
DRIVING WERE INADEQUATE --

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:21.496
THERE WERE NO THEY'RE ALMOST NO

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:24.566
CONSEQUENCES ARE FOR THIS PERSON.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.068
AND SO THIS IS A PERSONAL ISSUE

01:18:26.134 --> 01:18:28.670
FOR ME I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO I

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.605
WOULD NOT POSE A BILL IF I

01:18:30.672 --> 01:18:31.239
THOUGHT IT WOULD INCREASED DRUNK

01:18:31.306 --> 01:18:31.840
DRIVING.

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:33.642
AND THE REALITY IS THAT DESPITE

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:34.509
SOME OF THE COMMON TO HEAR FROM

01:18:34.576 --> 01:18:36.445
OPPONENTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:39.648
DATA THERE IS NO DATA INDICATING.

01:18:39.714 --> 01:18:40.649
THAT LATER CLOSING TIME

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:43.852
INCREASES WE HAVE --

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:45.887
COMPARED ALL FIFTY STATES

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:48.790
CLOSING TIMES VERSES RATES OF

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:50.859
THE Y. COLLISIONS THERE IS NO

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:53.161
CORRELATION --

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:55.297
SO THERE UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.699
PEOPLE WHO WHETHER YOU CLOSE THE

01:18:57.766 --> 01:19:00.168
BARS AT TEN PM MIDNIGHT TO I AM

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:02.070
OR FOUR AM THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:03.638
WHO ARE GOING TO LEAVE TRONG AND

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:06.174
THEIR CAR AND AS HORRIBLE.

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:06.808
THEY NEED TO BE CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:07.576
THAT -- BUT

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:09.744
IT DOES NOT DEPEND ON WHEN.

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:13.215
THE BARS CLOSE.

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:16.451
SO COLLEAGUES OUT THIS IS A I I

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.353
THINK THAT THIS IS A A BILL

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:20.789
WHOSE TIME HAS COME. TO GIVE OUR

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:22.524
COMMUNITIES WHAT WERE NIGHT LIFE

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.559
IS SO IMPORTANT CULTURALLY AND

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:27.295
ECONOMICALLY. TO GIVE PEOPLE AN

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:29.264
CITIES THE OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:30.665
TAILOR THEIR NIGHT LIFE O THE

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:31.967
NEEDS OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:33.568
TO DO AND A FIVE YEAR PILOT

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.469

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:36.371
THAT WILL EXPIRE AFTER FIVE

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.106
YEARS IF WE DON'T EXTEND THAT WE

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.774
CAN SEE HOW IT WORKS.

01:19:39.841 --> 01:19:43.945
AND THEN TAKE IT OUT FROM THERE --

01:19:44.012 --> 01:19:45.080
AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO LEAVE

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:45.714
YOU WITH YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.516
TRANSPORTATION --

01:19:47.582 --> 01:19:48.950
EVER WHEN I FIRST STARTED GOING

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:51.319
OUT WHEN I WAS MUCH YOUNGER --

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:54.122
IT WAS YOU KNOW PEOPLE THROW

01:19:54.189 --> 01:19:55.357

TODAY IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC

01:19:56.525 --> 01:19:59.327
TRANSPORTATION IN SOME AREAS AND

01:19:59.394 --> 01:20:00.629
FOUR AM BY THE WAY IS A LOT

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:03.331
CLOSER. TO THE OPENING OF PUBLIC

01:20:03.398 --> 01:20:05.367

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.081
HAVING TO DRIVE --

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:20.549
SO GOD COLLEAGUES --

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:23.552

AS AN ADULT I KNOW I NOW

TODAY I STAND IN OPPOSITION OF

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.212
SB FIFTY EIGHT SINCE STUDIES

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.581
CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASE

01:28:41.749 --> 01:28:42.817

01:28:42.884 --> 01:28:44.585
AND AN INCREASE ALCOHOL RELATED

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:50.892
THE CLAIM THAT NIGHT LIFE IS

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:53.594

WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT --

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:49.510

01:40:57.851 --> 01:40:59.820
TRANSPORTATION PLAN --

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:01.989
