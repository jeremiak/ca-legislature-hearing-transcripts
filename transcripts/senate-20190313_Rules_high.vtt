00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.940
HUMAN RIGHT.

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:15.341
THE VESSEL JUST CONTEXTUALLY I

00:06:15.408 --> 00:06:16.709
MEAN IT'S KIND OF AMAZING THAT

00:06:16.776 --> 00:06:18.611
IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND AND

00:06:18.678 --> 00:06:19.879
MARLEY SHOCKING THAT WE WOULD

00:06:19.946 --> 00:06:21.547
HAVE A MILLION PEOPLE IN THE

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:22.815
STATE AS WEALTHY AS OZ THAT

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:24.951
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE AND

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.385
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER SO.

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.454
IT'S BOTH AND URBAN AND THE

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.056
RURAL PROBLEM --

00:06:30.123 --> 00:06:33.025
IT IT IS FROM BOTH HISTORIC --

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:36.129
CONTAMINATION NITRATES AS WELL

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:37.997
AS NATURALLY OCCURRING --

00:06:38.064 --> 00:06:40.032
SUBSTANCES LIKE ARSENIC IN

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.934
URANIUM SO IT RUNS THE GAMUT AND

00:06:42.001 --> 00:06:44.504
AND REALLY THE GENESIS OF THE

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.638
PROBLEM IS THAT --

00:06:45.705 --> 00:06:47.373
THE FACILITY THAT WE NEED IN

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.775
ORDER TO CLEAN THE WATER TO MAKE

00:06:48.841 --> 00:06:50.676
IT SUITABLE PHùFOR DRINKING A

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:52.278
VERY VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:53.412
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.782
PROVIDES THE STATE WITH MONEY

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.083
THAT ALLOWS US TO BUILD

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.417
INFRASTRUCTURE BUT WE DON'T HAVE

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.253

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.088
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE.

00:10:41.741 --> 00:10:42.875
AS BUSINESSES AND THE REST OF

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.378
THE STATE.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:46.612
THE THE LAST ELEMENT THAT I

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:47.880
WOULD SAY IS REALLY MAKING SURE

BEING ON THE POLITICAL MARGINS

00:10:59.125 --> 00:11:02.061
AND ON THOSE MARGINS WE NEED TO

00:11:02.128 --> 00:11:03.396
BRING PEOPLE INTO THIS AND

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:04.797
ENCOURAGE THEM.

00:11:04.864 --> 00:11:06.999

FARMERS AND FARM WORKERS COME

00:14:27.132 --> 00:14:29.068
TOGETHER AND COME OUT WITH THESE

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:29.368
SOLUTIONS.

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:30.936

BECAUSE AS WE FOUND OUT THIS IS

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:49.054
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE.

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:52.091
EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE TO FIX --

00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:55.027
AND WILL ALSO NEED TO SHOWN THE

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:56.061

THE HOUSING --

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:20.419

LAWSUITS WHICH CURRENTLY CAN BE

00:15:39.071 --> 00:15:40.639
FILED ANONYMOUSLY.

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.541
ARE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:44.276
NOT BE ALWAYS BASED IN THE

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.778
COMMUNITY --

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.046
WHERE THE IMPACTS ARE HAPPENING

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:49.481
IT CAN BE OUTSIDE AGENCIES FOR

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:50.783
WHATEVER PURPOSE WE WOULD HOPE

00:15:50.849 --> 00:15:52.217
IT'S ENVIRONMENTAL BUT MANY

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:54.119
TIMES WE FOUND THAT IT'S NOT

00:15:54.186 --> 00:15:56.522
NECESSARILY THAT SO COULD YOU?

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:58.624

ON THAT HAVING SERVED IN ALL

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.027
WHEN AGENCY THAT DOESN'T ALLOW

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:05.497
IT AND COMING TO ANOTHER ONE

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.033
THAT THAT STILL DOES.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.468
YEAH I'M I'M NOT FLUENT ENOUGH --

00:16:09.535 --> 00:16:10.202
TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:12.037
GENESIS OF WHY ONE SYSTEM HAS

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:13.839
AND A NUMBER THE MAYBE IT'S A

00:16:13.906 --> 00:16:14.807
WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS ON

00:16:14.873 --> 00:16:16.275
OPTIONAL WHAT THE THE REASONS

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:17.710
ARE BACK.

00:16:17.776 --> 00:16:20.446
DOZEN TIMES OF THESE ACTS WHICH

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:22.014
GET A LOT OF ATTENTION RELIEF

00:16:22.081 --> 00:16:24.216
FOR ME THE THE MAN GOAL IS IS

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:25.417
TO LOOK AT ENVIRONMENTAL

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:26.885
TENTATIVE --

00:16:26.952 --> 00:16:28.020
AND THEY'VE YOU KNOW THEY'VE

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:29.521
MORPHED INTO DIFFERENT THINGS

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:31.457
OVER TIME BUT THE REAL GOAL IS

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:31.990
TO SAY.

00:16:32.057 --> 00:16:33.225
THIS IS THE PROPOSED PROJECT

00:16:33.292 --> 00:16:35.327

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON THAT

00:16:37.696 --> 00:16:40.165
PROJECT AND IS THERE AN ABILITY

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.000
TO COME OUT WITH A CLEAR SIGHTED

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:45.170
VIEW OF ALTERNATIVES AND TO ME

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:47.639
THAT'S THE THE ROOT OF BOTH THE

00:16:47.706 --> 00:16:48.841
NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:50.509
ACT AND AND SEA QUEST.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:54.947
AND YET AS ACTIVITY I TOLD ABOUT

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:56.849

HOME BUILDERS.

00:16:58.083 --> 00:16:59.718
AND ORGANIZED LABOR AND

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:00.986
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO LOOK AT

00:17:01.053 --> 00:17:02.955

00:17:09.027 --> 00:17:10.396
IN TRYING TO MEET THOSE TWIN

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:12.331
GOALS -- I

00:17:12.398 --> 00:17:15.033

CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WAS A

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:58.123
PRECURSOR TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT

00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:59.858

THE LA BASIN HAD SUCH POOR AIR

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:02.861

LOOKING AT WHAT WE CAN DO. TO TO

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.688
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:21:29.755 --> 00:21:31.790
LET'S FOCUS ON THE THINGS THAT

00:21:31.857 --> 00:21:33.859
ALSO REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS

00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:35.293

VEHICLES SO IT'S LESS POLLUTION.

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:51.977
ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES AND

00:21:52.044 --> 00:21:53.745

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:03.655
I THINK I AM WE NEED TO RE

00:22:03.722 --> 00:22:05.357

THE THE TARGETS IN THE CLEAN AIR

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:14.866
ACT VERY AGGRESSIVE FROM A WHEN

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.002
YOU LOOK AT THE ASH ADD IN BOTH

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.571
SOUTH COAST AND THE SAN JOAQUIN.

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:20.839
YOU KNOW THAT A LOT OF POLLUTION

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:22.074

THAT SO.

00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:27.012
THEY HAVE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE --

00:22:27.079 --> 00:22:29.214
CLEAN AIR LAWS IN THE WORLD IN

00:22:29.281 --> 00:22:31.149
THOSE AREAS BUT WE FRANKLY HAVE

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.951
TO DO MORE ON ON THINGS LIKE

00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.286
WOOD STOVES --

00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:36.521
IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND IN

00:22:36.588 --> 00:22:38.390
THE CASE OF SOUTH BECAUSE REALLY

00:22:38.457 --> 00:22:40.125
DOES NEED TO LOOK AT COMBUSTION

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:41.793
ACROSS THE BOARD WHETHER IT'S

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.395

BORDER -- IT

00:25:36.134 --> 00:25:37.602
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE EXTENSIVE BUT

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:40.171
THE THE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:41.640
WORK WE'RE DOING ABOUT CROSS

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.942
BORDER ISSUES AROUND A NUMBER OF

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:46.111
ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:49.080

MEXICO BORDER GETS A LOT OF

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:51.950
ATTENTION A LOT OF IT ISN'T

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:53.518
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT BUT IF.

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:54.920
YOU LIVE ON EITHER SIDE OF THAT

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.388
BORDER THE ENVIRONMENT TO VERY.

00:25:56.454 --> 00:25:57.789
BIG FOCAL POINT.

00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.592
SAYS MAYBE START WITH THE WATER

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:01.660
ISSUES.

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:03.929
ALL THE RIVER AS INTO THE US IN

00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:07.098
IN CALIFORNIA FLOW FROM SOUTH TO

00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:08.500
NORTH WE OFTEN THINK THAT

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:09.067
THEY'RE GONNA FLY THE OTHER

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:10.268
DIRECTION BACK.

00:26:10.335 --> 00:26:11.536
FROM THE NEW RIVER TO THE

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:13.838
TIJUANA RIVER --

00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.273
THOSE THE THE POLLUTION THAT'S

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.676
COMING FROM MEXICO INTO THE U.

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:18.877
S. IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:26:18.944 --> 00:26:21.513
CHALLENGES IN SAN DIEGO SADLY ON

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:22.914
THE BEACH CLOSURES.

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:25.650
YOU KNOW FROM SEWAGE IN TIJUANA

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:27.419
IT'S SOMETHING --

00:26:27.485 --> 00:26:28.687
THAT WAS A BIG CONCERN OF MINE

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.155
AT UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL

00:26:30.221 --> 00:26:31.923
PROTECTION AGENCY AND AND WE PUT

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:33.725
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:35.360
INTO WASTE WATER TREATMENT I'M

00:26:35.427 --> 00:26:36.594
IT'S GETTING BETTER IT'S

00:26:36.661 --> 00:26:38.196
CERTAINLY NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND WE

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.365
NEED A LOT OF CROSS BORDER

WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT PACIFIC

00:26:58.683 --> 00:27:00.251
GARBAGE PATCH A LOT OF THAT IS

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:02.520
COMING YOU KNOW FROM FROM THAT

THE SELDOM SEE.

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:22.841
THE SALTY OBVIOUSLY IS A VERY

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:23.975
HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:25.243

SALTON SEA FROM THE NEW RIVER IS

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:31.182
VERY TOXIC THERE'S A PROGRAM

00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:32.083
THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT PIPING

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.851
IT.

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.953
SO THAT THE FUMES ON EXPOSING

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:35.754
NEIGHBORS --

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:39.924

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:42.027
IMPERIAL COUNTY IMPERIAL COUNTY

00:27:44.529 --> 00:27:46.364
SIZEABLE NUMBER OF THOSE COME

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:46.898
FROM.

00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:48.933
MEXICO A SIZEABLE NUMBER OF

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.402
THOSE ALSO COME FROM IMPERIAL

00:27:50.468 --> 00:27:51.536
COUNTIES SO.

00:27:51.603 --> 00:27:52.771
SOMETIMES CONVENIENT TO BLAME

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:55.240
MEXICO BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

00:27:55.306 --> 00:27:56.207

BOARD HAS SENT MONITORS.

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.282
AND MONITORS AND WHAT WE FOUND

00:28:04.349 --> 00:28:06.684
IS IT'S A LOT OF TRASH BANNING.

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.253
I'M IN --

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:11.823
MEXICALI AND AND SO COMING OUT

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:12.557
WITH JUST SIMPLE WASTE

00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:14.025
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES COULD

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:16.461
SIGNIFICANTLY HELP THE AIR

CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.224

THE WATER FIX AND IN PARTICULAR

00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.608
AS THIS ADMINISTRATION PROCEEDS

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:06.911

00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:35.907
IMPORTANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.442
FOR THE PUBLIC BECAUSE WE SPEND

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.943

AS LABOR SECRETARY I WILL MAKE

00:47:43.493 --> 00:47:45.062
SURE THAT EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:47.130
REJECTS THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.099
DO THINGS THIS WAY BECAUSE WE'VE

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:51.134

THAT'S GREAT.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:47.504
THOROUGHLY ENJOYED OUR

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:50.040
CONVERSATION I'M I'M GONNA SHOOT

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.408
A QUESTION THAT I ASKED YOU TO

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.742
PRIVATELY JUST BECAUSE I THOUGHT

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:53.777
WAS REALLY INTERESTING IN IN

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:55.111
TERMS OF PAGA.

00:51:55.178 --> 00:51:57.447
AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS TO TRY

00:51:57.514 --> 00:51:58.381
TO ADDRESS THAT SO.

00:51:58.448 --> 00:51:59.483
IF YOU COULD DO THAT I WOULD

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.117
REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO THE

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:02.619
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACTOR

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:06.122
PAGA WAS A STATE LAW PASSED IN

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.624
RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT

00:52:07.691 --> 00:52:09.159
GOVERNMENT DIDN'T HAVE ALL THE

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:10.660
RESOURCES TO ENFORCE ALL OF THE

00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:11.795
LABOR LAWS.

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.797
AND SO THE IDEA WAS THAT IT GAVE

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:15.065
INDIVIDUALS A CHANCE TO GO TO

00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:17.534
COURT TO COLLECT STATE PENALTIES.

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.035
AND THEN 75% OF WHAT THEY

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.604
COLLECTED WILL GO TO THE STATE

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.072
AND 25% WOULD GO TO THE

00:52:22.138 --> 00:52:23.473
PLAINTIFF WHO BROUGHT THE SUIT.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.108
A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:26.576
PASSED.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:29.513
A LAW TO HELP THE LABOR AGENCY

00:52:29.579 --> 00:52:30.914
TO BETTER DOCUMENT HOW PULGAS

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.250
WORKING WHAT ABUSES THERE ARE

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:33.917
AND WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING TO

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:34.818
CURB THEM.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.019
SO OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS

00:52:36.086 --> 00:52:37.420
AFTER THE LABOR AGENCY HAS BEEN

00:52:37.487 --> 00:52:39.256
DOING WE NOW --

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:42.993
GET ONLINE NOTICES FROM EVERY

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:45.061
PLAINTIFF WHO WANTS TO FALL UPON

00:52:45.128 --> 00:52:45.695
THE SUIT WERE SUPPOSED TO GET

00:52:45.762 --> 00:52:47.631
ALL OF THEM WE ARE STILL WORKING

00:52:47.697 --> 00:52:49.733
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY OF

00:52:49.799 --> 00:52:51.368
THAT THIS FULL UTILIZATION OF

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:52.102
THE SYSTEM.

00:52:52.168 --> 00:52:53.637
BUT THEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO

00:52:53.703 --> 00:52:57.274
LOOK AT THE WHETHER WE WILL TAKE

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.842
ANY OF THEM FOR INVESTIGATION.

00:52:58.909 --> 00:53:01.044
WE HAVE DONE THAT ALTHOUGH AS I

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:02.612
WAS UP FRANK IN OUR CONVERSATION

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:04.114
IS STILL A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:05.982
OF THE NOTICES THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.851
TAKE INSIDE TO INVESTIGATE --

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.653
AND THEN AFTER THAT NOTICE THE

00:53:09.719 --> 00:53:11.121
PLATE TO FILE SUIT AND WHAT

00:53:11.187 --> 00:53:12.756
WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TRACKING OF

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:14.457
THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE CASES WE

00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:16.293
NOW GET SETTLEMENTS BEFORE THEY

00:53:16.359 --> 00:53:17.460
ARE FINALIZED SO WE HAVE A

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:18.628
CHANCE TO LOOK AND SEE.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:19.963
ARE ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:21.264
ALLEGE ACTUALLY --

00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:23.233
BEING RESOLVED OUR IS THE STATE

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:24.734
GETTING THE PENALTIES THAT WE

00:53:24.801 --> 00:53:26.436
SHOULD BE GETTING AND ARE THESE

00:53:26.503 --> 00:53:27.871
CASES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE PA

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:28.939
THE STATUTE WHICH IS TO MAKE

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:30.273
SURE THAT LABOR LAWS ARE BEING

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.508
ENFORCED.

00:53:31.575 --> 00:53:32.175
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS UNABLE TO

00:53:32.242 --> 00:53:33.176
STEP IT?

00:53:33.243 --> 00:53:35.011
UP AND WE'RE ALSO REALLYLOOKING

00:53:35.078 --> 00:53:37.981
AT TRACKING TRENDS AND ABUSE

00:53:38.048 --> 00:53:38.882
THAT'S GOING ON SO WE'RE LOOKING

00:53:38.949 --> 00:53:40.884
TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE OF

00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:42.452
CERTAIN PARTY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS

00:53:42.519 --> 00:53:43.320
WHO ARE.

00:53:43.386 --> 00:53:44.654
CONSTANTLY FILING THE SUIT TO

00:53:44.721 --> 00:53:45.722
WEAR THOSE OUTCOMES ARE NOT

00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:48.124
CONSISTENT WITH UP WITH PAGA --

00:53:48.191 --> 00:53:50.160
PURPOSES AND SO WE'RE TAKING A

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.227
CLOSE LOOK AT THAT WILL CONTINUE

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.896
TO DO THAT AND I I WE HAD A

00:53:52.963 --> 00:53:54.331
REALLY REALLY GREAT CONVERSATION

TERMS OF FUTURE LEGISLATION THAT

00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:05.468
MIGHT CORRECT --

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:06.736
ABUSE AND I THINK WE TALK TO

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.538

THEY REGULATE.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.689

CONTINUES TO BE HUGE AND WE

THE THE MOST ON I THINK

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.303
THREATENING THING ABOUT DYNAMAX

AT THIS POINT IS THIS

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:42.272
RETROACTIVE PROVISION OF

00:55:42.338 --> 00:55:43.573

SOME BUSINESS IN PARTICULAR

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:50.480
SMALLER BUSINESSES.

DIRECTION OF DEALING WITH THE

00:55:55.418 --> 00:55:58.555
RETROACTIVITY AND SOMEHOW BOB.

00:55:58.621 --> 00:55:59.856
YOU KNOW SITTING A TIME LINE

00:55:59.923 --> 00:56:02.525
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

00:56:02.592 --> 00:56:04.627
I IN TERMS OF THIS APPLICATION

00:56:04.694 --> 00:56:06.329
IF THERE'S NOT A MAJOR REFORM OR

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.597
WEEK I KNOW THERE'S LEGISLATION

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:08.965
OUT THERE LOOKING OUT.

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.834
REPEALING AT AND GOING BACK TO

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:12.702
MORE DOWN LOWER CODIFYING THAT

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.637
MAKE THIS RETROACTIVITY THING IS

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.106
WHEN I CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM THE

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.007
FOLKS THAT COME.

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:19.242
TO MY OFFICER THAT I NEED IN

00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:20.810

I'M GOING FORWARD YOU GOT A NEW

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:23.780
LAW WE GOT TO FOLLOW THAT.

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:25.415
ARE MAJOR CHANGE FROM WHAT USED

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:27.016
TO BE HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:29.018
PROTECTED SO COULD YOU EXPAND ON

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:29.853
MATTER.

00:56:29.919 --> 00:56:31.554
AT LEAST GIVE US SOME PATHWAY

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:34.090
THAT WE MIGHT ALL CONSIDER ****

00:56:34.157 --> 00:56:37.427
WE TRY TO DO WHAT I JUST SAID

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:38.194
BALLOTS [inaudible]

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.162
AXEL.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.230
THE ISSUES OF MISS

00:56:40.296 --> 00:56:41.898
CLASSIFICATION THAT WERE DRESSED

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:44.834
IN DYNAMICS OF CERTAINLY DID NOT --

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:47.203
BEGIN WITH DYNAMAX AND IS A LOT

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:49.139
ALL BY DYNAMIX BUT IN THAT

00:56:49.205 --> 00:56:50.640
UNANIMOUS SUPREME COURT DECISION

00:56:50.707 --> 00:56:53.143
THE COURT BASICALLY RECOGNIZE

00:56:53.209 --> 00:56:54.677
THAT MISS CLASSIFICATION.

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:56.913
IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO BOTH

00:56:56.980 --> 00:56:58.648
EMPLOYEES AND THOSE WHO SHOULD

00:56:58.715 --> 00:57:00.016
ENJOY THE PROTECTIONS OF OUR

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.384
LABOR LAWS AS EMPLOYEES.

00:57:01.451 --> 00:57:03.887
AS WELL AS TO BUSINESSES WHO

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:05.655
SHOULD NOT BE FORCED INTO A RACE

00:57:05.722 --> 00:57:07.090
TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT --

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:10.059
WHEN IT COMES TO OF THE THE

00:57:10.126 --> 00:57:12.462
COSTS AND THE RESPONSIBILITIES

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:13.830
OF RUNNING A BUSINESS?

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:16.633
AND THAT DECISION ADOPTED A MORE

00:57:16.699 --> 00:57:18.535
SIMPLIFIED A. B. C. TEST FOR

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.369
DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEBODY IS AN

00:57:19.435 --> 00:57:20.637
EMPLOYEE OR INDEPENDENT

00:57:20.703 --> 00:57:21.738
CONTRACTOR.

00:57:21.805 --> 00:57:23.473
AND WHAT IT DID WAS BUILT ON

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.843
SOME EXISTING CASE LAW ABOUT ONE

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:28.077
OF THE THREE DEFINITIONS IN THE

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:29.445
WAGE ORDERS TO SUFFER PERMIT

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:30.680
STANDARD.

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.916
AND SO WE IN THIS ADMINISTRATION

00:57:32.982 --> 00:57:34.417
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:35.552
QUESTION THAT'S BIGGER THAN

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.987
DYNAMAX THAT IS ABOUT WHAT IS

00:57:38.054 --> 00:57:41.124
THE UP FOR A PROMISE THAT OF THE

00:57:41.191 --> 00:57:42.926
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE TO

00:57:42.992 --> 00:57:44.527
EMPLOYEES AT THE CALIFORNIA TO

00:57:44.594 --> 00:57:46.029
PEOPLE WORKING CALIFORNIA.

00:57:46.095 --> 00:57:47.430
WHERE THE STANDARDS THAT WE WANT

00:57:47.497 --> 00:57:48.998
TO EXIST REGARDLESS OF STATUS

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.099
AND HOW DO WE PRESERVE THE

00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.035
ABILITY FOR BUSINESSES TO BE

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:54.070
INNOVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AND TWO

00:57:54.137 --> 00:57:55.405
ADOPTED CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY?

00:57:55.471 --> 00:57:56.806
AND THOSE OF THE BALANCES THAT

00:57:56.873 --> 00:57:58.141
WE ARE ALL TRYING TO STRIKE IT'S

00:57:58.208 --> 00:57:59.142
A CHALLENGE.

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.510
THAT I THINK WILL BE ONE THE

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:01.144
MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DEAL

00:58:01.211 --> 00:58:01.778
WITH.

00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:03.179
IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOU THE

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:04.280
LEGISLATURE IN THIS

00:58:04.347 --> 00:58:06.649
ADMINISTRATION AND WE HAVE HAD A

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:08.251
AN OPEN DOOR POLICY ABOUT THIS

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.452
I'VE MET WITH --

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.588
FOLKS ON ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.122
RIGHT EMPLOYEES --

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:17.260
AND UNIONS WHO ARE DEDICATED TO

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:20.096
PRESERVING THE PROTECTIONS THAT

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:23.199
HAVE BEEN SO HARD --

00:58:23.266 --> 00:58:26.236
EMPLOYERS AND THOSE IN THE

00:58:26.302 --> 00:58:28.271
INDUSTRY MOST DIRECTLY AFFECTED

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:31.140
BY THE DYNAMIC DECISION WHO --

00:58:31.207 --> 00:58:33.076
FRANKLY WANT FLEXIBILITY AND

00:58:33.142 --> 00:58:34.110
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY WANT A

00:58:34.177 --> 00:58:35.311
LEVEL PLAYING FIELD.

00:58:35.378 --> 00:58:36.446
AND SO WILL CONTINUE THOSE

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:38.147
CONVERSATIONS AS YOU MENTIONED

00:58:38.214 --> 00:58:39.282
CENTER THERE IS LEGISLATION

00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:40.884
ALREADY IN THE WORKS AND I WILL

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:42.151
BE DEDICATED TO ENFORCING

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:43.286
WHATEVER --

00:58:43.353 --> 00:58:45.421
IS IS PASSED I WILL SAY ON THE

00:58:45.488 --> 00:58:47.557
RETROACTIVITY ISSUE --

00:58:47.624 --> 00:58:48.958
I THINK THAT.

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.760
FOLLOWING THE CASE THERE WAS A

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:53.363
REQUEST TO THE COURT. TO FIND

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:54.931
THAT THE DECISION SHOULD BE

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:57.066
PROSPECTIVE ONLY AND THE COURT

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:59.502
OF DID REFUSE TO TAKE THAT STEP --

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:01.371
AND SO AT THIS POINT WE'RE JUST

00:59:01.437 --> 00:59:02.705
LOOKING AT ALL THE ISSUES THAT

00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:04.707
WE TALKED ABOUT AND TRY TO MAKE

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.075
SURE THAT WE DO WHAT IS BOTH

REQUIREMENT FOR FARM LABOR

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:34.397
CONTRACTORS TO PROVIDE SEXUAL

01:00:34.464 --> 01:00:35.565

VIEWS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.841

HAPPY TO DO THAT SO THANK YOU TO

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:49.078
THE SENATOR FOR THAT LEGISLATION --

THE IT WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT OF

01:00:51.147 --> 01:00:52.949
FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS --

01:00:53.016 --> 01:00:54.484
EDUCATE NOT JUST SUPERVISORS

01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:56.252
BROSSEAU EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.521
PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT --

01:00:58.588 --> 01:01:01.290
AND THAT LAW WHEN THE LAW FIRST

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.292
WENT INTO EFFECT I SENT A NOTICE

01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:06.095
OUT -- TO

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.163
THE AFFECTED COMMUNITY.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.998
LABOR CONTRACTORS WHO WE HAD

REGISTERED --

01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:11.367
WITH THE WITH THE LABOR

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:12.802
COMMISSIONER TO INFORM THEM OF

01:01:12.869 --> 01:01:14.437
THE REQUIREMENTS.

01:01:14.504 --> 01:01:17.907
AND AND WE ALSO CONTACT WITH

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:19.776
SOMEONE IN MY OFFICE TO BE ABLE

CONTINUING OF CONSULTATION ON ON

SOME OF THE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:28.818
I THINK THAT'S RELATED.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.820
TO HOW WE HELP ON BUSINESSES TO

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.755
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO

01:01:32.822 --> 01:01:34.757
COMPLY WITH THE WITH THE

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:37.493
IMPORTANT POLICIES THAT ARE PUT

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:38.961
FORTH UP FROM THIS BODY.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:41.164
AND JUST THIS PAST WEEK WE

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:42.932
ISSUED OUR FOR CITATIONS FOR

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.634
EMPLOYERS FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.469
WHO HAD NOT PROVIDED THAT

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:47.737
EDUCATION.

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:49.472
AND I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.474
NOT ONLY THAT WE GIVE EMPLOYERS

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.443
NOTICE THAT WE GIVE THEM TIME TO

01:01:53.509 --> 01:01:55.011
COMPLY BUT THEN ALSO THAT WILL

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.245
FORCE THE LAWS THAT THAT HAVE

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.213
BEEN WRITTEN.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.414
AND THAT'S BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.383
SPECIFIC EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BUT

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.818
ALSO TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.487
THAT WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.522
BASIC STANDARDS THAT WE WANT TO

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.758
EXIST IN CALIFORNIA AND WE WANT

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:11.360
A WORKING PEOPLE AND AND THEIR

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:12.361
BUSINESS.

01:02:12.428 --> 01:02:12.962
HONEST.

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:15.131
COMPETING TO ENJOY SO IF YOU

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:18.935
CITING THE TRAINING OF FEAR TO

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:19.602
PROVIDE --

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:21.370
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PART IN

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:23.873
THE TRAINING AND OUR HOPE IS

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:25.508
THAT THAT WILL ALSO HAVE A

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.411
RIPPLE EFFECT AND ENCOURAGE.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.612
OTHER FLC IS WERE NOT.

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.781
ALREADY IN COMPLIANCE --

01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:32.882
TO TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WE

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:34.917
ALSO INTRODUCED A NEW FORM ON

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:36.419
THE LABOR COMMISSION'S WEBSITE

01:02:36.486 --> 01:02:38.754
THAT WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.589
THAT THE TRAINING IS NOT TAKING

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.290
PLACE TO SPECIFICALLY LET US

01:02:41.357 --> 01:02:43.926
KNOW ABOUT THAT SO WE REALLY TRY

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:45.328
TO UPGRADE OUR ABILITY.

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:46.696
FOR ONLINE ACCESS TO OUR

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.264
SERVICES DURING MY TIME AS LABOR

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:49.899
COMMISSIONER AND MAKING SURE

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:51.901
THAT WE HAVE FORMS THAT ARE EASY

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:53.836
TO UNDERSTAND AND TRANSLATED AND

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:56.005
EASY TO USE WAS A KEY PART OF

01:02:56.072 --> 01:02:56.606
BECOMING MORE ACCESSIBLE AS

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.406
GOVERNMENT.

01:02:57.473 --> 01:02:59.142
WE DO HAVE A SPECIAL FORM ALSO

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.376
FOR THAT PARTICULAR VIOLATE FREE

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:01.944
ONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:03:02.011 --> 01:03:04.013
LEADERSHIP WITH THAT AND AS YOU

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:05.214
MENTIONED --

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.382
ONE OF THE FEATURES OF THAT

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.618
IMPLEMENTATION IS TO GIVE FARM

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.453
LABOR CONTRACTORS THE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.255
OPPORTUNITY TO COMPLY.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:15.825
THE AGENCY'S GOAL IS TO ACHIEVE

01:03:15.892 --> 01:03:17.260
THE TRAINING IN THE PROTECTION

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:18.594
OF THE WORK FORCE.

01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.696
IN THAT THE PENALTY PHASES ARE

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.598
LATER AFTER.

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:23.666
NOT --

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:28.004
REFUSING TO COMPLY BASICALLY --

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:28.604
WE ALSO TALKED SOME ABOUT THE

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:32.141
UNDER WE KNOW THAT LITERALLY

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.809
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IS

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.012
CHANGING HANDS BUT OFTEN WITH.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.648
WORKERS NOT BEING PAID.

01:03:38.714 --> 01:03:42.585
WHAT THEIR DO AND OFTEN?

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.920
LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS.

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:44.987
BEING PUT AT A COMPETITIVE

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:47.523
DISADVANTAGE BY THOSE WHO ARE

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.725
NOT PLAYING BY THE RULES --

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.727
DURING YOUR TENURE AN ISSUE MOVE

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:52.528
FORWARD.

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:53.963
WELL WHAT CAN BE DONE --

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.498
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE FOR BETTER

01:03:55.565 --> 01:03:57.633
COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS

01:03:57.700 --> 01:04:00.203
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN SHARING

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.604
INFORMATION AND DATA AND?

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.905
ALSO.

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:05.608
PUBLICIZING WHERE YOU HAVE FOUND

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.543
VIOLATORS SO THAT OTHERS WHO

01:04:07.610 --> 01:04:09.679
MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO CUT CORNERS

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:11.781
REALIZE THAT THERE WILL BE

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:13.282
CONSEQUENCES.

01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:15.718
AS LABOR COMMISSIONER --

01:04:15.785 --> 01:04:18.354
I REALLY MOVED THE AGENCY AWAY

01:04:18.421 --> 01:04:20.122
FROM THE SWEEPING METHOD OF

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.757
ENFORCEMENT MEANING YOU'RE MORE

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:23.626
INSPECTIONS THE BETTER AND

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.161
RANDOM INSPECTIONS.

01:04:25.228 --> 01:04:26.262
BUT WE REALLY MOVED TO A

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:28.297
TARGETED MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH

01:04:28.364 --> 01:04:29.899
MEANING WE WERE LOOKING AT

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.734
EMPLOYERS BASED ON INFORMATION

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.369
WE GATHERED AHEAD OF TIME BASED

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:34.737
ON PARTNERSHIPS --

01:04:34.804 --> 01:04:37.740
ON THE GROUND FOR THOSE WHO WERE

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:38.441
ALREADY BREAKING THE LAW.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.343
AND THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S JUST

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:41.644
GOOD GOVERNMENT RIGHT WE DON'T

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:42.878
WANT TO BE INSPECTING EMPLOYERS

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.046
WERE PLAYING BY THE RULES

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.681
THERE'S NO REASON. FOR THEM TO

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:46.782
HAVE TO STOP THEIR BUSINESS FOR

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:47.917
INSPECTION IT'S NOT A GOOD USE

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:50.820
OF GOVERNMENT SOURCES IT DOESN'T-HELP WORKERS --

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.989
AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.924
WE WERE GOING TO THE WORST

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.859
VIOLATORS AND FINDING.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:05:00.229
ALL OF THE WAY THE LAW MAKING

01:05:00.296 --> 01:05:02.131
LAWBREAKING COSTLY AND THEN

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:03.699
TRYING TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:04.767
AND SO THAT WAS OUR POST

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:05.801
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND I'M

01:05:05.868 --> 01:05:07.670
REALLY EXCITED TO EXPAND THAT

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.239
MODEL ACROSS THE LABOR AGENCY.

01:05:10.306 --> 01:05:11.540
TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BE

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.576
MORE STRATEGIC AT EVERY LEVEL SO

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:14.710
THAT WERE USING GOVERNMENT

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.412
RESOURCE IN A SMART WAY --

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:18.914
SO THAT WE ARE GOING TO WEAR THE

01:05:18.981 --> 01:05:21.050
BAD ACTORS ARE WHEN I CAME WHEN

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:22.385
I BECAME LABOR COMMISSIONER.

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:23.953
ROUGHLY HALF A LITTLE BIT LESS

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.155
THAN HALF OF ALL INSPECTIONS LED

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.823
TO A CITATION OF ANY KIND.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.158
WHICH MEANS THAT ABOUT HALF OF

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.327
INSPECTIONS WERE NOT OF ANYBODY

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:32.895
THAT WAS EITHER THE LAW WAS NOT

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:34.397
BEING BROKEN OR THEY WERE BEGIN

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:35.531
DOING ENOUGH TO FIND IT.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:37.266
AND IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.168
HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED IN THAT

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:42.905
AREA WE ARE BETWEEN 8090% OF THE

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:43.973
INSPECTIONS THAT WE DO ACTUALLY

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.608
IS ALL TODAY CITATION.

01:05:45.675 --> 01:05:47.243
AND IN THE STRATEGIC APPROACH WE

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.144
WORK WITH COMMITTEE BASED

01:05:48.210 --> 01:05:50.012
PARTNERS TO TALK TO WORKERS

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.514
OFFSITE BEFORE WE DO AN

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.317
INSPECTION WHERE WE LOOK DEEPLY

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.918
FOR DO WE DO COMPLEX WAIT AUDITS

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.186
TO FIND OUT WHETHER WORKERS.

01:05:57.253 --> 01:05:58.187
IT WOULD WORK BECAUSE OF THE BIG

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.021
GUY WHICH IS HOW MUCHTHEY'RE

01:05:59.088 --> 01:06:00.956
OWED IN THOSE CASES WE'RE AT

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:03.192
ABOUT A 100% RATE IN TERMS OF

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.393
OUR INSPECTION TO CITATION.

01:06:04.460 --> 01:06:06.562
SO THAT BETTER TARGETING IS JUST

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:08.831
IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S SMART AND

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:10.232
IT'S GOOD ENFORCEMENT IS IS WITH

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:12.134
WHAT HAS GAINED SUPPORT FROM

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:14.570
BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS FOR

01:06:14.637 --> 01:06:15.438
FOR OUR ATTACK ON THE

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:16.572
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY.

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.240
THANK YOU IN IN JUST A FINAL

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:19.342
POINT ON THAT I BELIEVE.

YOU'RE AGENCIES ALSO AVAILABLE

TO EMPLOYERS IF THEY KNOW A

01:06:23.312 --> 01:06:25.448
COMPETITORS BREAKING THE RULES

01:06:25.514 --> 01:06:28.417
THAT CAN ALSO GET THE ATTENTION.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:34.990
OF THE AGENCY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.960

BETWEEN THE HARVARD YALE

SITUATION AT HOME.

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.272
A SERIOUS QUESTION.

01:06:50.339 --> 01:06:51.841
THERE'S A SMILE SO I DON'T KNOW

01:06:51.907 --> 01:06:54.210
WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS --

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:55.745
QUICKLY A BECAUSE I THINK MY

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:57.313
COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN PRETTY GOOD

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.681
TO COVER SOME PRETTY IMPORTANT

01:06:58.748 --> 01:06:59.548
ISSUES.

01:06:59.615 --> 01:07:00.516
AND OF COURSE --

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.151
YOUR RESPONSES AT THAT YOU

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:03.986
PROVIDED THE RULES COMMITTEE AND

01:07:04.053 --> 01:07:04.920

01:07:04.987 --> 01:07:06.122
YOU'VE YOU'VE REALLY GOT A

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.456
HANDLE.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.758
ON ALL OF THE RELEVANT ISSUES OF

01:07:08.824 --> 01:07:09.725
THE DEPARTMENTS THAT YOU'RE

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.026
GOING TO OVERSEE.

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:14.330
ANY COMMENTS ON WORKERS

01:07:14.397 --> 01:07:16.432
COMPENSATION ISSUE I I MEAN I

01:07:16.499 --> 01:07:17.600
KNOW THIS IS.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.402
JUST GETTING STARTED IT'S THE

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:20.636
ONE THING I HEAR ABOUT --

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.605
IT WHEN I'M UP AND DOWN THE

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:25.274
STATE TALKING TO ANY GROUP OF

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:27.743
BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS YOU WE

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.978
DID A LOT OF WORK.%

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.112
I WELL THE PREVIOUS

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:33.616
ADMINISTRATION. TO TRY TO

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:36.285
ADDRESS SOME ISSUES BUT I I

01:07:36.352 --> 01:07:38.721
STILL HERE SO I GUESS IT'S FROM

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:40.423
WHAT PERSPECTIVE YOU SAID.

01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:42.124
ARE THERE ISSUES YOU THINK ARE

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.726
THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:45.294
AN ADDRESS --

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.763
AND AGAIN IT DEPENDS LARGE SMALL

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:50.866
BUT JUST FROM THE BROAD VIEW.

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.668
SO I WILL SAY THAT FROM WHERE I

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.970
SIT AND AS YOU NOTED I'M STILL

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:56.071
LEARNING --

01:07:56.138 --> 01:07:57.473
AND I'M STILL GETTING FAMILIAR

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.941
WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE JOB.

01:07:59.008 --> 01:08:00.509
BUT THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.011
PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO HAS

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:03.979
RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENTS SO I

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:05.147
WOULD SAY WE'RE ON THE RIGHT

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:06.849
TRACK WHEN IT COMES --

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:08.184
TO WORKERS COMP REFORM AND

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.718
MAKING SURE THAT THE MAIN

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:10.352
PRIORITIES OF OUR WORKERS COMP

01:08:10.419 --> 01:08:13.155
SYSTEM WHICH IS TO INSURE THE

01:08:13.222 --> 01:08:14.723
INJURED WORKERS GET THE

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:16.192
TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED TO GET

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:16.826
BACK TO WORK AS QUICKLY AS THEY

01:08:16.892 --> 01:08:17.460
CAN.

01:08:17.526 --> 01:08:18.828
AND THAT WE CONTROL COSTS FOR

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:21.397
EMPLOYERS THAT THOSE TWO GOALS.

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:23.265
ARE BEING MET THEHAVE

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:25.534
IMPROVEMENTS IN THAT AREA DUE TO

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:27.203
THE CHANGES LEGISLATIVE CHANGES

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:28.871
THAT WERE PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO --

01:08:28.938 --> 01:08:30.239
WITH THINGS LIKE INDEPENDENT

01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.374
MEDICAL REVIEW WE'VE CUT DOWN

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:34.210
THE TIME TO RESOLVE MEDICAL

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:35.778
DISPUTES DRAMATICALLY --

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:37.046
FROM WHAT WAS NINE TO TWELVE

01:08:37.112 --> 01:08:38.981
MONTHS AND NOW IT'S LIKE THIRTY

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:39.682
TO FORTY FIVE DAYS.

01:08:39.748 --> 01:08:41.050
AND SO THOSE ARE IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:08:41.116 --> 01:08:44.086
THE SYSTEM WE ARE ALSO UPGRADING

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:49.258
OUR OUR DATABASE ARE SO THROUGH

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.125
THAT.

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:52.328
I AM VERY DATA DRIVEN ABOUT HOW

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.296
WE SHOULD DO OUR WORK SO I WILL

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:55.764
BE LOOKING CLOSELY WITH MY

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.533
DEPARTMENT OF MY DIVISIONS AT

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.301
WHAT THE DATA TELLS US.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:01.103
WHAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT ANY

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.472
ONGOING ABUSES PROBLEMS FRICTION

01:09:03.539 --> 01:09:05.541
IN THE SYSTEM THINGS WE NEED TO

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:06.809
IMPROVE AND --

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.844
CERTAINLY TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL

01:09:08.911 --> 01:09:09.378
OF THOSE TO THE BEST OF MY

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:10.346
ABILITY.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:11.814
WELL THANK YOU I WILL BE

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.916
INTERESTED AS YOU GET UNDER WAY

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.284
IN THIS NEW --

01:09:15.351 --> 01:09:16.519
POSITION.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:19.088
AS YOU TRAVEL THE STATE

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:21.090
CERTAINLY I HAVE HEARD FROM --

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:24.093
SILICON VALLEY ORANGE COUNTY OF

01:09:24.159 --> 01:09:26.662
MY OWN COMMUNITY IN SAN DIEGO

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:27.763
STARTING FROM THE TIME WHEN I

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.265
WAS SPEAKER AND STARTED TO DO

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.032
THOSE.

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:32.034
CONVERSATIONS THAT WHILE THERE

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:33.702
HAVE BEEN MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS AND

01:09:33.769 --> 01:09:35.037
I TRIED TO FOCUS IN ON THE

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:36.539
SPECIFICS WHEN PEOPLE WOULD MAKE

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:37.473
COMMENTS.

01:09:37.540 --> 01:09:39.708
AND IT SEEMS TO BE THE MID TO

01:09:39.775 --> 01:09:41.810
SMALL SIZE BUSINESSES HAVE

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.812
COMMENTS NOW I KNOW WE CANNOT

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.180
PLEASE EVERYONE IN THAT

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.249
BALANCING ACT OF OF HOW YOU

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:49.151
ADDRESSES ISSUES BUT I'D BE

01:09:49.218 --> 01:09:51.053
INTERESTED IN OUR AFTER A PERIOD

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.354
OF TIME TO COME BACK TO YOU AND

01:09:52.421 --> 01:09:54.256
ASK YOU WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS.

01:09:54.323 --> 01:09:54.590
ARE ON THAT.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:58.427
AND THEN AS WE YOU KNOW I'M

01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:59.662
GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD EVERYONE

01:09:59.728 --> 01:10:01.530
KEEPS PREDICTING A DOWNTURN IN

01:10:01.597 --> 01:10:03.632
THE ECONOMY YOU KNOW I I AND I

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:04.967
KNOW IT SOME POINT THAT WILL

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:06.535
ALWAYS BE THE CASE.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.437
BUT WE HAD CERTAINLY ISSUES IN

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:09.605
THE LAST.

01:10:09.672 --> 01:10:13.676
NUMBER OF YEARS --

01:10:13.742 --> 01:10:14.243
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE TEN

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:15.711
AROUND EIGHTY D. AND AT THE WORK

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.747
FORCE ABILITY TO RESPOND.

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.115
TO OUR CITIZENS AROUND

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.484
UNEMPLOYMENT AND ACCESS TO THE

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:24.320
DEPARTMENT SO MUCH SO THAT I

01:10:24.386 --> 01:10:26.622
THINK THE EMPLOYEES WERE REALLY

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.491
SUFFERING FROM MORALE BURN OUT.

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.160
ALL THOSE THINGS AND STRIKE

01:10:31.226 --> 01:10:32.461
TEAMS HAD TO BE SENT ND BE

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:34.296
HELPFUL I AM.

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.832
HOPEFUL THAT ALL OF THAT IS MUCH

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:38.834
BETTER GRANTED YOU'RE IN THE

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.904
POSITION NEWLY MUCH BETTER BUT

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.872
MUCH LIKE OUR RAINY DAY FUND

01:10:43.939 --> 01:10:46.408
PREPARES US FOR A A YOU KNOW IF

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:48.611
THERE IS A DOWNTURN --

01:10:48.677 --> 01:10:50.245
FOR A SOFTER LANDING OF SUCH

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.948
WILL EDT HAVE THE ABILITY.

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.683
TO ARE NOT BE PUT BACK IN THE

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.752
SAME POSITION WITH THE LEVEL OF

01:10:56.819 --> 01:10:58.253
STAFFING EMPLOYEES.

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.989
AND HAVE WE RECTIFY THAT TO THE

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:04.460
DEGREE THAT WE ARE WILL BE ABLE

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:05.294
TO APPROACH ANYTHING COMING UP.

01:11:05.361 --> 01:11:07.129
BETTER SUITED THEM WE WERE IN

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:08.964
THE LAST.

01:11:09.031 --> 01:11:10.232
SO THAT IS DEFINITELY A HIGH

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:12.534
PRIORITY FOR FOR FOR ME AND FOR

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.103
THIS ADMINISTRATION --

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.838
I THINK THAT THERE ARE TWO

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.539
APPROACHES THAT ONE IS THAT WE

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.274
DO NEED TO GUARD AGAINST THAT

01:11:19.341 --> 01:11:20.643
KIND OF DOWNTURN --

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.243
WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THE

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:24.013
LEGISLATURE UPGRADING ALSO THE

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:25.781
EDT SYSTEM WE THINK THAT THAT

01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:27.549
WILL THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY HELP

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:28.884
AND AND AND SOFTEN THE BLOW.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.252
I THINK THAT THE OTHER PIECE OF

01:11:30.319 --> 01:11:32.388
THIS IS THAT THERE IS THERE ARE

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.723
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITIES CREATED

01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:38.661
BY THE BY THE INVESTMENTS THAT

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:39.828
WILL BE MADE.

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:41.463
IN THE YEARS TO COME AND YOU

01:11:41.530 --> 01:11:43.065
KNOW IN IN IN CLIMATE WHICH

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:45.034
WHICH WHAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED IN

01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:47.336
HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.437
AND ALL OF THESE GREAT

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.572
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AND FOR

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.374
GOOD JOBS AND SO UNDER THE LABOR

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:54.209
WORKFORCE AGENCY WE ALSO HAVE

01:11:54.276 --> 01:11:55.277
ALL THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:56.779
WORK WHICH IS ABOUT MAKING SURE

01:11:56.845 --> 01:11:57.813
THAT WE ARE ALIGNING.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:58.981
THE SKILLS ABILITIES IN THE

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.283
TALENTS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH THE

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.419
JOBS THAT WE HAVE AND WITH GOOD

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:04.953
HIGH QUALITY FAMILY SUPPORTING

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:05.721
JOBS.

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:07.156
AND SO THE MORE WE CAN DO THAT

01:12:07.222 --> 01:12:08.590
THE MORE WE GUARD AGAINST THE

01:12:08.657 --> 01:12:11.126
DOWNTURN ALTOGETHER BY CREATING

01:12:11.193 --> 01:12:13.462
THE MOST ROBUST ECONOMY WE HAVE.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:16.465
WHERE WE INSURE THAT A WE USED

01:12:16.532 --> 01:12:18.300
CALIFORNIANS FOR THE WORK THAT

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:19.835
WE NEED AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:21.770
TRAINED AND SKILLED AND

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.905
CONNECTED TO EMPLOYERS TO DO

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:23.472
THAT?

01:12:23.539 --> 01:12:24.973
AND SO I THINK THAT'S A PART OF

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.643
THE ANSWER BUT ASSUMING THAT

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:28.477

EMPLOYERS BOTH LARGE AND IN

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.694
PARTICULAR SMALL.

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:20.229
NEWSPAPERS ARE NOT WHAT THEY

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.697
USED TO BE IT IS THE INTERNET

01:13:21.764 --> 01:13:23.132
AGE BUT NOT ALL OF OUR SMALL

01:13:23.198 --> 01:13:25.100
BUSINESS.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.236
MEN AND WOMEN OPERATORS ARE

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:28.604
INTERNET SAVVY OR HAVE ACCESS TO

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:30.139
THE INTERNET.

01:13:30.205 --> 01:13:31.807
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT IS

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:34.109
SUFFICIENT ANYMORE.

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:36.078
TO PRINT A A NOTICE RESEARCHERS

WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO COMPLY

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.356
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO TRY TO

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.091
AVOID INVADE?

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.559

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:00.068
WHERE?

01:14:00.135 --> 01:14:01.937
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES DON'T DO AS

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.039

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:05.374
