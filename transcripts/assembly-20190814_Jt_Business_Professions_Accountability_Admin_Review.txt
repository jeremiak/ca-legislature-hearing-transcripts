CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING AS GOOD A JOB AS WE NEED TO DO AND AS I'VE SHARED WITH WITH THAT DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES THAT ARE DISTRICT OFFICE GRAPPLE WITH OUR COMPLAINTS ABOUT PROFESSIONAL LICENSING AND THE PROCESS SO IT'S ONE OF THE TOP CONSTITUENT ISSUES AND- I CLEARLY ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB MAKING GOVERNMENT.

WONDERFUL WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT. OKAY GREAT LET'S GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED OPTIONAL ONE IS AN UPDATE ON PROFESSIONAL LICENSING AND MODERNIZATION. ALL GOT A LETTER PANELISTS COMING UP AND YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF TO I. TWO GOOD MORNING GEN GOT AND JUST GIVE YOUR GIVE A QUICK INTRO. HI CHRISTY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GOOD MORNING I'M CHRIS SHELTON THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS. JASON BUT SHOWING THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. WELCOME I CAN'T TELL AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET US STARTED YES THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRED MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TODAY TO JUST GIVE SOME BRIEF REMARKS. SUMMARIZING THE DEPARTMENT AND ALSO LAYING THE LAND A LITTLE BAD ON THEIR I. T. PROJECTS I THERE'S A HANDOUT THAT I PREPARED YOU SHOULD HAVE COPIES THE SERGEANTS ALSO HAVE EXTRA COPIES AND IT'S AVAILABLE ONLINE. FOR VIEWERS OF CAL CHANNEL OR OTHER PLACES. AND SO I'LL JUST START ON PAGE ONE WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS IS RESPONSE. FOR PROMOTING CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SUPPORTING A FAIR AND COMPETITIVE MARKET PLACE. IT'S REALLY AN UMBRELLA DEPARTMENT SO. IT HAS WITHIN IT ALMOST FORTY BOARDS BUREAUS AND OTHER PROGRAMS. THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR. THIS ACHIEVING THIS MISSION. THROUGH THIS DEPARTMENT THEY PERFORM TWO MAIN ACTIVITIES THESE BOARDS AND AEROSPACE A LICENSE SO THE DEPARTMENT LICENSES ABOUT. THREE MILLION PROFESSIONALS. IN ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO A RANGE OF DIFFERENT FOLKS AT FROM DOCTORS ACUPUNCTURISTS. YEP FOLKS WHO DO COSMETOLOGY A WHOLE RANGE OF FOLKS. AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT BUSINESSES SO PLACES LIKE AUTO REPAIR FACILITIES AND OTHER TYPES OF BUSINESSES. THE DEPARTMENT ALSO CONDUCTS ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS ANOTHER CRITICAL ASPECTS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE COMPLAINTS ABOUT. THESE PROFESSIONALS THE DEPARTMENT WILL INVESTIGATE THOSE COMPLAINTS AND TAKE ACTION. WHEN APPROPRIATE. SO THAT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PROVIDES OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SPORTS IN BARROWS. THAT SUPPORTS OVER THREE THOUSAND POSITIONS. THE DEPARTMENT AND ITS ASSOCIATED ENTITIES. AND BASICALLY THE DEPARTMENT IS. ALMOST ENTIRELY FUNDED BY THE FEE PAID BY THOSE THAT IT LICENSES. WHAT'S REALLY DOCTORS THE. COSMETOLOGIST THAT THOSE WHO ARE PAYING OFF. PERMIT AS WELL AS ITS IT PROJECTS THAT WILL DISCUSS. SO IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO WE PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON THE HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT'S IT PROJECTS SO HISTORICALLY THE DEPARTMENT HAD A VARIETY OF LEGACY IT SYSTEMS THAT WERE IN PLACE AT THESE INDIVIDUAL PORTS AND BUREAUS AND SO THEY ALL HAD SORT OF. YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME THAT WERE IN PLACE AT A VARIETY OF THEM BUT THERE WERE A WHOLE COULD HOST OF KIND OF HODGE PODGE OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEMS THEY DIDN'T HAVE YOU FOLKS COULDN'T PAY ONLINE THEY WEREN'T YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WAS A NEEDED BY THESE BOARDS IN EUROS IN MANY CASES THERE WERE SOME DATA ISSUES THEY WON'T NECESSARILY VERY USER FRIENDLY SO THERE REALLY WERE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD IDENTIFIED. AND WANTED TO ADDRESS THROUGH AN I. T. SYSTEM AND SEVEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THE DEPARTMENT REALLY LOOPS LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO TY TO UPGRADE ITS IT SYSTEMS FOR THESE BOARDS IN PEROT'S THAT'S THIS THERE ARE THAT SERVE EFFORT WAS A BREEZE. IT WAS PROPOSED TO BE NINE INTEGRATED I. T. SOLUTION REALLY BRING THE BOARDS AND ROSE UP TO KIND OF THAT THE MODERN I. T. KIND OF SOLUTIONS FOR LICENSING AND ENFORCEMENT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED TO BE COMPLETED IN THREE FATE IS UP OR RELEASES WITH. ROUGHLY HALF OF THE BOARDS AND GROWS IN THAT THIRD RELEASE. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A BUDGET OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT WAS A REALLY ENVISIONED TO BE COMPLETED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN. I TOOK HER WAS SELECTED AS THE VENDOR OUT TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND THAT HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. I SO THE FIRST RELEASE OCCURRED IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT EMERGED IN THEIR MERCH PRETTY QUICKLY. SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES THEIR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS THAT MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THESE BOARDS INTERESTED TO THEIR LICENSING ACTIVITIES. THERE WERE DELAYS THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL COST INCREASES AND THERE'S A STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT THAT OUTLINED A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT FACED. US A GIVEN THESE CHALLENGES THE ADMINISTRATION AND FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THAT IT INTENDED TO CANCEL THE PROJECT. AFTER RELEASE TO. AND A LOT OF THIS WAS DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AS WELL AS THESE OTHER ISSUES THAT ACOSTA TOTALED. ABOUT NINETY SIX MILLION JUST FOR THAT RELEASED ONE INTO SO FOR ABOUT HALF THE PROJECT AT THAT POINT. I SO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE DEPARTMENT DID LAUNCH RELEASE TO AN IN GENERAL I THINK THE- RESPONSE WITH THAT THAT WAS MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN RELEASE ONE AND THAT THINGS WENT PRETTY WELL THERE. BUT THERE IS STILL A NEED REALLY TO MEET THAT THE I. T. NEEDS OF THESE REALLY THREE BOARDS IN BUREAU SO ABOUT HALF OF THAT BOARD OF YOURS IN THE DEPARTMENT STILL DIDN'T HAVE AN UPGRADED SYSTEM. SO THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTERESTED IN GETTING A PLAN FOR THAT. THAT SORT OF ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE ENTITIES AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE. WE DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT THAT PLAN SO BASICALLY. I COULD DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE. IN. THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT SUBMITTED A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THESE ENTITIES AND THIS WAS CALLED THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN. IT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY UPDATED IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. AND THIS IS REALLY A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH FROM WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED AND BREEZE DEGREES WAS GIVE ME THIS ONE SYSTEM IS GOING TO. KIND OF MEET THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE. BUT I THINK IT WAS SORT OF A LITTLE BIT OF A BUT I TEND TO TRY TO HAVE THIS. SORT OF. CATCH ALL. ONE SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE THIS WAS THIS NEW EFFORT IS BUSINESS MODERNIZATION EFFORT IS REALLY HAVE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. I THINK IT RECOGNIZE THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT BREEZE ENCOUNTERED OR SUMMIT CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED WERE AS A RESULT OF. A MAYBE AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF AN IDEA OF WHAT THESE ENTITY'S WOULD NEED IN THAT. AND PRACTICE ACTUALLY. THEY ARE VERY UNIQUE AND THEY HAD FRENCH KINDS OF BUSINESS NEEDS THAT REALLY NEEDED TO BE EVALUATED AND- MUCH MORE THOROUGH WAY. AND THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY WOULD HAVE DIFFERENT ULTIMATE I IS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SOLUTION WOULD BE FOR THEM SO MAYBE ONE SYSTEM WOULDN'T BE. WOULDN'T BE A SOLUTION FOR ALL OF THEM. SO IF YOU HAVE THAT CONSISTENT WITH THE FOCUS. BACK TO REVISED PLAN AND FOCUS. THAT THIS UNDER HIS ASIAN PLAN. VISION WARDS IN BUREAUS NOT DOING ONE IMPLEMENTATION ALTOGETHER BUT REALLY MOVING MORE AT THEIR OWN TIMELINE. ON THEIR LEVEL OF READINESS AND ALSO POTENTIALLY IMPLEMENTING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS SO INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE PRE SYSTEM THAT COVERS EVERYONE. SOME OF THESE ENTITIES YOU MIGHT BE ON DIFFERENT SYSTEMS AND IN FACT WILL HAVE THAT. FREE SYSTEM WHICH WILL COVER RELEASED ONE INTO THE BEER CANS CONTROL HAS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM. AND IT WORKS ACTING BAD THE RELEASE THREE ENTITIES TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE OTHER SYSTEM SO IT'LL BE. A FEW DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. SO THERE ARE REALLY VERY LEVELS OF PROGRESS TO DATE FOR THOSE RELEASED THREE BOARDS IN YOUR THINKING GO HERE PROBABLY MORE ABOUT THIS COMING UP. BUT. SEVEN TO DATE HAVE COMPLETED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND THOSE ARE THINGS LIKE ACTUALLY MAPPING WHAT THEIR BUSINESS PROCESSES ARE CURRENTLY AND WHAT THEY SHOULD BE. AND FOR HAVE COMPLETED THEIR ANALYSES OF PROJECT ALTERNATIVES AND REALLY HAVE PROPOSED A SORT OF KIND OF SOLUTION THAT THEY WANT TO UNDERTAKE AND THAT'S BASICALLY PHASE TWO OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS WHICH I THINK YOU'LL ALSO HEAR ABOUT. SHORTLY. SO ALSO IT'S DONE THE FIGURE ON PAGE FOR THESE ENTITIES AS TO HAVE DIFFERENT ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE SO THAT FIGURE SHOWS. ON THEM THE DEPARTMENT'S MOST RECENT ESTIMATES OF WHEN THESE VARIOUS PORTS IN EUROS WILL ACTUALLY BE FULLY TRANSITIONS THEIR NEW SYSTEMS SEE SEE THAT A NUMBER WILL BE. WILL BE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT THEY EXTEND ALL THE WAY OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO IT'LL BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE REALLY THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT HAS. UPGRADED IT SYSTEMS. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE WE JUST BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE THE RECENT BUDGET ACTION SO IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET. THERE WERE AND SIX DIFFERENT ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS TO HELP THEM MOVE FORWARD FORWARD WITH THEIR PROJECTS RELATES TO THE EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR THEIR PROJECTS. TO THESE ENTITIES ARE REALLY A DIFFERENCE SERVE EARLY RELATIVELY EARLY STAGES SOME OF THEM ARE STILL DOING A BUSINESS PROCESS EVALUATION SOME OF THEM HAVE COMPLETED PHASE TWO. OF THE STATE TO GET PROCESS. STAGE TWO BUT THEY'RE ALL STILL REFINING THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES OF SOME OF THEM HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY COST ESTIMATES BUT NOT THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES OF THIS FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION. IS WHAT WAS PROVIDED JUST FOR NINETEEN TWENTY AND A ONE TIME BASIS BUT THE FULL PROJECT COSTS AFTER THESE ENTITIES HAVEN'T BEEN FULLY ACCESS AT THIS POINT. I SOME HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS EITHER NOW OR OR AFTER THE MEETING SPEAKERS. OF THIS I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERS AND YOU NOT FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND THEN I KNOW I'VE GOT A FEW MONTHS. GREAT. GOOD MORNING I'M CHRIS SCHULTZ THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS I APPRECIATE THE OF TINA HIGHLIGHT THE SOLID WORK I THINK OUR TEAM IS DOING TO MOVE DC PROGRAMS TO NEW IT SYSTEMS THAT MEET THEIR BUSINESS NEEDS WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES FEAST IN ROLLING OUT BREEZEDURING THE FIRST RELEASE AYE YOUR PREDECESSORS HAD MANY OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND MY PREDECESSOR SAT AT THIS TABLE IN ANSWER TO A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS. DCA IS A INTERESTING DEPARTMENT WE HAVE IS HELL. MENTION NEARLY FORTY BOARDS BUREAUS COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS. EACH PROGRAM IS UNIQUE AND THEY ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTONOMY FOR EXAMPLE THE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS YOU'LL HEAR FROM LATER WE HAVE A GOVERNOR APPOINTED BOARD CAN OF THE BOARD OF CHARACTER JAMMERS MOSTLY APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR ONE SENATE ONE ASSEMBLY APPOINTEE. THEY HIRE THEIR OWN EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE APPOINTEES SO DC AXES AN UMBRELLA SOME OF THESE BOARDS ARE BECAUSE I AUTONOMOUS AND SO WE ACTED ACCORDING ROLE. BUT DON'T ALWAYS DIRECT FOLKS LIKE WE MIGHT IN A IN A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT THE FOLKS WHO RUN SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE THEIR SOME PROGRAMS THAT CEMETERY FUNERAL BIER WHERE THE DIRECTOR HIRES THAT BUREAU CHIEF AND- THE BULL CASES JUST ADVISER IT'S NOT A GOVERNING. BOARD BUT IT'S A I'M NOT GOING TO. HAVE DIFFERENT. WITH THE BREEZE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION DOESN'T WORK SO WE'VE MOVED TO. EIGHTY BUSINESS FOCUS PROCESS WHERE EACH PROGRAM IS IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT OF THEIR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. I WE THINK THAT THIS STRATEGIES ALREADY DEMONSTRATING SUCCESS BUREAU OF CANNABIS CONTROL IS BEING INCUBATED AT THE TO PUBLIC CONSUMER AFFAIRS THEY HAD A HARD STATUTORY DEADLINE FOR TILTING UP THEIR I. T. SYSTEM. WE MET THAT GOAL THERE IT SYSTEM WAS UP AND IT WORKS. TURNING BACK TO THE SEVENTEEN PROGRAMS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IT WOULD BE NAIVE TO PRESUME THERE MIGHT NOT BE CHALLENGES WE MIGHT HAVE NOT HAVE THIS SMALL DELAYS. BUT. IN TALKING TO ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS BOTH THE DC EIGHTEEN AND ALL THE BOYS AND GIRLS I'M I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. ON IT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOTE THAT WE APPRECIATE OUR PARTNERS ACT OUT DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THOSE TWO ENTITIES PROVIDE A LOT OF OVERSIGHT CDT APPROVED EACH OF THESE PROJECTS AT EVERY STAGE GATE. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ONLY PUTS THE MONEY IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY TEN BUDGET IF THEY THINK THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT TRACK. SO THERE ARE CONTROL AGENCIES LOOK AT THIS BEFORE. BEFORE JUST UP IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. BEFORE CLOSING I WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT DC IS STRIVING FOR AND NORMA'S TRANSPARENCY OUT WITH THESE PROJECTS. IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL REPORT WE'VE PRODUCED TWICE ON THIS PROJECT. AND THE OVERSIGHT THAT WE'VE RECEIVED IN THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES. AND THE LA HAS ENOUGH TO WEIGH IN ON THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES. ONE RECOMMIT TODAY TO MEETING WITH LEGISLATORS AND COMMITTEE STAFF AS FREQUENTLY AS YOU SEE FIT TO PROVIDE. FREQUENT UPDATES ON THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROJECT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS WHERE WE ARE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND HAVE IT ANSWERED QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING AGAIN MY NAME IS JASON Và CHURNING ON THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FOR DCA. IN ORDER TO BE NOT BE DUPLICATIVE I MIGHT JUMP INTO MY ROOM A LITTLE BIT DEEPER AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE HAVE ALREADY STATED SOME FACTS REGARDING BREEZE SO I'LL JUMP INTO IT. IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED THE CHALLENGES THAT BREEZE RELEASE ONE FACED WHAT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS TALKED ABOUT IS THE PIVOT THAT DCA EXECUTED IN ORDER TO. RIGHT RELEASED TO AND IMPLEMENT THAT SMOOTHLY AND EVEN LESS. WELL KNOWN IS THE ABILITY FOR THE RELEASE ONE FOUR TWO DID HAVE CHALLENGES EARLY ON TO MORE SMOOTHLY APPLY THEIR THAT BREEZE IMPLEMENTATION TO THEIR BUSINESS. AND ULTIMATELY GET ON BOARD AND RUN OPERATION SMOOTHLY WITH BREEZE SEVERAL LOTS OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE BREEZE IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHT JUST A COUPLE OF THEM NOW. WE LEARNED WE NEEDED A GREATER FOCUS ON ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BUSINESS WAS AN ACTIVE OWNER UNDERSTOOD THE EXPECTATIONS AND PARTICIPATION LEVELS AT ALL STAGES WE LEARNED OF THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS HAD TO DERIVE PRIMARILY FROM THE BOARDS IN BUREAUS THEMSELVES WILL NOT OVER VALUING SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE BOARDS OR UNDER VALUING DIFFERENCES. AND THE RELATED TO ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT WE LEARNED THAT VERY TIMELY TRAINING FOR STAFF WAS VERY HIGH ON OUR LIST OF LESSONS LEARNED. THE LESSONS OF THESE LESSONS LEARNED AS WELL AS NEW STATE PROJECT DIRECTOR AND PROJECT LEADERSHIP LED TO OF A VASTLY IMPROVED RELEASED TO. AND ALSO WITH THE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN. THE BEST ILLUSTRATION I COULD PROVIDE REGARDING THE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BREEZE TODAY ARE THE EVER INCREASING ONLINE ADOPTION RATES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE BOARD OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES. I NEED TO PER THEIR LICENSE RENEWAL THROUGH THE PRE SYSTEM ONLINE. BOARD OF REGISTERED NURSING HAD BOARD OF VOCATIONAL NURSING AT EIGHTY SIX AND RESPIRATORY CARE BOARD HAD NINETY ONE PERCENT. OF ALL OF THESE LICENSE RENEWALS 9295% OF THEM WERE DONE WITHOUT STAFF INTERVENTION. SO WE THINK THAT'S A VERY GOOD STAFF THAT CONTINUES TO GROW I CONTINUES TO SHOW THE FOR THE POSITIVE IMPACTS THE BREEZES HAD. THE FOCUS OF OUR DEPARTMENT IS MEETING ITS CLIENTS AND CUSTOMERS WHERE THEY ARE AT USING MOBILE AND ONLINE DEVICES TO CONDUCT THEIR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES AND SINCE THE BREEZE STABILIZATION OF BIRD BREEZE RELEASED TO IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE'VE EVOLVED THIS BUSINESS MODERNIZATION METHODOLOGY. AND HOW THE REMAINING SEVENTEEN BOARDS WOULD PLAN DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THEIR INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS MODERNIZATION MODERNIZATION INITIATIVES. THE NAME BUSINESS MODERNIZATION IS NOT BY CHANCE WE DO NOT CALL IT TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION OR EVEN AN IT PROJECT AT ALL WHILE THAT MIGHT SOUND COUNTERINTUITIVE WHAT I MEAN IS THAT WE LOOK TO IMPROVE BUSINESS PROCESSES AND SERVICE DELIVERY. BY HAVING OUR BOARD IN BUREAU SAID THE PROJECT OWNERS DRIVE DIRECT PARTICIPATE AND EXECUTE INITIATIVES ARE PROGRAMS BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR BUSINESS PROCESS PROPHECIES I CAN FIND BUSINESS IMPROVEMENTS IN REAL TIME THROUGH THIS EFFORT. THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE ANY MAJOR IT UPGRADE IS TAKING PLACE. HIS NAME IS NOT RE BRANDING OR SEMANTICS IT IS INDEED A PARADIGM SHIFT IN OUR THOUGHT PROCESS. WITHIN THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION FRAMEWORK OUR BOARDS IMPERIAL IS INITIATING DRIVE THESE PROJECTS PARTNER WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THE CA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. DCA BOTH PART AND PROVIDES OVERSIGHT THROUGHOUT THE BUSINESS MONITOR THIS MODERNIZATION ACTIVITIES. EARLY COLLABORATIONS INCLUDE THE CREATION OF PROCESS MAPS AND FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS WITH THE DCA ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT OFFICE. ADDITIONAL CLOSE COLLABORATION OCCURS THROUGH THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE THE PAL PROCESS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND EXECUTION OCCURS WITH PCA'S OFFICE OF INFORMATION SERVICES THE PILLARS OF BUSINESS MODERNIZATION STRUCTURE ARE NO NGUYEN DOCUMENT YOUR BUSINESS. FOSTER AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT IS ENCOURAGED ACTED UPON. IDENTIFYING DOCUMENT BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FROM A PROGRAM SPECIFIC PERSPECTIVE NOT AN AMALGAMATION OF DEPARTMENT WIDE REQUIREMENTS UNDERSTAND RESOURCE DEMANDS AT EVERY STEP OF THE PROCESS TO AVOID COSTLY DIGITAL DELAYS. AND POTENTIALLY CARVE OUT DEDICATED RESOURCES WERE POSSIBLE. AND PARTNER WITH KEY STAKEHOLDER GROUPS TO EXPERTLY IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVE. OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODERNIZATION SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINES RUN FROM TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUGH I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THESE TIME LINES REPRESENT THE END OF THESE RESPECTIVE PROJECTS. IF WE LOOK AT THE TARGETED DATES FOR INITIAL DELIVERY OF ONLINE SERVICES TO PUBLIC CONSTITUENTS THE TIME LINES ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF OUR AGILE APPROACH. SIX BOARDS IN BUREAUS% WILL IMPLEMENT INITIAL ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FIVE IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FOUR IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND ONLY ONE IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. TO BE SPECIFIC THE LONGEST PROJECT DATE ONLY REPRESENTS ONE OF OUR BOARDS. AND WE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN ACTIVITIES WITH THEM WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH THAT BOARD'S LEADERSHIP TWO X. TO REFINE AND ACCELERATE THE PROJECT DATES. THESE INITIAL TIME LINES WERE DETERMINED WITH A PRAGMATIC APPROACH OUR PROGRAMS WERE ASKED TO CREATE INVENTORY OF BUSINESS PROCESSES WE OVERLAID A STANDARD DURATION FOR THOSE BUSINESS PROCESSES. WE THEN ADDED ON THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE DURATION ON THE AVERAGE PRICE OF PROJECT APPROVAL I CYCLE DURATION. AND THEN WE IMPLANT WE ADDED ON A TWELVE OR EIGHTEEN MONTH PROJECT EXECUTION. TIME LINES WERE THEN OVERLAID WITH STAFF CONSTRAINTS TO CREATE AN OVERALL SEVENTEEN PROGRAM BUSINESS MODERNIZATION LANDSCAPE. OUR FIRST FOUR PROGRAMS REFER TO AS BUSINESS MODERNIZATION COHORT ONE INCLUDES THE BOARD OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS LAND SURVEYORS AND GEOLOGISTS THE BOARD FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION THE ACUPUNCTURE BOARD AND THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS. THESE FOUR PROGRAMS UNDERTOOK BUSINESS MODERNIZATION INDIVIDUALLY AND THROUGH OUR STRUCTURE PROCESS IDENTIFIED SHARED REQUIREMENTS AND COST SAVINGS AREAS THAT WERE BENEFICIAL ENOUGH TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS AS A GROUP. COURT ONE HAS TARGETED PROJECTS START DATE OF WINTER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WITH A FIRST RELEASE OF FUNCTIONALITY THE PUBLIC SEVEN MONTHS LATER. AN INCREMENTAL OR AGILE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WILL DELIVER THE REMAINING REQUIREMENTS EVERY FIVE TO SIX SIX WEEKS THEREAFTER. ALL THE REMAINING THIRTEEN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE ENTERED BUSINESS MODERNIZATION HAVE REALIZED CONCRETE BUSINESS VALUE AHEAD OF ANY NEW OR MODIFIED I. T. SYSTEM. THE WORK PERFORMED BY THE DCA ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT OFFICE TO IDENTIFY AND DOCUMENT BUSINESS PROCESS PERFORMING PROVEN ANALYSIS AND OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS TO CREATE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS HAS GARNERED RAVE REVIEWS. I'M SURE YOU HAVE MORE ABOUT THIS FROM ROBERT COOLEY OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS LATER. I DID PREVIOUSLY TALK ABOUT TIME LINES THAT EXTENDED OUT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT MAKING PROGRESS IN THE INTERIM THERE ARE INCREMENTAL NEEDS THAT ARE BEING MET NOW. OUR APPROACH INCLUDES GROWING A ROBUST ECOSYSTEM THAT OVER TIME COULD BE MORE AGILE IN DEALING WITH CHANGES IN SERVICE DELIVERY. TO PROVIDE ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS GROWING ECOSYSTEM SINCE DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AN ONLINE RENEWAL POKE PORTAL FOR SIX OF THE SEVENTEEN PROGRAM BORDEN BUREAUS MARCHING THROUGH BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. AND TWO MORE WILL COME ONLINE WITHIN THE NEXT FORTY FIVE DAYS. RECENTLY THE BOARD OF PHARMACY AT ONE OF AT A BOARD MEETING REPORTED THAT 40% OF THEIR RENEWALS WERE BEING HANDLED WITH OR WITHOUT STAFF INTERVENTION THROUGH THE ONLINE PORTAL. THEIR EXACT THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR THE PART POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS WILL SUBMIT SUBMIT ANNUAL REPORTS THROUGH AN ONLINE PORTAL INSTEAD OF THE PREVIOUS PAPER BASED AND MANUAL PROCESS THIS HAS RECEIVED VERY POSITIVE REVIEWS FROM THE BUREAU SAID. SCHOOL POPULATION ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS A DC IT'S OPEN DATA PORTAL LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THIS TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT STATISTICAL DATA REAR OVER YEAR TRANS AND AN INTERACTIVE INTERFACE FOR OUR DATA PARTNERS AND THE PUBLIC AND THE LAST EXAMPLE IS ALREADY BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT BUT I WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE CANNABIS PROJECT THIS WAS A HIGHLY VISIBLE AND COMPLEX PROJECT THE VERY TIGHT MANDATED IMPLEMENTATION DATE. WE WERE SUCCESSFUL DUE IN PART TO THE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION DOCTOR THAT OUTLINED TODAY THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE TECHREPUBLIC TECHREPUBLIC IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WITH THE BEST OF CALIFORNIA WARD AS AN OUTSTANDING PROJECT AND WE WERE WE RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT WE WERE ONE OF THREE FINALISTS FOR NATIONAL. RECOGNITION FOR THE SAME PROJECT. TO SUMMARIZE WE HAVE DEVELOPED A METHODOLOGY THAT WILL GUIDE THE LARGER DCA COMMUNITY TOWARDS AN ENVIRONMENT OF BUSINESS DRIVEN THOUGHTFUL IMPROVEMENT. TO THE WAY DCA BOARDS EMBARRASSED DELIVER SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. WE BELIEVE WE ARE CREATING A MODEL AT THE DEPARTMENT BY WHICH OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES CAN FOLLOW. THANK YOU. THANKS CAN YOU JUST CHECK OUT A QUICK STEP BACK FOR ME AND JUST SUMMARIZE WHAT WHAT ARE WHAT WERE THE GOALS FOR THE VISITS MODERN STATION PROJECT WHEN YOU TECH LEADERSHIP THE GOALS FOR THE BIZ MODERNIZATION. ALL TAKE A LITTLE HALF THAT BACK IN STATE TO CREATE THE BIT THAT STRUCTURE A PLAN THAT COULD FIT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS. IN BUREAU STRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN ANY PROJECT GOING FORWARD AND TO CLARIFY THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAD IN BREEZE WERE BOTH RELATED TO. WORK ACROSS THE BOARD THE CHALLENGES WERE ACROSS THE BOARD AND- ALSO INCLUDED THE STRUCTURE THAT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BOARDS AND BUREAUS. SO BY KNOWING HAVING KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THOSE CHALLENGES I WANTED TO CREATE A PLAN THAT WOULD. ENGAGE THE BOARDS AND GROWS IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE. AND CREATES. AND EMPLOYMENT ALL THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM BREEZE SO THAT WAS THE- IDEAS OF CREATING A PLAN. AND THE GOALS WERE. ONE FOR THE BOARD IN GROSS TO IDENTIFY THEIR BUSINESS PROCESS AND HAVE A VERY GOOD GRASP THOROUGH GRASP OF THE BUSINESS PROCESSES THEMSELVES. AND BEFORE YOU DO WE JUMP TO I. T. TO GO THROUGH AN IMPROVEMENT PROCESS. BECAUSE WE'VE ALL HEARD IT WHY'D YOU DO THAT WHY DO YOU MOVE A FILE FROM ONE DESK TO ANOTHER BECAUSE WE'VE DONE IT THAT WAY FOR THIRTY YEARS WE WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE LOOKED AT THAT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE IMPROVE THOSE PROCESSES BEFORE WE IMPLEMENTED INTO A POTENTIAL NEWTECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. AND THEN ULTIMATELY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THAT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM SOME SPECIFIC GOALS I SPOKE ABOUT WE WANTED TO ENGAGE OUR CONSTITUENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT IN THEIR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES WE WANT OUR CONSTITUENTS TO BE ABLE TO RENEW ON THE MOBILE DEVICE. WE HAVE MOST OF OUR. I HEARD A STATISTIC 71% OF PEOPLE'S SOUL COMPUTING DEVICES THEIR MOBILE PHONE AND SO ON IN KNOWING THAT. WE WANTED TO MAKE THE RENEWAL PROCESS WHICH IS OUR LARGEST VOLUME TRACK ACTION BY BY FAR AS EASY AS PULLING OUT YOUR MOBILE PHONE POTENTIALLY WITH ONE HAND AND TO BE ABLE TO RENEW YOUR LICENSE AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR WITH. ANY NEW PLATFORMS TO COME ON SPECIFICALLY COHORT ONE EVEN THE BREEZE HAS A VERY WELL USED AND. INTUITIVE INTERFACE FOR RENEWALS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE JUST LIKE AMAZON AND ALL THE OTHER UBIQUITOUS ONLINE PLAYERS WITH REGARD TO YOU TOO THE USER INTERFACE AND EASE. GOT IT OKAY SO MOBILE FUNCTION IT WAS IN A FROM A CONSTITUENT PERSPECTIVE A CONSTITUENT CALL. ANYTHING ELSE IN TERMS AS- NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS FIVE PROCESSING TIMES ALL OF THE S. APOLOGIZE YEAH THAT. ARE THERE ANY SPECIFIC THINGS YOU CAN SHARE WITH US THAT YOU ALL SET OUT AS GOALS THAT I IS A YOU KNOW CALIFORNIAN. WEIGHED. APPRECIATE SURE I'LL SPEAK TO EACH OF THE STAGE ONE WHICH IS THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE FOR DEPARTMENT CONSUME UP DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THE STAGE ONE OUTLINES THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY PROBLEMS AND OPPORTUNITIES. ALL OF THE STAGE ONES FOR THE SEVEN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMPLETED THAT TODAY ALL HAVE BASS LINE. TIME FRAMES FOR APPLICATION PROCESSING AND COMPLETE RESOLUTION WITH TARGETS UP FOR. IMPROVEMENT I KEEP I WOULD THROW OUT AT A CAN'T REMEMBER A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT ALL THE BOARD SAY STATE THAT WE CURRENTLY DO THIS IN A HUNDRED AND TWO DAYS ON AVERAGE AND WITH IT AFTER SIX MONTHS OF IMPLEMENTATION OUR TARGET IS TO DO IT WITHIN FORTY NINE DAYS. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE ALL OF THE STATE ONES HAVE THOSE TARGETS FOR LICENSING PROCESSING TIMES AS WELL AS COMPLAINT TIME FRAMES AND MOST IF NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE INVESTIGATION TIME TARGET BASELINE TARGET IMPROVEMENTS AS THOSE AS THOSE GOALS AND- AT THE PART WHEN THE PROJECT IS FINISHED WE LOOK BACK TO THE STAGE ONE TO MAKE SURE WE CHECKED OFF THOSE BOXES TO ALL THE OBJECTIVES. THAT WERE IDENTIFIED EARLY OKAY GOT IT THANK YOU. QUESTIONS AB MEMBERS MISTER GLORIA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND JUST THE FROM THE TOP I'M GONNA KNOWLEDGE. THIS IS TOUGH STUFF I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND WE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. BUT WHEN REVIEWING THE LA COMMENTS. THERE IS A SENSE IN YEAH I UNDERSTAND I CAN ARGUE THE OPPOSITE BASS TO COME AWAY FROM A SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TEMP WITH PRES OVER A LOT OF YEARS. HE GOT SUPER EXPENSIVE IT WASN'T EVER FULLY IMPLEMENTED. NOW WE'VE MOVED TO BUSINESS MODERNIZATION AND AT LEAST WITHIN THE- THE CHART. RIGHT THAT YOU YOU HAVE A REALLY LIKE THE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE NO FIRM. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SO CONVINCED ME THIS ISN'T HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF. I CAN ANSWER THAT I CAN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THAT IT'S- NOT IT'S NOT HISTORY REPEATING ITSELF FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS WE ACTUALLY ALL OF THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM BREEZE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE HUNDRED AND 80 DEGREES OPPOSITE OF THOSE STRATEGIES FIRST THE ALSO ALL. ALL ONE SIZE ONE SIZE FITS ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WAS THE ROOF BUT A ROUTE TO FOUNDATIONAL PROBLEM AND THAT HAS BEEN. THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ALLOW. TO ALLOW THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BOARD EMBARRASSED TO SHINE THROUGH IN THIS PROCESS SO LET ME HOP IN THERE BECAUSE I WAS IT SEEMS LIKE A DIFFERENT PHILOSOPHY ONE SIZE FITS ALL WAS FINE WITH PRES IMPLEMENTATION NOW WE DECIDED THAT'S NOT THE CASE. BUT YOU HAVE THE FIRST TWO PHASES A BREEZE. OUT THERE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY FOR THESE OTHER ONES THAT ARE NON BREEZE A WELL PLAYED TO SOMEONE IN YOUR ROLE YOURSELF OR OTHERS OUR SUCCESSORS DECIDE. THESE TWO NEED TO COMMUNICATE TO ONE ANOTHER WE NEED TO GO BACK TO ONE SIZE FITS ALL. IN WEEK THE COULD NEW VENDORS ONLY TOO HAPPY TO SELL US THAT TECHNOLOGY AGAIN HAD UNDETERMINED BUDGET OF COURSE I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. THE REASON AND I WON'T GET TOO TECHNICAL PLEASE DON'T I WILL I WILL. I'LL SAY THIS A WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THAT EXACT IDEA OF AN ECOSYSTEM AND- EVERYTHING TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER WE ALREADY HAVE BUT THE BREEZE SYSTEM. TALKING TO THE MAIN FRAME SYSTEM THAT THAT THE OTHER SEVENTEEN BOARDS AND BE OUR SHOES WE HAVE IT. INTEGRATED BEEN TALKING FOR REPORTING FOR ONLINE JUST BEFORE THE OPEN DATA PORTAL THAT I SPOKE ABOUT. SO ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS GOING FORWARD A COHORT ONE AND HE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PLAN WHY FOR IS THE INTEGRATION INTO THAT ECOSYSTEM SO IT TALKS TO BRIEF SO APPROXIMATE CAN. PLATFORM AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT IT EXISTS IT IS A KEY PART KEY A KEY REQUIREMENT. SO WE DON'T. WE DON'T MAKE SIDE LOAD NEW SYSTEM OKAY WE MAKE AN ENTIRE A COMMUNITY OF SYSTEM THAT IN RATE. FOR COMMUNICATION. LA US TO TEST. THE PEOPLE AT THE HAPPIEST IN THE EQUATION THE ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE STAFF AND CERTAINLY THE TAXPAYERS ARE NOT HAPPY SO ON THIS LAST PAGE OF THE LA AS REPORT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE AND A HALF MILLION THAT WAS IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. I RECOGNIZE THAT ACCORDING TO THE TIME WHEN YOU'VE PROVIDED THIS GOES OUT TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO YOU HAVE. FIVE ADDITIONAL YEARS WHAT'S THE PROJECTED COST I RECOGNIZE IT'S DANGEROUS. GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT BUT- DOES ANYONE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT. OVER ALL THESE YEARS WHAT THAT FIGURE IS GOING TO BE TWENTY FIVE MY SUCCESSORS SITTING HERE WHAT WILL THEY SAID WHAT WOULD THEY BE FACED WITH. IS A HARD QUESTION TO SEE IF I CAN ADD AS BEST I CAN. SO WE'LL TAKE A BALLPARK FIGURE. AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ONE FOR YOU I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE DISAPPOINTED BUT LET ME EXPLAIN. SO WE HAVE SEVENTEEN SMALL PROJECTS THAT ARE MOVING. ON DIFFERENT TIMELINES SO INSTEAD OF DOING ONE BIG PROJECT WE'RE DOING SEVENTEEN SMALL PROJECTS AND THAT'S THE WAY IT'S BUDGET THAT'S WHY IT'S APPROVED BY CALIFORNIA BIOTECHNOLOGY. TO WAIT TO PROVIDE DEPARTMENT ANTS. SO WE'VE SEVENTY SMALL PROJECTS MOVING. THEY ARE. LET'S SEE. THE FOR PROGRAMS THAT JASON. ALLEN THAT ARE IN THERE IT'S THEIR AT THEIR. MOVING INTO THE THIRD STAGE GATE WE'RE GONNA GET A FIRM COST ON THOSE PRETTY SOON. AND THAT'S THE FIRST COHORT GOING THROUGH. THE OTHER ONES ARE INCOME THE LEGISLATIVE PARLANCE THERE IN THE FIRST HOUSE POLICY COMMITTEE OR THEY'RE JUST A BILL IDEA THAT HASN'T EVEN BEEN ANALYZED YET. SO YOU'RE ASKING ME NOW THE CHAMBER THE SECOND HOUSE YEAH FISCAL ON WHAT IS THIS BILL REALLY COST AND I AM TRYING TO DESCRIBE THAT WERE AT THE- END OF THE THIRTY DAYS WHEN YOU'RE BILLS AND PRINT BEGAN AMENDED WHERE THEY'RE ON A BUNCH OF THESE PROJECTS. IT'S TOO EARLY TO ASK THAT QUESTION I THINK IS ONE. OF THE SENATE MAY DO RIGHT CORRECT. ASKING THE QUESTION BECAUSE WITH BREEZE START AT TWENTY MILLION ENDS UP THREEFOLD OF THAT WE STILL THINK IT WE WANT. ARE THE CONTRACTS BEING CRAFT IN A DIFFERENT WAY SUCH THAT THE VENDOR MAY NOT GO BEYOND THEY WERE EXPLAINING VERY CLEARLY WHAT WE WANT THIS IS AN ALL IN COST YOU BID FOR IT THAT'S IT. I'M ARE WE LEAVING THESE OPEN ENDED BECAUSE WHEN YOU AYE AYE PRETTY THE NABLUS THIS OF THE COST IN THE CHANGED ENVIRONMENT BUT HE DOES A LOT YOU CAN DO TO THE CONTRACTING VEHICLE TAKE LESS ON THE HOOK FOR. UNEXPECTED I'M SO I'M SO GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. I WILL SAY THE CONTRACT STRUCTURE THE IN. CONTRACT STRUCTURE. IS TO DUPLICATE WHAT WE DID WITH THE CANNABIS PROJECT OKAY AND IT WAS A CONTRACT STRUCTURE. THAT ALLOWED US TO MANAGE. RISK THROUGH. THE CONTRACT ITSELF. I WILL SAY THAT YOU. HIT ON THE HEAD WITH REGARD TO A CONTRACT. BEING FLEXIBLE AND WE DID NOT HAVE THAT ARE IN THE BREEZE. PROJECT HAD WE IT COULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IT WASN'T. AND WE LEARNED FROM THAT. THE SH THE CONTRACT IS SUCH THAT FOR IT FOLLOWS THE AN AGILE APPROACH. SO WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS WERE ABLE TO. IF IN THE SECOND MONTH THE VENDOR COMES IN AND IS NOT ABLE TO. DELIVER WERE ABLE TO RID MANAGE RISK AT THAT POINT. AND HAVE IT. WE'RE NOT LOCKED INTO A CONTRACT AND IT'S- I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S OPEN AND IT'S JUST. THE INTENDED STRUCTURE IS WAY MORE FLEXIBLE. THAN IN THE PAST. AND WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THE RISK OF A- OF SPEND. TAXPAYER DOLLARS ON THESE PROJECTS. DON'T ANTICIPATE NOT SUCCEEDING HERE. BUT WE DO HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THAT RISK CAN I CLARIFY ONE THING FOR YOU YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE- CHART THAT TALKED ABOUT THE EXTENDED TIME LINES. I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT TO TIE THE BUDGET NUMBER THE FIVE POINT FIVE. TO JUST ONE PROJECT THE FIRST FOUR COHORT ONE WHICH ISN'T THE PROJECT COMPLETION IS TARGETED FOR TWELVE THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE AT THIS POINT YES SO THAT THAT ONE PROJECT FOR THE FOR. IS TIED TO THAT TIME LINE TIED TO THAT BUDGET YEAH AND THOSE WITH THAT ADDS. UP. MISTER SCHULTZ SAID WILL CONTINUE TO PROBABLY GROUP TOGETHER THE OTHER PRO THE OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE SIMILARITY IN REQUIREMENTS AND COST SAVING AREAS. AND SO WILL. THAT COSTS WILL COME TOGETHER AS WE GO THROUGH STAGE GATE WITH EACH OF THOSE PROJECTS THE NEXT ONE MAY VERY BUILT VERY WELL BE FIVE OR SIX PROGRAMS TOGETHER YEAH SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT. ARE JUST TRYING TO YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WHO THEY'RE GONNA CALL IF THIS COMES IN AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL RIGHT AND WHO'S GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND- YOUTH. I MEAN ME RIGHT. THIS IS WHAT MAKES US BUT ONCE TRY AND UNDERSTAND LOVE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BE AT FIVE DOLLARS FIVE MILLION WHICH MIGHT. BE I THINK I CAN UP THE FACT THAT IS NOT THE CASE THE FIGURE WILL BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU TELLING ME THAT THE CAN THAT CONTRACTING VEHICLES WILL BE AS TIGHT AS POSSIBLE TO YOU TO MANAGE THE RISK. MY LAST OBSERVATION WOULD JUST SIMPLY BE THAT THE TIME HER EYES WERE TOP TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SIX YEAR. HORIZON FOR IMPLEMENTATION NO FEAR I HAVE ALSO THAT IT WOULD JUST EXPRESSES THAT OF COURSE SIX YEARS NOT A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE PLANNING FOR I RECOGNIZE IT'S EARLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE. PROCESS CAN CHANGE. BUT THAT TIME AS IN. I WANT TO MS IN INSTANTLY OBSOLETE HI. I'VE TAKEN PLENTY OF THE TIMES AND VENTURE THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE I WOULD JUST WRAPPED UP BY AND I RECOGNIZE IT'S EASY TO THROW STONES FROM OUTSIDE I DON'T. HAVE ALL THE IDEAS OF. EVEN I'M GREAT. PEOPLE. THE QUESTION TO ANSWER. I WOULD ASK YOU BY THE HARDEST PART POSSIBLE YOU KNOW PUSH THE VENDORS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THESE COMPANIES HAVE THE MONEY THEY CAN GET THIS STUFF DONE I ALWAYS BET ON PEOPLE LIKE US NOT STAYING LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THE CONTRACT ALL THE WAY THROUGH SO I HOPE THAT YOU ARE BODY AND HERE FOR THE LONG HAUL TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE GETS CUTE. ON THESE DOLLARS I APPLAUD THE GOAL OVERALL I CAN'T THINK OF ANY I CAN'T THINK OF A LOW HANGING FRUIT IN TERMS OF BOLSTERING CONFIDENCE PUBLIC AND WHAT THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT IS DOING IN THE MOBILE FUNCTIONALITY THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I WISH THAT THERE ARE OTHER INDICATORS THAT THEY WOULD EXCEPT FOR TRUST FOR ME BUDGET. EASE USE AN AGE. WAS ON WHAT NOT. BUT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS STUFF IS EASILY. I UNDERSTAND BY YOUR TESTIMONY THAT YOU GET THAT. YOU'RE WORKING NATURAL DIRECTION. AND COMMUNICATING THAT TODAY'S IS PRETTY IS A IS A GOOD THING. NOW IT'S ALL THE EXECUTION AND SO I WISH YOU LUCK IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I HOPE. YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE ANY STONES THROWN. ON BY THE GET THE GENERAL SENSE THAT VALUES REALLY IMPORTANT. MAINTAINING A PHILOSOPHY OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO GOING FROM ONE SIZE TO. DISTRIBUTE IT. I WAS A NUMBER OF REASONS NO MORE OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER GORE AT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. TO A SHARED I SHARES NUMBER THE CONCERNS AROUND THE LACK OF A CLEAR BUDGETS AND IT SEEMS TO BE. STE IT'S A CRAZY LONG TIME LINE SO. ANY THAT THIS THIS ITERATION OF THE PROJECT COMMENCED TWO YEARS AGO BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR TEN YEARS IT'S REALLY REALLYHARD FOR ME TO WRAP MY ARMS AROUND HOW IT'S POSSIBLE NOT TO BE BEYOND THE SCOPING PHASE AND NOT TO EVEN HAVE KIND A BALLPARK FIGURE. ON HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST AND- I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU HAVE COME FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR BUT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THERE'S NOT A COMPANY IN THE WORLD. WHERE YOU CAN SAY. I'LL WE GOT SAID. AND PROJECTS AND WE'RE JUST GONNA KEEP THE MALL RUNNING WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MUCH THEY'RE GONNA COST BED. JUST TRUST US TO KEEP DOING THIS FOR SIX MORE YEARS THAT. REALLY FEELS CRAZY TO ME. AND I DO WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO. GET A BETTER HANDLE ON HOW MUCH THIS IS GOING TO COST AND- AND PUSH FOR THAT CLARITY. AND SECOND. I WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT WOULD IT TAKE. TO TURN THE STUFF AROUND IN YOUR TWO YEARS INSTEAD OF SIX YEARS BECAUSE I SHARE. YOU MISTER GLORIA POINTED OUT. PROJECTED TIMELINE. IT'S BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS CHANGE THE WORLD CHANGES IN SIX YEARS. MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS ARE FOUNDED BELT SOLD SIX YEARS THIS SEEMS REALLY REALLY TOO LONG FOR ME TO A- IT'S JUST TO TAKE A PLEA. PROCESS RE ENGINEERING PROJECT BOB CHECK IS THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU GUYS TO GET A BETTER IDEA OF AN OVERALL BUDGET AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO DELIVER THIS PROJECT IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY IN A MUCH SHORTER. AMOUNT OF TIME. TO GET TAKE TO GET TO A MORE CONCRETE BUDGET FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROCESS. I'M GOING TO SAY THAT. IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF GOOD ESTIMATES AND BASS AND IT WE WOULD WE WOULD HAVE TO BASE IT ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH CANNABIS AND PERHAPS THE FIRST COHORT TO GET TO. A CONCRETE FOR THE ENTIRETY FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROJECT AND I EVEN HEDGING SAYING THAT ONLY BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCES THAT ARE VERY VERY APPARENT IN OUR BOARDS IN BUREAUS THE SIZES THE COMPLEXITIES THE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. IT CETERA ARE SO VARIED ALONG A SPECTRUM OF EVERYTHING THAT WEEK AND THAT COULD POSSIBLY THINK OF THAT TO. PUT THE PUT EACH IN A BOX AND COME UP WITH THAT A GOOD ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT I WOULD FEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE WAY THAT NUMBER WOULD BE OFF OF HIM HOWEVER ACADEMICALLY I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO COME UP WITH THE NEXT ESTIMATE BASED ON A LOT OF COBB YACHTS AND- THAT'S AND- ASSUMPTIONS. SOME PM AT MID MATCH UP IN IN. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THIS BACK AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION NIGHT WHAT WILL COMMIT TO GETTING BACK TO YOU I THINK. THE CONCERN IS THAT AT THIS POINT. IF PUSH FOR IT ESTIMATES WE WOULD GIVE. AND ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HOPE TO UNDERSTOOD RIGHT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO GO OVER BUDGET RIGHT SO WE WOULD WHATEVER ESTIMATE WE DEVELOPED AND- ASSEMBLYMEMBER GLORIA WAS JUST PUSHING US TO GET A GREAT DEAL WITH THE VENDORS SO I KIND OF DON'T WANT TO SEND A PRICE SIGNAL IT'S BIGGER THAN WE THINK WE CAN DELIVER GREAT SO IT PUTS US IN A BOX SEAT RIGHT IF. IF WE ESTABLISH AN OVERALL BUDGET THAT'S THE OUTSIDE BOUNDARY OF WHAT WE MIGHT SPEND AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO GET A BETTER DEAL FROM THE VENDORS IT PUTS US IN A IN A DIFFICULT BOX THIS ALSO RELATES TO ACCOMPANY APARTMENT TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT FINANCE HOW THE WHOLE STATE BUDGET THESE THINGS THAT'S A LITTLE BEYOND MY REVENGE ISN'T. SO WHAT. SAID TAKING A CALL. BACK IN A GETTING BACK. THERE. IT'S GOING TO ADD ONE ONE OTHER LITTLE THING WHICH MIGHT MIGHT HELP A LITTLE BIT. SEEMS LIKE PART OF THE CHALLENGES. IS SORT OF THIS PROJECT REAL LIFE CYCLE PROCESS WHICH WAS PUT IN PLACE FOR. YOU TO PROVIDE A REASON FOR A LOT OF CHALLENGES ASSOCIATE WITH THE PREVIOUS PROCESS. BUT AS I UNDERSTAND THAT USED TO ONE OF THE- PIECES OF THAT PROCESS IS. IS THAT OF. THROUGH THAT THAT PROJECT APPROVAL ICICLE PROCESS. THAT THE COSTS ARE REFINED INTO THERE'S SORT OF AN- BY AT STAGE TWO THEY HAVE THESE. ROUGH ESTIMATES ASSEMBLY FOLKS SOMEBODY'S ENTITIES ACTUALLY DO HAVE YOU KNOW ROUGH ESTIMATES I THINK A LOT OF MORE AROUND LIKE MAYBE FOUR MILLION. EACH FOR EACH THESE ENTITIES. SERVE IN THAT BALLPARK ALTHOUGH IT COULD VERY BRIGHT. BUT THAT'S A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE AND THAT WILL WILL CHANGE OVER TIME FINANCIALLY. AND SO THAT'S SORT OF A STAGE TO BUT THEY DON'T REALLY REFINE THOSE ESTIMATES AND TELL ANSWER OF ACTUALLY HAVE A FULL. PROJECT BUDGET INTO REALLY THAT PROJECT APPROVAL EXCEPT THE PROCESS IS MORE TOWARD. THE END OF COMPLETION. AND I THINK. THAT IS IT SO THAT IT. IS A REALISTIC. BOB PROJECT BUDGET AND- THAT. IS SOMETHING WE. CAN REALLY HOLD. ACCOUNTABLE AND WHAT HAVE. YOU. THROUGHOUT THE LIFE WHEN SHOULD YOU. ENGINE IS YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE'S PRESENTED WITH THE PROPOSAL'S LIKE WE LIKE THE LEGISLATURE SIGNED NINETEEN TWENTY IN THE BUDGET FOR OKAY YEAH CAN YOU PLEASE APPROVE THIS FIRST YEAR OF FINDING RIGHT BUT AT THAT POINT IS THE FIRST YOU'RE FUNNY BUT- THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL PROJECT AS- THERE'S NO YEAH AND SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT HARD SO WE ACTUALLY HAD SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND I THINK THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND WE HAD SOME PREDICTIONS FOR SOME BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE ON THOSE. ULTIMATELY WHAT INCLUDED BUT IN THE BUDGET BUT I THINK THERE'S A KIND OF THINGS LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE HOW DO WE HAVE THAT OVERSTAFFED. WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE FUN THOSE INITIAL ACTIVITIES BUT ALSO HOW DO WE SORT OF NOT FIND MORE THAN WE NEED TO WITHOUT A CLEAR THE ON HOW MUCH THE PROJECT IS GOING. TO COST AND WHETHER THAT'S WORTH IT. AND SO THOSE ARE THE TOP. THE LIGHT SAYS IT. INSTRUCT. A LITTLE BIT AS WELL THANKS A THAT SPAHN AND AT MISMATCH HADDOCK. BUT I HAVE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT CONCEPT SO I COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AS A MATTER OF STANDARD PRACTICE IN OUR MOST SIZABLE PROJECTS PARTICULARLY AROUND TECH IMPLEMENTATION OR BUILDING STRUCTURES WE HAD A TWO PART OUR FEE PROCESS AS OF THE FIRST PART WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR SCOPING OF THE PROJECT. AND AN ESTIMATE WHICH COULD EVEN BE AS I UNDERSTAND NOT WANTING TO SIGNAL TO THE BIDDING MARKET RIGHT THAT THAT THIS IS WHAT YOUR RANGE IS BUT TOOK THAT COULD BE USED AS AN INTERNAL. KIND OF GUIDE POST IF YOU WILL ESPECIALLY IN THESE MAJOR MULTI MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT. IS THAT A PRACTICE THAT. OCCURS NOW IS AT A PRACTICE THAT YOU WOULD BE. OPEN TO BECAUSE AGAIN ANY GUARD RAILS THAT WE CAN SET IN PLACE AROUND HOW WE'RE USING THE PUBLIC'S MONEY. TO THE TO THE BEST A FACT AND NOT KIND OF WRITING THIS OPEN ENDED CHECK I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEES PRESENT HERE TODAY TO TRY TO ESTABLISH. I THINK THIS STRUCTURE THAT STAGE GATE STRUCTURE FOR THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE. AND MAYBE SEE A DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY COULD SPEAK TO IT A LITTLE BIT MORE WHEN THEY IN THE SECOND PANEL. IT DOES. BUT NATURALLY. DIVIDE ITSELF INTO THE FIRST TWO STAGES ARE THE PLANNING EFFORTS. AND THEN THE SECOND THE THIRD AND FOURTH STAGE ARE THE- PROCUREMENT IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION STAGES. AND SO. THE IT IS NATURAL IN THAT PROCESS TO IF REQUIRED FIND THE INITIAL STAGES AFTER AN APPROVED STAGE TWO IS WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO GET FUNDING FOR THAT THE PLANNING STAGES. AND THEN THE THIRD AND FOURTH IS WHEN WE GET PROJECT FUNDING. AND ARE THE VENDORS WHO VET WHO BID IN THE FIRST PART OF THAT PROCESS THEN ELIGIBLE TO BID ON THE RIM THEY THE PROJECT ITSELF. POTENTIALLY THEY WOULD BE DIFFERENT VENDOR OFFERINGS THAT THE PLANNING WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE PROJECT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS ANALYST TYPE OF FACILITATION WHEREAS THE SECOND PHASE THE EXECUTION WOULD BE. SYSTEM INTEGRATION TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL RELATED CONTRACTORS. AND YOU WHO ARE THE VENDORS THAT YOU'VE ENGAGED WITH FOR THE MODERNIZATION PLAN WERE GETTING READY FOR THE STAGE THREE PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES PROCUREMENT SO THAT SOLICITATION IS STILL IT WILL BECOME WILL BE OKAY FOR THERE'S BEEN NO NEW NEW NEW VENDORS APPOINTED AS YET. OKAY ENTER WHO IS DOING STAGES ONE AND TWO THAT'S BEEN AN INTERNAL EFFORTS LED BY YOUR TEAM CORRECT. THREE DIFFERENT PHASE IT THREE DIFFERENT GROUPS WITHIN DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS AT A LARGE CONTINGENT OF BOREDOM BUREAU I'M A CONTINGENT ABOARD EMBARRASSED OFF ALSO. WHO'S ON YOUR TEAM. I RUN THE OFFICE EVEN FOR SO IT THE- PEOPLE BANG ON THE KEYBOARD BUSINESS ANALYSTS AT THE OFFICE OF IMPROVE THE OFFICE ORGANIZATIONAL IMPROVEMENT OFFICE IS ADJACENT TO MY TO MY GROUP. WHO FACILITATES THOSE PROCESS MAPPING SESSIONS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS AND SPECIFICATION REQUIREMENT DEVELOPMENT. AND THEN WE PARTNER WITH EVERY PRETTY MUCH EVERY OTHER PLACE IN DC ALSO LEGAL HR THOSE TYPES OF THINGS. I THINK YOU IF THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL IT WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL THANKS AGAIN FOR. JOINING US IN OFFERING YOUR PERSPECTIVE. OF THE SECOND PANEL IS GOING TO BE TECHNOLOGY UPDATE AND BOREDOM BUREAU EXPERIENCES. I THINK I. WE'LL GO AHEAD AND LET THAT THE PALACE JANICE AND THEN INTRODUCE YOURSELVES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING I'M ROBERT COOLEY I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS JUST AS THE FROM EXACTLY EXECUTIVE OFFICER MANY MEDICAL BOARD. JASON CHARLIE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER DCI. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ANDREW WORKING FROM THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY PROJECT APPROVALS IN OVERSIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED I HAVE. A BIT WITH MISS SPEARS WE HAVE ANSWERS. NOW I'M REPRESENTING YOUR MISTRESS OKAY. IF YOU WANNA GO AND GET STARTED IN THE- CURRENT TECHNOLOGY THANKS SURE. SENATOR MEMBERS. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO STATE CENTRAL IT ORGANIZATION IS BROAD RESPONSIBLE IN A FORTY OVER ALL ASPECTS OF TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT INCLUDING POLICY FORMATION INTERAGENCY COORDINATION IT PROJECT OVERSIGHT INFORMATION SECURITY. TECHNOLOGY SERVICE DELIVERY AND ADVOCACY. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CDT WHO ALSO SERVES AS THE STATE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER ADVICE IS THE GOVERNOR OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTION OF STATE IT RESOURCES. TTT WAS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING MAINTAINING AND OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STATE'S IT STRATEGIC PLAN. POLICIES STANDARDS PROCEDURES AND ENTERPRISE ARCHITECTURE. ADDITIONALLY DEPARTMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR APPROVING AND OVERSEEING IT PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFECYCLE WHICH MEANS THE PLANNING THE BUDGETING THE PROCUREMENT AND EXECUTION YOU FOR AND FROM PREVIOUS BOARD UP EXCEEDING THE PREVIOUS A PANEL. SOME DESCRIPTION OF THAT. THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION SECURITY GUNS TO SECURE THE STATE'S INFORMATION ASSETS. I HEARD THE PREVIOUS ABOARD AT THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS MADE BY THE PANELISTS AND IF I MIGHT COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD. AS I SAID. I REPRESENT THE OFFICES STATEWIDE PROJECT DELIVERY WHICH IS ONE OF THE SEVEN OFFICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY IN THIS OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PROJECT DELIVERY IS SPLIT INTO. TWO PRIMARY UNITS THE INDEPENDENT PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE OR PLANNING ACTIVITIES. AND THEN UPON THE COMPLETION OF THE PLANNING ACTIVITIES. THE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT. DURING THE PROJECT EXECUTION ACTIVITIES. THE END OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE YOU HEARD A SPLIT IN THE FOUR STAGES THE FIRST TWO BUSINESS ANALYSIS WHICH IS THE PROJECT CONCEPT AND- DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT OBJECTIVES YOU HAD A SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT OBJECTIVES THEY'RE BASED UPON THE CONCEPT OF SMART OBJECTIVES. MEANING THEIR SPECIFIC. MEASURABLE ACHIEVABLE REALISTIC AND TIME BOUND. AND ACTUALLY QUITE INSTRUMENTAL IN DETERMINING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM OUTCOMES AFTER THE TECHNOLOGIES DELIVERED. THE. HELP PROCESS WAS THE RESULT OF A TWENTY THIRTEEN BLUE RIBBON PANEL RECOMMENDATION SO IT WASN'T HERE WHEN THE A BREEZE ORIGINAL BREEZE PROJECT WAS LUNCHEON IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND IN FACT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AS IT IS TODAY WITH REGARD OVERSIGHT IS NOT THE SAME AS IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO AND CERTAINLY NOT WHEN THE BREEZE PARTY FIRST LAUNCHED. SO IN TWENTY THIRTEEN STAGE ONE BUSINESS ANALYSIS OF ROLLED OUT. AND THEN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN STAGE TO WHICH FOCUSES ON THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSIS. WAS ROLLED OUT BILL TURNS ANALYSIS TAKES A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL SOLUTION SPACE OF THE PROJECT TECHNOLOGY. AND ATTEMPTS TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVES THAT NEED TO BE EVALUATED BASED ON THE BUSINESS NEEDS OF THE PROGRAM AREAS. STAGE THREE AND FOUR WERE ROLLED OUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN STAGE THREE FOCUSES ON THE PROCUREMENT PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES INCIDENT THE PROCUREMENT TO MAKE SURE THE CONTRACTOR SET UP RIGHT. THE STATE WIDE TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT OFF THE STATE WHAT TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT WAS A NEW ADDITION JUST A FEW YEARS AGO TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE PROJECT DELIVERY WITHIN OVERSIGHT. AND CAME FROM D. G. S. AND ALLOW THE INFORMATION OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON IT SERVICES PROCUREMENT FOR THESE LARGE TYPE OF PROJECTS. SO THAT WAS IT AN ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT THAT DIDN'T EXIST IN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE D. G. S. HAD THIRTY FOUR IT PROCUREMENT. AND THEN STAGE FOR IS FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON FINAL ASSESSMENT AND APPROVAL AND READING THIS FOR THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS CASE THE BOARDS OF YOURS AND I THINK YOU HEARD FROM. MISTER JOHNNY THE FOCUS ON BUSINESS READING THIS FOR THE BREEZE PROJECT. SO THAT'S THE HEALTH PROCESS ONCE THE PROJECT RECEIVED FORMAL APPROVAL TO MOVE INTO ITS EXECUTION PHASE. THE FOCUS SHIFTS FROM THE FROM THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE TO THE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT. ELEMENT AND I AM ONE OF THE BRANCH CHIEFS FOR IN IN THIS CASE OVER THE DCA FOR THIS ACTIVITY FOR PROJECT OVERSIGHT. AND WE FOCUS ON HI IN MEETING CRITICALITY REPORTABLE PROJECTS OR NON DELEGATED PROJECTS. SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE THAT THE PROJECTS PERFORM ACCORDING TO THEIR ORIGINAL AND BASELINE PLANS FOR COST OF THE SCOPE AND QUALITY. THE INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT MANAGERS ARE GENERALLY FULL TIME WITHIN THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON IN REPORTING OUT MONTHLY TO THE STAKEHOLDERS PRIMARILY THE PROJECT SPONSOR. THE PROJECT DIRECTOR PROJECT MANAGER AND THAT INFORMATION IS TRANSPARENT AND PUBLISH MONTHLY ON OUR I. T. TRACKING WEBSITE SO WE CAN MONITOR THAT PROGRESS I KNOW IT'S OF INTEREST TO THE LA T'S OF INTEREST TO THE EAST STATE AUDITOR AND OF COURSE THE OTHER EXTERNAL CONSTITUENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE ENHANCE THE PROJECT OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK BY BRINGING IN. A FOCUS ON WHAT WE CALL INDEPENDENT VALIDATION VERIFICATION WHICH IS ANOTHER ELEMENT WITHIN OUR TOOLBOX THAT FOCUSES ON THE QUALITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY BUILD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE THAT THE- VENDOR IS BUILDING. THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY AND BUILDING IT WITH SUFFICIENT QUALITY THOSE KINDS OF PUTS A SURPLUS OF PROVIDE THE BUSINESS NEEDS OR MEET THE BUSINESS NEEDS OF THE OF THE AGENCY OR THE DEPARTMENT. I HAVE SOME OTHER COMMENTS PREPARED BUT THE MORE SPECIFIC IF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR THEM NOW OR I CAN WAIT UNTIL. YOUR QUESTIONS COME FORWARD. YEAH PERHAPS WE CAN CAN MEET OUR OTHER PANELISTS OFFER THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME WHERE. I GET MY NAME IS JUST AS THE FROM AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE OFFICEROF THE BATTERY MEDICAL BOARD HAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY. BOTH BOARDS WENT LIVE WITH BREEZE AND RELEASED TO. IN JANUARY TWENTY SIXTEEN. I ALSO SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF THE CHIEF PRIESTS CHANGE CONTROL BOARD WHICH PRIOR TO THIS ALL CHANGES TO THE PRE SYSTEM. I WAS THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF THEIR PRE SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION. AND PARTICIPATED. IN NEARLY ALL THE SYSTEM DESIGN DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS. THE BREEZES THE MODERNIZE OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES BY BRINGING THEM ON ALL ONLINE. THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY HAS ONLINE RENEWAL RATE OF 84% THIS WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF TARGETED OUTREACH AND DESIGN DECISIONS THAT EXPLAINS THE BENEFIT OF UTILIZING THE ONLINE APPLICATION PORTAL. AS OPPOSED TO A TIME CONSUMING PAPER PROCESS. THE BETTER MEDICAL BOARD HAS REACHED AN ONLINE RENEWAL RATE OF 59% WHICH I'M WORKING TO IMPROVE BY IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THE SAME OUTREACH STRATEGIES WE USE THAT COME A TREE TO ACHIEVE SUCH A HIGH UTILIZATION RATE. THE REASON FOR PUTTING WITH EASE TO USE ONLINE APPLICATION OPTION IS CLEAR WHEN YOU CONSIDER THIS FACT. 93% OF SE ONLINE SEE THE RENEWAL APPROVED IN LESS THAN A DAY. DURING MY TIME AT THE BOARD OF OPTOMETRY I SAW REAL BENEFIT FOR THE FOCUS ON ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE MANAGEMENT INTRODUCED DURING RELEASED TO. WE THOUGHT FOCUSED EFFORT ON BUSINESS PROCESS ANALYSIS IN ON TARGETED AND TIMELY. TRAINING THE BUSINESS IN CHECK STRATEGY HAS PERSISTED THREE OH TO OUR CONTINUING MAINTENANCE OF THE PRE SYSTEM. I DEVELOPED AN APPRECIATION FOR THE BUSINESS WERE BUSINESSES ROLE ON MODERNIZATION PROJECTS DURING MY TIME IN IMPLEMENTING BREEZE FOR THE PART ABOUT TOM TREE. MUCH LIKE THE BUSINESS MODERATION WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT TODAY I REALIZE THAT THE BUSINESS NEEDS SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY DRIVER NOT IT. I'VE BEEN AT THE VERY MEDICAL BOARD FOR A YEAR AND I BEGAN TO OVERLAY THESE IDEAS. FURTHER DEVELOPING STRONG TIES BETWEEN BOARD STAFF AND BREEZE RESOURCES BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY REINFORCING THE THOUGHT THAT WE MODERNIZE OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES AND THEN LAYER ON REQUIRED SUPPORT AND SYSTEMS. TO THIS END WE HAVE RECENTLY REDUCED OUR MULTI PATRON WILL SET NEW WILL NOTICE DOWN TO A SINGLE PAGE STRONGLY ENCOURAGING OUR LICENSEES TO UTILIZE OUR ONLINE SERVICES. TOUTING INSUFFICIENCIES. I MENTIONED EARLIER THE BETTER MEDICAL BOARD HAS AN ONLINE WE KNOW A GREAT A 59% THAT'S UP FROM 49% OVER LAST YEAR. WE ARE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW MODERN BUSINESS MODERNIZATION STRATEGY THE BOARD HAS RECENTLY BEGUN DISCUSSIONS WITH DC IRAN MODERNIZING OUR FIELD INSPECTION WORKS. ALL THE QUESTIONS FOCUS ON BUSINESS NEEDS AND NOT NECESSARILY TECHNOLOGY THIS METHOD MORE EASILY ENGAGES STAFF IN THE PROCESS THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EXPRESS THEIR NEEDS IN TERMS TO UNDERSTAND WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL CREATE A SUPERIOR PRODUCT. I AM INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR DISEASE QUIPPED PROHIBITING TO ENSURE LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR ONE WERE USED TO IMPROVE RELEASE TAIL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THINK TO PERSONALLY THANK THE ENTIRE BREEZE TEAM FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND DETERMINATION TO OUR BOARDS OUR STAFF AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS. WITHOUT THESE INDIVIDUALS BREEZE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AS SUCCESSFUL IT WAS FOR MY BOARDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AN OPPORTUNITY SPEAK WITH THE AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. QUICK TO FORGET TURN NEXT PANELIST I JUST HAVE A QUICK. CLARIFICATION QUESTION SO SOUNDS LIKE FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BY THE TIME WE GOT TO RELEASE TO BREEZE WAS ACTUALLY SMOOTH AND SUCCESSFUL. YEAH THE WRECK. OKAY SO THEN WHY DID WE- IF THAT'S THE CASE WE KIND OF SPEND ALL THIS TIME AND MONEY WORKING OUT ALL THE BUGS WITH RELEASE ONE. RELEASE TWO IS ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL WHY DID WE THEN ABANDON RELEASE THREE AND COME UP WITH A WHOLE NEW PLAN THAT'S LASTING AND OTHERS. EIGHT YEARS. THE SEVERING OF RELEASED THREE FROM THE PROJECT WAS. A DECISION MADE. AT DCA EXACT THE STATE LEADERSHIP LEVEL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. SO I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW HIGH KIDS HOW IT'S ANSWER THAT ONE. BUT AS FAR AS ABANDONING THE- PROJECT ITSELF IT WOULD IF WITH BEING SUCCESSFUL I THINK. THE TENETS OF THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. FOCUS ON BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE. TRAINING AND OUTREACH WORTHY HALLMARKS OF WHY RELEASED TO. WHAT'S SO SUCCESSFUL AND SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY IN A LITTLE BIT TECHNICALLY I APOLOGIZED THE CHALLENGES THAT OCCURRED IN RELEASE ONE I BELIEVE THE LA TALKED ABOUT PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND SO FORTH IN THE BREEZE ON THE BREEZE PLATFORM STILL REMAINED AT THAT TIME. AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT ADDING ON MORE BOARDS IN BUREAUS AT THIS POINT TO BREEZE IS DEFINITELY A POSSIBILITY BUT AT THE PROP PLATFORM HAS TO BE EXPANDED AND THAT. BREEZE IS ABSOLUTELY AN ALTERNATIVE IN EVERYONE OF THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION EFFORTS TO THE PLANNING STAGES AN ALTERNATE ANALYSIS INCLUDE BREEZE AS A MAN AS A MANDATED ALTERNATIVE IN ADDITION TO US THE CANNABIS PLATFORM THAT WE SPOKE ABOUT. AND THEN. OTHERS THAT MAY COME ABOUT FROM MARKET RESEARCH SO BREEZE IS ABSOLUTELY AN ALTERNATIVE THAT IS BEING LOOKED AT BY ALL OF THE BIZ MODERNIZATION GROUPS OKAY GOT IT AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DECISION TO EXPAND THE BREEZE PLATFORM IF THAT IS INDEED. NEEDED IS THAT YOU. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR EXPANDING IT YES BUT WE WOULD YEAH INFRASTRUCTURE LEE WE WOULD EXPAND IT TO. POTENTIALLY INCLUDE WHOEVER OF THE RELEASED THREE BOARDS NEEDED CHOSE TO GO ON IT WEATHER BUT THEIR- POWER PROCESS LED THEM TO THAT PLATFORM OKAY INTO MATT THAT MANAGEMENT OF. THE BREEZE PLATFORM ALSO FALLS WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW CORRECT. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU I'M GLAD AND WITH HUNTER NEXT PANELIST. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR CHAIRMAN WELL IN MEMBERS I'M ROBERT COOLEY OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE BOARD OF CHIROPRACTIC EXAMINERS ONE OF THE FOUR BOARDS. IN THE BUSINESS MONETIZATION COHORT ONE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE NEED FOR MODERNIZATION OF MY BOARD AS A PARENT AND EAGERLY ANTICIPATED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WANT TO INTERACT WITH US IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY DO THEIR BANGKOK OR ONLINE RETAILERS. FAST AND UNCOMPLICATED AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MENTION OF. AMAZON THIS MORNING AND I AM AN ADULT AMAZON PRIME MEMBER AND I THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS IN MY EARLY TALKS WITH CHASE AND WAS FEELING BECAUSE I'M NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY BUT I MY EARLY CONVERSATIONS WITH JASON. I KNEW WHAT WAS CAPABLE BECAUSE OF MY ONLINE TRANSACTIONS WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES AND SO I WAS EXPLAINING TO HIM WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO FROM PORT PERSPECTIVES AND UP. JUST A LITTLE SIDE NOTE THERE BUT. I'M FULLY CLOSED TODAY THANKS TO JEFF AS AS. I DON'T LIKE GOING TO MALLS. THE CURTAIN THE CURRENTLY OUR LICENSEES CANNOT CONDUCT BUSINESS WITH THE BOARD ONLINE NOR CAN THEY USE A CREDIT CARD TO PAY FEES. THIS IS BEEN A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR LICENSEES. THIS THEIR FRUSTRATION IS REGULARLY BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION I CAN'T ATTEND A CONFERENCE OR MEETING WHERE WITHOUT SOMEBODY SAYING HOW COME I CAN RENEW MY LICENSE IN WYOMING ONLINE BUT NOT CALIFORNIA. SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW I'M VERY EAGER TO IMPLEMENT. NEED TO NEEDLESS TO SAY THE BOARD AND I ARE CHAMPIONS OF THIS MODERNIZATION EFFORT BUT NOT WITHOUT INITIAL ANXIETY CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL FOR BUSINESS DISRUPTION. OUR CONCERNS WEREN'T AND REASONABLE THAT EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO THE EFFORT OUR ANXIETY HAS BEEN A SWATCH. I'VE COME TO LEARN THAT THE ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF IT'S A FULL BUSINESS MODERNIZATION EFFORT OUR ORGANIZATIONAL READING AS- THOROUGH AND SPECIFIC BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. AND MODULAR PRIORITIZE CHANGE OVER TIME THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUE IS ORGANIZATIONAL READING AS WHICH INCLUDES CONSIDERATION SUCH AS IS BOARD MANAGEMENT READY TO LOOKS EXPAND THE STAFF TIME AND FISCAL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IT'S STAFF READY AND ABLE TO BALANCE THE EXISTING AN ONGOING WORK FLOW DURING SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND DO WE KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT AND WHEN TO EXPECT IT. I CAN CONFIDENTLY ANSWER YES TO EACH OF THESE QUESTIONS THANKS TO DCA IS EARLY AND ONGOING SUPPORT. THE DEPARTMENT HAS GUIDED. MY BOARD AND ME THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND INSURED WE UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE IN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES REQUIRED BASED ON THIS COMMUNICATION. I KNOW MY BOARD KNOWS IN MY STAFF KNOWS THE LEVEL OF EFFORT REQUIRED AND THE LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION TO BE EXPECTED. TO DATE THE BOARD IS MAPPEDALL BUSINESS PROCESS SEES CONSIDERED PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AND THOROUGHLY DETAILED OUR BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE COMPLETED STAGE ONE AND TWO OF THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE THE MANDATORY PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND ARE CURRENTLY SUBMITTING STAGE THREE WHICH INCLUDES PROCUREMENT. OUR CURRENT TIME LINES TARGET THE PROJECT EARLY SO PROJECTS START DATE OF DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN AND INITIAL ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE THE BOARD IS READY TO MODERNIZE IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CONSTITUENTS. PRESIDENT MINUTE DON TECHNOLOGY NON TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY ADMINISTRATOR I WAS DAUNTED BY THE PROSPECT OF NAVIGATING THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS HOWEVER WITH CDT IN DC A LEADING THE WAY. THE PROCESS HAS BEEN PAINLESS AND INFORMATIVE AT TIMES IT'S BEEN EVEN ENJOYABLE THEIR EXPERTISE AND COMPETENCE ARE APPARENT I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO GUIDE MY BOARD THROUGH THE FINAL PHASES OF THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. DID IT SURPRISE YOU WHEN YOU STARTED TO GET THOSE TIMELINE TO SEE THAT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE A FIVE YEAR PROJECT. TO BE HONEST A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THEY SEVERED RELEASE THREE I HAD NO IDEA IF AND WHEN WE- WE WOULD BE BROUGHT INTO I WAS ASSUMING THAT EVENTUALLY WE WOULD BE YOU KNOW. THAT KIND OF FOOTBALL THAT IN THE BREEZE AND NOW I FIND OUT THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE OPTIONS WE MAY END UP USING PRES BUT WE YOU THROUGH THIS MODERNIZATION PROCESS WE DETERMINE WHAT WE NEED. AND SO THIS IS ACTUALLY MOVING ALONG QUICKER THAN I ANTICIPATED BECAUSE IT IS A THE DEPARTMENT ASKED ME HERE ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE STARTING THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION PROCESS. ARE DO YOU WANT TO JUMP IN EARLY AND I WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO AND IT'S GONE ALONG QUICKLY IN FACT. I AM MONITORING MY BUDGET CLOSELY BECAUSE WE RECENTLY REYES FEES AND THIS THIS CAME ABOUT SOONER THAN I EXPECTED SO MIGHT FUND HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO FULLY RECOVER AND- AND SO I AM. IT WOULD BE IT IT'S GOOD THAT WHERE THE PUT IT THAT WAY IN THE MONEY IN STAGES AND I YOU KNOW I MONITOR MY BUDGET DID JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STAY WITHIN BUT IT'S- IT THE THAT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT I WAS AND- THEN. NECESSARILY PLANNING ON GOING FORWARD THIS QUICKLY I'M HAPPY THAT I'M GOING FOUR FOR THIS QUICKLY BUT IT'S HERE SO IT IT SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME WHEN YOU'RE STANDING AT THE BEGINNING. BUT NOW WITH WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF IT AND ALSO WITH THE WITH THE NIMBLE MISS OF THE PROJECT IS JASON WAS STATING WE CAN ADD ON THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ADD ON SOME FUNCTIONALITY BEFORE WE'VE AND PROCURE THE NEW SYSTEM AND IT WILL TO WERE CONTRACTING THE VANITY CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS IN MY RENEWALS. AND SO THAT FUNCTIONALITY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER. EARLY NEXT YEAR. AND THEN WE CAN. APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE BUT BUT I A I TOLD THEM I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS I WANT I WANTED TO INCORPORATE CONTINUING EDUCATION AND HAVE EVEN NON LICENSEES LIKE OUR CONTINUING EDUCATION PROVIDERS AND SCHOOLS BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH US ONLINE TO TRANSFER RECORDS AND SO ON. I COULD SEE JASON'S EYES LIGHTING UP IN HE TOOK A PIECE OF PAPER AND HE WROTE THIS ROUGH TRADE DIAGRAM AND THERE WAS AN AREA IN THE MIDDLE AND HE WAS SHOWING ME HOW WE CAN DO THESE. THINGS HERE AND THEN WE HAVE THIS AND AGAIN I DON'T KNOW THE TERMS OF. IT HE SAID WELL YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS THIS AREA HERE IN THIS ALL BE HAPPENING HERE ANDTHEN WE CAN TRANSFER THAT INTO THE NEW. SYSTEM AND I UNDERSTOOD EIGHT I KNEW HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT I NEEDED AND I UNDERSTOOD WHAT. HE WAS TELLING ME WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO AND SO AND IT'S GOING ALONG AS EXPECTED SO I'M NOT DAUNTED BY THE TIME LINE IT'S WILL BE THERE. WILL BE THERE SOON ENOUGH. YOU MENTIONED ABOUT ABOUT DATE EXPECTED EXPENDITURE SO HOW MUCH HAVE YOU SPENT SO FAR ON PHASE ONE AND TWO. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING FOR PHASE THREE AND FOUR WHERE. WE'VE SPENT. ABOUT TWO MILLION WE'VE- WE'VE HAVE APPROPRIATED. AND I AM HOPING THAT WE STAY WITHIN THE FIVE MILLION RANGE I I'M CONFIDENT WE WILL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS FOR MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. WE CAN. WE CAN CHOOSE HOW. WE MOVEALONG SO WE DON'T HAVE TO ADD ALL THE FOLLOW THE FUNCTIONALITY AT ONCE AND SO.% THAT YOU KNOW THAT CAN HELP MITIGATE THAT AND- DELAYED CERTAIN COSTS BECAUSE WILL BE IT WILL BE. PROVIDING SERVICES AND. YOU KNOW LIKE WITH THE ONLINE RENEWAL INITIALLY WILL BE DOING THAT THROUGH A VENDOR WHO IS PROCESSING AND EVENTUALLY WILL BE ABLE TO PROBABLY. DO THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD NEED A VENDOR ACTUALLY TO CLARIFY THEIR THE ONE OF THE TO ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE SAID WHAT I SAID EARLIER WAS ON GOING ON THE ONLINE RENEWAL PORTAL THAT WE CREATED IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE GOING WITHIN THE NEXT THIRTY DAYS ON THAT THAT WAS A- INTERNAL RESOURCE. INTERIM FUNCTIONALITY DELIVERY. SO AND THAT'S- YOU'RE JUST THAT THESE INTERIM STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE AND THEN IT'LL EASE THE TRANSITION WHEN WE HAVE A NEW SYSTEM OF WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSITION THE THAT FUNCTIONALITY OVER TO THE NEW SYSTEM BUT- FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN EXPLAINED IT'S OUR LICENSEES. LIKELY WON'T SEE THE DIFFERENCE THIS WILL BE HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES AND WHEN THEY GO TO OUR WEBSITE EVERYTHING LOOKED THE SAME THE PROCESS WILL BE THE SAME. BAD WILL BE ABLE TO TRANSITION AT THAT TIME AND SO I LIKE THAT FACT THAT WE CAN YOU KNOW IT IS MORE CUSTOMIZABLE THERE IT'S- IT WE CAN WE CAN BE MORE NIMBLE AND- HI SO I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE PROCESS. AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THE EFFORT FOR SOME OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT YOU SERVE ON ON RENEWAL AND BEING ABLE TO USE CREDIT CARDS OR YOU TO THAT PRIORITIES AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET SOME RELATIVELY QUICK. WINS THERE WITH THIS IN TERMS LUCIEN ARE WE RULING OUT THAT. OF INCOME SOLUTION. ACROSS THE BOARD SO THAT. EVERYONE CAN CAN HAVE THAT EVEN IF IT IS JUST IN TRAM. YES ABSOLUTELY WE'VE IN GAUGE WITH ALL OF THE PROGRAMS AND THE I THINK I SAID SEVEN A SEVEN TOTAL PLUS TWO MORE OUT OF THE SEVENTEEN WILL BE ONLINE WITHIN THE NEXT TO TWO WEEKS I'M SORRY THIRTY DAYS OF THE REST OF IT WILL BE IN A FLOW BASIS OVER THE NEXT. I WOULD SAY THREE TO FOUR MONTHS THE WORD AGAIN WORKING WITH THEIR READINESS AND THEIR ABILITY TO ENGAGE WITH US TO COME UP WITH THE RIGHT THE- QUICKER REQUIREMENTS AND THAT SORT OF THING. OKAY GREAT BUT YOU'RE WORKING TO IGURE OUT YOU KNOW ARE THERE IN TRUMP DELIVERABLES THAT CAN. OUT ALL THE TIME THE LEVERAGE YOU HIGH THE PHONE NOW WRITER AUDIENCE OKAY. GREAT AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN CRITICAL BECAUSE AS YOU MENTIONED ONLINE RENEWAL IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR LICENSEES THEY THEY ALL WANT. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT ONLINE PAYMENTS BECAUSE IT'LL SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR MAIL ON MONDAY MORNINGS WE HAVE ONE PERSON THAT SPENDS THE MAJORITY OF THE MORNING OPENING THE MAIL AND IT'S MOSTLY RENEWALS. AND IF WE GET CUT THAT EVEN IN HALF NINE TO STATE IT'LL BE MORE THAN HALF WE WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY CUT WORKLOAD WE COULD DIRECT THOSE STAFF RESOURCES ELSEWHERE. I HAVE A SMALL PROGRAM TWENTY EMPLOYEES TOTAL SO THAT'S HUGE ONE WE'RE ABLE. TO REALIZE THOSE EFFICIENCIES THAT CUT THE MANUAL PROCESSING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO FOLLOWING UP ON AT AN EARLIER CONCEPT MENTIONED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE PARTICULARLY HEARING CALIFORNIA HOME OF SILICON VALLEY IS THAT TECH CHANGES SO RAPIDLY SO FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S KNOWLEDGE BASE ARE THERE MEASURES THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO STREAMLINED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECH. IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS OUR AGENCIES FIRST OF ALL AND SECOND. IF SO OR IF NOT ARE THERE STATUTORY OR STRUCTURAL BARRIERS THAT PREVENT A MORE RAPID IMPLEMENTATION THAT WE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AND BE KIND OF ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF CHANGING BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS A LEGISLATOR IS YOU KNOW WE WILL SEE ANOTHER NEW WAVE OF TACK ARRIVING AT OUR DOORSTEP ANYTIME NOW PARTICULARLY AROUND FINTECH FINANCIAL TECH WHICH IS GOING ALSO IMPLEMENT THEN IMMEDIATELY PAYMENTS AND PROCESSING SO MUCH OF WHAT YOU'RE AGENCIES DO. SO IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO IS THERE ANY WAY THAT WE CAN TO HELP YOU KIND OF CONSOLIDATE STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO TECH ENHANCEMENTS IN REAL TIME AND TO BE ABLE TO BETTER CONSERVE TO SERVE THE CONSUMERS THAT. APPRECIATE HEARING THAT. ALL ALL TEND TO ANSWER THAT I THINK THE ACT OF ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS. IS AN EXPANSION OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGIES STATEWIDE CONTRACTS LEVERAGED PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT EXIST THAT ALLOW DEPARTMENTS LIKE MINE LIKE. THE CA TO MORE EASILY PROCURE OF COMMODITIES UNDER THESE LEVERAGED PROCUREMENT I THINK THE EXPANSION OF THAT OR OR JUST THE MAINTENANCE OF THAT IN. THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE CUTTING EDGE MOST RELEVANT MOST IMPACTFUL TO A STATE GOVERNMENT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I KNOW THAT IF I CAN PURCHASE SOMETHING OFF OF. FROM ONE OF THOSE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGIES IT'S- A LOT QUICKER THAN IF I HAD TO GO AND A DIFFERENT WAY. SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MY MIND THE SECOND I WILL SAY THIS AT ALL IN AND MAKE IT WITH A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION. BUT TO TALK STE THE TIME LINES AS A WHOLE AND THE ABILITY TO BE AS AGILE AND NIMBLE AS POSSIBLE. WE STILL. BUT WORK WITHIN. STRUCTURES THAT EXIST THE LA SPOKE TO THE BUDGET CYCLE AND IT'S OF OVERLAY ON TECH PROJECTS AND THE APPROVAL OF TECH PROJECTS. SO WE HAVE THAT TO WORK WITH AND WE ALSO HAVE THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE WHICH- I AS SOMEBODY WHO IS ON THE RECEIVING END OF THE OVERSIGHT I'D RATHER SEE OVERSIGHT. YOU KNOW AS LEAN AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER THE REALITY IN IT SINCE THE PROJECT APPROVAL I CYCLE HAS COME ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH IT IT HAS PUT IT HAS THEY HAVE PARTNERED WITH US. TO MUCH MORE THOROUGH AND SUPERIOR AND PRODUCTS AND WHEN I SAY THAT NOT NECESSARILY JUST THE END PRODUCT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE PLANNING ARTIFACTS THE PROJECT ARTIFACTS. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE. MR WHARTON SPOKE ABOUT SCOPE COST SCHEDULE AND QUALITY AND THAT'S THE LAST ONE IS ONE THAT IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN SO THAT PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PUT EYES ON. PUT PUT MULTIPLE EYES ON THAT PROCESS AND I SEE THINK WE FIT WE'VE SEEN THAT SO. THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A SIDE STEP TO YOUR QUESTION BUT THE THINGS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A BIT OF A LINK TO YOUR PROBABLY IF YOUR TIME ARE. THOSE TO THOSE ITEMS BUT AGAIN NOT SAYING THAT IT'S A NEGATIVE THING BECAUSE I FOUND JUST A TON OF VALUE BEING ON THE OVERSIGHT END OF THAT PROCESS SINCE IT'S COME OUT AND THEY REFINED IT OVER. THE LAST FEW YEARS. TO ROUGH OUT SOME EDGES AND JUST BRING MORE RELEVANT INSIDE AND FEEDBACK TO THAT PROCESS. AND WE'RE. IN THE BUSINESS MODERNIZATION WERE VERY CLOSE PARTNERS WITH CDT. TO THE BENEFIT OF THE DEPARTMENT CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEFINITELY. IF I A MAJOR SAID I MY UNDERSTANDING IS OUR NEW SYSTEM WILL BE ADAPTABLE AND THE NEW TECHNOLOGY COULD ESSENTIALLY PLUG AND TO SO WE CAN ADVANCE WITH THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT'LL BE THE CAPABILITY GOING FORWARD SO THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE OBSOLETE. BY THE TIME WE YEAH WE PROCURING AND GET IT IMPLEMENTED IT'S GOING TO BE ON TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN. EXPAND YES THANK YOU AND THAT WAS THE SECOND PART QUESTION I APOLOGIZE I THINK IN CHOOSING. TECHNOLOGY THROUGH THIS PROCESS IN ORDER TO FUTURE PROOF WHICH IS KIND OF YOUR QUESTION HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T SPEND A DOLLAR TODAY AND ITS ITS VALUE LIST TOMORROW WE DO THAT WE ATTEMPT TO DO THAT BASED ON THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS TODAY. HOW MUCH OF IT IS ADAPTABLE HOW QUICK TO MARKET OUR CHANGES HUGELY IMPORTANT AND I THINK WAIT A PART IN IT IN A TECHNOLOGICAL ARC THAT ALLOWS US WITH PLENTY OF TECHNOLOGIES PLATFORMS THAT EXISTS TODAY A LOT OF HAS A SERVICE WE MAY BE COULD BE MAY HAVE HEARD OF SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE PLATFORM AS A SERVICE. CLOUD CLOUD APPLICATIONS THAT WERE AT WERE IN AN ARC IN TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY THAT WE BELIEVE ARE CONFIDENT MAY ALLOW US TO CHOOSE A TECHNOLOGY THAT WILL MAKE US AS FUTURE PROOF AS IS REASONABLE SO THAT WE CAN. WE CAN VALUE THE IT INVESTMENT FOR YEARS BUT ALSO WHEN IT'S TIME TO CHANGE IT WAS TIME TO ADAPT WERE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH AS LITTLE DISRUPTION AS POSSIBLE. THE ECO SYSTEM IDEA THAT I BROUGHT UP EARLIER. WHAT HE JUST EXPLAINS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN EARLIER IN MY PRESENTATION IS JUST THAT THAT ADAPTABILITY AND PLUGGING IN THESE SERVICES AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO THAT. AT ON THE FRONT END BUT BUT WILL HAVE THAT CAPABILITY TO ADAPT AND TO ADD ON GOING FORWARD SO TO ME THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING I'M EXCITED ABOUT. CORRECT ME FOR MODEST BUT BREEZE HAS THE CAPABILITY RIGHT NOW TO BE ADAPTABLE SO WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT. OUR INSPECTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE PAPERWORK TAKE UP OUR INSPECTORS TO DO WE ACTUALLY HAD DECENT SEEN COME OUT AND DO A RIGHT ON INSPECTIONS AND WATCH THE PROCESS AND THEN WE CAN DISCUSS. THE BEST WAYS TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS BY BUILDING ON TO BREEZE ARE POTENTIALLY GET OTHER SOFTWARE THAT WORKS WITH BREEZE. SO I DON'T THINK THAT BREEZE ITSELF IS OBSOLETE BECAUSE IT IS A DOCTOR PULLED CORRECT. SHE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK THE IDEA OF THIS ECO SYSTEM THAT I KEEP SPEAKING ABOUT. PLUGS BREEZE AND THE CANNABIS PLATFORM INTO THAT. ENVIRONMENT FOR FOLKS TO USE TO USE AND TO ADD ON TO BOLT ON TWO DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITIES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE WE FOUND GENERALLY THE TECHNOLOGIST ACROSS MY CAREER. IS THAT NGUYEN AND IT WOULDN'T AGENCY A COMPANY INVEST A LOT IN A PLATFORM OF SOME SORT. THEY ATTEMPT TO SHOVE EVERY POTENTIAL BUSINESS OP BUSINESS PROCESS INTO THAT SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY- SPENT A INVESTED IN IT. AND SOMETIMES A REALITY IS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ARE THE- ANSWER TO. A PROVIDING A HOLISTIC OPERATIONAL DOES IT OPERATED OPERATIONAL IS ATION OF YOUR PROCESSES. SO BREEZE FITS RIGHT INTO THE ECOSYSTEM TALKS TO. X. Y. AND Z. TO ACHIEVE AN OVERALL OPERATION FOR THE BOARD OF. INSERT BOARD HERE. PHARMACY VET MED CHIROPRACTORS ETCETERA. SHOULD BROUGHT THAT ROUGH DRAFT THAT YOU DID FOR ME BECAUSE IT HE EXPLAINED IT SO WELL AND THAT YOU JUST AS LITTLE DRAWING OUT OF PAPER AND IT WAS EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE AND I GET FOR ME WHO KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. I KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT AND WHAT WE COULD DO AND SO IT MADE ME EXCITED ABOUT THE PROCESS. IT'S GOOD YEAH IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE EFFECTIVE. PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE TACKLING SOME OF THESE REALLY HARD. BAKE AT ISSUES SUCH AND THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR IN FROM STARTED REPORT ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE BEEN REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THIS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT AND CD T. AND THE BUREAU OF AUDITS AND OUR AGENCY BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING I MEAN EVERYBODY IS ENGAGING AND- PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCESS SO WE ALL NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WHEN AND THERE WON'T BE ANY SURPRISES FOR ANYBODY IT'S REALLY A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE HOW IT'S WORKING OUT. JUST CHECKING BACK ONE MORE TIME THAT THIS QUESTION A TIME LINE AB THIS LITTLE. THIS GUY. ARE THERE THINGS WE COULD DO SO THIS HAS SAID HAVE FLOW CHART OF WHEN THINGS ARE GONNA GET ROLLED OUT WITH PHARMACY BEING DELIVERED IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ARE THERE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO COME PROCESS AND OTHER THINGS WE CAN HELP YOU TO TAKE A PROCESS. I'M I THINK THE ANSWER IS YES AND I THINK YOU YOU WERE GOING TO SEE OUR COMPRESSION OF THOSE TIME LINES I SPOKE A LITTLE EARLIER ABOUT THE- PLANNING SLASH ACADEMIC NATURE OF THOSE TIME LINES WE HAD TO WE HAD TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE VERY BEGINNING. FOR DURATIONS AND THE LIKE AND- THEN WE HAD. CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAD A STAFF CONSTRAINTS THAT WE HAD TO CREATE THIS SEVENTEEN PROGRAM LANDSCAPE. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS WE'VE GOTTEN INTO IT WITH EACH BOARDING BUREAU AS MISTER POULIOT SUGGESTED THEY WERE EXCITED TO DO IT THEY WERE EXCITED TO BE ENGAGED AND THEIR ACTIVITIES. XCELERATED IN AND ACHIEVED EARLIER SUCCESSES THAN THE STATED. DATES I WANT TO SPEAK TO PHARMACY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE THAT'S THAT. GUY THAT THE DIED AT THE TAIL END OF THAT SQUIGGLE PHARMACY I'VE ENGAGED I BELIEVE I SPOKE TO THIS BUT I'VE ENGAGED WELL A LOT WITH THE LEADERSHIP. AT THE FOUR BOARD OF PHARMACY NOW AND THEY ARE AND- THEY ARE. DEFINITELY LOOKING TO ACCELERATE AND COMPRESS THAT TIME FRAME LIKE I SAID THE INITIAL FUNCTIONALITY AT THE BOARD OF PHARMACY IS IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TIME FRAME BUT- I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THAT COMPRESS EVEN MORE. IN THAT WE- ARE READY ORGANIZATION. AN ORGANIZATION THAT IS READY FOR A CHANGE IS ONE THAT IS SUCCESSFUL IT'S- A PARTICIPATORY AN ACTIVE AND ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS TO DATE ARE. BECOMING THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT LAST DOT IN THE SQUIGGLE IS GOING TO ACCELERATE JUST BASED ON THE- WORD OF MOUTH P. R. THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODERNIZATION. PROGRAMS OTHER PROGRAMS ARE HEARING OF THE- EAR BUSINESS VALUE THAT THEY'RE ACHIEVING FORGET I. T. FORGET ANYTHING CHEATING CARE BUSINESS VALUE OF LOOKING AT THEIR PROCESSES THAT THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IN A WHILE TO IMPROVE THOSE. JUST THIS TRIANGLES AND SQUARES ON A PIECE OF PAPER HOW DO I PUT HOW DO I. PUSH THIS PAPER THROUGH OUR PROCESS DO I REALLY HAVE TO HAVE IT HAD TEN STOP MAYBE I COULD HAVE IT HAVE EIGHT STOCKS ARE SIX STOPS INSTEAD. AND THEY'RE REALLY RUDE THERE WERE REALIZING A LOT OF PURE BUSINESS VALUE. THAT. WORD OF MOUTH IS GENERATING. ACTIVE PART TIONS ORDER PHARMACY I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT THAT'S GOING TO COMPRESS WITH DISCUSSIONS IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WE REPORT AGAIN. THOSE DATES IN ANNUALLY IN OUR UP IN OUR ANNUAL UPDATE SO YOU'LL BE RECEIVING A REPORT IN AT THE END OF DECEMBER. THAT. I'M HOPING SHOWS THAT SOME SHOWS COMPRESSED TIME LINES IN THAT AREA ESPECIALLY THE LATEST ONE. GREAT THANK YOU. GO AHEAD OF SEX JUST I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT BECAUSE THIS FOR THE RELEASE ONE BOARDS THERE THE FIRST COHORT TO AND IT SAYS THAT. IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SIX ONE BUT AS I WAS SAYING EARLIER IT WILL HAVE ONLINE RENEWAL CAPABILITY BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME OF THAT CAPABILITY WELL BEFORE YOU TO WE- ROLL THIS OUT A COMPLETE PROJECT. AND I BELIEVE ACUPUNCTURE IS LOOKING INTO ADDING SOME C. E. TRACKING FUNCTIONALITY AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION SO WE ARE GAINING BENEFIT JUST THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU. GO HADN'T AND OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW WORDS RIGHT GREAT WELL THEN WITHOUT I THINK WE'LL GO AHEAD AND DIET AND WRAP UP THE HEARING WHEN IT THANK OUR PANELISTS AGAIN FOR JOINING US I AM VERY ENCOURAGED I THINK ABOUT A COUPLE THINGS HERE FIRST YEAR THAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER IN TRADE WINDS AN INTERN FUNCTIONALITY I THINK THAT'S THAT'S BAG. SECOND THAT WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS I IN IN TERMS OF SOMETHING THAT CAN EVOLVE OVER TIME AND THAT THAT WILL AYE BE ADAPTABLE AS FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES AYE AYES FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES EVOLVE BUT IT'S ALSO GREAT TO HEAR YOU TOUT THE COLLABORATION ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS. SO THAT'S ALL GOOD NEWS I THINK. YOU I STILL. WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS IS AS WE SHARED I THINK THAT. ARE THE LACK OF A CLEAR BUDGET GIVES ALL OF US PAUSE AND- AND- AS THE PROJECTED TIMELINE I THINK DOES CONTINUE TO GIVE ALL OF US SOME PAUSE SO. I THINK MY REQUESTS I'LL JUST REITERATE WOULD BE IF WE CAN CAN TAKE A LOOK AND IF THERE'S- A WAY TO PUT TOGETHER EVEN IF IT'S A HIGH LEVEL. BUDGET SAID THAT. THE LEGISLATURE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT ACTUALLY WE'RE LOOKING HOW WE THINK ABOUT. THIS IS MODERNIZATION ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT AND SECOND IF YOU CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. WAYS TO CONTINUE DELIVERED SOME OF THESE INTERIM FUNCTIONAL WINS THAT WOULD BE TRAFFIC. BUT THAT THANK YOU AGAIN AND WE ARE ADJOURNED
