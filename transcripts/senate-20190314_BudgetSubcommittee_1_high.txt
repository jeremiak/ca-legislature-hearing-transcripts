I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL BE JOINING US AS SOON AS THEY CONCLUDE THEIR MEETING SO WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED THIS IS A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE EDUCATION GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CROWD OR NOT. I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE IN THE RIGHT SPOT. WE'RE GOING TO COVER THREE ISSUES TODAY. THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA IN THE STATE WIDE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS SO. WITH THAT THIS IS -- AGAIN AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITH THAT WHY DON'T WE GET STARTED WITH -- ISSUE NUMBER ONE IT'S ITEM SIXTY ONE HUNDRED DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND OUR FIRST PANEL. IF YOU'LL JOIN US PLEASE THE COMMISSION. GERMAN IF YOU WILL INTRODUCE YOURSELVESFOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT YOU'RE RIGHT SIR. WARNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS ERIN AT AREA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US MR FREDDIE. AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR KENNETH COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU MISTER CAPONE. YOU MAY PROCEED. MORNING I REALIZED I HAVE A HANDOUT THAT I PASSED OUT LAST WEEK THAT I WAS GOING TO REFERENCE AGAIN TODAY BUT I DID NOT BRING ANY MORE WITH ME. SO I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT AND IF NECESSARY WE CAN GET THAT OVER TO YOUR STAFF -- AFTERWARD TODAY -- BUT WITH THAT -- GET TO MY MY COMMENTS SO TODAY I'M GOING TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALCULATION OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND SOME OF THE THE CALCULATIONS THAT GO I'VE GOT THE LEVELS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE BUDGET WINDOW -- THAT WE HAVE UNDER THE PROPOSED GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE BUDGET PROPOSES THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF FUNDING EVER UNDER THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEED. AT EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS UP FROM SEVENTY SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND FORTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS DURING THE TROUGH OF THE RECESSION. WITH CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH DURING THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE GREAT RECESSION TOTAL GENERAL FUND REVENUES AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. FORTIN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AN INCREASE OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN REVENUE LEVELS. AT A TOTAL OF EIGHTY POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S A PER PUPIL EXPENDITURE FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT OF JUST OVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PUPIL AN INCREASE OF ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE OVER. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. AS NOTED -- IN OFFICE USE. THE FUNDING LEVELS -- COMPARED TO THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT. LEVELS BY ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER THAN GROWTH COMPARED TO THE BUDGET ACT AND A YEAR OVER YEAR DECLINE IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE GROWTH AS WE WENT FROM. 201-718-21819 OUT TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE SECOND [inaudible] BECAUSE WHILE. THAT MAY SEEM A LITTLE BIT COUNTER INTUITVE ESSENTIALLY WELL GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE INCREASE ACROSS THE PERIOD COMPARED TO BUDGET ACT THE YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE INCREASE OF TWO POINT NINE BILLION AS HE WENT. TO SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN VERSES A TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLAR REVENUE INCREASES WE GO FROM. SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ACTUALLY HAS THE EFFECT ESSENTIALLY OF LIMITING THE GROWTH SOMEWHAT IN THE GUARANTEE AS OPPOSED TO HAVE REVENUES HAD GROWN BY LET'S SAY TWO POINT NINE OR MORE IN IN BOTH YEARS AND YOU HAD THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GROWTH -- EQUALING OR OR ECLIPSING THE GROWTH THAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EXPERIENCE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT ANY GROWTH IN REVENUES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND BEYOND APPROXIMATELY. TWENTY TWO HUNDRED EXCUSE ME GROWTH BEYOND APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WOULD NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS ESSENTIALLY WOULD SWITCH US TO ATTEST TO YEAR WHERE THE INFLATION ADJUSTMENT. THEN BECOMES A PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME ADJUSTMENT AND NOT A FUNCTION OF REVENUES. RAINY DECREASING REVENUES IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WHAT'S THE PROB NINETY A ALSO LOSE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY FURTHER EVER REVENUE INCREASES BY OUR ESTIMATES OR DECREASES -- AT THE MAY REVISION WOULD IMPACT THE GUARANTEE BY ABOUT FORTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AS WE ARE LOOKING TO PRETTY SOLIDLY BE IN A TEST ONE YEAR. BECAUSE THERE IS. NO LONGER ANY OUTSTANDING MEAT INSPECTOR BALANCE PROP NINETY EIGHT WILL LIKELY NOT BE A SENSITIVE TO INCREASES OR DECREASES OR IN THIS CASE PARTICULARLY INCREASES IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES. AS WE HAVE IN RECENT YEARS OBSERVED AT THE MAY REVISION -- AND NOW THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUDGET LIKELY THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY SIDE WILL STAND TO GAIN PROPORTIONATELY MORE FROM REVENUE INCREASES THAN IN YEARS PAST BECAUSE OF THAT MAINTENANCE FACTOR. BEING FULLY PAID OFF NOW. COM ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET MAKES THE FINAL PAYMENT TOWARDS OUTSTANDING SETTLE UP IN THIS YEAR OTHER WAS STILL EXISTING SO BALANCES -- TO PRIOR YEARS UNDER THE GUARANTEE -- THAT FINAL PAYMENT IS APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS -- K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION FORTUNATELY WILL NOT EXPERIENCE A REDUCTION IN PRIOR KERN YOUR APPROPRIATIONS SENSUALLY CASH FLOW TO SCHOOLS -- DESPITE THOSE DECLINES IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IN THE PRIOR AND CURRENT YEAR THAT I MENTIONED THAT'S BECAUSE OF TWO SEPARATE MECHANISMS THAT WE'RE USING WHERE ONE WHERE -- PROPOSING TO OVER PROBE GUARANTEE BY ABOUT FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THE WE DON'T HAVE TO REDUCE IT AND IN THE SECOND PIECE OF THAT AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OR PROS IN THE USE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OF SETTLE UP. TO PAY FOR A PORTION OF LC FIVE FUNDING IN. EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WITH ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND MOVING PARTS ARE JUST LAID OUT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS STILL LEFT WITH ABOUT TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO SPEND WITH OUR PROPOSAL AND MUSCLES PROPOSALS AYE AYE COVERED -- IN OUR HEARING LAST WEEK SO I WON'T GET INTO TO ME AT THE CIVICS BUT OF COURSE HAPPY -- TO TO TALK LATER ABOUT THOSE TWO IF YOU WOULD LIKE OF THE BOOK OF THAT OF COURSE AS I MENTIONED LAST WEEK IS TWO BILLION DOLLARS GOING TOWARDS THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF THREE POINT 4%. THE CFF AND ALSO ABOUT A FIVE HUNDRED SIX SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL A MADE UP OF BOTH ONE TIME AND ONGOING MONEY FOR SOME SPECIAL ED -- FUNDING AND THEN ALSO A THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SOME VERY VERY SUGGEST MEN'S -- WITHIN THEIR WORLD. LASTLY I DO WANT TO MENTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL REGARDING THE PROP NINETY EIGHT CERTIFICATION PROCESS -- SPECIFICALLY THIS BUDGET PROPOSES REPEALING THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT TRIP MECHANISM THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE AB -- EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE AND THEN ALSO UP WE PROPOSED TO ELIMINATE THE STATE'S ABILITY TO MAKE DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS THE GUARANTEES FUNDED LEVEL IN THE PRIOR YEAR -- OR INTENT WITH THIS IS HOPEFULLY TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAINTY FOR SCHOOLS WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR LEVELS OF FUNDING IN THE PRIOR YEARS -- AND THEN ALSO GIVING -- THE MINISTRATION LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY BEING IN THE GUARANTEE A WITHOUT I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BUT HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. WELL WITH RESPECT TO THE CHANGE IN THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS HOW HOW IS THAT GOING TO IMPACT OUR BUDGETING. I REALIZE IT'S GOOD FOR THE LA X.. AND THE AND THE AND FRANKLY IN HIGHER EDUCATION IS YOU MAY. RECALL FROM LAST WEEK -- YOU KNOW THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE CERTAINTY AND THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE SAME THING WHETHER IT'S IN THE FORM OF RESERVE ACCOUNT OR SOME OTHER BALANCING -- BALANCING TOOL BUT FROM A BUDGETING STANDPOINT HOW HOW DOES THIS REALLY WORK. SURE SO -- FIRST WE CAN TALK ABOUT KIND OF RETROSPECTIVELY SO FOR LOOKING AT PRIOR YEARS AND NOT HAVING THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE ANYMORE -- ESSENTIALLY WHAT LITTLE FUNCTION HOW IT HAD FOR YEARS WHERE IN A PRIOR YEAR WHERE -- THERE WERE ANOTHER WEEK'S EXPERIENCE A DROP IN THE FOR EXAMPLE IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAD OVER A PRODUCTION -- THAT WE ARE NOW PROPOSING TO OVER APPROPRIATE BY FORTY FOUR MILLION. ESSENTIALLY LOOKING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE FUTURE YEARS IF WE HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF SITUATION WE WOULD JUST HAVE THE DECISION TO MAKE DO WE MAKE THAT -- REDUCE THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND SOMEHOW CLAWED BACK THAT MONEY POTENTIALLY WHICH HISTORICALLY IT HAS BEEN VERY UNCOMMON OR DO WE JUST OVER APPROPRIATE TO GUARANTEE AND SENSUALLY GIVE THAT CERTAINTY TO SCHOOLS THAT THEY KNOW OKAY I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE BACK ON THAT ON THAT. CASH THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT'S ALREADY GONE OUT -- NOT A LOT CHANGES THERE IT JUST DOESN'T GIVE THE STATE THE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE -- TO COUNT THAT OVER PREPARATION IN THIS CASE -- WITHIN THE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE TO THEN BE ABLE TO USE TOWARDS A OF A POTENTIAL FUTURE SETTLE UP DEBT -- AND AS WE LOOK PRO SUBJECTIVELY -- IT DOESN'T CHANGE -- A WHOLE LOT ON ON THAT END BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY -- WE ALREADY. WOULDN'T BE FROM. CALCULATING SETTLE UP FOR YOU KNOW A BUDGET OR CURRENT YEAR WE'D WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE IT THAT'S WITH THOUGHT THOSE ARE ALL. RETROSPECTIVE CALCULATION SO AS WE LOOK -- FORWARD PROSPECTIVELY -- THE PROPOSAL THAT I JUST. MENTIONED DOESN'T REALLY IMPACT OUR OUR PROSPECT OF BUDGETING -- THAT MUCH IT WE WE STILL WOULD HAVE MOST OF THE SAME OPTIONS THAT WE HAD UNDER -- THE THE PROPOSAL -- AND OF COURSE HISTORICALLY GOING BACK AS WELL. YOU KNOW I'M NEW TO THIS PROP NINETY EIGHT DANCE BUT JUST TO CUT THROUGH THAT. WILL THERE EVER BE A TRUE UP IN -- THERE. I 5% WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT CORRECTLY ARE THERE STILL WILL BE A A TRUE UP SO WE'RE NOT GETTING RID OF THE MORE SUBTLE UP YOU CALL IT YES YES KNOW PRECISELY SO THERE THERE WILL STILL BE -- A MECHANISM WHEREBY WE WILL ESTABLISH HOW MUCH SETTLE UP IS IS GOING TO BE IS A CRUDE TO A CERTAIN YEAR AND THEN OFFICE SCHEDULED TO BE PAID OUT SO THAT'S NOT CHANGING -- THAT THAT THAT WILL STILL EXIST -- THE IT'S KIND OF THE MORE COST ALLOCATION SCHEDULE I MENTIONED THAT WILL NOT EXIST AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NEW -- WITH THE WITH WHAT WAS PASSED AT THE BUDGET ACT LAST YEAR. COLLEAGUES IN QUESTIONS. EARLIER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I FIND PROPOSITION NINETY TO BE IT COMPLETELY CONFUSING. SO I'M TRYING TO GET MYSELF UP TO SPEED I HAD A QUESTION IT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT I APOLOGIZE IF YOU ALREADY COVERED THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE BIT LATE. WHY WAS PROP ONE ELEVEN AT IT WHY WAS THERE A THIRD TEST ADDED? RIGHT SO IF I CROSS RECALL CORRECTLY -- PROP -- ONE ELEVEN WAS LARGELY A RESULT OF I FORGET EXACTLY WHICH I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN -- NINETEEN NINETY THAT THERE WAS A THERE WAS A RECESSION -- AND THAT AFFECT THE WHAT HAPPENED WHERE YOU HAD A PROP -- EXCUSE ME TEST ONE WHICH IS MEANT TO BE OF WHERE -- PROP NINETY EIGHT SHARES A OF GENERAL FUND FISCALLY ABOUT 40%. AND THEN TEST TO WHERE IT'S A FUNCTION OF PER CAPITA PERSONAL INCOME. AND THOSE WERE THE THE ONLY TWO POSSIBLE TAX BUT IT CAME TO BE THAT IN A RECESSION SCENARIO -- THE GUARANTEE WAS ESSENTIALLY OUTPACING ACTUAL GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY IN THIS CASE A DECREASE IN THE ECONOMY BUT WE HAD NO WAY. TO WITHOUT SPENDING THE GUARANTEE -- KIND OF ACCOUNT FOR THAT WITH THE ECONOMY WAS DOING -- AND KIND OF TREAT PROP NINETY EIGHT PROPORTIONALLY TEST THREE WAS ADDED AND TO BE ABLE -- TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT PER CAPITA GENERAL FUND REVENUES AND THEN -- WITH THAT NOW BE ABLE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THERE ARE YEARS WHERE -- THE ECONOMY IS IS -- DOING WELL BUT MAYBE GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE DOING AS WELL SO THAT THE STATE'S NOT DOING AS WELL A WEARABLE TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING GUARANTEE AND HAVE IT GROW OUT OF PROPORTION THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE. SUSTAINABLE GIVING WHAT'S HAPPENING -- WITH WITH THE GUARANTEE THIS WAS A WAY TO REDUCE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AND RECESSION. IT WAS IT WAS A WAY TO MAKE IT ABLE TO GROW MORE -- PROPORTIONALLY WITH THE ECONOMY LIKE I SAID. LIKE TO LET THE LA ALSO. THANK YOU BACKGROUND. YES THANK YOU AT SOME DALY THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CAN UPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AFFECTED LEE CREATED A FIRE WALL AROUND SCHOOL FUNDING-- BUT AS YOU KNOW SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY STATE BUDGET AND WE ENTERED A RECESSION IT TURNED OUT TO BE PRETTY DIFFICULT FOR THE STATE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO SCHOOL FUNDING. OPPOSITION WHEN ELEVEN THAT CREATED SOME NEW FORMULAS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED BUT THERE THE REAL THRUST OF THE MEASURE WAS LEADING THE STATE PROVIDE SCHOOLS A LITTLE BIT LESS DURING TIGHT FISCAL TIMES. IN EXCHANGE FOR GROWING SCHOOL FUNDING BY QUICKLY WHEN THE ECONOMY RECOVERED. GREAT THANK YOU [inaudible] SEVERAL QUESTIONS. LA -- DID YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE BERMAN OF FINANCE PRESENTATION. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'LL I'LL JUST KEEP MY REMARKS -- TO A LIMIT OF BACKGROUND AND IN SOME COMMENT -- I'LL BE SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT -- I I SHARED EARLIER. I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE A PRETTY GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE BIG MOVING PIECES AND THIS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I THINK THEIR PRESENTATION WAS A TIMELY REMINDER THAT YOU'VE GOT NEARLY A DOZEN INPUTS THAT AFFECT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT I GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND CHANGES IN THE STATE ECONOMY. AND EVERY YEAR THOSE FACTORS TAKE ON KIND OF VARYING LEVELS OF IMPORTANT SOMETIMES GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUE IS MORE IMPORTANT SOMETIMES THE CHANGES IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND MORE IMPORTANT. A FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TURNING TO PAGE. ONE THE ADMINISTRATION SAY IS THAT. IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT THE STATE THAT SCHOOL FUNDING EQUAL TO TO ITS ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE AT THAT TIME. SINCE THEN WE'VE REVISED OUR ESTIMATES OF THE NOW SCHOOL FUNDING IS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ABOVE THE GUARANTEE. SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO DO IS TO LET SCHOOLS RETAIN ALL OF THAT MONEY I DON'T TO CUTS DOWN TO DEFERRALS. ABOUT ON PAPER WE CLASSIFY IT AS BEING A PAYMENT TOWARD SOME PRIOR YEAR IS. AND THAT'S A KIND OF SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE IT ONE AT LET'S TO AVOID NY KIND OF IMMEDIATE YOUR TRUMP DISRUPTION ON SCHOOL BUDGETS. BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS THE STATE TO BUILD ON NEXT YEAR'S MINIMUM GUARANTEE ON THAT LOWER FACE WHAT THE GUARANTEE ACTUALLY WAS NOT THE HIGHER LEVEL OF FUNDING SCHOOLS ACTUALLY RECEIVED. AND SO IT'S KIND OF A SIGNIFICANT DECISION FOR YOUR OUT YOUR BUDGET CALCULATIONS. TURNING TO PAGE TWO AS THE ADMINISTRATION TOLD YOU THE GUARANTEE IS GOING THREE POINT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND YOU PROBABLY RECOGNIZE THAT. AS BEING A BIT LOWER THAN IN SOME PREVIOUS YEAR IS -- A LOT OF THAT A PREVIOUS GROWTH WAS FUELED BY THIS CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT WE CALL MAINTENANCE FACTOR THIS WAS SOMETHING ADDED BY PROPOSITION -- ONE ELEVEN IT'S AND IT'S THAT MECHANISM FOR LETTING THE STATE AND PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT LESS FOR SCHOOLS DURING TAKE TIME IS AN EXCHANGE FOR GROWING FUNDING WILL QUICKLY DURING GOOD TIMES -- THE STATE HAS NO OF PAID OFF ALL OF THAT MAINTENANCE FACTOR AND SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE. RESULTING IN SCHOOL FUNDING GOING AS QUICKLY AS IT HAS A SAY OVER THE PAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS -- I THINK THIS YEAR'S BUDGET PROBABLY GIVES YOU A GOOD FLAVOR OF WHAT THAT GROWTH WILL LOOK LIKE. ASK FOR SOMETHING MORE IN THE RANGE OF 324% PER YEAR RATHER THAN FACE 6527% OF THE PAST COUPLE YEARS -- THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T TALK ABOUT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE BUT IN THE PAST THAT SOME TIME HAS BEEN AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENT ESTIMATES -- BUT THIS YEAR ARE ESTIMATES OF LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE I VERY VERY CLOSE. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NEW OFTEN REDUCES -- HOW MUCH THE STATE HAS TO PROVIDE FOR THE GENERAL FUND TO MEET THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND STAR ESTIMATES THIS YEAR ACROSS THE THREE YEAR PERIOD A VERY CLOSE? ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DIFFERENT -- PAGE THREE IS A SHOWING YOU. WHAT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE HAS MEANT FOR PER PUPIL FUNDING SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT SO. THIS IN NINETEEN TWENTY UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDING PER STUDENT WOULD BE TWELVE THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN DOLLARS. THAT IS AN ALL TIME HIGH EVEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION -- BUT MIGHT NOT BE AS MUCH OF A SURPRISE GIVEN THE LONG ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT WE'RE IN WE'RE JUST THREE MONTHS NOW SHY OF THE LONGEST ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN US HISTORY. AND THAT A STRONG GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY STRONG GROWTH IN REVENUE HAS PUSH THESE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FORMULAS AND PULLED THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UP UPWARD ALONG THAT SAME TRAJECTORY. LOOKING UP BEYOND THE BUDGET YEAR I MENTIONED ON THE TRAIN TO PAGE FOUR I THINK I MENTIONED SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE READY BUT WE DID A FOR ABOUT. FOUR YEAR LOOK AHEAD AT THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE UNDER TWO DIFFERENT ECONOMIC SCENARIOS WE KNOW. THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS VOLATILE IT CHANGES A LOT AND WE WANTED TO GIVE KIND OF A A RANGE OF WHAT YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS. SO WHEN I GROWTH SCENARIO THE GUARANTEE WAS GROWING ROUGHLY IN THE RANGE OF THREE POINT 4% PER YEAR -- SEC -- UNDER ARREST THE RECESSION SERIOUS NERIO WE MODELED WHICH WAS REALLY MODELING KIND OF LIKE WHAT A MODERATE RECESSION MIGHT MEAN FOR THE BUDGET. I THE GUARANTEE ENDS UP DROPPING YEAR OVER YEAR SO UNDER THAT SCENARIO IT DROPPED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ANOTHER BILLION IN. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO THE GROWTH SCENARIO YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT PERHAPS A FEW OTHER SMALLER PLANTATIONS. AND RECESSION SCENARIO AT THE GUARANTEE OFTEN TO A LEVEL WHERE YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR EXISTING SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND IN THE PAST THAT'S BEEN A CONCERN FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND AND AND FOR SOME OF THE SCHOOL GROUPS AS WELL -- SO IF YOU DID WANT TO AVOID SOME THOSE REJECT MAKING SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS IN THE FUTURE WE THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A CASE FOR BUILDING SOMEWHERE RESERVE THIS. EITHER IN YOUR STATE SCHOOL RESERVE YOUR MAIN RAINY DAY FUND ACCOUNT YOU'VE GOT DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR BUILDING DESERVES. A RIGHT NOW THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY THAT SPECIFICALLY SET ASIDE FOR SCHOOLS UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS OF THE BUDGET WE'VE CREATED RAINY DAY ACCOUNTS JUST FOR THEM. TURNING TO PAGE FIVE THIS IS REALLY SHOWING KIND OF OUR OUTLOOK FOR THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER BACK IN NOVEMBER. AND I THINK IT'S JUST. A REMINDER OF HOW QUICKLY THE PICTURE CAN CHANGE. SO. IF A RECESSION UNDER GROWTH SCENARIO -- BY THE END OF THE FOUR YEAR PERIOD THE GUARANTEE WOULD BE NEARLY NINETY BILLION DOLLARS UNDER A SESSION SCENARIO WOULD BE MORE LIKE EIGHTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS SO YOU'VE GOT A SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DIFFERENCE IN JUST A FEW YEARS BETWEEN. A GOOD ECONOMIC SCENARIO IN A PORT. ONE TURNING TO PAGE SIX THIS IS LARGELY JUSTER RECAP OF ALL OF THE PROPOSALS OF THE GOVERNOR HAS THIS YEAR I WON'T COVER ANY OF THESE IN DETAIL NOW YOU PUT ABOUT THE LAST WEEK AND YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT THEM AND FUTURE HEARING THIS -- I THINK AT COMPARED WITH PREVIOUS YEARS THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD BUDGETS YOU'RE EVER LIKELY TO SEE HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PUTTING NEARLY ALL OF THE AVAILABLE FUNDING -- TOWARDS COVERING COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT AND JUST ONE OR TWO OTHER AUGMENTATIONS IN THE CAPE OF AREA. TURN TO PAGE SEVEN I THINK MAYBE THE MOST NOTABLE DIFFERENCE FROM PREVIOUS YEAR IS. IS THE MIX OF ONE TIME AN ON GOING FUNDING -- HISTORICALLY. FOR THE PAST SIXTY SET ASIDE SOME FUNDING IN THE GUARANTEE EACH YEAR FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITY IS. AT THAT'S AVERAGE PARADE A LOT BUT IT'S AVERAGE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. AND THAT APPOACH HAS KIND OF BEEN AN INTENTIONAL CHOICE BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE TIME FUNDING BUILT INTO THE BUDGET YOU'RE GIVING YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION AGAINST FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE. IF THE GUARANTEE DROPS NEXT YEAR YOU CAN JUST LET THAT ONE TIME FUNDING EXPIRE YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO ONGOING PROGRAMS ARE THINGS THAT SCHOOLS ARE GOING TO FIND MORE DISRUPTIVE. THIS YEAR -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES VERY LITTLE IN ONE TIME FUNDING -- IN NINETEEN TWENTY JUST THREE MILLION OF HIS NINETEEN TWENTY SPENDING LEVELS FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITY IS -- ON TOP OF THAT THIS BUDGET ALSO PROPOSES USING SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAY FOR SOME ONGOING PROGRAM COSTS. AND THAT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE THIS IS A ONE TIME FUNDS TO PAY FOR ONGOING ACTIVITIES BUILD IN A LITTLE BIT OF A SHORTFALL NEXT YEAR IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE IT'S KIND OF THE FIRST CALL IN YOUR DOLLAR. FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. AND IT COULD MAKE THINGS. REDUCES THE FOR INCREASES THAT SCHOOLS MIGHT EXPECT MIGHT RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING YEAR. AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE OF A RISKIER APPROACH COMPARED TO SOME PREVIOUS BUDGET SEN -- PROBABLY WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE WHOLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGES STRUCTURED. US ARE TURNING TO PAGE. EIGHT I'LL JUST HAVE TO LITTLE BIT AM FROM KIND OF THE WAY WE WERE IN JANUARY TWO WHERE HOW THINGS MIGHT INVOLVE COME MAY. AND ON BALANCE WE THINK THAT THERE'S A BIT MORE DOWNSIDE IS AN UPSIDE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE CHANGES IN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. A PART OF THAT STORY HAS TO DO WITH REVENUE. OF THE STOCK MARKET DROPPING NOTABLY AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT AFTER THE ADMINISTRATIONOF LOCKED DOWN ITS ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS. IT'S MADE UP A LOT OF GROUND SINCE THEN BUT WE STILL THINK THERE COULD BE -- LOWER REVENUE AND INTO THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE JANUARY ESTIMATES. AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME SIGNS THAT THE ECONOMY MIGHT BE SLOWING JUST ATTACH -- INCLUDING A SMALL UPTICK IN UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND A SMALL DOWN TAKE AND HOME SALES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS YOU HEARD EARLIER THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IS SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN REVENUE. FOR EACH DOLLAR OF LOWER REVENUE WILL DROP ABOUT FIFTY FIVE CENTS IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FORTY SOMETHING DOLLARS IN. NINETEEN TWENTY AT THE OTHER PART OF THE STORY IS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO EXCLUDE SOME COSTS THAT WE THINK -- ARE VERY LIKELY TO MATERIALIZE IN THE COMING. THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS A ONE TIME PROPERTY TAX BACK FILL IN SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY I RELATED TO KIND OF AN INCORRECT ALLOCATION THAT OCCURRED IN THE COUNTY PREVIOUSLY. WE ALSO THINK THAT SOME OF YOUR FORMULA DRIVEN SPENDING IS GOING TO BE HIGHER THAN. WHAT SYSTEM IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET? THAT INCLUDES -- SOME COSTS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGE A QUESTION. AND YOUR ATTENDANCE DRIVEN COSTS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND SO BETWEEN THE LOWER GUARANTEE AND HIGHER COSTS WE THINK YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING AT KIND OF A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD MAKE YOUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. A TIGER BY THE TIME OF THE MAY REVISION. A TURNING TO PAGE NINE AS FAR AS KIND OF PREPARING FOR THAT AND HOW YOU MIGHT RESPOND -- I THINK THE NEXT. COUPLE HEARINGS WILL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO THINK THROUGH ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT. WHAT YOU'RE HIGHEST PRIORITIES ARE THINGS YOU MIGHT BE WILLING TO REJECT OR REDUCE IF THE BUDGET IS TIGHTER SENT THAT MIGHT BE THE DECISION YOU'RE FACING IN MAY? YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK ABOUT BUILDING A BIT LITTLE BIT MORE OF A BUDGET QUESTION BY REPLACING SOME OF THE GOVERNOR IS A PROPOSED ONGOING SPENDING WITH ONE TIME INITIATIVE THIS. JUST MUCH EASIER TO KIND OF PULL BACK ON THE ONE TIME THEN THE ON GOING IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO THE BALANCE THE BUDGET AND MAY. A SO FINALLY TRYING TO PAGE TEN I'LL TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRIP PROCESS AND THIS IS AS THE ADMINISTRATION TOLD YOU REALLY ABOUT THE WAY THE STATE ADDRESSES THE GUARANTEE AFTER THE YEAR IS OVER THIS IS KIND OF A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET. AND ALMOST ALL OTHER PARTS OF YOUR BUDGET YOU'RE NOT MAKING CHANGES ONCE THE FISCAL YEAR IS OVER. BUT THESE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FORMULAS CONTINUE TO CHANGE. AS AS LONG AS NINE MONTHS AFTER THE YEAR IS OVER AND SOMETIMES EVEN LONGER THAN THAT AT TRADITIONALLY. THOSE CHANGES ARE IN THE RANGE OF SAY TENS OF MILLIONS TO A FEW HUNDREDS MILLION HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS -- SO THEY CAN BE SIGNIFICANT PARTICULARLY IF YOU'RE IN A TIGHTER AND TIGHTER BUDGET SITUATION. USUALLY WHEN THE GUARANTEE IS HIGHER THAN WHAT THE STATE ESTIMATED PREVIOUSLY ARE THE STATE MAKES THE ONE TIME PAYMENT TO WHAT WE CALL SETTLE UP TO THAT HIGHER FUNDING LEVEL. WHEN THEY GET YOUR IN TEA IS LOWER THAN THE STATE ESTIMATED PREVIOUSLY WHAT WE USUALLY DO IS TAKE THAT FUNDING ABOUT THE GUARANTEE AND WE CLASSIFY IT TO BECOME IT TOWARD THE PRIOR YEAR OR SOME OTHER YEAR WE HAVEN'T ALREADY MET THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE? AT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IT'S OUT WE DO IT BECAUSE WE WANT SCHOOLS TO KEEP THE CASH THEY'VE ALREADY RECEIVED BUT WE DON'T WANT THAT HIGHER FUNDING TO BE THE BASE FOR CALCULATING NEXT YEAR SCHOOL FUNDING APPLICATION AT THE GOVERNOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET PACKAGE ESSENTIALLY PROPOSED AUTOMATING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. DIRECTLY WE HAD DONE THEM COME ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS TO TRAILER LEGISLATION LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PACKAGE WOULD HAVE JUST DIRECTED THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THM. AND IT AUTOMATICALLY UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION. AND THAT WAS DESIGNED TO MAKE CHANGES IN THE GUARANTEE A LITTLE BIT LESS DISRUPTIVE FOR SCHOOLS AS WELL AS THE REST OF THE STATE BUDGET. AFTER TURNING TO PAGE ELEVEN THE PROPOSAL'S ESSENTIALLY. AS KIND OF TWO INTERRELATED PROPOSALS. OUT ONE IS TO NOT DO THE AUTOMATIC AND THE OTHER IS TO PROHIBIT THE STATE FROM MAKING DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO SCHOOL FUNDING IN THE PRIOR YEAR WHILE STILL REQUIRING OPERATE JUST MEANT. AND I THINK IN ANALYZING THIS PROPOSAL WE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU REYES MISTER CHAIR. WHICH HAD TO DO WITH KIND OF WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE REST OF YOUR STATE BUDGET. IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSALS WE THINK YOU WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE COMMITTING TO HAVING ANY DROPS IN STATE REVENUE FALL ON THE ENTIRELY ON THE NONPROFIT THIS NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF YOUR BUDGET. AND THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOUR OVERALL BUDGET BALLENGER BALANCING TASK LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT -- BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND POTENTIALLY IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. TO AND SO WHAT WE RECOMMEND IS THAT YOU REJECT BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS AND MAINTAIN -- THE THE NEW PROCEDURES YOU PUT IN PLACE LAST YEAR WE THINK THOSE WERE OUT A CLEAR STEP FORWARD AND I GIVE THOSE LITTLE THE CHANCE. TO WORK AT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THEM. SO WITH THAT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. WERE YOU MENTION THIS. A STATE SCHOOL RESERVE ACCOUNTANT. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT CONCEPT WE DO HAVE THAT CONCEPT UNDER WHAT PROP [inaudible] TWO BUT TO THE CONDITIONS FOR MANDATORY FUNDING OF THE RESERVE ACCOUNT HAVE NOT OCCURRED. GIVEN THAT WHAT WHAT MECHANISM WOULD WE USED TO TO FUND THE STATE RESERVE ACCOUNT AYE THE FOREIGN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ASSUME -- COULD THAT BE USED TO FUND THE STATE RESERVE ACCOUNT I REALIZED AMBIENT THERE WOULD BE AN IMPACT POTENTIALLY ON ON THE LA A IS. YEAH IF YOU WERE TO USE THE FORD IN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION YOU HAVE TO MAKE SOME KIND OF REAL REDUCTION TO SCHOOLS NOT GIVE THEM AS MUCH CASH AS THEY WERE ANTICIPATING. SINCE THE YEAR IS ALREADY STARTED THEY MIGHT FIND THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE DISRUPTIVE BUT YOU COULD TAKE SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING FOR NEW PROPOSALS THIS YEAR. LIKE SAY THE SPECIAL EDUCATION PROPOSAL OR SOME OTHER PROPOSAL YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED IN FUNDING AND USE THAT TO MAKE -- TO MAKE A DEPOSIT IN THIS IN A RESERVE. AND YOU COULD DO THAT IN DIFFERENT WAYS YOU COULD MAKE AN OPTIONAL DEPOSIT IN THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE THE SAME WAY YOU'VE MADE OPTIONAL DEPOSITS IN THE REGULAR STATE RESERVE. IF YOU DON'T THINK THE FORMULAS FOR THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE I QUITE RATES YOU COULD. CREATE A NEW STATE RESERVE THAT WOULD BE JUST FOR SCHOOLS. YOUCOULD ALSO THINK ABOUT IF YOU ARE WILLING TO USE SOME OF THE STATE'S MAN RESERVE TO FUND SCHOOLS SO YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF OPTIONS THERE AND WE CAN HELP YOU AND IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT HELP YOU KIND OF THINK THROUGH THE TRADE OFFS OF THOSE DIFFERENT. OPTIONS WELL I'M SO HAVING NO HEARD. YOU KNOW THIS. NOW FOR TWO HEARINGS. AND BEFORE I AM SOMEWHAT SENSITIVE TO THE BUDGETING ISSUES IN THE EDUCATION FIELD WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUDGET FOR PROGRAMS AND YOUR THERE'S REVENUE UNCERTAINTY. WHETHER IT'S CASE YOU FOURTEEN OR A HIGHER HIGHER ED. AND HOW YOU LEVEL THAT OUT GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STATE REVENUE STREAM. AND THE WAY WE BUDGET -- YEAR BY YEAR EVEN IF WE TAKE A MULTI YEAR LOOK AND LOOK BACK. AND THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO STRUCTURE SOME SORT OF A RESERVE SYSTEM OR CUSHION. WHERE WE CAN -- DID TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE VOLATILITY OF THE REVENUE. YET ALLOWS THE SCHOOL WHETHER IT'S A K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT OR LET OR DISTRICT OR LAST WEEK WEEKS HIGHER EDUCATION FOLKS. THE FLEXIBILITY TO PLAN PROGRAMS HIGHER FACULTY. ARE TEACHERS STEP WHICH PROGRAMS AND NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH A MID COURSE CORRECTION NOW I REALIZE THAT'S WHAT THE FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IS TO ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT BUT THERE'S GOT TO BE A BETTER WAY. TO TO DO THAT IN OUR CALIFORNIA BUDGETING SYSTEM AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BASIS FOR MY FOR MY QUESTION FINANCIAL ME WILL WILL BE AS ONE MORE AND THEN WILL BE TURNED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES TO SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION. THE REUSING FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF ONE TIME SPENDING. I ASSUME YOU'RE PROJECTING CONTINUED GROWTH. AS OPPOSED TO THE RECESSION SCENARIO. YES YEAH WE ARE OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES DON'T DON'T TAKE INTO TO ACCOUNT A RECESSION CENERI SO WE ARE. ESTIMATING CONTINUED GROWTH SO WITH CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE THE THE PROGRAMS. THAT'S GOING TOWARD WILL UNDOUBTEDLY CONTINUE ASSUMING THAT GROWTH SCENARIO IN THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR YES THAT IS THE INTO. TELL YOU ANY QUESTIONS DELIVER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK MY QUESTION IS ALONG THE SAME LINES AS YOURS I AM WORRIED ABOUT. HOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS PLAN -- GIVEN THE FLUCTUATING. THE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY GET FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT MY QUESTION IS. DO WE THINK THE AVERAGE OUR DAILY GUARANTEE IS THE BEST WAY TO FIND. SCHOOLS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S THIRTY FAULT OF THE SCHOOL IF THERE ARE NOT THAT STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS DOWN BUT YOU HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TEACHERS YOU HAVE THE SAME. FACILITIES THAT YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT. IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO FIND OUR SCHOOLS. I WOULD SAY THAT -- I DON'T I DON'T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A POSITION ON IT AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS IS THE BEST WAY OR NOT BUT THAT WAS WHAT WAS INCLUDE NINETY EIGHT AND YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE MEASURE THAT -- THE VOTERS APPROVED -- I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY GET INTO ALL OF MUCH LESS CONVERSATION ABOUT MAYBE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE OR OR NOT -- BUT LIKE I SAID I DON'T THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A HAS A A POSITION CERTAINLY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED BUT FAIR ENOUGH LA A WHAT DO YOU THINK. AB USING AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE IS A LITTLE IS SIMILAR TO THE WAY YOU BUDGET OTHER PROGRAMS MOST OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE BUDGET HAVE SOME KIND OF CASE LOAD ADJUSTMENT WHETHER THAT SLOT SORTER NUMBER OF PATIENTS SERVED AND HEALTH CARE CONTEXT. SCHOOL ATTENDANCE A SORT OF THE CASELOAD MEASURE WE'VE PICKED FOR OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE IN SCHOOL FUNDING -- HAVING SOME KIND OF A YOU KNOW A KID A CASELOAD MEASURE I THINK MAKES SENSE -- I THINK WHAT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT FOR SCHOOLS NOW IS IN THE PAST THAT ADJUSTMENT IS ALWAYS BEEN VERY POSITIVE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE IS GOING 223%. IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS THAN IT WAS FLAT. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN IT STARTED DECLINING. AND THAT'S REALLY A NEW ERA FOR SCHOOL THE NUMBER WE HAVEN'T HAD A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN STUDENT ATTENDANCE FOR A COUPLE DECADES NOW BUT THAT IS KIND OF THE REALITY SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING AT BOTH FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS AND EVEN BEYOND THAT. OKAY I I WOULD CHALLENGE ALL OF US TO MAYBE THINK OF THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THANK YOU. A QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES BEGAN OFFER CENTER LABELS QUESTION ---HOW MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE DO YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE? SOME THE DECLINING -- IN ROMANS -- GIVEN. WHAT OUR DEMOGRAPHICS FOLKS ARE SAYING I THINK IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IS IS OBSERVING AS WELL? AS USE ME LIKE CAN MENTIONED -- STARTING IN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN WE'VE BEEN SEEING THIS DECLINE NOW KIND OF COMING OUT AS WE CONTINUE RECOVER FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND WHAT WE ARE -- SEEING THAT THAT IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF IS -- THE BIRTH RATES ARE DECLINING SOLD MORE AND MORE -- AND LIFE AND THEREFORE THERE'S JUST FEWER CHILDREN TO MATRICULATED UP THROUGH THE CELL THIS COULD GO ON FOR DECADES AND YOU'RE SAYING. RIGHT I ATTENTION WE SOLD BECAUSE IT'S BASED PRIMARILY ON BIRTH RATES WE WERE PRETTY CONFIDENT AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS BECAUSE EVEN IF PRESS INCREASED. TODAY YOU'VE GOT FIVE MORE YEARS BEFORE THOSE THAT LARGER COHORT ENTERS THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. I PROJECTIONS I THINK GO OUT. SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE OF FIFTEEN TWENTY TO TWENTY YEARS AND WE DO HAVE DECLINES. MODEST DECLINES OVER THAT ENTIRE PERIOD OKAY LET ME COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS. TO OF FOR EITHER ONE A VIEW -- I WATER WHAT'S THE A SPENDING PER PUPIL AND CLASS SIZES AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS AFTER THAT BUT SPENDING FOR PEOPLE OF PEOPLE ON THE AVERAGE CLASS SIZE. AND HOW DOES IT COMPARE. TO OTHER STATES AND OTHER WERE SORT OF CALIFORNIA RANK AMONG. SURE SO I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION SO PER PUPIL FUNDING UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT INTO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PUPIL IN NINETEEN TWENTY THAT'S AS HIGH AS IT'S EVER BEEN ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION. AS FAR AS CLASS SIZE -- CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT NOW THE RATIO OF TEACHERS TO STUDENTS ABOUT -- TWENTY ONE THAT'S NOT KIND OF AVERAGE CLASS SIZE THAT'S JUST TOTAL NUMBER OF FULL TIME STAFF DIVIDED BY NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- WHICH IS KIND OF IN LINE WITH THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE IT WAS ABOUT -- TWENTY ONE PRIOR TO THE GREAT RECESSION GREW QUITE A BIT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AND THE PAST COUPLE YEARS IT'S BEEN DROPPING BACK MORE TO THAT HISTORICAL. LEVEL I COMPARED TO SOME OTHER STATES THAT'S WERE HIGH WE TYPICALLY RANK A PRETTY LOW IN TERMS OF THE RATIO OF A STUDENTS TO TEACHERS. I MEAN THAT'S KIND OF FOR MANY YEARS THAT WE'VE TENDED TO HAVE. ABOVE AVERAGE CLASS SIZE. OKAY IN IN -- COUPLE OTHER COMBINED QUESTIONS IN RANKING FOR CALIFORNIA RANKS ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND TEACHER SALARIES. A TWENTY TWO SALARIES IT'S ACTUALLY JUST THE REVERSE WE'VE TEND TO RANK AMONG THE TOP FIVE STATES FOR TEACHER SALARIES. COM TO JUST TOTAL BUT I VIçT TOTAL SPENDING ON TEACHER COMPENSATION SO -- BASE SALARY WAS JUST OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND FOR THE AVERAGE TEACHER AND IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN A PLUS ANOTHER THIRTEEN THOUSAND ON AVERAGE AND HEALTH BENEFITS -- SO THAT -- THOSE NUMBERS BUT CALIFORNIA I'M IN THE TOP IN THE RANKINGS FOR TEACHER SALARY. ON STUDENT PERFORMANCE WHAT WE'VE GENERALLY BEEN RANKED LOW -- IF YOU LOOK AT SORT OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS LIKE I NEED THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTERS. AYE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN LOW ON THAT ASSESSMENT AND HAVE BEEN FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU. LET ME OF FOLLOW UP ON THAT IF I MIGHT. HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMPARISONS STATE TO STATE AND I STARTED TO SEE THEM SINCE I RECEIVE THIS NEW ASSIGNMENT [inaudible] OF SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT IN WHEREVER WASHINGTON OR SOME PLACE AND YOU SEE HERE ON THE EAST COAST. RESIST TWELVE THOUSAND HERE HAVE THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES TOASSESS WITHIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- AND STATES. RATIOS OF ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE VERSUS -- TEACHER CLASSROOM -- EXPENSE IN TERMS OF SALARIES AND NUMBERS [inaudible] JENNIFER QUESTION. I I I THINK SO REAL CLEAR QUESTION LET ME SEE ME AS GET THAT WELL LET ME START WITH THE BACKGROUND AND THEN I CAN ELABORATE. WE'VE YES WE DO COLLECTED SCHOOL ACCOUNTING DATA FROM ALL DISTRICTS AND OFFICES LIKE OURS AND I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION ANALYZE THAT. CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SPEND A FAIRLY SMALL SHARE OF THE BUDGET ACTUALLY ON KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THAT'S ONLY TEN OR 11%. IF YOU COUNT ALL EXPENDITURES ON SAY THEY'RE AUDITOR'S ON THE SCHOOL BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT AND ALL THIS SORT OF CENTRAL OFFICE STAFF -- IT'S NOT VERY HIGH. IF DISTRICTS SPEND REALLY ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THEIR BUDGET ON INSTRUCTION THE NEXT LARGEST COMPONENT IS FACILITY IS -- SO ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES JUST AS A KIND OF A SHARE OF ALL SPENDING AREN'T A BIG CHUNK OF MOST DISTRICTS BUDGETS. SO THEN IT IS A QUESTION OF HOW TO FIND OUT HOW TO FIND A WAY TO GET MORE MONEY INTO THE CLASSROOM IF IN FACT TWO THIRDS OF THE DISTRICT BUDGETS ARE GOING TO DIRECT INSTRUCTIONAL -- EFFORTS. RIGHT. IN THE STATE. I'M NOT SURE I HAVE ANY SORT OF I MEAN IF THERE'S AYE A GREAT IF THE I DON'T KNOW OF ANY STUDIES THAT HAVE TRIED TO STAY WELL COULD WE TAKE HOW MUCH WORSE SPENDING ON ADMINISTRATION NOW AND KIND OF SHIFT EVEN MORE OF THAT -- TO THE CLASSROOM THE STATE'S TRIED TO DO SOME THINGS LIKE THAT IN THE PAST I WITH. SAY CAPS ON STUDENT TEACHER RATIOS AND REQUIRING MINIMUM SHARES OF THE BUDGET TO GO TOWARDS INSTRUCTION -- I DON'T KNOW OF ANY EVALUATIONS OF LOOKED AT WHETHER THOSE HAVE. ARE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT RELATIVELY LOW SHERIFF THAT SOMETHING THAT DISTRICT WITH ON THEIR OWN. WELL SO YOU KNOW SOME OF US ARE JUST FRUSTRATED AS TO HOW WE HOW WE DO MORE. FOR A VERY VERY IMPORTANT AREA. OF OUR STATE OPERATION AND THAT'S OF EDUCATION AND IN PARTICULAR TEACHING STUDENTS IN THAT CASE THROUGH TWELVE IN CASE YOU FOURTEEN SYSTEM AND HOW DO WE GET MORE MONEY. INTO INTO WHEREVER THE CLASSROOM TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. AND THE BUDGET IS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH IT'S FAIRLY STAGGERING -- AND LOOKING AT OPTIONS AND WE'RE TO FIND MONEY TO PUT MORE MONEY WHERE THE MONEY IS NEEDED AND THAT IS IN THE CLASSROOM -- VISIT HIGH COST STATE SO TEACHERS OF WE MAY BE HIGH ON THE LIST IN TERMS OF TEACHERS' SALARY AND BENEFITS BUT IT ALSO COSTS A LOT OF MONEY TO LIVE HERE AND WE CERTAINLY WANT. HIGH QUALITY TEACHERS LIVING HERE AND TEACH THAT'S THE GENESIS OF MY QUESTION AND IT PROBABLY WASN'T AS CLEAR AS IT SHOULD BE SO. STAY TUNED GIVE ME A FEW MORE WEEKS HERE AND I MAY GET BETTER AT THAT. QUICK COLLEAGUES ANY FOR THE QUESTION ELEVEN ONE QUICK FOLLOW UP WHEN YOU SEE 10211% ON OVERHEAD WHAT FALLS AND OVERHEAD. BUT WE COULD GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC LESS BUT IT'S THINGS LIKE THE EXPENSES OF THE SCHOOL BOARD THE SUPERINTENDENT OR SUPERINTENDENT'S DEPUTY IS FOR THE CENTRAL OFFICE EXPENSES SO NOT THE SCHOOL SITE PRINCIPAL OR AND THIS. EXPENSES AT THE SCHOOL SITE. COULD BE THINGS LIKE -- LIKE SAY THE CONTRACT FOR THE AUDITOR'S OR FOR FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE KIND OF ALL THINGS LIKE THAT AND I THAT PERCENTAGE DOES FLUCTUATE SO WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF ON THE SPECIFIC AMOUNT. FOR THAT'S OKAY I WAS JUST CURIOUS WHAT FALLS UNDER THAT BECAUSE YOU SAID 10211% IS RATHER LOW SO DOES THAT MEAN THAT SUPERINTENDENTS. UP INTO THE CITY CALIFORNIA THEIR SALARIES ARE WITHIN RANGE. OF WHAT OTHER STATES ARE PAYING. I DON'T KNOW OF ANYONE WHO COMPILES DATA ON CONSUMER INTENDANTS ALREADY WE HAVE IT MORE FOR THE TEACHERS IDE. I THINK IT'S MORE OF A A FUNCTION. OF JUST NOT HAVING ALL THAT MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE IN A DISTRICT IF YOU LOOK AT KIND OF WHO THE PEOPLE ARE WHO MAKE UP A DISTRICT STAFF. WHAT OVERWHELMINGLY TEACHERS AND -- KIND OF SUPPORT STAFF SECRETARIES BUS DRIVERS CLERICAL WORKERS -- THAT THE CENTRAL OFFICE STAFF JUST AREN'T A VERY BIG HERE OF ALL THE STAFF THAT INTO DISTRICT BUCKLEY EMPLOYS GOTCHA I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS I'VE BEEN MADE AWARE OF A A COUPLE SUPERINTENDENTS THAT ARE MAKING. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND SO JUST CURIOUS WHERE WE FALL INTO THAT SO THAT'S GOOD THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COLLEAGUES. GENERAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER TWO LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AFTER HER READY THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO REMAIN WITH US SIR PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR THE RECORD OF SERVICE TWO OF YOU OKAY. AND HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HOWARD THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. ANDERSON THANK YOU. WHO WANTS TO PROCEED -- I GET STARTED MORNING MORNING -- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY INCLUDES A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND INCREASE. FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THIS INCREASE REFLECTS A THREE POINT 46% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. IN A POINT 12% DECLINE IN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. OVERALL THIS BUDGET BRINGS TOTAL LCF OF FUNDING. TO SIXTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND BRINGS THE TOTAL OF NEW ON GOING FUNDING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE HAVE RECEIVED. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN TO TWENTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL NINE BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO REFLECT A THREE POINT 46% COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. AN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE CHANGES UNDER THE INCLUDING THE MINIMUM STATE AID THIS BRINGS TOTAL LCF FUNDING FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. TO APPROXIMATELY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A PROBE UP PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH A MECHANISM. WHEREBY THE ADMINISTRATION CAN ASSESS THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE COLA. ON THE CFF FROM THEBUDGET YEAR WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND ALL OTHER SPENDING PRIORITIES AND AUTOMATICALLY APPLY AN ALTERNATIVE COLA TO THE FORMULA IF NECESSARY. WITH THEM TO BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE HELLO. YEAH RYAN ANDERSON WITH ALEJO AND JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK COMMENTS. OVERALL -- OUR OFFICE CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT THE L. CFF HAS SEVERAL ADVANTAGES. OVER THE STATE'S PREVIOUS SCHOOL FINANCE SYSTEM SO -- WHAT WE RECOMMEND -- SUPPORTING THE IT MAY A PROVIDING MOST ON GOING K. TWELVE FUNDING TO THAT FORMULA. HOWEVER ON TWO ASPECTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE DO HAVE CONCERNS THE FIRST -- CONCERNS THIS CALL A CAB THE FINANCE JUST MENTIONED SO THE WE ARE WE THINK PUTTING FORWARD. OF THIS PROPOSAL IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE REALITY THAT THE CHANGE THE STATE MADE LAST YEAR TO AUTOMATICALLY PROVIDE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT. TO THEY'LL CFF IS NOT GOING TO BE ACTIONABLE IN ALL BUDGET SITUATIONS THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST PROGRAM. AND THE GENERAL FUND OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW AND THERE WILL BE SOME YEARS WHERE THE STATE'S SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD. TO PROVIDE THE FULL STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THAT AND IN FACT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINETY ONE THE STATE HAS NOT PROVIDED THE FULL STATUTORY I K. TWELVE COLA IN ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL YEARS. NOW. WE THINK RATHER THAN IMPOSING THIS NEW -- FORMULA WHICH WILL BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WILL MAKE THAT BUDGET. PROCESS LESS TRANSPARENT WILL WE WOULD RECOMMEND JUST RETURNING TO THE STATE'S TRADITIONAL PRACTICE OF PROVIDING AUGMENTATIONS. ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS JUST EVERY YEAR -- IT YOU WILL EVALUATE THE BUDGET CONDITION AND MAKE A DECISION ABOUT. CAN WE PROVIDE A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THIS PROGRAM AND IF SO WHAT SIZE OF THAT INVESTMENT. THE OTHER CONCERN WE HAVE -- CONCERNS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF FORMULA AND SPECIFICALLY THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISIONS SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BRAD BACKGROUND HERE. PRIOR. TO THIRTEEN FOURTEEN OF ONE COUNTY OFFICES RECEIVED ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE THE STATE REDUCED ITS. OF FUNDING FOR THOSE COUNTY OFFICES DOLLAR FOR DOLLARS SO WE WE DID NOT. ART IN MOST CASES DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR SO WE DO NOT ALLOW COUNTY OFFICES TO RECEIVE DISPROPORTIONATELY GREATER FUNDING BASED SOLELY ON THEIR PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS. OF WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MINIMUM STATE A PROVISION IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN WE PUT A CAP ON HOW MUCH THAT STATE FUNDING COULD BE REDUCED FOR GROWTH AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. AS A RESULT. COUNTY OFFICES THAT ARE SAYING ESPECIALLY RAPID INCREASES IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS NOW RECEIVE DISPROPORTIONATELY GREATER. FUNDING AMOUNTS THIS LEADS TO SOME CONCERNS WE HAVE ABOUT INEQUITIES IN THE IRRATIONAL INEQUITIES IN COUNTY OFFICE. OF FUNDING BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT ADEQUATELY. I'D ACCOUNT FOR THE FULL COST OF THIS PROVISION. I'D. DOUBLE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S LONGSTANDING PRACTICE IS JUST TO TAKE THE MOST RECENT. DATA FOR THE COSTA MINIMUM STATE AID AND TO HOLD THAT FLAT ACROSS THE THREE YEARS IN THE BUDGET WINDOW. WHEN IN FACT WE KNOW PROPERTY TAX VALUES ARE INCREASING UNLESS THE THE COST OF THIS PROVISION IS INCREASING YOUR OVER HERE OUR OFFICES PROJECTIONS SHOW THAT? WE WE PROJECT THAT THE FULL COST OF THIS PROVISIONAL BE ABOUT FORTY MILLION. A MORE THAN THE ADMINISTRATION CURRENTLY AUGUST ON THE LAST PANEL IS NOT MUCH OF A CUSHION WITHIN OUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE RIGHT NOW. SO WE DO THINK THAT THIS UNACCOUNTED FOR COSTA SOMETHING. THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING [inaudible] AS A WELL WITH RESPECT TO THIS WITH RESPECT TO THE SO. SERIES AND AND THE ONES THAT -- ARE LOCATED IN AREAS WHERE PROPERTY TAX THIS IS DRAMATICALLY INCREASING DUE TO A ROOM STAGGERING INCREASES IN PROPERTY VALUES WHERE IS THAT MONEY GO DOES IT STAY WITHIN THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OR WHAT. AND SO IT DEPENDS -- TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND THAT THE LIMIT OF THE COUNTY OFFICE OF FUNDING IS DECIDED BOTH BY ITS PRIMARY FUNDING FORMULA ENTITLEMENT AND BY ITS MINIMUM STATE A PROVISION. SO. IF THERE'S STILL ROOM WITHIN -- THAT ENTITLEMENT AMOUNT THE ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE WILL STAY WITH THE COUNTY OFFICE SOME COUNTY OFFICES HOWEVER CAPPED OUT -- THEIR PROPERTY TAX REVENUES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THEY'RE ENTITLED A THIRD TOTAL LCF ENTITLEMENT. AND THEIR STATE FUNDING EXACTLY EQUALS THEIR MINIMUM STATE AID FORMULA AND THOSE CASES THE ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES ACTUALLY RIVER TO THE COUNTY COURTS [inaudible] SO. ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT THE FOR THOSE CUNTIES WHERE THE PROPERTY TAX IS. HIS HIGH IS HIGH [inaudible] LISA RECEIPTS. THAT THAT MONEY BE REDISTRIBUTED TO OTHER COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT. TO EXPERIENCING THE SAME RAPID GROWTH IN. PROPERTY TO AND PROPERTY VALUES IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. ED SO LET MECHANISM WOULD HAVE. TO BE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THAT BECAUSE PROPOSITION -- THIRTEEN LIMITS THE STATE'S ABILITY. TO ALLOCATE PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS ACROSS STATE LINES BUT THERE ISSUE ACTUALLY HERE IS ON THE PROPERTY TAX VALUES THAT THE STATE FUNDING SO THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISIONS SAYS. THAT IN THESE COUNTY IS WHERE. PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS MIGHT BE ENOUGH THAT WE COULD FIND THE COUNTIES ENTITLED AN ENTIRE LCF ENTITLEMENT WITHOUT ANY STATE FUNDING. THE STATE WILL STILL HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM SOME FUNDING ON TOP OF THAT PROPERTY TAX COLLECTION JUST TO ENSURE. THAT THEIR TOTAL STATE FUNDING IS NO LESS THAN IT WAS IN. THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IF WE WERE TO SAY I OR PUT A CAP ON IT AND SAY FOR INSTANCE. THAT THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISIONAL NOW BE STATE FUNDING CAN BE NO LESS THAN IT WAS AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT THAT WOULD NOT FREE UP PROPERTY TAX REVENUE AND FREE UP STATE FUNDING THAT COULD BE ALLOCATED. TO ANY K. TWELVE PURPOSES THAT REQUIRE A MODIFICATION TO PROP. NINETY EIGHT IT DOES NOT WE THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO THAT YES. SO WE WOULD ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. TO THESE COUNTY OFFICES. IN QUE IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COUNTY PROPERTY VALUES AND PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. ARE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH AND THE COUNTY OFFICES CAN OR WE CAN WEEK WE CAN MEET OUR MINIMUM OBLIGATION TO TO THOSE OFFICES. BY A COMBINATION OF A REDUCE GENERAL FUND ALLOCATION AND THE PROPERTY TAX THAT THEY RECEIVE THAT'S CORRECT IN WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY A GUARANTEE YOU WOULD THEN HAVE. A POTENTIALLY TENS OF MILLIONS POTENTIALLY OVER A HUNDRED MILLION OF OF STATE FUNDING THAT. YOU COULD DEDICATE TO ANY OTHER CAREFUL PURPOSE YOU COULD ALLOCATED OTHER COUNTY OFFICES YOU CAN ALLOCATED. SAID DISTRICTS ANY PURPOSE AT THE LEGISLATURE'S OFFICE NOW WITH RESPECT TO THOSE COUNTIES WHERE THE EXCESS MONEY IS. DISTRIBUTED TO THE COURT SYSTEM TO HELP BY ASSUME WITH COURT OPERATIONS WHEELER WOULD THERE BE A CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND FROM THAT SIDE. A NO SO OUR RECOMMENDATION AGAIN WOULD WOULD JUST BE TO AMEND THE MINIMUM THE STATE AID PROVISION AND THE ONLY IMPACTS THERE WOULD BE ON STATE FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT SO. ANY ALLOCATIONS TO ACTUAL PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS WOULD BE UNAFFECTED BY A RECOMMENDATION. CONFUSING. I GET IT I THINK OKAY -- FINANCE ANY COMMENT. I DON'T PUT YOU ON THE SPOT. I THINK WE WOULD JUST SAY -- AND WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THAT PROPOSAL -- IT YET -- AND THAT THE MINIMUM CITY PROVISION WHILE WE FEEL WAS A AN IMPORTANT YOU KNOW PROVISION I WAS PART OF THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND TWELVE THIRTEEN UNDER LCF HALF -- BUT WE HAVE NO LIKE I SAID POSITION -- IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSAL THAT DAILY I WAS SPEAKING OF AS FAR AS THE THE PROJECTION GOES SO NOT SPEAKING -- TO WHAT WHAT THE MISTER ANDERSON WAS SPEAKING TO IN REGARDS OF MAY BE OTHER WAYS THAT THAT MONEY COULD BE BUDGETED FOR OTHER PURPOSES OR WHAT HAVE YOU WITHIN THE GUARANTEE -- SOLELY REGARDING OUR PROJECTION THAT IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH THEM ABOUT IN TERMS OF MAYBE BETTER IDENTIFYING WHAT THAT CHANGE WOULD BE WE BELIEVE IT TO BE POTENTIALLY LOAD LOW MILLIONS LOW TENS OF MILLIONS WE ARE. I'M SURE OF IT YOU KNOW IF WE AGREE NECESSARILY ON SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING INTO AND AND COLLABORATING WITH THEM ON SO THAT IN IN MAY WE CAN HAVE THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ALL A BIT MORE AND AND POTENTIALLY FUTURE BUDGETS AS WELL. SO THAT THAT'S TAKING INTO ACCOUNT IN THE FALL FOR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF NINETY PACK. THESE ARE PROP THESE ARE PROBABLY ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL I THINK [inaudible] OKAY. I HAVE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS NUMERO NOT HERE. GENERAL THANK YOU. BY THE WAY WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE NEXT -- ISSUE WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE STATEWIDE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM UPDATE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US I WILL ASK YOU TO INTRODUCE YOURSELVES FOR THE RECORD STARTING TO MY LEFT IN YOUR RIGHT IF YOU'RE READY SIR WE CAN START WITH YOU. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATED FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE SEE SEE YOU. MISTER MOLINA I'M TRYING TO GET THAT ACRONYM DOWN HERE. NUMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AGAIN DAN HAD ARE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THERE CORTES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. DAVID SEVEN BOARD OF EDUCATION. CARICATURED UPPITY SUPERINTENDENT CD. THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING US WHO WANTS TO START. GOOD MORNING -- SERRA CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATE THE CAN OF ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM INCLUDING A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLES AND THE ACTORS IN THE STATE SYSTEM. A MIDDLE SPEAK BE SPEAKING FROM THE HANDOUT THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED TO YOUR OWN. SO TO START ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT THE CHANGE IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM BEGAN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF LCF OFF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AND ATTACHED TO THE LEGISLATION THAT CREATED LC A FIVE WAS A NEW ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORK THAT'S BEEN ROLLED OUT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. PART OF THE NEW FRAMEWORK THE STATE ADOPTED EIGHT STATE PRIORITY AREAS AND THESE PRIORITY AREAS ARE LISTED ON THE FIRST BULLET OF YOUR HAND OUT -- AND THESE ARE THE STATUTORILY DEFINED A TESTIFIED THE KEY THINGS THAT THE STATE THINGS ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS TO FOCUS ON IN EACH PRIORITY AREA IS WILLING TO PERFORMANCE MEASURE. THAT DETERMINE HOW WELL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ARE DOING. THE STATE ALSO PUTS INTO PLACE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS -- WHERE DISTRICTS DEVELOP A PLAN WITH GOALS AND ACTIONS ON HOW THEY PLAN TO IMPROVE IN THE EIGHT STATE PRIORITY AREAS? AND DISTRICTS HAVE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES I'M HAVE TO GET THEIR EL CAP TO PUT APPROVED BY THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. SO NOW PRIORITY AREAS PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND L. CAPS THEY ALL WORK TOGETHER SO FOR EXAMPLE A DISTRICT FOR DISTRICT TO DEVELOP EL CAP THEY HAVE TO HAVE A GOAL THAT FOCUSES ON A PRIORITY AREA SO ARE IT FOR EXAMPLE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT. ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AS GRADUATION RATES SO WOULD DISTRICT WILL HAVE TO HAVE A GOAL THAT DETAILS THE STEPS AND HOW THEY WILL IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES IN THEIR EL CAP. SO MOVING ON TO PAGE TWO OF THE HAND OUT WILL DISCUSS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. THE STATE ASSESSES IS JUST DISTRICT PERFORMANCE THROUGH STATUTORILY DEFINED MEASURES AND THOSE RESULTS ARE DISPLAYED ON THE DASHBOARD WHICH IS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WEBSITE. USING THE RESULT OF THE DASHBOARD AT THE STATE IDENTIFIES DISTRICTS THAT NEED ASSISTANCE. THE STATE LOOKS AT EVERY STUDENT GROUP PERFORMANCE FOR EVERY PRIORITY AREA AND IF A DISTRICT HAS A STUDENTS SUBGROUP IN THE LOWEST PERFORMANCE CATEGORY FOR TWO OR MORE PRIORITY AREAS. THERE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SUPPORT. IN THE FALL THE STATE IDENTIFIED THREE HUNDRED ANDFORTY THREE DISTRICTS THIRTY ONE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AS NEEDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 65% OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING SUPPORT WAS BECAUSE THE PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH THEIR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR THAT THE STATE HAS IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS ON THAT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. I'M IN THE FUTURE THE STATE WILL IDENTIFY -- DISTRICTS THAT EVE THAT NEED AN EVEN GREATER LEVELS OF OF SUPPORT BUT THAT SUPPORT IS FORTHCOMING. ON PAGE THREE OF THE HAND OUT ALL DISCUSS THE ENTITIES INTENDED TO SUPPORT THESE DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT FUNDED ENTITIES AND ESTABLISH ROLES THAT THESE ENTITIES WOULD HAVE IN THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. ON THESE ENTITIES INCLUDE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WHO PROVIDE SUPPORT DIRECTLY TO DISTRICTS. THE COUNTY OFFICES COULD ALSO HELP THE DISTRICT FIND A TEAM OF EXPERTS TO SUPPORT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND THEN THE DISTRICTS COULD ALSO OPT OUT OF SUPPORT BY FINDING THEIR OWN SUPPORT. THERE'S ALSO LEAD AGENCIES EITHER COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN L. PLAN AREAS I'M STILL BUZZ -- AND OTHER CAL. I'M SELF WAS AND THESE THESE KELLY AGENCIES SUPPORT OTHER COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION DISTRICTS OR IN THE SELFLESS CASE THAT THEY SUPPORT OTHER SELF AS YOU MAY HEAR LEAD AGENCY THE LEAVES REFER TO AS GEOGRAPHICALLY THEIR SELF A LEADS. AND THERE'S OTHER LEADS -- BUT THESE ARE THE MAIN ONES THAT ARE UP -- AND THEN THERE'S THE COLLABORATIVE THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND THIS IS A STATE WIDE AGENCY THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN AND THE C. C. E. HELP COORDINATE SUPPORT AMONG THE AGENCIES. AND MAY ALSO DIRECTLY SUPPORT DISTRICTS. SO ON PAGE FOUR OF YOUR HANDOUT DESCRIBES FUNDING FOR DISTRICT SUPPORT AND THIS IS THE MJOR ONGOING FUNDING PROVIDED FOR THESE ENTITIES. SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY COUNTY IN THE NINETEEN TYPE TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE PROVIDED FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION TO SUPPORT -- THROUGH THE COUNTY OFFICE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND THIS IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT ALL DISTRICTS NOT JUST THOSE THAT WERE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN THERE'S SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PROVIDED TO COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT THOSE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED DISTRICTS THIS FUNDING IS PROVIDED BASED ON A FORMULA -- THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED WITH IN EACH COUNTY AND THE SIZE OF THOSE DISTRICTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET -- INCLUDES TWENTY INCLUDES A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FROM THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS IDENTIFIED. LEAD AGENCIES THEIR PROVIDED TECH -- TEN MILLION FOR CELL BELIEVES AND THEN FOR MILLION FOR COUNTY OFFICE GEOGRAPHICALLY IT'S AND THEN THE C. C. E. IS PROVIDED TEN MILLION. SO THIS IS A SYSTEM AS IT RELATES TO PROVIDING DISTRICTS SUPPORT -- YOUR AGENDA ALSO NOTES THE THE STATE IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT SCHOOLS. ON THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT SCHOOLS WERE IDENTIFIED AND THEN THE REST OF THE PANEL WILL PROVIDE OR SOME OF THE PANEL WILL PROVIDE. AN UPDATE ON THE STATE'S PROGRESS AND SUPPORTING SCHOOL. HOPEFULLY SOMEONE WILL COVER SO WITH RESPECT TO THESE A REGIONAL ROLES IN THESE LEAD AGENCIES AND THE MONEY IS BUDGETED -- IS THERE SOME REPORTING REQUIREMENT IN THE SYSTEM OF METRIC SO OF THIS -- SOME A A LEAD AGENCY FOR OUR REGION IS IS TRACKING THE RESULTS OF ITS EFFORTS AND AND THE EXPENDITURE MONEY I MEAN IT'S PRETTY BUT I WOULD IMAGINE WITHIN A COUNTY OF OFFICE OF EDUCATION THEY HAVE A SYSTEM OF METRICS I JUST WONDER IF THERE IS. ONE THAT EXTENDS OUT TO THESE REGIONAL THIS REGIONAL EFFORT TO THAT FOR EXAMPLE RIVERSIDE SEVERINO. SEE WE SEE -- EASE -- HAVE RESPONSIBILITY I'M JUST WONDERING IF THEY MEASURE WHAT THEY DO. I'M SO THIS IS A THIS IS -- THE CC WILL BE PROVIDING AN UPDATE -- AND THAT CAN I CAN WAIT IT OUT AND I WAS JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS ALL -- QUITE NEWS OF THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION AS IT WAS FOUNDED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT SOMETIMES SOMETIMES WE PUT MONEY IN THE PIPELINE AND DON'T HAVE SOME. EXPECTATIONS THE COMPANY THAT MONEY I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE DO. OKAY NEXT. THANK YOU AGAIN CHARACTER ACTUALLY -- DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- SO -- AT TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE RELEASED -- THE DASHBOARD -- IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR WE SPENT A LOT OF EFFORT ON MAKING THE THE DASHBOARD TECHNICALLY ACCURATE AND WORKING -- APPROPRIATELY -- SO WE RECEIVED A LOT OF FEEDBACK THAT THE DASHBOARD WASN'T AS USER FRIENDLY -- FOR PERHAPS THE THE THE AVERAGE PARENT OR COMMUNITY MEMBER SO -- THE THE BUDGET DIDN'T MONEY FOR AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE DASHBOARD WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN LAST YEAR. SO WE JUST RELEASED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN DASHBOARD IN DECEMBER WITH A NUMBER OF THESE UPGRADES INCLUDING -- LOOKING AT THE INTERFACE ON HOW THE DASHBOARD WORKS -- IT'S NOW FULLY TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH -- AND WE'RE HOPING IN FUTURE YEARS TO HAVE OTHER LANGUAGE IS -- ADDED TO THAT -- TRANSLATION WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PAGES ACTUALLY IN THE DASHBOARD BY 0%. SO THAT -- PARENTS ESPECIALLY BUT ANYONE -- ACCESSING THE DASHBOARD IS NOT CLICKING AWAY FROM THE SITE AND THEN CLICKING BACK AND MOVING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN PAGES MAKING A LOT MORE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE RIGHT ON THE PAGE THAT THERE THERE ON SOLD. WELL -- THE NUMBER OF OF PEOPLE THAT ARE YOU TRACKING THAT AND THAT HAS INCREASED. THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN FROM -- PARENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS I IS THAT IT IS MUCH MORE USER FRIENDLY INCLUDING THE ACTUAL -- IMAGES THAT ARE USED -- TO STARTED WITH -- USING SOME CIRCLES AND SLICES OF BOOK LIKE PIES -- AND NOW GONE TO TO SOMETHING THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE A GAS GAUGE THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN YOUR CAR'S DASHBOARD SOMETHING THAT. MOST PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH -- SO WE'VE THE FEEDBACK WE'VE GOTTEN IS THAT -- IT IS MUCH MORE -- FRIENDLY AND FOR THE FOR THE AVERAGE USER THE FEDS LIKE THIS. ONE WELL THEY LIKE IT MORE THAN THEY LIKE THE LAST ONE IN FACT OUR OUR TO OUR TO OUR DIVISION THAT -- IS THAT MAINLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS HAS BEEN ASKED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PRESENT OUR DASHBOARD -- TO OTHER STATES SO -- THEY MAY NOT AGREE WITH EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IN THE DASHBOARD BUT THEY DO LIKE NOW THE DESIGN. AND THEY DO LIKE THAT MULTIPLE MEASURES THAT WERE USING I THINK THE QUITE FRANKLY THAT CALIFORNIA'S ON THE LEADING EDGE. OF OF AN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM IN THE DASHBOARD -- FOR PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST STATE INDICATORS WERE THE STATE -- DEVELOP THESE CALCULATIONS AND AND REPEATS THEM BACK OUT -- BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES SOME LOCAL INDICATORS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE -- TO THAT DASHBOARD LOCAL INFORMATION THAT THE STATE DOESN'T HALF SO THE COMBINATION OF STATE INFORMATION AS WELL AS LOCAL INFORMATION WHICH IS PRETTY UNIQUE ACROSS ALL STATES AND TOMORROW. THANK YOU ON ON THE DASHBOARD -- IT'S NICE I I LIKE IT BUT ON THE BREAK DOWN THOSE NUMBERS EVEN CLOSER THAN DASHBOARD -- DO YOU HAVE A PLACE FOR THE PARENTS CAN GOAL TO SAY THEY'RE GOING TO BE MOVING INTO A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD NURSERY -- SCHOOLS IN THAT CITY AND THERE. TRYING TO MOVE TO THE LOCATION THAT IS THE BEST SCHOOL WE ACTUALLY -- COMPARE STATISTICS SIDE BY SIDE SO IT GETS DOWN TO THE ACTUAL. NUMBERS. SO WHAT WITH THERE ARE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS WE DO NOT I WOULDN'T SAY WE DO ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE. BUT WE DO WE DO HAVE SOME FUNCTIONALITY THATASSIST WITH THAT FOR INSTANCE YOU CAN LOOK AT ALL THE SCHOOLS WITHIN A DISTRICT SO. SO IF THE IF A PARENT IS CERTAINLY LOOKING TO MOVE THEIR CHILD. AT THE SCHOOLS WITH IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREA THEN THAT CAN BE DONE THROUGH THE DASHBOARD WE DO HAVE A FUNCTIONALITY THAT ALLOWS. FOR A ANYONE TO COMPARE THERE'S HOW THE STATE IS DOING OVERALL-SO YOU CAN YOU CAN MAKE THAT COMPARISON TO SEE IF. AT MIT AM I ABOVE I AM ABOUT THE STATE AVERAGE OR MY BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT I MEAN WILL GIVE THE ACTUAL PERCENTAGES PER SCHOOL OF BREAKING DOWN AND MATH SCIENCES. SCIENCE -- INFLATION COMPARED WITH OTHER SCHOOLS. THE ACTUAL NUMBERS. RIGHT SO SO I AM NOT SURE I QUITE UNDERSTAND THE THE THE QUESTION BUT THERE ARE LOW. THERE ARE A LOT OF THERE IS A LOT OF ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COMPARE -- WITHIN A DEBT THE SCHOOLS WITHIN A DISTRICT WHICH IS WHERE MOST PARENTS ARE LOOKING AT THE OTHER THING THAT THAT I THINK IT DOES IS -- IT HAS THAT THAT DASHBOARD WITH A NUMBER OF GAUGES FOR ALL OF THOSE MULTIPLE -- MEASURES THE DIFFERENT INDICATORS THAT WE HAVE IN A SINGLE PLACE. BECAUSE WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS THAT PARENTS WANT TO CHOOSE A SCHOOL FOR A PARTICULAR REASON OFTEN -- THEY MAY BE INTERESTED IN ACADEMICS AND THEY WANT TO LOOK AT THE ASSESSMENT. RESULTS BUT MAYBE WHAT THEY'RE MOST INTERESTED IN IS IS THE IS THE SCHOOL HAVE A GOOD -- COMMUNITY RIGHT IS THERE IS THERE IS THERE -- HOW HOW IS THE SAFETY RIGHT SO WITH SO ONE OF THE SUSPENSION RATES LOOK LIKE IN THAT SCHOOL OR PERHAPS THERE -- PARENT OF AN ENGLISH LEARNERS SO THEY WANT. A CATEGORY SO IT BY DOING THAT MULTIPLE MEASURES IT DOES ALLOW PARENTS TO FOCUS ON A SINGLE MEASURE AS WELL AS LOOKING AT OVERALL HOW A SCHOOL IS DOING -- SO I WISH I COULD CONTINUE. SO -- WE DID -- SERVE AN INTERACTIVE PROCESS. I APPRECIATE THAT SO -- WE DID IDENTIFY -- DISTRICTS -- SERRA WAS SAYING -- FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE I WON'T GO INTO THE ACTUAL NUMBERS IN THE DETAILS THEY ARE IN IN YOUR INFORMATION BUT I CAN CERTAINLY ADDRESS THOSE IF. IF IF YOU HAVE -- QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT. USING THE LOCAL CONTROL -- FOR A UNDING FORMULA AND THE THE PHILOSOPHY BEHIND THAT WE DO BELIEVE THAT -- I THINK HISTORY. EXPERIENCE -- AND SOME SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN US THAT -- HAVING DECISIONS MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS LOCAL AS POSSIBLE I HAS A BETTER CHANCE OF BEING SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE WHICH IS IMPORTANT -- FOR MAKING CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENTS -- IN IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY HAVING THAT THE OLD SYSTEM UNDER NCLB WAS VERY TOP DOWN IT WAS VERY -- DC SACRAMENTO I DIRECTED FOR WHAT SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS HAD TO DO I WAS VERY SPECIFIC STEPS ONCE THEY WERE IDENTIFIED. THIS MUCH MORE PUTS THE OWNERSHIP DOWN INTO THE COMMUNITY INTO COUNTY OFFICES WHERE THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE LOCATED SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT ASSIST THEM BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND. IS THAT IF A IF A SCHOOL FOR INSTANCE IS NOT DOING WELL IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS THERE MAY BE MULTIPLE REASONS FOR THAT THERE'S NOT A SINGLE REASON. IT COULD BE THE INSTRUCTION BUT IT COULD BE MATERIALS IT COULD BE -- STUDENT ATTENDANCE IT COULD BE THIS AT THE SAFETY IN THE SCHOOL THERE COULD BE A LOT OF REASONS SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT LOCAL COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS AND THE DATA -- THAT GOES WITH THAT LOCAL. COMMUNITY SO MOVING AWAY AS WE HAVE FROM AND SEE -- BE -- TO THE NEW -- FEDERAL REAUTHORIZATION **** OUT EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT IT DOES ALLOW FOR A MORE FLEXIBILITY IN OUR ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM WHICH WE'VE DONE TO A GREAT DEAL OF EXTENT TO THE X. GREATEST EXTENT. POSSIBLE -- THERE ARE STILL SOME DISCONNECTS BETWEEN -- WHAT CALIFORNIA? WOULD LIKE TO BUT WE HAVE COMBINED THOSE IN A SINGLE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. SALAS AGAIN SERRA WAS MENTIONING -- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES US TO IDENTIFY SCHOOLS -- FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT AND SO WE HAVE DONE THAT AS OF JANUARY -- WE STILL THINK THAT THE THE AGENCY OF CHANGE IS GOING TO BE THE DISTRICT NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL -- I THINK AGAIN RESEARCH HAS SHOWN US UNDER NCLB THAT IF YOU FOCUS DOWN TO A SCHOOL LEVEL FROM THE STATE TO THE SCHOOL -- YOU CAN MAKE SMALL AMOUNT OF CHANGES FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME BUT IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE REALLY HAVE TO BUILD CAPACITY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO HELP THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. I HELP THEIR SCHOOLS AND SUSTAIN WHATEVER GAINS THEY CAN MAKE SO -- THOSE WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS AND AGAIN SERRA WAS MENTIONING -- THERE WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET PUTTING MONEY INTO THE COUNTY OFFICES OF THE COUNTY OFFICES CAN HELP BUILD THE CAPACITY IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN HELP THEMSELVES. AND HELP THEIR SCHOOLS -- IS WHAT HAS JUST -- BEGAN OTHER -- CDP THE STATE BOARD CCE ARMY TOGETHER REGULARLY AND MEET WITH THESE LEAD TO THE AGENCIES THAT AGAIN SERRA WAS MENTIONING. TO COORDINATE THE EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE CALIBRATED -- AND TO OUR AND FOLKS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE -- LEAD AGENCIES AND OF COURSE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE TO WORK AND SO I THINK I'LL STOP THERE AND THE WHAT SO WHAT'S THE RIVER HOW DO WE WHAT'S THE METRIC. IN THIS NEW -- DOES. WE HAVE ISSUE EASES REGIONAL LEADS. WHAT'S THE METRIC AND WHAT'S THE REPORTING PROCESS THAT WE HAVE THE DASHBOARD FOR INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS CRACK WHAT'S WHAT'S THE REPORTING METRIC HERE AND HOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER THIS. NEW SYSTEM IS AFFECTED BY GUESS OBVIOUSLY ONE MEASURE IS IF THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS. TURN FROM RED TO GREEN ON YOUR DASHBOARD. BUT THERE MAY BE REASONS OTHER REASONS WHY THEY DON'T GO FROM RED TO GREEN AND THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INDICATE OF A FAILURE OR INADEQUATE. INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE ON THE PART OF THE REGIONAL LEAD SO. AT SOME POINT SOMEONE CAN ADDRESS THAT BUT SIR PLEASE PROCEED. DAVID SEVEN STABLE OF EDUCATIONAL JUST ADDRESS THAT CA MR MOLINO THAT. LEGISLATION THAT ENACT IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT ENACTED THE LEAD AGENCY STRUCTURE. INCLUDED A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE SPECIFIC METRICS THAT EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EACH OF THE ACTORS WITHIN THE SYSTEM. SO AS MISS CORTEZ MENTIONED THIS IS JUST THE FIRST YEAR THIS THE FINAL THIRD OF GROUP OF LEADS WERE SELECTED IN JANUARY. SO THAT PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING SORT OF WHAT THE RIGHT METRIC IS GIVENTHE DIFFERENT GROUPS FOCUS OF EACH LEAD IS GOING TO BE FINALIZED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR TO BE USED THROUGHOUT THE FIVE YEAR TERM OF THE GRANT -- BUT THE STATUTE ACTUALLY REQUIRED AT A MINIMUM THAT THE METRICS INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS WITHIN THE AREA THAT ARE BEING IDENTIFIED FOR SYSTEMS AND WHETHER THEY'RE IMPROVING. AS A ONE MEASURE BUT WITH THE GOAL IS TO HAVE MULTIPLE MEASURES THAT LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT ROLES AND FUNCTIONS THAT THESE LEAD AGENCIES HAVE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO KNOW. IF THE SCHOOLS ARE GOING FROM RED TO GREEN. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE OF A PROBLEM AT THE SCHOOL LEVEL. OR IT IS YOU INDICATED WHETHER IT'S A PROBLEM AT THE DISTRICT LEVEL OR THE COUNTY. OFFICE OF EDUCATION LEVEL IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IS THAT MONEY IS IT PEOPLE IS IT TECHNIQUE IS AND WHATEVER AND GOOD I LOOK FORWARD. TO SEEING THE METRICS AND ULTIMATELY IF I'M AROUND LONG ENOUGH SEEING A REPORT YES SIR THANK YOU I WAS JUST GONNA SAY BEFORE AGAIN TOM OR MOLINA AT JUST TO CLARIFY -- ASIDE FROM SCHOOLS HAVING DASHBOARDS DISTRICTS HAVE DASHBOARDS COUNTIES HAVE DASHBOARDS ARE AND WE HAVE STATE AVERAGES AS WELL SO -- EVERY EVERYONE IS BEING MEASURED AS WELL AS THREE THE SPECIFIC REPORTING THAT DAVID SAP WAS REFERRING. TO GOOD LUCK LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT. NEXT TIME YES AND SANTA MARLENA THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE WHEN OUR FOURTH YEAR AND EXISTENCE -- WHEN I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT IS ABOUT THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING IN PARTICULAR WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS CONVERSATION? THIS MORNING AROUND THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS ONE OF THE TWO HAND OUTS THAT WE PROVIDED. THE FIRST IS JUST A DIAGRAM THAT EXPLAINS THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEMS FOR ALMOST ON A LOT OF TIME ON THAT BECAUSE I COULD SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THAT BUT I I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOME BASIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THAT SYSTEM IS. IS REALLY BILL TO WORK IN A PARTICULAR YOU'LL NOTICE -- THAT THE ELEAZAR THE MIDDLE IN THE WAY THAT THIS IS BUILT IS THAT FIRST LAYER SUPPORT IS INTENDED TO BE THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE CANAL SOPHISTICATION GETS FUNDING. IN PARTICULAR TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEIR DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR THOSE. WHO IDENTIFIED IN THE DASHBOARD IS IN NEED OF SERVICE IN THAT SERVICES OFF ON IS NOW CONSIDERED DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS WE FOR THAT? TOPIC. WHAT THAT LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE IS? THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS. THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ON THE DASHBOARD FOR A PARTICULAR AREA THE THING MAY BE STRUGGLING AND COULD BE A SUBGROUP IT COULD BE AS THE SPECIFIC -- SUBJECT AREA THE COUNTY OFFICE GOES AND MEETS WITH THEM THEY TRY TO IDENTIFY WHAT OF WHAT THEY CONSIDER THE ROOT CAUSES. OF OF WHY STUDENTS MAY BE STRUGGLING AND THEN THEY HELP THEM DEVISE A NEW PLAN AND RESOURCES. TO HAVE WAYS TO GO AHEAD AND ATTACK THAT PROBLEM THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE TO THE SYSTEMS PIECE AND THEN WHEN THEY REVIEW THEIR EL CAP IN THE FOLLOWING. YEAR THAT THEY'VE THE HOLES WE PUT THOSE STRATEGIES INTO THAT AL CAPP IN THE CONTINUE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION. THE NEXT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IS THE GEOGRAPHICALLY AGENCIES. AND THESE ARE THE AGENCIES THAT WERE CHOSEN THIS YEAR -- JUST CHOSEN IN THE FALL. OUR AGENCY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AS WELL AS THE STATE BOARD OF ED STAFF -- WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHOOSING THOSE FOR READING THEM TOGETHER AND THEN MAKING THAT SELECTION THEY ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR A GROUP OF OTHER COUNTY OFFICES AROUND SOME GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES. AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY COUNTY OFFICE HAS THAT CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP THAT GIVE THAT ASSISTANCE TO A DISTRICT. THAT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY TO HELP BUILD THAT CAPACITY OR THE PROVIDE THAT RESOURCE SOME OTHER WAY -- THE THIS TO THEMSELVES OR SOME OTHER ANOTHER COUNTY OFFICE OR HE COULD BE TO THE C. C. AS WELL. THE NEXT ALL THE OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE ON THE EDGE OF THAT OUR OTHER LEAD AGENCIES SOME OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXISTENCE -- OTHER ONES ARE NEW THIS YEAR AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS A NEW INITIATIVE THE CELLPHONE RESOURCE LEADS ARE NEW THIS WELL SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS -- ARE ALSO KNEW SO THEY HAVE SPECIFIC SPECIALTIES WHERE THEY HAVE SHOULD THEY PROVEN THAT THEY HAVE SOME EXPERTISE IN A PARTICULAR AREA. SO THAT THE WAY I WAS REFERRED TO DO SO IF THERE'S A LOCAL AGENCY AGENCIES THERE'S A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAS A NEED. AND IS A COUNTY OFFICE GOES IN AND STARTS TO WORK WITH THEM AND DETERMINES THAT WHAT THEY NEED IS. THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY OF THESE GEOGRAPHIC LEADS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE EXPERTISE. ARE AND THEN BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTY OFFICE WOULD HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PROVIDE THAT EXPERTISE TO THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE OTHER PIECE TO IS TO MAKE SURE I KNOW I WAS JUST I WAS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT UP IN SHASTA. BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE ARE ONE OF THE BIGGER COUNTY OFFICE IN OUR REGION. AND SO WE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESOURCES AND SO WE HAD OTHER SOME OF OUR PARTNERS IN MODOC AND TWENTY WERE PRETTY SMALL SO. WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TO DO THIS WORK AROUND DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS WE DID QUITE A BIT OF WORK TO HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF RESOURCES? THAT WAS JUST BECAUSE WE HAD SOME PARTNERSHIPS IS AS COLLEAGUES THIS SYSTEM. SURE ISN'T THAT WILL HAPPEN AND THAT'S THE ONE THAT'S IN PARTICULAR THOSE GEOGRAPHICALLY AGENCIES ARE OUR ROLE WITHIN THAT WITH THE CD IN PARTICULAR IS SELL CORDONING FACILITATE THAT. SO WE HAD TO CHOOSE THOSE FOLKS WE HAVE TO BRING THOSE THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WORK WE HAVE TO HELP THEM -- TO SOME OF THE EVALUATION AROUND THAT WORK AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS. SO I CAN ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT SYSTEMS OR JUST LOOKING AT YOUR HAND -- I'M JUST CURIOUS MAYBE IT'S THIS WHOLE THING IS TO NEW BUT HOW MANY -- HOW-MANY ELEAZAR IN LEVEL THREE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS NONE? YES NONE AT THIS TIME SO THE THE LEVEL TWO IS WERE AROUND THE VERY FIRST WEEK AND MANY BECAUSE WERE AND AS YOU SAID IT'S REALLY IN THE SYSTEM SO WE ONLY HAVE TWO YEARS WORTH OF DATA. SO TO BE A LEVEL THREE THAT WOULD TAKE SOME TIME BE ABLE TO GET THERE. I GUESS THAT'S A GOOD THING THAT IS A GOOD THING. OKAY SO THE NEXT PIECE OF THOSE SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT IS -- OWN I'M SORRY SO THE OTHER HAND OUT TO THIS IS JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE THESE ARE THE LEAD AGENCIES SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE ANOTHER TIME. BUT THAT JUST SHOWS YOU WHO ARE THOSE COUNTY OFFICES IN THE OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE HAVE BEEN CHOSEN. AND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THEY DO ON THE VERY BACK [inaudible] TO GOOD. THE SECOND PIECE IS THE WORK AROUND IN PARTICULAR I'M A LOOK AT OUR PARTNERSHIP SO. WE WERE ASKED TO BRING TOGETHER VARIOUS -- DISTRICTS A DISTRICTS WERE AWESOME AND AND THOSE WHO AND MAYBE BEEN STRUGGLING ACADEMICALLY SO WE WE WERE ASKED TO DO SOME WORK WITH SOME PILOT DISTRICTS DISTRICTS. TO WHO EIGHTY NINETY STRUGGLING OR TRYING TO GET BETTER ACADEMICALLY SOME OF THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH ELEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BRINGING THEM TOGETHER AND REALLY TRYING TO HELP THEM. DEVELOP SOME STRATEGIES TO GET BETTER ACADEMICALLY SO AND AGAIN VERY MUCH LIKE -- THE DIFFERENCES ASSISTANCE SOME OF THEIR DASH DASH FOR RESULTS SO OUR WORK WITH THEM WILL FINISH THIS YEAR IT WAS FUNDED ARE FUNDING ENDS THIS YEAR. SO WE WILL HAVE A REPORT TO COME OUT IN THE FALL AND WILL HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD DATA TO BE ABLE TO SHOW SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WE MADE IN THOSE DISTRICTS. PART OF THE GOAL AROUND THAT WORK IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE EXAMPLES OF WHERE WE DONE THAT WORK TO WEAR AS DISTRICTS OTHER DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE MAYBE START TO HAVE SOME OF THE STRUGGLES. WILL HAVE A RESOURCE FOR SOME PRACTICES WERE WE CAN BE ABLE TO USE SOME OF THOSE SAME STRATEGIES TO HELP OTHER DISTRICTS. AB EIGHTEEN FORTY YOU IS A NEW BILL THAT WAS PASSED IN AUGUST AND SO THESE ARE THE DISTRICTS IN THE STATE WHO ARE IN RECEIVERSHIP WHICH RESERVE A STATE LOAN -- AND SO WITH THE EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN FORTY FOR THE FIRST TIME AND THERE'S THE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT WHEN A DISTRICTS IS IN RECEIVERSHIP TO THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE -- HAS AND HAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY GOING START WORKING WITH THEM ACADEMICALLY SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING THAT WORK -- SINCE SEPTEMBER IN PARTICULAR WITH THE INGLEWOOD AND VALLEJO CITY OF THE DISTRICTS WE'VE WORKED PRETTY STRONGLY AND WE WERE ALREADY IN THOSE DISTRICTS. A BASED ON IN INGLEWOOD THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT ASKED US TO GO IN THERE LAST SPRING. AND THEN AND THEN VALLEJO CITY THE ACTUALLY THE DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY SUPER **** TO COMMAND -- WE'RE JUST STARTING TO DO SOME WORK THE COUNTY OFFICE TO THEIR DIFFERENCES ASSISTANCE. AS WELL AND SO WE'RE DOING QUITE A BIT TO SPENDING QUITE A BIT OF TIME IN PUTTING A LOT OF RESOURCES. AND REALLY TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE. ARE -- ATTACKING THE ACADEMIC ISSUES WHAT WITH A FOUND IN THOSE DISTRICTS AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS IS WHEN THERE'S FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES STUDENTS DON'T DO AS WELL. AND SO THEY'VE SEEN OVER THE YEARS AT THE ANY DISTRICT IT'S EVER BEEN IN RECEIVERSHIP AS ACADEMIC ISSUES AS WELL SO EIGHTEEN FORTY RECOGNIZES THAT. SAID LET'S PUT CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE IN THERE SO WE CAN WHILE WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP THE DISTRICT FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO GET BETTER FINANCIALLY. WE CAN ALSO BE HELPING STUDENTS AT SAME TIME OFTEN THE PAST THE FOCUS IS BEEN SPECIFICALLY ON THE FINANCIAL ISSUES IN THE ACADEMIC ISSUES CONTINUE TO GET WORSE YES SO PERHAPS. PERHAPS YOU COULD NOT TO BELABOR THIS BECAUSE WE CAN DO IT SOME OTHER TIME BUT CAN YOU ENLIGHTEN ME WHY IS THAT. FOR EXAMPLE IN A DISTRICT IT'S IN RECEIVERSHIP -- SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT SOME OF THEM WERE IN RECEIVERSHIP BECAUSE OF THE IMHO USE THAT WERE NEGOTIATED IN THE SALARY AND BENEFIT PACKAGES THAT WERE PAID. TO A VARIETY OF FOLKS FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM. OTHERS CAN HAVE THAT DEBATE BUT TEACHERS ARE BEING PAID. IN THE CLASSROOM. EDUCATING STUDENTS HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE WHY THERE IS A DROP IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I UNDERSTAND THE DROP IN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOW THAT'S WHETHER SHE WISHES. BUT IS THERE IS THERE A DIRECT CONNECTION. AND HOW DOES THAT WORK THERE IS IN EVERY EVERY JUST BECAUSE THIS IS DIFFERENT THERE ARE SOME COMMONALITIES IN PARTICULAR WITH THESE DISTRICTS. MOST EARN I HAVE HAD SEVERE DECLINING ENROLLMENT INGLEWOOD FOR EXAMPLE IS LOST OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS LIKE EIGHT YEARS SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETIMES OVER A THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO YEAR. SO THEY'RE HAVING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS QUICKLY AND THEY'RE IN THERE OFTEN REDUCING THINGS WITHOUT. BEING ABLE TO GET SOME REAL CONSIDERATION TO MAKE SURE THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO REDUCE AND SO OFTEN THAT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS WE'RE GOING IN AND DOING THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS. IS THERE THERE MAY BE SOME GOOD PRACTICES ARE SOME GOOD THINGS HAPPENING THEY MAY HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL COACH IS WHAT HAVE YOU BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A REALLY STRONG DATA SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE. SO OFTEN THE REDUCTIONS THAT THEY'RE MAKING AS TO WHAT THOSE THINGS ARE IN SOME OF THOSE REDUCTIONS. COULD BE KEY TO THE SUCCESS THEY'VE HAD IN THE PAST. IN SO THE SOMETIMES REDUCING THE WRONG THINGS -- AND SO THERE THE END I THINK IT'S BECAUSE I HAVEN'T RESPOND VERY QUICKLY HE ALSO THE TURNOVERS SIGNIFICANT. IN THE WOULD FOR EXAMPLE IS THEIR CABINET LEVEL TEAM RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS THE SAME PEOPLE THAT THE TABLE. THIS GOING TO TURN OVER PEOPLE LEAVE AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT THERE'S THERE'S A CREDIBLE MODERN -- IN COHERENCE IF YOU WILL THAT EXIST -- SO OVER FINDING IS WE'RE GOING IN THERE IS THAT OFTEN THERE MAY BE. SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME GOOD THINGS HAPPENING BUT IT'S NOT SYSTEM ACROSS THE DISTRICT SIGN HAPPENING IN EVERY SCHOOL WILL GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE MAY SEE MORE OF THESE. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE LIVING IN. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT. EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PRESSURES AND DIFFERENT. ISSUES DO YOU THINK WE WILL. NEVERTHELESS BE ABLE -- WITH YOUR INVOLVEMENT -- YOUR ENTITIES INVOLVEMENT DEVELOP SORT OF A TEMPLATE FOR HOW. SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD RESPOND. THE FINANCIAL ISSUES WILL BE HANDLED BY SOMEBODY ELSE BUT HAVE THE DISTRICT SHOULD BE RID SHOULD RESPOND UNDER THESE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES FROM AN ACADEMIC. STANDPOINT YES IN OTHER WORDS GENERALLY YOU SHOULDN'T REDUCE HERE THIS IS WHAT I NEED TO DO AND SORT OF A CHECKLIST FOR SUPERINTENDENTS AS THEY AS THEY MOVE OR THE OR THE RECEIVER -- AS THEY MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO TRY TO RESTORE FINANCIAL VIABILITY TO THE DISTRICT YES SIR TWO EXAMPLES OF THAT ONE IS I MENTION THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS. OR FINDING IS WERE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACADEMIC REVIEWS THAT WE'RE DOING THE ANY JUST TO COULD DO SO SCHOOLS. RIGHT AND THAT OUR GOAL WOULD BE IS TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH COUNTY OFFICES TO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT. TO YOUR IN RECEIVERSHIP RIGHT NOW THE COUNTY OFFICES I GUESS A IS A COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT I KNEW WHICH MY DISTRICT ARE DOING BETTER THAN OTHERS. I HAD SOME SENSE LOCALLY OF SO WE THINK THAT TOOL CAN ACTUALLY BE VERY HELPFUL TO GO IN AND MAKE SURE BECAUSE IT LOOKS -- IT IT IDENTIFIES WHAT ARE SOME KEY THINGS YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR MAKE SURE THE STUDENTS ARE DOING WELL ACADEMICALLY. AND WE'RE GOING TO MEASURE THOSE KEY AREAS AND WE LOOK TO SEE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AS WELL IN THIS AREA THEY'RE DOING FAIRLY WELL IN THIS SERIOUS EACH WEEK THIS DID THIS OR DID THIS MORE CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE DISTRICTS SO THEY HAVE SOMETHING THEY CAN LOOK AT TO GO. AHEAD AND ATTACK THE PROBLEM NOW. SO THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OF THE OF THE PIECE THAT WORD WITH A COLD -- REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THE OTHER PIECE OF GIVING EXAMPLES SOME OF OUR INITIAL WORK IN OAKLAND. THIS KIND OF VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU WERE SUGGESTING OAKLAND IS HAVING TO MAKE SEVERE REDUCTIONS RIGHT NOW THEY'RE HAVING THE CUT. MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WHICH MEANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CUT INSTRUCTIONAL PROGRAM TOO SO ONE OF THE THINGS OAKLAND **** TO DO AND THEN AND THEN ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT SAID. IS COULD YOU SIT WITH US COULD YOU LOOK AT OUR EL CAP COULD YOU LOOK AT OUR RESULTS COULD YOU LOOK AT THE AREAS IN THERE THAT YOU THINK -- ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE TO BE ABLE TO HELP STUDENTS. AND SO WITH US TO LOOK AT WORD OVER SUGGESTING WE WOULD REDUCE AND THEN LOOK AT IS THAT THE RIGHT THING TO REDUCE. RIGHT IF WE REDUCE THAT SHOULD BE REDUCES INSTEAD BECAUSE IT'S A KEY AREA THAT'S LISTEN ARE EL CAP AND THEN HELP US AS WE DESIRE -- KEPT GOING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE KEY AREAS OF THEIR SO SIMILAR THOUGHT PARTNER RIGHT TO BEING ABLE THOUGHTFUL DECISION WHEN THEY'RE SITTING THERE TO MAKE THE CUTS SO JUST TRYING TO DO IT ON THEIR OWN. AND SO HOW DO YOU DISTILL ALL THIS AND AND THEN DISSEMINATED PUSH IT PUSH IT OUT AS OPPOSED TO SIMPLY POSTED ON A WEBSITE. PUSH IT OUT AS BEST PRACTICES -- TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION STATEWIDE EVERY WEEK. IN THE ACT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THE MILITARY BUT HERE IN THE WAY BACK -- THERE WAS A LOT OF CROSS FEET I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IN THOSE DAYS OF BEST PRACTICES FROM BASE TO BASE FROM UNIT TO UNIT FROM COMMANDED COMMAND SO. IF I WAS ON THE WEST COAST I COULD SEE WHAT SOME COMMAND ON THE EAST COAST. WAS DOING IN VARIOUS AREAS AND pAND WHAT. THIS ESSENTIALLY WAS A BEST PRACTICE AND I COULD DECIDE WHETHER IT FIT MY PARTICULAR SITUATION OR NOT AND THEN IMPLEMENT. IT DO YOU PUSH THIS INFORMATION OUT IN A IN A IN A FORM THAT'S DISTILLED SO SOMEONE CAN. UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AND DECIDE WHETHER IT APPLIES. YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I WILL TELL YOU THE THE KEY TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I REALLY BELIEVE IS ON THE OF THIS BILL SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. THE SYSTEM WAS FORTY REALLY BILL. TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO THEY'RE NO LONGER WORK IN ISOLATION RIGHT IN THE KEY PIECE TO THAT IS COUNTY OFFICES. SO FOR US IN PARTICULAR OUR WORK IS. THE MORE THAT WE CAN WORK COLLECTIVELY WOULD COUNTY OFFICE WHO CAN THEN USE THOSE SAME RESOURCES TO GET INTO DISTRICTS WITHIN THEIR COUNTY THERE'S THERE'S THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER CHANCE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND UP HERE OUT IN OUR OWN TRYING TO GET INTO A DISTRICT SO I REALLY THINK THE SYSTEM IS SET UP FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. IN PARTICULAR THAT WE'RE IN AND IT'S I THINK IT'S JUDY THAT US WITH THE CD ARE ARE BEING ASKED TO BE WITH THEM TO HELP FACILITATE THAT SO. NOT ONLY ARE WE A FACILITATOR BUT WE HAVE RESOURCES AT THE SAME TIME WERE IN SOME SENSE COULD BE A LEAD. YOU KNOW AND SOME OF THIS WORK AROUND SYSTEMIC. SO PERIODICALLY AS PART OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT IN YOUR ROLE IN IT YOU DO IN FACT PUSH OUT -- INNOCENT SURELY DO LESSONS FOR SUCCESS WE DO A NEEDS THE EXAMPLE OF THAT IS TO IF YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER. SIDE OF THAT PIECE OF PAPER WE WE DO THESE P. L. AND NETWORKS WHICH ARE. WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE OF THEM WHICH ARE BASICALLY GROUPS OF FOLKS WITH COUNTY OFFICES IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO COME TOGETHER -- TRYING TO ATTACK A SPECIFIC PROBLEM WE LEAVE THAT WORK WITH THEM IN ADDITION WE'RE DEVELOPING WHAT WE CALL THESE TOOLKITS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THOSE SUBJECT AREAS. THAT ARE LISTED THERE ONE FOR EXAMPLE IS AROUND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING WE'VE SOME BEST RESOURCES THAT FOLKS COULD BE ABLE TO USE OUR FREE. THE DISTRICT PARTICIPATED SAY HERE ARE SOME RESOURCES YOU CAN CONSIDER USING AROUND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND COUNTY OFFICES ARE HELPING US DETERMINE THOSE AS WELL AS WE USE IN THE DASH FOR RESULTS. THE CHARTER THE TERM IN ONE OF THOSE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD TO PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF SOME BEST PRACTICES. PERFECT. THANK YOU SIR YOU'RE WELCOME WHO'S NEXT. THE MORNING GIVE SEPARATE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AGAIN I'M JUST GONNA I THINK CLOSE THE UPDATE PART OF THIS BY TALKING ABOUT SORT OF HOW THESE PIECES FIT TOGETHER AND THE ONGOING WORK TO UPDATE IMPROVE THE SYSTEM AS WE GO -- AS MISS COURT HAS MENTIONED THAT -- I'LL SEE IF I WAS PASSED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND WE'RE NOW SIX YEARS THEN AND THERE WAS ACTUALLY A VERY INTENTIONAL STAGED IMPLEMENTATION BUILT INTO THE STATUTE. THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS THAT YOU'VE HEARD REFERENCE THE STATE BOARD WAS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE TEMPLATE FOR THOSE PLANS AND JANET BY JANUARY OF% TWENTY FOURTEEN SO THERE'S BEEN THEIR OFFICIALLY THREE YEARS OF LOCAL PLANNING WITHOUT THE EXISTENCE OF THE DASHBOARD OR THE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE MISTER ON MOLINA. DESCRIBED IN THROUGH THAT -- THAT THE BOARD DIG THE BOARD WAS CHARGED WITH ADOPTING THE TEMPLATE FOR THOSE PLANS IS THAT WHEN THE DASHBOARD WAS RELEASED THE BOARD UPDATED THE TEMPLATE TO ENSURE THAT THE CONNECTION AND LINKAGE BETWEEN THOSE TO SET THE EXPECTATION ALL LONG. WAYS THAT THE LOCAL PLAN WOULD BE INFORMED BY STATE LEVEL DATA RELATIVE TO SOME OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. AND IS MISS CORTEZ MENTIONED THERE TWENTY ONE MEASURES THAT HAVE TO BE TRACKED IN THIS LOCAL PLANS. HOW DO WE IDENTIFY A SUBSET OF THOSE OF THOSE YOU KNOW KEY CRITICAL MEASURES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS? AND AT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP INFORM AND STRENGTH AND THE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS FOR DISTRICTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO PRIORITIZE THE USE OF THEIR RESOURCES. SO THE CURRENT TEMPLATE FOR THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLANS REQUIRES DISTRICTS IF THEY HAVE A A RED OR AN ORANGISH FOR THE TWO LOWEST PERFORMANCE LEVELS ON ANY OF THE INDICATORS IN THE DASHBOARD. THE RECORD TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING ABOUT THAT PERFORMANCE IN ADDITION THERE ALSO REQUIRED TO ADDRESS ANY AREA WHERE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PERFORMANCE ON THOSE INDICATORS BETWEEN STUDENT GROUPS. SO AT THE CORE OF THIS IS REALLY FOCUSING ON ADDRESSING INEQUITIES INCLUDE IN IT DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE TRYING TO PROMOTE EQUITY AND THAT LOCAL CONVERSATION. NOW IS A PART OF LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE. DISTRICTS REQUIRED TO ADDRESS ANY AREA WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG STUDENT GROUPS. THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WHEN THE LAW WAS PASSED THESE PIECES WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO OPERATE AS A SYSTEM F ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE SYSTEM. THEY WERE ROLLED OUT SORT OF INDIVIDUALLY BUT NOW WE'RE IN A PLACE THAT ALL THE PIECES ARE IN PLACE OF GOING BACK AND UPDATING AND IMPROVING THOSE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE MUTUALLY REINFORCING KEY QUESTION LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY CONTEXT. IS WERE PUSHING DECISION MAKING DOWN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE KNOW THEIR CONTACTS AND KNOW WHAT WORKED BEST FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES. BUT IT'S ALSO HELPING THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS AND IF NECESSARY THE HARD CONVERSATIONS. ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS IN CLASSROOMS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES. SO WHERE TO PLACE NOW AS WE MOVE FORWARD IMPLEMENTATION WE WE WE WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE WE WILL LEARN. IN THE SYSTEM A SUPPORT WE WILL LEARN AS DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO USE THE DASHBOARD. AND WE WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO ADJUST AND ADAPT TO ENSURE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL IN CONVERSATION WITH LEGISLATORS AND OTHERS HOW ARE WE RESPONDING IN ENSURING THE STATE POLICY IS ALIGNED TO PROMOTING THAT GOAL THAT WE HAVE. WHICH IS IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THAT HAVE AN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS LET ME. THIS IS A LITTLE BIT. TO BE A LITTLE BIT OFF TRACK BUT I HOPE NOT SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE L. CAP. NO ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS OF IS LOCAL FUNDING FOR A SCHOOL COUNSELORS -- PSYCHOLOGISTS IN SOME CASES NURSES -- IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE EL CAP PROCESS TODAY WITHIN THE A PRIORITIES IN PARTICULAR SCHOOL CLIMATE. THAT REQUIRES THE DISTRICTS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OTHER STAKEHOLDERS PARENTS TEACHERS. A CLASSIFIED WHATEVER. ABOUT THE PRESENCE OR LACK OF PRESENCE. AND NUMBERS AND LOCATIONS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS COUNSELORS AND NURSES. I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES IT AND I'M WONDERING IF I'VE MISSED SOMETHING SO THAT. THAT. ESSENTIALLY THE NUMBER PURSUE A SUPPORT PERSONNEL IN PLATE IS NOT A METRIC THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE TWENTY ONE REQUIRED METRICS BECAUSE IT DIRECTLY RELATES I WOULD THINK. TO SCHOOL CLIMATE AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS ON THE KEYON CAMPUSES RIGHT I I THINK WHAT WHAT I WHAT I CAN SHARE IS IT'S IT'S NOT THAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. IN THIS PARTICULAR POSITIONS BUT IT IS CERTAINLY AS AS YOU AS YOU NOTED. CENTER OFF IT IS SOMETHING WHERE. IF YOU TALK ABOUT CLIMATE HERE HI CHRONIC ABSENCE RATES IF YOU HAVE HIGH SUSPENSION RATES IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL CLIMATE SURVEY THAT SHOWS THAT A LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T FEEL THERE'S AN ADULT THAT CARES ABOUT THEM. THAT'S ONE OF THE REQUIRED IN A MEASURES TO BE LOOKING AT THAT THOSE ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT'S THE ACTION THAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE TO TRY TO ADDRESS AND IMPROVE. PERFORMANCE ON THAT METRIC AND I CAN ALL CAPS WE ARE SEEING THAT THAT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CHOICES. THAT DISTRICTS ARE MAKING IN CONSULTATION WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT HOW TO PRIORITIZE THEIR RESOURCES AS A WAY TO ADVANCE THE GOAL IS TO YOU -- IT YOU KNOW MAKE SOME ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORT PERSONNEL COUNSELORS NURSES IT'S BETTER. WELL GIVEN THE WHAT I UNDERSTAND TO BE THE LEVEL OF STRESS. IN ACADEMIA THESE DAYS -- WHICH I WOULD ASSUME IS PROBABLY ALWAYS BEEN THERE AND HIGHER EDUCATION AT LEAST IT WAS WHEN I WAS A STUDENTS PROBABLY EXACERBATED -- TOOL -- GREAT EXTENT TODAY. I UNDERSTAND THAT STRESS. TODAY. EXTENDS NOT ONLY. IN THE NINE THROUGH TWELVE BUT RIGHT DOWN INTO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND JUST MY PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THIS -- I'M NOT ADVOCATING TO ADD ANOTHER PRIORITY TO THE LOCAL CONTROL. CATEGORY PLANNING PROCESS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME WITHIN THE EXISTING ARCHITECTURE AND THE EIGHT PRIORITIES. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO REQUIRE. DISTRICTS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PARENTS AND TEACHERS. ABOUT. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF STUDENTS ON THE CAMPUSES IN THE AND WHETHER OR NOT ADDITIONAL. MENTAL HEALTH AND RELATED. PROVIDERS NEED TO BE FUNDED OUT OF THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING MONEY THAT MOVES DOWN THE PIPELINE. AND IF IN DOING SO AND IF IN HAVING THAT CONVERSATION. ADDITIONAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS ARE IDENTIFIED THEN THAT WOULD INFORM FOLKS. WHEN THEY COME UP HERE? AS TO WHATTHEY NEED TO BE ASKING US. FOR BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY NO HIGHER PRIORITY AMONG MY COLLEAGUES ALTHOUGH I HAVEN'T TAKEN A WHOLE. THEN THE THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. OF STUDENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES AT ALL LEVELS. AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. THE L. CAPS SO I'M I'M I'D ASK YOU MEAN I'M. IDEAS THAT YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND SEE IF WE'VE WE'VE DONE ENOUGH. BECAUSE IF IF THE LANGUAGE IS VAGUE. THEN IT'S AN AND THE PARENTS ARE. FOR SOME REASON KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT IT OR AREN'T FORCEFUL ABOUT IT. THEN IT SEMS TO ME AS PART OF THE PLANNING PROCESS WE COULD HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE SUBJECT IS NEVER DISCUSSED. AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO ME -- HOPEFULLY IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THE FIRST FLOOR. SO THIS IS MY COMMENT OTHER THAN THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS CENTER MARONEY QUESTIONS QUESTIONS. YOU'VE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB ALL OF THE PANELISTS AND ALL OF THE ALL I THOUGHT HE WAS CLOSING AYE THANKS SORRY. YOUR YOUR THE CLOSER. DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE INCREASED ROLE OF ACCOUNTABILITY IN CALIFORNIA EDUCATION -- WITH THE BUDGET FLEXIBILITY THAT THE LOCAL CONTROL OR THAT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES HAVE UNDER THE NOW FULLY IMPLEMENTED LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. TO THE AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND ACCOMPANYING TRAILER BILL. CONTAINS SEVERAL PROPOSALS TO HELP STRENGTHEN THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND OPEN PROVE OUTCOMES FOR ALL STUDENTS. THE FIRST IS THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS ONE TIME FUND. TO SUPPORT THE ALIGNMENT AND INTEGRATION OF ONLINE PLATFORM SUPPORTING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD. THE LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY. PLAN ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE SYSTEM. AND THE SCHOOL ACCOUNTABILITY REPORT CARDS. SIMILAR TO PASS PROPOSALS THIS FUNDING WILL BE PROVIDED TO THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. WHO IS THE CONTRACTOR FOR ALL THREE SYSTEMS? IN A GREAT INTEGRATING THESE. SYSTEMS INTO A SINGLE WEB BASED APPLICATION MY HOPE INCREASING GAUGE WITH BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND EA'S BY ALLOWING THE PUBLIC ACCESS SINGLE PLATFORM FOR THIS INFORMATION. STREAMLINING THE SYSTEMS AND ELIMINATING DUPLICATIVE AN OUTDATED INFORMATION. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. TO MAKE PERMANENT TO POSITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THERE WAS SUPPORT THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL DASHBOARD TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZED SIGNIFICANT ROLE THAT THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. PLAY WITHIN THE SYSTEM WIDE -- THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. IN ORDER TO ALIGN WITH THE EXPECTED WORKLOAD AND THE COLLABORATIVE. AND FOR THE SUPPORT ITS MISSION OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO L. EA IS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE CUP CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL XCELLENCE. I TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. BRING ITS TOTAL ALLOCATION TO ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TASKING THE COLLABORATIVE WITH. THE ROLE OF A SO IT IN THE COORDINATION OF ACTIVITIES BEING UNDERTAKEN. BY THE VARIOUS ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE STATE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES TWENTY POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. SUPPORT A DISTRICTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DIFFERENTIATED ASSISTANCE. FOR A TOTAL OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THIS IS AN INCREASE FROM SIXTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROVIDING THE CURRENT YEAR. FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. ADDITIONALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS IDENTIFIED FOR CONFERENCE OF SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT UNDER THE EVERY STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT LIKELY CHANGE DURING THE SPRING PROCESS. TO REFLECT UPDATED FEDERAL GRANT INFORMATION ONLY. THE BUDGET INCLUDES SEVERAL TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS INTO PROVIDING MORE PAIR PARITY -- BETWEEN THE EL CAP DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SPECIFICALLY THE LANGUAGE SPECIFIES THE CHARTER SCHOOL SHOULD BE ADDRESSING STATE PARTIES TO THE RAIN. THEY'RE ALL CAPS ADOPTING THEIR CAPS AT A PUBLIC HEARING. PROMINENTLY POSTING THEIR CAPS ON THEIR WEBSITES. INTRANSITIVE REPORTS IN NOTICES IF 15% OF OR MORE OF THEIR STUDENTS ENROLLED SPEAKER PRIMARY LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH. THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS PLACED ON TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IT WILL BRING MORE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO TURN OPERATIONS. WITH THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS YEAH. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME I'VE SEEN ANYTHING HAVING TO DO WITH SOFTWARE AND ONLINE PLATFORM IT'S THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS -- GOOD FOR YOU IS OUT OF MONEY -- WE BELIEVE THAT SUFFICIENT ONE TIME MONEY TO COVER THE THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE SYSTEMS ARE THERE ON ONGOING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE WILL BE ONGOING COSTS HOWEVER THE THE WE HAVE A FORMAL ESTIMATE FOR WHAT THOSE ONGOING COSTS WILL BE. SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE PROVIDING THE ONE TIME COST TO HELP ONLINE YOU SYSTEMS AND AS WE HAVE A BETTER ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE ON GOING COSTA RICA FOR THE CONVERSATIONS TOMORROW. IT IS A GOOD JOB [inaudible] FOR I CLOSE UP THANK YOU ALL ANYBODY ELSE. EVERYBODY SAID EVERYTHING I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WAS AN EXCELLENT PANEL I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. NOW LET'S. TURN IT OVER TO PUBLIC COMMENT ROTH CENTER MORALE AND STAFF JEFF BARKER REPRESENTING THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS. I YOU'VE COVERED A LOT OF VERY IN DEPTH AND COMPLICATED ISSUES TODAY -- JUST LEAVE YOU WITH SOME QUICK COMMENTS. A ONE WITH RESPECT TO LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THAT WERE VERY HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS MAINTAINING THE COMMITMENT TO THE LCF APPROACH. I'M. QUITE SURE THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS YEAR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME PRESSURES. A TO A TINKER WITH THE LC FF PERHAPS CREATE CARVE OUTS WITHIN THE LCF HALF. OF ALL WELL MEANING EFFORTS -- WE WOULD URGE OR ENCOURAGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO A STAY THE COURSE THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS JUST RECENTLY APPROVED. A AUDIT OF L. CFF AUDIT. I WILL PERHAPS SET THE STAGE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF LCF HALF. OF THAT I'M SURE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE INTERESTED IN DOING AT SOME POINT. WITH REGARD TO THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. OF WE CERTAINLY DO A SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL -- FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION PLAY IN THAT SYSTEM -- GREAT CONVERSATION BY THE PANEL OF THERE'S A LOT OF GREAT WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL A FOR EXAMPLE JUST YESTERDAY AND RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE COUNTY OFFICE STAFF JOINED BY C. C. E.. N. C. D. AHEAD OF WILL DAY LONG MEETING AS PART OF THIS ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS. TO WORK WITH OUR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED FOR DIFFERENTIATED SUPPORT. A TO REALLY DIG DOWN DEEP. AND TO DETERMINE WHAT LEVELS OF SUPPORT DO WE NEEDTO PROVIDE IN ORDER TO IF THEY'RE NOT SHOWING ADEQUATE PROGRESS ON THE DASHBOARD. TO TURN THAT AROUND. AND THEN LASTLY SENATOR ROTH WITH RESPECT TO YOUR COMMENT ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT OF ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY ARE -- IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF THEIR THINKING A TO GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. LAST YEAR SANTA CENTER. WHEN YOU HAVE A ATTEMPTED SUICIDE BY A THIRD GRADER THAT TENDS? TO MAKE YOU STAND UP AND TAKE NOTICE WIND UP THERE EL CAP. AND DAY COMPLETELY RE DID A SECTION TO DEVELOP -- DISTRICT WIDE STRATEGY AND STRIKE FORCE IF YOU WILL A TO REALLY BEGAN. TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. NOW OF COURSE THE QUESTION IS WHEN YOU DO THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU CAN'T DO -- SO THAT GET TAKES US BACK TO THE LEVEL OF FUNDING AND NOW WE KNOW THERE WILL NEVER BE ENOUGH TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT TO DO. ABOUT WE WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE. YOU TO A MAINTAIN THAT COMMITMENT TO PROP NINETY EIGHT AND TO HELP US. FIGURE OUT WAYS TO BE MORE EFFICIENT WITHIN PROP.

THREE WE WRITE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU CONSIDER ALLOCATING FIVE MILLION TO THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WHICH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS THE STATE'S TITLE THREE LEAD AGENCY FOR ENGLISH LEARNERS. AS A LEAD AGENCY THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO REGIONAL TITLE THREE LEADS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

CLIENT AREAS WE DO HAVE SOME DISTRICTS THAT ARE GROWING IN FACT THE WILD IN ROMAN ACROSS THE STATE IS DECLINING. WE HAVE SOME DISTRICTS SPECIALLY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN SUBURBAN DISTRICTS WHETHER IN CONTINUING TO GROW SO. JUST BRINGS A DIFFERENT DYNAMIC. YOUR POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN ON SHARING BEST PRACTICES IS SOMETHING ALL OF THEM WANT YOU REALLY HIT THE POINT HOW CAN THEY ACCESS AND LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.

THIS CENTER ROTH US SENATOR OF MORALE MICHAEL HOLE SIZE ARE HERE. SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE FORTY SEVEN SCHOOLDISTRICTS IN KERN COUNTY -- WE SERVE ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN MY COMMENTS REALLY REFLECT THE CONSENSUS RECOMMENDATIONS OF ALL OF THOSE DISTRICTS. HAVE HANDED OUT TO YOU THEREFORE DECENT TWO OF THE MORE INTERESTING TODAY'S HEARING. SOFT SPEAK TO THOSE AND BE VERY BRIEF. THE FIRST IS THE BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE IN THE COUNTY IS CONSISTENT WITH STATEWIDE RESEARCH NOW. SUCCESSFUL IN THERE FOR THE PRIORITIZE CELL CFF FUNDING AND COOL ON THE LC OF PFAFF WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE. A VERY LIMITED RESOURCE YEAR WE MAY EVEN BE LOOKING AS THE LA -- POINTED OUT EARLIER AT DECLINING REVENUE BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY SO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO GIVE US ORDER REFER TO USE THAT TO GIVE OUR PRIORITIES. RATHER THAN ALL OF THE MENU OF THINGS WE WANT WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. SECONDLY BECAUSE THE LCF HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. WE BELIEVE THAT NOT SO MUCH THAT YOU NEED TO PUT MONEY INTO EXPANDING THE LCF THIS YEAR BUT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT AB THIRTY NINE MISTER MERRETT SU CHI'S BILL. THAT WOULD SET NEW ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS WE BELIEVE FOR THE L. CFF BASED ON ITS SUCCESS -- I'VE HANDED OUT TO YOU IN ADDITION TO THOSE PRIORITIES A SUMMARY OF THE THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR COUNTY. THAT'S CURRENTLY GENERATED BY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS WHO ARE EITHER POOR. ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOSTER YOUTH IT'S ABOUT 72% OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION WE REALLY REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE STATE. THIS DATA SHOWS FIVE BASIC WE WE'VE ANALYZE THE DATA AND THE SPENDING OF THOSE OF THOSE DISTRICTS -- THERE'S FIVE BASIC AREAS WHERE THE DISTRICTS SPEND MOST OF THEIR MONEY. THE POINT IS THE WITHIN THOSE FIVE AREAS THEY'RE VERY DIVERSE AND VERY DIFFERENT IN WHAT THEY TARGET. THERE EL CAPS ARE DRIVEN IS MISTER SAP POINTED OUT TO YOU BY THE STATEWIDE PRIORITIES AND THE NEED TO TARGET OUR HIGH NEED STUDENTS AND THEY'RE DOING THAT. AND WE HAVE SUCCESS ON THAT WHICH TODAY'S HEARING DOESN'T HAVE TIME FOR ME TO GET INTO BUT MY POINT IS IS THEY'RE DOING IT IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS -- THEY'RE SPENDING THEIR TARGETING ONE EXAMPLE THE KERN HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE LARGEST HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. THERE SPENDING ALMOST 15% OF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL IN CONCENTRATION MONEY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. ON CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION BECAUSE THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR ANALYSIS OF THEIR STUDENTS. IS THAT INVESTING IN CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION IS THE BEST WAY TO DECREASE -- EXPULSION RATES INCREASE GRADUATION RATES IMPROVE ACHIEVEMENT ON THE PART OF THEIR TARGETED STUDENT POPULATION. THAT'S NOT TRUE OF ALL UNIFIED DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OR EVEN ALL DISTRICTS IN OUR COUNTY. BUT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO THAT WITHIN THE L. CFF BEING DRIVEN BY STATE WHY PRIORITIES THAT MR SAP -- REFERENCE TO YOU SO WE THINK THE LCF IS A SUCCESS STORY AND WE WE HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT IT THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT. IN THE GARAGE WITH THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN NOW ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH THE PRIOR SPEAKER IN RELATION TO INCREASING IN MAKING INVESTMENTS IN LCF -- FIVE WE WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT IS AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF MR MYERS TO CHEESE SB THIRTY NINE PROPOSAL -- WE ALSO SUPPORT THE DIRECTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL INCLUDING THE CREATION OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION. CONCENTRATION GRANT -- I KNOW IT WAS IN A TOPIC IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT IT'S AS FAR AS SPECIAL EDUCATION WE WOULD ENCOURAGE LOOKING AT IT. OFF FROM THE LAND AS WHETHER THE FUNDING IS TARGETED IT'S A NEED BASED. I AND IS THERE A CORRELATION TO STUDENT I IN TERMS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION. AND FINALLY -- SINCE THE CONVERSATION ABOUT -- EIGHTY EIGHTY FUNDING SYSTEM CAME OUT VERSUS AN ENROLLMENT I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT -- LAUSD CERTAINLY WELCOMES HAVING THAT CONVERSATION AND AND LOOKING AT THAT -- SYSTEM AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS THANK YOU.
