00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.053
TO SPEND THE MONEY WE ALREADY

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.188
GAVE YOU.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:44.823
THROUGH TO THE END OF NINETEEN

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.724
TWENTY WHY SHOULD WE GIVE YOU

00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:48.894
ANOTHER. THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE

00:13:48.961 --> 00:13:50.896
MILLION CERTAINLY BUT THERE MAY

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:52.498
BE SOME JUSTIFICATION FOR A

00:13:52.565 --> 00:13:54.533
PORTION OF THAT.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.235
BUT IT'S HARD.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:13:57.603
TO JUSTIFY THE OTHER BUT I

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:58.904
JUMPED IN I DON'T WANT THE

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:00.839
ANSWER THAT FIRST I WANT TO

00:14:00.906 --> 00:14:02.975
FIRST GET THE BOTTOM OF WHY.

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.076
GOVERNOR SUMMARY IS ONE THING B.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.246
C. P. IS ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OF

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.081
FINANCE.

00:14:09.148 --> 00:14:09.848
ERIN EDWARDS WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:11.350
OF FINANCE -- I UNDERSTAND THERE

00:14:11.417 --> 00:14:12.818
MAY BE SOME CONFUSION BETWEEN

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:13.686
WHAT WAS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:15.187
BUDGET AND THE AND THE B. C. P.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:16.355
AND I CERTAINLY.

00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.656
DON'T THINK THE INTENT WAS TO

00:14:17.723 --> 00:14:18.557
HOW TO HIDE THE BALL ABOUT

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:19.758
HOWARD INTENDING TO SPEND THE

00:14:19.825 --> 00:14:21.694
MORNING AND MISTER NECESSARILY

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.262
CALLING IT A HIDE THE BALL I'M

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:25.598
JUST CALL LET'S RECONCILE SURE

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:26.865
BUDGET OF MY HEARING.

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:30.769
SURE AND I I THINK THE THE

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:31.604
INTENT OF THE STATEMENT IN THE

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:32.771
GOVERNOR'S BDGET WAS TO

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.306
INDICATE THAT THE GOVERNOR FULLY

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:36.742
SUPPORTS -- EXPANDING DE

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:38.711
ESCALATION MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS

00:14:38.777 --> 00:14:41.880
INTERVENTION TRAINING -- I THINK

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.449
THE LEGEND HE APPRECIATES THE

00:14:43.515 --> 00:14:45.317
LEGISLATURE'S LEADERSHIP ON

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:46.452
PROVIDING THAT FUNDING IN THE

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:48.420
BUDGET LAST YEAR AND I THINK

00:14:48.487 --> 00:14:49.555
SHARES THE COMMITMENT TO

00:14:49.622 --> 00:14:51.056
FURTHERING THOSE GOALS AND I

00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:53.392
THINK -- THERE WAS NEVER AN AND

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:55.661
TIMES THAT W WOULD SIMPLY RE

00:14:55.728 --> 00:14:57.329
FIND THE SAME THINGS THAT WERE

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:59.598
FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS -- IN

00:14:59.665 --> 00:15:01.233
THE CURRENT YEAR MANY OF THOSE

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.901
THINGS LIKE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.203
AND DEVELOPMENT OF CURRICULUM

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.304
AREN'T REALLY THINGS THAT YOU

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.972
WOULD NECESSARILY DO OVER AND

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.040
OVER AGAIN.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:09.742
AND SO I THINK THE IDEA FROM THE

00:15:09.808 --> 00:15:11.644
BEGINNING WAS THAT THE

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.846
AUGMENTATION ON AN ONGOING BASIS

00:15:13.912 --> 00:15:16.148
WOULD BE USED -- TO DO SOME OF

00:15:16.215 --> 00:15:17.182
THE THINGS THAT MISTER ALVAREZ

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:19.118
SPOKE TO ABOUT REALLY

00:15:19.184 --> 00:15:20.619
INTEGRATING.

00:15:20.686 --> 00:15:22.021
THE MENTAL HEALTH AND CRISIS

00:15:22.087 --> 00:15:23.222
INTERVENTION TRAINING AND DE

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:25.424
ESCALATION TRAINING INTO THE THE

00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:27.426
FULL SPECTRUM OF TRAINING THAT

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.828
THE THAT POST DELIVERS FROM THE

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.163
POINT OF THE BASIC ACADEMY.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.666
THROUGH -- REGULAR ON GOING

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.334
TRAININGS AND THAT ALL THE WAY

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:35.901
UP THROUGH SENIOR LEADERSHIP

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:37.369
TRAINING -- I REALLY JUST HAVE

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:38.937
TO BE A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:40.673
WEAVING AND THREW OUT AND I

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:41.807
THINK MAYBE SOME OF THE

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.742
CONFUSION IS -- THAT THOSE

00:15:43.809 --> 00:15:46.078
EFFORTS REALLY REQUIRE A BROADER

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:48.180
APPROACH AND HOW WE REIMBURSE

00:15:48.247 --> 00:15:50.015
LOCALS -- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:15:50.082 --> 00:15:51.984
AGENCIES FOR ATTENDING TRIP --

00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:54.386
TRAININGS AND TO ENCOURAGE THEM

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:56.855
TO SIGN FOLKS -- AND SO.

00:15:56.922 --> 00:15:58.090
I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.025
CONFUSION ABOUT TRYING TO

00:16:00.092 --> 00:16:02.461
PINPOINT EXACTLY HOW THOSE

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:04.196
DOLLARS ARE SPENT FOR SPECIFIC.

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:05.731
PROGRAMS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:07.466
DEVELOPING STANDALONE CURRICULUM

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.134
IS REALLY ABOUT WEAVING THESE

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.669
COMPONENTS INTO EXISTING

00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:13.305
TRAININGS -- IN SO I APOLOGIZE

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:14.873
FOR THAT CONFUSION AYE AYE TH I

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:21.246
THINK THAT KIND OF SPEAKS TO

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.048
WHAT OUR INTENT IS THOUGH.

00:16:23.115 --> 00:16:23.782
OR POST RESPONSE.

00:16:23.849 --> 00:16:25.384
I WOULD IMAGINE NOW OBVIOUSLY

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:25.684
[inaudible]

00:16:25.751 --> 00:16:26.552
THE M..

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.853
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PRESENTED

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.021
TO US.

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.723
EARLY IN THE YEAR.

00:16:30.789 --> 00:16:34.626
AND BY THEIR YOU KNOW WAS ONLY

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:36.829
AT IS A BRIEFER PERIOD OF TIME

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:38.597
BETWEEN THE TIME WE ALLOCATED

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:40.366
THIS ONE TIME ONLY AND WHEN THE

00:16:40.432 --> 00:16:43.001
BUDGET WAS SUBMITTED -- BUT

00:16:43.068 --> 00:16:47.106
GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST EXPLAINED.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.407
AGAIN THERE'S NOT.

00:16:48.474 --> 00:16:52.444
WE BEFORE WE CAN DO UP THE

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:54.513
APPROPRIATE.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.115
OUR TRAINING WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:16:56.181 --> 00:16:57.549
CURRICULUM WE HAVE TO HAVE THE

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.351
EQUIPMENT WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL

00:16:59.418 --> 00:17:01.387
THE THINGS YOU REFERENCED.

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:03.055
WHICH YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:05.057
OF THE ALLOCATION OF THE TWENTY

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.558
FIVE MILLION ONE TIME ONLY WAS

00:17:06.625 --> 00:17:07.893
TO GET US IN THAT POSITION TO DO

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.762
SO.

00:17:09.828 --> 00:17:11.697
AND SINCE WE'RE NOT YET.

00:17:11.764 --> 00:17:13.365
IN THAT SITUATION TO DO SO.

00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:16.068
WHY WOULD WE NOW CERTAINLY I CAN

00:17:16.135 --> 00:17:18.003
APPRECIATE WHY POTENTIALLY IN

00:17:18.070 --> 00:17:19.104
THE FUTURE?

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.839
WE WOULD GREATLY BE EXPANDING

00:17:20.906 --> 00:17:23.709
POST BUDGET BASED ON NOW.

00:17:23.776 --> 00:17:25.511
THIS EXPANDED TRAINING THE

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.713
CURRICULUM WE HAVE ALL OF THAT.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.249
BUT WHEN WE HAVEN'T WE'RE NOT

00:17:30.315 --> 00:17:31.650
EVEN THERE YET.

00:17:31.717 --> 00:17:32.885
THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY I'M

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:36.121
HAVING.

00:17:36.188 --> 00:17:38.624
YEAH I I CAN APPRECIATE THAT I

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:40.292
THINK THAT THE FROM OUR

00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.860
STANDPOINT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:43.462
THAT POST IS BEING CAREFUL ON

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.130
HOW THEY PROCEED WITH SPENDING

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:46.331
THOSE DOLLARS IN THAT.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:47.466
THEY'RE DOING ENOUGH THOUGHTFUL

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:48.834
AND COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLISTIC

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.503
WAY -- I THINK THAT MISTER

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.604
ALVAREZ COULD BETTER SPEAK TO

00:17:52.671 --> 00:17:54.473
KIND OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH HAS

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:56.241
BEEN SPENT AND AND WHERE THEY'RE

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:59.011
AT AND THAT PROCESS BUT I THINK --

00:17:59.077 --> 00:18:01.113
WE ENCOURAGE THEM TO PROCEED

00:18:01.180 --> 00:18:02.748
THOUGHTFULLY AND NOT TO RUSH

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:05.284
FORWARD AND AND SPEND THE WAY

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.186
AND ON AND ON SPEND THE MONEY IN

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:07.753
A WAY THAT'S NOT GONNA BE AS

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:08.587
ACTIVE.

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.323
IS THERE BEFORE MISTER POST ME

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.659
MISTER ALVAREZ FOR POST ANSWERS.

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.194
IF THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:16.395

RAISE A EITHER -- EITHER MEMBER.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:25.137

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:34.873
LOCALLY.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:36.174
REIMBURSEMENT.

TRAINING EVERY TWO YEARS THAT IS

00:20:40.872 --> 00:20:41.673
NOT A LOT.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.241
ON THE AVERAGE PEACE OFFICER IN

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:46.345

THAT NUMBER WE WERE ABLE TO BUMP

00:21:03.562 --> 00:21:04.630
UP OVER THIS LAST CYCLE THAT IS

00:21:04.696 --> 00:21:06.898
A POSITIVE FOR US FROM FORTY

00:21:06.965 --> 00:21:08.433
THREE HOURS TO FORTY FOUR POINT

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.035
THREE WITHOUT THEM FEELING IT.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.236
WHICH IS A POSITIVE EITHER THE

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:12.738
TRAININGS MORE EFFICIENT IT'S

00:21:12.804 --> 00:21:14.940

TOOK A SOME TIME WE HAD TO HOLD

PUBLIC HEARINGS WE HAD TO WAIT

00:24:47.085 --> 00:24:48.987
FOR THE R. F. P. TO GET.

00:24:49.054 --> 00:24:51.189
THROUGH THE PROCESS AND GRANTS

00:24:51.256 --> 00:24:53.558
TO COMMAND THEY CAME IN IN LATE

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:54.259
FEBRUARY.

00:24:54.326 --> 00:24:56.595
ARM IT DIDN'T TAKE IT TOOK TIME

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.996
TO START FROM GROUND ZERO FROM

00:24:58.063 --> 00:24:59.564
SOME WE'VE NEVER DONE ADMITTEDLY

00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.701
BUT THREE POINT FOUR MILLION OF

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.036
IT WILL BE AWARDED NEXT WEEK.

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:05.837
THE OTHER IN THE OTHER.

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:09.541
THE OTHER COMPONENTS ARE DE-ESCALATION AND AND MENTAL HEALTH.

00:25:09.608 --> 00:25:11.376
SO IN TERMS OF THE DE ESCALATION

00:25:11.443 --> 00:25:12.477
TRAINING IT'S FIFTEEN MILLION

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:14.045
DOLLARS WE'VE ALREADY STARTED TO

00:25:14.112 --> 00:25:15.013
CONVERT SOME OF THE COURSES TO

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.748
BEING FULLY FUNDED WHICH TAKE

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:17.983
SOME TIME BECAUSE SOME OF THEM

00:25:18.049 --> 00:25:19.284
DO NOT HAVE BUDGETS.

00:25:19.351 --> 00:25:20.485
WE HAVE.

00:25:20.552 --> 00:25:22.153
TO WE HAVE TO ADD BUDGETS TO

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.089
EACH ONE WITH EACH.

00:25:24.155 --> 00:25:25.290
WITH EACH PRESENTER AS YOU CAN

00:25:25.357 --> 00:25:28.460
SEE THERE'S A WIDE ARRAY OF

00:25:28.526 --> 00:25:30.862
COURSES THEY NEED BUDGETS.

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:33.398
THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE DE

00:25:33.465 --> 00:25:34.332
ESCALATION TRAINING IS.

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:35.467
ARM.

00:25:35.533 --> 00:25:37.402
A QUICK MEANT I THINK FIVE

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:39.004
MILLION OF THAT MONEY COULD BE

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.739
USED FOR EQUIPMENT FOR DE

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:42.607
ESCALATION TRAINING PRIMARILY

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:43.942
FOR FORCE OPTION SIMULATORS ARE

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.343
VIRTUAL REALITY.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.046
TRAINING WE'VE HAD MEETINGS WITH

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:48.647
FIVE DIFFERENT.

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:52.684
VENDORS IN TERMS OF UPDATING OUR

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:55.353
EXISTING EQUIPMENT -- FOR FOR

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:56.888
SERGEANT SIMULATORS.

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.189
THE PROBLEM WITH IT IS WE HAVE

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:00.292
NOT FOUND A VENDOR AT THIS POINT

00:26:00.358 --> 00:26:01.993
OR AFP OR A PLATFORM.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.528
THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO CREATE THE

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:06.898
SCENARIOS YOU BASICALLY GET THE

00:26:06.965 --> 00:26:07.666
SCENARIOS FROM A VENDOR AND

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:09.100
THEY'RE VERY QUICK IF YOU'VE

00:26:09.167 --> 00:26:11.303
PROBABLY SEEN THEM THERE FIFTEEN

00:26:11.369 --> 00:26:12.237
SECOND SHOOT DON'T SHOOT.

00:26:12.304 --> 00:26:13.705
TYPE OF SCENARIOS WHICH WERE NOT

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:15.640
HAPPY WITH WE WANT TO MODEL THEM

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:17.475
IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATION SKILLS

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:19.878
AND AND MULTIPLE BRANCHES AND

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.346
YOU KNOW TO THREE MINUTE LONG.

00:26:21.413 --> 00:26:22.747
THE DIFFERENT THERE'S STILL A

00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:23.581
LOT OF DIFFERENT ONES BUT

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:26.284
PUTTING PROPRIETARY SCENARIOS ON

00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:27.686
THOSE MACHINES IS COMPLICATED.

00:26:27.752 --> 00:26:29.120
WE HAD TWO DEMONSTRATIONS FROM

00:26:29.187 --> 00:26:31.423
VIRTUAL REALITY -- COMPANIES ON

00:26:31.489 --> 00:26:33.024
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AND

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:34.292
WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO GO

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:35.727
THEY'RE NOT THERE YET WE HAD A

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:38.129
DEMO LASTS TWO WEEKS AGO.

00:26:38.196 --> 00:26:40.098
SO WE DON'T WANT T GO IN AND

PARSING OUT OF THE DATA FROM THE

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:54.592

00:30:21.686 --> 00:30:22.253

I DO I BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.194

DEALING WITH -- INDIVIDUALS WITH

00:30:55.386 --> 00:30:56.054
DISABILITIES.

RIGHT IT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN

00:30:58.656 --> 00:30:59.691
THE BEGINNING THE FIRST RIVER

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.326
TRAINING IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER

00:31:01.392 --> 00:31:02.694

LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER.

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:09.634
SO AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF

00:31:09.701 --> 00:31:10.068
MAKING SOME KIND OF

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:11.869
DETERMINATION.

00:31:11.936 --> 00:31:13.504
WHETHER THEY CAN COMPLETE THE

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.139
TRAINING PROPERLY OR NOT.

00:31:15.206 --> 00:31:17.675
DOES THE TRAINING INCLUDE THE

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:18.610
CULTURAL.

00:31:18.676 --> 00:31:20.578
CONFIDENCE.

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.247
YES THERE IS A CULTURAL

00:31:22.313 --> 00:31:25.083
DIVERSITY COMPONENT IN THE BASIC

00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:27.051
ACADEMY I CAN'T YOU KNOW.

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:28.086
STILL AHEAD BUT IT IT THERE IS A

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:29.654
SEPARATE LEARNING DOMAIN ON

00:31:29.721 --> 00:31:31.823
CULTURAL DIVERSITY INSIDE OF THE

00:31:31.889 --> 00:31:33.024
ACADEMY INTERESTING GETTING

00:31:33.091 --> 00:31:36.361
INFORMATION ABOUT THE THAT WAS

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:39.697
IN THE STATURE IT WITH US -- SO --

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:44.135
THE THE FIND SPENT ON USE OF

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:45.937
FORCE HOW MUCH MONEY WAS SPENT

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:49.207
ON USE OF FORCE TRAINING.

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.542
SO UP UNTIL THIS YEAR USE OF

00:31:51.609 --> 00:31:53.344
FORCE WE DID NOT.

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:54.712
WE DIDN'T FUNDED.

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:56.014
UNLESS IMPROVE THE USE OF FORCE

00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.651
OF A THE AGENCY.

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:00.952
HOW TO USE OF FORCE COURSE?

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:03.221
DID YOU REVIEWER LOOK AT THE

00:32:03.288 --> 00:32:04.422
COURSE WORK THAT THEY WERE

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.724
CLOSING -- EVERY USE OF FORCE

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.160
CORSET THAT IT'S IT WAS PROPOSED

00:32:09.227 --> 00:32:09.894
TO POST.

00:32:09.961 --> 00:32:11.262
WITH EITHER CERTIFIED OR NOT

00:32:11.329 --> 00:32:13.364
CERTIFIED BY POST IT IF IT

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.399
DIDN'T MEET OUR PERISHABLE

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:15.933
SKILLS REQUIREMENTS.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.035
THEN THE USE OF FORCE TRAINING

00:32:17.101 --> 00:32:19.737
WAS NOT FUNDED BY POST THEY JUST

00:32:19.804 --> 00:32:21.105
DID IT ON THEIR OWN.

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:21.606
I'M INTERESTED IN THEIR

00:32:21.673 --> 00:32:22.173
STANDARDS FOR APPROVAL OR

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.641
DISAPPROVAL OF THE USE OF FORCE

00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:26.244
TRAINING OKAY OF THEIR THERE.

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.745
IS CONTROVERSY ABOUT USE OF

00:32:27.812 --> 00:32:29.013
FORCE TRAINING AND COURSES WE

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.450
KNOWN -- THE QUESTION WOULD BE

00:32:32.517 --> 00:32:35.153
ARE WE ADEQUATELY REVIEWING --

00:32:35.219 --> 00:32:36.421
USE OF FORCE TRAINING IN TERMS

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:40.158
OF THE PROPER USE OF FORCE

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.660
TRAINING AND NOT THERE'S CERTAIN.

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:43.861
TYPES OF USE OF FORCE

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.596
CONSULTANTS.

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:49.167
THE TRAIN -- OFFICERS

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:50.468
DIFFERENTLY THEY'RE HIRED BY.

00:32:50.535 --> 00:32:51.736
POLICE AGENCIES.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.471
TRAINED OFFICERS DIFFERENTLY

00:32:53.538 --> 00:32:54.806
THAN OTHERS.

00:32:54.872 --> 00:32:57.241
SO WE HAVE TO DISCERN DISCERN

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:59.010
WHETHER OR NOT THE COURSES.

SOMETIMES GENERALLY SPEAKING

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.094
MOST OF THE TRAINING IT'S BEING

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:44.629
DONE IN CALIFORNIA IS POST

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.263

WE'VE HAD.

00:37:51.435 --> 00:37:53.237
THERE'S A DISINCENTIVE FOR THEM

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.672
TO GET OPPOSE CERTIFIED BECAUSE

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:56.107

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:58.542
ON THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:59.810
TRAINING IS PROPER THAT IT'S

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:01.278
GOOD AND THEN THEY HAVE SOME

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.713
BACKING FROM POST IF THEY GET

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.882
SUED.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:05.416
AND THEN AND THEN THERE'S

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.118
FUNDING BEHIND BUT IF THERE'S NO

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:09.053
FUNDING AT TIMES.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:10.287
THEN THEY DON'T COME TO US I

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.722
WANT TO KNOW WHY WOULD WHY WOULD

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:13.324
GIVE MONEY TO A POLICE

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.892
DEPARTMENT.

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.627
AND MAKE THEM CERTIFY THEIR

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:19.063
TRAINING FOR POST AND THEN HAVE

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.632
THEM GO AROUND US AND HAVE A NON

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:23.868

ON THE SAME SUBJECT.

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:27.772
OF OF TRAINING COMPLETELY

00:38:27.838 --> 00:38:29.840

00:38:29.907 --> 00:38:30.975
RIGHT OF THE TABLE THAT'S THAT'S

00:38:31.042 --> 00:38:32.476
THE ISSUE.

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:35.579
SO WE DON'T GIVE MONEY. TO THE

00:38:35.646 --> 00:38:38.149
DEPARTMENT FOR BOTH OF THOSE

00:38:38.215 --> 00:38:40.117

REFER TO THEM IN A GREAT

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:44.455
DEPARTMENT I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T

00:38:44.522 --> 00:38:45.656
USE THEM AS AN EXAMPLE.

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:47.958
BUT IF THEY DECIDE TO HAVE TO

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.060
USE A FORCED RATINGS AND THEY

00:38:49.126 --> 00:38:51.562
BRING ONE TO POST FOR POST

00:38:51.629 --> 00:38:52.663
CERTIFICATION.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:53.531
WE'RE GOING TO SCRUTINIZE THAT

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:55.399
COURSE TO MAKE SURE IT'S COMPLY

00:38:55.466 --> 00:38:57.068
IF IT'S WHATEVER IT IS WE'RE

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.736
GONNA MAKE A DECISION AS TO

00:38:58.803 --> 00:38:59.303
WHETHER WE HAVE THE MONEY TO

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.172
FUND IT.

WE'RE GONNA DO OUR POST

00:39:09.914 --> 00:39:10.915
CERTIFIED COURSE IT'S GONNA BE

00:39:10.981 --> 00:39:12.416
FUNDED BY POST WE'RE GONNA PAY

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:14.485
FOR THIS ONE ON OUR OWN AND IT

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.853
AND IT'S JUST BETWEEN THEM.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.788
THERE'S NO RULE THAT SAYS THAT

00:39:17.855 --> 00:39:19.490
PRIVATE PERSON HAS TO BE.

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.992
CLEARED BY YOU OR ANY NATIONAL

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:23.627
ORGANIZATION IF THEY COME FOR

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:25.229
POST CERTIFICATION SO THAT THE

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:26.864
OFFICERS CAN GET CREDIT FOR

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.633
TAKING THAT COURSE THEY GET NO

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.068
CREDIT FOR TAKING THAT COURSE.

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:33.270
I'M NOW THEY DON'T COME TO US IN

00:39:33.337 --> 00:39:34.338
ALL.

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.040
OF THE LITTLE CORRECT SIR.

00:39:36.107 --> 00:39:36.674
OKAY MAN CHART KIND OF

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:37.241
INTERESTED IN THIS BECAUSE I

00:39:37.308 --> 00:39:39.877
THINK THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE

00:39:39.944 --> 00:39:41.112
TRAINING THAT GOES ON IN THE

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:42.747
POLICE DEPARTMENT SORT.

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.281
THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTIONS --

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.217
I THINK WE NEED.

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:47.485
TO IT'S MORE ANSWERS ABOUT HOW

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.153
MUCH TRAINING.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.988
IS DONE BY POLICE DEPARTMENTS

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:54.291
OUTSIDE OF THE POST CERTIFIED.

00:39:54.358 --> 00:39:56.260
THAT'S WHERE THE I THINK MAYBE

00:39:56.327 --> 00:39:58.195
THE PROBLEM.

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.597
THAT IS CLAYTON AND IF I MAY SIR

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:00.931
THAT IS GOING TO BE A VERY DIFF

00:40:00.998 --> 00:40:02.867
IT'S HOW WE GONNA PROVE A

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:03.834
NEGATIVE I DON'T KNOW.

00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.937
WHAT THOSE COURSES ARE WE KNOW

00:40:07.004 --> 00:40:07.338
WHAT WE'RE DOING?

00:40:07.404 --> 00:40:09.540
BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE

00:40:09.607 --> 00:40:10.941
ALWAYS WE CANNOT TURN A BLIND

00:40:11.008 --> 00:40:12.810
EYE TO IT THAT'S YOU CAN YOU

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:15.012
KNOW THAT'S NOT WAT WE'RE GONNA

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.514
DO WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:18.883
AND I I I I I SIDE ON THE ON THE

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:20.217
SIDE OF IT IT SEEMS LIKE

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:22.086
CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.821
GOING DOWN THE RIGHT PATH AND I

00:40:23.888 --> 00:40:26.223
NOT BRING IN THESE.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.125
CRAZY AND XIN COURSES THAT WE IS

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.960
COMMUNITY DO NOT WANT THEM TO

00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:31.962
HAVE FOR WHAT I SEE MOST OF IT

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.364
IS POSITIVE.

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.298
POST CERTIFIED IF IT'S NOT

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:35.633
CLOSER TO FIGHT STILL GOOD

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:36.934
QUALITY TRAINING BUT THE

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:39.203
MAJORITY OF IT I THINK IS CLOSER

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.105
TO FIVE MY WORRY WOULD BE.

00:40:41.172 --> 00:40:42.306
I'M JUST FISHERMEN -- I'M SORRY

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:43.908
IT TOOK SO LONG BUT MY WORRY IS

00:40:43.974 --> 00:40:45.476
WE HAVE THESE POSTS CERTIFY YOUR

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:48.379
YOUR REGULATING THOSE ARE

00:40:48.445 --> 00:40:49.747
CERTIFYING ON AND THEN SOMETHING

00:40:49.814 --> 00:40:50.781
IS TRYING TO THE OFFICER THAT

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.650
COUNTERS.

00:40:52.716 --> 00:40:55.019
WHAT THE POST TRAINING?

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:57.621
AND I THINK THERE'S A DANGER.

00:40:57.688 --> 00:40:59.890
AND THAT HAPPENS POTENTIAL

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:03.127
DANGER WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:04.228
I DON'T CARE IF I CAN JUST.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:06.931
SAY SOMETHING -- MOST AGENCIES

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:08.465
AND I USED TO WORK WITH SEVERAL

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:10.000
AGENCIES AS I WAS ALONG FORCING

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:11.569
CONSULTANT I WAS ASSIGNED TO

00:41:11.635 --> 00:41:13.470
REGION ONE WHICH IS ALL WE HAVE

00:41:13.537 --> 00:41:14.405
TO NORTHERN COASTLINE.

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:16.040
MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY

00:41:16.106 --> 00:41:17.107
HEADS.

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.209
WILL NOT SEND THE PEOPLE TO

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:19.410
TRAIN IF IT IS NOT POST

00:41:19.476 --> 00:41:21.278
CERTIFIED IT'S NOT FINANCIALLY

00:41:21.345 --> 00:41:22.847
PRUDENT FOR THEM TO DO SO

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:23.848
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WE SET

00:41:23.914 --> 00:41:24.548
THE STANDARD.

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:25.282
YOU KNOW THAT WE SET THE

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:26.984
CURRICULUM AND TO BRING IN

00:41:27.051 --> 00:41:28.085
SOMEBODY FROM THE OUTSIDE THEY

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.119
JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.454
THAT I THINK IT'S A LOT LESS

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:31.655
THAN WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:33.290
AGAIN I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.458
I KNOW THAT I WAS WITH MY

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:35.726
AGENCIES.

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:37.695
ON A DAILY BASIS FOR FOUR YEARS

00:41:37.761 --> 00:41:39.330
AND I KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK FOR

00:41:39.396 --> 00:41:41.298
WHICH IS THE STANDARD THAT POST

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:42.166
SETS.

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:42.833
THE FUNDING THAT WE COULD

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:44.969
POSSIBLY PROVIDE TO THEM TO TO

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:46.170
TAKE THIS TRAINING.

00:41:46.237 --> 00:41:48.239
SO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY BE ON

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:49.707
THE OUT LIARS.

00:41:49.773 --> 00:41:51.842
I WOULD STICK TO THEIR VERY FEW

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:54.511
AND FAR BETWEEN.

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:55.179
RIGHT SO.

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:55.412
I THINK.

00:41:55.479 --> 00:41:57.147
WELL.

00:41:57.214 --> 00:42:00.851
BOTTOM LINE THE I'VE HEARD FROM

00:42:00.918 --> 00:42:02.119
MANY OF OUR AGENCIES THAT --

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.854
THERE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THE

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.256
CUTS TO POST.

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:07.958
HAVE A REDUCE THE AMOUNT THEIR

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:10.261
ACCESS TO TRAINING AND SO

00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:13.931
CLEARLY PART OF THE THE B. C. P.

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:18.936
AS AS DETAILED THE POST.

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:20.170
THE C. P..

00:42:20.237 --> 00:42:22.506
RESTORE SOME OF THAT FUNDING.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:25.376
WHICH WOULD YOU KNOW WHETHER

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:29.079
IT'S WHETHER IT'S ADEQUATE.

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:30.915
FOR THE THE LEVEL OF TRAINING

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.217
EITHER LEGISLATURE OR THE

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.386
AGENCIES WOULD WANT IN THE END

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:37.588
AND TO COVER ALL OFFICERS ARE

00:42:37.655 --> 00:42:39.623
NOT -- I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.592
BEFORE US BUT CLEARLY I SEE THAT

00:42:41.659 --> 00:42:43.694
THAT IS PART OF WHAT THE B. C.

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:45.062
P. ASTRIDE DESCRIBED.

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.398
THE THE REASON I RAISE THE

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:50.734
QUESTIONS IS. TO ME THAT'S THAT

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:52.069
IS A LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:54.638
BUT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:58.542
THEN THE FUNDING.

00:42:58.609 --> 00:43:00.744
FOR EXPANDED OR ENHANCE TRAINING

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:03.814
ON THINGS LIKE USE OF FORCE AND

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:05.082
THE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE OTHER.

00:43:05.149 --> 00:43:06.417
PRIORITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.519
HAD AND SO WHAT I SAW ON THE

00:43:08.585 --> 00:43:10.321
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND RATHER

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:11.956
IN THE GOVERNOR'S.

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:13.824
BUDGET WAS THAT [inaudible]

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:16.060
MOVE TOWARDS.

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.094
FUNDING THAT WOULD BE MORE

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:19.129
DIRECTED TOWARDS IN FACT

00:43:19.196 --> 00:43:21.765
ENHANCING OR IF NOT ENHANCING

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:24.468
MAKING ON GOING [inaudible]

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:28.238
THE NEW TRAINING A NEW

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:29.673
CURRICULUM THAT WAS DEVELOPED.

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:31.408
AS A RESULT OF THE ONE TIME ONLY

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.877
FUNDS.

00:43:33.944 --> 00:43:36.847
AND SO I I THINK.

00:43:36.914 --> 00:43:37.481
AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACT ON

00:43:37.548 --> 00:43:39.216
THIS TODAY BUT I THINK THAT WHAT

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:40.517
WILL WANT.

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:43.120
WHEN WE COME BACK IS?

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:45.689
SOME DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN THE

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:49.493
TWO AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.362
THE ONE TIME ONLY FUNDING TWENTY

00:43:51.428 --> 00:43:52.596
FIVE MILLION MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

00:43:52.663 --> 00:43:54.098
ABLE TO BE SPENT.

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:56.567
IN ONE YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:43:56.633 --> 00:43:58.135
YOU'RE WE WANT YOU TO GET THE

00:43:58.202 --> 00:43:59.603
RIGHT EQUIPMENT WE WANT YOU TO

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.938
DEVELOP A GOOD CURRICULUM.

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:02.673
IT WAS JUST VERY DISAPPOINTING

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.809
TO SEE THAT IT WAS ONLY THIRTY

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:06.377
FIVE THOUSAND THAT HAD BEEN

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:07.978
SPENT AT LEAST WITH THE NUMBERS

00:44:08.045 --> 00:44:09.546
THAT I WAS PROVIDED.

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:12.483
AND THEN TO SEE IN THE ON GOING

00:44:12.549 --> 00:44:15.819
BC HE THAT FOR EXAMPLE.

00:44:15.886 --> 00:44:16.720
UNDER THE TRAINING ENSURING

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.956
QUALITY THERE'S DEVELOP FOR

00:44:19.023 --> 00:44:20.858
SCENARIOS IT'S ONLY HALF A

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.526
MILLION BUT IT'S DEVELOP FOR

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:24.561
SCENARIOS. FOR FORCE OPTION

00:44:24.628 --> 00:44:27.464
SIMULATORS AND I'M THINKING OKAY --

00:44:27.531 --> 00:44:28.432
IS NOT.

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:29.767
PART OF THE USE THE TWENTY FIVE

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.301
MILLION WHY IS IT NEED TO BE IN

00:44:31.368 --> 00:44:32.703
THIS PCP.

00:44:32.770 --> 00:44:35.939
OR FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SUPPORT

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:36.940
INCREASED WORKLOAD DEVELOP NEW

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:38.342
COURSE MATERIALS CERTAINLY YOU

00:44:38.409 --> 00:44:39.843
MAY BE DEVELOPING NEW COURSE

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:42.046
MATERIALS IN SOME OTHER AREAS.

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:45.049
THAT'S OUR WOULDN'T POTENTIALLY

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.417
BE APPROPRIATE.

00:44:46.483 --> 00:44:48.152
BUT IF FOR EXAMPLE AND IT'S NOT

00:44:48.218 --> 00:44:50.487
CLEAR THIS WERE TO BE.

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.823
DEVELOPING NEW COURSE MATERIAL

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:54.725
PRIMARILY FOR THE USE OF FORCE.

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.160
OR THE OTHER MANDATES THAT WE

00:44:56.226 --> 00:44:57.061
GAVE YOU FOR THE TWENTY FIVE

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:57.494
MILLION.

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:59.763
THEN IT WOULD SEEM THAT THAT

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:01.198
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN APPROPRIATE

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:03.500
EXPENDITURE IN THE ONE TIME ONLY

00:45:03.567 --> 00:45:05.002
AND NOT IN THIS BCP.

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:07.504
OR THERE'S A COUPLE OF OTHERS

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:09.773
THAT YOU KNOW WE SO THAT'S WHAT.

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.976
WE'RE GONNA WANNA -- HAVE SOME

00:45:13.043 --> 00:45:15.079
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN WE

00:45:15.145 --> 00:45:17.614
WHEN WE ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION ON

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:17.815
THIS.

00:45:17.881 --> 00:45:20.150
I'M.

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:21.752
BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE LA --

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:24.488
BRIEFLY IF YOU CAN'T AND

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.290
ABSOLUTELY -- SO I NEED ONLY

00:45:26.356 --> 00:45:26.824
WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.158
OFFICE.

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:30.461
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING BEING

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.695
PROPOSED HERE IS A PRETTY

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.430
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:34.865
ONGOING LEVEL FUNDING PROVIDED

00:45:34.932 --> 00:45:35.566
TO POST.

00:45:35.632 --> 00:45:36.967
SIR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS THAT

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:38.368
THE LEGISLATURE REALLY ENSURE

00:45:38.435 --> 00:45:39.736
THAT WHATEVER FUNDING LEVEL

00:45:39.803 --> 00:45:41.572
THAT'S PROVIDED AND WHATEVER

00:45:41.638 --> 00:45:43.207
EXPENDITURE PLAN REALLY REFLECTS

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:44.475
PRIORITY.

00:45:44.541 --> 00:45:45.476
THE PLAN THAT POST AS PUT

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.044
FORWARD IS DEFINITELY ONE

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:49.113
APPROACH -- TO PROVIDE THAT

00:45:49.179 --> 00:45:50.314
TRAINING BECAUSE THEY'VE CLEARLY

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:52.816
EVALUATED ALL OF THE PROGRAM'S

00:45:52.883 --> 00:45:53.383
EXETER AND CAME UP WITH THIS

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:54.485
PLAN.

00:45:54.551 --> 00:45:55.953
THAT BEING SAID THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:56.019 --> 00:45:58.155
IN RECENT YEARS HAS GONE DOWN

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:00.190
THE PATH OF EXPRESSING SPECIFIC

00:46:00.257 --> 00:46:02.593
EXPECTATIONS AND PRIORITIES AND

00:46:02.659 --> 00:46:03.760
SO THEY COULD CHOOSE TO DO SO

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:05.095
AGAIN PARTICULARLY SINCE THIS

00:46:05.162 --> 00:46:05.929
AND THEN IT THIS IS AN

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.831
INVESTMENT ONGOING DOLLARS

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:09.233
THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT.

00:46:09.299 --> 00:46:10.200
SO THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:11.702
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT THE

00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:13.704
LEGISLATURE ADOPTED TRAILER BILL

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:15.205
LANGUAGE REQUIRING POST REPORT

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.174
ANNUALLY ON SPECIFIC OUTCOME IN

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:18.509
PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT ARE

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:19.910
TIED TO WHATEVER FUNDING THAT'S

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.378
PROVIDED.

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:22.312
AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.414
LEGISLATURE MONITOR THE USE OF

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:26.350
THOSE DOLLARS AND EVALUATE HOW

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:27.718
THE FUNDING IS USED.

00:46:27.784 --> 00:46:28.886
AND ALSO TO HELP THEM MAKE

00:46:28.952 --> 00:46:31.021
DECISIONS IN THE FUTURE SO FOR

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.756
EXAMPLE IF THE LEGISLATURE --

00:46:32.823 --> 00:46:35.592
pFUNDING IN THE FUTURE OR CHANGE

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:37.594
THE MIX THAT SORT OF REPORTING

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:38.762
WOULD HELP THEM WITH THEIR

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:42.099
DECISION MAKING.

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.100
THANK YOU.

00:46:43.167 --> 00:46:44.735
I'M IN JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER

00:46:44.801 --> 00:46:46.937
POINTS -- SENATOR BILL RAISE

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:48.872
SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND.

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:54.178
THE QUALITY AND HE RAISED.

00:46:54.244 --> 00:46:56.980
ME MUCH OF THE QUESTIONS WERE IN

00:46:57.047 --> 00:46:58.682
MORE IN THE POTENTIAL

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:00.651
DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE QUALITY

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:02.553
OF TRAINING IS THAT A DEPARTMENT

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:03.820
MIGHT PURSUE THAT OUR POST

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:04.988
CERTIFIED.

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.823
BUT I THINK ADDITIONALLY.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.425
THERE'S BEEN.

00:47:08.492 --> 00:47:10.627
SOME INDICATION BY SOME AGENCIES

00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:14.431
THAT THERE'S A OUR ONE USE WIDE

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.132
CASSETTE.

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:17.000
YOU KNOW ANECDOTAL INFORMATION

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.302
IS NOT REALLY ACCURATE TIP BUT

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.204
THERE'S A A VARIANCE IN THE

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.505
QUALITY EVEN OF THE POST

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.406
TRAININGS [inaudible]

00:47:22.472 --> 00:47:26.376
AND SO ONE QUESTION WOULD BE HOW

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.645
IS POST CURRENTLY ASSESSING THAT

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:31.715
QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:34.151
MORE ASSURANCE THAT THERE'S HIGH

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.986
LEVEL QUALITY AMONGST ALL OF

00:47:36.053 --> 00:47:37.020
THOSE.

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:39.890
AND WHAT IS IN PLACE TO ASSESS

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.692
WHETHER THOSE TRAININGS ACTIVE

00:47:41.758 --> 00:47:42.926
OR NOT [inaudible]

00:47:42.993 --> 00:47:44.661
YEAH [inaudible]

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:46.029
I'M.

00:47:46.096 --> 00:47:47.164
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.032
UNDERSTAND THAT WE USED TO HAVE

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:50.400
A QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM.

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:53.070
RATHER ROBUST ONE THAT WE HAD TO

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:56.240
REDUCE ARE ACTUALLY -- GET RID

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.008
OF BECAUSE OF THE DWINDLING

00:47:58.075 --> 00:47:59.543
BUDGET AND ONE THING IN THE B.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.777
C. P. THAT WE PUT IN WAS TO

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.279
AUGMENT THAT BY A MILLION

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:04.848
DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY DO EXACTLY

00:48:04.915 --> 00:48:06.250
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHICH IS.

00:48:06.316 --> 00:48:07.918
GO OUT AND ACTUALLY STAND THERE

00:48:07.985 --> 00:48:09.519
AND WATCH THE TRAINING TO ENSURE

00:48:09.586 --> 00:48:11.588
THE FACT THESE THE QUALITY IS

00:48:11.655 --> 00:48:13.557
THE SAME THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:14.091
THAT'S ONE OF OUR OUR BIG

00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:16.526
TARGETS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.428
TO TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:48:18.495 --> 00:48:20.330
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS WITH OUR

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:21.231
WITH OUR BUDGET.

00:48:21.298 --> 00:48:23.567
AM WE'VE GONE FROM A HUNDRED

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:26.336

LIKE TO DO AND WE HAVE A VERY

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:30.173
ROBUST PROGRAM IN PLACE ON HOW

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.977
WE WILL EXPAND THIS MONEY.

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:35.712
WHICH IS IN -- WE EVEN INTO THE

00:48:35.779 --> 00:48:36.713
THE PAPERWORK THEM THAT WE

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:38.448

TESTIMONY.

00:48:39.516 --> 00:48:41.652
BUT IT'S GOING TO BE THE WAY WE

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.220
ENVISION THIS IS YOU'RE NOT JUST

FOR AND THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.821
LINE FOR ME.

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:20.957
IF IF I MAY ADD ON TO A WITNESS

00:49:21.024 --> 00:49:23.193
SANDOVAL SAID.

AND AGAIN NOT TO JUST JUMP TO A

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:39.242
CONCLUSION BUT WITHOUT HAVING

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:40.377
YOU GIVE MORE EXPLANATION I GOT

00:49:40.444 --> 00:49:41.478
ASSUME THERE'S NO QUALITY

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.946
ASSESSMENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:44.047
THAT THE CASE.

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:46.249
THAT IS CORRECT THERE'S NOBODY

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.585
RECESSED MOTION OF THAT THERE

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:50.120
THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT PROGRAM.

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:51.888
HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED AT POST.

00:49:51.955 --> 00:49:53.523
THERE IS QUALITY ASSESSMENT WITH

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.258
THE TRAINING MANAGERS THROUGHOUT

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:57.160
THE REGIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR OWN

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.462
TRAINING PROGRAMS.

00:49:58.528 --> 00:50:00.330
BUT AS FAR AS A SENDING

00:50:00.397 --> 00:50:01.531
INDIVIDUALS.

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:03.834
TO OUTSIDE OF JUST THE REGULAR --

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.802
COURSES WE DO MONITOR THE POLICE

00:50:05.869 --> 00:50:06.903

WE DO MONITOR OUR LEGACY COURSES

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.507

THERE'S OVER. 400-040-00300

00:50:14.611 --> 00:50:16.246
COURSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:50:16.313 --> 00:50:17.781
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO KEEP A

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:19.816
TIGHT CLOSE LID ON THEM AS MUCH

00:50:19.883 --> 00:50:20.717
AS WE WOULD LIKE TO BECAUSE OF

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:22.219
THE DWINDLING RESOURCES AND AND

00:50:22.285 --> 00:50:22.986
FINANCIAL.

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:25.088
IMPACT POST.

00:50:25.155 --> 00:50:26.990
IF I CAN ADD MADAM CHAIR EVERY

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:28.392
COURSE THERE'S A SURVEY THAT'S

00:50:28.458 --> 00:50:30.093
DONE EITHER FOR THE ONLINE

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:32.129
COURSES OR THE AND PERSON

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:33.363
COURSES THAT WE REVIEW.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.665
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA SLI

00:50:35.732 --> 00:50:36.933
IS ONE OF OUR FOUNDATIONAL

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:38.668
INSTRUCTION COURSES IT COSTS A

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:41.037
LOT OF MONEY IT'S EIGHT MONTHS

00:50:41.104 --> 00:50:42.372
OF TRAINING FOR IT SERGEANTS.

00:50:42.439 --> 00:50:44.341
ARM.

00:50:44.408 --> 00:50:45.776
JUST REVIEWING THOSE OUTLINES WE

00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:47.511
PICKED UP ON A VERY VERY

00:50:47.577 --> 00:50:49.346
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM LAST YEAR.

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.814
BUT THE OUTLINES BY REVIEWING

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.816
THOSE SUMMARIES WE GOT RID OF

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.985
WELL WE GOT RID OF A PERSON WAS.

00:50:55.051 --> 00:50:57.020
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO DO ANYMORE

00:50:57.087 --> 00:50:59.656
SLI TRAINING FORCE BASED ON SOME

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:00.257
OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:01.158
FINDING.

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:02.926
SO WE ARE REVIEWING ALL THE

00:51:02.993 --> 00:51:04.027
SURVEYS.

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.762
THEY'RE BEING DONE AFTER THE

00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:07.397
COURSE IS COMPLETE AND A WHAT

00:51:07.464 --> 00:51:09.466
MISS SANDOVAL SAID IS CORRECT IS

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.435
IF IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:51:11.501 --> 00:51:13.203
START HEARING ABOUT WHERE WE HAD

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.604
INDEPENDENT PEOPLE TO GO OUT AND

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:16.139
I DID SOME OF THESE COURSES OR

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.507
WHEN WE SEE THAT THEIR SMOKE

00:51:17.574 --> 00:51:18.008
COMING.

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:18.942
IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION WE COULD

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:21.178
SEND PEOPLE WE DON'T HAVE THAT

00:51:21.244 --> 00:51:23.246
ABILITY BUT WHAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:51:23.313 --> 00:51:24.481
AN ABILITY ANYMORE BUT WHAT WE

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.549
ARE DOING IS.

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.217
WE DO SAID POST STAFF JUST TO

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:28.218
GIVE YOU AN IDEA WE SUPPOSE

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:31.421
STAFF MEMBER. TWO MONTHS AGO. TO

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.390
COME OFF LINE TO GO SIT ON A

00:51:33.457 --> 00:51:35.859
COURSE WHERE WE HAD HEARD

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:36.660
RUMBLINGS.

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.361
THAT THE INSTRUCTOR THAT WAS

00:51:38.428 --> 00:51:39.629
SUPPOSED TO BE TEACHING THE

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:40.764
COURSE WASN'T THE INSTRUCTOR

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:41.064
[inaudible]

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:43.033
IT WASN'T.

00:51:43.099 --> 00:51:44.568
IT WASN'T THE INSTRUCTOR THAT

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.036
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE LISTED THAT

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.437
THEY WERE SELLING THEIR WARES

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:48.939
FROM THEIR PRIVATE COMPANY YOU

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:50.874
KNOW FOR THE FIRST X. AMOUNT OF

00:51:50.941 --> 00:51:51.708
MINUTES.

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:52.809
THAT THEIR T. SHIRTS IN THE BACK

00:51:52.876 --> 00:51:54.744
YOU KNOW MARKETING THEIR COMPANY.

00:51:54.811 --> 00:51:56.213
SO WE TOOK HIM OFF LINE.

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:57.547
BUT THAT WAS ONE INDIVIDUAL

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.015
STAFF MEMBER THAT HAD TO GO DO

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:00.550
THAT WHEN WE HEARD OF A PROBLEM.

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.552
SO WE DO WANT TO DO MORE OF THAT

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.054
AND THE OTHER THING NOT JUST

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:06.122
WHEN THERE'S PROBLEMS WE WANT TO

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.357
KNOW THAT OUR TRAINING IS GOOD

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:08.758
QUALITY TRAINING AND THAT'S WHAT

00:52:08.825 --> 00:52:10.227
WE PUT INTO THE B. C. P. WE WANT

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:12.229
PEOPLE. TO GO IN AND LOOK AT

00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:13.730
FIVE OF OUR DE ESCALATION

00:52:13.797 --> 00:52:14.931
COURSES AND TELL US WHAT'S WRONG

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:17.000
WITH THEM NOT JUST TO TELL US

00:52:17.067 --> 00:52:18.468
WHETHER THE PERSON SELLING.

00:52:18.535 --> 00:52:20.904
CHALLENGE COINS DURING THEIR YOU

00:52:20.971 --> 00:52:22.772
KNOW THEIR PRESENTATION.

00:52:22.839 --> 00:52:24.741
BUT ARM IT'S A CHALLENGE RIGHT

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.476
NOW IS MISS SANDOVAL POINTED BUT

00:52:26.543 --> 00:52:27.911
WE DO GET WE DO ASK FOR

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:31.448
RESPONSES FOR EVERY COURSE.

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:33.750
COMPLETION.

00:52:33.817 --> 00:52:37.521
I'M GIVING YOUR REFERENCE.

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:39.823
TO I'M THERE IS.

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.958
IN THE B. C. P. THE FOURSOME

00:52:42.025 --> 00:52:46.029
LATER -- THAT I MENTIONED -- I

00:52:46.096 --> 00:52:48.398
KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE THE

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:48.632
VIRTUES.

00:52:48.698 --> 00:52:50.267
THAT.

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.801
TYPE OF EQUIPMENT WHICH IS A

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:54.804
VIRTUAL REALITY EQUIPMENT.

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:57.641
IS ONE OF THE WAYS THAT -- USE

00:52:57.707 --> 00:53:01.011
OF FORCES TRAINED ON SO THE

00:53:01.077 --> 00:53:03.513
QUESTION I HAVE IS.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:08.752
WHO IS MAKING BE -- WHO?

00:53:08.818 --> 00:53:10.353
WHO ARE USING TO MAKE THE

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.722
ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER?

00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:14.724
IT IS THE BEST TRAINING APPROACH.

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:17.294
AND WHETHER THE EQUIPMENT THAT

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:17.861
EITHER YOU HAVE -- YOU MIGHT

00:53:17.928 --> 00:53:21.932
WANT TO BE. TO BE ACQUIRING.

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.233
IS THE BEST APPROACH

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:23.533
[inaudible]

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.735
OKAY.

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:26.336
NO IT.

00:53:26.403 --> 00:53:28.038
I BELIEVE IT'S A MULTI PRONGED

00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:30.040
APPROACH WITH THE SIMULATORS --

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:32.275
SO.

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:33.777
ONE THE EQUIPMENT HAS TO BE GOOD

00:53:33.843 --> 00:53:34.911
EQUIPMENT RIGHT I DON'T THINK

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.613
VIRTUAL REALITY EQUIPMENT IS

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.149
NECESSARILY WORDS SHOULD BE.

00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:40.483
THE FOR SUCTION SIMULATORS ARE

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:41.985
GOOD BUT THE SCENARIOS.

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.386
ARE PROBABLY WHAT WE ALL WOULD

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.155
LIKE.

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:46.856
INTO ITS INSTRUCTOR IT'S IT'S

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:47.924
PUSHING THE BUTTON ON THE

00:53:47.991 --> 00:53:49.292
MACHINE TO PROVIDE PROPER

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:51.261
INSTRUCTION AND FEEDBACK IN

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:52.729
TERMS OF COVER AND CONCEALMENT

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.097
DID YOU CONSIDER THIS DID YOU

00:53:54.164 --> 00:53:55.865
CONSIDER THAT OR THEY JUST HIT

00:53:55.932 --> 00:53:56.866
PLAY ON THE MACHINE.

00:53:56.933 --> 00:53:58.234
AND GOOD YOU DID A GOOD JOB AND

00:53:58.301 --> 00:54:00.637
WALK OUT SO IT'S A MULTI PRONGED

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:01.605
APPROACH.

00:54:01.671 --> 00:54:03.740
WE HAVE AN INSTRUCTOR COURSE FOR

00:54:03.807 --> 00:54:06.543
THOSE SIMULATORS ARM.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:07.143
THAT I DON'T BELIEVE HAS BEEN

00:54:07.210 --> 00:54:09.746
FUNDED -- BUT IT'S THERE I THINK

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:11.047
WE TRAINED.

00:54:11.114 --> 00:54:12.315
IN A COUPLE HUNDRED OFFICERS A

00:54:12.382 --> 00:54:14.117
YEAR ON THAT COURSE.

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.987
BUT IT'S ALL OF THAT THAT MAKES

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:18.455
IT WORK PROPERLY.

00:54:18.521 --> 00:54:19.623
SO PART OF MY QUESTION IS SO ARE

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:20.824
WE SO WHAT I'M UNDERSTAND FROM

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.258
WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS THAT.

00:54:22.325 --> 00:54:24.761
IT IS INTERNAL POST STAFF.

00:54:24.828 --> 00:54:26.329
THAT WOULD BE DOING THOSE

00:54:26.396 --> 00:54:27.430
ASSESSMENTS [inaudible]

00:54:27.497 --> 00:54:29.499
I'M.

00:54:29.566 --> 00:54:31.101
AND I'M NOT THE NO JUDGMENT ON

00:54:31.167 --> 00:54:32.936
THIS NO NO OPINION ON IT BUT

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:36.006
VERSUS SAY AN EXTERNAL.

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:37.374
ENTITY THAT YOU MIGHT.

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.109
CONTRACT WITH OR SOMETHING SO

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:41.111
IT'S INTERNAL POST STAFF THAT DO

00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:46.082
BOTH THE ASSESSMENTS INSTRUCTOR

00:54:46.149 --> 00:54:48.551
IN SUCH.

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:49.986
SEC BRECHT RIGHT WE HAVE.

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:52.255
ONE GOING ALONG WITH -- SUBJECT

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:54.024
MATTER EXPERTS.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:56.626
SO WE ONCE WE CAN TRY AND NARROW

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:59.062
THINGS DOWN TO CERTAIN VENDORS.

00:54:59.129 --> 00:55:00.697
WE WILL BRING IN INDIVIDUALS

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:01.998
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO COME IN

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:03.433
AND LOOK AT IT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:04.534
ACTUALLY IN THE FIELD.

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.302
DOING THE JOB CURRENTLY AS WELL

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.004
AS OUR POST STAFF. ONE OF THE

00:55:08.071 --> 00:55:09.205
THINGS HE SAW THAT YOU MENTION

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.106
ABOUT THE FORCE OFTEN SIMILAR

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.642
SCENARIOS WE WANT TO DO FOR HIS

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:14.277
NEW SCENARIOS A YEAR WITH THE

00:55:14.344 --> 00:55:15.679
ABILITY TO HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL

00:55:15.745 --> 00:55:17.213
MAKE A DECISION.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.381
AND I THEY MAKE ONE DECISION

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:19.549
THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING DOWN ONE

00:55:19.616 --> 00:55:20.917
PATH OF MAKE A DECISION OTHER

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:22.218
DECISION ARE TAKING ON DIFFERENT

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:23.053
PATHS.

00:55:23.119 --> 00:55:24.721
FIRST IS -- WHAT SENATOR BILL

00:55:24.788 --> 00:55:25.321
JUST WENT THROUGH WHICH WAS A

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.322
SHOOT DON'T SHOOT?

00:55:26.389 --> 00:55:27.891
THOSE DON'T DO A WHOLE LOT FOR

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:29.325
DECISION MAKING PROCESSES AND

00:55:29.392 --> 00:55:30.960
DEVELOPING MATURITY ON THE HAVE

00:55:31.027 --> 00:55:32.362
A ON BEHALF OF THE POLICE

00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:33.263
OFFICER.

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:34.631
SO IT'S KIND OF INTERNAL AS WELL

00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:36.266
AS IT WILL BE EXTERNAL BECAUSE

00:55:36.332 --> 00:55:37.734
WE DO NEED.

00:55:37.801 --> 00:55:39.302
OUR EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:43.840
HAVE BY AND AND AND GIVE US THAT

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:45.275
THE CURRENT PRACTICES.

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.342
NOBODY I THINK AGAIN.

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:47.010
GIVEN THE LEGISLATURE'S

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:47.410
DIRECTION.

00:55:47.477 --> 00:55:51.147
IN TERMS OF THE WHILE.

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:53.016
WELL THERE WAS NOT [inaudible]

00:55:53.083 --> 00:56:00.457
ON A POLICY DIRECTIVE AS TO WHAT

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:06.596
THE WHAT AM I A S. HOW DO I

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.498
COMMUNICATE THIS THAT.

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:10.633
WELL THERE WASN'T A A POLICY

00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.036
DIRECTIVE IN ALL RIGHT HERE IS

00:56:13.103 --> 00:56:17.307
WHAT THE OF FLOOR.

00:56:17.373 --> 00:56:18.541
FOR USE OF FORCE INDIA

00:56:18.608 --> 00:56:21.044
ESCALATION TRAINING SHOULD BE.

00:56:21.111 --> 00:56:22.545
THE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:24.814
MORE [inaudible]

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.516
TOWARD JUST.

00:56:26.583 --> 00:56:28.084
IMPROVE AN INCREASE AND FOCUS ON

00:56:28.151 --> 00:56:29.552
IT [inaudible]

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:35.525
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THOSE THINGS

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:39.362
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE WE

00:56:39.429 --> 00:56:40.864
PROCEED WITH.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.534
THE NEW SCENARIOS [inaudible]

00:56:44.601 --> 00:56:46.503
RIGHT THOSE.

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:47.570
SO.

00:56:47.637 --> 00:56:48.571
I THINK THE THE MISSING

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:49.806
COMPONENT WITH IT IS THE

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:52.308
EQUIPMENT AT THIS BY RIGHT SO

00:56:52.375 --> 00:56:54.244
THE SCENARIOS ACROSS THE STATE

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:55.845
ARE STANDARDIZED POSTED AREAS WE

00:56:55.912 --> 00:56:57.147
TRAIN.

00:56:57.213 --> 00:56:58.715
THE INSTRUCTORS ON THOSE POSTING

00:56:58.782 --> 00:57:00.116
AREAS AND HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:02.018
TO USE THE MACHINES AND WHAT

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:03.286
TOPICS ARE SUPPOSED TO HEAR WHAT.

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:05.088
AREAS ARE SUPPOSED YES BUT WE'VE

00:57:05.155 --> 00:57:08.358
JUST GIVEN YOU WE'VE GIVEN YOU A

00:57:08.424 --> 00:57:08.992
NEW DIRECTOR OF AGAIN WITHOUT.

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:12.328
A LOT OF DETAIL REGARDING YOU

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.397
KNOW WHAT MODIFICATIONS IN

00:57:14.464 --> 00:57:16.166
POLICY THERE MIGHT BE.

00:57:16.232 --> 00:57:21.771
BUT THAT MIGHT THEN INFORM.

00:57:21.838 --> 00:57:23.673
WHAT THE SCENARIOS ARE

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:23.973
[inaudible]

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:28.144
RIGHT.

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.213
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY.

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.581
YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:33.449
HAVE THE SCENARIOS IN PLACE WELL

00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:38.188
WE SHOULD HAVE THE THE HE RIVER.

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.156
REVAMPS NEW ENHANCE RIVER

00:57:40.223 --> 00:57:42.725
CURRICULUMS.

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.194
IN PLACE.

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:47.030
THAT WOULD HELP THEN INFORM THE

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:48.965
WITH THOSE SCENARIOS ARE IF

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:50.767
GIVEN AGAIN THAT THE TWENTY FIVE

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:53.169
MILLION. ONE TIME ONLY WAS NOT

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.804
JUST FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY.

00:57:54.871 --> 00:57:57.073
IT WAS FOR ENHANCING POSTS

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.876
ABILITY TO DO TRAINING REGARDING

00:57:59.943 --> 00:58:01.277
USE OF COURSE.

00:58:01.344 --> 00:58:03.713
ANTI ESCALATION AND I'M SURE

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.215
THERE IS A COUPLE OF THE THINGS

00:58:05.281 --> 00:58:06.616
I DON'T HAVE THE LANGUAGE.

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:08.952
DIRECTLY BEFORE BY.

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:14.357
THOSE -- THOSE SIMULATORS ARE.

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:16.159
THAT'S PART OF WHAT THEY ARE

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:18.428
USED.

00:58:18.494 --> 00:58:19.762
FOR YEAH ONE PART NOT THE ONLY.

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:22.031
YEAH.

00:58:22.098 --> 00:58:22.632
SO IT'S KIND OF THE POINT I'M

00:58:22.699 --> 00:58:23.399
MAKING.

00:58:23.466 --> 00:58:25.034
THE ONLY OTHER QUESTION I HAVE

00:58:25.101 --> 00:58:26.035
IS.

00:58:26.102 --> 00:58:27.003
AND AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE A

00:58:27.070 --> 00:58:28.171
CRYSTAL BALL YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:29.939
THE LEGISLATURE WILL DO BUT WE

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.041
DO HAVE A COUPLE OF BILLS BEFORE

00:58:32.108 --> 00:58:32.208
US.

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:36.512
THAT COULD -- COULD.

00:58:36.579 --> 00:58:41.117
WEIGH IN ON WHAT EITHER ON SOME

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:42.619
FOCUSES ON TRAINING OR SOME

00:58:42.685 --> 00:58:45.288
CHANGES IN USE OF FORCE RULES.

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:49.759
I WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW.

00:58:49.826 --> 00:58:51.294
I SUPPOSE IN ANTICIPATION OF

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.462
THAT SO THAT YOU DON'T

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:54.297
NECESSARILY HAVE TO RE CREATE

00:58:54.364 --> 00:58:57.467
TRAINING LATER.

00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:58.902
SO OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT TAKING A

00:58:58.968 --> 00:59:01.204
POSITION ON EITHER OF COURSE NOT

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.740
EITHER BILL -- YOU KNOW.

00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:04.941
I THINK WE'RE IN A POSITION WE

00:59:05.008 --> 00:59:09.345
HAVE PLENTY OF USE OF FORCE --

00:59:09.412 --> 00:59:11.247
OF A FOUNDATION ON USE OF FORCE

00:59:11.314 --> 00:59:12.448
TRAINING PRIMARILY FROM THE

00:59:12.515 --> 00:59:14.117
BASIC ACADEMY.

00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:15.218
THE WE WILL INCORPORATE INTO

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:17.320
WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THE

TWO PROGRAMS DIFFERENTLY THAN WE

01:09:32.535 --> 01:09:34.370

AND THE STATE OF WASHINGTON. TO

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:42.378

LOOKING A CONSOLIDATION AND WHAT

01:09:44.780 --> 01:09:47.883

VICTIMS BEING UNDER OUR NON

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.581
REPORTED.

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:06.482
IT ONE OF THE PIVOTAL

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:08.217
FOUNDATIONS OF OUR PROGRAM

01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:11.120
ADMINISTRATION IS TO ENSURE THAT

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:14.356
THE VICTIMS CAN ACCESS A VARIETY

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.525
OF TRAUMA INFORMED VICTIM

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.893
CENTERED SERVICE IN A SETTING

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.595
THAT IS COMFORTABLE FOR THEM.

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.296
SO THAT THEY ARE COMFORTABLE IN.

01:13:21.363 --> 01:13:23.332
IN REPORTING AND GETTING SUPPORT

01:13:23.398 --> 01:13:24.633
FROM THOSE THAT CAN HELP THEM

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.702
AND ARE EQUIPPED TO HELP THEM

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:28.036
AND RECOVER FROM FROM THOSE

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:29.338
THOSE CRIMES.

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.373
AND SO THROUGH THIS PROCESS WE

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.609
HAVE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH OUR

01:13:33.675 --> 01:13:35.043
VICTIMS COMPENSATION PARTNERS AS

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:36.111
WELL AS SOME OF OUR OTHER STATE

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.312
AGENCY PARTNERS.

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:41.483
THAT -- THAT ALSO HAVE SERVICES

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.984
FOR THE VICTIMS OR THEIR

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.484
FAMILIES.

01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:44.820
SO IN THE REPORT THERE WERE A

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:48.290
FEW OPTIONS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:50.459
THAT REALLY TOOK A COUPLE OF

01:13:50.526 --> 01:13:51.693
DIFFERENT APPROACHES WHEN WAS

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:52.494
WAS.

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:53.929
DOING NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:55.264
I THINK ONE THING IN GOVERNMENT

01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:56.431
IS THAT WE COULD ALWAYS DO

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.033
BETTER AND IF WE LISTEN TO THOSE

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.434
THE RECEIVER SERVICES.

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:01.403
AND FROM THOSE THAT PROVIDE

01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:03.539
THOSE SERVICES WE CAN DO BETTER

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.607
TO REACH MORE AND AND HELP THOSE

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.676
IN NEED -- THERE IS THE

01:14:07.743 --> 01:14:09.244
CONSOLIDATION WITHIN ONE OF OUR

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:11.914
ORGANIZATIONS OR THE ENTIRE OR

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:13.582
CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW ENTITY.

01:14:13.649 --> 01:14:14.950
AND THEN WHAT WE REALLY FOCUSED

01:14:15.017 --> 01:14:17.319
IN ON IS WORKING TO STREAMLINE

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:18.954
AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICES AND

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.956
CONDUCTING A PHASED APPROACH TO

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.825
CONSOLIDATION WITH THE KEY

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:23.892
EMPHASIS OF THAT GREATER

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:25.060
COLLABORATION.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:26.929
WHICH WE HEARD FROM AS WE

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:27.930
CONDUCTED THOSE OUR REACH

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.531
OFFENSE AND SURVEYS IS THAT THEY

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.133
WERE LOOKING FOR CONSISTENCY AND

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:32.334
TO BE LISTENED TO AND REALLY

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.203
TAKING THEIR INPUT AND ADVICE

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.271
AND THEN PROGRAMMING GOES INTO

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.974
OUR RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENTS --

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:39.708
HAVING GONE THROUGH THREE

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:41.243
DIFFERENT CONSOLIDATIONS I

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:44.246
WITHIN -- YES SINCE -- TWO

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:44.880
THOUSAND FOUR ONE OF THE THINGS

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:45.981
THAT WE KNOW IS THAT IT IS

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:49.117
IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE THOSE THAT

01:14:49.184 --> 01:14:51.720
WE SERVE AND OUR STAKEHOLDERS

01:14:51.787 --> 01:14:53.088
AND DO IT VERY METHODICALLY SO

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.090
APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:55.691
FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:56.491
SHOULDN'T.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:57.726
SUPPORT AND ATTENTION TO THIS

01:14:57.793 --> 01:14:59.895
VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT AS WE WORK

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.463
THROUGH BUT AS WE SAID DOING

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.398
NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION AND

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.133
THAT GREATER COLLABORATION.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.502
AS A JUST A FEW OF THE RESULTS

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:10.472
OF THAT COLLABORATION -- INCLUDE

01:15:10.539 --> 01:15:12.541
ART JOINT PRESENTATIONS AS WE

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:14.710

ONE VOICE FROM THE VICTIM'S

01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:26.021

GETTING REAL FUNDAMENTAL BUT WE

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:44.926
SHOULD MISS HAVE BEEN DONE

01:17:44.993 --> 01:17:45.227
[inaudible]

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:46.728
YEARS AGO.

01:17:46.795 --> 01:17:48.563
WELL AS YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.999
HAVE BEEN MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:53.068
BEEN UNDERTAKEN -- TO TO

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:56.405
CONSOLIDATE AND IN FACT -- IN

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:57.539
TWO THOUSAND FOUR WAS OF WHEN

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:58.573
THE OFFICE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.942
FUNDING WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.411
THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.212
I DO TOO ARE THE CAPABILITY OF

01:18:04.279 --> 01:18:06.014
OF GRANT MANAGEMENT AND

STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND MULTI

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.052
AGENCY COORDINATION -- SO I

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:11.353
THINK THERE'S BEEN INTERESTS OF

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:12.988
PROGRESS MADE IN IMPROVING THE

01:18:13.055 --> 01:18:15.657
PROGRAM BUT I THINK USING THAT

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:17.125
INFORMATION TO INFORM.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.360
I'M WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.295
WANTS TO DO I THINK ONE OF THE

01:18:20.362 --> 01:18:22.931
REASONS AND THE CHALLENGES -- IS

01:18:22.998 --> 01:18:24.566
THAT IT REALLY TAKES A LOT.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.334
A AND AND BEING MINDFUL OF THE

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:28.937
IMPACTS TO THOSE THAT WE SERVE

01:18:29.004 --> 01:18:30.138
THE COMMUNITY BASED

01:18:30.205 --> 01:18:31.206
ORGANIZATIONS.

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.541
OF THOSE THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:33.909
PROVIDE THE SERVICES TO TO

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:36.011
VICTIMS -- AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:18:36.078 --> 01:18:40.816
WE ARE SENSITIVE TO ALL THE

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:43.618
DETAILS AGO INTO CONSOLIDATION.

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:44.553
I AM I WOULD AGREE AND I THINK

01:18:44.619 --> 01:18:45.887
THAT'S I'M GONNA UNDERPINS THE

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:46.721
ARE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:49.825
NOT MOVE QUICKLY TO TO

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:51.593
CONSOLIDATION -- RECOGNIZING

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.229
THAT THIS REPORT WAS DUE TO THE

01:18:54.296 --> 01:18:55.497
GOVERNOR AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:58.600
FINANCE IN OCTOBER AFTER IT JULY

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.235
FIFTEENTH -- BUDGET IS A VER

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:02.270
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO REALLY

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:04.239
ADEQUATELY EXAMINED HOW

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:05.740
CONSOLIDATION MIGHT ACTUALLY

01:19:05.807 --> 01:19:08.343
OCCUR SO MANY DETAILS BECAUSE

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:09.211
BOTH OF US.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:11.646
RECEIVE SO MUCH FEDERAL FUNDING

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.316
THROUGH DIFFERENT -- ENTITIES

01:19:14.382 --> 01:19:15.817
WITHIN.

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:17.853
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- UP AND

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.554
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE I'M SO

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:21.490
IS A LOT OF DETAILS THAT NEED TO

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.458
BE WORKED OUT AND WE WERE

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:27.229
SENSITIVE TO THAT -- AND THE

01:19:27.295 --> 01:19:29.331
POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ANY DELAYS

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.633
IN FUNDING BECAUSE OF

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:33.802
TRANSITIONING OR GRANT AWARDS

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.604

MY BECAUSE OUR STAKEHOLDERS.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.207
THAT'S WHY I IN THE AYE AYE

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:40.675
DETAIL THE RECOMMENDATION OF

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:41.843
SAYS THIS REALLY OUGHT TO BE

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.079
STUDIED MORE AND ARGO THROUGH

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:46.548
EITHER GOVERNOR'S REORGANIZATION

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.917
PLAN OR A LEGISLATIVE -- CHANGE

01:19:48.984 --> 01:19:50.452
AND THAT THAT IS PROBABLY GOING

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:51.686
TO TAKE SOME TIME.

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.221
NOT PUTTING THEIR SPECIFIC TIME

01:19:53.288 --> 01:19:55.690
FRAME ON IT BUT AS AS GRACE AS

01:19:55.757 --> 01:20:02.330
INDICATED IN THE SHORTER TERM.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:02.964
NOT WAITING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:05.033
WE HAVE REALLY RAMPED UP OUR

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:06.201
EFFORTS. TO TO COORDINATE OUR

01:20:06.268 --> 01:20:08.170
ACTIVITIES IN A MORE VISIBLE

01:20:08.236 --> 01:20:10.172
MORE TRANSPARENT WAY SO THAT

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:12.107
VICTIMS AND THE OTHER

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.642
STAKEHOLDERS TO ADMINISTER

01:20:13.708 --> 01:20:14.609
PROGRAMS.

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:15.911
REALLY KNOW THAT THE STATE OF

01:20:15.977 --> 01:20:18.813
CALIFORNIA IS UNITED ON THIS AND

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.315
THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:21.883
LEGISLATURE ARE COMMITTED TO

01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:23.418
DELIVERING THE BEST SERVICS

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.119
POSSIBLE.

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:25.654
SO WHETHER IT LOOKS A LITTLE

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:26.855
MESSY BECAUSE IT'S IN TWO

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.658
DIFFERENT PLACES WE'RE TRYING --

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:31.326
TO PRESENT AND PROVIDE THESE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:33.094
PROGRAMS IN KIND OF A A SEAMLESS

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.263
MANNER SO THAT WHATEVER OUR

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.133
ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES DON'T

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:38.667
BECOME A CHALLENGE OF THE

01:20:38.733 --> 01:20:39.434
VICTIMS.

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:41.336
SO WHEN YOU MERGING DEPARTMENT

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:42.804
WITH ANOTHER DEPARTMENT YOU HAVE.

01:20:42.871 --> 01:20:45.407
HOPEFULLY THE ELIMINATION OF

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:46.608
DUPLICATE POSITIONS.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.109
THE HOUSE AT BEING ADDRESSED

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.778
WELL THOSE ARE THE VERY KEY

01:20:49.844 --> 01:20:51.246
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:53.148
THERE'S ISSUES OF ACCOUNTING

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.050
SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES SYSTEMS

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.619
AND H. R. OFFICES AND ALL THE

01:20:57.686 --> 01:20:59.221
THINGS THAT ARE IN -- TO

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.489
DEPARTMENTS -- SO THOSE WILL ALL

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:02.724
BE ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE LOOKED

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:03.658
AT AND THEY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:06.094
CAREFULLY AND REALLY PLANNED OUT.

01:21:06.161 --> 01:21:07.429
AND NOT JUST ASSUME THAT WE'RE

01:21:07.495 --> 01:21:09.030
GOING TO BE ABLE TO TO DO IT

01:21:09.097 --> 01:21:11.032
WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS WE REALLY

01:21:11.099 --> 01:21:11.866
WANT TO PLAN IT OUT PLAN IT OUT

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:12.701
WELL.

01:21:12.767 --> 01:21:17.973
ARE YOU BOTH USING THIS CAL YES

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.140
WE ARE AS I WORKING FOR YOU

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:19.441
[inaudible]

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.409
IT'S WORKING.

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:23.278
YES WE WERE WE WERE ACTUALLY ONE

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.646
OF THE OF THE FIRST FIRMS WERE

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:25.313
IN WAVE.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.750
ONE AND THE WE'RE DOING FINE

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.518
THAT'S FOR THEIR SAKE YOU THANK

01:21:30.585 --> 01:21:31.319
YOU MADAM CHAIR [inaudible]

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.120
I'M [inaudible]

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:34.122
SO THE IT WAS THE BUDGET ACTION

01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:35.724
OF LAST YEAR.

01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:39.094
THAT DIRECTED THIS -- WERE --

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.495
DELIBERATE EFFORT TOWARDS

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:41.896
CONSOLIDATION.

01:21:41.963 --> 01:21:44.165
AND WHILE IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:45.267
CASE THAT.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.701
YOU KNOW THESE THINGS CAN'T JUST

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:47.702
BE DONE OVERNIGHT.

01:21:47.769 --> 01:21:49.471
THE WHY I RE ITERATED THE

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:50.939
EXPECTATION OF THE REPORT BY

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:53.608
DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN IS

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:53.908
CERTAINLY.

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:55.744
A THAT'S MORE THAN A YEAR AND A

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.445
HALF.

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.980
YOU KNOW THAT WE OUGHT TO BE

01:21:59.047 --> 01:22:02.150
ABLE -- TO THE IF WE WERE TRYING

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:04.185
TO CONSOLIDATE. TWO DEPARTMENTS

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:05.754
THAT WERE.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:08.456
DOUBLE OR TRIPLE YOUR SIZED.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:12.160
I'D HAVE MORE OF A YOU KNOW

01:22:12.227 --> 01:22:13.128
MAYBE THAT COULD TAKE A FEW

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:16.197
YEARS AND YOU ALL DO SOME --

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:19.200
VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY.

01:22:19.267 --> 01:22:20.735
DETAILED WORK IN CLEARLY GET

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:21.836
GRANTS FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.271
BUT YOU'RE IN THE SCHEME OF

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.606
THINGS IN TERMS AGES ARE NOT

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.707
THAT LARGE SO.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.809
LET'S GET THE REPORT IN DECEMBER

01:22:27.876 --> 01:22:32.147
OF TWENTY NINETY IS LA -- HAVE

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.349
ANY COMMENT. ONE PERSON AT THE

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:35.717
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:36.484
JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK

01:22:36.551 --> 01:22:38.553
COMMENTS -- WE DO YOU THINK THIS

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.522
REPORT IS A GOOD FIRST STEP --

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:42.557
CLEARLY THE THE AGENCIES WENT TO

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:44.559
QUITE A BIT OF EFFORT TO DO

01:22:44.626 --> 01:22:51.833
OUTREACH TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHERS --

01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:53.668
IT DOES SEEM THAT YOU KNOW IT

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:54.135
THAT.

01:22:54.202 --> 01:22:55.403
ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW

01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:56.938
THIS WOUL HAPPEN IS IMPORTANT

01:22:57.005 --> 01:22:58.206
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITIES --

01:22:58.273 --> 01:22:59.474
HOWEVER WE DO THINK THAT THE

01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.709
MAIN LIMITATION HERE OF COURSE

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:02.143
IS THAT THERE'S A LACK OF

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:04.112
CLARITY ON EXACTLY WHAT WOULD

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.647
HAPPEN WITH THIS CONSOLIDATION

01:23:05.714 --> 01:23:07.649
WHERE WOULD GO -- WHEN IT WOULD

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.084
HAPPEN THOSE KINDS OF DETAILS SO

01:23:09.150 --> 01:23:10.385
WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.786
THAT DECEMBER REPORT WE THINK

01:23:11.853 --> 01:23:13.054
THAT'S CRITICAL ON TO MEET THE

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:14.289
REQUIREMENTS OF WHAT THE

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:16.791
LEGISLATURE ASKED -- FOR BOTH IN

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:17.559
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT LANGUAGE

01:23:17.625 --> 01:23:19.828
FIRST AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY IN

01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:20.929
BUDGET BILLING WHICH SHOWED THAT

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:21.963
THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IT

01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:23.598
CLEAR A COUPLE OF TIMES THAT

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:24.933
THIS IS SOMETHING.

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:26.668
THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR THEM TO

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:27.802
TO HAVE A REPORT ON SO WE THINK

01:23:27.869 --> 01:23:30.271
WE THINK THAT DECEMBER REPORT IS

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:31.940
REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND WHEN THE

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:33.007
THE LEGISLATURE DOES REVIEW THAT

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.976
REPORT WE CONTINUE TO THINK IT'S

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:36.277
IMPORTANT TO HAVE ONE ENTITY

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:37.679
REALLY FOCUSED ON VICTIMS

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.848
PROGRAMS AND SO -- SO WE'RE

01:23:39.914 --> 01:23:41.316
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THAT --

01:23:41.383 --> 01:23:42.617
AND AND HOW THAT MIGHT HAPPEN

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:44.452
WITHIN THAT REPORT -- ALSO JUST

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:45.720
IN TERMS OF THAT THE SHORT TERM

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.322
RECOMMENDATIONS CERTAINLY SEEMS

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.590
REASONABLE TO DO SOME SOME INNER

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:50.992
ON THINGS AND AND GENERALLY SEEM

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.627
REASONABLE JUST ONE WHAT KIND OF

01:23:52.694 --> 01:23:55.230
ISSUE THAT TO THINK ABOUT IS --

01:23:55.296 --> 01:23:55.864
AND POTENTIALLY AS THE

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:56.631
DEPARTMENTS AS IF THERE ANY

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:57.899
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.567
THOSE INTERIM SUCH SOLUTIONS

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:01.236
BECAUSE REALLY WE VIEW THOSE AS

01:24:01.302 --> 01:24:03.304
INTERIM SOLUTIONS AND SO -- IF

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.839
THEY ARE IF THERE ARE COSTS

01:24:04.906 --> 01:24:08.343
ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE -- THAT

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:08.977
SHOULD BE PROBABLY WAIT IN THAT

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.178
CONTEXT.

01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:11.346
I'M CHAIR IF I MAY I JUST HAVE

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.214
TO REITERATE THAT THE THE

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:14.149
DECEMBER REPORT IS A

01:24:14.215 --> 01:24:16.217
RECOMMENDATION FROM THE WORKING

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.419
GROUP BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:18.887
NECESSARILY COMMITMENT FROM THE

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.488
ADMINISTRATION NOT A REPORT WILL

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:22.056
BE PROVIDED I THINK WE'RE STILL

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:23.558
LOOKING AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:24:23.625 --> 01:24:25.560
AND WORKING WITH THEM -- BUT

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:26.661
AGAIN I DON'T THINK THERE IS

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.263
LIKE COMMITMENTS THOUGHT THAT WE

01:24:28.329 --> 01:24:29.497
WILL BE DOING OVER POOR IN

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.765
DECEMBER BUT IT THIS IS A VERY

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:32.801
IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR US AND WE

01:24:32.867 --> 01:24:33.301
ARE WORKING WITH BOTH

01:24:33.368 --> 01:24:33.968
DEPARTMENTS.

01:24:34.035 --> 01:24:36.571
DILIGENTLY ON THIS SO -- WE WILL

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.339
PROVIDE INFORMATION AS MUCH AS

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.741
WE CAN BUT AGAIN THERE'S NO

01:24:39.808 --> 01:24:41.543
COMMITMENT TO A DECEMBER REPORT

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:42.610
FROM THE MINISTRATION.

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:45.380
RIGHT SO WHILE IT IS NOT IN THE

01:24:45.447 --> 01:24:47.048
BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT GAVE

01:24:47.115 --> 01:24:47.882
THE DIRECTION TO DO THE

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.551
CONSOLIDATION DID NOT SPECIFY

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:51.252
DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN WITH

01:24:51.319 --> 01:24:52.754
THE REPORTED DID OCTOBER

01:24:52.821 --> 01:24:58.059
EIGHTEEN WHICH WE HAVE -- A

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:00.028
GIVEN THAT OUR INTEREST IS IN

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.663
DOING THE CONSOLIDATION.

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.665
BY MY REITERATING THE DESIRE FOR

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:06.234
THAT IT GIVES US THE ABILITY

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:06.534
[inaudible]

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:10.171
IN THE RURAL THAT BE THE END OF

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:14.609
THE NINETEEN NO THE TWENTY

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.811
TWENTY ONE YEAR. TO BE ABLE TO

01:25:16.878 --> 01:25:20.014
ADOPT A BUDGET THAT REFLECTS.

01:25:20.081 --> 01:25:21.716
A CONSOLIDATION.

01:25:21.783 --> 01:25:23.585
AND WITHOUT SO IT WILL MAKE IT

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:24.352
VERY DIFFICULT TO DO SO.

01:25:24.419 --> 01:25:26.287
SO.

01:25:26.354 --> 01:25:28.990
IF ARM WE'LL GO BACK AND LOOK AT

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:30.525
THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILL

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:31.826
FROM BEFORE.

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:34.062
AND IF WE WERE NOT CLEAR ABOUT

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:34.996
SOME DATES MAY WILL PUT SOME IN

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:37.599
THIS YEAR.

01:25:37.665 --> 01:25:40.001
AN GO AHEAD SENATOR MORE LACK.

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:41.836
GREAT BECAUSE THERE'S A BIG

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.605
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A SUGGESTION

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:45.340
AND IN ORDER.

01:25:45.406 --> 01:25:48.209
AND I'M I'M HERE IN ORDER. TO SO

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:49.844
I'M JUST WONDERING JUST THE

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.112
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH WITH

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:53.014
NOVEMBER WORK OUT BETTER FOR YOU

01:25:53.081 --> 01:25:55.083
TO GET IT DONE. FOR OCTOBER WAS

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:56.618
IT WOULD YOU PREFER THAT I THINK

01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:58.920
WE STILL NEED TO WORK WITHIN THE

01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.721
NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:02.357
DEPARTMENT'S BUT AS ALWAYS --

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:03.625
THE BEST REPORTING TIME FOR

01:33:16.190 --> 01:33:17.558
THE AMOUNT THAT'S BEEN QUESTED

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.460
HERE'S TWO POINT TWO MILLION AND

01:33:19.527 --> 01:33:20.861
THAT'S THE EXACT AMOUNT THAT'S

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.163
NEEDED.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.432
FOR THE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:27.134

BECAUSE I WAS ON THE CITY

01:44:20.988 --> 01:44:23.056

TUNNEL FIRE.

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:28.729
AND ONE OF THE WHILE IT MOVED

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:30.697
VERY FAST AND WOULD HAVE HAD

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.566
REALLY DAMAGING CONSEQUENCES

01:44:32.633 --> 01:44:34.835

OUR AGENCIES COULD NOT

01:44:53.253 --> 01:44:54.688

01:46:15.969 --> 01:46:19.072
AND AND AS FAR AWAY AS OVERSEAS --

01:46:19.139 --> 01:46:20.474
THE INTEROPERABLE CONSTANT WAS

01:46:20.540 --> 01:46:21.975
NOT AN ISSUE.

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:22.976
OF FOR YOU THAT WAS NOT

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:24.444

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:05.051
EARLY ON TO BUILD THE LOCAL

01:47:05.118 --> 01:47:08.488
NETWORK CITY SABIR X. LA RICK'S --

THERE'S A LONG TERM

01:47:15.762 --> 01:47:17.164
STRATEGICALLY YOU'RE ABLE TO

SUBSCRIBING AND IT'S A VERY.

01:47:22.803 --> 01:47:24.337
SEAMLESS INTERFACE AT THAT POINT

01:47:24.404 --> 01:47:27.674
ONCE YOU'VE BUILT -- THAT THAT --

01:47:27.741 --> 01:47:29.843
TECHNOLOGICAL CONNECTION.

01:48:11.551 --> 01:48:27.300
WORKLOAD MIGHT BE SO.

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:28.435
ESSENTIALLY -- THERE MIGHT BE

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:31.404

WORKLOAD TO BUILD THE SIZE

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.381
SYSTEM MIGHT BE DIFFERENT.

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:44.217
FROM THE LEVEL REQUIRED TO

INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS

AMADOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

01:52:29.642 --> 01:52:30.977
JUST WANT TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF

01:52:31.044 --> 01:52:32.445
CLARIFICATION BASED ON THE STAFF

01:52:32.512 --> 01:52:34.314
CAUGHT RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THE

FUNDING THAT THEY RECEIVED -- IN

01:52:36.316 --> 01:52:38.084
THE BUDGET ACTIVE TWENTY

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:39.719
EIGHTEEN THEY RECEIVED AT TWENTY

01:52:39.786 --> 01:52:40.920
FIVE MILLION OF GREENHOUSE GAS

01:52:40.987 --> 01:52:42.989
REDUCTION FUND -- IT HAS TAKEN A

01:52:43.056 --> 01:52:44.357
LITTLE BIT OF TIME -- FOR YES TO

01:52:44.424 --> 01:52:45.692
SPEND THAT DOWN I THINK THERE'S

01:52:45.758 --> 01:52:46.759
A LITTLE BIT MORE STRICTER

01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:48.061
REQUIREMENTS WHEN USING G. G. R.

01:52:48.128 --> 01:52:48.761
F..

01:52:48.828 --> 01:52:50.263
IT WAS LIMITED I BELIEVED ONLY

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:53.099
FIRE HAZARDS NOT ALL HAZARDS --

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.367
SO IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:55.502
CHALLENGING BUT THEY ARE WORKING

01:52:55.568 --> 01:52:56.836
THROUGH IT AND STARTING TO SPEND

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:59.105
IT DOWN -- IN THE BUDGET ACT OF

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:01.274
THIS YEAR THERE IS A TWENTY FIVE

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:02.342
MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED A

01:53:02.408 --> 01:53:04.777
GENERAL FUND AND FOR THE FIRST

01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:07.180
SIX MONTHS OR SO IT WAS -- USED

01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:09.883
TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT AND TOOLS --

01:53:09.949 --> 01:53:11.417
BUT THEN SB NINE OH ONE WHICH

01:53:11.484 --> 01:53:13.119
BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST

01:53:13.186 --> 01:53:15.321
CHANGE THAT PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

01:53:15.388 --> 01:53:17.390
TO ALLOW THEM TO USE IT FOR PRE

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:18.892
POSITIONING FOR ALL HAZARDS.

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:20.493
SO YES REALLY ONLY HAS SIX

01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.029
MONTHS REALLY TO SPEND THAT

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:27.000
MONEY ON PRE POSITIONING -- AND

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:27.667
WE THINK THAT THESE THESE

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.402
RESOURCES ARE CRUCIAL THEY DO

01:53:29.469 --> 01:53:31.337
HELP WITH RESPONDING TO ALL

01:53:31.404 --> 01:53:32.672
TYPES OF HAZARDS OF FOR PRE

01:53:32.739 --> 01:53:35.008
POSITIONING OUR RESOURCES AND SO

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:36.042
WE DO THINK THAT TWENTY FIVE

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.709
MILLION.

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:40.847
AND CONTINUING UP INVESTMENT IN

01:53:40.914 --> 01:53:42.615
THAT -- IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:43.249
WELL THE COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:46.486
THAT -- AGAIN JUST THIS IS IN

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:50.790
GENERAL FUND THIS IS THE BUT HAS

01:53:50.857 --> 01:53:53.059
LOTS OF COMPETITION AND WHILE I

01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:55.662
THINK THERE'S CLEARLY SOME CLEAR

01:53:55.728 --> 01:53:57.330
NEEDS IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:53:57.397 --> 01:53:58.364
OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE THEM AN

01:53:58.431 --> 01:53:59.566
INCREASE.

01:53:59.632 --> 01:54:02.268
IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE TO IT

01:54:02.335 --> 01:54:03.836
WHERE YOU MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO

01:54:03.903 --> 01:54:07.440
MODIFY IT BECAUSE JUST THE IF

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:11.277
YOU KNOW DEPARTMENTS ABILITY. TO

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:12.679
TO SPEND THE FINES.

01:54:12.745 --> 01:54:15.381
WITHIN TIME PERIOD SO I THINK

01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:17.817
WHAT WE'D WANT TO DO AND ALL ON

01:54:17.884 --> 01:54:19.786
THE LA -- NEXT BUT WHAT WE'D

01:54:19.852 --> 01:54:22.188
WANT TO DO IS HOLD THIS OPEN

01:54:22.255 --> 01:54:22.488
[inaudible]

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:25.925
AND SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A BETTER

01:54:25.992 --> 01:54:27.293
ASSESSMENT.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.761
OF WHAT THE NEED IS CLOSER TO

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:30.630
THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND A

01:54:30.697 --> 01:54:32.632
B. C. P. ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:33.233
SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT

01:54:33.299 --> 01:54:34.300
NOW [inaudible]

01:54:34.367 --> 01:54:38.538
I'M -- A DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT.

01:54:38.605 --> 01:54:40.173
THAT'S EXACTLY IN LINE WITH OUR

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:42.108
COMMENTS AND WE DID KNOW BOTH

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:43.309
FOR THIS ITEM IN THE NEXT ITEM

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:45.011
THAT -- WILL BE HEARD I BELIEVE

01:54:45.078 --> 01:54:46.446
THAT THERE WEREN'T BC PIECES

01:54:46.512 --> 01:54:47.380
THERE WASN'T THE KIND OF

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:48.781
INFORMATION THAT WOULD TYPICALLY

01:54:48.848 --> 01:54:51.784
RECEIVE ON A PROPOSAL -- AND ONE

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.653
SPECIFIC TYPE OF INFORMATION

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.088
THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IS IS A

01:54:55.154 --> 01:54:55.755
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE ON

01:54:55.822 --> 01:54:57.290
GOING NEED CERTAINLY PRE

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:59.325
POSITIONING -- SEEMS LIKE HAS A

01:54:59.392 --> 01:54:59.959
LOT OF VALUE IN CAN MAKE A LOT

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:02.028
OF SENSE I'M AS WAS MENTIONED BY

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:03.563
IDEA LAUGH -- THAT THE

01:55:03.630 --> 01:55:05.431
DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN -- A LITTLE

01:55:05.498 --> 01:55:06.833
BIT SLOWER GETTING THIS OUT NO

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:08.434
COURSE THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM SO

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:09.969
SOME OF THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED --

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:11.137
IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THEY SPEND

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:13.339
APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION IN

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:13.906
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO FAR ONE

01:55:13.973 --> 01:55:15.441
POINT FIVE SO IT'S JUST

01:55:15.508 --> 01:55:16.809
UNCERTAIN WHETHER TWENTY FIVE

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:17.977
MILLION IS RIGHT ABOUT MAYBE IT

01:55:18.044 --> 01:55:18.611
SHOULD BE MORE MAYBE SHOULD BE

01:55:18.678 --> 01:55:20.613
LESS -- SO IT SEEMS LIKE A

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.382
PRUDENT APPROACH -- TO PROVIDE A

01:55:22.448 --> 01:55:26.286
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME FOR FOR A

01:55:26.352 --> 01:55:28.154
MORE THOROUGH ASSESSMENT.

01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:28.855
MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY REALLY

01:55:28.921 --> 01:55:29.822
QUICK I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:55:29.889 --> 01:55:30.423
WE'RE CLEAR THAT THE THE MONEY

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:31.024
THAT'S PROPOSE FOR THE

01:55:31.090 --> 01:55:32.692
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS A GENERAL

01:55:32.759 --> 01:55:34.260
FUND ONGOING COMMITMENT NOT.

01:55:34.327 --> 01:55:36.195
YEAH IT IS ONGOING AND I THINK

01:55:36.262 --> 01:55:38.164
JUST TOUCH ON THE BCP QUESTION I

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:39.265
THINK THE REASON WE DIDN'T

01:55:39.332 --> 01:55:41.134
PREPARE ONE FOR THE SPECIFICALLY

01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.302
AND THE NEXT ONE THAT -- MISS

01:55:42.368 --> 01:55:43.903
CHRISTINE MENTION IS BECAUSE

01:55:43.970 --> 01:55:45.171
THESE WERE ALLEGED COMMITMENTS

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:46.339
FROM LAST YEAR AND THAT WE'RE

01:55:46.406 --> 01:55:48.474
JUST COMMITTING ON GOING FUNDING

01:55:48.541 --> 01:55:49.709
FOR THESE PURPOSES.

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:51.444
AND SO -- I THINK THAT'S WHY WE

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:53.012
DIDN'T DO IT BUT YEAH THIS IS A

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:54.247
GENERAL FUND.

01:55:54.314 --> 01:55:55.515
PROPOSAL FOR THE BUDGET.

01:55:55.581 --> 01:55:57.817
THAT CLARIFICATION BY THINK WE

01:55:57.884 --> 01:56:01.521
pA B. C. P. ON IT JUST BECAUSE

01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:02.989
WHILE I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO

01:56:03.056 --> 01:56:04.057
UNDERMINE THE LEGISLATIVE

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.191
DIRECTION.

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:07.560
IF WE KNOW THAT WE WOULD ONLY BE

01:56:07.627 --> 01:56:09.595
ABLE TO SPEND.

01:56:09.662 --> 01:56:10.963
BOBBY -- I'M FROM PEOPLE

01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:12.165

YEAR NUMBER RIGHT NOW TEN

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:15.568
MILLION IN THAT NEXT FISCAL YEAR

01:56:15.635 --> 01:56:17.036
THEN WE'D WANT TO ONLY

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:18.271
APPROPRIATE THAT AMOUNT.

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.739
SO ANY QUESTION OR COMMENT

01:56:19.806 --> 01:56:21.674

FLOODING IN THE BURN SCARS A

01:57:16.529 --> 01:57:18.231

TO AN EMERGENCY AND THE SUCCESS

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:42.588
RATE IS A LOT BETTER THAN HAVING

[inaudible]

02:10:50.809 --> 02:10:52.811
I'M.

BUT I'M ASSUMING THAT IN THAT.

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.782
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MONEY

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:58.850
WAS WELL MAYBE IT WAS A RE

02:10:58.917 --> 02:11:00.352
PROCREATIVE BUT THE FOLLOWING

02:11:00.419 --> 02:11:01.486
YEAR WE DID GIVE THAT A FIVE

02:11:01.553 --> 02:11:02.754

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:14.866
MILLION RIGHT.

02:11:14.933 --> 02:11:16.101
WOULD WICH MIGHT OF AND I

02:11:16.168 --> 02:11:17.536
CANNOT REMEMBER MIGHT HAVE

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:19.438
REFLECTED THAT THERE WERE SOME

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:21.740
UNUSED FUNDS.

02:11:21.807 --> 02:11:23.775
AT I'M NOT SURE OKAY OKAY.

02:11:23.842 --> 02:11:26.612
BUT IT THIS REQUEST IS TO

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:27.813
CONTINUE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING

02:11:27.879 --> 02:11:30.082
THAT WE INITIALLY APPROPRIATE IN

HERNIA DOESN'T HAVE THE CPT BUT

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:41.860
ANYWAY LA -- THAT WAS OUR MAIN

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:43.028
COMMON IS IS THIS WAS ANOTHER

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:44.096
ONE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE BC HE

02:11:44.162 --> 02:11:45.797
WAS A CONTINUATION OF CERTAINLY

02:11:45.864 --> 02:11:46.932
SOME AUGMENTATIONS LEGISLATURE'S

02:11:46.999 --> 02:11:47.866
MADE IN PAST YEARS -- ONE POINT

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:51.069
THAT WE WOULD MAKE ON ON THIS

02:11:51.136 --> 02:11:52.638
APPROACH SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES

02:11:52.704 --> 02:11:54.273
ON THAT MIGHT BE -- ENVISIONED

02:11:54.339 --> 02:11:55.374
AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:56.341
POTENTIALLY COULD ALSO BE

02:11:56.408 --> 02:11:58.176
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL FUNDS

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:58.810
THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES A. B.

02:11:58.877 --> 02:12:00.279
C. P. COULD.

02:12:00.345 --> 02:12:01.680
COULD HELP OUTLINED -- THERE ARE

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:04.549
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES THAT ARE

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:05.751
EXPECTED IN FEDERAL FUNDS.

02:12:05.817 --> 02:12:06.952
OR DO WE THAT THE STATE ACTUALLY

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.153
JUST RECEIVED RECENTLY ON

02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:10.022
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE VICTIMS OF

02:12:10.088 --> 02:12:11.456
CRIME ACT FUNDS.

02:12:11.523 --> 02:12:12.658
ARE THE STATE LAST YEAR HAD

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:13.792
ABOUT GOT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

02:12:13.859 --> 02:12:15.527
MILLION A LITTLE OVER TWO

02:12:15.594 --> 02:12:16.328
HUNDRED MILLION THIS YEAR I'M

02:12:16.395 --> 02:12:17.729

TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALLOCATION

02:12:18.430 --> 02:12:20.065
WAS ALMOST DOUBLE THAT IT WAS

02:12:20.132 --> 02:12:21.166
ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION SO

02:12:21.233 --> 02:12:22.301
THERE IS A REALLY SUBSTANTIAL

02:12:22.367 --> 02:12:23.602
INCREASE IN FUNDING ON THE

02:12:23.669 --> 02:12:25.704
FEDERAL SIDE THAT CAN BE USED

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:26.271

LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION AND

02:12:33.045 --> 02:12:33.545
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING WE

02:12:33.612 --> 02:12:34.579
THINK A COULD BE CONSIDERED AS A

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:38.984
FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS TYPE OF

02:12:39.051 --> 02:12:39.885
ACTIVITY.

02:12:39.951 --> 02:12:40.385
WELL WE COULD ALWAYS IN.

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:41.486
THE FINAL.

02:12:41.553 --> 02:12:46.024
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

FEDERAL IN OTHER SOURCES OF

02:13:42.514 --> 02:13:43.815
TICKETS.

02:13:43.882 --> 02:13:45.150
PULLED INTO THAT TRACKING IS

02:13:45.217 --> 02:13:48.620
BECAUSE OF LACK OF RESOURCES

02:13:48.687 --> 02:13:53.625
