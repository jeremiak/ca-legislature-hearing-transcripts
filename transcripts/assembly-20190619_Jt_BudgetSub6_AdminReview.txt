WELCOME THANKS FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] SOMEONE [inaudible] RANGED. GOOD MORNING I THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY -- MY NAME IS MERRIAM BARCELONA ENGINE YOU KNOW AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIA. AND I'M NOT SURE HE WANTED INTRODUCTIONS AROUND THE REST OF THE TABLE OR YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT GOOD MORNING RICHARD GILL AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING GEORGE LE LET'S CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. FRANCISCO LANA WHETHER DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY AND BRIAN METZGER WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION AS WELL. AS ALL OF YOU ARE AWARENESS AS THE CHAIR WOMAN HAS STATED -- THAT FITS GALA IS ONE OF THE LARGEST I. T. UNDERTAKINGS THAT THE STATE HAS. EVER TAKEN AND WE HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW THE THE ORIGINAL FSR WENT OUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHEN WE STARTED AS JUST A REPLACEMENT OF THE BUDGETING SYSTEM. IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WITH AN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE REPLACEMENT OF LEGACY SYSTEMS THAT WORK THE CONTROLLERS THE TREASURER'S THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A SYSTEMS SO AS THE PROJECT YOU KNOW EXPANDED SO DID SCOPE -- AS WELL AS AS COSTS AND IT HAS FLUCTUATED OVER THE YEARS AS THAT SCOPE CONTINUE TO CHANGE AND I JUST AS WE GOT MORE INTO THE INTO THE PROJECT. WE HIRED OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATOR IN TWENTY TWELVE AND SO THAT IS THE OFFICIAL. BOOTS ON THE GROUND STARTING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROJECT. AND SINCE THEN I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT WE HAVE FULLY DEPLOYED THE BUDGETING SOLUTION FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE BUDGET THAT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU BY THE GOVERNOR THIS YEAR WAS PRODUCED AS HAS EVERY BUDGET SINCE. TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH THE INFORMATION IN THE HYPERION SYSTEM SO THE DEPARTMENT'S INPUT AT THE INFORMATION DIRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM AND ULTIMATELY PUT TOGETHER A A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WHAT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT SENSE THE -- ON SINCE THE RELEASE OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM FROM THE BUDGETING PERSPECTIVE. IS THAT THE ENACTED BUDGET NOW IT HAS THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL AS THE PROPOSED BUDGET. SO THAT PROPOSED BUDGET AS WE ALL KNOW IS THAT INITIAL POLICY STATEMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR. BUT IT'S ONLY AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE ITS WORK ALLEN'S THE GOVERNOR HAS ULTIMATELY SIGNED AND AND DONE ANY LINE ITEM ADJUSTMENTS TO IT. THAT IT IS THE THE LAW OF THE LAND THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL HAD NEVER BEEN AVAILABLE TO ADD THE LEGISLATURE OR TO THE PUBLIC IN AN EASY TO USE FASHION SO WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THAT -- ACHIEVEMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM AND WITH THE DEPARTMENTS THAT WE HAVE IN THE SYSTEM HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS. WE HAVE ABOUT DOING ACCOUNTING WE HAVE A THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES THAT RUN FOR OUR SYSTEM TODAY. WE HAVE -- THAT THE BANKING TRANSACTIONS ARE FULLY DEPLOYED SO THE CASH MANAGEMENT FUNCTION FROM THE TREASURER'S PERSPECTIVE -- IS DEPLOYED AND THEY MANAGE TO TRILLION DOLLARS OF BANKING TRANSACTIONS A YEAR NOW UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM. AND THAT IS WITH -- EIGHT LARGE BANKS AND ALL OF THE INTERNAL. BORROWING AND AND FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS CASH TRANSACTIONS THAT HAPPENED IN THE SYSTEM. LIKE I SAID THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS AND THAT TRANSLATES INTO IN THE ACCOUNTING PIECE WHICH IS ALSO DEPLOYED THE DEPARTMENTAL ACCOUNTING PEACE HAS BEEN DEPLOYED TO THESE DEPARTMENTS. IT REPRESENTS THAT WE HAVE EIGHTEEN I'M CLOSER ACTUALLY. TO TWENTY THOUSAND END USERS UTILIZING THE SYSTEM TODAY. THAT REPRESENTS ABOUT 8% OF THE TOTAL STATE EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE. SO NOT ONLY IS FISCALE ONE OF THE LARGEST I. T. UNDERTAKINGS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT WE HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA DOES BUSINESS AND FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY EIGHTEEN THOUSAND END USERS DO THEIR DAY TO DAY WORK. SO -- IN THE OTHER SORRY THE OTHER PIECE OF FUNCTIONALITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN FULLY DEPLOYED IN CAME OUT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OF COURSE. IS THE PROCUREMENT PIECE SO WE RETIRED THE LEGACY BID SYNC SYSTEM THAT CONTRACTORS UTILIZED -- TO TO SELL GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE NOW UTILIZE -- CALLIE PROCURE WHICH IS A SYSTEM RUN OUT WITH. ON TOP OF THAT THE PEOPLE SOFT SYSTEM WE HAVE NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND VENDORS THAT SELL. GOODS AND SERVICES TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGH THE DEPLOYMENT OF CALLIE PROCURE WE WERE ABLE TO WE THIS IS RIGHT AWAY MY MY PARTNER SAID TGS IN THIS CASE WAS ABLE TO CERTIFY SMALL BUSINESSES -- SB DVD SO DISABLE BUSINESS VETERAN ENTERPRISES UTILIZING THE SYSTEM SO THAT. IS AN EASE OF ARM AND BIGGER ACCESS POINT FOR THE SMALLER. COMPANIES AND SO THAT AGAIN IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE INCREDIBLY -- PROUD OF D. WITH RESPECT -- TO FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE'VE NEVER HAD BEFORE -- WE'VE HAD THE ABILITY SENSE THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE. TO ENFORCE THE UNDERLYING RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT EXIST IN THE STATE WITH RESPECT TO ACCOUNTING BUDGETING AND AND OTHER FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. SO THESE SYSTEM THAT DEPARTMENTS OPERATED IT AND YOU'RE WERE REQUIRED UNDER THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE MANUAL OR OTHER REGULATION TO DO CERTAIN THINGS. BY COMBINING ALL OF THE SYSTEMS INTO A SINGLE INTEGRATED SOLUTION. THE DEPARTMENTS AT THE COMPUTER IS THAT CHECK FOR THE CONTROL AGENCIES SO BEFORE YOU CAN. MAKE AN EXPENDITURE OUT OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM TAX DO YOU HAVE APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY. YOU'RE ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO SPEND ONLY IF YOU HAVE A PREPARATION PRETTY BUT THE THE BUT THE COMPUTER IS NOT FORGIVING. THEN WHEN YOU GO TO ACTUALLY MAKE AN EXPENDITURE DO YOU HAVE CASH IN THAT ACCOUNT. AT THIS MOMENT WHEN THE MONEY NEEDS TO BE THERE AGAIN THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM. SOME OF THE STRUGGLES THAT -- WE'VE HAD. FOR SOME OF THE DEPARTMENTS. OUR OUR INTO THAT FACT THAT SOME OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY NEEDED TO BE DOING. ARE NOW ALL HAPPENING IN REAL TIME IN IN THIS SINGLE SYSTEM SO YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD -- I DID A DAY DELAY BETWEEN WHEN YOU YOU'RE RIGHT YOUR CHECK TO WHEN IT GETS DEPOSITED -- OR CASH IT AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE SO MUCH AND AND NOT FISCAL TODAY SO IT'S MORE REAL TIME AND THEREFORE. AS THERE IS THAT UP FRONT WORK AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IS HAPPENING. I 98% OF ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT WE SET OUT TO BUILD. HAS BEEN BUILT. THE REMAINING FUNCTIONALITY WRITTEN REMAINS AROUND TO THE CASH BOOK OF RECORDS SO THE LEGACY -- SYSTEM AT THE AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHICH DOES THE CASH ACCOUNTING FOR THE STATE. NEEDS TO BE HAVE REPLICATED ALLEN TO PUT INTO A FIST CAL AND THAT IS WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IN THIS NEXT YEAR. WE DIVIDED IT THE INTEGRATED WE DIVIDED THE ASIO RELEASE IN. TWO FIVE MAJOR MILESTONES. AND THIS WAS AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF US. TRYING TO DO TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO BRING ON ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THE COMPTROLLER'S WE HAD MANY MEETINGS ALONG THE WAY AND ULTIMATELY THE FOUR PARTNERS DECIDED THAT. INSTEAD OF DOING A YOU KNOW BANDAID RIPOFF THE BAND AID APPROACH AND CUTTING OVER THE BOOK OF RECORD IN ALL OF THEIR OTHER FUNCTIONALITY ALL ONCE. WE DEVELOP SOMETHING CALLED THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION WHERE WE'RE INTERFACING. OUR SYSTEM WITH THE LEGACY SYSTEM SO THAT WE CAN COMPARE -- IN ON A DAILY BASIS WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS FULLY TESTED BEFORE WE START TURNING OFF THE LEGACY SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. SO AGAIN THE ONLY PIECES THAT ARE LEFT TO DEPLOY AND THAT REALLY ARE AROUND THE CASH MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE WE ARE QUITE A WAYS DOWN IN THE BUILDING. BUT BECAUSE AGAIN. IT. HAS A REQUIREMENT TO BE RELEASED ON THE BEGINNING A FISCAL YEAR TO HAVE TO GO JULY. ONE I CAN'T DO IT IN THE FIRST QUARTER THE SECOND QUARTER EVEN THOUGH WE MIGHT BE READY TO DEPLOY IT HAS TO COINCIDE WITH THE WITH THE CALENDAR YEAR SO THAT. THAT PIECE OF WORK IS IS AGAIN -- WORKING VERY WELL WITH WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND THEIR THEIR STAFF IN MAKING SURE THAT. IT IS BUILT BUT THEN IT IS ALSO FULLY TESTED AND VALIDATED BEFORE WE PUT IT INTO PRODUCTION FOR THE REST OF THE STATE. AND IN THE FINAL PIECE THAT IS LEFT TO BUILD. IS THE KAFFIR WHICH IS THE OKAY I HAVE TO ALWAYS READ THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS A KEY DOCUMENT THAT IS UTILIZED BY. BY THE RATING AGENCIES BUT ALSO BY OTHER INVESTORS AND STATE CALIFORNIA AND SO -- IT IS A KEY AN IMPORTANT DOCUMENT TO US AND WE WILL BE CONTINUING THAT BUILD AND DEPLOYMENT AS WELL IN THIS YEAR. SO HAVING SAID THAT ABOUT THE SYSTEM I WANT TO SHIFT A LITTLE BIT TO THE ACTUAL USE OF THE SYSTEM. SO HOW ARE THE DEPARTMENTS THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEM HOW ARE THEY THE FAIRING. SO FIRST -- ONE OF THE THE ISSUES THAT HAS COME UP IN THE CASF A AS WELL AS THE I PO AS WELL AS IN -- THE CONTROLLERS LETTER WAS THAT. THAT WOULD WE NEED TO NOT BRING ON ANYMORE DEPARTMENTS UNTIL WE'VE WE'VE KIND OF STATE LAST. ONE HAPPY TO SAY THAT ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS ARE ON THAT WE HAD INTENDED TO DO SO THAT IT WAS KIND OF A TIMING ISSUE WHEN WHEN WE GOT THAT LETTER WHEN WE WE DEPLOYED ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS. THE REMAINING DEPARTMENTS ON JULY. ONE TWENTY NINETEEN NOW THIS DEPLOYMENT EFFORT WAS VERY -- JULY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN SORRY WE'RE NOT THERE YET -- IS THAT THIS EFFORT WAS DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF OUR OTHER ON BOARDING EFFORTS IN THAT THIS REMAINING SIXTY FOUR I DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER CO COURTED DEPARTMENTS. TO DO THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT AND THE TASKS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN BRINGING THEM ON SO I WAS ABLE TO TAKE MY STAFF IN BED THEM WITH SOME OF THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS THE MORE COMPLICATED DEPARTMENTS. AND WORK WITH THEM SO THAT THEY COULD HAVE AN EASIER ON BOARDING THAN WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST. THIS HAS PAID DIVIDENDS IN THAT MANY OF THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE MADE THAT INVESTMENT IN UP FRONT. HAS BEEN ABLE -- TO KEEP UP WITH THEIR MINDS AND AT IS ARE FURTHER ALONG IN IN BETTER SHAPE THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN AT THIS POINT IN TIME FOR PREVIOUS RELEASES. NOW ONE DEPARTMENT THAT STICKS OUT IN MY MIND IS CAL FIRE AND AGAIN WHEN I SAY WE INDIVIDUALIZED AND WE WERE ABLE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY BECAUSE WE WEREN'T WORKING ON BRINGING ON THE NEXT CULL COURT. WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM THERE AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM AND KNOWING THAT JULY ONE MIGHT BE THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME TO CUT OVER FOR FINANCIAL RECORDS. IT IS ONE OF THE ABSOLUTE WORST TIMES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- TO MOVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION SO THEY'RE IN THE THE HEAT OF THE FIRE SEASON -- AND AND DOING THIS CHANGE MANAGEMENT IN THE MIDDLE WHEN THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO PAY THEIR BILLS. IT IT YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE EXPEDITED FASHION AND NOT HAVE THIS THIS CHANGE AND ROB THEM. SO WE DID A CONVERSION WITH THEM AND THEN IN JANUARY THEY STARTED TRANSACTING IN THE SYSTEM. SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BRING THEM. ALONG WITH US WORKING WITH THEM THEY'VE HAD AN INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT AND I I JUST I DO HAVE TO SING THE PRAISES OF OF CAL FIRE. BECAUSE IT WAS THIS MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW IMPORTANT THEIR CORE FUNCTIONS WORK AND WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE ABLE TO NOT MISS A BEAT WHEN THEY CAME ON TO OUR SYSTEM. I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THEY ARE ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT IS CURRENT SO THEY HAVE CLOSED NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE NINE MONTHS WE'RE EXPECTED TO HAVE CLOSED AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND I WILL YOU KNOW IGNORE ALL AGE THAT THEY'VE ONLY RECONCILED TO OF THOSE MONTHS BUT AGAIN THAT HAPPENS IT'S AN ACCOUNTING ACTIVITY OUTSIDE OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. THAT THEY DO -- ON THEIR OWN OR WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ADDITIONAL PAIN POINTS THAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD. IS DETAILS. SO INSTEAD OF DOING ON A HIGH LEVEL HAS SINGLE CLAIM AUDIT FOR UP -- FOR SINGLE CLAIM FOR A LOT OF INVOICES THEY'RE HAVING TO DO IT LINE ITEM. SO EACH LINE OF AN INVOICE GETS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM. AND THE REASON THAT IS IS BECAUSE THIS IS. THE AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY THAT WAS ONE OF THE KEY GOALS OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. REQUIRES THAT -- THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE SPENDING ON ON ON CRITICAL AREAS WE NEED TO HAVE IT. CAPTURED THAT WAY. THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT COIN IS DO WE COLLECT -- YOU KNOW DO WE NEED TO KNOW THAT THE PRISONS ARE BUYING. GALA APPLES OR GRANNY SMITH APPLES OR DO I NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE BUYING FOR IT. AND SO THIS IS A POLICY DISCUSSION THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND THEY'RE WORKING ON WHAT IS THE RIGHT LEVEL OF DETAIL TO BE CAPTURED. AND SO THAT. IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS YOU KNOW MORE PERFECT FOR THAT THE SECOND PANEL BUT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT ARE DEFINITELY DRIVING ADDITIONAL WORK. FOR THE DEPARTMENTS AND ON THE FLIP SIDE THE ADDITIONAL WORKON THE CONTROL AGENCY SIDE IS THAT. AGAIN WHEN WE WERE WE WOULD SEND AND WE GET IT RIGHT BE CONSIDERATE WE WOULD HAVE A SO BASICALLY IF A CONSOLIDATED -- DEPOSIT NOW THE DEPOSITS FOR EACH DEPARTMENT ARE EACH TRANSACTION HAVE ITS OWN LINE ITEM IN THERE SO WHERE'S THE CONTROLLERS WORKLOAD WENT FROM OKAY WE'VE GOT THIS DEPOSIT OF A MILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS HIGH LEVEL ACCOUNT. BECAUSE AGAIN THE CONTROLLERS AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF REPORTING IN THE FISCAL SYSTEM WANTED THIS MORE DETAILED LEVEL. WE'RE NOW REQUIRING THEM TO COME TO PUT THE INFORMATION IN A DETAILED LEVEL THERE BY DRIVING WORK -- EFFORT AT THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS OTHERS THAT BACK LAW. AND SO WE HAVE BEEN PARTNERING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO LOOK AT THAT WORK FLOW AND LOOK AT WAYS THAT WE CAN. MEET THEIR NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HITTING THE RIGHT FUNDS AND THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT. WITHOUT BEING AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THE ADDITIONAL WORK THAT THEY HAVE. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THE THE ISSUES THAT WE HEAR ABOUT FROM THE DEPARTMENTS -- THEN WE ALSO HEAR SOME CONCERNS FROM. FROM VENDORS. SO THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WHEN I'VE I'VE BEEN ON THE PROJECT FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS NOW. I WHEN I FIRST CAME ON WE HAD JUST. RELEASE WE HAD ABOUT THIRTY OR FORTY DEPARTMENTS IN IN THAT THIS IS NEVER THE SMALLER ONES THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WERE BOARD MEMBERS AND HAD -- USUALLY OTHER DEPARTMENTS EITHER HELPING THEM WITH THEIR BOOKS OR NOT. BUT I WAS CALLED IN FRONT OF A LEGISLATURE A COUPLE OF TIMES AS WELL AS IN FRONT OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN -- CABLE. I'VE GOT BOARD MEMBERS THAT ARE GETTING PAID. AND I BRING THIS EXAMPLE UP BECAUSE I THINK THAT THIS IS A SUCCESS OF FISCALE. ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO GET PAID FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT YOU HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TAX INFORMATION. RECORDED WITH THE STATE SO WE KNOW HOW. TO ISSUE YOUR TEN NINETY NINE OR YOUR W. TWO OR WHATEVER YOU THE RIGHT TAX DOCUMENT IS. SO WE CALL THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A STANDARD TWO OH FOUR FORM. WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED FISCALE. THERE WERE A LOT OF VENDORS INCLUDING MEMBERS THAT WERE PART TIME MEMBERS ON BOARD CHECK OUT PER DIEM THEY DIDN'T HAVE THESE THIS INFORMATION ON FILE. SO WHILE IT WAS A PAIN POINT FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS AT THE TIME. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THOSE HAVE ALL. YOU KNOW THOSE ISSUES HAVE ALL GONE AWAY AT THIS POINT THERE'S YOU KNOW IT'S BECOME THE EXPECTATION AND AND IT IS NOW THE NORM. NOW THERE ARE OTHER YOU KNOW STRUGGLES THAT THAT VENDORS DO HAVE -- DEPARTMENTS HAVING GETTING SOME OF THE PAYMENTS OUT. SOMETIMES IT IS WE'RE HITTING THE WRONG ACCOUNTS AND AGAIN THIS IS A LEARNING CURVE WE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOBS. AND SO WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US IN THIS THIS BUDGET TO THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THAT. IS THAT WE'RE BRINGING. RESOURCES TO BEAR. TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO HELP THEM WITH THE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PIECE SO THAT THEY ARE. MORE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES BEFORE THE MISTAKES HAPPEN. WE'RE ALSO UTILIZING RESOURCES. TO ASSIST WITH THE RESOLUTION OF OF MORE LEGACY KENNETH ERRORS OR ISSUES THAT MAY HAVE COME IN AS PART OF THEIR CONVERSIONS. AND WE'RE ALSO UTILIZING THOSE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE. FASTER TICKET RESPONSE TIME IN MY OWN SHOP SO AGAIN IF IF THEY'VE GOT AN ISSUE WHAT WHAT IS MY TURN AROUND TIME TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT. TO GET THE DEPARTMENTS BACK AND MOVING -- SO AS YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF THE ISSUES AND THE STRUGGLES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS ARE HAVING. ARE NOT SO MUCH WITH THE I. T. NOT THAT THE I. T. IS PERFECT AND YOU KNOW THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE WE HAD. TRANSACTION TAKING FORTY FIVE SECONDS TO PROCESS AT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE'VE GOTTEN THAT DOWN TO SIX SECONDS AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE IMPROVE THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM. WE'RE LOOKING AT AGAIN WITH THE RESOURCES PROVIDED PULLING OUT -- THE ANALYTICS PIECE IN THE REPORTING PIECE OUT OF THE THE MAIN SYSTEM THE FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM AND PUTTING ANY WAS SEPARATE INSTANT SO AGAIN THAT'S NOT A LAG. OR WHERE ON THE SYSTEM CAUSING -- DELAYS OR ANY HANG UPS ON ANY OTHER SERVER SO. WELL THERE AREN'T YOU KNOW LOTS OF AYE HE PROBLEMS AT THIS POINT YOU KNOW THE TICKETING DATA SHOWS THAT WHEN I FIRST DEPLOYED. WE HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SYSTEM NUMBER NUMBER SYSTEM ISSUES AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE USER AS THE USER NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP SO HAVE THE HOW TO QUESTIONS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE FOCUSING -- A LOT OF OUR AT OUR OUR EFFORTS TODAY -- SO. AS THE PROJECT NEARS COMPLETION AND AND WE REALLY HAVE FOCUSED IN THE LAST YEAR ON SHIFTING TO THAT. DEPARTMENTAL SUPPORT WE'VE DONE A COUPLE OF KEY THINGS. WE INCREASED -- THE PARTICIPATION AN INSTRUCTOR LED TRAINING. OUT AND WE'VE DONE THAT BOTH ON SITE AT FISCALE WHICH WE CALL USER SUPPORT LABS BUT WE'VE AGAIN BEEN ABLE TO PUT MORE RESOURCES IN THE DEPARTMENTS TO ASSIST WITH THAT. WE'VE HAD -- THE DEPARTMENT STAFF TAKE THIRTY THREE THOUSAND SELF GUIDED COURSES IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT NUMBER IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PAST WE ARE LOOKING AT UPDATING THE CURRICULUM AND KEEPING THAT MODERN AS WELL. AND SO AGAIN THIS IS THE CONTINUAL RE FRESH THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING AS WE DO ENHANCEMENTS -- TO TO THE SYSTEM. WE HAVE DEPLOYED SELF SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN'T SO USERS ARE THEY BEING ABLE TO COME IN INSTEAD OF HAVING TO CALL AND ASK. FOR EITHER A PASSWORD RESET OR TO HAVE SOMEBODY NEW ON THEIR ACCOUNTING STAFF ADDED WITH WITH ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. THEY CAN DO THAT ONLINE -- AND IS EITHER ENTIRELY AUTOMATED OR IT DOES REQUIRE THAT YOU KNOW A HUMAN INTERVENTION IN OUR AND IF CERTAIN FLAGS COME OFF -- WERE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE SEPARATION OF DUTIES THAT WAY THE DEPARTMENTS ARE THEN NOTIFIED SAYING OKAY WELL THIS PERSON CANNOT BE BOTH AN APPROVER. AS WELL AS A REQUEST -- AND THEN THE DEPARTMENTS ARE ULTIMATELY GIVEN THAT AUTHORITY TO SAY YES BUT I ONLY HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN MY COUNTY SHOP THEY HAVE TO AND SO WERE WE ARE AT KNOWLEDGE CHIANG THIS VIOLATION OF THE SEPARATION OF DUTIES AND AS A BACK IT'S RECORDED AS WELL. SO THAT AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT'S ONLY DATED THE DEPARTMENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACCOUNTING IN THEIR BOOKS AND THEIR UTILIZING OUR SYSTEM TO DO IT SO THERE'S DEFINITELY LINES AS TO WHAT I HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO AND WHAT REALLY PROTECT REMAINS WITH. THOSE DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS -- AND WE'RE ALSO REALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN GAUGING THE DEPARTMENTS ON THEIR NEEDS. SO SINCE WE STARTED DEPLOYING THIS IN TWENTY TWELVE WE HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FLOOR CONTROL AGENCIES AND WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO MEET THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES. WE'VE ALWAYS HAD AN EYE TOWARDS THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO BE THESE USERS BUT THAT HAS NEVER BEEN THE FOCUS. SO I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN APRIL WE KICKED OFF -- WHAT WE CALL IMAGINE FISCALE AND THESE ARE DESIGN LED THINKING SESSIONS THEY WERE THREE DAYS WHICH WE INVITED ALL OF THE DEPARTMENTS THEY AT? HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS WERE INVITED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOR THIRTY I THINK THIRTY SIX DEPARTMENTS AND ULTIMATELY AFTER HUNDRED THIRTY PARTICIPANTS Là WITH THIRTY SIX DEPARTMENTS WERE WERE PARTICIPATING. OUT OF THAT WE LOOKED WE HAD A WHOLE DAY DEDICATED TO WHAT ARE YOU WORE. CUSTOMER SERVICE NEEDS HOW CAN THE FISCAL SYSTEM THE FISCAL STAFF SUPPORT YOU BETTER IN UTILIZING THE SYSTEM. THEN WE HAD ANOTHER WHOLE DAY DEDICATED TO TRAINING HOW CAN THE FISCALE. DEPARTMENTS AND PARTNER DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERS BETTER EQUIPPED SHIELD AND THEN FINALLY THE LAST IT WAS ON THE SYSTEM WE HAVE. YOU KNOW FROM THERE WE HAD TWENTY TWO IDEAS SEVEN OF THEM ARE BEING -- DEPLOYED AS WHOLE CONCEPTS IN THE NEXT -- THIRTY SIXTY NINETY DAYS AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER HANDFUL THAT WERE PORTIONS OF THOSE LARGER CONCEPT SO AGAIN THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE EXPECT TO BE DOING -- A COUPLE OF TIMES A YEAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S FEEDING INTO MY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM WE DO SEVERAL HUNDRED ENHANCEMENTS -- EVERY MONTH OR SO AND AND SO IT'S AN EVERY QUARTER SO AND SO WE NEED TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING IN ON THE RIGHT THINGS -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS ASKED AS I WAS BRIEFING WITH SOME OF YOU WAS HOW ARE WE MEASURING OUR SUCCESS. SO WITH THESE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO US. THE THE GOAL IS TO MOVE -- TO GET. YOU KNOW 85% OF THE DEPARTMENTS TO CLOSE ACTUAL -- BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR AND THIS YEAR WE'RE GOING TO BE VERY CLOSE TO THAT AS WELL IS WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING. THE REST IS A IS WILL BE DOT WILL BE CLOSED USING ESTIMATES THAT AGAIN THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY. THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS WELL AS WITH INPUT FROM THE CSA SO IN AGAIN THE SECOND PANEL COULD SPEAK MORE TO ACCOUNTING THAN I CAN BUT SO THESE ARE SO THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER HAPPENING IN THE DEPARTMENTS. THAT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE WILL BE SUFFICIENTLY TRAINING THE DEPARTMENT AT HOME ON THEIR UNIQUE PROCESSES ON THEIR UNIQUE SITUATIONS AND NEEDS. HOW TO BE SUCCESSFUL UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM? WE WILL ALSO HAVE -- A GOAL OF WE HAVE A GOAL TO HAVE ALL OF OUR TICKETS. AND BUT 90% OF OUR TICKETS ARE CLOSED IN FIVE DAYS OR LESS SO. AGAIN THESE ARE ISSUES THAT THAT. ARE HOLDING DEPARTMENTS OP FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK IN THE SYSTEM AND WE NEED TO BE MORE RESPONSIVE. ON THAT WE RIGHT NOW ARE AT 71% OF TICKETS ARE CLOSED IN FIVE DAYS OR LESS. AND ANOTHER -- EIGHTEEN SO IS CLOSED AND JEFF EIGHTEEN BETWEEN SIX AND FOURTEEN DAYS SO THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE YOU KNOW TARGETING THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME OF THOSE TICKETS. THAT ARE REALLY ENHANCEMENTS OF SOME SORT OR OR ARE TRULY A BODY THAT WE NEED TO WORK WITH -- ORACLE OR THE UNDERLYING. PROVIDER ON SOME OF THOSE TWO TO ADDRESS. I'M SO S. P. R. EIGHT IS ALSO AN OUTCOME OF THIS PAST YEAR'S WORK AT THE RECOGNITION THAT. WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEPLOY THE CASH COMPONENTS IN. JULY OF THIS YEAR AND THAT IT WOULD TAKE ANOTHER YEAR. SO WE PUT FORWARD AT THE SAME TIME AS WE HAD OUR REQUEST INTO THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING. WE HAVE A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT NUMBER EIGHT AT C. D. T. -- WE'VE GOT THAT TO THEM I THINK LAST WEEK AND SO THEY HAVE ABOUT TWO WEEKS THAT THEY WILL BE LOOKING AT IT AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK. WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM -- IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF IT AS WELL AS WITH OUR FOR PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT WOULD IN FACT CHANGES FROM AT RED STATUS BACK. TO TO A GREEN OR AT AT THE VERY LEAST A A YELLOW STATUS SO -- SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON THAT IT HAS BEEN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BECAUSE AGAIN THAT THE TESTING IN THE ABILITY TO TO GET THE REMAINING WORK DONE REALLY IS BETWEEN US AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. WE HAVE AGREEMENT ON THIS S. P. R. IN THIS PATH FORWARD TO GET US TO DON BY JULY [inaudible] ONE TWENTY TWENTY NOW. FROM THERE WE WILL YOU KNOW THEY WILL RUNTHAT THE KAFFIR IN PARALLEL FOR ONE TO TWO YEARS BEFORE TURNING OFF THEIR SYSTEM BUT AGAIN THAT THOSE ARE. YEAH THAT'S WHERE MY WORK KIND OF STOPS AND THERE'S STARTS IF YOU WILL -- SO WE GET A JUST IN IN CLOSING. THE THE RESOURCES THAT WERE PROVIDED IN THE SPRING FINANCE LADDER -- WE WILL BE COMPLETING THE SCO FUNCTIONALITY AND EXACT REQUEST THAT WE HAD BEFORE YOU IT INCLUDED SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO DO THAT -- WE PROVIDE ENHANCEMENT SUPPORT FOR ALL OF THAT THE CUSTOMERS WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE THREE YEARS. SO WE GET AND HOW MUCH CHANGE MANAGEMENT HOW MUCH COMEY INSTITUTIONALIZING DOCUMENT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE KNOWLEDGE IS THE KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER NOT ONLY HAPPENING WITHIN FISCALE. IT ALSO HAS TO HAPPEN AT THE DEPARTMENTS RIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE MY GREAT STAFF TO DO. WILL BE IN THIS IS A VICIOUS LOOP -- AND AND THE DOLLARS REALLY DO REFLECT THAT THE SHIFT IN THE FOCUS REALLY IS ABOUT. THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. BECAUSE WE ARE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THAT THE SYSTEM IS IN IN GOOD SHAPE. WE ARE NOT. BUILDING THE LEGACY SYSTEM OF TOMORROW WE'RE BUILDING A PLATFORM FOR THE FUTURE. WE HAVE -- AS I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE DOING CONSTANT ENHANCEMENTS WE HAVE AN ENHANCEMENT PROCESS SO IN ADDITION TO THE POINT THAT LAST BIT OF FUNCTIONALITY. WE'RE CONSTANTLY LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICE AND THE BEST SYSTEM. FOR THE NEEDS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GREAT WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU BEFORE WE HEAR FROM OUR OTHER PANELISTS. I MEAN IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS MAKE SURE THAT. I UNDERSTAND CAN OUR STATUS SO. HE BEGAN THE UPDATE BY SAYING THE SYSTEM IS FULLY DEPLOYED. IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND IN THE AUDITOR'S LETTER OF JANUARY. TWENTY NINETEEN THEY CALLED TO ATTENTION KIND OF THIS FUNDAMENTAL DISCONNECT ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF DEPLOYED AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS SO NOT AS OTHER SAID ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT OFFICE. IMPLEMENTED MEANS SYSTEM IS READY TO USE AND THE ENTITY HAS A STARTING POINT FOR RECORDING TRANSACTIONS. IMPLEMENTED DOES NOT MEAN THAT ENTITIES HAVE TRANSITION FOR LEGACY SYSTEMS TO PASCAL NOR DOES IT MEAN THAT USERS WITH IN THOSE ENTITIES ARE FULLY TRAINED DOT TRANSACTION ARE CONDUCTING THE STATE'S BUSINESS. WITH BEST GAL SO I THINK WHEN I HEAR FULLY DEPLOYED I HEAR PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY USING IT. WHEN YOU SAY FULLY DEPLOYED? WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY MEAN SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME? I ONLY HAVE FIVE DEPARTMENTS UTILIZING A LEGACY SYSTEM OKAY SO FOUR OF THEM. ARE USING THE CAL STAR SYSTEM. TWO OF WHICH ARE DOING IT FOR A FEDERAL REPORT. THAT AGAIN THE ISSUE -- IS RIGHT NOW OUTSIDE OF THE SYSTEMS CONTROL AND IS WITH MY PARTNERS WITH IT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON THE REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST MAKING SHORTEN CLEARING THIS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO AGAIN IT'S NOT PER SE A SYSTEM ISSUE IT'S IT'S THAT POLICY IN MAKING SURE THAT THAT WE'RE GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION SO THAT IT WAS WITH A COUPLE OF THE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN THERE ARE TWO THAT ARE DOING DO WILL TRANSACTING IN THE SYSTEM -- AND WILL LIKELY CLOSE IN THE CAL STARS SYSTEM AND THAT WOULD BE THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND AGAIN WITH THE NATURE OF WHAT THEY DO YOU -- IT WAS DEEMED AGAIN BY THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING THE PROJECT IT WAS IT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET FOR THEM -- AND THEN THAT SECOND DEPARTMENT IS [inaudible] DDS [inaudible] DSS THANK. I KNEW WHAT I HEAR WHISPERS FROM BEHIND ME -- THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS IS THAT THE SECOND DEPARTMENT THAT WILL BE CLOSING UTILIZING A LEGACY SYSTEM. NOW THE OTHER DEPARTMENT THAT IS UTILIZING A LEGACY SYSTEM THAT WE THAT WE ARE AWARE OF IS -- THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT EDT AND THEY DO NOT USE CAL STARS SO IT'S UNCLEAR TO US HOW MUCH -- OF THE WORK WE DO HAVE VISIBILITY INTO THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM SO I CAN'T REALLY DO A FAIR COMPARISON TO KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE WORK IS HAPPENING IN FISCAL VERSES. IN THEIR LEGACY BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY TOO WILL BE CLOSING THEIR BOOKS THIS YEAR IN THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM. SO WE SAID THAT WAS DEPLOYED TO ALL THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAD DONE THEIR CONVERSIONS. AND WE HAVE HAD THEM READY IN A POSITION WHERE WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEPS WITH A NEEDED -- TO VALIDATE THE INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN CONVERTED. DO ANY ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATIONS THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE ON THE POST GO LOCAL GO LIVE SIDE BECAUSE EACH OTHER DEPARTMENTS CAN DO THEIR OWN CONFIGURATIONS FOR LABOR AND ALLOCATIONS AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS. AND IT ABSOLUTELY THERE WAS A NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THE CUTOVER THAT WERE UTILIZING BOTH FISCALE AND AND CAL STARS. BUT THAT WAS TRUE WITH ALL OF THE RELEASES IT IS THAT THAT. COMFORT WITH WHAT YOU NOW IN IN YOUR ABILITY TO TO PULL REPORTS OUT IS YOU KNOW IN A TIMELY FASHION. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENTS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND YOU KNOW OTHERS THAT ARE CREATING REPORTS IN THE SYSTEM FOR THE DEPARTMENT THEY WERE TAKING THEM FROM THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT DID CAL STARS AND YOU KNOW I WANTED TO RUN REPORT. WELL FOR WHATEVER IT IS THAT IT MEANS SOMETHING IN PLAIN LANGUAGE. I TO THEM IN THE IN IN THE FISCAL SYSTEMS THAT CROSSWALK HAS BEEN DON IN IS AVAILABLE ON SOME KEY REPORTS FOR FOR MOUNTAINEERING CLOSE. AND THAT IS AVAILABLE ON THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES WEBSITE AS WELL AS LINKS FROM MY SIDE SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES AND ONE OF THE HURDLES. BETTER KEEPING DEPARTMENTS FROM BEING AS FLOWING TO THE SYSTEM. BUT VERY FEW DEPARTMENTS STILL HAVE ACCESS BESIDES VIEWING ACCESS TO THEIR CAL STARS DATA. OKAY SO IN IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT THERE WERE FOURTEEN DEPARTMENTS. USING CAL STARS OR THEIR LEGACY SYSTEM YOU'RE SAYING NOW IT IS FOUR AND CAL STARS [inaudible] FIVE FTV DSS -- DUAL AND EDT ON SOME OTHER LEGACY SYSTEM SO IT'S NOW SEVEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ON GET THAT IS A FIVE IS CAL STARS ANOTHER. LEGACY THINGS ARE A LOT OKAY IT'S FIVE FIVE OH FIVE ON CAL STARS. THERE AND NO ONE ON AND ONE ON THIS LEGACY SO. SIX SIX SIX IN TOTAL OKAY AND ARE THERE ANY OF THESE APARTMENTS STILL REPORTING CONCERNS WITH USING FISCALE TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS A COUPLE THAT. THAT THE ISSUE THAT WAS OUTSTANDING AS TO WHY THEY WERE UTILIZING CAL STARS WAS FOR A SPECIFIC REPORT. THAT REPORT HAS BEEN AS FAR AS I KNOW HAS BEEN WORKED OUT WITH THE SCO AND THAT THE CONTROLLER AND AND THE FEDS. BUT THEY HAVE NOT -- I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'VE SUBMITTED IT YET SO AGAIN I WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE NEXT PARENTS CIVIL ASSET NEXT TIME SO AND THEN AND THERE PERHAPS. THIS IS THE QUESTION THE NEXT HOUSE ALBEIT AT WHAT IS THE STATUS OF MONTH AND CLOSE PRO ENTITY SO HOW MANY OF THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE. USING THE SYSTEM ARE ACTUALLY USING IT. TO PRODUCE TIMELY AND ACCURATE SO NUMBERS IN MARCH I HAD. FORTY ABOUT 42% OF DEPARTMENTS. ARE 40% AMOUNTS WERE CLOSED. THAT NEEDED TO BE CLOSED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. TODAY SENT 42% OKAY DAY I'M UP ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE. TO MOVE IN SHIFT FROM OTHER ACTIVITIES AND THEN WITH THE AUGMENTATION THAT IS COMING IN JULY ONE WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO TO REALLY HAVE AXLES. FOR YOU KNOW CLOSE 290% OF TOTAL BUDGETARY EXPENDITURE SO THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT THE CLIP THAT REPRESENT ABOUT 90% OF THE BUDGET -- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO CLOSE WITH ACTUAL AND THAT'S WHEN SORRY. THAT'S BY WHEN THAT WILL BE BY THE THE THE DATES THAT WERE SET FORTH BY -- THAT BUT BY THE CONTROLLER SO THERE'S SOME FUN TO DO JULY -- ONE IN PSALM ARE DUE AUGUST ONE OR AUGUST. THIRTY ONE AUGUST OKAY. AND BUT THEN I KNOW THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE. HAD REALLY UNTIL ABOUT OCTOBER FIRST OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND THAT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE START WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO DO ESTIMATES SO. THAT BY THAT TIME FRAME IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT SO TRY TO GET AS MANY AS WE CAN BY THE THE REQUIRED DEADLINES AND THEN ALSO. TARGETING THOSE BIG DEPARTMENTS ARE THOSE THOSE BIG DOLLAR VALUE DEPARTMENTS -- THE ONES ARE MOST MATERIAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THOSE. ARE RECEIVING THE BULK OF OUR ATTENTION. SO WHAT THAT MEANS THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT WE'VE ANALYZED AND BASED ON EITHER HISTORY -- SIZE OR COMPLEXITY OR VACANCY RATES ARE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT THERE WILL BE ABOUT -- THIRTY DEPARTMENTS THAT WE EXPECT WILL BE DOING. ESTIMATES THAT WE'RE WE'RE FAIRLY CONFIDENT WE'LL BE DOING ESTIMATES. AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING WHEN YOU SEE THAT THEY REPRESENT. YOU KNOW WHAT. LESS THAN A FEW PERCENT OF THE TOTAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE STATE THEY'RE NOT FEDERALLY FUNDED DEPARTMENTS SO WILD THE GOAL IS YOU KNOW NEXT YEAR TO BE ABLE TO TO HAVE THEM ALL. YEAH WITH A VERY THICK THERE'S ALWAYS SOME THAT THEY DON'T. BUT WHAT WE WANT TO BE PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE ABLE. TO SOMETIMES DEPARTMENTS DON'T CLOSE FOR THINGS OUTSIDE OF FISCAL. AND AGAIN FISCAL HAS BROUGHT THESE THINGS TO LIGHT SO THERE ARE CERTAIN -- THINGS THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE -- ACCOUNTING PRACTICES THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN DOING THEM SLIGHTLY DIFFERENTLY OR NOT EXACTLY RIGHT AS OF NOW THEY'RE HAVING TO GO BACK INTO A LOT OF RECONCILIATION WORK. AGAIN BY THE SECOND OR THIRD YEAR UTILIZING THE SYSTEM. THERE IS THIS LEARNING CURVE AND THE DEPARTMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY. BETTER POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR THEIR WORK DONE IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION. SO -- OKAY GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE REALLY FUN MR FUNG. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE FOR SO FOR MOST -- I GUESS AT CAN I WE TALKED THE A YESTERDAY AND YOU INDICATED THEIR NUMBER AGENCIES THAT THAT CURRENTLY ARE EXAM THIRD ARE NOT USING UTILIZING FISCAL NOW. WHAT ARE THOSE AGENCIES I THINK YOU YOU TRY LIST THEM OFF FOR BUT I THINK YOU MISSED A COUPLE SO I SAW THE RECORDS I DIDN'T WRITE THEM DOWN LET'S SEE I CAN DO THEM TODAY IF NOT? FOR I'VE GOT FOLKS BEHIND ME THEY CAN'T SO THE EXEMPT WINDS WOULD BE THE LEGISLATURE HERS STIRRERS AND THE UC SYSTEM THOSE ONES ARE NEVER EXPECTED TO COME ON TO OUR SYSTEM. THE ONES THAT ARE DEFERRED INCLUDE CALTRANS DMV THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. I CDC ARE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I'M AT FIVE CDT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY [inaudible] OKAY. REHAB THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION. IS THAT ALL OF THEM. I GET A WE GET A YES THEY'RE NOT AND SO SEVEN AND THEN IN TERMS OF AND NOT AS THEIR DEFERRED. DENTAL WHAT IS THE TIME LINE FOR THEM TO COME ON BOARD. WE'RE EXPECTING CD T. TO COME ON IN JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY THERE ARE SMALLER DEPARTMENT AND WERE ABLE TO ON BOARD THAT -- JUST THROUGH THROUGH OUR REGULAR PROCESS IN A REGULAR RESOURCES WE ARE LOOKING AT DOING A GAP ANALYSIS THIS YEAR WITH THE OTHER LARGER DEPARTMENTS. SO. MY EARLY INDICATIONS FROM THEM IS THAT LIKELY CALTRANS WILL BE ONE OF THE NEXT ONES TO CALM BECAUSE THEY'RE NEARING THE END OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF THEIR ERP SYSTEM THEIR EXISTING SYSTEM. SO WE WILL BE DOING -- A COORDINATED EFFORT WITH THEM TO SEE WHAT WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF ACCOUNTING NEEDS THAT YOU HAVE OR OTHER PROJECT MANAGEMENT NEEDS. AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN FISCAL WHAT MIGHT BE THAT GAP -- TO KNOW WHAT ADJUSTMENTS OR WHAT MODELS I MIGHT NEED TO BRING ON OR WHAT CHANGES THAT THEY MAY NEED TO MAKE. SO. MY EXPECTATION IS THAT WITH SOME OF THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING CALTRANS INCLUDING CDC ARE. THAT WITH THEIR I. WHEN THEY DO COME ON WE WILL BE COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ASKING FOR FOR RESOURCES FOR THAT ON BOARDING EFFORT JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE SO INCREDIBLY LARGE. AND WE ARE -- WE ARE WINDING DOWN THE SIZE OF MY CONTRACTING STAFF AND AND SO SOME OF THAT WORK THAT WE WOULD NEED TO BRING BACK CONTRACTORS FOR ONE TIME EFFORTS WE WOULD WANT TO DO THAT AGAIN SO -- WITH THE WITH THE SIZE OF THESE AGENCIES I MEAN THAT THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL WORK THEN LEFT TO DO. YES WE HAVE 65% OF TOTAL BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEMS OF SOME OF THE BIG DEPARTMENTS ARE STILL OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM. WHEN THE STATE CONTROLLER'S -- OFFICE COMES FULLY ONLINE WITH THE CASH RECORDS WE WILL HAVE SOME HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION ON THE SAME LEVEL OF THE CONTROLLER HAS TODAY WE'LL HAVE THAT HIGH LEVEL IN OUR SYSTEM -- THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE VIA OUR OUR TRANSPARENCY SITE BUT BUT NOT. THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT WE HAVE ON THOSE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM SO. IT WILL AT YOUR YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT IT'LL BE A FEW YEARS BEFORE WE HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL. SO THEN IN TERMS OF I GUESS MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME THAT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S A STEERING COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES THE THIS PROJECT. HOW DOES IT INTERACTION AND WHO'S THE ULTIMATE -- WHO'S ACCOUNTABLE AND IN TERMS OF THE OF OVERSIGHT OF FISCAL AND AND HOW THE STEERING COMMITTEE COMMITTEE OPERATES. NO TAKE THAT I WITH RESPECT YOUR QUESTION SIR I AM RESPONSIBLE ON THE PROJECT SPONSOR AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND SO. TO TO YOUR POINT THAT WOULD BE ME OKAY SO THEN SAID IN THE STEERING COMMITTEE MEETS AND THEN THEY REPORT TO YOU THAT WORKS NOT NOW BUT YOU HAVE TO THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBLE THAT THE STEERING COMMITTEE IN OUR CHARTER WE WE MAKE -- DECISIONS AS A GROUP THAT BY CONSENSUS OKAY SO -- THAT OPERATE SORT OF LIKE THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL NOT REGARD. I'M NOT SURE THAT IS THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU WANT TO USE -- YOU MAY WANT TO REVISE YOUR CHANCE -- OKAY SO IN IN TERMS OF FROM FROM THAT SAMPLE AND THEN AND THEN WHAT IS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN -- AND AS YOU TEACH HERE THE CVT AND AND THIS CALENDAR DEPART FINANCE. SO THE THE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OVERSIGHT ENTITIES THAT THE PROVIDE OUTSIDE. OVERVIEW SO THE DEPARTMENT OF I A TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES INDEPENDENT PROJECT OVERSIGHT I PET WHICH WHICH FRANCISCO CAN SPEAK TALE -- AND AGAIN THEY'RE THEY'RE OVER SEEING KIND OF OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND HOW WE ARE STAYING -- IN LINE WITH SCOPE SCHEDULE TYPES OF THINGS BUT I ALSO HAVE INDEPENDENT VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION WHICH IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTS THAT -- IS RUNNING TO HELP US WITH THE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL PIECES ARE WE MAKING DECISIONS THAT ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY SOUND IS THE SYSTEM GOING TO TO FUNCTION -- AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S THE CSA ALSO DO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF OVERSIGHT OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WHERE -- WHERE I SPENT QUITE A TIME THIS THIS YEAR? AND THEN -- SO THAT THAT -- TODAY IN TERMS OF THIS AND THIS IS PROBABLY NOT MAYBE IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE HEARING ABOUT. THIS NEW -- DID YOU INNOVATION AGENTS OR OFFICE HAS BEEN CREATED HOW DOES THAT HOW DOES THAT FIT IN TEND TO YOUR THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND THE OVERSIGHT AND AND WHAT IS THEIR ROLE -- IN FISCAL IF AT ALL. SO AGAIN RIDICULE AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ODI AS PROPOSED AND FOR FIRST OF ALL THE THE PROJECT WILL BE DONE. TO SORT OF ABOUT THE SAME TIME ODIS GETTING OFF THE GROUND IT DOESN'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JULY ONE AND THEY HAVE TO SORT OF BUILD THE ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S GONNA BE STARTED OUT TELLING ABOUT THE TIME FISCALES WANTING DOWN. AYE AYE BUT I JUST FOR CONTACT SOMEONE -- PROVIDE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON WHERE WE ARE TODAY I THIS GIRL IS THE TECHNOLOGY IS BUILT AND IT'S DEPLOYED THE PROJECT IS DEPLOYED -- WE DON'T HAVE TECHNOLOGY CHALLENGES PER SE WITH THIS GUY WHAT WE HAVE THIS IS A MASSIVE HUMAN CHANGE MANAGEMENT EFFORT AT THIS POINT -- AND AND WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT NOT EXPERIENCE WE WE PROBABLY SHOULD COME OUT OF THE GATE A LITTLE STRONGER ON CHANGE MANAGEMENT -- BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT ALONG THE WAY WE'VE LISTENED OUR DEPARTMENTS WE LISTEN TO OUR OVERSIGHT ENTITIES -- AND OUR CUSTOMERS -- I WAS ONE UNTIL I CAME BACK TO FINANCE SIX EIGHT MONTHS AGO I WAS IT DIRECTOR COLLEGE ART I WAS A CUSTOMER IF THE SCOUTS I I KNOW I KNOW THE PAIN POINT FROM BOTH SIDES -- AND SO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT AND AND OUR OUR SPRING LETTER THIS YEAR THAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT DOUBLING DOWN ON CHANGE MANAGEMENT THAT'S ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE AND IT'S ABOUT. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER FROM OUR CONTRACTED RESOURCES TO OUR STATE WORKFORCE AND SO THAT THAT'S WHERE OUR EFFORTS REALLY ARE TODAY -- IS BUSINESS INTERNET -- POINTED OUT THAT THERE IS THIS IS THIS IS A COMPLEX PROJECT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FOR US TO SCALE. WE HAVE A WORKFORCE OF A QUARTER MILLION WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS APARTMENTS BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS WE HAVE TWENTY THOUSAND SYSTEM USERS. THIS IS A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING SO. SO BUT AT THIS POINT WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT ONE CHANGE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE ARE OKAY SO THEN BUT AS THEY DOVE TELL ME YOUR YOU'RE ADDING ON THE THE DEFERRED -- AGENCIES RIGHT SO CALTRANS EMITTED THE ONES YOU LOVE TO CATCH AND YET DMV DDR CDC ARE DOJ CD T. AND REHABILITATION -- SO THEN. DO YOU FORESEE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES ARE IS A MAIN I GUESS. THIS GUY OUT IS NOT TECHNICALLY WINDING DOWN IF YOU'RE ME THE ONE DOWN IN TERMS OF THE YOUR INITIAL SCOPE BUT YOU STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK LEFT TO DO. AND AND WE CONTINUE TURN OVER TIME WE WE WE ARE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS CONSUL IN THE PROJECT SO IS IS WE FOUND PAIN POINTS FOR DEPARTMENTS WHETHER WE CAN CREATE A NEW REPORT AUTOMATE SOMETHING RECONCILE SOMETHING AN AUTOMATED FASHION WE'RE DOING THAT. ALL THE TIME AND WE LOOK OF RELEASING THOSE. INTO PRODUCTION IN REAL TIME AND SO SO WHAT WERE WHAT CHECKING SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF THAT WAY BUT WE'RE ALSO MAKING SURE THE STAFF HAVE THE SKILL SETS TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO -- SO SO THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING COMPRESS SO THAT IN ITSELF FROM THE OTI PERSPECTIVE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY THEY AND WE EXPECT THEM TO BRING NOVEL IDEAS AND APPROACHES THE DIGITAL SERVICE DELIVERY THAT. THAT WE CAN TAKE THOSE AND WE CAN INCORPORATE THAT INTO FISCAL AS WE DO THESE ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS ABSOLUTELY BUT BUT SORT OF AS A AN IMMEDIATE THING I DON'T TOUCH SO BUT YOU DON'T YOU DON'T FOR SEE THEM BEING PART OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE I GUESS I AS A QUESTION. IS -- I GUESS IN TERMS OF LIKE. THE THE THE OVERSIGHT DO YOU SEE THEM AS KIND OF ANOTHER STAKEHOLDER OR ARE THEY JUST AN ADVISORY ROLE AS WELL I MEAN I'VE DOES JUST. THAT WOULD BE AN ADVISOR ROLE IN THE AND WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ADDING THEM TO THE GOVERNMENT'S MODEL AT THIS POINT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR JUST READ CYNICAL QUESTION BECAUSE YOU TOUCHED UPON THIS A LITTLE BIT EARLIER -- WE MENTION SPRING LETTER BUT ALSO THE BUDGET ALLOCATION ANYTHING TO ACTUALLY -- FOR TRAINING FOR FOLKS PEOPLE MOVING AWAY FROM THE LEGACY SYSTEM ACTUALLY ON TO FACE CAL COMPLETELY. AND WHAT WAS THE ANTICIPATED -- TIMELINE FOR THAT WERE WE WERE NO LONGER BE USING THE LEGACY SYSTEMS AND COMPLETELY ON FISCAL ALSO WE'RE NOT. DOUBLING UP. TO THE SENATE. THE DEPARTMENTS -- MIGHT HAVE OTHER LEGACY SYSTEMS THEY DO THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. I CAME FROM A DEPARTMENT THAT THAT HAD ONE OF THOSE PRIOR TO I TOO WAS A A USER OF THE FISCAL SYSTEM. PRIOR TO COMING TO SCALE -- SO THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE OUTSIDE JUST THE INITIAL SCOPE AND AND WE WOULD HAVE TO TO THINK ABOUT ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO ADD ON BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE FOUR PARTNERS AND THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEIR LEGACY MAINFRAMES -- THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES RETIRED FOUR OF THAT CAN THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS READY TO RETIRE FOUR OF THEM BUT HASN'T YET BECAUSE THERE'S ONE PIECE THAT IS -- TIED TO THE CONTROLLERS FUNCTIONALITY THAT WILL BE COMING BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN ONCE THE CONTROLLER FUNCTIONALITY COMES ON WE HAVE THIS THE EXPECTATION IS THAT WE'RE GONNA RUN. IN IN PARALLEL -- FOR AT LEAST YOU KNOW FOR AT LEAST A YEAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE THE KAFFIR WITH A HIGH CONFIDENCE RIGHT OUT OF OUR SYSTEM AND AND BE ABLE TO COMPARISON TO COMPARE THAT WITH. THE CAFFERTY INCREASED OUT OF THE LEGACY SYSTEM SO AGAIN THAT ULTIMATE WHEN DO YOU DEPARTMENTS OF THE CONTROL AGENCIES TURN OFF THEIR LEGACY SYSTEMS. THAT THAT'S MORE IN IN IN THEIR COURT IT'S ONCE THEY FEEL THAT WE HAVE BUILT ALL THE FUNCTIONALITY AND CAPACITY WITHIN HOURS -- AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE 98% OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE KNOWN REQUIREMENTS THAT. TODAY THAT I KNOW ABOUT -- THOSE ARE HAVE BEEN ALREADY DEPLOYED AND WITH RESPECT TO THE ANOTHER LEGACY SYSTEM THAT WE EXPECT TO BE RETIRED. IS THE CAL STARS SYSTEM AND WE'RE EXPECTING THAT ALSO TO BE WINDING DOWN -- IN TWENTY NINETEEN AS WELL AND AGAIN THERE'S ONLY A FEW DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE UTILIZING IT. REMAINING AND IT BECOMES AS YOU WERE YOU WERE ALLUDING TO IT BECOMES JUST AT THE WORKLOAD. FOR THE CONTROL AGENCIES OF THE DEPARTMENTS THEMSELVES TO IT TO BE HAVING A FOOT IN EACH DOOR. ARE IN EACH SYSTEM -- IT'S IT'S VERY BURDENSOME AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN GET THOSE APARTMENTS OFF OF CAL STARS WILL BE NOT ONLY RELIEF TO TO THE DEPARTMENTS BUT ALSO I WOULD. PRESUME A RELIEF TO THE FOLKS AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE THAT HAVE TO SUPPORT THAT SYSTEM. AND SO YOU MENTIONED THE RUN AROUND A PERIL SYSTEM IS THAT WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE YES. OKAY SO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WILL BE THE LAST. OF THE INITIAL BATCH THE LAST WANTS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE LEGACY SYSTEM. AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT STILL ANOTHER YEAR OUT [inaudible] GEORGE BUSH [inaudible] POSSIBLY. MOST LIKELY. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY NO MORE LEGACY SYSTEM. I'M GEORGE LEWIS ON THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND ASSUMING WE DON'T HAVE ANY HICCUPS AND NO ISSUES AND WERE SATISFIED IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S SATISFIED. YES. THANK YOU KNOW I'M JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET. SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE ON SO JUST IN TERMS CHANGE MANAGEMENT SO SO ARE YOU. ON MEETING THAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW THE TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN DEPLOYED. BUT YOU HAVE. TO TRAIN PEOPLE HOW TO USE IT ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE IT YOUR YOUR FACING SOME RESISTANCE IN TERMS OF CHANGING WHICH I WOULD ANTICIPATE PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY COMFORTABLE WITH A SYSTEM AND IT'S YOU KNOW LIKE IF YOU ASKED US ALL. TO GET OFF OF MICROSOFT WORD AND GO USE SOMETHING ELSE TOMORROW YEAH YOU WOULD YOU WOULD FACE RESISTANCE I JUST. IS REALITY EVEN OTHER COMPARABLE SYSTEMS EXACT SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR ABSOLUTELY SIR AND AND AND YOU KNOW HUMANS HUMANS DON'T REACT THE CHAINS. THAT WELL SOME DO BETTER THAN OTHERS -- GOVERNMENT'S NOT VERY GOOD AT CHANGE MANAGEMENT BECAUSE WE DON'T TEND TO THINK OF THE HUMAN ASPECT OF OUR ACTIONS WE JUST WE'RE GOVERNMENT WE DO THINGS THE WAY WE DO THINGS AND EVERYBODY SORT HAS TO CONFORM TO THAT. AND THEN THAT'S COUPLED WITH AN ENVIRONMENT. LARGE IN OUR ACCOUNTING STAFF THAT THEY THEY'VE OPERATED IN AND IN A SYSTEM AND OUT WORLD FOR DECADES AND AND THEN WE WOULD DROP THIS MASSIVE NEW SYSTEM ON THEM THAT. HAS A LOT OF COMPLEXITY LOT MORE DETAIL WHICH BRINGS WITH IT TRANSPARENCY TRANSPARENCY COMES AT A COST -- SO SO THERE'S WORKLOAD THERE THERE'S NEW WAYS OF DOING BUSINESS -- AND THEN WE'RE FINDING OUT AS WE ROLLING THIS OUT THAT THERE'S CERTAIN THINGS THAT THESE DEPARTMENTS NEED THAT. WITH THE NEXT THING ALSO WERE BUILDING SOME OF THAT FOR THEM TO MAKE THEIR LIFE IS A SO IT'S SO IT'S ALL THAT'S WHAT'S THE EARLY OUT REACH ITS ENGAGEMENTS GETTING THEIR INPUT INTO THE SYSTEM DESIGN AND HOW IT WORKS. IT'S BRING AMENDED TRYING THEM ON SITE TEST GIVE US FEEDBACK ITERATE AND AND SUPPORT AMONG ROLLED OUT LIVE IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS -- SUITS WHICH DEPARTMENT WOULD YOU SAY ARE THE FURTHEST ALONG THAT CURVE CHANGE MANAGEMENT -- WE HAVE A NUMBER THAT -- ARE CLOSING ON A ON A REGULAR AND CONSISTANT BASIS SO -- YEAH THE PARTNERS ARE VERY FAR ALONG ON THAT BUT I'D SAY THAT THAT CALIFORNIA'S FAR AND THEY WERE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RELEASE DEPARTMENT -- AND THEN I HAVE SOME THAT WERE IN MY WAVE ONE THAT ARE LAGGING BEHIND THE CURVE ON IT. AND IN THEIR INSTANCES THEY'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT -- TURN OF RATIONS IT'S NOT. IT'S BECAUSE OUR SMALL DEPARTMENT YOU LOSE ONE PERSON% YOU'VE LOST YOU KNOW 20% OF YOUR ACCOUNTING STAFF OR OR MORE IN SOME CASES. AND SO THAT LEARNING CURVE IS YOU KNOW A DIFFERENT CHALLENGE FOR FOR SOME OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS BUT WE DO HAVE QUITE A FEW I MEAN F. T. B. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GONNA BE CLOSING IN LEGACY. THEY HAVE BEEN EXCELLING IN THIS THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS BEEN -- K. PUSHING. PUSHING AHEAD AND SOME OF THOSE WERE I MENTION BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE SURPRISING TO ME THEY WERE THE ONES THAT I HAD ON MY RADAR AS ALL MY GOSH I I THESE ARE THINGS THAT THAT ABSOLUTELY CANNOT FAIL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE DEPARTMENTS. ARE SUCCESSFUL CHP IS ANOTHER ONE IT WAS A TWENTY EIGHTEEN DEPARTMENT THAT -- WE'RE NOT EVEN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMEONE TOP OF THAT THEY HAVEN'T HAD -- ANY ISSUE SO SO THERE'S DEFINITELY DEPARTMENTS THAT IN AGAIN. DESPITE WHAT I THINK SOME OF THE ORIGINAL THINKING WAS WE'RE GONNA BRING ON THE SMALL DEPARTMENTS AND AND WE LEARNED FROM CONTROL AGENCY ANNA AND THE PROJECT. BUT HAD WE BROUGHT IN THE LARGER DEPARTMENTS FIRST I THINK THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER HOLE FOR THE SMALLER ONES BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE. BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SOPHISTICATION IN THESE LARGER DEPARTMENTS AND THERE'S MORE TO ACCOUNTING THAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN MORE COMPLEXITY SO THE ISSUES THAT THAT WE'RE IDENTIFYING WE WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED. EARLIER IN THE CURRENT AND IN REGARDS TO CAL FIRE WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU THINK MADE THEN. ADOPT OR WHAT WHAT WHAT MADE THEM SUCCESSFUL. BOTH CAL FIRE IN C. H. P. HAD A DESIGNATED. SENIOR PERSON WHO OWNS THIS GUY IT WAS THEIR JOB TO BRING THEIR DEPARTMENT -- ON TO FISCAL. AND THEY WERE GIVEN THE AUTHORITY. AND THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO WITH THE WITH CAL FIRE THEY HAVE -- INVESTED BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF THOSE DISPERSED DEPARTMENTS SAID THEY'VE GOT OFFICES IN AN ACCOUNTING HAPPENING ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE HARDER THEY HAVE HAD THIS INDIVIDUAL HAS TRAVELED UP AND DOWN THE STATE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING CHANGE MANAGEMENT. FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS -- AND SO IT WASN'T JUST WHEN WE STARTED ENGAGING IT'S THAT HAVE LIKE THAT SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT. AND THEY AREN'T. THE THE SPONSOR THE VANDALS BUT BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE DECISION MAKERS THOSE DEPARTMENTS STRUGGLE MICHAEL. BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A SINGLE BOTTLENECK IN THAT CASE SO WE'VE TAKEN THE SPONSOR TO AN EXTRA IN WHERE THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS AND THOSE DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE. IT ENDED IN TERMS OF AND SO AS YOU DEAL WITH THESE DEPARTMENTS AND THERE BY AND ARE YOU. ARE YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT THE YOUR THAT THAT PROJECT LEADER. IN EACH DEPARTMENT IS SWITCHING UP THOSE PEOPLE OR WHAT WHAT HOW ARE YOU APPROACHING AT THAT AGAIN THAT'S THAT DEPENDENT APARTMENTS GET TO MAKE THEIR ASSIGNMENTS AS TO WHO WORKS ON THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS. BUT AS PART OF OUR CHANGE MANAGEMENT AS PART OF US GOING OUT INTO THE DEPARTMENTS -- WERE DOING THINGS LIKE HELPING THEM -- IDENTIFY THEIR WE HAVE SUPER USER FORM SO FOLKS THAT KNOW MULTIPLE MODULES WITHIN EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] DOING -- YOU KNOW A POSTERS WITH THEIR PICTURES ON IT BECAUSE I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW MANY DEPARTMENTS WE'VE GONE INTO I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO MY SUPER USER IT. THESE ARE YOUR FIRST YOU'RE KIND OF POINT ZERO THESE ARE THE FOLKS THAT WE HAVE INVESTED THE EXTRA TRAINING IN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE ARE ARE LEVERAGING AND UTILIZING THIS. SO WE'RE WORKING ON A CAMPAIGN WITH WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE. TO GIVE MORE VISIBILITY INTO THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE SKILL SET AND THEN ALSO -- PROVIDE THOSE SUPER USERS -- MORGAN EXPRESS LINE IF YOU WILL IN TO MY HELP DESK AND INTO MY BUSINESS SERVICES TEAM SO THAT. AGAIN WERE REINFORCING THAT WE NEED MORE PEOPLE IN THE DEPARTMENTS BETTER TAKING OWNERSHIP IN AND AND COMING UP WITH A SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH THEM TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT THE RIGHT LEVEL OF COMMITMENT IN THOSE DEPARTMENTS. AND THEN FIRST WAS TWO PARTS PARTICULAR SO CDC ARE AND SAY CALTRANS I KNOW CDC ARE HAS A HAS A NEWER SYSTEM. SO IT'S NOT TOTALLY INTEGRATED IT'S JUST TO INTERFACE A HOUSE HOW DOES THAT WORK WITH. SISTEMA DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE -- DEPLOYED BUT THEY THEY AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE JUST THE SYSTEM TO JUST SORT OF TALKING TO EACH OTHER. WITH THE RIGHT NOW OUR INTERFACING INTO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON THE ACCOUNTING. AND IT'S AT THE HIGH LEVEL THAT THOSE INTERFACES EXIST WHEN A CONTROLLER COMES ON THOSE INTERFACES WILL BE POINTED YEAH MOVED FROM THEIR LEGACY INTO MY SYSTEM. BUT IT'LL STILL BE THAT HIGH LEVEL OF CAPTURE. IT'S NOT UNTIL WE USE A HIGH LEVEL MEETING TO SINCE YOU DON'T YOU DON'T SEE F. T. E. ZERO C. POSITIONS JUST. JUST BROAD BRUSH EXPENDITURES I'M IN THE PAST THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL YOU GUYS CAPTURE I DON'T. I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE AT THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL UNTIL THEY'RE ACTUALLY ON FISCAL. GOING TO BE MORE OF A SUMMARY LEVEL. SOME OF THE LIKE WE SPENT THIS MUCH MONEY AND WE GOT THIS MONEY LIKE WHEN YOU SEE SOME ELECT FIVE LINE ITEM TO DOCUMENT ON I'LL BE MORE NAP BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE KIND OF DETAIL WHERE YOU CAN BE ABLE TO SEE HOW MUCH THEY SPENT. ON ON FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FOR EXAMPLE HERE SAYS. A MUCH BROADER ARM OF LEVEL LIKE MAYBE FOOD RIGHT. WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING PC HIS ON AFTER ANNOUNCEMENT BUT JUST HAVE SO IT'S LIKE SO CAN WE SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT? BC PEAS AND WORK WHERE THEY'RE GOING. ON THE BUDGET SIDE -- I JUST SIX I DIDN'T. LIKE THAT LIKE SO FOR US WE GET A LOT OF BUDGETARY PROPOSALS. THAT THOSE ARE ALL SORT OF TIED TO PRIMARILY HEAD COUNT. AND SO DO WE DO WE SEE. WOULD WE SEE BE ABLE TO SEE THAT IN FRISCO IN THE BUDGET. AND THE BUDGET SIDE ABSOLUTELY ON THE BUDGET SIDE BUT NOT AS ON THE DEPARTMENT HE SOMEONE ON A COUNTY. RIGHT WOULDN'T COME TO US ON THE ACCOUNT GOT. SO FISCAL HAS BOTH -- FISCAL HAS BOTH THE HYPERION PLATFORM IN SYSTEM THAT WE DO THE BUDGET ON AND THAT THE PEOPLE SOFT AS TO WHAT WE DO THE ACCOUNTING SIDE. GOT IT -- AND SO THEN FOR THE ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE THAN WITH THEIR IT IS A GOAL TO HAVE A MORE. SAY DETAILED BREAKDOWN OF CDC ARE OR CALTRANS VEGAS WHERE WHERE IS THIS GOING. YES I MEAN THE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN THE SYSTEM IN THIS IS AGAIN A GOOD CONVERSATION I THINK FOR THE SECOND PANEL -- BUT THE THE LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT THE APARTMENTS CAN RECORD INFORMATION IN IN OUR SYSTEM CAN BE IT IS QUITE. A FINE LEVEL NOW IS THAT. THE LEVEL WE WANT. TO REQUIRE DEPARTMENTS TO TO PROVIDE INFORMATION GIVEN THE THE FLIP SIDE WHICH IS THE WORKLOAD AND WHAT IS THE VALUE OF KNOWING THAT IT'S A GALA APPLE VERSES OF FUJI APPLE. OR GRANNY SMITH APPLE YOU KNOW. SO SO THERE HAS TO BE KIND OF THAT BALANCE OF AT WHAT LEVEL OF DETAIL DO YOU WANT THAT BUT THE SYSTEM HAS THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE AT A VERY FINE. OKAY IF I CAN JUST ADD ON THAT SIR -- IT WAS THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN THE EARLY PLANNING OF THIS PROJECT TWELVE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO AND AND THAT THAT TIME. THE ADMINISTRATION BACK THEN AND WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE WE HAD A FEW BIG DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT NEEDED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS WITH THE RP SYSTEMS AND BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING FROM STATEWIDE PERSPECTIVE BUT IT THE DECISION THAT MADE AT THE TIME THAT. YOU KNOW CALTRANS IS SO BIG CITIES ARE SO BIG THEY HAVE THEIR OWN ECONOMIES OF SCALE THAT IT WAS WORTH IT TO INVEST IN THOSE SYSTEMS AT THAT TIME. KNOWING THAT AT SOME POINT DOWN THE ROAD WE WOULD BE THE STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND EVENTUALLY WE WE WOULD BRING THEM INTO THE FOLD THIS WAS PLANNED ALLALONG THIS WAS IT WAS IT WAS UNDERSTOOD IN THE EARLY PLANNING STAGES. AND AND IT'S STILL OUR PLANET WHEN WHEN IT'S TIME TO REPLACE THOSE THE OUR PEACE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REPLACE MY PLAN IS TO ROLL THEM INTO FISCAL UNABLE TO HAVE FULL FUNCTIONALITY THAT POINT FACTOR UNDERLYING QUESTION. WELL THE LARGEST COST FOR US IS A STATE IS ON PERSONNEL AND IN A STAFFING ACOSTA WELL. WILL WE SEE THAT FROM A DEPARTMENT LEVEL. IT DOES THIS THE PERSONAL COSTS ARE IN THE BUDGET THEY'RE IN THE BUDGET ACT IN AND I WOULD JUST ADD ANOTHER THING TO DISCUSS BROUGHT TO US AND I THINK MISSES ME DON'T COVER IN OUR OPENING BUT THIS THE PAST THREE BUDGETS AND THIS NEXT BUDGET WHEN IT'S DONE -- WILL BE AT A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT BE DONE IN THE SYSTEM AND A LITTLE DETAIL TO THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PUBLIC THAT IS THE SAME UPDATE THAT WE PURCHASE PREVIOUSLY COULD ONLY PROVIDE THE JAN TEN BUDGET. SO -- SO THAT STUFF IS THERE AND IS AVAILABLE TO THE WORLD TO SEE THANK YOU. BEFORE WE WE DIG INTO OUR SECOND PANEL AND GET INTO THE DETAILS AROUND THIS STATE COUNTY AND OVERSIGHT. I DID JUST WANT TO CHECK IN WITH OUR OTHER PANELISTS AND SEE IF YOU HAVE. ANYTHING TO ADD -- AND THEN THE HIGHER LEVEL TOPIC AS FISCALES IMPLEMENTATION IN STATUS THAT YOU COULD BE USEFUL FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO NOW. JUST BRIEFLY WANTED TO SPEAK AS YOU MENTIONED THE CONTROLLERS LETTER SAID IN YOUR OPENING -- THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IS. FULLY COMMITTED TO SEEING THIS PROJECT THROUGH TO ITS COMPLETION AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION DOUBLE CONTROLLERS LETTER WAS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT. SHE WAS NOT COMMITTED. TO NOT SURE IF YOU'RE MIKE IS ON TRY THIS. ONE THIS ONE BETTER. OKAY SO THE CONTROLLERS LETTER WAS NO WAY INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT SHE IS NOT COMMITTED TO THE PROJECT -- OR THAT SHE FEELS THAT WE NEED TO BACK OUT OF THE PROJECT SHE IS FULLY COMMITTED. TO SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION. THE CONTROLLERS LETTER AND HER CONCERNS WERE BASICALLY AROUND SOME OF THE TIMELINESS ISSUES REGARDING THE BOOK A RECORD BECAUSE OF THE INTERFACES THAT WERE MENTIONED EARLIER -- AS WE MENTIONED THE INTERFACES CAUSED SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. TO THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE STAFF WERE SOME OF THE CASH REMITTANCES COULDN'T BE CAPTURED AS TIMELY AS WE WOULD HAVE NEEDED. TO ON THE LEGACY SIDE ON THE FOR THE BOOK A RECORD. AND THEREFORE WE PRODUCE THAT CASH REPORT THAT MONTH THE NUMBERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND THAN WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER REPORTS WERE SHOWING SUCH THAT'S WHAT HER CONCERN WAS ABOUT THAT WE NEED A TIME TO MAKE SURE. THAT THIS OUR WORKLOAD WAS ABLE TO BE PROCESSED WE NEED SOME ASSISTANCE FROM A PROJECT TO CREATE THESE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE NEEDED TO BE ABLE. TO GET THIS WORK DONE. AND WE NEED IT TO BE ABLE TO SLOW DOWN AND WE USE THE TERM STABILIZATION EVEN ON THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY ACCURATE STABILIZE THE SYSTEM IF YOU WILL. SO THAT THE CASH MANAGEMENT STAFF CAN ACTUALLY DO THEIR WORK AND HAVE. NUMBERS IN THE BOOK OF RECORD THAT THEY CAN TRUST THAT'S WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT. AND WE WORK TOGETHER WITH THE PROJECT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE DID COME UP WITH SOME SOLUTIONS TO TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. AND IT IS WORKING BETTER AT THE TIME THAT CASH MANAGEMENT STAFF WERE SPENDING IN PROCESSING REMITTANCES. HAS GONE DOWN FROM A MAXIMUM OF FIFTEEN DAYS AND WE'RE DOWN TO THREE DAYS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THE STABILIZATION EFFORT SO WE WANT TO GET DOWN TO ONE DAY WHICH IS WHAT OUR GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN. HOWEVER IT IS GETTING BETTER -- SO THAT'S WHAT THE LETTER WAS ABOUT IT WASN'T TO IMPLY THAT THE PROJECT IS A FAILURE OR TO IMPLY THAT WE'RE NOT COMMITTED TO IT AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE IT THROUGH. THESE INTERFACES THE PARALLEL SYSTEM THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED REALLY WHAT IT IS IS AN INTERFACE SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVE. SCO'S LEGACY SYSTEM INTERFACING WITH THE PASCAL SYSTEM AND TRANSACTIONS ARE FLYING BACK AND FORTH AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HAS CAUSED A LOT MORE NEED FOR RECONCILIATION. THERE'S A MUCH HIGHER RECONCILIATION WORKLOAD BECAUSE OF THAT. AND REALLY WERE TRYING TO FORCE TO SYSTEMS TO TALK TO EACH OTHER THAT. SOMETHING OTHER WHATEVER DESIGNED TO DO SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND HOW COMPLEX THAT IS AS WELL. SO ALL OF THAT TO SAY IS THAT WE'RE GETTING THERE AND BUT IT HAS. WE HAD HAD BUMPS IN THE ROAD AND THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WERE SURPRISED ABOUT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO SEEING THIS THROUGH. IF YOU LIKE. TO AT RIGHT MISS BAILEY -- WE DID PROVIDE A HAND UP FOR YOU ALL BUT GIVEN THE LARGE AMOUNT OF GROUND WE'VE COVERED ALREADY WILL TRY TO KEEP OUR COMMENTS SHORT -- JUST WANNA NOTE REGARDING KIND OF THE THE PROJECT PLAN WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING UNDER S. P. R. SEVEN WE KNOW S. P. R. EIGHT IS -- UNDER REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY C. T. -- BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT UNDER S. PAIR SEVEN JULY TWENTY NINETEEN WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE END DATE FOR THE PROJECT AND AS WE NOTED IN OUR ANALYSIS WE FOUND THAT TO BE A RATHER ARBITRARY IN DAY FOR THE PROJECT GIVEN YOU DO HAVE ALL THESE DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE. GONNA BE COMING ON AFTERWARDS AS WELL AS YOU'RE SEEING NOW BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS COMING IN TO GIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DEPARTMENTS ACTUALLY USE THE SYSTEM AND SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING COSTS FOR THIS PROJECT GOING FORWARD. WE ALSO WOULDN'T WANT TO GLOSS OVER THE FACT THAT THE INTEGRATED SOLUTION IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT THOUGH THIS PROJECT IS STILL A HUMAN CHANGE MANAGEMENT EFFORT. INTEGRATED SOLUTION IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE PROJECT AND THERE ARE STABILIZATION AND SUPPORT EFFORTS UNDER WAY FOR THAT TO WORK FOR THINGS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED AND THERE IS ADDITIONAL WORK TO DO FOR THE REMAINING MILESTONES -- WE DO ALSO WANT TO NOTE AGAIN AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED THE ISSUES AROUND THE MONTH AND YEAR AND CLOSE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THERE ARE AT LEAST FIFTEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD TO SUBMIT ESTIMATED STATEMENTS ACCORDING THE STEERING COMMITTEE DOCUMENTS IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FORTY FIVE DEPARTMENTS COULD BE SUBMITTING ESTIMATES. FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE CONTINUE CHALLENGES USING THE SYSTEM THAT NUMBER COULD GO UP -- AND THOSE DEPARTMENTS THAT WERE UNABLE TO CLOSE FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE -- TROUBLE FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN SO THERE COULD BE ONGOING RAMIFICATIONS OF NOT CLOSING THE BOOKS ON TIME -- WE ALSO AGAIN AS WE MENTIONED CONTINUE TO SEE REQUEST FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND RESOURCES FOR DEPARTMENTS WE NOTED AT LEAST. TWELVE THREE NINETEEN TWENTY THOSE ARE NOT BEING CATALOGUED IN ANY CONSISTENT WAY AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF THE PROJECT COSTS THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THEM BEING CONTINUING COSTS. AS YOU NEED TO AUGMENT RESOURCES FOR DEPARTMENTS -- AND AGAIN I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO ANALYZING AS P. R. EIGHT AND PROVIDING ANALYSIS TO THE LEGISLATURE -- BUT AGAIN THOSE CONCERNS REMAIN FROM S. PAIR. SEVEN TO S. P. R. EIGHT AS IT'S BEEN SCOPED. OUT. HAS THE PROJECT COMPLETING JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY I BELIEVE. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATION ON THE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS THATHAVE BEEN DEFERRED. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOUND LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE. COMPLETE BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY SO THE THE PROJECT AS IT IS YOU KNOW IDENTIFIED IN THE F. S. R. AND THEN THE SUBSEQUENT S. P. R.'S. IDENTIFIED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO DEPARTMENTS TO BE UTILIZING THE SYSTEM AND THEN ALL OF THE FUNCTIONALITY TO BE BUILT. THAT IS THE FISCAL PROJECT. SO WHEN THAT IS DONE THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE WILL NOT CONTINUE TO HAVE ENHANCEMENT WORK NOR DOES IT SAY THAT WE WILL NOT BE IN A POSITION TO HAVE TO ON BOARD DEPARTMENTS. AT A LATER DATE WHAT I DID YOU KNOW INDICATE WAS IT SURELY I WOULD NEED -- YOU KNOW BE SEE PEOPLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO BRING ON SOME OF THESE LARGER -- DEFERRED DEPARTMENTS WHAT MAY ALSO HAPPEN IS DEPENDING ON WHAT THAT GAP ANALYSIS SHOWS. IF I NEED TO DO ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY OR CHANGE THE SYSTEM IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY BUT I WOULD ALSO AT THAT POINT TRIGGER ANOTHER -- PROJECT AND SO WE WOULD HAVE. THE PROJECT TO IMPLEMENT YOU KNOW EITHER. CDC ARE CALTRANS AND AND THAT WOULD BE TRACKED AND AND HAVE OVERSIGHT. ON ITS OWN AS A PROJECT OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE COULD BE A FIFTY CAL PHASE TWO OR PHASE CALIPHATES THREE AS IT WERE. AND THE MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET BELL I THINK IT'S MEN LIKE SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS [inaudible] THAT. DOES NOT COVERED THE ON BOARDING OF THAT ANY OF THESE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS OR ANY THE PROJECT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. CORRECT WE'RE NOT INCLUDE WELL THESE AND WE BELIEVE WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BRING ON CD T. WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SMALL DEPARTMENT. I'M IN. TWENTY TWENTY ARE AND THEY DON'T REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY THAT'S A KEY PIECES THAT HAVE IT'S THEY'RE GOING TO COME ON UTILIZING WHAT WE HAVE. STEFAN I JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON WITH THE CHAIR ASKED INTO WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE WITH S. P. R. A. THAT'S FINISHING -- THE FINAL COMPONENTS OF THE ONE UNDER THE FOR AGENCIES THEN DO YOU ANTICIPATE LIKE AS P. R. NINE FOR ALL THE OTHER ONES I EXPECTED NEW PROJECT. SO YOU CAN PLAY THE NEW PRODUCT COMPLETELY NEW PROJECT SO IT WOULD BE ABOVE THE SCOPE THAT WE ORIGINALLY SET OUT TO DO WE ARE NOW. AT IT WOULD BE A PROJECT TO BRING ON CALTRANS AND WHATEVER ADDITIONAL MODULES THEY MAY NEED. AND I LIKE I WOULD JUST ADD THAT WE WOULD BRING THAT PROJECT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL SURELY WOULDN'T JUST DO THAT. YOU KNOW I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD IN TERMS OF AND AND IN IN. IN JUST FOLLOWING UP WITH THE WITH THE LEAD LINE ARRAYS -- LINE OF QUESTIONING BY THE CHAIR IS THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ALLOWING A LOT OF THESE -- THAT YOU FOLKS WOULD INTO INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE TO TO LEAVE I GUESS AGAIN OF JUST BRING THEM BACK AND WHEN WE JUST. CONTINUE TO UTILIZE THEM OVER -- SO I'M TO TO WORK OUT WE HAVE -- DIFFERENT AGENCIES RIGHT SO WE HAVE BEEN HAD A CONTRACT WITH OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATOR IN PLACE SENSE SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE AND UNDER THE YOU KNOW ACQUISITION -- OR THE PROCUREMENT RULES OF THE STATE WE WOULD WANT TO GO OUT TO LOOK FOR A COMPETITIVE BID SO BY CONTINUALLY EXTENDING THE PROJECT. BY NECESSITY WE HAVE BEEN EXTENDING THE CONTRACT WITH WITH OUR SYSTEM INTEGRATOR INTO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT AGAIN. WE MAY. YOU DON'T BRING THEM BACK IS YOU KNOW DOWN THE ROAD IN AND SAY IT YOU ARE THE MOST QUALIFIED AND AND YOU KNOW IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE TO BRING YOU BACK EITHER PRICE PLANER. OR WHAT THEY CAN BRING BUT UNTIL WE PUT IT OUT -- INTO THE COMPETITIVE TO THE NEW BID FOR THE THERE WOULD BE A NEW AND EXCITING THANK YOU. AND THEN AT MISTER THE JHANA FROM CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WOULD LOVE. TO GET YOUR YOUR TAKE ON ON THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT GOOD MORNING I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- JUST SPEAKER COOKIE TO ASPIRATE SO WHEN. DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND FISCAL GOT TOGETHER AND DETERMINED THAT THE SCOPE AND SCHEDULE NEEDED TO PREPAY THREE BASS LINE. WE BEGAN WORKING WITH THEM ON THE DIFFERENT ITEMS THAT WE'VE LAID OUT THAT NEEDED TO BE. REMEDIATED. N. FISCALE AT THAT TIME ACTUALLY STARTED ON THAT REMEDIATION RIGHT AWAY IT WASN'T AS IF THEY JUST SAT BACK AND STARTED DRAWING OF THAT DOCUMENTS. LIKE THE DIRECTORS SPOKE TO THEIR TICKETS FOR UP TO ABOUT THREE THOUSAND AT THREE MONTHS AGO AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING THAT DOWN TO TWO THOUSAND AND THE TREND SEEMS TO KEEP GOING THAT WAY -- IN PART OF THAT IS LOOKING FOR TRENDS ON WHAT'S GOING ON HERE THAT IF THEY IF THEY WERE DEFECTS CONFIGURATION ISSUES ARE JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THE SYSTEM AND I NEED SOME HELP -- THAT. THE MOVING OF DEPARTMENT CAL STARS DEPARTMENTS OFFER CAL STARS AN ITEM THAT WE BROUGHT UP -- IN. THE PROJECT GOT ON THAT IN ACTION LIKE THE DARK SO I THINK THERE'S ONLY FOUR LEFT AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL BE DONE BY AT LEAST JULY OF THIS YEAR -- SO JUST GOING OVER THE SB ARE REAL QUICK SO THEY ARE REDUCING SOME OF THE THE SCOPE THAT IS IDENTIFIED AS NOT CRITICAL FOR THEIR MINIMUM MINIMUM MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT. SO THE AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION TO WORK SO THEY'RE JUST LOOKING AT THAT THAT FUNCTIONALITY NEEDS NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE -- THE REMAINING SCOPE AS MENTIONED WILL BE DONE IN  MINNOW OR IF IT REQUIRES OF THE PROJECT THAT WILL BE BROUGHT FORWARD IN GO THROUGH THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS. THEY'VE EXTENDED THIS GET ABOUT ONE YEAR -- AGAIN THAT MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT SHOULD BE DONE BY JULY TWENTY TWENTY AND THEY'VE ALSO EXTENDED THE PRODUCTION SUPPORT FROM ACCENTURE SO. THE SI WILL BE THERE TO HELP WITH PRODUCTION SUPPORT AND THE EXCEPT THE SYSTEM EXPECTANT OF THIS THE X.. SYSTEM ACCEPTANCE IS EXPECTED TO BE BACK IN -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO RESOURCES. FROM THE STATE SIDE THE SEEM TO REMAIN THE SAME THEY'VE ADDED SOME CONTRACT -- MONIES -- IN ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE ALSO DONE IS THEY'VE CREATED SOME DEDICATED TEAMS TO WORK ON SPECIFICALLY THE DEVELOPMENT. BEFORE THEY HAD TEAM A TEAM THAT WERE SPLIT SO IF THEY HAD ISSUES IN THE PRODUCTION AREA THIS TEAM MEMBERS WOULD SPLIT OFF FROM THE PRODUCTION AND GO WORK ON PRODUCTION. NOW THEY HAVE A TEAM DEDICATED FOR PRODUCTION AND THE TEAM DEDICATED FOR THE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OF THE SYSTEM SO ISSUE UP. THE SYSTEM FUNCTIONALITY -- SO ALL IN ALL WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM ON THE APPROVALS WE EXPECT THAT TO BE DONE SOMETIME THIS WEEK HOWEVER THERE ARE STILL SOME CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON WHICH ONCE WE GET THE FINAL DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE S. P. R. AND THAT. WE SEE NO PROBLEMS WITH THAT -- APPROVAL GOING TO QUICKLY. OKAY THANK YOU SO. SAID MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN YOU DID YOUR LATEST PROJECT OVERSIGHT REPORT IN THE CONTEXT OF A TARGET. DELIVERY DATE OF JULY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN THE PROJECT WAS READ AND WAS NOT ON TRACK TO SATISFIED CUSTOMERS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES CHIEF OBJECTIVES AND IMPROVE TIME FRAME. OUR OBJECTIVES WITHIN APPROVED BUDGET. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE'VE RESCRIPT THE PROJECT TO ME BASS LINE TO TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT? THE NEW PROJECT WOULD NOT BE IN THE RED STATUS CORRECT A CONTENT AND BEING IN THE RED DOES THAT MEAN FAILURE MEANS ARE AT MEANS ITEMS NEED TO BE CORRECTED. AND AND THEY'VE DONE THAT THROUGH THE S. P. R. PROCESS AND TO THE ACTIONS THEY'VE TAKEN SINCE JANUARY TO THIS DAY. AND THEN I'VE GOT SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU LAID OUT WITH WITH A MILE STERN'S -- SO THE FIRST MILESTONE MORE MILES AND TO I GUESS STATEWIDE DEPOSITS FUNCTIONALITY WHICH WAS DEPLOYED IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THAT STILL EXPERIENCING STABILIZATION ISSUES -- IS UP AND RESOLVED. SAID THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- TO AND I DON'T KNOW. THAT. TO THE MISTER LOIS HADN'T HAD MADE REFERENCE TO AS WELL AND AND I HAD ALLUDED TO IS THAT WHEN WE BROUGHT ON SOME OF THOSE FUNCTIONALITIES WE INCREASED THE WORKLOAD. AT AT HOME AT HOME WE CALL WOMEN WHEN THEY'RE IN THE THE THE FOUR PARTNERS AGENCIES BACKGROUND -- INTO SOME OF THOSE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS -- I THAT THE STABILIZATION WITH -- BESIDES. BESIDES THE THAT INTEGRATION I DON'T THINK THAT THERE IS ANYTHING LEFT ON ON MILESTONE TO WHITE AND I CAN GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC ITEM THAT THAT WAS DONE SO WHAT THE PROJECT IT IS THEY STREAMLINED THEIR BATCH PROCESSES. AND PARTLY THEY ACTUALLY BROKEN UP INTO SMALLER PIECES SO THAT WAS MORE EASILY TO HANDLE SO. IF YOU HAD A HUGE BATCH PROCESS THAT WAS RUNNING AND YOU HAD A PROBLEM SAY THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY FACT IT WOULD CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR THE BROKEN UP INTO SMALLER CHUNKS OF THAT. I'D BE MUCH MORE EFFICIENT. AT AND THEN THE RELEASE ONE INTO WHICH IS DEPLOYED IN DECEMBER. TWENTY EIGHTEEN IS THAT STILL EXPERIENCING CIVILIZATION ISSUES ARE HAVE THOSE BEEN RESOLVED ACTUALLY THOSE ARE RELATED TO MILESTONE TWO AND THREE THOSE ARE ALSO OKAY THOSE ARE RELATED MOUSE AND FOUR AND FIVE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE RE BASS LINES. AND HE'S GOT A I GOT. SO WITH THAT I THINK PERHAPS WE WILL TRANSITION. TO A PANEL TO WHICH IS IN STATE ACCOUNT TEAM AND OVERSIGHT. AND A HAVE AND STILL HAND. AS PART OF FINANCING WITH US MR LOW LAST -- FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE THANK YOU AND YOUR AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I AND THEN WE'LL ADD LARRY SATCHER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL. SO I GUESS THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION -- IN THIS CASE THE TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION IS OF COURSE ENSURING THAT THAT THE SYSTEM CAN ACCURATELY -- SPORT AVERAGE AT USE THE STATE'S FINANCIAL KEY FINANCIAL REPORTS AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AS ALLUDED TO SOME OF THAT THE CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCERNS. WOULD JUST LOVE TO GET I THINK EITHER YOUR UPDATE ON WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS AT OUR LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE THAT. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY PRODUCE THE CALF ANOTHER. OTHER KEY REPORTS SURE ALL UP KICK IT OFF HERE AND AND LET MY COLLEAGUES ON THE PANEL JUMPED IN AS THEY SEE FIT BUT BUT WHAT. THIS WHOLE. RE BASELINE IN THE PROJECT WAS -- WAS AN EFFORT IS PART OF CHANGE MANAGEMENT ALSO IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT'S THE CONTROLLERS IN A POSITION TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN A CUT OVER AND SO. THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING -- MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE TIME TO TEST THE PIECES THEY NEED TO TEST THAT THE FUNCTIONALITIES THERE -- WITH RESPECT TO THE CATHARINE OTHER PIECES AND AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE THOUGHT WOULD PROPOSE A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA SPEND THIS NEXT YEAR GETTING THEM READY. TO CUT OVER -- AND THEN WE'RE GONNA RUN THEIR SYSTEM PARALLEL. SO THEY CAN. DO THAT SECOND THAT NEXT CATHERINE AND HAVE AND HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THAT WHAT'S BEEN WITHOUT ONE SYSTEM TYPES WHAT'S PRODUCED A LEGACY SYSTEM. AND AT THAT POINT WE CAN SHUT IT DOWN BUT I FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE -- WE'VE LEARNED A LOT AND AND AND WITH THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE AS I SAID WE'RE WE'RE GET WEIRD BEEN DEPLOYING OUR RESOURCES MORE TARGETED TO HELP THOSE DEPARTMENTS WERE TO GET THE BEST VALUE -- AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE. WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP US WITH IN THE SPRING -- WHEN THOSE COME ON BOARD UNTIL I WE'RE GOING TO DO THE SAME SO? AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE YOU WANNA TOWARD. YEAH THIRTY SETTER WITH FINANCE AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT -- WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE PROJECT ON PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL TRAINING TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO HELP THEM GET CURRENT IN CLOSING WE THINK THAT THAT'LL BE A SUCCESS FACTOR WHEN IT'S TIME TO PRODUCE THE KAFIRS MAKING SURE THAT DEPARTMENTS ARE CLOSING IN A TIMELY MANNER. SO INVESTING A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT INTO THEM. WHAT I WANT TO ADD IS THAT? ONCE WE'RE DONE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THIS WILL WORK. I THINK ONCE WE'RE DONE IT WILL WORK -- IT'S WORKED AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IT'S WORKED IN OTHER STATES. EVEN THE WERE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN ALL OF THOSE I THINK IT WILL WORK. WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE AS MISTER GILL AND SAID THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED THE TRAINING THAT WE NEED AND EVERYTHING EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN. ONE OTHER THING THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE MISTER SATURN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER IS THE WAY WE DO ACCOUNTING POLICY -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FINANCE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE DEPARTMENTS WELL THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE REPORTING POLICY. IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE BUDGETARY LEGAL REPORT AND THE KAFFIR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ON ON BOTH SIDES OF THE EQUATION -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND YOU SYSTEM BECAUSE NOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE IN ONE SYSTEM WE'RE NOT GONNA BE USING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS. AND ASKING DEPARTMENTS TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS SO IN THAT RESPECT WE HAVE STARTED WORKING TOGETHER WE WORK VERY CLOSELY IN MAKING SURE THAT WHATEVER POLICIES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ISSUES THE DEPARTMENTS ARE THINGS THAT. WE CAN LIVE WITH AND THAT WILL WORK FOR US AS WELL. AND WE'RE DOING THE SAME ONE WE HAVE REPORTING POLICIES AND DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE NEED FROM DEPARTMENTS ARE TO PRODUCE THE FINANCIALS. THAT IT WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND WORKS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL SO AGAIN IT'S GONNA REQUIRE MORE COLLABORATION WE HAVE STARTED THAT. TO TAKE THEM BACK TO A QUESTION I HAD ASKED EARLIER IN THE WEEK BE TABLED FOR THAT SO. ARE THERE ENTITIES THAT ARE REPORTING CONCERNS WITH USING FISCALE. I BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCERN ABOUT. SYSTEM ACCURACY IN MEETING FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AS OF RIGHT NOW THE ONLY DEPARTMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAS RAISE THAT CONCERN IN IN MAY AND MAY STILL BE A LITTLE BIT CURRENT HIS PARCEL SERVICES THEY ARE ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS USING CAL STARS. AND THEY WANTED TO USE THAT IN PART TO HELP THEM VALIDATE THE FEDERAL REPORTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PRODUCED OUT OF FISCAL -- I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY INDICATION FROM THEM THAT THEY WILL NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT THEY IT WAS A TOOL THAT THEY WANTED TO USE TO HELP THEM ENSURE. THAT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT FED THE FEDERAL REPORTING. OKAY SO THEY'RE KIND OF RUNNING TO DO ALL APPROACH THAT AT THE MOMENT. THAT'S CORRECT. I'M AND THEN. AGAIN BACK TO THE QUESTION OF SORT OF LEVEL OF DETAIL. THAT -- THAT THIS GAL THE SYSTEM IS CAPABLE OF SO I THINK THE DIRECTORIES AS THE EXAMPLE OF OF APPLE APPLES RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE CLASSIFYING SAVVY CAN. NEW START WITH FOOD AND FRUIT AND VEGETABLES APPLES YOU HAVE GALA APPLES OR YOU CAN EXPRESS. HOW? LIKE WE HAVE TO HAVE A AN APPROACH TO SELECTING WHAT LEVEL OF GRANULARITY WE WANT AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE THAN USING THAT SAME LEVEL OF GRANULARITY. THAT ACTUALLY STRIKES ME AS QUITE A MASSIVE. UNDERTAKING WHAT IS OUR APPROACH TO THAT RIGHT NOW AND AND HOW ARE WE INSURING THAT SAM. THE DEPARTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE OPERATING IN UNIFORM FASHION. WELL I'LL TAKE A FIRST CUT AT IT -- OUR APPROACH WAS THAT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU THAT. WE GOT CAUGHT OFF GUARD -- BUT BY THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IN ON THE PROCUREMENT SIDE AND THE THE WORKLOAD THAT THEY PUT ON A DEPARTMENTS AND SO AS A STEERING COMMITTEE AS IS CONTROL AGENCIES WE CAME TOGETHER SO WHAT WE DO ABOUT THIS AND SO WE BACK CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS IN THE SHORT TERM. SO WE DIDN'T CRUSH THE STATE'S BECOME A PROCESS -- WELL WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO D. G. S. AND CONTROLLER IN PARTICULAR BUT WHAT WE'RE INVOLVED THE IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT A PROJECT ISSUE PER SE IT'S MORE OF A POLICY CALL -- BUT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE WE FIND WHAT WHAT IS BUT WE DO WE THINK THAT RIGHT LEVEL DETAIL IS AN AND ONCE WEEK SORT OF LAND THAT WE WILL ENGAGE WITH THE LEGISLATURE -- BECAUSE YOU HAVE SOME EXPECTATIONS OF OF TRANSPARENCY OUT OF THE SYSTEM AND AND WE'RE SHOWCASING SOME OF THAT IN A PILOT RIGHT NOW OF ON THE PROCUREMENT SIDE LIKE. WHAT DEPARTMENTS PURCHASE AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL DETAIL -- SO IN THAT CONTEXT WE WOULD WE WOULD COME BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE THINKS IS RIGHT LEVEL DETAIL BUT YOU KNOW WE WE DON'T THANK LEAST FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE DON'T THINK IT THESE IN THE APPLE ANALOGY THAT'S THAT'S BEEN USED FAR TOO OFTEN BUT BUT BUT WE DON'T THINK IT MATTERS IF IT'S A GREEN APPLE OR FOOD. THE APPLE OR MACINTOSH APPLE OR OR BRAEBURN YOU KNOW THAT -- IT'S WHAT WHAT WHAT THAT WHAT WHAT FOOD WE BUYING FOR OUR TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE FACILITIES OUR PRISONS AND HOW MUCH WE'RE PAYING FOR IT WHERE WE SOURCING IT AND WE GETTING THE BEST VALUE FOR THE STATEMENT THAT'S THAT'S A SORT INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO NOW -- IS AN ADMINISTRATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE I WOULD ASSUME WANTS TO KNOW FROM AN OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE ON AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THAT NEEDLE IF YOU WILL RIGHT AND THEN IT'S JUST ENSURING THAT THAN THE BUSINESS ROLES ARE. THE SENATE WILL ENSURE THE BUSINESS RULES THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY WHAT AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHY IT BECAME AN ISSUE ON THE FRONT END AND HAVE. THE RIGHT. AND ON THE BACK AND IT'S ALSO GOING TO FOLLOW IN OUR CLAREMONT IT'S FOLKS WHEN THEY'RE APPROVING THE VOUCHERS FOR PAYMENT THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO SEE THE DETAILS. AS WELL SO THE SYSTEM GONNA REQUIRED THEN THEY'RE GONNA MIGHT BE SURE THAT IT'S IN THE VOUCHER INFORMATION BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY ALLOW THAT WARRANT TO BE ISSUED. AB AND I THINK ONE LAST QUESTION FOR ME ON THIS ON ON THIS TOPIC THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MENTIONED THAT THERE FORTY FIVE DEPARTMENTS -- THE REASON ESTIMATES FOR CLOSING I BELIEVE IS THE NUMBER. DOES THAT GIVE YOU PAUSE OR A CAUSE FOR CONCERN. SO AS AN ACCOUNTANT I CAN NEVER SAY THAT THAT ONE GIVE ME CAUSE FOR CONCERN BUT ESTIMATES ANOTHER NEW THINGS WE'VE HAD DEPARTMENTS DOING ESTIMATES IN THEIR OLD LEGACY SYSTEMS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AS WELL -- NOT AS MANY GRANTED BUT IT HAS HAPPENED IT'S NOT A NEW THING. UP THE DEPARTMENT ARE GOING TO DO ESTIMATES THIS YEAR ARE NOT MATERIAL. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW NOW WHETHER THE STATE AUDITOR AGREES WITH THAT STATEMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE THEIR CALL. I THINK WE'LL BE FINE BUT HAVING ESTIMATES IS NOT NECESSARILY A BAD THING AS LONG AS THEY CAN DEFEND THOSE ESTIMATES AND WHEN THE AUDITOR WALKS INTO THEIR OFFICE TO SAY HEY. YOU GUYS PROVIDED ESTIMATES HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THAT SHOW ME HOW YOU CAME UP WITH IT. AND SEE IF THEY'RE SATISFIED IF THEY CAN SATISFY THE AUDITOR. WILL BE FINE -- BUT AGAIN ESTIMATES ARE NOT A NEW THING HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE MINIMAL AND HOPEFULLY AS WE MOVE FORWARD WILL HAVE LESS AND LESS AND HOPEFULLY AT SOME POINT. NINE AND I JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT -- ONE OF THE EFFORTS BROKE THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CONTROLLER AND THE STATE AUDITOR. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES TO DEPARTMENTS WHO HAVE TO DO ESTIMATES TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE DONE. ACCURATELY ACCURACY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN REGARDS TO THOSE ESTIMATES -- EVERY DEPARTMENT USES ESTIMATES FOR YOUR AND REPORTING PURPOSES THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE DEPARTMENTS ARE A LITTLE BIT BEHIND OF FISCALES ARE AT A DIFFERENT STARTING POINT. SO WHICH COULD HELP THEM KIND OF DEFECTIVE DEVELOP THAT PROCESS AND ENSURE THAT IT'S ACCURATE. ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD ADD. JUST IN TERMS OF OF OVERSIGHT. I IN THE CONTEXT OF A SCALE. NO I WOULD I WOULD SAY -- YOU KNOW WHAT WE APPRECIATE THE ENGAGEMENT STAFF -- YOUR STAFF REACH OUT TO US OFTEN -- AND AND HAVE ONGOING DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS PROJECT WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT. THE MOVE WE'VE BEEN HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES YOU KNOW HADN'T HAND ASKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES BRING US AND CROSS THE FINISH LINE AND AND LET SUCH AS BEEN EVERY TIME SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE LOOK FORWARD. TO TO THE COMING BACK NEXT CHEN TUNG WHERE WE ARE AND HAVING THEM CONTINUOUS PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION. WELL THANK YOU AND THANK YOU AND ALL OF OUR PANELISTS AND HAVE JOIN US TWENTIES TODAY AND AND TAKING TIME TO UPDATE THE COMMITTEE. COMMITTEES ON ON THE PROJECT STATUS. I THINK I'M FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THINK LIKE WE SAID THIS IS HAS BEEN A TRULY MASSIVE UNDERTAKING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I THINK A LOT HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED WE'VE CERTAINLY. SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE A A FAIR WAYS TO GO WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF OF THE THE SUBSEQUENT FACE SAYS. AND I WAS STRUCK IN YOUR TESTIMONY I THINK BY THE NUMBER OF LESSONS. THE REASONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND MUCH WITH THE PROCESS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES ON UP TO KEEP RELEARNING THOSE LESSONS RIGHT BECAUSE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING. TO KEEP ON TAKING ON GIGANTIC. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER LARGE SCALE PROJECTS AND I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS YOU HIGHLIGHTED AROUND. FACT THAT YEAH IT'S NEVER JUST A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT IT'S A IT'S A HUGE CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROJECT. THAT IS SO IMPORTANT -- SOME OF THE THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT. IN TERMS OF THE ROLL OUT AS AND VERY DIFFUSE PROJECT ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND SEEN THE SPIKY NESS. OF SIX ASSN FOR YOU'RE NOT A RIGHT ACTUALLY IF WE CAN ADOPT THIS IS A BEST PRACTICE. THEN WE CAN ENSURE THAT EVERYONE. IS HAVING A SUCCESSFUL ROLLOUT SO. I'M THE ONE THING THAT I THINK WOULD BE REALLY VERY VALUABLE IS PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE THEY HI THE TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION GROUP THAT'S GONNA BE STARTING UP IS TO ENSURE THAT. AS THIS PROJECT WINDS DOWN THAT THERE'S A REALLY THOROUGH KIND OF DEBRIEF AND AND REFLECTION SO THAT WE WE CAN TAKE EVERYTHING THAT. AT THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGHOUT THIS JOURNEY AND DIED AND APPLY IT TO FUTURE PROJECTS -- LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL IS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF A OF THE PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. AND LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING AND UPDATES -- AN UPDATE ON PROJECT STATUS AS WELL. WITH THAT I THINK WE ARE ADJOURNED [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] QUESTION. COME ONE RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME AND NINETY EIGHT THANK YOU SO
