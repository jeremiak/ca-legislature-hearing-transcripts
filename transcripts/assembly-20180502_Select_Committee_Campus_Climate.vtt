AND THE THE ISSUE AT THAT POINT

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.636 region:rollup2

00:21:42.134 --> 00:21:45.938 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF A LACK OF OVERSIGHT

00:21:43.636 --> 00:21:47.740 region:rollup2

ON THAT PARTICULAR CAMPUS.

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.376 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT OF THAT THIS COULD

00:21:48.841 --> 00:21:51.977 region:rollup2
THIS PSALM.

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:53.646 region:rollup2

OR IS ANTICIPATED SUBMIT AND I

00:22:09.829 --> 00:22:13.799 region:rollup2
SUBMIT BEHAVIOR UCLA WHILE WE

GOT A CROWN THE STATE RAISING

00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:18.571 region:rollup2
ISSUES OF OF CONCERN.

00:22:16.235 --> 00:22:20.139 region:rollup2
TODAY'S TOPIC IS ADDRESSING

HOMELESSNESS HUNGER AND

00:22:20.139 --> 00:22:23.275 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS IN THE PUBLIC

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.211 region:rollup2
HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:26.245 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT AN UNFAMILIAR

00:22:25.211 --> 00:22:28.113 region:rollup2
TOPIC TO MANY OF YOU BECAUSE

00:22:26.245 --> 00:22:30.482 region:rollup2
YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS

00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:31.617 region:rollup2
ISSUE AND DOING AS I WANT TO SAY

00:22:30.482 --> 00:22:34.053 region:rollup2
REALLY IN A FANTASTIC JOB.

00:22:31.617 --> 00:22:35.454 region:rollup2
IN NOVEMBER TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS

00:22:34.053 --> 00:22:36.222 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE HELD ITS VERY FIRST

00:22:35.454 --> 00:22:37.957 region:rollup2
HEARING AT SENDING STATE

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:40.192 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY ON STUDENT FOOD

00:22:37.957 --> 00:22:42.161 region:rollup2
INSECURITY AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:43.262 region:rollup2
WE HAD NO IDEA THAT AT THAT TIME

00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:44.997 region:rollup2
THAT IT WOULD BECOME SUCH A

00:22:43.262 --> 00:22:46.065 region:rollup2
MAJOR ISSUE. OF THROUGHOUT THE

00:22:44.997 --> 00:22:47.499 region:rollup2
STATE BUT WE HAVE BEEN

00:22:46.065 --> 00:22:47.900 region:rollup2
APPROACHED ABOUT IT BECAUSE

00:22:47.499 --> 00:22:49.401 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY.

00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:51.704 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND FOOD

00:22:49.401 --> 00:22:52.671 region:rollup2
INSECURITY HAS A PROFOUND IMPACT

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:54.773 region:rollup2
ON THE LIFE OF STUDENTS AND

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:56.775 region:rollup2
UPLAND OBVIOUSLY THE CLIMATE THE

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:57.243 region:rollup2
CAMPUS ITSELF IN TERMS OF HOW

00:22:56.775 --> 00:22:59.345 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO

00:22:57.243 --> 00:23:00.713 region:rollup2
MATRICULATED. FROM ONE YEAR TO

00:22:59.345 --> 00:23:02.348 region:rollup2
THE NEXT EXCESSIVELY IN ORDER TO

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:03.949 region:rollup2
GRADUATE AND SO THAT IS A MAJOR

00:23:02.348 --> 00:23:06.018 region:rollup2
CONCERN IS THERE. WE HEARD FROM

00:23:03.949 --> 00:23:07.853 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AND CAMPUS OFFICIALS

00:23:06.018 --> 00:23:09.588 region:rollup2
FROM SCHOOLS IN SAN DIEGO AND

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:11.657 region:rollup2
AROUND THE SAN DIEGO AREA THAT

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:13.259 region:rollup2
EXPOSED US TO HOW DIFFICULT IT

00:23:11.657 --> 00:23:14.560 region:rollup2
WAS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.395 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS. SOMETIMES ON

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.596 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES BECAUSE OF LEGISLATION

00:23:16.395 --> 00:23:19.164 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE ALL

00:23:17.596 --> 00:23:20.065 region:rollup2
THE RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.333 region:rollup2
GOVERN US.

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.668 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN INTERESTING BECAUSE

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:24.136 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME AS A RESULT WE

00:23:22.668 --> 00:23:25.437 region:rollup2
UNCOVERED A LOT OF THINGS THAT

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:26.639 region:rollup2
NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED WHETHER

00:23:25.437 --> 00:23:28.007 region:rollup2
IT WAS DEALING WITH THE FOOD

00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:29.909 region:rollup2
BANKS AND MAKING IT POSSIBLE.

00:23:28.007 --> 00:23:30.576 region:rollup2
FOR CAMPUSES TO ACTUALLY GET

00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:33.078 region:rollup2
FOOD FROM FOOD BANKS SINCE THEY

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:33.879 region:rollup2
WORK NONPROFIT AGENCIES OR

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.180 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S.

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:36.582 region:rollup2
LOOKING THE CAMPUS IS A WE HAVE

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.684 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A BILL THIS YEAR THIS

00:23:36.582 --> 00:23:40.286 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT ALL CAMPUSES THAT

00:23:38.684 --> 00:23:42.288 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE CAO FRESH PROGRAMS IN

00:23:40.286 --> 00:23:43.889 region:rollup2
THEIR COUNTIES. AND HOW DO WE

00:23:42.288 --> 00:23:45.224 region:rollup2
GET THOSE CAL FRESH OF

00:23:43.889 --> 00:23:46.659 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES TO YOUNG PEOPLE

00:23:45.224 --> 00:23:48.294 region:rollup2
THERE SO WE HAVE LEGISLATION

00:23:46.659 --> 00:23:50.429 region:rollup2
THAT OPEN IT UP OPENS IT UP FOR

00:23:48.294 --> 00:23:53.732 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO. ACTUALLY GET OF CAO

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:54.233 region:rollup2
FRESH FROM STATE AND IF THERE

00:23:53.732 --> 00:23:54.600 region:rollup2
COUNTY DOESN'T HAVE IT.

00:23:54.233 --> 00:23:56.635 region:rollup2
SO THIS YEAR.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.937 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THAT SO TWENTY FOUR

00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:59.672 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS SURVEYED

00:23:57.937 --> 00:24:01.140 region:rollup2
GO OUT NEARLY ONE IN FOUR HAVE

00:23:59.672 --> 00:24:02.508 region:rollup2
FOOD AND SECURITIES. AND THE

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.575 region:rollup2
SAME STUDY ALSO SHOWED THE TEN

00:24:02.508 --> 00:24:04.743 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF C. ISSUE STUDENTS

00:24:03.575 --> 00:24:06.879 region:rollup2
WERE HOMELESS.

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:08.781 region:rollup2
THE UC STUDY SHOWED THAT NEARLY

00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:10.816 region:rollup2
ONE OF FIVE STUDENTS AT ISSUES

00:24:08.781 --> 00:24:12.251 region:rollup2
WITH FOOD INSECURITY. A YEAR AGO

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:13.452 region:rollup2
INTO A SIXTEEN THE SELECT

00:24:12.251 --> 00:24:14.687 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE THOUGH IT GIVES AN

00:24:13.452 --> 00:24:16.588 region:rollup2
UPDATE ON WHAT SOME OF THE C.

00:24:14.687 --> 00:24:17.556 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND YOU SEE SAID I HAVE

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:19.491 region:rollup2
BEEN DOING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:24:17.556 --> 00:24:20.326 region:rollup2
DOING TODAY. TO ALSO GET AN

00:24:19.491 --> 00:24:21.427 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL UPDATE.

00:24:20.326 --> 00:24:22.928 region:rollup2
SINCE THE STUDY THERE HAS BEEN

00:24:21.427 --> 00:24:24.530 region:rollup2
CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:26.165 region:rollup2
TO THE BASIC NEEDS OF STUDENTS

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.666 region:rollup2
WITH THE SEGMENTS RESPONDING IN

00:24:26.165 --> 00:24:29.301 region:rollup2
VARIOUS WAYS.

00:24:27.666 --> 00:24:30.669 region:rollup2
STUDENTS STAFF AND FACULTY LIKE

00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.304 region:rollup2
HAVE GALVANIZED AND RALLIED

00:24:30.669 --> 00:24:33.605 region:rollup2
AROUND THESE ISSUES AND I FIND A

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:35.207 region:rollup2
VERY HARD THING TO.

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:36.575 region:rollup2
THOUGH THERE STUDENTS HAVE TAKEN

00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:38.143 region:rollup2
THE LEAD IN TAKING THE CHARGE.

00:24:36.575 --> 00:24:39.011 region:rollup2
IF ONE OF THE IDEAS OF CAMPUS

00:24:38.143 --> 00:24:40.346 region:rollup2
CLIMATE IS TO PROVIDE AN

00:24:39.011 --> 00:24:42.548 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THAT PROMOTES AND

00:24:40.346 --> 00:24:43.849 region:rollup2
SUSTAINS ACADEMIC SUCCESS.

00:24:42.548 --> 00:24:45.951 region:rollup2
THEN IMPROVING INSTITUTIONAL

00:24:43.849 --> 00:24:46.518 region:rollup2
RESPONSES TO THESE ISSUES THAT

00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:47.853 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY A

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:48.887 region:rollup2
RELEVANT.

00:24:47.853 --> 00:24:50.189 region:rollup2
OUR PREFERENCE MOST OF OUR

00:24:48.887 --> 00:24:52.124 region:rollup2
CAMPUS CLIMATE MEETINGS ESTATE

00:24:50.189 --> 00:24:53.859 region:rollup2
AGAIN FOR THIS ONE THIS IS NOT A

00:24:52.124 --> 00:24:56.028 region:rollup2
HEARING DESIGNATED TO LAMB BASS

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:57.763 region:rollup2

TO FIND OUT WHAT'S WORKING

00:24:59.465 --> 00:25:02.034 region:rollup2
WHAT'S NOT AND HOW WE CAN

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:03.836 region:rollup2
IMPROVE IT. WE BELIEVE THAT MANY

00:25:02.034 --> 00:25:05.838 region:rollup2

00:25:03.836 --> 00:25:07.106 region:rollup2

TWO YEARS TO GET THERE.

FROM LITTLE.

00:40:34.699 --> 00:40:37.969 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WORKING AROUND

00:40:36.134 --> 00:40:40.872 region:rollup2
CAMPUS TO GET STUFF DONE TO

00:40:37.969 --> 00:40:41.372 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO MAKE A

00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:42.640 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM.

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:44.142 region:rollup2
MY DREAM IS THAT EVERY STUDENT

00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:46.411 region:rollup2
ENROLLED IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:40:44.142 --> 00:40:48.146 region:rollup2
HAS ACCESS TO AT LEAST ONE HOT

MEAL EVERY DAY.

00:40:48.146 --> 00:40:52.550 region:rollup2
AND AS THEY SAY THAT IS PRETTY

00:40:50.748 --> 00:40:54.018 region:rollup2
LOW HANGING FRUIT.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:55.420 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THE CURRENT FUNDING OUR

00:40:54.018 --> 00:40:57.889 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE LEFT TO HOPE THAT A

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:59.557 region:rollup2
FEW COMMITTED INDIVIDUALS TAKE

00:40:57.889 --> 00:41:01.626 region:rollup2
UP THIS WORK AND CARRYING ON.

00:40:59.557 --> 00:41:03.294 region:rollup2
THAT CARRIED ON UNSUPPORTED AND

00:41:01.626 --> 00:41:05.330 region:rollup2
UNCOMPENSATED WITHOUT THESE

00:41:03.294 --> 00:41:06.631 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:07.966 region:rollup2
A SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION TO A

00:41:06.631 --> 00:41:09.667 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE NOW KNOW IS SO

00:41:07.966 --> 00:41:10.601 region:rollup2
BIG.

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.636 region:rollup2

THAT'S BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW WE

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:22.013 region:rollup2

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:59.684 region:rollup2
AND SECURITY THAT IMPACT THE

00:41:58.049 --> 00:42:00.718 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS.

00:41:59.684 --> 00:42:01.819 region:rollup2
AND USE THE PHRASE A NUMBER

00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:03.388 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AT THIS MOMENT AS

00:42:01.819 --> 00:42:04.288 region:rollup2
COLLEEN MENTIONS WE DO NOT KNOW

00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:05.456 region:rollup2
HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE AFFECTED

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:06.958 region:rollup2
BY THESE ISSUES. BUT WE KNOW

00:42:05.456 --> 00:42:08.693 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THERE.

00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:09.727 region:rollup2
EATING IN OUR CLASSROOMS SITTING

00:42:08.693 --> 00:42:10.628 region:rollup2
IN OUR LIBRARIES AND EVEN

00:42:09.727 --> 00:42:12.697 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES SLEEPING IN OUR OWN

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:13.331 region:rollup2
PARKING LOTS.

00:42:12.697 --> 00:42:14.899 region:rollup2
I THINK WE SAW UNDERSTAND THE

00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:16.367 region:rollup2
SENSE HILDA COMES ALONG WITH

00:42:14.899 --> 00:42:17.502 region:rollup2
TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.636 region:rollup2
EVEN AFTER EXPLAINING THAT

00:42:17.502 --> 00:42:19.737 region:rollup2
SLEEPING ON A DIFFERENT COLLEGE

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.905 region:rollup2
EVERY WEEK OR NOT HAVING ENOUGH

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:22.440 region:rollup2
MONEY T. BREAKFAST WHERE THEY

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:24.042 region:rollup2
CAN BE A.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.510 region:rollup2
A DEGREE OF INSECURITY SOME

00:42:24.042 --> 00:42:27.078 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO DENY

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:28.279 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SIGMA ASSOCIATED WE

00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:29.814 region:rollup2
HEAR THE WORDS HOMELESS OR EVEN

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:30.681 region:rollup2
IN SECURE.

00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:32.150 region:rollup2
AND KNOW CITY WANTS TO BE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:35.787 region:rollup2
STATISTICALLY TO BE CATEGORIZED

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:36.988 region:rollup2
AS SOMEONE WHO NEEDS EXTRA HELP.

00:42:35.787 --> 00:42:38.389 region:rollup2
SO THE QUICK ACTIVITY I HAD

00:42:36.988 --> 00:42:39.390 region:rollup2
THOUGHT I HAD A LITTLE MORE TIME

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.858 region:rollup2
BUT I WANT US ALL TO HEAR TO

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:42.260 region:rollup2
IMAGINE FOR A SECOND THAT WOULD

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:43.995 region:rollup2
HOMELESS ARE FOOD INSECURE

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.563 region:rollup2
STUDENT LOOKS LIKE.

00:42:43.995 --> 00:42:46.197 region:rollup2
HOW DOES YOUR HAIR LOOK LIKE?

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:47.999 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF CLOTHES ARE THEY

00:42:46.197 --> 00:42:49.167 region:rollup2
WEARING BUT THEY CAN'T ANY ITEMS

00:42:47.999 --> 00:42:50.535 region:rollup2
WITH THEM?

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:51.702 region:rollup2
LOOK AROUND THE ROOM DO WE THINK

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:53.104 region:rollup2
ANYONE HERE TODAY FACE SOME OF

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:55.139 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES.

00:42:53.104 --> 00:42:56.073 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THAT THE STUDENTS

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.875 region:rollup2
CAN LOOK LIKE ANYONE OF US HERE

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:59.243 region:rollup2
TODAY AND TO PROBABLY ADDRESSES

00:42:57.875 --> 00:43:00.311 region:rollup2
ISSUES WE HAVE TO GET RID OF ANY

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:02.880 region:rollup2
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS WE HAVE

00:43:00.311 --> 00:43:03.915 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE POPULATIONS.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.183 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO

00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:06.584 region:rollup2
IMAGINE THAT ALTHOUGH CD MAYBE

00:43:05.183 --> 00:43:08.352 region:rollup2
WORKING IT'S STILL POSSIBLE FOR

00:43:06.584 --> 00:43:09.620 region:rollup2
THEM TO FACE SOME DEGREE OF FOOD

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:10.721 region:rollup2
AND HOUSING AND SECURITY. WE

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:12.023 region:rollup2
TELL STUDENTS THAT THEY MUST

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.324 region:rollup2
WORK TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE HOURS

00:43:12.023 --> 00:43:15.093 region:rollup2
A WEEK TO MEET THE FINANCIAL

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:16.794 region:rollup2
BURDEN OF ATTENDING COLLEGE WE

00:43:15.093 --> 00:43:17.428 region:rollup2
HAVE TO IMAGINE THE WORK

00:43:16.794 --> 00:43:18.029 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS OF THE STUDENTS ARE

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:19.230 region:rollup2
ENTERING.

00:43:18.029 --> 00:43:20.765 region:rollup2
MOST STUDENTS HAVE INTERACTED

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:22.433 region:rollup2
WITH LIKE MYSELF WORK PART TIME

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:23.768 region:rollup2
JOBS AT RETAIL LOCATIONS MOVIE

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:25.570 region:rollup2
THEATERS ARE IN SOME FORM OF

00:43:23.768 --> 00:43:26.504 region:rollup2
FAST FOOD SERVICE. YOU KNOW JUST

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.705 region:rollup2
THIS MONTH A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE

00:43:26.504 --> 00:43:29.574 region:rollup2
TO STRUGGLING TO FIND AN EXTRA

00:43:27.705 --> 00:43:30.908 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF INCOME.

00:43:29.574 --> 00:43:32.076 region:rollup2
BUT TO HELP PAY FOR RENT BECAUSE

00:43:30.908 --> 00:43:33.911 region:rollup2
HOURS WERE CUT THE TEN HOURS A

00:43:32.076 --> 00:43:35.346 region:rollup2
WEEK SIMPLY DUE TO SOMETHING OUT

00:43:33.911 --> 00:43:36.948 region:rollup2
OF HIS CONTROL LIKE LET SHOPPERS

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:38.216 region:rollup2
IN A PARKING.

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:39.283 region:rollup2
SO ANY LEVEL FOOD HOUSING OF

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.685 region:rollup2
SECURITY CAN BE A DETERMINING

00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:42.453 region:rollup2
FACTOR WHETHER SOMEONE DECIDES

00:43:40.685 --> 00:43:44.388 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION AND

00:43:42.453 --> 00:43:44.922 region:rollup2
EVEN I AS YES PASSED AS THEY

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:46.624 region:rollup2
HAVE ABOUT THE PURSUIT OF

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:48.826 region:rollup2
LEARNING. WOULD NOT HESITATE TO

00:43:46.624 --> 00:43:51.295 region:rollup2
CHOOSES THE SURVIVAL MYSELF MY

00:43:48.826 --> 00:43:53.364 region:rollup2
FAMILY OVER MY PROCEED EDUCATION

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:53.965 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE NOT DECISIONS THAT

00:43:53.364 --> 00:43:55.032 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE

00:43:53.965 --> 00:43:56.000 region:rollup2
TO MAKING.

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:57.301 region:rollup2
AS AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE DONE

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.870 region:rollup2
OUR BEST TO HELP EASE THE CITY

00:43:57.301 --> 00:44:00.004 region:rollup2
LIFE EXPERIENCE. IN JUST TWO

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:01.539 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO THERE WAS AN ASSEMBLY

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:02.673 region:rollup2

PERSONAL STORIES.

00:44:10.348 --> 00:44:13.151 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID

00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:14.318 region:rollup2
NOT COMMEND THOSE COLLEGES. WHO

00:44:13.151 --> 00:44:15.653 region:rollup2

THESE ISSUES LIKE CREATING FOOD

00:44:28.332 --> 00:44:30.968 region:rollup2
PANTRIES AS MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:32.470 region:rollup2
ALLOWING THE DISBURSEMENT OF

SIMILAR STORIES ARE SHARED ABOUT

00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:49.020 region:rollup2
HOW STUDENTS FACE THEN EMERGENCY

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:51.088 region:rollup2
WAS ABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL

HERE THAT THE SERVICES WE

PROVIDE TO STUDENTS ARE LIMITED

00:44:58.362 --> 00:45:00.097 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY AT COMMUNITY

00:44:58.863 --> 00:45:01.232 region:rollup2
COLLEGES.

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.233 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE WAYS

00:45:01.232 --> 00:45:03.534 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ARE DRESSING THESE

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:04.869 region:rollup2
ISSUES IS A PARTING WITH

ACCESS OUTSIDE OF THEIR SPECIFIC

00:45:07.672 --> 00:45:10.074 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS.

00:45:14.645 --> 00:45:18.015 region:rollup2
FACILITIES AND SOMETIMES EVEN

00:45:16.213 --> 00:45:18.549 region:rollup2
WITH SELF WITH THE STUDENTS CAN

00:45:18.015 --> 00:45:19.650 region:rollup2
HAVE OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:20.585 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.786 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T EVEN OUT OF THE SYSTEM

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:23.220 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS

00:45:21.786 --> 00:45:24.622 region:rollup2
AS KALI MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAD

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.390 region:rollup2
OUR FIRST EVER BASIC NEEDS

00:45:24.622 --> 00:45:27.825 region:rollup2
SUMMIT JUST HERE LAST WEEK. AND

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:29.961 region:rollup2
WERE EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THAT

00:45:27.825 --> 00:45:30.428 region:rollup2
GOES ON MOVING FORWARD.

00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:31.762 region:rollup2
BUT THERE IS ROOM FOR

00:45:30.428 --> 00:45:33.297 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT.

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:34.599 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JUST DUE TO THE RECENCY

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:36.367 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS.

00:45:34.599 --> 00:45:38.135 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS WE'VE

00:45:36.367 --> 00:45:39.637 region:rollup2
SEEN OUR SOMETIMES REACTIONARY.

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:40.771 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SOME THESE INSTITUTIONS

00:45:39.637 --> 00:45:42.340 region:rollup2
HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:43.574 region:rollup2
RESOURCES LIKE TWO HUNDRED MEAL

00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:45.610 region:rollup2
VOUCHERS AVAILABLE TO THEIR

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:46.143 region:rollup2
ENTIRE STUDENT POPULATION OF

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.446 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES TWENTY TO THIRTY

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:49.313 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:50.514 region:rollup2
AND SOMETIMES SOME COLLEGES HAVE

00:45:49.313 --> 00:45:52.083 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:53.884 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HALF OF YOUR EFFORTS BY

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:55.453 region:rollup2
FACULTY MEMBER STAFF MEMBER

00:45:53.884 --> 00:45:56.587 region:rollup2
STEVEN ACCESS THE SERVICES. AND

00:45:55.453 --> 00:45:57.788 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH WELL INTENTIONED THESE

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.890 region:rollup2
ARE NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF

00:45:57.788 --> 00:46:01.258 region:rollup2
OUR STUDENTS WHO. ONE DON'T SELF

00:45:59.890 --> 00:46:02.927 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY OR TWO DON'T EVEN KNOW

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:04.061 region:rollup2
THE FACE THESE INSECURITIES FOR

00:46:02.927 --> 00:46:05.663 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:06.764 region:rollup2
AND I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO

00:46:05.663 --> 00:46:08.065 region:rollup2
IMAGINE HOW HEARTBREAKING I MUST

00:46:06.764 --> 00:46:09.267 region:rollup2
BE FOR FACULTY OR STAFF MEMBERS

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.668 region:rollup2
HAVE TO TURN AWAY STUDENT SIMPLY

00:46:09.267 --> 00:46:12.403 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SERVICE IS NO LONGER

00:46:10.668 --> 00:46:13.571 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE.

00:46:12.403 --> 00:46:14.872 region:rollup2
WE COULD BE MORE PRODUCTIVE IN

00:46:13.571 --> 00:46:16.807 region:rollup2
OUR APPROACH IF WE KNEW BUT MORE

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:19.210 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS.

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:20.711 region:rollup2
I TALK ABOUT THIS SOME EARLIER

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.013 region:rollup2
WHERE IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:23.848 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE UNDERSTAND OUT IN.

00:46:22.013 --> 00:46:24.882 region:rollup2
THAT STUDENTS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE

00:46:23.848 --> 00:46:26.450 region:rollup2
FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:28.219 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WE UNDERSTAND THERE IS A

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:29.687 region:rollup2
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO

00:46:28.219 --> 00:46:30.488 region:rollup2
PROVIDE FOR THAT STUDENT. AND

00:46:29.687 --> 00:46:31.856 region:rollup2
WOULD A STUDENT LEAVES THAT

STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE.

00:46:41.399 --> 00:46:44.368 region:rollup2
LOCALLY WE MUST ALSO COMMUNICATE

WE CAN AT LEAST PREPARE FOR

00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:53.944 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. WE COULD BE

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:56.213 region:rollup2

WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT SOME

00:47:10.428 --> 00:47:13.097 region:rollup2
STUDENTS CANNOT REALIZE A DREAM

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:14.065 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE

00:47:13.097 --> 00:47:15.800 region:rollup2

SERIOUS ISSUES OF BOTH HOME AND

00:48:17.428 --> 00:48:20.931 region:rollup2
FOOD INSECURITY. AND THEY ARE TO

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.233 region:rollup2

INNOVATIVE.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:31.475 region:rollup2
BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU OF THE

00:48:28.873 --> 00:48:33.244 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS WHAT.

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:34.545 region:rollup2
CAN THE STATE DO.

00:48:33.244 --> 00:48:36.981 region:rollup2
AND THE WHAT WHAT WHAT

00:48:34.545 --> 00:48:38.516 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS DO YOU HAVE TO US.

00:48:36.981 --> 00:48:38.716 region:rollup2
AS STATE LEGISLATORS

00:48:38.516 --> 00:48:40.751 region:rollup2
TO TO.

00:48:38.716 --> 00:48:42.119 region:rollup2
.

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:45.122 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO FACE.

00:48:42.119 --> 00:48:47.758 region:rollup2
THEY HISH ISSUE HEAD ON INTO.

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:50.161 region:rollup2
HOW? THE THREE SYSTEMS WITH THE

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:52.463 region:rollup2
WITH WITH THE ISSUE BECAUSE I I

00:48:50.161 --> 00:48:54.532 region:rollup2
THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME. THAT

00:48:52.463 --> 00:48:55.432 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOLS OF KIND OF BEEN THE

00:48:54.532 --> 00:48:56.967 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IN THE STUDENTS HAVE

00:48:55.432 --> 00:48:58.669 region:rollup2
BEEN. KIND OF.

00:48:56.967 --> 00:49:00.538 region:rollup2
LEFT ALONE TO FEND FOR

00:48:58.669 --> 00:49:02.640 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES.

00:49:00.538 --> 00:49:05.009 region:rollup2
SO MY QUESTION TO THE THREE OF

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.611 region:rollup2
YOU IS WHAT. SUGGESTIONS DO YOU

00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:08.813 region:rollup2
HAVE FOR US.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:09.547 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE BETTER HELP THE

00:49:08.813 --> 00:49:11.048 region:rollup2
STUDENTS?

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:12.783 region:rollup2
?

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:13.884 region:rollup2
WITH THE ISSUES

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:16.320 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE FIRST THING THAT

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:18.055 region:rollup2
COMES TO MIND IS IS ANY EFFORTS

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.156 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DONE TO STREAMLINE

00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:20.758 region:rollup2
THE CAL FRESH APPLICATION

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:22.126 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

00:49:20.758 --> 00:49:23.761 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:27.164 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING.

00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:28.699 region:rollup2
COUNTY ACCOUNT FOR STAFF TO YOU

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:30.201 region:rollup2
KNOW PARTICIPATE AS ROBUSTLY AND

00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:31.969 region:rollup2
THEY ARE PARTICIPATING QUITE

00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:33.704 region:rollup2
ROBUSTLY IN IN PARTICULAR PLACES

00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE BUT. I THINK ANY

00:49:33.704 --> 00:49:36.974 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGEMENT OR ANY LEGISLATION

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:38.342 region:rollup2
THAT THAT SORT OF PUSHES TOWARD

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:40.778 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:43.247 region:rollup2
I'D DO STILL THINK THAT WE HAVE

00:49:40.778 --> 00:49:45.583 region:rollup2
SOME ISSUES AROUND.

00:49:43.247 --> 00:49:47.551 region:rollup2
COLLEGES ACCESSING LOCAL FOOD

00:49:45.583 --> 00:49:49.420 region:rollup2
BANK RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THIS

00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:50.654 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT ISSUE AND I THINK WE

00:49:49.420 --> 00:49:52.389 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMEONE IN THE ROOM WHO.

00:49:50.654 --> 00:49:53.958 region:rollup2
RACHEL FROM SWIPE WHO'S OFFERED

00:49:52.389 --> 00:49:54.892 region:rollup2
TO HELP US

00:49:53.958 --> 00:49:57.261 region:rollup2
TRIED TO GET SOME RESOLUTION ON

00:49:54.892 --> 00:49:58.262 region:rollup2
THAT BUT YOU CAN TAKE UP TO TWO

00:49:57.261 --> 00:49:59.697 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS TO GET THOSE

00:49:58.262 --> 00:50:01.632 region:rollup2
AGREEMENTS IN PLACE IN SOME

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:03.000 region:rollup2
PLACES. BECAUSE OF THAT

00:50:01.632 --> 00:50:05.135 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT ISSUE.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:07.137 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:50:05.135 --> 00:50:09.340 region:rollup2
FOR US TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:10.374 region:rollup2
CRISIS AND TO TRY TO DELVE INTO

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.409 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE I THINK

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:13.811 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY. THAT'S WHERE

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:15.246 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE FALLING THROUGH THE

00:50:13.811 --> 00:50:16.680 region:rollup2
CRACKS BECAUSE IT'S JUST SO

00:50:15.246 --> 00:50:18.883 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE TO LIVE IN

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.918 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. OF THE FOR NON STOOD

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:21.452 region:rollup2
FOR AND ALL OF US RIGHT AND SO

00:50:20.918 --> 00:50:22.453 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:50:21.452 --> 00:50:24.488 region:rollup2
STUDENTS.

00:50:22.453 --> 00:50:25.890 region:rollup2
BUNKING UP EIGHT IN A IN A ONE

00:50:24.488 --> 00:50:27.057 region:rollup2
OR TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT I THINK

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:29.493 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AROUND

00:50:27.057 --> 00:50:32.263 region:rollup2
HOUSING IS WOULD BE VERY VERY

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:33.364 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO THE STUDENTS.

00:50:32.263 --> 00:50:35.099 region:rollup2
THE MOST OF OUR COMMUNITY

00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:36.600 region:rollup2
COLLEGES DON'T HAVE HOUSING YEAH

00:50:35.099 --> 00:50:39.169 region:rollup2
ELEVEN OF THE HUNDRED AND

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:40.504 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN HAVE LIMITED.

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:44.975 region:rollup2
DORMITORY OR OR CAMPUS BASED

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:46.110 region:rollup2
HOUSING.

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:48.312 region:rollup2
ANYONE ELSE YEAH.

00:50:46.110 --> 00:50:49.980 region:rollup2
AT THE SUMMIT THE BASIC NEED

00:50:48.312 --> 00:50:51.015 region:rollup2
SOME OF THAT WE ALL ATTENDED

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.350 region:rollup2
LAST WEEK.

00:50:51.015 --> 00:50:54.285 region:rollup2
SOMEONE DISCUSS THE IDEA THAT

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.152 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE CASE

00:50:54.285 --> 00:50:57.421 region:rollup2
THROUGH TWELVE.

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:59.123 region:rollup2
FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH OR FREE

00:50:57.421 --> 00:51:00.357 region:rollup2
BREAKFAST PROGRAMS AND AT THE

00:50:59.123 --> 00:51:01.458 region:rollup2
MOMENT THEY TURN EIGHTEEN AND

00:51:00.357 --> 00:51:03.160 region:rollup2
MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:05.129 region:rollup2
THEY'RE CUT OFF FROM THAT. AND

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.530 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T A CONVERSATION

00:51:05.129 --> 00:51:08.165 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.900 region:rollup2
TWO ONE HELP US IDENTIFY WHO

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:11.535 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE HIGH RISK.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.337 region:rollup2
AND HAVING SOME WAY IN WHICH

00:51:11.535 --> 00:51:14.738 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN WOULD KNOW WHO THOSE

00:51:13.337 --> 00:51:15.706 region:rollup2
STUDENTS ARE BECAUSE LIKE YOU

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.207 region:rollup2
KNOW BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:18.275 region:rollup2
STIGMA AROUND IT AND. AND THEIR

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:19.510 region:rollup2
NEW TO COLLEGE IN THE DON'T KNOW

00:51:18.275 --> 00:51:20.978 region:rollup2
HOW THE SYSTEMS WORKS AND THEY

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.646 region:rollup2
HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:23.881 region:rollup2
RESOURCES ANYWAY.

00:51:22.646 --> 00:51:25.482 region:rollup2
JUST BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE

00:51:23.881 --> 00:51:27.518 region:rollup2
AMONG THE SYSTEMS IT WOULD BE

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:29.253 region:rollup2
HELPFUL AND. EXTENDING SOME OF

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:31.055 region:rollup2
THOSE PROGRAMS INTO THE

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:31.555 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AYE I THINK

00:51:31.055 --> 00:51:33.657 region:rollup2
WOULD BE AN AMAZING STEP

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.025 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:36.493 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY WOULD ADDRESS THE

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:38.262 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF HAVING THEM AT LEAST BE

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:40.297 region:rollup2

INSTITUTIONS ITSELF.

00:53:29.707 --> 00:53:33.177 region:rollup2
SO HOUSING CRISIS IS A HUGE ONE

00:53:31.742 --> 00:53:34.812 region:rollup2
THAT IMPACTS LOT OF STUDENTS.

STUDENTS BESIDES TELLING HIM TO

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.155 region:rollup2
GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

00:53:44.188 --> 00:53:47.124 region:rollup2
AND THEN EXPANDING YOU KNOW CAL

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:48.759 region:rollup2
FRESH AYE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT

00:53:47.124 --> 00:53:50.060 region:rollup2
EXPANDING YOU KNOW ANYTHING TO

00:53:48.759 --> 00:53:52.362 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO BOTH APPLY

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:53.831 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS TO. TO RECOMMEND

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:55.199 region:rollup2
THOSE APPLICATIONS CAN DO A LOT.

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:56.900 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S THERE'S LESS OF A

00:53:55.199 --> 00:53:59.703 region:rollup2
CIGAR AROUND YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:01.105 region:rollup2
IDEA OF OF CAL FRESH RAIN IN THE

00:53:59.703 --> 00:54:02.673 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS THAT I'VE SEEN.

00:54:01.105 --> 00:54:04.274 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS ARE MORE COURAGE NOW

00:54:02.673 --> 00:54:05.676 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY MY COLLEGE TO APPLY

00:54:04.274 --> 00:54:07.478 region:rollup2
AND TO UTILIZE THOSE SERVICES

00:54:05.676 --> 00:54:08.512 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HUGE STEP FORWARD WHO

00:54:07.478 --> 00:54:11.181 region:rollup2
CAN DEFTLY TAKE SOME MORE STEPS

00:54:08.512 --> 00:54:15.285 region:rollup2
TO. IMPROVE IN THAT ACCESS TO A

00:54:11.181 --> 00:54:16.620 region:rollup2
LOT OF OUR STUDENTS.

00:54:15.285 --> 00:54:18.589 region:rollup2
DOUBLE DUTCH IS NOT SHARED WITH

00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:19.790 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONS ARE OUR SYSTEMS

00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:21.158 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME STUDENTS WHO ARE

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:23.327 region:rollup2
ALREADY HIGH RISK INDICATORS

00:54:21.158 --> 00:54:24.528 region:rollup2
TELL SYSTEM. SO WE HAD AWAY AS A

00:54:23.327 --> 00:54:26.230 region:rollup2
CALLING MENTION TO IDENTIFY

00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:27.264 region:rollup2
THOSE STUDENTS A LITTLE EARLIER

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.899 region:rollup2
AND FIND THOSE POTENTIAL HIGH

00:54:27.264 --> 00:54:29.867 region:rollup2
RISK STUDENTS WE CAN ADJUST THEM

00:54:28.899 --> 00:54:30.667 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY.

00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:32.469 region:rollup2
AS ONE OF THE ISSUES WE HAVE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:34.104 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS IS COMMUNICATING TO

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:36.974 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW IS

CASTING A WIDE NET BECAUSE WE DO

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.877 region:rollup2
NOT KNOW WHO THE STUDENTS ARE.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:41.645 region:rollup2
WITH LIMITED RESOURCES WE CAN

00:54:39.877 --> 00:54:44.248 region:rollup2
ONLY DO SO MUCH TALKING US THIS

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:44.815 region:rollup2

ALBEIT.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.916 region:rollup2
I WOULD NEED ANYTHING ELSE

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.251 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:09.686 region:rollup2

SHE DID THIS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALSO

01:03:09.686 --> 01:03:12.689 region:rollup2
BUT BACK THEN SHE HAD QUALIFIED

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.757 region:rollup2
FOR FREE LUNCH THESE ISSUES

01:03:12.689 --> 01:03:15.025 region:rollup2

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:25.802 region:rollup2
MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT OUR

01:03:19.095 --> 01:03:27.437 region:rollup2

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:29.039 region:rollup2
IN THE STUDY ALSO FOUND THAT

01:04:16.553 --> 01:04:20.690 region:rollup2
AMONG OTHER THINGS.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:22.459 region:rollup2
FOR THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:24.027 region:rollup2
INDICATORS WE FOUND THE MORE

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:25.895 region:rollup2
FOOD INSECURE AND THE MORE. A

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.830 region:rollup2
STUDENT WAS HOMELESS THE MORE

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.997 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS OF POOR MENTAL AND

01:04:26.830 --> 01:04:30.367 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL HEALTH EXPRIENCE THE

01:04:27.997 --> 01:04:32.135 region:rollup2
LAST THIRTY DAYS. AND THE MORE

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:33.636 region:rollup2
DAYS MISSED OF SCHOOL OR WORK.

01:04:32.135 --> 01:04:35.271 region:rollup2
STUDENTS MISS NEARLY DOUBLE

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:36.940 region:rollup2
DOUBLE OR NEARLY DOUBLE THE DAYS

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:40.110 region:rollup2
WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR PEERS

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:41.378 region:rollup2
WHOSE BASIC NEEDS ARE BEING MET.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:42.712 region:rollup2
WE HEARD A LOT OF PUSH BACK

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.947 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW STUDENTS FACE FOOD

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.014 region:rollup2
INSECURITY IN HOMELESSNESS

01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:46.850 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FINANCIALLY

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:48.451 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE SO WE ASK STUDENTS

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:49.853 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHY THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.221 region:rollup2
BUY GROCERIES. WE ASKED ABOUT

01:04:49.853 --> 01:04:53.256 region:rollup2
SPENDING HABITS SUCH AS BUYING

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.157 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL EATING OUT GOING OUT

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:56.126 region:rollup2
WITH FRIENDS AS WELL AS

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:57.727 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT BUDGETING AND

01:04:56.126 --> 01:04:58.928 region:rollup2
CONFUSION WITH PAYING BILLS.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:00.029 region:rollup2
I KNOW SOME STUDENTS DID

01:04:58.928 --> 01:05:01.664 region:rollup2
STRUGGLE WITH BUDGETING ISSUES

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.966 region:rollup2
NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:04.267 region:rollup2
OVERWHELMINGLY WE FOUND THAT

01:05:02.966 --> 01:05:05.969 region:rollup2
MOST STUDENTS OVER SEVENTY

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:07.604 region:rollup2
PERCENT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH

01:05:05.969 --> 01:05:08.271 region:rollup2
MONEY TO BUY GROCERIES BECAUSE

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.973 region:rollup2
THEY SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:11.274 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND THIS MAKES SENSE

01:05:09.973 --> 01:05:12.609 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ON AVERAGE WE KNOW THAT

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:14.043 region:rollup2
A PUBLIC FOUR YEAR DEGREE COST

01:05:12.609 --> 01:05:15.779 region:rollup2
TWELVE THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS PER

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:16.780 region:rollup2
YEAR. IN WHAT IS PROVIDED IN A

01:05:15.779 --> 01:05:18.681 region:rollup2
FULL FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:19.849 region:rollup2
INCLUDING LOANS.

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:20.750 region:rollup2
WHEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MONEY

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:30.493 region:rollup2
OFTEN BASIC NEEDS ARE THE FIRST

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:32.529 region:rollup2
TO GO.

01:05:30.493 --> 01:05:34.330 region:rollup2
SO CAL FRESHMAN CAMPUS EMERGENCY

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:35.799 region:rollup2
FOR FOOD PANTRY INCREASE FOOD

01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.434 region:rollup2
PANTRY USE INCREASE WHEN

01:05:35.799 --> 01:05:39.068 region:rollup2
STUDENTS REPORTED LOAN VERY LOW.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:40.837 region:rollup2
FOOD INSECURITY HOWEVER

01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:41.337 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION IS WERE STILL VERY

01:05:40.837 --> 01:05:43.373 region:rollup2
LOW AT THE TIME A DATA

01:05:41.337 --> 01:05:44.307 region:rollup2
COLLECTION. AND WE EVEN THOUGH

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:45.708 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT HOW FRESH THE

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:47.877 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS SUPPORT WHICH IS

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:49.212 region:rollup2
CLEAR IN THE DATA AND ALSO IN

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:49.946 region:rollup2
THE WORDS OF STUDENT FIONA WHO

01:05:49.212 --> 01:05:51.681 region:rollup2
SHARED HOW MUCH IT REALLY

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:52.949 region:rollup2
MATTERS. SHE SAID I DON'T

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:54.117 region:rollup2
REMEMBER HOW MUCH I GOT THIS

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.685 region:rollup2
MONTH BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:57.220 region:rollup2
SEMESTER IN COLLEGE OF EVER MADE

01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:59.255 region:rollup2

HEALTHY FOOD AND I THINK ABOUT

01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:02.425 region:rollup2
MONEY PROBLEMS OBVIOUSLY

01:06:01.291 --> 01:06:03.159 region:rollup2
CONSUMES YOU.

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.762 region:rollup2
IF I WAS GETTING ENOUGH

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:07.297 region:rollup2
NUTRITION I WAS GETTING ENERGY I

01:06:05.762 --> 01:06:08.031 region:rollup2
WAS AWAKEN EATEN BREAKFAST EVERY

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:12.268 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.536 region:rollup2
SO RESPONDING TO STUDENTS WHO

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:15.205 region:rollup2
ARE HOUSING IN FOOD INSECURE

01:06:13.536 --> 01:06:16.773 region:rollup2

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:26.115 region:rollup2
NOW I'M GOING TO SWITCH GEARS

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:27.116 region:rollup2

IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:35.758 region:rollup2
WE STARTED WITH THE GOAL OF

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:37.293 region:rollup2

HOWEVER MANY STUDENTS SHOWED UP

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.570 region:rollup2

AND ALTHOUGH THESE INCIDENTS ARE

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:57.894 region:rollup2

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:32.428 region:rollup2
THE CSU SYSTEM LEADS THE NATION

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:34.263 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS OF WHAT ALL

STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD BE PROUD.

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.632 region:rollup2

FACING RACISM PREJUDICE AND

OF COURSE THERE ARE OTHER

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:06.449 region:rollup2
FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:07.850 region:rollup2

FRIENDS ARMY ANTIC PARTNERS.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.592 region:rollup2
THESE FACTORS ARE ALL LINKED AND

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:17.827 region:rollup2
LAYERED.

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:19.061 region:rollup2
STUDENTS HAVE WORKED HARD FOR

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:20.363 region:rollup2
THE PAST FEW YEARS TO TRY TO

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:21.731 region:rollup2
EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:22.665 region:rollup2
ON OUR CAMPUSES BUT

01:13:21.731 --> 01:13:24.300 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE NOT BEEN

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:25.234 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH.

01:13:24.300 --> 01:13:26.302 region:rollup2

THAT RANGE.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.782 region:rollup2
AND AT SOME CAMPUSES THERE YOU

01:13:38.180 --> 01:13:41.550 region:rollup2
SEE THE RATIO IS MUCH HIGHER. AT

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:43.319 region:rollup2

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:50.559 region:rollup2
THESE RATIOS MEAN ON MANY

ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:04.774 region:rollup2

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:06.442 region:rollup2
LONG AND HAVE SUCH A LACK OF

01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:17.787 region:rollup2
THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO

EXPAND THESE RESOURCES ON CAMPUS

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:20.222 region:rollup2

01:14:20.222 --> 01:14:22.525 region:rollup2

THAT CONTINUE TO RISE.

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:32.768 region:rollup2
IF THE ONLY SOLUTION WITH

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.570 region:rollup2
RESPECT MENTAL HEALTH IS TO

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.671 region:rollup2
EXACERBATE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:37.340 region:rollup2

HAVE TO SLEEP IN YOUR CAR AND

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:15.838 region:rollup2

RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH I THINK

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:25.648 region:rollup2
ARE VERY IMPORTANT AS WE. AS WE

01:16:23.646 --> 01:16:27.416 region:rollup2
DO IT APPEARED KIND OF A COSTLY

01:16:25.648 --> 01:16:29.418 region:rollup2
FINDING OURSELVES GOING THROUGH

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:31.620 region:rollup2
THE VARIOUS BE AREAS THAT EXIST

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:33.189 region:rollup2
OF THE THAT WE CAN LEGISLATIVELY

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:34.523 region:rollup2
REMOVED. IN ORDER TO MAKE IT

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.092 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR THE CAMPUSES TO

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:38.194 region:rollup2
WRESTLE WITH THE ISSUES.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.195 region:rollup2
WE DID DO SOME FUNDING LAST

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.896 region:rollup2
YEAR I'M NOT SURE IF WE'LL BE

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:42.832 region:rollup2
DOING I HOPE WILL BE DOING SOME

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.333 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR AGAIN. AS AN INCENTIVE

01:16:42.832 --> 01:16:46.769 region:rollup2
TO THE CAMPUSES TO DEAL WITH THE

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:47.703 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF OF FOOD INSECURITY AND

01:16:46.769 --> 01:16:50.005 region:rollup2
AND HOMELESSNESS.

01:16:47.703 --> 01:16:53.109 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE WE

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:53.876 region:rollup2
WE DELIVERED UP HERE OF COURSE

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:54.543 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:16:53.876 --> 01:16:55.911 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ISSUES OF HOUSING IN THE

01:16:54.543 --> 01:16:58.080 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE COST

01:16:55.911 --> 01:16:59.882 region:rollup2
OF HOUSING AND SO FORTH AND SO

01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.916 region:rollup2
ON SO IT'S A MAJOR ISSUE IN AND.

01:16:59.882 --> 01:17:03.085 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:04.520 region:rollup2
STUDENTS BECAUSE WE THINK OF

01:17:03.085 --> 01:17:06.388 region:rollup2
THEY ALL LIVE IN THE DORM WHICH

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:07.590 region:rollup2
IS NOT TRUE AND SO AS A RESULT

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:09.992 region:rollup2
THAT MAKES IT THAT WE HAVE TO

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:11.127 region:rollup2
BREAK DOWN THAT. THAT THAT CYCLE

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:12.995 region:rollup2
OF THINKING ESPECIALLY IN OUR

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:14.563 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DON'T HAVE

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:16.365 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO DORMITORIES THAT'LL

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:17.933 region:rollup2
SOME OF YOUR CAMPUSES HAVE.

01:17:16.365 --> 01:17:19.135 region:rollup2
.

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:20.769 region:rollup2
THE C. ISSUE I HAVE HAVE SET

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:22.271 region:rollup2
ASIDE ROOMS IN THE DORM TO DEAL

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:23.939 region:rollup2
WITH THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:26.275 region:rollup2
ON A TEMPORARY BASIS SO YOU HAVE

01:17:23.939 --> 01:17:27.309 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ACCESS TO THAT ISSUE

01:17:26.275 --> 01:17:29.078 region:rollup2
THAT SEVERE.

01:17:27.309 --> 01:17:29.745 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TO DO

01:17:29.078 --> 01:17:32.014 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:33.649 region:rollup2
OF SOMETIMES I SEE ISSUE IN

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:34.783 region:rollup2
UC'S HAVE A FEW MORE RESOURCES

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.885 region:rollup2
THAT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE OF

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:37.553 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE OF

01:17:35.885 --> 01:17:39.255 region:rollup2
THOSE CAMPUSES. AND THE

01:17:37.553 --> 01:17:40.890 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT THE

01:17:39.255 --> 01:17:42.291 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR COLLEGE VERSUS THE TWO

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.692 region:rollup2
YEAR COLLEGE WITH REGARDS TO

01:17:42.291 --> 01:17:44.927 region:rollup2
HOUSING IN FUNDING IN THOSE

01:17:43.692 --> 01:17:46.262 region:rollup2
KINDS OF THINGS. AND I THINK

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:47.463 region:rollup2
WE'LL NEED TO START LOOKING AT

01:17:46.262 --> 01:17:48.931 region:rollup2
THAT MORE CAREFULLY INTO A

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:50.499 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR IN TERMS OF THE

01:17:48.931 --> 01:17:51.734 region:rollup2
GRANTS THAT WE GIVE ALL WE

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:54.069 region:rollup2
ASSUME IT'S CHEAPER TO GO TO A

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:55.804 region:rollup2
COMMUNICABLE IT. AND TECHNICALLY

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:58.140 region:rollup2
IT IS IF YOU ONLY LOOK AT. WHAT

01:17:55.804 --> 01:18:00.142 region:rollup2
THE FEES AND AND BOOKS BUT IF

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.710 region:rollup2
YOU LOOK AT THE THE FACT THAT

01:18:00.142 --> 01:18:03.212 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ASKED TO OFTENTIMES

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.781 region:rollup2
LIVE? AND.

01:18:03.212 --> 01:18:07.182 region:rollup2
AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES

01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:08.450 region:rollup2
AT THAT POINT IT BECOMES MORE

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:10.686 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE BECAUSE OUR

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:14.390 region:rollup2
DORMITORIES A CHEAPER THAN

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:14.390 region:rollup2
APARTMENTS AND. IT WAS TO GET

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:17.993 region:rollup2
FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS VERSUS

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.861 region:rollup2
THE TWO SO. WHAT WE'RE BUT WE'VE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.628 region:rollup2
WHERE WHERE THAT THE AT THIS

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.829 region:rollup2
LEVEL WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IS

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:22.431 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO? HOW

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:25.000 region:rollup2
TO RESPOND TO IT IN A WAY THAT

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:27.303 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE OF BECAUSE I

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.537 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES THE IMAGES WE HAVE?

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:30.072 region:rollup2
DICTATE POLICIES THAT THAT ARE

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.874 region:rollup2
NOT BENEFICIAL AND SO.

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.374 region:rollup2
WILL BEEN PLEASE WITH YOU WITH

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:36.779 region:rollup2
THAT SO THANKS FOR THE

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:37.813 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE STUDY

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:38.480 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DONE YES.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.448 region:rollup2
AND CAN I JUST MENTION ONE THING

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:40.649 region:rollup2
JUST TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK OFF

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:42.551 region:rollup2
WHAT I'M CALLING SIDE FROM THE

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:45.187 region:rollup2
CCC IS ABOUT CAL FRESH.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:46.689 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS A WAY TO EVEN

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:48.958 region:rollup2
EXPAND THE RESTAURANT MEALS

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:51.327 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT

01:18:48.958 --> 01:18:53.729 region:rollup2
BE WONDERFUL TO CONSIDER AND

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:55.264 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO THE EBT APPLICATION

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.599 region:rollup2
FOR CAMPUS IT'S BECAUSE RIGHT

01:18:55.264 --> 01:18:58.901 region:rollup2
NOW THE APPLICATION IS NOT SET

01:18:56.599 --> 01:19:01.437 region:rollup2
FOR COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

01:18:58.901 --> 01:19:02.438 region:rollup2
AND IT THERE'S INFORMATION

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:03.606 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING ASKED ON THERE

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:05.007 region:rollup2
THAT'S VERY HARD FOR COLLEGE

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:07.176 region:rollup2
CAMPUSES TO.

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:08.444 region:rollup2
ADDRESS SO IF THERE IS A WAY

01:19:07.176 --> 01:19:09.378 region:rollup2
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO EITHER

01:19:08.444 --> 01:19:10.946 region:rollup2
MAKE THAT.

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:12.681 region:rollup2
APPLICATION.

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:14.350 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT MORE FOCUSED FOR

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:15.884 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES SO THAT MORE OF

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:17.886 region:rollup2
OUR CAMPUSES CAN'T APPLY AND GET

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:18.887 region:rollup2
APPROVED THAT WOULD BE REALLY

01:19:17.886 --> 01:19:20.556 region:rollup2
HELPFUL.

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:21.890 region:rollup2
OKAY WILL HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:23.692 region:rollup2
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:25.694 region:rollup2
APPLICATION FOR CAO FRESH IS NOT

01:19:23.692 --> 01:19:27.496 region:rollup2
BEEN IS NOT TAILORED FOR STUDENT

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:30.165 region:rollup2
RIGHT IT'S FOR RETAILERS.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:32.134 region:rollup2
THAT IF JEFFREY BT I'M SORRY

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:34.370 region:rollup2
CARVE OUT FOR EDT IT'S FOR YOU

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:36.905 region:rollup2
KNOW RETAILERS CORNER STORE IT'S

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:38.007 region:rollup2
MARKETS. AND SO YOU KNOW ONE OF

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:40.409 region:rollup2
THE FIRST QUESTIONS ON THERE IS

01:19:38.007 --> 01:19:42.211 region:rollup2
LIKE WHAT KIND OF RETAILER ARE

01:19:40.409 --> 01:19:43.812 region:rollup2
YOU OR YOUR SOLE PROPRIETOR ARE

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:45.648 region:rollup2
YOU. AND SO OUR CAMPUSES DON'T

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:47.316 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY FALL INTO THAT SO

01:19:45.648 --> 01:19:48.284 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN SOME CAN SOME

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.085 region:rollup2
CONFUSION A LITTLE BIT OF

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:52.288 region:rollup2
CONFUSION AROUND THAT. AND THEN

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:54.657 region:rollup2
THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ASK FOR

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:56.792 region:rollup2
A PERSON SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:57.993 region:rollup2
AND DRIVERS LICENSE SO THAT

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.294 region:rollup2
MEANS SOMEONE ON OUR CAMPUS HAS

01:19:57.993 --> 01:20:01.330 region:rollup2
TO DO TO DO THAT OR GIVE THAT

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:03.265 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND IT. SO MAYBE IF

01:20:01.330 --> 01:20:04.433 region:rollup2
THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:06.402 region:rollup2
THAT A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY ON THE

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:07.336 region:rollup2
APPLICATION SO THAT IT OPENS IT

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:09.038 region:rollup2
UP MORE BECAUSE IF WE'RE

01:20:07.336 --> 01:20:10.773 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING OUR STUDENTS FOR CAL

01:20:09.038 --> 01:20:13.075 region:rollup2
TRASH. AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GO

01:20:10.773 --> 01:20:15.210 region:rollup2
OFF CAMPUS TO USE THOSE DOLLARS.

01:20:13.075 --> 01:20:16.712 region:rollup2
YOU NOTE SOMETIMES THAT THE

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:18.447 region:rollup2
BARRIERS WELL ESPECIALLY MORE

01:20:16.712 --> 01:20:19.415 region:rollup2
RULE COMMUNITIES WHERE MAYBE

01:20:18.447 --> 01:20:22.284 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOT A STORE THAT'S

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:22.851 region:rollup2
NEARBY MAYBE ONLY HAVE AN HOUR

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.119 region:rollup2
IN BETWEEN CLASS.

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.154 region:rollup2
SO JUST THINKING ABOUT WAYS

01:20:24.119 --> 01:20:27.122 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN KEEP OUR STUDENTS ON

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.590 region:rollup2
CAMPUS AND FOCUS ON THEIR SCHOOL

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:30.659 region:rollup2
WORK. DON'T SOME OF YOU CAMPUS

IS YOU HAVE EBT CARDS YEAH WE

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:34.797 region:rollup2
HAVE SIX CAMPUSES THAT OFFER EBT

01:20:32.795 --> 01:20:36.832 region:rollup2
ON CAMPUS OKAY AND THE OTHERS

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:38.967 region:rollup2
DON'T BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:40.636 region:rollup2
EITHER THE APPLICATION IS A

01:20:38.967 --> 01:20:42.304 region:rollup2
LITTLE DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:43.272 region:rollup2
OR THERE'S QUESTIONS AROUND AT

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:44.940 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:46.075 region:rollup2
APPLIED AND IT'S. A PROCESS

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.810 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY HAVE THEY MAKE IT

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:49.645 region:rollup2
DENIED FOR SOME REASON AND THEN

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:51.480 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO APPLY AGAIN I

01:20:49.645 --> 01:20:52.681 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IF YOU'RE DENIED.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.982 region:rollup2
ARE NOT APPROVED TWICE YOU HAVE

01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:56.585 region:rollup2
TO WAIT A YEAR BEFORE YOU CAN

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:58.087 region:rollup2
APPLY AND. SO EVEN HAVE ANY

01:20:56.585 --> 01:20:59.621 region:rollup2
CONNECTION I'M WE'RE TRYING TO

01:20:58.087 --> 01:21:01.290 region:rollup2
BUILD THAT CONNECTION NOW BUT TO

01:20:59.621 --> 01:21:02.691 region:rollup2
HAVE A CONNECTION TO SOMEONE.

01:21:01.290 --> 01:21:05.561 region:rollup2

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:06.862 region:rollup2
COLLEGE CAMPUSES SPECIFICALLY

YEAH LIAISON TO GO THROUGH THAT

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:11.533 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT COULD BE HELPFUL

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:11.800 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK INTO THAT YEAH BECAUSE

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:13.268 region:rollup2
I KNOW WE.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.603 region:rollup2

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.270 region:rollup2
EBT CARDS HAVE BEEN A BIG ISSUE

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:15.771 region:rollup2

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:15.143 region:rollup2
I THINK THIS BRINGS USED BY

01:35:13.408 --> 01:35:17.545 region:rollup2
LARGER POINT WHICH IS AS YOU FOR

01:35:15.143 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
TODAY FOOD IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:20.682 region:rollup2
DOESN'T EXIST ON OUR CAMPUSES

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:22.517 region:rollup2
IT'S ACCESSIBLE. BUT TO THINK

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:24.085 region:rollup2
ABOUT PAYING TEN DOLLARS EVERY

01:35:22.517 --> 01:35:25.853 region:rollup2
TIME YOU ON A SALAD OR ANYTIME

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.888 region:rollup2
YOU WANT A BURGER IS GONNA MAKE

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:27.956 region:rollup2
ANYONE GO BROKE.

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:29.324 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:35:27.956 --> 01:35:31.526 region:rollup2
HAVE A LARGER CONVERSATION

01:35:29.324 --> 01:35:32.594 region:rollup2
AROUND PARTNERSHIP. AND FOR THE

01:35:31.526 --> 01:35:33.962 region:rollup2
FOOD RETAILERS THAT WE HAVE ON

01:35:32.594 --> 01:35:35.964 region:rollup2
CAMPUS.

01:35:33.962 --> 01:35:37.432 region:rollup2
IF IT'S NOT FEASIBLE TO LOWER

01:35:35.964 --> 01:35:38.967 region:rollup2
THE COST OFSUBSIDIZE ACOSTA LOW

01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:41.002 region:rollup2
INCOME STUDENTS.

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:42.770 region:rollup2
THEN HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:41.002 --> 01:35:44.405 region:rollup2
THAT CONVERSATION THAT IS NOT

01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:46.307 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE ISN'T A BARRIER TO

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:49.143 region:rollup2
MEETINGS TO SHOW THAT EVERYONE

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:50.211 region:rollup2
HAS ACCESS TO THE SAME FOOD.

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:51.546 region:rollup2
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IN TWO

01:35:50.211 --> 01:35:52.580 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND TEN WE RISKS WE

01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:54.482 region:rollup2
WOULD RECEIVE INTEREST FORMS

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.384 region:rollup2
FROM FIVE TO SEVEN UNIVERSITIES

01:35:54.482 --> 01:35:58.319 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY EVERY MONTH.

01:35:56.384 --> 01:35:59.887 region:rollup2
THESE WERE ALWAYS FROM STUDENTS.

01:35:58.319 --> 01:36:01.189 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST YEAR FROM TWENTY

01:35:59.887 --> 01:36:02.690 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:04.359 region:rollup2
OVER HALF OF THE INTEREST FORMS

01:36:02.690 --> 01:36:05.360 region:rollup2
RECEIVE COME DIRECTLY ROM

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:06.894 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS AND DINING

01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:08.696 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS THEMSELVES.

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:10.098 region:rollup2
WE SEE THIS IS A HUGE SHIFT IN

01:36:08.696 --> 01:36:11.899 region:rollup2
THE WAY ABOUT PARTNERSHIPS ARE

01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:13.468 region:rollup2
STARTING TO COME TOGETHER. MY

01:36:11.899 --> 01:36:15.336 region:rollup2
FAVORITE ANALOGY LIKE TALK ABOUT

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:17.038 region:rollup2
OUR WORK IS BE IF YOU GIVE A

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:20.041 region:rollup2
MANIFESTS.

01:36:17.038 --> 01:36:22.644 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE'RE GIVING WE HAVE

01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:24.846 region:rollup2
THESE PANTRIES.

01:36:22.644 --> 01:36:27.615 region:rollup2
NO NO NO IT'S GONNA ORDER.

01:36:24.846 --> 01:36:29.384 region:rollup2
OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES WHETHER

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:31.786 region:rollup2
IT'S PENSIONS OUR MEAL VOUCHERS.

01:36:29.384 --> 01:36:33.054 region:rollup2
ARE GIVING OUR STUDENTS AFFAIRS.

01:36:31.786 --> 01:36:34.422 region:rollup2
WE'RE TEACHING OUR SCHOOLS HOW

01:36:33.054 --> 01:36:36.691 region:rollup2
TO FISH BY GIVING THEM THE

01:36:34.422 --> 01:36:38.126 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND BEST PRACTICES TO

01:36:36.691 --> 01:36:39.293 region:rollup2
UPDATE THE SCHOOLS THAT REFLECT

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.828 region:rollup2
THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS THAT

01:36:39.293 --> 01:36:42.463 region:rollup2
ARE PRESENT TODAY.

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.765 region:rollup2
AND IF WE WANT TO TAKE IT ONE

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:45.233 region:rollup2
STEP FURTHER. THAT'S

01:36:43.765 --> 01:36:47.602 region:rollup2
REVOLUTIONIZING THE FISHING

01:36:45.233 --> 01:36:49.370 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY HARDLY ME EXTRA FROM

01:36:47.602 --> 01:36:51.539 region:rollup2
THE GET GO EVERYONE HAS ACCESS

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:53.908 region:rollup2
TO FINISH THAT MEANS WE BRING ON

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:55.276 region:rollup2
MY ADVICE A VOTE OF NO THIS IS

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:56.611 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THE STATE CAN DO.

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:57.779 region:rollup2
IS LET'S TALK ABOUT THE CONTACTS

01:36:56.611 --> 01:36:59.080 region:rollup2
THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SIGNING

01:36:57.779 --> 01:37:01.282 region:rollup2
BOTH WITH OUR FOOD PROVIDERS

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.250 region:rollup2
WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:03.685 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT.

01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:05.219 region:rollup2
WE HOPE OUR STUDENTS INTERESTS

01:37:03.685 --> 01:37:06.721 region:rollup2
BEFORE ANYONE SHAREHOLDER

01:37:05.219 --> 01:37:08.856 region:rollup2
INTEREST

01:37:06.721 --> 01:37:10.258 region:rollup2
MAKING FOR A CONTRACTOR ETHICAL

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:13.594 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE MAKE SHOULD OWN IT

01:37:10.258 --> 01:37:15.596 region:rollup2
COMES TO FOOD AS A PIECE FINE.

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:16.931 region:rollup2
WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:19.100 region:rollup2
THIS A PIPELINE PROBLEM DOESN'T

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:21.202 region:rollup2
CONTINUE.

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:22.170 region:rollup2
AS A CLOSING NO.

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:24.038 region:rollup2
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:26.074 region:rollup2
INNOVATION AND AND PARTNERSHIP

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:27.308 region:rollup2

DO THE PEOPLE MOST HUMOR SO

01:37:29.177 --> 01:37:32.914 region:rollup2
DEALER JAPAN. I HOPE THAT WE

01:37:31.479 --> 01:37:33.715 region:rollup2
DON'T SCRAP.

01:37:32.914 --> 01:37:35.216 region:rollup2
THING THAT WE'VE LEARNED AT

01:37:33.715 --> 01:37:37.318 region:rollup2
THINGS WE PUT FORWARD BUT RATHER

01:37:35.216 --> 01:37:38.753 region:rollup2
REALLY INVEST IN INNOVATING ON

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:40.555 region:rollup2
TOP OF AMENDED RATING TO MAKE

SYSTEM WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE

01:37:44.459 --> 01:37:47.829 region:rollup2
