HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.583
CALIFORNIANS BOEING TEN POINT

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.719
THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN DEBT

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.486
SO THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:15.755
ISSUE. AND WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:18.992
IS THESE BORROWERS WHO MAY COME

00:04:19.058 --> 00:04:20.393

DIRTY PROCESS TO FILE SUIT

AGAINST THESE BORROWERS IN

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.908
COURT AND THE BORDERS IF THEY

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.176
ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:38.711
IN 91% OF THESE BORROWERS AS

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.612
THEY GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:41.147
ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:42.915
DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHAT TO DO.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:43.850
AND THE COURTS WILL THEN ENTER

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.518
A DEFAULT JUDGMENT NOW ONCE A

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:48.588
DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS ENTERED.

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:50.923
ANY PROBLEM OR DEFICIENCIES IN

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.059
THE FILING IS REALLY OVERCOME

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:54.927
BECAUSE THERE IS A DEFAULT

00:04:54.994 --> 00:04:56.896
JUDGMENT THAT IS ENTERED IN TWO

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.699
AGAINST THE BORROWER. AND THEN

00:04:59.766 --> 00:05:01.000
THAT DEFAULT JUDGMENT BECOMES

00:05:01.067 --> 00:05:02.835
ENFORCEABLE BUT IN MANY MANY OF

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.405
THESE CASES WE HAVE FOUND THAT

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.006
IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT THE

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.307
PARTY BRINGING THE CASE HAS THE

00:05:08.374 --> 00:05:09.575
RIGHT TO BRING THE CASE THEY

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.476
HAVE INSUFFICIENT

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.845
DOCUMENTATION. THEY CAN'T EVEN

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:13.479
ANSWER THE PROOF THAT THEY ALL

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.248
KNOW WELL THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:16.749
NECESSARILY CAN'T PROVE THAT

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.784
THEY SERVE IT ON THE RIGHT

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.919
INDIVIDUAL AND YET DEFAULT

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:20.820
JUDGMENTS HAVE BEEN ENTERED

00:05:20.887 --> 00:05:23.523
INTO. ALL THIS BILL DOES IS IT

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:24.891
ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:29.395
EVIDENTIARY STANDARD. FOR A

00:05:29.462 --> 00:05:31.197
LENDER OR A NEWS SERVICE OR WHO

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:32.999
WANTS TO FILE A SUIT AND GOING

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:34.233
TO COURT ASKING FOR SUMMARY

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.768

00:05:35.835 --> 00:05:37.837
STANDARDS OF DOCUMENTATION

00:05:37.904 --> 00:05:38.805
DOCUMENTING THE LONE

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.106
DOCUMENTING THAT THE PERSON

INVOLVED IN ENSURING THAT THAT

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:44.243
IF THEN A DEFAULT JUDGMENT IS

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.245
GOING TO BE ENTERED INTO IT IS

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.547
CORRECT THAT THEY HAVE THE

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:48.915
RIGHT TO DO THIS THEY OWN THE

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.717
LOAN THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:53.586

BY HAVING THE ABILITY. TO SAVE

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.708
DOLLARS. IN A PLACE THAT IS NOT

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:53.343

IS THE PENALTY FOR- FOR CERTAIN

00:47:04.955 --> 00:47:06.723
THINGS. AND SO WHAT WE'RE

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.725
LOOKING FOR IS TO CREATE A B.

00:47:08.792 --> 00:47:10.360
SEVENTY SEVEN- WHICH WOULD NOT

00:47:10.427 --> 00:47:11.261
CREATE A NEW BANK BUT IT WOULD

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:12.729
CREATE A STATE A STATE WIDE

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:14.665
RETAIL BANKING OPTION. THROUGH

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:15.699

ANALYSIS. A VERY RIGID MARKET

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:53.904
ANALYSIS THAT WOULD DETERMINE

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.239
THAT WHAT WE ARE. IF WHAT WE

00:47:55.305 --> 00:47:56.673

ALLOW US TO PUT THE FIRST PIECE

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:13.090

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:14.290
THINK ONE OF THE OPPOSITION

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:16.325
WEAKNESSES. I NOTED THAT IN A

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.060
RECENT FDIC SURVEY WE HAD

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:20.129
REACHED. A POINT IN WHICH ONLY

01:03:20.196 --> 01:03:23.232
FIVE POINT 4% OF AMERICANS ARE

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.033
NOW ON BANK. BUT WE STILL HAVE

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.234
A LONG WAYS TO GO THAT SAME

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:27.970
SURVEY ALSO FOUND THAT OVER 20%

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:29.272
OF AMERICANS ARE UNDERBANKED OR

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:30.873
UNBANKED. WHICH MEANS THAT THEY

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.708
ARE STILL VIEWING BANK ACCOUNTS

01:03:32.775 --> 01:03:33.943
AS A NECESSARY EVIL IS

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.244
SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO HAVE BUT

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:37.613
THEY'RE STILL RELYING HEAVILY

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.049
PRODUCTS- SO I THINK THIS IS AN

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.851
IMPORTANT POLICY GOAL. AND WE

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.752
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.420
OPTIONS AND I APPRECIATE THE

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:45.588
WAY IN WHICH THE AUTHOR

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.256
STRUCTURED THIS BILL. AS A

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.458
STUDY A MARKET ANALYSIS OF THE

01:03:49.525 --> 01:03:50.459
FEASIBILITY OF ONE TYPE OF

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.461
OPTION. THAT MIGHT SERVE AS A

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.796
COMPLEMENT TO SOME OF THE

01:03:53.863 --> 01:03:55.331
FINTECH AND OTHER PRODUCTS THAT

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:56.966
ARE DEVELOPING RIGHT NOW. I

01:03:57.033 --> 01:03:58.301
WOULD JUST SAY I APPRECIATE

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:01.637
pMEANS THAT HE'S TAKEN- I MIGHT

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:04.273
SUGGEST- ADDITIONAL.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.975
DIRECTIONAL APPROACHES HERE

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:07.510
FIRST I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.579
IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT THE

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.981
CRITERIA. THAT THIS BOARD IS

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:12.582
SUPPOSED TO LOOK AT IN

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.083
DEVELOPING ITS PROPOSAL THAT.

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:15.985
IT LOOK AT SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:18.588
AS A INDEPENDENT PILLAR- THAT

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:19.822
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:04:19.889 --> 01:04:21.591
ANYTHING WE THINK ABOUT AS A

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:22.792
LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE STATE

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:25.494
GOVERNMENT- THAT MIGHT HAVE.

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.562
THE IMPRIMATUR OF THE STATE

01:04:26.629 --> 01:04:29.332
BEHIND IT- NEEDS TO MAKE YOU

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.533
NEED TO FIRST AND FOREMOST BE

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.734
SOMETHING THAT'S SAFE AND SOUND

01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:34.237
THAT WILL NOT IMPLODE. BECAUSE

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.338
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE A

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.273
TRADITIONAL BANK IF WE DO THIS-

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:38.407
AS I UNDERSTAND THE STRUCTURE

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:41.110
WILL BE A PRIVATE INSTITUTION-

01:04:41.177 --> 01:04:42.411
BUT WITH A LOT OF STATE BACKING

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:44.113
BEHIND IT- THE SECOND THING I

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.381
THINK. THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:47.250
LOOKING AT ENSURING AS PART OF

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:48.718
THIS PROPOSAL IS CONSUMER

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:51.020
PROTECTION. SINCE THIS IS GOING

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.088
TO BE DELEGATED TO PRIVATE

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:53.589
INSTITUTION OR NETWORK OF A

01:04:53.656 --> 01:04:55.324
SERIES OF PRIVATE ACTORS. I

01:04:55.391 --> 01:04:56.492
WANNA MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.094
PROTECTION IS A CORE PART OF

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.428
WHAT'S BEING LOOKED AT SO I

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:00.396
HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL

01:05:00.463 --> 01:05:02.398
CONSIDER. ADOPTING THESE

01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:03.733
APPROACHES AS HE MOVES THIS

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.101
BILL OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE INTO

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:06.869
APPROPRIATIONS BUT- I INTEND TO

VOTE I TODAY BECAUSE I THINK WE

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.572
REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.641
OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO. HOW

01:05:11.707 --> 01:05:13.509

CONTINUED EFFORTS IN THIS AREA

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:47.743
I THINK IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT WE

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.979
CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD THIS

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:52.114
GOAL THAT FOR THE FOR THE

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.183
OPPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE THERE

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.353
REALLY IS NOTHING TO OPPOSE

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.623
NOTHING TO FEAR IT'S JUST A-

01:06:00.690 --> 01:06:01.891
THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:05.461
PROPOSED- ALMOST- YOU KNOW IT.

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.029
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO PUT IN AN

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.865
A WORD ON IT HONESTLY BECAUSE I

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.067
THINK IT'S JUST SAD THAT WE'RE

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.036
GETTING OPPOSITION. TO WANNA

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.639
FURTHER BANK. CALIFORNIANS WHEN

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.341
YOU LOOK AT THE FIVE POINT FOUR

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.543
FIGURE NATIONWIDE A NATIONWIDE

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:21.777
FIGURE WAS YOU WHOSE BECAUSE

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:23.512
CALIFORNIA'S GENERALLY IS GOING

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.247
TO BE MUCH HIGHER IN THIS AREA.

01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:26.682
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:28.884
MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

01:06:28.951 --> 01:06:32.488
COMPLETELY. UNBANKED ABSOLUTELY

01:06:32.555 --> 01:06:34.156
ZERO ACCESS TO BANKING SERVICES

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.358
AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER POOR

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:38.060
PEOPLE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF

01:06:38.127 --> 01:06:39.562
THEIR DEPOSITS GO TO ACTUALLY

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.764
PAY IN FEES. VERSUS SOMEBODY

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:43.566
THAT HAS HEALTHY DEPOSITS AND

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.668
HIGHER INCOME IT'S COMPLETELY

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:47.737
UNFAIR IT'S NOT A FAIR SYSTEM

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.705
OFTEN TIMES IF YOU HAVE HIGHER

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:52.908
DEPOSITS. YOU WILL PAY LESS FEE

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:55.010
FEES UNLESS BANKING COSTS SO

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:58.981
THIS SYSTEM. IS ALREADY

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:03.052
DESIGNED. TO GO CONTRARY IN IN

01:07:03.119 --> 01:07:04.887
IN IN NOT SUPPORTING PEOPLE

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.355
THAT WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING TO

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.491
GET INTO OUR ECONOMY HELPING

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:11.193
THEM TO GET- MAKE FINANCIAL

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.363
PLANNING LONG TERM FLYKNIT-FINANCIAL PLANNING DECISIONS

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.665
THAT HELP THEM. UP HAVE MORE

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.701
PROSPERITY OVER THE FUTURE SO

01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:20.970
I'M SORRY. TO THE BNKING

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.438
INDUSTRY OUT THERE OUR SYSTEM

01:07:22.505 --> 01:07:25.908
RIGHT NOW IS JUST NOT WORKING

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:26.442
FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE

01:07:26.509 --> 01:07:28.811
TRYING TO HELP TO TRY TO HELP

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:30.346

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.415
AMERICAN DREAM HELP TO. HELP

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:34.683
THEM TO MAKE WISER PLANNING

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.986
DECISIONS AND BANKING IS AN

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.155
ESSENTIAL PART OF THAT. WHEN

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:41.690
YOU CONSIDER THAT 90% OF THE

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:44.093
BUSINESSES THAT APPLY FOR

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.361
BUSINESS LOANS DON'T GET IT.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:49.865
90% THAT IS A VERY VERY SAD

01:07:49.932 --> 01:07:52.835
SAID NUMBER. FOR ANYBODY TO

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:55.037
COME TO US HERE AND SAY THAT

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.739
NOTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE THAT

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.741
EVERYTHING IS PERFECT HE'S NOT

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:00.376
THINKING OF THE 90% OF THE

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.578
BUSINESSES. OVER THE YEARS

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:03.712
THERE BEEN DIFFERENT

01:08:03.779 --> 01:08:04.914
INITIATIVES EITHER THROUGH

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:06.615
GOVERNMENT OR THROUGH BANKS

01:08:06.682 --> 01:08:08.617
THAT HAVE INCREASED ELIGIBILITY

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:10.386
AND THE RESULTS WERE THAT THE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:14.223
REPAYMENT RATES INCREASED SO IF

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:15.825
YOU ACTUALLY INCREASE

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:17.493
ELIGIBILITY THE REPAYMENT RATES

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:18.360
TO LEASE LOANS ARE GOING TO

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.895
ACTUALLY INCREASE THAT IS

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.630
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

01:08:21.697 --> 01:08:23.199
COMPELLING THAT REQUIRES US TO

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.801
MOVE TOWARD THIS. NORTH DAKOTA

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.304
HAS BEEN DOING THIS SINCE SINCE

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.904
NINETEEN FIFTEEN AND NOBODY'S

01:08:28.971 --> 01:08:30.773
BEEN TRYING TO UNDO THE NORTH

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.776
DAKOTA BANKS IT IS IT IS DOES

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.344
NOT I THINK THIS BILL. IS

01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:36.912
LEANING IN THAT DIRECTION TO

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.981
START STUDY SOMETHING THAT

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:39.548
COULD POTENTIALLY WORK LIKE

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:42.518
NORTH DAKOTA. AND BANKERS LOVE

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:43.886
THE NORTH DAKOTA BANKS SO WHY

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:45.387
DO THEY HATE THIS PROPOSAL IN

01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:48.023
CALIFORNIA. THE WHAT I'VE SEEN

01:08:48.090 --> 01:08:50.659
IS THAT ANYTHING HERE THAT EVEN

01:08:50.726 --> 01:08:52.695
INSINUATES ANY KIND OF

01:08:52.761 --> 01:08:55.598
COMPETITION. IS JUST COMPLETELY

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:59.301
REFUTED AND IN AND HAVING TO

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.336
PRESENT THIS AS A NEW

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.571
BUREAUCRACY AND NOT A NEW

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:03.973
BUSINESS AND INITIATIVE IS JUST

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:10.112
JUST. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. OF WHY.

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:13.849
THIS OPPOSITION IS COMPLETELY

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:17.286
COMPLETELY WRONG SO THIS NOBODY

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.687
SHOULD FEAR A STUDY NOBODY

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:22.324
SHOULD- FEAR FURTHER ANALYSIS

01:09:22.391 --> 01:09:24.627
NOBODY SHOULD FEAR THE STATE OF

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.862
CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO CREATE A

01:09:26.929 --> 01:09:29.632
PROGRAM TO BANK MORE OF ITS UP

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.600
MORE OF ITS COMMUNITY NOBODY

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.168
SHOULD FEAR THAT THIS SHOULD BE

01:09:33.235 --> 01:09:34.203
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE RALLY

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.038
AROUND I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:09:36.105 --> 01:09:37.406
ANYTHING FOR THE BANKING

01:09:37.473 --> 01:09:39.108
COMMUNITY FEAR I UNDERSTAND.

01:09:39.174 --> 01:09:40.509
WHY THEY'RE NOT POSITION I

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:42.144
UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS BUT-

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.580
THE REALLY THE ARGUMENTS IN

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:45.314
OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL ARE

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.349

LET'S LOOK AT IT LET LET IF

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.689
THE- IF IT'S SEEN AS NON VIABLE

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.457
THEN THAT'S THAT GIVES US A

01:09:55.524 --> 01:09:58.594
DECISION AND- BUT IF IT

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.696
PROVIDES US DIRECTION. WHY NOT

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:02.364
ENGAGE THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:04.867

BILL I'M SORRY THE MARKET

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:50.512
ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY THE

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.514
TREASURER'S OFFICE DOES NEED TO

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.416
COME BACK TO BOTH THE ASSEMBLY

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.584

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.853
FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS- TO

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.321
DECIDE TO TERMINATE HOW TO

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.023
PROCEED ONCE THE ANALYSIS IS

01:16:01.089 --> 01:16:07.329
COMPLETED. AND DID THAT ANSWER

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:09.464
YOUR QUESTIONS IN ORDER TO YES

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:11.066
I IT DID I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:16:11.133 --> 01:16:12.467
SURE THAT THAT IT'S NOT JUST

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:13.936
THE COMMITTEES AND THEN THEY GO

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.203
YEAH THAT'S A GOOD IDEA AND

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:16.972
THAT'S IT- I'M ASSUMING THAT IT

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.574
WHAT WHAT WILL COME BACK IS A

01:16:19.641 --> 01:16:21.510
IS A PROPOSAL AND THEN IT

01:16:21.576 --> 01:16:24.179
pOTHER THE OTHER THING IS THAT I

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:25.280
ALSO THINK WE NEED TO GIVE THE

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:27.282
COMMITTEE. THE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:16:27.349 --> 01:16:28.951
MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:31.019
WE MIGHT WANT TO. CHANGE THE

01:16:31.086 --> 01:16:32.854
PROGRAM IF IT. IF IT NEEDS IT

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.289
IN OTHER WORDS IF THAT MARKET

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:36.024
ANALYSIS COMES BACK AND SAYS.

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.592
LOOK THIS DOESN'T WORK. BUT IF

01:16:37.659 --> 01:16:39.728
YOU DO IT THIS WAY. IT COULD

01:16:39.795 --> 01:16:41.830
WORK I THAT THE BID COMMITTEE

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:42.998
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND TO

01:16:43.065 --> 01:16:44.499
US A DIFFERENT PATHWAY THAT

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:45.701
WOULD GET US WHERE WE WANT TO

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.336
GO. UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE WANT

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:50.205
TO DO. IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES.

01:16:50.272 --> 01:16:52.941

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:54.676
THE STATE THAT NEEDS A BANKING

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:56.478

MY COMMENTS WITH. MY PREVIOUS.

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:20.969
COMMENTS BY MY COLLEAGUES WHO

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:22.637
HAVE PREVIOUSLY SPOKEN ON THIS

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:26.408
MATTER. AND MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.843
SAN DIEGO CITY COULDN'T FIND

01:17:27.909 --> 01:17:29.311
THE WORDS TO DESCRIBE THE

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:31.213
BANKING JOB POSITION AND LET ME

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:32.614
JUST ADD IT I THINK IT'S

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.650
LAUGHABLE AS THE FORMER BANKING

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:38.020
CHEER I AM JUST BLOWN AWAY AT

01:17:38.086 --> 01:17:40.422
THE CONTINUED OPPOSITION TO

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.290
LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE METHODS

01:17:42.357 --> 01:17:44.793
I'M ALSO CHALLENGED APPS SOME

01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:46.928
OF US AS LEGISLATORS WHO. HAVE

01:17:46.995 --> 01:17:48.296
STOOD IN THE WAY OF SOME OF

THOSE OTHER VEHICLES THAT ARE

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:51.566
NOW AVAILABLE IN THE EXIT

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:53.769
SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR TRADITIONAL

01:17:53.835 --> 01:17:55.203
BANKING WAS NOT SERVING THOSE

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:56.571
CUSTOMERS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.540
ONLINE NINETY NOW THAT'S WHY WE

01:17:58.607 --> 01:18:00.308
HAVE PAYDAY LOANS THAT'S WHY

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:03.145
THOSE FOUR MARKETS EXIST NOW IN

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:04.279
CALIFORNIAACROSS THE COUNTRY

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.581
BECAUSE TRADITIONAL BANKING WAS

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.750
NOT. PROVIDING SERVICES TO

01:18:08.817 --> 01:18:10.552
THESE INDIVIDUALS AND EIGHT

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.087
YEARS AGO AS A MEMBER OF THE

01:18:12.154 --> 01:18:14.289
ASSEMBLY I AUTHORED A BILL

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.191
LOOKING AT THE UNDERBANKED

NEWSOM. AND WE HAD THE SAME

01:18:23.698 --> 01:18:25.200
LEVEL PUSH BACK EIGHT YEARS AGO

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:26.501
AND HERE WE ARE TODAY STILL

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:28.970
TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE SERVE

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.705
THE MILLIONS OF UNBANKED

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.907
CALIFORNIANS THAT EXISTS HERE

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:35.844
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:37.245
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. INTEREST

01:18:37.312 --> 01:18:40.515
RATES BANKING INTEREST RATES

01:18:40.582 --> 01:18:42.284
FOR OVERDRAFT PROTECTION- OVER

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.686
DRAFTING SO YOU GO TO STARBUCKS

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:47.122

WERE SQUABBLING THAT- LAST YEAR

01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:04.539
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ABOUT

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:06.074
310024100% THAT'S FAR CHEAPER

01:19:06.141 --> 01:19:07.843
THAN WHAT THE BANK CHARGES. AND

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:08.944
THAT'S WHY MANY OF THESE FOLKS

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.812
ARE AWAY FROM THE BANK BECAUSE

01:19:10.879 --> 01:19:12.047
THEY CAN'T AFFORD AS YOU

01:19:12.114 --> 01:19:14.082
STATED. FEES BANKS MAKE THE

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:16.351
MAJORITY OF THEIR PROFIT OFF OF

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.587
FEES AND SERVICES. I TRULY MAKE

01:19:18.653 --> 01:19:19.754
THE MAJORITY OF THEIR MONEY OFF

OF FEES AND OVERDRAFT

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.692
PROTECTION. CHARGES SO THIS IS

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:25.660
A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT'S

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:26.661
LONG OVERDUE WE'VE BEEN TALKING

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:29.131
ABOUT IT. FAR TOO LONG AND WE

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:30.966
DO NEED TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE

01:19:31.032 --> 01:19:33.034
METHODS FOR INDIVIDUALS TO COME

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:36.872

THAT ARE PROVIDED TO. PEOPLE OF

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.714
COLOR THEY'RE FAR LESS. OUR

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:48.950

01:19:49.017 --> 01:19:50.919

LOANS TO AFRICAN AMERICANS OR

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.576

TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE

UNBANKED THAN WHITE HOUSEHOLDS.

01:20:40.335 --> 01:20:42.737
THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE FEES. BUT

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:45.273
THEIR MONEY IS IN THAT BANK.

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.976

NEED THE MOST SERVICE AND

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:17.606
FRANKLY THERE WAS SOME COMMENTS

WORKING ON THIS BILL AND I

01:22:03.018 --> 01:22:04.619
THINK THIS BILL RESPONDS TO A

01:22:04.686 --> 01:22:06.221
VERY IMPORTANT FUNDAMENTAL

01:22:06.288 --> 01:22:07.856
ISSUED TO THE CONCEPT OF

01:22:07.922 --> 01:22:10.191
FINANCIAL INCLUSION AND

01:22:10.258 --> 01:22:12.294
FINANCIAL WELL BEING- MANY OF

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:14.262
US WHO HAVE BANK ACCOUNTS-

01:22:14.329 --> 01:22:15.330
SOMETIMES TAKE THEM FOR

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:17.432
GRANTED- WERE NOT REMINDED

01:22:17.499 --> 01:22:19.467
EVERY WEEK EVERY TRANSACTION

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.936
EVERY MONTH A MONTH- THE BURDEN

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:23.204
AND COST OF GETTING A PAYCHECKS

01:22:23.271 --> 01:22:24.773
CASHED AND GETTING. MONEY

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:27.075
ORDERS TO PAY RENT- BUT HAVING

01:22:27.142 --> 01:22:28.176
A BANK ACCOUNT IS OFTEN A

01:22:28.243 --> 01:22:30.679
PREREQUISITE ALSO FOR BUILDING

01:22:30.745 --> 01:22:32.881
HEALTHY FINANCIAL. THIS IS

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.416
ESTABLISHING A HEALTHY

01:22:34.482 --> 01:22:36.151
FINANCIAL LIFE BANK ACCOUNTS

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:38.053
OFTEN SERVE AS A FIRST STEP IS

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.020
TO MAINSTREAM FINANCIAL

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.456
SERVICES- CONSUMERS CAN GET

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:43.491
LOANS. CAR IN AND PURCHASE A

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:46.027
CAR OR A HOUSE THROUGH BANKS

01:22:46.094 --> 01:22:47.362
AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:22:47.429 --> 01:22:49.297
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE WHAT IT

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:50.999
MEANS TO BOTH HAVE A BANK

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:53.068
ACCOUNT BUT ALSO NOT HAVE A

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.903
BANK ACCOUNT- IN THE LIMITING

01:22:54.969 --> 01:22:56.838
OPPORTUNITIES. WE KNOW THAT

01:22:56.905 --> 01:22:58.273
BANK ACCOUNTS CAN BE RISKY FOR

01:22:58.340 --> 01:23:00.141
SOME CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY IF

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.242
THEIR BANK OR CREDIT UNION

01:23:01.309 --> 01:23:03.712
CHARGES HIGH FEES- IN OVERDRAFT

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:04.479
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S BEEN A

01:23:04.546 --> 01:23:06.581
COLLECTIVE SENTIMENT. ON IT YOU

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:08.483
KNOW OF THIS COMMITTEE SO WHILE

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:10.285
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.419
REALLY HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:12.520
WHAT OPTIONS DO WE HAVE TO

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:13.888
ADDRESS IT AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.256
BY SUPPORTING THIS BILL WEEK

01:23:15.323 --> 01:23:16.825
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHALLENGES OF

01:23:16.891 --> 01:23:19.527
MBANK CALIFORNIANS IS A

01:23:19.594 --> 01:23:21.730
PROBLEM. IT IS A PROBLEM THAT

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.298
NEEDS INVESTIGATION AND IS A

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.066
PROBLEM THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

01:23:25.133 --> 01:23:27.268
NEEDS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. AND

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.304
THEN CERTAINLY THE SUPPORT OF

01:23:29.371 --> 01:23:31.606
THIS BILL IS NOT JUST TO THINK

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.141
OF THE ONE OPTION BUT TO THINK

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:34.809
OF THE VARIOUS OPTIONS AT THIS

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:36.177
MARKET ANALYSIS CAN BRING

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:38.079
FORWARD WE NEED TO ADDRESS A

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:40.081
SERIOUS ISSUE. I DO LOOK

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.149
FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE

01:23:41.216 --> 01:23:43.017
MARKET ANALYSIS WHICH I HOPE

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.819
WILL PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE

01:23:44.886 --> 01:23:46.388
WITH BETTERINFORMATION ON HOW

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:48.056
WE NEED TO ACT AND HOW WE NEED

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.724
TO MOVE FORWARD. I WILL ALSO

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:51.559
NOTE THAT WE NOW HAVE TWO

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.495
SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDER WAY

01:23:53.561 --> 01:23:54.796
UNDER WAY TO TEST WHETHER

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.365
GOVERNMENT CAN ADD VALUE TO THE

01:23:57.432 --> 01:23:59.234
FINANCIAL SERVICES SPACE. TWO

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:02.404
YEARS AGO WE ENACTED AB EIGHT

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.937
FIVE SEVEN TO ALLOW LOCAL

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.239
GOVERNMENTS TO PURSUE PUBLIC

01:24:04.305 --> 01:24:05.807
BANKS IN THEIR JURISDICTION.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.543
NOW WE HAVE THIS BILL- AND ATE

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.412
IT THAT LOOKS TO MOVE FORWARD

01:24:10.478 --> 01:24:11.346
TO SEE HOW THE STATE CAN

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:14.115
ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF UNBANKED

01:24:14.182 --> 01:24:15.383

WANT TO EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO-

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:26.027
