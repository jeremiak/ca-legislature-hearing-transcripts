I WE HAVE A SUBSTITUTE TODAY IS SELLING MEMBER DEVON MATHIS HISTORY PLACE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BILL PEROT ON COMMITTEE TODAY MONDAY JUNE TWENTY FIFTH HEARING ONLY -- CONSENT CALENDAR IS ITEM SEVEN SP FIFTEEN OH AIN'T -- CORPORATE TAXATION VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS QUALIFIED ENTITIES WITH AMENDMENTS. SO WITH THAT. FILE ITEM ONE S. B. [inaudible] TWO TWO SEVEN SENATE. WE'RE ACTING AS A SUBCOMMITTEE UNTIL HE GETS MORE MEMBERS BUT CENTER DAILY ON WHAT YOU. FIGURE MUCH -- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND IN ABSENCE JUST -- MISTURA. VICE CHAIR I KNOW MISTER. VON MATHIS IS HERE AND SUBSTITUTED BY SEVERAL ONE THANK YOU WATCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO PRESENT SENATE BILL -- TWO TWO SEVEN MADAM CHAIR -- COLLEAGUES AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS OF FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE I WENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT IF YOU STAFF MEMBERS. AND THERE ARE GOOD WORK. AS YOU KNOW MADAM CHAIR MISPLACED YOUR REPUBLICANS LAST JUNE WASHINGTON RUSH TO PASS A GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE TAX PLAN AND CORPORATIONS MORE THAN A ONE TRILLION DOLLAR. TAX BREAK AT OUR EXPENSE. THIS TAX SCAM DELIBERATELY TARGETS AMERICANS IN BLUE STATES IT QUITE FRANKLY DUE TO VOTE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP. NICK COULD CAUSE CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY -- COULD COST CALIFORNIANS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FACT THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYER ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM DEDUCTED OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THEIR STATE AND LOCAL TAXES SALT -- ON A FEDERAL RETURNS OF LAST YEAR. NOW THAT DEDUCTION IS CAPPED AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS A HARD CAP NOT A FLOOR BUT A HEART CAT MEANING THAT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. WILL LOSE OUT ON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. VALUABLE DEDUCTIONS EACH YEAR ON THEIR FEDERAL TAXES. SENATE BILL TWO TWO SEVEN IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE. A FOOT THE BILL FOR THIS RIDICULOUS TAX GIVEAWAY BY GIVING THEM A CHARVEL OUTLET THAT WILL HELP THEM WHILE HELPING OUR SCHOOLS. SO THE BILL TO DO SO WOULD CREATE A FUND THAT TAXPAYERS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOCAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS FUND AND EIGHT IN EXCHANGE RECEIVE A REDUCTION IN THEIR STATE TAXES. THAT FUND WOULD BE MANAGED AND ITS RESOURCES ALLOCATED BY THE FISCAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE TEAM. AND INDEPENDENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY. THE CREDIT POLL WOULD BE LIMITED TO FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR AND EACH FISCAL YEAR THEREAFTER. THE CREDIT WOULD BE HONORED AT THE RITUAL LANGUAGE -- WHEN THE BILL WAS IN THE SENATE WAS 1100% IT'S AT 85% AND EVERY DOLLAR CONTRIBUTE TO THE FUND? THEN RELYING ON LONG STANDING FEDERAL CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION RULES ONE MEASURE THAT I WROTE IT'S CODIFIED STATUTORY LAW WITH REGARD TO DEALING WITH CAL GRANTS ITS CREDIT AT FIFTY CENTS THIS ONE'S AT EIGHTY FIVE CENTS WHICH IS LAW OF THE LAND IN CALIFORNIA. THAT TAXPAYER CAN DEDUCT THE AMOUNT LISTED ON THERE SIR CERTIFICATION FROM THE FEDERAL TAXES. EXACTLY AS THEY WOULD HAVE UNDER UNDER STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS CAPPED. WE ALSO HAVE A CUP COMPANION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AS CA THIRTY NINE WHICH PROTECTS ALL OVER EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULAS. MAKING SURE WE MEET ALL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE ADMINISTERING THIS CREDIT. ULTIMATELY WOULD BENEFIT THE STATE AND ITS TAXPAYERS IF WE OFFERED A MENU OF CHARITABLE OPTIONS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR CHARBEL -- GIVING TO WORK. TAKEN TOGETHER WITH YOUR OF BILL. ONE SEVEN THIS MEASURE AND ANOTHER MEASURE IT WAS HEAVILY THIS COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW SOMETIME NEXT WEEK WHICH IS S. B.. FIVE THIRTY NINE WILL OFFER CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THE MENU OF OPTIONS HELPING THEM GIVE TO THE CAUSE OF THEIR CHOICE BY DOING SO WE WILL ALLOW. THE TAXPAYERS A CALL FOR YOU TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BETTERMENT OF OUR STATE HELPING CALIFORNIA'S WHILE THEY HELP THEMSELVES THIS MEASURE WILL PROTECT OVER THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WITH THAT. MANAGER MISTER VICE CHAIR OUR RESPECT WE ASK FOR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU IN THIS IS IN SUPPORT YEAH. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS KIRK STARK ON THE LAW PROFESSOR UCLA -- AND I JUST WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS -- BILL -- CURRENTLY THERE ARE THIRTY THREE STATES AND OVER ONE HUNDRED PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT OFFER CHARITABLE TAX CREDITS -- IN SUPPORT OF ONE TYPE OF PROGRAM OR ANOTHER ESTABLISHED BY. A STATE GOVERNMENTS OF THESE PROGRAM. LIKE -- SP TWO TWO SEVEN THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE DONORS WITH TAX CREDITS -- SOMETIMES STANGEL -- AS MUCH AS 1100% FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO GOVERNMENT DESIGNATED FUNDS AND ACTIVITIES. OF THESE INCLUDE CONSERVATION EASEMENT GIFTS. PRIVATE SCHOOL TUITION SCHOLARSHIPS. SHELTERS FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO ARE VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. RURAL HOSPITALS A AND MANY OTHER. A GOVERNMENT SPECIFIED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES -- AND THESE PROGRAMS ALL REYES -- WHAT TO ME AT LEAST AS A LAW PROFESSOR IS A VERY INTERESTING -- LEGAL QUESTION. CHOOSE WHETHER OR NOT A TAXPAYER CAN DEDUCT. THE FULL AMOUNT OF A DONATION THAT HAS THE AFFECT OF REDUCING. HER STATE TAX LIABILITY. AND FOR THE PAST. ONE HUNDRED PLUS YEARS. THE IRS AND THE COURTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY ALLOWED TAXPAYERS TO CLAIM A FULL DEDUCTION. FOR THE AMOUNT OF THEIR DONATION. UNDIMINISHED. BY THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX BENEFITS ARISING FROM MAKING THAT GIFT -- SO THE MAJOR VALUE OF SP TWO TWO SEVEN ALONG WITH. AB -- TWO TWO ONE SEVEN AND THE STATE'S EXISTING TAX CREDIT. FOR THE COLLEGE ACCESS TAX CREDIT FUND FOR CAL GRANTS -- USE. TO PROVIDE DONORS IN CALIFORNIA WITH CHOICES. REGARDING HOW TO SUPPORT. CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES INCLUDING THE ACTIVITIES OF STATE. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- THIS IS CHARACTERISTIC OF ALL CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS -- AND THIS LEGISLATION -- LIKE THESE MANY EXISTING PROGRAMS. GIVES TAXPAYERS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. TO SUPPORT CHARITABLE ACTIVITIES -- AND I THINK IT'S IT'S WORTHY OF YOUR SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKERY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE WE DO UNDERSTAND THE CREATIVITY AND THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO USE IN ORDER TO TRY TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS UNFORTUNATELY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS PROTECTION WOULD COME AT THE COST OF EDUCATIONAL FUNDING. AND WE HAVE BEGUN TAKING A VERY DEEP LOOK AT THIS AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THAT FUNDS EDUCATION. OUT WERE PARTICULARLY CONCERNED IN YOUR WERE BEGINNING TO HAVE AS A POSITIVE TREND MOVING FORWARD IN EDUCATION FUNDING THAT WHILE WE'RE GETTING MORE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION IN THE BUDGET. MEASURES SUCH AS THIS COULD NOT ONLY ON DO ALL THE SIGNIFICANT THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN EDUCATION FUNDING BUT COULD ACTUALLY DECIMATED AND A MUCH GRANDER LEVEL SO WE DON'T SUPPORT THE MEASURE MOVING FORWARD WHILE WE DO APPRECIATE THE ATTEMPT IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT IS ONLY GOOD FOR TAXPAYERS ON IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR FUTURE TAXPAYERS IF IT'S AT THE COST OF OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL FUTURE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] MR MATHIS. SENATOR YOU SAID EARLIER TAKING THE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE -- MY QUESTION TO YOU IS ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE A AN AMENDMENT. THAT IS GOING TO FOR TAX CUTS CALIFORNIANS FROM THE IRS IF THEY COME BACK AND ROLL AGAINST THIS. IF IF I KNOW IT'S BEEN PART OF THE DEBATE ARMS LIKE OR ARE YOU ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE THAT AMENDMENT TO PROTECT THEM IN CASE IT COMES BACK. BECAUSE I MEAN I I THINK THE LAST THING ANY OF US WANT TO SEE IS PEOPLE GET. PENALIZED. FOR SOMETHING AND I KNOW THEY'RE WORKING ON THIS RIGHT NOW SO MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE -- AND THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD WAIT AND TELL THEIR IRIS RULINGS DON -- VERSES ROLLING THIS OUT NOW BUT IF YOU TOOK AN AMENDMENT TO PROTECT THEM. YOU KNOW A AGAINST THE NEGATIVE RULING. THEN THAT I'D BE WILLING TO SUPPORT IT BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT IF IT COMES AYE NEGATIVELY THEN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR TAXPAYERS INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY HELPING THEM. INTERNAL ORGAN HARM THEM ACTUALLY LIVE WITH I COULDN'T ACTUALLY FLIP IT AROUND I THINK RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN TRY THERE'S HARM BEING DONE TO THE TAXPAYERS WHY NOW IF THERE'S A NO VOTE. ON HIS MEASURES ONE BE VERY CLEAR. IF THERE IS NO ONE IS MEASURED THERE'S A VOTE. TO TAX THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WITH YOU DEMOCRAT ARE POP AND I THINK THAT'S WHY -- ON THE SENATE SIDE OF CENTERS CANNELLA AS WELL AS WILK VOTED YES OF WAS MEASURE. THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER OF BEING THE SPEIGHTS -- MISTER BERRYHILL MISTER GAINES AS WELL AS LE OF FEW OTHER REPUBLICS OF TOP MY HEAD I CAN REMEMBER. THE OLD IN VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS WORK FOR YOU. VOTE KNOWN AS MEASURE ACTUALLY FROM WILL BE VOTING YES TO RAISE TAXES ON THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THAT'S ACROSS THE SPECTRUM BUT WHO IF YOU HAVE ANY LANGUAGE I WOULDN'T AGREE TO IT OBSCENE REAL TIME DURING THE COMMITTEE BUT BE MORE HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH YOU WITHOUT QUESTION ALL THE GOT GOING MORE HAVE DAYS LONGER. YOU NOTIFY ME. AND VICE VERSA BUT WE KNOW HOW MUCH OF AND WE JUST TO BE CLEAR THE CAN WE'VE NEVER HAD. LANGUAGE BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE ON INTIMATE ON INDEMNIFICATION SO TO BE CLEAR THAT WAS NOT THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE WERE AND THEY YOU'VE AGREED TO TAKE HER TO ACCEPT THE FIVE YEAR SUNSET FOR THE TAX CREDIT. BUT TAKING AN EDUCATION COMMITTEE YES AND IN VERY VERY PRUDENT -- AMENDMENTS THAT YOU CAN USE OFFER TO US SO WE BUT WILLINGLY AND AND AND AND HAPPILY ACCEPT AMENDMENTS DEEMED STATE EARLIER. YEAH MISTER. TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M A DAMN SURE JUST. TO ADDRESS THIS CPA'S CONCERN -- IS JUST BILL. TOUCHES HER PROPOSITION NIGHT HERE OR CHANGED A MINIMAL -- GUARANTEE ON A PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT UNFORTUNATELY WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE MEASURE WOULD IMPACT PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS I BELIEVE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IN SO WE DO BELIEVE IT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT IT'S UNCERTAIN TO TELL EXACTLY. HOW WITH HUMAN BEHAVIOR IS GOING TO BE AT THIS TIME TO ASCERTAIN EXACTLY WHAT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT IS BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT -- FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POP NINETY IN EDUCATION MOVING FORWARD AND I DO WANT TO SPECIFY THAT WHILE WE DO ENCOURAGE -- I KNOW BUT WE KNOW WE AND SUPPORT. AND YOU SET UP -- TAKING PLACE WOOD SALT O. WE DON'T SUPPORT THAT AS WELL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SOLUTION DOESN'T DO ANY HARM TO EDUCATE. THE SENATOR COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY -- TOUCH THAT PROPOSITION NIKE BUT LET ME SAY THE FOLLOWING IS THAT IN A VERY RESPECTFUL OF OBVIOUS IN A MISS BAKER AND AND THE THE ORGANIZATION SURE PRESENTS SOME OF USED TO WORK THERE ON BUT COME AT AS WE DRESSES. THIS THIS TAX CONUNDRUM I WOULD SAY THAT -- WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH THE SOLUTION WHICH IS SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS AND NUMBER THIRTY NINE WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD PROTECT. ANY PROP NINETY EIGHT EDUCATIONAL FUNDING FORMULAS ARE BY NO STRETCH OF IMAGINATION WOULD WE EVER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TRY TO USURP YOU KNOW PROP NINETY EIGHT WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF PROP. NINETY EIGHT ALWAYS HAD BEEN A STRONG SUPPORT PROP NINETY IT WILL ALWAYS BE STRONG SCORES NINETY THEN MORE CONTINUES OF FUNDING -- FOR CHILDREN AT THE LOCAL ELEAZAR BUT ON THE CITY CALIFORNIA OF THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE THE COMPANION A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT COMPANION WHICH IS IN A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT A NUMBER. THIRTY NINE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT COMMITTEE THAT PASS BEFORE THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY IN THE LANGUAGE TO DO SEVEN BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE MEASURE THAT GOES WITH THIS MEASURE. THAT WOULD PROTECT WE BELIEVE THE SANCTITY. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND TO BE CLEAR THAT ISSUE IS WHY IT'S GOING TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE AFTER THIS. PROP NINETY EIGHT IS THE REASON IT'S GOING TO GO TO EDUCATION COMMITTEE AFTER THAT SO THEY'LL HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONON THAT ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS IN COMMITTEE. SEEING AND HEARING AND SENATOR WOULD LIKE CLOTHES. FIGURE MUCH -- AMEND CHARGES ONE I THINK YOU MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE NAY RECYCLING* WHEN I VOTE.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. MY NAME'S KEVIN RICHARDSON THEM WITH THE WE POURS PROJECT I'M A VETERAN A MARINE VETERAN AND A SUICIDE SURVIVOR I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY IF IT WAS NOT FLORA COMPASSION CANNABIS.

OVER SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO VETERANS COMMITTED SUICIDE. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE AND THAT'S HIGHER THAN THE AVERAGE ACROSS THE THE NATION AND VOTING NO ON THIS IS GOING TO SIGN A LOT MORE VETERANS DEATH WARRANTS. I MANEUVERS CREATOR IS AN AYE -- HELP.

LICENSEE IS ABLE TO HAVE A COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAM I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC AND I WOULD BE THE INTENT OF OF THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT STE AND I THINK THAT NOT ONLY. A OMA LICENSEES BUT RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE FOR EXAMPLE THE AMERICAN CHURCHES. ON SHOULD ALSO BE LICENSED -- TO GIVE AWAY COMPASSIONATE CARE MEDICINE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY DO. AND THEY AREN'T -- THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY TAXES -- BUT THIS WAY THEIR LEGITIMATE COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAMS AND LOOKED AND TREATED EQUAL JUST LIKE. YOU KNOW THE REAL M.. LICENSEES IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL -- WOULD BE TREATED AND ALREADY THERE'S A LOT OF SITES LIKE WE'D MASS THEY ASK FOR WHICH YOU'RE LESS STATE LICENSE NUMBER WHAT'S YOUR STATE LICENSE SUMMER BUT YOU NO FOR EXAMPLE. A LOT OF CHURCHES THEY DON'T HAVE A STATE LICENSE NUMBER BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT REGULATED FOR CHURCHES YET. OR WILL NOT LICENSE CHURCHES -- FOR A COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAM OR TO SELL CANNABIS AND I THINK THAT IT'S JUST A SIGN OF THE TIMES THAT CHURCHES NOW WANT. TO SELL CANNABIS AND GIVE IT AWAY ONLY BECAUSE IT'S LEGAL AND THERE'S AN ALTERNATIVE ALCOHOL AND IT'S A HEALTHIER ALTERNATIVE SO FEW.

LAW ENFORCEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT CALIFORNIANS THAT PLAY BY THE RULES AS CENTER GALGIANI MENTIONED -- WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAT ARE ESTIMATED. AT THAT IS LOST AS ON COLLECT YEAR. CALIFORNIA'S LEAD THE WAY ON CARP COMBATING THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN STATE AGENCIES JOIN FORCES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM ESTABLISHING THE TAX RECOVERY AND CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE OR TRACE. OUR CORE PARTNERS INCLUDE THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IN THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. TOGETHER WE LEVERAGE OUR EXPERTISE IN PULL OUR INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES WE DO THIS TO COMBAT EGREGIOUS FELONY LEVEL. TAX EVASION CRIMES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WE STARTED IN SACRAMENTO AND THEN EXPANDED TO LOS ANGELES IN JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS OUR TEAMS HAVE IDENTIFIED. TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION IN UNREPORTED GROSS RECEIPTS AND FORTY SIX MILLION AND ASSOCIATED TAX LOSS TO THE STATE WE'VE RECOVERED MILLIONS INTACT LOST TAX REVENUES BY GOING. AFTER UNSCRUPULOUS BUSINESSES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THINGSLIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING SELLING COUNTERFEIT GOODS LIKE -- ILLEGAL PHARMACEUTICALS THAT ARE UNREGULATED -- UNREGULATED BACKHOE PRODUCTS COSMETICS LIKE OFTENTIMES CONTAIN HARMFUL INGREDIENTS ARM THESE FOLKS.

WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED WITH WHAT WITH FIGHTING THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY THOUGH SP TWELVE SEVENTY TWO APPARENTLY ESTABLISH A TRACE TASK FORCE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE BILL WOULD GIVE THE TASK FORCE THE SUPPORT IT NEEDS TO INVESTIGATE. THESE CRIMES AND RECOVER THE TAX REVENUE THAT HELP KEEP. OUR STATE STRONG WE WITH STRENGTHENS TEAMS WE HAVE IN SACRAMENTO LOS ANGELES AND BUILD NEW ONES IN SAN DIEGO THE BAY AREA AND FRESNO. THIS WOULD ALLOW THE TRACE TASK FORCE TO MORE EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY FIGHT UNDERGROUND ECONOMIC CRIMES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE. THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAYS TO COLLECTING [inaudible] STATE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JEREMY SMITH YOUR BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL LIKE ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH THE DOES THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WE ARE YOUR SUPPORT. RENEE BAYARDO SEIU CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. WHEN IS IT OPPOSITION? MADAM CHAIR AND READ WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AYE PATROLMAN AYE SHOULD HAVE COME UP AS SUPPORT BECAUSE WE LIKE THE BILL. THE HYPED ALSO SHE SHE LIKES BUT WE WE'RE HERE TO ASK FOR ONE AMENDMENT A SIMPLE ONE TO ADD THE CHP THE DEPARTMENT HIGHWAY PATROL TO THE TRACE TASK FORCE -- I'VE TALKED TO THE STAFF THEY RESIST THAT I DON'T KNOW WHY. THE CHP HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF ISSUING OF WARRANTS AS RELATES TO THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY -- WE TOOK OVER THE STATE POLICE FUNCTIONS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO SO MANY OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ARE STILL PERFORMED BY SEVERAL HUNDRED CHP OFFICERS THAT WERE ALL THE OLD STATE. POLICE DUTIES -- THEY'VE DONE TAX SEIZURES ILLICIT THINGS COME ACROSS OUR BORDERS SOME PEOPLE SMUGGLE IN TOBACCO ALCOHOL TO AVOID. TAXES ERA BECAUSE TAXES ARE HIGHER HERE THAN THEY ARE IN SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING STATES SO WE CAN SIMPLY ASKED. AND OFFERED TO HAVETHIS HUGE PAY AS A MEMBER OF THE TRACE TASK FORCE AND THE STAFF FOR WHATEVER REASON. DON'T WANT TO DO THAT I THINK THE AUTHOR AND I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BETRAY HER SPONSOR AND I RESPECT HER FOR THAT. SO I'M ASKING FOR THE COMMITTEE TO OFFER THE AMENDMENT TO ADD THE CHP TO THE TRACE TASK FORCE. SO THAT SHE DOESN'T VIOLATE ANY KIND OF RELATIONSHIP SHE HAS WITH HER SPONSOR BUT I BELIEVE IF YOU ASKED HER A QUESTION. WITCHY WHAT WOULD SHE SAY THE CHP ADDS VALUE TO EVERYTHING THEY DO. AND IF I WERE IN CHARGE IF I WERE IN CHARGE OF DOJ I WOULD WELCOME THIS HUGE PEAS ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE'S A LOT MORE OF THEM THAN THERE ARE A LOT FOR SPENT WITHIN DOJ. SO MY REQUEST IS THAT SOMEBODY ON THE COMMITTEE OFFERED AN AMENDMENT TO ADD THE CHP TO THE TRACE TASK FORCE. AND I STARTED LATE I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO ANYBODY BECAUSE I WAS TALKING TO THE AUTHOR. FIRST AND WE JUST CONCLUDED THAT YESTERDAY [inaudible] WELL WAIT. TELL WILL WAIT TO ADDRESS THAT. BUT THE AUTHOR. WELL WAIT WILL WILL WAITING AND QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS ADDRESS I WITH THE AUTHOR. AND TURNED MEMBERS JOHN NORWOOD ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA POOL AND SPA ASSOCIATION WE ALSO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU. I THINK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT GOING TO BE ADDED. POSITION [inaudible] OKAY. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR QUIRK BOB SO. IT COMMITTEE ASKED FOR AN AMENDMENT SAYING ONLY LAW OFFICERS OR POLICE OFFICERS COULD LOOK AT THE DATA BUT AT SOME POINT -- DON'T LAWYERS HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IN ORDER. TO DETERMINE ARE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A RECENT OR THE PROSECUTORS SAY WITHIN DOD DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. DON'T THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT IT ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S A REASON TO PROSECUTE [inaudible] OKAY. THE IT SO THE AGENCY CONSISTS ARE THE TASK FORCE CONSISTS OF AN EXECUTIVE BOARD CONSISTING OF FOUR CORE AGENCIES IN -- THE THREE MAIN TAXING AGENCIES BEING ONE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BEING THE OTHER. AND WITHIN THAT EXECUTIVE BOARD -- THOSE AGENCIES CAN SHARE INFORMATION AND IN FACT AS A AS THE AGENCY THAT REPRESENTS THESE. THE DOJ REPRESENTING THESE AGENCIES IN CORPS WE HAVE THAT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHERE WERE ABLE. TO EXAMINE INFORMATION -- AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION AND THE PROSECUTION. OKAY THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE DUMB ABDUCTOR MISTER TING. THANK YOU MANAGER JUST SOME. QUESTIONS -- FOR BOTH THE SENATOR AND OR THE DOJ. OF RELIGIOUS REVIEWING THE ANALYSIS. THEY ANNOUNCED IT HAD A HARD TIME DISCERNING. ARM WHAT HAD BEEN DONE ON THIS ISSUE. ON WHAT WAS GOING TO BE DONE IN THE FUTURE I HAD A VERY. DIFFICULT TIME AS WELL JUST DISTURBING THE TWO DIFFERENT ACRONYMS. ONE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED BY MY FORMER COLLEAGUE FROM COULD CHALLENGE LEGISLATION TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THIS NEW LEGISLATION JUST TORN UNDERSTAND. WOULD YOU HAVE ALMOST DONE. IDENTICAL OVERLAP WITH THE AGENCIES IN DOING THIS ARE I THINK THIS ISSUE IS EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT I DON'T I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES THAT WE SHOULD BE TACKLING. BUT ON NOT REALLY SURE WHY. THIS NEW APPROACH. VERSUS THE OLD APPROACH. THE SAME AGENCIES JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE. YOU KNOW WE JUST CHANGE WARDROBES BUT NOT REALLY GETTING ANY DIFFERENT RESULTS ATTRACTED A BETTER STATE OF WHAT'S BEEN DONE WHAT THE RESULTS ARE IN WHY WE? NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS CHANGE. BUT CIVIC EXCEPT FOR THE ONE LETTER CHANGE. ALL FOR OF ALL SAY THAT I'M WHEN I'M WHEN I STARTED WITH THIS BILL THE IDEA WAS TO EXPAND BECAUSE PREVIOUSLY IT HAD BEEN FOR SACRAMENTO. AND LOS ANGELES SO WE WANTED TO MAKE A PERMANENT AND WE WANTED TO EXPAND IT TO FRESNO AND THE BAY AREA. AND SAN DIEGO AND WE PARTNERED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND MYSELF AND AND ALL THAT. TOMORROW TAKE IT FROM HERE. DOES SO YOU'RE REFERRING THE RATES PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THE TRACE PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED -- TO ESSENTIALLY -- TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE INFORMATION SHARING THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY RACE BUT BRINGING THE IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMPONENT -- WITH WITH TRACE AND SO RECOUP RACE CONSISTED OF THE COR AGENCIES -- RACE CAME OUT WITH A REPORT THIS YEAR SUMMARIZING THE PROGRAM WITH RECOMMENDATIONS IN IN THAT PROGRAM THEY RECOMMEND THAT TRACE MOVE FORWARD WHILE RACE SUNSETS. I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE TRACE REALLY PROVED TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT MODEL -- NOT THAT NOT ARE AYE NOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR AROUND WAY AND REYES WE'RE TRAITS WERE CREATED BUT WE DO YOU THE PROGRAM AND THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE -- OR LAW ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEYS THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS AND WE SEE THE GOOD WORK THAT IT DOES AND WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IT CONTINUE -- IT'S BROUGHT UP FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN USING EXISTING RESOURCES IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN COURT ORDERED RESTITUTION. WITH THIRTY MILLION PLUS ON THE HORIZON -- AND WE THINK THAT BY -- STRENGTHENING THE TEAMS IN SACRAMENTO IN LA AS WELL AS EXPANDING TO THE OTHER MAJOR METROPOLITAN REGIONS IN THE STATE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION HAS DONE EXTENSIVE WORK ON THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY ISSUED A REPORT OVER TO UNDER FIFTY PAGES TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS -- WENT THROUGH SOME OF THE CONFUSION AND CONVOLUTED HISTORY WITH RACE AND TRACE HIGHLIGHTS THAT TRACES HAD PROMISING RESULTS. AND SHOULD CONTINUE AND IN FACT THEIR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT IT SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO EVERYBODY MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREA IN THE STATE WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL DOES IN THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION'S ACTUALLY SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THAT THANK YOU CRITICIZED HER ARM. CONSULTA CLARIFY BECAUSE AND CARLOS'S ANALYSIS IT WASN'T CLEAR THAT THAT WAS THERE. RECOMMENDATIONS CAN YOU JUST CONFIRM THAT WOULD DEAL JUSTICE TRUE THAT THE THAT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS FOR RACE TO SUNSET AND FOR TREES TO MOVE FORWARD. AND WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR IN THEIR IN THE RACE REPORT. ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE RATIO PORT THAT WAS -- AUTHORIZED OR REQUIRED BY A. B. FI SEVENTY SIX I BELIEVE SO THAT THE REPORT YOURSELF YES THE RACE YOU POOR I RECOMMEND THAT TREES MOVE FORWARD -- BUT THE RATIO POUR ó. OR WAS SUPPOSED WE'VE WITH RESPECT TO RACE [inaudible] NOT TRACE -- TRACE OUR WAS A RECOMMENDATION WITHIN THE RATIO POOR BUT IT WAS ODD. THAT THE TRACE WOULD BE RECOMMENDED SINCE IT WAS ONLY FOR THE RACE PROGRAM. I I'M A TIME CONFUSED WHAT WAS THE ACTUAL RECOMMENDATION THE RECOMMENDATION WAS THAT TRACE PEOPLE WHO HOLD TO FUSE. FOR NUMBER YEAR SO THIS IS NO AND NO. YES THE RECOMMENDATION BY THE RACE REPORT WAS THAT TRACE MOVE FORWARD. BUT WITH IN BUT WITHIN THE RACE PROGRAM WAS A LISTS FOR A SEPARATE ENTRANCE OR NO IT WAS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT TREES MOVE FORWARD AND THAT RACE BE SUNSET IT. THANK YOU AND AND THEN JUST INTO IN TERMS OF CLAIRE CLARIFYING. THEM IN TERMS OF TRACE IS IT YOUR INTENTION BESIDES THE EXPANSION. ARM TO CONTINUE JUST THE PROGRAM AT LARGE WITH -- WITH A LARGER PROGRAM OR IS IT. WHAT WHAT ADDITIONAL ON RESOURCES AND NEEDS OR PLANS ARE THERE WITH THE PROGRAM? WELL WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE -- UNDERGROUND ECONOMIC CRIMES ARE GONNA DIFFER BY REGION -- BAY AREA CERTAINLY GONNA HAVE DIFFERENT FACTORS AND AND CRIMES AND PLAY THEN THEN FRESNO AND SO I THINK. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE SACRAMENTO IN LA TEAMS DIDN'T COVER THE ENTIRE STATE THEY DID. ON THEY WERE JUST KIND OF SPREAD THEN US. HAVING HEADQUARTERS IN THOSE DIFFERENT AREAS WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE AB PEOPLE. THAT CAN SPECIALIZE IN THAT LIKE BAY AREA YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF ISSUES INVOLVING THE POOR AND INNER MATH INTERNATIONAL MAIL CENTER -- THAT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU GET IN FRESNO AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAILOR ITSELF. TO THE REGION AND AND REALLY ACT AS A DETERRENT FOR SOME OF THE BIG MAJOR UNDERGROUND ECONOMIC CRIMES IN THAT AREA. GREAT THANK YOU ON DATA VERY MUCH APPRECIATE -- SENEGAL JOHNNY FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD ALL WANT ONE OF MY CONCERNS WITH THE TRACE PROGRAM AS IT WAS -- MOVING FORWARD WAS THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY IN COMPETITION WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S PROGRAM WHICH WAS RACE. IT'S ON GLAD THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO IT TO GET A CODIFIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WAS ON WITH SOME OF THE TENSION THAT WAS GOING ON SO. MOVING FORWARD I THINK IT WOULD BE ON GOOD TO FIGURE OUT HOW. THE PROGRAM IS GOING TO INTERFACE WITH THE AGENCIES THAT WERE PART OF RACE AND HOW THAT. ON HOW HOW ARE REALLY IS MORE OF A COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM THAT REALLY WASN'T MY IMPRESSION. LA I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A BUDGET REQUEST THIS YEAR. THAT I DIDN'T GET FUNDED BECAUSE OF I BELIEVE SOME OF THE CONCERNS REGARDING HOW COLLABORATIVE THIS PROGRAM IS IT IS CONCERNING THAT MYSTERIES HERE FROM CH P. AND THAT. ON THE HOPE IS THAT THE THE PROGRAM LEARNS FROM SOME OF THE HISTORYLARA'S TO WORK WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF AGENCIES ACROSS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. THAT THIS IS TOLD THAT NOTHING TO DO WITH AN UGLY THE SENATORS -- LEGISLATURE SOLUTION BUT I BELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE HAD INTENTION. WESTERN AGENCIES TO BE WORKED WITH -- I HOPE THAT THAT INTENTION WILL BE RESPECTED MOVING FORWARD EVEN THOUGH THE PROGRAM SUNSETS. ARE BECAUSE I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT HELP SOLVE THIS ISSUE REALLY BECOME INVOLVED RATHER THAN. ON PEOPLE JUST KIND OF GO IT ALONE. TIME CAN MAKE ONE COMMENT ON THAT SURE ON I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE CONVOLUTED HISTORY WITH THIS THE POLITICAL HISTORY AND WE HAVE AN ANNUAL REPORT. ON SECTION OF THE BILL THAT WHERE YOU WILL HAVE AN EXPLANATION THE MULTI AGENCY COLLABORATION -- AND ADJOURNMENTS. IT'S ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY'LL HAVE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OVER THROUGH THE CLARIFICATION. A ANY OTHER CAR A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. CENTER DE I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. AND YES I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE MOMENT TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED -- FAN THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ARM I'D A MAP WITH THEM AND I HAVE. ALSO MET WITH THE DOJ STAFF AND HAVE CONVEYED A DESIRE AND A WILLINGNESS. TO I'M TRYING TO WORK UP SOME LANGUAGE WHERE WE CAN AND DEFYING. PARTICIPATION FROM CHP AT THIS POINT WE HAVEN'T AGREED UPON ANYTHING BECAUSE OF THAT THE LATENESS AND TIME -- BUT CERTAINLY THE WILLINGNESS IS BARE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THE DOJ WISHES TO ENSURE THAT. THE TASK FORCE MAINTAINS ITS MEMBER LESSEN ITS FLEXIBILITY AND IT DOESN'T FIND ITSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE. EVERY AGENCY IS INVOLVED EVERY TYPE OF CASE AND SO I ANTICIPATE WORKING ON WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TO TRY TO REACH SOME MUTUALLY AGREEABLE LANGUAGE. ALMA OVER THE BREAK. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THANK YOU TO THE AGES OFFICE AND YOUR OFFICE I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF AMENDMENTS WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THIS WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS MAKING SURE THAT THAT CONFIDENTIAL TAX INFORMATION IS NOT OVER SHARED AND THAT THE AND THAT THE APPROPRIATE BODIES ARE ARE PARTICIPATING AND THAT. MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY WHO WAS PARTICIPATING SO THANK YOU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE CHP THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US TO MAKE SURE BOTH THE LEGISLATURE GETS A REPORT AND LIKE I SAID THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS ONLY SHARE WITH THOSE THAT IT IS APPROPRIATE TO BE SHARED WITH. WITHOUT -- SANDWICH MICHAEL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BURKE. BURKE AYE MATHIS MATHIS AYE CHIU GRAY. GRAY NOT VOTING MELINDA'S MULLIN QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE REAVIS.

HI KATHY VAN AUSTIN REPRESENTING AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION I'M HERE FOR MY PARTNER RAN MARTIN WHO COULDN'T BE HERE TODAY SO IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME I'M GONNA. REFER TO MY NOTES. BUT IN MY COMMITTEE ON ALL DAY YEAH. AND SO EIGHT AM EIGHT JOBS -- WHEN THEY STARTED PROVIDING SERVICES BACK IN -- NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THEY STARTED WITH HOUSING SERVICES -- AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY KNOW AS THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES IS THAT. ONE OF THE MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO PROVIDING HEALTHCARE SERVICES UP FOR THIS POPULATION IS HOUSING. AND WHO'S GOTTEN PARTICULAR FOR THE EXTREMELY LOW IN VERY LOW INCOME POPULATIONS. SO H. AFTER SPENT ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE PAST -- SEVERAL YEARS THEY'VE BEEN PUTTING -- ACQUIRING WE PER PERSON PROP. FOR THOSE WHO ARE -- VERY LOW INCOME OR OTHERWISE HOUSING CHALLENGE THAT THAT COULD BECOME HOMELESS. AND THIS BILL PROVIDES IT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TOOL. BECAUSE THAT TEN MILLION DOLLAR CAP REALLY DOES THEY'VE ALREADY EXCEEDED THAT ALLAH AND SO MAKES IT A VERY CHALLENGING TO PROVIDE THE THE HOUSING THAT THEY WANT IS TO PROVIDE AN THEY HAVE ACTUALLY RAISE MONEY TO PROVIDE. AND SO BY REMOVING THIS PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION -- SB ELEVEN FIFTEEN WILL HELP EIGHT H. OFF AS WELL AS OTHERS TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THIS. TARGETED POPULATION. THINK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU AND CHAIR THINKING MEMBERS THINK YOU LIVE IN A FILE I AM TO S. B. TWO SEVENTY FOUR SENATOR GLAZER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN [inaudible] WE MOVE THE BELL. CERI OF A MOTION AND A SECOND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WELL. I IT THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO UP PROVIDE CLARITY OF THE RULES. FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS ALL THE TO MY WITNESSES TO ENHANCE THAT BUT IT ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT IN. AS THEY WILL MAKE CLEAR SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS TO RESTORE MAY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION FIRST OF ALL WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK SENATOR GLACIER FOR CARRYING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL THIS BILL IS THE PROCESS BILL. THAT AUTHORIZES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO COLLECT UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP AUDIT RULES OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT CALIFORNIACOULD CONTINUE COLLECT AND THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF REVENUE LOSS. SECOND OF ALL THIS BILL HAS NO KNOWN OPPOSITION WE WORKED WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OVER AND OVER MONTHS AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING SOME OF THE ACCOUNTING FIRMS AND ALSO TAX ORGANIZATIONS. HAVE ALSO WORKED AND COME TO CONSENSUS LANGUAGE LAST BUT NOT LEAST -- THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE FRANCHISE TAX SPORTS WORKLOAD AS WELL AS REDUCE COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR TAXPAYERS AS A SIMPLE SET OF RULES THAT COULD APPLY IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD BE USED AS A MODEL STRUCTURE FOR OTHER STATES WOULD REDUCE THE COST THE TAXPAYERS WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE SIMILAR RULES ACROSS THE FORTY SIX STATES AS OPPOSED TO HAVING DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES. WE ARE CHIU AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THINK THE OTHER WITNESSES AS FOR FIVE MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NIKITA BAY WITH THE COUNCIL ON STATE TAXATION -- WE ARE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB UP -- TO SEVENTY FOUR COST HAS BEEN WORKING ON THIS BILL WITH SEVERAL OTHER NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS -- ON THIS ISSUE RATHER WITH SEVERAL OF SINCE THOSE INCLUDE THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION STATE AND LOCAL TAX COMMITTEE -- AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF THE CA PA'S INSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONALS AND TAXATION TAX EXECUTIVES INSTITUTE AND THE MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ASSOCIATION. OF THESE GROUPS HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING WITH THE MULTI STATE TAX COMMISSION ON A MODEL. STATUTE TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE -- THIS -- IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR COST BECAUSE THE REPORTING OF FEDERAL CHANGES IS A VERY DIFFICULT TASK FOR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL TAXPAYERS -- IT REQUIRES FOLLOWING A FEDERAL AUDIT. TAXPAYERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT THOSE CHANGES TO THE STATE'S THIS IS VERY CHALLENGING AND TIME CONSUMING. A SIGNIFICANT COMPLIANCE BURDEN FOR MULTI JURISDICTIONAL TAXPAYERS -- THE REASON COST HAS BEEN WORKING SO LONG AND HARD OVERTWO YEARS WITH ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ON A MODEL IS THAT IT'S IT -- IF WE HAVE A MODEL LANGUAGE. IT DECREASES THE CLIENTS THE COMPLIANCE BURDEN AND ACTUALLY INCREASES ACCURACY AND THE TIME IN WHICH IT TAKES REPORT THOSE CHANGES -- THEREFORE COST SUPPORTS SP TWO SEVENTY FOUR BECAUSE INCORPORATES MANY OF THE CONCEPTS IN THE MODEL THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED AND WE BELIEVE THAT IT WILL HELP ACHIEVE UNIFORMITY AND IMPROVE COMPLIANCE THANK YOU. JEFF SERIES ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS ASSOCIATION THIS IS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIPS AND WE JUST WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD ON THE OTHER PROPONENTS. FOR RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUENESS OF THE PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIP IN IDENTIFYING SOME LANGUAGE IN THE BALL THE ALLOWS IT TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME GOALS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
