00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:10.467
ABOUT THE VERBIAGE THAT IS

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:11.168
BEING USED TO MAYBE IT'S

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.136
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WORKED ON

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:13.838
INTRODUCED MAYBE I'M NOT

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.039
READING IT CORRECTLY BUT IT

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:17.775
APPEARS THAT IT IT. FORCES

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:19.944
MEDIATION AND EVERY STANDPOINT

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.212
WHEN MY UNDERSTANDING THE DEAL

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:24.782
THAT WE MADE IT WAS THAT THE-

00:41:24.849 --> 00:41:26.317
EMPLOYER COULD REQUEST

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:28.118
MEDIATION BUT THE LANGUAGE OF

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.854
THIS BILL REALLY DOES PUT

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.523
PEOPLE IN A BIND WHERE THE-

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.825
EMPLOYER DOES NOT WANT TO-

00:41:34.892 --> 00:41:35.826
ENGAGE IN MEDIATION FOR

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:38.028
WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY WENT

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:39.396
THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO

00:41:39.463 --> 00:41:43.033
THEIR- TO THEIR MALE MAYBE.

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.568
THEY'RE THEY'RE JERKS AND ARE

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:45.502
JUST LIKE I DON'T CARE SEE IN

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:48.272
COURT RIGHT BUT I THINK IT'S IT

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:50.040
MIGHT BE A DISTINCTION WITHOUT

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:52.176
A DIFFERENCE FOR MOST CASES

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.211
RIGHT WOULD GO TO MEDIATION BUT

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:56.113
IT IT SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.415
MEDIATION IT IS UPON US THE

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:01.919
REQUEST OF THE EMPLOYER. DOES

00:42:01.986 --> 00:42:02.887
THAT MAKE SENSE. I THINK

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:04.622
THERE'S- WERE EMPLOYER I THINK

00:42:04.688 --> 00:42:08.158
WHAT WE THAT THE MEDIATION. HAS

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:09.994
TO BE ALLOWED UPON REQUEST OF

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:11.862
THE EMPLOYER BUT IT IS NOT

00:42:11.929 --> 00:42:13.764
REQUIRED PER OUR DISCUSSIONS AT

00:42:13.831 --> 00:42:15.566
LEAST MEDIATION ITSELF WAS NOT

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:17.368
REQUIRED BEFORE FILING A

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:19.737
LAWSUIT THE EMPLOYER JUST HAD

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:21.672
TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:22.273
MEDIATION BEFORE A LAWSUIT WAS

00:42:22.339 --> 00:42:24.475
FILED. SO I WOULD LOVE TO

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.242
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:26.510
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M

00:42:26.577 --> 00:42:27.311
FULLY GRASPING WHAT YOU'RE

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.313
SAYING BUT I. THINK IT'S- I

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.248

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:35.653
CONVERSATIONS MAYBE THAT'S PART

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:37.922
OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS- I THINK

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:40.057
MY- RECOLLECTION WAS WE WANT TO

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.091

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:51.302
EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:52.836
AS WELL WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.004
EXPRESS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S-

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:54.571
PART OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:55.806

00:43:04.915 --> 00:43:06.850
TEXAS SUGGEST THAT MEDIATION IS

00:43:06.917 --> 00:43:09.687
ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BEFORE- A

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:11.588
LAWSUIT WHEN IT DOESN'T IT

00:43:11.655 --> 00:43:12.690
DOESN'T ADDRESS A POINT WHERE

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.791
YOU MIGHT HAVE AN EMPLOYER AND

00:43:13.857 --> 00:43:15.125

LANGUAGE THAT GOT US TO WHERE I

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.572
THINK WE WERE LAST YEAR AGAIN

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:29.606

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:40.617
THE BILL LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:41.251
PART OF WHY WE PUT THE TIMELINE

IMMEDIATELY THAT IT'S GOING TO

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.442
BE FOR LESS THAN OF A GRAVE AND

00:44:05.509 --> 00:44:06.210
NOBODY GOES TO MEDIATION THE

00:44:06.276 --> 00:44:08.012

ABOUT A CHILD CARE BECAUSE THE

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:21.869
BIG THE BIG ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:23.838
A COMMUNITIES AS YOU SPOKE

FINANCIALLY AND- AND IT. UP IT

01:27:32.046 --> 01:27:34.782
OVERLY IMPACTS SOME ARE

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:36.150
MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND- THE

01:27:36.217 --> 01:27:41.422
FOLKS THERE. MY QUESTION IS WHY.

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:43.157
YOU KNOW L. IS WE KIND OF

01:27:43.224 --> 01:27:45.159
BERMAN MORE AND MORE ON TO

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.694
THESE CORPORATIONS COMPANIES

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.229
THAT SET FOR THE EMPLOYERS OF

01:27:48.296 --> 01:27:50.398
THESE. WHY ISN'T THERE A

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:53.434
CEILING ON ON WHO GETS THIS

01:27:53.501 --> 01:27:57.505
BENEFIT BECAUSE- THAT COST-

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.140
ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:02.310
THAT HIGHER WAGE EMPLOYEES-

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:04.445
NEED TO HELP OFFSET AND IT

01:28:04.512 --> 01:28:06.714
SEEMS LIKE. A LIKE A LOT OF THE

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:11.552
PROGRAMS WE DEVELOP- IT'S- A

01:28:11.619 --> 01:28:12.887
LOT OF MONEY IS GOING TO PEOPLE

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.222
WHO DON'T NEED IT WELL THE

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:15.189
PEOPLE THAT DO NEED IT DON'T

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:18.059
GET ENOUGH. AND THAT'S MY

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.994
CONCERN IS THAT WE KEEP MAKING

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.930
THESE PROGRAMMES. THAT THAT.

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:26.000
DIDN'T BENEFIT. OF THE DONATED

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:27.602
OR HAVE THEIR ALLOW THEM TO

01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:28.736
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A PROGRAM

01:28:28.803 --> 01:28:31.005
THAT THEY JUST DON'T NEED. AND

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:32.974
YET YOU KNOW IF IT'S THERE THEY

01:28:33.041 --> 01:28:36.310
TAKE IT. AND THAT REDUCES THE

01:28:36.377 --> 01:28:38.513
ABILITY OF US TO ASSIST PEOPLE

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:41.015
THAT ARE TRULY IN NEED. SO WHY

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:42.984
WHY WAS THAT NOT CONSIDERED IN

01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:45.353
THIS BILL. THANKS FOR THE

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.655
QUESTION- YOU MENTIONED WHAT IS

01:28:47.722 --> 01:28:49.123
THE CEILING THE CEILING OF THE

01:28:49.190 --> 01:28:50.958
GLASS CEILING IT'S A FEELING

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.460
THAT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.395
MOTHERS AND PARTICULARLY

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:56.764
REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WORK.

01:28:56.831 --> 01:28:57.965
REGARDLESS OF MUCH MONEY THEY

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:59.600
MAKE AND I'M GLAD THAT THE

01:28:59.667 --> 01:29:01.102
CHAMBER POINTED THIS OUT AS

01:29:01.169 --> 01:29:03.438
WELL IN TERMS OF. LOW WAGE

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:04.939
WORKERS AND HIGH INCOME WAGE

01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:06.641
WORKERS MOTHERS DON'T GET AN

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:07.842
OPPORTUNITY TO STAY I'M GOING

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:09.043
TO GO TO WORK TODAY OR I'M

01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.744
GOING TO BE A CHILD CARE

01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:11.646
PROVIDER TODAY OR I'M GONNA YOU

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:13.815
KNOW BE THE SOLE EARNER. IN MY

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.783
FAMILY THERE IS NO CHOICE

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:17.618
MOTHERS DO ALL OF THAT I WOULD

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:20.288
SAY THAT PARENTS DO ALL OF THAT

01:29:20.354 --> 01:29:22.390
SO THERE ARE CORPORATIONS

01:29:22.457 --> 01:29:24.425
ALREADY OFFERING THIS BENEFIT

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:26.694
LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK. WHO

01:29:26.761 --> 01:29:28.763
WORKS THERE. RIGHT IT'S MOSTLY

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:32.233
ENGINEERS. OF HIGH WAGE EARNERS

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.735
THAT ALREADY HAVE THIS BENEFIT

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.570
AND IT'S NOT A BENEFIT. THAT IS

01:29:35.636 --> 01:29:38.172
THE FIRST PRIORITY TO YOU THE

01:29:38.239 --> 01:29:39.941
BACKUP CHILD CARE. HOW THE

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.743
BENEFIT IN CASE YOU NEED IT.

01:29:41.809 --> 01:29:43.144
NOT THE ONE THING THAT YOU'RE

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:44.879
GOING TO SOLELY USE. I WORKED

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.514
ON LEGISLATION IN THE PAST

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.015
WE'VE ADDED FIFTY MILLION

01:29:48.082 --> 01:29:49.016
DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO AFTER

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:52.019
SCHOOL FUNDING. HUGE DEAL IN

01:29:52.086 --> 01:29:53.154
TERMS OF ENSURING THAT.

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:54.789
CHILDREN IN LOW INCOME AREAS

01:29:54.856 --> 01:29:56.157
PARTICULARLY LIKE AND

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.292
COMMUNITIES THAT I SERVE HAVE A

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:00.294
SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY COULD BE.

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:01.529
I WANT PARENTS ARE WORKING SO

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.431
THAT THERE. ARE BEING EDUCATED

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:04.499
THAT THEY HAVE RESOURCES AND

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.400
PROGRAMS BUT EVERY YEAR WE

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:09.604
CONTINUOUSLY. CUT FUNDING OR

01:30:09.670 --> 01:30:11.439
DON'T HAVE AS MUCH RESOURCES TO

01:30:11.506 --> 01:30:12.974
OTHER PARTICULAR AREAS OF CHILD

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:15.676
KERR THERE IS A HUGE INTENT AND

01:30:15.743 --> 01:30:16.878
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF THINGS

01:30:16.944 --> 01:30:19.280
PASSED IN TERMS OF. EARLY CHILD

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:21.482
CARE. AFTER SCHOOL CARE. BUT A

01:30:21.549 --> 01:30:23.217
BACKUP CHILD CARE PROVIDED BY

01:30:23.284 --> 01:30:25.253
YOUR EMPLOYER IS QUITE

01:30:25.319 --> 01:30:27.755
DIFFERENT. AND IN FACT WE HAVE

01:30:27.822 --> 01:30:29.724
DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. AN

01:30:29.791 --> 01:30:33.327
EMPLOYER WHO OFFERS SUPPORT FOR

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.596
CHILDCARE. ABSENCES AT THAT

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:38.099
COMPANY DECREASED BY 2230% AND

01:30:38.166 --> 01:30:39.834
TURNOVER DROPPED BY THIRTY

01:30:39.901 --> 01:30:40.868
SEVEN OF 60% THAT IS ACTUALLY A

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:42.804
BENEFIT. FOR CORPORATIONS SO

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.572
THAT THERE'S LESS TURNOVER LESS

01:30:44.639 --> 01:30:46.374
MONEY SPENT ON TRAINING. AND

01:30:46.440 --> 01:30:48.042
LESS MONEY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.609
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER

01:30:48.676 --> 01:30:50.578
POSITION. SO IF WHAT I'M

01:30:50.645 --> 01:30:51.979
HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT YOU

01:30:52.046 --> 01:30:53.014
BELIEVE THAT A PROGRAM LIKE

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:55.249
THIS IS BENEFICIAL TO LOW

01:30:55.316 --> 01:30:58.486
INCOME OR LOW WAGE WORKERS I'M

WITH YOU. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:01.289
IT FLEXIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:31:01.355 --> 01:31:02.924
PARENT EVERY SINGLE MOTHER

01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:04.592
ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S THE

01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:08.429
INTENT RIGHT SIR IS A- PERSON

01:31:08.496 --> 01:31:09.463
WHO ACTUALLY GREW UP WITH THE

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:13.034
DAD- WITH THE ONES WITH THE DAD.

01:31:13.100 --> 01:31:15.837
AND OUR MOM MOM MOM MOM PASSED

01:31:15.903 --> 01:31:19.707
AWAY SO- DADS HAD THAT SAME

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:20.641
ISSUE AND YOU KNOW HE DID

01:31:20.708 --> 01:31:23.611
MANAGE. BUT ALSO- WHAT I WANTED

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:24.545
TO THAT POINT OUT WAS THE

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.547
GOOGLES. AND THE FACEBOOKS AND

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.149
BIG COMPANIES YOU MENTIONED

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.117
THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT AND

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:32.420
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO HELP.

01:31:32.486 --> 01:31:33.187
BUILD THE WORKFORCE THAT THEY

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.923
WANT- SOME CORPORATE SOME

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.391
COMPANIES CAN'T AFFORD TO DO

01:31:37.458 --> 01:31:39.126
THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:31:39.193 --> 01:31:42.730
FORCING THEM TO. GO INTO THAT

01:31:42.797 --> 01:31:46.901
WORLD AND COMPETE AND FROM A-

01:31:46.968 --> 01:31:49.036
ATTRACTIONS STANDPOINT. FOR

01:31:49.103 --> 01:31:51.472
AREAS LIKE THE AREA I LIVE IN

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:54.108
WE NEED MORE MANUFACTURING WE

01:31:54.175 --> 01:31:56.344
NEED MORE BUSINESSES TO COME IN

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:57.178
SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE OFF

01:31:57.245 --> 01:32:00.648
OF THE COMMUTE. AND STOP IN

01:32:00.715 --> 01:32:02.183
WHICH HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:32:02.250 --> 01:32:03.851
YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

01:32:03.918 --> 01:32:05.219
BUSINESS RETENTION IT'S ABOUT

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:07.588
BUSINESS ATTRACTION AND THE

01:32:07.655 --> 01:32:09.790
MORE OF THESE TYPE OF- IN

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:12.093
POSITIONS ON THESE COMPANIES

01:32:12.159 --> 01:32:14.128
THAT WE PUT IN. THE THAT MORE

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.529
DIFFICULT THE ENVIRONMENT IS

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:18.099
FOR THEM TO OPERATE. THE LESS

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:20.368
WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANIES AND

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.869
THAT MEANS LESS JOBS AND THAT

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:22.737
MEANS THOSE GLASS CEILINGS

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:24.205
DON'T GET BROKEN BECAUSE THOSE

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:26.707
PEOPLE AREN'T WORKING. SO SO

01:32:26.774 --> 01:32:28.175
THAT'S MY CONCERN YOU KNOW I

01:32:28.242 --> 01:32:30.211
GET I SEE THE CUMULATIVE

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:32.313
EFFECTS THAT THIS IS HAVING ON.

01:32:32.380 --> 01:32:34.815
ON ON THESE COMPANIES THAT WE

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:37.518
WANT TO HAVE HERE. AND THEY'RE

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:40.054
NOT COMING HERE. AND BECAUSE

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:40.688
IT'S NOT A CHOICE NOW OF MOVING

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:43.324
OUT. BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE

01:32:43.391 --> 01:32:43.958
CHOICE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.893
HERE FOR SO LONG AND NOW THEY

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:47.695
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHILE WE DO

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.597
BUSINESS HERE ANYMORE. THAT'S A

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.432
HUGE UNDERTAKING THE FOR

01:32:51.499 --> 01:32:52.767
SOMEBODY WHO'S CONSIDERING

01:32:52.833 --> 01:32:55.369
DOING MANUFACTURING HERE- NUYS

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:57.271
WILL DO IN ARIZONA AND THAT'S

01:32:57.338 --> 01:32:59.273
WHAT WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST.

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.341
AND THAT'S WHAT'S HURTING AREAS

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.475
LIKE OURS AND THAT'S WHAT'S

01:33:01.542 --> 01:33:03.311
HELPING. CREATE MORE POLLUTION

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.513

01:33:20.828 --> 01:33:22.296
ALSO IS BENEFICIAL TO PARENTS

01:33:22.363 --> 01:33:25.533
TO OPT INTO MOMS TO DADS- IN AN

01:33:25.599 --> 01:33:27.902

DIFFERENT IT'S A NEW APPROACH-

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:16.150
I THINK YOU KNOW I WAS A SINGLE

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.685
MOM FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND I

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:18.886
WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOTHER.

01:34:18.953 --> 01:34:21.789
AND I. THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.758
SITUATIONS WERE OFTEN CAUSED BY

01:34:23.824 --> 01:34:26.193
WORK. YOU KNOW AND I WAS LUCKY

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.762
ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DRAG MY

01:34:27.828 --> 01:34:30.431
KIDS. BACK TO WORK WITH ME WHEN

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:33.801
I HAD TO GO. IN AND GO IN FOR

01:34:33.868 --> 01:34:35.302
WHATEVER REASON BUT NOT ALL

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:36.437
WORKERS HAVE GOTTEN SO I'D

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.773
REALLY ARGUE THOUGH TOO. RIGHT

01:34:38.839 --> 01:34:40.274
NOW WHILE WE'RE SEEING ALL

01:34:40.341 --> 01:34:42.276
THESE STORIES ABOUT HOW HARD IT

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.546
IS TO GET WORKERS TO COME BACK.

01:34:45.613 --> 01:34:46.714
THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:48.416
HERE YES YOU CAN MOVE SOMETHING

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:49.717
THE ARIZONA DOESN'T MATTER IF

01:34:49.784 --> 01:34:50.851
YOU DON'T PAY ENOUGH AND

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.153
PROVIDE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:53.621
ACTUALLY WANT THAT JOB WE'RE

01:34:53.687 --> 01:34:55.689
STARTING TO SEE THAT FOR. WAY

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:58.459
TOO LONG- THE UNITED STATES HAS

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.895
HAS RELIED ON- LARGELY

01:35:00.961 --> 01:35:03.164
UNPROTECTED IMMIGRANT WORKERS

01:35:03.230 --> 01:35:04.165
TO PICK UP THE SLACK AT THE

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:06.400
BOTTOM. AND WITH THE CHANGES

01:35:06.467 --> 01:35:07.401
THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND WHAT

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:08.869
WE'RE SEEING NOW IT'S ONLY YOU

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:11.038
KNOW IT IT IT'S BECOMING CLEAR

01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.573
THAT OUR WORK FORCE RULES

01:35:12.640 --> 01:35:14.842
NATIONALLY DO NOT WORK. FOR

01:35:14.909 --> 01:35:18.245
WORKING PARENTS. SO I WANT TO

01:35:18.312 --> 01:35:20.114
THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF.

01:35:20.181 --> 01:35:21.215
THEY'RE THERE ARE THINGS I

01:35:21.282 --> 01:35:22.716
THINK WE CAN WORK ON IN THIS

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:24.251
TICKET TO STRENGTHEN AND TO

01:35:24.318 --> 01:35:26.554
MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE THAT- AND

01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.389
I DO THINK. WE HAVE TO MAKE

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.857
SURE IT IS BACK UP CHILD CARE

01:35:29.924 --> 01:35:31.325
IT'S NOT JUST THE FOR SIXTY

01:35:31.392 --> 01:35:32.493
HOURS I UNDERSTAND I THINK WE

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.527
CAN WORK ON THAT AND THIS IS A

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:35.596
NEW APPROACH TO IT THOUGH AND I

01:35:35.663 --> 01:35:37.231
APPRECIATE THAT. WE DON'T TALK

01:35:37.298 --> 01:35:39.700
ABOUT CHILD CARE ENOUGH- AS A

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.168
BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT AT ONE OF

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:42.303
THE REASONS WOMEN DROPPED OUT

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:43.337
OF THE WORKFORCE WAS BECAUSE OF

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:45.039
OUR CHILD CARE ISSUES SO. I

01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:46.707
JUST I COMMEND YOU FOR DOING

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:47.942
THIS HARD WORK IN FOR STARTING

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:50.111
A CONVERSATION THAT. IF IT'S

01:35:50.177 --> 01:35:52.379
NOT JUST CALIFORNIA OUR ENTIRE

01:35:52.446 --> 01:35:53.547
COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE THIS

01:35:53.614 --> 01:35:55.182
CONVERSATION AND WE KNOW IT

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:56.317
DOESN'T START FROM WASHINGTON

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:57.918
IT NEVER DOES ALL OF THESE

01:35:57.985 --> 01:36:00.688
IDEAS START CALIFORNIAN SO I'M

01:36:00.754 --> 01:36:01.288
GLAD YOU'RE STARTING. LOOKING

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:04.358
MOTION. THAT MOTION. IS THEIR-

01:36:04.425 --> 01:36:07.862
SEGMENT. UP BY SHIP. YEAH YOU

01:36:07.928 --> 01:36:09.296
JERRY THANK YOU- CALLING FOR

01:36:09.363 --> 01:36:10.631
BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I DO

01:36:10.698 --> 01:36:12.900
SHARE MY- COLLEAGUE A SUPPORT

01:36:12.967 --> 01:36:16.036
OF OBVIOUSLY CHILD CARE- BUT

01:36:16.103 --> 01:36:16.637
NOT ALL INDUSTRIES ARE CREATED

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:20.474
EQUAL. AND WITH I'VE SAID THIS

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:21.976
MANY TIMESIN THIS COMMITTEE

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:24.011
WHEN WE PAINT IN THESE BROAD

01:36:24.078 --> 01:36:25.980
BRUSHES AND THERE ARE NO. WE

01:36:26.046 --> 01:36:27.014
COME FROM BUT THAT WAS IN

01:36:27.081 --> 01:36:30.151
MANUFACTURING OKAY- IF THERE IS

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:32.286
A ISSUE WITH A PRESS BRAKE

01:36:32.353 --> 01:36:34.989
OPERATOR. IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN

01:36:35.055 --> 01:36:35.656
JUST PULL SOMEBODY OFF THE

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:38.926
STREET. TO REPLACE THAT RIGHT I

01:36:38.993 --> 01:36:40.394
UNDERSTAND THE CHILD CARE IS A

01:36:40.461 --> 01:36:42.763
HUGE HUGE PROBLEM AND WE NEED

01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:44.765
TO DEAL WITH THIS. BUT TO PUT

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:48.702
THESE KIND OF- ONEROUS.

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:50.371
MANDATES QUITE FRANKLY ON THE

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.506
BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I DO I

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:53.274
HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS

01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:55.075
LIKE. AT SOME POINT I'LL GO

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:57.378
THROUGH THEM- OF WHAT JUST LIKE

01:36:57.444 --> 01:37:00.114
THIS COMMITTEE JUST TODAY WHAT

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:00.648
WE'RE GOING TO DO TO THE

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:02.716
BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS

01:37:02.783 --> 01:37:03.717
JUST ONE MORE OF THOSE THINGS

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:04.885
THAT I THINK THE INTENTIONS ARE

01:37:04.952 --> 01:37:06.587
GOOD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU I

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.189
RESPECT YOU. BUT WE HAVE THIS

01:37:08.255 --> 01:37:12.593
WEIRD IDEA THAT THE BUSINESS

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:14.962
COMMUNITY IS OUT THERE JUST.

01:37:15.029 --> 01:37:15.529
RANDOMLY HURTING PEOPLE THEY

01:37:15.596 --> 01:37:17.531
DON'T CARE. AND IT'S

01:37:17.598 --> 01:37:19.133
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN A IN A

01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:20.668
AND I'M STARTING TO REALLY SEE

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:23.137
A PATTERN HERE WHERE EVERYTHING

01:37:23.204 --> 01:37:25.406
THAT WE DO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE

01:37:25.472 --> 01:37:26.740
EMPLOYEE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:29.977
TO BE SHORT. BUT THERE IS ALSO

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:31.178
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:33.314
BUSINESSES AND MO THERE'S AN

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:34.515
ARGUMENT BECAUSE OF THE STATE

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:35.382
BUDGET THAT PEOPLE AREN'T

01:37:35.449 --> 01:37:36.984
LEAVING. BASED ON CERTAIN

01:37:37.051 --> 01:37:38.886
SECTORS OUR BUDGET IS KIND OF

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:41.288
REBOUNDED. THE MY CENTRAL

01:37:41.355 --> 01:37:43.123
VALLEY IS GETTING DECIMATED

01:37:43.190 --> 01:37:44.325
OVER THESE ISSUES THE LOCAL

01:37:44.391 --> 01:37:46.160
COMMUNITIES THAT THE FARM WHERE

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:47.761
EVERYONE AT THE FARM LABORERS.

01:37:47.828 --> 01:37:49.063
IT'S MORE THE MANUFACTURING

01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:51.031
SIDE THAT I HAVE A REALLY MAJOR

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:52.166
CONCERN BECAUSE THAT IS A

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:54.635
SKILLED POSITION. AND IF WE

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:57.838
JUST GIVE THEM. CHILD CARE IN

01:37:57.905 --> 01:37:59.440
THE IN THIS IN THIS BILL LIKE

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.342
THEY ONLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT

01:38:01.408 --> 01:38:03.210
THE CHILD CARE WASN'T AVAILABLE.

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.745
IT'S JUST ASSUMED. THAT THE

01:38:04.812 --> 01:38:07.848
BEING TRUTHFUL. WHERE CAN

01:38:07.915 --> 01:38:10.818
ACTUALLY ASK THAT. I THINK

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:11.919
THAT'S KIND OF A PROBLEM SO I

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.487
THINK IS AS MUCH AS WE CARE

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:15.756
ABOUT OUR KIDS. WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:38:15.823 --> 01:38:17.391
A HARD LOOK AT OUR EMPLOYERS AS

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.627
WELL BECAUSE THEY TOO DESERVE A

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.495
SEAT AT THE TABLE AND I AM AM.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.831
VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:38:23.897 --> 01:38:24.465
DIRECTION OF SOME OF THE THINGS

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:27.167
WE'RE GOING. IN SHAKEN NOT

01:38:27.234 --> 01:38:31.438
STIRRED I THINK YOU'VE GOT MORE

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:35.709
THAN. MMHM I'LL BE BEING WANTED

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:36.243

I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:38:43.817 --> 01:38:45.152
QUESTION I THINK THE QUOTED

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:46.920
CRISIS HAS EXPOSED A LOT OF

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:49.356
GAPS. IN OUR SOCIETY FRANKLY I

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:50.658
THINK CHILD CARE CERTAINLY IS

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.793
ONE OF AMON SILICON VALLEY WHAT

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:54.828
A HIGH AGE WORKERS EARNERS HIGH

01:38:54.895 --> 01:38:56.397
WAGE EARNERS THAT ALSO ARE

01:38:56.463 --> 01:38:58.666
HAVING ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO

01:38:58.732 --> 01:39:01.435
CHILD CARE AND- IN OCTOBER AND

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.936
I RESPECT THEM THE THOUGHTS

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.705
YOUR VICE CHAIR. TALKING ABOUT

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:05.739
HOW TO PULL ACROSS THE LINE BUT

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:07.041
THERE'S NOT A CHANCE THAT THEY

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:08.575
WILL HAVE TO PULL THEM ACROSS

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:09.376
THE LINE BECAUSE IT'LL JUST ON

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.312
THE JOB. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:13.080
COSTS AND ALL THAT THE THAT THE

01:39:13.147 --> 01:39:14.648
CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:15.349
BY THE OPPOSITION IN THAT

01:39:15.416 --> 01:39:18.218
REGARD. HOW IT IS NOT JUST.

01:39:18.285 --> 01:39:20.521
ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF JOBS ALSO

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.890
THE QUALITY OF LIFE PROVIDED BY

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:24.258
THE JOBS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND

01:39:24.325 --> 01:39:26.627
SO THA IS A CONSTANT

01:39:26.694 --> 01:39:28.329
CONVERSATION HERE IN THIS

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:29.063
BUILDING I KNOW THERE'S

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.464
CONSTANTLY BILLS GOING FORWARD

01:39:30.531 --> 01:39:32.066

FIGURE OUT. HOW TO WALK

01:39:35.069 --> 01:39:36.937
OUTLINED HOW TO BALANCE BUT

01:39:37.004 --> 01:39:37.905
MAKE SURE AT THE END F THE

01:39:37.971 --> 01:39:40.441
DAY. BUT IF PEOPLE IF IT'S A

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:41.508
RACE TO THE BOTTOM IS THE

01:39:41.575 --> 01:39:42.976
WORKERS GOT CRUSHED IN THAT

01:39:43.043 --> 01:39:44.878
REACHED THE BOTTOM AND SELF HOW

DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:48.349

ECONOMY HOPEFULLY CONTINUES

01:39:50.884 --> 01:39:53.887

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:09.393
FIRST QUESTION IS- ARE THESE.

02:36:09.460 --> 02:36:11.295
THE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE HOW

02:36:11.361 --> 02:36:14.565

IT'S A RETENTION ISSUE AND

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:22.206
THERE IS A- A THREAT OR A REAL

02:36:22.272 --> 02:36:24.541
REALITY THAT. WE MIGHT BE-

02:36:24.608 --> 02:36:26.143
REALLY LOSING SO MUCH OF OUR

COLLAPSE- I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT

02:36:32.516 --> 02:36:33.784
THAT'S- ALSO A PLACE THAT MAYBE

02:36:33.851 --> 02:36:35.619
THESE CONVERSATIONS. SHOULD BE

02:36:35.686 --> 02:36:39.857
TAKING PLACE- ARE. IS NOT GOING

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:40.991

AN APPRECIATION PAYMENT. AND I

02:47:31.074 --> 02:47:31.708
DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE

02:47:31.775 --> 02:47:34.544
APPRECIATION PAYMENT APPROACH.

02:47:34.611 --> 02:47:36.880
BUT WHAT I DISAGREE WITH IS IF

02:47:36.946 --> 02:47:38.715
I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:47:38.782 --> 02:47:42.152
WARDS- DEDICATION TO HIS JOB

02:47:42.218 --> 02:47:44.587
HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. I AND I

02:47:44.654 --> 02:47:46.389
WANT TO I WANT HIM TO HAVE A

02:47:46.456 --> 02:47:47.557
THOUSAND DOLLARS I'M NOT GONNA

02:47:47.624 --> 02:47:48.992
TELL YOU TO GIVEN THE THOUSAND

02:47:49.058 --> 02:47:50.760
DOLLARS AND THEN SHAKE HIS HAND

02:47:50.827 --> 02:47:53.897
SAY HEY YOU'RE WELCOME. NOW IF

02:47:53.963 --> 02:47:57.300
WE WANT TO TRULY. RECOGNIZE THE

02:47:57.367 --> 02:47:59.402
JOB THAT THESE PEOPLE DID. THEN

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:00.837
WE NEED TO ADD UP WHAT THE COST

02:48:00.904 --> 02:48:02.305
IS. TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY

02:48:02.372 --> 02:48:04.040
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

02:48:04.107 --> 02:48:07.877
SENT US THE STATE. AND AND SEND

02:48:07.944 --> 02:48:09.379
OUT THOSE CHECKS JUST LIKE THEY

02:48:09.446 --> 02:48:12.148
SEND OUT THE CHECKS FOR- YOU

02:48:12.215 --> 02:48:14.751
KNOW THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS-

02:48:14.818 --> 02:48:15.952
THAT WOULD COVER ALL OF THE

02:48:16.019 --> 02:48:17.954
HEALTHCARE WORKERS. WE WOULD

02:48:18.021 --> 02:48:19.355
KNOW WHAT THE COST IS GOING

02:48:19.422 --> 02:48:20.590
FORWARD BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF

02:48:20.657 --> 02:48:21.758
MY OTHER QUESTIONS DO YOU KNOW

02:48:21.825 --> 02:48:23.860
WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST IS FOR

02:48:23.927 --> 02:48:25.662
THIS FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRY. I

02:48:25.728 --> 02:48:29.566
KNOW I'VE SEEN NOW. ESTIMATES

02:48:29.632 --> 02:48:31.234
BUT I DON'T HAVE IT OFF HAND

02:48:31.301 --> 02:48:33.069
OKAY THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT

02:48:33.136 --> 02:48:35.305
WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED TO GET

02:48:35.371 --> 02:48:35.872
THE EXACT FIGURES BUT IT'S A

02:48:35.939 --> 02:48:39.042
LOT- IF WE CAN ABSORB THAT COST

02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:40.710
IS AN ASSEMBLY. AS THE SENATE

02:48:40.777 --> 02:48:42.545
IS THE LEGISLATURE THEN WE

02:48:42.612 --> 02:48:43.680
SHOULD SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE

02:48:43.746 --> 02:48:44.948
CAN DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO

02:48:45.014 --> 02:48:46.716
REWARD THOSE VOTES FOR THE ALL

02:48:46.783 --> 02:48:48.651
THE GREAT. GREAT WORK THEY DID.

02:48:48.718 --> 02:48:50.153
AND BY THE WAY THEIR WORK

02:48:50.220 --> 02:48:51.921
EXTENDS BEYOND CODE. THEIR WORK

02:48:51.988 --> 02:48:53.756
IT STANDS IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN

02:48:53.823 --> 02:48:57.727
IN A BEES BUSY ER- THERE'S

02:48:57.794 --> 02:48:58.361
HEROIC ACTIONS GOING IN ALL THE

02:48:58.428 --> 02:48:59.963
TIME- THE HEALTH CARE

02:49:00.029 --> 02:49:03.032
PROVIDERS. I REALIZE THAT THEY

02:49:03.099 --> 02:49:04.934
GOT SOME SAID THEY GOT MONEY.

02:49:05.001 --> 02:49:07.170
TO HELP RECOVER. AND KEEP THEM

02:49:07.237 --> 02:49:09.672
ALIVE. BECAUSE DURING THE

02:49:09.739 --> 02:49:10.974
PANDEMIC AND THIS IS SOMETHING

02:49:11.040 --> 02:49:12.642
I LEARNED BY TALKING TO THE

02:49:12.709 --> 02:49:14.444
CEOS OF THE HOSPITALS. BECAUSE

02:49:14.511 --> 02:49:15.712
I THOUGHT WELL YOU GUYS WERE

02:49:15.778 --> 02:49:17.247
PROBABLY THE ONLY ONES DOING

02:49:17.313 --> 02:49:18.948
OKAY YOU'RE IN BUSINESS. THEY

02:49:19.015 --> 02:49:20.416
SAID ACTUALLY NO IN FACT WE'VE

02:49:20.483 --> 02:49:22.018
LAID OFF HALF OUR STAFF.

02:49:22.085 --> 02:49:23.186
BECAUSE THE REST OF THE

02:49:23.253 --> 02:49:26.089
HOSPITAL OUTSIDE OF THE ER WAS

02:49:26.155 --> 02:49:28.324
NOT FUNCTIONING. SO THEY DID

02:49:28.391 --> 02:49:29.359
LOSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:31.394
MONEY. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

02:49:31.461 --> 02:49:32.695
THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU

02:49:32.762 --> 02:49:35.331
KNOW I. THESE BILLS ARE HARD

02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:36.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN ON ONE HAND

02:49:36.900 --> 02:49:38.301
WE'RE TRYING TO REWARD PEOPLE

02:49:38.368 --> 02:49:40.236
FOR DOING THIS AWESOME JOB. AND

02:49:40.303 --> 02:49:42.005
RECOGNIZE THEM FOR THAT AND WE

02:49:42.071 --> 02:49:44.107
HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RECOGNIZE

02:49:44.173 --> 02:49:47.110
THESE THESE VALIANT WORKERS-

02:49:47.176 --> 02:49:49.145
THROUGHOUT THIS THING. BUT I

02:49:49.212 --> 02:49:50.446
THINK IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH I

02:49:50.513 --> 02:49:51.881
THINK THE APPROACH WE NEED TO

02:49:51.948 --> 02:49:52.916
TAKE IT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE

02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:55.151
COST IS. MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:49:55.218 --> 02:49:56.653
THOSE FOLKS AND IF WE'RE GONNA

02:49:56.719 --> 02:49:59.022
GIVE THEM A REWARD THEN WE

02:49:59.088 --> 02:50:01.391
GIVEN THE REWARD. AND NOT PUT

02:50:01.457 --> 02:50:03.626
THIS ON AND SURPASSING USE THE

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:05.128
LEGISLATURE TO DO THE DO THE

02:50:05.194 --> 02:50:07.130
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS.

02:50:07.196 --> 02:50:09.098
THAT THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO

02:50:09.165 --> 02:50:11.067
GET IT FROM THE EMPLOYER SHOULD

02:50:11.134 --> 02:50:14.137
BE DONE. THEY SHOULDN'T BE-

02:50:14.203 --> 02:50:15.138
GRANT AND THERE SHOULD BE IN

02:50:15.204 --> 02:50:17.674
AND AROUND THE LEGISLATURE FOR

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:18.207
THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:50:18.274 --> 02:50:20.310
PROCESS. AND I WOULD SAY THAT

02:50:20.376 --> 02:50:22.946
NO MORE ANYMORE THAN IF WE WERE

02:50:23.012 --> 02:50:24.547
TO TAKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:27.350
FROM EACH EMPLOYEE FOR. FOR IT

02:50:27.417 --> 02:50:32.789
WAS A PRETTY SLOW YEAR. THEY.

02:50:32.855 --> 02:50:34.524
TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

02:50:34.591 --> 02:50:35.992
AND SO THIS WOULD BE THE SAME I

02:50:36.059 --> 02:50:37.160
THINK THIS IS THE SAME WAY I

02:50:37.226 --> 02:50:38.728
THINK WE'RE INTERFERING WHERE

02:50:38.795 --> 02:50:41.030
WE CANNOT. LOVE THE IDEA. BUT I

02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:42.031
THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY

02:50:42.098 --> 02:50:42.832
OF DOING IT AND I THINK THAT

02:50:42.899 --> 02:50:44.567
THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED BECAUSE

02:50:44.634 --> 02:50:45.168
THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE PUBLIC

02:50:45.234 --> 02:50:47.503
EMPLOYEES. AND IT WOULD GIVE US

02:50:47.570 --> 02:50:49.038
THE IDEA HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST

02:50:49.105 --> 02:50:50.340
AND WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD IT.

02:50:50.406 --> 02:50:52.909
IS THAT THAT BECOMES A BUTTON

02:50:52.976 --> 02:50:53.543
AND TURNING FACTOR IN A LOT OF

02:50:53.610 --> 02:50:56.546
THESE. THANK YOU FOR THE IDEA I

02:50:56.613 --> 02:50:58.448
APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. AND

02:50:58.514 --> 02:51:00.049
IF I MAKE A BRIEFLY ON THE

02:51:00.116 --> 02:51:01.851
CHAIR US IN MISSISSIPPI ARE TO

02:51:01.918 --> 02:51:03.820
AYE. I'VE HAD MANY SIMILAR

02:51:03.886 --> 02:51:06.889
CONVERSATIONS TO. GET AWAY WITH

02:51:06.956 --> 02:51:10.326
MY- CEOS OF HOSPITALS- IN IN IN

02:51:10.393 --> 02:51:14.664
MY DISTRICT AND- YEAH AND IN

02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:19.969
FACT I ASKED TO- THE ECONOMIST

02:51:20.036 --> 02:51:21.070
SAID THAT THE RESEARCH

02:51:21.137 --> 02:51:23.239
RESEARCHERS AT S. YEAH YOU FOR

02:51:23.306 --> 02:51:26.676
DATA ON- THE HOSPITAL'S I.

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:29.178
THINK SO WE ARE YOU KNOW TRYING

02:51:29.245 --> 02:51:30.013
TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

02:51:30.079 --> 02:51:31.247
ROOTED IN REALITY THAT THEY

02:51:31.314 --> 02:51:34.017
WERE TRYING TO- YOU KNOW

02:51:34.083 --> 02:51:36.152
ACHIEVE THOSE DUAL GOALS OF

02:51:36.219 --> 02:51:38.021
RECOGNIZING A RETAINING ARE

02:51:38.087 --> 02:51:39.455
HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHILE AT THE

02:51:39.522 --> 02:51:41.391
SAME TIME NOT IMPACTING ACCESS

02:51:41.457 --> 02:51:43.760
TO HEALTH CARE- I THINK THAT'S

02:51:43.826 --> 02:51:47.630
THE BOTTOM LINE- AND SO- I

02:51:47.697 --> 02:51:48.164
APPRECIATE YOUR TIME YOUR

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:51.968

03:14:43.705 --> 03:14:45.340
SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY- OVER THE

THE ON THE COURSE OF ITS OWN

03:14:50.879 --> 03:14:52.247
RIGHT NOW IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE

IN EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY. FIRST

03:14:54.749 --> 03:14:56.985
AND SO CERTAINLY TO THE- ONE OF

03:14:57.052 --> 03:14:57.819
THE POINTS RAISED ABOUT A

03:14:57.886 --> 03:14:59.521
SUNSET- AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE

03:14:59.587 --> 03:15:01.122

03:15:08.763 --> 03:15:09.931
CONCERNED BECAUSE- WE

03:15:09.998 --> 03:15:10.865
DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT

03:15:10.932 --> 03:15:12.367
ANYTHING MEMORIALIZED IN CODE

03:15:12.434 --> 03:15:13.535
THAT'S REQUIRING UNNECESSARY

03:15:13.601 --> 03:15:16.404
TESTING- AND PROCEDURES SO ARE

03:15:16.471 --> 03:15:17.138
THESE THE KINDS OF THINGS

03:15:17.205 --> 03:15:18.039
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU

03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:18.773
MENTION YOU WERE WORKING WITH

03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:20.475
THE CURRENT OPPOSITION ON SOME

03:15:20.542 --> 03:15:21.676

03:15:21.743 --> 03:15:23.478
APPARENTLY GO. ONE TO TALK TO

THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT WE TALK

03:15:26.915 --> 03:15:27.982
ABOUT A SUNSET I THINK BECAUSE

03:15:28.049 --> 03:15:29.617
OF. WE'RE SEEING THESE

03:15:29.684 --> 03:15:31.820

THINGS THAT MAKE MORALES SAID I

03:15:35.323 --> 03:15:36.157
THINK WOULD BE A ISSUE IF WE

03:15:36.224 --> 03:15:37.892
HAVE A SENSE OF BECAUSE WE NEED

03:15:37.959 --> 03:15:40.061
TO. BE PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE-

03:15:40.128 --> 03:15:40.662
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

HEAVEN FORBID THAT THAT DOESN'T

03:15:46.935 --> 03:15:48.136
THAT- THIS GETS BETTER

BETTER- YOU KNOW AND THERE.

THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF END

03:15:53.675 --> 03:15:54.976
POINT WHERE THIS IS NO LONGER

03:15:55.043 --> 03:15:57.212

MANNERS IN WHICH CORPORATE

03:32:24.298 --> 03:32:25.799
AMERICA THEY MAY BE LOOKING AT

03:32:25.866 --> 03:32:27.768
ONE ASPECT OF THE OTHER THIS IS

03:32:27.835 --> 03:32:28.302
GOING TO CREATE A UNIFORM

03:32:28.368 --> 03:32:30.304
STANDARD. IN ORDER FOR US TO

03:32:32.706 --> 03:32:33.207
THAT INDICATES A RECRUITING

03:32:33.273 --> 03:32:37.277
GOOD QUALITY JOBS. AND SO- WITH

03:32:37.344 --> 03:32:39.880
THE THAT'S- THAT'S THE REASON

03:32:39.947 --> 03:32:40.948
WHY WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S

03:32:41.014 --> 03:32:41.849
GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR LOOKED

03:32:41.915 --> 03:32:43.417
AT THAT AND I GOT TO GIVE

03:32:43.484 --> 03:32:45.285
CREDIT TO STATE CONTROLLER BUT

03:32:45.352 --> 03:32:47.087
HE'S HER TEAM AND PUT A

03:32:47.154 --> 03:32:48.822
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK IN

03:32:48.889 --> 03:32:49.556
TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT

03:32:49.623 --> 03:32:51.358
CATEGORIZATION OF WHAT DATA IS

03:32:51.425 --> 03:32:53.393
IMPORTANT. AS WELL AS THE

03:32:53.460 --> 03:32:54.995
DIFFERENT SECTORS AND THEY'VE

03:32:55.062 --> 03:32:56.396
BEEN WORKING WE'VE BEEN WORKING

03:32:56.463 --> 03:32:57.064
WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESS

03:32:57.131 --> 03:32:58.365
LEADERS AND BUSINESS

03:32:58.432 --> 03:32:59.900
ORGANIZATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT

03:32:59.967 --> 03:33:01.902
THOSE CRITERIA AND CATEGORIES

03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:03.270
SHOULD BE AND I THINK HAVING

03:33:03.337 --> 03:33:07.141
SOMETHING UNIFORMS FAR- THAT IS

03:33:07.207 --> 03:33:09.910
A USEFUL WELL FOR US AS A STATE

03:33:09.977 --> 03:33:12.646
IN TERMS OF ELEVATING HIGH ROAD

03:33:12.713 --> 03:33:15.149
EMPLOYERS- IT IS WHAT MATTERS

03:33:15.215 --> 03:33:17.718
THE MOST I THINK AS A- AS A

03:33:17.784 --> 03:33:19.419
STATE LEGISLATOR AS A IN TERMS

03:33:19.486 --> 03:33:21.221
OF PUTTING PART OF POLICY SO

03:33:21.288 --> 03:33:22.456
YES ARE THERE THINGS HAPPENING

03:33:22.523 --> 03:33:22.923
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

03:33:22.990 --> 03:33:23.557
ABSOLUTELY OF THAT REALLY

03:33:23.624 --> 03:33:25.792
INDICATES. THE FACT THERE'S A

03:33:25.859 --> 03:33:27.895
RECOGNITION THAT THAT THIS

03:33:27.961 --> 03:33:30.497
INFORMATION AND- DOES MATTER

03:33:30.564 --> 03:33:32.399
BUT THERE'S NOT A UNIFORM

03:33:32.466 --> 03:33:33.534
STANDARD THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO

03:33:33.600 --> 03:33:35.002
DO IS CREATE ONE THAT MAKES

03:33:35.068 --> 03:33:36.403
SENSE OF WORSHIP CALIFORNIA

03:33:36.470 --> 03:33:37.804
RIGHT WELL MIGHT NOT WORK FOR

03:33:37.871 --> 03:33:39.306
ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

03:33:39.373 --> 03:33:40.507
WHY SOME CORPORATIONS ARE

03:33:40.574 --> 03:33:41.909
MOVING TOWARDS THAT AND SUMMER

03:33:41.975 --> 03:33:43.877
LAGGING BEHIND BECAUSE THEY

03:33:43.944 --> 03:33:45.846
MIGHT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO

03:33:45.913 --> 03:33:47.047
AND CREATING THIS UNIFORM

03:33:47.114 --> 03:33:48.582
STANDARD IN A BILL THAT SAYS

03:33:48.649 --> 03:33:51.652
YOU HAVE TO DO IT- FORCES THEM

03:33:51.718 --> 03:33:53.654
INTO TERRITORY THAT THEY'RE NOT

03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:55.422
READY TO BE ABLE TO- TO

03:33:55.489 --> 03:33:57.791
PARTICIPATE IN. AND SO THE

03:33:57.858 --> 03:33:59.593
SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS I

03:33:59.660 --> 03:34:00.861
HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THIS IS

03:34:00.928 --> 03:34:02.896
ENCOURAGING HIGH PAYING JOBS

03:34:02.963 --> 03:34:04.198
HOW DOES ADVERTISING HOW

03:34:04.264 --> 03:34:05.766
DIFFICULT IT IS AND HOW HOW

03:34:05.832 --> 03:34:07.301
MUCH IT COSTS TO DO BUSINESS IN

03:34:07.367 --> 03:34:10.237
CALIFORNIA TO THE WORLD CREATE

03:34:10.304 --> 03:34:12.539
HIGH PAYING JOBS WHEN THAT

03:34:12.606 --> 03:34:14.141
WOULD DISCOURAGE ANYBODY FROM

03:34:14.208 --> 03:34:15.776
SETTING UP A CORPORATION HERE

03:34:15.842 --> 03:34:17.010
WELL I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

03:34:17.077 --> 03:34:19.313
CONTENTION BUT I WOULD SAY THAT

03:34:19.379 --> 03:34:19.780
THIS IS JUST REQUIRING

03:34:19.846 --> 03:34:21.748
PUBLISHING INFORMATION- OF THAT

03:34:21.815 --> 03:34:22.983
THEY ALREADY HAVE THESE

03:34:23.050 --> 03:34:24.785
COMPANIES FOR THE MOST PART. OF

03:34:24.851 --> 03:34:26.553
A THOUSAND MORE EMPLOYEES

03:34:26.620 --> 03:34:28.655
RIGHT- HAVE THIS DATA AND TO

03:34:28.722 --> 03:34:31.959
MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE- MY AT THE

03:34:32.025 --> 03:34:34.361
END OF THE DAY- IS THAT THE

03:34:34.428 --> 03:34:36.163
REALITY IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE

03:34:36.230 --> 03:34:41.568
DONE WELL IN. CALIFORNIA

03:34:41.635 --> 03:34:42.202

HIGH QUALITY- AND THAT'S WHAT

03:34:47.341 --> 03:34:49.676
I'VE- OF. A JOB AND THIS WAS

03:34:49.743 --> 03:34:52.212
NATURE. I WOULD DO AND THE

03:34:52.279 --> 03:34:53.547
REALITY IS THAT LOOK I MEAN A

03:34:53.614 --> 03:34:55.682
LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT MAY BE.

03:34:55.749 --> 03:34:56.183

OUT OF THE COMMISSION. AND SO.

03:35:46.466 --> 03:35:48.235
ALLOW THE CONTROLLER TO SPEAK

03:35:48.302 --> 03:35:50.404
TO THAT BUT- THE REALITY IS

03:35:50.470 --> 03:35:52.906
THAT A LOT OF THE- PUBLIC

03:35:52.973 --> 03:35:53.473
SECTOR INFORMATION INCLUDING

03:35:53.540 --> 03:35:56.343
OUR OWN. SALARIES ARE. PUBLICLY

03:35:56.410 --> 03:35:58.879
DISPOSABLE- AND ANOTHER SET

03:35:58.945 --> 03:36:00.213
BACK I CAN I CAN SPEAK TO THAT

03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:02.582
MR OUR PERHAPS YES PLEASE

MONITOR ABOUT OFFICIALS AND THE

03:36:04.685 --> 03:36:06.520
PUBLIC SECTOR- MOST OF THEM

03:36:06.586 --> 03:36:08.422
BECAUSE OF THE FIRST OF THOSE

03:36:08.488 --> 03:36:10.791
WAS REALLY TO TIE. UP THE

03:36:10.857 --> 03:36:12.159
REPORTING OF THE STANDARDS THAT

03:36:12.225 --> 03:36:15.228
SET OF DATA ON THE- ON STATE

03:36:15.295 --> 03:36:16.830
SPENDING SO IN OTHER WORDS TO

03:36:16.897 --> 03:36:20.600
LOOK AT HOW WE COULD NOT. HAVE

03:36:20.667 --> 03:36:22.602
THE IMPROVEMENT OF CONDITIONS

03:36:22.669 --> 03:36:24.004
FOR WORKERS THAT- WOULD BE

03:36:24.071 --> 03:36:25.439
INCENTIVIZED THROUGH THE STATE

03:36:25.505 --> 03:36:27.941
SPENDING SO. THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT

03:36:28.008 --> 03:36:29.609
THE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICULARLY

03:36:29.676 --> 03:36:31.878
HAS REPLACED IS. NOT DIVERTED

03:36:31.945 --> 03:36:32.746
BE DIRECTING BILLIONS OF

03:36:32.813 --> 03:36:34.181
DOLLARS TO A LARGE SCALE

03:36:34.247 --> 03:36:36.983
INITIATIVES- BUT- RESPECT

03:36:37.050 --> 03:36:38.018
INSPITE ENERGY TRANSPORTATION

03:36:38.085 --> 03:36:39.853
AND OTHER OTHER OTHER AREAS AS

03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:42.255
WELL- YOU KNOW I DO WANT TO

03:36:42.322 --> 03:36:49.429
EMPHASIZE. THAT- FEEL ABOUT

03:36:49.496 --> 03:36:50.664
THAT. TEKHELET SERVER IN THE

03:36:50.731 --> 03:36:52.799
BILL ARE REALLY WORK FORM A

03:36:52.866 --> 03:36:53.967
SURVEY BUT BUSINESS CAN. AND UP

03:36:54.034 --> 03:36:55.268
BEING ALMOST SEE. THAT THE WERE

03:36:55.335 --> 03:36:57.137
THE BEST THAT UP OR WERE EASY

03:36:57.204 --> 03:37:00.307
INITIALLY- OKAY FOR REPORTED

03:37:00.374 --> 03:37:02.109
AND KEPT TRACK OF BY- BY

03:37:02.175 --> 03:37:03.143
COMPANIES AND THE BUSINESS

03:37:03.210 --> 03:37:05.178
COMMUNITY SO OF THESE WERE NOT

03:37:05.245 --> 03:37:06.546
INVENTED OUT OF THIN AIR. I

03:37:06.613 --> 03:37:07.581
THINK THERE'S A CONSENSUS

03:37:07.647 --> 03:37:09.516
AROUND IS THAT TRICKS BEING

03:37:09.583 --> 03:37:13.720
READILY. AVAILABLE BY COMPANIES.

03:37:13.787 --> 03:37:18.291
SO THE PUBLIC SECTOR- BECAUSE

03:37:18.358 --> 03:37:21.528
THEIR DATA IS PUBLISHED THEY

03:37:21.595 --> 03:37:23.363
WOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE. I

03:37:23.430 --> 03:37:24.765
MEAN UP A PRIVATE ATTORNEY CAN

03:37:24.831 --> 03:37:25.599
COME NTO THE STATE OF

03:37:25.665 --> 03:37:28.535
CALIFORNIA AND SCOOT AND SUE

03:37:28.602 --> 03:37:29.102
SOMEBODY FOR PAY DISCREPANCY

03:37:29.169 --> 03:37:31.538
CORRECT. BECAUSE THERE'S

03:37:31.605 --> 03:37:32.806
MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT

03:37:32.873 --> 03:37:35.142
HAVE HAD BILLS. TO ALLOW OUR

03:37:35.208 --> 03:37:36.743
STAFF TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN

03:37:36.810 --> 03:37:38.211
BECAUSE OF THE DISCREPANCY.

03:37:38.278 --> 03:37:39.679
WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:45.519
INSTITUTION. SO MY FRUSTRATION

03:37:45.585 --> 03:37:48.321
ONCE AGAIN AS WE CONTINUE. TO

03:37:48.388 --> 03:37:50.657
HAMMER THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH

03:37:50.724 --> 03:37:52.726
ALL OF THESE RULES BUT WE DON'T

03:37:52.793 --> 03:37:53.293
CONTINUE TO FALL IN OUR OWN

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:55.328
HOUSE. THERE'S A MASSIVE

03:37:55.395 --> 03:37:58.632
DISCREPANCY. WITHIN STAFF PAY

03:37:58.698 --> 03:38:00.333
IN THIS BUILDING WITH OUR

03:38:00.400 --> 03:38:04.237
EMPLOYEES. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS

03:38:04.304 --> 03:38:09.009
WHAT. DOES THIS EXAMPLE STATE

03:38:09.075 --> 03:38:10.577
FROM BEING SUED FOR PAY

03:38:10.644 --> 03:38:14.314
DISCREPANCIES. I THINK I CAN

03:38:14.381 --> 03:38:15.782
ANSWER THAT NO BECAUSE ALL THAT

03:38:15.849 --> 03:38:18.051
INFORMATION IS PUBLIC AND IF

03:38:18.118 --> 03:38:19.252
ATTORNEYS WERE GOING TO TAKE

03:38:19.319 --> 03:38:20.320
THAT INFORMATION TO SUE THE

03:38:20.387 --> 03:38:22.022
STATE ALL THAT DATA IS READILY

03:38:22.088 --> 03:38:23.924
AVAILABLE SO THEN WHY IS IT

03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:25.926
REMOVAL FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS IF

03:38:25.992 --> 03:38:27.661
THEY PUBLISH ALL OF THIS. THE

03:38:27.727 --> 03:38:29.563
WHITE OF THE WISER PRIVATE

03:38:29.629 --> 03:38:31.631
RIGHT OF ACTION TO THIS. IF

03:38:31.698 --> 03:38:32.632
THEY CAN SUIT A PRIVATE

03:38:32.699 --> 03:38:33.800
BUSINESS FOR THIS BUT THEY

03:38:33.867 --> 03:38:35.368
CAN'T SEE THE STATE. WHAT AM I

03:38:35.435 --> 03:38:40.440
MISSING. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER

03:38:40.507 --> 03:38:41.508
FOR THAT THE ANSWER TO YOUR

03:38:41.575 --> 03:38:44.211
QUESTION WAS THE AVAILABILITY

03:38:44.277 --> 03:38:47.314
OF DATA FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES YES

03:38:47.380 --> 03:38:47.814
THAT IS AVAILABLE AND IF

03:38:47.881 --> 03:38:50.550
SOMEONE WERE. WANTED TO BUILD A

03:38:50.617 --> 03:38:52.185
SUIT AROUND THAT. THEY

03:38:52.252 --> 03:38:55.522
CERTAINLY COULD. SO THE STATE

03:38:55.589 --> 03:38:58.558
OF CALIFORNIA IS. AVAILABLE FOR

03:38:58.625 --> 03:39:01.928
LITIGATION OVER PAY DISCREPANCY.

03:39:01.995 --> 03:39:06.399
EVEN THOUGH IT'S PUBLISHED.

03:39:06.466 --> 03:39:07.767
BECAUSE IT IS AVAILABLE IF

03:39:07.834 --> 03:39:09.402
SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE THAT

03:39:09.469 --> 03:39:11.371
CASE THEY COULD TAKE THAT DATA

03:39:11.438 --> 03:39:12.806
AND BUILD A CASE THERE'S

03:39:12.873 --> 03:39:14.140
NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THAT.

03:39:14.207 --> 03:39:19.279
OKAY THANK YOU. THE DALLAS. WE

03:39:19.346 --> 03:39:20.947
DO HAVE PROVISIONS EQUAL PAY

03:39:21.014 --> 03:39:23.350
ACT THAT. WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT

03:39:23.416 --> 03:39:25.352
IN I. S. AS SOMEBODY WHO WROTE

03:39:25.418 --> 03:39:27.220
A BILL AND REFERRED AT THIS

03:39:27.287 --> 03:39:28.889
TIME AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE

03:39:28.955 --> 03:39:31.391
FUTURE THE TO PROVIDE OUR STAFF

03:39:31.458 --> 03:39:33.260
WITH A VERY IMPORTANT REAL.

03:39:33.326 --> 03:39:35.929
OPPORTUNITY TO ORGANIZE INTO A

03:39:35.996 --> 03:39:38.231
UNION- I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR

03:39:38.298 --> 03:39:41.067
THAT. I OTHER PEOPLE MAY RENT

03:39:41.134 --> 03:39:41.968
BILLS FOR OTHER REASONS BUT

03:39:42.035 --> 03:39:43.703
THAT DID NOT HAVE TO DO WITH

03:39:43.770 --> 03:39:44.337
THE PAY DISPARITY BECAUSE UNDER

03:39:44.404 --> 03:39:47.140
THIS- SPEAKER WE ACTUALLY DON'T

03:39:47.207 --> 03:39:48.909
HAVE A MALE AND FEMALE I THINK

03:39:48.975 --> 03:39:50.944
IT'S DOWN TO LIKE 2% OR

03:39:51.011 --> 03:39:52.612
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE COMPARED

03:39:52.679 --> 03:39:54.047
TO ANYTHING IN THE PRIVATE

03:39:54.114 --> 03:39:58.184
SECTOR SO- WE- WE SUFFER MANY.

03:39:58.251 --> 03:39:59.586

ALL THE RULES. OF LABOR LINE I

03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:09.563

WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE

03:45:23.209 --> 03:45:25.111

03:57:44.016 --> 03:57:46.085
WAS JUST THINKING AM PROUD TO

03:57:46.151 --> 03:57:47.219
BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THIS

03:57:47.286 --> 03:57:49.355
IT'S IMPORTANT POINT BILL AT

03:57:49.421 --> 03:57:51.190
JUST TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE

03:57:51.256 --> 03:57:52.891
MOST CONVENIENT AND SAFE WAY

03:57:52.958 --> 03:57:53.759
FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR

03:57:53.826 --> 03:57:57.062
VIEWS BUT IT'S STRANGE TO HEAR

03:57:57.129 --> 03:58:01.567
THE KIND OF- THE WARNINGS I

03:58:01.634 --> 03:58:02.835
SUPPOSE BY THE OPPOSITION

03:58:02.901 --> 03:58:04.603
BECAUSE JUST THIS MORNING I WAS

03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:07.539
THINKING ABOUT THIS MY- THE

03:58:07.606 --> 03:58:09.575
NINETEEN SCHOOLS. IN MY- MY

03:58:09.642 --> 03:58:10.676
CHILDREN'S CHARTER SCHOOL

03:58:10.743 --> 03:58:13.045
COLLABORATIVE- YOU KNOW DURING

03:58:13.112 --> 03:58:15.414
THE PANDEMIC THAT THE TEACHERS-

03:58:15.481 --> 03:58:17.149
ON THEIR OWN THE EMPLOYEES WENT

03:58:17.216 --> 03:58:18.984
AND GOT SIGNATURES TO FILE A

03:58:19.051 --> 03:58:20.953
PETITION. IN BECAUSE THE RULES

03:58:21.020 --> 03:58:22.054
AND PER WHICH IS ALSO

03:58:22.121 --> 03:58:23.555
CALIFORNIA RELATED THING THEY

03:58:23.622 --> 03:58:24.757
WILL GET UNION RECOGNITION

03:58:24.823 --> 03:58:28.327
FROM. SIMPLY TURNING IN A

03:58:28.394 --> 03:58:29.962
PETITION WITH YOU KNOW.

03:58:30.029 --> 03:58:31.196
EMPLOYEES AT WHO WANT TO JOIN

03:58:31.263 --> 03:58:33.499
THE UNION AND WE BELIEVE THAT

03:58:33.565 --> 03:58:34.667
PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY

03:58:34.733 --> 03:58:36.068
TEACHERS HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES

03:58:36.135 --> 03:58:38.070
THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT- AND

03:58:38.137 --> 03:58:41.073
YET SOMEHOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY

03:58:41.140 --> 03:58:43.075
MORE STRINGENT RUBIO THAT IS

03:58:43.142 --> 03:58:44.109
WHAT IT WOULD STILL BE

03:58:44.176 --> 03:58:45.644
HAPPENING UNDER THE L. R. B.

03:58:45.711 --> 03:58:49.248
SOMEHOW IS NOT- I. I THINK THAT

03:58:49.314 --> 03:58:50.582
INADEQUATE I THINK THOSE

03:58:50.649 --> 03:58:52.351
INEQUITIES THERE ARE STRIKING

03:58:52.418 --> 03:58:55.054
AND ONE OF THE REASONS PROBABLY

03:58:55.120 --> 03:58:59.825
WE HAVEN'T SEEN- SUCH AS-

03:58:59.892 --> 03:59:02.861
BARRIERS TO POOR MEAN- FOR

03:59:02.928 --> 03:59:04.196
WORKERS TO FEEL SAFE FORMING A

03:59:04.263 --> 03:59:05.831
UNION AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY

03:59:05.898 --> 03:59:06.999
SELF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING

03:59:07.066 --> 03:59:08.033
THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS THIS

03:59:08.100 --> 03:59:09.768
MAKES SENSE WITH VOTE BY MAIL

03:59:09.835 --> 03:59:11.370
WE DO THIS OFTEN YOU CAN HAVE

03:59:11.437 --> 03:59:12.938
SOMEBODY HELP YOU DO IT AND IT

03:59:13.005 --> 03:59:13.872
MAKES SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD BE

03:59:13.939 --> 03:59:15.607
ABLE TO DO IT FORMALLY. AS THE

03:59:15.674 --> 03:59:17.309
UNION AS WELL. THANK THANK YOU

03:59:17.376 --> 03:59:20.946
THE BILL THE SOMERSET SIR AND

03:59:21.013 --> 03:59:22.648
I'M GOING TO TAKE OUT ALL THE

03:59:22.715 --> 03:59:24.583
STUFF WE'VE HEARD AND GO

03:59:24.650 --> 03:59:26.585
STRAIGHT TO KIND OF PRACTICAL

03:59:26.652 --> 03:59:28.921
EVERYDAY THING I WAS A MEMBER

03:59:28.987 --> 03:59:31.657
OF A UNION FOR MANY MANY YEARS

03:59:31.724 --> 03:59:32.257
ONE OF THE BEST UNIONS IN THE

03:59:32.324 --> 03:59:36.428
STATE. AND WE ALWAYS GOT OUR

03:59:36.495 --> 03:59:39.031
BALLOTS WE ALWAYS VOTED. AND

03:59:39.098 --> 03:59:41.333
FRANKLY AS A SUPERVISOR AT

03:59:41.400 --> 03:59:42.601
TIMES AND THERE WAS STILL

03:59:42.668 --> 03:59:44.002
BECAUSE WE WERE UNION UP UNTIL

03:59:44.069 --> 03:59:47.339
WE'RE BATTALION CHIEF. AND AS A

03:59:47.406 --> 03:59:50.008
SUPERVISOR IN CAPTAIN. FRANKLY

03:59:50.075 --> 03:59:52.578
I WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW IF THE

03:59:52.644 --> 03:59:54.646
GUY NEXT TO ME IT WASN'T.

03:59:54.713 --> 03:59:56.615
DIDN'T VOTE FOR BEING IN A

03:59:56.682 --> 04:00:00.152
UNION OR NOT- AND THE REASON

04:00:00.219 --> 04:00:01.420
FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS

04:00:01.487 --> 04:00:03.388
GOING TO BE A BIAS. IF YOU

04:00:03.455 --> 04:00:05.758
BELIEVE IN THE UNION AND

04:00:05.824 --> 04:00:08.026
SOMEBODY NEXT TO YOU. WAS

04:00:08.093 --> 04:00:10.229
PARTICIPATING IN A IN A BALLOT

04:00:10.295 --> 04:00:12.397
THAT WE KNEW WHAT HE DID. AND

04:00:12.464 --> 04:00:14.299
NOT ONLY THAT BAD FOR HIM. BUT

04:00:14.366 --> 04:00:18.137
THAT'S BAD FOR US TO. AND I

04:00:18.203 --> 04:00:19.571
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH

04:00:19.638 --> 04:00:22.641
THE CURRENT PROCESS. IT HAS

04:00:22.708 --> 04:00:23.809
ALWAYS SEEMED TO WORK

04:00:23.876 --> 04:00:24.910
ESPECIALLY FOR UNIONS BECAUSE

04:00:24.977 --> 04:00:26.578
YOU HAVE A CONTROL GROUP THIS

04:00:26.645 --> 04:00:28.947
ISN'T LIKE THE UNITED STATES OF

04:00:29.014 --> 04:00:30.949
AMERICA IS A CONTROLLED GROUP.

04:00:31.016 --> 04:00:33.352
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. GET A

04:00:33.418 --> 04:00:35.988
BALLOT IN PHILADELPHIA WITHOUT

04:00:36.054 --> 04:00:36.588
SOMEBODY STANDING IN FRONT OF

04:00:36.655 --> 04:00:40.058
THEM. WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON

04:00:40.125 --> 04:00:41.226

04:00:47.533 --> 04:00:49.735
AND IT FOR UNIONS GOOD ENOUGH.

04:00:49.802 --> 04:00:51.236
THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

04:00:51.303 --> 04:00:53.238
IT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO SIGN UP.

04:00:53.305 --> 04:00:55.374

BALLOT FOR UNIONIZING AND IT

04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:06.285

NEED TO DO MORE TO BE ABLE TO

04:01:07.820 --> 04:01:10.289
GET PEOPLE ON BOARD. BUT I

04:01:10.355 --> 04:01:12.324
DON'T THINK CREATING A COERCIVE

04:01:12.391 --> 04:01:15.260
ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE. IS IN

04:01:15.327 --> 04:01:19.164

YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THIS

04:54:04.059 --> 04:54:06.528
THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS I

04:54:06.595 --> 04:54:09.098
REMEMBER GOING TO A- A SEMINAR

04:54:09.164 --> 04:54:11.033
OR- CONFERENCE OR WHATEVER YOU

04:54:11.100 --> 04:54:14.069
WANNA CALL IT. ON THE FUTURE OF

04:54:14.136 --> 04:54:16.505
THE WORK FORCE AND IT REALLY

04:54:16.572 --> 04:54:18.273
WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ROBOTICS

04:54:18.340 --> 04:54:21.944
INDUSTRY. AND HOW WE ARE KIND

04:54:22.011 --> 04:54:24.179
OF MARCHING TOWARDS THIS PATH

04:54:24.246 --> 04:54:26.115
WHERE ROBOTICS ARE EXPENSIVE.

04:54:26.181 --> 04:54:27.649
BUT AS WE MARCH FURTHER AND

04:54:27.716 --> 04:54:28.951
FURTHER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE

04:54:29.018 --> 04:54:30.686
WHERE ROBOTICS WILL EVENTUALLY

04:54:30.753 --> 04:54:32.755
BECOME MORE ECONOMICAL THAN

04:54:32.821 --> 04:54:35.324
HAVING PEOPLE WORK. AND I AM

04:54:35.391 --> 04:54:36.925
AFRAID OF THAT BECAUSE I DON'T

04:54:36.992 --> 04:54:39.495
WANT PEOPLE NOT WORKING. ONCE

04:54:39.561 --> 04:54:43.866
ROBOTS ROBOTS REPLACE WORKERS-

04:54:43.932 --> 04:54:45.467
GENERAL THEN I THINK WE'RE IN

04:54:45.534 --> 04:54:48.704
BIG TROUBLE. AND AND SO YOU

04:54:48.771 --> 04:54:50.239
KNOW THAT'S ONE OF MY FEARS

04:54:50.305 --> 04:54:52.441
WITH A LOT OF THESE- THIS

04:54:52.508 --> 04:54:54.243
INTRUSION INTO HOW PEOPLE RUN

04:54:54.309 --> 04:54:57.546
THEIR BUSINESSES- AND IT IS

04:54:57.613 --> 04:54:59.348
EVENTUALLY THEY WILL MAKE IT

04:54:59.415 --> 04:55:02.284
TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE EMPLOYEES

04:55:02.351 --> 04:55:03.819
THEY WON'T HAVE FIFTEEN OR

04:55:03.886 --> 04:55:05.621
TWENTY THEY'LL HAVE TWO OR

04:55:05.687 --> 04:55:06.655
THREE THAT ARE EXPERTS IN

04:55:06.722 --> 04:55:08.590
ROBOTICS AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU

04:55:08.657 --> 04:55:09.925
GO TO HIGH SCHOOL LOOK AT THE

04:55:09.992 --> 04:55:11.160
ROBOTICS TEAMS AND SOME OF THE

04:55:11.226 --> 04:55:13.062
THINGS THEY'RE DOING. YOU WILL

04:55:13.128 --> 04:55:14.063
KNOW WHERE THAT FUTURE WORK

04:55:14.129 --> 04:55:16.131
FORCE IS GOING TO COME FROM BUT

04:55:16.198 --> 04:55:17.833
IT WILL ONLY BE TWO OR THREE OF

04:55:17.900 --> 04:55:20.302
THEM. SO YOU KNOW THOSE AT YOU

04:55:20.369 --> 04:55:23.572
THAT'S KIND OF MY CONCERN. IS I

04:55:23.639 --> 04:55:25.974
THINK THAT WE ARE INTRUDING WAY

04:55:26.041 --> 04:55:28.310
TOO MUCH. INTO PRIVATE

04:55:28.377 --> 04:55:31.580
INDUSTRY. AND THE MORE WE DO

04:55:31.647 --> 04:55:32.448
THAT THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT

04:55:32.514 --> 04:55:35.050
GETS. AND THE MORE WE PUSH THEM

04:55:35.117 --> 04:55:36.985
INTO ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF

04:55:37.052 --> 04:55:38.120
RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AND

04:55:38.187 --> 04:55:40.489
PROVIDING YOUR SERVICES. AND

04:55:40.556 --> 04:55:43.125
YOU SEE THAT WITH THE AMAZON

04:55:43.192 --> 04:55:46.195
AND THEIR- THEIR DRONES THAT

04:55:46.261 --> 04:55:47.262
ARE DELIVERING INSTEAD OF THOSE

04:55:47.329 --> 04:55:50.232
FOLKS. AND YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I

04:55:50.299 --> 04:55:51.567
DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT I REALLY

04:55:51.633 --> 04:55:55.204
DON'T. SO ANYWAY. I HAVE A LOT

04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:56.205
OF OBJECTIONS TO WHERE WE'RE

04:55:56.271 --> 04:55:59.074
HEADED- I YOU KNOW I WANT

04:55:59.141 --> 04:56:00.776
PEOPLE TO BE SAFE AND I WANT

04:56:00.843 --> 04:56:01.410
THEM TO HAVE A GAINFUL

04:56:01.477 --> 04:56:03.579
EMPLOYMENT- BUT I DON'T THINK

04:56:03.645 --> 04:56:06.148
THIS IS THE PATH IT'S GOING TO

04:56:06.215 --> 04:56:08.217
PROVIDE THAT IN THE FUTURE.

ON IT BUT- BEFORE I CAME TO

04:56:35.010 --> 04:56:37.346
THIS GREAT INSTITUTION EIGHT

04:56:37.412 --> 04:56:38.180
YEARS AGO I WORKED FOR THE

04:56:38.247 --> 04:56:40.382
LABOR MOVEMENT AND EVERY SINGLE

04:56:40.449 --> 04:56:42.818
TIME WE TRY TO ESPECIALLY FOR

04:56:42.885 --> 04:56:44.353
LOW WAGE WORKERS TO IMPROVE THE

04:56:44.419 --> 04:56:46.255
CONDITIONS EITHER THROUGH

04:56:46.321 --> 04:56:48.123
PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS OR PUBLIC

04:56:48.190 --> 04:56:51.827
ACTION- THE ILLUSTRIOUS ROBOT

04:56:51.894 --> 04:56:53.362
HAS ALWAYS BEEN USED AS THE

04:56:53.428 --> 04:56:55.164
REASON TO NOT DO IT AND I THINK

04:56:55.230 --> 04:56:57.966
BACK TO THE WORKERS WHO. I'VE

04:56:58.033 --> 04:57:00.169
FOUGHT TO PROTECT. TWENTY YEARS

AGO. WHO SPENT THE LAST TWENTY

04:57:03.172 --> 04:57:04.606
YEARS IN CONDITIONS BECAUSE

04:57:04.673 --> 04:57:06.742
ROBOTS DIDN'T REPLACE THEM. SO

04:57:06.808 --> 04:57:08.343
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

04:57:08.410 --> 04:57:09.745
TO REALIZE YES TECHNOLOGY WILL

04:57:09.811 --> 04:57:10.312
HAPPEN THERE WILL BE

DO THINK THIS IS VERY VERY

05:16:39.280 --> 05:16:39.847
SIMILAR TO SB NINETY THREE THAT

05:16:39.914 --> 05:16:43.384
WE JUST. WHETHER THE BUDGET. SO

05:16:43.451 --> 05:16:44.819
I AM CURIOUS LIKE WHAT IS THE

05:16:44.885 --> 05:16:47.321
DIFFERENCE. M. AND THEN QUITE

05:16:47.388 --> 05:16:48.723
FRANKLY I KNOW THAT THE BILL'S

05:16:48.789 --> 05:16:52.860
GONE AND IT'S MOVED ON. BUT-

05:16:52.927 --> 05:16:53.994
WHY THAT BILL WAS IN THE BUDGET

05:16:54.061 --> 05:16:55.363
TRAILER BILL AND IT WASN'T

05:16:55.429 --> 05:16:57.531
POLICY BILL AND THIS ONE IS A

05:16:57.598 --> 05:16:58.566
WE'RE DEBATING IT NOW TODAY

05:16:58.632 --> 05:17:00.468
BECAUSE- IT ESSENTIALLY IS

05:17:00.534 --> 05:17:01.936
DOING AFFECT SAME THING. BUT

05:17:02.002 --> 05:17:05.239
EXPANDING IT- TO SMALLER AND

05:17:05.306 --> 05:17:06.140
TAKE OUT THE COVERT NINETEEN

05:17:06.207 --> 05:17:08.376
PROVISIONS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT

05:17:08.442 --> 05:17:09.343
TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE

05:17:09.410 --> 05:17:12.680
AND I UNDERSTAND IT TO BE

05:17:12.747 --> 05:17:14.014
HONEST IT DOES GET CONFUSING.

05:17:14.081 --> 05:17:16.917
IF IT WERE- LIKE THE ORDINANCE

05:17:16.984 --> 05:17:18.919
WE PASS FOR EXAMPLE FOR GROCERY

05:17:18.986 --> 05:17:21.689
WORKERS NOT LONG AGO THAT THAT.

05:17:21.756 --> 05:17:23.124
IS MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

05:17:23.190 --> 05:17:24.692
PASSED IN NINETY THREE- THAT

05:17:24.759 --> 05:17:26.527
HAS THE PROTECTION UPON SALE

05:17:26.594 --> 05:17:28.529
THAT THOSE WORKERS REMAIN PART

05:17:28.596 --> 05:17:30.731
OF- GET THEY THEY GO WITH THE

05:17:30.798 --> 05:17:32.600
SALE FOR NINETY DAYS THAT'S-

05:17:32.666 --> 05:17:34.034
THAT'S WHAT WE HAD DO TO COPE

05:17:34.101 --> 05:17:36.303
ED. IT IN NINETY THREE DOES

05:17:36.370 --> 05:17:38.472
THAT MAKE SENSE. THIS HAS TO DO

05:17:38.539 --> 05:17:40.107
WITH THE CONTRACTORS INSIDE THE

05:17:40.174 --> 05:17:41.842
HOTEL SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

05:17:41.909 --> 05:17:43.511

05:17:43.577 --> 05:17:45.513

A NEW CONTRACTOR COME IN- AND

05:18:00.461 --> 05:18:02.029

REQUIRE THE SAME EMPLOYEES IT'S

05:18:03.931 --> 05:18:06.033
A CHANGE OF CONTRACTOR THESE

05:18:30.124 --> 05:18:30.724
THIS GIVES THEM THAT

05:18:30.791 --> 05:18:32.193
OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN HOST

05:18:32.259 --> 05:18:34.195
WHOLESALE BUYERS- JUST BECAUSE

05:18:34.261 --> 05:18:35.930
THE CONTRACTORS REMOTE. DURING

05:18:35.996 --> 05:18:37.398
KOBE AT POST COVER THIS MAY BE

05:18:37.465 --> 05:18:38.566

THAT MIGHT HAVE GONE OUT OF

05:18:39.567 --> 05:18:40.935
BUSINESS YOU KNOW AND YET YOU

05:18:41.001 --> 05:18:42.536

EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL THIS IS

05:18:50.177 --> 05:18:51.412
THAT THE CONTRACTORS. THAT MAKE

05:18:51.479 --> 05:18:53.581
