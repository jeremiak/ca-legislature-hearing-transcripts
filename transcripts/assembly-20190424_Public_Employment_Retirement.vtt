00:36:37.628 --> 00:36:38.362

THE SIX MONTH PERIOD FOR A NON

00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:02.186
MERIT DISTRICTS WERE CONCERNED

00:37:02.253 --> 00:37:04.288
THAT THIS IN FACT WILL FORCE

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:06.490
DECISIONS ABOUT -- PERMITTED

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.025
EMPLOYEES THAT WILL ACTUALLY BE

00:37:08.092 --> 00:37:10.695
DISADVANTAGES TO THOSE EMPLOYEES.

00:37:10.761 --> 00:37:12.630
AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:16.500
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:18.035
THANK YOU.

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:18.669
GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DEREK

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:19.303
CLINICS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.037
EMPLOYERS ASSOCIATION OF

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.272
CALIFORNIA.

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:22.673
ARE LETTER IS NOT REFLECTED IN

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.874
THE ANALYSIS AND THE REASON IS

00:37:23.941 --> 00:37:24.976
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:27.244
YOUR STAFF ON THIS -- BUT

00:37:27.311 --> 00:37:29.113
UNFORTUNATELY WE MUST OPPOSED A

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.748
FOR TWO REASONS OUR CONCERNS ARE

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.016
FIRST THAT THE SIX MONTH TIME

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:33.584
PERIOD IS SIMPLY TOO SHORT TO

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:35.152
MAKE A PROPER EVALUATION OF THE

00:37:35.219 --> 00:37:37.922
EMPLOYEE -- BOTH OUR EMPLOYERS

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:39.523
THAT WE'VE TALKED TO AS WELL AS

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.591
SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:41.192
THEY'VE CONFERRED WITH HAVE

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.693
AGREED THAT IT MAY NOT BE IN THE

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.562
BEST INTEREST OF THE EMPLOYEE

00:37:44.629 --> 00:37:46.163
AND EMPLOYER. TO HAVE THE SIX

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:47.832
MONTHS ESPECIALLY WHERE SKILLED

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:50.468
TRADES ARE INVOLVED WHERE --

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.837
COMPLEX SECRETARIAL WORK OR

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:53.938
ANYTHING INVOLVING.

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:55.373
ADDITIONAL TRAINING.

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:58.175
MAY BE THAT DISADVANTAGEOUS. TO

00:37:58.242 --> 00:37:58.776
SOMEBODY WHO'S ON A LEARNING

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:00.144
CURVE IN NEED THE ADDITIONAL

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.613
TIME SO HARD SIX MONTHS IS

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.382
DIFFICULT IN THAT SENSE AND THEN

00:38:04.448 --> 00:38:05.416
THE SECOND REASON IS SIMPLY

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:07.018
BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ALREADY

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:08.486
ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO GO TO SIX

00:38:08.552 --> 00:38:09.120
MONTHS.

00:38:09.186 --> 00:38:10.788
OF THE PRIOR WITNESS MENTIONED A

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:12.056
NUMBER DISTRICTS GO BELOW THE

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.024
TWELVE MONTHS WE THINK IT'S

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.326
TOTALLY REASONABLE FOR DISTRICTS

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.495
IN THEIR BARGAINING PARTNERS TO

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.463

BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AND I WANT

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:32.761
TO POINT OUT THAT -- ALL OF OUR

01:10:32.828 --> 01:10:34.597
PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS DEAL WITH

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:36.198
THAT OF COURSE IN THEIR OWN

01:10:36.265 --> 01:10:37.633
BARGAINING ON WHETHER IT'S

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:39.034
BECAUSE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT OR

BECAUSE OF THE STATE BUDGET --

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:42.438
THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT

01:10:42.504 --> 01:10:43.372
THE UNIONS TAKE INTO

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.307
CONSIDERATION OBVIOUSLY I WANT

THERE ARE TWO MEMBERS -- ALONG

01:11:06.395 --> 01:11:07.730
WITH MYSELF OBVIOUSLY WHO

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:08.998
STARTED IN THIS BUILDING AS

01:11:09.064 --> 01:11:11.166
ENTRY LEVEL STAFF -- FOLKS WHO

01:11:11.233 --> 01:11:12.801
HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE PROCESS OF

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:15.070
SERVING UNDER LEGISLATORS AND

01:11:15.137 --> 01:11:18.240
AND AND FOLKS WHO MIGHT BE.

01:11:18.307 --> 01:11:20.576
GOOD BENEVOLENT -- BOSSES AND

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:22.444
YET THEY SEE THE NEED -- TO

01:11:22.511 --> 01:11:23.679
ALLOW WORKERS THIS VERY

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:26.448
FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT I THINK I AM

01:11:26.515 --> 01:11:28.183
AS WE MOVE FOR IT WHAT ONE THING

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.051
THAT WAS SAID IS IT'S GOOD FOR

01:11:29.118 --> 01:11:30.653
EMPLOYEES BUT IT'S GOOD FOR

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:31.587
EMPLOYERS TO AND I WOULD NOTE

01:11:31.654 --> 01:11:32.087
THAT.

01:11:32.154 --> 01:11:33.889
HAVING AND I THINK ANY OF US WHO

01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:36.659
HAVE EVER TRIED -- TO TO REPLACE

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.961
STAFF ON ON OUR TEAMS KNOW THAT

01:11:39.028 --> 01:11:41.196
AS OUR HR DEPARTMENT IS NOT SET

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.799
UP TO UNDERSTAND HOW.

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.567
TO NEGOTIATE THAT PROCESS IN A

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:47.536
WAY THAT THAT MAKES SENSE OF

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:51.807
FEAR OF LAWSUITS THAT FEAR OF OF

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.609
PUBLIC EXPOSURE MAKES THAT

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.611
UNCLEAR FOR BOTH THE WORKER AND

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.346
THOSE OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:58.013
GET THE RIGHT.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.548
I'M WORKPLACE BALANCE SO EVEN

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.583
WITH BECAUSE WHERE UNDER A UNION

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.218
EMPLOYEE OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT

01:12:03.285 --> 01:12:05.421
IT'S VERY CLEAR ON THE PROCESS

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.089
BY WHICH YOU GO THROUGH THERE'S

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.490
A GRIEVANCE PROCESS THERE'S A

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.225
WAY IN WHICH THE EMPLOYER HAS

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:11.960
CERTAINTY AT AND AND WE DON'T

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:13.328
HAVE THAT THE BUILDING.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:14.763
AS LEGISLATORS AND I THINK THAT

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.598
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE PIECE

01:12:16.665 --> 01:12:18.534
TO NOTE HOWEVER AT THE END OF

01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:25.007
THE DAY.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:25.607
BOTTOM LINE IS I'M DOING THIS

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.376
BECAUSE AS MY STAFF WOULD LIKE

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:28.310
THE OPTION OF COLLECTIVELY

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:28.610
BARGAINING.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.545
I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WANTED

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:30.212
BECAUSE I'M IN A BAD EMPLOYER I

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:30.879
DON'T THINK THEY WANT IT BECAUSE

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.381
I SOMEHOW DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.

01:12:32.448 --> 01:12:33.615
BUT THE TRUTH IS THIS NO MATTER

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:34.750
HOW MUCH I LISTEN TO THEM I

01:12:34.817 --> 01:12:36.685
CAN'T AFFECT WORKPLACE RULES IN

01:12:36.752 --> 01:12:37.686
THIS BUILDING.

01:12:37.753 --> 01:12:41.190
SO AS AS GOOD AS I AM TO THEM I

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.559
I CAN CALL RULES AND ASK I CAN

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.928
COLLECTIVELY BAG FOR CHANGES --

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.830
BUT WE CAN'T HAVE A TRUE VOICE

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.298
WE AS LEGISLATORS DON'T HAVE A

01:12:49.364 --> 01:12:51.033
TRUE VOICE ON EMPLOYMENT

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.434
PRACTICES IN THIS BUILDING.

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.403
ALL ON WORKPLACE SAFETY ISSUES

01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:56.972
ON ON UP CALENDARS IN IN AND

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.475
RIGHTS IN SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THE

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:02.010
HELPLESSNESS THAT OUR WORKERS

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.879
ARE EMPLOYEES FEEL THAT THEY

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:05.547
CAN'T COME TOGETHER AND VOICE

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:06.882
THEIR OPINION WITHOUT

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:08.917
RETALIATION WITHOUT WORRY.

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.819
AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME LEVERAGE

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:12.321
TO MAKE CHANGES TO THAT THAT'S

01:13:12.387 --> 01:13:14.089
WHAT WE WANTED TO HEAR I DON'T

01:13:14.156 --> 01:13:14.923
THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO BE

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.492
AFRAID OF AND I THINK UP AGAIN

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:17.993
IF WE DON'T WANNA BE HYPOCRITES

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:19.661
AND WE WANT TO LIVE OUR VALUES.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:20.996
THAT WE TREAT OUR OWN WORKERS

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.164
LIKE EVERY OTHER WORKER IN
