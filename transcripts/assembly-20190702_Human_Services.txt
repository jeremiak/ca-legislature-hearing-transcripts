SERVICES COMMITTEE. TODAY WE HAVE NINE BILLS ON THE AGENDA WITH THREE BILLS ON CONSENT. AS A REMINDER WE LIMIT TESTIMONY TO TO WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION EACH WITNESS HAS TWO MINUTES TO TESTIFY ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES MATT ON BY STATING THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WE TAKE OUR OUR BILLS BY SIGNED IN ORDER AND THAT DOCTOR PAM. WE'VE GOT YOUR FIRST. ON ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB FIVE TWELVE WELCOME. WE'LL BE STARTING OUT AS A SUB COMMITTEE AS WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SHALL BEGIN YES PLEASE THANK THANK YOU SO MUCH MEDICARE MEMBERS -- BUT THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE PRESENT TO SB FIVE TWELVE WHICH TAKES THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP IN CREATING A LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OUR L. TSS BENEFIT FOR CALIFORNIA. THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION THIS THE BENEFIT IS URGENT ALMOST EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER OLDER ADULTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL MENTAL DISABILITIES CURRENTLY LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS POPULATION WILL GROW SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE BUT UNFORTUNATELY MANY CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE L. TSS SERVICES. WHAT TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MOST CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO PURCHASE PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE AND I THINK WE KNOW THAT THAT MARKET ALSO? IS QUITE TROUBLED. PAYING FOR OUT OUT OF POCKET FOR L. TSS IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND CREATES A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SOCIAL BURDEN. SO WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE WHILE CALIFORNIANS MUST SPEND DOWN THROUGH LIFE SAVINGS TO BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE NOW. AND TOO OFTEN THIS IS THE PRIMARY MEANS BY WHICH OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE ACCESS TO PAY LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES. MEDI CAL IS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET BUT THE SYSTEM IS OVERBURDENED AS WE KNOW AS WE GO THROUGH OUR BUDGET PROCESS. INDIVIDUALS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO IMPOVERISH THEMSELVES AND SPENT THROUGH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS AND OUR CHILDREN'S INHERITANCE OR TO FOREGO WORKING WHICH IS THE OTHER THING THAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- YOU NEED THE SERVICES AND IF YOU GO WORK YOU ACTUALLY MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY AND THAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOUR CERTAIN SERVICES SO YOU FOR GO WORKING AND GENERATING EARNED INCOME IN ORDER TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. THESE THEY NEED TO LIVE INDEPENDENT HIGH QUALITY LIVES. SO THIS LEGISLATION IS TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF LONG TERM SERVICES SUPPORTS. BENEFITS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SPECIFICALLY SB FIVE TWELVE CREATES THE INFRASTRUCTURE MODELED AFTER THE CALCIUM OR SECURE CHOICE PROGRAM FOR WHEN CALIFORNIA'S RATE THE DESIGN AND FINANCE THIS NEW BENEFIT. INDEED THIS LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM BELT YES A STAKEHOLDERS. WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD NOW TO PUT THESE CRITICAL PIT PLATE PIECES IN PLACE SO WE CAN CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD WITH BENEFIT AND FINANCING DESIGN. SOME PLEASED TO HAVE THE TESTIFYING SUPPORT -- TEST MAY FOR THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND THE A. R. P. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WITNESSES THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CHRISTINA MALES I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION FOR INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS WE ARE A MEMBERSHIP ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT LIVING NETWORK. AND CURRENTLY REPRESENT TWENTY TWO OF THE TWENTY EIGHT CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS ARE ADVOCACY AND SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS RUN BY AND FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THEY'RE NOT PLACES YOU LIVE. INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS PROVIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES FOR PEOPLE OF ALL TYPES OF DISABILITIES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING AND BEING A TAX CONTRIBUTING MEMBER OF MY COMMUNITY FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. I WAS BORN WITH MY DISABILITY AND RELIED ON SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME AND MEDICAID SERVICES UNTIL I BECAME WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED BY THIS. BY THE SYSTEM. TRANSITIONING FROM PUBLIC BENEFITS TO KNOW SUPPORT WAS AND REMAINS ONE OF THE HUGEST DECISIONS OF MY LIFE. I RELIED ON MEDICAID SERVICES EVERY TIME I BROKE A BONE FRACTURE NEED SURGERY A NEW WHEEL CHAIR PHYSICAL THERAPY A WALKER CRUTCHES AND SO MANY OTHER HEALTH CARE NECESSITIES. MY EYES WERE WIDE OPEN WHEN I MADE THE DECISION TO LEAVE MY SAFETY NET BEHIND AND TAKE A JOB. ALTHOUGH I WOULD NEVER ALTHOUGH I WOULD FOR EVERY NEED LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE SOCIETY GIVE TO SOCIETY. AND BE PAID FOR MY WORK. I HAVE MANAGED TO GET. BY FOR A WHILE WITHOUT L. TSS MEDICAID SERVICES SPECIFICALLY BUT AS I CONTINUE TO AGE WITH A DISABILITY I FIND MYSELF WITH LESS AND LESS SAVINGS. AND MORE OUT OF POCKET EL TSS EXPENSES. I CONSIDER MY COMPANY'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN TO BE PRETTY DECENT. HOWEVER WITH THAT I AM STILL PAYING ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF POCKET FOR L. TSS. SOMETIMES IT'S DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY A WHOLE MODIFICATION OR DOMESTIC SERVICES THAT I NEED IN MY HOME. IT ALL ADDS UP AND MAKES THOSE OF US WHO ARE WORKING HARD TO MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT AND SAY FAR FUTURES. IT FEELS AS THOUGH WERE BARELY HOLDING ON TO A CLIFF FOR SURVIVAL. MY ORGANIZATION AND I ASK YOU FOR JUST SUPPORTER ON SB FIVE ONE TWO BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO CREATE AN L. D. S. THAT'S FRAMEWORK. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR BOTH AGING AND DISABILITY COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO THE MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE AN ACCIDENT AWAY FROM BEING IN THE SAME SITUATION AS ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M JENNIFER VERDUGO MINNESOTA SEAT STATE DIRECTOR FOR A A. R. P. REPRESENTING OUR THREE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA MEMBERS. AIR P. IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA AGING AND DISABILITY ALLIANCE WHICH IS SPONSORING SB. FIVE TWELVE SB FIVE TWELVE IS A PRIORITY FOR A A RP AND THE SIMPLE REASON IS THIS. I'LL TIAS HAS COST MORE THAN WHAT MOST CALIFORNIANS CAN AFFORD. AIR P. RESEARCH FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOWS THAT DESPITE A MEDIAN INCOME FOR OLDER DON'T HOUSEHOLDS OF FIFTY THOUSAND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL COST OF A NURSING HOME IS DOUBLE THAT. A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN THOUSAND FOR A PRIVATE ROOM AND NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND FOR SHARED ROOM. HIRING A HOME HEALTH AIDE TO PROVIDE CARE AT HOME FOR THIRTY HOURS A WEEK IS THIRTY NINE THOUSAND A YEAR. SO IT'S EASY TO SEE HOW MOST CALIFORNIA FAMILIES SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD THIS. AND EVEN FEWER CAN AFFORD LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE IN FACT ONLY PURCHASED THE POLICY. TODAY I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF TO OUR OF OUR OUR OF OUR VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE SHARED THEIR STORIES AND SEVERAL COMMITTEES THIS YEAR AND SB. FIVE TWELVE THE REASON CAN RADO COME MARINO AND DAVID FEINSTEIN CAN'T BE HERE TODAY WAS BECAUSE THERE CARE GIVING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES THIS WEEK. DAVID IS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH HIS MOTHER. THANK IN RADO IS HELPING TO MANAGE CARE GIVING FOR ONE OF MANY RELATIVES HE HELPS TO CARE. FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS LIKENED RADO AND DAVID SPEND AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OUT OF OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES CARING FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. AIR P. IS ALSO FOUND THAT THOSE CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA CAN SPEND NEARLY ELEVEN THOUSAND A YEAR I'M LEFT ONCE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE REALITY FOR MANY. DAVID'S MOTHER IS NINETY FOUR AND LIVING IN A MEMORY FACILITY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE COST OF CARE IS A LITTLE OVER NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. BUT THE MONEY MONTHLY INCOME SHE RECEIVED THEIR A SMALL VETERANS PENSION AND SOCIAL SECURITY DOES NOT EVEN COVER HALF THE CARE. AS AN ONLY CHILD DAVID FEELS RESPONSIBLE TO PAY THE REMAINING BALANCE HE'S USING HIS OWN RETIREMENT SAVINGS TO PAY THE REMAINDER OF THE BILL. THIS REDUCING WHAT HE AND HIS WIFE WILL HAVE SHOULD THEY NEED THEIR OWN CARE IN THE FUTURE. FOR CAN RADO. COMING FROM A LARGE FAMILY CARE GIVING IS A FAMILY AFFAIR. AT ANY ONE TIME HE HAS A WIFE AND THEIR SIBLINGS ARE IN THE THROES OF CARE GIVING FOR AN AGING OR DISABLED FAMILY MEMBER. THEY'VE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. OF OUT OF POCKET -- TO CARE FOR THEIR PARENTS. THEY'VE TAKEN TIME OFF OF WORK TO CARE FOR THEIR LOVED ONES AND HAVE NAVIGATED THE DISJOINTED FRAGMENTED PATCHWORK OF ALL TSS SERVICES. AS CAN RADO HAS TOLD US MANY TIMES THIS IS WHAT FAMILIES DO. WE CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER CHOICE. BOTH DAVID IN COLORADO ENVISION A TIME WHEN FAMILIES LIKE THEIRS WILL HAVE OPTIONS WHEN OTHERS WON'T HAVE TO SPEND AS MUCH OUT OF POCKET AS THEY DID. AND WON'T HAVE TO TAKE TIME OFF OF WORK. DEALING WITH LOST WAGES AND LOST FUTURE SOCIAL SECURITY AND COME. THIS IS WHY A R. P. URGES YOU TO PASS SB FIVE TWELVE FOR FAMILIES LIKE CAN RATOS AND DAVID'S. AND FOR THE NEARLY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION FAMILY CARE GIVERS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I AM MY NAME MOVE THE THE BID LOW. EIN BIER RENDON THEN LIAM WHOOPED.

HELLO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON WITH YOU W. -- WE'RE MEMBER OF KEITA THE GROUP SPONSORING THE BILL.

WE SPEND VIRTUALLY NONE OF THAT TIME TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS IS CREATING POVERTY AND HOW THIS IS RESULTING IN HOMELESSNESS. ALL WE HAVE TO EXPAND THIS DISCUSSION IN THIS BUILDING TO INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND SENIORS WERE BEING IMPOVERISHED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T.

SEEING NONE LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE TO THE COMMITTEE. COMMENTS QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES DOCTOR CHOI. THANK YOU A CHE ARE AN INCENTIVE PAN -- I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT -- TOPIC LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. OR PEOPLE WHO SELL UNABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THE PARTICULARLY UP AGING POPULATION -- I'M GETTING THEY ARE -- THEY ALREADY. MY MOTHER IS -- OF BEING TAKEN CARE OF NINETY SIX YEARS OLD LADY. AND THE MANY FEMINISTS ARE FACING THIS A CRITICAL ISSUE -- YOUR BILL IS -- PROPOSING TO ESTABLISH. A CALIFORNIA LONG TERM SERVICES SUPPORT. OF BENEFITS OF WAR. BUT IT DOESN'T MENTION. WHAT IT WILL DO EXACTLY AND OFF WITH A FUNDING WILL COME FROM? AND ON HOW THE BENEFICIARY OF ANY FISHERIES WILL BE DEFINED TO HOLD THE BENEFITING AND HOW MUCH. A TO ASSIST SUCH TRUST -- SO THIS IS A MORE LIKE A SOCIAL SECURITY KIND OF THING BUT THE SOURCE OF SECURITY AMOUNT IS NOT ENOUGH -- SHOULD NOT TO LEAVE AND THE WITH THE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MINIMUMS SO MY MODEM MONEY OR WHAT WILL IT REALLY TAKE CARE OF THE NEEDY PEOPLE WERE. IN ON A TO BE IN THE INSTITUTION FOR THE A TOTAL CARE. DO YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED BUT BECAUSE DOT ORG ON ALICE'S SAYS THAT THE U. APPEAL IS THAT ACTING IS ARE NOT WELL PREPARED. AND THE NO MENTION ABOUT FUNDING CAN YOU ELABORATE IF YOU TO HELP. ONE SO FIRST OF ALL I WOULD MENTION THAT THE ABOUT THE FUNDING FOR THE BILL ITSELF IS ACTUALLY A PART OF THE THE BUDGET THAT IS NOW BEEN ENACTED IN. NOW IN PLACE IT'S AN OUT SINCE IT'S JULY -- BUT THE WHAT WE NEED TO DO WHAT THE BILL DOES WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS ACTUALLY. DOES VERY QUESTIONS THAT YOU RAISE THIS FIGURE THAT OUT RIGHT. WE KNOW THAT -- WE ACTUALLY AT A HEARING OF THE SENATE BUT SAVE COMMITTEE. NUMBER THREE AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU KNOW. THAT -- ALSO DID BEEN HEARINGS AND SO FORTH EXAMINATIONS AND SIMPLY SIDES WELL KNOWING THAT WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION. WE HAVE ALSO WITH PEOPLE. WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT -- WE THE ONLY INFRASTRUCTURE READ WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS ESSENTIALLY MEDI CAL SO WE ARE PAYING. FOR THESE SERVICES THROUGH MEDICARE HOW WHAT WE DO THE TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE TO SPEND DOWN ALL YOUR MONEY -- IF YOU'RE A PERSON WITH DISABILITIES YOU CAN'T WORK ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE YOU BASICALLY. MAKE IF YOU MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY YOU FALL OUT RIGHT SO WE'RE WE'VE HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE TRAPPING PEOPLE INTO -- INTO POVERTY ESSENTIALLY IN ORDER TO GET TO THE SIDE TO SERVICES AND AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW FROM A FROM A STATE BUDGETARY STANDPOINT -- THAT'S ALSO AN ISSUE TOO BECAUSE WE BAY IS THAT THE WISEST USE OF OUR MONEY IS BASICALLY SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE WANT EVERYONE TO SPEND DOWN INTO POVERTY AND THEN TRAP THEM THERE AND THEN THAT'S WHEN THEY CAN ACCESS THE SERVICES BECAUSE WE ARE PAYING. FOR LONG TERM SUPPORT SERVICES. SO WHAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT OKAY WE WILL CREATE A FRAMEWORK TO SAY ALL RIGHT WELL WHAT CAN WE TRY TO DO -- IN. TO SET UP A PROGRAM YOU YOU MADE THE AND WE MENTIONED CAL SAVERS YOU MENTIONED SOCIAL SECURITY BUT LET ME WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE CREATE A STRUCTURE KNOWING THAT WE HAVE AN AGING POPULATION WE HAVE. FOUR PEOPLE THIS THE ONLY PEOPLE DISABILITIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE ABLE TO LEAD ACTIVE LIVES AND ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE. IN MANY WAYS INCLUDING ECONOMICALLY TO OUR COMMUNITY AND SHOULD WE TRY TO CREATE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND AND THAT I THINK THAT WHAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT AND SO HIGH AND HOW WHAT WOULD THAT TAKE. RIGHT WHAT WITH THAT TAKES YOU POSE THAT QUESTION AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND THAT'S WAY AM. PLEASED TO HAVE THE TREASURER'S OFFICE. US IN SUPPORT BECAUSE WE WHILE WORKING AND AND AND DO THAT ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS AND SAY WHAT WOULD IT TAKE BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A PRIVATE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE -- THAT IS NOT WORKING RIGHT IT'S WE HAVE A THE THE THE THE THAT COVERAGE IS NOT REALLY THAT AVAILABLE IT'S EXPENSIVE -- THERE'S A LOT OF ADVERSE SELECTION ISSUES THAT ARE INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE SO WE NEED TO THINK. ABOUT WHAT HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS. HAVE ANOTHER OPTION OTHER THAN SPENDING DOWN THE POVERTY THE OTHER THING IS IS THAT OFTENTIMES THE RULES THAT WE CREATE NELLY TO TRAP PEOPLE POVERTY SOMETIMES EVEN PUSH THEM TOWARD INSTITUTIONALIZATION WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE AND BY THE WAY WE'RE BEARING THE BILL OF THAT. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS -- BECAUSE THEY GO IN MEDI CAL AND THEN THAT'S THE ONLY CHOICE PEOPLE HALF AND SO -- YEAH WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT. CAN WE THINK IT THINK ABOUT HOW WE WE THEN BE ABLE TO USE WHATEVER FUNDING WE WE ESTABLISH. TO DE BE ABLE TO USE IT MORE WISELY IN A WAY THAT LETS PEOPLE BETTER. LIVE IN PLACE AN AGING PLACE AND AND SO FORTH AS WELL SO BUT THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE FIGURED OUT AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS URGENT BECAUSE WE KNOW THE POPULATION IS GETTING OLDER. WE CAN SEE THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGE BUT YET WE HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS QUESTION OUT YET. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL THE BELLS LIKE WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT I MEAN WE CAN. EVENTUALLY WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT OTHERWISE WILL HAPPEN IS IS THAT. IF WE LEAVE THINGS THE WAY THEY ARE THE FALL PLAN IS IS THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE MORE MORE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW SPENDING DOWN THE POVERTY. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT AND THEN ON A MEDICARE PROGRAM AND WE'RE FORGETTING HOW TO DO THE MEDICAL BUDGET EACH YEAR AND SO WE'VE I JUST AS A MEDIC COW. AND AT DAHLE TELL USE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD TO WORK OUT THIS WHOLE NEW DEAL WITH THE COUNTIES AND SO FORTH TO FIGURE OUT I JUST US AND WE DID A HEARING HE SAID THE WHOLE IF WE JUST. DELIVERED SERVICES THE WAY THEY ARE. JUST THE WAY THAT THE CURRENT LEVEL THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THEM. WE ARE GOING TO YOU KNOW THE JUST BECAUSE THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES. THE THE EXPENSE TO MAINTAIN SERVICE AT THE CURRENT LEVEL ACTUALLY IS GOING TO GROW FASTER NO GDP IN OUR STATE. BECAUSE OF THE AGING POPULATION MARIE SO. IF WE DON'T TRY TO CAN ADDRESS THIS THING [inaudible] NOW. WE WILL WE WILL BE SUFFERING THE IMPACT OF THAT -- ACTUALLY NOT TOO MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S WHY I'M DOING THIS BILL THIS IS THAT'S WHY THAT COALITION BEHIND IT WE NEED TO CREATE MORE OPTIONS. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT ALSO ALLOWS PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO AT MAINTAINED OR MIDDLE CLASS STATUS BE ALLOW PEOPLE DISABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO BE ACTIVE IN THE WORK FORCE AND SO FORTH. AND INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT THE ONLY OPTION IS SPEND DOWN TO MEDI CAL OUR STAY IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. THANK YOU. CAN I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON THAT THANK YOU UP FULL EXPLAINING. BASICALLY -- TO MAKE IT SHORT -- YOU STATED THAT THE CURRENT US THAT UP THE PROBLEM -- AND THIS L. TSS WOULD FIGURE OUT. HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM? DO YOU HAVE A ANY -- YOU'LL SOON -- IDEA THAT DO YOU YOU YOU CAN SUGGEST TO AS DSS. WHEN IS FORMED BECAUSE OF? ONCE WE CREATE THE SUCH OF BUREAUCRACY. IN ALL PROPER CF THE BUREAUCRACY. IS THIS IS THE PROBLEM THAT WE DON'T HAVE -- SUCH A BUREAUCRACY WE HAVE THIS KIND OF PROBLEM. IN ALL. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THIS WILL JUST OF KEEP ON ADDING THE PROBLEM TO THE CITIZENS THAT AND THE WE MAY END UP AND TO THOSE. IN THE SAME IN OUR PLACE TO WHERE WE ARE AT THE SO DO YOU HAVE BEEN IS UP IN A IF I MAY MAKE MY IDEA WHAT'S WHAT'S SHOULD BE CLEAR IS THAT THIS SETS UP THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS BENEFITS BOARD. THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS BENEFIT TRUST FUND AND THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM SERVICES A SPORTS ADVISORY COMMITTEE SO IT'S SETTING UP THE STRUCTURE. WOOD AND PROVIDES FOR THE FLEXIBILITY BUT DOCTOR PAT IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD AS A SHORT RESPONSE YEAH AND SO FOR FIRST OF BY THE WAY I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT -- WE PREVIOUSLY ALSO FUNDED A STUDY TO LOOK AT THE NEED AND DEMAND FOR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SO THAT WE DIDN'T COUPLE YEARS AGO -- PRIOR BUDGET USING CHEST SO WE'RE COLLECTING DATA BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY IS IS THAT -- LOOK WE'VE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. WE WE CURRENTLY ARE MEDI CAL SYSTEM WE ACTUALLY WE ACTUALLY TRIED DEPRIVE IT'S A TOTALLY PRIVATE SECTOR APPROACH THAT'S THE THE LONG TERMS. YEAH LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE THAT'S NOT WORKING THAT MARKET YOU KNOW INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE BANDING THAT MARKET THAT DIDN'T WORK. SO -- BUT WE HAVE THAT IN THE NEED AND SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT HOW CAN WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT PRIDE MAY INVOLVE SOCIALIZING SOME OF THE COSTS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. I WILL ALSO POINT OUT THAT -- THAT -- WE ACTUALLY WHAT PEOPLE GET OLDER THE ALTERNATIVE IS NOT REALLY FOR THAT YEAH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO AGE AND BE ABLE TO LEAD LIVES OF DIGNITY AND IF THEY NEEDS THOSE SUPPORTS TO BE ABLE. TO HAVE SOME OPTIONS TO GET THEM THE CAVS SOME ALTERNATIVES TO GET THOSE SUPPORTS. THAT'D THE SIDE FROM SPENDING DOWN THE POVERTY AND GOING ON MEDI CAL WHICH IS BY THE WAY WHICH WE'RE ALSO PAYING. FOR IS A PUBLIC ENTITY. THANK YOU DOCTOR. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. RIGHT BUT I AM REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE CREATION OF THIS ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- BRINGING IN THE CONSUMERS A CARE GIVERS PROVIDERS IN THE ADVOCATES I THINK WHEN WE HEAR HEAR FROM THE EXPERTS. I THINK DOCTOR CHOI YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON POINT WE NEED TO TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOLVE IT. BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING FOR IT ALREADY. AND SO. MAKING SURE THAT AT WE'RE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING WERE SETTING THIS ALL UP AND THIS IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT STEP SO I DO THANK YOU FOR FOR PROVIDING THIS. I DO WANT TO CONFIRM THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE AMENDMENTS YES VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible] THE THIRTY EIGHT IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS. AT THE OKAY THERE THERE. THANK YOU AND IN THE THE THE THEY WERE TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS STOCKARD CHANNING. OTHER I HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE A DISRESPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

ITEM NUMBER ONE SB ONE SEVEN TWO YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU ARE MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB ONE SEVEN TO HAS -- MULTIPLE PARTS ARE WITHIN THE BILL ALL RELATING TO INSURING FIREARMS ARE PROPERLY LOCKED AND STORED SECTION ONE ESTABLISHES THE KEEP OUR SENIOR SAFE. ACTIVE WOULD REQUIRE REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY. WHEN THE FACILITY ALLOWS RESIDENTS HAVE GUNS AND AMMUNITION THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE FACILITIES TO ACCEPT AMMUNITION OR FIREARMS BUT IT IF THEY CHOOSE TO ALLOW? WE WANT PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS AND STAFF THIS IS A VULNERABLE POPULATION AND AS SUCH WE WANT TO HAVE THESE LAYERS OF PROTECTION -- WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT PROTECTS RESIDENTS STAFF AND VISITORS FOR ENSURING ULTIMATE SAFETY AND I HAVE -- MONICA MILLER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA -- ADVOCATES FOR A REFORM WITH ME TODAY. THANK YOU. HI. THE MADAM CHAIR MONICA MILLER REPRESENTING CONSUMER ADVOCATES FOR RCMP REFORM IN AN RCF EITHER RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY. THEY WERE CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND THE INTENDED AS MUCH OF THE SIX BUT MODEL WHERE YOU HAVE A LOVED. ONE THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER CARE FOR HOME BUT YOU WANT TO NOT NECESSARILY INSTITUTIONALIZE THEM. SO THESE ARE FACILITIES WHERE IT'S IN SOMEONE'S HOME THEIR CARE GIVERS FAMILY VISITS. EXTRATERRESTRIAL ON WHEN MEMBERS GO INTO THESE FACILITIES THEY ARE ON THIS VISIT IT'S RESIDENTIAL BASED. SO THEY CAN TAKE WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH THEM AS LONG AS THE FACILITY ALLOWS IT TO THEY CAN'T TAKE A FIREARMS OR AMMUNITION ETCETERA. THAT THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO THIS MEASURE JUST SIMPLY SAYS AMONG OTHER THINGS THAT IFIN FACT THERE ARE FIRE ARMS ON THE PREMISES THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY STORED IN LOCKED IN THAT THERE'S NOTIFICATION. TO THAT EFFECT ON WHAT HAPPENS IS WE'VE DONE SOME CARRY. ON REQUESTS ALLEN PULLED FROM THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES WHEN THEY DO THEIR CHECKS ON THE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSURE. THAT ON THEY WALK IN AND THERE'S A GUN SITTING AT A DESK AND AMMUNITION EITHER RIGHT NEXT TO IT OR IN IN THAT IN THAT KIND AT THAT POINT. AND IT'S DANGEROUS TO CHILDREN TO FAMILY MEMBERS TO CARE GIVERS TO THE SOCIAL WORKERS SO IT'S SIMPLY JUST STANDARDIZING THAT AND ENSURING THAT THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY LOCKED IN STORE JUST LIKE YOU WOULD HAVE IN YOUR OWN HOME -- AT ANY QUESTIONS BUT WE URGE AN AYE VOTE TODAY AND THANK YOU.

BY A STEP IN THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS. SB FOUR NINETY WILL HELP PREVENT HUNGER AMONG LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED AND IN RECEIPT OF SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME BY REQUIRING THE COUNTY TOOK STAINED FROM COLLECTING. AND OVER ISSUE CALL FRESH BENEFIT FROM THEM IF THE OVER ISSUANCE WAS CAUSED BY COUNTY CARE. THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM KNOWN AS CONFESSION HERE IN THE STATE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ANTI HUNGER PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY. THAT HELPS LOW INCOME PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED WITH THE FOOD BASKET TO HELP THEM MEET THEIR BASIC FOOD NEEDS. AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES ARE AIDED BY SNAPPING ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CAL FIRST BENEFITS WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE PER MONTH HAVING BEEN HELPED BY FOOD BANK FOR FOOD DISTRIBUTIONS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE SP FOUR NINETY IS ALSO IN LINE WITH RECENT FEDERAL CHANGES WHICH A LINE THE CALPERS ELIGIBILITY A TRIFLED WITH FEDERAL SNAPPED ELIGIBILITY TRASH HOLDS. WITHOUT AS BEFORE NINETY CALIFORNIANS WITH PRECARIOUS HEALTH NEEDS ARE LIKELY TO GO HUNGRY MORE FREQUENTLY UNTIL.

AND IT'S A DOLLAR FORTY THREE PER MEAL ON AVERAGE. BEFORE JUNE OF THIS YEAR PEOPLE WHO ARE ELDERLY OR DISABLED AND RECEIVING SSI INCOME WERE INELIGIBLE. FOR EIGHT UNDER THE CALPERS PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF ACTION TAKEN BY THIS LEGISLATURE IN PEOPLE LEADERSHIP M. RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM. PEOPLE BEGAN TO RECEIVE CAL FRESH THROUGHOUT THE STATE IT IS LIFE CHANGING FOR THEM.

FOR AS SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION BENEFITS OR S. STI OR SOME OTHER FORM OF BENEFITS FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. WHEN THAT HAPPENED THE THE SENIORS?

TWO NINETEEN WE HAVE A MOTION -- AT A SECOND. GREAT MAY BEGIN. WHEN YOU ARE READY? WELL THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M I'M NOT HAS BEEN A LOT OF IT BUT I I DO HAVE. TWO PEOPLE HERE TO TESTIFY SO I THINK I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER THEM SO HAVE LUCY CARTER WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER. AND THEN SHE CAN INTRODUCE OUR OTHER GAS ACTUALLY LET'S START WITH QUITE A HI EVERYONE -- MY NAME IS QUITE A JOHNSON I'M A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY CAN YOU HEAR ME. OF STUDYING MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY WITH AN EMPHASIS IN GENETICS. AND A MINOR REASON LAW. SO CURRENTLY A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME I WORK IN A RESEARCH LAB. I SETTLE VASCULAR SURGEON I KIND OF DESIGN PROP PROGRAMS AND EVENTS FOR A CAMPUS ORG I HELP SPEARHEAD CALLED BLACK CUTIES FOR BLACK WE'RE INTRANSIGENCE AT CAL. ALSO RAN A CLOTHING BRAND COMPANY FOR INNER CITY YOUTH CALL JENNY YANG WHICH STANDS FOR YOUTH EMPOWERMENT AT WORK AND USE ADVOCATES AND NAVIGATING GROWTH. AND DO A LOT OF ART AND I CAN THE LIST GOES ON AND I KNOW IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT I DON'T SEE IT TO IMPRESS ANYONE IN THIS ROOM -- YOU SEE MANY PEOPLE ARE USUALLY IMPRESS WHICH IS GREAT BUT I'M NOT AS RARE AS MANY BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE ALL MY FOSTER SISTERS AND BROTHERS ARE CAPABLE OF MASTERING THEIR MANY TALENTS IF GRANTED AND PRESENTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. AND I ALL A LOT OF MY GREATEST POLICY QUALITIES AS A PERSON TO THE EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES I WAS BLESSED TO BE A PART OF AND I'M EVEN MORE THANKFUL FOR THE FOSTER PARENTS I'VE HAD THAT PUT IN THEIR OWN EFFORTS AND FUNDING TO SUPPORT. MY LOVE FOR ART MUSIC AND SCIENCE I SERIOUSLY DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD BE IF THEY DIDN'T DECIDE TO STEP UP AND GO THE EXTRA MILE -- AND HERE'S WHERE I BECOME INEVITABLE INEVITABLY PESSIMISTIC -- BECAUSE MY BROTHER AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER HE WASN'T AFFORDED THE SAME QUALITY CARE IS ME. A SOME OF THE FOSTER PARENTS HE WAS UNDER THE CARE OF DID THE BARE MINIMUM -- HE LOVES SPORTS BUT HEARD NO SO MANY TIMES WHEN IT CAME TO ASK. ASKING FOR MONEY US SUPPORT INTO GETTING INTO CAMPS AND GETTING FOOTBALL GEAR BECAUSE THE COST. AND FOREVER WHATEVER REASON THE FOSTER PARENTS DID NOT PROVIDE HELP IN GETTING HIM INTO ANYTHING HE REALLY WANTS TO GET INTO. AND THAT INCLUDES WRESTLING AND BOXING. SO. UNFORTUNATELY HE FOUND HIS BELONGING ELSEWHERE IN THE STREETS WHERE HE COULD PUT THAT ENERGY AND CURIOSITY TO USE -- AN IDOL I BELIEVE THAT HE'S. SMARTER OR YOU KNOW JUST AS SMART AS ME AND YET HIS STORY HAS A DIFFERENT OUTCOME DUE. TO THE DIFFERENCE IN CARE THAT HE RECEIVED -- LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRA MILES TAKEN ON BEHALF OF SOME OF MY CARE TAKERS BUT IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A TO LOOK THAT A YOUTH IS PLACE WITH SOMEONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF A CHILD PURSUE THEIR INCHES -- I FEEL LIKE ALL FOSTER PARENTS SHOULD HAVE THE SUPPORT IN THIS AREA SO THAT THE QUALITY OF THAT CHILD'S UPBRINGING IS IT LEFT UP TO CHANCE. AS I THINK BACK OUT ALL THE OUTLETS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO MY GREATEST QUALITIES ALSO REMEMBER THE LASTING FRIENDSHIPS AND SKILLS OF COMMUNICATION AND DRIVE FOR ADVOCACY THAT I'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM THOSE EXPERIENCES. NAY REALLY GROUNDS ME AND STABILIZES AND YOU STILL TO THIS DAY. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW FAR AWAY I MOVE AWAY. THOSE THINGS WILL ALWAYS MOVE WITH ME ITS STABILITY I CAN TAKE WITH ME ANYWHERE I GO. AND HONESTLY IS REALLY A SMALL PRICE TO PAY FOR SUCH A LONG TERM EFFECTS THAT TRULY SHAPE THE CHILD AND INSTILL WITH THEM THE DRIVE TO DEVELOP THEIR IDENTITY THEIR PASSION AND THEIR FRIENDSHIPS. IT SURE HELPED ME. AND IF WE STOP LEAVING IT UP TO CHANCE THAT A CHILD RECEIVES HELPING GETTING TO PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES OR THINGS THAT THEY LOVE TO DO. JUST IMAGINE HOW MANY CHILDREN WILL GET A FIGHTING CHANCE. TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN DESTINY. I LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT I'M NOT RARE. JUST A PRODUCT OF RARE QUALITY OF BRINGING. ANDACCOUNTABILITY IS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHEN YOU HAVE CONTROL AND SO FOR THESE REASONS ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT AS BE. TWO ONE NINE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE YES MY NAME IS LUCY SELFIE THE CARTER IN THE POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE YOUTH LAWCENTER AS YOU HEARD FROM MS JOHNSON EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE VITAL. THEY CAN BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GOOD AND BAD OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH THEY CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN GIVING FOSTER YOUTH THE SKILLS CONNECTIONS AND STABILITY. THAT WILL TAKE THEM BEYOND FOSTER CARE TWO HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE ADULTHOOD. THE RESEARCH FULLY SUPPORTS MISS JOHNSON STORY STUDIES SHOW THAT PARTICIPATION IN EXTRACURRICULAR IS HELP YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOP RESILIENCE. ACCOMPLISH IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL TASKS AND COUNTERACT THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF TRAUMA. IT RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS A PARTICIPATION IN EXTRACURRICULAR IS IMPROVED ACADEMIC OUTCOMES IT ALSO REDUCES YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN RISKY BEHAVIORS. EXTRACURRICULAR SO IMPORTANT FOR ALL YOUNG PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR FOSTER YOUTH WHO FACE TRAUMA INSTABILITY IN LOSS OF SUPPORT OF CONNECTIONS. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AS MISS JOHNSON POINTED OUT THEY'RE NOT AVAILABLE FROM MOST FOSTER YOUTH. IT'S THE LUCK OF THE DRAW WHETHER THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN A COUNTY THAT IS FIGURED OUT SOME EXTRA FUNDING FOR THIS. OR HAPPEN TO BE IN A FAMILY THAT CAN AFFORD IT. AND WE KNOW THAT EXTRA CURRICULAR AREN'T CHEAP. ALL OF US WHO ARE PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS IN THE ROOM. BALLET LESSONS SAT PREP MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THAT COST REAL MONEY AND FOSTER PARENTS DON'T HAVE THIS MONEY. SO SENATE BILL TWO ONE NINE WILL ALLOW FOR COUNTIES TO PILOT PROVIDING GRANTS TO FOSTER YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO THAT IT'S NOT LEFT UP TO CHANCE WHETHER THESE YOUTH CAN PARTICIPATE IN THESE ACTIVITIES. IT'S OUR HOPE THAT SB TWO ONE NINE WILL LEAD TO STATEWIDE SUPPORT DOWN THE ROAD SO THAT ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FOSTER YOUTH CAN PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR. CALIFORNIA LAWMAN DATES NORMALCY FOR ITS FOSTER YOUTH. THIS BILL HELPS ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S FOSTER YOUTH GET TO EXPERIENCE THIS VITAL PART OF A NORMAL CHILDHOOD. WE FOR CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT ON SOME OF THE BILL AMENDMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER STREAMLINED THE GRANT PROCESS SO THAT FOSTER YOUTH IN THE PILOT COUNTIES CAN GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES. SO FOR THESE REASONS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. IN MY HASTE TO GO THROUGH I'D I DO WANT TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL THEIR FINE WORK AND WE DO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THANK YOU THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY QUESTION.
