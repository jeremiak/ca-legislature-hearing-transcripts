I THINK THAT THAT THE PROPOSAL

00:36:32.357 --> 00:36:35.894 region:rollup2
ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WE DID ON

00:36:33.525 --> 00:36:37.195 region:rollup2
THE COST CONTEMPLATE THE CHANGES

00:36:35.894 --> 00:36:38.797 region:rollup2
THE EVIL BOOKS THAT NEW

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:41.366 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE COMING

00:36:38.797 --> 00:36:41.1000 region:rollup2
FORWARD THAT COUNTIES. I WILL BE

00:36:41.366 --> 00:36:43.568 region:rollup2
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT WITH THEM THE

00:36:41.1000 --> 00:36:45.804 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.871 region:rollup2
CHIEF ABOLISH ABOUT THAT.

00:36:45.804 --> 00:36:49.507 region:rollup2
I FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

00:36:46.871 --> 00:36:50.809 region:rollup2

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:53.144 region:rollup2
I ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER

00:36:50.809 --> 00:36:55.480 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:36:53.144 --> 00:36:57.315 region:rollup2
THAT IT MAKES SENSE FOR US AS A

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.983 region:rollup2
STATE TO LOOK AT A PUBLICLY

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:00.518 region:rollup2
OWNED OPEN SOURCE VOTING SYSTEM.

00:36:58.983 --> 00:37:01.853 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE MANY MEMBERS

00:37:00.518 --> 00:37:03.354 region:rollup2
OF THE PUBLIC WHO BELIEVE THAT

00:37:01.853 --> 00:37:05.423 region:rollup2
SUCH A SYSTEM COULD HELP SAVE

00:37:03.354 --> 00:37:06.357 region:rollup2
THE STATE AS WELL AS COUNTIES.

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:08.159 region:rollup2
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:09.394 region:rollup2

MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:16.034 region:rollup2
FUNDING FOR A MATCHING PROGRAM

00:37:14.265 --> 00:37:17.869 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP. AN OPEN SOURCE

00:37:16.034 --> 00:37:19.370 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:20.538 region:rollup2
FOR EVERY COUNTY TO USE.

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.439 region:rollup2

00:38:24.235 --> 00:38:24.969 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:38:24.469 --> 00:38:28.840 region:rollup2
AT THIS MOMENT

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:31.776 region:rollup2
IT IS.

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:32.911 region:rollup2
IT IT DEAD TELL ME WOULD EXPLAIN

FORWARD A AN OPEN SOURCE VOTING

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.849 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:38:36.681 --> 00:38:39.551 region:rollup2
THEY'RE IN THIS IT'S IT'S

00:38:37.849 --> 00:38:40.118 region:rollup2
OPEN ENDED IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT

TYPE OF SYSTEM ARE NOT IT I

00:38:40.118 --> 00:38:42.053 region:rollup2
WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT.

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.321 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S NO LIMITATION ON IT

00:38:42.053 --> 00:38:44.389 region:rollup2
SO I WOULD ANTICIPATE FOR

00:38:43.321 --> 00:38:47.825 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT IF.

00:38:44.389 --> 00:38:50.595 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES COUNTY WANTED TO

GET REIMBURSED FOR THAT

00:38:50.595 --> 00:38:52.530 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES THAT THEY'VE MADE

IN.

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.968 region:rollup2
AND IT CREATING THEIR BE SAP

00:38:55.233 --> 00:38:59.337 region:rollup2
HAD VOTING SYSTEM THAT THIS

00:38:56.968 --> 00:39:01.873 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REIMBURSABLE THROUGH

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:03.708 region:rollup2
THIS FUND OKAY AND AND AND WOOD.

00:39:01.873 --> 00:39:04.442 region:rollup2
WOULD YOUR AGENCY BE OPEN TO

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:06.811 region:rollup2
SOME SORT OF MATCHING PROGRAM

00:39:04.442 --> 00:39:08.513 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO COUNTIES TO HELP

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:09.347 region:rollup2
DEVELOP.

00:39:08.513 --> 00:39:10.982 region:rollup2
AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM WILL BE

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:13.351 region:rollup2
OPEN TO ANY CONSIDERATION.

00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:14.852 region:rollup2
I APPRECIATE THAT I CERTAINLY

00:39:13.351 --> 00:39:15.620 region:rollup2
KNOW SPEAKING FOR FOR MY CITY OF

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:17.088 region:rollup2

TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND ARE

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:19.624 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE ESTIMATING

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.725 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEM IS LIKELY TO BE

00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:22.694 region:rollup2
OBSOLETE

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:24.629 region:rollup2
BY TWENTY TWENTY SO THIS IS

00:39:22.694 --> 00:39:24.929 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY. HAS EMERGENCY FOR FOR

00:39:24.629 --> 00:39:26.097 region:rollup2
MY COUNTY.

00:39:24.929 --> 00:39:28.266 region:rollup2
BUT I ALSO KNOW I THINK THE

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:30.068 region:rollup2
IDEA OF AN OPEN SOURCE SYSTEM IS

00:39:28.266 --> 00:39:31.102 region:rollup2
ONE THAT HAS. A LOT OF APPEAL

00:39:30.068 --> 00:39:32.937 region:rollup2
FOR A LOT OF REASONS FROM A

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:34.739 region:rollup2
FISCAL STANDPOINT FROM A

00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:36.507 region:rollup2
SECURITY STANDPOINT FROM A. UP

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:37.609 region:rollup2
FROM A FROM A TRANSPARENCY

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:40.078 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT SO CERTAINLY

00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:40.912 region:rollup2
SOMETHING I'M INTERESTED IN AND

00:39:40.078 --> 00:39:42.313 region:rollup2
AND WORKING ON AND I KNOW I'VE

00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:45.383 region:rollup2

ABSOLUTELY DO ANY COMMENTS ON

00:39:51.356 --> 00:39:54.559 region:rollup2

SOURCE SYSTEM.

00:40:01.633 --> 00:40:03.501 region:rollup2

SOURCE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:05.870 region:rollup2

THIS PROPOSAL. IT'S ABOUT A

00:40:33.064 --> 00:40:37.535 region:rollup2
QUARTER OF THOSE COUNTIES WHICH.

00:40:35.667 --> 00:40:39.370 region:rollup2
CHARACTERIZED AS HAVING FIFTY

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:41.139 region:rollup2
PRECINCTS OR FEWER. AND OUR

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.041 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE DOLLAR

00:40:41.139 --> 00:40:44.809 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:40:43.041 --> 00:40:46.411 region:rollup2

CENTER OR POLLING PLACE FOR

00:40:46.411 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
THOSE SMALLER COUNTIES. IS NOT

00:40:48.479 --> 00:40:50.715 region:rollup2
MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THEM THE

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:52.784 region:rollup2
ECONOMIES OF SCALE ASSOCIATED

TO THE SAME DEGREE FOR THOSE

00:40:54.285 --> 00:41:01.225 region:rollup2
SMALLER COUNTIES.

00:40:55.019 --> 00:41:03.428 region:rollup2

BILL. IN.

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:19.956 region:rollup2
DUE TO THEIR AGE OR THEIR

PROVIDE RESIDENTS WITH.

01:09:21.424 --> 01:09:25.194 region:rollup2
HIGH LEVELS OF CARE AND THEN

ALSO JUST THE COORDINATION OF

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.563 region:rollup2
THEIR EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES IS

01:09:26.896 --> 01:09:30.033 region:rollup2

AND DO WE AGREE THAT THIS DOES

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:33.703 region:rollup2
PRESENT AN ISSUE I THINK ARC

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.071 region:rollup2
MAIN CONCERNS REVOLVE AROUND THE

ONLY WHAT CURRENT NEEDS ARE BUT

01:09:45.848 --> 01:09:49.552 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO FUTURE DEMANDS WITHIN

01:09:47.316 --> 01:09:50.853 region:rollup2
THE VETERANS HOMES. SO THAT THE

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:53.322 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE CAN USE THAT AS A

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:55.925 region:rollup2
TOOL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:57.260 region:rollup2
PRIORITIZE FUTURE CHANGES WITHIN

BE IT NEAR TERM OR THE LONG TERM

01:10:09.806 --> 01:10:12.608 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT.

01:10:10.273 --> 01:10:13.643 region:rollup2

GENERAL.

01:10:15.745 --> 01:10:18.081 region:rollup2
IT A LACK OF A MASTER PLAN

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:20.550 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:22.118 region:rollup2
RAISES SOME INITIAL QUESTIONS

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.552 region:rollup2
THAT JUST AREN'T ANSWERED QUITE

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:24.721 region:rollup2

THOSE QUESTIONS REALLY REVOLVED

01:10:25.788 --> 01:10:29.826 region:rollup2
AROUND ONE. HOUSE THE

01:10:27.623 --> 01:10:32.428 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION PROJECTING THAT

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:33.696 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED CAPACITY OF THESE

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:35.698 region:rollup2
NEW FACILITIES WHICH MAINLY

01:10:33.696 --> 01:10:36.599 region:rollup2
WOULD JUST REPLACE.

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.867 region:rollup2
THE CURRENT FACILITY OF SPENT

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:40.303 region:rollup2
YOUNG FELLA WOULDN'T NECESSARILY

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:42.105 region:rollup2
EXPAND CAPACITY ON IS THE BEST

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:43.873 region:rollup2
SIZE TO NOT ONLY MEET CURRENT

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:46.509 region:rollup2
DEMAND BUT ALSO FUTURE DEMAND.

01:10:43.873 --> 01:10:48.077 region:rollup2
ALSO ARE THERE OTHER PLANS I'M

01:10:46.509 --> 01:10:49.612 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THIS ONE TO

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:51.047 region:rollup2

HIGHER UNMET NEEDS WITHIN THE

01:10:58.054 --> 01:11:02.191 region:rollup2
CALM CALVET SYSTEM AND ANOTHER

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.860 region:rollup2
QUESTION TO JUST LOOKING FORWARD

01:11:02.191 --> 01:11:06.329 region:rollup2
THERE SEEMS TO BE TO AT TIMES

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.396 region:rollup2
COMPETING. PRIORITIES AT PLAY

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:08.498 region:rollup2
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CALVET

01:11:07.396 --> 01:11:10.333 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ONE IS YOU WANT TO

01:11:08.498 --> 01:11:12.001 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN CAPACITY IN ORDER TO

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:13.102 region:rollup2
MEET CURRENT NEEDS. BUT ANOTHER

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:14.904 region:rollup2
AND YOU ALSO WANT TO EXPAND

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:17.473 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IN LIGHT OF ANY FUTURE

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:18.641 region:rollup2
DEMAND OR UNMET NEED THAT WE

01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:20.343 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SEE IN IT SEEMS LIKE

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:22.145 region:rollup2
THIS PROPOSAL IS ON THE SIDE OF

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:23.980 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING CAPACITY.

01:11:22.145 --> 01:11:24.947 region:rollup2
BUT LACK OF MASTER PLAN IT'S

01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.349 region:rollup2
REALLY UNCLEAR WHAT ARE THE

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:28.117 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED TRADE OFFS OF

01:11:26.349 --> 01:11:30.019 region:rollup2
MAINTAINING CAPACITY AS OPPOSED

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:32.355 region:rollup2
TO EXPANDING CAPACITY IN THE

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:34.457 region:rollup2
NEAR TERM. AND IS THERE A LONG

01:11:32.355 --> 01:11:36.626 region:rollup2
TERM THAN PLANNED TO GET UP THAT

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:38.294 region:rollup2
EXPANDED CAPACITY ISSUE AND FOR

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:40.463 region:rollup2
THOSE REASONS WE RECOMMEND THAT

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:42.198 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE DELAY THE CHECK

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.833 region:rollup2
THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE

01:11:42.198 --> 01:11:44.934 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT THAT VETERAN HOMES. FOR

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:45.701 region:rollup2
THE END WITHIN THE VETERAN HOME

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:48.037 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:11:45.701 --> 01:11:48.971 region:rollup2

QUESTIONS.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:57.046 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER ISSUES AROUND TO

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:58.247 region:rollup2
THIS POTENTIALLY IS ALSO AN

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:00.283 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:11:58.247 --> 01:12:03.753 region:rollup2

ENOUGH THAT SOMETHING OF

01:12:16.399 --> 01:12:19.168 region:rollup2
INTEREST THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:21.370 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:23.372 region:rollup2
IN THIS LONG TERM MASTER PLAN

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:25.975 region:rollup2
CONCEPT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT.

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:27.944 region:rollup2
YOU COULD ADD AS AN OBJECTIVE

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:32.875 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT.

01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:34.810 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED TO THREE HUNDRED IS

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.478 region:rollup2
IS ABOUT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT SO

01:13:34.810 --> 01:13:37.079 region:rollup2
OUR OUR.

01:13:35.478 --> 01:13:38.581 region:rollup2
THAT THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:40.616 region:rollup2
PROPOSING REFLECTS.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:41.417 region:rollup2
SOME INTERNAL ANALYSIS THAT

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:42.485 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IT REFLECTS THE

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:44.987 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS DONE A TWO THOUSAND

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:46.622 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN AND IT DOES REPLACE THE

01:13:44.987 --> 01:13:48.024 region:rollup2
EXISTING SNIFFED BUILDING. THE

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:50.092 region:rollup2
EXISTING STAFF BUILDING IS AN

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:52.928 region:rollup2
EXTRAORDINARILY POOR.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:54.664 region:rollup2
CONDITION AT ANY GIVEN TIME ANY

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:57.266 region:rollup2
OF OUR CONTROL AGENCIES PUBLIC

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:59.468 region:rollup2
HEALTH CMS YOU STV A CAN GOING

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.803 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE US FOR ANY NUMBER OF

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:02.371 region:rollup2
THINGS YET THEY UNDERSTAND THE

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:04.240 region:rollup2
SITUATION THEY DON'T GO SO FAR

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:06.142 region:rollup2
AS TO SAY THIS IS UNFIT. FOR

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.243 region:rollup2
LIVING BUT THEY DO CALL US OUT

01:14:06.142 --> 01:14:08.911 region:rollup2
SO AT ANY GIVEN TIME WERE

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.279 region:rollup2
THROWING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY HALF

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:12.581 region:rollup2
A MILLION DOLLARS AT ANY.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:13.783 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF REPAIRS

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:16.385 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.953 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT REGARDLESS OF THE

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:18.654 region:rollup2
ANALYSIS THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:21.123 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:23.159 region:rollup2
THE THE END RESULT WILL BE A

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:24.794 region:rollup2
NEED FOR A NEW STAFF BUILDING AT

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.996 region:rollup2
THE OUTFIELD VETERANS HOME. ON

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:28.631 region:rollup2
THAT IF YOU WERE TO DELAY THIS

01:14:26.996 --> 01:14:29.865 region:rollup2
THE THE FACT THAT WE ARE HERE

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:32.902 region:rollup2
TODAY IS.

01:14:29.865 --> 01:14:34.403 region:rollup2
EVER SINCE I BEGAN IT CAL THAT

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:35.638 region:rollup2
WHICH IS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:37.306 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FORWARD WITH

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.007 region:rollup2
A REQUEST FOR A NEW SNIFFED

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.976 region:rollup2
BUILDING.

01:14:38.007 --> 01:14:43.312 region:rollup2
THERE IS MOMENTUM AT STAKE.

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:45.181 region:rollup2
GETTING STAKEHOLDERS TO.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:47.316 region:rollup2
TO BUY OFF ON THE IDEA GETTING

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:48.918 region:rollup2
THE U. S. DEVIATE TOO ACCEPTED

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:51.454 region:rollup2
GRANT AND ACCEPT THAT GRANT LAST

01:14:48.918 --> 01:14:53.055 region:rollup2
WEEK WE JUST UPDATED OUR PRE

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:55.057 region:rollup2
APPLICATION WITH U. S. DBA. TO

01:14:53.055 --> 01:14:57.460 region:rollup2
STAY WITHIN THEIR BUDGET CYCLE

01:14:55.057 --> 01:14:59.729 region:rollup2
SO IT'S NOT JUST.

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.197 region:rollup2
ALLOWING FOR THIS EXERCISE TO

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:03.466 region:rollup2
OCCUR AND PUTTING THAT THEN BACK

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:04.800 region:rollup2
IN PLACE AFTER FIFTEEN MONTHS

01:15:03.466 --> 01:15:06.535 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO DELAY IT MUCH

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.003 region:rollup2
LONGER THAN THAT BECAUSE OF THE

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:09.739 region:rollup2
THE MOMENTUM PROCESS THAT HAS TO

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:11.741 region:rollup2
OCCUR.

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:13.609 region:rollup2
SO SELECT CREEK THE ARGUMENT IS

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:15.878 region:rollup2
THE SIZE THE FACILITY WILL NOT

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:17.346 region:rollup2
CHANGE RUN THAT TO LEARN WITH A

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:19.081 region:rollup2
TUNER FORTY BED MAXIMUM. THAT

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:21.083 region:rollup2
DOES SO THAT'S THE PROPOSAL THAT

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:22.818 region:rollup2
WERE WERE MAKING WE FEEL BASED

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:24.286 region:rollup2
ON SOME OF THE EVALUATIONS THAT

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:26.021 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE ENVIRONMENTALLY AND

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:27.623 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH THAT THAT'S THE

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.691 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE NUMBER THEY'LL HAVE

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:30.025 region:rollup2
TO BE AN ENVIRONMENTAL

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:32.161 region:rollup2
EVALUATION DONE ON THE ENTIRE

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:34.430 region:rollup2
PROPERTY TO. TO ADDRESS THIS SO

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:36.699 region:rollup2
EVEN THAT WILL WILL TAKE INTO

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:38.434 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION THE SIGNS. ON THE

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:40.970 region:rollup2
STATE HA HISTORIC PRESERVATION

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:42.571 region:rollup2
OFFICE WILL WILL COMMENT ON THE

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:44.306 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATESIZE IT HAS TO MATCH

01:15:42.571 --> 01:15:45.908 region:rollup2
THE EXISTING STRUCTURE BECAUSE

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:47.643 region:rollup2
THE FACILITIES SO ALL. THERE ARE

01:15:45.908 --> 01:15:50.980 region:rollup2
SO MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IN

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:51.514 region:rollup2
PLAY OTHER JUST AN ANALYSIS THAT

01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.516 region:rollup2
COMES BACK AND SAYS.

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:55.651 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT'S NECESSARY AT THIS

01:15:53.516 --> 01:15:56.986 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR TIME ARE SYSTEM WIDE.

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:58.454 region:rollup2
OTHER LARGER SNIFF AUTHORITIES

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:00.322 region:rollup2
IN THE COUNTRY.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:00.856 region:rollup2
OR DOES IT SO SO THAT'S A GREAT

01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:02.725 region:rollup2
QUESTION.

01:16:00.856 --> 01:16:04.060 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN THE NINETY FIVE

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:05.127 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ALL THE SENATE

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:06.729 region:rollup2
FACILITIES CROSS COUNTRY TO

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:08.064 region:rollup2
HONOR BETTER LESS

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.265 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A FIVE PERCENT THAT

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:10.1000 region:rollup2
ARE A LITTLE SO. WE ARE THE

01:16:09.265 --> 01:16:12.468 region:rollup2
LARGEST

01:16:10.1000 --> 01:16:13.936 region:rollup2
WE ARE NOW THAT THE LARGEST I

01:16:12.468 --> 01:16:15.805 region:rollup2
MEAN WHEN YOU LOOK IN IN

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:17.673 region:rollup2
COMPARISON AND SCOPE OF SIZE.

01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:19.675 region:rollup2
IS IT IS A REALLY APPLES APPLES

01:16:17.673 --> 01:16:20.609 region:rollup2
COMPARISON THERE WAS AB ITS OR

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.143 region:rollup2
IT IF IT'S NOT A SELL OT IS THE

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:22.478 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WANNA DO IS WHEN

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:23.813 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED THAT THE NEED THE

01:16:22.478 --> 01:16:25.414 region:rollup2
AUDIENCE THE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:16:23.813 --> 01:16:25.948 region:rollup2
BE IN THE NEXT FIVE TEN TWENTY

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:28.350 region:rollup2
YEARS WE WANT TO BUILD. A

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.984 region:rollup2
FACILITY THAT'S TOO LARGE THAT

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:29.685 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE THE AUDIENCE ON THE

01:16:28.984 --> 01:16:31.287 region:rollup2
OTHER HAND.

01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:33.155 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WITH ANY

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:34.890 region:rollup2
OF. ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION OR ANY

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:36.092 region:rollup2
SITE LOCATION IS IS GOING TO BE

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:37.426 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY SO

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.428 region:rollup2
IF YOU PUT A FIVE HUNDRED BED

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:40.896 region:rollup2
FACILITY IN THE NAPA COUNTY

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.231 region:rollup2
BURDEN THE ALPHA HOME THAT'S.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:43.165 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA OVERWHELM DID THE

01:16:42.231 --> 01:16:44.633 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE THE ABILITY TO%

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:45.434 region:rollup2
TAKE CARE OF THAT AND THAT'S WHY

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:47.169 region:rollup2
WHEN DAVE SAID THAT THEY'VE PUT

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.970 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THOUGHT AND AND ENERGY

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:50.239 region:rollup2
INTO.

01:16:47.970 --> 01:16:51.841 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT WILL WHAT WILL WORK

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:53.042 region:rollup2
THERE? IT SO HAPPENS TO BE

01:16:51.841 --> 01:16:55.444 region:rollup2
FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:56.779 region:rollup2
HAVE NOW.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.179 region:rollup2
THE THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:59.181 region:rollup2
ADD IS THAT THE.

01:16:57.179 --> 01:17:00.916 region:rollup2
.

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:01.450 region:rollup2
THE REQUEST FOR PERFORMANCE

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:03.853 region:rollup2
CRITERIA.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:06.388 region:rollup2
SATISFIES A STANDARD.

01:17:03.853 --> 01:17:08.524 region:rollup2
SO THAT THE STANDARD BY WHICH

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:10.659 region:rollup2
THE THE FACILITY WILL BE BUILT.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:12.394 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER IS IRRELEVANT.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:14.130 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER CAN ALWAYS BE

01:17:12.394 --> 01:17:15.731 region:rollup2
ADJUSTED SO WE WOULD

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.466 region:rollup2
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:18.934 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA BE ALLOWED

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:21.871 region:rollup2
TO CONTINUE IN PARALLEL WITH THE

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:22.538 region:rollup2
MASTER PLAN.

01:17:21.871 --> 01:17:23.873 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY RETARDED REP OF THE

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:25.207 region:rollup2
NUMBER CAN BE ADJUSTED SO

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:27.877 region:rollup2
THERE'S. THERE'S ENOUGH

01:17:25.207 --> 01:17:28.811 region:rollup2
SPACE TO TO BUILD OUTER. REFER

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.546 region:rollup2
ADDITIONS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:32.681 region:rollup2
WHAT MS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:34.683 region:rollup2
THAT THE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:36.151 region:rollup2
AND THE NUMBER OF OF THE TWO

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:38.554 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FORTY BED.

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.022 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL COULD BE ADJUSTED TO

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:42.024 region:rollup2
BE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE MASTER

01:17:40.022 --> 01:17:43.626 region:rollup2
PLAN NEED AT THE END OF THAT

01:17:42.024 --> 01:17:45.361 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN MONTH PERIOD. ALL I'M

01:17:43.626 --> 01:17:47.096 region:rollup2
SUGGESTING IS THAT WE SEE THAT

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:48.697 region:rollup2
AS POTENTIALLY A COMPROMISE THAT

01:17:47.096 --> 01:17:50.432 region:rollup2
ALLOWS BOTH TO CONTINUE IN

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:51.500 region:rollup2
PARALLEL WE RESPECT THE FACT

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:52.968 region:rollup2
THAT THE THE.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.837 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE A MASTER

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:55.504 region:rollup2
PLAN DONE ON A SYSTEM WIDE BASIS

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:57.640 region:rollup2
WE DON'T.

01:17:55.504 --> 01:18:00.309 region:rollup2
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT BUT WE

01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:02.578 region:rollup2
SEE THAT BOTH PROPOSALS CAN GO

01:18:00.309 --> 01:18:04.180 region:rollup2
FORWARD IN PARALLEL NOT LINEAR

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:05.915 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY'RE PUT IN TO A

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:07.516 region:rollup2
LINEAR FASHION. WHAT YOU'RE

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:09.118 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE IS A MUCH LONGER

01:18:07.516 --> 01:18:10.452 region:rollup2
DELAY THAN SIMPLY JUST FIFTEEN

01:18:09.118 --> 01:18:11.520 region:rollup2
MONTHS FOR AN ANALYSIS TO BE

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:14.190 region:rollup2
DONE?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:15.257 region:rollup2
OKAY A FINANCE.

01:18:14.190 --> 01:18:16.325 region:rollup2
YES DAHLE LOOKING BUILT PARTNER

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:17.126 region:rollup2
FINANCE SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:18:16.325 --> 01:18:18.727 region:rollup2
REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE

01:18:17.126 --> 01:18:20.329 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ON THIS PROPOSAL FOR

01:18:18.727 --> 01:18:21.664 region:rollup2
SOMETIME NOW. AND WE FEEL

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:23.399 region:rollup2
STRONGLY THAT SUPPORT TO MOVE

01:18:21.664 --> 01:18:24.199 region:rollup2
FORWARD WITH IT AT THIS TIME AS

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:25.534 region:rollup2
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:18:24.199 --> 01:18:27.136 region:rollup2
IT'S THE TO

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:29.672 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT ALREADY STATED.

01:18:27.136 --> 01:18:31.140 region:rollup2
HALDERMAN HOSPITAL HAS UP SOME

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:32.608 region:rollup2
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONAL

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:34.610 region:rollup2
AND FUNCTIONAL FOUND

01:18:32.608 --> 01:18:36.212 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES NOT TO MENTION A

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.680 region:rollup2
FIRE LIKE SAFETY DEFICIENCIES.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE AND UNDERSTAND THAT

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.883 region:rollup2
THE MASTER PLAN MIGHT DELIVER.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
SOME FINDINGS THAT THE

01:18:40.883 --> 01:18:44.220 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION A ONE ACT ON IT

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.821 region:rollup2
SOME SOME LATER DATE.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.957 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:50.359 region:rollup2
IT IT CONSIDERS THE CONDITION OF

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:51.427 region:rollup2
THE HALDERMAN FACILITY IT IT IS

01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:52.628 region:rollup2
GOING TO COME TO THE SAME

01:18:51.427 --> 01:18:54.363 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION WHICH IS THAT THAT.

01:18:52.628 --> 01:18:55.564 region:rollup2
FACILITY NEEDS TO BE REPLACED

01:18:54.363 --> 01:18:57.833 region:rollup2
THE SAME CONCLUSION AS THE

I'M SO THE MAIN RATIONALE BEHIND

01:26:15.604 --> 01:26:18.940 region:rollup2
THIS RECOMMENDATION. I IS THAT

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:20.142 region:rollup2
IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE BUREAU

01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:22.677 region:rollup2

01:26:20.142 --> 01:26:24.012 region:rollup2

IT WAS. MOSTLY AT REAL ESTATE OR

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.952 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT

AFFECTED MORE BOARDS AND

01:26:30.952 --> 01:26:33.355 region:rollup2
BUREAUS.

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:35.090 region:rollup2
I'M SO IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:37.626 region:rollup2
BACKGROUND ON THE ISSUE ON THE

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:38.960 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF CROSS SUBSIDIZATION AND

01:26:37.626 --> 01:26:40.028 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ABOUT PERRETTA HAVE

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.831 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE LONG

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:43.765 region:rollup2
STANDING OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS

01:26:42.831 --> 01:26:45.500 region:rollup2

BEEN CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT THIS

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:52.574 region:rollup2
ISSUE I'M SO IT'S NOT A NEW

01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:53.241 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

01:26:52.574 --> 01:26:55.911 region:rollup2
.

01:26:53.241 --> 01:26:57.913 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

01:26:55.911 --> 01:27:00.716 region:rollup2
I'M A PRETTY THIS REALLY ARISES

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:02.317 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY THE DEPARTMENT I'M

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:04.052 region:rollup2
ASSESSES ITS CHARGES ON A

01:27:02.317 --> 01:27:04.986 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. BUT RIGHT

01:27:04.052 --> 01:27:06.054 region:rollup2
DEFERRED PURCHASE INCLUDING

POSITION BASED.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:10.192 region:rollup2
APPROACHES IT'S NOT CLEAR IF A

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:10.859 region:rollup2
POSITION ALLOCATION THAT THOSE

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:12.194 region:rollup2
ARE THE POSITIONS AT THE BOARDS

01:27:10.859 --> 01:27:14.596 region:rollup2
AND HEROES IF THAT'S REALLY

01:27:12.194 --> 01:27:15.063 region:rollup2
REFLECTIVE OF THE WORKLOAD THAT

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.865 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE FROM THE

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:18.867 region:rollup2

OF PRO RATA THAT WAS BEING A

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.604 region:rollup2
FAST ON THE BUREAU OF REAL

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:24.072 region:rollup2
ESTATE WAS ONE OF THE MAIN

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:25.140 region:rollup2
RATIONALES BEHIND THIS

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:26.475 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION TO MOVE THEM OUT OF

01:27:25.140 --> 01:27:27.809 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:29.277 region:rollup2
AND.

01:27:27.809 --> 01:27:30.879 region:rollup2
IN FACT THAT RELATIVELY HIGH

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:31.947 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF PER RATHER THAT THEY

01:27:30.879 --> 01:27:33.949 region:rollup2
WERE PAYING.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:35.417 region:rollup2
IS REFLECTED AS HE SAID IN THE

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:36.885 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THAT YOU SEE.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:39.020 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY IN SEVENTEEN

01:27:36.885 --> 01:27:40.622 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN OTHER BUREAU WAS PAYING

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:43.158 region:rollup2
ABOUT FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:45.026 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN PRO RATA HOWEVER I

01:27:43.158 --> 01:27:46.361 region:rollup2
HAD THEM THAT PROPOSAL

01:27:45.026 --> 01:27:47.829 region:rollup2
REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANTLY

01:27:46.361 --> 01:27:49.030 region:rollup2
SMALLER REDUCTION IN THEIR

01:27:47.829 --> 01:27:50.499 region:rollup2
BUDGET EVEN ACCOUNTING FOR APRIL

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:52.501 region:rollup2
LETTER.

01:27:50.499 --> 01:27:53.168 region:rollup2
WE WOULD NOTICIAS PROVIDED SOME

01:27:52.501 --> 01:27:54.770 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN

01:27:53.168 --> 01:27:56.371 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS THAT

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.507 region:rollup2
WE'VE RAISED INCLUDING I THINK I

01:27:56.371 --> 01:27:59.040 region:rollup2
AM A VERY RECENTLY UPDATED.

01:27:58.507 --> 01:28:01.576 region:rollup2
DOCUMENT.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:03.178 region:rollup2
BUT WE STILL THINK.

01:28:01.576 --> 01:28:05.180 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:28:03.178 --> 01:28:06.915 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW WIDESPREAD

01:28:05.180 --> 01:28:08.917 region:rollup2
THIS CROSS SUBSIDIZATION IS

01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:10.385 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S JUST RELATED TO TO

01:28:08.917 --> 01:28:11.586 region:rollup2
THE BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE OR

01:28:10.385 --> 01:28:13.321 region:rollup2
WHETHER THIS IS REALLY I'M I'M

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:15.056 region:rollup2
MORE WIDESPREAD ISSUE. UP AND

01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:15.724 region:rollup2
SAID WE THINK SOME OF THOSE.

01:28:15.056 --> 01:28:17.459 region:rollup2
STILL DEFINITELY NEED TO BE

01:28:15.724 --> 01:28:19.060 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED OUR RECOMMENDATION

01:28:17.459 --> 01:28:20.929 region:rollup2
WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:22.397 region:rollup2
OTHER REPORTS WOULD ALLOW THE

01:28:20.929 --> 01:28:23.732 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO BETTER ASSESS

01:28:22.397 --> 01:28:25.200 region:rollup2
THIS LEVEL OF CROSS OF CITIES

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:28.003 region:rollup2
SUBSIDIZATION AND DETERMINE

01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:29.070 region:rollup2
WHETHER. ANY OTHER METHODOLOGIES

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:30.806 region:rollup2
USED FOR ALLOCATING COSTS.

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:32.674 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND WITH REGARD TO

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:34.676 region:rollup2
THE APRIL FIRST LETTER. WE

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:36.278 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT DCA THAT BE AT

01:28:34.676 --> 01:28:37.612 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE PREVIEW CA'S

01:28:36.278 --> 01:28:39.347 region:rollup2
REQUESTED REDUCTIONS FOR

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:41.349 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN.

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:43.485 region:rollup2
BUT NOT APPROVE THAT REQUESTED

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:44.686 region:rollup2
IT REDUCTIONS FOR THE OUT YEARS

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:46.154 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT.

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:47.756 region:rollup2
INSTEAD HOW THE DEPARTMENT COME

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:48.824 region:rollup2
BACK IN REQUEST THOSE AT A

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:50.158 region:rollup2
FUTURE DATE.

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.893 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:53.361 region:rollup2
INDICATE THAT IT BELIEVES THAT

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:54.696 region:rollup2
IT CAN MAKE THESE REDUCTIONS

01:28:53.361 --> 01:28:56.164 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AFFECTING THE SERVICE

01:28:54.696 --> 01:28:57.766 region:rollup2
LEVELS PROVIDED TO THE OTHER

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:59.234 region:rollup2
BOARDS AND BUREAUS. HOWEVER IT'S

01:28:57.766 --> 01:29:00.302 region:rollup2
NOT CLEAR TO US THAT THIS IS

01:28:59.234 --> 01:29:02.037 region:rollup2
CASE AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE

01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:03.638 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS YET TO IDENTIFY

01:29:02.037 --> 01:29:05.373 region:rollup2
THE SPECIFIC POSITIONS THAT WILL

01:29:03.638 --> 01:29:06.975 region:rollup2
BE REDUCED.

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:08.443 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE DOESN'T HAVE A

01:29:06.975 --> 01:29:10.579 region:rollup2
GOOD SENSE OF.

01:29:08.443 --> 01:29:12.714 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC WAYS THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:29:10.579 --> 01:29:14.583 region:rollup2
CHANGE ITS OPERATIONS WHETHER

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:15.517 region:rollup2
IT'S GONNA HOW IT CAN ABSORB THE

01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:16.851 region:rollup2
WORKLOAD THOSE FOLKS WERE DOING

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.720 region:rollup2
OR REDISTRIBUTED ARE REALLY WHAT

01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:20.188 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.790 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE THINK BY TAKING THIS

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.258 region:rollup2
APPROACH IN JUST APPROVING THE

01:29:21.790 --> 01:29:25.126 region:rollup2
FIRST YEAR IT WILL ALLOW THE

01:29:23.258 --> 01:29:27.262 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO REVISIT THOSE.

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:29.798 region:rollup2
THAT'S THESE REDUCTIONS IN A

01:29:27.262 --> 01:29:31.266 region:rollup2
FEW KEY IT NEXT YEAR BASICALLY

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:32.467 region:rollup2
HOW THE DEPARTMENT COME BACK

01:29:31.266 --> 01:29:34.202 region:rollup2
THEY CAN REPORT ON THE EFFECTS

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:35.937 region:rollup2
OF THESE REDUCTIONS ON WHICH

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:37.138 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THE ELIMINATED WITH

01:29:35.937 --> 01:29:37.939 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS WORK AS WELL AS

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:39.541 region:rollup2
WHICH POSITIONS THEY'RE

01:29:37.939 --> 01:29:41.943 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE IN FUTURE

01:29:39.541 --> 01:29:43.812 region:rollup2
YEARS. I MEAN WE ALSO THINK THAT

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.479 region:rollup2
THE WORKLOAD INFORMATION THAT

01:29:43.812 --> 01:29:46.481 region:rollup2
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THEY

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:48.216 region:rollup2
COLLECT COULD BE VERY VALUABLE

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:49.551 region:rollup2
IN FUTURE YEARS FOR INFORMING.

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.286 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE DECISION MAKING

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:52.220 region:rollup2

SUPPORT THE CURRENT STRUCTURE

01:30:10.372 --> 01:30:13.842 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE IT'S AN

01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:15.844 region:rollup2
EQUITABLE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE

01:30:13.842 --> 01:30:17.445 region:rollup2
ACOSTA BOARDS AND BUREAUS FOR

01:30:15.844 --> 01:30:19.714 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:21.716 region:rollup2
WE FEEL THAT THIS PROVIDES

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:23.184 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT AND ACCESS TO ALL THE

01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:25.720 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES WITHOUT

01:30:23.184 --> 01:30:28.390 region:rollup2
pWITHOUT.

01:30:25.720 --> 01:30:30.659 region:rollup2
INCREASING COSTS TO DEPARTMENTS.

01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:31.459 region:rollup2
I DO WANT TO NOTE A COUPLE OF

01:30:30.659 --> 01:30:34.129 region:rollup2
POINTS THAT.

01:30:31.459 --> 01:30:36.531 region:rollup2
DC IS CENTRALIZED SERVICES.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:38.533 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM ARE TRACKED.

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:40.936 region:rollup2
AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:42.537 region:rollup2
ON AN BONTA USE BASIS THE

01:30:40.936 --> 01:30:44.673 region:rollup2
REMAINING SERVICES ARE CHARGED.

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:46.808 region:rollup2
AS PRO RATA BASED ON THE NUMBER

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:50.145 region:rollup2
OF POSITIONS BECAUSE THOSE.

01:30:46.808 --> 01:30:51.613 region:rollup2
POLICY SERVICES CAN'T ALWAYS BE

01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:52.280 region:rollup2
ATTRIBUTED TOOK FROM ONE BORDER

01:30:51.613 --> 01:30:53.882 region:rollup2
BUREAU.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:56.284 region:rollup2
HOWEVER.

01:30:53.882 --> 01:30:58.153 region:rollup2
WE NOTE THAT DCA DOES PROVIDE

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:59.087 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY AND MEETS WITH ALL

01:30:58.153 --> 01:31:01.089 region:rollup2
OF THE BOARDS BUREAUS ON AN

01:30:59.087 --> 01:31:02.824 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BASIS TALKS ABOUT THOSE

01:31:01.089 --> 01:31:05.627 region:rollup2
PRO RATA CHARGES AND WHAT THOSE

01:31:02.824 --> 01:31:06.428 region:rollup2
SERVICES WILL INCLUDE I'M ON A

01:31:05.627 --> 01:31:08.697 region:rollup2
YEAR TO YEAR BASIS.

01:31:06.428 --> 01:31:10.432 region:rollup2
ALSO A JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS

01:31:08.697 --> 01:31:10.999 region:rollup2
AND CONCERNS THAT DEPARTMENT

01:31:10.432 --> 01:31:13.635 region:rollup2
FINANCE HIGHS ABOUT TRACKING

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:15.770 region:rollup2
THE.

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:17.906 region:rollup2
USAGE IS.

01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:19.774 region:rollup2
BUDGET PLANNING WOULD BE REALLY

01:31:17.906 --> 01:31:22.177 region:rollup2
UNPREDICTABLE IF WE MOVED TO

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:22.711 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM OF ALL BASED

01:31:22.177 --> 01:31:24.312 region:rollup2
ON.

01:31:22.711 --> 01:31:27.115 region:rollup2
TRACKING IN USAGE.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:29.517 region:rollup2
PRO RATA CHARGES COULD SPIKE IN

01:31:27.115 --> 01:31:31.519 region:rollup2
ANY GIVEN YEAR AND ON A AN

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:32.854 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL BASIS THAT PROVIDES

01:31:31.519 --> 01:31:34.456 region:rollup2
A LOT OF.

01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:36.458 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINTY FOR BOARDS AND

01:31:34.456 --> 01:31:38.460 region:rollup2
HEROES AND PRETTY CA I WAS.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:39.794 region:rollup2
ONE BUDGET COULD GO UP BECAUSE

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:40.862 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NEAT IN NEED OF MORE

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.330 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND.

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:44.199 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO

01:31:42.330 --> 01:31:44.999 region:rollup2
COVER THOSE SERVICES IN ANY

01:31:44.199 --> 01:31:47.802 region:rollup2
GIVEN YEAR.

01:31:44.999 --> 01:31:49.404 region:rollup2
I ALSO WANT TO NOTE DIET A DCA

01:31:47.802 --> 01:31:50.472 region:rollup2
DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A SYSTEM

01:31:49.404 --> 01:31:53.141 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT IT.

01:31:50.472 --> 01:31:55.276 region:rollup2
THE TRACKING OF THEIR WORKLOAD

01:31:53.141 --> 01:31:55.810 region:rollup2
AT THIS POINT TIME AND SO IT

01:31:55.276 --> 01:31:57.812 region:rollup2
WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.747 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:31:57.812 --> 01:32:01.149 region:rollup2
OF POSSIBLY.

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:03.551 region:rollup2
BESOS PROGRAM THAT WOULD ASSIST

01:32:01.149 --> 01:32:03.952 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND TRACKING THIS TYPE

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:06.354 region:rollup2
OF WORK.

01:32:03.952 --> 01:32:08.356 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY UNIQUE AND NOT IT'S

01:32:06.354 --> 01:32:10.625 region:rollup2
NOT JUST TRANSACTIONAL SERVICES

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:13.161 region:rollup2
THAT DC PROVIDES BUT ALSO POLICY

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:15.563 region:rollup2
SUPPORT SO SEPARATE FROM OTHER.

01:32:13.161 --> 01:32:17.298 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES THAT DO YOU HAVE

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:19.567 region:rollup2
A PRO RATA STRUCTURE.

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:21.035 region:rollup2
THERE YOU KNOW ANALYZING POLICY

01:32:19.567 --> 01:32:22.103 region:rollup2
ANALYZING BUDGET CHANGE

01:32:21.035 --> 01:32:23.838 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS AS OPPOSED TO JUST

01:32:22.103 --> 01:32:25.573 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONAL SUCH AS HUMAN

01:32:23.838 --> 01:32:27.042 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND BUDGETING

01:32:25.573 --> 01:32:29.043 region:rollup2
TRANSACTIONAL SERVICES.

01:32:27.042 --> 01:32:30.779 region:rollup2
THE LAST POINT THAT I WANT TO

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:32.514 region:rollup2
MAKE IS THAT TRACKING THE DATA

01:32:30.779 --> 01:32:34.783 region:rollup2
FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT IT MAY

01:32:32.514 --> 01:32:37.185 region:rollup2
POSSIBLY PRODUCE SKEWED DATA.

01:32:34.783 --> 01:32:39.187 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW POLICY CHANGES THAT

01:32:37.185 --> 01:32:41.990 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES CHANGE ON AN ANNUAL

01:32:39.187 --> 01:32:43.992 region:rollup2
BASIS AND SO WHERE THERE MAY BE.

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:45.727 region:rollup2
A LOT OF POLICY EMPHASIS IN ONE

01:32:43.992 --> 01:32:47.729 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC BORDER BUREAU IN ONE

01:32:45.727 --> 01:32:49.464 region:rollup2
YEAR IT MIGHT IT MAY BE QUIET

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:51.332 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOWING YEAR AND SO IT

01:32:49.464 --> 01:32:53.068 region:rollup2
WOULD BE REALLY DIFFICULT TO.

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:54.536 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATE THIS DATA AND

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:56.271 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SOMETHING THAT'S VIABLE

01:32:54.536 --> 01:32:57.072 region:rollup2
FOR US TO EVALUATE TO PRODUCE

01:32:56.271 --> 01:32:58.807 region:rollup2
THE.

01:32:57.072 --> 01:33:00.008 region:rollup2
THE ANSWERS THAT.

01:32:58.807 --> 01:33:02.944 region:rollup2
THE LA EL AND AND.

01:33:00.008 --> 01:33:05.880 region:rollup2
WOULD BE LOOKING FOR THE GOING

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:06.548 region:rollup2
BACK TO STATEMENT YOU THINK IT'S

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:06.714 region:rollup2
A HORRIBLE RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT

01:33:06.548 --> 01:33:07.348 region:rollup2
IS.

01:33:06.714 --> 01:33:08.817 region:rollup2
WE DO THINK THAT THE CURRENT

01:33:07.348 --> 01:33:10.685 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE IS EQUITABLE AND

01:33:08.817 --> 01:33:12.687 region:rollup2
PROVIDES A GUARANTEE OF THE

01:33:10.685 --> 01:33:13.888 region:rollup2
SERVICE IS BEING DISTRIBUTED

01:33:12.687 --> 01:33:15.223 region:rollup2
RIGHT WING REPORTED IT DOESN'T

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:16.691 region:rollup2
SEEM LIKE THAT HORRIBLE AND.

01:33:15.223 --> 01:33:18.827 region:rollup2
PESSIMISM MEASURE YET THINGS

01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT

01:33:18.827 --> 01:33:19.761 region:rollup2
SOME METHODOLOGY TO MEASURE

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:22.030 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:33:19.761 --> 01:33:24.032 region:rollup2
SOME IS BEING CHARGED.

01:33:22.030 --> 01:33:25.233 region:rollup2
AND IN THE BEST ZIP LIKE GIVE A

01:33:24.032 --> 01:33:26.434 region:rollup2
REFER SOME WERE YOU KNOW THE

01:33:25.233 --> 01:33:27.769 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

01:33:26.434 --> 01:33:29.104 region:rollup2
S. CHARGING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.438 region:rollup2
DOLLARS TO BUILD A POLICE CAR.

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.072 region:rollup2
AND YET SOMEONE ELSE COULD

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.173 region:rollup2
DELIVER TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:33.775 region:rollup2
SO IT'S JUST.

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:35.777 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:37.111 region:rollup2
FAIR SHARE AS THEY GO BUT. NOT

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:38.713 region:rollup2
BE OVER CHARGED ON THAT'S I MEAN

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:39.380 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS AND

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:40.715 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE A BETTER MECHANISM

01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:42.984 region:rollup2
TO TRACK.

01:33:40.715 --> 01:33:44.185 region:rollup2
THESE COST AND WE DO UNDERSTAND.

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.787 region:rollup2
THAT CONCERN TOTALLY.

01:33:44.185 --> 01:33:48.456 region:rollup2
.

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:50.992 region:rollup2
WE YOU KNOW HOW I NOTED THAT.

01:33:48.456 --> 01:33:52.861 region:rollup2
THE MOST OF THOSE SERVICES ARE

01:33:50.992 --> 01:33:54.329 region:rollup2
TRAPPED BY USAGE BUT THE

01:33:52.861 --> 01:33:56.598 region:rollup2
REMAINING THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO

01:33:54.329 --> 01:33:58.466 region:rollup2
DO SUCH I'M TRACKING.

01:33:56.598 --> 01:34:01.136 region:rollup2
ARE DONE WITH THE BEST

01:33:58.466 --> 01:34:03.805 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY THAT WE FEEL IS

01:34:01.136 --> 01:34:05.006 region:rollup2
APPLICABLE TO ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:06.341 region:rollup2
WHOSE INTEGRAL STATE OBVIOUSLY

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:08.209 region:rollup2
GOT MOVED FOR A REASON AND IT

01:34:06.341 --> 01:34:08.743 region:rollup2
REALLY STANDS OUT.

01:34:08.209 --> 01:34:11.412 region:rollup2
SO.

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:12.013 region:rollup2
WHO A GOOD QUESTION ONCE

01:34:11.412 --> 01:34:13.014 region:rollup2
APPEARED THE NEW DEPARTMENT OF

01:34:12.013 --> 01:34:13.815 region:rollup2
REAL ESTATE?

01:34:13.014 --> 01:34:15.683 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:17.151 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES.

01:34:15.683 --> 01:34:18.620 region:rollup2
FOR SELF AT A LOWER PRICE THAN

01:34:17.151 --> 01:34:21.956 region:rollup2
THE CA TO PROVIDE SIMILAR

01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:23.958 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:34:21.956 --> 01:34:25.827 region:rollup2
I A PROVIDED A HANDOUT THAT.

01:34:23.958 --> 01:34:27.695 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED OUT JUST A FEW

01:34:25.827 --> 01:34:30.899 region:rollup2
MOMENTS AGO THAT WALKS THROUGH

01:34:27.695 --> 01:34:32.367 region:rollup2
THE BREAKOUT OF. THE ESTIMATED

01:34:30.899 --> 01:34:33.968 region:rollup2
FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:35.970 region:rollup2
OF WHAT BREED WOULD BE PAYING

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:37.305 region:rollup2
FOR THEIR PRO RATA NEXT YEAR

01:34:35.970 --> 01:34:40.375 region:rollup2
SHOULD THEY HAVE STAINED.

01:34:37.305 --> 01:34:42.377 region:rollup2
AND I CAN WALK THROUGH EACH OF

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:43.845 region:rollup2
THOSE ROSE IF YOU LIKE BUT. I

01:34:42.377 --> 01:34:45.713 region:rollup2
THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS.

01:34:43.845 --> 01:34:47.982 region:rollup2
AND WHAT MAKES IT'S DIFFICULT

01:34:45.713 --> 01:34:49.851 region:rollup2
IS THAT PRES CURRENT REQUEST FOR

01:34:47.982 --> 01:34:51.052 region:rollup2
ON GOING STAFFING DOESN'T

01:34:49.851 --> 01:34:52.921 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE CA

01:34:51.052 --> 01:34:54.255 region:rollup2
SERVICES ON A ONE TO ONE BASIS

01:34:52.921 --> 01:34:55.723 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A LOT OF SERVICES ARE

01:34:54.255 --> 01:34:56.925 region:rollup2
STAND ALONE SERVICES THAT

01:34:55.723 --> 01:34:58.393 region:rollup2
REQUIRE.

01:34:56.925 --> 01:34:59.994 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT WHETHER

01:34:58.393 --> 01:35:00.929 region:rollup2
OR NOT THERE ARE THIRTY EIGHT

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:02.664 region:rollup2
THIRTY NINE OR FORTY FOUR TWO

01:35:02.664 --> 01:35:06.267 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY THEORY HAS SOME

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:07.869 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF THAT ARE

01:35:06.267 --> 01:35:10.004 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN HOUSE.

01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:12.273 region:rollup2
BEFORE JOINING THE CA PRE

01:35:10.004 --> 01:35:13.875 region:rollup2
CONTRACTED FOR SOME SERVICES

01:35:12.273 --> 01:35:16.544 region:rollup2
THAT THEY PRESUMABLY WILL

01:35:13.875 --> 01:35:17.212 region:rollup2
CONTRACT FOR AGAIN ONCE THE EXIT

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.279 region:rollup2
AND THOSE HAVEN'T BEEN ACCOUNTED

01:35:17.212 --> 01:35:19.881 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:35:18.279 --> 01:35:22.150 region:rollup2
ALSO.

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:23.885 region:rollup2
TO SAYS WITH ANY DEPARTMENT THAT

01:35:22.150 --> 01:35:25.353 region:rollup2
STARTING OUT OR AT ANY POINT

01:35:23.885 --> 01:35:26.821 region:rollup2
DURING THE BUDGET YEAR IF

01:35:25.353 --> 01:35:28.556 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED.

01:35:26.821 --> 01:35:30.425 region:rollup2
PRE HAS THE ABILITY TO ASK FOR

01:35:28.556 --> 01:35:32.293 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE

BCP PROCESS.

01:35:32.293 --> 01:35:34.829 region:rollup2
SO.

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:35.897 region:rollup2
THEY MAY FIND THAT AS THEY GO

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:37.098 region:rollup2
ALONG THEY ARE NOT CORRECTLY

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:39.100 region:rollup2
RESOURCE.

01:35:37.098 --> 01:35:41.235 region:rollup2
.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:43.238 region:rollup2
REMAINING DCA STAFF WILL BE

01:35:41.235 --> 01:35:45.640 region:rollup2
REDIRECTED TO ASSIST OTHER PORTS

01:35:43.238 --> 01:35:47.108 region:rollup2
AND BUREAUS AND THERE ARE A LOT

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.309 region:rollup2
OF NON JURISDICTIONAL WORKLOAD

01:35:47.108 --> 01:35:49.644 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS LIKE WHAT I WAS

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:51.779 region:rollup2
ALLUDING TO A MOMENT AGO THAT

01:35:49.644 --> 01:35:53.248 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE. SERVICED AND PAID

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:55.116 region:rollup2
FOR AT DCA.

01:35:53.248 --> 01:35:57.652 region:rollup2
AN EXAMPLE WOULD BE OUR PHONE

01:52:22.769 --> 01:52:26.640 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:52:25.038 --> 01:52:29.176 region:rollup2
ON I HIGH RAISES I'M NOT REALLY

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:30.911 region:rollup2
SURE I JUST KEEP I KEEP RAISING

01:52:29.176 --> 01:52:32.779 region:rollup2
THIS I'M NOT. YOU KNOW AT SOME

01:52:30.911 --> 01:52:33.447 region:rollup2
POINT MAYBE I GET TIRED OF IT

01:52:32.779 --> 01:52:35.182 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO

01:52:33.447 --> 01:52:37.317 region:rollup2
OUR COLLEAGUES AT. THE SIR THESE

01:52:35.182 --> 01:52:39.853 region:rollup2
ARE BUDGET EXPENDITURES THAT.

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:41.188 region:rollup2
IF WE KNEW IN TWO THOUSAND NINE

01:52:39.853 --> 01:52:42.389 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THOSE

01:52:41.188 --> 01:52:43.457 region:rollup2
DECISIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE

01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:44.925 region:rollup2
AND AND FRANKLY FROM MY

01:52:43.457 --> 01:52:47.194 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE SITTING HERE IN TWO

01:52:44.925 --> 01:52:48.395 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. I'M WONDERING

01:52:47.194 --> 01:52:49.730 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE WANT TO COMMIT TO

01:52:48.395 --> 01:52:52.666 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF DOLLARS THROUGH

01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:52.933 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ONE A NUMBER

01:52:52.666 --> 01:52:54.267 region:rollup2
OF US.

01:52:52.933 --> 01:52:55.469 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:52:54.267 --> 01:52:57.204 region:rollup2
WILL BE OUR TENTH OR TWELFTH

01:52:55.469 --> 01:52:58.005 region:rollup2
YEAR. ARM I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:52:57.204 --> 01:52:59.606 region:rollup2
ANSWERS.

01:52:58.005 --> 01:53:01.341 region:rollup2
ONE QUESTION ONE THING I WOULD

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:02.809 region:rollup2
LIKE TO REQUEST OF STAFF IF

01:53:01.341 --> 01:53:04.544 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE IN THE BACKGROUND.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:05.879 region:rollup2
FUTURE.

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:07.481 region:rollup2
IF IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO PUT JUST

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:08.949 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT

01:53:07.481 --> 01:53:10.550 region:rollup2
FOR THESE PROJECTS BECAUSE I

01:53:08.949 --> 01:53:12.419 region:rollup2
THINK THE SUMMARY THAT WE HAVE.

01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:14.154 region:rollup2
GIVES A A SNAPSHOT OF EXACTLY

01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:15.622 region:rollup2
WHERE WE ARE TODAY BUT DOESN'T

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:17.491 region:rollup2
TELL US WHAT THE LONGEVITY IS.

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:19.226 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:53:17.491 --> 01:53:20.961 region:rollup2
CLEARLY FROM ONE PERSPECTIVE

01:53:19.226 --> 01:53:21.895 region:rollup2
SIDE.

01:53:20.961 --> 01:53:24.164 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DOING SOMETHING RIGHT

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:25.632 region:rollup2
AND I I'M I'M NOT SURE WE DO

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:27.234 region:rollup2
NEXT BUT I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE

01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:29.503 region:rollup2
TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT.

01:53:27.234 --> 01:53:31.505 region:rollup2
WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE

01:53:29.503 --> 01:53:34.307 region:rollup2
THESE LARGE IT PROJECTS YOU HAVE

01:53:31.505 --> 01:53:35.242 region:rollup2
HURT ME. A TALK ABOUT THIS EVERY

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:36.710 region:rollup2
TWO WEEKS WITH ANOTHER

01:53:35.242 --> 01:53:37.377 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WITH ANOTHER LARGE IT

01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:39.246 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:53:37.377 --> 01:53:40.847 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION.

01:53:39.246 --> 01:53:42.716 region:rollup2
THE ELF ALSO MY COLLEAGUES

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:44.584 region:rollup2
COMMENTS I DON'T HAVE MUCH STATE

01:53:42.716 --> 01:53:46.186 region:rollup2
IN MUCH FAITH IN THE STATE I

01:53:44.584 --> 01:53:47.788 region:rollup2
TEAM. BECAUSE WE COME.

01:53:46.186 --> 01:53:49.523 region:rollup2
PROJECT AFTER PROJECT THAT'S

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:50.057 region:rollup2
OVER COST OVERRUN IN THIS

01:53:49.523 --> 01:53:51.525 region:rollup2
DOESN'T REALLY GIVE CHIU

01:53:50.057 --> 01:53:53.260 region:rollup2
SNAPSHOT. WAS OVER A HUNDRED

01:53:51.525 --> 01:53:54.594 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS WHEN I FIRST

01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:55.796 region:rollup2
STARTED IN IN WE TURN OUT IN

01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:57.130 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR.

01:53:55.796 --> 01:53:58.598 region:rollup2
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE THIRD OF OUR

01:53:57.130 --> 01:54:00.067 region:rollup2
WAY THROUGH THIS STILL WILL NOT

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.734 region:rollup2
BE DONE.

01:54:00.067 --> 01:54:01.935 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:54:00.734 --> 01:54:03.003 region:rollup2
SUBSTITUTING IT IT'S A IT'S A

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:03.937 region:rollup2
WASTE OF MONEY IT'S YOU KNOW IF

01:54:03.003 --> 01:54:05.272 region:rollup2
THIS WAS.

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:07.007 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE BUSINESS.

01:54:05.272 --> 01:54:09.276 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I JUST.

01:54:07.007 --> 01:54:10.343 region:rollup2
WE WE CAN FUNCTION.

01:54:09.276 --> 01:54:12.212 region:rollup2
AND IT'S JUST IT'S AS IF IT BEST

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:15.682 region:rollup2
IS DYSFUNCTIONAL.

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:17.284 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SO I I.

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:18.618 region:rollup2
I'M FRUSTRATED WHEN WE'RE ALL

01:54:17.284 --> 01:54:19.219 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED APPEARED I AGREED

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:20.087 region:rollup2
LIKELY WE SHOULDN'T BOTH THESE

01:54:19.219 --> 01:54:21.822 region:rollup2
PROJECTS.

01:54:20.087 --> 01:54:22.889 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT AND WE'RE GONNA BE

01:54:21.822 --> 01:54:24.224 region:rollup2
HERE FOR A WHILE STILL SO. WE

01:54:22.889 --> 01:54:27.160 region:rollup2
STOPPED RUNNING IT.

01:54:24.224 --> 01:54:28.895 region:rollup2
MR SHAPIRO.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:30.097 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY I'M NOT PROBABLY BRINGS

01:54:28.895 --> 01:54:31.832 region:rollup2
IT BUT A GOOD SUBJECT FOR A

01:54:30.097 --> 01:54:32.365 region:rollup2
HEARING IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR

01:54:31.832 --> 01:54:33.700 region:rollup2
US TO HAVE.

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:35.702 region:rollup2
THAT THE.

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.903 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY DEPARTMENT COME AND

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:38.238 region:rollup2
TALK TO US ABOUT HOW THEY'VE

01:54:36.903 --> 01:54:40.240 region:rollup2
CHANGED THE PROCUREMENT METHOD.

01:54:38.238 --> 01:54:41.575 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS PROCUREMENT METHOD

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:44.778 region:rollup2
WAS THE OLD METHOD.

01:54:41.575 --> 01:54:45.312 region:rollup2
THAT WAS UTILIZED WHICH IS YOU

01:54:44.778 --> 01:54:47.848 region:rollup2
OUGHT YOU FIGURED OUT.

01:54:45.312 --> 01:54:49.716 region:rollup2
.

01:54:47.848 --> 01:54:51.718 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A METHOD

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:54.254 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU USE YOU SAY HERE'S

01:54:51.718 --> 01:54:56.123 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW. SO WE'RE GONNA BY

01:54:54.254 --> 01:54:57.991 region:rollup2
WHAT WE KNOW. AND THEN YOU GET

01:54:56.123 --> 01:54:59.993 region:rollup2
BIDS FOR THAT. AND THEN.

01:54:57.991 --> 01:55:02.129 region:rollup2
.

01:54:59.993 --> 01:55:03.597 region:rollup2
IT TAKES IT'S IT IT'S AT LEAST A

01:55:02.129 --> 01:55:04.931 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR PROCESS TO PUT THEM

01:55:03.597 --> 01:55:06.533 region:rollup2
TO BED THAT ARE OF PIECE

01:55:04.931 --> 01:55:08.268 region:rollup2
TOGETHER TO GO OUT TO GET THE

01:55:06.533 --> 01:55:10.003 region:rollup2
BIDS IN AND RUN IT THROUGH. THE

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:11.204 region:rollup2
WAY THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:55:10.003 --> 01:55:12.139 region:rollup2
DEALS WITH THAT SO THAT WEEK

01:55:11.204 --> 01:55:14.408 region:rollup2
THAT LEGISLATURE GETS

01:55:12.139 --> 01:55:15.876 region:rollup2
INFORMATION. AND SO BY THE TIME

01:55:14.408 --> 01:55:17.611 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE'S IS PUTTING THE

01:55:15.876 --> 01:55:20.147 region:rollup2
STAMP OF APPROVAL THE PROJECT

01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:21.481 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN. IN OPERATION FOR LIKE

01:55:20.147 --> 01:55:23.216 region:rollup2
FOUR YEARS SOME BUT SOMETHING

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:24.418 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT AND THEN THEY START

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:25.218 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT.

01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:28.021 region:rollup2
AND.

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:29.356 region:rollup2
AND THE CHALLENGE IS IT THAT IT

01:55:28.021 --> 01:55:31.091 region:rollup2
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS ALREADY OLD

01:55:29.356 --> 01:55:32.559 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE. IT'S UNKNOWN

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.961 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS AVAILABLE

01:55:32.559 --> 01:55:36.563 region:rollup2
FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND SO TO THE

01:55:34.961 --> 01:55:40.834 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY HAS CHANGED.

01:55:36.563 --> 01:55:42.436 region:rollup2
AND SO ON AND. AND FRANKLY.

01:55:40.834 --> 01:55:43.770 region:rollup2
IN THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT A BIG

01:55:42.436 --> 01:55:45.372 region:rollup2
PART OF THE PROBLEM WAS THAT

01:55:43.770 --> 01:55:47.240 region:rollup2
EACH BOARD.

01:55:45.372 --> 01:55:48.441 region:rollup2
HAD TO DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:50.310 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD MAKE IN THEIR PROCESS

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:52.179 region:rollup2
SEIZE IN ORDER FOR THE FOR THEM

01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:54.981 region:rollup2
TO THEN GIVE ADVICE.

01:55:52.179 --> 01:55:56.983 region:rollup2
TO THE DEVELOPERS OF THE OF THE

01:55:54.981 --> 01:55:59.386 region:rollup2
PLATFORM FOR THEIR BOARD. AND

01:55:56.983 --> 01:56:01.254 region:rollup2
THEY IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THEM

01:55:59.386 --> 01:56:02.456 region:rollup2
TO KNOW WHAT PROCESS SEES IT

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:04.591 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE SKILL SETS

01:56:02.456 --> 01:56:05.926 region:rollup2
TO TO KNOW AND SO WE WERE WEIRD

01:56:04.591 --> 01:56:08.462 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE WE'RE DEALING WITH.

01:56:05.926 --> 01:56:09.796 region:rollup2
WITH FORTY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS

01:56:08.462 --> 01:56:11.398 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIS SO.

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:13.133 region:rollup2
THE PROCESSES CHANGED I KNOW

01:56:11.398 --> 01:56:15.268 region:rollup2
IT'S CHANGED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT

01:56:13.133 --> 01:56:17.003 region:rollup2
TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S TECHNOLOGY

01:56:15.268 --> 01:56:18.605 region:rollup2
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WILL BE

01:56:17.003 --> 01:56:20.207 region:rollup2
BUYING UNDER THAT SYSTEM ANY

01:56:18.605 --> 01:56:21.541 region:rollup2
LONGER AND SO WOULD BE GOOD FOR

01:56:20.207 --> 01:56:23.410 region:rollup2
US TO HAVE.

01:56:21.541 --> 01:56:25.145 region:rollup2
I PRESENTATION SO WE CAN SEE

01:56:23.410 --> 01:56:27.948 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS THAT THAT THE NEW

01:56:25.145 --> 01:56:29.416 region:rollup2
SYSTEM ENTAILS BECAUSE I AGREE

01:56:27.948 --> 01:56:31.017 region:rollup2
WITH YOU IT IS FRUSTRATING YOU

01:56:29.416 --> 01:56:32.219 region:rollup2
LOOK AT IT IT IT DIDN'T. OUT

01:56:31.017 --> 01:56:33.553 region:rollup2
WORK WELL FOR MANY OF THE OF THE

01:56:32.219 --> 01:56:35.021 region:rollup2
BOARDS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T DO

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:35.956 region:rollup2
THE ADVANCE PLANNING AND THEY

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.557 region:rollup2
JUST BASICALLY SAID HERE'S OUR

01:56:35.956 --> 01:56:39.025 region:rollup2
PROCESSES.

01:56:37.557 --> 01:56:40.760 region:rollup2
THERE TWENTY FIVE STEPS TO GET

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:42.095 region:rollup2
LICENSING AND SO WE'RE JUST

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:43.830 region:rollup2
CREATE THOSE TWENTY FIVE STEPS

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:45.165 region:rollup2
ON THE COULD HAVE REDONE THEIR.

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:46.366 region:rollup2
THEIR PROCESS AND HAVE HAD SOME

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:47.567 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCY NOT AGREEING GOING

01:56:46.366 --> 01:56:49.035 region:rollup2
FOR LEASE IT PROJECTS WE SHOULD

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:50.237 region:rollup2
HAVE A.

01:56:49.035 --> 01:56:51.705 region:rollup2
A BETTER SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S

01:56:50.237 --> 01:56:52.906 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS

01:56:51.705 --> 01:56:55.575 region:rollup2
FROM DAY ONE THROUGH EMAIL

01:56:52.906 --> 01:56:56.776 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WISE WE.

01:56:55.575 --> 01:56:58.512 region:rollup2
THE US WERE ASKING WHERE A

01:56:56.776 --> 01:57:00.380 region:rollup2
SINGLES OLD BCP'S.

01:56:58.512 --> 01:57:02.382 region:rollup2
THAT'S OVER A MILLION NOW SO

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.717 region:rollup2
LESSEN MY AGATHA BB REQUEST THE

01:57:02.382 --> 01:57:05.051 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE FOR FUTURE.

01:57:03.717 --> 01:57:06.786 region:rollup2
I TO PROJECTS TO KNOW HOW MUCH

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:08.521 region:rollup2
WE'RE INTO IT. AND AND I JUST

01:57:06.786 --> 01:57:10.524 region:rollup2
THINK THAT IT'S IT'S BETTER IF

01:57:08.521 --> 01:57:13.727 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT.

01:57:10.524 --> 01:57:15.061 region:rollup2
THAT THE PROCUREMENT THE RFP.

01:57:13.727 --> 01:57:17.197 region:rollup2
THE REASON THAT WE DO IT THAT

01:57:15.061 --> 01:57:18.131 region:rollup2
WAY OR DID IT THAT WAY IT IT

01:57:17.197 --> 01:57:19.332 region:rollup2
WORKS REALLY GOOD FOR

01:57:18.131 --> 01:57:21.067 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT BUT DOESN'T

01:57:19.332 --> 01:57:22.669 region:rollup2
WORK REAL GOOD FOR AN IT PROJECT

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:24.137 region:rollup2
AND. THE CHALLENGES THAT THE

01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:26.273 region:rollup2
REASON THAT WE DO IT THAT WAY SO

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:28.141 region:rollup2
THAT EVERYBODY GETS TO SEE WHAT

01:57:26.273 --> 01:57:29.609 region:rollup2
THAT HIGH BID IS OR THE LOW BID

01:57:28.141 --> 01:57:30.543 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY. AND YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:57:29.609 --> 01:57:32.679 region:rollup2
APPLES TO

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:34.014 region:rollup2
APPLES TO ORANGES AND.

01:57:32.679 --> 01:57:35.882 region:rollup2
TO DO I KEY PROJECTS THAT WE DID

01:57:34.014 --> 01:57:37.484 region:rollup2
THAT MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME SURE.

01:57:35.882 --> 01:57:38.818 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S NO COMMENTS WERE

01:57:37.484 --> 01:57:44.157 region:rollup2
HOLES ITEM OPEN.

01:57:38.818 --> 01:57:45.759 region:rollup2
DOCTOR CHOI.

01:57:44.157 --> 01:57:48.161 region:rollup2
THERE REALLY ARE FRUSTRATING TO
