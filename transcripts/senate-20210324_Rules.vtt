00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:20.846
MAYBE NOTHING THAT RISES

00:21:20.912 --> 00:21:22.381
MISCONDUCT BUT OTHER ISSUES

00:21:22.447 --> 00:21:24.182
THAT MAY ARISE IN THE PRISON

00:21:24.249 --> 00:21:29.488
SETTING AND SO WE PUT ALL. THAT

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:30.088
TOGETHER AND I THINK I SHARED

00:21:30.155 --> 00:21:30.856
WITH. BOTH OF THE CENTER THAT I

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:33.158
PREMIUM WITH. I FIND THE IN

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:37.429
PERSON HEARINGS PERSONALLY-

00:21:37.496 --> 00:21:39.765
GIVE ME JUST A SLIGHT MORE EDGE

00:21:39.831 --> 00:21:42.567
ON JUDGING SOMEONE'S RESPONSES

00:21:42.634 --> 00:21:44.569
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE FULL.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.104
ABILITY TO OBSERVETHEIR

00:21:46.171 --> 00:21:47.739
MANNERISMS AND THEIR BODY

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.409
LANGUAGE X. CETERA HOWEVER I AM

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:51.877
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED THAT NOW

00:21:51.943 --> 00:21:52.577

00:21:52.644 --> 00:21:54.846
VIRTUALLY. WE DON'T LOSE THAT

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:56.715
MUCH OF THAT- PROBABLY LESS

00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.617
THAN I THOUGHT WE MIGHT AND SO

00:21:58.684 --> 00:21:59.951
I THINK WE'RE STILL ABLE TO

00:22:00.018 --> 00:22:01.887
APPLY OUR JUDGMENT BASED UPON

00:22:01.953 --> 00:22:03.822
THEIR ANSWERS AND OF COURSE

00:22:03.889 --> 00:22:05.724
WERE GIVEN. TRAINING ON A

00:22:05.791 --> 00:22:09.494
CONSTANT BASIS AS FAR AS ON HOW

00:22:09.561 --> 00:22:11.063
TO WAIT VARIOUS MATTERS WE HAVE

00:22:11.129 --> 00:22:13.065

TOOL THAT WE USE TO HELP

00:28:50.762 --> 00:28:52.397
WOULD JUST DO ONE QUICK FOR A

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:54.466
FOLLOW UP FOR MISTER BARTON.

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:57.469
BECAUSE OF ONE OF THE THINGS WE

00:28:57.535 --> 00:28:57.936
TALKED ABOUT THAT WAS

00:28:58.002 --> 00:29:00.205
INTERESTING TO ME. ISTHAT

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.474
THERE ARE OCCASIONALLY ON BOND

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:06.044
HEARINGS TO RE LOOK AT THE

00:29:06.111 --> 00:29:07.779
OUTCOME OF SOME OF THE HEARINGS

00:29:07.846 --> 00:29:09.581
THAT SOME OF YOU MIGHT. HAVE

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.950
DONE INDIVIDUALLY AND YOU SAID

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:14.119
THAT EVERYBODY GETS REVERSED

00:29:14.185 --> 00:29:16.154
OCCASIONALLY. ARE COULD YOU

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.889
TALK ABOUT THAT PROCESS AND

00:29:17.956 --> 00:29:19.157
COULD YOU TALK SHORT WHAT YOU

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.827
LEARN FROM IT WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

00:29:22.894 --> 00:29:25.029
SURE I WILL SAY WHEN I STARTED-

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.865
HAVING BEEN THE HEAD OF AN

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.467
AGENCY IS- OTHER THAN WHEN I

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:30.969
MET WITH MEMBERS OF THE

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:33.004
LEGISLATURE I WAS PRETTY MUCH

00:29:33.071 --> 00:29:34.806
RUNNING THINGS AND SO IT WAS A

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:36.241
LITTLE. WITH A LITTLE

00:29:36.307 --> 00:29:37.876
TREPIDATION I WANTED MY FIRST

00:29:37.942 --> 00:29:39.244
AND BOND HEARING WHEN I FIRST

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.446
HAD A CASE. THAT WAS SENT BACK

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.213
TO ALL THE COMMISSIONERS

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.082
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE SIXTEEN OR

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.983
FIFTEEN OR HOWEVER MANY OF YOUR

00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:46.518
COLLEAGUES READING YOUR

00:29:46.584 --> 00:29:48.319
TRANSCRIPT AND LITERALLY. YOU

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:51.356
KNOW SITTING. IN YOUR PLACE AND

00:29:51.422 --> 00:29:53.825
RETHINKING THAT DECISION AND SO

00:29:53.892 --> 00:29:56.961
WHAT I EXPLAINED CENTER IS THAT

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:58.796
NOBODY IN THIS JOB ALL OF OUR

00:29:58.863 --> 00:30:00.865
COLLEAGUES- TAKES IT PERSONALLY

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:02.767
WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT ON EVERY

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:04.068
ANY GIVEN DAY REASONABLE MINDS

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.236
MAY DIFFER AND WE ALL

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.638
UNDERSTAND THAT NONE OF US IS

00:30:06.704 --> 00:30:07.438
PERFECT WE MIGHT MISS

00:30:07.505 --> 00:30:09.007
SOMETHING. THAT OTHER PEOPLE

00:30:09.073 --> 00:30:11.209
SEE AND SOWE ALL TAKE THAT AS

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:12.544
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE I KNOW

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.113
FOR ME IT CERTAINLY WAS- HAVING

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:16.447
A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AND-

00:30:16.514 --> 00:30:18.583
THOSE CASES CAN COME BACK AND

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:22.554
BONTA IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT WAYS

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:23.021
ONE OF THEM. I THINK I

00:30:23.087 --> 00:30:23.555
MENTIONED. TO ONE OF THE

00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:25.123
SENATORS I MIGHT HAVE BEEN THIS

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:27.759
MORNING. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SELL

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:29.360
PREFER IF FOR SOME REASON YOU

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.396
MADE A DECISION AND YOU KNOW A

00:30:31.462 --> 00:30:32.931
DAY OR TWO LATER YOU'RE NOT

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.599
SURE ABOUT IT IT HAPPENED TO ME

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.335
ONCE AND I THINK- I THINK I'VE

00:30:37.402 --> 00:30:38.336
DONE ABOUT NINE HUNDRED

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:40.605
HEARINGS AND- WHERE ME AND

00:30:40.672 --> 00:30:41.773
WHILE THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.441
AND I TALKED ABOUT IT. IN THAT

00:30:43.508 --> 00:30:44.742
CASE WE ACTUALLY DENIED

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:46.010
SOMEBODY AND THE MORE WE

00:30:46.077 --> 00:30:47.045
THOUGHT ABOUT IT THE MORE WE

00:30:47.111 --> 00:30:47.946
THOUGHT YOU KNOW LET'S

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:49.614
EVERYBODY TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.649
SO WE CAN SELL FOR IT AND THEN

00:30:51.716 --> 00:30:53.084
IN THE NEXT EN BANC MEETING ALL

00:30:53.151 --> 00:30:54.252
THE COMMISSIONERS WILL LOOK AT

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.054
IT. AND REEVALUATE THAT

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:57.622
DECISION OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:59.290
CAN REMOVE CAN SEND CASES BACK

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:03.394
AND BONK- FOR ALL OF THE

00:31:03.461 --> 00:31:03.995
COMMISSIONERS TO LOOK AT. FOR

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:06.264
VARIOUS LEGAL REASONS- BUT

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:09.100
OFTEN TIMES IT'S TO SEE WHETHER

00:31:09.167 --> 00:31:10.735
OR NOT WE FOR. THE REST OF THE

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:11.603
COMMISSIONERS FELT THAT ONE

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:12.837
COMMISSIONERS GRANT WAS IN

00:31:12.904 --> 00:31:14.505
PROVIDENCE. AND THAT OUR LEGAL

00:31:14.572 --> 00:31:16.241
TEAM THAT REVIEWS ALL OF OUR

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:19.477
CASES. CAN ALSO BRING IT BACK.

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.579
TO THE REST OF THE- BOARD

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:24.115
EMBARK OFTENTIMES BECAUSE MAYBE

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:25.783
THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT WHETHER

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.118
THE RECORD WAS GOOD ENOUGH ONE

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.753
OF THE POINTS COMMISSIONER

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.154
CHAPELLE MADE AND I THINK

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:31.389
COMMISSIONER SOLOMON CHECK.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.057
SECOND IT IS AT ALL OF OUR

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:34.125
DECISIONS ARE GOING TO GET

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:35.627
REVIEW WHETHER TO GRANT OR

00:31:35.693 --> 00:31:37.095
DENIAL GETS REVIEWED BY SOMEONE

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.863
OBVIOUSLY GRANTS AND OF IN THE

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.331
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THE NILES

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:42.200
COULD END UP IN SUPERIOR COURT

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.968
HELLO CORD FEDERAL COURT. BUT

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:45.236
THEY ALL GET REVIEWED BY OUR

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:46.704
OWN OFFICE SO THERE'S ALWAYS

00:31:46.771 --> 00:31:48.172
GOING TO BE A REVIEW PROCESS

00:31:48.239 --> 00:31:49.807
AND THAT'S WHY THIS JOB IT'S SO

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:52.110
IMPORTANT. TO MAKE A RECORD AND

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:54.012
BASE YOUR DECISIONS ON EVIDENCE

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:56.047
AS COMMISSIONER CHAPELLE SAID

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.949
THAT IS STATED IN THE RECORD

00:31:58.016 --> 00:31:59.183
AND SO THAT WAS ONE OF MY

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.519
BIGGEST- I THINK BENEFITS OF

00:32:01.586 --> 00:32:03.087
THAT PROCESS WAS LEARNING HOW

00:32:03.154 --> 00:32:05.056
IMPORTANT RECORD IS. BECAUSE

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:06.924
YOU MIGHT GO THROUGH HEARING.

00:32:06.991 --> 00:32:07.959
AND THINK THAT YOU'VE COVERED

00:32:08.026 --> 00:32:09.227
SOMETHING ADEQUATELY AND THEN

00:32:09.294 --> 00:32:13.131
YOU GO BACK AND READ. THE

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:13.731
TRANSCRIPT WHICH IS SOMETHING

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:14.365
THAT NONE OF US. SURE DOING IS

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.600
READING OUR INTO. I KNOW I

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:18.202
CERTAINLY DON'T. AND YET SEE

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:20.004
IT. AND REALIZE ALL HOW DID I

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:21.572
MISS THAT BUT IT'S A LEARNING

00:32:21.639 --> 00:32:22.840
EXPERIENCE FOR THE NEXT TIME

00:32:22.907 --> 00:32:25.476
SO. IT IS AN INVALUABLE

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:28.479
PROCESS- IT IS BOUND TO HAPPEN

00:32:28.546 --> 00:32:30.048
TO ALL OF US AT SOME POINT OR

00:32:30.114 --> 00:32:31.683
ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY. WE WOULD

00:32:31.749 --> 00:32:32.950
LIKE TO NOT HAVE IT HAPPEN

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:34.485
OFTEN AND HOPEFULLY THE MORE

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.621
WE- GO WITH MORE EXPERIENCE A

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:38.122
LESS OFTEN IT HAPPENS BUT

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:39.957
THAT'S A PROCESS. THANK YOU

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:33.097
VIDEO CONFERENCE HEARINGS-

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:35.233
FINANCIALLY- THEY WERE THEY

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:36.267
WERE THERE IS LITTLE

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:38.503
CHALLENGES- AND IF IT HAD TO DO

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:42.240
WITH TECHNICAL- CONNECTIVITY-

00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:43.774
BECAUSE IT WAS A NEW PROCESS TO

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:47.445
EVERYONE- IS FOREST HILL

00:35:47.512 --> 00:35:51.616
IMPACTING. MY HEARINGS- I THANK

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:54.452
I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT WASN'T A

00:35:54.519 --> 00:35:57.088
BIG IMPACT FROM I WAS STILL

00:35:57.154 --> 00:36:01.025
ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE OFFENDER I

00:36:01.092 --> 00:36:04.028
WAS STILL ABLE TO GO OVER ALL

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.830
OF THE FACTORS THAT ARE

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:11.836
INVOLVED. YEAH I DID SEE THAT

00:36:11.903 --> 00:36:13.804
WAS KIND OF CHALLENGING

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.439
ADDITIONALLY ARE FOR SOME OF

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:16.908
THE OFFENDERS BECAUSE SINCE

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:18.609
THIS WAS A NEW PROCESS THEY

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:20.077
WERE A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:22.947
ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT HAD-

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.616
HAD HEARINGS PRIOR TO THIS NEW

00:36:25.683 --> 00:36:27.285
PROCESS AND WE WERE SEEING THEM

00:36:27.351 --> 00:36:30.521
ON A SUBSEQUENT HEARING- SO

00:36:30.588 --> 00:36:34.659
WHAT IT DID IS IT. IT WE AS

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:36.227
COMMISSIONERS HAD TO TAKE THE

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:37.962
TIME TO REALLY EXPLAIN THE

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:42.033
PROCESS. REALLY MAKE SURE THAT

00:36:42.099 --> 00:36:44.001
AS BEST THEY COULD HOPE TO MAKE

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.136
THEM COMFORTABLE WITH THE

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:47.538
PROCESS BUT ONCE WE GOT GOING

00:36:47.605 --> 00:36:50.007
ON EVERYONE PRETTY MUCH KEEP

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:53.110
THE CAME ON BOARD SO. I THINK-

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:55.513
THIS PROCESS- IT WAS A GREAT

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.082
THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS- I

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.917
DON'T THINK OUR OUR WORKLOAD

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.485
WELL WE LOST ANYTHING WITH OUR

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:03.654
WORKLOAD AND THAT WAS A BIG

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:06.257
CONCERN- BECAUSE WE STILL

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:09.126
WANTED TO BE ABLE TO- BE ABLE

00:37:09.193 --> 00:37:12.897
TO SEE THE CD OFFENDERS IN THE

00:37:12.964 --> 00:37:15.766
HEARING PROCESS. WELL I WANT

00:37:15.833 --> 00:37:17.868
ANYONE OF THE REST OF YOU TO

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:18.769
ANSWER THE QUESTION I'M JUST

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.037
THINKING OUT BECAUSE IT MIGHT

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:22.073
HAVE BEEN EASIER. IF I IN TERMS

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:23.407
OF THE TIME THAT YOU SPENT

00:37:23.474 --> 00:37:25.142
TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE TIED

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:26.877
TO DO YOUR HEARINGS MAYBE IT.

00:37:26.944 --> 00:37:29.080
IF IT'S AS EFFICIENT AND

00:37:29.146 --> 00:37:32.717
PROVIDE YOU. THE OPPORTUNITY

00:37:32.783 --> 00:37:34.552
TO. SEEK ANSWERS BEYOND IT

00:37:34.619 --> 00:37:36.721
WOULD STARTED MAYBE JUST ON

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.990
THE- KIND OF WITHIN THE

00:37:39.056 --> 00:37:41.325
INDIVIDUAL CUTTING GET INTO

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:43.561
THEIR THEIR PSYCHE IN TERMS OF

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:44.061
WHETHER THEY'RE REALLY

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:46.263
COMMITTED TO RETURNING TO. TO

00:37:46.330 --> 00:37:48.132
SOCIETY AND DONE AS A

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:50.334
PRODUCTIVE MEMBER- IF THAT

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.168
DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH YOUR

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:54.472
ABILITY TO. REALLY FEEL ND

00:37:54.538 --> 00:37:56.073
KNOW THAT. THIS MIGHT BE

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:57.241
SOMETHING WE WANT TO TAKE A

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:58.376
LOOK AT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S

00:37:58.442 --> 00:37:59.810
PROVIDED PERHAPS MORE

00:37:59.877 --> 00:38:02.380
EFFICIENCY. AND CERTAINLY BEEN

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:05.182
POTENTIALLY- BETTER FOR YOU AND-

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.751
CERTAINLY THOSE WHO ARE

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:09.453
INCARCERATED WE'RE HOPING TO BE

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:11.288
PAROLED AND GET BACK. WITH

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.324
THEIR FAMILIES AND WITH LIFE SO

00:38:13.391 --> 00:38:14.992
WE PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT THAT

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:16.460
GOING FORWARD I HAVE JUST ONE

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:17.528
MORE QUESTION BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:19.130
VERY INTERESTED. IN THE

00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:20.665
REHABILITATION PROGRAMS I'M

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.401
VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. OF THE

00:38:23.467 --> 00:38:25.002
OF THE REFORMS THAT ARE LOOKING

00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:26.570
OUT TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE

00:38:26.637 --> 00:38:28.572
AN OPPORTUNITY GOT OFF ON THE

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.408
WRONG TRACK BUT TO GET BACK ON

00:38:30.474 --> 00:38:32.309
THE RIGHT TRACK. AND I WONDERED

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:34.812
IF THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU HAVE

00:38:34.879 --> 00:38:36.147
THAT ARE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.649
ARE. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:40.117
CONTINUED DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:38:40.184 --> 00:38:41.686
HAS THERE BEEN ANY INTERRUPTION

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:43.020
THAT YOU'VE NOTICED MADE A

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.622
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. OF

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.557
PEOPLE ACTUALLY ATTENDING ARE

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.626
BEING COMMITTED TO. THEIR

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:54.899
REHABILITATION PLAN. OF ANY

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:56.567
THOUGHT FOUND OUT. SIR IT'S

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:58.269
SLOW. THERE BUT ALL OF US LOOK

00:38:58.335 --> 00:39:00.237
FROM. PERIOD OF POSITIVELY AND

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:01.739
TATIAN LET ME ASK YOU TO STOP

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:02.740
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:04.709
TO TELL ME. THE TO THE

00:39:04.775 --> 00:39:07.111
STENOGRAPHER- I DIDN'T ANNOUNCE

00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.046
MYSELF. NO NO NO NO NO IT

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:10.815
DIDN'T IT DIDN'T SHOW THE FACE

00:39:10.881 --> 00:39:12.049
OF WHO WAS TALKING I DO YOU

00:39:12.116 --> 00:39:13.317
KNOW WHO WAS TALKING BUT NOW I

00:39:13.384 --> 00:39:14.518
KNOW IT'S MISTER BARTON I'M

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:17.154
REAL. OKAY I WILL PAY ATTENTION

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:18.389
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERSON

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:21.692
SPEAKING- AS WE START SO-

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:23.527
COMMISSIONER BARTON WILL YOU GO

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.295
AHEAD AND FORGIVE MY

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:27.631
INTERRUPTION- I APOLOGIZE I

00:39:27.698 --> 00:39:29.467
SHOULD ANNOUNCE MYSELF SO. I

00:39:29.533 --> 00:39:33.337
IN. THE CERTAINLY THE THERE IS-

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:34.772
MORE FLEXIBILITY I THINK NOW

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:37.208
BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE

00:39:37.274 --> 00:39:42.079
LOOKING. FOR AND IN TERMS OF-

00:39:42.146 --> 00:39:45.716
OVERALL. YOU KNOW IN THIS

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:47.718
PROCESS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW.

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.053
THAT WERE SEPARATED I THINK

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.155
THERE ARE CERTAIN SUBGROUPS

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:53.190
MAYBE WHERE COMMUNICATION IS A

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:56.093
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT- AND

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.328
MAYBE THIS IS MORE TO THE PRIOR

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.196
QUESTION DAN THEN THE QUESTION

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:02.066
THAT YOU JUST ASKED BUT I SEE

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:03.601
FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ALWAYS

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:05.136
GOING TO BE THAT SOME GROUP

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:07.571
THAT HAS OUT. COMMUNICATION

00:40:07.638 --> 00:40:09.840
DIFFICULTIES LET'S SAY SO

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:10.975
EITHER SIGN LANGUAGE OR

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.743
INTERPRETERS CASES LIKE THAT

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.078
WHERE I THINK IT WOULD STILL BE

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.412
ADVANTAGEOUS TO HAVE THOSE

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:17.214
HEARINGS IN PERSON SO THAT'S

00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:18.682
MORE TO THE PRIOR QUESTION AS

00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:20.417
FAR AS THE QUESTION ABOUT THEIR

00:40:20.484 --> 00:40:22.520
PROGRAMMING OBVIOUSLY WITH THE

00:40:22.586 --> 00:40:24.054
PANDEMIC THEY SHUT DOWN A LOT

00:40:24.121 --> 00:40:25.322
OF THE GROUP PROGRAMS BECAUSE

00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:27.024
THEY COULDN'T DO THAT. BUT WHEN

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:27.992
WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT LINK T

00:40:28.058 --> 00:40:29.927
CARRY A POSITIVE REHABILITATION

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:31.228
IT'S ALMOST NEVER JUST WHAT

00:40:31.295 --> 00:40:32.897
THEY'VE DONE THE LAST YEAR

00:40:32.963 --> 00:40:34.732
WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW OUR

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.600
TRANSFORMATION PROCESS AND

00:40:36.667 --> 00:40:38.435
HOPEFULLY HAPPENED YEARS AGO

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.471
MAYBE FIVE TEN YEARS AGO WE'RE

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:41.639
LOOKING FOR ABSENCE OF

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.674
MISCONDUCT AND THEN IF THEY

00:40:43.741 --> 00:40:45.342
HAVE JUST STARTED PROGRAMS IN

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:46.510
THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD BEEN

00:40:46.577 --> 00:40:48.245
DURING THE PANDEMIC. IT'S

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:49.980
HIGHLY LIKELY THAT IF THEY

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:51.348
WAITED THAT LONG BECAUSE MOST

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.684
THESE GUYS HAVE BEEN OR WOMEN

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:57.288
ARE HAVE BEEN. IN PRISON FOR

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:58.455
OVER TWENTY YEARS. THAT DOESN'T

00:40:58.522 --> 00:41:02.893
REALLY SHOW A VERY SINCERE OR-

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.496
COMMITTED WHEN FOR PROCESS

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:07.731
TOWARDS A REHABILITATION SO THE

00:41:07.798 --> 00:41:08.632
FACT THAT THEY HAVEN'T DONE IT

00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:10.267
IN A PANDEMIC ISN'T REALLY

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.302
GOING TO WORK AGAINST THEM IF

00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:12.636
WE SEE THAT THEY MADE GENUINE

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:14.905
EFFORTS BEFORE THAT AND THEN

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:15.806
I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.107
TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE'VE ALL

00:41:17.174 --> 00:41:18.843
BEEN INSPIRED BY YOUR

00:41:18.909 --> 00:41:21.345
CREATIVITY IN FINDING WAYS TO

00:41:21.412 --> 00:41:23.414
PROGRAM WHILE BEING BANNED. A

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.482
LOCKED DOWN IN THEIR UNITS AND

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:26.016
I'LL LET SOME OF THE OTHER

00:41:26.083 --> 00:41:28.185
SHARE SOME OF THOSE EXAMPLES

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:30.554
BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS WELL IT

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:34.091
CERTAINLY HAS- LIMITED THEIR

00:41:34.158 --> 00:41:35.192
ABILITY TO PROGRAM IN THE LAST

00:41:35.259 --> 00:41:38.128
YEAR WE LOOK MUCH FURTHER BACK

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:40.197
IN THEIR HISTORY AND HOW

00:41:40.264 --> 00:41:42.333
THEY'VE CONTINUED IT SO WE HAVE

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:47.271
A BIGGER PICTURE. IF YOU WILL

00:41:47.338 --> 00:41:47.838
THAN JUST THE TIME PERIOD OF

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.340
THE PANDEMIC. PHILIP JUST ASK

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:51.242
WHICH COMMISSIONER ROSY SHOW ME

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.943
YOUR HAND IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.713
TO THIS- COMMENT. I'LL GO FIRST

00:41:55.779 --> 00:41:57.681
WITH COMMISSIONER SOLOMON AND

00:41:57.748 --> 00:41:59.383
THEN TO COMMISSIONER DALE TORY.

THANK YOU YES JUST TO EXPAND

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:04.154
UPON WHAT MR- BARTON WAS

INDICATING IT'S THEY DO YOU

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:07.791
REALLY SEE THEM START TO TAKE

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.526
ADVANTAGE OF. A DIFFERENT TYPE

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:10.794
OF OPPORTUNITIES BRILLIANT

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.129
START MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO

00:42:12.196 --> 00:42:14.265
IMPEDIMENTS WHICH WHICH ARE

00:42:14.331 --> 00:42:14.932
GOING TO FACE WHEN THEY GOT TO

00:42:14.999 --> 00:42:17.601
THE COMMUNITY. SO YOU SEE THEM-

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:18.335
GOING SWITCHING TO

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:19.737
CORRESPONDENCE COURSES IN THE

00:42:19.803 --> 00:42:22.006
SAME SUBJECT AREAS- THAT THEY

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.574
WOULD HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING

00:42:23.641 --> 00:42:25.643
IN FACE TO FACE IT GIVES YOU IT

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.678
GIVES YOU SORT OF A GOOD

00:42:27.745 --> 00:42:29.179
FEELING ABOUT THEM AND THAT

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.114
THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.181
OWNERSHIP OF THEIR LIVES AND

00:42:31.248 --> 00:42:32.082
NOT LETTING SOMETHING STOP THEM

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:34.785
FROM. FROM ATTAINING THEIR GOAL

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:35.619
THEY'RE DOING THEIR READING

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.655
BOOKS- AGAIN THE CORRESPONDENCE

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:39.924

AT A GANG VIOLENCE DIRECTED AT-

00:42:43.027 --> 00:42:43.627

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.536
BY USING OLDER INMATES AS WELL

00:49:32.602 --> 00:49:35.639
AS- SOME OF THE OTHER-

00:49:35.706 --> 00:49:37.674
EDUCATIONAL PIECES TO TELL THEM

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:38.809
LOOK THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO

00:49:38.875 --> 00:49:40.344
YOUR TIME SO YOU CAN GET OUT

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:42.512
SOONER. I DON'T KNOW AND MAYBE

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:45.849
THE WARDENS DO ALTHOUGH I I'M

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.651
NOT SURE- IF WE DO THAT FOR ALL

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.319
OF OUR LIFE COMMITMENTS WHEN

00:49:49.386 --> 00:49:50.887
THEY FIRST COME TO PRISON. I

00:49:50.954 --> 00:49:52.122
KNOW THEY GO THROUGH RECEPTION

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:53.457
I KNOW THEY'RE GIVEN GENERAL

00:49:53.523 --> 00:49:55.726
INFORMATION ABOUT PROGRAMMING-

00:49:55.792 --> 00:49:58.095
BUT I'VE OFTEN WELL I CAN'T

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.196
COUNT THE NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.398
HAD GUYS SAY IF I'D- KNOWN.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.866
THEN WHEN I STARTED MY PRISON

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:04.568
TERM WHAT I KNOW NOW I WOULD

00:50:04.634 --> 00:50:06.370
HAVE DONE MY TIME DIFFERENTLY.

00:50:06.436 --> 00:50:08.372
AND SO I THINK. CREATING

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:12.008
SOMETHING AT INTAKE FOR LIFERS.

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:13.677
MAKE THEM AWARE OF THINGS SUCH

00:50:13.744 --> 00:50:15.712
AS ELDERLY PAROLE YOUTH

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:20.016
OFFENDER PAROLE- YOU KNOW HOW

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:21.785
YOU CAN. SHOW THAT YOU WERE

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:23.487
CHANGING IT CETERA AT AN

00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:26.390
EARLIER POINT IN TIME- WOULD BE

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.592
BENEFICIAL AND AGAIN I'VE NEVER

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:30.460
WORKED AT INTAKE STAGES AT A

00:50:30.527 --> 00:50:32.396
PRISON I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH.

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:34.097
WE TELL THOSE GUYS OR HOW MUCH

00:50:34.164 --> 00:50:36.266
WE PAY ATTENTION TO A SENTENCE

00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:38.668
IF IT'S FIFTEEN TO LIFE VERSUS

00:50:38.735 --> 00:50:42.672
A STRAIGHT. TWENTY YEARS- BUT

00:50:42.739 --> 00:50:43.306
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT I

00:50:43.373 --> 00:50:44.374
THINK. IF YOU GAIN THAT

00:50:44.441 --> 00:50:45.876
INFORMATION UP FRONT AND THEN

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:47.711

TO GET ACROSS TO THEM AS WELL

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.288
SO. MAYBE THAT'S THE PROCESS

00:50:58.355 --> 00:51:01.391
WHERE IT HAPPENS BUT I. JUST

00:51:01.458 --> 00:51:03.360
HEAR THAT FROM THE INMATES THAT

00:51:03.427 --> 00:51:06.096
IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD THEM THEY

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:06.563
WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.665
DIFFERENTLY. THANK YOU DID I

OF THE BEST THINGS THAT WE CAN

01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:40.216
TAKE THEM RIGHT OUT OF PRISON

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.450
PUT ON SOMEONE'S DOORSTEP WE

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:43.085
SEEN THAT THAT'S NOT. A

01:03:43.152 --> 01:03:44.854
SUCCESSFUL WAY TO PULL SOMEONE

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.755
SO MANY OF THEM GO TO

01:03:45.821 --> 01:03:47.490
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.992
MONTHS TO A YEAR. AND THE ONES

01:03:50.059 --> 01:03:51.494
THAT REALLY EXERCISE THEIR

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:52.628
INITIATIVE AND LOOK FOR

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.597
TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT MEETS

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:56.165
THEIR NEEDS WILL PURPOSELY

01:03:56.232 --> 01:03:57.800
CHOOSE ONE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S

01:03:57.867 --> 01:03:58.834
ONE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:00.803
TEACHERS TRUCK DRIVING SKILLS.

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:02.271
SO THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO GO

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:04.040
INTO A PARTICULAR JOB- THEY CAN

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:05.374
ACTUALLY LOOK FOR TRANSITIONAL

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.276
HOUSING THAT HAS A CONNECTION

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:11.247
TO THAT PARTICULAR- JOB. GROUP

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.949
IF YOU WILL OR OCCUPATION SO

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.584
THAT THEY CAN GET MORE RAINING

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:16.052
WHILE THEY'RE STILL IN SORT OF

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.887
A SEMI STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.388
THAT'S PROVIDING HOUSING AND

01:04:19.455 --> 01:04:21.224
THEY'RE NOT HAVING TO. TRY TO

01:04:21.290 --> 01:04:22.692
MULTI TASK AND FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:23.859
THEIR NEXT MEAL COMES FROM

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.094
OTHER DOING JOB TRAINING WHILE

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.462
THEY'RE GETTING THEIR I. D. IT

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.664
CETERA ETCETERA SO. THERE ARE

01:04:28.731 --> 01:04:30.933
THINGS IN THE SYSTEM I CENTER

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.735
GROWTH AND ARE BUILT IN TO TRY

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.437
TO A SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.439
HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT ARE TWO

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:37.773
OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.976
THEY'RE GOING TO FACE AND SO

01:04:40.042 --> 01:04:42.511
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I THINK-

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.113
I WOULDN'T CALL IT A WRAPAROUND

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:45.781
NECESSARILY THAT SOMEBODY COMES

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:46.782
IN HOLDEN BY THE HAND AND TAKES

01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:48.484
CARE OF ALL THAT. BUT THERE ARE

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.453
SEVERAL DIFFERENT AVENUES THAT

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:56.592
THEY CAN PROCEED DOWN. TO

01:04:56.659 --> 01:04:57.159
OBTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:59.161

GOOD WORK AND THEN ALSO- GARDEN

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:24.053
PATHWAYS IN KERN COUNTY BECAUSE

THEY ACTUALLY GO OUT AND HAVE

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:27.790
THE ABILITY TO MEET- WITH L.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.325
INDIVIDUALS BEFORE THEY ARE

01:05:29.392 --> 01:05:31.260
RELEASED- SO THAT THEY CAN TRY

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.129
TO GET THEM- INTO PROGRAMS THAT

01:05:33.195 --> 01:05:34.697
WOULD BE BENEFICIAL HELPFUL AND

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:37.266
EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS AND CITY

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.100
SERVE ALSO IN OUR COMMUNITY

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:39.669
THEY ALSO HAVE A- RELATIONSHIP

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:41.070
WITH THE COLLEGES TO DO SOME

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:42.772
TRAINING SO. I MEAN I THINK

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:43.739
THERE ARE GOOD THINGS OUT THERE

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:45.107
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:45.708
THAT YOU GUYS WERE LOOKING AT

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.644
THAT ASPECT I HAVE A QUESTION

01:05:48.711 --> 01:05:51.113
SPECIFICALLY FOR MISS AS

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:54.317
DILATORY A YEAR I'VE MA'AM YOU

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.918
ARE OBVIOUSLY A NEW TO THE

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.687
BOARD AND- I KNOW THAT YOU WENT

01:05:57.753 --> 01:05:58.821
THROUGH EXTENSIVE TRAINING

01:05:58.888 --> 01:06:00.022
NIGHT MY COLLEAGUE I DID ASK

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:00.956
ABOUT TRAINING BUT I DIDN'T

01:06:01.023 --> 01:06:04.360
HEAR THAT. THE COMMENT M. IF

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:05.995
THIS WAS SPECIFICALLY IT BUT

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.930
AND YOU WENT THROUGH SPECIFIC

01:06:07.997 --> 01:06:09.832
TRAINING IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:12.101
YOU FOUND HELPFUL- THAT WAS

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.236
BENEFICIAL ANYTHING HE THOUGHT

01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:16.639
WAS A WASTE OF TIME A SO THAT

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:20.609
WE CAN IMPROVE ON TRAINING-

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:21.177
THAT. FOR COMMISSIONERS WHEN

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.011
THEY GO FORWARD. I DON'T THINK

01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.480
THAT NOTHING THAT I. WAS NOT

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.715
TRAINED ON IT WAS A WASTE OF

01:06:25.781 --> 01:06:27.416
TIME I THINK I'M IT'S VERY

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.452
INSIGHTFUL AND- YOU KNOW COMING

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.654
FROM NEVADA. TRAININGS ARE A

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.090
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- BECAUSE

01:06:34.156 --> 01:06:36.959
CALIFORNIA IS DIFFERENT IN- IN

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:39.362
THEIR LAWS AND- FACTORS ARE

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:42.832
CONSIDERED AS WELL SO. I THINK-

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.200
WE HAVE HAD VERY VALUABLE

01:06:44.266 --> 01:06:46.402
TRAININGS. AND I THINK THAT AS

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.637
I. CONTINUE WITH MY CAREER AS A

01:06:48.704 --> 01:06:50.306
COMMISSIONER AND I CONTINUED

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.842
ATTENDING TRAININGS- I CONTINUE

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:54.510
TO LEARN MORE ONE TRAINING THAT

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:57.646
I THOUGHT WAS VERY INSIGHTFUL

01:06:57.713 --> 01:06:59.215
REGARDS TO OF PEOPLE WITH

01:06:59.281 --> 01:07:02.051
DISABILITIES- AND I CAN'T

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.786
REMEMBER THE TOP OF MY HEAD-

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:05.621
THE INSTITUTION THAT HELPS WITH

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:07.823
BRAILLE. AND KNOWING THAT THEY

01:07:12.094 --> 01:07:14.930
LEGALLY BLIND- THAT OPENED UP

01:07:14.997 --> 01:07:16.699
MY EYES ON THE RESOURCES THAT

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.534

RESOURCES ARE THERE. AND- I

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:31.106
YOUTH OFFENDER PAROLE HEARINGS.

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:33.242
RESULTED IN A DECISION TO GRANT

01:08:33.309 --> 01:08:35.377
RELEASE AND I'M JUST CURIOUS.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.846
HAS THERE BEEN ANY FOLLOW UP OR

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.047
IS THERE SOME DATA THAT CAN

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.983

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.318
HAS BEEN AND IS THERE ANY OTHER

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.919
THING THAT WE CAN DO MORE FOR

01:08:43.986 --> 01:08:45.321
YOUTH OFFENDERS. THANK YOU

01:08:45.387 --> 01:08:46.789
ALLEGE- COMMISSIONER BARTON

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.357
TAKE THAT FIRST I SAW HIS HAND

01:08:48.424 --> 01:08:50.426
FIRST AND SENATOR WE WILL- AS A

01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.461
COMMITTEE FOLLOW UP. AND ASK

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:55.831
THAT QUESTION OF THE SYSTEM TO

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:57.399
GET SOME OF THAT DATA THANK YOU

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.901
BUT ARE YOU READY HAD

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:00.236
COMMISSIONER BARTON. I JUST

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:01.537
WANT TO VERIFY T'S A DIFFERENT

01:09:01.604 --> 01:09:03.873
SYSTEM. SO THE USE OF TORY

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:06.075
HELLO MORE DIFFERENT THAN US.

01:09:06.141 --> 01:09:08.410
AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY SEE

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.946
ANYONE THAT'S- SEEKING PAROLE

01:09:11.013 --> 01:09:13.916
FROM SEE YA- SO WE WOULDN'T

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:14.917
HAVE THOSE STATISTICS THERE IS

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.119
A SEPARATE BOARD AND I THINK

01:09:17.186 --> 01:09:18.487
IT'S MUCH SMALLER THAN OURS. I

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:19.421
THINK THERE'S MAYBE TWO OR

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:20.656
THREE MEMBERS THAT DO ALL THE

01:09:20.723 --> 01:09:22.157
PAROLE HEARINGS FOR ARGUES THE

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:23.359
FORTIES I THINK IT'S A GREAT

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:25.361
QUESTION. IT'S JUST NOT ONE

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:27.062
THAT WE'RE CONFRONTED WITH-

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.797
BECAUSE WE DON'T WORK WITH THAT

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:31.901
ENTITY. SO TO THAT DEGREE I WE

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.102
COULDN'T PROVIDE THAT TO YOU

01:09:33.168 --> 01:09:36.472
FROM OUR BOARD- SO I THINK IT'S

01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:38.173
A GOOD QUESTION I THINK IT'S

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:38.707
ONE THAT COULD BE DIRECTED

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:42.177
TOWARDS- CERTAINLY THE USEFUL.

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:45.414
PAROLE JUBILATE OF SEE YA.

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:46.849
HELLO COMMISSIONERS- BUT THAT'S

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:48.918
NOT A GROUP THAT WE DEAL WITH

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:49.952
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUTH

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:51.153
OFFENDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:52.021
SOMEONE WHO COMMITTED THEIR

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:53.889
CRIME POTENTIALLY A TWENTY FIVE

01:09:53.956 --> 01:09:55.491
OR YOUNGER. BUT TYPICALLY WE

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.126
SEE IN BETWEEN THE AGES OF

01:09:57.192 --> 01:09:58.294
EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE WHEN

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.663
THEY'RE COMING TO PRISON. EVERY

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:06.302
NOW. AND THEN WE'LL SEE SOMEONE

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:06.969
THAT'S BEEN A FEW YEARS AND WHY.

01:10:07.036 --> 01:10:09.038
BEFORE THEY TRYING. TO IT IS IN

01:10:09.104 --> 01:10:10.639
THEN STILL THERE NOT PULLING OF

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:12.942
SEE WHY THERE THROUGH OUR IN.

01:10:13.008 --> 01:10:15.411
UP ALSO IN THE BOARD PRO

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:18.180

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.316
YOU THAT BACK IN. WOULD BE A

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:22.818
DIFFERENT SOURCE ABSOLUTELY SIR

OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE CORRECT

I'VE ACTUALLY HAD TWO TRAININGS

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:26.128
NOW- IN THE LAST THREE YEARS

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:28.430
SPECIFIC TO THIS AREA AND- BUT

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:29.965
FOR ME IT I LOOK A LITTLE

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:31.366
DEEPER THAN THAT AS FAR AS OUR

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.868
ANALYSIS OF THE INDIVIDUALS

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:34.736
THAT COME BEFORE US. AND WHEN

01:14:34.803 --> 01:14:37.639
I'VE HAD- TRANSGENDER. AND

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:45.681
OTHER. ONCE A NONTRADITIONAL-

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:47.683
SINCE YOU WERE IN PRISON THAT

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.852
ARE VIEWED BY THE REST OF THE

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.220
POPULATION AS A POTENTIAL

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.454
VICTIM THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.522
TAKE VERY MUCH INTO

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:55.724
CONSIDERATION AS THE IG WE HAD

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.693
SEVERAL COMPLAINTS AND

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.261
INVESTIGATIONS ARE CARRIED OUT

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.396
BY OUR OFFICE OF ABUSES THAT

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.131
OCCURRED AND I KNOW THE WORDS

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:04.533
COULD PROBABLY SPEAK TO THIS AS

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.602
WELL AND SO WHEN I'M LOOKING AT

01:15:06.668 --> 01:15:09.204
SOMEONE'S RECORD WHERE THEY

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.740
WERE A POTENTIAL VICTIM BECAUSE

01:15:11.807 --> 01:15:17.246
OF THEIR- GENDER PREFERENCE OR-

01:15:17.312 --> 01:15:19.314
BY THE REST OF THE POPULATION.

01:15:19.381 --> 01:15:22.050
YOU MIGHT SEE MUTUAL COMBATS

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.485
FOR EXAMPLE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK

01:15:23.552 --> 01:15:24.720
AT IT YOU REALIZE IT WASN'T A

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:25.954
MUTUAL COMBAT IT WAS THIS

01:15:26.021 --> 01:15:28.056
PERSON BEING VICTIMIZED. SO I

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.024
THINK YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.392
INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU'RE

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.860
LOOKING AT THE RECORD

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.428
ESPECIALLY THEIR DISCIPLINE

01:15:33.495 --> 01:15:35.297
RECORD AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.199
THE ACTUAL DETAILS UNDERLYING

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.868
IT AND APPLY WHAT YOU KNOW FROM

01:15:39.935 --> 01:15:41.970
YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WAS GOING

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:45.407
ON. BEHIND THE SCENES- WHERE

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:46.808
THEY WERE BEING VICTIMIZED AND

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.011
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IS REAL

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.513

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.882

POPULATIONS BUT- IT'S SOMETHING

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:01.323
THAT I DEFINITELY TAKE INTO

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.925
CONSIDERATION WHEN I'M LOOKING

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:06.428

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.429

PROCESS WITH INDIVIDUALS- THAT

01:34:21.689 --> 01:34:24.558
ARE ACTUALLY PRODUCING OUR FOOD.

01:34:24.625 --> 01:34:28.496
THANK YOU CENTER GROVE I AM.

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.031
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FOR ME

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:34.068
HAS REALLY BEEN TO UNDERSTAND-

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:36.437
HOW THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:39.807
WORKS- AND TO THAT EXTENT I

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:42.510
HAVE SPENT SOME TIME AND I HOPE

01:34:42.576 --> 01:34:44.345
TO SPEND EVEN MORE TIME AND

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:45.679
GETTING TO REALLY KNOW AND

01:34:45.746 --> 01:34:47.815
SPEAK TO YOU THE AGRICULTURAL

01:34:47.882 --> 01:34:50.651
INDUSTRY UP AND DOWN THE SAN

01:34:50.718 --> 01:34:54.021
JOAQUIN VALLEY- ONE OF THE- THE

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:58.125
KEY ASPECTS HERE IS THAT. WHEN

01:34:58.192 --> 01:35:02.296
WE HAVE RULES OR ARE IN THE

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:04.765
RULE MAKING PROCESS. IT IS

01:35:04.832 --> 01:35:06.567
IMPORTANT TO EVERY STAKEHOLDER

01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:08.402
GETS OF WASTE AND THAT WE

01:35:08.469 --> 01:35:10.538
REALLY- MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:12.039
CHANGES THAT WE PROPOSE ARE

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:16.043
PRACTICAL AND THAT IF- IF

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.814
CERTAIN- DISPROPORTIONATE HARM

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.816
IS GOING TO HAPPEN TO YOU LET'S

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:24.151
SEE A SMALL FARMER FOR EXAMPLE

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:26.187
THAT WE ADDRESS THAT WITH THE

01:35:26.253 --> 01:35:28.189
INCENTIVES NECESSARY TO

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:31.659
TRANSITION- THAT BUSINESS

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:34.929
PERSON INTO- BEING IN

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.163
COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT WE ARE

01:35:36.230 --> 01:35:38.499
ABOUT TO PROPOSE SO I

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:41.569
DEFINITELY DON'T THINK THAT. I

01:35:41.635 --> 01:35:45.573
AM IN THIS POSITION TO- DRIVE

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:49.710
ANYONE OUT OF BUSINESS HOWEVER

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:52.313
I DO THINK FAYE- ONE OF THE

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:54.315
THINGS THAT HAS STRUCK ME SO

01:35:54.381 --> 01:35:57.985
MUCH AS I'VE MET FARMERS- FROM-

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.187
FRESNO COUNTY IS THAT THEY'RE

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.922
PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY WANT

01:36:01.989 --> 01:36:04.058
TO PROBLEM SOLVE WITH US. AND

01:36:04.125 --> 01:36:05.559
SO MY GOAL IS REALLY TO GIVE

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.495
THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT

01:36:07.561 --> 01:36:09.897
AND- AND THAT WE ALSO WHEN

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:12.333
RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE OR WHEN

01:36:12.399 --> 01:36:14.034
THEY'RE NEEDED TO HELP

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:16.070
TRANSITION SOMEONE INTO

01:36:16.137 --> 01:36:17.938
COMPLIANCE THAT WE WORK

01:36:18.005 --> 01:36:19.874
TOGETHER WITH OUR STAT

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.510
LEGISLATURE WITH OUR STATE

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:25.079
REGULATORY IN AGENCY- WHICH IS

01:36:25.146 --> 01:36:28.082
CARB AND- WHAT I'M PUSHING FOR

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.817
IS MUCH MORE COLLABORATION WITH

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:33.454
OTHER- REGULATORY BODIES- SO

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:36.290
THAT WE ALL TOGETHER REALLY-

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:37.358
GARNER THOSE RESOURCES

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:40.227

01:41:17.438 --> 01:41:20.207
POSITION TO TRY TO DEAL WITH

01:41:20.274 --> 01:41:22.042

MEETING AND THEN. THAT'S WHERE

01:41:27.815 --> 01:41:30.317
I THOUGHT I'D I TAKE IT IN

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:30.918
ADDITION TO THE OTHER SANDERS

01:41:30.984 --> 01:41:33.220

YOU'RE GOING TO PROCEED ON THAT

01:41:39.993 --> 01:41:42.262
BECAUSE SOME OF THAT SPLIT

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:45.299

FROM A STARTING PLACE OF

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:56.543
COMMONALITIES RATHER THAN

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.679
DIFFERENCES. AND I DO THINK

01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:01.648
THAT OUR SHARED- PASSION FOR

THAT HE'S DONE A REALLY GOOD

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:22.102

THE ENTIRE BOARD CAN REALLY-

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:37.784
CAN REALLY SUPPORT. AND I WILL

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:41.588
HAVE TO SAY THAT- EVEN AS A AS

01:42:41.655 --> 01:42:43.123
I MENTIONED TO YOU SENATOR EVEN

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.925

ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES. AND

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:53.667
MORE. AT OUT POSITIONS FOR-

01:42:53.734 --> 01:42:55.669
PEOPLE THAT ARE MONOLINGUAL

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:57.471
SPANISH SPEAKING AND I THINK

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.239
THAT THAT THE FACT THAT THAT

01:42:59.306 --> 01:43:01.208
THAT- RESEARCH THAT ADDITIONAL

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.977
RESOURCE PASSED UNANIMOUSLY

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:06.947
REALLY SPEAKS TO HOW AS A GROUP

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.650
WE ARE LOOKING TO HOW TO SOLVE

01:43:09.716 --> 01:43:12.452
THESE COMPLEX ISSUES TOGETHER-

01:43:12.519 --> 01:43:13.720
ONE OF THE THINGS IN TERMS OF

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:15.389
WHEN WE DON'T AGREE ON

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:18.091
SOMETHING- I THINK THEY- I

01:43:18.158 --> 01:43:20.761
HAVE. I HAVE TRIED TO INVEST

01:43:20.827 --> 01:43:21.895
MORE TIME AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S

01:43:21.962 --> 01:43:23.630
BEEN VERY DIFFICULT SINCE WE

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:26.533
ARE- IN ASSUMING FIREMEN'S I

01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.001
REALLY HAVE TRIED TO SPEND TIME

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:30.003
GETTING TO KNOW MY FELLOW BOARD

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.606
MEMBERS- BECAUSE I DO THINK

01:43:32.673 --> 01:43:34.808
THAT RELATIONSHIPS MATTER. WHEN

01:43:34.875 --> 01:43:37.210
IT COMES TO THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:40.480
THAT WE HAVE WHEN IT COMES TO A

01:43:40.547 --> 01:43:41.014
WHAT'S HAPPENING DURING A

01:43:41.081 --> 01:43:45.852
MEETING- MY APPROACH IS REALLY-

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:48.989
FOR ME ALWAYS- KEEPING TRUE TO

01:43:49.056 --> 01:43:51.091
MY INTEGRITY IN TERMS OF. OF

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:52.926
WHAT I KNOW AND I THINK THAT MY

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.795
FELLOW BOARD MEMBERS EVEN WHEN

01:43:54.861 --> 01:43:57.097
WE HAVE DISAGREED. BECAUSE THEY

01:43:57.164 --> 01:43:58.599
KNOW I AM COMING FROM A PLACE

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:00.634
WHERE I HAVE I HAVE I'M

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.836
SPEAKING TO MY VALUES AND MY

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:04.204
PERSPECTIVE AND THEY'RE

01:44:04.271 --> 01:44:06.306
SPEAKING TO THERE'S- I THINK WE

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:08.008
CAN STILL WE STILL APPRECIATE

01:44:08.075 --> 01:44:09.176
EACH OTHER AT THE END OF THE

01:44:09.242 --> 01:44:11.578
DAY BECAUSE- WE ARE BOTH

01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:13.246
APPROACHING FROM THAT LEVEL OF

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.983
INTEGRITY- AND SO I DO THINK

01:44:16.049 --> 01:44:18.819
THEY- IT IS A CHALLENGE

01:44:18.885 --> 01:44:21.288
BECAUSE- YES WE DO HAVE. MANY

01:44:21.355 --> 01:44:23.924
VARIED- POLITICAL VIEWS AND

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:27.828
DEFINITELY- DIFFERENT- VISIONS

01:44:27.894 --> 01:44:30.530
OF HOW POLICY SHOULD BE- LOOK

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.366
AT BUT I DO THINK THAT AT THE

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:34.568
END OF THE DAY ARE COMMON-

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:36.370
PASSION FOR THE VALLEY ALONG

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:38.839
WITH- AN EXECUTIVE OFFICER

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:40.440
WHO'S TRYING TO BRING PROGRAMS

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:43.543
