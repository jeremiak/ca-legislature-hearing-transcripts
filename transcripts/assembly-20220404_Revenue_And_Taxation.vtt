00:35:19.217 --> 00:35:20.485
HAPPEN TO HAVE AN INVESTMENT

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:25.122
PARTICULAR INDUSTRY --

00:35:25.656 --> 00:35:28.192
SO WHAT I DO I USED BASED

00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:29.060
ON MY KNOWLEDGE OF THESE

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.561
TYPES OF PROGRAMS I THOUGHT

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.864
WE COULD TWEAK THE NEC

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:35.266
TO ALLOW RESTAURANTS AND BARS

00:35:35.333 --> 00:35:36.767
TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM

00:35:36.834 --> 00:35:38.002
I THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:39.504
THE POLICY REASON AT THE TIME

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.472
THAT THEY WERE EXCLUDED --

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:42.974

GET THROUGH -- HOPEFULLY THE

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:03.361
NEXT COUPLE YEARS THE PROGRAM

00:36:03.427 --> 00:36:04.762

THE TIME PERIOD I'VE I STE I

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:09.800
SPECULATE THAT THESE RESTAURANTS

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.169
AND BARS NEED TO HELP -- I DO

00:36:12.236 --> 00:36:14.205

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:21.846
SOME OF MY BARTENDERS THAT WORK

REPRESENTED SAMPLE OF THE TYPE

00:36:30.655 --> 00:36:32.690
OF INDUSTRY SO I DO THINK IT'S

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.358
A MEASURED APPROACH I THINK IT

00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:36.594

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:41.766
WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY WHAT I

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:42.934
MEANT BY THAT IS IS THAT YOU

FIFTY PERCENT OF THE MINIMUM

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:54.065
WAGE -- AND THAT WOULD SEEM

00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:56.467
TO INDICATE THAT THEY'RE

00:38:56.534 --> 00:38:58.469
BEING HIRED AT MINIMUM WAGE

00:38:58.536 --> 00:38:59.737
THEY CAN BE HIRED AT MINIMUM

00:38:59.804 --> 00:39:02.273
WAGE IS THAT CORRECT THE

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.341
IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:06.110
WHAT WHAT'S INTERESTING ARE AND

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.779
WHAT THE BARS IS AND RIGHTFULLY

00:39:08.846 --> 00:39:10.481
SO THE -- MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:12.116
IF I USE MY BARS AN EXAMPLE DO

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:13.718
GET THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT THEN

00:39:13.784 --> 00:39:15.686
THEY GET A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.722
OF MONEY IN TIPS I DO BELIEVE

00:39:17.788 --> 00:39:19.490
THE -- AND THAT'S HOW THEY GET

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.659
TO THE SIX FIGURE AND THAT'S WHY

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.394
WE WERE THINKING LIKE LAUREN IT

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.497
FOR THE -- THE RESTAURANT

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:29.200
INDUSTRY -- I ALSO DO BELIEVE

00:39:29.266 --> 00:39:31.035
THAT THERE'S LIKE SIX OR

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.303
SEVEN POLICY REASONS ON

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:34.605
THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM --

00:39:35.539 --> 00:39:37.274
IN ONE OF THEM IS LIKE HIRING

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:39.276
A CERTAIN WAGE I DO FIND THOUGH

00:39:39.343 --> 00:39:40.945
THAT -- ONCE AGAIN IN THE

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.713
RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THERE ARE

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:44.348
AVERAGE SALARIES WELL OVER FIFTY

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.317
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FOR THE

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:47.785
BARTENDER PERHAPS THE PEOPLE

00:39:47.852 --> 00:39:49.487
ARE THE -- THAT THE BARTENDERS

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:51.122
AND THE -- YOU KNOW I GUESS

00:39:51.188 --> 00:39:51.989
IN THE CASE OF RESTAURANT THE

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.592
WAITERS BUT YES WE THOUGHT

00:39:54.658 --> 00:39:55.693
THAT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE THAT

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.762
TWEAK TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WELL

00:39:57.828 --> 00:39:59.897
BUT YOU STILL HAVE PEOPLE WHO

00:39:59.964 --> 00:40:01.832
WORK IN THE BACK DOING THE

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.868
DISHES PREPARING THE MEALS

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:07.004
-- I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

00:40:07.338 --> 00:40:08.506
SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD ONLY

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.741
GET THE MINIMUM WAGE WHEN WE'RE

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:13.711
SUBSIDIZING THEIR HIRING -- IS

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:16.080
THERE A IS THERE SOMETHING

00:40:16.147 --> 00:40:16.781
YOU COULD SAY IT WOULD

00:40:16.847 --> 00:40:18.082
MAKE ME MORE COMFORTABLE

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:21.652
YOU KNOW I WOULD

00:40:23.821 --> 00:40:25.289
WELL SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

00:40:25.356 --> 00:40:26.390
MANY OF THE RESTAURANTS I KNOW

00:40:26.457 --> 00:40:27.391
THAT RIGHT NOW THOUGH IF YOU'RE

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:29.059
LOOKING AT THE COOKS AND THE NON

00:40:29.126 --> 00:40:30.928
THAT THE NON DIRECT STAFF THE

00:40:30.995 --> 00:40:33.297
WAGES HAVE ACTUALLY GONE UP --

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:36.500
THE THE PRIMARY DRIVER HERE

00:40:36.567 --> 00:40:38.369
IS IS THAT THE CREDIT STARTS

00:40:38.435 --> 00:40:39.670
REALLY THAT WHAT THE PROBLEM

00:40:39.737 --> 00:40:40.971
WAS BEFORE THE CREDITS STARTED

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.373
BEYOND HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:43.340
OF THE MINIMUM WAGE WHICH WAS

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.308

AN HOUR SO THE THOUGHT PROCESS

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:53.884
ONCE AGAIN WOULD BE TO LOWER

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.452
THAT SO THAT WE WOULD BE GETTING

00:40:55.519 --> 00:40:56.720
CREDIT FOR THOSE PEOPLE MAKING

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:58.255

MY BAR IS LIKE IN THAT YOU KNOW

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.840
IT IT ACTUALLY DOESN'T MAKE

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.408
MONEY THAT MUCH AND RECENTLY

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:25.776
HAS MADE ANY MONEY BUT LIKE WHEN

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:26.944
IT WAS AT ITS PEAK IT'S WELL

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:28.145
OVER A COUPLE MILLION WHICH IS

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.147
THE -- YOU'RE CONSIDERED SMALL

00:42:30.347 --> 00:42:32.216
BUT IT'S STILL IN IN WHEN YOU

00:42:32.283 --> 00:42:34.285
LOOK AROUND AND MANY OF THE --

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:35.920
I MEAN WE DO CONSIDER OURSELVES

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:37.221
AS THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT

00:42:37.288 --> 00:42:38.389
AND WE HAVE PROBABLY LIKE A

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:39.590
DOZEN CLIENTS THAT ARE ON THIS

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.892
KIND OF SIMILAR BUCKET -- IN THE

00:42:42.126 --> 00:42:43.294
YOU KNOW WITH TWENTY TO THIRTY

PEOPLE THEY'RE MAKING OVER THAT

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:47.031
MINIMUM SO THAT'S WHY WE JUST

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:48.032
THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WE COULD

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:50.768
JUST -- ELIMINATE THAT CAP

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.937
AND NOW ALSO WE ARE WORKING WITH

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.538
INDIVIDUALS AND MY UNDERSTANDING

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:57.341
IS UNLIKE IN THE RETAIL

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.044
SPACE MANY OF THE

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:01.879
-- RESTAURANTS YEARS INDEPENDENT

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.414
OPERATORS THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.883
LARGE CHANGE THERE ARE SOME AND

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.084
THEN AS A RETAIL SPACE I MEAN

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.485
LIKE YOUR STORES AND SO THE

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.321
ORIGINAL INTENT WAS TO EXCLUDE

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.256
LIKE YOUR YOUR BIG BOX RETAILERS

00:43:12.323 --> 00:43:13.791
AND PERHAPS LIKE YOUR LARGE

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:16.927
RESTAURANTS THE VAST MAJORITY

00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:18.228
OF OUR RESTAURANTS THOUGH IN

00:43:18.295 --> 00:43:19.830
CALIFORNIA ARE DOES THEY'RE

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:22.032
NOT THAT THE BIG CHAINS BUT

00:43:22.099 --> 00:43:23.701
THEY DO GO BEYOND THAT LIMIT

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.003
AND SO THIS LEGISLATION WAS

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:26.937
JUST TRYING TO ACCOMMODATE

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.238
THAT LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:29.573
THAT GO BEYOND THAT SMALL AND

00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:32.810
BUT THE PROGRAM WAS TRYING TO

00:43:32.876 --> 00:43:35.145
THE PROGRAM I MEAN BASICALLY

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.513
WANTED TO EXCLUDE RESTAURANTS

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.948
EXCEPT SMALL RESTAURANTS AND

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.149
RETAIL AND YOU'RE SAYING THE

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:41.885
RESTAURANTS I GUESS HOW SHOULD

00:43:41.952 --> 00:43:43.520
BE INCLUDED THAT RETAIL STILL

00:43:43.587 --> 00:43:45.723
SHOULDN'T BE INCLUDED BECAUSE

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.758
THE RESTAURANT JOBS PAY MORE

00:43:47.825 --> 00:43:50.194
IS THAT I MEAN IT IT'S IT'S

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:51.829
WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.831
GOING SORT OF AGAINST WHAT THE

00:43:53.897 --> 00:43:56.667
ORIGINAL STATED POLICY GOALS OF

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.372
WHAT I'M SAYING IS IS THAT

THERE'S A LARGE GROUP THAT ARE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.876
CONSIDERED SMALL IN RESTAURANTS

00:44:05.943 --> 00:44:07.011
UNLIKE LIKE THE RETAIL

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:08.445
SPACE WERE PROBABLY THE VAST

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.114
MAJORITY OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.415
IN CALIFORNIA IS FROM LARGE

RETAILERS RESTAURANTS IT'S AN

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.585
INTERESTING SPACE WHERE I GUESS

THE BARS AND MY CLIENTS DO MAKE

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.726
OVER THAT THRESHOLD THAT WAS PUT

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:24.461

NUMEROUS EVENTS AT THE MUSEUM

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:57.734
AND -- CERTAINLY I DON'T

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:58.969
WANT TO HAVE TO PAY A HUNDRED

00:53:59.035 --> 00:54:01.338
THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IN

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.840
PROPERTY TAX ON THE OTHER HAND

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.876
IT'S A TRADITIONAL TAX --

00:54:08.712 --> 00:54:11.147
-- RULE THAT TO

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:12.949
THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE COMPETE

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:15.652
WITH THE PRIVATE ORGANIZATION

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.388
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF HOTELS IN

00:54:19.189 --> 00:54:21.825
OAKLAND THAT HOST THESE TYPES OF

00:54:21.891 --> 00:54:24.461
MEETINGS NOW I CAN SEE

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:25.762
IT'S PART OF THE MISSION

00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.697
IF IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:30.200
POSTING NONPROFITS GOVERNMENT

00:54:30.266 --> 00:54:32.802
ORGANIZATIONS AT A LOWER COST

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.572
THEN PERHAPS THESE OTHERS

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:38.541
COULD THAT PROBABLY MADE THAT

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.977
THAT MIGHT MAKE IT A BIT EASIER

00:54:41.044 --> 00:54:43.013
TO DO THIS ON THE OTHER HAND TO

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.280
THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE HOSTING

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.750
CORPORATIONS WHO COULD

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.686
YOU KNOW ALSO GO TO A --

00:54:50.487 --> 00:54:52.422
THE HOTEL YOU'RE COMPETING THEN

00:54:52.489 --> 00:54:54.457
PERHAPS UNFAIRLY WITH A HOTEL

00:54:54.524 --> 00:54:56.459
AND ITS BUSINESS I DON'T KNOW

00:54:56.526 --> 00:54:58.361
WHAT TO MAKE OF THIS -- I'M

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:01.097
CERTAINLY -- MY HEART IS

00:55:01.164 --> 00:55:03.033
WITH YOU I'M JUST NOT SURE

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.003
HOW TO HANDLE THE THE SAP

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.271
TRADITION OF HOW WE HANDLE

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:10.140
TAXES PERHAPS YOU ARE ONE OF

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:12.242
YOUR EXPERTS CAN DISCUSS THAT

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:15.612
I'LL ASK THE EXPERT TO SPEAK ON

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:18.682
THIS BUT I WILL SAY THAT UNLIKE

00:55:18.748 --> 00:55:20.350
OTHER NONPROFITS THE DIFFERENCE

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:22.318
WITH AT MUSEUMS IS THAT THEIR

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:25.121
SPACE IS ACTUALLY THE CAP

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:26.289
SOLUTION OF THEIR MISSION AND

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:27.791
WHAT THEY'RE INTENDED USE AT

00:55:27.857 --> 00:55:29.125
THE INTENDED USE AND PURPOSE

00:55:29.192 --> 00:55:31.528
OF THEIR NONPROFIT IS -- AND

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:32.662
AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

00:55:32.729 --> 00:55:34.297
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO APPLY

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:37.033
THE EXEMPTION TO THE POSSESSORY

00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:38.935
INCOME TAX B. POSSESSORY TAX

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.737
BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

00:55:40.804 --> 00:55:42.372
THEY REGARDLESS OF WHO THEY

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.074
ARE HOSTING THEY'RE STILL USING

00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.909
THAT SPACE FOR THE PURPOSE OF

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.711
BETTERING THE COMMUNITY AND

00:55:47.777 --> 00:55:48.878
CONTRIBUTING TO THE COMMUNITY

00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:51.081
SO I THINK WE KNOW THE MAJORITY

00:55:51.147 --> 00:55:53.049
OF THE EVENTS THAT WE ATTEND ARE

00:55:53.116 --> 00:55:55.685
LARGELY A FOR A FOR NONPROFIT

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:56.886
PURPOSES WHEN PEOPLE COME

00:55:56.953 --> 00:55:57.954
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE

00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:59.823
COMING FROM A CORPORATION OR A

00:56:00.056 --> 00:56:01.558
NONPROFIT OR COMMUNITY MEMBER

00:56:01.624 --> 00:56:03.326
YOU ARE ALSO BENEFITING FROM

00:56:03.626 --> 00:56:04.761
THE EXPERIENCE THEY RECEIVE

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.929
WHILE IN THAT SPACE AND I THINK

00:56:05.995 --> 00:56:07.297
THAT THAT ALLOWS FOR THERE TO

00:56:07.363 --> 00:56:08.465
BE SOME EXEMPTION I ALSO THINK

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:09.899
THAT THERE'S A CHALLENGE THAT

00:56:09.966 --> 00:56:11.568
THERE'S NOT UNIFORMITY AND THE

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:13.269
APPLICATION OF THIS ACROSS THE

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:16.005
ACROSS THE STATE LOS ANGELES

00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:17.707
COUNTY FOR INSTANCE DOESN'T

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:20.677
APPLY THIS TAX AND AND AT OUR

00:56:21.044 --> 00:56:22.846
-- ALAMEDA COUNTY IS SUBJECT

00:56:22.912 --> 00:56:24.013
TO IT AND THERE SHOULD BE

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.515
EQUITY IN THAT APPLICATION

00:56:25.782 --> 00:56:27.684
OKAY THANK YOU IF I CAN JUST

00:56:27.751 --> 00:56:29.119
ADD ONE OF THOSE ADDITIONAL

00:56:29.185 --> 00:56:30.253
PIECES OF LANGUAGE THAT WE

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.554
REALLY WORK TO CLARIFY IN THE

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:33.690
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS THAT

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:35.125
THESE EVENTS THAT THE ATTENDEES

00:56:35.191 --> 00:56:36.860
OF THESE EVENTS WOULD NEED TO

00:56:36.926 --> 00:56:39.729
HAVE ACCESS TO THE COLLECTIONS

00:56:39.796 --> 00:56:41.931
THE EXHIBITION OR EDUCATIONAL

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:43.299
OFFERINGS SO IF THERE WAS A

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:45.001
MUSEUM THAT HAD A BIG BANQUET

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.302
ROOM NEXT TO IT AND PEOPLE

00:56:46.369 --> 00:56:47.403
WENT IN AND OUT OF THERE FOR

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.205
AN EVENT AND NEVER SAW THE

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.573
COLLECTION NEVER EXPERIENCED

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.775
AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM NEVER

00:56:51.841 --> 00:56:53.409
SAW AN EXHIBITION THAT WOULD BE

00:56:53.476 --> 00:56:55.278
DIFFERENT SO WE WOULD BE HOLDING

00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:58.314
MUSEUMS ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURING

00:56:58.381 --> 00:56:59.382
THAT EVEN IF IT IS A CORPORATE

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:01.351
EVENT OR A YOU KNOW A FAMILY

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.219
EVENT THAT WE'RE MAKING THE

00:57:03.286 --> 00:57:04.687
SPACES OF THE EXHIBITIONS THE

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:05.955
COLLECTIONS ON THE EDUCATIONAL

00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:07.257
PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO THOSE

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:08.458
VISITORS AND PART OF THE

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:10.360
EXPERIENCE BUT NOW MY HEART

00:57:10.426 --> 00:57:11.728
AND BRAIN CAN BE WITH YOU

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:16.032
YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

00:57:16.099 --> 00:57:17.867
FROM THE COMMITTEE ALL

00:57:17.934 --> 00:57:19.102
RIGHT I I HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:57:19.169 --> 00:57:21.971
QUESTIONS HOW CAN WE MAKE

00:57:22.038 --> 00:57:24.240
SURE OR OR VOID THIS INCENTIVIZE

00:57:24.307 --> 00:57:26.042
-- MUSEUMS TO CUT SHORT THEIR

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:28.845
HOURS TO THE PUBLIC TO HOLD MORE

00:57:28.912 --> 00:57:31.281
EVENTS I THINK WE CAN SPEAK

00:57:31.347 --> 00:57:33.316
TO K. PASSED PRACTICING AND

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:34.784
IF YOU COULD SHARE WHAT YEAR

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.654
-- YOU KNOW WE ARE

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:39.222
WE I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD

00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:40.990
FIND THAT MUSEUMS WOULD EVER

00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.525
ACTUALLY REDUCE THEIR PUBLIC

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:43.726
EVENTS I MEAN MOST OF THESE

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.795
EVENTS EITHER TAKE PLACE IN

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:46.996
THE EVENINGS WHEN MUSEUMS ARE

00:57:47.063 --> 00:57:48.998
TYPICALLY OPEN AND MOST MUSEUMS

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.166
YOU KNOW TO TRY TO PROVIDE AT

00:57:50.233 --> 00:57:52.302
LEAST ONE EVENING -- OF PUBLIC

00:57:52.368 --> 00:57:53.970
ACCESSIBILITY OR THEY'RE IN

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:55.238
SPACES THAT CAN BE USED FOR THE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:56.439
MUSEUM IS ALREADY OPEN TO THE

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:58.608
PUBLIC SO I THINK THERE WOULDN'T

00:57:58.675 --> 00:57:59.976
BE THE INCENTIVE FOR MUSEUMS TO

00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:01.511
REDUCE PUBLIC HOURS FOR THESE

00:58:01.578 --> 00:58:03.746
EVENTS IT'S JUST OFFERS ANOTHER

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.648
IT'S KIND OF ANOTHER ENTRY

00:58:05.715 --> 00:58:07.917
POINT -- ANOTHER WAY TO BRING

00:58:07.984 --> 00:58:10.420
VISITORS IN AND MAKES YOU KNOW

00:58:10.486 --> 00:58:12.021
REALLY LEVERAGE THEIR SPACES TO

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.456
BEST ADVANTAGE THROUGHOUT THE

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.158
COURSE OF THE WEEK I WOULD ALSO

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:17.460
ARGUE THAT THE INCIDENCE OF AT

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:20.430
ALLOWING MUSEUMS TO SAVE

00:58:20.496 --> 00:58:21.664
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:24.734
DOLLARS IN IN IN PAID AT TAXES

00:58:24.801 --> 00:58:26.135
COULD ACTUALLY GIVE THEM AN

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.871
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE OPERATING

00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:29.439
REVENUE AVAILABLE TO INCREASE

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.241
THEIR HOURS AND AND MAKE IT MORE

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:33.409
OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THAT'S THE

00:58:33.476 --> 00:58:36.312
POINT AT AND THEN --

AS ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:27.516
ROUGHLY THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.352

AND -- DO YOU THINK THIS

01:33:13.955 --> 01:33:15.690
MIGHT CREATE A PRECEDENT THAT

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:18.025
WE WOULD BE SUBSIDIZING MODERATE

01:33:18.092 --> 01:33:20.061
INCOME HOUSING THROUGH THE TAX

01:33:20.127 --> 01:33:22.263

01:33:27.301 --> 01:33:28.803
THE CONCERN WE HAVE IN THIS

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:30.371
COMMITTEE I WOULD THERE IS

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:32.773
SOME PRECEDENT -- THAT AGENCIES

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:33.941
FORMALLY KNOWN AS REDEVELOPMENT

01:33:34.008 --> 01:33:35.810
AGENCIES USED TO HAVE A BUDGET

01:33:35.876 --> 01:33:37.278
THAT WAS SET ASIDE FOR LOW

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.846
AND MODERATE INCOME HOMES AND

01:33:38.913 --> 01:33:39.780

01:33:43.851 --> 01:33:46.354
EXIST AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.923
MODERATE INCOME -- THE INTENSE

01:33:48.990 --> 01:33:50.458
TO LIVE IN THOSE HOMES ALSO I

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:51.592
BELIEVE JUST LAST YEAR IN THE

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:53.260

01:33:55.863 --> 01:33:57.431
MODERATE INCOME THAT HAS A

01:33:57.498 --> 01:33:58.566
TAX CREDIT PROGRAM IS JUST

01:33:58.632 --> 01:34:00.634
FOR RENTAL -- SO HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:34:00.701 --> 01:34:02.203
DOESN'T HAVE SUCH EVEN AT LEAST

01:34:02.269 --> 01:34:03.637
THERE'S TWO PROGRAMS I'M AWARE

01:34:03.704 --> 01:34:04.905
OF THAT EVENT FOR RENTAL BUT

01:34:04.972 --> 01:34:06.440
AGAIN NONE FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:34:06.707 --> 01:34:08.709
-- SINCE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES

01:34:08.776 --> 01:34:10.711
AND AND -- AND WENT AWAY

01:34:10.778 --> 01:34:11.846
THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY FROM BUT

01:34:11.912 --> 01:34:13.314
SPECIFICALLY FOR PRODUCTION

01:34:13.614 --> 01:34:15.916
OF -- HOMEOWNERSHIP AND

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.385
AT I MEAN THERE IS A PRETTY

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:19.587
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.655
-- SALARY REQUIREMENTS FROM

01:34:21.722 --> 01:34:23.624
BEGINS WITH HER LOOKING AT LOW

01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:26.394
INCOME FOR A FOUR PERSON

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.462
HOUSEHOLD AS OPPOSED TO MODERATE

01:34:28.529 --> 01:34:29.964
INCOME I MEAN YOU'RE WHAT WE

01:34:30.031 --> 01:34:31.265
WOULD BE WITH THE TAX CODE

01:34:31.332 --> 01:34:32.833
SUBSIDIZING PEOPLE THAT MIGHT

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.135
BE MAKING YOU KNOW DEPENDING

01:34:34.201 --> 01:34:36.203
ON THE AREA THAT YOU'RE IN

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.439
-- WELL OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:40.107
THOUSAND IS IS THAT CORRECT

01:34:41.609 --> 01:34:43.044
MADAM YEAH MAN I'M SURE I MEAN

01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:45.146
IT DEPENDS ON WHAT COUNTY WERE

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:46.580
TALKING ABOUT OBVIOUSLY WHAT

01:34:46.647 --> 01:34:47.848
THE ERROR IN THE AREA MEDIAN

01:34:47.915 --> 01:34:50.284
INCOME IS YOU KNOW OF OF

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.786
THAT COUNTY YOU KNOW THAT AREA

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.087
BUT AGAIN JUST WOULD LIKE TO

01:34:53.154 --> 01:34:55.089
STRESS THE COMMENTS THAT I MADE

01:34:55.156 --> 01:34:56.457
DURING MY EARLIER TESTIMONY IN

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.725
THAT IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:59.927
AREA FOR INSTANCE TWENTY SIX

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:02.029
PERCENT OF CURRENT RENTERS HAVE

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:03.064
AN INCOME OF OVER A HUNDRED

01:35:03.130 --> 01:35:04.432
AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:06.801
YEAR AND THERE IS THERE'S NO

01:35:06.867 --> 01:35:08.035
HOUSING STOCK FOR THEM TO MOVE

01:35:08.102 --> 01:35:09.870
INTO SECUELA THINK THERE'S AN

01:35:09.937 --> 01:35:11.405
ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR MODERATE

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.374
INCOME AT IT BUT THE QUESTION IS

01:35:13.441 --> 01:35:15.943
DOES IT WITH THIS THIS --

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.079
WELFARE EXEMPTION ISN'T REALLY

01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:21.048
DESIGNATED FOR LOWER INCOME

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:23.851
-- -- PEOPLE THAT WE ARE

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.686
TRYING TO FIND HOUSING FOR

01:35:25.753 --> 01:35:27.188
SALE HISTORICALLY MEN I'M

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:28.756
SURE THAT'S TRUE I MEAN THAT

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.592
CAN I DECIDE -- IT'S MY

01:35:31.659 --> 01:35:32.860
UNDERSTANDING AND I I NEED TO

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:33.961
LOOK MORE INTO THIS BUT IT'S

01:35:34.028 --> 01:35:35.062
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT SAME

01:35:35.129 --> 01:35:36.697
TAX CREDIT THOUGH IS USED FOR

01:35:36.764 --> 01:35:38.632
MODERATE INCOME RENTAL PROPERTY

01:35:38.966 --> 01:35:40.734
SO IT'S ALREADY BEING USED FOR

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.336
THAT PURPOSE THIS WOULD JUST

01:35:42.403 --> 01:35:44.538
EXTEND IT FOR THAT THE -- FOR

01:35:44.605 --> 01:35:46.273
SALE PROPERTY AN ADDITION THE

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.708
NUMBERS REALLY HAVEN'T KEPT UP

01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:48.609
WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

01:35:48.676 --> 01:35:50.077
HOUSING MARKET SO IF THE INTENT

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:51.278
REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:35:51.345 --> 01:35:52.680
PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING PEOPLE

01:35:52.980 --> 01:35:54.748
CAN AFFORD TO LIVE SOMEWHERE --

01:35:54.815 --> 01:35:56.350
IT STILL SERVES THE SAME PURPOSE

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:58.919
-- THAT WAS INTENDED FOR --

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:01.422
AND -- AND BECAUSE THIS IS

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:03.290
REALLY ONLY THE TAX RELIEF

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:04.892
DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE

01:36:04.959 --> 01:36:05.759
PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY THROUGH

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.761
CONSTRUCTION IT'S NOT INPUT TO

01:36:07.828 --> 01:36:09.964
THE ONES THAT WITHOUT PROPERTIES

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:12.233
PURCHASED IT'S NO LONGER IT THEN

01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.634
THEY START PAYING TAXES ON IT SO

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:14.869
IT'S REALLY A VERY SMALL AMOUNT

01:36:14.935 --> 01:36:16.237
OF TIME TO HELP THOSE DEVELOPERS

01:36:16.303 --> 01:36:17.538
GET THE PROJECTS ON THE GROUND

01:36:18.839 --> 01:36:20.141
I DO WANNA REMIND THE COMMITTEE

01:36:20.207 --> 01:36:21.742
THAT THE HOMEOWNERS REGARDLESS

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.010
OF THEIR INCOME LEVEL DO YOU

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.311
HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES IT'S

01:36:24.378 --> 01:36:25.613
REASSESSED AT THE POINT THAT

01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.481
THEY TAKE OVER THAT THEY GET

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:28.782
A PROPERTY TAX BILL I'D LIKE

01:36:28.849 --> 01:36:31.118
RENTAL UNITS WILL REMAIN EXEMPT

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:32.219

THE ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:40:43.504 --> 01:40:44.838
WHEN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY OVER

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:47.040
STATE TAX POLICY OVER HOW TAXES

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.776

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:51.278
THIS TO TURNER'S DISCRETIONARY

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:53.480
INVESTMENTS IN OUR STATE THAT

01:40:53.547 --> 01:40:55.616
HURTS CALIFORNIA THAT COST US

01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:57.484

LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:02.956
SUSPEND THE OTHER WELL FOR THREE

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:04.958
YEARS -- BECAUSE OF THE COVERT

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:06.660
NINETEEN EMERGENCY ABSOLUTELY

01:41:06.727 --> 01:41:09.329
MADE SENSE AT THE TIME HOWEVER

01:41:09.396 --> 01:41:11.165
AS IT IS TURNED OUT WE NOW

01:41:11.231 --> 01:41:12.433
KNOW THAT THE SUSPENSIONS

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.501
WERE ENTIRELY UNNECESSARY

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:17.304
IN FACT OVER THE LAST TWO

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:18.772
FISCAL YEARS ACCORDING TO THE

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:20.741
NONPARTISAN LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS

01:41:20.808 --> 01:41:22.409
AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.011
THERE HAVE BEEN GENERAL FUND

01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:26.947
SURPLUSES EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:29.650
BILLION DOLLARS AND THERE

01:41:29.716 --> 01:41:30.951

EXPECTED AGAIN THIS YEAR ALL

01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.921
RIGHT NOW I THINK THE ESTIMATE

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:35.088

THAT THE STATE NEEDED THE FUNDS

01:41:48.836 --> 01:41:50.237
AND WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT AT

01:41:50.304 --> 01:41:51.371
SOME POINT THEY COULD ACTUALLY

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.373
RECOUP THESE TAX BENEFITS IN THE

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:56.076
FUTURE BUT WE KNOW NOW

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.644
THAT THE NFL SUSPENSION WAS

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.413
NOT NECESSARY FOR COMPANIES

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:00.747
LIKE MY CLIENT AND FOR OTHERS

01:42:00.814 --> 01:42:02.082
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR

ABLE TO RECOUP THE INVESTMENTS

01:42:05.519 --> 01:42:07.020

01:46:30.784 --> 01:46:31.852
BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD

01:46:31.918 --> 01:46:33.754
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT I'M

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.055
YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME THAT'S

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:36.790
VERY HARD TO ARGUE WITH THE

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:38.959
FACT THAT IN IN AN AREA WHERE

01:46:39.025 --> 01:46:40.594
WE HAVE A SURPLUS ONE OF THE

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:41.528
FIRST THINGS WE SHOULD DO WITH

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.330
THAT SURPLUS IS EFFECTIVELY

01:46:43.396 --> 01:46:44.798
PAY DOWN I THINK YOUR WITNESS

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:46.066
SCRIBE IS THE ZERO INTEREST

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:48.435

A MOMENT WE THOUGHT WE ARE

01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:51.171
FACING A DEFICIT I'M AND THEN I

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.540
ALSO JUST WANT TO -- HONED

01:46:53.607 --> 01:46:54.808
IN ON ANOTHER POINT THAT YOU

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:55.976
MADE WHICH I THINK IS RELEVANT

01:46:56.042 --> 01:46:58.044
TO THIS BUT I THINK I'M ALSO

01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:00.647
RELEVANT TO OUR TAX POLICY MORE

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:01.948
BROADLY WHICH IS AROUND JUST

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:03.383
THE IMPORTANCE OF CERTAINTY

01:47:03.817 --> 01:47:05.452
I'VE FORWARD AND NOT JUST YOUR

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:07.988
COMPANY BUT YOU COMPANIES LARGE

01:47:08.054 --> 01:47:09.890
AND VERY SMALL ACROSS THE STATE

01:47:09.956 --> 01:47:11.558
AND -- I THINK THAT THAT IS

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:13.860
SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT WE HAVE

01:47:13.927 --> 01:47:16.997
TO ENSURE THAT ODD BUSINESSES

01:47:17.063 --> 01:47:18.932
FEEL LIKE THEY CAN CONTRAST OUR

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:20.367
POLICIES ARE GOING TO REMAIN

01:47:20.433 --> 01:47:22.435
CONSISTENT AND THAT THEY CAN

01:47:22.502 --> 01:47:24.871
MAKE INVESTMENTS AND DECISIONS

01:47:24.938 --> 01:47:27.307

-- THANK YOU FOR THAT POINT AND

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:30.744

THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS

01:47:45.926 --> 01:47:47.127
BECAUSE CERTAINLY WE WOULDN'T

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:48.495

01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:51.731

TWO FROM LAST YEAR AND --

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:24.297
M. HIS SITUATION WAS THAT HE

01:48:24.364 --> 01:48:25.599
HAD BEEN IN THE FOR HIS FAMILY'S

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.033
FAMILY FARM OPERATION NOT A

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:28.969
BIG FARMER BUT YOU KNOW THE OWN

01:48:29.035 --> 01:48:31.238
THREE BIG PARCELS OF LAND IN THE

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:32.572
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THE CENTRAL

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:35.041
VALLEY AND -- BECAUSE FORMING

01:48:35.108 --> 01:48:36.376
SO TOUGH THIS IS TO BE IN THE

01:48:36.443 --> 01:48:37.677
DROUGHT WATER SHORTAGES AND

01:48:37.744 --> 01:48:38.511
EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN LOSING

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:40.280
MONEY HIS PRODUCTION CREDIT

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:42.115
ASSOCIATION HE WAS HE WAS IN

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.450
A REAR SOME PAYMENTS AND THEY

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.986
WERE GONNA FORECLOSE IF YOU DID

01:48:46.052 --> 01:48:48.088
RAISE CAPITAL AND SO WHAT HE

01:48:48.154 --> 01:48:49.389
DID IN TWENTY TWENTY C. TOOK THE

01:48:49.456 --> 01:48:50.323
PARCEL OF LAND THAT HAVE BEEN

01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:51.391
IN THE FAMILY THE LONGEST WHICH

01:48:51.458 --> 01:48:52.993
THEY OWN FREE AND CLEAR AND YOU

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:54.461
SOLD IT BECAUSE HE NEEDED THE

01:48:54.527 --> 01:48:55.695
MONEY TO PAY OFF THE PRODUCTION

01:48:55.762 --> 01:48:57.397
CREDIT ASSOCIATION TO STAY

01:48:57.464 --> 01:48:59.432
IN BUSINESS AND OF COURSE HE

01:48:59.499 --> 01:49:01.568
DIDN'T REALIZE AT THE TIME --

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:02.936
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T PAY LOBBYIST

01:49:03.003 --> 01:49:04.604
LIKE ME UP IN SACRAMENTO GIVEN

01:49:04.671 --> 01:49:06.439
REPORTS EVERY MONTH BUT HE

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:07.540
DIDN'T REALIZE THE TIME THAT

01:49:07.607 --> 01:49:09.309
HIS AND A WELL OF THE STATE

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:10.577
ALL THOSE LOSSES EVEN CARRIED

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:11.878
ON THE BOOKS IT WAS DRIVING

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:13.780
THIS DECISION HE COULDN'T USE

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:15.548
SO HIS TAX BILL ENDED UP BEING

01:49:15.615 --> 01:49:17.284
OVER I THINK WAS A HUNDRED AND

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.618
SIXTY FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:49:18.685 --> 01:49:20.120
THOUSAND DOLLARS HIGHER THAN IT

01:49:20.186 --> 01:49:21.788
WOULD HAVE BEEN AND THAT'S MONEY

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:23.023
THAT HE GOT A PUT BACK INTO HIS

01:49:23.089 --> 01:49:25.025

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:26.893
FRANCHISE TAX BOARD NOW HE'S

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:27.894
NEVER GOING TO GET A CHANCE TO

01:49:27.961 --> 01:49:29.195
MAKE THAT BACK UP BECAUSE YOU

01:49:29.262 --> 01:49:31.031
KNOW THE FARMING IS WHAT IT IS

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.766
AND HE'S GETTING ON IN LIFE SO

01:49:33.033 --> 01:49:34.434

THEY KNOW ABOUT CASES BECAUSE

01:49:55.522 --> 01:49:57.490
AS I SAID -- THAT IT WE

01:49:57.557 --> 01:49:58.858
