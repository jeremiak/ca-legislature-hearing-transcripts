THE BUDGET FOR IT.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.415

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:30.801
AND SAW NO ACTUAL REAL DOLLAR

00:39:30.868 --> 00:39:32.369
INCREASES IN THEIR FUNDING --

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:33.738
AND SO WE'RE SEEKING TO RECTIFY

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.005
THIS BY ASKING THAT THE

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:36.207
LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED SET

00:39:36.273 --> 00:39:39.143
ASIDE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THE

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:40.945
AVAILABLE FUNDING.

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:41.445
THE SECOND CHART THAT WE

00:39:41.512 --> 00:39:42.246
PROVIDED SHOWS YOU HOW THE

00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:43.948
PROPOSAL WOULD WORK BASED ON THE

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.183
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO FINISH

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.651
OUT THE THREE YEARS FOR AS

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.153
PROPOSED BY GOVERNOR BROWN.

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.488
AND ALSO TO DO THIS ON AN

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.156
ONGOING BASIS WERE ACTUALLY

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:53.324
ASKING THAT AN EXTRA TWO MILLION

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:54.792
DOLLARS BE ALLOCATED TO THE

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.594
PROGRAM EACH YEAR SO THAT THE

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.796
10% WE ARE ASKING --

00:39:58.863 --> 00:39:59.797
FOR IS MADE UP OF THE MONEY

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:00.798
PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS HAVE

00:40:00.865 --> 00:40:01.766
TRADITIONALLY RECEIVED FROM

00:40:01.832 --> 00:40:03.267
Sí

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:05.002
FUNDING AND BY DOING IT THAT WE

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:05.936
WERE MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:07.238
PULLING MONEY AWAY FROM ANY

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.539
OTHER PROGRAM TYPES WHO MAY HAVE

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.574
BENEFITTED FROM THE CHANGE TO

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:13.244
THE RULES.

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.445
SO I JUST WANNA AND BY SHARING A

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.446
TWO REASONS WHY I THINK IT'S

00:40:15.513 --> 00:40:16.480
VERY IMPORTANT THAT THIS THE

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:17.681
BEST A ADEQUATELY FUND PEDIATRIC

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:20.084
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS THE FIRST TO

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:20.584
AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR

00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:22.086
PEDIATRIC ACT PEDIATRICIANS

00:40:22.153 --> 00:40:23.954
RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE.

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:24.922
ACUTE CARE TRAINING WITH

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.024
CHILDREN ADOLESCENTS AND ALLOWS

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:27.892
THEM TO HANDLE A LOT OF

00:40:27.958 --> 00:40:29.226
CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNITY

00:40:29.293 --> 00:40:30.461
WITHOUT HAVING TO REFER A CHILD

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:31.962
TO URGENT CARE OR TO A

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:32.530
SPECIALIST.

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:34.165
MRS MORE HELPFUL FOR FAMILY

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:35.432
MEMBERS AND ALSO CAN BE A COST

00:40:35.499 --> 00:40:37.234
SAVINGS TO PAY YEARS INCLUDING

00:40:37.301 --> 00:40:38.102
THE STATE --

00:40:38.169 --> 00:40:38.769
AND SO WE THINK IT'S REALLY

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.070
IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE ADEQUATE

00:40:40.137 --> 00:40:41.305
NUMBERS OF PEDIATRICIANS IN THE

00:40:41.372 --> 00:40:42.206
COMMUNITY.

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.974
SECONDLY PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:47.378
PROGRAMS STEVE DRAMATICALLY LES

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.979
FEDERAL FUNDING THAN OTHER

00:40:49.046 --> 00:40:51.015
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO OVER 50%

00:40:51.081 --> 00:40:52.950
OF PEDIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS

00:40:53.017 --> 00:40:54.084
ARE FUNDED BY CHILDREN'S

00:40:54.151 --> 00:40:55.619
HOSPITALS TO RECEIVE NO.

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:57.388
LITTLE TO NO MEDICARE GRADUATE

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:58.923
MEDICAL EDUCATION FUNDING --

00:40:58.989 --> 00:41:00.658
AND AS A RESULT AND THE FUNDING

00:41:00.724 --> 00:41:01.592
THAT THEY DO RECEIVE FROM THE

00:41:01.659 --> 00:41:02.693
FEDERAL LEVEL DOESN'T COVER

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.794
THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.129
THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITALS MAKE UP

00:41:05.196 --> 00:41:06.397
THE DIFFERENCE --

00:41:06.463 --> 00:41:08.132
AND AS A RESULT THEY CAN OFFER

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.334
FEWER SLOTS TO PEDIATRICIANS SO

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:11.702
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH OF

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:12.937
THESE REASONS AT THE STATE MAKE

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:14.371
SURE THAT PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS ARE

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.906
RECEIVING A FAIR SHARE OF THE

00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:17.374
FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE AND WE

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:18.342
HOPE THAT YOU WILL INCLUDE OUR

00:41:18.409 --> 00:41:19.777
PROPOSAL IN FINAL BUDGET.

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:21.979
THANK YOU.

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:24.315

AND SOME FAMILIARITY WITH

00:41:29.253 --> 00:41:30.120

IN THOSE THOSE SAID THAT --

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.263

WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T TAKE A

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:51.141
POSITION AT THIS TIME BUT S

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:53.410
COMPETITIVELY.

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:53.978
FUNDED PROGRAM COMPETITIVELY

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:56.647
BASED PROGRAM AND THE CHIPS KIND

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:58.415
OF FALL WHERE THEY MAY --

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.517
I I DO KNOW THAT I'VE PERSONALLY.

00:42:00.584 --> 00:42:02.052

RESIDENCY PROGRAMS I KNOW THAT

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:05.689
SOME PROGRAMS ARE GETTING SOME

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:06.090
FUNDS [inaudible]

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:13.931
BUT TO SO WHY SHE MAY BE --

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.165
WELL ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE MANY

00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:15.900
QUESTIONS MEGLIO.

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:19.403
FINANCE.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.738
WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:21.705

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:45.229
COMPETITIVE PROGRAM BUT WE'RE

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:45.829

CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S THAT'S

00:47:04.521 --> 00:47:06.323
SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.158
EXPLORED OBVIOUSLY NOT ONLY IN

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:09.459

TALKING A LOT MORE ABOUT SORT OF

THERE.

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:24.608
SO I SUFFERS OF I WANT TO SAY

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:25.776
THAT -- I

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:26.543

KNOW S

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:31.281
N'T DO IT SPECIAL TO BY

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:32.516
SPECIALTY AND MINUTES FOR

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:33.717
PRIMARY CARE BUT WE DON'T DO

00:47:33.784 --> 00:47:35.619
SPECIAL A SPECIALTY AND THERE'S

00:47:35.686 --> 00:47:36.386
CERTAIN AND I THINK YOU RECENT

00:47:36.453 --> 00:47:37.354
CONCERNS --

00:47:37.421 --> 00:47:38.789
AND I I AND I I WOULD SURE SOME

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:40.691
OF THAT THAT WE START SLICING IT

00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:43.126
BY SPECIALTY THAT CREATES THAT

00:47:43.193 --> 00:47:46.063
MAY CREATE SOME INHERENT ISSUES --

00:47:46.129 --> 00:47:53.470
SO BUT YOU ALSO SEND YOUR TEST

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:55.405
CRITERIA THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU

00:47:55.472 --> 00:47:56.974
THINK IS DRIVING THIS FUNDING

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.508
AWAY FROM PEDIATRIC THAT YOU

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:00.544
THINK WOULD BE.

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:02.045
AN APPROPRIATE ARE HAVE AS WELL

00:48:02.112 --> 00:48:03.914
THAT THAT MEANT THAT YOU WOULD

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:05.349
MIGHT CONSIDER TO BE OUT ON

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:08.018
FAIRS TIED UP RIGHT WORD BUT BUT

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:10.153
MAYBE LEADING TO VISITS. TO

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:11.154
OUTCOMES THAT.

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.589
ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF PEDIATRIC

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:13.991
TRAINING GATHERS TWO CRITERIA

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:15.926
THAT WERE ADDED ONLY ONE OF

00:48:15.993 --> 00:48:16.827
WHICH IS COMING TO MY MIND RIGHT

00:48:16.893 --> 00:48:17.661
NOW -- BUT

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:20.097
IT WAS THAT ONE WAS THE CRITERIA

00:48:20.163 --> 00:48:21.298
FOR AT LEAST EIGHT HOURS IN A

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:22.966
CONTINUITY CARE CLINIC AND

00:48:23.033 --> 00:48:24.601
PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF

00:48:24.668 --> 00:48:25.602
ALL OF THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS

00:48:25.669 --> 00:48:27.404
ARE PART OF THEM THEY NEVER

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:28.805
EXCEED MORE THAN.

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:29.940
FOUR SO AND IT WAS --

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:31.842
TEN POINTS THAT WAS ZERO OR TEN

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:33.243
WHETHER YOU MET THAT CRITERIA

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.011
AND NOT BECAUSE ALL THE

00:48:34.077 --> 00:48:35.012
PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS TO JUST

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.380
AUTOMATICALLY SCORED TEN POINTS

00:48:36.446 --> 00:48:37.514
LOWER.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:38.582
THERE WAS ONE OTHER ONE THAT I'M

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.750
DRAWING A BLANK ON THAT ALSO

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:42.386
IMPACTED PEDIATRIC PROGRAMS AND

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.054
WHEN WE REACHED OUT.

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:45.455
TO OUR SPOT STAFF LAST YEAR THE

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:47.057
INDICATION THAT WE GOT WAS THAT

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:48.725
THIS WAS DONE INTENTIONALLY. TO

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:50.093
PULL MONEY AWAY FROM PEDIATRIC

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.529
PROGRAMS TOWARDS THE OTHER TYPES

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.998
AND THE RATIONALE WAS THAT 1100%

00:48:55.065 --> 00:48:56.433
LIKE FAMILY MEDICINE PROGRAMS

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.535
RECEIVED MOST OF THE BENEFIT OF

00:48:58.602 --> 00:48:58.735
THAT.

00:48:58.802 --> 00:49:01.571
SHIFT BUT THOSE PROGRAMS LIKE

00:49:01.638 --> 00:49:02.873
1100% OF THEM GOING TO PRIMARY

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.074
CARE WHERE IT'S IN ANY GIVEN

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.276
YEAR IT'S ABOUT 50% OF PEDIATRIC

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:07.577
PROGRAM OF PEDIATRICIANS WILL GO

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.413
INTO PRIMARY CARE SO THEY SAW

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.047
THAT IS A BETTER BANG FOR THEIR

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:10.847
BUCK.

00:49:10.914 --> 00:49:14.518
THE PROBLEM IS THAT AS YOU KNOW

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:17.387
PEDIATRICIANS AND THAT WE FOR

00:49:17.454 --> 00:49:19.289
NOT TRAINING THEM WE WILL SLOWLY

00:49:19.356 --> 00:49:21.058
LOSE THE NUMBER THAT WE HAVE IN

00:49:21.124 --> 00:49:22.159
THE COMMUNITY --

00:49:22.225 --> 00:49:23.727
SO WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER WAYS

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:24.995
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR FUNDING A

00:49:25.062 --> 00:49:26.797
PRIMARY CARE SLOT. FOR EXAMPLE

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.598
POSITIONS FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.734
THAT'S DISTRIBUTING BUT PROP

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:32.169
FIFTY SIX MONEY LOOKS AT HOW

00:49:32.235 --> 00:49:33.737
MANY PLACEMENTS YOU HAVE IN A

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.038
PRIMARY KATIE CARE SETTING FIVE

00:49:35.105 --> 00:49:36.239
YEARS OUT AND THEY ALSO AWARD

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:37.641
EXTRA POINTS.

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.442
FOR IF YOU HAVE A PRIMARY CARE

00:49:38.508 --> 00:49:40.444
TRACKING YOUR RESIDENCY PROGRAM

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.245
SO THERE'S WAYS TO CREATE POINT

00:49:42.312 --> 00:49:43.680
SYSTEMS THAT REWARD HOSPITALS

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:44.981
THAT TRAIN PRIMARY CARE

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:47.984
PEDIATRICIANS WITHOUT DISRUPTING

00:49:48.051 --> 00:49:48.685
THE MONEY TO ANOTHER TYPE

00:49:48.752 --> 00:49:48.985
[inaudible]

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:51.955
OKAY.

00:49:52.022 --> 00:49:53.824
ALL RIGHT WELL AND HOPEFULLY

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:55.926
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN

00:49:55.992 --> 00:49:57.928
LOOK AT NOW I MAYBE I'LL MAKE A

00:49:57.994 --> 00:49:59.229
PERSONAL COMMENTS ON WHO

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.864
ACTUALLY SERVED ON THE CREATION

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:02.599
COUNSEL FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:04.601
EDUCATION THAT --

00:50:04.668 --> 00:50:06.236
PERHAPS ACTUALLY PEDIATRICS

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:07.571
CONSIDER INCREASING OUTPATIENT

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.473
TRAINING --

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:10.107
ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU'RE CREATE

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:12.709
FELLOWSHIP IN HOSPITALS TRAINING

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:14.444
IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A DETACHED

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:15.145
SINCE -- BUT

00:50:15.212 --> 00:50:16.380
THAT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BUT THAT'S

00:50:16.446 --> 00:50:17.247
SOMETHING THE PEDIATRIC ME AS A

00:50:17.314 --> 00:50:18.615
FIGURE OUT --

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:25.288
BUT YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT --

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:29.493
THEM WE SERVE JIMMY DOLLARS --

00:50:29.559 --> 00:50:31.428
TO ALSO BE SURE PEOPLE ARE GOING

00:50:31.495 --> 00:50:32.496
TO PRACTICE IN THE AREAS OF NEED

00:50:32.562 --> 00:50:33.797

AND SO BETWEEN NOW AND MAY

00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:24.347
REVISE HEALTH LEADERS TO BE SOME

THAT YOU RAISE I WOULD JUST

00:56:56.679 --> 00:56:58.248
MENTION THAT WE'RE REALLY JUST

00:56:58.314 --> 00:56:59.549
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT I THINK I'M

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:02.152
FIRST WHAT THE NEED IS.

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:03.286
AND SO JUST WE DID OF LIKE A

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:04.687
BACK OF THE ENVELOPE NUMBERS

00:57:04.754 --> 00:57:07.056
ASSUMPTION AND IF EVERY HEALTH

00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:08.558
CENTRE APPLIED FOR A GRANT AND

00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.193
GOT OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.261
DOLLAR GRANT NOT SAYING THAT

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.462
SHOULD BE THE NUMBER --

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:14.497
THAT WOULD BE ABOUT. FOUR

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:16.199
HUNDRED AND FIFTY H. PROVIDERS

00:57:16.266 --> 00:57:17.400
STATEWIDE.

00:57:17.467 --> 00:57:19.169
SO I I AGAIN I THINK IT DEPEND

00:57:19.235 --> 00:57:20.303
THAT AND THOSE ARE JUST HEALTH

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:20.904
CENTERS AND THIS WOULD BE UP

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:22.539
THIS TO BE APPLICABLE TO PUBLIC

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.440
HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:26.042
TO SO THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.377
AROUND NUMBER.

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.344
TO GIVE YOU --

NOW BUT WE ARE INTERESTED IN AND

00:57:31.681 --> 00:57:33.216
THROUGH TRYING TO SURVEY WHAT

00:57:33.283 --> 00:57:34.684
THE NEED IS AND SEEING IF THE

00:57:34.751 --> 00:57:36.786
STOLLER AMOUNT WOULD HAVE THE

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.922
IMPACT THAT WE HOPE IT WOULD.

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:41.157
OKAY NO I MADE A PRE SHEET THAT

00:57:41.224 --> 00:57:43.092
CERTAINLY --

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:43.726
EIGHTY ENDING MADE AN EXCELLENT

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:46.729
CASE ABOUT THE NEED AND BUT I

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:48.364
THINK ALSO AS A BUDGET

00:57:48.431 --> 00:57:50.600
SUBCOMMITTEE GALLON SOMEONE SAYS

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.101

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:53.303
ALSO EXPECTED TO HAPPEN WITH

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:55.004
THAT RIGHT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:56.873
KIND OF DIFFERENCE DO SO AND I

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:59.509
REALIZED THERE'S THERE'S GOING.

00:57:59.576 --> 00:58:01.845

00:58:12.555 --> 00:58:13.056

RECRUITMENT SIGNEE INCENTIVE.

00:58:15.625 --> 00:58:17.460
FOR HOW THE OTHER RELOCATION

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:20.063
PERCENT BUT LIKE A I MEAN.

00:58:20.129 --> 00:58:21.030
I GUESS THE THING IS IS A SO YOU

00:58:21.097 --> 00:58:21.631

INCENTIVES FOR PEOPLE --

00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:24.634

THIS DAY IS THAT GOING TO BE

00:58:28.538 --> 00:58:30.240
SUFFICIENT OR PEOPLE THAT SAY

00:58:30.306 --> 00:58:31.841
WELL YOU KNOW THEN TERMS OF DON

00:58:31.908 --> 00:58:33.376
GOING SALARY OR WHATEVER

00:58:33.443 --> 00:58:34.544
BENEFITS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:35.812
GET ARE YOU ABLE TO IF YOU SEE

00:58:35.879 --> 00:58:37.447

SOME PLACE TO LIVE ONE TIME

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.252
THAT'S GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT

00:58:42.318 --> 00:58:44.153
FOR THE RETENTION I I'M ALSO

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:44.754
THINKING BUT NOT A RECRUITMENT

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:48.524
BUT SUSTAINABILITY IN TERMS OF

00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:49.859
RETENTION.

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:50.526
WELL WE RECOGNIZE ACTUALLY THAT

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:51.527
ARE THERE ARE QUITE A FEW

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.595
RETENTION STRATEGIES LOWER

00:58:52.662 --> 00:58:53.363
PAYMENT BEING AMONG THEM AND I

00:58:53.429 --> 00:58:53.897
THINK THIS IS WOULD BE A

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:55.498
COMPATIBLE STRATEGY WITH A

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.132
LONGER PAYMENT --

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:58.034
PROGRAM BUT LOAN PAYMENT IS AND

00:58:58.101 --> 00:58:59.636
IT IS IS INCOMING UPON HAVING A

00:58:59.702 --> 00:59:01.571
PROVIDER AT YOUR FACILITY THAT

00:59:01.638 --> 00:59:03.072
YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT BENEFIT.

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:04.007
TO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

00:59:04.073 --> 00:59:05.508
PROGRAMS LIKE THIS ACROSS THE

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:06.175
STATE OF FOR THAT THEY'RE VERY

00:59:06.242 --> 00:59:07.543
REGIONALIZED THERE'S A FEW

00:59:07.610 --> 00:59:09.379
HEALTH PLANS I THINK THREE THAT

00:59:09.445 --> 00:59:10.580
WE CAN NO I HAVE.

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:11.314
THAT ARE STARTING TO DO THIS

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.049
THAT ARE SEEING SUCCESSES BUT IT

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:15.251
IS RELATIVELY NEW AND THOSE ARE

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:16.419
PROGRAMS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:17.520
THE KIND OF THAT STATISTICS IN

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.755
THE OUTCOMES OF THAT.

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.790
BUT WE SEE THAT IT IS MAKING A

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:24.827
DIFFERENCE RENTS OF APPROACH.

00:59:24.894 --> 00:59:27.297
I THINK WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN.

00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:30.099
THIS YOU KNOW SAID MORE --

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:31.834

00:59:34.037 --> 00:59:34.971
THE BACK OF THE NAPKIN BACK OF

00:59:35.038 --> 00:59:35.838
THE ENVELOPE CALCULATION BUT

00:59:35.905 --> 00:59:37.840
ALSO THINKING ABOUT HOW WITH

00:59:46.082 --> 00:59:47.050
SINCE YOU SAID ONE TIME I'

00:59:47.116 --> 00:59:48.051

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:07.615
PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:08.783
RIGHT NOW.

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:12.587
WHO ARE OUT THERE AS SAID THAT --

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:13.821
WHO WHO DO WHO COULD BENEFIT

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.226
THAT AT THIS CURRENT TIME?

01:28:18.292 --> 01:28:18.960
YES SO --

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:20.228
INITIALLY IN IN OUR QUEST TO TRY

01:28:20.294 --> 01:28:21.896
TO TRACK DATA AND FIND REPORTS

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.197
ON THE OUTCOMES OF FOSTER IN

01:28:23.264 --> 01:28:24.966
HIGHER EDUCATION --

01:28:25.033 --> 01:28:26.100
WITH REGARDS TO IS --

01:28:26.167 --> 01:28:27.435
GRADUATE SCHOOL THERE'S

01:28:27.502 --> 01:28:29.570
VIRTUALLY NO DATA --

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.072
WE WERE ABLE TO FIND THE PROGRAM

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.707
AT UC DAVIS WHICH THE GARDENS

01:28:32.774 --> 01:28:35.109
PROFESSIONS PROGRAM --

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:35.743
THAT WAS A PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY

01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:38.513
TALK YOUTH WHO WERE TRANSFERRING

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:40.314
INTO GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND WE

01:28:40.381 --> 01:28:42.116
WERE ABLE TO PULL THE DATA ABOUT

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.651
THE USE THAT THE OF THE STUDENTS

01:28:43.718 --> 01:28:44.585
THAT THEY SERVE --

01:28:44.652 --> 01:28:45.820
FROM FROM THE GUARDS PROFESSIONS

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:47.221
PROGRAM --

01:28:47.288 --> 01:28:50.758
AND SO WE ESTIMATED THE A SEVEN

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:51.693
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:52.493
DOLLAR REQUEST.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.695
A BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:55.430
STUDENTS AT THE PROGRAM SERVED --

01:28:55.496 --> 01:28:57.298
AND IN PARTICULAR THOSE A WE'RE

01:28:57.365 --> 01:28:58.299
GOING INTO SOCIAL WORK DEGREES

01:28:58.366 --> 01:29:00.601
WHICH BELIEVE WAS OF ROUGHLY

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.236
OVER FORTY FIVE STUDENTS --

01:29:02.303 --> 01:29:04.138
AND SO WE YOU KNOW BASED OUR

01:29:04.205 --> 01:29:06.774
ESTIMATE OF SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:09.110
THOUSAND TOOT TOOT TO ME FIFTY

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.578
UP POTENTIAL WORK OKAY ALL RIGHT

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:11.713
SO THAT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW.

01:29:11.779 --> 01:29:13.648
AND I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I

01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:14.982
HAVE THOUGH IS THAT I MEAN.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.017
LAMBS IS RECREATE A SEPARATE

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:18.519
FUND RIGHT BUT WE ALSO WE'RE

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:19.987

YOU THAT FAST YOU SPRING UNIQUE

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:28.563
PERSPECTIVE.

BUT ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:29:29.163 --> 01:29:30.231
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE NUMBER

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:30.998
RIGHT AND ACTUALLY WE WANT TO

01:29:31.065 --> 01:29:32.633
INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS --

01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.769
WOULD IT BE A BETTER STRATEGY TO

01:29:34.836 --> 01:29:36.337
SAY THAT ACTUALLY YOU --

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.506

WE'RE NOT SURE OF WHETHER IT'S

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.420
CAN BE BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO BIG OR

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:53.054

THOSE THINGS THAT CAUSE GREATEST

01:35:01.862 --> 01:35:03.798
LEVELS OF DISABILITY OR NUMBER

01:35:03.864 --> 01:35:05.633
OF YEARS WITH DISABILITY.

EMERGING AND RE EMERGING

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:24.218
DISEASES WHICH I'M GOING TO TALK

01:35:24.285 --> 01:35:24.919
ABOUT --

01:35:24.985 --> 01:35:26.454
CONDITIONS I AM IN A MOMENT TO

PROVIDES BOTH PERCENTAGES BUT

01:36:01.155 --> 01:36:02.490
THEN RANKINGS THROUGHOUT THE

01:36:02.556 --> 01:36:03.757
STATE -- FOR

01:36:03.824 --> 01:36:05.392
THOSE INDICATORS THAT ALSO HAVE

01:36:05.459 --> 01:36:07.061
HEALTHY PEOPLE --

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:07.962
TWENTY TWENTY OUTCOMES TO SHOW

01:36:08.028 --> 01:36:09.130
HOW THE STATE IS DOING AND IN

01:36:09.196 --> 01:36:11.465
REACHING THOSE DESIRED OUTCOMES

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.767
WE ALSO DIRECTED MANAGE THEY

01:36:13.834 --> 01:36:15.669
LET'S GET HEALTHY CALIFORNIA THE

01:36:15.736 --> 01:36:17.104
STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN.

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:18.439
WHICH REPORTS ON SPECIFIC

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:20.541
INDICATORS THAT ALIGN WITH

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.976
HEALTH OUTCOME GOALS FOR

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:23.444
COLLECTIVE IMPACT THROUGHOUT THE

01:36:23.511 --> 01:36:24.879
STATE -- AND

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.447
THEN FINALLY THE SECOND EDITION

01:36:26.514 --> 01:36:27.848
OF OUR BURDEN OF CHRONIC DISEASE

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:30.184
REPORT WILL BE COMING OUT

01:36:30.251 --> 01:36:31.218
SHORTLY.

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.620
BUT WE DON'T JUST GATHER DATA

01:36:32.686 --> 01:36:33.387
FOR DATA SAKE.

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:34.522
THEY SAID WE REALLY WANT TO HELP

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:36.390
SET PRIORITIES AND WE WANT TO

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.559
DRIVE EFFECTIVE ACTION WE ALSO

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.027
HAVE A FOCUS ON PREVENTION.

01:36:40.094 --> 01:36:41.128
AND THAT MEANS THAT WE DON'T

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.696
JUST COLLECT THE INSTANCES OF

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.165
CONDITIONS OR DISEASES BUT WE'RE

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:45.533
REALLY INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHO

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:47.001
IS AFFECTED --

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:50.237
WHAT ARE THE THE THE THE BOTH A

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.872
PHYSICAL BUT OFFICE ALSO TO THE

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:53.440
INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.676
FACTORS THAT EITHER PUT SOMEONE

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:57.378
AT RISK OR PROTECT THEM --

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:59.013
AND THAT SAME DATA THAT WE

01:36:59.079 --> 01:37:00.014
GATHER CAN ALSO BE USED TO

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.782
EVALUATE THAT INTERVENTIONS THAT

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:02.683
YOU PUT IN PLACE TO TRY TO

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.251
PREVENT THESE DISEASES AND

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:06.520
CONDITIONS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:37:06.587 --> 01:37:09.523
THIS HEARING AND ALL THE LIMITED

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.492
TIME FRAME OF WHAT I'M GONNA DO

01:37:11.559 --> 01:37:12.426
IS JUST --

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:13.928
PROVIDE A FEW EXAMPLES OF WHERE

01:37:13.994 --> 01:37:15.763
CALIFORNIA'S REALLY DOING WELL

01:37:15.829 --> 01:37:17.198
IN IMPROVING WHERE WE SING GOOD

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:19.466
IMPROVEMENT BUT ALSO SEVERAL

01:37:19.533 --> 01:37:20.534
AREAS WHERE THERE ARE STILL

01:37:20.601 --> 01:37:22.203
SIGNIFICANT THREATS TO

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.871
POPULATION HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA.

01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:25.506
AND WHAT I THINK IT MIGHT TAKE

01:37:25.573 --> 01:37:26.040
TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:27.575
CHALLENGES --

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:30.344
ON THE VERY BROAD SCALE IT IN

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:31.312
TERMS OF LIFE EXPECTANCY

01:37:31.378 --> 01:37:32.580
CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY SEEN

01:37:32.646 --> 01:37:33.981
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIFE

01:37:34.048 --> 01:37:35.182
EXPECTANCY.

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.917
IN NINETEEN NINETY WE RANK

01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.652
TWENTY FOURTH AMONG STATES WITH

01:37:38.719 --> 01:37:40.955
A AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.356
SEVENTY FIVE POINT NINE YEARS.

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:45.192
ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY IN

01:37:45.259 --> 01:37:45.826
TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA RANKS

01:37:45.893 --> 01:37:47.528
SECOND ONLY TO HAWAII WITH AN

01:37:47.595 --> 01:37:48.963
AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.097
ALMOST EIGHTY ONE YEARS SO

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:51.532
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN FACT

01:37:51.599 --> 01:37:52.733
THIS WAS THE GREATEST GAIN IN

01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:56.403
LIFE EXPENSES HE OF ANY STATE

01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:57.471
DURING THAT SAME TIME PERIOD.

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.239
AND FOR CHRONIC DISEASES WE'VE

01:37:58.305 --> 01:37:59.206
SEEN -- FOR

01:37:59.273 --> 01:38:00.641
MANY OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES ARE

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:01.942
THE DEATH RATES HAVE IMPROVED

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.510
OVER TIME ID NUMBERS OF DEATHS

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:05.346
ARE DECREASING BUT THEY DO

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:06.580
REMAIN SOME OF THE MOST COMMON

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:07.948
AND COSTLY --

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.117
CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN FACT

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.919
75% OF ALL DEATHS ARE ULTIMATELY

01:38:11.986 --> 01:38:13.921
DUE TO CHRONIC DISEASES.

01:38:13.988 --> 01:38:14.922
I'M HEART DISEASE AND CANCER

01:38:14.989 --> 01:38:16.890
ALONE BECAUSE NEARLY 50% OF ALL

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:19.760
DEATHS IN IN CALIFORNIA.

01:38:19.827 --> 01:38:21.061
SOMETHING THAT'S VERY WORRISOME

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.630
FOR THE FUTURE IS THE FACT THAT

01:38:22.696 --> 01:38:24.398
ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX CALIFORNIA

01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.000
CHILDREN AND ONE IN EVERY THREE

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:28.168
TEENS IS ALREADY OVER WEIGHT OR

01:38:28.235 --> 01:38:31.171
OBESE WHICH IS I SENT A STRONG

01:38:31.238 --> 01:38:32.039
RISK FACTOR FOR FUTURE

01:38:32.106 --> 01:38:33.874
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CANCER

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:35.442
AND OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES.

01:38:35.509 --> 01:38:37.645
INCLUDING DIABETES IN FACT THE

01:38:37.711 --> 01:38:38.879
PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:41.081
CALIFORNIA'S INCREASED 34%

01:38:41.148 --> 01:38:43.517
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN.

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:45.319
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND AS OF 2069%

01:38:45.386 --> 01:38:47.254
OF ALL CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHICH

01:38:47.321 --> 01:38:48.789
IS TWO POINT SIX MILLION PEOPLE

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.457
HAVE ALREADY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH

01:38:50.524 --> 01:38:51.792
DIABETES.

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:54.561
AND AN ALARMING 46% OF ALL

01:38:54.628 --> 01:38:56.130
ADULTS ARE THIRTEEN MILLION HAVE

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:57.831
BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH THAT WITH

01:38:57.898 --> 01:38:58.932
PRE DIABETES WITHOUT

01:38:58.999 --> 01:39:00.501
INTERVENTION ON AVERAGE ONE OUT

01:39:00.567 --> 01:39:01.802
OF FOUR OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:04.438
WILL GO ON TO DEVELOP DIABETES.

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:05.572
RATES OF DIABETES ALSO DIFFER

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:07.374
SIGNIFICANTLY GEOGRAPHICALLY IN

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.310
CALIFORNIA AS DO MANY OF THESE

01:39:09.376 --> 01:39:11.011
IMPORTANT TO CONDITIONS THE RATE

01:39:11.078 --> 01:39:12.513
IN IMPERIAL COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE

01:39:12.579 --> 01:39:14.415
IS THE HIGHEST AT FOURTEEN POINT

01:39:14.481 --> 01:39:15.683
8% O ADULTS.

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:17.551
AND ITS LOWEST IN MARIN COUNTY

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.953
WITH WO POINT 6% QUITE A QUITE

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.422
A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.

01:39:21.488 --> 01:39:22.723
AND DIABETES IS ALSO DISEASE

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:24.425
WHERE WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THE

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:26.360
IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:27.261
HEALTH.

01:39:27.328 --> 01:39:29.063
DIABETES RATES AMONG WHITES IS

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:31.565
ART 7% AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:34.368
9% AND AMONG LATINOS IT'S 11%.

01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.502
AND RICHARD THREE TIMES HIGHER

01:39:35.569 --> 01:39:38.505
AMONG PEOPLE FROM HIGH SCHOOL

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:39.373
THAN THOSE THAT HAVE A COLLEGE

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.041
DEGREE AND TWICE AS HIGH IN

01:39:41.108 --> 01:39:42.576
FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING UNDER

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:44.578
THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL ALL OF

01:39:44.645 --> 01:39:46.246
WHICH OF FACT THE OPPORTUNITIES

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.549
THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE HEALTHY.

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:49.650
WE'VE SEEN SOME SIGNIFICANT

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:50.918
IMPROVEMENTS --

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.052
IN MANY CHRONIC DISEASES

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:53.654
INCLUDING CANCER HEART DISEASE

01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:54.888
HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND STROKE

01:39:54.955 --> 01:39:56.223
EACH OF WHICH RATES HAVE

01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:57.524
DECREASED --

01:39:57.591 --> 01:39:58.959
AND THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

01:39:59.026 --> 01:40:00.494
FACTORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO

01:40:00.561 --> 01:40:01.729
THIS THING AND NOT THE LEAST OF

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.964
WHICH WOULD BE THE EXPANSION OF

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:05.099
HIGH QUALITY.

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:06.567
HEALTH CARE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH

01:40:06.633 --> 01:40:08.268
CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:09.870
WELL AS PREVENTIVE SERVICES BUT

01:40:09.937 --> 01:40:11.171
CALIFORNIA'S ALSO MADE IMPORTANT

01:40:11.238 --> 01:40:12.639
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE HAD A

01:40:12.706 --> 01:40:13.907
PROFOUND EFFECT.

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.642
AND A GOOD EXAMPLE IS SMOKING

01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:17.311
SMOKING REMAINS A LEADING CAUSE

01:40:17.378 --> 01:40:18.912
OF PREMATURE DEATH DISEASE AND

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:20.547
DISABILITY EVEN THOUGH DEATHS

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:21.982
FROM LUNG CANCER BEEN DECREASING

01:40:22.049 --> 01:40:24.451
FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS --

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:25.953
THAT BUT CHANGES IN POLICY THAT

01:40:26.019 --> 01:40:26.820
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACTIVE IN

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:28.155
CALIFORNIA BOTH AT THE STATE AND

01:40:28.222 --> 01:40:29.523
LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS PRIVATE

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:31.191
HEALTH PREVENTION WORK HAVE HAD

01:40:31.258 --> 01:40:32.192
A HUGE IMPACT.

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.527
CALIFORNIA SMOKING RATES HAVE

01:40:33.594 --> 01:40:35.596
DECREASED 54% --

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:38.098
IN ADULTS DOWN TO TEN POINT 1%

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.566
AND FOUR POINT 3% IN SCHOOL

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:40.567
YOUTH.

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:42.169
AND BY TWENTY FOURTEEN LUNG

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.337
CANCER MORTALITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:40:43.404 --> 01:40:45.873
HAD DROPPED 43% AND WAS 30%

01:40:45.939 --> 01:40:46.874
LOWER THAN THE REST OF THE

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:49.676
NATION HIS ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:40:49.743 --> 01:40:51.578
IMPROVEMENTS.

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:52.279
WHEN I TURN TO SOME EMERGING

01:40:52.346 --> 01:40:54.214
ISSUES THAT I THINK DESERVE

01:40:54.281 --> 01:40:55.282
ATTENTION OPIATES AS YOU KNOW

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:56.316
ESPECIALLY DOCTOR PAN ARE --

01:40:56.383 --> 01:40:57.985
DRUGS TYPICALLY USED FOR PAIN

01:40:58.051 --> 01:40:59.987
RELIEF SUCH AS CODEINE

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.054
HYDROCODONE IN FRONT NOW.

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:02.256
DESPITE THE FACT THAT

01:41:02.322 --> 01:41:03.857
CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL RATE OF

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.092
OPIOID DISSOCIATED OVERDOSING

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:07.094
DUST IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN

01:41:07.161 --> 01:41:09.797
THAT NATIONAL RATE WE STILL HAVE

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.265
NEARLY TWO THOUSAND OVER OPIATE

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:13.167
OVERDOSE DEATHS EVERY YEAR AND

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:14.568
APPROXIMATELY EIGHT THOUSAND

01:41:14.635 --> 01:41:15.869
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

01:41:15.936 --> 01:41:16.837
VISITS.

01:41:16.904 --> 01:41:18.672
AS WELL AS OVER TWENTY FOUR

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:22.242
MILLION FIRST IN CALIFORNIA TO

01:41:22.309 --> 01:41:23.277
EAST CONTINUE TO HAVE A

01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:25.679
SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:27.648
LIKE THE NATION AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:41:27.714 --> 01:41:29.049
BATTLING OPIOID.

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.417
INCREASED YEAR PERIOD YOU SAID

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:31.919
MISUSE FOR OVER A DECADE THE

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:33.954
RECENT SHARP INCREASE THAT IS

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:35.422
YET GARNERED SO MUCH ATTENTION

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:36.457
IS LARGELY A FUNCTION OF

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:38.459
UNCHECKED AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD

01:41:38.525 --> 01:41:40.694
PER PRESCRIPTION PAIN MANAGEMENT.

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:42.329
AND WE HAD EARLY SUCCESSES IN

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:44.164
DEATH RATES TO PER PRESCRIPTION

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:46.366
ASSOCIATED OF THE OVERDOSES.

01:41:46.433 --> 01:41:48.135
HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS DESPITE

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:50.404
THOSE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS --

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:52.673
WE HAVE SEEN THE EPIDEMIC SHIFT

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.508
INCREASINGLY TO BE ASSOCIATED

01:41:54.575 --> 01:41:57.845
WITH ILLICIT DRUG USE INCLUDING

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:58.345
HEROIN AND FUNCTIONAL.

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:03.450
BUT WE DID WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS --

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:03.984
RISING RATES DO YOU HAVE

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.686
DECREASED SHARPLY SINCE TWENTY

01:42:05.752 --> 01:42:06.320
FIFTEEN AND PRESCRIPTION OPIOID

01:42:06.386 --> 01:42:06.954
ASSOCIATED DEATHS RACHED THEIR

01:42:07.020 --> 01:42:10.257
LOWEST LEVEL IN.

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:11.291
TWENTY SEVENTEEN HOWEVER HEROIN

01:42:11.358 --> 01:42:12.659
RELATED OVERDOSED US OF

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:15.729
INCREASED 97% SINCE TWENTY

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:16.897
TWELVE AND FENNEL RELATED DEATHS

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.365
HAVE INCREASED FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:19.867
23%.

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.635
THERE IS ALSO WHY GEOGRAPHIC

01:42:21.702 --> 01:42:23.370
VARIATION IN THE IMPACT OF OF

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:25.372
OPIOID CRISIS WITH OUR NORTHERN

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:26.807
RURAL COUNTIES BY HAVING

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.809
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER RATES.

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:31.411
OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES AND OF

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:33.347
COURSE ARE ARE A POPULOUS

01:42:33.413 --> 01:42:34.948
SOUTHERN COUNTIES HAVE THIS THE

01:42:35.015 --> 01:42:36.783
LARGEST NUMBERS.

01:42:36.850 --> 01:42:38.919
SUICIDE IS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT

01:42:38.986 --> 01:42:39.686
CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING

01:42:39.753 --> 01:42:40.888
CIRCLE SUICIDE RATES HAVE

01:42:40.954 --> 01:42:41.955
DECLINED IN THE NINETEEN

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.690
NINETIES BUT HAVE INCREASED IN

01:42:43.757 --> 01:42:44.892
THE MOST RECENT DECADES.

01:42:44.958 --> 01:42:46.593
AND ARE NOW DOUBLE THE HOMICIDE

01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:47.995
RATES TO SITE ACCOUNTS FOR

01:42:48.061 --> 01:42:49.930
NEARLY TWICE THE NUMBER OF

01:42:49.997 --> 01:42:51.932
DEATHS STATEWIDE AS OPIOIDS OR

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:53.400
HOMICIDES.

01:42:53.467 --> 01:42:54.968
AND IS ONE OF THE TOP TEN CAUSES

01:42:55.035 --> 01:42:57.004
OF PREMATURE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA.

01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:58.972
MAN COMMITS SUICIDE AT THREE

01:42:59.039 --> 01:43:00.541
TIMES THE RATE OF WOMEN THAT ARE

01:43:00.607 --> 01:43:01.675
TEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE A

01:43:01.742 --> 01:43:03.176
FIREARM.

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:04.244
AND WHILE THE HIGHEST RATES ARE

01:43:04.311 --> 01:43:07.314
AMONG MALES OVER EIGHTY SUICIDE

01:43:07.381 --> 01:43:08.348
IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF

01:43:08.415 --> 01:43:08.849
DEATH.

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:10.350
AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG

01:43:10.417 --> 01:43:13.587
ADULTS AGED.

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:14.221
FIFTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR MANY OF

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:15.222
THE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT SEE

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.157
HIGH RATES OF OPIOID OVERDOSE

01:43:17.224 --> 01:43:18.559
THE NORTHERN COUNTIES FOR

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.694
EXAMPLE ALSO EXPERIENCE SUICIDE

01:43:20.761 --> 01:43:22.496
RATES SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN

01:43:22.563 --> 01:43:24.898
THE STATE WIDE RATE.

01:43:24.965 --> 01:43:26.066
AND THEN FINALLY I WANT TO TALK

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:27.434
A BIT ABOUT THE RAPID RISE AND

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:28.869
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES

01:43:28.936 --> 01:43:30.304
ACROSS THE STATE.

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:31.638
OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:43:31.705 --> 01:43:34.608
CASES OF STDS WERE REPORTED IN

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:36.443
TWENTY SEVENTEEN UP 45% FROM

01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:37.711
JUST FIVE YEARS AGO.

01:43:37.778 --> 01:43:39.179
AND OF GREATEST CONCERN TO MANY

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.347
IS THE RESURGENCE OF THE

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:42.382
ENTIRELY PREVENTABLE CONDITION

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:43.850
OF CONGENITAL SYPHILIS.

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:45.152
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE WERE

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.753
SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING AT

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.922
LEAST 70% OF POTENTIAL

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:50.624
CONGENITAL SYPHILIS CASES

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:51.925
THROUGH DETECTION AND EARLY

01:43:51.992 --> 01:43:53.660
INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:54.528
THERE WERE STILL TWO HUNDRED AND

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:58.699
EIGHTY THREE CASES SYPHILIS AND

01:43:58.765 --> 01:43:59.733
TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIRTY

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.135
CIVIL DISASSOCIATED STILLBIRTH

01:44:02.202 --> 01:44:02.703
THAT'S THE HIGHEST IN TWENTY

01:44:02.769 --> 01:44:04.304
YEARS.

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.973
MOST OF THE WOMEN WHO GAVE BIRTH

01:44:06.039 --> 01:44:06.840
TO BABIES WITH CONGENITAL

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.842
SYPHILIS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:10.177
DID NOT RECEIVE ADEQUATE OR

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:12.346
TIMELY PRENATAL CARE WHICH COULD

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:14.147
HAVE PREVENTED TRANSMISSION.

01:44:14.214 --> 01:44:15.515
THE MOST COMMON MATERNAL RISK

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:17.317
FACTORS WERE SUBSTANCE USE

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:19.753
HOMELESSNESS EXCHANGE OF SEX FOR

01:44:19.820 --> 01:44:21.555
MONEY OR DRUGS AND CONTACT WITH

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.023
THE JAIL SYSTEM.

01:44:23.090 --> 01:44:24.891
STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM AT FIRST

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:27.227
BLUSH FATAL UNKNOWN NONFATAL

01:44:27.294 --> 01:44:28.595
OPIOID DOSES SUICIDE AND

01:44:28.662 --> 01:44:30.297
SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:31.932
SHARE MANY OF THE SAME ROOT

01:44:31.999 --> 01:44:33.133
CAUSES.

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.568
AND THEY ARE INCREASING DESPITE

01:44:34.635 --> 01:44:35.902
OUR PROGRESS IN HAVING ME

01:44:35.969 --> 01:44:37.504
EXPANDING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:38.839
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:44:38.905 --> 01:44:39.840
AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:40.574
BECAUSE THESE AREN'T JUST

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.009
DISEASES OF PEOPLE BUT THERE

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:43.644
DISEASES OF COMMUNITIES AND

01:44:43.710 --> 01:44:44.745
SOCIETY.

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:45.946
AND THERE ARE RISING IN A TIME

01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:46.680
WHEN INCREASING NUMBERS OF

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.982
PEOPLE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE

01:44:49.049 --> 01:44:50.450
RESOURCES TO AFFORD THE BASIC

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.819
COST OF LIVING LIKE HEALTHY.

01:44:52.886 --> 01:44:54.187
FOOD AND STABLE HOUSING.

01:44:54.254 --> 01:44:55.522
HOPELESSNESS AND DESPAIR ARE

01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:58.592
COMMON SYMPTOMS ACROSS EACH OF

01:44:58.659 --> 01:44:59.993
THESE CONDITIONS.

01:45:00.060 --> 01:45:01.194
AND THEY ARE ALSO RISE THEY HAVE

01:45:01.261 --> 01:45:02.095
ALSO HAVE THE WRITTEN ADVERSE

01:45:02.162 --> 01:45:04.398
EXPERIENCES IN CHILDHOOD SUCH AS

01:45:04.464 --> 01:45:07.134
POVERTY VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.569
AND STICK MY REMAINS A POWERFUL

01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:11.872
BERRIER TO SEEKING CARE.

01:45:11.938 --> 01:45:13.407
THESE CONDITIONS ALSO REFLECT AN

01:45:13.473 --> 01:45:14.641
INCREASING RELIANCE ON

01:45:14.708 --> 01:45:15.942
HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THAT'S IT

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:17.511
ALONE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:18.578
BECAUSE IT CAN ONLY TREAT THE

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.781
SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSES.

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.649
TO ALTERNATELY FOR US TO ADDRESS

01:45:22.716 --> 01:45:24.117
THESE AND OTHER DISEASES OF

01:45:24.184 --> 01:45:26.053
DESPAIR WE WILL NEED TO HAVE A

01:45:26.119 --> 01:45:27.454
SYSTEM OF PREVENTION THAT

01:45:27.521 --> 01:45:28.288
ADDRESSES.

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.823
THOSE REAP ROOT CAUSES LIKE

01:45:29.890 --> 01:45:31.258
POVERTY HOMELESSNESS AND

01:45:31.324 --> 01:45:33.560
VIOLENCE AND A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.395
THAT CAN PROVIDE TREATMENT FREE

01:45:35.462 --> 01:45:37.230
OF BIAS AND STIGMA AND THAT

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:38.465
RECOGNIZES THE MENTAL AND

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:40.500
EMOTIONAL HEALTH ARE AS INTEGRAL

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:42.569
TO THE PERSON'S WELL BEING AS

01:45:42.636 --> 01:45:43.704
PHYSICAL HEALTH.

01:45:43.770 --> 01:45:45.072
MAKING SIGNIFICANT STATE

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:46.406
SUSTAINABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.474
PUBLIC'S HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:45:47.541 --> 01:45:49.042
GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WE HAVE A

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:50.577
MUCH GREATER UNDERSTANDING.

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:52.279
HOW THESE SOCIAL PHYSICAL AND

01:45:52.345 --> 01:45:54.781
BEHAVIORAL FACTORS INTERACT?

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:55.649
AND FIGURING OUT WHICH LEVERS WE

01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:59.753
CAN USE EFFECTIVELY TO ACHIEVE

01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:00.921
AND MAINTAIN A HEALTHY AND

01:46:00.987 --> 01:46:02.856
RESILIENT CALIFORNIA.

01:46:02.923 --> 01:46:03.490
THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:05.225
QUESTIONS

01:46:05.292 --> 01:46:06.226
THANK YOU.

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:08.628
QUESTIONS BE MEMBERS THURSTONE

01:46:08.695 --> 01:46:11.331
WHILE ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR

01:46:11.398 --> 01:46:12.299
PRESENTATION THAT WAS --

01:46:12.365 --> 01:46:13.233
QUITE A QUITE AN EDUCATION FOR

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:17.604
ME AND WE CERTAINLY SEEN --

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.506
IN MY COUNTY RIVERSIDE COUNTY

01:46:19.573 --> 01:46:22.209
WE'VE SEEN A SURGE OF OF

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:25.879
SYPHILIS AND GONORRHEA SO I I

01:46:25.946 --> 01:46:27.080
JUST.

01:46:27.147 --> 01:46:29.015
WE NEED TO OBVIOUSLY GET OUT

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.851
INTO THE COMMUNITY AND TO HEDGE

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:33.487
KATE -- OUR

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.722
POPULATION THAT THE OF THE USER.

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:38.024
TREATABLE DISEASES THEY CAN BE

01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:39.559
PREVENTED WITH APPROPRIATE --

01:46:39.626 --> 01:46:41.061
PROTECTIONS --

01:46:41.128 --> 01:46:42.529
INSERTED THE CONGENITAL

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:45.832
SURPLUSES IS A MAJOR.

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:48.201
ISSUE FOR US TO DEAL WITH.

01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:49.636
I ALSO --

01:46:49.703 --> 01:46:51.171
SHARE YOUR CONCERN ABOUT

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:52.506
CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN THE IN THE

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:55.675
HIGHER INCIDENCE OF OF DIABETES

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:57.043
THAT WERE SAYING.

01:46:57.110 --> 01:46:59.546
IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT TODAY WE

01:46:59.613 --> 01:47:02.048
DON'T SEE THE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS

01:47:02.115 --> 01:47:03.917
THAT WE DID WHEN I WAS A KID YOU

01:47:03.984 --> 01:47:07.187
KNOW TODAY KIDS ARE YOU KNOW.

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:09.055
PROPERTY BUT MAY BE A LOT OF

01:47:09.122 --> 01:47:10.357
JUNK FOODS WHICH I DO AND

01:47:10.423 --> 01:47:11.792
SHOULDN'T --

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:13.393
BUT YOU KNOW WE USED TO BURN IT

01:47:13.460 --> 01:47:15.095
OFF YOU KNOW WE STEP P. PHYSICAL

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:16.196
EDUCATION CLASS AND WE USED TO

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:17.531
HAVE.

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:19.833
INTRAMURAL SPORTS AND WE USED.

01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:23.236
TO PLAY IN.

01:47:23.303 --> 01:47:24.504
WE GOT HOME AFTER DINNER WE WERE

01:47:24.571 --> 01:47:25.572
TO GO TO THAT WE'RE TIRED AFTER

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.908
ALL THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WE

01:47:27.974 --> 01:47:29.409
NEED SOMEHOW ANOTHER STRUCTURED

01:47:29.476 --> 01:47:30.677
YOUR YOUR YOUR PERVIOUS.

01:47:30.744 --> 01:47:31.978
WE NEED TO SOMEHOW ENCOURAGE

01:47:32.045 --> 01:47:35.682
MORE --

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:36.950
CARDIOVASCULAR.

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:38.185
STIMULATION WITHIN OUR SCHOOL

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:39.786
SYSTEM IN AND BRING BACK --

01:47:39.853 --> 01:47:41.488
MORE ACTIVE RECREATION AND

01:47:41.555 --> 01:47:42.856
SPORTS --

01:47:42.923 --> 01:47:44.257
AND I KNOW MANY IS ALWAYS AN

01:47:44.324 --> 01:47:46.293
ISSUE BUT YEAH WE JUST AND HAVE

01:47:46.359 --> 01:47:47.627
A CHILDHOOD OBESITY PROBLEMS

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:48.295
THAT WE DID.

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:49.863
WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND CERTAINLY

01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:51.464
THE COMPUTER GENERATION IN THE

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:52.833
ONLINE GAMING IS ARE ALSO PLAYED

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:54.968
A ROLE IN THE THAT THE STATIC

01:47:55.035 --> 01:47:56.870
ACTIVITY OF OF PEOPLE --

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:58.405
ANOTHER ISSUE PRODUCT THAT --

01:47:58.471 --> 01:48:00.373
IS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME IS

01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:02.008
THE THE SUICIDE RATE TO AND

01:48:02.075 --> 01:48:04.477
YOUNG CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS.

01:48:04.544 --> 01:48:06.079
AND THAT YOU ALSO BROUGHT UP --

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.315
ON AN ALARMING STATISTIC TO WITH

01:48:08.381 --> 01:48:11.918
THE THE NUMBER PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N&lt;/c&gt;

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:13.186
OVERDOSES OVERSEEING ANDIN THE

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:16.256
IN THE COMMUNITIES WHERE --

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:18.124
MAYBE SOMEBODY'S ARE CLASSIFIED

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:19.626
A SUICIDES BUT MANY OF THEM ARE

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.561
JUST MISTAKENLY INTERACTING WITH

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:23.029
A THINK IT'S HER WHEN AND IT IS

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:23.964
FOUNTAIN ALL.

01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.764
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF A

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:26.566
PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM WE CAN

01:48:26.633 --> 01:48:27.834
HAVE TO THOSE THAT ARE

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:29.569
UNFORTUNATELY CAUGHT UP IN THIS

01:48:29.636 --> 01:48:30.637
WILL BE A CRISIS.

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:31.838
THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.874
THAT YOU KNOW BE WHERE WHICH ARE

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:35.075
INJECTING MEANING MAYBE MUCH

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:36.076
STRONGER THAN WHAT YOU THINK

01:48:36.142 --> 01:48:37.477
YOU'RE INJECTING AND COULD CLAIM

01:48:37.544 --> 01:48:38.979
YOUR LIFE AND WE JUST HAD A

01:48:39.045 --> 01:48:41.414
FAMILY MEMBER --

01:48:41.481 --> 01:48:42.949
MY SON WHO'S ONE OF HIS

01:48:43.016 --> 01:48:44.417
CORPORATE FRIENDS CAME FROM.

01:48:44.484 --> 01:48:46.086
YOU KNOW A VERY VERY GOOD

01:48:46.152 --> 01:48:50.223
BEGINNINGS AND WENT TO SCHOOL.

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:53.827
GOT CAUGHT UP INTOXICATION SO

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.862
WAS VERY VERY DISTURBING.

01:48:55.929 --> 01:48:59.099
SO -- ALSO --

01:48:59.165 --> 01:49:00.600
IMAGINE A 50% OF THE DEATHS AND

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:02.903
CITY CALIFORNIA ARE DUE --

01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:03.770
TO CARDIAC --

01:49:03.837 --> 01:49:06.439
ISSUES AND AND CANCER ISSUES.

01:49:06.506 --> 01:49:09.542
A CERTAINLY --

01:49:09.609 --> 01:49:11.745
WE CAN EFFECTUATE --

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:14.814
YOU KNOW MUCH MORE --

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.449
HEALTHY LIVING --

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:17.717
WHICH WILL HELP A LOT NOT ONLY

01:49:17.784 --> 01:49:18.718
WITH THE DIABETES THAT WE

01:49:18.785 --> 01:49:19.953
MENTIONED BEFORE BUT ALSO

01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:21.788
PREVENT HEART DISEASE BY BREAK --

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:23.657
TO MODERN BUT PRESSURES.

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:27.127
BECAUSE A PROMISE KEEPER SO BUSY

01:49:27.193 --> 01:49:27.661
WITH OUR LIVES HELL TO GET

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:30.797
DIAGNOSED WITH NEXT THING YOU

01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:31.932
KNOW THE THIRD HOUSE BUT WITH A

01:49:31.998 --> 01:49:33.199
STROKE OR A HEART ATTACK AT A

01:49:33.266 --> 01:49:34.634
VERY YOUNG AGE IN AMERICA NO

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:35.635
LEAD A VERY.

01:49:35.702 --> 01:49:37.337
CHALLENGING LIFE --

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:38.238
AS WE KNOW THAT HEART MUSCLE

01:49:38.305 --> 01:49:38.939
DOESN'T --

01:49:39.005 --> 01:49:39.973
REALLY WE TO REGENERATE VERY

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:44.477
MUCH AFTER ITS DAMAGE SO --

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:45.545
I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.414
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW WE CAN

01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:48.415
MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES

01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:50.650
OF OF PEOPLE THAT.

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:52.519
ARE --

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:53.820
SUCCUMBING TO SOME OF THESE

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:55.255
ISSUES YOU KNOW AGAIN CHILD

01:49:55.322 --> 01:49:57.223
SUICIDE TO CANCER --

01:49:57.290 --> 01:49:58.591
WE CAN'T DO A WHOLE LOT ABOUT

01:49:58.658 --> 01:50:00.193
OTHER THAN TO PROMOTE YOU KNOW

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:01.561
SELF BREAST EXAM AND THINGS LIKE

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:02.495
THAT THAT ARE.

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:03.330
OF COURSE --

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.898
EMBRACED BY MANY NONPROFIT

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:07.267
ORGANIZATIONS BUT HOW DO WE GET

01:50:07.334 --> 01:50:08.368
TO THE COULD THE COMMUNICABLE

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:09.903
DISEASE PART I MEAN AT THE THE

01:50:09.970 --> 01:50:11.271
CONNERY AND A SURPLUS THAT IS

01:50:11.338 --> 01:50:12.706
JUST OFF THE CHARTS.

01:50:12.772 --> 01:50:15.241
IN MY COUNTY WHAT KIND OF A

01:50:15.308 --> 01:50:16.776
BETTER EDUCATION PROGRAM --

01:50:16.843 --> 01:50:18.144
DO WE NEED.

01:50:18.211 --> 01:50:20.013
TO MAYBE NOT REINVENT I MEAN IT

01:50:20.080 --> 01:50:20.780
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DID YOU

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:22.015
KNOW.

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:24.517
DECADES AGO BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT

01:50:24.584 --> 01:50:28.021
WAS THIS SEEMS TO BECOMING AN

01:50:28.088 --> 01:50:29.723
EPIDEMIC CAM IT IS AN EPIDEMIC

01:50:29.789 --> 01:50:30.890
THAT IT'S ACTUALLY VERY

01:50:30.957 --> 01:50:32.892
COMPLICATED AND IT WHICH IT'S

01:50:32.959 --> 01:50:33.927
GOING TO REQUIRE SEVERAL

01:50:33.994 --> 01:50:34.661
STRATEGIES.

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:38.565
THE SINGLE STRONGEST RISK FACTOR --

01:50:38.631 --> 01:50:39.799
FOR FOR EXAMPLE FOR SYPHILIS IS

01:50:39.866 --> 01:50:42.102
ACTUALLY METHAMPHETAMINE USE AND

01:50:42.168 --> 01:50:44.337
SO THERE'S A WE HAVE CINDA MAKES

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:45.438
GOING ON AS WE LIKE TO CALL TWO

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:46.973
EPIDEMICS OF TWO DIFFERENT

01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.441
THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY OR MORE

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.843
THAN TWO IN THIS CASE.

01:50:49.909 --> 01:50:51.911
THAT ARE PERPETUATING EACH OTHER

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:52.645
AND SAY --

01:50:52.712 --> 01:50:54.414
IT IN THERE AT THE SAME TIME

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:55.882
THERE ARE BARE AND WE'LL JUST

01:50:55.949 --> 01:50:56.816
STICK WITH WOMEN WITH SYPHILIS

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:57.884
JUST IT THERE IT'S SLIGHTLY

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.285
DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHICH

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:01.321
POPULATION BUT FOR EXAMPLE --

01:51:01.388 --> 01:51:03.323
WOMEN WHO DO USE SUBSTANCES

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:05.291
METHAMPHETAMINE IN PARTICULAR IS

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.227
VERY COMMON IT REALLY REMOVES

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:09.429
INHIBITIONS WOMEN MAY --

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:12.499
USE SEX TO FOR PROVIDE HOUSING

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.968
TO BRIBE FOOD ETCETERA SAFETY

01:51:15.035 --> 01:51:18.104
AND SO AT THE SAME TIME THERE

01:51:18.171 --> 01:51:19.139
ARE --

01:51:19.205 --> 01:51:21.174
BARRIERS TO SEEKING CARE AND IN

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:22.442
PARTICULAR SEEKING --

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:23.910
PRENATAL CARE --

01:51:23.977 --> 01:51:25.512
THERE ARE MANY WOMEN WHO TOLD US

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.280
THAT THEY DON'T GO IN TO SEE THE

01:51:27.347 --> 01:51:28.581
DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF

01:51:28.648 --> 01:51:30.016
CHILD WELFARE SERVICES AND YOU

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.551
KNOW SO THERE'S A THERE'S A WE

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:32.919
NEED TO KIND OF THINK VERY

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:35.555
CAREFULLY ABOUT OUR APPROACH --

01:51:35.622 --> 01:51:36.990
TO THESE WOMEN IN ORDER TO GET

01:51:37.057 --> 01:51:38.458
THEM INTO CARE THAT IS SUPPORTED

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:39.392
SO THAT THEY CAN GET THE

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:41.261
TREATMENT WHAT'S SO FRUSTRATING

01:51:41.327 --> 01:51:42.595
ABOUT THESE IS THAT THEY ARE

01:51:42.662 --> 01:51:44.030
PREVENTABLE.

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:45.231
AND THEN OF YOU KNOW FINDING

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:49.536
OPPORTUNITY ONE OF THE OTHER --

01:51:49.602 --> 01:51:51.971
REALLY SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS

01:51:52.038 --> 01:51:53.339
THEY PROVIDE CONDOMS THEY DO A

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:55.008
LOT OF INTERVENTION WITH FOLKS

01:51:55.075 --> 01:51:57.710
WHERE THEY'RE OUT AND EXPLAINING

01:51:57.777 --> 01:51:58.878
THE SITUATION TO THEM TOO SO.

01:51:58.945 --> 01:52:00.513
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS GOING

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.816
ON AND WE'RE WE'RE MODESTLY

01:52:02.882 --> 01:52:05.218
OPTIMISTIC BUT AT HEART.

01:52:05.285 --> 01:52:06.553
WE REALLY DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.188
HOMELESSNESS SINCE THE SUBSTANCE

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:09.722
USE THAT THAT INCREASES

01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:11.858
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE SOCIAL

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:13.460
ISSUES ARE SO TIGHTLY TIED UP

01:52:13.526 --> 01:52:14.928
WITH THESE --

01:52:14.994 --> 01:52:16.396
THESE PHYSICAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:52:16.463 --> 01:52:19.466
THAT IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT --

01:52:19.532 --> 01:52:21.034
TO NOT ADDRESS THEM AT THE SAME

01:52:21.101 --> 01:52:22.869
TIME AND BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:52:22.936 --> 01:52:24.437
WELL YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT --

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:26.139
YOU KNOW A WOMAN THE GOES IN

01:52:26.206 --> 01:52:28.074
THAT TO BE TREATED AND WITH

01:52:28.141 --> 01:52:29.142
METHAMPHETAMINE --

01:52:29.209 --> 01:52:33.746
ISSUES SYPHILIS.

01:52:33.813 --> 01:52:35.014
SHE'S AND SHE'S AFRAID ALL MY

01:52:35.081 --> 01:52:35.982
GOSH I'M GOING THERE NO ONE OF

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:37.617
MY KIDS TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE THEY

01:52:37.684 --> 01:52:38.618
SEE ME HAVING SOME.

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:41.788
RISKY LIFESTYLE ISSUES WITH --

01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:43.656
AYE AYE WHICH WAS A WAY WE CAN.

01:52:43.723 --> 01:52:44.624
HE'S THAT CONCERNED I DON'T KNOW

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:45.892
HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT

01:52:45.959 --> 01:52:47.460
BECAUSE CERTAIN MANDATED LAWS

01:52:47.527 --> 01:52:48.862
THAT YOU HAVE TO REPORT CERTAIN

01:52:48.928 --> 01:52:49.596
THINGS.

PARMA SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO WE

01:53:48.721 --> 01:53:51.591

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:52.559
FOUR WE'RE LOOKING A LOT OF THE

01:53:52.625 --> 01:53:54.327
DIFFERENT SERVICES THE STATE

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:55.995
PROVIDES THAT ALSO IMPACT SOCIAL

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:57.397
TERM ITSELF NOW THERE'S A IT'S A

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:58.631
TWO CATION ENVIRONMENT SO FORTH

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:00.066
THAT MIKE GUY COLLEAGUES ARE

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:01.801
ALSO THERE ARE ALSO IMPORTANT

01:54:01.868 --> 01:54:05.805
ELEMENTS --

01:54:05.872 --> 01:54:06.372
YEAH WELL IT'S GREAT TO HEAR

01:54:06.439 --> 01:54:09.409
THAT WERE ISSUE OF OF A BEING

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:11.077
HAS CONTINUED CONCERN IS

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:12.345
SOCIALLY SISTERS EVIDENCE

01:54:12.412 --> 01:54:13.813
SHOWING THAT IT CAN BECOME A

01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:15.114
GATEWAY.

01:54:15.181 --> 01:54:16.516
TO SMOKING --

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:17.517
SO THERE'S BEEN SOME DEBATE

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:18.484
ABOUT.

01:54:18.551 --> 01:54:20.253
THE BEING SEE FOR NOT SMOKING

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.721
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH THE

01:54:21.788 --> 01:54:23.556
SPECIALLY WITH USE WHO MAY BE

01:54:23.623 --> 01:54:25.425
INTRODUCED --

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:27.193
TO NICOTINE BY BEATING THAT THE

01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:28.895
MORE LIKELY TO PROGRESS AND TO

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:31.197
SMOKING ITSELF SO WHATEVER

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:32.232
COMMENTS TO MAKE ABOUT HOUSE A

01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:34.000
FEEDING ITSELF IS IN SOME OF THE

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.802
BACK AND FORTH ON THAT --

01:54:35.868 --> 01:54:38.404
AND THEN ACTUALLY ALSO EXPOSURE

01:54:38.471 --> 01:54:39.706
TO MARIJUANA A THAT YOU KNOW THE

01:54:39.772 --> 01:54:41.975
VOTERS SPOKE THERE WAS THE EAGLE

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:43.076
REGULATE FOR ADULTS.

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:44.577
BUT ALSO THERE'S BEEN

01:54:44.644 --> 01:54:46.045
INDICATIONS THAT THE SAME BABY

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.380
DEVICES I INTRODUCED PEOPLE TH

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:49.249
TOBACCO CAN ALSO INTRODUCE THEM

01:54:49.315 --> 01:54:49.882
TO CANCEL ITS.

01:54:49.949 --> 01:54:51.818
AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON THAT

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:52.452
WASN'T --

01:54:52.518 --> 01:54:54.854
BRAINS AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:56.289
WE'LL HAVE TO TO TO MODERN NOW

01:54:56.356 --> 01:54:57.857
TALKING ABOUT SUBSTANCE USE

01:54:57.924 --> 01:54:59.158
ACTUALLY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.126
HEARING OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE

01:55:00.193 --> 01:55:01.361
SELF ALL THE SUBCOMMITTEE

01:55:01.427 --> 01:55:02.795
MEMBERS --

01:55:02.862 --> 01:55:05.465
AND ACTUALLY SIR STONE IS MY NOT

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:10.670
ONLY MY WING MAN HERE AND THIS --

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:11.237
SUBCOMMITTEE BUT ALSO ON THE

01:55:11.304 --> 01:55:13.840
HEALTH COMMITTEE ACCESS TO

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:14.941
TREATMENT BECAUSE AS WAS

01:55:15.008 --> 01:55:16.743
MENTIONED THAT.

01:55:16.809 --> 01:55:17.944
YES THERE WAS A ROLL HEALTH

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:18.945
PROFESSIONALS PLAYED IN TERMS OF

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:20.079
OF BIRTH POTENTIALLY OVER

01:55:20.146 --> 01:55:21.848
PRESCRIBING --

01:55:21.914 --> 01:55:24.684
OPIATES AND BUT IT'S NOW SHIFTED

01:55:24.751 --> 01:55:26.386
MORE TO A THE LIST USE AND AND

01:55:26.452 --> 01:55:27.720
FRANKLY.

01:55:27.787 --> 01:55:29.522
WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS AS AS MUCH

01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:30.423
AS FOR SO OF COURSE YOU WANT

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:32.191
FEWER PEOPLE TO TAKE BECOME

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:34.494
ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS AND TO TO

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.396
ENTER THAT PIPELINE --

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.264
BUT WE ALSO CAN'T A BAND THAT

01:55:38.331 --> 01:55:39.165
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FORTY ALREADY

01:55:39.232 --> 01:55:40.867
THERE AND SO TO BE SURE THAT

01:55:40.933 --> 01:55:42.068
HAVE GREATER ACCESS TO TREATMENT

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:43.503
AND WHAT ARE WE DOING IN THAT

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:44.871
REGARD SO WHY THAT'S ONLY GOING

01:55:44.937 --> 01:55:46.172
TO BE A SOMETHING THAT THE

01:55:46.239 --> 01:55:47.907
LEGISLATURE IS AS LOOKING TO

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:50.043
ADDRESS AND IN.

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:52.078
THAT ISSUE AND THEN --

01:55:52.145 --> 01:55:53.746
STDS WERE ACTUALLY HAVING A

01:55:53.813 --> 01:55:54.847
HEARING NEXT WEEK --

01:55:54.914 --> 01:55:56.149
THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ON THAT OUR

01:55:56.215 --> 01:55:57.517
PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:55:57.583 --> 01:55:58.818
AND I WOULD MAKE NO EVEN THOUGH

01:55:58.885 --> 01:56:00.753
WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH IT TODAY

01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.288
BUT I THINK THE LAST BUDGET

01:56:02.355 --> 01:56:03.856
SUBCOMMITTEE I DID CHALLENGE --

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.191
YOUR DEPARTMENT TO TELL IT TO

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:06.559
COME BACK TO SAY WHAT KIND OF

01:56:06.626 --> 01:56:08.361
RESOURCES NECESSARY TO REBUILD

01:56:08.428 --> 01:56:10.697
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE

01:56:10.763 --> 01:56:11.531
IN MANY WAYS.

01:56:11.597 --> 01:56:15.034
OUR IN OUR STATE AND COUNTIES

01:56:15.101 --> 01:56:18.771
MADE BE SURE TO PROTECTS THAT

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.473
DIRECT SERVICES FOR MANY PEOPLE

01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:22.175
AT GREAT NEEDS --

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:24.110
BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY I THINK

01:56:24.177 --> 01:56:26.112
RESTORED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE YET

01:56:26.179 --> 01:56:27.413
AND THAT'S TO INFRASTRUCTURE

01:56:27.480 --> 01:56:28.214
THAT'S NOT ONLY DEALING WITH

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:29.849
SOME OF THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS

01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:30.683
BUT ALSO WITH --

01:56:30.750 --> 01:56:31.784
EMERGING --

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:34.253
DISEASES AS WELL AND WE TALK

01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:35.888
ABOUT STDS.

01:56:35.955 --> 01:56:37.824
I MEAN THEY'RE NOT.

01:56:37.890 --> 01:56:38.591
BUT THE CELTIC ANY OF THEM ARE

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:40.293
NEW EMERGING DISEASES AT THE

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.028
MOMENT OR MULTI DRUG RESISTANT

01:56:42.095 --> 01:56:43.763
GONORRHEA THAT'S TRUE MULTI DRUG

01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:44.897
RESISTANT GOT AND NOT JUST THE

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.632
STANDARD GONORRHEA ANYMORE --

01:56:46.699 --> 01:56:48.801
SO YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO GET WE

01:56:48.868 --> 01:56:50.203
NEED TO BE SURE WE GET THAT

01:56:50.269 --> 01:56:52.338
INFRASTRUCTURE UP AND DEATH AND

01:56:52.405 --> 01:56:53.106
SO CLEARLY --

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:54.607
THAT --

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:55.475
FATHER CERTAINLY MANY SOCIAL

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:56.743
DETERMINES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:59.912
THE THE CLIENT AT INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:01.447
IS SOMETHING THAT --

01:57:01.514 --> 01:57:03.950
CERTAINLY IS LEADING --

01:57:04.016 --> 01:57:05.685
TO THIS GROWTH AND STDS.

01:57:05.752 --> 01:57:06.786
THINKING ABOUT SURPLUS AND WE

01:57:06.853 --> 01:57:08.087
THOUGHT WE BEAT THAT BACK IN THE

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:09.622
VICTORIAN ERA I KNOW THAT THAT'S

01:57:09.689 --> 01:57:11.257
WHEN IT STOPPED ONLY FINALLY THE

01:57:11.324 --> 01:57:12.792
PENICILLIN FROM THE EVENT HAS

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:13.693
SOMEONE THAT REALLY KILLED THOSE

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.027
BILLS PARAKEETS AND I THOUGHT WE

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:20.767
WERE DONE WITH THAT BUT

01:57:20.833 --> 01:57:23.035
UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE THAT'S BACK.

01:57:23.102 --> 01:57:24.404
LIKELY EVEN ACCESS TO

01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:25.505
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE WORD

01:57:25.571 --> 01:57:26.973
THOSE THINGS AND GET CAUGHT SO

01:57:27.039 --> 01:57:29.108
AS THERE'S THIS DEBATE ABOUT

01:57:29.175 --> 01:57:30.710
REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH ACCESS.

01:57:30.777 --> 01:57:31.911
THAT DOES HAVE IMPLICATIONS A

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.179
SOMEONE IS ACTUALLY SPENT

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.881
SOMETIME WORKING AT STD CLINIC

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:37.817
AND AND TRIUMPH AND THEN --

01:57:37.884 --> 01:57:38.418
THEY'LL INVOLVED WITH OKAY

01:57:38.484 --> 01:57:39.352
CONTACT TRACING AND ALL THIS

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.553
OTHER ACTIVITIES PUBLIC HEALTH

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:41.754
ACTIVITIES.

01:57:41.821 --> 01:57:45.024
THAT TAKE PLACE --

01:57:45.091 --> 01:57:46.592
HILL SUICIDE MENTAL HEALTH AGAIN --

01:57:46.659 --> 01:57:47.827
SOMETHING THAT --

01:57:47.894 --> 01:57:48.928
WE'RE ALSO --

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:50.363
WE'RE HAVING ACTUALLY JUST HAD

01:57:50.430 --> 01:57:51.731
AN OVERSIGHT HEARING ABOUT THAT

01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:53.366
LAST WEEK WE'RE DOING PART TWO

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:54.834
NEXT WEEK SO --

01:57:54.901 --> 01:57:55.802
THEIR JOINT HEALTH COMMITTEES

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:56.969
INCLUDE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY

01:57:57.036 --> 01:57:58.471
HEALTH COMMITTEE SO AGAIN

01:57:58.538 --> 01:57:59.572
LOOKING AT THESE --

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.007
THESE ISSUES --

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.842
AND ALSO HOW TO IMPROVE ACCESS

01:58:02.909 --> 01:58:04.377
TO MENTAL HEALTH FOR FOR YOUNG

01:58:04.444 --> 01:58:05.178
PEOPLE BUT OF COURSE --

01:58:05.244 --> 01:58:07.547
SITES NOT JUST YOUNG PEOPLE --

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:09.015
BUT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM I ALSO

01:58:09.081 --> 01:58:11.417
MAKE NOTE THAT YOU MENTIONED 46%

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:14.086
OF CALIFORNIANS ARE PRE DIABETIC.

01:58:14.153 --> 01:58:16.222
I I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:19.058
WHEN YOU'RE QUOTING SOME YEAH I

01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:20.626
A SAID WHAT WE HAVE THE NUMBERS

01:58:20.693 --> 01:58:22.328
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GET TO

01:58:22.395 --> 01:58:23.896
KNOW I I GOT IT BUT YEAH YEAH

01:58:23.963 --> 01:58:25.932
BUT I SAW A BIG NOTE FOR EXAMPLE --

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.533
THE SCREENING FOR ATI IT

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:30.169
ACTUALLY IT IS AT A LOW RUBIO BY.

01:58:30.236 --> 01:58:31.671
THAN IT IS FOR THE GENERAL

01:58:31.737 --> 01:58:34.173
POPULATION BECAUSE WE TEND TO

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:36.976
HIGH WE TEND TO HIGHER FAT

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:39.645
BETTER I GUESS.

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:40.646
AND SO BUT THE PEOPLE NEED TO

01:58:40.713 --> 01:58:41.647
KNOW THAT RIGHT SO SOMETIMES

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:42.582
THAT GETS UNDERESTIMATE BECAUSE

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.884
CLINICIANS ARE USING DIFFERENT

01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:46.853
BMI A LOWER BMI FOR THE API

01:58:46.919 --> 01:58:47.753
COMMUNITY --

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.722
BUT AS YOU MENTIONED ONE FOURTH

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.257
OF THESE PRE DIABETICS WE DON'T

01:58:51.324 --> 01:58:52.492
DO ANYTHING WILL ADVANCE THE

01:58:52.558 --> 01:58:54.760
DIABETES AND THAT'S TREMENDOUS

01:58:54.827 --> 01:58:55.928
WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET THAT THE

01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:57.363
PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES AMERICA

01:58:57.430 --> 01:58:57.897
I MEAN THAT'S A TREMENDOUS

01:58:57.964 --> 01:58:58.931
FUTURE COST.

01:58:58.998 --> 01:59:01.033
AND IN FACT LAST YEAR I THINK

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:03.369
WAS LAST YEAR WE STARTED PUSHING

01:59:03.436 --> 01:59:05.137
FOR THE PILOT FUNDINGBUT I

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.072
THINK WE NEED TO THINK MORE

01:59:06.138 --> 01:59:08.040
BROADLY ABOUT THE BRING IT TO

01:59:08.107 --> 01:59:09.108
SCALE.

01:59:09.175 --> 01:59:10.576
IT READ JUST LIKE THE DIABETES

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:12.378
PREVENTION PROGRAMS --

01:59:12.445 --> 01:59:12.979
THAT'S AN INTERVENTION THAT'S

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:15.248
BEEN VERY WELL EVALUATED SO IT'S

01:59:15.314 --> 01:59:16.015
NOT JUST LIKE I THINK THIS IS

01:59:16.082 --> 01:59:17.316
GOING TO HELP IT'S BEEN

01:59:17.383 --> 01:59:19.485
EVALUATED UP YEAH YO RANDOMIZED

01:59:19.552 --> 01:59:20.586
CONTROL STUDIES.

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:23.256
SHOWS REDUCE THE MOVEMENT FROM

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:25.091
PRE DAVIES DIABETES ABOUT ALMOST

01:59:25.157 --> 01:59:28.261
BY HALF ABOUT FORTY A THINK 47%

01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:32.698
IS FOR SIX OBSERVERS THAT.

01:59:32.765 --> 01:59:33.966
VERY SUCCESSFUL.

01:59:34.033 --> 01:59:35.601
SO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT 46% A

01:59:35.668 --> 01:59:36.502
QUARTER THOSE WE DON'T DO

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:37.703
ANYTHING SO THAT'S NOW WE'RE

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:39.472
TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW 1112% OF

01:59:39.539 --> 01:59:40.239
THOSE PEOPLE BECOMING OF THE

01:59:40.306 --> 01:59:42.074
WHOLE POPULATION BEGIN DIABETIC.

01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:43.009
THE FACT THAT WE CAN CUT THAT

01:59:43.075 --> 01:59:44.744
FROM THAT TO MAYBE DOWN THE FIVE

01:59:44.810 --> 01:59:47.914
OR 6% YOU KNOW WITH WE DO THIS.

01:59:47.980 --> 01:59:49.815
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY TO SEE A

01:59:49.882 --> 01:59:50.816
LOT OF NIGHTS OUT BUT IT DOES

01:59:50.883 --> 01:59:52.318
REQUIRE SOME FUNNY UP FRONT SO

01:59:52.385 --> 01:59:53.719
WE REALLY DO NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:59:53.786 --> 01:59:55.121
THOSE KIND OF VESTMENTS AS WE'RE

01:59:55.187 --> 01:59:56.222

SAYING WHAT CAN WE DO.

01:59:59.825 --> 02:00:01.027

02:00:01.093 --> 02:00:03.930
MONEY IT'S THE LIFE DIABETES IS

02:00:03.996 --> 02:00:05.565

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:07.233
EYESIGHT ILLUSION LIMBS.

WILL GET THAT MONEY IN SOMETHING

02:00:33.826 --> 02:00:34.660
WHAT WE CAN EXPECT THE RESULT.

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:37.597

HER AT FORMAT THAT IT WAS AND

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.326
HOW IT HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE

02:02:47.393 --> 02:02:48.861
REALLY TROUBLING --

02:02:48.928 --> 02:02:49.528
ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING IN OUR

02:02:49.595 --> 02:02:51.263

HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND THERE

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:57.303
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF STRIDES MADE --

02:02:57.369 --> 02:02:59.071
IN TOBACCO FOR EXAMPLE BUT

02:02:59.138 --> 02:02:59.638
THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:00.639
FUNDING --

02:03:00.706 --> 02:03:02.608
PROVIDED FOR TOBACCO AND WE KNOW

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:03.743
YOU KNOW FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:03:03.809 --> 02:03:04.844
WHAT TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ARE

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.178
HELPFUL WE KNOW HOW DIFFERENT

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:07.246
STRATEGIES.

02:03:07.313 --> 02:03:08.214
AND TO ADDRESS THINGS LIKE

02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:09.782
CHRONIC DISEASES AND STDS AND SO

02:03:09.849 --> 02:03:11.617
FORTH BUT ALSO OFTEN AT THE

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:12.485
LOCAL LEVEL THE FUNDING IS

02:03:12.551 --> 02:03:13.919
REALLY CONSTRAINTS WE APPRECIATE

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:15.988
YOUR ATTENTION TO THAT --

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:17.323
AND THEN IN TERMS OF CHRONIC

02:03:17.389 --> 02:03:18.491
DISEASES I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT

02:03:18.557 --> 02:03:19.391
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A

02:03:19.458 --> 02:03:20.459
SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:21.761
FOR CHRONIC DISEASE IN OUR STATE.

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.395
AND SO OFTEN TIMES AT THE LOCAL

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:24.964
LEVEL ARE PIECING TOGETHER A LOT

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:26.332
OF THE GRANT FUNDING **** OR

02:03:26.398 --> 02:03:26.999
DIFFERENT POCKETS OF THE FEDERAL

02:03:27.066 --> 02:03:27.900
FUNDS -- BUT

02:03:27.967 --> 02:03:29.168
THERE'S NOT A COMPREHENSIVE

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.669
APPROACH TO THATAND WE MADE

02:03:30.736 --> 02:03:31.403
HUGE STRIDES ON THE HEALTHCARE

02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:32.538
SIDE -- BUT

02:03:32.605 --> 02:03:34.106
WE REALLY THINK THAT NOW IS THE

02:03:34.173 --> 02:03:35.474
TIME TO TO START FOCUSING ON

02:03:35.541 --> 02:03:36.942
PREVENTION AND HOW WE CAN AVOID

02:03:37.009 --> 02:03:40.346
SOME OF THE COSTS DOWN THE ROAD

02:03:40.412 --> 02:03:41.981
TO THIS.

02:03:42.047 --> 02:03:42.915
OKAY THANK YOU ANDI WOULD ALSO

02:03:42.982 --> 02:03:44.150
JUST MAKE NOTE HOW IMPORTANT ARE

02:03:44.216 --> 02:03:44.517
COUNTY --

02:03:44.583 --> 02:03:45.651
HEALTH OFFICERS AND COUNTY

02:03:45.718 --> 02:03:46.819
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE JUST NOT

02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:48.554
SOMETHING THAT IS JUST DONE AT

02:03:48.621 --> 02:03:50.156
THE STATE I MEAN WITHOUT THE

02:03:50.222 --> 02:03:51.423
COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.192
HEALTH OFFICERS SO WE WOULD NOT

02:03:53.259 --> 02:03:55.094
BE ABLE --

02:03:55.161 --> 02:03:57.630
TO MAKE ANY OF THIS HAPPEN I

02:03:57.696 --> 02:03:58.063
WOULD ALSO JUST --

02:03:58.130 --> 02:03:59.799
PERHAPS IF NEGLECTED TO MAKE

02:03:59.865 --> 02:04:02.301
NOTE I NOTICED HERE THAT --

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:04.170
SO CERTAINLY THE OPIOID CRISIS

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:06.906
IS A THAT IS AND WE NEED TO

02:04:06.972 --> 02:04:08.474
ADDRESS BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:09.809
MORE PEOPLE DIED LAST YEAR FROM

02:04:09.875 --> 02:04:11.844
INFLUENZA.

02:04:11.911 --> 02:04:13.712
THEN DIED OF OPIOID OVERDOSE

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:15.514
DOESN'T MEAN THAT OPIATE

02:04:15.581 --> 02:04:17.216
OVERDOSE IS ANY LESS IMPORTANT --

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:18.751
BUT WEEKS OR SOME VERY BASIC

02:04:18.818 --> 02:04:20.586
THINGS WE CAN DO LIKE IT PEOPLE

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:21.821
VACCINATED.

02:04:21.887 --> 02:04:24.490
AND SAVE LIVES SO --

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:25.925
DOWN OF A THINK ABOUT THE NUMBER

02:04:25.991 --> 02:04:26.659
PEOPLE DIED OF INFLUENZA LAST

02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:27.860
YEAR -- AND

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:29.361
OTHER TYPES OF DISEASES AND

02:04:29.428 --> 02:04:30.563
HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THEM A

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:32.798
DISTANT MEMORY SO WITH THAT --

02:04:32.865 --> 02:04:36.635
LET'S GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO

02:04:36.702 --> 02:04:37.603
ISSUES SO WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD

02:04:37.670 --> 02:04:39.839
AND GO THROUGH ISSUES TWO

02:04:39.905 --> 02:04:41.473
THROUGH THIRTEEN AND THEN WE'LL

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:44.176
TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS --%

02:04:44.243 --> 02:04:47.780
AFTER THAT ON ON THOSE.

DID IN THE EARLIER A PORTION OF

02:32:01.378 --> 02:32:02.046
THIS HEARING THAT --

02:32:02.112 --> 02:32:02.980
THERE ARE NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS

02:32:03.047 --> 02:32:04.348
THIS YEAR THAT ARE REQUESTING

02:32:04.415 --> 02:32:06.250
FULL FUNDING FOR A. T. PROJECTS

02:32:06.317 --> 02:32:07.785

BECAUSE THE DEPARTMENT DOES HOPE

02:32:15.192 --> 02:32:17.194
TO AWARD A CONTRACT VERY SOON.

02:32:17.261 --> 02:32:18.562
A IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING --

02:32:18.629 --> 02:32:22.132
M. BECAUSE BUILDING IT OFF OF

02:32:22.199 --> 02:32:23.767
THEIR EXISTING PLATFORM AND IT'S

02:32:23.834 --> 02:32:25.636
MORE OF LIKE AN OFF THE SHELF

02:32:25.703 --> 02:32:27.238
TYPE A SOLUTION --

02:32:27.304 --> 02:32:27.838
BUT WE DO HAVE A COUPLE

02:32:27.905 --> 02:32:30.341
SUGGESTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE

02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:31.675

02:32:31.742 --> 02:32:33.577
TO APPROVE SINGLE YEAR FUNDING

02:32:33.644 --> 02:32:35.279
SO THAT --

02:32:35.346 --> 02:32:37.348
THE THE THE LEGISLATURE CAN

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:38.849
CONTINUE TO RECEIVE UPDATES

02:32:38.916 --> 02:32:40.918
THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET CHANGE

02:32:40.985 --> 02:32:42.319
PROPOSAL PROCESS --

02:32:42.386 --> 02:32:44.388
SECOND -- IT

02:32:44.455 --> 02:32:45.823
MIGHT BE --

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:47.157
AS THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS ABOUT

02:32:47.224 --> 02:32:48.993
THE SPECIFIC COSTS THAT ARE

02:32:49.059 --> 02:32:50.895
PROPOSED BY BIDDERS --

02:32:50.961 --> 02:32:52.463
IT MIGHT BE WORTHWHILE TO HAVE

02:32:52.530 --> 02:32:54.031
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE AND

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:56.166

02:32:56.233 --> 02:32:57.935
ABOUT THE PRECISE COSTS --

02:32:58.002 --> 02:32:59.970
AND FINALLY IF THE DEPARTMENT

02:33:00.037 --> 02:33:02.606
DOES GET AN UPDATE ABOUT

02:33:02.673 --> 02:33:04.308

IT WOULD BE GREAT.

02:33:08.846 --> 02:33:10.147
TO GET AN UPDATE TO THE

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:11.382
PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:14.118

THINGS HAPPEN SOMETIMES THINGS

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:32.409
DOWN RIGHT AND SO AND THEN WE

02:42:32.476 --> 02:42:33.944
HAVE TO BE JUST WHAT WE DO SO

HAVING TO DEAL WITH RASCAL RIGHT

02:43:22.025 --> 02:43:23.393
NOW AND WOULD BE.

02:43:23.460 --> 02:43:25.562
WITH THE NEW IT SYSTEM WOULD WE

THE WEEK AGENDA THERE ARE THREE

02:47:13.757 --> 02:47:15.525
QUESTIONS SO FIRST ALL STAR WITH

02:47:15.592 --> 02:47:17.327
A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CHANGES

02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:19.963
IN THE WAKE PROGRAM ESTIMATE.

02:47:20.029 --> 02:47:21.231
CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION DO

02:47:21.297 --> 02:47:23.199
CONTINUE TO SEE A DECLINE IN

02:47:23.266 --> 02:47:24.667
PARTICIPATION IN THE WAKE

02:47:24.734 --> 02:47:25.502
PROGRAM.

02:47:25.568 --> 02:47:28.071
BUT WHAT WE SAW IN CALIFORNIA IN

02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:29.205
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE DECLINE

02:47:29.272 --> 02:47:30.740
WAS LESS THAN WHAT IT HAD BEEN.

02:47:30.807 --> 02:47:33.143
IN PREVIOUS YEARS WE CURRENTLY

02:47:33.209 --> 02:47:34.711
SERVE JUST UNDER ONE MILLION

02:47:34.778 --> 02:47:36.546
PARTICIPATION PARTICIPANTS EACH

02:47:36.613 --> 02:47:39.816
MONTH AND EXPECT TO SPEND SEVEN

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:40.350
HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION

02:47:40.417 --> 02:47:41.351
DOLLARS ON FOOD.

02:47:41.418 --> 02:47:43.686
IN THE BUDGET YEAR.

02:47:43.753 --> 02:47:44.921
ABOUT HALF THE BABY'S BORN IN

02:47:44.988 --> 02:47:46.489
CALIFORNIA EACH YEAR ARE

02:47:46.556 --> 02:47:48.525
ENROLLED IN THE WICK PROGRAM.

02:47:48.591 --> 02:47:49.826
AND THE ONLY PROGRAMMATIC CHANGE

02:47:49.893 --> 02:47:51.194
IN THE PAST YEAR IN IN THE

02:47:51.261 --> 02:47:54.564
ESTIMATE IS IN FALL OF TWENTY

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:56.332
EIGHTEEN U. S. T. A. DID --

02:47:56.399 --> 02:47:59.002
APPROVED A AN INCREASE TO THE

02:47:59.068 --> 02:48:00.537
DOLLAR OF THE FRUIT AND

02:48:00.603 --> 02:48:03.139
VEGETABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT DOLLARS

02:48:03.206 --> 02:48:04.607
A MONTH TO NINE DOLLARS A MONTH

02:48:04.674 --> 02:48:05.241
SO THAT WASN'T.

02:48:05.308 --> 02:48:06.776
A COST INCREASE IN THE PROGRAM

02:48:06.843 --> 02:48:08.144
THERE AND WE HAVE SUFFICIENT

02:48:08.211 --> 02:48:10.747
FUNDS TO COVER THAT.

02:48:10.814 --> 02:48:12.782
EACH YEAR USDA DOES PRODUCE A

02:48:12.849 --> 02:48:14.484
REPORT WHICH WE CALL THE PROGRAM

02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:16.219
REACH REPORT THEY ESTIMATE THE

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:17.287
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

02:48:17.353 --> 02:48:18.688
ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM AND

02:48:18.755 --> 02:48:20.723
COMPARE THAT TO THE NUMBERS OF

02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:22.225
PEOPLE THAT WERE ACTUALLY SERVED.

02:48:22.292 --> 02:48:24.160
AND PRODUCE A PERCENTAGE WHAT WE

02:48:24.227 --> 02:48:25.962
CALL OUR OUR PROGRAM REACHER

02:48:26.029 --> 02:48:27.096
COVERAGE RAE.

02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:28.565
AND THE LAST REPORT CAME OUT

02:48:28.631 --> 02:48:30.300
THIS MONTH OR EARLY THIS MONTH

02:48:30.366 --> 02:48:31.901
AND IT'S LOOKING AT TWENTY

02:48:31.968 --> 02:48:33.169
SIXTEEN DATA.

02:48:33.236 --> 02:48:35.171
WITHOUT REPORT CALIFORNIA

02:48:35.238 --> 02:48:37.941
SERVICE SIXTY FIVE POINT 6% OF

02:48:38.007 --> 02:48:39.776
THE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE -

02:48:39.843 --> 02:48:41.277
EXCUSE ME ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS

02:48:41.344 --> 02:48:43.746
IN CALIFORNIA IN.

02:48:43.813 --> 02:48:44.380
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THE NATIONAL

02:48:44.447 --> 02:48:47.283
AVERAGE IS 54% FOR THAT YEAR.

02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:49.285
AT THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR

02:48:49.352 --> 02:48:50.553
COVERAGE RATE FROM THE PRIOR

02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:52.322
YEAR WHERE WE ARE AT SIXTY FIVE

02:48:52.388 --> 02:48:54.257
POINT ZERO SO WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:55.225
SLIGHT INCREASE.

02:48:55.291 --> 02:48:56.693
OF ONE OF THE INTERESTING

02:48:56.759 --> 02:48:59.062
CHANGES IN THAT YEAR AND TWENTY

02:48:59.128 --> 02:49:00.230
SIXTEEN IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR

02:49:00.296 --> 02:49:01.798
FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL YEARS THAT

02:49:01.865 --> 02:49:03.166
THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:05.535
NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS.

02:49:05.602 --> 02:49:07.604
SO THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE

02:49:07.670 --> 02:49:09.038
NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:10.740
BUT THERE WAS A LARGER DECREASE

02:49:10.807 --> 02:49:11.774
IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE SAID

02:49:11.841 --> 02:49:13.610
WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT AND A

02:49:13.676 --> 02:49:15.879
NUMBER OF YEARS.

02:49:15.945 --> 02:49:17.347
SO WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF

02:49:17.413 --> 02:49:19.616
THINGS TO MAXIMIZE PARTICIPATION

02:49:19.682 --> 02:49:21.150
IN THE PROGRAM AND I'VE SHARED

02:49:21.217 --> 02:49:22.986
WITH THE COMMITTEE IN THE PAST

02:49:23.052 --> 02:49:24.053
OLD AS JUST TO HAVE A BRIEF

02:49:24.120 --> 02:49:25.588
OVERVIEW OF SOME THINGS THAT

02:49:25.655 --> 02:49:26.489
WE'RE DOING.

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:28.224
IN OUR FIRST AREA OF DATA AND

02:49:28.291 --> 02:49:30.460
RESEARCH WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:32.095
ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE A GOOD

02:49:32.161 --> 02:49:33.863
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CAL FRESH

02:49:33.930 --> 02:49:35.431
PROGRAM WHERE WE MATCH.

02:49:35.498 --> 02:49:37.934
WITH DATA WITH CAL FRESH DATA WE

02:49:38.001 --> 02:49:39.569
SELECT ONE MONTH EACH YEAR SO WE

02:49:39.636 --> 02:49:41.704
LOOK AT MARCH DATA ENROLLMENT

02:49:41.771 --> 02:49:43.172
DATA FOR BOTH PROGRAMS.

02:49:43.239 --> 02:49:44.274
THE FIRST YEAR WE DID IT WAS

02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:46.476
LOOKING AT TWENTY SIXTEEN DATA.

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:49.812
AND WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY

02:49:49.879 --> 02:49:51.214
VISUALS THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

02:49:51.281 --> 02:49:52.615
WORK BUT NOT IN WORK AND THEN

02:49:52.682 --> 02:49:53.883
VICE VERSA.

02:49:53.950 --> 02:49:55.184
AND THEN WE DID IT ALSO FOR

02:49:55.251 --> 02:49:57.053
MARCH OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND

02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.087
WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP FOR

02:49:58.154 --> 02:49:59.622
MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND

02:49:59.689 --> 02:50:00.523
HAVE SEEN SOME.

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:01.524
SOME INTERESTING THINGS WERE

02:50:01.591 --> 02:50:03.626
FAMILIES GOING FROM ONE PROGRAM

02:50:03.693 --> 02:50:04.861
TO ANOTHER OR THEY WERE IN BOTH

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:06.296
PROGRAMS ONE YEAR AND ONE

02:50:06.362 --> 02:50:08.097
PROGRAM THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN

02:50:08.164 --> 02:50:09.766
BOTH AGAIN AND SO.

02:50:09.832 --> 02:50:11.200
LOTS OF CHANGES HAPPENING THERE.

02:50:11.267 --> 02:50:13.169
WERE ALSO REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

02:50:13.236 --> 02:50:14.704
OUR MOST RECENT PARTNERSHIP WITH

02:50:14.771 --> 02:50:16.506
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM WHERE WE'RE

02:50:16.573 --> 02:50:18.007
ABLE TO DO THE SAME TYPE OF A

02:50:18.074 --> 02:50:19.409
MATCH WITH MEDICAL THIS IS THE

02:50:19.475 --> 02:50:20.910
FIRST TIME THAT WE'VE DONE THAT

02:50:20.977 --> 02:50:22.045
AND WE'RE JUST FINISHING UP THAT

02:50:22.111 --> 02:50:23.279
ANALYSIS.

02:50:23.346 --> 02:50:24.948
SO WITH BOTH OF THOSE TWO TWO

02:50:25.014 --> 02:50:26.849
TYPES OF ANALYSIS WE DO PROVIDE

02:50:26.916 --> 02:50:28.451
MAPS TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES THAT

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:30.086
IDENTIFY HOT SPOTS WHERE THERE

02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:30.853
ARE.

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:34.457
A NUMBER OF WEEK OF POTENTIAL

02:50:34.524 --> 02:50:35.258
ELIGIBLE --

02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:36.626
FOR INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE CAN

02:50:36.693 --> 02:50:38.227
TARGET OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS AND

02:50:38.294 --> 02:50:39.295
UNDERSTAND WHAT MIGHT BE

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:40.396
HAPPENING DIFFERENTLY IN

02:50:40.463 --> 02:50:43.566
DIFFERENT IN THOSE COMMUNITIES --

02:50:43.633 --> 02:50:44.901
ANOTHER BIG AREA THAT WE WORK ON

02:50:44.968 --> 02:50:46.102
IS --

02:50:46.169 --> 02:50:47.804
IMPROVING OUR PROGRAM SERVICES

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:49.639
SO BOTH LOOKING AT REDUCING

02:50:49.706 --> 02:50:51.007
BARRIERS.

02:50:51.074 --> 02:50:52.542
TWO AND ROLLING OR PARTICIPATING

02:50:52.609 --> 02:50:54.410
IN THE PROGRAM AND ALSO

02:50:54.477 --> 02:50:55.945
INCREASING.

02:50:56.012 --> 02:50:57.747
THE BENEFITS OR THE RELEVANCY OF

02:50:57.814 --> 02:50:59.148
THE PROGRAM THERE SO WE'VE

02:50:59.215 --> 02:51:01.784
IMPLEMENTED A NUMBER OF POLICIES.

02:51:01.851 --> 02:51:02.685
TO MAKE --

02:51:02.752 --> 02:51:04.454
ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM EASIER

02:51:04.520 --> 02:51:07.490
WERE ALSO WORKING WITH USDA TO

02:51:07.557 --> 02:51:08.458
APPROVE -- A

02:51:08.524 --> 02:51:10.360
COUPLE PILOTS ONE FOUR

02:51:10.426 --> 02:51:11.861
TELESERVICES FOR BREAST FEEDING

02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:13.062
SUPPORT.

02:51:13.129 --> 02:51:15.231
AND OTHER FOR RECERTIFY.

02:51:15.298 --> 02:51:18.267
PARTICIPANTS ONLINE RATHER THAN

02:51:18.334 --> 02:51:20.837
IN PERSON --

02:51:20.903 --> 02:51:21.804
AND THEN OF COURSE THE BIG

02:51:21.871 --> 02:51:23.039
CHANGE THAT WE'RE MAKING FOR THE

02:51:23.106 --> 02:51:24.340
BENEFITS IS IMPLEMENTING THE

02:51:24.407 --> 02:51:25.942
WHAT CARD SO WE'LL BE MOVING

02:51:26.009 --> 02:51:27.910
FROM PAPER VOUCHERS TO THE

02:51:27.977 --> 02:51:29.312
ELECTRONIC CARD.

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:31.314
WE GO LIVE WITH OUR PILOT IN

02:51:31.381 --> 02:51:34.283
NAPA AND SOLANO COUNTY IS ON MAY

02:51:34.350 --> 02:51:36.285
SIXTH ON JUST ABOUT TWO MONTHS

02:51:36.352 --> 02:51:36.953
FROM NOW.

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.655
WE'RE REPLACING OUR COMPUTER

02:51:38.721 --> 02:51:40.323
SYSTEM THAT WE'VE HAD IN PLACE

02:51:40.390 --> 02:51:41.991
FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS WITH

02:51:42.058 --> 02:51:43.693
THE TRANSFER SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN

02:51:43.760 --> 02:51:45.995
USED IN OTHER STATES THE MOST

02:51:46.062 --> 02:51:47.664
RECENT WAS THE YORK AND SO WE'VE.

02:51:47.730 --> 02:51:49.465
MOVED THAT CODE OVER MAKINGS AND

02:51:49.532 --> 02:51:50.533
NUMBER OF REVISIONS FOR

02:51:50.600 --> 02:51:51.701
CALIFORNIA.

02:51:51.768 --> 02:51:53.369
AND THEN SETTING GETTING GROCERY

02:51:53.436 --> 02:51:55.471
STORES AND ALL OF OUR LOCAL

02:51:55.538 --> 02:51:58.941
AGENCIES READY TO GO.

02:51:59.008 --> 02:52:01.177
THANK YOU. FOR YOUR COMMENTS

02:52:01.244 --> 02:52:04.113
FINANCE.

02:52:04.180 --> 02:52:07.050
SO -- IF.

02:52:07.116 --> 02:52:09.819
IT IF AND I WOULD MAKE NOTE AND

02:52:09.886 --> 02:52:11.854
I THINK OF BAD THAT SO BILL WERE

02:52:11.921 --> 02:52:12.955
ABOVE AVERAGE AND ARE WITH

02:52:13.022 --> 02:52:15.525
PARTICIPATION SO THAT'S GREAT --

02:52:15.591 --> 02:52:16.659
I THINK I CAO FRESH THOUGH I

02:52:16.726 --> 02:52:17.694
THINK THAT SORT OF THE OFFICE I

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:20.096
THINK WE'RE KIND OF LOW COMPARED

02:52:20.163 --> 02:52:22.532
TO OTHER STATES --

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:23.433
TERMS -- CAL

02:52:23.499 --> 02:52:24.534
FRESH OF DISSIPATION AND THEY

02:52:24.600 --> 02:52:25.535
HAVE I DO BELIEVE THEY HAVE A

02:52:25.601 --> 02:52:26.803
LOWER COVERAGE RATE THAN OTHER

02:52:26.869 --> 02:52:28.571
STRAIGHT YEAH SO --

02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:29.472
SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR PUTTING

02:52:29.539 --> 02:52:34.510
TRANSIT THE TWO TOGETHER AND IT

02:52:34.577 --> 02:52:36.646
SAYS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING --

02:52:36.713 --> 02:52:37.714
FOR IS IS YEAR.

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:39.615
BUT AS YOU'RE DOING THIS I GUESS

02:52:39.682 --> 02:52:40.717
HE SAID THERE ARE SOME

02:52:40.783 --> 02:52:42.652
INTERESTING FINDINGS --

02:52:42.719 --> 02:52:46.155
pASSUME YOU HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE

02:52:46.222 --> 02:52:47.657
A LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUFF LIKE

02:52:47.724 --> 02:52:49.792
THE SIMS IDEAS OR THINGS THAT

02:52:49.859 --> 02:52:51.360
WERE GOING TO DO.

02:52:51.427 --> 02:52:53.196
TO IMPROVE OUR WAY CREATES EVEN

02:52:53.262 --> 02:52:54.864
MORE I MEAN WE'RE AT WAS IS UP

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:57.200
WITH WAS FOR THE SIXTY SIXTY

02:52:57.266 --> 02:52:58.534
FIVE FIFTY FIVE PROCESO SO I

02:52:58.601 --> 02:52:59.202
MEAN.

02:52:59.268 --> 02:53:01.337
THAT'S IT SAYS THAT IT IS HARD

02:53:01.404 --> 02:53:03.339
TO GET CLOSE TO A HUNDRED GREAT --

02:53:03.406 --> 02:53:07.977
BUT THAT DALE DO YOU UNDERSTAND

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:09.145
WHAT KIND OF IN THE PROGRAM

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:10.546
CHANGES THE SEE HAPPENING AS A

02:53:10.613 --> 02:53:17.720
RESULT OF THIS EXAMINATION OF

02:53:17.787 --> 02:53:19.722
THIS COMPARISON OF DATA.

02:53:19.789 --> 02:53:20.623
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:21.824
WANT TO SEE IS IS ARE THE TYPES

02:53:21.891 --> 02:53:23.292
OF IS IT CONSISTENT ACROSS THE

02:53:23.359 --> 02:53:23.893
STATE OR ARE THERE DIFFERENT

02:53:23.960 --> 02:53:24.794
THINGS HAPPENING DIFFERENT PARTS

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:25.695
OF THE STATE.

02:53:25.762 --> 02:53:27.029
OF WIKI AND CAL FOR US OPERATE

02:53:27.096 --> 02:53:29.665
VERY DIFFERENTLY AND WE HAVE

02:53:29.732 --> 02:53:31.400
DIFFERENT PROVIDERS AND WITH

02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:32.535
WORK WE DON'T OPERATE THROUGH

02:53:32.602 --> 02:53:33.870
ALL COME COUNTY HEALTH

02:53:33.936 --> 02:53:36.072
DEPARTMENTS ONLY ABOUT FORTY

02:53:36.139 --> 02:53:36.572
DIFFERENT COUNTY HEALTH

02:53:36.639 --> 02:53:38.141
DEPARTMENTS.

02:53:38.207 --> 02:53:39.408
AND THEN WE HALLS ALSO HAVE A

02:53:39.475 --> 02:53:41.144
NUMBER OFNONPROFIT AGENCIES SO

02:53:41.210 --> 02:53:42.445
THE WICCAN ROMAN HAPPENS IN A

02:53:42.512 --> 02:53:44.680
DIFFERENT PLACE TO THERE MIGHT

02:53:44.747 --> 02:53:45.281
BE DIFFERENT THINGS HAPPENING

02:53:45.348 --> 02:53:46.516
THERE.

02:53:46.582 --> 02:53:47.850
BUT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE ADD

02:53:47.917 --> 02:53:50.820
DEMOGRAPHICALLY HAPPENING

02:53:50.887 --> 02:53:52.121
DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT PLACES

02:53:52.188 --> 02:53:53.456
AS WELL SO WE CAN DEFINITELY

02:53:53.523 --> 02:53:55.825
LOOK AT HOW DO WE BETTER PARTNER

02:53:55.892 --> 02:53:56.893
WITH -- AT

02:53:56.959 --> 02:53:57.927
THE WITH CAL FRESH OF THE

02:53:57.994 --> 02:53:59.862
ENROLLMENT SITE ARE WE LOSING

02:53:59.929 --> 02:54:01.631
PEOPLE AT A CERTAIN TIME DURING

02:54:01.697 --> 02:54:03.366
AND WE KNOW WITH CHILDREN THAT

02:54:03.432 --> 02:54:05.134
AROUND TEN MONTHS OR SO CHILDREN

02:54:05.201 --> 02:54:07.403
TEND TO START TO BEGIN TO DROP

02:54:07.470 --> 02:54:08.504
OFF THE WORK PROGRAM.

02:54:08.571 --> 02:54:09.939
AND HEY MIGHT UPTAKE IN THE COW

02:54:10.006 --> 02:54:11.707
FIRST PROGRAM AT THAT TIME SO IS

02:54:11.774 --> 02:54:13.476
THERE SOME KIND OF MESSAGING WE

02:54:13.543 --> 02:54:14.410
COULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO

02:54:14.477 --> 02:54:16.779
LEAVE ONE PROGRAM TO JOIN THE

02:54:16.846 --> 02:54:16.979
OTHER.

02:54:17.046 --> 02:54:19.549
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS.

02:54:19.615 --> 02:54:20.183
I JUST WANTED TO HAS TO THAT IS

02:54:20.249 --> 02:54:21.017
THAT.

02:54:21.083 --> 02:54:21.918
I THINK THAT THE INTERESTING

02:54:21.984 --> 02:54:22.819
QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:24.453
FOR ALL THREE PROGRAMS WHY DON'T

02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:25.555
YOU PARTICIPATE IN ALL THREE

02:54:25.621 --> 02:54:27.123
PROGRAMS MET SO I THINK THAT ALL

02:54:27.190 --> 02:54:28.191
THREE AGENCIES ARE VERY

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.592
INTERESTED IN THAT SO.

02:54:29.659 --> 02:54:30.526
WHERE DO YOU HAVE HIGHER

02:54:30.593 --> 02:54:32.061
PENETRATION OF MEDI CAL

02:54:32.128 --> 02:54:33.629
ENROLLMENT BUT NOT A BLANK AND

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:34.831
THEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IS IT

02:54:34.897 --> 02:54:36.399
REVERSE WHY WOULD THERE BE SOME

02:54:36.465 --> 02:54:37.433
PLACES WHERE THERE'S HIGHER

02:54:37.500 --> 02:54:38.968
WICKETLESS MEDIC HOUSE SO WE'RE

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:41.170
WORKING TOGETHER?

02:54:41.237 --> 02:54:42.505
TO TRY TO CREATE A YOU DON'T BUY

02:54:42.572 --> 02:54:44.207
DIRECTIONAL INFUSION OF

02:54:44.273 --> 02:54:45.842
INFORMATION AND SUPPORT IN

02:54:45.908 --> 02:54:48.077
TRYING TO GET ALL ELIGIBLE

02:54:48.144 --> 02:54:51.180
PEOPLE IN THE ENROLLED WHEREVER

02:54:51.247 --> 02:54:54.016
THEY CAN BE.

02:54:54.083 --> 02:54:55.084
BUT SINCE SAID THE SUBCOMMITTEE

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:56.719
ACTUALLY OVERSEAS ALL --

02:54:56.786 --> 02:54:57.687
THREE VERY VERY INTERESTED AS

02:54:57.753 --> 02:54:58.688
RESULTS AND ALSO HEARING FROM

02:54:58.754 --> 02:55:00.156
THE YEAR PARTNER AGENCIES AND

02:55:00.223 --> 02:55:02.992
THIS ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY THINK.

02:55:03.059 --> 02:55:04.360
I A YES AT THAT.

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:06.395
WOULD YOU GATHERING GUESSES THE

02:55:06.462 --> 02:55:08.731
OKAY WELL GIVEN THIS DATA WHAT

02:55:08.798 --> 02:55:12.001
THE HOW MUCH FOR HOT IS SO SO

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:13.903
YOU'RE IT DOES HAPPEN HOW THE

02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:15.471
HEAVY MORE PERCENT DO YOU THINK

02:55:15.538 --> 02:55:17.039
WE MIGHT BE A BUMP THIS UP THAT --

02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:17.940
BASED ON THE DATA THAT YOU'RE

02:55:18.007 --> 02:55:19.542
LOOKING AT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE

02:55:19.609 --> 02:55:21.344
YOU MISSING THAT PAVE WHETHER

02:55:21.410 --> 02:55:23.312
ALL THOSE PROGRAMS I REALIZED --

02:55:23.379 --> 02:55:24.347
MAKE THE VARIOUS BARRIERS AS TO

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:26.148
WHY THEY MIGHT STILL NOT WANT.

02:55:26.215 --> 02:55:27.450
TO ENROLL WORK OF THE QUALIFIED

02:55:27.516 --> 02:55:28.517
FOR THAT BUT AS YOU KNOW THE

02:55:28.584 --> 02:55:30.653
FACT WE QUESTIONS IF YOU QUALIFY

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:31.888
FOR ALL THREE ONE ACTION ROLLED

02:55:31.954 --> 02:55:32.722
ALL THREE BUT I MEAN.

02:55:32.788 --> 02:55:37.994
WHAT WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE

02:55:38.060 --> 02:55:40.930
POSSIBILITY AT LEAST OF WHO THEY

02:55:40.997 --> 02:55:42.665
ARE BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN TO BE

02:55:42.732 --> 02:55:44.100
CAO FRESH?

02:55:44.166 --> 02:55:45.501
I MEAN DO YOU HAVE IT'S THE

02:55:45.568 --> 02:55:46.836
SENSE OF THE SCALE OF THAT.

02:55:46.903 --> 02:55:48.938
I THINK ONCE WE COMPLETE THE

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:50.172
MEDIC HOW MUCH WE MADE A QUICK

02:55:50.239 --> 02:55:51.140
TO ANSWER THAT BE OKAY.

02:55:51.207 --> 02:55:54.110
THERE MAY BE INDIVIDUALS THAT.

02:55:54.176 --> 02:55:55.745
ARE IN NEITHER CAO FRESHER WORK

02:55:55.811 --> 02:55:57.613
AND THAT WOULD AND SO JUST

02:55:57.680 --> 02:55:58.714
LOOKING AT CAO FRESH A WILL BE

02:55:58.781 --> 02:56:00.149
MISSING A NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT

02:56:00.216 --> 02:56:02.351
WE'RE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS THAT.

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:04.053
THERE WILL BE MORE EL AND MORE

02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.188
INDIVIDUALS IN MEDI CAL THAT ARE

02:56:06.255 --> 02:56:07.623
NOT IN EITHER OF THE NUTRITION

02:56:07.690 --> 02:56:08.791
PROGRAM SO WHEN YOU THINK YOU

02:56:08.858 --> 02:56:10.993
MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND THAT OUT

02:56:11.060 --> 02:56:13.529
BY -- WE ARE

02:56:13.596 --> 02:56:15.398
OUR REPORT IS IN THE REVIEW

02:56:15.464 --> 02:56:16.899
PROCESS THAT OUR DEPARTMENT

02:56:16.966 --> 02:56:17.833
RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE WE'RE GETTING

02:56:17.900 --> 02:56:20.703
CLOSE OKAY SO MAYBE BY TIME WE

02:56:20.770 --> 02:56:22.071
TALK TO YOU AGAIN.

02:56:22.138 --> 02:56:23.139
WE HAVE A STRATEGY FOR

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:24.907
INCREASING PARTICIPATION I THINK

02:56:24.974 --> 02:56:26.008
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AS THIS

02:56:26.075 --> 02:56:28.377
NEW DATA LINCOLN RIGHT REALLY

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:30.112
UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT'S VERY NEW.

02:56:30.179 --> 02:56:30.780
TO THE AGENCIES ARE STILL

AND THIS AND LOOK AT THE

03:04:00.262 --> 03:04:01.663
RESEARCH ABOUT IMPACTS CERTAINLY

03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:03.632
YELLOW WE TALK ABOUT THE TWO

03:04:03.699 --> 03:04:05.734

PARTNERSHIP ABLE TO MODEL

03:04:11.740 --> 03:04:12.975
EXTENSIVE EVALUATION ABOUT ITS

03:04:13.041 --> 03:04:15.644
EFFECTIVENESS I THINK THE

03:04:15.711 --> 03:04:16.645
CONCERN IS --

03:04:16.712 --> 03:04:18.847
OTHER INTENSIVE USES VERY HIGHLY

03:04:18.914 --> 03:04:20.616
TRAINED PERSONNEL ALSO TEND TO

03:04:20.682 --> 03:04:22.251
BE FAIRLY EXPENSIVE --

03:04:22.317 --> 03:04:25.053
AND AND SO I GUESS.

03:04:25.120 --> 03:04:26.755

WORKING WITH THE LOCALS ABOUT

03:04:29.625 --> 03:04:30.959
LOOKING AT OTHER MODELS BUT I

03:04:31.026 --> 03:04:32.795
GUESS THE OTHER PART THOUGH.

03:04:32.861 --> 03:04:33.796
AND I REALIZE SOMETIMES THERE

03:04:33.862 --> 03:04:35.964
MAY BE A BIT OF A POSSE OF DATA

03:04:36.031 --> 03:04:36.565
IS IS THAT WE ALSO WANT TO BE

03:04:36.632 --> 03:04:37.399
SURE.

03:04:37.466 --> 03:04:39.401
IS THAT THE MODELS THAT THERE

03:04:39.468 --> 03:04:40.903
THAT THIS IS ALSO BASED ON

03:04:40.969 --> 03:04:42.271
EVALUATION DATA SHOWS THAT

03:04:42.337 --> 03:04:43.872
MODELS EFFECTIVE RIGHT --

03:04:43.939 --> 03:04:47.376

NOW DAVID TRYING TO LOOK FOR

03:04:50.979 --> 03:04:52.314
LESS EXPENSIVE LESS INTENSIVE

03:04:52.381 --> 03:04:55.184
MODELS AND WE HEAR SACRAMENTO WE

03:04:55.250 --> 03:04:56.752
WE WE HAD DINNER SALLY

03:04:56.819 --> 03:04:57.820
PARTNERSHIP WE ALSO BIRTH AND

03:04:57.886 --> 03:05:00.189
BEYOND AND SO FORTH AND I I I I

03:05:00.255 --> 03:05:00.823
THINK THAT --

03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:04.059
CERTAINLY OF COURSE WE WANT TO

03:05:04.126 --> 03:05:07.429
WORK WITH THE OF THE LOCAL HELP

03:05:07.496 --> 03:05:08.530
YOU BUY BE ASKING THIS BUT I

03:05:08.597 --> 03:05:09.431
MEAN YOU NEED TO ALSO PEOPLE

03:05:09.498 --> 03:05:10.866
NEED TO SHOW THE EVIDENCE THAT

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:12.901
THEIR MODEL.

03:05:12.968 --> 03:05:14.670
WORKS RIGHT WHAT THAT IS HOW HOW

03:05:14.736 --> 03:05:16.672
MUCH IMPACT THAT PARTICULAR

03:05:16.738 --> 03:05:18.140
MODEL BECAUSE I MY GUESS IS IS

03:05:18.207 --> 03:05:19.274
THAT I DON'T KNOW ALL THE

03:05:19.341 --> 03:05:20.742
DIFFERENT MODELS THAT MY GUESS

03:05:20.809 --> 03:05:22.144
IS THAT.

03:05:22.211 --> 03:05:23.812
THE NURSE FAMILY PARTNERSHIP IS

03:05:23.879 --> 03:05:25.681
PROBABLY THE MOST INTENSIVE WITH

03:05:25.747 --> 03:05:26.381
HOW THIS HIGHLY TRAINED FOR

03:05:26.448 --> 03:05:27.149
STYLE THING SOME OF THE MODELS

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:28.684
ARE EVEN MORE SO THAN THAT

03:05:28.750 --> 03:05:30.486
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE THAT SO THE

03:05:30.552 --> 03:05:31.420
AND USUALLY PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

03:05:31.487 --> 03:05:33.121
AT HOW CAN I DO IT.

03:05:33.188 --> 03:05:34.022
FOR YOU KNOW STRETCH MY DOLLARS

03:05:34.089 --> 03:05:35.123
FATHER REACH MORE FAMILIES IT'S

03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:36.525
UNDER A LOTS OF VERY IMPORTANT

03:05:36.592 --> 03:05:38.260
GOOD REASONS --

03:05:38.327 --> 03:05:39.995
BUT AT SAME TIME FORCE --

03:05:40.062 --> 03:05:40.929
YELLED THEN THE QUESTION IS IS

03:05:40.996 --> 03:05:42.998
THAT WHAT KIND OF IMPACT EVERY

03:05:43.065 --> 03:05:44.333
GO STILL ACHIEVE THE SAME KIND

03:05:44.399 --> 03:05:46.401
OF OUTCOMES THAT WE HAD WITH THE

03:05:46.468 --> 03:05:48.637
OTHER MODELS SO --

03:05:48.704 --> 03:05:49.771
THEN KNOWING THAT FIRST FIVE

03:05:49.838 --> 03:05:52.107
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED A LOT I MEAN

03:05:52.174 --> 03:05:52.975
THOUGH THAT MAY THE FIRST FIVE

03:05:53.041 --> 03:05:54.409
TO DONE EVALUATION TO LOOK AT

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:58.180
SOME OF THAT EVALUATION DATA AND

03:05:58.247 --> 03:05:59.381
SAY OKAY NOW ONLY.

03:05:59.448 --> 03:06:00.215
YOU KNOW I KNOW THIS IS THE

03:06:00.282 --> 03:06:01.183
MODEL YOU USING BUT WHAT KIND OF

03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:02.117
VALUATION DO YOU HAVE THAT SHOWS

03:06:02.184 --> 03:06:04.119
THAT THIS IS.

03:06:04.186 --> 03:06:05.153
GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE ONE MAKE

03:06:05.220 --> 03:06:07.256
THAT INVESTMENT IS WE'RE LOOKING

03:06:07.322 --> 03:06:08.590
AT WHICH MODELS WHAT ACTUALLY.

03:06:08.657 --> 03:06:10.359
I GUESS TECHNICALLY ADOPTER

03:06:10.425 --> 03:06:12.628
CHURCHES ARE EXCEPT FOR FOR THIS

03:06:12.694 --> 03:06:14.863
KIND OF FUNDING SIDE OF YOU ADD

03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:16.965
ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT.

03:06:17.032 --> 03:06:18.634
WELL WITH IT HFA MODEL WE DO

03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:19.835
COLLECT DATA SO WE'RE VERY AWARE

03:06:19.902 --> 03:06:21.169
OF OF THE NEED TO COLLECT DATA

03:06:21.236 --> 03:06:22.437
AND ACTUALLY SO RESULTS AND SO

03:06:22.504 --> 03:06:23.505
THAT WILL BE A CRITERIA WHEN

03:06:23.572 --> 03:06:24.806
WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR AT OUR

03:06:24.873 --> 03:06:26.341
COUNTIES LIKE WHAT MODELS ARE

03:06:26.408 --> 03:06:27.342
YOU CURRENTLY.

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:29.311
ALSO UTILIZING IN YOUR COUNTY

03:06:29.378 --> 03:06:30.946
AND HOW ARE YOU COLLECTING DATA

03:06:31.013 --> 03:06:32.114
SO WE DO HAVE THAT COMMITMENT TO

03:06:32.180 --> 03:06:32.915
REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THIS

03:06:32.981 --> 03:06:34.116
INVESTMENT IS REALLY GOING TO

03:06:34.182 --> 03:06:35.684
CHANGE LIVES.

03:06:35.751 --> 03:06:37.085
AND NOT JUST.

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:38.720
TO START UP A MODEL AND NOT AND

03:06:38.787 --> 03:06:41.757
THEN WALK AWAY FROM THAT WE HOW

03:06:41.823 --> 03:06:43.325
WE ARE IMPLEMENTING OUR OTHER.

03:06:43.392 --> 03:06:45.460
MODELS OKAY AND I UNDERSTAND THE

03:06:45.527 --> 03:06:47.496
HHS HAS A CIVIL LIST THE

03:06:47.563 --> 03:06:49.498
DIFFERENT MODELS THAT THEY'VE

03:06:49.565 --> 03:06:50.232
HAD.

03:06:50.299 --> 03:06:53.735
IN THE TRAITOR EFFECTIVENESS

03:06:53.802 --> 03:06:55.237
SELF.

03:06:55.304 --> 03:06:56.972
ALL RIGHT I COULD ADD TO THIS

03:06:57.039 --> 03:06:58.507
PLEASE WE WE WILL BEGIN BY

03:06:58.574 --> 03:06:59.675
LOOKING OUT THE TWENTY MODELS

03:06:59.741 --> 03:07:01.310
THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED AT THE

03:07:01.376 --> 03:07:02.611
FEDERAL LEVEL AS BEING EVIDENCE

03:07:02.678 --> 03:07:04.012
BASED MODELS.

03:07:04.079 --> 03:07:04.880
BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT REMEMBERS

03:07:04.947 --> 03:07:06.782
THAT NOT EVERY EVIDENCE BASED

03:07:06.848 --> 03:07:09.785
MODEL COMES WITH NOT ONLY THE

03:07:09.851 --> 03:07:12.020
IMPLEMENTATION BUT THE TRAINING

03:07:12.087 --> 03:07:14.156
AND A DATA PLATFORM RIGHT SO

03:07:14.222 --> 03:07:15.223
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO ALSO

03:07:15.290 --> 03:07:17.225
ESTIMATE AS YOU KNOW WHAT COMES

03:07:17.292 --> 03:07:18.794
ALREADY PREPARED WHAT WOULD WE

03:07:18.860 --> 03:07:20.128
HAVE TO DEVELOP.

03:07:20.195 --> 03:07:22.564
AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT --

03:07:22.631 --> 03:07:25.834
WHILE HOME VISITING --

03:07:25.901 --> 03:07:27.569
IN GENERAL.

03:07:27.636 --> 03:07:28.270
I BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF

03:07:28.337 --> 03:07:29.805
BENEFIT FOR VULNERABLE FAMILIES.

03:07:29.871 --> 03:07:31.607
THERE IS A HUGE BURDEN ON LOCAL

03:07:31.673 --> 03:07:32.474
COUNTY'S AND TRYING TO

03:07:32.541 --> 03:07:33.942
COORDINATE THESE EFFORTS AND

03:07:34.009 --> 03:07:35.811
THAT TOO WE'RE INVOLVED WITH OUR

03:07:35.877 --> 03:07:38.113
LOCAL M. C. H. DIRECTORS ABOUT.

03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:40.015
YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU CHOOSE WHAT

03:07:40.082 --> 03:07:42.184
TO PUT WOMEN IN WHAT ARE THE

03:07:42.250 --> 03:07:42.951
DIFFERENT OPTIONS HOW DO YOU

03:07:43.018 --> 03:07:44.753
TRIAGE AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE

03:07:44.820 --> 03:07:46.521
TO SORT DECISIONS AND THEN

03:07:46.588 --> 03:07:48.123
IDEALLY WE WOULD.

03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:49.124
LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO SO

03:07:49.191 --> 03:07:51.059
THEN WHAT WHAT DID YOU HOPE TO

03:07:51.126 --> 03:07:52.494
ACHIEVE IN DID YOU ACHIEVE WHAT

03:07:52.561 --> 03:07:54.229
YOU WANTED BUT THAT REFER ALL.

03:07:54.296 --> 03:07:56.064
SO IT'S IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THAT

03:07:56.131 --> 03:07:57.599
COMES WITH A BURDEN.

03:07:57.666 --> 03:07:59.668
ON NOT ONLY FOR FOR US TO HELP

03:07:59.735 --> 03:08:01.303
TO GUIDE THIS DISCUSSION BUT A

03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:03.438
HUGE BURDEN FOR OUR LOCALS TO TO

03:08:03.505 --> 03:08:07.609
MANAGE RIGHT NOW.

03:08:07.676 --> 03:08:09.144
WELL I THINK THERE'S STILL LIKE

03:08:09.211 --> 03:08:11.213
A PRE SHEET THE VESTMENTS IN

03:08:11.279 --> 03:08:12.881
HOME VISITATION --

03:08:12.948 --> 03:08:13.915
BOTH BY THE PREVIOUS

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:14.850
ADMINISTRATION THAT WE PUT IN

03:08:14.916 --> 03:08:17.753
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND ALSO SO

03:08:17.819 --> 03:08:18.487
AND ALSO.

03:08:18.553 --> 03:08:19.988
I THINK ABOUT HOW THE DIFFERENT

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:21.923
PIECES COORDINATE EIGHT GOV AND

03:08:21.990 --> 03:08:24.359
IT'S GREAT WE HAVE LOCAL FOLKS

03:08:24.426 --> 03:08:25.661
TO STEPPED UP THE NINE YOU'LL

03:08:25.727 --> 03:08:26.228
SUPPORTED.

03:08:26.294 --> 03:08:28.730
FUNDING FOR THAT WHEN I WAS ON

03:08:28.797 --> 03:08:29.331
THE FIRST FIVE COMMISSION WAY

03:08:29.398 --> 03:08:33.935
BACK ACTIVITY AND AND THEN THE

03:08:34.002 --> 03:08:35.904
STATE INVESTMENT TO AND BE SURE

03:08:35.971 --> 03:08:36.938
THAT WE TRY TO COORDINATE

03:08:37.005 --> 03:08:38.473
BETWEEN THEM CELL.

03:08:38.540 --> 03:08:40.909
IF IT'S HELPFUL TO YOU WE ALSO

03:08:40.976 --> 03:08:43.578
CO LEAD THE STATE INTERAGENCY

03:08:43.645 --> 03:08:45.614
TOYS ON ON HOME VISITING I

03:08:45.681 --> 03:08:49.685
PLEDGE TO HERE'S AN INTERAGENCY

03:08:49.751 --> 03:08:51.953
TEAM OUT OF THIS.

03:08:52.020 --> 03:08:53.221
SO IT WAS ORIGINALLY --

03:08:53.288 --> 03:08:55.323
WE STARTED THAT AS WHEN HOME

03:08:55.390 --> 03:08:56.558
VISITING FEDERAL DOLLARS CAME

03:08:56.625 --> 03:08:57.959
HERE BUT SINCE CAL WORKS IS NOW

03:08:58.026 --> 03:08:59.294
INVOLVED WE'VE EXPANDED THEM IN

03:08:59.361 --> 03:09:00.429
PERSON I ALSO PARTICIPATE SO

03:09:00.495 --> 03:09:01.596
WE'RE MAKING AN EFFORT AT THE

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:03.231
STATE LEVEL TO COORDINATE AND

A LOT OF TECHNOLOGY WHEN THEY GO

03:28:55.522 --> 03:28:57.091

03:29:00.127 --> 03:29:01.862
BUT THE STATE PROGRAM IN THE

REALLY EXT EXPEDITE HORIZONTAL

03:29:15.276 --> 03:29:16.577
INTEGRATION SO THAT WE CAN

03:29:16.644 --> 03:29:18.746

03:29:19.914 --> 03:29:21.115
MEDI CAL AND WORK THAT WOULD BE

THAT BUT THAT'S VITALLY

03:29:26.820 --> 03:29:29.089
IMPORTANT --

03:29:29.156 --> 03:29:30.958
SECONDLY I BROUGHT THIS UP THE

03:29:31.025 --> 03:29:32.426

03:29:34.495 --> 03:29:36.263
CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE.

03:29:36.330 --> 03:29:37.665
IN THOSE CONTRACTS --

03:29:37.731 --> 03:29:39.633
WERE QUITE INFLEXIBLE AND IT WAS

03:29:39.700 --> 03:29:41.201
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO SPEND ALL

03:29:41.268 --> 03:29:42.269
THEIR MONEY SO WHEN YOU COMBINE

03:29:42.336 --> 03:29:43.537

03:29:43.604 --> 03:29:44.738
PARTICIPATION.

03:29:44.805 --> 03:29:45.572
IT'S ONLY GOING TO INCREASE THE

03:29:45.639 --> 03:29:48.008
FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT.

03:29:48.075 --> 03:29:49.343

THIS CONTRACT IS VERY

03:29:52.012 --> 03:29:54.181
CHALLENGING BUT THEY REALLY NEED

03:29:54.248 --> 03:29:55.115
SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO SPEND

03:29:55.182 --> 03:29:55.950
THOSE DOLLARS WHEN THEY COME

03:29:56.016 --> 03:29:57.418
HERE AND ADDRESS ALL THE THINGS

03:29:57.484 --> 03:29:58.419

FACTORS EACH YEAR.

03:30:03.290 --> 03:30:04.525
AND THEN THIRDLY WE WOULD HOPE

03:30:04.591 --> 03:30:06.226

03:30:13.334 --> 03:30:14.568
AND THE STATE'S STAFF HAVE BEEN

03:30:14.635 --> 03:30:15.703
WORKING REALLY HARD TO MAKE THAT

03:30:15.769 --> 03:30:18.172
WORK BUT WHEN THE LOCAL AGENCIES

03:30:18.238 --> 03:30:18.706
ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAKING

03:30:18.772 --> 03:30:20.140
PAYROLL --

03:30:20.207 --> 03:30:21.475
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS SLOW AND

CALIFORNIA BUT THERE WAS ONE

03:35:53.573 --> 03:35:55.242

IF THIS DISEASE WERE A CITY

03:36:20.100 --> 03:36:21.635

03:36:21.702 --> 03:36:23.370
IN CALIFORNIA.

03:36:23.437 --> 03:36:24.871
WE ALSO KNOW THAT HALF OF PEOPLE

03:36:24.938 --> 03:36:26.239
WITH THIS CONDITION HAVE NOT
