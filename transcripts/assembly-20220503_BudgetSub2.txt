GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS PAUL FINISHER TANG WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE TRAILER BILL AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTS. THE INTENTION BEHIND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IS NOT TO CHANGE THE OVERALL PURPOSE OR INTENT OF THE PROGRAM. BUT THE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO AREAS THAT NEED FURTHER CLARIFICATION. STREAMLINE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESSES AND REMOVE BARRIERS THAT HAVE BEEN-IDENTIFIED AS THE PROGRAM HS BEGUN MOVING FORWARD WITH IMPLEMENTATION. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE MONITORING AND EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM AT THE BEING ROLLED OUT. NOTABLE CHANGES INCLUDE ADDING CLARIFYING LANGUAGE TO OPERATIONALIZE THE VISION AROUND THE SERVICES COORDINATION FUNDING. THE FUNDING ALLOCATION FOR COORDINATION IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABILITY BY HELPING SCHOOLS SECURE LONG TERM FUNDING STREAMS AND COMMITMENTS AND COORDINATE WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO SUPPORT ONGOING PROGRAMMING. SCHOOL SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN COORDINATION AND SUSTAINABILITY WORK FROM THE BEGINNING AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. INCORPORATING THE COORDINATION GRANT AS PART OF IMPLEMENTATION WILL STREAMLINE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANTS AND BEST SUPPORT A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS LONG TERM SUCCESS. BY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR A MULTI AGENCY COORDINATION FROM DAY ONE. BUILDING ON THE FOCUS OF COURT ON COORDINATION WE PROPOSED ALLOCATING SIXTY MILLION OF THE EXISTING THREE BILLION FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO HELP COORDINATE SERVICES. PROGRAMS AND OTHER RESOURCES BETWEEN COUNTY LEVEL PARTNERS AND COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IN THE REGION. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SERVICE COORDINATION HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL BETWEEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION HEALTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES. AS WELL AS REGIONAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THIS FUNDING WOULD BE FORMULA BASED WITH A MINIMUM ALLOCATION OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND NO MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR PER OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY ON HOW QUALIFIED ENTITIES CAN SPEND LOCAL GRANT FUNDS. WE PROPOSE TO ALLOW AUTHORITIES TO RETAIN UP TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR 10% OF THE TOTAL WARD FOR IT SITES EACH YEAR. TO SUPPORT ADMINISTRATION OVERSIGHT AND COORDINATION OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. FINALLY WE PROPOSE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION OVER FIVE YEARS FOR ANNUAL FORMATIVE ASSESSMENTS TO EVALUATE THE PROGRESS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. MAKE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENTS AND SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND LESSONS LEARNED FOR NEW GRANTEES THAT COME ON BOARD. WE EXPECT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL BE AN ERROR THAT PROCESS AND THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY BE NEEDED IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. RECEIVE FEEDBACK AND ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY EMERGE. WITH THAT SAID THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS A STARTING POINT FOR CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON REFINING THE LANGUAGE TO FIND THE BEST PATH FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL.

IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH AND THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN PARENTS WERE REQUIRED TO SIGN WAIVERS TO ENROLL IN OUR FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. FEATURES A CAPITATED GOING- AT TWELVE THIRTEEN YEARS NOW BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE ITS VALUES. THEY TEACH STUDENTS TO USE THEIR OWN DATA TO SET GOALS AND IMPROVE WITH THE SUPPORT OF THEIR PARENTS AND AS A RESULT OF THE SCHOOLS DECADELONG COMMITMENT TO COLLECTING AND USING ITS OWN DATA. THE UCLA COMMUNITY SCHOOL GRADUATED 52% OF ITS SENIORS LAST YEAR WITH THE. STATE SEAL OF BI LITERACY. SO THE TAKE AWAY HERE CHRISTENSEN. COMMUNITY BASED DATA. THAT CAPTURES THE COMPLEXITY IS TO DEVELOPMENT. LEARNING WEALTHY. AND AT THE STATE LEVEL USE DATA AS WELL AS STORYTELLING TO INFORM IMPLEMENTATION AND CELEBRATE PROGRESS.

GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS ALLISON YOSHIMOTO TERRY THE CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ANGELES HAS BEEN COLLABORATING NATIONALLY IN THE INVESTMENT AND DELIVERY OF COMMUNITY SCHOOL COLORS AND SUPPORTS. ALONG WITH OUR PARTNERS THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TODAY TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO BETTER SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES SERVED THROUGH THE CREATION AND EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THIS TWO POINT NINE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IS INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE. AS MR ZIMMER DR HUNDRED OTHERS SPEAKERS TO SHARE TODAY THE WORK HAS BEEN ONGOING LEAD AGENCY THAT WRAPS SUPPORT AROUND AND WITHIN OUR SCHOOLS WE ALSO HAVE. COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS AND IN ADDITION THE DISTRICT L. UNIFIED HAS UPLIFTED OUR OWN. PROGRAM AND PRESENTLY THIRTY FOUR COMMUNITY SCHOOL SUPPORTED BY THE DISTRICT HAVE ALSO BEEN DESIGNATED. RIGHT NOW I'M SCHOOLS IN COLLABORATION WITH MANY SCHOOL STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS COACHES COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND NATIONALLY BY NATIONAL AND LABOUR PARTNERS. AT LAST AS UNIFIED WILL FORWARD. TO DEVELOP A PLAN NEXT. THERE'S PRIORITY THAT SERVICE ONE IS THAT EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES AS A PRIORITY AREA. AT IN ADDITION IT'S WEEKS AS WE FOCUS ON EXPANDED LEARNING TIME AND THE OTHER THREE PILLARS I WE ALSO WANT TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON CULTURALLY RESPONSIVE FIRST TEACHING AND LEARNING FOR EVERY CHILD. AND THE INCORPORATION AND BREEDING OF OTHER FUNDING SOURCES SUCH AS PROJECT BASED LEARNING LINKS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE REAL WORLD WELL PURPOSE THEY'RE LEARNING HAVE RELATIVELY MANY DEVELOP TO THEM. ADMINISTRATIVE IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIND COLLABORATION DISTRIBUTED LEADERSHIP AND CREATING A POSITIVE SCHOOL CULTURE IS THE SPECIFICS SET THAT ARE ADMINISTRATORS NEED SUPPORT WITH CAPACITY BUILDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COOK ING SUPPORTS OUR TOP PRIORITY. ADMINISTRATORS AS YOU KNOW DO EVERYTHING RELATED TO PERSONNEL INSTRUCTION CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT COMPLIANCE THE LEAD WITH POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT AND OVERSEEING ALL OPERATIONAL ISSUES AND IT'S IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME THAT WE COLLABORATE. WITH OUR ADMINISTRATORS TO RETHINK THEIR ROLE OF RESPONSIBILITIES AND THAT COCHING SUPPORT IS A TOP PRIORITY. ALSO AS WE WORK WITH OUR FEDERAL. OUT WE- REALLY ALONG WITH OTHER DISTRICTS HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE THIS PERSISTENT SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE AND THAT'S REALLY TOP OF MIND FOR US BECAUSE THIS WORK TAKES TIME. TO DO WELL. NUMBER ONE OF ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO THINK ABOUT OFFICIALLY BREEDING FUNDING AND LEVERAGING FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR EXAMPLE FOR MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT MANAGED CARE OR OTHER FEDERAL STATE LOCAL FUNDING STREAMS IN A TARGETED WAY WOULD BE OF SUPPORT TO S. FOR EXAMPLE OUR DIVISION OF STUDENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO MAXIMIZE YOUR REIMBURSEMENT OPPORTUNITIES CIVIL CLOSER TO BECOMING A DISTRICT OPERATED SELF SUSTAINING HUMANS HUMAN SERVICE ENTITY BY LEVERAGING COMMUNITY START COMMUNITY SCHOOL FUNDING. OUR MENTAL SCHOOL OUR SCHOOL WITH HEALTH SERVICES. I IN CONSTANT IN COLLABORATION WITH UNLESS COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. CAN ALSO DELIVERED STRONG SERVICES TO OUR FAMILIES TO REALLY COMBAT THE HOUSING AND SECURITY IS THE JOB OF SECURITIES IN THE FOOD INSECURITIES THAT OUR FAMILY CENTER AT OFTEN ARE BARRIERS TO STUDENTS SUCCEEDING ACADEMICALLY ALLOWS OR THIS REINVESTMENT. IT PREVENTATIVE CARE EARLY INTERVENTION CARE AND INTENSIVE SERVICES AS WELL. I IN ADDITION TO THIS IDEA OF READING FUNDING HOW WE BRAID SUPPORTS FOR THE COUNTY THE STATE THE STATE THE COUNTY DISTRICT LEVELS IN REGARDS TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEEDED AND ALSO ACADEMIC SUPPORTS NEED FOR TUTORING AND ADDITIONAL MULTI TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS. AND IF WE FIND STATE COUNTY AT DISTRICTS SEPARATELY- OUR STUDENTS ARE IN SCHOOL SO IT BE IT HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE AGAIN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES AND INCENTIVES TO BRAID FUNDING AND SUPPORTS THEY HAVE A REALLY TRULY REPREHENSIBLE SERVICE COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL UP WHERE THE STUDENTS SAID EVERY DAY IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND LASTLY. THIS WILL TAKE LOCALLY DRIVEN WORK TO REIMAGINE THE USE OF ALL CAPS FINDS OUT THESE COULD BE STRUCTURED AROUND THE FOUR PILLARS- THAT ARE CALLED OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL FRAMEWORK. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO LEVERAGING THESE DOLLARS TO PRIORITIZE PREVENTION RATHER THAN INTERVENTION- TO WORK FROM TO WORK TO BECOME FAMILY SUPPORTERS. RATHER THAN REPORTERS AND TO REALLY ADDRESS BABY TO ADULT SERVICES AND THE WORK THAT WE DO. SO WETHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND LEADERSHIP UNTIL THE SPEAKERS THAT WERE HERE TODAY AT THE INCREASED FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOL IN SUPPORT OF THE MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA B. PLEASE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU A LOT TO CHEW ON THERE. AND I KNOW- MEMBERS HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THIS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROPOSAL BUT I KNOW WE HAVE. FIRST TIME WE HAVE BOTH TURN A LITTLE BIT SO LET'S JUST DONALD HERE REYES HERE WALDRON FONG HERE. OKAY WE'LL START WITH THE QUESTIONS ON THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ISSUE MR DOLLAR. THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE- THE PRESENT AND- I DON'T THINK UNIFIED TOO MANY PEOPLE AGAINST COMMUNITY SCHOOLS I THE FACT THAT WE NEED THEM. OPERANDS OF MODEL AND DOING IT AT THE SCHOOL SUCH AS A GOOD ONE THING I WOULD QUESTION THOSE THE USE OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MONEY FOR ALL OF THE EFFORTS SOME OF THE EFFORTS LIKELY COMPORT WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IN ITS MISSION SOME OF THE EFFORTS LIKELY DO NOT COMPORT WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SO I QUESTION A SOME OF THE USE OF THE MONEY- GOING TO COMMUNITY SCHOOLS NOT THAT I OPPOSE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS BUT- THAT I WANNA MAKE SURE THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS AIMED AT THE CORE MISSION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH IS TO EDUCATE. IN THE CLASSROOM. BUT WITH THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION IT'S UNLIKELY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. THE COORDINATION GRANTS THAT SUPPORT THIS. OF COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT IS. THE ONGOING NESS IF YOU WILL OF CAN SCHOOLS WE WHY WOULD. WHY WOULD WE- WANT TO US- ELIMINATE THE- THE COORDINATION GRANTS MAYBE SOMEONE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD COMMENT ON THAT THANK YOU. ALL FINISHED TANK THE PARTMINER FINANCE. DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSED TOTALLY THE CORONATION GRANTS BETWEEN. IT AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD AT COORDINATION OF COMPONENTS AND- INCLUDE. MAKING SURE THAT A FIFTY PLAN FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND ALSO COORDINATING WITH OTHER OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND PARTNERS TO ENSURE LONG TERM PROGRAMMING AND SO WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS WORK AND SCHOOLS ARE STARTING THIS WORK IN GETTING THIS WORK FROM DAY ONE. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE INCORPORATED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD AND SPELLED IT OUT IN TRAILER BILL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF CREATING A SUSTAINABILITY PLANNING AND COORDINATING SERVICES AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. I THINK I GOT MOST OF THAT. SO IT'S GONNA PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. WALK WE DO SO TO THEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO HOW DOES THAT. HOW DOES THAT END UP BEING. HELPING THIS COORDINATION COME- AND- AT SECURING LONG TERM FUNDING STREAMS AND COMMITMENTS AND COORDINATING WITH COMPUTER COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO SUPPORT ONGOING PROGRAMMING. AND SO WE'VE INCORPORATED THAT AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. BY INCLUDING AND- THOSE COME. AT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANT AND WE WAS FOR THE COORDINATION. GRANT INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANT. GREAT THANK YOU I THINK ONE WAY WE CAN ADDRESSES THE LEGISLATURE COULD ADDRESSES. IS LONG THE MONEY IS BEING USED FOR A LOT NINETY EIGHT PURPOSES WE CAN INCREASE THE BASE GRANT. AND THEN COULD HAVE A LEEWAY. IF SEARCH. TO GO TO SCHOOL MODEL AT SOME SCHOOLS LATEST WERE ALL. IT MAY BE. OF WITHOUT FRIEND SCHOOLS OUT OF THE GATE. RIGHT IN THE BASE ALLOCATION. THERE'LL BE MORE MONEY. FOR DISTRICTS TO USE. TO PUT FORWARD. AT TO MOVE FORWARD IN EFFORTS LIKE THIS NOT ALWAYS OUT AND- PARTNERSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT BUDGET WE'RE DOING THIS ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS. IT'S GOING TO COLLAPSE NOT SUSTAINABLE- MORE WERE ALWAYS GOING OUT AND SEEKING CORPORATE HELP OR SOME TYPE OF. THIRD PARTY TO HELP US OUT- THAT'S- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S ONE THINGS BECOME TENUOUS AND NOT SUSTAINABLE QUITE FRANKLY FOR MY POINT. AS ONE PERSON LEAVES THAT PERSON KIND OF AS THE LYNCH. AND THEN THIS MODEL COLLAPSES AT A SCHOOL OR DISTRICT. SO AGAIN NOTHING FOR YOU TO RESPOND TO TODAY ON THAT FRONT BUT JUST THAT IF WE DO- SIGNIFICANTLY FUND SCHOOLS BETTER. WE CAN SUPPORT EFFORTS LIKE THIS WHERE APPROPRIATE WITH NINETY EIGHT MONEY THANK YOU. DR CHOI IN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRANCE. THE DOCTOR AND THEN SOMEONE FOR DOCTOR FONG.

WAY YOU FRAME IT WITHOUT THEM THE PARTNERSHIP DAY AND LIST AND LEARNING TO ON THE GROUND IS REALLY AND I JUST WANTED TO ASSEMBLY FOX GIVE A BIT OF CUT FROM THE FROM A THIS LEVEL- WE DID IN IRAQ BUT- THAT'S THAT'S MY- THAT ON OUR COMMUNITIES IMITATION WHICH OF COURSE WAS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR TRADITIONAL DATA SOURCES DURING THAT TIME- SO IT WAS MORE THE QUALITATIVE SIDE. WITHOUT THE ATTENDANCE HAD IMPROVED ENGAGEMENT WAS MORE APPARENTAND HIGHER AND OPINIONS WERE THAT THE SCHOOLS WERE MORE RESPONSIVE AND INTEGRATED SUPPORTS AND SERVICES LIKE MENTAL MEDICAL HEALTH WERE MORE AVAILABLE AT AT OUR. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. WE'RE RIGHT ENGAGE. IN A MY- AND THAT MAKES METHODS. RESEARCH IS GETTING OFF THE GROUND WHERE WE WILL LOOK AT TRADITIONAL OUTCOME DATA LIKE IT'S SMARTER BALANCE ATTENDANCE WE CLASSIFICATION. REPEATED APRIL FOR INSIST. SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO CROSS REFERENCE TRADITIONAL STUDENT OUTCOME DATA WITH THAT. THAT PLACE IS FROM THE FIELD AND INNOCENT VOICES FAMILY VOICES. EMPLOYEE VOICES. AS WELL AS AN INDEPENDENT IF WE WERE ABLE TO MAP OUR PARTNERSHIPS A SPECIFICALLY FOR COLLEGE ACCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION WHICH SCHOOLS WERE WORKING WITH WHICH PARTNERS AND PUT THOSE ON A MAP. SO WE COULD SEE REALLY BY LOOKING AT THE INTERACTIVE MAP WHICH SCHOOLS PARTNERS AND WHICH SCHOOLS DIDN'T. AND WE'RE CURRENTLY ON THAT AS WELL WITH ALL OF OUR- SERVICES SO WE HAVE TO HAVE WASTED TO. ACCESS THAT INFORMATION SO WE COULD SEE WHERE THE- ARE AND POOL RESOURCES AREAS THAT THEM THE MOST SO THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF A PERSPECTIVE. FROM THE DISTRICTS THAT UP I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT IT. IN JUST MY LAST QUESTION. I KNOW THAT FROM SEE YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE'S A DASHBOARD DATA SO WILL. WILL ALL THE DATA BEEP. BE PUBLICLY FACING WILL WE BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THAT DATA. AT SOME POINT. LAWYERS SURVEY YEAH. YEAH YES AND THE BOTH THE ANSWER THANK YOU CAN SOME CONCRETE BY- B. THE ANSWER JORDAN IS YES TO BOTH BE PUBLIC FACING AND WE LOOK FORWARD BE BY BOXES WE CAN BOB TOGETHER WITH WHAT'S THAT PRESENT ALL OF THE DATA ALL OF OUR TO COULD. GREAT AND THEY THEN- AND THEN THE TIME SINCE WHAT'S- THE WHAT'S THE- HI. I THINK I THINK WOULD BE- ONE THE DESPERATE FROM FROM FROM YEAR- AND- I THINK ABOUT HOW TO GO BACK AND CHECK AND CONFIRM THIS BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE THE OTHER STUFF TO THE WHICH OUT WHICH ALSO OUT OUT WE SHOULD BE RIGHT THIS SUMMER AND SO WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME BACK IN IN AND GIVE THAT TO THIS COMMITTEE IF INVITED- THIS THIS FALL. A VERY MUCH WE SHOULD. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU I HAVE A AND- NUMBER OF. FIVE QUESTIONS HERE THE IMAGE READY ASKED SO I IN CONCERT THERE IS AGREEMENT ON THE NOTION THAT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT SO MUCH OF SUCCESS OF KIDS IS NOT ALWAYS BETWEEN YOU KNOW NINE THREE OR WHATEVER HOURS THAT THE TEACHERS THERE'S SO MUCH ELSE HAPPENING. WITH BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH- YEAH REGULAR HOW SOCIAL IN THE COMMUNITY POP THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TEACHERS ARE ALWAYS THE- SAVIOR. THE FOCUSING ON KIDS SUCCESS SO THE NOTION HERE BRINGING RESOURCES- IS CERTAINLY- A GOOD ONE. SO THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE IS- TENSELY I WHO GETS IT- HOW THEY GONNA GET IT AND HOW DO WE- SUSTAIN ITSELF I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR FINANCING I GUESS WAS ABOUT TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS CALIFORNIA. IS KINDA LOOKED RIGHT HERE ROUGHLY SOMEWHERE CONTINUATION- MAJORITY OR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF COURSE POVERTY SO WHAT'S YOUR ESTIMATE AS FAR AS HOW MANY SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE. A COMMUNITY SCHOOL- THAT TO THEM. PAHLAVAS TEN WITH PERMANENT BINANCE I HAVE THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT I'M HAPPY TO- BUT YOUR ESTIMATE. THANK HALF OF OUR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU LIKE IS THIS GOING TO BE THAT THIS IS THIS THIS COMMUNITY SCHOOL CONCEPT IS GOING TO BE A RARE THING OF JUST A FEW THAT YOU KNOW. LESS THAN HALF OF OUR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA GET THERE'S GONNA BE NO SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW MOST CALIFORNIANS WILL SEE IN OUR LOCAL SCHOOLS. LIVING WITH THAT OF FINANCE SO THIS THIS PROGRAM IS OPTIONAL SO NO SCHOOLS HAVE TO APPLY- I DON'T I'M NOT SURE IF WE CAN STATE THAT ALL SCHOOLS WILL APPLY TO BECOME A COMMUNITY SCHOOL. YEAH IN YOUR GAS IN TWO YEARS FROM NOW HOW MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE. COMMUNITY SCHOOL RESOURCES TO HELP BECOME A COMMUNITY SCHOOL. I THINK IT'S BASED ON WHO APPLIES WE ARE IN YOUR WATER AND WE WERE SEEING. A MESSAGE THERE'S A ROOM. AND EIGHT HUNDRED SCHOOL EIGHTY FOUR OR SO APPLICATIONS REPRESENTING AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED SCHOOLS HAVE APPLIED- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO OFF ON AT THIS POINT- SO IF YOU SEE SO THAT'S LET LESS THAN TEN PERCENT. OF THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S TEN THOUSAND SCHOOLS OR SEVEN HUNDRED SO. WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT. DOUBLE THAT TRIPLE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY IS THIS GOING TO BE AN AMAZING- INVESTMENT FOR JUST HEY YOU KNOW A SLIVER OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS ARE JUST GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW THAN THE NORMAL WE SEE ABOUT SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND POVERTY AREAS. I THINK AS WE MOVE THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION AS OTHER SCHOOLS MODELS IN OUR YOUR ONE- COHORTS- YOU KNOW MORE SCHOOLS MAY BE INCLINED TO APPLY SO WE COULD SEE A RAMP UP- BUT AT THIS TIME I'M NOT SURE WE CAN YOU KNOW ANSWER FOR SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL SCHOOLS WILL APPLY THAT ARE ELIGIBLE. BUT WOULD YOU GUESS THAT THE MAJORITY OF HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS WILL HAVE A COMMUNITY SCHOOL RESOURCES AND WILL APPLY AND GET MONIES OR- IN OVER 50% OF MEN. POVERTY SCHOOLS ARE LESS. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. I'M NOT SURE I CAN. HELP WITH THAT REASONING THREE DOLLARS SO- I THINK WE WANT PROVIDE THE RESOURCES- YOU KNOW TO MEET THE NEED AND I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE KIND OF A CONTINUOUS EVALUATION TO SEE WHAT THAT NEED IS A. OKAY SWANNANOA IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE. AMAZING FOR A FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE THE WINNERS AND THE MAJORITY OF SCHOOLS ARE YOU KNOW. THEY SEE IT AND THE OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS BUT NOT THERE'S- TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT. YEAH AND I THINK WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO APPLY BUT YOU KNOW AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S- NOT NOT A MANDATE. DECEIT CAN YOU HELP US OUT HELP THE PART OF FINANCE OUT HERE AND WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE AND THIS IS FIVE YEAR ON THE FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS. HOW MANY OF OUR- SCHOOLS POVERTY SCHOOL OF HIGH POVERTY SCHOOLS WILL HAVE. A COMMUNITY SCHOOL. ALLOCATION TO HELP BECOME A COMMUNITY SCHOOL IS THIS. SURE UP I'M GONNA BE OBILE YEAH I'M I'M GOING I'M GOING SUGGEST THAT THE IS. IT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. OBNINSK TRIPS. I HAVE- INVEST. ARE AS I SAID MY DISTRICT IN MY INITIATIVES BY HAD. WORKED ON AND LOW WEIGHTS UP IN UP UNTIL THIS POINT. AND- AND SO. I WILL SAY THAT I BELIEVE THAT THESE RE IS WITH PER OR HIGHER DUPLICATE CAL. ON IT IS CERTAINLY OUR INTENT. DOT COM SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING THE GREATEST NEED. WHERE THERE WHERE THERE IS THIS THAT TO BE- OF WHAT WE KNOW THAT THIS WAR WE BELIEVE. I SHOULD SAY THAT THIS MODEL. CAN BE. WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF HIGH NEED SCHOOLS AND IN OUR STATE WILL APPLY. AND WOULD RE- COMMUNITY SCHOOLS- FUNDING TO SUPPORT A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. INITIATIVE THROUGH THIS PROGRAM HIGHS ARE. ON OUR GUYS ARE INTENT AND NOT WILL BE ACROSS. THANK YOU THAT WAS THE ANSWER I WAS LOOKING FOR SO IT WON'T JUST BE. IN A HAPHAZARD THAT A FEW OF OUR HIGH POVERTY 80% THRESHOLD SCHOOLS HAVE COMMUNITY SCHOOL. BENEFITS BUT THE MAJORITY TO SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO THE NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THEY GET. THE ADEQUATE PLANNING GRANTS AND THEY HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND WHERE WITH ALL TO. YOU KNOW. TO BECOME A WINNER SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT. THAT HAPPENS FOR OUR YOU KNOW ROUGHLY PROBABLY. FIVE THOUSAND HIGH POVERTY- SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. SOUPS SO I THINK THAT THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE- THAT THAT WE HAVE THE TODAY- WATCH OUT KIND EIGHT EIGHT DEEP PARTNERSHIP MA- AND IN TURN OF OUR OUTREACH AND- OF OUR ENGAGE INITIAL IN THE MISTER CHAIR. IS THE PERCENTAGE OF SCHOOLS. IN THIS INITIAL ROUND THAT QUALIFY AT OVER EIGHTY PERCENT- AND IT IS AS I AS I NOTED- WORK MORE MORE LOOKING AT AT JUST OVER. THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE ALL THE APPLICATIONS. ARE COMING IN THAT OVER 80% DUPLICATED. WHAT THAT INDICATES TO ME IS THAT WE HAVE INITIAL SIGNS OF SUCCESS. IN TERMS OF THE PROMOTION OF THIS PROGRAM AS IN HOUSE AS AN EQUITY DRIVEN TRANSFORMATION BOB. PATTON DOT OUR PARTNERSHIPS BOTH WITH L. E. AS AND COMMUNICATION BOTH WITH ALL THE EGGS ARE. AN WITH COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS- ON ON THE GROUND IN COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN AFFECTED. WHAT WE SEE SIGNS OF EFFECTIVENESS IN THIS INITIAL ROUTE. WE HAVE TO BE EQUALLY INTO I WILL SEE MORE OPTIONS. AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD- WE'VE WE'VE IN WE'VE SEEN THESE THAT INITIAL INDICATE I. HI BOB YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY A VISIT BY SCHOOLS ON BOARD TO COMMUTE SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT THE LOS ANGELES. ARE I'VE ALSO OUT THE OF VISITING- VERY SUCCESSFUL INITIAL. IN ANAHEIM YOU'RE HIGH DISTRICT- IN ORANGE AND KNOW THAT THERE ARE INCREDIBLE MODELS WRITTEN SPOKE ABOUT. IT. IN HER COMMENTS TO OAKLAND THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WE ARE SEEING POSITIVE FOR. AT SCHOOL SO I WEEKS TO SEE THOSE INITIAL OFTEN POSITIVISTIC SO IT. AROUND WHAT WE ARE GET AN TERM OF OUR INTERVIEW TO UP HOW ARE CHANGE AT SCHOOL SUCKS WEEKS TO SEE. THAT CHANGE CA THROUGH ON ITS OUTCOMES AND SO- YOUR TO THE OF OUR WE MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THE- THAT THE RE GO TO SCHOOLS WERE ARE IN INTENDED AND THAT'S IS THERE I THINK WE TO BUILD ON WHAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE EVEN ONE TOUCH. OKAY- TWO MORE TO MARKET. SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT OF THE SCHOOLS THE HIGH POWER SCHOOLS THAT. THAT SOMEHOW DIDN'T GET THEIR PLANNING GRANT TANNER. WE DIDN'T QUITE HAPPEN FOR THEM. IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED THE RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOL BUT AS YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE BUSY TRYING TO SURVIVE YOU THIS IS THE SAME REASON THEY NEED A COMMUNITY SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED IN SO FOCUS ON HOW ARE WE GOING TO. IS I THINK IT WOULD BE A TOTAL DISASTER AND AN EMBARRASSMENT TELL YOUR FOR CALIFORNIA IF WE HAVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS ARE BACK HERE RIGHT NOW WE WERE ABLE TO GET THIS OUT 220% OF THAT HIGH POVERTY 80% SCHOOLS YOU KNOW WE KNOW THIS IS WHERE I PRIOR PRIORITY. ALLOCATED A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF MONEY LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SO HOW DO WE GO BACK AND DOUBLE DOUBLE DOUBLE BACK WITH THE DISTRICTS WHO WORK IN THIS YOU KNOW ROUND ONE LESS THAN 10% OF APPLIED SO FAR SO HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THE GREATEST NEED ACTUALLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BRING THIS HOME TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND THEIR KIDS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THANK THE QUESTION MISTER CHAIR- I'LL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE HEARING- AND AGAIN THIS IS. AND GO. NOT I WANT TO ON THIS. WE FROM SO JUST AIDS. THAT ARE THAT ARE VERY. VERY INTERESTED THEY- THE CONTENTS BENEFITS OF THE COMMUTER SCHOOLS MODEL. BUT BUT WHAT YOU SAID IS THIS IS JUST OUT. ABSOLUTELY THE CASE- THIS IS BEEN OVERWHELMING YOUR FOR OUR SCHOOLS. THIS IS BEEN WAYS. THE MOST DIFFICULT YEAR. AT WE HAVE. AGAIN BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE SO OF THAT- WE'VE BURKE THAT OUT THAT THEY WERE ALL THE JUST OUT THIS. TO THE THINGS ON OUR ON THEIR PLATE EVEN IT'S COVERED THE PRICE THAT THE IDEA IS THAT THIS. THAT THIS WOULD BE THAT THIS WILL PLACE PLACE SUCH A ROLE AND HAVING SO MANY MORE HANDS HELPING- OUT OF THE SCHOOL SITE. BUT- BUT BUT WHAT IF THAT TEST IS THAT THIS TIME LINE IN YEAR AND THIS. JUST WASN'T FOR THEM BUT THEY INTEND TO ACQUIRE. OBVIOUSLY IT'S OUR JOB TO TURN THE INTENTION INTO APPLICATION INTO. IN TWO THE TYPE OF SUPPORT THAT ACHIEVES TRANSFORMATION. AND SO THAT'S WHERE OUR INTENTION IS AND- MR SURE I AGREE WITH YOU. IF WE IF WE DON'T COME BACK AND REPORT TO THIS COMMITTEE. ABOUT OUR SUCCESS AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN WE CAN CLAIM NOW. THEN THAT WOULD BE DISCUSSED BUT HI I JUST WANT THEM TO OUR WITH THIS. WE HAVE A LARGE AND SEE. ARE PART AT THIS MORTGAGE. ARE COULD BASE PARTNERS AND GREAT L. EA BY I OWE YOU. AND OTHERS. BUT WE WANT THE FACT. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN THE LAST- I READ WHEN WE DID CAN SCHOOL. IN KNOW WHEN WAS IT TO YEARS AGO AND IT WAS BECAUSE- HELP START. AND I SAW ONE IN MY NEIGHBOR HERE AND SO THE TWO MILES FROM APPEARANCE HOW PARK THE IS THAT HI ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS AS HIGH POVERTY. AND THEY HAD A HOW START PROGRAM OUR NAY TO MET AT THE. LITERALLY PORT OF THEY BROUGH IN THE HEALTH START PRO. REMEMBER THE- YOUNG AND PER TO BE HEALTHY COORDINATOR HER NAME SHE'S STILL AROUND AND ABOUT SHE'S YOU KNOW A- IT WAS AMAZING IT BUT NO. THREE YEARS LATER-WHATEVER WAS PULLED THE PLUG IN IT'S NOT THERE THEN. THE TYPE NEEDS ROOM. THE. AND THE FAMILIES THERE YOU KNOW HAVE TEACHERS THAT ARE HARD WORKING THEY DON'T. THAT CONNECTS FOR THE- HEALTH YEAH SCHOOL THAT- EARLY AT CHILD CARE PRE PRE AYPRO IN WHAT THIS WAS A ABOUT FACT WHERE THEY AND THEN IT WAS WAS IT YEAR. YEAH THE LAST TIME MOST YEARS US IS. FIVE YEARS SO THAT WHEN WE'RE ALL GONE INTO YEARS NOW. IS A GONNA BE ANOTHER WE'RE GONNA TRY THIS AGAIN. BECAUSE HAVING THE I MEAN THEY NEWS GOT THREE BILLION DOLLAR. THE BAD NEWS IS IT'S YOU KNOW NOW AN ONGOING THING. SELL I KNOW IT WAS WE HAD LAST YEAR- AMAZING- SURGEON ONE TIME REVENUE. FRANKLY WE HAD TO SPEND IT. AND THIS WAS LIKE HOOKED UP WITH A LIST OF THINGS WERE TO SPEND ONE TIME MONEY AND THIS WAS ALWAYS HIGH ANALYSTS- WITH BUTTER HERE SO IT'S A GOOD THING TO SPEND MONEY ON. BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE. THAT YOU KNOW ALL THIS EFFORTS- MEETS THE TEST OF TIME AND COULD BE CONTINUED. AND SERVE THE KIDS AND THE FAMILIES. IN THESE COMMITTEE SCHOOLS. SO WHO WANTS TO TAKE A AT THAT- I PUBLISHER WITH OF MINE. AND THE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM ALREADY INCORPORATES MANY OF THE STRATEGIES FROM THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE- AND AS MENTIONED WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A COMMUNITY SCHOOLS TO BE ENGAGING IN SUSTAINABILITY AND COORDINATION WORK FROM DAY ONE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE GRANT PERIOD FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A SUCCESSFUL PLAN TO FIFTEEN ONGOING PROGRAMMING SO A WEEK BACK ENTITY SHOULD BE USING GRANT FUNDING TO BUILD THOSE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THAT SUPPORT THE ONGOING WORK AND ALSO TO IDENTIFY AND FREE TO GATHER THE OTHER SOURCES OF ON GOING FUNDING FROM THE STATE SUCH AS THAT YOU LOOK AT EXPANDING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM UNIVERSAL INSTRUCTION TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN STATE PRESCHOOL OR BY DRAWING DOWN FEDERAL FUNDS FROM ELLIE A MEDICAL. BILLING OPTIONS PROGRAM WE ENSURE THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS THAT. THESE ENTITIES STILL HAVE THE TOOLS TO CONTINUE THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WHEN THE WHEN THE ONE TIME MONEY FADES AWAY. YEAH I THINK SO WITH THAT AND- MR VIDMAR HAD MENTIONED THERE IS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL THAT'S PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM THOUGHT COVER COMING SO THEY WILL BE GETTING THE SUPPORT. AND THERE'S ALSO THE FORMATIVE EVALUATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THE QUALIFIED AT THE QUALIFIED ENTITIES THAT ARE SUPPORTING COMMUNITIES. ARE ALSO EVALUATING AND CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING THE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING IMPLEMENTING A SUSTAINABILITY PLAN OR FIGURING OUT HOW TO BRING TOGETHER THESE DIFFERENT SOURCES OF ON GOING FUNDING STREAMS- AND THERE IS NOT FUNDING THAT WE ARE PROPOSING FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND QUALIFIED AND IF YOU FOR COORDINATION. AND SO WE THINK THAT ALL OF THESE- COMPONENTS WILL HELP TO MAKE SURE THAT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WILL BE SUSTAINABLE. YES- MY UNDERSTANDING IN IN PLAIN ENGLISH IS THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE LIKE. A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SCHOOL AND THAT MEANS TO PEOPLE SO IT'S A YOU TO PEEP HOW YOU TO IN THE ARE WORKING AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER HERE- LAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CREDIT RIGHT A MILE FROM RESOURCE FROM COUNTY FEDERAL FOR HEALTH CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH MEDIC HOW YOU KNOW AFTER SCHOOL LIKE DRAW IN SEE LIKE- YOU KNOW A CONVENER MAVEN TO G. LIKE HELP MAKE SURE YOU'RE COORDINATING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE SCHOOL I WANT TO DO THAT STUFF BUT THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON. TEACHNG CLASSROOMS. DEALING WITH YOU KNOW COUNTING THAT THAT'S NOT THEY DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING SO IN FIVE YEARS YOU BRING AND ALL THIS STUFF. AND THEN THIS MONEY GOES AWAY AND YOU TWO ARE THERE THAT. SCHOOL SITE ANYMORE. AND THEN. THAT THE EVERYTHING KIND OF YOU KNOW. MAYBE FADES AWAY SO HOW DO WE- IN THE SIDE I GET A YOU'RE SAYING THAT TACKLE THAT'S WHY TIME BUT AFTER THAT STAFFING OF THE POSITIONS EXPIRES. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH HEALTHY START YEAR AFTER LISTER BUT LAUGHED IT WAS STILL THERE. BARELY TWO YEARS KIND OF THREE YEARS FOUR YEARS IT AS ALL GONE SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE. THAT THE LIKE YOU KNOW. AT THAT SOMEONE WHO'S WHO'S CARING FOR A GARDEN AFTER A WHILE SO IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE. IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME. YEAH I THINK THE GOAL IS TO- ESTABLISHED IN FIFTY TWO INSTITUTIONALIZE THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL OF PROGRAMMING IN THE SCHOOL ALSO UTILIZING OTHER SOURCES OF ON GOING FUNDING- TO KEEP THE COORDINATE. AROUND OR POTENTIALLY TRAIN- AND A STAFF MEMBER THAT'S ALREADY THERE TO CONTINUE THOSE SERVICES AND THAT'S THAT YEAH THAT WOULD BE THAT- INTENT OF- AT THE FUNDING FOR THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS CRACK AND TO SUPPORT THE ONGOING FIFTEEN OF THE PROGRAM OKAY THANK YOU FINAL QUESTION.
