REMEMBER WHEN YOU AND I HAVE

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:23.948
TRAVELED TOGETHER AND WE WERE

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:26.517
DEALING WITH- PRIVACY MATTERS-

00:31:26.584 --> 00:31:28.186
THE AMERICAN SYSTEM THAT WAS

00:31:28.253 --> 00:31:29.420
EMERGING AND THEN FOR THE

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:31.055
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS EMERGING.

00:31:31.122 --> 00:31:32.223
IN THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM THAT WAS

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.725
EMERGING IN ALL THE ISSUES THAT

00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:35.093
WE'VE DEALT WITH IN THE PAST

00:31:35.159 --> 00:31:37.362
COUPLE YEARS IN THIS COMMITTEE.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:38.896
IT'S A TOUGH ISSUE. IT'S A VERY

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.665
IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND SO I THINK

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.867
BRINGING THIS ISSUE UP I THINK

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:45.270
IT'S HELPFUL. FOR US TO- TAKE A

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:47.405
STAB AT THE NEW DIMENSIONS OF

00:31:47.472 --> 00:31:49.173
TECHNOLOGY. AND THE CONCERNS

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.677
THAT WE HAVE ABOUT. HOW DATA.

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:53.344
IS USED HOW ARE PRIVATE

00:31:53.411 --> 00:31:55.947
INFORMATION. IS COMMODITIZED

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:58.416
AND- PUT INTO THE MARKET- FOR

00:31:58.483 --> 00:31:59.584
OTHER PEOPLE TO BENEFIT FROM I

00:31:59.651 --> 00:32:00.985
THINK THAT IS BUT THIS IS A

00:32:01.052 --> 00:32:08.326
CONCERN OF MINE- SO THIS BILL.

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.761
CREATES A PROVISION FOR HAS A

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:10.762
PROVISION THAT CREATES AN

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:13.731
OBLIGATION TO DISCLOSE TO THE

00:32:13.798 --> 00:32:16.467
DRIVER THAT HE OR SHE IS BEING

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:19.971
RECORDED- AND THEN YOU CAN JUST

00:32:20.038 --> 00:32:21.139
DOCTOR HAD THAT THAT IS

00:32:21.205 --> 00:32:23.941
CORRECT. WHAT THREE CHURCHES

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:26.744
DISCLOSED THAT THE CAMERA EXIST

00:32:26.811 --> 00:32:30.148
IN THE IN THE- THE CAR- IT SO

00:32:30.214 --> 00:32:31.516
IT'S NOT EVERY TIME YOU GET IN

00:32:31.582 --> 00:32:33.885
THE CAR IT SAYS YOUR CAMERAS

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:35.086
NOW BEEN ACTIVATED ALREADY

00:32:35.153 --> 00:32:36.354
RIGHT USUALLY WHEN ONE LINE

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:38.690
SHUTS ONLY ONCE RIGHT OKAY SO

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.825
HERE'S MY CONCERN- I LIKE THE

00:32:40.892 --> 00:32:45.596
IDEA THAT AS A CONSUMER. I AM.

00:32:45.663 --> 00:32:49.267
THAT SAYS SOMETHING. TESTING

00:32:49.334 --> 00:33:00.078
TESTING PER. BUT. THE MALES

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:03.514
STEP AWAY FROM IT.

00:33:03.581 --> 00:33:04.649
UNFORTUNATELY CENTER BOARDS I

00:33:04.716 --> 00:33:06.017
THINK YOU HAVE TO BE ON THE

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.485
MICROPHONE YEAH BUT ITS

00:33:10.154 --> 00:33:11.055
IS THAT BETTER OKAY THAT'S

00:33:11.122 --> 00:33:15.259
BETTER NOW. ARE- MY CONCERN IS

00:33:15.326 --> 00:33:17.562
THAT. THE RECORDING OF

00:33:17.628 --> 00:33:19.664
INFORMATION I LIKE THE IDEA

00:33:19.731 --> 00:33:21.599
THAT YOU WERE DISALLOWING ITS

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.334
USAGE AND PURCHASE BY THIRD

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:25.069
PARTIES I THINK THAT IS VERY

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:26.871
IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK INTO. THE

00:33:26.938 --> 00:33:29.407
AGE OF A. I. AND CONSUMER

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:30.742
BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS

00:33:30.808 --> 00:33:31.876
INDIVIDUALIZED BEHAVIOR THESE

00:33:31.943 --> 00:33:33.211
ARE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT

00:33:33.277 --> 00:33:35.480
WE NEED TO PROTECT. YOUR UTMOST

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:36.981
REASONABLY GIVEN THE MARKET

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:38.216
DEMANDS AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE

00:33:38.282 --> 00:33:40.485
MOVING FORWARD. WHAT I AM

00:33:40.551 --> 00:33:43.921
CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS. THAT

00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:46.157
THIS WOULD BE- DISCOVERABLE

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:48.793
INFORMATION. OUR MEANING THAT

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.895
IF THERE WERE ANY FENDER BENDER.

00:33:50.962 --> 00:33:53.631
OR ANY ISSUE ON WHETHER OR NOT

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:56.467
THERE WAS- A DISTRACTION OR

00:33:56.534 --> 00:33:58.603
INATTENTIVENESS BY DRIVERS THAT

00:33:58.669 --> 00:34:01.005
THE DEFAULT POSITION OF EITHER

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:02.306
A PLAINTIFF WORN INSURANCE

SEE THE RECORDED INFORMATION. I

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:08.079
DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:34:08.146 --> 00:34:11.382
BILL. IS DESIGNED TO DO BUT IT

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.317
COULD CREATE A BY PRODUCT THAT

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:16.788
THIS TECHNOLOGY ARE WOULD ALLOW

00:34:16.854 --> 00:34:17.388
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:21.893
IS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH- NOT

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:24.028
ALLOWING THIS INFORMATION TO BE

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:26.097

THROUGH THE PROCESS OF FINDING

00:34:32.637 --> 00:34:33.538
A WAY TO INCORPORATE A

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:35.606
PROVISION THAT THIS INFORMATION

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.509
IS NOT DISCOVERABLE IN A CIVIL

00:34:38.576 --> 00:34:40.611
CON CONTEXT. SO THAT WAS MY

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:42.246

KOWSKI I MEAN I'M GOING TO HAVE

00:34:46.317 --> 00:34:47.885
TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU

00:34:47.952 --> 00:34:50.855

ACTIVITY I DON'T KNOW- I HAVE

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.636
TO THINK THROUGH WHETHER THE

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:07.572
DRIVER. KNOWING THAT THERE'S A

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:08.606

BOUGHT THE CAR THERE THEY

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:11.275
AGREED THAT THAT THAT THAT

00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.143
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THEY

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:14.378
CAN KEEP OUT FROM THIS

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.380

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.292
SOME SERIOUS UNINTENDED.

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:29.594
CONSEQUENCES BY THESE

THIS TALK TECHNOLOGY WAS

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.686
AVAILABLE AND THAT IT HAD THE

00:35:55.753 --> 00:35:56.654
POTENTIAL TO END UP IN A

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:58.022
VEHICLE THAT I MIGHT PURCHASE

00:35:58.089 --> 00:35:59.957

OUT WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THE ACT

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.062
AND STILL TODAY DOESN'T KNOW

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:11.862
WHAT THE PURPOSE OF THAT

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:12.930
CAMERAS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.332
SERVE ANY FUNCTION IN HIS CAR

00:37:14.398 --> 00:37:17.168
THAT HE KNOWS OF- SO I DO THINK

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:21.105
WE NEED TO. LOOK AT THIS THE

00:37:21.172 --> 00:37:22.039
PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THE BILL AS

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.975
IT'S WRITTEN IS PUTTING THE

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.242
RESPONSIBILITY ON THE

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:28.846
DEALERSHIPS WE HAVE PUT SO MANY

00:37:28.913 --> 00:37:30.548
DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE

00:37:30.615 --> 00:37:33.918
DEALERSHIPS- IN CALIFORNIA- AND

00:37:33.985 --> 00:37:36.253
IF THIS WAS A ONE A PROFIT BASE

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.254
FOR THE DEALERSHIP I COULD SEE

00:37:37.321 --> 00:37:39.156
THE NEXUS OF PUTTING IT ON THEM

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:40.324
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE

00:37:40.391 --> 00:37:42.259
DEALERS HAVE ACCESS. TO THE

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:44.061
DATA THAT'S BEING SHOULD COULD

00:37:44.128 --> 00:37:48.766
BE SHARED. OR BE SOLD. SO I

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:49.800
THINK THAT PUT IT ON THE- ON

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.268
DEALERSHIP. I JUST GO THERE

00:37:51.335 --> 00:37:54.005

ST REDDING WHAT THE- NEW CAR

I'M- I LIKE THE IDEA. I'M

00:38:04.181 --> 00:38:06.050
OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT'S

00:38:06.117 --> 00:38:07.618

THERE'S ANOTHER SOLUTION. I'M
