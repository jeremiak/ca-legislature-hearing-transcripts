ONLY THE PEOPLE OF THE WAIT SO

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:22.848
LONG BUT THAT ACTUALLY THEY

00:16:22.915 --> 00:16:23.816
WERE THAT MANY PEOPLE TO

00:16:23.882 --> 00:16:25.651

NINE BILLS- SUBMITTED. OVER TWO

00:18:57.569 --> 00:18:58.136
HUNDRED OF THOSE ARE SPOT BILLS

00:18:58.203 --> 00:19:00.472
WHICH MEANS MORE INFORMATION

00:19:00.539 --> 00:19:01.740
NEEDS TO BE PROVIDED BEFORE

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.509
THEY ARE SET FOR HEARING AT

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:06.578
COMMITTEES. LAST YEAR MEMBERS

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.980
IN THE SENATE AND I WANT TO

00:19:08.046 --> 00:19:09.748
AGAIN THANK YOU REDUCE THEIR

00:19:09.815 --> 00:19:11.984
BILL LOAD SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.452
OF THE SITUATION THAT WE WERE

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:15.120
IN WITH THE PANDEMIC AND THE

00:19:15.187 --> 00:19:17.523
UNCERTAINTY. THIS YEAR WE HAVE

00:19:17.589 --> 00:19:19.525
SOME MORE CERTAINTY BUT WE ALSO

00:19:19.591 --> 00:19:20.993
HAVE THE ABILITY TO SCHEDULE

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.294
THINGS APPROPRIATELY SO THAT

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:25.097
PEOPLE WILL BE SAFE PROTECTED

00:19:25.163 --> 00:19:27.132
AND WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW PUBLIC

00:19:27.199 --> 00:19:29.601
PARTICIPATION. I THINK ONE OF

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.837
THE BENEFITS OF OUR DECISION AS

00:19:31.904 --> 00:19:33.405
A SENATE BODY TO ALLOW REMOTE

00:19:33.472 --> 00:19:34.773
PARTICIPATION AS SOON AS

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.576
POSSIBLE. WAS TO ENSURE THAT

00:19:37.643 --> 00:19:39.378
MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:40.946
PEOPLE THAT DON'T USUALLY GET

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:42.080
TO COME UP HERE HAVE THE

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.550
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN- AND AT

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.018
LEAST SAY THEIR NAME WHERE THEY

00:19:46.084 --> 00:19:48.320
RESIDE AND THAT THEY AGREE OR

00:19:48.387 --> 00:19:51.023
DISAGREE. AND I THINK THAT HAS

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:52.057
BEEN SOMETHING I HOPE WE FIND A

00:19:52.124 --> 00:19:53.859
WAY TO CONTINUE BEYOND THIS

00:19:53.926 --> 00:19:55.928
PANDEMIC TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF

00:19:55.994 --> 00:19:56.962
MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC

00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:58.664
SO. I THINK THIS IS A

CONCERNED THAT THERE COULD BE.

01:28:13.821 --> 01:28:15.156
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD HERE

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:17.592

MAYBE BECAUSE I DON'T

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:29.671
UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS THAT'S

01:28:29.737 --> 01:28:30.271
WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:28:30.338 --> 01:28:33.374
IS ACTUALLY HOW IT WORKS- WELL

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.710
I WILL DO MY BEST RIGHT NOW TO

IS EASIER TO DO VERIFICATIONS

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:16.484

01:36:20.241 --> 01:36:23.844
CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:26.380
PRESIDENT- I DO RISE IN SUPPORT

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:27.848
OF THIS BILL BUT I DO WANT TO

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:29.550
MAKE- THE COMMENT THAT I

01:36:29.617 --> 01:36:31.752
BELIEVE THIS IS JUST EIGHTY

01:36:31.819 --> 01:36:34.955
INTENSE. A CRIME OFF THE TABLE

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.390
WHAT ARE RESTAURANTS IN OUR

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.359
SALONS HAVE SUFFERED- OVER THE

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:42.429
LAST YEAR. I HAVE A STYLIST.

01:36:42.496 --> 01:36:44.732
PART OF ME. SORRY SYSTEM

01:36:44.798 --> 01:36:47.434
MOTIONING TO FILL IF WE COULD

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:48.035
RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE A LITTLE

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:50.671
BECAUSE YOU'RE HARD TO HEAR. I

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.473
HAVE A STYLIST SHE'S A SINGLE

01:36:52.540 --> 01:36:54.742
MOM AND HAS TWO KIDS. SHE LOST

01:36:54.808 --> 01:36:56.510
OVER TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.045
AND BECAUSE SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED

01:36:58.112 --> 01:36:59.513
TO OPERATE BECAUSE OF THE

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.681
SHUTDOWN IN THE STATE OF

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.449
CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE HOME

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.318
ORDER THAT THE GOVERNOR ISSUED.

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.053
I'M SURE SHE APPRECIATES HER

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:06.954
FIFTY DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THIS

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:08.155
BILL THAT SHE WOULD GET BACK

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:10.024
OVER A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. BUT

01:37:10.090 --> 01:37:11.625
AGAIN THAT IS SO MINIMAL

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.460
COMPARED TO WHAT WAS LOST. THE

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:15.462
SALON OWNER IN WHICH MY STYLIST

01:37:15.529 --> 01:37:17.598
WORKS OUT. HER PERSONAL INCOME

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.967
WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST SEVENTY

01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:20.701
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.536
APOLOGIZE FOR BUSINESS INCOME

01:37:22.603 --> 01:37:24.371
WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST SEVENTY

01:37:24.438 --> 01:37:25.339
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BEING

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:27.241
THE SALON OWNER IN OUR PERSONAL

01:37:27.308 --> 01:37:30.010
INCOME WAS REDUCED BY ALMOST

01:37:30.077 --> 01:37:31.512
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS IS

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:33.147
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:35.749
FOR MOSTLY AND WOMEN AND MOST

01:37:35.816 --> 01:37:37.551
SINGLE WOMEN I NOTICE IT ALMOST

01:37:37.618 --> 01:37:38.519
IN THE SALON THAT I GO TO

01:37:38.586 --> 01:37:39.753
ALMOST EVERY PERSON IN THERE IS

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:41.956
A SINGLE MOM. AND I THINK ABOUT

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:43.157
THE MONEY THAT THEY LOST AND

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:44.124
LIKE I SAID I'M SURE THEY

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:47.261
APPRECIATE THIS FIFTY DOLLARS-THAT WILL GO. TOWARDS THEIR

01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:49.129
LICENSE FEE FOR THE NEXT- OF

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:51.131
RETROACTIVELY FOR TWO YEARS.

01:37:51.198 --> 01:37:51.899
BUT I THINK SOMETHING

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.133
DESPERATELY NEEDS TO BE DONE

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:54.602
ABOUT THE REVENUE AND A LOSS

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:56.604
BECAUSE THIS WAS A TAKING. THIS

01:37:56.670 --> 01:37:57.738
IS A TAKING BY GOVERNMENT

01:37:57.805 --> 01:38:01.108
WITHOUT COMPENSATION THEY WERE

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:01.942
NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE. I

01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:03.143
CALLED A COUPLE OF RESTAURANT

01:38:03.210 --> 01:38:05.045
AND BAR OWNERS THAT HAVE IN THE

01:38:05.112 --> 01:38:07.214
DISTRICT. AND I TALKED TO ONE

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:09.250
AND HE SAYS THAT HE LOST OVER

01:38:09.316 --> 01:38:09.850
SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:11.452
IN THE TOTAL TIME FRAME-

01:38:11.518 --> 01:38:14.154
ALCOHOL SALES IN RESTAURANTS. A

01:38:14.221 --> 01:38:16.590
FOOD AND BEVERAGE. SO THAT

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:18.392
MONEY WAS LOST SO AGAIN I'M

01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.660
SURE HE'S GOING TO PROCEED HIS

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.262
UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:38:21.328 --> 01:38:22.229
CREDIT THAT HE WOULD GET FROM

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:24.198
ABC. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT

01:38:24.265 --> 01:38:25.933
IT'S ANYWHERE SIGNIFICANT TO

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.868
WHAT WAS LOST AND WE HAVE. WE

01:38:27.935 --> 01:38:29.336
HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OR

01:38:29.403 --> 01:38:30.471
THERE'S NO DOUBT OF THAT I'VE

01:38:30.537 --> 01:38:31.438
BEEN ABLE TO SEE ABOUT THE

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:33.507
SIGNIFICANT LOSS THAT ARE SMALL

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:34.441
BUSINESS OWNERS AND RESTAURANT

01:38:34.508 --> 01:38:36.477
OWNERS- IN OUR SALON OWNERS

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:38.212
HAVE LOST OR SALON STYLISTS

01:38:38.279 --> 01:38:40.414
HAVE LOST DURING THIS PANDEMIC.

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:41.715
I KNOW THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:44.184
APPLY FOR P. P. P. LOANS AND

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:46.086
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:48.022
JUST TO HAVE THEIR ABILITY NOT

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.790
TO MAKE MONEY AND NOT TO EMPLOY

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.925
THE ALMOST TWO MILLION IF NOT

01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:54.061
MORE. RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES AND

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:57.131
FOOD SERVICE WORKERS IN OUR

01:38:57.197 --> 01:38:59.533
COMMUNITIES. IT'S JUST. SO SAD.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.068
AND SO WHILE I HAVE SUPPORT

01:39:01.135 --> 01:39:02.936
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:05.306
THINK IT'S A VERY MODEST STEP.

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:07.608
TO IT'S A VERY MODEST STEP. TO

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:09.009
HELP SOME OF OUR RESTAURANT

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:11.679
OWNERS IT'S BY FAR DOES NOT GO

01:39:11.745 --> 01:39:13.614
AND NEARLY FAR ENOUGH THANK

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:15.282

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:32.299
OF THAT- THIS UP THIS

01:39:32.366 --> 01:39:34.201
PARTICULAR BILL IS ONLY ONE OF

01:39:34.268 --> 01:39:36.437
A SERIES OF BILLS- THAT- WE ARE

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:38.172
DOING TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR

01:39:38.238 --> 01:39:40.874
SMALL BUSINESSES- AND CERTAINLY

01:39:40.941 --> 01:39:42.710
NOT THE LARGEST OF THEM ALL

01:39:42.776 --> 01:39:44.978
BUT- I DO APPRECIATE THAT- WE

01:39:45.045 --> 01:39:45.612
ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:47.047

01:39:52.453 --> 01:39:54.555
LICENSES THAT- BY THE WAY WE DO

01:39:54.621 --> 01:39:56.390
NEED WE DO USE THAT REVENUE TO

01:39:56.457 --> 01:39:58.225

ABLE TO OPERATE THAT PERHAPS

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:05.666
IT'S NOT FAIR THAT WE CONTINUE

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:06.867
TO BURDEN THEM WITH THIS

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:08.635
EXPENSES EVEN IF THEY ARE SMALL

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.371

MEASURE TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:53.967
OTHERS NO DOUBT WE ALL KNOW THE

GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS USUAL

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:17.390
AND OVERLOOKED SMALL BUSINESSES

01:53:17.457 --> 01:53:19.225
AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES

01:53:19.292 --> 01:53:22.896
WHAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED

01:53:22.962 --> 01:53:24.697
IS WHAT MINORITIES. HAVE KNOWN

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:26.499
HISTORICALLY. THAT MINORITY

01:53:26.566 --> 01:53:27.367
OWNED AND WOMEN OWNED

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.902
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DENIED

01:53:28.968 --> 01:53:31.070
ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND OTHER

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:32.539
PROGRAMS THAT OTHER BUSINESSES

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:34.607
TAKE FOR GRANTED. THE SAME

01:53:34.674 --> 01:53:36.075
CAPITALIN PROGRAMS THAT THEY

USE TO SURVIVE AND GROW THEIR

01:53:37.710 --> 01:53:41.080
BUSINESS. AND THIS IS STILL THE

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:42.649
CASE TODAY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:44.751
MINORITIES BEING ABLE TO ACCESS

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:47.820

THEIR BUSINESSES BEFORE THIS

01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:52.258
PANDEMIC A STANFORD STUDY FOUND

01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:55.328
THAT 1% OF MINORITY BUSINESS

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:57.397

01:53:57.463 --> 01:53:59.499
YEAR COMPARED TO OVER 7% WHITE

01:53:59.566 --> 01:54:01.901
OWNED BUSINESSES. THIS SPREAD

01:54:01.968 --> 01:54:02.669
THEM BECAUSE ALL THE ONLY

01:54:02.735 --> 01:54:04.771
EXACERBATED THAT PROBLEM THAT

01:54:04.837 --> 01:54:07.106
HAS EXISTED FOR YEARS LAST YEAR

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:09.209
FEDERAL RESERVE FOUND THAT 70%

01:54:09.275 --> 01:54:11.511
OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WERE

01:54:11.578 --> 01:54:13.546
TIGHTENING THEIR LENDING

01:54:13.613 --> 01:54:15.548
STANDARDS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:54:15.615 --> 01:54:17.050
THAT IS WHY THIS LEGISLATION IS

01:54:17.116 --> 01:54:18.718
SO ESSENTIAL AT THIS TIME AND

01:54:18.785 --> 01:54:21.187
WHY URGE MY COLLEAGUES TO

01:54:21.254 --> 01:54:23.690

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.091
MORE THAN WHAT IS DONE TODAY

01:54:25.158 --> 01:54:26.726
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP AND

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:29.062
WHAT IS SO CRITICALLY NEEDED TO

01:54:29.128 --> 01:54:31.064
KEEP THESE BUSINESSES AFLOAT.

01:54:31.130 --> 01:54:32.398
IF WE ARE TO LEARN FROM THE

01:54:32.465 --> 01:54:34.434
MISTAKES OF THE GREAT RECESSION

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:36.236
WE MUST GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:54:36.302 --> 01:54:39.005
TO RESEARCH THEY NEED TO GROW.

01:54:39.072 --> 01:54:41.040
OUT OF THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

01:54:41.107 --> 01:54:42.909
WE CAN'T GO BACK TO BUSINESS AS

01:54:42.976 --> 01:54:44.811
USUAL PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC.

01:54:44.877 --> 01:54:46.045
FOR MINORITY AND WOMEN OWNED

01:54:46.112 --> 01:54:47.547
