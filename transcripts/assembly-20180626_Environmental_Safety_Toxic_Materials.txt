ARTS CENTER JACKSON -- I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS BILL. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE EARLY BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMITTEE CHAIR. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND PLEASE PROCEED AND MISTER FAMILY MEMBER TING THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS WELL. WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE -- THE THE ABILITY TO PRESENT THIS SITE IN A SPECIAL ORDER -- THIS IS A OF MEASURE THAT I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS IT'S A BILL THAT CREATES A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE. PRODUCER PAID TAKE BACK PROGRAM FOR HOME GENERATED PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS AND MEDICAL SHARPS. THIS BILL WOULD SAID A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. UNDER WHICH CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS WOULD BE ABLE TO SAFELY AND CONVENIENTLY DISPOSE OF MEDICAL WASTE AN UNUSED MEDICAL PRODUCTS. GIVING SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THAT VIRTUALLY ALL CALIFORNIANS KNOW TOO WELL. EACH AND EVERYONE OF US WHEN WE HAD CERTAIN HEALTH ISSUES OR LOVED ONES HAVE HAD THEM. WERE ALL PRESCRIBED ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF MEDICATION OR AT LEAST SOME MEDICATION WE DON'T NECESSARILY TAKE IT ALL. AND AT SOME POINT THAT THE ACCUMULATES IN OUR MEDICINE CABINETS AND WE LOOK AT AND WONDER WHAT IS THAT FOR WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE FLUSHING THESE PRODUCTS DOWN THE TOILET WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM PUTTING THEM. ARE IN OUR OUR WATER SUPPLY AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THEM OUT THERE IN THE WORLD SO THE CHILDREN OR ADULTS ARE CONFUSED BY THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE THERE. AND TAKE THEM WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE A ADMITTED TO OUR HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY SENIORS FOR CONFUSING MEDICATIONS. WE KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE FOR REASONS THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY BEYOND ME WILL TAKE OF THEIR OF MEDICATIONS PRESCRIPTIONS AT THAT THEIR PARENTS HAVE IN THERE. OF MEDICINE CABINETS AND TAKE THEM TO PARTIES WHICH THEY THEN WILL THROW INTO A FISH BOWL AND POPPED SOME DECIDED TO SEE WHATEVER IT IS THE BIG KICK FROM WHATEVER MOM WAS TAKING FOR WHATEVER. A A IT THERE'S JUST TOO MANY OF THOSE AND OF COURSE ALL LET. AND DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING WHO'S BEEN WORKING ON THE SHARPS ELEMENT OF THIS TO PERHAPS SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS I PERSONALLY HAVE HAD THAT EXPERIENCE IS A CANCER SURVIVOR I WAS TAKING ALL SORTS OF MEDICATIONS OR AT LEAST THEY WERE PRESCRIBED TO ME FOR WHATEVER THIS. WAS THAT I WAS DOING OF THAT WAS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. AT THE END OF THE DAY THANKFULLY IT WAS AWHILE AGO A LONG TIME AGO. I LOOKED AT MY MEDICINE CABINET I HAD NO. WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TAKEN THEM FOR AND THE QUESTION WAS NOW WITH TWO I DO WITH THEM? AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT I THINK MOST OF US HAVE EITHER FOR OURSELVES OR FOOD CARED FOR OUR PARENTS OR ELDAR ELDERLY. THERE'S JUST WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO OR THE A THAT WHAT IS REQUIRED TO REMOVE REMOVE FEES OF MEDICATIONS AND DANGEROUS PRODUCTS -- FROM OUR HOME SO -- YEAH I HAVE WORKED ON THIS -- AS I MENTIONED FOR MANY YEARS AS A RESULT OF MY OWN EXPERIENCE AND JUST RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS. WHEN THESE ARE ITEMS ARE NOT DISPOSED OF SAFELY? THE WASTE IS SUBJECT TO ABUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM OUR WATER COME DISTRICTS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL DUMP THESE DOWN THE TOILET THEY INFEST OUR WATER SYSTEMS THEY ALSO CLOG THE DRAINS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T ALL NECESSARILY -- DISINTEGRATE SO THE HARM TO SOCIETY IS NOT JUST THE PERSONAL OR CHOSE TO PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE IMPROPERLY DISCARDED MEDICAL WASTE SORT OF SERIOUS CONCERN TO PUBLIC SAFETY AND TO THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL YOU FIND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT HAVE TO DEAL WITH DISCARDED MEDICAL WASTE AT GREAT COST TO THEIR RESOURCES. THEY PAY FOR THESE ARE A SHERATON AND PUBLIC SAFETY PEOPLE WHO PROVIDE THESE BINS AND DO THESE TAKE BACK PROGRAMS. THE TAXPAYER MONEY THAT IS USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THESE IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF WAYS ARE SCORCHED THE PUBLIC PLACES AGAIN WITH THE SHARP STUTTER -- ON THE STREETS AND I CAN TELL YOU IN OUR BEACHES WHERE OUR KIDS WANTED GO TO RECREATION THERE'S A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE THERE THAT'S EXPOSED HER CHEST BENEATH THE SAND THAT IS A DANGER TO THEM -- WE WE HAVE. TO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM. SO -- AGAIN OR LANDFILLS THE AQUATIC SYSTEMS LIKE THAT GOES ON BUT THE SITUATION IS NOT ALL THAT GRAHAM. BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO AND WE CAN ADDRESS THIS IN A BETTER WAY. AND THANKS TO LOCAL EFFORTS ACROSS SEVERAL CALIFORNIA COUNTIES AND STATEWIDE IN PROVINCIAL. OF PROGRAMS IN WASHINGTON STATE AND SOON TO BE IN NEW YORK STATE WE TRIED AND GOT TESTED MODELS THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN COOPERATION AND WITH THE PARTNER KEL PHARMACEUTICAL AND MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRIES WE ARE ACTUALLY EVERYONE'S AT THE TABLE AND WE ARE. A DISCUSSING THE ISSUE WE HAVE A BILL BEFORE YOU THAT WE RECOGNIZE I'D NEED SOME OF CONTINUED WORKING WERE ALL COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND HAVING IN TALKING WITH THE CHAIR. RECOGNIZING HIS INTEREST IN HELPING WHICH IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. ARDEN AND WE TALK ABOUT LOCAL EFFORTS I SHOULD NOTE THAT JUST THIS VERY MORNING. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES UNANIMOUSLY PASSED A RESOLUTION SUPPORTING THIS BILL IN CONCEPT HIGHLIGHTING THE CONTINUED EFFORT. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO GET THIS DONE AND THE INTEREST ON THE PART OF THE COUNTY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM COMPREHENSIVELY. IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO THAT HERE FIRST AND THAT'S THE GOAL RATHER THAN HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WITH DIFFERENT STANDARDS AND DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. A THIS IS A STATEWIDE EFFORT THIS MEASURE IS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A PROGRAM THAT IS COMPREHENSIVE YET COMP A COMPREHENSIBLE TO ALL OF THE PARTIES INVOLVED. ANDA AGAIN MANY YEARS OF CONVERSATION A WE ARE HERE AND IT ADDITION -- I HAVE MY ONE OF MY CO AUTHORS WITH ME TODAY -- WE ALSO HAVE JASON SMELSER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS THAT MAY EXIST.

BILL INTRODUCTION REPORTS ARE VIEWED AS A LOBBYIST IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I REMEMBER ASKING MYSELF WHAT IS A SHARP AND WHY AM I READING ABOUT THIS. I DON'T KNOW. AB WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AT LEAST THAT LONG IF NOT LONGER -- SO WHY IS A PROGRAM NEED IT UP ON THE DRUG SIDE VERY SIMPLE -- ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION IS ONE ISSUE. OTHERS THE PRESENCE OF UP A PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS IN THE NATION'S WATERWAYS -- COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF EXCRETION -- UNDER THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY AND THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN THE U. S. EP EPA ALL RELEASED. A DRUG DISPOSAL GUIDELINES ARE BECAUSE AND I QUOTE I IMPROPER DRUG DISPOSAL OF THE PRESCRIPTION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL CONCERN.

SO WE WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT AFTER TWELVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. WE KNOW THESE PROGRAMS WORK THEY'RE VERY POPULAR WITH THE PUBLIC THE VERY POPULAR WITH THE PHARMACIES. THEY'RE VERY INEXPENSIVE. SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE OCCASIONALLY HEAR ABOUT THINGS THAT MICHAEL WRONG WE CAN ASSURE YOU THAT AFTER TWELVE YEARS THEY HAVE NOT WE HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS. AS FAR AS POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE BILL. AS I MENTIONED EVERY PHARMACY IN OUR COUNTY PARTICIPATES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONVENIENCE STANDARD IN THE EXISTING BILL IS THE STARTING POINT. THESE PROGRAMS WORK BETTER THE MORE PHARMACIES YOU HAVE AND IDEALLY IF EVERYBODY IS AN SECONDLY -- BECAUSE THEY ARE EXISTING VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS WE URGE YOU NOT TO INCLUDE ANY PREEMPTION IN THE BILL WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MISTER PHILLY PAY FOR WENT AS SAKE YOU CHAIRMAN QUIRK. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE A SLEEPY POINT IS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND MANUFACTURERS OF AMERICA -- IT WOULD. A LOT OF THIS WORK HAS BEEN INFORMED OF BY THE RECENT STATE AUDIT THAT INDICATED THAT A ALMOST 90% OF CALIFORNIANS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF COLLECTION SITES UP BUT ANOTHER THING THAT THE AUDIT INFORMED US IS THAT THERE ISN'T A CENTRALIZED UNIFIED. A PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE COLLECTION SITES. ACTUALLY WORKED THE ABSOLUTE BENEFIT OF CONSUMERS AND FOR THOSE REASONS FARM UP AS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION -- WITH YOUR STAFF A OBVIOUSLY SENATOR JACKSON ASSEMBLYMEMBERS TANG AND GRAY AND FOR THAT WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO VOICE OUR CONCERNS. TO THE POINT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER ABOUT HOW THIS BILL IS NOT -- FINALIZES AS RECENT AS THIS MORNING AS A MATTER OF EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD SOME ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOUR COMMITTEE AND AND THE STAFF. A AS HOW IT RELATES TO CONFIDENTIALITY BUT AS I'M REMINDED OF BY MY EXPERIENCE HERE IN THE BUILDING THAT'S WHAT THE SUMMERS -- FOR INTO WILL KEEP WORKING EARNESTLY WITH. THAT -- MOVES A BILL HERE THAT THAT MEETS YOUR EXPECTATIONS BUT FOR THE MOMENT OF FORMA FINDS ITSELF NEUTRAL BUT A VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS BY. A EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS CURRENT [inaudible] AMISH NEITHER. JENNIFER SITE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CHAIN DRUG STORES AYE WE ARE BOTH IN THE CATEGORY OF DRUGS AND SHARPS AND SO I THOUGHT I'D COME UP NOW IN AND AT LEAST EXPRESSED SOME OF OUR CONCERNS. YET WE ARE AND SUPPORTS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND SO OUR PHARMACIES VERY MUCH WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION -- AND WE ARE VERY VERY INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND THIS BILL AND WE ARE. VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE AUTHOR SPONSORS AND I'M THE COMMITTEE IN MOVING THIS FORWARD AND WANT TO BE ACTED PRETTY DEFENSE -- IN IN A PROGRAM HERE IN THE STATE LET ME FIRST PREFACE THAT I'M UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT IN TIME WHERE OPPOSE MUST AMENDED ON THE BILL AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE FEEL THE BILL NEED TO BE CLARIFIED WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR DIRECTION. ON HOW THE BILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED. JUST A FEW QUICK EXAMPLES OF WHAT THOSE COULD BE -- THERE ARE CERTAIN -- THRESHOLDS AND HOW AND THERE WOULD BE COLLECTION SITES AND TAKE BACK PROGRAMS AND REQUIREMENTS -- FOR HOW PHARMACIES PARTICIPATE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR AND IT'S CLEARLY ENFORCED AND M. ISN'T HAVE AT COUNTY THRESHOLD AND IF YOU'RE IN ALPINE COUNTY THAT'S VERY MUCH DIFFERENT THAN IT IS LA COUNTY. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY -- BY THE RETAIL PHARMACIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THOSE ADDRESSED -- IN THE BILL AND LASTLY AND WITH RESPECT TO SHARPS -- SHARPE SERVED VERY DIFFERENT DISPOSAL. SYSTEM THAN A DRAW THAN DRUGS -- PHARMACIES HAVE NOT BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF DISPOSAL OF SHARPS AND THERE ARE MANY PHARMACIES THAT ACTUALLY ACTIVELY VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN -- DRUG TAKE BACK -- BUT THEY ARE NOT AS THAT THEY HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY BEEN AS INVOLVED IN SHARPE'S TAKE BACK AT LEAST FOR COLLECTION SITES AND SO WE WOULD REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S SOME SPECIFIC DISCUSSION ABOUT SHARKS THAT BURGER. THANK YOU MICHELLE REVERSE WHAT THE CALIFORNIA FARM. ASSOCIATION ANA ECHO THE COMMENTS [inaudible] COLLEAGUES SNYDER AND CPJ WORK WHERE YOU APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AND A COMMENT AND AGAIN WE HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS AND IT'S RELIGIOUS CLARIFICATION WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE OVERALL GOALS OF THIS LEGISLATION AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THE END RESULT IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN ALL LIVE WITH BUT AGAIN JUST SOME ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION AND ONE OF THE ISSUES FOR*. ON THE BILL THAT STATES THAT PHARMACIES SHALL MAKE A REASONABLE EFFORT TO BECOME A COLLECTOR AND THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF WHAT REASONABLE IS. AND THERE IS AS YOU KNOW AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM IN THIS HI YOU IN FOR SOMETHING THAT ISN'T CLEARLY DEFINED SO AGAIN WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. CLEAR DEFINITION OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE WERE ALSO HOPEFUL THAT IN ORDER TO BE A PARTICIPANT IN THIS PROGRAM SOME OTHER IDEAS HER -- WAYS TO CLICK THE MEDICATIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED OTHER THAN JUST RECEPTACLES THERE ARE OTHER MECHANISMS OUT THERE THERE ARE DEVICES CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET TO AND DE ACTIVATE THE DRUGS IT'S A SIMPLE LITTLE ENVELOPE YOU POUR THE DRUGS AND YOU MIX IT AROUND IN THIRTY SECONDS LATER. IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EASILY THROWN AWAY SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THOSE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS WAYS FOR PHARMACIES TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN AGAIN. THANK YOU EVERYBODY FOR THE WORK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER OVER THE SUMMER. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL CHO HAD. TO KAREN MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS ON BEHALF OF VIACOM AND IT'S OVER ONE THOUSAND LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS ARE -- BIOMEDICAL COMPANIES -- AND SHARP COMPANIES BOTH SO WE ARE ALSO AN OPPOSING LET'S AMENDED POSITION AND WE WOULD LOVE TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE BILL MOVE FORWARD AND THAT DISCUSSION MOVE FORWARD TODAY -- BUT WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ADDRESSED IN THE PROCESS TOO AMONG THOSE ARE. PLACING GUARDRAILS AROUND THE FUNDING SINCE IT'S MANUFACTURED FUNDING BILL AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE SO OPEN ENDED WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ON THAT. HOW YOU DEAL WITH PRODUCT IN A CLINICAL SETTING AND THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STATEWIDE ORDINANCE AND THE LOCAL ORDINANCES SO WITH THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS AND WE THANK COMMITTEE FOR ITS WORK? THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL. MISTER HARRIMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FRED MAIN ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION. FOR ACCESSIBLE MEDICINE WHICH ARE THAT. GENERIC OF PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS IN THE OUR COUNTRY AT THE TIME. ASSOCIATION HAS UNOPPOSED UNLESS AMENDED PROVISION OUR POSITION THAT WE PRIVATE PROVIDED NOT. EXTENSIVE WITH THAT'S OKAY WE JUST WANNA HEAR THE AMENDMENT PART PASS OUT. TWO PROVISIONS THAT WE'D LIKE THAT COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT ARE THE COVERAGE OF WHO'S IN -- PROGRAM RIGHT NOW IT SAID MANUFACTURERS A AS DEFINED WILL WIND UP PAYING THE P. S. ULTIMATELY TO BE ESTABLISHED WE THINK. OF THE STREAM OF COMMERCE SHOULD BE A MORE EXPANSIVE IN THAT IN SECOND ON THE ALLOCATION. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO -- GUIDE GUIDE RAILS AS WAS POINTED OUT ON HOW THE FEE WOULD BE A ALLOCATED A WE THINK THE BILL SHOULD BE MORE. A SPECIFIC ON THAT WE THINK -- THIS -- ALLOCATION A SHOULD BE BASED ON A REVENUE A RATHER THAN -- VOLUME AND HOPE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT OVER THE SUMMER GREAT THANK YOU. GO AHEAD ITS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I DON'T LEAVE YOU HANGING THE CASE YOU ASKED FOR SHARPS PEOPLE BUT YEAH SHARPS SHARP IS GOOD OKAY WE CAN START ON SHARPE'S NECK WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THEM ANYWAY.

PAINT AND MATTRESS AND I KNOW THAT -- THOSE ISSUES ARE OF VERY FAMILIAR TO THE A ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE ISSUES -- WE ALSO HAD CONVERSATIONS JUST YESTERDAY ABOUT. TO A BILL RELATED -- TO THE LATEST EFFORT TO OUR ADDRESS ANOTHER CHALLENGING AIR AREA WHICH IS TO UPDATE THE BOTTLE BILL. AND THE THE CHALLENGES OF THE THE LACK OF RECYCLING CENTERS. AND THE THAT THAT THE CHALLENGE OF HOW TO MAKE. THE COLLECTIONS ARE MOST EFFECTIVE BY MAKING THEM -- THAT THEM THEM -- MOST CONVENIENT AND ACCESSIBLE AND SO ON YEAH I I WOULD LIKE -- TO YOU TO BE PART OF THIS PROCESS IN AND AND TRY TO BRING IN THE THE EXPERTISE OF THE THAT NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE ARE AND THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THESE PROGRAMS [inaudible] TWO WELL. TO TRY [inaudible] TO MAKE THIS. THE BEST PROGRAM AGAIN HALF OUR STATE. I WILL CERTAINLY. BE GLAD IF YOU CAN LEARN THE SOME OF YOUR STAFF INFANT DOT TO HELP WITH THIS. AND YOU WERE ALSO GOING TO BE ASKING THAT SANITY Q. AND PERHAPS THAT HEALTH COMMITTEES TODD TOGETHER SAID THEIR INPUT AS WELL BECAUSE THE SENATE HASN'T SEEN THIS BILL AT ALL SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THERE COMMITTEES ARE. WORK WITH US ON THIS UNDER UP LEADERSHIP OF MY CHIEF CONSULTANT ARE MISTER TUCKER. SO WE WILL DEFINITELY AVAIL OURSELVES OF ANY EXPERTISE YOU HAVE [inaudible] THANK YOU. A MISTER A MATHIS THEY YOU MISTER CHAIR FIRST SENATOR AND COLLEAGUES -- IN HERE. UNDERGOING SOMETHING THAT DEFTLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN OUR STATE AND HAVE A STATEWIDE. PROGRAM IS. SOMETHING WE VITALLY NEEDED ESPECIALLY KNOW ON THE SERVER IN OUR RURAL AREAS. THAT WE HAVE -- IN IN HAVING THE CONCERNS ARE. YEAH IT'S A A SET ON A NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE WORK FOR AG AND RURAL. LIKE COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC SOME THAT WE TALK ABOUT THEIR ON THE AND I KNOW THEY'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S GOING ON OF THIS LEGISLATION TO SHELL. I I DO HAVE SOME CURRENT CONCERNS ARE MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE AG INDUSTRY GUYS. ON WITH THE VETERINARY CONCERN BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THE AIM OF THIS BILL. WAS TO GO LAUGHTER VETERINARY SIDE I THINK WE'RE LOOKING MORE FOR THE HOUSEHOLD IN IN THE KIDS AT PARTIES AND DOING THOSE THINGS ARE MAKING SURE WE CAN GET THOSE OFF THE STREETS -- SOME REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU SEE IN IN THE CONVERSATION THAT. YOU KNOW IT IN EXPRESSLY -- SENATOR I KNOW YOU LIKE TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER IN A ROOM CAN HASH THINGS OUT AND GET IT DONE AND I APPRECIATE YOU -- TREMENDOUSLY FOR THAT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT WE'RE LIKE A MONTH WITH OVER THE SUMMER. I KNOW -- SPEAKING WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER RURAL GUYS YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL KIND OF ENCOURAGES SEE SOMETHING HAPPEN BUT YOU GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING SO. BUT ALL IT WITH THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. YEAH CERTAINLY THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND I'M THANK YOU FOR TAKING IT ON A GOOD JUST COUPLE REALLY QUICK QUESTIONS DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO COST. WELL WE DO KNOW THAT -- THAT THERE'S BEEN AN ACTIVE PROGRAM UP IN A BRITISH COLUMBIA FOR ABOUT TWENTY YEARS THAT IRONICALLY WAS SET UP BY THE INDUSTRY ITSELF. AND THE COST RUNS AT ABOUT ONE TENTH OF ONE CENT FOR EACH PRESCRIPTION. SO THE ITSO MINIMAL COST AND SO I'D IT YOU'RE TRYING TO FOLLOW THEIR THEIR THEIR PROGRAMMING WELL IF IF THEY'RE CERTAINLY A GUIDE POST -- WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WELL OBVIOUSLY WE'LL DO OUR OWN PROGRAM BUT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS THEY INCINERATE THEIR PRODUCTS IN THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENCES IN. IN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT IT'S WE WANT TO KEEP. OKAY. AND DOES THE BILL HAVE ANY PROVISIONS THAT WOULD THAT ARE GOING TO HELP THE A SHARPS DISPOSAL BY PEOPLE WITH DRUG ADDICTIONS AND THE HOMELESS. I WE WE HEAR THE STORIES IN SAN FRANCISCO ABOUT THE NEEDLES BEING ON ON THE SIDEWALK AND SO FORTH AND DOES THIS BILL HELP ADDRESS STEP. VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM. THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE ON THE SHARP SIDE. ARM. ONE THING AND AS I BELIEVE. MISTER MISS MISTER KALRA TALKED ABOUT IS JUST MAKING EVERYTHING MORE CONVENIENT AND THAT'S REALLY. WHY WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH% SORT OF ZONES AND AREAS WHERE? CAN KNOW WHERE TO DISPOSE OF THAT'S I THINK THE HOPE IS THAT ONCE PEOPLE KNOW WHERE THEY CAN GO THEY WILL DO IT. NOW AGAIN YOU HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO HAVE. I TIMES VERY SERIOUS ISSUES SO THING THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE UP HUMPED TEMPERATURES PATIENT BUT THE HOPE IS THAT THE MORE CONVENIENT WE CAN MAKE. FOR EVERYBODY THAT -- FOLKS WALK RESPONSIBLY. OKAY. WELL. I AM HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN REACH A POLICY THAT ADDRESSES MORE THE STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF THEM ALREADY. AND I'M NOT QUITE THERE BUT I'M HOPING THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THOSE THINGS WORK IN THE SUMMER SO ONE AGAINST THE FOR THE LIKE SPORT MAKE IT [inaudible] OKAY. A DOCTOR ARAMBULA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I'M NOT START MY COMMENTS BY THINKING THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING THIS TO A NECESSARY -- BILL FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HAD ON I AM GONNA. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PROCESS THOUGH AND I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF DOT CONCERNS BASED ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TODAY I'M WILLING TO ALLOW THIS TO GO FORWARD. BUT WANTS TO MAKE SURE THE VOICES OF OUR AD COMMUNITY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE HURT. THAT THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL POLICY DOES NOT. OVERLY HURT AN INDUSTRY THAT'S THIS CITY HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN TO KIND TWO AND SO WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY POLICIES WE PUSH OUT. ARE RECOGNIZING THAT AND TAKING CARE OF OUR AG COMMUNITIES. I'M SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT BOTH THE MEDICATED FEED ON THE VETERINARY MEDICINE PORTIONS THIS. SECONDARILY I UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC BETWEEN TRYING -- TO COMBINING STATEWIDE POLL -- BUT THEY'RE NOT UBIQUITOUS AND SOME OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE ARE STEMMING FROM WHAT OCCURS WITHIN A HOSPITAL SO I'D. LIKE SOME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENS IN MORE CLINIC SETTINGS WHAT HAPPENS IN MORE RURAL SETTINGS HOW DOES THIS ACTUALLY GET IMPLEMENTED AND SO -- THERE MAY BE A PLENTY OF TIME FOR US TO DISCUSS WITH THIS BUT IN LIGHT OF THE PROCESS THAT I STARTED WITH THIS I'D LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORS TO BE ABLE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS BILL. AND MAKE SURE THIS IS THE BEST POLICY THAT WE CAN PUSH FORWARD. BOMB YOU KNOW THE ENEMY A PERFECT SHOULD NOT BE GOOD AND I DON'T INTEND TO STOP THIS IN ITS TRACKS BUT WANT US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PUT IT. BEST POLICY FORWARD AND I BELIEVE THAT'S TAKING AND WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND I IMPROVING UPON THIS AND HOPE THAT'S WHAT COMES BACK IN AUGUST -- BUT THERE ARE CONCERNS OF BOTH FROM THOSE OF US WHO ARE GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY A WHO WANTS TO MAKE SURE THIS IS A BETTER PRODUCT GOING FORWARD TOTALLY AGREE. ALRIGHT ARE PERHAPS YOU WOULD. LIKE DID THE AUTHORS THEN -- COULD DE BRIEFLY I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GET OFF TO CHAIR YOU'RE A JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND YOU HAVE SIXTY TWO BILLS. THREE SIXTY THREE SO I KNOW YOU'D LIKE TO GET THAT OFF SO. APPROACH YOU COULD DO THE THREE OF YOU COULD CLOSE QUICKLY AND THAT WILL GET ON TO THE NEXT MATTER -- THANK YOU AN AND DOES THIS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET. SOMETHING GOING FOR QUITE SOME TIME I WON'T REFERRED WOOD IS SORT OF A FORM OF RELUCTANCE ON EVERYBODY'S PART. EVERYBODY'S AT THE TABLE NOW THAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE'VE HAD IS TO GET EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT THIS. THERE THERE THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT. HAPPEN FRANKLY SORT RECENTLY AND AS A RESULT OF THERE ARE LOTS OF VERY GOOD POINTS AND I THINK AN OPEN AND HONEST AND FRANK DISCUSSION. IS WHAT WE FINALLY ARE GETTING AND I THINK WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO RESPONDING -- AND TRYING TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED AND BY ALLOWING US TO CONTINUE IN THIS PROCESS I THINK WE ARE. A BY OPENING THAT DOOR. OUR BUDDY 80% OF THE WAY THERE IT WAS JUST GETTING THAT DOOR OPEN THAT'S BEEN REALLY THE CHALLENGE AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THERE WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE -- TO COME TO A A GOOD RESOLUTION AND TO WITH THAT I WOULD SIMPLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OKAY. BECAUSE I REMEMBER TENGAN GRAY OKAY -- SO LET ME -- I THINK I HEARD FROM SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. NOW I THINK IT SHOULD ONLY BE A STATE WIDE PROGRAM IF IT'S BETTER THAN ALL THE LOCAL PROGRAMS. I THINK IF WE CAN DO THAT THEN WE CAN BRING PEOPLE ALONG TO MAKE IT A STATE WIDE PROGRAM BUT IT REALLY HAS TO BE BETTER -- I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PROGRAM THE FIRST ONE IN THE STATE -- I FOLLOWED IT WHEN IT WAS LEGISLATION I FOLLOWED IT IN THE COURT CASE BUT THEN I NEVER HEARD ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY HAVE A PROGRAM. NOBODY IN HAYWARD KNOWS THE COLLECTION SITES ARE IN OBSCURE PLACES THIS FORTY ONE THE COUNTY BUT THERE TYPICALLY AT VERY SMALL. SORT OF MOM AND POP PHARMACIES THAT OCCASIONALLY -- KAISER AS TAKEN ABACK WHICH IS A MAJOR THING BECAUSE HALF THE PEOPLE PROBABLY TO USE KAISER. BUT FOR ANYONE WHO ISN'T USING KAISER. THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM -- IN MY OPINION WE SHOULD HAVE EVERY PHARMACY VIEW PART OF DRUG TAKE BACK. SHARP SHOULD CLEARLY DIFFERENT I DON'T THINK THE SHARPS PART OF THIS PROGRAM IS MATURE YET. IT IS HARD TO GET BILLS OFF THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AND IF THE SHARPS PART IS NOT BETTER IT IT RISKS. BRINGING DOWN THE WHOLE BILL SO YOU MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT MAKING THE SHARPS PART SEPARATE IN NEGOTIATING THAT SEPARATE. ARE BUT I THINK THE DRUGS PART IF WE CAN MAKE IT EFFECTIVE AND AGAIN I HEARD THAT FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. HERE IN THE WITNESSES WE HAVE TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE I REALLY THINK THAT MEANS EVERY PHARMACY. HAS A BOX OF SOME KIND A LOCK BOX THAT TAKES THE DRUGS. ARM THAT THE PHARMACIST SAID HEY IF YOU DON'T FINISH ALL OF THIS BRING IT BACK. I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A REALLY EFFECTIVE PROGRAM I'M WILLING TO LISTEN TO OTHER WAYS. BUT AGAIN. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PROGRAM WHICH TO MY MIND IT SHOULD BE STATEWIDE AND BETTER THAN ANY OF THE LOCAL PROGRAMS -- ON THE VETERINARY SIDE A BILL CAN BE KILLED BY THE PEOPLE FROM OUR RURAL AREAS I KNOW THIS FOR A FACT. ARM AND SO I AYE YEAH EXACTLY EXACTLY. HE IS ONE OF THE CULPRITS ARE MISTER GRAY -- SHALL I WOULD BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THE VETERINARY PROGRAM -- PARTICULARLY MEDICATED FEED BY AND LARGE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE THAT FEEDS I DON'T THINK THEY THINK THEY CAN JUST STORED ON SITE AS LONG AS IT'S NOT GETTING IN THE WATERS. IT SHOULD BE FINE AND ANYWAY TRY AND MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE LET'S SEE -- THING ELSE. ALRIGHT SO -- I KNOW YOU'VE AGREED TO WORK WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS ARE WITH THAT JOSH WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU S. THAT. CHIEF ARE CONSULTANT BUT WILL BE BRINGING IN CONSULTANTS FROM. OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AS WELL AS A SANITY Q. AND PROBABLY HEALTH AND OTHERS WHO WANT TO GET INVOLVED -- SO WE REALLY WANT A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM WE REALLY WANT THIS DONE AND I HOPE.

AGING INFRASTRUCTURE MORE STRINGENT WATER QUALITY STANDARDS IN THE EFFECTS OF WATER CONSERVATION ON REVENUE. PUSH WATER COSTS AND REGINALD RESIDENTIAL WATER RATES HIGHER AND HIGHER. MORE THAN FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE'S ELEVENTH LARGEST WATER UTILITIES ARE IMPACTED BY AFFORDABILITY COSTS OF LIVING ISSUES. SAN DIEGO SIX THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS ALONE FAYSAL THE LOTS OF WATER SERVICE. DUE TO DELINQUENT BILLS EACH YEAR. WHILE THERE CAN CONSISTENT LIFELINE PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE HAVING DIFFICULTY PAYING THEIR ELECTRIC GAS AND TELEPHONE BILLS. THEIR ONLY A PATCHWORK OF LOCAL POLICIES FOR WATER BILL DELINQUENCIES. S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT SIX TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. WHO FACE TERMINATION OF THEIR WATER SERVICE IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS? IT REQUIRES PUBLISHED WATER AGENCY POLICIES FOR DEFERRED PAYMENTS ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PLANS IT APPEALS. IT REQUIRES WAITING PERIODS BEFORE TERMINATING SERVICE IN REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTACTING THE REPAIR. IT LIMITS DISK INTO A CONTINUATION IN THE EVENT OF A LIFE AND HEALTH SAFETY PROBLEMS WERE SEVERE ECONOMIC HARDSHIP. PROVIDED THAT THE RATE PAYER COMPLIES WITH CERTAIN CONDITIONS. THE BILL LIMITS FEES FOR RECONNECTING SERVICE FOR LOW INCOME WATER. A LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS. AND I HAVE A LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL OPINION THAT S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT DOES NOT CREATE. A PROP TO EIGHTEEN CONFLICT IT MAKES CLEAR THAT THE WATER AGENCY CAN'T EVENTUALLY COLLECT ON RAPIER DEBT THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT POINT HERE. THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE A PROP TO EIGHTEEN CONFLICT AND MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE WATER AGENCY CAN EVENTUALLY COLLECT ON THE RATEPAYERS DEBT. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY MANY PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU RIGHT WITNESSES. GOOD AFTERNOON TRAIL IF MEMBER TWO MINUTES EACH. MY NAME IS ALEXANDER HERNDON A HOUSING ADVOCATE WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR S. B.. NINE NINE EIGHT FOR THE LOW INCOME AND VULNERABLE TENANTS THAT WE REPRESENT A WATER SHUT OFF CAN HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCE FOR EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES. YOU CAN THREATEN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH FOOD SECURITY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HOUSING SUBSIDIES FAMILY AND COMMUNITY COHESION AND THE ABILITY TO GET AND MAINTAIN A JOB. AS A LEGAL AID ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES I REPRESENTED A LOW INCOME MOTHER OF THREE WHO'S WATER WAS SHUT OFF WHEN HER LANDLORD FAILED TO PAY THE BILL FOR HER ENTIRE APARTMENT BUILDING. SPIKE CONTINUING TO CHARGE TENANTS MONTHLY FOR THEIR WATER USE. IN ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION WITH HER LANDLORD -- OR WHILE SHE WAS ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION WITH HER LANDLORD AND FORCE HER HOUSING RIGHTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND FAMILY SERVICES BEGAN THREATENING TO REMOVE HER CHILDREN FROM HER HOME DUE TO THE LACK OF RUNNING WATER. I'M AND SO EVENTUALLY FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ENFORCING THOSE HOUSING RIGHTS. AND PROTECTING YOUR FAMILY SAFETY SHE ABANDONED HER HOUSING AND WAS FORCED TO MOVE OUT AND OFTEN THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT THESE LOW INCOME RENTERS A LACK SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER THE SITUATION THAT LEAD TO A SHUT OFF EITHER BECAUSE THE LANDLORD IS THE ONE WHO HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ACTUALLY. PAY THE WATER BILL -- OR BECAUSE THEY'RE ABILITY TO REPAIR INFRASTRUCTURE OF A A WATER LEAK THAT CAN LEAD TO A VERY HIGH BILL -- OR IN AND VERY IMPORTANT SITUATIONS A SHUT OFF CAN LEAD THAT CAN RESULT FROM A DESTRUCTIVE LIFE EVENT LIKE A DISEASE OR A LOSS OF OF A JOB THAT THAT LEADS TO AN ECONOMIC DISRUPTION -- SO S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT TAKES AN IMPORTANT STEP. TO MAKING THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER A REALITY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT AND WE STRONGLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DEBBIE OR SOME STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THE COMMUNITY WATER CENTER. A COMMUTER CENTER WAS ONE OF THE STE A LEAD SUPPORTERS WHEN THEY WHEN THE STATE WAS TRY TO PASS A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER LEGISLATION BACK IN. TWENTY TWELVE S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT IS A NECESSARY TOOL IN OUR STATES TOOLBOX AS WERE ATTEMPTING TO ACTUALLY REALIZE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. THE FBI NAY NAY WILL PROVIDE PREPARE PROTECTIONS FOR WATER UTILITY CUSTOMERS THAT ALREADY EXIST FOR AT FOR MANY ENERGY UTILITIES. A WHILE WE AGREE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD PAY THEIR BILL IN TIME AND ON FOR IN FULL THERE. ARE SITUATIONS WHERE. LIFE COMES UP AND YOU CANNOT PAY YOUR BILL THAT FOR A MOMENT -- SETTING UP CLEAR TRANSPARENT POLICIES ON HOW -- WATER DISCONTINUATION OCCURS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE AND WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE TO PREVENT DISCONTINUATION SERVICE AND HOW THEY CAN PAY THEIR BILLS WHEN THEY'RE ABLE -- TO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE AND IT WILL HELP PREVENT. A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACTS TO VOTER POPULATION SUCH AS THOSE WITH MEDICAL CONDITIONS WHO WOULD BE GREATLY EXACERBATED OR HAVE LIFE THREATENING IMPACTS IF WATER WAS CUT OFF. OR FOR INFANTS AND CHILDREN WHICH I THINK WE ALL AGREE SHOULD NOT BE -- LET WITH HOT WATER. EVERY CONSUMER THE RIGHT UNDERSTAND AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE SPELL. THANK YOU BOB OTHERS IN SUPPORT OUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION. NICHOLAS CHáVEZ ON BEHALF THE GOING STATE MANUFACTURED HOMEOWNERSHIP ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING SENIORS VETERANS IMMIGRANTS AND LOW MODERATE AND FIXED INCOME INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN MOBILE HOME PARKS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ON SUPPORT OF SB NINE NINE EIGHT THANK YOU. HE BE SEEN LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN STRONG SUPPORT. THERESA BROKERAGE FOR THE LOCAL DIRECTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND SERIES IN SUPPORT. REBECCA MARKETS REPRESENTING FOOD AND WATER WATCH IN SUPPORT. ANDREA VENTURA WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. AND YOU MEANS FISHER WITH THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS A CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT. ARM. CHAU I HAD A MEETING YESTERDAY WITH THE LOCAL WATER COMPANIES WHO I KNOW ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE WATER BUT I KNOW THEY HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH THE BILL. AND IF I COULD HAVE -- I REPRESENTATIVES OUT FOR IN OPPOSITION NOW. AGAIN THESE PEOPLE ARE FOR MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE WIDER THEY JUST HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS. GUY HAD GOOD AFTER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN QUIRK AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M WENDY RITTER BUSH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES ARE AQUA. AND A AS YOU NOTED OUR MEMBER AGENCIES DELIVER SAFE RELIABLE HIGH QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE WATER TO CUSTOMERS IN A DEPENDABLE AND RESPONSIBLE MANNER. PUBLIC WATER DISTRICTS ARE OVERSEEN BY THEIR LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS OF DIRECTORS THEY MAKE DECISIONS IN THEIR GEOGRAPHIC SERVICE TERRITORIES BASED ON WHAT WORKS LOCALLY. WATER AGENCIES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF DELIVERING WATER THEY DON'T DISCONNECT DELINQUENT CUSTOMERS WITHOUT PRIOR SUBSTANTIAL ENGAGEMENT. WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN HIS STAFF LESS BOND FOR ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS IN THE SENATE THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS DELETED LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THAT A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. MAKE A PHYSICAL VISIT TO DETERMINE THAT A WATER SHUT OFF EVEN A TEMPORARY ONE WOULD NOT POSE A GRAVE THREAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF A CUSTOMER PRIOR TO A SHUT OFF. AND UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS INCLUDING SEVERAL MEETINGS BETWEEN THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND OUR COALITION. I COME TO AGREEMENT ON THE BILL'S LANGUAGE THEY'RE STILL REMAIN IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE CRAFTED WE REQUESTED WHICH HAVE BEEN REJECTED TODAY AND THESE INCLUDE THE ISSUES OF RECONNECT GEN FEES AND COST SHIFTING. AND AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THE AUTHOR HAS RECEIVED ALLEGE COUNSEL OPINION ON A VERY SPECIFIC SLICE OF THE BILL. THE OPINION DISCUSSES ONE SECTION. SIX NINE A EIGHT WHICH DETAILS NEW RESTRICTIONS ON DIS CONNECTIONS OF WATER SERVICE FOR NON PAYMENT. WITH THE OPINION DOES NOT DO IS WAY EN ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PROP TWO EIGHTEEN TO HELP AND KIDS SAFETY CODE SECTION ONE ONE SIX NINE ONE TWO WHICH APPEARS LATER IN THE BILL AND CREATES A CAP ON THE FEES. FOR THE COST OF PHYSICALLY RECONNECTING WATER SERVICE FOR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE NOT BELOW THE 2100% FEDERAL POVERTY LINE IT ALSO WAVES THE RECONNECTION FEES ALTOGETHER FOR THOSE UNDER THE LINE. OUR CONCERN IS WHAT WOULD OCCUR WHEN THIS ARBITRARY CAP ON THE RE CONNECTIONS FEET IS BELOW THE ACTUAL COST OF SERVICE IF YOU COULD DAM. I I THINK YOUR POINT IS MADE AND YOU HAVE SIX SECONDS YEAH ACTUALLY SIX SECONDS LATTER MACON AND DEATH IF. ASSUMING THAT THE OTHER WITNESS WANTS TO MANAGE YES. I'M I WILL DISCLOSE THAT -- WE CARE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY WE CARE ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS. I AND WHAT WE WANT TO SEE IS WE WANT TO SEE A WATER SERVICE SHUT OFF UP PROVISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE THE LOCALS ARE REALLY. THE BEST PLACE TO DECIDE ON HOW TO DO THAT AND HOW DID YOU THAT BEST IN THEIR AREAS THANK YOU. DON'T KNOW WHAT'S UP WITH CALIFORNIA'S FOR UTILITIES ASSOCIATION AND WE ALSO MUST UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSE SB NINE NINE EIGHT AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED YOU KNOW SENIOR WAYS MEMBER AGENCIES CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS. THE INTENT OF THE OF THE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE GOVERNING SHUT OFFS IS TO ENSURE THAT WATER SERVICES DISCONTINUED FOR NON PAYMENT. ONLY WHEN A CUSTOMER FAILS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH MULTIPLE SAFEGUARDS BUILT INTO THE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF WATER SYSTEMS THAT WERE CONCERNED THAT THE TOP DOWN APPROACH IN S. B. NINE NINE EIGHT IS REALLY A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM. THERE'S CURRENTLY NO WIDESPREAD DATA THAT SUPPORTS THE ASSERTION THAT LARGE SWATHS OF LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE HAVING THEIR WATERSHED OFF FOR NON PAYMENT OR INABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION WHILE THE HUMAN RIGHTS WATER HAS BEEN REFERENCE TO IT BY SUPPORTERS HIS REASONING FOR THE SPELL AND WE FEEL THAT'S IMPORTANT AS WELL. THAT STATUTE CONTAINS LESS PUBLIC IT SAYS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS SECTION SHALL NOT INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS RESPONSIBILITIES OF ANY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM. AND THE LANGUAGE IN S. B. NINE AND A CURRENTLY INFRINGES ON THOSE RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES BY FORCING AND YOU COST SHIFTING FROM ONE SET OF CUSTOMERS TO THE OTHER. OR TO ANOTHER SET PARTICULARLY THE ARBITRARY CAP ON RECONNECTION FEES. WE BELIEVE THERE'S EXISTING STATUTE RELATED TO THIS ISSUE IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THAT GOVERNS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE WATER SYSTEMS WE BELIEVE THAT IF CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE. TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL ISSUES WE SHOULD USE THE EXISTING STATUTORY FRAMEWORK AND WE URGE A NO VOTE. ALL RIGHT OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON ROUND TO ROSSI WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION POSITION THANK YOU.

WHO'S GONNA PAY -- FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CAPS AND THE ACTUAL COST OF RECONNECTING WATER SERVICE WELL TO THE TO DO THAT TO THE FIRST QUESTION -- I BELIEVE. WHAT I'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT MY DISTRICT? YEAH I'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS THROUGHOUT NIGHT YOU KNOW MATCH AND SAN DIEGO I HAD I WAS TRYING TO KEEP BY. TALKING POINTS SHORT BUT THE I COULD GO ON AND ON ABOUT SAID THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE -- FEEL FREE TO GO ON AND ON GREAT I SAID MORT BY PIPE. FOR FIVE POINT FIVE FEET MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE'S UP ELEVEN LARGEST WATER UTILITIES. ARE IMPACTED BY WATER AFFORDABILITY RIGHT NOW OUR OTHER UTILITIES POWER AND GAS AND PHONE HAVE LIFELINE RATES THAT ARE. DONE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A ED CHIU OFTEN PARTICULAR ONE ONE COMMUNITY IN LAKE COUNTY RIGHT NOW WHICH IS. WHICH IS ON FIRE WE HAVE IT'S NOT A MATTER OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE -- YELLOW LOSE THEIR WATER IT'S WHO. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE A ELDERLY THERE ON A HOSPICE PEOPLE THAT HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN THAT DID NEED SUPPORT AND WHILE THESE ORGANIZATIONS MORE THAN LIKELY TAKEN AT THEIR WORD THEY'RE ALL GOOD PEOPLE SOLID ORGANIZATIONS. THAT THEY REPRESENT -- THEIR MEMBERS PERHAPS DUE BUT NOT ALL. WATER PURVEYORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ANY POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. IN THIS REGARD AND THIS IS WHY IT'S NECESSARY I I WOULD AGREE. ONLY TO THE FACT THAT -- YA ON THAT CAP I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THE YOU KNOW THE OPPONENTS ON THIS AS WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD -- BECAUSE THAT WAS KIND OF NEW TO ME ABOUT THE PROP.

AND IN TALKING WITH THE OUTSIDE THE CONCERNED PARTIES THE WATER DISTRICTS [inaudible] ARE. THEY HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS NOW BUT IF THIS TO EIGHTEEN ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW THE TO EIGHTEEN DEMANDS THAT [inaudible] EVERY LITTLE [inaudible] TRANSACTION. BE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT THE RECONNECTION FEE. WHO AVERAGED OVER TIME WOULD BE MUCH MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS -- YOU MAY HAVE SOME CASES WHERE A TYRANT SOMEWHERE IT'S LOWER BUT IF YOU WANT TO COME UP WITH A DEFINITION -- OR OR TO WORK THAT OUT WITH THE AUTHOR THAT'S FINE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT TO EIGHTEEN REPLY IS A IS A FACTOR FOR EVERY LITTLE CHARGE -- HOWEVER I DO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WORK OUT OF THE GOVERNOR DECIDES IT IS THEN YOU KNOW THAT BELL MAY NOT GO WHERE WE WANTED TO GO. A SECOND ISSUE THAT I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BUT THOUGH IT DIDN'T COME UP IN TESTIMONY WAS JUST WHO CAN SAY THAT A PERSON HAS A MEDICAL PROBLEM. ARE WE CLEARLY DON'T WANT THAT JUST TO BE M. DIS ARE BUT THEY LIKE A A CLOSER -- DEFINITION. OF WHO MIGHT BE A MEDICAL. PERSON TO PITCH YOU COULD DATA SPEAK FOR THAT. OUR DEFINITION OF RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. UPDATE KNOWLEDGE THE PROBLEM WITH A MOBILE HOMEOWNER OR RENTER WHOSE PAIN FOR THE WIDER BUT THE OWNER IS NOT -- AND THEY WANTED TO HAVE A DIFFERENT DEFINITION -- AND THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION OF IF IT'S A P. YOU SEE REGULATED UTILITY SHOULD THE P. YOU SEE TO THE ENFORCEMENT RATHER THAN. THE ETERNAL ATTORNEY GENERAL -- I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS WORTH YOUR WORTH THINKING ABOUT IF YOU CAN BRING OFF OPPOSITION. WHICH I HOPE YOU CAN I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THIS. AS A AS A FLOOR. AND AGAIN IN THE BILL IT DOES SPECIFICALLY SAY IF YOU HAVE OTHER. WAYS OF REACHING THESE GOALS THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR WHERE WORK LOOKING FOR REACHING THE GOALS. SO I WOULD AND AGAIN IF THE HG IS SAM [inaudible] ENFORCING THIS -- OR THE P. YOU SEE THEIR NECK AND LOOK AT EVERY LITTLE THING THEY'RE GONNA WANT TO KNOW ARE YOU. ARE YOU REALLY -- CHIEF IN THE GOAL OF MAKING SURE PEOPLE'S WIDER IS NOT CUT OFF IN HIM. IF THEY'RE HAVING AN EMERGENCY AND ALSO THAT -- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF A LIFELINE PROGRAM THAT BECAUSE OF TO EIGHTEEN WE DON'T HAVE LIFELINE PROGRAMS THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO EIGHTEEN PROHIBITS THAT. AND SO WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM WITH WATER -- THAN WE DO WITH -- ELECTRICAL WHICH IS MOSTLY DONE BY THE THREE MAJOR UTILITIES -- ALTHOUGH THAT'S CHANGING TO AN I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EIGHTEEN WILL COME INTO WHETHER WILL STILL HAVE LIFELINE NOW THAT WE HAVE. A COMMUNITY -- CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAMS BUT WE'LL SEE. ANYWAY I DO THINK THE BILL IS NECESSARY AND I'M AT I AM RECOMMENDING AN AYE VOTE.

CONTROL BOARD TO ADOPT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TESTING OF MICRO PLASTICS AND DRINKING WATER. CURRENTLY WATER TREATMENT EFFORTS DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR ALL MICHAEL PLASTICS WHICH IS HOW FIBERS AND UP AND DRINKING WATER. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO COOPERATE THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY AND TO DETERMINE HOW EXACTLY THE FIBERS IMPACT OUR HEALTH. OF THE FACT REMAINS THAT PLASTICS ARE PRESENT AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT TO WHAT EXTENT IT'S CRUCIAL THAT THE PUBLIC BE MADE AWARE. OF TO THE EXTENT OF MICROPROCESSORS PRESENT TO IN DRINKING WATER AND POTENTIAL -- DANGER THEY POSE TO OUR HEALTH SO WE NEED MORE INFORMATION IN THIS GET TO FOR US RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I WROTE. VERY GOOD. ARMED IN SUPPORT. CHAIRED MEMBERS AGAIN MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE ENVIRONMENT A GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE IN SUPPORT OF SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THEIR WATER AND SPECIFICALLY PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS HAVE EMERGED AS A UNIQUE AND WIDESPREAD TYPE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. AND AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED RECENT RESEARCH ON THE PRESENCE OF MEGA PLASTICS AND TAP WATER AS WELL AS BOTTLED WATER HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE MONITORED PUBLICLY DISCLOSED AND ADDRESSED. AND WE APPRECIATE SANDERS LEADERSHIP UP ON THIS ISSUE THANKS. ALRIGHT OTHERS IN SUPPORT. GENEVIEVE ABBOTT ON BEHALF OF THE ELEVEN MEMBERS OF THE CLEAN SEIZE LOPPING COALITION IN SUPPORT. ANDREA VENTURA AND CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT. THREE SUBURBAN RICH ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY AND SUPPORT. ALRIGHT. DOT OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD TO TESTIFY. YOU CAN STAY I BELIEVE. THERE'S A LITTLE. WHAT WILL HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS? THERE KNOW CLASS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WE HAVE AN OPPOSING LESS AMENDED POSITION ON SP. FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO WE BELIEVE THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL ARE PREMATURE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS INCLUDING A LACK OF STANDARDIZED DETECTION METHOD AND RESEARCH RELATED TO THE HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS OF MICRO PLASTICS. THAT BEING SAID WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING MORE ABOUT WHAT'S IN OUR DRINKING WATER WE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHORS OFFICE BUT ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE APPROACH. IT'S OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS REGARDING UNREGULATED CONTAMINATE MONITORING RULE FOR MY PREPOSTEROUS. COULD BE A PRODUCTIVE PATH FORWARD AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR IN HIS OFFICE ON THAT POTENTIAL AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL IF YOUR THINK YOU CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES AQUA ALSO HAS AN OPPOSING WITH AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. WE HAD SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD FILL SOME OF THE INFORMATION GAPS SORT OF LIKE THE PRO CHOICE THAT YOU HAD ON YOUR OTHER BILL ON OCEAN PROTECTION SP. TWELVE SIXTY THREE ARE WE TO LIKE THE SUGGESTION FROM THIS COMMITTEE STAFF ABOUT A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAT'S BASED ON THE ON ROAD REGULATED CONTAMINANT MONITORING ROLE. UP AND WE'D LIKE TO REVIEW IF THE COMMITTEE COULD GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE'D LIKE TO REVIEW THE LANGUAGE BUT WE THINK THAT COULD WORK WE DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE A PERMANENT RULE GOING INTO PERPETUITY -- BUT IT WOULD ON HAVE THAT GOV MONITORING THAT THE COMMITTEE IS LOOKING. FOR AND WE ALSO THINK THERE SHOULD BE A CERTIFIED LAB FOR THAT. SO THAT'S OUR COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH. ALL RIGHT ARM QUESTIONS FROM. OKAY SHE'S ME OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. A JACK HAWKS CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION WILL -- WE ALSO ADOPTED POSE UNLESS AMENDED AND CONCUR WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY OUR QUINCY ANYWAY [inaudible] ALRIGHT ARM [inaudible] QUESTIONS FROM. MEMBERS OF THE BILL UP OKAY SECOND. GO AHEAD. MR MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- THEY I I'VE JUST GOT THE FEW CONCERNS WITH IT AND I LIKE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH IT AND I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE A HIT WITH THESE MICRO PLASTICS -- THE I KNOW WHEN WE'RE DONE WITH AIR QUALITY WE TALK ABOUT PM TWO POINT FIVE AT THE PARTS PER MILLION BUT I'M NOT SEEING ANYTHING DISCUSSING WHAT THE PART FOR MILLIONS GONNA BE. WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE WHAT THE ACTUAL HUMAN A FAX GONNA BE? AND THEN AT WHAT WALT IMPORTANT. TWO NOTIFIER FOLKS BACK HOME YOU KNOW HEY THIS IS HAPPENING THIS IS IN YOUR WATER. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES AFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE ON HUMANS ARE. IT AND I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME OF THAT REFLECTED IN THE LANGUAGE JUST SO SO WAS WERE LETTING PEOPLE KNOW HEY THIS IS IN OUR WATER. WHAT IS THAT ME? THE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE A PANDEMIC ON WHERE HE FREAKS OUT. BECAUSE THIS IS IN THEIR WATER AND THEY ALL RUNNING GO BUY BOTTLED WATER WHICH AS WE KNOW BOTTLED WATER STANDARDS ARE. RIDLEY LOWER THAN WHAT OUR TAP WATER STANDARDS ARE. ON THE AND I'VE BEEN A PLENTY OF PLANTS IN IN WHEN YOU LOOKAT MICROPORTABLE OLOGY AND EVERYTHING ELSE GOING ON A IT'S JUST I'M I'M TRYING TO FATHOM WHAT. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO GET THROUGH ONE OF THOSE SYSTEMS. AND IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT GETS THROUGH THE SYSTEMS IT'S GONNA BE SO SMALL IT'S GONNA GO DIRECTLY INTO YOUR BLOODSTREAM ANYWAY -- WHICH BRINGS OTHER TERRIFYING PAID IS IN A PLACE. SO I MEAN I JUST LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING. WITHIN THE LANGUAGE THEY IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE SO THAT WAY. IT AS THESE THINGS ARE DETECTED WE'RE NOT JUST ON PEOPLE HEY THERE'S MICHAEL PLASTICS INNER WATER -- BECAUSE I CAN LEAD TO OTHER THINGS NOW I THINK IT'S HAVE POINT WELL TAKEN AND WITH THE AGENCIES AS WELL. YOU KNOW IT'S OUR HOPE AS THIS PROGRESSES TO WORK WITH. THE STAKEHOLDERS AS WE'VE BEEN DOING THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS. NOT BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF INFORMATION TO KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. AND ONCE WE KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT MEAN AND WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. AND THOSE ARE PART OF THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS SO -- I THINK THERE'S ROOM TO PUT THOSE PROVISIONS IN THE I I DON'T DISAGREE WITH. BUT WE JUST HAVEN'T WORDSMITH THEM YET BUT YOU KNOW WILL WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND WILL WORK WITH THE NOT SO SUBTLE BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AND THEY I JUST A AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I GET TO ADDRESS NOT I GREW. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ARM ACQUIESCED AND I WILL OKAY. THEN IF THEY'RE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS -- SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL AND WE'RE GONNA FIND WHEN THERE IS TESTING I HOPE THERE IS THE HOPE THE BILL GETS FORWARD. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. BOB THAT SOME IS WILL HAVE A LOT OF MICRO PLASTICS AND SOME WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE I SUSPECT WHERE I LIVED IN HAYWARD WHERE THE WATER COMES FROM. GREAT FOR COMES OFF THE GRANITE NEO SAMITY THAT -- THERE'S NO MICHAEL PLASTICS TO SPEAK UP. WHERE I LIVE NOW IN UNION CITY? SPECTER COULD BE QUITE A BIT BECAUSE WE GET WATER FROM OUT OF THE DELTA -- WHERE IT'S? WELL ALSO OF THINGS AND THAT WERE DRINKING THE SEWAGE FROM SACRAMENTO AMONG OTHER PLACES -- AT ANY RATE I'M I ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO SEE IF YOU CAN I BRING OPPOSITION OFF IT WILL CERTAINLY HELP. I GET THE BILL FORWARD AND IT'S ALWAYS HARD -- WHEN THERE'S OPPOSITION TO BE SURE THE BILL WILL PASS AND WELL LIME? A B. SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR SO IF SOMETHING CAN BE DONE THERE THAT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE VERY HELPFUL SAU. RECOMMENDING AYE VOTE -- POINT ONE OF THE POINTS MADE WAS THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS ARE YET. I THINK MAYBE THAT'S A TOPIC FOR ANOTHER BILL. BUT WITHOUT -- KNOWING WHERE THE PLASTIC PROBLEM IS -- WHEN WE DO GET THE INFORMATION WE WON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT'S I THINK? IT'S TWO SIDES OF A COIN YOU'VE DONE ONE SIDE PERHAPS NEXT YEAR WE CAN DO THE OTHER SIDE. THAT BEING SAID -- WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND I'M RECOMMENDING IT AYE VOTE AND MADAM SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO PORTANTINO DO PASS AND REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. AYE QUIRK AYE MATHIS MATHIS I KALRA [inaudible] ARAMBULA [inaudible] LACKEY [inaudible] LACKEY I HOLDEN. WHAT A TO G.? MINUTES WHICH I SWEAR FOR VOTES THEIR CURRENT NEW APPAREL THANK YOU [inaudible] WELL WHOEVER. BAGHDAD'S OKAY THE SENATE. YEAH OKAY WE HAD MADRE SO. THIS IS A GOOD MEASURE TO BE BRIEFED ON THANK YOU. I HOPE THEY'RE ALL GOOD THINGS CHAU. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR S. J. OUR TWENTY TWO FROM SENATOR WEST. THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP WITH THIS MEASURE. OUR SCR TWENTY TWO IS WAY LONG OVERDUE. IT'S RESOLUTION WHICH URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE US IV WC TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS. CROSS BORDER POLLUTION AND REQUIRE VALLEY OF COURSE I BE W. C. AS OUR ADVOCATE. IN NEGOTIATING TREATIES WITH MEXICO. BOB. THE DECLINE RIVER VALLEY AS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. ECOLOGY'S A IN IN CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE IT'S ALSO ONE OF THE OF MOST THREATENED. AT THE RIVERS IN AND OUT CALIFORNIA YEAH THE SEWAGE THAT POURS INTO THAT IS PRETTY MUCH KILLING THE ENVIRONMENT THERE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT ESTUARY. IT'S AND RAMS OUR SIDE ESTABLISHED BY THE U.. U. N. RAMS ARE COMMITTEE THERE ONLY A FEW ROUNDS ARE SITES IN THE WORLD. THIS IS ONE OF THEM. AND WITH TO REM'S OUR SON RAMS OUR SITE IS -- AN ENVIRONMENTAL SITE OF OF ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE WORLD IT'S A VERY UNIQUE SITE AND THERE AREN'T VERY MANY OF THEM IN THE WORLD AND THOSE ARE SITES THAT ARE THREATENED. THAT NEED TO BE PROTECTED AND THEY NEED TO BE RESTORED. AND THAT HASN'T BEEN ENOUGH. TO MOTIVATE THE AYE BWC TO ACT AND AND TAKE ACTIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. TO REDUCE THOSE. OUR WASTE WATER [inaudible] OF FLOWS. I FROM MEXICO. THAT HAVE CREATED -- JUSTA A BIG BIG PROBLEM THERE -- WE HAVE HAD. TWENTY EIGHT RAW SEWAGE SPILLS. TOTALING APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED MILLION GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE. BETWEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALONE. ARE THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HAS HAD. STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR THE TO QUITE A RIVER VALLEY AT LEAST FOR THE LAST. TWENTY FOUR YEARS THAT I KNOW. NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. AND I I APPLAUD. OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. HOWEVER SEVEN OFF FOR INITIATING LAWSUIT AGAINST UAB WC. YOU KNOW IT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO'S BEEN YOU KNOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE COUNTRY A DOESN'T MATTER IT'S JUST THAT HAS NOT WORKED. THIS HAS NOT BEEN MATE AND A UP PRIOR BUT IT BY ANY ADMINISTRATION. BUT THIS IS CREATING A A REDUCTION IN PROPERTY VALUES AND IMPERIAL BEACH AND IN SAN DIEGO. IT'S BECAUSE JUST A HEALTH CONCERNS OF THE SPREAD OF OF VIRUSES THROUGH MOSQUITOES ME WE'VE. IT'S A DISASTER. AND AND AND TIMES UP I THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD PLENTY OF TIME TO JUST ENFORCE THE TREATIES THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE TREATIES. THAT GET TO THIS ISSUE. AND THERE IS JUST NO ENFORCEMENT NO INTEREST TO MAKE. IMPROVEMENTS THERE AND ALL THE DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE HAVE ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE. AND WE'RE ASKING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO ITS JOB AND STEP UP AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE STATE IS LIMITED AS TO WEEK WHAT WE CAN DO BECAUSE OF THE BORDER READ REGION. YOU KNOW I'VE EVEN TRIED TO CREATE -- US BUT THIS SPECIAL PLANNING OVERS ON THAT CREATES A A WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE QUAN ARRIVE ALLEY. AND OF COURSE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS JURISDICTION SO THAT CAN HAPPEN AND WE'VE I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. FOR FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO EASILY -- AND AND IT'S GETTING FRUSTRATING BECAUSE I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS OUR PARTNER. IN MANY INSTANCES OF THE MEXICAN SIDE OF THE BORDER HAS BEEN A LITTLE MORE ACCOMMODATING THAT ARE ON FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A MASSIVE BUREAUCRACY AND I THINK THE ONLY THING THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE THIS IS IS A JUDICIAL DECISION. AND I THINK IF WE PUT DISTANCE THROUGH THE COURTS THAT WOULD REALLY HELP. BUT THIS THIS RESOLUTION I THINK IS NEEDED TO HELP WITH THIS LAWSUIT. TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE HAVE THE WEIGHT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE MAKING THIS PRIORITY FOR OUR STATE. NOW APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE HERE TODAY THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MATTER.

OKAY WARS ELIZALDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE SENATOR HERTZBERG. MOVE THE BILL. ALRIGHT WE'RE HEARING -- S. B.. TWELVE FIFTEEN THANK YOU SIR I HAD THANK YOU THINK CHAU MAKE IT QUICK. ARMED AYE DISTRICT FOR THE RECORD I AGREED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED IN THIS COMMITTEES ANALYSIS ASSEMBLY LOCAL GOVERNMENT [inaudible] COMMITTEE [inaudible] ARM [inaudible] AND THESE WERE THE FRAMEWORK OF THIS BILL. IS THAT IT DURING THE DROUGHT MANY LOW INCOME COMMITTEES ACROSS THE STATE. RELIED ON FAILED WATER SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE UNSAFE AND BUT LIABLE DRINKING WATER SO THROUGH A SERIES OF IT ISSUES THE THE STATE INITIALLY IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH S. B. FIVE FIVE TWO BY SENATOR WALK. AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY IN THE BUDGET BILL S. B. EIGHTY EIGHT WITH MISTER LENO. ALLOW THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO LOOKED CONSOLIDATIONS OF THE SMALLER DISTRICTS IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY ON THE WATER SUPPLY SIDE TO HELP FOLKS. NOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE WITNESSES IS TO EXTEND THAT SAME PHILOSOPHY. TO OF FOR FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO ALLOW THAT THE BOARD TO EXTEND THIS WITH RESPECT TO WASTE WATER SERVICES SIMILAR KINDS OF CHALLENGES ALTERNATE OVER THE WITNESSES. WILL ANSWER THE QUESTIONS BUT WE HAVE RICHARD TRANSLATE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. I LOVE WHEN I SEVENTH ME NUMBERS LIKE MINDED YOU'LL BE ONE AND CLEANED ALL THE FACE NO. MIKO MONEY THAT IS CHEN GUNS A STABLE SINGLE CLASS OF THE LAST TWO THAT THE PHRASE NO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MONDAY AGO SOMEONE I LIVE IN FRESNO COUNTY COMMUNITY OF JANE ADAMS JUST FIVE HOUSES FROM THE CITY OF FRESNO. BANGLA THANK AYE SAID BECAUSE EBOOK ONE LEVEL UNDER CANONICAL'S FEE OF THE QUE LA WAKSAL'S HE ADVOCATE IF ELECT CASA. OAKLAND THUMBING ITS WAY -- TO AYE RELY ON A SEPTIC TANK AND I LIVE WITH THE THE ANGUISHED ANXIETY THAT DIRTY WATER WILL RETURN TO MY HOME OR CONTAMINATE THE SOIL AROUND MY HOUSE. GET AGREEMENT THAT MET LAST TO THAT FATAL MOST BORN AND NOT THE% SCHOOL IDOL SCHOOLS BOTH YOU'RE STUCK Y. LAS MILLIONTH. I'D LIKE TO CONNECT TO THE CITY BUT THEY PUT VERY HIGH COSTS AND OBSTACLES IN OUR WAY. BUT FROM WHAT UP AGAIN EXCEPT REPLACE THAT BUT US THAT WOULD. GET THOUGHT MICHAEL MONEY THAT. IS THE FEDERAL OF AND PLEASE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COMMUNITY AND OTHERS LIKE IT ARE HEALTHY IT'S VERY -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MIKE CLAIBORNE I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF SB -- TWELVE FIFTEEN MARIA'S EXPERIENCE IS REALLY EMBLEMATIC OF THE WASTE WATER PROBLEMS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND EAST COACHELLA VALLEY AND REALLY THE STATE -- THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF SITES AT NEIGHBORHOODS AND SYSTEMS IN THE STATE THAT RELY ON FAILING SEPTIC SYSTEMS. THIS IS BOTH A THREAT TO WATER QUALITY -- NITRATES GETTING THE GROUND WATER -- AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE AND THEN THE BACTERIA THAT GETS IN THE SOIL FROM FAILING UMP SEPTIC TANKS -- SO. WE RECENTLY TOOK TO THE TWO SEPARATE SOIL SAMPLES AND THE COMMUNITY OF DEL AYE. AYE NEAR SEPTIC TANKS AND THEY ACTUALLY THE YARDS LOOKED OKAY AND EVERYTHING -- BUT THOSE SOIL SAMPLES CAME BACK POSITIVE -- FOR SEVERAL TYPES OF BACTERIA AND INCLUDING LISTERIA -- BACTERIA THESE ARE SEPTIC TANKS RIGHT BY THE FRONT DOORS OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES -- AND THEIR KIDS PLAYING IN ONE OF THE YARDS RIGHT WHEN WE TOOK THE SOIL SAMPLES -- SO THERE'S REALLY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD AND AT A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT WE SHOULD REALLY WRITE RESOLVE. THEIR BARRIERS IN PLACE THAT MAKE -- EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE IN THIS AREA MORE DIFFICULT -- THERE'S OFTENTIMES FUNDING FOR THESE PROJECTS -- THAT MY ORGANIZATION WORKS ON BUT THEY'RE OFTEN POLITICAL BARRIERS TO GETTING THE PROJECTS DONE -- IF YOU LOOK AND WALK THROUGH OUR DRIVE THROUGH DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. YOU'LL OFTEN SEE PATCHES OF GREEN GRASS AND A DRY YARD THAT'S KIND OF A SQUARE SHAPE. OFTEN THAT MEANS THAT THE SEPTIC TANK IN THAT YARD IS FAILING IF YOU DRIVE THROUGH THE IT'S NOT COMMUNITIES THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY COMMON EXPERIENCE -- SO THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS BILL I THINK IS THE WAY TO DO IT SO I'D ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANKS [inaudible] THANK YOU. FROM OTHER WITNESSES IN SPORT ALOE WE HAVE A GREAT WITNESS COMING OUT. THERE IS A MICROPHONE THERE THAT'LL YEAH THAT'S IT. WAYNE HI MY NAME IS DIANA AND I LIVE IN FRESNO AND I GO TO BORDER TOWN. PLEASE SUPPORT DISPEL SO WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY NEIGHBORHOOD THANK YOU. MANY METALLICS LEON WE HAVE THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. HI JUSTIN MASSEY WITH COMMUNITY WATER CENTER AND SUPPORT. ANDREA VENTURE WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION IN SUPPORT [inaudible] VERY GOOD -- LET'S SEE. DID THAT I CHAINED AS FOR OPPOSITION BUT FOR ANYONE WANTS TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. TRAINER -- YOU'RE YOU'RE WELCOME. TO TO STATE YOUR CONCERN WHY DON'T YOU IF YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN YOU CAN SIT DOWN IF YOU WANT TO STAND YOU COULD STAND [inaudible] OKAY. AND WILL CERTAINLY BE GLAD TO LISTEN TO WHATEVER YOUR CONCERTS ARE -- MARIANNE WARMER DOWN DRUG COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES THE ALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THIS. AND OUT WE JUST WERE I WANT TO BE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL. A ONE ALSO START OUT BY SAYING WE REALLY APPRECIATES A CENTER HERTZBERG BRING THIS FORWARD. THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE MIRROR IMAGE OF A COUPLE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON HAVING TO DO WITH SAFE DRINKING WATER. ON THAT SENATOR MONNING HAS PUT FORWARD AND WE BELIEVE THIS -- THAT THE PROVISION OF WATER TREATMENT AT THAT BACKEND AS IT WERE. HAS SOME OF THE SAME CHALLENGES. NAMELY OF FINDING THE FUNDING THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS MADE AVAILABLE. AND THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND EXISTING SYSTEMS AND EQUITABLY DISTRIBUTE THE COST OF THAT. NEW [inaudible] CAPACITY SO WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT SENATOR HERTZBERG IST IS TRYING TO GET TO IS UNNECESSARY. ASPECT OF PROVIDING A COMPLETE AND SAFE WATER DRINKING SYSTEM. PARTICULARLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MANY OF THEM ARE IN OUR COUNTIES SOARED BARELY KEENLY AWARE OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT APPROACH AND I WOULD CONCUR WITH SOME OF THE ITEMS RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS AND WE'D BE VERY HAPPY. PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT GET TO SOME OF THE MECHANICS OF PROVIDING THEM FUNDING TO MAKE THESE. NEW SYSTEMS COME ALIVE FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JUST CUT GALLAGHER AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE A OF AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE I'M BROUGHT FORWARD. I AM HERE TODAY NOT IN OPPOSITION BUT TO JUST RESPECTFULLY EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AS AMENDED -- ON FRIDAY SO WE'RE STILL SORTING THROUGH A SORT OF HOW THOSE. AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO IMPACT WASTE WATER AGENCIES BUT THERE ARE A FEW SPECIFIC COMPONENT THAT ARE PARTICULARLY AND DIFFICULT FOR US AND THESE INCLUDE THE NEW LANGUAGE -- THAT ALLOWS THE REGIONAL BOARD TO ORDER AN EXTENSION OF SERVICE WITH ACCESS CAPACITY AND THEN. GIVE THE STATE BOARD THE RIGHTS TO THAT ACCESS CAPACITY FOR FIVE YEARS AND THAT'S AT WITHOUT PAYING THE CONNECTION FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY -- WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A LOCAL AGENCIES DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WITH -- THE NEW AMENDMENTS AND DON'T NEED TO GET INTO THE DETAILS THERE BUT I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF WERE WHAT WORK. FISCAL SENSE -- ME NOTE THAT AND THE POLICY HAMBURG OUTLINED IN THE BILL SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AS TO WHETHER IT'S A BINDING REGULATORY DOCUMENT OR IF IT'S MORE OF A FLEXIBLE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT AND THEN -- WE JUST HAVE SOME PRACTICAL CONCERNS. WITH HOW THIS PROCESS WOULD WORK KIND OF ON THE GROUND -- IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WOULD DETERMINE THE COST OF INTERCONNECTION WHETHER THAT. YOU NOW -- OTHER THINGS LIKE WHETHER THE FEES ARE REASONABLE. WHAT FORM THE REASON REGIONAL BOARDS ORDER WOULD TAKE -- SO YOU KNOW IS THIS IN FORSMAN ORDER AGAINST A LOCAL AGENCY WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE -- SINCE WE HAVEN'T HAD A WATER QUALITY VIOLATION IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE I IT'S ALSO UNCLEAR HOW THESE ACTIONS WOULD WORK WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES SO. IN SOME CASES THE NEAREST ADJACENT LOCAL SYSTEM WOULD BE LIKE A CITY. ARE OWNED AND OPERATED COLLECTIONS SYSTEM BUT THEN AND THERE WOULD BE AN A LARGER REGIONAL ENTITY WHO WOULD NEED TO IT AND MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT. DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS TREATMENT CAPACITY AND AND THAT CONNECTION FEES AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO ON YOU KNOW DOES THE ORDER APPLY TO BOTH ENTITIES ITS KIND OF UNCLEAR IN THE LANGUAGE CURRENTLY SO. AND SOME OVERARCHING ISSUES THAT. ABOUT WE'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE STRONGER LANGUAGE ON THE SERVICE EXTENSIONS BEING COMPLAIN WITH PROP. TWO EIGHTEEN AND THE ADEQUATE FINANCING BE SECURED PRIOR TO ANY EXTENSIONS BEING ORDERED AND THEN -- FOR THE CLARITY ON THE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES THAT THE BILL'S TARGETING SO. I DO JUST WANNA KNOW. SOMEONE RC RC THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT OBJECTING IN ANY WAY TO FINDING SOLUTION UP THE FINDING A SOLUTION FOR THESE COMMUNITIES WITH FEELING SEPTIC SYSTEMS WE CERTAINLY EMPATHIZE SYMPATHIZE WITH THESE SITUATIONS AND OUR MEMBERS EXIST TO PROTECT WATER QUALITY IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SO. OF WE WE DO WANT TO SEE THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM REFLECT A REASONABLE AND WORKABLE OF PROCESS AND UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY. DOESN'T QUITE FIT THERE FOR US SO -- WITH THAT WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR COMMENTS AND WERE OPENED TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION WITH UNDER HERTZBERG GONNA STAFF. AND YOUR COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. EXCELLENT THANK YOU. THE SECOND SET. GOD THAT'S RIGHT I CAN THAT STORY DONE. GREAT OKAY THANK YOU OKAY GOD [inaudible] A SO WE HAVE. WHERE ARE WE NOW WE'VE OWE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION? I SHOULD PERHAPS SAY YOU WORKED SO MUCH IN OPPOSITION IS AS TRYING -- TO MAKE CONSTRUCTIVE COMMENTS THANK YOU [inaudible] ARM. LET'S SEE ARE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. UP MR MATHIS THANK YOU SO. THEY A OF COUNTY COMMENT ON THIS BECAUSE MY DISTRICT WAS. THE EPICENTER OF OF THE DROUGHT AND EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED AND IS ONE OF THE UNFORTUNATE EPICENTERS OF A LOT OF VERY BAD WATER -- TO I DO APPRECIATE -- THE WITNESS COMING FORWARD I I KNOW I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL TOURS IN THE DISTRICT. I AM LOOKING AT THIS THAT THIS IS PART OF WHY WE DID AND MY THE LAST YEAR -- AB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHICH WAS THE WATER AND WASTEWATER LOAN AND GRANT PROGRAM. DO LOW INTEREST LOANS AND GRANTS FOR TYING IN INCLUDING SEPTIC. ARMS I BELIEVE THE WAY WE WROTE THAT LAST YEAR. WOULD BE ABLE. TO TIE IN SOME OF THE FUNDING. FOR TIENEN THE SYSTEMS. NOT AT LEAST FROM THE RESIDENCE. INTO THE INFRASTRUCTURE I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE CONCERNS OBVIOUSLY. NOW WITH ROLL COUNTERS AND IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES WE DEALT WITH. PORTABLE WAS WE HAD COUNTY PROPERTIES. THAT HAD TO GET [inaudible] EXISTING LINES CONNECTED BETWEEN THE CITY OUT TO COUNTY OF LANDS. IN AN ANNEX PROCESS -- THE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND SOME HEARTBURN THEIR ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTIES -- ON WHO'S LIABLE IN IN FOR DOING THESE THINGS FOR THE FACT IS THEY HAVE TO GET DONE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF DOING THAT -- SENATE LOVES TALKING MORE IN IN THE DAY AGAIN ON HOW. ON TWO SEVEN SEVEN OF I KNOW THE GOVERNOR PUT MONEY IN THAT PROGRAM THIS YEAR WITHIN THE BUDGET. HOBBES I KNOW THE MONEY IS THERE THE IN THAT SRT PASSED THROUGH. STILL I LOVES HOCKEY MORE AND POSSIBLY TALK AS COMING ON AS A CO AUTHOR OF WE FEEL IF YOU WANT BECAUSE WILL LET'S LET'S TALK -- LATER IN IN GO OVER A FEW THINGS IN AND MAKE SURE OF MY RURAL COUNTIES ARE PROTECTED AS WELL BUT BUT I DO LIKE WE'RE GOING THIS IS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY NEEDED -- BLACK AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THAT'S BOTHERING ME RIGHT NOW IS I HAVE A LOT OF AG GUYS THAT ARE GETTING HIT -- FOR ME BEING ACCUSED OF CONTAMINATION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF WHAT'S KNOWN AS LEGACY ISSUES. ARE DUE TO SEPTIC TANKS -- THAT ARE FLOATING OUT THERE AS WELL. SO WHAT I'M HOPING NOW SOME OF THIS MIGHT HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THAT AS WELL. SELECT FLORIDA TALKING WITH YOU AND SEEING HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS YEAH THANK YOU INSTANT MATHIS YOU KNOW I I AM THIS IS NOT SOMETHING IS A COUPLE SMALL PARTS MIGHT THE COMMITTEES ARE REPRESENT THAT THIS INCLUDES BUT IS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT OVERSEES WATER I'M. TRY TO TAKE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW. FROM STORM WATER TO RECYCLE WATER TO THE ISSUES WE JUST SAW THE LEGISLATION WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN FRIEDMAN THAT WE JUST PASSED. DEALING WITH EFFICIENCY AND TRYING TO KIND OF RE ENGINEER IF YOU WILL SOME OF THE LARGER PROBLEMS BEEN. WITH WITH MR MINING WITH RESPECT TO HIS ISSUE I KNOW THAT THESE ARE CHALLENGING BUT BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS THAT IS THAT WE'VE GOT TO RE ENGINEER HOW WE DEAL WITH WATER ON THE ONE HAND INTO WE'VE GOT THAT FOOD FUNDAMENTALLY DEAL WITH THE LARGER ISSUE OF MORE. WAS A THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN AND THESE ARE THE KINDS OF CHALLENGES WE GOT A YOU KNOW COME TO IT AND GET IT FIXED IN YOUR UNFORTUNATELY IN AN AREA THAT SO DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED SO. YOU KNOW OFTEN WE DO MATTERS AND WILL ONLY WITH THEIR OWN DISTRICT I WORK ON MATTERS THAT TRIDENT LOOK AT THE BROADER PUBLIC POLICY SO I DON'T SHOULD BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU THAT ABSOLUTELY AND I ALSO HAVE A A CA TWENTY EIGHT THAT'S TALKING ABOUT A FUNDING. SOLUTIONS WHILE GOING ABOUT THAT MUCH TIME. THANK YOU CERTAINLY MEMBER -- OTHERS WITH QUESTIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATORS RATIONAL THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. SO ARM FIRST OF ALL THANKS TO ALL THE WITNESSES -- FOR COMING FORWARD AND AND AND DISCUSSING THEIR CONCERNS AND SUPPORT [inaudible] ARM.
