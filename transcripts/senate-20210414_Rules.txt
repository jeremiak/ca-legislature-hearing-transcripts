ALTHOUGH MY GREATEST MENTORS FOR MY LOVING PARENTS. WHO UNFORTUNATELY HAVE PASSED I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. WITHOUT THE VALUES OF HONESTY INTEGRITY HARD WORK THEY INSTILLED IN ME AT A YOUNG AGE. WITNESSING MY MOTHER'S RESILIENCE MY FATHER'S DEDICATION ABOUT ALWAYS DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR OUR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD NOT BE. FOR YOU TODAY AS THE FIRST FEMALE SECRETARY IF IT WASN'T FOR THE GENERATION OF STRONG FEMALE LEADERS IN THIS DEPARTMENT SUCH AS CHERYL PILAR SUSAN HUBBARD. KATHLEEN MENDOZA POWERS JUST TO NAME A FEW- DIRECTLY IMPACTED MY FROM. WHEN YOU ARE ALL PART OF MY SUPPORT NETWORK TODAY. THEY TAUGHT ME TO LEAD WITH STRENGTH AND GRACE. GROWING UP IN THIS AGENCY HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN AND OF ITSELF. BUT AS A WOMAN IN A PREDOMINANTLY MALE ENVIRONMENT. I UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY A DIVERSE WORKFORCE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE FOR ALL WITHIN CDCR. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY RESPECT AND APPRECIATION TO MY C. D. C. R. TEAM FOR THEIR ENORMOUS HARD WORK AND DEDICATION. IN MAKING CDC ARE DEPARTMENT OF INTEGRITY WHO BELIEVES IN THE CORE MISSION. A REHABILITATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY I COULD NOT BE PROUDER OR MORE GRATEFUL TO ALL OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS. CAME TO WORK EVERY DAY DURING THE PET PANDEMIC DESPITE THE REST OF THEIR OWN. HEALTH AND WELL BEING. LASTLY I WANT TO EPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM FOR HIS CONFIDENCE IN APPOINTING ME TO THIS POSITION. AS YOU KNOW I HAVE A DIVERSE BACKGROUND STARTING AS A MEDICAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WHICH IS A NURSE WITH PEACE OFFICER STATUS. BUT A DIRECT PATIENT CARE FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF MY CAREER. FOLLOWED BY A SUPERVISORY ROLE IN HEALTH CARE. FOR SEVERAL YEARS. I TOOK ON THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY RESOURCE MANAGER AT AN INSTITUTION WHICH AFFORD ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SUPERVISE RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS. OUR PROGRAMS VARIOUS- VISITOR PROGRAMS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMING. I WAS ABLE TO SEE FIRSTHAND THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT OF PROGRAMS TO THE POPULATION. I LOVE THE JOB SO MUCH I ACTUALLY GAVE UP MY PEACE OFFICER STATUS FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO I COULD REMAIN IN THAT CAPACITY. ULTIMATELY RETURNING BACK TO HEALTHCARE IS A HEALTHCARE ADMINISTRATOR TO LEAD AN INSTITUTION CRISIS. UNTIL RETURNING TO ACOSTA ROLE SERVING AS ASSOCIATE WARDEN THREE WHARTON AND EVENTUALLY SERVING IN VARIOUS POSITIONS NCDC OUR HEADQUARTERS TO INCLUDE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR UNDER PROGRAMS. LAST HOUSING GAP IN DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES SUPPORT. AFTER RESULT INSTITUTIONS AND UNDERSECRETARY OF OPERATIONS OVER A NINE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. MY NURSING DEGREE AND MY PASSION FOR TREATING OUR POPULATION. IS NOT DISSIPATED WITH THE VARIOUS CHANGES IN CLASSIFICATION. I TOOK ON THIS CHALLENGING ROLE IN MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. BECAUSE I BELIEVED I COULD LEAD FROM A PERSPECTIVE CARE AND TREATMENT. FOR THOSE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN OUR FACILITIES. AS YOU KNOW CONGRESS YES YOU SEE ARE VERY HARD. WITH OVER FORTY NINE THOUSAND CASES AMONGST THE POPULATION AND OVER SIXTEEN THOUSAND CASES MARKS ARE STAFF. TODAY WE HAVE SIXTEEN ACTIVE CASES MARKS POPULATION AND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE CASES WITH OUR STAFF. CERTAINLY SADDENS ME TO SAY WE LOST. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE PATIENTS AT TWENTY SIX STAFF. FORTUNATELY WE BELIEVE WE'VE TURNED THE CORNER AND COATED WE HAVE OFFERED VACCINES 291% OF THE POPULATION AND HAVE BOXING NAY DID OVER SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND- PATIENTS. WITH THE FIRST JONES AND OVER TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND STAFF. THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN HARD ON EVERYONE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. BUT FOR ALL OF US WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAINTAIN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR FAMILIES AND OUR SUPPORT NETWORK. ASSEMBLY NOT LOST ON ME THAT THE POPULATION DID NOT HAVE THAT SAME. OPPORTUNITY DUE TO THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS- WE HAD TO GO. TO TAKEN KOVIC FAMILY VISITATION- WAS SUSPENDED. I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE THAT LAST WEEK AND WE OPEN UP IN PERSON VISITATION FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER A YEAR. THE NEW PROCESS ALL THE MORE STRINGENT SAFETY GUIDELINES WERE RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY. HOWEVER DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS OR FEWER VISITORS THAN NORMAL. THAT DIDN'T STOP THE SMILES AND JOY IS ON EVERYONE'S FACES YOU COULD EVEN SEE IT THROUGH THE MASS I PERSONALLY TOWARDS U. S. P. SACRAMENTO ON VISITATION DAY. AND MY HEART WAS WARM SEEING THAT BEGINNING OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION OUR POPULATION. REHABILITATION IS OUR MISSION AND FAMILY VISITS ARE THE CORE REHABILITATION. IN THE WEEKS TO COME WE WILL WORK WITH OUR HEALTHCARE PARTNERS TO BRING CHILDREN BACK TOWARDS DOING ROUNDS. THE POPULATION HAS BEEN EXTREMELY UNDERSTANDING OVER THE LAST YEAR AND EVERYBODY'S LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BACK TO PROGRAMMING WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. IN MY OVER THIRTY THREE YEAR SERVICES YOU SEE ARE I'VE SEEN THIS AGENCY INVOLVED OVER THE YEARS. FROM THE PRIMARY MISSION OF HOUSING TO MISSION OF REHABILITATION AND A REAL LIFE IMPACT AWAY. I WITNESSED FIRST HAND HOW VARIOUS CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS HAVE INSPIRED HOPE WITHIN THE POPULATION. IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE THE MOTIVATION AND DESIRE. OF OUR POPULATION TO CHANGE OUR LIVES. WITH THE VARIOUS PROGRAMMING OPPORTUNITIES. KNOWING THAT HARD WORK AND POSITIVE BEHAVIOR MOST WILL GET A SECOND CHANCE. THE SUPPORT OF CCAR'S PROGRAMS WILL REMAIN THE KEY FOR SUCCESS OF THIS AGENCY AS WELL AS OUR RETURN CITIZENS. OVER THE YEARS SERVING COUNTLESS IMPROVEMENTS TO THE AGENCY STRUCTURE THERE'S UNDOUBTEDLY MOVE FOR. ROME FOR MORE. IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH TECHNOLOGY TRAINING AND IMPROVEMENTS CHANGE% INSTITUTIONAL BUYER MEANT FOR THE LIVES AND WELL BEING OF OUR POPULATION STAFF. WE MUST CONTINUE TO REIMAGINE CBC ARE IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES BY CREATING A CULTURE OF REHABILITATION AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. THE DUTIES AS SECRETARY I HAVE PUSH FOR EQUITY AND DIVERSITY WITHIN CDCR. I GATHER SEVERAL JUST THE DIVISIONS WORKING COLLECTIVELY ON THIS GOAL SHOULD AS WE WORK TO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIVERSE WORK FOR. FOR SEASON THREE. DEVERS WORKFORCE. THE GOVERNMENT ALLIANCE ARE RAISING EQUITY STEERING COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WORKING EFFORTLESSLY TO RAISE AWARENESS. UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS OF A DIVERSE WORK. AS THE FIRST FEMALE SECRETARY FOR CDC ARE I REALIZE I HAVE AN INTENTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THIS AGENCY. THAT IS INCLUSIVE OF ALL AND BREAKS DOWN THE BARRIERS ALONG THE WAY I MUST BUILD A SUSTAINABLE PROCESS TO ENSURE ONGOING INCLUSIVENESS. AND I INTEND TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY. IN MY TIME AS YOU ARE THE POPULATION GROW FROM FORTY THOUSAND TO OUR HIGHEST ABOUT HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND. TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH APPROXIMATELY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND- HOUSE WITHIN OUR- INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY FACILITIES. DO NOT SUBSTANTIALLY. OVER THE YEARS DUE TO VERY AS- STATE LEGISLATION VOTER INITIATIVES FEDERAL COURT ORDERS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THIS AND- AS A RESULT. ALL THE DECLINE IN POPULATIONS WE HAD TO MAKE THE DIFFICULT DECISION. RELATED TO PRISON CLOSURE. WE RECENTLY HAD TO ANNOUNCE THE CLOSURE OF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER SUSANVILLE. AS WELL AS THE CLOSURE OF ONE SECURE LEVEL ONE FACILITY A CORRECTIONAL TRAINING FACILITY AT SALT ACT. ACTIONAL SKEWS ME CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AT TO HATCH. BUT JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THESE ARE AN ADDITIONAL TO THE DOOR VOCATIONAL INSTITUTE WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED IN SEPTEMBER AND WILL CLOSE IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. I WILL LEAD THIS AGENCY WERE ST CITY AND WITH SENSITIVITY AND COMPASSION. AS WE CLOSE THESE INSTITUTIONS MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF OUR STAFF AS WELL AS THE POPULATION DURING THIS TIME OF THE ADJUSTMENT AND TRANSITION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON STOCK WELLNESS UNDERSTAND THESE THESE JOBS ARE STRESSFUL. OUR STAFF NEED OUR SUPPORT. EVEN MORE SO IN THE SPACE IN ON CERTAIN SHE IS UNCERTAIN TIMES I WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES OF STATE LEGISLATION AND VOTER INITIATIVES. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THIS AGENCY. I'M HUMBLED AND HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION. SECRETARY THANK YOU- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND GO TO MY COLLEAGUES AND GIVEN THAT WE HAVE IT AND ONE COLLEAGUE THAT IS ON TO COMMITTEES- RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO START WITH US SENATOR GROVE TO MAKE SURE SHE HAS A CHANCE TO. ASK HER QUESTIONS TO MAKE HER COMMENTS SENATOR GROWTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM AND- THANK YOU- MISS ALLISON FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK YOU THESE QUESTIONS- MYSELF. CENTER DOLLY AND- SENATOR CAFIERO- READ YOUR PRESS RELEASE LAST NIGHT. WE CALLED OUR PRISON SYSTEMS THE WARDENS ARE CITY MANAGERS OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND NO ONE KNEW ABOUT THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. TO CLOSE THESE FACILITIES IN OUR DISTRICTS- I THINK THAT- ALL OF US EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ON DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF DECENCY AND RESPECT. THAT AND IF THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT CLOSING FACILITIES THAN- WE SHOULD AT LEAST BE SOMEWHAT NOTIFIED IN SOME TYPE OF ADVANCE ORDER. AND I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT SPECIFIC SUBJECT THAT'S OKAY. OKAY SO THE WHEN I SERVED IN THE ASSEMBLY AND PART OF THIS A SMALL FOR VERY SMALL SHORT TIME IN THE SENATE I WORKED ON- BUDGETS THAT DEALT WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS- PROGRAMS WERE BEING DOWNSIZED AND CLOSED. THEY HAD A PLAN IN PLACE AND- THEY HAD- IN EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM THEY PUT A PLAN TOGETHER THEY DID AN EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM FOR DISPLACED STAFF THEY CONFERRED WITH COUNTY GOVERNMENT IN CITY GOVERNMENT IN THE CITIES WHERE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WERE LOCATED BECAUSE- THERE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE AN IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF JOB CLOSURES. IN THEIR DISK IN THESE AREAS. THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE PUBLIC HEARING SO THAT THE HE- PUBLIC COULD BE AWARE. OF THAT THE CLOSURE OF THESE FACILITIES. THEY ACTUALLY HAD TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT INCLUDE A DESCRIPTION OF THE STAKEHOLDER IMPACT INCLUDING THE DESCRIPTION OF LOCAL ISSUES CONCERNS RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE PROPOSED CLOSURES. AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF THE PROPERTY. AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW THE IMPACT ON RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES THE RESIDENT PLACEMENT WHERE WOULD THEY GO THE DESCRIPTION OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISPLACED EMPLOYEES. AND THE FISCAL IMPACT OF CLOSURE SPECIFICALLY ON THE AREA AND A TIME LINE FOR THAT CLOSURE- AND- THAT'S A- A FAR CRY FROM WHAT WE JUST EXPERIENCED WITH CDC ARE SO AS SOME AND I'M NOT. I KNOW THAT YOU'VE ONLY BEEN IN CHARGE FOR JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME. BUT CAN YOU TELL ME HOW YOU'RE GOING TO ADDRESS THIS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU MA'AM I WILL SAY GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM DID HIGHLIGHTS THE TO PRISON CLOSURES IN HIS TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- AND THEN OF COURSE WE ARE FOLLOWING OURTHE PENAL CODE GUIDANCE- AS IT RELATES TO FACILITIES CLOSURES. SO WE HAD VERY AS- AND NOW SPENDS OF CLOSURES IN THE PAST AND HAD NOT ACTUALLY COMPLETED THOSE FOR VARIETY OF REASONS MOST OF THEM POPULATION PRESSURES. I WILL SAY OUR POPULATION IS DOWN AS FAR AS I HIGHLIGHTED YOU HAVE- YOU KNOW NINETY FIVE THOUSAND. I THE REASON FIRST SOME OF THE REASONS FOR THE SELECTIONS OF A PARTICULAR FACILITY AND THAT THE PRIORITIZE FOR CLOSURE IS THE COST TO OPERATE A FACILITY. THE CURRENT CAPACITY. IMPRACTICAL ON THE WORK FORCE. THE HOUSING NEEDS- WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A GENDER RESPONSIVE NEEDS- WHETHER WE NEED WHATEVER TYPES OF FACILITIES THAT WE NEED A LONG TERM INVESTMENT IN THE FACILITY- AS WELL AS PUBLIC PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE DURATION OF THE STATE'S SOLUTION FOR OVERCROWDING. SO HOW DO I SAY THIS AND I CERTAINLY WILL LOOK AT WHICH YOU BROUGHT UP AS FAR AS HOW OTHER AGENCIES HAVE DONE THAT'S- TYPICALLY- THESE THESE THINGS ARE KEPT VERY CONFIDENTIAL UNTIL THE VERY END. WHEN WE GO TO ANNOUNCERS NAMES HIGHER UPS UNIFICATION PLAN THAT HAS WORKED OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CALLING I PERSONALLY CALLED THE SHERIFF I CALLED THE WARDEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE UNDERSECRETARY. OF OPERATIONS PHYSICALLY BEAR YESTERDAY TO TELL THE STAFF FIRST THING IN THE MORNING- WE DID THE SAME THING FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF DVI SECRETARY DS PHYSICALLY WAS THERE I WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE YESTERDAY MYSELF HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR HEARING TO DAY- IT'S CERTAINLY NOT LOST ON ME IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOR THE STAFF. I WILL SAY THROUGH THE VOLUNTARY TRANSFER PROCESS FOR THE STAFF AT DVI- ALL WERE WORRIED THAT THE STAGES OF GETTING THAT FINALIZED BURKE. TO MY KNOWLEDGE WAS EVER SINGLE STAFF HAS HOW HAS A PLACE TO LAND- YOU KNOW ANOTHER INSTITUTION WE HAD NUMEROUS VACANCIES. IN THE STATE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS MADE. WORDS CC HAS FIFTY PER COUPON. I AND SO ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. TO HATCH A P. IS 47% CAPACITY ON THEIR END AND WHEN I STATE TO HATCH A P. IT'S JUST OUR SECURE LEVEL ONCE WAS ONE YARD WITH IN THE INSTITUTION OF VARIOUS ARMS I THINK THEY HAVE FOR FINE. AND THE SAME CTF IS THAT 61% EMPHATIC. THANK I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE HOLD ON JUST A SECOND LET US MAKE SURE WE'VE GOT THAT COVERED. HOW'S THAT IS THAT SOUND OKAY NOW WE'RE GOOD OKAY. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND TECHNOLOGY HI AGAIN I JUST WANT EXPRESSED MY CONCERN- FOR THE WARDEN KATE'S INTACT TO BE THERE'S THREE OR FOUR INMATES IN SEVENTY FOUR STAFF. HE FOUND OUT. A THIS MORNING. I FOUND OUT BECAUSE OF MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ME TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SUSANVILLE CLOSURE IN HIS DISTRICT WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN HIS DISTRICT. AND QUITE IRONICALLY IT'S WHERE YOU TRAIN ALL THAT INMATE- OR INCARCERATED FIREFIGHTERS. IN A FIRE PRONE AREA IN FIRE SEASON WHICH WE DEAL WITH- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THAT FACILITY IS CLOSING- AND THEN AS I READ THE PRESS RELEASE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO IT I NOTICED THAT THEY HAD TO BE WAS THERE AND I NOTICED THAT- SOLEDAD WAS THERE. AND SO I AM TEXANA CABALLERO INTO HAD NO IDEA EITHER I JUST THINK THAT AND- THE WAY THAT YOU GUYS WENT ABOUT THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE AND I WANT- I REALLY DO WANT TO COMMITMENT FROM YOU THAT THAT THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY WON'T- CONTINUE IN THIS WAY. AND WE SHOULD LOOK AT MOVING FORWARD IN MODELING AT PRACTICES LIKE OTHER AGENCIES SO THAT THERE IS COMMUNITY INPUT I MEAN EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT SEVENTY FOUR STAFF AND- EVEN INTO HATCH BEER YOU LOOK AT SENATOR DOLLIES DISTRICT OR SENATOR COPIERS DISTRICT WAS SOLID AT. THERE'S IMPACTS ON OUR DISTRICTS THERE THESE PEOPLE OWN HOMES HAVE CARS AND HE YOU'RE GONNA TRANSFER INDUSTRY TO TRANSFER TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BUY OR CONSUME IN THESE AREAS. AND IT'S IMPACTFUL ON EACH ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS AND SO I'M ASKING FOR A COMMITMENT THAT THIS WILL BE FROM YOU THAT THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT OR AT LEAST DIFFERENTLY IN THE FUTURE- AND WE AS LEGISLATORS AND OUR COMMUNITIES WILL FIND OUT BECAUSE OF A PRESS RELEASE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE CLOSURE OF THE FACILITY. MA'AM I. THANK YOU- I PERSONALLY CALLED WARDEN SHEETS ON ON MONDAY AFTERNOON- AND I WILL SAY THAT- WE DID HAVE A COMMUNICATION PLAN IF THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE MISSED IN THAT COMMUNICATION PLAN BY VARIOUS DISTRICTS I WILL DEFINITELY BE ADDRESS MATCH AND I WILL WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AS FAR AS AN OVERALL PLAN- I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE OTHER STATE HOSPITALS- THE OTHER FACILITY I THINK WAS DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER SHE SAID. I THINK THAT WAS KIND OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT THEY WERE CLOSING SEVERAL FACILITIES- THERE ARE NO WEATHER FACILITIES PLANNED AT THIS TIME BUT WILL DEFINITELY TAKE ALL THAT INTO CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD SO THAT WE DO ADDRESS SOME CONCERNS I WILL SAY THAT WHENEVER WE HIGHLIGHT THAT YOU SOLD IS GOING TO CLOSE. WE ALMOST HAVE A MASS EXODUS OF STAFF AND I STILL HAVE TO OPERATE A FACILITY AND I IS. MANY OF YOU KNOW ON THIS. IN THIS COMMITTEE TODAY THAT WE'VE BEEN OUT C. R. C. R. CAL REAL BILL. CENTER FOR. NUMEROUS TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND WE NEVER CALL. BUT EVERY SINGLE TIME THAT WE'VE ANNOUNCED THAT. THEY THEY HAVE BEEN KIND OF SICK STRUGGLE WITH STAFFING. AND SO THAT'S OF REASON BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DO NEED TO WORK ON AND I LIKE I COMMIT YOU TO WORK WITH YOU WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION ON THE BEST PATH FORWARD. M. THANK YOU FOR THAT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR HIM AND MY COLLEAGUES SENATOR DOLLY. AND HE'S CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT CRITERIA DATA THAT USED TO MAKE THE CLOSURE DETERMINATION AND- WAS THERE EVEN AN ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY DONE ON HOW MUCH THE CLOSURE WILL AFFECT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY LOCAL BUSINESSES CURRENT EMPLOYEES IN THE PRISON IN SUSANVILLE. AND THE FACT THAT- THERE ARE HIGH PRONE WHILE AREA DEADLIEST FIRE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA PARADISES IN THAT COMMUNITY IN THAT AREA- I BELIEVE CAMPFIRE IS IN THAT AREA. AND THAT'S WHERE THE TRAIN INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT THESE FIRES IN THAT HIGH PRONE MOUNTAIN AREA- JUST- IT FOR REFERENCE I HAVE A BUSINESS IN A IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. AND IN WHEN THEY TRAIN THEY DO SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR SPECIFIC JOBS IF IT'S IN THE DESERT THEY TRAIN IN THE DESERT THEY DON'T TRAIN AT THE BEACH AND THEN GO PERFORMING THE DESERT. AND SO- THE TRAINING THAT'S OFFERED IN THIS COMMUNITY UP THERE IS A MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY. BECAUSE FIGHTING FIRES AND CLIMBING UP AND DOWN HILLS IS WAY DIFFERENT THAN FIGHTING FIRES ON A FLAT LANDSCAPE. AND SO COULD YOU ANSWER ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS PLEASE. YES MA'AM. A POINT OF CLARIFICATION OKAY SO ALL THE FIRE CAMPS WILL REMAIN INTACT- WITH THEIR SINGING STOCKING AND THE SAME POPULATION. THE FIRE TRAINING COMPONENT THAT IS CURRENTLY AT CCC WILL TRANSFER TO SIERRA CONSERVATION CENTER FOR THAT EXACT SAME TRAINS THEY ALREADY HAVE THE FACILITY THERE. THEY CURRENTLY TRAINED FIREFIGHTERS FOR THE SOMETHING RECHARGE NOW THEY WILL TRAINED FIREFIGHTERS FOR THE NORTHERN REGION- AND I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE YOU SAID ALL YOU ASKED ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT WE UTILIZE YES SO WE FOLLOWED CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY SIXTY SEVEN AND FIVE ZERO ZERO THREE POINT SEVEN WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE FOR CDC ARE FACILITIES FOR CLOSURE. THAT INCLUDES COST AND I THINK I'VE I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE RECOUP THE COSTS THE IMPACT OF THE CLOSURE OF THE WORK FORCE- AND I SAID ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS EARLIER BUT HE DID NOT INCLUDE- AND ACADEMIC- EXCUSE ME AND- ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT INCLUDED- IN. THAT PENAL CODE SECTION BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO EVALUATE WILL CERTAINLY NOT LOST ON ME THAT YOU KNOW. THE TWO PERSONS UP THERE AND SUSAN BELL IS THE PRIMARY EMPLOYERS. ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION AND FORCE FOR PICKING A LOCATION WHICH IS THE FACT THAT ANNUALLY WE HAVE TO SEND UP APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED NEW CADETS. UP TO THAT LOCATION I THINK IT'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EACH- AND SO IT'S LIKE A REVOLVING DOOR STAFF GO THERE. THEY DON'T WANT TO- STAY SO THEY LEAVE THEY THEY WAIT TO TIME DEVELOP LATERALLY TRANSFER CAL. THAT'S FOR THE- THE CUSTANCE OUT MAJORITY OF OUR NON CUTS TO STAFF ARE PRETTY- STATIONARY STAFF IN THE FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. I WILL SAY THAT OBVIOUSLY THESE NEGOTIATION PROCESS FOR ANY KIND- TRANSFER OR REAL. OF STAFF. BUT ONE OF MY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE TEAM THAT'S DEVELOPING THIS IS DEFINITELY AFFORD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE WHO ARE NOT FROM THAT COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFER OUT. SO THAT THE WHAT. ARE THE MEMBERS FROM THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN BORN AND RAISED IN DEDICATED THEIR LIVES. TO THIS DEPARTMENT. YOUR LIVE AND IN THE- KIDS GO TO SCHOOL AND THEY THEY DATA THEY DON'T A JOB RESIDENTS BUT THOSE ARE THE STAFF TO GET TO REMAIN PLANES. SO WE WILL WORK VERY VERY DILIGENTLY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE UNION NEGOTIATIONS TO GO THROUGH BUT WE DEFINITELY HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STAFF. ARE TAKEN CARE OF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE PROVIDE ALL THE FIRE SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE IN THAT AREA WITH OUR EXISTING WITH THE FIRE CAMP CENTER. OKAY I. THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF IS HAD YOU KNOW HAS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO RELOCATE AND GO TO A DIFFERENT JOB. BUT I ALSO WANT A COMMITMENT FROM YOU THAT. YOU KNOW THE IMPACTS ON THE COMMUNITY AND THE STAFF THAT LIVE UP THERE THEY BY LOCAL VEHICLES THEY BUY HOMES OR RENT HOMES THEY- SHOP AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE THEY SHOP AT THE LOCAL- CLOTHING STORE. AND THEY SUPPORT AND THE LOCAL LITTLE LEAGUE- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO AS A GOOD CITIZEN IN THE COMMUNITY. S. THESE INDIVIDUALS DO THAT AND SHUTTING DOWN THAT FACILITY- LOSING THE- LUMBER MILLS THAT HAVE BEEN UP THERE. IT'S DECIMATING THAT PART OF OUR STATE AND I JUST THINK OF THE STATE I MEAN WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL RIGHT AND IF THE STATE IS GOING TO HAVE. THESE CLOSURES THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME TYPE OF. PUBLIC INPUT FOR THESE BUSINESSES AND HEALTHIER AND THESE COMMUNITIES. ALL DISTRICTS ALL THEY'RE ALL TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE OF FOCUSED ON STAFF AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF IS COMMITTED TO THIS TYPE OF WORK HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO ANOTHER FACILITY AND CONTINUE THEIR CAREER- BUT WE ALSO. THESE CLOSURES. ABSOLUTELY MA'AM I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND ALMOST ALL OF OUR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE VERY FEW OF US ALL OF OUR PRISONS ARE IN REMOTE LOCATIONS AND THAT. YOU KNOW. I STARTED THIS BUSINESS IN AND WHEN THEY WERE BUILDING PRISONS ON EVERY CORNER AND I KNOW THE IMPACT THAT THE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ON OUR VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES- AND THE AND THE MANY COMPANY KIND OF CLOSURE ANNOUNCEMENT- THAT HAS A THIS VERY SPOT. OF SOMEBODY'S OUT AND ALSO PRISON MOST PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW ALLEN ALL. AND I WOULD EVERY TIME I GO ANYWAY AS MY NINE FIVE. I'M SORRY WHAT TYPE IT EVERY. EVERY TIME I'M MY WAY TO GO HOME AND I FOR. OKAY SO YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE I WOULD. YEAH I CERTAINLY. NOT LOST ON ME IF WE WERE TO LOSE THAT THE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY- AND SO WE CERTAINLY. WILL TAKE THAT- INTO CONSIDERATION. GOING FORWARD IT'S YOU KNOW IT. IS WE'RE WE'RE REALLY STUCK IN A IN A CONTACT POINT THREE HERE BECAUSE- OUR LARGER METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE TO RECRUIT STAFF. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO BIGGEST IMPACT WHERE MY MORE MORE LOCATIONS I HAD DIFFICULTY STAFFING. A SO YOU KNOW IT IT IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM. BUT I'M DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE IT SEAMLESS THANK YOU MA'AM I APPRECIATE THAT COMMITMENT. I ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS- FOR SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE RULES COMMITTEE- REPRESENTS ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES ON THE DECISIONS THAT ARE ARE MADE IN THIS IN THIS- COMMITTEE. SO ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUE THIS YEAR'S CENTRAL VALLEY IN KERN COUNTY WITH ME MISS HER TADO. AT THE CENTRAL VALLEY SHAFTER DELANO IN TAFT. ARE THESE GOING TO BE PERMANENT CLOSURES. I I'M SORRY I DON'T THINK I QUITE UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION. ARE THAT SHE'S ASKING IF THE OPERATIONS WITH THE LAST THREE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SHAFTER DELANO IN TAFT. SHE WANTS TO KNOW IF THESE ARE GONNA BE PERMANENT CLOSURES SO THERE. TEMPORARILY OR SUSPENDED OR WHATEVER THERE. THERE ARE NO ONE IN THESE FACILITIES AND- ARE THESE GOING TO BECOME PERMANENT CLOSURES. SO WE HAVE ANNOUNCED THOSE CLOSURES PREVIOUSLY DUE TO THE POPULATION REDUCTIONS. I WILL SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS THAT WE DID IN YEARS PAST AND SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF THOSE FACILITIES AND I DON'T KNOW THE NUANCES OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS I WOULD NOT WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY NOT IN NEED FOR THOSE FACILITIES WITHOUT POPULATION BEING- AND NOT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL POPULATIONS IN THE COUNTY JAILS BUT WE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS- AND SO AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT NEED THOSE FACILITIES. I SO I GUESS THE SECOND FOLLOW UP IS THAT YOU HAVE THESE FACILITIES HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED FOR CLOSURE THEY'VE BEEN CLOSE THERE'S NO PEOPLE IN THESE FACILITIES. AND THE CITY OF SHAFTER IN TAFT INCLUDING ARE STILL HAVING A COST OF A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO MAINTAIN THE EMPTY PRISON- BECAUSE OF THE LEASE. IS THERE ANY WAY THAT CDC ARE CAN BE A LITTLE CONGENIAL AND LET SOME OF THESE SERVICES CITIES AND COUNTIES OUT OF THESE LEASES. BECAUSE THE FACILITIES ARE EMPTY. AND THEN THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PAY THESE AND YOU KNOW THESE FEES AND MAINTAIN THESE FACILITIES WHEN YOU HAVE NO INTENTION OF OPENING THEM BACK UP. SO WE'VE BEEN THERE NUMEROUS NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CITY'S AND CONVERSATIONS- REGARDING THESE VERY SPECIFIC ISSUES I KNOW WE PAID OUR RESPONSE FOR THOSE FACILITIES ON IT AND I DON'T KNOW THE FREQUENCY NAME TO MR BARR CAN DRESS A LITTLE BETTER THAN I CAN. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO BASICALLY SUBLEASED SOME STRESS CELANESE- AND THEY COULD DO NOW I THANK REMEMBER THE TIME FRAME FOR THE CONTRACT. BUT THEY THEY COULD SUBLEASE THE SO. WITH X. ON CON IF THEY IF THEY NEED TO- I'M NOT I'M NOT DIRECTLY INVOLVED WITH ANY CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS IF THERE ARE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS GOING ON. WITH THOSE SPECIFIC FACILITIES- LIKE I SAID MAYBE THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY AND I JUST DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD EXACTLY. WHERE EVERYTHING HAS KIND OF. YOU KNOW LANDED WITH OUR CURRENT NEED FOR WITH OUR CURRENT NOT NEEDING NOW COUPLED WITH ANY LEGAL REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE LEAST BOND STUFF THAT IS REALLY STOPPED I OBVIOUSLY DON'T CLEARLY UNDERSTAND ALL THE NUANCES. THERE- BUT HOPEFULLY I CAN ANSWER I DO NOT. THINK THINKS JUST. TO RELEASE- OUT OF THOSE CON ON A SURE IS THAT SENATOR LET ME UP A PEN AND NECK- BECAUSE THE SECTOR. MAY ARE. MAYBE DIRECTOR OR BOARD YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION AND SHOULD THAT ALSO THEN LATER NOT BE ADEQUATE ENOUGH LET ME REFER TO STAFF THAT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS HERE ABOUT THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS- THAT AS IT RELATES TO THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES. AND WE WILL DRAFT A LETTER AND GET IT WE WILL EXPECTED WHAT FOLLOW UP ON THAT SO WE'LL PUT IT. YOU CAN ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN BUT SHOULD WE NOT GET AN ANSWER AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US WE WILL SEND A LETTER FROM RULES AS WE HAVE DONE- OTHER TIMES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET SOME RESPONSE ON ON THAT AND WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE- ON THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IS A SAID IN THIS IS ACTUALLY IN SENATOR HER TAUGHT US DISTRICTS AFTER BUT IT'S IN KERN COUNTY AS A COMMUNITY WE BOTH CARE ABOUT- YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THE CITY OF SHAFTER A SMALL. CITY IF I WAS TO TAKE A GUESS I WOULD PROBABLY SAY AND AGAIN IT'S A GUESTS BUT IT'S A PRETTY DARN GOOD WENT THAT IT SAID NINETY THREE OR NINETY FOUR PERCENT. OF LATINO- OF THE FARMING COMMUNITY IN THE SHAFTER AREA. IT IS- THIS OF SHAFTER THEY WERE TO TURN THIS pFACILITY IN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE AFTER IS ROUGHLY. MILE AWAY FROM SPELL. AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO THOSE CAN. MEMBERS HAVE DRIVE TO BAKER. OR TAFT IF THEY WANT TO GET ANY TYPE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND THEY COULD PUT THAT FACILITY TO GOOD USE. AND THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL PAYING A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE. THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO MAINTAIN A FACILITY THAT. IT APPEARS CDCR IS NOT EVER GOING TO OPEN BACK UP. SO IF YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT OR HAVE SOMEBODY REACH OUT AND THEN. THE SENATE PRO TEM HAS OCCURRED YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA HAVE STAFF ROOF YOU KNOW PUT THE LETTER TOGETHER REGARDING THE RULES AND HOW THAT WORKS BUT- SENATOR- HER TADO WOULD BE VERY GRATEFUL. IF YOU WOULD TO INFORM HER- ON THAT PROCESS BECAUSE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THAT AREA. ESPECIALLY WITH THE HIGH LATINO POPULATION. I WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THAT COMMUNITY. AND I THINK THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME. VENT. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU- AND WITH THAT I'M GOING TO GO TO SENATOR COME LONGER NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM HOTEL HOW ARE YOU DOING SECOND. FINDING YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING. GOOD AFTERNOON SO I ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- I THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO MEET WITH ME EARLIER TODAY THAT WAS- NICE WHEN WE FIRST MET IT ACTUALLY SOMETIME AGO IT WAS IN RESPONSE TO A HEARING THAT I HAD- ON. CONDITIONS THE CONDITIONS OF THE OUR WOMEN'S PRISONS. AND IN THAT HEARING WOMEN TALKED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO FILE GRIEVANCES HAVING THE GRIEVANCE PROCESS STALLED- BECAUSE OF COBIT POSSIBLY THEY TALKED ABOUT UNSANITARY UNSAFE CONDITIONS THEY TALKED ABOUT NEEDING TO USE THEIR OWN SANITARY NAPKINS AND PROVISIONS TO CLEAN THEIR CELLS TO CLEAN THEIR COVERT CELLS. THE CLEAN THE CELLS OF WOMEN WHO HAD CONTRACTED COBIT AND HAD BEEN MOVED- AND THAT THEY WERE GETTING NO SUPPORT FROM CDC ARE- I MENTION THIS CDCR STAFF DISMISSED AND DISPUTED THE CLAIMS- AND YET IN IN- IG REPORT- SPECIFIC TO THE GRIEVANCE PROCESSES. THE O.I. G. REPORT ACTUALLY FOUND THE CDC OURS IMPLEMENTATION OF THEIR STEPS MEANT TO IMPROVE THE HANDLING OF INCARCERATED PERSONS ALLEGATIONS OF STAFF MISCONDUCT FAILED AT BOTH FAIRNESS AND INDEPENDENCE SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR RESPONSE- TO THIS ISSUE AND I GUESS I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT I BELIEVE THE WOMEN. THANK THANK YOU MA'AM I WILL SAY THAT- OUR STAFF COMPLAINT PROCESS- THAT WAS MODIFIED LAST YEAR THAT WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY AND THEN FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY WAS EXTREMELY PROBLEMATIC- IT NEEDS MUCH IMPROVEMENT. NOW IT WAS A PROCESS THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THAT- WE MADE IT TOO COMPLEX SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY WITH THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AS WELL AS COURT EXPERTS TO REFINANCE PROCESS AS WE TAKE ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS OUT OF THE INSTITUTION. GO TO A CENTRALIZED SCREENING LOCATION OFF FOR PROCESSING AND ASSIGNMENTS WE WILL HAVE INDEPENDENT EVALUATORS EVALUATE MAJORITY OF THOSE- COMPLAINTS- SOME MAY RETURN THERE WILL BE IMPACT MATRIX AGREED UPON WITH THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL OF OURSELVES AND OUR COURT EXPERTS ON WHICH WHICH OF THESE GRIEVANCES MAY RETURN TO THE INSTITUTION. AT WHICH WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A LIEUTENANT AND WHICH WILL BE ASSIGNED TO A SPECIAL INVESTIGATOR THAT'S KIND OF WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF FINALIZING THOSE- AND THEN WE WILL HAVE TO FILE THAT WITH COURT HERE VERY SHORTLY. I'M STILL VERY COMMITTED TO MAKING THAT A PROCESS THAT IS THE. PROCESS OF INTEGRITY. ACOSTA STUDENTS TRY.

ABUSING INCARCERATED FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES- AND BE WE ARE FIGURING OUT A MORE HUMANE WAY TO RESPOND TO THE NEXT CRISIS THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN CDC ARE. SO THAT WE ARE ALSO NOT HAVING STAFF FILING GRIEVANCES AND SAYING THAT THEY'RE WORKING IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS ALONG WITH HAVING INCARCERATED FOLKS. CRYING TO EACH OTHER AND TO THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SAYING THAT THEY'RE GONNA DIE IN THERE. THANK YOU MA'AM- I. SO HOW CAN I TAKE THIS UNDERTAKEN SINCE PARTS IT OUT JOHN OUT OKAY ALL RIGHT SO. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. OUR CCAR'S FOR TO COPE WITH.

AS WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD TO GET PP AND ACTUALLY WE STRUGGLE TO GET HAND SANITIZER AND JUST SOME OF THE BASIC CLEANING SUPPLIES THAT SOME OF THE POPULATION YOU REFER TO. EVERYBODY STRUGGLE THERE WAS HUGE DEMAND WE FORTUNATELY OUR PRISON INDUSTRIES KIND OF STEPPED UP THEY STARTED MAKING SOME OF THE SUPPLIES FOR US SO WE HAVE AMPLE SUPPLY WE'RE ACTUALLY HEADED THAT GAME A LITTLE BIT- THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF CALLAWAY YES WE'RE ABLE TO GET THE APPROPRIATE PP. YOU KNOW IT WASN'T FIRST IT WASN'T IN MARCH AND I COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.

TO- YOUR COMMENT IT AS THE- O. I. G.'S REPORT ON- IT APPROPRIATE TREE OF A- WHETHER THEY AMERICANS WITH JUST ACT- OR ANY OF. I DON'T TOLERATE. THE ENTIRE POP BETWEEN DIGNITY RESPECT. AND SO I CERTAINLY SOME THE EFFORTS THAT WERE DUE AT LARGE R. G. JOHN- AND NOT ONLY BODY CAMERA BUT THE CARE. OUT OF FIXED CAMERA EMPLOY MAPLE OF THIS. WE HAVE A SUPER STAFF TO A- AS WELL TO REALLY HOW US. TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM ONCE I WILL SAY WE HAD A SIMILAR ALLEGATION AND ISSUES HIGH THAT'S A SUPER SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE IMPLEMENTED CALLOUS ABOUT THIS. AND THE THAT NUMBER- COMPLAINTS DROP DR. AND SO. I LOW FORWARD TO FOR TECHNOLOGY OUR FACILITIES TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS FOR A POPULATION OF OUR STAFF. THANK YOU FOR THAT WELL I TO AGREE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT REGARDLESS OF IF THEY'RE INCARCERATED OR NOT AND AS I SHARED WITH YOU AND OUR MEETING- IT MAKES ME THINK OF HOWARD FORD WHO I WANT TO RAISE UP WHO. IS SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD WHO IS AT C. S. P. LANCASTER- WHO'S BEEN INCARCERATED FOR OVER FORTY YEARS WHO COULDN'T GOT CODED. IN PRESENT AND IN DECEMBER. AS A RESULT HE GOT GANGRENE AND HAD BOTH OF HIS LEGS AMPUTATED AND HAD AN ACCELERATED HEART CONDITION. CDCR DID THAT TO HIM. AND WHILE THAT MAY BE AN EXTREME CASE IT'S STILL A CASE NCDC ARE AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STORIES. DON'T HAPPEN. BECAUSE HE WAS NOT TREATED. WITH RESPECT. I WANT TO. ASK ABOUT. ARE YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND HOW PROGRAMMING IS VERY CLOSE TO YOUR HEART IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE AUDITOR- REPORTED OUT THAT CDCR IS NEITHER. SHE CONSISTENTLY PLACE PEOPLE ON WAITING LISTS FOR NEEDED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS NOR HAVE THEY PRIORITIZE THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST NEED CORRECTLY IT TALKS A LOT ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THE IN PRISON COGNITIVE. BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS. AND CALLED INTO QUESTION- IN SAYS THAT CDCR FAILED TO MEET THE REHABILITATIVE NEEDS OF OVER HALF OF THE PEOPLE RELEASED. AND SO JUST WANNA. HEAR FROM YOU WHAT IS CDC ARE GOING TO DO TO PLAY A MORE MEANINGFUL. ARE AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN MAKING SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE. ACCESSIBLE AND ACCOUNT AND- AFFECTIVE. THANK YOU MA'AM WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED THOSE PROGRAMS AT ONE TIME WE HAD A HARD PROCESS WHERE WE HAD TO. MOVE THE POPULATION FROM ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER TO RECEIVE PROGRAMMING- AND THAT PROVED TO BE ONE DIFFICULT BUT YOU KNOW. IT IT JUST WASN'T APPROACH EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROGRAMMING AND SO THANKS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FUNDING NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS WE HAVE HERE IS PROGRAMS AT ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS TO INCLUDE A COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY- OUR INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WHICH IS ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT- FOR THE SUCCESS OF. A LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR POPULATION SUFFER FROM SOME SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR ANOTHER WE OFFER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION- AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT COME IN AND PROVIDE VARIOUS PROGRAM WITHIN OUR FACILITIES SO WE HAVE THOSE FORTUNATELY ALL OF OUR FACILITIES CURRENTLY TODAY WE HAVE FACE TO FACE COLLEGES EVERY SINGLE FACILITY IN THE STATE. THAT IS A TWO YEAR COLLEGE THANKS TO LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED AND- FORD'S THE POPULATION OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND- AND IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE A BALLOT FORTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A FOUR YEAR- FACE TO FACE COLLEGE PROGRAM LANCASTER STATE PRISON BEING ONE OF THEM. R. J. D. B. IN ANOTHER- STORE WHAT YOU KNOW AND WE'RE ALSO HOLD AND WE VERY. AS PAL ARE REUNIONS TO THE FEDERAL GRANT WHICH IS READ- ACTIVATED THIS TWENTY TWENTY. THE FEDERAL GRANTS BE SPREAD- YOU LOOKING FOR TO FURTHER EXPAND OF THE FOR YOU CALL SHOPPER. THE YOU THINK SO- SHE BE CAN CONTRA. I IN FAMILY COMMUNITY I WILL IN LEAD COMMUNICATION. SO BECAUSE OF OUR COMMITMENT TO LEGAL COMMUNICATION WE HAVE- WE JUST RECENTLY- COMPLETED A CONTRACT- FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR FAMILY COMMUNICATION EFFORTS WHICH AND THAT INCLUDES- PHONE CALL. WHAT THE LOWER PHONE RATES IN THE NAY. COUPLE AN BE SPENT WHEN I SAY THE RATE IN THE NAY. OUR RATES WENT FROM SEVEN POINT SIX CENTS A MINUTE TO TWO POINT FIVE CENTS PER MINUTE SO AN AVERAGE FIFTEEN MINUTE CALL IS A THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE CENTS- WITH THAT CONTRACT WE WERE ABLE TO SOLICIT ARE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN. TWO FREE PHONE CALLS AMONG FOR THE POPULATION THAT STARTED IN THE PANDEMIC I WILL GO THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THIS CONTRACT- IN ADDITION TO THAT WE WILL HAVE VIDEO COMMUNICATION AS IT RELATES TO EMAIL. VIDEO GRABS- EVERY SINGLE. PERSON IN THE POPULATION WILL RECEIVE A CHALLENGE THROUGH THIS AND THEN THE SERVICES- ON THOSE TABLETS THE YOU DON'T NEED TO BE PAID FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE A VIDEO CALL WE DO GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR VIDEO CALL- WHICH WE HOPE TO HAVE YOU KNOW. IN THE END IT'S GOING TO BE A PHASED APPROACH JUST BECAUSE OF THAT- LINES THE- COMPUTER LINES THAT HAVE TO BE DROPPED- FOR THE TABLET. WHEN YOU MEAN WHEN YOU SAY PHASED MEAN FACE BASED. PERSON DEEMING PHASE BASED LOW. OR DO. THANK YOU I'M SORRY I'M I'M A TEACHER PERSON GOT TO BE WITH ME YEAH THIS IS LOOKING QUESTIONS- ANYWAY- WE HAVE TO DROP LINES FOR ACCESS TO ANY. OF A TECH. SO WE TO DRUM A DRAW. LINES FOR THE COMPUTER SO THERE'S A- AT THE TOP THAT BUT SHE- OF FOR THEIR DUTY CALL. AND SO- AND THEY WILL HAVE. I'M SORRY GETTING CAN CHIU BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TABLETS FOR THE POPULATION TO RETAIN COLLAGEN WIFI EFFORTS THERE SO I DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE IT TO EFFORTS- ANYWAY WE HAVE WE DO HAVE A PHASED APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO. INITIAL IN THE PHONE CALLS WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THE PHONES ARE FACT. IS BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW. WE HAVE THE- THE TABLETS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED NOW THROUGH DECEMBER IT JUST DEPENDS UPON THE PHYSICAL PLANT STRUCTURE. OF THE FACILITY AND I'LL USE AN EXAMPLE- INSTITUTIONAL IS NEW LOW SAY LAW. ONE YEARS ONE THAT'S HIGH FIFTY YEARS ALL SHE DECENT. HOW YOU THE LAW TO THE CAN. FOR THE TECHNOLOGY I'M HOPING SAY THAT CORRECTLY- BUT THAT. THAT IS HOW I DO BELIEVE THAT LEAVES. IS THE BEST METHOD GOING FORWARD. WELL AS WE KNOW- PHONE ARE STILL BEING IN THE PER. AND SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE SMUGGLING THEM IN ALSO HAPPEN TO BE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE WE KNOW THIS IS TRUE. YES AND WE KNOW THAT PROHIBITION. DOESN'T FIX PROBLEMS WE THAT WE HAVE HISTORY- DID TO GIVE US THAT- AND SO I BELIEVE THAT IF YOU. CAN GIVE SOMEONE TABLETS YOU CAN GIVE SOMEONE PHONES BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL THEY- PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR FAMILIES PEOPLE ARE NOT WE DON'T HAVE FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO WHERE THEY ARE BEING HOUSED- AND IT WILL DRASTICALLY ALLEVIATE- THE ISSUES AROUND CONTRABAND CONFISCATION IN EVERY SINGLE I MEAN YOU POP OUT OF A WALL NOWADAYS AND SOMEONE IS GIVING YOU A FINAL. SO I- THINK WE JUST HAVE TO LIVE IN REALITY WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. TECHNOLOGY AND DEVICES AND HOW PEOPLE COMMUNICATE AND RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE THERE'S CURRENCY AN ECONOMY THAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR PRISONS. AND USING THAT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO- RESTRICT OR TO VIOLATE OR TO- CONTINUE TO PUNISH IS NOT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THROUGH THIS WE JUST HAVE TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN PRISON ARE STILL NEEDING TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING- INCARCERATED FOLKS WORKING- AND THE WAGES THAT THEY EARN. AND WANT TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT- THERE ARE NONE OF THERE'S A NATIONWIDE DISCUSSION AROUND. SLAVE LABOR HAPPENING IN THE PRISONS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME VENDORS WHO CONTRACT WITH THE PRISONS AND YOU KNOW HIRE FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO DO THE WORK IN PRESENT. THOSE SAME COMPANIES. WILL NOT HIRE THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT. WHICH I THINK IS. IRONIC TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT THEY CERTAINLY WANT TO GET THE LABOR OF THE PERSON WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED BECAUSE THE WAGES ARE SO LOW SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW YOUR THOUGHTS ON- THIS POPULATION THAT'S WORKING FOR THESE- YOU KNOW DE MINIMUS WAGES- AND WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT BECAUSE THIS IS A GOOD DISCUSSION THAT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE COUNTRY- AND ASKING US TO RECONCILE. THIS VERY GROSS INEQUITY. THANK YOU MA'AM I WILL SAY OUR JOINT VENTURE PROGRAMS I THINK IS WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AS RELATES TO. WHAT IF WITHIN THE FACILITY- THOSE OFFER MINIMUM WAGE ARE THOSE PROGRAMS NOW I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT WE HAD DIFFICULTY WITH THEM. SECURING EMPLOYMENT IN THE COMMUNITY- ACTUALLY. I LIKE TO USE THE LAST MILE FOR EXAMPLE HE AYE I KNOW THAT THAT PROGRAM OFFERS. SEVERAL OFFENDERS OPPORTUNITIES- AND I KNOW WE HAVE VARIOUS JOINT VENTURE PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE- OF THE BILLS DO OFFER A MINIMUM WAGE WHERE THEY HAVE THEY HAVE TO PAY RESTITUTION AND CERTAIN THINGS COME OUT OF THAT I DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS BUT HAPPY TO PROVIDE ALL THAT COMES OUT OF BATCH- BUT THAT'S SPECIFIC TO JOINT VENTURE PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION WE DO HAVE- AS YOU NO FIRE FIREFIGHTERS AS WELL AS WORKERS THAT THAT HAVE JOBS WITHIN THE FACILITY H. AND I AM CERTAINLY- SUPPORTED WITH ANY LEGISLATIVE CHANGES. TO THAT THROUGH THAT PROCESS. WHAT EIGHT- SIMILAR TO MR BY I'M GONNA ASK THAT I GET A CA FROM TO LOOK THE OF WITH YOU'RE CON. WITH BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE- CON. WITH A COME. THAT WILL HIRE FOLKS WHO ARE INCARCERATED FOR THOSE WAGES AND THEY STILL HAVE A POLICIES THAT EXPRESSLY FORBID THEM FROM HIRING THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT. SHAME ON EVERYONE SHANGHAI SHAME SHAME. YES. I'M SO. HAVE BEEN FOUND- THROUGH A NUMBER OF STUDIES TO BE A VERY- ALGORITHMIC TOOL ARM WITH THAT SORT OF. SOME VERY- GROSS OUTCOMES AS IT RELATES TO- DISPARITIES THROUGH ITS THE ASSESSMENTS RACIAL DISPARITIES- AND YET CDCR BEEN USING IT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME I THINK I HEARD SOMEONE SAY THAT YOU ALL ARE NO. YOU DISCONTINUE THAT CONTRACT OR THE CONTRACT- HAS ENDED I THINK I COULD BE WRONG BUT- I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT COMPASS. THANK YOU MA'AM WHEN YOU SHARE THAT WITH ME EARLIER TODAY I HAD STAFF FEVERISHLY TRYING TO. LOOK INTO THAT ISSUE I HAD NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE SHE AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THAT IS APPALLING I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY. RESEARCHING OTHER OPTIONS AND I KNOW THAT WE WERE GOING TO A BIG PROCESS. FOR OTHER OTHER POTENTIAL OPTIONS I DO NOT. HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE ABSENCE SINCE OUR EARLIER CALL TO DAMAGE BUT AGAIN THAT'S SOMETHING I CAN MEET YOU BOTH PROVIDING YOU AN UPDATED STATUS OR WE ARE. FOR- UPDATING CONTRACT THERE WAS IN JUNE IS A RED NEEDS. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH IT IS IT IS STAFF. SO INSTEAD I JUST. RISK POINTS. EACH AND- IT IS NOT DYNAMIC BACK YOU WILL. OTHER FACT. OF SOME- POLICY CONDO ANOTHER OTHER THINGS IT DOESN'T THOSE IN ACCOUNT THAT I AWARE OF. IT DOES TAKE A ACCOUNT AGE BUT- THE BIGGEST. WHEN SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE ON THE DRAW. ON THE REAL- ASSESSMENT PIECE OF IT SO I I'M VERY. INTERESTED IN ACT WHAT AT AND JUST. KEEP THAT WE- THAT I APPRECIATE THAT GREAT- MY AND I'M VERY ME I HAVE A FEW MORE. YOU- MENTIONED. ARM WELL SO I HAPPEN TO GO ON THE TOUR TO NORWAY WITH A NO OF- STAFF AND FOLKS FROM LEADERSHIP IN CDC ARE- AND DURING THE CALL OF THAT TRIP WE ARE TALK ABOUT- THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WILL BE OF THOSE THAT WERE IN THE PER. AND IMPORTANT- AND LEARNED ABOUT THE HIGH RATES OF SUICIDE- THE ONES FOLKS RETIRED THEIR LIFE IS PERFECT AND SEE IS JUST THREE OR FOUR YEARS- BEYOND THEIR RETIREMENT- WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN THE HOMES AND ALCOHOLISM HIGH RATES OF ALCOHOLISM IF TONIGHT WAS A FOR A FOUR PACK OR A SIX PACK NIGHT- VERY CONCERNING- AND WHILE EA PEAS ARE GREAT- YOU KNOW I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. SUPPORTS BETTER REQUIRED OF OUR STAFF IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO BEING A THERAPIST A FAIR PASSED HAS A THERAPIST. TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING- COUPLED WITH THAT THE VERY LOW THRESHOLD- FOR HIRING WE TALKED ABOUT THAT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND BEING TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE- IN BEING ABLE TO WORK IN ONE OF THESE FACILITIES HIGH STRESS. HIGH DEMAND. I'M AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR PLAN FOR HOW WE ARE. BECAUSE SAYING THAT THEIR HARD JOBS TO FILL AFTER A WHILE ISN'T ENOUGH IF WE STILL NEED PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS WE NEED PEOPLE IN THOSE POSITIONS SO WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR COMMITMENT IS TO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING  SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THOSE THAT ARE WORKING THERE. BUT AND ALSO ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'RE PROVIDING THE KIND OF TRAINING AND SUPPORT AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK. THANK YOU MA'AM AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU I WILL TELL YOU WHEN I WAS. THE DIRECTOR OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS ARE THEN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS PERSON CAME INTO MY OFFICE AND SHE WAS VERY PROUD. OF HER NEW PRODUCT- WHAT HER RECOMMENDATIONS WERE FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH. AND SHE WAS FOCUSING ON. THE CANTEEN WHAT WAS AVAILABLE IN THE SNACK BAR AND THE VENDING MACHINES. AND SHE WANTED SHE WAS ALL PRIVATE SHE'S GONNA MAKE SURE THAT BATES SALLINS. HAMBURGERS AND I KINDA LOST BY MY. AND I SAID. HOLD ON A MINUTE I'M NOT SIT HERE REGULAR WAS SOMEBODY EATS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS BALCO IS TO MASTER ALL ABOUT BY AND I SEE EVERY SINGLE WEEK. WHENEVER WE GET NOTIFIED OF STAFF TO GET A REST FOR. YOU ALL RIGHT OR THEY GET ARRESTED FOR DRUG FONG WE NEED TO FOLLOW ON IN ON. I WILL SAY WE'VE COME A LONG WAY WITH HER FOR A WHILE AFTER. WE NOW HAVE AN ALBUM JHELUM FOR ALL STAFF THEY CAN PRIVATE DOWN THE- TO GET FIRST RATE. OR SUPPORT- SUPERSTAR SUPPORT FOR SOME OF AND THEY CAN BE IN A PRO. WITH OTHER FIRST RESPONSE- IT HAS A VARIETY OF THAT AS LIKE. AND WE ALSO HAVE ON STAFF WHO LEADS UP OR ONE IS THE SHE ANSWERS. AS WE SHOULD WANT JOB- WE THERE'S A C. CAMPAIGN CITY THAT ARE NOT RICHARD WE DEPLOY AT OF. ARE TO GO OUT TO THOSE INSTEAD WITH. ON SUPPORTS. OFTEN TELL THEIR MEDICAL. ON HEALTH. APPEAR OFFICE. WHO WHO ARE. THE TRIM FONG OF BEING A- THEY'VE BEEN ASSAULTED DIPPED TALKED THROUGH THAT- AND REALLY BE THERE A SUPPORT PERSON FOR IF THEY NEED SOMEONE TO CALL. WHEN THEY'RE HAVING ROUGH NIGHT OF HOW A ROUGH SOMEONE TO TALK TO YOU I THINK WE NED YOU MORE ABSOLUTELY I DO. AT BECAUSE YOU YOUR WE STUFF. YOU KNOW. STAFFS THAT THE HI AFTER AFTER WE TALK- SURE SOME YOU KNOW DIE I LITERALLY OPENED UP MY EMAIL DAY I SAT. IT WAS JUST A NOW SYSTEM WHO JUST RETIRED. WHO PASSED A IN AN MARCH I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD. IT JUST BLEW. YOU KNOW WE WERE. TO ONE. I MEAN I DO I MEAN AND THAT PERSON WAS NOT USED BUT IT'S NOT HER MOTHER ANY BY LOS AT WORK THERE IS LIFE. ASSAULTS ARE REAL WE KNOW THAT PRISON RAPE IS HAPPENING- AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT- AND I DON'T WANT TO CONFLATE THE TWO BUT I AM- AS CONCERNED ABOUT- WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH FOLKS THAT WORK IN THE PRISONS AS I AM ABOUT FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THE PRESENT. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT OUR TRANS COMMUNITY THE TRANSOM PLEASE THAT ARE WORKING IN OUR PRISONS AND THE TRANSIT INCARCERATED FOLKS AND WHAT BECAUSE I KNOW WE PASSED THE LAW AND I KNOW WHAT CDCR SAYS IN THE MISSION- AND THEN I KNOW HOW PEOPLE ARE TREATED. SHE AND I WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT THE COMMITMENT IS TO PROTECT. BECAUSE WE CAN WE CANNOT ALLOW FOR THESE THINGS TO HAPPEN FOR DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES AGAINST OUR TRANS COMMUNITY BUT ALSO AND FOR RAPES TO CONTINUE TO BE HAPPENING IN OUR PRISONS ACROSS THE STATE AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S THAT THE FEDERAL SCREENING I KNOW ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S THE PRE OP. AND I KNOW THAT THESE THINGS ARE STILL HAPPENING- AND SO. I THINK I NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU WHAT THE COMMITMENT IS FROM CDC ARE ON BOTH OF THESE FRONTS. I'M TALKING ABOUT THEM TOGETHER THEIR SEPARATE. AND I AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE NOW AND UNFORTUNATELY- I THINK THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE TRANS GENDER POPULATION- HAS BEEN HIGHER RISK FOR OPREA ISSUE. ARE. AND I WILL SAY THAT WE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES BUT MANY OTHER STATES DID. WE DID TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WE IMPLEMENTED THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES. WE ARE OBSERVED BY OTHERS SO WE GET AUDITED ON EVERY THREE YEARS SO IT'S A PROCESS WHERE EVERY THREE YEARS AND- WE GET AUDITED ME DO SO MANY INSTITUTIONS IN HERE IN ORDER TO TAKE TO GET THEM ALL DONE- AND THOSE ARE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FROM AROUND THE NATION. I WILL SAY THAT- AS WE JUST RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED- SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY TWO. OUR GENEROUS BACKED AGENCY IN DIGNITY ACT THAT WAS SIGNED BY OUR GOVERNOR NEWSOM ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN TRANSGENDER WOMEN A REQUEST FOR TRANSFER WE RECEIVED TWENTY SEVEN NON BINARY- INMATE- REVIEW REQUEST. WE HAVE TRANSFERRED A TOTAL OF SEVEN TRANSGENDER FEMALES FROM MALE INSTITUTION TO A FEMALE INSTITUTION AND THERE ARE SEVERAL SCHEDULED FOR TRANSFER I THINK NEXT WEEK A BARBER CONFLICT IN THE NINETEEN- AND SO IT'S A PROCESS WHEN THEY HAVE TO APPLY. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH- COMMITTEE AT THE LOCAL INSTITUTION LOCAL INSTITUTION MAKES A RECOMMENDATION WE ARE PRIORITIZING AB ARE TRANS GENDER HOLDEN SITUATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. HOUSE FOR MANY YEARS- WE'RE PRIORITIZING NOT POPULATION FOR THOSE WHO TO GET THE FIRST COMMITTEES- THEY LIVED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AS TRANSGENDER SOME FOR YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AND SO TRYING TO FOR THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY FIRST- AND THEN WE AS FAR AS TRAINING BECAUSE I DO THINK TRAINING IS A KEY COMPONENT. SO THAT EVERYBODY'S TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEN IT TAKES TIME YOUR TRANSGENDER HUBS TO SOMEBODY WHO HAD A TRANSGENDER UP WHEN I WAS WORKING. I KNEW THAT I HAD TO BE OUT ON OF IT TO TRAIN STAFF TO BE RESPECTFUL AND TO A FOR THE POPULATION THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS AS ANYBODY. ELSE- SO WE HAVE. WITH THE TRANSGENDER CULTURAL INFLUENCE- TRANSGENDERS ARE CENTER OF NEW MEXICO- TO SUPPORT OUR EFFORTS WE ALSO HAVE IN STATE EXPERTS THAT- WE CONSULT WITH- WE ARE WORKING ON A TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR INSTITUTIONS STAFF. THROUGH A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF- ADRIAN LAWYER WHO HIMSELF IS A TRANS GENDER MALE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE POPULATIONS AND THE NEEDS- FOR THE POPULATION. WE ALSO HAVE- CLASSES FOR THE POPULATION THEMSELVES IT'S CALLED THE RIGHT PERSON RIGHT MISSION- THIS IS MANAGED BY A FEMALE OFFENDERS AND SPECIALIZED HOUSING ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR TO ASSIST WITH THE TRANSITION FROM LIVING IN A MALE INSTITUTION AND TO LIVING IN A FEMALE INSTITUTION AND VICE VERSA. IT IS A TWO HOUR CLASS DURING A FOUR WEEK SESSION SO WE'RE STILL IN THE INFANCY STAGES OF THAT BUT DEFINITELY ALL HAS TO BE PART OF THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION AND SAFETY FOR ALL BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO PROTECT. EVERYBODY ARM SO IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS AS WE AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROCESS AND DEFINITELY- COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT IT IS SUCCESSFUL. WELL CAN I COUNT ON YOUR- COMMITMENT TO. FOLLOW UP WITH ME ON ON THIS ISSUE AND ALSO ON THE ISSUES AROUND- PRISON RAPE AND HAVE WHAT IS BEING DONE TO- ELIMINATE OR- DECREASE THOSE NUMBERS- AND THEN ALSO ON HOWARD FORD- WHO NOW HAS NO LEGS AT LANCASTER. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR SHARING HIS INSTITUTION ON BUT I HAVE STAFF SEARCH WE DID HAVE SEVERAL HOWARD FORTS. HOW ANYWAY SO YEAH I APPRECIATE KIDS I'M SURE I CAN FIND HIM NOW THEY KNOW EXACTLY AS YOU'D SEASON YES ALLEN CASTOR SEVENTY SEVEN BEEN THERE FOR FORTY YEARS PLUS. AMPLUG DOUBLE AMPUTEE. WHEN I HEARD. ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT YEAH AS- I'M SURE YOU KNOW MEDICALLY I CAN'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS BUT- YEAH I WILL DEFINITELY TO. WITH OUR UNDER SECRETARY OF HEALTHCARE EACH AND SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO EVALUATE THIS CASE AND WE WILL DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME I KNOW WHY IT ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND I AM- GRATEFUL THAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE INDULGED ME IN THIS TIME WITH YOU- I AM TELL I'M ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE I I'M LETTING YOU KNOW THAT I'M I'M GOING TO BE IN YOUR BUSINESS ABOUT THESE ISSUES. I'M GONNA BE IN YOUR BUSINESS- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. AND SO I'M I'M SAYING IT ON THE RECORD- AND I HOPE THAT WHEN PEOPLE CALL IN IN SUPPORT FOR YOU IT IS MORE THAN JUST THE TWO FORMAL LETTERS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM PROBATION AND FROM SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT I HOPE THERE ARE OTHER FOLKS THAT CALL IN THAT SAY- WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE IN THE BUSINESS. OF MISS ALLISON BECAUSE WE WANT HER TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR LET ME TURN TO THE VICE CHAIR WOMAN- AND ASK SENATOR BATES WHO SHE WOULD LIKE TO GO NEXT. THANK YOU ARM THEM CHAIR IAN THANK YOU MISS SELFRIDGE SECRETARY ALLISON FOR YOUR VERY IN DEPTH RESPONSE TO MANY MANY QUESTIONS SANDRA WE DID HAVE THOUGH I THINK I WAS VERY VERY COMPREHENSIVE FIVE DISCUSSION ONE ON ONE AND NOT THE OTHER DAY I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR RESUME. I AND I MENTIONED I DIDN'T MEAN TO DEMEAN YOUR ROLE. IN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT I SAID TO A SECRETARIAL THING YOU STARTED IN THE MAIL ROOM I GOT ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP AND THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. BUT I DON'T I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO ME AND I'LL FOLLOW NOT AT ALL THE SO I THINK WE HAD A CHUCKLE OVER THAT SO THAT WAS GREAT BETTER. I HAVE TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT- I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE SO VERY VERY QUALIFIED FOR THIS POSITION YOU'VE MADE A NUMBER OF COMMITMENTS TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE. ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES- BUT I DO THINK THAT THE MANNER IN WHICH- THE VERY LATE NOTICE OF THE CLOSURE. OF THE SUSANVILLE PRISON AND MORE ARE AS IMPORTANT COOLEY- THE FIRE- CAMPED THERE HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. OF HERE AND I'M NOT A POSITIVE WAY REGARDING THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE THINGS TAKE PLACE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR LEGISLATORS TO REPRESENT THOSE AREAS AND WHAT WE CONTEND WITH. ALL WHEN WE GET CALLS ABOUT WHY DID THEY DO IT WHAT'S THE DATA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME ON AND ON AND ON. SO I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BECAUSE TODAY I AM GOING TO ABSTAIN. BUT WITH THE FULL INTENTION BECAUSE I THINK ALL OF THE CANDIDATES UP TODAY HAVE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESUMES THAT NEED TO BE SUPPORTED. BUT I WANT TO HAVE IN WRITING THE PLAN AND WHAT YOU SHARED IN TERMS YOUR COMMITMENT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A TWO PAGER WITH BULLET FIVE BELIEVE. THAT WE WILL HAVE GOING FORWARD MANNER IN WHICH IS AN ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED LANDERS CLOSURES AND LET LET ME JUMP TO THE CLOSURE SIDE. WITH A MEMBER OF THE CDC WE ARE THERE IS A COME. THAT I WAS A POOR TO BY THE GOVERNOR. FOR TWO THOUSAND. WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD SUPERVISORS. AND THAT'S WHEN THE ISSUE OF PRISON OVER. WAS VERY VERY MUCH IN THE NEWS AND WE HAVE THE FEDERAL. MANDATE TO REDUCE- ISN'T POPULATION AT THAT TIME THERE WAS BUDGET. OF ALLOCATION FOR A BUILDING PRISONS ANDWE'VE GONE THE OTHER WAY BECAUSE WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT. A CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND YOU KNOW THAT WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT I AM VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. IT WOULD BE NICE OF THESE FACILITIES THAT ARE BEING CLOSE TO WOULD IN FACT- B. REHABILITATION CENTERS WHERE PEOPLE COULD GO FOR THOSE SPECIAL PROGRAMS BUT THAT'S% SOMETHING. THAT I MIGHT ASK THOUGH THE FACILITIES- OF. CANDIDATE THAT YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THERE WAS A HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND. IT'S NOW DOWN TO NINETY FIVE THOUSAND IN ONLY THE TO PRESENT YOU MENTIONED. THERE'S A 45% CAPACITY- SO THAT LEAVES A LOT OF ROOM OUT FAILED TO ONE OF THE FACILITIES THE 65% CAPACITY AT THE OTHER ONE WHICH MEANS THEY'RE STILL PROVIDING SERVICES. AND THOSE ON THE CLOSURE LIST SO WE HAVE NO IDEA. WHAT'S THE STANDARDS ARE FOR DETERMINING THAT. WE'VE HEARD FROM YOU SOME OF THOSE BUT I THINK WE NEED THAT IN WRITING BECAUSE THEN. WHEN WE ARE STANDING UP FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION OR STANDING UP TO SAY THAT. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING JOB THAT YOU'VE- YOU. YOU'LL COME BACK AND TAKE DO YOU WANT TO RECONSIDER THAT RIGHT AWAY. I JUST THINK THAT IF YOU DON'T EVEN. I CAN SEE YOU STANDING UP AND RUNNING OUT OF THE ROOM YET SO ANYWAY I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THAT AND I'M SPEAKING OF A LACK OF OFFICIAL ONE I CAN SHARE WITH MY CONSTITUENTS THE SPECIFICS OF WHY HIGHER VOTED. WHY A PERSON ARE I AM TOTALLY COMMITTED TO THAT PERSON OR THAT ISSUE OR AND I SHOW THEM THE DATA THEY MIGHT NOT ALL AGREE AGREE WITH ME BUT THEY HAVE TO TAKE MY FINAL DECISION AND I DON'T DO THAT WITHOUT PROVIDING SOME EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND THAT'S WHAT'S MISSING HERE. CANNOT THAT YOU'RE WORTHY OF THE GOLD HOLDEN THAT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO COMMUNICATE THAT SO I WAS JUST SAYING BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE ARE READY TO DISCUSS THIS- IN THE CHAMBERS I OUR SESSION. EACH ONE OF US WILL BE ABLE TO STAND TALL WITH THE QUESTIONS COME OUT FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND WE WILL HAVE SOME OF THE DATA THAT WAS USED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND IN PARTICULAR THAT MEANS SHARE THAT WHEN WE'RE AT 45% 265% THE QUESTION IS WHY THAT BLOCKED. THE LESS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE AN EMPTY PRISON LIKE. MY COLLEAGUES. I FROM CURRENT MANAGER. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE WHOLE DIFFERENT THING AND IF THERE'S AN EMPTY FOR. THERE THAT OPENS DISCUSS ABOUT THE OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE WITH HOME OF THE OTHER NEEDS WE HAVE FOR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. ON AND ON AND ON AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT. ARE BECOMING EXTREMELY EXTREMELY IMPORTANT POLICY WISE. FOR OUR LEGISLATION IN OUR LEGISLATURE. SO YOU JUST HAVE MY FIVE FIVE- VERY VERY SUPPORTIVE BUT- I TO ME IT'S JUST A SIMPLE. REQUEST OF YOU. AND I'M SURE THAT KNOWING YOUR CAPABILITIES. THAT YOU CAN POP ME SOMETHING PRETTY QUICK ON ON THE- DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP IN IF THERE IS. SOMETHING SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF A- STANDARD THAT IS USED FOR ECONOMIC IMPACT. THAT SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS NEEDS TO BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE I THINK WILL BE VERY CONVINCING. THAT WE NEED TO GO THIS WAY AND NOT THAT WAY BUT WHEN YOU'RE LEAVING A TOWN- SHORT OF A THOUSAND JOBS. AND YOU WANT ME TO SAY THAT'S OKAY THAT'S REALLY DIFFICULT UNLESS I KNOW WHAT. IS HAPPENING TO THOSE THOUSAND JOBS WHAT'S GOING TO REPLACE THEM. AND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THE PEOPLE IN THAT TOWN. IN TERMS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES SO. THAT'S WHERE I AM BUT I DO. HAVE I THOUGHT YOU DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN ON MANY OF THE POINTS WE DISCUSSED. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. OUR COLLEAGUES HERE IF THEY DIDN'T DISCUSS IT ABOUT THE EDT FAILURES AND- HOW YOU HAVE NOW WORKED WITH EDIE D. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. A CONVERSATION THAT GOES BACK AND FORTH. BASICALLY IT'S GOING TO BE ON. THE DATA TO SO THAT THEY WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE EIGHTY DVDS- THAT. APPLICATIONS ARE FOR PEOPLE NOT ELIGIBLE WHO ARE STILL. INCARCERATED THE FUTURE THAT BRIEFLY AND THEN LIKE I SAID. YOU HAVE MY FIVE FIVE BUT TO I GOTTA WAIT A FEW DAYS. OF. FOR A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION TO COME MY WAY. THANK YOU MATH I WILL SAY THAT ARE FULL. CURBSIDE IS A EIGHTY PER. OF OUR CAPACITY- 81% OF OUR OVER A THREE JUDGE PANEL PASSED AT ONE THIRTY FIVE AND SO OUR OVERALL NUMBERS SO MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE WELL BELOW ARE- WHAT ARE BUILT CAPACITY SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S HIGHLIGHTED SO CASH THE POPULATION THAT IS NOT THE EXACT SUSAN BELL. AS WELL AS- GOES TO SECURE LEVEL ONE FACILITIES- IS EASY EASILY ABSORBED INTO OUR NUMEROUS VACANCIES AROUND THE STATE. I WILL SAY THAT- EDG FRAUD IS A PROBLEM. WE HAVE WORKED WE- ARE OFFICE OF CORRECTIONAL SAFETY IS PARTNERED WEST OF THE D. A.'S ON WE HAVE NUMEROUS STAFF ASSIGNED TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL AS INSTITUTIONAL STAFF ASSIGNED TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS. WE EARLY ON SIGNED A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WITH YOU DO YOU DO YOU TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE- SHARING OF INFORMATION TO PREVENT FROM ACROSS. THE EFFORT FINAL COMMENT IS ON THE A NUMBER OF FOLKS- WHO ARE AVAILABLE FOR FIGHTING FIRES AND THE TRAINING THAT GOES ON- HASN'T BEEN ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO REPLACE THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE- ON. YOU KNOW YEAH I CAN RIGHT IN FRONT OF ALL THE WILD LAND FIRE SEASON AND JUST COMMITTED. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO EFFORTS IN THAT AREA. ALL OF THE CURRENT FIRE CAMPS WILL REMAIN OPEN OKAY. THERE ARE SOME BIG MISUNDERSTANDING YEAH GOOD THEN I PUT THAT ON YOUR LITTLE NOTE BACK TO ME AND I'M GOOD. THANK YOU MA'AM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- CENTER LAYER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND- THERE IS SOME ADVANTAGE TO GOING TO THIS PLACE IN THE ORDER. OF IT I KNOW I DID IT TO ALL OF YOU WITH THE PARKS DIRECTOR LAST WEEK AND IT WAS A KARMIC REPAYMENT TODAY SO IT IS GREAT A. N. IT JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE R. A AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK IN THE NEXT OUR SESSION WITH THE NEXT THREE. OCCUR ABOUT FIRE CAMPS- BECAUSE I HAD THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT- TODAY WITH THEM AND IF THE ISSUE IS AS MUCH. NOT JUST AT ALL THIRTY FIVE FIRE CAMPS- ARE STAYING OPEN UNDER REALIGNMENT. WITH THE ARE WHATEVER YOU CALL IT OF THE LESSER OFFENDERS MOVING BACK TO THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY MOVED OUT OF THE ABILITY TO COME THROUGH THE STATE SYSTEM TO THE OF FIREFIGHTING AND SO THE ISSUE IS NOT SO MUCH THE FIRE CAMPS REMAINING OPEN THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT THERE ARE LESS PEOPLE TO GO INTO THE FIRE CAMPS FROM THE SYSTEM. AND THAT IS A QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE ASKED BY AUSTIN IT AND OTHER PIECES OF THE OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION I APPRECIATED OUR DISCUSSION. AND I. TO OUR SENATOR ARE WALKED THE SECRETARY THROUGH THE- THEIR PROGRAMS ON ON TRANS PEOPLE AND I ALSO NOTED THAT IT IS AN UNUSUAL CAREER PATH TO GET TO WHERE YOU ARE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN NOTED BY EVERYBODY ON THE WAY AND I THINK IT IT IS GREAT THAT THERE IS. APAPA DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE DEAD DEAD THE GROUP WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE TOP IN THE END. AND THAT'S OUR HELPFUL. SINCE EVERYTHING HAS BEEN ASKED LET LET ME DO TWO THINGS IN THE FIRST ONE IS TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING. ABOUT THE CLOSURE BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO COME AT IT. AND FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY IT'S REALLY BEEN DRIVEN HOME AND NOT IN THE CONVERSATION THUS FAR BUT AS THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN SAID WE SAID IN OUR- CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. GOING FROM A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND IN THE SYSTEM TO NINETY FIVE THOUSAND. IN EVAN EE THERE IS GOING TO BE. OUR LESS USE OF FACILITIES SO HOW. YOU IS HOW DO YOU MAKE THE DECISION OVER TIME. YOU JUST GO IT 80% CAPACITY OF EVERY FACILITY DECIDE YOU WANT 80% CAPACITY FULL IN MOST FACILITIES AND CLOSE OTHERS. WHAT IS THE DECISION MAKING FOR DEALING WITH THE REDUCTION UP AGAINST THE FACILITIES THAT EXIST IN THE SYSTEM. F. N. THIS IS JUST GRANTING. ARE THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT YOU'LL RESPOND ON THE CRITERIA FOR THE SPECIFIC CLOSURES BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THERE'S JUST LARGER POLICY QUESTION- SYSTEM IS BEEN DOWNSIZING AND POPULATION. HOW DO YOU RESPOND WITH THE FACILITIES. THANK YOU SIR AS YOU NOW- SOME OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS WERE- CONNECT HIM TO STABILIZE. OUR COURT COMMITMENTS TO WHAT WE CALL THE THREE JUDGE PANEL WE HAVE A COURT ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR OVERALL STATE POPULATION A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE PERCENT. SO SOME OF THOSE INITIATIVES AND CHANGES WAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. AND SO- THAT'S WHAT STARTED THE INITIAL PUSH AND REALIGNMENTS ARE REALIGNMENT WAS- COMPLETED YEAH ASSEMBLY BILL ONE ON NINE AND TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN. AND THAT SO IT TOOK THAT SAME LOW LEVEL OF GENDER NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT NON SEX OFFENDERS TO SERVE THEIR TIME AT THE COUNTY JAIL. OBVERSES TO STATE PRISON AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST CHANGE- THERE WERE OTHER CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS TO DAHLE ALONG THE WAY BUT I WOULD SAY WAS THE MARKET DIFFERENCE SH AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD. I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE TO PAUSE AND REEVALUATE POST CODE. WHAT WE HAVE DISCOVERED IS ARE OPEN DORM SETTINGS VERSUS CELLS WITH SOLID SOUTH CORRIDORS. IT IS DIFFERENT. MARKET IN DIFFERENT AND SO WE HAVE TO PAUSE IN REIMAGINE WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK LIKE- YOU KNOW I SAY OUR POPULATION IS AT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND BUT WE DO HAVE. LIKE TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE COUNTY JAILS THAT HAS ADVERSELY BEEN IMPACTING THE COUNTY JAILS AND SHERIFFS HAVE BEEN VERY VERY VOCAL ABOUT THAT UNDERSTANDABLY SO BECAUSE WE HAVE WE WERE CLOSE TO AND TAKE. FOR THE MAJORITY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. N. EXCUSE TO JUST QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THAT MEAN IF THERE HADN'T BEEN COVERT DO DEF TEN THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE. IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. YES SIR OKAY. AND MANY HAVE BEEN RELEASED FROM THAT- COUNTY JAILS AFTER AFTER THEIR CREDIT IS APPLIED- WE TOOK IT WE ASK FOR ALL THE SENTENCING DOCUMENTS FOR EVERYBODY TWO YEARS ALL LAST SO MANY TIMES A POPULATIONS ACTUALLY POLLING BIKES FROM THE COUNTY JAIL AND I WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL SHERIFFS ON THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS- AS IT RELATES TO BRING AN END BASED ON THEIR OWN OVERCROWDING ISSUES- BUT I WILL SAY WE HAVE TO REALLY CONSIDER WHAT ARE WE DOING AS FAR AS- THE POPULATION NOW ANYTHING. YOU KNOW. HOW IS IT WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE LAWS TAT ARE GIVEN OKAY- AND- FOR EXAMPLE YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE PRISON POPULATION IN THE LATE EIGHTIES EARLY NINETIES. THAT WAS BASED ON LAW CHANGES THAT THINGS CHANGED WE'RE NOW KIND OF REVERSING SOME OF THAT WITH REALIGNMENT SOME OF THE CREDIT EARNING CHANGES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGED. THE PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WITH THE THIRD STRIKE LAW FOR A NON SERIOUS NONVIOLENT. ALL OF THE LAWS ACTUALLY IMPACT THE POPULATION FOR HOW LONG THEY STAY THAT COUPLED WITH- YOU KNOW OUR BORDER PRISON- HEARINGS AS YOU KNOW. THE RATE- GRANTS. IT HAS IT HAS INCREASED I MEAN THAT'S THE REALITY OF THE LAST YOU KNOW THROUGH BUT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF DESCRIBING WHAT THE CHANGES WERE INTHE POPULATION. AND I THINK PART OF MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU RESPONDING TO THE CHANGES SO THAT IT IN TERMS OF OUR FACILITIES THE AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THAT SORT OF GOT NOTED BUT NOT DIRECTLY- WITH THE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE KEPT IN THE COUNTY JAILS IT MEANS THE ONES. THAT REMAIN IN THE STATE SYSTEM MORE FOR MUCH MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES. A. N. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CHANGES. ARE ARE SORT OF WHAT YOUR SPACE FOR YOUR YOUR FACILITIES NEEDS ARE BECAUSE OF THE NATURE WHO'S THERE. ARE MY QUESTION IS JUST HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ADJUST WHAT ARE YOUR POLICIES FOR JOSH TO EVEN IF. WE HAVE A SITUATION THAT JUST HAPPENED IN THE LAST DAY OR TWO WHERE. NOTIFICATION IS AN ISSUE WATER ALL THE DECISIONS UP TO THE NOTIFICATION THAT DECIDE WHERE AND WHEN BECAUSE- ALMOST EVERY SINGLE. ONE IS IN A RURAL AREA SO IS GOING TO. OUR MEN ARE MEMBER WHEN I WAS. SECRETARY GOVERNMENT. I THINK IN SIERRA COUNTY THE FORCE. OFFER AND JUST KILLED THE COUNTY SEATS. KANEMI ARE JUST KILLED IT IN EVERY WAY SO. THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I'M WONDERING WHAT THE BECAUSE I HAVE A FEELING IF YOU'RE TRANSPARENT WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT AS IT HEADS UP TO IT WE CAN SEE THE POPULATION CHANGES AND IF WE KNOW. IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO LEAVE EVERYONE OPEN AT 80% BECAUSE THAT'S NOT EFFICIENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MOVE. TO CLOSE SOME FACILITIES WE CAN START TO LOOK AT. WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE AND HOW TO DO IT AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROBE WITH YOU. IS A LONG TERM AT THE HIGH LEVEL HOW DO YOU DECIDE. WHAT IT IS THAT. AND I KNOW. IT'S ALSO ABOVE YOUR PAY GRADE PEOPLE HELP YOU MAKE THE DECISION. BUT IT'S LIKE THE FOR YOUR INPUT HOW DO YOU START TO DECIDE WHICH ONES. WHAT KINDS. OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO SHRINK BACK- I THINK THAT'S FAIR THAT YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID KOBE DOES IMPACT DORM SETTINGS VERSUS CELL SO WE HAVE TO START THERE IN MY OPINION. I HAVE TO WORK WITH THE RECEIVERS OFFICE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD- IN ADDITION WE FILE. FOLLOW THE PENAL CODE SECTIONS AS I HIGH ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED TO DAMAGE- ALL THOSE. ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE FACILITIES FORECLOSURE- AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR THE CONVERSATIONS AS IT RELATES TO ADDITIONAL CLOSURES OUTSIDE AND AGAIN GOVERNMENT THIS YEAR AND EIGHTY PERCENT. OF WHAT YOUR RECEIVER CATEGORIAS IT'S CLEAR. THAT UNLESS THERE'S SOME BIG BURST OF ACTIVITY YOU'RE HEADED IN A DIRECTION WHERE SOMETHING LIKE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT THE PRIORITIES ARE- THEN LET ME TRY TO OTHER THINGS R. ONE IS AND I DIDN'T TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS CLEARLY IN OUR MEETING. BUT YOU SEE I HAD THE MISFORTUNE BEEN BUDGET CHAIR WHEN IT WAS THE POPULATION WAS AT THE HEIGHT. THE A AND WHEN IT WAS A TWO THIRDS REQUIREMENT FOR THE BUDGET AND WE STRUGGLED ARE WITHIN THAT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO. AND WE ADOPTED THE FIRST PROGRAMS FOR REHABILITATION IN MORE MODERN TIMES. ARE HOW WITH REGARD TO SCHOOLING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES- AND WE STARTED WITH THE WOMEN'S PRESENCES AYE I RECALL WHEN WE DID THE FIRST REHABILITATION HOW. IT HAPPENED HOW HAVE YOU SEEN THE AFFECT CHANGE THERE AND WHAT YOU DO IN TERMS OF. SORT OF TRAINING AND DIFFERENT STYLES OF REHABILITATION WITHIN THE SYSTEM. WELL I CHANGE OVER THE YEARS FOR THE BETTER- YOU KNOW WE'VE ALWAYS HAD ACADEMIC AND VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR FACILITIES. RIGHT NOW WE HAVE OUR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION WHICH IS ALSO BROKE I USE AN OLD TERM SO BEAR WITH ME- THEY HAVE THE BALLS TO BE JOBS THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN PAY RATE A LIVABLE WAGE- UPON RELEASE THEY THEY HAVE TO PARTICIPATE FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET THEIR CERTIFICATES WE'VE ADDED ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY PROGRAMS. THAT DIDN'T- PROVIDE A LIVABLE WAGE AND SO MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS ALONG THE WAY I THINK ARE CRITICAL WE ALSO HAVE SOME SOME HIGH TECH- PROGRAMS OUT THERE- THAT TEACH COMPUTERIZED CODY MANAGE AND WE ALSO UNDER WATER WEALTHY YOU HAVE UNDERWATER WELDING YOU GRADUATE YOU YOU RELEASED TOMORROW YOU CAN REPORT- THE NEXT DAY TO THE DOCKS THE OF LONG BEACH AND HAVE A JOB THAT PAYS YOU KNOW HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR. SO I MEAN THOSE ARE OBVIOUSLY THE EXTREME PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BUT YOU KNOW THE ONE NUMBER ONE REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET A LIVABLE WAGE WE HAVE TO RESTORE THE POPULATION IS AFFORD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BASIC ADULT EDUCATION MANY OF OUR POPULATION ARE I'M THINKING WHICH IS A SECOND LANGUAGE INSERTED BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS SO NOT ONLY CAN THEY LEARN. ON THAT THEY CAN SUCCEED AS WELL- GO GOING FORWARD- SO I WILL SAY I'VE SEEN IT CHANGE A LOT YOU'RE RIGHT IT DID START- THE FEMALE PROGRAMS AND WE HAVE FURTHER EXPANDED WE'VE ALSO YOU KNOW WE FOLLOW UP. PROCESS THAT- THAT ARE. NEED TO BE BASED AT THAT THEY TO FOR IS CRITERIA IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAMS- TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES WITHIN OUR FACILITIES FOR SOME OF OUR CONTRACT BASED PROGRAMMING WHICH I WILL SAY SOME OF THOSE OF THE RICHEST PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE. YOU KNOW SO THOSE ARE THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY KIND OF LIFE SKILL KIND OF BEING CREATIVE WRITING THOSE KIND OF PROGRAMS. ALSO BENEFIT THE POPULATION- AS SEEN BY YOU KNOW THE- SIX AT THE- BOARD- FOR A POTENTIAL RELEASE OR EVEN EXCEPTIONAL CONTACT OUT. THE REFERRALS FROM THE SECRETARY'S OFFICE UNDER PENAL CODE ELEVEN SEVENTY D. THOSE- PEOPLE THAT HAVE REALLY MADE A CHANGE IN THEIR LIVES WERE ABLE TO PRESENT THOSE CASES TO A COURT FOR RECONSIDERATION OF SENTENCE. FACE SOME PASTA PROGRAM THANK YOU THAT THAT IS VERY HELPFUL AND I JUST A. N. AS WE MENTIONED THE FIRST TIME AROUND THE LEGISLATURE I DID NOT HAVE A- FACILITY IN MY DISTRICT I DO THIS TIME AND SAN LUIS OBISPO AND I'VE VISITED THERE FOR. THE PRICE THAT THEY MAKE SHOES AND IT WAS IMPRESSIVE AND EVERYBODY REALLY WANTS TO GO THERE ARE THAT THAT'S INSIDE TOWARD TO WORK THERE SAW IT WAS AN IMPRESSIVE HOME PROGRAM. LASTLY JUST SOMETHING I ASKED YOU. IN THE MEETING BUT- JUST TO LET YOU COMMENT ON IT IN PUBLIC. I HAD A RATHER STRANGE EXPERIENCE WITHOUT WHEN I WAS WORKING MY WAY TO BUDGET CHAIRED THE FIRST YEAR IT WAS THE TIME OF THE RECALL AND GOVERNOR SORTS AND I AGREE. AND WE- HEARINGS RIGHT AWAY. ON THE PRISON SYSTEM AND WE WERE SIX MONTHS INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THE SYSTEM NEVER ENTERED. WHAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAD APPROVED SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE OVER SPENDING BY SOMETHING LIKE A BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T EVEN ENTER IT IN THEIR BOOKS. WHAT HAD BEEN APPROVED FOR THE BUDGET THAT YEAR. ARM JUST ASSURE ME HOW DIFFERENT IT IS THESE DAYS WITHIN YOUR SYSTEM. OH BOY IT'S DIFFERENT I WILL SAY I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR BUDGET SHOP WE HAVE A SOLID BUDGET SHOP- AND WE HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT USED TO WORK FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE THEY KEEP US ON TRACK WHICH- IS YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT FINANCES VERY LONG. A RECEDING- OUR PROCESSES TO ENSURE CDCR STAYS WITHIN OUR BUDGET. I WAS CURIOUS HOW YOU'RE GOING TO DESCRIBE THE DEPARTMENT. OF FINANCE WHEN YOU STARTED THAT SENT. IN ANY EVENT THAT THANK YOU. IT'S MUTUALLY NOW I'VE GOT A- HER I'M FED THEY TRIED TO ME IN THE AND DO NOT WORK- BUT LET ME THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATED OUR ABILITY TO TALK AND YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS AND I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOU TO. THANK YOU SIR. SENATOR THANK YOU- FOR THE RECORD I THINK SENATOR COME LONGER NEEDS TO CORRECTED NAME- IF YOU WOULD ON THE RECORD US SENATOR AND THEN I NEED TO GO BACK TO SENATOR GROW FOR AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IT- MISS ALICE AND I SAID HOWARD FORD IT'S HERALD FORWARD- OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK I MIGHT MAKE IT EASIER. YEAH I CAN IMAGINE THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PROTEIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. I AT A SECRETARY I DO JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN- I JUST HEARD BACK FROM ANOTHER COLLEAGUE WHO WAS AGAIN NOT AWARE. OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS RELEASED BY CDC ARE A SENATOR KABIRU IN DISTRICT TWELVE. WITH SOLEDAD AND- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE QUESTIONS THAT SHE HAS ASKED ME TO ASK HER. A PRETTY SIMILAR OR EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT I'VE ASKED BEFORE ABOUT HOW YOU CAME ACROSS PROCESS WHO DETERMINES WHAT PRISONS ARE CLOSE WHAT PROCESS FOR THE COMMUNITY IS GIVEN. WHEN IS A DECISION A DECISION FINALIZED- WHAT'S THE CRITERIA I MEAN ALL OF THESE ARE ONES THAT YOU'VE WHO LOSE THEIR JOB AHEAD STAFF ISSUES AHEAD COMMUNITY ISSUES. THEY'RE ALL QUESTIONS THAT I HAD ASKED YOU PREVIOUSLY REGARDING THE TO HATCH A P. AND THE- THE SUSANVILLE PRISON- I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED EARLIER AND NOT AND EXCLUSIVE THEY'RE NOT IN EXCLUSIVE AND ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS THAT LEGISLATORS HAVE I DON'T WANT TO PLAN FOR- FOR DISPATCH BE A ONE MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR AND THAT THERE'S NO MISUNDERSTANDING THAT ALL OF US LEGISLATORS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THIS PROCESS IS. IS HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. AND THAT ALL OF THIS- ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE MAYBE NOT ALL OF THIS BUT SPECIFICALLY THE ONES THAT HAVE ASKED FOR THIS- REQUEST A BETTER PROCESS MOVING FORWARD AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CENTER. SENATOR KABIR UNDERSTANDS THAT- HER AT DISTRICT IS INCLUDED IN THAT REQUEST. THANK YOU MA'AM OF COURSE I WILL SAY THAT WE- ACCORDING TO THE- MY CURRENT KNOWLEDGE AS WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE- CTO OR CCI TO ANTICIPATE- LAYOFFS FOR- DISPLACEMENTS THERE'S ENOUGH VACANCIES AT THOSE LOCATIONS TO ABSORB THAT THE REJECTION OF THE STOCK ON THAT ONE INDIVIDUAL YARD. OKAY THANK YOU MA'AM VERY MUCH IN A FOLLOW UP QUESTION ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY- REGARDING THE UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- DECEIVE YOU SEE ARE CURRENTLY ACROSS REFERENCE SO SECURITY NUMBERS WITH THOSE IN. M. IN CUSTODY WITH THOSE APPLYING. FOR BENEFITS AT THE EDT OFFICE. WE PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION FOR EDG TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT CROSS REFERENCE THANK YOU MA'AM. THANK YOU SENATOR ALL. AND LET ME- SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME ALL RIGHT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ME MUCH EARLIER THAN THIS WEEK WE HAD WE DID THIS- A BIT AGO- I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT MY STAFF HAVE HAVE COLLECTED THEM- ARE ARE THERE SO THAT WE CAN GET AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE I HAVE A FEELING THAT THE- THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT CLOSURES. SORT OF TOOK PRECEDENCE OVER- SOME ISSUES ALTHOUGH I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR COM LONGER FOR THE QUESTIONS AS SHE ASK AND CERTAINLY RELATED- ALSO CENTER LAYERED REFERENCE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY AND HOUSING- ISSUES APPRECIATE ALL THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A BENEFIT TO GOING LAST- BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I WANTED TO- I JUST WANT TO PUT ON THE RECORD- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR EXPERIENCE MUCH TO THE POINT THAT SENATOR BATES THE VICE CHAIRWOMAN. MENTIONED YOUR HISTORY YOUR DIVERSE BACKGROUND AND WHAT YOU BRING TO THIS POSITION- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU I THINK WHEN WE MET I OUT LET YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIOR- SECRETARY HAD A AT A PRACTICE. AT OUR REQUESTED THE RULES COMMITTEE OF MEETING WITH US ON A PRETTY REGULAR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF. CONCERNS AND ISSUES- THAT WE HAD- AND MANY TIMES THAT INCLUDED SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM. THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE- I MIGHT WANNA IT JUST SUGGEST IN TERMS OF THE CAPACITY ISSUES. THAT THIS IS AN ITEM THAT CAN BE. A JOINT AYE INFORMATIONAL HEARING CLEARLY NOT RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC BUT AS WE GET INTO. HOPEFULLY SUMMER AND FALL THAT THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE IN THE BDGET SUB FIVE COMMITTEE CAN DO TO TALK A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVELY AND I HEARING FASHION ABOUT THAT SO THAT THE- LEGISLATURE UNDERSTANDS- THIS THE STRATEGY AROUND CAPACITY AND HAVE AND WE'RE- HAPPY TO SEE- A DECREASING POPULATION- AND THE LESSENING OF OVERCROWDING IN OUR PRISONS- THAT'S A GOOD THING- I DO WANT TO JUST SAY. AS IT RELATES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SPEND. A LOT OF TIME WILL HARDLY IF ANY EXIT MAKING REFERENCE TO THE FACT OF THE- PANDEMIC IN THE TRANSFER OF ALL INMATES. ARM AND IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A LOT OF THE REACTION AND COMMENT. IN THE BACK UP THAT OUR STAFF WORK SO HARD TO PREPARE FOR US WAS THAT THIS WAS REALLY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FEDERAL RECEIVER. I HOWEVER I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ACTUAL TRANSFER WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CDCR STAFF. AND THERE SEEM TO BE SOME INDICATION THAT THERE WERE. INDIVIDUALS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH ARENA THAT HAD CONCERNS AND POINTED THIS OUT. SO WHILE THE RESPONSIBILITY MAY BELONG TO THE FEDERAL RECEIVER I JUST WANNA MAKE A POINT THAT- I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT THAT ANSWER TO THE DEGREE THAT. I THINK THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP AND- THE PRACTICE OF HELL THAT TRANSIT THOSE TRANSFERS HAPPEN IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CDC ARE SO I WILL JUST. LEAVE IT AT THAT- YOU MADE A COMMENT WHICH I REALLY WAS IMPRESSED WITH ABOUT. US BEING AHEAD OF THE GAME R. AS IT RELATED TO SOME OF THE TESTING ISSUES AND SOME OF THE PROTOCOLS. AND I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I SAW EVIDENCE OF THAT WHEN I HAD OF PRIOR CONVERSATION- WITH CDC ARE. I HOWEVER THINK SOME OF THAT IS OVERSHADOWED BY THE SITUATION OF THE TRANSFERS AND I HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER SITUATION LIKE THIS PANDEMIC THAT. TEST YOU ON THAT BUT I DO THINK YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE ARE REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO. LIVE THAT DOWN AND- WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES- SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU GAVE TO ME AND PARTICULARLY SOME OF THE THINGS YOU SHARED RELATED TO EXPERIENCES- IN YOUR LONG CAREER- THROUGH CDC ARE WHICH REALLY INFORMS ME ABOUT YOUR- AND MY MIND YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR- COMMITMENT AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO DO THIS. SO YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT TODAY ARM AND AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW THAT I HAVE THE ABILITY TO- AND I WILL ASK YOU TO RE COMMIT. THAT YOU WILL MEET WITH US ON A FAIRLY REGULAR BASIS AS THE FORMER SECRETARY DID. SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT OPEN DIALOGUE ON A REGULAR BASIS ON ISSUES THAT CONCERN US AND IF YOU WOULD JUST. CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO DO THAT- THEN I WILL COULD CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MA'AM ABSOLUTELY I'M COMMITTED TO MEETING WITH- ANY ANY MEMBER COLLECTIVELY AS A GROUP WHEN WHENEVER NEEDED. AND FRANKLY AT REGULAR SCHEDULED MEETINGS IS OFTEN TIMES THAT THE MAYBE THE BEST OPTION BUT ALWAYS AVAILABLE. ANYTIME SECRETARY THANK YOU.

I THIS MIGHT NOT BE A MADE. BORN CALIFORNIA MY SPENT THE- BALANCE OF MY ADULT LIFE SERVING THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A CIVIL SERVANT. MUCH OF THAT TIME HAS BEEN AND COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AT EVERY LEVEL. FROM PRE TRIAL SERVICES TO. A JUVENILE SUPERVISION TO ADULT SUPERVISION- AND MUCH OF THAT TIME SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND WITH THE CALIFORNIA. OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. I SAY THAT- I'M TO SHOW THAT I HAVE HAND KNOWLEDGE. OF VALUE AND THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT FEDERAL SERVICES BRING TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN OUR BEST MOMENTS PRO AGENTS SERVE AS A SAFETY NET FOR THE MOST MARGINALIZED. AND THE SERVICE ADVOCATES FOR THOSE BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON TO BE GIVEN A FAIR SECOND CHANCE. BUT THEY DO THIS BY PREPARING FOR THE RELEASE. OF MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME. AND BY SITTING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS IN THEIR HOMES TO DETERMINE. WHAT WHAT NEEDS- THIS FORMERLY INCARCERATED HAVE. ALONE IN ORDER TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND TO AND TO REALLY BE WHO THEY ALWAYS WANTED TO BE NOT FOR THE MISTAKES OF BUT THEM- TO PRISON- WITH THAT BACKDROP AGENTS ROSS ON THE FRONTLINE OF SAY. WIENER BEING BREAK THE SIDE OF DOMESTIC BY. PREVENTING FURTHER BACK. ABSOLUTE MOST BAR AND- I'M ALSO. NOT BLIND TO THE FACT THAT IN OUR WORST MOMENTS THE PUBLIC PERCEIVES- COROLLAS IN DIFFERENT OR MAYBE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE DIFFICULT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN. LAW ENFORCEMENT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND THE AREAS OF RACE POVERTY AND GENDER. BUT THAT'S NOT LIBERAL I KNOW THAT'S NOT THE POOL THAT MIGHT LEAD. MANAGER RECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS I INTEND ON. CONTINUING THE REFORMS ALREADY UNDERWAY TO ENHANCE THE CONNECTIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH FAMILIES OF THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED. THE WAY THAT WE WORK IN CONCERT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOW WE BRING NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS TO THE TABLE AS DECISION MAKERS- MY FOCUS WILL BE TO TACKLE THOSE FACTORS THAT THREATEN REINTEGRATION NAMELY BOTTOM CLAREMONT. DIFFICULTY IN FINDING HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR THOSE RELEASED UNDER OUR CARE. I'LL STOP THERE BECAUSE OF THE TIME BUT WELCOME. QUESTIONS YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR OPEN COM. A. N. DOT LET GO AHEAD AND WITH SOME LAYER- AND DIRECT YOUR T THE SPA. OF INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH N. NINE APPRECIATE CHANCE TO MEET WITH- ALL THREE OF YOU I JUST- YOU I WAS GONNA MAKE A CALM ABOUT HOW YOU THE WHITE DIDN'T WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THE TIME YOU WANT TO PRESENT A BILL WAS RIGHT BEFORE EVERYBODY HAD TO RUN OUT TO CATCH A FLIGHT BECAUSE THAT NOBODY WOULD TALK. AND THEY WOULD JUST PASS IT AND SO ARE HOPEFULLY. YOU BENEFIT FROM THIS OF THE SAME WAY. THERE ARE NO FLIGHTS TODAY. I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT FLIGHT IN THE PRESENT DISCUSSION. OF IT LET ME START WITH RON DAVIS OF BECAUSE- MISTER DAVIS YOUR JOB HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR FIRE CAMPS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT- EARLIER TODAY. AND ARE COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE NUMBER FAR CAMPS- WHETHER YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO COME INTO THE- HOW THEY WORK WHETHER YOU'RE LEAVING THOSE WHERE THEY ARE. OVER TIME JUST GIVE US A GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FIRE CAMPS IN THE SYSTEM. ACTUALLY YOU SENATOR SO CURRENTLY HAVE THIRTY FIVE- FIRE CAMPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND WITH THE CLOSURE OF PROPOSED CLOSURE OF CCC THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER- THE CAMPS ALL THE CAMPS ARE GONNA STAY OPEN CURRENTLY THE CAMPS ARE SUPPORTED BY TWO INSTITUTIONS- BEEN ORGANISED SEVEN CAPS ARE SUPPORTED BY- ZERO CONSERVATION CENTER CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL CENTER- WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO THAT ARE LOCATED ON SITE AT DIFFERENT FACILITIES- WHAT IT CALIFORNIA MEN'S COLONY WANTED. THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC CENTER. BUT DIRECTOR OF THE OR LOOK- THROUGHOUT THE STATES OF BY THE TWO FACILITIES WITH THE CLOSURE THAT SUPPORT IS NOW GONNA FALL SO CON CENTER OF THE SUPPORT AND TRAINING OF OUR OF OUR FIVE FIRE CREWS WILL WILL BE SUPPORTED BY SEC- SO WE'RE NOT CLOSING ANYMORE CAMPUS- THE CARE POPULATIONS DOWN RIGHT NOW- PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT. TOOK A LOT OF THE- THE POSSIBLE POTENTIAL VOLUNTEERS FOR THAT PROGRAM I MEAN THEY'RE NOT IN OUR SYSTEM ANY LONGER SO WE'VE LOOKED VERY THOUGHTFULLY AT OUR CRITERIA. WE RECENTLY EXPANDED THE CRITERIA FROM FIVE YEARS TRYING TO SERVE EIGHT YEARS TIME TO SERVE TO INCREASE THAT THAT POOL OF CANDIDATES- WE ALSO LOOK AT INCENTIVES- TO TRY AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE. TO TO VOLUNTEER FOR THAT PROGRAM- ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN- ALLOWS FOR A CERTAIN OFFENSES TO HAVE THEIR OFFENDERS TO HAVE THEIR- RECORDS EXPUNGED IF THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY PULL COMPLETE COMPLETED THE FIREFIGHTER PROGRAM PARTICIPATED IN THE FIREFIGHTER PROGRAM- SO WERE WERE REALLY PUBLICIZING THAT OUT TO THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES TO TRY AND TO TRY AND DRAW THAT IN- THE GREAT THING IF SOMEBODY- IS ABLE TO GET THAT GET THAT RECORD EXPUNGED THEY MAKE ONE. ONE MISTAKE IN THEIR LIFE- AND TO BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING TO GET THAT THEIR RECORDS CLEARED SILVA DATA DEFINED BY THAT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE THAT'S A PRETTY BIG INCENTIVE- SO WE'RE REALLY WE'RE REALLY GOING AFTER THAT- ENGINE. JUST LOOKING AT THE CAR BUT YOU'VE GOT A REALLY BAD PUBLIC SAFETY- IN MAKING SURE THAT YOUR PUTTING PUTTING PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THOSE FIRE CAMPS BECAUSE IT IS THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF FREEDOM OUT THERE THAT IT IS. A SAFE ENVIRONMENT SAFE FOR THE PUBLIC SO BALANCING THAT- IS VERY IMPORTANT- AS FAR AS POPULATION RIGHT NOW HAS BEEN IMPACTED- BY KOBE- SECRETARY MINUTE MENTIONED- YOU KNOW AROUND THOUSAND WAITING IN COUNTY JAILS TO COME INTO OUR PRISON SYSTEM- WE ALSO HAVE MANY SITTING IN A RECEPTION CENTERS- THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO GET UP INTO OUR INDOOR CAMP TRAINING PROGRAM SO- JUST ALL OF THE MOVEMENT.

ONE OF MY LOCAL WHAT WENT INTO THE JURISDICTION A LOT OF THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S INVOLVED A HOLDER COORDINATION THING TO GET THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO IT. WHAT MAY I ASK MR BORG. OF JUST. OUR OUR GIVEN YOUR FISTS. ARE ARE THE- BEEN A- ABOUT THE NEW FOR NEW FOR SO OR- DOWN EXIST ONES. JUST A BRIEF ON THE SUB OF THE FOR MAKE. WHAT DO YOU HAVE BEEN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ARE YOU UP TO DATE A HOW DOES THAT WORK IN THIS. I THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THAT QUESTION- WE DO TRACK I DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AS IDENTIFIED- BY EACH PRISON- THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM- WE USE THAT AND MEET WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE- WHERE ARE DOLLARS SHOULD BE SPENT- SINCETHE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS WILL TAKE SEVERAL YEARS TO PLAN AND CONSTRUCT WERE ALWAYS. TRYING TO LOOK OUT A TWO TO THREE YEARS AND SEEING WHERE THE NEEDS ARE ARE MOST ACUTE SO THAT WE CAN- EIGHT. AT YOUR DRESS ADDRESS SITUATIONS- BEFORE THEY GET WORSE- OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE MAIN- BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM IS A ROOF REPLACEMENT PROGRAM- WHICH IS- GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY- IMPROVING. CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM- WELL AS FAR AS THE WAY WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT- WITH TO PRISON CLOSURES AND- THE LOWER POPULATION- WITH BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT OUR- FACILITY NEEDS DOWN THE ROAD. AND BE ABLE TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T INVEST A LAWLER LOT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN CERTAIN PLACES IF THEY ARE LIKELY TO CLOSE SO WE ARE INCREASING- OUR INTERNAL MEETINGS. WE'VE ALWAYS MET WITH- VERY STAKEHOLDERS A DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS- AND- THERE'S NO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND- THE MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE- SIDE OF THE- C. C. H. C. S. ORGANIZATION- WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING- TO INCREASE OUR MEETINGS WITH UNDER SECRETARY LEVEL- SO THAT WHEN WE'RE- PREPARING TO MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS- IN. IN EACH FISCAL YEAR THAT- WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS SMARTLY- KNOWING WHAT THAT THAT THERE'S UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE SO LET'S MAXIMIZE AND THE. PRIORITIZE WHERE ARE DOLLARS TO GO. GREAT YOU VERY. AND THEN LET ME. A MAN VIA ROSS. ARE WE TO. OF THIS MORNING JIM ABOUT. THE CHANGES ADULTS. WITH THE- BEING DOWN. AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE REMAINING POPULATION IS.

ON MANY YEARS OF AND I WAS REFERRED TO WEAR HER ITEM OF FRIENDS WERE PRO. AGENTS ALSO WITH FROM OF OUR- FIFTY OUT OF WE WERE WORKING TO N OUT THE DIFFERENT JOB. I'M CONCERN ABOUT THE OF THE. I RECEIVED. I READ THAT CORRECTLY IF YOU ARE READING IT CORRECTLY THANK YOU SIR BATES UP HERE REFERENCING- WITH WITH ANY SUPERVISION AND CITY THERE'S A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE FOUNDERS THAT- DO NOT REPORT CHRISTY PROVISION OR SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR SUPERVISION PERIOD AND THEY HAVE SPAWNED I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERENCING THE FACT THAT- VISION OF ADULT CROSS. IS HOVERING SOMEWHERE IN THE LOW SIX THOUSAND AND TERMS OF- FOLKS WITH THAT WE HAVE ACTIVE WARRANTS AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR- WARRANTS THAT. I'M GOING TO THE COMMON LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM- WE HAVE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR SEVEN DAY A WEEK. WARRANT SYSTEMS MURDERED DISPATCH SYSTEM WHAT WE PROVIDE INFORMATION TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THEY CALL IN- IN THE EVENT THEY- ARE ABLE TO LOCATE THESE FOLKS. I'M NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT NUMBER OF COURSE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. SUPERVISION SERVICES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL THOSE THAT ARE. UNDER CROSS. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN NUMBER THAT- DESPITE ANY EFFORTS- THE DUDE'S GONE PROSCRIPTION AND ONCE THAT HAPPENS WE DON'T STOP LOOKING FOR THEM. WE DO HOPE TO BRING THEM BACK INTO THE SUPERVISION FULL THAT SOME POINT- OF COURSE THE PANDEMICS HAS MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT- I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING WITH REGARD TO NUMBER WHEN I NOTICED THAT I JUST THOUGHT THAT THAT COULD BE REALLY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL PAROLE AGENTS AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOAD DO THEY GET A FIFTH AND FALL WITH THE FOLLOW UP ON THEM BECAUSE THE JOB IS ALREADY DIFFICULT AND HAVING TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOCATING. WHATEVER THE GIVEN NUMBER IN A DIFFERENT YOU KNOW SPECIFIC CAPABILITY IF THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO HAVE A SEPARATE OF DIVISION OR A FINE NEEDS TO FOLLOW UP ON THOSE WHO ARE REPORTED MISSING FROM THE INDIVIDUALS CAREFUL. AS A PART OF REGULAR PAROLE SUPERVISION. IS DOING FOLLOW UPS AND TRYING TO FIND THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE. WARRANTS HOWEVER- WE HAVE PRIDE OF THE PANDEMIC. HAVE A POOL APPREHENSION TEAM. SOLELY DEDICATED TO LOOKING FOR PORTION OF THOSE FOLKS WERE DISCUSSING. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION ALSO HAS A SEPARATE FUGITIVE APPREHENSION TEAM. THAT IS NOT PART OF THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS AND OUR MISSION IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT- BUT THEY O LOOK FOR- SOME OF THOSE HIGHER RISK. CRUELTIES AT LARGE GROUPS CONNORS IT MAY ALSO BE INVOLVED OR WANT TO. JURISDICTIONS FALLING. ONGOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. WELL THANKS FOR THAT I WAS LOOKING AT IT IN OF THE BURDEN THAT THAT MIGHT BE ON THE INDIVIDUAL- PEARL AGENTS AND WHETHER YOU ARE ACTUALLY SAVE DID YOU NEED A LITTLE MORE MONEY. IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA TO ENSURE THAT YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT COULD DO THE FOLLOW UP WHILE THE A FINE JOB THE AGENT WAS TAKING CARE OF. OF THOSE WHO WERE COMPLYING AYE I HAD A BILL MANY YEARS AGO REGARDING THE TRANSIENT SLUGGED OUT WITHOUT TO- MOVE AROUND A LOT NOT NOT TO AND I GUESS THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT AGAIN BUT- GIVE AND NOW WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH HOMELESS POPULATION AND ALL THE PRESSURES THAT ARE THERE IT JUST AND HOUSING. INDIVIDUALS THAT COULD ADD TO THAT PARTICULAR BURDEN SO ANYWAY JUST DIED. VERY INTERESTING AND OUT OF CERTAINLY KEEP A PHONE THE PRICE OF THAT BECAUSE WITH OF I THINK OF THE DIFFICULT AREA AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT SHOULDN'T BE A BLOTCH ON. A WHAT A BLACK MARK ON WHAT YOU ALL ARE DOING BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE SO INVOLVED THESE DAYS WITH. THE REFORM EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON THE REHABILITATION EFFORTS THAT ARE GOING ON WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TOUCH ALL OF THEM.

CLOSURES AND THAT WITH- YEAH YOU HEARD PROBABLY A VERY IN DEPTH DISCUSSION ABOUT WITH- IF A WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE SO I'M NOT MONEY TO GO BACK THROUGH THAT BUT GET YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON THE BALLOT IN. CONFIRMING THAT THE FIRE TRAINING CAMP IS IN FACT NOT BEING CLOSE THAT I DID I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY THAT WAS KIND OF IN THIS. COMMUNICATION. OR MISINTERPRETATION. WHENEVER TO A TWO YEAR MISTER AGAIN MISTER DAVIS INTERNAL. INVOLVED FOR SO. MISTER BARKER YOU GO- AND THEN FOLLOWED UP BY MISTER DAVIS THANK YOU. YES THANK US SENATOR- YES WE DID- OBVIOUSLY WE WERE ON- ON THIS HEARING- FOR THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SECRETARY ALISON SO ALL OF THE POINTS- REGARDING THE IMPACT OF COMMUNITY- ARE ARE TAKEN TO HEART- I HEY I HAVE I'M ONE OF MANY CONTRIBUTING ROLES- TO THE PRISON CLOSURE DECISIONS- I DO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE CONDITIONS OF THE PRISONS AND- FUTURE PLANS- THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED- BUT I'M ONE OF THOSE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TOGETHER TO REACH EVENTUAL CLOSURE DECISIONS SO- FOR IN THE FUTURE AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT- I OBVIOUSLY A SECTOR ALLISON'S GONNA. WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE IMPROVE OUR NOTIFICATION PATTERNS AND- CAN HAVE BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF THE COMMUNITY- I BELIEVE THAT MISTER DAVIS HAS A MUCH MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION RELATED TO THE PARK AND TRAINING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- SO THE FIRE CAMP THERE'S A FIRE CAMP THAT'S LOCATED ON SITE AND WILL CAMPUS LOCATED ON SITE- I'M IN SUSANVILLE THE FIRE CAMP IN THAT AREA IS THAT BACK CAMPUS STAYING OPEN THE TRAINING PORTION FOR TRAINING FIREFIGHTERS HAPPENS WITHIN THE PRISON ITSELF THE TRAINING PORTION. IS GOING TO BE CLOSING IN ALL OF THE TRAINING WILL BE HAPPENING DOWN AT SIERRA CONSERVATION CENTER DOWN IN JAMESTOWN. THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION WHY DID ASK SECRETARY ALISON FOR SOME INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO ME IN WRITING REGARDING THE ISSUES ON NON THE IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITIES ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES AND I KNOW YOU'LL ALL BE COLLABORATING ON THE OUT SOLE. I WAIT TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM ALL OF YOU AND THAT FROM ABOUT ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE. FOR THIS AFTERNOON BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK BOTH OF YOU ALL THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN OUR STATE. AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN INCARCERATED OF BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK SO THEY CAN CERTAINLY ENJOY- OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE GREAT STATE PROVIDES EDUCATION WISE FONG OCCUPATION LIES PROFESSION GETTING PEOPLE. WHO UNFORTUNATELY FELL INTO YOUR SUPERVISION BACK WITH- THEY ARE COMMUNITIES TO CONTRIBUTE CHEN AND THEM WANTING TO CERTAINLY PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I KNOW YOU'RE ALL VERY DEDICATED TO THAT PARTICULAR OUTCOME SO THANK YOU AND- WE'LL BE TALKING BEFORE WE THIS COMES BEFORE. ON THE SENATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ASANA GROWTH BEFORE YOU HAVE TO SCOOT BACK OVER TO HEALTH LET ME LET YOU GO. NETTING'S YOUTH MADAM PROVED HIM AND I DO APOLOGIZE IF THESE QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. I'VE BEEN KIND OF BOUNCING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN AND COMMITTEES. I DO HAVE SOME- WHO- QUESTIONS FOR IT- DIRECTOR AT VERO SAYS. AND MAYBE ONE OR TWO FOR OTHERS- I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS FROM LOS ANGELES REGARDING- HER QUESTIONS- WITH MISS ALICE AND- I'M AND I WASN'T AWARE OF THIS- I WASN'T AWARE OF THE FACT THAT CONTRACTS THAT ARE MADE WHERE PEOPLE MAKE THINGS ARE HAVE YOU KNOW- THINGS DONE IN PRISON THEY HAVE A LOWER WAGE AND THEN WHEN THEY GET OUT. THOSE COMPANIES I REFUSE TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS I'M I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT AS IT IS THE BEST. SOLUTION FOR RECIDIVISM RECIDIVISM AND POVERTY IS A JOB AND THAT IF PEOPLE HAVE A JOB THAT GIVES THEM A SENSE OF SELF WORTH AND ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND SO MY QUESTION IS THAT DO YOU HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME O THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THOSE CONTRACTS WITH CDC ARE- WELL PEOPLE IN PRISON IF YOU DO OR YOUR TEAM DOES WHAT'S YOUR OUTREACH PLANS SO THAT WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS GET OUT OF PRISON. THEY CAN GO APPLY FOR THOSE JOBS AND- THE- THE- CONTRARY TO MY COLLEAGUE IN LOS ANGELES- PURPOSES AS WELL I DON'T THINK IN PRISON THEY SHOULD MAKE. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY ROOF I MEAN I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THAT. BUT I THINK THAT IF THEY GO TO APPLY AFTER THEY GET OUT OF PRISON AND THEY'VE ALREADY SHOWN THAT THEY CAN DO THE WORK THAT THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE A CONSIDERATION AND SO WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SOME OF THESE CONTRACTORS THAT ACTUALLY I DO THIS WORK. AND WHY IS IT THAT THEY DO NOT OFFER- THESE- EMPLOYEES- JOBS SINCE THEY'VE BEEN DOING THE WORK FOR. SO MANY YEARS. THANK YOU CENTER GOODBYE. I CONCUR WITH YOUR- ASTUTE- COMMENT THAT. THE EMPLOYMENT IS CRITICAL BE ABLE TO RE INTEGRATE SOME OF THESE FOLKS AND THAT MANY TIMES- WE SEE THAT- ONE OF THE CRITICAL FACTORS FOR. LEADING OTHERS UNDER SUPERVISION BACK INTO CUSTODY REALLY FOR FALL AROUND AREAS OF POVERTY AND HAVING THE ABILITY. TO HAVE APPLICABLE SKILLS. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK I CAN COMMENT TOO MUCH ON THE INCLUDES THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU I'M I'M I JUST DON'T. I'M GONNA OF WHO THEY- MY- AM OPEN TO RECEIVING INFORMATION BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT- THE EFFORTS THAT THE DIVISIONAL PRO OPERATION UNDERTAKES FIND- SUSTAINABLE PAINT JOBS- WE GO TO GREAT LENGTHS AN EFFORTS IN TERMS OF BOTH EMPLOYABILITY AND HAVING FOLKS OUT- PROGRESS WITH THEIR ACADEMIC SKILLS THAT ARE SORT OF A- A- FACTOR TO THEN BE TRAINED AND BECOME EMPLOYED LONG TERM. WE HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH- OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES LIKE THE DEPARTMENT REHABILITATION- ONE OF. THE GREATEST ENDEAVORS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THE VENTURA. TRAINING CENTER WHICH IS A FIRE. FIGHTER TRAINING CENTER- THAT. WAS ESTABLISHED TO ASSIST WITH TRAINING FORMALLY INCARCERATED BE ABLE JOIN THOSE RANKS IT'S A RESIDENTIAL LONG TERM PROGRAM IN WHICH THEY RECEIVED A TRAINING- I HAD GREAT SUCCESS IN THEIR EMPLOYABILITY AND BOTH THE FIRE FIGHTING FIELD AND EMPLOYMENT IN OTHER SECTORS. SO WE ARE EYEING PERSONALLY ALWAYS WILLING TO MEET WITH FOLKS THAT CAN HELP THEM FIND EMPLOYMENT OR TRAINING FOR OUR POPULATION- I CERTAINLY THINK THAT. IT IT IT FOLLOWS IT WOULD BE DIRECTOR ANY TRAINING THEY RECIEVED IN A PRISON- FOR US AND CRUEL TO ASSIST- THOSE UNDER OUR SUPERVISION AND FINDING EMPLOYMENT AS BEST WE CAN- BUT IN TERMS OF SPECIFICS AT YOUR QUESTION I DON'T THINK I. CAN COMMENT THAT'S OKAY AM I JUST WAS CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR YOUR TEAM'S RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE CONTRACTORS AND IF YOU DID KNOW- WHY THEY WOULDN'T EMPLOYEES INDIVIDUALS- THAT ALREADY SKILLED IN THAT SPECIFIC JOB- ONCE THEY GOT OUT OF PRISON TO HELP THEM ACHIEVE THE- MORE POSITIVE LIFE- I DO KNOW THAT- I MEAN I DO KNOW I MEAN WE HAVE WE HAVE A RANCH PROPERTY IN OUR FAMILY THERE IS A FIRE ON IT AND WE HAD A IN MEAT- FIREFIGHTERS THERE AND- THEY WORKED. ALONGSIDE OUR CAL FIRE AND THEY WORK JUST AS HARD AND JUST AS LONG AND THEY DID A REALLY GOOD JOB I ALSO KNOW THAT TIME WE HAD A LOT OF POORLY TRANSFERS FROM LOS ANGELES TO WORK IN THE OIL INDUSTRY BECAUSE IN THE OIL INDUSTRY IN KERN COUNTY- THERE'S A LOT OF JOBS WERE YOU CAN MAKE A REALLY GOOD LIVING. AND DEAD YOU CAN KEEP YOURSELF OUT OF TROUBLE AND YOU CAN AND- AS LONG AS YOU CAN SHOW UP ON TIME AND TAKEN DIRECTION RIGHT THAT'S WHAT THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS ARE SO. AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AND DEVELOP EMPLOYMENT AND FOR INDIVIDUALS ONCE THEY'RE RELEASED- BECAUSE- THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKING SURE THAT THEY DON'T GO BACK. I DO HAVE- A QUESTION. FOR THANK YOU SIR FOR THAT. I APPRECIATE THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR. MISTER DAVIS. THREE DAVIS THEIR- YES HE IS THERE OKAY ON THE- ON THE- MISTER DAVIS THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY- YOU HAVE OVERSIGHT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY OF TEN ADULT INSTITUTIONS AND THIRTY FIVE FIRE CAMPS INCLUDING THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY IN OTAY MESA. A RECENT TWO PART INVESTIGATIVE REPORT FROM- IN NEW SERVICE HIGHLIGHTED- THAT R. J. DONOVAN HAD THE WORST TRACK RECORD AMONG THE PRISONS FOR ITS RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING THREE INMATES THAT WERE FOUND UNRESPONSIVE IN THEIR CELLS. AND. WHAT'S YOUR ROLE IN OVERSEEING THE R. J. DONOVAN AND OTHER- PRISONS AND DO YOU RESPONSIBILITY IN RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THAT. I MEAN I WOULD THINK THAT THAT EVEN WITH OUR EARLY BAD CHECKS OR YOU KNOW AND. AGAIN I'VE TOURED SEVERAL PRISONS IN- KERN COUNTY. AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY I WOULD THINK THAT SOMEONE WOULD NOTICE THAT SOMEONE WAS ON THE FLOOR AND RESPONSIVE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- SO YES I AM OVER- AS YOU MENTIONED TEN TEN FACILITIES INCLUDING R. J. DONOVAN AS WELL AS A THIRTY FIVE FIRE CAMPS- I MAKE REGULAR TOURS DOWN TO ALL OF THE FACILITIES- TAKING A LOOK AT YOU KNOW. BE COMPLIANCE- WALKING TALKING TO STAFF AND POPULATION- ARE COATED OR COMPUTER RESPONSE IS REALLY A JOINT EFFORT WITH OUR PARTNERS FROM HEALTH CARE- AND WITH WITH NURSING ROUNDS WITH CUSTODY ROUNDS-CHECKING. CHECKING ON- THE INCARCERATED POPULATION- AS WELL AS AS WELL AS DOING TESTING WHEN SOMEONE IS IDENTIFIED AS BEING POSITIVE MOVING THEM INTO THE TO THE APPROPRIATE ISOLATION UNIT SO AS NOT TO INFECT OTHERS- WHEN PEOPLE POTENTIALLY COULD BE. AT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED MOVING THEM INTO A QUARANTINE AREA SO THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO- ACTUALLY EXPOSE ANYONE ELSE- B. B. THE STAFF DOWN THERE- I THINK DEALING WITH THE SITUATION- AND THE VOLUME THAT THEY THAT THEY WERE HIT WITH IT ONCE- IF THEY HAD A VERY DAY IT WAS A VERY CHALLENGING TIME FOR THEM- I CAN'T SPEAK TO THOSE THOSE PARTICULAR CASES- BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE STAFF ARE DILIGENT GOING AND CHECKING- ON THE WELFARE OF THE POPULATION- AND MEDICAL AS WELL AS THE NURSES GOING AROUND TO DOING THEIR ROUNDS- BUT I CAN'T I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS ON THOSE. ON THOSE CASES THAT YOU MENTION. OKAY THANK YOU I'M AND SO- THERE ARE ALSO CONCERNS RAISED BY THE FAMILY AS I'M INDIVIDUALS IN THE RICHARD J. DONOVAN CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AND THAT IT WAS WEEKS- SEVERAL WEEKS GOING INTO MONTHS BEFORE THEY WERE EVEN NOTIFIED THAT THEIR RELATIVE OR FAMILY MEMBER WAS- ILL OR HAD CONTRACTED COVERT NOW. I'M NOT I AM NOT CASTING ANY BLAME MY I KNOW THAT COOLEY TOOK EVERYBODY BY SURPRISE PEOPLE HAD TO ADAPT IMMEDIATELY- IN A JUST AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN YOU KNOW DO DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY MET THE GUIDELINES THAT THEY DID WHAT THEY HAD TO DO TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE- BUT- I. I JUST THINK THAT- I MEAN. IF SOMEBODY IN MY BUSINESS- IN MY EMPLOYMENT IN THE REAL WORLD- GOT CO WOULD BE NOTIFIED AT A FANCY WE NOTIFY PEOPLE INSTANTLY LIKE. ACTUALLY I THINK THAT THEY STARTED A LOT OF REQUIRED US TO DO WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. RT EXECUTIVE ORDER- AT. IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT. A WITH EVERYBODY AT CDC ARE IN A STATE RUN FACILITY THAT THAT IT TOOK WEEKS TO NOTIFY- ANYBODY THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBER WAS ILL CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. AGAIN TO MISTER DAVIS I APOLOGIZE. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- AS FAR AS NOTIFICATION OF THE FAMILY- THAT'S NORMALLY- ONLY GONNA BE DONE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE SENT TO LIKE AN OUTSIDE HOSPITAL- THE ILLNESS ITSELF MANY MANY OF THE- OF THE POPULATION WHO. WHO WERE TESTING POSITIVE- FOR A SYMPTOMATIC AND STILL HAD ACCESS TO- TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE FAMILY MEMBERS THEMSELVES IF THERE WERE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO- AGAIN I DON'T I DON'T HAVE SPECIFICS ON ON THE INDIVIDUALS. WERE THE COMPLAINTS CAME FROM- SO IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPEAK ON SPECIFIC SITUATIONS BUT IN IN MOST SITUATIONS- WHERE WE DID HAVE CODED- THE POPULATION STILL DID HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THEIR FAMILY- EVEN WITHIN- THE QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION UNITS. THANK YOU ON MY LAST QUESTION I HAVE IS ON BEHALF OF MY THREE SHERIFF'S. ST TO M. MY DISTRICT IS SO BIG IT SPREADS OVER THREE COUNTIES AND THEY'RE ALL THREE IN THE SAME POSITION AND- HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SENTENCED TO PRISON THAT REMAINING CALLIE COUNTY JAILS DUE TO THE SUSPENSION OF INTAKE DURING COVERT NINETEEN. AND DEM. ANNA NGUYEN. ARE YOU GONNA RESUME INTAKE. MISTER DAVIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR- THE NUMBER IS AROUND TEN THOUSAND I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT FIGURE RIGHT NOW- WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING INTAKE AND WE'RE MAKING PLANS TO INCREASE INTAKE TO TRY AND HELP CLEAR THAT COUNTY BACKLOG- AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE CHALLENGES OF KOBE AND WITH WITH THE- TESTING REQUIREMENTS IN QUARANTINE REQUIREMENTS UPON RECEIPT- AS WELL AS TRYING TO GET THAT MOVEMENT BACK OUT OF RECEPTION CENTER FOLLOWING. A RECEPTION CENTRE PROCESSING- KOBE JUST ADDS A WHOLE NOTHER LAYER OF CHALLENGES ON TO THAT BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING INTAKE- IT'S BEING COORDINATED WEEKLY- AND COUNTY BY COUNTY ARRANGEMENTS ARE MADE TO AND TAKE WHAT WE CAN WHAT WE HAVE SPACE FOR- AND THAT SPACES JUST GENERALLY DICTATED BY. SPACE FOR QUARANTINE. AND SO I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE- I DO BUT I NEED TO SUBMIT TO YOU THAT OUR LOCAL COUNTY JAILS IN OUR COUNTY COMMUNITIES ARE NOT AND- AS LONG TERM FACILITIES. THEY ARE FOR SHORT TERM- EVEN YOU KNOW THEIR SHORT TERM FACILITIES AND- SO THE PANDEMIC WHEN YOU SAY WE'RE NOT TAKING AT DO DOING INTAKE BECAUSE CODE AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW US- PEOPLE ARE STILL BEING ASSIGNED TO THAT COUNTY JAIL. AND THEY HAVE FAR FEWER FACILITIES AND FAR FEWER. ARE FAR LESS SPACE. THAN YOU DO AT- ONE OF YOUR- PRISONS THAT YOU OVERSEAS SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO. TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. MISTER DAVIS. YES THANK YOU SENATOR- AS I STATED WE ARE WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON A PLAN- TO INCREASE OUR INTAKE TO ASSIST WITH THAT COUNTY BACKLOG SO WE CAN HAVE. SO WE CAN. I BELIEVE IT THAT PROBLEM FOR THE COUNTIES I'M WORKING WITH OUR HELP HEALTH CARE PARTNERS- ON OUR ON OUR MOVIE MATRIX SO THAT WE CAN GET THE NECESSARY INTERNAL MOVEMENT TO CLEAR THE SPACE TO DO THAT COUNTY INTAKE I AM THANK YOU DOES THAT PLAN INCLUDE ANY FUTURE PANDEMIC RESPONSES SO THAT THE COUNTIES AREN'T ABSORBING- AGAIN IN IN LESS SPACE AND LESS ADEQUATE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE A COUNTY JAIL NOT A FULL PRISON SYSTEM- IS FUTURE PANDEMICS OUR FUTURE ISSUES THAT WE MAY FACE- I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT YOU GUYS JUST HAVE THE ABILITY SAY NO WE'RE NOT TAKING THEM. BUT THEY'RE STILL GETTING THEM SO AND DO YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT TO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN AGAIN OR IS THAT PART OF YOUR PLAN. THANK YOU SENATOR- I THINK WE'VE ALL LEARNED A LOT WE'RE STILL LEARNING FROM WHAT WE'VE GONE THROUGH WITH THE PANDEMIC OVER THE PAST YEAR- I THINK WE CAN TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED AND PROBABLY BE MORE EFFICIENT GOING FORWARD- WHAT ANOTHER. POTENTIAL PANDEMIC COULD BRING TO US- IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE FUTURE MIGHT HOLD. GIVEN WHAT THAT MIGHT BE- BUT I THINK WE WE'VE WE'VE DEFINITELY LEARNED A LOT FROM FROM. THIS SITUATION. AND I THINK WE'RE I THINK WE'RE MUCH BETTER FOR IT OPERATIONALLY- SO I DEFINITELY THINK IT WILL HELP US IF WE'RE EVER FACED WITH SOMETHING. OF THIS NATURE AGAIN. I AM THANK YOU AGAIN I JUST WANT ARE JUST SUBMIT TO YOU THAT- YOUR FACILITIES ARE MORE HIGHLY QUALIFIED TO TAKE INDIVIDUALS. IN A PANDEMIC OR ANY OTHER EMERGENCY SITUATION. THEN YOU GUYS RECENT REFUSING TO RECEIVE THOSEINDIVIDUALS IN KEEPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS MORE CONFINED IN A COUNTY NON LONG TERM LOCATION. SO I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU GUYS LOOK AT A PLAN TO WHERE YOU'RE NOT PUTTING THE COUNTY JAILS- IN THAT POSITION. BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS IF AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE NEGATIVE BUT IT'S ALMOST AS IF YOU JUST WASH YOUR HANDS AND SAID. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TAKING THESE PEOPLE. AND IN YOU HAD A BETTER CAPACITY TO TAKE- DO INTAKE THEN KEEPING THOSE PEOPLE IN A COUNTY JAIL IN A SMALLER ENVIRONMENT- IT IS IN A LESS A SUFFICIENT ENVIRONMENT FOR WHAT- WHAT IS REQUIRED. AND SO PLEASE THINK ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR LONG TERM PLAN GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATTER PROTECT. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVE- SENATOR COM LONGER. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM I JUST HAVE A QUESTION I THINK FOR EACH OF THEM ALL START WITH- STERN BOARD WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT WATER- AND WE KNOW THAT- I THINK SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE PRESENCE OF OUR PRISONS HAVE BEEN CITED ALMOST TWO HUNDRED TIMES A FOR VIOLATING DRINKING WATER STANDARDS WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE STOCKTON FACILITY AND THE CONTAMINATED WATER THAT STILL PRESENT THEIR- IN I WOULD JUST LIKE A. M. A RESPONSE TO THAT CONCERN I. I THINK I HAD ASKED- AN ISSUE NOT JUST WITH THE FILTRATION SYSTEM BUT THE FACT THAT BOTTLED WATER- IS BEING- SHIPPED IN. WHEN THAT CDC OURS USING BOTTLED WATER AND SHOWER FILTERS AS A SHORT TERM RESPONSE- TO THIS ISSUE AND IN JOKES. IN JUST I THINK I ASKED IF- YOU WOULD DRINK THE WATER IN THE FACILITY BUT IT IS A DEEPER QUESTION ABOUT- HEALTH STANDARDS THERE- ARE PIPING OR PLUMBING SYSTEM THE CONTAMINATION THAT MAY BE FLOWING THROUGH. OUR PIPES AND WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE LIVING AND WORKING N THE PROGRAM PRISONS ARE SAFE- AND HAVE SAFE WATER. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND ON OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION- SO YOU'RE GOING BACK- TWO YEARS WHEN THE LEGIONELLA WAS FIRST DISCOVERED- AT THE STOCKTON FACILITY- NUMBER STEPS WERE TAKEN- ONE AND INCLUDED A I FOR CHLORINATION OF ALL OF THE- OF FACILITIES IN ORDER TO. OUR OF WRITTEN TRAIN AND- YOU KNOW SHOCK THE SYSTEM AND LIMIT. AS MUCH- LEGIONELLA AS POSSIBLE AT THAT POINT IN TIME WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED NEW MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES WHICH- WORKS TO LIMIT THE ABILITY FOR WATER TO BECOME STAGNANT WITHIN THE SYSTEM- AND THAT WAS- FUNDED WITH ADDITIONAL MAINTENANCE POSITIONS OF THESE ARE ADDITIONAL STATE EMPLOYEES. WHO ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT WE ARE ARE HAVING ADEQUATE WATER FLOW THERE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN- THE CHLORINE LEVELS WITHIN THE WATER. WE'VE ALSO- AS OF FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR BECAME OPERATIONAL WITH ADDITIONAL CHLORINATION EQUIPMENT THAT NOW HAS US AS A LICENSED- WATER PURVEYOR- AT C. H. CF IN STOCKTON. ARE THAT WILL ALSO ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR OUR LEVELS OF CHLORINE AND AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUED TO DO TESTING FOR LEGIONELLA. SO ON A MONTHLY BASIS WE DO TESTING FOR LEGIONELLA THROUGHOUT THE US SYSTEM AND THOSE I AM WITH THAT THROUGHOUT THE- PRESIDENT STOCKTON PARDON ME- AND THAT IS- THAT INFORMATION IS USED TO IDENTIFY WITH THE BUILDINGS. SHOULD BE ON WATER RESTRICTIONS ARE NOT SO NUMBER BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM WATER RESTRICTION BASED ON THE MONTHLY TESTING SHOWING ON A VERY LOW LEVELS OF LEGIONELLA- AND THOSE ARE BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH STANDARDS- AT THOSE LOCATIONS. OTHER ONES WHICH DO SHOW- HIGHER LEVELS OF BOTTLED WATER IS- UTILIZED IN THOSE BUILDINGS.BUT IN EVERY BUILDING ALL OF THE DRINKING FOUNTAINS AND ICE MACHINES THAT WOULD BE USED QUITE FREQUENTLY DO HAVE FILTERS MAKING THAT WATER US SAFE TO DRINK- IN THE SHOWERS OF COURSE OF HAVE THOSE FILTERS. BUT OUR OUR LONG TERM PLAN IS TO YOU NEED TO WORK THE MAIN. AND ESPECIALLY WITHIN. OF THE ADDITIONAL. OR THE NEXT TO TWELVE MONTHS WOULD BE ABLE TO- COMPARE. LEGIONELLA RESULTS GOING FORWARD WITH THE ADDITIONAL LET CHLORINE LEVELS TO THE SAME LEVELS A YEAR AGO BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO SEASONAL DIFFERENCES AS FAR AS WHEN LEGIONELLA MIGHT BE MORE- PRESENT ONE MIGHT BE MORE LIKELY TO PROPAGATE IN THE SYSTEMS. SO THOSE ARE ARE ARE ARE THE METHODS WERE DRESSING DOWN IT- STOCKED IN- ELSEWHERE IN THE SYSTEM A COUPLE OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- WE HAVE RECEIVED- INCREASED- MAINTENANCE FUNDING BOTH- ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDING. AND ALSO ONGOING ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FUNDING OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT IS pESPECIALLY ON CRITICAL ITEMS SUCH AS WATER. AND DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS WE ARE NOT LETTING MAINTENANCE OR REPAIRS LAG ON THOSE BUT MAKING SURE WE PRIORITIZE THOSE. ONE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE IS WE ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR- PRISONS OPERATE OFF OF THE MUNICIPAL WATER SYSTEM AND THAT WAS A SIMILAR SITUATION THERE AT STOCKTON- WE- HAVE IN. DONNA AUDIT OF THOSE PRISONS. SINCE OUR EXPERIENCES OF STOCKTON IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AT THOSE LOCATIONS MAKE SURE THE REGULAR TESTING OF CHLORINE LEVELS. AND- OTHER- BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GOING TO AVOID HAVING LEGIONELLA OR OTHER WATERBORNE INSTANCES OF THOSE LOCATIONS. THE OTHER TWO THIRDS OF OUR PRISONS HAVE- OPERATING OPERATE A WATER PLANT THAT'S ALREADY LICENSED BY THE DIVISION OF DRINKING WATER. AND WE FEEL- BETTER AT THOSE LOCATIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE ALREADY TESTING AND SENDING IN REGULAR REPORTS. TO THE A DIVISION OF. DRINKING WATER AT AT THOSE LOCATIONS. SO MY ASSUMPTION IS THAT AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THE WARDENS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE- THE MAINTENANCE OF THEIR- FACILITIES MAKING SURE THAT THINGS ARE CLEAN AND SAFE- BUT THAT. YOUR DIVISION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING THEM AND HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN ARE THEY SPOT CHECKS- ARE THERE SORT OF- ARE THEY- SCHEDULED VISIT SENATE HOW. ARE YOU DO YOU GO BASED ON COMPLAINTS THAT YOU GET I MEAN. AND I ASK BECAUSE AND I THINK I MENTIONED THIS IN OUR DISCUSSION- I RECEIVED PHOTOS OF CONDITIONS INSIDE- THE PRISONS. DURING COBIT AND- DEBTS IMAGES WERE AS SHOCKING AND- TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT IT LOOKED LIKE A TORNADO HAD HIT- INSIDE THE FACILITY AND SO JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW HOW THAT KIND OF MONITORING. HAPPENS. THANK YOU SENATOR- WE DO HAVE A REGIONAL MAINTENANCE MANAGERS ARE THERE ARE EMPLOYEES OF OUR DIVISION HERE THAT ARE SIGNED A GROUP OF- PRISONS- FIVE SIX SEVEN WILL- ROME ON A REGULAR BASIS TO GO OUT TO VISIT THAT PRISON- THEY MEET WITH THE STAFF OUT THERE TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. AWARE OF THEIR CONCERNS OF ANY SPECIAL NEEDS THEY HAVE- WE ALSO AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH YEAR- GET FROM THEM AN ANNUAL WORK PLAN WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A SPENDING BUDGET. SO THIS IS HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'RE ALLOCATING FOR REPAIRS THIS IS HOW MUCH ALEX REID THEY'RE ALLOCATING FOR DIFFERENT SERVICES AND FOR DIFFERENT CONTRACTS FOR- YOU KNOW SPECIALIZED- SERVICES BECOME AND LIKE FIRE ALARM FIRE SUPPRESSION SERVICING THINGS LIKE THAT. SO THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THE DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WERE MONITORING- AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO THE PRISONS OUT THERE- WE ALSO DO- ASK FOR WHAT WE CALL A CALL LETTER PROCESS WHERE- ONCE A YEAR WOULD YOU ASK THEM TO- UPDATE US ON ANY MAINTENANCE NEEDS A LARGE SCALE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MEANS THAT- WE DID NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOW ABOUT. OR THAT THE PERSON HAD NOT TOLD US ABOUT SO THAT WE MAKE SURE WE'RE PRIORITIZING THEM- WITH- WITH THE- PROPER ASSISTANCE- BUT ONE OTHER ASPECT ON STARTED TO CONTINUE- WITH THE ANSWER BUT I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE DO WORK. WITH THE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR SO SUCH AS MR DAVIS- WE WORK WITH THE HEADQUARTERS MISSIONS AND WE SHARE INFORMATION WITH THEM ABOUT HOW THE MAINTENANCE FUNDING IS BEING SPENT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AND SO WE SEE THAT- PRISON AS A HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR EIGHT MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND THE MAINTENANCE FUNDING HASN'T BEEN SPENT WE'RE GOING TO ALERT- THE- THE- DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. MAKE SURE THAT THEIR- AWARE OF THAT THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE WORKING DOWN THERE CHANGE TO OUR HELP THERE ARE WARDENS AND THEIR- PLANT OPERATIONS. STAFF- PERFORM THEIR FUNCTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE- I'M MISTER B. AT YOU. WE ALSO SPOKE- TODAY AND TALK ABOUT- THE- HOMELESS PEOPLE ON PAROLE AND I KNOW THAT- THE- PROBOARDS HAS INDICATED THAT WHILE HELPFUL HAVE A HOUSING PLAN ISN'T NECESSARY- TO GRANT A RELEASE DATE- BUT I ALSO BELIEVE THAT- GRANTING FOLKS RELEASE AND HAVING FOLKS ON PAROLE WITHOUT HOUSING- IS A FAST TRACK- BACK TO INCARCERATION. OR RE INCARCERATION- AND I JUST CAN'T WRAP MY HEAD AROUND HOW WE'RE LETTING FOLKS OUT ASKING THEM TO RE ENTER SUCCESSFULLY INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WITHOUT HAVING ANY HOUSING- AND SO I AM SURE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE- GRAND MASTER OF ALL THINGS HOUSING FOR PAROLEES BUT- CAN YOU JUST HELP ME RECONCILE. WHAT DISCUSSIONS ARE WHAT PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS ARE BEING RELEASED WITH AS MUCH SUPPORT AS POSSIBLE IT IS INCOME CRITICAL THAT SOMEONE HAS A PLACE TO LAY THEIR HEAD JUST LIKE IT IS CRITICAL THAT SOMEONE HAS OPTIONS FOR EMPLOYMENT. JUST LIKE IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT SOMEBODY HAS- OPPORTUNITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS TO HELP THEM ONCE THEY'RE OUT. YOU CAN WITH ASSESSMENT OF CENTCOM WATER IN THAT- HAVING RESIDENTIAL STABILITY IS CRITICAL AND TO THAT END- THE STAFF FROM THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS- BE WITH OUR- APPROACH BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED TO START. MAKING A PLAN AND ESTABLISHING PLANS AS TO WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO RESIGN. NOW MOST OF THOSE RELEASED HAVING STABLE RESIDENCE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO BE RELEASED THAT IS TRUE MINOR STATUTES BUT THAT IS OF CONCERN TO EVERY AGENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEIR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE PRO LEVY AND LARGE PART HANDS ON THE STABILIZING FACTORS. AS IN SPAIN ONE. I WILL SAY THAT THAT IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR ME- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN WHICH YOU PARTICIPATE TRYING TO SEE HOUSING- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE YOU KNOW WE WILL WE WILL MEET ANYONE UNDER OUR SUPERVISION WHEREVER THEY ARE WHETHER THEY HAVE RESIDENTIAL STABILITY OR NOT. THAT THAT ISN'T. AFFECT WHAT ADDITIONAL SERVICES WE OFFER THEM A STRONG IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE REPLICATION. WE ARE DEFINITELY IN CONCURRENCE THAT THAT THAT IS THAT IS A PILLAR FOR THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. RIGHT WELL WE HAVE OVER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF OUR FOLKS ON PAROLE WHO ARE UN HOUSED IN. MEETING THEM WHERE THEY ARE IS ONE THING MAKING SURE THEY DON'T COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM IS THE THING THAT I'M MOST. CONCERNED ABOUT SO MY HOPE IS THAT THERE'S A MORE LASER FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS HAVE THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. SO THAT WE'RE NOT SEEING THEM BACK BECAUSE AND THAT MEANS WE FAILED. I'M MISTER DAVIS I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU AND I'M- MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE RIGHT AND TO THE RIGHT OF ME ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT- INTAKE BEING CAUSED BECAUSE OF COVE IT- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO THINGS I KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FIRE CAMPS AT C. I. W. BUT SINCE- WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT IT I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I HAVE HEARD IN. A NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE- WOMEN AT C. I. W. ARM AND THESE ARE COME THIS IS COMING FROM FOLKS WHO ARE OUT- SO NOT JUST FROM FOLKS WHO ARE IN FACT. HAVE TALKED ABOUT- INSTANCES WHERE- BEING ACCEPTED OR RECOMMENDED INTO THE- PROGRAM THE- THE FIRE CAN'T PROGRAM WAS PREDICATED ON SEXUAL FAVORS- AND SO I'M JUST RAISING THAT BECAUSE I AM ACUTELY CONCERNED ABOUT ARE WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED- AND- YOU KNOW. THE THESE ARE IN. CHOICE PROGRAMS I RECOGNIZE IN THERE ONE THAT FOLKS REALLY WANT TO BE PART OF- AND SO- SEXUALIZING ARE ARE INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS- AND BAITING THEM WITH THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS I'M IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TOLERATE SO IT'S DID THAT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU BY FIRE CAMPS WAS IN YOUR LITTLE PACKET AND I FELT LIKE I HAD TO JUST SAY TO PUT IT ON THE RECORD- BUT- I DID ASK ABOUT. YOU KNOW ARMED COMPASS- AND THAT- AND HOW DURING THE RECEPTION CENTER PROCESSING IT IS USED TO HELP CREATE A REHABILITATION CASE PLAN AND ALSO- STUDIES HAVE COME OUT THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT- IT IS IT IT USES AN ALGORITHM THAT'S RACIALLY BIASED AND SO- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR YOU- TALK TO ME ABOUT COMPASS AND- STEPS TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS- TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT THE SOLE- DETERMINANT TOOL THAT WERE USING WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO- WHEN WE'RE HAVING FOLKS COME AND THE RECEPTION CENTRES IN WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH AND TAKEN OVER TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A REHABILITATION PLAN FOR THEM. BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW WE CAN PUT A PLAN OF SUCCESS TOGETHER FOR SOMEONE USING A TOOL- THAT- SET THEM BACK. THANK YOU SENATOR- I HAVE NOT HEARD THAT YEAH THAT. COMPLAINT AGAINST CONGRESS- UNTIL GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND DO A LITTLE RESEARCH MYSELF AND THEN READ READ SOME SOME ARTICLES WERE TALKED ABOUT CAMPUS- BEING USED FOR SENTENCING- AND THE RACIAL BIAS TOWARDS SENTENCING- I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR PROCESS- I BELIEVE THE SECRETARY MENTIONS THAT THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT- OTHER ASSESSMENT TOOLS- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT PROCESS IS RIGHT NOW- BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING AT OTHER THINGS- BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY. THE ONLY A STEP IS TAKEN TO TRY AND BUILD THAT PLAN FOR SUBSTANCE USE- THAT'S HANDLED THROUGH OUR HEALTH CARE DEPARTMENT- AND BETWEEN A COMBINATION OF NURSING AND SOCIAL WORKERS THEIR INTERVIEWS DONE TO ASSESS- TO. THEIR SENSE USE NAY SO THAT'S PART OF THAT PLAN- THERE ARE INTERVIEWS DIRECTLY WITH THE CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR- TO DISCUSS- TO DISCUSS THEIR PAST DISCUSS THEIR HISTORY DISCUSS THEIR INTERESTS. AND TO KIND OF DETERMINE THEIR NEEDS WHETHER BE EDUCATIONAL- CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION- YOU KNOW THOSE TYPE THINGS- SO IT'S NOT THE ONLY THING THAT SHOES BUT LIKE I LIKE I SAID- AND LIKE THE SECRETARY MENTIONED I BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING AT OTHER. AND ANOTHER TOOL FOR THAT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS RIGHT NOW BUT- WELL HOPEFULLY THAT'S FAST TRACKED. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT- I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO A NUMBER OF FOLKS TELL ME THAT SOMETIMES THEY TELL THE JUDGE JUST SEND ME TO PRISON. BECAUSE THE PROGRAMMING AND OUR STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. IS MUCH BETTER THAN WHAT WE GET- AT OUR COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES. AND SO- I KNOW A LOT OF THAT HAPPENS- AT OUR RECEPTION CENTERS. AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT CAN CONTINUE. AND I HOPE THAT AS YOU ARE- WELL YOU KNOW ONCE YOU ARE CONFIRMING YOUR CONTINUING TO DO YOUR WORK THAT YOU ALSO REMEMBER THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD ABOUT. DOING ASSESSMENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS ARE- SAFE BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT THE PRISON RAPE THAT HAPPENS AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE HONORABLE POPULATIONS AND MAKING SURE THAT WHEN THEY START- AT YOUR CENTER- THAT THAT KIND OF CONSIDERATION- FOR THEIR SAFETY. ARM FOR THEIR SEXUAL SAFETY- IS REALLY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU.
