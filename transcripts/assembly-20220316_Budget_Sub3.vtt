CALIFORNIA AND THE GOVERNOR'S-

00:50:49.246 --> 00:50:50.680
DESIRE TO REPLACE INTERNAL

COMBUSTION ENGINES WITH ZAPS AND

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.850
I. I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT MOVE

00:50:53.917 --> 00:50:55.786
THIS IS THE MOMENT WE SEE WHAT'S

00:50:55.852 --> 00:50:57.521
HAPPENING WITH GAS PRICES WERE.

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:58.655
EXPERIENCING WITH THE REST OF

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:00.690
THE WORLD AS HAD TO DEALWITH

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:02.192
FOR A LONG TIME WHICH IS VERY

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.727
HIGH GAS PRICES AND VOLATILITY

00:51:03.794 --> 00:51:04.795
THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE- IT'S

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:07.097
YOU KNOW BEEN. GIVING PEOPLE THE

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:09.199
RELIEF OF MOVING INTO A VEHICLE

00:51:09.266 --> 00:51:12.769
THAT DOESN'T. RELY ON FOSSIL

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:14.538
FUELS IS A HUGE GIFT TO THE

00:51:14.604 --> 00:51:15.939
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND WILL

00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.641
YOU KNOW LONG RUN BE MUCH

HEALTHIER FOR COMMUNITIES FOR.

00:51:19.676 --> 00:51:21.011
FOR AIR QUALITY FOR EVERYTHING

00:51:21.077 --> 00:51:22.846
ELSE SO THIS IS THIS IS THE

00:51:22.913 --> 00:51:23.914
MOMENT AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:26.650
WE ARE SEIZING IT. I DO WONDER

00:51:26.716 --> 00:51:28.819
ABOUT THE- DECISIONS THAT WE

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:31.087
MAKE IN TERMS OF WHICH THEY HAVE

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:33.490
INFRASTRUCTURE TO FIND I AM

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:36.460
CONCERNED THAT WE MAKE A LOT OF

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:37.461
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHERE TO PUT

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.395
CHARGING STATIONS FOR INSTANCE

00:51:38.462 --> 00:51:39.963
AND HOW PEOPLE ARE GOING TO USE

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.232
THEM- DO THEY PREFER TO HAVE IT

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.568
IN THERE YOU KNOW IN THEIR

00:51:44.634 --> 00:51:46.903
APARTMENT BUILDING OR OR AT

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:48.772
WORK. OR AT TARGET. I RETAIL

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:49.840
NEUTRAL AT. LARGE STORE. THAT

00:51:49.906 --> 00:51:53.243
THEY GO TO A LOT- DO THEY YOU

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:55.245
KNOW IT IF WE PUT IT IN AN

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:55.912
APARTMENT BUILDING WHAT HAPPENS

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:57.948
THEN TO. YOU KNOW IS THE

00:51:58.014 --> 00:51:59.649
BUILDINGS CAN IT CAN THEIR

00:51:59.716 --> 00:52:00.550
INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTED. DO

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.085
THEY TURN AROUND AND CHARGE THAT

00:52:02.152 --> 00:52:04.554
RESIDENT A LOT OF MONEY TO USE

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:05.989
IT- DOES A BIG DO WE CREATE

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:08.225
STRANDED ASSETS- YOU KNOW HOW

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:09.759
MUCH OF THE SHOULD BE PUBLIC HOW

00:52:09.826 --> 00:52:11.828
MUCH SHOULD BE PRIVATE- ALL OF

00:52:11.895 --> 00:52:13.864
THOSE SORTS OF QUESTIONS SO MY

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:15.232
QUESTION IS. YOU'RE CERTAINLY WE

00:52:15.298 --> 00:52:16.867
CAN'T ANSWER ALL OF THOSE BUT WE

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.668
CAN THINK A LOT ABOUT THEM AND

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:19.836
HAVE A STRATEGY SO MY QUESTION

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:22.005
IS. WHAT HOW O WE DEVELOP THIS

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:23.907
ROAD MAP WHO'S SORT OF IN CHARGE

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:25.575
OF MAKING THE DECISIONS. DO WE

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:26.810
HAVE A ROBUST GROUP OF

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.378
STAKEHOLDERS THAT INCLUDES THE

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:30.013
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT

00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.315
WE'RE TRYING TO. MOVE THESE

00:52:32.382 --> 00:52:34.084
CHARGERS INTO MORE AGGRESSIVELY

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:35.252
ARE WE LISTENING TO THEM

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.953
DIRECTLY ABOUT THEIR NEEDS OR

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.655
ARE WE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT

00:52:38.722 --> 00:52:40.190
WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST

00:52:40.257 --> 00:52:41.057
CONVENIENT TO THEM. OR WHAT

00:52:41.124 --> 00:52:44.094
WOULD SPUR. THEIR SWITCHED TO US

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:46.162
HAVE SO- THAT'S MY FIRST

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.664
QUESTION IS HOW ARE THESE HOW

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:50.600
ARE THE CITING. AND THE FUNDING

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:51.735
DECISIONS BEING MADE AT THE

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:53.803
STATE LEVEL. AND AT THE END AND

00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:55.272
DO WE FEEL THAT A CONFIDENT

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:57.007
ENOUGH THAT IT'S A ROBUST ENOUGH

00:52:57.073 --> 00:52:58.642
GROUP OF. PEOPLE AND DO WE HAVE

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:01.044
METRICS SO THAT WE CAN COURSE

00:53:01.111 --> 00:53:01.678
CORRECT QUICKLY IF WE DECIDE

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:04.347
THAT WE ARE. PUTTING A LOT OF

00:53:04.414 --> 00:53:06.449
MONEY INTO INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:07.751
NOT IT BEING UNDER UTILIZED.

00:53:07.817 --> 00:53:09.152
THAT THAT'S NOT A GREAT

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:12.088
QUESTION- PART OF OUR ANALYSIS

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:13.723
THAT THAT GOES INTO THAT IF IT

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:15.158
FROM THE TOOL OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.794
GIVEN OUT THOUGH. AB TWENTY ONE

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.796
TWENTY SEVEN HAS BEEN A REALLY

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.531
POWERFUL TOOL FOR US. AND ALSO

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:23.099
SENATE BILL ONE THOUSAND AND HOW

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:23.833
WE SITE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.802
ALWAYS WANT TO FIND A BALANCE

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:26.736
WE'RE NOT BEING OVERLY

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.871
PRESCRIPTIVE BUT ALSO GIVEN SOME

00:53:27.938 --> 00:53:30.240
DIRECTION. BOND SO WHETHER KELLY

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:32.208
B. I. P. PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE.

00:53:32.275 --> 00:53:34.844
WE USE MODELING TO TARGET WITH A

00:53:34.911 --> 00:53:35.779
LARGER CAPS ARE. FROM WHERE WE

00:53:35.845 --> 00:53:38.214
SEE VEHICLE- PROLIFERATING AND

00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:40.150
THAT ALSO WERE EXPECTED TO COME.

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:41.651
IN WITH A LOWER LEVEL OF

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.386
INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE TARGET

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.789
GAPS IN THAT WAY- YEAH ONE THING

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.691
I'VE LEARNED IS THAT NO ONE HAS

00:53:47.757 --> 00:53:50.160
ALL THE ANSWERS TO THOSE. AND WE

00:53:50.226 --> 00:53:51.161
NEED TO EMPOWER THE PRIVATE

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:51.995
MARKET. ATTENTION WE WANT TO

00:53:52.062 --> 00:53:53.897
MAKE A HAND UP TO THE PRIVATE

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.565
MARKET. WE ALSO WANT TO SET.

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:56.900
TARGETS SO FOR OUR FUNDING WE

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:58.635
HAVE A 50% MINIMUM FOR A LARGE

00:53:58.702 --> 00:53:59.736
NUMBER NOT THAT THE MUST GOT

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:02.806
DOCTOR LOW INCOME. SUBSIDY 50%

00:54:02.872 --> 00:54:04.074
ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:10.113
SIDE. HERE BUT FOR THE. PLANNING

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.381
PROCESS GOES. WE'LL OF WORKSHOPS

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.149
. WE TAKE A LOT OF INPUT- I

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:15.051
THINK AS WE MOVE. TO FULLY HAN

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.720
PERCENT VERY MUCH. WE ARE THAT

00:54:16.786 --> 00:54:18.355
RISK OF STRANDED ON. DOES AT

00:54:18.421 --> 00:54:19.789
MINIMUM BECAUSE WE KNOW EVERY-

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:22.459
WHO. OR OPERATES CAR. IS GOING%

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:25.261
TO NEED. A PLACE TO CHARGE. WITH

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:27.030
AT HOME CHARGING THE THING THAT

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:28.632
I REALLY LIKE ABOUT IT IN OUR

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.433
SYSTEM AND DATA SHOWED THAT. IS

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.602
THAT- IF IT'S CHEAPER FUEL COSTS

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:34.404
FOR MOST PEOPLE. THE RESIDENTIAL

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:35.739
TERRAPIN RATES ARE CHEAPER THAN

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:37.507
THE- COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL HAVE

00:54:37.574 --> 00:54:39.175
DEMAND CHARGES. SO WE REALLY

00:54:39.242 --> 00:54:40.877
WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE. IT

00:54:40.944 --> 00:54:42.779
CHEAPER FOR FOLKS TO DO IT

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.914
INCLUDING THOSE M. U. D. RENTERS

00:54:44.981 --> 00:54:46.850
- BOTH HOMES AND APARTMENTS. WE

00:54:46.916 --> 00:54:48.451
ALSO IT'S MORE CONVENIENT IT IS

00:54:48.518 --> 00:54:50.053
LIKE A CELL PHONE ON THAT PHONE

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.622
WHEN YOU PLUG IT IN AT NIGHT.

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.690
YOU HAVE IT ALL DAY TOP RATE AND

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:56.326
I WORRIED ABOUT FINDING A PLACE

00:54:56.393 --> 00:55:00.597
TO FUEL. IS ALSO WHAT MARGARET

00:55:00.664 --> 00:55:02.432
FRIENDLY. WE TO DEPLOY LOW TWO

00:55:02.499 --> 00:55:03.900
CHARGE. FOR THE STUDY INSTEAD OF

00:55:03.967 --> 00:55:05.001
TO RELY HEAVILY ON. FIVE

00:55:05.068 --> 00:55:07.003
STARTERS. WE KNOW WE NEED BOTH

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.838
OF THOSE- BUT REALLY WANTED. AT

00:55:08.905 --> 00:55:10.106
HOME TARGET ONE MORE WHERE THAT

00:55:10.173 --> 00:55:12.075
MAKE SENSE. AND WE HAVE A-

00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:16.212
WELDER PASTA. PART OF IT IS

00:55:16.279 --> 00:55:18.782
DESIGNED. WHICH ALLOW PARTIES.

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.983
TO IMPLEMENT ON OUR BEHALF

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.317
BECAUSE WE WE'RE NOT ALL THE

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.119
AND- SEVEN SEVEN. THAT MAY BE.

00:55:23.186 --> 00:55:25.355
TO DATE ORDER. I THE VA. FOR

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:26.756
OTHER PARTY HELP THE PLAN THAT

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:30.527
FUNDING. THANK YOU I'M- I'M ALSO

ANY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES ARE

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:41.237
LOOKING AT REMOVING SOME OF THE

00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:43.206
BARRIERS TO COMMERCIAL CHARGING

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:45.475
AND SO I HEAR A LOT FROM VARIOUS

00:55:45.542 --> 00:55:46.576
CHARGING COMPANIES THAT ARE

00:55:46.643 --> 00:55:48.478
LOOKING TO INSTALL CHARGING

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:51.014
STATIONS AND THEY BRING UP A LOT

00:55:51.081 --> 00:55:53.850
OF BARRIERS THAT WOULD THAT ARE

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:56.252
PREVENTING THEM FROM- FROM DOING

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:57.721
INFRASTRUCTURE WORK THAT WE WANT

00:55:57.787 --> 00:55:59.823
YOU KNOW FROM THE FROMTHE

WITH THE- NEED TO UPGRADE-

00:56:07.297 --> 00:56:09.065
SUBSTATIONS A LOT OF TIMES I ONE

00:56:09.132 --> 00:56:10.734
OF THEM TALKED ABOUT HOW THEY

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.869
NEED TO A SUBSTATION UPGRADE FOR

00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:13.503
A LARGE CHARGING STATION THEY

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.805
WANTED TO FIND ON THEIR OWN TIME

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:16.372
MAYBE EVEN USING SOME STATE

00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:19.375
INCENTIVES- BUT- THE UTILITY

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:20.710
THAT THEY WERE DEALING WITH.

00:56:20.777 --> 00:56:21.878
SAID THAT THEIR TIME LINE TO

00:56:21.945 --> 00:56:23.313
GIVE THE APPROVALS WAS TWO

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:25.348
YEARS. SO THEY'VE BEEN WAITING

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:26.916
NOW FOR OVER A YEAR THEY SAID

00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:30.153
THERE'S NO. YOU KNOW. NO IDEA

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.254
WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:33.022
HAVE THE SUBSTATION OPERATED.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:35.525
AND SO FORTH YOU KNOW THAT'S A

00:56:35.592 --> 00:56:36.826
HUGE BARRIER- TO EVEN TO ROLLING

00:56:36.893 --> 00:56:38.962
OUT THE FUNDING THAT WE WANT-

00:56:39.028 --> 00:56:41.598
ANOTHER ONE TALKED ABOUT HOW-

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:43.600
EVEN THOUGH DURING THE DAY. THE

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.702
PRICE FOR THE POWER IS NOMINAL

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.103
WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW A TON OF

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:48.671
RENEWABLES ON THE GRID AND YET

00:56:48.738 --> 00:56:50.039
THEY'RE BEING CHARGED PEAK

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.674
PRICES. IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.309
ARE FOR THE POWER THAT THEY USE.

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:54.911
AND SO THEY HAVE TO PASS THAT

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.713
ALONG TO THEIR THEIR USERS. SO

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.381
I'M WONDERING WHETHER WE'RE IN

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.483
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALL OF

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.285
THE VARIOUS UTILITIES WHO ARE IN

00:57:02.352 --> 00:57:03.686
SOME WAYS THE GATEKEEPERS THE

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.421
ELECTRICITY THAT WE'RE USING FOR

00:57:05.488 --> 00:57:07.690
THESE VEHICLES. TO MAKE SURE

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.359
THAT THEIR POLICIES ARE ALIGNING

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:11.561
WITH OUR GOALS YOU KNOW AND ALSO

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:14.164
THROW INTO THAT. THE POSSIBILITY

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:17.133
OF ALL THESE EV'S BEING USED AS

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.035
GRID RESILIENCY YOU KNOW. WITH

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.770
THE POSSIBILITY WITH TECHNOLOGY

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.572
ALLOWING THEM TO FEED ENERGY

00:57:22.639 --> 00:57:24.274
BACK INTO THOSE PRIVATE

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.208
RESIDENCES WHEN POWER'S BEEN TO

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.677
BEEN- TURNED OFF BECAUSE OF

00:57:27.744 --> 00:57:29.779
WILDFIRE OR OTHER OR HIGH WIND

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.948
EVENTS. AT THE END THE

00:57:32.015 --> 00:57:33.716
RELUCTANCE AND SEEMS OF THE

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:35.518
UTILITIES TO OVER TO HELP.

00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:38.021
PEOPLE TO INSTALL BATTERY

00:57:38.087 --> 00:57:39.989
STORAGE TO DO EXACTLY THAT SO

00:57:40.056 --> 00:57:41.958
WHAT WHERE IS THE UTILITY TIÞN

00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:44.327
AND HOW RECEPTIVE HAVE YOU BEEN

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:46.262
TO HELPING TO BE IN DISCUSSIONS

00:57:46.329 --> 00:57:47.764
TO REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO.

00:57:47.831 --> 00:57:49.599
FURTHER YOU KNOW FURTHER

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.534
DEPLOYMENT OF ALL OF THIS

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:52.735
INFRASTRUCTURE. I KNOW THAT WAS

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:53.970
A BIG QUESTION WITH A LOT OF

00:57:54.037 --> 00:57:56.172
EXAMPLES BUT THIS IS THE KIND OF

00:57:56.239 --> 00:57:57.941
THING I HEAR ALL THE TIME. FROM

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:59.008
COMPANIES THAT ARE TRYING TO DO

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:00.877
CHARGING IN SAYING WE HAVE THE

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:02.645
MONEY WE HAVE THE CAPITAL WE

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.247
CAN'T. BUILD THESE RIGHT NOW

00:58:04.314 --> 00:58:06.349
THERE'S JUST TOO MANY BARRIERS.

00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:07.183
TIMELINE'S PERMITTING COST OF

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:09.986
USE NOT HAVING- DEMAND PRICING

00:58:10.053 --> 00:58:19.729
ALL OF THAT. I BELIEVE THAT-

00:58:19.796 --> 00:58:21.598
DIRECTOR CAR BUT- I KNOW THE

00:58:21.664 --> 00:58:24.901
ENERGY COMMISSION- HOW LONG THIS

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:25.969
CONVERSATION THE CORRECT I DO

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:28.504
WANT TO TAKE THE PLUNGE. I THINK

00:58:28.571 --> 00:58:29.606
THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE I CAN

00:58:29.672 --> 00:58:31.007
JUMP IN WITH ANYTHING ELSE. OKAY

00:58:31.074 --> 00:58:32.675
GREAT- AND I CAN SPEAK A LITTLE

00:58:32.742 --> 00:58:34.143
BIT PLEASE TELL THE FACT TO

00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.912
OFFEND A LEVIN YEARS- AT A

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:36.980
CALIFORNIA TELL THE BEFORE

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:39.148
JOINING STATE SERVICE. AND YOU

00:58:39.215 --> 00:58:40.216
KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK THERE

00:58:40.283 --> 00:58:41.718
IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT MAKING

00:58:41.784 --> 00:58:44.587
SURE THAT THE UTILITIES ARE ABLE

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.288
TO DEPLOY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.423
AHEAD OF IT- I WORRY MORE

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:49.292
FRANKLY ON THE MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY

00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:51.361
DUTY SIDE. BUT ALSO WHEN YOU

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:53.463
HAVE A LARGE BANK VIDAK HERDERS.

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:55.265
SOME OF THAT PLANNING HAPPENS

00:58:55.331 --> 00:58:57.433
NATURALLY YOU KNOW BE IT FOR

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:58.334
ANYTHING. NO NEED CITY

00:58:58.401 --> 00:58:59.502
DEVELOPMENTS THE APARTMENT THE

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:01.704
CONDO REALLY ANYTHING. BUT WE

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:04.073
FIGURED POCKETS WE NEED TO GET

00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:08.444
HAD ABOUT. WANTING. TO-

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:09.312
DEPRESSION AND DOING. HAVE WE

00:59:09.379 --> 00:59:11.748
STARTED AGE. A THANK. PRETTY

00:59:11.814 --> 00:59:13.116
EARLY DAYS THE IT AND WE'RE

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:14.651
WAITING A POLICY REALLY TRY TO

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.786
FRAME IT AND SEE HOW IT FITS.

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:18.521
WITH OTHER RAPPERS. WE WANTED A

00:59:18.588 --> 00:59:19.188
LITTLE OF AN EARLY WARNING

00:59:19.255 --> 00:59:20.790
SYSTEM. SO WE KNOW WE'RE THE

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.025
VEHICLES ARE COMING WHERE THE

00:59:22.091 --> 00:59:22.959
CHARGING STATIONS ARE COMING.

00:59:23.026 --> 00:59:24.661
AND HOW WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH

00:59:24.727 --> 00:59:26.596
OUR HYPER DEMAND FORECASTS. AND

00:59:26.663 --> 00:59:29.432
OTHER- IF YOU SEE HOW TO FOR

00:59:29.499 --> 00:59:31.467
CAPITAL PROJECT- AND HOW CAN WE

00:59:31.534 --> 00:59:32.435
REALLY LOOK AT THE DISTRIBUTION

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:34.137
SYSTEM. YOU CAN BY AND LARGE A

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:35.171
LOT OF THE CONCERNED WE'RE

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.806
HEARING COULD NOT SO MUCH THE

00:59:36.873 --> 00:59:38.374
STATEWIDE SYSTEM. IT REALLY THAT

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.843
DIFFERENT DISTRIBUTION CIRCUIT.

00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.811
WHICH MIGHT BE NEARING CAPACITY

00:59:41.878 --> 00:59:44.047
LIMITS. ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT

00:59:44.113 --> 00:59:44.914
THEM DOWN. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

00:59:44.981 --> 00:59:46.416
RIGHT YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE THE

00:59:46.482 --> 00:59:48.051
INTERCONNECTION AND PLUMMETING.

00:59:48.117 --> 00:59:49.953
OUR TWO THINGS THAT CAUSE DELAYS

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.854
AND COSTS BOB BECAUSE- ANOTHER

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.723
SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING TO GET-

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.958
OUR ARMS WRAPPED AROUND A LITTLE

00:59:55.024 --> 00:59:57.527
BIT BETTER- BUT IT TOOK A LOT OF

00:59:57.593 --> 00:59:58.161
MONEY THAT ALREADY OCCURRED BUT

00:59:58.227 --> 00:59:59.729
I THINK WE GET SHARPER. SHARPEN

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:01.431
OUR PENCILS. ON THOSE SPECIFIC

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:04.200
DISTRIBUTION OR PETER AND TAX-

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:13.776
BUT EVERY CONDUCTOR IN THE WIND. OR SUBSTATION- PIECES. I KNOW

01:00:13.843 --> 01:00:15.812
. ON THE RATE. ALL THREE OF THE

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:17.313
LARGE I USE HAS IT. THAT I

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.582
BELIEVE THE P. HAVE THE PER. THE

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:21.985
NEW- RATED NINETY. ONE OF THEM.

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:24.287
THAT I MITIGATE REDUCING DEMAND

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:24.988
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME. BUT THE

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.023
DEMAND FOR OF COME BACK AND

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:29.125
OVERTIME. AND THEN ON THE LAST

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:31.060
COMPONENT- ABOUT BI DIRECTIONAL.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:31.928
THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE WE'RE

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:34.030
LOOKING TO TACKLE WE THIS IS I

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:35.765
HEARD THAT ONE OF THE TELL THE

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.368
I'VE HEARD IT ON THE SIDE OF IT

01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.136
AS WELL. IS THAT THERE ARE

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.004
UTILITIES ARE HESITANT TO

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:41.604
CONNECT. SOME BI DIRECTIONAL

01:00:41.671 --> 01:00:44.140
CHARGER AND LEFT IT ON THE

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.174
EQUIVALENT. OF THE SOLAR

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.676
INVERTER LIST. AND THAT WAS

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:48.978
SOMETHING CREATED FOR SOLAR-

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:50.847
SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO MAKE SURE

01:00:50.913 --> 01:00:51.914
WE GOT. OLDER INTERCONNECTS

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:53.883
OKAY. SO I WOULDN'T FEEL THE

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.351
TRANSPORTATION WERE LOOKING TO

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.753
CREATE A COROLLARY TO THAT

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.388
PROVIDE DIRECTIONAL PARKER. WHAT

01:00:58.454 --> 01:01:00.123
SPECIFICALLY THE INVERTER ON A

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:02.425
CHARGER SO WE CAN DO BI

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:03.359
DIRECTIONAL FUNCTIONALITY- I

01:01:03.426 --> 01:01:04.227
BELIEVE TEACHING YOU HAVE BEEN

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:05.928
PRETTY PROGRESS MILITARIA. DAY

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:06.896
IN FLORIDA JUST HAD AN

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.297
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THEY'RE GONNA

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:11.134
GAPS- FORD F. ONE FIFTY-

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.969
LIGHTNING. OUT THERE TO HELP

01:01:13.036 --> 01:01:15.138
MITIGATE THE PF YET THE BAND.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:15.838
BECAUSE THE GREAT THING ABOUT

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:16.939
ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT I THINK

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.975
YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE OF THE

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.676
QUESTION ABOUT. IT THAT THE IT

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.511
COULD PROVIDE ONSITE RESILIENCY

01:01:21.577 --> 01:01:23.413
IN A WAY THAT A GAS VEHICLE

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.014
NEVER CRIED. YEAH A FORD F. ONE

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.983
FIFTY. SIX SEVEN YEAR EIGHTY

01:01:27.050 --> 01:01:28.317
KILOWATT HOUR CAPACITY BATTERY.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.252
COULD PROVIDE ENERGY FOR THREE

01:01:29.318 --> 01:01:32.155
DAYS. AND OTHER EVENTS SO THAT

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:33.222
REAL THE TOPIC TODAY IS NOT THE

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:35.024
FUTURE OF THE BANK. BUT THEY'RE

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:43.232
STILL BARRIERS. WE WANT TO

01:01:43.299 --> 01:01:44.667
TACKLE. AND ADDITION TO THAT BY

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.636
DIRECTIONAL WILL LOOK TO CREATE.

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.271
ONE OF OUR SISTER- IT'S FUNDING

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:49.439
COULD BE A CALL THE BILL. FOR

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:50.673
THE TASTE. I BELIEVE THAT SOME

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.141
OF CORPORATE OF THAT WE'RE

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:52.975
DOING- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING YOU

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.610
CAN THINK TO MAKE THAT. AND

01:01:54.677 --> 01:01:56.612
MORE. AND ALWAYS OF MORE I OF

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:57.780
HOW TACKLE BARRIERS. I THINK

01:01:57.847 --> 01:01:59.348
THAT REALLY COVERS FIELD FOR.

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.050
GIVEN HOW. ON EDUCATION IT'S ON

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:02.785
ALL OF THESE FRIENDS THANK YOU

MEMBERS THAT WE WERE WORKING AND

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:07.723
WITH SUCH WITH FLEETS HEAVY DUTY

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.459
FLEETS WOULD YOU WORK WITH THEM

01:02:09.525 --> 01:02:10.793
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALSO

01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.694
WORKING ON INFRASTRUCTURE

01:02:11.761 --> 01:02:12.295
PLANNING AND CONNECTING WITH

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:14.363
FOLKS SAID WE HAVE A REALLY GOOD

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.997

FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS A

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.353
HEDGE ADD SOME COMMENTS HERE

LATER BUT I'M GONNA DO THIS NOW

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:41.224
THEY FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIR OF

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:42.325
TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES-

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:46.796
ACTUALLY QUESTIONS- AND- I WANT

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.564
TO ADD TO THOSE IN MY

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.666
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PORCH THE

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:53.736
PORCH- SOME OF THE PORT PEOPLE

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:55.671
I'VE TALKED TO DON'T HAVE A LOT

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:56.939
OF CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN THEY

01:02:57.006 --> 01:02:57.807
ELECTRIFY THE WHOLE PORT THAT

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.475
THERE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH-

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:02.979
DELIVERY OF POWER- FROM. FROM

01:03:03.045 --> 01:03:05.581
THE GRID- FOR WHAT THEY NEED-

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:08.651
AND- SO THINK OF ALL OF THE

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.653
POSSIBILITIES SAID- WE JUST

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.588
HEARD DARE YOU KNOW WHICH WAY

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.123
ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO FEED

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.225
POWER BACK IN THERE SO MANY

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.593
THERE'S SO MANY COMPLICATING

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.262
THINGS HERE I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.863
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE- THE

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.098
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:24.867
COMMISSION- INVOLVED IN MAKING

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:27.303
SURE THAT- WE HAVE A COORDINATED

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.640
PLAN- BUT THAT LEADS ME TO ONE

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:31.974
OF MY CONCERNS AND THAT IS WHEN

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.709
YOU HAVE DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:35.878
OF THE CPUC HERE. YEAH THIS

01:03:35.945 --> 01:03:37.146
ENERGY COMMISSION YOU HAVE THE

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.114
ADMINISTRATION WHEN YOU HAVE

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:40.783
DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S A

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:43.152
IT REALLY IS HARD TO HAVE THE

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:45.288
APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY TO

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.323
MAKE SURE WE HAVE A COORDINATED

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.927
PLAN GOING FORWARD- AND WE HAVE

01:03:50.993 --> 01:03:52.528
DIVIDED RESPONSIBILITY BY THE

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:54.063
NATURE OF THE LIVES OF THE WAY

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:56.566
WE'VE SET UP- DEMOCRACIES IN THE

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.334
COUNTRY AND CRITICALLY WHAT WHAT

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.937
WE HAVE HERE- IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:02.939
IT REMINDS ME OF THAT OF THE

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.740
CLASSIC- WHEN I WAS DOING MY

01:04:04.807 --> 01:04:07.310
STUDENT TEACHING AND S. AS IN A

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:08.911
STUDENT TEACHER ASKED TO SAID.

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:11.047
SO HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE

01:04:11.113 --> 01:04:12.748
PREPARED ENOUGH AND THE RESPONSE

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.450
WAS YOU YOU'RE NEVER YOU CAN

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.152
NEVER HAVE TO COMPLETE OF A PLAN

01:04:16.219 --> 01:04:17.920
AS MUCH TIME AS YOU HAVE AS MUCH

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.256
ENERGY AS YOU CAN PLAN AND KEEP

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.457
PLANNING THEIR IT THERE'S MORE

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:24.327
TO IT THAN AND I WOULD OFFER-

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:29.131
THAT WHEN WE. NEED A CONCERTED

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.366
EFFORT- OF EVERYBODY COMING

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:31.901
TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:34.237
PLAN AND THE PLAN WILL HAVE TO

01:04:34.303 --> 01:04:35.471
BE AN ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PLAN

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.407
AS THINGS CHANGE. BUT I AM

01:04:38.474 --> 01:04:40.476
CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE ALL

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.545
OF THE- ALL OF THE COORDINATION

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.480
THAT WE NEED TO GO FORWARD AS

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:45.615
ROOM AS FOR MAKING THESE BIG

01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:49.018
INVESTORS. SO WITH THAT- OVERALL

01:04:49.085 --> 01:04:50.987
I WANT TO COMPLIMENT- THE

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:52.788
ADMINISTRATION THE ENERGY

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:54.924
COMMISSION AND CARB- FOR THIS

01:04:54.991 --> 01:04:56.859
PRESENTATION I THINK THAT'S IT

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.962
THIS IS A VERY GOOD START. A

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.597
VERY GOOD COMPLEMENT TO THE

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:03.099
EFFORTS THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE

01:05:03.165 --> 01:05:04.400
ALREADY BEEN MADE- GOING

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:07.236
FORWARD- I HAVE MANY QUESTIONS

01:05:07.303 --> 01:05:09.372
HERE. BUT I DON'T NEED LONG

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.841
ANSWERS TO ALL OF THAT SO WHAT I

01:05:11.907 --> 01:05:12.675
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:13.776
USUALLY JUST SHORT

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:16.612
CLARIFICATIONS SO- AND- I WOULD

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:18.314
APPRECIATE IF WE CAN KEEP. OF

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:21.217
THE ANSWERS AS BRIEF SO THAT- I

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.318
CAN GET THROUGH THESE QUESTIONS

01:05:22.385 --> 01:05:25.321
AND- I'M GONNA BE ON- I'M ON

01:05:25.388 --> 01:05:33.062
PAGE. TEN OF THE- FOR A- OUR ON

01:05:33.129 --> 01:05:35.097
PAGE OF THE OF THE DOCUMENT-

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:39.602
THERE'S A REFERENCE TO- THE

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.570
THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT OR HIRE A

01:05:41.637 --> 01:05:43.739
DIRECT CURRENT FAST CHARGERS

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:47.643
AND- I'VE BEEN CALCULATING-

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:51.981
BASED ON THE- THE INFORMATION ON

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:52.782
ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE'RE TALKING

01:05:52.848 --> 01:05:54.350
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:05:54.417 --> 01:05:56.585
DOLLARS FOR FIVE THOUSAND DC

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:59.922
FAST CHARGERS- THAT WORKS OUT

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:01.057
TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:02.625
DOLLARS A CHARGE IS THAT WHAT-

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.894
THE ENERGY COMMISSION THINKS IS

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.463
THE- COST OF THE THREE HUNDRED

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:11.200
KILOWATT OR HIGHER- DC FAST

01:06:11.267 --> 01:06:15.071
CHARGERS. I BELIEVE OUR PORTION

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.406
WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE EIGHTY

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.375
TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND PER

01:06:19.442 --> 01:06:20.643
CHARGER WERE ALSO LOOKING TO

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.079
FIND- GREAT MEDICATION EFFORT

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:24.680
FOR THAT IT COULD BE- SOME OF

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:25.648
THAT DELTA FUNDING COULD GO

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.316
THROUGH TO THINGS LIKE CONSERVE

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.051
ENERGY STORED ALL THE AUTOMATED

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:31.287
LOAD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THERE ARE

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:32.755
OTHER THINGS TO BALANCE THE LOAD

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.657
FOR YOU TO HAVE A REALLY HIGH

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:35.624
GREAT IMPACT BUT THE PTSD PEAK

01:06:35.691 --> 01:06:38.027
WOULD BE ABOUT 829-200-1000

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:42.865
DOLLARS PER CHARGE. FOR THE.

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.233
THREE HUNDRED KILOWATT FAST

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:44.934
CHARGERS. SEKARANG AND WE EXPECT

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.435
THE PRIVATE. SIDE PICK UP THE

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.438
REST SO JUST TO. THE LEVEL TWO

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.006
CHARGERS HAVE BEEN A AND HAVE

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.376
BEEN GETTING A AN AVERAGE

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:55.511
INCENTIVE OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:59.081
SO HOW WOULD WE BE GOING TO

01:06:59.148 --> 01:07:00.149
THREE HUNDRED KILOWATTS WITHOUT

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:03.352
IT COSTING MORE. SO THE LEVEL

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:04.887
TWO CHARGERS IS ABOUT FOUR

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.422
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER CHARGER ON

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:08.290
THE PUBLIC SIDE ABOUT TWELVE

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:09.125
THOUSAND TOTAL WHEN YOU FACTOR

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:12.128
IN THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT THERE-

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.230
RIGHT NOW ARE FIFTY TO SEVENTY

01:07:14.296 --> 01:07:16.232
FIVE K. W. CHARTERED WHAT

01:07:16.298 --> 01:07:17.800
PUTTING IN ABOUT. FIFTY TO

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.635
SEVENTY THOUSAND HER PARTNER FOR

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:22.738
ABOUT ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- MY

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:25.274
NEXT QUESTION IS- THE THREE

01:07:25.341 --> 01:07:25.875
HUNDRED NINETY MILLION IN THE

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:27.676
MIDDLE OF THE PAGE GENERAL FUND

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:28.644
TO DEPLOY INFRASTRUCTURE TO

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.746
SUPPORT ONE THOUSAND- DRY AGE

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.448
TRUCKS AND SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:35.584
TRANSIT BUSES. IN SOME PLACES

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:37.753
THERE'S A REFERENCE TO THIS ALL

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.789
B. THESE ALL BEING ELECTRIC ARE

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:42.391
THESE TRANSIT BUSES GOING TO ALL

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.994
BE ELECTRIC. OR IS IT GOING TO

01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:47.763
BE- TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL IN TERMS

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:51.233
OF THE SIZE OF TRANSIT BUSES.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:52.435
OUR INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY

01:07:52.501 --> 01:07:53.903
TECH NEUTRAL SO WE TALK ABOUT

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:56.439
THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES YOU

01:07:56.505 --> 01:07:58.274
MEAN BATTERY AND FUEL CELL.

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.376
THURMOND INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:02.678
PERPETRATED FROM THE- I COULDN'T

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.380
UNDERSTAND THIS TWO ANSWERS JUST

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:06.415
IN TERMS OF CLARITY COULD CALL

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:08.584
SAY THAT AGAIN SO WHEN SOMETIMES

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:09.785
PEOPLE USE ELECTRIC AS A

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.454
SHORTHAND FOR BATTERY. BUT

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.589
THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION HERE SO

01:08:13.656 --> 01:08:15.257
THIS IS FOR ZERO EMISSION

01:08:15.324 --> 01:08:16.692
VEHICLES WHICH COULD BE BATTERY

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.861
VEHICLES OR FUEL CELL VEHICLES

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.796
BOTH HER ELECTRIC IN THE FOURTH

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:21.697
FOR THE BUSES AND FOR THE

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.899
DRAYAGE TRUCKS YES THANK YOU

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:26.936
THANK YOU OKAY- AND THEN THE

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.237
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.572
GENERAL FUND FOR INFRASTRUCTURE

01:08:29.638 --> 01:08:31.140
FURS HAVE TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.975
ROAD EQUIPMENT. COULD COULD

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.176
SOMEBODY JUST TO BRIEFLY

01:08:34.243 --> 01:08:36.612
ELABORATE HOW WILL THAT BE IF

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:37.746
WILL THAT BE ALLOCATED BASED ON

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:40.015
GRANT FUNDING- LIKE MANY OF THE

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:42.585
OTHER PROGRAMS. AND THIS IS THIS

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:45.654
IS FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S

01:08:45.721 --> 01:08:47.723
SEGMENT OF THE PRESENTATION SO.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:49.291
YES THAT'S CORRECT- COMPETITIVE

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:51.093
GRANT FUNDING THAT CAN GO UP TO

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.261
ELECTRIC AND HYBRID GREAT THANK

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.697
YOU AND THIS IS A UNDER THE CARB

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:57.199
AND C. E. C. SEGMENT THERE IS A

01:08:57.266 --> 01:08:59.335
STATEMENT THERE. JUST TWO

01:08:59.401 --> 01:09:00.569
HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS GENERAL

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:02.571
FUND FOR EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES-

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.507
AND THEN IT MAKES A REFERENCE AT

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.941
THE VERY END OF THAT- FIRST

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.943
PARAGRAPH SAYS. AS WELL AS

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:10.346
SUPPORT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.915
AT SCALE. COULD SOMEBODY CLARIFY

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.818
WHAT VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION AT

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:20.022
SCALE MEANS. BUT CERTAINLY- SO

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:20.923
THAT WOULD GO TO THE ENERGY

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:23.359
COMMISSION PORTION OF IT AND-

01:09:23.425 --> 01:09:23.959
WE'RE SEEING SOME REALLY GREAT

01:09:24.026 --> 01:09:25.861
IN THE VEHICLE GRID INTEGRATION.

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:27.830
THAT COULD BE ANYTHING FROM

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:29.698
REDUCING THE POWER OF THE

01:09:29.765 --> 01:09:31.600
TURKEY. AFTER THE MATCH NOT

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.035
ALWAYS AND I EXCUSE THEM AND ASK

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:34.803
YOU TO START OVER AGAIN I'M NOT

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:36.739
ABLE FALL THAT YOUR HAVE YOUR

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:38.007
MOUSE IS NOT MATCHED UP WITH

01:09:38.073 --> 01:09:42.478
YOUR SECOND IF YOU COULD. JUST

01:09:42.545 --> 01:09:43.679
SPEAK A LITTLE MORE SLOWLY I

01:09:43.746 --> 01:09:44.613
THINK THAT'LL HELP- I APOLOGIZE

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.383
ABOUT THAT- SO VEHICLE GRID

01:09:47.449 --> 01:09:49.919
INTEGRATION IS. INTEGRATING NEW

01:09:49.985 --> 01:09:51.754
VEHICLE LOAD WITH THE GRAND IN A

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.522
RESPONSIBLE MANNER. A LOT OF

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:54.790
TIMES PEOPLE THINK ABOUT BI

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.525
DIRECTIONAL FOR THAT. IT CAN

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.294
ALSO BE A SIMPLER THINGS LIKE

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.262
RATE DESIGN. FOR REDUCING THE

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:02.197
LOAD OF A CHARGING STATION. IN

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.199
RESPONSE TO A GREAT SIGNAL. SO

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.368
THAT INVESTMENT WILL GO TO

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:09.004
LARGER SEGMENT WTHIN BGI. ONE

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.773
SEGMENT WOULD BE TO HELP PUSH

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:13.976
OUT- SMART CHARGER BIDIRECTIONAL

01:10:14.043 --> 01:10:15.344
CHARGERS. AND METERING

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:17.580
EQUIPMENT. THE OTHER PORTION TO

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:21.050
GO TOWARD- HELPING STAND UP AND

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:22.751
THE POWER OF THE THIRD PARTY

TRANSPORTATION EXETER. THIS IS A

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.681
QUESTION OF FACT I THINK

01:11:58.747 --> 01:12:00.749
PROBABLY FOR A COMBINATION OF

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.352
CARBONI ENERGY COMMISSION- AND

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:04.787
ANYBODY ELSE IT MAY HAVE THAT

01:12:04.853 --> 01:12:07.056

01:12:08.824 --> 01:12:10.993
THAT MASS TRANSIT. EFFORT THERE

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.327
WITH THE TROLLEY IN THE MIDDLE

01:12:12.394 --> 01:12:14.897
OF THE- IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

I'M- BUT I'M VERY COMMITTED AS

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:23.639
MANY OF US ARE HERE TO TRYING TO

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:25.207
IMPROVE PASSED TRANSIT. I JUST

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:26.709
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE

01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:27.676
MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS WE

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:29.178
ACTUALLY YOU'RE MAKING AND THEN

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.779
AND THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO

01:12:30.846 --> 01:12:32.081
WORK- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:33.482
THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AND

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:35.284
IS THERE ANY ANALYSIS BEING DONE

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.553
AS TO. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:40.923
AND WHAT ARE THE LESSONS LEARNED

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:42.491
FOR US TO MAKE MASS TRANSIT-

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.759
OTHER OUR OTHER MASS TRANSIT

01:12:43.826 --> 01:12:45.761
INVESTMENTS OF THIS ARE THERE

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.696
AFFECTED. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.031
ABOUT THE TROLLEY SPECIFICALLY

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.632
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW ASKED ABOUT

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.700
THAT AND MATCHING CALTRANS

01:12:51.767 --> 01:12:53.802
ACOSTA MANAGEMENT SITES ON THE

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:55.671
GENERAL POINT WE DO TRACK REALLY

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:56.872
CLOSELY HOW THESE TRANSPORTATION

01:12:56.939 --> 01:12:58.640
VESTMENTS WORK IN PRACTICE SO

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:00.175
YOU KNOW HOW DOES THAT CHANGE

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:01.910

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.628
THE CHAIR HERE OF THE COMMITTEE

01:13:19.695 --> 01:13:21.597
I. I'VE SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:23.966
SUGGESTION THAT- AT LEAST TEN

MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TWO

01:13:25.834 --> 01:13:27.102
HUNDRED FIFTY SIX MILLION FOR

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.138
LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS- SHOULD BE

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:31.406
FOR TO FUND BATTERY REPLACEMENT-

01:13:31.473 --> 01:13:33.742
BECAUSE- I THINK THAT- MY

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.277
EXPERIENCES SOME LOW INCOME

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.745
PEOPLE ARE VERY ATTRACTED TO

01:13:36.812 --> 01:13:38.413
BUYING THESE CARS BECAUSE OF

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.783
THEIR LOW OPERATION- AND IT'S

01:13:40.849 --> 01:13:42.351
THE BATTERY THAT. IS THE ONE

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:46.288
THING IT BUT THEY CAN BY USED-

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:48.123

CAN REPLACE THAT BATTERY SO I

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:52.361
THINK THAT COULD BE A GREAT

01:13:52.427 --> 01:13:52.928

THINK THAT WOULD BE GREAT ADULT-

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:11.319
IF WE NEED TO WE SHOULD MOVE TO

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:12.821

YEAR'S BUDGET- AND OVER THE NEXT

01:18:44.586 --> 01:18:45.620
THREE YEARS. BUT MY

01:18:45.687 --> 01:18:47.389
UNDERSTANDING WAS THE INCOME

01:18:47.456 --> 01:18:49.891
GUIDELINES WERE CHANGED A COUPLE

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:51.760
WEEKS AGO COULD SOMEONE FROM-

01:18:51.827 --> 01:18:53.195
ERR THEIR BOARD JUST KIND OF

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:54.663
WALK US THROUGH WHAT THOSE

01:18:54.729 --> 01:18:56.298
CHANGES ARE WHAT THE THINKING

WAS. YES MISTER CHAIR SO THESE

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:59.701
ARE CHANGES THAT WERE VETTED IN

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.136
THE FUNDING PLAN PROCESS OVER

01:19:01.203 --> 01:19:03.472
THE LAST YEAR IN APPROVEDBY THE

01:19:03.538 --> 01:19:04.473
BOARD IN NOVEMBER. AND THEY'RE

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:06.041
KEY TO LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.310
WITHIN CEDAR PT GIVEN THE THREE

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:09.711
YEAR ALLOCATION TO IT. BUT THE

01:19:09.778 --> 01:19:11.646
BOARD APPROVED AND WHAT IS A

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:13.148
FACE DOWN BASED UPON CONTINUED

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:15.584
SUCCESS IN THE SALES SO AFTER

01:19:15.650 --> 01:19:17.385
THE MILLIONS HE WAS SOLD WHICH

01:19:17.452 --> 01:19:19.554
JUST HAPPENED- BEGINNING TO FACE

01:19:19.621 --> 01:19:22.491
DOWN BOTH- VEHICLE PRICES THE

01:19:22.557 --> 01:19:24.259
CAPS THREE OLD ONE PROGRAM. IN

01:19:24.326 --> 01:19:26.394
INCOME LEVELS AND SO IN ESSENCE

01:19:26.461 --> 01:19:28.830
THE PROGRAM GETS MORE FOCUSED ON

01:19:28.897 --> 01:19:30.332
SOMEWHAT LOWER PRICED VEHICLES

01:19:30.398 --> 01:19:31.867
AND SO MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON

01:19:31.933 --> 01:19:33.802
LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS. OVER

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:35.103
THE COURSE OF THE LIFE OF THE

01:19:35.170 --> 01:19:37.105
FUNDING AND THOSE TRIGGERS YEAH

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:38.840
BOARD APPROVED HAD BEGUN TO KICK

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:43.345
IN WITH. THE RESULT THAT MILLION

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:44.012
VEHICLE SALE. GOOD COULD YOU ARE

01:19:44.079 --> 01:19:46.047
US WERE THE INCOME IS AND NOW-

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:49.584
WHAT THE- VEHICLE PRESS STAR.

01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:50.986
SHARE SO THE PHASE ONE CHANGE-

01:19:51.052 --> 01:19:52.988
TOOK- FOR SINGLE FILERS WHAT I

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:54.756
BELIEVE IS A HUNDRED FIFTY K.

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.925
GROSS ANNUAL INCOME CAP TO ONE

01:19:56.992 --> 01:19:58.927
THIRTY FIVE K. THE FOR HEAD OF

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:01.563
HOUSEHOLD FOLKS IT WENT FROM I

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.332
BELIEVE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND TO

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:05.467
ONE SEVENTY FIVE. JOINT FILERS

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:06.668
THAT WENT TO I THINK TWO HUNDRED

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:07.702
THOUSAND FOR THREE HUNDRED

01:20:07.769 --> 01:20:08.870
THOUSAND. AND THIRTY CAP AND

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.672
WENT TO A BELIEVE FORTY FIVE

01:20:10.739 --> 01:20:11.373
THOUSAND. DOLLARS FOR SMALLER

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:13.108
VEHICLES THERE'S A FACE TO

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.809
CHANGE WHICH WON'T TAKE EFFECT

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:16.211
UNTIL FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY

01:20:16.278 --> 01:20:18.046
THREE THE BOARD LEFT TIME FOR

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:19.014
BOTH LEGISLATIVE FOR BOARD

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.382
REVISITING THIS. NICENESS IS

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.317
ALWAYS CHALLENGING. IS THAT THE

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:23.952
ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.987
EAGLE NOW THAT WOULD AND I

01:20:26.054 --> 01:20:29.824
BELIEVE. AND THEY'RE WITH ME ANY

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:30.759
FIGURES. BRING THEM CAPTAIN

01:20:30.825 --> 01:20:33.094
AHEAD TWENTY CAT ONE TWENTY K.

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:35.764
M. OR STANDARD FILERS FOR HAD

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:37.599
HOUSEHOLDS AND BELIEVE IT GOES

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:39.534
TO ONE SIXTY K. JOINT FOLLOWERS

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:41.937
ONE EIGHTY FIVE- AND AT THAT

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:43.805
POINT AGAIN HYBRIDS WILL COME

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:44.873
OUT. AND REBATE AMOUNTS TO GO

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:45.874
DOWN BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:20:45.941 --> 01:20:48.210
DOLLARS SO AGAIN THIS IS AN

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:49.010
EFFORT. TO THINK ABOUT I THINK

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:51.012
THAT'S WHERE THE BOARD WAS GOING

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:53.415
WITH THIS AND THROUGH THE PUBLIC

01:20:53.481 --> 01:20:54.049
PROCESS OBVIOUSLY CONSIDERED A

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.250
LOT OF FEEDBACK MANY DIFFERENT

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:57.018
FOLKS. TO TRY TO FOCUS A LIMITED

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:59.221
POOL OF FUNDS. ON SOMEWHAT LOWER

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.755
INCOME CALIFORNIANS TO THE

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:02.857
DEGREE THAT WE NEEDED TO MANAGE

01:21:02.924 --> 01:21:03.792
THAT AND THAT. IS IMPORTANT IN

01:21:03.858 --> 01:21:04.893
RELATION TO SOME BUDGET BILL

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:07.162
LANGUAGE THAT MAKE CLEAR THAT WE

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:08.463
SHOULD FOCUS I'M NOT GETTING

01:21:08.530 --> 01:21:08.997
REQUIREMENTS AND FOR LOWER

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.333
INCOME FOLKS. SO THAT'S WITH

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.168
THINKING COMES FROM- IT'S ALL

01:21:13.235 --> 01:21:14.302
LAID OUT IN SOME DETAIL THE

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:15.837
FUNDING PLAN. AND IT'S AN EFFORT

01:21:15.904 --> 01:21:17.973
AGAIN TO LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:18.807
WHILE MAKING THE PROGRAM

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:21.209
FOCUSING AT- AND EFFECTIVE LANCE

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:23.178
FOLKS WHO MAYBE HAVE SOMEWHAT

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.212
LESS MEANS AS SALES INCREASED.

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.014
GOT IT DID DID YOU- YOU

01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:27.482
MENTIONED YOU LOWER THE CAP ON

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:33.088
THE. VEHICLE SO AS WELL. YES

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:34.322
THAT'S RIGHT SO IT ENOUGH FIVE

01:21:34.389 --> 01:21:36.324
DOLLAR A BELIEVES THE CURRENT

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:36.925
AND A SURPLUS. FOR THE SOME OF

01:21:36.992 --> 01:21:38.760
THE SMALL VEHICLES. I THINK

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:39.728
ABSENT SIXTY K. FOR LARGER

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:40.829
VEHICLES THAT ARE WORKING ON

01:21:40.895 --> 01:21:42.764
THAT ONE. I SEE OKAY. AND SO DO

01:21:42.831 --> 01:21:45.133
WE DO WE EVEN KNOW HOW MANY.

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:51.072
VEHICLES ARE. THE QUITE A FEW I

01:21:51.139 --> 01:21:51.973
DON'T HAVE THE MODEL NUMBER FOR

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.775
ME IN MY HAD- BUT I'LL CHECK THE

01:21:53.842 --> 01:21:55.810
STAFF ON THE- OKAY. AND THEN DO

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:59.948
DO WE ARE. DO WE CONTINUE TO- A

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:02.717
SUPPORT PLUG IN HYBRIDS AS WELL

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:04.986
OR IS IT WE DO. HAVE A HYBRID TO

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:07.022
COME OUT AFTER ONE POINT TWO

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.089
FIVE MILLION IN THIS BORDER

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.024
VISITS THAT POINT THAT PRESENT

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:10.592
THEY REMAIN ELIGIBLE. IT WHAT'S

01:22:10.659 --> 01:22:13.628
WHAT'S THE LOGIC- FOR PLUG IN

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:14.963
HYBRIDS. WELL I THINK THE

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:17.132
THINKING HERE IS THAT AS WE MOVE

01:22:17.198 --> 01:22:18.400
INTO EVEN HIGHER SALES CLASSES

01:22:18.466 --> 01:22:19.968
PLUGINS BECOME LESS OF A LARGE

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.703
CHUNK OF THE OVERALL. SALES

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:22.737
FLEET SO WHEN WE LOOK FOR

01:22:22.804 --> 01:22:23.938
INSTANCE JUST PROJECTIONS WERE

01:22:24.005 --> 01:22:25.807
MANUFACTURERS ARE GOING. THAT

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:27.942
REMAINS. TO THE POINT IS FOR

01:22:28.009 --> 01:22:30.045
SOME FOLKS BUT HE NEEDS BECOME

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:31.980
MORE DOMINANT SO IF YOU GET A

01:22:32.047 --> 01:22:32.881
HIGHER SALES WE EXPECT TO BE

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.683
THERE BE MORE IN THE MODELS. I

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:35.784
WITHIN THAT PRICE CAPS SAID

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:37.118
THREE CHOOSING ON EMISSIONS.

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:40.055
MAKES MORE SENSE TO FOCUS ON.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:41.823
THESE YEAH BUT WHAT WHY EVEN

01:22:41.890 --> 01:22:44.125
HAVE A PLUG IN HYBRID ME SEEMS.

01:22:44.192 --> 01:22:46.494
WITH WITH. PASS GOT IT SORRY

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:48.496
CONTRACT. LITTLE DOES QUESTION

01:22:48.563 --> 01:22:50.398
WHY WHY EVEN PLUG IN DOES SEEM

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:53.635
TO BE- DOESN'T SEEM TO I DON'T

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.203
KNOW WHY WE HAVE ANY INCENTIVE

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.238
DOLLARS GOING TOWARD-

01:22:57.305 --> 01:22:59.040
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE GAS.

01:22:59.107 --> 01:23:01.643
OP ED- IS AN EARLY STAGE MEASURE

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.977
THIS LETTER MOVING AWAY FROM IT

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:04.212
THIS MADE SOME SENSE DEPENDING

01:23:04.279 --> 01:23:05.580
ON THE STATE OF THE OVERALL

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:06.781
CHARGING FRAMEWORK TO THINK FOR

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:07.949
INSTANCE ABOUT PERFECT WELLER'S

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.017
MIGHT HAVE LESS ACCESS TO IN

01:23:09.084 --> 01:23:10.118
HOME CHARGING THAT FLEXIBILITY

01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:12.454
CAN MATTER IN SOME USES ALL NOTE

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:14.322
THAT COVERS REGULATORY WORK SAID

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.990
THE BASKING CARE ACT YOU PACKAGE

01:23:16.057 --> 01:23:17.625
WE'RE MIGRATING STANDS YOUR PLUG

01:23:17.692 --> 01:23:18.660
IN HYBRIDS TO ESSENTIALLY MAKE

01:23:18.727 --> 01:23:20.495
THEM. MUCH MUCH CLOSER TO PURE

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:22.297
EV'S SAY YOU USE THE GAS ENGINE

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:23.798
PROBABLY REALLY SPECIALIST USES

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.101
A LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES SO

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:28.203
CERTIFIED ANSWER ONE. TWENTY TO

01:23:28.269 --> 01:23:29.871
MAKE THOSE CARS BETTER PERIOD

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:32.440
THE TWO THERE ARE SOME USERS

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:33.808
THINK APART WHETHER IT'S THINK

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:34.642
OF FOLKS RURAL COMMUNITIES AND

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.378
LIKE YOU MAY HAVE LESS ACCESS

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:37.746
YOU STILL GET THE BENEFITS IT

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:39.614
AND SO DO WE DID YOU INCREASE

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:42.050
THE MILE- REQUIREMENT FOR BUT

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:43.752
THE BATTERY SIZE BECAUSE YOU

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:44.886
HAVE SOME PLUG IN HYBRIDS WITH

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:46.688
PRETTY SMALL BATTERS. SO THAT

01:23:46.755 --> 01:23:47.889
WILL THAT SUPPOSED TO BE DONE IN

01:23:47.956 --> 01:23:49.924
THE NEXT PASSING CARS TO PACKAGE

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:55.764
I'M REGULARLY. SO LEFT THE WHOLE

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.366
FLOOR. A SORRY CAN I. SO IT'S

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:00.568
ALWAYS AREYOUR THANK. YOU CARDS

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.971
STAFF. WE AT ITS NEXT ROUND OF.

01:24:03.037 --> 01:24:04.739
RACE WHICH INCLUDE. NEW RAISE

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.074
STANDARDS PLUG IN HIGH. TO GROW

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:08.676
THAT ISSUE. SO THE ANSWER IS NO.

01:24:08.743 --> 01:24:10.745
AT YEAH IN THE IN THE C. A. R.

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:11.980
P. THAT'S AN IMMEDIATE FOLK

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.915
THAT'S THEY ARE WILL FALL OUT

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:17.419
SHORT THE SALES INCREASED. AND I

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.287
BELIEVE THAT WE RAISED RANGE

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:21.923
CAPS FOR PLUG IN HYBRIDS TO GO

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.825
AFTER THE REALLY LOW ONCE IN THE

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:24.893
PAST YEARS SAID WE HAVE MADE

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.928
SOME EFFORTS THERE. YEAH BUT I

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:29.330
GUESS- BEAT UP TO MAKE THIS

01:24:29.397 --> 01:24:31.032
POINT FOR YEARS I DON'T KNOW WHY

01:24:31.099 --> 01:24:32.534
WE'RE- REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:35.937
PEOPLE WHO TO BUY CARS. AND THEY

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:38.106
WERE STILL SUBSIDIZING GAS CARS

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:39.574
. GOT IT WE CAN TAKE THAT ON

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:41.309
BOARD A PROJECT FEEDBACK. YEP

01:24:41.376 --> 01:24:43.178
YOU'VE TAKEN THE FEEDBACK FOR

THOSE IN THE LOWEST INCOME

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:29.744
SEGMENT. UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:31.779
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:33.414
INVESTMENT THAT TAKES THAT

01:27:33.481 --> 01:27:34.983

NEED A HIGH NEED IN THAT SEGMENT

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.141
WHILE GRADES SO I TOTALLY

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.909

CHOOSE THE PRICE FIFTEEN HUNDRED

01:28:14.889 --> 01:28:18.559
DOLLARS- FOR THAT MATH TWENTY

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:21.763
EIGHT. THOUSAND LEVEL TWO

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.331
CHARGER SHOULD ONLY COST ABOUT

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:24.432
TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS SO

01:28:24.499 --> 01:28:25.633

THERE'S A CLEAR LACK OF SYNC

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:47.989
BETWEEN. THE VISUAL AND THE- AND

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.992

BEST TO GO A LITTLE BIT SLOWER

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.206
ON THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME LEVEL

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:06.874
TWO CHARGER BURST OPEN THAT OUT

01:29:06.941 --> 01:29:08.943
ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR

01:29:09.010 --> 01:29:10.478
INSTALLATION AND THAT WOULD

01:29:10.545 --> 01:29:13.181
INCLUDE YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:13.815
FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR

01:29:13.881 --> 01:29:15.717
THE L. TWO CHARTER BUT THEN

01:29:15.783 --> 01:29:17.685
ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED TOWARD

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:21.155
PAEL UPGRADE ADDING A CIRCUIT

01:29:21.222 --> 01:29:22.323
OR DOING OTHER THINGS THAT NEED

01:29:22.390 --> 01:29:23.758
TO HAPPEN. ON THE MULTI FAMILY

01:29:23.825 --> 01:29:25.293
HOME. AND IT'S INTERESTING

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:26.994
BECAUSE THIS IS ALSO A LEVEL TWO

01:29:27.061 --> 01:29:29.997
CHARGER FOR COPING OUT ABOUT

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:30.865
SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:32.533
CHARGE REPORT. AND WHAT'S REALLY

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.802
INTERESTING ABOUT THIS. IS A LOT

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.505
OF THE CLOCK IS ACTUALLY NOT THE

01:29:37.572 --> 01:29:39.107
CHARGER ITSELF. IT WILL WORK IN

01:29:39.173 --> 01:29:40.675
THE ENGINEERING TO HAVE TO GO

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.477
AROUND IT. EVERY FOOTPRINT EVERY

01:29:42.543 --> 01:29:43.778
SITE IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:45.680
THEY'RE ALL IN ENGINEERING

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:47.415
CONSTRUCTION PROJECT. THE

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:50.251
OFTENTIMES THINGS LIKE SHRINKING

01:29:50.318 --> 01:29:52.587
LAND ON CONDUIT AND WIRE PANEL

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:57.125
UPGRADE POSSIBLY OTHER THINGS.

01:29:57.191 --> 01:29:58.259
ARE REALLY THE BULK OF THE COT.

01:29:58.326 --> 01:29:59.794
AND THAT THE BIGGEST DRAW

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:01.329
BECAUSE- ISRAEL LENT. THE TRENCH

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:03.431
TO BE DONE SO DEPENDING ON WHAT

01:30:03.498 --> 01:30:05.633
THE POWER SOURCES. AND WHERE THE

01:30:05.700 --> 01:30:07.168
INFRASTRUCTURE IS CAN HAVE A

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:08.936
STRONG IMPACT TO THE COST OF

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:12.306
THAT. INTERESTINGLY WHILE COOLEY

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.040
TWO THOUSAND FOR A LEVEL TWO

01:30:13.107 --> 01:30:14.575
CHARGER ALL AND IN SINGLE FAMILY

01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:17.712
HOME WHERE THINK IT'S MORE LIKE

01:30:17.779 --> 01:30:20.181
SEVEN THOUSAND PER LEVEL TWO

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.849
CHARGER. IN AND YOUR DATE. AT

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.651
THE FOR THE MULTI FAMILY UNIT

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.686
DWELLINGS I GUESS WOULDN'T WIN

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:28.289
TO GET SOME. LEVEL OF SCALE

01:30:28.356 --> 01:30:29.757
BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT DOING ALL

01:30:29.824 --> 01:30:31.826
THAT WORK AND JUST PUTTING ONE

01:30:31.893 --> 01:30:33.728
OR TWO CHART YOU'RE PUTTING IN A

01:30:33.795 --> 01:30:35.296
NUMBER OF CHARGERS- SO WOULDN'T

01:30:35.363 --> 01:30:39.033
THAT PRICE. COME DOWN BELOW.

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:40.401
SEVEN THOUSAND THAT SEEMS FAIRLY

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:44.071
. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT. YEAH IT

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:45.907
DOES BUT THAT DOESN'T FACTOR IN

01:30:45.973 --> 01:30:47.074
THAT ECONOMY OF SCALE YOU'RE

01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:48.075
TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:30:48.142 --> 01:30:49.777
EXACTLY RIGHT YOU WOULDN'T WANT

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:51.078
TO DO A TRANSFER ONE CHARGER

01:30:51.145 --> 01:30:52.914
SOMEWHERE YOU WOULD DO IT

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.081
FRIENDS TO TEN OR FIFTEEN OR

01:30:54.148 --> 01:30:55.283
TWENTY CHARTER BUT YOU STILL

01:30:55.349 --> 01:30:57.285
HAVE THAT FIXED BECAUSE OF THE

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:59.687
TRANSUNION CONDUIT. AND LAYING

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:07.128
DOWN THE WIRE. OKAY EVEN EVEN

01:31:07.195 --> 01:31:09.163
WITH YOUR MATH I'M ONLY GETTING

01:31:09.230 --> 01:31:10.298

EIGHT THOUSAND CHARGERS.

01:31:37.992 --> 01:31:39.861
I COULD I COULD BEGIN MY MATH

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:42.663
WRONG BUT- NOW I CONFIRM THE

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.416
THERE WE'VE ALSO SEEN USED

01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:43.117
VEHICLE PURCHASES AND THAT'S

01:38:43.183 --> 01:38:44.785
TRUE IN BOTH OF THE PROGRAMS I

01:38:59.566 --> 01:39:00.934
THINK THE USED VEHICLE MARKETS A

01:39:01.001 --> 01:39:03.337
REALLY BIG DEAL AND I WAS NOTE

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.238
PARENTHETICALLY. THAT ON THE

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.706
REGULATORY SIDE A LOT OF WHAT

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.908
CARDS DOING ITS NEXT ROUND OF

01:39:07.975 --> 01:39:09.076
RAGS IS MAKING SURE THAT NEW CAR

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:11.045
STATE DURABLE THINKING INDICATE

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:11.945
THINGS LIKE BATTERY LIFE TO

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:14.081
CONSUMERS. SO TRYING TO MAKE

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.416
SURE THE USED VEHICLE MARKET FOR

01:39:15.482 --> 01:39:17.451
HE'S- ON HIS BOTH GROWING AND

01:39:17.518 --> 01:39:18.719
RELIABLE IN ADDITION TO THE

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.788
INCENTIVE PIECES. GOT GOT ENDED

01:39:20.854 --> 01:39:22.022
FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE ASSISTANCE

01:39:22.089 --> 01:39:23.691
PROGRAM YOU MENTIONED THE SIXTY

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:25.225
SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION. AND

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:27.361
HOW MAY IT WHAT THAT RESULTED IN

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.997
TERMS OF- I THINK I'VE MISSED

01:39:30.064 --> 01:39:31.398
WHAT YOU SAID BERMAN NUMBER

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:32.833
VEHICLES. ONLY A PROBLEM IS

01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:35.669
PERMANENT AND THAT AGAIN THAT

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:38.072
WAS ABOUT I THINK. TO PLAY IN

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:40.708
THIS BIG A LITTLE BIT OF PROCESS

01:39:40.774 --> 01:39:41.342
SINCE EIGHTEEN. THAT I'VE THOU

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:43.010
SEVEN AND NINETEEN AND MINOR.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:46.246
OKAY MADE IT TO TWENTY BUT NOW.

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:48.115
OKAY AND THAT AND NOT THE JUST

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.950
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY- BECAUSE I

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.752
DON'T HAVE ALL THE DETAILS FOR

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.087
THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM IN FRONT

01:39:53.153 --> 01:39:54.788
OF ME- THERE ARE. IS IT JUST

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:57.024
BECAUSE THE THERE'S A PRETTY

01:39:57.091 --> 01:39:59.026
SIGNIFICANT DELTA BETWEEN THOSE

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:01.261
TWO PROGRAMS IS JUST THE

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:03.297
STRUCTURE OF THE INCENTIVE. WHAT

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:05.666
SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS RIGHT- SO

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:07.601
JUST ENTER TO SAVE TOTAL

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:08.936
ALLOCATION SO I THINK THAT

01:40:09.002 --> 01:40:10.471
PROBABLY A LOT OF THAT. THE

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:11.839
SMALLER DOLLAR AMOUNTS FOR THE

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.974
CLEAN CARS WELL YEAH I MEAN

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:15.609
ALLOCATED FINANCING ASSISTANCE

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:16.176
HAD JUST SHY OF SIXTY EIGHT

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:17.611
MILLION. CONTRAST BROADHEAD

01:40:17.678 --> 01:40:19.079
AROUND A HUNDRED NINETY ONE

01:40:19.146 --> 01:40:20.247
MILLION ALLOCATED TO IT THAT'S

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:21.882
PROBABLY MOSTLY DRIVING THAT I'M

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:23.083
SORRY SUGGESTED HUNDRED NIGHT.

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:25.552
AT NINETY ONE MILLION OKAY GOT

01:40:25.619 --> 01:40:26.587
YEAH ONE NINETY ONE SO THAT'S

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:29.289
ONE ONE GOT IT THAT MAKES SENSE

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.391
THAT MAKES MORE SENSE. YEAH

01:40:30.457 --> 01:40:33.927

THE BUS ITSELF. AND FIFTY

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:26.853

THE CHARGING STATION BOTH

01:45:28.622 --> 01:45:31.124
COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM WOULD

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:31.992
BE ADMINISTERED. BY THE

GRANT PROGRAM TO PAY FOR BOTH.

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.366
PIECES OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:43.403
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:44.538

FRIEDMAN THANKS I HAVE A

01:45:45.939 --> 01:45:48.041
QUESTION- ACTUALLY PROBABLY TO

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:49.042
QUESTIONS ABOUT FLEET

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:52.112
INCENTIVES. THE FIRST IS IF YOU

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:53.513
CAN JUST OUTLINED WHAT'S

01:45:53.580 --> 01:45:55.882
AVAILABLE. FOR SMALLER FLEETS OF

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:58.251
WHO WANT TO CONVERT. DESERVES

01:45:58.318 --> 01:46:00.454
AND SECONDLY WHY THE DIFFERENCE

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:01.888
BETWEEN THE INCENTIVES GIVEN TO

01:46:01.955 --> 01:46:03.957
LARGE FLEETS AND THOSE GIVEN TO

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:05.792
SMALL FLEETS. AND HOW ARE YOU

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:08.962
LOOKING AT. FUELING TYPES AND

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:10.664
VEHICLE TYPE WITH FLEET

01:46:10.731 --> 01:46:14.101
INCENTIVES. FIRST LET ME START

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:15.736
OUT ON THIS AND- THERE'S LESS

01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:17.671
COMPLEX TO THIS SO WE CAN GO

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.740
BACK AND FORTH IS NEEDED. SO

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:20.807
GENERALLY SPEAKING- SEVERAL

01:46:20.874 --> 01:46:21.975
DIFFERENT WAYS PLEASE CAN

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:25.112
ACCESS- FUNDING INCLUDING THIRD

01:46:25.178 --> 01:46:26.713
WITH MY PROGRAM WHICH IS OUTSIDE

01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.282
OF THIS HEARING AND THEN R. H.

01:46:29.349 --> 01:46:32.486
V. I.P. PROGRAM. AND MEDIA.

01:46:32.552 --> 01:46:34.955
YEAH FUNDS BOTH FUEL CELL. AND

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:36.790
BATTERY TRUCKS. GENERALLY

01:46:36.857 --> 01:46:38.458
SPEAKING THE INCENTIVES ARE

01:46:38.525 --> 01:46:39.960
ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND

01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:41.828
DOLLARS. PER TRACK FOR BATTERY

01:46:41.895 --> 01:46:43.196
VEHICLES INVOLVED IN A FIFTY

01:46:43.263 --> 01:46:44.498
THOUSAND PER GRADE STRUCK. IT'S

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:45.999
ABOUT DOUBLE THAT FUEL CELLS

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.702
JUST REFLECTS THE TOTAL SCOPE.

01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.170
ON THE DIFFERENCE ON COST BASE

01:46:50.237 --> 01:46:51.671
WITH WHEELS OR TRACKS COST MORE

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:54.341
AS WE TRY TO MAKE UP THE

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:55.408
DIFFERENTIAL TO SOME DEGREE FOR

01:46:55.475 --> 01:46:56.877
FLEETS. YOU CAN ACCESS THIS-

01:46:56.943 --> 01:46:58.545
BASICALLY THROUGH THOSE VOUCHER

01:46:58.612 --> 01:47:00.647
PROGRAMS WHICH THE BOARD DECIDED

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:02.516
IN NOVEMBER I'M TO FOCUS

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:04.484
STEADILY MORE HEAVILY. ON SMALL

01:47:04.551 --> 01:47:09.790
FLEETS. IN TERMS OF OVERALL

01:47:09.856 --> 01:47:11.458
ACCESSIBILITY. AND THE GOAL HERE

01:47:11.525 --> 01:47:12.058
THE THINKING. IS THAT WE KNOW

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:14.261
THEY'RE A LOT OF FOLKS WHETHER

01:47:14.327 --> 01:47:14.861
IT'S OUR SMALL BUSINESSES OR

01:47:14.928 --> 01:47:16.263
SMALL MINORITY OF BUSINESSES

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:19.199
THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED. ON THE

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:20.066
TRANSITION BUT MERRY NOT HAVE

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:21.635
ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO WE'RE

01:47:21.701 --> 01:47:23.904
TRYING TO BE SMART IN TERMS OF

01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:25.505
WHERE WE ALLOCATE THIS CAPITAL.

01:47:25.572 --> 01:47:27.340
AN INMATE AT FOLKS WHO WE KNOW

01:47:27.407 --> 01:47:28.708
DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

01:47:28.775 --> 01:47:31.178
BROADER CAPITAL POOLS FOR THE

01:47:31.244 --> 01:47:39.920
WEEKEND. THAT ANSWER YOUR

01:47:39.986 --> 01:47:40.921
QUESTION ALL RIGHT- MISTER

BENNETT. THANK YOU AND AGAIN

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:46.526
THAT NUMBER QUESTIONS AND- IF

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.094
YOU CAN BE AS BRIEF AS POSSIBLE

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:50.130
ANSWERED APPRECIATED- ALL MY

01:47:50.197 --> 01:47:52.499
QUESTIONS HERE DEAL WITH AB

EIGHT THE- DIRECTION TO BUILD

01:47:55.068 --> 01:47:55.836
TWO HUNDRED HYDROGEN FUELING

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:57.804
STATIONS AN UNDER ABA CAN YOU

01:47:57.871 --> 01:48:00.707
TELL ME HOW MANY HAVE BEEN BUILT

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:06.246
SO FAR. YES THIS ENERGY

DIRECTION AT THE HUNDRED

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:11.685
STATIONS AND ON THE EXECUTIVE

01:48:11.751 --> 01:48:13.119
ORDER THREE HUNDRED STATIONS AND

01:48:13.186 --> 01:48:14.187
WE'RE CERTAINLY MARKING TOWARD

01:48:14.254 --> 01:48:15.922
THAT TWO HUNDRED STATION MARC.

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:18.124
WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE OPEN STATIONS

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:20.894
NOW. THIRTY THREE STATION IN

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:22.762
DEVELOPMENT I WILL HAVE A

01:48:22.829 --> 01:48:24.664
HUNDRED STATION DONE BY THE END

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:26.333
OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WITH THE

01:48:26.399 --> 01:48:27.801
GENERAL FUND MONEY WE GOT LAST

01:48:27.868 --> 01:48:29.836
YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO R.

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:32.172
TWO HUNDRED MARK BY ABOUT TWENTY

01:48:32.239 --> 01:48:33.240
TWENTY FIVE TWENTY TWENTY SIX.

K. AND CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE

01:48:35.342 --> 01:48:37.277
TIMETABLE IS BETWEEN WHEN WE-

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:40.180
AWARD MONEY FOR OF A STATION AND

01:48:40.247 --> 01:48:42.082
WHEN THE STATIONS ACTUALLY BUILT

01:48:42.148 --> 01:48:47.387
AND. AND OPEN FOR- BUSINESS.

01:48:47.454 --> 01:48:49.189
YEAH THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- IT

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:51.324
COULD VERY QUITE A BIT BUT WE'RE

01:48:51.391 --> 01:48:55.161
AVERAGING ABOUT TWO YEARS. AND

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:57.130
WE ARE EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT

01:48:57.197 --> 01:48:58.999
PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF SIMPLY

01:48:59.065 --> 01:48:59.966
GETTING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF

01:49:00.033 --> 01:49:02.469
HYDROGEN TO THOSE STATIONS- HAVE

01:49:02.535 --> 01:49:03.870
YOU SEEN ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

01:49:03.937 --> 01:49:07.173
IN THAT EQUATION- IN THE IN THE

01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:10.010
RECENT MONTHS. SOME GOOD

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:11.912
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT PRODUCTION IS

01:49:11.978 --> 01:49:14.147
INCREASING AND- ON THE ENERGY

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:15.882
COMMISSION SIDE OR INVESTMENTS

01:49:15.949 --> 01:49:16.783
HAVE ALSO BEEN GOING TOWARD FUEL

01:49:16.850 --> 01:49:18.785
PRODUCTION. WE AWARDED THREE

01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:20.654
MORE FUNDING GRANT EARLIER THIS

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:23.390
YEAR FOR CLEAN AND RENEWABLE

01:49:23.456 --> 01:49:24.557
FUEL PRODUCTION. AND THEN HOW

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:27.060
MANY OF THE STATIONS THAT WE

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:29.329
HAVE OF THAT THE OF THE SIXTY

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:30.697
FIVE THAT HAVE GONE IN SO FAR

01:49:30.764 --> 01:49:32.799
HOW MANY OF CONSERVE BOTH MEDIUM

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:35.135
AND HEAVY DUTY AS WELL AS LIGHT

01:49:35.201 --> 01:49:38.605
DUTY VEHICLES. DON'T HAVE A

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.240
NUMBER FOR WHAT ALREADY BEEN

01:49:40.307 --> 01:49:41.274
DEPLOYED BUT BETWEEN WHAT THE

01:49:41.341 --> 01:49:42.842
DEPLOYED AND WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

01:49:42.909 --> 01:49:44.311
FUNDED WHICH IS UNDER

01:49:44.377 --> 01:49:46.413
DEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE THIRTEEN

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:47.247
ONE THREE SECOND ALSO THIRD

01:49:47.314 --> 01:49:49.015
MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY. I'LL

01:49:49.082 --> 01:49:51.251
NOTE THAT WE'RE GOING TO LAUNCH

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:52.919
OF PETITIONS- THIS YEAR AS WELL

01:49:52.986 --> 01:49:54.955
TO ENCOURAGE THE MARKET TO DO

01:49:55.021 --> 01:49:56.523
THOSE THAT ARE DUAL PURPOSE.

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:57.891
LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER WITH MEDIUM

01:49:57.958 --> 01:49:59.793
DUTY HEAVY DUTY SO WELL OVER A

01:49:59.859 --> 01:50:02.195
CENTURY YOU BROUGHT UP THE DUAL

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.831
PURPOSE- HOW WHAT'S THE

01:50:04.898 --> 01:50:06.967
TECHNOLOGY THERE HOW HOW EASY IS

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:08.768
IT IS IT THE SAME NOZZLE OR DO

01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:10.337
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:11.938
NOZZLE BETWEEN HEAVY DUTY AND-

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:13.974
AND LIGHT DUTY. OF CAN WE YOU

01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:16.209
KNOW LIKE THE DIESEL IT USED TO

01:50:16.276 --> 01:50:17.944
BE ABLE TO. PULL UP WITH YOUR

01:50:18.011 --> 01:50:19.913
CAR AND THEN YOU YOU COULD GET

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:25.085
DIESEL OF YOU KNOW WHAT. TO AT

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.920
THE TRUCK STOP CAN YOU OF. IN

01:50:26.987 --> 01:50:27.954
LIGHT NATIONAL BIT INTO OF HOW

01:50:28.021 --> 01:50:30.056
COMPATIBLE WILL HEAVY DUTY AND

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:33.793
LIGHT DUTY. HYDROGEN FUELING BE

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.128
. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:37.497
THAT SO LET ME GET BACK TO YOU

01:50:37.564 --> 01:50:39.199
ALL KNOW THAT THE ONE WHO

01:50:39.265 --> 01:50:40.233
DECLINE NOW TYPICALLY HAVE TWO

01:50:40.300 --> 01:50:43.370
SIDES TO IT BUT THERE MAY BE A

01:50:43.436 --> 01:50:44.004
FAN LINE OR SOMETHING WHERE A

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:45.138
TRANSIT AGENCY ACCESS AND IT ON

01:50:45.205 --> 01:50:47.207
ITS SIDE. OF THE FENCE LINE WITH

01:50:47.273 --> 01:50:49.109
A CONSUMER FACING FIVE ON THE

01:50:49.175 --> 01:50:51.478
OTHER I DON'T KNOW IF THE NOVELS

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.445
ARE INTERCHANGEABLE BUT A LOT OF

01:50:52.512 --> 01:50:53.847
THAT POOR INFRASTRUCTURE MORE

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:55.949
THAN THIRTY ABOUT LET ME FIND

01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:58.051
OUT ABOUT THE NOVELTY. SO THE

01:50:58.118 --> 01:50:59.719
BUT THE CORE INFRASTRUCTURE SO

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:02.555
GENERALLY COULD WE COULD WE HAVE

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:05.925
ALL OF THEM- IN THE FUTURE BE

01:51:05.992 --> 01:51:08.261
ABLE TO SERVICE BOTH. MEDIUM AND

01:51:08.328 --> 01:51:12.599
HEAVY AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES.

01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:13.733
AND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES AT THE

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.969
SAME TIME. HERE RADICALLY I

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:18.038
THINK YES- MY ONLY COPY OUT IF

01:51:18.104 --> 01:51:19.939
WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ITS

01:51:20.006 --> 01:51:21.708
THIRD THAT PLEASE OFFICIALLY FOR

01:51:21.775 --> 01:51:23.276
THEIR OPERATION. AND STILL HAS A

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.744
GOOD CONSUMER EXPERIENCE FOR THE

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:27.380
CONSUMER NOT. TRYING TO DODGE-

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.749
CAN'T ABOUT THE- GREAT STRUCTURE

01:51:29.816 --> 01:51:31.217
I THINK THEORETICALLY YEAH BUT

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:32.919
WE WANT TO THINK THROUGH SOME OF

01:51:32.986 --> 01:51:34.721
THE PACIFIC. SO IF WE WERE ON

01:51:34.788 --> 01:51:36.956
THE INTERSTATE WE ARE AT A BIG

01:51:37.023 --> 01:51:37.824
TRUCK STOP WE COULD MAKE SURE

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:40.393
THAT ALL OF THOSE AT THAT TO ALL

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:41.261
THE HYDROGEN STATIONS PUT AT A-

01:51:41.327 --> 01:51:43.063
AT A- AT A LARGE TRUCK STOP

01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:45.498
WHERE THERE'S- THERE'S- A- LARGE

01:51:45.565 --> 01:51:46.566
AMOUNT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE OF

01:51:46.633 --> 01:51:49.436
DEVOTED TO- FUELING- IN THOSE

01:51:49.502 --> 01:51:53.706
SITUATIONS WE COULD CERTAINLY.

01:51:53.773 --> 01:51:56.276
HAVE THOSE ALL BE DUAL- DO

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:56.843
PURPOSE. HYDROGEN STATIONS

01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:59.345
CORRECT. I BELIEVE THAT'S THE

01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:00.680
CASE BUT LET ME CONFIRM I DON'T

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:02.182
WANNA GIVE YOU WRONG INFORMATION

01:52:02.248 --> 01:52:04.084
BUT I BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT

01:52:04.150 --> 01:52:05.585
I'LL GET BACK TO YOUR OFFICE OR

01:52:05.652 --> 01:52:08.088
NOT THANK YOU- AND THEN- JUMPING

01:52:08.154 --> 01:52:09.722
DOWN TO THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:11.191
THREE MILLION THE FEDERAL FUNDS

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:13.426
RESERVE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE

01:52:13.493 --> 01:52:15.628
WILL SEE THIS WELL THAT FUNDING

01:52:15.695 --> 01:52:18.064
BE AVAILABLE FOR SOME OF THESE

01:52:18.131 --> 01:52:18.965
HYDROGEN STATIONS ALSO ON THE

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.733
INTERSTATE THAT'S OVER AND ABOVE

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:24.370
THE TWO HUNDRED- THAT- WE NOW

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:28.041
HAVE AS A GOAL FROM THE GOVERNOR

01:52:28.108 --> 01:52:30.577
. FEDERAL COMPONENT HAS TO START

01:52:30.643 --> 01:52:31.277
THE FEDERAL FUNDING HAS TWO

01:52:31.344 --> 01:52:33.379
COMPONENTS. THE SECTION YOU'RE

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:35.682
TALKING TO IT FROM THE FIVE

01:52:35.748 --> 01:52:39.519
BILLION TOTAL. CALIFORNIA GETS

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:40.520
THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE

01:52:40.587 --> 01:52:41.087
EIGHTY FOUR MILLION. ON THAT

01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:42.856
HAVE TO BE FOR ELECTRIC

01:52:42.922 --> 01:52:44.324
VEHICLES. THANK YOU ALTHOUGH

01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:46.559
THERE THE TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

01:52:46.626 --> 01:52:49.395
COMPETITIVE. WHICH COULD GO TO

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.029
LECTOR KERR HYDROGEN. WE DON'T

01:52:50.096 --> 01:52:50.930
HAVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON THAT

01:52:50.997 --> 01:52:53.099
YET BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO BRING

01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:54.033
THAT CALIFORNIA TO. OKAY THANK

01:52:54.100 --> 01:52:55.635
YOU ALMOST FINISHED YOUR FOUR

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:56.536
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SUPPORT

01:52:56.603 --> 01:53:00.006
ELECTRIFICATION- AS- AS I'VE

01:53:00.073 --> 01:53:02.542
BEEN TALKING TO PORT OF HUENEME

01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:04.477
. INVENTOR COUNTY HERE COUNTY I

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:07.814
REPRESENT- THEY ARE OF REALLY

01:53:07.881 --> 01:53:09.782
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES.

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:11.518
OF THE PLANNING AND EVERYTHING

01:53:11.584 --> 01:53:13.553
THAT IS GOING TO TAKE TO

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.788
ELECTRIFY AND A PARTICULAR

01:53:15.855 --> 01:53:17.991
CONCERNED ABOUT ENOUGH ENERGY

01:53:18.057 --> 01:53:20.560
COMING. FROM THE GRID AT

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.428
ANALYZING THAT WITH THAT WITH

01:53:22.495 --> 01:53:25.231
THE I. O. SEASON SO WILL SOME OF

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:26.766
THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION BE

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:29.869
AVAILABLE. SO THAT THE PORTS CAN

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.539
COORDINATE WITH THE I. O. USED

01:53:32.605 --> 01:53:35.108
TO ENSURE THE PROPER PLANNING-

01:53:35.175 --> 01:53:37.143
OF BRINGING IN THE ELECTRICITY

01:53:37.210 --> 01:53:38.311
PROPER PLACEMENT OF THE

01:53:38.378 --> 01:53:39.879
EQUIPMENT EXCEPT FOR. WORDS ARE

01:53:39.946 --> 01:53:44.250
GOING TO BE DEVOTED ONLY TO THE

01:53:44.317 --> 01:53:46.653
EQUIPMENT ITSELF. UNDER THAT THE

01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.488
ATTACK THE QUESTION ON THE

01:53:48.555 --> 01:53:50.523
INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE- WE CAN ALSO

01:53:50.590 --> 01:53:52.926
FUND UP PLANNING BLUEPRINT GRANT

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:54.761
WE'VE DONE THAT IN THE PAST. THE

01:53:54.827 --> 01:53:56.863
CANDIDATE AND HIS MOTHER SO WE

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.631
COULD ACTUALLY FIND PLANNING

01:53:58.698 --> 01:54:01.000
BLUEPRINT FOR THE FUNDING OF

01:54:01.067 --> 01:54:02.368
WHILE- I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM MY

01:54:02.435 --> 01:54:04.837
COLLEAGUES YOU CAN FEEL. HEAVY

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:07.340
DUTY VEHICLES WITH A LIGHT DUTY

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:09.008
NOVEL IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:10.276
SLOWER. GREAT SHOW CAN BE DONE

01:54:10.343 --> 01:54:12.779
EXCELLENT- AND SO IT AND IT'S

01:54:12.845 --> 01:54:14.247
STILL UNANSWERED SO PLANNING FOR

01:54:14.314 --> 01:54:16.316
INTEGRATION- AND GRID

01:54:16.382 --> 01:54:18.651
UTILIZATION WILL BE. A ONE OF

01:54:18.718 --> 01:54:21.054
THE THINGS THAT THE PORTS CAN

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:22.255
USE A FOREIGNER MILLION DOLLARS

01:54:22.322 --> 01:54:24.757
FOR. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE CAR

01:54:24.824 --> 01:54:26.092
BESIDE BUT YET ON THE ON THE

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.260
ENERGY COMMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE

01:54:27.327 --> 01:54:31.130
SIDE WE COULD FIND- THE- GREAT

01:54:31.197 --> 01:54:33.032
THE CARD AND I CAN SPEAK FOR THE

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:33.967
CURBSIDE IN ABSOLUTELY SO WE'LL

FIGURE THIS OUT THE EXACT

01:54:35.468 --> 01:54:36.603
PARAMETERS OF THIS PROJECT THE

01:54:36.669 --> 01:54:38.771
PUBLIC PROCESS BUT WE'VE HAD A

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:39.973
GOOD RELATIONSHIP TWENTY ME. WE

KNOW IN GENERAL THAT FOR ALL THE

01:54:42.175 --> 01:54:43.810
COURTS THEY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:54:43.876 --> 01:54:44.877
THESE IMMIGRATION ISSUES AND I

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:46.646
HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING AND-

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:47.880
THE ANY PUBLIC PROCESS WOULDN'T

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:49.749
TURN OUT A CLEAR NEED TO THINK

01:54:49.816 --> 01:54:51.484
ABOUT PLANNING INTEGRATION GIVEN

01:54:51.551 --> 01:54:53.253
THEIR NEEDS. GREAT THANK YOU UP

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:55.021

COMMENTS AND ONE IS THAT- AS

01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.125
WE'RELOOKING AT THE HYDROGEN

01:54:59.192 --> 01:55:00.793
ELECTRIC FEELINGS DID YOU

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:02.862
RECHARGING AND SORT OF THE

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:04.631
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE OUT THERE.

01:55:04.697 --> 01:55:06.399
THEY'RE REALLY JUST BOTH OF THEM

01:55:06.466 --> 01:55:08.868
HAVEUNIQUE ADVANTAGES TO- YOU

01:55:08.935 --> 01:55:10.870
KNOW- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:12.138
BATTERY TECHNOLOGY YOU KNOW

01:55:12.205 --> 01:55:13.840
PEOPLE HAVE ELECTRICITY IN THEIR

01:55:13.906 --> 01:55:14.841
HOMES I CAN PLUG THEIR CARS IN

01:55:14.907 --> 01:55:16.576
THEIR HOMES THEY DON'T HAVE

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:17.744
HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AT

01:55:17.810 --> 01:55:20.546
HOME. ON THE OTHER HAND- AS- MY

01:55:20.613 --> 01:55:22.515
COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT THAT. JUST

01:55:22.582 --> 01:55:24.817

CHARGE THEIR VEHICLES AT A AT-

01:55:34.127 --> 01:55:35.028
CHARGING STATIONS ON THE

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.696
INTERSTATES YOU KNOW AS ARE

01:55:36.763 --> 01:55:38.965
DRIVING GO EAT IT. IT IN BUT

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:40.333
HYDROGEN COULD BE TREATED JUST

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:41.634
LIKE GASOLINE YOU COULD HVE

01:55:41.701 --> 01:55:42.669
MANY HYDROGEN TANKS YOU HAVE

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:44.637
LOTS OF PEOPLE COME IN FUEL UP

01:55:44.704 --> 01:55:45.838
IN IN FIVE MINUTES. SO I'M

HYDROGEN I THINK THERE THERE'S

01:56:00.520 --> 01:56:03.122
MORE FLEXIBILITY IN MANY WAYS-

01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:04.924
WITH ELECTRIC BATTERIES THERE IS

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:08.227
TO IT. YOU CAN HAVE- DATE TO

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:09.962
CHARGING TAKING PLACE IN IN IN

01:56:10.029 --> 01:56:12.865
PEOPLE'S HOMES- AND SO I JUST

FORWARD- IF NOT MORE AS. BETTER

01:56:32.051 --> 01:56:33.052
TECHNOLOGY COMES COMES FORWARD

01:56:33.119 --> 01:56:34.954
AND THEN FINALLY AB WE HAD A

MILLION. FOR THE BATTERY

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:44.030
REPLACEMENT ONLY BECAUSE I THINK

01:56:44.097 --> 01:56:45.164
IT'S SO MUCH BETTER OF AN

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:46.866
INVESTMENT. YOU DON'T HAVE TO

01:56:46.933 --> 01:56:48.935
HAVE THE COST OF BUYING A IT-

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:50.570

COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION

01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:29.235
PROGRAM. SO BEFORE I START I

01:58:29.302 --> 01:58:30.870
WANTED TO NOTE THAT NEARLY ONE

01:58:30.937 --> 01:58:32.638
THIRD OF CALIFORNIANS

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:34.407
PREDOMINANTLY PEOPLE OF COLOR

01:58:34.474 --> 01:58:36.776
LIVE THE OVER FOUR HUNDRED

01:58:36.843 --> 01:58:38.211
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES THAT

01:58:38.277 --> 01:58:40.146
DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFER FROM

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:41.948
DIRTY AIR. SO IF YOU ARE ONE OF

01:58:42.014 --> 01:58:43.649
THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVE IN

01:58:43.716 --> 01:58:45.451
A COMMUNITY THAT SUFFERS FROM

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:47.854
DIRTY AIR ON AVERAGE YOU WILL

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.989
BREATHE AIR THAT HAS TWICE THE

01:58:50.056 --> 01:58:52.058
AMOUNT OF CANCER CAUSING DIESEL

01:58:52.124 --> 01:58:54.026
PARTICULATES AND SOMEONE THAT

01:58:54.093 --> 01:58:56.629
LIVES IN A MORE FLUID COMMUNITY.

01:58:56.696 --> 01:58:58.764
WITH CLEANER AIR SO THIS BURDEN

01:58:58.831 --> 01:59:00.633
ON WHO SUFFERS FROM DIRTY AIR

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:04.971
AND WHO DOESN'T IT DIRECTLY. I

01:59:05.037 --> 01:59:08.541
GOOD YOUR OF IT NOT WHAT IT WAS

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:11.844
WHEN YOU BURKE YEAH WE'VE HEARD

01:59:11.911 --> 01:59:14.981
THAT IT DIFFICULT ABOUT- AND I'M

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:19.352
NOT SURE ABOUT YOUR AND ARMENIA

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:20.753
- IF YOU COULD TRY TO WE GOT

01:59:20.820 --> 01:59:24.156
THIS. BIT MORE. LIKE YOU WERE.

01:59:24.223 --> 01:59:30.463
OF OKAY IS THAT BETTER. ALL

HERE- INSTEAD BUT I'M- SO THIS

01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:43.276
BURDEN ON WHOSE FOR DIRTY AND

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:44.043
DOES. IT'S A DIRECT OF THE LAW

KNOW AS FAR AIR DISTRICTS ARE

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:59.405
DENYING THESE APPLICATIONS OUT

02:07:59.471 --> 02:08:02.041
FOR DISCOURAGING- COMMUNITIES TO

02:08:02.107 --> 02:08:04.443
APPLY- YOU KNOW THAT'S THE

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:06.378
CONCERN THAT I HAVE. IN THAT

02:08:06.445 --> 02:08:08.947
WHAT ARE WE DOING- TO PREVENT

02:08:09.014 --> 02:08:10.983
THAT FROM HAPPENING TO THEIR

02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:14.053
DISTRICTS NEED MORE RESOURCES-

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:17.489
OR JUST. YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO

02:08:17.556 --> 02:08:18.490
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:22.828
COMMUNITIES THAT. WANT TO

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:23.829
PARTICIPATE ARE ABLE TO

02:08:23.896 --> 02:08:25.898
PARTICIPATE. WHO- I WILL IN I

02:08:25.964 --> 02:08:28.300
TURNING ON MY CAMERA AND TRY TO

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:29.535
SPEAK S. AS POSSIBLE. THE

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:31.904
LEGISLATURE THANKS THE AMOUNT

02:08:31.970 --> 02:08:34.239
FOR THE AIR DISTRICTS- IF THERE

02:08:34.306 --> 02:08:36.442
IS A CONVERSATION TO INCREASE

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:39.044
THAT AMOUNT AND THAT WOULD BE

02:08:39.111 --> 02:08:40.913
INCREDIBLY HELPFUL YOU ARE RATE

02:08:40.979 --> 02:08:43.982
THAT IMPERIAL- WE TOOK A PAUSE

02:08:44.049 --> 02:08:46.351
ON THAT APPLICATION- I'M A PART

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:48.520
OF IT IS RESOURCE AND- I THINK

02:08:48.587 --> 02:08:50.189
THE SAME CHALLENGES SOUTH COAST

02:08:50.255 --> 02:08:52.091
HAS ALSO PROBABLY BROUGHT UP I

02:08:52.157 --> 02:08:53.692
MEAN. WE'RE MORE AND MORE

02:08:53.759 --> 02:08:56.395
COMMUNITIES ARE WANTING TO BE

02:08:56.462 --> 02:08:57.329
SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES AND

02:08:57.396 --> 02:09:00.065
QUITE FRANKLY FUNDING IS FLAT.

02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:04.203
SO YOU WILL HEAR ASKING YOU FOR

02:09:04.269 --> 02:09:05.871
IT AND IF I'M JUST BEING. AND

02:09:05.938 --> 02:09:07.106
TRYING TO TALK SLOWLY. WE ARE

02:09:07.172 --> 02:09:09.108
ASKING YOU FOR THE SAME AMOUNT

02:09:09.174 --> 02:09:10.075
AND YET WE ARE THINKING IF

02:09:10.142 --> 02:09:12.311
ANYTHING- COMMUNITIES THERE'S

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:13.846
OVER FORTY COMMUNITIES THAT WANT

02:09:13.912 --> 02:09:16.115
TO BE A PART OF THAT'S AN R. P.

02:09:16.181 --> 02:09:17.049
THINK IT'S EXTREMELY SLOW

02:09:17.116 --> 02:09:19.718
BECAUSE OF THAT SO. IF THERE CAN

02:09:19.785 --> 02:09:20.319
BE A CONVERSATION AROUND AN

02:09:20.385 --> 02:09:22.521
INCREASE OF RESOURCES WE WOULD

02:09:22.588 --> 02:09:24.056
GREATLY WELCOME IT BECAUSE EVEN

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.624
THOUGH WE ARE THINKING ABOUT

02:09:25.691 --> 02:09:26.692
RESETTING THIS PROGRAM AND ARE

02:09:26.758 --> 02:09:28.494
HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:29.228
BOTH THE COMMUNITIES AND THE AIR

02:09:29.294 --> 02:09:31.263
DISTRICT. IT DOESN'T NEGATE THE

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.298
POINT THAT WE HAVE FAR MORE

02:09:33.365 --> 02:09:35.067
COMMUNITIES AND WE ACTUALLY DO

02:09:35.134 --> 02:09:36.835
RESOURCES TO DO THIS IMPORTANT

02:09:36.902 --> 02:09:39.138
TYPE OF WORK. OKAY I'M

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:39.905
INTERESTED IN HAVING THAT

02:09:39.972 --> 02:09:42.641

FUNDING. AND REALLY KIND OF ON

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.715
AN ANNUAL BASIS DEPENDING ON ON

MONEY THAT. WE HAVE TO BE COMING

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.931
INTO THE FINANCIAL THAT DOES

CHANGE. THE ANNUAL. UP WITH A

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.339
FUNDING. THE ONE POINT THAT I

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:30.309
THINK WOULD BE A- ON. BLACK YEAR

02:12:30.375 --> 02:12:32.577
- TWENTY ONE A MALE. YOU KNOW AS

02:12:32.644 --> 02:12:34.513
AS THEY WERE. THE TWENTY TWENTY

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:35.947
ONE OUT BY ACT IT INCLUDED

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:38.784
BASICALLY TO. OR OF CAP AND

02:12:38.850 --> 02:12:41.386
TRADE FUNDING. FOR THE- PORTION

02:12:41.453 --> 02:12:44.156
. BECAUSE THEY'RE WAS NOT A CAP

02:12:44.222 --> 02:12:44.956
AND TRADE PLAN THAT WOULD.

02:12:45.023 --> 02:12:47.025
ADOPTED FOR TWENTY TWENTY. AND

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:49.094
VOTE THAT MONEY BASICALLY ALL

02:12:49.161 --> 02:12:51.196
ROLLED OVER. AND THERE WERE

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.831
LARGER INVESTMENT BECAUSE THERE

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:55.067
WAS MORE MONEY AVAILABLE BECAUSE

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:56.034
THEY WILL TWO YEARS WORTH OF

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:58.904
DISCRETIONARY REVENUE AND AT. SO

02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:00.272
THAT'S WHY NOW WE'RE GOING BACK

02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:01.773
TO THE PEOPLE YEAR WORTH OF

02:13:01.840 --> 02:13:03.942
REVENUE SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:06.745
OLDER. LOWER OVERALL AMOUNT I

02:13:06.812 --> 02:13:08.046
WHICH WHICH YOU KNOW THAT'S WHY

02:13:08.113 --> 02:13:09.981

THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:13:18.523 --> 02:13:21.226
CLARIFYING- JUST MADE. I JUST

02:13:21.293 --> 02:13:22.661
GATHER OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE TO

02:13:22.728 --> 02:13:24.062
IT WHEN IT COMES THE

02:13:24.129 --> 02:13:27.532
DISCRETIONARY- WORKING. AT THIS

02:13:27.599 --> 02:13:30.769
YEAR WE HAVE TO DO A LOWER.

02:13:30.836 --> 02:13:32.104
INCOME EARNERS BUDGET A LOWER

02:13:32.170 --> 02:13:33.972

. POTENTIAL REVENUE INCREASES.

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:34.166
THAT WE THOUGHT THIS LAST OPTION

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:36.034
WILL BE A OF MAY REPAIRS. AND

02:14:36.101 --> 02:14:37.536

THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WE'VE

YOU BEFORE BUT- WE JUST WANTED

02:15:00.926 --> 02:15:02.727
TO. WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

02:15:02.794 --> 02:15:03.895
COMMENT ON KIND OF THE SPENDING

02:15:03.962 --> 02:15:04.963
ITEM OF AB SIX SEVENTEEN OF

02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:06.064
COURSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

02:15:06.131 --> 02:15:07.032
THE LEGISLATURE HAS-

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:08.867
CONSISTENTLY FUNDED OUT OF ITS-

02:15:08.934 --> 02:15:10.635
ARE UP- CAP AND TRADE

02:15:10.702 --> 02:15:12.437

VERY BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE GDR

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:19.077
UP REVENUE PICTURE- AND THE

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:21.813
SHORT STORY IS THAT- REVENUE IS

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.948
TRACKING ABOVE THE

02:15:23.014 --> 02:15:25.183
ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:26.151
THAT WERE BUILT INTO THE JANUARY

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:27.919
BUDGETS. AND WE DO THINK THAT

02:15:27.986 --> 02:15:29.955
REVENUE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:30.489
THAN THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:15:30.555 --> 02:15:32.757
ASSUMPTIONS- OF COURSE AS THE

02:15:32.824 --> 02:15:33.792
COMMITTEE OF THE WHERE THERE'S

02:15:33.859 --> 02:15:36.528
A- LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND CAP

02:15:36.595 --> 02:15:37.596
AND TRADE REVENUE AND THERE'S

02:15:37.662 --> 02:15:39.064
VERY GOOD REASON TO BE CAUTIOUS

ALEJO. ROSS BROWN AGAIN WITH THE

02:20:18.009 --> 02:20:20.512
L. A. O. SO THIS IS THE THIRTY

02:20:20.578 --> 02:20:21.913
MILLION IS REALLY THE ONLY OF

02:20:21.980 --> 02:20:23.815
NEW PROGRAM THAT'S PART OF THIS

02:20:23.882 --> 02:20:26.151
YEAR'S. PROPOSALS PART OF THE

02:20:26.217 --> 02:20:28.486
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN-

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:30.522
IN CONCEPTS WE DO THINK THAT

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:32.190
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THAT BOTH THE

02:20:32.257 --> 02:20:33.725
SCOPE AND QUALITY OF AIR QUALITY

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:34.959
MONITORING SETUP MERIT AS THERE

02:20:35.026 --> 02:20:36.728
ARE SOME GAPS IN THE EXISTING

02:20:36.795 --> 02:20:38.296
AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORKS

02:20:38.363 --> 02:20:40.231
NETWORKS- PARTICULARLY AT THE

02:20:40.298 --> 02:20:42.600
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL. HOWEVER

02:20:42.667 --> 02:20:44.836
BASED ON OUR INITIAL REVIEW IT'S

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:46.805
UNCLEAR WHY THIS PARTICULAR

02:20:46.871 --> 02:20:48.506
PROPOSAL IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE

02:20:48.573 --> 02:20:50.341
MONITORING APPROACH AND RAISES A

02:20:50.408 --> 02:20:52.076
LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR US SO AS

02:20:52.143 --> 02:20:53.344
THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THIS

02:20:53.411 --> 02:20:54.612
PROPOSAL IN WAYS THAT AGAINST

02:20:54.679 --> 02:20:56.514
OTHER SPENDING PRIORITIES. SOME

02:20:56.581 --> 02:20:57.615
QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT WANT TO

02:20:57.682 --> 02:21:00.919
CONSIDER INDIRECT ADMINISTRATION

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:02.854
TO REPORT ON INCLUDE. WHY IS.

02:21:02.921 --> 02:21:04.022
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED TO

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:05.256
STOP A NEW MONITORING APPROACH

02:21:05.323 --> 02:21:06.991
INSTEAD OF EXPANDING EXISTING

02:21:07.058 --> 02:21:08.726
MONITORING EFFORTS SUCH AS THE

02:21:08.793 --> 02:21:11.162
EFFORTS THROUGH AB SIX SEVENTEEN

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:12.764
WHICH YOU JUST DISCUSSED. WHAT

02:21:12.831 --> 02:21:14.332
IS THE ADVANTAGE TO USING MOBILE

02:21:14.399 --> 02:21:15.300
MONITORING COMPARED TO OTHER

02:21:15.366 --> 02:21:16.935
TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS STATIONARY

02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:19.070
MONITORS THAT CAN MEASURE

02:21:19.137 --> 02:21:21.206
POLLUTION AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:22.640
. TO THE STATE INVEST IN A ONE

02:21:22.707 --> 02:21:24.342
TIME **** SNAPSHOT OF AIR

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:26.177
POLLUTION RATHER THAN IN A

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:28.813
SYSTEM THAT CAN HELP. THE STATE

02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:29.948
TRACK CHANGES IN AIR POLLUTION

02:21:30.014 --> 02:21:32.016
OVER TIME- I WILL THE FUNDING BE

02:21:32.083 --> 02:21:33.785
USED TO INFORM FUTURE AIR

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:35.286
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES

02:21:35.353 --> 02:21:37.555
SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHAT THE

02:21:37.622 --> 02:21:38.356
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS

02:21:38.423 --> 02:21:39.691
COLLECTED FROM THE SEPARATE HOW

02:21:39.757 --> 02:21:40.959
WILL THAT INFORMATION BE USED TO

02:21:41.025 --> 02:21:42.927
INFORM FUTURE REGULATORY OR

02:21:42.994 --> 02:21:44.863
SPENDING DECISIONS. AND THEN

02:21:44.929 --> 02:21:47.165
FINALLY- THIS IS A ONE TIME KIND

02:21:47.232 --> 02:21:49.734
OF ALLOCATION AS PROPOSED BUT-

02:21:49.801 --> 02:21:50.902
AND A GOOD QUESTION FOR US AS

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:52.937
WELL THE STATE HAVE ANY ONGOING

02:21:53.004 --> 02:21:54.038
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH.

02:21:54.105 --> 02:21:55.540
UNDERTAKING THIS EFFORT- KIND OF

02:21:55.607 --> 02:21:57.342
ONCE THE RESULTS THAT THE

02:21:57.408 --> 02:21:59.611
INITIAL RESULTS ARE. ARE ARE IN

02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:01.012
INTO THE KIND OF CREATE AN

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:03.314
EXPECTATION OF KIND OF AN

02:22:03.381 --> 02:22:03.882
ONGOING EFFORT. SO WE THINK

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:04.716
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE

02:22:04.782 --> 02:22:06.584
QUESTIONS REALLY COULD HELP THE

02:22:06.651 --> 02:22:07.719
LEGISLATURE OF VALUE WAIT THE

02:22:07.785 --> 02:22:09.420
OVERALL MERITS OF THE PROPOSAL.

02:22:09.487 --> 02:22:11.689
WITHOUT THAT ADDITIONAL DETAIL-

02:22:11.756 --> 02:22:12.957
WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

02:22:13.024 --> 02:22:14.192
WANT TO CONSIDER REDIRECTING

02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:15.894
THIS FUNDING TO OTHER EXISTING

02:22:15.960 --> 02:22:16.928
PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGH

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:22.634
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SO. AND

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:24.302
THAT COMMENTS THANKS. THANK YOU

02:22:24.369 --> 02:22:25.103
MISTER BROWN- MISS JANGANLAH ME

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:28.239
ASK YOU- A FOLLOW UP TO THE

02:22:28.306 --> 02:22:32.043
QUESTIONS THAT- THE ALEJO- WAS

02:22:32.110 --> 02:22:36.848
POSING- WHY WHAT WHY WOULD WE

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:38.449
WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY AT

02:22:38.516 --> 02:22:41.286
THAT IS THAT'S IN A PROGRAM.

02:22:41.352 --> 02:22:42.720
THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A ONE TIME

02:22:42.787 --> 02:22:47.458
SNAPSHOT AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING-THAT IS MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND

02:22:47.525 --> 02:22:50.328
SYSTEMATIC THAT ATTRACTS CHANGES

02:22:50.395 --> 02:22:52.363
IN AIR POLLUTION OVER A LONGER

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:56.301
PERIOD OF TIME. SO IN THIS

02:22:56.367 --> 02:22:59.070
PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW ITS TO GET

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:01.773
KIND OF THIS BASS. FOR EMISSIONS

02:23:01.839 --> 02:23:03.441
IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE ENTIRE

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:05.510
STATE AND YOU HEARD MS FLETCHER

TO. REIMAGINE THE EIGHTY SIX ONE

02:23:10.715 --> 02:23:12.083
SEVEN FOR GRAHAM. I DON'T THINK

02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:13.952
ABOUT HOW WE PROVIDE BENEFITS

02:23:14.018 --> 02:23:15.553
NOT JUST TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT

02:23:15.620 --> 02:23:17.188
HAVE BEEN SORT OF FORMALLY

02:23:17.255 --> 02:23:18.990
SELECTED INTO THE PROGRAM THE

02:23:19.057 --> 02:23:20.591
COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE.

02:23:20.658 --> 02:23:21.960
AND SO WHAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD

AIR QUALITY IN THEIR COMMUNITY

02:23:44.782 --> 02:23:46.651
IS- DEPENDING ON WHAT WE SEE IN

02:23:46.718 --> 02:23:48.553
THAT MONITORING IT MIGHT GIVE US

02:23:48.619 --> 02:23:50.488
SOME CLUES ABOUT SOURCES THAT WE

02:23:50.555 --> 02:23:52.190

THINGS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WELL I

02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:08.806

BACK AND MONITOR AIR QUALITY SO

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:29.353
THAT WE CAN COMPARE THAT AGAINST

02:25:29.420 --> 02:25:31.089
THE SNAPSHOT SO LET ME ASK MY

02:25:31.155 --> 02:25:34.192

02:26:14.165 --> 02:26:16.334
QUESTION. SO WE HAVE A NETWORK

02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:18.269
OF ABOUT FOURTEEN TOXICS

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:20.371
MONITORING SITES RIGHT NOW

02:26:20.438 --> 02:26:22.340

WE CAN USE THOSE SITES T

02:26:29.814 --> 02:26:32.150
EVALUATE THEIR- VERY

02:26:32.216 --> 02:26:34.352
SOPHISTICATED. MONITORING IN

02:26:34.418 --> 02:26:37.321

THOSE SITES SO OVER. THE AND

02:26:45.496 --> 02:26:46.998
OVER THE YEARS WE CAN SEE WE'VE

02:26:47.064 --> 02:26:48.866
SEEN REDUCTIONS IN PRETTY MUCH

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.968
ALL TOXICS AT ALL OF THOSE

02:26:51.035 --> 02:26:53.171
