LOITERING SIGNIFICANTLY

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:23.679

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.528
SPEAKER I TO RISE IN OPPOSITION

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.363
TO THIS BILL THIS DOES NOT MAKE

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:37.299
COMMUNITIES SAFER FOR ONE WHO

01:20:37.365 --> 01:20:39.167
HAS WORKED A LONG TIME IN

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:40.168
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AFFECTED

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:42.904
WITH THIS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:46.942
IT IS NOT VERY HARD. TO SEE

01:20:47.008 --> 01:20:48.476
WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE ARE

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.845
HANGING OUT ON THE CORNERS AND

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.681
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE APPROACH.

01:20:52.747 --> 01:20:54.349
POLICE ARE TRYING TO REMOVE

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.584
THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY FROM

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.752
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THESE

01:20:57.819 --> 01:20:58.520
COMMUNITIES AND THE FAMILIES

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.622
THAT LIVE THERE. DO NOT WANT TO

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:01.957
BE SUBJECTED TO THIS OR HAVE

01:21:02.023 --> 01:21:04.459
THEIR KIDS SUBJECTED TO HAVING

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.328
TO WALK THROUGH THESE AREAS ANY

01:21:06.394 --> 01:21:08.430
MORE THAN ANY OTHER FAMILY IN

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:11.099
ANY OTHER COMMUNITY. SO THIS

01:21:11.166 --> 01:21:12.934
ALSO TAKES ANOTHER TOOL AWAY

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.337
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT TO TRY TO

01:21:15.403 --> 01:21:17.806
HELP DEAL WITH THIS. THE SEX

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:19.374
TRAFFICKING ISSUE HAS BEEN

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.109
CLEARLY- TALKED ABOUT BY

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.178
SEVERAL MEMBERS IN HERE AND MY

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.980
COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA CLARITA.

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:27.015
AND THEN IT IS THAT'S TRUE THE

01:21:27.082 --> 01:21:29.117
POLICE HAVE VERY FEW TOOLS TO

01:21:29.184 --> 01:21:30.986
BE ABLE TO TAKE SOMEBODY OUT.

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:33.088
OF THE SYSTEM TO FIND OUT

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:33.989
WHETHER THEY DO WANT HELP OR

01:21:34.055 --> 01:21:36.524
NOT. AND IF THEY DON'T WANT

01:21:36.591 --> 01:21:37.626
HELP THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STAY

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:39.728
IN JAIL THEY GET RELEASED WE

01:21:39.794 --> 01:21:41.263
DON'T EVEN PUT PEOPLE IN JAIL

01:21:41.329 --> 01:21:43.064
THAT STILL NINE HUNDRED FORTY

01:21:43.131 --> 01:21:43.531
NINE DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.867
MERCHANDISE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:47.068
NOT JAILING PROSTITUTES

01:21:47.135 --> 01:21:49.904
ANYMORE. SO THERE ARE THERE IS

01:21:49.971 --> 01:21:51.906
A PLETHORA REASONS FOR NOT

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:54.576
DOING THIS BUT THE PRIMARY ONE

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:57.712
IS IT DOES NOT MAKE COMMUNITIES

01:21:57.779 --> 01:22:01.516
SAFER. IT DOES NOT. SO WE NEED

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.852

01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:06.321
TAKING AWAY THE TOOLS THAT ARE

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:08.723
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS NEED

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.859
TO CLEAN UP OUR COMMUNITIES.

01:22:10.925 --> 01:22:13.695

EXPERIENCE BUT LET ME TELL YOU

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.905
WHAT WE DO IN FRESNO. WE HAVE A

ROBUST. CONNECTION WITH MANY

SEX TRAFFICKING ORGANIZATIONS.

01:30:54.749 --> 01:30:58.319
THAT HAVE SAFE HOUSES AND

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:58.786
RELATIONSHIPS WITH LAW

01:30:58.853 --> 01:31:02.557
ENFORCEMENT. AND IT IS TOOLS

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:06.027
LIKE THIS. THAT ALLOW OUR

POLICE. TO SEPARATE. THE VICTIM

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:14.735
ON THE STREET. WITH THE

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:15.303
PAMPHLETS DOWN THE BLOCK AND

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.705
AROUND THE CORNER. AND WHEN WE

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:20.675
SEPARATE. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

01:31:20.741 --> 01:31:23.845

HAVE BEEN OTHERS IN OUR

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:02.717
COMMUNITY. I THINK IT'S

01:32:02.783 --> 01:32:04.318
DIFFICULT FOR YOU TO FULLY

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:07.054
UNDERSTAND WHY THESE TOOLS

01:32:07.121 --> 01:32:12.927
MATTER. IT IS A PROTECTION. FOR

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:16.631
CUSTODY. KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:17.865
THE PIMP THAT'S GOING TO BEAT

01:32:17.932 --> 01:32:19.333
HIM UP SCARED TO DEATH. HURT

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.103
THEM. THAT SEPARATION TAKES

01:32:22.169 --> 01:32:27.008
PLACE. AND THEN THEY ARE HELPED.

01:32:27.074 --> 01:32:29.777
THESE ARE THE KIND OF TOOLS.

01:32:29.844 --> 01:32:30.378
AND THEY'RE BEING EFFECTIVELY

01:32:30.444 --> 01:32:36.250
USED. TO RESCUE THE VICTIMS. WE

01:32:36.317 --> 01:32:37.752
NEED TO MAINTAIN THOSE KINDS OF

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:40.388
TOOLS. NOT BECAUSE WE'RE

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:46.093
TARGETING. WE'RE PROTECTING.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:48.429
THAT'S HOW WE USE IT IT'S WHY

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:50.264
IT NEEDS TO REMAIN BECAUSE IT'S

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:54.769
EFFECTIVE IN SAVING. CARING FOR

01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.537
AND TRANSPORTING THESE

01:32:56.604 --> 01:32:58.973
INDIVIDUALS TO SAFE HOUSES AND

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:04.879
PLACES WHERE THEY CAN GET HELP.

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:08.983

ON THIS BILL BUT JUST.

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:16.524
LISTENING TO THE DIFFERENT

01:33:16.590 --> 01:33:20.161
ARGUMENTS- THERE IS A LOT THAT

01:33:20.227 --> 01:33:23.030
WE NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THOSE

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:23.831
WHO ARE BEING SECTION SEX

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.900
TRAFFICKED NOT JUST IN THIS

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.268
RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT JUST

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:29.337
FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS IT FALLS

01:33:29.403 --> 01:33:31.439
ON OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BECAUSE

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:32.173
MANY OF THESE KIDS ARE IN

01:33:32.239 --> 01:33:33.874
SCHOOL SYSTEM INVOLVED IN AS IN

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.443
THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. WHEN

01:33:35.509 --> 01:33:36.377
THEY COME INTO THE EMERGENCY

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:37.545
ROOM FOR TREATMENT AND

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:38.946
SCREENING AND WHEN WE FIND OUT

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:41.148
THAT THEY HAVE EITHER INFECTION

01:33:41.215 --> 01:33:45.219
OR PREGNANCY AND THERE'S A LOT

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:47.154
OF. THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE.

01:33:47.221 --> 01:33:50.124
BUT THIS BILL REALLY TALKS

01:33:50.191 --> 01:33:53.160
ABOUT PROFILING. AND WE'VE

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:55.963
ALREADY SAID HERE ON THIS FLOOR

01:33:56.030 --> 01:33:56.597
THAT WE DON'T AGREE WITH RACIAL

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:59.166
PROFILING. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING

01:33:59.233 --> 01:34:00.301
TO GIVE SOMEBODY A GANG

01:34:00.368 --> 01:34:01.469
ENHANCEMENT BUT YOU HAVE TO

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:03.938
HAVE PROOF. AND SO WHAT THIS

01:34:04.005 --> 01:34:07.241
BILL BASICALLY SPACES YOU CAN'T

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:07.808
ARREST SOMEBODY FOR HOW THEY

01:34:07.875 --> 01:34:12.213
LOOK. WHERE THEY'RE WALKING. OR

01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:16.517
WHO THEY MAY LOVE. YOU NEED TO

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:19.553
ACTUALLY CATCH THEM IN THAT ACT.

01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.022
AND SO IT'S NOT A BILL THAT'S

01:34:21.088 --> 01:34:24.992
GOING TO ALLOW. PREDATORS TO

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:27.161
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR YOUTH.

01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:27.928
AND LIKE I SAID AT THE

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.363
BEGINNING THERE'S A LOT THAT WE

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:30.431
NEED TO DO AND A LOT OF

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:31.365
DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF OUR

01:34:31.432 --> 01:34:35.302
SOCIETY WE DO NEED TO DO BETTER.

01:34:35.369 --> 01:34:37.271
BUT THIS BILL. IS ABOUT

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:38.639
PROFILING AND WE'VE ALREADY

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:39.840
STATED ON THIS FLOOR THAT THIS

01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:42.109
IS NOT A STATE. THAT IS GOING

01:34:42.176 --> 01:34:43.978
TO PROFILE SOMEBODY. BASED ON

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:45.946
THEIR RACE. THEIR GENDER THEIR

01:34:46.013 --> 01:34:48.883

AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE WE

EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT IT HAS

WHICH IS WHY I HAVE BEEN CITED

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.585
ON THE FLOOR. THE UNINTENDED

01:36:31.652 --> 01:36:33.888

WANT TO CLEAR A COUPLE THINGS

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:21.302
THAT BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:22.903
WERE SAID THAT ARE. PATENTLY

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.339
FALSE ONE OF WHICH WAS THE

01:37:25.406 --> 01:37:28.409
FOCUS ON CHILD TRAFFICKING AS

01:37:28.475 --> 01:37:29.543
MY COLLEAGUE MEL GROVE ACTUALLY

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:31.145
POINTED OUT THAT WAS

01:37:31.212 --> 01:37:33.514
DECRIMINALIZE THE LOITERING FOR

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:34.481

MINORS WITH DECRIMINALIZED IN

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.954
SB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO AND

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:40.588
TWENTY SIXTEEN THE BILL CARRIED

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:43.624
BY. SENATOR MITCHELL THAT MY

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:44.592
COLLEAGUE FROM PALM DOES IN

01:37:44.658 --> 01:37:47.394
FACT A CO AUTHOR ON SO IF YOU

01:37:47.461 --> 01:37:49.330
BELIEVE THIS IS THAT LOITERING

01:37:49.396 --> 01:37:50.564
FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSTITUTION

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:52.600
IS A TOOL NEEDED TO END CHILD

01:37:52.666 --> 01:37:55.069
TRAFFICKING WELL YOU SHOULD

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:55.703
TALK TO WHOEVER THE LEGISLATURE

01:37:55.769 --> 01:37:57.338
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. BECAUSE THAT

01:37:57.404 --> 01:37:59.540
WAS DONE IN THIS BILL RELATES

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.242
TO PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF

01:38:01.308 --> 01:38:01.976
EIGHTEEN SO I TRY TO BE REALLY

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.577
CLEAR ABOUT THAT ABOUT WHAT THE

01:38:03.644 --> 01:38:06.013
LAW DOES TODAY AND WHAT THIS

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.715
LAW WILL CHANGE BECAUSE I THINK

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:08.382
THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:38:08.449 --> 01:38:11.051
MISSTATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT

01:38:11.118 --> 01:38:11.619
WERE MADE IN THESE DEBATES.

01:38:11.685 --> 01:38:13.887
SECONDLY MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:38:13.954 --> 01:38:16.523
FRESNO CALLED THIS A TOOL USE

01:38:16.590 --> 01:38:18.626
THE WORD TOOL MANY TIMES IT'S A

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:19.827
REALLY NICE WORD FOR

01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:23.097
CRIMINALIZING VICTIMS IT IS NOT

01:38:23.163 --> 01:38:25.733
JUST A TOOL MEMBERS THIS IS A

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:28.736
CRIME. AND I WANT US TO CALL IT

01:38:28.802 --> 01:38:30.604
WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS. SO IF YOU

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:35.142
BELIEVE. THAT FULL HER LAWYER

01:38:35.209 --> 01:38:37.444
DURING SHOULD BE CONVICTED OF A

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:41.248
CRIME. THEN DO WHAT YOU GOTTA

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:43.317
DO BUT IT'S NOT A TOOL IT'S A

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:45.085
CRIME AND THESE PEOPLE END UP

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.553
WITH A RECORD THAT WILL STOP

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:47.588
THEM FROM GETTING HOUSING AND

01:38:47.655 --> 01:38:51.158
JOBS IN THE FUTURE THEY DESERVE.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.826
AND SO I WANTED TO BE VERY

01:38:52.893 --> 01:38:55.329
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THIS IS. AS A

01:38:55.396 --> 01:38:57.531
BODY WE PASSED A HUNDRED AND

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:59.066
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN AID

01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:01.335
FOR VICTIMS. SO WHICH GOES TO

01:39:01.402 --> 01:39:04.772
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS WE-

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:06.106
AS A BODY BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:39:06.173 --> 01:39:08.008
AISLE BELIEVE DEEPLY AND MY

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:09.476
COLLEAGUE FROM ELK GROVE SPOKE

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:10.911
ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS THAT

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.113
MAYBE WE SHOULD DISCUSS DOING

01:39:13.180 --> 01:39:13.847
DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HUMAN

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:15.683
TRAFFICKING WE ALL WANT TO END

01:39:15.749 --> 01:39:17.017

01:39:17.084 --> 01:39:18.752
SINGLE ONE OF US. IS IN

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:19.687
PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:20.587
ENFORCEMENT WHO SAYS WE'RE

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:21.622
LOSING THE WAR ON HUMAN

01:39:21.689 --> 01:39:24.491
TRAFFICKING BUT CAST LA WHICH

01:39:24.558 --> 01:39:26.794
IS THE STRONGEST ADVOCATE FOR

01:39:26.860 --> 01:39:28.629
HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS

01:39:28.696 --> 01:39:30.931
SUPPORTS THIS LEGISLATION. AND

01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:32.800
SO WHEN THE QUESTION WAS RAISED

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:35.102
ABOUT. WHAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:37.304
SAFER I GUESS THE QUESTION IS

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:39.173
WHICH COMMUNITIES DO CARE ABOUT.

01:39:39.239 --> 01:39:41.208
AND THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IS NOT

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:42.109

SPEAKER JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO

04:00:59.912 --> 04:01:00.946
POINT OUT AS YOU DELIBERATE

04:01:01.013 --> 04:01:02.981
THIS BILL SOUNDS LIKE A FAIRLY

04:01:03.048 --> 04:01:05.851
TECHNICAL INNOCUOUS EXTENSION

04:01:05.918 --> 04:01:07.653
OF A LAW BUT IT GOES A LOT

04:01:07.719 --> 04:01:10.022
DEEPER THAN THAT. FOR ONE THING

04:01:10.088 --> 04:01:11.423
IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND MOST

04:01:11.490 --> 04:01:15.727
PEOPLE. A MAJORITY I WOULD SAY-

04:01:15.794 --> 04:01:17.529
THAT ARE CONVICTED OF VOLUNTARY

04:01:17.596 --> 04:01:19.331
MANSLAUGHTER DONE SO AFTER PLEA

04:01:19.398 --> 04:01:20.165
AGREEMENT THEY'RE CHARGED WITH

04:01:20.232 --> 04:01:22.167
MURDER AND THE EVIDENCE IS

04:01:22.234 --> 04:01:23.969
SHAKY MAYBE ON THE MURDER OR

04:01:24.036 --> 04:01:26.004
MAYBE THERE ARE YOUNG OR MAYBE

04:01:26.071 --> 04:01:27.272
THERE ARE MITIGATING

04:01:27.339 --> 04:01:29.441
CIRCUMSTANCES OR MAYBE. THEY

04:01:29.508 --> 04:01:31.743
DON'THAVE A RECORD AND THE

04:01:31.810 --> 04:01:33.478
DA'S OFFICE OFFERS THEM A PLEA

04:01:33.545 --> 04:01:35.113
BARGAIN WHERE THEY PLEA TO

04:01:35.180 --> 04:01:36.815
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. THE

04:01:36.882 --> 04:01:38.016
PENALTIES ON THESE TWO CRIMES

04:01:38.083 --> 04:01:41.620
ARE MUCH DIFFERENT. MURDER ONCE

04:01:41.687 --> 04:01:42.221
TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE MURDER TO

04:01:42.287 --> 04:01:43.689
FIFTEEN TO LIFE. VOLUNTARY

04:01:43.755 --> 04:01:47.059
MANSLAUGHTER IT'S THREE SIX OR

04:01:47.125 --> 04:01:49.194
ELEVEN YEARS SO YOU CAN SEE WHY

04:01:49.261 --> 04:01:49.962
THAT BE PRETTY ENTICING TO A

04:01:50.028 --> 04:01:52.297
DEFENDANT FACING THE POTENTIAL

04:01:52.364 --> 04:01:53.298
FIFTEEN OR TWENTY FIVE TO LIFE

04:01:53.365 --> 04:01:54.933
TO TAKE THAT DEAL SO THEY TAKE

04:01:55.000 --> 04:01:57.102
THAT DEAL AND THAT'S THE DEAL

04:01:57.169 --> 04:01:58.704
THEY MADE WITH THE PEOPLE THE

04:01:58.770 --> 04:02:00.439
PEOPLE'S REPRESENTED THE

04:02:00.505 --> 04:02:00.939
PEOPLE. OF THE STATE OF

04:02:01.006 --> 04:02:03.308
CALIFORNIA. NOW WE'RE COMING

04:02:03.375 --> 04:02:05.010
ALONG AND SAYING. WELL YOU GET

04:02:05.077 --> 04:02:06.144
TO READ BE RESENTENCED WELL

04:02:06.211 --> 04:02:09.348
OKAY. BUT IT ALSO SAYS THAT THE

04:02:09.414 --> 04:02:10.549
JUDGE HAS TO LOOK AT EVIDENCE

04:02:10.616 --> 04:02:11.650
AND IT EXCLUDES HEARSAY

04:02:11.717 --> 04:02:14.086
EVIDENCE PUT ON A PRELIM.

04:02:14.152 --> 04:02:14.686
PRELIMS ARE ALL DONE WITH YOUR

04:02:14.753 --> 04:02:17.489
SENTENCE. PLEA DEALS DON'T EVEN

04:02:17.556 --> 04:02:19.524
SOMETIMES HAVE PRELIMS. SO

04:02:19.591 --> 04:02:20.893
YOU'VE GOT NO RECORD THERE'S

04:02:20.959 --> 04:02:22.127
NOTHING TO LOOK AT FOR THESE

04:02:22.194 --> 04:02:24.630
RESENTENCING. WHICH MEANS

04:02:24.696 --> 04:02:25.864
THEY'RE BASICALLY GOING TO BE

04:02:25.931 --> 04:02:28.200
RUBBER STAMPED BY THE COURTS.

04:02:28.267 --> 04:02:29.968
SO PEOPLE THAT WERE CHARGED

04:02:30.035 --> 04:02:30.535
ORIGINALLY WITH MURDER GOOD

04:02:30.602 --> 04:02:33.038
CHUNK OF THEM. THAT TOOK A DEAL

04:02:33.105 --> 04:02:35.007
THAT THEY MADE WITH THE STATE

04:02:35.073 --> 04:02:37.409
ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE.

04:02:37.476 --> 04:02:39.711
GET A SEVERE REDUCTION SIMPLY

04:02:39.778 --> 04:02:41.546
BECAUSE OF A LACK OF EVIDENCE.

04:02:41.613 --> 04:02:44.483
THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM. THAT'S A

04:02:44.549 --> 04:02:46.518
BIG PROBLEM TURNS JUSTICE.

04:02:46.585 --> 04:02:47.819
BECAUSE JUSTICE HAS DIFFERENT

04:02:47.886 --> 04:02:49.688
SIDES THERE'S JUSTICE FOR THE

04:02:49.755 --> 04:02:51.990
ACCUSED THERE'S DUE PROCESS FOR

04:02:52.057 --> 04:02:53.959
THE ACCUSER JUSTICE FOR THE

04:02:54.026 --> 04:02:54.960
VICTIMS AND THE VICTIMS FAMILY

04:02:55.027 --> 04:02:57.195
TO. THE LAW HAS ALWAYS TREATED

04:02:57.262 --> 04:02:58.697
ATTEMPTED MURDER AND MURDER

04:02:58.764 --> 04:03:01.166
SERIOUSLY ALWAYS. FOR TENS OF

04:03:01.233 --> 04:03:02.434
THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF PRE

04:03:02.501 --> 04:03:05.370
RECORDED HISTORY AND THOUSANDS

04:03:05.437 --> 04:03:05.904
AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF

04:03:05.971 --> 04:03:09.241
RECORDED HISTORY. MANKIND

04:03:09.308 --> 04:03:12.144
KILLED EACH OTHER INTENTIONALLY.

04:03:12.210 --> 04:03:12.744
READ SOME HISTORY IT'S PRETTY

04:03:12.811 --> 04:03:15.881
UGLY. THAT'S WHY EVERY

04:03:15.948 --> 04:03:18.016
CIVILIZED SOCIETY SAYS MURDER

04:03:18.083 --> 04:03:18.917
IS GOING TO BE TREATED

04:03:18.984 --> 04:03:19.818
DIFFERENTLY THAN EVERYTHING

04:03:19.885 --> 04:03:22.387
ELSE BECAUSE IT IS A CRIME FOR

04:03:22.454 --> 04:03:24.890
WHICH YOU CANNOT UNDO THE HARM.

04:03:24.957 --> 04:03:26.024
NO NOT A COUNSELING FIXES

04:03:26.091 --> 04:03:27.192
MURDER. NO MATTER

04:03:27.259 --> 04:03:29.328
REHABILITATION FIXES A LIFE

04:03:29.394 --> 04:03:30.996
THAT YOU SNUFFED OUT. AN

04:03:31.063 --> 04:03:32.431
INNOCENT LIFE THAT YOU TOOK

04:03:32.497 --> 04:03:34.366
WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. THE

04:03:34.433 --> 04:03:37.202
CHANGES FAMILIES. WRECKS LIVES

04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:38.503
THAT'S WHY THE LAW HAS ALWAYS

COLLEAGUE FROM SAN LUIS OBISPO

FOR HIS REMARKS I JUST WANNA

04:06:48.760 --> 04:06:49.494
MAKE A CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHAT

04:06:49.561 --> 04:06:52.564
THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO

04:06:52.631 --> 04:06:55.033
THIS BILL IS ABOUT THOSE WHO

04:06:55.100 --> 04:06:57.302
WERE CHARGED AND CONVICTED

04:06:57.369 --> 04:06:59.204
UNDER THE FELONY MURDER RULE.

04:06:59.271 --> 04:07:00.272
THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN AIDING

04:07:00.338 --> 04:07:01.773
AND ABETTING MURDER WHICH WILL

04:07:01.840 --> 04:07:03.175
STILL REMAIN ON THE BOOKS AFTER

04:07:03.241 --> 04:07:05.810
THIS BILL PASSES THIS IS PEOPLE

04:07:05.877 --> 04:07:06.678
WHO DO NOT INTEND FOR MURDER TO

04:07:06.745 --> 04:07:08.847
OCCUR AND THEY ARE BEING

04:07:08.914 --> 04:07:09.581
CHARGED WITH THE MURDER OF

04:07:09.648 --> 04:07:12.250
ANOTHER WELL WE'RE YOU YOU I

04:07:12.317 --> 04:07:13.685
WAS NOT HERE AT THE TIME BUT

04:07:13.752 --> 04:07:15.820
THIS HOUSE RT SAID THAT THEY

04:07:15.887 --> 04:07:16.855
CANNOT BE CHARGED WITH THE

04:07:16.922 --> 04:07:18.557
MURDER COMMITTED BY ANOTHER.

04:07:18.623 --> 04:07:19.658
BUT IF IT IS A MANSLAUGHTER

04:07:19.724 --> 04:07:21.226
CHARGE THEY CAN STILLBE

04:07:21.293 --> 04:07:22.661
CHARGED EVEN IF THEY DROVE UP

04:07:22.727 --> 04:07:23.728
THINKING ALL THAT WAS GONNA

04:07:23.795 --> 04:07:28.767
HAPPEN WAS SOME CRIME MUCH LESS.

04:07:28.833 --> 04:07:30.635
THEN WHAT OCCURRED DURING THE

04:07:30.702 --> 04:07:31.903
INCIDENT AND NOW THEY'RE BEING

04:07:31.970 --> 04:07:33.505
CHARGED THE CRIME OF ANOTHER.

04:07:33.572 --> 04:07:35.473
AND I THINK WHAT. THE QUESTION

04:07:35.540 --> 04:07:37.242
THAT IS BEFORE THIS HOUSE TODAY

04:07:37.309 --> 04:07:38.743
AND WAS BEFORE THIS HOUSE. WHEN

04:07:38.810 --> 04:07:39.945
SENATOR SKINNER BROUGHT HER

04:07:40.011 --> 04:07:42.647
BILL YEARS AGO WAS. WHERE

04:07:42.714 --> 04:07:44.783
SHOULD THE CULPABILITY LIFE.

04:07:44.849 --> 04:07:45.984
THE PERSON WHO PULLS THE

04:07:46.051 --> 04:07:47.686
TRIGGER COMMITTED MURDER

04:07:47.752 --> 04:07:48.653
COMMITTED MANSLAUGHTER WHATEVER

04:07:48.720 --> 04:07:49.821
THE CRIME IS THAT WAS

04:07:49.888 --> 04:07:51.990
COMMITTED. AND THEY WILL SERVE

04:07:52.057 --> 04:07:55.727
THE TIME IF ENABLE PROSECUTOR.

04:07:55.794 --> 04:07:56.861
PROVES GUILT BEYOND A

04:07:56.928 --> 04:07:59.497
REASONABLE DOUBT BUT- ARE YOU

04:07:59.564 --> 04:08:01.933
GUILTY FOR THAT ACT IF YOU WERE

04:08:02.000 --> 04:08:03.902
NOT THE ONE WHO COMMITTED IT.

04:08:03.969 --> 04:08:05.904
AND IF THAT ACTS RIGHT NOW IS

04:08:05.971 --> 04:08:08.773
MANSLAUGHTER LOSSES YES. AND I

04:08:08.840 --> 04:08:09.307
THINK THAT'S THE QUESTION

04:08:09.374 --> 04:08:10.775
BEFORE THE HOUSE AND I BELIEVE

04:08:10.842 --> 04:08:12.143
THAT MANY OF US BELIEVE JUSTICE

04:08:12.210 --> 04:08:13.345

THAT WE SHOULD SERVE THE TIME

04:08:19.384 --> 04:08:20.819
AND I GET AWAY DRIVER WILL

04:08:20.885 --> 04:08:22.988
SERVE TIME FOR CRIME BUT NOT

04:08:23.054 --> 04:08:24.823
THE CRIME COMMITTED BY ANOTHER.

04:08:24.889 --> 04:08:26.091
THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS JUSTICE

04:08:26.157 --> 04:08:27.459
MEAN AND EVERY VICTIM DESERVES

04:08:27.525 --> 04:08:28.960
JUSTICE. AND THE PERSON WHO

04:08:29.027 --> 04:08:30.762
PULLED THAT TRIGGER WILL SERVE.

04:08:30.829 --> 04:08:31.730

SOMETHING LIKE THAT EVER. EVER

08:57:24.178 --> 08:57:25.379

EVER SEEN THAT. PARTICULAR

08:57:32.720 --> 08:57:33.621
REPORT FROM SOMEONE FROM A

08:57:33.688 --> 08:57:35.556
VICTIM A KID THIS HAS HAPPENED

TO THE WAY HOME WALKING HOME.

08:57:37.358 --> 08:57:38.993
THAT'S NOT DAILY BASIS OR

08:57:39.060 --> 08:57:40.795
SOMEONE DOES CRAZY STUFF LIKE

08:57:40.861 --> 08:57:43.164

OTHER THINGS OF COURSE BUT FOR

08:57:48.569 --> 08:57:50.471
SOME REASON WE ALWAYS WANT TO.

08:57:50.538 --> 08:57:52.807
LET EVERYBODY IN THERE. AND IF

08:57:52.873 --> 08:57:56.110
YOUR SEX OFFENDER. OF SOME SORT.

08:57:56.177 --> 08:57:57.378
YOU SHOULD NOT GET A BREAK

08:57:57.445 --> 08:57:59.413
BECAUSE NINETY NINE POINT 9%

THE PUBLIC WILL NEVER EVER DO

08:58:00.715 --> 08:58:02.984
THAT. SO I CAN WHEN I SEE

08:58:03.050 --> 08:58:03.818
PEOPLE STAND UP AND ADVOCATE

08:58:03.884 --> 08:58:05.720

08:58:08.222 --> 08:58:09.223
REALLY NO GOOD REASON WE MAKE

08:58:09.290 --> 08:58:10.925
OURSELVES. LOOK SILLY IN THE

08:58:10.992 --> 08:58:11.993
PUBLIC AND YOU ASK THEM OUT

08:58:12.059 --> 08:58:13.127
THERE LIKE THAT THAT WE BELIEVE

08:58:13.194 --> 08:58:14.895
IN SECOND CHANCES REDEMPTION.

08:58:14.962 --> 08:58:17.098

SIXTEEN CRIMES I MEAN YOU KNOW

08:58:29.710 --> 08:58:31.245
IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT

08:58:31.312 --> 08:58:33.681
