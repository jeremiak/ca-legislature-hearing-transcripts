PERSON INSTRUCTION SO IT'S

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:00.312
POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE A

00:18:00.379 --> 00:18:02.748
HYBRID APPROACH WHERE. STUDENTS

00:18:02.815 --> 00:18:03.816
ARE IN THE CLASSROOM FOR

00:18:03.882 --> 00:18:05.217

STUDENTS NEED AND SOME OF THAT

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:20.065
MAY JUST. REALLY DEPEND ON HOW

00:18:20.132 --> 00:18:22.868
THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:23.335
ALLEYS TO FIND- HOW TO

00:18:23.402 --> 00:18:27.039
IMPLEMENT THAT. IS THIS NOT

THAT- FOR FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.854
TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO NON

00:19:15.921 --> 00:19:17.823

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:19.258
THEY DO SO- WITH THE

00:19:19.324 --> 00:19:21.760
UNDERSTANDING THAT- MUCH IF NOT

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:22.861

A DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL SO

00:19:28.267 --> 00:19:30.435
THERE'S NOT AS MUCH- CONCERNED

00:19:30.502 --> 00:19:31.937
ABOUT BRINGING KIDS BACK INTO

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:32.504
THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE IT'S

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:33.639
SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN

00:19:33.705 --> 00:19:34.706
THAT THE DISTANCE DURING PEAK

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.008
SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN.

00:19:36.074 --> 00:19:37.142
HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT ALL

00:19:37.209 --> 00:19:38.877
OTHER CHARTER SCHOOL CLASSMATES

00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:40.779

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:11.410
CONCERN- ABOUT ONE SECOND

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:12.945
CENTER GROVE YOU'RE MIKE

00:20:13.011 --> 00:20:15.180

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:18.784
BETTER HY HOLD THAT POLICY

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.619

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY I'M

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.989
CALLING FROM T. HE MET- ASK THE

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.757
QUESTIONS THAT I WAS- SEEKING

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.160
ANSWERS AND RESPONSES TO. ABOUT

00:20:28.226 --> 00:20:29.995
CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ABOUT THE

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.229
DISTANCE LEARNING ISSUE THAT WE

00:20:31.296 --> 00:20:33.065
HAVE ON THE HYBRID PROGRAM. I

00:20:33.131 --> 00:20:34.333
DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THIS

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:36.301
BILL HAS A LARGE FOCUS ON THE

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.337
HYBRID PROGRAM WHERE. THE MONEY

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:39.605
WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE

00:20:39.671 --> 00:20:40.973
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR LOCAL

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.708
COMMUNITIES EVEN IF THEY JUST

00:20:42.774 --> 00:20:44.476
OPENED UP ONE DAY A WEEK. I

00:20:44.543 --> 00:20:46.044
DON'T THINK THAT- OPENING ONE

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.980
DAY A WEEK IS WHAT OUR PARENTS

00:20:48.046 --> 00:20:49.548
ARE LOOKING FOR. IN THE

00:20:49.615 --> 00:20:52.384
EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN- AND

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.019
I THINK THAT- THERE SHOULD BE

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:55.554
SOME TYPE OF ADDITION TO THIS

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:56.822
LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.190
SCHOOLS TO OPEN. IN A

00:20:58.256 --> 00:20:59.524
CONSISTENT MANNER SO THAT

00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:00.192
PARENTS CAN HAVE THE

00:21:00.258 --> 00:21:01.326
OPPORTUNITY HAVE THEIR CHILDREN

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:03.362
EDUCATED. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.097
SYSTEM A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN

00:21:05.163 --> 00:21:07.532
MY COMMUNITY. CANNOT US AFFORD

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:09.067
TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN IN AN

00:21:09.134 --> 00:21:11.203
EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS-

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:12.504
PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:21:12.571 --> 00:21:13.372
PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:14.806
EDUCATION THEIR CHILDREN HAVE

00:21:14.873 --> 00:21:16.508
NOT MISS THIS ONE YEAR

00:21:16.575 --> 00:21:17.509
ANNIVERSARY THIS ONE YEAR GAP

00:21:17.576 --> 00:21:21.546
IN- IN EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT.

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.248
AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AND

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:24.850
EXCLUDED FROM IN PERSON

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.618
LEARNING. AND THAT'S NOT THE

00:21:26.685 --> 00:21:28.687
CASE IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A

00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:29.821
LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:30.822
MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:32.024
NEEDS PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO BE

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.426
OPEN. AND I THINK- ALTHOUGH

00:21:34.493 --> 00:21:36.695
THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:39.598
INCENTIVIZE SCHOOLS. MY CONCERN

00:21:39.665 --> 00:21:43.135
IS THAT- THE SCHOOLS WILL ONLY

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:44.636
OPEN ONE DAY A WEEK AND THAT

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:46.204
STILL PRESENT PRESENTS A MAJOR

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.406
PROBLEM IN EDUCATION FOR THE

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:51.143
MAJORITY. OF OUR STUDENTS IN

00:21:51.209 --> 00:21:55.113
THIS STATE. I GUESS MY QUESTION

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.149
IS THAT- IS THERE TO BE ANY

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:58.550
DISCUSSION OR MOVING FORWARD IN

00:21:58.617 --> 00:21:59.851
NEGOTIATIONS ON THE HYBRID

00:21:59.918 --> 00:22:03.922
LEARNING PROGRAM. HI SENATOR

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:04.923
ERICA LEE AGAIN WITH THE

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.625
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I

00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:08.593
THINK THE ONE THING- YOU KNOW

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:09.928
THERE'S THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES

00:22:09.995 --> 00:22:11.697
IS A LOT OF LCAL DISCRETION

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:13.465
AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT A MANDATE

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:14.566
BUT FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:17.602
ARE- IN RECEIPT OF FINES. THERE

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:19.638
NEEDS TO BE A PLAN FOR IN

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:21.339
PERSON INSTRUCTION AND AGAIN

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:22.407
THE STATE DOESN'T DICTATE WHAT

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.676
THAT PLAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE- AND

00:22:24.743 --> 00:22:26.912
IT IS REALLY UP TO BE

00:22:26.978 --> 00:22:27.646
ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:30.449
PARENTS- IN IN THOSE LOCAL.

00:22:30.515 --> 00:22:32.017
SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DECIDE WHAT

00:22:32.084 --> 00:22:34.686
THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM WITH

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:35.587
THE BEST MODEL IS FOR THEM.

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:41.927

THE PURPLE TEAR- DEPENDING ON

CASE RATES- SCHOOLS- THAT ARE

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:42.180

POPULATIONS THAT I MENTIONED

BEFORE SUCH AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:57.662
LEARNERS- STUDENTS THAT ARE

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:58.363
HOMELESS STUDENTS IN FOSTER

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.999
CARE CENTER- AND SO. THOSE

00:25:01.066 --> 00:25:03.501
SCHOOLS IN PURPLE TEARS HAVE

00:25:03.568 --> 00:25:08.440
THE- THEY THEY MUST PROVIDE. IN

00:25:08.506 --> 00:25:10.208
PERSON INSTRUCTION TO AT LEAST

00:25:10.275 --> 00:25:12.410
THOSE GROUPS AND MANY OF THOSE

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:13.378
INDIVIDUALS I THINK ARE THE

00:25:13.445 --> 00:25:14.212
ONES THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:18.750
CENTER SENATOR- IN REGARDS TO-

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.352
CASE RATES AS CASE RATES GO

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:23.355
DOWN. SCHOOLS MUST OFFER- IN

00:25:23.421 --> 00:25:25.523
PERSON INSTRUCTION THROUGH THAT

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.224
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

00:25:26.291 --> 00:25:28.426
THROUGH SECOND GRADE- AND SO

00:25:28.493 --> 00:25:29.461
AGAIN THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CASE

00:25:29.527 --> 00:25:34.032
RATES- BETWEEN SEVEN AND TWENTY

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:37.168
FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND-

00:25:37.235 --> 00:25:40.038
IN TERMS OF THE- LEARNING LIVES

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:41.273
THROUGH WE HAVE THE FOUR POINT

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:42.841
SIX BILLION AND I WANT TO JUST

00:25:42.908 --> 00:25:43.975
POINT OUT THAT IN BOTH CASES

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.143
THE TWO BILLION AND THE FOUR

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.044
POINT SIX BILLION WOULD BE

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:48.146
ALLOCATED BASED ON- THE LOCAL

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:49.514
CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH

00:25:49.581 --> 00:25:55.120
IS- OBVIOUSLY- HEAVILY-

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:58.423
FORMULATED SO THAT- IT BENEFITS

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:01.660
THE LOWEST INCOME- ELEAZAR. AND

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:03.395
SO AGAIN YOU HAVE- THAT

00:26:03.461 --> 00:26:07.065
POPULATION I THINK IS- THE ONE

00:26:07.132 --> 00:26:07.666
THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:08.500
REGARDS TO LA. BUT JUST IN

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:09.701
TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION IT

00:26:09.768 --> 00:26:12.904
IS- BASED ON- IT'S AN EQUITY

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.673
BASED DISTRIBUTION BASED ON LC

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:17.676
ABOUT FORMULA. AND THOSE FUNDS

00:26:17.742 --> 00:26:19.377
WOULD BE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.746
NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THOSE

00:26:21.813 --> 00:26:23.748
AREAS THAT ARE LOW INCOME- AND

00:26:23.815 --> 00:26:26.117
I DON'T KNOW IF I JESSICA IF

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:26.718
YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:48.673
TO THAT. THE FIRM. THE I. T.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.208
SHE'S TURNING ANSWERED WHEN I

00:26:50.275 --> 00:26:51.643
HEARD BACK OKAY GREAT YOUR MUTE

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:53.411
CAN YOU GO AHEAD YES PLEASE

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.680
PROCEED YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.415
THAT I WAS ON MUTE AND DEAF

00:26:57.482 --> 00:26:58.850
HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:00.185
SENATOR OUT THAT YOU BRING UP

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:03.722
AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE AND WE

00:27:03.788 --> 00:27:05.557
HAVE HEARD SIGNIFICANT AND

00:27:05.623 --> 00:27:07.525
FEEDBACK FROM FAMILY ABOUT THAT

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:10.128
AND THERE IS THERE IS A TENSION

00:27:10.195 --> 00:27:12.063
BETWEEN WANTING THAT MAKE SURE

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.365
THE KIDS ARE BACK IN SCHOOL BUT

00:27:13.431 --> 00:27:14.399
ALSO A LOT OF CONCERN

00:27:14.466 --> 00:27:16.167
ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT

00:27:16.234 --> 00:27:17.235
HAVE BEEN SEVERELY HARD HIT BY

00:27:17.302 --> 00:27:19.804
CODY NINETEEN- THAT YOU KNOW

00:27:19.871 --> 00:27:20.405
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND THEIR

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:25.243
KIDS BACK- IF. THERE'S A RISK

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.844
OF INFECTION. AND SO I THINK

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:26.378
WHAT YOU'RE WHAT WHAT ARE

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:28.313
PROPOSAL. THAT REALLY TRIED TO

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.182
BALANCE- BOTH THE CONCERN OF

00:27:31.249 --> 00:27:32.150
HIM LEADS AND TRYING TO

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:33.785
ENCOURAGE THEM TO FEEL SAFE AND

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.253
GETTING THEIR KIDS BACK. BUT

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.087
ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:37.489
OPTIONS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND

00:27:37.555 --> 00:27:38.857
THAT THAT'S INCREDIBLY

00:27:38.923 --> 00:27:39.557
IMPORTANT DURING A TIME LIKE

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:42.093
THIS. SO WHILE THE TWO BILLION

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.729
REQUIRES AT LEAST OFFER- IN

00:27:44.796 --> 00:27:45.997
PERSON INSTRUCTION IT DOESN'T

00:27:46.064 --> 00:27:48.033
REQUIRE FAMILIES TO ACCEPT THAT

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:49.934
IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IF THEY

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:50.802
FEEL LIKE THE DISTANCE LEARNING

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:53.638
MODEL IS A BETTER FIT FOR THEN-

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:55.206
IN ADDITION TO FOUR POINT SIX

00:27:55.273 --> 00:27:57.442
BILLION ALLOW UP TO. 15% OF

00:27:57.509 --> 00:27:59.077
THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED TO

00:27:59.144 --> 00:28:00.078
SUPPORT AND ENHANCE DISTANCE

00:28:00.145 --> 00:28:01.746
LEARNING. THAT BOTH BOTH YOU

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:03.448
NEED TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:04.015
DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL CAN

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.683
ALSO RECEIVE. AN IMPROVED

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:07.285
SERVICE HOLD SO THAT THE OTHER

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:08.286
TWO I THINK VERY IMPORTANT

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.822
POINTS THERE I THINK- IT

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:11.756
FINALLY I THINK ONE OF THE

00:28:11.823 --> 00:28:12.524
REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:14.426
THE FOUR POINT SIX MILLION. IS

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:15.960
THAT THERE'S A REAL FOCUS ON

00:28:16.027 --> 00:28:16.761
EXPANDING LEARNING TIME WE

00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:18.663
RECOGNIZE THAT. STUDENTS MAY

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:21.032
NOT HAVE RECEIVED- AS MUCH- IN

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:22.934
PERSON OR OR AND YOUR CRITICS

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:25.136

AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:28:26.237 --> 00:28:27.505
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:29.574
THAT TO BE MADE UP. ON BOTH IN

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:30.341
THE CURRENT YEAR BUT ALSO IN

00:28:30.408 --> 00:28:32.343
THE NEXT. COUPLE YEARS WELL SO

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:33.611
THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.146
THAT IS FILE ANYTHING JUST TO

00:28:35.213 --> 00:28:36.548
KIND OF SPEAK TO THE OTHER

00:28:36.614 --> 00:28:37.782
MEMBERS QUESTION CAN HELP KIN

CIRCLE YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:28:40.952 --> 00:28:42.020
PURPOSE AROUND INCLUDING THE

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.455
HYBRID MODEL WAS TO ENSURE

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:45.623
THAT- SOME SCHOOLS WHO HAVE

DISTANCING IN PLACE- AND THAT

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.311
AND THE COMING NEXT

THAT WAS CREATED BY THE STATE

00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:46.591
BY WALKING SCHOOLS DOWNPOUR

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:49.026

APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BUT FROM

00:34:33.938 --> 00:34:37.375
MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS LOOKS LIKE.

00:34:37.442 --> 00:34:39.110
NOT IN NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE

00:34:39.177 --> 00:34:40.411
LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:34:40.478 --> 00:34:42.180
OFFICE BUT IN HOSTAGE

00:34:42.246 --> 00:34:44.582
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CTA

00:34:44.649 --> 00:34:45.082
AND THE GOVERNOR AND IT

00:34:45.149 --> 00:34:48.786
APPEARS. THE CTA'S WINNING-

00:34:48.853 --> 00:34:51.556
SEVERAL ARE. THIS IS NOT THE

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.691
BILL THAT I WAS EXPECTING THIS

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.760
BILL DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:58.162
THIS BILL IS. DEPRESSING TO BE

00:34:58.229 --> 00:35:01.165

GENERAL WHO ARE HERE FROM ALL

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:08.940
THE TIME I DON'T THINK THIS

00:35:09.006 --> 00:35:11.609
BILL. DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.244
IT SHOULD BE REQUIRING THAT

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:17.815
SCHOOLS OPEN- BUT IT DOES NOT-

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:21.385

TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AFFECT

00:40:20.384 --> 00:40:22.153
THE ELECTOR SCHOOL BOARDS

MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS- FOR

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:28.159
SCHOOLS LOCALLY AND FACT HERE'S

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.995
A LEGISLATURE WE'VE- ALSO.

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:34.131
TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO. DIFFER

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:37.001
MORE TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS

00:40:37.067 --> 00:40:42.773
TO- AND- TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:44.341
AFFECT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT-

00:40:44.408 --> 00:40:44.875
YOU KNOW ARMED FORCES- OUR

00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:45.943
PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES HAVE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.278
BEEN SOMEWHAT AND EVEN IN THE

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:49.413
STATE AND- THEY'RE SOMEWHAT

00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:51.982
UNEVEN BECAUSE THE STATE HAS

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:54.185
NOT AND- YOU KNOW I. PERSONALLY

00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:55.586
I THINK WE PERHAPS SHOULD DONE

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:56.854
MORE BUT I THINK SOME OF MY

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:57.655
COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD I WOULD

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:59.690
OBJECTED. IF THE STATE WAS

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:02.326
MORE. HEAVY HANDED IN TRYING TO

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.561
ENFORCE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.895
AND THEN WE HAVE BEEN AS A

00:41:04.962 --> 00:41:06.764
STATE AND INSTEAD DEFERRED MORE

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:10.134
TWO. COUNTIES AND- INCLUDING-

00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.735
LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO

00:41:11.802 --> 00:41:14.538
THAT OR NOT TO ENFORCE AND IN

00:41:14.605 --> 00:41:18.275
FACT- THAT UNEVEN ENFORCEMENT

00:41:18.342 --> 00:41:20.244
IS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO. A LONG

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.579
BLOCK YOU KNOW FOR SO LONG AND-

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:23.280
ISOLATION AND SOME OF THE

00:41:23.347 --> 00:41:24.448
EFFECTS THAT PEOPLE REFERENCE

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:27.885
SO I THINK THAT- IS INTERESTING

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.320
THAT PEOPLE ARE OBJECTING TO

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.487
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:30.554 --> 00:41:32.423
NOT CLOSE ORDERING OR FORCING

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:35.960

WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY- PERHAPS

00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.871
PREVENTED DEATHS AND- AND- MORE

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:49.773

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:17.987
THERE IS GENERALLY KNOWLEDGE

00:59:18.054 --> 00:59:20.556
MEANT THAT- MANY MANY STUDENTS

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:23.026
ARE. ARE BEHIND IN REGARDS TO

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:25.862
LEARNING AND PART OF THE THAT

00:59:25.929 --> 00:59:27.830
WILL A LARGE CHUNK OF THIS-

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.165
ALLOCATION OF FOUR POINT SIX

00:59:29.232 --> 00:59:31.167
BILLION IS REALLY THERE TO

SUPPORT- THE LEARNING LOSS AND

00:59:35.204 --> 00:59:37.307
TO PREVENT FURTHER- LOSS FROM

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:39.342
OCCURRING- IN REGARDS TO

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:41.711
FUTURE- TESTING AND OR OTHER

00:59:41.778 --> 00:59:44.414
MEANS BY WHICH TO WEIGH WHAT

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.483
THAT LOSS IS- THAT THAT ISN'T.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.685
YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS NOT PART

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:50.019

HELP THEM ADDRESS SOME OF THAT

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:07.737
LEARNING LOSS- IN THE FUTURE IT

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.672
MAY BE NECESSARY FOR TEACHERS

01:00:09.739 --> 01:00:12.208
TO- FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.077

AND THAT THE STATE- THEY BOTH

01:06:49.238 --> 01:06:50.906
ACTUALLY- REVIEWING IT THEY IT

01:06:50.973 --> 01:06:52.908
TAKES ABOUT. FIVE DAYS AND ON

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.176

APPROVED BY THE COUNTY OR BOTH-

01:07:05.554 --> 01:07:06.422
I BELIEVE IT'S BOTH. BUT THE

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:08.023
COUNTY THE STATE. SO BOTH HAVE

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.625
TO BE ANGRY TO. OPEN OUR

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:10.893

ADD THAT- THE STATE- ALONG WITH

01:07:15.765 --> 01:07:18.167
COUNTIES HAVE BEEN IN- MANY

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:20.035
DISCUSSIONS AND- THROUGHOUT

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:21.570
THIS WAS SEVERAL MONTHS SO THIS

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:22.838
WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY

01:07:22.905 --> 01:07:24.106
NEW INFORMATION BUT THERE'D BE

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.074
A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN

01:07:25.141 --> 01:07:27.309
THE LOCAL AND STATE.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:30.079
JURISDICTIONS OKAY. AND THEN

01:07:30.146 --> 01:07:30.813
I'M GOING BACK TO THE

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.214
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST AS A

01:07:32.281 --> 01:07:34.683
FOLLOW UP QUESTION. ON THE

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:39.388
DEFERRALS- IS IT FAIR M. IS

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.524
THIS THE IS SIX POINT SIX

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:43.692
BILLION DOLLARS PARTIALLY

01:07:43.759 --> 01:07:44.193
FUNDED WITH THE CURRENT

01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.697
DEFERRAL. I'M IN THE HOME- AT

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:51.066
ALL REFER THAT QUESTION DID NOT

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:54.437
MISS HOLMES. CERTAINLY SO I

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:55.571
THINK I THINK WHAT YOU'RE

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.039
REFERRING TO IS THE THREE POINT

01:07:57.106 --> 01:07:58.374
SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRAL

01:07:58.441 --> 01:08:01.110
FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND-

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.813
TWENTY TWENTY Q. SCHOOL YEAR-

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:06.215
AND WHILE AND PIZZA AND THE SIX

01:08:06.282 --> 01:08:08.184
POINT SIX BILLION- COULD BE

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.886
USED TO PAY DOWN THAT DEFERRAL

01:08:10.953 --> 01:08:12.488
IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:14.924
YEAR- THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:16.425
AVAILABLE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:18.394
HE COVER THE COST AS THE

01:08:18.461 --> 01:08:20.529
DEFERRAL INTO FUTURE YEARS-

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:24.733
IT'S AN ONGOING DEFERRAL. AND

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.435
YOUR ONE TIME SIGN. OKAY THANK

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:32.141
YOU VERY MUCH. IN SENATOR

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:36.278
LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:38.547
MADAM CHAIR OF WHAT I THOUGHT I

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:42.418
COULD DO HIS- SPEAK AND TRY TO

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:44.653
TIE TOGETHER A LITTLE A LOT OF

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.488
THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.356
THIS DEBATE BECAUSE THE

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:50.593
DISTRICTS THAT WE ALL REPRESENT

01:08:50.659 --> 01:08:52.728
ARE VERY DIFFERENT SENATOR

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:54.997
NIELSEN IS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:56.899
MOST OF THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:57.900
THE LOWEST CASE RIGHT IN THE

01:08:57.967 --> 01:08:59.802
STATE AND AS WE HEARD FROM

01:08:59.869 --> 01:09:02.104
SENATOR GARAGE SO- SHE HAS

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:03.839
AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:07.710
IMPACTED WITH CASES. IN A WAY

01:09:07.776 --> 01:09:08.978
THAT THERE'S A BIG CONCERN

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.546
ABOUT COMING BACK IN IN MY OWN

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:13.549
DISTRICT I HAVE BOTH I HAVE THE

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.217
ABSOLUTE COASTAL AREAS WHERE

01:09:15.284 --> 01:09:16.519
PEOPLE REALLY THINK THAT IT'S

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:18.387
EASY TO COME BACK IN THE CASES

01:09:18.454 --> 01:09:21.056
ARE LOWER AND THE MORE AWAY

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:22.825
FROM THE COAST AGRICULTURAL

01:09:22.892 --> 01:09:23.826
AREAS WHERE THERE'S

01:09:23.893 --> 01:09:25.361
INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:27.029
MUCH MORE DIVERSITY AND THEY

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.597
HAVE MANY MORE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:09:28.664 --> 01:09:30.399
COMING BACK SO THE REAL

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:35.304
QUESTION IS HOW IN ONE BILL DO

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:35.971
WE ADDRESS ALL THIS. AND

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:38.440
SENATOR GROVE. A MADE THE POINT

01:09:38.507 --> 01:09:40.009
THAT SHE REALLY WANTED

01:09:40.075 --> 01:09:42.411
CONSISTENT STANDARDS. AND THERE

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:44.480
ARE CONSISTENT. WITH THE

01:09:44.547 --> 01:09:46.248
CONSISTENT STANDARDS ARE ABOUT

01:09:46.315 --> 01:09:48.217
FLEXIBILITY SO THAT YOU CAN

01:09:48.284 --> 01:09:51.787
ADDRESS THOSE DIFFERENT CASES.

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.656
AND JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:56.192
OCCURS IN A MOMENT I'LL TALK

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:57.092
ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:59.094
GUIDANCE THAT. THAT A SENATOR

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:01.130
PAN MENTIONED BUT LET'S JUST

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:03.632
SAY. YOU HAVE A CLASS ROOM

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.334
WHERE UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:08.270
GUIDANCE. YOU CANNOT HAVE FULL

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.673
ATTENDANCE IN ONE ROOM DUE TO

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:12.241
SOCIAL DISTANCING BECAUSE THE

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:13.709
NUMBER OF KIDS THAT ARE IN THAT

01:10:13.776 --> 01:10:16.946
CLASS. AND SO IN THAT CASE. WE

01:10:17.012 --> 01:10:19.248
WANT TO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY SO

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.183
THAT IF HALF THE KIDS CAN BE

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.185
THERE ONE TIME. AND THE OTHER

01:10:23.252 --> 01:10:24.820
HALF CAN BE DISTANCE LEARNING

01:10:24.887 --> 01:10:26.021
AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE WEEK

01:10:26.088 --> 01:10:28.090
THEY SWITCH. THAT GIVES THE

01:10:28.157 --> 01:10:29.758
DISTRICT THE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.760
BRING HIM BACK IN THE MAXIMUM

01:10:31.827 --> 01:10:34.096
POSSIBLE WAY AGAINST THE PUBLIC

01:10:34.163 --> 01:10:36.899
HEALTH GUIDANCE. AND SO THERE

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:37.900
NEEDS TO BE THAT KIND OF

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.102
FLEXIBILITY SO PEOPLE CAN PUSH

01:10:40.169 --> 01:10:42.905
AS FAR AS THEY CAN WITHIN THE

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:43.706
PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE TO DO

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:46.241
IT. AND I THINK THAT THERE BEEN

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:49.645
QUESTIONS RAISED. ABOUT PUBLIC

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:52.314
HEALTH AND- L. A. TIMES HAD AN

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:54.383
OP ED THAT I DON'T THINK WAS

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.652
EXACTLY ON THE MARK. BECAUSE

01:10:56.719 --> 01:10:58.754
THEY IMPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT.

01:10:58.821 --> 01:11:00.422
THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US WAS

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.726
NOT SCIENCE BASED. IN FACT IT

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:05.995
DOES NOT LEGISLATE THE PUBLIC

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:09.031
HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT IT REQUIRES

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.666
THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AND

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:11.967
LET THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.936
PROFESSIONALS DECIDE WHAT THE

01:11:14.003 --> 01:11:16.805
GUIDANCE IS. THERE WAS DEBT

01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:21.910
EQUAL. INFERENCE IN THAT

01:11:21.977 --> 01:11:23.045
EDITORIAL. THAT THIS BILL RICK.

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.713
VAX BEFORE TEACH CAN BACK TO

01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.249
SCHOOL. AND IT DOES NOT IT

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:30.052
FOLLOWS WHAT THE CDC'S SCIENCE

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:33.155
BASED GUIDANCE IS WHICH IS NOT

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.490
REQUIRED VACCINATIONS FOR

01:11:34.556 --> 01:11:36.392
SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BUT STRONGLY

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.594
RECOMMEND THEM THAT IS EXACTLY

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:40.095
WHAT THIS BILL DOES SO IT'S

01:11:40.162 --> 01:11:41.864
BASED ON SCIENCE AND IT'S

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.932
CONSISTENT WITH THE CDC. AND

01:11:43.999 --> 01:11:46.235
PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID HE

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:49.438
WISHES TO PRIORITIZE TEACHERS

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.272
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:52.508
DOES AS WELL. SO IT IS VERY

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:56.979
CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT. A. N.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.515
ADDITIONALLY. THE EVERY

01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:01.984
DISTRICT IS NOT THE SAME SO

01:12:02.051 --> 01:12:03.385
IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW YOU

01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.521
ADDRESS THE NEEDS IN THOSE

01:12:05.587 --> 01:12:07.423
DISTRICTS AND- AND I THINK WHAT

01:12:07.489 --> 01:12:08.457
SENATOR NIELSEN SOMEBODY

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.259
BROUGHT UP CHARTER SCHOOLS IT

01:12:10.325 --> 01:12:12.127
AND THE ANSWER SHOWED EXACTLY

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:14.196
THAT FLEXIBILITY. THAT IF THEY

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.931
WERE A DISTANCE LEARNING ALL

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:17.900
THE WAY ALONG. WE'RE NOT GOING

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.568
TO PAY THEM TO RE OPEN BECAUSE

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.170
THEY'VE BEEN RE OPENED DOING

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.538
DISTANCE LEARNING ALL THE WAY

01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:25.407
ALONG. THE REAL QUESTION IS IF

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.843
THEY WERE DOING IN PERSON WHAT

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:30.612
INCENSE OR SUPPORTS THEM TO

01:12:30.679 --> 01:12:32.815
COME BACK IN PERSON. AND THE

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.349
REAL CHANGE THAT HAS HAPPENED

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.552
DURING THE COUPLE OF MONTHS.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.320
THIS IS BEEN MORE INTENSELY

01:12:38.387 --> 01:12:42.224
DISCUSSED. IS A CHANGE IN THE

01:12:42.291 --> 01:12:43.058
PANDEMIC. BECAUSE THE TIME

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.294
GOVERNOR CRAFTED A PUBLIC

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.230
PROPOSAL. IT WAS BASICALLY TO

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.099
TRY TO PUSH SCHOOLS TO OPEN.

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.734
BECAUSE OF MOST COUNTIES WERE

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.736
PURPLE NOT MOVING TOWARD THE

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:56.038
RED END THERE NEEDED TO BE

01:12:56.105 --> 01:12:58.140
INCENTIVES TO DO THAT. AND IN

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.975
THE COURSE OF THAT DISCUSSION.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.177
COUNTY CASE LOADS OF DROPPED

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.278
MANY ARE ON THE VERGE OF

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:06.048
DROPPING INTO THE RED. SO PART

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:07.583
OF THIS SAYS THEY'LL STILL BE A

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:09.485
POLISH WITH MONEY AND

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.653
INCENTIVES TO OPEN. BUT TWO

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.056
THIRDS OF IT OF THE MONEY SAYS

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.724
WILL ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE RE

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:17.259
OPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE HEADED IN

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:18.694
THE RIGHT WAY IN THE PANDEMIC

01:13:18.761 --> 01:13:21.263
AND THEY NEED THE HELP. TO RE

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:23.966
OPEN. IN A AND I THINK SENATOR

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.567
DRAWS OR RAISED A VERY

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:29.104
IMPORTANT POINT. WHICH IS IF

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.540
YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT SAFE. OR

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:32.674
YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:33.942
DISADVANTAGED TO THERE'S A HIGH

01:13:34.009 --> 01:13:36.645
CASELOAD. WHAT'S THE ASSURANCE

01:13:36.712 --> 01:13:38.680
FOR SAFETY WHAT'S THE ASSURANCE

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.649
THAT DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:42.851
WILL NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. WARNER

01:13:42.918 --> 01:13:45.287
RIGHT HERE IT'S THAT IN THOSE

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.489
HEAVY CASELOAD LEVELS THAT'S

01:13:47.556 --> 01:13:49.324
WHERE THE TESTING WILL BE

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:50.893
THAT'S WHERE THE TESTING. CAN

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:53.128
BE PAID FOR BY THE MONEY. THAT

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:53.996
THE THAT'S WHERE IT ALL

01:13:54.062 --> 01:13:55.931
HAPPENED AND ADDITIONALLY

01:13:55.998 --> 01:13:59.334
THAT'S WHY PRIORITIZING THOSE

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.669
THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND BY

01:14:00.736 --> 01:14:02.538
DISTANCE LEARNING FIRST BY

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:04.773
MAKING SURE. IF THEY WERE

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:06.909
FOSTER KIDS FOR HOMELESS KIDS

01:14:06.975 --> 01:14:08.710
OR AT THE RISK OF ABUSE AND

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:11.046
NEGLECT AS WAS RAISED. FOR

01:14:11.113 --> 01:14:12.748
PEOPLE THAT JUST DIDN'T THE

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:15.117
KIDS IT JUST DIDN'T ATTEND. FOR

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.518
THOSE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.620
TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITY TO DO

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.422
DISTRICTS WARNING OR ENGLISH

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:22.191
LANGUAGE LEARNERS MAKE SURE

01:14:22.257 --> 01:14:23.659
THAT THEY THE ONES THAT FIRST

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:25.460
DROPPED OUT. OR THE ONES

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.296
PRIORITIZED TO HAVE WE COME

01:14:27.362 --> 01:14:29.565
BACK IN SO IT SPEAKS TO THE

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:32.367
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN A

01:14:32.434 --> 01:14:36.672
VERY VERY STRONG ONE. AND

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:37.573
ANOTHER THING THAT WAS SAID. IS

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:39.641
THERE WAS AN EMPTY. THAT REALLY

01:14:39.708 --> 01:14:41.610
THIS WAS A BILL THAT CATERED TO

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:43.579
ONE PARTICULAR GROUP. WELL IF

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:44.913
YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SCHOOL

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:47.015
ADMINISTRATOR SAID WE'RE VERY

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:48.717
CONCERNED SAYS THIS DEBATE WAS

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.786
STARTED. AND SOME OF THEM CAME

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:53.355
UP IN THE DEBATE THEY SAID WE-

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:55.224
DON'T WANT TO BE PENALIZED IF

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.826
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN OPENED.

01:14:57.893 --> 01:14:58.460
THAT'S IN THIS BILL SO THEY'RE

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.629
NOT. IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF WE

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.164
WERE TESTING WE DON'T WANT TO

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.999
HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.934
DO A WHOLE NEW CADENCE THIS

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:08.537
ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBLE PROCESS FOR

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.806
THEM NOT TO BE PENALIZED. AND

01:15:10.873 --> 01:15:11.907
HAVE THAT PRE EXISTING TESTING

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:14.209
DONE. IF THEY DID A COVERT PLAN

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:17.079
ALREADY IT REALLY SAYS THAT

01:15:17.145 --> 01:15:18.881
THEY DON'T HAVE TO REDO IT IT

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:21.149
INTO I THINK IT WAS SANDRA CHOI

01:15:21.216 --> 01:15:24.519
BUGS ARE CONCERNED. THAT THESE

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:25.854
HAVE TO BE APPROVED THERE'S

01:15:25.921 --> 01:15:28.690
ACTUALLY A TIME LIMIT ON THEIR

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:30.392
APPROVAL IN THIS BILL SO THAT

01:15:30.459 --> 01:15:31.827
IF THEY'RE NOT ACTED ON BY THE

01:15:31.894 --> 01:15:33.695
ADMINISTRATORS IT AUTOMATICALLY

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.964
IS APPROVED SO THAT. THAT WILL

01:15:36.031 --> 01:15:37.866
NOT BOGGED DOWN THE PROCESS AND

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:42.337
INITIALLY THERE WAS A PROPOSAL.

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:42.871
THAT EVERY DISTRICT HAD TO

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:45.173
APPLY. S. AND THIS NO. EVERY

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.977
DISTRICT. IS IN A WAY THAT THAT

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.178
THAT DOESN'T PUT ANOTHER

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.814
BARRIER IN THE WAY. OF RE

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.484
OPENING AND SO AN ADDITIONAL IN

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.085
A SPEECH TO SENATOR DRAWS

01:15:57.152 --> 01:16:00.055
CONCERN. ORIGINALLY FROM THE

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:01.423
MONEY THE WHOLE SIX POINT SIX

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:02.691
BILLION IN THE FIRST

01:16:02.758 --> 01:16:04.793
DISCUSSIONS OF THIS. WOULD ONLY

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:06.828
GO TO THOSE THAT WE OPEN EARLY.

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:08.196
AND YET THAT WAS

01:16:08.263 --> 01:16:09.898
DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFLUENT

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.300
DISTRICTS AND THOSE THAT WERE

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.267
BEHIND IN LINE WITH

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:13.468
DISPROPORTIONATELY

01:16:13.535 --> 01:16:15.404
DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS. AND IN

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.972
THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:19.241
DOLLARS THIS REMOVES THAT. AND

01:16:19.308 --> 01:16:20.075
IN THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.944
WHICH IS REALLY TO OPEN SAT

01:16:22.010 --> 01:16:24.413
PEOPLE TO OPEN. IF THEY CAN'T

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.581
DO IT BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:29.051
WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK OR

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.585
THE PURPLE LEVEL WAS TOO HIGH.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.922
THEN 10% OF THE OTHER MONEY CAN

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:36.258
BE USED TO HELP THEM RE OPEN IF

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:40.429
THEY RE OPEN. LATELY SO THAT

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:43.231
FLEXIBILITY. IS THERE SO RE.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:46.435
THIS WAS HARD AND IT IS HARD

01:16:46.501 --> 01:16:49.271
BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADDRESS ALL

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:52.841
THE KIDS IN THE FALL THE OVER

01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:53.475
ONE THOUSAND DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:56.845
IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE TO TRY

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.981
TO EXPEDITE THE RE OPENING BUT

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:00.415
WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE

01:17:00.482 --> 01:17:02.250
FEEL SAFE WHETHER THEY'RE THE

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:03.752
TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM OR

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.053
THE PARENTS THEY'RE SENDING

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:06.822
THEIR KIDS BACK AND I THINK

01:17:06.888 --> 01:17:08.557
THAT'S THE BALANCE WE TRIED TO

01:17:08.623 --> 01:17:13.228
STRIKE IN THIS. SO I FEEL LIKE.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.130
THIS WAS HARD FOR A REASON AND

01:17:15.197 --> 01:17:17.032
YOU CAN JUST GET IT BY THE WAY

01:17:17.099 --> 01:17:19.201
I'M TALKING ABOUT IT. OVER A

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.635
THOUSAND DISTRICTS PEOPLE WITH

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:22.704
HIGH CASELOADS PEOPLE WITH LOW

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.373
CASELOADS PEOPLE THAT WANT

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.907
THEIR KIDS BACK RIGHT NOW.

01:17:25.974 --> 01:17:27.476
PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:17:27.542 --> 01:17:28.510
THE HEALTH OF PUTTING THEIR

01:17:28.577 --> 01:17:30.278
KIDS BACK. TEACHERS DON'T WANT

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.514
TO KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING BACK

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:35.083
IN THE PURPLE OF. HERE THAT

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.685
THEY ACCESS TO PUBLIC

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.754
HEALTH MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:40.889
IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. AND I

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:43.225
THINK THIS IS GOOD THERE'S A

01:17:43.291 --> 01:17:45.460
REASON WHY. IS IT THAT THEY'RE

01:17:45.527 --> 01:17:48.563
SORT OF PEOPLE AT THE STRONG

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.699
HANDS OF BOTH ENDS OF THIS.

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:51.933
THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.002
BILL. THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.937
BE CONCERNED THAT WE ARE NOT.

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.040
ADDRESSING INEQUITIES AND THOSE

01:17:58.106 --> 01:17:59.207
THAT ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT

01:17:59.274 --> 01:18:00.976
WE'RE NOT PUSHING HARD ENOUGH

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.145
AND YET WE HAD TO HAVE A BILL.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:05.080
THAT'S FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.915
AND FOR EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:18:06.982 --> 01:18:09.017
THAT ENTERED ADDRESSES EVERY

01:18:09.084 --> 01:18:10.285
SITUATION THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:12.621
FACING AND IT'S NOT A COOKIE

01:18:12.687 --> 01:18:14.423
CUTTER APPROACH. IT TO DO NO

01:18:14.489 --> 01:18:17.592
HARM. AND ALLOW FOR FLEXIBILITY

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:19.861
FOR LOCAL DISTRICTS SO I THINK.

01:18:19.928 --> 01:18:22.164
THIS IS A GOOD BILL THAT TAKES

01:18:22.230 --> 01:18:25.600
INTO ACCOUNT ALL THOSE THINGS

01:18:25.667 --> 01:18:27.302

PUBLIC. AND THEN WE WILL MOVE

01:18:33.341 --> 01:18:36.812

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:22.770
WOULD BE THE EARLIEST THESE

01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:25.272
SCHOOLS COULD BE OPENING.

01:37:25.339 --> 01:37:28.742

CHANGED RELIGION ARE A BIT OF A

01:37:40.020 --> 01:37:41.889
CONFLICT THERE COULD FINANCE AS

01:37:41.956 --> 01:37:44.225
OF THAT DATE QUESTION

BE SOME POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND

01:38:02.443 --> 01:38:03.844
DIFFICULTIES WITH THESE DATES

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:06.513

WORKING ON THIS LITERALLY SINCE

01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:39.146
DECEMBER AND THOSE ARE STAFF IN

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:42.549
BOTH HOUSES- AND- MANY OFFICES

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.451
AND OF COURSE IN WITHIN THE

01:38:44.518 --> 01:38:46.453
ADMINISTRATION ADDITIONALLY AND

01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.855
OF COURSE MANY MANY MEMBERS

01:38:47.921 --> 01:38:51.325
HAVE ALSO. BEEN SPENDING MANY

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.027
HOURS ON THIS AS WELL AS

01:38:53.093 --> 01:38:53.894
STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:55.863
STATE AND THERE WERE VARIOUS

01:38:55.929 --> 01:38:57.998
REFERENCES IN THIS DEBATE TO

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.733
CERTAIN STAKEHOLDER SOMEHOW

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.503
GETTING MORE THAN OTHERS AND- I

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.772
STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT

01:39:04.838 --> 01:39:08.275
ASSERTION. THIS IS HARD AS

01:39:08.342 --> 01:39:10.744
SENATOR LAYERED POINTED OUT.

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:14.148
THE DETAILS MATTER. AS MUCH AS

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:16.850
THERE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE

01:39:16.917 --> 01:39:19.086
REASONS TO GET OUR KIDS BACK TO

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:21.055
SCHOOL SOME FAST AS POSSIBLE.

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:22.756
IN MANY PARENTS WHO WANT THAT

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.425
THERE ARE ALSO MANY PARENTS WHO

01:39:24.491 --> 01:39:27.961
ARE AFRAID AND ARE CONCERNED TO

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:29.229
HAVE THEIR CHILD GO BACK TO

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:31.098
SCHOOL AND POTENTIALLY BRING

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.000
THE VIRUS BACK INTO THEIR HOMES

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:34.668
AND PUT SUCH SOMEONE IN THEIR

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.870
FAMILY AT RISK. AND WHILE WE

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:40.140
HAVE MANY OTHER WORKERS WHO ARE

01:39:40.207 --> 01:39:42.109
HAVE IN EFFECT NO CHOICE

01:39:42.176 --> 01:39:45.212
ECONOMICALLY BUT TO GO TO WORK

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:46.780
C. WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND OTHERS.

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:48.382
MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO IN FEAR

01:39:48.449 --> 01:39:50.551
EVERY DAY OF BRINGING THE VIRUS

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:54.722
HOME. BEYOND WHAT WE NEEDED TO

01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:58.225
DO WAS STRIKE A BALANCE THAT

01:39:58.292 --> 01:39:59.360
GOT OUR KIDS BACK INTO THE

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:01.695
CLASSROOM BUT ABSOLUTELY

01:40:01.762 --> 01:40:04.131
MINIMIZE THAT RISK. BY BRINGING

01:40:04.198 --> 01:40:06.600
THAT BUYERS HOME WEATHER HOME

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:09.336
TO THE CHURCH STUDENTS FAMILY

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.871
TO THE STAFF'S FAMILY OR TO THE

01:40:10.938 --> 01:40:12.373
TEACHER'S FAMILY WHICH OF

01:40:12.439 --> 01:40:14.641
COURSE WOULD EXACERBATES BACK

01:40:14.708 --> 01:40:17.678
COMMUNITY SPREAD. AND MANY OF

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:19.513
US HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING GERMANY

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.882
AND- I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:26.854
WITH- THE- THE SCIENCE BASED

01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:29.456
RESPONSE THAT THE GERMAN

01:40:29.523 --> 01:40:31.225
GOVERNMENT AND DIFFERENT LEVELS

01:40:31.291 --> 01:40:32.726
AT ALL THROUGH ALL LEVELS OF

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.862
GOVERNMENT HAVE HAD THE-

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:36.930
BASICALLY THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF

01:40:36.997 --> 01:40:39.566
IT HERE IT'S SOCIALLY TO BE

01:40:39.633 --> 01:40:40.901
MASK WEARING INTO OTHER

01:40:40.968 --> 01:40:44.338
PROTOCOLS AND YET. GERMANY

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:48.308
ITSELF ONLY RE OPENED THEIR

01:40:48.375 --> 01:40:50.744
SCHOOLS THIS WEEK. THEY ALSO

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.679
HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:40:52.746 --> 01:40:57.418
SPREAD AND SO I THINK THAT WE

01:40:57.484 --> 01:40:59.286
NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND

01:40:59.353 --> 01:41:01.288
WANTS TO GET CODE NINETEEN NO

01:41:01.355 --> 01:41:03.824

01:41:03.891 --> 01:41:06.794
DEVELOPED HERE. AND IT TOOK A

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:09.963
LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS.

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.800
DIFFICULT TO WORK OUT SOMETHING

01:41:12.866 --> 01:41:15.602
THAT REALLY MET THE NEEDS OF

01:41:15.669 --> 01:41:17.805

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:20.574
