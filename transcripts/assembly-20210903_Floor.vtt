STATE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:35:56.283 --> 01:35:59.587
ARE ONLY ONE OF FOUR STATES.

01:35:59.653 --> 01:36:01.122
THAT DOES NOT HAVE A

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:03.591
DECERTIFICATION SYSTEM.

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.926
CALIFORNIANS CRIMINAL JUSTICE

THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM IS

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:15.603
DESPERATELY NEEDED. SB TWO IS A

01:36:15.669 --> 01:36:17.671
THOUGHTFUL WELL MEANING

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.807
APPROACH TO THIS ISSUE THAT

01:36:19.874 --> 01:36:22.510
AFFORDS AMPLE DUE PROCESS FOR

ENSURES THAT GOOD OFFICERS ARE

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:33.988
NOT DECERTIFIED. THIS BILL

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:36.290
CREATES A STATE WIDE PROCESS TO

01:36:36.357 --> 01:36:38.459
REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN

01:36:38.526 --> 01:36:40.628
OFFICER AFTER COMMITTING A

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.796
SERIOUS A SERIES OF CRIMES OR

01:36:42.863 --> 01:36:45.266
TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE

01:36:45.332 --> 01:36:49.303
TO MISCONDUCT. ADDITIONALLY

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:50.971
THIS BILL ALLOWS. THE

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:53.007
COMMISSION ON PEACE OFFICER

01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:55.109
STANDARDS AND TRAINING. ALSO

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.778
KNOWN AS POST. A COMMISSION

01:36:57.845 --> 01:37:00.114
THAT IS PRIMARILY MADE UP OF

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:02.383
LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO

01:37:02.449 --> 01:37:04.552
INVESTIGATE GROUNDS FOR OFFICER

01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:08.489
MISCONDUCT. SB TWO ALSO CREATES

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:11.025
AN ADVISORY BOARD WITH IN POST

01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:12.459
THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL

01:37:12.526 --> 01:37:16.063
RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POST

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:18.432
SHOULD DECERTIFY AN OFFICER.

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.401
FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE

01:37:20.467 --> 01:37:22.803
COMMISSION TO DEFINE. BY

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:24.572
REGULATION THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS

01:37:24.638 --> 01:37:27.474
OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT THAT

01:37:27.541 --> 01:37:27.975
WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:30.711
DECERTIFICATION. ULTIMATELY THE

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.246
COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:34.481
DEFINE WHAT EXACTLY IS KIND IT

01:37:34.548 --> 01:37:37.451
CAN LEAD TO DESERTIFICATION.

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:39.286
THIS IS NOT A PERFECT BILL. BUT

01:37:39.353 --> 01:37:41.055
THE AUTHOR HAS TAKEN A NUMBER

01:37:41.121 --> 01:37:43.057
OF AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO

01:37:43.123 --> 01:37:44.491
MANY OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY

01:37:44.558 --> 01:37:47.828
THE OPPONENTS. PREVIOUSLY THE

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:49.230
ADVISORY BOARD INCLUDED TWO

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.265
PUBLIC MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:53.334
VICTIMS OF POLICE MISCONDUCT OR

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.736

SUFFERED PLEASE MAKE CONTACT.

01:37:58.272 --> 01:37:59.540
NOW THOSE TWO SEATS ARE

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:01.475
GENERALLY FOR NOT ENFORCEMENT

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.210
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:04.578
STRONG CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:06.180
WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN IMPACTED

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:09.583
BY POLICE VIOLENCE. PREVIOUSLY

01:38:09.650 --> 01:38:11.385
POST COMMISSION IT'D MAJORITY

01:38:11.452 --> 01:38:15.055
VOTE TO APPROVE DECERTIFICATION.

01:38:15.122 --> 01:38:16.957
NOW POST COMMISSION NEEDS A TWO

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:19.326
THIRDS VOTE IN ORDER TO

01:38:19.393 --> 01:38:21.462
DECERTIFY SOMEONE AND WE ALL

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:23.631
KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:25.866
A TWO THIRDS VOTE IN THIS HOUSE.

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:30.104
PREVIOUSLY THE BILL WAS SILENT

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:32.339
ON PRIOR CLAIMS OF ADJUDICATION.

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:34.975
NOW THE BILL EXPLICITLY STATES

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.143
THAT NOTHING IN THE BILL

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:37.778
CHANGES EXISTING LAW ABOUT

01:38:37.845 --> 01:38:41.315
COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL. PREVIOUSLY

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:44.318
POSED MUSTY CERTIFYING OFFICER

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.519
WHO HAD COMMITTED SERIOUS

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:49.290
MISCONDUCT. NOW POST HAS THE

01:38:49.356 --> 01:38:52.159
OPTION OF DECERTIFYING THE

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.061
SPENDING CERTIFICATION OR

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:56.930
IMPOSING NO SANCTIONS AT ALL

01:38:56.997 --> 01:38:58.432
FOR OFFICERS WHO COMMITTED

01:38:58.499 --> 01:39:00.868
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. POST HAS

01:39:00.934 --> 01:39:02.069
THE OPTION TO SUSPEND AN

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.904
OFFICER OR IMPOSE NO SANCTION

01:39:03.971 --> 01:39:06.707
AT ALL EVEN IF THE ADVISORY

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:07.074
BOARD RECOMMENDS

01:39:07.141 --> 01:39:09.910
DECERTIFICATION. I WOULD LIKE

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.145
TO KNOW THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.413
A TECHNICAL ERROR BY

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:13.747
LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL REGARDING

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:14.748
ONE OF THE AMENDMENT IN THIS

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:17.151
BILL. THE AMENDMENT CLARIFYING

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:19.053
THAT EXISTING LAW OF COLLATERAL

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.188
ESTOPPEL APPLIES. TO THIS BILL

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.623
WAS PLACED IN THE WRONG SECTION

01:39:22.690 --> 01:39:24.625
BUT IT WILL BE CORRECTED IN A

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:25.192
DIFFERENT BILL IN THE COMING

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:28.896
DAYS. SO IN CONCLUSION SB TWO

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:30.097
CREATES ONE OF THE STRONGEST

01:39:30.164 --> 01:39:32.066
DECERTIFICATION SYSTEMS ACROSS

01:39:32.132 --> 01:39:34.234
THE COUNTRY. WITH MORE DUE

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:37.104

CIVILIAN REPRESENTATION AND PUT.

01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:42.843
AT EVERY STAGE IN THIS PROCESS.

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.311
THERE IS LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:46.814
REPRESENTATION. IN FACT THE

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.615
PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF INPUT FOR

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.351
THE ENTIRE PROCESS IS LAW

ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING POST

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:55.322
COMMISSION. THE ROLE OF LAW

01:39:55.389 --> 01:39:59.259
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT TO SERVE NOT

01:39:59.326 --> 01:40:01.995
ONLY TO SERVE BUT PROTECT.

01:40:02.062 --> 01:40:05.099
PROTECT THE CITIZENS PROTECT

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:07.234
THE INTEGRITY OF THE BATCH AND

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:10.137
PROTECT LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:13.874
IS NOT AN ANTI POLICE BILL.

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:16.243
THIS IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY BAIL.

01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:18.379
WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY WE

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:21.248
LOSE INTEGRITY OF THE BAD AND

01:40:21.315 --> 01:40:21.849
THE BOND WITH THE COMMUNITY IS

01:40:21.915 --> 01:40:25.219
BROKEN. A BROKEN BOND AND

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:26.353
DISCUSSED CAN LEAD TO THE

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.156
EVENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN ALL

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:29.757
OVER THIS COUNTRY AND EVEN IN

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:31.759

REST OF THE NATION. YEAH WE ARE

01:40:45.038 --> 01:40:46.974
SO FAR BEHIND IN THIS ISSUE OF

01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:48.976
DECERTIFICATION THAT WE NEED TO

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:50.778
CATCH UP TO THE FORTY SIX OTHER

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.413

POWER IS PROPERLY HELD

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:15.969

THOSE WHO ABIDE BY THEIR OATH

01:41:49.703 --> 01:41:51.572
OF SERVICE. LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:41:51.638 --> 01:41:52.906
ARGUES THAT OF THEIR AGENCY

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:54.274
DIDN'T FIRE THEM FOR SERIOUS

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:56.643
MISCONDUCT IMPOSED SHOULD NOT

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.946
BE ABLE TO TAKE ANY ACTION.

01:41:59.012 --> 01:42:00.547
THEY SAY THIS EXPOSES THEM TO

01:42:00.614 --> 01:42:02.649
DOUBLE JEOPARDY. HOWEVER THIS

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:04.017
IS NOT WHAT DOUBLE JEOPARDY IS

01:42:04.084 --> 01:42:05.919
A AS A FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDER I

01:42:05.986 --> 01:42:09.323
CAN ASSURE YOU. DOUBLE JEOPARDY

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.991
MEANS BEING PROSECUTED TWICE

01:42:11.058 --> 01:42:12.159
FOR THE SAME PROSECUTOR FOR THE

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:13.927
EXACT SAME CRIME ONCE A

TRY AGAIN IN HOPES OF A

01:42:18.799 --> 01:42:20.367
DIFFERENT RESULT. THIS IS

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.870
ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT. POST

01:42:22.936 --> 01:42:24.271
BRINGING DECERTIFICATION

01:42:24.338 --> 01:42:26.340
PROCEEDINGS IS NOT THE SAME AS

01:42:26.406 --> 01:42:28.475
EMPLOYING LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:30.043
AGENCIES BRINGING DISCIPLINE.

01:42:30.110 --> 01:42:33.180
AS AN ATTORNEY. I CAN BE

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:36.016
INVESTIGATED M. DISBARRED BY

THE STATE BAR EVEN IF MY

EMPLOYER DOES NOT FIRE ME THIS

01:42:39.653 --> 01:42:41.622
APPLIES NOT ONLY TO ATTORNEY

01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:44.091
TURNS WORKING PRIVATE FIRMS BUT

01:42:44.157 --> 01:42:46.226
FOR THOSE WHO WORK FOR

01:42:46.293 --> 01:42:48.562
GOVERNMENT OR STATE AGENCIES.

01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:50.631
SAME GOES FOR OTHER LICENSED

01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:52.232
PROFESSIONS THINK ABOUT A

01:42:52.299 --> 01:42:53.166
DOCTOR'S CAN LOSE THEIR

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:54.835
LICENSES EVEN IF THEY'RE STILL

01:42:54.902 --> 01:42:58.505
EMPLOYED. THE CALIBER CALIBER

01:42:58.572 --> 01:42:58.939
WOULD BE THE KIND OF

01:42:59.006 --> 01:43:01.141
ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS KIND OF

01:43:01.208 --> 01:43:02.943
ACCOUNTABILITY IS HOW WE ENSURE

01:43:03.010 --> 01:43:03.977
THAT PEOPLE WHO VIOLATE

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:05.312
PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS STOP

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:07.381
HARMING THE PUBLIC EVEN IF

01:43:07.447 --> 01:43:08.615
THEIR EMPLOYER HAS DECIDED TO

01:43:08.682 --> 01:43:10.517
OVERLOOK THEIR BEHAVIOR

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:13.387
ESPECIALLY. IF THEIR JOB IS TO

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:16.490
PROTECT AND SERVE THE PUBLIC.

01:43:16.557 --> 01:43:18.425
NEVERTHELESS THE AUTHOR AS

01:43:18.492 --> 01:43:20.027

SAN DIEGO HAS TAKEN AMENDMENTS

01:43:22.329 --> 01:43:27.768
TO FURTHER CLARIFY THIS ISSUE.

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.002
ONE OFFICER COMMITS EXCESSIVE

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.337
USE OF FORCE SEXUAL ASSAULT AND

01:43:30.404 --> 01:43:32.539

WARRANT A FAIR AND TRANSPARENT

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:36.877
PROCESS BY POSTERS CHARMAN IF

01:43:36.944 --> 01:43:38.946
THAT OFFICER IS WORTHY OF

01:43:39.012 --> 01:43:40.681
HOLDING THAT BATCH. THE PUBLIC

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:41.949
IS LOSING TRUST IN LAW

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:10.097
UP AN ECHO WHAT OUR COLLEAGUE

01:46:10.163 --> 01:46:12.099
FROM SAN DIEGO HAS SAID. THIS

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:14.034

01:46:24.811 --> 01:46:26.113
INCIDENTS WHERE THEN WE SEE

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:28.882
LIFE TAKEN AGAIN. AND IF WE CAN

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:30.650
SAVE THOSE LIVES MEMBERS WE

01:46:30.717 --> 01:46:34.321
MUST. THAT IS THE OBLIGATION

01:46:34.387 --> 01:46:36.423
THAT WE HAVE ONE OF MANY. AND

01:46:36.490 --> 01:46:37.824

WE MADE SURE THAT DUE PROCESS

01:46:44.865 --> 01:46:47.167

CARRY THE BAGGAGE DO IT WITH

01:46:50.971 --> 01:46:53.607

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.509
RISE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS

01:47:29.576 --> 01:47:32.512
PARTICULAR VERSION OF SB TWO.

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:33.480
WHILE THERE IS BIPARTISAN

01:47:33.547 --> 01:47:35.148
AGREEMENT AN AGREEMENT AMONG

01:47:35.215 --> 01:47:36.616
SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS LAW

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:38.051
ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYERS AND EVEN

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:39.186
THE REPRESENTATIVES LAW

01:47:39.252 --> 01:47:41.254
ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEES. THAT

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:42.956
CALIFORNIA SHOULD JOIN THE

01:47:43.023 --> 01:47:44.958
OTHER FORTY SIX STATES. AND BY

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:47.561
HAVING A STATUTORY MECHANISM TO

01:47:47.627 --> 01:47:49.029
SUSPEND OR DECERTIFY LAW

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:50.730
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FOR

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:53.733
MISCONDUCT. BY THAT FALL SHORT

01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:55.602
A FELONY CONVICTION. I WOULD

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:57.304
SUPPORT A BILL TO DO THAT AS

01:47:57.370 --> 01:47:58.872
LONG AS IT CONTAINED REASONABLE

01:47:58.939 --> 01:48:00.841
STANDARDS AND FAIR PROCEDURES

01:48:00.907 --> 01:48:03.376
UNFORTUNATELY. ALTHOUGH RECENT

01:48:03.443 --> 01:48:04.711
AMENDMENTS HAVE IMPROVED THIS

01:48:04.778 --> 01:48:06.446
BILL SOMEWHAT SB TWO IS NOT THE

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:09.449
BILL. I HAVE THREE MAJOR

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.685
CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL. FIRST

01:48:11.751 --> 01:48:13.753
IS THE COMPOSITION OF THE NINE

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.789
MEMBER PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS

01:48:15.856 --> 01:48:18.158
ACCOUNTABILITY ADVISORY BOARD.

01:48:18.225 --> 01:48:20.794
IT IS GROSSLY UNFAIR. IT

01:48:20.861 --> 01:48:21.862
INCLUDES ONLY TWO

01:48:21.928 --> 01:48:23.029
REPRESENTATIVES OF LAW

01:48:23.096 --> 01:48:24.364
ENFORCEMENT NEITHER OF THEM

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:26.366
REPRESENTING RANK AND FILE

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:31.137
OFFICERS. SIX OR SEVEN OF THE

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:34.875
OTHERS CAN BE. ARE VERY HOSTILE

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:36.543
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THIS

01:48:36.610 --> 01:48:39.079
CREATES A BIAS. THE REASON

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:40.480
AMENDMENT PROVIDING THAT THE

01:48:40.547 --> 01:48:42.182
GOVERNOR IS ONLY REQUIRED TO

01:48:42.249 --> 01:48:44.384
GIVE STRONG CONSIDERATION TO

01:48:44.451 --> 01:48:45.685
APPOINTING TO MEMBERS WHO HAVE

01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:47.854
BEEN SUBJECT TO RUN FULL USE OF

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:50.190
FORCE LIKELY THE CAUSE DEATH OR

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.992
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY BY POLICE

01:48:52.058 --> 01:48:54.194
OFFICER OR WHO ARE SURVIVING

01:48:54.261 --> 01:48:55.996
FAMILY MEMBERS OF A PERSON

01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:57.831
KILLED. BY THE WRONGFUL USE OF

01:48:57.898 --> 01:48:59.766
DEADLY FORCE BY POLICE OFFICERS

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:03.036
IS SMALL COMFORT. THE TRUTH IS

01:49:03.103 --> 01:49:03.937
OF THE BOARDS THAT WE HAVE

01:49:04.004 --> 01:49:05.405
TALKED ABOUT DOCTORS AND

01:49:05.472 --> 01:49:08.608
LAWYERS. THEIR BOARDS DON'T

01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:10.911
HAVE PEOPLE. THAT WE'RE BEEN

01:49:10.977 --> 01:49:12.746
ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A BAD

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:18.184
SURGERY. OR BAD REPRESENTATION

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:19.286
THEY HAVE LAWYERS THEY HAVE

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.687
PROFESSIONALS THAT KNOW WHAT

01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:23.056
THAT JOB IS. AND THIS DOES NOT

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:26.559
DO THAT. NONE OF THE OTHER

01:49:26.626 --> 01:49:27.594
FORTY SIX STATES HAVE A SIMILAR

01:49:27.661 --> 01:49:29.396
COMPOSITION FOR THEIR OVERSIGHT

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:32.299
BOARDS AND MAKE THIS

01:49:32.365 --> 01:49:34.434
DECERTIFICATION DETERMINATION.

01:49:34.501 --> 01:49:35.802
SOME STATES HAVE BOARDS THAT DO

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:37.037
NOT HAVE A MAJORITY OF LAW

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.839
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT NONE

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:42.242
OF THEM. ARE THIS LOPSIDED. FOR

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.910
EXAMPLE MASSACHUSETTS WHICH IS

01:49:43.977 --> 01:49:45.779
HARDLY A BASTION OF

01:49:45.845 --> 01:49:47.113
CONSERVATIVE IT'S OF THE STATE.

01:49:47.180 --> 01:49:51.418
BUT- IT ADOPTED IN YOUR SEARCH

01:49:51.484 --> 01:49:53.486
DECERTIFICATION LAW LAST YEAR.

01:49:53.553 --> 01:49:54.521
THERE BOARD INCLUDE THE

APPOINTED JOINTLY. BY THE

01:50:07.867 --> 01:50:09.636
GOVERNOR THIS IS A MUCH FAIRER

01:50:09.703 --> 01:50:11.938
COMPOSITION THAN THE ONE

01:50:12.005 --> 01:50:15.608
PROPOSED IN SB TWO. THE OTHER

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:17.811
ISSUE I HAD WITH IT IS THE BIG.

01:50:17.877 --> 01:50:19.079
DESCRIPTION OF MANY OF THE NON

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:24.217

STATEMENT THAT THEY'VE MADE

01:50:34.127 --> 01:50:35.662
THAT OTHER PEOPLE MISCONSTRUE

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:36.730

CURRENT. FORM IT'S HARD FOR ME

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:50.243
TO IT. SO SHOULD THE OTHER

FORTY SIX STATES AND HAVING A

01:50:52.278 --> 01:50:54.314
DECERTIFICATION BILL BUT WE

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.450
SHOULD ALSO USE THOSE BILLS

01:50:57.517 --> 01:50:58.084
THAT ARE IN THE OTHER FORTY SIX

01:50:58.151 --> 01:51:01.454

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:03.289
THAT IT IS FAIR THAT IT IS NOT

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:06.426
BIASED. AND I THINK ANYBODY WHO

ON A JURY. AND THIS IS THE SAME

01:51:14.601 --> 01:51:18.038

01:53:07.747 --> 01:53:10.150
MURDER HE'S NOT A RACIST. HE'S

01:53:10.216 --> 01:53:11.718
A GOOD PERSON THIS UP TO DO THE

01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:13.453
JOB PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.388

TIME TO TIME ASSUME. IT ONE OF

01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:25.098
THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR ME

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:27.100
IS. WHEN I'M WITH THEM OVER THE

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:29.202
WEEKENDS A TIME BEFORE I COME

01:53:29.269 --> 01:53:30.770
BACK UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO. I

01:53:30.837 --> 01:53:32.238
HOPE THAT ISN'T THE LAST TIME I

SEE MY SON. AND YOU KNOW WHY

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:37.076
BECAUSE WE DO SOME LEGISLATION.

01:53:37.143 --> 01:53:40.046
TO FIX THINGS I THINK WE MIGHT

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:40.647
GET WORSE FOR OFFICERS BECAUSE

01:53:40.713 --> 01:53:42.649
NOW. THEY HAD DURING THE

01:53:42.715 --> 01:53:43.249
TRANSFER GOING TO SECOND GUESS

01:53:43.316 --> 01:53:45.685
THEMSELVES. SHOULD I STOP THAT

01:53:45.752 --> 01:53:47.854
PERSON SHOULD I NOT ARREST THIS

01:53:47.921 --> 01:53:49.856
PERSON BECAUSE IF I DO I'M

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:50.390
GOING TO BE CONSIDERED A

01:53:50.456 --> 01:53:52.892
RACIST. BUT TAKE OUT MY GOD WHY

01:53:52.959 --> 01:53:53.927

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.428
THIS GUY'S GOING TO KILL ME

01:53:55.495 --> 01:53:57.997
BECAUSE I'M BLACK OR BROWN. NOW

01:53:58.064 --> 01:54:00.733
MY SON'S LIKE. BECAUSE OF THAT

01:54:00.800 --> 01:54:01.968
I JUST HOPE THAT HE DOESN'T DIE

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:03.603
IN THE LINE OF DUTY AS HE MAY

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.572
HAVE SECOND GUESSED HIMSELF.

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:07.240
BECAUSE HE DON'T WANT TO BE

01:54:07.307 --> 01:54:07.807
LABELED THAT MURDER OR THAT

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:10.210
RACES. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:11.110
LEGISLATION THAT THAT'S PUT ON

01:54:11.177 --> 01:54:13.379
THEM. THE FEELS LIKE MAYBE WE

01:54:13.446 --> 01:54:14.881
ARE ANTI POLICE EVEN THOUGH

01:54:14.948 --> 01:54:17.750
WE'RE NOT. BUT THE IN

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:18.785
IMPRESSION OUT THERE ON THE

01:54:18.851 --> 01:54:20.286
STREET FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT IS

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:22.222
THAT MAYBE WE ARE. ARE HERE TO

TIMES I'VE BEEN WITH THEM.

01:54:25.592 --> 01:54:26.993
BEFORE HE GOES TO WORK THEN I

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:28.661

01:54:28.728 --> 01:54:29.429
CONCERN ABOUT AS YOU LEAVES

01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:31.831
BECAUSE- I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S

01:54:31.898 --> 01:54:33.633
GOING TO COME HOME. HE PUTS THE

01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:35.835
BALLOT JOHN HE PUTS THE BEST ON

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:36.302
PROTECT HIMSELF IN THE

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:38.771

01:54:38.838 --> 01:54:40.773
CHALLENGING THIS DIFFICULT SO I

01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:41.774

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:45.411
THAT WE LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE

01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:47.380

SURPRISE COULD THIS BILL CAME

UP TODAY- BUT IT'S WHERE THEY-

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:46.599
OF DISCUSSION ON THIS IS A VERY

02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:48.934
VERY POWERFUL ISSUE. AND ONE

02:01:49.001 --> 02:01:51.404
THAT WE NEED TO GET RIGHT. WELL

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:53.272
I WOULD TELL YOU THAT'S MY

02:01:53.339 --> 02:01:55.374
PERSPECTIVE AS A- CAREER LAW

02:01:55.441 --> 02:01:56.709
ENFORCEMENT PERSON IS SPENT

02:01:56.776 --> 02:01:58.544
MOST OF MY CAREER BEING IN

02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:01.447
SUPERVISION. INTEGRITY TO THE

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:04.283
BADGE IS THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU

02:02:04.350 --> 02:02:05.551
HAVE EFFECTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:09.655
IT'S ONLY WAY. AND SO DO WE

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.357
NEED A CERTIFICATION PROCESS OF

02:02:11.424 --> 02:02:13.993
COURSE WE DO. BUT SOMETIMES OUR

02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:18.431
MOTION HELPS DEFINE WHAT WE SEE

02:02:18.497 --> 02:02:20.499
AS FAIR AND UNFAIR AND I WOULD

02:02:20.566 --> 02:02:23.302
ASK YOU TO JUST STEP BACK FROM

02:02:23.369 --> 02:02:23.869
YOUR EMOTIONALCOMMITMENT FOR

02:02:23.936 --> 02:02:25.938
JUST A MINUTE. AND THAT YOU

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:28.107
CONSIDER. ONE OF THE CONCERNS

02:02:28.174 --> 02:02:29.041
I'M JUST GOING TO MENTION ONE

02:02:29.108 --> 02:02:30.576
OF THE CONCERNS OF THIS BILL.

02:02:30.643 --> 02:02:32.378
IT'S GETTING CLOSE AND I THINK

02:02:32.445 --> 02:02:34.380
THERE'S BEEN SOME ATTEMPTS. TO

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.915
MOVE TOWARDS FAIRNESS BUT I

02:02:35.981 --> 02:02:37.883
DON'T THINK IT'S- IT'S WHERE IT

02:02:37.950 --> 02:02:39.418
NEEDS TO BE AND THIS IS A VERY

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:41.353
VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE TO OUR

02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:43.622
LAW ENFORCEMENT. VERY POWERFUL

02:02:43.689 --> 02:02:45.758
MESSAGE. THAT I THINK HAS BEEN

02:02:45.825 --> 02:02:48.294
MISUNDERSTOOD. BY MANY WHO WEAR

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.362
THE BADGE WE ALL SUFFER FROM

02:02:50.429 --> 02:02:52.898
THAT ALL OF US SOME MORE THAN

02:02:52.965 --> 02:02:55.801
OTHERS AND I WOULD SAY. PEOPLE

02:02:55.868 --> 02:02:57.069
THAT ARE NOT IN THIS ROOM ARE

02:02:57.136 --> 02:02:59.438
MORE AFFORDABLE. TOO BAD LAW

02:02:59.505 --> 02:03:02.108
ENFORCEMENT. AND THAT ALSO

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:06.011
MEANS DISENGAGE ONE FOR SENATE

02:03:06.078 --> 02:03:08.247
AND THAT IS A NATURAL RESULT TO

02:03:08.314 --> 02:03:09.648
UNFAIR LEGISLATION IS

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:13.786
DISENGAGEMENT. THINK OF IT IF

02:03:13.853 --> 02:03:15.287
YOU ARE A BADGE HOW WOULD YOU

02:03:15.354 --> 02:03:20.392
FEEL. WELL LET ME JUST TELL YOU.

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.394
ONE OF THE CONCERNS I HAVE OVER

02:03:22.461 --> 02:03:24.463
SB TWO IN ITS CURRENT STATE IS

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:25.598
THE DEFINITION OF SERIOUS

02:03:25.664 --> 02:03:28.334

02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.169
AN OFFICER MAY BE SUSPENDED FOR

02:03:30.236 --> 02:03:34.006
DECERTIFIED BY POST. WE ALL ARE

02:03:34.073 --> 02:03:35.975
VAGUELY DESCRIBED WE ALL AGREE

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.710
THAT MISCONDUCT SHORT OF A

02:03:37.777 --> 02:03:39.078
FELONY CONVICTION SHOULD BE

02:03:39.145 --> 02:03:41.280
ELIGIBLE FOR DECERTIFICATION

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:42.381
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT BEFORE

02:03:42.448 --> 02:03:44.183
WE EXPOSE AN OFFICER TO

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:46.051
POTENTIALLY BEING BANNED. IN

02:03:46.118 --> 02:03:47.353
THEIR PROFESSION BUT THE

02:03:47.419 --> 02:03:49.021

THE PERMITS POSTED TO FIND ANY

02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:13.345
ACT. THE VIOLATES THE LAW AS

02:04:13.412 --> 02:04:17.283
SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. I BELIEVE

02:04:17.349 --> 02:04:18.551
AT LEAST ONE SANCTIONS SHORT OF

02:04:18.617 --> 02:04:20.219
THE CERTIFICATION OR SUSPENSION
