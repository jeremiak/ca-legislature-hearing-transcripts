PROBLEM AFFECTING OUR YOUTH OF ALL RACES ASUS- AGES AND GENDER ACCORDING TO A TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ARTICLE. PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE CONSUMING DIETARY SUPPLEMENT NEEDS TO TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS PER YEAR. IN THE US. WELL CALIFORNIA'S AT THE FOREFRONT OF REGULATIONS CONCERNING WEIGHT LOSS DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND DIET PILLS WE CANNOT PROHIBIT THE SALE OF THESE PRODUCTS TO MINORS. DESPITE WHILE DOCUMENTED DANGERS. ADDITIONALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE POTENTIAL DANGERS OF THESE PRODUCTS AFFECT ALREADY WONDERFUL COMMUNITIES. FOR EXAMPLE WOMEN ARE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS AND OVER THE COUNTER THAT BILLS THAN MEN. I THINK AN AMERICAN ATLANTIC LATINO ADULTS ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF USING WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS THAN WHITE ADULTS. LONDON THINGS ARE 40% MORE LIKELY TO USE OVER THE COUNTER THAT BUILT IN WHITE JEANS I KNOW THIS IS A COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THE MOST HORRIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PRODUCTS. NO COMMUNITIES NEED ARE THAT THESE COMMUNITY THEATRE PROTECTION TODAY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER SEA I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. MY NAME IS DR DAYTON THE GADA AND I'M A PEDIATRICIAN AND FACULTY MEMBER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SUPPORTING ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE AND URGE YOU TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THIS IMPORTANT FAIL. THE US WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY GENERATE OVER TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AB ANNUAL REVENUE. WE HAVE ALL THE NEEDS PRODUCT AND LOCAL PHARMACIES GROCERY STORES AND HEALTH FOOD STORES. WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS ARE NOT REVIEWED BY THE FDA FOR SAFETY OR EFFECTIVENESS BEFORE THE END FOR THE MARKET. RESEARCH AFFECTING THE COMPOSITION OF THE SUPPLEMENT HAVE FOUND THAT MANY ARE LACED WITH BANNED SUBSTANCES PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. STIMULANTS THEY'RE ALL RIGHT AND OTHER TOXIC INGREDIENTS. RIGOROUS SCIENTIFIC STUDY AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN BE PERFECTLY COMPLEMENT THE POSE SERIOUS HEALTH RISKS TO CONSUMERS. FOR INSTANCE ONE RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDY FOUND THAT YOU'RE USING WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT FOUR THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE USING ORDINARY VITAMINS. SEVERE MEDICAL HARM INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATION DISABILITY AND EVEN DEATH. OTHER THANK YOU HAVE BEEN QUITE LOCKED UP WOMEN'S WITH ORGAN FAILURE HEART ATTACKS STROKES AND THAT. HE ADMITS THAT SUPPLEMENT YOU READ THE TWENTY THREE THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS EVERY YEAR WITH A QUARTER DUE TO WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT ALONE. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS RECENTLY ISSUED A REPORT STRONGLY CAUTIONING AGAINST TEAMS YOU'VE BEEN PRODUCT FOR ANY REASON. YOU CAN USE OVER THE COUNTER TOPICAL AND PILLS ARE SIX TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH AN EATING DISORDER THE NON USERS. AS A PEDIATRICIAN SPECIALIZING IN ADOLESCENT EATING DISORDERS. I HAVE CARED FOR CATHOLIC YOUTH IN THE BAY AREA REVIEWS WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENTS AND DIET PILLS. DEVELOP EATING DISORDERS. HE KEPT BECOME CRITICALLY ILL AND REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. THE NUMBER OF TEENAGERS HOSPITALISED FOR EATING DISORDER THAT YOU GET THAT HAVE DOUBLED SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC. WE NEED TO GET THESE DANGEROUS PRODUCTS OUT OF THE HANDS OF OUR KIDS. ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN FORTY ONE GIVE CALIFORNIA LAWMAKER THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE ACTION NOW TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THE TAIL WEIGHT LOSS SUPPLEMENT THAN OVER THE COUNTER DIET PILL COMBINER. ADDITIONALLY WOULD MOVE THE PRODUCT IN OPEN SHELF BEHIND THE COUNTER JUST AS WE HAVE DONE WITH OTHER RISKY PRODUCTS LIKE CIGARETTES. I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. YOU MUST ACT NOW TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. MISTER CHAIRMAN- MY SECOND WITNESS.

WE'LL GO NEXT TO LINE FIFTY EIGHT GO AHEAD PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS JULIE AND I AGREE ON OPEN THE STRATEGIC TRAINING INITIATIVES FOR THE PREVENTION OF EATING DISORDERS HI I'M CALLING IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. WE'LL GO TO LINE SIXTY TWO GO AHEAD PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME IS ALAN SHEARER FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIOECONOMICS ABOARD TORY AND WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF AB. THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. THEN WE HAVE NO OTHER LINES INTO AT THIS TIME THANK YOU TO ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WANTED TO. IN HIS SUPPORT FOR A BI THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. ALL RIGHT SAY NONE WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TO OPPOSITION WITNESSES KYLE TURK OF THE NATIONAL NATURAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. AND LARISSA SUSPENDISSE. FROM THE AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION MR TURK I UNDERSTAND ARE YOU IN THE VIDEO CONFERENCE ROOM. I'M ON THE TELEPHONE ON THE TELEPHONE OKAY GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU- THE NATURAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION IS THE OLDEST AND LARGEST TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MEMBERS NATIONWIDE. WE IN OUR MEMBERS MANY OF WHICH YOU HEARD FROM STRONGLY OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE MEMBERS OF NPA AND OTHERS LESS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENSURE THEIR PRODUCTS ARE STATE. THESE INCLUDE GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES RENDON PRODUCT TESTING AND HEARING SOME MARKETING GUIDELINES AND FOLLOWING THE STRICT RULES AND REGULATIONS THE FDA AND FTC HAVE MADE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THOSE RULES ENSURE THAT THE UNITED STATES ENJOYED THE STATE THIS DIETARY SUPPLEMENT SUPPLY IN THE WORLD. AS WRITTEN AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE PROHIBITS AND GREETINGS FROM BEING SOLD TO MINORS UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN INCLUDING THERMOGENIC AND LOOK TROPICS. THAT WOULD MEAN SCHOOL LUNCHES EGGMAN OFTEN. DECENT STEAK. AND OTHER COMMON FOOD PRODUCTS SUDDENLY BECOME CONTRABAND. AND IN OUR VIEW IT'S RIDICULOUS TO PUT THESE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NUTRITION IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO. THIS LEGISLATION APPEARS TO BE IN. A SOLUTION IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM HOWEVER THERE IS NO PROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A LINKAGE BETWEEN DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS AND EATING DISORDERS. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT IT'S BECAUSE WE ASK. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE SUBMITTED A FOIA TO THE FDA TO EXPLORE. WHETHER THERE WERE ANY ADVERSE EVENTS FROM CASES INVOLVING EATING DISORDERS AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS. THE ANSWER FROM THE FDA'S NO LINKAGE BETWEEN EATING DISORDERS AND SUPPLEMENTS. IF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE WERE TO BECOME LAW MANY PRODUCTS SUCH AS VITAMIN D. AND CALCIUM WOULD NOT BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE UNDER EIGHTEEN AND THIS WOULD BE A CATASTROPHIC IMPACT ON VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES USING IS A CENTRAL PRODUCTS TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR HEALTH AND GET THE CRITICAL NUTRIENTS THEY NEED. BY PUTTING THESE SUPPLEMENTS BEHIND THE COUNTER THE BILL WOULD FURTHER STIGMATIZE THOSE FIGHTING WEIGHT MANAGEMENT ISSUES WHO ALREADY FACE A RANGE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. AND EXCELLING SAFE DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS SHOULD NOT BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE YEAH UNDER THIS BILL- THE FINE FOR SELLING NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS WOULD BE FOUR TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE FINES FOR SELLING ALCOHOL OR TOBACCO TO A MINOR. IF AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE PASSES IT WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE SALE OF PRODUCTS LIKE WHEY PROTEIN AND AMINO ACIDS. BUT BEYOND THE ABSURDITY OF TREATING HEALTHY AND NUTRITIONAL INGREDIENTS LIKE A PUBLIC ENEMY THERE'S A BROADER ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO CONSIDER IN CALIFORNIA THE NATURAL PRODUCTS INDUSTRY SUPPORTS OVER FIFTY THOUSAND JOBS BUT IT WOULDN'T JUST BE SUPPLEMENT STORES GROCERY STORES RESTAURANTS AND OTHERS WOULD ALSO POTENTIALLY BECOME VICTIMS WHY WE BELIEVE. WHICH IS WHY WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR THIS BILL. WE SUPPORT THE EFFORTS TO STOP ILLEGAL DRUGS MASQUERADING AS NATURAL PRODUCTS BEING SOLD TO CONSUMERS AND ESPECIALLY TO MINORS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS VASTLY FORSMAN POWERS AND HAS A LONG TRACK RECORD OF PUNISHING CRIMINALS WHO BREAK THE LAW. MPA SUPPORTS VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW TO PROTECT CONSUMERS BILL THIS LEGISLATION WILL NOT ACCOMPLISH THAT WILL WORK AGAINST THE EXISTING LAW THAT IS WELL DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE MORE THAN THREE IN FOUR AMERICANS TO USE A NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENT. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THEN I HAVE A RECESSES BUTTONS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAWRENCE THE FACT THAT AS WITH MILLER'S FACT THAT IT'S AN ASSOCIATE AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN HERBAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION. WELL WE SUPPORT THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S GOAL OF ATTRACTING THIS SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM OF EATING DISORDERS AMONG YEARS. WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPONENT EP THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. ALTHOUGH THE BILL IS WELL INTENTIONED IT WAS ONLY TO SCAPEGOAT DIETARY SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS WITHOUT ACTUALLY EDUCATING THE TEAM. TO HELP. FIRST AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO WELL ESTABLISHED DIRECT REGULATION ENFORCEMENT TEAM THE FDA FTC BOTH HAVE CLEAR AUTHORITY ALREADY DIETARY SUPPLEMENT THROUGH THE FEDERAL FOOD DRUG COSMETIC ACT AND THE FTC ACT. THE FDA AND CHARGED WITH INSPECTING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES REVIEWING LABELING AND MONITORING PRODUCTS FOR SAFETY WELL THE FCC IN EFFECT OF FALSE AND MISLEADING ADVERTISING. IT'S A FACT CONTRADICTS THE FATHER'S ARGUMENTS THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE IMMACULATE CLIP IN ADEQUATELY REGULATED FOR THEIR ADVERTISING. IS FALSE AND MISLEADING. SECOND IT DIDN'T TO NOTE THE GUY STUFF CAN INGREDIENTS CITED BY THE DOCTORS. SUCH AS THE FEDERAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL. ARE BANNED FROM SALE BY THE FDA AND ARE THEREFORE ALREADY ILLEGAL. LASTLY THE EXTENT THAT REASONABLE MINDS MIGHT DISAGREE ON THE UTILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE PROPER PRODUCT AND IT'S THE HARSHEST FORM OF PRODUCT REGULATION. AND SHOULD THEREFORE BE AFFIRMATIVELY SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE. INDICATE THE EVIDENCE SHOULD SHOW A CORRELATION BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND EATING DISORDERS BODY DYSMORPHIC DISORDER. WE HAVE THAT QUESTION WHETHER THIS STUDY CITED THE RECTIFIED BONTA PROVIDED EVIDENCE. A REVIEW OF THE REFERENCE DATE. PROVIDED SHOWS THAT YOU HAVE THREE IDENTIFIED THAT HE DID NOT ACTUALLY EVALUATE MEATLOAF PRODUCTS ARE PRESENT EVIDENCE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY TEENS- AT LEAST LEVELS BEYOND MANUFACTURE RECOMMENDATION. UNFORTUNATELY THE OWNER AT THE END OF THE BILL AND TO BROADEN THE PRODUCT THAT COVERS. INCLUDING SOME THAT WE THINK WOULD BE INADVERTENTLY COVERED IT'D BROAD DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL. WILL LEAD TO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING PUSHING CONSUMERS TO PURCHASE PRODUCTS FROM DUBIOUS FELLERS IN ONLINE MARKETPLACES WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ADULTERATED PRODUCTS ARE SOLD. FOR THESE REASONS MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE AFTER MEDIAN ACCOUNT. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR SHOULD THE BILL MOVED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR COMMON. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE REMOTE TESTIMONY SIDE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. SEEING NONE ABOUT THOUGH WITH HIS VIDEO ROOM. ALL RIGHTS AND THEN ANYBODY HERE IN. THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE. THANK YOU AND IF YOU ARE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME AN EIGHTEEN T. SPECIALIST WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND YOU WILL WAIT TO BE CALLED AT THAT TIME. WILL OPEN UP LINE SIXTY FOUR GO AHEAD PLEASE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- DON GILBERT ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANKS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE IN Q. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE PROVIDE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBERS. WE'LL GO TO LINE FIFTY SIX QUIET PLACE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TATUM ACLERIS DANCE MADE BY THOSE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL FOR RESPONSIBLE NUTRITION IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE IT WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS BUT THAT OF THE REST OF THE ACCIDENT AND APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE LOWER L. SECURE AT THIS TIME. I THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. EFFORT SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE. GALLAGHER CHAU CHIU DAVIES. GONZALEZ HOLDEN KALRA KILEY MAIENSCHEIN REYES. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A QUORUM ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND QUESTIONS COMMENTS FOR THE AUTHOR. THE DALLAS FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL WE HAD A BRIEF INTERPLATE OUT YESTERDAY- I AM ASTONISHED BY THE OPPOSITION WITNESS THE FIRST OPPOSITION MIGHT MISS- AS I THINK A LOT OF WOMEN- AND IMPROBABLY MEN TOO BUT WOMEN IN PARTICULAR COULD TELL YOU. THE LACK OF RESEARCH OR DATA THAT LINKS A NUMBER OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS WITH IN DISORDERS HASN'T BEEN ADEQUATELY EXPLORED IN BUT COMMONSENSE AND ALL OF OUR EXPERIENCES CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE IS A LINK AND THAT THERE IS A DROP FOR YOUNG WOMEN- IN MY DISCUSSIONS WITH YOUR TOLD YOU I DON'T THINK YOUR BILL GOES FAR ENOUGH I WOULD ALSO- ASKED THAT IN THE FUTURE WE LOOK AT POSSIBLY TAKING WATER PILLS AND LAXATIVES OFF OF THE OVER THE COUNTER- OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PURCHASE. AS THEY ARE GATEWAYS INTO HERBAL SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE DANGEROUS THEY ARE IN THEMSELVES DANGEROUS TO YOUNG WOMEN. AND SO AT I THINK THAT THIS ISSUE IN THE EXPLORATION OF THIS ISSUE IS WAIT PASSED OVER TO- I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE TAKING IT OUT IT'S DIFFICULT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT WORK AND- YOU KNOW HOW. WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER NOT THAT WE'RE NOT ANYMORE- BUT THERE WAS A BROAD DISCUSSION ABOUT ALL THE AFTER SCHOOL SPECIALS THAT BASICALLY GAVE US A ROADMAP TO BECOMING- GAMINI DISORDERS TO BE QUITE HONEST. IN AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THEM START A LOT OF THE REALLY DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR STARTS WITH- WHAT IS LESS DESTRUCTIVE I. THOUGHT TO BE LESS DISTRACTED BY GIRLS WHICH IS THE TAKING OF OVER THE COUNTER MEDICATION- THAT WOULD LEAD TO THE SOUTH I WANT TO THANK YOU WHEN APPLIED YOU ARE. GOING TO ASK YOU AND BY YOU IN YOUR SPONSORS TO THINK ABOUT IF NOT THIS YEAR IN THE FUTURE XP I MEAN THAT'S BECAUSE- FROM MY EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE AROUND ME IT ALL STARTS WITH WATER PILLS MOST ON THE LAXATIVES MIXON TO THIS SO- THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE BUT THANK YOU FOR THIS FIRST STEP AND I'M I'M- GOING TO BE JOINING YOU AS A JOINT AUTHORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT C. NONE MAY CLOSE AT YES I DO WANT TO QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I DON'T APPRECIATE THE MISINFORMATION- CAMPAIGN THAT'S OUT THERE ANYWAY PRODUCTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE SOLD AS FOOD AND HAVE- NUTRITION FACT LABELS ON THE BACK OF PACKAGES SO THEY WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY AB THIRTEEN FORTY ONE IF THEY'RE BEING SOLD SPECIFICALLY AS DIET SUPPLEMENTS THEY WOULD BE COVERED OUT THERE BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THESE YOUNG. CHILDREN PIC THAT THESE HABITATS KIDS IN CARRY THEM INTO ADULTHOOD AND WE HAVE THEM FOR A LIFETIME NOT JUST THE BAD HABITS THAT AFFECT THE HEALTH PHYSICALLY BUT MENTALLY- AND WE HAVE SEEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC HAS GOTTEN WORSE FOR CHILDREN OUT THERE AS A BEING BOMBARDED WITH IMAGES ON A REGULAR BASIS AS THE FORTY FOUR YEAR OLD WOMAN. THOSE IDEAS STILL STIGMATIZED ARE STILL WITH ME TODAY AND SO WHILE WE WORK EVERY DAY TO BE THE STRONG WOMAN THAT WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO SEE S. VERY ALITY IS THAT WE NEVER STOP AT WORK AND SO THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE PHYSICAL HEALTH- AND COMMON SENSE BUT ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH ABOUT PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN OUT THERE AND SO I'M A LITTLE OFFENDED BY OUR FIRST WITNESS OUT THERE. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS FAIR I AND I AGREE WITH MS GONZALEZ THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING MORE BUT THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP.

RIGHT WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE A. B. TEN THIRTY THREE AM IS BARKING. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL ANYONE EXCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. TO THEIR PRESENT AB TEN THIRTY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE REMEDIATION BE THE FIRST STEP IN EMPLOYEE SMALL EMPLOYER DISAGREEMENTS ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE. SAVING TIME FOR QUICKER RESOLUTION AND MONEY ON COSTLY LITIGATION LAST YEAR WE PASSED SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE EXPANDED THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT SO THAT IT NOW APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WE JUST FIVE OR MORE EMPLOYEES. DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT COSTLY LITIGATION AND SMALL BUSINESSES ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW MANDATE THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH THE SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM IN BUDGET BILL AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. THE PROGRAM HAS A SUNSET DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WITH A DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING CHARGES BEEN FILED. FOR VIOLATION OF CIFRA AGAINST AN EMPLOYER WITH FIVE TO NINETEEN EMPLOYEES. THE EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYER WOULD NEED TO REQUEST MEDIATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF RECEIVING A COPY OF THE RIGHT TO SUE NOTICE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT EMPLOYERS DON'T RECEIVE A COPY OF THE RIGHT TO SUE NOTICE UNTIL AFTER LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED. UNDERMINING THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM. THIS IS FOR GOOD REASON WE DON'T WANT THE EMPLOYER TO RECEIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE NOTICE IF THE EMPLOYEE NEVER DECIDES TO FILE A LAWSUIT. AB TEN THIRTY THREE CORRECT THE ISSUE BY HAVING THE EMPLOYEE CONTACT DFG AGES MEDIATION PROGRAM. IF THEY DECIDE THEY DO WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE LAWSUIT. THE DFG H. WILL THEN CONTACT THE EMPLOYER TO ARRANGE MEDIATION WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS. IF BOTH PARTIES AGREE MEDIATION WOULD BE FRUITLESS THEY NEED NOT PARTICIPATE. SECONDLY THE BILL CLARIFIES EDIFICATION OF AND SUBJECT TO MEDIATION UNDER THE PROGRAM BUT WAS NOT THE EMPLOYER CAN. EIGHT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF ASHLEY HOFFMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN KEVIN MCCARTY WITH NFIB. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED IS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ACTUALLY HOFFMAN AND KEVIN PICTURE ID. THE SOFTWARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS WITH IS ACTUALLY HOFFMAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AT MOUNT SPONSOR AT EIGHTY AND THIRTY THREE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED- AT TEN THIRTY THREE CLEAN SEVEN ALREADY EXISTING MEDIATION PROGRAM AT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR WHEN SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WAS BEING DISCUSSED ABOUT EXPANDING CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT SMALL BUSINESSES WHO JUST FIVE EMPLOYEES THERE WAS SOME CONCERN ABOUT POTENTIAL LITIGATION AS A SMALL BUSINESSES LEARN TO IMPLEMENT THE FROCKS WHICH COMES WITH QUITE A BIT OF WINKING COMPLEX REGULATION AND- AN AGREEMENT WAS THEREFORE MADE TO CREATE THIS MEDIATION PROGRAM. THROUGH THE EIGHT UNDER THAT PROGRAM IF THEY SEE HER COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THE SMALL BUSINESS WITH FEWER THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES EITHER PARTY COULD REQUEST THE PARTY CERTAIN MEDIATE THE CLAIM. THAT THE FCC HAS GREAT MEDIATION PROGRAM OF THE ISSUE WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGES STATED IS THAT IN ORDER TO REQUEST MEDIATION THE EMPLOYER MUST REQUEST THAT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF RECEIVING A RIGHT TO SUE NOTICE. HOWEVER BECAUSE AN EMPLOYER IS NOT ACTUALLY SERVED WITH A COPY OF THAT OFTENTIMES THE PLAYERS DO NOT RECEIVE A COPY OR EVEN SEE IT UNTIL LITIGATION HAS STARTED OFTEN WELL AS THE DISCOVERY PROCESS. SO IN PRACTICE EMPLOYERS UNABLE TO UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM VIDEO FEEDS HAS CONFIRMED THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE SAYS WHERE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN USED AS FAR SINCE JANUARY FIRST IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE EMPLOYEE THAT HAS REQUESTED MEDIATION- EVEN TEN THIRTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS BY PROVIDING THAT WHEN AN EMPLOYEE DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD THE LAWSUIT THEY WILL CONTACT. THE AT THE AGES DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROGRAM THIS IS THE OFFICIAL THEN REACH OUT TO THE EMPLOYER AS LONG AS EITHER THE EMPLOYER OR THE EMPLOYEE DOES WANT MEDIATION I REQUEST THAT THE DFU TOOL THAN A RAIN CHECK. IF NEITHER PARTY REQUEST MEDIATION THE EMPLOYER. THREE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH FILING A LOT. THE BILL ALSO KERR THAT ATTACKING ERROR FROM A SPEAKER EIGHTY LAST YEAR. BY ADDING PAYER IN LAW. I SECRET A FAMILY MEMBER THAT EMPLOYEE CAN QUICKLY TO CARE. I WE JUST WANT TO THANK THE- ARE. AND THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AS FEEL AS LEGAL AID AT WORK AND THAT APART APPARENTLY HOW- ALL OF US. HAVE HAD AT OF MEETINGS TRY TO. WORK THIS BILL INTO A IT IS TO MAKE IT BETTER FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND- I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. YOU MAY ABOUT THE EVENT- THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS THE EFFORTS. TODAY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR DROPPING. YES HI GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- KEVIN MCCARTY ON BEHALF OF NFIB. WE REPRESENT- PROXIMALLY FIFTEEN THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY SMALL BUSINESSES ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM THE RESULT OF COBIT. SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HUMAN RESOURCE PERSONNEL OR LEGAL COUNSEL IN THE SAME WAY OTHER LARGE BUSINESSES. IN THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT WAS EXPANDED LAST YEAR. SMALL BUSINESSES HAD TO LEARN A NEW COMPLEX SET OF REGULATIONS ON HOW TO PROPERLY ADMINISTER. TRACK AND DOCUMENT THAT LEAVE. DUE TO THE HIGH RISK OF INADVERTENT ERRORS THAT CAN BE MADE A SMALL EMPLOYERS LEARN THIS NEW LEAVE PROGRAM. AND THE FINANCIAL IMPACT. EVEN ONE LAWSUIT CAN HAVE ON A BUSINESS. THE SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PROGRAM. IS IMPORTANT TO THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AB TEN THIRTY THREE ENSURES EMPLOYERS ARE ACTUALLY ABLETO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM BY FIXING THE WAY THAT THE MEDIATION IS INITIATED UNDER THE PROGRAM. WE OCCURRED YOUR SUPPORT OF AB TEN THIRTY THREE AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

I'LL BE SUPPORTING THANK YOU MR GALLAGHER IS DAVIES THANK YOU I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR MUCH YOU KNOW FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND- AND- YOU KNOW THE- DEVASTATION THEY FELT FOR THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF.

GALLAGHER AYE CHAU CHIU DAVIES DAVEY SECOND SALAS DOLLARS AYE HOLDEN KALRA. OVER AYE KILEY KELLY I MAIENSCHEIN REYES. THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM I WERE ITEM NUMBER. TWO EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE. HI THERE. GOOD MORNING THIS CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LET ME BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON AMENDMENTS WHICH I'LL BE. ACCEPTING THIS MORNING THANK YOU AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE WILL MAKE INVALID ANY DENSITY RESTRICTION AND PRIVATE COVENANTS THAT DO NOT ALIGN WITH CURRENT LOCAL ZONING. PRIVATE COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS ATTACHED TO A PROPERTY AND REMAIN ENFORCEABLE EVEN AFTER THE PROPERTY IS SOLD. WHAT WE ALL KNOW THAT UNTIL THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY RACIAL RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS WERE USED TO REDLINE AND SEGREGATE NEIGHBORHOODS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS SINCE MADE RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE HOWEVER THESE COVENANTS OFTEN CONTAIN OTHER VESTIGES OF DISCRIMINATION SUCH AS LIMITS. ON THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF UNITS THAT CAN BE BUILT. THE RESTRICTIONS IN THESE COVENANTS ARE OFTENTIMES IN CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ALLOW FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AND DESPITE THEIR DISCRIMINATORY ORIGIN AND CLEAR CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING LAWS THESE RESTRICTIONS REMAIN ENFORCEABLE AGAINST AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER WHICH BRINGS US TO THIS BILL. THREATS OF LAWSUITS OVER THESE COVENANTS MAKE IT DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO GET TITLE INSURANCE COVERAGE AND FUNDING FROM LENDERS. THE TIME AND EXPENSE NEEDED TO REMOVE THE COVENANTS DETERRED DEVELOPERS FROM DEVELOPING ON THESE OTHERWISE IDEAL PROJECT SITES AND SO UNDER AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS WHO NO LONGER RESIDE ON THE PROPERTY. CANNOT USE COVENANTS TO CURTAIL MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. THIS MEASURE CLARIFIES THAT DENSITY RESTRICTIONS AND PRIVATE COVENANTS ARE UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST A 1100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE ALSO PRESERVES AND STRENGTHENS LOCAL CONTROL BY INVALIDATING RESTRICTIONS THAT CONFLICT WITH LOCAL ZONING. AB SEVEN TWENTY ONE IS A MUCH NEEDED MEASURE TO REMOVE UNNECESSARY BARRIERS IN OUR EFFORTS IN TACKLING THE HOUSING CRISIS I HAVE VOTE. TESTIFYING ON THE BILL TODAY TARA BEROSSUS WITH THE COMMUNITY CORPORATION OF SANTA MONICA AND BRANDON YEAH WITH PUBLIC COUNCIL THANK YOU I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES INDICATED HERE BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. TEREBRA ASK US ARE YOU WITH US. MORNING HONORABLE KAREN MEMBERS MINING HARDWARE OUT THIS AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY CORPORATE SANTA MONICA BERMAN THANK NONPROFIT THAT IS OPERATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE AFFLUENT WEST SIDE OF LA COUNTY FOR ALMOST FORTY YEARS. I'D LIKE TO START BY THINKING ASSEMBLYMEMBER RICHARD BLOOM FOR CHAMPIONING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MANY YEARS WE ARE HERE TODAY THE CO SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE BECAUSE OF THE PORTABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO SHARE WITH POLICY MAKERS THE OBSTACLES WE FACE IN THE HOPES THEY CAN BE FIXED. THE ISSUES RAISED BY EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PERPETUATE HISTORICAL SEGREGATION OF NEIGHBORHOODS ASKING FOR ABOUT HOUSING DEVELOPER ACTING RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WITH ITS EXTREMELY UPSETTING RACIAL PROVISIONS ALONG WITH ACCOMPANYING DENSITY RESTRICTIONS MULTIPLE TIMES USUALLY HAVE CHOSEN TO WALK AWAY FROM THOSE PROJECTS BUT AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE PAST YEAR I FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT CHALLENGES STATUS QUO AND TAKE AWAY THE POWER THAT THE SEGREGATIONIST COVENANTS THE PAD. TO REMOVE SUCH PRESIDENT CAN COST A LOT OF MONEY AND THEN EXTENDED COURT PROCESS AND FOR PROPERTIES ALREADY THE OWNER DESIGNATED FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT IN ONE PROJECT WE'RE WORKING ON CURRENTLY THE PROPERTIES DESIGNATED MULTI FAMILY BY THE CITY AND THE ONLY THING STANDING IN THE WAY IS THIS PRIVATE OUTDATED COVENANT AMONGST OWNERS FROM THE NINETEEN FORTIES. WHICH PROHIBITS MULTI FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS IT WOULD PROVIDE OVER A HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A COMMUNITY THAT HAS NO AFFORDABLE HOUSING YOU TOO MANY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS RECORDED IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD. WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE ARE COSPONSORED PUBLIC COUNCIL WHO EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT THE COVENANTS AND IT'S WORKED VERY HARD TO HELP US THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE BUILT WE CAN'T BEGIN TO ADDRESS EXCLUSIONARY NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT ADDRESSING RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL AND SEGREGATIONIST. PRACTICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THEN BRENT PATH. THE BOSTON MEMBERS MY NAME PLANET HEY I'M STAFF OF TEN WITH PUBLIC COUNCIL THE NATION LARGEST BONO FIRM MY WORK FOCUSES ON A HOUSE INCREASE DEVELOPMENT I WANT TO FIRST THANK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CAREFUL ATTENTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE QUESTION OF WHERE DENSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN AND SHOULD BE BUILT ITS SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL BUT THE DECISION SHOULD BE MADE BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW AND INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNERS NOT OPENLY RACIST DEVELOPERS FROM THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND THIRTIES. MANY PEOPLE ARE. WITH THE HISTORY OF RACIALLY RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS THAT WERE DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT PEOPLE OF COLOR FROM LIVING AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOODS. UNFORTUNATELY THE LEGACY OF THOSE RACES RESTRICTION CALLICOTT. RECORDED RESTRICTIONS THAT LIMIT DEVELOPMENT ON A GIVEN PARKS UP TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS OR TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF BUILDINGS. ARE OFTEN TREATED AS ENFORCEABLE TODAY. EVEN IF THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE MORE LIMITING THAN THE APPLICABLES RUNNING CODE. BY LAND USE RULES AND EVEN THOSE RESTRICTIONS ARE CONTAINED IN THE SAME DOCUMENT. THAT EXPLICITLY RACIST RESTRICTIONS ON WHO MAY LIVE THERE. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE WOULD MAKE THE PRIVATE AND THE RESTRICTIONS IN RECORDED COVENANTS UNENFORCEABLE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT. YEAH BY REMOVING A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE. IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HIS HAVE HISTORICALLY EXCLUDED THEM. JUST LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MODIFY EXPLICITLY BASIS RESTRICTION. EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE IT'S NOT THE NEAR IDENTICAL PROCESS OF MODIFYING. ITS PRIVATE DENSITY DESTRUCTION. IMPORTANTLY THE BILL WOULDN'T MAKE ME WOULD EVER. ANY CHANGE TO LOCAL CODE BY MAN USE RULES. IT WOULD SIMPLY ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO BUILD MUCH AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON A GIVEN PROPERTY AT THE APPLICABLES ONLY CODE WOULD ALLOW. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL DOES NOT DO AWAY WITH RESTRICTIVE COVENANT ENTIRELY. ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PROPERTY NOT RELATED TO THE SITE LOCATION OR NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE BUILT THERE WOULD REMAIN FULLY ENFORCEABLE. AND EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE EXPLICITLY ALLOWS THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO RETAIN ITS CHARACTER BY ENFORCING DESIGNED AND AESTHETICALLY STRINGENT OR BY INPUTTING MAINTENANCE FEES TO KEEP COMMON AREAS IN GOOD REPAIR. ON BEHALF OF PUBLIC COUNCIL IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE ON EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE. TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS OF RECTIFYING THE HARM OF CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION. AND DISCRIMINATORY. HOUSING POLICIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE.

I THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK ON THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS VETERAN ALICE'S SON OUR CONCERNS. REGARDING THE THREAT THAT EIGHTY SEVEN TWENTY ONE POSES TO CONSERVATION EASEMENTS. BACK CALIFORNIA FIRST ESTABLISH THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CONSERVATION EASEMENT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. CALIFORNIA HAS SINCE RELIED. UPON IT IS GOING TO CONSERVE THE ENVIRONMENT. WHEN PROTECTED BY. EASEMENTS TIRING READ. DISAPPEARING SACRED COMMENDED BE. AND REVERSING BECAUSE I HABITAT NEEDED FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES THREATENED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. CONSERVATION AND CONSERVATION EASEMENTS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A VITAL TOOL MEETING MANY OF THE STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY RESTORATION GOALS. HE KILLED HIS MEMBER LAND TRUSTS OTHER NONPROFITS PURCHASE CONSERVATION EASEMENT. INSURED WILL CONTRIBUTIONS OR CHOIR IN PUBLIC FUNDING FOR LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS FOR COMBINATION THERAPY. YOU KNOW IN THE PUBLIC DOLLARS TO THE SECURING THE CONSERVATION LAND. I RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE LANDS PUBLIC MONEY ALSO FUND CONSERVATION EASEMENTS YOUR FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION SPECTATE TAX CREDIT. THOSE FEDERAL TAX DEDUCTION LIMIT IRAQI INTERPRETATION OF THIS BILL WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE US CONCERN. WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE IRAQIS INTERPRETATION WILL LEAD THEM TO DECLARE THAT THE BILL NULLIFIES PUT AT THE PETROL NATURE CONSERVATION IS NOT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT CONSERVATION EASEMENT TO BE VALID MUST BE IN PERPETUITY. AND THAT THE IRS IS MADE THEN SHE TO REMOVE THE LANDOWNERS TAX DEDUCTION AND POTENTIALLY IN LINE THE ENTIRE EASEMENT. IN ADDITION WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT THIS MAY HAVE ON LANDOWNERS. AND WILLINGNESS TO ENTER INTO CONSERVATION EASEMENT. MANY OF OUR MEMBER LAND TRUSTS ASK THAT LANDOWNERS DONATE A PORTION OF THE EASEMENT. TO BRING DOWN THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THEN YOUR THREAT OF A TAX DEDUCTION NOT BEEN MAINTAINED IS ENOUGH TO DETER MANY LANDOWNERS. THAT SAID WE'RE REALLY ENCOURAGED BY THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS TO DATE. I MEAN MANAGE PROPOSED HERE TODAY BY THE COMMITTEE.

INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF LITIGATION AND- INHIBIT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE- TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT THE BILL- SEEKING TO PROMOTE- WE- WE'RE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING- SIMPLE AMENDMENT- TO REQUIRE THE RECORDING OF THE- MODIFICATION FOR- WE THINK- IT'LL REMOVE AMBIGUITY FROM REAL PROPERTY RECORDS- REDUCE LIKELIHOOD OF LITIGATION AND- BETTER ENABLE TITLE COMPANY PARTICIPATION ON THESE PROJECTS. WE DO NOT THINK THIS IS AN ONEROUSREQUIREMENTS- RECORDING FORMS IS SIMPLE IT'S INEXPENSIVE. SOMETHING THAT DEVELOPERS ALREADY HAVE TO DO DURING THE COURSE OF DEVELOPING GIVEN PROJECT- WE THINK IT'S A WORTHY STEP TO TAKE GIVEN THE BENEFIT THAT WE THINK IT CONFERS- SO WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- AUTHORS- OFFICE AND THE SPONSOR AND- WHAT WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS AND REMOVE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

CURRENTLY THE FUND MAKES INVESTMENTS BY PAIN OUTSIDE FUND MANAGERS TO MANAGE THE TRANSACTIONS.

THANK YOU I'M LOOKING FOR MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS. ALL RIGHT MISS COOPER SING THE MOTION WILL TAKE THIS UP. WE GET MORE MEMBERS HERE OKAY THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'LL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE MR GABRIEL SB. FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN. NOT AT THIS TIME. GO AHEAD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ALARMED ABOUT THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES AND MODERATING OUR PUBLIC DISCOURSE FOR MANY PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE HORRIFIC ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY AT THE US CAPITOL EARLIER THIS YEAR THESE CONCERNS CENTER AROUND THE ROLE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS PLAY IN PROMOTING HATE SPEECH DISINFORMATION CONSPIRACY THEORIES. AND VIOLENT EXTREMISM. FOR OTHERS IT IS THE MYSTERY BEHIND WHY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS IN CONTENT AND NOT OTHERS ARE SUBJECT TO DISCIPLINARY ACTION. ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE THERE IS GROWING CONCERN ABOUT SEVEREPOLITICAL POLARIZATION AND THE ABILITY OF A HANDFUL OF COMPANIES TO PROFOUNDLY SHAPE THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE THAT IS CENTRAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AB FIVE EIGHTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THESE CONCERNS BY REQUIRING SOCIAL MEDIA COMPANIES TO SHARE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CONTENT MODERATION PRACTICES WITH CONSUMERS. IN PARTICULAR THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE LARGEST AND MOST SOPHISTICATED PLATFORMS TO DISCLOSE. THEIR CONTENT MODERATION POLICIES. HOW THOSE POLICIES ARE ENFORCED AND KEY METRICS AND DATA AROUND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THOSE POLICIES. TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THESE COMPANIES TO HAVE ANY SPECIFIC POLICIES. NOR DOES IT REQUIRE THEM TO UNDERTAKE ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT. IT SIMPLY REQUIRES THEM TO BE OPEN AND TRANSPARENT WITH POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT. IF ANYTHING THEY'RE DOING TO MODERATE SPEECH ON THEIR PLATFORMS. THIS NARROW PRESSURE SPECS THE FIRST AMENDMENT FEDERAL PREEMPTION WELL AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING MEANINGFUL TRANSPARENCY AND MUCH NEEDED PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. IN SHORT THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS TO COME CLEAN ABOUT HOW THEY ARE MODERATING CONTENT. SO THAT WE CAN ALL BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARE AMPLIFYING CERTAIN VOICES AND SILENCING OTHERS. THE PUBLIC AND POLICY MAKERS DESERVE NO LESS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT WE APPRECIATE SEVERAL THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION'S. THE AMENDMENT WE ARE TAKING TODAY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO MY WITNESS LEARN CRAP FROM THE ANTI DEFAMATION LEAGUE. I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE STAFFER THEIR SYSTEMS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHORS OF ELEMENTS THAT ARE CORRECTED THANK YOU VERY GOOD. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION. AND A SECOND AND WILL MOVE TO.

THIS INFORMATION IS SENSITIVE AND PROVIDES ABOUT ACTORS WITH DETAILS ABOUT OUR CAPABILITIES AND BEST PRACTICES THIS IS ALSO WHY OUR CONCERNS ARE HEIGHTENED.

GOOD MORNING TAMMY MARTIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT AND GOALS AND WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH AUTHOR HONEST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU WILL KILL MEMBERS CONTRACTED WORK. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MCCALLUM MCCALLUM MEDDLESOME TRANSCRIBER I AM SUPPORTING THE BILL GOT YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THEN WE WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS OF THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE. YES A GOOD MORNING- CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MATTHEW MCREYNOLDS SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE PACIFIC JUSTICE INSTITUTE CENTER FOR PUBLIC POLICY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THAT WE'RE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IS CONCERNED WITH WHERE THIS WOULD TAKE THE UNRUH CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AT YOU TO THIS POINT OUR LANDMARK CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS FOCUSED ON DENIAL OF SERVICES- AS WELL AS COMBINATIONS AND PRIVILEGES. IN BUSINESS ESTABLISHMENTS THIS BILL WOULD DO SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THAN THAT THIS WOULD TAKE THE ANDREW ACT IN A DIRECTION WHERE SIGNIFICANT FINES AND ATTORNEY'S FEES COULD ACCRUE NOT BECAUSE ANYONE IS DENIED A SERVICE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE. THE GOODS THAT THEY SEEK WAR TO ENTER THE ESTABLISHMENT THAT THEY SEEK ISAAC COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING WHAT THIS WOULD DO. IS TAKE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT A DIRECTION WHERE- BY CUSTOMERS SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE STORES LAID. WOULD SUBJECT THAT STORE TOO ONEROUS PENALTIES AND FINES AND NOW WE SEE THAT EVEN THE AND NOTICED PROVISION OPPORTUNITY. CURE HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM THE BILL. SECONDLY HOW WE JUST OUT THE US SUPREME ADDRESS. A VERY SIMILAR ISSUE TEN YEARS AGO WHEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAD TRIED TO HELP PARENTS- QUOTE UNQUOTE BY RESTRICTING ACCESS TO VIDEO GAMES. AND THE US SUPREME COURT IN BROWN VERSUS OUR TEAM EMERGENCY SATIATION STRUCK DOWN THAT ATTEMPT AND NOTED THAT PARENTS DON'T NEED THE HELP OF THE LEGISLATURE TO PICK OUT APPROPRIATE TOYS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THERE'S NO LIMITING PRINCIPLE IN THIS BILL SO- ONE CAN ONLY GUESS WHERE IT'LL THE NEXT ALTHOUGH AS ONE OF THE SUPPORTING WITNESSES JUST NOTED- SOME IN SUPPORT. WHICH SUGGESTS THAT EVEN TELLING KIDS TO FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS IS DISCRIMINATORY AND STEREOTYPICAL AND NEEDS TO BE ELIMINATED SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS- AND OTHERS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU THIRTY ONE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR. SAY NOT ABOUT THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM WHERE THE REMOTE TESTIMONY SAY. SAY NOT RIGHT OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT SHORE IN Q. IT'LL JUST BE ONE MOMENT FOR THE FIRST COMMENT THANK YOU. I WILL GO TO ONE SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY CLOSE ALLIANCE I DON'T BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GONZALEZ I DON'T LIKE WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS BILL I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED IN MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME. IT WOULD SEEM JUST. AS SOMEBODY WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME AND CHILDREN'S DEPARTMENTS THAT- A LOT ESPECIALLY THAT EIGHT YEAR OLD WHO JUST CALLED AND I'M THINKING OF THAT EIGHT YEAR OLD. IS THERE A REASON THE GENDER NEUTRAL SEEMS I GET IT. BUT IS THERE A REASON WE'RE JUST NOT. REQUIRING A COMBINATION OF KIDS. CLOTHES KIDS. TOYS WITHOUT DESIGNATION BECAUSE I THINK. THE TOP FIRST STEP- AND HAVING. HAD DIFFERENT CHILDREN CHOOSE DIFFERENT THINGS TO WEAR. THE. THE GENDER NEUTRAL TENDS TO BE BOYS YEAH BOYISH CLOTHES FOR GIRLS RIGHT- TRYING TO SATISFY- FOR EXAMPLE A BOY WHO WANTS TO WEAR- CLOSE THAT ARE LABELED AS GIRLS WHETHER IT BE. KEEN SURE OR DRESS THAT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE SIGNAGE AND BECAUSE OF THE EXPECTATION SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW YOU LIKE IT IS THIS A ONE STOP APPROACH OR OR ARE WE- IT JUST SEEMS TO ME I JUST WAS LIKE LET'S GET RID OF LABELS AND WHY WERE ADDED. JUST TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE- STANDARDIZING SIZES BETWEEN AT BOYS AND GIRLS CLOTHES AND SHOES IS A KEY COMPONENT OF ALL OF THIS BEING ABLE TO KIND OF WEAR WHAT YOU WANT AND FOR PARENTS TO BE ABLE TO SHOP ACCORDINGLY JUST A SUGGESTION FOR IT MAYBE FUTURE LEGISLATION BUT I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS AND- CREATING A GENDER NEUTRAL CATEGORY RATHER THAN JUST SAYING LET'S GET RID OF. THE BOYS AND GIRLS I'LL- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF SOMEONE AT. AS YOU MAY KNOW I SPENT IT- QUITE SOME TIME MEETING WITH THE RETAILERS AND LEARNING ABOUT. AND HEARING FROM DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES IN THE- NUANCE ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD ORGANIZED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. OF WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD LIKE TO GO TO IN THE SPIRIT AND INTENT. OF WHAT YOU'RE DISCUSSING- BUT THE BILL THAT WE HAVE IS TRYING TO NOT BE SO PRESCRIPTIVE TO ALLOW FOR. THE RETAILERS TO DO WHAT THEY ALREADY ARE DOING- THE BILL BEFORE US DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. THIS APPLIES TO FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OR MORE THERE ARE DOING IT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFEEN. SO THEY TEND TO TRY TO NOT BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE BUT I SHARE WITH YOU THE DESIRE THAT YOU HAVE SPECIFICALLY. I'M JUST ALLOWING FOR THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE CONSUMER TO MAKE THE CHOICE ACCORDINGLY AND AN ORGANIZED FASHION SO I SHARE THAT- BUT- THE BILL BEFORE SO IS TO TRY TO ATTEMPT TO NOT BE. TOO PRESCRIPTIVE AND JUST ALLOW FOR THE INDIVIDUAL RETAILER TO ORGANIZE ACCORDINGLY AS WE SEEK TO SELF IT. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS CURRENT.

HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. WHICH TOTALED OVER HALF OF OUR NATION UNSHELTERED POPULATION. RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO HOMELESSNESS REQUIRES A COMBINATION OF STRATEGIES PREVENTING OR DIVERTING PEOPLE FROM EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHENEVER POSSIBLE ENSURING PEOPLE HAVE. TRANSITION RAPIDLY FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HOUSING AND SERVICES AND PROVIDING IMMEDIATE LOW BARRIER SHELTER OPTIONS TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WHO CAN NOT IMMEDIATELY ACCESS.

CONSULT AYE HOLDEN ALL RIGT KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY I'D MAIENSCHEIN REYES RECYCLING. THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU THANKS JOHN THANK YOU RATES I REMEMBER SEVEN WILL GO TO MISS GONZALEZ AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. OKAY SO YOU'RE GONNA PRESENT ALSO A. B. FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. OKAY SO- YOU COULD. TAKE WHICHEVER ONE YOU LIKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN BEGINS TO ADDRESS LONG STANDING ISSUES IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT INDUSTRY THROUGH THE CREATION OF A STATE WIDE FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL BY HOLDING EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR PROTECTING THEIR WORKERS WHEN KNOWLEDGE THE ANALYSIS AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR ALWAYS SAYING WHATEVER WORKER. IT TRYING TO MAKE LAWS TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITIONS ARE IN THE WAR STATE POSSIBLE AND I AGREE ALL LOW WAGE WORKERS. ACTUALLY FACE THESE ISSUES ON THE JOB AT THIS PARTICULARLY DEALS WITH FAST FOOD WORKERS. WHO ALSO HAVE. THESE CHALLENGES- IN THE SAME DEGREE AS OTHER VERY LOW WAGE SERVICE WORKERS. DESPITE WORKING THE FASTEST GROWING SECTOR IN THE STATE FAST FOOD WORKERS EXPERIENCE SOME OF THE LOWEST WAGES. SOME OF THE LOWEST WAGES ALONG WITH WAGE THEFT HARASSMENT UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS. THE PANDEMIC IS ONLY FURTHER MAGNIFIED THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. WITH THE NUMEROUS FROM KOBE NINETEEN NUMBERS LAWS AND REGULATIONS WERE. INSTITUTED TO TRY TO PROTECT WORKERS FROM INFECTION AND ALLOW THEM TO STAY SAFE AND RECOVER WITHOUT FEAR OF LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOODS. HOWEVER EMPLOYERS HAVE FAILED TO INFORM THEIR WORKERS ABOUT THESE RIGHT TO PRESSURE EMPLOYEES TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WORKING IN UNSAFE CONDITIONS LOSING THEIR LIVELIHOODS. WORKERS HAVE FAILED NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS DOCUMENTED VIOLATIONS OF COVERT SAFETY MEASURES PUBLIC HEALTH LAWS AND LABOR LAWS AND THEY'RE WINNING THEM. IN ONE NOTABLE EXAMPLE OF FAST FOOD FRANCHISEE IN LOS ANGELES ILLEGALLY FIRED FOUR EMPLOYEES WHO PROTESTED WORKPLACE CONDITIONS OR UNSAFE. FOR MANAGING THE SPREAD CODED. WE KNOW THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER WITH CO ED AND OBVIOUSLY OUR RATES ARE ARE EXTREMELY LOW OW THANK GOD- BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CONDITIONS IN THE FAST FOOD INDUSTRY UNFORTUNATELY. AT IT WE NEED TO CREATE A NEW NORMAL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE INEQUITIES THAT WE SAW THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THAT WERE- AMPLIFIED DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THAT COMING OUT THE PANDEMIC WE SAID WE WOULD DO BETTER BY WORKERS THIS IS ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS. BY FAR THESE WORKERS HAVE BEEN ESSENTIAL FRONTLINE WORKERS HAVE CONTINUED TO FEED US. DESPITE BEING IN CONDITIONS THAT WERE LEFT LARGELY UNSAFE ARE OFTEN AND SAFE. AND- BEING LOW PAID. BUT THIS. BILL WILL ALLOW THEM TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB WILL PROTECT THEM FROM RETALIATION BY UTILIZING- THE TYPE OF LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN CREATED OR THEY WILL CREATE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE SAFETY AND GOOD WORKING CONDITIONS. AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE- AN INDUSTRY THAT IS NOT SMALL BUSINESSES BUT IN FACT IS OPERATED BY LARGE BILLIONAIRE CORPORATIONS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO WITH THIS AND WE HOPE TO GIVE WORKERS A MEANINGFUL VOICE ON THE JOB IN A WAY THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS INDUSTRY. I WITNESSES HERE INCLUDING A FAST FOOD WORKER FROM SAN JOSE MEDIA RELEASE. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND EMILY THERE ARE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN.

HI GOOD MORNING- MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JUAN CARLOS CHACON I AM THE PRESIDENT EXTEND DINING GROUP OF FRENCH IDEA OF CARE YOU MIKE SUBS AND LOS ANGELES. WE OWN AND OPERATE SIX RESTAURANTS. AND NOW LOS ANGELES AND WE IMPLORE A ROUGHLY SIXTY FIVE EMPLOYEES. CALIFORNIANS AB TWENTY SEVEN WILL DESTROY A SUCCESSFUL MODEL BUSINESS OWNERSHIP CORRECT OUTLOOK CALIFORNIA. I AM A FIRST GENERATION SALVADORAN MY PARENTS BOTH WERE BORN AND RAISED IN EL SALVADOR MY BROTHER WAS BORN AND RAISED UP A LITTLE. BIT MORE OF THE UNITED STATES TO GIVE MYSELF MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER A BETTER OPPORTUNITY. I STARTED WITH DOMINO'S PIZZA IN TWO THOUSAND. AS A REGULAR TEAM MEMBER STARTING WITH AN OPPORTUNITY I GREW TO A SYSTEM MANAGER A GENERAL MANAGER. A DISTRICT MANAGER A DIRECTOR. AND B. CAN EVENTUALLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. FRANCHISEE I LEFT ALMOST BEAT THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. GO UP FOR A BETTER OPPORTUNITY WHICH MIKE'S FEDERAL JERKING MIKEY TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS TOOK TO GET MULTIPLE LOCATIONS. WITH THAT OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE TO A BRAND THAT WOULD SUPPORT ME AND MY GOALS AND MY DREAMS TO BECOME A BUSINESS OWNER AND A MULTISTORY UNIT OPERATOR. I'VE GONE FROM ONE TO THREE. FIVE SIX. ALL WITHOUT GIVING OPPORTUNITIES TO SEVERAL ENTRY LEVEL EMPLOYEES. GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GENERAL MANAGER TO THE REGULAR ENTRY LEVEL EMPLOYEES TO GENTLE MANNER JUST TO SUPPORTING THEIR FAMILY. CREATING ANOTHER INCOME FOR THEM TO BUY THEIR- THEIR FIRST HOME. IN THE BUDGET SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. AND ALL MY OPPORTUNITY WAS THE BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM THAT SUPPORT. DURING DURING THE PANDEMIC A LOT OF US IT WAS ALL NEW WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE END RESOURCES SUCH AT PPP WAS NOT M. AVAILABLE TO WHAT. THE MEDIA LEE AS A WHAT SCARES STEVEN HOSPITALS ONCE IT WAS MADE AVAILABLE WE CALLED ALL AT CDC AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- REGULATIONS TO KEEP TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ALL MY EMPLOYEES AND INCLUDING MYSELF. THERE'S NOT ONE DAY THAT I STOPPED GOING TO LOCATIONS IN THE RESTAURANTS TO SUPPORT MY EMPLOYEES AND THE SERVICE THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND ALL MY CUSTOMERS THAT WANTED TO EAT THERE- RECENT. STATISTICS SHOW GROWING NUMBERS OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES OWNING FRANCHISEE FRANCHISE THAT WAS MEANT. AND AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN WHAT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THE OWNERSHIP. OF THESE BUSINESSES AND THE DREAMS OF PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF TO OWN MY OWN BUSINESS. IN REALITY AS A FRANCHISEE IAM THE LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OPERATING UNDER A NATIONAL BRAND OR IDENTITY SIMILAR TO OTHER NON FRANCHISED SMALL BUSINESSES. AS A LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER IS IN CHARGE OF ALL THE DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS HIRING FIRING WAGES AND BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS IN MY RESTAURANTS ARE LEFT TO ME. IT IS THE LOCAL FRANCHISEE WHO OWNS AND OPERATES YOUR TABLETS MEANT NOT THE FRANCHISE OR- AB FIFTY SEVEN WILL IMPOSE- UP. UP HER FIRST STATE LIABILITY ROLE ON FRENCH REYES DOORS. THAT HAVE NO ROLE WHATSOEVER INDIA TO THE DRAFTING LEGISLATION AND LOCAL LOCAL LEGISLATION AND STATE LEGISLATION UNDER AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. I COULD BE REDUCED TO MORE OF A MIDDLE MANAGER ROLE WITH MY FRANCHISE OR TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS. AND THAT WOULD BE A GREAT. MIKE EXCEPT FOR KIDS TO HELP ALBIA MANAGERS AND EMPLOYEES THAT WORK FOR ME. I'M NOT COMPLY WITH EVERY ASPECT OF CALIFORNIA LAW RELATING TO WAGES BENEFITS HOURS. WORKING CONDITIONS AND WORKER AND WORK WORKER SAFETY. THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE NEEDS FROM INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNER TO CORPORATE MATT MIDDLE MANAGER DESTROYING THE VERY BEST YET I HAVE WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD AND SO SEVERELY RESTRICTED THE ABILITY. YOUR ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN SMALL BUSINESS SIR I NEED YOU I WANTED LEASE. OKAY THE BILL ALSO CREATES A FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL WHICH WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO YOU TO ISSUE ENTIRELY NEW AND DIFFERENT LABOR. LABOR EMPLOYMENT WAGE AND HOUR AND HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS THAT APPLY EXCLUSIVELY TO FAST FOOD CHAIN THESE ARE DECISIONS I ALREADY MAKE EVERY DAY AND I AM VERY. AND ALREADY SUBJECT TO FEDERAL STATE AND COUNTY LAW. WHY WOULD A LEGISLATOR GIVE US. GIVE UP ITS ABILITY TO UNELECTED BOARD TO MAKE THAT DECISION SIR I NEED TO WRAP UP PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. RED MAKAYLA MENDELSSOHN. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM MCCARTY ELEMENTAL SENSE NAY TRANSGENDER BUSINESSWOMAN AND CEO OF POOR WEST CORP A MULTI UNIT FRANCHISEE PROFILE LOCAL RESTAURANTS IN THE WESTERN REGION WE EMPLOY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE IN OUR RESTAURANTS AND I AM A LONG TIME MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. I ALSO SIT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MAYOR GARCETTI'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WAS VOTED THE FACE OF THE PERSON EIGHT FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE NATIONAL RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES. I AM STRONGLY OPPOSED. TO AB TWO FIVE SEVEN WHICH TARGETS QUICK SERVICE AND FAST CASUAL RESTAURANTS UNDER BROWN WITH THIRTY MORRIS. STORES NATIONWIDE I TRULY FEEL FOR THIS EMPLOYEE FROM SAN JOSE WHO SPOKE EARLIER. ANTILLON SITUATIONS LIKE THIS THEY SHOULD TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF OUR FRIENDS AT THE DLPH IS PROTECTIONS AND THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM WHICH IS VERY STRONG IN CALIFORNIA. I KNOW IN OUR OWN STORES WE FOLLOW VERY STRICT COOPER NINETEEN PROTOCOLS AND TRACED EACH CASE AND NOT ONE EMPLOYEE. WHO HAD COVERED NINETEEN WHICH WERE QUARANTINE PROPERLY- NONE- NO CASES CAME FROM INFECTIONS WITHIN OUR RESTAURANTS WELL FROM THE OUTSIDE. THIS BILL IS AN ALARMING PROPOSAL TO EMPOWER NEW UNELECTED BODY THE FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL ESTABLISHED BY THE BILL DOES THAT WAGE AND WORKPLACE REQUIREMENTS FOR RESTAURANTS. SETTING WAGE WORKPLACE STANDARDS AS WE KNOW IS AN AUTHORITY CURRENTLY RESERVED FOR THE LEGISLATURE THE FORCE MY COMING FROM THE APPROPRIATE STATE AND LOCAL ANY CHARGE FOR DOING SO. AB TWO FIVE SEVEN INTENSELY HANDS LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY OVER TO AFFECTED COUNCIL HAS ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY TO VOTERS AND THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPOSE LABOR EMPLOYMENT POLICIES THAT SUPERSEDE THOSE BEING MADE BY ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE OTHER PORTION DEVELOP TAX RESTAURANT FRANCHISE MODEL. TURNING THAT MODEL ON ITS HEAD AB TWO FIVE SEVEN SIX THOSE TABLETS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY OF FRANCHISE STORES BY COUNTY MAKE FRENCH RESORTS. THE JOINT EMPLOYER FRANCHISEES ADVOCATE IT IS CHANGED ENACT EARLY TO PICK OWNERS OF THE FRANCHISE BRANDS THE FRANCHISE STORES THAT THE TWO OPERATORS OF THE STORES. NOTHING COULD BE MORE FALSE IN REALITY FRANCHISED OFFICES LIKE MINE UP AND DOWN THE STATE OR LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESSES LOCALLY ON BUSINESSES OPERATING UNDER A NATIONAL BRAND OR IDENTITY AB TWO FIVE SEVEN RESULT IN ME AND SO MANY OTHER FRANCHISEES. LOSING OUR TOP ICONOMI SINCE THE DAY WAS SENT TO BE STRIPPING US OF OUR DONE THE IT'S BUSINESS OWNERS AND MAKING US BASICALLY. EMPLOYEES FOR LARGE CORPORATIONS. THE EXISTING MY FRIEND MOUNT. GAVE ME THE OPTION TO PUT MY EARNED. INTO MY FIRST RESTAURANT OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO. JOINT LIABILITY WOULD REMOVE FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION THE INCENTIVE FOR FRANCHISE STORES TO DO BUSINESS WITH ANYONE OF THE LARGE CORPORATE CONGLOMERATES. EMPLOYED AT MY RESTAURANT TO BENEFITTED GREATLY FROM MY BILLION OPERATE WITHIN THE EXISTING MODEL AND THE SUPPORT RECEIVED TO GROW AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILIES- TO MY OWN SUCCESS AS A TRANSGENDER WOMAN IN THE FRANCHISE. I'M ABLE TO GIVE BACK ADVOCATING FOR TRANS AND NON BINARY INDIVIDUALS IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS THROUGH MY WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION AND IS THE FOUNDER OF TRANCE CAN WORK WHICH CREATES MODELS FOR TRANSPLANTS OF WORKPLACES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND ASSIST CORPORATION AND DIVERSIFYING THE WORKFORCE. THIS IS THE FIRST EFFORT OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION. AS WE ARE ALL AWARE THE FRENCH RESTAURANT FRANCHISE MODEL IS ONE MADE UP OF AMAZING STORIES OPPORTUNITY AND WONDERFUL REFLECTION OF THE GREAT DIVERSITY IN OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN PORTSMOUTH EXISTING LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAWS IS REALLY THE ISSUE AS ADVOCATES FOR AB TWO FIVE SEVEN SAY LET'S PLEASE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION BECAUSE NEITHER WAVE SECTOR COUNCIL OR GUIDING OF THE FRANCHISE MODEL WILL ADVANCE THESE IMPORTANT CAUSES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB TWO FIVE SEVEN THANK YOU AND. I AM WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THIS KILEY. ALL I SET ASIDE MY POLICY OBJECTIONS TO THE BILL IT. IT SEEMS DIFFICULT FOR THIS TO SURVIVE A COURT CHALLENGE BASED ON. SORT OF BEING A SURRENDER OF LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY SO- I MIGHT SUGGEST AND EVEN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- REYES IS SEEMS TO. REJECT THE RELEASE RAISES THAT CONCERN. AS I MIGHT SUGGEST YOU KNOW NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE AUTHORITY THAT. IS GRANTED TO THIS COUNCIL OR PROVIDING MORE STANDARDS IN THE LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE AUTHORITY. OR MAYBE PROVIDE SOME SAFEGUARDS FOR- INDIVIDUALS WHO FEEL LIKE- YOU KNOW THEY ARE TREATED UNFAIRLY BY THE COUNCIL- AS PERHAPS YOU KNOW GIVING IT A BETTER CHANCE. TO STAND UP TO A COURT CHALLENGE. THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY WITH INDUSTRIAL WAGE- COMMISSION. OF ESTABLISHING A SIMILAR TYPE OF BODY TO. INCREASE IMPACT WAGES IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND CHANGE- WAGES. THIS DOES EXPAND BEYOND THAT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT BUT IT DOES HAVE THE SAFEGUARDS THAT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT SO I THINK AS THE- AS ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. I DO BELIEVE THAT PROVIDES ENOUGH OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS- IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO PROVIDE FOR THIS WE WANT TO. YOU KNOW THIS IS A NEW- A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR SECTORIAL- VOICE OF SUPPORT HELP. PROCESS RIGHT EVERY TIME WE BRING. A BILL FORWARD IN THIS IN THIS- BODY WE HEAR YES BUT- THIS THIS MIGHT BE A PROBLEM OVER HERE BUT YOU'RE ALSO AFFECTING THESE BUSINESSES THAT YOU DIDN'T MEAN TO THIS WILL TAKE ABOUT ARGUMENT AWAY BECAUSE WE ARE SIMPLY. OFFERING A SPACE OF FAST FOOD RESTAURANTS RIGHT SO FAST FOOD AND FAST FOOD WORKERS AND SO I THINK WITH THE- THE APA AS WELL AS OUR HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA WITH AYE WC AYE I'M I'VE- I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- I UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON HOW. ON HOW THIS PLAYS OUT. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BECAUSE YOU MAY CLOSE. I YOU KNOW HOW. WE HAVE TO START SOMEWHERE IT IS NO IT WOULD BE THE FIRST OF ITS TYPE AND I WANT TO GIVE KUDOS TO THE FRANCHISEES WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION I AM NOT SUGGESTING IN ANY WAY THAT EVERY FRANCHISEE OR EVEN- EVERY BUSINESS MISTREATS ITS WORKERS OR DOESN'T DO THINGS WELL UNFORTUNATELY A VAST MAJORITY OF FAST FOOD WORKERS AT AGREE. THAT THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS ARE NOT AS DESCRIBED BY THE FRANCHISEES SO WHILE WE WOULD LOVE TO HOLD UP THOSE GOOD ACTORS- THAT WE HEARD TODAY WE MUST UNFORTUNATELY LEGISLATE ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT SUCH GOOD ACTORS IN EVEN IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FRANCHISEES WERE HEARING FROM THE BUSINESS OWNER NOT FROM THE WORKERS THIS IS ABOUT GIVING THE WORKERS A VOICE ON THE JOB AS WELL. THEY HAVE NEVER HAD THEIR INPUT TAKEN IN A WAY THAT FORMALIZED THAT'S CLEAR THAT PROVIDE STRUCTURE AND PROTECTION EMPOWERS THOSE VERY WORKERS WHO ARE AS WE HEARD FROM FROM THE WITNESS WORKERS WHO WHO SPENT DECADES IN THE INDUSTRY SO I THINK THE TIME HAS COME IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC IN A WAY THAT THAT REFOCUSES OUR ATTENTION ON THE INEQUITIES THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO IT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN THIS INDUSTRY I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I ABOUT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CHAO.

BILL MOVE ON AND MOVE FORWARD TO THE PREPARATION THERE ARE SPECIFIC. AMENDMENTS THAT ARE LISTED SHE'S TAKING THOSE AUTHORS AMENDMENT SHE WILL TAKE. THOSE AMENDMENTS. OKAY OKAY THANK YOU I WILL TAKE THOSE COOPER THOSE AMENDMENTS ON HER BEHALF. OVER RECENT DEBT DECADES IT'S BEEN CLEAR THAT THE UNIVERSITIES UNIVERSITIES NEED TO REEVALUATE THEIR APPROACH TO SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SHIFTED TRAUMA CENTERED POLICIES TO BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS WHEN THE MOST IMPORT POLICIES THAT MAKE SURVIVORS MORE LIKELY TO REPORT AND FOLLOW THROUGH WITH CHARGES IN THE PRESENCE OF TRAINED SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ON CAMPUS. HOWEVER ANY CAMPUS POLICIES IN THAT SPACE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE AND ARE OFTEN AT ODDS WITH THE SURVIVOR CENTERED RESPONSE THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS PROVIDE THIS MEANS THAT SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARE OFTEN FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN SUPPORTING THE NEEDS OF SURVIVORS AND COMPLYING WITH THE CAMPUS POLICIES THAT MAY NOT PRIORITIZE THOSE NEEDS EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE DOING WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF A SURVIVOR. A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR MEET FEAR LOSING THEIR EMPLOYMENT OR FACE DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST THE CAMPUS. WHEN SCHOOLS MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT HAMPER THE ABILITY OF SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR TO OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY THEY ENABLE A CAMPUS CLIMATE THAT CONDONES SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND SILENCES SURVIVORS. AB FOURTEEN SIXTY SEVEN WILL PROVIDE CLARITY TO SUCH A TO SITUATIONS BY ESTABLISHING THE SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE CAMPUS TITLE NINE OFFICE. WOULD ALSO ALLOW SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS TO MAINTAIN CONFIDENTIAL. CONFIDENTIALITY WITH SURVIVORS BY ENSURING THE CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS HAVE THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB WE WILL ENSURE THAT THEY WILL TURN. HAVE BETTER TOOLS TO SUPPORT STUDENT SURVIVORS- WE HAVE A- WE HAVE TESTIMONY ON THE LINE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

MANY DRIVERS WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE FILED REPORTS CORRECTLY HAD MADE HIGH EVEN TAKE THAT UNIVERSITIES JUSTIFICATION TO IGNORE THEIR STORY. A VICTIM ADVOCATE COULD HAVE CORRECTED THESE MISSTEPS OR BOARD THEM ALL TOGETHER BUT THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO HELP. INTENTIONALLY ROLLED AWAY FROM THE CONNECTICUT. THE VICTIM ADVOCATES IN MY THIRTY HAD SEVERE PROBLEMS WITH MENTAL HEALTH INCLUDING SUICIDALITY. NUMBER FORCED TO QUIT ENACTED SELF PRESERVATION OTHERS WERE PUSHED OUT WHEN THEY TRIED TO BEND THE RULES TO SUPPORT SURVIVORS AFFECTED LAKE. AS A RESULT THE VICTIM ADVOCACY OFFICE BECAME A REVOLVING DOOR OF STAFF WHO LEFT THEIR POSITIONS JUST THAT THEY GOT GOOD AT THEIR JOBS.
