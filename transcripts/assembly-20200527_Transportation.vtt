THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO

00:16:32.624 --> 00:16:33.726

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.968
HAS BEEN THAT WE CAN JUST HAVE

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:25.771

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:29.341

ALSO HAVING SOME IMPACTS THE

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:01.878
CERTAINLY A RIDERSHIP OF THOSE

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.413
WERE OPERATING. OF FOR US THE

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.614
BE IMPACTS A LITTLE BIT

00:53:04.681 --> 00:53:06.116
DIFFERENT- WE ARE GETTING SOME

00:53:06.182 --> 00:53:09.252
REQUESTS TO. SLOW DOWN A SOME

00:53:09.319 --> 00:53:11.187
OF OUR PROCESS IS TO ASSURE

THAT- PEOPLE CAN COMMENT FOR

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:15.058
EXAMPLE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:18.328

WE- UP OUT- A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:00.937
DIFFERENT STRATEGY THAT ALLOW

EXTENDED TO THOSE AREAS THIS IS

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:51.494
A PRUDENT APPROACH AND I

00:58:51.561 --> 00:58:53.429
BELIEVE IT'S ONE THAT WILL WORK

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.664
THAT'S HIS EXPECTATION FROST

00:58:54.731 --> 00:58:56.633

TRACK- QUESTION- A PARTICULAR

00:59:09.279 --> 00:59:11.214
IN THE COPA NINETEEN-

00:59:11.281 --> 00:59:14.017
ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S EXACTLY

00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:16.953
WHY WE WANNA- WE DO THINK WE

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:18.054
PLAYED OUT THE MOST PRUDENT

00:59:18.121 --> 00:59:19.822
APPROACH A GIVEN THE RESOURCES

00:59:19.889 --> 00:59:20.790
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.325
PROJECT FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.427
FORWARD ON THIS- WE THINK IT IS

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:27.597
IMPORT TO GET ALL OF THE-

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:28.865
HUNDRED NINETY MILE. SEGMENT

00:59:28.932 --> 00:59:30.867
DONE- WHICH IS A FEDERAL

00:59:30.934 --> 00:59:33.036
REQUIREMENT FOR US SO WE HAVE

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:34.003
TO CONTINUE THAT WORK

00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.939
COMPLETELY ENVIRONMENTAL WORK

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:37.740
GET THE BOOK AND A PROJECTS

00:59:37.807 --> 00:59:38.942
DONE BOTH IN LA IN NORTHERN

00:59:39.008 --> 00:59:42.178
CALIFORNIA- AND THEN THAT AGAIN

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.947
EXPAND TO A MORE OPERABLE

00:59:44.013 --> 00:59:47.016
SEGMENT FROM HUNDRED NINETY TO

00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:47.617
ONE SEVENTY ONE AGAIN AS THE

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:50.186
FIRST. BUILDING BLOCK- COMMENCE

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.454
TESTING OF TRAINS AND THEN

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:53.489
MOVING TO OPERATION SO WE THINK

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:54.824
THOSE ARE ALL THE IMPORTANT

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:57.093
THINGS TO DO IN AND ECONOMIC

00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.194
IMPACT IN THE EMPLOYMENT

00:59:58.261 --> 01:00:00.129
BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT- ARE

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:02.198
SUCH THAT- ESPECIALLY COMING

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:04.467
OUT OF A WHAT MIGHT BE OF LIKE

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:06.736
THE RECESSION THE KIDS- A VITAL

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:08.304
THAT WE HAVE THESE GUYS THE-

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.373
NAMIK GOVERNMENT OPPORTUNITY

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.409
THE- HAPPENING SO- SO I THINK

01:00:13.476 --> 01:00:14.811
THAT'S OF IMPORTANCE. IN TERMS

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.846
OF DOING THE PROJECT- WITHOUT-

01:00:16.913 --> 01:00:19.349
WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC MONEY- I

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.783
THINK UP THERE ARE SOME

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.151
CHALLENGES THERE THAT THAT ARE

01:00:22.218 --> 01:00:26.456
IMPORTANT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY-

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:28.725
I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO USE

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.526
PUBLIC MONEY AND WE ARE USING

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.395
PUBLIC MONEY OF FOR SOME OF THE

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.765
INITIAL THE CAPITAL WORKING TO

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:37.467
GET ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE TO

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:39.068
DO THINGS LIKE WEAR. A

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.703
PROCUREMENT I A USING THOSE

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.273
FUNDS TO. BETTER DEFINE THE

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:48.111
PROJECT TO THE RISK OF THE

01:00:48.177 --> 01:00:54.283
PROJECT THAT I THINK. THAT IN.

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.053
THE PRIVATE CAPITAL TO. EVEN

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:57.553
WHERE YOU HAVE A WHAT'S

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.856
CONSIDERED A PRIVATE ARE THE

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:00.456
WITH THE VIRGIN TRAINS AS IN

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:01.290
THIS OTHER CAL REGION I MEAN

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.892
REMEMBER THAT THERE IS THERE

01:01:02.959 --> 01:01:04.894
ARE PUBLIC ACTIONS NECESSARY TO

01:01:04.961 --> 01:01:06.729
MAKE THAT PROJECT OUT OF FOR

01:01:06.796 --> 01:01:08.064
EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING PUBLIC

01:01:08.131 --> 01:01:09.766
RIGHT OF WAY OR PROPOSING TO

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.134
USE A PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY THAT

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:14.037
MUST BE SEATED TO THEM BY THE-

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.139
STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE

01:01:16.205 --> 01:01:18.207
GETTING FINANCING HELP FROM THE

01:01:18.274 --> 01:01:19.075
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF THEY

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:21.911
ARE TAKING SO THE FIST OF THE

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.246
INVESTMENT RISK BUT WE ARE

01:01:23.312 --> 01:01:25.681
PROVIDING OTHER HELPFUL PARTS

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:27.583
TO THAT- TO THAT PROJECT AND

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.519
THEN LASTLY JUST AS THE BUDGET-

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:32.188
EXERCISE WE ARE ONLY SEEKING IN

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:32.989
THE BUDGET WHICH ALREADY

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:36.926
APPROPRIATED A TO THIS PROJECT

01:01:36.993 --> 01:01:41.497
THIS THROUGH A CAP TRADE

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.065
DETAINEES BRITISH AUCTIONS I

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:42.765
THINK IT'S A MAJOR ABOUT THE

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:46.035
POINTS. FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.904
THAT'S A OF TO THIS PROGRAM.

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.372

USE THE APPROPRIATE A FUNDS FOR

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:52.675
THIS PER AND SO WE ARE SEEKING

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:57.346
NOTHING. UP BEYOND THAT- AND-

01:01:57.413 --> 01:01:59.015

OF ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED

01:02:30.012 --> 01:02:31.447
PARCELS- TO COMPLETE THAT

01:02:31.514 --> 01:02:33.416
CONSTRUCTION WORK WE HAVE ABOUT

HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:43.793

THE DESIGN. OF THAT OF SEX SO

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.305
THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY A MAP. OF

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:59.075
THE RIGHT AWAY THAT WE NEED AT

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.776
ONE OF THE IMPORTANT LESSON

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:04.080
LEARNED. UP PROJECT- THAT I

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:05.248
WANNA CORPORATIONS I'VE BEEN

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:11.821
HERE IS- YOU KNOW BUT-

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:12.722
UNDERSTANDABLE REASON THEY GOT

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:14.290
IN BECAUSE- PRETTY EARLY. ON

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.791
THE EARLY PART OF THE PROJECT

01:03:15.858 --> 01:03:17.026
THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY WERE

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.094
UNDER A FEDERAL DEADLINE TO

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.929
SPEND FEDERAL MONEY. AND SO THE

01:03:19.996 --> 01:03:22.331
AUTHORITY I GOT A CONSTRUCTION

01:03:22.398 --> 01:03:23.032
BEFORE HAVING ALL THE RGHT

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:25.168
AWAY AND- WE DON'T INTEND TO

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:32.828
AREA AND LOS ANGELES. YES AND

01:05:32.895 --> 01:05:35.331
THEN HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:40.569
EXTEND TO THE BAY AREA. I THINK

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:42.071
THE INCREMENTAL COST TO GET TO

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:45.708
THE BAY AREA FROM- MERCED-

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.044
PURELY ON- HIGH SPEED RAIL

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.679
ASSETS THROUGH THE PROJECT GOES

01:05:49.745 --> 01:05:51.914
INTO SAN JOSE IN DECEMBER JUST

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.550
GOES ESTIMATED AROUND.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.118
SEVENTEEN OF BILLIONS OF

GET TO- TO THE BAY AREA AND HOW

01:06:03.526 --> 01:06:06.128
MUCH WOULD IT COST TO EXTEND A

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:09.231
TO LOS ANGELES. THAT'S THE

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.367
BAKERSFIELD THE PALM DALES

YOU KNOW WE USE RANGES BOTH OF

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:02.885
THESE STRETCHES YOUR

01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:03.753
IDENTIFYING ARE IN THE

01:07:03.819 --> 01:07:05.888
ENVIRONMENTAL SAYS. AS WE WORK

WE'RE UTILIZING THE AGES THAT

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:27.443
WAS PROVIDED- THAT THE CHAIR S.

01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:29.945
AS STATED. THIS PROJECT HAS

GROWN IN HOT SHRUNKEN SCOPE AND

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:34.250
IF I'M LOOKING CORRECTLY THE

01:07:34.316 --> 01:07:37.286
LOW RANGE OF THIS PROJECT IS

01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:38.554
SIXTY THREE BILLION. THE HIGH

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.723
RANGE OF THIS PROJECT IS A

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.224
NINETY EIGHT BILLION AND YOU

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.660
HAVE A BASE ESTIMATE OF EIGHTY

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:47.997
BILLION. CORRECT. YEAH THAT'S

01:07:48.063 --> 01:07:48.964
THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BUSINESS

01:07:49.031 --> 01:07:52.101
PLAN CORRECT SO WHAT IS THE SO

01:07:52.168 --> 01:07:53.536
THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO COME TO

01:07:53.602 --> 01:07:55.571
COMPLETE THE LA TO THE ENTIRE

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.306
LA TO SAN FRANCISCO SEGMENT. IS

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.408
YOU'RE ESTIMATING THE LOW RANGE

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.143
OF SIXTY THREE BILLION AND A

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:01.677
HIGH RANGE OF NINETY EIGHT

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.647
BILLION. CORRECT AND BUT IT

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:06.916
COULD GO HIGHER. WILL GO WELL

01:08:06.982 --> 01:08:09.418
IT I MEAN. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.021
WE DID IS. WE'VE UP YOU KNOW

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:13.789
INVESTMENT WHAT THE UNIT PRICES

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.357
ARE FOR THAT WORK TO GET THAT

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.692
WORK DONE IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.194
WE'RE STILL IN THE PROJECT

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.728
DEVELOPMENT PROCESS EARLY IN

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:22.031
THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAYS THOSE

01:08:22.097 --> 01:08:24.934
SEGMENTS ARE ABOUT 15% DESIGN-

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.669
NOW THERE'S A LOT. MORE TO DO

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.637
THERE YEAH WE'VE ESTIMATED

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:30.673
RANGES AT THE ENTIRETY OF PHASE

01:08:30.739 --> 01:08:32.308
ONE IS SIXTY THREE TO NINETY

01:08:32.374 --> 01:08:33.843
EIGHT WHAT WE DID IS WE USE

01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:35.845
THOSE MEASUREMENTS AND THEN WE

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:36.912
APPLIED THE BEST INDUSTRY

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.781
PRACTICES WITH THE I THINK I'M

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:40.816
GONNA HAVE A MEMBER HERE. BUT I

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.418
WANT TO SAY IT'S SORT OF A

01:08:42.485 --> 01:08:43.986
THIRTY GOING UP IN 20% TWIN

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:48.858
DOWN. FROM THOSE OF THOSE BUT

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:51.260
THOSE. RISE AND THAT. UP APPLY

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.496
RAIN AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

01:08:53.562 --> 01:08:55.798
WE GET WE'VE DONE ARTS SO THEN

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.832
WHAT WOULD BE ESTIMATED TIME

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:59.969
LINE BE TO COMPLETE I KNOW

01:09:00.035 --> 01:09:01.937
YOU'RE FOCUSED ON- PHASE ONE

01:09:02.004 --> 01:09:04.073
BUT FROM THE WHOLE MADE WHAT IS

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:06.275
ENVISIONED IN PROP ONE A WHAT

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:07.543
WOULD BE AND GET TO SEE A TIME

01:09:07.610 --> 01:09:09.245
BUT YEAH IT IT'S GOING TO BE

01:09:09.311 --> 01:09:12.815
ENTIRE TIED TO THE- FUND. AND

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.383
SO WHEN FOR TALK ABOUT THE- A

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.952
PROGRAM SCOPE SHRINKING- IN MY

01:09:17.019 --> 01:09:17.853
VIEW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.422
SPRING A SHRINKING BUT IT'S HOW

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:21.524
WE DO THE BUILDING BLOCK

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:24.226
APPROACH. AND THAT IS OF LIKE

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.128
IN ANY OTHER TRANSIT PROJECT.

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:27.530
THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:30.132
AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS- SO WHY

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:31.400
DO WE PICKED BAKERSFIELD TO

01:09:31.467 --> 01:09:33.269
PERCENT- WE PICK BAKERSFIELD

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:35.070
MERCED BECAUSE- THAT THAT'S AN

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:36.906
APPROPRIATE EXTENSION FROM

01:09:36.972 --> 01:09:38.541
HUNDRED NINETEEN. THAT WE THINK

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:39.675
WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH OUR

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.577
ESTIMATE AVAILABLE REVENUES.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:43.178
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY.

01:09:43.245 --> 01:09:45.581
IN SO AS MORE MONEY BECAME

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:47.182
AVAILABLE WITH MORE FEDERAL

PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING COSTS-

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:07.102
WE ESTIMATE A TWENTY THIRTY

01:10:07.169 --> 01:10:07.670
THREE A TIMELINE FOR ALL OF

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.539
PHASE ONE. I THINK A TWENTY

01:10:10.606 --> 01:10:11.974
THIRTY ONE TIMELINE FOR THE

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.208
VALUE BALLOT WHICH IS. SILICON

COST. OF FOR THE HUNDRED

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.002

COST OF THE OF THIS SEGMENT. I

01:12:47.062 --> 01:12:47.663
DON'T THINK THERE WASN'T A

01:12:47.730 --> 01:12:50.432
RESERVE ORIGINAL- SEGMENT FOR

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:52.835
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD- THE

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.269

CONSTRUCTION WAS OF THE HUNDRED

01:12:57.973 --> 01:12:58.474
NINETEEN I THINK ORIGINALLY

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:01.577
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A- WELL

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:04.646

OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK I

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:07.282
THINK THERE WAS A SIX BILLION

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.251
DOLLAR COST ESTIMATE ROUGHLY TO

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:11.754
GET THE ONE NINETEEN DONE THAT

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.355
THAT ESTIMATES NOW TWELVE POINT

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:15.390
FOUR. SO THEN I LOOK I GET THIS

01:13:15.457 --> 01:13:17.226
QUESTION ALL THE TIME FROM FROM

01:13:17.292 --> 01:13:18.393

THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:25.901
EVERY COST ESTIMATE HAS BEEN

01:13:25.968 --> 01:13:27.636
SEVERELY OFF TIME LINES HAVE

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.338
ALSO BEEN SEVERELY OFF. IN THE

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.406
PAST HAS SHOWN US. THAT THE

PLAN ANY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT

01:13:38.213 --> 01:13:39.648
WE SEE AN INCREASE YEARS

FROM MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD. IT

01:26:02.423 --> 01:26:04.259
DOES THAT INCLUDE CONNECTIVITY

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:05.960
POINTS FOR WHICH THE STATE HAS

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:07.896
ALREADY MADE MONEY AVAILABLE A

01:26:07.962 --> 01:26:09.931

SYSTEM. THE H. SYSTEM AND POP.

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:18.306
IN SORIDERSHIP ALONE ON THE

01:26:18.373 --> 01:26:20.141
MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:25.346
MILLION. BUT OF. THE RIGHT IN

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.714
THAT ENTIRE. CORRIDOR

01:26:26.781 --> 01:26:29.250
IMPROVEMENT GET UP TO A POINT A

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:31.152
WOULD YOU INCLUDED AT THE

01:26:31.219 --> 01:26:34.556
BENEFITS OF. OF THE CAPTIVITY

WITH ALL SO IT'S A- AND WHAT.

01:26:37.258 --> 01:26:42.263
AND THE. RIGHT NOW IT. IF WE DO

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:43.831
NOTHING WE DON'T INCLUDE THE

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.267
SPEED RAIL. THAT WRITER SHE- IS

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:48.236
ESTIMATED AT ABOUT THREE POINT

01:26:48.303 --> 01:26:48.870
NINE AND THEN WE WOULD LOOK TO

01:26:48.937 --> 01:26:50.905
BUMP THAT TO A POINT. RIGHT SO

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:52.607
AS I UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.642
TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.444
RAIL THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.546
BUILDING IN PHASE ONE. THAT'S

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:02.417
TWO MILLION WRITERS. SO AND THE

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.285
CONNECTIVITY POINTS ADD SIX

01:27:04.352 --> 01:27:05.787
POINT EIGHT MILLION SO AS I

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.956
HEAR THAT I WOULD THINK THAT

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.757
THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE THING

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:10.959
TO DO WOULD BE TO BUILD THE

01:27:11.025 --> 01:27:13.094
PORTIONS THAT HAVE HIGHER

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.829
RIDERSHIP WHICH ARE NOT THE

01:27:14.896 --> 01:27:16.264
TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR SEGMENT

01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:18.132
WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY BUT

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:20.501
THE CONNECTORS. OUT OF IT WHICH

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:22.737
I IMAGINE NOT BEING HIGH SPEED

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:23.304
RAIL WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:27:23.371 --> 01:27:25.540
LESS EXPENSIVE. WELL THERE'S A

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:26.608
THERE'S A FEW THINGS HERE IF

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:28.176
YOU WANT TO SEE IMPROVE

01:27:28.242 --> 01:27:31.579
RIDERSHIP ON. RAIL IN IN THIS

01:27:31.646 --> 01:27:33.081
AT THIS IN THAT. A CENTRAL

01:27:33.147 --> 01:27:36.951
VALLEY- THE ELEMENT OF BRINGING

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:37.952
IN HIGH SPEED RAIL- REDUCING

01:27:38.019 --> 01:27:41.055
THOSE TRAVEL TIMES BY. A NINETY

01:27:41.122 --> 01:27:43.658
MINUTES- IN THAT AREA- AND

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:45.293
HAVING THE SIMPLER CONNECTING

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:48.963
POINTS WITH ACE- AND THE- SAN

01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:50.565
JOAQUIN SERVICES WERE SET. IT

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:52.233
ALL WORKS TOGETHER TO IMPROVE

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.501
THE RIDERSHIP THROUGH THE

01:27:53.568 --> 01:27:55.403
ENTIRETY OF THAT CORRIDOR IT'S

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:56.904
NOT ONE THING BY ITSELF IT'S

01:27:56.971 --> 01:27:58.439
THE COMBINED WORK THE OTHER

01:27:58.506 --> 01:28:00.475
THING I WOULD JUST. NOTE IS

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:03.378
THAT YOU DON'T WE- WE HAVE TO

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.379
COMPLETE WORK ON OUR FEDERAL

01:28:04.445 --> 01:28:06.981
GRANT AGREEMENT NOW FOR THE

BETWEEN POPULAR ADD MADERA IN

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:12.153
SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO

01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:15.256
EXTEND- USE ABOUT FOUR POINT

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:17.058
EIGHT. BILLION MORE TO EXTEND

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.559
THE WORK. TO GET THE BILL IN

01:28:18.626 --> 01:28:21.763
THE SOUTH URBAN- AREA AND THE

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.498
DOWNTOWN MERCED IN THE NORTH

01:28:23.564 --> 01:28:26.167
AND SO INCOME AND- IS NOT. A

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:28.569
THE TWENTY POINT FOR ITS JUST A

01:28:28.636 --> 01:28:29.470
IS THE FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.673
DOLLARS. INCREASE THE OTHER

01:28:31.739 --> 01:28:32.774
THING I JUST THAT IS FOR THOSE

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:36.711
CONNECTION POINTS. IN MERCED

01:28:36.778 --> 01:28:38.413
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:43.751
THROUGH OTHER ADULT. THE YEAH

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:44.886
DISTRIBUTORS IN OTHER. IS

01:28:44.952 --> 01:28:45.787
ALREADY GIVE. ABOUT A BILL

01:28:45.853 --> 01:28:48.322
DOLLAR FOR X. OF THE- A SYSTEM

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.425
INTO A PERCENT. WHAT WE'RE

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:51.926
PROPOSING TO DO IS- HAVE THAT

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.162
MEET HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THEY

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:55.663
ARE WITH A- FOUR POINT EIGHT

01:28:55.730 --> 01:28:56.998
BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. SO

01:28:57.065 --> 01:28:58.399
QUESTION ABOUT THAT SO AS YOU

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.734
MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW I REPRESENT

01:28:59.801 --> 01:29:00.835
THE TRI VALLEY INCLUDING

01:29:00.902 --> 01:29:03.204
LIVERMORE RACE RUNS CURRENTLY.

01:29:03.271 --> 01:29:05.807
AN ACE RUNS FOUR TIMES IN THE

01:29:05.873 --> 01:29:06.808
MORNING AND FOUR TIMES THE

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:09.444
EVENING BECAUSE OF RIGHT AWAY

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:11.112
AS ON THE RAIL TRACK. I DON'T

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.480
ANTICIPATE THAT BEING ABLE TO

01:29:12.547 --> 01:29:14.215
SUPPORT THE INCREASED RIDERSHIP

01:29:14.282 --> 01:29:15.983
THAT YOU ARE ANTICIPATING HERE

01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:17.251
SO IS THERE WHAT KIND OF

01:29:17.318 --> 01:29:18.553
IMPROVEMENT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.855
THE A SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR THAT

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:21.422
INCREASED DEMAND THAT YOU'RE

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:25.793
PREDICTING. WELL THE FIRST IS.

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.729
THEY'RE GONNA EXTENDED PERCENT-

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.398
WHICH THEY THEY DON'T TODAY-

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.934
THERE ARE- DETERMINATION POINT

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.802
ON THE EAST IS IN THE STOCKTON-

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.038
THE AREA SO THE FIRST EXTENSION

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:38.706
IS DOWN TO SERIES AND THEN A

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:42.310
FURTHER DOWN INTO- MERCED- AND

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:45.680
THEN- BETWEEN THAT AND- UP BUS

01:29:45.747 --> 01:29:48.349
SERVICES- ACES PROPOSING

FROM US- IS ALSO PROPOSING TO-

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:55.857

SERVICE THE NORTH TO. A

01:29:58.025 --> 01:30:01.362
SACRAMENTO- BY THE END OF THE

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:03.131
TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY'VE GOT A

01:30:03.197 --> 01:30:04.565
BROADER WHAT THEY CALL I THINK

01:30:04.632 --> 01:30:06.434
IT'S CALLED THE VISION VALLEY

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:08.503
VISION PLAN ABOUT LIKE FORWARD-

01:30:08.569 --> 01:30:10.705
PLAN WHICH IS- IN INVESTMENT IN

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:12.907
BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN'S- AND THE

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:16.944
AGE SERVICES TO EXPAND- WRITER-

01:30:17.011 --> 01:30:19.247
EXPAND SERVICES A GOING NORTH

01:30:19.313 --> 01:30:21.549
INTO SACRAMENTO AND WEST INTO

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:22.884
THE OPEN OF COURSE THE BIG

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:24.952
RACES THE EXTENSION ALL THE WAY

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:28.022
DOWN 2% BUT EXPAND. IS SORRY

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:30.458
GOING DIRECTLY STATE OF THE

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.593
OTHER THING IS THE- THERE IS

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:35.263
WORK- GOING ON TO HAVE THE A

01:30:35.329 --> 01:30:39.967
SYSTEM OF ALSO- EXTEND ITS-

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:41.969
IT'S- STATION LOCATION AND WERE

01:30:42.036 --> 01:30:44.872
SAID TO ME THE SAN JOAQUIN IN

01:30:44.939 --> 01:30:45.673
THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AND

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.475
A SINGLE A SINGLE STATION SO

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:48.943
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:51.612
THAT- ARE PART OF A THE

01:30:51.679 --> 01:30:54.482
PROGRAM. SO AS THOSE OF US THAT

01:30:54.549 --> 01:30:55.783
LIVE AS A FORMER BURKE COMMUTER

01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.451
AND SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.987
MUCH OF THE PART AND COMMUNITY

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.756
EXTENDING BART OUT HAS BEEN A

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:02.857
POSITIVE THING SESSION

01:31:02.924 --> 01:31:04.091
COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT BUT IT

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.426
SURELY DOES NOT INCREASE

01:31:05.493 --> 01:31:07.028
CAPACITY IN FACT IT DOES JUST

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:09.096
THE OPPOSITE SO WHAT I'M ASKING

01:31:09.163 --> 01:31:10.364
IS THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY IN

01:31:10.431 --> 01:31:12.166
SUFFICIENT PASS YUNIS AROUND

01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:12.900
FOUR TIMES THE MORNING FOUR

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.569
TIMES THE EVENING MAKING GO

01:31:14.635 --> 01:31:15.469
FURTHER DOESN'T INCREASE THE

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.572
AMOUNT OF WRITER THE ABILITY OF

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:18.372
A WRITER'S ON THAT TRAIN IN

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:19.440
FACT IT JUST MAKES IT MORE

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:21.142
IMPACTED. SO MY QUESTION IS HOW

01:31:21.209 --> 01:31:22.677
YOU CAN IMPROVE BASE TO MEET

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.312
THE DEMAND THAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:31:24.378 --> 01:31:29.283
IT CAN. HOLD WANTED TO SEND IT

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:31.586
OUT I BELIEVE THEIR INTENTION

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.221
IS TO EXTEND THEIR FOR YOU. AS

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:34.655
ALTHOUGH. I DON'T HAVE BEEN FOR

01:31:34.722 --> 01:31:36.257
OF ME X. OF WHAT THAT IS IT IS

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:37.425
YOUR RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THE-

01:31:37.491 --> 01:31:38.626
PHYSICAL EXTENSION BUT IT'S

01:31:38.693 --> 01:31:40.661
ALSO THE- FREQUENCY EXTENSION

01:31:40.728 --> 01:31:43.164
OF THOSE- THOSE SERVICES. AND

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:44.966
THAT'S PART OF AN EFFORT THAT

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:48.870
THEY ARE WORKING- BUT THE- THE

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:51.739
CAL STATE SO LEAD ON. A RAIL

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:53.441
CHAD EDISON IS OF THE AUTHOR OF

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:56.110
THE STATE RAIL PLAN- A AND-

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.412
AGAIN WITH THE DOLLARS THAT

01:31:58.479 --> 01:31:59.547
THEY'VE BEEN. I GIVEN SO

01:31:59.614 --> 01:32:00.882
THERE'S BOTH A FREAK FREQUENCY

01:32:00.948 --> 01:32:04.318
EXPANSION. OF A AND A AND AS I

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:06.020
SAID THERE. PROGRAM IS TO GO

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:08.856
NOT JUST TO. NOT JUST BACK TO

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:12.260
THE BAY AREA BUT THEY ALSO. THE

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:15.730
LINE EXACTLY. SO THAT WE DO TO

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:18.399
DESTINY POINTS NORTH SAID WORSE

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.268
TODAY ACES JUST OFFER A SERVICE

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:23.170
TO WHAT. SO I MEAN I THINK BACK

01:32:23.237 --> 01:32:24.272
TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT

01:32:24.338 --> 01:32:26.040
EARLIER WE NEED ANSWERS RIGHT

01:32:26.107 --> 01:32:27.775
FOR BUILDING TRAIN ASSUMING WE

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.176
CAN CONNECT INTO THE VERY USING

01:32:29.243 --> 01:32:31.078
A CITIES CURRENTLY RUNS AT SUCH

01:32:31.145 --> 01:32:32.280
LIMITED CAPACITY. WE CAN'T

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:33.915
ASSUME ANSWERS WE NEED TO HAVE

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:35.650
A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:36.984
CONNECTIVE ITTY AND I WANT TO

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:38.619
ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:40.688
IN THAT I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.056
BRAILLE PROJECTS AND CLEAN RAIL

01:32:42.123 --> 01:32:46.127
PROJECTS- I AM A HUGE ADVOCATE

01:32:46.193 --> 01:32:47.795
FOR VALUING WHICH I THINK IS A

01:32:47.862 --> 01:32:48.863
WONDERFUL CLEAN REAL PROJECT.

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:51.532
AND TO THAT POINT I THINK USE

01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:52.733
THE SECRETARY SPOKE ELOQUENTLY

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.635
ABOUT. NOT WANTING THOSE IN THE

01:32:54.702 --> 01:32:55.403
CENTRAL VALLEY TO BE

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:56.971
GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED AND

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:58.306
WANTING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS

01:32:58.372 --> 01:33:00.341
THAT COME WITH. EXPANDING

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.275
TRANSPORTATION TO COME TO THE

01:33:01.342 --> 01:33:02.643
CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT I THINK

01:33:02.710 --> 01:33:04.178
MANY OF US IN THIS BODY

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:05.579
UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THAT

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:06.948
GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION MEANS

01:33:07.014 --> 01:33:08.649
CONNECTING THEM IN. THE LARGER

01:33:08.716 --> 01:33:09.817
URBAN CENTERS WHERE THERE ARE

01:33:09.884 --> 01:33:11.953
SO MANY JOBS. AND THIS CURRENT

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:13.220
PHASE DOESN'T DO THAT IN

01:33:13.287 --> 01:33:14.689
ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL COME

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:15.790
UP WITH A PLAN FOR A IS TO BE

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:16.857
ABLE TO HANDLE THAT IS

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:17.959
INSUFFICIENT I THINK WE NEED TO

01:33:18.025 --> 01:33:19.493
HAVE A PLAN. AND ONE THAT IS

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.895
MEANINGFUL AND THAT MEANS THAT

01:33:20.962 --> 01:33:23.597
THESE BOOKENDS. THAT ACTUALLY

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:26.701
MEANINGFULLY CONNECTS. TO THE-

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:28.002
URBAN CENTERS WHERE THE JOBS

01:33:28.069 --> 01:33:29.537
ARE THE WILL BRING ECONOMIC

01:33:29.603 --> 01:33:31.639
DEVELOPMENT TO PLACES LIKE

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:32.873
STOCKTON AND THIS IN NORTHERN

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.645
TO BE A PRIORITY AND NOT THE

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:39.046
WELL WE'LL DO THIS IF WE GET

01:33:39.113 --> 01:33:40.414
THE MONEY DOWN THE LINE.

01:33:40.481 --> 01:33:42.016
BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.117

01:33:47.922 --> 01:33:49.357
AREA I THINK GIVEN THE CURRENT

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:50.825
ECONOMIC TIMES IN THE FORECAST

01:39:57.257 --> 01:39:59.326
PENALTIES IN PARTICULAR. AS I

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:00.361
UNDERSTAND IT THE PROPOSED

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:01.795
INCREMENTAL ROLL OUT OF THE

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:02.696
HIGH SPEED RAIL PLAN WILL

01:40:02.763 --> 01:40:04.098
NECESSARILY ENTAIL MORE

01:40:04.164 --> 01:40:06.633
TRANSFERS THAN WOULD OTHERWISE

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:08.102
BE THE CASE OF A BILL THAT MY

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:09.269
RESEARCH IN THIS AREA FOCUSED

01:40:09.336 --> 01:40:10.437
MERRILY ON ENTRAPMENT

01:40:10.504 --> 01:40:11.839
TRIPOLITAN TRAVELING NOT

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:13.874
INTERMINABLE AND TRAVELS. TO

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:14.775
THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIOR OUT

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.744
THERE IS THE SAME. I SHOULD

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.078
NOTE THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE

01:40:18.145 --> 01:40:19.913
NOT SPECIFIC TO PLANS FOR HIGH

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.415
SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. SO I

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.983
DO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:24.451
FINDS THE MUSEUM THE

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:25.986
DELIBERATION. FIRST SOME

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:27.821
BACKGROUND A TRAVEL BEHAVIOR.

01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:29.189
THE INDIVIDUAL DEMAND FOR

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:31.291
TRAVEL IS MOSTLY DERIVED FROM

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:33.060
THE NEED OR DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:34.928
ACTIVITIES LIKE WORKER

01:40:34.995 --> 01:40:37.131
SOCIALIZING. TO PAIN GOODS LIKE

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:40.033
GROCERS ARE CLOSER- SERVICES

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.702
LIKE MEDICAL CARE AMERICA. WELL

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:42.903
THE EXPERIENCE IN RECENT WEEKS

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:44.204
WHAT IT MEANS TO NOT BE ABLE TO

01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:45.672
SATISFY THE DEMAND IN THE HIGH

01:40:45.739 --> 01:40:47.408
SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS THEY

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:49.710
CAN ENTAIL. SECOND WHEN PEOPLE

01:40:49.777 --> 01:40:51.345
TRAVEL THEY ENCOURAGE THREE

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:54.581
SORTS OF COST. MONETARY COST.

01:40:54.648 --> 01:40:56.283
HI I'M COST AND RISK AND

01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:57.951
UNCERTAINTY COST. SEVEN

01:40:58.018 --> 01:41:00.087
DECIDING WHETHER TO GO OUT TO

01:41:00.154 --> 01:41:00.854
DINNER WE TRAVEL TO ANOTHER

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.623
CITY. PEOPLE BALLOTS THE THREE

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:03.757
KINDS OF COSTS TO GET THE

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:06.593
BENEFITS OF THAT ACTIVITY GOOD

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.228
OR SERVICE AT THE DESTINATION.

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:10.397
AND THIRD ONCE ONE HAS DECIDED

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:12.666
TO TRAVEL TO SAY A PHARMACY AN

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:13.967
IMPORTANT STEP IN THE DECISION

01:41:14.034 --> 01:41:15.636
MAKING PROCESS CONCERNS MODE

01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:17.438

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.473
PHARMACY RIDE A BIKE OR SCOOTER

01:41:19.540 --> 01:41:21.375
TAKE A BUS OR STREETCAR LIFTER

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:22.976
UBER. GET A RIDE FOR A FRIEND

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:24.545
OR IF I HAVE A CAR SHOULD I

01:41:24.611 --> 01:41:26.346
DRIVE. DOWN BUT TRAVELERS

01:41:26.413 --> 01:41:27.881
TYPICALLY DO NOT GET A PENCIL

01:41:27.948 --> 01:41:29.049
AND PAPER AND WEIGH THE COSTS

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.818
AND BENEFITS OF THE TRAVEL MODE

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:32.319
EACH TIME THEY TRAVEL. THEY DO

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.854
MAKE THESE CALCULATIONS IN SOME

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:36.023
MANNER. THE ONES TRAVEL CHOICES

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:38.091
ARE MADE IN HABITS FORM. SUCH

01:41:38.158 --> 01:41:39.560
AS WHEN MOST PEOPLE DRIVE TO

01:41:39.626 --> 01:41:41.328
MOST DESTINATIONS. ARE MOSTLY

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:43.831
BLIGHTED CITIES. THEY TEND NOT

01:41:43.897 --> 01:41:45.065
TO REVISIT THESE OPTIONS UNLESS

01:41:45.132 --> 01:41:47.835
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO MAKE THEM

01:41:47.901 --> 01:41:48.836
RETHINK THEIR CHOICES. THE SAME

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.404
DECISION CREDIT- PROSTITUTES

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:52.139
APPLY TO INNER CITY TRAVEL AND

01:41:52.206 --> 01:41:54.341
MODE CHOICE. SHOULD I DRIVE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:56.109
ALONE DRIVE WITH OTHERS TAKE A

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:59.179
BUS TO TRAIN OR AIRPLANE. RIGHT

01:41:59.246 --> 01:42:00.581
THE TIME IN THE RICH CONCERT

01:42:00.647 --> 01:42:02.349
BECAUSE OF THESE VARIOUS

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:03.717
OPTIONS ALL WEIGHED AGAINST ONE

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.285
ANOTHER AS WELL AS FOR GOING

01:42:05.352 --> 01:42:07.120
THE TRIP OF THE COST YOUR

01:42:07.187 --> 01:42:08.956
DEEMED TOO HIGH. SO WHERE DID

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:09.523
TRANSFERS COME INTO A LITTLE

01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:11.658
BIT. EXCEPT FOR TRAVELING

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:14.194
SOMEWHERE BY FOOT VIRTUALLY ALL

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:14.795
TRIPS ENTAILED SOME KINDS OF

01:42:14.862 --> 01:42:16.897
TRANSPORT. I MIGHT WALK TO MY

01:42:16.964 --> 01:42:18.832
CAR IN MY DRIVEWAY DRIVE TO THE

01:42:18.899 --> 01:42:20.033
PHARMACY AND WALKED TO THE

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.935
PARKING AT THE STORE AND THAT

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:24.171
ENTAIL TRANSFERS. I'M I WALK TO

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:25.706
MY HOUSE TO RIDE YOU TAKE IT TO

01:42:25.772 --> 01:42:26.807
AN AIRPORT WALK THROUGH

01:42:26.874 --> 01:42:28.342
SECURITY TO THE GATE ONTO AN

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:30.511
AIRPLANE. AND FLY TO CHICAGO

01:42:30.577 --> 01:42:32.246
CHANGED PLANES IN CHICAGO AND

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:34.314
THEN FLY TO WASHINGTON DC. IN

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:36.250
DC I WALK FROM THE PLANE TO DC

01:42:36.316 --> 01:42:39.219
METRO CHANGE TRAINS AND WALKED

01:42:39.286 --> 01:42:40.187
MY FINAL DESTINATION. AT THE

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:43.891
LEAST EIGHT TRANSFERS WERE A

01:42:43.957 --> 01:42:44.424
LONG CROSS COUNTRY TRIP.

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:45.792
RICHARD SHOWS THAT ADDITIONAL

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:47.094
TRANSFERRED INCREASE THE

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.096
OVERALL TRANSFER PENALTY MORE

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:50.898
THAN PROPORTIONALLY. WHICH

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:53.233
EXPLAINS WHY AIR TRAVELERS WILL

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.067
PAY A PREMIUM FOR NONSTOP

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:56.336
FLIGHTS. AND WHY SO FEW TRANSIT

01:42:56.403 --> 01:42:57.437
PASSENGERS WILL MAKE TWO OR

01:42:57.504 --> 01:43:00.374
MORE TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSES OR

01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:00.941
TRAINS ON THE GIVEN TRANSIT

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:03.243
TRIP. FURTHER NEED COURSE

01:43:03.310 --> 01:43:04.678
TRANSFERS SUCH AS CHANGING

01:43:04.745 --> 01:43:06.380
PLANES ARE MOVING FROM ONE BUS

01:43:06.446 --> 01:43:08.181
TO ANOTHER TYPICALLY ENTAIL

01:43:08.248 --> 01:43:11.385
HIGHER TRANSFER PENALTIES OF

01:43:11.451 --> 01:43:12.519
THOSE MADE AT THE TRIP IN. THAT

01:43:12.586 --> 01:43:14.321
IS SUCH TRANSFERRED BEADED BY

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:15.722
TRAVELER MORE HEAVILY THAN

01:43:15.789 --> 01:43:17.491
OTHER PARTS OF THE JOURNEY.

01:43:17.558 --> 01:43:18.592
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY RAISE A

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:20.360
LOT OF QUESTIONS WHERE WILL I

01:43:20.427 --> 01:43:22.095
GET OFF THAT PLANE IN CHICAGO

01:43:22.162 --> 01:43:23.664
IS THE GATE FOR MY CONNECTING

01:43:23.730 --> 01:43:25.499
FLIGHT NEAR OR FAR STILL HAVE

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:26.934
TIME TO MAKE THE SWITCH WHICH

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.468
WAY DO I GO. WOULD HAVE MY

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:29.570
FLIGHT IS DELAYED THE MY NECK

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:31.405
AND CONNECTING FLIGHT IS NOT.

01:43:31.471 --> 01:43:34.441
THE MORE HALF TO UNCERTAINTY

01:43:34.508 --> 01:43:35.709
THE HIGHER THE TRANSFER PENALTY.

01:43:35.776 --> 01:43:37.210
THE RESURGENT PUBLIC TRANSIT

01:43:37.277 --> 01:43:38.412
WHICH I KNOW BEST SHOWS THE

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:40.414
PASSENGERS. WEIGHT TRANSFER

01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.849
TIME AT ABOUT ONE AND A HALF.

01:43:42.916 --> 01:43:43.750
TO FOUR AND A HALF TIMES THE

01:43:43.817 --> 01:43:45.786
VEHICLE TIME. FOR ABOUT THREE

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:47.554
TIMES GREATER ON AVERAGE. THAT

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:49.423
IS TO AN AVERAGE TRAVELER WHO

01:43:49.489 --> 01:43:50.424
RIDE THE SUBWAY FOR TEN

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.626
MINUTES. TRANSFERRED TO. WAIT

01:43:52.693 --> 01:43:53.727
TEN MINUTES FOR DIFFERENT TRAIN

01:43:53.794 --> 01:43:55.128
AND THEN RISE TWENTY MINUTES TO

01:43:55.195 --> 01:43:56.930
A DESTINATION. THAT TEN MINUTE

01:43:56.997 --> 01:43:58.765
TRANSFER IS CONSIDERED A BALLOT

01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:00.534
IS BURDENSOME IS THE ENTIRE

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.235
THIRTY MINUTE SPENT RIDING THE

01:44:02.302 --> 01:44:04.438
TRAIN. THIS IN A NUTSHELL IS

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.974
THE TRANSCRIPT AND- NINE

01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:07.608
MENTIONED IN THAT TRAIN PENALTY

01:44:07.674 --> 01:44:09.810
IS A- TO ABOUT ONE AND A HALF

01:44:09.876 --> 01:44:10.677
TO FOUR AND A HALF TIMES THE

01:44:10.744 --> 01:44:12.679
VEHICLE. BUT THE DIFFERENCE

01:44:12.746 --> 01:44:14.047
BETWEEN A TEN MINUTE WAIT

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.415
FEELING LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:17.017
GREAT TEN MINUTE WAIT FEELING

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:19.186
BY FORTY FIVE MINUTES A LOT. SO

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:20.988
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE

01:44:21.054 --> 01:44:22.556
DONE TO REDUCE TRANSFER THEM TO.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:23.790

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.399
BASED BOTH ON OUR OWN RESEARCH

01:44:32.466 --> 01:44:33.800
AND ON FINDING THE BEST IN THE

01:44:43.977 --> 01:44:46.113
BECOME MEANINGFUL. FOR EXAMPLE

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:48.148
IF CONNECTING ON A COMMUTER

01:44:48.215 --> 01:44:49.483

YOU'RE TRYING. WHETHER YOU'RE

TO THE SUBWAY. THE FIRST AND

01:45:08.068 --> 01:45:09.903
MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SAFETY

01:45:09.970 --> 01:45:11.938
AND SECURITY. THE QUICKEST WAY

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:13.573
TO DRIVE AWAY PASSENGERS WOULD

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:15.409
MAKE THEM FEEL UNSAFE. FOR ITS

RISKY WHILE THEY'RE WAITING OR

TRANSFERRING. THE SECOND MOST

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:20.414
IMPORTANT THING IS CONNECTIONS

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:23.784

DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE MISSED THAT

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:29.589
OTHER FLIGHT TO THAT BACK TO

THE LEFT JUST BEFORE WE WERE TO

01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:32.759
CATCH IT. IS EXTREMELY

01:45:32.826 --> 01:45:34.261
FRUSTRATING IN AND AGGRAVATE

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.896
PASSENGERS IMMENSELY. THOSE

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:39.266
FAMOUS. TIME TRANSFER YOUR

ALL CONNECTIONS AFTER THE

CONNECTIONS ARE KEY TO MAKE

01:45:49.009 --> 01:45:51.011
THAT BETTER. AND THEN FINALLY

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:52.913

BUT ONLY IF THOSE FIRST THREE

01:46:00.087 --> 01:46:01.822
PACKAGES SATISFIED. SO TRANSFER

IS I THINK IMPROVED. FROM PAST

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:10.709
PRACTICE. WITH HER TO THE UP

02:04:10.776 --> 02:04:13.712
THE RISKS OF CLAWBACK HOW YOU

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.684
CONTINGENCY PLANS IF THE CALLED

IF THE CLAW BACKS COME BACK AND

02:04:20.152 --> 02:04:21.921
I WOULD POINT THIS OUT IT WAS A

02:04:21.987 --> 02:04:24.023
CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WHO

02:04:24.089 --> 02:04:25.624
RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A VERY

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:27.660
RECKLESS DECISION. TO PUT A

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:29.528
BUNCH OF MONEY FEDERAL MONEY

02:04:29.595 --> 02:04:32.364
OUT. BEFORE YOU HAD RIGHTS OF

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:32.932
WAY HAD ANY. PROPERTY UPON

02:04:32.998 --> 02:04:36.502
WHICH- TO BUILD AND IT WAS. THE

02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:39.638
AUDITOR'S CONCLUSION. THAT

02:04:39.705 --> 02:04:42.741
OTHER THAT THAT DECISION OPENS

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:45.711
SERIOUS RISK. OF PENALTIES FROM

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:48.113
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:50.249
THEIR CONTINGENCY PLANS IF YOU

02:04:50.316 --> 02:04:51.984
HAVE TO CALL BACK IN THE STATE

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.686
OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO GIVE BACK

02:04:53.752 --> 02:04:56.589
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WELL UP

02:04:56.655 --> 02:04:59.491
FIRST- I DO NOT SEE ANY BASIS

02:04:59.558 --> 02:05:03.395
FOR- CLAWBACK OF THE TWO POINT

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:04.163
FOUR TWO POINT FIVE BILLION

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:05.464
DOLLAR ARE OF FUNDS THOSE

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:07.466
DOLLARS ARE SPENT. AND WE HAVE

02:05:07.533 --> 02:05:10.169
MATCHED- ROUGHLY 56% OF THOSE

02:05:10.236 --> 02:05:13.472
FUNDS NOW- AND- BY THE YEAR'S

02:05:13.539 --> 02:05:15.407
END THEY'LL BE FULLY MATCH THAN

02:05:15.474 --> 02:05:17.810
SO I SEE A NO BASIS FOR THOSE

02:05:17.877 --> 02:05:19.845
DOLLARS BECAUSE BACK AT ALL BUT

02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:21.580
SECONDLY WE ARE CHALLENGING

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:23.782
VIGOROUSLY IN LITIGATION. THE

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.484
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION

02:05:25.551 --> 02:05:27.620
TO TRY TO CALL BACK THE NINE

02:05:27.686 --> 02:05:28.687
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION

THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN ACCESS

02:05:29.822 --> 02:05:32.191
YEAH- I THINK ULTIMATELY THE

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:33.459
DECISION IS GOING TO BE MADE ON

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:35.427
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE DOLLARS

02:05:35.494 --> 02:05:37.162
ARE. FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM

02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:39.164
CLAWBACK COUPLE- IS GOING TO BE

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:40.566
DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT WE

02:05:40.633 --> 02:05:42.201
ARE GOING TO BE. DETERMINED ON

02:05:42.268 --> 02:05:43.469
THE BASIS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:45.504
MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON

02:05:45.571 --> 02:05:48.340
THIS PROJECT. AND MY NUMBER ONE

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:51.143
PRIORITY IS TO DO THAT. IS TO-

02:05:51.210 --> 02:05:52.544
MAKE PROGRESS TO SHOW THAT WE

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.813
ARE- HEADING TOWARD MEETING OUR

FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS IN TERMS OF

02:05:56.849 --> 02:05:58.817
THE TIMELINE- AND THAT WE ARE

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:00.552
MOVING FORWARD. AN ADVANCING

02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:01.787
THIS PROJECT CONSISTENT WITH

02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:03.789
THE SPIRIT OF OUR FEDERAL MONEY

02:06:03.856 --> 02:06:06.525
GRANT AGREEMENT. AND THAT'S

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:08.961
THAT'S MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. OF

02:06:09.028 --> 02:06:11.730
ANY TERMS OF CONTINGENCY PLANS-

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:12.898
YOU KNOW IF THE CAP AND TRADE

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:13.999
FUNDS RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE COME

02:06:14.066 --> 02:06:16.135
IN AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

02:06:16.201 --> 02:06:17.436
THIRTY TWO MILLION. DOLLARS A

02:06:17.503 --> 02:06:20.139
YEAR OF FOR THIS PROJECT SINCE

02:06:20.205 --> 02:06:22.541
CAP AND TRADE BEEN EXTENDED- IF

02:06:22.608 --> 02:06:26.478
THAT CONTINUES WE WILL BE ABLE

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:27.880
TO FOR THE LOSS OF THE NOT

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:28.480
TWENTY NINE. I THINK OKAY AND

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:32.251
TRADE TO HIS TICKET FIVE EIGHTY

02:06:32.318 --> 02:06:33.585
EVERY YEAR FOR THAT TO HAVE.

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:35.821
BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR

02:06:35.888 --> 02:06:36.355
WITH THE- CAP AND TRADE IS

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:42.561
PRESS. YEAH REVENUES ARE VOTER.

02:06:42.628 --> 02:06:45.164
IN THEM AND IN SO THOSE ARE

02:06:45.230 --> 02:06:46.932
THINGS WE WHILE. A VERY CLOSE

02:06:46.999 --> 02:06:47.633
IN TERMS OF A CONTINGENCY

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.468
THERE'S OF TWO WE WOULD WE

02:06:49.535 --> 02:06:51.403
WOULD. OF YOU KNOW SO MORE FOR

02:06:51.470 --> 02:06:53.772
FROM SO ELSE OR PROBABLY MORE

02:06:53.839 --> 02:06:56.075
LIKELY WE WOULD REDUCE GO. OF

02:06:56.141 --> 02:06:58.177
THIS PROJECT IN EXACTLY HOW

02:06:58.243 --> 02:06:59.144
THEY WOULD DO THAT HOW WE WOULD

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:01.613
DO THAT- YOU KNOW I'M NOT. A

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.615
PUTTING OUT YET- TODAY BECAUSE

02:07:03.682 --> 02:07:04.850
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO

02:07:04.917 --> 02:07:06.919
COME TO THAT- BUT THOSE ARE THE

02:07:06.986 --> 02:07:08.187
OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE BEFORE.

02:07:08.253 --> 02:07:09.822
REDUCE THE SCOPE TAKE ON A

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:11.790
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT APPROACH.

02:07:11.857 --> 02:07:14.927
TO HOW WE MOVED MOVE THIS FALL.

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.829
AND SO. THOSE ARE THE TWO ARE

02:07:16.895 --> 02:07:19.098
ARE PRIMARILY PRIMARILY. THE

02:07:19.164 --> 02:07:22.434
OPTIONS BEFORE. I START I'M

02:07:22.501 --> 02:07:23.969
HEARING. TIME WILL TELL AS-

02:07:24.036 --> 02:07:26.071

WITH A- TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE

02:07:28.540 --> 02:07:29.975
SO YOU'RE GOING TO. FULL TIME

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:33.412

WE'RE GONNA PREVAIL LITIGATION

02:07:35.381 --> 02:07:36.915
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:38.384
THAT WE DO DEEP THE ROLE RISK

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:40.285
ANALYSIS ON ALL ELEMENTS OF

02:07:40.352 --> 02:07:42.554

CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS COME IN I

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:45.557
THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY

02:07:45.624 --> 02:07:46.892
IMPORTANT- IN LIGHT OF THE

AND SO WE'RE GONNA WATCH VERY

02:07:53.899 --> 02:07:55.567
CAREFULLY WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE

02:07:55.634 --> 02:07:57.636
NEXT COUPLE OF OCTAVES. AND

02:16:59.578 --> 02:17:01.780
AND I WOULD- ALSO ASSOCIATE MY

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:03.381
COMMENTS WITHOUT MANY OF THE

02:17:03.448 --> 02:17:04.883
QUESTIONS THAT THE ANALYSIS

02:17:04.950 --> 02:17:07.352
RAISES- AND THERE ARE MANY AND

02:17:07.419 --> 02:17:08.486
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE

02:17:08.553 --> 02:17:09.588
MALL. BUT I THINK THAT THERE

02:17:09.654 --> 02:17:11.756
ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT ARE

02:17:11.823 --> 02:17:13.425
RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT DO

02:17:13.491 --> 02:17:16.294
NEED TO BE- REALLY ADDRESSED-

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:17.495
YOU KNOW A FEW THINGS THAT I

02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.797
HEARD TODAY I. KIND OF STRUCK

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:24.369
ME- ONE WAS- FROM- SECRETARY

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:26.571
KIM WHO. MENTIONED I THINK AT

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:27.772
LEAST ONCE MAYBE MORE THAN ONCE

02:17:27.839 --> 02:17:29.040
THAT WE WERE ABANDONING

02:17:29.107 --> 02:17:30.842
ELECTRIFICATION AND OR THAT

02:17:30.909 --> 02:17:32.210
THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO ABANDON

02:17:32.277 --> 02:17:34.779
ELECTRIFICATION. AS FAR AS I

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:35.380
UNDERSTAND IT IS SOMEONE WHO'S

02:17:35.447 --> 02:17:37.282
READ THOSE WITH THOSE IDEAS AS

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:39.818
OPTIONS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:41.086
HAS TALKED ABOUT ABANDONING

02:17:41.152 --> 02:17:44.089
ELECTRIFICATION THERE HAS BEEN

02:17:44.155 --> 02:17:46.491
TALK ABOUT. HOW WHAT ON WHAT

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:48.627
SCHEDULE THE PROJECT WILL BE

02:17:48.693 --> 02:17:50.362
COMPLETED AND I THINK THERE'S A

02:17:50.428 --> 02:17:51.062
VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:17:51.129 --> 02:17:52.931
SAYING THAT. SOMEHOW WE WOULD

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:54.966
DO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE END

02:17:55.033 --> 02:17:55.567
GOAL WILL BE TO NOT ELECTRIFY

02:17:55.634 --> 02:17:59.938
IT. AS OPPOSED TO. A CONCEPT OF

02:18:00.005 --> 02:18:01.373
COMPLETING DIFFERENT PHASES OF

02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:03.341
THIS PROJECT- AND LEAVING

02:18:03.408 --> 02:18:05.744
ELECTRIFICATION- FOR LATER

02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:07.445
AFTER AS YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:08.747
THE PROPOSAL THAT I HAVE MADE

02:18:08.813 --> 02:18:11.583
AND OTHERS HAVE MADE. TO SHIFT

02:18:11.650 --> 02:18:12.751
TO THE ELECTRIFICATION MONEY

02:18:12.817 --> 02:18:14.119
INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE

02:18:14.185 --> 02:18:17.756
pBACK TO ELECTRIFY THE ENTIRE

02:18:17.822 --> 02:18:19.791
SYSTEM. AND THE REASON THAT I

02:18:19.858 --> 02:18:21.593
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I WILL

02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:22.827
SAY IS SOMEONE WHO IS.

02:18:22.894 --> 02:18:24.729
CONTINUES TO BE A SUPPORTER OF

02:18:24.796 --> 02:18:26.364
HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA

02:18:26.431 --> 02:18:27.232
AND THINK THAT THIS IS AN

02:18:27.298 --> 02:18:28.366
IMPORTANT PROJECT THAT MY

02:18:28.433 --> 02:18:30.168
BIGGEST FEAR ONE OF MY BIGGEST

02:18:30.235 --> 02:18:31.503
FEARS FOR THIS PROJECT. IS THAT

02:18:31.569 --> 02:18:32.971
WE CONTINUE WITH THE DOWN THE

02:18:33.038 --> 02:18:35.573
PATH THAT WERE ON. AND COMPLETE

02:18:35.640 --> 02:18:36.975
TO THE PROJECT AS YOU'VE HAD

02:18:37.042 --> 02:18:39.044
THE OUTLINED IT. I THIS ONE

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:40.645
SECTION OF THE PROJECT IN THE

02:18:40.712 --> 02:18:43.748
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS. DON'T MATCH.

02:18:43.815 --> 02:18:45.483
THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT

02:18:45.550 --> 02:18:48.486
YOUR- ANTICIPATING IN YOUR

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.455
BUSINESS PLAN. AND THAT WE WILL

02:18:50.522 --> 02:18:51.923
HAVE TO BE SEEN TO HAVE SPENT

02:18:51.990 --> 02:18:53.692
REALLY IN IN. HUGE AMOUNT OF

02:18:53.758 --> 02:18:55.126
MONEY WHAT THE LARGEST AMOUNT

02:18:55.193 --> 02:18:56.061
OF MONEY ON A SINGLE PROJECT

02:18:56.127 --> 02:18:57.662
THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

02:18:57.729 --> 02:18:58.830
EVER DONE. AND A RIDERSHIP

02:18:58.897 --> 02:19:00.265
NUMBERS FALL SIGNIFICANTLY

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:01.533
LOWER THAN WHAT'S BEEN

02:19:01.599 --> 02:19:03.168
PROJECTED AND THE PROJECT STOPS

02:19:03.234 --> 02:19:04.869
AT THAT POINT. AND WE END UP

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.538
WITH. WHAT YOU COULD THINK OF

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:07.906
IS A BIT OF AN ORPHAN PROJECT

02:19:07.972 --> 02:19:09.708
WITH THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS

02:19:09.774 --> 02:19:13.912
NEVER COMPLETED. I STILL

02:19:13.978 --> 02:19:15.980
DO SOME MORE ANALYSIS OF THE

02:19:16.047 --> 02:19:20.085
ALTERNATIVE. OF INSTEAD OF

02:19:20.151 --> 02:19:22.854
ELECTRIFYING OUT OF WORKING ON

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:24.723
THE PROJECTS THAT- IN THE

02:19:24.789 --> 02:19:26.091
NORTHERN IN THE SOUTHERN PART

02:19:26.157 --> 02:19:27.659
OF THE STATE THAT WOULD THEN

02:19:27.726 --> 02:19:29.828
LINK. THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE

02:19:29.894 --> 02:19:31.730
BAY AREA. AND A SOUTHERN

02:19:31.796 --> 02:19:33.264
CALIFORNIA. INTO THE POPULATION

02:19:33.331 --> 02:19:35.133
AREAS WHERE WE WERE I BELIEVE

02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:36.634
WE WOULD HAVE A- BIGGER

02:19:36.701 --> 02:19:38.436
INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP IN THOSE

02:19:38.503 --> 02:19:41.239
AREAS TO SHOW THAT THERE IS

02:19:41.306 --> 02:19:42.974
PUBLIC DEMAND. FOR ALTERNATIVE

02:19:43.041 --> 02:19:44.542
TRANSPORTATION AND FOR RAIL

02:19:44.609 --> 02:19:47.011
TRANSPORTATION. THEN I BELIEVE

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:48.680
THAT IT'S EASIER TO JUSTIFY

02:19:48.747 --> 02:19:49.781
CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN THE

02:19:49.848 --> 02:19:51.082
PROJECT. WHICH YOU'RE GONNA

02:19:51.149 --> 02:19:52.617
HAVE TO DO ANYWAY BUT IF YOU

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:54.185
COMPLETE THIS SECTION. YOUR

02:19:54.252 --> 02:19:55.220
RIDERSHIP FALLS BELOW

02:19:55.286 --> 02:19:56.621
EXPECTATIONS AND I THINK WILL

02:19:56.688 --> 02:19:58.923
BE VERY HARD. TO GO BACK TO THE

02:19:58.990 --> 02:20:00.125
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO

02:20:00.191 --> 02:20:02.460
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:04.295
ASK THEM FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF

02:20:04.362 --> 02:20:05.497
ADDITIONAL. YOU INVESTING IN

02:20:05.563 --> 02:20:08.399
THE PROPER. SOME OF THE OTHER

02:20:08.466 --> 02:20:10.001
ASSERTIONS THAT I HEARD WAS YOU

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.503
KNOW A SECRETARY KIM WHEN HE

02:20:11.569 --> 02:20:12.670
WAS SPEAKING ABOUT GHG

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:13.538
REDUCTIONS ABOUT THE

02:20:13.605 --> 02:20:15.840
TRANSPORTATION SECTION SECTOR

02:20:15.907 --> 02:20:17.242
BEING WITH THE ONE AREA WHERE

02:20:17.308 --> 02:20:18.276
WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE

02:20:18.343 --> 02:20:19.444
WRONG DIRECTION WITH GREENHOUSE

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:21.846
GAS REDUCTIONS THAT'S ALL TRUE

02:20:21.913 --> 02:20:24.649
BUT WE DON'T GET REDUCTIONS IN

02:20:24.716 --> 02:20:25.917
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS FROM

02:20:25.984 --> 02:20:27.552
TRANSPORTATION BY SWITCHING

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:29.354
FROM DIESEL TO ELECT A LECTURE

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:31.055
CALL WE GET SOME SMALL AMOUNT.

02:20:31.122 --> 02:20:32.423
WE GET ACTIONS AND GROUP HOUSE

02:20:32.490 --> 02:20:34.325
GASES BY GETTING PEOPLE OF

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:36.361
AUTOMOBILES ON TO TRAINS THAT'S

02:20:36.427 --> 02:20:36.861
WHERE YOU REALLY GET THE

02:20:36.928 --> 02:20:39.264
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND I

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:42.500
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO. DO

02:20:42.567 --> 02:20:44.035
A LOT MORE ANALYSIS ON THESE

02:20:44.102 --> 02:20:45.737
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THEY ARE

02:20:45.804 --> 02:20:47.806
BASED ON MULTIPLE TRIPS PER DAY

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:49.340
IN THE SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW

02:20:49.407 --> 02:20:50.508
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING

02:20:50.575 --> 02:20:52.043
THE AMOUNT OF TRAINS PER DAY.

02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:53.244
THAT YOU'RE BASING YOUR

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:55.680
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ON. I DON'T

02:20:55.747 --> 02:20:57.482
BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FULLY

02:20:57.549 --> 02:20:59.050
EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF

02:20:59.117 --> 02:21:01.119
TRANSFERS ON RIDERSHIP NUMBERS

02:21:01.186 --> 02:21:02.353
AND WE'VE HEARD WE HEARD TODAY

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:05.223
FROM. OF DR BRIAN TAYLOR FROM

02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:07.125
UCLA ABOUT THE IMPACT OF

02:21:07.192 --> 02:21:09.894
TRANSFERS. A GIVEN THAT WERE

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:11.629
STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT. WHAT THE

02:21:11.696 --> 02:21:13.031
TRANSFERS WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF

02:21:13.097 --> 02:21:14.265
HOW MANY TRAINS A DAY THEY'LL

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:17.001
BE ABLE TO TRANSFER TO- THE

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:19.237
SPEED OF THOSE TRAINS. ALL OF

02:21:19.304 --> 02:21:23.174
THAT IS STILL VERY UNCLEAR. I

02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:24.342
THINK THAT WE NEED TO AT THIS

02:21:24.409 --> 02:21:25.877
POINT HAVE A BIT OF A PAUSE FOR

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:28.146
WE ARE VALUE WAIT BILL. REALLY

02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:30.114
SHINE A MICROSCOPE ON THOSE

02:21:30.181 --> 02:21:34.185
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS AND ON THE-

02:21:34.252 --> 02:21:36.354
BASIS BY WHICH- THEY WERE

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:38.523
CALCULATED AYE I ASKED A LOT OF

02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:39.123
QUESTIONS IN THE LAST HEARING

02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:40.892
THAT WE HAD WHEN WE ALL MET. IN

02:21:40.959 --> 02:21:43.628
THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I GET A

02:21:43.695 --> 02:21:44.195
LOT OF WHAT I THOUGHT WERE

02:21:44.262 --> 02:21:45.463
SATISFACTORY ANSWER OF WHERE

02:21:45.530 --> 02:21:46.865
SOME OF THOSE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:49.267
WERE BEING GENERATED FROM AND

02:21:49.334 --> 02:21:50.935
I'M NOT THAT THE ACTION STILL.

02:21:51.002 --> 02:21:53.905
ARE IS TRUE RIGHT NOW IS THEY

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:55.139
WORK THE TERM. I KNOW I WOULD

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:56.241
TO SEE YOU KNOW A MORE DRILL

02:21:56.307 --> 02:22:00.445
DOWN ON THAT- GIVEN THE CURRENT

02:22:00.511 --> 02:22:02.413
CONFIGURATION OF THE PROJECT

02:22:02.480 --> 02:22:03.448
THE TIME TABLE AND EVERYTHING

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:05.316
ELSE. AND LOOKING TO SEE IF

02:22:05.383 --> 02:22:07.118
THOSE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE

02:22:07.185 --> 02:22:12.457
STILL JUSTIFIED. BECAUSE AGAIN

02:22:12.523 --> 02:22:18.429
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT- THE- THE

02:22:18.496 --> 02:22:20.431
NEXT STEP OF TRYING TO GET THE

02:22:20.498 --> 02:22:23.368
NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING AFTER

02:22:23.434 --> 02:22:24.569
THIS TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT.

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.304
YEAH I IF WE HAVE A PROJECT

02:22:26.371 --> 02:22:28.206
THAT ONLY RUNS FOR MERCED TO

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:29.340
BAKERSFIELD YOU KNOW YOU SURE

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:31.309
THAT'S NOT HORRIBLE BUT THAT'S

02:22:31.376 --> 02:22:32.377
NOT WHAT WAS TOLD TO THE PEOPLE

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:33.778
OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT WHAT

02:22:33.845 --> 02:22:35.380
THEY WERE INVESTING IN WHEN

02:22:35.446 --> 02:22:36.748
THEY VOTED FOR THIS PROPOSITION

02:22:36.814 --> 02:22:38.349
THEY WERE VOTING FOR A SYSTEM

02:22:38.416 --> 02:22:39.250
THAT GOES UP AND DOWN THE STE

02:22:39.317 --> 02:22:40.618
FULL STATE OF CALIFORNIANS

02:22:40.685 --> 02:22:41.853
CERTAINLY INTO THE BAY AREA.

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:43.154
AND I WOULD ARGUE YOUR OWN

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:44.489
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE BASED ON

02:22:44.555 --> 02:22:46.591
GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE BAY

02:22:46.658 --> 02:22:49.761
AREA NOT JUST BETWEEN NOT JUST

02:22:49.827 --> 02:22:50.495
THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY

02:22:50.561 --> 02:22:53.464
AS FAR AS I SEE IT AND I COULD

02:22:53.531 --> 02:22:54.632
BE I MEAN IF I'M WRONG ABOUT

02:22:54.699 --> 02:22:56.601
THAT PLEASE CORRECT. MY CONCERN

02:22:56.668 --> 02:22:59.971
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. OF A

02:23:00.038 --> 02:23:01.706
FULL REPORT FROM YOU ON

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:05.043
RIDERSHIP NUMBERS- BASED ON THE

02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:06.778
NUMBER OF TRIPS PER DAY THE

02:23:06.844 --> 02:23:08.146
YOU'RE YOU'RE ANTICIPATING AT

02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:11.449
THIS POINT ON THE DESTINATIONS.

02:23:11.516 --> 02:23:12.917
ON WHATEVER WHATEVER OTHER

02:23:12.984 --> 02:23:18.656
OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE.

02:23:18.723 --> 02:23:20.091
I THINK THAT WE NEED THAT- WE

02:23:20.158 --> 02:23:20.992
DESERVE THAT BEFORE WE GO

02:23:21.059 --> 02:23:23.161
FORWARD AND WE DON'T WE ALSO

02:23:23.227 --> 02:23:24.796
SHOULD HAVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH

02:23:24.862 --> 02:23:26.164
THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WILL BE

02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:28.066
ON CLEANER THIRD GENERATION

02:23:28.132 --> 02:23:30.868
DIESEL FAST TRAINS- WITH YOUR

02:23:30.935 --> 02:23:33.438
NEW RULE- NEW TRACKS SO RATHER

02:23:33.504 --> 02:23:34.939
THAN LOOKING AT RIDERSHIP

02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:37.842
NUMBERS THAT ARE- SIMPLY EMPTY.

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:39.644
VERSUS HIGH SPEED RIGHT OF THIS

02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:41.179
WHAT OTHER OPTION OF A SINGLE

02:23:41.245 --> 02:23:43.614
SEAT RIDE FROM BAKERSFIELD ALL

02:23:43.681 --> 02:23:44.882
THE WAY UP TO THE BAY AREA

02:23:44.949 --> 02:23:46.784
VERSES THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:23:46.851 --> 02:23:48.186
LECTER FIGHT HAVING TO CHANGE

02:23:48.252 --> 02:23:49.954
TRAINS I THINK THAT'S REALLY

02:23:50.021 --> 02:23:51.055
THE COMPARISON OF RIDERSHIP

02:23:51.122 --> 02:23:54.692
THAT WE NEED TO SEE- BEFORE WE

02:23:54.759 --> 02:23:55.827
DECIDE ON WHAT THIS INVESTMENT-

02:23:55.893 --> 02:23:58.229
SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD. WORK

02:23:58.296 --> 02:24:00.031
CRUCIAL STAGE IN THIS PROJECT

02:24:00.098 --> 02:24:02.066
AND WHAT WE DO NOT IT'S GOING

02:24:02.133 --> 02:24:03.201
TO HAVE A HUGE BEAR ON THE- OF

02:24:03.267 --> 02:24:05.536
THIS PROJECT AND HOW. PLEASE

02:24:05.603 --> 02:24:06.371
PEOPLE IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS

02:24:06.437 --> 02:24:08.506
LOOK BACK ON THE INVESTMENTS

02:24:08.573 --> 02:24:09.140
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.009
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THIS

02:24:11.075 --> 02:24:12.844
WRONG. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING.

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.245
THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING OF

02:24:14.312 --> 02:24:15.813
AT THIS POINT AND HOW EVERY

02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:17.548
DOLLAR THAT'S SPENT IS GOING TO

02:24:17.615 --> 02:24:19.150
BE SCRUTINIZED. THIS YEAR AND

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:20.952
NEXT YEAR GOING FORWARD WE HAVE

02:24:21.019 --> 02:24:21.919
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN JUST

02:24:21.986 --> 02:24:23.221
BY EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR AND

02:24:23.287 --> 02:24:24.355
WHERE THOSE INVESTMENTS GO. AND

02:24:24.422 --> 02:24:26.057
I WOULD STILL ARGUE THAT

02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:28.426
THERE'S A BIG CASE TO BE MADE

02:24:28.493 --> 02:24:30.261
FOR INVESTING MORE IN. LAYING

02:24:30.328 --> 02:24:31.963
THE FUTURE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:33.731
IN OUR POPULATION CENTERS WHILE

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.867
ALSO ENJOYING THE CO BENEFITS.

02:24:35.933 --> 02:24:37.502
OF HAVING MUCH BETTER IMPROVE

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:39.937
SERVICE FOR. RELATIONS CENTERS.

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:41.506
AND GETTING A LOT MORE PEOPLE

02:24:41.572 --> 02:24:44.742
OUT OF THEIR CARS- AND- GETTING

02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:47.645
PEOPLE THEMSELVES DEMAND.

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:48.946
BETTER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS

02:24:49.013 --> 02:24:49.480
UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF

02:24:49.547 --> 02:24:51.449
CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT I WILL

02:25:03.828 --> 02:25:05.730
QUESTIONS DIRECTED AT THE

02:25:05.797 --> 02:25:08.099
POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS THAT THIS

02:25:08.166 --> 02:25:10.134
PROJECT MIGHT BE FACING- IN

02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:12.870
PARTICULAR. WHETHER CERTAIN

FEDERAL OPERATING SUBSIDY. THAT

02:26:04.055 --> 02:26:05.990
APPEARS TO ME TO BE A FAIRLY

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:08.960
EXPLICIT BAN ON TAXPAYER

02:26:09.026 --> 02:26:10.761
OPERATING SUBSIDIES. SO MY

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:13.131
FIRST QUESTION OF YOU TODAY IS

02:26:13.197 --> 02:26:14.999
WILL THE PLANNED INITIAL

02:26:15.066 --> 02:26:16.000

TAXPAYERS YES OR NO. YES BUT

02:26:25.643 --> 02:26:26.177
LOWER THAN WHAT THE TAXPAYERS

02:26:26.244 --> 02:26:29.580
ARE PAYING TODAY. DOES THAT

02:26:29.647 --> 02:26:31.349
CAUSE CONCERN FOR YOU OR YOUR

02:26:31.415 --> 02:26:32.750
LAWYERS THAT ARE ADVISING YOU

02:26:32.817 --> 02:26:35.987
THAT IF. AS YOU JUST SAID IT

02:26:36.053 --> 02:26:37.688
WILL REQUIRE AN OPERATING SAYS

02:26:37.755 --> 02:26:39.891
SUBSIDY DOES THAT DOES THAT NOT

02:26:39.957 --> 02:26:41.159
CONFLICT WITH THE EXPLICIT

02:26:41.225 --> 02:26:43.327
LANGUAGE I JUST READ FROM THE

02:26:43.394 --> 02:26:45.062
PROPOSITION ONE A BOND. I DON'T

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.397
THINK SO I THINK SO MISTER

02:26:46.464 --> 02:26:48.266
CUNNINGHAM OF THE REASON THAT

02:26:48.332 --> 02:26:50.368
WE DON'T THINK SO IS BECAUSE-

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:52.136
UNDER THE MODEL THAT WE'RE

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:52.970
USING THE VALLEY WE ARE NOT THE

02:26:53.037 --> 02:26:55.473
OPERATOR- WE WOULD WE ALL WE

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:57.508
ALL THE ASSETS. THAT WOULD BE

02:26:57.575 --> 02:26:59.844
LEAST BY ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY

02:26:59.911 --> 02:27:00.811
WHO WILL CONTRACT WITH AN

02:27:00.878 --> 02:27:03.047
OPERATOR- TO RUN THE SYSTEM.

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:07.385
AND SO- THAT IS NOT- OPERATED

02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:08.953
BY US AND JUST. I THINK PROVIDE

02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:12.890
A FAIR. SORT OF COMPARISON HERE

02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:13.624
ON SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING

02:27:13.691 --> 02:27:16.260
TODAY. BUT IN CALIFORNIA BOTH

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:19.096
WITH THE- RECOGNITION AND EVEN

02:27:19.163 --> 02:27:20.097
THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE

02:27:20.164 --> 02:27:22.066
LEGISLATURE. IS YOU KNOW RIGHT

02:27:22.133 --> 02:27:24.802
NOW WE USE PROP ONE EIGHT

02:27:24.869 --> 02:27:27.238
DOLLARS- TO ELECTRIFY THE

02:27:27.305 --> 02:27:29.540
SEGMENT. OF THE CALTRAIN CORD

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:32.410
OR THE BAY AREA- BUT- THE

02:27:32.476 --> 02:27:34.245
INCUMBENT OPERATOR IS OPERATING

02:27:34.312 --> 02:27:37.515
ON THAT SYSTEM. BUT NOT US- IN

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:39.450
SO- IN THAT CASE WERE USING

02:27:39.517 --> 02:27:40.718
PROP ONE EIGHT DOLLARS TO

02:27:40.785 --> 02:27:42.920
ELECTRIFY. A SEGMENT IN THE BAY

02:27:42.987 --> 02:27:44.989
AREA TO PROVIDE ELECTRIFIED

02:27:45.056 --> 02:27:47.959
SERVICE PROVIDED BY ANOTHER-

02:27:48.025 --> 02:27:50.228
AND THAT'S NOT A VERY DIFFERENT

02:27:50.294 --> 02:27:51.729
THAN WHAT WE ARE. PROPOSING THE

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:54.398
CELL IN THE- IN THE ABSENT

02:27:54.465 --> 02:27:56.400
ABOUT. SO IT DOES NOT BECAUSE

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:57.935
YOU OR YOUR LEGAL TEAM

02:27:58.002 --> 02:27:59.904
CONCERNED THAT THE- PROP ONE A

02:27:59.971 --> 02:28:02.406
BOND ACT LANGUAGE SAYS- TRAIN

02:28:02.473 --> 02:28:04.108
SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE

02:28:04.175 --> 02:28:07.144
AUTHORITY. FOR PURSUANT TO ITS

02:28:07.211 --> 02:28:09.313
AUTHORITY. SO IF YOU'RE YEAH I

02:28:09.380 --> 02:28:10.281
THINK THAT REFERENCE TO

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:13.284
PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY- AND

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:14.852
I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT A LAWYER-

02:28:14.919 --> 02:28:16.554
BUT I THINK IT IS A REFERENCE

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:19.056
TO. A SECTION OF LAW THAT SAYS

02:28:19.123 --> 02:28:20.958
YOU KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:28:21.025 --> 02:28:23.828
AUTHORITY HAS SORT OF OUR MODEL

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:26.497
FORTY UP UNDER THE- CALIFORNIA

STATUTES FOR ANY DRAIN SERVICE

02:28:28.032 --> 02:28:29.267
OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

02:28:29.333 --> 02:28:30.835
MILES PER HOUR. SO I THINK

02:28:30.901 --> 02:28:32.536
THAT'S THE REFERENCE THERE- BUT

02:28:32.603 --> 02:28:34.338
AGAIN IT'S WE'RE NOT RELYING ON

02:28:34.405 --> 02:28:37.742
THAT AUTHORITY TO. PROVIDE

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:38.342
SERVICE HERE WHAT WE'RE SAYING

02:28:38.409 --> 02:28:40.444
IS- WE'RE GONNA BILLS OF ASSETS

02:28:40.511 --> 02:28:42.246
THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE

02:28:42.313 --> 02:28:44.115
TO PUT INTO USE A RELATIVELY

02:28:44.181 --> 02:28:48.085

02:28:48.152 --> 02:28:50.388
THAT EXISTING PROVIDER THOSE

02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:51.622
ASSETS CAN ELECTRIFIED THAT

02:28:51.689 --> 02:28:53.457
PROVIDE. I CAN'T PROVIDE

02:28:53.524 --> 02:28:55.359
SERVICE ON THAT SYSTEM WHICH

02:28:55.426 --> 02:28:57.161
AGAIN IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S

02:28:57.228 --> 02:29:01.832
GOING ON IN THE AREA WITH A

02:29:01.899 --> 02:29:04.135
CALTRAIN. OKAY IT DOES NOT

02:29:04.201 --> 02:29:05.770
BECAUSE YOU'RE TEAM SOME STERN

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:07.138
THE- THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS A

02:29:07.204 --> 02:29:09.073
WORK AROUND AROUND THE EXPLICIT

02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:12.476
LANGUAGE OF THAT I JUST READ OF.

02:29:12.543 --> 02:29:13.978
THE AUTHORIZING BOND ACT

02:29:14.045 --> 02:29:15.980
BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL.

WE'RE GOING TO CONTRACT WITH

02:29:17.081 --> 02:29:18.616
THE THIRD PARTY AND LET THE

02:29:18.683 --> 02:29:20.117
THIRD PARTY OPERATED THEREFORE

02:29:20.184 --> 02:29:22.420
WE CAN USE TAX- SUBSIDIES TO

02:29:22.486 --> 02:29:24.288
OPERATE IT. I AND I WOULD NOTE

02:29:24.355 --> 02:29:26.223
YEAH THAT YET AGAIN TO BE FAIR

02:29:26.290 --> 02:29:27.425
SICKENING TAXPAYERS ARE

02:29:27.491 --> 02:29:29.427
SUBSIDIZING. THE SAN JOAQUIN

02:29:29.493 --> 02:29:31.762

ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND

02:29:35.099 --> 02:29:37.134
WHAT WHAT WE ARE NUMBERS SHOW

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:39.503
THAT IF- WORKING WAS SAN

02:29:39.570 --> 02:29:41.005

02:29:49.613 --> 02:29:51.349
CONTRACTING WITH THE OPERATOR.

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:52.850
OF PROVIDING THAT SERVICE IS

02:29:52.917 --> 02:29:53.718
NOT A QUIRK AROUND IT'S IN

02:29:53.784 --> 02:29:56.020
COMPLIANCE WITH PROP ONE DAY

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:58.289
WAS THAT AND SO WITH NATURAL IN

02:29:58.356 --> 02:29:59.523
COURT DO YOU HAVE A LEGAL

02:29:59.590 --> 02:30:01.192
OPINION THAT SAYS THAT THAT

02:30:01.258 --> 02:30:06.364
WAS- CONSISTENT WITH THE

02:30:06.430 --> 02:30:07.431
LANGUAGE IN THE BOND ACT. IT IS

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:11.869
NOT A- IT'S NOT JONES. SO I.

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:15.005
THAT THIS THIS NEW PLAN WILL

02:30:15.072 --> 02:30:15.573
GET CHEN AND WORRY ABOUT THA

02:30:15.639 --> 02:30:16.340
BECAUSE TODAY THERE WAS AN LA

02:30:16.407 --> 02:30:17.842
TIMES ARE. WORK KOPP. OF FORMER

02:30:17.908 --> 02:30:19.777

02:30:25.516 --> 02:30:27.084
TIMES TODAY AND I QUOTE IT

02:30:27.151 --> 02:30:28.152
DEFIES THE BALLOT MEASURE

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:29.954
APPROVED BY VOTERS. AND YOU

02:30:30.020 --> 02:30:31.288

02:30:31.355 --> 02:30:33.057
LAWSUIT AND I WANT TO BE THE

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:34.091
LEAD PLAINTIFF. I THINK YOU'VE

02:30:34.158 --> 02:30:35.960
GOT A POTENTIALLY CHALLENGE

02:30:36.026 --> 02:30:37.461
COMING AND SO THAT LEADS TO MY

02:30:37.528 --> 02:30:39.363
NEXT QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENS IF

02:30:39.430 --> 02:30:40.097
YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS

02:30:40.164 --> 02:30:41.832
BUSINESS PLAN. AND A COURT

02:30:41.899 --> 02:30:43.667
RULES AGAINST THE AUTHORITY

02:30:43.734 --> 02:30:45.503
THAT. THE BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED

02:30:45.569 --> 02:30:47.171
LINE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE

02:30:47.238 --> 02:30:48.939
BOND FUNDS WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE%

02:30:49.006 --> 02:30:51.008
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THEN DO YOU

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:54.812
HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN. I MEAN

02:30:54.879 --> 02:30:56.280
THERE'S A LOT IF THEY'RE- IN

02:30:56.347 --> 02:30:57.648
AGAIN WE FEEL PRETTY

02:30:57.715 --> 02:30:58.716
COMFORTABLE NOT WAS STANDING

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:01.318
WITH. A JUDGE COP. AHEAD IS A I

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:02.520

ABOUT THE- STRUCTURE OF THE- OF

02:31:05.990 --> 02:31:06.690
THE PROGRAM IN THE CENTRAL

02:31:06.757 --> 02:31:08.726
VALLEY- THE IDEA THAT WE ARE

02:31:08.793 --> 02:31:10.261
NOT THE OPERATOR I THINK THAT'S

02:31:10.327 --> 02:31:12.229
A- AN IMPERATIVE POINT. I THINK

02:31:12.296 --> 02:31:13.164
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL

02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:16.167
OF THIS- SO- YOU KNOW I DO I

02:31:16.233 --> 02:31:17.835

02:31:25.509 --> 02:31:26.010
OF LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER THE

02:31:26.076 --> 02:31:27.878
YEARS- LEGAL CHALLENGE ABOUT

02:31:27.945 --> 02:31:29.380
HOW IT WAS BEING SPENT HAS BEEN

02:31:29.447 --> 02:31:31.115
APPROPRIATED. ENVIRONMENTAL

02:31:31.182 --> 02:31:33.384
CHALLENGES AND- YOU KNOW WE

02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:35.252
WORK THROUGH THEM- WHICH

02:31:35.319 --> 02:31:36.454
SETTLED ALL LITIGATION ON THE

02:31:36.520 --> 02:31:38.322
ENVIRONMENTAL FRONT TODAY. AND

02:31:46.330 --> 02:31:52.369
THAT WE'RE FOR SO I HAVE A

02:31:52.436 --> 02:31:53.704
CONTINGENCY PLAN TO MY BECAUSE

02:31:53.771 --> 02:31:55.973
AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE WE

02:31:56.040 --> 02:31:57.074
NEED TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD I. WE

02:31:57.141 --> 02:32:00.845
FEEL LIKE WE ARE. MEETING THE

02:32:00.911 --> 02:32:02.346
LETTER OF THE LAW CERTAINLY A

02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:07.885
PROP ON A. AND THAT THIS MODEL

02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:11.989
BY THE WAY. NOT A MODEL THAT

02:32:12.056 --> 02:32:13.791
THEN PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE

02:32:13.858 --> 02:32:16.727

OPERATE SPEED RAIL SERVICE AN

02:32:32.009 --> 02:32:34.278
INTERN MATTER AND WE GET BUILD

02:32:38.182 --> 02:32:40.417
OPERATOR IN SO IT'S AN INTERIM

02:32:40.484 --> 02:32:43.020
SERVICE AND AGAIN THIS MODEL IS

02:32:43.087 --> 02:32:44.355
BEING EXECUTED OTHER PARTS OF

02:32:44.421 --> 02:32:46.257
THE STATE TODAY. SO WHAT I'M

02:32:46.323 --> 02:32:47.391
HEARING FROM ME THOUGH IS THAT

02:32:47.458 --> 02:32:48.559
WHILE WE'RE DOING IT IN OTHER

02:32:48.626 --> 02:32:50.494
PLACES SO IT MUST BE CORRECT

02:32:50.561 --> 02:32:51.762
BUT YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S

02:32:51.829 --> 02:32:53.364
NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT

02:32:53.430 --> 02:32:55.799
BEFORE AND OF THIS TYPE OF

02:32:55.866 --> 02:32:57.434
LEGAL CHALLENGES DIFFERENT THAN

02:32:57.501 --> 02:33:01.805
ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUIT THIS GOES

02:33:01.872 --> 02:33:02.806
TO THE FUNDAMENTAL. VOTERS BUT

02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:05.009
THEY WERE. TOLD HAPPEN AND WHAT

02:33:05.075 --> 02:33:05.643
THE TOLD WOULD HAVE INTO EIGHT

02:33:05.709 --> 02:33:06.544
WHEN THEY VOTE. TO ENACT THE

02:33:06.610 --> 02:33:08.579
PROP ONE A BOND ACT. TO BUILD

02:33:08.646 --> 02:33:10.548
THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS

02:33:10.614 --> 02:33:12.516
THAT TAXPAYER MONEY WOULD NOT

02:33:12.583 --> 02:33:14.351
BE USED FOR OPERATING SUBSIDY.

02:33:14.418 --> 02:33:15.486
THAT'S AT LEAST AS I READ THE

02:33:15.553 --> 02:33:17.888
PLAIN LANGUAGE OR SO I SUGGEST

02:33:17.955 --> 02:33:19.456
YOU HAVE A LAWSUIT COMING. SO

02:33:19.523 --> 02:33:21.959
YOU MAY WANT TO COULD DEVELOP A

02:33:22.026 --> 02:33:24.695
CONTINGENCY PLAN. FOR BECAUSE

02:33:24.762 --> 02:33:26.597
IN MY VIEW AS AN ATTORNEY AND

02:33:26.664 --> 02:33:27.932
IN THE VIEW OF CLINTON COP WHO

02:33:27.998 --> 02:33:29.133
WAS AFTER ALL THE FORMER

02:33:29.199 --> 02:33:29.934
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.202
DIRECTORS- YOU'VE GOT A

02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:33.904
PROBLEM. ON THE LEGAL AND- OF I

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:35.005
DON'T KNOW WHICH LAWYERS YOU'RE

02:33:35.072 --> 02:33:36.574
TALKING TO BUT I THEY SHOULD BE

02:33:36.640 --> 02:33:37.641
TELLING YOU YOU GOT A PROBLEM.

02:33:37.708 --> 02:33:39.843
SO THE OTHER THING YOU COULD DO

02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:42.212
IS GIVEN THE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY

02:33:42.279 --> 02:33:44.014
AND THEREFORE THE LEGAL RISK

02:33:44.081 --> 02:33:44.949
AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:33:45.015 --> 02:33:46.350
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS IS IN

02:33:46.417 --> 02:33:48.819
A SMALL THING. ARE YOU COULD

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:51.188
FIRST SEEK LEGAL CLARIFICATION

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:54.058
EITHER FROM THE COURTS. FOR

02:33:54.124 --> 02:33:56.060
LEGISLATIVE CLARIFICATION AS TO

02:33:56.126 --> 02:33:57.461
THE INTENT OF THE BOND LANGUAGE

02:33:57.528 --> 02:33:58.529
BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT WAS THE

02:33:58.596 --> 02:33:59.863
LEGISLATURE THE PUT THE BOND ON

02:33:59.930 --> 02:34:01.699
THE BALLOT. AND WE HAVE A BILL

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:03.400
THAT WE JUST MOVED OUT OF THIS

02:34:03.467 --> 02:34:05.436
COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD. CLARIFY

02:34:05.502 --> 02:34:07.404
THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:08.772
WHAT IT WOULD SAY IF IT WAS

02:34:08.839 --> 02:34:11.842
ENACTED INTO LAW. IS UP THAT

02:34:11.909 --> 02:34:13.377
THIS LANGUAGE MEANS WHAT IT

02:34:13.444 --> 02:34:14.912
SAYS AND YOU CAN'T DO A WORK

02:34:14.979 --> 02:34:15.913
AROUND BY PUTTING SOMEONE

02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:18.082
ELSE'S DECALS ON THE TRAIN. AND

02:34:18.148 --> 02:34:21.385
SAY THAT THERE THE OPERATOR. UP

02:34:21.452 --> 02:34:23.921
SO. I YELP FORTUNATELY I

02:34:23.988 --> 02:34:27.091
REMEMBER FIRST. SORRY WELL I

02:34:27.157 --> 02:34:28.025
MEAN TO BE TOTALLY CANDID I

02:34:28.092 --> 02:34:32.796
MEAN. YOU KNOW. IT IT AT MY

02:34:32.863 --> 02:34:33.964
CENTRAL CO NOBODY'S EVER AYE

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:38.469
THIS ALL PAY FOR FOREVER THE-

02:34:38.535 --> 02:34:40.004
AS OTHER QUESTIONS APPOINT OUT

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:42.139
THE CO OVER ON THIS. OR STAFF.

02:34:42.206 --> 02:34:44.074
AND ONYX THE SCOPES BEING

02:34:44.141 --> 02:34:45.743
SCALED DOWN THE COST GOES UP

02:34:45.809 --> 02:34:47.978
EVERYTIME WE TURN AROUND- I

02:34:48.045 --> 02:34:49.680
WOULD BE PERFECTLY CONTENT AS

02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:51.482
WITH MOST OF MY CONSTITUENTS IF

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:53.484
YOU LOST THIS LEGAL CHALLENGE.

02:34:53.550 --> 02:34:54.385
BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

02:34:54.451 --> 02:34:56.654
MAKING IT WORK I THINK YOU NEED

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:58.922
TO DRILL DOWN ON THESE ISSUES

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:01.925
OR LET THE LEGISLATURE TAKE THE

02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:02.459
LEAD IN CLARIFYING THE LAW

02:35:02.526 --> 02:35:03.293
MEANS ORGANIT. THE CLERK

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.029
JUDGMENT FROM THE COURT THAT

SAYS THAT YOU CAN PROCEED IN A

02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:07.097
MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:10.968
THE BOND ACT BECAUSE I

02:35:11.035 --> 02:35:11.502
PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE

FOR WHY. YOU MAY BE MOVING

02:40:15.973 --> 02:40:17.407
FORWARD WITH THE CONTRACT AND

02:40:17.474 --> 02:40:19.409
STATES THE TRACKING SYSTEM

02:40:19.476 --> 02:40:21.311
CONTRACT HAS A MECHANISM FOR

02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:23.213
DETERMINING THE CAPITAL COST OF

02:40:23.280 --> 02:40:25.048
ALL SEGMENTS AFTER THE FIRST

02:40:25.115 --> 02:40:26.516
SEGMENT. WHICH INCLUDES A

02:40:26.583 --> 02:40:29.820
BASKET OF INDEXATION FACTORS

02:40:29.886 --> 02:40:32.255
RELATING TO INFLATION FOR LABOR

02:40:32.322 --> 02:40:34.358
AND MATERIALS. SO THIS COULD

02:40:34.424 --> 02:40:35.625
INCENTIVIZE THE AUTHORITY TO

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:38.095
TAKE ADDITIONAL RISK BY ISSUING

02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:40.130
A NOTICE TO PROCEED PREMATURELY

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:42.532
IN ORDER TO SECURE. A LOWER

02:40:42.599 --> 02:40:44.935
PRICE DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT TO

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:46.336
YOU OR WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

02:40:46.403 --> 02:40:51.942
ON THIS. BE CLEAR NOT IT'S BEEN

02:40:52.009 --> 02:40:53.744
A WHILE STILL LOOK AT THAT

02:40:53.810 --> 02:40:54.244
SPECIFIC SECTION OF THAT

02:40:54.311 --> 02:40:56.146
REPORT- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY

02:40:56.213 --> 02:40:58.615
THAT ONE. OF GETTING THE MO YOU

02:40:58.682 --> 02:41:00.317
IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE EXCUSE OF

02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:01.718
THE CONTRACT IS A GOOD

02:41:01.785 --> 02:41:03.320
RECOMMENDATION OF ONE OF THAT

02:41:03.387 --> 02:41:06.490
WE ARE WORKING ON. OF A AND B.

02:41:06.556 --> 02:41:07.858
THAT THE CONTRACT IS STRUCTURED

02:41:07.924 --> 02:41:10.627
IN A WAY WHERE- IT'S ALL SET ON

02:41:10.694 --> 02:41:12.929
NOTICES TO PERCY- THE FIRST

02:41:12.996 --> 02:41:14.331
NOTICE TO PROCEED IS GETTING

02:41:14.398 --> 02:41:15.499
THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE

02:41:15.565 --> 02:41:17.234
TRACK. PUT DOWN AND THE REASON

02:41:17.300 --> 02:41:18.835
THAT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD

02:41:18.902 --> 02:41:19.870
WITH THAT IS BECAUSE THAT IS A

02:41:19.936 --> 02:41:21.471
REQUIREMENT UNDER OUR FEDERAL

02:41:21.538 --> 02:41:23.607
FUND A FUNDING AGREEMENT. BUT

02:41:23.673 --> 02:41:25.342
TO GET THIS WORK COMPLETED BY

02:41:25.409 --> 02:41:27.344
THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO

02:41:27.411 --> 02:41:28.512
AND SO THERE'S A REASON FOR US

02:41:28.578 --> 02:41:30.781
TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CONTRACT

02:41:30.847 --> 02:41:32.149
I THINK THE PROTECTION ELEMENT

02:41:32.215 --> 02:41:34.384
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IS- OUR

02:41:34.451 --> 02:41:35.986
BOARD PUBLICLY ASKED TO

02:41:36.053 --> 02:41:39.056
APPROVE. THE NEXT NTP IT EACH

02:41:39.122 --> 02:41:41.458
AND BE UP BEFORE WE DO IT'S OR

02:41:41.525 --> 02:41:42.793
BOARD WILL HAVE A CHANCE WE

02:41:42.859 --> 02:41:45.562
WILL HAVE A PUBLIC DISCUSSION-

02:41:45.629 --> 02:41:47.164
IN OUR HEARINGS ABOUT. THE IS

02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:50.000
IT READY IS FUNDING AVAILABLE-

02:41:50.067 --> 02:41:51.134
IS THE WORK ON THE GROUND DONE

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:54.671
TO ENABLE THIS WORK TO BE DONE.

02:41:54.738 --> 02:41:57.040
EVERY OF THAT THE IS ANOTHER

02:41:57.107 --> 02:42:00.110
NOTICE TO PROCEED ANTI. THAT

02:42:00.177 --> 02:42:02.312
HAS TO GO TO WAR WAR. AND THEY

02:42:02.379 --> 02:42:03.980
WILL NOT A PER IT HELLO BINDING

02:42:04.047 --> 02:42:05.816
IS A- AND THE WORK ON THE- IS

02:42:05.882 --> 02:42:09.186
COMPLETED TO DO TO A TO EXECUTE

02:42:09.252 --> 02:42:10.954
THAT WORK SO WE ARE IN A PLACE

02:42:11.021 --> 02:42:12.322
WHERE WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET THE

02:42:12.389 --> 02:42:14.224
TRACK DOWN WE GOTTA GET. A

02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:16.026
TRACK CONTRACT THE GOING

02:42:16.093 --> 02:42:17.027
BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEDERAL

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:18.695
REQUIREMENT TO DO SO THAT'S

02:42:18.762 --> 02:42:20.997
JUST ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:26.903
AND THAT HE THE FOR MILES. OF

02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:29.873
THIS PENDING CONTRA. BUT EVERY.

02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:33.009
THING IS A SECTION NOTICED A

02:42:33.076 --> 02:42:36.012
PER. THAT NOT GO FORWARD IF

02:42:36.079 --> 02:42:39.683
WE'RE NOT. OF READY TO MOVE AND

02:42:39.749 --> 02:42:41.718
SO I THINK THERE'S A BILL TO BE

02:42:41.785 --> 02:42:44.054
CAUTIOUS APPROACH AS WE AS WE

02:42:44.121 --> 02:42:46.990
GO FOR. WHY AT THE SAME TIME

02:42:47.057 --> 02:42:47.858
GETTING THE TRACK. ON THE

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:49.793
GROUND. OR PURSE. TO OUR

02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:51.561
FEDERAL FOR. AND I WOULD SAY

02:42:51.628 --> 02:42:53.363
ONE THE THINGS IS. I KNOW IT'S

02:42:53.430 --> 02:42:53.964
BEEN CONVERSE. ABOUT WHETHER

02:42:54.030 --> 02:42:56.032
THE SHOULD BE. ELECTRIFIED OR

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:58.235
SYSTEM OR NOT. IN OUR VIEW. OF

02:42:58.301 --> 02:42:59.603
THE SHOULD BE A CONSIST WITH

02:42:59.669 --> 02:43:01.638
THE- RITUAL FOR PLAN. FOR THIS

02:43:01.705 --> 02:43:04.241
ACT THAT WAS. BY IN TWENTY AND

02:43:04.307 --> 02:43:05.642
IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WAY

02:43:05.709 --> 02:43:07.811
CAN JUST. A SYSTEMS SELECT

02:43:07.878 --> 02:43:10.747
SYSTEM AND TO TRY. A ITS MOST

02:43:10.814 --> 02:43:13.016
EFFICIENT. THE TO DO THAT BUT

02:43:13.083 --> 02:43:15.619
TOGETHER IN PUT DOWN TRACK OF

02:43:15.685 --> 02:43:18.455
THE COME BACK LATER. THE END UP

02:43:18.522 --> 02:43:19.656
KNOW DIG UNDER THE THAT TRACK

02:43:19.723 --> 02:43:22.792
TO DO. JUST ELECTRIFICATION. SO

02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:23.293
THAT THAT IS HOW WE HAVE

02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:24.594
PROPOSED BUT I THINK THE

02:43:24.661 --> 02:43:26.997
SEPARATE ANTI. GIVE AS A OF THE

02:43:27.063 --> 02:43:30.267
PART. OF THE OF NOT GOING TO

02:43:30.333 --> 02:43:31.701
TOO FAST. SO YOU. THAT YOU THAT

02:43:31.768 --> 02:43:33.904
THE AND YOU. IS A GOOD

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:36.940

INTEND TO REVIEW THEM AND- AND

02:43:42.812 --> 02:43:44.147
DISCUSS THEM EITHER WITH THE

02:43:44.214 --> 02:43:50.921

THAT SO THERE ARE. A REST THE

02:43:58.895 --> 02:44:00.997
WE HAVE TO. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE

02:44:01.064 --> 02:44:02.899
BE MY OF THE AND IT WORKED

02:44:02.966 --> 02:44:06.503
THROUGH SO FUN AND OTHER. SO

CERTAINLY THE TIMES AND ALL

02:44:18.515 --> 02:44:20.116
THAT'S GOING ON THE COLD

02:44:20.183 --> 02:44:22.252
NINETEEN WHICH MEMBERS HAVE. A

02:44:22.319 --> 02:44:23.820
REFERENCE REQUIRE US TO BE

02:44:23.887 --> 02:44:24.988

THE BUSINESS PLAN LAID OUT.

02:44:43.106 --> 02:44:43.907
WHAT WE THOUGHT THE BEST PATH

02:44:43.974 --> 02:44:45.709
FORWARD WAS ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH

02:44:45.775 --> 02:44:47.978
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT IN FRONT

02:44:48.044 --> 02:44:48.545
OF THE WORLD CHANGING

02:44:48.612 --> 02:44:51.014
DRAMATICALLY. ADOPTED HAS-

02:44:51.081 --> 02:44:52.749
WHILE WE- STILL THINK THAT THIS

02:44:52.816 --> 02:44:54.751
IS THE- BEST APPROACH GOING

02:44:54.818 --> 02:44:55.719
FORWARD WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE

02:44:55.785 --> 02:44:57.220
TIME. TO DO A DEEPER DIVE AND

02:44:57.287 --> 02:45:00.757
MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE DOING

THAT. THIS PROJECT CONTINUES.

02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:15.672
OF TO BE MUCH MORE- THAN WE

02:45:15.739 --> 02:45:18.675

02:45:18.742 --> 02:45:21.111
THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS YOU KNOW

02:45:21.177 --> 02:45:22.679

ADDITIVES- THAT YOU MAY BE

THE RISKS ARE BEING TAKEN INTO

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:42.766
CONSIDERATION. AND THAT WE DO

02:45:42.832 --> 02:45:45.168

02:48:11.448 --> 02:48:12.615
EMERGING TRANSPORTATION

02:48:12.682 --> 02:48:14.284
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NOW IN

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:15.919
DEVELOPMENT AND THERE ON THE

02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:18.922
HORIZON. IF CALIFORNIA WAS

02:48:18.988 --> 02:48:20.857
STARTING FROM SCRATCH TODAY

02:48:20.924 --> 02:48:21.391
LET'S SAY WE ARE ONLY NOW

02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:24.194
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO BUILD A

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:27.096
HIGH SPEED TRAIN SERVICE FROM

02:48:27.163 --> 02:48:27.530
NORTHERN TO SOUTHERN

02:48:27.597 --> 02:48:31.167
CALIFORNIA. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

02:48:31.234 --> 02:48:32.402
UNDERTAKING THAT PROJECT. I

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:34.871
ABSOLUTELY WOULD AND THE REASON

02:48:34.938 --> 02:48:39.008
I WOULD IS. I'VE BEEN PLAYING

02:48:39.075 --> 02:48:41.377
IN TRANSPORTATION POLICY FOR

02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:43.313
TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA

02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:44.447
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE

02:48:44.514 --> 02:48:46.850
PROJECT THAT OFFERS AS MUCH AS

02:48:46.916 --> 02:48:49.352
THIS ONE DOES- IN FULL BUILD

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:52.689
OUT- IN TERMS OF MOBILITY

02:48:52.755 --> 02:48:54.257
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

02:48:54.324 --> 02:48:56.259
BENEFITS ALL IN ONE PROJECT

02:48:56.326 --> 02:48:58.194
THERE IS NO DOUBT. THAT THIS

02:48:58.261 --> 02:48:59.596
PROJECT IS EXPENSIVE AND WILL

02:48:59.662 --> 02:49:01.531
TAKE A LONG TIME AND THAT WAS

02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:03.299
TRUE THE DAY WAS ON THE BALLOT

02:49:03.366 --> 02:49:05.235
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE

02:49:05.301 --> 02:49:07.103
VOTERS PROVIDED NINE BILLION

02:49:07.170 --> 02:49:08.972
FOR A PROJECT ESTIMATED TO COST

02:49:09.038 --> 02:49:10.907
FORTY FIVE BILLION. 20% OF WHAT

02:49:10.974 --> 02:49:12.876
WE NEED SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE

02:49:12.942 --> 02:49:14.444
WATER OUT IN REGARD FEDERAL

02:49:14.511 --> 02:49:16.145
FUNDS AND WE'VE GOT ADDITIONAL

02:49:16.212 --> 02:49:17.680
STATE FUNDS THROUGH CAP AND

02:49:17.747 --> 02:49:20.917
TRADE- BUT I CAN'T YOU CANNOT

02:49:20.984 --> 02:49:22.752
BUILD ANOTHER FREEWAYS IN

02:49:22.819 --> 02:49:25.488
CALIFORNIA OR EXPAND ENOUGH

02:49:25.555 --> 02:49:26.923
AIRPORTS IN CALIFORNIA. TO

02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:28.691
REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES LIKE THIS

02:49:28.758 --> 02:49:31.227
PROJECT CAN DO OF THE IDEA THAT

02:49:31.294 --> 02:49:33.496
WE CAN MOVE UP FROM SAN

02:49:33.563 --> 02:49:35.632
FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES OR AND

02:49:35.698 --> 02:49:38.201
I IN ABOUT THREE HOURS AS

02:49:38.268 --> 02:49:40.103
OPPOSED TO DRIVING IT AND SEVEN

02:49:40.169 --> 02:49:41.604
OR EIGHT. OR AS OPPOSED TO

TAKING TRADITIONAL A RAIL THAT

02:49:43.907 --> 02:49:46.609
TAKES THIRTEEN HOURS- THAT'S

02:49:46.676 --> 02:49:48.678
WHY I WANTED TO THE PROJECT AND

02:49:48.745 --> 02:49:50.947
THE ICING ON THE CAKE FOR ME ON

02:49:51.014 --> 02:49:55.818
THIS IS THE ECONOMIC. OF THE IT

02:49:55.885 --> 02:49:58.321
WENT SO PEOPLE TO. THOU FIFTY

02:49:58.388 --> 02:50:01.791
THAT. RATED TODAY. OVER TWO

02:50:01.858 --> 02:50:03.593
HUNDRED THAT IF WE DO MERCED TO

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.229
BAKERSFIELD PEAS OF HYPE JOB

02:50:06.296 --> 02:50:09.065
IT'S A VAMP. OF ANY BY BENEFITS

02:50:09.132 --> 02:50:10.133
ARE TERRIFIC IS NOT ON IS THIS

02:50:10.199 --> 02:50:11.601
A LOT. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO

02:50:11.668 --> 02:50:14.203
USING RENEWABLE SOURCE OF POWER

02:50:14.270 --> 02:50:16.539
SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I

02:50:16.606 --> 02:50:19.876
AM A SUPPORTER AND I WOULD I

02:50:19.943 --> 02:50:21.778
WOULD ADVOCATE TO POLICY MAKERS

02:50:21.844 --> 02:50:24.514
TO CONTINUE. TO TRY TO BUILD AN

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.149
INTERCITY INTER REGIONAL

02:50:26.215 --> 02:50:27.750
ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL

02:50:27.817 --> 02:50:30.620
SYSTEM TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS A

02:50:30.687 --> 02:50:32.388
BETTER OPTIONS TO TRAVEL AROUND

02:50:32.455 --> 02:50:34.023
THE STATE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT

02:50:34.090 --> 02:50:35.925
SO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:37.427
TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AYE HYPERLOOP

02:50:37.493 --> 02:50:39.262
TO TAKE ONE EXIT ROAD SYSTEM

02:50:39.329 --> 02:50:40.930
THANK WILL A COMP THE

02:50:40.997 --> 02:50:41.831
OBJECTIVES ARE MUCH. THAN

02:50:41.898 --> 02:50:44.300
HIGHEST RAIL THAT WOULD CHANGE

02:50:44.367 --> 02:50:47.804
OUTLOOK WHAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF

02:50:47.870 --> 02:50:49.772
THE DEVELOPER OF HYPER BUT YOU

02:50:49.839 --> 02:50:50.640
TALK ABOUT. I THERE'S A

02:50:50.707 --> 02:50:53.610
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A PROVEN

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:56.412
TECHNOLOGY AND THIS IS PROVEN I

02:50:56.479 --> 02:50:58.881
MEAN THIS IS OPERATING IN EVERY

02:50:58.948 --> 02:51:02.051
MAJOR OF ECONOMIC- POWER IN THE

02:51:02.118 --> 02:51:04.787
WORLD EXCEPT HERE OF YOU KNOW

02:51:04.854 --> 02:51:07.223
HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED RAIL-

02:51:07.290 --> 02:51:09.726
AND SO- THIS IS A PROVEN

02:51:09.792 --> 02:51:11.661
TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS IMMENSE

02:51:11.728 --> 02:51:13.262
BENEFITS FOR THE STATE AND THE

02:51:13.329 --> 02:51:15.198
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT- AND SO

THAT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP. MY

02:51:18.201 --> 02:51:19.802
PERSONAL VIEW ON IT RIGHT NOW

02:51:19.869 --> 02:51:21.604
IT'S JUST MY PERSONAL VIEW IS

02:51:21.671 --> 02:51:23.473
THAT I THINK ITS APPLICATION IS

02:51:23.539 --> 02:51:25.174
PROBABLY BETTER FOR GOODS

02:51:25.241 --> 02:51:26.509
MOVEMENT THAT PEOPLE MOVEMENT

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:29.012
AT LEAST AT THIS POINT- UNTIL

02:51:29.078 --> 02:51:31.347
WE SEE MORE OF- EXACTLY HOW

02:51:31.414 --> 02:51:33.016
THAT WILL WORK BUT THAT'S

02:51:33.082 --> 02:51:35.051

ACTION ON TECHNOLOGY I KNOW

02:51:37.687 --> 02:51:39.489
OTHERS HAVE SAID THINGS OF LIKE

02:51:39.555 --> 02:51:41.724

VEHICLES BUT THOSE VEHICLES OP

02:51:48.731 --> 02:51:50.667
ON HIGHWAYS THEY'RE NOT GOING

02:51:50.733 --> 02:51:52.602

SCHEDULE APPEAR TO BE AN- AND

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:52.855
AMBITIOUS BOTH IN THE NEW TERM

02:53:52.922 --> 02:53:58.127
AND THE LONG TERM. YOUR TURN.

02:53:58.194 --> 02:53:58.995
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT

02:53:59.061 --> 02:54:11.707
AND JUST CON I AND WE DO. YOUR

02:54:11.774 --> 02:54:12.942
CITY PATENT AROUND BY TWENTY

02:54:13.009 --> 02:54:14.544
TWENTY YOU ON AND THEY NEED TO

02:54:14.610 --> 02:54:15.444
TAKE THAT APPROACH BECAUSE

02:54:15.511 --> 02:54:17.480
THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS THAT ARE

02:54:17.547 --> 02:54:19.315
WHICH MEANS THAT THE FULL-

02:54:19.382 --> 02:54:20.917
ACQUISITION ALL THE CARD READER

02:54:20.983 --> 02:54:21.484
NEEDED PRETTY INITIAL

02:54:21.551 --> 02:54:22.585
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT ABOUT THE

02:54:22.652 --> 02:54:24.387
CIVIL WAR BE COMPLETED BEFORE

02:54:24.453 --> 02:54:25.288
THE ATTACK AND DEFEND

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:27.590
CONTRACTOR NEED TO BEGIN WORK I

02:54:27.657 --> 02:54:28.391
TO WHAT THIS APPROACH IS

02:54:28.457 --> 02:54:29.759
EXPECTED TO EXPEDITE THE

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:31.327
COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT IT

02:54:31.394 --> 02:54:33.062
WILL AND IT'S EXPECTED TO ADD

02:54:33.129 --> 02:54:36.432
SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY. AND

02:54:36.499 --> 02:54:37.500
RAISE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:54:37.567 --> 02:54:39.468
CONTRACT. WE WOULD KNOW THAT

02:54:39.535 --> 02:54:41.504
EVEN WITH MORE COMPLEX APPROACH

02:54:41.571 --> 02:54:42.972
ARE THERE ISN'T MUCH WIGGLE

02:54:43.039 --> 02:54:44.874
ROOM IN THE IN THE SCHEDULE FOR

02:54:44.941 --> 02:54:47.376
THE PROJECT- FEDERAL GRANT

02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:49.078
DEADLINE. SO CURRENTLY THE

02:54:49.145 --> 02:54:50.847
AUTHORITY ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:52.281
TO MEET THE FEDERAL GRANT

02:54:52.348 --> 02:54:54.217
DEADLINE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO-

02:54:54.283 --> 02:54:56.619
HOWEVER- IT WOULD REALLY

02:54:56.686 --> 02:54:59.255
REQUIRE QUITE AN INCREASE IN

02:54:59.322 --> 02:55:02.592
EXPENDITURE RATE SO WE ALREADY-HEARD FROM AND MISTER KELLY

02:55:02.658 --> 02:55:03.860
THAT. THE AUTHORITY HAD

02:55:03.926 --> 02:55:05.595
INCREASED IT EXPENDITURE RATE

02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:06.629
AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO

02:55:06.696 --> 02:55:07.864
SO QUITE A BIT MORE THAN EVEN

02:55:07.930 --> 02:55:10.800
THEY'VE DONE THAT FAR IN ORDER

02:55:10.867 --> 02:55:11.467
TO MEET THAT. I DON'T GRAY THAT

02:55:11.534 --> 02:55:12.702
MIGHT. I'M ALSO IN THE LONG

02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:16.239
TERM. THE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS.

02:55:16.305 --> 02:55:17.273
PROVIDE ABOUT AND FEES ONE OF

02:55:17.340 --> 02:55:20.376
APPEARED. SO THAT THAT DEADLINE

02:55:20.443 --> 02:55:22.745
OR THE DATE THE IN THE- IN THE

02:55:22.812 --> 02:55:24.113
BUSINESS PLAN THE DRAFT THE

02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:25.948
PLAN A DIFFICULT FINDING AND AS

02:55:26.015 --> 02:55:27.216
WE'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT IN THIS

02:55:27.283 --> 02:55:28.217
HEARING I'M CURRENTLY THERE

02:55:28.284 --> 02:55:29.352
ISN'T FULL FUNDING FOR THE

02:55:29.418 --> 02:55:30.753
PROJECT. AND THERE'S PROBABLY

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:32.555
THAT'S ABOUT IT AND THAT CAN

02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:36.025
CHILI- CINCO WHILE COMPLETE

02:55:36.092 --> 02:55:39.996
MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD BUT NOT.

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:40.596
BEING PART OF THE PROJECT. SO

02:55:40.663 --> 02:55:42.198
THAT REALLY THE COMPLETE DATE

02:55:42.265 --> 02:55:43.532
FOR THE- FULL VALUE VALLEY IN

02:55:43.599 --> 02:55:44.834
PHASE ONE IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS

02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:46.936
TIME. FOR THE SECOND KEY

02:55:47.003 --> 02:55:48.771
OVERSIGHT ISSUE THAT WE WANTED

02:55:48.838 --> 02:55:50.873
TO RAISE IS THAT FUNDING MAY

02:55:50.940 --> 02:55:52.375
NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR THE PROJECT

02:55:52.441 --> 02:55:53.409
AND AGAIN THERE ARE CERTAIN

02:55:53.476 --> 02:55:54.443
YOUR TERM AS WELL AS LONGER

02:55:54.510 --> 02:55:56.545
TERM CHALLENGES. THE PROJECT IN

02:55:56.612 --> 02:55:58.848
THE AREA FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:55:58.915 --> 02:55:59.415
THESE ALSO COME WITH THEIR

02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:02.084
COLLEAGUES. AND SO IN TERMS OF

02:56:02.151 --> 02:56:03.319
THE NEW TRIMS CHALLENGES THE

02:56:03.386 --> 02:56:04.987
ACTUAL COST OF AMBER

02:56:05.054 --> 02:56:07.590
TECHNICALLY SKILLED SEGMENT

02:56:07.657 --> 02:56:08.190
COULD BE HIGHER THAN IN. THE

02:56:08.257 --> 02:56:10.126
PROJECT HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED

02:56:10.192 --> 02:56:12.695
SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES- AND

02:56:12.762 --> 02:56:14.196
GIVEN TO THE PATH. THE PATH TO

02:56:14.263 --> 02:56:15.865
THE COST INCREASES AS WELL AS

02:56:15.932 --> 02:56:17.767
JUST THE- NATURE OF THESE LARGE

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:20.236
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

02:56:20.303 --> 02:56:21.938
ESPECIALLY. BAKER SAID THAT MAY

02:56:22.004 --> 02:56:23.606
INCLUDE SIX EXTENSION MERCED

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:25.341
BAKERSFIELD AND THOSE- ARE

02:56:25.408 --> 02:56:26.876
REALLY AT THE EARLY STAGES AND

02:56:26.943 --> 02:56:29.679
AS WE HEARD. OF ANY PROJECT AND

02:56:29.745 --> 02:56:30.246
THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:33.883
THERE THAT YOU MORE UNCERTAINTY

02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:34.817
IN TERMS OF THAT COST. AND WE

02:56:34.884 --> 02:56:36.185
ALSO THAT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE

02:56:36.252 --> 02:56:37.820
FINDINGS THAT ANTICIPATED

02:56:37.887 --> 02:56:40.089
WAFFLING MATERIALIZE- SO

02:56:40.156 --> 02:56:42.291
ESSENTIALLY THE- BAKERSFIELD

02:56:42.358 --> 02:56:43.526
SEGMENT WELL I'VE DONE SOME

02:56:43.592 --> 02:56:45.161
FUNDING SOURCES THAT YOU HAVE

02:56:45.227 --> 02:56:46.796
MEANT CERTAIN KEY ONE OF THEM

02:56:46.862 --> 02:56:47.997
WE HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IS

02:56:48.064 --> 02:56:49.532
THE FEDERAL GRANT. THE POINT

02:56:49.598 --> 02:56:51.200
FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANT

02:56:51.267 --> 02:56:52.935
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS.

02:56:53.002 --> 02:56:54.270
THREATENED TO EXPAND BE USED

02:56:54.337 --> 02:56:56.572
AND SO- THAT'S CERTAINLY A

02:56:56.639 --> 02:56:58.507
WRECK FAIR. ADDITIONALLY THE

02:56:58.574 --> 02:56:59.976
PLAN RELIES ON ESTIMATES THE

02:57:00.042 --> 02:57:01.677
FUTURE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE.

02:57:01.744 --> 02:57:03.479
AND THERE'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE

02:57:03.546 --> 02:57:04.680
HERE AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE

02:57:04.747 --> 02:57:06.749
UNCERTAINTY GIVING HER THE

02:57:06.816 --> 02:57:07.750
NINETEEN AND- UNDER AND

02:57:07.817 --> 02:57:09.418
CONCERNS THAT WHETHER YOU MIGHT

02:57:09.485 --> 02:57:11.253
UP WITHIN A SHORT TERM. BOB

02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:13.923
COOK HAPPENS RIGHT SO BOTH FIND

02:57:13.990 --> 02:57:14.924
OUT WHAT THE NAY RESULTS ARE

02:57:14.991 --> 02:57:21.530
VERY SOON BACK. ON THAT THE

02:57:21.597 --> 02:57:23.466
CONFLICT. WELL COULD MAKE OF

02:57:23.532 --> 02:57:24.934
THE STATE AFTER TO THE FEDERAL

02:57:25.001 --> 02:57:27.036
FINE OR AND KEPT TRADE REVENUE

02:57:27.103 --> 02:57:28.170
TO MATERIAL OR CAR CARD ARE

02:57:28.237 --> 02:57:30.072
HIGHER THE THEY THERE NEEDS TO

02:57:30.139 --> 02:57:31.240
BE FUNDING SOURCES PERHAPS THE

02:57:31.307 --> 02:57:34.677
GENERAL. THAT THAT THAT IS

02:57:34.744 --> 02:57:37.380
COMPLETELY GROSSED OUT I'M WE

02:57:37.446 --> 02:57:38.848
DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THAT

02:57:38.914 --> 02:57:40.316
TIGHTENING OF THE FUNDING IT

02:57:40.383 --> 02:57:41.884
MIGHT NOT A LINE WITH PROJECT

02:57:41.951 --> 02:57:44.220
PLEASE- THAT WE'VE HEARD A

02:57:44.286 --> 02:57:45.955
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KPMG TUDY

02:57:46.022 --> 02:57:47.757
I'M NOT STUDY IDENTIFIED THAT

02:57:47.823 --> 02:57:49.325
EVEN IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

02:57:49.392 --> 02:57:51.460
TIME IS THERE FOR THE PROJECT

02:57:51.527 --> 02:57:52.795
FROM THE BAKERSFIELD EVEN IF

02:57:52.862 --> 02:57:54.196
THE STATE HAS SUFFICIENT

02:57:54.263 --> 02:57:55.865
CARPENTRY REVENUE IN WHICH CAME

02:57:55.931 --> 02:57:58.534
AROUND. BUT HE MAY NOT A LINE

02:57:58.601 --> 02:57:59.969
AND PARTICULARLY IF AND

02:58:00.036 --> 02:58:01.670
CABINETRY REVENUES ON THE LOWER

02:58:01.737 --> 02:58:04.040
END FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE

02:58:04.106 --> 02:58:11.614
SOME. CASH CERTAIN YEARS. WHAT

02:58:11.680 --> 02:58:12.381
WE UNDERSTAND THE VEHICLE AND

02:58:12.448 --> 02:58:14.884
WITH MY HOW TO ADDRESS THANK

02:58:14.950 --> 02:58:16.018
IT'S SOMETHING THAT AT NEAR

02:58:16.085 --> 02:58:17.486
WITHOUT AND IT COULD BE MORE

02:58:17.553 --> 02:58:18.954
CAL TO PROVIDE AND BY NAME THE

02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:21.157
PROJECT IF IT ANYTHING THAT'S

02:58:21.223 --> 02:58:24.560
NOT A GOOD THE- I KNOW COURSE

02:58:24.627 --> 02:58:25.194
I'M NOT. INTO ALONG TERM VALUE

02:58:25.261 --> 02:58:27.663
CHALLENGE. AND I THINK ENOUGH

02:58:27.730 --> 02:58:28.497
FOR THE REST OF THE CROWD. ARE

02:58:28.564 --> 02:58:29.365
THERE CERTAIN UNCERTAIN HE

02:58:29.432 --> 02:58:31.534
ABOUT. THE LEVEL OF KERR FOR

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:32.835
THE PROJECT- BOTH BECAUSE IT'S

02:58:32.902 --> 02:58:34.737
JUST A LARGE SCALE. CAPITAL

02:58:34.804 --> 02:58:36.205
PROJECT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD AND

02:58:36.272 --> 02:58:37.306
CERTAINTY AND MANY OF THE

02:58:37.373 --> 02:58:39.275
QUESTIONS AND THE VERY EARLY

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:40.876
STAGES WHILE SO THERE'S- A

02:58:40.943 --> 02:58:42.044
HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY

02:58:42.111 --> 02:58:44.413
THERE- AND THEN ALSO AS- HAS

02:58:44.480 --> 02:58:46.148
BEEN NOTED. THERE'S NO FUNDING

02:58:46.215 --> 02:58:48.784
PLAN YET COMMERCE SAID DEBATERS

02:58:48.851 --> 02:58:50.052
BEFORE BEYOND RESPECTIVELY. BUT

02:58:50.119 --> 02:58:51.554
THE POINT. I THANK CLEAR HOW

02:58:51.620 --> 02:58:56.192
THAT ADDITIONAL. FUNDING WOULD

02:58:56.258 --> 02:58:57.760
BE WOULD BE NOT. YES THAT WE

02:58:57.827 --> 02:58:59.462
WANTED TO BRING A- IT THAT AN

02:58:59.528 --> 02:59:01.130
OPERATING SAID TO IS EXPECTED

02:59:01.197 --> 02:59:02.832
TO BE REQUIRED AGAIN I KNOW

02:59:02.898 --> 02:59:04.300
THAT COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT

02:59:04.366 --> 02:59:06.735
THAT- SOME EXTENT I DON'T WANT

02:59:06.802 --> 02:59:07.870
TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT

02:59:07.937 --> 02:59:09.038
EVENTUALLY THE AUTHORITY

02:59:09.105 --> 02:59:10.706
GRANTED TO USE THE THIRD PARTY

02:59:10.773 --> 02:59:12.775
PUBLIC ENTITY TO OPERATE THIS

02:59:12.842 --> 02:59:14.343
INTERIM SERVICE THE PEOPLE TAKE

02:59:14.410 --> 02:59:15.611
COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE

02:59:15.678 --> 02:59:18.848
A- AND THE MEASURE DOES HAVE

02:59:18.914 --> 02:59:20.049
SOME LANGUAGE THERE THAT WAS

02:59:20.116 --> 02:59:26.122
REFERENCE- AND- THAT. AT THAT.

02:59:26.188 --> 02:59:28.424
GLORY FROM FRIEND REQUIRING

02:59:28.491 --> 02:59:30.493
OPERATING. AT TO THIS APPROACH

02:59:30.559 --> 02:59:32.628
WOULD BASICALLY SAID THAT THE

02:59:32.695 --> 02:59:34.864
TAXPAYERS WOULD STILL END UP

02:59:34.930 --> 02:59:35.998
POTENTIALLY SUBSIDIZING

02:59:36.065 --> 02:59:38.033
OPERATION- BUT IT WOULD BE

02:59:38.100 --> 02:59:40.469
THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY- AND SO

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:41.403
THAT DOESN'T REALLY NECESSARILY

02:59:41.470 --> 02:59:42.872
CHANGE THE PRACTICAL THE FACT

02:59:42.938 --> 02:59:44.273
THAT THE STATE WOULD BEAR

02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:45.674
INTERSTATE TAXPAYERS WOULD BEAR

02:59:45.741 --> 02:59:46.709
A PORTION OF THE DISTANT

02:59:46.775 --> 02:59:48.477
OPERATING COSTS AT LEAST DURING

02:59:48.544 --> 02:59:50.012
THAT NONE OF THAT. LAND SO

02:59:50.079 --> 02:59:53.749
PROVINCIALLY. A CONCERN IN

02:59:53.816 --> 02:59:54.283
TERMS OF THE SPIRIT OF THE

02:59:54.350 --> 02:59:55.017
MEASURE. AND THEN- THE FOURTH

02:59:55.084 --> 02:59:57.286
ISSUE I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. IS

02:59:57.353 --> 02:59:58.554
REALLY THAT THAT THE FACT THAT

02:59:58.621 --> 02:59:59.855
THIS INTERIM SERVICE DEPENDS ON

02:59:59.922 --> 03:00:01.824
A VARIETY OF FACTORS. I KNOW

03:00:01.891 --> 03:00:03.058
THERE ARE ALSO REFERENCES TO

03:00:03.125 --> 03:00:07.363
RIDERSHIP AND- HOW DID OPTION

03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:09.031
COMPARED WITH THE DORY THING

03:00:09.098 --> 03:00:10.599
FOR COMPARATIVE MOTHER OPTION.

03:00:10.666 --> 03:00:13.369
I'M REALLY BEEN ALICE'S THAT

03:00:13.435 --> 03:00:14.136
WAS DONE BY THAT REALLY TRAIN

03:00:14.203 --> 03:00:16.372
OPERATOR AND- IT REALLY DEPENDS

03:00:16.438 --> 03:00:18.541
ON. A VARIETY OF THE TIMES.

03:00:18.607 --> 03:00:19.909
THAT THEY MAKE IN TERMS OF

03:00:19.975 --> 03:00:21.243
DURING THE MODELING I JUST

03:00:21.310 --> 03:00:22.111
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF

03:00:22.178 --> 03:00:23.712
THEM. THAT ARE PARTICULARLY

03:00:23.779 --> 03:00:25.981
NOTABLE. ONE IS THAT THE

03:00:26.048 --> 03:00:28.017
ANALYSIS ASSUMES THE COMPLETION

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:30.286
OF OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS AND

03:00:30.352 --> 03:00:31.086
ONE OF THE MAIN ONES THAT THE

03:00:31.153 --> 03:00:34.757
FILM IS THE COMPLETION. OF AT

03:00:34.823 --> 03:00:36.458
STATION AT AT MERCED THAT WOULD

03:00:36.525 --> 03:00:40.963
SERVE. AS YOU. LOOK AT. THE

03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:43.165
SAME ONCE. AS WELL AS A OPPOSED

03:00:43.232 --> 03:00:44.266
HIGH RAIL AUTHORITY. SO

03:00:44.333 --> 03:00:46.335
CURRENTLY. I'M WORKING IN THE-

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:48.470
THEY HAVE A SEPARATE. OCCASIONS

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:49.405
THAT'S ABOUT OVER MILE AWAY

03:00:49.471 --> 03:00:51.607
FROM THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL.

03:00:51.674 --> 03:00:54.376
PLANTATION AND TO THAT WOULD

03:00:54.443 --> 03:00:55.110
HAVE TO BE INTEGRATED. SO THE

03:00:55.177 --> 03:00:56.579
ESTIMATE THAT PROJECT WOULD BE

03:00:56.645 --> 03:00:58.514
COMPLETED AND FIND AT. THEY

03:00:58.581 --> 03:01:00.516
ALSO- ALSO HE ANNOUNCES THAT

03:01:00.583 --> 03:01:02.785
SEEMS PERFECT RELIABILITY AND

03:01:02.851 --> 03:01:03.719
THAT'S NOT JUST THE HIGH SPEED

03:01:03.786 --> 03:01:05.287
RAIL SERVICE. BUT ALSO

03:01:05.354 --> 03:01:06.455
CONNECTING TRAIN AND BUS

03:01:06.522 --> 03:01:07.990
SERVICES AND THAT THEY WOULD

03:01:08.057 --> 03:01:10.626
OPERATE WITH 100% RELIABILITY.

03:01:10.693 --> 03:01:12.428
I'M HOWEVER CURRENTLY THOSE

03:01:12.494 --> 03:01:15.397
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES DON'T-OPERATE AT THAT LEVEL OF

03:01:15.464 --> 03:01:19.335
RELIABILITY AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR

03:01:19.401 --> 03:01:20.536
WHETHER. THAT WOULD MATERIALIZE.

03:01:20.603 --> 03:01:21.971
IF YOU GO BACK TO DOCTOR

03:01:22.037 --> 03:01:24.139
KILLERS POINTS HERE I THINK THE

03:01:24.206 --> 03:01:25.407
REASON WHY THESE ASSUMPTIONS

03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:29.778
ARE SO HE- BECAUSE- AND- THAT

03:01:29.845 --> 03:01:33.148
BASICALLY THAT ANALYSIS ASSUME

03:01:33.215 --> 03:01:35.251
REALLY THAT. EASY WE MUST

03:01:35.317 --> 03:01:37.720
TRANSFER I'M AND NOT I THINK

03:01:37.786 --> 03:01:38.821
ONE OF THE KEY THING THAT

03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:40.789
DRIVING ON THE HIGHER RIDERSHIP

03:01:40.856 --> 03:01:42.925
THAT THEY'RE ASSUMING. I'M

03:01:42.992 --> 03:01:44.126
THIRTY THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:45.427
THAT THE STATION ISN'T WELL

03:01:45.494 --> 03:01:47.663
INTEGRATED OR- WHAT THE

03:01:47.730 --> 03:01:49.365
SERVICES DON'T PERFECTLY

03:01:49.431 --> 03:01:51.066
CONNECTING PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT

03:01:51.133 --> 03:01:53.569
AND YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE IT

03:01:53.636 --> 03:01:54.970
COULD BE A LESS DESIRABLE

03:01:55.037 --> 03:01:56.739
TRANSPORTATION OPTION OF HER

03:01:56.805 --> 03:02:00.409
WRITERS SPEND IT IF YOU CAN.

03:02:00.476 --> 03:02:01.744
ANALYSIS AND THEN AND I

03:02:01.810 --> 03:02:03.212
ASSUMPTION THAT MY WANTED TO

03:02:03.279 --> 03:02:05.047
HIGHLIGHTED BUT IT ALSO YEAH

03:02:05.114 --> 03:02:07.449
THIS ALSO WITH THEM- AS WOULD

03:02:07.516 --> 03:02:09.251
MENTION THAT. BASICALLY THERE'S

03:02:09.318 --> 03:02:12.354
NO COMPETING SERVICE- ALONG

03:02:12.421 --> 03:02:13.722
THAT SEGMENT THAT THAT THAT

03:02:13.789 --> 03:02:15.758
HAVE YOUR LOGO HE WOULD OPERATE

03:02:15.824 --> 03:02:17.326
THERE. AND TO BASICALLY THE

03:02:17.393 --> 03:02:20.362
FAMILY HE WOULDN'T OPERATE

03:02:20.429 --> 03:02:20.929
SOUTH OF MERCED. SO QUICKLY

03:02:20.996 --> 03:02:23.265
TRADE OUT REGARDING THAT. THE

03:02:23.332 --> 03:02:24.967
COUNTY PROVIDE THEM CONTINUE TO

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:27.536
PROVIDE CAN WHAT I'M SERVICE ON

03:02:27.603 --> 03:02:29.038
THAT SEGMENT. AND EXCUSE ME

03:02:29.104 --> 03:02:31.674
THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD

03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:32.241
POTENTIALLY CHANGE RIDERSHIP

03:02:32.308 --> 03:02:33.175
WITH WHAT. SO WE JUST WANTED TO

03:02:33.242 --> 03:02:35.177
NOTE THAT- IF SOME OF THOSE END

03:02:35.244 --> 03:02:36.345
UP BEING OPTIMISTIC OR

03:02:36.412 --> 03:02:38.080
INCORRECT THAT COULD DEFINITELY

03:02:38.147 --> 03:02:38.747
CHANGED THE RIDERSHIP

03:02:38.814 --> 03:02:40.983
ESTIMATES. THAT THE AUTHORITY

03:02:41.050 --> 03:02:43.986
AND THE STORY HAS IN THEIR PLAN

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:45.754
AND THAT COULD CHANGE EVEN THE

03:02:45.821 --> 03:02:48.223
RELATIVE- THE RELATIVE

03:02:48.290 --> 03:02:49.958
RIDERSHIP BY VARIOUS OPTIONS

03:02:50.025 --> 03:02:51.260
SO. I THERE ARE A COUPLE

03:02:51.327 --> 03:02:53.629
OPTIONS THAT WERE LOOKED AT-

03:02:53.696 --> 03:02:55.464
ONE IN THE LA AREA I WON IN THE

03:02:55.531 --> 03:02:57.199
BAY AREA YOUR COMPARED AGAINST

03:02:57.266 --> 03:02:58.767
THE OPTION AND- FOR THAT MUCH

03:02:58.834 --> 03:03:00.769
THAT THE BAKERSFIELD MINE. I AM

03:03:00.836 --> 03:03:02.404
CERTAINLY HOW THOSE DIFFERENT

03:03:02.471 --> 03:03:04.239
ALTERNATIVES COMPARE WAITED

03:03:04.306 --> 03:03:09.678
WOULD BE BASED ON. THE TYPES OF

03:03:09.745 --> 03:03:10.245
ASSUMPTIONS AND WHETHER THAT

03:03:10.312 --> 03:03:10.779
PLAY OUT. ALSO WHEN HE TO

03:03:10.846 --> 03:03:12.281
HIGHLIGHT THE OTHER ALTER EXIST

03:03:12.348 --> 03:03:13.515
IF YOU OF THOSE. LINE IF YOU

03:03:13.582 --> 03:03:14.983
CAN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. YOU

03:03:15.050 --> 03:03:15.951
COULD DO A SHORTER LONGER

03:03:16.018 --> 03:03:17.319
STATEMENT YOU CAN GRIND

03:03:17.386 --> 03:03:18.854
DIFFERENT TAKE THE TRAIN BUT AT

03:03:18.921 --> 03:03:20.122
A NEW. KIND OF PEOPLE TRAINED

03:03:20.189 --> 03:03:22.257
COULD RUN EITHER YOUR MISSION

03:03:22.324 --> 03:03:23.792
TRAIN. I'M CALLING YOU IF

03:03:23.859 --> 03:03:25.627
DIFFERENT SET OF PROJECT AS

03:03:25.694 --> 03:03:27.496
WELL IF YOU READ AT NINETY SO

03:03:27.563 --> 03:03:29.365
THERE ARE. DIFFERENT OPTIONS

03:03:29.431 --> 03:03:31.166
THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED. AND

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:32.401
THEN FINALLY- IN TERMS OF

03:03:32.468 --> 03:03:33.902
ISSUES THAT THIS ISSUE I WANTED

03:03:33.969 --> 03:03:35.838
HER HIGHLIGHT AND THAT WE THAT

03:03:35.904 --> 03:03:37.439
WE HAD IN OUR REPORT IS THAT

03:03:37.506 --> 03:03:39.208
THAT BECAUSE THE COACH PROVIDED

03:03:39.274 --> 03:03:40.943
BY THE AUTHORITY. I DOESN'T

03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:44.046
PROVIDE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY SO

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:44.580
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE

03:03:44.646 --> 03:03:46.048
REALLY KEY POINTS. ON THE

03:03:46.115 --> 03:03:47.549
AUTHORITY PLANS TO TAKE ACTION

03:03:47.616 --> 03:03:50.953
IN TWENTY TWENTY- ON SOME MAJOR

03:03:51.019 --> 03:03:52.855
THINGS THAT WELL KIND OF STAND

03:03:52.921 --> 03:03:55.023
HAPPENED THAT THE STATE DOWN IN

03:03:55.090 --> 03:03:56.191
THE PATH OF DOING WORK THAT THE

03:03:56.258 --> 03:03:59.928
BAKERSFIELD. AND DOING IT ANON

03:03:59.995 --> 03:04:00.929
ELECTRIFIED WAY. AND THE KEY

03:04:00.996 --> 03:04:02.664
ACTIONS INCLUDE ENTERING INTO

03:04:02.731 --> 03:04:04.867
THE TRACKING SYSTEM CONTRACT-

03:04:04.933 --> 03:04:06.268
AND EVEN THAT FIRST INITIAL

03:04:06.335 --> 03:04:07.870
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT INCLUDE

03:04:07.936 --> 03:04:09.605
THE ELECTRIFICATION COMMITMENT.

03:04:09.671 --> 03:04:11.306
ALL OF THAT THE ONE PIECE. OF

03:04:11.373 --> 03:04:13.308
ONCE THAT CONTRACT IS ENTERED

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:14.910
INTO THAT IT GETS HARDER TO

03:04:14.977 --> 03:04:17.846
AND- THE LAYOUT YOUR VACATION

03:04:17.913 --> 03:04:18.480
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANTED TO DO

03:04:18.547 --> 03:04:20.482
THAT. AND ALSO THE AUTHORITY

03:04:20.549 --> 03:04:22.618
PLANNED- IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU

03:04:22.684 --> 03:04:25.354
PROCURE ELECTRIC TRAIN TO AGAIN

03:04:25.421 --> 03:04:26.555
THAT WOULD START TO COMMIT THE

03:04:26.622 --> 03:04:27.956
STATE IN THE NEAR TERM TO

03:04:28.023 --> 03:04:29.792
RUNNING LIKE TO HIDE SERVICE.

03:04:29.858 --> 03:04:32.194
AND ALSO TO- ACQUIRE RIGHT AWAY

03:04:32.261 --> 03:04:33.162
OUTSIDE OF THE INITIAL

03:04:33.228 --> 03:04:34.763
CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT SELECT THE

03:04:34.830 --> 03:04:36.832
HERD. CURRENTLY THE AUTHORITY

03:04:36.899 --> 03:04:38.534
IS JUST ACQUIRING PROPERTIES

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:39.601
WITHIN THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

03:04:39.668 --> 03:04:42.571
SEGMENT. BUT THEY WOULD PLAN TO

03:04:42.638 --> 03:04:43.605
START DOING THAT AFTER THEY

03:04:43.672 --> 03:04:46.408
START MOVING BEYOND THAT- ALL

03:04:46.475 --> 03:04:47.743
THE WAY UP TO MERCED AND IN

03:04:47.810 --> 03:04:49.445
DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD AND EVEN

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:50.846
POTENTIALLY MOTHER AREA AS

03:04:50.913 --> 03:04:53.048
WELL- ONCE THEY HAVE THE

03:04:53.115 --> 03:04:54.983
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE. ACTIVE

03:04:55.050 --> 03:04:57.619
SO IN THE COMING MONTHS. THE

03:04:57.686 --> 03:04:58.587
ONE THOSE PROPERTY ACQUISITION

03:04:58.654 --> 03:05:01.290
START- IT MAKES IT MORE

03:05:01.356 --> 03:05:01.857
DIFFICULT TO CHANGE COURSE

03:05:01.924 --> 03:05:04.426
BECAUSE- WHILE THE STATE COULD.

03:05:04.493 --> 03:05:05.828
GET RID OF THOSE PROPERTIES

03:05:05.894 --> 03:05:07.062
THEIR COSTS THERE AND ALSO WITH

03:05:07.129 --> 03:05:10.532
THEM DIFFICULT. FOR THE

03:05:10.599 --> 03:05:12.100
PROPERTY OWNERS BOB. SO WE

03:05:12.167 --> 03:05:12.668
WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE

03:05:12.734 --> 03:05:14.136
THAT IF A REALLY HE TIME THE

03:05:14.203 --> 03:05:15.237
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS TO

03:05:15.304 --> 03:05:17.473
MAKE A DECISION. ON THE PATH OF

03:05:17.539 --> 03:05:20.008
THE PROJECT BECAUSE- NEXT YEAR

03:05:20.075 --> 03:05:21.376
THERE MAY BE FEWER VIABLE

03:05:21.443 --> 03:05:23.278
OPTION DO THE OPTION MIGHT BE

03:05:23.345 --> 03:05:25.080
MORE LIMITED IN A LOT OF WAYS.

03:05:25.147 --> 03:05:26.815
I'M SO COURSE THAT LEGISLATURE

03:05:26.882 --> 03:05:27.649
COULD CONTINUE WITH THE

03:05:27.716 --> 03:05:29.184
APPROACH IDENTIFIED BY THE

03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:31.420
AUTHORITY. ON THE LEGISLATURE

03:05:31.487 --> 03:05:33.055
COULD SELECT A DIFFERENT

03:05:33.121 --> 03:05:34.189
APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD

03:05:34.256 --> 03:05:36.692
JUST. TRY TO OKAY FINE THAT

03:05:36.758 --> 03:05:40.095
FEDERAL GRANT- AGREEMENTS. ARE

03:05:40.162 --> 03:05:41.530
REQUIREMENTS WHICH WAS REALLY

03:05:41.597 --> 03:05:44.566
JUST KIND OF BASIC TRACK IN

03:05:44.633 --> 03:05:45.100
THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION

03:05:45.167 --> 03:05:46.535
SEGMENT. I'M WORKING MOTHER

03:05:46.602 --> 03:05:48.604
APPROACH IF THE LEGISLATURE IS

03:05:48.670 --> 03:05:49.538
REALLY COMFORTABLE MAKING THAT

03:05:49.605 --> 03:05:51.206
DECISION. IF NOT THE

03:05:51.273 --> 03:05:53.742
LEGISLATURE COULD CERTAINLY-

03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:54.877
DIRECTLY ACCORDING TO TAKE

03:05:54.943 --> 03:05:56.645
ACTION TO HELP PRESERVE SOME

03:05:56.712 --> 03:05:58.180
FLEXIBILITY THE DECISION COULD

03:05:58.247 --> 03:06:00.048
BE MADE AT A LATER DATE. THAT

03:06:00.115 --> 03:06:02.017
COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE-

03:06:02.084 --> 03:06:03.485
MODIFYING THE TRACK AND DEFENSE

03:06:03.552 --> 03:06:05.454
CONTRACT SO THAT OF COURSE

03:06:05.521 --> 03:06:06.655
NOTED TO PROCEED ONLY REALLY

03:06:06.722 --> 03:06:09.858

03:15:37.859 --> 03:15:39.461
WE'VE BEEN UP THERE IN SOME

03:15:39.527 --> 03:15:40.628
WAYS WE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY

03:15:40.695 --> 03:15:42.397
BLESSED MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE

03:15:42.464 --> 03:15:44.065
FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE

03:15:44.132 --> 03:15:47.836
CONSTRUCTION SITE. IT'S BEEN

03:15:47.902 --> 03:15:50.138
VERY LITTLE- IMPACT- WE'VE GOT

03:15:50.205 --> 03:15:52.140
A COUPLE OF POSITIVE- CASES

03:15:52.207 --> 03:15:53.575
WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE-

03:15:53.641 --> 03:15:55.577
APPROPRIATE- ACTIONS THE

03:15:55.643 --> 03:15:57.946
ISOLATE OF THOSE EMPLOYEES.

03:15:58.012 --> 03:16:00.048
AFFECTED AGAIN USER NOW THE

03:16:00.115 --> 03:16:01.316
CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

03:16:01.382 --> 03:16:03.051
WORKING ON THE CONSTRUCTION

03:16:03.118 --> 03:16:05.753
ITSELF- AND SO WE HAVE VERY

03:16:05.820 --> 03:16:07.155
LIMITED IMPACT AND AS I

03:16:07.222 --> 03:16:08.456
REPORTED TO YOU EARLIER MY

03:16:08.523 --> 03:16:10.592
PRESENTATION. WE'RE SAYING THE

03:16:10.658 --> 03:16:12.961
CONSTRUCTION ADVANCE SO AT THAT

03:16:13.027 --> 03:16:15.029
THAT PART IS VERY POSITIVE UP

03:16:15.096 --> 03:16:17.398
WE ARE SEEING IN OTHER AREAS OF

03:16:17.465 --> 03:16:19.267
SOME IMPACT WE DON'T ENTIRELY

03:16:19.334 --> 03:16:21.536
KNOW YOU HEARD MISTER THOMPSON.

03:16:21.603 --> 03:16:23.838
A MOMENT AGO SUGGESTS THERE

03:16:23.905 --> 03:16:26.141
COULD BE IMPACTS TO THE- A CAP

03:16:26.207 --> 03:16:29.244
AND TRADE UP AUCTIONS OF IT IN

03:16:29.310 --> 03:16:32.547
THIS IS A- IT AS A FACT OF THE

03:16:32.614 --> 03:16:34.782
OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE- GLOBAL

03:16:34.849 --> 03:16:37.118
ECONOMY WE ARE- YOU KNOW WE'RE

03:16:37.185 --> 03:16:38.286
WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY SO

03:16:38.353 --> 03:16:39.854
THAT'S- THE ONE AREA WHERE THIS

03:16:39.921 --> 03:16:42.624
QUESTION- I MENTIONED THAT- IN

03:16:42.690 --> 03:16:44.826
THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS-

03:16:44.893 --> 03:16:47.762
WE'VE HAD A- REQUEST. FROM

03:16:47.829 --> 03:16:49.330
COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO

03:16:49.397 --> 03:16:51.633
HAVE MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO

03:16:51.699 --> 03:16:52.967
OUR DRAFT DOCUMENTS THAT WE'VE

03:16:53.034 --> 03:16:55.637
RELEASED IN SOME CASES THEY'VE

03:16:55.703 --> 03:16:57.705
ASKED FOR AS MANY AS- THIRTY OR

03:16:57.772 --> 03:16:58.473
FORTY FIVE DAYS AND WE HAVE

03:16:58.540 --> 03:17:01.142
GRANTED ON. TO THUS FAR FIFTEEN

03:17:01.209 --> 03:17:03.344
SO WE CAN. GIVE THEM MORE TO

03:17:03.411 --> 03:17:05.346
OMIT BUT ALSO TRY TO LIMIT. THE

03:17:05.413 --> 03:17:07.949
IMPACT ON OUR WORK. BUT THE

03:17:08.016 --> 03:17:11.219
ANOTHER PLACE A THAT WE'RE SAY

03:17:11.286 --> 03:17:16.124
OF SOME OF THE IMPACT- AND- I

03:17:16.191 --> 03:17:18.426
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- THERE IS A

03:17:18.493 --> 03:17:21.729
LITTLE LESS. THERE ARE CERTAIN

03:17:21.796 --> 03:17:23.031
DAYS THE RIGHT WORD BUT I WOULD

03:17:23.097 --> 03:17:26.234
SAY THAT- BIDDERS ON THE

03:17:26.301 --> 03:17:27.435
ATTRACTED SYSTEMS CONTRACT ARE

03:17:27.502 --> 03:17:31.439
BEING A CAUTIOUS AND VERY-

03:17:31.506 --> 03:17:33.274
DELIVERED OF IN IN IN SORT OF

03:17:33.341 --> 03:17:35.777
CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY

03:17:35.843 --> 03:17:37.345
OF SHORTY BONDS AND THINGS LIKE

03:17:37.412 --> 03:17:38.980
THAT IN TODAY'S FINANCIAL

03:17:39.047 --> 03:17:41.049
MARKETS SO THAT WAS PART OF THE

03:17:41.115 --> 03:17:43.218
REASON WE DELAYED- BY. BUT

03:17:43.284 --> 03:17:46.054
ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE TRACKING

03:17:46.120 --> 03:17:49.424
SYSTEMS CONTRACT- SO. YEAH

03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:50.858
WE'RE SEEING IT IN A KIND OF

03:17:50.925 --> 03:17:52.961
BITS AND PIECES IN VARIOUS.

03:17:53.027 --> 03:17:54.329
PARTS OF THE PROGRAM AS I SAID

03:17:54.395 --> 03:17:55.830
WE'VE BEEN BLESSED OF THE

03:17:55.897 --> 03:17:57.498
CONSTRUCTION LEVEL ABOUT WE

03:17:57.565 --> 03:17:59.334
ARE. MISSING SOME IMPACTS AND

03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:01.202
SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER PACES

03:18:01.269 --> 03:18:02.704
AND IT'S AND IT'S ENOUGH FOR I

03:18:02.770 --> 03:18:04.672
THINK WE HAVE TO DO A DEEPER. A

03:18:04.739 --> 03:18:06.808
BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE ON THE

03:18:06.874 --> 03:18:08.343
RISK ASSESSMENTS HERE.

03:18:08.409 --> 03:18:10.278
APPRECIATE THAN WHAT. AND IT

03:18:10.345 --> 03:18:11.846
JUST KIND OF KIND OF TAG ALONG

03:18:11.913 --> 03:18:13.481
WITH MISTER THOMPSON SAID ABOUT

03:18:13.548 --> 03:18:16.985
THE CAP AND TRADE- YOUNG YOUR-

03:18:17.051 --> 03:18:19.053
RELIANCE ON IT THUS FAR. WHEN

OPERATING LOSS. THE TWO

03:18:27.328 --> 03:18:30.265
BUSINESSES WILL HAVE OCCURRED

03:18:30.331 --> 03:18:33.501
BECAUSE OF GO AHEAD AND DO THE

03:18:33.568 --> 03:18:34.836
NEW BUDGET NOW SAYS IT

03:18:34.902 --> 03:18:36.404
RETROACTIVELY JANUARY FIRST

03:18:36.471 --> 03:18:36.971
TWENTY TWENTY THEY WON'T BE

03:18:37.038 --> 03:18:40.308
ABLE TO CLAIM THOSE LOSSES AND

03:18:40.375 --> 03:18:42.677
THEN THE TAX CREDITS THAT THEY

03:18:42.744 --> 03:18:44.646
WON'T BE ABLE TO ASSUME THIS

03:18:44.712 --> 03:18:45.913
YEAR I'M THINKING THAT THERE'S

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.582
GONNA BE A REPERCUSSION

03:18:47.649 --> 03:18:52.053
DOWNSTREAM NOT ONLY TO THE

03:18:52.120 --> 03:18:54.455

03:18:54.522 --> 03:18:56.991
BASIS OF THESE THESE COMPANIES

03:18:57.058 --> 03:18:59.894
WON'T HAVE THAT MONEY TO BE

03:18:59.961 --> 03:19:02.063
BUYING EMISSION CREDITS-

03:19:02.130 --> 03:19:04.866

THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE

03:19:11.306 --> 03:19:13.508
PAST SO. I THINK IT CAN BE BE

03:19:13.574 --> 03:19:16.044
WARRANTED- GOING FORWARD THAT

03:19:16.110 --> 03:19:17.845
THE RELIANCE. AND THE

03:19:17.912 --> 03:19:20.081
CONSISTENCY OF THE GREENHOUSE

03:19:20.148 --> 03:19:22.016
GAS FUND THAT CAP AND TRADE

03:19:22.083 --> 03:19:25.119
MIGHT BE IMPACTED DIRECTLY- FAR

03:19:25.186 --> 03:19:26.788
MORE THAN YOU CAN REALIZE JUST

03:19:26.854 --> 03:19:28.856
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

03:19:28.923 --> 03:19:31.159

INVESTING 25% OF THE CABIN

03:19:54.082 --> 03:19:54.515
TRADE REVENUES INTO THIS

03:19:54.582 --> 03:19:56.918
PROJECT. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A

03:19:56.984 --> 03:19:58.586

TRADE DOLLARS GOING TO THIS

03:20:14.369 --> 03:20:16.771
PROGRAM OR ACHIEVING. OF MANY

03:20:16.838 --> 03:20:17.972

FULL OF FILLED OUT THE THIS

03:20:24.078 --> 03:20:28.282
PROGRAM WILL. EXCEED BY ITSELF

03:20:28.349 --> 03:20:30.151
JUST THIS PROJECT- IN TERMS OF

CAP AND TRADE- A PROGRAMS

03:20:35.123 --> 03:20:37.592
FUNDED TO DATE- THAT ARE NOT

03:20:37.658 --> 03:20:39.026
HIGH SPEED RAIL IN TERMS OF

03:20:39.093 --> 03:20:41.429
THE- TOTAL REDUCTION OF CARBON

03:20:41.496 --> 03:20:44.732
DIOXIDE. IN SO- AND THAT'S

03:20:44.799 --> 03:20:45.833
ACCORDING TO CAR THAT'S NOT

03:20:45.900 --> 03:20:47.435
ACCORDING TO US THAT'S THAT'S

03:20:47.502 --> 03:20:49.771
IN IN CARBS DOCUMENTATION SO I

03:20:49.837 --> 03:20:51.172
THINK. ONE I THINK THAT'S

03:20:51.239 --> 03:20:53.674
IMPORTANT A TO A CAP AND TRADE

03:20:53.741 --> 03:20:55.610
IS ALSO IS SUPPOSED TO EXPAND

03:20:55.676 --> 03:20:58.146
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND JOBS

03:20:58.212 --> 03:20:59.313
AND I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION

03:20:59.380 --> 03:21:02.884
THAT WE ARE THE OF VERY. OF

03:21:02.950 --> 03:21:04.385
IMPORT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

03:21:04.452 --> 03:21:06.587
PART OF WHAT WE DO- AND I'M I'M

03:21:06.654 --> 03:21:08.589
VERY PROUD OF THAT THE WORK IN

03:21:08.656 --> 03:21:11.292
THE END SO- AND THREE OF THEY

03:21:11.359 --> 03:21:13.127
WANTED CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO

03:21:13.194 --> 03:21:14.495
LARGELY BE FOCUSED IN.

03:21:14.562 --> 03:21:17.398
DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND AGAIN

03:21:17.465 --> 03:21:18.566
IF YOU LAY OVER THE SORT OF

03:21:18.633 --> 03:21:21.869
THE- THE IDENTIFICATION

03:21:21.936 --> 03:21:24.572
DISADVANTAGED AREAS WITH. ARE

03:21:24.639 --> 03:21:28.342
THE PROPOSED ALIGNMENT- WE LAY

03:21:28.409 --> 03:21:30.244
WE- WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF THE

03:21:30.311 --> 03:21:34.315
POSTER CHILD FOR- FOR INVESTING

03:21:34.382 --> 03:21:35.383
IN THOSE IN THOSE COMMUNITY.

03:21:35.450 --> 03:21:37.285
AND SO IN THAT SENSE I THINK

03:21:37.351 --> 03:21:41.355
IT'S- A- IT IS BEST TO GET THE

03:21:41.422 --> 03:21:42.290
TRADEOFF NINETY WHERE WE ARE.

03:21:42.356 --> 03:21:43.624
THE IN MANY WAYS THE EXAMPLE

03:21:43.691 --> 03:21:45.993
OF- OF WHAT CAPITA RATE

03:21:46.060 --> 03:21:49.030
DOLLARS- COULD DO- THAT WAS

03:21:49.096 --> 03:21:49.764
STANDING ARE PROBLEMS OF THE

03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:52.767
PAST I THINK THE- THE BETTER WE

03:21:52.834 --> 03:21:55.303

03:26:39.153 --> 03:26:42.423
MILLION MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN

03:26:42.490 --> 03:26:43.023
JUST IF I MIGHT ON THAT POINT.

03:26:43.090 --> 03:26:45.292
THE YEAH THE NUMBERS USE FOR

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:47.094
THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION-

03:26:47.161 --> 03:26:48.729
CAME FROM THE MODEL THAT WAS

03:26:48.796 --> 03:26:50.931
USED. FOR THE OF THE STATE RAIL

03:26:50.998 --> 03:26:54.301
PLAN AND THE- OF REAL WORLD OF

03:26:54.368 --> 03:26:56.337
WORK THAT- THE SAN JOAQUIN IS

03:26:56.403 --> 03:26:58.606
AN ACE. OF BOTH SEE TODAY AND

03:26:58.672 --> 03:27:01.675
WHAT THE PROJECT IN THE FUTURE-

03:27:01.742 --> 03:27:04.745
I WOULD JUST SAY THAT TERMS OF-

03:27:04.812 --> 03:27:07.248
YOU KNOW. OF ANY CONFLICT WITH

03:27:07.314 --> 03:27:08.816
US ON WHAT THOSE NUMBERS SAY

03:27:08.883 --> 03:27:11.018
IN. DECISIONS WE MAKE GOING. A

03:27:11.085 --> 03:27:13.020
GOING FOR REMEMBER WE WERE.

03:27:13.087 --> 03:27:14.121
WE'RE NOT THE OPERATE WE'RE NOT

03:27:14.188 --> 03:27:15.790
GONNA BE THE OPERATORS ON THE

03:27:15.856 --> 03:27:17.892
SECTION OF THE INTERIM-SO I

03:27:17.958 --> 03:27:20.594
DON'T- YOU KNOW I WANT TO USE

03:27:20.661 --> 03:27:21.996
THESE NUMBERS TO MAKE. GOOD

03:27:22.062 --> 03:27:23.931
DECISIONS LIKE YOU DO. AND IF

03:27:23.998 --> 03:27:25.900
THERE'S- ADDITIONAL PEER

03:27:25.966 --> 03:27:28.002
REVIEW. AT THAT THAT YOU THINK

03:27:28.068 --> 03:27:31.906
WE SHOULD. UNDERTAKE TO

03:27:31.972 --> 03:27:34.375
SOLIDIFY OR GIVE MORE CREDENCE

03:27:34.441 --> 03:27:36.076
TO. OF THE NUMBERS WILL

03:27:36.143 --> 03:27:38.279
CERTAINLY. I CONSIDER THAT YEAH

03:27:38.345 --> 03:27:40.014
PROJECT THAT IN ONE OF THE

03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:43.117
THINGS TAT REALLY TROUBLES ME

03:27:43.184 --> 03:27:43.884
AS WE LOOK AT. HI THE ADDITION

03:27:43.951 --> 03:27:45.753
DOLLARS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED

03:27:45.820 --> 03:27:47.288
TO ADD THE EXTENSION CLOSELY

03:27:47.354 --> 03:27:49.290
ELECTRIFICATION. THE THIRTY

03:27:49.356 --> 03:27:50.391
YEAR MAINTENANCE CONTRACT

03:27:50.457 --> 03:27:52.693
PROPER RATIONS THE TRAIN

03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:55.462
PROCUREMENT. AND THAT'S TO GET

03:27:55.529 --> 03:27:58.199
SOMEBODY NINETY MINUTES FASTER

03:27:58.265 --> 03:28:02.603
THAN THEY COULD. ON BASS STRING.

03:28:02.670 --> 03:28:05.172
AND AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS

03:28:05.239 --> 03:28:08.075
THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IS

03:28:08.142 --> 03:28:08.876
I DON'T WANNA BE A DETRIMENT

03:28:08.943 --> 03:28:10.377
THIS PROJECT BUT I WANT THE

03:28:10.444 --> 03:28:12.213
MONEY SPENT IN A FASHION. THAT

03:28:12.279 --> 03:28:17.084
IS THE VALUE. AND RIGHT NOW

03:28:17.151 --> 03:28:20.688
THIS WAS IN MY ESTIMATION TWO

03:28:20.754 --> 03:28:21.322
THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS WERE

03:28:21.388 --> 03:28:23.057
TOLD SOMETHING AGAIN YOU WERE

03:28:23.123 --> 03:28:25.025
ACTUALLY CORRECT THEY WERE VERY

03:28:25.092 --> 03:28:27.428
FORTHCOMING SAYING THAT ONLY

03:28:27.494 --> 03:28:28.028
NINE BILLION DOLLARS WAS GOING

03:28:28.095 --> 03:28:30.197
TO BE ALLOCATED GEO MONEY. A

03:28:30.264 --> 03:28:33.701
BOND MONEY BUT WE NEVER GOT A

03:28:33.767 --> 03:28:35.469
PRIVATE PARTNER THE WANTED TO

03:28:35.536 --> 03:28:37.104
TAKE ON THIS RISK BECAUSE OF

03:28:37.171 --> 03:28:40.941
THIS PROJECTS ENORMOUS RISK

03:28:41.008 --> 03:28:44.578
AND- SO THE BRUNT OF THE

03:28:44.645 --> 03:28:46.780
PROJECT IS BEING PAID FOR CAP

03:28:46.847 --> 03:28:47.615
AND TRADE FOR THEM WE WERE

03:28:47.681 --> 03:28:49.183
LUCKY ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME ARE

03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:50.784
AMONG THE AND IN. SOME FEDERAL

03:28:50.851 --> 03:28:55.022
MONEY BUT ON THE V. THE

03:28:55.089 --> 03:28:58.792
ABSOLUTE. ROAD THAT THIS IS

03:28:58.859 --> 03:29:01.195
TAKEN- THERE'S NOT A PRIVATE

03:29:01.262 --> 03:29:02.963
ENTITY ONCE IN SUCH AS WITH A

03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:05.199
TEN FOOT POLE WITH A RISK OF

03:29:05.266 --> 03:29:06.367
CONSTRUCTION AND WE HAVE

03:29:06.433 --> 03:29:08.569
VERSION IS GOING OUT AND DOING

03:29:08.636 --> 03:29:09.470
THEIR PROJECT IN THEIR TIME

03:29:09.536 --> 03:29:11.572
LINES ABSOLUTELY BLOW US WE

03:29:11.639 --> 03:29:12.740
KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:29:12.806 --> 03:29:13.607
ACQUISITION BECAUSE THEY'RE IN

03:29:13.674 --> 03:29:17.945
THE RIGHT AWAY ALREADY- OF- OF.

03:29:18.012 --> 03:29:21.315
OVER A CHOIR OF PARCELS ON YOUR

03:29:21.382 --> 03:29:25.419
OWN THE- BUT- IN THIS PROJECT-

03:29:25.486 --> 03:29:27.688
IN A REALLY NEEDS TO. HIT THE

03:29:27.755 --> 03:29:29.590
PAUSE BUTTON REEVALUATE AND

03:29:29.657 --> 03:29:31.525
AGAIN I'M I'M LOOKING AT SOME

03:29:31.592 --> 03:29:33.727
OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE

03:29:33.794 --> 03:29:35.996
INTENDING TO SPEND. ON THE

03:29:36.063 --> 03:29:38.132
CENTRAL VALLEY WE CAN BYHALF

03:29:38.198 --> 03:29:40.401
OF THE HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE

03:29:40.467 --> 03:29:41.969
CENTRAL VALLEY ALL BRAND NEW

03:29:42.036 --> 03:29:47.007
ELECTRIC CARS. SERIOUSLY AND SO

03:29:47.074 --> 03:29:48.809
ON AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO

03:29:48.876 --> 03:29:51.045
MAKE A BUS CONNECTION AND THEY

03:29:51.111 --> 03:29:51.712
WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A TRAIN

03:29:51.779 --> 03:29:54.081
CONNECTION. IN AT THE END AT

03:29:54.148 --> 03:29:58.385
THIS POINT TIME SO. AGAIN WE

03:29:58.452 --> 03:30:00.988
KNOW MAY ELEVENTH ARMY. I JUST

03:30:01.055 --> 03:30:02.656

IN TRAFFIC ON I. NINETY NINE.

03:30:04.458 --> 03:30:07.161
YEAH I MEAN NO THE AND THE AYE.

03:30:07.227 --> 03:30:08.662
ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE

03:30:08.729 --> 03:30:10.898
PROGRAM HERE IS TO PROVIDE. YOU

03:30:10.965 --> 03:30:12.967
KNOW OF FASTER MOBILITY OPTION

03:30:13.033 --> 03:30:14.335
FOR FOLKS THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE

03:30:14.401 --> 03:30:16.971
THEM TO SIT IN. JOKE IN-

03:30:17.037 --> 03:30:22.643
CONGESTION. AND SO AGAIN.

03:30:22.710 --> 03:30:24.912
MISTER CHAIRMAN I YOU KNOW I

03:30:24.979 --> 03:30:27.681
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OF THE

03:30:27.748 --> 03:30:28.816
ISSUES THAT YOU WANT US TO

03:30:28.882 --> 03:30:30.451
EXPLORE GIVE YOU MORE

03:30:30.517 --> 03:30:32.386
INFORMATION ON I DO THINK

03:30:32.453 --> 03:30:33.687
FUNDAMENTALLY THERE HAS TO BE A

03:30:33.754 --> 03:30:35.956
DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:38.325
A CONTINUED WILL- IN THE STATE

03:30:38.392 --> 03:30:41.562
OF CALIFORNIA TO UP A BILL THIS

03:30:41.628 --> 03:30:44.965
PROJECT AND- AND NOT FOR MY

03:30:45.032 --> 03:30:46.166
MONEY I CERTAINLY HOPE THERE

03:30:46.233 --> 03:30:49.069
IS- BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S THE

03:30:49.136 --> 03:30:50.804
MOST TRANSFORMATIVE THING I'VE

03:30:50.871 --> 03:30:52.906
SEEN IN MY CAREER- IN TERMS OF

03:30:52.973 --> 03:30:54.808
WHAT IT CAN DO AND I UNDERSTAND

03:30:54.875 --> 03:30:58.178
pNOBODY WHO WISHES WE COULD

03:30:58.245 --> 03:31:00.014
BUILD MORE THAN ME IN TERMS OF

03:31:00.080 --> 03:31:01.849
A BIGGER SEGMENT IN A SEGMENT

03:31:01.915 --> 03:31:03.484
THAT COULD REACH MORE PLACES

03:31:03.550 --> 03:31:05.719
BUT I AM CONSTRAINED BY

03:31:05.786 --> 03:31:09.556
AVAILABLE MONEY. AND SO WHAT WE

03:31:09.623 --> 03:31:10.924
ARE PROPOSING WITH THE MONEY

03:31:10.991 --> 03:31:12.726
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- I

03:31:12.793 --> 03:31:14.061
SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IS NOT

03:31:14.128 --> 03:31:16.163
JUST. THIS ELECTRIFIED SECTION

03:31:16.230 --> 03:31:17.998
BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES. BUT

03:31:18.065 --> 03:31:19.733
IT IS ALSO COMPLETING THE

03:31:19.800 --> 03:31:21.702
ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ALL THE WAY

03:31:21.769 --> 03:31:23.103
THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

03:31:23.170 --> 03:31:25.372
FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA IN

03:31:25.439 --> 03:31:27.041
ANAHEIM. COMPLETING ALL OF THE

03:31:27.107 --> 03:31:29.910
BOOK AND PROJECTS OF BOTH LA-

03:31:29.977 --> 03:31:33.647
AND THE BAY AREA- AND ONCE THAT

03:31:33.714 --> 03:31:35.382
IS DONE. I THINK WE CAN REALLY

03:31:35.449 --> 03:31:37.885
START TO DE REST. WHAT THE REST

03:31:37.951 --> 03:31:39.753
OF THE REST OF THE PROJECT IS.

03:31:39.820 --> 03:31:40.921
GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THEN I

03:31:40.988 --> 03:31:42.756
DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY WILL

03:31:42.823 --> 03:31:44.892
NOT SEE PRIVATE MONEY. A COME

03:31:44.958 --> 03:31:46.193
IN I THINK WE HAVE TO GET SOME

03:31:46.260 --> 03:31:48.629
OF THIS RISK OUT OF THE WAY-

03:31:48.695 --> 03:31:50.831
AND THAT'S ONLY A CHEAT BY.

03:31:50.898 --> 03:31:53.033
WORK YEAH AND I YOU KNOW AGAIN

03:31:53.100 --> 03:31:54.902

YEARS. CONTINGENCY IN REST

03:32:00.407 --> 03:32:02.276
MEANS MISTAKES MISTAKES MADE.

BUSINESS IN THE CONSTRUCTION

03:32:29.903 --> 03:32:33.507
INDUSTRY- AND SERIOUSLY- WHEN I

WHY THERE'S NO PRIVATE MONEY IN

TO PREVENT IT FROM EVER TURNING

04:15:28.012 --> 04:15:30.715
AN OPERATING PROJECT BECAUSE OF

04:15:30.782 --> 04:15:32.517
THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE

PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THIS

04:15:34.719 --> 04:15:36.421
PROJECT WHICH IS WHY IT IS

04:15:36.487 --> 04:15:38.856
ULTIMATELY IN FEASIBLE. THE

04:15:38.923 --> 04:15:40.625
IDEA THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE

04:15:40.692 --> 04:15:43.294
THE SOLE FUNDER OF A MERCED TO

BAKERSFIELD WINE IS NOT ONLY

04:15:46.164 --> 04:15:49.600
RIDICULOUS IT'S NOW IN FEASIBLE

04:15:51.402 --> 04:15:54.105
CRISIS. EVEN IF THAT PROJECT

DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS GRAPH

04:26:57.935 --> 04:27:00.337
BUSINESS PLAN. IT'S CLEAR TO ME

04:27:00.404 --> 04:27:06.176
THAT IT'S BASED. LIFE I GUESS I

04:27:07.845 --> 04:27:08.979
BUSINESS PLAN THAT I'VE SEEN TO

DATE HAS A BUILT ON MISLEADING

04:27:10.814 --> 04:27:11.915
OR OUTRIGHT INACCURATE

04:27:11.982 --> 04:27:13.751
INFORMATION IT HAS NOT. EVER

04:27:13.817 --> 04:27:16.787
BEEN ATTAINED. I'M DONE. THIS

04:27:16.854 --> 04:27:20.190
HAS TO STOP. IF WE WERE

04:27:20.257 --> 04:27:21.191
CONSTRAINED BY THE CURRENT

04:27:21.258 --> 04:27:22.626
GLOBAL PANDEMIC I WOULD

04:27:22.693 --> 04:27:23.894
SCHEDULE MORE HEARINGS TO

AN ORGANIZATION SEEMS HELL BENT

04:27:33.270 --> 04:27:33.737
ON BUILDING ELECTRIC TRAIN

04:27:33.804 --> 04:27:35.572
WHETHER IT'S- WHETHER OR NOT

04:27:35.639 --> 04:27:38.542
IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'VE

04:27:38.609 --> 04:27:40.377

PROJECT BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE.

04:27:43.080 --> 04:27:44.214
IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION I

04:27:44.281 --> 04:27:45.349
BELIEVE WE SHOULD DISCUSS WAYS

04:27:45.416 --> 04:27:46.884
TO CHANGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:49.486
STRUCTURE OF THE AUTHORITY.

04:27:49.553 --> 04:27:50.888
THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE MANAGED

04:27:50.954 --> 04:27:51.955
BY A DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY

04:27:52.022 --> 04:27:54.191
ANSWERABLE TO THIS AGENCY

04:27:54.258 --> 04:27:56.293
SECRETARY AND THE GOVERNOR. AND

04:27:56.360 --> 04:27:57.594
SUCCESS AND FAILURE SHOULD

04:27:57.661 --> 04:27:58.362
DIRECTLY REFLECT ON THE

04:27:58.429 --> 04:28:00.664
ADMINISTRATION NOT ON ON

04:28:00.731 --> 04:28:03.734
ACCOUNTABLE BOARD. AS IT STANDS

04:28:03.801 --> 04:28:04.768
THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY

04:28:04.835 --> 04:28:05.936
FEELS TOO MUCH LIKE THE

04:28:06.003 --> 04:28:06.904
CONSULTANTS ARE RUNNING THE

04:28:06.970 --> 04:28:09.606
SHOW AND NO ONE IS LOOKING OUT.

04:28:09.673 --> 04:28:11.975
ON THE STATE'S BEHALF.

04:28:12.042 --> 04:28:13.076

GENERAL CONTRACTOR ALMOST MY

CHARGE OF IT SUCH A DIFFICULT

04:29:11.668 --> 04:29:13.737
CHALLENGE. INSTEAD THE

04:29:13.804 --> 04:29:14.605
ADMINISTRATION HIRED A

04:29:14.671 --> 04:29:16.907
LEGISLATIVE STAFF PERSON TO BE

04:29:16.974 --> 04:29:17.341
THE DIRECTOR OF THIS

04:29:17.407 --> 04:29:18.475
ORGANIZATION. HE'S A VERY NICE

04:29:18.542 --> 04:29:22.079
MAN. IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY HIRE

04:29:22.145 --> 04:29:23.580
THIS PERSON NOT BECAUSE HE CAN

04:29:23.647 --> 04:29:24.314
ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT IS

04:29:24.381 --> 04:29:26.049

MONEY IS BEING SPENT THE BEST

04:29:27.150 --> 04:29:29.086
WAY POSSIBLE IT'S BECAUSE HIS

04:29:29.152 --> 04:29:30.787
EXPERT EXPERTISE IS TO CONVINCE

04:29:30.854 --> 04:29:33.323
THE LEGISLATURE TO DO WHAT HE

04:29:33.390 --> 04:29:35.192
OF THE GOVERNOR WANT THEM TO DO.

04:29:35.259 --> 04:29:37.895
JUST PUSH THE PROJECT FOR. I

04:29:37.961 --> 04:29:39.763
FRANKLY CANNOT TAKE SERIOUSLY

ANY PLAN TO TRY TO SELL ME ON

04:29:41.164 --> 04:29:42.633
ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS WHEN THE

04:29:42.699 --> 04:29:44.601
PEOPLE IN CHARGE HAVE NO IDEA

04:29:44.668 --> 04:29:46.136
HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT BEING

04:29:46.203 --> 04:29:51.141
PROPOSED. I HOPE THE AUTHORITY.

04:29:51.208 --> 04:29:56.413
AFTER MUCH. CONSIDERATION IN

04:29:56.480 --> 04:29:59.182

GROUP GROUP SENDS THE BUSINESS

04:30:01.485 --> 04:30:03.820
PLAN BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD

04:30:03.887 --> 04:30:05.756
WITH MORE REALISTIC APPROACH

04:30:05.822 --> 04:30:06.723
AND I'LL BE WRITING A LETTER TO

04:30:06.790 --> 04:30:08.492
THE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT I DO

04:30:08.559 --> 04:30:09.993
NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS PLAN

04:30:10.060 --> 04:30:13.130
I BELIEVE IT'S MISSTATING FACTS

04:30:13.196 --> 04:30:16.967
AND I WANT TO SEE REAL NUMBERS.

04:30:17.034 --> 04:30:18.068
I'M ALL ABOUT PEOPLE GOING TO

04:30:18.135 --> 04:30:21.204
WORK. IN SUPPORT OF THAT I'VE

04:30:21.271 --> 04:30:21.805
BEEN THE CARPENTERS UNION MOST

04:30:21.872 --> 04:30:25.409
OF MY LIFE. BUT I DO NOT WANT

04:30:25.475 --> 04:30:26.577
TO SEE THE PEOPLE'S MONEY TO

04:30:26.643 --> 04:30:28.645
SPEND IF THE MONEY IS SPENT

04:30:28.712 --> 04:30:31.648
ELSEWHERE ON A BETTER VALUE.

04:30:31.715 --> 04:30:34.885
PEOPLE STILL WILL GO TO WORK.

04:30:34.952 --> 04:30:36.820
WITH THAT MAJOR IN THIS SERIES

THANK YOU.
