COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFUL FEEDBACK FROM COMMITTEE STAFF OBVIOUSLY OUR WILDFIRE HAS BEEN FRONT AND CENTER IN IN NATURAL RESOURCES AND IN THE STATE AND THUS FAR -- THE LEGISLATURE HAS REALLY STEPPED UP AND IN FACT OF AB ONE SIXTY ONE OF A BUDGET TRAILER THAT IS JUST NOW OF BEING APPROVED ADDS ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO WILDFIRE RESILIENCE THE RESOURCES AGENCY HAS RELEASE THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN WHICH SETS FORTH TARGETS OVER FIVE YEARS OR MORE AND WHAT TO DO ON PRESCRIBED FIRE AND VARIOUS OTHER FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS BROUGHT FORTH THE MONEY TO SUPPORT THAT PLAN BUT RIGHT NOW IN STATUTE IT'S BASICALLY WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES EVERY YEAR IT IS NOT IT IN STATUTE TO A MULTI YEAR PROGRAM THAT MATCHES WHAT OF THE RESOURCES AGENCY IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS BASICALLY TAKE THOSE GOALS AND PUT THEM IN STATUTE THEN -- CREATES A BODY TO OVERLOOK THEM EVERY YEAR HOPEFULLY ADAPTIVELY MANAGE WHAT WORKS AND DOESN'T WORK AND ALSO SETS FORTH FOR THE FIRST TIME A CLEAR TRACKING SYSTEM TO MONITOR THE NUMBER OF ACRES OR THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TAKEN IN REGARD TO WILDFIRE OF PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE AND SO THIS BILL A REALLY PUTS TOGETHER IN MULTIPLE YEARS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN ONE YEAR THROUGH THE BUDGET AND MULTIPLE YEARS IN PLANTS THERE OUTSIDE OF THE LEGISLATURE'S DIRECT PURVIEW AND -- IT HAS BEEN A MOVING TARGET TO SOME OF THE GOALS OF CHANGED OR ADDED TO WE'VE AMENDED AMEND TO THE BILL WE HAVE TRIED TO DEAL WITH ISSUES PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LANDSCAPE OF CHAPARRAL AND WE HAVE THEREFORE AMENDED TO OUR THAT IN THE BILL ALONG THE WAY AND THUS FAR IT HAS BEEN A BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FOR THE BILL MOVING FORWARD FOR THE FIRST TIME WE HAVE A COUPLE OF -- LETTERS OF OPPOSITION AND WHILE I SHOULD PROBABLY REPRESENTS REFER TO THEM IN THE CLOTHES I THINK IT'S GOOD TO REFER TO THEM NOW BECAUSE THE LETTERS DISAGREE WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS DOING AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND ARE USING THIS BILL TO OF FORCED THEIR OPPOSITION WHEN BASICALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CHANGE DIRECTION OR THE ADMINISTRATION SHOULD CHANGE DIRECTION IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A RESPONSE TO THOSE CRITICISMS REGARDLESS OF WHAT IS ADOPTED THIS BILL PUTS IT IN A PLAN MULTIPLE YEARS AND TRACKS IT IN A CLEAR

ASSEMBLY MEMBER SERETIDE CENTER LATER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- THERE'S NOTHING MORE FRUSTRATING THAN WATCHING THIS EVOLVE OVER THE YEARS AND NOT HAVING A STRATEGIC PLAN -- THE FIRST I THINK THE FIRST STEP IN DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM IS IT'S CREATING THAT PLAN SO THAT YOU HAVE A COORDINATED EFFORT BETWEEN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS INCLUDING THE CHAPARRAL THAT TALKING ABOUT THE FORESTS -- THE INTERFACE AREAS AND ALL OF THAT -- IT IS A HUGE PROBLEM A DISJOINTED EFFORT AND I THINK YOUR BILL HELPS ADDRESS THAT PART OF IT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO GOING FORWARD WITH THIS AND AGAIN AND HOPING -- FIND EACH OF THOSE EFFORTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT NEED TO DO THAT SCALFARI OR PRIVATE LANDOWNERS FOREST MANAGEMENT FOLKS -- BECAUSE WE DON'T GET A GRIP ON THIS -- IT'S IT'S JUST GOING TO CONTINUE YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR -- -- IS THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY CHAPARRAL IT IS OUT THERE AS ONE WHO HAS ACTUALLY STOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WHILE IT'S BURNING LIKE FURY -- I CAN TELL YOU -- THE MOONSCAPE THAT ENSUES AND THE FLIGHTS IN AND THE MUD SLIDES THAT HAPPEN AFTERWARDS -- IS FAR BUT THEY DID IT IT'S GOES FAR BEYOND THE DAMAGE THAT IS CREATED BY DOING SOME MITIGATION EFFORTS LIKE THIS PLAN HOPEFULLY WILL OUTLINE SO THAT WE CAN GO FOR TO MAKE IT HAPPEN SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD A PLAN ON SUPPORTING IT TODAY AND -- I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR WORK ON THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FLORIDA SENATE LATE I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- AN ECHO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING CHIEF HAS SAID -- HIS SERVICE PALES IN COMPARISON TO WHAT I HAVE DONE BUT I'M ALSO STOOD IN THIS TWO THOUSAND THREE WAS THE FIRST THE CEDAR FIRE WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CAMPAIGN COMPLEX FIRE THAT I ACTUALLY WAS ON IN SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND IT WAS OVERGROWN THEN IN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS LATER WE STILL HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM SO IT'S INTERESTING WHEN I HEAR THE CHAPERONES TO SPEAKING ABOUT THE SAME OLD FAILED POLICIES I THINK WE POTENTIALLY SHOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND NOT TENNIS ON CALIFORNIA NOT PIN THIS ON THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT GO OUT ON A DAILY BASIS AND FIGHT AND RISK THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES TO FOR A PROBLEM THAT WE AS A STATE AND QUITE FRANKLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAD AN UNWILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS SO I ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD WE NEED TO DO FAR MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT OUR STATE OUR AIR QUALITY THE HEALTH OF OUR FORCE ALL OF THIS IS PART OF THE SOLUTION IS NOT THE ONLY THING BUT CERTAINLY A PART OF IT SO I APPRECIATE THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU -- CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES IN YOU ARE I KNOW I SHOULD JUST ASK FOR AN IPHONE BUT BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM ALL THE WITNESSES AND FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ONE THANK YOU NOTES ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND I HAD A HUGE FIRE IT IS IN OUR DISTRICTS LAST AUGUST HE WAS ACTUALLY EVACUATED I WAS PACKED AND READY TO GO AND HE AND I VISITED A BURN SCAR TWO WEEKS AGO AND AS WE WENT IN WITH THE PEOPLE MOVES IN EIGHTY EIGHT HUNDRED ACRE PARCEL THAT WAS ALMOST COMPLETELY BURNED OVER -- THE PEOPLE THAT MANAGE TO LAND TOLD US THAT THEY HAD DONE A PRESCRIBED FIRE NOT LONG BEFORE AND THEN IN THE MIDST OF WERE NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HOUSES WERE LOST THERE WAS ONE PLACE THAT SOME HOUSES WERE SAVED AND IT WAS PROTECTED BY THE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT IT HAPPENED NOT LONG BEFORE THAT FIRE AND ONE WITNESS SAID A HUNDRED YEARS OF POLICIES AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THE SAME AT ALL I WOULD SAY FOR MAYBE EIGHTY YEARS OR EIGHTY FIVE YEARS THERE WAS A POLICY OF FIRES SUPPRESSION AND NOT OTHER THINGS AND WHAT REALLY HAS CHANGED THIS PRESCRIBED FIRE FUEL MANAGEMENT LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCILS IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I ASKED IN OUR BUDGET HEARING THIS YEAR IS HOW MUCH OF THE FIRE PREVENTION MONEY WILL GO TO LOCALS WILL GO TO LOCAL FIRE SAFE COUNCIL I GOT AMAZINGLY BIG NUMBER WAS A SURPRISE IT WAS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OR SOMETHING AND SO THE REAL QUESTION IS IS HOW WE NAVIGATE THAT SHIFT IN RESPONSE AND HOW WE MAKE SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY PLAN AND HOW WE ACTUALLY TRACK WHAT IT IS SO THAT WERE TRANSPARENT IN WHAT HAS HAPPENED THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES I WOULD ASTRONOMICAL THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER FLORA AND I DON'T HAVE A SECOND SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAY

USE OF COMMON SENSE EXEMPTIONS FOR PROJECT PROJECTS LOCATED ON CORTEZ OF THE SITES I'M GONNA KNOW RIGHT THE BEGINNING THAT THIS COMMONSENSE -- EXCEPTION A SOME WHO'VE BEEN AROUND A SEQUIN THESE ISSUES WOULD RECOGNIZE IT AS THE GENERAL RULE EXCEPTION WHICH WAS ITS ORIGINAL NAME AND MORE RECENTLY HAS BEEN A REFER TO US AS A COMMONSENSE EXCEPTION THE CARD BECAUSE HE LISTS ORIGINALLY CREATED IN NINETEEN EIGHTIES BY THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF MY FATHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER FORMER SO MEMBER DONNA CORTEZ HE IS A LIST OF CONTAMINATED SITES CREATED BY VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPILING INFORMATION ABOUT THE LOCATION OF HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RELEASE SITES STATE LAW CURRENTLY PROHIBITS CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM BEING GRANTED TO PROJECTS IMPACTING SITES LISTED ON THE CORTES LIST BECAUSE OF CONTAMINATION ON THE SITE POSE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THE ENVIRONMENT HOWEVER THIS WAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY REVISIT IN OVER A DECADE AS A RESULT SOME LOCAL AGENCIES HAVE SKIRTED THE LAW BY GRANTING EXEMPTIONS PURSUANT TO COMMONSENSE ALLOWING PROJECTS TO BE CARRIED OUT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ADEQUATE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW DOING THESE PROJECTS WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND APPROPRIATE CLEANUP POSE A SEVERE RISK HEALTH RISKS LABORS WORKING ON THE SITE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT LIVE NEAR THE SITE FUTURE FUTURE TENANTS OF THE PROPERTY AND SO FORTH SB THIRTY SEVEN CLARIFIES THE WATER CAN FIRM THAT THE COMMON SENSE EXEMPTIONS CANNOT BE GRANTED FOR PROJECTS ON CRITICIZING THE SITES THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES A NARROW PATH FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED IS CLOSED TO RECEIVE A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION IN ORDER TO STREAMLINE PROJECTS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT I WANT TO EXPRESS MY STRONG COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR

APPROVAL AND ALLOW CITIES TO AVOID STATE REVIEW DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH EXEMPTIONS ARE TO APPLY ONLY TO THOSE PROJECTS REPRESENT NO POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS IF YOU HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY BY PATENT SEEK REVIEW IF THIS MECHANISM IN FORTUNATE REALITY THAT SOME OF THE MOST THREATENING HAZARDS -- I MEAN TO GIVE A CONSTRUCTION SITE ARE THOSE WORKERS CANNOT READILY SEE OR FEEL SUCH HAZARDS

IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR RIGHT I RESPECT SEVERAL ASPECTS IN THE INTENT OF THIS BILL ENSURE THE PROTECTIONS OF THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND THOSE WORKING ON POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS LAND RECITES HOWEVER I DO A SHOW CONCERNS WHICH I HOPE CAN BE ADDRESSED SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS TO THE LOCAL AGENCIES MAKING THE SITES OF THE EQUITY IS THE LATEST IN IMPACTED BY THIS MEASURE WERE LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE SITES THESE SITES WERE COMMONLY CLEANED UP AND REPAIRED AND OVERSEEN BY LOCAL AGENCIES WHO WERE THEN IN TURN OVER SHE BY THE REGIONAL WATER BOARDS ARE THESE SITES WILL NOW NOT QUALIFY UNDER THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION WITH YOUR BILL FURTHERMORE THIS ALSO MEANS THAT MANY MINOR ALTERATIONS IT IS STATED BY RC RC IN THEIR TESTIMONY SO I WON'T REPEAT UNDUE AND UNNECESSARY -- TIME HERE SO I I'M JUST SIMPLY AN ASSET OR THE THE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS I'M GONNA LAY OFF THE DAY OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS -- AND HOLD MY VOTE TELL THE FLOOR THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN -- THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR IT I ACTUALLY HAVE A SIMILAR CONCERN -- BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF THERE IS A WAY TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN PROJECTS THAT WERE HIGH RISK FOR DISTURBING SOIL FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY CONTAMINATED FROM PROJECTS THAT ARE MINOR I DIDN'T EVEN IF THE SOIL WERE CONTAMINATED WOULDN'T BECAUSE -- YOU KNOW AND -- IN EXASPERATION OF A OF A EXISTING SITUATION THERE WAS A WAY TO PARSE THAT OUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL AND IN ADDITION IT'S ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING ALTHOUGH I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE CORTESE LIST CERTAINLY THAT ONCE A PROJECT IS ON THAT LIST IT'S VERY HARD TO GET OFF EVEN IF IT'S BEEN REMEDIATED AND SO -- GIVEN THAT SEE WHAT YOU KNOW IS USE QUITE A BIT FOR ADDRESSING CONCERNS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE UNDERLYING CONCERN THAT THE SEQUEL REVIEW IS LOOKING AT YOU KNOW CONCERNS JUST ABOUT DEVELOPMENT -- ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE SOMETIMES WANT TO DELAY OR STOP THE PROJECT I HAVE A WORRY THAT THIS COULD BE USED -- EVEN FOR SITES WHERE THERE REALLY IS NOT GOING TO BE AN IMPACT -- THE SITES WHERE THE CHANGES ARE MINOR SITES WHERE -- REMEDIATION THAT WAS ADEQUATE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALSO TO STILL ASK FOR REMEDIATION ASKED FOR AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW I'M JUST -- NOT SURE THAT -- -- THEY'RE SORT OF ENOUGH TIMES WERE LOCALS DON'T ASK FOR THAT AT TIMES WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE TO JUSTIFY WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO THE PROJECTS THAT DON'T REALLY NEED THIS LEVEL OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS YOU KNOW AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET MORE HOUSING BUILT -- AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING NEW DEVELOPMENTS YOU KNOW TO THE NOW ALL OVER THE STATE SO I'M ALSO GONNA AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT MAYBE TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF IT THANKS THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE I DON'T SEE ANY -- I WANT TO THANK YOU AS YOU MENTIONED -- IN IN THE BEGINNING THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH OUR COMMITTEE -- ON SOME OF THESE CONCERNS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU UP ON THEM THE CONCERNS ON MINE OF THE MINOR PROJECTS THE REMEDIATION AS YOU MENTIONED DIÇN I HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE SOON BUT THANK YOU I WILL BE SUPPORTING TODAY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THAT LANGUAGE SOON THANK YOU MANAGER YEAH I FEEL MAYOREDLEE I'M SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TODAY -- IF NOT ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN -- -- WORK THROUGH AND A FEW OF THEM CONTINUE THE WORK THROUGH -- BUT LET ME JUST ADDRESS -- THE CHAIRS CONCERNED PERSON COMMIT ABSOLUTELY TO -- YOU KNOW IN A MATTER OF DAYS BACK IN WEEKS WITH AMENDMENTS BUT IN DAYS BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE ABOUT THE SENTENCE AWAY FROM -- CLEARING UP THE LAST ISSUE -- THANKS AGAIN TO COMMITTEE STAFF -- WORKING HARD AND REALLY PARSING THINGS OUT WITH US -- THAT SAID -- I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY BEING VERY VERY CLEAR AS TO WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT THERE ON THE STREET THAT IS SO DANGEROUS RIGHT NOW THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION IS NOT ALTHOUGH IT MAY SOUND LIKE IT AND AND AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE BUT IT ISN'T IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A A MISLEADING TITLE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE A TEMPORARY FENCE WHICH MONEY TO SAY PARENTHETICALLY IS ORDINARILY NOT A SEQUEL PROJECT IN THE FIRST PLACE SO WE QUESTION SIGNIFICANTLY HOW SOME FOLKS ARE WORRIED ABOUT PUTTING A TEMPORARY FENCE UP WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN NEED ACROSS THE COUNTER TO GET A PERMIT LET ALONE A SEEK REVIEW BUT THAT SAID WITH THE COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION ACTUALLY SAYS IS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY NO POSSIBILITY WITH CERTAINTY BASED ON EVIDENCE THAT THE PROJECT IN THIS CAN ONLY BE APPLIED TO A PROJECT THAT IS LISTED IN THE SEQUEL GOT EYES AS A PROJECT YOU KNOW NOT TO FIXING THE SHINGLES ON A ROOF WHICH IS A REPAIR A SINGLE PROJECT -- IF YOU CAN MEET ALL THOSE STANDARDS THEN YOU CAN SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NEXT IS EXEMPT FROM ANY TRIGGERING BY THE CORTES THE LIST OF SEEK REVIEW NOW THE PROJECT THAT COMES NEXT MAY STILL TRIGGER SEQUEL REVIEW BECAUSE IT'S A STRUCTURE A HOUSE HAS TRAFFIC IMPACTED HAS WATER RUNOFF IMPACT WHATEVER BUT FOLKS HAVE BEEN USING THE WITH CERTAINTY AND WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BASED ON EVIDENCE -- REALLY IN VIOLATION OF OF IN SOME CASES ALL THREE OF THOSE TERMS WE WE REVIEWED AS PART OF ALL THIS WORK THE APPLICATION AND I DON'T KNOW THAT EVERYONE -- MAYBE MR STONE AND A COUPLE OTHERS KNOW THIS SITE BUT -- THE HUNTERS POINT SITE IN THE BAY AREA WHICH PUT IN AN APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTION IN PART BASED ON THE CORTES THE LIST TO DO WORK ON THAT SITE REMEDIATION WORK WHAT WE CALL FACE TO REMEDIATION WORK WHICH IS A SEQUEL PROJECT BY DEFINITION THAT INCLUDES TRENCHING TAKING OIL OFF THE TOP OF THE BAY OFF THE TOP OF THE BAY REALLY THIS IS A KNOWN CONTAMINATED SITES OKAY AND THEIR ARGUMENT WAS WITH CERTAINTY WITHOUT GOING ANY FURTHER WITH CERTAINTY THERE IS NO POSSIBILITY OF OF -- SIGNIFICAN ENVIRONMENT IMPACT TO GO FORWARD BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND THEY WROTE EIGHT PAGES THEY GAVE THE EVIDENCE THEY SAID HERE'S WHAT'S ALL OUT THERE AND HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BUT THEY WANTED TO BE ABLE TO DECLARE UNILATERALLY THAT IT WAS OKAY TO PROCEED FORWARD WITHOUT EVEN AN INITIAL STUDY NO ONE WAS ASKING FOR IT BERMAN WHAT IMPACT REPORT NOT EVEN AN INITIAL STUDY COMMONSENSE EXEMPTION SO THAT'S ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES WAS LITIGATION PENDING IN THE STATE AND SO FORTH SO WE KNOW WE NEED TO -- DEAL WITH THIS NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS ON THE CLOSE SITE ISSUE -- THIS BILL IS THIS BILL IS NOW DESIGNED TO ALLOW PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFICATED AS CLOSED BUT TO PROCEED FORWARD UNDER ORDINARY CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS RIGHT PROJECTS THAT WOULD ORDINARILY BE EXEMPT FROM SEQUEL ANYWAY CAN PROCEED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT THE THEY'RE STILL LISTED ON ON THE SITE AS ONE OF THE FORTY THOUSAND THAT'S A CLOSE SITE WHAT WE NEED TO DO AND I WANT AGAIN COMMIT TO THE CHAIR IS COME BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT THE SUBORDINATES OF DTS SEE LOCALLY WHO ARE AUTHORIZED TO CLOSE OR SITES SINCE AND CERTIFY THEM ARE ENUMERATED IN THE BILL WE WE THOUGHT IT WAS UNDERSTOOD IT'S CLEAR THAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE US TO YOU KNOW ENUMERATE AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO GO IN IT INCLUDES THE SAAB HAS MISSILES BUT ONCE THEIR CLOTHES WERE TRYING TO SAY IF YOU'RE NEXT YOU'RE NEXT STEP OF YOUR PROJECT WOULD ORDINARILY GO THROUGH CATEGORICAL -- A CATEGORY EXEMPTION ANYWAY THANK WE GOT TO TRUST THE LOCALS ON THAT -- SO THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT -- IN WE RECENTLY SAID WE ONLY ONCE SINCE WAYS BECAUSE I'M WE'VE TAKEN THE AMENDMENTS OF COMMITTEES ALREADY SUGGESTED WE HAVE -- UP TO A POINT IN THE CHAIR IN THAT IN THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT KNOWS WHERE THAT IS WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT ONE FINAL SENTENCE I THINK IT'S ONE FINAL SENTENCE IN TERMS OF WHERE WE -- WHERE WE DERIVE -- WHERE WE DERIVE THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE I MEAN TO ALLOW MAINTENANCE IN REMEDIATION TO GO FORWARD ON OPEN SITES THAT'S WITH TOO MANY CONSULTANT IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF IN YOU'RE ASKING US TO DO NOW AND -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY ON AN OPEN SITE OF SOMEBODY WANTING TO DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD ORDINARILY NOT TRIGGER SEQUEL AND ON THE OPEN SIDE THEY DON'T WANT THE LIST TO AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGER THE TRIGGER SEEK REVIEW OBVIOUSLY -- THAT LANGUAGE EVEN IF IT'S ONLY A SENTENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT SO WE'RE NOT OPENING UP THE FLOODGATES TO SOMETHING LIKE I JUST DESCRIBED WITH THE HUNTERS POINT APPLICATION RIGHT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT IT JUST COMING IN ON AN OPEN SITE IN DOING THE KIND OF WORK -- THAT OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BROUGHT UP IN THE QUEUE IN A SO WE'RE VERY CLOSE WE'RE COMMITTED WE'LL KEEP WORKING HARD AND I KNOW WE'LL GET THERE AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THE WORST THING THAT WE COULD DO -- IS TO DO NOTHING GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AND BELIEVE WE NEED A MOTION HELLO HOLD ON PLEASE OKAY THERE'S WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO BE PASSED

WAY TO ELECTRIFY INDY CAR TONIGHT OUR FUEL SUPPLY WE CAN CONVERT ARE ABUNDANT RENEWABLE RESOURCES INTO A FLEXIBLE ZERO CARBON FUEL THAT CAN DISPLACING MANY FOSSIL FUEL APPLICATIONS INCREASING RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY WE SECONDLY WE CLEAN HYDROGEN WE CAN REPURPOSE VALUABLE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AFFORDABLE ENERGY TRANSITION AS AN EXAMPLE OF LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF WATER AND POWER IS IN THE PROCESS OF CONVERTING ITS LAST REMAINING COAL PLANT LOCATED IN CENTRAL UTAH TWO EIGHT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT HYDROGEN FUELED COMBINED CYCLE GAS TURBINE AND THE LAST REASON MEAN THERE ARE MANY OTHER BENEFITS BUT THE THIRD I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TODAY'S THAT GREEN HYDROGEN IS THE TREMENDOUS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND JOB CREATING EXPORT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD

COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POPULATIONS REPLACING THESE VEHICLES WITH ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THESE COMMUNITIES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIVERSE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE FLEET OWNERS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ADD MORE TOOLS TO THE STATE'S TOOLBOX THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO GET THE THE STATE TO THINK
