CALIFORNIA TWENTY TWENTY IS A TALE OF TWO STATES IT IS IN DICKENS WORDS BOTH THE BEST OF TIMES AND THE WORST OF TIMES. THE BEST IS REPRESENTED NOT ONLY BY A STRONG ECONOMY. AND UNPRECEDENTED INNOVATION BUT BY THE WORK OF THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY TOGETHER. TOGETHER WE HAVE MADE HEADWAY ON THE ENVIRONMENT ON PREDATORY LENDING. ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS MOVED FORWARD WITH US. BUT OUR STRONG ECONOMY AND UNPRECEDENTED INNOVATION HAVE BEEN ACCOMPANIED BY SLOW PROGRESS FOR THE HAVE NOTS. AND BY UNPRECEDENTED INEQUALITY. THAT IS THE WORST OF OUR TIMES. I AM BEGINNING TO IS TO TIRE OF SAYING IT EACH YEAR BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. WE CAN'T SOLVE OUR HOUSING CRISIS WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE ECONOMIC UNDERPINNINGS. ON THAT SCORE I'M HAPPY THAT LAST SESSIONS LEGISLATION MADE A STRONG STATEMENT. IN SUPPORT OF PROTECTING WORKERS IN THE NEW ECONOMY. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS AND THE GOVERNOR ON THESE ISSUES THIS YEAR. TODAY I WALK IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO THE ASSEMBLY TO CHAMBERS NOW IT IS MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE THE PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE CALIFORNIA SENATE THE HONORABLE TONI ATKINS.

JOIN ME IN WELCOMING OUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT LOVELY INTRODUCTION MADAM PRESIDENT PRO TEM AND- I'M HAPPY TO TEACH YOU A LITTLE GREEK BUT I THINK FOR MOST OF US BOB IS REALLY ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. LAST YEAR WE ASSEMBLED IN THIS HISTORIC CHAMBER FOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S FIRST STATE OF THE STATE ADDRESS. BY ALL ACCOUNTS TWENTY NINETEEN WAS A BUSY YEAR FOR CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. LEGISLATION INTRODUCED BY THIS BODY AND SIGNED INTO LAW BY OUR GOVERNOR IS ALREADY AT WORK ADDRESSING HOUSING HOMELESSNESS WILD FIRES EDUCATION DISCRIMINATION AND SO MUCH MORE. WITH OUR ECONOMY STILL STRONG AND WITH MANY CHALLENGES STILL LOOMING IT'S CLEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY WILL BE ANOTHER LANDMARK HERE FOR CALIFORNIA PUBLIC POLICY. BEFORE I INTRODUCE THE GOVERNOR I'D LIKE TO OFFER A WORD OF PERSONAL GRATITUDE AS A FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR HIMSELF HE COULD SEE THE UNDER UTILIZED CAPACITY AT THIS OFFICE. HIS SUPPORT HAS STRENGTHENED OUR WORK IN BOTH PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION AND ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND LAST YEAR JUST A FEW WEEKS AFTER TAKING OFFICE HE SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DESIGNATING ME HIS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND TRADE. FOREIGN TRADE AND INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT IS IMPORTANT WORK ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE CALIFORNIA JOBS DEPENDS ON TRADE AND TOURISM. CALIFORNIA'S DEEP WATER PORTS ARE TOURIST ATTRACTIONS AND ARE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILE BORDER WITH MEXICO ARE AMONG THE BUSIEST IN THE COUNTRY. THIS YEAR WITH THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE HELPED TRAIN MORE SMALL BUSINESSES TO REACH FOREIGN MARKETS WITH THEIR PRODUCTS WE HAVE DELIVERED HUMANITARIAN AID TO HELP ASYLUM SEEKERS AND WE'VE INCREASED COOPERATION WITH MEXICO TO FINALLY MOVE FORWARD TO CLEAN UP THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY AND THE NEW RIVER. THAT. CALIFORNIA'S VOICE ON THE WORLD STAGE IS SO IMPORTANT. THE WORLD IS LOOKING TO WAX NOW MORE THAN EVER TO LEAD ON THE CLIMATE AGENDA. YOU ARE SO DEDICATED TO THIS WORK AND IT A TIME WHEN SOMEONE THIS COUNTRY VILIFY IMMIGRANTS THE WORLD LOOKS TO CALIFORNIA AS WE CELEBRATE DIVERSE CITY WE KNOW THAT OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY AN INNOVATIVE SOCIETY COMES HAND IN HAND WITH BEING THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION FOR IMMIGRANTS TO THE UNITED STATES NUMBER ONE. GOVERNOR NEWSOME OFTEN SENATE THE CALIFORNIA IS AMERICA'S COMING ATTRACTION GOVERNOR THE VISION THAT THE REST OF OUR COUNTRY WILL IT EVENTUALLY CATCH UP WITH CALIFORNIA IS ONE THAT OFFERS HOPE AND OPTIMISM TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES FAR AND WIDE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IT IS MY HONOR AND PRIVILEGE TO PRESENT TO YOU THE FORTY EIGHT GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA PLEASE STAND FOR GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM. THANK YOU. WE. THANK YOU ALL. I TENDED TO. MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT BEING LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. BUT DON'T DO IT ALL RIGHT I WILL MAKE ANY OF IT THANK YOU BUT ON THE DATA GOVERNOR FOR YOUR- YOUR INTRODUCTION AND THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- FOR WELCOMING JENNA MEET YOUR HOUSE NOT A PRO TEM MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE FELLOW CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR THE PRIVILEGE. OF THIS PODIUM. THIS NINE THIS IS WHERE GOVERNOR STAND BEFORE YOU AND REPORT WITH PRACTICED GRANDIOSITY THAT THE STATE OF OUR STATE IS STRONG AND GETTING STRONGER. AND LARGELY THAT IS STILL TRUE. AND YES A LANDING PROUDLY WE STILL ARE AMERICA'S COMING ATTRACTIONS. BY ANY STANDARD IN BY NEARLY EVERY RECOGNIZABLE METRIC THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT JUST THE RIDING. BUT IN MANY INSTANCES LEADING THE COUNTRY INVENTING THE FUTURE AND INSPIRING THE NATION. WE REMAIN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IN JOIN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT CONSECUTIVE MONTHS OF NET JOB. SOME THREE POINT FOUR MILLION JOBS HAVE BEEN CREATED SINCE THE GREAT RECESSION AND FOUR MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES CALL CALIFORNIA THEIR HOME. MORE THAN HALF MORE THAN HALF OF ALL U. S. VENTURE CAPITAL STILL FLOWS THE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES. AND WE'VE AVERAGED WE'VE AVERAGED THREE POINT 8% GDP GROWTH OVER FIVE YEARS AND I SAY THIS RESPECTFULLY COMPARE THAT TO THE TWO POINT 5% NATIONAL GDP GROWTH CALIFORNIA'S. THINK ABOUT THE STATE TODAY IT'S AN ENTERPRISING MODERNIZING PLURALIZED UNIONIZING NATION STATE OF OPPORTUNITY THIS. THIS THE UNDERSCORE THE POINT CONSIDER THAT ONE IN SEVEN NEW JOBS ONE IN SEVEN NEW AMERICAN JOBS ADDED TO OUR ECONOMY JUST SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN HAVE BEEN CREATED RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO RESPECTFULLY WHEN YOU HEAR THAT THE BOASTS THE BELIEVES THE TWEAKS OF WASHINGTON POLITICIANS TRIPPING OVER THEMSELVES TO TAKE CREDIT FOR THE ECONOMY REMEMBER THE REAL VIP'S OF AMERICANS GA GDP THAT'S THE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND INVESTORS AND ENTREPRENEURS OR ACTUALLY PRODUCING THEIR OWN CALIFORNIA DREAMS. WORKING TOGETHER WORKING TOGETHER WE BUILD RECORD RESERVES. INCLUDING THE LARGEST RAINY DAY FUND IN STATE HISTORY. W COULD SEE THAT THE HIGHEST CREDIT RATING IN NEARLY TWO DECADES AND WE DISAPPEAR THE INFAMOUS WALL OF DEBT FOLLOWING THE PRUDENT PRINCIPLE OF NEVER SPENDING MORE MONEY THAN WE TAKE IN. SIMPLY PUT. CALIFORNIA'S THE ROCKET FUEL PRIOR POWER IN AMERICA'S RESURGENCE THAT LET ME BE CLEAR. BEGAN UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. NEEDS TO BE SAID. NO WORRY I'M NOT GONNA GET MUCH MORE PARTISAN THAN. I SAID MUCH MORE PARTISAN. BUT EVEN SO EVEN SO CALIFORNIA NEVER STAND STILL NEVER REST ON ITS LAURELS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THIS IS THE SPEAKER SPARE LAST YEAR WE WORKED IN A START PARTNERSHIP TO ACHIEVE A STARK PROGRESS TOGETHER WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE MOST STUBBORN ISSUES INVOLVED WRITER FUTURES FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS CANNOT BE FULLY APPRECIATED HIS LINE ITEMS IN THE BUDGET OR BILL NUMBERS THAT ACROSS THE DESK WE SEE IN THE BASES OF DREAMERS AND DOERS ALL ACROSS OUR REMARKABLE STATE AND IN THE PATIENTS WHO HAVE NEW AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDED BY DOCTORS TO LOOK LIKE THAT BUT NO THEIR CULTURE SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR STORY. IN THE RESPOND HERS PUTTING BADGES ON UNIFORMS AND THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE KNOWING THAT NOW CALIFORNIA HAS THE BEST AND BEST RESOURCE WILDFIRE PROGRAMS. IN THE WORKING. IN THE WORKING PARENTS WITH MORE MONEY IN YOUR POCKET THANKS TO EXPAND IT PAID FAMILY LEAVE. THOUSAND DOLLAR FAMILY TAX BURDEN IN LOWER COSTS DUE TO TAX FREE DIAPERS AND TAMPONS. IN A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT IS PLANNING A MORE PROMISING FUTURE WITH TWO FREE YEARS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ANY THE COLLEGE ATHLETES WILL FINALLY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE JUSTLY COMPENSATED FOR THEIR OWN NAME. ONE AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S FINALLY GETTING ECONOMIC ATTENTION IT DESERVES AND COMMUNITIES FINALLY GETTING SAFE AND CLEAN DRINKING WATER NEIGHBORHOODS. NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ARE THAT ARE READING JUST A LITTLE BIT EASIER THANKS TO CALIFORNIA'S LANDMARK PARTNERSHIP WITH LEADING AUTOMAKERS. AND IF VOTERS APPROVE IT WE MAY SOON SEE MORE SCHOOL BUILDINGS NEWLY FREE OF LEAD AND TOXIC MOLD THANKS TO A BI PARTISAN STATE SCHOOL. IN CITY AFTER CITY HOUSEHOLD AFTER HOUSEHOLDS THE HARD WORK OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S MAKING DREAMS MORE REAL FOR MORE CALIFORNIANS THAN EVER BEFORE. YOU KNOW WHAT JUSTICE BRANDEIS WROTE IN NINETEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO THAT IS SINGLE COURAGEOUS STATE MAY SERVE AS A LABORATORY OF DEMOCRACY HE COULD EASILY HAVE BEEN REFERENCING CALIFORNIA TODAY. BUT BECAUSE UNLIKE WASHINGTON PLUTOCRACY CALIFORNIA'S AND SATISFIED SERVICING A POWERFUL FEW ON ONE SIDE OF THE VELVET ROPE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS FOR ALL. INTO THAT AND JUST THINK ABOUT THIS THERE ARE ONE POINT SIX MILLION FEWER CALIFORNIANS TODAY LIVING IN POVERTY THEN THERE WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN THAT'S ONE QUARTER OF THE NATION'S DECREASE. IN JUST THIS ALONE. NO MAN A PROGRESS LOW NO AMOUNT OF PROGRESS CAN CAMOUFLAGE THE MOST PERNICIOUS CRISIS THOUGH IN OUR MIDST. THAT'S THE ULTIMATE MANIFESTATION OF POVERTY HOMELESSNESS. THAT'S WHAT I'M DEVOTING TODAY'S REMARK TO THIS CRISIS. LET'S CALL IT WHAT IT IS IT'S A DISGRACE BUT THE RICHEST STATE IN THE RICHEST NATION SUCCEEDING ACROSS SO MANY SECTORS IS FALLING SO FAR BEHIND THE PROPERLY HOUSE HE'LL AND HUMANELY TREE SO MANY OF ITS OWN PEOPLE. EVERY DAY THE CALIFORNIA DREAM IS DETERMINED BY THE WRENCHING REALITY OF FAMILIES CHILDREN AND SENIORS LIVING ON FED ON A CONCRETE BED. MILITARY VETERANS WHO WHO WORE THE UNIFORM OF OUR COUNTRY IN A FOREIGN LAND ABANDONED HERE AT HOME. LGBTQ YOUTH FLEEING ABUSE AND REJECTION FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. FACES UP TO SPARE FAILED BY OUR COUNTRY'S LEADERS AND OUR NATION'S INSTITUTIONS. AS CALIFORNIA'S WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON OUR UNWAVERING SENSE OF COMPASSION AND JUSTICE FOR HUMANKIND BUT THERE'S NOTHING COMPASSIONATE ABOUT ALLOWING FELLOW CALIFORNIANS TO LIVE ON THE STREETS HUDDLED IN CARS OR MAKE SHIP IN CAN'T MIX. AND THERE'S NOTHING AND THERE'S NOTHING. THERE'S NOTHING JUST THERE'S NOTHING JUST AS WELL ABOUT SIDEWALKS AND STREET CORNERS THAT AREN'T SAFE AND CLEAN FOR EVERYBODY. THE PROBLEM IS PERSISTED FOR DECADES BECAUSE BY MASSIVE FAILURES IN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS INVESTMENT IN OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. EXACERBATED BY WIDENING INCOME INEQUALITY AND CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING SHORTAGE. THE HARD TRUTH IS FOR TOO LONG WE'VE IGNORE THIS PROBLEM. WE TURNED AWAY WHEN IT WASN'T OUR SISTER OR BROTHER OUR NEIGHBOR OR FRIEND AND WHEN IT WAS A LOVE ONE. HELP SO OFTEN WASN'T THERE. BUT MOST OF US EXPERIENCE ALMOST THIS IS A PANG OF GUILT. NOT A CALL TO ACTION. YOU KNOW BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN WE DID THAT FIRST POINT IN TIME COUNT. THERE WERE OVER ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE. WERE GEARED HOMELESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND. IN THAT FIRST POINT IN TIME CáC THAT'S THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND MORE. THAN WE HAVE TODAY. AND EVEN AT THAT PEAK THE STATE DID NOT TREAT THE ISSUE WITH THE URGENCY REQUIRED. SINCE THEN IT'S ALMOST BECOME NORMALIZED RIGHT CONCENTRATED OVER YEARS AND SKID ROWS AND TEN CITIES IN IN BIGURBAN CENTERS. BUT NOW. IT'S NO LONGER ISOLATED. BACK SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLING INCREASES OF OCCURRED IN RURAL AREAS AND SMALL TOWNS IN REMOTE PARTS OF OUR STATE. NO PLACE NO PLACE IS IMMUNE NO PERSON IS ON TOUCHED. IT TOO OFTEN KNOWING HE WANTS TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. I HAVEN'T HEARD LOCAL FISHING JUST RECENTLY COMPLIED RECLAIMED SAID LOUDLY NOW MY PROBLEM. SERVANTS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ARE TOO BUSY POINTING FINGERS THE STEP UP AND HELP THAT'S SHAMEFUL. AFTER ALL EVERY HOMELESS CALIFORNIA. IT IS. EVERYTHING WAS CALIFORNIA LIVING ON THE BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS IS A CASUALTY OF INSTITUTIONAL FAILURES PERSON IS FALLING THROUGH EVERY POSSIBLE HOLE IN THE SAFETY NET LOOK HOMELESSNESS IMPACTS EVERYONE BUT NOT EQUALLY. SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN MUCH MUCH MUCH HARDER. URBAN RENEWAL AND GENTRIFICATION BROKE UP COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND THROTTLE THEIR ABILITIES TO MOVE INTO THE MIDDLE CLASS THESE ARE SYSTEMIC ISSUES ROOTED IN POVERTY AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. BLACK CALIFORNIA. BLACK CALIFORNIA'S DEPRIVED 8% OF LA COUNTY POPULATION BUT 42% OF ITS ALMOST. A RECENT POLL FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE HALF ONE OF EVERY TO LATINOS IN THE STATE ARE AFRAID THAT THEY OR A FAMILY MEMBER COULD BECOME HOMELESS. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN NO LONGER TREAT HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING AND SECURITY AS SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM VERY BELOW AND OTHER PRIORITIES THAT ARE MUCH EASIER TO WIN. OR BETTER SUITED FOR SOUND BITES SO RESPONSIBILITY AND IT MUST BE THE TOP OF OUR AGENDA. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS. THE CRISIS WAS NOT CREATED OVERNIGHT. AND IT'S NOT GONNA BE SOLVED OVERNIGHT OR EVEN IN A YEAR. IT IS A STATE WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE NO CALIFORNIA IS HOMELESS WE GOT TO REPLACE CALIFORNIA'S SCATTERSHOT APPROACH WITH A MORE FOCUSED CRISIS LEVEL RESPONSE SO IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS MOMENT WITH A COMMITMENT IT DEMANDS WERE COMMITTED TO ADVANCING. A NEW FRIEND. NUMBER ONE. WE WILL REDUCE STREET HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY AND HUMANELY TO EMERGENCY ACTIONS WE WILL BE LASER FOCUSED ON GETTING THE MENTALLY ILL OUT OF TENTS IN INTO TREATMENT. WE WILL PROVIDE STABLE FUNDING TO GET SUSTAINABLE RESULTS. AND WE WILL TACKLE THE UNDER PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE WILL DO ALL OF THIS. DO ALL THIS WITH REAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND REAL CONSEQUENCES. LIST ALL THE BILL WE START WITH FIRST WE START WITH EMERGENCY ACTIONS TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN NOW TO MAKE AN IMMEDIATE TANGIBLE IMPACT AFTER DECADES OF NEGLECT AND INADEQUATE RESPONSES WE'RE PUTTING OUR ENTIRE STATE GOVERNMENT ON NOTICE TO RESPOND WITH URGENCY. LAST MONTH I ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THE POINT EMERGENCY HOUSING TRAILERS AND SERVICES FOR HOMELESS FAMILIES AND SENIORS THESE FIRST TRAILERS HAVE BEEN DEPLOYED IN OAKLAND. AND LA COUNTY. THE NEXT. THE NEXT GROUP OF TRAILERS I'M PLEASED ANNOUNCED TODAY ARE HEADED AS WE SPEAK TO SANTA CLARA RIVERSIDE CONTRA COSTA SO NO MY COUNTY AND THE CITY OF STOCK.% THAT SAME EXECUTIVE ORDER BUILT ON A WORK LAST YEAR TO IDENTIFY ALL EXCESS STATE LANDS. TODAY WE ARE MAKING TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX STATE PROPERTIES VACANT LOTS FAIR GROUNDS ARMORIES IN OTHER STATE BUILDINGS TO BE USED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR FREE FOR HOMELESS SOLUTION. WE ARE READY TO GO. A LADY. THIS NOW WE'VE ALSO DIRECTED CALTRANS TO MAKE BETTER USE OF OTHER ON OCCUPIED SPACES TO GET HOMELESS HOUSING UP AS FAST AS POSSIBLE THE WE HAVE GREAT EXAMPLES WE HAVE GREAT EXAMPLES UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN THAT SPACE ALREADY IN SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND SAN JOSE AND LOS ANGELES AND WERE ABLE TO MOVE FASTER THAN EVER. EVER BEFORE ON THESE LEASES IN THESE LAND TRANSFERS BECAUSE WE'VE ESTABLISHED A NEW STRIKE TEAM ACROSS AGENCIES AND STATE GOVERNMENT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CALTRANS SEEKS P. ALL WITH ONE GOAL AND THAT'S TO BREAK THROUGH BUREAUCRATIC THAT BARRIERS SO AS THE STATE MOVES FAST I ALSO HAVE TO MOVE TOGETHER WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES WERE BY DEFINITION CRITICAL ALLIES IN ADDRESSING THIS EMERGENCY. TWO MONTHS AGO WE ISSUED A ONE HUNDRED CHALLENGE TO OUR LOCAL PARTNERS THE FOCUS ON PART. POPULAR DRESS WITH INTERNET. DOZENS OF COMMUNITIES I'M PROUD TO SAY ACROSS THE STATE ARE STEPPING UP BUT AS WE CAN THESE A MERCY WE ALSO HAVE TO LIMIT ALL THESE ROADBLOCKS TO HOUSING AND SHELTER LAST YEAR BECAUSE YOUR LEADERSHIP I WAS VERY PROUD TO SIGN TO IMPORTANT BILLS ONE STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR NAVIGATION CENTERS STATE WHY. AND THE SECOND EXEMPTED ALL SHELTERS AND HOMELESS HOUSING FROM ENVIRONMENTAL ROOM ROOM REVIEW AND I'M MOST POPULOUS CITY LOS ANGELES. THIS THIS YEAR I HOPE THAT WE CAN EXPAND BY WORKING TOGETHER TO EXPAND THIS LAW AND EXTENDED TO ALL HOMELESS SHELTERS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING WOW. WE NEED MORE MORE DELAY. ALSO PUSHING FOR NEW MODELS OF HOMELESS HOUSING LIKE HOTEL MOTEL CONVERSIONS AND PRE FAB AND TINY HOMES. AND AS WE DO THAT WILL CUT THE RED TAPE TO GET TO YES ON THESE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES. WELL WE TAKE EMERGENCY MEASURES TO INCREASE SHELTER AND SERVICES WE MUST ALSO COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSED THE HARDEST PART OF THIS PROBLEM. THAT'S THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS. THE FOLKS OUT IN THE STREETS AND SIDEWALKS FOR OVER A YEAR. WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES. FOR CENTURIES THE DEFAULT TREATMENT WAS CONFINEMENT IN A SILENCE WHERE PEOPLE DETERIORATED OUT OF SIGHT. IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES ARE OUR NATION BEGAN THE TREND TOWARDS DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION WAS NOT A SINGLE POLICY. IT WAS A SERIES OF POLICIES. OUTRAGE OVER CONDITIONS IN INSTITUTIONS AS WELL AS THE CREATION OF NEW MEDICATIONS LIKE FOR ISN'T THAT THE- HELP TREAT THE MENTALLY ILL AND IT SPARKED A MOVEMENT TO. TREAT PEOPLE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN LOCKING THEM AWAY. CALIFORNIA PASSED THE SHORT ACT IN FIFTY SEVEN TO FUND COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PUSH. THIS WHERE THE CALLS FOR AS WELL. PRESIDENT KENNEDY ENVISION A SYSTEM IN WHICH IN HIS WORDS THE RELIANCE ON THE COLD MERCY OF CUSTODIAL ISOLATION WILL SUBLIMATE WOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED HE SAID WILL BE SUPPLEMENT. BY THE OPEN WARM OPEN ONE OF COMMUNITY CONCERN. STATE MENTAL HOSPITALS WERE CLOSED BUT THE PROMISE OF COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH IS NEVER FULLY REALIZED. STATES WOULD BURDEN NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY BUT PROVIDED LITTLE IN THE WAY OF SUPPORT LAWS WERE CHANGED TO MAKE IT HARDER TO COMPEL MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AS WELL. THEN GOVERNOR RONALD REAGAN SIGNED THE LETTERMAN PETRA SHORT ACTING NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN DESIGNED TO END THE INAPPROPRIATE LIFETIME COMMITMENT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND CRITICALLY OFTEN FORGOTTEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE THE U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISION O'CONNOR VERSUS DONALD RULED THAT MENTAL ILLNESS ALONE COULD NOT JUSTIFY A STATE BLOCKING A PERSON UP AGAINST HIS WILL. ALL OF THESE CHANGES COINCIDED WITH SAFETY NET CUTS BLOCK GRANTS AND TIGHTEN THE ELEVATOR ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES AND NINETEEN NINETIES ALONG WITH THE WHOLESALE RAZING OF SKID ROW'S AN SR ROSE WHICH FOR SO MANY WAS THE ONLY HOUSING OPTION THEY CAN AFFORD. THE CUBAN OF IMPACT. MAKE COUNTY JAILS THE DE FACTO MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS. PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE LEFT WITH IN ADEQUATE OPTIONS TO GET THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE THEY NEED. IN A POLITICALLY POLARIZED WORLD. LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES BLAME ONE ANOTHER FOR THESE FAILURES. HISTORICALLY SPEAKING BOTH ARE RIGHT IT'S TIME TO STOP POINTING FINGERS AND JOIN HANDS IN A TRANSFORMATIONAL SOLUTION. LET'S NOT. LET'S TALK ABOUT. THIS YEAR WE HAVE PROPOSED CALLING IT'S A ONCE IN A LIFETIME REFORM OF OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE OBVIOUS LONG IGNORED PRINCIPLE THAT PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BRAIN HEALTH ARE INEXTRICABLY LINKED AFTER ALL. AFTER. TEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS TEN MILLION CALIFORNIA'S ONE IN FOUR SUFFER FROM SOME TYPE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITION. THIS IS NOT A NARROW ISSUE. NOR A NEW ONE. THE DEEPER TRUTH IS THAT OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THOUGH IT'S BEEN DECIDED TREAT SOME OF OUR PARTS NOT THE SUM OF OUR PARTS IN THAT MUST CHANGE. SLAM PROPOSAL. THIS LANDMARK PROPOSAL CALLS FOR LEVERAGING MEDI CAL AS A TOOL TO HELP CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS THE HOMELESS OUR CHILDREN AND PEOPLE CYCLING IN AND OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IT'S ABOUT INTEGRATING CARE TARGETING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND EXPANDING OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS. STATEWIDE. HEALTHCARE. HEALTHCARE AND HOUSING CAN NO LONGER BE DIVORCED AFTER ALL WHAT'S MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO A PERSON'S WELL BEING THEN A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD. DOCTORS DOCTORS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WRITE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOUSING THE SAME WAY THEY DO FOR INSULIN AND ANTIBIOTICS. ONE THAT'S NOW THAT'S THE AIM OF CALLING TRANSFORMING OUR MEDICAL SYSTEM AS WE KNOW IT AND WE BACKED IT UP WITH THE SIX HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET REQUEST TO MAKE IT REAL THIS YEAR. NOW. COURSE ALL OF THIS YOU KNOW. ALL THIS ALLIES IN HINGES ON AN INDIVIDUAL BEING CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING HELP TO GET OFF THE STREETS AND INTO TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE SOME AS WE KNOW TRAGICALLY OR NOT THAT'S WHY WE NEED BETTER LEGAL TOLLS ONES THAT ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT HELP PROVIDERS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TO MORE EFFECTIVELY HELP PEOPLE ACCESS TREATMENT THEY NEED. CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AHEAD OF THEIR TIME. BUT TODAY THEY CALL OPERATE FOR. WE MUST TAYLOR THESE POLICIES TO REFLECT THE REALITIES OF STREET HOMELESSNESS TO DATE WHICH IS SO DIFFERENT IT WAS FIFTY YEARS AGO OR EVEN FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WHEN THESE LAWS WERE ENACTED. AND WHILE WE MADE PROGRESS UNLIMITED AND GENERAL CONSERVATORSHIP LAST YEAR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ARE WARRANTED. ALL WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF DEEP RESPECT ALWAYS FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PERSONAL FREEDOMS BUT WITH AN EQUAL EMPHASIS ON HELPING PEOPLE IN THE LIFESAVING TREATMENT THEY NEED AT THE PRECISE MOMENT. THEY NEED IT. WELL CLEARLY IT IS TIME TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS EXPERTS WHO AGREE THAT THRESHOLD FOR CONSERVATORSHIP ARE TOO HIGH AND NEED TO BE REVISITED. TAKE LAURA'S LAW WHICH ALLOWS LOVE ONCE AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ASK COURTS TO COMPEL THOSE WHO NEED TREATMENT IN A COMMUNITY BASED OUTPATIENT CARE THE PROBLEM IS IT'S TOO HARD TO USE. WE NEED TO REMOVE SOME OF THE CONDITIONS IMPOSED ON THE COUNTIES TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A LOT SO THEY CAN EXPAND WHO BENEFITS. IT WOULD HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP WE NEED AUTHORIZED COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO ESTABLISH THESE PROGRAMS LIKE THE ONE THAT WAS RECENTLY DEVELOPED IN SAN FRANCISCO LOOK. AT SAID. NOT NAIVE ABOUT THIS THAT SAID. WE KNOW THAT THE MOST URGENT ISSUE IS NO THE LEGAL INABILITY TO CONSERVE PEOPLE BUT THE ON AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND CARE FOR THOSE WHO MOST NEED. I RECOGNIZE POLICIES AN EMPTY PROMISE WITHOUT CREATING MORE PLACEMENTS. AND ONE CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS. IS BY REFORMING PROPOSITION SIXTY THREE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT. IT'S ALL PLEASE STAND UP. AS WRITTEN AS WRITTEN IT'S RESOURCES OFTEN DON'T REACH THE PEOPLE NEED IT THE MOST. NOT WHEN UP OPPOSING CHANGING THE FUNDING FORMULA FOR HOW MUCH EACH COUNTY GETS RATHER REFORM MUST FOCUS THE FUNDING ON STREET HOMELESSNESS AT RISK AND FOSTER YOUTH AND THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WE NEED TO EXPAND THE KINDS OF SERVICES IT CAN PAY FOR SPECIFICALLY ADDICTION TREATMENT. WE ALSO NEED TO STOP RESPECT WE NEED TO STOP TOLERATING OPEN DRUG USE ON OUR STREETS. DISTILLING WE SHOULD THE BELL COUNTIES TO SPEND MORE OF WHAT THEY'VE GOT BY LOWERING THE 33% RESERVE THRESHOLD THAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO HOLD BACK. THIS. THIS IS INTERESTING. EVEN WITH THE CURRENT RUSSELL FORTY OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE ABOVE THAT LINE THAT'S OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS ON SPENT THAT COULD GO TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND IN THE TREATMENT SO MY MESSAGE THIS SPEND YOUR MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS BY JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR OR WILL MAKE SURE THOSE DOLLARS GET SPENT. FORTY. YOU GUYS GET IT IT'S ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. MATCHING RESOURCES TO RESULTS FOR TOO LONG THERE WERE NO REQUIREMENTS FOR PROGRESS HIGHER SYSTEMS BEEN VOLUNTARY. I WANT TO THANK MY COUNSEL HOMELESS ADVISORS FOR BRINGING CONSEQUENCES TO THE FOREFRONT OF THIS DISCUSSION. IT'S TIME TO MATCH OUR BIG HEARTED EMPATHY WITH TIGHT FISTED ACCOUNTABILITY. IN JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE YOUR LEADERSHIP THE LAST TWO YEARS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT'S BEEN ALLOCATED TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALL HOMES. NOW THIS INCLUDES SIX HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION- MERCY ON THE STATE THAT YOU RECENTLY APPROVED. AND UP UNTIL NOW. STATE EIGHT IS BEEN BLOCK GRANTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY FORMULA. SPENDING DECISIONS HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY UNRESTRICTED IN LOCALLY DRIVEN BUT RESPECTFULLY. THE PROBLEMS GOT WORSE. AND THE RESULTS NAY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THIS MOMENT HE CRIES OUT FOR A NEW APPROACH IN THE BUDGET I JUST SUBMITTED I PROPOSED A NEW APPROACH A NEW CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO HOUSING FUND IN WITH IT A WHOLE NEW WAY OF INVESTING IN HOMELESS SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE A CLEAR PURPOSE FOR THE SPOT PAINFUL WHAT WORKS GAP FINANCING FOR INNOVATIVE HOUSING MODELS LIKE HOTEL MOTEL CONVERSIONS AND SECURING MAKE IT UNITS WHEREVER WE CAN FIND STABILIZING IN EXPANDING BOARDING CARE HOMES IN PREVENTNG HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE RENT SUBSIDIES AND RAPID RE HOUSING TO HELP PEOPLE ONE JOB LOSS ONE. AWAY FROM. WITH THIS NATION'S FIRST STATEWIDE HOUSING FUND WE CAN START BRADY TOGETHER STATE AND PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS AS WELL AS HEALTH CARE MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES PAIN FOR HOUSING BUT NOT OVERHEAD BY CAPPING THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THE FUNDS AT JUST TEN PERCENT. THAT'S IMPORTANT. THE WHOLE IDEA IS TO BE NIMBLE AND FLEXIBLE INTO A BALL FROM BEST PRACTICES TO NEXT PRACTICES. AND ALWAYS WITH AN AYE AND DEEP REGIONAL COORDINATION AND CLEAR METRICS NUMBER OF NEW LEASES SIGN NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING UNITS CONVERTED OR BUILT NUMBER OF PEOPLE STABILIZE WITH RENT SUBSIDIES NUMBER OF PEOPLE MOVED OFF THE STREETS. AGAIN STANDING. TO GET US STARTED I'M ASKING THIS LEGISLATURE TO INVEST AN UNPRECEDENTED SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GET THIS ONE UP AND RUNNING BASED ON THE SEVERITY OF CRISIS WE NEED EARLY LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO SET UP THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THE CONTRACTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS NOW AND THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU NOT TO WAIT MONTHS. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE MONTHS. THE PUBLIC LAST PATIENTS I KNOW YOU'VE LOST PATIENCE I'VE LOST PATIENCE IN ORDER TO REVERSE DECADES OF NEGLECT. IN ORDER TO TURN THINGS AROUND THOUGH. THE CRISIS THIS DEEP ROOTED ALSO GONNA NEED MORE THAN JUST ONE TIME FUNDING. WE'RE GONNA NEED SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABLE REVENUE. I KNOW THIS IS ALWAYS THE TOUGHEST THING SO IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS LOOK I'M WORKING I PLEDGE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU CLOSELY TO IDENTIFY WHERE THIS ONGOING REVENUE WILL COME FROM BUT WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT. TO PROVIDE SAFER CLEANER STREETS COMMUNITIES THAT WE REPRESENT DESERVE IT'S TIME TO MUSTER THE POLITICAL WILL TO MEET THIS MOMENT. PEOPLE CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW THIS ARE DEMANDING BOLD PERMANENT SOLUTIONS ANYTHING LESS IS NOT GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE. IN ORDER TO- GET THE JOB DONE WE GOT A MATCH THIS NEW. MONEY WITH A NEW LEGAL OBLIGATION TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS HAD ON REQUIRE. REQUIRING WATER AND THAT ANY NEW FUNDING ISN'T REPLACING EXISTING SPENDING BUT CREATING NEW SOLUTIONS. SOME HAVE RECOMMENDED A LEGAL RIGHT TO SHOP. I KNOW IT'S A PROVOCATIVE IDEA WHICH IS FORCE THE STATE TO EXPLORE THE LIMITS OF WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN BE COMPELLED TO DO. BUT RIGHT NOW. I BELIEVE MUST BE ABOUT BRINGING GOVERNMENTS TOGETHER AS WORKING PARTNERS NOT SPARRING PARTNERS IN A COURT OF LAW. SO INSTEAD. SO INSTEAD WE ARE PROPOSING STRICT ACCOUNTABILITY COMPREHENSIVE AUDITS IN A DO IT OR LOSE IT POLICY TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESULTS TAKE ACTION. ARE YOU GONNA LOSE THE NEW FUND. IN ORDER TO TRACK THE PROGRESS WE'RE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AND ESTABLISHING A UNIFIED HOMELESSNESS DATA SYSTEM TO CAPTURE ACCURATE LOCAL INFORMATION BECAUSE OF THE END OF THE DAY ALL KNOW THIS YOU CAN'T MANAGE WHAT YOU DON'T MEASURE. IT IS TIME IT'S TIME FOR THE FAILED POLICY OF NOT MY PROBLEM TO BE REPLACED WITH ONE A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS EVERY SECTOR IN EVERY COMMUNITY. NOW LOOK I'M NOT NAIVE NOT ONE CITY NOW ONE COUNTY NOT EVEN ONE STATE CAN SHOULDER THIS RESPONSIBILITY ALONE THIS IS A NATIONAL CRISIS. FEDERAL DECISION MAKING CONTRIBUTED TO THIS MOMENT. IN OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO MATCH ITS RHETORIC WAS SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTIVE AND DELIVERABLE RESULTS. CALIFORNIA HAS. I'LL REPEAT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND IT SANTA PARTNERSHIP TO WASHINGTON SEEKING TO JOINTLY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE HONESTLY THIS PARTNERSHIP SHOULD BE A GIFT. BUT ANTI WORDS AND SYMBOLIC GESTURES ONE MASK A 15% ACROSS THE BOARD CUT TO HUD'S BUDGET. I'M OLD ENOUGH MANY YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM AS WELL. I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN HUD WAS IN THE HOUSING BUSINESS AND I'M HOPEFUL ONE DAY THEY WILL BE AGAIN. YEAH HAVE TO ROLL YOU KNOW AFTER ALL HOMELESSNESS IS IN A BLUE OR RED ISSUE AND EVERYONE IS A BLIGHT ON THE SOUL. OF AMERICA. THE COURSE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK OF CALIFORNIA SOLUTION. HAS TO BE MORE HOUSING A COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSE. YOUR JUST SIMPLY NOT THE BILL ENOUGH. YOU KNOW WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING FOR PEOPLE AT ALL INCOME LEVELS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE MAY WORSEN THE HOMELESS CRISIS IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE. AND WE ONLY. THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE WAY OUT OF IT IS TO MASSIVELY INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LET'S MOVE ON HOMELESSNESS WITH OUR COURAGE ON HOUSING SUPPLY LOOK LAST YEAR WE MADE A NEW AN HISTORIC INVESTMENT ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO BOOST PRODUCTION WAS PART OF THE SEVEN PLUS BILLION DOLLARS YOU ALL APPROVED ON AFFORDABLE HOUSE WE SECURED NEW JUDICIAL PRIORITIES AGAINST CITIES THAT DON'T ZONE PLAN AND YOU KNOW DO THEIR FAIR SHARE. YEAH HAVE. WE PROTECT TENANTS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. FINALLY OUTLINE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PEOPLE THAT HAVE HOUSING VOUCHERS. WE CREATED. WE CREATED A PERMANENT FUND TO PROVIDE LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO AT RISK TENANTS. IT IS TOTALLY WE WORK TOGETHER TO CRACK DOWN ON RENT SPIKES IN ON JUST A BIG SHINS PASSING THE NATION'S STRONGEST STATEWIDE RENTER PROTECTIONS. I WAS A BIG. THANKS TO YOUR LEADERSHIP LAST YEAR I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SIGN EIGHTEEN BILLS TO BOOST HOUSING PRODUCTION. BUT TIME AND TIME AGAIN EAGER BOULDER REFORM HASN'T HAPPENED IF THE CARD IN PART. LEGITIMATELY APART BECAUSE OF CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT MAKE BELIEVE AND MANY OF OUR LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS UNDERSTANDABLY WORRY ABOUT BEING PUSHED OUT OF THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF GENTRIFICATION. MIDDLE CLASS HOMEOWNERS THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR SINGLE FAMILY HOME LOSING ITS VALUE TO SCARY PROSPECT GIVEN THE HOUSE IS OFTEN THE FAMILY'S BIGGEST ASSET THOSE ARE REAL CONCERNS AND THEY SHOUL NOT BE BRUSHED ASIDE. AT THE SAME TIME. WE ALSO KNOW THE STATUS QUO IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE WE'RE NOT BUILDING ANOTHER HOUSE AND- LOOK AT I GET CITIES NEED TO MEET THEIR HOUSING GOALS IN A WAY THAT MATCHES THEIR COMMUNITY. BUT DOING NOTHING IS NO LONGER AN OPTION. LOOK I RESPECT LOCAL CONTROL BUT NOT AT THE COST OF CREATING TO CALIFORNIA CLASS SYSTEM NOT AT THE COST OF IMPERILING THE CALIFORNIA DREAM AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE GOT A GROUP COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE CAN LIVE WORK DRIVE SPENDING MORE TIME WITH THEIR FAMILIES LESS TIME IN TRAFFIC. NINE THIS MEANS. THIS MEANS A COMMITMENT RIGHT NOW THIS YEAR THE MAJOR REFORM THAT WILL ELIMINATE RED TAPE AND DELAYS FOR BUILDING CRITICALLY NEEDED HOUSING LIKE AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY HOMES A SPECIALLY NEAR TRANSIT IN DOWNTOWN. I'M COMMITTED COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEADERS OF BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY TO CRAFT AND PASS THESE NEEDED REFORMS OBJECTIVES ARE CLEAR. INCREASED DENSITY IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES EQUITY AFFORDABILITY AND INCLUSION. INCREASED CERTAINTY.
