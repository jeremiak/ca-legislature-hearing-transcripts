WELCOME THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY APPROACH TO THE WORK. AND VISION FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. TO EXPLAIN MY APPROACH I BEGIN WITH TECHNOLOGY MY RICH IMMIGRANT HERITAGE WHICH IS GROUNDED IN LOVE STRUGGLE AND HARD WORK. I AM FORTUNATE TO HAVE MY PARENTS VIçT AMINATA I'M AWAY WITH ME TODAY. THEY INSTILLED IN ME A PROFOUND APPRECIATION AND VALUE FOR HARD WORK THROUGH THEIR TIRELESS EXAMPLE I ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE MY WIFE KELLY AND MY DAUGHTER MAYA WEDDING COURAGE ME TO ASSUME THIS ENDEAVOR OF PUBLIC SERVICE. DALY THEY MAKE A PRECIOUS SACRIFICE SO THAT I MAY INVEST COUNTLESS HOURS TO PERFORM THE JOB CALIFORNIA DESERVES. I ALSO DRAW STRENGTH FROM MY SISTERS BROTHERS AND NEPHEWS WHOSE INSPIRING EXAMPLES OF THE TERM SHIN AND ADVOCACY GIVE ME HOPE TO PURSUE A WORLD THAT IS NOT YET SEEN THESE PERSONAL. BRIEFLY BUT INTENTIONALLY BECAUSE AS A DESCENDANT OF A BUT I SEVERAL WORKER AND RIGHTEOUS FLAVORS I AM A BENEFICIARY OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT THIS COUNTRY AND STATE DECLARE. CALIFORNIA COMMITS TO WORKERS AND LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS THAT IF THEY INVEST THEIR TIME BODY AND MIND IN OUR ECONOMIES THEY SHALL DO SO UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND IF THOSE CONDITIONS ARE NOT MET. CALIFORNIA WILL DEFEND THEIR BASIC RIGHT. ORIGINS OF THIS CONTRACT WAS GROUNDED IN ME BY WITNESS SEE MY FATHER WORKS THREE JOBS AND MY MOTHER TO JOBS TO PROVIDE FOR OUR FAMILY. I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN CHECKS BOUNCE WAGES ARE STOLEN RETALIATION OCCURS OR YOU EXPERIENCE AN UNINSURED EMPLOYER PEOPLE ARE TRAUMATIZED FAMILIES ARE DEVASTATED. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE IS A FIRST RESPONDER TO THESE TRAGIC REALITY. THESE CASES FILED WITH MY OFFICE YOU NOT ONLY REPRESENT LEGAL DISPUTES BUT A VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA SOCIAL CONTRACT THAT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. NOW IS CALIFORNIANS FACED AN UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC ECONOMIC DEVASTATION AND A MOVEMENT THAT HAS FORCED US TO RECKON WITH IN THIS REGIONAL RACES. THAT SOCIAL CONTRACT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN. FOR TWENTY YEARS THIS AGENCY WAS MY BIGGEST PARTNER I LED A FIGHT TO ELIMINATE UNFAIR COMPETITION IN THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY I LEARNED THAT EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT CANNOT BE ACHIEVED BY WORKERS A LOAN OR A SINGLE EMPLOYER. ALL STAKEHOLDERS WORKERS EMPLOYERS INDUSTRY LEADERS COMMUNITY GROUPS AND GOVERNMENT NEED TO BE ENGAGED TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE COMPLIANCE. SUCCESSFUL ENFORCEMENT HAS THREE COMPONENTS PROACTIVE EDUCATION TIMELY ENGAGEMENT AND CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF LAW. COMPONENTS MUST BE BUILT IN OUR REGULAR OPERATIONS SO THAT EVERY ENFORCEMENT UP HOLD CALIFORNIA SOCIAL CONTRACT FOR BOTH WORKERS AND LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS WHO ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR ECONOMY. AS LABOR COMMISSIONER EACH DAY I'M WORK TO UPHOLD THE SOCIAL CONTRACT FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORK AND IT'S EMPLOYERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK WE WILL SEE IF MS BATES WOULD LIKE TO START SENATOR ARE YOU THERE. I AM WELCOME GOOD TO SEE YOU. AGAIN TO BE HERE AT LEAST A ON THE OF THIS GREAT ANYWAY I WISH I COULD BE THERE IN PERSON BUT- BOB LET ME START WITH THE CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. GARCIA FOR THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT APPOINTMENTS AND OUR- IDEA FIRST AND FOREMOST ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC. REPRESENTATION VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND SHE TOLD YOUR PASSION FOR THE NEW JOB YOU'RE YOU'RE TAKING ON A ACTUALLY BEEN OUT AND ABOUT A YEAR I'M LOOKING OUT THOUGH THE RIGHT NUMBERS HERE. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN MY DISTRICT SO LET ME ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS ON THOSE IT HAS TO DO NUMBER ONE WITH THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR LOW. IN THE RIGHT. YEAH ON WELL ACTION AFTER AND STARTING WITH THE FIVE A QUICK QUESTION THERE HAS BEEN COULD. OVER THE BILL TO BUSINESS OUR- AND WHETHER THOSE ARE. ARE CERTAINLY AFFECTED BY EIGHTY FIVE AND I THINK THAT CHAMBER IT HAPPENED. THEY ALSO BOTH OF THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATORS LEGISLATURE TO TAKE A LOOK AT GOALS ARE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME CLARITY SO. HOW IS YOUR OFFICE CURRENTLY VIEWING THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS. ARE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S BETWEEN TWO SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP PROPRIETORSHIPS. THANK YOU SENATOR. AB FIVE IS A VERY- IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND AS A NEW PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE ARE EVALUATING IT CAREFULLY- WE ARE OUR JOB IS TO ENFORCE THE LAW. AND WE ARE APPLYING THAT STATUTE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT. OUR OFFICE IT CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST YOU- ANTI ADMINISTRATION TO EVALUATE PROVIDE YOU WITH PUBLICLY AVAILABLE IN FOR ME AND ASK ABOUT YOU EIGHT. REFORMS THAT YOU MAY BE CONSIDERED. THANK YOU FOR THAT BUT I THINK GOING FORWARD I'M GOING TO ASK IF YOU WANT TO A GOT A LITTLE MORE TIME AND I'LL CLEAR IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE SOLD OUT. THERE'S CONSISTENCY IN THE APPLICATION OF AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE THERE'S SOME CONFUSION AND UNCERTAINTY CERTAINLY SO. JUST ASK ANY AND YOU'RE GOING FORWARD ON YOUR TO DO LIST IF YOU'LL TAKE ANOTHER LITTLE LONGER HARDER LOOK AT BECAUSE WE CAN SHOW YOU TO GET A RESPONSE FROM OUR IN REMEMBER SANTA. YEAH IT WILL MAKE TO AN ATTORNEY HARM KIND OF IN TAKE ON IT SO I THINK SOMETHING THAT'S MORE ABSOLUTE IN HOW YOU APPROACH IT AS VERY STRONG GUIDANCE LET'S SAY WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL ON THE- THE CARGO LAWSUITS CERTAINLY DURING THE COLD BEARD WE KNOW THAT OUR BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN REALLY REALLY CHALLENGED IN BEATING. ALL LABOR LAWS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU- ISSUES COME FORWARD IN OPERATE AS AN ESSENTIAL OR NON ESSENTIAL BUSINESS. SO I'M WILL BE NATURAL WE'RE THINKING IN THE LABOR DEPARTMENT ABOUT SOME REFORMS THAT MIGHT BE AYE NISHIDA. AT LEAST ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND CERTAINLY GOING FORWARD. THAT WE HAVE ON YOU GIVING EMPLOYER SOME OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. VIOLATIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY DURING COLD BEEN UNINTENTIONAL ARE WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT ON THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR AND BEFORE I GO TO THE POP THE QUESTION LET ME ADD I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE ARE CONSISTENT IN OUR APPLICATION OF LAW. AND WE HAVE WORKED IN COORDINATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT EMPLOYERS GET ONE ANSWER FROM THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES SO I WOULD REFER YOUR CONSTITUENTS TO OUR AB FIVE PORTAL. AND MY TEAM CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM BEST UNDERSTAND THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT TATUTE AND WE'LL HAVE BEEN PART OF THE OUTRAGE THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH COLIN WE HAVE AN YEAR. JEAN EVERY CALIFORNIAN OUTREACH CAMPAIGN AND ONE OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THAT OUTREACH CAMPAIGN IS TO BUILD A BUSINESS. EACH BROWN. WE HAVE TO A MUCH JOB OF THE- EMPLOYERS NOT ONLY IN RESPECTS THE DEFENSE OF ALLEGATIONS BEING MADE AGAINST THEM BUT TO HELP THEM UNDER. THAT WE- FOR RESPONSE BUSINESS IT IS OUR STATUTORY OBLIGATION TO ELIMINATE UNFAIR COMPETITION SO WE WANT TO BE A RESOURCE FOR THEM AS THEY STRUGGLE WITH THESE REALITIES I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR US TO SAY HERE'S THE LONG NOW FOLLOW WITH. I STRUGGLED WITH EMPLOYERS JANITORIAL INDUSTRY FOR TWENTY YEARS IT TAKES SOME TIME IT TAKES SME UNDERSTANDING SOME ADJUSTMENTS TRY DIFFERENT WAYS TO SEE GIVEN THE ROLE OF THE COMPANY WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO AND PART OF OUR- BUSINESS ENGAGE. THIS SO WITH LOVE TO FOLLOW WITH OUR OFFICE SINCE IF WE COULD DO A WEBER ARE FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE BETTER HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OBLIGATIONS ARE UNDER EIGHTY FIVE. WELL WHAT. ABOUT THAT'S WONDERFUL THE HEARING NANO GOING OUT AND YOU NEED INTERACTION THAT APPRECIATE THAT- CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY. AND I APOLOGIZE SENATOR WOULD YOU REMIND ME YOUR QUESTION ON WHICH RESPECTS TO POPULAR. IT IS WHETHER OF THEIRS REFORMS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE RIGHT NOW FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED THOSE BUSINESS THOSE CHALLENGED WITH YOU KNOW THE ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN ON AGAIN NOW CENTRAL OR NONESSENTIAL. OUR RESPONSE IN THESE- WITH A POTENTIAL FOR- YOU KNOW UNINTENTIONAL. ARE VIOLATING OR BEING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LABOR LAUNDRY CHALLENGE. THERE CAN BE ABA THE VIEWS THAT THE WOULD TO BE ABLE TO. WRAPPED WITHOUT HAVING SOME SORT OF FINE OR ACTION TAKEN AGAINST THEM I GUESS THE WOULD BE SAYING. A WHICH HOW. THANK YOU ARE WOULD BE THERE SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE HELD RESPONSIBLE DURING THIS PARTICULAR TIME IF THEY WERE TO REMEDIATE IMMEDIATELY WHATEVER THE VIOLATION OB. ACTUALLY OCCUR. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR RESTATING THAT QUESTION- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO MORE WHEN IT COMES TO PAGA AND IN HOW WE ENGAGE EMPLOYERS I HAD MET THE ADMINISTRATION- LATE LAST YEAR AND EVALUATED THE NEEDS TO HAVE INFORMATION ON ALL SPECIFICALLY FOR EMPLOYER HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICE IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY HIGH. YOUR POINT THE OPTION. WORK THAT AVAILABLE THEM- SO WE THAT WE HAVE BEEN DELAYED IN EXECUTING THAT PLAN BUT THAT IS- REFORM THAT I PLAN TO IMPLEMENT AND I'M OPEN TO HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND FROM YOUR OFFICE OF ALL OTHER REFORMS THAT WE SHOULD. WHEN IT COMES TO THE LETTER OF THE LAW WE ARE RESPONSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THAT LETTER- AS A LOT AS REGION SO BUT AGAIN OUR TEAM IS AVAILABLE WE DO HAVE A- UNIT OF THE TROOPS WHO HAVE SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE- IN. EVALUATING THE POPPY CASES- AND THEY CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE TO BE A PARTNER AS YOU EVALUATE ANY REFORM. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT THAT'S GOOD NEWS AND GOING FORWARD OUR OFFICE WILL BE VERY.

OKAY GREAT AGAIN THANKS FOR ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT I GET A LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION. THANK YOU SENATOR WELLS THANK YOU SENATE ON AND- THANK YOU A- MAN PRO TEM IN- I JUST WANT ALSO OFFER MY- GRADUATIONS TO YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN IN AND THANKS FOR A DEDICATED CAREER OF SERVICE- WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AT THE CALIFORNIA TRAINING FACILITY IN SOLID AT A FEW YEARS AGO AND I. HE IS TO REMEMBERING THAT IN. IN THE TOUR THAT I WAS PROVIDED WHEN I VISITED THERE. I ALSO WANT TO FOLLOW UP WE HAD A GOOD CONVERSATION YESTERDAY AND SOME OF THE CONTRABAND ISSUES RAISED BY SENATOR BATES COVERT NINETEEN. YOU DID GO THROUGH A VERY SPECIFIC AND DETAILED REPORTING BY INSTITUTION DURING OUR CONVERSATION. I DIDN'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING THIS MORNING OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. BUT I HAVE READ SOME REPORTS OF SOME IN MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT GUARDS NOT WEARING MASKS EVEN THOUGH THAT IS THE PROTOCOL IN THE MORNING IF YOU COULD MAYBE JUST COMMENT ON. IS THERE ANY CONSEQUENCE OF GUARDS WERE STAFF DON'T WEAR MASKS WHAT WHAT ARE THE RULES AND REGULATIONS AND HOW IS SOMETHING LIKE THAT BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION THIS IN IN. HAVE A WAY TO BRING THAT TO THE ATTENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION. DOUBLE L. INCIDENT AS- WE HAVE WE HAVE TODAY THIS MORNING I THINK THAT WAS A FOURTH MEMO THAT WAS ISSUED RELATIVE TO THE MANDATORY WEARING OF MASS. WE HAVE OUR CAPTAINS OUT DOING A WEEKLY TOUR- UNDER OUR DIRECTORS LEADER IF WE PUT TOGETHER CAPTAIN'S CHECK LISTEN TO OUR- AND THEY GO. AND THE WARDENS ARE OUT WEEKLY WALK AROUND IT'S FACT ENTIRE MANAGING TEAMS OUT AND PACIFIC WE WILL LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE FOLLOWING. THOSE COLD AT NINETEEN PROTECTIONS AND THE MAIN THING IS ASS IF SOMEONE IS NOT WEARING A MASK AND IS JUST A SLIP OF SOMETHING THAT'S ONE THING BUT IF SOMEONE IS RECALCITRANT AND SAYS THAT THERE ARE OR WHERE MASTER. IT'S JUST TOO HOT. PERSON WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY YOU KNOW THE HIRING PARTY WHICH IS A WOOD WORKING AT YOUR PRESENT. AND IF SOMEONE WAS IS IF AN INMATE OR A FAMILY MEMBER WAS A SENSE SOMETHING OR ANY BY WAS AND THAT TO ME. EMAIL WHICH I GET A LOT OF EMAILS FROM FAMILY MEMBERS DIFFERENT THINGS AND OF COURSE I WOULD REFER THAT BACK TO THE ARE WITH THE REWARDS. AND HAVE THAT PERSON LOOK INTO THAT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY LEGITIMACY. LEGITIMACY TO WHAT'S BEING SAID. WE APPRECIATE THAT WE DID TALK SOME ABOUT WITH THE SUSPENSION. OF FAMILY VISIT SIR GUEST VISITS TO INMATES AS PART OF THE CODE. NINETEEN PROTOCOL YOU SHARED SOME OF THE EXPANDED. TELEPHONIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR INMATES TO CONNECT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS- SO THE BIGGEST.% SUSCEPTIBILITY I WOULD GUESS IS STAFF COMING IN AND OUT WHO WERE. NOT CONTAINED IN THAT INSTITUTION THEY'RE GOING HOME TO FAMILIES AND- OUT IN THE COMMUNITY SO. APPS THE GREATEST RISK IN THESE INSTITUTIONS FOR. VIRUS BEING BROUGHT IN IS EITHER IN MAKE TRANSFER OR STAFF IN GUARD SO JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE- CONSEQUENCE SINCE IT IS REQUIRED FOR GUARDS AND STAFF TO WEAR MASKS. IN A FULL WAS BROUGHT HERE ATTENTION- WARDEN'S ATTENTION FORGET FOR A BUT MORE ACTIVE FINANCE. WOULD THERE BE A DISCIPLINARY ACTION ASSOCIATED WITH WITH PERSISTENT RECALCITRANCE ON THE MASK REQUIREMENTS. YES THERE WOULD BE WITHIN OUR EMPLOYED THIS PRINTER PROCESS A PERSONAL THE FIRST OFFENSE TO BE WRITTEN ON A EMPLOYEE COUNTING BROWN ALL PERSON DID IT AGAIN WE WRITE THEM A LETTER OF INSTRUCTION AND A SOMEBODY WAS REALLY JUST OBSTINATE RECALCITRANT AND THAT WILL BE REFERRED FOR ADVERSE ACTION. AN OLD WHERE SOMEONE COULD. CERTAIN CHANNELS HE'S PUT UPON THEM MONETARILY THAT. WOULD AFFECT THEM. ONE THING THAT WE DO WITH OUR STAFF IS WE DOA LOT OF EDUCATION WAS STAFF AND THE OFFENDER POPULATION. ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHY THE NEED TO WEAR THE MASK. WE PROVIDE PEOPLE MASS WE ALLOW STAFF TO WEAR MASKS THAT ARE YOU KNOW APPROPRIATE FOR THE WORKPLACE THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH. AND SO I LEAST I'M NOT AND MY TO PRESERVE MY MISSION- THE WARDENS AND IMAGINE TEAMS ABOUT OUT I'VE TOURED THE PRISONERS I'VE SEEN PEOPLE IN MASS. AVENUE COMPLAINTS IS FROM MY NEW PRISONS OF THAT BUT YES THERE WILL PEOPLE WILL BE. IMAGINE IF IN A IT'S BEEN FOR MEMEL BUT OUT ON THE SERIOUSNESS. AND THE MANDATE THAT STAFF AND THAT- YA EXTENDERS WERE MASS TO. HELP PREVENT IT PANDEMIC ONE THING I DID MENTION I AM NOT SURE WE TALK ABOUT A COUPLE DAYS AGO IS THAT WE CHECK EVERY PERSON THAT COMES ON GROUNDS EVERY DAY NO MATTER CONTRACTOR DELIVERING FOOD WHATEVER IT IS WE ASK THEM THE QUESTIONS FOR STREET. AND WE ALSO CHECK THAT PERSON'S TEMPERATURE IF SOMEONE SAYS YES TO ONE OF THE SCREENING RIGHT REPORTER TEMPERATURES ABOVE A HUNDRED POINTS FOR. AN EFFORT TO TURN AROUND AND THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THE INSTITUTION. THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF NATURE OF HOUSE DO YOU NOT OR HAVE ANY. THIS ORDER. GEN FOR STAFF OT A MASS I BELIEVE ONE OF OUR MISSIONS I'VE WHEN I FEAR IS OTHERS I THINK BEEN A LETTER OF INSTRUCTION ISSUED AND I THINK I'M PRESENT THERE MAY BE- SOMEONE PENDING ADVERSE ACTION AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE FACE THE PROBLEM. GENERAL PUBLIC OF COURSE BUT IN WORK PLACES I AM PARTICULARLY IN AN INSTITUTION HOLDING. THE PEOPLE CAPTIVE TO PAY FOR THEIR CRIMES- THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WIGGLE ROOM IN IN SOCIAL DISTANCING IS EVEN MORE CHALLENGING I THINK IF WORD IS OUT THAT THERE IS A CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT WEARING A MASK- THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST MECHANISM TO ENFORCE. SOME IT'S CLOSE 2100% COMPLIANCE AS WE CAN GET BUT AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CANDOR IN YOUR ANSWERS AND AGAIN APPRECIATE YOUR- YEARS OF SERVICE AND- LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN SOME DAY SOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
