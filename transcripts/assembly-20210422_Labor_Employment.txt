THE BILL THAT WOULD REQUIRE MEDIATION. THE FIRST STEP IN EMPLOYEE SMALL EMPLOYER DISAGREEMENTS ON PAID FOR BY MICHAEL. I'M PAID FAMILY LEAVE.

THANK YOU UNPAID UNPAID FAMILY LEAVE SAVING TIME FOR QUICKER RESOLUTION AND MONEY ON COSTLY LITIGATION LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE BY SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE EXPANDED THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT IT NOW APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WITH JUST FIVE OR MRE EMPLOYEES. DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT COSTLY LITIGATION IN SMALL BUSINESSES ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THE MANDATE IN THAT EFFORT THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISHED THE SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY LEAVE MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM IN BUDGET BILL AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY SEVEN. AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN WE'RE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING CHARGES BEEN FILED FOR A VIOLATION OF CFRA AGAINST EMPLOYER WITH FIVE TO NINETEEN EMPLOYEES THE EMPLOYEE OR EMPLOYER WOULD NEED TO REQUEST MEDIATION WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF RECEIVING A COPY OF THE RIGHT TO SUE NOTICE. THE CURRENT PROBLEM IS THAT EMPLOYERS DO NOT RECEIVE A COPY OF THE RIGHT TO SUE NOTICES UNTIL AFTER LAWSUIT HAS BEEN FILED. UNDERMINING THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM THIS FAILURE OF THE EMPLOYER TO RECEIVE THE LETTERS FOR GOOD REASON. THE EMPLOYEE MAY DECIDE NOT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON FILING A LAWSUIT AND DOESN'T WANT THE EMPLOYER TO KNOW THAT THEY ALMOST FILED A LAWSUIT. AB TEN THIRTY THREE CORRECT THIS ISSUE. BY HAVING THE EMPLOYEE CONTACT THE F. PH IS MEDIATION PROGRAM IF THEY DECIDE THEY DO WANT TO PROCEED WITH A LAWSUIT. AND THEN D. F. E. H. WILL CONTACT THE EMPLOYER TO RANGE THE MEDIATION WITHIN THE NEXT SIXTY DAYS. IF BOTH PARTIES AGREE MEDIATION WOULD BE FRUITLESS THEY NEED NOT PARTICIPATE. SECONDLY THE BILL ALSO CLARIFIES THAT EDUCATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MEDIATION UNDER THE PROGRAM BUT WAS NOT. THE EMPLOYER CAN ASK TO STAY THE PENDING ACTION GO THROUGH MEDIATION.

WHEN SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE WAS BEING DISCUSSED TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY RIGHTS ACT THE SMALL BUSINESSES THERE WERE SOME CONCERNED ABOUT THE EFFECT THE POTENTIAL LITIGATION ON THE SMALL BUSINESSES. AND THEY LEARN TO IMPLEMENT C. FOR A WHICH COMES WITH QUITE LENGTHY AND COMPLEX REGULATIONS. AND AGREEMENT THEREFORE WAS MADE TO ESTABLISH A NOVEL SMALL EMPLOYER FAMILY NEEDS MEDIATION PILOT PROGRAM THROUGH THE D. S. B. H. UNDER THAT PROGRAM AT THE C. FOR RELATED COMPLAINT WAS FILED AGAINST THE SMALL BUSINESS WITH FEWER THAN TWENTY EMPLOYEES EITHER PARTY COULD REQUESTED THE PARTIES FIRST MEDIATE THAT. WE GET THE CLAIM HERE THAT THE FAA. BEFORE A LAWSUIT CAN BE FILED. AT THAT PROGRAM DOES SEVEN TEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AT THE ISSUE AS STATED WITH THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IS THAT YOU REQUEST MEDIATION. AND A THIRTY DAYS OF RECEIVING A COPY OF THE RIGHT. YOU KNOW THAT HOWEVER. IN EMPLOYER. ACTUALLY RIGHT. THEREFORE I'M SORRY BACK POLICIES- AND IF SO IF SOMEONE BECAUSE IN A WHERE DOES NOT ACTUALLY A COPY OF THE RIGHT TO DO NOT A THEY ARE A TO UTILIZE THE PRO YOUR THEY DON'T ACTUALLY SEE A COP OF THE RIGHT TO DO NOT AND TELL THE- USUALLY IT'S NOT EVEN A TO THE CA AND AN EMPLOYER DOES NEXT GET IT TELL.

A NEW COMPLEX SET OF REGULATIONS AND HOW TO PROPERLY ADMINISTER TRACK AND DOCUMENT THAT LEAVES.

MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THE SUMMER GONZALEZ I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS TODAY I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE VERBIAGE THAT IS BEING USED TO MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE WORKED ON INTRODUCED MAYBE I'M NOT READING IT CORRECTLY BUT IT APPEARS THAT IT IT. FORCES MEDIATION AND EVERY STANDPOINT WHEN MY UNDERSTANDING THE DEAL THAT WE MADE IT WAS THAT THE- EMPLOYER COULD REQUEST MEDIATION BUT THE LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL REALLY DOES PUT PEOPLE IN A BIND WHERE THE- EMPLOYER DOES NOT WANT TO- ENGAGE IN MEDIATION FOR WHATEVER REASON MAYBE THEY WENT THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO THEIR- TO THEIR MALE MAYBE. THEY'RE THEY'RE JERKS AND ARE JUST LIKE I DON'T CARE SEE IN COURT RIGHT BUT I THINK IT'S IT MIGHT BE A DISTINCTION WITHOUT A DIFFERENCE FOR MOST CASES RIGHT WOULD GO TO MEDIATION BUT IT IT SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED MEDIATION IT IS UPON US THE REQUEST OF THE EMPLOYER. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. I THINK THERE'S- WERE EMPLOYER I THINK WHAT WE THAT THE MEDIATION. HAS TO BE ALLOWED UPON REQUEST OF THE EMPLOYER BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED PER OUR DISCUSSIONS AT LEAST MEDIATION ITSELF WAS NOT REQUIRED BEFORE FILING A LAWSUIT THE EMPLOYER JUST HAD TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO SEEK MEDIATION BEFORE A LAWSUIT WAS FILED. SO I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M FULLY GRASPING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT I. THINK IT'S- I MEAN I THINK AND I THINK MAYBE. YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A YEAR AN HOUR ANYTHING THIS LAST SPRING THAT WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS MAYBE THAT'S PART OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS- I THINK MY- RECOLLECTION WAS WE WANT TO BE EMPLOYEE TO BE ABLE TO SEEK MEDIATION AS WELL WHICH IS PART OF IT I WAS ASKING YOU AYE. SO AND WE WANT TO MEDIATION BE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH COSTLY LITIGATION I WANTED TO GET THEIR RIGHT TO EXERCISE I WOULD HOPE THAT THE EMPLOYEE WOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT AS WELL WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO EXPRESS I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S- PART OF WHAT YOU'RE GETTING THAT'S WHY AND I TO GET IN TROUBLE WITH GIVING. HE RIGHT TO THEM PLATE AND OR THE EMPLOYER YOUR ALWAYS THE RIGHT EXIST WITH EITHER PARTY HOWEVER I THINK IN A PLANE WE NEED THE TEXAS SUGGEST THAT MEDIATION IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BEFORE- A LAWSUIT WHEN IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T ADDRESS A POINT WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE AN EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE NEITHER OF WHOM WANT MEDIATION. OKAY NOW I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE SAYING THANK YOU MEXICO EVERYBODY SO- WE TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT I DO REALLY WANT TO THINK I DON'T KNOW SEALERS LISTENING BUT I DO REALLY WANT TO THANK THEM FOR PARTNERING ON THIS AND WORKING REALLY HARD TO GET USTO LANGUAGE THAT GOT US TO WHERE I THINK WE WERE LAST YEAR AGAIN THEY WERE. HUGE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL LAST YEAR. AND THAT'S PART OF WHY WE PUT THE TIMELINE GOING TO I MAY MY REMARKS ONE OF THE WITH GIVING EMPLOYERS RIGHT IS THEY DON'T GET THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER WHICH OF COURSE FOR GOOD. WE DON'T TO FLIRT WHAT HAPPENED. RETALIATED FOR THAT RIGHT TO SUE LETTER AND SO WE GOOD REASON NAME- DOESN'T KNOW THAT THIS IS COMING THE CEREMONY REGULATED THAT LETTER WANT TO KEEP IT WAY SOME THE FAA AS BEEN REALLY ABOUT NINE BROUGH AT. AND SO HOW DO WE WORK OUT A SYSTEM WHERE THE EMPLOYER GET THAT ARE. IN A MEETING FOR WAY- WITHOUT GETTING A LETTER THAT WAS SORT OF THE CA. WE WERE STOPPED AND SO WE DID HERE PERSONALLY IS AND THE PARTIES CAN AGREE IMMEDIATELY THAT IT'S GOING TO BE FOR LESS THAN OF A GRAVE AND NOBODY GOES TO MEDIATION THE OTHER THING IS. FOR SOMEONE WHO'S NOT RESPONDING- THERE'S A SIXTY DAY WINDOW IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN SIXTY DAYS YOU GET THE RIGHT TO SUE SO THOSE WERE WHAT WE CAME UP WITH C. LEAD TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO WE'RE NOT DELAYING THE LITIGATION WHERE MEDIATION IS FRUITLESS. OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SO WE DID TRY TO WORK THAT OUT I DID NOT TWICE. LIES NOW. NEUTRAL ON THE- IS BECAUSE THEY- FELT LIKE WE- HAD FOUND. WAY TO. POP GET A PATH TO THEIR- WHERE IT'S- BUT ALSO PROVIDE. MEETING FROM. I'VE BOTH PARTY. BUT I WOULD LOVE. TO TALK FOR. IF YOU THINK. WE HAVEN'T. THAT CORRECTLY. YOU COULD JUST FEEL IT WHEN I READ IT. IT IT SEEMS. A BIT CONFUSING ON. THE REQUIREMENT. OF MEDIATION. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY I. AM VERY TRUSTING OF. THE GOOD STAFF. THAT IT'S- GOING TO GO TO. IN I THINK THEY WILL HEAR MY CONCERNS NOW AND IF I'M WRONG THEY WILL LET YOU KNOW. SO YOU REALLY GOT- YEAH IT'S- NO I DON'T HAVE A- HONOR AWARD WAS- SUCH. OKAY THIS A SECOND FROM SOME MEMBERS STONE ANY OTHER QUESTION COMMENT. YES PLEASE OVER THE SUMMER CENTER. WELL I THOUGHT THE STONER RT SECOND.

AND SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY GO AHEAD AND- MAKE YOUR WAY UP TO THE TO THE TABLE HERE WE HAVE AB. SEVEN NINETY FOUR- WHICH IS A DO PASS TO TRANSPORTATION RECOMMENDATION AND WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT TO YOU AB SEVEN NINE FOUR THE CLIMATE JOBS IN EQUITY ACT A MEASURE THAT WILL TRANSFORM CLEAN VEHICLE INCENTIVES. INTO A TRUE ENGINE FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND GROWTH OF HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR DISADVANTAGED WORKERS BY ENSURING THE PUT THAT PUBLIC FUNDING TO MANUFACTURE AND PURCHASE CLEANER VEHICLES IS TIED TO LABOR STANDARDS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. AND OUR PARTNERS ON THIS ISSUE I WILL BE MAKING AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE TRUCKING ASSOCIATION BUT LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS CLAIMING INVESTMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL TO CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMIC. LIMA CHANGE IN ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE STRATEGIES AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE COVER NINETEEN DOWNTURN IN THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMB AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. HAVE MADE THESE INVESTMENTS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT- THROUGH ECONOMIC EQUITY AND CLIMATE TOOLS. THIS BILL INCORPORATES HIGH ROAD WORK FOR STANDARDS AND TO CALIFORNIA'S NEW CLEAN VEHICLE INCENTIVE DOLLARS. THESE STANDARDS WILL LEVERAGE HIGH ROAD JOBS FOR DISADVANTAGED AND DISLOCATED WORKERS. AND VEHICLE MANUFACTURING BATTERY PRODUCTION AND TRUCK DRIVING. WORKFORCE STANDARDS GUARANTEE THAT OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS DELIVER EQUITY TO STRUGGLING CALIFORNIA WORKERS. AND US CALIFORNIA JOBS. IN THE CVV TRANSITION THIS IS BECAUSE STANDARD SOME PUBLIC DOLLARS INCENTIVIZE COMPANIES TO PERFORM AT THEIR BEST DELIVER HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR EMISSIONS THE AUTO INDUSTRY IS A CORNERSTONE. OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURING JOBS EMPLOYEE NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA AND ONE MILLION PEOPLE NATIONWIDE. BUT JOB QUALITY IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY OFF SHORING RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY WORKERS. ATTACKS ON WORKERS FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION AND WEEKEND HEALTH AND SAFETY ENFORCEMENT. AND WHEN ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION WAGES FOR PRODUCTION WORKERS AN AUTO ASSEMBLY AND AUTO PARTS OF DECLINED. BY OVER 20% IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. THIS IS WHY GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO AUTO COMPANIES NEED TO INCENTIVIZE HIGH QUALITY JOBS THAT ARE BASED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN LOS ANGELES PORT TRUCK DRIVERS PARK DRIVE PORT DRIVERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR MOVING ALMOST HALF OF THE NATION'S CONTAINER IMPORTS. OUT OF THE ALLEY PORTS IN CALIFORNIA HAS OTHER ACTIVE PORTS. WITH MAJOR TRUCKING OPERATIONS AS WELL- TRUCKING AND SHORT HAUL TRUCKING GENERALLY ARE HOME TO A GREGIS MATH CLASSIFICATION OF CONTRACTORS BY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL CORPORATIONS BETWEEN SEVENTY TO NINETY PERCENT. OF DRAYAGE TRUCK DRIVERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED MAKING THIS THE DOMINANT BUSINESS MODEL IN THE INDUSTRY. POLICIES AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO UPGRADE FLEETS WITHOUT LABOR STANDARDS PUNISH ARE HARD WORKING DRIVERS AND ENTRENCH MISS CLASSIFICATION. USA TODAY CALLED CONDITIONS OF THE LOS ANGELES AND LONG BEACH PORTS MODERN DAY INDENTURED SERVITUDE. AFTER THE FIRST CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM AND OFTEN TRUCK DRIVERS ARE NEGATIVE PAYCHECKS BECAUSE THE COMPANIES CHARGE MORE FOR THE TRUCK RENTAL THAN DRIVERS EARN. IN THEIR INCOME. WORK FOR STANDARDS CAN BEGIN TO SHIFT THE BUSINESS MODEL AND TRUCKING FROM EXTREME WORKER EXPLOITATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL NON COMPLIANCE TO HIERO JOBS IN CLEAN VEHICLES THAT DON'T POLLUTE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. LIKE MINE AS SUCH AB SEVEN NINE FOUR CREATE THE PATHWAY TO ENSURE THAT PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN VEHICLE MANUFACTURERS AND FLEETS. PER SERVING GROW HIGH QUALITY US IN CALIFORNIA JOBS INTO AUTO MANUFACTURING BY. TYING BY TYING WORK FOR STANDARDS TWO INCENTIVE. DOLLARS THERE IS A LOT OF REALLY GREAT POSITIVE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH THIS BILL UNAVAILABLE TO TESTIFY ARE SHINGLES MAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND- SOME APPEL REPRESENTING THE BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE FONG. EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO MUCH- SO A TEST PLANS PORT EACH WITNESSES WITNESSES UP TO MINUTES- SO WE HAVE- BUT SHANE. SHANE GUSMAN SAM APPEL- SO WHOEVER'S READY SENATOR READY YOU MAY BEGIN- RIGHT AWAY. YOU MISTER. MISTER SHE MEMBERS DUST ON BEHALF OF THE CAN TEAM PUB AFFAIRS. IN SUPPORT AND PROUD TO CO SPONSOR THIS MEASURE. FOR DECADES THE GROUP SUPPORTING THIS BILL HAVE BEEN WORKING SEPARATELY ON SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER PROTECTION POLICIES. IN THE MORE RECENT PAST MANY OF US. HAVE COME TOGETHER TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN ACHIEVE SOME OF OUR GOALS THROUGH COLLABORATION. SB SEVEN NINETY FOUR IS A PRODUCT OF THAT COLLABORATION. THE IDEA HERE IS VERY IS A VERY SIMPLE ONE. HOW CAN WE ACHIEVE MULTIPLE BENEFITS FROM EVERY DOLLAR THE STATE SPENDS. IN OTHER WORDS LET'S MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE PUBLIC'S MONEY TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD ON POLICIES CALIFORNIA HAS ALREADY PRIORITIZED IN THIS INSTANCE TACKLING CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENSURING THAT THE JOBS CREATED. IN ADDRESSING THAT WORLDWIDE CONCERN ARE GOOD ONES. FOR THE TEAMSTERS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE JOBS WORKING WITH CLEANER VEHICLES ARE IN TRACKING. WE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE BIGGEST LABOR PROBLEM THE INDUSTRY FACES THAT'S NICE CLASSIFICATION AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD. THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD COUNTLESS HORROR STORIES ALREADY ABOUT MISS CLASSIFICATION WITH NO WORKER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED TO THESE DRIVERS. NO HEALTHCARE NO BENEFITS NO TIME OFF NO SICK LEAVE AND THE LIST GOES ON AND ON. THE OTHER THING THAT MANY DON'T REALIZE IS THAT. CLASSIFIED DRIVERS ARE FORCED TO DECLARE. THAT THEY ARE IN BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES REQUIRING THE PURCHASE OR LEASE OF A VERY EXPENSIVE TRUCK. BEARING ALL OF THE COST GAS LEASE PAYMENTS INSURANCE ETCETERA- MANY MANY MONTHS THE COST OF THE TRUCK IS MORE THAN THE DRIVER MADE IN THE RATES THEY RECEIVED RATES BY THE WAY THAT THEY HAVE NO POWER TO NEGOTIATE. HOW CAN A MISCLASSIFIED DRIVER IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES STANCES ADEQUATELY COMPLY WITH COSTLY ENVIRONMENTAL UPGRADES FOR THE PERSON. YEAH. AND I WHEN PORT WE HAD TERRIBLE COME NUMBERS WITH THE ORIGINAL SUBSIDIES THAT CARBON OTHER AGENCY SPENT. WE CAN DO BETTER WE KNOW THAT COMPANIES WHO ARE BETTER CAPITALIZE AND WILLING TO MAKE THE EFFORT TO PROVIDE HIGH WILL JOBS WILL ALSO MAKE THE EFFORT TO SPEND CLIMATE MONEY APPROPRIATELY AND GET US TO OUR CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE GOALS FASTER. SB NINETY FOUR ACCOMPLISHES THIS BY ENSURING THAT THOSE WHO TAKE THE PUBLIC'S MONEY ARE NOT SCOFFLAWS AND ARE WILLING TO MAKE THE WORKER STANDARD COMMITMENTS GOING FORWARD. WE THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH UP NEXT SAM A PELLET YOU ARE ON THE LINE FEEL FREE TO BEGIN. AND YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HAVE A TIME YOU'D. S.

THANK GOD WE HAVE NO FOR THE OPPOSITION QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE DO ALREADY HAVE A MOTION. FROM A SUMMER GONZALEZ SECONDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LORD. THERE'S NO OTHER FOR THE QUESTIONS WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR I THINK THIS IS THE EXAMPLE OF ME TALK ABOUT- LABOR COMING TOGETHER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL- COMMUNITIES TO HELP ADVANCE- BOTH OBJECTIVES OF HIGH QUALITY JOBS AND CLEANING UP OUR ENVIRONMENT I THINK THAT- YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD- BUT WITH THIS ONE AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU BUY FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS DO PASSED. THE TRANSPORTATION AND- BEFORE WE GO OFF TO THE VOTE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AYE AYE MISTER CHAIR I HAVE A LOT TO SAY ON THIS BILL BUT I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS SHORT- THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE NEED LONG TERM EQUITABLE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO BUILD BACK BETTER. MAYBE SEVEN NINETY FOR THE CLEAN JOBS AND EQUITY ACTUAL HOW TO DO THIS WITH TWO ICONIC AMERICAN INDUSTRIES TRUCK DRIVING AND AUTO MANUFACTURING. I HAVE ASKED THAT MEMBERS HAVE ASKED ME AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT OUR PRIORITIES WILL IS THAT THE LABOR BILL IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BILL. IT'S BOTH MMHM WE CAN DO BOTH AND THAT IS THE MANDATE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. AND THOSE ARE THE PILLARS OF THE GREEN NEW DEAL IN WHICH CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY LEADING ON. SO IF WE TRULY BELIEVE IN A JUST TRANSITION WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT WE ARE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT TO ACTUALLY BE A REALITY AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN IDOL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM SECRETARY FROM CALL THE ROLL. SB SEVEN NINETY FOUR PLEASE. MOTION IS DUE PATH TO TRANSPORTATION KALRA I KALRA HI FLORA. FLORA NO GONZALEZ HI GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES. SAWYER HI STONE. JOHN I SEE I DON'T KNOW. ZERO NO BOARD. WARD HI. ALL RIGHT SO THE BILLS ON THE TO TRANSFER- SO ITEM BY ITEM. DECEMBER YOU HAVE OF SEVENTEEN YOU MAY BE BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU I'M PROUD 2% MISTER CHAN MEMBERS ELEVEN AB ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE WHICH CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING PARENTS AND MOTHERS TO RETURN TO WORK BY CREATING BACK OF CHILD CARE AT THE DIRECT BENEFIT. FOR EMPLOYEES WHO WORK AT COMPANIES WITH MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND STATEWIDE EMPLOYEES THE AVERAGE PARENT MISSES ABOUT EIGHT DAYS OF WORK PER YEAR DUE TO CHILDCARE BREAKDOWNS AND FOR SINGLE MOTHERS WITH CLOSE TO SIXTEEN DAYS. THIS IS DEVASTATING FOR LOWER INCOME EARNERS AND MISCHIEF'S AND WAGES OFTEN LEAD TO MISS RENT AND JOB LOSS THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXPOSED MANY CALIFORNIANS TO UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC INSTABILITY BUT MANY WOMEN PARTICULARLY AMERICAN INDIAN BLACK LATINO AND PACIFIC ISLANDER WOMEN WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO JUGGLE THEIR THEIR CHILD CARE. AND WORK RESPONSIBILITIES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC EVEN SO THE COVER NINETEEN RECESSION WAS THE FIRST RECESSION IN WHICH MORE WOMEN THAN MEN LOST THEIR JOBS AND BLACK AND LATINO WOMEN AND IMMIGRANT WOMEN. LOST THEM AT ESPECIALLY HIGH RATES THIS YEAR ALONE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WOMEN LEFT THE WORK FORCE DUE TO CHILDCARE ISSUES NOW NEARLY ONE YEAR INTO THE COAL BUT NINETEEN RECESSION MANY WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA FACE HARSH REALITIES AS THEY SCRAMBLE TO PAY FOR EVERYDAY EXPENSES. AFTER LOSING THEIR JOBS AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOMES MOTHERS HAVE TO SERVE BOTH AS CARE GIVERS AND PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF THEIR FAMILIES LOW INCOME FAMILIES SPEND ABOUT A THIRD OF THEIR INCOME ON CHILD CARE WHILE ALSO TRYING TO BALANCE OTHER FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES. MOTHERS HAVE MOTHERS NOW HAVE EVEN FEWER AFFORDABLE OPTIONS FOR CHILD CARE POTENTIALLY DELAYING THEIR RE ENTRY INTO THE WORKFORCE AS CALIFORNIA STRUGGLES TO RECOVER FROM THE CROWN OF I RESPECT PANDEMIC. WORKING MOTHER SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FACE IMPOSSIBLE CHOICES EACH MONTH ABOUT WHETHER TO PAY FOR THEIR FOOD THEIR RENT OR CHILDCARE AB ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE INSURERS WORKING PARENTS CAN CONTINUE EARNING THEIR WAGES. WHY THEIR CHILDREN SAFELY BEING CARED FOR. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ONE SINGLE MOMS ARE EMPLOYED BY A COMPANY THAT OFFERS BACK UP LIKELY. TO BE EMPLOYED TWO YEARS LATER. IT IS WHY INCREASING ACCESS TO CHILD CARE IS ESSENTIAL TO KEEPING WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE INCLUDING SUCH BENEFITS WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA COMPANY STRONGER. AND MORE COMPETITIVE WHILE ENSURING WORKING MOTHERS ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND IN OUR ECONOMIC RECOVERY TO BUILD BACK BETTER WE MUST PROVIDE CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED AND FINALLY PAY WOMEN FOR THE UNCOMPENSATED LABOR THEY PROVIDE FOR OUR ECONOMY. I AM COGNISANT OF THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS AND INTEND TO WORK.

AT ASHLEY HOFFMAN WHO WILL BE TESTIFYING BY PHONE IN OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY PURE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE AS A JOB KILLER. THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ABSOLUTELY SHARE THE CONCERN THAT THE COULD BE NINETEEN AND DEMOCRATS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON WOMEN IN LARGE PART DUE TO CLOSURES OF SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTRES WE SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF CHILD CARE FOR WORKING FAMILIES. THE ISSUE HERE IS WHO SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR BACKUP CHILD CARE WERE REGULAR CARE PROVIDER CANNOT BE UTILIZED EMPLOYERS MUST ALREADY PROVIDE LEAVE FOR SITUATIONS OR SCHOOL OR CHILDCARE CENTERS CLOSED UNDER EXISTING LABOR CODE PROVISIONS. SOCIALLY DURING THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC EMPLOYERS HAVE REALLY BECOME THE STATE UNIT OF CALIFORNIA AND THE MANDATE TO CONTINUE TO GET PILED ON HAVE BECOME UNTENABLE WELL MANY BRUSH AWAY ANY NEW BURDENS THAT ARE PLACED ON LARGE BUSINESSES MANY ARE STARTING TO HIT THEIR BREAKING POINT WHERE THEY MUST CONSIDER WHETHER THEY CANNOT TO AFFORD TO EXPAND IN CALIFORNIA. WHETHER THEY NEED TO CLOSE FACILITIES TO BE ABLE TO FINANCIALLY SURVIVE HERE THE BILL ALSO APPLIES TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS LIKE CITIES WHO ARE ALSO FINANCIALLY STRUGGLING AT THIS TIME. OUR POSITION IS THAT IF THERE'S GOING TO BE A SUBSIDY FOR BACKUP CHILDCARE REALLY SHOULD COME FROM THE STATE PROVIDING THOSE BENEFITS ARE USING FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO HELP EMPLOYERS COVER THE COST OF SUCH A PROGRAM. CALIFORNIANS RECEIVED FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT COULD BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND IS PRESENTLY ENJOYING A CONSIDERABLE SURPLUS THAT ALSO COULD BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. SPEAKING TO PROVISIONS IN THE BILL SPECIFICALLY. WE HAD OUR MEMBERS HAVE CONCERNS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL PASSED SECTION TWO NINE FIVE THREE D. PROVIDES AN EMPLOYER MAY NOT REQUIRE AN EMPLOYEE TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION VERIFYING THE USE OF THEIR FIRST SIXTY HOURS IT APPEARS THE SECTION MAY PROHIBIT AN EMPLOYER FROM REQUESTING DOCUMENTATION TO CONFIRM AN EMPLOYEE IS INDEED USING THAT FOR BACK UP CHILDCARE- AND NOT FOR PRIMARY CHILD CARE. WE HAVE REQUESTED CLARIFICATION ON THIS POINT BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT TO DATE- THERE'S ALSO NO CAP ON HOW MUCH MONEY AN EMPLOYEE CAN MAKE- TO BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF ATTORNEY MAKING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO OUR. COOPER WOULD BE ENTITLED TO THIS BENEFIT IT. OTHER AND HOW THE BAY. AGES I'M IN THE LINE. WELL ONCE. SAYS THE BENEFIT WOULD BE PAID AT MINIMUM WAGE. THERE'S ANOTHER SECTION THAT HAS A- SIMILAR PAYCHECK LEAVE. THEREFORE IN THAT STRUCK. AND TO MAKE MORE MONEY WITH ACTUAL GET MORE. FOR CHILD CARE. MONEY RATHER THAN THE MAKING WILL WAGES TO HAVE A- MY- OUR DATA TOURNEY AND- SAMPLE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO MORE. ONEY FOR BACK UP CHILDCARE ATTENDED MINISTRY WHO PLAYED THE SAME FOR MAKING CLASS. FOR THOSE REASONS AND MORE WE DO OPPOSE AB ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE AFTERSHOCK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE HERE- IT THE ROOM AND THEY. ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE. IF NOT THEN GO OVER THE PHONES AND IS THERE ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES. IN OPPOSITION AB ELEVEN SEVEN NINE. GIVE IT SHARE IF YOU'RE NOT THE VISION OF AB. ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN. ONE AND THEN ZERO IN OPPOSITION OF A LOT SEVENTY. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE FORTY YEAR LOW IS OPEN. SHARE MEMBERS YELLING GET THEM WITH THE L. SPACE THIS THIS ISSUE AND- THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN OCTOBER TO LYING OF SEVENTY YEAR AS THOUGH. HELLO AGAIN THE CAL MAY AFFECT A TECH ASSOCIATION WHERE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE WILL GO TO LINE OF. TWENTY NINE CHINA'S OPEN. GOOD MORNING- MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS IS BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO FOR THE OPPOSITION IN Q. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR MOTIONS. ON A. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE. THE SERVER'S DATA WELL THANK YOU MISS CARILLO FOR- YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT A CHILD CARE BECAUSE THE BIG THE BIG ISSUE ESPECIALLY IN A COMMUNITIES AS YOU SPOKE ABOUT THAT ARE- NOT STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY AND- AND IT. UP IT OVERLY IMPACTS SOME ARE MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND- THE FOLKS THERE. MY QUESTION IS WHY. YOU KNOW L. IS WE KIND OF BERMAN MORE AND MORE ON TO THESE CORPORATIONS COMPANIES THAT SET FOR THE EMPLOYERS OF THESE. WHY ISN'T THERE A CEILING ON ON WHO GETS THIS BENEFIT BECAUSE- THAT COST- ISN'T NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT HIGHER WAGE EMPLOYEES- NEED TO HELP OFFSET AND IT SEEMS LIKE. A LIKE A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS WE DEVELOP- IT'S- A LOT OF MONEY IS GOING TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED IT WELL THE PEOPLE THAT DO NEED IT DON'T GET ENOUGH. AND THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT WE KEEP MAKING THESE PROGRAMMES. THAT THAT. DIDN'T BENEFIT. OF THE DONATED OR HAVE THEIR ALLOW THEM TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A PROGRAM THAT THEY JUST DON'T NEED. AND YET YOU KNOW IF IT'S THERE THEY TAKE IT. AND THAT REDUCES THE ABILITY OF US TO ASSIST PEOPLE THAT ARE TRULY IN NEED. SO WHY WHY WAS THAT NOT CONSIDERED IN THIS BILL. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION- YOU MENTIONED WHAT IS THE CEILING THE CEILING OF THE GLASS CEILING IT'S A FEELING THAT NEEDS TO BE BROKEN BECAUSE MOTHERS AND PARTICULARLY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WORK. REGARDLESS OF MUCH MONEY THEY MAKE AND I'M GLAD THAT THE CHAMBER POINTED THIS OUT AS WELL IN TERMS OF. LOW WAGE WORKERS AND HIGH INCOME WAGE WORKERS MOTHERS DON'T GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO STAY I'M GOING TO GO TO WORK TODAY OR I'M GOING TO BE A CHILD CARE PROVIDER TODAY OR I'M GONNA YOU KNOW BE THE SOLE EARNER. IN MY FAMILY THERE IS NO CHOICE MOTHERS DO ALL OF THAT I WOULD SAY THAT PARENTS DO ALL OF THAT SO THERE ARE CORPORATIONS ALREADY OFFERING THIS BENEFIT LIKE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK. WHO WORKS THERE. RIGHT IT'S MOSTLY ENGINEERS. OF HIGH WAGE EARNERS THAT ALREADY HAVE THIS BENEFIT AND IT'S NOT A BENEFIT. THAT IS THE FIRST PRIORITY TO YOU THE BACKUP CHILD CARE. HOW THE BENEFIT IN CASE YOU NEED IT. NOT THE ONE THING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SOLELY USE. I WORKED ON LEGISLATION IN THE PAST WE'VE ADDED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITION TO AFTER SCHOOL FUNDING. HUGE DEAL IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT. CHILDREN IN LOW INCOME AREAS PARTICULARLY LIKE AND COMMUNITIES THAT I SERVE HAVE A SAFE SPACE WHERE THEY COULD BE. I WANT PARENTS ARE WORKING SO THAT THERE. ARE BEING EDUCATED THAT THEY HAVE RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS BUT EVERY YEAR WE CONTINUOUSLY. CUT FUNDING OR DON'T HAVE AS MUCH RESOURCES TO OTHER PARTICULAR AREAS OF CHILD KERR THERE IS A HUGE INTENT AND THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF THINGS PASSED IN TERMS OF. EARLY CHILD CARE. AFTER SCHOOL CARE. BUT A BACKUP CHILD CARE PROVIDED BY YOUR EMPLOYER IS QUITE DIFFERENT. AND IN FACT WE HAVE DATA THAT SHOWS THAT. AN EMPLOYER WHO OFFERS SUPPORT FOR CHILDCARE. ABSENCES AT THAT COMPANY DECREASED BY 2230% AND TURNOVER DROPPED BY THIRTY SEVEN OF 60% THAT IS ACTUALLY A BENEFIT. FOR CORPORATIONS SO THAT THERE'S LESS TURNOVER LESS MONEY SPENT ON TRAINING. AND LESS MONEY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S GOING TO TAKE ANOTHER POSITION. SO IF WHAT I'M HEARING YOU SAY IS THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS BENEFICIAL TO LOW INCOME OR LOW WAGE WORKERS I'M WITH YOU. BUT WE WANT TO MAKE IT FLEXIBLE FOR EVERY SINGLE PARENT EVERY SINGLE MOTHER ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT'S THE INTENT RIGHT SIR IS A- PERSON WHO ACTUALLY GREW UP WITH THE DAD- WITH THE ONES WITH THE DAD. AND OUR MOM MOM MOM MOM PASSED AWAY SO- DADS HAD THAT SAME ISSUE AND YOU KNOW HE DID MANAGE. BUT ALSO- WHAT I WANTED TO THAT POINT OUT WAS THE GOOGLES. AND THE FACEBOOKS AND BIG COMPANIES YOU MENTIONED THEY CAN AFFORD TO DO THAT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY DO TO HELP. BUILD THE WORKFORCE THAT THEY WANT- SOME CORPORATE SOME COMPANIES CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FORCING THEM TO. GO INTO THAT WORLD AND COMPETE AND FROM A- ATTRACTIONS STANDPOINT. FOR AREAS LIKE THE AREA I LIVE IN WE NEED MORE MANUFACTURING WE NEED MORE BUSINESSES TO COME IN SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE OFF OF THE COMMUTE. AND STOP IN WHICH HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT. YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BUSINESS RETENTION IT'S ABOUT BUSINESS ATTRACTION AND THE MORE OF THESE TYPE OF- IN POSITIONS ON THESE COMPANIES THAT WE PUT IN. THE THAT MORE DIFFICULT THE ENVIRONMENT IS FOR THEM TO OPERATE. THE LESS WE'RE GONNA HAVE COMPANIES AND THAT MEANS LESS JOBS AND THAT MEANS THOSE GLASS CEILINGS DON'T GET BROKEN BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE AREN'T WORKING. SO SO THAT'S MY CONCERN YOU KNOW I GET I SEE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS THAT THIS IS HAVING ON. ON ON THESE COMPANIES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE HERE. AND THEY'RE NOT COMING HERE. AND BECAUSE IT'S NOT A CHOICE NOW OF MOVING OUT. BECAUSE THAT'S A HUGE CHOICE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN HERE FOR SO LONG AND NOW THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHILE WE DO BUSINESS HERE ANYMORE. THAT'S A HUGE UNDERTAKING THE FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S CONSIDERING DOING MANUFACTURING HERE- NUYS WILL DO IN ARIZONA AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE COMPETING AGAINST. AND THAT'S WHAT'S HURTING AREAS LIKE OURS AND THAT'S WHAT'S HELPING. CREATE MORE POLLUTION INSTEAD OF LEFT SO. THERE'S MY CONCERN THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO JUST THANK YOU FOR RAISING WE TALK ABOUT MONTH QUITE A BIT. OF MOTHERS HAVE BEEN HIGHLY IMPACTED BY COAL THE NINETEEN. BUT I DO WANNA THANK YOU FOR SHARING. YOUR STORY ABOUT YOUR YOUR FATHER AND BEING A SINGLE DAD. THIS ALSO IS BENEFICIAL TO PARENTS TO OPT INTO MOMS TO DADS- IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT THE JOBS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND RESOURCES ARE HERE THEY WERE ABLE TO RETURN TO THE WORKFORCE AS WE THINK ABOUT. AND QUITE HONESTLY REIMAGINE A DIFFERENT TPE OF WORKPLACE A AND WORKPLACES AND- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARENTS TO THRIVE COVERT NINETEEN REALLY TAUGHT US LIKE WE CAN WORK DIFFERENTLY. CORPORATIONS CANNOT WORK DIFFERENTLY WE NEED. YOU KNOW WORK DIFFERENTLY. AMID THE PANDEMIC AND SO IF NOT NOW WHEN- AND SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO REIMAGINE TO RETHINK WHAT. THE WORKFORCE LOOKS LIKE FOR WORKING PARENTS AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO DO THE RIGHT THING MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH- SUMMER DOES ALSO. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S CREATIVE IT'S DIFFERENT IT'S A NEW APPROACH- I THINK YOU KNOW I WAS A SINGLE MOM FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND I WAS RAISED BY A SINGLE MOTHER. AND I. THE EMERGENCY CHILDCARE SITUATIONS WERE OFTEN CAUSED BY WORK. YOU KNOW AND I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO DRAG MY KIDS. BACK TO WORK WITH ME WHEN I HAD TO GO. IN AND GO IN FOR WHATEVER REASON BUT NOT ALL WORKERS HAVE GOTTEN SO I'D REALLY ARGUE THOUGH TOO. RIGHT NOW WHILE WE'RE SEEING ALL THESE STORIES ABOUT HOW HARD IT IS TO GET WORKERS TO COME BACK. THAT'S PART OF THE EQUATION HERE YES YOU CAN MOVE SOMETHING THE ARIZONA DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU DON'T PAY ENOUGH AND PROVIDE ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY WANT THAT JOB WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THAT FOR. WAY TOO LONG- THE UNITED STATES HAS HAS RELIED ON- LARGELY UNPROTECTED IMMIGRANT WORKERS TO PICK UP THE SLACK AT THE BOTTOM. AND WITH THE CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IT'S ONLY YOU KNOW IT IT IT'S BECOMING CLEAR THAT OUR WORK FORCE RULES NATIONALLY DO NOT WORK. FOR WORKING PARENTS. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW IF. THEY'RE THERE ARE THINGS I THINK WE CAN WORK ON IN THIS TICKET TO STRENGTHEN AND TO MAKE IT MORE WORKABLE THAT- AND I DO THINK. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE IT IS BACK UP CHILD CARE IT'S NOT JUST THE FOR SIXTY HOURS I UNDERSTAND I THINK WE CAN WORK ON THAT AND THIS IS A NEW APPROACH TO IT THOUGH AND I APPRECIATE THAT. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT CHILD CARE ENOUGH- AS A BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT AT ONE OF THE REASONS WOMEN DROPPED OUT OF THE WORKFORCE WAS BECAUSE OF OUR CHILD CARE ISSUES SO. I JUST I COMMEND YOU FOR DOING THIS HARD WORK IN FOR STARTING A CONVERSATION THAT. IF IT'S NOT JUST CALIFORNIA OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY NEEDS TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND WE KNOW IT DOESN'T START FROM WASHINGTON IT NEVER DOES ALL OF THESE IDEAS START CALIFORNIAN SO I'M GLAD YOU'RE STARTING. LOOKING MOTION. THAT MOTION. IS THEIR- SEGMENT. UP BY SHIP. YEAH YOU JERRY THANK YOU- CALLING FOR BRING THIS FORWARD BECAUSE I DO SHARE MY- COLLEAGUE A SUPPORT OF OBVIOUSLY CHILD CARE- BUT NOT ALL INDUSTRIES ARE CREATED EQUAL. AND WITH I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMESIN THIS COMMITTEE WHEN WE PAINT IN THESE BROAD BRUSHES AND THERE ARE NO. WE COME FROM BUT THAT WAS IN MANUFACTURING OKAY- IF THERE IS A ISSUE WITH A PRESS BRAKE OPERATOR. IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN JUST PULL SOMEBODY OFF THE STREET. TO REPLACE THAT RIGHT I UNDERSTAND THE CHILD CARE IS A HUGE HUGE PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS. BUT TO PUT THESE KIND OF- ONEROUS. MANDATES QUITE FRANKLY ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND I DO I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS LIKE. AT SOME POINT I'LL GO THROUGH THEM- OF WHAT JUST LIKE THIS COMMITTEE JUST TODAY WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE OF THOSE THINGS THAT I THINK THE INTENTIONS ARE GOOD BECAUSE I KNOW YOU I RESPECT YOU. BUT WE HAVE THIS WEIRD IDEA THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS OUT THERE JUST. RANDOMLY HURTING PEOPLE THEY DON'T CARE. AND IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED IN A IN A AND I'M STARTING TO REALLY SEE A PATTERN HERE WHERE EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IT'S ALL ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE AND THAT'S IMPORTANT TO BE SHORT. BUT THERE IS ALSO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BUSINESSES AND MO THERE'S AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE OF THE STATE BUDGET THAT PEOPLE AREN'T LEAVING. BASED ON CERTAIN SECTORS OUR BUDGET IS KIND OF REBOUNDED. THE MY CENTRAL VALLEY IS GETTING DECIMATED OVER THESE ISSUES THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT THE FARM WHERE EVERYONE AT THE FARM LABORERS. IT'S MORE THE MANUFACTURING SIDE THAT I HAVE A REALLY MAJOR CONCERN BECAUSE THAT IS A SKILLED POSITION. AND IF WE JUST GIVE THEM. CHILD CARE IN THE IN THIS IN THIS BILL LIKE THEY ONLY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE CHILD CARE WASN'T AVAILABLE. IT'S JUST ASSUMED. THAT THE BEING TRUTHFUL. WHERE CAN ACTUALLY ASK THAT. I THINK THAT'S KIND OF A PROBLEM SO I THINK IS AS MUCH AS WE CARE ABOUT OUR KIDS. WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OUR EMPLOYERS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY TOO DESERVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE AND I AM AM. VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE'RE GOING. IN SHAKEN NOT STIRRED I THINK YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN. MMHM I'LL BE BEING WANTED BY THE OF THE COMMITTEE TO SOLIDIFY. ANY OTHER QUESTION OR COMMENT FROM MEMBERS- THANK YOU I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION I THINK THE QUOTED CRISIS HAS EXPOSED A LOT OF GAPS. IN OUR SOCIETY FRANKLY I THINK CHILD CARE CERTAINLY IS ONE OF AMON SILICON VALLEY WHAT A HIGH AGE WORKERS EARNERS HIGH WAGE EARNERS THAT ALSO ARE HAVING ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO CHILD CARE AND- IN OCTOBER AND I RESPECT THEM THE THOUGHTS YOUR VICE CHAIR. TALKING ABOUT HOW TO PULL ACROSS THE LINE BUT THERE'S NOT A CHANCE THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO PULL THEM ACROSS THE LINE BECAUSE IT'LL JUST ON THE JOB. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE COSTS AND ALL THAT THE THAT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION IN THAT REGARD. HOW IT IS NOT JUST. ABOUT THE QUANTITY OF JOBS ALSO THE QUALITY OF LIFE PROVIDED BY THE JOBS THAT PEOPLE HAVE AND SO THA IS A CONSTANT CONVERSATION HERE IN THIS BUILDING I KNOW THERE'S CONSTANTLY BILLS GOING FORWARD WORKS THERE'S ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES AND THAT'S OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO WALK OUTLINED HOW TO BALANCE BUT MAKE SURE AT THE END F THE DAY. BUT IF PEOPLE IF IT'S A RACE TO THE BOTTOM IS THE WORKERS GOT CRUSHED IN THAT REACHED THE BOTTOM AND SELF HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE CREATING QUALITY JOBS WHILE OUR ECONOMY HOPEFULLY CONTINUES NUMBER TO EXCEL AND GROW. SO WITH THAT- WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION FOR THE SUMMER GONZALEZ SECOND BY SUMMER STONE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT GOT HERE WHICH I CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS AND APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION I DO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE IN A NEW ERA. IN WHICH WE MUST REIMAGINE AND RETHINK WHAT WORK AND CHILD CARE LOOKS LIKE NOT ONLY IN THE STATE BUT ACROSS THE NATION. THIS IS AN ACTUAL EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE OF WHAT REALLY SHATTERING THE GLASS CEILING LOOKS LIKE AND WE MUST BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THAT PARENTS AND SPECIFICALLY MOTHERS ARE CARE GIVERS FRONTLINE AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF PICKING WHICH ROLE THEY WANNA PLAY THAT DAY AB ELEVEN SEVENTY NINE IS ABOUT EQUITY. AS MENTIONED IN LOW WAGE AND HIGH WAGE WORKER FIRST. OF THE 7% OF. PROVIDING BACK UP CHILD CARE RIGHT NOW IT'S A BEEN A- IT IS THE EMPLOYEE AT THE- OF THE ECONOMIC LADDER. THAT RECEIVED ASSISTANCE. OUT WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU READ IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT A MOTHER HAS BEEN ARRESTED BECAUSE THEY LEFT THEIR KIDS IN THE CAR ALONE AT HOME BECAUSE THEY HAD TO GO. TAKE AN INTERVIEW OR GO TO A JOB THAT'S A REALITY. AND NO MOTHER NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO BE OCKED UP AND BOOKED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CHILD CHARACTER TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILY. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LARGER COMPANIES TO THINK ABOUT THE REALITIES. WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN PROVENABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR WOMEN TO RETURN TO THE WORKFORCE GIVEN THE CURRENT SITUATION. WHEN COMPANIES AS I MENTIONED PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CHILD CARE. EMPLOYEE ABSENCES DECREASE BY 2230% TURNOVER DROPPED BY THIRTY SEVEN TO SIXTY PERCENT- AND THAT IS WHY.

WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY PROHIBITION ANYWHERE IN STATE LAW- THE PROPENSITY OF THE CADENCE TO FROM ENTERING INTO A COMMUNITY WORKFORCE AGREEMENT SO WE THINK THAT THE BILL IS UNNECESSARY. FURTHERMORE THE STATEMENTS BY MR SMITH IN THE INCLUSION OF SECTION TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THE PUBLIC CONTRACTS CODE WHICH REFERS TO PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS.

TO CALIFORNIA SO THERE'S A LOT OF UNANSWERED QUESTIONS TERRITORIES THAT WE'VE NEVER REALLY BOUGHT INTO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THE ALTAR MOTIVE IS SET A STRUCTURE.

TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE ALREADY THAT WILL ENSURE AND ADDRESS. COMMUNITY BASED NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO WORKFORCE. PATHWAYS TO THESE JOBS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE GOOD LIVING. WAGE JOBS.

SEVEN EIGHTY THREE IS A MEMBER GRAY. AND SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB SEVENTY THREE IS A MEASURE TO IMPROVE WORKPLACE SAFETY- CONDITIONS OF SURFACE MINING OPERATIONS THE BILL CONTAINS TWO PRIMARY PROVISIONS FIRST IT REQUIRES THE INSPECTORS REPORT OBSERVED HAZARDS WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO THE MINE OPERATORS THAT THEY CAN BE ADDRESSED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. CURRENTLY OPERATORS MAY NOT BE MADE AWARE OF HAZARDS FOR WEEKS OR MONTHS WE'VE THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS WITHIN SIX MONTHS- THIS WOULD MAKE THAT SEVENTY TWO HOURS OBVIOUSLY- ALLOWING. THE FOLKS MANAGING THOSE- SITES TO ACT QUICKER. THE SECOND PROVISION THE BILL PERMITS BUT DOES NOT REQUIRE CALLOW SHOULD TO ACCEPT SURFACE MINING WORKSITES INTO THE VOLUNTARY. PROTECTION PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THE VPP IS TO ENCOURAGE WORK PLACES TO ADOPTED HERE TO MORE RIGOROUS AND ENHANCED WORKPLACE SAFETY PROGRAMS THAN THE MINIMUM STANDARDS REQUIRED BY LAW. ACCEPTANCE INTO THE PROGRAM IS A HIGH BAR- INVOLVES A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES- IN GAUGING WITH LABOR TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE NO OBJECTIONS- FROM THE UNION OUR WORKERS ON THE GROUND. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY CALCIUM A GRANITE CONSTRUCTION OTHERS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OF HE BILL- CHARLIE RAY FROM CALCIUM AND GARY JOHNSON WITH GRANITE- THEY'RE PREPARED TO MAKE SOME REMARKS AS CHAIRMAN- IF IT PLEASES THE COMMITTEE.

FIRST I NOTICED HAZARDOUS TO BE ISSUED THE MINING OPERATOR WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS IF DURING THE INSPECTION HAZARDS ARE IDENTIFIED. THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN QUICKLY TO PROTECT WORKERS WHILE NOT IMPACTING THE REGULAR CITATION ENFORCEMENT PROCESS STONE. SECOND. IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONFLICT IN THE. YES GOOD MORNING- MY NAME IS GARY JOHNSON I'M WITH GRANITE CONSTRUCTION COMPANY- A MEMBER OF UNIONIZED CONSTRUCTION AGGREGATE AND MINING COMPANIES LIKE GRANITE CONSTRUCTION DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL. WE'VE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED AT ALL THE MANY MONTHS PASSED BETWEEN SAFETY INSPECTION AND WHEN WE LEARNED ABOUT A HAS YOUR- WE DO NOT WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THE CITATION PROCESS WHICH CAN REQUIRE MONTHS TO COMPLETE. NOR DO WE WANT TO LIMIT THE PENALTIES THAT MIGHT BE AT THAT. SO WE DEVISED A SOLUTION THAT LEAVES THE CITATION PRODUCT THAT I'M TAG. BUT ALLOWED. TO BE NOTIFIED ABOUT HAS. THAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS BILLBOARD IN INJURY TO AN EMPLOYEE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT NAME AFFILIATION A POSITION ON THE BILL IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM. IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTY THREE.

MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO OPPOSITION TO QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I KNOW WE HAVE A MOTION WE DON'T HAVE A SECOND HAS WILL MOST PROVIDERS ARE SECOND. AS A SECOND FROM DECEMBER SAY ART OPENING CONVOCATION THE SUMMER GONZALEZ. I JUST IT'S SO SIMPLE I IT'S SO SIMPLE I WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE LIKE READ IT OVER AND OVER. NORMALLY THE CITATION HAS TO BE GIVEN WITHIN SIX MONTHS BUT THIS SAYS YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY TELL THE OPERATOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING WRONG WITHIN SEVEN TWO HOURS FOR IT JUST FOR THE GENERAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF. OF MAKING IT A BETTER WORKPLACE FOR THE WORKERS IF YOU WELL I MEAN IT THAT'S NOT WHAT IT SAYS BUT IT'S A QUICKER NOTICE THOUGH THAT. THE CORRECTION CAN BE MADE ALTHOUGH OF THE CITATIONS THE CITATION WILL STILL COME OUT. IS THAT RIGHT THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR EIGHTEEN TO LONG AND THE- THERE'S NO ADVANTAGE TO- THE EMPLOYER OF THE SITE A IN THE SENSE OF RELIEVING SOME LIABILITY FROM A CITATION RECITATIONS CITATION IF THERE'S SOMETHING- OUT OF SORTS IT NEEDS TO BE RECTIFIED. WHAT THIS DOES THOSE AND OBVIOUSLY CREATES A SAFER WORKPLACE IN THE- IN THE NEAR TERM- WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS GIVING THOSE FOLKS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT RIGHT AWAY- WHICH IS IN EVERYBODY'S INTEREST- IT ALSO INTERNED WITH THE SECOND PROVISION THE BILL ALLOWS. THE MINING SITE TO A IN ESSENCE BE A GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN RIGHT IF I'M GONNA GO OUT OF MY WAY TO IT HERE TO HIGHER STANDARDS TO CORRECT THE- A VIOLATION WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS- GOOD CORPORATE CITIZEN. STREAMLINED THE PROCESS. ABBAS WANTED BUT YEAH THERE'S NOTHING YOUR RESIDENTS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD VERY SIMPLE BILL WITH THE TWO PROVISIONS THAT I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING WHAT HAPPENS IF- I GUESS IT'S THE GOVERNMENT WHO IS ISSUING THE NOTICE WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS RIGHT IT'S WHOEVER'S DOING THE INSPECTION- WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T. ISSUE IT IN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND ARE THEY- PROHIBITED FROM DOING THE VIOLATE THAT SALVATION OKAY NO THERE'S THAT THAT THERE'S NO. I WISH THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE SITE AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT. THE VARIOUS AGENCIES WOULD IN FACT MEET WITH A CENTERS BUT IF THEY DON'T THERE'S NO. FALLOUT FROM THAT AND THEN IT'S ANOTHER DAY GONE BY WITHOUT. A VIOLATION BEING ADDRESSED RIGHT. RIGHT I'M ANY OTHER OF COURSE COM YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE MORE QUICKLY THINGS GET RESOLVED IT'S GOOD FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED THEY WERE TRYING TO GET AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T. PRECLUDE CITATIONS AND OTHER MECHANISMS THAT ARE IN PLACE- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK IT'S BETTER THAT- TO THE EMPLOYERS- SOONER RATHER LATER THAN THAT NOT ONLY IS IT A LOWER LIABILITY TO THEM IT CREATES A SAFER WORK ENVIRONMENT MORE QUICKLY WHICH IS WHAT WE ALL WANT. SO WITH THAT WE DO- HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE CEMETERY I JUST THANK YOU FOR THE DIALOGUE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR RIVAL THANK YOU SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION OF MOISTURE FOR A SECOND BY SUMMER SAY ART THOUGH AMOUNT OF SECRETARY PAUL THE ROLE IN AB SEVEN EIGHTY THREE.

AB SIX FIFTY- WITH ARE YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND- MR RODRIGUEZ IN THE AUDIENCE. N. THE OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. YOU KNOW IT'S SO. ALMOST A YEAR AGO FROM TODAY THE GOVERNOR NEWSOM DECLARED THE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND- WHILE WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE. OF WORKING- FROM THE SAFETY OF OUR HOMES. OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. DAY IN DAY OUT THEY HAD TO GO ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS PANDEMIC. THE GOING TO COMBAT AGAINST THIS HORRIFIC VIRUS. THEY WENT TO WORK PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK ON A DAILY BASIS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES OUR LOVED ONES. THOSE AMONG US. WHO SUFFERED AND DIED. FROM THIS TERRIBLE VIRUS. THEY WENT INTO A DANGEROUS WORKPLACE ON A DAILY BASISOFTEN WITH INADEQUATE PROTECTIVE. EQUIPMENT LACK OF TO. LAW WORK YOU FEW BROUGH. IN ORDER TO TAKE CARE OF OTHERS IN THE SAME LIVES. MANY AS I JUST INDICATED HAVE PAID A SIGNIFICANT PRICE OF FRONT LINE WORK WITH THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SCARS TO SHOW FOR IT. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THE OVER SIXTEEN HUNDRED HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. A SURVEY OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS THEY ARE HEROES. AND THAT'S WHY THEY DESERVE THIS RIGHT RECOGNITION AND RETENTION BONUS THE HAZARD PAY THE COMBAT PAY THAT IS BEING PROPOSED IN AB SIX FIFTY. I WOULD LIKE TO. TURN IT OVER TO OUR TO SUPPORTING WITNESSES FOR THIS BILL. MATT LEADS FROM SEIU AND GISELA THOMAS A RESPIRATORY SPECIALIST WITH THE DESERT. REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER TO TALK ABOUT HER FRONT LINE EXPERIENCE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WE ARE WITNESSES FOR UP TO TWO MINUTES EACH AND SO WE HAVE A MANAGING AND GISELA THOMAS- MATT IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY MEMBERS MATHIS A ABOUT THE AS YET YOU CALIFORNIA THE PROUD SPONSOR OF EIGHTY SIX FIFTY. FIRST ELECTED I THANK THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR THIS THEIR WORK ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE- THROUGHOUT THE CALL THE NINETEENTH PANDEMIC HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES PROTECTING RESIDENTS ARE NURSING HOMES. CARING FOR PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS AND VACCINATING OUR LOVED ONES. FOR THE PAST YEAR HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE GONE TO WORK EVERY DAY KNOWING THAT THEY WERE RISKING THEIR OWN LIVES. AND HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES. IN NURSING HOMES AND HOSPITALS HEALTHCARE WORKERS COMP THREE ASIAN SIMPLY FOR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE NOT PERMITTED TO BE WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. AND WORKERS THROUGHOUT HEALTHCARE I'VE WITNESSED SUFFERING THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS LIKE A WAR ZONE OR IN THE WAKE. OF A DISASTER LIKE HURRICANE KATRINA. AND IT. IN A TO- TO THE DIRECTORATE SEVEN FACTION STAFFING SHORTAGES INCREASED PATIENT RATIO AND GRUELING SHIFTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF BURNOUT EMOTIONAL TRAUMA AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC HEALTHCARE WORKERS FECES CONDITIONS WITH INSUFFICIENT PROTECTIVE pHEALTHCARE WORKERS TO MAKE OR BUY THEIR OWN P. P. ONCE IT WAS CLEAR THAT THEY CANNOT GET ADEQUATE PROTECTION FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS. HEALTHCARE WORKERS HAVE ALSO WENT TO EXTREME LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR FAMILY SAFE INCLUDING SOME CORN CAME AWAY FROM THEIR FAMILIES FOR WEEKS FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. EIGHTY SIX FIFTY THE NECESSARY TO HELP RETAIN SKILLED AND EXPERIENCED HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO EXPAND ITS HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AT THE AGING POPULATION INCREASED DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THE MAJORITY OF THE LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN RT LIVE AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS. NOW MANY HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE REACHING A BREAKING POINT AND CONSIDERING LEAVING THE PROFESSION. ASEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED JEFF TODAY KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION RELEASED A REPORT SAYING THREE INTENT HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE CONSIDER CONSIDERING LEAVING THE PROFESSION WHICH WILL EXASPERATED ACCESS ISSUES THE CARE- IN OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. HEALTHCARE WORKER TURNOVER COMES WITH HIGH COSTS OF TRAINING REPLACE WORKERS AND ALSO JEOPARDIZES PATIENT CARE. THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME TO INCENTIVIZE HEALTHCARE WORKERS TO REMAIN AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO FUTURE HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT THEY WILL BE SUPPORTED DURING DIFFICULT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. EVEN PROVIDERS HAVE RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR BONUSES TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN HEALTHCARE WORKERS THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAS EVEN USED- WORKERS TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE MONEY CITING THE NEED TO PROVIDE HAZARD PAY. AS PART OF WHY HOSPITALS NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER HOW TO PAY LARGELY FAILED TO MATERIALIZE AND MANY COMPANIES THAT DID PROVIDE SOME FORM ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC ENDED THOSE BENEFITS AFTER A FEW WEEKS OR MONTHS. HEALTH CARE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN IT BENEFITED FROM BILLIONS IN FEDERAL SUPPORT DURING THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING DIRECT GRANTS AND TAX RELIEF THAT WOULD COME FROM THE CARADOC AND OTHER FEDERAL STIMULUS BILL. RECORD BREAKING INVESTING COMES IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED OPERATIONAL REVENUE. MANY HEALTHCARE. INTO TWENTY TWENTY EVEN MORE PROFITABLE THAN THEY HAD IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT THOSE GAMES HAVE NOT BEEN SHARED WITH THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK. THIS BILL SIMPLY ASK WHEN EMPLOYERS CALL THEIR HEALTHCARE WORKERS HEROES. IS THAT JUST HOLLOW WORDS. EVOKE FOR EIGHTY SIX FIFTY PROVIDES SUBSTANTIVE CAN'T WILL PROVE TO HELP THE WORKERS THAT THEIR PSYCHIC SACRIFICES DURING THE PANDEMIC ARE RECOGNIZED AND INVESTED IN OUR FUTURE TO ENSURE THAT OUR CARE GIVERS ARE THERE WHEN WE NEED THEM THE MOST.

THANK YOU AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO MORE FURTHER SUPPORT IN Q. MESSENGER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OF FIRST ALEX HAWTHORN. FOLLOWED BY VALERIE LAKEY SO ALEX BE ON THE LINE PLEASE PROCEED. INSURE THOUGHT PROPER ACTUALLY FELT LIKE YOU CAN GO FIRST IN AN AUTO. THE GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS VALERIE LAKEY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY RELATIONS AT MAYERS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL DISTRICT WHERE VERY SMALL RURAL CRITICAL ACCESS AND PUBLIC DISTRICT HOSPITAL LOCATED IN NORTHEASTERN SHASTA COUNTY WE HAVE TWENTY TWO ACUTE CARE BEDS AND NINETY NINE SKILLED NURSING BEDS WE SERVE A GEOGRAPHIC AREA OF OVER EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE MILES WITH THE NEXT NEAREST HOSPITAL TO ACCESS OVER SEVENTY FIVE MILES AWAY. THE SERVICES IN JOB TO PROVIDE ARE VITAL TO OUR VERY VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. WE STRONGLY OPPOSE AB SIX FIFTY- ARE NOT THAT WE DON'T EXTREMELY CARE FOR OUR OUR STAFFALL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PLUS MEMBERS OF OUR- FACILITY CLINICAL AND NON CLINICAL. ARE VERY ESSENTIAL AND HAVE BEEN SELFLESS HEROES DURING A REALLY DIFFICULT YEAR. THAT'S WHY MAYORS AND MANY OTHER HOSPITALS AND PROVIDERS. HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS AND EXPENSE TO REWARD AND SUPPORT OUR WORKERS. ON OUR OWN ACCORD WE HAVE PROVIDED TWO ROUNDS OF HAZARD PAY BONUSES TO ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES BASED ON THE HOURS THAT THEY WORK. WE EXTENDED THE CODE SICK PAY POLICY AFTER IT LAPSED AT THE END OF. I'M TWENTY TWENTY. WE TRIED TO DO MORE THAN JUST MONETARY ASSISTANCE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US TO SHOW OUR EMPLOYEES THAT THEY ARE VALUED AND THEIR TOTAL WELL BEING IS A PRIORITY. AND WITH THAT IN MIND WE HIRED A DEDICATED EMPLOYEE SERVING AS A WELLNESS COORDINATOR. DURING THIS LAST YEAR JUST FOR STAFF WITH THEIR OVERALL WELLNESS IN MIND AND SIMPLY TO JUST BE THERE FOR OUR STAFF WITH EDUCATION ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT DURING THIS TOUGH TIME. WE PROVIDED DAYCARE ASSISTANCE MEALS AT NO COST FRESTON MAMA'S PROGRAM. OUR SMALL HOSPITAL DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA RESOURCES TO SPARE OTHER CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL WE ARE COST BASED WE SERVE A LARGE MEDICARE ALL MEDICARE POPULATION OF OVER 80% ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES FOR US WOULD ONLY MEAN REDUCE SERVICES. THE ADDITIONAL COST OF AB SIX FIFTY WOULD PUT A HEAVY FINANCIAL STRAIN ON OUR FACILITIES AND MANY OTHER SMALL FACILITIES LIKE CARDS. IT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE THE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE MADE TO MEET THE LONG TERM NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STAFF. NOT JUST TO THOSE CARVED OUT FOR THE EXTRA PAY IN THIS BILL. THE ENORMOUS UNFUNDED UNFUNDED COSTS IMPOSED BY SB SIX FIFTY WOULD LIKELY LEAVE US WITH NO OTHER OPTION THAN TO ELIMINATE OR CUT SERVICES. IN OUR pDISTRICT THAT MEANS CUTTING SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO OPERATE AT A LOSS INCLUDING HOSPICE CARE CARDIAC REHAB AND OTHER OUTPATIENT ANCILLARY SERVICES. THESE CUTS WOULD BE DEVASTATING MANY OF OUR PATIENTS CAN SIMPLY NOT TRAVEL TO SEVENTY FIVE MILES OR MORE TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES ELSEWHERE. AT TEN IN THE SERVICES WOULD ALSO HER STAFF THE VERY WORKERS THAT THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO PROTECT. AB SIX FIFTY WOULD BE DEVASTATING FOR OUR SMALL PUBLIC HOSPITAL AND AT AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THERE'S SO MUCH MORE TO OUR STORY AND I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANY TIME THAT YOU HAVE THEM WE RESPECTFULLY URGE. YOU TO VOTE NO ON AB SIX FIFTY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AND WE ALSO HAVE WITH US ALEX HAWTHORN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. HE CHAIR MEMBERS OUT CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE CLOSED EIGHTY SIX FIFTY. CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC HELPING OUR STATE SURVIVED THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN A CENTURY. TO TAKE CARE OF THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FLOODING OUR HOSPITALS AND I TO USE. WE HAD TO MAKE MONUMENTAL OPERATIONAL CHANGES THAT HAVE CRIPPLED OUR HOSPITALS FINANCES. OUR WORKERS HAVE MADE EXTRAORDINARY SACRIFICES THAT'S WHY CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS IMMEDIATELY PUT INTO PLACE POLICIES TO SUPPORT AND ASSIST THEM. THE EFFORTS TO REWARD AND RETAIN WORKERS COMES ON TOP OF COMPENSATION THAT ALREADY LEADS THE NATION. FOR EXAMPLE CALIFORNIA'S NURSES ARE THE HIGHEST PAID IN THE COUNTRY 15% MORE THAN NOT SECOND HIGHEST BANK STATE. THIS COMPENSATION IS NOT INCLUDE THE HIGH LEVEL BENEFITS ANOTHER PAYMENT OFFERED BY HOSPITALS SUCH AS BONUSES AND PAY INCREASES. CHILD CARE SERVICES SUBSIDIES EXTENDED LEAVE WELLNESS AND COUNSELING SUPPORT LIKE YOUR TODAY- AND EVEN IN SOME CASES TEMPORARY HOUSING. UNFORTUNATELY OUR HOSPITALS ARE FACED WITH STARK FINANCIAL REALITY THAT COULD CRIPPLE THE HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET. HOSPITALS HAVE FIFTEEN TO FOURTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND RECEIVED ONLY EIGHT POINT SIX BILLION AND FEDERAL RELIEF. BELIZE A SIX BILLION DOLLAR LOSS SPREAD ACROSS HOSPITALS AND STATE. OVER HALF OF HOSPITALS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS. EIGHTY SIX FIFTY IMPOSES BILLIONS MORE ADVANTAGE COSTS FOR HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING IN SOME CASES LITERALLY TO STING OPERATION. THE END RESULT OF EIGHTY SIX FIFTY IS DEVASTATING LOSSES TO SERVICE SINCE. AS THE STORY HEARD TODAY AT AND TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND IT PUTS OUR SAFETY NET IN JEOPARDY FOR THAT REASON WE MUST OPPOSE EIGHTY SIX FIFTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MILLER NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ANYONE IN THE ROOM. IN OPPOSITION AB SIX FIFTY. WILL MOVE ON TO THE PHONES ANYONE ON THE PHONES IN OPPOSITION TO AB. SIX FIFTY.

FORWARD I THINK I'M WE'D BE OVERSEEING OB ABOUT HOW MUCH DO TO BE ABLE TO SOME OUR HEALTH CARE WERE FOR WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN LIFE THAT THEY'VE- AND- EXPIRY THEY HAVE. ALSO READ TO THAT YOU IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO ASSIST YOU KNOW OUR HOUSE AS WELL- HAVE BEEN IN IN STRESSED TRYING TO MEET THE MOMENT AND DO SO WITH THE DIGNITY IN CARE- AND TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS RIGHT I THINK IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION- TO BE GOING AND I JUST HAD- WHAT WHAT I HOPE FOR OUR OUR OUR MORE JUST TECHNICAL QUESTIONS- BUT YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING I THINK THE BROAD- INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE AND THAT IS MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE USING THIS OPPORTUNITY AS- PROFITS HAVE BEEN ASSUMED AND THERE IS- YOU KNOW MORE THERE TO REALLY MAKE SURE. ENDS UP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE BEEN- HAVING HAVING THE BRUNT OF THE EXPERIENCES HERE- I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION IS- ARE THESE. THE KINDS OF DECISIONS ARE HOW WE EVEN. ASKED TO HAVE. MEET AND CONFER CONVERSATIONS IF IT'S A RETENTION ISSUE AND THERE IS A- A THREAT OR A REAL REALITY THAT. WE MIGHT BE- REALLY LOSING SO MUCH OF OUR WORK FORCE THAT- THE HOSPITAL'S ORDER SYSTEMS THAT MIGHT COLLAPSE- I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT THAT'S- ALSO A PLACE THAT MAYBE THESE CONVERSATIONS. SHOULD BE TAKING PLACE- ARE. IS NOT GOING ON COULD THAT BE GOING ON. THANK YOU MISTER WARD I- I KNOW THAT- WELL ALL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING OUR INSTITUTIONS YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN TO ME BUT WE DECIDED THE KAISER POLL- THAT THAT CLEARLY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT THE THAT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. OF WHETHER OR NOT TO HEALTH CARE WORKERS MAY BE LEAVING THE PROFESSION- SO I KNOW THAT THERE ARE ON GOING CONVERSATIONS- BUT IT BUT I THINK FOR SOME LIKE THAT WHERE THEY CAN GET ALL THOSE PARTIES TO REALLY DIVE INTO IT KIND OF GETS TO MY NEXT SORT OF LAYERS OF QUESTIONS WHICH IS YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT- MAYBE- JUST KIND OF BROAD BRUSHING CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNTS- WHITE CATEGORIES OF WHAT WE CONSIDER A HEALTH CARE WORKER. ON AND AT WITH NO DISRESPECT MENTORED MANY PROFESSIONS AND GOOD JOBS ON TO THINK ABOUT OUR NURSES AND RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS IN OUR IN OUR PHYSICIANS WHO HAVE LITERALLY BEEN OUT OF THE FRONT DEALING WITH THIS AND- AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM- FOR TWELVE HOURS A DAY GOING THROUGH- THE SUFFERING THAT YOU KNOW LIKE I I'D I DON'T KNOW- BUT THAT. FOR ME THAT KIND OF LIVED EXPERIENCE- AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO FOR COMPENSATION- FOR RETENTION PURPOSES TIME AND FOR- RETRACTED HAZARD PAY- FEELS AGAIN FOR TYING THE TWO TOGETHER AS A NEXUS HERE- MORE WORTHY OF SAY SOMEBODY WHO IS A NON MANAGERIAL ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFFOR A PHARMACIST WORKING SORT OF YOU KNOW IN THE BACK OFFICE- AND YOU KNOW IF THIS BILL IT IF IT HAS THIS BILL PROGRESSES I HOPE THAT MAYBE YOU'LL THINK ABOUT- WAYS TO. SORT OF A LINE AND FINE TUNE SOME OF THE- SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF THIS- THAT SORT OF ALSO REFLECT ON THAT THAT THAT THAT TOO BECAUSE AGAIN A IT YOU'RE TYING YOUR YOUR INTENT FOR THIS BILL- AND THE SOLUTION IS THAT IS A BIT BROAD PRESSED ON AND THEN FURTHER MORE IF THIS IS ABOUT YOU KNOW BENEFITING. OUR EMPLOYEES- WHY ARE ONLY AT- PRIVATE SECTOR. HEALTH CARE EMPLOYEES WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT ALL HEALTH CARE WORKERS. WELL AS YOUR FIRST POINT- YOU KNOW. I THINK THE INTENT OF IT OF THE BILL IS TO- IS TO RECOGNIZE AND RETAIN NOT ONLY THE THAT THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES- THE DATA- WORD TREATING THE PATIENTS DIRECTLY BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW THE SECURITY PERSONNEL THE- THE CUSTODIANS OF MAINE- EVERYONE WHO HAD TO. AGAIN GO AND YOU KNOW DAY IN AND DAY OUT- TO THE FRONT LINES OF A ARE ARE- WHEN WE'RE ASKED PEOPLE TO VERY RISKY ENVIRONMENT YEAH WHAT WITH WITHOUT A DOUBT- BUT- I AM JUST I YOU KNOW I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY. I HOPE THAT- YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING WITH I THINK A LOT OF THE WHITE STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE HERE TO MAYBE SORT OF FINE TUNING IS BECAUSE AGAIN IF THIS WERE A MEET AND CONFER LATER CONVERSATION THAT'S WHERE YOU'D BE SPENDING HOURS REALLY YOU KNOW HAMMERING ALL THIS OUT- YOU KNOW BY THE A LEGISLATION. I THINK IT DESERVES YOU KNOW SOME SOME POINTS DID THE SAME POINTS NEED TO BE HAMMERED OUT AS WELL TO SIR THAT IS WHERE I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT GO IN AND INTO THAT LIMITING. IT TO PRIVATE SECTOR ONLY USER. A RATIONALE. BUT THE MAIN INTENT OF IT WITH THAT TOO WAS- TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN- AND THE CARES. ACT HAS PROVIDED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING- TO- THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS- IS- MISLED SHE INDICATED- IN A ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE FEDERAL. AID WAS TO PROVIDE HAZARD PAY AND YET- WE'RE WE'RE HEARING. YOU KNOW MANY PARTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT- THOSE- THOSE MONIES. HAVE NOT REACHED THE WORKERS- AND SO THAT THAT IS AGAIN THE INTENT OF THE BILL. ON THE BUT BUT MONIES ARE ALSO HEADING TOWARD- PUBLIC HOSPITALS OR TREAT NOT THE PROFIT HOSPITALS. WRECKED THAT IS- THAT IS CORRECT SO- I AGAIN IF IN AS THIS MOVES FORWARD I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEE AGAIN THAT- I DON'T WANT TO DISTINGUISHING OF DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE WORKERS BECAUSE OF WHO THEIR EMPLOYER IS- IF THAT'S THE INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATION I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE ALL OF OUR HEALTHCARE WORKERS. ARE TREATED EQUALLY AS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT THE IF I MAY IF I CAN REFER TO MISTER LEJI HE MAY BE OF ANSWER YEAH THERE MIGHT BE A REASON- I'M NOT THINKING I JUST AGAIN IF THIS IS ABOUT BENEFITS TO THE WORKERS I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE- RECOVERING AS MANY WORKERS AS POSSIBLE. MISTER CHAIR. YES OF COURSE. YES AND THAT WAS A WITH THAT VALUE I'M SORRY THE QUESTION- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY A NUMBER OF- SIGNIFICANT FUNDING HAS GONE DIRECTLY TO COUNTIES CITIES FOR PUBLIC HOSPITALS AS WELL- AND SO- AND THAT ONE OF THE INTENDED USES CAN'T BE FOR AFTERPAY AND SO- YEAH YOU REPRESENTS WORKERS AT BOTH- LOCATIONS AND- I WE WISH WE SHARE IN YOUR CONCERN TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL HEALTHCARE WORKERS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT THEIR SERVICE DURING. THE PANDEMIC AND SO YOU KNOW ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU ON THAT- AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT RECOGNIZING ALL HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHICH IS REALLY FAST AT EIGHT TEN OF OUR EFFORTS THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU YEAH AND AGAIN- JUST THINGS I'D YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THAT THERE'S NOT SOME-IS STEPS AHEAD- AS THESE THINGS GO AND THINGS THAT MAYBE CAN BE EXPLORED AS YOUR- EACH ONE OF THE STEPS AT THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- YOU KNOW CRYPTOLOGY THEM- THROUGH THIS BILL APPROVED FOR THE WORKER DOING I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT HERE TODAY- AND- HOPEFULLY AND AGAIN I'M DEPENDING ON. THE AGE THE LAST POINT AS WELL TO ITS FIRST WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE OTHER- TYPES OF EMPLOYERS HERE- AGAIN THINKING IN MIND ABOUT- THE IMPACT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY'VE HAD- THE HAZARDS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED- UNDER UNDER THESE COVETED AT TIMES- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHETHER IT'S AT- YOU KNOW IN HOME. HEALTH CARE- AGAIN THIRD THIRD DISTINCTIONS THAT- YOU KNOW ARE REASONABLY I THINK YOU KNOW- SHOULD BE- ALIGNED WITH. HOW WE ARE APPLY THIS- A AND I JUST THAT IT WOULD BE IT WOULD WOULD- WE WOULD DO WELL TO A PRE. THAT AND TRY TO TRY TO WORK ON SOME OF THESE FINDINGS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I. APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU A SUMMER GONZALEZ. I WANNA NOT TO. BEAT A DEAD HORSE IS THAT THE RIGHT THING- I THINK. IF SOMEBODY WHO HAS- WORKED EXTENSIVELY LIKE WITH THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS THAT ARE YOU SEE AND ASK ME THIRTY TWO NINE NINE IN PARTICULAR I WAS PERPLEXED- BY THEM NOT BEING INCLUDED IN THIS I AND I DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT UNTIL LAST NIGHT WHEN I READ IT AND THEN. THIS MORNING. DARTED IT DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO ASK THEM BUT- IT DOES SEEM. THAT WE SHOULD BE PROVIDING THE SAME TYPE OF INCENTIVE HEY TO THE EMPLOYEES OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS AS- REQUIRED. PRIVATE HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE IS THAT. S. AS YOU HEARD TO YEAH MR LEGGIO GOD WILL DEFINITELY THE INTENT IS TO- RECOGNIZE AND TO RETAIN ALL HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHETHER PRIVAE OR PUBLIC AND SO ONLY LABOR COMMITTEE GET ASKED TO EXPAND YOUR- BILLS MORE WORKERS- AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD AND IT'S A BIT OF A CONCERN I HATE MY DISTRICT IS SERVED PRIMARILY BY A COMMUNITY CLINICS. AND NONPROFIT COMMUNITY CLINICS WHO DO WE IS THERE A THRESHOLD OR ANTICIPATION THAT WE WILL KNOW THAT THEY CAN USE FEDERAL MONEY FOR THIS PURPOSE IS FOR THESE PURPOSES- THAT THEY HAVE IT- THERE THERE IS JUST A- IT IN A- ABILITY ON ON SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS IS THAT. DID I MISS KIND OF THAT LEVEL OF SCRUTINY EIGHT CAN THE STATE FUNDS SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING OUT FOR ME CLINICS THAT WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY TO SURE YEAH OUT OF I RAISED MANY THAT THE SAME CONCERNS I MEAN. AND I THINK- FROM THE OPPOSITION YOU ARE HEARD A YOU KNOW A COMMON THEME THAT THAT WHILE WE ALL WANT TO RECOGNIZE OUR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T IMPACT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ESPECIALLY IN OUR- OUR OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- I HAVE COMMUTER HEALTH CLINICS ALSO LINDA BY AND I HAD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS. OF AS WE ALL KNOW MANY REPRESENTING NO PRIMARILY MEDIC CAL PATIENTS- FOR WHICH YOU KNOW THEY THEY RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THIS WOULD IMPACT THEIR THEIR ABILITY TO REACH THAT THE GREATEST NUMBER FOR THE GREATEST GOOD- AND SO- WELL WE ARE- CONTINUED THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THANK. THE MOTION FOR A SECOND. THE SECOND FROM SOME REWARD YES THE SUMMER STARTED. ALL RIGHT HEY HAVE A FEW CONCERNS- FIRST THE PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE THEY'VE COVERED THAT PRETTY MUCH AND I THINK THE ANSWER- WAS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE FIRST CALLERS WHO HAD A PUBLIC HOSPITAL AND PROBABLY THOUGHT THAT THIS MIGHT APPLY TO THEM AND- IT WOULD CAUSE THEM TO PROBABLY GO WONDER IF THEY WERE TO HAVE TO PAY OUT- THESE. I GUESS THERE ARE RETENTION BONUS. SECONDLY. WHEN WE REFER TO IT AS A RETENTION BONUS. BECAUSE OF THE STRESS THAT CENTER AND THE PEOPLE AT THE BREAKING POINT AT CENTRAL. IF YOUR DOCTOR MAKING THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR OR MORE- FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS ISN'T GOING TO MAKE YOU STAY IF YOU'RE BURNED OUT. BURNOUT IS BURN OUT. AND I CAN TELL YOU IN IN THE FIRE SERVICE OR OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES- IF SOMEBODY IS THAT BURNED OUT IT'S CALLED STRESS DISABILITY RETIREMENT. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FUNCTION ANYMORE- SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS PAINT THIS PAYMENT. CAN BE CALLED REALLY RETENTION. TYPE OF PAYMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE RETAINED BECAUSE THEY GOT FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUCKS OR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS. WHAT IT IS AN APPRECIATION PAYMENT. AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE APPRECIATION PAYMENT APPROACH. BUT WHAT I DISAGREE WITH IS IF I APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARDS- DEDICATION TO HIS JOB HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY. I AND I WANT TO I WANT HIM TO HAVE A THOUSAND DOLLARS I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU TO GIVEN THE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN SHAKE HIS HAND SAY HEY YOU'RE WELCOME. NOW IF WE WANT TO TRULY. RECOGNIZE THE JOB THAT THESE PEOPLE DID. THEN WE NEED TO ADD UP WHAT THE COST IS. TAKE SOME OF THAT MONEY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SENT US THE STATE. AND AND SEND OUT THOSE CHECKS JUST LIKE THEY SEND OUT THE CHECKS FOR- YOU KNOW THE STIMULUS PAYMENTS- THAT WOULD COVER ALL OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS. WE WOULD KNOW WHAT THE COST IS GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE OF MY OTHER QUESTIONS DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST IS FOR THIS FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRY. I KNOW I'VE SEEN NOW. ESTIMATES BUT I DON'T HAVE IT OFF HAND OKAY THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S RIGHT WE DON'T WE DON'T NEED TO GET THE EXACT FIGURES BUT IT'S A LOT- IF WE CAN ABSORB THAT COST IS AN ASSEMBLY. AS THE SENATE IS THE LEGISLATURE THEN WE SHOULD SAY HEY YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO THIS WE'RE GOING TO REWARD THOSE VOTES FOR THE ALL THE GREAT. GREAT WORK THEY DID. AND BY THE WAY THEIR WORK EXTENDS BEYOND CODE. THEIR WORK IT STANDS IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN IN A BEES BUSY ER- THERE'S HEROIC ACTIONS GOING IN ALL THE TIME- THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. I REALIZE THAT THEY GOT SOME SAID THEY GOT MONEY. TO HELP RECOVER. AND KEEP THEM ALIVE. BECAUSE DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS IS SOMETHING I LEARNED BY TALKING TO THE CEOS OF THE HOSPITALS. BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL YOU GUYS WERE PROBABLY THE ONLY ONES DOING OKAY YOU'RE IN BUSINESS. THEY SAID ACTUALLY NO IN FACT WE'VE LAID OFF HALF OUR STAFF. BECAUSE THE REST OF THE HOSPITAL OUTSIDE OF THE ER WAS NOT FUNCTIONING. SO THEY DID LOSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY. SO YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW I. THESE BILLS ARE HARD BECAUSE YOU'RE IN ON ONE HAND WE'RE TRYING TO REWARD PEOPLE FOR DOING THIS AWESOME JOB. AND RECOGNIZE THEM FOR THAT AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO RECOGNIZE THESE THESE VALIANT WORKERS- THROUGHOUT THIS THING. BUT I THINK IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH I THINK THE APPROACH WE NEED TO TAKE IT FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST IS. MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE FOLKS AND IF WE'RE GONNA GIVE THEM A REWARD THEN WE GIVEN THE REWARD. AND NOT PUT THIS ON AND SURPASSING USE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO THE DO THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. THAT THAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO GET IT FROM THE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE DONE. THEY SHOULDN'T BE- GRANT AND THERE SHOULD BE IN AND AROUND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS. AND I WOULD SAY THAT NO MORE ANYMORE THAN IF WE WERE TO TAKE FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS FROM EACH EMPLOYEE FOR. FOR IT WAS A PRETTY SLOW YEAR. THEY. TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. AND SO THIS WOULD BE THE SAME I THINK THIS IS THE SAME WAY I THINK WE'RE INTERFERING WHERE WE CANNOT. LOVE THE IDEA. BUT I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING IT AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE EXPLORED BECAUSE THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. AND IT WOULD GIVE US THE IDEA HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST AND WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD IT. IS THAT THAT BECOMES A BUTTON AND TURNING FACTOR IN A LOT OF THESE. THANK YOU FOR THE IDEA I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU. AND IF I MAKE A BRIEFLY ON THE CHAIR US IN MISSISSIPPI ARE TO AYE. I'VE HAD MANY SIMILAR CONVERSATIONS TO. GET AWAY WITH MY- CEOS OF HOSPITALS- IN IN IN MY DISTRICT AND- YEAH AND IN FACT I ASKED TO- THE ECONOMIST SAID THAT THE RESEARCH RESEARCHERS AT S. YEAH YOU FOR DATA ON- THE HOSPITAL'S I. THINK SO WE ARE YOU KNOW TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS ROOTED IN REALITY THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO- YOU KNOW ACHIEVE THOSE DUAL GOALS OF RECOGNIZING A RETAINING ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT IMPACTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE- I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE- AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME YOUR COMMENTS- AND- WELL WE WILL CONTINUE TO FINE TUNE THE BILL. I HAVE A GREAT EDUCATION THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ONE OF THE COMMENTS- WE DO HAVE A MOTION FOR SUMMARY GONZALEZ SECOND BY SOME MEMBER WARD- IN AND AS THE AUTHOR MURATSUCHI AN INDICATOR EARLIER I DIDN'T. SIGN ON TO THIS BILL AS WELL I THINK THAT- EVEN HEARING FROM OPPOSITION EVERYONE IN PRINCIPLE AGREES THAT THESE HEROES NEED TO BE. WE NEED TO BE SHOT SHOW OF. APPRECIATION AND I THINK GOING FROM. A PRINCIPLED POLICY IS ALWAYS THE CHALLENGE AND SO. I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION. WE JUST HAD SO. WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT I'M SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL ON A. B. SIX FIFTY. MOTION IS DUE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA FIVE KALRA AYE FLORA. FLORA NOW GONZALEZ. GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER AYE DON'T. SEE I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW FOUR.

LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO ON YOUR BILLS RIGHT NOW- HAND SO THAT'S LEAST- START WITH THE FIRST ONE A. B. SEVEN. AND YOU MAY BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTY. LAST YEAR THIS COMMITTEE PASSED AB TWENTY NINETY TO A SIMILAR BUILT TO THE ONE BEFORE. S. TO THE ONE BEFORE YOU TODAY. HOWEVER WHEN THE BILL REACHED THE GOVERNOR'S DESK IN THE FORM OF A SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM FOR. BODY PROTECTIVE GEAR IT WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED. AB SEVEN IS THE REINTRODUCTION OF THE SAME ADDRESS AND ADDRESS OF THE CONCERN POSED BY THE ADMINISTRATION. THOSE CONCERNS LACKED A LACK OF PROVISIONS REGULATING THE USE OF GEAR AND THAT EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THE SECURE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND WAS WITH MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WORKING IN THE M. S. I. AGREE. EMPLOYEE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS YEAR BUT THAT'S WORSE THE THOUGHT THIS UP THERE THEY AREN'T EVEN PROVIDED THE SCARE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE WAS ANOTHER MASS SHOOTING THIS PAST WEEK AND OUR PRESIDENT SAY THERE'S A GUN EPIDEMIC. AND YET OUR FIRST RESPONDERS DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE YOUR PROTECT HIMSELF ONCE BOND TO THESE EMERGENCIES. YOU MAY ASK WHY DOES THIS BILL ONLY APPLY TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THAT'S BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA OVER EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR MS EMPLOYEES. ARE EMPLOYED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. OVER SEVENTY SIX OF THE SENATE PLOYS. RUN THE STATE YOU MAY HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THIS GET YOUR IS NOT NECESSARY WHILE THEY BEGIN TO NATIONAL ROLL OUT THEIR OWN SUBSIDIZED PROGRAM FOR THE VERY SAME HERE THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE. EVERY NINE ONE ONE CALL THAT EMS RESPONSE TO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME A DANGEROUS SITUATION OFTENTIMES THERE ARE SO TO BY THE PEOPLE THEY ARE TRYING TO HELP. THE OCCUPATION OF AN EMT CAN BE DANGEROUS WITH THE HIGH RATES OF MORTALITY INJURY AND MENTAL AND PHYSICAL TRAUMA THIS IS ACCORDING TO A UCLA LABOR REPORT ON WORKING CONDITIONS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR EMS. MEMBERS I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION OF THIS% ADMINISTRATION ON ACHIEVING THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS BILL. THAT IS MAKE SURE THOSE WOULD COME TO OUR AID ARE WELL PROTECTED TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY TODAY THE SHELLEY HUDSON WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EMTS AND PARAMEDICS WHO SHOULD BE ON THE LINE THANK YOU SO MUCH- SHELLEY HUDDLES IN UP TO TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN EVERYBODY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN CARLA AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS SHELLY HOW OPEN AND I'M A NATIONAL LABOR REPRESENTATIVE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION. OF EMTS AND PARAMEDICS. I AM ALSO A LICENSED PARAMEDIC MYSELF. I AM SPEAKING HERE TODAY URGE YOUR SUPPORT IN PASSING A D. SEVEN. AND TO SHARE WHY I WITH MY PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AS A PARAMEDIC. BELIEVE THE MULTI THREATEN HERE THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE IS NECESSARY FOR OUR WORKFORCE. WHEN I WAS A YOUNG IS HE I WAS ON THE SCENE OF A LATE NIGHT CALL. I WAS STANDING WITH SEVERAL POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS IN FRONT OF A RESIDENTIAL HOME. ALL OF A SUDDEN WE NOTICED A RED BLAZER WITH SWEEPING ACROSS OUR CHAT. I WAS TOLD TO GET DOWN STAY DOWN BY THE OFFICERS WELL THEY PULLED THEIR GUNS TO PROTECT THE- FIND THE THREAT. IT WAS AT THAT MOMENT I REALIZED THAT I WAS THE TARGET. AND I HAD NO PROTECTION. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY. I GOT OFF WOK THE NEXT MORNING AND WENT DIRECTLY TO THE UNIFORMS STORE. AND BOUGHT A BULLET PROOF VEST. I COULDN'T AFFORD IT BUT MY LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT. THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WILL HAPPEN AND STILL OUR EMS WORKERS HAVE NO PROTECTION. IT MAY NOT BE AN EVERYDAY SITUATION BUT IT CAN HAPPEN AT ANY TIME. HOW LONG ARE WE GOING TO KEEP PLAYING RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH OUR LINE. SOME COMPANIES MAY HAVE A FEW WOULD BE THE BEST AND THEIR SUPERVISOR VEHICLES HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR THEM TO GET ON SCENE WHERE THEY ARE NEEDED. WILL IT BE TO WAIT. TILL THEY HAVE ENOUGH. MOST COMPANIES DON'T HAVE ANY. AS MASS SHOOTINGS HAVE INCREASED OVER THE YEARS AND MONTHS. NOW IS THE TIME DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER GIVE OUR EMS WORKERS SOME SENSE OF PROTECTION. LET THEM KNOW YOU HEAR THEM AND UNDERSTAND NAY NEED WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MAN RODRIGUEZ FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND CONTINUING TO FIGHT FOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE FIRST RESPONDERS. YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND I WILL CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS BY URGING THE COMMITTEE THE PAST EIGHTY SEVEN.

WELL MY CLIENT HAS A GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHORS YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE INDUSTRY THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT EVEN WELL INTENTIONED POLICY WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SERVICES. ON ITS FACE THIS WOULD BE AN EASY BILL THE SUPPORT HOWEVER THE DATA TEMPLATE DOES NOT SHOW THE NEED FOR BALLISTIC BODY ARMOR. IT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO FIFTEEN TWENTY PRACTICES DEFYING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND NOT. ENTERING HOT- I WOULD CALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO LOOK AT THOSE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THIS BILL IT SHOULD BE NOTICEABLE THAT WELL A MARKET IS A PRIVATE PROVIDER. ALMOST FORTY LARGELY UNIONIZED AND REPRESENTED BY ASKED ME WHO IS NOT TAKING A SUPPORT POSITION. IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THIS LEGISLATION HAS BEEN LIMITED TO ONLY PRIVATE PROVIDERS AND NOTHING BY TAKING REQUIREMENTS FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES DOES NOT EQUAL THE IMPORTANT. AND IS INSTEAD CARVED OUT OF THE BILL. SEVERAL LAWS FOR INDUSTRY OF FIRST RESPONDERS THAT PROVIDE THE SAME SERVICES CRAZY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT. ADDITIONALLY EIGHTY SEVEN ISRAEL BETTER WAY THAN WITH ALSO APPLIED TO DISPATCHERS NOT OUT IN THE FIELD OR ATHLETIC UNITS CAUSING UNNECESSARY DANGEROUS WHITE WEIGHT INCREASES.

ADD LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION FORWARD- THE NECESSITY FOR SAFETY EQUIPMENT LIKE THIS AS A GROWN OVER THE YEARS AND- IN ANSWER TO ONE OF THE QUESTION ARE- COMMENTS BY- I ONE OF THE- WITNESSES. PUBLIC SECTOR EMPLOYEE EMPLOYERS HAVE ACTUALLY MADE THIS A STANDARD ISSUE ITEM- WE CAN'T WE GET WHEN WE GET ON THE ON THE FORCE AND WE- WE TURN IT IN WHEN WE- WE DON'T WE LEAVE. AND YOU KNOW AND THEN THAT GETS RE USED IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A- SOMETHING THAT- THEY HAVE TO THEY KEEP BUYING. NEW EQUIPMENT ALL OF THE TIME. IT IS A COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

IF YOU'RE WORKING IN THIS INDUSTRY YOU WILL FIND TIMES WHEN- YOU CAN DO EVEN WHEN YOU DON'T EXPECT IT. LAND THIS IS MUCH NEEDED EQUIPMENT. AND SO- YOU KNOW I REALLY SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY AND- AND- HI I THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING. THAT IT DOES NEED TO BE EXTENDED INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR FROM THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TO PROTECT THOSE FOLKS AS WELL YOU KNOW THAT THE EMTS- ON THE AMBULANCE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT THE FIRST LINE MEDICS FOR WHATEVER AREA THEY'RE CONTRACTED FOR. AND SO THEY GO INTO SITUATIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE TOLD TO HOLD OFF A BLOCK AND A HALF. UNTIL THE SCENE IS SECURE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S A BLOCK AND A HALF AWAY- WITH YOU.

HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL BE BRIEF IF THE PART REQUIRED THERE WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON A. B. ELEVEN OH FIVE. THE COMPANY NINETEEN HAS PRESENTED INCREDIBLE AN UNFORESEEABLE CHALLENGES FOR ALL OF THAT AND HOSPITALS HAVE MET THE CHALLENGE TIME AND AGAIN BY TAKING CARE OF THE SICK AND KEEPING THEIR EMPLOYEES SAFE WITH. SIGN STATE INSPECTION CONTROL AND PROTECTION. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HOSPITALS HAVE FOLLOWED THE REGULATORY GUIDANCE FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT AND ALLOW THE LATEST SCIENTIFIC FINDINGS TO GUIDE ORGANIZATIONAL PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. UNFORTUNATELY ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN OH FIVE WOULD PREVENT HOSPITALS FROM CONTINUING THEIR INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO INFECTION CONTROL. IN ORDER TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IN THE HOSPITAL DECISION MAKING C. H. A. YEAH THE FOLLOWING AMENDMENT. PERMIT TAXABLE MATH IT SUPPORTED BY FINE AB ELEVEN OH FIVE WOULD REQUIRE ALL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WHERE MATH. ACTIVATE THE PERFECT PROFESSIONALS BACK IN STATUS WELL THAT IS CURRENTLY FOUND GUIDANCE HA BELIEVES THAT OUR MEMBERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADJUST THEIR MATH POLICY TO FUTURE GUIDANCE FROM THE AGENCY. FORTUNATELY H. THANK AB OH FIVE WOULD REQUIRE CLOSE THE NINETEEN TESTING OF EXPOSED HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL BUT IT DOESN'T SPECIFY THE EXPOSURE TIME LINE C. H. A. BELIEVE THAT AB ELEVEN OH FIVE SHOULD ALIGN WITH EXISTING LAW. IN FUTURE GUIDANCE INTENSIFIED THAT THE CODE NINETEEN EXPOSURE THAT TRIGGERED MANDATORY TESTING OF FIFTEEN MINUTES. OR MORE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. AB ELEVEN OH FIVE BUT ALSO REQUIRED THAT ALL PATIENTS BE TESTED PROPOSED NINETEEN BEFORE BEING ADMITTED. WE DO ASK THAT THERE BE SOME LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO THIS. VISION AND THEN LASTLY WE BELIEVE THAT- WE NEED TO ALIGN THE DURATION OF THESE REQUIREMENTS WITH EXISTING LAW. LAST YEAR EVERY BECAUSE THE NINETEEN BILLS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR HEADED SUNSET DATE OF JANUARY THE FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE HAS BEEN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE CONSTANTLY CHANGING NATURE OF THE VIRUS AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO IT. HM I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT HE BE ELEVEN OH FIVE BE BROUGHT INTO ALIGNMENT WITH EXISTING SUNSET DATE. TO PERMIT A HOLISTIC REVIEW. OF EXISTING CULVERT NINETEEN LAW.

YOU TAKE A LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. ANYONE IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. ELEVEN OH FIVE WILL GO TO THE PHONES- ANYONE IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONES TO AB ELEVEN OH FIVE. GIVEN OPPOSITION OF AB ELEVEN OH FIVE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO.

ONE OF ONE OF THOSE UNITS INTRODUCED A YEAR AGO- WITH URGENCY- DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE HELPED OUT IN IN IN- IN SOME SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY- OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS BUT- I'M GOING FOR I GUESS THE WHAT ONE CONCERN I HAVE IS YOU KNOW- ON THE ON THE COURSE OF ITS OWN RIGHT NOW IT WOULDN'T EVEN BE IN EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY. FIRST AND SO CERTAINLY TO THE- ONE OF THE POINTS RAISED ABOUT A SUNSET- AND I'M NOT SURE IF WE WANT TO YOU KNOW TRY TO. PICK OUT HARD AND FAST DATE AYE TYING INTO POSSIBLY YOU KNOW THE END OF THE DECLARATION OF A STATE OF EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING ELSE I THINK WOULD. PROVIDE CONCERNED BECAUSE- WE DEFINITELY WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING MEMORIALIZED IN CODE THAT'S REQUIRING UNNECESSARY TESTING- AND PROCEDURES SO ARE THESE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT WHEN YOU MENTION YOU WERE WORKING WITH THE CURRENT OPPOSITION ON SOME OF THE POINTS THERE CREEK TO APPARENTLY GO. ONE TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT MORE DETAILS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE BUT WE TALK ABOUT A SUNSET I THINK BECAUSE OF. WE'RE SEEING THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF- PROCREATION THE COPA NINETEENTH AND OTHER THINGS THAT MAKE MORALES SAID I THINK WOULD BE A ISSUE IF WE HAVE A SENSE OF BECAUSE WE NEED TO. BE PREPARED FOR THE FUTURE- BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE IN A YEAR FROM NOW OR TWO YEARS FROM NOW RIGHT IT IS VERY HARD WE DON'T WE DON'T AND HEAVEN FORBID THAT THAT DOESN'T THAT- THIS GETS BETTER PRESIDENT THAN WORSE THAT- BUT IT'S SITTING AT THE IT GETS BETTER- YOU KNOW AND THERE. THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF END POINT WHERE THIS IS NO LONGER AT THAT MAJOR RISK FOR THREAT- TO HAVE MEMORIALIZED CODE THAT. HAS THESE REQUIREMENTS AND- YOU KNOW JUST OPENED IT TO THINK ABOUT THAT THERE THERE MIGHT BE AN AND ACCEPT NEXANT MECHANISM A REASONABLE EXIT MECHANISM IN HERE- AND THEN YOU KNOW SEVERAL THE OTHER POINTS RAISED HERE TO WITHOUT. A PERMIT THAT PERMITTING FLEXIBLE MASKING- AND THEN YOU KNOW THAT I'M KIND OF WORKING WITH YOU KNOW SOME NARROW EXCEPTIONS ABOUT WHEN. A PATIENT IF THEY REFUSE TO TAKE A TEST OR THE THAN TONIGHT ALL HEALTH CARE- AND I THINK HE'D BE. DESERVES A REASONABLE THINGS THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE WORK ON SO IT'S SO YOU'RE COMMITTEE ARE GONNA CONTINUE WORK WEATHER PROBLEM THAT HUSTLES HE'S ON THAT OKAY THANKS HAVE WITHOUT WILL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY.

YOU KNOW PART TIME OF LIKE HOPE FOR THE BEST PAIR OF THE- WITH. THIS IS TAUGHT ALL. US ABOUT THAT. SO BUT I BUT I APPRECIATE- THE FACT YOU'LL BE WORKING. WITH THE OPPOSITION- AND ON SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS- BUT ULTIMATELY. I THINK THAT THOSE THAT WERE ASKING. TO BE ON THE FRONT LINE AND CONTINUE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINE- I THINK THAT- WE NEED TO. OFFER SOME OF THE BASIC PROTECTION. ARE INCLUDED TO THE PATIENTS ARE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. YOU KNOW I AND I THINK NOW THAT WE HAVE THESE OF THE RAPID TESTING YOU CAN TURN AROUND BY TEN MINUTES. AND ALLOW FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE REMITTED WHAT HAVE YOU SO- BUT IF THERE'S NEED FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY OR- WHAT HAVE YOU DOES THE CONVERSATION A MEASURE THAT WILL CONTINUE. AND SO WITH THAT.

EACH FOLDER THE SAME THING THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE AND SHARE THE STATUS IF THEY WERE OBLIGATED TO DO SO AND I'M HAPPY TO BE JOINED BY REPORTS MINT WHAT THE TRUCKER INSTITUTE. IT'S PART OF THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE WILL MOVE TO. OF AN. H. MISTER CHAIR NUMBER SEVEN YEAH I'M REPORTS NONE OF THE DRUCKER INSTITUTE A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE BASE TO CLAREMONT GRADUATE UNIVERSITY. AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY. THE MISSION OF THE DRUCKER INSTITUTE IS STRENGTHENING ORGANIZATIONS TO STRENGTHEN SOCIETY. AND IN THIS ROLE WE PRODUCE AN ANNUAL RANKING OF THE NATION'S BEST RUN COMPANIES FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND ACTIVELY CONSULT WITH THE CEOS OF SEVERAL MAJOR CORPORATIONS. IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE NOT STRANGERS TO THE BUSINESS WORLD AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE CONTROLLER MENTIONED IN THE CHAIR MENTIONED IS THAT CORPORATE AMERICA IS MOVING AND IN SOME CASES MOVING SWIFTLY. IN A DIRECTION THAT AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO WOULD TAKE US. FOR EXAMPLE THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS COUNCIL LED BY BANK OF AMERICA CEO BRIAN MOYNIHAN AS ISSUE THE STANDARDIZED DATA DRIVEN DISCLOSURE REGIME COVERING WAGES DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION A QUALITY ON PAY TRAINING AND HEALTH AND SAFETY. MORE THAN SIXTY COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO ADHERE TO THIS ARRANGEMENT INCLUDING SIDE TO BE A BIT OF A DELL TECHNOLOGIES IBM MASTERCARD PAYPAL AND SALESFORCE. A NUMBER OF COMPANIES MEANWHILE ARE ALREADY SHARING METRICS THAT WE DO THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER EIGHTY ELEVEN NINETY TWO. FOR INSTANCE HALF OF THE ONE HUNDRED LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES ON THE U. S. HAVE NOW AGREED TO FULLY DISCLOSE DATA ON THE RACIAL ETHNIC AND GENDER MAKE UP OF THEIR PROPOSALS. OTHERS ARE URGING EVEN MORE ACTION THE COALITION FOR INCLUSIVE CAPITALISM RECENTLY ISSUED A FRAMEWORK THAT CALLS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNIFORM AND MANDATORY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS EXACTLY WHAT'S PROPOSED IN AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO. ON WAGES AND BENEFITS WORKFORCE TURNOVER USE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND OTHER KEY INDICATORS. NOTABLY MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FRAMEWORK ARE THEMSELVES BUSINESS LEADERS TO INCLUDE A HALF DOZEN CORPORATE DIRECTORS AT TEXACO EXXON ALPHABET AND OTHER LARGE COMPANIES. THIS IS A UNIQUE. MOMENT IN HISTORY TO WALK THE TALK OPTICA MAKES. CAP MEASURABLE KLAUS SCHWAB THE CHAIR OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM HAS NOTED. AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO STANDS TO PUT THE STATE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS BROADER MOVEMENT WHILE MOST IMPORTANTLY ENCOURAGING THE CREATION OF HIGH QUALITY JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO OTHERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR A BI ELEVEN NINETY TWO IS THERE ANYONE.

THANK YOU DOUG BOCK WITH TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL SEVEN AND A MEMBER OF THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION. ADDING MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT NOW LET'S MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE ONE OPPOSITION WITNESS LISTED ACTUALLY HOFFMAN WHO IS WITH US ON THE PHONE TALKING ARE YOU WITH US. YES GOOD AFTERNOON GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS ACTUALLY HOW OFTEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY ELEVEN NINETY TWO IS A JOB KILLER- AS AMERICANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND IT DOESN'T CALIFORNIA VARYING SIZES I CAN ASSURE YOU THE BILL AS WRITTEN HAS EXTREME CONCERN BY THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO WILL BE USED TO UNFAIRLY PUBLIC SHAME PUBLISHING BUSINESS CENTRAL AWFUL MENTIONING THAT CONDUCT THEIR REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO REPORT DATA REGARDING WAGES BENEFITS SCHEDULING AND SAFETY WITH THE EXPLICIT INTENT OF USING THAT DATA TO COMPARE BUSINESSES TO ONE ANOTHER. THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL STATES THAT THE INTENT FOR THE DATA TO READ LIKE A NUTRITION LABEL LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD SEE AT THE GROCERY STORE TO COMPARE PRODUCTS. THE DATA WOULD THEN BE USED TO DETERMINE WHICH BUSINESSES SHOULD GET GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING THE DATA WOULD ALSO BE PUBLIC FOR THE WORLD TO SEE. AND THE BILL'S PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS FIRST BUSINESSES WILL BE HIT WITH LAWSUITS AND DEMAND LETTERS BASED ON DATA THAT HAS THE APPEARANCE OF A WAGE DISPARITY EVEN WE'RE NOT ACCEPT. A PRIOR BUILDING TWENTY SEVENTEEN WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE PUBLICATION OF DATA FROM EMPLOYERS ON THE WAGE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE EMPLOYEES. IN AN ARTICLE THAT YEAR IN THE SACRAMENTO BUSINESS JOURNAL OF SACRAMENTO AREA PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY THAT IS WELL KNOWN FOR CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. STATED IN THAT ARTICLE THAT BY POSTING THE DATA THE GOVERNMENT IS BASICALLY GIVING PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS THE DATA THY NEED TO GO IN THERE AD HAMMER COMPANIES HE AGREED HE WOULD ABSOLUTELY USE THAT DATA TO START SERVING DEMAND LETTERS AND LAWSUITS. EVEN IF THE BUSINESS OR TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THAT. THERE ARE LEGITIMATE REASONS FOR THE PLATE. FOR COMMERCIAL. THAT WOULD BE AFTER SO ABOUT THE OF DOLLARS DEPEND ON SUCH A CLAIM AND THAT. IT WAS VETOED IN PART DUE TO PER OF WHETHER. SECOND BUT THAT IT DOES NOT PROVIDED. REPRESENT OF HOW COMPANIES. AND EMPLOYER A MAJOR OF ITS EMPLOYEES. AND STATE THE FLOOR MINIMAL WASTE WATER AREAS WITH LOWER COST OF LIVING WILL HAVE LOWER PAY. AND IF THE STATE OR CITY THROUGH THE EMPLOYER IS LOCATED HAS A HIGHER NUMBER OF WOMEN OR RACIAL MINORITIES IN ITS WORKFORCE ANOTHER. AREA OF THE COUNTRY THAT WILL IMPACT AND SKEW THE DATA REPORTED. SO REALLY AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT USE THAT. EMPLOYERS WITH A LARGER WORKFORCE IN CALIFORNIA'S OBJECTION ABC TEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT STATISTICS. SENATE MCGUIRE BASED IN THE STATE THAT FOLLOWED FEDERAL LAW OR A DIFFERENT STANDARD. PROPONENTS OF THE BILLHAVE SAID THAT THE DATA COMPARISON IS NOT A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE COMPANIES WILL BE STORED IT IN. TWENTY FOUR INDUSTRY EXPERTS. HOWEVER THE TWENTY FOUR INDUSTRY GROUPS ARE QUITE BROAD INCLUDING CATEGORIES SUCH AS MATERIALS CAPITAL GOODS MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER SERVICES. EACH ONE INCOME THIS IS A WIDEVARIETY OF TYPES OF BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE IN MEDIAN ENTERTAINMENT COMPANIES THE DATA FOR A PRODUCTION COMPANY THAT REGULARLY USES DALY HIRES ARE BACK FOR PERFORMERS. HAD UNIQUE SCHEDULING NEEDS IS GOING TO LOOK SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM AN ADVERTISING AGENCY IN THAT SAME CATEGORY. IN CAPITAL GOODS COMPANIES ENGAGE IN AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE LOOK FAR DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT MANUFACTURE SMALLER MORE SPECIFIC PRODUCTS LIKE AN ELECTRIC WIRE OR A TRADING COMPANY. UNDER THIS BILL BOTH COMPANIES THAT COULD HAVE STATE BENEFITS ARE CONTRACTS WITH HELP FROM THEM. OR BE SHAMED IN NEWS HEADLINES OR LAWSUITS BASED ON AN APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISON THAT RESULT FROM THE PROPOSED METRICS. FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS WHO DO OPPOSE EIGHTY ELEVEN NINETY TWO THAT THE. JOCULAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO OTHERS IN OP TO CERTAIN HE AND HERE ROOM SITTING ANYWHERE THE REMOTE STATION. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES PLEASE FOR THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE OPPOSITION TO AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO I MEAN WE ARE TAKING NAME AFFILIATION AND THAT THEY ARE OPPOSED TO AB ELEVEN NINETY TWO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRPERSON. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE ELEVEN NINETY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. FIRST ONE GUIDELINE NUMBER TWO NINETY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS KATIE HANSON WITH A CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. THANKS WATER LINE NUMBER TWENTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU. NOW WE'RE GONNA LINE NUMBER TWO EIGHTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON THIS IS LORD TODAY NO GAP THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY SOCIAL WE'RE IN OPPOSITION. AND ONCE AGAIN LAYS GERMAN IF YOUR OPPOSITION AB ONE ONE NINE TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIRPERSON WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU OPERATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES FOR A BI ELEVEN NINETY TWO OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I HAVE WITH A SERRA. THANK A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE WITNESSES- ONE OF THE PRIMARY WITNESSES SAID THE CORPORATE AMERICA IS MOVING SWIFTLY TOWARDS DOING WHAT'S ALREADY IN THIS BILL. SO I'VE DONE A PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS MOVING SWIFTLY TOWARDS DOING THAT WHY DO YOU NEED A BILL. IT'S INTERESTING THAT. IT COMES OUT WELL I THINK A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS FOR UNIFORMITY ONE IS. BUT IT DEFINITELY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA THAT WE AND AGAIN THIS IS COMING OUT OF- OVER YOUR LONG. PARTICIPATION IN THE FUTURE WORK COMMISSION AS ONE OF THE KIND OF THE GOALS OF THE COMMISSION. AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT. MANNERS IN WHICH CORPORATE AMERICA THEY MAY BE LOOKING AT ONE ASPECT OF THE OTHER THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A UNIFORM STANDARD. IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY HAVE A JOB QUALITY INDEX THAT INDICATES A RECRUITING GOOD QUALITY JOBS. AND SO- WITH THE THAT'S- THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE WANT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR LOOKED AT THAT AND I GOT TO GIVE CREDIT TO STATE CONTROLLER BUT HE'S HER TEAM AND PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIZATION OF WHAT DATA IS IMPORTANT. AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT SECTORS AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF BUSINESS LEADERS AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS TO DETERMINE WHAT THOSE CRITERIA AND CATEGORIES SHOULD BE AND I THINK HAVING SOMETHING UNIFORMS FAR- THAT IS A USEFUL WELL FOR US AS A STATE IN TERMS OF ELEVATING HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS- IT IS WHAT MATTERS THE MOST I THINK AS A- AS A STATE LEGISLATOR AS A IN TERMS OF PUTTING PART OF POLICY SO YES ARE THERE THINGS HAPPENING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR ABSOLUTELY OF THAT REALLY INDICATES. THE FACT THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT THAT THIS INFORMATION AND- DOES MATTER BUT THERE'S NOT A UNIFORM STANDARD THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS CREATE ONE THAT MAKES SENSE OF WORSHIP CALIFORNIA RIGHT WELL MIGHT NOT WORK FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S WHY SOME CORPORATIONS ARE MOVING TOWARDS THAT AND SUMMER LAGGING BEHIND BECAUSE THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AND CREATING THIS UNIFORM STANDARD IN A BILL THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO DO IT- FORCES THEM INTO TERRITORY THAT THEY'RE NOT READY TO BE ABLE TO- TO PARTICIPATE IN. AND SO THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE IS I HEARD SEVERAL TIMES THIS IS ENCOURAGING HIGH PAYING JOBS HOW DOES ADVERTISING HOW DIFFICULT IT IS AND HOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO THE WORLD CREATE HIGH PAYING JOBS WHEN THAT WOULD DISCOURAGE ANYBODY FROM SETTING UP A CORPORATION HERE WELL I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT CONTENTION BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THIS IS JUST REQUIRING PUBLISHING INFORMATION- OF THAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THESE COMPANIES FOR THE MOST PART. OF A THOUSAND MORE EMPLOYEES RIGHT- HAVE THIS DATA AND TO MAKE IT ACCESSIBLE- MY AT THE END OF THE DAY- IS THAT THE REALITY IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE DONE WELL IN. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY WELL IN CALIFORNIA WE WILL TO MAKE SURE THE AND- AS THEY'RE DOING- CAN IN- HOW THERE'S- IS ALSO TRYING. TO HIGH QUALITY- AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE- OF. A JOB AND THIS WAS NATURE. I WOULD DO AND THE REALITY IS THAT LOOK I MEAN A LOT OF THE FOLKS THAT MAY BE. HAVING SOME CONCERNS IN OPPOSITION- I HAD MEMBERS ON THIS COMMISSION. YOU KNOW THEY WERE PART OF SETTING FORTH THIS IS ONE OF THE GOALS- THE COMING OUT OF THE COMMISSION. AND SO. ULTIMATELY I THINK AT LEAST IN THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION. WE WERE ALL IN AGREEMENT. THAT CREATING HIGHER QUALITY JOBS IMPORTANT GOAL FOR THE FUTURE OF WORK IN CALIFORNIA HI. SO IF YOU'RE IN TEXAS AND YOU'RE COMPETING WITH CALIFORNIA TO BRING IN A PLAYER A LARGE EMPLOYER- THAT HAS A LOT OF WELL PAYING JOBS. AND CALIFORNIA LET YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE COMPETING. AGAINST YOUR TEXAS AND YOU DON'T. WELL GUESS WHAT. TEXAS WINDS. AND THEY'RE WINNING A LOT. FROM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SIR FOR. YOURSELF WHY DID WE EXEMPT THE PUBLIC SECTOR HELLO THIS. HI MICHAEL I CAN ALLOW THE CONTROLLER TO SPEAK TO THAT BUT- THE REALITY IS THAT A LOT OF THE- PUBLIC SECTOR INFORMATION INCLUDING OUR OWN. SALARIES ARE. PUBLICLY DISPOSABLE- AND ANOTHER SET BACK I CAN I CAN SPEAK TO THAT MR OUR PERHAPS YES PLEASE MONITOR ABOUT OFFICIALS AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR- MOST OF THEM BECAUSE OF THE FIRST OF THOSE WAS REALLY TO TIE. UP THE REPORTING OF THE STANDARDS THAT SET OF DATA ON THE- ON STATE SPENDING SO IN OTHER WORDS TO LOOK AT HOW WE COULD NOT. HAVE THE IMPROVEMENT OF CONDITIONS FOR WORKERS THAT- WOULD BE INCENTIVIZED THROUGH THE STATE SPENDING SO. THAT'S MOSTLY WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICULARLY HAS REPLACED IS. NOT DIVERTED BE DIRECTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO A LARGE SCALE INITIATIVES- BUT- RESPECT INSPITE ENERGY TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER OTHER OTHER AREAS AS WELL- YOU KNOW I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE. THAT- FEEL ABOUT THAT. TEKHELET SERVER IN THE BILL ARE REALLY WORK FORM A SURVEY BUT BUSINESS CAN. AND UP BEING ALMOST SEE. THAT THE WERE THE BEST THAT UP OR WERE EASY INITIALLY- OKAY FOR REPORTED AND KEPT TRACK OF BY- BY COMPANIES AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SO OF THESE WERE NOT INVENTED OUT OF THIN AIR. I THINK THERE'S A CONSENSUS AROUND IS THAT TRICKS BEING READILY. AVAILABLE BY COMPANIES. SO THE PUBLIC SECTOR- BECAUSE THEIR DATA IS PUBLISHED THEY WOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE. I MEAN UP A PRIVATE ATTORNEY CAN COME NTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SCOOT AND SUE SOMEBODY FOR PAY DISCREPANCY CORRECT. BECAUSE THERE'S MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAVE HAD BILLS. TO ALLOW OUR STAFF TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN BECAUSE OF THE DISCREPANCY. WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR INSTITUTION. SO MY FRUSTRATION ONCE AGAIN AS WE CONTINUE. TO HAMMER THE PRIVATE SECTOR WITH ALL OF THESE RULES BUT WE DON'T CONTINUE TO FALL IN OUR OWN HOUSE. THERE'S A MASSIVE DISCREPANCY. WITHIN STAFF PAY IN THIS BUILDING WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT. DOES THIS EXAMPLE STATE FROM BEING SUED FOR PAY DISCREPANCIES. I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT NO BECAUSE ALL THAT INFORMATION IS PUBLIC AND IF ATTORNEYS WERE GOING TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION TO SUE THE STATE ALL THAT DATA IS READILY AVAILABLE SO THEN WHY IS IT REMOVAL FOR PRIVATE BUSINESS IF THEY PUBLISH ALL OF THIS. THE WHITE OF THE WISER PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TO THIS. IF THEY CAN SUIT A PRIVATE BUSINESS FOR THIS BUT THEY CAN'T SEE THE STATE. WHAT AM I MISSING. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION WAS THE AVAILABILITY OF DATA FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES YES THAT IS AVAILABLE AND IF SOMEONE WERE. WANTED TO BUILD A SUIT AROUND THAT. THEY CERTAINLY COULD. SO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. AVAILABLE FOR LITIGATION OVER PAY DISCREPANCY. EVEN THOUGH IT'S PUBLISHED. BECAUSE IT IS AVAILABLE IF SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE THAT CASE THEY COULD TAKE THAT DATA AND BUILD A CASE THERE'S NOTHING THAT PREVENTS THAT. OKAY THANK YOU. THE DALLAS. WE DO HAVE PROVISIONS EQUAL PAY ACT THAT. WOULD ALLOW FOR THAT IN I. S. AS SOMEBODY WHO WROTE A BILL AND REFERRED AT THIS TIME AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THE TO PROVIDE OUR STAFF WITH A VERY IMPORTANT REAL. OPPORTUNITY TO ORGANIZE INTO A UNION- I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. I OTHER PEOPLE MAY RENT BILLS FOR OTHER REASONS BUT THAT DID NOT HAVE TO DO WITH THE PAY DISPARITY BECAUSE UNDER THIS- SPEAKER WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A MALE AND FEMALE I THINK IT'S DOWN TO LIKE 2% OR SOMETHING INCREDIBLE COMPARED TO ANYTHING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR SO- WE- WE SUFFER MANY. BILLS IN THIS BUILDING ESPECIALLY TOWARDS OUR EMPLOYEES AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT WE DON'T- WE DON'T FOLLOW ALL THE RULES. OF LABOR LINE I FIND THAT OFFENSIVE. BUT- IN THIS PROVISION. ALL OF OUR STAFF- INFORMATION ANY ANY EMPLOYEE THE STATE CALIFORNIA YOU CAN GOOGLE IT AND FIND IT ONLINE I MEAN THERE'S A WHOLE WEBSITE FOR ITSELF- IT'S READILY AVAILABLE ARE READY THE STRESS. I LOVE OUR CONVERSATION ABSENT BUT ON THAT NOTE LIKE WE MAY NOT HAVE A PAY DISCREPANCY BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE A STAFFING DISCREPANCY. SO IF THERE'S A WORKLOAD ISSUE IF WE ARE ASKING CERTAIN MEMBERS IN CERTAIN OFFICES TO DO THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK THAN OTHER MEMBERS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER STAFFS. THERE IS A DISCREPANCY. AND I COULD. GIVE ENTERED ARE YOU A PAY DISCREPANCY AS WELL BUT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M WHERE DO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE I MEAN I HANDLE. MY DISTRICT OFFICE I DON'T AND WE DON'T EVEN TO THIS NOW WITH MY DISTRICT OFFICES HANDLE AS MANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT EDT FROM THE REPUBLICANS IN MY DISTRICT GRANTED THEY MIGHT BE MORE UNDERSTAFFED BUT THE WORKLOAD IS DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT OFFICES AND THAT IS NOT BY ITSELF. A. F. A VIOLATION OF ANY KIND OF. RIGHT TO HAVE STAFF BUT I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S JUST THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO THIS. PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ELICIT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN ORDER TO DETERMINE. WHO WHO'S DOING A GOOD JOB. SADLY A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE DO AND IN THIS BUILDING NEVER APPLIES TO US. I UNDERSTAND BUT- THIS IS SEEKING DATA THE DATA IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. IS AVAILABLE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR QUITE SOME TIME OTHER QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU LOOK THIS IS ABOUT- FOR THE METRICS ABOUT GETTING INFORMATION AND IN THE PUBLIC OF MOBILE REGARDING. AGAIN AS OUR STATE CONTROL INDICATED THE METRICS THAT WERE PUT TOGETHER WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT THEY ARE THAT WOULD BE OVERLY BURDENSOME ON THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THESE ARE TYPICAL PIECES OF INFORMATION THAT THEY ALREADY COLLECT. I AND THAT THE IDEA IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY CREATE A HIGH ROAD EMPLOYER PROGRAM THAT QUALIFIES FOR INCENTIVES SO IT'S A WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. THE OF THE STATE RESOURCES IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT STATE RESOURCES- IN TO. YOU KNOW PULL INTO ANY KIND OF- WORK THAT'S BEING DONE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE WE MUST TO CHANNEL THOSE RESOURCES TO HIGH ROAD EMPLOYERS AND SO THIS AGAIN IS THE WORD THAT CAME OUT OF THE COMMISSION- THAT- IT IS REALLY FOCUSED ON. GETTING THE DATA THAT'S READILY AVAILABLE FIRST OF AVAILABLE BEFORE WE EVEN GO DOWN THE STEPS OF CREATING A HIGH ROAD EMPLOYER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS OF THIS IS THE CRITICAL FOUNDATIONAL PIECE FOR IT. THEN AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR STATE CONTROLLER BETTY YEE AND HER TEAM WILL PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK INTO THIS AS WELL AS MY OWN STAFF. AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN- PART OF THIS JOURNEY FIVE MEN TO GET US HERE. ON BEHALF OF A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE GET THE GOVERNOR'S COMMISSION THAT I SERVED ALONG WITH THE STATE WAS TO CONTROL HE AND DOUG BAKU SPOKEN OTHERS AND AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS CAN DO THAT WERE ALSO ON THAT COMMISSION. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK. YOU MISTER CHAIR I AM LOOKING FOR A MOTION. DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU I WILL SECOND THAT SECOND OKAY THANK YOU WE DO A MOTION BY MISTER WARD AND SECOND BY MISS GONZALEZ AND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU. KALRA PLEASE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA FIVE KALRA HI FLORA FLORA NO GONZALEZ RIGHT GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER STONE HI STONE I DON'T KNOW DON'T KNOW WARD WARD I. FELT THE BILL THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SUMMER STONE. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES FOR THE DIALOGUE ON THAT AND SO WE WILL MOVE BACK UP IN ORDER- AND WE HAVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. OKAY ITEM ELEVEN WHICH IS AB SIX SIXTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB SIX ONE SIX IS A BILL THAT IS VERY TIMELY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES AN OPTION FOR FARMWORKERS TO CAST VOTES IN SIMILAR WAYS THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED FOR THE STATE AND THAT IS BY MAIL SO THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS THAT COULD HAPPEN. FOR FARMWORKERS. ORGANIZATIONAL TYPE ELECTIONS AND THAT THE CURRENT ONE IS MORE LIKE IN A POLLING PLACES WE WOULD UNDERSTAND IT AND THE SECOND WOULD BE THE WHAT WE'RE CREATING HERE IS AN OPERA BY. A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WE ARE PROTECTING THE- SECURITY AND THE SECRECY OF THE BALLOTS AS WELL WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT UNDER THIS CONTEXT. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ENSURE THAT ALL THE FARMWORKERS HAVE READY ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CAST THAT BALLOT. AND WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MAIL IN BALLOTS AND HOW THAT SYSTEM WORKS AND HOW IT IS PROTECTIVE OF THE RIGHT TO VOTE. AND ENSURES A FAIR AND EQUITABLE OUTCOME. SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE PROPOSING THAT IN THIS CASE. BECAUSE THIS IS A SOMETIMES A DIFFICULT POPULATION TO REACH ENSURING THAT THEY HAVE A FAIR WAY TO BE ABLE TO VOTE WHETHER TO THE POLLING PLACE OR BY THIS BILL ALSO THE OPTION. OF DOING VOTE BY MAIL. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE HERE SO THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES TERESA ROMERO PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. AND MARIO MARTINEZ WHO IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF A TO THE TRANSFER AMERILA IS ON THE PHONE SHE MAY BEGIN UP TO TWO MINUTES AND WE ALSO HAVE A MARIO MARTINEZ I BELIEVE PROTECTING QUESTIONS AS INDICATED BY. SUMMER STONE SO- MAYBE I'M- YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON. AGAIN MY NAME IS THAT IT SACRAMENTO AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED FARM WORKERS. UNDER THEIR CORPORATE LABOR RELATIONS ACT WHICH WAS ENACTED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. FARM WORKER UNION REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS. ARE CONDUCTED THE WAY POLITICAL ELECTIONS WERE CONDUCTED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE. PERSON AT A PHYSICAL PART IN PLACE. SINCE THEN THE WEIGHT CALIFORNIA CONDUCTED ELECTIONS PRODUCTS IT HAS EVOLVED AND CHANGED IN ORDER TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION. REGISTERING TO VOTE IS. BIG TIME EVERYONE HAS TO VOTE HAS INCREASED BORDERS AND ALLOW SOME OUT SOMEONE ELSE TO TURNING THEIR BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA'S NEW VOTING CHOICE ACT HAS CREATED OPTIONS FOR HOW PEOPLE CAN CAST THEIR BALLOTS. GOVERNING MUSEUM HAS STATE AND I QUOTE I THINK MAKING VOTER EACH YEAR PROVIDING MORE CHOICE AND MORE OPPORTUNITY IT'S- AND QUOTES WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARK STONE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON EIGHTY SIX ONE SIX. REPORTER LABOR RELATIONS VOTING CHOICE ACT REPORTS FARMWORKERS TIM MILLER OPPORTUNITIES TO VOTE ARE IN UNION REPRESENTATION ELECTIONS. WELL BALLOTS WILL REMAIN SECRET FARMWORKERS WILL HAVE A CHOICE IN VOTING AT A PHYSICAL PUTTING PLACE AS THEY DO NOW. OR THEY CAN FILL. OUT THE PRESENTATION BALLOT CARDS. HE DAVID DAVIS TONYA FINDING CAN FEEL OUT THE CARD THE PURSE QUITS. COSTS SIGNIFICANT BALLOT CARD AND THE BALLOT CARD IS RETURNED TO THE AREA MIGHT BE IN A- FIELD IN SIGNED INTO LAW. JUST AS WE'VE DONE FROM ARE RIGHT NOW. FOR OUR BORDERS ELECTING YOU. SENATOR ALEX THE GIVEN YOU THE CLIP. ALLEGES WHEN HE WAS SECRETARY OF THE STATE AND HE SUPPORTS THE EFFORT TO ALLOW FARMWORKERS TO PARTICIPATE. IN DECIDING THEIR FUTURES THREE FOUR EIGHT NINE S. FORM A VOTE SUPPRESSION.

THANK YOU REEE BAYARDO WITH AT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU WILL GET A LINE OF TWO SIXTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

HI MY NAME IS SENDING CHAU WILLIAMS AND I SUPPORT AB THROUGH THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THREE POINT. MEXICO LINE OF TWO EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. TWO EIGHTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER SUPPORT QUEUE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE MATTHEW ALLEN AS WELL AS ASHLEY HOFFMAN ON THE PHONE IN OPPOSITION SO IF YOU CAN BE CHEEKY JAB UP TO TWO MINUTES AND YOU MAY BEGIN- MATTHEW ALLEN- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MATTHEW ON WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB- SIX ONE SIX- THE PURPOSE AND INTENT OF THE ADLAI RELATIONS ACT IS TO GUARANTEE THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS FREE CHOICE WITH RESPECT TO UNION REPRESENTATION THROUGH. THE EXISTING SECRET BALLOT ELECTIONS THAT HELD AT A TIME AND PLACE CONVENIENT TO THE EMPLOYEES AND IT IS UNDER THE DIRECT SUPERVISION OF THE AD LABOR RELATIONS. BOARD AB SIX ONE SIX WATER ROAD THIS GUARANTEE AND SEVERAL A CRITICAL WAYS AND IT RAISES THE RISK THAT UNION REPRESENTATION. AND THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FROM PLACE TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY DUES AND OBEY UNION RULES- COULD BE IMPOSED. I WENT EMPLOYEES I DO NOT WISH TO HAVE UNION REPRESENTATION- SIGNING AN OPERATION AUTHORIZATION COR CARD- IS AN INDICATION OF POSSIBLE INTEREST IN UNION REPRESENTATION TRIGGERS A PROCESS WHEREBY THE L. R. B. CAN SUPERVISE A SECRET BALLOT ELECTION. BUT IS NOT BY ANY MEANS THAT- THE- DISCERNING OF A DESIRE FOR THE UNION REPRESENTATION AMONG THE MEMBERS OF THE POSSIBLE BARGAINING. DYSTER AND COLLECTION OF THE SIGNED AUTHORIZATION CARDS IS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY MEANINGFUL SUPERVISION OR SCRUTINY FROM ANY AGENCY- THE DECISIONS AS AN OPPOSITION CAR OR VOTE FOR UNION REPRESENTATION IS NOT OF EQUAL WEIGHT OR VALIDITY WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY THE A. L. R. A. HAS ENSURED. THAT SECRET ABOUT ELECTIONS ARE THE EXCLUSIVE MEANS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE UNION. AND EMPLOYEE- IT'S FREE TO VOTE THEIR CONSCIENCE IN A SECRET BALLOT ELECTIONS WHERE NEITHER THE EMPLOYER NOR THE UNION- BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A FINANCIAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME- CAN INFLUENCE OR OBSERVE- THEIR VOTE. I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO MENTION FINALLY THAT THE BONDING REQUIREMENT THAT'S PRESENT IN THE BILL ALSO REPRESENTS A DIRECT THREAT TO. EMPLOYERS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS- AB SIX ONE SIX WOULD PLACE A STEEP HURDLE IN FRONT EMPLOYER WITH AN ESSENTIALLY STATE THAT THE EMPLOYER IS NOT ALLOWED. TO APPEAL OR EXERCISE THEIR DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. I'M NOT THE BOND IS POSTED IN AN AMOUNT AND AT THE TERM AND BY THE ENFORCING AGENCY. AGENCY AND THAT IS THE L. R. B. R. THE AYLER B. IS NOT A NEUTRAL PARTY IN THIS CONTEXT AND IS AN INHERENTLY PART PREJUDICIAL INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEAL. IT IS FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND MORE THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- AND ASHLEY HOFFMAN. THANK YOU. KERR MEMBERS ACTUALLY HAPPEN- ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN OPPOSITION TO EIGHTY SIX POINT SIX AS A JOB KILLER. AND UNDOUBTEDLY BOTH SIDES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL MISCONDUCT WHEN IT COMES TO UNION ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT THEY ARE B. AND L. RB HAVE SPECIAL WILL BE BASICALLY TO ELIMINATE LAST MINUTE PRESSURE ELECTION HEARING. IT FOR THAT REASON THAT THE PEOPLE ABOUT PROFITS HAS BEEN LONG SUPPORTED BY THE NLRB AND OTHERS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT IS TRULY THE MOST ACCURATE REFLECTION OF AN EMPLOYER. AND EMPLOYEE USED A FIRE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO UNIONIZE WE ARE AFRAID THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY DESTROY THOSE PROTECTIONS. THERE ARE REPORTS OF COURSE IT IS AND IF WE CAN CONDUCT THAT OCCUR IN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS IN DECISIONS BY THE A. R. B. AND R. B. AND BY COURT. THAT CONDUCT INCLUDES EMPLOYEES OR UNION REPRESENTATIVES PRESSURING EMPLOYEES TO SIGN PETITION CARDS SAYING THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR JOB. OTHER DOCUMENTED CONDUCT INCLUDES MISINFORMATION SUCH DISTURBING WRITTEN MATERIAL- WITH CALLS THAT WERE NEVER STATED BY OTHER EMPLOYEES OR WITHOUT EMPLOYEES NOTICED THAT THEIR NAMES ARE BEING PLACED ON A FIRE. EVEN JUST PUTTING THAT MORE SERIOUS KIND OF THE SITE IS ALSO JUST NATURALLY MORE DIFFICULT TO TAKE A POSITION CONTRARY TO THE PERSON STANDING BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO FIND A CARD THAT THEY FILLED OUT FOR YOU. SHE WAS NOT PERSON MAYBE A CO WORKER SOMEONE POSITION OF POWER. THE SECRET BALLOT INSURANCE EMPLOYEE HAS THE ABILITY TO CAPTURE BUT WITHOUT THAT SAME PRESSURE AND GIVE THEM THE- ABILITY TO KEEP THEIR- SECRET IF THEY SO WISH. AND IF THIS NEW PROCEDURE IS TRULY BETTER IT'S UNCLEAR WHY THE BILL WOULD NOT PROVIDE MEETING PROCEDURE WHEN IT COMES TO. DECERTIFYING UNION- THE RETALIATION PRESUMPTION IS ALSO CONCERNING TO OUR MEMBERS THE BILL HAS A PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION WHERE AN EMPLOYER DISCIPLINES ARE TERMINATE AN EMPLOYEE DURING A BALLOT CARD CAMPAIGN. AND FUNDING OF AN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION IS ALREADY TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN RETALIATION CLAIM. FURTHER AT THIS PRODUCTION EFFECTIVELY UNLIMITED AT THE TIME I CAMPAIGN COULD CONCEIVABLY GO ON FOR MONTHS AND INDEED THE BALLOT CARD AND THAT THE STATE WOULD BE VALID FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. TO BASICALLY ANY. DISCIPLINARY ACTION TAKEN BY AN EMPLOYEE DURING THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS. THAT AN EMPLOYER HAVE TO OVERCOME BY CONDEMN. IN OVERWHELMING. WHICH IS AN EXTRA. HIGH BRINGS. AN EMPLOYMENT. EMPLOYERS SHOULD HAVE TO. THE FOR TWO YOU SIMPLE. FOR EVERY PERSON TAX. TAKEN DURING A GIVEN YEAR. I FOR THE REASONS WE OPPOSE SB SIX ONE SIX. THANK THANK YOU IS THERE A- ONE IN THE MORNING ROOM NOT- GO TO THE PHONE. ANYWHERE ON THE PHONE AND OPPOSITE. TO ABC ONE SO. THANK YOU IF YOU'RE NOT.OF EIGHT. SIX ONE SIX YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE WILL GO TO LINE UP TO EIGHTY THEY DROPPED OUT THIS ONE TIME ONE AND THEN ZERO FOUR GO TO LINE THREE ALL THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN.

GOOD AFTERNOON KAREN MEMBERS HASN'T TURNED OUR WITH AGRICULTURAL COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEXICO LINE OF TWENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN LITTLE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR HERE ISN'T ON THE TABLE DOES ANYONE. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SOME OF HIS HOUSE. I WAS JUST THINKING AM PROUD TO BE A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THIS IT'S IMPORTANT POINT BILL AT JUST TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE MOST CONVENIENT AND SAFE WAY FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS BUT IT'S STRANGE TO HEAR THE KIND OF- THE WARNINGS I SUPPOSE BY THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE JUST THIS MORNING I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS MY- THE NINETEEN SCHOOLS. IN MY- MY CHILDREN'S CHARTER SCHOOL COLLABORATIVE- YOU KNOW DURING THE PANDEMIC THAT THE TEACHERS- ON THEIR OWN THE EMPLOYEES WENT AND GOT SIGNATURES TO FILE A PETITION. IN BECAUSE THE RULES AND PER WHICH IS ALSO CALIFORNIA RELATED THING THEY WILL GET UNION RECOGNITION FROM. SIMPLY TURNING IN A PETITION WITH YOU KNOW. EMPLOYEES AT WHO WANT TO JOIN THE UNION AND WE BELIEVE THAT PUBLIC EMPLOYEES ESPECIALLY TEACHERS HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES THAT THAT IS SUFFICIENT- AND YET SOMEHOW. THIS IS ACTUALLY MORE STRINGENT RUBIO THAT IS WHAT IT WOULD STILL BE HAPPENING UNDER THE L. R. B. SOMEHOW IS NOT- I. I THINK THAT INADEQUATE I THINK THOSE INEQUITIES THERE ARE STRIKING AND ONE OF THE REASONS PROBABLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN- SUCH AS- BARRIERS TO POOR MEAN- FOR WORKERS TO FEEL SAFE FORMING A UNION AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY SELF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS THIS MAKES SENSE WITH VOTE BY MAIL WE DO THIS OFTEN YOU CAN HAVE SOMEBODY HELP YOU DO IT AND IT MAKES SENSE THAT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO IT FORMALLY. AS THE UNION AS WELL. THANK THANK YOU THE BILL THE SOMERSET SIR AND I'M GOING TO TAKE OUT ALL THE STUFF WE'VE HEARD AND GO STRAIGHT TO KIND OF PRACTICAL EVERYDAY THING I WAS A MEMBER OF A UNION FOR MANY MANY YEARS ONE OF THE BEST UNIONS IN THE STATE. AND WE ALWAYS GOT OUR BALLOTS WE ALWAYS VOTED. AND FRANKLY AS A SUPERVISOR AT TIMES AND THERE WAS STILL BECAUSE WE WERE UNION UP UNTIL WE'RE BATTALION CHIEF. AND AS A SUPERVISOR IN CAPTAIN. FRANKLY I WOULDN'T WANT TO KNOW IF THE GUY NEXT TO ME IT WASN'T. DIDN'T VOTE FOR BEING IN A UNION OR NOT- AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE THERE IS GOING TO BE A BIAS. IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE UNION AND SOMEBODY NEXT TO YOU. WAS PARTICIPATING IN A IN A BALLOT THAT WE KNEW WHAT HE DID. AND NOT ONLY THAT BAD FOR HIM. BUT THAT'S BAD FOR US TO. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE CURRENT PROCESS. IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO WORK ESPECIALLY FOR UNIONS BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CONTROL GROUP THIS ISN'T LIKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS A CONTROLLED GROUP. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO. GET A BALLOT IN PHILADELPHIA WITHOUT SOMEBODY STANDING IN FRONT OF THEM. WATCHING WHAT'S GOING ON OR GIVING THEM A PRE FILLED BALANCING HEY MAKE SURE YOU SIGN THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO. NO MATTER HOW THEY FEEL. AND IT FOR UNIONS GOOD ENOUGH. THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO SIGN UP. BUT MAYBE THAT'S A THEIR REPORT CARD AND THANK YOU FOR. BUT MAYBE THAT'S THEIR REPORT CARD. IS IF THEY IF THEY HAVE THEIR BALLOT FOR UNIONIZING AND IT ISN'T THERE YET. MAYBE THEY NEED TO DO MORE TO BE ABLE TO GET PEOPLE ON BOARD. BUT I DON'T THINK CREATING A COERCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE. IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF ANY WORKER. SO THAT'S WHY I'M OPPOSED TO. THANK YOU. A SUMMER WAR DIGITAL. I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- DOING THIS BILL I RECOGNIZE IT'S A STRAIGHTFORWARD OBVIOUS AND NOT IMPORTANT AND HAPPY THAT A CO AUTHOR OF THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A RESULT I'M ALSO. PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS. BILL I THINK THAT- AS WE'VE SEEN. OF IT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MAIL IN BALLOTS. AS WELL AS THE NATURE OF THE WORK THAT OUR CULTURAL WORKERS I THINK THAT- THIS ADDS- IF YOU CAN IMPORTANT COMPONENT TO ENSURE THAT. ELECTIONS ARE FREE AND FAIR AND ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE AND SO WITH THAT- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WOULD THANK YOU I I'M A LITTLE ASTONISHED AT THE OPPOSITION CREATING THIS THIS SPECTER. THAT WHAT THIS REPRESENTS IS SOMETHING LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS GOING TO BE HANDING A PRE FILLED OUT BALLOT. OR STANDING IN FRONT OF SOMEONE THIS IS JUST LIKE OUR BALLOTS. THIS WOULD CREATE A PROCESS WHERE SOMEONE CAN GO TO A POLLING PLACE AS WE DO NORMALLY OR OR AS IS EXISTENCE UNDER THE CURRENT CODE. FOR ASK FOR A MAIL IN BALLOT THAT WOULD BE MAILED TO THEM THAT THEY FILL IT OUT AND SEND IT BACK IN. WE HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS THAT IF SOMEONE IS HAS ASSISTING. THE INDIVIDUAL CASTING THE BALLOT THAT THEY- INDICATE THAT ON THE BALLOT TO SO THAT WE KNOW SOMEONE WAS ASSISTING. BUT WHY THE ASSUMPTION THAT THAT GUARANTEES THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO SAY A FOLKS STANDING OVER. AN INDIVIDUAL SAYING THIS IS HOW YOU'RE SIGNING IT I'M FILLING YOUR BALLOT OUT IS JUST A LITTLE BIT. BEYOND THE PALE. BECAUSE NOBODY DOES THAT WHEN I VOTE. I RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL AND I SENT IT AND WERE USED TO THAT AND WE HAVE. GOTTEN A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE MAIL IN BALLOT PROCESS WE'RE JUST CREATING A PROCESS HERE. THAT INDIVIDUAL. FOR A UNION ELECTION COULD ASK TO RECEIVE A MAIL BALLOT AND THEN MAIL IT IN. TO THE- A RP. WHO HAVE OBLIGATIONS AND THIS BILL TO KEEP IT SECRET. SO THE SECRECY PROVISIONS STILL APPLY THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S GOING TO BE LEAKED THERE'S NOTHING THAT THAT THAT IS GOING TO. TO BREACH THAT OBLIGATION BECAUSE WE DO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE FACT THAT THESE ARE SECRET BALLOTS. WHO SO. THE LETTER HYPERBOLE AROUND THIS IT'S A SIMPLE PROCESS I ASKED HER ABOUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MADAM SECRETARY WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION FROM SOME OF HIS ALSO PROVIDES A MEMBER AWARDS PLEASE. IT WILL CALL THE ROLL ON AB SIX SIXTEEN. OCEAN OF THE PAST TWO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA HI KALRA AYE FLORA FLORA NOW BEEN SALAS HI GONZALEZ I JONES SAWYER STONE HI STONE ICE ZERO NO BETTER KNOWN WARD. WARD I. WHAT THE BILL'S OUT THANK YOU. MR WITH WAREHOUSES THAT THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I HAVE SOMEBODY WAITING FOR THE- I THINK THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON IS THERE. GONZALEZ CALL RATIO. AND SO WE'LL START TO WITH THE CENTRE GONZALEZ I BELIEVE AB SEVEN OH ONE IS WHAT SHE IS GOING OFF TO START WITH IT WHICH IS FINE. THAT'S FILE ITEM THIRTEEN. THESE ROOMS ARE COLD. THAT HE COULD HAVE THINK IT THOUGH THE GENTLEMAN. ALL RIGHT WE'RE START WITH AB SEVEN A ONE- SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO MAKE NEXT DOOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY POSSIBLE CORPORATIONS LIKE AMAZON AND WALMART HAVE STRETCHED THEIR WAREHOUSE WORKERS THAN BY FORCING THEM TO WORK FASTER TO SERVICE MORE CUSTOMERS WITH MORE ORDERS IN RECORD AMOUNTS OF TIME. THE COMPANY'S OBSESSION WITH CONVENIENCE HAS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF WORKERS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IT'S TIME WE CAN FOR THE TRUTH THE WORKERS WHOSE LABOR MAKES THIS CONVENIENCE POSSIBLE. RECORDS HAVE SHOWN AMAZON WORKERS ARE INJURED AT THE JOB TWICE THE AVERAGE RATE OF OTHER WAREHOUSE IN INDUSTRY AND THREE TIMES THE AVERAGE RATE ACROSS ALL PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYERS. THESE COMPANIES HAVE CREATED ENVIRONMENT WHERE WORKERS ARE TREATED LIKE MACHINE SUBJECT TO CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE MANAGE THEIR ALGORITHMS EVERY DAY THEY FACE CRUSHING WORK SPEEDS TO MEET RELENTLESS PRODUCTIVITY QUOTAS THAT CAN CHANGE WITHOUT ANY NOTICE THEIR TIME MOVEMENTS AND HOW QUICKLY THEY CAN PACKAGE IT TIMES UP TO FOUR HUNDRED ITEMS IN AN HOUR IT'S STRICTLY TRACKED. MINUTES BETWEEN SCANNING PACKAGES WHERE THE SYSTEM DETECTS THE WORKERS OFF TASK CAN RESULT IN AUTOMATIC DISCIPLINE OR EVEN TERMINATION. NO WORKER SHOULD HAVE TO ACCEPT SUCH UNDIGNIFIED CONDITIONS FOR PAYCHECK WE SHOULD HAVE TO SPECIFY IN LAW THAT WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO USE BATHROOM INSTEAD OF URINATING A WATER BOTTLE OR THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO WASH THEIR HANDS AND SANITIZER CLEMENT DURING A PANDEMIC AND FORTUNATELY STORIES OF COUNTLESS WAREHOUSE WORKERS HAVE MADE IT CLEAR WE DO HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO THAT.% WORKERS HAVE REPEATEDLY GOTTEN INJURED ON THE JOB BECAUSE THEY WERE FORCED TO RUSH THROUGH SAFETY PROTOCOLS TO TRY TO. MEET RATE YET MOST CNNOT SPEAK OUT FOR FEAR OF LOSING THEIR JOB AB SEVEN A ONE WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR WORKERS COULD NOT BE DISCIPLINED FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA THAT DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS. THAT COMPLIANCE TIME COULD NOT BE COUNTED AGAINST THEM AS BEING OFF TASK IF A WORKER FACES DISCIPLINE WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THEY COMPLAINED ABOUT A HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN TO THEIR EMPLOYER OR STATE AGENCY THAT AB SEVEN OH ONE WOULD CREATE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION. THAT THE ADVERSE ACTION TAKEN BY THE COMPANY WITH RETALIATORY ONCE A COMPLAINT IS FILED THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE- CAL OSHA TO NOTIFY. WORKERS A GIVEN WORKSITE. OF THEIR RIGHTS TO REPORT UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS TO SEE IF THERE IS A PATTERN. FINALLY A. B. SEVEN OH ONE CREATES MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING THE BASIC EXPECTATION THAT AFRAID WAREHOUSE OPERATES WITH A PRIVATE. PRODUCTION QUOTA. THAT THEY NEED TO TELL THEIR WORKERS WITH THE QUOTA IS IN WHEN IT CHANGES. IN ADDITION TO ANY VERSE ACTIONS THAT COULD FACE FOR FAILING TO MEET THE QUOTA I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE WE ARE NOT SAYING THAT THERE CANNOT BE A PRODUCTION QUOTA. WE'RE SAYING THE WORKER HAS TO UNDERSTAND THE COURT THE PRODUCTION QUOTA TRANSPARENCY IF IT SHOULD CHANGE. AND UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TO NOT MEET IT. UNDER THE BILL EMPLOYERS CANNOT FIRE RETALIATES AGAINST EMPLOYEES FOR FAILING TO MEET A QUOTA THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT. IF THEY KNEW ABOUT THE QUOTA. AND KNEW ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES HOWEVER THEY COULD STILL BE FIRED. ULTIMATELY AB SEVEN NO ONE WOULD ALSO ALLOW STATE AGENCIES TO ACCESS THESE WAREHOUSE QUOTA RECORDS AND DIRECT CAL OSHA TO THEN CREATE A WAREHOUSE SAFETY STANDARD. THAT MINIMIZES WORKER INJURIES AND WAREHOUSES THAT USE PRODUCTION QUOTAS. THIS IS NEW IT'S SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT IT IS TIME AND NECESSARY THAT WE ACT ON THIS I HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE FOR BRIEF TESTIMONY STARTING WITH RICK ROSE MARIE MOLINA WITH LA COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR. THANK YOU SO THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL ASK THE WITNESSES NOW ROSE MARIE MOLINA FOLLOWED BY THE SENATE BHARARA UP TO TWO MINUTES A ROSARY IF YOU'RE READY YOU MAY BEGIN. YOU SO MUCH CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS ROSE MARIE MOLINA AND I'M WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY FEDERATION OF LABOR WE REPRESENT OVER THREE HUNDRED UNION FOR THE LA AREA AND WE'RE SPONSORING AB SEVEN ALONG AT SEVEN OH ONE ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS PUBLIC AFFAIRS COUNCIL AND WAREHOUSE WORKER RESTRICTIONISTS ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS NUMBER IS INCREASING BECAUSE OF ON DEMAND DELIVERY. AMAZON IN THE WAREHOUSING GIANT AND MORE COMPANIES ARE COMPETING WITH AMAZON TO PROMISED ONE DAY DELIVERY IN OUR EGION AND SOMETIMES EVEN TWO HOURS WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE COST OF THE CONVENIENCE ACROSS INDUSTRY. WAREHOUSE WORKERS FACE WIDESPREAD INJURED INJURIES CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE AND PACE OF WORK STANDARDS THAT ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS EIGHTY SEVEN OH ONE PROVIDES MORE TRANSPARENCY AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS FOR WORKERS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE REQUIRING WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS I'M VERY EMPLOYERS TO THE CONCORD. ADVOCATE THE WORK STANDARDS. WE SPOKEN TO NUMEROUS. WHO HAVE BEEN IN TRYING TO UP WITH PACE OF. ONE YOUNG FROM PAIRS OF I THOUGHT TO WAS NOT FOR HOW PACKAGE PER HOUR. THAT SEVEN TAX PER MINUTE A PACKAGE AND ELEVEN. AND PEOPLE KEEP UP WITH THIS THAT TEN OUR AT A TIME. AND THE WOMAN I SPOKE TO TORN LIGAMENT IN HER KNEE TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE PACE. AND BEFORE SHE WAS INJURED SHOULD BE HARASSED BY THE MANAGERS TO WORK FASTER. WHEN SHE ASKED HIM IF SHE SHOULD WORK FASTER. SAFER HE TOLD HER TO FIGURE IT OUT. MONDAY MY OR- BROUGHT. WORKS BY. TO THE- OF THE CAPITOL. HE SAID OF THE WHITE. DEMONSTRATION AFTER DECIDED TO WORK IN ASSEMBLY LINE AT THE PACE OF WORK THAT THE WORKERS. FOUR HUNDRED PACKAGE PACKAGES IN OUR- I COULD GO TO JUSTIFY EVEN LIKE THE FACT THAT ON THE BOND ON RECORDS SHOW THAT ITS WORKERS ARE INJURED ON THE JOB.

THIRTY TO SIXTY CALLING HOURS. WALK FIFTEEN TO THIRTY MILES A DAY WITH NO PROPER REST TIME IN BETWEEN- I WAS A SEASONAL EMPLOYEE I WORK HARD TO BE ABLE TO.

CORRECTLY THAT THERE'S A LOT HERE COMPLICATED- OUR STUDY CONCERT INCLUDE A NEW PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION NEW PARKING ENFORCEMENT NEW NOTICE REQUIREMENTS THE DISCIPLINARY REQUIREMENTS. AND TO NEW REGULATIONS RELATED TO WORK'S BEEN WAREHOUSE THAT ONCE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND ANOTHER ONE HELLO SURE. AND IN ADDITION WE HAVE A PRESUMPTION THE RETALIATION OR WE COULD DO IT DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD RESULT IN A- CAN CONSTANT- PROVOKE THAT HAVE DELEGATION. I'LL GET THE THOUGHT THAT BEFORE I TURNED IT UP WE THOUGHT WOULD BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO ANY ONE EMPLOYER ONE SITUATION THAT COVERS ALL WAREHOUSE ACROSS CALIFORNIA YOU CAN LOOK AT THE ENACT YET THE BILL FOR THAT. AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A KIND OF BROAD COALITION OF CONCERN ON.OUR SITE- I TO BRIEFLY TOUCH THE- THAT SOME SHOULD THE BILL WHICH IS THE USE OF METRIC FOR PRODUCT. WOULD YOUR PREFERRED QUOTA ARE IN. AND ALSO TO MOST WAREHOUSES. ON THAT. EVER TO THE CONCLUSION. BECAUSE PRO. HOW BEEN. THAT WHAT IS THAT EIGHT. HOW PERFORMANCE OF AN AVERAGE EMPLOYEE IT'S NOT AN ARBITRARY NUMBER THAT. FITS WHAT IS ACHIEVABLE WHAT BEEN DONE IN THE PAST THAT'S WHAT WE USE- TURNING TO THOSE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS- SO THE FIRST THE PART RIGHT ACTION PAGO WE HAVE CONCERNS WILL CERTAINLY LEAD TO LITIGATION BECAUSE- EIGHTY SEVEN OF ONE INCLUDES A RATHER BIG STANDARD. THAT ALL. WORKPLACE METRICS MUCH QUOTE LEAVE TIME FOR EMPLOYEES TO COMPLY WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS. AND THAT BIG REQUIREMENTS LEAVE TIME FOR EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HEALTH AND SAFETY WE THINK. IT'S HAVING A BIG ENOUGH IT'LL BE HARD TO FIGHT ABOUT IT WILL BE TO THE GAUGE OF CURRENT PLAYERS EVEN WHEN THEY PROPERLY DID THE PLAN INTO PLACE- TURNING WE ALSO HAVE A- THE ISSUE OF A NEVER ENDING PERCENT RETALIATION. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PROVIDE THEIR PRODUCTION RETALIATES I COULD BE A PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION. AFTER NINETY DAYS WHATEVER EMPLOYEE REQUEST DATA ON THEIR PATCHWORK SPEAK. SO ALL YOU DO IS EVERY THREE MONTHS. HEY CAN YOU GIVE ME AN UPDATE ON OUR PROGRESS IT. AND I WILL HAVE A PERENNIAL- A PRESUMPTION OF RETALIATION. FOR ANY DISCIPLINE GET. I OTHER NOW I BELIEVE THE OPERATE TEN THE FACT THAT BUT- ANOTHER NO ABOUT THE RUNNING BACK. WHICH I WANT TO. HERE IS THAT PRESENTLY THE RIGHT ABOUT PROVIDE FOR. FEES TO BE RECOVERED. REGARD OF WHETHER THE ACT IS MERIT. EVEN IF YOU BRING THEM PRINT TO. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER ITS FEES WHICH- IS UNPRECEDENTED FAR AS WE KNOW IN. PROVISIONS IN LAW- AT THE TO REGULATION SHOWING THE FLAG. THIS BILL CALLS FOR REGULATION OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND ALSO FROM CAL OSHA BOTH FOCUSED ON WAREHOUSES- AND PATHETICALLY BE CALIFORNIA'S RECALL THAT MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES- I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT. HELLO. CHAU ALREADY HOW THE REGULATION. THE MOTION INJURY STANDARD SECTION FIFTY ONE TEN. THAT CALL THAT MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES AND TOUCHES THAT SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE CREATING DUPLICATIVE AND POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING REGULATIONS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ONE ON THAT- IN TERMS OF. HOW TO CHECK THIS ISSUE AT THAT THE CONCERN. BOB THERE'S ALSO A HOST OF NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR PURPOSE THE TIME IN LIGHT OF THE LINK THAT THE HEARING THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD IN FRONT OF IT. I WILL NOT GO THROUGH THE- BUT THEY THEY OFF THAT LOGISTICAL CONCERNS SUPPORT IN TERMS THAT THE VILLAGE DO.

I THINK I WAS CALLED FOR LAST YEAR'S VERSION BUT- ANY CASE APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FOURTH AND- WOULD BE INCLINED ALSO- JOINT AGAIN AS A CO AUTHOR AND I THINK THAT- LEAVE ME SEE WHAT THE I GUESS IS AS- BUT THE HOT WEATHER THERE'S A HIGH COST LOW PRICES SOMETIMES. ESPECIALLY AS IT APPLIES TO THEM THE RAPIDLY INCREASING USE OF WAREHOUSES WAREHOUSE WORKERS IN THIS NEW ECONOMY- AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME LIMITATION TO THAT THEM AND THEN THESE ARE HUMAN BEINGS YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE WORKING AND- THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME STANDARDS IN PLACE. AS A HOW MUCH YOU CAN PUT AN INDIVIDUAL PUT THE BODY THROUGH WE'VE GONE THROUGH. THE GOVERNOR AND US REVOLUTION WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL THESE DIFFERENT. MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY. YOU KNOW TO TRY TO PROTECT WORKERS TO HAVE TO GO BACK UP AGAIN- AND CREATE THE SELLERS CONDITIONS AND SITUATIONS WHERE- WERE TREATING INDIVIDUALS LIKE ROBOTS. AND THIS KIND OF DYSTOPIAN. IN OF BEING TRACE AND FOLLOW IN BEING FIRED BY AN ALGORITHM I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME SENSE OF WHAT KIND OF- AS AS THESE JOBS ARE INCREASING AND THE PROFIT. BEING MADE IS INCREDIBLE- THROUGH THE THROUGH THE ONLINE MARKETING ONLINE. ACADEMY SO WITH THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I DO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE THINGS THAT WERE- I WOULD SUGGEST MISREPRESENTED BY THE OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR- FIRST AND FOREMOST IT DOES NOT AFFECT ALL WAREHOUSES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AT A SITE OR THOUSAND STATE WIDE PORT TO BE TRIGGERED SELF. SMALLER WAREHOUSES- ARE NOT AFFECTED BY THIS IT ALSO DOESN'T AFFECT WAREHOUSES THEY DON'T HAVE WORK QUOTAS WE HEARD FROM SOME INDIVIDUALS WHO SAID. WE DON'T USE A COMPUTER SYSTEM AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE WORK QUOTA YOU HAVE NOTHING TO- TO DISCLOSE TO YOUR WORKERS SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. HELLO SHOULD DOES HAVE WORKPLACE STANDARDS FOR REPETITIVE MOTIONS HOWEVER THESE AREN'T SUBJECT TO THE PRODUCTIVITY QUOTAS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS BILL SO IT WOULDN'T IT WOULDN'T. MATCH UP TO WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AND WE KNOW S WORK CHANGES AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF A. I. AND ALGORITHMS TO WORK. BUT THIS TYPE OF REGULATION IS GOING TO BE NECESSARY UNFORTUNATELY WHEN YOU TAKE THE HUMAN COMPONENT OUT OF EVALUATING WORKPLACE SPEED AND- PRODUCTIVITY. YOU'RE YOU'RE MISSING- THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND IF SOMEBODY. HAD TO USE THE RESTROOM ONE DAYER ARE HOW TO WASH THEIR HANDS YOU'RE YOU'RE LOSING OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE. FIRSTHAND BY HUMAN BEING IF THINGS ARE JUST GOING TO FAST IN OUR DANGER SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT. SO WE NEED TO MAKE- OUR OUR RULES AND REGULATIONS ESPECIALLY OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY REGULATIONS MATCH UP TO THE REAL WORLD WORLD WORK PLACE THAT WE'RE IN TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- OBVIOUSLY AS- YOU KNOW THE- THESE COMPANIES. CAN AFFORD- TO DO THIS- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE PAGA- IMPLICATIONS IN THIS BILL. OUR REBUTTAL ARE NOT REBUTTABLE THEY'VE RIGHT HERE THERE IN THAT PORTION OF THE LABOR CODE SO THAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW AS WELL- AND DOES. THE SUGGESTION THAT THE LABOR COMMISSIONER AND OSHA HAVE DIFFERENT STANDARDS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER ONLY HAS- THE RETALIATION PORTION OF THIS BILL IT OSHA HAS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY SO THAT THEY CAN'T THEY'RE NOT GOING TO END UP WITH. WITH DUPLICATIVE ARE ARE ARE CONTRADICTORY ADVICE THERE SO- THE EXAMPLE USED ON RETALIATION IT. OF I'M ASKING FOR YOUR DATA EVERY THREE MONTHS I UNDERSTAND FIRST OF ALL. I COULD ARGUE THAT REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR RETALIATION IS ALWAYS EASY FOR AND THE POWER OF THE EMPLOYER TO BE ABLE TO- TO PUSH BACK ON BUT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE DATA PIECE. OF IT AS BEING THE ONLY. AS FIGURING OUT HOW HOW TO WORK THROUGH- A CRAFTY EMPLOYEE WHO WHO WANTS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES BY ASKING FOR DATA WHICH I THINK IS A REASONABLE THING TO DO- GIVEN THAT YOU WOULD JUST STILL HAVE TO READ BUT- ANY. ANY QUESTIONS OF RETALIATION BASED ON WORK PERFORMANCE WHICH BY THE WAY. YOU'LL HAVE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR HERE. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I ABOUT. THANK YOU. SOME AND SOME MEMBERS ACTUALLY HAVE A MOTION FROM MADE BY SUMMER STYLE SECOND BY KALRA. PLEASE TAKE A ROLE IN AB SEVEN OH ONE. MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA THANK KALRA HI FLORA.

THE BILL ALSO CREATES A FAST FOOD SECTOR COUNCIL WHICH WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE ENTIRELY NEW AND DIFFERENT LABOR EMPLOYMENT WAIT AN HOUR AND HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. BUT A. FIVE WEEK THE FAST FOOD CHAIN. THOSE ARE ALL SUBJECT THAT BY STATE AND COUNTY LAWS RUNNING THERE BUT- WHY WOULD THE LEGISLATURE UP IN THE STORE ONE I KNOW WHAT THE BOARD TO MAKE THE THINGS. THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT COMMITTEE SHOULD CONSIDER WHY IS THE FAST FOOD FRANCHISE INDUSTRY BEING SINGLED OUT WHEN THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. I WANT TO DECIDED THAT THE BILL ONLY APPLIES TO FAST FOOD FRANCHISES WITH THIRTY OR MORE LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT FRANCHISEES ARE NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THERE THE WORKPLACE VIOLATION.

EMPLOYEE AND THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY- AN OWNER OF A RESTAURANT THAT WAS NOT HANDLING THINGS PROPERLY. BUT IN IN MY RESTAURANTS AND RESTAURANTS. OWNED BY FRANCHISEE THAT I KNOW- THINGS WERE QUITE DIFFERENT DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN IT HIT WE SET OUR MINDS THAT THE SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES. AND OUR CUSTOMERS WERE SEPTEMBER SPOTS ABILITY. AND AGREED THOUGHT PLEXI SHIELDS MASTER ONE BY ALL EMPLOYEES FACE CARD BY THOSE HAVING CONTACT WITH CUSTOMERS IN WASHINGTON SANITIZING STRICTLY ENFORCED AND ALL OF THEM THIS WASN'T EASY BUT WE'RE USED TO IN THE RESTAURANTS WE KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE IN SPAIN COUNTY GUIDANCE THAT WAS CONSTANTLY COMING DOWN AND CHANGING WE CLOSELY FOLLOWED ALL THE FIFTY ONE IS AN IMPLEMENTED BY THE NEXT BUSINESS DAY. AND I'M NOT HAPPY THAT WE DID SCREENING OF EMPLOYEES BEFORE EVERY SHIFT INCLUDING ASKING QUESTIONS OF THE CONTACT BEHAVIORS OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE AND THOSE ATTENDING LARGE GATHERINGS ARE ASKED TO GO BACK TO QUARANTINE AND COME BACK TO WORK FIVE DAYS LATER THEY HAVE NO SYMPTOMS EACH EMPLOYEE WE DID HAVE SOME CASES EACH PERSON REPORTING A POSITIVE CASE PUT THE QUARANTINE WELL AS OTHER EMPLOYEES WERE CLOSE CONTACT WITH THEM FOR OVER TEN MINUTES BY DOING THIS. WE WERE ABLE TO TRACE IT BACK TO ITS ORIGIN AND THAT ONE CASE DURING THE WHOLE PROGRAM WE FOUND WAS TRACED BACK TO OUR WORKPLACE COMMON SOURCES WERE. A LARGE FAMILY AND SOCIAL GATHERINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT. BEEN GIVEN I MEAN THIS OF CALIFORNIA HAS IN. HAS A NOW LIKE FIFTEEN PAID. OF RESTAURANT. FOR KOBE NINETEEN PROTOCOLS TO FOLLOW AND THEN EACH COUNTY HAS THEIR OWN. ADDITIONAL SECTOR REQUIREMENTS. IN ORDER TO FILL IN THE ORDER OF ALL THESE BEING ISSUED WITHOUT NOTICE AND I LITERALLY CHANGING DAY BY DAY HOW DID YOU RESPOND IN YOUR WORKPLACE THESE KINDS THAT SUDDEN SHIFTS. I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS WHO WERE IN IN DOING THE BEST JOB THEY COULD. BUT SOME OF THE MEASURES WERE CONSTANTLY CHANGING AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE HOW DID YOU ADJUST ALL THE ON THE FLY. LIKE I SAID WE- WILL USE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF KEEPING THE PUBLIC SAFE. KEEP EMPLOYED SIX SO. IN RESTAURANT BUSINESS THAT'S- ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE DO. HAVE SO PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ANYWAY SO EVERY DAY THAT WOULD COME DOWN THAT NIGHT I'D BE UP TILL WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING WITH MY OPERATING PARTNER AND WE CAN MAKE SURE WE PUT OUT. MEMOS THAT SET UP EACH OF OUR MANAGERS THAT MEETINGS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES TO MAKE SURE ALL THOSE GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED VERY CLOSELY. AND OTHER FRANCHISEES I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO SAY. AWESOME SO BASICALLY TOOK THEIR GUIDELINES AND APPLIED A LITTLE BIT OF COMMON SENSE TO IT AND YOU WERE ABLE TO KEEP- YOUR PATRONS AND YOUR EMPLOYEES SAFE- IS AT THE GENERAL GIST OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I WOULD SAY THAT- IN IN WERE AREADY EXCEEDING. THE GUIDELINES THAT THAT CAME DOWN SO IT WASN'T THAT HARD FOR US. TO MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT. I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME IN YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WHEN THE LAWSUIT WAS- YES. SEATTLE WHO WORKED IN A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT. I HAVE. I THINK EVERYBODY GETS THEIR START IN ONE OF- YOU KNOW MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS AND MANY OTHER BILLS YOU KNOW IT'S NOT JUST THIS THIS PARTICULAR BILL IS I REMEMBER GOING TO A- A SEMINAR OR- CONFERENCE OR WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT. ON THE FUTURE OF THE WORK FORCE AND IT REALLY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE ROBOTICS INDUSTRY. AND HOW WE ARE KIND OF MARCHING TOWARDS THIS PATH WHERE ROBOTICS ARE EXPENSIVE. BUT AS WE MARCH FURTHER AND FURTHER TOWARDS THE MIDDLE WHERE ROBOTICS WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME MORE ECONOMICAL THAN HAVING PEOPLE WORK. AND I AM AFRAID OF THAT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT PEOPLE NOT WORKING. ONCE ROBOTS ROBOTS REPLACE WORKERS- GENERAL THEN I THINK WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE. AND AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF MY FEARS WITH A LOT OF THESE- THIS INTRUSION INTO HOW PEOPLE RUN THEIR BUSINESSES- AND IT IS EVENTUALLY THEY WILL MAKE IT TOO EXPENSIVE TO HAVE EMPLOYEES THEY WON'T HAVE FIFTEEN OR TWENTY THEY'LL HAVE TWO OR THREE THAT ARE EXPERTS IN ROBOTICS AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU GO TO HIGH SCHOOL LOOK AT THE ROBOTICS TEAMS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THEY'RE DOING. YOU WILL KNOW WHERE THAT FUTURE WORK FORCE IS GOING TO COME FROM BUT IT WILL ONLY BE TWO OR THREE OF THEM. SO YOU KNOW THOSE AT YOU THAT'S KIND OF MY CONCERN. IS I THINK THAT WE ARE INTRUDING WAY TOO MUCH. INTO PRIVATE INDUSTRY. AND THE MORE WE DO THAT THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT GETS. AND THE MORE WE PUSH THEM INTO ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF RUNNING THEIR BUSINESSES AND PROVIDING YOUR SERVICES. AND YOU SEE THAT WITH THE AMAZON AND THEIR- THEIR DRONES THAT ARE DELIVERING INSTEAD OF THOSE FOLKS. AND YEAH YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT I REALLY DON'T. SO ANYWAY. I HAVE A LOT OF OBJECTIONS TO WHERE WE'RE HEADED- I YOU KNOW I WANT PEOPLE TO BE SAFE AND I WANT THEM TO HAVE A GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT- BUT I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE PATH IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THAT IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. APPREHENDED EMOTION. THE MOTION SIR SECOND AND THE SECOND TO THE MOTION FROM SUMMER STONE SECONDED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARD- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST I. YOU KNOW. I DON'T WANT TO HARP ON IT BUT- BEFORE I CAME TO THIS GREAT INSTITUTION EIGHT YEARS AGO I WORKED FOR THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND EVERY SINGLE TIME WE TRY TO ESPECIALLY FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS TO IMPROVE THE CONDITIONS EITHER THROUGH PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS OR PUBLIC ACTION- THE ILLUSTRIOUS ROBOT HAS ALWAYS BEEN USED AS THE REASON TO NOT DO IT AND I THINK BACK TO THE WORKERS WHO. I'VE FOUGHT TO PROTECT. TWENTY YEARS AGO. WHO SPENT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN CONDITIONS BECAUSE ROBOTS DIDN'T REPLACE THEM. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REALIZE YES TECHNOLOGY WILL HAPPEN THERE WILL BE ADVANCEMENT IN THE WORKPLACE BUT THE MEANTIME WE DON'T THROW AWAY WORKERS WE DON'T SAY. IT'S OKAY THAT THEY'RE AN UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE IT'S OKAY THEY DON'T HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB WE CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO IT AND DIRECTION THAT IS GOING TO BE BETTER FOR ALL WORKERS. I'M WITH YOU I WANT PEOPLE TO WORK I VALUE WORK AND I THINK THE WORK WILL CHANGE IT'LL CONTINUE TO CHANGE. BUT ONE THING HASN'T CHANGED- LOW WAGE SERVICE WORK IS STILL DANGEROUS IT IT'S STILL HARMFUL TO WORKERS. I YES ABSOLUTELY- THE GENTLEMAN WHO SPOKE WAS PROBABLY A GOOD EXAMPLE BUT IN REALITY WE HAVE SO MANY COMPLAINTS FROM WORKERS THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE NORM. AND SO WE JUST WANT TO WITH THIS BILL TO LOOK AT AN INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY LOW WAGES- BYE BYE LACK OF HEALTH CARE BY. AS SCHEDULING MISHAPS THAT DON'T ALLOW THEM TO EVEN HOLD A FULL TIME JOB THEY'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY A SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND THEY'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY- HEALTH AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC AND BEFORE. WE WANT THEM TO HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB AND BECAUSE THE FRANCHISE OR FRANCHISEE MODEL. THAT HASN'T BEEN POSSIBLE AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR OTHER WAYS TO GIVE THEM A VOICE ON THE JOB IN AS FAR AS A THIRD PARTY- COMMISSION HAVING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY IN FACT THE IWC. THE INDUSTRIAL WELFARE COMMISSION STARTING CALIFORNIA NINETEEN TIRTEEN AND RAN UNTIL TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHEN IT WAS DEFENDED BECAUSE- IT BECAME AN EFFORT TO UNDER CUTS. LABOR STANDARDS BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD ANOPPORTUNITY ARE WE DID HISTORICALLY IN CALIFORNIA FOR A COMMISSION TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE. WE'RE GOING TO GIVE WORKERS A VOICE IN THE WORKPLACE A GROUP OF WORKERS WHO DESPITE NOT HAVING POWER OR LEVERAGE HAS LED THIS NATION INTO A FIGHT FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR HAS WON IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS LEADING THE FIGHT NATIONALLY AND THEY DESERVE AND THEY HAVE CHAU OWN US THEY HAVE GOOD IDEAS AND NECESSITIES IN THE WORKPLACE AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE AT THE TABLE TO THE TO THAT.

THANK YOU I'M AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR STARTED OUT AS A MUCH BROADER BILL WE HANDLED A LOT OF THE ISSUES THANKS TO BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND THANKS TO OUR GOVERNOR AND THE LEADERSHIP OF BOTH HOUSES- WHO ENSURED THAT WE GOT A REHIRE RIGHTS FOR OUR- HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY WORKERS IN AND LARGE VENUES. ALL THIS BILL DOES NOW IS LINE UP- HOTEL WORKERS WITH A EXISTING ORDINANCE- THAT COVERS JANITORIAL WORKERS UNDER EXISTING LAW AFTER SERVICE CONTRACT HAS BEEN TERMINATED A SUCCESSOR JANITORIAL BUILDING MAINTENANCE CONTRACTORS REQUIRED. TO MAKE EMPLOYMENT OFFERS TO RETAIN EXISTING WORKERS BASED ON SENIORITY FOR AT LEAST SIXTY DAYS. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR WOULD ADD SIMILARLY SITUATED HOTEL SERVICE WORKERS TO ITS LONGSTANDING LAW. PATEL SERVICE JOBS INCLUDING FOOD AND BEVERAGE CLEANING GUEST SERVICES ARE SIMILAR SIMILARLY OUTSOURCED AND PERFORMED BY CONTRACTED OR SUBCONTRACTED EMPLOYEES THESE WORKERS GENERALLY REPORT TO THE SAME WORK SITE EACH DAY WEAR THE UNIFORMS THE HOTEL THEY ARE CLEANING. REPORT TO MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ON SITE REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC CONTRACTOR THAT THEY HAPPEN TO BE WORKING FOR. THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED SIMILAR LAWS IN OTHER INDESTRUCTIBLE STREETS PROVIDING RETENTION RIGHTS FOR MINIMUM OF NINETY DAYS INCLUDING FOR GROCERY WORKERS- WHEN THE BUSINESSES THEY WORK FOR GOES UNDER THAT GOES OUR UNDERGOES A CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP. AS WELL AS FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT AND WASTE COLLECTION CONTRACTORS THIS IS COMMONSENSE POLICY THAT WILL ENSURE JOB SECURITY FOR THOUSANDS OF OUR HARDEST HIT WORKERS ARE MONEY PROBLEMS.

WHEN A BORROWER WITH SEIU CALIFORNIA ALSO SUPPORT THANK YOU. NO FURTHER COMMENTS IN Q. THANK YOU WE WILL MOVE ON TO A POSITION OF TRUST FINAL DECISION ON THE PHONE IS JOHN PAUL WELL FOR THEIR JOURNEY MAY BEGIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN CALDWELL ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOTEL AND LODGING ASSOCIATION- AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF BOUTIQUE AND BREAKFAST INNS- JUST LAST WEEK THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB NINETY THREE A BUDGET BILL THAT IS NEARLY IDENTICAL TO THE DELETED PORTIONS OF AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR. SB NINETY THREE WHICH IS ALREADY THE LAW. CREATES A BURDENSOME AND PAINFULLY SLOW PROCESS TO BRING BACK LAID OFF HOTEL EMPLOYEES. AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED DOWN TO THE ONE PROVISION THAT DID NOT MAKE IT INTO. A SB NINETY THREE ONLY ADDS TO THE BURDENS TO AN INDUSTRY ALREADY IN SERIOUS TROUBLE. UNDER THIS BILL A HOTEL WILL FOREVER HAVE TO KEEP THEIR EXISTING SERVICE CONTRACTORS AND WOULD HAVE NO DEFENSE AGAINST PRICE INCREASES BY CONTRACTORS. IF THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT MEETING THE HOTEL STANDARDS A NEW CONTRACTOR IS SIMPLY NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE UNDERPERFORMING CONTRACTOR HAVING NO INSIGHT TO THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES AND THEIR COMPENSATION. AS A RESULT FINDING A REPLACEMENT. SIGN REPLACEMENT FOR A BAD OR SUBSTANDARD CONTRACTOR IS UNATTAINABLE. EVEN ACQUIRING COMPETITIVE BIDS AS A REGULAR BUSINESS PRACTICE IS SEVERELY THREATENED KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT THE AVERAGE HOTEL YOU HAS HUNDREDS OF CONTRACTED PROVIDERS EVERYTHING FROM FLORISTS TO PARKING TO PAYROLL SERVICES. NOW IT'S PROBLEMATIC AT S. B. NINETY THREE IS IT IS LIMITED TO LAY OFF TO DO THE CALL THE NINETEEN. THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO COPE WITH SB NINETY THREE AT THE SUNSET THIS DOES NOT HAVE A SUNSET. M. S. B. NINETY THREE WAS LIMITED TO HOTELS WITH ROOMS WITH WITH FIFTY RUNS OR MORE THIS BILL APPLIES ALL HOTELS THIS. SMALL BED AND BREAKFASTS THAT TYPICALLY CONTRACT FOR MANY SERVICES WILL BE COVERED BY THIS BILL. OVER 20% OF ALL HOTELS WERE CLOSED FOR AT LEAST PART OF THE PANDEMIC AND THOSE THAT REMAINED OPEN SAW PRECIPITOUS DROP IN OCCUPANCY. I HAD TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES ADDING TO THE BURDENS OF RUNNING A HOTEL AS THIS BILL DOES WILL MAKE IT THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT FOR THIS INDUSTRY. TO BRING BACK THOSE LAID OFF WORKERS. THANK YOU I'M IT THERE'S NO ONE IN IN THE ROOMS OF ALL GO TO THE PHONES OF FOR THOSE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN SEVENTY FOUR YOU MAY. PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONE MOMENT PLEASE. NINE THREE SEVENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. PLEASE GO AHEAD AND YOU'LL GET THE MONEY CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THERE ARE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU- WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS OR MOTIONS ON- A. B. TEN SEVENTY FOUR. OKAY THE MOTION AND A SECOND- BY SURE. YES- THE OPPOSITION CAN ACTUALLY COVERED A LOT OF WHAT I WAS GONNA ASK BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS VERY VERY SIMILAR TO SB NINETY THREE THAT WE JUST. WHETHER THE BUDGET. SO I AM CURIOUS LIKE WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE. M. AND THEN QUITE FRANKLY I KNOW THAT THE BILL'S GONE AND IT'S MOVED ON. BUT- WHY THAT BILL WAS IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND IT WASN'T POLICY BILL AND THIS ONE IS A WE'RE DEBATING IT NOW TODAY BECAUSE- IT ESSENTIALLY IS DOING AFFECT SAME THING. BUT EXPANDING IT- TO SMALLER AND TAKE OUT THE COVERT NINETEEN PROVISIONS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE AND I UNDERSTAND IT TO BE HONEST IT DOES GET CONFUSING. IF IT WERE- LIKE THE ORDINANCE WE PASS FOR EXAMPLE FOR GROCERY WORKERS NOT LONG AGO THAT THAT. IS MORE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE PASSED IN NINETY THREE- THAT HAS THE PROTECTION UPON SALE THAT THOSE WORKERS REMAIN PART OF- GET THEY THEY GO WITH THE SALE FOR NINETY DAYS THAT'S- THAT'S WHAT WE HAD DO TO COPE ED. IT IN NINETY THREE DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. THIS HAS TO DO WITH THE CONTRACTORS INSIDE THE HOTEL SO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AND WORK SPACES MORE AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN HOTELS IS. THEIR HOUSEKEEPERS ARE DIRECT EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYEES OF A CONTRACTOR. AND OFF AND WE HAVE THIS IN JANITORIAL WE'VE HAD THIS PROTECTION FOR JANITORIAL WORKERS FOR A LONG TIME OFTEN. A NEW CONTRACTOR COME IN- AND THEY SOMETIMES WILL JUST REQUIRE THE SAME EMPLOYEES IT'S A CHANGE OF CONTRACTOR THESE THESE EMPLOYEES- THEY THEY DON'T SIT THERE THERE LIKE EMPLOYEES BUT THEY'RE OF THE CONTRACTOR BUT THE WORKING STRAIGHT THERE AT THE HOTEL SO THIS WOULD JUST SAY WHEN YOU CHANGE. A CONTRACTOR- YOU HAVE TO GIVE THESE EMPLOYEES AN OPPORTUNITY SHOW THIS NEW CONTRACTOR THAT THEY'RE GOOD. THEY ONLY GET SIXTY DAYS TO DO THAT AND THEN AT THAT TIME THEY CAN IN FACT- REPLACE BAD EMPLOYEES IF YOU'RE WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT PRODUCTIVE. BUT THIS GIVES THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY RATHER THAN HOST WHOLESALE BUYERS- JUST BECAUSE THE CONTRACTORS REMOTE. DURING KOBE AT POST COVER THIS MAY BE IMPORTANT ARE SOME CONTRACTORS THAT MIGHT HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS YOU KNOW AND YET YOU STILL HAVE THESE EMPLOYEES. WHO ONCE WORKED AT THIS HOTEL- WHO AREN'T COVERED BY BY A NINETY THREE WHICH WAS IF THEIR DIRECT EMPLOYEES OF THE HOTEL THIS IS THAT THE CONTRACTORS. THAT MAKE SENSE. IT DOES OKAY BUT IF WE HAVE LIKE ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND OF THESE HOTEL EMPLOYEES. HAVE BEEN LAID OFF BECAUSE OF COVERED RIGHT. I THINK THAT'S THE NUMBER THAT'S BEEN THROWN AROUND. SOMEWHERE IN THAT BALLPARK SB NINETY THREE AFFECTED SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS SO I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S BUT THAT. WAS LARGE VENUES AND AIRPORTS CHAU SO YEAH BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR SECTOR OR DELIVER ON THIS BILL IT'S I THINK IN THAT NUMBERS DOESN'T THAT. WE DON'T GET A LOT A LOT DON'T GET HUNG UP ON THAT. BUT IF YOU. ARE A NEW CONTRACTOR COMING IN. AND YOU. TO BASICALLY GIVE THOSE EMPLOYEES WITH EXISTING EMPLOYEES SIXTY DAYS AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE FIGHTING. DESPERATELY THREE OPEN OUR ECONOMY. AND WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO COME TO WORK. BUT WE HAVE SIXTY DAYS THAT WE HAVE TO HOLD ONTO A POSITION. FOR THIS OTHER EMPLOYED AMERICANS WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK OH NO NO NO NO NO THAT'S NOT HOW THIS WORKS I'M SORRY IT'S NOT NOW IN IN YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T THINK OF THIS IN A CO BID LET LET'S. IT IT MAY BE EASIER TO THINK OF A WAY AND WERE NOT IN COBIT RIGHT SO IT WOULDN'T APPLY IN FACT UNTIL IN JANUARY WHEN HOPEFULLY IF. YOU'RE FOR LONG OUT A CODE RED AND- BE HAPPY TO WORK ON SOME LANGUAGE TO SUGGEST THAT IN HERE AS WELL. SO NO IT IS A SITUATION WHERE THE CONTRACT IS AN ON GOING THE WORKERS HAVE BEEN THERE ALREADY THEY WERE ALREADY CAME BACK THERE WORKING FOR A CONTRACTOR THERE'S A NEW CONTRACTOR THAT COMES IN- THE NEXT DAY THEY'RE NOT FIRED YOU KNOW UNDER THE LAW RIGHT NOW THEY COULD BE REPLACED. IT'S OFTEN USED TO BE REALLY HONEST IT AT CHANGE OF CONTRACT. TOWARD IS OFTEN USED TO BUST AN ORGANIZING DRIVE- QUITE HONESTLY YOU KNOW IT IF THE HOTELS LIKE WELL WE DON'T REALLY WANT THOSE WORKERS TO BE UNIONIZED EVEN THOUGH THEY'D BE WORKING FOR THE SUB CONTRACTOR. CONTRACTOR SAYS OH MY BROTHER HAS A SIMILAR- CONTRACTOR. FIRM YOU YOU WAIT WE CAN GET HOTEL WORKERS AT. HOPE TELL HOUSEKEEPERS FROM HIM. YEAH WE'LL JUST END UP THE WAY TO REPLACE WORKERS WHO ARE ORGANIZING SO THIS JUST SAYS. WELL YOU CAN REPLACE THE CONTRACT. AND I KNOW FOR FOLKS WHO AREN'T IN THE INDUSTRY- AND WHEN WE DID JANITORIAL I THINK IT FELT THE SAME WAY YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT THESE CONTRACTORS. ARE IN FACT USING THE SAME LABOR PULL OVER AND OVER AND IN DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT IT'S NOT. AS IF THEY THEY'RE COMING IN ITH THEIR OWN LABOR- PULL BECAUSE THEY'RE COMING INTO A SITUATION WHERE THESE WORKERS ARE WORKING FULL TIME AT THE HOTEL. SO IT'S JUST. SAYING YOU GOT TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM SIX DAYS. C. YOU KNOW BY SENIORITY IF YOU NEED FEWER PEOPLE THAT MEANS A- SENIOR. GET THE ARE. FIRST AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WITH A FOR AT CLASS. AT OF WORK WHO ARE- WOMEN OF. WOMEN WHO ARE AGING AND WHO. SOMETIMES REPLACED YOUNG CHEAPER. JUST BECAUSE THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY THAT EXISTS IN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY NOT L. FINALISTS AND WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR AWHILE- DO YOU THINK. COMPETITION BETWEEN CONTRACTORS LIKE POACHING OTHER EMPLOYEES. HAVE YOU GONNA PUT THAT IN THE FACILITY FOR A WHILE AND A NEW CONTRACTOR COMES IN THEY'LL SAY ALL MAFIA DOLLAR FIFTY CENTS AN HOUR MORE. COME WORK WITH ME. DO YOU SEE THAT A LOT I I'VE NOT I'VE NOT SEEN THAT A LOT LOW WAGE WORK UNFORTUNATELY WITH WITH WITH. YOU RANK AND FILE WORKERS WITH SUPERVISORS OR MIGHT BE THAT ISSUE BUT THIS PROVIDES- INDIVIDUALS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVE THEMSELVES WHO ARE ALREADY BEEN WORKING AT THE FACILITY. JANUARY THE EIGHTH THAT'S BECAUSE LIKE IN THE ATTIC. SACRAMENTO CA. ATONG ANG SPECIALLY ON THE FRESH FRUIT- HAND PICK STUFF. WHERE THE BASE RATE WORKERS AND- AND FARMING THAT THAT HAVE IT DOWN OUR INCREDIBLE RIGHT SO YES I COULD SEE WHERE THAT'S A PROBLEM THIS IS- THIS WORK IS A DONE BY PIECE WHERE. THAT THAT JUST PROVIDE THE DIFFERENT INCENTIVE I THINK ANYONE IS THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT. YOU COULD BECAUSE- THE FAST REALLY PRODUCTIVE AS- OFTEN YOUNG- IT. HOOKING GET THEIR STRAWBERRY VERY QUICKLY YES THEY'RE VERY PRIZED- EMPLOYEES FOR EVEN THE HOUSE UNIT WITH. THE HOTEL CLEANERS I MEAN THERE'S PROBABLY YOUNG YOUNGER VIEW LOOKING CLEAN A LOT QUICKER GET MORE ROOMS DONE FASTER THAT IS RIGHT BUT THERE ARE GUIDEINES TO AYE AYE IN MOST HOTELS ON HOW MANY ROOMS THEY EXPECTED TO SHIFTED. IN AND THIS IS JUST AGAIN- PROVIDING AN OLDER. WOMEN OF COLOR WORKFORCE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE BECAUSE AFTER SIXTY DAYS THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMPETE THAT KEEP THEM IF THEY HAVE WORKPLACE OR PERFORMANCE ISSUES THEY DON'T HAVE TO KEEP THEM. THIS GIVES THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY THOUGH. WHAT THANK YOU ARMENIANS HAVE A MOTION- SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE RESULTS FASTER AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. SO ON A. B. A TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR OF THEM CENTURY POSSIBLE PLEASE. MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS KALRA FIVE KALRA I FLOOR NO FLOOR NO GONZALEZ. HI GONZALEZ SIDE JONES SAWYER STONE. ALL RIGHT STONE I SEE I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU ARE DON'T KNOW WORDS. FIVE WARD HI. BUT IS OUT THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIR PRESENTING AB SEVENTY TWO. WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. THE BILL THAT THANK YOU I THINK IT WAS SURE. THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN A TIME OF. A DIFFICULT AND GREAT AWAKENING- PLAYERS AND WORKERS IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY WERE HIT PARTICULARLY HARD AS COVER NINETEEN RESTRICTIONS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO STAY OPEN- MILLIONS OF JOBS LOST MANY OWNERS HAD TO PERMANENTLY SHUTTER THEIR BUSINESSES AND WORKERS A BILL LEFT FOR MONTHS WITHOUT. WORK OR A SAFETY NET. OF THE MORE THAN THIRTEEN MILLION RESTAURANT WORKERS THE UNITED STATES MAJORITY OF WOMEN JUST PORTION JUST FORTUNE NUMBER OF PEOPLE OF COLOR. ACTUALLY THE NATIONAL WAGE GAP OF NEARLY FIVE DOLLARS AN HOUR BETWEEN BLACK WOMEN AND WHITE MEN WHO HOLD TIPPED IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. IS OFTEN THE RESULT OF HIRING DISCRIMINATION IMPLICIT BIAS AND OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND THE INDUSTRY. I AM PROUD TO PRESENT EIGHTY FIVE SEVENTY TWO WHICH WILL DIRECT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO ESTABLISH A PROGRAM TO TRAIN RESTAURANT EMPLOYEES MANAGERS. EMPLOYERS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN THE WORK FORCE. AND IMPLEMENT A HIGH ROAD EMPLOYMENT POLICIES. UNDER THIS BILL THE BOARD WILL TAKE BIDS FROM COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES THAT PROMOTE WORKPLACE DIVERSITY. THE BILL RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF CREATING PATHWAYS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS WOMEN AND PEOPLE WHO ARE TRANSGENDER NON BINARY AND INTERSEX. RESTAURANTS HAVE COMPLETED THE TRAINING OF IMPLEMENTED THE HIGH ROAD EMPLOYMENT POLICIES. WILL BE CERTIFIED AS A HIGH ROAD RESTAURANT. AND BE ABLE TO ADVERTISE THEMSELVES AS SUCH. THIS BILL OF AFFECTED TO CREATE ANOTHER HYDRO TRAINING PARTNERSHIP AND BE PART OF A LARGER INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE A FIELD OF PROFITS THAT ADDRESSES INCOME INEQUALITY AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. HIERO TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE WORKER RETENTION UPSKILLING AND RESKILLING AND UTILIZE WORKER TO HELP SHAPE TRAINING PROGRAMS. WITH THESE HIGH ROAD TRAINING POLICIES IN PLACE WE CAN START TO REPLICATE RACIAL AND GENDER DISPARITIES IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. THAT PROMOTE EQUITY AMONG WORKERS I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE. THAT THERE WAS A LADY THAT WAS LAID OPPOSITION. OF INCUMBENT RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO ENGAGE AND LOOK FORWARD TO THAT ENGAGE AND I'M SURE THEY'LL BE. OTHER THING A FEW WORDS ALLOW AS WELL. OF ESPECIALLY AFTER I BOUGHT AND- BY TELEPHONE OF THE WE HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS OF MIKEY NAB.

ONE FAIR WAGE AND FOOD LABOR RESEARCH CENTER THAT WE- PUT ON THE ON YOUR DESK HERE. IS LITERALLY DATED TODAY'S DATE SO- THIS IS A NEW. ENDEAVOR BUT AGAIN- IT THAT THE IDEA IS THAT WE- ARE OFFERING TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESTAURANTS TO ENSURE THAT THEIR POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT. WITH THE HIGH ROAD EMPLOYMENT AND IF. OF THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION SAY THEY'RE ALREADY DOING A GREAT JOB THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF RESTAURANTS. THEY'RE GONNA QUITE EASILY QUALIFY AS I RODE PLAYERS. IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. THANK YOU- I JUST HAVE ONE COMMENT IT WILL ALSO MAKE COMMENTS- JUST HAVE ONE COMMENT BECAUSE- ON- IS BECAUSE THIS BILL AB TWO FIFTY SEVEN. ONE OF OUR CHIEF WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO THAT WAS MAKAYLA WHO IS A TRANSGENDER FRANCHISEE OWNER ONE OF THE LARGEST IN EL POLLO LOCO OWNERS. I THINK YOU HAVE A GREAT PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE ON. HOW TO MAKE THIS MORE EQUITABLE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. SO I DO THINK THAT THE RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION IS MOVING FORWARD I DID NOT A 100% SURE THAT THIS IS NECESSARY BUT I. I DO CAN I WISH TO MAKE A LIST ON THE PHONE LINE BECAUSE I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE HER PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THINK SHE WOULD BRING A VERY VERY FASCINATING PERSPECTIVE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID- ANYBODY ELSE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU AND TO THE POINT ACTUALLY AFFORD REACHING UP REACHING OUT TO MAKAYLA THAT OCCUR RIGHT AND IN FACT YOU KNOW MIKE UNITED WITH HIMSELF AS A RESTAURATEUR SO. WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN. FROM THOSE THAT ARE RUNNING THE RESTAURANTS THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROCESS AND- ONE THING I WOULD JUST SAY THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE- HONDA. PROCLUS IN ON ON THE LANGUAGE IN THE- IN THE FACT SHEET REGARDING SYSTEMIC RACISM. BY THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN THE FACTION IS THAT- STRUCTURAL RACISM STRANGLEHOLD THROUGHOUT ALL OF YOUR SOCIETY. THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IS NO EXCEPTION I WOULD CLAIM THAT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE RACISM IS. SOMETHING WE'RE ALL TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD FROM AND IMPROVE AND DO BETTER. AND I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT TO BE PROUD OF IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IS A TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS PROGRAM. TO DO THAT- AND TO USE THE GREAT DIVERSITY THAT'S ALREADY IN ARE IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE AND. AND TO HAVE A JOB THEIR PRODUCTS.
