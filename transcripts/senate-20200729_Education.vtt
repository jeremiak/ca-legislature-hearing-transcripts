00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.826
IN THE NATION. THE CSU IS ALSO

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:16.860
ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL

00:48:16.927 --> 00:48:19.096
INSTITUTIONS WITH THE STUDENT

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.631
BODY THAT IS THE MOST

00:48:20.697 --> 00:48:22.666
ETHNICALLY ECONOMICALLY AND

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.768
ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE IN THE

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:27.571
NATION. THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.973
IT IS OUR MISSION. BUT CSU

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.875
STRIVES TO CREATE A WELCOMING

00:48:31.942 --> 00:48:34.211
ENVIRONMENT WHICH PLACES

00:48:34.278 --> 00:48:35.779
EMPHASIS ON STUDENT SUCCESS.

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:37.114
THIS IS EVIDENT BY THE FACT

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.082
THAT THE CITY PROVIDES MORE

00:48:39.149 --> 00:48:40.217
THAN HALF OF ALL UNDERGRADUATE

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:41.952

AND THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.896
COLLEGE. THESE PERCENTAGES

00:48:52.963 --> 00:48:54.665
ILLUSTRATE THE LONGSTANDING

00:48:54.731 --> 00:48:56.600
WORK OF CSU ADMINISTRATORS

00:48:56.667 --> 00:48:59.703

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.114

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:15.952

QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL

00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:30.434
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.422
HIGHER EDUCATION BATTERS AND I

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:22.525
SO APPRECIATE AT AND ADMIRE.

01:04:22.592 --> 01:04:25.795
THAT LEADERSHIP. AND WHAT I'M

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:28.464
STRUGGLING WITH IS- YOU KNOW A

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.099
IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT- IN A

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.735
STATE AS LARGE AS CALIFORNIA. I

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.403
WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND

01:04:34.470 --> 01:04:36.806
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO ENSURE

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:39.208
THAT EVERYBODY IS AT THE TABLE

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.376
HI EVERYBODY IS AWARE AND

01:04:40.443 --> 01:04:42.845
INFORMED ITS CITY OF ITS

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:43.479
ONGOING CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.514
WITHIN OUR OWN. LEGISLATIVE

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.851
BODY BATTERS THAT WE- CONSIDER.

01:04:48.918 --> 01:04:51.754
UP BUT FOR ME IT SEEMS THAT THE

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:55.591
TRUSTEES. HAVE ENGAGED IN AN

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:57.760
OPEN TRANSPARENT WAY ON THIS

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.962
VERY DIFFICULT TOPIC. AND I

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:01.998
DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY MEMBER

01:05:02.064 --> 01:05:02.598
OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT

01:05:02.665 --> 01:05:05.468
DIFFERS. WITH THE CONCERNS THAT

01:05:05.534 --> 01:05:07.837
THE AUTHOR HAS RAISED ON THIS

01:05:07.903 --> 01:05:09.071
PARTICULAR MATTER THAT OF UNDER

01:05:09.138 --> 01:05:11.107
REPRESENTED STUDENTS AND

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.041
WHETHER OR NOT THIS NEW

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:13.442
REQUIREMENT WHICH- CREATES SOME

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:15.945
ELIGIBILITY CONCERNS I I'D I

01:05:16.012 --> 01:05:16.679
THINK EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.881
PAGE. AND SO FOR ME WHEN WE'RE

01:05:18.948 --> 01:05:21.384
TALKING ABOUT THESE THESE

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:23.185
ISSUES I ALWAYS TRY TO

01:05:23.252 --> 01:05:25.021
UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT. BUT

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.389
THERE'S A IT'S A COMPELLING

01:05:26.455 --> 01:05:28.557
REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:05:28.624 --> 01:05:31.294
END INTERVENE. AT ESTABLISH NEW

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.630

01:05:34.697 --> 01:05:38.801
LACK OF RUST. LACK OF HONESTY-

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:41.504
BUT WE HAVE SET UP THIS BOARD

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.139
OF TRUSTEES TO DO OUR- POLICY.

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.052
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.322
