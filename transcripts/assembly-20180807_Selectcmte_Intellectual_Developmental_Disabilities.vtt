CHANGES OF THE DECLINE IN THE

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:34.772
NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:37.375

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.866
SO IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AS A

00:35:01.933 --> 00:35:03.267
THERE IS A MORATORIUM OF

00:35:03.334 --> 00:35:04.602
EMISSIONS AND ALL DEVELOPMENTAL

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:06.437

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.809
OF NOTE IS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT

00:35:11.876 --> 00:35:12.710
INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST

00:35:12.777 --> 00:35:14.212
COMPLEX DEEDS BOTH WITH THE

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.680
BEHAVIOR CHALLENGES AS WELL AS

00:35:15.746 --> 00:35:16.914

WERE NO LONGER ADMITTED INTO A

00:35:18.483 --> 00:35:19.884
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER.

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:21.285
THIS WAS REALLY THE FOCUS THEN

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.620
ON LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE GOING

00:35:22.687 --> 00:35:23.488
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:35:23.554 --> 00:35:24.822
INDIVIDUALS WITH THE MOST

00:35:24.889 --> 00:35:25.823
COMPLEX DEEDS.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:27.391
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE

00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.660

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:31.829
DEVELOPED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS

00:35:31.896 --> 00:35:34.365
SOME OF THESE NEEDS --

00:35:34.432 --> 00:35:36.467

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.806
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER TASK FORCE

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.774
TO FOCUS ON INFORMING US ON WHAT

00:35:43.841 --> 00:35:45.009
WAS GOING TO BE THE FUTURE FOR

00:35:50.448 --> 00:35:52.116
PLAN FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:53.851
REMAINING DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

00:35:53.918 --> 00:35:55.353
THE CHANGE IN THE FOCUS OF THE

00:35:56.687 --> 00:35:57.922

I DO WANT TO GIVE YOU JUST A A

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:57.975

INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE.

00:37:59.310 --> 00:38:00.778

FOR US AS A SERVICE DELIVERY

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.048

MOVE FORWARD.

00:38:07.585 --> 00:38:08.586
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:09.887
POPULATION THAT WERE SURVEYED

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:11.856
TODAY BUT ALSO THE POPULATION

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:13.124
THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:14.558
SERVING IN THE FUTURE.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.293
I'M I HAD MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.395
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:18.095
THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT WE

00:38:18.162 --> 00:38:20.131
SERVE THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:21.432
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE SERVE WITHIN

00:38:21.499 --> 00:38:25.169
OUR POPULATION. 39% ARE HISPANIC

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.605
32% ARE WHITE 9% ARE AFRICAN

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.407
AMERICAN.

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:30.675
AND THE REST ARE WITHIN THE

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.376
DIFFERENT AND ETHNICITIES WE DO

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:33.644
HAVE A VERY VERY DIVERSE

00:38:33.711 --> 00:38:35.413
POPULATION WE HAVE TWENTY THREE

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.814
DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES AND OUR

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.516
POPULATION THAT WERE IDENTIFYING

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:39.884
SPEAKS ABOUT FORTY FIVE

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:42.553
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. 48% OF THE

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.255
CONSUMER POPULATION IS UNDER THE

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:48.426
AGE OF 2238% OF OUR POPULATION

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:51.195
HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF AUTISM. 80%

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.630
OF THE POPULATION LIVE AT HOME

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:54.165
OR WITH THEIR FAMILY OR IN THEIR

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:55.199
OWN INDEPENDENT LIVING ON

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:57.268
SETTING.

00:38:57.334 --> 00:38:58.969
WITHIN THAT THE CHANGES WE ARE

00:38:59.036 --> 00:39:01.205
SEEING ABOUT THIRTEEN TO

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:01.772
FOURTEEN THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

00:39:01.839 --> 00:39:03.007
INDIVIDUALS WITHIN OUR SERVICE

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.875
DELIVERY SYSTEM EACH YEAR.

00:39:04.942 --> 00:39:06.911
SO SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:09.213
CURRENT YEAR WE'VE SEEN A 42%

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.215
INCREASE IN OUR POPULATION.

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.516
SIZE OF REGIONAL CENTERS VERY

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.518
BETWEEN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED AS

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.619
THE SMALLEST TO THE LARGEST

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:17.955
BEING.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:18.522
THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND YEP AN

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:20.658
ETHNICITY IS ALSO CHANGING WHERE

00:39:20.725 --> 00:39:22.760
WE'RE SEEING A SHIFT WORK. TEN

00:39:22.827 --> 00:39:23.994
YEARS AGO THIS SUMMER TO THE

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:26.497
CALIFORNIA ON DEMOGRAPHICS THAT

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:28.232
WE'RE SEEING CHANGES IS THAT 40%

00:39:28.299 --> 00:39:29.867
OF THE INDIVIDUALS OF THE

00:39:29.934 --> 00:39:32.670
POPULATION WAS WHITE BACK AND A

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:35.072
TEN YEARS AGO REPRESENTING.

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:37.007
THIRTEEN AT 32% TODAY WHERE THIS

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:38.442
IS CHANGING OUR HISPANIC

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:40.177
POPULATION NEXT INCREASING WHICH

00:39:40.244 --> 00:39:43.447
IS CHANGING FROM 33% 239%.

00:39:43.514 --> 00:39:44.949
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT AS WE

00:39:45.015 --> 00:39:46.150
CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPORTANT

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:47.618
DISCUSSION REGARDING THE

00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.153
INEQUITIES IN SPENDING WITHIN

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:50.488
THE DIFFERENT ON POPULATIONS

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:51.989
BETWEEN WHITE AND NOT WHITE AND

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:53.758
NON WHITE.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:54.892
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT THE

00:39:54.959 --> 00:39:56.460
GROWTH WITHIN THE POPULATION WE

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:58.596
ALSO KNOW THAT 50% OF THE

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:00.364
HISPANIC POPULATION WITH AND AND

00:40:00.431 --> 00:40:02.066
THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM IS

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:04.535
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO WERE

00:40:04.602 --> 00:40:06.303
ALSO SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.705
FAR AS THE GROWTH.

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.673
OF INDIVIDUALS WITH AUTISM. TEN

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:12.176
YEARS AGO APPROXIMATELY THIRTY

00:52:38.054 --> 00:52:39.489
CHALLENGES LOOKING AHEAD I'LL

00:52:39.556 --> 00:52:41.324
TRY NOT TO REPEAT --

00:52:41.391 --> 00:52:43.059
TOO MUCH OF WHAT DIRECTOR BARGE

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:43.894
BEEN PRESENTED --

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.896
BUT ALL OF MY COMMENTS WILL BE

00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:49.199
FROM SERVE A FISCAL PERSPECTIVE.

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:50.934
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE TWO OF THE

00:52:51.001 --> 00:52:51.868
HAND OUT.

00:52:51.935 --> 00:52:55.572
THE CURRENT DDS BUDGET IN.

00:52:55.639 --> 00:52:57.073
TWENTY IS AT A RECORD HIGH OF

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.875
SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:03.547
AND ABOUT 61% OF THIS COMES FROM

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:04.814
IF YOU ACTUALLY TURNED TO THE

00:53:04.881 --> 00:53:07.183
FIGURE ON PAGE THREE YOU'LL NOTE

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.618
THAT SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:11.388
RECENT YEARS IN THE DDS BUDGET

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:12.322
YOU'LL SEE THERE WAS SORT OF A

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:13.456
STALL.

00:53:13.523 --> 00:53:15.358
WHEN BUDGET CUTS HAD TO BE MADE

00:53:15.425 --> 00:53:16.927
DURING THE RECESSION?

00:53:16.993 --> 00:53:18.828
AND YOU ALSO NOTE THESE RAPID

00:53:18.895 --> 00:53:20.530
INCREASE IN CASE LOW GROWTH BUT

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.332
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:23.767
GROWTH IN THE DDS BUDGET

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.769
ACTUALLY OUT PIECES GROWTH IN

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:27.437
THE DDS CASELOAD AND THIS IS IN

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:29.339
PART -- DUE

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:31.641
TO CHANGES IN IN UTILIZATION OF

00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.577
SERVICES IT'S ALSO DUE IN LARGE

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:34.911
PART.

00:53:34.978 --> 00:53:36.246
TO THE STATEWIDE MINIMUM WAGE

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:38.181
INCREASES WHICH THE STATE HAS

00:53:38.248 --> 00:53:40.083
FUNDED FOR THE SERVICE PROVIDERS

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:42.852
IN THE DTS SYSTEM.

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:44.321
THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVES ITS

00:53:44.387 --> 00:53:45.655
FUNDING FROM THE STATE'S GENERAL

FUNDS AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:53:49.826 --> 00:53:50.560
FOUR YOU'LL SEE THE RELATIVE

00:53:50.627 --> 00:53:53.196
SHARES OF GENERAL FUND IN

00:53:53.263 --> 00:53:54.864

AS DIRECTOR PARCHMAN NOTED THE

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.425
THE RELATIVE BURDEN ON THE

00:54:22.492 --> 00:54:24.194
GENERAL FUND WAS REDUCED DURING

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:25.428
THE RECESSION WHILE THE

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:26.396
DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:27.931
SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASE

SINCE THAT TIME HOWEVER GENERAL

00:54:32.335 --> 00:54:35.405
FUND GROWTH HAS OUTPACED GROWTH --

00:54:35.472 --> 00:54:38.341
FROM FEDERAL SOURCES OF FUNDING.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.976
IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:42.345
THIS DISCUSS THE TWO MAJOR

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.780

FINALLY THERE ARE THE SAFETY NET

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.966
AND CRISIS SERVICES THAT HAVE

00:56:43.032 --> 00:56:44.567
ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED.

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:45.869
A PARTICULARLY AS THE

SERVICES OUT IN COMMUNITY BASED

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:53.777
FACILITIES --

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.812
THERE IT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO PAY

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.113
ATTENTION --

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.914
TO MAKING SURE THERE ARE ENOUGH

00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:01.217
RESOURCES FOR THOSE PURPOSES.

00:57:01.284 --> 00:57:02.552
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN WE'D

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:04.154
LIKE TO BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE

00:57:04.220 --> 00:57:05.622
IMPACT THAT THE CLOSURE OF

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.223
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS WILL HAVE

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.492
ON THE DTS BUDGET.

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:10.860
IT'S GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT

00:57:10.927 --> 00:57:12.796
IT'S LESS EXPENSIVE TO SERVE

00:57:12.862 --> 00:57:14.898
PEOPLE IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS

00:57:14.964 --> 00:57:16.065
THAN IT IS TO RUN.

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:18.635
INSTITUTIONS --

00:57:18.701 --> 00:57:20.470
HOWEVER AND THERE ARE SOME

00:57:20.537 --> 00:57:22.172
SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:24.007
WITH CLOSING THESE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:57:24.073 --> 00:57:25.675

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:27.443
THE FIRST ARE THE COMMUNITY

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:30.446
PLACEMENT COSTS OF THIS DOES A

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:32.282
DTS HAS BEEN PROVIDED --

00:57:32.348 --> 00:57:34.083
FUNDING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:35.451
FUNDING OVER THE PAST NUMBER OF

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.120
YEARS TO BEGIN DEVELOPING

00:57:37.187 --> 00:57:38.555
RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR

00:57:38.621 --> 00:57:40.557
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING.

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:41.457
OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

00:57:41.524 --> 00:57:43.960
IN IN INTO COMMUNITY HOMES.

00:57:44.027 --> 00:57:45.662
AND THEY ALSO HAVE TO PAY FOR

00:57:45.728 --> 00:57:47.463
JUST THE CUT COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.998
WITH TRANSITIONING THOSE FOLKS

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:50.567
INTO THE COMMUNITY.

00:57:50.633 --> 00:57:52.502
THERE'S ALSO THE COST TO DEVELOP

00:57:52.569 --> 00:57:54.037
THE SAFETY NET IN THE COMMUNITY

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.205
NOW THAT DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.006
WILL NO LONGER BE THAT PLACE OF

00:57:57.073 --> 00:57:57.974
LAST RESORT FOR CONSUMERS IN

00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.443
CRISIS.

IF YOU TURN TO PAGE.

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:03.713
EIGHT WE DO OUR OFFICE DOES

00:58:03.780 --> 00:58:05.348
ESTIMATE HOWEVER THAT THERE WILL

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.217
BE SOME NET SAVINGS TO THE

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.118
SYSTEM ONCE THE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:58:09.185 --> 00:58:10.854
CENTERS ARE FINALLY CLOSED.

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:13.056
WE ESTIMATE THAT IN TERMS OF

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:14.724
OPERATIONAL COSTS THE STATE

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:16.626
COULD SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED

00:58:16.693 --> 00:58:18.261
MILLION DOLLARS AT MOST FROM THE

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:21.831
GENERAL FUND RELATIVE TO THE

00:58:21.898 --> 00:58:22.699
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET ONCE

THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS ARE

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:24.801
CLOSED.

00:58:24.868 --> 00:58:27.804
THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY

00:58:27.871 --> 00:58:29.439
THAT REVENUES COULD BE RAISED

00:58:29.505 --> 00:58:31.608
THROUGH THE SET SALE OR LEASE OF

00:58:31.674 --> 00:58:33.676
THE PROPERTIES WHICH THE DECIES

00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:34.978
ARE HOUSE JOHN --

00:58:35.044 --> 00:58:36.980
BUT THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WILL

00:58:37.046 --> 00:58:38.281
BE HIGHLY --

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:40.049
DEPENDENT ON THE INDIVIDUAL

00:58:40.116 --> 00:58:41.451
CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH OF THOSE

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:43.486
PROPERTIES AS WELL AS DECISIONS

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:44.888
THAT ARE MADE BY THE VARIOUS.

00:58:44.954 --> 00:58:46.723
A GOVERNMENTAL STAKEHOLDERS

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:50.960
INCLUDING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

00:58:51.027 --> 00:58:53.563
ON PAGE NINE I I WON'T GO INTO

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:54.998
ALL OF THESE SINCE I'M DIRECTOR

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:57.100
BURGE MEN DID ADDRESS A NUMBER

00:58:57.166 --> 00:58:58.501
OF THESE --

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:00.737
THESE ITEMS BUT WE WANTED TO

00:59:00.803 --> 00:59:01.537
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MAJOR

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:02.872
BUDGET ACTIONS THAT HAVE

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:04.641
OCCURRED OVER THE PAST FIFTEEN

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:06.209
YEARS --

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:07.977
FIRST TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:09.779
BUDGET SOLUTIONS --

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:11.080
THAT WERE MADE DURING THE RECENT

00:59:11.147 --> 00:59:13.516
ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS.

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.218
AND THERE WAS A NAMELY A

00:59:15.285 --> 00:59:16.619
REDUCTION IN BENEFITS IN TERMS

00:59:16.686 --> 00:59:19.622
OF TIGHTENING THE ELIGIBILITY

00:59:19.689 --> 00:59:21.424
CRITERIA IN THE EARLY START

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.626
PROGRAM AND THIS WAS IN ORDER TO

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:25.662
REDUCE CASELOAD.

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:26.195
GROWTH --

00:59:26.262 --> 00:59:28.031
AND THAT'S REDUCE COST THAT

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:31.100
ELIGIBILITY WAS RESTORED --

00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.670
IN BEGINNING IN.

00:59:33.736 --> 00:59:34.470
TWENTY FIFTEEN SOCIAL A

00:59:34.537 --> 00:59:36.339
RECREATION CAMP SERVICES WERE

00:59:36.406 --> 00:59:37.874
SUSPENDED AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.575
RESTORED --

00:59:39.642 --> 00:59:41.411
EN RESPITE THE AMOUNT OF RESPITE

00:59:41.477 --> 00:59:43.646
THAT AN INDIVIDUAL COULD RECEIVE

00:59:43.713 --> 00:59:46.049
WAS LIMITED --

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:48.384
THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:59:48.451 --> 00:59:49.886
BUDGET DID RESTORE THE FULL

00:59:49.953 --> 00:59:51.487
AMOUNT OF A RESPITE TO ANY

00:59:51.554 --> 00:59:54.824
INDIVIDUAL.

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:55.992
AND THERE WERE ALSO WHAT WERE

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:58.394
CALLING RESTRICTIONS TO VENDOR

00:59:58.461 --> 00:59:59.796
RATES THE MOST IMPORTANT OF

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:01.898
THESE WERE RATE FREEZES SOME OF

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:05.301
WHICH STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:06.502
THREE FOUR AND AFFECTING SOME

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:10.540
VENDORS AND THEN OTHERS IN --

01:00:10.606 --> 01:00:11.140
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT NINE THESE

01:00:11.207 --> 01:00:12.909
FREEZES STILL REMAIN IN PLACE

01:00:12.976 --> 01:00:14.677
DESPITE THE STATE PROVIDING

01:00:14.744 --> 01:00:16.279
FUNDING TO COVER THE COSTS

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.047
ASSOCIATED WITH STATE MINIMUM

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:20.350
WAGE INCREASES --

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:23.453
AND OF THE THE RATE INCREASES

01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:25.722
THAT OCCURRED IN.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:26.889
TWENTY SIXTEEN I WE WOULD ALSO

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:28.391
NOTE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.260
MEDIAN RATES HAS ALSO RESTRICTED

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:32.962
THE AMOUNT THAT VENDORS RECEIVE

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:34.964
SO THE MEDIAN RATES ARE

01:00:35.031 --> 01:00:36.332
ESSENTIALLY --

01:00:36.399 --> 01:00:38.468
THE RATES THAT A NEW VENDOR

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:39.068
COMING INTO THE SYSTEM WOULD

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:41.070
RECEIVE RATHER THAN BEING ABLE

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.372
TO NEGOTIATE THEIR RATE BASED ON

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.007
IT ON COST.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.542
THEY HAVE TO ACCEPT THE CURRENT

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.044
STATEWIDE MEDIAN RATE FOR THAT

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.946
SERVICE OR THE REGIONAL CENTER

01:00:50.013 --> 01:00:51.514
AREA RATE FOR THAT SERVICE

01:00:51.581 --> 01:00:53.850
WHICHEVER OF THE TWO IS LOWER.

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.251
THAT MEDIAN RATE POLICY REMAINS

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.620
IN PLACE.

01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:59.956
ON PAGE TEN WE MENTION --

01:01:00.023 --> 01:01:01.958
SEVERAL OTHER SORT OF BUDGET

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.726
SOLUTIONS THAT ABOUT THAT

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.461
OCCURRED DURING THE RECENT

01:01:05.528 --> 01:01:07.063
RECESSION --

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.364
SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RESTORED

01:01:08.431 --> 01:01:09.766
LIKE PAYMENT REDUCTIONS.

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.868
THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE WAS

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.103
ONE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN TWO

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.140
THOUSAND NINE AND TO ESSENTIALLY --

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.408
BUT DESPITE IT BEING CALLED THE

01:01:18.474 --> 01:01:19.575
UNIFORM HOLIDAY POLICY WOULD

01:01:19.642 --> 01:01:20.843
ESSENTIALLY MEANT WAS THAT

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:21.911
REGIONAL CENTERS WERE PROHIBITED

01:01:21.978 --> 01:01:23.346
FROM PAYING.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.281
FIRST A VENDORS FOR SERVICES

01:01:25.348 --> 01:01:27.150
PROVIDED ON FOURTEEN SET DAYS

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.184
PER YEAR.

01:01:28.251 --> 01:01:30.119
THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:31.287
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THE

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.256
ADMINISTRATION HAD PROPOSED

01:01:33.322 --> 01:01:34.490
BEGINNING TO RIP TO ENFORCE THIS

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:36.559
POLICY AGAIN IT'S BEEN SUSPENDED

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.094
SINCE.

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:38.895
TWENTY FIFTEEN THE LEGISLATURE

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:40.963
HAD VOTED TO REPEAL THE POLICY

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.632
ALL TOGETHER THE COMPROMISE THAT

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:44.033
WAS REACHED WAS TO DELAY

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:45.001
ENFORCEMENT OF THE POLICY FOR

01:01:45.068 --> 01:01:47.804
ONE MORE YEAR.

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:49.505
SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:50.673
AUGMENTATIONS --

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.675
WE DON'T NEED TO GO INTO TOO

01:01:52.742 --> 01:01:54.143
MUCH DEPTH ON NEEDS BUT YOU'LL

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.880
NOTE AND AND PAGE.

01:01:57.947 --> 01:01:59.082
ELEVEN THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:02.185
WERE TAKEN DURING THE TWENTY

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.186
SIXTEEN SPECIAL SESSION OF THE

01:02:03.252 --> 01:02:04.487
LEGISLATURE SOME OF THESE

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.354
INVOLVED.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:08.624
RE INCREASES FOR VENDORS A AND I

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:09.992
AND INCREASES TO REGIONAL CENTER

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:12.829
OPERATIONS THERE ALSO SOME FIXED

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.163
ALLOCATIONS PROVIDED FOR SOME

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:15.698
SPECIFIC PURPOSES SUCH AS

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:18.367
AMELIORATING THE DISPARITIES IN

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:19.836
PURCHASE OF SERVICE SPENDING

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:22.505
ACROSS RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS --

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.174
AMONG A D. S. CONSUMERS.

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.709
THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN BUDGET

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.978
RESTORED RESPITE --

01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:30.646
AND PROVIDED ONE TIME FUNDING

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:33.249
FOR SAFETY NET DEVELOPMENT THE

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:33.749
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:35.751
PROVIDED. TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.787
WHAT'S CALLED BRIDGE FUNDING AND

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:39.021
THIS IS FOR VENDORS WHO ARE BE

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.990
BEING PARTICULIER PARTICULARLY

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:43.059
HARD HIT BY RISING COSTS AND

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:44.694
IT'S MEANT TO BRIDGE THE THE

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.295
TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:48.197
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RATE

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.532
STUDY CAN BE POTENTIALLY

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:52.201
IMPLEMENTED --

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:55.271
ON PAGES TWELVE THROUGH --

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:55.905
FOURTEEN WE WANTED TO NOTE SOME

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:59.809
OF THE LOOKING AHEAD AND I WON'T

01:02:59.876 --> 01:03:01.310
DWELL TOO LONG --

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:02.845
IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE DIRECTOR

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.480
BRIDGMAN DID ALREADY DISCUSSED

01:03:04.547 --> 01:03:06.849
SOME OF THESE AND I KNOW SOME OF

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:08.651
THE PANELISTS COMING FOR REMOVAL

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.453
WILL TALK ABOUT THESE BUT WE

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:12.622
JUST WANTED TO NOTE TWO FACTORS

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.223
THAT ARE CAUSING SHIFTS IN THE

01:03:14.290 --> 01:03:16.259
DTS SYSTEM. ONE AS THE SHIFTING

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.727
DEMOGRAPHICS WHICH WILL BE

01:03:17.793 --> 01:03:19.795
DISCUSSED AGAIN BUT WE WOULD

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:20.696
JUST NOTE FROM A FISCAL

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.765
PERSPECTIVE EACH OF THESE SHIPS

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.033
COMES WITH.

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:26.469
SORT OF FISCAL PRESSURE SO FOR

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:28.437
EXAMPLE OF THE RISE IN THE

01:03:28.504 --> 01:03:30.306
NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WITH AUTISM

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:33.075
AND DUAL MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS.

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.410
MEANS IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.579
SERVE THESE CONSUMERS THEN MAYBE

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.047
A OF MORE AVERAGE CONSUMER FROM

01:03:38.114 --> 01:03:40.316
THE PAST.

01:03:40.383 --> 01:03:41.517
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.319
EVOLVING MODES OF SERVICE

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:44.954
DELIVERY AS THE DIRECTOR ALREADY

01:03:45.021 --> 01:03:47.256
DISCUSSED A PAGE THIRTEEN NOTES

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:48.224
A FEW OF THESE DE

01:03:48.291 --> 01:03:50.359
INSTITUTIONALIZATION AND MOVING

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:52.228
TO A A SYSTEM THAT'S ALMOST A

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:53.963
100% COMMUNITY BASED.

01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:55.731
THE NEW FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:57.133
THAT THE STATEMENTS COMPLY WITH

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.234
IN ORDER TO CONSTRUCTING TEN

01:03:58.301 --> 01:03:59.702
YEAR RECEIVING FEDERAL FUNDING

01:03:59.769 --> 01:04:01.604
WHICH REALLY TRIES TO INCREASE

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.339
INTEGRATION OF CONSUMERS AND TO

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.440
THE COMMUNITY.

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.242
AND THE NEW SELF DETERMINATION

01:04:06.309 --> 01:04:09.979
PROGRAM THAT IS BEING ROLLED OUT.

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.215
I WE WOULD NOTE AS HAS ALREADY

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:13.149
BEEN DISCUSSED THERE'S THE

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:15.751
UPCOMING RATE STUDY. ONE OF THE

01:04:15.818 --> 01:04:17.386
REASONS FOR THE STUDY IS THAT

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:18.588
THE RATES STRUCTURE IN THE DTS

01:04:18.654 --> 01:04:20.022
SYSTEM.

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:21.457
IS VERY COMPLEX IT'S EVEN

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.459
COMPLEX ON PAPER JUST HOW --

01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:26.896
AND RATES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SET

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:28.164
THERE'S ANY NUMBER OF WAYS THAT

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.599
RATES CAN BE SET THERE'S MORE

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:30.700
THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SERVICE

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.235
CODES.

01:04:32.301 --> 01:04:33.502
BUT THIS STRUCTURE HAS BEEN MADE

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:35.338
EVEN MORE COMPLICATED BY THE

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.940
BUDGET SOLUTIONS AND SUBSEQUENT

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.209
ATTEMPTS TO AUGMENT AND RESTORE

01:04:40.276 --> 01:04:43.012
THE DDS BUDGET SINCE THAT TIME.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:44.313
I IT'S MADE --

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.881
FOR RATE STRUCTURE THAT IS IN.

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.817
THAT'S IN EQUITABLE ACROSS

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:49.218
VENDORS PROVIDING THE SAME

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:50.720
SERVICES.

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:53.089
IT'S UNSUSTAINABLE IN THE SENSE

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:53.956
THAT --

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.858
NUMBER OF VENDORS ARE STRUGGLING

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.760
FINANCIALLY AND IT PROVIDES A

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.962
DISINCENTIVE TO NEW VENDORS

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.265
COMING INTO THE SYSTEM --

01:05:02.331 --> 01:05:04.300
AND IT'S AND IT'S QUITE RIGID SO

01:05:04.367 --> 01:05:06.202
THE REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:07.670
PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THIS RATE

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.438
STUDY WAS REALLY TO ASSESS THE

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:10.973
STRUCTURE --

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.277
AND A EVALUATE DIFFERENT

01:05:14.343 --> 01:05:16.212
METHODOLOGIES FOR SETTING RATES

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.747
AND THEN HOPEFULLY PROVIDE SOME

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:20.016
GOOD ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:23.486
FOR SIMPLIFYING THE STRUCTURE --

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:25.021
FINALLY ON PAGE FOURTEEN WE

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.155
WOULD JUST NOTE --

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:28.157
A COUPLE OTHER ISSUES FACING THE

01:05:28.224 --> 01:05:29.225
SYSTEM --

01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.294
ONE IS THIS NOTION OF DEVELOPING

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.162
RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:05:33.229 --> 01:05:34.463
I HOUSING HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:05:34.530 --> 01:05:36.699
MENTIONED AS AS A PROBLEM BUT

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.634
THERE THE REGIONAL CENTERS AND

01:05:38.701 --> 01:05:39.769
VENDORS HAVE REALLY BEEN

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:42.038
RESTRICTED FROM STARTING UP NEW

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.939
PROGRAMS IN RECENT YEARS DUE TO

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.908
FUNDING CHALLENGES --

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:50.279
AND IN SEVENTEEN THE SEVENTEEN

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:52.014
EIGHTEEN BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:53.816
AND GOVERNOR PROVIDED --

01:05:53.883 --> 01:05:56.719
DDS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO USE

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.354
THE THE PART OF FUNDING THAT

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.656
THEY GET TO DEVELOP RESOURCES IN

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.867

MINIMUM WAGES --

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:37.360
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY ALSO MAKES IT

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:38.894
HARD TO GET NEW VENDORS INTO THE

INTO COORDINATING THIS HEARING.

01:21:50.605 --> 01:21:52.540
BEFORE I MOVE ON I WANT TO TAKE

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:54.776
A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON SOMETHING

01:21:54.843 --> 01:21:55.543
THAT DIRECTOR PARCHMAN SAID

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.844
[inaudible]

01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:57.412
THAT.

01:21:57.479 --> 01:21:59.314
CALIFORNIA'S SYSTEM FOR SERVING

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.382
PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

01:22:00.448 --> 01:22:01.716
DISABILITIES IS DIFFERENT

01:22:01.783 --> 01:22:02.017
[inaudible]

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.852
THAT IT.

01:22:03.918 --> 01:22:05.654
WAS AND AT ITS INCEPTION A MODEL

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.889
FOR THE NATION.

01:22:07.956 --> 01:22:09.291
AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE

01:22:09.357 --> 01:22:11.159
OF WAYS THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.228
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FIRST AND

01:22:13.295 --> 01:22:15.230
FOREMOST WE HAVE NO WEIGHTLESS

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:17.365
FOR ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:18.900
IN VIRTUALLY EVERY OTHER STATE

01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:19.501
IN THE COUNTRY THERE ARE WAIT

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:20.802
LISTS [inaudible]

01:22:20.869 --> 01:22:23.605
AND THEY CAN BE A DECADE OR MORE

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.940
LONG.

01:22:26.007 --> 01:22:27.409
SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE MADE A

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:29.411
COMMITMENT TO EVERY ELIGIBLE

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:30.412
INDIVIDUAL IS A SIGNIFICANT

01:22:30.478 --> 01:22:33.848
THING.

01:22:33.915 --> 01:22:36.284
ADDITIONALLY IN.

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:36.918
NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THERE WAS A

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:38.086
COURT DECISION THAT SOLIDIFIED

01:22:38.153 --> 01:22:39.421
BUT NOT ONLY DO PEOPLE HAVE A

01:22:39.487 --> 01:22:40.989
RIGHT TO ENTRY INTO THE SYSTEM

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.857
BUT THEY HAVE A RIGHT. TO NEEDED

01:22:42.924 --> 01:22:44.626
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT STEM

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:45.493
FROM THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:48.396
DISABILITY.

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:49.798
ANOTHER WAY THAT OUR SYSTEM IS

01:22:49.864 --> 01:22:51.466
DIFFERENT IS THAT THERE IS

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:54.269
INTENTIONAL LOCAL CONTROL WHICH

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:57.439
IS INTENDED TO ALLOW.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.207
AIR EACH AREA OF THE STATE TO

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:00.442
DRIVE SERVICE DELIVERY THAT

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:02.711
FEELS BEST THAT IS THE BEST

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.279
CULTURAL FIT FOR THEIR AREA.

01:23:04.346 --> 01:23:05.447
BUT IT ALSO ENABLES REGIONAL

01:23:05.513 --> 01:23:08.249
CENTERS TO BE MORE NIMBLE AND

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:12.153
AGILE THAN A STATE AGENCY.

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.521
WE RECOGNIZED EARLY ON IN

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:14.923
CALIFORNIA BUT NOT ONE SIZE FITS

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.691
ALL.

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:17.659
BUT RATHER.

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:18.760
WE IS A SYSTEM NEED TO BE

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.863
RESPONSIVE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:23.998
WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.034
ARE EXPERTS IN THEIR OWN LIVES.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:27.936
AND THIS CONCEPT HAS COME TO THE

01:23:28.002 --> 01:23:29.504
FORWARD.

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:30.805
IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:33.341
RECENTLY RECOGNIZING THAT WE

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.043
NEED.

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.411
TO PLANNED FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVES

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:38.613
WITH THEM.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.281
IN A WAY THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.683
NOT ONLY WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:43.351
THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY BUT ALSO

01:23:43.418 --> 01:23:44.953
THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:46.254
THE PERSON.

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.188
THOSE THINGS THAT HELP THE

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:49.724
PERSON. TO WANT TO GET UP IN THE

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:50.859
MORNING AND TO WANT TO GREET THE

01:23:50.925 --> 01:23:54.696
DAY.

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.197
WE KNOW THAT DEMOGRAPHICS PLAY A

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:59.868
HUGE ROLE IN SERVICE DELIVERY.

01:23:59.934 --> 01:24:01.102
AS DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED AS

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:03.371
WELL AS MISS PETTITTE FROM THE

01:24:03.438 --> 01:24:06.541
LA SHOW.

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.443
OUR DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:10.812
HAVE SHIFTED SIGNIFICANTLY.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:12.147
AT THE INCEPTION OF OUR SYSTEM

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:14.182
FIFTY YEARS AGO.

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:16.851
OUR POPULATION WAS 75% WHITE AND

01:24:16.918 --> 01:24:18.820
10% HISPANIC.

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:21.389
AND TODAY WE'RE A RICH TAPESTRY

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:22.924
OF VARIOUS ETHNICITIES AND

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.959
BACKGROUNDS WITH OVER FORTY

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:26.094
LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE REGIONAL

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:28.897
CENTER SYSTEM.

01:24:28.963 --> 01:24:30.598
WE KNOW THAT [inaudible]

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:32.667
CULTURAL VALUES.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:35.537
DR DIFFERENT CHOICES.

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:39.774
WE KNOW THAT IN SOME CULTURES.

01:24:39.841 --> 01:24:41.643
THE PREFERENCE IS FOR TO

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:43.878
MAINTAIN INDIVIDUALS AT HOME.

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:45.847
AND AS MS SMITH SAID WE KNOW

01:24:45.914 --> 01:24:47.282
THAT.

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:48.817
IF THE CHOICE IS TO MAINTAIN

01:24:48.883 --> 01:24:50.318
YOUR LOVED ONE AT HOME.

01:24:50.385 --> 01:24:52.020
WE IS A SYSTEM HAVE TO FIND A

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:54.322
WAY TO SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.790
AND TO SUPPORT THAT FAMILY TO

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.091
WRAP OURSELVES AROUND THAT

01:24:57.158 --> 01:24:59.494
FAMILY TO ENABLE THEM.

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:02.831
TO MEET THEIR REQUIREMENTS. TO

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:07.268
KEEP THEIR LOVED ONE AT HOME.

01:25:07.335 --> 01:25:09.003
NO MATTER WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS.

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.339
THE ABSOLUTE GOAL MUST BE EQUAL

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:14.309
ACCESS TO SERVICES BETTER

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:16.177
VALUABLE AND THAT MEETS THE

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:17.712
NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT OUR

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:18.680
PRICE FROM THEIR DEVELOPMENTAL

01:25:18.746 --> 01:25:23.985
DISABILITY.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.620
AS BOTH DIRECTOR BARGE MEN AND

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.655
MISS PATRICK NOTED.

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.691
THE SYSTEM IS WORKING.

01:25:29.757 --> 01:25:32.193
TRY DIFFERENT THINGS TO SEA

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.828
WATER THOSE THINGS THAT ARE MOST

01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:36.931
RESPONSIVE TO DIFFERENT CULTURES.

01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:38.733
AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.235
NEED TO AS A STATE MAKE A

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:41.202
COMMITMENT TO FUND WHATEVER

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:43.104
WORKS.

01:25:43.171 --> 01:25:44.706
AND TO MAKE A LONG TERM

01:25:44.772 --> 01:25:45.273
COMMITMENT TO FUNDING THOSE

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.709
THING.

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.711
AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE.

01:25:49.777 --> 01:25:51.613
THAT PROGRESS IN THIS AREA TAKES

01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:51.913
[inaudible]

01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:54.048
TIME.

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:56.217
THAT THERE ARE BARRIERS THERE

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:58.653
ARE ISSUES RELATED TO SERVICE

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.121
DELIVERY SOME OF WHICH HAVE

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:02.223
NOTHING TO DO WITH.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.092
THE REGIONAL CENTER OR THEIR

01:26:04.158 --> 01:26:05.994
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:07.562
SO IT MAY BE THAT IN SOME

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.497
POPULATIONS.

01:26:09.564 --> 01:26:11.633
THERE ARE ISSUES AROUND OF

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:13.668
MISTRUST OF GOVERNMENT AND THE

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:14.302
BELIEF THAT REGIONAL CENTERS ARE

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:15.837
GOVERNMENT.

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.906
PARTICULARLY IN THIS ECONOMIC

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:18.473
I'M SORRY IN THIS POLITICAL

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:20.475
CULTURE.

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:21.609
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:24.946
NEED TO MEET PEOPLE'S NEEDS AND

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:25.613
WE NEED TO MEET THEM WHERE THERE

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:26.981
OUT RATHER THAN TRY TO PUT THEM

01:26:27.048 --> 01:26:31.085
INTO A BOX.

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:32.754
DIRECTOR BARGE MEN NOTED THAT

01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.622
THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM WAS

01:26:34.689 --> 01:26:36.991
INITIALLY DEVELOPED.

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:37.892
AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.395
INSTITUTIONAL CARE.

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:42.063
IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES WE HAD

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.465
OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND FIVE

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:45.166
HUNDRED PEOPLE AND STATE RUN

01:26:45.233 --> 01:26:46.067
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS HERE IN

01:26:46.134 --> 01:26:47.969
CALIFORNIA.

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.504
AND AS WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY

01:26:49.571 --> 01:26:54.776
THAT POPULATION IS DOWN TO UNDER.

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:55.476
FIVE HUNDRED AND IMPORTANT

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.111
TURNING POINT IN THE

01:26:57.178 --> 01:26:58.913
DEPOPULATION OF STATE

01:26:58.980 --> 01:27:01.015
INSTITUTIONS WAS THAT WHAT'S

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.517
KNOWN AS THE CAR FELT DECISION

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:04.252
IN THE EARLY NINETIES.

01:27:04.319 --> 01:27:05.954
WHICH LED TO THE STATE

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.255
COMMITTING TO NOT ONLY THE

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.023
MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OUT OF

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.625
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS.

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:11.926
BUT ALSO THE APPROPRIATE

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:13.194
DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE

01:27:13.261 --> 01:27:16.197
SERVICES. FOR INSTANCE

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:17.865
SUPPORTIVE LIVING SERVICES

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:20.034
FAMILY HOME AGENCIES WHERE AN

01:27:20.101 --> 01:27:22.537
INDIVIDUAL MOVES INTO.

01:27:22.604 --> 01:27:25.239
THE HOME OF ANOTHER FAMILY WHO

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:27.375
SUPPORTS NOT ALONE WHO SUPPORTS

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:30.411
NO MORE THAN TWO INDIVIDUALS.

01:27:30.478 --> 01:27:31.446
HOMES FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.214
CHILDREN [inaudible]

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.917
SUPPLEMENTAL STAFFING TO ENABLE

01:27:35.984 --> 01:27:37.218
REGIONAL CENTERS TO OFFER

01:27:37.285 --> 01:27:38.519
ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS TO KEEP

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.288
PEOPLE IN [inaudible]

01:27:40.355 --> 01:27:42.056
RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS.

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.625
AS WELL AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.093
THE COMMUNITY PLACEMENT PLAN

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:46.961
WHICH IS PROVIDED A FUNDING

01:27:47.028 --> 01:27:48.930
STRUCTURE TO ENABLE.

01:27:48.997 --> 01:27:50.231
THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEEDED

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:54.636
RESOURCES SINCE THAT TIME.

01:27:54.702 --> 01:27:56.170
WHILE THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OUT

01:27:56.237 --> 01:27:57.505
OF DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS IS

01:27:57.572 --> 01:27:59.240
IMPRESSIVE IN THE AGGREGATE WE

01:27:59.307 --> 01:28:01.342
NEED TO REMEMBER THAT IT'S DONE

01:28:01.409 --> 01:28:03.444
ONE SINGLE PERSON AT A TIME.

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.946
THE ABSOLUTE GOAL [inaudible]

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:06.948
IS.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:10.051
TO INSURER BUT EACH PERSON HAS

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.819
EVERYTHING THEY NEED THEIR FIRST

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:14.022
DAY IN THE COMMUNITY.

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:15.056
AND THAT THAT MOVEMENT

01:28:15.123 --> 01:28:15.356
[inaudible]

01:28:15.423 --> 01:28:17.291
ISN'T JUST.

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:18.826
MOVING THEM FROM ONE PLACE TO

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.528
ANOTHER BUT IT'S USED AS AN

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:21.362
OPPORTUNITY TO ENHANCE THEIR

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:25.233
LIVES THAT IS THE GOAL IT'S NOT

01:28:25.299 --> 01:28:25.933
THE SHUDDERING OF STATE.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.236
RUN FACILITIES IT IS THE

01:28:28.302 --> 01:28:35.143
ENHANCING OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:37.378
IN TERMS OF HOUSING.

01:28:37.445 --> 01:28:39.113
OUR POPULATION IS A LITTLE BIT

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.182
UNIQUE.

01:28:41.249 --> 01:28:43.051
WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC SET

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:45.053
ASIDES FOR DEVELOPMENTAL

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:47.255
DISABILITIES THERE'S NO SPECIAL

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.457
FUNDING STREAM AT THIS TIME.

01:28:49.524 --> 01:28:51.192
IN PART BECAUSE MOST OF OUR

01:28:51.259 --> 01:28:51.959
POPULATION DOESN'T KNOW ONE

01:28:52.026 --> 01:28:54.162
SHELTERED.

01:28:54.228 --> 01:28:55.129
IF AN INDIVIDUAL APPROACHES A

01:28:55.196 --> 01:28:57.965
REGIONAL CENTER AND REQUESTS

01:28:58.032 --> 01:28:58.266
[inaudible]

01:28:58.332 --> 01:29:00.868
SHELTER.

01:29:00.935 --> 01:29:02.870
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM

01:29:02.937 --> 01:29:06.107
TO MOVE INTO SETTINGS.

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.309
BUT WE KNOW [inaudible]

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:10.311
THAT.

01:29:10.378 --> 01:29:12.513
THERE ARE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:14.248
AND DIFFERENT INTERESTS IN TERMS

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:15.183
OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.951
TODAY.

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:18.553
IT MAYBE THAT LESS PEOPLE ARE

01:29:18.619 --> 01:29:20.888
SEEKING GROUP LIVING AND MORE

01:29:20.955 --> 01:29:23.725
ARE SEEKING INDEPENDENT LIVING.

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:24.792
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.861
REALLY SUPPORTS THIS.

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.129
IF WE THINK BACK TO JUST FIFTY

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:32.467
YEARS AGO.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:34.502
THE IDEA OF COMMUNITY THE IDEA

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.270
OF PROVIDING ANY OF THE SERVICES

01:29:36.337 --> 01:29:38.139
OUTSIDE OF A DEVELOPMENTAL

01:29:38.206 --> 01:29:42.577
CENTER WAS NOVEL AND YOU NEED.

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:44.612
AND WE HAVE EVOLVED SO THAT NOW

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.414
WE EXPECT AND THE PEOPLE WE

01:29:46.481 --> 01:29:48.182
SUPPORT EXPECT TO BE FULLY

01:29:48.249 --> 01:29:49.517
INCLUDED IN THEIR COMMUNITIES

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.252
AND THAT MEANS.

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:55.356
REGULAR HOUSING FOR MANY OF THEM.

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:56.724
CALIFORNIA HAS.

01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:58.226
THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN THE

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:59.827
NATION WHEN.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:00.995
KIT COST OF LIVING IS TAKEN INTO

01:30:01.062 --> 01:30:02.697
ACCOUNT.

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:04.398
HIGHEST INTERESTINGLY EN LA

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:09.570
COUNTY IN SANTA CRUZ COUNTY.

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:10.705
REGIONAL COST DIFFERENCES MAKE A

01:30:10.772 --> 01:30:13.007
HUGE DIFFERENCE.

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.208
AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN NOTED

01:30:14.275 --> 01:30:16.844
EARLIER.

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:20.248
ANY NO COUNTY IN THE STATE IS

01:30:20.314 --> 01:30:21.449
HOUSING AFFORDABLE FOR AN

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:23.618
INDIVIDUAL TO RENT EVEN A STUDIO

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:25.987
APARTMENT.

01:30:26.053 --> 01:30:30.057
WHO RELIES ON SSI?

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:30.691
DIRECTOR PARCHMENT EARLIER NOTED

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:34.796
THAT. ONE OF THE KEY PROMISES

01:30:34.862 --> 01:30:36.464
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:38.232
HAVE LONG PROMISED PEOPLE.

01:30:38.299 --> 01:30:40.668
IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN A

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:43.471
COMMUNITY OF THEIR CHOOSING.

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:45.439
BUT HOW DO WE DO THAT.

01:30:45.506 --> 01:30:46.440
IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEDICATED

01:30:46.507 --> 01:30:47.875
POOL OF DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:52.880
REAL HOUSING NEEDS.

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.749
ADDITIONALLY MISS MATH FROM THE

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:56.284
STATE COUNCIL NOTED THAT.

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:57.218
JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE LIVES AT

01:30:57.285 --> 01:30:58.553
HOME DOESN'T MEAN THAT'S ALWAYS

01:30:58.619 --> 01:31:00.621
THEIR CHOICE SO WE REALLY HAVE

01:31:00.688 --> 01:31:02.290
TO DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT.

01:31:02.356 --> 01:31:04.392
WHO IS NEEDING HOUSING AND FOR

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:06.627
WHOM [inaudible]

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:09.230
IS THE ON AFFORDABILITY OF

01:31:09.297 --> 01:31:11.465
HOUSING.

01:31:11.532 --> 01:31:12.333
IN THEIR WAY IN TERMS OF THEM

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:15.303
ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS.

01:31:15.369 --> 01:31:17.238
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE SERVICES

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.407
DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HOUSING

01:31:19.473 --> 01:31:20.007
ACCESS FOR THE GENERAL

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:23.211
POPULATION ARE OVERTAXED.

01:31:23.277 --> 01:31:25.546
IN MANY COUNTIES [inaudible]

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:27.782
HOUSING VOUCHERS THE WAITING

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:29.183
LIST FOR THOSE OPEN.

01:31:29.250 --> 01:31:31.819
ONCE A DECADE.

01:31:31.886 --> 01:31:33.988
AND THE INFLUX OF PEOPLE WHO

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:34.789
WERE INTERESTED IN THOSE

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:37.091
VOUCHERS.

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:39.093
IT'S SO SIGNIFICANT BUT THEY DO

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.328
A LOT OF REACH SOMETIMES JUST TO

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:43.130
GET ON THE WAITING LIST.

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:44.665
SO YOU MAY NOT AFTER WAITING A

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:46.334
DECADE EVEN GET ON THE WAITING

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.269
LIST FOR A HOUSING VOUCHER.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:50.238

SOLUTION FOR OUR POPULATION.

01:31:56.077 --> 01:31:57.511
IN TERMS OF THE SAFETY NET.

01:31:57.578 --> 01:31:59.780
WE KNOW THAT.

01:31:59.847 --> 01:32:02.016
AS MISS PETTITTE POINTED OUT.

01:32:02.083 --> 01:32:03.718
BUT CERTAIN POPULATIONS BUT

01:32:03.784 --> 01:32:05.686
MAKEUP ORDERED RICH DEMOGRAPHICS

01:32:05.753 --> 01:32:07.321
TODAY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE TO

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:09.390
SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY THOSE WITH

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.726

PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES.

01:32:15.897 --> 01:32:17.732
TODAY IN THE COMMUNITY BASED

01:32:17.798 --> 01:32:20.301
SYSTEM OF 11% OF PEOPLE HAVE A

01:32:31.078 --> 01:32:35.383
AND 5% OUR TECHNOLOGY DEPENDENT.

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:36.684
SINCE TWENTY TWELVE WHEN THERE

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.119
WAS A MORATORIUM PUT ON

01:32:38.185 --> 01:32:39.820
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER PLACEMENTS

01:32:39.887 --> 01:32:40.688
EXCEPT BRING VERY LIMITED

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.657
SITUATIONS.

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.125
THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS CAN NO

LONGER SERVICE THE BACKSTOP WHEN

SOMEONE IS STRUGGLING TO

MAINTAIN COMMUNITY PLACEMENT.

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:53.935
A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE. TO

01:32:54.001 --> 01:32:55.436
DEVELOP COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO

01:32:55.503 --> 01:32:58.272
MEET THESE NEEDS.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:00.675
SPECIFICALLY A CONTINUUM OF CARE

01:33:00.741 --> 01:33:01.742
FOR CHANGES IN BEHAVIORAL

01:33:01.809 --> 01:33:03.144
STABILITY.

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:05.279
RECOGNIZING THAT.

01:33:05.346 --> 01:33:08.449
WHAT SOMEONE NEEDS? TO RIP TO

01:33:08.516 --> 01:33:09.750
MAINTAIN THEIR BEHAVIORAL

01:33:09.817 --> 01:33:11.218
STABILITY TODAY MAY LOOK

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.553
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY REQUIRE

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.621
A YEAR FROM NOW.

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:14.989
AND THAT OUR SYSTEM HAS TO BE

01:33:15.056 --> 01:33:17.558
FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO RESPOND TO

01:33:17.625 --> 01:33:19.293
THOSE INCREASES AS WELL AS

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:23.965
DECREASES IN SUPPORT MEANS.

01:33:24.031 --> 01:33:26.434
ALL OF THESE POPULATIONS REQUIRE

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:28.102
MORE REGIONAL CENTER STAFF TIME

01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.437
FOR SERVICE COORDINATION

01:33:29.503 --> 01:33:33.741

01:33:33.808 --> 01:33:35.242
AND JUST BRIEFLY BEFORE A WRAP

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:37.278
UP I WANT TO JUST NOTE THAT

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:38.913
WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF INFORMATION

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:39.680
ABOUT.

01:33:39.747 --> 01:33:41.115
THE FUNDING CHALLENGES THAT THE

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:47.421
MISS PATRICK NOTED THAT OUR ROOM

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:49.056
CURRENT RATE STRUCTURE WITH ITS

01:33:49.123 --> 01:33:50.825
MEDIAN RATES.

01:33:50.891 --> 01:33:52.493
IS INEQUITABLE UNSUSTAINABLE AND

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:57.264
RIGID.

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:58.933
THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT IMPACT

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.935
DOES THIS HAVE ON REAL PEOPLE ON

01:34:01.002 --> 01:34:03.704
THOSE THREE HUNDRED TWENTY

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.505
THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:08.442
SUPPORTED BY THE SYSTEM TODAY.

01:34:08.509 --> 01:34:10.444
WE KNOW THAT THE DIRECT WORKS

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.380
THAT'S DONE WITH INDIVIDUALS IS

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:16.017
OFTEN PAID AT MINIMUM WAGE.

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:17.251
AND THAT THOSE JOBS ARE REALLY

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:19.820
COMPLEX ESPECIALLY AS WE EXPECT

01:34:19.887 --> 01:34:21.355
THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE GREATER

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:23.157
OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS THE ROOT

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:25.359
COMMUNITY AT LARGE.

COUPLE OF TIMES THE IMPORTANCE

01:34:28.496 --> 01:34:31.832
OF CONSISTENCY IN STAFFING.

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:33.467
AND IF WE AS A SYSTEM CAN'T PAY

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:34.802
MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE

01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:37.405
CONSISTENCY IS INCREDIBLY HARD

01:34:37.471 --> 01:34:41.042
TO MAINTAIN OR ACHIEVE.

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.710
WE NEED TO IDENTIFY A WAY TO NOT

01:34:42.777 --> 01:34:44.178
ONLY PAY MORE ROBUST WAGES FOR

01:34:44.245 --> 01:34:46.047
THESE POSITIONS.

01:34:46.113 --> 01:34:47.381
BUT TO ENSURE THAT THIS IS A

01:34:47.448 --> 01:34:48.983
CAREER TRACK.

01:34:49.050 --> 01:34:51.152
BUT PEOPLE WILL STAY AND SEE

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.820
PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

01:34:52.887 --> 01:34:53.120

THE RATE STUDY.

01:35:04.231 --> 01:35:06.033
AS WE'VE HEARD IS --

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.268
THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:09.437
ARE DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:13.541

01:35:21.782 --> 01:35:24.118
IS NICE.

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.853
BUT THERE HAS TO BE A COMMITMENT.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.889
TO TAKE THAT NEXT STEP

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:29.190

01:35:59.153 --> 01:36:01.188
WAY TO KEEP THOSE RESOURCES IN

01:36:01.255 --> 01:36:02.656
OUR COMMUNITY.

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:05.192
AND TO STABILIZE OUR SYSTEM NOT

01:36:05.259 --> 01:36:06.227
ONLY FOR NOW BUT FOR FUTURE

01:36:06.293 --> 01:36:10.231
GENERATIONS [inaudible]

01:36:10.297 --> 01:36:12.032
IN CLOSING.

01:36:12.099 --> 01:36:13.667
WE'VE SEEN MANY CHANGES OVER THE

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:14.935
LAST FIFTY YEARS IN OUR SERVICE

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:18.005
SYSTEM.

01:36:18.072 --> 01:36:19.306

[inaudible]

01:36:19.673 --> 01:36:21.509

01:36:32.853 --> 01:36:33.420
BUT WE ONLY HAVE THE TOOLS TO DO

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:36.323
IT.

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.957
THANK YOU AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO

THIS DRAWING OF A QUESTIONS OF

01:36:39.994 --> 01:36:41.896
OUR PANELISTS [inaudible]

01:36:41.962 --> 01:36:45.232
SO.

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:46.433
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE --

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:48.469
STAFFING LEVELS OF THE REGIONAL

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:49.570
CENTERS UP AS A WHOLE Y. KNOW

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:52.306
EACH ONE HAS ITS OWN DYNAMIC --

01:36:52.373 --> 01:36:55.676
IS THERE A GENERAL --

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:56.744
NUMBER THE YOU HAVE THAT WOULD

01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:58.812
ACTUALLY.

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.948
SO WHAT KIND OF STAFFING LEVELS

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:04.752
YOU EITHER DEFICIENT ARE IN AND

01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:06.554
WHAT YOU WOULD NEED TO DO CUT

01:37:06.620 --> 01:37:08.355
ICE I SEE THAT THE THE THE AREA

01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:09.957
THAT SERVICE LEVEL ARE AREAS ARE

01:37:10.024 --> 01:37:12.860
VERY LARGE.

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:14.028
AND SO WHAT WOULD.

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:14.628
TWENTY ONE CENTERS THROUGHOUT

01:37:14.695 --> 01:37:16.630
FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES --

01:37:16.697 --> 01:37:18.132
SO ZERO SERVICE LEVEL THAT

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:20.701
YOU'RE AT NOW THAT --

01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:22.136
PICTURE YOU CAN STATE.

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:23.804
PROBABLY THE GREATEST INDICATOR

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:25.539
THE MOST VISIBLE ONE IS CASELOAD

01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:29.076
RATIOS THERE'S A STATUTORY --

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:31.445
COMMITMENT TO CASELOAD RATIOS

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:35.716
THAT FOR SOME POPULATIONS IS ONE

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:36.217
TO SIXTY TWO ONE SERVICE

01:37:36.283 --> 01:37:37.818
COORDINATOR FOR EVERY SIXTY TO

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:39.153
INDIVIDUAL SUPPORTED.

01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:42.790
AND FOR OTHERS IS --

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:44.225
ONE TO SIXTY SIX DEPENDING ON

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:46.193
FEDERAL FUNDING STREAMS.

01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:49.530
AND BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MOVED

01:37:49.597 --> 01:37:51.365
FROM DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS MOST

01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:53.300
RECENTLY IT'S ONE TO FORTY FIVE

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:55.769
TODAY THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE IS

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.538
ABOUT -- ONE

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.440
TO SEVENTY FOUR WHICH IF YOU

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:00.941
LOOK AT THE JOB OF A SERVICE

01:38:01.008 --> 01:38:03.377
COORDINATOR.

01:38:03.444 --> 01:38:06.013
THE JOB HAS BECOME MORE COMPLEX

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.415
IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE FEDERAL

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.017
DOLLARS FLOWING INTO THE SYSTEM

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.085
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.620
REQUIRES IN TENTS OF

01:38:12.686 --> 01:38:14.755
DOCUMENTATION.

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:16.290
IT USED TO BE THAT SERVICE

01:38:16.357 --> 01:38:18.125
COORDINATORS GOT TO SPEND A LOT

01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.127
MORE TIME WITH PEOPLE IN THEIR

01:38:20.194 --> 01:38:21.895
FAMILIES GETTING TO KNOW THEM

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:22.963
GETTING TO KNOW THEIR UNIQUE

01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:24.298
DYNAMICS.

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:26.200
AND THE JOBS HAVE BECOME

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.635
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE

01:38:27.701 --> 01:38:28.702
ADMINISTRATIVE AT SINCE THAT

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:31.505
TIME.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.140
AT THE SAME TIME THE CASELOAD

01:38:33.207 --> 01:38:35.276
RATIOS HAVE RISEN.

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:38.279
I THINK AT LAST COUNT THE

01:38:38.345 --> 01:38:40.381
SERVICE SYSTEM WAS ABOUT SIX

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:40.948
HUNDRED SERVICE COORDINATOR

01:38:41.015 --> 01:38:42.116
SHORT --

01:38:42.182 --> 01:38:44.952
WHICH MAKES A DIFFERENCE

01:38:45.019 --> 01:38:45.252
[inaudible]

01:38:45.319 --> 01:38:47.187
IT IS.

01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:49.356
THOSE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS

01:38:49.423 --> 01:38:51.158
THAT ARE ON EACH CASE LOAD

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:53.427
REALLY DO PULL AWAY FROM THAT

01:38:53.494 --> 01:38:55.829
TIME THAT COULD BE SPENT. TO DO

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.665
MORE THOUGHTFUL [inaudible]

01:38:57.731 --> 01:38:59.166
PLANNING [inaudible]

01:38:59.233 --> 01:39:05.005
AND TIME SPENT IN MORE PROACTIVE

01:39:05.072 --> 01:39:10.944
ACTIVITY.

01:39:11.011 --> 01:39:11.979
SEEING THAT YOU KNOW YOU TALK

01:39:12.046 --> 01:39:14.481
ABOUT SIX HUNDRED OF SERVICE.

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:16.617
THE CUSTOMER SERVICES THEN.

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:17.818
BEEN --

01:39:17.885 --> 01:39:19.520
ACUTELY --

01:39:19.586 --> 01:39:23.257
COMPROMISED.

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:24.992
I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED BY THE

01:39:25.059 --> 01:39:26.460
RESILIENCY OF THE REGIONAL

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:28.462
CENTERS AND BY THE INCREDIBLE

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:29.697
COMMITMENT ON THE PART OF THE

01:39:29.763 --> 01:39:32.700
SERVICE COORDINATORS.

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:35.102
BUT PEOPLE WOULD DO BETTER.

01:39:35.169 --> 01:39:37.137
IF THEY HAD.

01:39:37.204 --> 01:39:39.306
LOWER CASELOAD RATIOS.

01:39:39.373 --> 01:39:40.341
THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND THE

01:39:40.407 --> 01:39:42.576
FACT THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE

01:39:42.643 --> 01:39:45.479
ADDITIONAL TIME FOR PLANNING.

01:39:45.546 --> 01:39:47.081
AND TALKING AND GETTING TO KNOW

01:39:47.147 --> 01:39:48.982
ONE ANOTHER.

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:51.185
AND REALLY UNDERSTANDING

01:39:51.251 --> 01:39:53.287
INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AS WELL

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:54.788
AS FINDING UNIQUE WAYS TO MAIM

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:57.358
EACH INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:39:59.326
HAS THE REGIONAL CENTERS TRACKED

01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:01.395
A RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES ONCE

01:40:01.462 --> 01:40:03.564
HAVE BEEN HIGHER WAS AVERAGE

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.065
LENGTH OF TIME THAT THEY'LL THEY

THEY STAY.

01:40:06.467 --> 01:40:09.069

01:40:09.136 --> 01:40:10.070
A PROBLEM WITH IT KEPING

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:25.619
APPRECIATE BECAUSE I THINK

01:40:25.686 --> 01:40:27.421
THAT'S ONE OF THE NUMBERS THAT

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:29.757
WE WOULD HELP US --

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:32.259
JUST BASED ON OF AS YOU TALK A

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.460
CAREER CHOICE --

01:40:33.527 --> 01:40:35.062
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.663
ABILITY TO WANT TO WORK IN THIS

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.265
COMPLEX WORLD.

WHO ARE TRAINED TO WORK IN THIS

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:40.667

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:45.472
A THEY HAVE A SKILL SET THAT IS

01:40:45.539 --> 01:40:47.674
VALUABLE TO THIS CONSUMER SO.

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.543
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT SO THAT

01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:51.211
WE CAN ADDRESS IT ALSO.

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:52.446

CENTERS FOR WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.353
AND AND UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE

01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.221
LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE GIVE

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:03.791

01:49:06.806 --> 01:49:08.909
SIX INTERNS WORKING IN VARIOUS

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.356
INTERNSHIP PROGRAM WHICH IS

01:49:23.423 --> 01:49:24.691

OF REHABILITATION.

01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:30.297
AND AND SO WE HOPE AND WE SEE

01:49:30.363 --> 01:49:32.799
THAT AS A REALLY GREAT PATHWAYS

01:49:32.866 --> 01:49:35.168
FOR PEOPLE TO OBTAIN.

01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:36.937
NOT ONLY EXPERIENCE THAT HELPS

01:49:37.003 --> 01:49:38.805
THEM BUT HOPEFULLY ALSO STATE

01:49:38.872 --> 01:49:40.840
EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS A HUGE GOAL

01:49:40.907 --> 01:49:42.242
FOR A LOT OF THE POPULATION THAT

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:43.610
WE WORK WITH THE CITY.

01:49:43.677 --> 01:49:45.145
STATE EMPLOYMENT AS KIND OF LIKE

01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:46.947
A DREAM JOB.

01:49:47.013 --> 01:49:48.481
AND IT'S BEEN --

01:49:48.548 --> 01:49:50.550
UP UNTIL NOW REALLY HARD TO GET.

01:49:50.617 --> 01:49:51.785
YOUR FOOT IN THE DOOR IF YOU

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.053
HAVE WELL FOR EVERYONE BUT

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:53.987
ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WITH

01:49:54.054 --> 01:49:55.555
DISABILITIES.

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.457
SO THAT'S A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM

01:49:57.524 --> 01:49:58.625
AND THAT'S A DIRECT RESULT OF

01:49:58.692 --> 01:50:03.897
LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

01:50:03.964 --> 01:50:06.399
AND SO WILL ALSO ASKED ME TO

01:50:06.466 --> 01:50:08.068
TALK ABOUT THE STAFFING SHORTAGE

01:50:08.134 --> 01:50:10.236
ON I HAVE AS WELL SAID I'VE

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:12.105
WORKED IN THE FIELD ON FOR

01:50:12.172 --> 01:50:13.106
FOURTEEN YEARS PRIMARILY AND

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.041
SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT.

01:50:15.108 --> 01:50:17.711
AND AND I SEE STAFFING SHORTAGE

01:50:17.777 --> 01:50:19.679
AS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS

01:50:19.746 --> 01:50:21.014
AND DEFINITELY THE BIGGEST

01:50:21.081 --> 01:50:22.949
BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT FOR PEOPLE

01:50:23.016 --> 01:50:24.050
WITH INTELLECTUAL AND

01:50:24.117 --> 01:50:26.086
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES.

01:50:26.152 --> 01:50:27.454
I AM CURRENTLY.

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.489
IN THE PROGRAMS THAT I OVERSEE

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:30.857
IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE --

01:50:30.924 --> 01:50:33.159
OVER FORTY PEOPLE ON A WAIT LIST

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:36.296
WHO WANT JOB SEEKING SUPPORT --

01:50:36.363 --> 01:50:39.265
AND WE'D JUST CANNOT HIRE STAFF

01:50:39.332 --> 01:50:41.067
TO SERVE THOSE PEOPLE.

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.536
SO THAT MEANS THAT THE WANT TO

01:50:43.603 --> 01:50:44.971
GET A JOB BUT THEY'RE WAITING

01:50:45.038 --> 01:50:46.373
FOR SOMETIMES MORE THAN SIX

01:50:46.439 --> 01:50:48.141
MONTHS BEFORE WE HAD STAFFING

01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:50.377
AVAILABLE TO WORK WITH THEM.

01:50:50.443 --> 01:50:52.846
AND THE STAFFING SHORTAGE.

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.914
STEMS FROM TWO THINGS AND THEY

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:56.182
ARE RELATED.

01:50:56.249 --> 01:50:58.385
AND ONE OF THEM IS THAT OUR

01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.153
REIMBURSEMENT RATES DON'T ALLOW

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:02.255
US TO PAY PEOPLE A LIVABLE

01:51:02.322 --> 01:51:03.957
PROFESSIONAL WAY EACH.

01:51:04.024 --> 01:51:05.859
BANDS AND THE OTHER ONE IS THAT

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:07.694
DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ARE

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:10.296
NOT SEEN AS PROFESSIONALS

01:51:10.363 --> 01:51:10.597
[inaudible]

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:12.499
THAT --

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.234
THEY'RE NOT EVEN LISTED ON THE

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.469

AS A CAREER CHOICE.

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:21.741
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOB

01:51:21.808 --> 01:51:22.776
DUTIES OF A CERTIFIED NURSING

01:51:22.842 --> 01:51:24.511
ASSISTANT.

01:51:24.577 --> 01:51:25.678
AND THEN YOU LEFT OUT THE JOB

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:26.479
DUTIES OF A DIRECT SUPPORT

01:51:26.546 --> 01:51:28.048
PROFESSIONAL.

01:51:28.114 --> 01:51:30.550
THEY MATCH UP LINE FOR LINE AND

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:31.651
THEN THE DUTIES OF A DIRECT

01:51:31.718 --> 01:51:34.054
SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL GO ON EVEN

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:36.322

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.571

01:51:51.638 --> 01:51:52.772
BETWEEN THOSE.

01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:55.241

02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:51.924
OTHER OPTIONS ARE USING WHAT'S

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:53.559
KNOWN AS HOTEL THERAPY.

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:55.194
WHICH PLACES AN INDIVIDUAL IN

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:57.463
CRISIS IN A HOTEL WITH TO THE

02:08:57.529 --> 02:08:58.730
ONE STAFFING AND TWENTY OF

02:08:58.797 --> 02:09:00.833
TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY.

02:09:00.899 --> 02:09:02.801
WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT

02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:05.003
ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET CAPACITY --

02:09:05.070 --> 02:09:06.505
IT BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE

02:09:06.572 --> 02:09:08.474
ADDITIONAL SAFETY NET COMMIT

02:09:08.540 --> 02:09:10.409
CAPACITY AT THE CURRENT --

02:09:10.476 --> 02:09:12.544
CAPACITY IS INSUFFICIENT TO MEET

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:13.612
THE NEED.

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:15.180
WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT

02:09:15.247 --> 02:09:17.082
INCREASED SAFETY NET FUNDING IS

02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:18.217
NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE

02:09:18.283 --> 02:09:19.451
DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL CRISIS

02:09:19.518 --> 02:09:20.419
CAPACITY.

02:09:20.486 --> 02:09:22.121
SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH

02:09:22.187 --> 02:09:23.322
SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL.

02:09:23.388 --> 02:09:26.191
CHALLENGES CAN BE SUPPORTED IN

02:09:26.258 --> 02:09:27.960
THEIR CURRENT LIVING ARRANGEMENT

02:09:28.026 --> 02:09:28.260
[inaudible]

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:30.596
WITH -- IN

02:09:30.662 --> 02:09:32.131
ORDER TO PIN UP PREVENT

02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:33.599

HEALTH FACILITIES.

02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:41.373
THUS WE SUGGEST WHAT BONDS NEED

02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:42.808
TO BE TARGETED FOR THE FOLLOWING

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:44.610
TYPES OF SERVICES.

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.578
MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES IN EACH

REGIONAL CENTER CATCHMENT AREA

02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:49.148
AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:09:49.214 --> 02:09:50.582
SERVICES THERE.

02:09:50.649 --> 02:09:51.650
THEY ARE NOW AVAILABLE BUT THEY

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:55.454
ARE VERY HARD TO ACCESS --

02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:57.389
AND IN EACH REGIONAL CENTER AREA.

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:59.258
COMPREHENSIVE INDIVIDUAL

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:00.926
ASSESSMENT PLANNING AND TAILORED

02:10:00.993 --> 02:10:01.994
SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS IN

CRISIS. TO PROVIDE A CONTINUITY

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:07.199
OF TREATMENT --

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.800
TREATMENT SUPPORTS INTENSIVE

02:10:08.867 --> 02:10:10.869
MONITORING.

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:13.071
CASE MANAGEMENT AND I THINK MISS

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:14.206
WAS LIKE TALK ABOUT THIS

02:10:14.273 --> 02:10:17.075
REDUCING CASE A SERVICE CASELOAD

02:10:17.142 --> 02:10:18.076

02:10:18.143 --> 02:10:19.545
POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS.

02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:21.013
DEVELOPMENT OF INTENSIVE OF

02:10:21.079 --> 02:10:22.714
WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PERSONS

02:10:22.781 --> 02:10:24.383
WITH CO OCCURRING DEVELOPMENTAL

02:10:24.449 --> 02:10:26.251
DISABILITIES AND MENTAL HEALTH.

02:10:26.318 --> 02:10:27.853
NEEDS THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:29.354
HAVE DUAL DIAGNOSES.

02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:30.622
THE YOU SERVICES WILL ALLOW

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:32.157
INDIVIDUALS TO SUCCESSFULLY

02:10:32.224 --> 02:10:34.293
PREVENT ADMISSION INTO HIGHLY

02:10:34.359 --> 02:10:35.694
RESTRICTIVE SETTINGS LIKE

02:10:35.761 --> 02:10:37.329
INSTITUTES OF MENTAL DISEASE WE

02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:39.031
CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT

02:10:39.097 --> 02:10:40.566
THE LACK OF LACK OF MOVEMENT

02:10:40.632 --> 02:10:42.234
FROM INDIVIDUALS.

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:43.235

STATUTORY TIMELINE OF A HUNDRED

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:48.840
AND EIGHTY DAYS.

02:10:48.907 --> 02:10:51.210
SO I'M TOO OFTEN OF REGIONAL

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:52.945
CENTERS DO NOT DEVELOP PLANS TO

02:10:53.011 --> 02:10:54.112
MOVE THESE INDIVIDUALS OUT OF

THAT SOME FOLKS GET IN IN ANY

THREE WEEKS IN THE HOSPITAL.

02:24:25.089 --> 02:24:26.124
BECAUSE ALAMEDA COUNTY AT THAT

02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:28.659

NOT DAN HOKA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:44.642
LOST CONFIDENCE IN CENTRAL

02:24:44.709 --> 02:24:47.645
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE SERVE.

02:24:47.712 --> 02:24:49.347
A APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED TWENTY

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:51.149
INDIVIDUALS IN ADULT DAY

02:24:51.215 --> 02:24:53.684
PROGRAMS AT ADULT RESIDENTIAL

02:24:53.751 --> 02:24:54.819
SUPPORTED LIVING IN THE

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:57.922
INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES ARM.

02:24:57.989 --> 02:24:59.657
I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT.

02:24:59.724 --> 02:25:01.292
WHILE THE RATE STUDY IS COMING

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:03.394
OUT THAT WE NEED TO ALSO EXAMINE

02:25:03.461 --> 02:25:08.066
IS THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE ARE ON

02:25:08.132 --> 02:25:09.367
THE VENDOR CODES.

02:25:09.434 --> 02:25:10.902
AND THE LIMITATIONS THAT IT

02:25:10.968 --> 02:25:13.538
PLACES ON VENDORS ARE IN THAT IN

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:14.572
THE SERVICES THAT THEY ACTUALLY

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.040
PROVIDE.

02:25:16.107 --> 02:25:17.809
SO AS WE MOVE TOWARD SELF

02:25:17.875 --> 02:25:19.510
DETERMINATION IN INDIVIDUALS ARE

02:25:19.577 --> 02:25:20.545
CHOOSING THE SERVICES THAT THEY

02:25:20.611 --> 02:25:22.814
WANT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:25:22.880 --> 02:25:25.149
NEED TO REMEMBER IS THAT VENDORS

02:25:25.216 --> 02:25:27.251
NOW NEED TO BECOME VERY FLEXIBLE.

02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:30.021
IN CUSTOMIZING THE SERVICES TO

02:25:30.088 --> 02:25:31.456
THE INDIVIDUAL SO IF YOU'RE

02:25:31.522 --> 02:25:33.224
SAYING THAT IF YOU SAY THAT

02:25:33.291 --> 02:25:34.659

AND SO FORTH BUT THE INDIVIDUAL

02:25:39.330 --> 02:25:40.832
WANTS TO ALSO DO OTHER THINGS

02:25:40.898 --> 02:25:42.500
THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS WELL THAT

02:25:42.567 --> 02:25:44.335
ARE NOT WITHIN THAT.

02:25:44.402 --> 02:25:45.403
WE NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE BAD

02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:47.138
SERVICE CUTS AND I AGREE WITH
