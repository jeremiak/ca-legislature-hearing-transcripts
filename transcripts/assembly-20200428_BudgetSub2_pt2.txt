IN CLOSURE IS AN EVERY WE KNOW THAT CHILD CARE IS AN ESSENTIAL CRITICAL SERVICE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND A BACKBONE OUR- ONE SUPPORTS WORKING. WHILE ALSO COMPANY HEALTHY CHILD DEVELOPMENT WE WANT TO THANK THE LOOKS. FOR GIVING US. TO ADDRESS ACTUAL. REQUIREMENTS IN THAT FISCAL YEAR WITH THE PASSING OF ONE SEVENTY. AS WELL AS SEVERAL THE GOVERNOR ACCEPT ORDERS. IN LIGHT OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY OUR TEAM HERE HE HAS THAT IN AS FAST AS HUMANLY. I'M SURE THAT THERE ARE. FIELD THE GUY THAT IT NEEDS AT. ALSO TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT AND I CAN'T HONORED FOR. IN YEARS. TO DATE WE'VE RELEASED IT MANAGED. WELL ATTENDS WITH SEVERAL MORE IN THE QUEUE. WE'VE ALSO DEVELOPED NUMEROUS FAQS AND HELD WEAPONS. AS WE DEVELOP THIS GUIDANCE WE PARTNER CLOSE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SIR. GOVERNOR AS WELL AS THE VI&lt;c.cyan&gt; BEING RELIGIOUS STAFF&lt;/c&gt; MEMBERS ARE CON PARTNERS AND THERE'S IN ABOUT THIS GUY IS TO PROVIDE TO RECKON. IS STABLE THIS OF THAT REAL EVEN CARE YEAH AND ELENA FOUND EASIER RECOVERY WE GET THAT POINT. THE IN SERVING OUR PARK SENATE QUESTIONS OF GOTTEN SO FAR. AROUND HOW DID WE DETERMINE ANY OF OUR NEED FOR THAT. AT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF DEMAND FOR CHILD CARE MIND ESSENTIAL WORKERS OUR TEAM ANALYZE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY CENSUS DATA. AN ESTIMATED ONE POINT SIX MILLION CHILDREN OR OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SAM X. OF A MAN ARE IN REQUIRE. WERE ALSO A FOR EMERGING CHILD CARE DUE TO THEIR PARENTS BEING SENT TO WORK. IF THAT'S THE MERGING THE HADN'T OCCURRED WE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY HAD MORE CHILDREN ABOUT 62% SIX MONTHS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND THIS DECREASE DEMAND IS A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT MEN WHO AREN'T FROM FAMILIES OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE SHELTERING AT HOME. THOSE CHILDREN THERE ARE ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO WORK IN THE HEALTH CARE PUBLIC HEALTH AND EMERGENCY SERVICES SECTOR AND WHOSE FAMILIES HAVE INCOMES BELOW 85% STATE MEDIAN INCOME. AS I ENTER UNDER SEVENTY THOUSAND FOR A FAMILY OF THREE. IN ADDITION TO MEDIAN INCOME OUT REQUIREMENTS. SEC ORDER AND FORTY SEVEN TWENTY ANOTHER ONE POINT SIX MILLION CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO DON'T MEET INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY CHILDCARE AFTER ALL OTHER PRIORITIES ARE. IT REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF OTHER PRIORITIES FIRST WE'VE ALSO QUESTIONS AROUND FROM THE AND- AROUND NONTRADITIONAL HOURS AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT NEED WOULD BE. WELL WE DO NOT HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN ESSENTIAL WORKERS ANY CARE VERY NON TRADITIONAL HOURS WE DO KNOW THAT THE PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT NEEDS ASSESSMENT. FOUND THAT. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TEN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE IT DIDN'T ANALYZE THAT NEEDED CARE DURING NONTRADITIONAL HOURS BASED. WORK SCHEDULE. SO AS WE MOVE INTO THE DEBATE AND JUST REMEMBER THAT A LOT OF YEAH AS HE TRIED OUR STATE AND THE AND FOR CHILD CARE. DEVELOPED ESTIMATES TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE MOST RECENT. ADDICTING WORKS IN IS BECAUSE WELL ABOVE THEY CAN BE NINETEEN. THIS OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE FOR AS ME CARE MAY HAVE CHANGED INDUSTRY OR MAY NO LONGER BE EMPLOYED. ADDITIONALLY THAT DOESN'T INDICATE WHETHER THOSE WORKING AN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES AND THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT THEIR ESSENTIAL FUNCTION WHILE WORKING FROM HOME. THE DATA ALSO DOES NOT INDICATE WHETHER THOSE WORKING AN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES AFTER FOR OTHER OPTIONS FOR CARE. AND WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE. AND HAVING OTHER SHELTER AT HOME WITH THEM AND HAVING THAT. HOWEVER EVEN WITH THESE CAP YES WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO CONTINUE TO NEED CARE. AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR SERVING ESSENTIAL WORKERS WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATED TO CREATE RATE THE ADDITIONAL ABILITY. TO SERVE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND TO AT RISK POPULATIONS. USING AN ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY WE ADDRESSED THE FIFTY MILLION FOR AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENTS THOUGHTS ACROSS THE STATE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS. LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE ADDRESS POP. AS WELL AS CHILDREN IN THESE. COUNTY ACROSS. ABOUT THE STATUS OF PAYMENT THEMSELVES WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE GONE DIRECT CONTRACTING PROCESS WITH OUR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM SO THAT THOSE PLANS ARE ON THEIR WAY TO NON CONTRACT ALREADY IN THEIR HANDS. IN ADDITION TO WHAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED WILL BE ADVANCING ALL OF THEM 33% OF THEIR FUNDING THAT WILL HAVE ADEQUATE CASH ON HAND FOR ANY ANTICIPATED. ROMANCE WE LOOK AT OUR GUIDANCE FOR CERTAIN ESSENTIAL WORKERS. GIVEN THE LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE PARENTS THAT SENT TO WORKERS OUR GUIDANCE ON THIS CLARIFIES THE PROVIDER SHOULD ONLY BE ENROLLING CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS RISK POPULATIONS IN CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AT THIS TIME. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE PRIORITY ORDER FOR THAT FAMILIES SELF CERTIFY THAT CHILDREN FALL INTO THESE CATEGORIES TO BE SERVED AND THE CHILDREN ELIGIBLE ARE ONLY THE GUY ONLY COVERS REACHING THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY. THEY DO NOT LEAVE THE TWELVE. I MEAN ARE. THIS ENTERPRISE TO CONTRACTORS THEIR FUNDS TO ALL CHILDREN EMERGING CHILD AS WELL AS CONTRACTORS USING THAT FIFTY MILLION AUGMENTATION THAT THEY JUST RECEIVED. SO AS WE LOOK AT TRACKING PLY IN THIS ACROSS THE STATE. I'M IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT PARENTS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL ARE ABLE TO FIND EMERGENCY CARE WE HAVE DIRECTED OUR LOW RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES ARE ARE IN OUR COLLECTED UP LIKE DATA ON WHETHER SUCH. A HOME BASED PROVIDERS ARE. WITH A BILL OF. ARE BUT WE TO OPEN A TECHNO ASSISTANCE ARE SOME. OR CLOSED AND WILL REMAIN CLOSED. THIS STATE IS WORKING ON CONNECTING ALL THE OUR INNER AGENCY DATABASES SOMETHING CALLED MY CHILD CARE PLAN. I DATABASE TOLD ABOUT BY THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCE AND REFERRAL NOW IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CD AND OTHER PARTNERS. ONCE THIS IS COMPLETE THAT ANIMAL. BUT THE STATE LEVEL FOR HELP MAKE POLICY DOES THAT. BRING MY- WE NEED NOT BECAUSE WHICH IS THAT THE CAL DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES HAS BEEN DOING EMPIRE WITH REST OF I'M WE LOOK AT STEP. AT WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY BETWEEN SIX AND APRIL EIGHTH FOR BOTH OUR EARLY MORNING HERE DIRECT CONTRACT THE FIGHTERS. THE TEAM MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHICH PROVIDERS ARE OPEN. THE 54% THAT RESPONDED WE HAD 70% WHO ARE OPEN AND PROVIDING CARE AS OF EARLY APRIL. ADDITIONAL 18% INDICATED THAT THEY PLAN TO OPEN. OR WELL. AFTER WE REALLY GUIDANCE ON AND ROLLING WORK. ASIAN WE'VE HEARD MANY MORE DIRECT CONTACT PROGRAMS ARE WILLING TO NOW OPEN UP SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION IN SERVING CHILDREN AND ESSENTIAL WORK. WE WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA TO MONITOR THIS AVERAGING XIN. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS FOR US ALL TO REALIZE AND THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS IS THE ISSUE OF STABILIZING PROVIDERS. ONE OF THE- IN TO STABILIZE THE CHILD OR SUPPLY AND ENSURE CHILD CARE PROVIDER SOLVENCY. IS TO ISSUE GUIDANCE IN THE PROVIDERS CAN STILL BE PAID EVEN IF THEY ARE. THIS ALSO STATES THAT CLOSE FOR BUYERS WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE FAMILIES WHILE THEIR PAY. AS THIS WORKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY. DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S COMING THROUGH OUR VOUCHER SYSTEM ARE DIRECT CONTRACTS SYSTEM IT DOES. CONTRACTS SYSTEM ACTUALLY HAD CHILDREN IN A PROGRAM INCLUDING A CENTER OR A FAMILY CHILDCARE HOME AS PART OF A NEW CHAPTER EDUCATION NETWORK. THE SECOND DOOR THE CHILDREN RECEIVE A VOUCHER FOR INTERNET PAYMENT CONTRACTOR AND CAN USE THAT VOUCHER TO CHOOSE THEM A PLACE OF THEIR SET I'M CHOOSING A CENTER OF HOME OR LICENSE EXEMPTS PROVIDER THREE OKAY GET. OUR CONTRACT IN DOWNTOWN PROVIDE ARE THAT ARE PART OF INFECTION MAY CONTINUE TO BE PAID FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR IF THEY'RE CLOSED. HE'S PROVIDERS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A PLAN TO ASK AND HOW THEY WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE FAMILIES BY THEIR CLOTHES. WHICH INCLUDED. AT PROVIDING ONLINE RESOURCES AND ACTIVITIES FOR THEIR CHILDREN AT HOME IN THE ENGAGEMENT EARLY LEARNING ACTIVITIES WE'VE HEARD OF VIRTUAL CIRCLE TANKS AND STORY TIMES. OUR PROVIDERS ARE DROPPING OFF BOOKS IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND DOING READ ALOUD WITH THE CHILDREN VIRTUALLY AS WELL AS SUPPORTING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS. CONTINUE WITH THEIR- CHILDREN- TEACHERS AND THEIR PEERS. AS WELL AS INCREASING THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. FOR ABOUT YOUR SIDE OF THE HOUSE IS CENTER IN FAMILY CHILDCARE LICENSE EXAM PROVIDERS WHO ARE RECEIVING A VOUCHER FROM MY FAMILY MAY CONTINUE TO BE PAID FOR UP TO THIRTY CALENDAR DAYS STARTING ON THE FIRST DAY THE PROVIDER CLOSED. THIS APPROACH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN OUR DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS AS ABOUT YOUR ACTUALLY FOLLOWS THE CHILD IN THE FAMILY IF THE PROVIDER CLOSES AND THE PROVIDE FAMILY DECIDES TO ATTEND A DIFFERENT PROVIDER. AND ABOUT YOUR FOLLOWS THEM TYPICALLY TO THE NEW PROVIDER. AS OLD AS FAMILIES ORIGINAL CHILDCARE PROVIDERS WERE CLOSING AND THESE NEED TO SWITCH TO SECONDARY PROVIDERS TO CONTINUE THEIR CARE. WE HAVE FOR THE DAYS OF DUAL PROVIDER PAYMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WAS DEVELOPED. PROVIDES DIRECT CONTRACTING IS DECIDING TO SHELTER IN PLACE NOT PROVIDER WILL STILL RECEIVE THE FUNDS TO HOLD THAT CHILD SPOT. THESE POLICIES STABILIZE THE CHILD CARE SUPPLY AND ENSURE THAT CHAPTR PROVIDERS CAN STAND BUSINESS AS WELL AS PAY THEIR STAFF UNTIL DURING AND AFTER THE RECOVERY. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITHQUALITY ACTIVITIES WE REALLY HAVE AT SOME OF OUR CCD AFTER CHILDCARE AND DEVELOPMENT FUND QUALITY INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PROGRAMS CAN BEST SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS. SAID THEY SHIFTED FROM IN PERSON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO VIRTUAL. TEAM VIRTUALLY HOLDING COMMITTEES OF PACKED THAT'S VIRTUALLY AND REALLY FOCUSING ON THINGS THAT JUST TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY PRACTICE. WE'VE SEEN A REMARKABLE INCREASE IN OUR CALIFORNIA EARLY CHILDHOOD ONLINE PLATFORM THAT WE HOSTED A DEPARTMENT. THAT WE TYPICALLY HAVE FIVE HUNDRED USERS PER MONTH SINCE MARCH FIRST WE HAD OVER TEN THOUSAND NEW USERS JONES JOINT SECO. WITH USERS REFLECTING OUR WORLD COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS OUR URBAN AND LA NOW BEING HOME TO AYE THIRD ALL SPEAK OF USERS. WE'VE SEEN SOME OF OUR INVESTMENTS SUCH AS QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA. ARE EACH TWELVE REALLY WRAP AROUND OUR PART COMES TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. ME AS WELL AS SUPPORTING STAFF TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL COST. WE SHARED WAS A MEMBER CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE THE ABILITY THAT THEY COULD USE SOME OF THEIR FINDS TO PURCHASE SUPPLIES STAR ARE IN OUR AGENCIES AS WELL AS LOOKED HEALTHCARE ANY COUNCILS. AT MOVING FORWARD THE OTHER THING THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IS THE FIFTY MILLION YOU'VE PROVIDED TO SUPPORT THE CLEANING SUPPLIES FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. THESE ALLEGATIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING MADE TO OUR RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES IT WILL THEN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING THESE FUNDS TO BOTH LICENSED AND LICENSE EXEMPT PROVIDERS. IN THEIR SERVICE AREAS. BOTH PROVIDERS ARE SERVING SUBSIDIZE CHILDREN AS WELL AS PRIVATE PAY CHILDREN CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS. NUMBER FINALIZING THE GUIDANCE FOR OUR NORTH HONEST THE ALLOCATIONS FOR AIR ALREADY OVER THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THEIR WAY TO. SHORTLY HE'S FINE COMBINED WITH THE FOUR MILLION THAT FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY PROVIDED TO THE FIELD AS WELL AS OUR REPURPOSE FUNDS FROM A QUALITY PROJECTS. IN HELP OUR PROVIDERS ACCESS ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES AND RESOURCES THAT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO OPEN. AND RE OPEN AND PROVIDE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE. AT THE LAST THING THAT I THINK I WILL COVER IS AS WE ADDRESS THINGS IS LOOKING AT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. AND WE JUST READ THE DEPARTMENT RELEASED AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON MONDAY THAT OUR AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY ARE ACES AS WELL AS OUR TWENTY FIRST AT EIGHT. AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY ASKED THAT ARE GOING STANDING THERE GRANT SAID THAT DURING THE SUMMER THEY CAN REALLY GIVE IT TO GO MORE DEEPLY ON THE SUMMER LEARNING LOSS. I YOU KNOW ARE AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMS. THANKS THEIR STAFF COME FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THEY PROVIDE A GREAT DEAL OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT AS WELL AS DEEP THIRTEEN THE HELP IS NOT THAT I THAT HAPPENS RIGHT COMMUNITIES. SPRING CLOSING AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS CHALLENGING TIME WE WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO SURE STABILIZATION FOR FAMILIES PROVIDERS WHILE ADDRESSING THE URGENT NEED THAT ESSENTIAL WORKERS. REACHED REALLY BELIEVE THAT THE STEPS WE'RE TAKING TODAY ARE WORKING TO SAFEGUARD CALIFORNIA'S CHILD CARE TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. THAT THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT REALLY AN IMPACT ALL OF THIS AS WELL THE RESEARCH SPANNING THE ENTIRE ECONOMIC SITE WELL UNDERSCORES THE INVESTMENT IN CHILDCARE ROSE THE ECONOMY IMPROVES JOB QUALITY THAT'S CHILDREN UP TO EAT WILL CONTINUE TO RELEASE A REVISED GUIDANCE AS THE SITUATION CHANGES. I THINK ALL OF YOUR SEAT AND IT SEEMS TO US DAILY AND BE AS RESPONSIVE AS POP SO BOBBY NEAT DURING THIS EMERGENCY. THANKS FOR RECOGNIZE. IN THIS. YOU AND I. ANSWER ANY QUESTION YOU MIGHT HEAR. OKAY THANK YOU WILL SEE COME BACK TO YOU BIT LATE NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR MICHAEL NICK WE THE CHILD CARE A LOT OF LOS ANGELES. MICHAEL THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE CHILD CARE ALLIANCE OF LOS ANGELES- I'M MICHAEL ON THAT GUY AND THE BOARD PRESIDENT- OF THE ALLIANCE THIS YEAR. AND ALSO THE PRESIDENCY OF THE CHALK RESOURCE CENTER WHICH OPERATES IN NORTHERN LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND ALMOST ALL OF US AND OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. I'M GONNA TALK BOUT- IN PARTICULAR WHAT THE ARE NOT OURS THE AP RESPONSE HAS BEEN IN LA. BUT I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE ARCHER MARSHALL THE MARKET LARGER. RESPONSE WORKING WITH RAY. THE SAME CAL EIGHT AND PRIVATE. THAT HAVE BEEN FOR ALMOST TWO MONTHS TO BRING A COUNTY WIDE CHILD PLAN CONTROL. WE'VE SEEN ON THE- WE'VE NEED THE REASON RESOURCES TO. RATING IN. YOU KNOW I COUNTY WE HAVE EIGHT OUR HOURS ADMINISTERING CHILDCARE SUBSIDIES INCLUDING STAGE ONE STAGE TWO STAGE THREE THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM IN AN ADDITIONAL THREE AGENCIES THAT ARE NOT OURS BUT ALL ADMINISTER ALL THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. TERROR AGENCIES BELONG ALLIANCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY YEARS AGO TO POOL RESOURCES PROVIDING CONSISTENCY ACROSS PROGRAMS. IN CREATING A SINGLE ENTRY POINT FOR THE COUNTY AND THE STATE. MANY YEARS AGO I IT'S CREATED A WEBSITE AND TOLL FREE NUMBERS SO THAT FAMILIES COULD FIND THEIR LOCAL LEARN ARE. IN COULD SEAMLESSLY MOVED TO THEIR LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDER. LOCAL ARE NOT COUNSELOR CAN PROVIDE THEM WITH REFERRALS DIRECT THEM TO SIGN UP FOR THE AUTUMN OF PAYMENT PROGRAM QUIRK VICE THEM ON HOW TO ACCESS THE TEN OF FUNDED CHILDCARE PROGRAMS. ANDERSON SO SELF SERVICE THROUGH OUR WEBSITES. WHEN THE PANDEMIC TO HAVE THEM IT STRUCK LA COUNTY. CHILD CARE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS BECAME PACKED PARAMOUNT. ALL EIGHT GARNER'S HAD BEEN CONTACTING EVERY LICENSE PROVIDER TO DETERMINE AVAILABILITY TO CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEDICAL STAFF IN PARTICULAR FOR THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS. AS OF FRIDAY APRIL TWENTY FOU. 56% OF OUR LICENSE FAMILY PROVIDERS WERE OPEN. 22% OF OUR SAMPLE CENTERS ARE OPEN. ONLY 10% OF OUR S. P. P. AND C. C. T. ARE CONTRACTED SITES WERE OPEN. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NUMBER OF CARE PROVIDERS WHO WILL BE ABLE TO RETURN OF ONE FIFTY THIS CRAP THIS IS OF. WE ADDED ENHANCED ROSE TO OUR ARMED SERVICE CAN. WRITE ON APRIL TENTH. YEAH CONTACTS US AND WE ARE ABLE TO CONTACT PROVIDERS THAT WE KNOW ARE OPEN TO SECURE A SPOT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING. PUSH THIS IT'S JUST PART OF WHAT WE CAN OFFER THROUGH OUR ON OUR COUNTRY. TWO WEEKS AGO MADE A PRESENTATION TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. WE HAD MORE THAN FIFTY HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVES ON THE CALL. SINCE THEN WE'VE RECEIVED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE CALLS FOR MEDICAL WORKERS. AND HAVE RECEIVED AND HAVE COMPLETED FIFTY FIVE ENHANCE REFERRALS RIVERSIDE FOR STAFF ACROSS THE COUNTY IS LEE IS HONEST THE HOSPITAL HR DEPARTMENTS AND EXPECT THE NUMBER OF ENHANCE REFERRALS TO CONTINUE TO RISE. BUT THEIR PRESENTATION TO THE PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITY ON THE NEED FOR SHORT TERM SUPPORT. AND HAD MORE THAN FIFTY PEOPLE ON THE CALL. WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONTRIBUTION SINCE THEN BUT NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO MAKE A DENT IN THE DEMAND FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE. WITH DONATIONS DIAPERS CLEANING SUPPLIES AND MASKS AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OUR PORTION OF THE FIFTY MILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED BY THE STATE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE ALSO HAVE TO CHOP TO STORE WE DO GET THE SUPPLIES PROVIDERS ARE ALSO COMPLAINING TO US. THAT THE STORES THAT ARE OPEN WILL NOT LET THEM SHOP DURING OUR SET ASIDE FOR THE WORKERS. CHILD CARE PROVIDERS ARE AS ESSENTIAL AS MEDICAL WORKERS IN THIS PANDEMIC AND SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AND WE WOULD ASK THE GOVERNOR TO ACTUALLY MENTION THIS IN ONE OF HIS BRIEFINGS. CITY ABOUT A IS DEVELOP EMERGENCY CENTERS AT SOME OF THE RECKONED PARK SITES USING EMERGENCY WORKERS AS CARE GIVERS FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. THEY ARE OBSERVING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES. SOME HOSPITALS HAVE CREATED POP UP SITE STAFFED BY VOLUNTEERS BUT WITH FOUR THOUSAND SPACES AVAILABLE IN LICENSE FACILITIES WE RECOMMEND USING CARE GIVES EXPERIENCE WITH GROUPS OF CHILDREN. WE ALSO NOTE MANY ESSENTIAL WORKERS NEED CARE FOR TWELVE HOUR DAYS AND WILL CHOOSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS TO PROVIDE CARE CLOSE TO HOME. WHEN CHALLENGE THAT WE HAD IS WAITING FOR THE FUNDING FOR THOSE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE HAD A NEED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. WE KNEW THAT THE FEDERAL STIMULUS CARES THAT ALLOCATED FUNDING FOR CHILD CARE FOR CENTRAL WORKERS BUT IT TOOK THE US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND HUMAN SERVICES OFFICE OF CHILD CARE SEVERAL WEEKS TO PROVIDE ALLOCATION AMOUNTS. AND GUIDANCE TO THE STATE. AND WE'VE SEEN YET TO SEE ONE DOLLAR HIT THE STREETS SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THEY'RE WORKING ON. WE ALSO KNEW THAT THE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED FOR CHILD CARE THREE BEACH ONE SEVENTEEN BUT DID NOT FIND OUT HOW THAT MANY WOULD BE ALLOCATED UNTIL FRIDAY APRIL SEVENTEENTH. FOR JUST C. C. R. C. MY AGENCY WHICH SERVES BOTH THE NORTHERN END OF LA COUNTY IN ALMOST ALL OF SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. 75% OF PARENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES THROUGH THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ARE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL WORKERS. IN SURVEYING ARE TWENTY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED PERSON WAITLIST. 66% ARE AN ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN 41% ARE IN MEDICARE RIGHT MEDICALLY RELATED SERVICES. WE'VE ALSO WITH OTHER. AND ONLY 72% OF THEIR WAITING LIST ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY 73% OR ESSENTIAL WORK. FOR MY AGENCY IF EVERY MEDICAL WORKERS CHILD WOULD RECEIVE CHILD CARE. WE WOULD HAVE TO SERVE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN. AT A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH WE WOULD NEED ALMOST SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH TO FILL THE NEED. SO WE RECEIVE SIX MILLION DOLLARS SHADE UNDER THAT WHICH WOULD FOR PHIL 18% OF THE NEED OF MEDICAL WORKERS. SO IF EVEN ONLY ONE THIRD OF THE CHILDREN NEEDED CARE WE WOULD NEED ABOUT FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. ON THURSDAY APRIL TWENTY THIRD WE STARTED INFORMING PARENTS THAT WE COULD NOW START ROLLING ESSENTIAL WORKERS INTO THE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM. IN JUST THE FIRST FEW DAYS MY ONE AGENCY RECEIVED NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE APPLICATIONS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY IN ANOTHER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. THE DEMAND FOR CHILD CARE SUPPORT WELL THAT'S DISAPPEAR IN THE NEW FISCAL YEAR. THE SCHOOLS CLOSED UNTIL. AB JULY MAYBE AUGUST MAYBE SEPTEMBER MAYBE LONGER. SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN MAINTAIN FULL TIME CARE NOT JUST AFTER SCHOOL RANCHES DEBATING THAT PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND EVEN SHE QUE PROGRAM SENSIBLE CAMPUSES MIGHT BE CLOSED BECAUSE OF THE ADDED DEMAND. THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEMAND- WE'RE HEARING FROM SUMMER CAMPS THAT WERE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES THAT THEY WILL BE CLOSE THE SUMMER THAT ALSO ADDS TO THE DEMAND. THERE MAY BE SOME SHORT TERM SAVING. FOR A P. PROGRAMS BUT NOT ENOUGH TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF JUST THE MEDICAL WORKERS. THE ASSUMPTION THAT PARENTS HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS AND CAN STAY HOME WITH THEIR CHILDREN HAS HAD VERY LITTLE IMPACT ON THE DEMAND THAT WE'RE SEEING. FOR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS. REALLY PROVIDING THE SUPPORT TO THE ON HERALD UNHERALDED MEDICAL WORKERS WHO CLEAN THE HOSPITALS THE FOR THE BOTTOM AS THE RECEPTIONIST NURSES ASSISTANCE THE TECHNICIANS. ALL OF THE LOW WAGE EARNERS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD WERE PRIMARILY WOMEN OF COLOR. JUST TO NAME SUPPORT JUST TO MAINTAIN SUPPORT FOR ESSENTIAL MEDICAL WORKERS AT THE CURRENT FUNDING LEVEL OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE WOUD NEED THREE MILLION DOLLARS STATE WIDE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. THIS IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A STATE WAS ALLOCATED THROUGH THE CARE CENTER. HOWEVER IT DOESN'T COME CLOSE TO THE NEED OF ALL THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. FINALLY I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF LICENSED CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WHO REMAIN OPEN DURING THIS CRISIS AND STRUGGLE TO REMAIN SAFE. WHILE PROVIDING SERVICE TO THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. AND I WANT YOU GUYS ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE WHO REMAINED OPEN. UP VIRTUALLY THANK. RALPH IS FIVE DAYS AFTER. FOR NOTRE. IS DUE TO THE CA. ADAPTABILITY AND CAN DO SPIRIT TO SUPPORTER PROVIDERS. ARE ESSENTIAL WORKING PARENTS CALIFORNIANS CHILDREN. YOU AND I REMAIN ON THE LINE. OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WILL GO TO CATHERINE COINS WITH THE PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. HI I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF GALLAGHER BILLION WHEN HE GOT FASTER COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE SOME OF OUR EXPERIENCES WITH EMERGENCY CHILDCARE PLASTER COUNTY I BELIEVE THAT OUR EXPERIENCES ARE SIMILAR TO MANY COUNTIES. THE STATE. YOUR TAKES PLACE THE MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM OF FAMILY FUNDED AND PUBLICLY FUNDED CHILDCARE. INTERCONNECTED INTERDEPENDENT WHEN ONE PART OF THE SYSTEM IS IMPACTED ALL PARTS OF THE SYSTEM ARE IMPACTED. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF CHILDCARE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ALL PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY. OFFICES OF EDUCATION FAMILY CHILDCARE AND INFORMAL CAREGIVERS SUCH AS FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. OFTEN PROGRAMS MUST MIX TUITION PRIVATE FUNDING WAS I THINK I SPENDING TO MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS. ENOUGH MONEY. A VIABLE. IN NINETEEN DEVASTATE OUR CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AFTER COUNTY ORIGINALLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS CLOSED. MANY OF OUR CURRENT ESSENTIAL WORKERS LOST THEIR FULL THE CHILD CARE THE REASONS VARIED THOSE DESIGNATED NONESSENTIAL WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BRING THEIR CHILDREN TO CARE OVER LAID OFF AND HAD TO STOP PAYINGFOR CARE. MANY PROGRAMS HAD TO CLOSE THE LACK OF ATTENDANCE MEANING LACK OF INCOME SOME CLOSED BECAUSE THEY WERE SCARED OR HAD PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE OR WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS LIVING IN THEIR HOME. AS MUCH AS CHILD CARE. ARE DEVOTED TO THE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THE CHILD CARE WORKFORCE IS NOT REIMBURSED ENOUGH TO RISK THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVESAND THEIR FAMILIES. ESPECIALLY WITH NO ACCESS TO SANITIZING SUPPLIES GLOVES WHITE. FACE COVERINGS ENHANCE ENERGIZER. MANY OF OUR CLOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY OPERATING FOR DECADES AND I WORRY THAT MANY WILL NOT WEATHER THE FINANCIAL STORM. AND BE ABLE TO RE OPEN. MY OWN PROGRAM IS AN ALLEY ON A SCHOOL CAMPUS. WHEN THE SCHOOLS CLOSED WE HAD TO. AS WE HAVE NO ACCESS TO OUR CLASSROOMS JANITORIAL SERVICE. SCHOOL I'M NOT YES. RECALL THE NINETEEN HAVE LONG WAITING LISTS FOR T&lt;c.cyan&gt; CARE.&lt;/c&gt; MANY OF OUR CURRENTLY ENROLLED SUBSIDIZE FAMILIES AS DOCTOR ONLY WAS REFERRING TO ARE NOW DESIGNATED AS ESSENTIAL. THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN ESSENTIAL. EMERGENCY CHILDCARE VOUCHER PROGRAM HAS BEEN A LIFELINE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND FOR OUR PROVIDERS SINCE THE EMERGENCY CHILD CARE ABOUT YOUR PROGRAM WE HAD A HAD A 25% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THAT WERE ABLE TO RE OPEN RANG US UP TO FIFTY PERCENT. WE ALL RESOURCE CENTER FOR ALL HE'S IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE READY WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHILD CARE VACANCIES AND IN LESS THAN EIGHT. ON ME IT HUNDRED SIXTY CHILDREN OF WORKERS. I IMAGINE NEED AND- MANY OF THESE FAMILIES THAT WE WORK JUST. THE CURRENT INCOME GUIDELINES TO QUALIFY FOR STATES I THINK I SCARE SO IT REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE HAVE INCOME GUIDELINES WAIT. WELL SOME OF THE CHILDREN OF SCHOOL AGE MANY OF THE CHILDREN ARE BELOW THE AGE OF FIVE. SUGGESTING THAT THERE WAS A TWO MINUTE HEALTHCARE FIRST THE WORK. JUST A THE STATE INCOME. ECHO BUT NINETEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE THEIR GUIDANCE AND PROMISE AND HOPE OF FINDING REALLY GOT US THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME. BUT LOOKING AHEAD RE OPENING SLOWLY IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND FOR WHAT IS WITH NOT WAS NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL. I'LL COMMENT QUICKLY ON THREE THINGS FIRST OF ALL WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FACILITIES SUPPLIES. WE WILL NEED FUNDING TO MAKE OUR SPACES AVAILABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN PHYSICALLY DISTANT AS THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT IN HIS- UPDATE TODAY. WE DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED MORE CLASSROOMS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACES AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THE K. TWELVE WORLD WILL NEED OUR SPACES SO THAT THEY CAN PHYSICALLY DISTANT. WHAT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACES IF WE DON'T FULLY ENGAGE IN SUPPORT THE ENTIRE MIX DELIVERY AND THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE NEED ZIP TIES AS THE LCD AND DOCTOR ONLY REFER TO. BECAUSE THAT WILL HELP SOME. PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO OPEN. SECOND OF ALL I HAVE TO POINT OUT IS A COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL READINESS STILL MATTERS. AND IT SEEMS THE CONVERSATION ABOUT HIGH QUALITY CARE. SCHOOL READING THIS AND EARLY LEARNING ARE NOT. DISCUSSED AS MUCH CHILD CARE. I HAVE TO POINT OUT A HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE INCLUDES EARLY LEARNING AND FULL DAY EARLY LEARNING INCLUDES CHILD CARE. WE HEARD EXPERTS EARLIER TODAY TALKING. TWELVE LEARNING ONCE BUT SCHOOL READINESS IN LEARNING READINESS FOR YOUNGEST CHILDREN MATTERS JUST AS MUCH AS K. TWELVE EDUCATION WE'RE AGAIN GRATEFUL THE LCD THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BE FOUND ITS REMAIN SERVING. CHILDREN ACROSS OUR PROGRAMS. ARE ZOOMING AND BLOOMING I CANNOT TELL YOU THEY LOVE HAVING THAT INTERACTION AND ALSO WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO OUR FAMILIES. REFERRING TO FOOD BANKS AND HELPING THEM DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME IS MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST INCOME. IN THE THIRD YES I THINK ABOUT OUR FINANCES. YOU KNOW THE CENTRAL WORKERS WHEN THE CHILD CARE PAST JUNE THIRTIETH. WE WORRY ABOUT THE CHILDREN WHO WERE JUST SETTLING INTO CARE AND BONDING IN LEARNING WITH THEIR CARE GIVERS. AND WE WORRY FOR FAMILIES THIS IS THE ONLY CHILD CARE IS KOBE NINETEEN IS NOT GOING AWAY. WE WORRY ABOUT THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE JUST OVER THE INCOME GUIDELINES IT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBSIDIZED CARE. WE ALSO NEED CONTINUED FIRST THIS CALL FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE CONTRACTORS WHO ARE ABLE TO SHIP FINE. TUMOR CHILDCARE VOUCHER. THOSE OF US WHO ARE FULL DAY PROGRAMS NO WITH PHYSICAL DISTANCE. I NEVER FIRST TO WE CAN FULLY OR NOT. AND STAFF WHICH COULD LEAD TO LAYOFFS. WE HOPE THAT STATE FUNDED CONTRACTORS TO HELP OUR LIST FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR AND HAVE OUR PORTIONS MINTS. BASED ON EXPENSES UP TO A MAXIMUM REIMBURSABLE AMOUNTS RATHER THAN ONLY ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. A TEACHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM DOES NOT NEED TO WORRY ABOUT HIS OR HER JOB. A TEACHER OF A FOUR YEAR OLD IN THE STATE RESULT PROGRAM SHOULD HAVE THAT SAME PEACE OF MIND. IT IS OUR HONOR TO ENROLL IN HERE FOR CHILDREN OF THOSE EMERGENCY SERVICES HEALTHCARE GROCERY WORKERS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHERS% DESIGNATED ASSISTANCE ALL. THE FAMILY'S GRATITUDE HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING AND THE VERB MERGES THE VOUCHER PROGRAM IS HELPING TO KEEP AT LEAST SOME. OF OUR CLASSROOMS COUNTY CHILD CARE WORKFORCE EMPLOYED. WE KNOW THAT REVENUES ARE DOWN A CHILD CARE IS VITAL TO THE ECONOMIC. ENGINE OF THE STATE PLEASE ENTER. THINK CHILDCARE FOR ESSENTIAL WORK. CONTINUE NOW THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDS TO MAKE OUR SPACES SAFE AND HEALTHY AND TO CARE FOR THE WORK FORCE IT IS WORKING SO HARD EVERY DAY HEARING FOR THESE CHILDREN. WITH LOWERED STUDENTS NEW REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THE LEAST. CAN SEE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT CAN. RENALDO SANDERS NEXT FROM THE CHILD CARE PROVIDERS UNITED THE PROJECT AS HE A UT TO UT W. AND APPS ME.

CURRENTLY MY DAYCARE- IS FILLED WITH CHILDREN OF THIS SHOW WORKERS RANGING FROM THE NURSES AND GROCERY WORKERS TO BUS DRIVERS AND TAX PREPARERS.

STRESS THAT THEY MIGHT BE INFECTED STRESS THAT THEY MEAN BAKER CHILDREN ARE THEIR OR THEIR BABIES THE BABIES ARE FILLING STRESSES ALSO. SO I WE CHANGED OUR DAILY TEACHING OR LEARNING ACTIVITIES TO WILL TEAMS- WHO SHOULD BE MORE ENGAGING AND FUN USING SOCIAL.

IT'S REALLY SOMETIMES THEM POSSIBLE WITH CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE DONE THE BEST WE CAN BY CHANGING FROM PHYSICAL HUGGING SO CROSSING OUR ARMS AND FIVE OR FIVE. DUCKS INCIDENT CIRCLE TIME MOBILE PHONES ARE SITTING CLOSE TO EACH OTHER ACROSS OUR HANDS AND BONTA CRACKPOT. AS WELL SOCIAL DISTANCING YES OUT. HUNTSMAN SMOOCHES THROUGHOUT% THE DAY ELBOW BOMBS ARE JUST HE PLUS ALSO IT IS SOMETIMES HARD BECAUSE I DON'T. IF THEY WANT TO COME OVER SO THEY HAVE YOUR LEGS. ARE WITH THE CORPORATE- MANY THINGS THAT ARE WORKING FOR US AND WE'RE JUST SO HAPPY AND PROUD OF WHAT OUR BABIES ARE AND FAMILIES ARE JUST VERY VERY SPECIAL. OUR AND I FEEL PROUD TO BE DOING MY PART. THAT WE'RE DOING OUR PART TO HELP US GET THROUGH THIS TOUGH CRISES. BUT I WOULD BE LYING IF I WAS TO SAY THAT I'M NOT SARED I'M SCARED FOR MYSELF AS WELL AS MY FAMILY THAT WE MIGHT BE IN. THAT ANYTIME BUT I ALSO WANT THE FAMILIES THAT ARE IN OUR CARE APPEARANCE MY SOCIAL ESSENTIAL WORKERS CHANNEL BUT WHEN THEY LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN WITH US IT'S STILL THERE ARE STILL GOING TO. BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE SAME LOVE AND CARE. THEY'RE HEALTHY MALES ALSO DALY OF. AGE AND DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES BY FAMILY DAYCARE HOMES WE JUST DON'T SIT THERE AND WATCH TELEVISION WE ENGAGE OUR CHILDREN. AND THIS IS NOT NAPA WHICH MADE. FOR BUT- ROUTE TO BE A PART OF THAT AND THAT. IS OUR ARE. AS BUT WE ALWAYS SET. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REASON ACTS AND THAT THIS NEEDS TO TAKE I BELIEVE THE STATE AS WELL AS MY OUR CALL HURT SCHOOL WHO ARE HEALTH PROVIDERS LIKE ME CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS FIFTY MILLION INVESTMENT JOINT SHORE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS GET ACCESS TO CLEANING SUPPLIES MPP. I KEEPING OUR CHILD CARE'S SABOTAGE IS CRUCIAL I WANT TO STRESS. THE URGENCY AND GETTING THOSE SUPPLIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THANKS GETTING THEM. AT OUR HOUSE OUR LOCAL STORES ONLINE HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE. IN MY DAY CARE CENTER TIGHTENING IS CRUCIAL TO ME BEING ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN. I KNOW PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE HAVE CLOSED BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO REACH THE- DISINFECTANT CLEANER SCORE MASS WORK WHAT. SUDDENLY I WANT TO SHOW APPRECIATION FOR THE GOVERNOR'S FIFTY MILLION INVESTMENT IN CHILDCARE. FOR ITS SENSUAL WORKERS THIS IS A GREAT START BUT IT ONLY OPENS UP TWENTY THOUSAND SLOT. FOR TWO MONTHS NOT NEARLY WHAT ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS ME THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE ON WITH THEIR LIFE SAVINGS OR- THIRD I CALL CALIFORNIA TO ESTABLISH AND- EIGHT WORKFORCE RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT. PROGRAM ECP. SECTORS WE KNOW FROM PAST RECESSIONS BACK WHEN WE WHEN CHILDCARE PROVIDER STRUGGLE AND CLOSE THE DOORS DâN YEAH FIND LACKS THE BLOW JOB HERE QUALITY FLEXIBLE QUALITY JOB HERE. WE CAN'T FIND THAT BE AND THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED AS WE ARE- SENTRY AND STATE GAINES RECOVERY MOMENTOUS. BURKE I- SUPPORTING CHILDCARE PROVIDERS HEARING FOR THE CHILDREN OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS NAME THE PROVIDERS WILL BE ABLE TO. ALL THE ACT IS THAT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ALL. WHEN SCHOOLS RE OPENED THE ECONOMY RECOVERS THERE IS HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED IT DOCUMENTED THE OPERATING A CHILD HERE IN THE COLD AT NINETEEN AND FIREMEN WERE RAISES MORE THAN PARENTS AND THEY MAKE. THE TUITION. BOB TURNER DID PAYMENT PROGRAMS WE'VE WE'VE HEARD FROM. PARENTS AS WELL AS OTHER PROVIDERS THAT ARE TARGETED PAYMENT PROGRAMS. ARE GIVING VOUCHERS AND TRYING TO REMOVE VOUCHERS FROM PARENTS WHO ARE HOME BUT- NOT ESSENTIAL WORKERS% I HOPE THAT ISN'T TRUE IT HASN'T I HAVEN'T HEARD A YEAR PERSONALLY BUT OTHERS HALF. THIS IS OPPOSITE FROM THE GUIDANCE OF THE STATE HAS PROVIDED IT UNDERMINES FAMILIES NEEDED ACCESS TO CHILDCARE SUPPORT NOW AND- ONCE SHOP AROUND PLACED RESTRICTIONS ARE LEFT IT. IT CREATES GREAT UNCERTAINTY. FOR PROVIDERS IN THE TERMS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CRY AND WHAT THEIR INCOME WILL BE. THIS NEEDS TO BE CLARIFIED THE MEDIA LAKE IN ORDER TO GIVE US ALL PEACE OF MIND. FINALLY WE MUST WE MUST WE MUST USE THIS CRISIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO START OVER AND DO THINGS RIGHT WE MUST HOLD CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE. WHO ARE. FROM THE PROVISIONS OF SHOP HERE IN ORDER TO AVOID CUTS AND EXPAND CHILDCARE FUNDING AS PART OF THE EFFORT. TO REBUILD THE ECONOMY POST PANDEMIC WE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT CORPORATIONS THAT BENEFIT FROM PUBLIC FROM PUBLIC PROVISIONS OF JOB HERE IN REQUIRED THEM TO JOIN US AND SHOULDERING THE COST. I THANK YOU SO VERY VERY MUCH. AND I APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH RUN ALL THE FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE FOR. IT'S LIKE ON THE GROUND AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR THIRTY TWO YEARS PLUS IN SOUTH LA COUNTY. AND I THINK THAT WAS HELPFUL FOR US TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE FOR- PAY AT FAMILY DAYCARE PROVIDER. THAT CENTER BASE THAT LEADER WITH THE- CHILDREN'S ALLIANCE THERE WITH MR ALL NECK AS WELL AS FROM THE STATE I HAVE A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS I KNOW SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES TO AS WELL- I'LL START OFF. AT THE OUTSET IT AND- YOU KNOW IT IS THIS MR OWN ACT HI I TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THIS. HEADLINE IN- THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE BUT- YOU KNOW THERE'S FEAR THAT AFTER. CORONAVIRUS OUR CENTERS IN PROVIDERS WILL GO AWAY AND NEVER COME BACK SO- THE QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES IS NOT JUST HOW DO WE GROW. EASY TO MAKE SURE IT'S YOU KNOW UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE CALIFORNIA BUT HOW DO WE KEEP THE ONES THAT THE PROGRAMS WE HAVE. OPEN SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO RE OPEN OUR CENTERS. AND INTO MORE POORLY TODAY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. THEIR FINANCIAL SOLVENCY. SIR THIS ISN'T- ANY ISSUES THAT. ALL OF A SUDDEN OCCURRED BECAUSE O THE PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN LOSING CHILD CARE FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. BECAUSE THE COSTS. OF PROVIDING THE CARE AND- HAVE NOT KEPT UP. WITH WHAT THEY CAN RECEIVE EITHER PAYMENTS FROM US OR PAYMENTS FROM FAMILIES. AND IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE ENDS MEET- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OCCURS TO ME IS THAT WE PAY BASED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE IN IN OUR ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAMS INTERCEPT PROGRAMS. IN YET THAT ARE WE THE MARKET IT IS A SURVEY THAT'S DONE TWO YEARS PRIOR TO WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THIS YEAR SO. YOU'RE ALWAYS BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL AND THEN YOU GET APPROVED IMAGE OF THE MARKET YOU DON'T GET ALL OF. IT RATES. IF I A IT HARD A LOT OF. THAT ARE WILLING TO TAKE A- AND IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING REIMBURSED FOR THEIR ACTUAL COSTS SO THERE WAS A COST OF LIVING PIECE BUILT INTO THE ARM ARE THAT WOULD BRING IT UP TO CURRENT. AND BY THE WAY IT DOESN'T BE KEPT UP AND WHAT GETS BUDGET EVERY YEAR TO IT SEEMS SOME YEARS WE GET IT CURRENT. MEANING TWO YEARS LATE FOR SOME YEARS IT'S EVEN MORE- LATE THE NET THAT'S ONE ISSUE% THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT. THE ONE OF PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE ARE GETTING OLDER IT'S- WE HAVE QUITE A NUMBER OF IN THERE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY AND MANY OF THEM OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE. WILL BEEN DOING THIS FOR A VERY LONG TIME. HAVE BEEN TAKING IT VERY WELL FOR A VERY LONG TIME BUT BETWEEN. I'M NOT GETTING ENOUGH MONEY. AND THEIR WEIGHT IS NOT BEING COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT THEY CAN DO OTHER WHAT OTHER WAYS. AND MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE. AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE A LIVING. ARE THERE THERE'RE RETIRING AND THEIR NOT COMING BACK AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS. THE WAY THE START THE CREW A- YEAH. GREW OF CARE PROVIDER MOSTLY SHOW ME CHAU. WRITERS WHO WORK WITH THE BABIES IN THE TODDLERS FOR THE MOST PART. I'M TO COME ON BOARD- WE RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE STEIN FOUNDATION THAT- BRING THE PROCESS OF DOING YOUTUBE CHANNEL. THE START TO EDUCATE OUR- PEOPLE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU CAN. YOU KNOW TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN CHILDREN TAKE CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE WAY A LOT OF DAMAGE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ORIGINALLY GOT INTO THE FIELD WAS THEY THEY WERE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO STAY HOME WITH THEIR OWN KIDS. LOOKING FOR AN INCOME STREAM SO THE TWO CHILDREN WERE TO RENALDO WAS VERY AND THAT'S THAT I THAT MUST BE HOW YOU GOT INTO IT SO IT'S- OUR- YEAH. IN YOU ADD. THE PANDEMIC A NEEDING TO CLEAN AND THEN BEING AFRAID AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND WE NEED TO BUILD A MUCH STRONGER SUPPORT SYSTEM. I AM NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. OF CHILD CARE WORKERS PROVIDERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEY NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED BY THAT AND THEY NEED TO BE COMPENSATED ADEQUATELY TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. RUN ALL THE DID YOU WANT TO READ ALL THE DID YOU WANT TO ADD ON TO THAT AS FAR AS WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO KEEP. OUR FAMILY CHILD CARE SETTINGS OR ARE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS HOLD DURING ALL THIS. YES I SINCE- APPRECIATE ARM YOUR YOUR ADDRESS STATEMENTS AND THEY WERE VERY ELDERLY NAY WHAT'S YOUR I GUESS EDUCATION ROCK OR EARLY CARE ON THE EARLY FROM THE EASTERN EAST HAS BEEN AT TIMES. IN ACCEPTABLE OR IT MIGHT BE. OTHER PROGRAMS OUT I THE GENERAL MENTIONED THE ALLIANCE TWENTY YEARS AGO I ALSO. HILL AND WENT TO MEETINGS AND ROLL THE ALLIANCE THEY OUR WORK WITH OUR LAKE ALL YEAH I SENT A BURKE AND THEY SET UP THE CHILD CARE TRAINING INSTITUTE I WASN'T SURE I WAS A TRAINER PROGRAM UNTIL THE FUNDING. AVAILABLE SO WE TOP PROVIDERS WE WENT OUT TO THEIR- AFTER THEY ATTENDED SOMEBODY TRAINING. WE ARE THE TIGERS WILL GO TO THEIR HOMES AND HELP THEM ALSO IT'S JUST A BETTER. TO ME WE'RE GREAT IT WAS ON EXPERIENCE YOU KNOW WE ALL CAN LEARN FROM SITTING IN THE CLASSROOM AND BOX OR VIDEO BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT IN THE FIELD THAT PERSONAL TOUCH AND I BELIEVE THAT AND COMMUNITIES. ARE THROUGH THE CENTERS YOU KNOW IS NOT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THE KING ARE SINCE YES WE DO ALSO WE TELL OUR ARE PARENTS COMING IN THE BAY CURE FOR YOUR IS JUST OUT AND THIS IS HOW I GOT STARTED MY MOTHER IN LAW WORK MY FATHER IN LAW WORK THERE'S NO ONE FOR MY SON AND I WAS YOU KNOW YOUR MOTHER THIRTY ONE YEARS OLD BUT I MIGHT. DO SO I. CORPS THERE'S BEEN A MIX EVER ME I WAS ABLE TO BE THERE WITH MY SON ALSO CONTINUE MY EDUCATION AND I'M STILL LEARNING WHERE EVERY TRAINING OR WHATEVER THAT'S GOING ON YOU DO GET I'D LIKE THIS TO GET THE WORD OUT AND HOW IMPORTANT QUESTION IS AS FOR. EARLY IT WAS WE WERE. THE CITY JUST SIT ON BARNEY YOU KNOW SURROUND WHAT BOND WHERE MOVEMENT NOW WE ARE TEACHING WERE OUT THERE WE'RE DOING HAVING WORKFORCE JUST. ASK THAT WOULD TURN. WOMEN BUT THE MEN WERE THEIR OWN OFFICE AFTER NORTH BE THEIR OWN THEIR OWN BIZ PEOPLE AND THAT UP ECONOMIC GROWTH WHEN THEM AS WELL AS OUR- SO GAS. I THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU AND ALL THE FOR DRESSING THAT AND I HAVE A JOB TO FEW MORE QUESTIONS BUT I WILL NOTE FOR DOCTOR ALL NICK THAT DONE. THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT THEIR RATE STRUCTURE AND THE INADEQUATEAND OUT OF DATE- A RATE STRUCTURE AS YOU KNOW CENTER LEYVA AND I HAVE. JOINT BILLS WORKING ON AS SEND WORD. TALKING TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS BECAUSE WE REALIZE THIS IS NOT JUST A CO IN NINETEEN ISSUE AS YOU STATED BUT THIS WAS A LINGERING ISSUE. THAT DEALS WITH THE OVERALL FINANCIAL WHERE WITH ALL OF OUR CENTER SO. WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN THAT PIECE OF THANK YOU FOR REMINDING US. MAYBE WE CAN NOW GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ASK YOU- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS HERE. THE THERE JESSICA. I AM HERE YEAH YEAH OKAY ONE IS- ON IS HOW CAN WE HOLD HARMLESS- VOUCHER RECIPIENT PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY REMAIN OPEN WITH FEWER FAMILIES- TO SERVE I GUESS THAT'S TWO FOLD ONE IF YOU'RE FAMILIES JUST BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW THAT TOO IT MAY BE A REALITY AT WHAT YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY GOVERNOR'S NEW DIRECT. WE'LL BACK UP YOUR PEOPLE BEING IN A IN A FACILITY SO HOW WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. BASED ON THOSE TWO FACTORS. YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THIS IS JUST GO HOME TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- WE ARE LOOKING AT BOTH THE CHANGING GUIDELINES AROUND- SOCIAL DISTANCING- AS WELL AS- A RECENT GUIDANCE- GIVEN BY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL SERVICES- AND WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THAT IN CONJUNCTION WITH YOUR GLOBAL RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. I'M AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE A FEDERAL KERR'S ACTS FUNDS- AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS NOW IN OUR IN OUR NEW BUDGET PICTURE- WHERE WE ARE DISSIPATING- LESS RESOURCES OPPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THE RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS THE KEY ELEMENT. I'M TO RE OPEN OUR COMPANY. SO IN TERMS OF HOW I THINK WE'RE STILL I'M CONTEMPLATING YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT THAT TYPE OF THE STRUCTURE COULD LOOK LIKE- CERTAINLY OUR EXISTING RIGHT STRUCTURE WAS NOT- DEVELOPED WITH. SMALLER RATIOS IN MIND- SO THAT SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT I THINK WE WILL END UP HAVING- I'M SOME PRETTY YEAH- LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT- IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THOSE NEEDS. OKAY AND MY NEXT QUESTION FOR YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES RELATE TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE SHOW WORKERS WE AT THERE IS A IS A BIG NEED AS AS A DOCTOR ON LIKE SAID WITH THE CURRENT. HEALTH CARE WORKERS BUT THE REALITY IS THERE ARE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS THAT ARE BEYOND THAT TRUE DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH CARE THEIR- PEOPLE TO WORK IN RETAIL WHETHER THEY'RE AT. GROCERY STORES ARE DOOR DASHING OR OR AGRICULTURE. FARMWORKERS YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF. THE CENTRAL WORKERS WHO ARE LEFT OUT OF THIS AND SO- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE YOU YOU HAVE A JOB TO DO TO IT'S ALL ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS AND SO. WE HAVE THESE MONEY CAME IN THROUGH THE ALLOCATION AND THEY'RE BEING HELD BACK SO ARE YOU ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY HOLDING THE BACK. TO COVER THE HOLE THAT YOU THINK THAT WE MAY FACE THAT OUR CHILD CARE. BUDGET IN CALIFORNIA OR IS IT POTENTIAL TO USE THOSE MONIES NOW TO SERVE THE SENSOR WORKERS THAT NEED HELP TODAY. SO I WOULD NOT- NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT IDEA THAT WERE HOLDING THESE FUNDS BACK- WE NEED TO- PUT TOGETHER. SENATE SHOULD BE SPENT AND WE NEED TO GET THE WORD THE- INSURANCE ALREADY THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AS WELL- I THINK THAT WE SEE THAT POTENTIALLY HAPPENING TO ME REVISION- BUT THERE ARE OTHER AVENUES AS WELL SO IT'S NOT JUST A SIMPLE AS- WE IN THE FENCED ANNOUNCE OUR ALLOCATION IN THE MONEY STARTS LOW- SO. NO I DON'T I WOULDN'T SAY THAT WERE HOLE IN THE MONEY BACK OR SITTING ON THE MONEY- BUT THERE ARE QUITE A FEW NEEDS IN THE SYSTEM- AS AS OUR PANEL TODAY DESCRIBED. AND PART OF THAT THOSE KINDS IDENTIFYING WHICH OF THOSE NEEDS WE CAN USE THEM FOR OBVIOUSLY THREE UNDER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT GOING TO DO IT IN TERMS OF FOLKS ARE AT WORK WHAT TO CAN. THIS AT. YOU KNOW AT THE REQUIRE. AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE DEATH. GOING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON SHARKS I CAN RESPECT ANSWERS SO LET ME READ THAT NASA YOUR THAT YOU DO IT AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY- ARE WE LOOKING TO USE THOSE FEDERAL MONIES TO EXPAND ACCESS- TO CONTINUE ACCESS BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE QUESTION WE HAVE. AFINITE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND IN THIS DIFFICULT SITUATION SOMETIMES WILL BE FIGHTING JUST TO HOLD ON TO WHAT WE GOT BUT IN THIS CURRENT PANDEMIC COME OVERSEEING fNTED ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THE GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO CHANGE THINGS IN A MONTH FROM NOW. BUT ARE WE LOOKING AT THOSE RESOURCES TO. HOLD ON TO WHAT WE HAVE TO THE CURRENT ACCESS OR TO EXPAND ACCESS BECAUSE WE WERE HEARING FROM. YOU KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER IS NODDING HIS HEAD OVER HERE IN AND THE AG WORLD AND WE HEARING FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE RETAIL WORLD AND- YOU KNOW LOW WAGE WORKERS WHO HAVE THAT CURRENT. CHILD CARE NEED TODAY AND THERE IS SOME SO WORKERS TODAY YOU CAN GO OUT ON THE STREETS PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE YOU KNOW THESE ARE THOSE WORKERS AND SO. WE JUST HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THESE THESE TWO THINGS. SO ONE THING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHEN ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS THAT THERE ARE. PARAMETERS AND FEDERAL LAW- REGARDING THESE CARES FUNDS AND HOW THEY'RE USED. SO THE STATE. NOT USE THESE FUNDS TO- SUPPLANT EXISTING- APPROPRIATIONS AS GENERAL FUND- OUR STATE OTHER STATE FUNDS. FOR CHILDCARE- SO THEY HAVE TO BE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE'RE TO REIMBURSE THE STATE COSTS ASSOCIATED CO THE NINETEEN THAT WERE- IN CURRENT. AFTER THAT HE- THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS ANNOUNCED. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE NOT WE SEE THESE AS LIKE A BLACK FILL FOR EXISTING STATE FUNDS. ALLOWABLE AND PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL LOST SO- THIS WOULD BE IN ADDITION TO THAT AND AT MOST AGAIN. I'M BE REIMBURSED STATE. ALLOCATE FOR CLEANING. OKAY I THAT THAT'S A THINK SO IF. YEAH SO THAT. BASICALLY SAYS WE'RE LOOKINGTO EXPAND. NOT SUPPLANT WHICH WILL BE CURRENTLY AB I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS WITH THE PREFERRED- PAT THIS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND LAST QUESTION FOR YOU JESSICA WE TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER WITH THE- WITH THE K. TWELVE COMMUNITY ON THAT THE STOCKPILE THE PP STOCKPILE IN THIS MASSIVE ORDER THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE BILLION DOLLAR ORDER THAT. THAT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT'S GOING TO COME TO FRUITION SOON I KNOW WE ALLOCATE MONEY ALREADY FOR THIS BUT- HOW WILL THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDERS BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PP. ON ON A WELL THEY HAVE TO USE DIP INTO THEIR OWN RESOURCES EITHER THAT THEY HAVE IN THE CURRENT BUDGET OR THAT'S BEEN ALLOCATED THROUGH THIS. THESE LAST YOU KNOW A FEW MONTHS OR WILL JUST GET IN LINE AND MAKE IT MAKE AND- MAKE A REQUEST FOR THAT VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND I DID FOLLOW UP ON YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION WITH MY CONTACTS AND YES- AND- SO I HAVE AN ANSWER ON THE ON THE SCHOOLS QUESTION AS WHILE. I'M SO THAT AS- CHILD CARE PROVIDERS JUST LIKE AS AT ONLY A PROVIDER ELLIE EIGHTY. ELLIE IS THEY CAN WORK WITH THE THROUGH THE EXISTING CITY AND COUNTY- REGIONAL EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAMS THAT ARE IN THOSE AREAS TO ACCESS PP IF THEY CANNOT OTHERWISE GET IT THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT MEANS- AND- I CONTACTED- YES DID CONFIRM FOR ME THAT GENERALLY SPEAKING WHEN THOSE THOSE REQUESTS COME THROUGH IN THE- BY THE- THEY DON'T. I READ THAT I DID. CHARGE HOWEVER IT DOES NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT REGIONAL EMERGENCY AS PROCESS- AND I DO KNOW THAT- THAT THROUGH SOME SOME- SOME FOLKS ARE WORKING OVER DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF COUNTIES WORK WORKING WITH CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO ACCESS- NECESSARY SUPPLIES BOTH PP SANITIZING SUPPLIES. WELL AS- SO THAT'S IN IN SOME MONEY THAT SOUNDS LIKE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN HALF. OKAY THANK YOU FINALLY I HAVE TWO QUICK QUESTIONS FOR CD. THE FIRST IS RELATED TO OUR ACES PROGRAMMER AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME GUIDANCE OR DIRECTION COMING OUT. FOR THAT RELATED TO OUR SUMMER ACES PROGRAMS AND GRANTED A LOT OF THIS DEPENDS ON THE THIS STATE- MORTAR BUT ASSUMING THAT WE HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY- HOW ARE WE LOOKING WITH OUR ACES- PROGRAM CALIFORNIAN GUIDANCE FOR PROVIDERS. USE THAT MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AS CHAIR. THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WE ACTUALLY RELEASED AND GUIDANCE ON MONDAY THAT DIRECTED ALL OF OUR GREEN TEAS RACES IN TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THAT THEY WOULD BE GETTING EXTENDED GRANT AWARDS SO INSTEAD OF THE GRANT AWARD ANY NINETEEN THIRTY AT THAT WILL BE EXTENDED THROUGH DECEMBER. ALLOWS THEM TO YOU BUT A BAD AND GO DEEPER AND THEIR SUMMER MONTHS SO THAT THEY REALLY CAN BE PART OF THAT SOLUTION. IN ADDRESSING THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AROUND LEARNING AROUND CARE THAT ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION FOR CD IS-RELATED TO. PARENTS WHO ARE. WHO ARE ELIGIBLE. ONLY GO BACK TO THE ACES REAL QUICK I'M SORRY SERRA- CAN YOU CLARIFY ABOUT THE ASUS PROGRAM AND THE RATES WILL THEY GET THAT BETTER RATE THE HIGHER RATE. UNFORTUNATELY I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE RATE HE SAID THAT I'LL HAVE TO DROP IN AND SEE AND GET BACK TO YOU ARE NOT PLAN. OKAY NEXT BUT GOING BACK TO OUR CD CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. AND WE'RE HEARING FROM PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE THAT PARENTS ARE BEING CALLED AND ASKED TO GIVE UP THEIR CARE BECAUSE THERE ARE NOT WORKING OR THEY ARE SHELTERING IN PLACE- CAN CLARIFY. S. R. SOLDIERING IN PLACING FAMILIES. TO SEE TO CLARIFY THEY HAVE NOT LOST THEIR ELIGIBILITY. I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION WE WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR TO EVERYONE OUT THERE ARE FAMILIES THAT CAME IN BEFORE COULD NINETEEN. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR TWELVE MY- AND SO IN NOT IF THAT FAMILY IS NOT AN ESSENTIAL WORKER AND THEY HAVE DECIDED TO SHELTER PLACE AND FOLLOW THAT. THEY ARE STILL BEING HELD WITH THAT AND THEIR PROVIDER WHEN. HE A FAMILY MEMBER FAMILY CHILDCARE OR CENTER BASED. EITHER HE SAID GEN FOUR THROUGH OUR DIRECT CONTRACT. ARE CONTINUING TO RECEIVE THAT PAIN. THAT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US ON THE- TOP MAN ALLEGE ABOUT EIGHT. A LOT OF FAMILIES. AND OUR CELL PLAYS AND SUMMER COMING BACK TO THE PROGRAM NOW. ON PROGRAMS AT THE NOT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND IT IS NOT FOR US AND ASK THEM IF A FAMILY HAS CONTINUED TO GO TO CARE WE ARE PRESUMING THAT THEY ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. BECAUSE THEY NEEDED TO CONTINUE HAVING THEIR CHILDREN THEIR CHILD CARE SITUATION AND IF THEY'RE RETURNING TO CARE RIGHT NOW. IN SORT OF THING WE ARE AS- AS- HAS FOR THE ABILITY THERE ARE NEED TO WORKING A TO EARLY LEARN. CARE PROGRAM SO THAT THAT FAMILY CAN WORK AS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER. SO BOTH PARTS OF OUR THERE SHOULD BE COVERED WITH THIS PAIN STILL. FAMILIES BEANS OR AT. ALL FAMILIES SHOULD BE OUR STILL JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE TO CHECK AGAIN BUT NOT TOO OUT TO REDUCE AND NOT TO SPEND IF THEY'VE LOST A JOB AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE GIVING UP THEIR CARE THERE ARE MULTIPLE FOR THAT AND THEIR ARE EXPAND THEIR WORK BUT THIS HOURS DOWN THERE TWELVE. ELIGIBILITY OKAY THAT QUESTION ABOUT GO ON MEMBERS AT THAT FOR NOW I WANT TO CALL ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEE MON WHO HAS SOME QUESTIONS FOR HER AS A MEMBER THE COMMITTEE BUT IN ADDITION AS WE KNOW IS THE VICE CHAIR BECAUSE WILL POCKETS AND THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGED MINISTRATION ON THESE AS A CHILD CARE SHE SOME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND THE BEING I'M ND AS AS THE CHAIR SAID FOR THE OVER TWO DECADES THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAS PRIORITIZE CHILD CARE I'M IN IN THOSE TWO DECADES WE EVERY YEAR RECOGNIZE AT. THE CHILD CARE WE DO HAVE IS NOT ENOUGH SUFFICIENT- IT TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF THE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THIS SITUATION IS THAT IT'S JUST EXASPERATED THAT THE PROBLEM- TO A GREATER LEVEL AND THERE ARE SEVERAL ISSUES THE THING CAME UP THAT HAVE COME UP APRIL TENTH THE LETTER IN WOMEN'S AKIS. EACH LETTER TO THE GOVERNOR- THEY WANT TO BE THERE IT'S A- PARTIES. THE BOB CAN AKAKA. AN AND WE DID CHARACTERIZE AND I DO RESPECT THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE AT A- HERE TODAY BUT WE DID OUR TO RISE- THAT WE WANTED- THE FUND THE FEDERAL FUNDS RELEASED- FAIR ENOUGH IF THERE'S A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE POWER WORDING THAT- IT. IS SOMETHING THAT WE STILL- CARE ABOUT WE'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE TIME LINE IS TO DETERMINE HOW AND WHEN. THE IS MY BE GETTING TO. THE PROVIDE CELLS- ADDITIONALLY WE ASKED FOR A THIRTY DAY. THE HOW A WHOLE A THIRTY DAY HOME HOLD HARMLESS- FOR CLOSE PROVIDERS- PARTICULARLY OUT OF FEAR THAT WE ARE GOING TO LOSE- SOME OF THE PROVIDERS- THAT WE HAVE NOW- AND EVEN COMING UP FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SET THUS FAR- A WE MAY. ALSO SEE THAT WOULD YOU KNOW A YEAR OR TWO DOWN THE LINE WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET- WILL BE EVEN MORE SHORT. OF THE NEED THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE AND IT'LL BE MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO FIND PROVIDERS- AND IN THE THIRD DAY THAT WE ASKED FOR WAS HAZARD PAY FOR A CHILD. CARE WORKERS AND SO I JUST WANT TO I WANT THAT LETTER AND TO GO INTO THE RECORD BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS- HAS BEEN. A CHAMPION MEAN FOR MANY DECADES. BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING. EACH AND EVERY YEAR WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE AS A STATE TO MEET THE DEMAND- FOR CHILD CARE. NOW WE DID IT AT. YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THIS PANDEMIC- THE SYSTEM WAS ALREADY STRUGGLING AS I SAID TO MEET THE NEEDS- AND NOW. WE ARE REALLY LOOKING AND FOCUSING AT OUR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND IT WAS A REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK TO HAVE THE PERSPECTIVE- NALDO- YOU KNOW JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU HAVE TO CHANGE YOUR HOURS BECAUSE NOW THE WORKERS. IN THE IN. NEED MORE FLEXIBLE THAN EVER BE THE DEMAND IS HIGH FREE CENTRAL WORKERS. SO I THINK JUST HEARING THAT PERSPECTIVE HOW IT'S IMPACTING. A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT WHAT WE DO AS A STATE- RIGHT NOW TO EVEN MEET. EVEN MEET THE NEEDS OF A SET WORKERS I'M IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME KNOWING THAT WE CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE STATE BUT JUST LOOKING AT SMALL SECTOR- WHAT IS LEFT FOR US. TO CONSIDER AND TO DO- A IN TERMS OF THAT MEETING THAT DEMAND FOR EAST CENTRAL WORKERS. WHOEVER WANTS TO TAKE A STAB AT THAT. THANK YOU ARE SENATOR LEMOND AND YOU KNOW WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH AND YOU SPONSORED ARE BILL EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY EIGHT HE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE YOU JUST. SUCH A BLESSING BUT IF THERE ARE GOOD CAN I GIVE AN XAMPLE- I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE NAME OF MY RESEARCH AND WE ARE ALL. BUT THEY SENT OUT A QUESTIONNAIRE WHAT IS SHOW. MATERIALS ARE THEY WERE CALLED PPVS. YEAH WE NEED AND SO BECAUSE OF GROW THE WONDERFUL HELP WITH MY NEIGHBORS MY FAMILIES IN OUR PROGRAM. THEY SUPPLIED US WITH SO MANY THINGS. THE ONLY THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE. ACCESS TO AT THAT TIME OR MASS. AND THEY ALSO IN THE QUESTIONNAIRE ASKED HOW MAYBE HOW MANY STAFF. DO SO IS MY ASSISTANT- MYSELF SO THAT'S WHAT I PUT DOWN ONLY ASPER MASS SO THEN THEY CALLED OKAY IT'S DONE PRETTY GOOD TO GET YOUR SUPPLIES WE DRIVE CLEAR TO COMBAT. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SAY WHERE MY RESOURCE AND REFERRAL AGENCIES AND THEY GAVE US YOU. ASKED HE W. WHAT. NOT RIGHT MY PROBLEM SO MAYBE IF I FLOOD BUTLATER THEY CALLED THEM BOUGHT OUT FOR ONLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS ON MY ARTICLE USE WAIT. I'M SORRY BUT I FOR ALL PROVIDE IF YOU HAVE THINGS YOU KNOW. TO THE- AS A LOAF OF BREAD GIVEN UP OF WRITING ABOUT NOT G. THE FISH MADE FISH IN THE YOU KNOW WHAT WELL AND ALL THE COOL PEOPLE WE. WE JUST WOULD LIKE WHAT WHAT YOU CAN TO OFFER IF IT A NOT LEAST LET US KNOW. ONE OF THE PROVIDERS IN MY GET OUT TO VOTE GROUP HAD TRIED TO GET SUPPLIES ALSO AND SHE WAS LIKE THEY BALK. AT IT WILL TOGETHER SO. WHAT DO YOU NEED TO THE DISINFECTANTS BLEACHED ONESELF OR IT SOUNDS LIKE CALL HER THEY DIDN'T HAVE BELIEVES THEY DIDN'T HAVE. THANKS THEY DIDN'T ARE THE DISINFECTANT WIPES SO I SAID IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE USE SHE WAS CRYING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CARING AND THINKING ABOUT ME MY SISTER BUT SHE SAID SHE HAD CHALLENGES. THAT FOR HER CHILDREN BUT YOU KNOW SO WE'RE HELPING OTHER BUT WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THESE THINGS WE ALSO DON'T MIND LICENSE AT CAUGHT. TRYING TO GET. IT DIDN'T MATTER THEY STILL PUT US ON THE LINE FOR TWO A HALF HOURS THEN WE DIDN'T UNABLE TO LEAVE THE GOOD. BECAUSE I'M MORE. THANK YOU PROVIDING THAT PERSON AND YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS A THINK SPOKEN TO LEGISLATORS ABOUT. THE THIS SERIOUS DIFFICULTY IN AND FINDING SUPPLIES FOR CHILDCARE WORKERS AND I'M WONDERING IF ANYONE FROM THE STATE CAN I RESPOND TO THAT AND LET US KNOW WHAT IT WHAT IS THE STATE DOING TO. I MEAN THERE WAS MY INITIAL QUESTION OF WHAT ARE WE DOING TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR US TO WORKERS BUT THEN THERE'S THE QUESTION NOW WHAT ARE WE DOING TO GET BASIC HEALTH. AND SAFETY SUPPLIES TO HEALTH CARE. THAT VERY HIGH PRICE IS NOT BEING ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM BULK PURCHASING- AND I'M WONDERING IF THE STATE CAN PLEASE RESPOND TO THAT. AND THIS IS JUST GOT HOME FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO- YOU KNOW WE IS SP I'M SORRY. AND WE PROVIDED AT THROUGH. A SECTION THIRTY SIX LADDERS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP. A CHILD CARE PROVIDERS PURCHASE THE SUPPLIES THEY NEED IN ORDER TO CLEAN SANITIZED- AND PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR THEMSELVES- HOWEVER WE RECOGNIZE THAT- NOT ALL. PROVIDERS HAD ACCESS YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN HAVE THE DOLLARS BUT NOT THIS DALY THE ACCESS TO- SUPPLIES THEMSELVES. AS I NOTED THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH ME IN CITY. I AM. AGENCY THAT REPRESENTS- THEIR REGIONS I'M WITH IN THAT STATEWIDE EMERGENCY STRUCTURE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL SUPPLIES. BUT ALSO- YOU KNOW LOOKING AT DIFFERENT OPTIONS BE ABOUT PAUL I'M WORKING WITH OUR OTHER PARTNER. BUT THIS IS A FULL TUITION- YOU KNOW IT'S- I'M IT IS IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK ON- BUT IT'S REALLY HELPFUL TO HEAL HERE WITH THE EXPERIENCES HAVE BEEN ON THE ON THE GROUND LEVEL. I QUESTION AND REMEMBER THE MAN THIS IS THE KIND OF A MARKET THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT AND DAD. SO WHERE THE ONES WHO ARE ADDRESSING THE FIFTEEN AND THAT YOU ALL OF THE- STATE AND- INSURE THAT CLEANING SUPPLIES GET OUT TO YOU ARE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. SO DOES FUNDS RIGHT OUR CITY THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE A LOT THAT SHOULD BE GOING OUT TO OUR SUMMER FOR LIKE. TWO DAYS. NOT THERE I LIKE HE'S IN. SAID THOSE. WILL GO TO EACH OF OUR ARE NOT. WORK WITH. OUR LEARNING. CARE PROVIDERS. COMMUNITIES BUT AS- JUST AS BAD DEPARTMENT OF ONE OF THE ISSUE IS AN ACCESS SO WE KNOW RIGHT ACROSS THIS IS A VARIETY OF ACCESS ISSUES NOT JUST FOR EARLY LEARNING CARE BUT ALSO STILL FOR HEALTH CARE AND RATHER SECTORS SO I THINK. THE SHORTER IT'S THERE'S A COMPETING DEMANDS BUT WE DO KNOW AND WE'VE SEEN PICTURES FROM SOME OF OUR AROUND IN SAN DIEGO AND OTHER PLACES WHERE REALLY ARE AS HE SAID HE COUNTY WORKING WITH OUR AND OURS FIRST FIVE COUNTY COMMISSION AND- EIGHT PEOPLE. SORT OF THAT WHOLE WORLD GATHERED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR PURCHASING THINGS AND GETTING THEM TO THE PROVIDER SO WE NEVER NEVER FAST ENOUGH WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT WOULD GET IN THE WAY ITHINK THAT YOU KNOW SOME RESORT WILL BE KIND. OUT OF WORK OUT FOR. LOCAL IT CAN SEE. CONTRACTS OR AN ALLEY A- OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL WANTED TO DO THAT ADD ON TO THIS ISSUE AND THEN GO BACK TO MY MEMORY LOSS YES THE THANK YOU JUST WANT TO JUMP HERE APPRECIATE THAT A SUMMER LEAGUE AMONG- I'M MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE IS THERE ARE ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS WITH REGARD TO HOW- ELLIE A- AND I ASSUME CHILD PROVIDERS WILL GET. THE P. HE COMES OUT OF THE STATE. THE STATE'S. SENATE TO THE COUNTY- THEY COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER HER THERE THAT THE COUNTY. THE COUNTY- HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEN IT IS DOLED OUT. BY I ASSUME THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER IN AGAIN THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND AM I CORRECT ON THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO OTHER PATH. OTHER THAN SEEING OF A PRIVATE PROVIDER THAT ONE WOULD GO TO. GET P. P. M. I. N. CORRECTION I BECAUSE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS JUST IS THE SYSTEM IS. IS RATHER ESTABLISH THE PROTOCOLS ARE RATHER ESTABLISH AND THAT IS THE PATH. OF HOW WE GET P. P. P. P. V. E. OUT. TO THOSE WHO NEED IT COULD COULD SOMEONE pRIGHT ON ALL THIS IS JUST CONSIDER PART OF FINANCE YES THERE IS THAT PROCESS- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT AND ALLOWS FOR THE STATE SRPRISED DISTRICT. I AGREE I JUST GET A LITTLE CONFUSING PEOPLE SAY WELL. YEAH THIS MIGHT HAPPEN AND THEN. WE'RE INTO A LETTER AND THINGS LIKE THAT THAT'S I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S NOT NECESSARY AS MUCH AS THERE'S A PATH IT SHOULD WE ONE SHOULD NOT DEVIATE FROM THAT PATH CAN'T GET IT FROM A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR. THEY NEED ITIS ESSENTIAL THEY CALL THEIR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER THERE COUNTY HA HEALTH OFFICER THEN GETS IT TO THEM THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. OF THE ESTABLISHED PROTOCOL RIGHT NOW AND THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING AND THEN NOT DEVIATING FROM THAT. BECAUSE YOU'RE PROBABLY JUST GONNA SPIN YOUR WHEELS OF AND HEARD FROM. OUR CLASSIFIED FOLKS. THAT ARE ON THE LINE RIGHT NOW TEACHERS IN GENERAL ARE AT SCHOOL TIGHTS BUT THE CLOCK BY TRUCKS ARE PROVIDING MEALS THAT THEY NEED SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT- TODAY APPARENTLY. THE OWNER OF THE- HE GOVERNOR ORDER FROM SOMEONE ARRIVED IN CALIFORNIA SO. I'M EXPECTING THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE A HUGE PROBLEM GIVEN THAT WE HAVE PROTOCOLS- TO ADDRESS LOGISTICS AND GIVEN THAT WE JUST HAVE MORE OF THEM LANDED HERE TODAY WITH THAT THANK YOU. IF I THE- BREAK IN FOR A SECOND ON ON THE WHOLE ISSUE PPVS AND HOW THEY'RE COMING TO US. UP UNTIL THIS POINT THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF. MASKS OR CLEANING SUPPLIES OR ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE TO RECEIVE AND WE'VE SORT OF GONE TO ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND ASKED WHOEVER WE CAN FOR DONATIONS TO BUY THEIR OWN SUPPLIES TO GIVE AWAY WE'VE GOTTEN SOME DONATIONS FROM VARIOUS PLACES THIS BUT THERE HAVEN'T BEEN A LOT OF MASKS AVAILABLE ANYWHERE. UP UNTIL NOW SO FULLY WITH WITH- HEARING FROM THE STATE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE IN ANY AVAILABLE- WILL BE ABLE TO USE THOSE KIND OF PROTOCOLS BUT UP UNTIL NOW IT'S KIND OF THE WILD WILD WEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHICKEN I SAYS. YES HE DID DID YOU GO TO YOUR COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOUR COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER IN ASKING FOR VP.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOWN THIS IS SERRA NOVEL MARKET WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I WANT TO CLARIFY A PART OF IT IS WELL IT'S BEYOND- OR MAYBE LESS AND THE P. P. AND ADDS BASIC FACE COVERINGS WE'VE ALSO HAD EARLY LEARNING CARE PROVIDERS NOT BE ABLE TO GET DIAPERS. OR FOR ANY LACK AT BB WHITE SUGGESTS BASIC SUPPLIES THAT YOU WOULD NEED WHEN YOU'RE CARRYING FOR YOUNG CHILDREN HAS BEEN PART OF WHAT THEY NEEDED. STATE HEALTH AND SAFETY SO JUST BEING ABLE TO USE SOME BLEACH. OR OTHER CLEANING PRODUCTS TO WAIT THINGS DOWN. SO THE PP EASIER RIGHT ARE VERY MUCH PART OF THE STATE SUPPLY CHAIN. AND THEN THERE'S OTHER RESOURCE SAYS THAT WE'VE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR EARLIER MEANING CARE PROGRAMS AND SO. WE'RE TALKING MORE THAT AND GET THAT AND YES WE ARE PUTTING PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH THEIR KIDS HE THROUGH THAT. PART OF THE PP SUPPLY CHAIN. AT IN TRYING TO ADDRESS OTHER NEEDS TO MAKE SURE CHILDREN ARE AND HEALTH. AND SAFETY IMPAIRMENTS. THANK YOU. SO AS A FOLLOW UP TO THAT THEN YOU KNOW IT'S CLEAR THAT OUT OF NECESSITY- NOT EVERYONE HAS FOLLOWED THE SAME A PROCESS BUT WHEN DO WE EXPECT IF WE HAVE A SHIPMENT OF MASS COMING IN TO THE STATE'S THAT WAS ORDERED BY THE GOVERNOR WHEN DO WE EXPECT AT LEAST FOR CHILD CARE WORKERS THAT THEY WILL SEE A SURPRISE DO WITH THE TIME. LINE FOR THAT. THIS IS JUST GONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION- I CAN REACH OUT THOUGH TO- MY COUNTERPARTS AND REYES. YES AND- TO WRITE INFORMATION I CAN GET FOR YOU. THANK YOU THAT WOULD BE GREAT. AND YOU KNOW FINALLY AT YESTERDAY THERE WAS A CALL THAT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS HAD WITH OUR GOVERNOR. AND WE LEARNED THAT SIXTY ONE PER OF LICENSE ENTERS AND SIX POINT 5% OF LICENSED FAMILY CHILD CARE HOMES. HAVE CLOTHES DO YOU DO CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- THE YOU KNOW THE QUESTION THAT WE ALL HAVE BEEN IN LEAGUE. IS WHETHER OR NOT. OPEN AND BUT WHAT A- I'M WE STILL WERE THAT. 7% US AND SIX POINT FIVE PERCENT- EACH OF THOSE- CENTERS WILL. OR WILL OPEN AND TO THAT EXTENT BUT DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA NOW I KNOW THE GOVERNOR MADE ON SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS TODAY- FOR IT FOR CHILD WILL BROADLY BUT INCLUDING AYE CHILD CARE CENTERS TO DO WE ANTICIPATE WHAT THE WHAT THE EXPANSION MIGHT LOOK LIKE IN THE NEXT. FEW WEEKS. YES THANK YOU THIS IS JESSICA AGAIN FROM THE NEED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY WAS THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE IS AN IMPORTANT IN GETTING I'M CHILD CARE FACILITIES AS WELL SCHOOLS BACK ONLINE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT- OPENING BACK UP THE ECONOMY. AND CAN'T GO BACK BACK TO WORK UNLESS THEY HAVE CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN- SO WHAT THE GOVERNOR WAS INDICATING WAS AND THAT WE ARE STARTING TO LOOK AT WHAT IS GOING TO BE NEEDED- ON IT. IT IS THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO HELP SUPPORT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS OPENING AND GETTING THEM ACCESS DISH ACCESS TO CARE- SO THAT THAT IS WHAT IS SIGNALING AND WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE- A LOT OF. DETAILS TO SHARE BUT- IS THE NAY STEP ARE SAYING IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. THANK YOU AND I THINK AS THOSE PLANS- BECAUSE I MET AS YOU'LL UNDERSTAND MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE PLAN AND ALSO TIME LINES I THINK FOR US AT LEAST FOR ME I'M KNOWING ANTI WHITE TIMELINE OF WHEN I CAN EXPECT SOMETHING- HELPS US UNDERSTAND IS THIS A MATTER OF WEEKS OR MONTHS BEFORE WE HAVE CERTAIN INFORMATION- I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL BUT I APPRECIATE. THE FACT THAT EVERYONE'S DOING AS MUCH AS I CAN THIS OF THE MANY ISSUES- THAT WE ARE FACING IN THE STATE AND- I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT'S BEING PUT INTO THIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY. QUESTION BACK HERE IT WAS ONE QUESTION OUT GALLAGHER HE'S STEPPED OUT. IN THE INTERIM LET ME ASK ONE MORE QUESTION FROM. A CD OR TWO MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT HERE. AS FAR AS THE- AS FAR AS THE RATIOS FOR- FOR IF YOUR FEET YOUR KIDS OUT HOW WILL THAT WORK FOR THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM SAYS FOR CD. THANK YOU FOR ASKING THAT I STAND. HERE THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARKET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF THAT SO. AS YOU INDICATE. WITH THAT NEED FOR SOME SOCIAL GUIDANCE AROUND MASTER SOCIAL DISTANCE SCENE WE HAVE DECREASED GREAT SIZE. AT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND PUT OUT ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON THAT SO FOR OUR DIRECT CONTRACTED PROGRAMS THEY'RE BEING HELD HER LESS SO AS THEY PROVIDE THEIR CARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET LAST. FINDING REIMBURSEMENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT THEY'RE SERVING AS WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE MUCH SMALLER GROUP I SAID. AS WE LOOK AT OTHER PARTS OF OUR PROGRAMS. ACROSS THE STATE NAME. AND SERVICES I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO INDICATE THAT AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL BE. STATION ON OVERTIME. WHAT IS THE LOOK LIKE FOR THINGS LIKE A REGIONAL MARKER RATE WHAT COST IS. REALLY HER AT THE LOOK AT SMALLER GRIP SIZES BUT I WOULDN'T HAVE ED DIRECTORS STREET YUP WHAT WE'RE RIGHT NOW. BRECHT ACTED BROWN'S. LIKE THIS JUST LEAVE TO YOU TODAY WITH. PANEL YES IT WAS THE HEARING. DAYS ASSIST BLUR SO YESTERDAY WE HAD A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS THAT PRESIDENT CEO THE SAN FRANCISCO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TALKING ABOUT RESTAURANTS. AND HE WAS SAYING THAT IF ALL THINGS GO WELL. THEY CAN OPEN UP THE RESTAURANTS IT'S GET FRANCISCO WOULD HAVE ABLE CAPACITY I THINK HE SAID LIKE TWENTY TO FORTY PERCENT. AND HE WAS SAYING THAT. THAT'S NICE TO GET CUSTOMERS BACK IN BUT IN REALITY THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR RESTAURANTS AT A HUNDRED PERCENT. TO JUST ABOUT. RIGHT THEN TO MAKE MONEY WITH ALL THE COSTS THEY HAVE PAGES ENSURE SO WITH SO. TO SAY THING THE CENTER BASED PROGRAMS WE TALKED EARLIER ABOUT THE THEIR REIMBURSEMENT RATES WITH WHICH WE ARE INADEQUATE WORK ON LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH DOCTOR ALL AN ACT. AND SO WE HAD THE MINIMUM WAGE DIRECTIVES AND THE RATE STRUCTURE SO. OUT THIS KIND OF LIKE THE RESTAURANT IF YOU IF YOU WERE KIDS IN YOUR- IN YOUR- HOME CENTER. HOW'S THAT MATHEMATICALLY PENCIL OUT WHAT WILL WHAT AM I MISSING HOW'S THAT GOING TO WORK IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT GONNA WORK. AND THIS IS THEIR NUMBER MARKET AGAIN YOU'RE ASKING SOME REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS THAT OUR TEAM HERE IS ALSO. WRESTLING LAND I THINK AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION THE RIGHT THERE'S ALWAYS FIXED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A PROGRAM SO WHAT YOU BROUGHT UP SOME OF THOSE FIXED COSTS. I KNEW IN THE PAST THERE BEEN INNOVATIONS SUCH AS TWILIGHT PRO GROUNDS DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I THINK ALL OF US TOGETHER ARE GOING TO HAVE REALLY INNOVATIVE. AROUND OUR I DO NEED I AN OPENING BACK UP AND WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE AND I COULD TELL YOU RIGHT NOW EXACTLY. I JUST NEVER REALLY. THIS AND- WITH ALL OF YOU HELLO. AS AS WORKING MINISTRY. TO FIND. POLLUTION DURING WHAT WE KNOW IS ALSO GOING TO BE AN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING BY THAT TIME. YEAH I THINK THE REALITY HERE IS THAT OUR LAST HEARING WE TALKED ABOUT. IS THE- NOT REAL. BILL AT. THIS TO EXPAND ACCESS WE'LL BE LUCKY TO GET MONEY AND THROUGH. FEDERAL MONEY THROUGH OUR ONE TIME RAINY DAY FUNDS IN THROUGH DEFERRALS AND SMOKING HERE'S TACK TACTICS OF SOMEBODY MAY SAY JUST TAKE KEEP WHAT WE HAVE. STABLE UNLIKE THE LAST RECESSION WHERE WE CUT- WAS A HUNDRED THOUSAND. SLOTS AND NEVER GOT THEM ALL BACK AND SO WE DON'T WANT TO DO THAT- SOME ARE DWINDLING JUST. BECAUSE THE VIABILITY PROGRAMS AS WELL AS WE HEAR TODAY. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THIS IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROGRAM. THAT HAS YOUR KIDS YOU EITHER. BY DEFINITION WILL SERVE FEWER KIDS AND SQUEEZE OUT FAMILIES AND RATION ACCESS OR YOU'LL HAVE TO CABS ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO SUPPLEMENT BECAUSE IT'LL COST MORE TO HAVE THOSE RATIOS LOWER AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS LAW MONEY COMES AND SO. HOW DO WE RECONCILE THOSE TWO THINGS WITH. NOT WANTING TO LIMIT ACCESS AND SQUEEZE OUT. SQUEEZE OUT FAMILIES AND- MAKE SURE THESE THESE PROGRAMS CAN CAN PENCIL OUT. FINANCIALLY. SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE ROOM WITH THAT SAID WE STRUGGLE WITH SOME OF THE SAME REALLY HARD CHOICES AND THE A LOT OF THIS IS TO BE MADE MOVING FORWARD BUT WE'RE REALLY HAPPY TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AND CONTINUE DON'T COME THROUGH ALL OF OUR DATA.
