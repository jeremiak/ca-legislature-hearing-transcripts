WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MOVE THROUGH FIRST UP IS FALL ITEM. FIFTEEN THE- LABOR ARE YOU PREPARED FOR FALL ITEM FIFTEEN. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE SENATE BILL FOUR TEN BY SENATOR LEYVA AN ACT RELATING TO OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH- LABOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SP FOUR TEN TO ENSURE THAT WORKER SAFETY IS NEVER DELAYED OR SATISFIED AS A RESULT OF DUPLICATIVE EXPENSIVE AND UNNECESSARY ANALYSIS. IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEN GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN SIGNED INTO LAW SB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO PREPARE AN IN DEPTH ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF ANY REGULATION WITH AN ESTIMATED FISCAL IMPACT OF OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS ECONOMIC AND ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT IS CALLED THE STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT ALSO KNOWN AS THE SHARIA. WHEN IT COMES TO WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH REFORMS WE'RE ALREADY AWARE OF THE EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT EXISTS BEFORE YOU RULE CAN BE FINALIZED. THOSE STEPS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. WHAT A BILL SIGNED INTO LAW IT OFTEN DIRECTS THE CALIFORNIA OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS BOARD TO TAKE ACTION ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE. TO MULTIPLE ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS THREE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT WHICH FURTHER ASSESS THE PHYSICAL IMPACT FISCAL IMPACT. AND FOR THE O. S. H. S. B. THEN EXTENSIVELY REVIEWS THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ANY STANDARD. BY THIS POINT AT LEAST FOR. THOROUGH FISCAL ANALYSES WILL HAVE BEEN A KURT HAVE OCCURRED FOR THE RULE MAKING PROCESS TO BE COMPLETED. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WHAT THE SHARIA REVIEW MANDATES A FIFTH FIFTH FISCAL ANALYSIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS ALREADY VERY THOROUGH PROCESS. THE TREE CAN EXTEND THE RULE MAKING PROCESS BY ONE TO TWO YEARS. OR MORE AND IN TURN CONTINUE TO ENDANGER THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS IN THE WORKPLACE HE FURTHER DELAY IN ADOPTING SAFETY STANDARDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. AND I'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH MULTIPLE LEVELS OF ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW. THIS MAY PLACE WORKERS AT AN INCREASED RISK OF SERIOUS INJURY OR EVEN DEATH. PROPOSALS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE SHARIA SUCH AS THE INDOOR HEAT STANDARD REQUIRED BY SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE DELAYS AS A RESULT OF THIS PROCESS. THE LANGUAGE WHEN LANGUAGE FOR THE INDOOR HEAT STANDARD HAS YET TO EVEN BE PRESENTED TO THE O. S. H. S. B. DESPITE LEGISLATION REQUIRING THIS TO HAPPEN OVER TWO YEARS AGO. THAT IS TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS THUS FAR THE INDOOR WORKERS HAVE LABORED AND GRUELING HEAT WITH NO CLEAR HE PROTECTIONS UNDER THE LAW. WELL THE PANDEMIC IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THIS DELAY IN JANUARY ONE OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THE DEADLINE WAS ALREADY LONG GONE WHEN COVERT APPEARED A YEAR LATER. ALSO IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO SIGNIFICANT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WERE APPROVED IN SIX TO SEVEN MONTHS WHAT PROTECTING WORKERS FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE AND ANOTHER FROM COVERT NINETEEN. AS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THESE DID NOT REQUIRE SHARIA BUT THE REGULATIONS STILL RECEIVED THROUGH VETTING THOROUGH VETTING WITH THE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGENCY ANALYSIS AND STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK. THESE AND OTHER EXPERIENCES HAVE CONFIRMED THAT SHARIA BRINGS A LITTLE TO THE WORKER SAFETY RULE MAKING PROCESS. OTHER THAN GREATER DELAYS AS SUCH AS BEFORE TEN EXAMS WORKER SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FROM THE REQUIREMENT THAT ISRAEL MUST BE PERFORMED WITH SUCH REGULATION IS PROJECTED TO A FISCAL IMPACT. OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. ALL OTHER EXIT LAYERS OF REVIEW INCLUDING INTERNAL FISCAL ANALYSIS THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE PROCESS THE OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC HEARINGS. AND MEETINGS AND THE RULEMAKING STANDARD REMAIN IN PLACE THIS BILL WRISTLET RESEARCH REFLECTS THE EXCEPTIONALLY DETAILED FISCAL. ANALYSIS THAT ALREADY OCCURS DURING THIS PROCESS AND ALLOWS THE AFFECTED AGENCIES TO FOCUS SCARCE RESOURCES. IN MORE EFFECTIVE WAYS MEMBERS THIS BILL IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME WITH MORE WAREHOUSES IN SENATE DISTRICT TWENTY THAN ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY AND ONLY ONE OTHER PLACE. IN THE WORLD WE NEED TO HAVE AN EAGLE INDOOR HEAT STANDARD WHICH HAS BEEN PASSED THAT WAS THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN. NOW WE NEED THAT RULE MAKING TO BE DONE TO PROTECT THESE WORKERS MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE. THANK YOU. ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. ON FALL ITEM FIFTEEN. CENTERMAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES HI- I'VE BEEN TOLD THAT SINCE THE ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT OF AN ECONOMIC IMPACT WAS PASSED BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THERE HAVE BEEN ZERO NEW REGULATIONS PASSED OUT OF THIS S. R. I. A. PROCESS THE REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND THAT IS DEEPLY TROUBLING TO ME THAT SUGGESTS THERE SOMETHING FLAWED WITH THIS APPROACH. THAT BEING SAID I ALSO STRUGGLED AFFECTED I FEEL LIKE HAVING AN ECONOMIC IMPACT IN UNDERSTANDING- WE'RE A REGULATION WILL COME DOWN TO WHAT ITS EFFECTS WILL BE IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE SO- FOR THOSE REASONS I'M GONNA STAY OFF THIS BILL HE AND YOU KNOW I DO THINK THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THIS BUT I THINK INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS WE MAKE NEW REGULATIONS.

SENATE BILL FOUR THIRTY FOUR BY SENATOR BATES AN ACT RELATING TO HEALTH AND CARE FACILITIES SENATOR ROACH. THANK YOU- HOME MADAM PRESIDENT MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SP FOUR THIRTY FOUR PROHIBITS AN OPERATOR OF A LICENSED RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITY OR A CERTIFIED ALCOHOL OR OTHER DRUG PROGRAM PROVIDING ANY FORM OF FALSE ADVERTISING. OR MARKETING SERVICES MY NAME THIS BUILD BRANDON'S LAW IN HONOR OF BRANDON NELSON WHO TRAGICALLY DIED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND I'M LICENSED REHAB HOME. HIS PARENTS TO SIGN BRANDON OUT FOR CARE AT THE HOME WE'RE SURE THAT HE WOULD RECEIVE THERAPY SESSIONS A CASE MANAGER THE HOUSE MANAGER AND MORE UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS NOT WHAT HE RECEIVED ACCORDING TO A COMPREHENSIVE INVESTIGATION. BY THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NEWS GROUP IT FOUND AND I QUOTE NELSON DIDN'T HAVE A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS OVERSEEING IS TRANSITION HE APPARENTLY DIDN'T EVEN GET HIS MEDICATIONS ON TIME ACCORDING TO HIS PARENTS AND POLICE REPORTS. WHAT THEY GOT WERE SALES PITCHES NOT HEALTH CARE ADVICE THE NELSONS CONCLUDED END QUOTE I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS A LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE THAT NO PERSON HAS TO EXPERIENCE WHAT BRANDON IS HIS FAMILY WENT THROUGH. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS RECOGNIZED THAT CONSUMERS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS HAVE DISABLING CONDITIONS AND THAT THESE CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE VULNERABLE. HOWEVER THERE ARE NO PROVISIONS IN THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO CONTROL UNETHICAL MARKETING PRACTICES THAT PREY ON DISTRESSED FAMILIES OR INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS WHO ARE SEEKING TREATMENT. AS A RESULT PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES CAN BE MISLED MISDIRECTED AND MISDIAGNOSED BY AND QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS THE GOAL OF THE SP FOUR THIRTY FOUR USED TO PROTECT INDIVIDUALS WITH ADDICTION AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING THE TREATMENT THEY ARE. PROMISED MARKETEERS WHO KNOW FINALLY AND WE'LL MAKE MATERI FALSE STATE. WHETHER IT OUT. OR BY DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PATIENTS MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE S. B. FOR THIRTY FOUR AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. TO INVESTIGATE ALLEGATIONS OF MISCONDUCT AND IMPOSE SANCTIONS ULTIMATELY THE MEASURE SEEKS TO PROTECT THOSE WERE AT THEIR MOST VULNERABLE AND SEEKING TREATMENT. THE BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS AND THE ADVOCATES FOR RESPONSIBLE TREATMENT. A SIMILAR VERSION OF THIS BILL. PASSES COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY IN TWENTY NINETEEN BUT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR THIS CURRENT BILL ADDRESSES THOSE CONCERNS AND HAS RECEIVED NO VOTES NO NO VOTES.

SENATE BILL THREE SIXTY THREE BY SENATOR LEYVA AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. EARLIER THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS SENATE BILL S. B. THREE SIXTY THREE WILL ENSURE THAT THE AMERICAN LEGION AND THE AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY PROVIDES SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SIMILAR ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO STUDENTS AS WELL AS NOT DISCRIMINATE BASED ON GENDER SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL FURTHERS CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF PROVIDING EQUITABLE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO ALL STUDENTS BY REQUIRING BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS STATE AND GIRLS STATE PROGRAMS TO OFFER THE FOLLOWING. SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR SIMILAR CURRICULUM SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND FACILITIES TWENTY ONE NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR GIRLS TO PARTICIPATE AS THERE ARE FOR BOYS. ANY LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS NOMINATED PER SCHOOL SHOP HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMS AND ALLOW NUMBER BINARY STUDENTS TO APPLY TO EITHER PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG HELD THAT ACCESS TO EDUCATION IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR ALL PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER. SADLY YOUNG WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN CALIFORNIA GIRL STAY ARE NOT AFFORDED COMPATIBLE CIVICS EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES AS YOUNG MEN IN CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE. EVERY YEAR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND YOUNG MEN PARTICIPATE IN BOYS STATE. VISIT SACRAMENTO AND THE STATE CAPITAL DURING THE SUMMER ON THE OTHER HAND CALIFORNIA GIRLS STATE. WITH A NINETEEN EIGHTIES ERA CAP OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS ARE ABLE TO PARTAKE IN SOME ASPECTS OF CIVIC EDUCATION BUT ARE NOT AFFORDED THE SAME ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY TO THE GOVERNMENT AS BOYS HEALTH. ASSEMBLY AND COMING TO SACRAMENTO AND VISITING THE CAPITOL ONE CANNOT DENY THAT THE PROGRAM'S PRESENCE IN SACRAMENTO AFFORDS OPPORTUNITIES THAT STUDENTS MAY NOT OTHERWISE HAVE. OTHER INEQUITIES ALSO EXIST SUCH AS APPLICATION FEES REGISTRATION FEES CAREER FAIRS AND THE LEARNING OF OUTDATED SONGS THE FOCUS MORE ON THE PARENTS OF YOUNG WOMEN THEN THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES IN LIFE. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE OFFERED THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AND SAME TYPE OF EXPOSURE TO GOVERNMENT AS YOUNG MEN. IN THE WORDS OF SALLY RIDE THE FIRST WOMAN IN SPACE YOU CANNOT BE WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE SO IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOUNG WOMEN ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED AND ARE ALSO ABLE TO VISIT THE HALLS OF POWER IN SACRAMENTO.

SENATE BILL SEVEN HUNDRED BY SENATOR DOOR ALSO AND ACTUALLY INTO EMPLOYMENT SENATOR ALSO THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS SB SEVEN HUNDRED IS A SIMPLE BILL THAT DIRECTS ET DE TO GIVE A MISCLASSIFIED POOR DRIVERS THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS THEY LEGALLY DESERVE. THIS BILL HOLDS COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE IF THEY TRY TO DEPRIVE THEIR WORKERS OUT OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND THE STATE OUT OF TAXES DURING THE PANDEMIC IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT YOU I. BENEFITS OUR LIFELINE FOR MOST WORKERS. YEAH IT IS COVERED YET AND THE AMOUNT OF CARGO IN THE PORTS DROPPED MANY PORT TRUCK DRIVERS FOUND THEMSELVES OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY APPLIED FOR BENEFITS THEY WERE INITIALLY DENIED. EVEN WORSE SOME MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS WERE DEEMED TO BE EMPLOYERS OF OTHER DRIVERS MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR UNEMPLOYED ON- MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR UNPAID YOU I. TAXES INSTEAD OF THE COMPANIES ARE PROFITING FROM THEIR HARD WORK BUT THE INITIAL LEVEL ADD DENIED BENEFITS FORCE THE CLAIMANTS TO FILE APPEALS WHICH THEY WON. BUT AFTER A LENGTHY PROCESS AS WE SEVEN HUNDRED SIMPLY DIRECTS ET DE TO COMPLY WITH TWO KEY DECISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE APPEALS BOARD THAT RIGHTFULLY FOUND DRIVERS TO BE THE EMPLOYEES AND THE TRUCKING COMPANY. NOT A FELLOW WORKER TO BE THE EMPLOYER WHO HAD TO PAY HAS TO PAY THE U. I. TAXES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY FOR DISCUSS OR DEBATE THE SIDE SENATOR. YOU MR PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY UP TO THE BILL YOU KNOW THE IS BENEFITING THE ASK I'M OVER THE CO THAT YOU THAT WE HAVE IN TWENTY. AND THERE IS ESTIMATES OF REPORTED A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FRAUD. IN THE PRISON SYSTEM ALONE THEY'RE ESTIMATING TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FRAUD AND THEN THEY'RE ALSO ESTIMATING- TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN OF BENEFITS AND PAYMENTS THAT WERE PAID OUT TO INDIVIDUALS THAT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM THEIR IDENTITY. THE UNEMPLOYMENT YOU I TRUST IS 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED AND I UNDERSTAND THE AUTHORS- WILLINGNESS AND HER DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE THAT ARE RE. ENTITLE TO EDT BENEFITS WOULD GET THOSE EDG BENEFITS BUT I THINK THIS BILL GOES DOWN A VERY SLIPPERY SLOPE AND THE REASON WHY IS. IF YOU ARE A CONTRACTOR IN YOU- CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER COMPANY OR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION A TRUCK DRIVING ORGANIZATION OR A TRUCK DRIVER AND THAT PERSON OR THAT ENTITY HIRES FIVE OTHER DRIVERS YOU ARE NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE OF THE TRUCK DRIVER. WHO SECURED THOSE SERVICES. SO TIM THE ARRAY CON REECE. FOR ALL OF THOSE EDT PAYMENTS WHEN- IN THIS SITUATION WOULD. MAKE MAJOR CONTRACTORS OR CONTRACTORS THAT SUPPLY TO SUBCONTRACTORS- IT WOULD SET PRECEDENCE FOR THEM SO THINK ABOUT THAT CALIFORNIA BUILDINGS AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES. IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BUILDING A- A LARGE SHOPPING CENTER AND THEY HIRE FIFTY SIXTY SUBCONTRACTORS THAT DO FRAMING ELECTRICAL OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THIS BILL WOULD SET PRECEDENCE THAT THE MEAT THE PRIME CONTRACTOR WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ALL OF THE EDT PAYMENTS- AND ON THERE. EDT ROLES WHEN THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE EMPLOYEES RECORDS. LIKE I SAID I UNDERSTAND WHERE THE AUTHOR IS GOING TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS GET. THESE BENEFITS THAT DESERVE THESE BENEFITS BUT TO HAVE SOMEBODY RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE BENEFITS THAT HAD NO CUSTODY CARE CONTROL OVER HIRING THOSE AND EMPLOYEES. THAT BELONG TO ANOTHER COMPANY OR ANOTHER PERSON. IS JUST NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM THERE'S ESTIMATED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN UNEMPLOYMENT AND YOU I TRUST FUND OVER DRAFT WHICH IS GOING TO FALL ON THE BACKS OF EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVER THE NEXT YEAR SO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WELL- A LOT OF IT BEING FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS THAT WERE PAID OUT. BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO BE ON THE HOOK FOR PAYING THAT BECAUSE THE U. I TRUST FUND IS 1100% EMPLOYER FUNDED. AND SO I AGAIN I AGREE WITH YOU WHAT THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO TO MAKE SURE THOSE THAT DESERVE BENEFITS. AND GET THOSE BENEFITS BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING AFTER THE WRONG INDIVIDUAL TO PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS AND. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER- DEBATE. ON THIS. NINETY NINE SENATOR ALSO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU- I JUST WONDER RESPECTFULLY. EXPLAIN AND DISAGREE THAT THIS IS NOT ABOUT SUBCONTRACTED OUT SITUATIONS THIS IS ABOUT MISS CLASSIFYING PORT TRUCK DRIVERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO CLARIFY IS TO ALLOW THEM WHO HAVE BEEN MISCLASSIFIED- NOT TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE LENGTHY DELAY OF AN APPEALS COURT WHICH THEY HAVE DONE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF CASES.

HOWEVER IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THE TENSION WAS MURDERED AT AGE TWENTY SEVEN. WHEN TWO CAUCASIAN MALES BEAT HIM TO DEATH. EIGHT DAYS BEFORE THE WEDDING. THE TWO MEN THAT KILLED TEN WERE CHRYSLER AUTO WORKERS. AND THOUGHT HE WAS JAPANESE THEY BLAME TENSION FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE JAPANESE AUTO INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH THE STATE OF MICHIGAN WHERE THIS OCCURRED HAD ALMOST FOURTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE INCARCERATED INCARCERATED IN THEIR STATES AND A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THEM WERE PEOPLE OF COLOR.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SACRAMENTO FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AS WE ALL KNOW ASIAN AMERICANS ARE FACING- AT LEAST IN OUR LIFETIMES AND UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF HATE OF ALL KINDS. AND I THINK THE STATISTICS REALLY DON'T CAPTURE. THE UBIQUITY WITH WHICH ANTI ASIAN A HATE IS OCCURRING- BECAUSE FOR EVERY CRIME THAT SUBMITTED FOR COMMITTED FOR EVERY ACTUAL ATTACK. THEIR COUNTLESS INCIDENTS WHERE ASIAN AMERICANS ARE BULLIED THEY'RE INTIMIDATED THEIR SPAT UPON- THEY'RE CALLED RACIST INSULTS NONE OF THAT IS REPORTED TO POLICE. I THINK ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO BOWLING OR TAKEN PART IN BOWLING. OR MORE COMMONLY HAVE HAVE EXPERIENCE AND WITNESS BOWLING. AND WE ALL KNOW THAT BULLYING AT ITS HEART. ONLY SUCCEEDS WHEN BYSTANDERS STAY SILENT. AND I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE FOR TOMORROW FOR ALL OF US. HAS TO BE NOT JUST ABOUT PASSING RESOLUTIONS. BUT BUT GETTING OUT THERE AND CONDEMNING. ANTI ASIAN HATE ANTI ASIAN BOWLING THERE CAN BE NO QUARTER FOR THIS RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY CAN GO OUT THERE AND SOCIALLY- IN PUBLIC COMMIT. ACTS OF RACISM SOMETIMES VERY VIOLENT. AND THEY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THE MAJORITARIAN SENTIMENT AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FEELS THAT THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. THIS I AN ACCEPTABLE SENTIMENT THE VOICE IN PUBLIC AND THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF WE THE BYSTANDERS ARE LOUD IN OUR CONDEMNATION OF THIS SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE.

SENATOR LAWYER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO ONE MEMBER OF THE LGBT CAUCUS WHO ACTUALLY MATT HARVEY MILK. A. N. I SAW HIM IN HIS THOSE EARLY RACES. HE WAS INSPIRATIONAL AND WHEN HE WAS KILLED AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS FIRED TO POLITICAL LIFE. I THOUGHT I HAD TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ABOUT BEING CLEAR ABOUT WHO I WAS. FOUR TO PURSUE THE CAREER I THOUGHT I WOULD BE THE BEST. I ACTUALLY WENT IN THE WILDERNESS FOR AWHILE. IT TOOK A YEAR OFF AND I DECIDED THAT IF I. LET PEOPLE WITH ILL INTENT MAKE A DECISION ABOUT MY FUTURE WAS THE WRONG DECISION. AND I CAME BACK IN FORTY YEARS AGO THIS NOVEMBER I WAS ELECTED TO PUBLIC OFFICE. AND AT THE TIME THERE WERE ONLY TEN. OUT LGBT PEOPLE IN OFFICE IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WHEN WE FORMED THE ELECTED OFFICIALS ASSOCIATION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THERE WERE FIFTEEN. AND YET IT WAS HIM STANDING UP AND PROVIDING THE BEACON FOR OTHER OF US TO DO WHAT TO DO THE SAME FOR OTHER PEOPLE. AND WHEN THE MOVIE MAIL CAME OUT. I WOULDN'T GO TO SEE IT FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS BECAUSE I THOUGHT WELL I KNEW EVERYBODY AROUND THE MIND OF THE PEOPLE THAT WERE PORTRAYED IN THE MOVIE. AND I KNOW HOW ENDS A I DIDN'T WORK FOR TO IT. WHEN I FINALLY. I WAS STRUCK. BY HOW FAR BEHIND THINGS WERE WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE THE FACT THAT. THERE WERE POLICE RAIDS ON ON PUBLIC VENUES AND THAT HE WOULD GO TO THEM AND TRY TO TROOPS TELL WHEN IT HAPPENED. IT WAS A REAL TRIBUTE TO JUST HOW FAR WE'VE COME AND IT WAS BECAUSE OF HIM AND SO HAVING THIS RESOLUTION AND HONORING HIM EVERY YEAR IS HONORING THAT ROLE. OF JUST MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR THE FACT THAT. WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO OFFICE. IS THERE NO MORE OUT PEOPLE IN THE MONTEREY BAY HERE YOU'RE DONE THERE WERE IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES THEN IT'S REALLY A TRIBUTE TO HIS.

ELECTION GOTTEN VERY INVOLVED IN A POLITICAL COALITION IN BERKELEY THE SPACE RIGHT ACROSS FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND WE WAS LIKE THE COALITION THAT HARVEY MILK WAS ORGANIZING IN HE WAS A BRILLIANT ORGANIZER. IT WAS MADE UP OF MANY MANY GROUPS AND THIS IS WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE ABOUT- SUPERVISOR MILK IS THAT WHILE HE WAS CLEARLY AND LOUDLY AND PROUDLY ORGANIZING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ANSWER TO SCOPE HE ALSO WAS SPEAKING FOR MANY MARGINALIZED GROUPS AND HE WORKED ON TENANTS ISSUES ANY INVOLVED IN HIS COALITION TENANTS- SENIORS- ON THE DEED IT WAS A VERY DIVERSE AND VERY- PEOPLE OF COLOR. THOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE THERE WAS- SOME TENSIONS AROUND SOME OF THE HOMOPHOBIA IN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES BUT THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT IN THE EAST BAY ARE SIMILAR COALITION HAD NOT YET INCLUDED IN OUR PLATFORM ANY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF LGBTQ ISSUES BEYOND BECAUSE OF MILK WE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT THOSE INVEST THOSE AND THEN WE REALIZED THAT MANY OF THE- OF THE OTHER ACTIVISTS IN OUR- ORGANIZATION WORK I'M GAY AND JUST HAD NOT BEEN ASKED TO US. AND SO WE THEN EMBRACE THAT IN OUR PLATFORM AND ULTIMATELY- IN FACT JUST WITHIN A FEW YEARS OF MILK'S ASSASSINATION WHEN OUR COALITION FINALLY GOT A MAJORITY ON THE BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL THE VERY FIRST VOTE WE TOOK WAS ADOPTING A DOMESTIC PARTNER BENEFITS TO GIVE- WELL IT WAS NOT MARRIAGE IT WAS THE CLOSEST WE COULD THINK OF AT THAT POINT.
