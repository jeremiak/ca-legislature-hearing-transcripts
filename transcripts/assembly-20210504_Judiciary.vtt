THEY COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.332

HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW LET BOTH

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.952
PARTIES ARE IN A BAD SITUATION

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.054
HERE- BOTH COMMERCIAL TENANTS

01:23:13.121 --> 01:23:15.824
AND THE SMALL BUSINESS THAT IS

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:17.092
A COMMERCIAL LANDLORD AND THE

01:23:17.158 --> 01:23:18.593
SMALL BUSINESS WHO IS A

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:22.564
COMMERCIAL TENANT- MY CONCERN

01:23:22.630 --> 01:23:24.532
HERE IS YOU KNOW IT IS VERY BIG

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:25.834
AND THEY'RE ALWAYS TOLD AND LAW

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:26.935
SCHOOL YOU KNOW NEVER WRITE A

01:23:27.001 --> 01:23:29.070
CONTRACT THAT SAYS TABLE

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.572
REASONABLY NEGOTIATE THE TERMS

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:33.007
OF THE NEXT CONTRACT BECAUSE

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.008
THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO DEFINE

01:23:34.075 --> 01:23:36.578
THAT- AND SO WHAT YOU OFTEN DO

01:23:36.644 --> 01:23:37.445
AS YOU SAY HEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:41.049
EITHER RE UP ON THE SAME TERMS-

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:43.017
YOU RIGHT EXACTLY THE SPECIFIC

01:23:43.084 --> 01:23:44.986
TO. WANT SO THERE'S NOT THIS

01:23:45.053 --> 01:23:48.990
PROBLEM LATER- AND SO WITH THAT

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.925
LANGUAGE IN THERE CURRENTLY AT

01:23:50.992 --> 01:23:51.860
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:52.927
PROBLEMATIC REALLY FOR BOTH

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.195
SIDES BECAUSE HOW DO YOU

01:23:54.262 --> 01:23:56.898
DETERMINE BOTH WHAT IS GOOD

01:23:56.965 --> 01:23:58.400
FAITH NEGOTIATION. AND THEN

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.634
WHAT'S A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY

01:23:59.701 --> 01:24:04.205
TO REPAY- AND I THINK THE

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.407
BETTER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:06.508
REALLY WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.176
WHICH IS YOU KNOW AT THE

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:11.880
FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAD PPP- THAT

01:24:11.946 --> 01:24:12.981

01:24:13.047 --> 01:24:14.682
OF COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS.

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.117
ESPECIALLY SMALL MOM AND POPS

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:17.085
AND THAT'S WHO I'M REALLY

01:24:17.152 --> 01:24:18.620
WORRIED ABOUT IS GOING TO GET.

01:24:18.686 --> 01:24:20.655
HURT HERE THE SOPHISTICATED.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.758
LARGE COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS ARE

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:24.325
GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:24:24.392 --> 01:24:27.662
MANAGE THIS- WITH NO THEY HAVE

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:29.397
STAFF THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF

01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:29.864
PEOPLE MANAGING THESE

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:32.367
PROPERTIES. IS A SMALL MOM AND

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:35.136
POP LANDLORDS WHO'S ALREADY

01:24:35.203 --> 01:24:37.038
BEEN OUT. THE MONEY. IT'S BEEN

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.873
STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS- THE

THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S COME

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:49.350

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.286
HELP THESE BUSINESSES. MAKE IT

WHAT THAT THAT IS AN OPTION

02:03:35.107 --> 02:03:36.642
THAT IS AN EXPENSIVE OPTION.

02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:38.177
THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT CONSUMER

02:03:38.244 --> 02:03:39.645

WITH WITH THAT SETTLEMENT- WE

02:03:43.749 --> 02:03:45.785
CAN GET EVERYBODY WE HAVE. WE

02:03:45.851 --> 02:03:47.019
HAVE HIGH INCOME EARNERS ARE

02:03:47.086 --> 02:03:49.021
HIGH DEBT LOAD WE HAVE. ONE

02:03:49.088 --> 02:03:50.756
GENERAL LOWER DEBT LOAD I THINK

02:03:50.823 --> 02:03:53.159
THAT. THE MISCONCEPTION THAT

02:03:53.225 --> 02:03:54.927
THAT WAS PRESENTED EARLIER IS

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:56.428
THAT WE YOU KNOW TARGET ELDERLY

02:03:56.495 --> 02:03:57.830
THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE AVERAGE

02:03:57.897 --> 02:03:59.031
CONSUMER THAT COMES INTO DEBT

02:03:59.098 --> 02:04:00.766
SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. IS FIFTY

02:04:00.833 --> 02:04:02.768
TWO YEARS OLD. ALSO IT SAYS YOU

02:04:02.835 --> 02:04:04.103
KNOW THAT THIS HURTS THEIR

02:04:04.170 --> 02:04:05.871
CREDIT. IT DOESN'T THAT THE

02:04:05.938 --> 02:04:06.939
AVERAGE CONSUMER THAT COMES

02:04:07.006 --> 02:04:08.607
INTO THIS PROGRAM ON AVERAGE IS

02:04:08.674 --> 02:04:10.209
A SIX TWENTY CREDIT SCORE. OR

02:04:10.276 --> 02:04:11.811
CREDIT HAS ALREADY BEEN HARD.

02:04:11.877 --> 02:04:13.445
AND SO I THINK THAT'S THERE'S A

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:14.680
LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS OUT

02:04:14.747 --> 02:04:16.148
THERE. ABOUT WHAT THAT SOMEONE

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:18.417
PROVIDERS DO. BUT AS FAR AS THE

02:04:18.484 --> 02:04:19.718
ELIMINATING FOR THOSE

02:04:19.785 --> 02:04:21.987
STRUGGLING CONSUMERS THAT- ARE

02:04:22.054 --> 02:04:24.190
IN THE LOWER INCOME. BRACKET

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:25.691
THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE LEGAL

02:04:25.758 --> 02:04:27.393
SERVICES OR THE ABILITY OR THE

02:04:27.459 --> 02:04:29.261
MONEY TO ACCESS. OF THESE

02:04:29.328 --> 02:04:30.930
ATTORNEYS- THAT COULD DO THAT

02:04:30.996 --> 02:04:32.198
SETTLEMENT FOR THEM. SO THEY

02:04:32.264 --> 02:04:33.599
HAVE TO COME TO A PROVIDER LIKE

02:04:33.666 --> 02:04:36.535
OURSELVES. THAT CAN CAN OFFER

02:04:36.602 --> 02:04:41.440
THE SERVICES- TO THOSE

02:04:41.507 --> 02:04:44.043

GALLAGHER. YEAH I THINK THE

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.475
CONCERN HERE IS THAT THIS IS A

02:06:23.542 --> 02:06:25.144
SERVICE THAT IS HELPING A LOT

02:06:25.210 --> 02:06:26.478
OF PEOPLE I MEAN WE HAVE

02:06:26.545 --> 02:06:27.613
CERTAINLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:29.148
GONE INTO DEBT EVEN BEFORE CO

02:06:29.214 --> 02:06:30.482
THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT

02:06:30.549 --> 02:06:34.086
HAPPEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC- NO

02:06:34.153 --> 02:06:34.887
BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:38.324
TRANSPIRED- AND YEAH THIS IS AN

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:40.526
INDUSTRY THAT. IS HELPING

02:06:40.592 --> 02:06:42.795
PEOPLE. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:45.431
CALLING CREDIT CARD COMPANIES

02:06:45.497 --> 02:06:47.099
DIFFERENT. GROUPS TO TRY AND

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:48.767
RESOLVE DEBT SETTLEMENT SO WE

02:06:48.834 --> 02:06:50.636
HAVE SOMEONE OUT IN THE MARKET

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:52.504
IS PROVIDING A SERVICE THAT. I

02:06:52.571 --> 02:06:53.872
THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING DOES

02:06:53.939 --> 02:06:56.008
HELP A LOT OF CONSUMERS RIGHT

02:06:56.075 --> 02:06:57.676
ARE THE BAD ACTORS OF COURSE

02:06:57.743 --> 02:07:00.412
THERE ARE. THEY ARE IN ALMOST

02:07:00.479 --> 02:07:03.148
EVERY INDUSTRY- BUT LOOK I

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:04.416
THINK HAT WHAT WHAT THE

02:07:04.483 --> 02:07:06.051
CONCERN IS THAT THIS MIGHT.

02:07:06.118 --> 02:07:07.386
HAMPER THE SERVICE BEING

02:07:07.453 --> 02:07:10.823
PROVIDED- TO CONSUMERS IN

02:07:10.889 --> 02:07:13.559
CALIFORNIA AND- NOW IT LOOKS

02:07:13.625 --> 02:07:15.094
CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF

02:07:15.160 --> 02:07:17.062
COMMERCE IS NOT A FAKE GROUP-

02:07:17.129 --> 02:07:18.530
AND THEY OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:20.966
THAT VERY REASON- IS THAT THEY

02:07:21.033 --> 02:07:22.301
WANT TO SEE THAT THAT THE

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:25.871
SERVICE IS NOT UNDULY HAMPERED-

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.840
SO. I THINK. FROM MY

02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:31.744
PERSPECTIVE MAYBE. I MEAN HAVE

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:33.145
YOU CONSIDERED PERHAPS TAKING

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.413
OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:36.582
BECAUSE TO ME THAT JUST SEEMS

02:07:36.648 --> 02:07:38.717
LIKE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO.

02:07:38.784 --> 02:07:40.786
ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OVER THIS

02:07:40.853 --> 02:07:41.887
ONE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

02:07:41.954 --> 02:07:43.389
TO DO IS SAY HEY LOOK CONSUMERS

02:07:43.455 --> 02:07:46.325
SHOULD HAVE NOTICE- THAT'S THE

02:07:46.392 --> 02:07:47.826
BASIC PREMISE OF YOUR BILLS TO

02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:49.094

CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN MAKE

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:53.332
DECISIONS- TOLD ME ABOUT THIS

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:55.234
AND EVEN GET OUT OF THAT. THIS

02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:57.169
CONTRACT IF IT IF THEY

02:07:57.236 --> 02:07:59.138
DETERMINE THAT THESE. THINGS

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:00.372

02:08:00.439 --> 02:08:02.141
RIGHT AND MAYBE YOU CAN RESPOND

EVERYTHING THEY MIGHT WITHDRAW

02:08:13.652 --> 02:08:15.821
FROM. THE FIELD AND THAT PEOPLE

02:08:15.888 --> 02:08:16.688
DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES BEING

02:08:16.755 --> 02:08:18.590
PROVIDED THAT. I THINK BY AND

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.492
LARGE A LOT OF PEOPLE. FEEL

02:08:20.559 --> 02:08:23.662
LIKE IT'S A POSITIVE THING.

02:08:23.729 --> 02:08:26.498
HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE REMARKS.

02:08:26.565 --> 02:08:30.069
MR- SO THERE'S ANOTHER ARE DOT

02:08:30.135 --> 02:08:31.136
COM COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:32.171
GOOD WORK FOR CONSUMERS AND

02:08:32.237 --> 02:08:33.072
ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDST OF

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:34.940
COVERED RECOVERY WE'D WE NEED

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:36.208
THAT THERE ARE ALSO BAD ACTORS

02:08:36.275 --> 02:08:38.043
AND ARE LEGALLY CLINICS ARE

02:08:38.110 --> 02:08:39.578
SEEING AND FEELING AND HEARING

02:08:39.645 --> 02:08:40.179
IN DEALING WITH THOSE ALL THE

02:08:40.245 --> 02:08:42.815
TIME RIGHT I ALSO ADDRESS THE

02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:45.017
OPPOSITION'S POINT THAT-

02:08:45.084 --> 02:08:45.984
THERE'S BEEN VERY FEW

02:08:46.051 --> 02:08:47.519
COMPLAINTS TO CONSUMER NOT JUST

02:08:47.586 --> 02:08:48.687
FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU.

02:08:48.754 --> 02:08:49.721
THERE'S LOW REPORTING BECAUSE

02:08:49.788 --> 02:08:51.056
THERE ACTUALLY ISN'T A SECTION

02:08:51.123 --> 02:08:52.191
FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPLAINTS

02:08:52.257 --> 02:08:53.559
RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY

02:08:53.625 --> 02:08:56.195
UNDER REPORTED IN TERMS OF

02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:57.729
REPORTS TO CFPB BUT WE'RE

02:08:57.796 --> 02:08:58.864
SEEING IT WITHIN OUR LEGAL AID

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.399
CLINICS AND SO THE GOAL OF THIS

02:09:00.466 --> 02:09:01.967
BILLS TO TIGHTEN THE

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:03.035
REGULATIONS AROUND THIS TO

02:09:03.102 --> 02:09:04.703
ENSURE THAT THE GOOD ACTORS ARE

02:09:04.770 --> 02:09:05.504
DOING THE GOOD WORK IN THE BAD

02:09:05.571 --> 02:09:06.972
ACTORS ARE BEING DEALT WITH

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:08.107
ACCORDINGLY AND PART OF BEING

02:09:08.173 --> 02:09:10.242
DEALT WITH IS PROVIDING- APPEAR

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:11.043
REYES TO THE CONSUMERS HAVE

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:13.078
SOME ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO

02:09:13.145 --> 02:09:14.246
DEAL WITH RECOURSE WHEN THEY

02:09:14.313 --> 02:09:16.315
NEEDED RIGHT AND YOU KNOW DO

02:09:16.381 --> 02:09:17.349
YOU HAVE GUYS GETTING SET UP

02:09:17.416 --> 02:09:19.084
IT'S A THREE YEAR RUN WAY IT'S

02:09:19.151 --> 02:09:19.651
GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR

02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:20.819
THEM THEY'RE DOING WITH LARGER

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:23.589
POLICY ISSUES- WE'RE VERY

02:09:23.655 --> 02:09:24.590
EXCITED ABOUT THE FBI AND THEIR

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:26.758
PURVIEW OVER THE SPACE BUT ALSO

02:09:26.825 --> 02:09:28.193
FEEL LIKE THE PIER A GIVES US

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:31.130
ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO

02:09:31.196 --> 02:09:32.297
DEAL WITH THOSE BAD ACTORS. I

02:09:32.364 --> 02:09:33.866
THINK ONE THING THE- GUYS THAT

02:09:33.932 --> 02:09:35.767
THE MORE THINGS. THERE'S ALSO A

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:36.935
FEE SHIFTING PROVISION WITHIN

02:09:37.002 --> 02:09:38.470
THE PIER RIGHT SO IF THERE'S

02:09:38.537 --> 02:09:39.938
SOME SORT OF MERITLESS LAWSUITS

02:09:40.005 --> 02:09:40.772
THE FEES COME BACK ON THE

02:09:40.839 --> 02:09:41.840
CONSUMERS IF THEIR MERITLESS

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:43.008
RIGHT SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:44.309
OF PROVISION THERE TO ADDRESS

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:45.444
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU

02:09:45.511 --> 02:09:46.945
RAISE. THAT I THINK DO PROVIDE

02:09:47.012 --> 02:09:48.814
THE KIND OF GUARD RAILS SO THAT

02:09:48.881 --> 02:09:49.715
WE WON'T HAVE THE SORT OF

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:50.949
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT'S

02:09:51.016 --> 02:09:52.184
WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO NOT TO

02:09:52.251 --> 02:09:52.985
COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO YOUR

02:09:53.051 --> 02:09:55.420
TAKEN TODAY RIGHT YEP- AND I

02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:56.155
THINK THAT'S INTERESTING I

02:09:56.221 --> 02:09:57.055
THINK WE SHOULD APPLY THAT IN

02:09:57.122 --> 02:09:59.992
OTHER. AREAS AS WELL LIKE IF

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:01.426
SOMEONE IS BRING IN A MERITLESS

02:10:01.493 --> 02:10:03.495
ACTION THAT THE ATTORNEYS FEES

02:10:03.562 --> 02:10:05.397
SHOULD. ALSO APPLY ON THE OTHER

02:10:05.464 --> 02:10:06.732
SIDE WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT MANY

02:10:06.798 --> 02:10:08.233
OTHER AREAS BUT I THINK THAT

02:10:08.300 --> 02:10:09.801
THAT THAT DOES HELP I THINK

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.570
THAT DOES HELP THE SITUATION.

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:13.071
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ALSO I

02:10:13.138 --> 02:10:13.872
MEAN WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE

02:10:13.939 --> 02:10:15.974
ANOTHER BILLS IS MAKE THE

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.376
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE

02:10:17.442 --> 02:10:19.311
ONE WHO ENFORCES WHAT WE HAVE

02:10:19.378 --> 02:10:20.846
RIGHT NOW THE I. NOW RIGHT SO

02:10:20.913 --> 02:10:21.947
THERE'S WE HAVE A NEW

02:10:22.014 --> 02:10:23.415
REGULATORY AGENCY AROUND THIS

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:25.617
BUT I THINK IT'S- YOU NOW

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:26.919
THEY'RE STILL. GET THEIR SEA

02:10:26.985 --> 02:10:28.187
LEGS RIGHT AND I THINK WE'RE

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:30.822
DEALING WITH- A SITUATION RIGHT

02:10:30.889 --> 02:10:33.525
NOW TODAY WE HAVE. MANY

02:10:33.592 --> 02:10:35.527
CONSUMERS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS

02:10:35.594 --> 02:10:37.029
DISBURSING CONSUMERS HAVE COLOR

02:10:37.095 --> 02:10:38.197
RIGHT WHO ARE DEALING WITH SOME

02:10:38.263 --> 02:10:40.199
OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE

02:10:40.265 --> 02:10:40.966
BAD ACTORS WE WANT TO BE ABLE

02:10:41.033 --> 02:10:42.634
TO GIVE THEM A TOOL AND WORKING

02:10:42.701 --> 02:10:46.038
WITH ARE LEGALLY. CLINICS WHO

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:47.673
DO SERVE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:49.174

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:52.311
WELL. OKAY NOW. NO YOU MAY NOT.

02:10:52.377 --> 02:10:53.545
I KNOW THAT YOU. CARE ABOUT

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:56.448
THAT THE QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:59.084
IN THE OUT APOLOGIZE NO WAS NOT.

OPPOSITION SO I WILL PARTY SAID

02:11:05.224 --> 02:11:06.124
I JUST IF WE DON'T WORK THROUGH

02:11:06.191 --> 02:11:07.626
SOME OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE I.

02:11:07.693 --> 02:11:08.627

02:11:08.694 --> 02:11:11.663
HAMPER- A SERVICE THAT THAT

MANY CONSUMERS TO FIND HELPFUL

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:15.167
ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE HAD MANY

02:11:15.234 --> 02:11:16.468
CONVERSATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE

02:11:16.535 --> 02:11:17.469
TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW

02:11:17.536 --> 02:11:18.737
I WORK ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.939
AS WELL AND ANOTHER BILL-

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:22.307
MARGARET AND I ARE ON SPEED

02:11:22.374 --> 02:11:22.941
DIAL WITH EACH OTHER. WE WILL

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:25.010
CONTINUE TO BE SO- BUT I ALSO

02:11:25.077 --> 02:11:25.844
DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE

02:11:25.911 --> 02:11:26.778
OVERALL GOAL OF MAKING SURE

02:11:26.845 --> 02:11:28.113
THAT WE'RE PROTECTING YOU KNOW

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:30.716
THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR

02:11:30.782 --> 02:11:31.250
CONSUMERS WHO. NEED THESE

02:11:31.316 --> 02:11:33.385
PROTECTIONS. FURTHER QUESTIONS

02:11:33.452 --> 02:11:36.588
COMMENTS. RIGHT CA NINETY SIX I

02:11:36.655 --> 02:11:39.157
DO APPRECIATE THE- YOUR BILL

02:11:39.224 --> 02:11:41.093
AND I'VE I THINK. THE RIGHT

02:11:41.159 --> 02:11:41.727
RIGHT OF ACTION IS VERY

02:11:41.793 --> 02:11:43.629
IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WHETHER

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:46.598
C. TOURNEY GENERAL OR THE- THE

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:47.899
NEW AGENCY THEY THEY'RE GONNA

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:49.568
HAVE LIMITED BANDWIDTH AND THAT

02:11:49.635 --> 02:11:50.469
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS WHAT

02:11:50.535 --> 02:11:52.671
GIVES AN AGGRIEVED PERSON IN

02:11:52.738 --> 02:11:55.040
THIS CASE. ACCESS TO JUSTICE

02:11:55.107 --> 02:11:57.342
OTHERWISE THEY CAN'T HAPPEN AND

02:11:57.409 --> 02:11:59.978
WE DID DO THE FEE SHIFTING HERE

02:12:00.045 --> 02:12:03.248
WHICH I AM. RETICENT TO DO IN

02:12:03.315 --> 02:12:04.650
MOST OF THESE CASES ESPECIALLY

02:12:04.716 --> 02:12:06.818
WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE. BECAUSE

02:12:06.885 --> 02:12:09.521
THEY'RE TOO EASILY INTIMIDATED

02:12:09.588 --> 02:12:12.658
BY THE THREAT. OF HAVING TO

02:12:12.724 --> 02:12:14.726
POTENTIALLY PAY LEGAL FEES AND

02:12:14.793 --> 02:12:15.727
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BRING A

02:12:15.794 --> 02:12:17.896
CASE UNDER THAT THREAT THAT IS

02:12:17.963 --> 02:12:20.732
A BAD ACTION IT IS. PROBABLY AN

02:12:20.799 --> 02:12:21.767
ILLEGAL ACTIONS AT LEAST

02:12:21.833 --> 02:12:23.835
UNETHICAL BUT WE KNOW THAT IT

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:25.937
HAPPENS AND SO FEE SHIFTING IS

02:12:26.004 --> 02:12:28.173
ABOUT ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT WE

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.908
HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE

02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:31.310
ARE CONSIDERING. THOSE

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:32.577
PROVISIONS BUT I APPRECIATE THE
