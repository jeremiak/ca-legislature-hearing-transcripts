YES THANK YOU MATH SCIENCE WILL SEE YOU NOW. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOVE YOUR MASS. THANK YOU A LITTLE LEVITY IN THESE TYPES OF THINGS. SO EXPLORE MORE FORMAL NOW THE DIRECT LINK HERE WE ALL WE ALL NEED A LITTLE A LITTLE LAUGH EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE. YEAH GOOD AFTERNOON ADAM CHAIRWOMAN. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY FOR THE RECORD I'M LEADERS SCIENCE I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. THIS DEPARTMENT HAS MANY CHALLENGES AND I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPLAIN HOW WE'RE HANDLING THEM. BEFORE I DO THAT THOUGH I WANT TO REMIND US OF THE CONTEXT OF OUR SITUATION. WE TEND TO COMPARE EDT PANDEMIC ISSUES TO THE GREAT RECESSION. WITHIN MY FOUR MONTHS AT THE DEPARTMENT. I SEE THAT THAT'S NOT A GOOD COMPARISON. THE GREAT RECESSION CAME UPON US RELATIVELY GRADUALLY THE PANDEMIC STRUCK SUDDENLY. WE WENT FROM THREE POINT 9% UNEMPLOYMENT 217% UNEMPLOYMENT ALMOST OVERNIGHT. AT THE HEIGHT OF THE GREAT RECESSION IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. D. D. D. EIGHT THREE MILLION CLAIMS A YEAR. AT THE OUTSET OF THE PANDEMIC WE PAID OVER THREE MILLION CLAIMS IN EIGHT WEEKS. SINCE THE END OF DECEMBER WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO MASSIVE FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGES WITH CHANGES IN BENEFITS REQUIREMENTS AND EXTENSIONS. D. D. D. IS NOW PAYING ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN CLAIMS A WEEK. SO LET'S GET TO BE THE PRIMARY FOCUS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW. GETTING CLAIMS PAID MANAGING THE CALL CENTER AND IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE COULD BE FRAUD. AFTER THE PANEL WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS REMEMBERS HALF. SINCE PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ON MARCH ELEVENTH WE HAVE ENSURED. THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO GET PAID FEDERAL BENEFITS. EVERY CALIFORNIA COLLECTING ON AN EXISTING FEDERAL. AND IT ENDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE CLAIM WAS ABLE TO CERTIFY AND RECEIVE BENEFITS SINCE MARCH. MUCH FASTER THAN OUR ORIGINAL APRIL TENTH DEADLINE. THOSE ARE REGULAR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT OFFENDED RECEIVE THE EXTRA THREE HUNDRED FEDERAL PAYMENTS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. IT UC CLAIMANTS HAVE ALSO BEEN MOVED TO THEIR NEW EXTENSIONS. CALIFORNIA IS PROCESSING NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS EACH WEEK THAT IS MORE THAN THE SECOND AND THIRD LARGEST STATES FLORIDA TEXAS BUYING. DESPITE THAT MASSIVE WORKLOAD. WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN SEVERAL AREAS BY THE END OF JANUARY WE LIQUIDATED THE ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION CLAIMS BACKLOG IDENTIFIED BY THE STRIKE TEAM IN SEPTEMBER. WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS LIKE TEXT MESSAGING NOTIFICATION AND DOCUMENTS UPLOAD FOR BETTER COMMUNICATION AND IMPROVED SERVICES. TO OUR CLIENTS. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STRIKE TEAM. AND THE STATE ARCHER. WE LAUNCHED A NEW DASHBOARD ON OUR WEBSITE SO THAT WHAT WE ARE DOING CAN BE TRANSPARENT. THE BACKLOG OF CLAIMS PENDING THE DEPARTMENT'S AFTER ACTION. LONGER THAN THREE WEEKS IS CURRENTLY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY. WHILE THIS HAS FALLEN 40% SINCE FEBRUARY HE'S CLEARLY NOT ENOUGH AND I'M SURE YOUR STAFF HAVE TOLD YOU THAT. EACH OF THE FEDERAL EXTENSIONS NECESSITY NECESSITATES A NEW EDUCATION PROGRAM. TO HELP CLAIMANTS AND CLAIM PROCESSORS I UNDERSTAND THE NEW REQUIREMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR STATE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIM YOU MUST FILE A NEW CLAIM WITH THE BENEFIT YEAR ENDS IN ORDER TO COLLECT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. BUT IF YOU'RE ON THE PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO FILE A CLAIM. I WILL TELL YOU THAT COMMUNICATING THESE KEY DIFFERENCES TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IS A CHALLENGE. MYERS DEVELOPING MATERIALS TO HELP PEOPLE DETERMINE WHAT TYPE OF CLAIM THEIR OWN AND WHAT IF ANYTHING THEY NEED TO DO NEXT. THESE PROGRAMS ARE COMPLICATED. AND WE KNOW THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO OUR CLIENTS. SO WE CONDUCT PUB PUBLIC OUT WHICH- AS A RESULT OF THAT OUTREACH THERE WERE OVER THREE AND A HALF MILLION VISITS TO OUR WEB PAGE TO CLARIFY THE END OF THE BENEFIT YOUR PROCESS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED MORE VIDEOS TO HELP OUR ASK ANY YOUTUBE VIDEO ON THE BENEFIT YEAR AND AS HAD NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VIEWS IN THE THREE WEEKS SINCE IT WAS POSTED. WE'RE ALSO CONDUCTING OUTREACH TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE. THAT HELPS CLAIMANTS ACCURATELY ANSWER THEIR CONTINUED CLAIM FORM QUESTIONS BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. ALL THESE CHANGES HAVE RESULTED IN A SEARCH YOU ARE ALL AWARE OF THAT. SO RECENTLY WE RE DIRECTED ADDITIONALLY YOU WHY STAFF TO WORK ON LEGISLATIVE REFERRALS AND WE HAVE JUST READ REDIRECTED. ADDITIONAL TRAINED STAFF FROM OTHER BRANCHES OF THE DEPARTMENT TO BACK FILL BEHIND THEM AND ASSIST WITH CLAIMS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT. BUT THEIR LITTLE COMFORT TO PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THEIR BENEFITS. FOR US LIKE YOU EVERY CLIENT MATTERS. WE CONTINUE TO PUT INTENSIVE pWHAT WE'RE DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ELIGIBLE QUICK LET'S GET PAID. AND WE'RE DOING THIS IN THE FACE OF THE COMPLICATIONS CAUSED BY IMPLEMENTING THESE WELCOME NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AREAS OF MY FOCUS HAS BEEN ON EACH CALL CENTER OPERATIONS. THE CHALLENGE WITH THE CALL CENTER IS RELATED TO THE SPEED OF PAYMENT IT'S OBVIOUS BUT WORTH MAKING EXPLICIT THE FASTER WE PAY BENEFITS THE FEWER CALLS CLAIMANTS NEED TO MAKE. MOST CALLERS ARE CALLING ABOUT EXISTING CLAIMS. AS CLAIMS GET RESOLVED THE CALL STOCK. THAT'S WHY IN JANUARY WE STARTED TO BRING ON HUNDREDS MORE PERMANENT STATE STAFF WHO CAN PROCESS CLAIMS AND GET ELIGIBLE PEOPLE PAID. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM STATES AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE UNANIMOUS IN SAYING THAT IT TAKES SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS TO FULLY TRAINED AN AGENT. WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THAT TO FOUR MONTHS THAT'S AS ABOUT THE VISION AS WE CAN MAKE IT WITH ENSURING HIGH QUALITY SKILLS. SELF HELP AND BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION IS HELPING TO REDUCE SOME CALL CENTER PRESSURE. WE MONITOR A VARIETY OF SOURCES FOR COMMON QUESTIONS AND AREAS ARE PUBLIC CONFUSION. AND WE ADDRESS THAT WITH BETTER PUBLIC INFORMATION. OVER THE LAST FIVE WEEKS THE CALL CENTER WE SEE OVER WHAT SEVENTEEN MILLION CALL ACCOUNTS OF NEARLY 50% DROP FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. STILL THE AVERAGE IS NEARLY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND CALL ATTEMPTS PER GAME AND IS MORE THAN THE CALL CENTER CAN HANDLE EVEN THOUGH IT IS RUNNING TWELVE HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. THOSE SEVENTEEN MILLION CALLS WERE MADE BY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUAL CALLERS. CALL CENTER I'M GONNA SAY THAT AGAIN THE CALLS WERE MADE BY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION INDIVIDUAL CALLERS IN OUR CALL CENTER STAFF ANSWERED ONE POINT THREE MILLION OF THOSE CALLS. WE HAVE ADDED MORE ONLINE SELF SERVICE OPTIONS TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID MAKING ANY CALL AT ALL. WE'VE ALSO IDENTIFIED TOP CLAIMING QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE RESPONSE RESPONSIVE INFORMATION WEEKLY ON EDIE'S WEBSITE IN OUR GENERAL MEDIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND EXPANDED STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH. EARLIER THIS YEAR I ADVICE THE COMMITTEE THAT MANY OF THE USEFUL FEATURES OF THE CALL CENTER HAD BECOME UNUSABLE GOOD USABLE WHEN WE DISPERSED AFTER THEIR HOMES WE ARE NOW REINSTATED SOME OF THOSE FEATURES. TWO WEEKS AGO WE LAUNCHED. WE LARGER VIRTUAL HOLD FEATURE ON A LIMITED BASIS THAT ALLOWS CALLERS TO HOLD THEIR PLACE IN LINE AND HAVE THE DEPARTMENT CALLED THEM BACK. THE EXPANSION OF THIS FEATURE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY JAIL. IN THIS LIMITED TIME WE'VE HAD- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REACH FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN PEOPLE ARE THERE SEEMED TO BE HAVING SOME SUCCESS WITH US SO. WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO ACCELERATE. WE'RE INVESTING MILLION DOLLARS IN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER SERVICES FOR OUR CALL CENTER TO SERVE CLAIMANTS IN POTENTIALLY HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES. WE HAVE DEDICATED PHONE LINES IN ENGLISH SPANISH CANTONESE MANDARIN AND VIETNAMESE. ONE OF OUR TOP GOALS IS TO CREATE A MULTILINGUAL TRANSLATION AND INTERPRETER SERVICE TO HELP LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT CLAIMANTS ACCESS THEIR PROGRAMS THIS WILL INCLUDE A MULTILINGUAL ACCESS PROGRAM AND OTHER NEW LDP SERVICES. WE HAVE TO REACH MORE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. AND MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH SPECIALIZED LOCAL AND IN LANGUAGE MEDIA. FINALLY WE RECOGNIZE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS DO NOT HAVE EITHER THE ACCESS OR THE ABILITY TO USE THE INTERNET AND WE CONTINUE TO TALK TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THESE PEOPLE REGULARLY FOR BETTER WAYS TO REACH. TALK ABOUT PRODUCT PER SECOND. LAST YEAR WE TOOK OUR STEPS TO ENHANCE OUR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE UNPRECEDENTED IMPOSTOR FRAUD SEEN HERE AND NATIONWIDE. THE CRIMINAL SCHEMES MOVED TO OTHER STATES WITH WEAK WEAKER FRAUD FILTERS WHEN WE INITIATED OUR FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION. SYSTEMS WHAT WE ARE STILL RECEIVING FRAUDULENT FORMS THREE HUNDRED UNIFICATION OF VERIFICATION AND ROBUST FRAUD FILTERS TO CHECK CLIMATE INFORMATION AGAINST DATABASES FROM THOMSON REUTERS TO PROTECT AGAINST THIS CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THERE ARE NO EFFORTS COULD TRIED SUCH A STRONGER IDENTIFICATION WITH ID ME THAT THEY'VE ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF REVIEW. THIS NO MEASURE HAS STOPPED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL FRAUD. HOWEVER WE HAVE NOT YET STRUCK THE BALANCE WE NEED BETWEEN SECURITY AND SPEED. WE ARE NOTIFYING IN OUR FRAUD FILTERS SO THAT ALLEGED TO MAKE CLAIMANTS ARE NOT NOT NECESSARILY CAUGHT UP OR DELAYED BECAUSE OF OUR FRAUD PREVENTION EFFORTS. JUST TO MAKE IT THAT UP 235% OF CLAIMS LAST YEAR OR FRAUDULENT. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE INTEND TO MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO HOLD THOSE CRIMINALS ACCOUNTABLE. OUR INVESTIGATION UNIT CONTINUES TO PROVIDE VALUABLE LEADS AND EVIDENCE TO LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS. WE ARE SEEING A RISE IN THE TIDE OF SEARCH WARRANTS ARRESTS PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS. JUST LAST WEEK THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ANNOUNCED THAT STATE TASK FORCE ON PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE FRAUD. HAS LED TO THE ARREST OF SIXTY EIGHT SUSPECTS AND OPENED ONE THOUSAND AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THIS WILL CONTINUE TO RAMP UP. THE BILL STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SHARE DATA WITH OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO HELP CATCH MULTISTATE PROCTOR'S. WE ARE PROSPERITY DAY GET AGAINST LAW ENFORCEMENT RECORDS SUSPECTING MULTIPLE CLAIMS FROM A SINGLE ADDRESS FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE STATE. ALL PROP OFF FRONT AND PREVENTION EFFORTS IN EDT. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO HELPING VICTIMS WITH OUR OF THE IDENTITY FRAUD WE KNOW CRIMINALS USED ARE REAL BUT STILL STOLEN IDENTITIES FROM THE DARK WEB FILE FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. IN RESPONSE WE'RE CONTINUALLY REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC ON HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT. WE ALSO HELP PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED A TEN NINETY NINE G. SHOWING UNEMPLOYMENT UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE. HOWEVER AS I'VE SAID ARE FRAUD FILTERS KEVIN WOODLEY SWEPT UP LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS SO WE STILL HAVE YES WE WERE STILL IN A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE TO REASSESS THOSE FILTERS. IN CLOSING ARE. THE FOCUS OF THE D. D. SINCE THE PANDEMIC HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO TRY TO DO WHAT IS BEST FOR CLAIMANTS. SOMETIMES WE DO IT WELL. SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT AS SUCCESSFUL. DURING THE WORST YEAR OF THE GREAT RECESSION AS I SAID THERE ARE THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THERE HAVE BEEN TWENTY TWO MILLION CLAIMS FILED IN THIS PANDEMIC. A VALUE OF WORK HAS BEEN STAGGERING. DURING THE SAME TIME THIS WAS HAPPENING. WE WERE MOVING THE ENTIRE WORK FORCE TO REMOTE TO REDUCE THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS MASS HIRING REDIRECTING WORKERS FROM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT BORROWING WORKERS FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS CONTINUING TO STAFF UP IN THE USE OF ANDERS HAVE ALL BEEN A PART OF AN EFFORT TO RESPOND TO THE HISTORIC DEMAND FOR BENEFITS DURING AN UNPRECEDENTED NATIONAL EMERGENCY. DESPITE THOSE DISRUPTIONS WE MANAGED TO PAY OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS. WE HAVE HANDLED MAJOR PROBLEMS ELIMINATED THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION BACKLOG OF CLAIMS OPEN IN THE CALL CENTER TO RUN TWELVE HOURS A DAY. SEVEN DAYS A WEEK HIRING HUNDREDS. OF NEW STATE WORKERS AND LAUNCHING NEW IDENTIFICATION VERIFICATION. TO PREVENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STATE PRIDE. ALSO WE ARE NOW IN THE PROCESS. REDESIGNING A NEW BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE BEST INFORMATION FROM WHAT WE DID BEFORE WITH THE BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECTS THE LESSONS THAT WE AND OTHER STATES LEARNED DURING THE PANDEMIC AND NEW SOFTWARE THAT HAS BECOME AVAILABLE SINCE WE STARTED THE PROJECT. THERE ARE NEW CHALLENGES. PROCESSING THE CLAIMS AS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REACHED THE END OF YOUR RECEIVING BENEFITS INTEGRATING VERIFICATION PROCEDURES REDUCING THE BACKLOG OF A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CLAIMS AND WORKERS PROSECUTORS TO HOLD SOPHISTICATED FRAUDSTERS LAST YEAR ACCOUNTABLE. WE HAVE A SOLID ROADMAP FROM STRIKE JAMES AND THE AUDITOR AND WE ARE PUTTING THOSE CHANGES IN PLACE. I WANT TO THANK LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE IN SO MANY WAYS CONSISTENT CONSISTENTLY OFFERED ME AND THE DEPARTMENT HELP AND ADVICE. AND TO THEIR STAFF. WHO HAVE SERVED OUR CLAIMANTS WHO ARE THEIR CONSTITUENTS. MORE HELP IS COMING. FILING MANY THANKS TO OUR MAGNIFICENT STAFF HAVE STEPPED UP FROM OTHER PARTS OF EDT THE RESPONSE. TO THE EMERGENCY I AM HOPING THAT TODAY WE ENGAGE IN A PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE THAT WILL HELP TO ACCELERATE OUR PROCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SCIENCE WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM THE L. A. O. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP TO COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MR ALUM. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAD ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WORK HERE- AS ALWAYS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE THAT HAVE ON THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM- BEYOND DIRECTOR SENTENCES OUT. RESET UPDATE AND NOT HAPPY TO GET BACK AS WELL TO THE- STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE WITH ANY LONGER TERM REQUESTS- THAT REQUIRE A LITTLE MORE DATA WORKER COMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENT. AS ALWAYS HERE TO ASSIST THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MESS AROUND IS FOR HIM. HI BETTER TOP DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORTER MIKE MINUTES CAN'T BE HERE TODAY AND I'M THINKING I'M IN LABOUR ASSIGNMENT AT THIS TIME- FINANCE HAS NOTHING TO ADD BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU GUYS HAVE. AS A MAINTENANCE ITEM. THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU THEN LET'S GO TO OUR COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS BUT LET ME TAKE A MOMENT PRIVILEGE AND JUST ASK- IT DIRECTOR SIGNS. YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE TAKING B. YOU WERE GOING TO CREATE A FRAUD UNIT WHEN WILL THAT BE. A ENACTED. ACTUALLY WE ALREADY HAVE CREATED IT. WHEN WAS IT CREATED IT'S CREATED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. OKAY AND HOW MANY HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THAT PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT. IT IS A COMBINATION OF THE IT'S IT WE'RE DOING IT LIKE A NETWORK WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM EVERYONE OF THE BRANCHES AND THEY'RE MEETING REGULARLY. WE HAVE NOT CREATED A SEPARATE UNIT AS OF YET. WE ARE WORKING ARE TO COLLABORATE ACROSS ALL OF THE BRANCHES. OKAY I GUESS WE'D JUST LIKE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF WHAT DOES THIS THE POTENTIAL UNIT LOOK LIKE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE BEHIND IT AND WHAT IS IT. HOW ARE YOU MEASURING YOUR LEVELS OF FRAUD IN TERMS OF FOLKS THAT ARE ALSO RECEIVING FRAUD NOTIFICATIONS AT HOME OF NOT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS IN COLLABORATION WITH. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT YOU NOW HAVE LOOKING AT WHAT IS DETERMINED OF THE FRAUD. WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH MORE INFORMATION ON THAT. OKAY GREAT- ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- HAS THERE BEEN OR WHY HAZARD WHY HAS A PROGRESS RECENTLY SLOW DOWN ON THE TWENTY ONE DAY BACKLOG ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FALLING CASELOAD NUMBERS. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. PART OF IT IS DUE TO THE SURGE HAVING TO DO WITH THE NEW PROGRAMS THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. OKAY WHEN DO YOU SO THAT SO. REMEMBER OUR AND IF YOU JUST HAPPEN IT DOES CDSS WHEN I READ IT WELL WE HAD CASELOADS WHAT HAPPENS IS A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COME OFF IN A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COME ON. SO A LOT OF THIS LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING ON ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE ASKING QUESTIONS. ABOUT THESE NEW FEDERAL EXTENSIONS. SO ARE YOU YOU SEEN IT IN YOUR OFFICE AS WELL I'M SURE. PEOPLE WITH NO PEOPLE WITH QUESTIONS. MORE THERE'S THERE SEEMS TO BE FROM JUST CONVERSATIONS WITH OF FELLOW LEGISLATORS THAT THEY'RE JUST EVEN WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CALL CENTER IT'S STILL VERY DIFFICULT FOR. CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO REACH SOMEONE OVER THE PHONE OR HAVE THEIR EMAILS BE RETURNED IN A TIMELY MANNER OR HAVE ANY TYPE OF CORRESPONDENCE THAT'S TIMELY SO I'M JUST CURIOUS- IN TERMS OF THE BACKLOG. OUT WHY THERE'S A SLOW DOWN WHEN THERE'S ALSO AN INCREASE OF STAFF AND LESS CASE CASE NUMBERS AND AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION IS WAS THERE. THIS THIS PROBLEM EXIST PRIOR THAT EDIE DEAN ALSO HAVE THIS SAME SITUATION BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THERE IS A PERCENTAGE OF BACKLOG- A STANDARD. THAT IS ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. I THINK THE BACKLOG ESTABLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS 10% THAT IS CONSIDERED TO BE BEYOND THAT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN THE PAST. EDG HAD A PERCENTAGE OF 8% GENERALLY. SO BEFORE THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS TYPE OF A SITUATION WHERE SO MANY PEOPLE WERE SUDDENLY UNEMPLOYED AND ARE NOT WEEK COMING BACK AGAIN FOR BENEFITS BUT I'D BE GLAD TO HAVE EITHER ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES- GIVE BETTER DETAIL ON THAT. CHAVEZ CAROL WILLIAMS I CAN ATTEMPT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION YOU CONCERNED- BUT YOU'RE AWARE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE REINSTATED DOING DETERMINATION INTERVIEWS OF THE CLAIM IT HAS AN ELIGIBILITY ISSUE. SO THIS AGAIN DOING THOSE DETERMINATION INTERVIEWS PREDATES- THE PANDEMIC WE WEREN'T DOING THEM DURING THE PANDEMIC NOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN REINSTITUTED. IT IS SLOWER BECAUSE WE ARE FINDING THAT WE NEED TO RETRIEVE MORE INFORMATION FROM CLIENTS FOR EXAMPLE CLIMATE STATE THAT THEY WERE FIRED OR THEY QUIT- IT REQUIRES EDT TO MANUALLY REVIEW THE CLAIM BEFORE DETERMINING IF THAT CLAIM IS ELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS AND THAT IS TAKING QUITE A BIT TIME- FOR THAT RESONATOR DOES THAT MAKE THEM. GEN VENTURA WELL I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT IS YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK IF YOU GO TO THE IF YOU LOOK AT. THE BACKLOG AT LEAST FOR THE TWENTY ONE DAYS ON YOUR WEBSITE AND THEN YOU THINK ABOUT AND YOU CORRELATE THAT WITH THE FALLING CASELOAD NUMBERS. AND INCREASES TO THE CALL CENTER AND ADDITIONAL HELP I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IMPROVING. IT IS S. B. IT IS DEFINITELY A SPEED ISSUE WHEN WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THE ACCOUNTS INDIVIDUALLY WE CANNOT DO IT- APPLYING MANUAL- FOR AN AUTOMATED SOLUTION TO THEM. IT'S THE IT IT IS THE TIME AND THAT TIME OF A LAPSING IS WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS WHAT THE CLAIMS ARE EXPERIENCING IT'S WHY THINGS ARE FEELING LIKE. WHAT THINGS ARE IMPROVING THINGS ARE ALSO SLOWER MOTION REMEMBER THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION IN THE INTERVIEWS WERE NOT HAPPENING- PRIOR TO THIS CALENDAR YEAR. HOPE THAT HELPS UNDERSTAND IT THE VARIOUS WITH EDT IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE THING- YOU KNOW THAT THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED IN HER- OPENING ABOUT THE BENEFIT YEAR ENDING THAT'S ALSO CAUSING AS AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED- SOME CONFUSION AND SOME- ADDITIONAL CALLS INTO THE CALL CENTERED BECAUSE- IF IT'S- IT IS CONFUSING AS SHE MENTIONED WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REAPPLY OR NOT- AND THAT IS AN ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD. THANK YOU I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I ALSO WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO OUR MY COLLEAGUES HERE AND IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR BUDGET CHAIRMAN SITTING. I JUST GOT A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS. WERE WERE NOTICING A SURGE IN CALLS FROM THE- FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THEIR ANNUAL RENEWAL FONG AND WE'VE BEEN GETTING- A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF- COMPLAINTS AGAIN AS OUR AS OUR CHAIR. A LITTLE TOO ABOUT NOT BE ABLE TO GET A HOLD OF ANYBODY OR NOT BILL TO RESOLVE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY RENEWING- THERE ARE CLAIMS HAVE YOU ALSO BEEN I ASSUME YOU'VE ALSO BEEN SEEING THIS AND JUST CURIOUS. ON HOW YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE PROBLEM YES SIR- WE MOST CERTAINLY HAVE AND IT'S THE REASON THAT WE'RE GOING TO. WHERE WE'RE EXPLORING AND- PURSUING THIS VIRTUAL A VIRTUAL HOLD CALL SYSTEM WHAT'S HAPPENING IS A COMBINATION OF PEOPLE THAT SOMETIMES DOESN'T OCCUR TO PEOPLE THAT WHILE YOU'RE WAITING IF YOU HANG UP YOU LOSE YOUR- HERE'S WHERE YOU ARE YOU'RE NOT WHERE YOU ARE IN LINE WHERE YOU ARE IN THE QUEUE. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS PEOPLE HANG UP WHEN THEY CALL AGAIN. AND I'M SURE YOU'RE STEP HAS HEARD JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD THIS PEOPLE WILL CALL TWENTY TIMES THIRTY TIMES DURING THE DAY EACH TIME GETTING IN A NEW PLACE IN THE QUEUE. ARE WE ARE ALSO DISCOVERING THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF AN AUTOMATED COLLEEN IT'S HAPPENING NOW. SOME SORT OF A NATIONAL SYSTEM WHERE YOU CAN PAY SOMEBODY I THINK TWENTY DOLLARS AND- THEY'LL KEEP CALLING UNTIL THEY GET SOMEBODY. SO YOU HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF CALLING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET IN YOUR HEART AND YOUR STAFF IS HURTING. WE'RE HOPING THAT BY GOING TO THIS VIRTUAL HOLD WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS PEOPLE WILL KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A PLACE IN LINE. AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO CALL THEM BACK SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THESE TEN OR FIFTEEN OR TWENTY CALLS EVERY DAY. WE'VE ALSO STRENGTHENED WHAT WE HAVE ON THE WEBSITE NOW ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO ASK THE MEMBERS- YOU KNOW ACT I KNOW THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEBSITE PEOPLE REPORTED TO ME THAT THE WEBSITE WAS NOT. AS USEFUL AS IT COULD BE IT IS MUCH BETTER NOW AND WE ARE REALLY ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO DO SELF SERVICE. IS THAT WHAT YOU KNOW THAT WILL REDUCE THE CALLS. WILL REDUCE PEOPLE HAVING TO SIT ON THE AYE AYE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT- AFTER HAPPEN ARE WAITING ON THE LINE. HERE STARTS TO FALL OUT. SO I CAN COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE TO WAIT FOR HOURS. SO THIS IS A SYSTEM WILL HAVE BEEN BY JUNE. OKAY OKAY THAT. ADOPTING OUR CHALLENGES AS WE START TO OPEN UP. OUR DISTRICT STAFF WHO OF MANY OF US ARE MOST OF US HAVE ALMOST PRIMARILY BEEN- FIELDING EDT CALLS WAS TRYING TO GET THIS INFLUX OF CALLS BUT WE ALSO WE ALSO NEED TO START DIRECTING OUR STAFF TO. OTHER KINDS OF WORK SO WE- WE CAN'T DO THAT BUT WE'RE IN THE SITUATION WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE NOT ADDRESS BECAUSE THIS CAN GET A HOLD OF YOU. I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND IT'S THE REASON THAT I HAVE ADDED ANOTHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE. TO WORK THE LEGISLATIVE CASTLE. AND THAT JUST THIS LAST WEEK ACT RIGHT HERE YOU I YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE PEOPLE CALL ME A LEGISLATORS CALL ME. TEXT ME THEY LET ME KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE SURGE HAD REACHED OUT THE DOOR LEGISLATIVE OFFICERS I'VE HEARD DARK DISTRICTS DOWN YOU KNOW THEY- THEY'RE JUST- IF THIS IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO EVERYBODY SO WE'VE PUT WE CAN ADDITION TO THE SIXTY LEADERS AS WE HAVE WE HAVE ALSO PUT ANOTHER HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE. BACK TO WORK ON THE CASE WHICH IS AT THE THIRD THANK YOU SUCH A FUN AFTER THAT APPRECIATE DR THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT BETWEEN NOW AND pIMPROVEMENT HAPPENS. THANK YOU PROPERLY HAD ENOUGH STAFF IN THE INTERIM TO DEAL WITH THE INFLUX OF CALLS WE JUST CAN'T. WE FRANKLY WE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT IS JUST BE REMANDED STAND BECOME TO MY THINK IT'S FOR THE BECOME. TOO MUCH FOR ALL OF OUR OUR DISTRICT STAFF. SO THANK YOU. AND AS A AS A FOLLOW UP SIGNS HOW QUICK WILL LEGISLATIVE STAFF ESPECIALLY OUR DISTRICT STAFF BE ABLE TO TRANSFER. THOSE CASE FILES ARE CASELOADS TO EURO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY A FULL TIME STAFF AT EDT. THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY STAFF WAS STARTED THIS WEEK. WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW FAST WE CAN YOU KNOW WE CAN KEEP YOU ABREAST AND YOUR FOR YOUR STAFF FOR KEEPING ABREAST OF HOW IT'S MAKING AN IMPACT- SO YOU KNOW WE STARTED THIS WEEK ARE YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO BE CHECKING ON IT EVERY WEEK WE'LL SEE IF IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AND IF IT. WE NEED TO DO MORE WITH. THIS IS KEVIN KNOWLEDGE OUT BUT DECIDED DIRECTOR FOR YOU TO DEAL. ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE HERE SO- WE CREATED A SYSTEM LAST YEAR BE A SALES FORCE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICES AND HAVING THEM INPUT CASES INTO THAT IN WHICH THE EDT STAFF WORKS. YOUR OFFICE HOLDER OFFICES HAVE BEEN GREAT PARTNERS ARE NOT PROCESS CONTINUING TO PUT THOSE CASES IN THAT SYSTEM TO HAVE THE STAFF WORK AT. THIS A HUNDRED TWENTY STAFF OF THE DIRECTORS MENTIONED WILL BE WORKING DIRECTLY ON THOSE MORE COMPLEX CASES BETTER BUT YOUR STAFF FOR PUTTING IN THE SYSTEM SO THERE'S- ALREADY A SYSTEM SET UP TO TRANSFER THAT. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE ADDING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS- THOSE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN ENCROACHED INTO THE SYSTEM. SO JUST WANT ONE LAST FOLLOW UP ON. I NOTICE WITH YOUR BACKLOG OBVIOUSLY YOU'VE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS SINCE FEBRUARY BUT WITH THE BACKLOG- YOU HAD A LOW OF APRIL TENTH AND NOW STARTED TO CREEP BACK UP. ON OUR DID YOU ANTICIPATE CONTINUED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THAT BACKLOG BACK DOWN OR DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO KEEP GOING. GOING UP I THINK THAT'S AN OVERALL CONCERN. WHAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- I THINK I'LL ALECTRA ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES ANSWER THAT MIGHT MY SENSE IS THAT. WITH THESE ADDITIONAL HANDS WORKING THE CASES THAT WE WILL BUT WE DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY NEW PROGRAMS ARE AND SO IT'S REALLY IN MY MIND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AN IMPACT BUT A LECTURE CAL STATE. ANYTHING BUT THAT YEAH I CAROL WILLIAMS- EDT. I THINK THE RECTOR SIZE IS DIRECTLY ON POINT WE ARE WATCHING THESE NUMBERS ON A AND AGAIN THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT ANY INCREMENTAL INCREASE AND THAT IS A CONCERN TO US WE'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO ROOT CAUSE EVERY SINGLE WEEK WHAT. WHAT THE INCREASES WHAT CAN WE DO SO AT JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE- THE BENEFIT YEAR ENDING WHICH IS HAS BEEN A HUGE GLOBAL CONCERN THE CLAIMANTS SOMEWHERE SURPRISE THEY WERE NOT AWARE THAT LITERALLY THEIRCLAIM MS IN TWELVE MONTHS- WELL THIS INFORMATION IS CERTAINLY AVAILABLE ONLINE WE ARE LOOKING TO JUST PUSH TAX MESSAGES SO THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE. ABSOLUTELY KNOWS A LITTLE BIT OF TAXING MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY BE GOING INTO THEIR MESSAGING ACCOUNT- BUT THEY KNOW YOU KNOW THEIR CLAIMS OR IN SOME TYPE OF PENDING STATUS IT HASN'T MOVED IN THIS IS LITERALLY WHAT THE BULK OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THERE YEAR HAS ENDED AND BAIT WE- THE RECOMMENDATION FROM EITHER THE IS THAT THEY INITIATE- FILING A NEW CLAIM WE CERTAINLY ARE ALSO. LOOKING AT ALL THESE CLAIMS THAT HAVE EXPIRED AND- WE'RE IN MICHIGAN INITIATING THEM ON THE BEHALF OF CLAIMANTS BUT THERE ARE SO MANY IN FRONT OF US IT'S SO MUCH FASTER IF THE CLAIMANT DOESN'T SO THAT'S THE TEXT MESSAGE THAT'S GOING OUT MY SAY THOSE TO SHARE- WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AHEAD BE PROACTIVE WITH MESSAGING SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THESE BACKLOG NUMBERS DOWN FOR THOSE THAT CAN BE RESOLVED. SO THAT OUR STAFF COULD REALLY JUST WORK THE MOST DIFFICULT COMPLICATED. CASES AND- AND THOUGHT THAT SHE THAT FOLKS RECEIVE ACCLAIM FOR. THANK CAN'T MISS CHIU. THANK YOU OUT WHEN YOU START A MATTER DIRECTOR BY JUST RECOGNIZING- WE ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT YOUR JOB IS AND- I WANTED TO SAY I KNOW HOW HARD YOUR TEAM HAS BEEN WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT WORK I KNOW EVERYONE IS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BEEN SO DIFFICULT- I DO WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME THE QUESTIONS OF OUR CHAIR OF BOTH OUR SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR AND OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR. ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO SEE MANY OF THE-EXACT SAME UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN FLAGGING FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR AS WELL AS SIMILAR WAIT TIMES- JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT THIS PAST WEEKEND MY DISTRICT OFFICE RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED ENQUIRIES FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO NEED HELP WITH THEIR CASES THIS MONTH MY OFFICE HAS BEEN RECEIVING. COUNTLESS CALLS FROM DESPERATE CONSTITUENTS MANY OF WHOM WERE IN TEARS SOME OF WHOM ARE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS AND EVEN SOME WHO HAVE THREATENED SUICIDE AND WE KNOW THIS IS JUST A COMPLETELY UNTENABLE SITUATION FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE FOR DISTRICT STAFF SO ON THIS ISSUE OF HOW IS IT THAT DESPITE ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS MADE IN THE INCREASE STAFFING WE ARE STILL SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE BACKLOG IT SEEMS TO US THAT. WE'RE NOT JUST TREADING WATER BUT WORKS FOR UNDERWATER AGAIN AND I'M WONDERING DOES IT HAVE TO DO WITH IT DOT MAYBE ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT ANY ISSUES THERE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE CAPACITY ISSUES AROUND THAT SYSTEM- WE ALSO ARE HEARING THAT TRAINING OF STAFF HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT- WOULD JUST WHAT WHAT ARE THE TOP LEVEL THINGS THAT YOU FEEL ARE- THE BOTTLENECKS TO BEING ABLE TO DRESS THE SITUATION AND I HATE TO ASK THIS QUESTION BUT I NEED TO. WHICH IS DO YOU IT IS OUR TIME FRAME FOR WHEN YOU THINK THESE NUMBERS WILL WILL COME DOWN ONES. ONE IS THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. THE TRUTH I THINK THAT WITH TO BEGIN TO SEE LIGHT AT THE END OF. THE TUNNEL PROBABLY AT THE END OF JUNE. R. BUT I WANT TO REITERATE A LARGE PART OF THE SEARCH HAS COME FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIT THEIR BENEFIT YEAR AND. AND I'LL JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE SO YOU KNOW OF. NOBODY CAME UP TO ME AND ASKED ME ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WERE THEY GONNA DO THEY GOT THEY GOT THEIR LAST CHECK THEY WERE WAITING FOR A CHECK. THE CHECK ACTUALLY SAID ON IT. WHAT WAS HAPPENING. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE ARE STRESSED OUT. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY PAY ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING. SO I COMPLETELY UNDERSTOOD WHY THE GENTLEMAN WAS ASKED ME GOOD SO I SAID IF YOU HAVE A FEW HAVE. ALREADY CHECKED YOUR EMAIL BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE ON YOUR CHECK. LATER I SILENCE YES IT WAS ON MY CHECK I FIGURED IT OUT- BUT YOU KNOW. THE THIS GUY WAS WAS PRETTY WELL EDUCATED. WE HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS PROBLEMS WHEN PEOPLE ARE NOT- SAVVY ABOUT. HOW TO DEAL WITH GOVERNMENT AND HAVE A LOOK AT HOW TO WORK WITH FORMS ARE OR THEY THEY JUST I'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO WHO WROTE IT SAID. BOB I GOT A MESSAGE FROM EDT THAT SAYS I DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING AND I WILL BE PAID AND MY BACK PAYMENT WILL BE MADE TO ME. IN WICKS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN. EIGHT WHAT ARE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING PEOPLE AREN'T A LOT OF STRESS RIGHT NOW SO WE'RE DEALING WITH IT'S HARD TO GET IN WITH PEOPLE SOMETIMES ARE OUT FOR THEIR BEST FOR THEIR OWN BEST INEREST I THINK THAT THE SURGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING. WHY WHY WHY DIDN'T MY BENEFIT YEAR AND ARE WHY DO I HAVE TO CERTIFY EVERY TWO WEEKS I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CERTIFY IT SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC USER THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. SO YOU KNOW WITH WITH THESE NEW THINGS THAT WERE PUT WE'VE ALSO I DIDN'T MENTION. WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT AREAS WHERE WE CAN AUTOMATE. OUR SOME OF OUR MANUAL PROCESSES AND WE'VE DONE SOME OF THAT AS WELL. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THERE ARE THERE INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS. YEAH EDT RIGHT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT I THINK BY THE SUMMER. THAT'S AND I UNDERSTAND LISTEN I UNDERSTAND HOW DESPERATE PEOPLE ARE. I GET THESE LETTERS I GET THESE EMAILS. MYSELF DIRECTLY. SO ARE THERE ISN'T A DAY THAT THAT GOES BY WITHOUT THIS BEING RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT TO MY FACE. THE DIFFICULTY THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING. AND I GUARANTEE YOU EVERYBODY WHO WORKS ON THESE CLAIMS EDT IS VERY VERY AWARE OF THAT. ARE STILL VOLUNTEERING TO WORK THE WEEKENDS AND IN THE EVENINGS TO GET THESE KIND OF STUCK. AND WE WILL HAVE A GREATER. FORECASTERS TUB QUESTION A CLARIFICATION QUESTION ON THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG- WHEN YOU GO TO THE MAIN EDT- DATA PAGE IT SAYS THE BACKLOG OF CLAIMS PAST TWENTY ONE DAYS PENDING EDT ACTION IS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG AS WE- TYPICALLY UNDERSTAND IT WHICH INCLUDES SAY CLOSE TO MILLION FOLKS WERE BACKLOGGED BECAUSE THEY'RE WAITING CERTIFICATION FROM THE CLAIMANT AND OTHERS THAT THE REAL NUMBER THE BACKLOG AS WE UNDERSTAND IT IS CLOSER TO ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. WONDERING IF YOU COULD START TALKING ABOUT THAT AND WONDER IF I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SEE THAT MORE CLEARLY BECAUSE WE AS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO DIG AROUND TO REALLY. UNDERSTAND THAT YEAH I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM THERE THE REASON THAT YOU'RE SEEING THE- THE STATISTICS OF THE WAY THEY ARE NOW WAS THAT THE OTHER STATISTIC WHEN THEY WERE MERGED TOGETHER WAS MISLEADING. WHAT HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT CERTIFIED. FOR THEIR WEEKS. WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEM. TO REMIND THEM TO URGE THEM TO CERTIFY I COULD NOT MAKE SOMEBODY CERTIFY. IF I COULD JUST- INSERT HERE. A LARGE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS HAVE FOUND EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS THE BEST RESULT BUT THEY WALK AWAY FROM THE CLIMB BUT WE REFLECT THEIR CLAIMS UP WITH FULL TRANSPARENCY ON OUR DASHBOARD IN ON OUR SYSTEM SO THAT WE HAVE THE FULL BOUNTY OF THE WORK INVOLVED BUT IT TAKES THIRTY DAYS FOR THOSE TO ROLL OFF BUT IT'S A CONSTANT ROLE. THANK YOU. FIVE AB I APPRECIATE THAT I KNOW YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE CERTAINLY IN THAT CATEGORY SAY MILLION FOLKS THAT HAVE NOT TO- CERTIFIED THERE ARE DEFINITELY CONSTITUENTS WHO. ARE CONFUSED WERE INTERACTING WITH THEM OR TRY TO GET THEM TO BUT THEY STILL IN OUR MINDS COUNTED SPOKES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE BACKLOG AND I AND I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND THAT- ONE THE TOTAL ASSET QUESTIONS AROUND LANGUAGE ACCESS- YOU KNOW. LANGUAGE ACCESS IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR ME AND MANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. IT'S AN ISSUE WE'VE WE'VE DISCUSSED- IT'S EMBODIED IN MY AB FOUR ONE.

WE WILL HAVE TRANSLATED A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT FORMS ONCE THEIR CLAIM ISSUES ALL THE TIME.

TRYING TO ADDRESSES SO- JUST AGAIN APPRECIATE DAT PROJECT WORK ON THIS MATTER JEFF THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT AND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER COOPER- THANK YOU I'M- ARE BIG ISSUES THAT EVERY TIME AN EXTENSION OF BENEFITS OCCUR. WHICH IS EVERY TWENTY SIX WEEKS. OUR OFFICE GETS INUNDATED WITH THE SAME CONSTITUENTS. ASKING FOR HELP. WHICH IS ULTIMATELY OPENING THEIR CASES. BECAUSE THE DELAY OF BENEFITS WHICH EDIE TOLD US IS ANYWHERE BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX WEEKS. WE ALSO- HAVE MARKETED FROM THE EDT STAFF IS STILL TOYING OUR CONSTITUENTS TO CALL. US TO RESOLVE THEIR CASES. AND RIGHT NOW I FEEL RESURGENT ABOUT FIFTY SIXTY CASES PER FIELD REP. SOME WHAT'S IT TAKING SO LONG STILL WITH EXTENSION. WE KNOW CAN MOST OF THE PROGRAMS WE WERE ABLE TO. GOOD PEOPLE THEIR BENEFITS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION- I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE CASES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER- WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT TYPE OF- WITH THOSE TYPE OF STATISTICS BELIEVE ME. ANDEAVOR WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS TOUR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD HOPE WHAT HAPPENED I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE WEBSITE AGAIN. THAT WEBSITE HAS BECOME TAKES A LOOK AT THAT IN ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN BE REFERRED TO THE WEBSITE. FOR THE INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED EVEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND NOW YOU'RE BEGINNING TO SEE PETE PEOPLE CONTENT SAY GO TO THE WEBSITE IT'S FASTER- THAT'S ALL THAT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT REALLY I'M TELLING YOU WHERE WE ARE. DOING OUR BEST- ANY IDEAS YOU HAVE YOU KNOW I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF LEGISLATORS THAT'S OF GOOD IDEAS ABOUT. HOW TO HANDLE THIS. WE'LL BE WORKING WITH YOU EVEN CLOSER- YOU KNOW AS THESE ARE AS WE BURN DOWN THESE APPLICATIONS THAT YOU HAVE. REALLY THIS IS NOT LOST ON ME AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. OKAY EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR IN YOUR NEW FRAUD UNIT IT WOULD APPEAR SEKHEMRE WE'VE GOT A WOMAN THAT- THE SHE PROBABLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AN INMATE AND NON INMATE RELATED FOUGHT BETWEEN JAILS AND STATE PRISONS. THE PUBLIC ET DE IS- THERE'S NO STRONG CHECKS AND BALANCES THE CATCHER DEVICE IN FULL FROM CELL PHONES AND COMPUTERS THAT ARE FILED. THEY DON'T CAPTURE IP ADDRESSES WHEN PEOPLE RE UPPED THEIR CLAIMS- IS THAT TRUE OR YOU GUYS ARE YOU GUYS REVAMPING HEALTH YOUR NEW FRAUD UNIT. SET NEED VARIOUS WITH EDT- SO. I'M I'M A LITTLE BIT UNFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE PHONE- EXAMPLE THE PHONE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE BUT I DO KNOW THAT- THE I. P. ADDRESS IS CERTAINLY ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR- FRIED CRITERIA. WELL THE SAME THING IS THE PHONE BECAUSE THE PHONE WILL HAVE AN ID NUMBER IF THEY'RE DOING IT FOR ME. I'M I'M A CELL PHONE ALSO. SO I MEAN ESPECIALLY WITH MEDIA FRAUD IN MULTIPLE CASES. RESIGNING FROM ONE I. P. ADDRESS SO ARE YOU ABLE TO CATCH THAT NOW. I MEAN I I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THAT CONVERSATION OFFLINE SO WE DON'T DISCUSS ALL OF THE BROAD CRITERIA ONLINE BUT I'M IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I WOULD ASSUME THAT WE HAVE IF IT IS- IF IT IS. AS YOU SAY RELATED TO I. P. ADDRESS RIGHT. IN ORDER TO GET RID. I'M SORRY GO AHEAD. SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING WITH- YES. ON FRIDAY ISSUES. WE HAVE A TASK FORCE WITH. OTHER DISTRICT ATTORNEYS WHO WERE WORKING WITH NOW AS WELL WHICH IS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WORKFORCE AGENCIES OUT OF WHICH EACH IS A PART. AND DEREK IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR ANY IDEA. ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WE WANT TO HEAR IT I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR YOU WHAT EXACTLY IS AND THEY WORK WITH- YES WHAT EXACTLY IS- YES DOING. HEY AT THE VARIOUS WITH WITH- EDT OUT SO- YES WE'RE EDT IS PART OF A TASK FORCE WITH- WE ASK THAT INCLUDES- THE U. S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S THE F. B. I.'S CDC ARE. AND BASICALLY WHAT WE DO IS SHARE DATA WITH THEM SO WE CAN CATCH THE CRIMINALS I SUPPOSE IF THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD SAY IT- THERE WAS SOME ISSUES. YOU KNOW. EIGHT MONTHS AGO I SUPPOSE- WHERE THE DATA WASN'T GETTING TO THE UP TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND TIMELY MANNER SO WE NOW HAVE A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT WHERE- ALL THOSE ENTITIES HAVE ACCESS TO THE DATA. AND THEY CAN RECEIVE THE DATA. FINALLY I'M SO THEY CAN GO AFTER THE CRIMINALS THAT ARE YOU KNOW STEALING. ON THE U. ISIS. OKAY THE OTHERS THIS IS OVER A HUNDRED MILLION IS PROBABLY CLOSER TO A BILLION DOLLARS. SO HAVE YOU RECOVERED ANY FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS. FROM A CURSORY INDIVIDUALS- THERE ACTUALLY WAS- SOME RECOUPING OF MONEY I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME BUT IT WAS THROUGH THE- I BELIEVE IT WAS HROUGH ONE OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WORKING WITH EDT SOMEONE WAS CONVICTED. AND WE DID RECOUP SOME OF THAT MONEY I I'M SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE AMOUNT IN FRONT OF ME. EXPENSES DIRECTOR AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU WE ARE GOING TO COLLECT EVERY PENNY WE CAN'T. IF IT'S NOT SPENT ALREADY- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LISTEN IF IT'S HIDDEN ANYWHERE IN ANY ASSETS OR ANYTHING WE WANT THAT MONEY. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SCIENCE THANK YOU MISTER COOPER A MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR UP FIRST BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AAIN AND THANK- DIRECTOR CENTS FOR- THIS UNDERTAKING I DO I'VE SAID IT BEFORE BOTH IN OUR PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL AS IN THIS COMMITTEE. I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE EXPERIENCE YOU BRING TO THIS AND I DO APPRECIATE ALSO HOW OVERWHELMING OF A TASK THIS IS- AND- I THINK WHATEVER PARK. COLLEAGUES ARE ASKING IS TO HELP PROVIDE YOU WITH THE SUPPORT AND AMMUNITION YOU NEED BUT AT THE SAME TIME. INFORMATION SHARING IS WHAT'S GONNA ALLOW US TO BETTER GET TO A SOLUTION- SO BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTIONS JUST TO PIGGYBACK ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO FROM MISTER COOPER WAS ASKING. HAVE YOU DONE FORENSICS TO SEE FOR EXAMPLE HOW MANY OF THE CHECKS THAT WERE ARONIE ASLI OR FRAUDULENTLY. MAILED OUT AND RECEIVED HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN CASHED SET LIST THAT WE WERE WORKING BACKWARDS AND BLOCKING THE ONES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CASHED YET WHAT KIND OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO SEE TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN STOP THE BLEEDING. FOR HER FOR HER. GET ANY NUMBERS ON THAT DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY NUMBERS ON THAT. THIS IS DIRECTOR SIGNED SO. LET ME STATE THAT WELL WE CAN PROVIDE IDENTIFICATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WE ARE NOT IN INVESTIGATIONS. ORGANIZATION THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WORK OUT WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND THE FBI AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW ANY OTHER NATIONAL. OF PRODUCT ORIENTED ORGANIZATIONS SO IT WOULDN'T BE IT WOULDN'T BE E. D. D. THAT WOULD HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT WOULD BE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS. AT IF I MAY INTERRUPT FOR A MINUTE I RESPECT THAT AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I HOPE I'M NOT ASKING ANYTHING THAT REVEALS TOO MUCH WHAT I'M SPECIFICALLY ASKING IS THAT THE BANK A PATH ACCOUNTS THAT ARE THAT THE EDT CHECKS ARE DISPERSED FROM OUR UNDER YOUR PURVIEW AND CONTROL. SO HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE. THESE CHECKS THAT HAVE BEEN FRAUDULENTLY ISSUED HOW MANY OF THEM HAVE EVEN BEEN CASHED. DO WE KNOW THAT. VARIOUS WITH THE EIGHTIES SO I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER OF HOW MANY HAVE BEEN CASH VERSUS HAVE NOT BEEN CASH BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU ENOUGH I THINK YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY SAY THE SAME- INFORMATION- YOU KNOW THAT WHERE EDT IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WORK TOGETHER ON A CASE AND YOU KNOW THAT OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHERE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WILL SEE THEY'RE DOING AN INVESTIGATION YOU KNOW BASED ON INFORMATION THAT YOU DD HAS PROVIDED TO THEM. AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE CHECKS OR MULTIPLE CARDS THAT ARE- OBTAINED FROM YOU KNOW INDIVIDUAL'S HOW THE STORE OR WHATEVER- AND SO WE DO. HOW THOSE YOU KNOW AS A RECORD IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING OKAY SO DO WE KNOW OF THE NUMBER OF FRAUDULENT. CHECKS ISSUED- SO WE ARE ALL PART THAT INFORMATION RIGHT NOW- SO YOU KNOW WE HAD EARLIER THIS YEAR AS YOU REMEMBER WE HAD THE FRAUD NUMBERS THAT WE WORKED WITH THAT- AUDITOR ON ENGINE AND WHILE THAT WHILE WE HAD THAT NUMBER WE WERE THERE WAS THAT ONE POINT FOUR EIGHT MILLION- SPOT THAT WAS PENDING AND SO THAT THOSE NUMBERS WE ARE UPDATING THOSE NUMBERS AND TO JUST TAKE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT- YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW WE'VE SAID THIS AND ASK COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHERE- WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH ONE OF OUR VENDOR PARTNERS EXTEND SURE. TO DO AN ANALYSIS ON ALL OF THE FRAUD TO FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW IT TOO ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER IS- EARLIER POINT YOU KNOW WHAT SOME OF THE CRITERIA IS THAT SHOULD BE USED SHOULD NOT BE USED SHOULD BE REFINED- WE WILL HAVE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING. THAT THEY'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AS WE SPEAK. FRIEDMAN IS THERE AND I DO WANT TO SAY THIS I HOPE ARMY- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IDEA. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT WHEN WE LEAVE THESE HEARINGS. WE TAKE ANY IDEA THAT YOU OFFER US. AND WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT IT WILL ASSIST YOU IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA SO. WELL WE CAN'T WE CAN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION RIGHT NOW I WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT YEAH I APPRECIATE. THE SUGGESTION. OKAY WELL THEN WE'LL LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU I WOULD HOPE THAT I WOULD GET AN ANSWER FROM- FROM YOU MISDIRECT HER. AT SOME POINT IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE THAT WILL ALL OF OUR COLLEAGUES SHOULD BE RECEIVING BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE BEST WAY OF DEALING WITH SOMETHING. OBVIOUSLY IS TO WORK BACKWARDS AND SEE WHERE YOU CAN STOP THE BLEEDING- BUT THAT WAS THAT WAS I WASN'T EVEN INTERESTED IN ASKING THAT QUESTION THAT WAS JUST A FOLLOW TO MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION BECAUSE I WANTED TO SEE- IF WE HAVE. APPROACHED IT INVERSELY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE. SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT ANSWER. I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS AND THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE QUESTION I JUST ASKED ANYWAY SO. SOME OF THE EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THRUST ON YOU. ARE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE. BUT THE PREPARATION FOR THINGS YOU ANTICIPATE. SHOULDN'T BE CONTRIBUTING TO NEW PROBLEMS. SO IT IN IN IN THAT SPIRIT WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS FOR EXAMPLE YEAH THE VIDEO EXPLANATIONS. OF FOR THE U. I. CLAIMS THAT WHOSE BENEFIT JUST ENDED IN MID MARCH. THE VIDEO EXPLANATIONS AND FROM YOUR OFFICE WERE PUBLISHED APRIL SEVENTH. WHICH WERE PRETTY CREATED A THREE WEEK DELAY WHICH MEANS THAT DURING THAT THREE WEEK PERIOD A LOT OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WERE CALLING OUR OFFICES- AND ASKING. HOW TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD N. N. AND PLACING A NEW CLAIM. SO WHEN YOU ANTICIPATE A CERTAIN DEADLINE APPROACHING A CERTAIN TIMELINE COMING WHEN YOU CAN DOVE TAIL YOUR NEW PROGRAM OR NEW PROJECT. THAT SHOULD ALREADY BE ANTICIPATED AND THE ROLL OUT OF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN SIGNIFICANTLY. LONGER PERIOD BEFORE SO THAT YOU YOU ARE ALREADY ADDRESSING. CONSTITUENTS QUESTIONS BEFORE THEY EVEN HAVE TO NOT GET BEAT DOWN OUR DOORS HOWEVER I WAS AND- IS THE FIRST THING TO HEAR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TALK ABOUT A HUNDRED CALLS DURING THE WEEKEND. AS I'VE MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY TO YOU GUYS RECENT AS OUR PHONE CONVERSATION FROM TWO WEEKS AGO BUT I'M STILL AVERAGING ABOUT FORTY CALLS A DAY. JUST FROM PEOPLE RENEWING. AND THIS IS BEEN GOING ON SINCE MARCH SO- YOU KNOW THE APPEAL BACKLOG IS ALSO ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN WEEKS. FROM WHAT WE'RE BEING TOLD BY OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE CALLING OUR OFFICE- AND THE- THE CLAIMANT INTERVIEW BACKLOG IS A TEN WEEK WAIT. AND THE WE'VE WE'VE HAD CONSTITUENTS COLLISON TELUS THAT THAT THEY'VE BEEN WINNING. SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS BECAUSE- AND BY THE WAY WENT WHEN YOU WERE EXPLAINING A LITTLE WHILE AGO ABOUT THE EXAMPLE OF A- OF A CONSTITUENT NOT READING THEIR CHECK I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT NOT ALL. PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED THROUGH A CHECK OH NO ABSOLUTELY NOT SOME OF THE PAYMENTS AS YOU WELL KNOW ARE COMING ESPECIALLY THE ONES FROM BE OF A ARE AUTOMATICALLY DEPOSITED AND SO. HOW THE COMMUNICATION BE AT THAT POINT. I'M ASSUMING IT WOULD BE AN EMAIL ACCOUNT. I LOOKED THROUGH THE EMAIL NEVER COME OUT THROUGH THE EMAIL ACCOUNT. AND THROUGH THE TEXT. I WISH WE WERE AT A PLACE WHERE I COULD ASK YOU OF THE PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE COMMUNICATING BY TEXT. WHAT ARE YOU WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE ARE YOU SEEING FROM THAT ARE THOSE THE ONES THAT CONTINUE THEN TRYING TO MAKE PHONE CALLS. OR ARE IN THE BOTTLE NECK CONTRIBUTING TO THE BOTTOM BACK OR BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED THE TAXED ARE THEY NOT CONTRIBUTING TO THE BOTTLENECK I MEAN IT'S WE'RE WE'RE NOT EVEN IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN BE DISCUSSING SOME OF THESE FORENSICS AND THAT'S WHAT'S VERY TROUBLING TO ME. DIRECTOR- SO. AGAIN I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN COLLABORATION I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE SOME OF THESE ANSWERS AND ALSO SOME OF THE- ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY. PROVIDED YOU WITH THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. LIKE IT DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION HOWEVER I HAVE NO QUESTION I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ECHO THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN CLEARLY EXPRESSED BY. MY COLLEAGUES AND HERE'S THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION THAT I WOUL- JUST SHARE. IN BEHALF OF THOSE IN MY DISTRICT THAT- CONTINUALLY. AS AN THE CASELOADS ARE. QUITE GARGANTUAN- AND I KNOW YOU'RE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN BUT WE HAVE TO BE BETTER MAN WE JUST HAVE TO BE BETTER AND I'D SAY THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE IS ONCE WE WORK THROUGH A PROBLEM WITH THE CONSTITUENT. THE BEST ANSWER THEY GET IS IT'S GOING TO BE WEEKS. BEFORE THEY GET. ANY KIND OF- INCOME. AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT ANY BETTER IT I MEAN I CALL AGAIN DECADE THAT SUICIDAL RIGHT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE EXTREMELY DESPERATE. MANY OF WHICH HUNDREDS THAT WE CONTACT HAVE NO OUTSIDE SUPPORT NETWORK THEY DON'T HAVE FAMILIES THEY DON'T HAVE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER WAY. TO OF EACH. AND WHEN YOU'RE TOLD THAT THE INCOME THAT YOU'RE- IT SHOULD BE PROVIDED BY THE GOVERNMENT. IS WEEKS AWAY IT'S A HORRIBLE SATURATION FOR OUR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS THAT TO THE CONSTITUENCY AND WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER AN ACCELERATION OF- PAYMENTS ONCE WE IDENTIFY THAT- PAYMENT IS DUE AND I HOPE WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO THAT. I AGREE WITH YOU. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT EVERY DAY. OUR OUR OUR I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO GET THE IMPRESSION. THAT THERE ARE THERE'S ANY SELF SATISFACTION HERE WE ARE MAKING PROGRESS- WE ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE TODAY. THAT YOU JUST ARE. THE STORIES ARE ARE TERRIBLE- AND IT'S A PART OF WHAT PROPELS US FORWARD. SO I HEAR EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH YOU YOU'LL GET NO ARE. NO DEFENSOR EXCUSES FROM ME WE'RE JUST GOING TO KEEP WORKING TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO THAT PEOPLE GET THE BENEFITS THAT THEY DESERVE. THANK YOU MISTER LUCKY I THINK YOU DIRECTOR SIGNS WE DO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL FOLLOW UPS AS WELL. AND I ASK YOU ABOUT. ATTRITION AT EDT HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE HIRED AND TRAINED AND HOW MANY WORKERS HAVE LEFT. THE DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I CAN'T GIVE YOU THE SPECIFIC DETAILS. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS ABOUT BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH CALL CENTERS. BOTH IN THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. CALL CENTERS USUALLY EXPERIENCE A TURNOVER OF AT LEAST A THIRD EVERY YEAR. SO THAT THAT IS- THAT'S A INDUSTRY STANDARD- IT HAPPENS YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING FOR XEROX OR- UNDERWENT ARE. EDT AT THE- WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION ON HOW MANY PEOPLE I JUST DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD OUT OF ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT THE OTHER THING OF COURSE IS THAT WEHAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS AS ELL THIS IS YOU KNOW. IT'S THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE I'M I'M- NO ONE CAN MINIMIZE THE DIFFICULTY THAT THIS IS BECAUSE FOR SOME OF OUR CLIENTS. BUT IT ALSO CREATED A LOT OF PRESSURE FOR OUR STAFF AS WELL. AND ARE YOU KNOW A YEAR OF THIS WAS ARE JUST TOO MUCH FOR SOME PEOPLE. CURRENTLY LOCKED DR SIDES IF I MAY YES CAROLING CD SO APPY. OUTSIDE OF THE PANDEMIC I THINK WE'VE FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT THE BABY HAD A WORKFORCE THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORK FORCE OF ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY STAFF FROM THAT THIS WAS THE STAFF WORKING YOU ARE PRODUCTION NOT THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN- AS YOU ALL KNOW WE HAVE- FOURTEEN RECOMMENDATION WAS A STOP HIRING WE CAME THROUGH THAT WE HAVE BEEN EARNESTLY. TRYING TO SIT AND HAVE A MORE SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS OPERATION- SINCE REALLY THE BEGINNING OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. SO SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE HAVE HIRED FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO EMPLOYEES IN YOUR LIFE. AT THAT OCCUR- THIRTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN HAVE LEFT SO THAT'S YOUR QUESTION REGARDING NUTRITION AND I BILL DO BELIEVE THAT'S ABOUT 25% AND THAT IS HOW IT IS VERY AS YOU ALL KNOW THE ISSUES THAT ON YOUR STAFF OR DEALING WITH OUR STAFF TO DEAL WITH EVERY DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK- THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE SHIP IN OVERTIME IT IS VERY STRESSFUL TIME BUT IT'S CERTAINLY MORE STRESSFUL FOR CLIENTS THAT WE BELIEVE IN THAT STATE AT THE FOREFRONT OF OUR HEART SO IT HAS BEEN CHALLENGING TO HIRE IT'S BEEN MORE CHALLENGING TO RETAIN- BUT IT CONTINUES TO BE WHAT WE'RE- CURRENTLY WORKING ON IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT WITH AN EDT. SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION IT DOES THANK YOU SO THAT SENT OUT ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY STAFF ORIGINALLY ADORABLE HIRED A FOUR THOUSAND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO BRINGING IT TO A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY TO WIN THE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN THAT LEFT. CORRECT COULD THAT'S MORE THE ORIGINAL STAFF THAT YOU HAD SO I'M I'M IMAGINING THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE THAT ALSO LEFT HARTMAN. ABSOLUTELY AND WHAT IF THEY'RE THAT HAVE SURVIVED THROUGH- THEY ARE PHENOMENAL THEY FOR THEY ARE AND THEY ARE FULLY FULLY COMMITTED THE CONTRITION TENDS TO BE WITH SOME OF THE NEWER STAFF BUT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT IT'S HARD TO TELL IT'S COMPLEX- IT'S PRETTY GRUELING AND- IF. IT IF THEY'RE NOT MADE FOR IT IS IT IS CAN BE HEARTBREAKING ABSOLUTELY STRESSFUL. SEVEN I HAVE MY SECOND QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE WHAT'S THAT HOW ARE THE HOW OR THE ACTUAL WORKERS AFFECTED BY THE VOLUME OF WORK AND HOW ARE THEY MANAGING A NIGHT AND I AM BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE I ALSO DO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU. TO YOU AND TO YOUR STAFF AND TO EVERYONE AT EDT I KNOW THAT IT IS HARD AND DIFFICULT AND THAT DOESN'T GO UNNOTICED AND I KNOW THAT OUR DISTRICT STAFFS ARE ALSO AT CAPACITY AS WELL. AND SO I'M WONDERING IF YOU GOT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. HOW THE WORKERS ARE DOING. I IT IS IT'S BETTER TO. FROM FOR THEMWE HEAR FROM THEM EVERY SINGLE DAY- BUT- WELL WE ARE STILL IN A PANDEMIC ORGANIZATIONALLY WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DO WHAT HAS ALWAYS WORKED WORK BEST. NOT ONLY THE EDB BUT IN ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IS THE TEAM BUILDING THE TEAM WORK THE TRAINING THAT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED FOR ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS THOSE ARE REALLY IT'S NOT TRAINING JUST TO TRAIN. BOTH THE TRAINING THAT IS AVAILABLE TO EMPLOYEES IT HELPS THEM BASICALLY SURVIVE IT HELPS THEM CONTINUE THEIR MARKET STRENGTHENED THEIR MOTIVATION THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE MISSION SO WE HAVE REINSTITUTED TRAINING- TEAM MEETINGS STAFF MEETINGS ALL OF THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PUT ON THE WAYSIDE IN THE SHELF SO WE COULD GET DIRECT FULL TIME PRODUCTION WHILE THAT IS STILL PARAMOUNT. EMPLOYEES ARE ALSO PARAMOUNT BECAUSE THE HEALTHIER THEY ARE THE BETTER THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND- THIS IS THIS THE DIRECTOR SO I JUST WANTED TO- THANK YOU FOR THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE STAFF I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE I FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO WORK IN A DURING. THIS THIS STARTED. OUT THIS IS A CALLING. AND THAT'S THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STATE AND SUPPORT THEIR YOUR COLLEAGUES TO STAY AS WELL. THANK YOU I KNOW THAT IN THE PAST WE HAVE DISCUSSED- SOME VACANCIES WITH THE WITH EDT AND I AM I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON ENSURING THAT. THOSE VACANCIES ARE FILLED IS THERE A- A U. I. CHIEF OR AS A DIRECTOR THAT STRICTLY FOCUS UPON YOU I. YES THERE IS. A BAND JOB CAROL SINCE YOU HIRED GOODNESS YEP. BY YOU MIGHT WANT TO JUST GIVE A LITTLE BACKGROUND ON HER. SET MY PLEASURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE HAVE HIRED GRACIE A- STATEN SHE IS FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT- SHE HAS PRIOR KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE. WHAT IS YOUR CAREER STARTED AT EDT SO SHE HAS EDT- DISABILITY INSURANCE AS WELL AS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. SO SHE- BEGAN EARLY CAREER AT EDT YOU WHY ALL THE WAY THROUGH I BELIEVE THE- THE MID LEVEL WHERE THEY- WERE THEY WOULD COME AND EAT PR'S WHERE THEIR EXPERT TECHNICIANS AND CLAIM FILING. BEGAN HER MANAGERIAL EXPERIENCE AND THEN MOVED ON. TO BE AN EXECUTIVE AT THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT. AND WE ARE SO GREAT TO HAVE HER BACK US IT'S LIKE COMING HOME SHE HAS PULLED RIGHT IN I BELIEVE HER START DATE WAS BEGINNING OF MARCH MARCH APRIL BEGINNING OF APRIL SORRY- WE DID ANNOUNCE IT TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE OF IT IS IMPORTANT WE HAVE THAT EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND SHE HAS HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AND SHE'S ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ALL THE PROGRAMS HE'S. HAPPY INTRODUCED HER TO YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT I WASN'T AWARE BUT IT'S GOOD THAT WE ARE NOW IN A POSITION WHERE THOSE POSITIONS ARE BEING FILLED AND- CAN- CAN REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO JUST THE IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AS WE LOOK FORWARD AND- GET INTO- MAY REVISE CONVERSATIONS. I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE- THE CONTRACT RELATED TO BENEFIT INSURANCE AND I KNOW MISTER NECESSARY AND BROUGHT IT BROUGHT IT UP A LITTLE BIT EARLIER TODAY BUT WELL THE NEW CONTRACT FOR BENEFIT BENEFIT ISSUANCE OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR DIRECT DEPOSIT. THE VARIOUS WITH ADD YES IT WILL AND WE ARE NOT WAITING FOR THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT DIRECT DEPOSIT AS WE SPEAK. GREAT OPTIONS ON DIRECT DEPOSIT. THAT'S GREAT TOO ODD THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PANEL AS WE MOVE FORWARD WELL I JUST UGH SEEING NINE I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- PROVIDING US NECESSARY INFORMATION I THINK- THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE LEFT OUTSTANDING THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE BUDGET BUDGET STAFF- GETS TO USE THAT WE GET SOME PROPER RESPONSES AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR- I ACTUALLY HAD ONE MORE QUESTION A RELATED TO THE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ADDITIONAL STAFF IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THAT DIRECTION WAS GIVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE CAN YOU PROVIDE US WITH- JUST SOME BASIC INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW IS IT COMMUNICATED TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY NEW STAFF WERE AVAILABLE WITH THAT INFORMATION GIVEN TO OUR LEADERSHIP OR TWO CHIEFS OF STAFF OR HOW WHAT IS THE PROCESS IN WHICH- LEGISLATIVE OFFICES WILL BE ABLE TO LITERALLY HAND OVER CASE WORK- THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON TO THESE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. NEW STAFF MEMBERS AND HOW WILL THE PROCESS WORK MOVING FORWARD WOULD EACH OFFICE RECEIVED ONE STAFF SINCE THERE'S A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY. LEGISLATORS SO THIS IS KEVIN WITH STRICTER JEDEDIAH SPEAK TO THAT- SO THE HUNDRED TWENTY STOPS WILL BE ADDED TO THE SIXTY STAFF BETTER. WORK ON LEGISLATIVE REFERRALS FULL TIME SAME PROCESS WORKING ON THE COMPLEX CASES- BUT- SUBMITTED INTO THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. THAT WE HAVE TRAINED OFFICERS ON HOW TO INPUT CASES ON. SO I GET THE LINE UP WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED TWENTY OFFICES BUT THAT'S JUST A COINCIDENCE BUT- BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STAFF. ARE COMING FROM THE U. I BRANCH. OUT TO WORK ON THOSE MORE COMPLEX CASES THE FEEDBACK WE'VE BEEN GETTING WAS. HOPING FOR MORE RESPONSIVENESS ON THOSE CASES IN PARTICULAR SO WORKING TO ADDRESS THAT- SEVERAL OUT WAS SHARED WITH- LEADERSHIP BY ANNOUNCED IT ON OUR- I WEEKLY LETTERS CALL THAT- ALL OFFICE. ARE INVITED TO WE OFTEN HAVE OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS ON THAT CALL. SO TRY TO GET THAT INFORMATION OUT THERE BECAUSE WANTED TO ASSURE OFFICES THAT SOME HELP WAS COMING. AND COMMUNICATE THAT THAT CHANGE TO THEM. CAN YOU PROVIDE ME WITH LET ME JUST EXPLAIN THAT. THOSE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE BACKGROUND WORKING WITH THE LIAISONS AND WORKING ON ANY CASES. THAT HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE FOR AWHILE. IT IS. WE HAVE FOUND THAT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA TO. SHIFT OR CHANGE LIAISONS WITH THE OFFICE OF THAT USUALLY RESULTS IN OUR SOME AMOUNT OF UPSET BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THEIR LIAISONS. SO THESE HUNDRED TWENTY PEOPLE WILL HELP THOSE LIAISONS- GET THOSE CASES RESULT. AND I JUST UNLESS YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION- MADAM CHAIRMAN. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY. THAT THIS HEARING. AS PRODUCED THE RESULT THAT I HAD HOPED FOR I THINK THAT WE HAVE HAD. A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT THE THINGS THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT AND SOME SUGGESTIONS AND I HAVE ALWAYS FOUND LEGISLATORS WILLING TO GIVE ME IDEAS I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF THESE IDEAS ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND DEBT WE WILL TAKE THIS BACK AND- THIS EXPERIENCE BACK IN THESE QUESTIONS BACK AND USE THEM. TO IMPROVE WHAT WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SCIENCE WE'RE NOT QUITE DONE OF MR CHIU AND I HAVE ALSO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO THE TO THE LIAISON FOR. BUT BUT JUST ONE FALLS IN THE POINT OF THAT THE LIAISONS AND FIRST OF ALL. THAT IS INCREDIBLY WELCOME NEWS I THINK WE HEARD SOME RUMORS THAT THAT MIGHT BE HAPPENING BUT APPRECIATE HEARING THAT- TODAY IN PUBLIC- I. UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WANT TO WORK WITH YOUR LIAISONS I WOULD JUST SUGGEST. I THINK THE EXPERIENCE OF MANY OF OUR OFFICES IS THAT OUR LIAISONS- ONLY. INTERFACE WITH OUR OFFICES FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OF TIME SO IT'S A SET NUMBER OF HOURS A WEEK. AND I THINK THE HOPE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ADDITIONAL STAFFERS IS AT. OUR OFFICES WOULD BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THEM FORTY HOURS A WEEK- AND ENGAGING IN THAT WAY AS OPPOSED TO POTENTIALLY BEING BOTTLENECK THROUGH. THE LIAISON WHO MAY NOT BE INTERFACING WITH OUR OFFICE FORTY HOURS A WEEK SO. THAT JUST WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THE MORE. I THINK WE CAN EMBED. THOSE NEW STAFF IN OUR OFFICES THAT WOULD REALLY. REALLY HELP. IT'S A IT'S A PLEA. THANK YOU MR CHIU I DIRECTOR SIGNS I WOULD HIGHLY HIGHLY ENCOURAGE YOU AND YOUR TEAM I THINK THAT YOU WOULD FIND GRATITUDE FROM THE LEGISLATURE IF IT'S ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM OUR STAFF WE HAVE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE DOING THE WORK OF SERVING OUR DISTRICT AND THE REALITY IS THAT WITH OUR DISTRICT STAFF MOST OF THE TIME. DEALING WITH EDT CASES THAT'S NOT IN THEIR JOB PER VIEW FOR THE PAST YEAR A LOT OF OTHER THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON- ISN'T GETTING DONE FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK RELATED TO HELPING SMALL BUSINESSES WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE THAT A CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO PAY BACK THEIR RENT A LOT OF- A GOLDEN STIMULUS. AGENDA ITEMS THAT WE HAVE MOVED FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE THRIVING BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT OUR DISTRICT STAFF IN OUR DISTRICT TEAMS. ARMS HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AS THEY NORMALLY WOULD BECAUSE THEY'RE WORKING ON VERY IMPORTANT EDT CASES. WHICH IS NOT TRADITIONALLY THEIR JOB SO WE STILL HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES IN OUR OFFICE THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE GET TAKEN CARE OF. AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT GETTING THE PRIORITY THAT IT DESERVES. BECAUSE OUR STAFFS ARE WORKING ON EDT CASES. SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER REDIRECTING. THE WAY IN WHICH THOSE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT FULL TIME STAFF MEMBERS WILL BE PARTICIPATING BECAUSE THE LIAISONS ARE NOT ENOUGH. IT'S A PART TIME POSITION AND THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S OUR DISTRICT STAFF THAT CONTINUES TO DO THE WORK OF EDT AND THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE AT THIS POINT. SO WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE THIS OUT IN A REAL WAY. SO THAT AGAIN. OUR DISTRICT TEAMS AND STAFF THE CONTINUES TO WORK ON EDT CASES WHICH IS NOT THEIR JOB. I HAVE SOME KIND OF. GOAL AND MEASUREMENT IN WHICH THOSE CASES. WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY EDT. AND OUR STAFF WILL BE RELIEVED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE DUTIES THAT THEY- HAVE BEEN HIRED TO DO. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF OUR DISTRICTS AND OUR AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE- ARE MEANT TO SERVE.

THANK YOU IF I WERE TO GET GOING THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. AND SO I BELIEVE YOU HAD QUESTIONS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL RECALL. YES OKAY- SO IF I RECALL YOUR QUESTIONS CORRECTLY YOU HAD A QUESTION ABOUT- WHY- THE COSTS WOULD BE SO HIGH THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS ELECTIONS WELL FOR THE RECALL ELECTION I COULD PAY FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE I DO KNOW WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COUNTY CLERK'S ELECTION OFFICIALS ASSOCIATION ON THE FOLLOWING ALSO BUT WE ARE NOT IN THE STAGE YET- TO DETERMINE ANY COSTS FOR THE POTENTIAL SPECIAL ELECTION. I WANT TO GET TO THAT PAGE AFTER WERE DONE WITH THEIR SIGNATURE RECALL DAYS WE CAN WORK WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE WILL TOPPLE THE WORK WITH THE COUNTY ELECTIONS OFFICIALS ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DETERMINE THOSE ANTICIPATED COSTS SO WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT- THAT EVALUATION. YET BUT WE WILL DO THAT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THANK YOU MESCALINE WHAT WE HEAR FROM MISS DONNA JOHNSTON. CENTER CAMPUS CENTER COUNTY CLERK IN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLERKS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THE SPECIAL ELECTION COSTS. A GOOD AFTERNOON I AM DONNA JOHNSTON SUTTER COUNTY REGISTER VOTERS CURRENT PRESIDENT OF. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CLARKSON ELECTIONS OFFICIALS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS CA CEO. THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS SESSION AND GIVING OUR ASSOCIATION THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS ELECTION COSTS WITH YOU. SEE A SENIOR WAS BEEN COLLECTING PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION COST DATA BACK TO THE PRIMARY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. IT'S A VOLUNTARY STUDY AND THEREFORE NOT ALL COUNTIES PROVIDE DATA THE FIRST PRIMARY OF TWENTY THOUSAND TO TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE HAD AN AVERAGE COST OF SEVEN DOLLARS PER VOTER. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TRI PRIOR TO THE PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION AVERAGE COSTS FOR. UP TO TWELVE DOLLARS PER VOTER. THE COST FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ROSE TO AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER VOTER FROM THE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES WHO RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY SO FAR. WE CONTINUE AT THE STATE TO COLLECT DATA FROM COUNTIES HAD NOT RESPONDED. TAKING THE EIGHTEEN DOLLAR PER VOTER. NUMBER AND MULTIPLYING IT TO THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE STATE FOR THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION THE RESULT IS JUST UNDER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. MORE PRECISELY- THREE HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION. THE SIX DOLLAR PER VOTER COST INCREASE. JUST FROM MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WERE LARGELY RESULT OF MANDATES. THESE INCLUDED COVERT RELATED ITEMS SUCH AS BP ABOVE WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE SO GRACIOUSLY PROVIDED. EAST COAST WHICH FOR A ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION WHICH INCLUDED BOTH OUTGOING AND INCOMING BALLOTS IN PERSON VOTING OPPORTUNITIES FOLLOWING COKE PRODUCTS. PROTOCOLS INCREASED NUMBER OF REQUIRED BALLOT DROP BOXES INCREASED EARLY VOTING OPPORTUNITIES ADDING INTELLIGENT MAIL BARCODES TO ENVELOPES TO WORK WITHOUT TRACKING SYSTEMS AND INCREASED PROMOTED SOCIAL VOTING BY MAIL VOTING OPPORTUNITIES. BLOOD REGISTRATION DURING THIS TIME ALSO INCREASED ONE POINT THREE MILLION FROM THE PRIMARY ELECTION. IF THE SAME CONDITIONS EXIST FOR THE POTENTIAL RECALL THAT DID IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THE EXPECTED COST TO COUNTIES COULD BE UP TO THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. I HAVE TO SAY THAT CCO IS ENCOURAGED BY THE EARLY DIALOGUE. TO HOPEFULLY HELP RELIEVE THE COST OF OUR COUNTIES TO CONDUCT THE POTENTIAL RECALL ELECTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER JOHNSTON IS MR JOE WHITE ON THE LINE. I AM A LOT. OKAY LET'S THE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM EITHER THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. IF THE GENERATED ELECTED DIVISION AGAIN SO WE WILL WORK COOPERATIVELY OF COURSES DONNA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS AS WE GET TO THAT PAGE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING ON GETTING DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF ALL OF THE COSTS FOR THE ELECTION. I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE WITH DONNA THE- ALEXION COSTS HAVE CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE YEARS DUE TO ALL OF THE NEW LEGISLATION THAT HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE ON MAKING SURE THAT THE COUNTIES ARE FUNDED. FOR THE ELECTION THAT MAY NEED TO BE CALLED. THANK YOU- IS THERE SOMEONE FROM THE ALEJO'S OFFICE. HEY NICK SCHROEDER FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN SAID SO FAR IN TERMS OF THE FACT THAT ELECTION BECAUSE SEVEN INCREASING OVER TIME IT'S LARGELY DUE BECAUSE HOW PEOPLE VOTE HAS CHANGED A LOT. OVER TIME AS WELL AS THE- MANDATES THAT BEEN ESTABLISHED THE ONE THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THAT THE ASSOCIATION'S ESTIMATES WERE BASED ON THAT NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AND SO. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH A RECALL ELECTION WOULD HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION ADDS THAT NOVEMBER RECALL NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S COSTS ACTUALLY REFLECTED THE NOVEMBER ELECTION SO I REALLY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT A RECALL ELECTION MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF THE BALLOT. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT KIND OF PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS ARE IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OR THAT THE REGISTERS PREPARE FOR- IN ADVANCE FOR THAT SO REQUIRING PP OR LARGER FACILITIES- FOR IN PERSON VOTING OR FOR EARLY VOTING- AND THE LAST THING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IS. THAT AS THE LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD AND CONSIDERING WHAT IF ANY- STATE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED- TO ASSIST COUNTIES. IN ANY RECALL ELECTION WOULD BE TO EXPLORE TO WHAT EXTENT OF THE STATE'S FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR THE COVETED RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ELECTION- WE AS END OF THE STATE RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY THROUGH THE A. R. P. AND THE STATE HAS A FAIRLY WIDE DISCRETION HOW TO USE THAT MONEY THAT BEING SAID. WE'RE WAITING FROM- U. S. TREASURY TO GET THE ACTUAL SPECIFICS OF HOW THE FUNDS CAN BE USED- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO OFFSET AT LEAST A PORTION OF THE COSTS WHATEVER THEY END UP BEING- FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO JUST WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ON THE RADAR FOR THE LEGISLATURE- MOVING. FOR THANK YOU IS THERE SOMEONE FORM- MISS JOHNSON DEPARTED FINANCE. THANK YOU TO MARK JOHNSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WOULD LIKE TO NOTE AS WELL THAT IT IS A VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS TO HAVE ESTIMATED COSTS AT THIS TIME BUT FINANCE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH- THE ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. TO ESTIMATE- TO COME UP WITH THAT THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND ALSO DO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE. HELLO I HAVE A COUNTIES BEGAN PLANNING HOW TO ABSORB THE ADDITIONAL COST MISTER JOHNSTON. CANDIES ARE PREPARING TO GO TO THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO ASK FOR THE COSTS POTENTIAL COST FOR THE ELECTIONS WHEN THEY ARE AT THIS POINT IN TIME GATHERING DATA TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN GIVE AN ACCURATE. REFLECTION OF WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO EACH COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THIS IS YOUR HELL TO FUND THE SELECTION. SOME HARD DECISIONS WE HAVE TO BE MADE. UHHUH AND HERE'S THE HERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORICAL QUESTION BUT HOW MUCH DID THE TWO THOUSAND THREE WE CALL COST AND WHO PAID FOR THOSE COSTS. SERVICES DAN ARRANGEMENT SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE NOW I WOULD LIKE. THAT THE TWO THOUSAND THREE ALEXION WHATNOT CONDUCTED AS AN ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION. I THINK WHAT THE ALIENS OFFICE HAS BOOTED YOU KNOW ACTION LOG AND CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. SPENT THEIR TWO THOUSAND AND THREE ELECTION- ALSO THAT WE HAVE COSTS LIKE IT'S BECAUSE THE CUTS RELIGIOUS SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. FOR THE ACT THE TWO THOUSAND THREE RECALL ELECTION. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE DID PUT IN A BUDGET DEFICIENCY AT THE END OF AN NTICIPATED COSTS OF. THE STATE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE ON SUCH AS THE CONDENSED TIME FRAME TO PRINT AND MAIL. TRANSFORMATION GUIDE WE ARE UNAWARE THAT THE STATE OF REIMBURSED THE COUNTY FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE TWO THOUSAND THREE OR ELECTION. UNFORTUNATELY BY SEVERAL OF US FOLKS HERE WERE NOT CONDUCTING ELECTIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND THREE SO WE DO NOT HAVE THOSE RECORDS INTO. WHERE WHAT THE RECORD BECAUSE- WHERE OR THEY ARE I KNOW. A MAN I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. DETERMINE THE COST THAT WERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE AND WE WILL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE ALREADY ADDRESSED THIS AND I DON'T WANT TO. BELABOR THE FACT BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT LEAD CURRENT OF POTENTIAL RECALL WOULD BE CONDUCTED AT OF WITH EVERY REGARDING A VOTE BY MAIL BALLOT WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ANY ELECTION CALL AND ALSO THE VOTERS CHOICE ACT MODEL OF OPENING EARLY VOTING SITES AT THE L. A. YOU KNOW THE CAPTAIN AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS HAVE SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASE. SO I DO BELIEVE WE WOULD BE COMPARING APPLES AND ORANGES EXACTLY THAT AT ELECTION WAS CONDUCTED MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND I THOUGHT I WA WITH EIGHTEEN AKSAKOV HAVE GONE. SIGNIFICANTLY AT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I THINK THE ONE HOUR LECTURE THAT WE COULD LOOK TO ALTHOUGH IT WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE A COMPARISON WOULD BE THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NEWMAN RECALL ACTION THIS ELECTION WAS CONDUCTED ON THESE CURRENT- WE CONTACT YOU. HOWEVER THIS ELECTION WAS ONLY CONDUCTED AND WITH THREE COUNTY LOS ANGELES ORANGE AND SAMPOERNA DINO- IF THEIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WORKED WITH THESE THREE COUNTIES TO ESTIMATE THAT A STANDALONE ELECTION WOULD COST ABOUT TWO POINT SIX MILLION VOTERS IN MARCH TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS- I NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MANY VOTERS THAT ENTAILED BUT- JUST BELOW THAT OF THE- SENATE- COMMITTEE IS AWARE. THAT THIS ELECTION WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIMARY ELECTION SO THE ESTIMATED COST WOULD CLOSER. TO NINE HUNDRED THOUSAND. THANK YOU FOR THAT I AM- THE INFORMATION THAT IT'S NOT THE SAME. I'D SAY LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH IT COST WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE RECALL OF A GOVERNOR AND THIS POTENTIAL RECALL NOW ESPECIALLY IF. ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S OBVIOUSLY LAWS HAVE CHANGED IN. MORE CALIFORNIANS ARE VOTING BY MAIL AND- WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THEM NO NEED TO PUT A STAMP ON RETURNING YOUR BALLOT. HOWEVER I WOULD STILL LIKE TO KNOW ONE WHERE THE WHERE IS THE INFORMATION FOR WHAT IT COSTS IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND WHAT WOULD IT BE COMPARING IT. WHAT WOULD BE THE COMPARISON NOW. IN TERMS OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHEN YOU MAY KNOW THE COST. PLEASE REPLY COULD COME BUT I DID NOT HAVE THE- ACTUAL INFORMATION I CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH PROXIMATE LI FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AGAIN I WOULD NEED TO LOOK BACK AT THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED VOTERS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE- WENT LIVE VOTING BY MAIL AND- WHAT THE DIFFERENT COMPARISON WOULD BE FINE ALL MAIL BALLOT ELECTION SO WELL IT IS THE ONLY ABOUT ELECTIONS THOSE GIFT CERTIFICATE. ACCESS TO ALL VOTERS IT DOES HAVE A DIFFERENT CUSTOMER IN THE LECTION ILLINOIS I KEEP COMING BACK TO THAT BUT ACTUALLY INCREASE. THE ABILITY FOR VOTERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO LOADING AND THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE I THINK THAT DOES CREATE A COST. TO THE STATE AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN RUN VERY SUCCESSFULLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT THE NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION WAS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST- WELL RUN AND SECURE ELECTIONS THAT WE'VE HAD IN SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS. I WITH THAT IT WAS RUN UNDER THESE SPECIFIC NEW ALONG WITH A COUPLE OF YOU KNOW ALLOWING ALL BOATERS IN CALIFORNIA TO VOTE BY MAIL HOW THE EARLY VOTING OPTIONS AND HAVE DROP BOXES. AND OVERALL OPTIONS ON HOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE. YOU HAVE BEEN BUTCHERED. THANK YOU APRIL THAT BUT THE END OF MY QUESTION. DO YOU KNOW. WHEN DO THINK YOU WILL KNOW. THE APPROXIMATE. WE'VE GOT THE APARTMENT COMPLEX I HAVE IN ANY OF MY EXPERIENCE WE WILL WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION NOT BE DETERMINANT. OKAY SO RIGHT NOW DO YOU ACT YOU DON'T HAVE A POTENTIAL DATE AS TO WHEN YOU MIGHT KNOW. BUT FOR MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND. YES MA'AM I UNDERSTAND BUT NOT AT THIS TIME BUT I WILL DEFINITELY GET BACK WITH YOU IN THE NEW YEAR YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. IF AND IF WE CAN DETERMINE FACTUAL CROFT AND WHAT WOULD WHAT WOULD IN FACT REIMBURSED TO THE COUNTY. ONE FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT IS IF THE STATE. WHICH ALREADY PROVIDES FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR ELECTIONS WERE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR THE SPECIAL RECALL. WHAT WOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE SHARE OF COST. I DO THINK THIS IS A BIT PREMATURE FOR THAT WE STILL NEED TO WORK WITH ATTORNEYS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO DETERMINE WHAT COSTS WOULD BE- I THINK THAT LEN AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COULD ADDRESS THE STUDENTS WHETHER THE NEEDY. BUT THE STATE MANDATES HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS SO I DO KNOW THAT WHILE COUNTY ELECTION OFFICIALS WENT THOSE. CROPS ARE NO LONGER ACTIVE SPENDING THEY MAY BE ABLE TO COME BACK TO THE STATE TO. SECURE THOSE FINES BUT AS OF NOW WE COUNTY ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE NOT BEEN REIMBURSED FOR COUNTY ELECT FOR STATEWIDE ELECTION. IN THEIR COUNTIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS. GOT IT THANK YOU FOR THAT. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. OKAY WE ARE GOING TO HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THIS PANEL. WE ARE MOVING ON TO. CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER. THE MANAGED CARE AND FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS MONEY IT'S JUST AN HOUR AND THE DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR FISCAL POLICY ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 28% OUR SPRING FINANCE LETTER TO YOU AS YOU MAY RECALL EARLIER THIS YEAR WE ASK CAME IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE WIDE CHIEF EQUITY OFFICER POSITION WITHIN OUR AGENCY- UPON.

THANK YOU THAT MEASURES OUT LET'S GO TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE THANK YOU TO THE PANEL MUCH APPRECIATED DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION LET'S BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AMY TOM AND THE STATE YOU'RE FOR INFORMATION OFFICER AND ALSO DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. I WAS MY PLEASURE HERE TO- ADDRESS YOU ALL ARE WITH A COLLEAGUE- TWO COLLEAGUES OF MINE- WHO'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO WITH THE- PROPOSAL WITH MORE DETAILS AS I HAVE BEEN AWAY. AND JOINING THE VACCINE- A STRIKE TEAM SINCE JANUARY SO WITH THAT- LET WHICH INTRODUCE- I'M SO SORRY THE DOORBELL RANG. WITHOUT I'D LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO ON THE NEW CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND DEPUTY STATE CHAU- TO THE PROMINENT TECHNOLOGY- REST NICHOLS AS WELL AS OUR NEW. CHIEF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION OFFICER FOR THE STATE- ARE BRICK CLOUT SO. THANK YOU DIRECTOR KONG. I AFTERNOON I'M RUSTIC I AM THE NEW CHIEF DEPUTY AT CDT- THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU YES FOR TWO POSITIONS OVER TWO BUDGET YEARS ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FISCAL YEARS TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ARE THEY YEARS SPECIFICALLY. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS A TWO YEAR EFFORT TO PLAN AND DESIGN AND DEPLOY A PILOT IMPLEMENTATION FOR SYSTEM TO ELECTRONICALLY AND VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHEN THEY ACCESS THE STATE'S DIGITAL SERVICE THE PILOT WILL LOOK TO PROVE THE CONCEPT IN THE TECHNOLOGY COMPONENTS NECESSARY TO MEET OUR- GOALS AND AT THE END OF THE PILOT WE WOULD PRESENT BACK TO THE ADMINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE ARE OUTCOMES. IN A PROPOSAL FOR MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ROADMAP OF HOW TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OVERALL THE PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO SOLVE THREE MAJOR GOALS FOR THE STATE THE FIRST TO IMPROVE THE USER EXPERIENCE FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY ACCESS STATE SYSTEMS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THOSE SYSTEMS ARE BUILT AND MAINTAINED IN DEPARTMENTS INDEPENDENTLY. THAT LEVEL OF EITHER USER AUTHENTICATION AND IDENTITY MANAGEMENT IS DONE DEPARTMENT BY DEPARTMENT WHICH LEADS TO VERY DIFFERENT USER EXPERIENCE AS YOU TRANSITION ACROSS DIFFERENT. STATE SERVICES IN THE STATE. SECOND WE LOOK TO INCREASE BOTH. AND THE PRICE PROTECTIONS ALL OF THE- OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN BECAUSE THE SYSTEMS ARE MAINTAINED ACROSS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. RESIDENTS ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE THE SAME INFORMATION OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND IT IS STORED IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS SO THAT IS ACTUALLY LESS SECURE AND LESS MANAGED THAN IT WAS AT ONE UNIFIED AND CONSISTENT STRAIGHT UP. AND FINALLY BY REDUCING THAT REDUNDANCY OF HAVING DEPARTMENTS BUILD THE SAME SYSTEM THE SAME IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE LOOK TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE SERVICE BUT REDUCE THE REDUNDANCY AND COST ACROSS THE VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS. WITH THAT WE'RE HERE AND HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE BEHALF. THANK YOU MISTER NICHOLS AND CONGRATULATIONS. ON THE TOPIC. OF DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M SORRY LET'S GO FIRST TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. BRIAN IT'S GOOD LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS BUDGET REQUEST US PROPOSED- WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE PROPOSAL'S POLICY MERITS. A FIRST FOR ANY STATE ENTITY TO REQUEST FUNDING TO PLAN IT PROJECTS TO RECEIVE EIGHTEEN HOW PROCESS YET THE TEAM MUST SUBMIT A STAGE ONE BUSINESS ANALYSIS. THAT IS APPROVED BY SEATS NEED TO THE LEGISLATURE UPON REQUEST ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED TO OUR OFFENSE THAT pNOW DOCUMENTATION IS STILL UNDER REVIEW BY CDT. WHICH MEANS THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION IT. NEEDS TO FULLY EVALUATE THE PROPOSAL. THANK THE PROPOSAL TRIAL IN. IS TO LIMITED AND WHATNOT DEMONSTRATE HOW FOR EXAMPLE A SINGLE DIFFERENCE ALIKE IN A FIRE WHAT WORKS FOR MORE COMPLEX SERVICES OR SERVICES THAT REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF COORDINATION WITH FEDERAL AND OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. THIRD THE PROPOSAL RAISES A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT PRIVACY AND SECURITY. BASED ON OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CDT INTEND TO INVOLVE THEIR INFORMATION SECURITY STAFF IN THE ROAD MAP PLANNING PROCESS AND INCORPORATE A NUMBER OF PRIVACY CONTROLS INTO A SINGLE DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION PLATFORM. WELL IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THESE AND OTHER PRIVACY AND SECURITY MEASURES ARE CONTAINED IN THE STATE ONE BUSINESS ANALYSIS THE LEGISLATURE COULD BENEFIT FROM A MORE DELIBERATIVE AND FEDERAL PLANNING PROCESS FOR DIGITAL IDENTIFICATION. THAT ADDRESSES NOT DISPLAYED EVENT STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RISKS AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND WEBER FINANCE I NEED TO SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL AND IT'S NOTHING THAT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU I'M SORRY YOU BROKE UP THERE FOR A FOR A BIT CAN YOU REPEAT THAT. BLACK ONE OF THE FINEST. FINANCES OF THIS PROPOSAL IS NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. OKAY I HAVE A COUPLE OF WHAT POLICY PROBLEM IS A PROPOSAL ATTEMPTING TO RESOLVE. BECAUSE THE- MANAGEMENT USER IDENTIFICATION IS DISPERSED ACROSS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT SYSTEMS THAT THAT USER EXPERIENCE IS VERY DISJOINTED AND FOR THE RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH STATE GOVERNMENT IT DOES NOT GIVE A CONSOLIDATED FEEL ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THE- IS THAT DISBURSEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. BY BEING ABLE TO CENTRALIZE THAT WE BELIEVE WE CAN NOT ONLY DO THE MUCH BETTER AS A STATE ORGANIZATION BUT WE CAN MAINTAIN ITS CURRENT WITH PRIVACY LAWS WITH ANY BEST PRACTICES AND WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. TO A PROVIDES A MUCH SAFER A DIGITAL. ENVIRONMENT RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA. WHAT CALIFORNIANS THAT RECEIVE ANY BASIC SERVICE SUCH AS SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL ARE GETTING HELP WITH HEALTHCARE OR APPLYING FOR A DRIVER'S LICENSE. ESSENTIALLY ALSO BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES. NO WE'RE NOT THIS IS AN OPTIMAL SOLUTION SO THE RESIDENTS CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR A WEBSITE WILL IDENTIFY THE SITES THAT THEY WANT THAT INFORMATION SURE TO. SO IF THEY SIGN UP- ESSENTIALLY IN THIS IDENTITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE CAN PROVE THE IDENTITY OF A HEALTHY PERSON FOR GRASP FOR EXAMPLE. BY THEY CAN SAY THAT THEY ONLY WANT TAX HE SHARED WITH SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS AND CAN CONCERT WE WILL NOW. WORK MORE INFORMATION WE WILL NOT. BE SURE NOW WITH A LITTLE. WITHOUT CONSENT IT'S ALSO AN OPT OUT PROGRAM WHICH STATE ARE SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGED HER MIND AND WOULD LIKE TO WITHDRAW THEY CAN DO THAT ON DEMAND. WHEN THEY CHOOSE TO DO THAT. WHAT THANK YOU WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY PROVIDE THE ID INFORMATION TO FEDERAL IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IF REQUESTED. WE'LL FOLLOW THE DIRECTION OF STATE OR FEDERAL LAW AND ANY EXECUTIVE ORDERS WILL OR OTHER ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU I KNOW ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT.
