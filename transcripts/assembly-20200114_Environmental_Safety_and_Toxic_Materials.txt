WELL HE WAS A SUBSTITUTE. ONE INTRODUCED RACHEL SILVER S. I. L. V. E. R. AND SILVER AS OUR NEW SCIENCE FELLOW HARVARD PHD AND ALL THAT- AND ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY SO A VERY GOOD MATCH I AND WE DO A LOT OF CHEMISTRY HERE AND THERE VERY GLAD TO HAVE HER EXPERTISE. HARM LITERATURE. USE UP SIR WHAT ELSE- SIX MINUTES PER SIDE ARE DIVIDED UP HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DO IT AND WE'RE HEARING JUST THE ONE THEY'LL ASSEMBLY MEMBER RARE SU CHI WITH THAT JOINT AUTHORS BUFFY WAKES UP TO MARY SUE CHEAP PLEASE BEGIN ACTUALLY I WANTED TO ASK FOR YOUR INDULGENCE BECAUSE THE BUCKS NATURE. AND BE IS THAT MAP THAT HAD THE BILL OR HERE YEAH I WANTED TO ASK YOUR INDULGENCE OF PERHAPS A FEW A FEW MORE. FOR THEM TO. CASE MISTER ARAMBULA HAS COME IN AN HOUR AND I. GINA GARCIA WITH THE ARM DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD ARE PRETTY WELL BRIEFED AND- IF THEY GET HERE ON TIME LAST QUESTIONS AND IF THEY DON'T THEY WON'T. THE I DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE- PEOPLE BEING LATE SO WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR WITH ONE MORE WILL HAVE A QUORUM SO PROCEED ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB FOUR NINE FIVE THE TOXIC FREE COSMETICS AT. WHAT THE FIRST. HARD WORKING STAFF- FOR JUST A SECOND WE JUST ARRIVED AT A QUORUM ALL RIGHT EVEN BETTER EVEN BETTER ALL RIGHT- MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL FOR. JUST ALL THE TO ESTABLISH CORN QUIRK HERE ARE CARE MELENDEZ I AM GLAD ARAMBULA PRESENT OUR QUE HAN ARE CAN HEAR CRISTINA GARCIA HOLDEN MATHIS WHAT I TO JETER NOT TWO G. HERE OBERNOLTE. WE HAVE FIVE MEMBERS WE HAVE A QUORUM. I THINK WE JUST NUMBER TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT HAS ALSO ON AT THE SAME TIME. HE HAS THREE COMMITTEE AT THE SAME TIME SOMEBODY MADE A MISTAKE IN THEIR SCHEDULING. BUT WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. SO I- WANTED TO THANK YOUR STAFF FOR ALL OF THE- HARD WORK THAT THEY PUT INTO THIS BILL SINCE OUR FIRST PRESENTATION LAST APRIL. YOU HAVE PROPOSED COMMITTEE OF ANTS AND I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- AND AGAIN THANK THE STAFF FOR- DRAFTING THOSE AMENDMENTS I WANT TO THANK THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT TO. MANY OF WHOM I HAVE HAD TO. OPPORTUNITY INTEL'S SERVE THEIR TIME TO TALK THROUGH THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND I BELIEVE THAT- WE HAVE HEARD THEIR CONCERNS LOUD AND CLEAR AS WELL- THE CONCERNS OF THE COLDER THE COSMETICS MANUFACTURERS THE OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE- MET WITH AND- AND DISCUSSED. THEIR CONCERNS SINCE LAST APRIL WE'VE HEARD THESE CONCERNS LOUD AND CLEAR I WANTED TO MAKE MY COMMITMENT CLEAR THAT TO THAT. WE ARE I AM COMMITTED ARE FOR OMITTED. TO ALIGN THIS BILL WITH THE STANDARDS- AS IT RELATES TO COST A TOXIC CHEMICALS IN COSMETICS BUT TO ALIGN THEM WITH EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS- THAT IS- THE CLEAR MESSAGE WE HEARD NOT ONLY FROM MEMBERS HAD EXPRESSED CONCERNS BUT ALSO FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT. THE KARAMAT- PRODUCTS- COUNCIL THEY ARE CLEARLY INDICATED THAT THEY WANTED A GLOBAL STANDARD AND SO IT IS OUR INTENT AND COMMIT. WORK ORDER THOSE. WILL STANDARDS AS IT RELATES TO THE REGULATIONS OF TOXIC CHEMICALS IN COSMETICS. THIS BILL AS YOU KNOW WE WILL BAND COSMETICS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CONTAIN THIRTEEN TOXIC CHEMICALS WELL KNOWN AND WELL ESTABLISHED BY THE SCIENCE TO CAUSE CANCER REPRODUCTIVE HARM OR HORMONE DISRUPTION. THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE WELL KNOWN TO ALL OF US THEY INCLUDE CHEMICALS SUCH AS LEAD MERCURY ASBESTOS FORM OUT HIDE AND OTHERS. THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS FACTORS SO WELL KNOWN THAT MOST PEOPLE'S REACTION WHEN THEY FIRST HEAR ABOUT THIS BILL IS AREN'T THESE TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE READY AND- UNFORTUNATELY RECENT DISCOVERIES OF COSMETIC PRODUCTS ON STORE SHELVES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HIGHLIGHT THE FAILURE OF EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT CONSUMERS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN- WHAT WAS IN FACT EXPRESSED AS WITH THE ONE IN SALT FUNDS COSMETICS PRODUCTS BEING SOLD IN POP. RETAIL CHAINS CLAIRE IS AND JUST. TO CHANGE THAT I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH AS A FATHER OF A TEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. THESE SEARCHES ARE TARGETING THEIR PRODUCTS FOR GIRLS TEENS AND TWEENS PRODUCTS LIKE POWDER MAKEUP CONTAINING ASBESTOS WE ALSO KNOW OF THE- HI THE. PUBLICIZED AND WELL DOCUMENTED CASES OF OTHER PRODUCTS LIKE JOHNSON AND JOHNSON BABY POWDER THAT HAS BEEN FOUND TO CONTAIN ASBESTOS WE HAVE ALSO HAD INCIDENTS OF FACIAL CREAMS CONTAINING MERCURY AT OF INDUCED- COMMAS AMONG CONSUMERS- AND CALIFORNIA EN EL THAT HAVE APPLIED THESE. COSMETICS TO THEIR SKIN. INTENDING FORMALDEHYDE WHICH HAS A RECENT STUDY HAS BEEN TIED TO A HIGHER RISK OF BREAST CANCER ESPECIALLY AMONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN. SO THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR ON THE HARMFUL NATURE OF THESE CHEMICALS THESE COSMETICS CONTAINING THESE THIRTEEN CHEMICALS ARE A READY BANNED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION. AND SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH THIS BILL IS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO HAVE THE SAME RIGHT THE RIGHT TO THE SAME PROTECT. THE STAINED TOXIC FREE COSMETICS AS THOSE ARE READY BEINGS IN EUROPE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WITH SIMILAR CONSUMER PROTECTION. I AM UP TO TEAM UP ON THIS EFFORT TO. NINETY FIVE WITH THE OUR JOINT AUTHORED ASSEMBLY WOMAN BUFFY WORKS IN A LIKE TO TURN OVER TO MS WICKS THANK YOU. NUMBER NOW KEEP MY REMARKS SHORT AND WE DON'T ATTEND. BUT YOU KNOW I COME HERE IS A LEGISLATOR BUT ALSO SOME I COVERS. AS YOU THE STATE STARTS OF SAID WOMEN IS ON AVERAGE SIXTEEN PRODUCTS TODAY- I WASH MY DAUGHTER'S HAIR WITH YOU KNOW CHILDREN'S SHAMPOO- I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE A SCIENTIST AT THE SUPERMARKET TO READ THE LABELS TO UNDERSTAND THAT I'M STATE. I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON THE GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT OUR CITIZENS FROM HARMFUL COME UP WITH THAT IN MANY OTHER SICK PATIENTS OFTEN THIS PROCESS AS WE UNDER AN ACT OF A SCIENTIFIC BACK ON TO- IN ORDER TO THAT ROLE MINUTE AND CLEARLY. ALL RIGHT SO ON THE WITNESSES HAVE YOU AGREED HOW MUCH OF THE SIX MINUTES EACH WILL TAKE. ALL RIGHT OUT. DO I NEED TO TIME YOU AND I CAN TIME YOU INDIVIDUALLY IF YOU WILL TELL ME HOW MUCH TIME YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA TAKE. IT SHOULD BE A MINUTE. MINUTE THIRTY GOT IT OKAY ANYONE ELSE. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI AND FEW WHACKS MANY MISTER BASIC PLAN AND I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR BLOCKING FELIZ AS THE WHITE REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE ORGANIZATION THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR WORK IS TO HELP. TO CREATE A WORLD THAT'S BUT FOR BLACK MOMMAS THE BABIES THE LARGER COMMITTEE. BECAUSE YOU'RE SHORT ON TIME I'M GOING TO CONSTRUED TO THE POINT MANY BEAUTY PRODUCTS THAT HAVE HARMFUL CHEMICALS SUCH AS LEAD MERCURY FROM I HAD SHOW UP AN ECONOMICALLY FRIENDLY STORES PREYED ON FAMILIES WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THE WAY TOO OFTEN LOW CON THEY CAN MEET THE COLOR THE BRIDGE ACTION ON ISSUES WE PART. THE FACT IS THE BLACK WOMEN ARE THE MOST DIE FROM BREAST CANCER WE'RE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE LOW- BIRTH LOW BIRTH BABIES IN VERY LOW BIRTH AB AND THE RISE IN ABOUT INFERTILITY ALL IT. ISSUES AND DIRECT THE CHEMICALS BEING BE ACTED THIS BILL. EVERY RELEASED. IT SHOULD DOUBLE. PERCENT HIGHER RISK OF GETTING BREAST CANCER. THIS CALL IT WOULD USE A CHEMICAL STREET- SOMETHING OUT A THREE OUT OF FOUR BLACK WOMEN HAVE YOU. EVEN WE ACTIVELY TRY TO PICK SAFER PRODUCTS WITH SAFE INGREDIENTS IT IS. BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLE ADVERTISING NOW ALL OF THE INGREDIENTS ARE ON THE LABEL ARE NOT HAVING A GRADUATE DEGREE IN CHEMISTRY. YES CALIFORNIA'S HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TAKE THE BURDEN OUR FAMILIES WHO ARE TAKING ALL OF THE ARREST AND NONE OF THE REWARD FOR. BOTH OF THESE CHEMICALS AND PUTTING IT BACK ON THE COMPANIES. NO CAN MAKE PC PRODUCTS WITHOUT PUTTING THEIR KIDS AT HEART. THANK YOU. THANKS VERY MUCH AND THAT WAS A MINUTE THIRTY SECOND I HAD. HELLO MY NAME IS POLLY MARSHALL AND I'M A BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR AFTER MY DIAGNOSIS AT AGE FIFTY TWO I HAD THREE SURGERIES THREE MONTHS OF CHEMOTHERAPY AND FIVE WEEKS AND DAILY RADIATION TREATMENTS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU WHY A BEFORE NINETY FIVE IS SO TERRIBLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO OTHER SURVIVORS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ONE OUT OF EVERY EIGHT WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER IN HER LIFETIME. AND FIFTY THOUSAND WOMEN WILL DIE FROM THIS DISEASE EVERY YEAR. IN THE UNITED STATES ALONG. TEN OUT OF THE THIRTEEN CHEMICALS THAT WOULD BE BANNED BY A BEFORE NINETY FIVE FROM BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS IN OUR STATE ARE DIRECTLY LINKED TO BREAST CANCER. PASSING A BEFORE NINETY FIVE WILL REMOVE ONE MAJOR SOURCE OF WOMEN'S ONGOING EXPOSURE TO SOME OF THE MOST TOXIC SUBSTANCES IN ON EARTH. THIS IS NOT A HYPOTHETICAL ISSUE WOMEN LIKE ME LIVING WITH BREAST CANCER LIVE IN DAILY FEAR OF REOCCURRENCE OF THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE. COMPANY IT SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE TO USE CHEMICALS WITH KNOWN LINKS TO BREAST CANCER IN BEAUTY AND PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY ARE SELLING. EXACT WITHOUT THESE CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS. AB FOR NINETY FIVE WOULD PUT AN END TO THIS DOUBLE STANDARD. PLEASE PROTECT ME AND OTHER BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. PLEASE PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. PLEASE VOTE YES TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THAT THREE AND A HALF MINUTES ALTOGETHER SO MEN AND A HALF FOR THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS OUR THREE SPEAKERS. YOUR TAKEN MY SPOT SHE'S ME TWO AND A HALF MINUTES FOR THE LAST. SPEAKER TO HAPPEN GET OKAY I'LL BE VERY BRIEF- MY NAME IS SUCH A SERVER IN A SENIOR SCIENTIST WITH THE WGA HOLD THE PHD ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY VIA MIDDLE WORKING GROUP. GO AHEAD THE LOCALS PROHIBITED BY THIS BILL BECAUSE SIGNIFICAN ARM TO HELP- SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM ASBESTOS IS A WELL KNOWN CARCINOGEN THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO ANY TYPE OF SPECIFIED- ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE. GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IT DOESN'T RESURGENT POTENT POTENT GEN- IN HER TREATMENTS IT HAS BEEN LINKED TO HAIR LOSS RASHES BLISTERS AND LOSS OF TASTE AND SMELL MERCURY CERTAIN BARELY HARMS THE NERVOUS SYSTEM AND CAN AFFECT THE DEVELOPING CHILD DURING PREGNANCY. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN SIXTY POISONINGS AND- FOR NHà RELATED TO THE USE OF SKIN LIGHTENING CREAMS CONTAINING MERCURY. BALLOTS ARE POTENT ALLERGENS AND CONSTRUCTORS AND CAN HARM REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS AND AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT DURING PREGNANCY. AND THE CDC HAS DETECTED- DIE BEAUTIFUL AT VALLEY IN 96% OF PEOPLE SAMPLED SHOWING WIDESPREAD. AND CONTINUOUS- THE PUBLIC HEALTH IS CURRENTLY JEOPARDIZED BY THE LACK OF CONSTRAINTS ON THE CHEMICALS PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. IN THE US ARE THE BANDITS COME IN THE WE ARE BUT YOU DO THIS. YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BONNIE GANG AND THE DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY OF UTICA. COSMETICS COMPANY WITH A MISSION TO GET THE FOR PRODUCTS INTO THE HANDS OF EVERYONE. BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRODUCT. THEIR BODY YOUR HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT DOES LICENSE THEY WON A COMPANY HAS FORMULATED WITHOUT OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED INGREDIENTS INCLUDING THE THIRTEEN INGREDIENTS INCLUDED- FOR INCLUDED BAND RESTRICTED IN THIS BILL. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE SAFE INGREDIENTS THAT PERFORM JUST AS WELL AS THESE INGREDIENTS IN THE SPELL AND ARE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL. THE GROWTH OF OUR COMPANY AND OTHERS LIKE US DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS POSSIBLE AND PROFITABLE TO FORMULATE WITHOUT THESE INGREDIENTS AND WE ASK THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU. ACT ALL RIGHT. MY NAME'S LARA THE HEN I'M WITH CALPERS AND WE'RE AT CᄑC ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS FOR THIS BILL AND THAT REALLY HAVE A CAME ABOUT BECAUSE- WE AT BABOONS- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN REALLY HIGH LEVELS OF ASBESTOS IT AIRS MAKEUP PRODUCTS MARKETED TO YOUNG WOMEN AND UNFORTUNATELY I'M EVEN WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS TO THE ATTENTION OF CLAIRE'S INTO THE FTA THEY WERE UNABLE TO DO MUCH ABOUT IT AND THE FDA SAID THEY LOOKED THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT. IMMERSED IN THIS AREA. AND THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO. MANDATORY THANK OUR PANEL. AND THAT REALLY EXPOSES WHAT WE NEED TO THIS SPELL WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW TO PROTECT CONSUMERS- SO THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S NO MORE- HIGH LEVELS OF EXPOSURE TO DEPRESS CHEMICALS. LIKE LEAD AND STATE PERSPECTIVES IN FACE POWDERS- AND YOU KNOW CANCER CAUSING INFERTILITY CAUSING FROM ALL THE HATE AND OTHER CHEMICALS IN HAIR PRODUCTS. AND SO WE BANKING INFO THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT COM BEFORE I CALL UP THE OUR MISSION I JUST LIKE TO SAY. WELL FOLKS ARE HERE THAT THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE PLEDGED. THAT WE WANT TO HAVE ALL. THAT YOU THINK THAT CAN BE SOLD IN THE TWENTY EIGHT T. U. COUNTRIES CAN BE SOLD IN CAL OR NHà. THE REAL NICE THAT THAT MAY READ. MORE WORK ON THE BILL AND THAT'S FINE BUT- YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ALMOST YEAR ON THIS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET OUT A BILL. PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH IT'S NOT JUST AN IDEA SOMEWHERE SO I I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO THAT- SO LET ME CALL UP THE OPPOSITION IF YOU FIVE CAN MOVE- AND THEN CALL YOU UP LATER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS PARTICULARLY.

THANK YOU JIM WINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT NOW pOPPOSITION AND YOU WILL HAVE SIX AND A HALF MINUTES BECAUSE THE OTHER GROUP JUST WENT OVER THIRTY SECONDS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL I WANT TO FIRST START OFF BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR. THE MEMBERS OF THE STM COMMITTEE AND THE AUTHORS- WE THANK YOU GUYS FOR ALL THE WORK YOU'VE DONE THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND I THINK THAT IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT. BASED ON THE CHAIRS MEN'S SIDE OF THE WORLD PRODUCT WILL FULLY AND STRICTLY ALIGN US WITH THE E. U. GIVES US A LOT OF. EFFORT BUT I DO STAND HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE TODAY A AND I WANNA THROUGH THE REED IS WHAT WE ARE OPPOSED. AND WHY AREN'T OPPOSE- I ONE OF WITH WHY WE AREN'T OPPOSED AND WE AREN'T OPPOSED BECAUSE ANY OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES WANT YOU AND- ONLY. YOU HAVE THE- CHANCE. IT AND EIGHT. FIVE. OUR OPPOSITION TO PEACE MAIL CHEMICAL BANDS- IN THE MISGUIDED APPROACH OF HAVING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PLACE TO BAN CHEMICALS ON A ONE ONE BY ONE BASIS WITHOUT. RISK ASSESSMENTS ARE WITHOUT SCIENCE. AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NEEDS HAS MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD SINCE WE'VE MET WITH ALL OF YOU GUYS- THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT AND CREATED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE SUPPORTERS OF THIS. ONE GREEN CHEMISTRY TO WORK BETTER. WE DO TOO AND I THINK THEY'RE AFTER IT'S UNDER WAY TO MAKE THAT PROCESS. BETTER SIDE STATE OUR SUPPORT FOR HAVING THAT. PLUS BETTER- YOU HEARD THE SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL TODAY ALSO TALK ABOUT YOU PRODUCTS AND HOW- HOW WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE SAME PROTECTIONS AS A YOU AND WE AGREE BUT THE BILL THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU FALLS SHORT. AND AT THIS POINT- I WOULD LIKE TO HAND THIS OVER TO JAY ANSEL WHO IS A SCIENTIST FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNSEL TO RUN THROUGH. THOSE COMPONENTS. SO CHAIRMAN WORK BETTER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY- COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY TOXIC MATERIALS A GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M JAN SELVES PRESIDENT OF COSMETIC PROGRAMS AT THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL. PIECE PC IS THE LEADING NATIONAL TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING OVER SIX HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING. ONE HUNDRED THAT EITHER CALL CALIFORNIA HOME OR HAVE A PRESENCE HERE. WE CANNOT BOARD CERTIFIED TALKS JUST. THIRD BY THE UNITED ZERO BY ALL BIOLOGY AS A EUROPEAN REGISTER TOXICOLOGIST AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OUR OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR NINETY FIVE WHILE THE STATED INTENT IS TO A LINE CALIFORNIA WITH CURRENT EUROPEAN COSMETIC REGULATIONS AS DRAFTED AB FORTY FIVE FAILS TO DO SO. THE CPC IS OWES TO AB FOUR NINETY FIVE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. AB FOUR NINE FIVE SECTION E. PER PERMITTING THE PRESENCE OF TRACE MATERIALS SHOULD APPLY TO THE ENTIRE BILL CONSISTENT WITH THE E. U. A BEFORE NINETY FIVES PROPOSED TO TRACE EXEMPTION. A BY A DIFFERING FROM THE E. U. IN SELECTIVELY ADOPTING ONLY PARTS OF THE E. U. REGULATION. INTRODUCES MAJOR QUESTIONS ON IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT A BEFORE NINETY FIVE. NEAR THE E. U. PERMITTING THE PRESENCE OF PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES WHICH IS NOT INTENTIONALLY ADDED. RESIDENT SMALL CONCENTRATIONS AND TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE ONE CONFIRMING ABOUT CONFORMING TO CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES. AND WE NOTICED ONCE APPLY TO ALL TRACES AS IT DOES IN THE E. U. SECTION DE TO PERMITTING- HE HA TO SET THE MINIMUS CONCENTRATIONS WOULD NO LONGER BE NECESSARY. PC PC ALSO RECOMMENDS HARMONIZING TERMINOLOGY. IN ORDER TO AVOID CONFUSION. THE E. U. REGULATIONS SPEAKS TO PERMITTED OR PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES. WHEREAS FOR NINETY FIVE INSTEAD USES THE LANGUAGE ADULTERATED WHICH IS A TERM OF ART USED IN THE US FOOD AND DRUG. AND COSMETIC ACT. PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COMPANIES WORK WITH AN EMPLOYEE THOUSANDS OF CHEMISTS TOXICOLOGISTS BIOLOGIST ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS AND OTHER EXPERTS TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY OF THIS COSMETICS. AND THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS INDUSTRY HAS A SHARED INTEREST WITH CONSUMERS REGULATORS AND POLICY MAKERS TO PROVIDE SAFE HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND IS DEDICATED TO FINDING COLLABORATIVE SOLUTIONS AND POLICIES GROUNDED IN SCIENCE AS A BEFORE NINETY FIVE INTENSE. HOWEVER INTRO A TRANSPARENT THOUGHTFUL AND PREDICTABLE PROCESS CAN BE DESCRIBED WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU OPPOSE AB FOR NINETY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR RAZA MEASURED. TESTIMONY OF OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ADAMANTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH PC PC AND- OUR POSE BUT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR THANK YOU. THE COOKING UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE FIGURES CREATORS ASSOCIATION TEAM COMMENTS WITHOUT A MANY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE CORRIDOR COMMITTEE. THANK YOU DON CAP KEEP THANK YOU CAP CAN ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY CESSATION. SEEM TO AIRLINES FOR THE COMMENTS MADE LOOKS FORWARD TO FURTHER WORK THANK YOU. SHARE MEMBERS CONGESTED WITH AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL OF FOR THE REASONS STATED THAT APPRECIATE THE WORK SO FAR THE FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU. DAN CALL OFF WITH THE- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INDEPENDENT COSMETIC MANUFACTURERS AND DISTRIBUTORS- WE'LL MINOR COMMENTS WITH- PCP. AND WOULD LIKE THE AMENDMENTS MAN THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THEN. TO THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI BOB SPECIFIC- COMMENT WAS BROUGHT UP ABOUT- SEPARATING OUT I BELIEVE IT'S LEAD IN THIS BEST DOES FROM OUR E. U. REGULATIONS ARE YOU WILLING TO MAKE A CHANGE THERE TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT WITH THE E. U. I AM FULLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YOUR STAFF TO. ALIGN IT WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARDS ARM BUT AS WE HAVE DISCUSSED YOU KNOW THERE'D WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIGURE OUT. IN A SPEECH IN SITUATIONS WHERE FOUR EGGS WITH ESPECIALLY IS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES- IN FORCE TO- THE STANDARDS IN IN IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ALIGN OURSELVES BUT AGAIN I THINK THERE. THE INTENT- AND MY COMMITMENT IS TO. ALIGN THE STANDARD SO THAT WHAT. IT IS- IS SOLD IN THE EUROPEAN UNION CAN BE SOLD AGAIN CALIFORNIA RIGHT AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE- PARTICIPATE IN THE GLOBAL STANDARD NOW. THE OTHER QUESTION YOU MENTIONED A WAREHOUSE SETTING A MINIMUM. OUR UNDERSTANDING IN FOR INCORRECT WE CAN DISCUSS THAT LATER IS THAT DIFFERENT COUNTRIES DO SET THAT DIFFERENTLY. ARKHAM SO IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME RESEARCH TO FIGURE OUT ARE WE SHOULD COME UP WITH THAT. AND HOW WE DO TO FIND IT IF THE E. REALLY DOES HAVE A UNIFORM. ADEFINITION I WILL CERTAINLY WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PUT IN THE BILL. ARE AS WE BELIEVE AT THE MOMENT THEY DON'T HAVE A UNIFORM DEFINITION OF WHAT IT TO MINIMUS AMOUNT IS- AND IT'S DONE BY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND WELL TO FIX SOMETHING THAT. RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE REASON I HAVE WE ARE INVOLVED FOR INCORRECT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT IF YOU HAVE BETTER WRITE THIS BELL. TO LET US KNOW AND WE WILL TAKE A LOOK AT SO THERE MAY BE A BETTER WAY TO WRITE IT- I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT BANNING CHEMICALS ONE BY ONE THE WHOLE WITHOUT DOING SCIENCE. THE WHOLE REASON FOR WITH THE STANDARD IS. THIS IS TRADITIONAL INDUSTRY IN EUROPE. THEY KNOW THIS BETTER THAN WE DO BETTER THAN THE FTA AND FRANKLY GREEN CHEMISTRY IS KINDA CONSTIPATED. AT ANY THAT JUST CAME OUT BUT. IT REALLY IS OUR INTENTION TO USE SCIENCE AND THAT'S WHY I ASKED FOR THE U. STANDARDS AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS. OUR IN LINE CERTAINLY WITH THE INTENTION OF THE LEGISLATURE NOT TO BAN THINGS ONE BY ONE WITHOUT GOOD SCIENCE. THE WHOLE THING HERE IS TO USE THE E. U. STANDARD AND I THINK THAT'S VERY APPROPRIATE- I NOW LIKE TO OPEN THIS UP. A FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE. OUR COMMITTEE. BECAUSE WE GOT ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS BEFORE THIS CAME UP. LAST YEAR WE GOT THEM AND AS A RESULT OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SAID YOU AND I WERE WILLING TO DELAY THE BAIL. THE COMMITTEE IS JUST THE CHAIR COMMITTEE DEPENDS UPON MEMBERS BRINGING UP THEIR CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHAT THESE MEMBERS DO. AND WE'RE A MUCH STRONGER COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF IT. ALL RIGHT MADAM VICE CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I. I APPRECIATE WHAT THE TWO OF YOU ARE TRYING TO DO AND I THINK IT IS WARRANTED FOR SURE- I WAS TALKING WITH MY STAFF EARLIER ABOUT THE FACT THAT- WOMEN CLEARLY PARTICIPATE MORE IN THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY THAN MEN DO SO WE'RE PUTTING THINGS. ON THEM EXCEPT MAYBE FOR YOU OUT. SAME AMOUNT OF TIME I DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW WE ARE PUTTING THESE THINGS ON OUR FACES OUR BODIES ADDED IT ON A DAILY RATE SOMETIMES TWICE A DAY. AND SO ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW SOMEONE SAY WELL IT'S SUCH A REALLY NOT VERY HARMFUL WELL. THAT'S TRUE. PER USAGE BUT OVER TIME. I DON'T KNOW DO WE KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT GETS INTO OUR SYSTEM AND THEN CAUSES A PROBLEM SO I DON'T DISMISS. ON THIS SUGGESTION THAT YOU'RE MAKING HERE TODAY WITH THIS BILL BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION AND SAYING I DON'T KNOW. THAT WE NEED TO GO QUITE THIS FAR CAN WORK AND JUSTICE IN SOME WAYS IT SEEM TO FIT- OUR NEEDS HERE SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TAKE SOME MEASUREMENTS NOT SURE HOW FAR YOU GOING TO GO WITH THAT SOUNDS YOUR NEGOTIATIONS. SO I'M GONNA HOLD OFF TODAY BUT I DO REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN GET. A PLATE FOR EVERYBODY IT TO PORT OF THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW- I CERTAINLY NOT PUTTING A DISADVANTAGE FOR. SELLING UNITED STATES IS NOT ONE. HELP FARM. SO THAT ME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR OUR NEXT QUESTIONER. MISTER MISTER ROUTE OBERNOLTE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION THE YOU AND I'VE BEEN HAVING ABOUT THE COMMITTEE BE AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL SO IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THE NEW SECTION E. THAT'S BEING ADDED SAYS AROUND PHRASE FOR TIME IF ANY COSMETIC PRODUCT MADE THREE GOOD MANUFACTURING. IS INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH THIS PART COULD CONTAIN CHEMICAL THAT IS NOT INTENTIONALLY ADDED IN TECHNICALLY UNAVOIDABLE THE CHEMICAL SHOULD NOW BECAUSE BUT TO BE CONSIDERED ADULTERATED OKAY SO MY QUESTION IS GOOD MANUFACTURING PROCESSES- THAT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT I AM FAMILIAR WITH IS THAT A TERM OF ART LISA WE'VE DECIDED TO TAKE. AS WE GO FORWARD AND JUST SAY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES SO THAT WE DON'T OF YOU KNOW. WORKING MANY YEARS IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO COME UP WITH CONSENSUS WE OFTEN FOUND THE BEST THING TO DO IS TO TAKE OUT THE ADJECTIVES. UP FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT SO JUST JUST TO BE CLEAR SO THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT DELETES THE WORD GOOD WELL WILL I DON'T KNOW IS IT IN THE CURRENT AMENDMENT OR WOULD SOMETHING WE'RE GOING TO ASK. LATER YEAH I GOT HAD. THE REASON EIGHT USE THE WORDS GOOD MANUFACTURING IS BECAUSE THAT IS WITHIN YOUR REFLECTION OF- ARTICLE SEVENTEEN IN THE U. COSMETIC REGULATION WHICH IS THE ARTICLE SEVENTEEN IS THE SAFE HARBOR PROVISION AND THAT RIGHT IN THAT REGULATION- THE LANGUAGE IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE NOT VERBATIM. THE ARTICLE SEVENTEEN BUT GOOD MANUFACTURING IS A REFLECTION OF THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED IN ARTICLE SEVENTEEN- HOWEVER BECAUSE DOCTOR QUIRK JUST SAID THAT'S NOT DEFINING THAT'S CONFUSING FOR CALIFORNIA LAW- WERE- MEETING THE WORD GOOD AND JUST MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND IF IT'S NOT PERFECT THE AUTHOR CAN CONTINUE TO REFINE HOW THIS PROVISION AS RIGHT. AS IT'S PAST OF THE CAN. THE WORD GOOD IS NOT. THANK RIGHT UP I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT. I GUESS PROCESS SO YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE DEFINING A LIST OF THIRTEEN CHEMICALS THAT WERE SAYING IT THAT IS FOR SURE WINNER PERCENT NOT PERMISSIBLE TO HAVE IN COSMETICS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEN WE ARE EMPOWERING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ON THEIR OWN THROUGH REGULATION IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY MORE CHEMICALS THAT MIGHT NOT BE APPROPRIATE SO TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE A STRANGE WAY. SPLITTING THE BABY IT EITHER WE ARE. EXERCISE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THESE ARE THE CHEMICALS THAT THE SCIENCE SUPPORTS BANNING WAR WE ARE POINTING TO THE CALIFORNIA PART OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAYING YOU GUYS THE EXPERT YOU DECIDE BUT TO DO BOTH AT THE SAME TIME SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME I WONDERED IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN YOUR REASONING ON THAT. CERTAINLY SO WE HEARD. V. OPPOSITION THAT. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. I WOULD SUPPORT A GLOBAL STANDARD. AND SO THAT'S WHY SUPPORT MIGHT BE A LITTLE STRONG BUTTON IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT PREFERRED. AND SO. THAT THAT IS- AND THAT IS MY INTENT AND WITH THE CHAIRED STRONG SUGGESTION THAT WE BASE IT ON THE GLOBAL STANDARDOF THE EUROPEAN UNION STANDARD ARM. THAT IS WHY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THAT LANGUAGE AS A- THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANT EXPLAINED IN A WAS BASED ON- THE LANGUAGE AND- THE EUROPEAN UNION REGULATE AN ARM. BECAUSE WE ARE BASED ON THE STATE ENTERED AND NOT BASE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WITH WHO IN THIS CASE WERE AGREEING WITH A. WITH THE REPRESENTED FROM THE PERSONAL CARE PROP. THAT WE WERE NOT TAKING A CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL APPROACH BUT RATHER WE ARE BASING THE BAN ON WHAT IS THE SCIENCE ACCORDING TO THE EUROPE UNION AND SO A LOT OF THAT SAME LOGIC YOU KNOW FOR EIGHTY POTENTIAL FUTURE CHEMICAL. AND ARMED AND I SPOKE WITH GARCIA ABOUT THAT MY COMMITMENT TO THAT- ANY FUTURE CHEMICALS DAD WOULD BE STRICTLY LIMITED TO THOSE THAT ARE BANNED BY THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW THE SITE AND SPEAKS. UP APPROACH TO THAT TO THAT WE ARE. ADOPT SO IT'S NOT UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IT'S NOT UP TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT IT'S UP TO THE- EUROPEAN UNION. AND RIGHT IN THAT AMENDMENT- WE'VE TAKEN OUT THE LANGUAGE WITH A LIST OF CHEMICALS AND WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT THEY CAN ADD SOMETHING IF THE EUROPEAN UNION HAS ADDED IT. BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS THING FROZEN IN TIME AND HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE EVERY TIME THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION BUT HE'S TAKING AN AMENDMENT WHICH WILL SAY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSTRICT LEE ADD ONLY THINGS WHICH THE EUROPEAN UNION. HAVE AT. SO AS I SAID. ARE YOU GOOD ALTHOUGH I WOULD LIKE TO ARE COMPLETELY TRUSTS WHAT THE U. DOES AND THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE EXIST TO EXERCISE OUR OWN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OVER THOSE AND FIVE SPEAKING FOR MYSELF I WOULD PREFER TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT COME BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN THEIR ADDITIONAL CHEMICALS- THAT THE BAND SO I REALIZE THAT THIS IS ALL A WORK IN PROGRESS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT. YOU JUST CHECK I FIND RESPONSE HERE SO ANOTHER. GARCIA WAS TO OUR TO WORK ON AN AMENDMENT TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A OPEN STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. WHERE STAKEHOLDERS WHO'D BE HEARD THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC- HEALTH- REGULATORY PROCESS- YOU KNOW THAT THEY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WITH TWO WAY AND SO I KNOW THAT THAT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE BUT NOW AT AT THE VERY LEAST AND IN THE SPIRIT OF A- OF OPENED GOOD GOVERNANCE THAT WE WANT TO WORK ON AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD PROVIDE FOR A PROCEDURE TO ALLOW STAKEHOLDERS TO WAYNE FRIEND TO POTENTIAL. CHEMICALS TO BE BAD THAT'S OKAY THANK YOU THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER. MR MURATSUCHI YOU'VE STATED OUT A LOT OF COMMITMENTS I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THEM IN IN BLACK AND WHITE WITHIN THE BILL ITSELF- ARE YOU ALSO PLANNING ANY SAFEGUARDS IN CASE THE E. U. CHANGES ITS PROCESS ON WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE WAY THEY'RE DOING THEIR SYSTEM. MY MAKES SENSE BUT THEY CAN ALWAYS CHANGE HOW THEY'RE DOING THINGS- SO I THINK WE NEED TO SAFEGUARD PROVISION AND THAT- IF THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT IT'S GOING SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS IN ON THE OTHER SIDE IT'S YOU KNOW. WE'RE WE'RE FOLLOWING THE E. U. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT GOING OVER THERE BETWEEN THE ROYAL FAMILY BREAKING UP AND EVERYTHING ELSE SO. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT WITH NEXT SO I THINK- MISTRAL REALTY DOES HAVE A FEW POINTS ABOUT ENSURING THAT THERE IS A PROVISION WHERE THINGS CAN COME BACK THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S WHILE. CERTAINLY AND- ACTING. SO AND SO UNTIL I SEE IT ALL IN WRITING I'M GONNA HOLD OFF ON MY VOTE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. WE ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT. IF THERE IS A CONCERN. CERTAINLY YOU COULD BRING UP THE BELL. SAME WE CAN NO LONGER CONTRAST THE E. U. AND THAT SO THAT'S ALREADY OPEN. CURRENT RULES. TO SHARED THE BILL AND. WELL I'LL HEAR YOUR BILL I GUARANTEE IT. OKAY THE OTHER QUESTIONS. IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS WE CAN PROBABLY CALL THE ROLL AND GET THE VOTE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA GUY HAD I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF THE CHAIRMAN AND THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING. ANA ORDERS LEE. AND TAKING IN A LOT OF OUR REQUEST SERIOUSLY ALONG THE WAY AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE NOT IN A- FINISH PROCESS AND I APPRECIATE THE OTHER SEVEN SIXTEEN TO WORK WITH ALL OF US INCLUDING MY OFFICE AND- TRIED TO BE ENGAGED IN. THE CHURCH COME IN TO BRING THIS BACK AND WE NEED TO AT SOME POINT WHEN INFANTS BATHHOUSE SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMITMENTS. I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE CONFUSION ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND SO I WILL HAVE MAYBE I COULD RESTATE WHAT I THINK THAT IS. AND THEN ONE MORE ITEM THOUGH THAT. DESPITE UP BY THE OPPOSITION AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY RESPONSE FROM. ON THE OTHER MAYBE HE ONCE BEFORE I LIST THAT STUFF. TALK ABOUT TH THEIR CONCERN ABOUT ADULTERATED VERSUS PROHIBITED IN THAT LINE AND IF THERE. IS A SENSE THAT HAPPENED OR IS THERE PURPOSE FOR THAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT ITEM PLEASE. SO THE ADULTERATED LANGUAGE COMES FROM THE SERMON LAW THE EXISTING LAW. AND SO ON THIS BILL IS. BUILDING UPON THE EXISTING LAW- AND IT- IDENTIFIED THESE THIRTEEN BECAUSE- IT TOXIC CHEMICALS. TO BE. IN A WAY ANY RESIDENTS INTENTIONAL INCLUSION OF THESE THIRTEEN TOXIC CHEMICALS INTO- A COSMETIC WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE OUT ALL TRADED UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW SO THAT IS WHERE THE TERM ADULTERATED CONCERT. AND SO WHAT. WAS YOUR INTENTION ALL ALONG TO THEN USE ULTRA ADULTERATED AND MAKE IT OPENS TO THE CRIMINAL. SIDE OF THINGS. V. S. SHERMAN LAW ALLOWS FOR BOTH A CIVIL AS WELL AS A CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT- BUT YES THE THAT THIS BILL DOES. OF A FOR THE SAKE OF CONSUMER PROTECTION- DOES CALL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO REFER ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE SHERMAN LAW TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. AND FOR YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE MEDICS AND IN OTHER AREAS OF THE SHERMAN LAW PLANS LIKE THEM JUST NOW LEARNING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC ITEMS I APOLOGIZE THAT I'M NINE THIRTY WE HAD ALREADY HAD A PRETTY THOROUGH DISCUSSION ON IT. I DO FEEL LIKE I NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT- THAT. ARE THEY. THE SIMILARITY APPLY TO ANYTHING IN THE COSMETICS INDUSTRY OR IS THIS SOMETHING YOUR BRAIN INTO THIS INDUSTRY OR- CAN YOURSELF OR MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE. WELL. SURE A AS THE COMEDIAN ELSE'S. CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE. ON THE BASIC PILLARS OF- EXISTING LAWS A RELATES TO COSMETIC REGULATIONS ARE V. S. S. TO STATE LAWS IS ONE THE AYE THE SHERMAN LAW- AND SO- AND THE OTHER BEING THE SAFER COSMETICS ACT- BUT- IT THE LEADING LAW AS IT RELATES TO ADULTERATED COSMETICS IS THE SHERMAN LAW AND SO. AS. EXPLAINED AND ON PAGES TO AND THREE AND FOUR OF FOR THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL IS A IS NOT JUST A WHOLESALE CREATING NEW LAW BUT IT'S BUT IT'S- EXPANDING UPON EXISTING LAW TO STRENGTHEN THE OIL UNDER EXISTING LAW FOR THE SECOND CONSUMER PROTECTION. I ADDED- FOR ANY OF MY MRS WITH NO WAIT A SECOND. BEFORE WE GET TO THAT- CRISTINA YOU SATISFIED WITH THE ANSWER YOU'VE HEARD OR DO YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS. I HAVE A DIVISIONAL QUESTIONS. I'M JUST TRYING TO PROCESS THE THIS WITH THE TH BUT WITH THAT ACTUALLY MEANS. AND IN FAIRNESS- I SAW THIS YOUNG LADY HERE ME CAN SHE- SELECT YES IT'S OBVIOUS I'M CERTAIN IF. YOU COULD ASK HER A QUESTION GO AHEAD. PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR TAKE NOT AT THE SAME QUESTION SURE. AND SO THE SHERMAN LAW AND ALREADY DOES COVER BECAUSE MEDICS AND IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX- THERE WAS A LAW PASSED THAT EMPOWERS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WHEN IT COMES TO COSMETIC THAT HOT THERE ARE ADULTERY TO IT'S THAT ARE DANGEROUS INJURIOUS TO. TO US- AND SO THIS IS MEANT TO MERIT THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS THAT THE FDA HAS. AN AND- WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING WITH EIGHTY FOUR NINETY FIVE IS TO AMEND THIS GERMAN LAW TO CLARIFY THAT. ANY PRODUCTS INCLUDING THESE INGREDIENTS THE THIRTEEN INGREDIENTS WOULD BE. ADULTERATED UNDER THE LAW SO AGAIN IT PUTTING AN BILLION LINE WITH THE USE. OF PROHIBITS IT INGREDIENTS BUT WE USE. THE WORD ADULTERY BECAUSE THAT'S WAS ALREADY IN THE. DOES THAT MAKES. AND AGAIN- OUR COMMITMENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMETHING CAN BE SOLD IN THE TWENTY EIGHT UNFORTUNATELY SEEM TO BE TWENTY SEVEN E. U. COUNTRIES ARE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO FIGHT IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S THE COMMITMENT AND THE WE CERTAINLY HAVE SOME DETAILS TO WORK OUT. BUT I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE NOW TO SEND THE BILL OUT AND WORK OUT THOSE DETAILS WITH SOMETHING WHICH IS SOLID AS A BEEN IN MOTION FOR THE BILL THE NOT YET. I MAKE THE MOTION- I THINK THAT I HAVE A CONCERNS I'M MAKING THE MOTION BUT I AM IN THE SPREAD OF THE COLLABORATION THAT WE HAVE AND THEY AGREEMENT- MAKE THE MOTION. SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ON THE. ONLY ON. THE HARBOR AND LOOKING AT THE PIECE OF LEAD AND. ASBESTOS IN THAT I AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT LOOKS LIKE AN HOUR TRANSFER IT OUT BUT I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE COMMITMENTS WORKING ON- THE COMMITMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN THE PROCESS THAT CREATES THAT THERE IS A TIME LINE PUBLIC NOTICES HEARINGS AND SO FORTH- SO THEY'RE STILL PROCESS I MAKE A LITTLE FEAR- AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT LOOKS LIKE AT THE THEIR SPANISH OUT THERE BUT I KNOW THAT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT. MOVING FORWARD- AS WELL AND SO THOSE ARE THE PIECES- AND HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO ME SO I APPRECIATE THAT AND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TRYING TO MAKE THIS CONSISTENT WITH THE E.
