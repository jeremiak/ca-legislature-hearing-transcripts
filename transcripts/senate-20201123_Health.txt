OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS COME SO FAR HAS BEEN STRETCHED SO MUCH AND EVEN TODAY WE HAVE HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHICH HAVE ARE OVERFLOWING WITH PATIENTS. HOWEVER WITH RESOLVE WE CAN KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND CERTAINLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DONE BETTER THAN MOST BUT STILL WE ARE STILL NOW THE WOODS.

THERE HAVE BEEN MANY DIRECTIVES BULLETINS FAQS IFRSS EXECUTIVE ORDERS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS TO OUTLINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC IT'S NO WONDER THAT THERE IS CONFUSION AND SOMETIMES POSSIBLY CONTRADICTIONS BETWEEN THESE VARIOUS EFFORTS.

YES HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DAVID SHARP CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES ACTUALLY SPEAK UP A LITTLE BIT IS A WAY TO GET A VALUE A LITTLE HIGHER- SURE. THERE YOU GO SOUNDS GOOD. I IS THAT ANY BETTER YES. SO OKAY WE SHOULD GAIN WITH THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON- GOOD AFTERNOON TO ALL THE PANELISTS AND- THE DISTINGUISHED GAS- I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU- AND ON A STORY ABOUT AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED TO MY SON JEREMY- MY SON HAD A POTENTIAL OCTOBER. EXPOSURE ON- IN. ON SATURDAY- THE TWELFTH OF SEPTEMBER WE RESEARCHED LOCATIONS TO FIND- COULD BE TESTING. YOU KNOW LIKE THOSE DRIED UP- AND WE FOUND ONE AT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. SO MUCH AND MUCH OF THE PARKING LOT OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL LATE IN THE DAY WHERE TENTS WERE SET UP OUTSIDE THE SIGN ADVERTISING FOR. OCTOBER TESTING. IT HAS TO BE TESTED. POSITIVE YOU KNOW A POSSIBLE- AGREEMENT EXPOSURE. ONE IN ONE OF THE TENTS AND ASKED HIM TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY BECAUSE I GUESS IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY SO THEY- DIRECTED HIM TO COME BACK THE NEXT DAY. SO SUNDAY NINE THIRTEEN- HE ARRIVED AT THE SAME TENT AND I WAS TOLD THAT THE TESTING HAD BEEN MOVED INSIDE DUE TO SOME OPEN AIR QUALITY. THE SAME PERSON AND- DR MARK INTO WHAT WE SHOULD NOW EMERGENCY- WE KNOW THAT TIME BUT AND- AT THE COUNTER YOU KNOW THROUGH SECURITY. AND- THEY ASKED- IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM ASKED HIM WHY HE WAS THERE THE STATUS OF A TEST. THEY TOOK HIM BACK TO A- WAIT QUITE A LONG TIME- HE LEFT THE ROOM AND WAS- TO GO BACK AND WAIT IN THERE- SO HE HAS. A DISABILITY AS AB DE. SAC KINDA HARD FOR HIM TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHAT'S GOING ON. HE JUST WANTED ANSWERS TO WHY THIS DOES NOT SEEM LIKE A PROTEST THAT WAS ADVERTISED. SO YOU'RE MEETING SAID THAT THE DOCTOR DID SHOW UP IN THE ROOM. YOU CAN EVEN- WAS ASKED WHY HE WAS THERE. HE ANSWERED YOU GET A COLD ATTACHED. HE FINALLY DID GET SWAPPED- BUT HE TEXTED MOTHER MY WIFE WONDERING WHY THINGS WOULD TAKE THIS LONG MY WIFE CALLED AND NOW REALIZE HE WAS INSIDE THE EMERGENCY ROOM- HIS MOTHER CALLED THE HOSPITAL AND SPOKE TO SOMEONE IN THE- EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT- EXPLAINED. THAT THAT HE WAS ONLY THERE FOR A THAT COULD BE TESTING. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFORMED OUTSIDE AS ADVERTISED. THE PERSON INDICATED THAT IT WAS- THIS IS NOT FREE TESTING OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT NOT TO WORRY BECAUSE INSURANCE WOULD PAY FOR. MY WIFE ASKED WHY HE'D BEEN TAKEN INSIDE THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND IF WE WERE NOW GOING TO GET CHARGED FOR AN UNWANTED EMERGENCY. ROOM VISIT. THE PERSON TOLD HER YES. BUT- THEY HAD NOT YET SENT THE TEST STAND I GUESS THIS ONE TODAY TAKEN AND- IF WE DON'T WANT IT YOU CAN BE CANCELLED THE NOT SUBMIT IT SO SHE TOLD THE PERSON YEAH JUST. YOU KNOW CAN IT. AND- THE PERSON THAT WAS ATTENDING TO HIM TO GO AHEAD AND RELEASE THEM. BECAUSE HE WAS MISLED WHEN HE WAS TOLD TO GOING TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. BY THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE CRITICAL YES. SO JEREMY'S MOTHER EXPLAINED THE PERSON ATTENDING THAT HE COULD NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THE PAPERWORK AND EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS GETTING YOU KNOW ASKED TO SIGN BE DO IT DISABILITIES BUT HE WAS ONLY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS GOING FROM IT INTO A DIFFERENT PLACE TO GET THE PUBLIC AT. THE INDEPENDENCE. TWENTY LATIMER'S REMEDY LIGHT. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. MY SON JEREMY WAS REALLY JUST TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING HE WAS TRYING TO BE PROACTIVE IN PURSUING A CONTESTANT HE HAD A POTENTIAL EXPOSURE. HE SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED FOR AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT THAT HE DID NOT INTENTIONALLY MAKE AND NOT UNDERSTANDING THE RAMIFICATIONS OF BEING AN EMERGENCY ROOM. VISIT SHOULD NOT BE COUNTED AS EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND WE ARE ASKING THAT HE OUR CHARGES ALMOST NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO BE REVERSED. AND ONLY THE TESTING BE CHARGED. WELL TURNING A PROTOTYPE INTO A NUMBER ROOM VISIT WAS VERY MISLEADING AND WHAT RIGHT- AS OPPOSED- INCIDENTALLY I WENT BACK DOWN TO THE OUTDOOR TENTS AND TALK TO SOMEONE ABOUT THIS AFTER THE FACT AND SHE DID CONFIRM THAT YEP WE ARE GOING TO CHARGE YOU LESS AND HAD AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT. AND- THEY WERE RATHER AN APOLOGETIC ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION IT SHOWS THAT A LITTLE BIT UPSETTING TO ME BUT- WELL AS I WAS THERE THERE WAS STILL YOU KNOW PEOPLE ACTIVELY WORKING THE TAX. AND- STILL OPERATIONAL CARS DRIVING UP AND I DIDN'T SEE THEM DIRECTING ANYBODY INTO THE ER. I WAS A LITTLE BIT- ABOUT THAT WHOLE THING BUT- ANYWAY GOT THAT'S SORT OF MY STORY AND I'M- UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT. UNFORTUNATELY I'M I'M GONNA KILL IT BUT I GOT A FEELING THIS IS GOING TO COST QUITE A BIT OF MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE- I GUESS IF THERE'S A SUCH A THING AS A ROUTINE CO THE TASK BUT THAT WAS OUR INTENTION WAS REALLY TO JUST TRY TO. IDENTIFY IF MY SON HAD HAD IT SO WE CAN GO THROUGH THE NORMAL POLITICAL SPECTRUM. ANYWAY THANK YOU. WE NEVER GOT THE CHANCE. THAT'S HOW THE UP. THANK THANK YOU SHARP FOR SURE- YEARS AND THE STORY OF YOUR FAMILY- THE DICTIONARY- I KNOW THAT- SO WE'LL FIRST- TAKE UP GOT QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE- ORGANIZATION OF TODAY'S MEETING IT'S VERY TIMELY. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HEARING. REPORTS SEARCHES THAT SHARED BY MR SHARP IN MISTER SHARP IF YOU CAN HEAR ME. IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH YOU DID RECEIVE A BILL FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM DID THEY COMPLETE THE COVERT TEST THAT WAS THE SWAB THAT. WAS ADMINISTERED TO YOUR SON. NO THEY DID NOT SENATOR SO THEY DID NOT AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE OPTION THAT WAS GIVEN TO YOU. THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO PAY FOR EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. SO NO RESULT ON THE TEST AND YET AN EMERGENCY ROOM BILL. AND YOU SAID UBS YOU PLAN TO APPEAL IT. CAN DETECT YOUR FAMILY DID YOUR SON HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE. YEAH THAT'S THE REALLY THE REASON WHY I'M SPEAKING ON THE PRIMARY ON THE INSURANCE- AND- WE DO ROUTE- ANTHEM BLUE CROSS INSURANCE AND HAVE YET. STERN UHHUH. GO AHEAD EIGHT YES THEY DID NOT THEY DID- PICK UP ABOUT 40% OF THAT BILL- AND- INCIDENTALLY I LIKE TO ALSO COMMENT THAT THE BILL DATE CONTAINS A CHARGE FOR THE TEST. WHICH REALLY NEVER. GOT TOTALLY I GUESS BECAUSE THEY SAY THEY SWAP YOU MAYBE THAT'S THE FOR. NO RESULTS WERE EVER- ASCERTAINED- SESSION HAS STARTED WITH THIS BUT IF YOUR SON IS HE DOING OKAY DID HE CONTRACT CODE DO YOU KNOW. NO HE DID NOT THAN A LOT OF COMMENTS HE WAS EXTREMELY A SYMPTOMATIC RIGHT- BUT- WE DID SORT OF QUARANTINE I'M NEVER THE LAST- AND YOU KNOW. THAT THE PROTOCOLS WITH THAT'S WE COULD INSIDE OUR HOUSE AND WHATNOT BUT- BUT USUALLY RECEIVE NO RESULT OF A CO THE TEST AND YET YOU ARE CHARGED FOR IT. AND YOU SAY ANTHEM BLUE CROSS. HAS OFFER HER PAVE. PERCENT OF IT BUT THAT WOULD LEAVE YOU. WITH 60% OF A TEST. YOU DIDN'T ASK TO BE ASKED TO BE ADMINISTERED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SACRAMENTO. THAT'S CORRECT AND WHEN YOU SAY TASK THAT'S ONE PART OF THAT THE OTHER PART IN THE MOST- THE MAJORITY OF IT IS B. E. R. ITSELF WHICH I THINK WOULD BE EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SOMETHING DOLLARS RIGHT- MMHM SO THAT THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE PART. YES IN. WITH RESPECT TO ANTHEM BLUE CROSS BONTA PAYING 40% DID THEY PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY POLICY INTERPRETATION THAT SAID THEY WERE ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR. ADMISSION TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM YES. YES THERE WAS A BREAKDOWN I DID ASK FOR THAT I FORGET WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT DOCUMENT IS CALLED BUT I DIDN'T GET IT WITH THE BREAKDOWN OF THE- COSTS AND COVERAGES. I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME CENTER I'M SORRY- NO THAT'S OKAY YES I JUST HELP THEM. IT JUST RACES SEVERAL LAYERS OF. POOR COMMUNICATION IN APPARENTLY UNCLEAR POLICY THAT EIGHT YEARS SON WAS TAKEN INTO THE E. R. B. THEY DID A TEST SPIN NO RESULT EVER IN C. YEAR CHARGE FOR AN EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT OF QUICK RELATED TO A CODE REQUEST. BUT IF WHICH YOUR INSURANCE CARRIER IS ONLY OFFERING TO PAY 40% OF THAT SO.

BECAUSE OF THE FEAR OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR IT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CEREMONY JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION BEFORE MOVE ONTO OUR NEXT- CENTER IS GOING TO SPEAK WHICH IS GONNA BE CENTER RUBIO. FOR SURE READ. A SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEIR PLAN IS A STATE REGULATED PLAN OR FEDERAL REGULATED PLANNED- SO IF THEY COME TO TEAMMATES SEE AND SAID I HAVE A PROBLEM AND IT TURNS OUT TO FEDERAL PLAN- DO YOU HELP THEM WITH FILING WITH THE FEDERAL. FEDERAL AGENCY OR WHAT HAPPENS AND- YES THANK CHAIRMAN WE DO. HELP THEM ACTUALLY WITH FIRE. BUT WE CERTAINLY DO OFTEN THE WAR HAND TO THE APPROACH- THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY FOR THE RADIO PLAN- WE CAN ALSO THEM WE CAN BOB AND I PEOPLE COME TO US AND- THEY HAVE ACTUALLY. ADULT INSURED THAT IS IN THE- BY A AND- WHAT LOOKED LIKE IT. LICENSE HEALTH PLAN SO WILL AT THEM IN. FINDING ME UP.

THE RIGHT. OKAY THANK THANK YOU THE AWAYS VERY. CENTER RUBY. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL OF ALL IN TAKE FROM A TO STATE YOU TO. ALL OUR FIRST REACHED. AND RIGHT CHECK YOU KNOW NURSES AND DOCTORS WHO ARE. AND THE THREE OF DAY SPENT AND HELPING EVERY DAY DAY OUT HAVE A- THAT ALONG THE THAT MOM. I THINK SARAH GREEN YOUR BILL THE ONE DISCUSS THE LAYERS AND TRY OF THE PLAN WHEN THEY MUST PAY. AND BORN WHEN IF THEY IT'S A COST PLOUGH WHICH IS YOU KNOW I. THINK WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR TRUE THREE I'M A LITTLE. INSULET OVERWHELMED FOR THAT ARE OF IN THIS. BACK FOR THE ORDER. I YOU KNOW CITIZEN NOW THERE IN THIS NEED- IS THERE A DAY OR I IN FOR. WHERE YOU KNOW THAT PLANTS REQUIRED TO HOLD OR GIVE THE STATE'S. NOW WHETHER IT'S A- LOOK AT WEBSITES OR- WHERE WITH THE WHICH THE- WAY FOR THEM TO GO SEARCH IT THERE. WE ALWAYS SAY ONE OF THE BEST RESOURCES IS THE DAMAGE THESE. PUBLIC WEBSITE- WE HAVE- FAQ WE HAVE- LETTER TO PLAN WE HAVE. A CALL THE NIGHT AT DEDICATED AREA FOR COLBERT NINETEEN Q. NA SO THAT WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT PLACE FOR SOMEONE WHO NEED MORE INFORMATION TO GO TO THAT WEBSITE- BUT WE ALSO LOOK THROUGH OUR PLAN HEALTH PLAN PARTNERS TO ACCEPT IN SPREADING THAT. THAT MESSAGE OF HOW PEOPLE CAN GO ABOUT GETTING TESTED AND WHAT THE- WHAT THE COSTS ARE MAY BE OR OR NOT BE- AND THEN WE ARE TALKING- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE WERE TALKING WITH ON CONSUMER ADVOCACY GROUPS- WE'VE TALKED. WITH REPRESENT FROM. AND OR- JEWISH. TO THOSE. ARE WHAT ARE REGULATION. THE HEALTH PLAN YOU DO THEIR EMPLOYEES. CAN GO ABOUT GETTING GETTING TESTED WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR COST SHARING MAY. SO WE ARE REALLY TRYING TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT THERE BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ONE OF THE BEST RECORDS FOR. AND WILL LEAD IS THE DAMAGE THE PUBLIC WEBSITE. THE WELL HAD A WEALTH OF INFORMATION. THANK YOU I HAVE ONE MORE COMMON TO ADD TO THAT I THINK I HEARD ON TIER TWO ARE YOU CITY SYMPTOMATIC IT'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN YOU INCLUDED. TEACHERS AND AYE CATEGORY. I KNOW SEVERAL TEACHERS WHO WOULD NOT KNOW THIS INFORMATION LIKE- ONCE AGAIN I KNOW THAT THEY CAN GO TO THE WEBSITE BUT I THINK COLLABORATING WITH LIKE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO LET THEM KNOW WOULD BE IDEAL I KNOW. SEVERAL WHO DON'T TASK BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY OUT OF POCKET. SO IS THERE EFFORTS OR AGAIN I'M JUST TRYING TO- YOU KNOW- FIND OUT FOR PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW AND JUST TRYING TO SEE THERE IS A NEED THAT WE- NEED TO COLLABORATE CLOSER WITH WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ON THAT- I I'VE- I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT RECOMMENDATION I'LL TAKE THAT BACK. WE HAVE. A DEDICATED TEAM ON ON OUTREACH. I WILL TAKE THAT BACK TO THEM TO SEE IF THEY HAVE. GOING DOWN THAT PATH AND IF THEY HAVEN'T WILL CERTAINLY. ONLY TAKE TAKE THAT AND RUN WITH IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT'S ALL DR PAN THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR RUBIO- I DON'T SEE OTHER ANY OTHER HE ENDS UP AT THE MOMENT- SO. I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AS WELL- SO FIRST. LET'S START WITH SABRINA CORLETTE AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ABOUT THE WHAT'S GOING TO FEDERAL LEVEL- AND WE HEARD ABOUT MR SHARP'S- STORY- WHAT. WHAT SHOULD CALIFORNIA DO A WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA DO YOU KNOW WEDID HEAR FROM MY TEAMMATES ABOUT HOW THEY DO A WARM HAND OFF. DUE TO HELP PEOPLE IN A SHORT POSITION IF HE HAS IF YOU'RE A SELF REGULATED PLAN ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE. A SELF REGULATE PLAN SINCE WE DON'T HAVE THE STATE AUTHORITY OVER THOSE PLANS. FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- OUR STATE SHOULD CONSIDER DOING THAT REGARD. RIGHT IT'S CHALLENGING BECAUSE- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT IS PREEMPTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW FROM IMPOSING REQUIREMENTS ARE COVERAGE MANDATES ON SELF FUNDED PLANS- UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. ARISSA I DON'T KNOW WHAT TYPE OF COVERAGE- MISTER SHARPS HIS- AND IF IT IS A SELF FUNDED PLAN IT WOULD BE GOVERNED UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND NOT STATE LAW- IT. IRONICALLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAY HAVE. AFFECTED HIS BILL IS THE FACT THAT HE ASKED FOR THAT COULD BE TESTED BE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. I'M BECAUSE UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT ONLY KICKS IN IF THE TEST IS ORDERED OR ADMINISTERED DURING THE EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT. IF THERE'S NO COAL BUT NINETEEN TEST ON THE BILL THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY RECEIVES. THEN THE COVERAGE REQUIREMENT WOULD NOT. AGAIN- UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW. THANK YOU CELLS CELLS LIKE WE HAVE TO. ASK OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO HELP US OUT THERE HOPEFULLY THEY CAN KEEP THEIR REGULATIONS AS WE CAN'T DO THAT- THEN THIS IS NOW THIS QUESTION FOR BOTH- MISTER HìNH Z. AND NUMBER SIGN Z. AND SERRA REDEEM- THIS TRYING TO YOU TESTIFIED AND CERTAINLY- IT'S- REASONABLE SAY THAT OKAY WELL IF SOMEONE'S OUT OF NETWORK CARD IT SHOULD BE A REASONABLE COST WHICH IS NOT GO PAY WHATEVER- WHAT WHAT KIND OF GUY GUARDRAILS IS DEAL- I. HAS THE ARE PUT IN PLACE OR IS CONSIDERING PUTTING IN PLACE IN REGARDS TO THOSE PAYMENTS AND THEN ALSO I'M HOPING THAT- SERVING COULD ALSO PERHAPS COMMENT ON- WHAT OUR PLANS EXPECTED TO PAY IN TERMS OF TESTS. IF YOU GET A BILL THAT MIGHT THINK IS A BIT LARGE ARE ARE EXCESSES SO I NEED TO START WITH MR NINETY. THANK YOU SENATOR- RIGHT NOW THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CONTROLS THE LAW COMPENSATION FOR THE TESTING IS THAT PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL FAMILIES FIRST ACT INDICATORS ACTS AND THAT IS THAT THE PAYMENT IS EITHER THE NEGOTIATED RATE OF THE PROVIDER FOR THE TESTING- AND THE PROVISION OF THE TEST. FOR D. IF THERE'S NO NEGOTIATED RATE THE TEST THE EXCUSE ME THE PRICE THAT THE PROVIDER POSTS ON A PUBLIC WEBSITE. MMHM THAT'S THE STRUCTURE OF THAT NOW DEFINES WHAT. INSURERS NEED TO PAY ON THE ACCOUNT WHAT MATTERS CAN BILL FOR. LIKE ALL THE OTHER FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER THIS IS LIMITED TO THE DURATION. OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY SO HOW SHOULD WE LOOK FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN PERHAPS THE STATE MAY WISH TO HAVE A- LONGER EMERGENCY THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES HOME DISTRICT CENTURY MAY WISH TO CONSIDER LEGISLATION TO MOVE SUCH CONCEPTS OVER INTO OUR CODES THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU- SERINE GEN ONE COMMENT. YES I WOULD ECHO WHAT THE DURING THE BAD ON THE GLOBAL AND ADDS THAT OR- UNDER THE DAMAGE TO REGULATE WITH RESPECT TO. ENROLLEE WHO ARE A SYMPTOM OR WHO DO NOT HAVE A RECENT SUSPECTED OR KNOWN EXPOSURE TO COAL BUT NINETEEN. THE HEALTH PLAN WOULD HAVE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO PAY I'VE EVER BEEN ASSOCIATED RATE IF THEY PLAN ON THE PROVIDER HOW ONE. OR IF THEY DO NOT IF THEY AND MOULAY HAD GONE OUT OF NETWORK AND THEN PROVIDER WOULD BE COMPENSATED AT THE REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY RATE FOR KOBE NINETEEN TESTING AND THAT IT- KEEPING IN LINE WITH WHAT THE KNOCKED. KEEN ACT. BUT GENERALLY WITH. YOU OUT OF NETWORK- BUDGET. SERVICE AT. OKAY THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION ACTUALLY IT IS- FOR- DOCTOR JACOBSON AT THE CITY PH AND A I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE ON THE TESTING TASK FORCE AND- WELL I THINK CERTAINLY C. PH IS MORE FOCUSED ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH- RISKS AND- AND MANAGEMENT OF THIS PANDEMIC- AS THE- THE DEPARTMENT LOOKS AT. HIM BASICALLY- ESTABLISHING SURVEILLANCE OR OTHER TYPES OF TESTING IN WORKPLACES AND IN THE COMMUNITY- BUSINESS IS THERE ALSO ANY DISCUSSION AS TO WHO IS EXPECTED TO PAY FOR A SURVEILLANCE TESTING IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS INCLUDING WORKPLACE SETTINGS AND THIS THEIR SURVEILLANCE TESTING THE COMMUNITY- IT'S THAT THERE'S THERE BEEN DISCUSSION AT CDPH ABOUT WHICH ENTITY. SHOULD BE PAYING FOR IT IS THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS IT- WORK THE BUSINESS'S AT THE INSURER FOR THE EMPLOYEES THAT PERHAPS THE BUSINESS EVEN IF PAYING PARTLY FOR THE WORKERS COMPENSATION WHO WHO IS THE ENTITIES EBITDA BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES WOULD BE PAYING FOR EXAMPLE SURVEILLANCE TYPE TESTING THAT HAS. DEREK OUT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CDPH. SO THE FINE DETAILS OF THEM I MEAN- I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT ANSWER SERVICE I DON'T OKAY I DON'T WANT TO MISS SPEAK BUT I'M HAPPY TO TRY TO FIND THOSE ANSWERS I KNOW SOME OF THE GUIDANCE AS TO HOW PREFERENCES- TO- OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH- THAT. DOES HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON. SOME OF THE CADENCES BUT I'M HAPPY TO FIND OUT MORE DETAIL FOR YOU AND GET BACK TO YOU OKAY SO OKAY I JUST WANTED TO FIND OTHERS EVEN DISCUSSION OF THAT IN THE TASK FORCE OR NOT- AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. YOU KNOW THE FIRST ROLE CDPH IS TO ESTABLISH THE- STANDARD OF CARE IT'S BASICALLY STATUS TO STANDARDS WE SHOULD BE FOLLOWING BASED PRIMARILY ON PRIME PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES BUT- I KNOW OF THOSE PARTS QUESTION. YEAH OFTEN OFTEN PART OF THE DISCUSSION. OKAY ALL RIGHT. SO I GUESS SO THEN MOVE ON TO- THE SIMILAR QUESTION BUT FOR BETTER TEAR REMAND- BRUSTEIN Z- SO. IN TERMS OF PAYING FOR THESE THE- SURVEILLANCE WORKPLACE SAFETY- I GUESS ONE COULD DISTINGUISH% BETWEEN THOSE TESTS THAT WERE DONE BECAUSE THE WORKPLACE HEAD DECIDED THEY WANTED TO DO IS- VERSES THOSE THAT WERE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED PERHAPS EVEN THROUGH PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER BY. THE PARM PUBLIC HEALTH SO IN YOUR OPINION IS THAT SOMETHING THAT HEALTH INSURANCE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OR OTHER ENTITIES IF THERE IS TESTING WELL FIRST OF ALL THAT IS REQUIRED BY PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES THROUGH PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER. AND THEN- WHAT IF THERE IS- LET'S SAY A- A- AND- BOX AGREEMENT LET'S SAY BETWEEN THE WORKERS ARE UNION AND EMPLOYER FOR TESTING THAT MIGHT EXCEED THAT OF. PUBLIC THAT PUT OUT BY A TAPE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER- FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING WHO SHOULD BE PAYING FOR THAT TESTING- IS THAT SOMETHING INSURANCE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENSE ESPECIALLY PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER IS SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW. SO I NOTICED NAY BILL START WITH THAT CERA REAMS DID YOU HAVE ANY. THOUGHT ABOUT SO WHAT HEALTH PLAN SHOULD BE WITH TO DO IN THAT REGARD. SURE AND WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A FAIR NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH- REPRESENTATIVES FROM INDUSTRY- FOKKER BANNING- BUILDER CONVERTIBILITY THAN AND SIMILAR SORTS OF PLACES AND OUR ANSWER HAD BEEN UNDER A REGULATION WELL FIRST LET ME BACK UP UNDER THE CARE OF AN AFFECT THE R. THE FEDERAL ACCESS SOMEONE HAS- IT'S SYMPTOMATIC- HAD THE CLOSURE THEN THEY CAN'T BE TESTED. OUT OF NETWORK I WITHOUT A HOT WITHOUT QUESTION- IF WE HAVE THAT FOR EXAMPLE EXENCIAL WORKER- THAT NURSING. EMPLOYEE ARE NOT THEY'RE NOT ACT STRUCTURE AND OUR REGULAR. REALLY DO CONTEMPLATE THAT I ROWLEY WILL TO THEIR PLAN OR THEIR IN NETWORK PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN THAT HAS- THAT STRUCTURE AND DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE THAT THE EMPLOYER WOULD BE BRINGING IN- YOU KNOW A MOBILE TESTING UNIT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE TEST ALTHOUGH ALL THE EMPLOYEES- AT ONCE AND THAT HEALTH PLAN WOULD BE WOULD BE PAYING FOR THAT THAT'S SIMPLY NOT DOES NOT. REALLY SQUARELY FALL WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF THAT OF AN ACT CAN ACT BUT IT'S AN ESSENTIAL WORKER. I CHOSE TO BE TESTED MULTIPLE TIMES IN A WEEK- THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY THEY WOULD THE PLAN WOULD HAVE TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THAT CUTTING THE LONGER THAT WATER WENT THROUGH THE HEALTH PLAN OR THE IN NETWORK PROVIDER TO OBTAIN THAT TESTING. SO WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD PAY FOR IT- I CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION THAT UNDER THE KNOCKED KEEN. ACT THE HEALTH PLAN. HEY FOR AND FOR THE- WORKERS WHEN- NEED THE ESSENTIAL WORKER GOAL TO HELP PLAN FOLLOWS THE REQUIRE. OF THE OF THE REGULATE AND THE NOT AT. OKAY THANK YOU- PRECISELY FOR DEAL I. THE THANK YOU CENTER- AND I FOUR CREW GREG. RELEASED THE IRAQI. SAFETY AND HEALTH CARE FOR CAL. BASED ON. THERE'S THAT- FOR WORKPLACE EXPOSURES WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY DEFINED CONSISTENT WITH THAT- CDC GUIDANCE HELLO FIVE FIFTEEN- CUMULATIVE MINUTES A TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD OF EXPOSURE TO A- ON KNOWN OR SUSPECTED SOURCE OF CODE NINETEEN. THESE ARE- CAL OSHA- PROPOSALS WOULD REQUIRE. THE EMPLOYER TO PAY FOR TESTING. IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT EXPOSURE NOW THE CURRENT FEDERAL LAW THE FAMILIES FIRST AND CHARISMATIC REQUIRE COVERAGE BY INSURERS IF A- TREATING PROVIDER TENDING PROVIDER WHO NEED NOT BE DIRECTLY PROVIDING CARE BUT HAS. REVIEWED EIGHT PATIENTS ON A STEP UP SITUATION DETERMINES OF THAT TESTING IS MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE GENDER PROTECTIONS OF THE FEDERAL LAW REGARDING OUR COVERAGE WITHOUT- COST SHARING- CAMPBELL LIKE APPLY. AND SO WE GET TO THE QUESTION- REGARDING OF THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY SYMPTOMATIC SPREAD THAT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT IN RECENT MONTHS THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE A SITUATION WHERE- THE PROPER FILTER IS WAITING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE SYMPTOMS BECAUSE. WE WANT TO CATCH THE SYMPTOMATIC- FEDERAL WE MEDICALLY OF. BASED A- REVIEWING PROVIDERS ASSESSMENT. OPENS THE DOOR TO POSSIBILITIES FOR ON THE- APPROPRIATE TESTING OF PERSONS WHO ARE NOT DEMONSTRATING SYMPTOMS FROM WHO DO NOT HAVE OCCUPATIONALLY DEFINED EXPOSURE BY ARM IF THAT PROVIDER THINKS THAT THE TEST IS MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE THEN IT GETS COVERED WITH THE PROTECTIONS OF THE ACT THAT'S- OUR CURRENT SITUATION OUR CURRENT PATH. AGAIN THE STATE MAY WISH TO ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES THAT-LEVEL ON THE HOME. COVERAGE WHERE INSURERS WILL BE PAYING FOR SEX- TESTING- SEPARATE AND APART FROM THE CURRENT SOMEWHAT TEMPORARY OF FEDERAL LAW THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND THEN FINALLY WHEN- A QUESTION ABOUT- WELL- SO PLAN RIGHT THEY GET THEY THEY GET THE- REQUEST REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE PROVIDER OR TO FIGHT OR SEEN THE PATIENT- HOW ARE THE PROVIDERS INSURANCE COMPANIES SUPPOSED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE TALK ABOUT THIS TEARS- S. B. ESSENTIAL WORKERS FROM THE- OTHERS. SO MANY OF DIRECT THAT TO- SERRA REAMS- SO WE HAVE THE DIFFERENT TIERS YOU TALKED ABOUT BUT- HOW TO SORT OUT WHO'S IN WHICH HERE- AT LEAST IN THE PLAN I GUESS I GUESS A PROVIDERS OR SEEN THE PATIENTS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM ALTHOUGH AGAIN WE COULD BE REMOTELY OR SOMETHING. HOW DO YOU DISTINGUISH BETWEEN PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT TIERS AND THE PLAN GETS THE REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST SO HOW DO THEY TELL. YEAH ADMITTEDLY I BUT I COULD SEE THAT IN AND PRACTICES YOU KNOW I OTHER COULD BE SOME DIFFICULTY THERE. HOWEVER WE HAVE PUT IN THE REGULATION AND FURTHER GUIDANCE- AFTER THE REGULATION. THAT THE HEALTH PLAN CAN'T FIND OUT. THE PROVIDER BOB. WHAT THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND IF THE PROVIDER BECAUSE YEAH. YOU KNOW I THE PERSON WONDER BELIEVE AYE THEY WEREN'T A WORKER I'M BAD AT ALL THE EVIDENCE THAT THE HEALTH PLAN CAN ASK. FOR PUTTING THAT PERSON IN THAT HERE. A HEALTH PLAN WE WANTED TO SURE THAT. PLANT IN THE PROVIDER NOT GET A BACK AND FORTH. WITH THE HEALTH PLAN OKAY ELECT SHOW WITH THE PROOF SHOWING WHERE THE FOR WORKS WHAT THEY- ALL THE AND BELIEVE ME NEED DO WITH YES I AT THE I'M A SOCIAL. AND THEY INTO THAT BUCKET. WE WANTED TO MAKE IT AS AS- AND EASY AS POSSIBLE THE OFFENSE WORKERS TO. A TESTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT OKAY. NOT SEEING ANY HANDS UP- I TO THANK EACH OF YOU YOUR- AT- AND A- NOW. TO ON TO- SERVER RESPONDED SO HAVE TO ACTUALLY SEE. WITNESSES FOR. THE FROM MANY TO. PERSPECTIVES ON THIS VERY ISSUE OF- PAYMENT FOR TESTING. ENSURING PEOPLE ACCESS TO TESTING. TERMS OF- SO.

I'M SO SORRY THERE'S SOMEONE GOING THERE. IS DISTRACTING. JUST GOING- HOW THE CONSUMER ALLIANCE PROVIDES LEGAL SERVICES TO ALL HELP CONSUMERS IN EVERY COUNTY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AREA LEGAL AID SERVES SEVEN COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA WITH FREE LEGAL SERVICES IN REGARDS TO HEALTH INSURANCE RELATED LEGAL ISSUES. AND I HAD TO CLIENTS STORIES TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY BOTH CLIENTS SOUGHT MEDICAL SERVICES FOR KOBE TESTING AND BOTH HAVE PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST CLIENT IS A FAMILY WITH A ONE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IN LATE MARCH OF THIS YEAR THEIR DAUGHTER HAD CODE NINETEEN SYMPTOMS INCLUDING A FEVER. WORRIED ABOUT COVERT NINETEEN THE PARENTS TOOK THEIR DAUGHTER TO THE ER TO BE TESTED FOR CODE NINETEEN. AT THAT TIME IN LATE MARCH THIS HOSPITAL DID NOT HAVE ANY COLOR NINETEEN TESTS THAT THEY COULD ADMINISTER ON THE CHILD TO THE HOSPITAL DECIDED THEY WOULD GIVE HER A TEST FOR THE FLU. WHICH IF SHE TESTED POSITIVE FOR FLU IT WOULD BE LESS LIKELY BUT SHE WAS POSITIVE FOR COCAINE. THE CHILD ENDED UP TESTING POSITIVE FOR FLU AND ARE SENT HOME A FEW MONTHS LATER THIS FAMILY RECEIVED A BILL FOR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE ER VISIT. THIS FAMILY CALLED US BECAUSE THEY WERE CONFUSED AND FRUSTRATED FOR RECEIVING THIS BILL. THE HEADLINES ABOUT LAW CHANGES BUT THIS FAMILY TO BELIEVE. THAT THE SERVICE WOULD BE FULLY COVERED. THE SECOND CLASS HAD CONCERNS ABOUT TWO SEPARATE COBRA TOPS. THE FIRST TASK THE CONSUMER WAS HAVING SYMPTOMS AND WANT TO GET A TOP FROM A NEARBY HOSPITAL THE CONSUMER LATER RECEIVED A BILL FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS THE CONSUMER CHALLENGES BILL WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THE HOSPITAL HAS START BILLING HIM FOR THIS BUT IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BILL FOR THIS TEST. THIS CLAN ALSO HAD AN ISSUE ABOUT ANOTHER CO PROTEST HIS THROAT SPECIALIST DOCTOR ORDERED HIM TO TAKE COVER TEST BEFORE HIS THROAT EXAMINATION. THE CLIENT RECEIVED THIS COVER TEST AT A FACILITY WHERE THEY'RE THROUGH DOCTOR REFERRED HIM TO. MONTHS LATER THIS CLIENT RECEIVED AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS FROM HIS INSURANCE BUT STATED THAT THE PATIENT PORTION FOR THIS COVER TEST WAS FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE CONSUMER HAS NOT YET RECEIVED A BILL FOR THIS AMOUNT BUT THERE IS CONCERN THAT THIS PROVIDER WILL BUILD THIS KIND OF ACTUALLY FOR THE SERVICE BASED ON THIS EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS. THAT YOU TO WRAP UP SORRY. ANY CALIFORNIANS WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO THEIR HEALTH PLAN REGULATOR IS OR WHO HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR BILL CAN CALL THE HELP CONSUMER ALLIANCE FOR FREE CONVERSATION WITH A HEALTH CARE IT'S ATTORNEY. WE CAN BE REACHED AT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT ZERO FOUR. THREE FIVE THREE SIX OR BY VISITING HEALTH CONSUMER DOT ORG. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO- WILLIAM EISENBERG- CHIEF QUALITY SAFETY OFFICERS UNDER HEALTH- PROVIDING A PROVIDER PERSPECTIVES. THIS PROJECT WELCOME YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY ABOUT THE EXPERIENCES THAT PHYSICIANS INCLUDING MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION HAVE WITH THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN TESTING REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDELINES WELL APPRECIATE THE GOOD INTENTIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE IN DEVELOPING THESE GUIDELINES ITS EMERGENCY REGULATIONS HAVE CREATED CONFUSION AMONG HEALTH PLANS PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS AND IT HITS THE STATE'S PUBLIC HEALTH OBJECTIVES AS DEVELOPED BY HHS AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AGAINST THE NHC'S CURRENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS INSTEAD OF MAKING DIAGNOSTIC TESTING MORE ACCESSIBLE TO PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IS REGULATIONS ACTUALLY CREATE BARRIERS BY PROVIDING GUIDANCE ON HOW HEALTH PLANS MAY IMPOSE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT RESTRICTIONS AND COST SHARING OBLIGATIONS ONTO THEIR ENROLLEES. WHO ARE SEEKING TESTING. YEAH SHE'S EMERGENCY REGULATE PLACE THE BURDEN ON HIS. TO TRY WHO SENT AND NONESSENTIAL WORKERS AND THEREFORE FOR WHO UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES CARSHARING OTHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD APPLY. AND IN SUCH NON VALUE ADDED MINISTRY OF TASKS ON TO PHYSICIANS CONSUMES PRECIOUS DIRECT HEALTHCARE TIME FOR US DOCTORS. HERE BY. ALTERNATELY DECREASING ACCESS FOR OTHER PATIENTS ARLENE ACTUALLY MAKES ANY SENSE. ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC- THE EMERGENCY RADIO HOW. THE HEALTH QUITE WOULD BE NAY MISTER. IS OPERATION IMPRACTICAL GIVEN THE YOU'RE ROLLING SELDOM IF EVER CONTACT THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT WITH THEIR POSITION. IMPOSING THIS UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER OKAY NINETEEN TEST IS MEDICALLY NECESSARY FOR ENROLLEES. OFTEN CAN DELAY THEIR ABILITY TO DECODE THE NINETEEN TESTING BY FOUR DAYS AND ULTIMATELY RECEIVE NECESSARY CARE IF POSITIVE I IN. THE SIX STATES. BECAUSE SHARING IS CARING TAX CODE NINETEEN PARTICULAR FOR MEN IN. COMMUNITY AND WE KNOW THAT THEY'VE BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY BY THIS VIRUS. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WHO HAVE CHRONIC CONDITIONS THAT OFTEN FOR TELEWORK PROGNOSIS AND COPING ARE THE PEOPLE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. TO ACHIEVE HEALTH EQUITY BARRIERS LIKE THIS MUST BE REMOVED SO THAT EVERYONE IS AVAILABLE HE COULD BE TESTING AND TREATMENT OPTIONS. GIVEN THERE'S I NEED ACCESS TO CODE NINETEEN DIAGNOSTIC TESTING IN FACT THEY WERE TESTING DESERVES PARTICULARLY IN RURAL AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. INDIVIDUAL SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THEIR TESTS WHERE THEY CAN READ THEIR GEOGRAPHICALLY LOCATED. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S AN IN NETWORK OR OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER AND ASK YOU TO WRAP UP PLEASE THANK YOU. I SHALL- AS YOU MENTIONED DR HAND IN YOUR INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS FOR THIS SESSION THIS PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC REQUIRES EXTENSIVE TESTING EXPANSIVE TRACING AND TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS DIAGNOSTIC TESTING PER CODE NINETEEN SHOULD BE MEDICALLY NECESSARY BASIC HEALTHCARE SERVICE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND THE DECISION TO TEST SUFFICIENT PROGRESS EXCLUSIVELY BETWEEN PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT. WITHOUT THE INTERPOSITION OF THE HEALTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M HAPPY ARTICLE THANK YOU WE WILL BE TAKING QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE PANEL- NEXT WE HAVE DEIDRE DD KENNEDY PRESIDENT OF DENNIS'S HEALTH INSURANCE SERVICES AND CHAIROF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE OF LOS ANGELES SO SEASON HEALTH WRITERS. WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIRMAN DAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR. INCLUDING US. MONEY TO CANDIDATES PRESENT BENEFITS HEALTH INSURANCE SERVICES AND WE REPRESENT OVER FORTY FIVE LARGE AND SMALL EMPLOYERS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA ROUGHLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. IN A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES- I AM SERVING CURRENTLY AS THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE L. A. IS THERE'S THE ISSUE OF HEALTH UNDERWRITERS AND HAVE. GONE TO SACRAMENTO THE LAST TWENTY THREE YEARS TO. OUR DAY AT THE CAPITOL AND GREATLY APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE IS FOCUSED ON BALANCE BILLING. SPECIFICALLY CODED BALANCE BILLING- INTERESTINGLY. AND IRONICALLY. CLOSE TO HOME WITH MYSELF AND MY FAMILY MY SON WAS EXHIBITING. SYMPTOMS WE CALL OUR FAMILY DOCTOR WE WERE REFERRED TO THE LOCAL HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL DID. THE TEST. AND IT CAME BACK NEGATIVE AND WE FOUND. A BILL THAT DID COME TO US A BALANCE BILL FOR A HUNDRED DOLLARS IT WAS FOR A- SPECIMEN HANDLING FEE. I CALLED THE HOSPITAL'S BILLING OFFICE AND- WAS PLACED ON HOLD THE CHARGE WAS DROPPED FROM OUR ACCOUNT. AND WHEN I CAN QUESTIONS YOU KNOW WHY I WAS RECEIVING ON A BILL ON SOMETHING THAT WAS TO BE COVERED AT A 100% BECAUSE SYMPTOMS WERE PRESENT. THE BILLING CLERK COULD NOT GET OFF THE PHONE FAST ENOUGH WHICH REALLY. YEAH THE WAY THE CALL WAS HANDLED. REALLY SHOWED ME THAT THERE WAS- AWARENESS THAT THIS WAS AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BILL THAT WAS SENT OUT. WE HAVE- CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION AND THE L. A. S. WE POP TO A LOT OF OUR- TO SEE THE PRO. OF BALLOT BILLING AND WE'RE THAT IT'S NOT AS PRO. AS IT MIGHT BE I THINK I MAY BE ONE OF THE ONLY INCIDENTS THAT. HAS COME UP. IN MY ROLE AS A HEALTH INSURANCE BROKER REPRESENTING EMPLOYERS. IT'S OUR JOB TO GATHER KNOWLEDGE AND TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO EMPLOYERS AND REALLY DO A GREAT DEAL OF THE MEETING- FIVE OUTREACH. AND BRIAN LAND ON THE CURES ACT WAS PASSED AS WELL AS OTHER ACTS AND OTHER. FEATURES OF THE PANDEMIC ROLLED OUT WE REALLY TOOK A- STRONG ROLE WITH EMPLOYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THEIR BENEFITS- OF. COVERED AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE IN TERMS OF COVERING FOLKS THAT HAVE EXPOSURE OR SOMETIMES. TO WRAP UP. WE DEVELOPED A SERIES OF- IN FACING. CAMINO WE A GREAT DEAL OF OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT EMPLOYEES AND WE ALWAYS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WHEN THEY HAVE A ISSUE WITH THE BALANCE BILL THAT THERE TO TURN TO US AND I WOULD REALLY KIND OF EXTEND THIS TO MR SHARK- I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TURN TO YOUR AGENT AND ASK THEM TO ASSIST WITH- CLARIFYING WHY THAT'S GOING ON AS WELL AS TO ADVOCATE ON YOUR BEHALF. AND WITH THAT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE AND THANKS AGAIN THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU- IT WAS RUNNING OVER A LITTLE OVER THERE TWO MINUTES HERE BUT- FOR IMPORT INFORMATION- TRAINING GONZALEZ VICE PRESIDENT POLICY AT CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WELCOME. TO GET OUT OF HAND AGAIN MY NAME'S TRAINING IS ALSO THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THE HEARING TODAY AND OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE SOME PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ON THE FRONT LINES I LIKE TO QUICKLY START TAKING US BACK TO MARCH AND THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC AT THE TIME. AS A STATE WE HAD LIMITED CAPACITY TO DO BECAUSE THE NINETEEN CASTING AND NOW WE HAVE SOME BETTER CAPACITY TO DO MORE TESTING AND MUCH OF THIS HAS COME DIRECTLY FROM THE INVESTMENTS MADE BOTH BY THE STATE AND BY HOSPITALS- SINCE THE START OF A PANDEMIC BUT EVEN WITH THESE COLLECTIVE EFFORTS UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SIMPLY INADEQUATE AT THIS TIME. BECAUSE GIVEN THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DO MORE TESTING CONFLICTING REQUIREMENTS AND GUIDANCE FROM STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT'S CREATED CONFUSION AMONG PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS AND GIVEN THE CURRENT SURGE AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN DEMAND. FOR TESTING CLARITY IS NEEDED. SPECIFICALLY PRIORITIES FOR THE UTILITY OF. TESTINGS OF. SHOULD BE PROVIDE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH LOW. THIS CAN BE DONE BY AN PROVIDING YOU. PROTOCOLS AND PRIORITY. SUCH AS WHETHER BOTH SYMPTOMATIC AND ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS SHOULD BE TESTED. WE WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS. TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM FOR STATE WIDE PRIVATIZATION BUT MAKES CLEAR IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THESE RESOURCES SHOULD BE EXPANDED. AND ONCE THESE PRIORITIES ARE ESTABLISHED PAYMENT POLITICIAN SHOULD BE ALIGNED TO SUPPORT THEM AND HELP ENSURE ADHERENCE. LASTLY AND MOST CALIFORNIANS ARE PROTECTED FROM BALANCE BILLS IN THE CURRENT STATE LAWS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN PROTECTING PATIENTS FROM UNEXPECTED BILLS. HOWEVER HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED GAPS STILL EXIST FOR PEOPLE COVERED BY FEDERALLY REGULATED SELF INSURED PLANS PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS AND UNION TRUST FUNDS AND CERTAIN PPL PLANS. BOTTOM LINE PATIENTS SHOULD BE SHIELDED FROM THESE AND EXPECTED BILLS. HAS COVERED NINETEEN CONTINUES ITS RELENTLESS SPREAD IN OUR STATE AND THE NATION. EVERY CALIFORNIA AND OTHER RECOVERY CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL IN HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED. ON THE OTHER THEIR BEHALF WE EMPLOYEE TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH OF. THOSE NEXT UP WE HAVE- BILL BARCELONA EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR AMERICA'S PHYSICIANS GROUPS WELCOME. THANK YOU DR PAN. WELCOME OF THE COMMITTEE- BILL BARCELONA A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY CALIFORNIA MEMBERS OF AMERICA'S PHYSICIAN GROUPS WERE PROFESSIONAL SOCIAIS HAITIAN OF. PHYSICIAN ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE NATION TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COSTS AND PATIENT OUTCOMES. IN CALIFORNIA REMEMBER SERVE EIGHTEEN MILLION PATIENTS. CAPITATED MEDICAL GROUPS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FREE CODE TESTING WITHOUT CO PAY. FOR THEIR PATIENCE. MANY OF SET UP SPECIAL TESTING CENTERS AFTER THE PANDEMIC ROSE- IN ADDITION TO THEIR USUAL. FALL CAMPAIGN TO SUPPLY ANNUAL FLU SHOTS TO THEIR PATIENT POPULATIONS. REMEMBER POSITION ORGANIZATIONS ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY FOR THIRD PARTY TESTING COSTS REGARDLESS OF PRICE THAT MAY BE SUBMITTED. BY THEIR PATIENTS DURING THE EMERGENCY. MEDICAL GROUPS HAD EXISTING CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR TESTING LABS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND WHEN THE TESTING KIDS FIRST BECAME AVAILABLE LEISURE CHEATED THEIR EXISTING CONTRACTUAL RATES AND SAID NO CHARGES FOR ALL CODE RELATED TASKS THIS IS WHY DO A MATTER AND NUMBER OF DISPUTES THAT REMAIN UNRESOLVED AT THIS TIME REGARDLESS OUR MEDICAL GROUPS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO PAY THOSE CHARGES AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF TESTING IS THE AVAILABILITY OF TEST RESULTS TO THE PATIENT'S REGULAR TREATING POSITION. COORDINATION OF TESTING RESULT AVAILABILITY HAS BEEN DIFFICULT SO FAR DURING THE PANDEMIC- THERE'S BEEN A LACK OF DATA ACCESS- THAT CAN DELAY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN CASES WHERE THE TESTS ARE REPORTED TO BE POSITIVE. KURT COBAIN COSTS RUNNING APPROXIMATELY TWO TO THREE DOLLARS PER MEMBER PER MONTH. ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN A CAPITATED GROUPS. THERE WAITING ANXIOUSLY TO SEE WHAT THE EVENTUAL ADDITIONAL PRICING OF THE CODE BAXEEN. WILL ADD TO THAT PER MEMBER PER MONTH COST BURDEN. SOME ORGANIZATIONS ARE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN TESTING CAPABILITIES HOWEVER- SUCH AS THE UC MEDICAL GROUPS AND SOME OF OUR- NUMBER F. Q. AC SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. AND THIS PROVIDES MORE AFFORDABLE AND IN SOME CASES EVEN MORE RAPID TEST RESULTS. MESQUITE- UP UP. ABG HAS BEEN IN. REGULAR COMMUNICATION WITH DAMAGE SEAT- WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE- HEALTH PLAN LAWSUIT AGAINST THE EMERGENCY REGULATION. THERE'S BEEN A HUGE AMOUNT OF RESTRICTING ON THE MEDICAL GROUPS THIS TIME BUT THEY REMAIN- COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ACCESS TO PATIENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO CRISTINA KRISTI FORTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TO CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS CHRISTY FOR NON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA CLINICAL LABORATORY ASSOCIATION. HE STILL IS PROUD TO HAVE AS MEMBERS SEVERAL LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORIES SUCH AS QUESTION LAB CORE HOSPITAL LABORATORY SUCH AS CEDAR SINAI ACADEMIC LABORATORIES SUCH AS UC DAVIS AND OTHER INDEPENDENT LABS. IN THE LABORATORY STATE CLERICAL ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CARBON NINETEEN WE APPRECIATE THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ISSUED OVER THE SUMMER BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. AT INTENDED TO ALLOW FOR MORE TESTING FOR CALIFORNIANS HOWEVER WE HAVE A FEW CONCERNS OUTLINED BELOW. FIRST WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S POSITION STATED IN THE GUIDELINES TO HEALTH PLANS BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO COVER SEROLOGICAL TESTING FOR KOBE NINETEEN ANTIBODIES. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT BEEN ATTENDING PROVIDER HAS DETERMINED THE ANTIBODY TESTING TO BE MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PATIENT. HE'S REALLY RESPECTFULLY DISAGREES WITH THIS CONCLUSION THAT ANTIBODY TESTING IS NOT DIAGNOSTIC IN PART BECAUSE THE FDA AND CDC DOES NOT PUBLICLY STATE ANYWHERE THAT THERE IS NO DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR ANTIBODY TESTING. RATHER FDA AND CDC BOTH CURRENTLY STRESSED ANTIBODY TESTING PLAYS AN IMPORTANT DIAGNOSTIC ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CARBON NINETEEN IN CERTAIN MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE. SITUATIONS SECOND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TREATMENT OF BILLION FOR TESTING OF A SYMPTOMATIC THE CENTRAL WORKERS WITH NO KNOWN SUSPECT SUSPECTED EXPOSURE TO CODE NINETEEN. SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE ESSENTIAL WORKER DETERMINATION AND THE CAUTIONARY. IT IS CRITICAL THAT IT BE MADE CLEAR THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE ESSENTIAL WORKER STATUS AND NOT THE LADS SINCE CLINICAL LABS DO NOT DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH PATIENTS AND THEREFORE CANNOT GATHER THE INFORMATION. TO THAT ED HEALTH PLAN SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO DENY OR DELAY PAYMENT OR TO SEEK RECRUITMENT OR OR REQUEST DOCUMENTATION OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS FROM THE PROVIDERS. LIKEWISE HEALTH PLAN SHOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO IMPOSE COST SHARING FOR A SYSTEMATIC ESSENTIAL WORKERS FOR COVERT TESTING AGAIN CLINICAL ABSENT INTERACT WITH THE PATIENTS BUT ARE FORCED TO TAKE ON SOME OF THE BILLING COLLECTIONS RESPONSIBILITY IN ADDITION THIS COST SHARING MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETERRENT. TO TESTING FOR THESE A SYMPTOMATIC. ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THE REGULATION INDICATING CASES OF DELEGATION THE RESPONSIBLE REMAINS A HEALTH PLAN UNLESS THE HEALTH CLINICS PHYSICALLY DELEGATED THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TESTING. EASILY IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT THIS PRESENTS AS CLINICAL LABORATORIES WILL NOT KNOW WHETHER A PARTICULAR PLAN HAS DELEGATED THAT FINANCIAL RISK FOR CO TESTING. TO PROTECT LEARN INDEPENDENT PRACTICE ASSOCIATION. FINALLY I PA'S SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO RESPOND TO THE CLAIMS FOR THE CODE TESTING INDICATING THAT THE FINAL FINANCIAL RISK HAS BEEN DELEGATED OR NOT. IN TO PROVIDE COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INSURANCE CLAIMS INFORMATION TO ALLOW THE BILLING RESPONSIBLE PLAN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU. FINALLY WILL HAVE A NUCLEUS OF ICE PRESENT LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER- IN MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES IS HERE WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS THANKS FOR INVITING US TO THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. ON CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS TAKE SERIOUSLY THEIR ROLE IN HELPING CALIFORNIANS THROUGH THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC. AND HEALTH PLANS ARE COVERING TESTING FOR KOBE- PATIENTS WITH ZERO COPAY. FOR OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OR TO THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED- ACCORDING TO STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS. THOSE STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS- ARE CERTAINLY WELL INTENTIONED IN THE PLANS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO MAKE THEM OPERATIONAL. ON HOWEVER I MEMBERS ARE WITNESSING SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES- THE GMAC TESTING REGULATIONS INTENDED TO REDUCE BARRIERS FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS- OUR PLANS HAVE INDICATED TO CAP- THROUGH A SURVEY- THAT ABOUT 50% OF THEIR ENROLLEES IN GROUP PLANS ARE IN INDUSTRIES THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. THIS IS AT LEAST TWELVE TO THIRTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT'S THE UNIVERSE OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE DMZ REGULATIONS ON HIS MASSIVE. TRYING TO MAKE A COMPLEX REGULATION OPERATIONAL FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ON THIS CHALLENGING FOR ALL PARTIES- PROVIDERS AND HEALTH PLANS- IN CAP MEMBERS HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO SIGNIFICANT AREAS OF CONCERN. ONE A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF OUT OF NETWORK CLAIMS FOR TESTING AND SHE WAS SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN TESTING COST BETWEEN IN NETWORKING OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS AND LABS- THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY THIS PROBLEM COULD BE OCCURRING- INCLUDING- AND UNINTENTIONAL MISCONCEPTION ON THE PART OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC EMPLOYERS. ACCORDING TO A NATIONAL SURVEY OF HEALTH PLANS NEARLY A QUARTER OF CODE NINETEEN TESTS ARE NOW ADMINISTERED OUT OF NETWORK. FEES OUT OF NETWORK COSTS FAR EXCEED IN NETWORK COSTS. MEDICAID PAYMENT RATES FOR A TEST IS ABOUT A HUNDRED DOLLARS V. AVERAGE COMMERCIAL RATE IS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS. CAD MEMBERS ARE RECEIVED CLAIMS FOR NOT FROM NON CONTRACTED PROVIDERS SOME LABS THAT ARE MORE THAN THREE TIMES A MEDICARE PAYMENT RATE. I'M IN SOME- EVEN MORE EXCESSIVE- OUR PLANS ARE SEEN MAXIMUM CHARGES HIGH IS FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THIS IS- CERTAINLY AN ANOMALY HOWEVER MANY PLANS OF REPORTED MAXIMUM BILL CHARGES OF AROUND SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND ACCURATE. SURE AT NEVER CROSSES PROBLEM THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT HIS ACTIVITY IN COST PRESSURE COULD OUT AS YOU MATTER PREMIUMS BEING COLLECTED BY THE PLANTS- LOOK FORTY EXPLORING WAYS OF THE DEPARTMENTS- AND STATE ARE NOT RESOLVING THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE ALL THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WE ARE OVER HERE TODAY I KNOWTHAT SO. EACH PERSON HAD A FAIRLY BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME. NOW LIKE TO OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS FOR. OUR REACTOR PANEL. RIGHT I DON'T SEE ANY CANS UP THE MOMENTS- OKAY. ALL RIGHT WELL ACTUALLY THEN I WILL ASK A FEW QUESTIONS HERE AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO WHO PRESENTED- SO I AIN'T I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE YOU KNOW SEVERAL OF YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF- I WAS TRYING TO DETERMINE HIS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER OR NOT- WELL MAYBE I'LL START OFF MAYBE WITH THAT MR LEE IT WITH NICK PLEASE US AT THE- TELFORD SAYS HE HEALTH PLANS SO YOU HEARD. PROBABLY FROM SOME OF THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS SIR CHALLENGING YOUR LAB YOU'RE NOT INTERFACING WITH THE PERSON AND EVEN MEDICAL GROUP AT CETERA- WHAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE OF FIRST OF ALL THE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH PLANS ON- THE DVT GAINS WITH THESE TEARS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU DETERMINE WHO. SUCH A WORKER NINE HOW DO WE PREVENT PEOPLE WHO MAYBE ESSENTIAL WORK HOW DOES THE PLAN SORTED OUT. YEAH SO IT'S SO THAT WE DON'T END UP HAVING PEOPLE GETTING NOTICES ALL THE TIME HAVING. TO JUSTIFY WHETHER DURING SUCH A WORKER NOT. YEAH YOU KNOW I. WISH IMAGINED SOLUTION TO THAT. QUESTION MISTER CHAIR- I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO THIS ISSUE- BE. A SYMPTOMATIC SYMPTOMATIC DISTINCTION DOES PROVE TO BE A PRACTICAL AND OPERATIONAL PROBLEMS FOR THE PROVIDERS. I'M IN FOR THE PLANS. FOR PURPOSES OF COMPLYING WITH THE REGULATIONS- YOU KNOW. YEAH WE HAVE TALKED OUR MEMBERS ABOUT THIS- WE DO KNOW THAT- MANY OF THE PLANS ARE PROVIDING A NON MANDATORY GUIDANCE TO THEIR PROVIDERS- ON THEIR PREFERRED CODING- IN THE SITUATION SO THAT THINGS CAN BE PROCESS MORE. ARE CORRECTLYAND EFFICIENTLY- HOWEVER THE CODING IN AN OF ITSELF TO DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE IS IT IS AN ESSENTIAL WORKER- IS VERY UNCLEAR- AT THIS MOMENT AND YOU KNOW I. PERSONALLY AM NOT. OF THE NUTS AND BOLTS PERSON THAT TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHERE WHERE WHERE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEM- EXISTS. BUT I'M NOT NOT ALL LABORATORIES ARE USING THE SAME PRACTICES ARE CODES- WITH RESPECT TO ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ON IT CAN BE HARD FOR BOTH- WILL BE HARD FOR THE HEALTH PLANS. TO IT TO MAKE THAT. DETERMINATION- SO WE ARE SO. TO IT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH OUR PROVIDERS- IN IN PROVIDING AS MUCH GUIDANCE AS WE CAN ON THE ISSUE BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE IT AS A PROBLEM. OKAY AND THEN- ACTUALLY- FOR KELSEY WALDRON- OVER AT BAY AREA LEGAL AID- YOU DITCH YOUR ABLE TO SHARE SOME STORIES ABOUT PEOPLE WHO GUIDE- DOES COST SHARE TO BALANCE BILLED FOR THEIR TESTS- IN IN YOUR WORK- WHAT SEEMS TO BE. THE MAIN I GUESS TRIGGER FOR THIS TO HAPPEN SO WE'VE HEARD A PRESENTATION ABOUT THE FEDERAL RULES ARE WE HAVE OUR STATE RULES. WHERE WHERE DO PEOPLE TEND TO GET TRIPPED UP- AND DAY TO DAY YOU MADE SOME MENTION THAT. PERHAPS SOMEONE ACTUALLY KNEW THAT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT CAN YOU PERHAPS ELABORATE A BIT THANK YOU TO YOU GIVE US TWO STORIES I KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY BROADER DATA- FROM- YOU. FROM EITHER YOUR ORGANIZATION OR OTHER. LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS IN TERMS OF WHERE. THE AND WE DID YOU% MISTER SHARP STORIES WELLS WHERE WHERE WHERE DOES IT SEEM LIKE THE CALL GETS DROPPED OR- IS THIS- WHERE'S THE GAP. THERE IN TERMS OF PEOPLE GETTING BILLS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTIONS. I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST GAPS IS THAT CONSUMERS FEEL VERY CONFUSED RIGHT NOW- BECAUSE THEY SEE HEADLINES THAT SAY. COME BEEN TESTING SHOULD BE COVERED IT WILL ALWAYS BE COVERED AND- THERE'S JUST A GENERAL. FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY BACK COVER TESTING WILL BE COVERED- AND CONSUMERS JUST DON'T HAVE THE MORE NUANCED DETAILS LIKE WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY LIKE. IF YOU'RE AN ESSENTIAL WORKER WILL BE COVERED OR IF YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS IT WILL BE COVERED AND SO- AND A LOT OF CONSUMERS DON'T WHEN THEY CALL. MOST CONSUMERS WHO COSTS DON'T KNOW WHO THEIR HEALTH PLAN REGULATORS DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE A FEDERAL REGULATOR PLAN OR CALIFORNIA REGULATED PLAN AND SO CONSUMERS REALLY ARE IN THE DARK HERE. ABOUT WHAT IS COVERED AND WHAT IS NOT AND- I THINK THERE IS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION. IT COULD BE FIXED BY THE PLANS COMMUNICATING MORE CLEARLY WITH THEIR INSURED ABOUT WHAT IS COVERED- OR- I'M I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE- PEOPLE JUST ARE UNCLEAR WHAT IT WILL BE COVERED AND ONE IT WON'T BE ON PEOPLE ARE FRANKLY SCARED WHEN THEY HARD CODED SYMPTOMS AND THEY WANT TO GET IT PASSED- AND SO. THEY'RE NOT EXACTLY THINKING ABOUT WILL MY INSURANCE COVER THIS RATE THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND THEY'RE AFRAID- AND UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE ANY BROADER DATA ABOUT- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MY ORGANIZATION SERVES. SEVEN COUNTIES THROUGHOUT- THE BAY AREA AND- I'VE SHARED WITH YOU ALL THE THREE CLIENTS STORIES THAT MY OFFICE- HAS HAD INCLUDING MISTER SHARP. ALAMEDA COUNTY- AND SO. THAT'S REALLY ALL THE DATA THAT WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY SHARE. THANK YOU ACTUALLY I DON'T KNOW IF DOCTOR JACOBSON STILL ON FROM CDPH CHANNELS ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL ARE YOU STILL ON OR NOT. I AM STILL ON BOTH EXCELLENT THANK YOU SO I DID WANT TO ASK YOU IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL- WE HEARD THAT YOU KNOW THAT- SOME OF THIS IS CONFUSING BUT- BUT AT THE SAME TIME. SHOULD THE MESSAGE BE OUT TO THE PUBLIC IF YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT YOU SHOULD GO AHEAD AND GET A TEST DO WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT MESSAGE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT I KNOW WE'RE CARE DELVING INTO THE INS AND OUTS OF THE REGULATIONS. IN TERMS BUT- WHEN YOU GET A MESSAGE OUT TO THE PUBLIC IN ORDER FOR THE TO GET A BUS PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE. WHAT KIND OF YOU KNOW DO WE WANT TO GO AND SAID WELL ACTUALLY SHOULD GO AND CHECK TO SEE IF IT'S COVERED BY INSURANCE ONLINE AND OF COURSE A LOT OF PEOPLE DROPPED OUT BECAUSE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT IT ISN'T BUT PERHAPS JUST BECAUSE THEY WILL GO THROUGH THE BOTHER OF THAT OR DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT NOT BE COVERED. SO FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT YOU NEED TO SPEAK TO WHAT SHOULD BE THE PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGE. OUT THERE ABOUT TESTING. AND AND THEN OF COURSE- EXPECTATIONS IN TERMS OF- IMAGE. SHOULD BE TRYING TO COVER EVERYBODY SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE PULLING THEMSELVES BACK FROM. TESTING SO. ADDICTED BECAUSE THAT'S OUR CAME OUT OF THE- THE COMMENTS FROM THE LEGAL AID COMMUNITY. SO SENATE HEARING POLICY OWNERS. YEAH I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION SHOULD WE BE ENCOURAGING FOLKS TO GET TESTED- IS THAT BAY YES GOOD QUESTION THE CRUX OF THE QUESTION IS THAT SHOULD WE TELL IT SHOULD BE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT SURE WE TELL PEOPLE YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE CONCERNED GET TESTED RIGHT IF YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE EXPOSED YOU HAVE SYMPTOMS OR EVEN IF YOU'RE A SYMPTOMATIC BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED YOU'RE WORRIED YOU GO AHEAD TESTING OR SHOULD WE TELL PEOPLE WELL ACTUALLY. IF YOU'RE WORRIED. ALL YOUR HEALTH PLAN FIRST. BEFORE YOU GET TESTED GREAT BECAUSE THAT BECOMES A BARRIER TO PEOPLE GETTING TESTED AND YOU MAY HAVE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY SHOULD BE TESTED WHO ARE. NOW ITSELF. I AM I I'M JUST INTERESTED FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT SO OBVIOUSLY ALL THIS OTHER STUFF HAPPENS THE BACKGROUND WE WANT PEOPLE TO GET SURPRISE BILLS OR- GET CAUGHT WITH BILLS. BUT FROM A STRICTLY PUBLIC HEALTH STANDPOINT WHAT SHOULD BE THE MESSAGE VIA. TO THE PUBLIC IN TERMS OF TESTING. YEAH SO STRICTLY PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT SHOULD BE TO GO GET TESTED IF YOU HAVE CONCERNS THAT YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED IF YOUR SYMPTOMS THAT YOU. THINK MIGHT BE COVERED SYMPTOMS. WE DEFINITELY WANT YOU TO GET TESTED. OKAY SO- ALL RIGHT NORTH I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I THINK SOME OF THAT AND I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY IT GETS COMPLICATED AND THIS INVOLVES MONEY AND- I DO HEAR FROM. FROM MANY PEOPLE ABOUT. NOW HE'S SUPPOSED TO PAY FOR IT NOW GETS BOUNCED BETWEEN THIS ORGANIZATION THAT ORGANIZATION BUT- ALSO BUT I THINK ULTIMATELY WE WANT TO TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT THEM TO DO. RIGHT AND I THINK I CERTAINLY WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK THAT- THE- OUR REGULATORY AGENCIES ARE. HAVE BEEN. TO LEANING THAT DIRECTION IN GENERAL BUT- BUT LET ME GO AHEAD JUST A FOLLOW UP QUESTION PERHAPS WITH THAT DR EISENBERG- SO. ON THE FRONT LINES FOR- PHYSICIANS ARE DEREK SINCE WITH WITH SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT COMES UP ABOUT COVERAGE- WHAT SHOULD PHYSICIANS BE TELLING THEIR PATIENTS WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING TESTED SO THEY CALL THEIR DOCTOR ARE TO SAID DOC WHAT SHOULD I DO- WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE SHOULD. DOCTORS BE SENDING TELLING PATIENTS IN TERMS OF GETTING TESTED CHECK YOUR HEALTH PLAN FIRST BE SURE COVERAGE OR- WELL YOU KNOW NOT DEPEND I THINK YOU'VE POINTED TO THE CONUNDRUM THAT I TRIED TO- EXPLAIN THEIR WHICH IS. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO OUR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION YOU POSED TO- DOCTOR JACOBSON IS YES GET TESTED IF YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED IF YOU THINK THAT THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT YOU COULD BE CARRYING THIS VIRUS. YOU SHOULD BE TESTED. AND YOU KNOW IT'S- LIKE ANYTHING ELSE IN MEDICINE. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO. INTERPOSE SOMEBODY OUTSIDE OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS AN ELIGIBLE PATIENT IT IS SOMEBODY THAT SHOULD GO THROUGH THIS ROUTE SHOULD GO THROUGH A DIFFERENT ROUTE SHOULD CHECK WITH THEIR HEALTH PLAN FIRST AND FIND OUT IF THEY SHOULD WAIT TWO DAYS FOR A CALL BACK FOR FOUR DAYS FOR A CALL BACK. IF WE DETERMINED AS THEIR POSITION THEY NEED TO TEST IT SHOULD YEAH THE PASSENGER EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN EIGHT BEGIN THE PROCESS OF TREATMENT AND BEATING IN THE PROCESS OF CONTRACTORS SO LET ME JUST QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT NOW- I THINK QUITE HEARD EARLIER WAS THAT IF THE DOCTOR SAYS YOU GET TESTS FOR MOST. PART IT TENDS TO GET COVERED. BUT WHAT ABOUT. PEOPLE WHO DON'T. BOTHER GOING TO THE DOCTOR AND SAID JAHNS WORRIED AND YEAH WE HAVE TESTING CENTERS SO FORTH AND I'M JUST GOING TO GO GET THE TEST AND THEY SAY HERE WORDS INSURANCE INFORMATION AND THEY GET A BILL. ON THE BILL GET SENT OFF TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY- SO DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A- THOUGHT ABOUT THAT. ASPECT OF THINGS SHOULD PEOPLE BE GOING TO THE DOCTOR FIRST. WELL I GUESS I ALWAYS. IF ANY PATIENT ANY PERSON CALIFORNIA HAS A HEALTH CONCERN. THEIR FIRST CALL IS LIKELY TO BE ADDED TO THEIR POSITION WE DON'T WE DON'T CURRENTLY EXPECT. IF PEOPLE WILL CALL THEIR HEALTH PLAN FIRST HE FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY SHOULD CONTACT YOUR DOCTOR- IT'S- SORT OF FOR A IT'S NOT LIKE I'M- CONTEMPLATING HAVING. COSMETIC SURGERY DONE AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT- SOME OF THEIR ALL OF THEIR PORTION AND IT MIGHT BE PAID FOR BY MY PLAN FIRST. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE THAT HAS RESULTED IN A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC. THEREFORE IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE DIRECT FIRST CONTACT SHOULD BE WITH THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. IN OKAY THANK YOU. AND THEN- THE GONZALEZ IN WE HEARD STORY OF MR. SOME OF THAT WILL. PLAN BUT THEY GOT A BILL FROM THE HOSPITAL AND IF YOU WERE ON FOR THAT STORY- WHAT GUIDANCE IS THE HOSPITALIZATION GIVING ITS MEMBERS REGARDING PEOPLE WHO ARE SHOWING UP- PERHAPS JUST TO GET A TEST AND- GETS REDIRECTED OR- IN TERMS OF- IN. TERMS OF BILLING FOR OTHER SERVICES ASSOCIATED. THANK YOU SO MUCH- YES SO THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION'S BEEN IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH OUR MEMBERS REGARDING THE EVER CHANGING- LAWS AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL AS A RESPONSE THIS PANDEMIC AND SO- THERE ARE WE HAVE A WEBPAGE DEDICATED TO GRANT THE CORONA VIRUSES SPECIFICALLY FOR OUR MEMBERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE VARIOUS GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS IS FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS FOR THOSE COMING FROM CD PH OR- THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES- WHETHER THAT'S ISSUES COMING FROM THE DMH C. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. REGARDING A PAYMENT AND I'M SORRY THE RAIN COVERAGE EXCUSE ME RELATED TO THAT- AND OUT LIKE A LAMB AS WELL AS WANTING TO ENSURE THAT CLAIMS ARE PAID PROPERLY MISTAKES DO HAPPEN- AND IF WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT THAT KNOW ABOUT THAT. AND THAT COMES WITH THE COMPLEXITY UNFORTUNATELY AS GLASS AND THE SKILLS ASK KELSEY AS WE GET NOTED THE COMPLEXITY AND DEALING WITH EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS- AND RESTORING WHEN THINGS GO WRONG- BUT AS I THINK TESTIFIED ALREADY PREVIOUSLY BY A AB THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND YOU SEE WE HAVE BEEN SEEING ANY WIDESPREAD ISSUES- BUT CONTINUE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR MEMBERS AND- AND PATIENTS AS THEY A. B. C. ARE POTENTIALLY RECEIVE THESE KINDS OF BILLS. OKAY THANK YOU AND FINALLY- JUST ONE LAST QUESTION NICK LOUISA'S- YOU DID MENTION THAT YOU'RE HAVING A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF OUT OF NETWORK- BILLS FOR TESTING- CAN YOU PERHAPS TOUCH I MEAN SO WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO TO- YOU KNOW PLACES LIKE VERILY OR- OTHER TYPES OF PLACES TO GET TESTING TESTING IS NOT ALWAYS WIDE DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE IN THE STATE TESTING COULD BE MORE OR LESS WIDELY AVAILABLE SO- SO CAN YOU MAYBE TOUCH ON- WHERE. DOES TESTS I MEAN THEIR ACT ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO TEST UNNECESSARILY. OR IS IT JUST THAT PEOPLE I EARNED IT. I MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO OF THAT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF TESTING IS WITH THAT. HAVE A START TO AS WELL BUT- AND ANSWER HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT- ISSUES ABOUT TO TAKE PROVIDER. CHARGING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY PARTICULAR TASKS AND I THINK A- BUT CAN YOU JUST PERHAPS SPEAK TO. ME TO ME MAY NOT BE NECESSARY UNEXPECTED AND SPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC THAT YOU'D HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL QUOTE UNQUOTE OUT OF NETWORK TESTS BECAUSE- PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY JUST. TRYING TO FIND A- THE TESTING. CENTER THAT'S CONVENIENT TO THEM THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE. HAD A CONTRACTOR DEMANDED SET UP RECENTLY SO I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF IT IS. LIKE THESE COMMUNITY TESTING SITES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT YOU FIND YOURSELF. THAT YOUR MEMBERS FIND YOURSELF PAYING FOR. PIANO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- YOU KNOW THE BEST NUMBER I HAVE IS- SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM OUR PARTNER TREAT A HEN. VIA NATIONAL TRADE FOR THE HEALTH PLANS- YOU'D DID A SURVEY NATIONALLY AND- THEY INDICATED THAT. AMID THE MAJORITY ABOUT 58% OF OUT OF NETWORK TESTS. WITH PRICES THAT EXCEED AVERAGE COST. BOND WORRIED MINISTERED. IN STANDALONE LABORATORIES- SO THAT'S ONE YOU KNOW DEFINITIVE NUMBER- THAT THAT I HAVE SEEN- I THINK FOR A LOT OF THIS. OUT OF NETWORK ACTIVITY- IS COMING FROM IS- YOU KNOW IN TALKING TO OUR MEMBERS AND ACCORDING TO THEM IT APPEARS THAT MANY EMPLOYERS WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE- HAVE EITHER TAKEN TO GMAC IS REGULATIONS OR OTHERWISE TO MEAN THAT. THEY COULD CONTRACT WITH THEIR OWN TESTING VENDORS- AND ENROLLEES COULD GO TO ANY OUT OF NETWORK TESTING VENDOR- IN. IS A MISINTERPRETATION- OF WHAT IS INTENDED BY THE DEMAND SEE REGULATIONS ON AND IS LEADING TO A HIGH NUMBER OF OUT OF NETWORK- BILLS BEING FORWARDED TO THE PLANS. NOW YOU KNOW THE PLANS ARE GENERALLY PAYING THESE CLAIMS BUT- YOU KNOW AS NOTED IN PREVIOUS TESTIMONY- YOU KNOW BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS YOU KNOW DO LIMIT THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES- THAT THE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO RECEIVE- FROM THE PLANTS WHICH EITHER- YOU KNOW NEGOTIATED RATE A CASH PRICE- THAT MUST BE LISTED ON THE TESTING VENDORS WEBSITE. AND YOU KNOW OUR PLANS DO SAY THAT SOME OF THESE- TESTING FACILITIES ARE NOT ACTUALLY LISTING- THAT CASH PRICE ON THEIR WEBSITE- WHICH YOU KNOW TO MY KNOWLEDGE DOES NOT HAVE YOU KNOW ANY PARAMETERS ASSOCIATED WITH IT- AT LEAST THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- YOU KNOW OR- YOU KNOW THE PLAINTIFF USUAL AND CUSTOMARY. CUSTOMARY SO- SO THAT IS KIND WHAT WE'RE WE'RE SO WHAT WE SUSPECT IS LEADING A LOT OF THE OF NOW- ACTIVE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THANK ALL THE OF THIS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR ANSWERING- THE QUESTIONS- PROPOSED I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS UP FROM OTHER MEMBERS OKAY- AND- AGAIN I THINK THIS CAN BE VERY HELPFUL AS WE- MOVE FORWARD- PARTICULARLY- WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE NEED TO DO- THOSE- COVERED CONTINUES UNFORTUNATELY- WE'RE GONNA MOVE NOW ON TO THE- NEXT SECTION OF OUR A HEARING WHICH- WAS- ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY GOING TO FOCUS MAINLY ON PAYMENT FOR TREATMENT- BUT- WITH. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF- AT LEAST TWO I GUESS NOW THREE POTENTIAL UNKNOWNS BEEN APPROVED YET- VACCINES- THAT HAVE SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS- WE ALSO WANT TO CUT. TOUCH ON- COVERAGE FOR- KODJAK SCENES ONCE- WE HAVE APPROVAL AND THEN WAITS FOR DISTRIBUTION AND THEN OF COURSE ALSO WITH TREATMENT OF- COVE IT AS WELL- IT OF WHAT ARE THE- FEDERAL AND- REGULATIONS- RECOGNIZING THE CODE IS A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE- SO WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TESTING BUT- WHEN PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO GET. THEIR ORDER NOT ABLE TO GET THAT PREVENTION LIKE A VACCINE- THEY CONTINUE TO BE A RISK TO THE GENERAL POPULATION IN TERMS OF BE ABLE TO PASS ON. THIS A VERY SERIOUS VIRUS SO WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN THIS DISCUSSION AGAIN- ONE OF WELCOME BACK SABRINA- CORE COLLETTE HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT- WHAT IS THE CURRENT FEDERAL. GUIDANCE REGULATIONS ON COVERAGE NOW OF- TREATMENT AND FLEET THAT ACT- COVER NINETEEN VACCINES AS WELL THANK YOU. WELCOME WELCOME BACK- GOOD TO MEET- OKAY SO MISTER MY SCREEN AGAIN- HOPEFULLY YOU ALL CAN SEE THAT- SO. ON TO VACCINE I SO WHAT HOPEFULLY GOOD NEWS AND SORT OF INCOME AS COVERAGE FOR TEST IS- THANKS AT LEAST IN LARGE PART TO THE AFFORDABLE ACT LET'S HOPE THAT COVERAGE FOR VACCINES IS A LITTLE SIMPLER- SO UNDER THE ACA INSURERS MUST COVER AND WE'VE COST SHARING OR VACCINES THAT ARE RECOMMENDED BY TE CDC'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES FOR ROUTINE USE. UNDER THE ACA PLANS AND INSURERS WERE GIVEN UP TO TWO YEARS YOU IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION INTO THEIR BENEFIT. WITH THE CARRIERS ARE IN. OF THIS YEAR WHY- SO THAT TIME FROM YEARS TO FIFTEEN GATE. THE ONCE IT'S SET ISSUES IT'S WRECKED. PLAN NOW HAVE DAYS. TO IMPLEMENT THE COVER MANDATE- WE ALSO SOME WILL THEY CAN JUST LAST MONTH- THEY CLARIFY. THAT NEEDS AN ANSWER HAVE TO. NOT ON A MINUTE. OF THE- I'M THAT THOSE OUT OF NOT FOR HAVE TO RISK A- PAYMENTS IT DOESN'T OF REASONABLE IT SAYS THAT ON. RATE WE BE REASON ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND PROVIDE IN THE BACKS PROGRAM WHO FROM BALLOT BILLING OUT. EASTON'S MAXINE'S. I'M RULES ALL SAY THAT ACT DOES OF THE BACK IS ROOMS YOU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED IS OKAY. I'M. RECOMMENDATION THERE'S NO TIME LIMIT ON HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE A STEP THE ISSUE THE RECOMMENDATION AFTER. GOOGLE THE- I SUSPECT WILL BE UNDER PRESSURE TO A QUICK RECOMMEND BY THERE'S NO. THE OTHER ISSUE OF COURSE IS NOT AC COMPLIANT PLANS ARE EXACT SO HEALTH CARE SHARING MINISTRIES. GRANDFATHER SIXTEEN DOWN PRODUCTS FOR TERM ARE ALL EXEMPT FROM THIS REQUIREMENT. THIRD I'M PLANS ARE STILL ALLOW TO ARMS EXERCISE REASONABLE MAN. WE NOW OF UP TO THREE MANY. WITHOUT THERE'S NO REQUIRE IN FEDERAL LAW FOR PLANS TO COME ALL THREE BACK BY ALL FREE AND- SO IT'S HARD THAT THEY MAY JUST TO COME ONE NOT ENOUGH. ALSO THAT I OF NETWORK PROTECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. WHICH IS STATED THIS CURRENTLY SUPPOSED AND I'M. TWENTY YOU THAT ALL OF THE IS BOY. IF THE AFFORDABLE CARE IS OVERTURNED IN CALIFORNIA TEXAS WHICH IS. BEFORE SUPREME. I'M WE SEEM LIMIT STATE. ON THAT COVER TO OUR EARLIER THIS AND FOR- COVERAGE SINCE WITH THE LAW WHICH IS- WAIVER OF. FOR A FUTURE. I WOULD I LOOK FORWARD TO QUESTION. REGARDING CORPORATE NINETEEN VACCINATIONS ON JUST THE ACCU ECHO WHAT PROFESSOR CORLETTE SAID. UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW HEALTH PLANS MUST COVER. WITHOUT COST SHARING ALL PREVENTIVE SERVICES WITHIN A OR B. RATING FROM THE UNITED STATES PREVENTIVE BIRTH THE PASSPORT. AND IMMUNIZATIONS RECOMMENDED BY THE PDP EITHER% BINARY COMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATION PRACTICES. WE THEREFORE DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN VACCINE WILL MEET THE STANDARD IN WHICH CASE THE PLAN WILL HAVE TO COVER KOBE NINETEEN VACCINATIONS WITHOUT COST SHARING. ADDITIONALLY UNDER CURRENT LAW HEALTH PLANS MUST ASSUME THE FINANCIAL RISK FOR ADULT AND CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION. OF THE PLAN WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PASS THESE COSTS ON TO THE PROVIDER. UNLIKE THE PROVIDER IN THE PLAN HAVE THE TYPICALLY AGREED OTHERWISE. AND THEN FINALLY REGARDING HOBART NINETEEN TREATMENT- PLAN WILL COVER ALL MEDICALY NECESSARY SERVICES AND TREATMENT. I CURRENT LAW ALLOWS PLANS TO CHARGE COST SHARING AS ALLOWED BY THE LOWLY IN THE CONTRACT WITH THE PLAN AND THE FULL TO TRUE FOR KOBE NINETEEN TREATMENT AND SERVICES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO BRUCE- HìNH SEE WITH- DEPARTMENT INSURANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR INNOCENT RIGHT HAND HOME SABRINA ALREADY TOLD YOU THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE REGARDING- COLONEL VIRUS VACCINATION ONLY APPLY TO. NON GRANDFATHERED ACA COMPLIANT COVERAGE NOW THE INSURANCE CODE PREVENTIVE CARE STATUTES. WHICH IS A SEXUAL ONE A ONE ONE TWO POINT TWO OF THE INSURANCE CODE SIMILARLY ONLY APPLIES TO NON GROUND FROM THE COVERAGE. OF INSURERS ARE REQUIRED TO COVER PREVENTIVE CARE WITHOUT PATIENT COST SHARING OF. ACQUIRED IN NETWORK. THAT WOULD INCLUDE THE VACCINATIONS- HOWEVER THE TIMELINE CURRENTLY BAKED IN LAW STATUE. AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW TO IS THE- OBLIGATE TO PROVIDE THIS PREVENTATIVE CARE ONLY COMES INTO EFFECT ONE YEAR AFTER THE FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES WHICH MET THIS MORNING- MAKES ITS RECOMMENDATION SO THE STATE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER REQUIRING THAT GRANDFATHER COVERAGE ALSO EXPLICITLY COVERED THE KOBE BAXEEN WITHOUT COST SHARING. AND REQUIRED INSURERS COVER THE BAXEEN FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PREVENTIVE SERVICE NOW WITH REGARD TO TREATMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BELIEVES THAT ALL INSURERS TO COVER COVERT NINETEEN TREATMENT. HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH TREATMENT MAY NOT BE COVERED WOULD BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE INSURANCE CODE DOES NOT REQUIRE THE INSURANCE COVER BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES OUT FAR OUTSIDE OF THE NORM GRANDFATHERED. INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP. SO DOES APPLY TO FATHERED. DOESN'T APPLY A LARGE GROUP AGAIN THE STATE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO ADOPT REQUIRING A LAW REQUIRING ALL HEALTH INSURERS TO COVER BASIC HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS INDIVIDUAL SMALL AND LARGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE NEXT WE HAVE TRICIA- BLUE BLUE BLUE CHURCH I HAVE A MISPRONOUNCE YOUR NAME- FROM THE DIPPY DIRECTOR FROM DIVERSITY PARAMUS OFFICE OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH THE- WELCOME. THANK YOU YES GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR NUMBERS I'M TRICIA BLOCKER BLOCKERS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THE STATE'S WORK IN PREPARING FOR A CARBON TAX SEEN I'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLANNING LIKE THE STATE'S OVERALL RESPONSE TO CURB IT NINETEEN WERE USING DATA AND SCIENCE TO GUIDE OUR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE VACCINE PROGRAM. AS THERE'S NO IT A VACCINE YET CALIFORNIA'S PLANNING PROCESS INCLUDES INSURING THE CURVE IN NINETEEN VACCINE MIXTAPE THE REQUIREMENTS. ENSURING THE VACCINE IS DISTRIBUTED AND MINISTRY EQUITABLY AND ENSURING TRANSPARENCY FREE BRINGING COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE OUTSET. GOVERNOR NYESOM RECENTLY NAMED A SCIENTIFIC SAFETY REVIEW WORKGROUP COMPRISED OF PHYSICIANS SCIENTISTS WITH EXPERTISE IN IMMUNIZATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH. SHORTLY FOLLOWING THE ANNOUNCEMENT WASHINGTON OREGON AND NEVADA JOINED OUR EFFORT. THIS GROUP IS CURRENTLY STAYING ABREAST OF THE VACCINE TRIALS REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY AND PROVIDING RECOMMENDATIONS. GOVERNOR SOME ALSO ANNOUNCED THE DRAFTING GUIDELINES WORK GROUP THIS GROUP IS CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THE ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK FOR WHEN VACCINES ARE IN LIMITED SUPPLY. AND SOON IN UPCOMING ANNOUNCEMENTOF THE COMMUNITY VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH WILL PROVIDE INPUT AND FEEDBACK FOR ONGOING PLANNING EFFORTS TO ENSURE EQUITABLE VACCINE ALLOCATION DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATION. READ TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO PREPARE FOR THE EVENTUAL DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES IN CALIFORNIA. THIS INVOLVES PLANNING WITH CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. WE'RE LEVERAGING CALIFORNIA'S WELL ESTABLISHED EXISTING IMMUNIZATION FRAMEWORK AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE INFRASTRUCTURE TO COORDINATE OUR EFFORTS BETWEEN STATE LOCAL AND TRIBAL AUTHORITIES. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL BOTH ADMINISTER VACCINES AS WELL AS ALLOCATE TO ASSIST IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS. TO PROVIDERS. THE ROLE OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS SUCH AS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS HEALTH CLINICS PHARMACIES AND OTHERS IN THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION WILL DEPEND ON THE VACCINE SUPPLY AND THE STAGE OF THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN. THEY'LL BE SEVERAL PHASES OF THIS PLAN. FIRST IS THE PRE BAXEEN WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE PLANNING PHASE- AND THEN THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LIMITED DOSES THAT ARE WILL BE AVAILABLE AND WHEN THE ALLOCATION FRAMEWORK WILL BE UTILIZED. AND THEN FINALLY SUFFICIENT WIDESPREAD SUPPLY INDUCES FOR THE ENTIRE POPULATION. THE VACCINATION COMMUNICATION PLAN IS FOCUSED ON ENSURING EVERYONE LIVING IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVED TIMELY ACCURATE AND ACTIONABLE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE CARBON NINETEEN VACCINATION PROGRAMS AT EACH STAGE OF IMPLEMENTATION. IN ADDITION THE CDPH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH FEDERAL AND LOCAL PARTNERS TO CREATE THE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE NEEDED AND WILL DISSEMINATE IT THROUGH ALL COMMUNICATION CHANNELS FOR PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC ALIKE. RIGHT NOW CITY PH IS IN THE EARLY PROCESS USE OF RECRUITING AND ENROLLING COBIT NINETEEN VACCINE PROVIDERS INCLUDES COLLABORATION WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S IMMUNIZATION COALITIONS AND STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSOCIATIONS. WORK IS UNDER WAY TO ENSURE THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE IS ROBUST AND WILL MEET THE EXTENSIVE IN THE REGION. IRONS FROM CDC SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE PROVIDERS NEEDING TO REPORT ADMINISTERED DOSES WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS INTO THOSE DATA SYSTEMS. OUR DEVELOPING STATE RIGHT BACK UP PLANS FOR ULTRA LOW COLD STORAGE AND DRY ICE TO SUPPORT THE STORAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE LEADING VACCINES. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST IN THE WORK TO DATE ON THE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN. WE STILL HAVE A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT TIMING QUANTITY AND EFFICACY OF THE EVENTUAL BAXEEN AND THERE'S SEVERAL VACCINES AT VARIOUS STAGES IN DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK DILIGENTLY TO PREPARE AND BE READY TO DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE AS SOON AS IT'S AVAILABLE THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD O YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- TRICIA BLOCKER- LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. K. I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP AT THE MOMENT. RIGHT SO I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- ACTUALLY FACT MY FIRST QUESTION- PREPS FOR. SABRINA CORLETTE- SO IT'S BEEN SUGGESTED FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE GRANDFATHER PLANS WE HAVE SOME OTHER TYPES OF PLANTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW SOME OF THE ACA REQUIREMENTS IF THE STATE IMPLEMENTED OUR OWN LAWS. THROUGH FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS- DESSERTS SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL STATE COSTS BECAUSE THAT FALLS AFOUL OF ESSENTIAL BENEFITS SIR. DO OF YOU HAD ANY COMMENT- THOUGHTS ABOUT IT'S THE STATE TRIED TO MOVE ON ITS OWN TO TRY TO PULL SOME OF THESE PLANS IN. INTO A AT AND FUTURE LEGISLATION. THE REQUIRED COVERAGE. NO NO I'M NO IF THE STATE WERE TO MANDATE THAT FOR EXAMPLE- GRANDFATHER PLANS OR- AFTER SHARING MINISTRIES ARE OTHER PLANTS THAT ARE DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE ACA. ARE TO COVER THE VACCINE THERE'S NO- THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE STATE TO DEFRAY ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR HELLO- AND THEN AS- FOR- I GUESS CENTER REEM AND- BRUCE HINES THE- IN TERMS OF- BUT- WHAT ARE WHAT ARE YOUR RESPECTIVE- AGENCIES PLANS FOR ISSUING GUIDANCE. TO THE TO THE HEALTH PLANS YOU REGULATE- SO FOR EXAMPLE SAID. WE DON'T KNOW WE COULD END UP HAVING TWO OR THREE- VACCINES OUT THERE IT'S POSSIBLE THAT ONE VACCINE MAY BE MORE AVAILABLE IN ONE AREA ANOTHER AND ANOTHER AREA GIVEN JUST EITHER NUMBERS OR DISTRIBUTION. FRANKLY I THINK IN THE BEGINNING IT'S GONNA BE AN ISSUE OF HAVING ENOUGH VACCINE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY WANT IT. VERSUS GETTING- PEOPLE- OTHER PEOPLE VACCINATED OR A THIRD OF THE PARTICULAR GUIDANCE- THAT- BOTH TEAMMATES CNC EYES THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF- FOR HEALTH PLANS IN TERMS OF THE COVERAGE OF- THE- VACCINE. THE POTENTIAL. AGAIN NONE OF HAVE BEEN APPROVED YET BY STA BUT AT THAT AT THE POINT WHICH THIS HAPPENS. ASSEMBLY WILL BEGIN WITH THEIR REMOTE READYMADE C. YES AND WE ARE BETTER THAN ISSUE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AND INTO NOW AND- DEVELOPING A RECOMMENDATIONS AND GUIDANCE FOR HOW WE WOULD WHAT WE WOULD REQUIRE OF THE PLANT BUT WE EXPECT THE PLANS TO DO- IF THERE HOPEFULLY ARE MULTIPLE. VACCINES AVAILABLE HOW WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO COVER THOSE. OKAY AND SO MANY MORE SPECIFICALLY AND WAS MENTIONED AND IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT VACCINES AT DIFFERENT PRICE POINTS BUT THEN ALSO DIFFERENT AVAILABILITY DEPENDING ON GEOGRAPHY AND AMOUNT OF MANUFACTURING OF THE CDPH WILL HAVE PRIORITIES BASED ON. CERTAIN POPULATION GROUPS ARE CERTAIN WORKERS GROUPS AND SO FORTH BUT THAT IS FOR EXAMPLE IS- THOUGHT THAT- THAT- THAT SALE THE ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO COVER WIDER VACCINES ACTUALLY AVAILABLE IN THE AREA VERSUS SAYING WON'T COVER THIS ONE AND IF IT HAPPENS NOT TO BE AVAILABLE IN YOUR AREA EVEN THOUGH THE OTHER VACCINE IS. YOU GOTTA WAIT- TOO BAD THERE- I DON'T O I DON'T KNOW IF I DID THAT THAT. PARTICULAR ISSUE BEING CONSIDERED. IT CERTAINLY HAS SOMETHING THAT WE WHAT THINKING ABOUT AND TALKING ABOUT- OBVIOUSLY OUR PRIORITY IS TO. ENABLE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO GET VACCINATIONS THE QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THAT IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT IS ON OUR RADAR- YOU KNOW I. AGAIN WE'RE WORKING WE'RE STILL LOOKING INTO AND DETERMINING HOW WE'RE WHAT. WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE THE PLAN BUT I WOULD ANTICIPATE- WHERE NOT CONTEMPLATE THAT UP COULD. DID NOT COVER FOR A VACCINE THAT'S AVAILABLE. AT THAT. AND TIME- BECAUSE THEY HAVE MOBILE MECHANICS THE DOT BACK THE THAT IS AND THEN IS THE IN THE AREA AND NOW I MEAN ARE. IS THAT PLANS WOULD COVER- WIDELY ACTING FOR THEIR THE LATE BY AND HOW MUCH COORDINATION AND I'M GONNA DEAL I IS TO. HOW MUCH. IS TO GO ON WITH. I OF THAT- AT LEAST I REALIZE YOU YOU REGULATE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DROP THEIR HEALTH PLANS BUT THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ANIMALS. TERMS OF THEIR CHARACTERISTICS- HOW MUCH COORDINATION IS THERE WITH THE- I GOING ON TO BE SURE WE SEND A- SIMPLER MESSAGE OUT TO EVERYONE ABOUT WHAT'S COVERED WHAT ISN'T. CHAU AREN'T HELPING I TALKED TO BRUCE FAIRLY FREQUENTLY BRITAIN. I THINK WE TALKED MAYBE YESTERDAY. NO WE TRY TO COORDINATE- BUT WILL END IN THESE ISSUES THAT CUTS BOTH ARE REGULATED PLANNED THEN THE CD I REGULATED INSURERS OKAY AND- BRUCE HEINZ G. DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION GOING THE OTHER WAY. SIX CERTAINLY- AND I'M ALWAYS HAPPY TO SPEAK WITH SERRA THE- IN TERMS OF THE VACCINE. AVAILABILITY AND PAYMENT. THE FEDERAL- FOR YOUR ROOM FINAL RULE THAT WAS RELEASED ON. STATES THAT THE TAXI ITSELF IS PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IF. ARE D. VACCINATE. WHATEVER ENTITIES THAT ON CAN- NOT BALANCED BILL AND KNOCKED- CHARGED OKAY SO THERE'S NO COST TO THE PERSON WHO RECEIVES THAT ON INCLUDING UNINSURED PERSON AND IN TERMS OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE DIFFERENT VACCINES AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION ARM SO WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- AND THE GOVERNOR'S- VEXING TASK FORCE THAT THE IMAGE C. AS A MEMBER OF. TO OUR PROVIDE A STRUCTURAL GUIDANCE FOR HOW THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I PERSONALLY CANNOT IMAGINE A SITUATION WHERE AN INSURER IS GOING TO ONLY COVER A PARTICULAR VACCINE SINCE THE COST OF THE. VACCINE IS PAID FOR BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WELL AT THE A TEACHER'S I KNOW A LITTLE WITH THE NOT TO ABOUT PAYING FOR THE- BUT IF YOU'RE A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER PROVIDER YOU MAY ACT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH- DEPENDING ON WHETHER YEARS DOING ANY OF THE STORIES YOU'RE NOT ADMINISTRATION COSTS AND SO FORTH- IS THERE ANY- SO. IT'S GREAT THAT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PAYING FOR THE VACCINE ITSELF FOR EXAMPLE IT HAPPENS IN THE VACCINES FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM MEDIC CAL AND WE'RE TALKING MY SHIRTS COMMERCIAL INSURANCE HERE- WHAT DO YOU SEE IS GOING TO HAPPEN REGARDS TO- I GUESS EXISTENTIALLY ADMINISTRATION CAUGHT MINISTRY OF COSTS RELATED TO ACTUALLY DELIVERING THE VACCINE YOU NEED. NURSE TIME OR SOME HELP SPECIAL TIME THAT YOU NEED OTHER SUPPLIES AS WELL- THERE SO SEATED TO MINISTER TO VACCINATION- DTC ANY ISSUES IN THAT REGARD AND BEING SURE IF WE HAVE- FOR PREPAYMENT AND THEN SOME OF THESE. PLACES THEY'RE DELIVERING THE VACCINE DEPENDING WHERE IT'S COMING FROM- MAY NOT SHOW UP IN ALL THE DOCTORS OFFICES ESPECIALLY IN THE FIZER VACCINE IT'S STILL NEGATIVE SEVENTY SO YOU MAY HAVE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. WHO ARE THE ONES ADMINISTERING THE VACCINE- SO THERE IS A SEWER. TURKEY JUST MAYBE SPEAK TO SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING REGARDING- VACCINE ADMINISTRATION AND THE COST OF THAT BEYOND JUST THE COST OF. VACCINE ITSELF. AGAIN THE- LAW IS ACTUALLY VERY ABOUT- NETWORKS. HOME ISN'T RELEVANT IN TERMS THE- EXPOSURE RUFFIAN. PERSON TO ANY COSTS. MMHM I AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE INSURERS ARE GOING TO COVER THE ADMINISTRATION COSTS. HOME AND HE SORT OF ANCILLARY COSTS AROUND N THE- MINISTRATION OF THE VACCINE HAS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW AND THAT WOULD BE OUR EXPECTATION. OKAY AND- SERINE ANY ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT FROM DIMITRI. WELL I WOULD I WOULD ECHO EVERYTHING THAT- RETURN DATE JUST THAT WAY OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE PLANT WILL COVER THE MINISTRATION- IN THE RETAIL STORAGE- ALL THAT THEY ASSOCIATE COSTS WITH DELIVERING THAT ACTING TOO IN EARLY. OKAY THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD FOR ACTUALLY BOTH OF YOU THAT- NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE VACCINE BUT JUST TREATMENT IN GENERAL- SO- I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE KOPEN NINETEEN AND YOU NEED TREATMENT- IT'S- IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE COVERED- BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE IS THERE SOME SOME X. WELL LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS IF. THE IF SOMEONE SAYS WELL GOD WORKPLACE. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE IN A HIGH RISK WORKPLACES HERE. WORKER WILL HIDE IT IS A- AND GET A PLAN AND ACTUALLY WELL THERE'S A STATE REGULATED OUT OF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THAT'S A ITSELF. A SELF INSURED PLAN TODAY SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S A WORKERS COMP CLAIM. IT'S NOT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT SO WE WANT TO YOU KNOWGO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE TO GET. YOUR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THIS YOU GOT AT WORK- SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. TO THAT ISSUE FOR BOTH STATE REGULATED PLANS AND IF YOU'RE ABLE TO COMMENT. ARE YOU HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A NON STATE REGULATED PLANNED- IN ITS IT'S- THE PLAN SAYS DETERMINED THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY WORKPLACE. EXPOSURE OR INFECTION. AND THEN DECIDED TO SAY WELL ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT OUR THAT'S A- THAT'S A WORKERS COMP CLAIM AND NOT A- A. HEALTH COVERAGE ISSUE. YOUR AYE. THE END OF THE TERROR I CAN I CAN I JUMP IN HERE FOR. WE WERE NEAR THAT SITUATION AS SIMILAR TO- IF SOMEONE CONTRACTED ANOTHER TYPE OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASE POTENTIALLY AT THE WORK SITE OR IF THEY WERE INJURED AT THE WORK SITE- IT COULD BE HUMANE THAT THERE IT COULD BE A WORKERS COMP CLAIM BUT OUR EXPECTATION WOULD BE BAD. THE IF BE ENROLLING A PRESENTED AT THE HOSPITAL- OR AT THEIR PROVIDERS FOR TREATMENT REPUBLIC NINETEEN. THE TREATMENT WOULD BE RENDERED AND THEN IT WOULD BE BETWEEN THE HEALTH PLAN- AND THE WORKERS COMPENSATION KERRIER POTENTIALLY Q. FIGURE OUT WHO WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT THAT BILL RATHER THAN- ALLOWING THE PLAN TO. TURN THE ENROLLEE AWAY POTENTIALLY- THAT WOULD NOT BE OUR EXPECTATION ARE EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE EMBOLI WOULD RECEIVE THE CARE THEY NEED AND THEN BEING THAT WAY AND THEN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION CARE WOULD. FIGURE IT OUT ON THE BACK AND OKAY THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR THE INSURERS AND DRUG CALLED KERRIER. TO RESOLVED AFTER MAJOR OKAY AND SO THIS YEAR. OKAY THANK YOU AND SO JUST SO THAT WILL BE SURE THAT THE WORKER WHO'S ALSO THE PATIENTS IT DESN'T GET CAUGHT UP IN THE MIDDLE WITH EITHER COSTS ANY SOME SOME FOR COST SHARING ASPECT OR- OTHER TYPES OF- ISSUES THAT MAY ARISE WHEN YOU HAVE TO. INSURERS BATTLING AUS TO WHO WHO'S IS IT POSSIBLE FOR THE BILL. THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS NOW FOR ANY WORKPLACE INJURY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE TO YOUR PROVIDER. THERE'S A LITTLE QUESTIONNAIRE YOU FILL OUT SOMETIMES AFTERWARDS. WITH YOUR- EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS YOUR WERE YOU INJURED AT WORK THIS IS THIS IS NOT A NEW OR UNUSUAL PHENOMENON AND THERE'S A SYSTEM FOR. OKAY THANK YOU- AND ACTUALLY- FOR TRICIA A BLOCKER FROM THE FARM PUBLIC HEALTH APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT WHAT. HE- FANS ARE HER- TO GET VACCINES OUT TO THE PUBLIC- SO WHAT- FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND CDPH WHERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD DO IS A STATE IN REGARDS TO OUR HEALTH PLANS INSURERS THAT WOULD HELP FACILITATE- DATE BASICALLY PEOPLE WELL I GUESS DISTRIBUTION AND AT AND THEN IT WILL ACCESS TO AND AN ACCEPTANCE OF THE VACCINE AT LEAST RELATED TO ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED ORDERED ADDITIONAL THINGS WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP- FOR NEXT YEAR. TO HELP FACILITATE YOUR WORK AND- GETTING- IN VACCINES OUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- I THINK- AS WITH THE ENTIRE VACCINATION PROGRAMS THAT COMMUNICATION PIECE IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE- THE MOST CHALLENGING SO I THINK THERE'S- IF THERE'S ANYTHING. ZERO READ THE TO HELP US WITH THAT THE COMMUNICATION NODES- YOU KNOW THIS. YOU CAN GET A VACCINE AND- WILL NOT COST YOU ANYTHING OR OR AND THIS IS WHY. SO I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE MOST HELPFUL. OKAY ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY PREOPERATIVE LASTING TOO RIGHT WE WANT TO BE SURE PEOPLE. KNOW THAT THEY CAN GET THEY CAN GET IT AND- WE'RE NOT GONNA BE THROWING UP FINANCIAL BARRIERS FOR THEM. OKAY ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I STILL DON'T SEE ANY HANDS UP. CASING NINE I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS- THE FOR THIS PRESENTATION AND WE WILL NOW HAVE MOVE ON TO OUR- IT'S A REACTOR PANEL SO- SO AGAIN THANK YOU AGAIN TO SABRINA CORLETTE- WITH- GEORGE TOWN- MCCOURT SCHOOL PUBLIC POLICY SERINA TEAMMATE SEE. BRUCE HìNH Z. AS PART OF SHARON'S AND TRICIA BLOOD BLOCKER OF RED TO DEPART PUBLIC HEALTH. IF YOU ARE ABLE TO HANG IN THERE THERE MAY BE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL OPEN UP ANY QUESTIONS MIGHT WILL COME BACK TO YOU ON IN TERMS OF THE- AFTER THE REACTOR PANEL BUT AGAIN I WANT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. SO LET'S MOVE ON TO OUR- REACTOR PANEL- WE CANCEL. NEWS LET'S SEE ONE TWO THREE FOUR WE HAVE FOR A RESPONSE SO WE HAVE. DR DAVID THE BAR SKI- CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT UC DAVIS- HEALTH AND VICE CHANCELLOR AND I UNDERSTAND THAT HE WILL ALSO HAVE WITH HIM. DR TIMOTHY ALBERTSON- TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT NOT ACTUALLY TESTIFYING ON THE PNEL WHO IS ALSO- IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE AND PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE FINES ARE COPA NINETEEN VACCINE TRIAL UC DAVIS HEALTH. SINCE ALSO SPEAKING ON A PANEL IS- TRINA GONZALEZ- WILL BE COMING BACK FOR REFUSING HOSPITALS ASSOCIATION JEFF HORTON- SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT EMPLOYER COMMERCIAL POLICY AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND FINALLY DIANE DOUGLAS- WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA. SO LET'S GO AHEAD BEGIN WITH DOCTOR OF OUR SKI WELCOME. THANK RICHARD- CHERRY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. ABOUT THE COVERAGE AND DELIVERY OF THE CODE NINETEEN BACKSEAT- I'M SPEAKING AS A TRUSTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- AND ALONG WITH BEING THE PHYSICIAN CEO UC DAVIS HEALTH HOWEVER. MY VIEW SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS REPRESENTING A SPECIAL POSITION OF YOU SEE HEALTH- I DID BRING ALONG DR ALBERTSON WHO'S THE SMARTEST GUY I KNOW WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT VACCINES AND I EVER WILL IN CASE THAT HAPPENS TO BE A- SPECIFIC TECHNICAL QUESTION. ABOUT SINCE HE HAS HAD PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN ADMINISTERING THE PFIZER VACCINES. I'M OVER THE LAST WEEKS NEWS ABOUT THE ADVOCACY OF THE COPA NINETEEN VACCINE TRIALS HAVE BEEN VERY PROMISING AS A- DOCTOR AND MENTIONED- THERE ARE TWO MORE ON THE HORIZON. AND THIS WILL GIVE US HOPE AS WE NAVIGATE CODE CITY. AND REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS AT REMAINING SAFE OVER THIS HOLIDAY SEASON. AND WHILE THIS NEWS IS ENCOURAGING THERE ARE STILL MANY ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. BEFORE ANY VACCINE CAN BE DELIVERED EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. INITIALLY IN ADDITION TO THE PLANNING NEEDED TO DEVELOP ALLOCATION FRAMEWORKS TO COORDINATE VACCINE DISTRIBUTION AND ADMINISTRATION. AND COMMUNICATE ITS BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC. INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE VACCINE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR PREPARATION I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR EVERYBODY SEEMS TO BE IN AGREEMENT. THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. THERE'S NO QUESTION. THAT PAYERS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MUST PROVIDE COVERAGE OF THE KOBE BAXEEN FREE OF PATIENT COST SHARING. TO ENSURE THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO VACCINATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WITHIN LOW INCOME AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES HIT HARDEST BY THE VIRUS. ANY SUGGESTION OF A CO PAY FOR COST SHARING. WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS BARRIERS TO EQUITABLE AND ETHICAL DISTRIBUTION. FEDERAL GUIDE TO DATE IS ALSO ALIGNED WITH THIS PRINCIPLE SO WE'RE NOT. SAYING ANYTHING THAT ISN'T GONNA PRETTY WELL GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IN ORDER TO ENROLL AS A PROVIDER FOR VACCINE ADMINISTRATION THE PROVIDER MUST AGREE TO ADMINISTER THE VACCINE REGARDLESS OF THE RECIPIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. AND PROVIDERS WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM CHARGING CONSUMERS THREE MINISTRATION TAXI SO TEAMS ARE ALL THE SAME PAGE ON THIS. THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE SEEKS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT PLANS INSURERS WILL COVER THE COST OF ADMINISTRATION I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL WE WANT EVERY SINGLE PERSON. WORKING AS HARD AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO GET THE VACCINE OUT. AND TO SEE THAT DUTY AS ONE THAT THAT IS NOT A- CASE OF CHARITY BUT A CASE OF DEDICATION THAT IS REASONABLY REVERSES IT DISPLACES OTHER CARE THAT MIGHT BE PROVIDED. IN OPPOSITIONS OFFICE AND ASK YOU TO WRAP UP. SHORT WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE IS THAT THE STATE ENTITIES CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN EXPERTS. HAPPILY PROVIDED BY THE CMA AND OTHERS AS TRUSTED PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING GUIDELINES AND DISTRIBUTION PLANS. WE WANT TO REALLY MAKE SURE. THAT THE END PROCESS IS NOT ONE OF THE STATE LEVEL MANDATE THAT TAKES AWAY THE FLEXIBILITY THAT POSITIONS NEED. IN ORDER TO DECIDE WHICH PATIENTS. NEED FIRST BACKTRACKS SCENE AND HOW TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS WELL WE WELCOME GUIDELINES WE ASK THAT THE PHYSICIAN LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE INCLUDED IN THAT PLANNING AND IN THOSE GUIDELINES DECISIONS. TO BE A GUIDELINE AND NOT A MANDATE THAT WILL GET US WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PATIENT GETS THE VACCINE IN THE RIGHT ORDER AND ARE IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BEST MEDICAL CARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU TO THE RESCUE LET'S NOW MOVE TO TRINA GONZALES VICE PRESIDENT POLICY AT CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WELCOME BACK. BUT YOU'RE GONNA TO PAN- AGAIN AS YOU KNOW AS AS BETTER EVEN ARTICULATED TODAY THE CURRENT VACCINE COULD BE AVAILABLE AS SOON AS POTENTIALLY. NEXT MONTH DEPENDING ON THE FTA A APPROVAL. AND HOW. SPECIFICALLY WILL PLANT ROLE IN ADMINISTERING THE- DURING THE FIRST PHASE ONE HEH CARE WERE WILL BE PRIOR. THIS IS IN PART BECAUSE THE FIZER VACCINE SPECIFICALLY WHICH IS THE FIRST ONE THAT IS LIKELY TO GAIN APPROVAL. REQUIRE STORAGE AT AN ALL TIME LOW TEMPERATURE OF NEGATIVE NINETY FOUR FAHRENHEIT. IN ADDITION TO OFFERING A VACCINE THE VACCINE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND STAFF. MANY HOSPITALS WILL BE VOLUNTEERING TO SERVE AS CLOSE POINTS OF DISPENSING. FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES PARAMEDICS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS WHO MIGHT BE PRIORITIZE FOR THE VACCINE. IN ADDITION THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES HAS RELEASED BUT A FINAL RULE. THAT INCLUDES A VACCINE ADMINISTRATION COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH PLANS AND FROM MEDICAID SPECIFICALLY. THROUGH THEIR SCHOOL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES LABOR AND TREASURY. IMPLEMENT THE CARRIAGE ACT REQUIREMENT THAT NON GRANDFATHERED GROUP HEALTH AND INDIVIDUAL PLANS MUST COVER WITHOUT CARSHARING QUALIFYING COVERED NINETEEN PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES ALL DOSES OF ANY APPROVED COVERED NINETEEN VACCINE. THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VACCINE FOR ALL REQUIRED DOSES AND THE OFFICE VISIT DURING WHICH THE VACCINE IS ADMINISTERED. UNDER THE FAMILIES FIRST ACT THE OTHER FEDERAL ACT IN QUESTION HERE RIGHT NOW I'M IN IN DISCUSSION HERE STATES ARE ALSO ENTITLED TO A TEMPORARY SIX POINT TWO PERCENTAGE INCREASE. AND THEY'RE FEDERAL MEDICARE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PERCENTAGE OR F. MAP. ON THE CONDITION THAT THE STATE COVERS WITHOUT COST SHARING. COBIT NINETEEN VACCINES AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION FOR CERTAIN MEDICAID ENROLLEES. AND WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED THIS NATIONWIDE GOT THIS NATIONAL GUIDANCE IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THERE ARE STILL CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC GUIDANCE SO THAT WHEN THE VACCINATIONS BEGIN IT WILL SMOOTH THE WAY. FOR FRONTLINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND LATER THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE IMPORTANT VACCINES IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THE STATE TO DEVELOP SOME CLEAR PRIORITIES AND GUIDEPOSTS. AND ALIGN THEM WITH PAYMENT PRIORITIES. IN ADDITION NEW THERAPEUTIC AND NEW THERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS ARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE DEVELOPED WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE MAJOR ONES AND AT LEAST SIXTEEN IN THE PIPELINE. WITH GENERAL DISTRIBUTION STILL MONTHS AWAY AND IT'S CASES CONTINUES TO SURGE WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE NEW TREATMENTS WILL BE COVERED FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT BILL BECAUSE INSURANCE ARE NOT COVERING THESE NEW FORMS OF CLINICAL CARE. AS THEY COME ON LINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. NEXT UP WE HAVE GENET THORTON. A SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT PRODUCT EMPLOYER IN COMMERCIAL POLICY FOR THE AMERICAN HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WELCOME. THANK YOU SEVEN PAN ON BEHALF OF THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME- AND PLANS REMAIN COMMITTED TO HELPING OUR MEMBERS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY BOTH WAVING TESTING FOR COST SHARING IN TREATMENT AND PREPARING FOR THE EVENTUAL APPROVAL OF A VACCINE. WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO PARTNERING WITH POLICYMAKERS IN THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT THE CALL THE NINETEEN VACCINES ARE ROLLED OUT IN THE STATES AND COMPREHENSIVE FASHION. AS WAS MENTIONED INSURERS HAVE TO COVER THE VACCINE BOTH IN AND OUT OF NETWORK AT NO COST TO THE INDIVIDUAL. REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THE VACCINATORS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BALANCE STILL. WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE STA PROCESS IN THE E. C. I. T. FOR THE RECOMMENDATIONS AS WAS MENTIONED UNDER CURES INSURANCE PROVIDERS HAVE TO COVER THE VACCINE WITHIN FIFTEEN BUSINESS DAYS. BUT CMS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SEEN ALL THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE READY IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE TRUCKS START TO ROLL LITERALLY. HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT NOW ARE PREPARING TO WIND WILL PROVIDERS AND ACCEPT CLEANS FOR PAYMENT OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN ADMINISTRATION SEAT. IN SOME CASES WILL BE RECEIVING CLAIMS FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. ENTITIES THAT HAVE NOT TRADITIONALLY BUILD COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES. THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS WHERE WE STAND READY TO ASSIST. INFORMING OUR MEMBERS IF THEY NEED TO CREATE AFTER GETTING THE VACCINE AND WHERE THEY CAN GET IT. USING OUR AVAILABLE DATA TO HELP IDENTIFY PRIORITY POPULATIONS. HELPING ASSIST IN FOLLOWING UP TO MAKE SURE THOSE VACCINATED RECEIVED IN MANY CASES THE REQUIRED SECOND DOSE. HELPING TRACK ADVERSE EVENTS AND ALSO- GETTING READY TO WOULD THAT ADDRESS DATA CHALLENGES YOU KNOW IF WE DON'T RECEIVE A CLAIM WE MIGHT NOT KNOW THAT OUR MEMBER HAD RECEIVED A CALL THAT VACCINE. AND SO WE ARE CRITICALLY INTERESTED IN WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PART OF THE DATA AS WELL. AND FINALLY WE WILL SERVE AS A CREDIBLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON BOTH VACCINE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS FULL FOR PROVIDERS. AND PATIENTS AND OUR MEMBERS. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS WHERE WE CAN. FURTHER PARTNERSHIP WE AGREED IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO DO WHATEVER IT CAN TO MAKE DATA. I'M VACCINE ADMINISTRATION PLANS AVAILABLE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND WE AGREED THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE REGARDING VACCINE SUPPLY. KNOWS THE SIZE OF THE ALLIANCE THE TIMING OF THE LATINS WHAT WHAT WHAT'S COMING IN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHERE IT'S GOING ACROSS THE STATE IN WHICH PROVIDERS ARE BEING SELECTED TO ADMINISTER. THE STEPS. WILL HELP- STANDS FULL SCALE. OF WHERE WE MY RECEIVE DOSES IN WHERE MY MIGHT BACKS NAY AND HOW ENSURE THAT OUR MEMBERS JACKSON AND IT'S- WAY. IN CLOSING WE STAND READY TO US IN THE CAL RESIDENTS FAX. OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH- FINALLY WE HAVE DIANA DOUGLAS POLICY LET'S LEAVE ADVOCATE FROM HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND DIANA DOUGLAS POLICY ADVOCATE WITH HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION. AS CONSUMER ADVOCATES WE'VE APPRECIATED THE QUICK RESPONSE OF THE PANDEMIC ON PART OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION. HOWEVER WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT DESPITE MUCH NEEDED STATE ACTION FEWER STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE NOT LEFT PAYING FOR EXPENSIVE COST SHARING. AND ALSO DEDUCTIBLES THAT MIGHT BE IN THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EVEN FOR MIDDLE INCOME CALIFORNIANS AS WE HEAD INTO THIS NEW WINTER WAVE OF INFECTIONS WE SHOULD ALL BE CONCERNED THAT THOSE WERE BEING DIAGNOSED NOW- WILL BE POTENTIALLY NEEDING TREATMENT OVER THE COMING WEEKS. IT WILL REALLY BE A HOLIDAY SEASON PERSONALLY WHEN MANY FAMILIES MIGHT BE STUCK HAVING TO SCRAPE TOGETHER FUNDS TO COVER THEIR SHARE OF COST AND OTHERS MIGHT BE FACED WITH. THE REALLY DIFFICULT CHOICE OF WHETHER TO SEEK TREATMENT AT ALL AND MISS UNCERTAINTY OF WHAT THE COST MIGHT BE. WE APPRECIATE THE HEALTH HEALTH PLANS THAT HAVE WAIVE COST SHARING FOR TREATMENT HOWEVER IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PLANTS HAVE DONE THIS AND- REALLY MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE UNSURE ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'LL BE RESPONSIBLE TO PAY. AS WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER IN THIS HEARING CALIFORNIANS AND PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR WHAT THEIR COST SHARING MIGHT BE. AND AS IMPORTANT AS IT'S CLEAR AS IT IS TO CLARIFY COVERAGE BENEFITS FOR TESTING ALSO PATIENT BILLS FOR TREATMENT ARE YOU KNOW EXPONENTIALLY HIGHER SO IT'S- REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT FOLKS KNOW WHAT THEY MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOULD THEY UNFORTUNATELY NEED TREATMENT. WE ALSO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF THE VIRUS ARE ONE LIVES THAT WE MUST MAKE SURE ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR TREATMENT COVERAGE STAND AT LEAST SOMETIME PASSED THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. LUCKILY VACCINES ARE ON THE HORIZON COVERAGE FOR EXACT EXCHANGE MIGHT SEEM MORE CLEAR CUT BUT THERE ARE STILL CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER IN FACT ALL PLANS COVER THE VACCINE. OR VACCINES WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF THE FEDERAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION AND ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTERPLAY OF VACCINE COVERAGE FEDERAL ADVISORY RECOMMENDATION AND ALSO OUR GOVERNOR SCIENTIFIC REVIEW WORKGROUP AND HOW THOSE WORK TOGETHER. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE ANY OF THESE. QUESTIONS UNANSWERED WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE SHE'S NOW HAD ON SO THAT THE STATE'S READY TO MOVE. THAT CALIFORNIANS BE COVERED ONE SEX CAN BE DESTROYED. ESPECIALLY THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN BE CON. IN THEIR COVER AND GET BACK. BUT ANYHOW. WHATSOEVER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH- NOW WE'LL- GET READY FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS BEFORE WE DO MEMBER QUESTIONS I DO JUST WANT TO REMIND AT PEOPLE WITH- DEVICE. LIKE TO REMIND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND LIKE TO INVITE THEM. THAT THEY WISH TO PARTICIPATE THROUGH OUR TELEPHONIC SERVICE- TO PLEASE CALL AND NOW. YOU CAN PLEASE DIAL THIS TOLL FREE NUMBER EIGHT FOUR FOUR. TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR. AND WHEN PROMPTED USE THE ACCESS CODE EIGHT FOUR NINE SEVEN ONE THREE EIGHT. SO IF YOU CAN IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MAKING PUBLIC COMMENTS AFTER A TELEPHONIC SYSTEM PLEASE CALL AND NOW. WILL NOW MOVE BACK TO- BRING DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE QUESTIONS. FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MA'AM OKA OKAY NOT SEEING ANY CANS UP- I DID- IT DIDN'T PUT IT YET IS- TRICIA BLOCKER. THE STILL ON FROM CDPH. YES YES THANK YOU SO WE HEARD FROM AMERICAN HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF- DATA TRANSPARENCY AND ALSO THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK. AND TRACKING SO MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO IN YOUR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION PLAN- ARE YOU PLAN ARE YOU PARTNERING WITH FOR EXAMPLE HEALTH PLANS ARE OTHERS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TRACK WHO GOT THE VACCINE WHO HASN'T HAVE YOU SEE IN THE BEGINNING I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE. TO BE QUITE. HELLO DIMITRIJ DEMAND EXCEEDING SUPPLY- AND THEN OF COURSE I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON PLANTS PRIORITIZE. AND THEN ALSO IN ADDITION. IN TERMS OF- PROVIDING DATA TO PEOPLE ABOUT. HOW MUCH HOW MANY VACCINE DOSES WE HAVE AND WE'RE LOCATED AND SO FORTH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ALSO. TRACK YOU KNOW WHO GOT THE ONLY ONE WHO GOT THE SECOND ONE AND SO FORTH. SO CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO THE- DEPARTMENTS PLANS FOR. FAXING DISTRIBUTION RELATION TO PARTNERSHIPS WITH. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS FOR DATA AND DATA TRANSPARENCY. SURE THANK YOU. WE ARE. WELL AS I MENTIONED THERE ARE A LOT OF DATA REQUIREMENTS THAT CDC HOUSE FOR ALL OF THE VACCINATIONS THAT WILL BE ADMINISTERED- SO WE DID THAT WILL BE THE FIRST PLACE WHERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO- TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH EACH COUNTY WAS ALLOCATED HOME WHICH WAS ADMINISTERED- AND BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AROUND THERE WE'RE WORKING ON ON THOSE ELEMENTS RIGHT NOW AND HOW WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT ON IT IN A TIMELY WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE KNOWS ON. HOW MUCH VACCINE IS THIS-GETTING. ADMINISTERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO- MORNING THERE CERTAIN WORKING TO HAD. BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE- AND DIVEST THAT WE CAN AND HOW HOW AND WHO'S GETTING THE VACCINE WITHOUT- I. DISRUPTING ANYONE'S PRIVACY AND ISSUES- IS THAT SOMETHING YOU SEE THAT SO TO HELP ANSWER TALKED ABOUT THEIR POTENTIAL ROLE IN THIS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT- THE DEPARTMENT ISRAELI ENGAGED WITH THE HEALTH PLANS OR DO YOU SEE THAT ARE. EITHER YOU'RE DOING IT ARE YOU LOOKING TO DOING IN THE FUTURE. WE'RE SENDING OUT- ADD OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK WITH ALL STANDS IN THE IMAGE C. N. AND OTHERS SO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO COORDINATE WITH THEM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GOT A GOOD INFORMATION FLOW AND CAN. ADDRESS THESE THESE NEEDS OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND I KNOW THAT- ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS WORK LEVEL DATA- I DID HAVE A QUESTION ACTUALLY FOR- DOCTOR ALBERTSON- SHE'S ON THE LINE. SO YES SO GET IT SO YOU YOU ARE THE TRANSFERRED US TO CATER FOR THE FIZER COVED NINETEEN VACCINE TRIAL ALSO. MAYBE FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE DOING THE TRIAL A THEIR THINGS THAT PROVIDERS NEED TO KNOW AND THEN OF COURSE- THEIR MEDICAL GROUPS ARE HEALTH PLANS. IN TERMS OF. IT DELUDE STORING ADMINISTERING THE VACCINE OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT- WANTS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE AWARE OF AS WE DEVELOP POLICY FOR COVERAGE AND ALSO FOR- PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF TO SET EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD NEED TO DO TO EFFECTIVELY- YOU'LL RECEIVE AND THEN DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINE- AND I RECOGNIZE THAT. PLACES REQUIRES ALL TO COLD STORAGE SO MAYBE INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS WON'T BE DOING IT BUT MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO WHAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE SOMEONE ACTUALLY HAD TO ORGANIZE THIS ON THE GROUND WHERE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN IT COMES TO- ACTUALLY ADMINISTERING THIS VACCINE ON THE FIELD. THANK YOU SENATOR. THIS IS GONNA BE A HUGE ISSUE. I THINK THAT THE DATA EXCHANGE BETWEEN- THE- STATE AND THE PROVIDERS AND THE HEALTH INSURANCE IS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE KEY AREAS THAT WILL EITHER FAIL OR- WERE I MAKE THIS WORK- DAY TO. VACCINES THAT ARE CLOSEST TO BEING APPROVED HAVE. DIFFERENT INTERVALS BETWEEN THEM AT LEAST IN THEIR STUDIES ONE IS- TWENTY ONE DAYS ONE IS TWENTY EIGHT DAYS. SO IT WILL WILL NEED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT DRUG THEY HAD WHAT TIME THEY HAD IT WHAT LOT THEY HAD. IT AND THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY DYNAMIC BECAUSE THIS IS WE'RE TRYING TO RETURN TO MUNITY SO THIS IS GOING TO BE GOING ON. ALL OVER THE PLACE. SO IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT I THINK THE PROVIDERS ARE GOING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT. BUT I THINK WE WILL NEED INFORMATION AND- I'M HOPING THAT THE- DATABASE. THAT IS PROVIDED. GIVES THAT KIND OF HIM. AND MAKES IT AVAILABLE TO PROVIDERS I HOPE IT'S NOT A CURIOUS TYPE DATABASE THAT TAKES YOU KNOW FIVE TEN YEARS. GET TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY USE A CLINICALLY. SO SOME SORT OF INTERFACE WITH EPIC OR CERNER THE MAJOR IBM OURS WOULD BE JUST UTSTANDING- IN TERMS OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN- GIVING IT TO PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PATIENTS GOT ACTIVE DRUG OUT OF THE TWO THIRTY. NOT MUCH- PAIN AT THE SITE OF INJECTION MALAISE FOR A DAY TREATED WITH NONSTEROIDAL ALL GOT BETTER. SO I THINK I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR OUR REAL INFLECTION POINT TO. MAKE A CHANGE IN THIS DISEASE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. AND MAYBE JUST ANOTHER QUESTION- AND- RELATION TO THAT- WHAT IT COMES SO. WELL FIRST ALL I ATE PERHAPS IT'S SELF EVIDENT TO THOSE OF US WHO WHO ARE IN MEDICINE BUT MAY NOT BE SELF EVIDENT IS THAT WE HAVE MULTIPLE VACCINES THEY REQUIRE TWO DOSES YOU CAN'T GIVE ONE DOES ONE VACCINE AND GIVE THE SECOND DOSE OF THE OTHER VACCINE CORRECT. IS THAT WOULD BE MY UNDERSTANDING IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. WELL SO IS A PEDIATRICIAN SOMETIMES YOU'RE LIKE OKAY WE GAVE ONE HEAD THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT. SO THIS SO IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF VACCINE AND THEN ALSO THE COVERAGE OF THE VACCINE. THEN YOU'D HAVE TO ACTUALLY IF YOU GAVE ONE THOSE TWO PERSON THEN SOME PLACE YOU HAVE TO KNOW THERE'S A SECOND AS COMING. OR DEALING WITH. YOU DON'T EXACTLY CHANCE THAT YOU STILL HAVE A SCOND DOES AT THE TIME SECOND DOES IT DO RIGHT. AS YOU KNOW FROM YOUR PEDIATRIC EXPERIENCE- I WE HAVE A MOBILE POPULATION SO AND NOT ONLY WILL WE EDUCATE THEM AT THE TIME OF THEIR FIRST DOSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TRACK AND- MAKE SURE THEY COME FROM THE SECOND DOES. BECAUSE WE HAVE NO DATA ON WONDER WAS BEING- APPLICATIONS. CLOSER IT'S GOING TO BE HERE IT'S COULD BE A LOT OF WORK. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THOSE SECOND DOSES AND WITH THE RIGHT DRUG AT THE RIGHT TIME. OKAY AND DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF MAYBE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR- THE HELP. AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS AND MAYBE EVEN FOR TEAMMATES SEE IF- YOU KNOW COMING UP IN OPEN ENROLLMENT SO IT'S POSSIBLE WE COULD BE ADMINISTERING VACCINES WHERE SOMEONE GOT WIND OF THIS AND THEN THEY CHANGED PLANS. FOR AND THEN THE SECOND DOSE IS DO SO IS THAT THE SENATE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU FOR C. IS BEING A PROBLEM OR IS TO EXPECTATIONS VERY CLEAR THAT WHOEVER INITIATED. IS COVERING BOTH DOSES. SURE CHAIRMAN PANIC CAN SPEAK TO THAT SO JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY TO YOU THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A SEPARATE CODE FOR EACH PARTICULAR VACCINE EACH PARTICULAR DOES WHETHER IT BE THE FIRST OR SECOND DOSE. SO IN THE SYSTEM WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHICH ACTUAL VACCINE THEY GOT AND WHETHER IT WAS THE FIRST. OR SECOND. BUT IT. GRAYSON DOES. PLANS DO. HEALTH INSURER IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT WE WOULD NOT HAVE ANY RECORD OF WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL WAS VACCINATED UNDER THEIR PRIOR INSURER NOT. AND THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT- THE DATABASES THAT TRICIA BARKER SPOKE TO. ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT THE STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES CAN'T TRACK. THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT SITUATION HELP ENSURE THAT THEY DO GET THAT CRITICAL SECOND DOSE. OKAY NOW WOULD IT BE SIMPLER IF WE SIMPLY SAID WHOEVER COVER THE FIRST AT NINE WE KOW SINCE WE KNOW THIS IS A TWO DOSE VACCINE I DON'T WANT OTHER FUTURE VACCINES ARE GOING TO COME OUT- RELATED. IS THERE SOME THIS IS LADY SAID SIMPLY BECAUSE FIRST WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S PLANNED IN MY TO SWITCH TO WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHETHER YOU. WERE NOW ARE NOW AN INSURED OR WHATEVER ELSE- BUT AT THE END REASONABLE TO SAY WHAT WOULD YOU START OF WITH ONE THAT THAT HEALTH PLAN COVERS. THE WHOLE SERIES WHICH IS REALLY TO. AS A THAT MAKE THINGS EASIER. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR SO FOR ALL OF THE DOSES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PURCHASED THAT ARE BEING RUN THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED OPERATION WORKS FEET RIGHT THE VACCINATORS CASTS YOU BACKS TO MEET THAT PERSON REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE INSURED OR NOT OR WHICH INSURANCE THEY HAVE. OKAY THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO GET THE VACCINATION IF THE PERSON IS UNINSURED THERE'S GONNA BE A FINE THAT THEY CAN SEE THAT FUNDING TO GO FOR THAT VACCINATION ADMINISTRATION. NASA SO WHAT OF AND- THEY HAVE. WE GET THE CLEAN AT THE BACKEND OF COURSE GET A CLEAN FOR A VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. WE HAVE TO COVER IT UNDER THE FEDERAL AND- STATE FEDERAL LAW AND THE REGULATIONS THAT WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER HOPE THAT MAKES SENSE. OKAY LIKE FOR THAT PERSON IT'S VERY SEAMLESS. THEY'RE GETTING THE VACCINATION. NO BALANCE. OKAY ALL RIGHT- AND THEN I DID HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU. JEFF THORTON- SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT OF VACCINES IN TERMS OF- TREATMENTS AND THERAPEUTICS AND YOU MADE MENTION THE OTHER ART DIRECTOR A LOT COMING DOWN THE LINE AND I THINK WAS MENTIONED BY THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATIONS WELL- SOME HAVE. BEEN SAMPLE I TAX CLERK WHEN BASICALLY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS WHO'S NOW SAID- HAD RAISED SOME QUSTIONS. ABOUT THE THINGS WRITTEN LETTERS HERE. WHAT HOW WANTED TO HEALTH PLANS DOING IN RELATION TO COVERAGE OF DIFFERENT TREATMENTS AND DECIDING WHICH THERAPEUTIC STILL COVER OR NOT. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GREAT QUESTION I WILL SAY THAT A NUMBER OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE VOLUNTARILY WAIVED I CALLED IN NINETEEN TREATMENT COST SHARING THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND SOME CASES EVEN BEYOND THAT- BUT TEARS SPECIFIC QUESTION AROUND WHICH A SPECIFIC TREATMENTS ARE COVERED BY THE PLAN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE- ALL OUR PLANS YET VERY- CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICERS WHO LOOK AT THE DATA AND EVIDENCE TO HELP MAKE THOSE DECISIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR- INSURANCE PLANS ARE FORTUNATE SEMI QUITE AREA OF EXPERTISE FOR EXAMPLE WE DO KNOW THAT THEY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE AND ARE HELPING MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND I THINK. WE'VE BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING THE STA- TO SOME RECENT ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE LAST DAY OR SO HOW THEY MAKE THOSE COVERAGE DECISIONS JUST MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ANY TREATMENT OKAY SO BUT AND I GUESS AND- SORT OF FOLLOW UP TO THAT DOES- I MEAN I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE- MALE MEDICAL DIRECTORS HELPING PROVIDE. DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE AND ABOUT WHAT'S- HOW'S THAT COMMUNICATED DENTED THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY BECAUSE THIS IS A AGAIN THIS IS FAST MOVING RIGHT SO- DATESAND THINGS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE- A DOCTOR YOU SEEN THE PATIENT AND- YOU CHOOSE. A PARTICULAR TREATMENT AND THEN. THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR AS WELL WE JUSTICE LAST WEEK BASED ON SOMETHING AND AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO COVER THIS ANY. THE THOUGH WE COVER IT. TWO WEEKS AGO- SO HOW HOW HOW DO YOU SEE THAT BEING COMMUNICATED TO. TO PHYSICIANS AND OTHER PROVIDERS IN TERMS OF- THESE TYPES OF GUIDELINES INCISIONS. SO SHERIN DAN FIRST AND I HAVEN'T REALLY HEARD ANY STORIES OF PEOPLE. GETTING NEEDED COVERAGE FOR SOME OF THESE NEW THERAPIES COMING ON THE MARKET SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS COME ACROSS MY DESK RECENTLY SO I DON'T. KNOW JUST BECAUSE IT'S NOT A WIDESPREAD PROBLEM OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO I REALLY HAVEN'T HEARD. OF THAT DAY NOT A PROBLEM IN SOME OF THESE NEW TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN COMING. OUT AND SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN QUITE SHORT SUPPLY- IT'S BEEN A BIGGER ISSUE AS WELL I WILL SAY THAT IN GENERAL HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS REALLY WORK HARD TO KEEP THEIR COVERAGE POLICIES UP TO DATE. ON THEIR RECENT PROVIDES SEVERAL RESOURCES FOR THEIR- PROVIDE THEIR PROVIDERS AND WHICH SORT OF WHAT'S WHAT'S COVERED. UNDER THAT JONES. THE MEDICAL COVERAGE POLICIES. OKAY AND- I AT A THE BARS. DID YOU WANT MAKE A COMMENT ON ON THAT AS A- THE HEAD OF A- NINE YEAR OLD CMA AND ALSO AS A PHYSICIAN WHO. IS OVERSEAS A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM. WELL I YOU KNOW I THINK THE WHOLE KEY HERE IS YOU KNOW WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE. EXACTLY WHAT'S GONNA GO ON AND THIS GOES BACK TO MY PREVIOUS COMMENT I'M NOT TRYING TO LEGISLATE THINGS AS MUCH AS CREATE- EVOLVING GUIDELINES ABOUT WHAT'S BEST PRACTICES. AND IN LISTA CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION- IN THAT EFFORT TO MAKE URE THAT EVERYBODY'S DOING EXACTLY THE RIGHT THING AND THE RIGHT THING MIGHT CHANGE A LITTLE BIT- AS NEW- YOU JACKSON'S COME OUT AND- AND- YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION FOR EACH SPECIFIC PATIENT- SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT. OUT LEAVE IT THERE. OKAY TRAINING IS ALSO G. ONE OF MAKING COMMENTS. FOR THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ON THAT. SO I THINK- DELIVERS THE KIND COVERAGE A LOT OF THIS- AND AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS IT'S- THOSE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE JUST WANT TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT OUR PROVIDERS- HAPPENS OUT HAVE ACCESS POINTS AND ARE ABLE TO TREAT THE PATIENT AS AS THEY COME. OKAY AND THEN I STANDARDLESS I'LL GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD IS CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVE ADDED THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT- THAT STATE. FOR IN TERMS OF ACCESS TO TREATMENTS. SIDE VACCINES. I THINK AS FAR AS ACCESS TO TREATMENTS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT FOLKS- KNOW WHAT TREATMENTS ARE COVERED AT NO- YOU KNOW FOR HOW LONG ONCE A PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY ENDS ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE COVERED FOR. ANY ON GOING ISSUES- AND- REALLY I THINK RIGHT NOW THE NUMBER ONE THING IS JUST PROVIDING CLARITY WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO- PEOPLE SITTING AT HOME WORRIED ABOUT. BILLS I'M COMING OUR WAY AND NOT SEEKING TREATMENT WHEN THEY REALLY DO. OKAY THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THE RECOGNIZING THIS YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CASES WE EVEN TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEATHS WHICH IS OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND WHICH IS HORRENDOUS. BUT ALSO THERE'S MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURVIVED COVETED BUT ARE STILL SUFFERING FROM CODED THIS IS. I THINK SOMETIMES FROM THE LONG HAULERS. BUT THAT'S BECOMING AN EVER INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS WELL AND THEY NEED ONGOING TREATMENT- ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO- EFFECTIVE FOR THEM BECAUSE OF IT IS A PRE EXISTING CONDITION THAT THEY NEED CONTINUING CARE FOR- SO WITH THAT. IN MIND JUST TURN BACK OR THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. I SEE NO HANDS UP AT THE MOMENT. OKAY SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS AND I THINK AGAIN OUR PANEL SAID THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND FOR. ANSWERING OUR QUESTIONS HERE. AND SO AGAIN WHAT PRECIADO YOU TAKE YOUR TIME OUT AND- AND SHARING WITH US YOUR YOUR- PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTISE- WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO. OUR PUBLIC COMMENT.
