THIS FOLLOWS OUR LAST HEARING WHICH- HEARD SENATE PROPOSALS SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE TWO TOGETHER. R. WE'RE GOING TO FIRST DISCUSS HIGHER EDUCATION. AND I AM GOING TO- MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS BECAUSE I WANTED TO SET THE STAGE FOR EXPECTATIONS GOING FORWARD OVER THE COMING WEEKS. AS WE HEARD MULTIPLE TIMES IN SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE AND WE HAD HEARINGS IN FEBRUARY ON UC CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN THE ONE I REFERRED TO. THAT WAS LAST WEEK. THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACTS WITH UC AND CSU AND ROAD MAP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM REPRESENT AGREEMENT. BETWEEN THE SEGMENTS AND THE ADMINISTRATION WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE INPUT. ARE WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OVERALL EMPHASIS IN THE COMPACTS BUT I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCHES THE BRANCH THAT APPROPRIATES FUNDING AND GOVERNMENT SPENDING DECISIONS WITHOUT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND DELIBERATE DECISIONS THE SEGMENTS WILL BE UNABLE TO HIT THE EXPECTATIONS SET FORTH. TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF FACULTY STAFF AND ULTIMATELY THE STUDENTS. ARE QUESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS AND STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INFORMED OUR FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS AND IDENTIFIED HOW WE CAN PROVIDE DIRECTION AND STRUCTURE TO STRENGTHEN THOSE AGREEMENTS IN THE- IN THE BUDGET HERE AND IN THE OUT YEARS. ARE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTACTS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN CERTAIN AREAS WHEREAS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES. BLANKET 5% INCREASES FOR UC AND CSU TO MEET THE COMPACT GOALS THE SENATE PROPOSES TEN AND 14% TARGETED INCREASES RESPECTIVELY. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES NO INCREASES FOR THE ALREADY OVERSUBSCRIBED STUDENT HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM. IMAGE ONE THE SENATE PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHEREAS THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES MODEST. INCREASES FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL OUTLAY MODERNIZATION ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AND STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAM THE SENATE'S PLAN GOES MUCH FURTHER. ARE THESE ADDITIONS FOR STUDENT SUPPORT FINANCIAL AID UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENT OUTREACH. YLIDES AND RESOURCES FOR FACULTY AND STAFF ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE THE COMPACT STRONGER AND MORE COMPREHENSIVE- WE VIEW THAT SENATE'S PLAN. HAS A COMPAQ'S PLUS WE WERE THE PUSH FOR THAT IN THE WEEKS AND I WILL MAKE A SIMILAR STATEMENT OF COMPARISON. ARE ABOUT THE K. TO TWELVE PORTION OF THE HEARING WHEN WE GET TO THAT STAGE. SO I JUST WANTED TO START OVER WITH THAT LEVEL. OF CLARITY- SENATOR MEANT TO HAVE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. OKAY THEN WE ARE GOING TO MOVE- TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE HIGHER EDUCATION COMPACTS WITH. A UC AND CSU AND THE ROAD MAP WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM OUR PANEL WILL BE REBEKAH KIRK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JENNIFER PURCELL UP FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE FIJA VIRTON AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WAS AT NAVARETTE FROM THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND RYAN STORM FROM THE CALIFORNIA. STATE UNIVERSITY I KNOW WE HAVE CHRIS FERGUSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON STAND BY FOR QUESTIONS WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. THANK YOU- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY WE ANNOUNCED COMPACT AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE ROAD MAP AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SINCE THOSE AGREEMENTS WERE ANNOUNCED WE HAVE CONTINUED WORKING WITH EACH SEGMENT OF PUBLIC POST SECONDARY EDUCATION- FIND SPECIFIC METRICS. TO MEASURE THE PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOALS AND COMMITMENTS ARTICULATED IN THOSE CONTACTS OVER THE COMING YEARS. THAT WILL BEGIN WITH ANNUAL REPORTING STARTING LATER THIS YEAR FROM EACH SEGMENT ON SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT THEY HAVE PLANS TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD THOSE ACTIONS SPECIFICALLY QUANTIFYING AND MEASURING THE PROGRESS THAT THEY HAVE ACHIEVED. AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS THEIR STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS WITH THEIR INNER SIGNAL PARTNERS ADVANCING PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND BENEFITING STUDENTS OR GREATER AND SIGNAL COOPERATION. THESE CONTACTS AND THE ROAD MAP ARE DISCREET GRIEVANCE BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION EACH SEGMENT HOWEVER THERE'S A LOT OF OVERLAP AND COMPLEMENTARY GOALS. BROADLY SPEAKING THOSE GOALS WHICH TAXED ON THIS COMMITTEE AND THE PAST INCLUDED ENSURING THAT WE ARE MEETING THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE WE'RE CLOSING EQUITY GAPS BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO ARE UNDERREPRESENTED. LOW INCOME OR DISABLED AND THEIR PEERS AND THEY WERE BETTER POSITIONING CALIFORNIA TO MEET THE STATE'S CERTIFICATE TEAMMATE COLE. REGARDING YOUR COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING STRUCTURE WE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE. IN THE BUDGET PROCESS OF COURSE THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH THE CONTACTS. AND THE ROAD MAP IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS BUT FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS FUNDING THE REVISION. OUR COMPONENTS THAT WOULD BE ACTED UPON BY THE LEGISLATURE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT PROPOSED FUNDING. THE CONTACTS ON THE ROADMAP THEMSELVES ARE NOW AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE. SO WE ARE HAPPY TO BE SHARING THE ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND METRICS AT THIS TIME. I AM PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL MOVE ON TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. JENNIFER BETULA FROM THE L. A. ELVES SO- FACT CONTAINS SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR THE NEIGHBOR VISION CHANGES TO THE COMPACTS AND ROADMAP THEY DON'T ADDRESS ANY OF THE CONCERNS WE RAISED WITH THE PLANS BACK IN JANUARY. THEY STILL HAVE MANY MANY EXPECTATIONS EVEN MORE NOW THERE ARE STILL ON INCONSISTENCIES ACROSS THE STATEMENTS NO SPECIFIC COST ESTIMATES NO CLEAR REPERCUSSIONS. WHERE THE SEGMENTS NOT TO MEET THE EXPECTATIONS AND STILL NO DIRECT PRODUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. ARE YOU HEARD ABOUT THE NEW RECORDING A PROGRESS REPORT THAT THE STATEMENTS WOULD BE ASKED TO DELIVER BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE QUALIFIED. SO IT'S AN INFORMAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE SEGMENTS. OF THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE STATEMENT SOME PARTICULAR AREAS. YOU COULD DECIDE WHAT AREAS YOU WANT TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS AN AND THEN HAVE A CORRESPONDING REPORTING REQUIREMENT AND BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE OR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. CODIFYING THE REQUIREMENT WOULD. PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE JUST FOR ARCH POINT AS YOU MAY YOUR WAY THROUGH THAT OTHER ISSUES THIS MORNING ON YOUR AGENDA AS YOU ULTIMATELY BELCHER EDUCATION BUDGET PACKAGE. JUST WANTED A FEW TO SHARE A FEW PIECES OF INFORMATION FOR CONTACTS. WHILE THE STATE FOR PROCESS VERY LARGE THIS YEAR THERE ARE ECONOMIC SIGNS SUGGESTING A HEIGHTENED RISK OF A RECESSION GDP HOME SALES CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. THEY'RE ALL WEAK INFLATION IS HIGH THE LABOR MARKET IS TIGHT. IN THE PAST SUCH SIGNS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED BY RECESSIONS. SO BUILDING RESERVE EVELS ABOVE THE MAY REVISION LEVELS WOULD HELP YOU SUSTAIN ONGOING PROGRAMS OR THE STATE TO ENSURE RECESSION. THE SAY ALSO IS FACING SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET REQUIREMENTS OPPOSITION FOR RELATING TO THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT PROPS TO RELATING TO BUDGET. STABILIZATION ACCOUNT PROP NINETY EIGHT RELATED TO K. FOURTEEN FUNDING ALL PLACE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON THE STATE. THE MEMBERS LAMBS AN UNADDRESSED ALL REQUIREMENT OF THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN- TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WHICH WE ESTIMATE GROWS TO ANOTHER TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR ISSUE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. BY COMPARISON WE ESTIMATE THE STATE WILL HAVE A SURPLUS IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION SO LEAVING A LARGE PROJECTED BUDGET GAP NEXT YEAR. THIS MEANS THAT ONGOING PROGRAMS COULD BE AT RISK RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. SO WE JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP THESE FACTORS IN MIND AS YOU SELECT AMONG THE MANY BUDGET PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU AND DECIDE ON THE BEST MIX OF ON GOING A ONE TIME SPENDING. HAVE AN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL MOVE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. GOOD MORNING CHAIR LETTER TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND SAY OVER TEN AND REPRESENTING UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN AND BETTER SERVE STUDENTS THROUGH A FIVE YEAR FUNDING COMPACT THAT OFFERS RELIABLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR OUR CAMPUSES COUPLED WITH AMBITIOUS YOUR GOALS. RELIABLE ONGOING STATE FUNDING INCLUDES INCREASES TOGETHER WITH OUR TUITION STABILITY PLAN ARE IMPORTANT TO UC CAMPUSES AND COVERING THE COST INCREASES. AND ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS THROUGH MORE COURSE OFFERINGS ADVISING AND OTHER SERVICES. WE FULLY SUPPORT THE SHARED GOALS ARTICULATED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED COMPACT WHICH FOCUS ON ACCESS SUCCESS AFFORDABILITY AND INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION. THE UNIVERSITY CECE'S GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTI YOUR CONTACT AS A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND UNIVERSITY. ON THE WAY USED TO ACHIEVE THE OUTLINED AMBITIOUS GOALS EACH YEAR AT THE UNIVERSITY WILL TAKE STEPS TOWARDS THESE GOALS WHICH REPRESENT THE IDEALS WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO SEE A CHEAT. THE COMPACT INCLUDES ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND IN ADDITION TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE UNIVERSITIES PROGRESS TOWARDS YOUR GOALS. WE WOULD PROVIDE BRIEFINGS TO LEGISLATORS AND THEIR STAFF. WE WELCOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING ENROLLMENT AND THE REGION'S REQUEST FOR STUDENT SERVICES AND HEALTH EDUCATION AND RESEARCH FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU ARE. AND WILL MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LAYERED ON MEMBERS OF THE AFFECTED SUB COMMITTEE WAS EVER AT- SECOND LICENSE OF THE CALIFORNIA DREAM COLLEGES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT THE SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT STILL REMAIN AHEAD IN THIS BUDGET IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M GOING TO COVER AND THREE AREAS OF ALIGNMENT. IN TWO AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY- THAT- ARE AVAILABLE TO US IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AS WELL- AS ALIGNMENT WITH THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED ROADMAP TO CALIFORNIA'S ME COLLEGES ONLINE TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS GOALS THEY CREATE NEW AVENUES FOR DATA SHARING WITH THEIR UC AND CSU PARTNERS. CREATE CROSS SYSTEM COLLABORATION FIND RESOURCES IN KEY AREAS MANY OF WHICH HAVE- ARE ECHOING THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FROM PRIOR YEARS MORE IMPORTANTLY TO HELP US AS A SYSTEM CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON CLOSING RACIAL EQUITY GAPS. AND SUPPORTING STUDENT SUCCESS. WHAT TO APPROACH THAT'S IN. IN THE MAY REVISION AROUND A PORTION MEN'S AND STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WE- APPLIED THE APPROACH THAT REALLY LOOKS AT ELEVATING PER STUDENT FUNDING FOR STUDENTS RECOGNIZING THAT- BY PROVIDING HIGHER RATES. AND A BASE INCREASES STUDENTS YOU'RE NOT ONLY- ELEVATING KEY COMPONENTS AND TENANTS OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA BUT ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS CONTINUE TO DO THE RIGHT THING FOR STUDENTS HELPING THEM PROGRESS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO AN EDUCATIONAL GOAL BE A TRANSFER. DEGREE ATTAINMENT SKILLS DEVELOPMENT- OCCURRED ARE DECREASED YOUR CREDENTIALS SO WE DO THINK THAT IF THERE ARE AREAS- OF FURTHER INVESTMENT ADDING TO THE BASE FOR RATES- ISN'T. A VALID APPROACH. NOW AND A LOT OF WILL APPROACH. LAST I WANT TO HIRE- SYSTEM TO PASS THAT ADDED- TO. GOVERNOR'S ON MAY REVISION BY ADDING TWENTY SIX POSITIONS FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THESE POSITIONS HELP US IN SUPPORTING DISTRICTS AND COLLEGES AND ENSURING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE. REMAINING ON TRACK WITH THE GOALS AND THE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE EXPECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND BY OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE AS A SYSTEM WE'VE IN HARD- A MAJOR INCREASE IN PROGRAMS THAT WE ADMINISTER IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ADMINISTERED FIFTY NINE PROGRAMS WE'RE NOW UP TO A HUNDRED. AND FIVE- WITH LIMITED POSITIONS ADDED IN THESE- POSITIONS AGAIN ENSURE THAT NEED CAN PROVIDE DELIVERABLES THE KEY INFORMATION THAT OUR STATE LEADERS NEED TO MAKE IMPORTANT. DECISIONS SUCH AS BUDGETARY ONCE. HELLO I WANT TO HIGH- THE COMMENTS AROUND HOUSING WE DO BELIEVE THAT NOW IS THE PERFECT TIME WITH ONE TIME RESOURCES TO INVEST IN CUISINE. AND INVESTMENT OF THAT- IN BOTH THEIR PROPOSED AN ELIGIBLE PROJECTS- WOULD NEARLY DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF BEDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. LASTLY WE URGE YOU TO CONTINUE YOUR EFFORTS AROUND CAL GRANT AND CAL GRANT REFORMS WHILE THERE WERE SOME LAUDABLE INCREASES LAST YEAR WE KNOW THAT THIS SYSTEM OF CAL GRANTS NOT GET SIMPLIFIED ENOUGH FOR FAMILIES. AND ACROSS THE STATE STUDENTS CONTINUE TO MENTION FINANCIAL AID ACCESS IS ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY BARRIERS TO SUCCESS WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL TAKE THIS TIME AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO REFORM CAL GRANTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH JIM LEHRER. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WILL MOVE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM- GOOD MORNING- CHAIRED LAYERED AND SANDERS. I THINK YOU SHOULD ALERT FOR THOSE OPENING COMMENTS ABOUT THE CONTACT PLUS MUCH APPRECIATED HI MY NAME IS RYAN STORE I AM THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR FOR BUDGET FOR THE CSU OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR. NOW THE CONTACT IS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE FOR CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY SEE ISSUES FINANCIAL SUSTAINABILITY AND PREDICTABILITY. AND WE VIEW THIS CONTACT AS A CRITICAL SAFETY NET TO PROTECT THE UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY FROM ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ADDITIONS TO THE REVISED COMPACT THOSE ARE STATEMENTS OF OPENNESS PROVIDING MORE ON GOING AND ONE TIME FUNDING TO THE C. ISSUE TO THE EXTENT STATE REVENUE THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE'RE ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE ON GOING AND WHAT TIME FUNDING THAT GOVERNOR NEWSOM PROPOSED IN JANUARY AND THAT HE CONTINUED IN THE MEMBER NATION. WE SEE THOSE AS GOOD AS A GOOD START. THAT'S THE QUESTION POSED IN THE AGENDA IS THE AMOUNT IN THE MAY REVISION ENOUGH. THE ANSWER IS THAT IT WILL NOT FUND ALL OF THE UNIVERSITIES NEEDS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. FRANKLY THIS ISSUE COULD ONLY COVER SOME OF ITS MANDATORY COSTS AND ONLY SOME OF OUR ANTICIPATED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION COSTS CONTAINED IN THE TRUSTEES BUDGET REQUEST. AND WE CANNOT FIND MANY OF OUR OTHER PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET CRISIS LIKE GRADUATION ISSUED ANOTHER CAPITAL IN OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PLAN. AS WE CONTINUE TO ASK FOR THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING FUNDING ABOVE THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL FOR THINGS SUCH AS FAIR AND EQUITABLE COMPENSATION FOR FACULTY AND STAFF. WE SEE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ON GOING FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STAFF SALARY STUDY. THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY. THE STUDY REVEALED MAJOR FINDINGS IN THE AREAS OF COMPETITIVE MARKET SALARY STRUCTURE JOB FRAMEWORK AND PREDICTABLE AND IT WILL PAY FOR OUR STAFF EMPLOYEES CSU. ALSO READ WE REQUEST NINE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TYPE FUNDING TO HELP. US REPAIR AND MODERNIZE OUR AGING FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. UNLESS YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE SENATE'S APRIL BUDGET PLAN WHICH ADDRESS MUCH OF THOSE NEEDS. AND WE ARE VERY THANKFUL FOR- YOU ALIGNING YOUR PARTIES WITH THIS ISSUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS- OF THE COMMITTEE IN. OF THERE WAS ONE QUESTION IN THE AGENDA PACKET THAT ARE THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM CS YOU JUST. ANSWERED WHICH IS- IS THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION ENOUGH TO COVER THE ONGOING COST PRESSURES AT YOUR CAMPUSES IN UPHOLD THE AGREEMNTS. ARE IN THE COMPACTS AND ROAD MAPS THAT WOULD BE PUT THAT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND BEGIN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED- THE PROPOSED AMOUNT IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION IS SLIGHTLY LESS THAN THE AMOUNT THAT WAS REQUESTED BY THE REGENTS- SO IN THAT SENSE THE SENATE PLAN FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT WOULD HELP US COVER ALL OF OUR COSTS AND HAVE FUNDING LEFT OVER TO INCREASE STUDENT SERVICES AND ENROLLMENT- IF THOSE ARE THE SENATE'S PRIORITIES THAT WOULD. BE VERY HELPFUL AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOU CONSIDERING THOSE FUNDS- THE RELIABLE BASED BUDGET SUPPORT PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WHEN COMBINED WITH OUR CO HEARD FACED TUITION INCREASES WILL PROVIDE CAMPUSES SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO COVER THE NEW MANDATORY COST INCREASES AND INCREASE STUDENT SERVICES. A LITTLE BIT THE CAMPUSES WILL HAVE TO BE VERY PRUDENT AND HOW THEY BUDGET FOR NEW SERVICES AND THEY WILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR COST CONTAINMENT WITHIN THEIR EXISTING ENTERPRISE OF FUNDING STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. COVER ALL THE COSTS WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S FAVORITE VISION- I DO WANT TO ADVISE THE COMMITTEE THAT GIVEN THAT INFLATION IS INCREASING VERY RAPIDLY. OF WE MAY NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION IN FUTURE YEARS ABOUT WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH THE PROPOSED BASED BUDGET INCREASES IF INFLATION CONTINUES TO INCREASE AT THE SAME PACE AS IT HAS BEEN INCREASING OF THESE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS- BUT WE ARE VERY- THANKFUL THE GOVERNOR- FOR PROPOSING THESE. YOUR FUNDING- AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO OUR TO HOW TO MAKE IT ALL WORK. IN TERMS OF STUDENT SERVICES THE REGION'S HAD- THE PROPOSAL FRAMEWORK TWENTY THIRTY WHICH WAS THE CLOSE GRADUATION GAPS THE COST OF THAT PLAN WAS ESTIMATED AT THIRTY ONE TO SIXTY MILLION ANNUALLY. SO THOSE COSTS WOULD BE COMING OUT OF THE BASE BUDGET INCREASE THAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING- AND THAT MEANS OF THE CAMPUSES WILL HAVE TO BE A VERY JUDICIOUS AND HOW THEY ALLOCATE- FUNDING FOR THEIR EXISTING. EXISTING COSTS WITHIN THE CAMPUSES. THANK YOU BEFORE WE GO TO COMMUNITY- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE YOU SAID YOU YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT INFLATION THAT'S WHAT THIS HEARING IS THIS HEARING IS THE CONVERSATION NOW AND SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE DOES THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL ADDRESS THE INFLATION CONCERNS YOU EXPRESSED. FOR THE BUDGET HERE. YES THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL TAKES CARE OF THE INFLATION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND I WOULD THINK BUDGET YOUR PLUS ONE S. WELL OF BECAUSE THE SENATE PROPOSAL IS QUITE GENEROUS. SO WOULD ALLOW US TO ADDRESS ALL ARE BASED COST INCREASES INFLATION AND STUDENT SERVICES AS WELL AS ENROLLMENT GROWS. OKAY THANK YOU NOW MOVES TO THE- ORIGINAL QUESTION IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. YOU GERMAN LAYERED LOOK THAT NEVER AT WITH IT CANCERS OFFICE I'M OUR SEVENTY THREE DISTRICTS ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF ADDRESSING ONE OF THEIR PRIMARY COSTS PRESS PRESSURES WHICH YOUR STORES IN PERS PENSION. RELATED COSTS AND SO- IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER THE AMOUNT REALLY ADDRESSES THESE COSTS- INCREASES BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT START BUT I DO WANT TO- AND THE SIZE OF THE SENATE'S PLAN WOULD GET COLLEGES MUCH CLOSER. NOW TO IN ADDITION TO REALLY EMPHASIZING THAT THE PROPOSED SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION BLOCK GRANT SHOULD BE FIRST UTILIZED TO ADDRESS PENSION INCREASES IN THOSE COST PRESSURES AS AN IMPORTANT USE OF THOSE ONE TEN DOLLARS AND FOR LONG TERM PLANNING- I WANT TO ADDRESS ALSO COST PRESSURE FOR STUDENTS- THAT CONTINUES TO ESCALATE. FINANCIAL LADEN CAL GRANTS TO NON ADJUSTED WITH INFLATION AND SO FOR STUDENTS- THEIR COST PRESSURES ARE NOT KEEPING PACE AND SO ON A SENATE'S EFFORTS AROUND CAL GRANT REFORMER IMPORTANT AS ARE THOSE RELATED TO HOUSING WHICH COULD REMOVE UP FOR SOME STUDENTS OF THE HOUSING. UNAFFORDABILITY IN SOME REGIONS APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS THOSE QUESTIONS IN LET ME ASK ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH WAS ALSO LISTED. ABOUT FROM. WHETHER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THROUGH THE MAY REVISE IS PROPOSING. ARE COMPACT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN THE BUDGET AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE COMPAQ'S. ARE THAT YOU ARE SEEKING LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL OF OR SEEKING THE LEGISLATURE TO CODIFY. I'M HERE BAKER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS FOR THE COMPACTS AND FOR THE ROAD MAP. WORST ARE INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL AND THEN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IN SOME CASES FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THOSE WOULD BE ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE OR PROPOSALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE WE TAKE ACTION ON. FOR THAT THE FISCAL APPROPRIATIONS THEMSELVES- WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPECIFIC PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE OR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CODIFY THE REPORTING REQUIREMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTACTS OR WITH THE ROAD MAP THOSE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE PART OF THE CONTACTED ROADMAP DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES. THEY DO SPECIFY THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD BE REPORTING NOT ONLY TO THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO TO THE LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ABOUT THEIR PROGRESS TOWARD THOSE GOALS. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE ON THAT THE FUNDING TOPIC AS WELL. BUT THE AS FOR GENERAL FUND THAT ARE ENVISIONED FOR BOTH USED AND CSU AS PART OF CONTACT REALLY PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR THE UNIVERSITIES TO FUND THEIR ONGOING NEEDS ACCORDING TO THEIR PRIORITIES. AND THEY REALLY DO REPRESENT SOME OF THE LARGEST AND MOST CONSISTENTLY PLAN GENERAL FUND INCREASE THAT'S FOR THE UNIVERSITIES INRECENT HISTORY. I'M JUST ALLOWED RIGHT ON THAT POINT AS WELL OVER THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF THE COMPACT THOSE YEAR OVER YEAR PLANNED GENERAL FUND INCREASES OF 5% EACH YEAR WOULD BE PROVIDING YOU SEE ALSO THAT. AGGREGATE WITH MORE THAN ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ON GOING FUNDING AND THIS YEAR MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ONGOING FUNDING BY THE END OF THE FIVE YEAR TERM SO WE DO RECOGNIZE AND WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE PLANNED INVESTMENTS. ARE AND ALSO JUST REITERATING THAT OU KNOW AND THE GOVERNOR'S IN JANUARY ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT I'M GOING COMMITMENTS OF GENERAL FUND RESOURCES WAS TO BE AS COMPACT PROPOSALS 45% BASED FUNDING INCREASES FOR UC AND CSU. AND AS YOU'VE HEARD OF COURSE AND THAT RELEASED THE MAY REVISION. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ADDITIONAL INVEST CENSUS DATA A NEIGHBOR VISION ARE ONE TO MAKE. REALLY IN RIGHT OF THE NEED FOR FISCAL. LARGELY CITING IN MANY OF THE THINGS THE L. A. MENTIONED AND THERE PRESENTE OF. ECONOMIC INDICATORS THAT SUGGEST SOME VOLATILITY. AND POTENTIAL RISK OF FISCAL DECLINES IN THE FUTURE THEN ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION- I'LL JUST REPEAT A COMMENT I MADE IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING WHICH IS THAT. ARE NORMALLY- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF THE 5% AND OVER FIVE YEARS AS WAS MADE IN. JANUARY IN ANY NORMAL YEAR- WE WOULD BE CELEBRATING THAT AND JUST TRYING TO PROTECT IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS AND CALL IT A DAY. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE THE HIGHEST INFLATION WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF DECADES. AND WE HAVE SOME RESIDUAL COSTS OUT OF THE PANDEMIC. AND 5% DOES NOT KEEP PACE A SO FALLING BACK ON THE- ON THE GENEROSITY OF PREDICTABILITY OF THE 5% IS GOOD AND I RECOGNIZE THAT BUT IT DOES NOT KEEP PACE WITH WAS WHAT THE EXPENSES ARE. AND PARTICULARLY IN THE CASE OF CSU WHERETHEY ARE NEGOTIATING OF US SOME ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. THAT WITH REGARD TO COMPENSATION WILLBE VERY HARD TO DO WITHIN THE FIVE PERCENT. IT IS ACTUALLY A SOMETHING THAT IS THE REASON THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAS RECOMMENDED IT BUT THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION- I WANTED TO MAKE HIS. MMHM IS TO TEASE OUT A LITTLE MORE THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE CONTACTS BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED. THAT THERE'S A BUDGET LANGUAGE ON THE REPORTING. BUT IS THAT THE EXTENT OF THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THESE CONTACTS IF LET'S JUST SAY AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON ONE OF THE SEGMENTS DOES NOT FULFILL SOME OF THE DIRECTIONS THAT ARE CLEARLY OUTLINED IN THE COMPACT ENFORCEABILITY THEY REPORT THAT THEY HAVEN'T MET THE THINGS THAT HAVE SET OUT WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS TO ENFORCE THAT AND ARE IN FACT THE FUTURE 5% INCREASES AT RISK FOR ANYTHING THAT MIGHT COME OUT OF THEM. BEING UNABLE TO FULFILL ANY PART OF THE CONTACT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- WE WOULD EXPECT WELL I GUESS I SHOULD SAY FIRSTLY THAT THE COMPLEX AND THE ROADMAP ARTICULATE SHARED VISIONS AND GOALS AMONG ADMINISTRATION AND LIKE THE SEGMENTS. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF COMMONALITY IN THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SEGMENTS ACHIEVED AS WELL. AS FAR AS ACCOUNTABILITY YOU KNOW ONE WHERE WHERE VERY HOPEFUL THAT. THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS TOWARD ALL OF THESE CALLS INCREMENTS BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE INTENT HERE IS TO SEE EACH SEGMENT SIXTEEN. AND BENEFIT STUDENTS AS STRONGLY AS POSSIBLE- WE DO EXPECT AND MESSAGE IN JANUARY WITH THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THAT THE PLANNED YOUR EVERY YEAR BASED INCREASES FOR UC AND CSU WOULD BE PROVIDED CONTINGENT UPON THE SEGMENT'S ABILITY TO. KEEP DEMONSTRATE PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOALS AND COMMITMENTS IN THE COMPLEX. THAT SAID WE ARE EXPECTING TO LOOK AT IT MORE FROM A HOLISTIC GOOD FAITH EFFORT. TYPE OF APPROACH THIRTY REPORTING THAT'S ARTICULATED AND THE SPECIFIC METRICS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE. THE DETAIL COMPACT DOCUMENTS. WHY NOT NECESSARILY EXPECT ANY YEAR THAT THEY'RE EXACTLY A 100% ON. THE TRACK FOR MEETING YOU KNOW EVERY SPECIFIC METRIC FOR THAT PARTICULAR YEAR WE ARE LOOKING EXPECTING GOOD FAITH PROGRESS GOOD FAITH EFFORT. DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORWARD ON THSE GOALS THAT THERE IS. A TRUE EFFORT BEING MADE TO IMPROVE% UPON THOSE CALLS AND HIT THOSE TARGETS. WERE RECOGNIZING THAT IN SOME YEARS YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE CERTAIN AREAS THAT FALL A LITTLE BIT SHORT AND THERE MAY BE OTHER AREAS IN WHICH THEY'VE GONE. BEYOND EXPECTATIONS FOR THAT POINT IN TIME WE WOULD BE CONSIDERING ALL OF THOSE THINGS MORE HOLISTICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR THE SEGMENT- MAYBE A THE APPRECIATE THAT BUT LET ME TRY THE QUESTION A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY LET'S SAY THAT WHEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S BREASTS ARE REAL CONCERNS OVER INFLATION OVER NUMBER OF YEARS AND WANTING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. IF THE INFLATION MEANT THAT THEY WEREN'T MOVING AHEAD DIDN'T REAL DOLLARS- YOU WITH A 5% INCREASE AND THEN THEY COULDN'T ACHIEVE PART OF THE COMPACTS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT HERE BECAUSE YOU SAID IT SHARED A SHARED UNDERSTANDING IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD SORT OF ACCEPT AS A REASON WHY THEY WEREN'T MEETING PIECES OF THE COMPACT. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS FURTHER AND SEE WHERE THEY HAD BEEN ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS I THINK A NUMBER OF THE GOALS AND COMMITMENTS. YEAH DO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES BUT A NUMBER CAN ALSO BE ACHIEVED. JUST STRATEGICALLY WITH WITHIN A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THE SEGMENTS ARE YOU DOING IN WITHIN THEIR BASE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE TO SO. I EACH CONTACT AND THE ROAD MAP DOCUMENT BUILD UPON THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS GOALS THAT THEY ALREADY HAD AND THAT THEY WERE ALREADY MAKING SOME PROGRESS ON. THE FOR YOU SEE THE UC TWENTY THIRTY PLAN THE CSU GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND FOR THE CCC IS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS FOR EACH SEGMENT WAS WORKING AND HAD EFFORTS UNDER WAY AND GOALS ARTICULATED FOR IMPROVING A NUMBER OF THESE AREAS. THE CONTACTS IN THE ROAD MAP FOR THE BUILD UPON THOSE PLANS. BUT WE DO EXPECT THAT THE SEGMENTS WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE PROGRESS WITHIN EXISTING RESOURCES AND MANY OF THESE AREAS THAT THEY'REALREADY TAKING STEPS TO TRY TO DO SO. AND THAT THE PLAN INVESTMENTS WOULD FACILITATE THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT AS WELL AS- I DO SOME THINGS THAT OF COURSE YOU REQUIRE ADDITIONAL ONGOING RESOURCE THAT SEXUAL SEVERAL MACROS AT UC AND CSU. ENVISIONED IN THE OUT YEARS. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER I WOULD JUST TO BE. THAT IT STILL SEEMS VERY HAZY- LET ME. ASK IT JUST FOREVER EVERYBODY HERE AND LISTENING AT HOME. THIS IS OUR OVERVIEW OF THE ENTIRE HIGHER READ AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS AND- AND THERE'S BEEN SOME OVERLAP AND MAYBE THAT'LL SHORTEN THE- THE- THE NEXT DISCUSSIONS A LITTLE BIT AS- AS WE MOVE THROUGH. LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS ON THE OVERVIEW SENATOR MEN. I THINK SENATOR LAYERED- CAROLERS FASTENAL'S MY QUESTIONS I JUST WANTED TO SEE MY COMMENTS WITH HIS AND- ON THE INFLATION POINT I MEAN. YOU KNOW% GOING BACK TO ECONOMICS ONE A ONE THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REAL VALUE NOMINAL VALUE MORE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE 8% INFLATION OR OR SIX AND A HALF PERCENT OR WHATEVER IT'S GOING TO END UP BEING AT THE END OF THIS YEAR- I DO KNOW FIVE PERCENT. BASE INCREASE SOUNDS GREAT IT IS HISTORICALLY HIGH IN RECENT YEARS- BUT WE'VE ALSO BEEN DEALING WITH THE CENTURY A ZERO INFLATION ENVIRONMENT FOR THE LAST COUPLE DECADES- SO IN THE CONTEXT OF. WHAT THIS IS AS FAR AS A REAL VALUE- A 5% INCREASE LOOKS LIKE A NEGATIVE. I'M IT IS A DECREASE NOT INCREASE. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR BASE FOR- FUNDING HERE. I AND SO. I GUESS I AS FAR AS QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING. SOONER LATER TODAY ASKED AND I THINK THIS IS FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I HOW MUCH WIGGLE ROOM DO WE HAVE IN THESE CONTACTS IN IN YOUR IN ADMINISTRATIONS YOU. TO REVISIT THESE SHOULD INFLATION CONTINUE TO BE AT THIS PACE- SO WHAT'S YOUR VISION AS FAR AS REVISITING THE GOALS ARE REDUCING THE FUNDING. AND THAT WOULD BE FOR DEPARTMENT FINANCE. THANK YOU I GUESS THE QUESTION IS A COMPACT SET OR IS THIS SOMETHING UNIVISION IS KIND OF A ROLLING DOCUMENT THIS CAN BE SUBJECT TO REVISION AS AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE'RE ENVISIONING THE CONTACTS ON THE ROADMAP BEING FIVE YEAR TERM DOCUMENTS. THAT ARE PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE HOWEVER. YOU KNOW OF COURSE AS CIRCUMSTANCES EVOLVE OVER THE TERMS K. AGREEMENTS WE WOULD BE CONSIDERING THAT- JUST IN TERMS OF MONITORING EACH SEGMENT'S PROGRESS TOWARD MEETING THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. AND IF WE ARE SEEING LARGER FACTORS ARE AT PLAY THAT ME BE. OPPOSING CHALLENGES FOR YOU KNOW IN THE WAY THAT YOU'VE JUST CRIED PERHAPS ACROSS THE BOARD AND IN SOME OF THOSE WAYS. THAT WOULD BE A CONVERSATION WE WOULD CERTAINLY CONTINUE HAVING WITH THE SEGMENTS- AND WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE CONSIDER. AS WE CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD. HOW HOW DOES PROGRESS OVER TIME AS IT RELATES TO THE INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT AND THE PROPOSAL'S. OVERALL THAT WE FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND MAY REVISION. YEAH I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE YOU KNOW CERTAINLY WERE IN RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT THERE IS- INFLATION CURRENTLY THAT THERE ARE SOME VOLATILITY. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS WHEN IT COMES TO ADDITIONAL ONGOING SPENDING. AND MANY OF THOSE VALLEY- SPEAK SPOKE TO AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS HEARING AS WELL. AND JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE OVERALL NEED FOR FISCAL PRUDENCE WHEN IT COMES TO. ADDITIONAL ONGOING SPENDING BECAUSE OF COURSE KIND OF THE WORST CASE SCENARIO IS. COMMITMENTS OF ONGOING SPENDING THAT CAN BE FOLLOWED THROUGH UPON IN FUTURE HERE IF WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE EVENT OF A RECESSION- IT'S A MUCH MORE BETTER- IT'S A MUCH BETTER SITUATION. WHEN EVENTUAL EVENTUAL RECESSION HITS THAT WE JUST AREN'T ABLE TO IT IT ADDRESS OR INVEST ADDITIONAL ONE TIMERESOURCES AT THAT POINT IN TIME. AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO MAKE CUTS WHICH IS. AT THE SITUATION WE FIND OURSELVES AND IF PREVIOUS COMMITMENTS OF I'M GOING SPENDING ARE. ARE HIGHER THAN WHAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT DOWN HERE. I GUESS MAYBE POSSIBLY I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT RECESSION. RISK- AND DO YOU THINK THE- YOU PERCENT IS A SUFFICIENT GIVEN THAT WE DO EXPERIENCE EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT. I IN THE YEAR ENDING MARCH TWENTY EIGHT POINT TWO- IN DEBT I THINK THAT THE PARTNER LABOR'S PREDICTING SIX AND A HALF PERCENT INFLATION BY. YOU FOR YEAR YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO. IS 5% SUFFICIENT. WE JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THAT THE 5% YEAR OVER YEAR BASIS INCREASES ARE. AMONG THE STRONGEST OF THE SEGMENTS HAVE SEEN PARTICULARLY IN RECENT YEARS- AND THEN AGAIN AS MENTIONED AND WE'D BE LOOKING AT MORE THAN A BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW ONGOING FUNDING AT THE END OF THE FIVE YEAR TERM. IN THE AGGREGATE FOR BOTH UC AND CSU THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THERE AMONG. THE TOP THREE OR FOUR PROBABLY INVESTMENTS OF ONGOING NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND THAT ARE PLANNED IN THE FACT THAT OVERALL IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AND AGAIN I WOULD RE ARTICULATE THAT THAT IS NOMINAL INCREASE BUT NOT REAL INCREASE AND SO I'M BILLION SOUNDS GREAT BUT IF THE COSTS- THAT UC'S INCURRING GO UP TO BILLION OR THREE BILLION. I WILL NOT KEEPING PACE WITH INFLATION THEN IT CAN IT'S A NET DECREASE AND SO I WOULD JUST REITERATE THAT. MY SECOND QUESTION GOES TO. SET A COMMONS GOES TO THE POINT THAT CENTER LATER RAISED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY- WELL IT YOU KNOW WHEN I HEAR THAT YOU'RE HOPEFUL AND THE MINISTRATIONS HOPEFUL. AND WE'RE GONNA BE GAUGING THINGS ON A HOLISTIC GOOD FAITH EFFORT- THAT THAT KIND OF SMACKS TO ME OF I CAN'T A VERY HANDS OFF APPROACH AND I GUESS THE QUESTION IS ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR- PROVIDING COUNSELING OVERSIGHT HERE OR IS THIS THE ADMINISTRATION. EIGHT IN AND JUST TO DOUBLE DOWN ON WHAT CENTER WHERE TO ASK WHAT HAPPENS IF. YOU SEE. SEE ISSUES AND OR THE CCC'S. OUR YOU NOTE. SHORTER THERE. GOALS HERE NINETY MUSIC FACET. WHAT IS WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO IT OR YOU JUST LEAVING THAT TO US OVERSEE THE- GIVEN THAT THE CONTACTS ON THE ROADMAP RECOMMENDS BETWEEN GET MINISTRATION EACH RESPECTIVE SEGMENT. WE WOULD BE DEFINITELY VERY ENGAGED IN CONTINUING PARTNERSHIP WITH EACH SEGMENT AS THEY WORK TOWARD THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. LOOKING AT THE ANNUAL REPORTS QUITE CLOSELY THE COMPACT AND ROADMAP DOCUMENTS THEMSELVES ARE ARE FAIRLY LENGTHY AND GETTING INTO A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC METRICS. A BASS LINES AS WELL AS AN INTERMEDIATE TARGET SINGLES LEADING UP TO THE LARGER FIVE YEAR TERM GOALS. AND BEYOND IN SOME CASES SO- WE WOULD CERTAINLY BE EXPECTING TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SEGMENTS- ENSURING THAT THAT INFORMATION IS SHARED AND RELATED TO THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL- OF COURSE INFORMED. US OF THE SEGMENTS PROGRESS- AND- I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THE APPROACH HERE IS NOT USUALLY DISSIMILAR FROM COMPACTS THAT PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS HAVE ENTERED INTO WITH YOU SEE NCS HERE. IN TERMS OF HAVING A CONTRACT AGREEMENT THAT'S BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITY SEGMENTS- AND THEN MONITORING PROGRESS AND HAVING THAT INFLUENCE DISTRACTIONS BUDGET PROPOSALS FOR THE SEGMENT. AND MAYBE YOU'LL JUST MAKE IT MORE SIMPLE WHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN THIS PROCESS WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATING FUNDS- PROVIDING OVERSIGHT WHAT DO YOU SEE IS US DOING A WE JUST. KIND OF READING. THE REPORTS ARE SENDING US- WHAT'S OUR ROLE. THERE'S CERTAINLY ABILITY. WOULD HAVE ROLE IN ANY OF THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE UNIVERSITIES AND FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING PROPOSALS. SO ANYTHING THAT WE'VE PUT FORWARD. AS A PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OR ANY REVISION BOTH THIS YEAR AND IN THE FOR. COMING YEARS FOR THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD BE PROPOSALS FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION OF APPROPRIATION OF FUNDING. WE DO HAVE IS I THINK THE CSU REPRESENTATIVE MENTIONED IN HIS OPENING REMARKS THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MENTIONS IN THE UC NCS YOUR CONTACTS. ABOUT TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL STATE REVENUE IS AVAILABLE IN ANY OF THOSE YEARS. ADMINISTRATION WOULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ONE TIME INVESTMENTS PARTICULARLY IN HIGH NEED KIND OF CAPITAL OUTLAY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SEISMIC RENOVATION AREAS AND WE'VE ALSO MADE MENTION SPECIFIC. CONTACTS TO EXTEND TAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL STATE REVENUE AVAILABLE WE WOULD ALSO CONSIDER YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATURE WERE INTERESTED AND ADDITIONAL ONGOING FUNDING PARTICULARLY FOR GOALS SUCH AS ADDITIONAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH BEYOND WHAT WE ENVISIONED AND ARTICULATED IN THE COMPACTS. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AS WELL- I'LL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING I- I. WILL MY VIEW THAT I SEE. THE MINISTRATIONS YOU THE LEGISLATURE ROLES IS FLAWED HERE- YOU KNOW WE IF WE DON'T LIKE FOR EXAMPLE- THE FACT THAT TO A ONE OF THE- THREE BRANCHES OF EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION TALK ABOUT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOALS- IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL WILL. BE HOPEFUL AND TAKE A HANDS OFF APPROACH IF WE DON'T LIKE THAT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS. WE CAN JUST KIND OF ACCEPT THAT AND I THINK THAT. GIVEN OUR ROLE I WOULD I WAS ELECTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I REPRESENT MY CONSTITUENTS. I AND I DON'T THINK I'D BE DOING MY JOB IF I DID NOT ALSO TRY TO EXERCISE OVERSIGHT HERE- SO- YOU KNOW I SEE. YOUR VIEW OF OUR ROLEHERE IS AS PROBLEMATIC AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE THAT. PARTNER GOING FORWARD ON ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS CONTACT I AM THE CONTACT PLUS GOALS THAT THE SENATE IS ARTICULATED. I HAVE HANDS FROM BOTH WELL MY HEAD WAS REMOVED FOR FINANCE OF A HAND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I'M TRYING TO WRAP THIS UP BECAUSE WE HAVE EIGHT MORE. ISSUES TO DO IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS SO ABOUT ALL RECOGNIZE YOU THE L. A. L. JUST GIVEN YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE COLETTE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU ALL KNOW THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 5% INCREASES ON THE GENERAL FUND PORTION OF THE SEGMENTS BUDGET IS JUST ONE PART OF THE CORE OPERATING BUDGET THAT THE HOUSE WITH TUITION FUNDS MAKING UP A PRETTY LARGE SHARON THOUGHT SO IT'S MORE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE 3% OF A CORE OPERATING BUDGET INCREASED. FIRST YES YOU SINCE THEY'RE NOT EXPECTING TUITION INCREASE AS JUST ANOTHER THING TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AND TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THE BASS AND CHRIS SAYS OBVIOUSLY BUDGET ANNUALLY BECAUSE YOU'VE WANTED FLEXIBILITY TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THE CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS BEFORE YOU. YOU WILL HAVE A DIFFERENT INFLATION PRESSURE NEXT YEAR YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BUILD YOUR BUDGET ACCORDINGLY AND JUST THE ARTICLE SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE DEMONSTRATION IS ASKING YOU TO APPROPRIATE THE MONEY AND THEIR PLANS AND OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE EXPRESSING INTEREST WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN SEVEN EXPECTATIONS AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I THINK THIS IS BEEN A VERY GOOD HEALTHY DISCUSSION. I JUST APPRECIATE ALL THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE I THINK IN MANY WAYS. IT MAKES THE CASE FOR THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSALS PARTICULARLY. THE BACK AND FORTH REGULARLY ON THE FACT. THAT THE 5% IS DEFENDED ON THE FACT THAT IT'S THE MOST ROBUST INCREASE THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED IN YEARS AND YET IT DOESN'T KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. BY THE BY ITSELF COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM OTHER THINGS SO I THINK THIS REALLY LAYS THE GROUNDWORK FOR GOOD DISCUSSION OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS WE- OF LAND THE BUDGET SO I THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THIS. AND NOW. IF WE TOOK AS LONG FOR ALL THE REMAINING ISSUES AS WE DID ON THIS ONE WILL BE HERE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK TONIGHT. SO I THINK NOW WE START TO MARCH THROUGH IN A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A- EFFICIENT WAY AND WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS INCIDENT ISSUE TOO. IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WHAT HAVE. I HAVE LISTED TWO PEOPLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- LET THEM DECIDE IF THEY WANT THEM BOTH TO SPEAK. DANTAN OUR JENNIFER KACU. POSTING HOUSING FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ANALYSTS AT NAVARETTE. NAVARETTE FROM THE A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE MORNING SURE MEMBERS STAND OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALL GIVE OUR COMMENTS TODAY. BURKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LOCAL ASSISTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE LARGE NUMBER OF NEW INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. IN TWENTY TWENTY TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AS SUCH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE MAY REVISION FOCUSES ON PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT SUPPORT. THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA OR SCF OF. INFLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS WOULD BE EXPECTED TRANSITION BACK TO IN PERSON EDUCATION AND TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE ONCE YOU'RE ABOUT. TO THAT END THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES AN OVERALL BASING CREASE OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. FOR THE SCF SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO INCREASE THE FUNDING RATES INTO DSF AFT. AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO AUGMENT THE BASS DELEGATION. IN RECOGNITION OF INCREASING OPERATING COSTS INCLUDING THE SIGNIFICANT DIGITAL FOTPRINTS THAT DISTRICTS HAVE DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE LONG TERM SHIFTS. IN STUDENT LEARNING MODALITY DEMAND VARIOUS TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS PRODUCE AN ESTIMATED DECREASE. OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN POINT ONE MILLION TO THE HOLD HARMLESS RELATIVE TO WHAT WAS PROJECTED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE MAYOR VISION INCLUDES EIGHTY THREE POINT FIVE MILLION TO REFLECT THE BASE OR THE INCREASE. IN THE STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FROM FIVE POINT 33% OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. IS SIX POINT FIVE SIX PERCENT. RIGHT NOW IT MAYOR VISION AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION TO MAINTAIN FUNDING FOR POINT 5% AND LAWMAKERS. THE ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT PROPOSE STATUTORY CHANGES TO THE SCO OR THE STUDENT CENTER FUNDING FORMULA AT THE MAY REVISION. THAT ARE SEPARATE FROM PROPOSED. IS CHANGING- PROPOSED AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE ADMINISTRATION WILL MONITOR HOW DISTRICT ENROLLMENT FOR FORM AND EXPECTS THE STABILITY PROVISION OF THE SCF FIVE. AND SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT DISTRICTS FUNDING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. THE MARRIAGE AND ALSO UTILIZES SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME FUNDING UNDER THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE. TO PROVIDE A SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BLOCK GRANT. AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. WHICH TOTALS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. BOB GRAHAM FUNDS WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ISSUES RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. AND TO REDUCE LONG TERM OBLIGATIONS. OTHER ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDED THE MAYOR VISION ARE TWENTY FIVE MILLION ON GOING FOR ROUGHLY 5% INCREASE HIS STUDENT EQUITY ACHIEVEMENT PROGRAM. FORTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAM. A DECREASE OF FIFTY MILLION FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATE FOR THE STUDENT SUCCESS COMPLETION GRANT PROVIDE UPDATED CAL GRANT ESTIMATES. SIXTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING PROBLEM NINETY GENERAL FUND TO ALIGN THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ARE AS IRATE WITH THE SCF CREDIT RATING AS OPPOSED TO THE NON CREDIT RATING. TEN MILLION ONGOING ABOVE WHAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO AUGMENT THE NEXT STEP PROGRAM- WITH THIS INVESTMENT DEMONSTRATIONS ALSO PROPOSING TO REVISE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REMOVE THE STATUTORY CAP ON DISTRICTS. AND ALLOW ALLOCATION PROVIDED SPECIFICALLY TO COLLEGES- WHICH IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED. WE ALSO PROVIDE TEN MILLION TO ESTABLISH THE CONCEPT EMPLOYEE SOME ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE FUNDS FAMILIES. AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ONGOING TOBACCO DECREASE IN FEDERAL MATCH FUNDING FOR FOSTER AND KINSHIP CARE PROGRAMS. TURNING THE STATE OPERATIONS THE MAYOR VISION PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT SIX MILLION. NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUT THE CHANCES OFFICE TRIPLEX SEVEN NEW POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CRADLE TO GRAVE DATA SYSTEM. SUPPORT DISTRICTS TOWARD MEETING THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE MULTI ROAD MAP. THIS IS COLLEGES WITHOUT FOR OFFERING AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. AND BUILD CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE AND THE INCREASING CONTRACT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. RATHER THAN THEIR VISION SHIFTS TEMPLE POSITIONS POSTED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO BE FUNDED. STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR TO FUNDED STARTING AT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. BRINGING THE TOTAL BETWEEN THIS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND THEIR VISION. I'VE ALSO TO THREE POINT NINE MILLION FOR TWENTY SIX POSITIONS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING POLICY HOUSING WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. YOU SHOULD HAVE A HANDOUT TITLED. HIGHER EDUCATION MAY REVISION PROPOSALS IN FRONT OF YOU. PAGE ONECOMPARES PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING PROPOSALS OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BETWEEN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND MAY REVISIONS SO IT COVERS A LOT OF WHAT WE JUST HEARD FROM MR HANNIBAL. ALL OF MY COMMENTS TO A FEW MAJOR MAY REVISION PROPOSALS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. FIRST WE FIND MERIT WITH FOCUSING NEW I'M GOING FUNDS ON APPORTIONMENT INCREASES BOTH THE- ACOSTA LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THE COLORS. IN A REVISION AND THE BASIC REASONS BEYOND THE CALL. SO CALL HAS A BENEFIT OF HELPING DISTRICTS EMPLOYEES ADDRESS OF RISING COST PRESSURES AND THEN ADDING FURTHER FACING CREASES TO THE APPORTIONMENT WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA THE COLLEGES. WOULD HELP COLLEGES WITH THOSE HIGHER COSTS BUT ALSO WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF FUNDING MORE DISTRICTS BASED ON THE FORMULA RATHER THAN FUNDED ACCORDING TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISIONS SO YOU TINK IT WOULD CREATE BETTER INCENTIVES FOR COLLEGES. SIR STUDENTS BETTER IF THEY'RE ON THE FORMULA NO WE THINK PROVIDING A BASIC CREASES REASONABLE THE LEGISLATURE COURSE COULD CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AUGMENTATION AMOUNT FORCES SENATE DEMOCRATS. PLAN DOES JUST THAT THAT PROVIDE SOMEONE HIGHER AMOUNTS FOR THE US STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA THAT AND WHAT'S EVEN IN THE MAY REVISION. NOW OUT OF THE MAYOR VISION FOCUSES ONE TIME FUNDS ON TWO MAJOR PURPOSES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND A DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT THAT WILL ALLOW COLLEGES. TO USE THE MONEY TO ADDRESS LOCAL NEEDS. ALTHOUGH WE FIND BOTH PROPOSALS HAVE MERITS- AS YOU BUILD THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGING THE OVERALL STATE BUDGET PACKAGE ARE YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE THE ALLOCATION AMOUNT DEPENDING ON OVERALL LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. AND OF COURSE OUR OFFICE IS HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE COMING WEEKS I TO WORK WITH YOU AND STAFF AS YOU MAKE THOSE DECISIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SHOULD NOW MOVE ON TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. IN GERMAN LANGUAGE WAS THAT EVER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE SHE ANSWERS OFFICE. ANY INTEREST THIS TIME OF ONE OF THE LOCUSTS MY COMMENTS AND SOME OF THE TOPICS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COVERED- HE MET WITH THE- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THAT. ALLEY OWES OBSERVATION THAT INVESTMENT IN BASED RESOURCES. AND STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA RATE INCREASES IS A LAUDABLE APPROACH IT ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO CONTINUE THEIR FOCUS ON ACCESS ACTUALLY INTO. I TURNED MY MIKE. WELL YOU DON'T SEE IT. GROWING OUT OF OUR BALL A- THOSE SIDE BAR SHOULD NOT TUMBLE OUT OF MY MOUTH. WE THINK IT'S A PRUDENT APPROACH TO INVEST IN BASE RESOURCES AND- PER STUDENT FUNDING ADDED INSURANCE THAT DISTRICTS CAN CONTINUE FOCUSING ON ACCESS EQUITY AND SUCCESS. AND NEEDING SOME OF THESE GOALS AND THE ROAD MAP AND THAT WAS THAT ABOUT EXISTED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND ULTIMATELY THE RECENTLY ALL WORK IN HIGHER EDUCATION TO HELP STUDENTS MEET THEIR END GOAL. IN ONE TIME INVESTMENTS- WE'RE GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE'S A COMMITMENT TO PAY DOWN- THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION OUR CURRENT BACKLOG. IS ABOUT ONE POINT NINE NINE BARRING NO MAJOR COST ESCALATION ISSUES I'M SO INVESTING NOW- IN THAT AREA REALLY MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I AND WE'RE ALSO GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE ARE STILL A COMMITMENT FOR TECHNOLOGY MODERNIZATION AND SECURITY AS IT IS A MAJOR RISK THAT'S ON DISTRICTS STILL HAVE TO FACE- AS THEY ARE NOW HOLDING A LOT MORE STUDENT DATA THE FACULTY INFORMATION AND REALLY RELY ON TECHNOLOGY FOR BOTH. A STUDENT SERVICES AND ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT. LASTLY WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS IN ACADEMIC PATHWAYS AND STREAMLINING OF THESE INVESTMENTS REALLY ADD TO COMMITMENTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE THROUGH LEGISLATION OR IN PRIOR BUDGETS AND THEY JUST HOPE DISTRICTS ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ACTUALLY MEET THE DELIVERABLES. COMMITTED TO I WANT TO END BY AGAIN THANKING YOU AND THE SENATE FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING AND CAL GRANT CAN'T REITERATE ENOUGH HOW POWERFUL THOSE INVESTMENTS WOULD BE ON DECK RIGHT NOW IN ADDRESSING AFFORDABILITY ISSUES THANK YOU HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY. MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF ALL THREE THE AND LET ME. BEGIN BY ASKING OF. OUR QUEST OF THE DAY OF FINANCE IN AND ONE IS. ARM WE SHOW THAT DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS WERE MORE IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. ARE RELATIVELY AND HOW WOULD THEY BENEFIT FROM THE EXTRADOLLARS THAT ARE PROPOSED HERE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THIS BUDGET. I'M STANDARD ACCORDING TO FINANCE SO I WOULD NOTE THAT YES A LOT OF THE DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET ARE PROPOSED TO BE FLEXIBLE- WHICH ALLOW COLLEGES TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL POPULATION SO- MEDICAID OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THAT THIS THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION INCREASE TO THE BASE. AS WELL AS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR BLOCK GRANT WOULD PROVIDE DISTRICTS WITH THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BEST FOR THEIR STUDENT POPULATIONS- ESPECIALLY THE UNDERSERVED. OR- UNDIRECTED. BY THE- THEY WOULD ALSO NOT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT WERE PLAYING SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS INCREASING THE RATES THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. IS BEING ANOTHER INVESTMENT THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS ENSURING THAT DISTRICTS ARE. PROVIDED A STRONG INCENTIVE TOWARDS AND- INCREASING. BOTH THE AMOUNT OF ACCESS AND THE- CERTIFICATE AND DEGREE COMPLETION- OF ALL THEIR STUDENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE DIFFERENT I THINK IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS WEEK. A NEGOTIATE THE BUDGET AND MOVE FORWARD I ALSO JUST AS A COMMENT WOULD SAY- I JUST STILL THINK WRONG GRATEFUL FOR SORT OF THE TWO YEARS ON THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. THE WHOLE- FACTOR OF OUR COST OF LIVING- ISN'T NEVER GOT ADDRESSED AND ISN'T FACTORED INTO THIS AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME THINGS AROUND A STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WE'RE STILL GOING TO WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND THEN TWO QUESTIONS BOTH THE FINANCE. ARM IT WAS CALLED OUT THAT THE NEXT STEP PROGRAM FOR FOSTER KIDS- THE MINISTRATION AS HAS RECOMMENDED DOUBLING THE AMOUNT TO TWENTY MILLION AND US SENATE'S PROPOSAL WOULD DOUBLE THAT. AGAIN BUT THEIR EXISTENCE CAP TO LIMITED TO TEN CAMPUSES AND SO. IF THE MONEY IS BEING INCREASED I WONDERED IF THE ADMINISTRATION AND ITS PROPOSAL IS. ALSO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE CAP FROM THE FINANCE YES TO THE CAP IS REMOVED AS PART OF THIS- AND AS WELL ALLOWS FOR BROWN OCCASION SPECIFICALLY TWO CAMPUSES BUT HE GETS TO USE THE DISTRICTS OFFER FUNDING BUT THEN ALLOWS- ALLOCATIONS TO BE BASED OFF ON THE CONSTABLE. I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING TO BE HEARD FROM THE FIELD AS AS WELL AS- FROM FROM SENATE HEARINGS AND GOOD HOWEVER I WAS HOPING WE WERE DEFINED AS THE FIELD AND THAT OUR KIDS I KNEW YOU'D HEARD IT FROM US SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER. AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION. IS ARM DID MINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS FOR PART TIME FACULTY OF HEALTH BENEFITS AND I DIDN'T SEE ANY DETAIL FOR HOW THAT'S GOING IS THERE DETAIL FOR WHAT'S ATTACHED TO THAT AMOUNT IN THE MAY REVISE GONNA BE IS PROPOSED TO BE USED THE CURRENT- PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM METHODOLOGY THAT THAT EXISTS- I THINK ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE RAN INTO AS WE ARE DEVELOPING A MARRIAGE WHERE WE'RE THINKING THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL. IS A LACK OF ACCESS TO DATA A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE LANDSCAPE IS- ACROSS THE DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE STATE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR VISION THIS IS ATTACHED TO THIS- DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT FUNDING- IS REPORTING LANGUAGE SO WE WOULD BE COLLECTING INFORMATION FROM DISTRICTS FROM THE PROVISION OF HEALTH INSURANCE THE PART TIME FACULTY. AND SOME OTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THAT SO WE CAN HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IT IS THAT FOR LOOKING OUT WE- THINK THROUGH WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE MODIFICATIONS TO EXISTING PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM- METHODOLOGY I WOULD JUST OBSERVE THAT THAT SORT OF CHICKEN AND THE EGG BECAUSE OF IT TURNS OUT IT'S NOT WORKING WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A YEAR. AND HAVE THEM REPORT THAT IT'S NOT WORKING AND WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT BEFORE WE- APPROPRIATE THE MONEY AND THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT WE RAISED. OUR ABOUT SPECIFICITY WHEN THIS WENT BIAS IN FEBRUARY AND A COUPLE OF THE MORE- FOR. EXAMPLE THERE'S A MATCH THAT EXISTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND YET THE R. GATHERED THAT DOES THE AMOUNT IT'S PROPOSED HERE. WE WOULD COVER THE BENEFITS AND WOULD REQUIRE THE MANSION AND YOU HAVE SOME BAD JOKES THAT. ARE WORK AT TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES AND YET ARE ONLY COUNTED FOR WHATEVER THEY DO ONE CAMPUS AND ONCE AGAIN OUR SORT OF SCREENED OUT FROM THE ABILITY TO DO THIS. AND I THINK THAT THE AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION WAS THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S BEEN ADDRESSED IS MORE INTERESTED IN WHAT THE OUT YOUR COSTS ARE AND WERE INTERESTED ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS AMOUNT ACTUALLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE AND SO I JUST HOPE. SINCE WE HAVE FOUR WEEKS TO LAND THE PLANE ON THE BUDGET THATWE CAN GET INTO SOME OF THOSE DETAILS AND DRILL DOWN ON THEM AND REFINE THEM AND GET SOME MEASURE OF SPECIFICITY AND BEFORE I GET. TEN THOUSAND PHONE CALLS UP I SUPPORT THIS I REALLY WANT THIS TO WORK BUT I STILL THINK WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DETAILS TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW IT WOULD WORK WHO WOULD COVER WHETHER THE OUT YEARS COVERED WHETHER WE PROP THIS MONEY AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S MUCH MORE THAN WE NEED OR MUCH LESS THAN WE NEED. AND I JUST THINK THOSE ARE STILL QUESTIONS THAT ARE UNANSWERED AND I HOPE WE CAN GET TO THEM LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE'S QUESTIONS IN AND DECIDE ON. WHAT I'M SORRY WHAT WE HAVE A HAND FROM FINANCE WHO MIGHT WANT TO. THAN ANY ON. SO IT DID YOU ON HAND BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO RECOGNIZE YOU AND THEN. THEN HEY YEAH I WAS JUST GOING TO QUICKLY SAY THAT AGAIN THIS THAT THE JUSTICE BUT VIOLENCE TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHEN I FEATURED IN A TIME PROGRAM THIS WOULD JUST BE TWO HUNDRED MILLION TO AUGMENT THE CURRENT AMOUNT OF FUNDING SO. UNDERSTANDINGS OF THAT THIS TWO HUNDRED MILLION WOULD GO TOWARDS PROVIDING A STRONG INCENTIVE BUT- WE WOULD NEED TO REVISIT THE QUESTION OF FUTURAMA. AND I THINK THAT DESERVES A MEASURE THAT'S DISAPPOINTING AND ONE WAY BECAUSE I THINK IN FEBRUARY WE SAID WE DIDN'T REALLY LIKE THE WAY THE CURRENT PROGRAM WAS STRUCTURED SO NOW THE DETAIL COMES IN FOUR MONTHS LATER. AND IT BASICALLY PROPS UP THE PROGRAM THAT THAT MIGHT NOT WORK VERY WELL SO BOB. I JUST APPRECIATE THIS EXCHANGE- BUT I JUST HOPE WE CAN GET AT THIS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS TO MY COLLEAGUES SEVENTY QUESTIONS. THIS THEY'RE BOTH. SO- THANK. ARE ALL. ARE FOR THIS. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE JACK'S WALLED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. ADJACENT CONSTANT TORAHS FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND WILL WELCOME BACK SADIO. FOR TEN AND FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

ARGENTEUS JUST WHAT FORM IS JUST PLATFORM- PROVIDE STUDENTS SEEKING A TRANSFER WITH CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THEIR PERSISTENT AND- WILL TRANSFER WILL NOT TRANSFER TO A POTENTIAL INSTITUTION. I HAD AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND AT THE BACK OF THE PLANE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX TOBACCO TAX REVENUES I DON'T SUPPORT OF EXPLANATION OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR. MEDICAL EDUCATION YOU SEE- THIS AGREES WELL MAINTAINED A LEVEL OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION AT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS- THE MAIN REVISION ALSO INCLUDES A FEW CHANGES TO OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS AND PROPOSALS OPERATE- THE MOST NOTABLE- CHANGES INCLUDING.

IF YOU FOLLOW ALONG THE ALLEY- HANDOUT ARE. TO SHOWS THESE. YOU SEE A GENERAL FUND PROPOSE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NAY REVISION. FOR THE SECOND TIME I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON WHAT IS BY FAR THE LARGEST PROPOSAL IN THE REVISION WHICH IS THE U. C. L. A. INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY ENEMY IMMUNO THERAPY. I'M GENERALLY WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE THAT THE STATE- SPEND ONE TIME FUNDING ON. CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS THAT HELP ADDRESS MANY OF THE PRESSING ISSUES THAT. THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IN. THE PREVIOUS- MONTHS. THIS PROPOSAL IS A BIT OF A MISSED OPPORTUNITY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR SEISMIC SAFETY WHICH ARE KEY ISSUES THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT. IT DOESN'T EXPAND FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING WHICH IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS DISCUSSED IT ALSO DOES NOT APPEAR TO- X. EXPANDED NORMAN CAPACITY- YOU SEE AND THEREFORE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. ALSO BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACILITY IT APPEARS TO COVER SIMILAR SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT EXISTING THAT STATE FUNDED INSTITUTES ARE YOU SEE ALREADY UNDERTAKE. AND JULIAN MINISTRATION HAS NOT SHARED MANY KEY DETAILS AROUND THE PROPOSAL. FOR THIS REASON WE RECOMMEND YOU REJECT THIS PROPOSAL AND REDIRECT THE FUNDS TOWARDS OTHER HIGH CAPITAL OUTLAY PRIORITIES. I CAN THINK OF TIME WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS THERE BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THE PROPOSALS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ARM. WILL NOW MOVES TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA.

I DON'T BELIEVE IT IS CENTER HAVING EVER FOR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL UC BERKELEY. OKAY THAT'S GREAT.

IT'S JUST US THAT IF YOU HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED THESE AMONG THE SYSTEM'S HIGHEST CAPITAL OUTLAY PRIORITIES.

IN ANY EVENT THE SENATE CHOOSES NOT TO FOR THE MAY REVISED PROJECTS THE SIX THE L. A. AS RECOMMENDATION TO REDIRECT THESE FUNDS. TO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG WITH THE OPTION PREFERRED BY THE CSE AND GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE BACKLOG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS AND LET ME- ASK A COUPLE FIRST OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HOW DID- HOW DO YOU ENVISION A CSU ADDRESSING THE CARD COMPENSATION AND BARGAINING ISSUES WITHOUT A AUGMENT THE BASE INCREASE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION MISTER KERR- D. AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED EARLIER REGARDING THE CONTACTS IS SUBSTANTIAL YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASES PROPOSED THROUGH THE MULTI YEAR CONTACT SUPPORT CSU OPERATIONS PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AND PREDICTABILITY FOR CSU TO FIND ONGOING NEEDS ACCORDING TO EXPERTISE AND REPRESENTS SOME THE LARGEST ALL JUST AND I'LL JUST. I'LL JUST STIPULATE THAT YOU ALL MADE THAT SAME STATEMENT FOR EVERYTHING WHAT WHAT WHAT WE'LL JUST DO THAT AND ALL JUST TO BE LIKE THAT WE SAID INFLATION IS. AT 8% IN YOUR PROPOSALS AT FIVE AND- EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH IT. OF THE OTHER QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK FOR FINANCE IS. ARM IT WAS MENTIONED OF FOSTER YOUTH AUGMENTATION FOR CSU EAST BAY AND NORTHRIDGE AND I WAS CURIOUS WHY THOSE TWO CAMPUSES WERE SINGLED OUT AND WHETHER THERE WERE NEEDS AT OTHER CAMPUSES OR WHETHER WAS A COMPETITIVE PROCESS- WHAT WAS THE PROCESS LEADING UP TO A RECOMMENDATION FOR JUST THOSE TWO CAMPUSES. ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MR CARE. THE FIRST ARE COUNTING HE'S CURRENTLY SIR FOURTEEN CAMPUSES. NATIONWIDE AND FOR CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY THE CABINETS ARE CURRENTLY ESTABLISH AT UCLA CSU SAMBAR DINO AND AS SACRAMENTO STATE UNIVERSITY WITH THE LADDER- FROM FOR SACRAMENTO STATE BEING FUNDED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACT. ON A ONE TIME BASIS THE MEMBER VISION PROPOSES PROPOSES ONE TERM RESOURCES TO ESTABLISH THE FIRST STARK HORROR AT EASTBAY AND NORTHRIDGE TO EXPAND THE PROGRAMS REACH AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDE NEW COHORTS TO POPULOUS AREAS IN BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OKAY MORE WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM CENTER ROAD CHAU BOGAN WAITING TO SEE IF SENATOR MAN HAS ANY QUESTIONS YEAH I GUESS I GUESS I JUST WANNA GO OUT AND FOLLOW UP ON ON SENATORS WITH LETTERS QUESTION AND THIS APPLIES FOR BOTH THE UC'S NCS USING THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A IN RECENT MONTHS SINCE THE ORIGINAL JANUARY BUDGET SEEN BOTH- SIGNS OF LINGERING HIGH INFLATION. I AS WELL AS INCREASES IN THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE SURPLUS AMOUNT- WHAT WAS THAT. ADMINISTRATION'S RATIONALE IN NOT INCREASING EITHER THAT THE BASE INCREASE OR WHAT I SEE IS A RELATIVELY PALTRY INVESTMENT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AS COMPARED TO THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL. AND WHO DOES YOUR PARTNER RECREATIONS DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS WHAT WHY WHY DIDN'T YOU GUYS INCREASE WHY ARE. WHY IS THE STATE SENATE'S PROPOSAL SO MUCH HIGHER THAN YOURS GIVEN THAT WE'VE SEEN A REALLY MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE SURPLUS- AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN. FAIRLY HIGH INFLATION AND SIGNS THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE AROUND FOR SOME TIME- WHY DID WHY DID ADMINISTRATION CHOOSE NOT TO INCREASE THE BASE INCREASE- AND AGAIN MAKE A- RELATIVELY MODEST INVESTMENT FOR MAINTENANCE WHEN WE KNOW THAT THIS YEAR'S USING UC'S HAVE HAD VERY SIGNIFICANT. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS. JENNIFER THE WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE COMPACT AGREEMENT REGARDING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BUT I WILL. SPEAK TO. THE MINISTRATIONS AGREEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY- THE MINISTRATION OF REAFFIRMS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OF THE SUBSTANTIAL 5% YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE AS MY COLLEAGUE REBECCA KIRK IN. FINANCE HAD MENTIONED EARLIER AND WHILE THEM THE MINISTRATION DOES HAVE AN AGREEMENT IT IS THE STARTING POINT. FOR SUBSEQUENT BUDGETS AND THEN- FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS DURING THE TERMS OF THAT COMPACT- WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT LEGISLATORS ROLE OF AS PART OF THE TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS DISCUSSION. I THINK WE'RE JUST HAVING THE SAME DISCUSSION AGAIN SO I APPRECIATE THAT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ON THE- OF THE CSU SYSTEM. SEEING NONE LET ME THANK OUR WITNESSES WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE THE NEW AND JUSTICE PEOPLE IT JUST JOINED RECENTLY WE HAD A RATHER ROBUST DISCUSSION ON ALL THREE LEVELS OF HIGHER READ AND TE SITUATION AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE WE WENT TO THE INDIVIDUALS ARE SEGMENTS OF DON'T THINK WE'RE BRUSHING BY THIS QUICKLY. ARE WILL GO TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE- WHICH IS VARIOUS PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISE- AND IT IT'S RELATED TO THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WILL HEAR FROM GABRIELA CHAVEZ OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LISA CAME FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SUBJECT BREMNER FROM THE- CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D NEVER LET CHÁVEZ WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL BEGIN MY PRESENTATION TODAY BY GOING OVER SOME CHANGES IN THE CONFERENCE IN A COMMISSION'S BUDGET. AND SOME TRANSCEND THE COCHRAN PROGRAM. IN THE REVISIONS FOR THE CURRENT PROGRAM. THANKS AN ESTIMATED DECREASE OF TWO HUNDRED. EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. IN A DECREASE OF THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THIS IS BASED ON REVISED ESTIMATES OF NEW RENEWAL COCHRAN WHAT HE'S- THIS INCREMENTAL CASE THAT ADJUSTMENTS REFLECT MODEST OVER YEARS OF GROWTH IN THIS COMMITTEE CONTEXT MANAGERS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTIONS. SIMILARLY AS WE OBSERVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE LAST THREE YEARS CHAU IN MORE MODEST YEAR OVER YEAR GROWTH THIS GATE WAS THE CLIENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO LOWER RATE LASTLY AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE COMPANY STATE UNIVERSITY. THAT JUST MEANT IS ALSO A REFLECTION OFFER CONTINUED EFFORTS- TO GET A BETTER INFORMATION FOR ME. HIS I'M A REVISION IT WOULD RECEIVE BETTER ESTIMATES FOR- AARON YOU STUDENTS AND AS WE HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT COMPANY COMMUNITY COLLEGE EXPANSION PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE BETTER ESTIMATES. ONE NINETEEN ANY CONTINUES TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT IN A MOMENT. THE FINANCE BELIEVES THAT THESE THE CLIENTS HAD TEMPORARILY WE WILL SEE THE TRANSVERSE AND IN YOUR FRIDGE. ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND ONGOING GENERAL FUND. AND THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS AND THOSE AMENDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. NUMBER RIGHT BUT AT SOME OF THE TRILOGY THAT WERE PROPOSED IN FOR ME REVISION. LET ME PROVISIONAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT IS PALATABLE MORE DYNAMIC SYSTEM TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER COMMITMENTS. MADE BY MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE CRITERIA BY WHICH THIS INSTITUTIONS CAN MAINTAIN THE CURRENT NO WORK AND NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY. IN THE ABSENCE OF TIME I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY IN BECAUSE OF THE RIVER BEHIND CLOSED SEVERAL TECHNICAL TRAILER BILL. TO AMEND THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM SHE SAID THE GRANT PROGRAM AND THE STUDENT LOAN PAYMENT BEFORE THE FOUR RATE ENCOURAGE. I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THOSE FIGHTERS AB HOW ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MOVE ON TO THE- ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU. IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG THE L. A- HANDOUT IN YOUR VISION PROPOSALS FOR DESTINY CHRISTIAN APPEAR ON PAGE FOUR. I FOR THE PERMANENT FINANCE NOTED THAT LARGEST ADJUSTMENT IS ADD DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO THE COST ESTIMATE FOR THE HEALTHCARE GRANT. WE THINK THAT THE REVISED COST ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE BASED ON THE MOST RECENT PROGRAM DATA AVAILABLE. WE ALSO RECOMMEND APPROVING THE THREE NEARLY BECAUSE CONDITIONS INCLUDING MAYOR VISIONS. THE COMMISSION HAS THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE FINANCIALLY EXTENSIONS ENACTED LAST. REGARDING THE MANY TRAILER BILL PROPOSALS FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IN JUST A TIME I WILL WALK THROUGH ALL OF THE ONE THAT WE HAVE THE MOST NOTABLE CONCERNS WHICH RELATES TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM. WHICH I BELIEVE WILL BE HEARD LATER THIS MORNING AS PART OF THE COUPON SECTION. AND HAVING SAID WE HAVE TO TAKE QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO THE- CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION. GOOD MORNING SURE LAYERED AND SENATORS JAKE BRUNNER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT AID COMMISSION A GOOD TO BE WITH YOU- THIS MORNING I SHOULD NOTE AS A DISCLAIMER OF RECEIVED AND- CONNECTION UNSTABLE WARNING FROM ZOOM SO HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME ALL RIGHT. BUT WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST FINE AN AFTER MY- MY FAUX PAS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S PERSON I WILL NOT BE COMMENTING ON YOUR UNSTABLE CONNECTION. GREAT WELL I'M MEETING LOT OF CLEAR FOR NOW- ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU I'M ACTUALLY YOUR OPENING COMMENTS CHAIR LAYERED- IN WHICH HE NOTED SEVERAL ELEMENTS AND THE PROPS ARE MISSING FROM THE MAY REVISION THAT WOULD HELP US BETTER SERVE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS I SUGGEST ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT THAT WE WOULD AT THE COMMISSION HOPE TO SEE REFLECTED IN THE FINAL ADOPTED BUDGET FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR WOULD BE REFORM OF THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. WHAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP US FURTHER OUR WORK TOWARDS CREATING DEBT FREE PATHWAYS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS BUT WILL ALSO HELP FURTHER THE GOALS THAT ARTICULATED IN A COMPACT AND THE COMPACT PLUS- WE KNOW THAT HAS SPARKED COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERS ALLUDED TO THAT- STUDENTS ARE CHOOSING NOT TO ENROLL IN LARGE PART DUE TO AFFORDABILITY AND SURVEY DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED THAT CITED AS THE TOP- CONCERN THAT PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS HAVE WE ALSO KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT. RECEIPT OF A CAL GRANT DOES NOT EMPOWER OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO COMPLETE MORE UNITS IN A YEAR AND A PERSISTENT HIGHER RATES AND OF COURSE- THERE'S ADDITIONAL SURVEY DATA THAT DEMONSTRATE THAT THE STUDENTS THAT I HAVE MOST EXPERIENCED COST INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF THE COMING NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS- SO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE TO ENACT HEALTH REFORM AND THIS YEAR'S. BUDGET ALTER MY COMMENTS NOW TO THE OF RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR IN THE MAY REVISION- TOWARDS- THIS UNIQUE COMMISSIONS ADMINISTRATION ON OUR PROGRAMS WE'RE CERTAINLY GRATEFUL FOR THE RECOGNITION OF A GREATER CAPACITY NEEDS OUT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND FOR THIS TOTAL OF EIGHT NEW POSITIONS HOWEVER WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES OUR RESOURCES NEEDED TO MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY EXPERIENCES FOR STUDENTS CAMPUS PARTNERS AND STAFF IN OUR INITIAL REQUEST STUDENT MISSION I THOUGHT TWENTY SEVEN POSITIONS AS WELL AS ONE TIME FUNDING. FOR IT CONSULTING SERVICES COMPARED TO THE COMMISSION'S BUDGET PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE'S. AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND FINE IS THAT WE ARE MANAGE. WHEN CONSIDERING BOTH THE- MAY REVIEW FUND LEVEL AS WELL AS ONCE FUNDS. WERE APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR AND WE ARE STILL ADMINISTERING AND IN THE CASE OF THE TWO OF THOSE ONE TIME PROGRAMS ACTUALLY HAVE LIFESPANS. FOR NINE YEARS. THIS REPRESENTS THE 69% INCREASE IN THE FUNDS THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION IS MANAGING RELATIVE TO PRIOR TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. OVER THAT SAME TIME PERIOD THE COMMISSIONS RECEIVED ONLY THREE MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN IT- ANNUAL OPERATIONS FUNDING. REPRESENTING WHAT'S A 14% INCREASE OVER THAT FUNDING LEVEL PRIOR TO TWENTY ONE. AND OVER THAT TIME PERIOD THERE IS A 0% INCREASE IN OUR STAFF AT FORTY AND IN THE NEW POSITION- FOR THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. WORKFORCE THRILLED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE FOCUS ON COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY- BUT OF COURSE WOULD NOTE THAT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION MUST BE ADEQUATELY RESOURCE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTTHESE PROGRAMS. AND MEET THE NEEDS. OF OUR STUDENTS AND INSTITUTIONAL PARTNERS. THE COMMISSION'S ALSO. OTHER IN WORK STRING BY STE. CHANGES I FELT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL. I WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW UNIVERSAL APPROACH TO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID. THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT THIS FALL AND WE ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AND REQUESTS. FROM STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AS WELL AS HIGH SCHOOLS THAT WILL BE HELPING STUDENTS APPLY FOR AID STARTING THIS FALL. THIS CREATES DEMAND SPURRED THE STUDENT COMMISSIONS SUPPORT STAFF TRAINING EFFORTS DATA SHARING WITH K. TWELVE. OUTREACH MATERIALS AND RESOURCES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO MOVING FORWARD WITH STREAMLINING THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID THAT BACKS UP. TO MAKE THAT A SHORTER. PROCESS FOR STUDENTS WHICH IS A GREAT THING. HOWEVER THESE CHANGES REQUIRE THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION TO UPDATE OUR GRANT PROCESSING SYSTEMS AS WELL AS THE MAKE A LANDING CHANGES TO THE CALIFORNIA DREAM ACT APPLICATION. THAT WE ADMINISTER FOR IMMIGRANT AND UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS. GIVEN THESE TO MAKE UP PROJECTS AS WELL AS THE CONTINUED WORK ACROSS OUR OTHER EFFORTS- PARTICULARLY FOR I. T. DIVISION I HAVE TO POINT OUT THAT THE STUDENT COMMISSION REQUEST FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. ONE TIME. FOR IT CONSULTING SERVICES WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE MAY REVISION AND WE LOOK AT THAT AS A REALLY CRITICAL INVESTMENT- TOWARDS ENSURING THAT WE CAN. MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE PROJECTS- WITHOUT CREATING RISKS FROM DIVERTING IT STAFF FROM OTHER EFFORTS. IN CLOSING ALL NOTE THAT THESE NEED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT WORKLOAD AT THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION AND DO NOT CONSIDER OTHER POTENTIAL BUDGET FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION. AND WE- ASK THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR TO CAN. CAN YOU TO CONSIDER INVESTMENTS OF ORDER PROGRAMS WITH THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION CAPACITY IN MIND. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK FOR MYSELF. IN LIEU OF ASKING QUESTIONS I WOULD SAY THAT IN THIS TESTIMONY MAY REVISE JUST CRIED AIRED. AND WE REALLY AIRED THE SENATE PROPOSAL. AND WHEN WE HAD THE HEARING THAT WAS EARLIER IN THE YEAR WE REALLY STEP THROUGH. BOB WANTING TO KNOW ABOUT THE EQUITY FRAMEWORK IF THERE WERE CONVERSATIONS AFTER LAST YEAR'S- OF VETO OF THAT PARTICULAR ASSEMBLY BILL ARE ALSO ABOUT JUST THE DESIRE OF THE SENATE TO HAVE A BROADER COVERAGE AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENT AID AND I THINK SAID THAT WHAT THE COMMENTS- JUST OUTLINED- IS IT THIS IS A DISCUSSION THAT WILL GO ON INTERNET IN A MAJOR WAY OVER THE NEXT FOUR WEEKS SO I WOULD JUST CALL OUT THOSE. THAT HISTORY AND TWO OR THE TESTIMONY WE JUST HAD AND- WATSON IN THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL SO LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS HERE. I DO NOT HAVE FOR OUR QUESTIONS- OR COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ARE WHEN WE THANK EVERYONE WHO IS HERE FOR ISSUE FIVE WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ISSUE SIX WITH THE WHICH IS THE HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW. WE HAVE PROJECTS WILD FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SITUATION CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE DAVID SEWARD CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT. OF THE COLLEGE OF THE LAW AND WILL GO IN THAT ORDER AND BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. BACK THIS SHARE OF GOOD MORNING AGAIN JACK'S WALL. ARE IN FINANCE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS I EASY SINCE COLLEGE OF THE LAW. THE FIRST IS NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ONE HUNDRED MCALLISTER STREET PROJECT- ONE HUNDRED. STREET IS A MULTI USE BUILDING THAT'S WHAT STUDENT HOUSING AT AT AT AND ACADEMIC SPACE OF THE BUILDING CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE- IS IN NEED OF CRITICAL FRUIT MINCE. PARTICULARLY RELATING TO SEISMIC BREASTS- THESE RESOURCES WILL MAKE THE PROJECT FINANCIALLY VIABLE ALONG WITH OTHER FINANCING ORGANIZED BY HOUSTON'S- THE SECOND INVESTMENT IS EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE TIME GENERAL FUND. JUST FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING THE NAME OF THE INSTITUTION- ARE LETTER ALSO INCLUDES PROVISIONAL BUDGET LANGAT BILL BILL LANGUAGE THAT. RESTRICTS THE RELEASE OF THESE BONDS UNTIL THE PROCESS OF ANY CHANGES READ IT. THANK YOU AND I AM READY TO ANY AT THE PAN- PERCENT. THANK YOU MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. USING CONCENTRATORS DELEO- IF YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG ON THE L. A. YOU HAND OUT STILL WORD NOW ON PAGE FIVE IN THAT SHOWS THE- GENERAL FUND PROPOSALS FOR HASTINGS UNDER GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NAY REVISION FOR THE SECOND TIME I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON- WHAT IS THE LARGEST OF THE TO ME RVISION PROPOSALS WHICH IS THE MACALESTER TOWER RENOVATION PROJECT. THE PROJECT IS A CRITICAL SEISMIC RENOVATION PROJECT AND HAS MUCH BETTER BACK UP AND MANY OTHER MAY REVISION PROPOSALS. THAT'S I WANTED TO RAISE THREE ISSUES FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THE FIRST ON THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO FUND THIS PROJECT OUTSIDE OF. THE AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING GRANTS- PROGRAM SUBMIT THIS PROJECT. AS AN APPLICATION FOR THAT GRANT PROGRAM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN MARCH DETERMINE THAT THAT- PROJECT WAS INELIGIBLE FOR GRANT FUNDING. ANALYST BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT FINALIZED ON HOW IT WOULD LIKE TO ALLOCATE AS FOR THE STUDENT HOUSING GRANTS IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS HOW THIS PRODUCT PROJECT- COMPARES IN TERMS OF PRIORITY TO- TO THOSE OTHER APPLICATIONS LEVEL FUNDING IS ACCORDING TO THE- HASTINGS THE THREE MINIMUM LEVEL TO KEEP THE- OBJECT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE THE ANTICIPATED RENTS FOR THE BUILDING ARE HIGHER THAN THE AFFORDABILITY GOAL THAT SENT STATUTES SO COURTING TO HASTINGS ARE RENTS FOR THE NEW BUILDING WOULD BE. A REVERENCE FOR THE EXISTING BUILDING WOULD BE 30% OF 80% OF. AREA MEDIAN INCOME AND THE STATUTORY GOAL CURRENTLY IS 3% 250% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. AND THEN FINALLY WE JUST WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS A PRIMARILY A RESIDENTIAL FACILITY OF HISTORICALLY THE STATE HAS FOCUSED ON. ACADEMIC FACILITIES ACADEMIC FACILITIES ARE NOT SELF SUPPORTED FROM THE REVENUE AND TYPICALLY OF THE RENOVATION PROJECTS FOR A REQUIRE STATE FUNDING TO BECOME FEASIBLE. OF THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA ALONE HAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND SEISMIC ISSUES RELATED TO ITS ACADEMIC FACILITIES SO THIS IS STILL OUT. OF SERVICE ONGOING ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO. HASTINGS I THANK YOU CENTER LAYERED THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE MAY REVISE IS- A- MAJOR EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE COLLEGES STILL PLANS TO CREATE A MULTI INSTITUTIONAL ACADEMIC VILLAGE. AND WE SUPPORT- OF THE PROPOSALS THAT BEEN TENDERED E ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT PROCEEDING WITH THE SEISMIC STRENGTHENING OF THE ONE HUNDRED MCALLISTER BUILDING. AND THE OTHER STATES SUPPORT WILL MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO AGAIN OUR APPRECIATION ALL AROUND- FURTHER ON THE AGENDA IS A FUNDING FOR A REMAINING COST A WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY. WITH SOME WOMEN RAMOS WITH AB NINETEEN THIRTY SIX AND A CENTER- BURKE SB TWELVE EIGHTY EIGHT WHO- GOOD FOR THE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD. CREATE THAT NAME CHANGE- THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND WILL HELP US-PEOPLE'S BECAUSE WE WILL NOT COVER THE ENTIRE COST AND WE WILL WORK WITH THE- THE LEGISLATIVE SPONSORS OF THE BILLS TWO HUNDRED GERMAN WHETHER ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CAN BE PROVIDED. THE SECOND PUT YOUR COMMENTS. YES IT DOES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THEN THEN MOVING TO QUESTIONS LET ME JUST ASK ONE QUESTION A MAYBE A COMMENT FOLLOW UP. WITH MR STEWART.

STUDENTS FROM THE INDIAN PUBLIC SECTOR ENTIRE BAY AREA SOLD WITH THE ONE HUNDRED MCALLISTER- ALLOCATION WE ARE SQUARED AWAY WITH ALL OF OUR CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL. COULD BE DEVELOPED FOR ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC VISIBILITY FUNCTIONALITY BUT WE WOULD NOT EXPECT A STEADY CALIFORNIA TO BE A FINANCIAL SUPPORTER LAST LET PROJECT GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND I KNOW THAT. THERE HAD BEEN AN ISSUE WHERE. I DON'T KNOW THE POLITE WAY TO SAY IT OB YOU IN SOME QUARTERS OF UC ARE CONSIDERED A STEP CHILD AND OR WHAT HAVE HAD TROUBLE COMPETING FOR THE HOUSING MONEY THAT WAS UNDER THE UC SEGMENT OF HIGHER EDUCATION SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE I THINK IT RESOLVES THAT ISSUE AND ALLOWS TO THE UC MONEY TO TRULY GO TO OTHER PARTS OF THE UC.

LET THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT THE- PROGRAMS THAT CRUCIAL TO THEIR- ARE BALL JANET HAPPY TO ANSWER I. IT THERE ARE ANY. THANK YOU MUCH I'M JUST TO ASK WHY QUESTION OF THE- DEPARTMENT OF. IN THAT IS LAST- THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. IN THIS BUDGET ESTABLISHED GRANTS TO LOCAL LIBRARIES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AND IT WAS. OVERWHELMINGLY SUCCESSFUL AND IN FACT OVERSUBSCRIBED AND IT IS WHAT IT IS A ONE TIME FUNDING THING THE REASON WHY. IT WAS NOT PUT BACK IN THIS BUDGET FOR ONE TIME FUNDING TO MEET THAT NEED THAT WAS DEMONSTRATED LAST YEAR MISTER KERR- THE TWENTY TWENTY MY BUDGET A COMPUTATION WAS ONE TIME AND- THE CURRENTLY REVISION DOES PROVIDE- AN AUGMENTATION THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF RECREATION- SIMILAR TO HOW THE ITEM WAS AUGMENTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF IF THEY HAVE FURTHER ENQUIRIES- AND I CAN PASS ALONG TO MY COLLEAGUES OF THE DEPARTMENT- WHO OVERSEE THE DIP BUDGET OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WREXHAM. AT STATE PARKS AND RECREATION. WHAT THEN LET ME ASK A FOLLOW UP QUESTION BECAUSE THE SENATE BUDGET PROPOSAL PUTS GRANTS IN. AND YOU'RE REFERRING TO ONE AND PARKS AND REC WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT IS IN FOR PARKS AND REC AND WHAT THE SENATE IS PROPOSED TO JUST CONTINUE THE GRANTS PROGRAM THROUGH THE- LIBRARY. I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE SPECIFICS OF THE SENATE PROGRAM FOR SPECIFIC TO THE DEPARTMENT OF ROCK PARKS AND RECREATION. SO I'LL HAVE TO PASS ALONG YOUR INQUIRY. AS OF A MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL- FOR DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND REC THROUGH THE MEET ME REVISION FOR THE- BY THE ADMINISTRATION- THE- AUGMENTATION SHOULD FUNCTION SIMILARLY TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. IN TERMS OF FUNCTION OF MECHANICS WEBER HAND FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST I HAVE A SNEAKING SUSPICION. HE WANTS TO OFFER SOME CLARITY HERE MINISTRATIONS REFERRING TO A SEPARATE INITIATIVE THAT WAS FUNDED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. BUT THE DEPARTMENTS TOOK PART IN A PARKS AND RECREATION THAT FOCUSED ON. EXPANDING OUR PATRON ACCESS TO STATE PARKS AND OFFERING- FREE UP PARK PASSES AT LOCAL LIBRARIES AND- MARKETING THOSE MARKING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PATRONS- I THINK WHAT WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO SENATORS THE- MUCH LARGER AUGMENTATION PROVIDED LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AROUND A LIBRARY INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH REALLY HAD A VERY DIFFERENT FOCUS IT WAS FOCUSED ON- YOU KNOW- A LIBRARY FACILITY NEEDS AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE AND THEN THERE'S- AN ADDITIONAL ITEM IN THE SENATE DEMOCRAT BUDGET. AND THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE DISTINCT- ISSUES FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF. PARKS AND RECREATION. I APPRECIATE THAT CLARITY THANK YOU INTO IT BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL WAS I'D NEVER HEARD OF THE- HOUSE RELATED TO A DEPARTMENT OF PARKS AND RECREATION PROPOSAL SO. I THINK IT JUST THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS JUST AN OBSERVATION- I HAVE A VERY RETAIL DISTRICT WERE I JUST DO TONS AND TONS OF. OF EVENTS AND MEETINGS THROUGHOUT FOUR COUNTIES AND THIS IS ONE THAT PEOPLE WALKED UP OUT OF CROWDS IT JUST THANKED ME FOR. OF BUNCHES OF TIME SO I THINK. THE ASSISTANCE TO LIBRARIES IN THE IN THE BLOCK GRANTS WAS REALLY WELL RECEIVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT IS WHY GIVEN THE FACT IT WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED IT'S IN THE SENATE PROPOSAL AND SO. ARM I APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING THEY WOULD PASS ALONG OUR COMMENTS BUT I THINK IN NEGOTIATIONS WE WILL REALLY PRESS FOR THAT BECAUSE IT IS A ONE TIME. ITEM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HIGHLIGHTED AS A PREFERENCE. OF HIS FOR FUNDING EVEN THOUGH. WE HAVE LOTS OF I THANK ON THE TAPE FOR A LOT OF THINGS. ANY ELSE ALL OF ON THE LINE. THEN NINE LET ME THANK EVERYBODY FOR BEING HERE. AND THAT COMPLETES THE FIRST PART OF OUR AGENDA AND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SECOND PART. OF WHICH IS K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION. AND- AND WE HAVE A SIX ISSUES THAT GO THROUGH PROP NINETY EIGHT AND THE K. TO TWELVE BUDGET. ARE AND THE FIRST ONE- AND I SEE HE HAS JOINED US SO OF THE FIRST ONE IS A ONE PERSON PANEL OF- THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND WHO'S GOING TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STATE OF K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S INFORMATIONAL.

FOURTEEN SCHOOLS EVER- YEAH YEAH I KNOW YOU ALL KNOW. THAT WE ARE- CONFRONTING MANY CHALLENGES THAT HAVE COME FROM THE PANDEMIC- IN IN ADDRESSING- ISSUES OF EQUITY THAT EXISTED BEFORE AND WERE EXACERBATED DURING THE PANDEMIC WE THINK THAT THIS BUDGET IS THOUGHTFUL. ABOUT ITS APPROACH TO ADDRESSING MANY OF THOSE ISSUES ONE OF THEM BEING MENTAL HEALTH OF COURSE- AND WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT THIS BUDGET PROPOSES. TO EXPAND- RESIDENCY PROGRAMS FOR BOTH TEACHERS AND COUNSELORS. AND MAKES MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO WOULD BECOME A COUNSELOR- TO THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM WE ARE OBVIOUS YOU'RE TRACKING THIS CLOSELY. AS IT RELATES TO A BILL THAT WE ARE SPONSORING WITH SENATOR MCGUIRE THAT WOULD HELP US TO RECRUIT TEN THOUSAND. NEW MENTAL HEALTH CLINICIANS BY PROVIDING THEM SCHOLARSHIP SIMILAR TO WHAT IS IN THE GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANT PROGRAM- WE ALSO ARE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THE CONTINUED FOCUS ON LITERACY- THE AS YOU KNOW E'VE NAMED A TASK FORCE ON SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS. ON ACHIEVING THE BENCHMARK OF READING BY THIRD GRADE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND THIS BUDGET- BUILDS ON MANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THAT TASK FORCE AND WE'RE GRATEFUL. TO THE GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP IN PROMOTING IN PARTICULAR THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WILL SUPPORT THINGS LIKE LITERACY COACHES AND SPECIALISTS WE KNOW THAT- READING IS A GATEWAY SKILL. AND THE ABILITY TO READ MEANS MANY THINGS IT MEANS THAT YOU- YOU WHEN YOU LEARN TO READ YOU CAN READ TO LEARN ANYTHING AND. THAT WE KNOW THAT OUR COACHES AND SPECIAL STARBUCKS- A FULL OUR SCHOOLS SO HELP OUR STUDENTS TO. THEIR LITERACY. WE ARE TO THE FOCUS ON THIS- LITERACY EFFORTS ON SUPPORTING MULTI LINGUAL LEARNERS IN LIBRARIES ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU SCHOOL LIBRARY SIMILAR. TO THE LAST DISCUSSION ABOUT SUPPORTING LIBRARIES- BECAUSE WE MUST SUPPORT A BY LITERACY FOR STUDENTS- AS WELL. THIS BUDGET ON CONTINUES TO BUILD ON INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS. AND A PROPOSES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXPANDED. LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM WHICH MEANS THAT ESSENTIALLY OF THIS PROGRAM COULD BE FUNDED FULLY- FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE- THIS IS THE BUDGET ALSO ENVISIONS EXPANDING. THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM- LITERALLY TODAY THE STATE BOARD HAS TAKEN UP THE ISSUE OF APPROVAL OF THE VERY SCHOOLS THAT WILL RECEIVE GRANTS FROM. YES ALLOCATION OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS UP FOR PLANNING GRANTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- THOSE- GRANT SEPARATE IT OUT INTO THE PAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THOSE RESOURCES.

HELPING SCHOOL STABILIZER BUDGETS IN THE FACE OF THE CLONING ENROLLMENT- PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY FOR CALCULATING AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE- YOU KNOW A PROPOSAL FOR SOME THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD. HELP SCHOOLS TO MAINTAIN STABILITY IN ADDITION TO THAT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE BASE OF PERHAPS THE HIGHEST INCREASE THAT WE'VE SEEN SINCE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LCF AT ANY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT I WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF STAFFING- STUDENT LEARNING CHALLENGES PENSIONS AND OTHER ISSUES. THAT THEY MAY FACE THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL- AS WE POINTED OUT IN HEIGHT AND HIGHLIGHTS. I CERTAINLY COULD SPEAK TO OTHERS- AND WE'RE HAPPY TO DO SO THANK YOU SENATOR PER HAVE BEEN GIVING US TIME BEFORE- WE MIGHT TALK ABOUT PROGRAMS LIKE THE FREEDOM SCHOOL ADDITION TO THAT THAT SEEKS THREE. MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET TO EXPAND AND AFROCENTRIC EVIDENCE BASED LITERACY INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS OF ALL AGES I WOULD DEEPLY FOCUS ON HOW TO SUPPORT ON THE CHEAP IN A BLACK STUDENTS AND TO SUPPORT STUDENTS- WHO HAD BARRIERS- IN THE AWAY- AND TO HELP THEM- NOT LEAST OF WHICH- WOULD BE. LIKE A TO SEE SEVEN COULD CHANGE THE CHARACTER. RESULT OF LCS AFTER PROVIDED DESIGNATION STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO BE THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS AND OUR STATE AND SB NINE FIVE TWO WHICH WAS SPONSORING TO EXPAND DUAL LANGUAGE IMMERSION PROGRAMS- WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE FAMILY INTERVENTION PROGRAMS IN A B. TWO. FOUR SIX FIVE WHICH WE ARE ALSO SPONSORING TO SUPPORT LITERACY- I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT- THERE'S ONE ISSUE THAT I WOULD HOPE THAT. I CONTINUES TO GET DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS BUDGET IS FINALIZED AND THAT IS HOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM- BY SOME ACCOUNTS I CRIED ABSENTEEISM FOR KINDERGARTNERS IS UP BY ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. I'M DURING THE POST PANDEMIC AND NOW WE KNOW THAT MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO BE CONNECTED WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE OUR SCHOOLS PROVIDED NINE HUNDRED MILLION MEALS TO FAMILIES AND SO WE KNOW THAT THE NEED WAS GREAT WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS DISRUPTION. WE JOIN MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND LITERALLY CALLING FAMILIES WHO NEVER CHECKED IN END UP FOR OUR SCHOOLS AS THEY TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH ISSUES. OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM THAT MEANS OUTREACH WORKERS WHO CAN KNOCK ON DOORS AND CAN HELP IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE SPONSORED S. B. EIGHT THIRTY A BILL THAT PROVIDES THOSE KINDS OF RESOURCES. WE KNOW THAT IT'S A HEFTY PRICE TAG WE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN EVEN GREATER PRICE TAG WHEN STUDENTS ARE NOT IN SCHOOL LEARNING AND THEN OF COURSE THE FINANCIAL COSTS THAT OUR SCHOOLS EXPERIENCE WHEN CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. IS LEFT UNCHECKED SO. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO AYE ANSWERING QUESTIONS I'M JOINED BY NUMBER OF OUR STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN OUR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAMS- BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT YOU MAY HAVE ON THE ON THE LINES OF- K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION AS. IT RELATES TO THE- PROPOSED BY. FIRST OF ALL LET ME. YOU FOR YOUR OF READERS AND YOUR- TODAY IT IS REALLY HELPFUL US. AND I KNOW. THAT WE HAVE YOUR STAFF- STANDING BY. AND BEING AVAILABLE AS WE GO THROUGH THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS ON THE AGENDA AND- AS WE- DROVE DOWN ON EACH ONE INDIVIDUALLY THAT MIGHT PIZZA. THE MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR MOST OF THE QUESTIONS LET ME ASK OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SUPERINTENDENT IS HERE. I SEE NONE SO LET ME JUST THANK YOU AGAIN WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARTICIPATION IN YOUR LEADERSHIP AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THESE ISSUES AS WE MOVE THROUGH THEM AND- AND ARE. AND THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE BECAUSE YOU ARE THE FIRST PART OF THE SECOND- A PART OF THE AGENDA AND WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET TO IT AND AS SOMEBODY WHO HAS A COMPLICATED SCHEDULE I'M SURE THAT DISRUPTED YOUR SO JUST THANK YOU FOR BEARING WITH US AND BEING HERE. TODAY ALL YOU NEEDED- WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE ONGOING CONVERSATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AND THANK YOU OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CORRECT THANKS AGAIN. BEFORE WE MOVE TO ISSUE TOO I WAS GONNA MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS ON THE K. THROUGH TWELVE BUDGET JUST THE WAY I DID TO BE. BEFORE THE HIGHER READ BUDGET AND- LAST WEEK WE HEARD THE SENATE PLAN. ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TEN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND- TODAY WE'RE HEARINGS- THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE PROPOSAL THAT IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO PUT THEM. OUR IN RELIEF BECAUSE ON THE K. TO TWELVE SIDE THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK. FROM SCHOOL LEADERS AND STAFF WITH AN EYE TO THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT WAS JUST MENTIONED. OF OUR STUDENT POPULATION. AND WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S THOUGHTFUL APPROACH TO K. TO TWELVE EDUCATION THIS YEAR. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF KEY DIFFERENCES. THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT. THE CASE THROUGH TWELVE SENATE BUDGET PLAN PUTS AN EMPHASIS ON MAXIMISING DISCRETIONARY FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. A TO THAT END THE SENATE PROPOSAL WOULD ADD FIVE BILLION INTO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA THE L. C. F. F. IN THE BUDGET YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. WHICH WOULD INCREASE TO TEN BILLION BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE ON TOP OF A SIX POINT FIVE. 6% COLA IN OTHER WORDS PROVIDE A YEAR TO YEAR INCREASE OF ROUGHLY FOURTEEN PERCENT. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN MAY REVISION WOULD INCREASE CELL CFF FUNDING BY TWO POINT ONE BILLION. WITH THE CURRENT- AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ADD AN ON GOING TO BILLION ON TOP OF A SIX POINT 56% COLA. THAT COMES OUT TO ROUGHLY A 10% YEAR TO YEAR INCREASE. IN PREVIOUS ITEMS- IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THIS HEARING. WE NOTED THE CHALLENGES FROM THE PANDEMIC AND INFLATION. AND WHAT REALLY WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS TO MOVE AHEAD. R. N. N. IN NORMAL YEARS HAVING A SIX PERCENT- R. COLO WOULD BE CHEERED AND AS I SAID EARLIER WAS A SIMILAR THING IN HIGHER EDUCATION. I WILL JUST FIGHT TO KEEP IT THERE THIS YEAR THERE ARE JUST SO MANY ADDITIONAL PRESSURES THAT THAT WE REALLY HAVE TO DO MORE TO HELP THE SCHOOLS MOVE AHEAD. THE SENATE PROPOSES TO DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANTS THE TOTAL FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WHEREAS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE DISCRETIONARY BLOCK GRANT FOUR EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND SEVERAL OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS. I'D NOTE HERE THAT THE SENATE BLOCK GRANT ROLES MOST OF THE GOVERNOR'S GRANT PROGRAMS FUNDING INTO A CENTRALIZED GRANT PROPOSALS IN THE SENATE PROPOSAL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IMPORTANT PROGRAMS INCLUDING SCHOOL MALES EXPANDED LEARNING AND FACILITIES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT NOTABLY THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL ALSO INVESTED SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION WHICH IS REALLY HOME TO SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN A COLLABORATIVE AND THOUGHTFUL MANNER AS WE MOVE TOWARD A FINAL BUDGET AND THEN AT TODAY'S HEARING A WE WERE GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT I WAS SORT OF WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONTEXT AS WE HEADED INTO IT. SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND DISCRETIONARY SCHOOL FUNDING- WILL HAVE A CONCRETE THING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- KENNETH COUPON FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WITH MANY ITEMS TODAY WE WILL HAVE SOMEBODY AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS OF FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SO WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. HELLO CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M ON IN SAINT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'LL BE PRESENTING YOU WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE. AND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OR ELSE YES AFTER THAT TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE MAYOR VISION. PROF NINETY EIGHT CARE AND HE IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT NINETEEN POINT SIX BILLION ACROSS THE BUDGET WINDOW FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE COMPARED TO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. AND THIRTY FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION RELATIVE TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET ACT. ALL BUDGET YEAR STAR MAN AND THE TEST ONE WHICH MEANS THAT PROP NINETY EIGHT RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY 38% OF THE REVENUE CHANGES IN EACH OF THE THREE BUDGET YEARS. THE PROP NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE AS REVENGE TO REFLECT THE CONTINUED IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL T. K. FOR A ONE TIME VERSUS ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT POLICY ADJUSTMENTS AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. OF THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION THERE IS EIGHT POINT SEVEN BILLION AN ONGOING AND SEVEN POINT NINE BILLION ONE TIME EXPENDITURES PROPOSED. AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OR EIGHTY EIGHT IS PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY APPROXIMATELY 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. ADX CALCULATIONS INCLUDE UPDATED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT NEARLY AND ROLLING TEA CASE STUDENTS. AS WELL AS YOUR STUDENT ABSENCES RELATED TO COPE AT NINETEEN. IN REGARD TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT RAINY DAY FUND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROJECTED THAT A TOTAL OF NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN PAYMENTS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM STABILIZATION ACCOUNT- PISSA. WOULD BE NEEDED BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. ADJUSTMENTS IN CAPITAL GAINS REVENUES UP THE TWENTY TO TWENTY. VISION HOWEVER VICE THESE PAYMENTS DOWN FROM THAT NINE POINT SEVEN BILLION AT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO THE TOTAL A CURRENT TOTAL OF NINE POINT FIVE BILLION IN THAT. MISSION ALL NOW PRESENT A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE LCS. RESTFUL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AND THE BUDGET YEAR AT THE MAYOR VISION OF CFF DECREASED BY ABOUT ONE POINT THREE BILLION AS COMPARED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AT WHICH POINT WE HAD PROJECTED AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT ONE BILLION. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROJECTED EIGHTY EIGHT DECLINE ABOUT 5% A LARGE COLA INCREASE OF SIX POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR DISCRETIONARY ON GOING INCREASE TO THE BASE LCS FIVE WHICH COVER SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS AS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS SURPRISING PENSION OBLIGATION. OBLIGATIONS INCREASED COSTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES AND OTHER ONGOING LOCAL BUDGET CONCERNS. THIS INCREASE WILL FLOW THROUGH THE LCS FORMULA AND WILL INCREASE NOT ONLY THE BASE GRANT BUT CORRESPONDING SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS AS WELL. LANGUAGE FOR THIS ONGOING INVESTMENT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FORTHCOMING ARE AT. IN REGARD TO THAT DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROJECTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE THE CLEANING INVOLVEMENT PROTECTION IN THE BUDGET YEAR OF APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. WHICH REFLECTS THE REVISION OF THE THREE YEAR DECLINING ENROLLMENT PRODUCTION FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS BY MODIFYING THE COMPUTATION OF TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO EIGHTY EIGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE THREE YEAR AVERAGE. THIS PROTECTION AS PROVIDED FOR DISTRICTS AS LONG GOING TO TEST THAT FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE A ONE TIME DECLINING ENROLLMENT PROTECTION FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR FOR CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ONLY. AND THE AMOUNT OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. TO PROVIDE RELIEF FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WE PROVIDE AN ONGOING FACED INCREASED TO THEIR LCS UP AS WELL. THIS WILL BE IN THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND WITHOUT WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS RELATED TO PROP NINETY EIGHT- LCS US- PRESENTERS WILL DISCUSS MAJOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING PROPOSALS AND THE NEXT ISSUE WHICH IS A SHE THREE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU JEREMY CAN COMPOUND THE ANALYSTS OFFICE WILL GIVE YOU A FEW HIGHLIGHTS MATURED IN OUR SYSTEM WE PUBLISHED THIS MORNING. IBM CHRISTMAS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE NINETEEN POINT SIX BILLION OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD. IS A BIG STORY BUT MAYBE SURPRISINGLY IS NOT A VERY COMPLICATED ONE. I COMPARED TO JANUARY GENERAL FUND REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE UP NEARLY FIFTY SIX BILLION OVER THE THREE YEARS. AND UNDER THE FORMULA WE CALL TEST ONE SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVE ABOUT WE THINKTHE GENERAL FUND ESTIMATES DEMONSTRATION PROVIDED A REASONABLE AND IT LOOKED VERY CLOSE TO THE ESTIMATES THAT WE ARE FINALIZING. NOT PORTION OF THAT INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY. THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE. THEY HAVE BROUGHT DOWN THEIR ESTIMATES ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION COMPUTERS JANUARY. AND WE THINK WE THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE LOW I WOULD THINK PROPERTY TAX REVENUE IS LIKELY TO COME ANY CLOSER TO JANUARY. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT HAPPENS THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE WOULD INCREASE ON A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR BASIS. THAT'S A TURNING TO THE K. TWELVE SPENDING PACKAGE OVERALL. A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN BILLION IN NEW K. TWELVE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AUGMENTATIONS. THAT'S ON TOP OF NEARLY SIXTEEN BILLION IN JANUARY PROPOSALS. SO THE WHOLE PACKAGE BEFORE YOU WITH NEARLY THIRTY THREE BILLION. GOVERNOR ALLOCATES ABOUT NINETEEN BILLION OF THAT THE ONE TIME ACTIVITIES FOURTEEN MILLION FOR ON GOING. ANOTHER ISSUE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT LATELY AND IN SOME OTHER CONTEXT AS THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AND THIS MAY REVISION ONTAINS A TOTAL OF ABOUT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION IN K. TWELVE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING ON CAPITAL OUTLAY. WHICH IS EXEMPT FROM THE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT. AND THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE ONE WAY THE STATE CAN COMPLY WITH THE LIMIT JUST USE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES. WE SOMETIMES TALK ABOUT HOW THE STATE AS A PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET FOR SCHOOLS AND A NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUDGET FOR EVERYTHING ELSE. BUT THE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT DOES NOT HAVE THAT DISTINCTION. IN THE AMOUNT OF EXCLUDED SPENDING WITHIN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT CAN HAVE. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE WAY ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR THE REST OF THE STATE BUDGET. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GIVE YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR MOVING PIECES IN THIS- MAY REVISION. THE BIGGEST ONE IS THAT EIGHT BILLION ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR ANY LOCAL PURPOSE. HE DID BASED ON ATTENDANCE. HAS SOME INTENT LANGUAGE ABOUT HOW DISTRICTS. ARE THE STATE HOPES THE DISTRICT IS THE FUNDING- RANGING FROM A NUMBER OF PRIORITIES THE GOVERNOR LAYS OUT EVERY FROM I ENCOURAGING- PROJECT. MAINTAINING STAFFING LEVELS TOO COINCIDENTAL HEALTH. AS FAR AS THE ONGOING INCREASES MOST OF THE NEW FUNDING IS FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMPLICATED ASPECT OF THE KICKOFF PACKAGE BECAUSE IT HAS SO MANY MOVING PIECES. BUT I THINK THE WAY TO STAY ORIENTED IS THE FOCUS ON THE TOP LINE NUMBER IS. UNDER THE NAY REVISION THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR LCS PATH WOULD INCREASE ABOUT SEVEN POINT TWO BILLION MARKET BY DID THIS YEAR TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND THAT'S A TOTAL INCREASE ABOUT TWO POINT NINE BILLION COMPARED WITH THE JANUARY PROPOSAL. AND THAT'S THE RESULT OF. A FERMENTED JUST MEANS THE LOWER BASEMENT ATTENDANCE AT THE- GOVERNOR'S NEW ATTENDANCE- HOLD HARMLESS PROPOSAL. THE INCREASE IN THE STATUTORY COLA IN THE DISAMBIGUATE BAYSIDE MEDITATION ON TOP OF THAT AMOUNT. WHICH WE ESTIMATE. AT ROUGHLY THREE POINT FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION- WE ESTIMATE THAT PROPOSAL WOULD INCREASE. FUNDING WITH A 15% ON AVERAGE THE EXACT AMOUNT WOULD VARY A BIT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. SOME COUNTIES WILL RECEIVE INCREASES EVEN THOUGH THEIR EXISTING FUNDING ALREADY EXCEEDS THEIR TARGETS. UNDER THE FORMULA. THAT'S A TURNING TO OUR COMMENTS DECIDES ON- AJ IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUR HAND OUT. THIS IS THE LARGEST VISION PACKAGE SINCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. NEARLY THREE BILLION LARGER THAN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO MAY REVISION JUST THE PREVIOUS ALL TIME HIGH. BUT WE THINK ONE OF THE POSITIVE FEATURES IS THAT IT ALSO HAS. AND IF YOU AS AND HELP TO BUILD BUDGET RESILIENCY AND WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT GIVEN SOME OF THE ECONOMIC WARNING SIGNS THAT MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. AND HIGHER. BILLION IN I'M GOING TO K. TWELVE FUNDS THAT ARE ALLOCATED TO ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. THERE'S NOTHING. UNIQUE ABOUT THAT NUMBER. THE FINAL BUDGET COULD CERTAINLY GO HIGHER LOOK LITTLE HIGHER LOWER THAN THAT. BUT IT GIVES YOU A SIGNIFICANT QUESTION TO DEAL WITH THE POTENTIAL DOWNTURN. PROPOSITION NINETY RESERVE ALSO GROSSED NINE POINT FIVE BILLION. NEARLY 9% OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. NOT HUGE IN THAT CONTEXT BUT A VERY HELPFUL STARTING POINT FOR MANAGING VOLATILITY. ON THE LCF WE THINK MOST OF THE PROPOSALS ARE REASONABLE. PROVIDING AN AUGMENTATION BEYOND THE COLOR COULD ALLOW DISTRICTS TO SUSTAIN PROGRAMS EXPANSIONS MISTAKES OF SEVERAL COST PRESSURES. RANGING FROM HIGHER INFLATION HIGHER PENSION COSTS. WE ALSO THANK THE PROPOSED ATTENDANCE ADJUSTMENTS ARE REASONABLE BECAUSE THEY WOULD MITIGATE. THE TEMPORARY DROPS TO THE PANDEMIC WHILE STILL MAINTAINING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN STUDENTS AND FUNDING OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. WE DO HAVE SOME NOTABLE CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. THE MAY REVISION WOULD INCREASE FUNDING AT A FASTER PACE THAN FOR DISTRICTS WITHOUT A COMPELLING RATIONALE AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD MAKE THE FISA OF THE HISTORICAL FUNDING INEQUITIES THE STATE HAS ATTEMPTED TO EVEN OUT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WERECOMMEND YOU REJECT THAT PROPOSAL AND INSTEAD TAKE A LESS COSTLY APPROACH THAT'S CLOSER TO WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ON THE DISCRETIONARY GRANT TO THINK THIS IS AN IDEA SOME MERITS. WOULD HELP SCHOOLS ADDRESS THEIR HIGHEST ONE TIME PRIORITIES AND COMPLIMENTS OF OTHER PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET. AND YOUR PRIORITIES YOU CAN TAILOR THE PROPOSAL IN A COUPLE WAYS YOU COULD JUST THE INTENT LANGUAGE. FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE WANT TO ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO FOCUS MORE ON PANDEMIC RECOVERY OR DRESSING LOCAL DEBTS AND LIABILITIES. YOU CAN ADJUST THE AMOUNT. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE ALONG THE LINES OF THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN OR- OTHER THINGS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO FIND IN THIS- IN THE FINAL BUDGET. YOU CAN EVEN ADJUST THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE YOU WANT DISTRICTS TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS. YOU CAN DISPERSE FUNDS ACCORDING TO THAT TIME ON. WE HAVE A CONCERNS WITH A FEW SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THE NAY REVISION- DOES INVOLVE SOME OF THE TEACHER TRAINING INITIATIVES AS WELL AS THE RIGHT TO MUSIC SET ASIDE WITHIN THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMS. OKAY MORE ABOUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THE NEXT PANEL. BUT THE FUNDING FOR SOME OF THOSE PROPOSAL SEEMS PREMATURE GIVEN ALL THE FUNDING THAT'S ALREADY BEEN MADE AVAILABLE. EITHER IN THE JANUARY BUDGET OR IN PREVIOUS BUDGETS. AND LASTLY WE RECOMMEND YOU EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF PROVIDING MORE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR FACILITIES. AND WEIGHING THAT OPTION WE DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A FEW CONSIDERATIONS. ONE IS THAT THE STATE HAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE THAT'S- ONLY AVAILABLE ON A ONE TIME BASIS. I USING THAT FUNDING FOR FACILITIES TO PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT WOULD LAST FOR MANY YEARS. I WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME PROMISING OPTIONS RIGHT NOW. ONE COULD BE HELPING DISTRICTS OBTAIN THE DISABILITIES THEY NEED TO EXPANSION JUST NOT KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE KEY. IS ALREADY THERE KEY CHALLENGE FOR DISTRICTS AS THEY GEAR UP THE EXPANSION. ANOTHER OPTION COULD BE PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION IS A GOOD DOWN PAYMENT BUT WE THINK THE BACKLOG IS EVEN LARGER. AND I COULD EVEN ACCELERATE ONE OF THE KICKOFF PARTY IS LAID OUT. IN THE SENATE DEMOCRATS PLAN A FEW WEEKS AGO. OR THE STATE COULD THINK A ONE TO AND STUFF PAYMENT TO THE SCHOOL FOR. PROGRAM IN THAT COULD HELP ADDRESS OF THE BACK. IN DEMAND FOR. MAJOR CONSTRUCTION RENOVATION. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING COULD QUALIFIES EXCLUDABLE CAPITAL OUTLAY THE APPROPRIATIONS LIMITS. AND THAT WOULD EASE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL STATE BUDGET. AND LASTLY IT WOULDN'T HAVE TO COMPETE WITH ANY OF YOUR ONGOING PRIORITY IS WITH RE PURPOSING SOME OF THE ONE TIME FUNDS. FUNDS THAT ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR ONE TIME ACTIVITIES. US WITHOUT A COMPLETE MY COMMENTS AND MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SUBSEQUENT PANELSWILL COVER THROUGH THE OTHER PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL CHECK WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OVERVIEW AND ONE OF THEM IS IT THEY'RE BOTH A FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE FIRST ONE- HI ASK PREVIOUSLY IN ANOTHER SEGMENT BUT IT'S A QUESTION ABOUT DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND- STUDIES SHOW THEY WERE MORE IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC SO HOW DO THEY BENEFIT FROM THE EXTRA DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED HERE. HOW DO WE KNOW THAT EXTRA DOLLARS GO TO DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS ENORMOUS. AMBER ALEXANDER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS EARLIER NO THAT AREAS BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING YOUR OTHER COLLEAGUES THERE AND I THOUGHT SHE WASN'T MOVING. WE SHE WASN'T MOVING HER LIPS SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THE RIGHT PERSON UP ON THE SCREEN THANK. I DON'T THINK THE INTERRUPTION. MAYBE I NEED TO SPEAK LONGER WAIT TO GET BACK YEAH CANTOR ON RESERVE SO I SEE MYSELF I'M HOPING YOU'RE SEEING ME AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE QUESTION- YOU'LL NOTICE AS WE GO THROUGH AND THE INVESTMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT PANELS EACH PROGRAM REALLY- PLACES A DIFFERENT DIFFERENT EMPHASIS ON- YOU KNOW. PARTICULAR STUDENT GROUPS I MEAN I'M OBVIOUSLY THAT BOTH LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AUGMENTATION AS WELL AS THAT AND YOU KNOW THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. DOES GO OUT FOR ALL STUDENTS- HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT AS THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT NO THERE ARE THERE IS OBVIOUSLY THE LOCAL DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND VOEPEL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS THAT DOES. LOOK TO. MAKE SURE THAT THE STUDENTS THAT ARE AND THEY END UP LOOKING AT STUDENT GROUPS THAT ARE GENERATING SOME OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION BASED GRANT FUNDING DOLLARS. ARE BEING SERVED ADAM YOU KNOW PROPORTIONALLY TO THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT THEY'RE GENERATING. YOU'LL ALSO SEE AND SOME OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS AROUND AND COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND SOME OF THE LITERACY COACH AND PROPOSALS AS WELL IN TRAILER BILL. THAT THERE ARE PRIORITIES CALLED OUT IN THE VARIOUS PIECES OF TRAILER BILL TO BETTER TARGET- BUT DOLLARS BETTER AT BEING APPROPRIATED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS TO THOSE. STUDENT GROUPS THAT ARE I'M MORE HANEY. MARKET FOR YOU AND MORE WANT TO CAN. THAT DOES. IN THE- IN THE BUDGET DELIVERY. AND OTHER. FOR FINDING. IS TO. T. OFF OF A COMMENT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S MADE WHICH IS REALLY. A WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS- HOW DID. THE ADMINISTRATION DETERMINED THAT TWO POINT ONE BILLION WAS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL FOR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. INCREASE WHETHER THAN A LARGER INVESTMENT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE SENATE BUDGET PLAN BUT OUR- WHY DID DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SERVER LAND ON TWO POINT ONE BILLION AND NOT GO HIGHER GIVEN THE AVAILABLE ON GOING FUNDS. WE AGREED WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I WILL SAY THE SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CALCULATIONS FOR WHEN OUR COLLEAGUE CHRIS FERGUSON IS ABLE TO JOIN- ON HOW AND HOW WE REACH THAT SPECIFIC AMOUNT ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE TWO POINT ONE BILLION IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT HOLD HARMLESS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. NO I THINK IT IS THIS IS THE GENERAL AUGMENTATION TO THE- ODD TO THE- NINETY EIGHT LCF LEVEL YES IT STILL LIVES ON THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WE ALWAYS HAVE TO PRIORITIZE- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT NEEDS AND DIFFERENT AREAS AND AT AT THE END OF THE DAY- WE KNOW THIS WAS THE AMOUNT WE KIND OF SETTLED ON- WE WEIGHED. YOU KNOW INCREASING THE BASIC THE BASE GRANT WHICH ALSO INCREASED THE THAT SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS BECAUSE IT FLOWS THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORMULA- WE WAIT INCREASING THAT BY A HIGHER PERCENT- I THINK THAT MY COLLEAGUE CAN FROM THE ALLEY- MENTIONED IT WAS APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT TWO THREE POINT 3% INCREASE SO THAT WAS THAT THE NUMBER WE HAD KIND OF- REACHED AFTER BALANCING OTHER PRIORITIES- BUT I CAN GET YOU MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON THAT- I THINK THE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION COME UP IN THE NEGOTIATIONS OVER THE BUDGET WE JUST. FELT FROM THE SENATE LEVEL THE HIGHER AMOUNT WAS WAS JUSTIFIED AND I THOUGHT UNDERSTANDING HOW YOU LANDED A LOWER AMOUNT GIVEN ALL THE AVAILABLE FUNDS WAS WAS THE QUESTION SO WHAT WILL DISCONTINUE THAT IN THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE BUDGET THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE YES MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS HERE ON THE SIDE AMAZINGLY SO- FLIGHTS I THANK EVERYBODY ON THIS ITEM AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE AT ALL JUST ACKNOWLEDGE AT ALL THESE ARE RELATED AND- ISSUE THREE IS THE MAJOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT SPENDING PROPOSALS ARE WE HAVE ALEX SHOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'VE TWO PEOPLE LISTED FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE'LL LET THEM DECIDE. ONE OR BOTH MICHAEL FERRIS INSERT. THEN WE HAVE SOMEBODY AVAILABLE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT CAISTOR QUESTIONS WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- ALLEN CHAU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I'LL PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE MAJOR. NINETY PROPOSALS FROM THE MAY REVISION AND THEN I HAVE SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS- SO BEGINNING WITH COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THE MARY VISION INCLUDES ONE POINT FIVE BILLION ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS FRANCE- TO EVERY ELIGIBLE. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY THAT WISHES TO APPLY- THIS FUNDING WOULD BE AN ADDITION TO THE INITIAL THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION PROP NINETY GENERAL FUND- FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS PROGRAM. THE DEPARTMENT HAS REVIEWED APPLICATIONS FOR THEIR FIRST ROUND OF PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND PLANS TO AWARD PROXIMALLY TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY GRAMS AND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS- ADDITIONALLY THE DEPARTMENT EXPECTS INCREASED INTEREST IN APPLICATIONS FOR THE SECOND ROUND OF PLANNING GRANTS AS WELL AS FOR THIS THREE FUTURE ROUNDS. OF IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE HAVE PROPOSED AN ADDITIONAL THREE POINT FOUR BILLION ONGOING- TOP. OF THE ONE BILLION. DOLLAR INVESTMENT- INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THAT HD NAY REVISION WE INCREASED THAT BY AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED THREE MILLION FOR A NEW ONGOING TOTAL OF FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION. WE ALSO MODIFIED THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REFLECT ONCE LAST YEAR FUNDING FOR- OF- TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT FOR ALL ELEAZAR. REGARDLESS OF THEIR LOCATED. PEOPLE PERCENTAGE. AB MOVIE ON TO NUTRITION THE MAYBE FOR BOOT AND ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE AND ENHANCE- MEAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES UNDER THE STATE MEAL PROGRAM. AT THIS FUNDING WILL PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIXTY THREE CENTS REIMBURSEMENT PER MEAL AND WOULD ENSURE THAT SCHOOL FOOD AUTHORITIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE CURRENT LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT. WHEN FEDERAL WAIVERS EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT YEAR- STATE SO THE SIGNAL PROGRAM WOULD REIMBURSE REMAIN COST BETWEEN THE COMBINED FEDERAL AND STATE RATE NOT TO EXCEED ABOUT FOUR DOLLARS AND SIXTY TWO CENTS- AND ESSENTIAL SCHOOL REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE INCREASED ANY EXCESS FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED- REALLOCATED TO THE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND TRAINING GRANT PROGRAM SO WITH- UPDATED COLA. AND ROADS ESTIMATES- THIS PROVIDE A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND NINE MILLION FOR THE BASED PROGRAM- AND THEN THE MAYBE VISION ALSO MAINTAINS. THE FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS THESE TOGETHER WITH THE MAY REVISED PROPOSAL. WOULD RESULT IN A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. ONGOING FOR SCHOOL NUTRITION- AND THEN SIGN FOR THE COMMUNITY. INITIATIVE THE MAYOR REVISION INCLUDE AN INCREASE OF ONE. MILLION ONE TIME. NINETY EIGHT. EXPANSION OF THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE FOR CDI- AS YOU MAY RECALL THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET ACT PROVIDED THIRTEEN POINT THREE MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR THE CBI- THE CI WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR ITS COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO HAVE AUTHENTIC CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER AND BUILD TRUST WITH THE FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS THROUGH THE CONVENIENCE OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS FOCUS ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT- RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WORK ESPECIALLY IN AND LATER THE PANDEMIC THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THE EXPANSION- THAT WOULD EXPAND THE REACH OF THE PROGRAM TO HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL AT LEAST THROUGH THE CREATION OF PROFESSIONAL LEARNING RESOURCES- THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ELEAZAR FREE OF CHARGE- IN THIS NEW VESSEL WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THE CREATION. OF A COMMON DEFINITION AND METRICS FOR EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITY INSURANCE AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR MANY MORE AT LEAST YOU PARTICIPATE IN PROFESSIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND- WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE. TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING MISTER TURNER MEMBERS MICHAEL PHELPS WITH ILLEGAL. I'LL BE COVERING OUR OFFICES COMMENTS ON THREE OUT OF THE FOR PROPOSALS IN THIS ISSUE I DON'T. THAN I'LL TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES ARE CORTES WILL COVER CHANDA TRISTIAN. REGRETTING THE PROPOSED AUGMENTATION FOR THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANT PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE FUNDING INCREASE AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD COVER THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES OF THE PLAN FOR THE PROGRAM. ALL THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE THE FUNDING AMOUNT BASED ON ITS PRIORITIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS. REGARDING THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE UNIFORMS WHEN THE RATE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. ENGLISH ARAMBULA COME STUDENT IN GRADES K. THROUGH SIX. BUT REJECT THE TWO TIER PROGRAMMATIC REQUIREMENTS INWHICH SOME SCHOOLS WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER THE PROGRAM TO ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS. AND OTHER STUDENTS WILL ONLY BE REQUIRED TO OFFER THEIR- TO OFFER THE PROGRAM TEAM MISTER AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WE RECOMMEND INSTEAD OF SETTING A UNIFORM EXPECTATION THAT SCHOOLS MOST OF ALL INTERESTED. ENGLISH LEARNER AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS IN GRADES K. THROUGH SIX. THIS WOULD CREATE A UNIFORM FUNDING AND PROGRAMMATIC EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL SCHOOLS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE ONE BILLION IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ALL SET ASIDE FOR ARTS MUSIC. DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL OF. THE PROGRAM. THE TENSION UNSPENT FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE YEARS THAT COULD BE USED FOR ONE TIME EXPENSES. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO ADOPT THE ONE TIME FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM. WE RECOMMEND REMOVING THE RESTRICTION OF 75% OF THE FUNDS TO SPECIFICALLY WAS FOR ARTS PROGRAMS. REGARDING THE FUNDING FOR THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVES WE THINK THAT PROVIDING FUNDING FOR THAT. FOR THIS PURPOSE IS REASONABLE. BUT WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL BE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF THE INITIATIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD REDUCE FUNDING AMOUNT BASED ON HIS PRIORITIES. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS. WE RECOMMEND BOTH. THIS SOME PROGRAM HAS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT THAT WOULD BE DUE IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN WE RECOMMEND THAT ON THIS RECORDING FARMING MOVED UP TO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY SIX FLIP THE LEGISLATURE HAS TIME TO REVIEW THE FINDINGS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE- FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM- THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS NOW WILL TURN THINGS OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES ARTWORK SAYS WE CAN'T OPEN FIRE COMPANY. OF SCHOOL NUTRITION THANK YOU. GOOD FAIR CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO WE HAVE A COMMON WITH REGARD TO THE NUTRITION PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE RATE- FOR SCHOOL MEALS AND WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT INCREASES IN REIMBURSEMENT RATES- ARE REASONABLE GIVEN COST PRESSURES NUTRITION PROGRAMS BASED. ON HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE A LOWER AUGMENTATION DEPENDING ON ITS PRIORITIES AND THEN WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING ON THE REALLOCATION OF ONIONS FUNDS OF FUNDING FOR THE KITCHEN INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S DECISIONS ABOUT. UNSPENT FUNDS CAN BE MADE IN THE NEXT BUDGET CYCLE AND THAT CONCLUDES MY WORK THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- HELLO YES MY COLLEAGUES FIRST ARE THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. NO FROM SENATOR MAN CENTER OF TROUBLE. I THINK JUST FURTHER CLARIFICATION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS TO THE- WHAT IS THE OVER A PROPOSED RATE FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR SCHOOL MEALS THE STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE AND THE FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE. AT THANK YOU EL SHOW DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO THE OVERALL STATE REIMBURSEMENT RATE WOULD COME OUT TO ABOUT EIGHTY NINE CENTS- AS SORT OF LIKE THE STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE STATE MEAL PROGRAM- THE FEDERAL. THAT REIMBURSEMENT RATES I MEAN THAT DEPENDS ON THE PROGRAM- I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC NUMBERS IN FRONT RIGHT NOW I BELIEVE YOU KNOW FOR NATIONAL SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM THE CURRENT YEAR IT'S ABOUT THREE. I'M SEVENTY THREE- FOR A FREE LUNCH- SO UNIVERSAL MEALS WOOD- YOU KNOW FIND AT THE COMBINE THOSE TWO COMBINED. REYES TOGETHER. SECONDLY TO QUESTION. THEN OUR WEBMASTER ONE QUESTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HERE- B. N. AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH- RECOMMENDATION FOR- FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANTS BECAUSE THE- LEGISLATURE APPROVED LAST YEAR THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS PROGRAM THEN THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION DID SEVEN HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST ROUND OF PLANNING ADMINISTRATION GRANTS JUST TWO WEEKS AGO HOW DID MINISTRATIONS AND DETERMINED ANOTHER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION WHICH NEED. THE MORNING CALL FINISHER TANGO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION NUMBER IS BASED OFF OF THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM THE FIRST ROUND OF PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. AND ADDS HE EXPECTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION EXPECT THERE TO BE AN INCREASED INTEREST APPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE ROUNDS OF PLANNING IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND ESSENTIALLY WE USE THAT NUMBER- AN END USER EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY'LL BE ADDITIONAL TO ADDITIONAL RATHER PARAGRAPHS OF THE RISE OF PUBLICATION GRANTS. THE NEW AND USING THOSE ASSUMPTIONS TO GET TO THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION WE ALSO WANTED TO PROVIDE THIS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS GRANTS EVERY ELIGIBLE THAT WISHES TO APPLY. BUT DOES THAT MEAN THAT THUS FAR THERE HAVE NOT BEEN THREE MILLION DOLLARS A THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANTS THE EXPECTATION IS THEY'LL BE GRANTED TO FULFILL WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN APPROPRIATED AND THREE BILLION AND THAT THERE'S A NEED OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION TO IT HASN'T BEEN REALIZED YET. IS THAT THE GIST OF IT. YES THAT'S CORRECT OKAY HOW DO NOTE THAT FOR BUT DISCUSS ALTHOUGH. HE ALSO NOTED EARLIER IN THE HEARING. THE HIGHER EDUCATION HOUSING IS OVER SUBSCRIBED BUT THERE WAS NO RECOMMENDATION MADE AND THE LIBRARY GRANTS WERE OVERSUBSCRIBED AND THERE WAS NO RECOMMENDATION MADE SO. BUT HERE IT'S NOT QUITE OVERSUBSCRIBED THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION FOR MORE SO I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT COMPARISON FOR OUR DISCUSSIONS AS WE MOVE AHEAD. ANYTHING ELSE ON ISSUE THREE OF FROM MY COLLEAGUES. THEN LET'S MOVE TO ISSUE FOR SCHOOL FACILITIES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LET ME THANK EVERYBODY THAT WAS THERE FOR THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON ISSUE FOUR. OF WE HAVE JENNIFER KAKU FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND AMY LEE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE- GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER CROCKETT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN PROPOSES SHIFTING TO EUROPE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE ONE BILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PREVIEWS PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED IN 232-422-1224 A TOTAL. OF TWO BILLION ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL SIGNED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO TO SUPPORT NEW CONSTRUCTION AND MODERNIZATION PROJECTS THROUGH THE SCHOOL FCILITY PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO APPROPRIATE ONE POINT TWO BILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TO SUPPORTIT IN SUPPORT OF NEW CONSTRUCTION MODERNIZATION PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES AN APPROPRIATION OF ONE POINT SEVEN. ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST. GOOD MORNING SENATORS ANYWAY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I WILL KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS THE TO ME REVISION PROPOSALS ON SCHOOL FACILITIES AND THEN OFFER SOME ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE FIRST UNINTENTIONAL FUNDING PROPOSED FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM IT'S FUNDING WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO CONTINUE FUNDING SCHOOL FACILITIES PROJECTS AFTER THE STATE LAST SCHOOL BOND PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE. IT'S FORTY EXHAUSTED AND BUDGET YEAR AS MENTIONED EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE AND ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER FUNDING IN THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM UDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AS THIS MAY BE SOME PRESSURE ON THE OVERALL STATE BUDGET AND- EVERAL OTHER BACK BENEFITS AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED PROPOSED FIND WHAT SCHOOL MAINTENANCE BACKLOG THAT LIKELY A KEY. DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHEN THE STATE PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY OVER THE AMOUNT SCHOOLS WERE REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE FOR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE. HERE THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING MORE FUNDING AS A MAINTENANCE BACKLOG LIKE RISA PASSES THE PROPOSED AMOUNT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER ALLOCATING FUNDING BASED ON TAXABLE PROPERTY VALUE RATHER THAN THE PROPOSED A DUPLICATED PEOPLE COUNT. WE CAN TALK MORE PROPERTY VALUE LIKELY STRONGLY CORRELATES WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS AS DISTRICTS WITH LOWER TAXABLE PROPERTY VALUES ARE TYPICALLY MORE CONSTRAINED IN OUR ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL FINE REVENUE. FOR SCHOOL FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU. OUR THANK YOU IN LET ME UP WITH A QUOTE OF- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND- FOR THOSE OF YOU LIKE ME WHO ARE TRYING TO FOLLOW AT HOME. OF THE WE HAD- A SCHOOL BOND THAT IN ESSENCE IS- ESSENTIALLY THE FUNDING IS RUNNING OUT. AND THREW APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATURE WHERE PATCHING TOGETHER CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR HOPE OF SOME OF US THAT AT SOME POINT THERE WOULD BE A BOND FOR- FOR FACILITIES AND IN MANY WAYS THESE APPROPRIATIONS ARE PATCH TO THE FUTURE AND SO. IF WE APPROVED WHAT THE- THE MAY REVISION IS HOW FAR AHEAD WOULD THAT TAKE US IN FACILITIES FUNDING AGAINST. OF THE NEED THAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED THROUGH APPLICATIONS. I KNOW THAT'S A CONVOLUTED QUESTION BUT I'M TRYING TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE ABOUT A POTENTIAL BOND AND WHAT MONEY WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND TELLS SUCH A POTENTIAL BOND MIGHT BE REAL HONEST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION SENATOR CLEARED I THINK THAT IS I'M A BIT OF A CHALLENGING QUESTION TO ANSWER AT THIS TIME I THINK WE CAN SAY THAT THAT FUNDING THAT WAS SUPPOSED IN BEGIN YOUR BUDGET THAT WE'RE NOW. SHIFTS TO AT TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SPENDING THAT WILL COVER MOST OF THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE QUEUE FOR THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM. WE'RE NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHAT THE RATE OF A FUNDING REQUEST WILL BE SORT OF AFTER THAT POINT BUT MOST LIKELY THE FUNDING THAT THAT ADMINISTRATION HAS SATISFIED. WERE BOTH TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR WELL WELL I GO UP A RATHER LONG WAY I DON'T KNOW A FINANCE WANTS TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL PROJECTIONS ON AND HOW FOR THE PROPOSED FUNDING KIND OF. A LET ME ASK THE FINANCE PERSON WAS PROBABLY REALLY HAPPY THAT. THAT SHE WASN'T CALLED ON ORIGINALLY. IF SHE WISHES TO COMMENT ON THIS- THE YOU CHAIR- YEAH ACCORDING TO THE- OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CAN. OUR BEST ESTIMATES RIGHT NOW ARE THAT THE FUNDING SHOULD LAST US THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AFTER THAT THAT OFFERS US SOME PERSPECTIVE ON THE POTENTIAL YEARS THAT WE MIGHT. OUR GO TO THE VOTERS WITH THE BOND BUT FROM. WHAT WHAT THAT WILL JUST BE ANOTHER ITEM FOR DISCUSSION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GROUND TRUTH THOSE NUMBERS AS WE HEAD INTO THE FINALIZATION OF THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON ISSUE FOR. SENATOR MADE. I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT- THE STATE SENATE'S VOTE BUDGET PLAN INCLUDES- ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR I. T. K. FACILITIES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE BECAUSE- I'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF SCHOOLS IN DELHI AS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS ARE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FACILITIES IN PLACE AND IT LACKED THE FUNDING. TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S AMBITIOUS UNIVERSAL T. K. PROGRAMS I THINK IF WE WANT OUR SCHOOLS TO. DO THIS WEEK WE HAVE TO PROVIDE FUNDING I THINK THIS IS APPROPRIATE SO I WOULD URGE THAT THIS- PARTICULAR FUNDING INVESTMENT- BE KEPT IN. WHAT ARE THE FINAL OUTCOMES ARE. FROM THE END LET ME JUST PIGGY BACK ON BECAUSE ON THE THANK THE SENATOR FOR HIS COMMENTS TONIGHT REALLY AGREE. AND IN OUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS WE TALKED ABOUT. BOTH FACILITIES AND STAFF ARE BEING ISSUES FOR. THIRTY K. PRE K. AND THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL ALSO DOES SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK IS DONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON THAT IS THAT. A BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARE NOT GIVEN MONEY FOR THE T. K. PRE K. AND- ALL THE REST OF THE SCHOOLS ARE ON THE FUNDING FORMULA GET THEM. AND THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL BEFORE THE GRANTS FOR PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION WOULD APPLY TO TWO BASIC AID SCHOOLS AS WELL AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE. AND I THINK THAT'S TRUE WITH THE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS AT THE SENATE OF RECOMMENDED IN GENERAL. AND IT IS JUST I GET LOTS OF QUESTIONS FROM THAT AND I WOULD JUST ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THERE ARE VARYING DEGREES OF BASIC AID SCHOOLS. OF SOME ARE VERY SMALL. JUST OVER THE TRIGGER AB ONE PARTICULAR LARGE PROPERTY TAX BEARING PROPERTY IN THEIR DISTRICT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND THEN OTHERS. ARE INCREDIBLY WEALTHY AND SUBSTANTIALLY OVER AND BUT NEITHER ARE GIVEN ANY MONEY THAT TO DEAL WITH T. CARE PRE K. IN THE FACILITIES RELATED TO IT SO. I WOULD JUST PIGGY BACK THAT THAT COMMON ON A SENATOR MANUAL CAN I WOULD ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITH YOURS AS WELL I FORGOT TO MAKE THAT. EXCELLENT POINT ABOUT. THE NEED FOR BASIC AID DISTRICTS TO ALSO RECEIVED FUNDING A FOREIGN ASK THEM TO TAKE ON THIS ADDITIONAL BURDEN- EVEN BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS DO NEED THAT FUNDING SO I THINK I WOULD AT. SUPPORT CENTER LATEST PUSH HERE THANK YOU AND WE'RE TAKING THINGS UP FOR THE DISCUSSIONS TO COME. ANY FURTHER COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR. THEN SINGING LET ME THANK THE PANELISTS AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE COMMISSION ON. TEACHER CREDENTIALING EDUCATED WORK FORCE FOR VOTE PROPOSALS.

HI AND INCLUDING USED TO OUR IN A AND FOR. WORKER FROM- COUNTLESS. AMERICAN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE I. SEVERAL MAY TO FOR. AND BETTER. THE ADMINISTRATION PROGRAMS I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY THAT THE- TIME TO COME. ALL ON THE LINE FOR. RIGHT YOU. AND THEN MORE TO THE LEGISLATIVE IN OF. THANK YOU ANYWAY WITH L. A. M. ON THE TEACHER PROPOSAL REQUIRE COMMANDER APPROVE REDUCE AMOUNTS SPECIFIC HOW OF AMOUNT FOR AND THE TEACHER RESIDENT TECHNIQUE ASSIST CENTER AND SEPARATELY THE READER AND LET AUTHORIZATION FRANCE I'M A TECHNICAL CENTER REDUCE AMOUNT WILL AND- FOR. I JUST OVER I WHICH WILL COULD CONSIDER FUNDING AND FOR THE AND GRANTS A REDUCED AMOUNT REFLECTING MORE REASONABLE GROWTH TARGET WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE REMAINING TEACHER PROPOSALS UNDER THIS ISSUE. STARTING FIRST WITH A PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL TEACHER RESIDENCY GRANT WE THINK SUCH A SIGNIFICANT ONE TIME AUGMENTATION IS PREMATURE GIVEN THAT AROUND TWO HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION OF THE FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE LAST BUDGET HAS INCLUDING NEW SCHOOL COUNCIL RESIDENCY PROGRAMS COULD HAVE LIMITED BENEFITS AS SCHOOL COUNSELING IS NOT AN AREA OF CHRONIC SHORTAGE TYPICALLY FOR THE STATE AND THE INTEREST AMONG SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP THESE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. REMAINS UNCLEAR LIKEWISE ON THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSALS RELATED TO MATH SCIENCE AND EDUCATOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT GRANTS THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AVAILABLE OVER FIVE YEARS FOR A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATOR. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES. CONFRONTING IS STILL OF A FROM LAST YEAR'S FINDING AND SCHOOL CAN PROBABLY USE THESE MUSIC THIS FIND. OR EXPRESSION BASED ON LOCAL. AND TAILORED TO LOCAL. AS SUCH WE THINK STATE OF NEED TO FIND. PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AT THIS TIME. MOVING ON WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THE PROPOSED EIGHTY MILLION ON GOING FOR THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SCHOOL SUMMER ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES STATEWIDE HAVE ON EQUAL ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM AS ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN OUT OF ABOUT ONE THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES. PARTICIPATE IN SAID WE THINK LOCALLY NEGOTIATED PAY RAISES FOR CLASSIFIED STAFF THROUGH THE PROPOSED ALTHEA HAVE FACED INCREASED. WOULD BE MORE EQUITABLE AND WIDESPREAD. LASTLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES MODIFYING GOLDEN STATE TEACHER GRANTS THE ON THE HIGH NEED FIELDS. FOR EXAMPLE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND STEM FIELDS- INSTEAD INCLUDE ALL TEACHER CANDIDATES AND PEOPLE ARE PERSONAL SERVICE CREDENTIALS INCLUDING SOCIAL WORKERS COUNSELORS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS. WE RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE REJECTS THESE CHANGES AND NOT ALL PROFESSIONS OR SUBJECT AREAS THAT WOULD BE NEWLY ELIGIBLE ARE IMPACTED BY CHRONIC SHORTAGES. FURTHER EXPANDING ELIGIBILITY COULD REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE GRANTS TO ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS PURSUE YOU THE HIGH NEED TEACHING FIELDS WHICH SCHOOL TYPICALLY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY STOPPING AND- THAT INCLUDES MY COMMENTS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS OF APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY THAT COMPLETE OUR PAN AND KNOW WE PEOPLE. A ANSWER COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF WE NEED THEM AND WE'RE RUNNING REALLY LOW ON TIME AND SO. RATHER THAN ASK A QUESTION- JUST MAKE THE STATEMENT THAT I NOTED TO THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT INCLUDED. ARE IN PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SUBJECTS OTHER SUBJECTS LIKE SOCIAL SCIENCES IN LANGUAGE ARTS AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THIS GOING TO THE- TO THE CLOSE. WILL JUST- IT- ASK FOR A RESPONSE ON THAT. ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES NON FROM CENTER CHAU BOGGED DOWN FROM SENATOR MAN THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING THERE ON. UP ON THE SIDE WILL MOVE TOWARD LAST ISSUE IN- CAPABLE TWELFTH PARK. WHICH IS EARLY EDUCATION. AND WE HAVE JODI LIEBERMAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SARAH CORTEZ FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. OFFICE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING CHIU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JERRY LIEBER WITH THE OF FINE. ALL RIGHT OVER OF THE NOTABLE- EARLY EDUCATION RELATED INVESTMENTS INCLUDING THE MAY REVISE FOR BOTH TRANSITIONAL INDERGARTEN AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM I'LL BE STARTING WITH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN EXPANSION PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE REDUCE THE DOLLAR PREPARATION BY APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION AT. THIS WOULD FAVORITE AT NAY REVISION WHICH IS ARE A REFLECTION OF THE REVISED EIGHTY EIGHT ESTIMATES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE YEAR. AND TRAILER BILL WE ALSO CLARIFY AUDIT PENALTIES RELATED TO CLASS SIZE RATIOS AND TEACHER EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS IN TWO K. CLASSROOMS REQUIRED BY LOCAL SIGN OPTIONS FOR TKA AND FOR THE PURPOSES OF FUNDING ADDITIONAL CERTIFIED OR CLASSIFIED STAFF PERSON TO EVERY CLASSROOM YOU SPECIFY- THAT WOULD BE BASED ON P. TWO EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR. WE WANT TO RESULT FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THE MAY REVISION INCLUDES FAMILY FEE WAIVERS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OF THE TEN POINT SEVEN MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND TEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENRAL FUND TO PROVIDE THESE WAIVERS FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. IN ADDITION THE MAYOR REVISION PROPOSES INVESTING ONE POINT ONE MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR TO SUPPORT FAMILY FEE WAIVERS FOR THIS- THIS CURRENT. YEAR ALSO INCLUDE AS AN EXTRA. OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL FUN HOLD WILL PROVIDE IT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM OF FUNDING BASED OFF OF THE MAXIMUM REIMBURSABLE AMOUNT. BASED A PERCENT TO THEIR STATE CONTRACTS. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. WE DO NOT EXPECT THERE TO BE A COST THE STATE'S IMPLEMENT THIS RATHER WE EXPECT SUPPORT OF STAVING. ADDITIONALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO INCREASE THE DOLLAR PREPARATION FOR INCLUSIVITY RATES THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS AND BILL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. THE INCREASE WILL BE FOR THREE POINT NINE MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND THIRTY MILLION GENERAL FUND. WE WERE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO CALCULATE THE COST PROVIDING NEW ADJUSTMENT FACTORS BASED OFF CONTRACT LEVEL DATA. AS OPPOSED TO SYSTEM WIDE TOTALS AS DONE IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. FINALLY THE MAY REVISION PROPOSES TO ADMIT JUST FACTOR OF ONE POINT EIGHT FOR TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AS WE EXPECT THE NUMBER OF TWO YEAR OLDS THAT ARE GOING TO BE CIRCULAR. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE ON TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MORNING INTERPRETATIVE ELLIE L. AND WE JUST HAVE A COMMENT WITH REGARD TO THE MEAN REVISION PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE REIMBURSING STATE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ARE FULL CONTRACT AMOUNT REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THEY SERVE WELL THE PROPOSAL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR BOTH CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING A MULTI YEAR CLASSES TRANSITION TO FUNDING EXCLUSIVELY BASED ON ENROLLMENT IN THE FUTURE. WITH A MULTI YEAR PLAN CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WOULD HAVE CLEAR EXPECTATIONS TO HELP THEM WORK TOWARDS SERVING THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THEY DID PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. THANK YOU AND I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THANK YOU N. I WOULD NOTE AGAIN OUR PREVIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT FACILITIES AND STAFF BUT LET ME ASK MAYBE THE ADMINISTRATION ONE QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW WE'RE JUST. ALMOST OUT OF TIME AND I NEED TO HAVE SOME MEASURE OF PUBLIC COMMENT HERE. ARM IS THE MOST RECENT ENROLLMENT DATA FOR THE SCHOOL YEAR SHOWED THAT THE LARGEST DECLINE IN AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE WAS IN THE KINDERGARTEN. THROUGH THIRD GRADE CATEGORY. AND I WONDERED IF THE ADMINISTRATION ANTICIPATES WITHIN ITS UPDATED ESTIMATES FOR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- IS THIS EXPANSION ON THE IT BASED ON THE FACT THAT THE ENROLLMENT WILL RECOVER SOON OR WOULD THIS SAME LOS BE EXPERIENCED FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS HOW DOES THAT DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN THOSE GRADES- IMPACT WHAT YOU'RE BRINGING FORWARD IN THIS PROGRAM. STODDERT CHAIRMAN I CHRIS FERGUSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO CERTAINLY IT REDUCES THE OVERALL COST TO IMPLEMENT- YOU KNOW UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- IT ISN'T A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OVER THE MULTI YEAR PERIOD- THAT SAID- WE DO HERE YOUR BROADER QUESTION AROUND- DECLINING ENROLLMENT TRENDS WOULD YOU PROPOSE THAT THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGING USING- YOU KNOW CURRENT YEAR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE- IN A MODIFIED VERSION THAT WILL HELP. FOR THE TRADITIONAL- I ENROLLMENT DECLINES THAT THAT YOU WERE NOTING BUT IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL- PROPOSAL FOR A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN YOU KNOW WE SAW THE IMPACT IS RELATIVELY MINOR WHEN IT WAS SPECIFIC TO- JUST THE T. K. PROJECTION. THANK YOU AND SO IN SHORT. THOSE DECLINING ENROLLMENT FIGURES ARE BODY DID WHAT YOU'RE RECOMMENDING HERE. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT QUESTIONS FROM ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES ON THE SIDE NO FROM SENATOR MENSEN ROACH JOB. I DO AND- JUST. UNSURE OF WHAT OUR FUTURE COMMITTEE HEARINGS WILL BE- COVERING RATHER NOT READ HAVING I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WITH REGARDS TO. THE AB PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS BOTH INTO DELIVERY AND THE AB. TYPES OF PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SPECIAL WITH THE REVISED AND SO FORTH JUST TO GET. SPECIFIC- ISSUES ADDRESSED ONE- I'M CREATURES I HAVE I PERSONALLY HAVE A BILL IN- IN SENATE APPROPRIATIONS I'M I'M SORRY IN THE ASSEMBLY AND ASKING THE STALLED THERE BUT IT'S WITH REGARDS TO PARENT ENGAGEMENT AB PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I'M SORT OF CURIOUS I I'VE READ- IN SOME OF OUR THE NAY REVISIONS THAT I HEAR THAT THERE IS A WELLNESS MINDFUL PROGRAMS THAT ALLOCATE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO SUPPORT GRANTS FOR WELLNESS MINDFUL. MINDFULNESS PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES AND EXPANSION OF PARENT SUPPORT AND TRAINING PROGRAMS- AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE. IN THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE IN WHICH THE MAY REVIEW REVISION INCLUDES A ONE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO CONTINUE THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE WHICH DISSEMINATES BEST PRACTICES FOR SCHOOL COMMUNITY INTERACTION- AND SO FORTH SO IF I WERE TO ASK AND IF WE HAD INTERESTED- VESTED STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO. LEARN ABOUT PARENT PARTICIPATION PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AS AN ADDITIONAL DELIVERY OR AB- TYPE OF A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AVAILABLE IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I'M WHICH WITH THERE BE ANYWHERE HERE WHERE THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS COULD BE- APPROPRIATED OR- IT IT IMPLEMENTED UNDER WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET. I KNOW WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AND I KNOW THE SACRAMENTO BEE COUPLE AT EIGHT REPRESENT A COUPLE OF. TIMES IN THIS COMMITTEE WITH REGARDS TO YOU READING AND OUR SCORES IN THE STATE I KNOW WE'RE ALLOCATING A LOT OF FUNDING IN IN TRAINING READING SPECIALISTS AND SO FORTH BUT ONE OF THE COMPONENTS SAID THE ARTICLE DRESS WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF PARENT ENGAGEMENT AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE- YOUNGER. A STUDENT POPULATION THAT WE INCLUDE OUR PARENTS AND REALLY EMPOWERING THEM WITH THE RESOURCES AND A LARGE BASE OF TOOLS THE TWO KIDS TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM. OUT BE BETTER PREPARED PARENTS NAVIGATING THEIR STUDENTS EDUCATIONAL BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSICAL- ACADEMIC WELL BEING- THE BETTER WE WILL BE IN CALIFORNIA SO I'M KIND OF CURIOUS- ASKED YOU IF THERE'S ANYTHING WITHIN THIS THIS MAY REVISED WHERE WE COULD. INCLUDE BUT OUR SCHOOLS OUR COMMUNITIES COULD ACTUALLY- HAVE FUNDING FOR THESE TYPE OF PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND WHO IS YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED I GUESS IT WOULD BE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE GREAT AND I SEE THREE DIFFERENT PEOPLE I THINK FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID. WHAT I WANTED TO PICK. ONE AND DECIDE WHO'S GOING TO RESPOND. INFORMALITY THE DIFFERENT OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO REST ON ON BEHALF OF OUR T. THERE- I DID WANT TO TACKLE YOUR- SENATOR. THE ENGAGEMENT INITIATIVE WELL THAT INITIATIVE HAS NOT FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS AND IS FOCUSED. ON MORE BROADLY PARENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE- YOU KNOW PARENTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT ARE AND FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON A PRESCHOOL ISSUES ARE SUPPORTING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. SO THERE'S DEFINITELY AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT THROUGH THROUGH THAT AVENUE- IT WILL SAY THAT THE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET IS- IT'S AN AUGMENTATION TO I AM AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN THE PROGRAM IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I MEAN HAS BEEN UNDER WAY BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT THIS AS SECOND MORE AND MORE ROBUST AROUND THE WORLD YOU FOR COMPREHENSIVE AND FOCUSED ON AREAS I'M- INCLUDING AT A PRESCHOOL STUDENT TO STUDENT VOICES ANOTHER ONE OR HELPING WILL BE ELEVATED. FURTHER IN THE SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING. I WOULD JUST WANT TO JUST. ENCOURAGE- ALL OF US TO TRULY LOOKINTO HAVING MAKE PERHAPS MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN. CLEARLY IDENTIFY AS A SOURCE FOR FUNDING FOR- PRESCHOOL PARENT PARTICIPATION WE HAVE A LOT OF DELIVERIES AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING IT MAKES DELIVERY ON THAT BUT I HAVEN'T YET SEEN ONE THAT SPECIFICALLY- DIRECTS OR ALLOWS FOR PARENTS TO BE IN THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND WE I KNOW WE'VE HAD. SEVERAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE INCLUDING HERE IN IN SACRAMENTO AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN EXISTENCE HAVE EXISTED AT THE SUCCESSFUL BUT YET WE HAVEN'T HAD IT- DIRECT FUNDING FOR IT AND WE'VE HAD WE'VE LOST SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATESO I WOULD. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT WE EAT WE EAT. TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF RESPONSIBILITY AND- DIRECTORS FUNDING FOR THESE APPROACH BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE INCREDIBLY POWERFUL- IN THAT. AND THEN ANOTHER SUGGESTION THAT I WANT TO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. I'M BEING THAT WE DO HAVE OUT I JUST SPOKE WITH THE GROUP WITH REGARDS TO PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW. PARENTS TO. HAVE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO HELP THEIR THEIR STUDENTS TEACH READING AND SO FORTH ANOTHER FLEXIBILITY. IN IN THESE PROGRAMS BUT SOMETHING. HAPPENED THAT COULD- DIRECT FUNDING FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS- SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AND JUST PUNTING THE SEED HERE IS TO ALLOW LANGUAGE SUCH AS QUOTEUNQUOTE DISTRICT OR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION PROVIDED INSTRUCTIONAL TOOLS AND CAPACITY BUILDING. FOR PARENT ENGAGEMENT IN STUDENT LEARNING- WE TALK ABOUT GIVING A LOT OF LOCAL FLEXIBILITY AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT I THINK HAVING DIRECT LANGUAGE SO WE CAN UTILIZE. AND KIND OF PULL FROM SO WE CAN HAVE. MORE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS WORK FOR PARENTING GAUGE MEANT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR EDUCATIONAL ENDEAVORS BECAUSE- QUITE FRANKLY WE ALL AGREED THAT. OUR OUR STUDENTS ARE IN THE CLASSROOM FOR AN AVERAGE OF SIX TO EIGHT HOURS BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO GO HOME AND UNLESS WE REALLY EMPOWER PARENTS TO HAVE THE SKILL SETS THE KNOWLEDGE BASE- THE TOOL KITS THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER FOR THAT FOR I TO BETTER SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS. OR THEIR CHILDREN- YOU KNOW WE WON'T BE AS EFFECTIVE AS WE CAN BE SO IF I COULD JUST PLANT THOSE SEEDS- TO ALL OF YOU AND- AS WE MOVE FORWARD I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN. ACCOMMODATE THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR I. YOUR COMMENTS AND I. AM CONFIDENT EVERYBODY IS NOTING THEM FOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD. SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS THAT COMPLETE ISSUE SIX. IN THE ONE ITEM WE HAVE LAUGHED IS TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE HAVE RUN OUT OF TIME SO I'M GONNA TRY TO DO AS ABBREVIATED. AS POSSIBLE SO IF YOU ADDRESSED IT AND ALL START WITH IN THE ROOM.
