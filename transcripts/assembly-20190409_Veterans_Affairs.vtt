00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.733
MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH

THIS -- BEGAN IN NINETEEN SIXTY

00:16:43.302 --> 00:16:46.271
NINE AND ROLLED INTO EARLY.

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:46.872
NINETEEN SEVENTY THIS WAS THE

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:49.508
TAIL END OF PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.310
JOBS -- PROGRAM.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:52.311
I WAS HIRED INTO THE AEROSPACE

00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:54.079
INDUSTRY.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.415
AND BECAUSE I WAS A VETERAN.

00:16:56.482 --> 00:16:57.983
I WAS ON THE FLOOR OF A

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.718
CLASSIFIED BEAUTY CENTER WITHIN

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:01.954
TWO WEEKS AFTER ORIENTATION.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:03.989
SIMPLY BECAUSE OF THAT FACT.

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:06.892
AS A TIME WHEN ON MY CLEARANCES

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.460
ALSO -- GREW AND MY

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.062
OPPORTUNITIES GREW ALONG WITH

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:12.564
THAT -- TO THE EXTENT MY LAST

00:17:12.631 --> 00:17:15.901
JOB WAS IN AUSTRALIA -- WORRY

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.403

S. C. I. CLEARANCE -- FOR THE

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.975
THE BOTTOM LINE THE WAY I SEE IT

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.309
HERE IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.411
THINGS HAPPENING.

00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:26.712
THERE'S THE PRESIDENTIAL

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:28.814

TRAINED PERSONNEL THEY NEED FOR

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.025
THAT SO THERE'S A STRONG

00:17:40.092 --> 00:17:41.059
EMPHASIS THERE.

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:43.061
AND PART OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:45.531
