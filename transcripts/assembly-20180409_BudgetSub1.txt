THIS WILL BEGIN TODAY'S SOMEONE HEARING. ON MONDAY APRIL NINTH. WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR INFORMATIONAL ISSUE MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA ISSUE ONE WE GET OUT THE FIRST PANEL COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU TO A CHAIR ARAMBULA ON MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. I'M CATHERINE TEAR I'M ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF HIGH VALUE CARE AT THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE FOUNDATION AND TO BE ABLE TO OFFER SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION ON MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN CALIFORNIA. TO START OFF THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION IS A NONPROFIT INDEPENDENT PHILANTHROPY WITH OFFICES IN OAKLAND IN SACRAMENTO. OUR FOCUS IS GRANT MAKING TO IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND SPECIFICALLY WE'RE DEDICATED TO ADVANCING MEANINGFUL MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE WAY THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM PROVIDES CARE TO PEOPLE. IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY THOSE WITH LOW INCOMES AND THOSE WHO WERE POORLY SERVED BY THE STATUS QUO. IN MARCH WE PUBLISHED MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA FOR TOO MANY CARE NOT THERE AND I HAVE COPIES OF THAT FOR A MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TODAY. THIS IS A REPORT IN OUR ALMANAC SERIES OF PUBLICATIONS WHICH COMPILED COMPILE THE MOST RECENT AVAILABLE DATA ON DIFFERENT TOPICS. TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE STATUS OF HEALTH CARE IN THE STATE. MY FOCUS TODAY WILL BE ON THE FOLLOWING AREAS FROM THE REPORT PREVALENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACCESS TO CARE. AND I FIRST WANT TO CREDIT THE REPORT'S AUTHOR WENDY HOLDS OF DMA HEALTH STRATEGIES FOR HER WORK IN PUTTING THE REPORT TOGETHER. WE LAST PUBLISHED A VERSION OF THIS ALMANAC IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. THE DATA FOR THE REPORT COMES FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES FEDERAL SOURCES LIKE THE CENSUS IN THE SAHARA SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. STATE PROGRAM DATA FROM DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES OFFICE POD CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND MANY OTHERS. AND WHILE THE SOURCE IS VERY MUCH OF THE DATA IN THE REPORT IS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY FIFTEEN. SO WE ALL KNOW THERE BEEN VERY A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE THEN INCLUDING EXPANSION ABOUT A CAL FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND MENTAL HEALTH PARITY. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTED IN THE DATA WE SEE AND AS WE MOVE ALONG I'M ALSO GOING TO OFFER A FEW BITS OF INFORMATION FROM A STATEWIDE POLL THAT WE SUPPORTED THAT WAS DONE BY UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY. SO. TO START THE PREVALENCE STATE OF THAT I'M GOING TO PRESENT IS FROM AN ANALYSIS THAT SO OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE. FOUNDATION COMMISSION FROM CHARLES HOLZER. THESE RESEARCHERS ARE WELL KNOWN HERE IN CALIFORNIA THEY PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED ESTIMATES TO THE FORMER DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. IN ITS CALIFORNIA MENTAL THE METS AND ESTIMATES FOR SUB POPULATIONS ARE UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST TIME THEY WERE DONE THAT USED TWO THOUSAND NINE DATA SO WERE. USING DATA FROM FIVE YEARS LATER. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE IN TWENTY FOUR ADULTS THAT'S ABOUT FOUR PERCENT OF ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. EXPERIENCEDA SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DEFINED AS A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER RESULTING IN A FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT THAT INTERFERES WITH OR LIMITS MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES. A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE IN THAT TOP STRIPE OF ORANGE ABOUT ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIANS OR FIFTEEN PERCENT OF OUR STATE ADULT POPULATION EXPERIENCED ANY MENTAL ILLNESS. IN OTHER WORDS THEY ALSO HAD A MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT SO THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE WHOSE MENTAL ILLNESS CAUSES. SERIOUS OR MODERATE OR MILD FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT. AMONG CHILDREN IN THE GREEN FIGURES MORE THAN SEVEN PERCENT OR ONE IN THIRTEEN HAD A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THAT'S A MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER THAT SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITS FUNCTIONING. IN FAMILY SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES AND THERE IS NO ACQUITTAL AND. CATEGORY FOR CHILDREN OF OF THE ANY MENTAL ILLNESS DISORDER IN ADULTS AND THAT'S WHY WE DON'T SEE THE. LARGER PERCENTAGE IN CHILDREN AND AGAIN AS I SAID THESE NUMBERS ARE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE. SO I NOW WANT TO DIG INTO A LITTLE BIT THE VARIATION THAT WE SEE ACROSS THE STATE. THE FIRST SLIDE SHOWS US SOME REGIONAL VARIATION. THE RATE OF SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AMONG CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA VARY FROM A HIGH OF EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. TO A LOW OF SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT IN THE BAY AREA. THOSE OF THE GREEN BARS THOSE ARE CHILDREN THERE AND THE AVERAGE AGAIN IS ABOUT SEVEN POINT SIX PERCENT. AMONG ADULTS THE PREVALENCE OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. WHICH IS THE ORANGE BARS RANGED FROM A HIGH OF FIVE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE NORTHERN SIERRA REGION. TO A LOW OF THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE GREATER BAY AREA BAY AREA. THERE'S ALSO THAT. THERE'S ALSO VARIABILITY WHICH I DIDN'T INCLUDE ON THE SLIDE BY GENDER AND BY AGE SO WOMEN A CALIFORNIA WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY THAN MEN TO EXPERIENCE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AT A RATE OF FOUR POINT EIGHT PERCENT VERSUS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT. AND THE AGE RANGE SHOWS A. A SORT OF A. A STANDARD DISTRIBUTION WITH LOWER RATES IN THE YOUNGEST VERY YOUNGEST ADULT AGE GROUPS AND ALSO THE OLDEST TO DATE DULLED AGE GROUPS ON THE PEAK IN THE. THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FOUR AGE GROUP. PREVALENCE VARIES BY RACE AND ETHNICITY AS WELL YOU'LL SEE A MUCH GREATER OF DIFFERENCE AMONG ADULTS ON THE RIGHT HAND. CHART THAN AMONG CHILDREN. THE. IT'S TRUE THOUGH THE CHILDREN YOU DO SEE SOME DIFFERENTIAL WITH. LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER CHILDREN OF HAVING RATES OF SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE CLOSER TO EIGHT PERCENT WITH. WHITE ASIAN AND MULTI RACIAL CHILDREN CLOSER TO SEVEN PERCENT. FOR ADULTS AS I SAID SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER VARIABILITY NATIVE AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND MULTI RACIAL ADULTS HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THE LOWEST RATES AND AGAIN THESE NUMBERS ARE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE DATA SO WE HAVE SEEN THESE BEFORE AND WE. WE DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE. LAST SLIDE ON PREVALENCE ON QUICKLY IS BY INCOME. AND AGAIN THIS LOOKS VERY SIMILAR FOR ADULTS IN ORANGE AND CHILDREN IN GREEN IT'S IS FAR MORE COMMON TO SEE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE IN CHILDREN. ARM AMONG PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVELS UNDER A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. I NOW WANT TO SHIFT FOCUS TO A TOPIC THAT I KNOW IS OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO EVERYONE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THAT'S ACCESS TO CARE. THE DATA I'M PRESENTING COMES FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SOURCES SO I DO WANT TO CAUTION THAT NOT EVERYTHING THAT'S PRESENTED HERE CAN BE DIRECTLY COMPARED. FOR INSTANCE ACROSS AGE GROUPS BUT IT IS DIRECTIONALLY. I THINK. ALL LINES UP AND WHAT IT SHOWS IS THAT FOR CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION AS A WHOLE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT AND CONCERNING GAPS IN ACCESS TO CARE. AND THAT BY AND LARGE THAT SITUATION HAS NOT IMPROVED SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINE. SO THIS LIVE SHOWS THAT ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A THIRD OF CALIFORNIA ADULTS THAT'S THE PORTION OF REFLECTED IN BLUE ON THIS CHART. WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS RECEIVED TREATMENT OR COUNSELING DURING THE PRIOR YEAR THIS IS A COMPOSITE OF FOUR YEARS OF DATA BUT THEY'RE LOOKING BACK A YEAR. THAT'S A HOLLOW LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY THREE PERCENT AND IS ABOUT THE SAME THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. IT'S NOT SHOWN HERE BUT THERE'S SOME INTERESTING DATA TO THAT'S IN THE ALMANAC OF THE REPORT ITSELF. THAT SHOWS THAT EVEN AMONG THE CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHO REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SOUGHT CARE TREATMENT FOR THEIR MENTAL ILLNESS SEVENTEEN PERCENT REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT GET IT. AND THAT LINES UP WITH. SURVEY DATA THAT WE GOT FROM THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA BERKELEY POLL WHICH SIMILARLY FOUND BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY PERCENT OF PEOPLE. SAYING THAT THEY HAD SOUGHT CARE FOR THEMSELVES OR A FAMILY MEMBER FOR A MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN AND HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RECEIVE IT. AND THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS WITH THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND A COUNSELOR OR A DOCTOR WHO WOULD ACCEPT THEIR INSURANCE OR THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE COST. NOW WHEN WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT ADULTS WHO REPORT MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODES VERSUS THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHICH WAS ANY MENTAL ILLNESS. WE SEE US LATE WE SEE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER FUND OUTCOME IN THIS CASE ABOUT CHART ON THE RIGHT THE BLUE. IS THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS REPORTING MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO DID GET TREATMENT. SO THAT'S ABOUT TWO THIRDS. THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER. AND. AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE I THINK THE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR THAT IS MORE LIKE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT SO CALIFORNIA'S STILL BEHIND. IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RECEIVING CARE EVEN FOR A VERY SERIOUS ILLNESS LIKE MAJOR DEPRESSION. BUT THIS IS A SLIDE THAT I THINK. IS PROBABLY. THE MOST CONCERNING OF ALL THE NUMBERS EVER IN REPORTING TODAY SO THESE ARE ADOLESCENTS. ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THE ORANGE BAR A CALIFORNIA NUMBERS AND THAT IS THE OF. PROPORTION OF A PERCENTAGE OF ADOLESCENTS WHO REPORT HAVING HAD A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN THE PAST YEAR. AND. THOSE NUMBERS ARE AMONG THE ONLY ONCE WE SEE THAT HAVE CHANGED FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE AND THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO THE NUMBER OF ADOLESCENCE REPORTING MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IS UP TO TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT OR ONE IN EIGHT ADOLESCENTS FIVE YEARS AGO. IN IN THE. EIGHT OH NINE YEAR THAT WAS EIGHT PERCENT SO THAT'S NEARLY A FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE REPORTING MAJOR I'M DEPRESSIVE EPISODE AND THEN ON THE RIGHT. THIS IS REALLY THE REVERSE OF THE CHART I JUST SHOWED FOR ADULTS THE GREEN IS THE PROPORTION OF ADOLESCENCE WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE REPORT HAVING RECEIVED TREATMENT. THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD. AND LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL RATE. JUST WANT TO MAKE. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. IN PROVIDING CARE IN OF THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH SO THE CHART ON THE LEFT IS FOR ALL HEALTH CARE AND YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE PURPLE AND THE TEAL. BANDS WHICH ARE MEDICAID FUNDING AND OTHER PUBLIC FUNDING AT UP TO ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL FUNDING THAT'S FOR ALL HEALTH CARE. AS COMPARED TO MUCH BIGGER PORTIONS FOR PRIVATE AND MEDICARE. BUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH. MEDICAID AND OTHER PUBLIC DOLLARS MAKEUP OF MORE THAN HALF. OF THE SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE NO THESE ARE NATIONAL NUMBERS NOT CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE THEM FOR CALIFORNIA. BUT WE THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY TRACKS HERE AND IT JUST LEADS I'M. REALLY TO MY FINAL POINT WHICH IS THAT. ARE IN CALIFORNIA THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS. IS IS OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM SYSTEM BY AND LARGE AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT AND. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING I'M I WANTED TO THE FLAG OF THESE NUMBERS JUST AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE OUTSIZE ROLE THAT THE PUBLIC SYSTEM PLAYS. IN THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS THIS IS THE NUMBER THE USE OF MEDI CAL SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE INCREASE. OF FROM I THINK THAT'S TWENTY TWELVE THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN. OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND THAT OBVIOUSLY AND TO RETURN TO A THEME FROM EARLIER REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF MEDI CAL EXPANSION. FROM THE MUCH GREATER ACCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE. SO FOR OUR FOUNDATION GOING FORWARD WILL BE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF THIS ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION OF EXPANSION OF BENEFITS OF THE WORK THAT. THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES HAVE DONE TO OUR BRING NEW PROGRAMS ONLINE TO PROVIDE MORE INTEGRATED CARE TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS OF PROVIDING SERVICES. AND SEE WHAT ALL OF THOSE CHANGES. HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO TO AFFECT HEALTH OUTCOMES ACCESS TO CARE AND OF COURSE BECAUSE. SO I THINK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT THIS AFTERNOON I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND. TO SHARE MORE MATERIAL SINCE AS IS HELPFUL GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION I'VE. WANTED TO SUMMARIZE A FEW OF THE DATA POINTS IF I COULD AND THEN. REALLY WANTED TO ASK YOU A A LEADING QUESTION IF I MAY. BUT WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THIS INFORMATION YOU'RE SAYING A SIX OF ALL ADULTS. IT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM THAT'S IN FRONT OF US. IN THIS HEARING TODAY AS WE START ADDRESSING. ISSUES THAT AFFECT ONE OF US WHO ARE ON THIS DIET RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US TO MAKE SURE WERE ADEQUATELY FACING THE INFORMATION THAT'S BEFORE US. THE DATA POINTS I'M INTERESTED IN IS YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S A THIRTY PERCENT INCREASE IN INPATIENT HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THAT TWO THIRDS OF ALL ADULTS ARE NOT GETTING. OUT WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ARE NOT GETTING TREATMENT THAT TWO THIRDS OF ALL ADOLESCENTS ARE NOT GETTING TREATMENT FROM A MAJOR. DEPRESSIVE EPISODES THOSE ARE CONCERNING STATISTICS FOR ME AND A SYMPTOM THAT OUR SYSTEM MAY NOT BE PERFORMING AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE MAY BELIEVE IT IS. AND THE LEADING QUESTION IF I MAY IS ON PAGE FOURTEEN. AND IT'S REGARDING THE. PERCENTAGE OF POST NATAL AND PRENATAL DEPRESSION. AND WHEN WE RECOGNIZE THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF ALL OF OUR MOTHERS. ARE EXPERIENCING SOME FORM OF PRENATAL OR POST NATAL DEPRESSION WHAT ARE WE AS A SYSTEM OR A STATE DOING TO HELP TO PREVENT THAT TOWARDS TO HELP EDUCATE. OUR YOUNG MOTHERS AND AND I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A PERSONAL. PITCH CHAIR WHEN MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY. AND WHERE A TWO. HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD FAMILY AND HAVE OUR FEET BELOW US AND UNDERSTAND THE STRESS THAT OUR YOUNG MOTHERS GO THROUGH. AND REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE DOING AS THE STATE'S TO ADDRESS THIS BEST VIC ISSUE. THANKS AND I'M GLAD YOU RAISED THAT AND I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY NO ONE IN THIS ROOM WHO IS AND WHO ISN'T FAMILIAR WITH. THOSE ISSUES OF MENTAL. HEALTH DISORDERS AROUND PREGNANCY AND POST PARTUM PERIOD OR FRANKLY. OR IN GENERAL SO. I CERTAINLY I I CERTAINLY I HAVE LIVED THAT AS WELL. I THINK. THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED ATTENTION AND THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF NEW WORK THAT IS FOCUSING ON PERINATAL DEPRESSION I'M AND ANXIETY. A GENERAL PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS I THINK SOME OF THE PANELS I'M COMING UP WERE FOLLOWING ME WHO ARE MUCH MORE. CLOSE TO THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE. IN THE COUNTIES A AND AT THE STATE CAN PROBABLY SPEAK TO THAT QUESTION AS WELL. ON THAT IS ONE WHERE. ON THAT SLIDE FOURTEEN. I THINK AND IT'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO NOTE A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES BY OF IN THIS CITY. IN THE RATES OF PEOPLE REPORTING OF. OF POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION I THINK IN THAT CASE I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME. SO IT IS AN AREA WHERE WE REALLY NEED TO BE FOCUSING A NOT ONLY ON IDENTIFICATION. POST THE BIRTH OF THE BABY BUT REALLY WORKING THAT INTO OUR PRENATAL CARE AND I KNOW THAT A NUMBER OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. A NUMBER OF OUR COUNTIES ARE WORKING ON INITIATIVES LIKE THAT AND I'D BE HAPPY TO GET MORE DETAIL ON THAT AND BRING IT BACK. RICK. WITH THAT WANTED TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS OTHERWISE I BELIEVE IT WAS A WONDERFUL FRAMING FOR TODAY'S. A COMMITTEE HEARING AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO SERGEANTS AYE COMPORT DONE WITH THE. SLIDESHOW SEMANSKY IF WE CAN TO MOVE SOME OF THIS EQUIPMENT. THANK YOU. WHEN YOU RECORD OR RENT WHEN YOU'RE READY DIRECTOR. GREAT SO I GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER CAN'T WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WANTED TO JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF QUICK MOMENTS JUST TO KIND OF GIVE PRIDE. PERSPECTIVE ON HOW THE DEPARTMENT OPERATES BOTH WITH THE COMMISSION AS WELL AS WITH THE COUNTIES AS IT PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH. WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WORK THAT SIEGE CF. JUST RECENTLY SPOKE OF WE PARTNER WITH THEM. FOR A VARIETY OF INITIATIVES. AND THEY HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN QUITE INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING US DO A LOT OF WORK AROUND ARE ORGANIZED DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM WAIVER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WORKING WITH AND COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS AND HOW WE STRUCTURE A LOT OF OPIOID DISORDER STUFF AND SO. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE BEEN AND JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR. PARTNERSHIP AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IS THE DEPARTMENT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA ON IT IS A FAIRLY. INTERWOVEN AND TIGHTLY. COMPLICATED I IMMEDIATELY COMPLICATED DISCUSSION FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT IT'S A STATE DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES THE DELIVERY OF SYSTEMS THROUGH A COUNTY BASED ORGANIZED SYSTEM AROUND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH BOTH FOR PEDIATRIC AND ADULT POPULATIONS. WE WILL. PROBABLY TO THEY USE THE TERM BRAIDED FUNDING A LOT FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WHEN COUNTIES ARE DELIVERING SERVICES TO ON EITHER. PEDIATRIC OR ADULT POPULATIONS THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY CAN USE TO HELP DELIVER THOSE SERVICES ON IN MEDI CAL. OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION IS A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COUNTIES BUT THEY CAN USE. NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT FUNDING THEY CAN USE THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT THAT WAS. DEDICATED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN THEY CAN USE THEIR MHSAA FUNDING THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL SAP DE BLOCK GRANT AND SO WHEN COUNTIES HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS SEEKING TREATMENT DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED WHATEVER'S MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE THEY CAN USE A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES IF NOT ALL OF THOSE AND SO IT GETS. PRETTY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO KIND OF PULL OUT CERTAIN FUNDING SOURCES AND SAY WELL IS THIS. YOU KNOW PARTICULAR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MHSAA TODAY ON IT IS ONE FUNDING STREAM THAT HELPS. AUGMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY IS AN IMPORTANT FUNDING SOURCE BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY FUNDS ARE SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF. LAY THAT OUT BEFORE WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME FOCUS JUST ON THE MHSAA. THE AUDIT THAT. WAS CONDUCTED BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR I'M YOU KNOW WE. AGREED WITH A NUMBER OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE AUDITOR MADE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT WE EITHER DISAGREED WITH ARE PARTIALLY AGREED WITH. I THINK THAT WE HAVE. BOTH UNDERTAKEN AND CONTINUE TO SEEK WAYS TO IMPROVE BOTH THE DELIVERY AND USE OF THOSE. SERVICES AND THOSE FUNDING. STREAMS IN A WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTIES WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMISSION BUT ALSO IN BROAD BRUSH STROKES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE ACT YOU KNOW APPROXIMATELY. THIRTEEN AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS HAVE BEEN EXPENDED BY THE COUNTIES AND A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SERVICE. BUCKETS. LEAVING THAT TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THAT SUBJECT TO REVERSION BUT WHEN YOU START TO KIND OF LOOK AT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT THEY ARE. BEING USED TODAY THEY ARE IMPOVING LIVES AND HELPING. EASE SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ILLNESS THAT IS PRESENT IN THE STATE OBVIOUSLY CAN MORE BE DONE. ABSOLUTELY ARE WE COMMITTED TO WORKING YOU KNOW AND I'M YOU KNOW MORE EITHER EFFICIENT OR EFFECTIVE WAY. ABSOLUTELY BUT I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF ALSO JUST PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE IN THAT IMAGE TO SAY IS A VERY IMPORTANT. FUND SOURCE AND FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ON DEDICATED THROUGH THIS REVENUE SOURCE THE COUNTIES ARE ABSOLUTELY USING THEM ALL THE DIFFERENT APPROPRIATE WAYS. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S HELPFUL FOR LEAN THE GROUNDS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY BUT ALSO WOULD DEFER TO. EITHER THE COUNTY USER ARE MISTER YOU MEAN FOR. FOR FURTHER CLARIFICATION. NEXT WE'LL HAVE BRENDA GREENISH IF YOU WANTED TO COMMENT OTHERWISE WE'RE MOVING ON TO TOBY EWING AND WE'LL COME BACK WITH QUESTIONS AT THE END RENDON MY. GET SHE'S MY. WHEN EIGHT HUNDRED DIAL IT EXPERT LINE UP FOR TODAY. FAIR ENOUGH W.. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU W. M. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR THE HOUSE SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. I I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS. EVIDENCED BY THE WORK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS DONE OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS YOU KNOW THERE IS A LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION. AROUND FISCAL TRANSPARENCY WE'VE WE'VE REALLY TRIED. PUSH HIM THREE COMPONENTS IN THE FIRST ONE IS MAKING IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND THE FUNDS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN SPENT AND HOW MUCH MONEY IS STILL IN THE BANK. WE ARE WORKING TO DO THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE THIRD PIECE OF THAT IS TO REPORT ON THE OUTCOMES AT LEAST THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH. THEM THE METRICS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE HOUSE SERVICES ACT REDUCING SUICIDE. HOMELESSNESS INCARCERATION REMOVAL OF CHILDREN FROM THEIR HOMES ETCETERA. AND. AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF REASONS FOR THAT. THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FOR THE PRIORITIZE IS MAKING SURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES HAVE. CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT'S HAPPENING INTO THE LOCAL A WHOLE SYSTEM AND HOW RESOURCES ARE BEING SPENT AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT IF YOU'VE EVER TRIED TO PARTICIPATE IN A LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULAS. DISCUSSION ON AB ONE A NINE DISCUSSION IT'S IT'S. NOT EVEN SOMEONE LIKE MYSELF WHO SPENT MANY YEARS WORKING GOVERNMENTS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEMS. THE COMMISSION'S BEEN TRYING TO MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE THAT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION. IS PART OF THE FOUNDATION THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. AND ALONG THE WAY WE'VE RUN INTO A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES INCLUDING LIMITATIONS AND REPORTING AND SO FORTH. BUT IN IN RECOGNITION INSTRUCTOR CAN SAYS IN AND MY COLLEAGUE TO THE RIGHT ARE ON BEHALF OF CITIES CA KIRSTEN WILL TELL YOU THAT. WE'VE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS WIN I THINK WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION. A REPORTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE AVAILABLE TO MUCH MORE AVAILABLE NOW. WE HAVE NOT JUST IN THE LAST FEW DAYS RELEASED AN UPDATE WHAT WE CALL A FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL. AND THAT WHEN WE STARTED THIS WORK AND THERE WERE THERE WERE I THINK I THINK ONE COUNTY REPORT FOR THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR BUT I THINK WE'RE UP TO ABOUT THIRTY SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES. SO THAT THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE COUNTIES ARE RESPONDING IN THE SPEED WITH WHICH THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE HAS INCLUDE HAS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS I WOULD SAY AND SO I I I THINK. I'M THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO TO TRY TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT. IT'S IT'S A MANDATE UNDER THE LAW BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IF THE COMMISSION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO. ESTABLISH THE SYSTEMS OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT ARE NECESSARY. PART OF THE STRATEGY FOR THE COMMISSION IS THAT IT'S LESS ABOUT THE COMMISSION BEING ABLE TO SORT OF PASS JUDGMENT ON THE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF WHO OF WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING. AND MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIGN OF REALIGNMENT BE ABLE TO ENABLE THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES AND TO PARTICIPATE SO THAT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY. SO I THINK AS YOU SAID YOU SAW ON THE AUDIT. AND DIRECTOR KENNETH APSLEY RIDE THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED IN HAVE BEEN SPENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ALTHOUGH HAVING SAID THAT TWO HUNDRED AND IN TWENTY HONOR TO COURT NEARLY A QUARTER BILLION DOLLARS UNSPENT FUNDS. ANNA IS A LOT OF MONEY AND THEY'RE SUCH TREMENDOUS FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF PROVIDERS AND PART OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITIES. THE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT BEING DEPLOYED IN WAYS THAT ARE THAT ARE. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTY IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ANOTHER COUNTIES WHERE WE'RE WE'RE GETTING CALLS FROM COUNTY SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ASKING US. TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS. THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR ANALYSIS IS WIERD THE FUNDS BEING SPENT AND WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF COMMENTS ABOUT THAT WE WE WE ARE NOT IN THE BEST POSITION TO REALLY. ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT WE'RE FRUSTRATED AS WELL. THAT THE INTENT OF THE IMAGE JUST SAY VERY CLEARLY WAS PROVIDE MORE FUNDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. TO ENSURE IMPROVE ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT THE SERVICES ARE OUTCOME ORIENTED RECOVERY ORIENTED THAT THEY'RE ENGAGING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND AND THAT THEIR DECEMBER DESIGNING SERVICES THAT ARE PREVENTION ORIENTED. I THINK WE HAVE MADE A MAKING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS BUT THERE'S AN EQUAL LEVEL OF FRUSTRATION. THAT THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO AS WELL. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO NEW ATTENDANT. KIRSTEN BARLOW'S NEXT. I HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS RELATED TO BOTH FEAR ISSUES IN THE AGENDA RELATED TO COUNTY REPORTING. AS WELL AS UNSPENT FUNDS BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE PLANNING TO GO INTO THE ACTUAL SET OF QUESTIONS OUR FOES WERE JUST SORT OF A GUIDE FOR CONVERSATION BOY WORLD IF YOU WOULD PREFER TO ADDRESS ISLAND AREA. AND I'M CERTAIN START THERE SO ON THE ISSUE OF COUNTY REPORTING I THINK. A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND I THINK THAT. THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE BE HDA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA COUNTIES UP WHO ARE DELIVERING MINIMAL SERVICES ACT. FUNDS ALONG WITH THEIR PROVIDERS HAVE HAVE COME TO SOME AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN DELAY IS NOT ONLY ON THE PART OF COUNTY SUBMITTING THEIR REPORTS BUT ALSO ON THE PART OF THE STATE AND PROVIDING INSTRUCTIONS. AND FORMS FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AYE WE HEAR THAT THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS AND I THINK EVEN THE CHART THAT'S ON THE AGENDA AROUND THE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. ARI OURS REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS IS A GOOD ILLUSTRATION OF THIS. SO AS YOU NOTE IN YOUR AGENDA EACH YEAR THE COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THE STATE A REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORT. DESCRIBING WHAT THEIR PRIOR YEAR AND EXPENDITURES WERE FOR THEM IN A WHOLE SERVICES ACT. AND THAT'S DUE TO THE STOCK TO THE STATE BY THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST OF EACH YEAR. AND WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY STANDARD PIECES OF INFORMATION AND THAT ARE COLLECTED IN REPORTED EVERY SINGLE FISCAL YEAR THE DEPARTMENT DOES. AT TIMES TEND TO A REVISED ITS INSTRUCTIONS ARE POTENTIALLY REVISE THE FORM. AND IN SOME CASES THAT DOES RESULT IN DELAYS IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TED TO PROVIDE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS TO COUNTIES AND IN SOME CASES LIKE THIS PAST YEAR. ERRORS WERE NOTED IN THE FORM AND THEN AT AN UPDATED VERSION WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES IN JANUARY A MONTH AFTER THE FORM IS ACTUALLY DUE TO THE STATES THAT THERE IS SORT OF A. A DOMINO EFFECT THAT HAPPENS IN THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE BEACH TO HAVE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY OF A SETTING UP. SORT OF A DATE BY WHICH THE DEPARTMENT AND US CAN WORK TOGETHER IN ADVANCE ABOUT DECEMBER THIRTY ONE DEADLINE TO ENSURE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONS FORMS AND ALL OF THAT. ARE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES IN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE SURE WE CAN RELIEVE ME ARE DEADLINE AS WELL. AND THEN THE OTHER COMPLICATION IS THAT. AS WAS POINTED OUT BY DIRECTOR CAN'T WE HAVE A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES MANY OF WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE BLENDED TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE IN A WHOLE SERVICES ACT. COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY CAN DRAW DOWN FEDERAL MATIC MEDICAID MATCHING FUNDS WITH THOSE EXPENDITURES. AND SO ONE OF THE CHICKEN AND EGG THINGS THAT HAPPENS WITH OUR REPORTING IS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE MHSAA REPORT DUE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST COUNTIES ALSO SUBMIT A SEPARATE REPORT TO THE STATE ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL MENTAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES. AND WE ACTUALLY USE A NUMBER OF THOSE DATA POINTS TO COMPLETE THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT REPORT TO BE ABLE TO SHOW HOW MUCH MHSAA IS BEING USED TO DROUGHT ON FEDERAL DOLLARS SO. AGAIN DELAYS IN EITHER OF THOSE SETS OF INSTRUCTIONS OR CHANGES THAT GET MADE FROM AND THE COUNTIES TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. I REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORT IS IN FACT AN AUDITABLE DOCUMENT AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER NOT EMPLOYEE OF THE DEVELOP DEPARTMENT BUT THE ACTUAL COUNTY AUDITOR CONTROLLER. MUST SIGNED UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY LA THAT THE INFORMATION THEY'RE SUBMITTING TO THE STATE IS TRUE AND FACTUAL TO THE BEST OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN THEY'RE ISSUES AROUND. DEFINITIONS OF THE FORMS. AND WHETHER THEY CAN ACCURATELY PRESENT THE INFORMATION THEY SOMETIMES ARE. DELAYED AND AND BEING ABLE TO ADD TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY FEEL THEY NEED. AND I THINK IN TERMS OF SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS A BIT WITH THE STATE. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT WHEN FIGURING OUT WAYS TO MAKE SURE THE DOLLARS COULD BE. TRANCE. TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC AND TAXPAYERS. THE COUNTIES HAVE LONG. HOPED THAT THE COST REPORT THAT I JUST DESCRIBED THAT WE FILL OUT FOR MEDI CAL COULD IN SOME WAY BE USED AS THE SAME MECHANISM FOR REPORTING ABOUT OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT REVENUES BECAUSE. HAVING TO REPORTS BE OUR HOPE THAT WE COULD SEE THOSE THINGS COMBINED. ADDITIONALLY. AND THE ORGAN IS A BY ORGANIZATION CB HDA IS. SPONSORING A BILL THIS YEAR S. B. SIX EIGHTY EIGHT BY SENATOR MORLOCK TO REQUIRE AT THE VERY LEAST THAT THOSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT REPORT PLATFORMS. BE BASED ON GAP GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES I'M SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT IN ADDITION TO BEING ABLE TO TRANSMIT THEM ELECTRONICALLY. THAT THERE'S MORE CONSISTENCY FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT ABOUT. WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS LOOK LIKE AND HOW AND WHAT THE STAFF AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ARE GOING TO NEED TO COLLECT AND HOW BEST TO REPORT THAT TO BE ACCURATE? SO SO BE MY COMMENTS ON THE REPORTING I HAVE SOME OTHER THOUGHTS ABOUT THE UNSPENT FUNDS ISSUE BUT CAN HOLD THOSE IN CASE THAT'S AN ISSUE THAT COMES UP LATER DURING THE SCRIPT ACTION. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIANA ON ISSUE TO. SEEING NONE WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TO FROM HEALTH CARE'S. I'M WELL I WILL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FINANCE EXPLAINED THE APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED IN THE AUDIT. IN SIMPLEST TERMS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WAS AND DISBANDED. TO IT WAS ESSENTIALLY CLEAVED INTO TWO PARTS OF THE DAY. DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS WHICH IS RUNNING OUR STATE MENTAL HOSPITALS AND THEN WE AS A DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ABSORBED ALL OF THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. COMPONENTS. SO A LOT OF THE STAFF IN THE PROGRAMMATIC. RESPONSIBILITY PORTS WHICH ACTUALLY TURNED OUT TO BE A PRIOR YEAR APPROPRIATION THAT REMAINED ON THE SCO'S RECORDS. AND SO THAT APPROPRIATION IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT TO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS DISPERSED. COUNTIES OR THE STATE ADMIN. THAT SOUND SPENT. SO AND AND AND SINCE THE FINDING YOU KNOW DATA FINANCE AND THE DEPARTMENT HAVE WORKED WITH THE SCO TO REMOVE IT FROM THE RECORDS BUT. IT SIMPLY WASN'T NOTHING MORE THAN WHY DID WE MAKE THAT DECISION. WHO? WELL SO THAT CAN. WHO? SO THIS GOES BACK A LONGER THAN I HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY WORKED KEEP BACK TO AT LEAST NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NINETY FIVE WHEN THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS WERE FIRST INITIALLY ESTABLISH SO. TRADITIONALLY UMPS THIS. STATE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MEDICAL PROGRAM ON THE PHYSICAL MEDICAL HEALTH SIDE THE COUNTIES HAD SOME FUNDING. REALIGNMENTS. NINETY ONE REALIGNMENTS THERE'S THE BRONZE AND MCCORQUODALE ACTS. WHERE THEY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND THEN? IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WE SAW OUR FIRST NINETEEN FIFTEEN WAIVER TO ALLOW FOR THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS TO BOTH BE CREATED AS WELL AS TO SERVE. ANY MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THROUGH THOSE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. IT IS A DIFFERENT. SYSTEM IN TERMS OF THE COUNTIES PUT UP THE NON FEDERAL SHARE OF THE REVENUE IN ORDER TO DRAW DOWN THE FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN HOW THE REST OF MEDI CAL STATE RIGHT NOW TO CALL. BY AND LARGE YOU THE STATE GENERAL FUND WITH SOME OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS BUT THE COUNTIES ARE BOTH. STATUTORILY AND NOW CONSTITUTIONALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR A SERIES OF SERVICES ESPECIALLY BASED ON THE LAST REALIGNMENT THAT WAS DONE TWENTY ELEVEN. FOR. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BOTH FROM THE ADULT AND PEDIATRIC SIDE ON SUBSTANCE USE DELIVERY. DRUG COURTS I'M GONNA GET ALL OF THE OTHER BIG ITEMS BUT THOSE ARE THE BIG TICKET ITEMS AND SO THERE IS ESSENTIALLY A. BOTH A FINANCIAL REVENUE STREAM THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COUNTIES AS WELL AS A CHANGE IN THE CONSTITUTION THE KIND OF PERMANENTLY. ENSHRINED THAT COUNTY BASED COUNTY OPERATED LOCALLY CONTROLLED AND SET OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES SO. IT HAS BEEN THAT WAY FOR. MANY MANY YEARS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WITH THE REALIGNMENT DECISION THAT WAS. FURTHER KIND OF FUN MADE MORE PERMANENT. I'D LIKE TO A FIGHT CAN SPEND A BIT OF TIME REALLY DISCUSSING FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THAT MEANS AS A STATE. WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN INSURING THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE APPROPRIATED THESE FUNDS IN A MEANINGFUL? EFFECTIVE WAY. AND HOW ARE WE TRACKING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S BEING DONE. SURE SO I'LL TAKE A. STAB IN THAN OTHERS CAN CHIME IN SO I THINK THE. AS THE AUDIT NOTED. COUNTIES SO. WE DON'T CLAIM NOR DO WE AUTHORIZE SERVICES FOR MHSAA RIGHT SO THE COUNTIES RECEIVE MHSAA FUNDS DIRECTLY AND THEY ARE THEN ALLOWED TO. CHANGE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND CRACK. WAS THAT IS THAT. A CHANGE THAT HAS BENEFITED US AS THE STATE TO ENSURE OVERSIGHT. OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO COME BACK IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE FOUND WITH THIS ON IT LOVING I WOULD SAY. I THINK WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. WAS STILL. OPERATIONAL NAM BEFORE IT WAS DISSOLVED I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIG FRUSTRATIONS OF A LOT OF COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS FELT WAS IN ORDER TO SPEND A MINT MHSAA FUNDS. ALL OF THAT HAD TO BE APPROVED FIRST BY THE DEPARTMENT AND I THINK WHEN THE DEPARTMENT. WAS DISBANDED THAT WAS A CHANGES REQUIRED VOTE OF TWO THIRDS OF THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IT AMENDED THE ACT I'M LOOKING FOR. NODS TO MAKE SURE THAT I'VE GOT MY FACTS STRAIGHT. AND SO I THINK IF YOU ASKED. BE THERE PROVIDERS ARE COUNTIES THEY WOULD SAY IT ACTUALLY HELPS. BOTH SPEED THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES. IT CERTAINLY I MADE SURE THAT THE COUNTIES WERE GETTING FUNDS IN A TIMELY WAY IN ORDER TO HELP DELIVER SIR SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEIR LOCAL. PLANNING AND. KIND OF. I LOCAL CONVERSATION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT IN THE RIGHT WAY. THE BACK END OVERSIGHT IS THAT WE WILL. RECEIVE THOSE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS. AND YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE EXPENDING THE FUNDS BUT FROM A YOU'D WE DON'T DO A CLAIM BY CLAIM KIND OF AUDIT. OF EACH OF THOSE AND COUNTLESS OVER THE REVENUE AND. REPORTS IF WE CAN CHECK IS THAT THE REPORT THAT'S ON PAGE. MAKE SURE I GET ENOUGH TENDO. THIRTEEN OF OUR HAND OUT. NO THE SERVICE SO THERE'S. SO BET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT ALLOCATE A SIGNIFICANT MOST OF THE FUNDING GOES TO THE COUNTIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THERE IS A STATE ADMIN COMPONENT OF AN HSA SO WE THE DEPARTMENT RECEIVE. SOME OF THOSE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS THAT OVERSIGHT COMMISSION RECEIVES THE BULK OF THEM BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT RECEIVE THEM MILITARY CDC ARE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW. I THINK THERE'S FIFTEEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT DOLLARS EITHER FOR PROGRAMMATIC. FUNCTIONS OR FOR THEIR ROLE IN. EITHER OVERSEEN OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTERING FUNDS UP WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THIS THOUGH I'M SEEING JANUARY OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS THERE AND JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. REPORT THAT'S DUE THERE IS A REPORT THAT WE ARE HOPING TO FINALIZE AND GET OUT CONSISTENT. IF I'M NOT SURE FOR TRYING TO GET OUT BEFORE OR IN LINE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION. THE REPORT WAS CERTAINLY DELAYED THIS YEAR WHEN WE. WERE TRYING TO GET IT RELEASE WITH THE GENERAL BUDGET THERE WAS. SOME DELAYS IN CERTAIN PIECES OF THE REPORT SO I'M WE GET DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA FROM DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND SO THAT JUST DELAYED THE OVERALL COMPILATION OF THE REPORT BUT WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE THAT FINALLY SHORTLY IMMINENT PASS IT OFF YOU KNOW. I'M SURE YOU CAN SENSE THE FRUSTRATION FROM OUR INABILITY TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF STATE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS. IF WE DON'T HAVE CURRENT DATA THAT IS BEFORE US AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO INVOLVE THE PUBLIC. AND TO HEAR THE TESTIMONY THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THESE TYPES OF CHANGES IN SUCH A SHORT WINDOW AND SO I BELIEVE THAT'S WHY WE HAD ESTABLISHED THE DATES FOR DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. AND THIS REPORTS TO BE IN JANUARY SO THAT WE IS A LEGISLATURE COULD. PROVIDE THAT MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT BUT WHAT WOULD MAKE THINGS SIMPLER IT YES OF WE MAY I THINK. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND. OUR TIMING INTO YOURS. BUT MY QUESTION IS THAT I REMEMBER FROM LAST YEAR THEY WERE DELAYED OUT AS WELL. SO IS THIS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE THAT THE REPORTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AVAILABLE ON TIME. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE REPORT WAS THAT DELAYED LAST YEAR I WAS DELAYED LAST YEAR I THINK THAT WAS MY FIRST JOB EXPERIENCE WITH THE OVERSIGHT. YET SO HOME I THINK IT'S JUST HARD BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET INFORMATION FROM SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS IN THAT HAVE A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH VICTIMS ON THE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT ACCURATE IN THAT WE COMPILE IT. SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT OF SOME FORWARD ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO MY INTO IT AND I AM TRUMP I'M A WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT O. OVER ANOTHER COMMITTEE AND THE. THE COME. THE COMPLAINT WAS THE SAME ABOUT THE REPORTING AND WHO CREATES THE REPORTING. WHO FOR CREATES THE THE METHOD OF RAPPER OF REPORT A WEEK CREATED AND WE HAVE BEEN REFINING A TEMPLATE THAT WE SEND OUT TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND THEN MURDERED SO THAT'S HOW MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT WE CREATE? THE REPORTING AND YET WE COMPLAIN THAT BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS SO COMPLICATED AND WE CREATE PROCESS. YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING SO YOU'RE ASKING THESE ENTITIES TO REPORT. IN X. WAY RIGHT. BUT I JUST HAVE TO TELL US WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE FUNDS AND SO I AM OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GET A TEMPLATE THAT'S WHAT WE JUST DEVELOPED. TO TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR COUNT UP FOR THE SLOT THE DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO POP IN THE THE INFORMATION OF ANY O THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO DO A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH THERE'S MORE OF A STANDARD TEMPLATE SO THAT WE CAN JUST. GET THE INFORMATION FROM THEM THAT WE NEED AND THEN IT MORE EASILY FITS INTO THAT TO THE FORMAT BUT THIS IS THE CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST YEAR IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME CONVERSATION WE HAD LAST YEAR ABOUT THE REPORTS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO. TO STREAMLINE THE REPORT PARTING PROCESS. ECCENTRIC THAT ARE ACCEPT US ALL THIS IS THE SECOND CONVERSATION AND IN TWO YEARS THAT WE'VE HAD OUR LAST YEAR IN THE SAME YEAR ABOUT IT SOLD DO YOU EXPECT. OR CAN I ASK WHEN DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE FINISHED AND WHEN. IS AGAIN BE FINISHED SO THAT NEXT YEAR WE WON'T HAVE THIS. SEE MISSION. WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT SOME FINAL EDITS THAT WE YEAR HOPING TO GET APPROVED AND FINALLY AS I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISIONS ARE PROBABLY IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. AND SO YES I MEAN WE HAVE. ALSO CHANGE THE DEADLINES BY WHICH OTHER DEPARTMENTS HAVE TO GET US INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN COMPILERS SOONER AN EFFORT TO MAKE IT. TIMELY WITH CONSISTENT WITH THE RELEASE OF THE GOVERNOR'S THEN THEN THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION THEN IS HOW ARE WE REPORTING THIS INFORMATION IF IT STATE IF IT TAKES TOO LONG. I YOU KNOW THE ONLY REFERENCE I HAVE IS TO WRITE MY TEACHING AND WE HAVE ONLINE OUR REPORT CARD SO WHEN I HAVE TO SUBMIT REPORT CARDS. AYE EACH TEACHER GETS ON THE SAME. SYSTEM WE ALL DO OUR REPORT CARDS WE HAVE A DEADLINE AND BY THAT DATE. EVERYTHING'S COMPILED SO THAT ONE PERSON IN THIS CASE THE PRINCIPLE HAS ALL OF THE THE REPORTS HOW ARE THESE ALL MANUAL ARE THESE ALL. OF. THEIR DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS REPORTING ON WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE FARMS AND SO SOME OF THEM WILL SAY OH WELL YOU KNOW. WE WERE WAITING FOR THIS ADDITIONAL PIECE OF INFORMATION TO COME IN SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS TO YOU AND THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE MORE IN MOST UPDATED INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE YOU FOR THIS YEAR'S UPDATE. AND SO WON'T WILL SET ME OFF MY BACK AND FORTH NEGOTIATION TRYING TO GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THEM I FUTURE SAW IN HIM AND HE DIDN'T KNOW THAT YEAH AND DROPPED IT YEAH IN TEACHING THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION ON REPORT CARDS. UP THE REPORT ARE TO ARGUE ON THAT DAY. AND I HAVE TO HAVE ALL MY DATA CORRECT I HAVE TO HAVE ALL MY ASSESSMENTS DONE SO THAT I WHEN I GET ONLINE AND REPORT THERE IS NO NEGOTIATION ABOUT WHAT EVERYONE CAN. THE TWINS FROM READ IT FROM ME FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR STAFF IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TIME FRAMES ARE THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S ARE GONNA HAVE TO SUBMIT INFORMATION TO US BY WHEN WILL HAPPILY SHARE THE TEMPLATE. AND THEN WILL BE TRACKING TO THAT. FOR DEVELOPMENT AND RELEASE CONCERT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EDUCATE AND SO WHEN CAN I EXPECT THAT. REMEMBER NEGOTIATION ON THE DATE IF YOU GIVE ME A DATE THAT'S WHEN I EXPECT THE DATE THE INFORMATION TO BE TURNED. I MEAN WE CAN SIMPLY YEAH IF CAN GIVE IT TO IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. OKAY SO BY THE END OF APRIL. OFF BETTER YET I'LL FIND YOU A DATE LIKE I GUESS. I JUST WONDER IS THERE. HOW TO PUT TEETH IN? THIS COULD GET ME NO PUN INTENDED OBVIOUSLY BUT. OF HOW HE PUT HAD HOW DO YOU PUT TEETH INTO GET. YOUR OWN STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO ACTUALLY DO THIS I MEAN WHY WHY IS IT WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT AGUIAR CURRY DEBATE. I DON'T AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT WHERE YOU KNOW I THINK. MINUTES A COUPLE THINGS THAT'S SOMETHING ELSE I THINK. WE DON'T NEED. NECESSARILY ANY KIND OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY WE'D YOU KNOW IT'S MORE ABOUT CONSISTENT. BOTH FEEDBACK AND JUST GOOD PERSONAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS RIGHT THEN WE HAVE STAFF AND OUR DEPARTMENT THAT HAVE. LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND THEY KNOW WHO TO CALL AND SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A MATTER OF DISPUTE OF PICKING UP THE PHONE OR. YOU KNOW SETTING UP A MEETING TO SAY WHAT ARE YOU STRUGGLING WITH TO GET. CAN WE UNDERSTAND WHY. AND SO I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF TIMES I AM WE ALL ARE WORKING INTO GETTING THIS INFORMATION AND SO IT WORKS THE OTHER WAY AS WELL. YOU SAY YOU DON'T NEED IT BUT IF WE DON'T GET THE INFORMATION IN THE QUICK ENOUGH TIMELY FASHION THEN WORK WERE FORCED TO PUT IT IN STATUTES SOME SOME WAY SOMEHOW. SO THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION AND THEN THERE'S THIS BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHY YOU SHOULD AND WHY YOU SHOULD AND AND ALL OF THAT AND SOUL. SO I'M AGAIN THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING THE RESPONSES THAT WE WE ARE ASKING AND AGAIN. FOR US AND AS A DOCTOR ARAMBULA STATED IS HOW DO WE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT WHEN WE'RE NOT GETTING THE DATA AND SO IT'S STARTING TO FEEL AND YOU KNOW AND I'M NOT I'M PUTTING IT OUT THERE. IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THESE ARE STALLED TYPE TACTICS JUST SO THAT THERE IS NO OVERSIGHT AND I WHEN WHEN THAT FEELING. A INCREASES THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE GONNA STATUTORY. REQUIREMENTS OR AT LEAST IN OUR PART ATTEMPTING TO GET THE INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S NOT BEING PROVIDED THE THE YOU KNOW COLLABORATIVE WAY RIGHT AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR FRUSTRATION AND. CERTAINLY APOLOGIZE FOR THAT AND WE WILL. GET THAT INFORMATION TO YOU ON THE TWENTY THIRD AND THEN. IF WE CAN RELEASE THE REPORT AT THE SAME TIME THAT WOULD BE. GOOD AS WELL. SO MAYBE I'LL JUST TAKE A STEP BACK BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING INTO THE WEEDS AND COMPARING A LITTLE BIT OF APPLES AND ORANGES HERE AND WANT TO MAKE SURE I. GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT IS OUR APPROPRIATE FISCAL OVERSIGHT AS A STATE WHAT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THESE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT EFFECT? GREAT SO. AND I WILL CERTAINLY. ALSO ASK FOR BOTH THE COMMISSION AND. COUNTIES TO CHIME IN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SHARING. AND IT WAS INCLUDED IN YOUR REPORT. THE FILING OF THE ARE YOU ARE SO THEY REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE REPORTS BY COUNTY WHEN THEY WERE SUBMITTED WHEN THEY WERE FINALIZED. ON IN SOME CASES THAT WAS. IT YEAH OUR WEIGHT BOTH PROVIDE SOME GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND WHICH COUNTIES HAD BEEN EITHER PROVIDING ARE NOT PROVIDING THE REPORTS WE CERTAINLY. CAN ALSO APPRECIATE. AS. AS BOTH TOBY AND AKERSON SAID. THE COUNTIES HAVE THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THESE. REVENUES AND SO SOMETIMES I THINK THERE'S. A HESITANCY TO. LEAP TOOK CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS LIKE AL YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE RESERVES AND YOU HAVEN'T USED THEM WHEN THEY HAVE ACTUALLY THREE YEARS TO USE THOSE FUNDS AND SO I THINK. WE ALSO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE PROVIDE DATA. EITHER TO YOU OR POST THE REPORTS ONLINE THAT PEOPLE CAN APPRECIATE THAT THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE TO USE THEM IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS OR THEY CAN BE USING THEM FOR LONGER TERM INITIATIVES. BUT I THINK. SO PART OF IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THE. ARE YOURS HAVE BEEN FILED BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WORK WITH. THERE'S AYE OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT WORKS WITH THE COUNTIES TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT AREAS WHERE THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO USE THE FUNDS ARE LARGELY CONTAINED TO THE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION AND. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDS AS WELL AS INNOVATION FUNDS SUCH A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE LARGER ON EMERGENCY ALLOCATION. I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE THOUGHTS AS TO WHY THOSE FUNDS ARE EITHER HARDER TO SPEND OR WHY AND THEY HAVE BEEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE COUNTIES TO SPEND AND SO I THINK. YOU'LL HEAR FROM US A LOT OF INTEREST IN WORKING CLOSELY WITH AND COUNTIES TO HELP. EITHER THINK OF IDEAS AROUND HOW THAT. MONEY CAN BE SPENT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT IT IS AS. TOBY SAID DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE IN THE INTENT OF THE INITIATIVE WHICH WAS IT WAS A LOCALLY BASED LOCALLY DESIGNED USE OF THOSE FUNDS TO BEST TARGET. NEEDS AND LOCAL AREAS AND SO YOU KNOW I'LL DEFER IF THERE'S OTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT. MY UNDERSTANDING TO OBVIOUSLY YOUR PREVIOUS TESTIMONY WHERE THERE WERE FIVE CORE METRICS THAT WERE NEEDING TO BE. FOLLOWED AND I'M WONDERING IF WE HAVE ANY DATA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO SHOW US HOW WE ARE AS A STATE OR DO. M. CAN I COMMENT ON THE FISCAL OVERSIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU. YOU KNOW THE THE COMMISSION EXISTS AS A COMPONENT OF THE MEN HOW SERVICES ACT AND I THINK THERE'S SAID. AND WHEN THE PUBLIC AUTHORIZES A TAX INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT PROP FIFTY THREE WAS DONE TO AN INITIATIVE. THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE WELL SPENT AND AND SO YOU KNOW PART OF THE REASON WHY IT IF YOU SORT OF YOU KNOW TALK TO CONSULTANT TO THIS WORK. PART OF THE REASON WHY WHEN YOU PUT IT A BALLOT MEASURE OUT THERE FOR TAX INCREASE THAT THEY INCLUDE AN ENTITY LIKE THIS. IS BECAUSE THERE'S. PEOPLE ARE ARE TRUSTING THAT THE MONEY THAT IS RAISED RIGHT. WILL WILL GO TOWARDS THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE AGREEING TO TAX THEMSELVES RIGHT THAT'S REALLY WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING. THAT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN PEOPLE ARE SAYING ADDITIONAL MONEY COMING IN BUT IT BUT NEEDS NOT BEING MET PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION RIDE AND AND THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT. BETWEEN PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE FISCAL REALITY OF GROWTH IN SPENDING. AND INCREASES AN UNMET NEEDS AND SO I THINK THAT. THE STATE HAS LONG HAD A AN OVERSIGHT ROLE EVEN UNDER REALIGNMENT NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT CAME WITH A COMMITMENT FOR THE STATE TO DEVELOP PERFORMANCE METRICS. RIGHT AND SO THERE WAS THIS ARRANGEMENT WHERE THE COUNTIES WOULD WOULD HAVE GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS THE DESIGN OF THEIR SYSTEM. IN EXCHANGE FOR A HIGHER LEVEL OF OUTCOME REPORTING AND I THINK WE'VE STRUGGLED HISTORICALLY IT'S NOT EASY TO DO. FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE RIGHT THERE HAS THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS OF ATTEMPTS AND IT IN INCLUDING LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAVE AUTHORED MISTER CHAIR. AND I THINK THAT THAT THE STATE HAS LONG HELD THIS ROLE WHEN THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IMAGES SAY DOLLARS ACCRUED IN THE STATE FUND. AND THE STATE ALLOCATED THEM BASED ON COUNTY PLANS AND AN OVERSIGHT WAS. YEAH SORT OF IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THAT PLAN REVIEW STAGE RIGHT. BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS SHIFT THAT TO DO OVERSIGHT IN TERMS OF. AND MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE UNDERSTANDING BUT ALSO THE OUTCOMES AND AND I WAS REFERENCING ANOTHER UNDER THAT PREVENTION INTERVENTION COMPONENT THERE ARE SEVEN NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE REDUCED AND SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING. TO A WE HAVE A VIDEO SCREEN WITH THE EIGHT CS WE HAVE A DATA YOU SCREW THE PARTNER JUSTICE WERE WORKING TO LINK THOSE DATA SETS SO WE CAN. TRACK AND INCARCERATION RATES ONE OF THE GOALS OF OF PREVENTION AND INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WHO WERE JAILED. THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE FOR IN OTHER PLACES FOR OVER A DECADE ITS NOT EASY TO DO THE DATA AT THE DOJ ISN'T ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT'S IT CAN BE HARD TO MATCH USING AND ABUSING PROBABILISTIC MATCHING. WE'RE WORKING TO DO THAT WITH CD BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE ACT IS TO IS TO USE MEN HOW STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SCHOOL FAILURE. THAT'S AN AREA THAT'S VERY CHALLENGING A WEEK WE'VE SEEN A LONG HISTORY OF OF COMPETITION BETWEEN COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS OVER SCARCE RESOURCES WHO PAYS SO TO SPEAK. AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH COMMISSION IS TRYING TO DO IS TO MEET THAT PUBLIC OBLIGATION. OF OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM WHERE IT'S GOING HOW IT'S BEING USED. AND WHAT THE PUBLIC IS GETTING FOR ITS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BANG FOR THE BUCK ARE YOU GETTING. THAT THE MORE DIFFICULT PIECE BUT THIS IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT PIECE IS TO THAN HELP YOU AS POLICY MAKERS AND HELP THE DEPARTMENT ALSO ON THE POLICY SIDE IN THE COUNTIES AS THE FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING SYSTEMS. TO UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF INVESTMENTS CAN CREATE IN TERMS OF HOW WE APPROACH DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND SO YOU KNOW YOU GOT IN YOUR PACKET SOME QUESTIONS PRESS ABOUT INNOVATION INCUBATOR OUTLET TO GET TO. BUT PART OF THAT WORK IS TO REALLY PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STRENGTHEN THAT OVERALL STRATEGY AROUND USING DATA TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE NOW WHERE WE NEED TO BE HEADED WHAT'S WORKING AND FOR WHOM AND THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS FOR CERTAIN PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T WORK FOR OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTS AND QUITE OFTEN THAT NO ONE GETS LOST IN THE SORT OF BROADER. HIGH LEVEL KIND OF ANNOUNCES BUT I THINK THE THE POINT IS WELL TAKEN MISTER CHAIR THAT THE STATE HAS AN ONGOING OBLIGATION. TO FOR A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE AROUND THE FUNDS I THINK WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS IN THAT AREA CLEARLY THE REPORTING IS IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT YOU CAN'T DO YOUR JOB WE CAN'T DO OUR JOB. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE. AND. AND QUITE WELL SAID A MEAN ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL FOR A STATE THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA NOR DO I THINK WORK TRYING TO. DICTATE TO REACH IN AND EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY WHAT. NEEDS THEY HAVE WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT. I THINK WE AS A STATE SHOULD SET UP SOME FRAMEWORK TO AT LEAST DESCRIBED. HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IS BEING KEPT IN RESERVES? AND SO MY NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS IF I CAN IS. WHAT IS A PRUDENT RESERVE IS THERE A CAP ON THE SIZE OF A RESERVE THAT A? COUNTY SHOULD BE HOLDING ON TO AND HOW DO YOU MAKE THOSE TYPES OF DETERMINATIONS. I KNOW THAT. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE AUDIT AND. IN THE FISCAL REGULATIONS THAT WERE. ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOP WITH OUR DEPARTMENT ANYWHERE ADDRESSING A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS I'M PRUDENT RESERVE AS WELL AS THE USE OF INTEREST SO IF YOU DO HAVE FUNDS AGAIN IF. IF YOU'RE ALLOWED THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS OBVIOUSLY INTEREST ACCRUES ON. ON THAT. I THINK WE'VE SAID THAT. WE KIND OF ARE SETTING IN THE REGULATIONS WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE A PRUDENT RESERVE AND UNDERSTANDING. COUNTY SOMETIMES HAVE THESE RESERVES BECAUSE AS WE ARE SETTLING NOW AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'LL I'LL GET BACK TO THIS BRAIDED FUNDING. IS WHEN WE'RE IN. AND A COUNTY AND WE'RE DOING AT COSTS RECONCILIATION ON THEIR EXPENDITURES FOR MEDI CAL AND WE WILL LOOK AT A CLAIM AND SAY. THAT WAS AN ALLOWABLE EXPENDITURE FOR MEDI CAL FUNDING THE COUNTY CAN. CANCEL THAT CLAIM WITH US AND HAY THAT WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING AND SO SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT THE RESERVE IS USE FOR TO KNOW THAT THE COUNTIES OF CERTAINLY. WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ENOUGH FUNDS THAT WHEN WE GO BACK AND DO THOSE COSTS RECONCILIATIONS THAT THEY HAVE THAT IN PLACE AND SO. THE REGULATIONS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THERE'S A. THERE WILL BE VERY CLEAR KIND OF PERCENTAGES OF WHAT WE EXPECT COUNTIES TO HAVE TO HOLD ITS PRUDENT RESERVES AND ANYTHING AFTER THAT WOULD BE DEEMED TO PROBABLY ACCESS. WE'RE GONNA RUBIO YES JUST. HOW MUCH OF A COOK SO WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT PERCENTAGES HOW MUCH MONEY IS? GIVEN TO COUNTIES HOW MUCH MORE MONEY DO WE HAVE IN RESERVE AND. YEAH LET'S START WITH THOSE. SO LAST YEAR CHRIS COOK A FINANCE A LAST YEAR THERE'S APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED THE COUNTIES. FOR THE. SURE OKAY FOR ITS OIL WOULD THAT BE CAN I ASSUME THAT THAT WAS EVERY YEAR. THAT THE PHENOMENA REVENUE HAS BEEN INCREASING. ANYWHERE HELPS UP YEAH I DON'T HAVE THE HIGHEST OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS YEAH OK YEAHIT'S IT'S PEGGED TO CAPITAL GAINS. SO DEPENDING ON HOW WELL OUR ECONOMY IS DOING THAT TAX REVENUE FLUCTUATES GREATLY. I'M SO THEN THERE'S A METHODOLOGY THAT. FINANCE WORKS THROUGH AND EACH COUNTY GETS A CERTAIN ALLOCATION AND THEN IT'S BUCKET INTO THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THAT P. AND I WHICH IS THE. PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION INNOVATION FUNDS AND THEN THEY'RE GIVEN THREE YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS AND SO EACH COUNTY HAS ITS OWN. EITHER RESERVE OR THERE ARE FUNDS THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE COUNTY ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO PERVERSION WHICH IS THE OTHER HIGH POINT OF THE AUDIT WHICH WAS HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN SITTING ON THOSE FUNDS OR HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE AN RETURNS. I THINK WE HAVE. AB ONE FOURTEEN AND THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE HAD HAD APPROXIMATE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION THAT WAS SUBJECT TO REVERSION. I'M NOT TO RIVERS AND. I'M TALKING ABOUT RESERVES LITTLE SO. STRUCTURE CAN SAYS IT'S YOU KNOW UP UNTIL LAST YEAR LAST YEAR THERE WAS A RIVER OR A CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR SMALL COUNTIES BUT GENERALLY IT'S THREE YEARS TO USE THE MONEY I LISTEN. FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I WAS NOT PART OF THE FOLKS ATTRACTED THIS BUT CLEARLY WAS HELP MAKE THE CASE FOR THAT AND THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL REVENUES. THE IDEA WAS THAT IT COUNTIES MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEND ALL THE MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR REMEMBER SOME OF THE MONEY COMES IN IN THE ELEVENTH MONTH. OR THE TWELFTH MONTH OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND SO THERE'S A AND UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MAY NOT BILL TO SPEND YOUR ENTIRE APRIL PAYCHECK BY THE END OF APRIL. SO SOME OF THAT YOU SPEND IN MAY OR JUNE. BUT THE THE IDEA WAS NOT THAT YOU COULD SIT ON THE MONEY FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND THEN ONLY BEGIN TO USE IT IN THE THIRD YEAR. WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT A SAMPLE OF COUNTIES WE SEE SOME COUNTIES WELL TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE TO PRESERVE PEACE. SO THE COUNTIES ARE ALLOWED TO PUT FUNDS INTO A PRUDENT RESERVE TO RAINY DAY FUND A LOCK BOX THE MONEY GOES THERE. AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SHIFT UP TO TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR OF US WHAT'S CALLED A CSS COMPONENT INTO THAT PRETTY RESERVE IF THEY DO THAT IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO REVERSION. IT REALLY IS A RAINY DAY FUND AND IT'S IN A LOCK BOX WERE IN AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES ESTABLISHES PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH THIS FUND CAN BE ACCESSED OKAY NOW ARMED MAN IF I CAN FIND ME. SO TWENTY PERCENT BUT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO KEEP THE MONEY FOR. FOR THREE YEARS SO I'M ASSUMING TWENTY PERCENT WERE YOUR ONE TWENTY PRESENT YOUR TWO OR TOTAL TWENTY PERCENT FOR THE THREE YEAR EACH YEAR EACH SONG. OKAY BUT WHILE THAT'S RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S THERE'S THE FLEXIBILITY FOR COUNTIES THAT THAT CAN SHIFT THERE'S ACTUALLY A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN SHIFT OUR RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SHIFT ANY BUT IF THEY WANT TO PUT INTO A RAINY DAY FUND. FOR DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY THAT'S FOR THE PRINT RESERVES FOR THE RIVERS AND RULES DON'T APPLY TO RIGHT NOW SO I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT JUST SO THAT THAT SO THAT I'M CLEAR ON ON THE TWENTY PERCENT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE. RIVERS AND. MONEY I'M ASKING ABOUT THE RAINY DAY SOUL. IN THREE YEARS LET'S ASSUME AND I'M JUST IN GENERAL LET'S USE THE BILLION DOLLARS. AS AS A AS A BANE RESERVE OR THERE'S HIGH HIGH LEVEL OF VARIATION IT'S THE OTHER THE OTHER RESERVE THAT YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT OF THE FUNDS THAT AREN'T IN THE PRUDENT RESERVE THAT JUST AREN'T BEING SPENT. THEY'RE BEING HELD FOR CASH FLOW PURPOSES OVER THAT THREE YEAR PERIOD AND AND SO WE WE SEE VARIATION OF SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE KEEPING MAYBE SIX MONTHS OF CASH ON HAND. IT REALLY IS CHECKS ARE COMING IN AND CHECKS ARE GOING OUT IN THE SKY KEEPING AT A RUNNING BALANCE HERE WE SEE OTHER COUNTIES. THAT ARE SITTING ON TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF REVENUES IN THEIR ONLY BEGINNING TO SPEND IT IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE THIRD YEAR. THAT'S NOT THE PRUDENT RESERVE RIGHT THAT'S IN THE MEANTIME IT IT ISN'T THERE A NEED. RIGHT I WAS OUT IN THE EARLY AND IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL THAT'S THE PART YEAH PARTICULARLY IN PARTICULAR SUDDEN COMMUNITIES WHO ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE AS THEY LOOK AT PROJECTIONS AND I KNOW. THE ISSUE OF RAINY DAY FUND IS CONTROVERSIAL EVEN IN THIS BUILDING ABOUT WHETHER WE SPEND WHEN WE HAVE THE REVENUES OR WHETHER WE TAKE A LONG RANGE. PLANNING APPROACH IN PHILIP THE PIGGY BANK I THINK THAT KIND OF CONVERSATION DOES HAPPEN IN EACH COUNTY ABOUT HOW CONSERVATIVES ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE. HOWEVER I THINK THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE DO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT HAS REGULATIONS UNDER WAY THIS VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS ABOUT WHAT WHAT DOES NOT TO INCLUDE BUT. RATHER THAN LOOK AT THE IDEA OF A RESERVE FOR A RAINY DAY NEEDING TO REACH. AT LEAST A CERTAIN LEVEL WE ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE FLIPPED AND IN FACT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A MAXIMUM FIVE AMOUNT OF A PRUDENT RESERVE SO THAT IN FACT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. YEAR YOU'RE PROHIBITED REALLY FROM ACCUMULATING MORE REVENUES THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN YOUR OPERATION SAY FOR SIX MONTHS. AND THAT THAT WE WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF SOMETHING THAT WOULD PLACE SEVEN POUND CEILING RATHER THAN A FLOOR. AT YOUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMMING AND HAVE YOU KNOW THAT CRITICAL SERVICES CONTINUE IF THERE IS OF A DIP IN THE REVENUE IN THERE ARE IN FACT VERY VOLATILE YEARS I THINK FINANCE COULD ATTEST TO THIS THERE HAVE BEEN YEARS IN WHICH. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE HAS STEPPED TO HIS MUCH AS THIRTY NINE PERCENT BELOW WHAT IT WAS THE PRIOR YEAR SO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SCARE. GOVERNMENT AND AND WE DO WANT TO BE PREPARED FOR THOSE THINGS BUT WE DO FULLY AGREE THAT. THERE NEEDS TO BE THE ABILITY TO ANSWER TO LOCAL. SITUATIONS WHERE PERHAPS REVENUES IN OTHER AREAS DROPS OR YOUR COMMUNITY EXTREMELY IMPACTED BY HOMELESS BUT EVEN USING YOUR EXAMPLE OF A THIRTY NINE PERCENT DECREASE WHICH WAS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WE'VE SEEN IN ANY ONE YEAR. THAT DOESN'T EXPLAIN HOLDING TWO AND A HALF YEARS WORTH OF FUNDS. IN RESERVE WHEN THERE IS AS MUCH NEED AS WE HAVE AND WE WOULD AGREE WITH THAT AND SO WE WE AGREE THERE IS A NEED FOR A STATEWIDE STANDARD. THAT CLARIFIES WHAT THE PURPOSE OF A RESERVIST BECAUSE THE ACT ACTUALLY HAS THREE DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE RESERVISTS FLOOR AND WHEN YOU CAN USE IT WE NEED TO CLEAN THOSE THINGS THAT. WE ALSO NEED TO CLARIFY REALLY WHAT'S REASONABLE WHAT CAN PASS THE SMELL TEST BETWEEN WE WANT TO HAVE LONG RANGE PLANNING WE DON'T WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER CRITICAL SERVICES. HOWEVER AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO A MASS DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED FOR VERY CRITICAL NEED MY PROBLEM WITH THIS IS WHERE THE MENTAL HEALTH. A. ISSUES IS IN THAT UP A CRISIS MODE IT'S NOT LIKE OH YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE HERE IT'S. SO WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR HANDS AT SOME POINT WHERE DOES LIKE A REGULAR PERSON SATAN YOU KNOW WHAT. YES I A LONG TERM PLANNING BUT LOOK AT THE CRISIS WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE ORANGE COUNTY WHERE I AM IN MY COUNTY WHERE WE'RE HAVING A CRISIS OF MENTAL HEALTH. A. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO CALL IT OF OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AT WHAT POINT DOES A REGULAR PERSON GOAL. I GET ALL OF THAT BUT LOOK AT THE CRISIS AND LET'S. TRY TO. I'M FRUSTRATED I'M FRUSTRATED BECAUSE IT'S NOT CARS THAT WERE BUILDING IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT WERE PLAYING WITH AND AND IF WE'RE NOT PUTTING THAT MONEY IN THOSE SERVICES WERE AFFECTING NOT JUST THAT PERSON'S LIFE BUT THEIR FAMILIES. BUT COUNTIES THE CITIES AND WE SIT BACK AND GOAL PULL MY GOT BACK CRISIS OF THAT HAPPENING IN ORANGE COUNTY POOR PEOPLE BY YEAR WERE SITTING ON. A OF MONEY THAT COULD BE USED FOR THAT FOR THAT AND I THINK IT'S IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO REALLY THINK THROUGH THE DIFFERENCES AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S EASY. WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE OF NEWS STORIES TALK ABOUT COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON MONEY I THINK WERE WE TO LOOK AT OUR OWN STATE BUDGET YOU COULD WRITE THE SAME HEADLINE IF WE WANTED TO YOU KNOW PICK APART THE VALIDITY OF HAVING A RAINY DAY FUND. THAT WERE SITTING ON MONEY AND YET WE HAVE NEEDS IN OUR STATE I THINK WE DO NEED TO DEFINITELY CLEAR UP WHAT A REASONABLE PRINT RESERVE WOULD BE. WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE ONE ABOUT AYE NOT JUST OUR LITTLE BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE RESERVE YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S TO DO RIGHT SHUT THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE COUNTIES WITH THIS UNSPENT MONEY I THINK I. TOBY MENTIONED. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WERE KIND OF PILED UP BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENT A MENTAL HEALTH FOLLOWED BY D. H. CS DID NOT. ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT STATUTE WHICH WAS THAT TO THE EXTENT COUNTIES COULDN'T SPEND TIMELY THOSE DOLLARS WOULD GET REVERTED THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. SO LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ON IN COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES AND OTHERS WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A ONE TIME MECHANISM TO LOOK HERE INVEST THOSE GOD IS IN THAT WERE WET. WE GET UP WITH IT HE LEARN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING THAT PEACE AND HOPEFULLY GOING FORWARD WE DON'T WIND UP HAVING THE SAME CONVERSATION AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE OASES CHO TO FINISH ITS WORK THAT IT STARTED A YEAR SO AGO. I'M TO LOOK AT THE INNOVATION GUIDELINES THOSE JUST GOT PUBLISHED IN REGULATION. IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SO WE'VE HAD JUST NOW A NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT AND PUT PROGRAMS FOURTH TO THE OAC TO HAVE THOSE INNOVATION DOLLARS CAN EXPAND IT SO. I THINK WERE WERE HOPING THAT ON THE AUDIT IN THE FIRE THAT'S BEEN PLACED UNDERNEATH. DOT ONLY THE STATE AGENCIES BUT CERTAINLY THE COUNTIES AROUND THESE ISSUES THAT WE ARE PUTTING SOMETHING SOMEPLACE AND SEE PHD HAVE SOME SPECIFIC IDEAS THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL. AND WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR ALMOST AN HOUR SOIL I'LL STOP ON THE ISSUE SHORTLY BUT JUST A FEW MORE OVERVIEWS IF I CAN. DONE. QUESTION SIX I FOUND THEM POWERFUL ONES WONDERING DIRECTOR IF YOU COULD ANSWER IT SO. THE THAT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY TO. DEEM CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES. HAS D. H. CS RECEIVED ANY OF THESE NOTIFICATIONS AND WHAT HAVE WE DONE ABOUT HIM. SO. THAT AND WE HAVE HAD ONE. AND IT WAS INVOLVING AND COUNTY THAT HAD USED MHSAA FUNDS FOR A NON MHSAA PURPOSE. SO WHEN WE RECEIVE. ISSUES LIKE THAT WE GO TO THE COUNTY WE'D DO I WOULD. I'D. DON'T TAKE INVESTIGATION AS A KIND OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPE OF INVESTIGATION BUT. WE WOULD GO OUT TO THE COUNTY AND WE WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS ACTUALLY UNSUPPORTED BY. WHAT THEY HAD EXPENDED THE FUNDS ON AND THEN WE WORK WITH THEM TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO THAT? THEY HAVE TO THEN BACK OUT THE EITHER EXPENDITURE THEY HAVE TO PAY WITH DIFFERENT FUNDS ARE REPLACE THE FUNDS THAT THEY OTHERWISE USE BUT THERE'S ONLY BEEN ONE. COME LET ME THEN TRANSITION TO THE NEXT QUESTION. EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF. INTEREST. WHO WHAT'S THE PLAN WITH THAT WHAT'S OUR ROLE AS A STATE AND? WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO TRACK THAT SO WE CONSISTENT WITH THAT INFORMATION NOTICE THAT WESENT OUT TO THE COUNTIES WE HAVE TOLD THEM THAT THE INTEREST? IN WHICHEVER ACCOUNT THAT IT'S ACCRUING ON HOUSE TO BE SPENT CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD OTHERWISE BE YOU SO IF YOU'RE EARNING INTEREST ON YOUR. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION ALLOCATION THE INTEREST THAT ACCRUES TO THE HOUSE WE USE IN PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS INTEREST THAT IS. GARNERED ON THE INNOVATION FUNDS AND YOU HAVE TO USE IT FOR YOUR INNOVATION SO THAT WE ISSUED GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES AND LETTING THEM KNOW HOW TO HANDLE THAT INTERESTS. I'M I'M GONNA ASK A QUESTION THAT'S QUITE DETAILED AND I'M SORRY IF I LOSE ANYONE BUT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT AND I DON'T FULLY GET IT. SO IF. FISCAL YEAR ONE TWO THREE. COME FISCAL YEAR TWO YOU WANT TO CHANGE YOUR THREE YEAR PLAN TO MAKE IT TWO THREE FOUR. DO THE PERCENTAGES THAT YOU'VE SPENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AREA HAVE TO BE. ACCURATE. SO IF YOU HAD SPEND EIGHTY PERCENT ON COMMUNITY SERVICE AS AN TWENTY PERCENT ON INNOVATION ARE THOSE TRANSFERABLE. TO THE NEXT CONTRACTOR HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING TWENTY PERCENT ON EARLY INTERVENTION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE. WE KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ON ACTUALLY PREVENTING DISEASE. THAT THE POINT OF THIS IS THE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION AND THAT WE NEVER EFFECTIVELY SPEND THOSE DOLLARS. SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE SPENDING AT A MINIMUM TWENTY PERCENT AS DESIGNED IN STATUTE. AND SO I THINK THAT EASIEST WAY I ACCORDING TO. BRENDA IS ITS FIRST AND. FIRST OUT SO IF YOU GET ALLEN ALLOCATION AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SAY AND. TO MAKE MATH EASY LET'S SAY IT'S A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ACCOUNT. HALF A MILLION AND PNI AND HALF A MILLION INNOVATION THOSE NUMBERS ARE RIGHT BUT DISTRICT MAP. MENU EXPEND ALL OF YOUR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS YOU SPENT MILLION DOLLARS HE SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. A THOUSAND OF THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND PNI AND YOU SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN INNOVATION. AND YOU COME BACK AND SAY I WANT TO USE THOSE REMAINING TO AMOUNTS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND SERVICES. YOU CAN'T WRITE YOU CAN ROLL IT INTO THOSE ACCOUNTS FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND SOME COUNTIES MAY DO THAT RIGHT SO IF YOU GET ONLY. SOME CAN EASILY GET LIKE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INNOVATION FUNDS IN A SINGLE YEAR THE VERY SMALL IN YOU CAN DO A LOT WITHOUT AND SO THEY MAY SET ON INNOVATION FUNDS FOR. A COUPLE OF YEARS TO KIND OF BUILD UP AN AMOUNT AND THEN COME AND SAY TO THE COMMISSION WE'D LIKE TO USE. THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INNOVATION AND THIS IS HOW WE WOULD USE THAT. BUT YOU DON'T GET TO COME BACK AND RE ALLOCATE YOURSELF INTO IT A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T USE FUNDS. SO THEY STAYED PRETTY MUCH IN THAT ACCOUNT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED. SO IS THERE. CAN WE GET AN ANALYSIS OF. WHERE THEY ARE IN THOSE SPECIFIC POOLS OF MONEY THEN SO THAT WE CAN THEN ANALYZE? HOW TO HELP TO INCENTIVIZE APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING BY THE COUNTY SO THAT? THEY'RE SPENDING THE FUNDS HAS. INDICATED. DO YOU. YES SO I'M LOOKING AT EITHER FINANCE THEIR EACH COUNTY THAT HAS BALANCES. OUTSTANDING BALANCES AND. PNI AND INNOVATION BROKEN DOWN BY COUNTY IS THAT PART OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S NO CONCERN WHAT'S GOING OUT TO COUNTY THOUGH AND THEN WHAT WHEN THE CLOCK STARTS FOR. EACH OF THOSE FARMS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO SPEND THOSE MONIES WHICH AND WITHIN THE HOUR YEAH TIME FRAMES FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE AND THEY HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE COMPONENTS SO. YOU CAN'T SHIFT FROM ONE COMPONENT TO ANOTHER SO IT CAME INTO ONE COMPONENT THAT'S EVEN WITH AB ONE FOR TO. GET THREE ALLOCATED CERTAIN SO SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A VALUE I THINK THAT'S BEEN HELD ACROSS ON MHSAA IS TERRIFIC. IF SOMETHING GOES OUT ORIGINALLY IN A PARTICULAR COMPONENT IT STAYS IN THAT PROPONENTS. TOOK MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW YEAH IT JUST KIND OF. GOING UP WEBER ANNA ANNA SAID. SCREENSHOT I THINK THE PROBLEM WITH THE FACT THAT. WHERE'S OUR OVERSIGHT. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IF THE ONLY THING WE SEE IS MONEY GOING OUT OF OUR ACCOUNT AND NOT WE SEE THE FUNDS THAT ARE EXPENDED AFTER THE COUNTY HAS EXPANDED AND BECAUSE THEY FILE THOSE REPORTS WITH US SO I NOTHING ON RETIRED MAYBE EVERY YASHA AND THAT. SUMMER DELAY I'M AROUND. MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY IS SO YOU KNOW YOUR REFERENCE TO THE REFERRALS FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE DEPARTMENT. THE THAT'S THAT'S RECOGNIZING THAT THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE AUDIT CAPACITY OR AUTHORITY RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT HOWEVER SANTA. SO IT'S TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIES A CHALLENGE COUNTY THAT WAS SOMEWHAT HUMOROUS AND DISAPPOINTING. M. THAT THEM HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THERE THERE ARE LOTS OF FISCAL PRACTICES THAT NEED TO BE TIGHTENED UP IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE MONEY DISPENSED GOT INNOVATION. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL PROCESS I MEAN DEDICATED INNOVATION. THE PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK THAT. BOTH IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES BUT ALSO A PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT WHAT'S BEST TO BE SPENT ON. AT AND THEN PART OF THAT IS IS IT ACTUALLY IMPACTFUL. THAT'S YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR STRATEGY IN THE LIMITED AUTHORITY RESOURCES WE HAVE REALLY IS TO PUT THE REPORTS OF THE KINDS OF REPAIRING ONLINE LET PEOPLE SEE THEM. AND RELEASED TRIED TO SUPPORT THAT BROAD LEVEL OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEN TO DO THE DATA LINKING AND AND THE IDEA THERE. IS TO REALLY HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL WITH THE GOALS THAT ARTICULATED IN THE ACT. BUT BUT WE DO DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THE AUDITS IN THE REVIEWS BECAUSE THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. THAT WE FALL UNDER AND YOU'VE SEEN SORT OF THE CHALLENGE AROUND. THE COST REPORTS YOU KNOW IF THE AUDITOR IS TRIED TO. BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLICATED SYSTEM WHERE THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS THE IT IS COMPOSED OF FIT TOGETHER AS WELL IN THE VERY FIRST QUESTION ABOUT WHY AREN'T WE DOING A BETTER JOB INTEGRATING PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THE HOUSE. WITH ONE QUESTION THOUGH YOU SAID THAT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING THESE REPORTS ALL OF THAT INFORMATION ON LINES OF THE PUBLIC CAN SEE IS THERE ANYWHERE WHERE THE PUBLIC CAN SEE IT WHAT WHAT MONEY. IS IN RESERVES AND WHAT MANY. IS IS THE OUT GOING BACK TO REVERSION YASSER CURRENTLY ON OUR WEBSITE YOU CAN CLICK ON YOUR COUNTY AND YOU CAN SEE THE REVENUE LET'S SAY. IT'S W. BULGARIA MHS SO AC DOT CA DOT GOV IT'S A I WILL I WILL. TELL YOU WITH A BIT OF EMBARRASSMENT IT IS A STANDARD STATE WEBSITE THAT IS NOT VERY USER FRIENDLY. BUT I'M HAPPY TO SHOW YOU SEND YOU INTO THAT'S THE PROBLEM THOUGH AND I HEAR PEOPLE SOLELY ON IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU'RE SAYING ALL OF THESE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN THROUGH THE WEBSITE BUT THEN YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S NOT A GOOD WEBSITE SO THEN. THAT THE ACCOUNTABILITY NOT JUST FROM US BUT FROM THE PUBLIC IS NOT HAPPENING FOR USING THAT WERE DEPENDING ON THE PUBLIC TO TO DO THIS. IS ANYWAY I I THINK ARE AND WHAT HE SAID TO THOUGH IS THAT. THE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY IT LIES WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT THERE REALLY A GRAND JURY I LIKE THAT ANALOGY SORRY I THINK WE CUT YOU OFF PLEASE MISS PARLEY. DISCREDITED TO POINT OUT IT'S IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR COUNTIES TO HEAR THAT THE STATE FINDS IT CHALLENGING TO BE ABLE TO. TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE VOLUMES OF DATA AND NARRATIVE THAT ARE BEING REQUIRED TO BE PRODUCED BY COUNTY IS THEN SENT TO THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT. I AND I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT IT IS CHALLENGING BUT I THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO STOP BEING A GOOD ENOUGH ANSWER THE FACT THAT IT'S COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. AND THAT THAT EACH COUNTY IS SUBMITTING PILES OF INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY BASED ON WHAT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS TOLD THEM ARE THE NEEDS WITH DATA. IN THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THEY'RE PUTTING IN PLACE WITH PREVENTION WITH COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITH INNOVATION THE INFORMATION IS AT OUR FINGERTIPS IT'S THE LACK OF IT IS A. AGENCY AND TO TAKE ALL OF THAT AND THEN TURN THAT INTO SOMETHING THAT'S VALUABLE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO KNOW. HOW MUCH MONEY ARE COUNTY SPENDING AND ON WHAT TYPE OF THING BUT I THINK MORE VALUABLE WOULD BE TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE CHANGED IN OUR PEOPLE GETTING HEALTHIER? THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE ACT WAS INTENDED TO TRY TO GET VOTERS YOU KNOW WE WERE TELLING VOTERS THAT WE KNEW WHAT WORKED WE WERE BUILDING ON PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WE NEW WORKS AND WHY SHOULDN'T EVERY COMMUNITY HAVE THE OPTION TO DO THOSE THINGS. SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE A STATE AGENCY WHETHER IT'S THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONER THE DEPARTMENT. CONTRACT OUT WITH A THIRD ENTITY TO TAKE THESE CHALLENGING AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND TAKE OF THE VOLUMES OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEING COLLECTED AND TURN THAT INTO A STORY ABOUT THE OUTCOMES THAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING. SOMETHING CVH DAY WOULD VERY MUCH UNLIKE THE LEGISLATURE'S PARTNERSHIP IN LEADERSHIP AND THEN IT'S A TOPIC THAT WILL BE HEARD IN THE SENATE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE LATER THIS WEEK. CAN. WHAT WHAT METRICS WOULD THE COUNTY HIGHLIGHTED AS EFFECTIVE? EXAMPLES OF MONEY BEING WELL SPENT. I THINK AND I THINK ONE NEED ONLY READ THE ACT. THAT THAT WHILE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND SPECIAL TARGET POPULATIONS BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BEING IMPLEMENTED. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH EVERY COUNTY HAS BEEN EXPECTED TO. RES. YOU KNOW TO REALLY BE LOOKING AT CAN YOU TELL US THAT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED IS REDUCING INCARCERATIONS IS IMPROVING AND SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT FOR KIDS IS KEEPING OUT OF PEOPLE OUT OF HOSPITALS WHEN THERE'S THE SEVEN OR EIGHT OUTCOMES THAT ARE LISTED. THAT'S WHAT THE VOTER PAMPHLET SAID WE ALL SHOWED UP. TO THE ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND I THINK WE NEED TO START THEIR. HAVE WE AS A STATE COLLECTED THAT DATA AT ANY POINT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND HOW ARE WE TREND. WELL I THINK THIS IS. PART OF THE CONVERSATION FOR LATER IN THE AGENDA IN TERMS OF THE DEPARTMENTS. DEVELOPMENT AND MATURITY AROUND A PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM IT IS NOT AND SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON MHSAA. SO IT GETS BACK TO KIND OF MY INITIAL COMMENTS AROUND. MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY IN CALIFORNIA USING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AND SO WE HAVE. METRICS THAT WE ARE BUILDING AND DEVELOPING AS AND WE TRY TO MEASURE OUTCOMES AS A STATE AND MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR WHAT WE OVERSEE AND. BUT THAT'S A THAT'S SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THAN WHAT YOU WERE ASKING AS IT PERTAINS TO AN AGE OF SAY. WE DIDN'T OF THE DC ARE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT IT STANDS FOR. WHICH BRENDA. CAN SPEAK VERY ADEPTLY AT I'M SURE. FOR AS A DATA PERSON WHICH WAS COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR COMPONENT THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS A A VERY BIG PART OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT COUNTIES ARE MAKING. BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE SEEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT BE ABLE TO TAKE THESE KINDS OF COMPLEX THINGS AND LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE PREVENTION. AND BE ABLE TO TELL US IN FACT ARE THOSE INVESTMENTS COST YOU KNOW THEIR COST BENEFIT. AND NOT JUST CAN BE TRACED WHICH DOLLAR WENT TO WHICH PROGRAM BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY AGAIN DID THE DOLLAR INVESTED GET TO THE OUTCOMES THAT VOTERS EXPECTED. AND I GUESS THAT'S THE. POINT I KEEP TRYING TO DRIVE FOR AND I'M LOOKING FOR AN OUTCOME WE CAN HANG OUR HAT ON. FOR THE INCREASE IN COVERAGE AS WELL AS THE INCREASE IN SPENDING. WHAT CAN WE SHOW DEFINITIVELY AFTER YEARS OF INVESTMENTS? THAT HAVE MADE MEANINGFUL IMPACT FOLD DIFFERENCE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR BUT I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANYONE HERE. THAT THERE'S A DEMONSTRATE A BOWL. IMPROVEMENT POST MONEY BEING SPENT ON SO I ASK AGAIN DO WE HAVE THE APPROACH APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. OVER THE SPENDING THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY AYE I DO KNOW THAT BECAUSE IT'S REQUIRED OF EVERY COUNTY TO ADDRESS EVALUATION OUTCOMES THAT EVERY COUNTY. IS LOOKING AT THE OUTCOMES THEY'RE PRODUCING THAT GETS REPORTED IN PART OF HOW THEY THE. SO TO RATIONALIZE THEIR THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE THIS IT WORKS WE'VE THEREFORE ARE EXPANDING INTO CONTINUING IT SO WE KNOW THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE IS ROBUST INFORMATION JUST I THINK I'M A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ONE OF OUR COUNTIES WAS HERE BRIEFING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION ON A RECENT RAND REPORT THAT LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT ITS MHSAA EVALUATIONS NOW COMES. RAND HAS ALSO EVALUATED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS AND PREVENTION DOLLARS THAT THE COUNTY'S JOINTLY ADMINISTERED TO REDUCE SUICIDE IN REDUCED EGGMAN DISCRIMINATION IS ARE THINGS THAT WERE ABLE TO SHOW WORK. BUT AS TO TO THE MANY OTHER DOLLARS. BEING EXPENDED STATEWIDE I THINK WE REALLY IT IS MORE THAN TIME. FOR ONE UNIFIED APPROACH TO BEING ABLE TO EVALUATE THE OUTCOMES AND THE OTHER GOOD NEWS SAYS THE ACT ACTUALLY CONTEMPLATED THIS. IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATION ARENA IN THE ACT. ONE OF THE VERY SPECIFIED PURPOSES OF OF THAT UP TO FIVE PERCENT BE SET ASIDE FOR IS TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE EVALUATION THE OUTCOMES OCCUR. SO IT'S NOT EVEN FOR LACK OF A FUNDING SOURCE SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT SEGUE IN THIS WILL BE THE LAST ROUND OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE WE PROGRESS. IS REGARDING. STATE ADMINISTRATION SO MY UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS MONEY IN STATE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS AS WELL CAN WE GET IT. A BASIS FOR HOW MUCH EXTRA STATE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS WE HAVE. RIGHT SO AS NOTED ON PAGE FIFTEEN AND NAY AGENDA THERE'S A CHART. THAT REFLECTS THE STATE ADMINISTRATIVE A. ADMIN CAP FILE A CHART THAT WE REFER TO AS ADMIN CAP. SO IN THAT. YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THE VERY BOTTOM THAT THAT THERE'S APPROXIMATELY SIXTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION THAT'S AVAILABLE. IN ACCESS FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED TO. FROM THE MHS F.. ALTHOUGH ALL KNOW THAT. THE PRIMARY. IT THAT. WHEN LOOKING AT THIS BALLOTS THIS ISN'T CONSIDERED A WAH ONGOING AMOUNT THAT CAN BE SPENT A RATHER WE VIEWED THE ADMINISTRATION VIEWS AS A ONE TIME. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENDITURES. THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING IN OUR ONGOING EXPENSES BEING OBLIGATED ARE EXCEEDING. THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO BE RECEIVED AND SO THE REASON THAT THERE IS THERE ARE RESERVISTS BECAUSE OF PAST YEAR. SAVINGS THAT HAVE ACCRUED SO THAT. AMOUNT KIND OF ROLES DO IT'S APPALLING BASE SPEAK. IT COULD BE SAID THAT THOSE FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR. ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT. SURE IS THERE A REASON WE'RE NOT USING THESE FUNDS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT. I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE. ANY CHANGER ADDITIONAL USE OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD JUST BE A AND AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. AND HOW YOU WOULD WANT TO USE THAT I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST FOR OTHER ONETIME INITIATIVES WHICH ARE COMING UP ON YOUR. AGENDA LATER AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION AND SO I THINK IT'S ALWAYS THE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FUNDS SHOULD BE USED HOW MUCH AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES. HOW MANY EMPLOYEES DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE THAT HELP YOU WITH ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF MY CHEST I? IT'S LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE. THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY AND THAT WE RECEIVED FUNDING BUT NOT POSITION AUTHORITY WHICH WE WILL COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT BUT IT'S PROBABLY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE POSITIONS TOTAL. IS THERE A. IS THERE A LACK AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DR ED RIGHT I'M I'M. IN NO MEANS AM I EVER TRYING TO PLACE BLAME ON TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND IT SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE APPROPRIATE FUNDS. WHAT ARE WE MISSING? IS IT NOT HAVING THE APPROPRIATE POSITIONS ARE THE OVERSIGHT IS THAT THE FACT THAT MONEY GOES OUT THE DOOR. WITHOUT HAVING CHECKED THE PLANS BEFOREHAND IS IT THE OVERSEEING DEPARTMENT ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO HOUSE THIS. I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE ARE GOING TO BE GRAPPLING WITH THIS YEAR. BUT IT'S. A BIT DISTURBING TO RECEIVE THIS AUDIT REPORT AND I MUST ADMIT. TO LOOK AT THE AUDIT REPORT THAT CAME BEFORE THIS AS WELL. THAT SHOWED MUCH OF THE SAME% PROBLEMS SO I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS A. A NEW PROBLEM THAT WERE ADDRESSING. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A CONTINUING THIS SO WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TO OPEN. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CANDOR AND BILLETED TO TALK ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE THREE. THERE YOU GO. ARE YOU GOING. CAN THAT OUT OF HERE. I DON'T KNOW IF. ACCORDINGLY. COMING. HOLD. IN. WHEN YOU'RE READY TO ORDER. SURE. SO AND. WHEN THE. DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WAS. DISMANTLED AND WE OBSERVE THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. SO FIVE PIECES OF THAT DEPARTMENT. THE. SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THAT HAVE BEEN HOUSED IN THE FORMER DEPARTMENTS. OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION THOSE INDIVIDUALS CAME OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE ABSORB THE EXPERTISE AND THE WORK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT BUT WE NEVER I'M CONSTITUTED OR RECONSTITUTED OFFICE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THE AGENDA HIGHLIGHTED THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A WEBSITE THAT WAS US STILL OPERATIONAL THAT HAD ALSO BEEN CARRIED OVER WHICH. ON IS NOT IN ESSENCE ACTUAL THERE'S NOT ACTUALLY AN OFFICE ON THE INDIVIDUALS I THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH WORKING WITH. OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND STAKEHOLDERS WORKING WITH. THE GRANTS THAT WE HAVE AROUND THE SUICIDE HOTLINES WE HAVE THREE STAFF THAT CONTINUE TO WORK ON ISSUES RELATING TO THE PREVENTION OF. SUICIDE AND WORKING WITH VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS BUT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE AN OFFICE. AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS REPORT UP THROUGH OUR MHSAA UNITS WE HAVE A SET OF SMALL DIVISION THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT TERMS OF THE STE SOME OF THE STAFF THAT DO THEIR AND. AND THEY WORK UNDER THAT UNDER THAT DIVISION. TOBY EWING WE HAVE YOU NEXT. WELL IN IN TERMS OF. SORRY I WAS I WAS. LISTENING. SO THE M. LAST YEAR THIS EIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO QUESTIONS IN THE PACKET ONE WITH IS REGARD TO THE WORK THAT WE'VE INITIATED IN TERMS OF US A STRATEGIC PLAN PROCESS HAD PREVENTION. AND THE OTHER IS AN UPDATE ON THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE PROJECT THAT THE NETS IN TERMS OF THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE PROJECT WE RECEIVE AN ANNUAL RIDLEY WAS GIVEN ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE BRIDGE DISTRICT. AND AND WE SORT OF MONITOR THEIR PROGRESS ASSESSMENT LARGELY CONSTRUCTION NOT SOMETHING THAT WE ACT IS IN OUR NO SKILL SET. COME THOUGH THAT LATEST REPORT FROM THEM I BELIEVE IT WAS NOVEMBER DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. A AFTER SOME DELAYS BECAUSE THAT THEY RECEIVED TWO BIDS TO THE WORK THE BIDS WERE WELL ABOVE THE PROJECTED. BUDGET FOR THAT WHERE THEY HAD TO GO OUT AND FIND ADDITIONAL RESOURCES DAMAGE TO SAY PROVIDES ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A PROJECT THAT IS OVER I THINK IT'S OF OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION BY NOW. THEY'VE STARTED THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS IN THAT THEY'RE IN THE FABRICATION STAGES OF BUILDING OUT THE GNATS. AND THE CANTILEVER STRUCTURAL SUPPORT THE HOLD THE NETS AND SO THEY'VE THEY'RE BEGINNING TO DO. BUILD OUT THE SAFETY STRUCTURES AROUND THE CONSTRUCTION SITES AND SO. THAT OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE BRIDGE DISTRICT SUGGESTED THAT WORK IS MOVING FORWARD IT'LL TAKE YOU TO FILL TAKE SOME TIME AND I THINK THE RUNNER ON A TOTAL OF FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME FROM SECURING THE FUNDING THROUGH COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. BUT IT IS MOVING FORWARD WITH THEM IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTE PLAN FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. OF THE COMMISSION FORMS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND THAT SUBCOMMITTEE OPERATES UNDER ALL THE BAGLEY KEENE RULES SO IT'S OPEN MEETING. WE HELD OUR FIRST MEETING IN IN REDDING EARLIER THAT ACTUALLY ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND THAT COUNTY HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SUICIDE IN THE STATE A LOT OF ISOLATED. OLDER WHITE MALES A AND SO WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY WE HELD A PUBLIC MEETING. AND HEARD FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND PROVIDERS AROUND THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING EMPHATICALLY AROUND THEIR PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN IN TERMS OF ENGAGING. MAN WHO OFTEN ARE RELUCTANT TO COMMENT GAGE TO TRADITIONAL STRATEGIES IN THE HOUSE SERVICES AND SO. AND IT WILL WE THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HEARING SCHEDULED FOR MAY IN SACRAMENTO WE'RE BRINGING IN. NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPERTS TO COME AND TALK WITH US ABOUT DATA ABOUT RISK FACTORS ABOUT A MODEL PROGRAMS AND AND WELL ORGANIZED ANOTHER SIMILAR PUBLIC HEARING. LATER IN THE YEAR THAT'LL START TO TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS IF AUTHOR REACHED OUT TO MOST OF THE SOCIAL NETWORK PLATFORMS BECAUSE THEY'RE FINDING THAT MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN SUICIDE CAR ON SOCIAL NETWORKS SYSTEMS. THEIR GOOGLING SEARCH TERMS HOW DO I RIDE IN AND INSERT WHATEVER. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR WHICH IS INFORMATION ON. DIFFER MODALITIES ARE PREVENTION STRATEGIES AND SO THEY WANT TO BE A PARTNER. AND TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN CONNECT THE SUCH A NETWORKING COMPANIES TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR SIDE SO WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB PREVENTING AN INTERVENING WHERE APPROPRIATE SO THAT WORK IS UNDER WAY WE'RE EXCITED WE WILL NOT HAVE THAT WORK DONE BY THE JULY DEADLINE. THAT YOU HAD ASKED WE WILL SEND YOU A LETTER TO EXPLAIN THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE AND WHEN WE THINK THAT THE WORK WILL BE DONE. WE ARE ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE RECOGNIZE THAT WERE AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY WERE NOT PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE DON'T WANT TO DRAFT A PLAN. THAT MISSION TO CONSIDER. WE WANT TO DRAFT A PLAN THAT THEY WILL ADOPT AND SO WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE WORK WE DO IS IT IN THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD FIND ACCEPTABLE MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU HAVE ANSWERING QUESTIONS MIGHT HAVE ON THIS PARLOR. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME I WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION OF SUICIDE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES IN OUR STATE I DID BRING SOME MATERIALS BUT THE SERGEANTS NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE APPROVED BEFORE WE COULD DISTRIBUTE THOSE. SO I THINK THE COUNTY IS. IN ADDITION TO THE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN THAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT HAVE SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT UNLIKELY BEFORE SEEN THEMSELVES VERY MUCH ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE ABILITY TO DO SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK. I THINK IT'S RARE IN OUR NATION THAT THE COUNTY BUT A WHOLE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYMENT PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AT ALL. AND NO OTHER COUNTY OR STATE IN THE NATION HAS BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A MENTAL HEALTH TO THE VOTERS SUCCESSFULLY IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND UP TO TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR REVENUES. TO TRY TO PREVENT FOLKS FROM BECOMING ILL OR MORE ILL AND HAS BEEN REALLY. NATIONALLY EXCITING THING TO BE ABLE TO BE PROUD OF. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COUNTIES ARE CERTAINLY USING MANY OF THEIR MHSAA COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION TO PUT SUICIDE PREVENTION. AND ACTIVITIES INTO LOCAL COMMUNITIES INCLUDING I'M SUPPORTING SUICIDE PREVENTION CRISIS LINES AND THEY'RE DOING TRAININGS COMMUNITY OUTREACH WORKING WITH SCHOOLS AND OTHERS. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE THERE DIFFERENT HIGH RISK POPULATIONS THAT YOU MIGHT TARGET IN THOSE ACTIVITIES COVER ONE OF THE EXCITING THINGS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO IS. A JOINTLY ADMINISTERED SET OF INVESTMENTS TO REALLY FOCUS IN ON SUICIDE PREVENTION ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THAT IS A STATE WIDE CRISIS AND THAT DOING IT FIFTY EIGHT TIMES WITH UNIQUE STRATEGIES WOULD NOT BE PERHAPS IT'S COST EFFECTIVE IS REALLY GETTING SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM. AROUND THE COUNTRY TO TELL US HOW WE MIGHT GET ARE THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK IN IN TRYING TO TAKE A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH TO SUICIDE PREVENTION. SO OVER THE SPAN OF THREE OR FOUR YEARS I'M COUNTIES JOINTLY ADMINISTERED I'M A REALLY LARGE CAMPAIGN CALLED KNOW THE SIGNS AND THAT'S AMONG SOME OF THE MATERIAL. WE'RE ABLE TO ACTUALLY REACH ONE OUT OF EVERY TWO CALIFORNIANS IN THE STATE. USING ADS IN MAGAZINES ON TELEVISIONS ON THE TH AND BILLBOARDS BROCHURES VIDEOS AND OTHER WAYS. TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND REALLY JUST LIKE YOU OR I IF YOU HAVE A PERSON IN YOUR LIFE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MIGHT HARM THEMSELVES WHAT DO YOU DO DO YOU HAVE THE CONVERSATION A NEPHEW DO. TO TRY TO BUST SOME OF THE MYTHS THAT ARE COMMON ABOUT THE THE CONCERNS THAT WELL IF I TALK TO THEM ABOUT SUICIDE I MIGHT ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THAT. I WHICH IS A MYTH BUT IN FACT TO GIVE YOU THE REAL WORDS TO USE AND TO TALK TO SOMEONE I WOULD REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SUICIDE IS PREVENTABLE DOT ORG WEBSITE. AND WE WOULD WE WERE ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT AND RAND FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPOSED TO THAT CAMPAIGN DEFINITELY FELT THEY WERE MORE CONFIDENT TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE IF THERE IS A PERSON IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY ITSELF AND THE CONTENT OF WHAT WAS BEING SAID WAS. CULTURALLY RELEVANT AND THE THE MATERIALS ARE NOW AVAILABLE IN ADDITION TO ENGLISH AND SPANISH IN CAMBODIAN CHINESE MONK MAYOR KOREAN ALLOW ME AND PUNJABI RUSSIAN SPANISH TAGALOG AND VIETNAMESE. OTHER ALSO SPECIAL OUTREACH MATERIALS DESIGNED FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTH AND THE LGBTQ YOUTH COMMUNITY AND BECAUSE SPANISH. SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS ARE AT HIGHER RISK IN MANY COMMUNITIES OF SUICIDE THERE ARE SPECIAL SPANISH LANGUAGE SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING. AND THAT WAS PROVIDED TO COMMUNITY HEALTH% WORKERS TO AND PRETORIUS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I WOULD ALSO AND MENTIONED SOME REALLY AMAZING WORK THAT HAS BEEN FUNDED WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND THROUGH A TRAINING CALLED AND PUNK NATO WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER TRAINING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE STAFF INSTRUCTORS AS WELL AS SOME STUDENTS ABOUT HOW TO. SPOT THE SIGNS THAT A YOUNG PERSON THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM MIGHT BE AT RISK AND WHAT TO DO TO REACH OUT AND GET THEM. AND HELP OVER TWELVE THOUSAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE STAFF AND STUDENTS WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OVER A HUNDRED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AROUND CALIFORNIA WERE TOUCHED BY THAT. AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT SOMETHING FUN AND IN A VERY MUCH MORE YOUTH CENTERED APPROACH. SOME OF YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THE DIRECTING CHANGE CAMPAIGN ACTUALLY OF DONE SCREENINGS AND AN AWARD CEREMONY DOWNTOWN HERE. AT THE CREST THEATER. DURING THE SPRING SO HUNDREDS OF. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE YOU SEE HAVE BEGUN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO. CREATE THEIR OWN. SHORT PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT COMMERCIAL OFTEN YEAH YOU KNOW. PORTRAYING THEMSELVES AND THEIR FRIENDS FROM SCHOOL AND THE POINT OF WHICH IS TO REALLY TRY TO. GET EMPOWER AND EMPOWER YOUTH TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH AND AS IMPORTANTLY TO FEEL COMFORTABLE INTERVENING IF THEY DO HAVE A FRIEND THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. SO DIRECTING CHANGE DOT ORG. IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE KINDS OF WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO REALLY WITH SCHOOLS AND I'M AN EVALUATION OF THAT FOUND THAT EIGHTY PER EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUICIDE SINCE JUST A SNAPSHOT OF SOME OF THE EXCITING WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEAL. AND WHEN COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO PUT THEIR INVESTMENTS TOGETHER AND GET CREATIVE. WE DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR AND THE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION ONE OF THEIR PURPOSES BEING TO SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS AND WORK WITH THE COUNTIES AND ARE CBO PARTNERS TO GET THE KIND OF WORK THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE OVER THESE. PAST AND FOURTEEN YEARS OR SO OF THE ACT AND TO THE GET US ALL IN A ROOM AND AND BE ABLE TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING NOT ONLY IN THE PREVENTION SPACE MORE I'M PROBABLY BUT CERTAINLY ON SUICIDE PREVENTION. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE THREE. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE AT THIS TIME. BUT WE. ARE. HI I AM DOCTOR KEY THE CURRY AND I'M THE CEO OF DIDI HIRSCH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND SUICIDE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL CHANGE THAT WE WILL STOP ONE LIFE AT A TIME. SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT NUMBERS AND. WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH THEM AND HOW THEY'RE BEING TRACKED I WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING. I CAN SAFELY LIVES ONE PERSON AT A TIME. AND THAT'S THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. ONE COUNSELOR TALKS TO ONE PERSON AND GIVES THEM A GLIMMER OF HOPE. THE THE MATH IT'S THAT THIS NEW LIFELINE USES HAVE BEEN VERIFIED BY RESEARCH AS BEING EFFECTIVE AND SAVING LIVES. HE MIGHT NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT OR YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT SINCE IT'S NATIONAL SANSA PAYS FOR THAT'S NOT TRUE THEY LAUNCHED IT. BUT THEY DO NOT PAY FOR IT WITHIN THE STATE'S. MOST LINES GET ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. IT'S DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT IT'S BASED ON RESEARCH. BEST PRACTICES. HAS Q. A ALL THE WINES ARE ACCREDITED. IT'S LINKED WITH FACEBOOK SO THAT OF SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK USE OF CERTAIN KEY WORDS. THAT. INDICATE THEY MAY BE SUICIDAL. THE LINE POPS UP THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE NUMBER IT HAS SPANISH TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. CALIFORNIA HAS TEN OF THOSE LINES. AND CALIFORNIA HAS NOT YET FOUND A WAY TO GO FROM ALLOCATING MONEY. TWO USING IT TO SAVE LIVES. AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT. IT'S BEEN UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE AND A LOT OF CHANGE. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN WERE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS COMMITTEE VOTED. TO ALLOCATE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO THE STE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE NETWORK. IN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN THE NEXT YEAR YOU VOTED AGAIN. TO ALLOCATE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION. AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE MONEY. I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF IT'S UNDERSTOOD A CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY IS ACCEPTABLE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE. CAN WE PAY FOR UPGRADES AND BONE SOFTWARE CAN WE PAY FOR DATA SYSTEMS CAN WE PAY FOR A GENERATOR SO THAT THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE WE CAN KEEP THE LINES UP. WHEN PEOPLE MOST NEED US CAN WOOD PAPER CUBICLES. THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HIRE CONSIDER IN. AND IF NONE OF THOSE CAN BE PAID FOR. AND WE'RE HAPPY TO MAKE YET ANOTHER BUDGET. AS LONG AS WE CAN GET THE MONEY. TO SAVE LIVES SO I REALLY ASK THAT WE THINK ABOUT. WHEN WE KNOW SOMETHING WORKS WHEN IT'S VALIDATED WHEN WE HAVE RESEARCH THAT AFTER PHONE CALLS PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY. TO TAKE pTHEIR LIVES LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ANNOUNCEMENTS CAN SPEAK. THANK YOU MA'AM. HI AM LYNN MORRISON THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT. OF CLINICAL OPERATIONS FOR DE HIRSCHMENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHERE WE HAVE THE OLDEST AND LONGEST STANDING SUICIDE PREVENTION CENTER IN THE NATION. I'M AND WE ARE MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. IT'S KETA MENTIONED WE DEFTLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS BEEN GOING THROUGH. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM ON TRYING TO EXECUTE THIS CONTRACT SO THAT WE CAN GET THIS FUNDING THAT WAS DESIGNATED FOR STATEWIDE SUICIDE PREVENTION. SERVICES. BUT IT'S IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY AT HOME AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWO YEARS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED WITHIN THAT TWO YEARS IS THAT THE SUICIDE RATES CONTINUE TO RISE. OUR CALL VOLUME AND THE INTENSITY OF THE CALLS THAT WERE GETTING ARE ALSO INCREASING. DE HIRSCH ó AND ALSO THERE HAVE BEEN IS MANY OF YOU KNOW MULTIPLE DISASTERS IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE WITH HURRICANES FIRES FLOODS SHOOTINGS. WE GET A LOT OF THOSE CALLS ON OUR DISASTER DISTRESS HELPLINE AS WELL AS ON THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. PEOPLE ARE MORE DISTRESSED THAN EVER LAST YEAR DO YOU HERSCHEL LOAN TOOK OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND CALLS ON OUR CRISIS LINE AND THAT KEEPS GOING UP. SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THESE TWO YEARS WITH WITHOUT THE FUNDING IS THAT. DIDI HIRSCH IS LUCKY THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. BUT OTHER COUNTIES AREN'T AS LUCKY SO THEY HAVE HAD TO CUT SERVICES OR REDUCE THEIR SERVICES. WE THEY HAVE. SHRUNK THEIR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OF WHERE THEY WILL TAKE CALLS FROM AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT DO YOU HIRSCH'S THE EMERGENCY. BACKUP FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT MEANS MORE CALLS ARE COMING TO US NOW BECAUSE OF THAT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WERE NEEDED MORE VOLUNTEERS THE CALLS ARE TAKING LONGER THEIR MORE INTENSE. THERE'S MORE TURNOVER AND VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE OF JUST THE DAILY GRIND OF TAKING THOSE CALLS. THAT WERE NEEDED MORE VOLUNTEERS IN MORE TRAINING. AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE A VOLUNTEER ON A SUICIDE CRISIS WHY WE DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY THEY GO THROUGH A HUNDRED PLUS HOURS OF TRAINING. BEFORE WE WILL EVEN PUT THEM ON A CALL ONCE THEY'RE ON A CALL THEY NEED THE OVERSIGHT. OF A SHIFT SUPERVISOR A MANAGER ON THAT CHEF TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR THOSE CALLS FOR A COUPLE MONTHS WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE GIVING CALIFORNIANS THE BEST POSSIBLE. CARE IN THE WORST SITUATION THAT THERE AND AT THAT TIME. WE ALSO KNOW THAT SOME COUNTIES HAVE HAD TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES TO PROVIDE ON CALL AFTER OUR SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE. TO JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET BUT THAT'S ALSO INCREASING THEIR CALL VOLUME SO IT'S IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. SO WERE ASKING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THIS COMMITTEE. TO HELP US TO SECURE THESE FUNDS FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR THE FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS SO THERE'S NO GAP IN SERVICES. AND WE CAN CONTINUE THIS LIFESAVING SERVICES THAT ARE SO NEEDED IN CRITICAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. UP BEFORE I GET THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE TO THAT COMMENTARY I DID WANT TO ON. MENTION THAT I BELIEVE HISTORICALLY THE COUNTIES PAID A PORTION OF THIS OF THE FUNDS TO HELP WITH THE SUICIDE HOTLINE. AND WAS WONDERING MISS BARLOW IF I COULD. IF. YOU COULD HELP TO RESPOND WHY THE COUNTIES NO LONGER ARE CONTRIBUTING TO A PORTION OF THE SUICIDE HOTLINE. ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE RECENT AUDIT. IT SEEMS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME FUNDS TO HELP US REACH OUR GOAL OF ENSURING THE SUICIDE HOTLINE IS OPEN. SURE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO BACK AND FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE SPECIFIC RISK. SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINES I AM AWARE THAT THE SUICIDE PREVENTION CAMPAIGN INCLUDING THE KNOW THE SCIENCE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE. FOUND WITH YOU THERE WAS A THOSE WERE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS OVER MULTI YEAR PERIOD EACH COUNTY WAS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OR NOT AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE INVESTMENTS AND A NUMBER OF COUNTIES ARE IN FACT CONTINUING. TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THESE KIND OF SIGNATURE PREVENTION CAMPAIGNS. OTHERS NOT BECAUSE OF EITHER OTHER LOCAL PRIORITIES THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DO PREVENTION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT NOT TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THE COUNTY SUPPORT OF THE HOTLINE SINCE SUBSTANCE GREAT AND IF I MADE DIRECTOR CAN'T GET A RESPONSE ON WHY. TWO YEARS OF FISCAL APPROPRIATIONS HAVE NOT. RENDERED ANNALS AND HOP SURE SO AND TO BE CLEAR WHEN YOUR WEB FUNDING WAS RECEIVED SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE LAST YEAR. AND I WOULD SHARE THE FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF THE CONTRACT NEGOTIATION HAS BEEN DIFFICULT. THERE ARE CERTAIN. REQUIREMENTS IN STATE CONTRACTING LA THAT WE DON'T. YOU DON'T NECESSARILY CONTROL BUT WE CERTAINLY FOLLOW THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. THERE'S ALLOWABLE COSTS THEY'RE ALLOWED TO BE USED IN EXPENDED AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE REFERENCE BY THE. TESTIMONY ARE NOT ALLOWABLE AND SO THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE NEGOTIATION BETWEEN US AND THE CONTRACTOR IS. THIS THERE ARE STATE CONTRACTING RULES THAT SAY WE CAN'T PAY FOR THOSE THINGS AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL I'M WE WERE TRYING TO CLOSE NEGOTIATIONS LAST WEEK. AND WE HAD TENDERED DONE IT WOULD CUT CONTRACTOR YOU TALKING LIKE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT I'M THE PERSON THAT JUST TESTIFIED FROM DIDI HIRSCH IS THE CONTRACTOR OKAY. SO THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS WHAT YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S ONE OKAY DE HIRSCH BUT. NONE OF JUST AS WE TALKED ABOUT BREEDING A FUNDS EARLIER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US IF COUNTIES WERE WILLING. TO BRAID FUNDS TO HELP ENSURE THAT THIS WAS COMING OUT BECAUSE THOSE FUNDS DO NOT HAVE THE SAME. REGULATIONS AS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT CORRECT. IF COUNTY YET IF YOU'RE USING TO DATE UNDER THEIR STATE CONTRACTING RULES SO IF YOU'RE NOT USING STATE FUNDS THEN. IF THE COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS BUT. RIGHT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF CERTAIN. ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AROUND WHAT WE CAN AND CAN'T. YOU STATE FUNDING FOR SO ALLOW ME TO PUT A PEN EN AND SAD LIKE TO COME BACK TO A DISCUSSION WITH EUNICE BARLOW LATER ON TO SEE IF THERE'S. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ENSURE THAT THIS NEEDED EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTABLE. FOR OUR STATE. IT'S JUST A COMMENT THOUGH I SO CALLED BACK TO THE BUREAUCRACY PART. SO IF THERE'S A A CLEAR SET OF OF OUR ALLOW BULLS THEN THERE SHOULD BE NO NEGOTIATION RIGHT. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS ABOUT BUT DIFFICULTY OVER NEGOTIATIONS IF THERE'S A A SET STANDARD. BACK TO MY REPORT CARD. AND OLOGY IS. I KNOW IF YOU GET EIGHTY PERCENT THAT'S BE IF YOU GET NINETY PERCENT AND ABOVE THAT'S AND EIGHTY AND IT'S VERY CLEAR. WILL THERE WOULD THERE SHOULD BE NO NEGOTIATION BACK AND FORTH IN MY OPINION. OUT UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I'M MISSING THAT'S THE BOOK I BARELY MISSING SOMETHING WELL THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T SIGNED A CONTRACT IS THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE CANNOT PAY FOR AND THAT CONTRACTOR HAS WANTED THEM PAID FOR SO THEY HAVEN'T SIGNED THE CONTRACT AND SO THAT'S. WHY WE DON'T HAVE ONE YET WE WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE A CONTRACT SO I HE I SEE IN THE BACK? NODS OF NO THAT'S NOT CORRECT. SO HOW IS IT THAT I CAN GET THE EXACT INFORMATION AND MAYBE YOU'LL AND AND THE CONTRACTOR IN THE SAME ROOM SO THAT WE CAN TALK THIS OUT WE COULD DO IT HERE. FROM. OR WE CAN DO IT. YOU KNOW PERHAPS OFF SITE AND AND SOMEBODY'S OFFICE SO THAT I'M ABLE TO HEAR BECAUSE IT'S NOT MAKING SENSE. AND SO. JUST. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. AND I. I'M FRUSTRATED AGAIN WITH THE ANSWERS ABOUT YOU KNOW PUTTING THE BLAME ON SOMEBODY ELSE AND THAT'S HOW IT FEELS THAT YOU'RE BLAMING THEM. OUT FOR THIS AND SO AM I BLAMING THEM TO BE FAIR WALT BUT THAT'S THE POINT I'M WHEN I SEE THEM. SAYING NO AND YOU SAYING YES THERE'S DEFINITELY. BACK TO MY REPORT CARDS IF THERE'S A STANDARD THAT YOU. PUT OUT AS. AND IT'S OUT THERE FOR OF. I KNOW LONG PERIOD OF TIME IN THE DOESN'T CHANGE IN BETWEEN I'M ASSUMING THAT THIS HAD ABOUT CRITERIA HAS BEEN ON ON. ON THE BOOKS AND THEY KNOW. OF THE RULES FOR A LONG TIME. BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME DOING A CONTRACT USING THESE FUNDS BUT ITS STATE FUNDING AS OPPOSED WE KNOW YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU USE THE FUNDS LAST YEAR YOU DO THEIR SET TWO YEARS OF FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED. ON THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED THOSE FUNDS. OKAY. I. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO TAKE THIS OFF LINE YEAH. IF I MAY. EN SENATOR RUBIO THAT THAT COMMITTEE ALSO HAS THE OPTION OF EXEMPTING THAT CONTRACT FROM THOSE RULES. AND THAT THAT'S THE NEXT QUESTION THOUGH IF IT'S CRITICAL TO SERVICES AN AND I CAN GET INTO THAT BUT IF IT'S CRITICAL TO SERVICES WERE NOT BUILDING CARS THIS IS PREVENTING. LIFESAVING IF NOT EVEN YOU KNOW OR WITH MIGHT HELP THEM THIS IS LIFESAVING. SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING AND WERE HUG THAT WERE HUNG UP ON THE TECHNICALITY YET PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND AGAIN TO MY EARLIER QUESTION AT WHAT POINT DOES THE ACTUAL LIKE A PERSON SAY HEY. THESE PEOPLE NEED HELP AS OPPOSED TO. YOU KNOW. WHATEVER IS GOING ON BECAUSE CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON. BETWEEN THE CONTRACTORS AND YOU GUYS. BUT IF THERE'S EXEMPTIONS THEN. SOME POINT AT SOME POINT SOMEBODY HAS TO SAY. THIS IS PEOPLE THAT ARE LOSING THEIR LIVES. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT PROVIDING THE SERVICES WHO IS THAT PERSON. AND THAT'S IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT FOR ME RIGHT NOW IS WHO IS THAT PERSON THAT. CAN SIT DOWN AND SAY. LOGICALLY. PEOPLE NEED HELP. AM I THINK WHERE YOU'RE GOING AND MAYBE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL IS IF DD HIRSCH COULD COME AND TESTIFY TO. WEAR SOME OF THE STRUGGLES CAR BECAUSE THERE'S. A HURDLE THAT'S DIRECTLY BEFORE US WE WANT TO REALLY GET PAST A HOPEFUL YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE DYESS HERE IS. OUR INTEREST IN FUNDING THIS PROGRAM LAST YEAR THAN THE SET CITY OF THIS PROGRAM AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT'S GOING ON ITSELF IF YOU WHAT MAN. I'M FIRST I WANNA CLARIFY. THAT I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY COUNTY BUT THE TEN. THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LIFELINE IN CALIFORNIA DO GET SOME DEGREE OF FUNDING FROM THEIR COUNTIES IT'S JUST THAT. AS THE NEED HAS GROWN. THE FUNDING HAS NOT NECESSARILY KEPT UP BUT I I WANNA. YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN CLARIFY THAT LA HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL. AN I SOMEONE SAID SOMETHING. EARLIER I THINK IT WAS SO RIGHT ON WE CAN'T HAVE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES DECIDING HOW WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE BE FUNDING THIS. THE OTHER THING IS THAT I DO I FEEL MAY BE BUT I MISUNDERSTOOD THAT YOU SAID WE HAVE RECEIVED. FUNDS THE FIRST YEAR'S WORTH OF BONDS. NOT NOT I THINK WITH YOU I'M NOT SURE IF. I THINK THAT THAT THE FUNDING WITH ALEC IF YOU WHICH IF MHSAA FUNDING FOR IT NEEDS TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. WHAT MADE IT VERY? SPRING OF LAST YEAR I HAVE SO I CAN SPEAK A BIT. LENA HUMPHRIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE A GIVEN THE VOLATILITY OF THAT MHSAA REVENUES THE TWENTY SIXTEEN AND BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATION AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATION. FOR SUICIDE HOTLINES INCLUDED PROFESSIONAL LANGUAGE THEN MADE IT CONTINGENT ON THE BILL BELOW THE OF THOSE FUNDS WITHIN THE STATE DIRECTED ADMINISTRATIVE RESOURCES. SO FINANCE ISSUES A NOTIFICATION AT THE CLOSE OF THE TALKS HERE SINCE THESE ARE TAX REVENUES. THAT ON MARCH THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN STATING THAT THERE WERE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES FOR THIS APPROPRIATION. IN APRIL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE FUNDS FOR RELEASED RELEASED THE DEPARTMENT. FOR THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATION AS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN. OF FINANCES RECEIVE THE NOTIFICATION. BUT A AND WILL BE ISSUING A NOTIFICATION SORT SHORTLY TO THE LEGISLATURE THROAT BIBER. NOT A PLEASE A SOMEWHERE RUBIO I CAN JUST IS OKAY SO THE QUESTION WAS UNANSWERED UP. THE YOUTH SOMEBODY SAID THAT THAT MONEY WAS GIVEN TO THEM. HOW THAT MONEY BEEN GIVEN NO WE WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANY MONEY YET WILL PROVIDE ANY HOTTER ASSOCIATIONS ARE STILL GOING ON BUT HAD A STATED THAT YOU PLATE OF THAT I'M HERE DATED SO I MISSTATED SO IF IT WAS SEAT WITH THE THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING HAD? IT WAS APPROPRIATE THREE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WHICH IS MY MISSTATEMENT AND THEN NOW AND FINANCES CLARIFIED AND I APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE BUT IF I WOULD IN A PROBE THAT CLARIFICATION WHAT IN THE MAKE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE AND THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT I HAVE. GETTING A MISINFORMATION AND IF NOBODY PROBES AND CLARIFY THAT WE DON'T GET THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN I WOULD ASK THAT PLEASE NEXT TIME WHEN YOU MAKE STATEMENTS LIKE THAT THAT THEY'RE CORRECT. OTHERWISE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE DYING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT APPROPRIATION AND YOU JUST STATED THAT YOU DID GIVE THEM THE MONEY. AND AND WE DID I THINK YOU RECEIVED THAT I I KNOW WE SEND IT TO YOU. WE DID SEND A SUMMARY A FIVE PAGE SUMMARY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN DIDI HIRSCH. AND THE. HEALTH CARE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. OVER THE LAST TWENTY MONTHS. THEN IF IT HIT THEIR EXTRAS HERE IF ANYONE NEEDS THEM WILL AND I'M GONNA. TO FOR NOW TO MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS ARE SO. BUT LET'S LOOK LET'S WALK THROUGH THIS BECAUSE HE EVEN AT. THE TABLES HERE FROM THE DIET IT SEEMS CONFUSED. THAT THE NOTES I HAVE HERE. AND IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WINNER RELY ON YOU SO. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND SEVENTEEN THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED. AND THE FINAL BUDGETS INCLUDED FOUR MILLION. AND FOUR POINT THREE MILLION RESPECTIVELY FOR SUICIDE HOTLINES. TRUE OR FALSE THAT IS CORRECT WITH OKAY MOTION LANGUAGE SO'S WORTH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SO. BOTTOM LINE. IS THAT'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION IN THE LAST TWO YEARS CORRECT. WITH A SLIGHT CLARIFICATION THAT INCLUDE A PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO STIPULATE THAT THERE WERE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE CAP. SO PROVIDED THAT THERE WERE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES BUT THOSE FINDINGS WOULD THOSE FUNDS OR ALL SEEN THAT THE STATE BUDGET HAS GONE FROM YOU KNOW THE EIGHTH LARGEST ECONOMY TO THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS I THINK THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDS. ARM. TO. HE HEARS WHAT QUITE FRANKLY IS REALLY IRRITATING FOR ME. IS I I KNOW MYSELF I KNOW THE CHAIRMAN. ALL QUITE A FEW MEMBERS IN THIS BUILDING WORK VERY VERY HARD OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. THE PUSH FOR VETERANS WHO SITE AWARENESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A MANDATE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY COUNTING THAT'S. IFYOU JUST TAKE THAT SIMPLE NUMBERS TWENTY TWO VETERAN SUICIDE THE DAY. ANY A MULTIPLIER THAT OUT FOR TWO YEARS. THE NUMBER IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND. SIXTY VETERAN SUICIDE. SO WHILE YOU ALL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT CONTRACT IS WHAT IT. THAT'S VETERANS DYING ON THE STREETS NOT TO INCLUDE EVERYBODY ELSE WHO NEEDS HELP. WELL LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION TO GETTING THIS RIGHT. WEATHER WE NEED TO CHECK WAY THAT THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OR WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT I'M NOT OKAY WITH PEOPLE DIED FROM SUICIDE ON OUR STREETS BECAUSE YOU ALL CAN'T FIGURE OUT CONTRACTS. I THINK. IF I. MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THE TWENTY TO VETERANS IS A. NATIONWIDE BUT YOUR. SENTIMENT IS APPROPRIATE. IF I MAY ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH US AND FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN GET PAST THIS ISSUE. SO WE CAN HELP TO APPROPRIATE THOSE FUNDS. AND WE KNOW AS WAS STATED EARLIER WE HAVE THE FUNDS WITHIN OUR STATE ADMINISTRATION WE NEED TO TRY TO WORK THROUGH. HOW WE ENSURE THAT THIS HOTLINE IS AFFECT SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR? I DON'T KNOW A NUMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY MISTER EWING. UP. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. APPRECIATE THE DEDICATION THE LONG DAYS GO INTO THIS. YOU KNOW I YEAR YOU KNOW THAT YOU BY THIS GENERAL QUESTION AS A PACKET EXPLAINS WORK MORE A COMMISSION OF THE STATE WERE INDEPENDENT. THEIR SIXTEEN COMMISSIONERS ARE TWELVE A WHO ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR. AND THEN A SITTING ASSEMBLY MEMBER SITTING SENATOR THE SUPERINTENDENT. AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SERVING THE COMMISSION. I'M WE HAVE THIS AS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BROAD OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ROLE. I SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OF THE FUNCTIONS THAT WE THAT WE TRY TO PUT IN PLACE. AS I JUST CURIOUS KNOWS WHO'S THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. CARILLO SCIENTIST YEAH EN SENATOR PELL GRANTS AND SIGHED. YEAH. HE WE HAVE WE AS I DESCRIBED THINK THE BEST ANALOGY AS WE ARE LIKE A MENTAL HEALTH GRAND JURY BUT OVER THE YEARS THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THE COMMISSION SOME VERY SPECIFIC AUTHORITIES. THAT ARE UNLIKE A GRAND JURY AYE WE REVIEW AND APPROVE COUNTY INNOVATION PLANS. AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE FRUSTRATION. OF THE MONEY THAT IS SUBJECT AB ONE FOURTEEN IT IS NORTH OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THAT IS INNOVATION MONEY ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THAT IS P. E. I. OR CSS. THE COMMISSION DOES REVIEW AND APPROVE INNOVATION DOLLARS OUR RESEARCH IN AND WE SHARED THIS WITH THE AUDITOR AND SHOWS THAT OUR OUR REVIEW PROCESS IS ABOUT SIXTY FIVE DAYS. AND SO THE AUDITOR CONCLUDED THAT DELAYS ON OUR SIDE ARE NOT THE REASON WHY COUNTIES ARE SPENDING THESE FUNDS IN FACT THERE ARE. THINGS SEVEN COUNTIES BASED ON THE LATEST RESEARCH THAT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT AN INNOVATION PLAN BEFORE THE COMMISSION. AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE IN THE PACKET SOME OF THE SOME OF THE FURTHER ITEMS WE ARE WORKING TO STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS INNOVATION TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT THE LANGUAGE OF THE OF THE POLICY IS QUITE ELEGANT. AND THAT IS PUSHING OUR SYSTEM TO BE PREVENTION ORIENTED TO TO REALLY FOCUS ON EARLY INTERVENTION AND IT SEES THIS THIS SIR. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVERALL IT'S ABOUT ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS BUT IT'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE WAY. WE DELIVER SERVICES TO REALLY DRIVE TOWARD BETTER OUTCOMES BETTER EFFICIENCIES N TERMS OF THAT CARE AND AND WE'RE STRUGGLING TO DO THAT BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE LATER AND AN ITEM. WE DO A FEW OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE WE HAVE TRIAGE FUNDS THAT ARE ALSO ON YOUR AGENDA ITEM WE SEE THOSE AS A VERY SIGNIFICANT TOOL WHICH TO THOSE HAS INCENTIVE FUNDS. WAYS THAT WE CAN REALLY ENCOURAGE PUSH OR INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO TRY THINGS THAT THEY MAY NOT BE DOING ON THEIR OWN. AND SO RECENTLY THE COMMISSION THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION DEDICATED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. BECAUSE IN WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE AROUND KIDS IN CRISIS WE'RE FINDING THAT CHILDREN OFTEN PRESENT IN CRISIS IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THERE ARE THOSE CRISES AT THREE IN THE MORNING WHERE THE CALLING NINE ONE ONE. THE QUITE OFTEN IT IS IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WE'VE HEARD HORROR STORIES OF SCHOOLS CALLING LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PUT A CHILD IN HANDCUFFS BUT IN THE BACK OF A POLICE CAR. AND DRIVE THEM DOWN TO LIKELY ARE AND THAT'S VERY TRAUMATIZING ON TOP OF THE ORIGINAL CRISIS. SO THE COULD THE COMMISSION A ADMINISTERS PART OF THE STATE'S SPD TWO AND A HALF WHILE THE SACK WITH TALK TO THE BIT ABOUT. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE WE HAVE A RESEARCH EVALUATION WORK SO THAT THE WORK THAT THAT REALLY LED TO THE AUDIT IN TERMS OF MONITORING. EVER VERSION FUNDS I WAS PART OF THAT WE RECENT YOU TO REPORT ON THE INTERSECTION OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND UNFORTUNATELY FOUND THAT TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEIR FIRST MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT CONTACT THAT'S INAPPROPRIATE. AND WE'RE WORKING TO TRY TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS THERE THAT'S ALSO ONE YOUR DENTAL LATER IN THE DAY. WE'VE WE'VE GOT A PROJECT ON THE HEALTH IN THE SCHOOLS FOR DENNIS'S HAD PREVENTION WE TALKED ABOUT. WE DO ISSUE REGULATIONS AND A SUMMER RUBIO I'VE ASKED THE STARTED TO GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL. YOUR ELF THE WEBSITE YEAH I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF AND DEMONSTRATE THAT. AND AND AND THAT WE'RE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS AS WE TALKED ABOUT TO REALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM WHERE IT'S GOING WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE MONEY. VERY CHALLENGING AND AND TO THE CHAIRS CORE QUESTION OF AND WE DO NOT YET HAVE THOSE METRICS EVEN THOUGH THE STATE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY ONE. TO COME UP WITH AGREED UPON SET OF INDICATORS THAT ALLOW THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND. WELL WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM WE HAVE MORE NEEDS ARE WE GETTING BETTER AT SERVING THOSE NEEDS AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING BUT I BUT I THINK. WERE MAKING PROBABLY MORE PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN ANY OTHER STATE IN PART BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND THE FACT THAT THAT YOU HAVE THIS. UNIQUE STATE LEVEL MENTAL HEALTH GRAND JURY THAT IS WORKING ON THIS AND AND NOT TRYING TO RUN A SYSTEM WHILE ALSO OVERSEAS. IT'S KINDA MIGHTN'T BROAD OVERVIEW OF IT HAPPEN RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. GREAT THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALLOW ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE FOR. WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR THIS TIME. SAYING NONO BRING IT UP TO THE DIETS AND ASKED QUESTION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US. THERE. IT SEEMS TO BE A DECREASE IN YOUR BUDGET AND WANTED YOU TO SEE IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHAT WAS THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT. YEAH PRIMARILY THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE IN THERE ONE TIME INCREASES IN PRIOR YEARS. THERE WAS FUNDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MADE AVAILABLE COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ON A ONE TIME BASIS SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS. AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT SO THE DECLINE IS NOT A DECLINE IN THE COR IN OUR CORE OPERATING BUDGET IT'S A REFLECTION OF THESE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THAT ARE NO LONGER REFLECTED IN THE BUDGET. I'M FROM THE OUTSIDE THE OF APPEARANCES THAT WERE DECREASING OVERSIGHT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR LAST AUDIT AND. WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY IF YOU LIKE TO REMEDY THAT. MISTER CHAIR. WAS NOT MY SUGGESTION BUT I APPRECIATE THE INPUT. THE HOME CINCO MORE FURTHER QUESTIONS ON ISSUE FOR WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. GREAT. SO THAT SO. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION REVIEWS AND APPROVING OF EIGHT PER PROVES COUNTY INNOVATION PROPOSALS RIGHT WE'VE BEEN. WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WE KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO USING THESE DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY. AND THAT THE COMMISSION. HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY CHALLENGES. FIRST WE'RE NOT SEEING WELL IT START THIS IS STARTING TO HAPPEN BUT. TRADITIONALLY WE WERE NOT SEEING COUNTIES THAT WERE COMING TOGETHER AROUND INNOVATION. EACH COUNTY PREPARED INDIVIDUAL INNOVATION PLANS AND THEY WERE QUITE OFTEN FOR A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR A FEW MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY WERE SMALL. A TECHNICAL SORT OF YOU KNOW. ADJUSTMENTS TO AN EXISTING PROGRAM TO MEET A GAP IN THEIR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. INNOVATION COMPONENT DEMENTIA SAY WAS REALLY INTENDED TO DRIVE TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE BIG SHIFTS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTFUL AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. AND SO THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO REALLY BRING THE COUNTIES TOGETHER AROUND SHARED CHALLENGES HOW CAN WE PULL THESE DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE IMPACTFUL OPPORTUNITIES. IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WE TEND TO SEE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING MINOR ADAPTATIONS PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT WE BELIEVE IS BECAUSE INNOVATION IS HARD. AND COUNTIES ARE PROPOSING THINGS THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKE TO BE SUCCESSFUL WITH AND SOFIA WANT THEM TO BE EDGIER IN THERE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES WE NEED TO GIVE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT THE ARTIST THE SECOND CHALLENGE THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED IS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF AN INNOVATION OVER A TRADITIONAL SERVICE. IN PART BECAUSE VERY FEW ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH PROGRAMS ACTUALLY HAVE IN HOUSE EVALUATORS AND EVALUATION OF INNOVATIONS ACTUALLY VERY DIFFICULT. IN THE FOURTH PIECES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DOING THOSE HIGH LEVEL EVALUATIONS WE REALLY WANTED TO DO THE DISSEMINATION SO THAT THE INNOVATIONS PURSUED BY ONE COUNTY WERE ACTUALLY INFLUENCING. ALL OF THE COUNTIES AND THROUGH THAT WE WERE GETTING BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK IN TERMS OF THIS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR MANDATORY SET ASIDE FOR INNOVATION. SO WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A PROPOSAL FOR THAT FOR THE COMMISSION TO DEVELOP AN INNOVATION INCUBATOR. IN FEBRUARY WE ACTUALLY CONVENE AN INNOVATION SUMMIT AND. WITH GOOGLE AND CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION THAT I THINK YOU MISTER EWING YOU MAY BE ONE ISSUE AHEAD OF US SEMI MONOGRAM ON ITEM FIVE. ISSUE FIVE. INNOVATION PLANNING BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE INNOVATION INCUBATOR IS THAT WE WERE REFERENCE NO RIGHT THERE'S THEIR NAME INNOVATION THERE'S A VERY SIMILAR I KNOW THERE'S A NAME TO BE. RIGHT UP. I'M WITH YOU OKAY SO WE AT. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE FROM WHAT WE'LL CALL THE INNOVATION SECTOR. THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE TECH SECTOR DATA ACADEMIA ALONG WITH COMMUNITY PROVIDERS COUNTY OFFICIALS CONSUMERS FAMILY MEMBERS TO REALLY TALK ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT HOW TO DO INNOVATION AROUND WHAT WE CALL THE HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN APPROACH. THAT ACTUALLY ACTUALLY ALSO HOW TO SUPPORT COUNTIES IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND SO. THAT WAS A ONE DAY WORKSHOP WE RECOGNIZED THAT IF WE WANT TO COUNTIES TO SUCCEED WITH THIS VERY CHALLENGING TASK OF INNOVATING THROUGH THE PUBLIC SECTOR WE NEED DIVIDE THEM SUPPORT. SO WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A PROPOSAL TO LAUNCH AN INNOVATION INCUBATOR. FIVE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AS A FOUNDATIONAL MONEY TO SET IT UP. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THEY'VE ASKED US TO FOCUS THAT ON REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE MHSAA. WE'RE THRILLED WITH THE SUPPORT AND THE PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WITH THAT WE RELEASED LAST NOVEMBER THAT HIGHLIGHTED MANY OF THE CHALLENGES KEEPING FOLKS WITH AND HOW NEEDS OUT OF JAIL. BUT. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE QUESTION AND I AM. THAT ISN'T BY THE TIME THEY'RE INTERFACING WITH OUR JAIL SYSTEM AREN'T WE. ALREADY LATE ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T THERE BE A MORE APPROPRIATE EARLY INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION UPSTREAM THAN ACTUALLY RECEIVING THEM IN A. CRIMINAL SYSTEM ABSOLUTELY ANY INTENTION IS NOT TO INNOVATE AROUND HOW TO RESTORE COMPETENCY THE INNOVATION IS HOW TO INVEST IN WHAT WE CALL THE ZERO INTERCEPT SO USING WHAT'S CALLED THE SEQUENTIAL INTERSTATE MODEL THE ZERO INTERCEPT MODEL. IS TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY SERVICES IN LIEU OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT RIGHT THAT THAT THE REALITIES SO YOU MAY HEAR LATER ON IN THE DAY ARE AT YOUR NEXT MEETING THE DEPARTMENTS THAT HOSPITALS WILL TALK WITH YOU ABOUT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE DEEMED COMPETENT STAND TRIAL. WE'RE NOT GETTING MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE SIX MONTH WINDOW PRIOR TO A FELONY ARREST. THESE ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST SEVERELY ILL WHY AREN'T WE SERVING THEM. SO THE THE GOAL HERE IS TO CREATE A FORUM WHERE WE CAN BRING THE COUNTIES TOGETHER. TO CONNECT THEM TO EACH OTHER TO CONNECT THEM WITH SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND REALLY LEVERAGE THE INNOVATION INVESTMENT IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT CRIMINAL REDUCES THAT CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WORTH TRYING BY GOOD YEAH. JUST NO INNOVATION NEEDED JUST PUT CALPERS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. UP MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS IN THEM ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS NOT ACADEMIC COUNTERS. AND I AND I AM BEING SARCASTIC OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT THERE IS NO I ONLY PARTIALLY PUT IT EXACTLY PUT THEM IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND YOU WILL MAKE SURE. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT THAT WOULD REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY I I WOULDN'T KNOW THE NUMBERS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THE INNOVATIVE THE INNOVATORS GIVE ME THOSE NUMBERS BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT IF YOU PUT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. BATON THAT WOULD CHANGE THE I'M SORRY I JUST HAVE TO INTERJECT THERE THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL NUMBER SIX. WELL ISSUE NUMBER SIX SUCH. A I THINK THE COMMISSION AGREES WITH YOU RIGHT IS THAT THAT THESE FUNDS NEED TO BE USED AGAIN THEIR EYES YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE IN THE ORDER OF TWO AND A HALF TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS. RIGHT THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT BEING USED IN WAYS THAT ARE REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT OR REDUCING SCHOOL FAILURE RIDE IN AND SO THAT'S THIS THIS TO WERE NOT THIS ACTUALLY ON TWO SEPARATE PROPOSALS THERE'S A NAY PARDON TO BE PART THE A IS BECAUSE IT IS INCLUDED IN THE. GOVERNOR'S BUDGET TO BE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE THIS BUDGET SO WHAT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO DO IS GET A PATH TO SUCCESS FOR INNOVATION IN CALIFORNIA BY CREATING A VENUE AND WE'VE DESIGNED THIS THAT THE STATE LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS AND TO SAY STATE FUNDS. WOULD BASICALLY SEED AND LAUNCH THIS THIS ENTITY WE WERE CONTRACTED OUT TO A NONPROFIT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE WORLD AND WE ARE NOT OF HOW TO DO IT. AND THE IDEA IS THAT WE WILL INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO BE OF THE USE THEIR EXISTING FUNDS TO PAY FOR THAT SEWER SERVICE ON AN ONGOING BASIS IT'S A MARKET TEST IN THE IDEAS OF WEAKENED SUPPORT THEIR ABILITY. TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY GIVEN THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HIGHLIGHT THE EVALUATION AND DO THAT THE LEARNING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT STATEWIDE THEN THEY CAN YOU KNOW USE OUR INNOVATION DOLLARS ACTUALLY. NO PAY FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE DESIGNING BUT THE INCUBATOR DOES IS HELP THEM DESIGN THEM IN A COLLABORATIVE STRATEGY AND OVER TIME THEY WOULD USE THEIR FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT SERVICE ONCE THE INITIAL STATES INITIAL INVESTMENT IS GONE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE FIVE. WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE OASES PROPOSAL FOR INCOMPETENT ARE FOR. THE MENTAL HEALTH INNOVATION PLANNING ASSISTANCE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S TAILORED TO THOSE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OF INCREASED INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE FIVE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU KIRSTEN BARLOW ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE DON'T HAVE A CONCRETE POSITION ON THIS VERY SPECIFIC PROPOSAL NOR THE CHILDREN'S INCUBATOR THAT'S ABOUT TO FOLLOW. HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THESE ARE STATE ADMIN FUNDS WHICH WE DISCUSSED QUITE A BIT EARLIER AND FROM WHAT I CAN UNDERSTAND THIS IS A TEN MILLION DOLLAR ASK WHEN YOU COMBINE THE TWO. I WOULD ONLY IT'S SORT OF POSE THE QUESTION ABOUT PRIORITY SETTING. WHEN AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE THE STATE EVALUATION OF THE OUTCOMES OF OUR CURRENT INVESTMENTS LET ALONE APPROPRIATING ANOTHER TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO LOOK AT SOME TIME AND ASPECT OF THE ACT THAT MAKES UP LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE SERVICES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY. SUMMER JUST A QUESTION FOR CONSIDERATION ABOUT OUR PRIORITIES WITH STATE ADMIN DOLLARS. THANK YOU MA'AM. KIMBERLY CHEN WITH A CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION'S FOCUS ON ENGAGING COUNTIES AND WITH REGARD TO THE. INNOVATION FUNDS AND. SPECIFIC TO THE TV CONTRACT WE ARE ENCOURAGED THAT WE SEE TO INCLUDE T. TO STAKEHOLDERS ON THE PROJECT. AT INNOVATION AND AND IT IS A NECESSARY PART. THAT AND IT'S BEING GENERATED A WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS BUT THE. APPROVAL PROCESS AND OTHER FACTORS. DO PERCENT CHALLENGES IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH COMMUNITY A STAKEHOLDERS AND COUNTIES I'M SOME OF GOTTEN. APPROVAL FOR PROJECTS THAT SPECIFICALLY US SERVE TO REDUCE RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES THERE A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE. WOULD HAVE GATHERED FROM THAT. ONE OF WHICH IS TO CLARIFY THE CRITERIA FOR INNOVATION. TO PROVIDE T. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AS WELL AS CREATING A SET OF STANDARD EVALUATION MEASURES FOR THE PROJECTS TO PROVIDE T. A FOR THAT UP. DEVELOPMENT THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FUNNY COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD ISSUE FIVE OPEN BUT WANT TO ON. AB SAY INNOVATION IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE IT IS BETTER FOR US TO COLLABORATE AND THERE'S A LOT OF MERITS TO THIS PROPOSAL THAT YOU BRING HERE TODAY. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX. BUT IF YOU SIX IS BASICALLY RECOGNIZING THAT THE NEEDS ARE MUCH GREATER THAN SIMPLY THE POPULATION THAT IS INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. PARTICULAR ON CHILDREN AND SO YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THE ASSEMBLYMEMBERS COMMENTARY ON CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS. THE THERE'S AN EQUAL. AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO GET DONE IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO USE THESE FUNDS EFFECTIVELY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN IN A PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES SO WHAT. WE'RE NOT ENVISIONING TO SEPARATE INCUBATORS HERE OR REP WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ENVISIONING AS A POT OF FUNDS. THAT CAN BE USED TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS RECOGNIZING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS THE IS INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL FIVE MILLION AND THEY'RE FOR ADULTS. THAT WE THINK THAT. ADDITIONAL FUNDS WOULD ALLOW THAT INCUBATED ALSO FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA. ó THE ADMINISTRATION. DOES NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL WE WERE UNAWARE AND HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW OR ANALYZE IT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX OF THE STUFF. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN SHELTON WITH STEINBERG INSTITUTE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. I'M IT'S QUIT SCHOOL THERE ARE REALLY KEY ACCESS POINT FOR THE EARLY INTERVENTION OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WE BELIEVE THIS PROJECT CAN DO. A LOT MORE TO STRENGTHEN THOSE COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HELEN RA THOUSAND TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS WHERE IT REALLY SUPPORT THESE NEW AND OF WAIT THEY HAVE WAYS OF LOOKING PARTICULARLY FOR SCHOOLS. WHERE THE KIDS ARE WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WHERE THE FUNDING FOR THESE PROPOSALS ARE THANK YOU? THANK YOU SEE NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I MEAN ED MIGHT TWO CENTS BUT. WE HELD A HEARING A WEEK AGO ON ACES AND. THERE IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK AT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING. AND THAT INTERFACE BETWEEN OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SCHOOLS AND HOPE THIS. INNOVATION INCUBATOR MAY BE A SOURCE TO A HELP. PROMOTE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. OKAY. AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ITEM ITEM SEVEN AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE OUR VICE CHAIR. MISTER COULD TERRIFY ME TAMPLIN. THAT SHIELD TALKS ABOUT THE SPECIFICS ABOUT THE PROPOSAL BUT JUST FOR FOR BACKGROUND. THE DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH BEFORE IT WAS DISSOLVED HAD A SERIES OF CONTRACTS FOR STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY. WHEN IT WAS ELIMINATED WHEN THE DEPARTMENTS ELIMINATED THOSE FUNDS CAME TO THE COMMISSION AT THAT TIME THERE WAS ABOUT ONE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN OUR BUDGET FOR FOUR SEPARATE CONTRACTS TARGETING CONSUMERS. FAMILY MEMBERS CHILDREN AND TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. AND OVER THE COURSE OF A COUPLE OF YEARS THE LEGISLATURE INCREASED FUNDING TO THE COMMISSION FROM ONE POINT NINE MILLION TO FOUR POINT SEVEN. ADDING FUNDS FOR VETERANS REDUCING DISPARITIES THE LGBTQ POPULATION BUT ALSO. ANA ELEVATING THE FUNDING LEVEL TO AN EQUAL SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND PER YEAR PER DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET. WE ISSUE THOSE DOLLARS IN A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS THAT WAS A CHANGE THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH YOU WHEN THOSE ALLOCATIONS FOR INCREASED AND IS NOW. STANDARD PRACTICE SOMETHING THAT YOU ASKED US TO DO. AND SO I'M WHAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS A PROPOSAL FOR SOME ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER DOLLARS THE THESE DOLLARS ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE. THESE ALLOW US TO FIND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY REALLY TRYING TO DRIVE THAT TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE INTO THE DECISIONS OF THE COUNTIES ARE MAKING BUT I'M I'M GOING TO DEFER TO MY. VICE CHAIR TED TALK THE SPECIFICS OF THE PROPOSALS AND HE TOLD ME AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY MY NAME IS TARA SLIMY TAMPLIN AND. I'M THE VICE CHAIR OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES OVERSIGHT INCOME ABILITY COMMISSION I WAS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AS A. ON THE COMMISSION AS A MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMER SIDE RECEIVE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OUR COUNTY SYSTEM AND ALSO CURRENTLY AND MY MOM'S INTERPRETER AND SUPPORTER FOR HER MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THE COUNTY. AND THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT SPECIFIES THAT THE IMAGE IT'S A FUNDS BE USED TO SUPPORT CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND TO PARTICIPATE IN POLICY AND PROGRAM. DECISIONS IN THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS REALLY WILL SUPPORT STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY FOR THOSE PURPOSES. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR AND SPITS SPECIFICALLY FOR. INDIVIDUALS HAVE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND REFUGEES AND IMMIGRANTS AND OUR. AND OUR STATE IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE COMMISSION REPORTED THAT TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE ACCESSING. ON MENTAL HEALTH CARE THROUGH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ON THESE FUNDS WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT WE DEVELOP COMMUNITY BASED STRATEGIES. AND TO PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH CARE RATHER THAN INCARCERATE PEOPLE. AND BECAUSE OF UNMET UNMET HEALTH NEEDS AND SIMILARLY THE COMMISSION IS HER TESTIMONY THAT MANY IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES. FACE CHALLENGES ACCESSING CARE. FOR REFUGEES SOMEWHERE TO ME AND MY FAMILY WHO CAME HARRIS REFUGEES FLEEING THE AFGHAN SOVIET WAR WE'VE HEARD MANY TALK ABOUT. HOW THEY HAVE ARRIVED IN OUR STATE AND OFTEN EXPERIENCING EXTREME TRAUMA ABUSE OTHER HARDSHIPS ON? AND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CULTURALLY COMPETENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SUCCESSFUL TRIP SETTLEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES OR PROLONG STE STRUGGLES. FOR IMMIGRANTS A CLIMATE IN THE US THESE DAYS IS NOT ALWAYS WELCOMING. THAT WE'VE HEARD STORIES ABOUT IMMIGRANT CHILDREN WHO ARE AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED THAT THEIR PARENTS. THE MOM AND DADS ARE NOT GOOD ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY NOT HOME AFTER THEY'VE LEFT SCHOOL WE'VE HEARD MANY STORIES ABOUT YOUNG FOLKS THAT ARE DACA RECIPIENTS AFRAID TO LEAVE THE HOUSE FOR ANY KIND OF. SUPPORT AND SO A AGAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAM IN THE HEALTH CARE CAN BE ESSENTIAL TO THEIR WELL BEING. SUPPORT THE SCHOOLS REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT AND SUPPORTING IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES THE COMMISSION IS ASKING FOR ONE POINT THREE FOUR MILLION TO SUPPORT TO ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER ADVOCACY CONTRACTS. AS AND. OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAS SHARED. THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT OUTREACH EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND ADVOCACY AND. THERE I THINK REALLY CRITICAL TO HELPING ALSO. ALLOWING THAT COMMUNITY TO FIND A VOICE FEEL EMPOWERED GET CONNECTED TO OTHERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING BUT ALSO FIGURE OUT HOW TO NAVIGATE OUR SYSTEM WHICH IS COMPLICATED AND IT DEPENDS ON WHICH COUNTY URINE. SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE ABLE TO BRING THOSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER TO SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS AND GET BETTER SERVE THE NEEDS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. CRISCO AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THAT CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER. WE'RE GONNA ICAP SEEING THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC I HELD NETWORK SENATE FROM SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSED INVESTMENT I IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES HAVE FACE LONGSTANDING BARRIERS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND ACCESS TO SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE. ARE GIVEN THAT YOU'RE MATTER CAN OFTEN VIOLATE MIGRATORY EXPERIENCE IS COUPLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS OF RECEIVING A HEALTH SERVICES THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK. OFFER MANY IT'S LIKELY THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES EXPERIENCE BEFORE AND AFTER. THEY ARRIVE MIGHT GO UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED FOR YEARS I LAST YEAR ICE DEPORTED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT MORE PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE U. S. SENATE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN. ARE A RECENT SURVEY AYE CFTC HELPED CONDUCT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTY ONE I HEALTH CARE EXPERTS PROVIDERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA UNDERSCORED THE REALITY THAT IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE INCREASINGLY FEARFUL. OF ENROLLING IN PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS DUE TO AGGRESSIVE DEPORTATION ACTIONS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I LAST YEAR'S UPC HEARD FROM NUMEROUS REFUGEES STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT CHALLENGES AN URGENT NEED TO REFUGEE CALIFORNIANS. ARE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC BARRIERS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LACK OF MEDICALLY TRAINED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. WELL THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IN WHICH IS ANTI IMMIGRANT POLICIES AND SYSTEMICALLY UNDERMINES AYE US REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT AS WE KNOW IT. AYE WE MUST STILL FIGHT TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR STATE AYE WE ARE THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS INVESTMENT SO THAT MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES OF CALL CALIFORNIA HOME. ARE INTENTIONALLY REPRESENTED IN THESE CRITICAL DISCUSSIONS REGARDING CALIFORNIA'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOT. FOUND THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE A POSITION ON THIS PROPOSAL. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. CAN'T REALLY TELL THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE WANNA EXPRESS OUR STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE MENTAL HEALTH PROPOSAL HERE AS MY COLLEAGUE. AND AND. MADAM VICE SHOWS. SPOKEN TO. IMMIGRANTS ARE CRITICAL IN GONNA REFUGEES ARE CRITICAL TO. OUR OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR OUR SOCIETIES AND WE VALUE THEM DEEPLY AND THAT'S THE STATE HAS DONE. TAKING MULTIPLE ACTIONS ON OTHER POLICY AREAS TO PROTECT IMMIGRANT COMMITTEES WE THINK MENTAL HEALTH IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS PART OF THAT. FROM OF THE WORK ON FROM THE FEDERAL THREATS IN DHAKA TO. THE MUSLIM THAN IN AND. IT IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED IT CREATES A SENSE THAT YOUR IMMIGRANT REFUGEE PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE PERHAPS ARE NOT AS VALUED AND. BUT WE REJECT THAT NOTION AND A STRONG SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. THANK YOU MA'AM. REBECCA GONZALEZ NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER JUST WANTED TO LEND OUR BOYS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU BECAME. ADRIN TALK ABOUT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION WITH UNIQUE NEEDS AND OFTEN STRUGGLE TAXES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO SUPPORT THE ADVOCACY. TO ENSURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE THEIR NEEDS MET. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVEN OPEN BUT I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO SAY THAT THE FEAR IS REAL BEING BORN AND DELAY NOW IN THE RECENT. TRAGEDY THAT WE HAD HAPPENED IN THE LANE L. WHERE. PARTS OF OUR COMMUNITY WERE ATTEMPTING TO ESCAPE ITS. HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT'S OCCURRING TODAY. WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE A GOOD AFTERNOON. I WANT THANK THE CHAIR AND ALSO MEMBERS FOR. INVITING US MY NAME IS RONALD WASHINGTON I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE AYE CALIFORNIA HEALTH FACILITIES FINANCING AUTHORITY IN THE CHARGES OFFICE. AND IT WOULD BE ALSO IS OUR CAROLINE ABUJA ARE SHE OVERSEES OUR. OUR GRANT PROGRAMS. OF WHICH WE WILL. TALK TODAY I JUST GIVE YOU A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF. THE INVESTMENT A MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANT PROGRAM AND THEN. SO THE COMPANION TO THAT IS TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH PROGRAM. SO JUST GIVE YOU A ARM. ARE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF SORT OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH EACH PROGRAM AND KIND OF TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FINDING AND. ARE COMPLIMENTS ON THAT PROGRAM AND. ALSO MET AT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE CAN HAPPEN PROGRAMMATIC KLAY. AND THEN. LASTLY JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF SOME OF THE OVERSIGHT THAT. THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THROUGH THE PROGRAM TO HELP US SORT OF STAY ABREAST OF. OUR THE PROGRESS OF THE COUNTIES ARE MAKING WITH THE MONEY. SO. AS YOU KNOW SENATE BILL. EIGHTY TWO WAS REALLY FOR. ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM. TO EXPAND A MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS CRISIS RESIDENTIAL CRISIS STABILIZATION TREATMENT FACILITIES AND ALSO. PEER RESPITE PROGRAMS. THE GOAL IN AND TWENTY FOURTEEN WAS TO ACTUALLY ADD TWENTY FIVE ADDITIONAL MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAMS. AND ADDITIONAL SCRUTINY TWO THOUSAND OF A CRISIS STABILIZATION AND CRISIS RESIDENTIAL BEARS TO THE PROGRAM. SO. WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE THAT TIME SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY? A APPROVED IN FIVE SEPARATE FUNDING ROUNDS. FOUND FIFTY SIX GRANT AWARDS FOUND THAT BENEFITTED. FORTY ONE SEPARATE COUNTIES. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ONE OF THOSE WAS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN. FIVE COUNTIES IN THE SUPERIOR REGION WHERE IT'S A LITTLE SMALLER SO THEY COLLABORATED ON A ON. ON A ON A GRAND AWARD WITH. BUT MERCED. DOT COLLABORATION INCLUDED ON ADDITION TO MERCED MADERA TO WOLLEMI. OP CALAVERAS MARIPOSA AND I BELIEVE STANISLAUS COUNTY. TO WORK ON ONE FACILITY AND HAVE A MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM THAT WOULD. PROVIDE. THE TRANSPORTATION TO THE FACILITY INMARSAT. SO THAT ONE HUNDRED AND. THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR. A FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AWARDED WE HAVE ACTUALLY DISPERSE. A LITTLE OVER FORTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS. SO ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT. HAS ALREADY GONE OUT THE DOOR TO. COUNTIES. WHAT WE HAVE ADDED OR WHAT WE HAVE AWARDED SPECIFICALLY ARE SEVEN HUNDRED AND AN EIGHTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL VETS? WE HAVE ALSO. OPENED UP DURING THAT PERIOD OF SEPARATE BEDS. BUT THEN WE ALSO HAD VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. OF A HUNDRED AND TEN MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM SO. ABOUT STAFF HAS MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THAT AREA. JUST A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. ALLOWS THE OUT AND. THEY HAVE A HOME ALSO HIRED FIFTY SEVEN ADDITIONAL STAFF FOR A MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM SO. ALL THE STAFF AND OF THE PROGRAM THAT WERE AWARDED WERE ALSO HIRED. SO THEN. SECONDLY DON'T TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CHALLENGES. SO. THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN A A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT STAFF IS EXPERIENCE. ALL I'LL TOUCH ON JUST A FEW OF THEM. I WOULD START WITH PROBABLY THE COUNTIES. OUR CHILD TO HAVING THE COORDINATE WITH THEM TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT APARTMENTS TO GET OUR APPROVAL OF A PROJECT. SO YOU MAY HAVE THEIR. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THEY THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT AND THE REAL ESTATE DEPARTMENT HAVING TO. COORDINATE ON THEIR EFFORTS IN ORDER TO. MAKE THE TIME REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS GRANT PROGRAM A MEAT THAT THE NEEDS OF THE GRANT REQUIREMENTS IN REGULATION SO. A WE HAVE EXPERIENCE OVER TIME A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES WITH THEIR THE INTER DEPARTMENTAL. LEVELS AT THE COUNTY THAT WE'VE HAD WORKED. AND HAVE PARTNERED WITH COUNTIES. YOU SEE THAT SUCCESSFUL. ARM. FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE NOT PURCHASING PROPERTY ON COUNTY OWNED LAND. OF SOME OF THEM HAVE EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO ACTUALLY FIND PROPER THAT TICKET PURCHASE. WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE COUNTY THEMSELVES IN THE REAL ESTATE DEPARTMENT OR EVEN THREW AWAY ON. A OUR SERVICE PROVIDER. MANY THE COUNTIES USE A SERVICE PROVIDER TO DELIVER THE SERVICES AND THAT SERVICE PROVIDER WILL ALSO. PURCHASE A PROPERTY TO BE USED FOR A TWENTY THIRTY APPEAR FOR THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT. SO THEY HAVE IN SOME AREAS EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY AND AND TRYING TO FIND A PROPERLY CAN PURCHASE IN A TIMELY MANNER. ARM. AND JUST TWO OTHER THINGS I THINK I WOULD MENTION. IN IN SOME CASES THERE HAS BEEN PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH I'M INTERACTION WITH. CITIES AND COUNTIES OF IS BITS OF LOCAL OPPOSITION IN THAT IN SOME INSTANCES. AND THAT HAS DELAY THE PROCESS FOR A NUMBER OF COUNTIES. AND AT LAST ABLE MITCH IN THAT. BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE TURN OVER THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED. I WITH THE COUNTY LEVEL EXECUTIVES. OFTEN THEY WILL. HAVE TURNOVER ENABLE. EITHER PUT THIS PROGRAM OR PROJECT ON THE BACK BURNER. OR CHANGE THE PARAMETERS OF A PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN AWARDED ALREADY SO. AND THAT HAS CAUSED SOME DELAYS IN IN AND. SOME CASES A COMPLETE CHANGE OF THE PROJECT. SECULAR. SO WE'VE HAD WORKED THROUGH THOSE AND AND MANY OTHER CHALLENGES. AS WE'VE PROGRESSED OF THIS PROGRAM RIGHT NOW. STAFF IS HAS DONE A A SIGNIFICANT JOB AND MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP FOR THE COUNTIES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE AND OVERCOME EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES. W.. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE NIGHT I THOUGHT SO WELL CHAFF A PROVIDES FUNDING FOR THAT MUCH OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE FUNDS AT THE COMMISSION RECEIVES ARE REALLY DEDICATED TOWARDS PERSONNEL. AND WE ISSUE WE PROVIDED A REPORT TO YOU BEGINNING OF THE YEAR OUTLINING THE OPPORTUNITIES BUT ALSO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES. I THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROGRAM AT THE COMMISSION BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW US TO CREATE SOME INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NOT OTHERWISE DOING. AND I'M MORE AWARE CHALLENGED BY THAT BECAUSE COUNTIES WILL ALSO SAY THESE CAN BE THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNDS THEY HAVE. AND YET WHEN THE FUNDS RIGHT NOW. AND YOU KNOW WE SEE FUNDS IN THEIR ACCOUNTS AND AND THERE'S QUESTIONS ARE ON THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM. AND WE SORT OF QUESTION THAT RIGHT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN MARCH INVESTING YOUR DOLLARS AND THREE. BUT EVEN RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT TOOL THAT THE STATE HAS TO SHAPE HOW COUNTIES INVEST IN THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS. THE COMMISSION IS A WELL AS THE COUNTY TO RECEIVE THESE FUNDS THROUGH OUR FIRST ROUND THE REALLY WRAPPING UP THAT PROGRAM AND YOU'LL HEAR THE NEXT ITEM OF REPORT OUT ON THAT AND THERE ARE SOME UNSPENT FUNDS. WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPEN WITH HIS DOLLARS WE'VE SEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH GET. CREATE MUCH STRONGER TEAMS BECAUSE THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED TO PUT PEOPLE IN PATROL CARS OR IT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO CAN WORK WITH FAMILIES AFTER THE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEAVES WHAT THESE OR OR THERE ARE OUTREACH STRATEGIES HAPPENING IN HOMELESS CAMPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT. OR EAT OR. PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSES WHO ARE YOU KNOW HIRED WITH THESE DOLLARS SO THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL. WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME CHALLENGES MANY OF THE CHALLENGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT ON THE FIFTH ON THE FACILITY SIDE. THAT IT HAS TAKEN A SOMETIME FOR COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT THESE PARTNERSHIPS. WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS TO ADDRESS THIS MOVING FORWARD WHERE START WE'RE ACTUALLY ENACTED PROCUREMENT NOW FOR SECOND ROUND OF TRIAGE GRANTS. THAT RECOGNIZING THAT ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE FIRST ALLOCATED THEIR ALLOCATED IN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR THE COUNTIES IDENTIFIED THEIR GREATEST PRIORITIES BUT EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THAT WENT TOWARD THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE REALLY TARGETING ADULTS. ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN PERCENT TARGETING CHILDREN. BECAUSE OF THAT IN THE SECOND ROUND THE COMMISSION DIRECTED STAFF TO WRITE THE RFP IN A WAY THAT AT LEAST HALF THE FUNDS MUST GO TOWARDS KIDS. AND WITHIN THAT HALF THAT IS FOR CHILDREN THEY SET ASIDE A PORTION TO BUILD STRONGER SCHOOL COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS AGAIN BECAUSE I RESEARCH INTO THIS CRISIS IS FINDING THE KIDS ARE PRESENTING IN SCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS. SO. WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF THINGS AS WELL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE DELAYS WE'RE REQUIRING. LETTERS OF INTENT FOR IT FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP AS A CONDITION OF THE APPLICATION SO THAT WHEN COUNTIES IF THEY'RE RECEIVING THESE FUNDS ARE NOT FACING THE SAME KINDS OF DELAYS. IN IN GETTING AGREEMENTS ACROSS MULTIPLE ENTITIES. THE AUDIT POINTED OUT THAT WE DID NOT DO A STATE LEVEL EVALUATION DURING THE FIRST ROUND WE'D WE WE DID REQUIRE THE COUNTIES DO AN EVALUATION OF THEIR PROGRAM AND WE DESIGNED THAT SPECIFICALLY. TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO EVALUATE THEIR PROGRAM AROUND THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE WE WANTED IT. TO BE SUSTAINED WITH THEIR LOCAL DOLLARS AND SO THE EVALUATIONS REALLY WERE DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR INFORMATION NEEDS THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT. IS THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL STATEWIDE STORY YOU GET VERY LOCALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION THAT VERY LITTLE THAT TELLS YOU HOW THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE BEHAVED. BECAUSE OF THAT CHALLENGE THE COMMISSION DIRECTED US TO TO SHIFT COURSE AND TO A A. FINE A THIRD PARTY EVALUATION AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL AND SO WERE IN NEGOTIATIONS NOW TO DO THAT BUT THE COMMISSION HAS ALREADY ADMINISTRATIVELY. DIRECTED THAT THE STAFF TO. PURSUE THAT STATE LEVEL EVALUATION WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. HABITAT RESPOND ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THAT WORK THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALEJO ISSUE EIGHT. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE A. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M DOCTOR LINTEL FROM THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES REPRESENTING THAT PROVIDERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. AS SO IT. WAS NOT TOUCH ON WAS THE CHILDREN. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AND THAT MONEY IS YOU GOT TO GO OUT SO LIKE HERE DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT SUICIDE PREVENTION WE'RE WAITING ON THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. WHICH IS REALLY WHAT I NEEDED FOR CHILDREN'S WE HAVE A NINE YEAR OLD THAT SAT IN AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN TEMPERATE CISCO FOR OVER THIRTY DAYS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD CRISIS NEEDS. THIS IS MONEY THAT NEEDS TO GO OUT TO SERVICES THINKING VACUUM. ANY FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT CON ISSUE EIGHT. SEEING NONE ALL BRING IT TO THE DYESS AND SHE. PREFACED MY QUESTION WELL. WHAT HAPPENS TO BOTH THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES GRANTS AS WELL AS THE? COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS. HAVE THESE MONIES BEEN APPROPRIATED AND. WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR THE? SO. YEAH. UNDER TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND I WAS HOPING TO GET TO IT BUT. SO. WE HAVE OF FUNDS THAT WERE APPROPRIATED IN THE BUDGET. BOTH GENERAL FUND AND AND NOW IMAGES SAY DOLLARS. IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN BUDGET TOTAL ABOUT TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS. THEY ARE. DIVIDED UP AMONG A A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS CRISIS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTERS AS I MENTIONED CRISIS STABILIZATION. THE ENTIRE GAMUT THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR REGULAR S. B. EIGHTY TWO MONEY. SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO NOW IS A COUPLE THINGS WE WANT TO GET OUR REGULATIONS OUT THAT WE CAN BEGIN. TO DO. AN APPLICATION PIER AND GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS FOR AWARDING GRANTS. BOB. WHAT YOU SAID TWENTY SEVEN MILLION AND THE COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THOSE IS OVER EIGHTY MILLION? WHAT IF WE LOOK AT COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS WAS A ONE TIME SIXTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION? GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION AND THE. CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES GRANTS WERE SEVENTEEN MILLION IN GENERAL FUND. FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT YOUR BALANCES TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IF. WE'VE. IN OUR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATED MORE FUNDS THAN THAT. CERTAINLY ME I'M CLEAR I WAS REFERRING TO JUST TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH BECAUSE I HADN'T GOTTEN TO THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE PIZZA PARA. SO. THE CHILDREN YOU PIECE IS REALLY COMPOSED OF TWO PARTS OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLAR POT AND ALSO A SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR PART. BOTH OF WHICH ARE GOING TO BE USED FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND THAT'S THAT'S A PIECE THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON DEVELOPING. REGULATIONS FOR. BUT ONE OF THE THE CHALLENGES WERE HAVING AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS TRYING TO. BOB ALLYING. FUNDING STREAMS AND WHICH. MONIES HAVE TO BE SPENT. AND ALSO ENCUMBERED SO BAD. ON IF WE'RE OVER SUBSCRIBED IN. ONE AREA AND UNDER SUBSCRIBE TO ANOTHER AREA SO FOR INSTANCE IF WE HAVE. A LACK OF RESPONSE. IN. MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAMS. AND AND MORE THAN ENOUGH RESPONSE IN FAMILY RESPITE CARE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ABILITY TO MOVE THOSE FUNDS FROM ONE POT TO THE NEXT. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY SIXTEEN FUNDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SPENT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO HOW OF WE APPROPRIATELY INSURED THAT THE MONEY IS GETTING OUT THE DOOR TO DEAL WITH THE. CRISES THAT WE HAVE GOING ON EACH AND EVERY DAY. BECAUSE THESE HAVE NOT BEEN. THEY DON'T HAVE REGULATIONS FOR. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVEN MINUTES ALSO SO. BECAUSE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN ARE PRETTY PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF THEIR POTS. SO FOR INSTANCE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. WE HAVE AN AMOUNT. THAT CAN BE YOU SPECIFICALLY FOR MOBILE CRISIS AND FAMILY RESPITE CARE BUT. IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT DEMAND FOR INSTANCE IT'S GOING TO BE. FAR LAST IN THE MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM. AS AN EXAMPLE SO WE HAVE SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION ABOUT AVAILABLE TO US. TO MAKE GRANTS FOR MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAMS. WHERE? CONFIDENT THAT THAT WILL BE SEVERELY UNDER SUBSCRIBED. AS A COMPARISON. IN THE A REGULAR SB EIGHTY TWO INVESTMENT MENTAL WELLNESS HEALTH PROGRAM WE HAD. A HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. WE HAD ABOUT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. POWER THAT WAS USED FOR MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM SO WE KNOW. THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO BE UNDER SUBSCRIBED. WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS TO BILL TO MOVE IT AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ONE OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS? SO THAT MONEY ISN'T LOST. HOW MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT SO FAR THAT WERE APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN? BUT NONE OF THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SPENT SO FAR THEY'VE NOT ISN'T THERE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. IF THEY WERE APPROPRIATED FOR A CRISIS CENTER. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A CRISIS CENTER. BY TWENTY EIGHT. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT REGULATIONS TO BE BEFORE US SO THAT THE FUNDS WE APPROPRIATED TWO YEARS AGO. ARE BEING EFFECTIVE FOR THEIR DOESN'T PURPOSE. ARE. SO. A PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WAS WORK. DEPARTMENT FRANCE YOU THINK IT THE POTS LINED UP SO THAT WE CAN THEN BEGIN TO DO REGULATION. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUMP IN HERE IS THERE SOMETHING. THAT WE CAN DO WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP TO ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY IS. AGAIN BEING AFFECT THEM MISTER CHAIR MARIKA'S ACCOMPANY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I FIRST WANT TO CLARIFY. HOW THE COLOR OF THE MONEY HAVE CHANGED SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN REVIEWED APPROPRIATE? SIXTEEN MILLION FOR IT CHILDREN'S CRISIS SERVICES GENERAL FUND AND THEN WE ALSO PROVIDED ELEVEN MILLION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCOUNT. A YEAR LATER AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE REVENUES HAVE. GONE DOWN WE CAN HAVE THE GENERAL FUND THEM THERE TO FUND THIS INVESTMENT SO. WE WE HAD TO LIKE TAKE BACK THE GENERAL FUND BUT WE REPLACE IT WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACCOUNT FUNDS SO. IN TWENTY TO TWENTY SIXTEEN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUNDING IS GOOD TO BE APPROPRIATED BILL TWENTY NINETEEN AND IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN FUNDING. IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW TO REPLACE THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE REMOVE THIS GOOD FOR A INCUMBENTS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY AND I THINK THAT GOES INTO THE. THE CHALLENGE THAT THE OUR COLLEAGUES FROM THE AUTHORITIES AND. IS A ADDRESSING IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT IT'S ALSO A NEW. A NEW PROGRAM I MEAN S. B. TO WAS TARGETED TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADULTS AND CHILDREN. WHEREAS S. B. AM EIGHT THIRTY THREE IS MORE TOWARDS PEDIATRIC CRISIS. AND ALSO WE AS FAR AS THE. DELINEATION IN THE CATEGORIES WERE YOU KNOW SUMMERS ARE ARE. PEGGED FOR CRISIS RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT SUMMER FOR QUESTIONS THAT POSITION SERVICES AND UNIT SOMEWHERE FOR MORE BUT CRISIS THEME SUMMER FOR FAMILY RESPECT. THOSE WERE THE DIVISION OF. THOSE AMOUNTS WERE SCHEDULE BASED ON THE GOALS THAT WERE SET AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE DEVELOPING THE FUNDING FOR S. B. THREE THREE SO. EVEN THOUGH. SO THIS ONE THING THAT WERE INCOMPLETE IN CONTINUE DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHORITY IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS IN THE LOCAL. IN A LOCAL CLUB. IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY BUT ALSO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE GOALS THAT WERE SET BY THE BY THE THE STATUTE MIGHT WAS PASSED IT'S SO HARD TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF KNOW MONEY'S GONE OUT THEM. I MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO CONTINUE A POINT AND I HOPE. TO LEAVE IT THERE I JUST AM HOPEFUL OF WORKING WITH THIS DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT. WE CAN HELP TO GET THAT MONEY OUT FOR THE CRISES THAT WE HAVE GOING ON EACH AND EVERY DAY. AND WITH THAT I HOPE WE CAN TURN THE DISCUSSION NOW TO THE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS PORTION OF THIS AND. I'M HERE THE APART SO THAT THE COMMITTEE SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM WAS THAT A SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR. ONE TIME GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. BOB AND SO. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF REALLY ACTUALLY DEVELOPING. STAKEHOLDER A GROUP THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH SO WE CAN GO ABOUT THE PROGRAM IT OBVIOUSLY. WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ARE NOT OUR AREA OF EXPERTISE SO WE WANTED TO. MAKE SURE WE FIRST IDENTIFIED. GROUPS THAT WE COULD WORK WITH AND THAT CAN HELP US TO DEVELOP AND BUILD A PROGRAM. I IN PART BASED ON USING SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES WE'VE LEARNED WHAT THE S. B. EIGHTY TWO INVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH WELLNESS GRANT PROGRAM. WE ALSO HAVE MET WITHOUT THE COUNCIL ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BOARD OF. STATE COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS CON BEHAVIOR HELP DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. AND A FEW OTHERS THAT I. SORT OF HELPED US BEGIN TO. DEVELOP WHAT WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR A FACILITIES BASED PROGRAM THAT WEEKEND. USED THESE FUNDS FOR SOME TO DEVELOP AND BUILD FACILITIES. UP FOR THIS POPULATION BUT. AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF. DEVELOPING THE PROGRAM JUST REALLY GETTING STAKEHOLDER INPUT IS HOW HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO GET INPUT AND AGAINST TO HAVE FUNDS GO OUT. WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT BY MAY REVISION TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR BOTH. THE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS AS WELL AS THE. CHILDREN'S CRISIS SERVICES GRANTS IS THAT A REASONABLE TIME FRAME FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT TO WORK ON A TIMELINE SO THAT WE MAY HAVE. INPUT AND. THAT OVERSIGHT. SO FOR THE CHILDREN AND YOU BY I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY NITA. WRAP IT UP THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. THAT WEEK. COLLABORATE WITH THEM CONTINUE TO GET AN AGREEMENT AS TO HOW WE'RE GOING TO ALLOCATE THE UNDS. SO. IF I CAN HAVE TIME TO. MAYBE HAVE ARE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM OFFLINE WE CAN COME UP WITH THAT DATE SPECIFIC THAT WE THINK WE CAN GET THAT PIECE WRAPPED UP. WELL I HOPE BY. MAY REVISION YOU GUYS CAN COME BACK TO ME WITH A CONCRETE PLAN FOR. US ON MAKING SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE. BEING SPENT APPROPRIATELY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS NORMA PAID NINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION. AND AS TOBY I'M DOCTOR UNIONS MENTIONED EARLIER IF WE RECEIVE A THIRTY TWO MILLION ON GOING ON THE WHOLE SERVICES ACT FUNDS FOR AT THE TIME TRIAGE PROGRAMS. AND WE ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS. ON WERE ASKING TODAY FOR I. REAPPROPRIATION OF THE UNSPENT FUNDS FROM THOSE PROGRAMS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THE AND COMMISSION ON ALLOCATED. ATTORNEY SHE ADDED I'M SORRY THE FIRST ROUND OF TRASH GRANDSON ALLOCATED APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED AND TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. ACROSS A FOUR YEAR GRANT CYCLE TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXPANDED CRISIS ORIENTED PROGRAMS. IN TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES. THE COMMISSION RECEIVED A TRIAGE APPLICATIONS FROM APPROXIMATELY FIFTY COUNTIES AND SETTING THE CITY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. AND AWARDED ARRANGING A GRANTS TO COUNTIES FOR A RANGE OF PROGRAMS. SOME OF THE COUNTIES IN THE SIZE PROGRAMS THAT PLACE PEER NAVIGATORS IN JAIL OR EMERGENCY ROOM SETTINGS TO ASSIST OTHER MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS AND CRISIS TO AVOID HOSPITALIZATION. OR JAIL INVOLVEMENT BY DIVERTING THEM INTO COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. OTHER COUNTIES DEPLOYED TRASH FUNDS TO SUPPORT COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH OUTREACH WORKERS TO DELIVER MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS SERVICES. IN THE FIELD AND TO FACILITATE AND SUPPORT ACCESS TO COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS. SEVERAL AND COUNTIES EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN ESTABLISHING OPERATIONAL AGREEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THE TRASH PROGRAMS TO SUCCEED. COUNTIES REPORT CAN REPORTS THAT OUR PROVIDED TO THE COMMISSION INDICATED THAT TRASH FUNDS ALLOW THE COUNTIES TO HIRE FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TRIAGE WORKERS. INITIAL GOAL OF THE ACT WAS TO HIRE AT LEAST SIX HUNDRED. MANY COUNTIES PROPOSED TO USE TRASH FUNDS TO HIRE MENTAL HEALTH PEERS AS NAVIGATORS OUTREACH WORKERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS. SOME THIRTY PERCENT OF TRASH PERSONNEL ARE PEER EMPLOYEES. AND HOWEVER. COUNTIES EXPERIENCED. DELAYS AND SOME OF THEIR HIRING OF THE ON STAFF FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND ALSO IT WAS CHALLENGED TO. COORDINATE WITH THE COMMUNITY AYE. IN THE COMMUNITY WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS. AND I'M WITH THE SCHOOLS. AND IT'S AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN GRANT AUTHORIZATION AND PROGRAMS START DATES RANGE FROM ONE WEEK TO EIGHTY EIGHT WEEKS WITH HALF PARTICIPATING COUNTIES TAKING MORE THAN THIRTY WEEKS TO SERVE THEIR FIRST CLIENT IN CRISIS. THESE DELAYED THE IMPACT OF THE ABILITY OF COUNTIES TO UTILIZE THEIR AUTHORIZED TRIAGE FUNDS. TO ASSIST COUNTIES THE COMMISSION EXTENDED THE GRANT TIME FRAME FROM FOUR YEARS TO FIVE YEARS. BUT IT'S STILL ANTICIPATED THAT WALL HIGH OF THIRTY POINT FOUR MILLION RETURNED IN UNSPENT FUNDS FROM THE GRANTS. WE LIKE TO USE THOSE FUNDS CHIU I'M IN THE NEXT GRANT CYCLE. IN THESE WOULD BE NEW GRANTS WITH NEW COUNTIES AND THE AS TOBY MENTIONS THE COMMISSION AUTHORIZED US TO. USE A PORTION THOSE FUNDS FOR CHILDREN CRISIS SERVICES AND ALSO SCHOOL THE MENTAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS. THE THREE MILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR OUR CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WOULD BE USED AND THOSE GRANTS FOR THE CHILDREN'S CRISIS SERVICES AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF SCORING THOSE GRANTS. THE FIRST AND THAT THAT'S THE THE THREE MILLION AS THE COMMISSION'S VERSION OF THE S. B. EIGHT THREE THREE FUND THAT YOU HAD ASKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND THE COMMISSION IS MOVING AHEAD WITH A THE SCORING OF THOSE PROGRAMS BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THESE FUNDS COULD BE RE APPROPRIATED. OUR CONCERN IS THAT NOT THAT WE WOULDN'T GET THE FUNDING OUT BUT THE COUNTIES WOULD HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING THE CONTRACTS SIGNED AND BACK TO US AND EXECUTED. BEFORE THE TURN JUNE THIRTIETH DEADLINE. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA. CHRIS GOT DEPARTMENT FINANCED SO AS THE COMMISSION NOTED THEY RECEIVED THIRTY TWO MILLION FOR THESE TRIAGE A PERSONAL GRANTS ANNUALLY AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE. HAVE BEEN SOME DIFFICULTIES IN THE PAST AND GETTING THESE FINDINGS OUT AND. THE FIRST YEAR ALTHOUGH ONCE THEY'RE ENCUMBERED THEY'RE AVAILABLE MUCH LONGER AND SO BEGINNING IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT THE GOVERNMENT THE BUDGET. NOW INCLUDES PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS TWO YOUR AVAILABILITY AN EXPENDITURE OF THESE FUNDS SO THE COMMISSION HAS A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO EXPAND THESE FUNDS. AND THEN ALSO JUST WANNA. NOTE THAT. AS OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ADMIN CAP THAT DOESN'T CONTEMPLATE ANY FURTHER RE APPROPRIATIONS OF THESE FUNDS AND THAT ANY. CONSIDERATION FOR YOUR PREPARATION WOULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE AVAILABLE ADMIN CAP DOLLARS MOVING FORWARD EXPLAIN THAT PART IF YOU CAN. SO FOR EXAMPLE THE ADMIN CAP. AT AT THE TIME OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS IDENTIFIED. AN AVAILABLE BALANCE OF SIXTY TWO POINT THREE MILLION. ANY APPROPRIATIONS OR OTHER APPROPRIATE ANY RE APPROPRIATIONS ARE THE APPROPRIATIONS BETTER INCLUDED. WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON THAT BALANCE INCLUDING THE TRIAGE. CORRECT. SO HOW MUCH LESS WOULD BE WITHIN THE STATE CAP. IF THOSE TRIAGE FUNDS WERE. APPROPRIATED. THE AMOUNT THAT WAS VERY APPROPRIATE. MISTER CHAIR AND WERE NOT SURE OF THAT AMOUNT BECAUSE THE THE CONTEXT OF THE COUNTIES ARE UNDER NOW ALLOW THEM EXPENDITURE RATE. RIGHT HOW MUCH ANOTHER ATTEMPT MANY CAN THEY SPEND BEFORE THE CONTRACT AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL BE. THERE THIRTY MILLION IS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE EXPECT. COUNTIES TO BE UNABLE TO SPEND BECAUSE THAT WE KNOW THEY CAN'T SPEND FASTER THAN THE RATE ALLOWED IN THEIR CONTRACT THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH SLOWER. THAN THAT RATE AND SO IT REALLY IS AN ESTIMATE. HELLO ANY COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE NOT. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK UP TO THE DYESS. I'M GOING TO USE SOME CHAIR PROVOCATIVE HERE BEING AND HE OUR DOCTOR I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT TRIAGE. AND. REALLY WOULD LIKE US TO. EVALUATE A PROGRAM THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PILOTING AT UC DAVIS. WHERE THEY'VE PLACED A PAIR PROVIDER INTO THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO HELP WITH TRIAGE? AND I BELIEVE THAT THE EARLY EVIDENCE THAT THEY'VE BEEN SHOWING HAS BEEN GOOD AND. ENCOURAGING. AND WILL WANT TO WORK WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO WORK ON SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO SEE IF A PORTION OF THESE TRIAGE FUNDS CAN BE SPENT TOWARDS PLACING A PURE PROVIDER IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. WHICH SEEMS LIKE THE GOAL THAT WE'VE WORKED ON. NOW THAT WON'T CHANGE THE LONG TERM ONGOING FUNDING THAT. COUNTIES HAVE CURRENTLY. THIS ONE TIME FUNDING I'D LIKE TO HAVE US CONSIDER. IF A PORTION OF THOSE FUNDS CAN BE SPENT ON THIS WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. A COMMITTEE CHAIR WHEN YOU READ. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STACY WALKER WITH THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROVIDED FUNDING OVER TEN YEARS TO SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE EDUCATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS. TWO HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION. WENT DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTIES TO SUPPORT COUNTY WET PROGRAMS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TWO AND THIRTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION. WAS ADAM ALLOCATED TO THE STATE FOR A MINISTRY IN STATE WEB PROGRAMS. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT COMMISSION. AND THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE OVERSIGHT AT THE COUNTY WET PROGRAMS OFSHE PET HAS NO AUTHORITY. OVER THOSE PROGRAMS. THE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION OF STATE ADMINISTERED WHAT PROGRAM SUPPORTED TWO FIVE YEAR PLANS. THE FIRST FIVE YEAR PLAN SPANNED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. IT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. AND THERE WERE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAMS IN THAT PLAN. WHEN THE. APARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH DISSOLVED OFF BUT BECAME RESPONSIBLE FOR FINISHING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE FIRST FIVE YEAR PLAN. WE ALSO DEVELOPED THE SECOND FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH INCLUDED A HUNDRED FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT AND STATEWIDE PROGRAMS THE SECOND FIVE YEAR PLAN WAS DEVELOPED WITH COMPREHENSIVE INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS. CANDACE BASED ON A PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. EXCUSE ME. THE PLAN INCLUDES PROGRAMS THAT INCENTIVIZE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE WORKERS INTO THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. IT ALSO INCLUDES PROGRAMS THAT EXPAND THE TRAINING AND EDUCATION CAPACITY WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTALHEALTH SYSTEM. AND FINALLY WE HAVE A ONE QUIRK GRANT PROGRAM. THAT. SUPPORTS COUNTIES THAT BAND TOGETHER TO ADDRESS STRATEGIC REGIONAL ISSUES. OUR CONTRACTS RUN THROUGH FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THEREFORE WHILE OUR OUTCOMES DATA ARE IMPRESSIVE THEY'RE NOT COMPLETE. AND THUS FAR OUR PROGRAMS HAVE ENCOURAGED INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE CAREERS AS MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. EXPOSING MORE THAN TWENTY SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS TO MENTAL HEALTH CAREERS AND PROVIDING NINETY STUDENTS WITH INTERNSHIPS IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE SUPPORT OF MORE THAN EIGHTY TWO HUNDRED MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OVER THE PAST NINE YEARS. BY PROVIDING UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOAN REPAYMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR WORKING IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR TWELVE MONTHS. MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND OF THOSE AWARDS WERE MADE JUST IN THE PAST THREE YEARS. PROVIDED MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY STIPENDS OF UP TO TWENTY ONE THOUSAND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. IN EXCHANGE FOR WORKING IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR TWELVE MONTHS. AND WE'VE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF RESIDENCY AND TRAINING SLOTS PROVIDING PROTECTIONS IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. WE HAVE TRAINED AT LEAST AN ADDITIONAL HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE CLINICAL PSYCHIATRISTS. AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PSYCHIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS. WE'VE ALSO SUPPORTED TRAINING JOB PLACEMENT OF MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE WITH IN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. SO IN ADDITION TO ADMINISTERING THE STATEWIDE WEB PROGRAMS A STATUTE REQUIRES ARE SPREAD TO DEVELOP A NEW WET PLAN FOR EVERY FIVE YEARS. WE'RE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THE NEXT WELL FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH WILL SPEND TWENTY TWENTY. TO TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND WE ANTICIPATE BRINGING THE PLAN BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PLANNING COUNCIL. FOR APPROVAL IN EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN SO THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER THEM THANK YOU MA'AM. MISS PARLOR. PERSON BOTH THE COUNTY BE EVER HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION I WAS ASKED TO DIS DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT THE MIDDLE HOLE SERVICES ACT. WORKFORCE IN EDUCATION TRAINING INVESTMENTS HAVE MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND BELIEVE. GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE VALUE OF THOSE THINGS FROM THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING AS WE QUERY AND THE REGIONS THAT ARE DIRECTORS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY DO AND A RECURRING THEME IS THAT REALLY WITHOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE THEY PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE DONE AND HAD RESOURCES TO ATTEND TO THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE NEEDS THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY THIS IS A SOURCE OF FUNDING. UNLIKE ANY OTHER THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THESE SORTS OF INVESTMENTS AND SO CONTINUITY OF THIS I'M IS VERY VALUABLE GIVEN THE REALLY WORK FOR SHORTAGE AND HEALTH CARE LET ALONE IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAT WE. IN CALIFORNIA FACE THAT THAT IS REFLECTED NATIONWIDE. AND SO A COUPLE JUST COMMENTS AND. SO MANY OF THE COUNTIES HAVE STATED THAT NOT ONLY IS IT IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE IN WORKING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD IN THEIR COMMUNITY BUT REALLY REFLECTING. AN ADDITIONAL WAYS TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE A MORE DIVERSE WORK FORCE WORKING IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. MOST COUNTIES AGAIN DON'T HAVE RESOURCES OUT OF THE OUTSIDE OF THIS TO DEVOTE TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND WHILE WE DO HAVE SOME IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THE FUTURE OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND. IMPROVED AND WE DO PLAN TO PARTICIPATE IN OFSHE PEDS. NEXT FIVE YEAR PLANNING PROCESS TO LOOK AT WHAT WE MIGHT DO IN THE FUTURE. AND SOME OF THE EXAMPLES I WOULD SAY. WORTH SHARING ONE IS JUST FROM YOURDISTRICT. CHAIR ARAMBULA. FRESNO COUNTY HAS RECENTLY PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SCHOLARSHIPS TO SUPPORT FIFTEEN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACTUALLY TO ATTEND ONE YEAR FELLOWSHIPS AND SO WE'RE BRINGING PRIMARY CARE. INTO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND REALLY LOOKING IMMIGRATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING COMING OUT OF THE THE LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT APPROACH. IN THE CENTRAL REGION. THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE UP FOR JUST AN EXAMPLE A ROVING SUPERVISOR PROGRAM WHERE WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ENOUGH CLINICIANS TO SUPERVISE THE STAFF WHO WERE TRYING TO GET. THEIR HOURS AND IN IN THAT REGION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT THE LICENSURE OF OVER FIFTY PEOPLE JUST IN THE CENTRAL REGION ALONE. I AM IN THE SUPERIOR REGION AND WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT. REALLY AS A MAJOR INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS WHO ARE WORKING AND THE SUCH SUPERIOR REGION NORTH IN OUR STATE. AND AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAM OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY INDIVIDUALS GRADUATED WITH THEIR BSW OR MSW AND UPON GRADUATING NINETY PERCENT HAVE ACTUALLY REMAINED IN THE SUPERIOR REGION WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT. GET YOUR EDUCATION AND THEN GO TO A MORE DESIRABLE COMMUNITY IS ALWAYS A CONCERN IN ANY AYE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE. I THINK AS YOU HAVE HEARD ME SPEAK BECAUSE I EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON ABOUT THE LACK OF A STATEWIDE STORY TO TELL. COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO AND DO YOU PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL DESCRIPTIONS AS WELL AS DATA ON THEIR LOCAL WET OR WORKFORCE EDUCATION TRAINING INITIATIVES IN THEIR THREE YEAR PLANS WHICH AGAIN ARE SHARED VERY PUBLICLY. NOT ONLY ON THE INTERNET OF THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY BUT ALSO THOSE. THOSE PLANS ARE PROVIDED TO STATE AGENCIES THOSE PLANS COULD BE USED AT ANY TIME TO BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER A STATEWIDE SNAPSHOT. AND WE ARE AWARE ASH BUT HAS RECENTLY CONTRACTED WITH THE UCSF HEALTH FOR CENTER TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION BUT WILL KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT LATER ON THIS YEAR. AND I GUESS I WOULD FINALIZED MY STATEMENT BY SAYING THAT THE COUNTIES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. THESE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN VERY. VALUABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FUNDS MIGHT BE AN ACCEPTABLE METHOD FOR FUNDING SOME OF THESE LOCAL INITIATIVES. THAT'S AN OPTION THAT SOME COUNTIES ARE LOOKING AT BUT MANY COUNTIES ARE REALLY UNCERTAIN THAT'S THE FUTURE OF BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BUILD. UP THE NUMBERS AND DIVERSITY OF THE WORK FORCE WE NEEDED MENTAL HEALTH CARE THAT OUR STATE. IF YOU THINK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA. NO COMMENT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TEN. KIMBERLY TEN. I CAN REALLY CHAT WITH A CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC. STEVEN IT'S. SUPPORT OF STATEWIDE STRATEGY. DIVERSIFYING THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE. LIKE IT'S PAST WE. HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OUTCOMES IN THIS. ABILITY TO OF MAINTAIN THESE. PROFESSIONS IN IN THE AREAS PARTICULARLY FOR. A MORE DIVERSIFIED WORKFORCE WE. NOTE THAT THE. AGENDA INCLUDES A NUMBER OF THOSE QUESTIONS AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO TO DELVE DEEPER INTO THEM AS THAT REMAINS AND HAS BEEN A CONSERVANCY AND FOR ON THE PAST. THANK YOU. WE UNDERFUNDED HEALTH ACCOUNTS OF COMMUNITY PAPER HOPE AGENCIES ALL BE SPEAKING OF A NEXT ON THE AGENDA. SO I'LL SAVE MY COMMENTS BUT IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS EGGMAN. GOOD AFTERNOON MELISSA AND MO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY FOR CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY AND THE GIST OF TIME A TO SAY THAT WE WOULD HONOR SUPPORT HER STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE SITE AND BEGIN. THE CAN. KELLY BEAM ON BEHALF OF THE I'M CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST REPRESENTING OVER THIRTY TWO THOUSAND MEMBERS AND WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROGRAM AND IT'S CRITICAL IN.

I AM VIRGINIA RUN THAT ARE NONE THIS AND I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION PROGRAM. IT'S KNOWN AS CATHOLIC A CATHOLIC OPERATES THE STATEWIDE IMAGE IT'S A STIPEND PROGRAM FOR MEMBERS W. STUDENTS. ARE WE OPERATE NINETEEN CAMPUSES ACROSS THE. STATE. I THINK ONE OF THE NOTABLE OF GOALS THAT WE HAVE IS TO PROVIDE STIPENDS AND RECRUIT. AND TRAIN CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE CULTURALLY COMPETENT STUDENTS WITH PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF CONSUMERS ARE AS FAMILY MEMBERS. OF CONSUMERS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM. BOB WE HAVE STAYED IN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE WHAT RENEWAL OF THE WET FUNDING WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THAT. AND WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DO NOT RECRUIT A COHORT NEEDS FOR CLINICAL SOCIAL WORK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACADEMIC YEAR. YOU KNOW THAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD ALLAH AT OUR UNIVERSITY STAND READY TO CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU. I WANTED TO ON I WILL TRY TO BE BRIEF SO WE CAN FINISH SOMETIME TONIGHT BUT DID WANTS TO. ASK ABOUT OUR. PROGRESSIVELY DIVERSIFYING WORK FORCE AND WHAT WE'RE DOING TO TRACK. AND FOLLOW ON THOSE CHANGES. PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF AS I'VE HEARD IT DESCRIBED THE AGE WAIVER SOBRE TSUNAMI THAT'S COMING. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE ARE REPLACING OUR WORK FORCE WITH ONE THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE? THAT IS ONE OF THE GOALS ADAM THAT'S INVENTED ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. AND I I DO HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY DATA ITS SELF REPORTED DATA FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO PARTICIPATE ARE PROGRAMS AND IT'S ONLY. TO DATE. BASED ON THAT INFORMATION OF THOSE WHO REPORTED THE INFORMATION. SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT WERE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY GROUPS AND FIFTY THREE PERCENT A SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH SO.

ALL OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AFTER WORKFORCE AND EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAM. THAT WAS AS FOR WHETHER TO TO BE SHORT. THE PROGRAM'S CURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN HAS ONLY BEEN BUDGET A FULL FOUR YEARS THROUGH THE END OF JUNE THE TWELVE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. AND ONE EAR EXPANSION IS NEITHER TO CONTINUE FUNDING CRITICAL PROGRAMS. ADDRESS IN OR EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE. BUT THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED pTHE PASSAGE OF THE A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT. TO ADDRESS JUST SHORTAGE THROUGH EFFORTS IN RECRUITING TRAINING. RETAINING MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. FUNDING FOR THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM WAS ALLOCATED FOR TEN YEARS STARTING TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. BEN EVERY FIVE YEARS TO ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENT IS TASK. WITH TO WORKING WITH TO STAKEHOLDER TO DEVELOP A NEW FIVE YEAR PLAN. HOWEVER AFTER THE FIRST FIVE YEARS DUE TO A TRANSITION OF ADMINISTRATION AFTER DID DISSOLUTION OF DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH. THERE WAS A GAP HERE. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND FOURTEEN. DOES AFTER WITH EMPLEADO FIRST FIVE YEAR PLAN. RESPONSIBILITY WAS SHIFTED TO THE OFFICE OF STATE WHY HOUSE PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT. AND THE SECOND FIVE YEAR PLAN DID NOT BEGIN UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND DISTRICT CRAFTS IS TO EXTEND A STATEWIDE PROGRAM FOR ONE YEAR THOSE A ONE TIME ASK. TO COMPLETE THE SECOND FIVE YEAR PLAN SO THEY COULD THEY BE ABLE TO HOPEFULLY GET READY TO A BEFORE THAT NAY ANOTHER FIVE YEAR PLAN AFTERWARDS. WET HOUSE RESULT IN VERY SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES LIKE THE MENTAL HEALTH LOAN ASSUMPTION PROGRAM. WHICH ASSIST MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WITH LOAN REPAYMENT IN EXCHANGE FOR TWELVE MONTHS OFF SERVICES INTO PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND UNTIL YOU THAT I HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY DEMAND.

VIRGINIA RUN BETTER HERNANDEZ FROM A CATHOLIC I JUST WANTED TO REITERATE THAT ONE WE SUPPORT THIS INTO TO DO BASS WOULD BE TO DISRUPT THE PIPELINE. ESPECIALLY WHEN IT PROTECT BY COMES TO A GENERATING A CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY DIVERSE WORKFORCE. THEY COMMIT. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWELVE OF BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I WANTED TO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHIU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD THIS IS BOTH TIMELY AND APPROPRIATE. IF I MAY ASK JUST ONE QUESTION I AM I THINK ABOUT IT IN PRIVATE AND SO NOW I'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHY. I'M IN A FIVE YEAR PLAN WHY WE RAN OUT OF MONEY AFTER FOUR YEARS. CAN DO WE EXPLAIN THAT SO THAT WE CAN HELP TO FILL THAT. GOODBYE TO ALL OF PIC OF HER SHAUNA THAT YOU PUBLIC CAN. BECAUSE IT WAS. BUT GOOD THE ORGANIZATION TO ADMINISTRATIVE. ENTITY DOT ORG LIGHT LEAKING CHANGE ON TO AND TWENTY THE CONSULTANT TOWARD WHAT WAS THIRTEEN. SO THE KNEW ORGANIZATION DIDN'T OF AND PICK IT UP. UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND SO DO SO DO WHEN HE PICKED PICKED UP IN. IT WAS ONLY FOR YOUR LEFT. AND THAT THAT'S WATER WORSHIP SHORT OF ONE YEARS OF THE FUNDING TO COMPLETE. BOTH SUPPOSED TO BE A FIVE YEAR PLAN SO I THOUGHT YOU SAID THERE WAS A GAP YEAR OVER THE METAL AND SO IT'S THAT YEAR THAN THAT WERE. SO PLEASE. MAN. SIPPING AT THANK YOU SOME MEMBER FOR THE QUESTION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONFUSION AND NONE OF US SITTING HERE WERE WERE THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT. RUSTY FELIX FELIX OUR SENIOR POLICY ADVISER HAS PROVIDED SOME INSIGHT TO THAT AS WELL AS OTHERS. I THINK IT'S AN ISSUE OF THE. PLANS NOT MATCHING UP WITH THE ALLOCATION YEARS RATE SO AS YOU HEARD THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ARE FUNDED THEM THERE WAS A GAP YEAR THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT GAP YEAR WASN'T FUNDED IT JUST MEANS THAT THERE WAS NO PLAN IN PLACE. TO THE NEXT FIVE YEAR PLANS STARTED AFTER THAT WHICH WAS OWNED AND THE ONLY A LOT OF FOR FOUR YEARS BECAUSE THAT WAS REMAINING TO THAT MAKE SENSE IT DOES SO WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE WAS A GAP YEAR AND FUNDING BUT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN THE PLANTS. WHICH LEADS US TO A FIVE YEAR PLAN THAT REALLY ONLY HAS FOUR YEARS OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO IMPLEMENT SO JUST SO I'M MAKING SURE OUR. WERE FUNDING. THE FIFTH YEAR OF A FIVE YEAR PLAN OF A SECOND FIVE YEAR BECAUSE WERE BACK FILLING. THE GAP YEAR WHICH WAS FUNDED WITH THIS FIVE YEAR PLAN IS THAT. IT WITH FUNDED WITHOUT A PLAN IN PLACE AT THE TIME DUE TO THE TRANSITION. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND. GOOD HAPPENING MISTER CHAIR NO JOHNSON OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE PLAN IS TIED TO A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF FUNDING FROM PROPOSITIONS THE THREE FUNDS. THE FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH RUNS FROM TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY NINETEEN SIMPLY PARALLELS THE TIME THE OFFICE BUT TOOK ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SECOND PLAN. OF THIS PLAN IS FULLY FUNDED IN THE FOR YOUR ALLOCATION IS MERELY ALIGNED WITH THE INITIAL COMMITMENT TO FUND WHAT PROGRAMS FROM TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ALL ALLOCATE WHAT FUNDS ARE BUDGET BE EXPENDED OVER THIS DETERMINE TENURE PERIOD. AND THE FINAL TWENTY EIGHTEEN. NINETEEN PERIOD HAS ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDING AS WELL SO. SEC. ALL IN THE BUDGET. WITH THAT I. WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND MOVED BACK TO ISSUE ELEVEN AND THANK YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLYMAN TO FOR. PRESENTING PARA THINK ABOUT GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR. MY NAME IS MORAL ASPECT I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION WITH AN ARCH PAD IN HERE TO PRESENT THE MENTAL HEALTH ONE ASSUMPTION PROGRAM SPRING FINANCE LETTER.

ANY COMMENTS ON ISSUE ELEVEN. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ELEVEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN. THANK YOU WHEN YOU'RE READY DR. IF I MIGHT MET LEAST ADJOURNMENT. I'M RENTAL HAGER'S YOU KNOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION I JUST ONE OF THE. INTRODUCED THE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO BE HERE TODAY TESTIFYING IN THIS MATTER. TO MY IMMEDIATE RIGHT IS DOCTOR ROBERT MCCARRON WHO IS THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR TRAINING NEW TRAINERS. PUBLIC NOW SORRY. PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. TO HIS RIGHT IS DOCTOR SHANNON SUE ó WHO HAS A PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THIS UC DAVIS DOCTOR. MCCARRON OF COURSE FROM UC IRVINE AND THEN WE HAVE. DOCTOR MICHELLE BURKE PARISHES THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH FOR THAT COMBINED PROGRAMS. YEAH I WANT TO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE LISTENING TO US. IT UNITS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE AGAIN MY NAME IS ROBERT MCCARRON. VICE CHAIR OF EDUCATION AGREED CARE SKYTREE AT UC IRVINE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS AT UC DAVIS HERE LOCALLY THOSE KIND OF MY HOME AWAY FROM HOME. ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE EMMA CURRENT AND CURRENT THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT ELECT. AND ALSO AS RENTAL MENTION CO DIRECTOR OF THIS PROGRAM ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO THIS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS I THINK WE'VE HEARD THIS SEVERAL GOING TO AN IN DEPTH WE NEED TO EXPAND THE MEN HEALTH WORKFORCE. WHEN YOU DO WE NEED TO DO IN A WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND EFFECTIVE. PARTICULARLY DAVIS IT'S EVOLVED OUT OF IT TOO SO THE CALIFORNIA UC IRVINE. EQUALLY OF THREE PROGRAMS ABOUT TWO TWO PROGRAMS ARE THIRD PROGRAM. IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS RIGHT IT'S WORKING RIGHT SO WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING HEADWAY WE ARE EXPANDING THE SECOND WORKFORCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BILLY PROBLEM IS THE DEMAND IS HIGH THE RESOURCES FOR THIS ARE LOW. SO WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR RESOURCES TO EXPAND WE'RE ABLE TO DO. IT. BEFORE I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROGRAM I JUST WANT A MINUTE OR SO TO TALK ABOUT WHAT LED US TO THIS WHY DID WE'D WANT TO DO THIS AS A GROUP OF MAINLY PHYSICIANS. WERE LARGELY DUALLY BOARDED NEITHER FAMILY MEDICINE OR INTRO MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY. NUMBER ONE DEPRESSION IS A LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY IN THE WORLD. NUMBER TWO. SUICIDE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT BETWEEN AGES TEN AND THIRTY FOUR TO SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH THIRTY YEARS EARLIER RELATIVE TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE SEVERE MY ILLNESS LARGELY. GOOD CARDIOVASCULAR INFECTION DISEASES. ONE OUT OF FIVE TWENTY TO SIX SUFFER WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES WE LEARNED EARLIER THEY ARE CURRENTLY. NOT ENOUGH MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH PSYCHIATRISTS DO A FEW QUICK STATISTICS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. PROJECTED SHORTAGES PSYCHIATRISTS WILL BE OVER FORTY PERCENT. AS OF NOW FORTY FIVE PERCENT A PSYCHIATRIST IN ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS ARE OVER. THE AGE. SIXTY. AND POISED TO RETIRE WITHIN THE NEXT DECADE OR SO SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIKE TO TELL YOU THE RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTOR THE ANSWER WILL NOT AND CANNOT BE TO BUILD MORE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS FOR MARRIAGE OF REASONS. THE SOLUTION SO WHERE DO YOU KNOW THAT PCP IS ARE THE FACT TO MY HEALTH PROVIDERS UP TO SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS. IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING TO GET NOT BY PSYCHIATRISTS NOT BY PSYCHOLOGISTS M. F. T. SOCIAL WORKERS. ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF PATIENT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING ON ANY GIVEN DAY. SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES EIGHTY PERCENT OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS WRITTEN BY NON PSYCHIATRISTS. PC PIECE HAVE A VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING. IN THIS FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY THAT'S A PROBLEM. BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF ALL THESE PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENT SPEND THREE YEARS. THREE YEARS LEARNING INTRO MEDICINE ADULT MEDICINE DURING THAT TIME. THERE THERE'S NO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. TRAINING IN THEIR OF SKYTREE. KEY STUDENTS AND STATE CALIFORNIA TWO WEEKS. TWO WEEKS TRAINING. AND YET THESE ARE THE FOLKS OUT THERE DELIVERING THE CARE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT P. CP'S COLLECTIVELY. TAKE CARE PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT THEY AT LEAST TREATING TRAINING TO DO SO. SO WE WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE HERE WE WANT TO DIVE INTO THIS AND MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS IT SQUARELY. THIS TRAINING NEW TRAINERS PRIMARY CARE PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP IS AN INNOVATIVE TRULY THIS POINT ONE OF A KIND. SASS FULL MODEL DESIGNED TO SQUARELY ADDRESSES PROBLEM THE FELLOWSHIP IS A ONE YEAR MENTORSHIP BASED EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH REALLY TEACHES. MAINLY TWO THINGS ONE HOW TO PREVENT. DIAGNOSE AND TREAT COMMENTS PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS NUMBER TWO. HOW TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND DISSEMINATED TO COLLEAGUES? RIGHT WE'RE TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO THIS PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED AREAS ARE FIRST CLASS AT THIRTY FELONS. OUR SECOND CLASS ABOUT FORTY TWO CURRENTLY SIXTY FELLOWS WE WANT TO SCALE LISTA THREE HUNDRED YEAR. WE ONE SKILL LISTA THREE HUNDRED YEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DEMAND IS HIGH. FOR THIS THE RESOURCES ARE NOT AT THIS TIME. QUICK SUMMARY OF OUR OUTCOMES FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S PAST MEAN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH. WE FOUND THAT OUR GRADUATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL KNOWLEDGE IN SKYTREE. INCREASED COMFORT IN TREATING DEPRESSION ANXIETY SUBSTANCE MISUSE INCREASED JOB SATISFACTION WHICH IS IMPORTANT IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING INCREASED RECOGNITION AND PREVENTION OF DEPRESSION. DECREASED MENTAL HEALTH RELATED STIGMA. WHICH I THINK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND THIS IS KIND OF NEAT EARLY DATA EARLY INDICATION SHOWS THAT WERE SEEN A DECREASE. WRITE A PRESCRIPTION OPIOID MEDICATIONS WE SPEND ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR TIME. DOT TALK NOR FELLOWS ABOUT PAIN MANAGEMENT AS RELATES TO MIDDLE OF CONDITIONS. SO IN SUMMARY. CALIFORNIA IS THE FIRST. THE FIRST TO SHOW A PATHWAY TO EXPANDING AND IMPROVING PSYCHIATRIC CARE. TICKLING AND UNDERSERVED AREAS. THE DEMAND FOR THIS TRAINING AMONG PCP IS VERY HIGH BUT RESOURCES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ARE LOW WE NEED THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS TO EXPAND WHAT WE'RE DOING. IN THE TNC PCP FELLOWSHIP IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO ADDRESSING THIS NEEDS I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN REALLY A VERY MUCH FOR CONSIDERING THIS INITIATIVE. IS I THINK IT'S GONNA MEANINGFULLY SPAN OPTIMIZER MEDICAL TRAINING ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU SIR. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN. THE AFTERNOON ADRIN SOLD SOME OF THE STEINBERG INSTANCE WRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL. WE KNOW GIVEN THE DATA THE DOCTOR MCCARRON JUST PRESENTED THAT WE CANNOT GROW OUR WAY OUT OF THE PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN. AND ALSO ON ANY GIVEN DAY IN THIS COUNTRY FORTY PERCENT OF THOSE PRESENTED IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING HAVE AN ACTOR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITION. I'M SO WE NEED TO BE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB TRAINING PRIMARY CARE FOR A PROVIDERS ON EARLY SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF RECOGNIZING MENTAL ILLNESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WE UNDERCURRENT THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH AGENCIES IN STRONG SUPPORT. IN GAME. MICHELLE BAKA WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WITH A SMALL INVESTMENT FOR THE STATE TO MAKE. WITH THE BIG PAYOFF AND. WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE SOFTENING REQUEST CONSIDERED THINKING. THANK YOU MA'AM AND ONE WHERE MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND THEY WANTED TO ME TO INDICATE THEIR SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. WITHOUT A BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS AND. AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE PROPOSAL I AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN. HOW YOU ARE HELPING THE UNDERSERVED AND? I'M MORE RURAL AREAS AS WELL AS REALLY FOCUSING ON PRIMARY CARE AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE THIRTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FORTH. THANK YOU WITH. WHEN YOU'RE READY GREAT. US SO WELL ONCE AGAIN JENNIFER CAN'T WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. YOUR AGENDA DOES A NICE JOB OF LAYING OUT THE. RATED FUNDING THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THAT TERMS OF THE NUMEROUS FUNDING SOURCES THAT. I'M COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO USE TO PROVIDE SERVICES. I WOULD KNOW THAT THEIR AGENDA ALSO. AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN WHICH I'M INDIVIDUALS CAN RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO OBVIOUSLY AND THE BOOK OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY HAS BEEN AROUND THE COUNTIES AND PROVIDING SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. BUT ALSO WITHIN MEDI CAL. ARE MEANT MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MILD TO MODERATE I'M SERVICES AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I'M IF INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES IN FEE FOR SERVICE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. THAT WE BOTH OVERSEE AND ADMINISTER. I THINK I ADDRESS THE QUESTION AROUND THE CARVING OUT OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND HOW THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE HISTORY AROUND THAT. I'M I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO KNOW. AND. QUESTION FOR. AROUND THE OIG AUDIT THAT WAS I RECENTLY RELEASED IN DRAFT FORM TO US AT THE END OF THE YEAR. KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS THE ANSWER FOR NUMBER FOUR WHICH IS THERE pON YOUR AGENDA SO ITS FOREIGN FOR. WHERE IT TALKS ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE SEE IF SERVICES FOR CHILDREN MORE FLEXIBLE LESS DEPENDENT ON DIAGNOSES? ON THE AUDIT. THAT WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH WITH THE YG. IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN WHICH BOTH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASES THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED AND THE. REALLY CLOSE. OVERSIGHT THAT IS INVOLVING BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING THOSE SERVICES IS PROBABLY GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN TERMS OF THEY ARE INCREASINGLY. MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT ON THE SERVICES MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THOSE. CRITERIA CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND THE. IN THE FILE AND THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A RECORD. SAID THE AUDIT. WE'RE HOPING WILL. YOU KNOW BE FINALIZED BY THE FEDERAL AWAY G. WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. AND WORKING WITH THEM TO READ THREE REVIEWS SEVERAL OF THE DISPUTED CLAIMS WHICH WERE OBVIOUSLY LOOK I'M LESSEN THE AMOUNT THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS AT THIS TIME THEY WERE GOING TO BE TAKING IT UNDER. SUBMISSION AND AND ISSUING A FINAL REPORT BUT I THINK YOU KNOW WE WOULD ALL AND STIPULATE THAT WE WISH THINGS WERE A LOT MORE. EASY AND FLEXIBLE BUT YOU KNOW GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS IN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PUBLIC FUNDS THAT'S PROBABLY NOT. THE MOST I REALISTIC AND HOPE AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND THEN I WILL I'M DEFERRED TO MS GRAY LISTS ON TO SPEAK MOST SPECIFICALLY ABOUT CANS BUT I WANTED TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION ABOUT THE. CANS DISCUSSION WITH. YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER AROUND METRICS. AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US AS A STATE TO HAVE METRICS THIS HAS BEEN A VERY LONG PROCESS FOR WHICH. BRENDA HAS BEEN INVOLVED FOR MANY MANY YEARS I'M WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT. THE NEED TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED TOOL ACROSS THE STATE WE ALSO FELT. STRONGLY THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT WERE CAPTURED IN THE DATA SO WE CHOSE TO TOOLS. SPECIFICALLY WITH THE INTEREST OF HAVING PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS. PROVIDING DATA ON THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW OUTCOMES WERE BEING. OVERSEEN AND THEIR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW SERVICES WERE BEING DELIVERED AND IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS HAVING A DIFFERENT. DATA ELEMENT THAT CAPTURED ON PROVIDER PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT WE CHOSE AND THERE'S A LOT OF. WORK THAT WENT INTO WHY WE CHOSE THOSE BUT I JUST WANTED TO YOU KNOW AND. YOU KNOW STRESSTHE FACT THAT WE FELT THE NEED TO HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT WE CAPTURE DATA ON AND WE ALSO FEEL REALLY STRONGLY THAT. YOU AND OTHERS. CONTINUE TO ASK WHAT HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THIS IS WORKING AND SO WE NEED TO KIND OF CAPTURE DATA IN A WAY THAT WE CAN. AND DO OUR BEST AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD NEVER STIPULATE THAT THERE'S A PERFECT. DATA MEASUREMENT TOOL THAT WE THINK THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH ITS I'M BOTH VERY AND. THOUGHTFUL IT WAS DRAWN OUT AND IT INVOLVES A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS. AND THEN. FINALLY JUST TO KIND OF GET THROUGH US SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAD ASSN THE AGENDA. AS YOU KNOW I'M YOUR BILL AB THREE FORTY AROUND. TRAUMA SCREENING WE ARE PREPARING TO KICK OFF ON THE WORK GROUP AND PURSUANT TO THE LEGISLATION. AND NOT GROUP HAS BEEN COMPOSED OF NOT ONLY. CLINICIANS FOR WHICH I. WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN WORKING WITH OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS WHICH IS I WANT TO HAVE. CLINICIANS WHO ARE WORKING WITH AFFECTED POPULATIONS BE ON THIS WORK GROUP ON THERE'S A COMPOSITION OF ADVOCATES COUNTY WELFARE. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REPRESENTATION. AND SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO KICK OFF AND I THINK THE GOAL OF THAT IS TO LOOK AT THE TOOLS THAT WE CURRENTLY USE AND TO SAY. ARE THESE THE RIGHT. ASSESSMENT TOOLS DO THEY CAPTURE THE INFORMATION IN A WAY THAT IS HELPFUL ON IF THERE ARE DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN OR SHOULD BE DONE WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCESS BY US. CHOOSING THOSE I'M AS THIS DEPARTMENT WHAT WITH THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS BE OBVIOUSLY FOR CHANGING SOME OF THOSE ASSESSMENTS AND SO I WE WERE WILL BE HAPPY TO KIND OF COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND LET YOU KNOW BUT. AND I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A BOTH STAFF AND OTHERS THAT ARE ON THAT WORK GROUP AS WELL NOT BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC SO. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO DEFER TO. BRENDA ON THE CANS IF THAT'S OKAY BEFORE WE GET THERE. DURING OUR ACES HEARING LAST WEEK I ASKED A CLINICIAN WHO'S ON THE FRONT LINES WHO WROTE THE BOOK. THE DEEPEST WHILE THAT HELPED BRING ME TO A SAYS IF SHE WOULD BE A PART OF THE WORK GROUP AND SHE SHOWED A WILLINGNESS. I WAS HOPING THAT I COULD WORK WITH YOU ON THE DEPARTMENT TO SEE IF WE COULD MAKE AN INVITATION TO HER RUSSIA ABSENCE I THINK SHE BRINGS QUITE A BIT OF EXPERTISE ABSOLUTELY YES THANK YOU. SOMETHING. DIRECTOR CAN THAT'S A PRETTY GREAT ALICIA I'M A LOT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES STEVE'S YES I THINK YOU DID A GREAT JOB ON HOW LAYING OUT. TURN WITH THE PERFORMANCE ARE CONSISTENT LEGISLATION IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WE STARTED OF WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUP. AND. YOU KNOW WE HAD I A GROUP OF FOLKS WHO WERE REALLY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT TOOL FOLKS CAME WITH THEIR DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN AND THAT THEY WERE VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND. AND SO THAT THERE WAS A VARIETY OF TOOLS AND. THERE WAS A A DISCUSSION OR A SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH TOOL OR COULD WE COULD WE ALLOW FOR ALL TOOLS. ANYTHING VERY QUICKLY THAT THEIR GROUP JUST LEARNED THAT THAT THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE SECOND GETS TO DIRECTOR KANSEN YOUR POINT ABOUT STANDARDIZATION. AND THE GROUP RECOMMENDED THAT WE. DO STUDIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST TOOL TO MEASURE I'M CHILDREN YOU FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AND SO I WE COMMISSIONED A STUDY. WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES AND I AND. WITH FUNDING FROM THEIR HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND EMBARKED ON A PRETTY RIGOROUS PROCESS OMINOUS SIGNAL TO A FEW STUDIES SO. THE INITIAL PART HAD TO DO WITH. I'M DOING A LITERATURE ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN ON TRY TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION ON CHINA WHAT'S THE STATE TO STAY IN THE TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. AND THEN WE ALSO SURVEYED COUNTIES TO FIND OUT WHAT COUNTIES WERE DOING AND WHAT THEY WERE USING. AND. USING THAT INFORMATION. UCLA HAD DEVELOPED PUBLIC ARE A COMPILATION OF TOOLS THAT WOULD MOVE TO A NEXT LEVEL WHICH IS A MODIFY DEL FI PANEL WHICH SHOWS A. GROUP OF DIFFERENT. PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTS SO I'M IT HAD KIDS ARE CONSUMER FAMILY MEMBERS POSE OUGHT WELLS CLINICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS SO FRIDAY OF OF PERSPECTIVES. AMENDMENT DID THE MODIFIED DELPHI PANEL REVIEWED THE TOOLS. ON THAT ARE. THEY ON CERTAIN LIKE ELEVEN CRITERIA SEVERAL CRITERIA. INCLUDING PSYCHOMETRICS ON A PERSONAL. BUT THE PERSPECTIVES BEING BEING. CAPTURED. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO ADMINISTER THE TOOL. LANGUAGES THAT IT WAS TO DEVELOP DAM UNAVAILABLE AND. SO THROUGH THAT AND THROUGH THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHICH WAS QUITE INVOLVED IN LENGTHY. UCLA RECOMMENDED THAT PEDIATRIC SYMPTOMS CHUCK WAS THIRTY FIVE. SO I THINK THAT WAS A VERY CLEAR RECOMMENDATION FROM THEM. VERY CLEAR TOOL THAT MADE UP IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TOP OF THEIR CRITERIA WHEN THEY DID THE FINAL RANKINGS. AND THEN. BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLINICIAN THOMAS LONG BEEN HAULED I'M NOT EVEN IN OUR JOURNAL PERFORMANCE OUTCOME SYSTEM WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES ARE NOT PERSON BUT SYSTEM RAN FROM NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND TWO I BELIEVE. WE DID MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES AT THAT TIME. WE'VE ALSO CONTINUE TO USE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES THROUGH OUR CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS SURVEYS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR. WELL OVER TEN YEARS AND THEN. AND THEN I ASKED. HIM. I WAS SO SO WE CONTINUE THAT VALUES TO HAVE MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVE SO WAS IT JUST ABOUT. MY APPEARING CARE GIVER PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO WITH THE CLINICAL PART THAT AS WELL. AND WITHOUT UCLA YOU LOOKING UP THAT MODIFIED DELPHI PANEL THAT THE THE TOOL THEY RECOMMENDED WAS ON CALL THAT A CHILD AND ADOLESCENT FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT SCALE. AND THE CALF IS. WAS ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL TO ALL THAT WE HAD USED IN THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM IN NINETY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND TWO WHICH WAS KIND OF SURPRISING THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS. WE'RE KIND OF AT THAT SEEM TOOL AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE. SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THOSE THAT TORN OTHER TOOLS ON THAT WERE OUT SELECTED AT THE TIME SO THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS DISBANDED ON IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. SO THAT NOT BEING A REAL VIABLE OPTION. WE LOOKED ACROSS THE DATA THAT UCLA HAD HAD CAPTURED AND LOOKED AT THE SURVEY DATA ON THE COUNTIES AND THIRTY THREE OF THE COUNTIES HAD. BEEN USING THE CANS IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND SO. RATHER THAN STARTING SOMETHING NEW WE CHOSE TO BUILD UPON WHAT WE AT WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE WAS ALREADY IN PLACE. SELECTED THE CANS TO BE THAT PARENT CAREGIVER. ATTRACT THE THE CLINICIAN PERSPECTIVE AND SO. YOU KNOW WE WENT THROUGH THE REGULAR BUDGET CYCLE AND SO ON AND SOFORTH AND THEN. YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD SOME. MOVEMENT FOR AS MANY FOLKS AS WE HAVE HAD LIKE YOU GUYS ITS BOOKS OF THEIR FAVORITE TOOLS ON AND THEY REALLY FEEL VERY PASSIONATELY ABOUT FIVE AND SO. SO WE HAVE VERY STRONG ADVOCATES FOR THE CANS AND WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE ADVOCATES FOR OTHER SCHOOLS ON THE MCAT. THANK YOU MISS BARLOW WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF. ISSUES CAPTURED IN THE SECTION OF THE AGENDA SO I THOUGHT IT WOULD ADDRESS THE TWO OR THREE OF THOSE JUST REAL QUICKLY. AND I WAS ASKED TO RESPOND TO OUR VIEW ON THE QUALITY AND ACCESS OF. COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT PRESENT AND I THINK AS IS WELL LAID OUT YOUR AGENDA YOU'VE GOT A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE VARIETY OF PROJECTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY OR SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY EXIST. IN TERMS OF ALLOWING PEOPLE. INCLUDING YOURSELVES AS THIS POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND THE LEVEL OF ACCESS THAT PEOPLE CURRENTLY HAVE SO THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOME SYSTEMS AND THE DASH BOARDS THAT ARE BEING CREATED WILL ALLOW FOR STATEWIDE STORY. AS WELL AS TO LOOK AT EVERY INDIVIDUAL COUNTY ON A VARIETY OF AREAS ONE OF WHICH IS OUR SERVICES TIMELY PROVIDED NO THAT THAT IS WHAT IS THAT ONE OF THE COMMON I'M FRUSTRATIONS THAT WE HEAR FROM. PROVIDERS AS WELL AS ADVOCATES FOR CONSUMERS AND FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY'RE NOT SATISFIED WITH HOW LONG IT MIGHT TAKE TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SO WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENTS I AM. EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE SET OF STANDARDS AROUND HOW LONG IT OUGHT TO TAKE AND TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES CURRENTLY COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN STANDARDS FOR WHAT'S TIMELY. WILL BE MOVING TO A STATEWIDE STANDARD. ADDITIONALLY WILL BE ALSO NEEDING TO FOLLOW SO THOSE WILL BE REALLY GOOD GUIDELINES AND WE'LL HAVE SOME GOOD BASELINE MEASURES TO KNOW HOW MUCH MORE WORK WERE LIKELY THEY NEED TO DO YOU. I'M A PARTICULAR AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE EVEN MORE IMPACTED BY WORKFORCE SHORTAGES OR LACK OF CBO PROVIDERS OR WHERE JUST THE TERRAIN IS DIFFICULT TO TO TRAVERSE FOR CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES TO GET TO CARE. AND SO IN LIGHT OF THAT WE OFTEN RELY ON THINGS LIKE JUST PENETRATION RATE SO WE LOOK AT THE CLAIMS. CUMIN WHO GOT SERVED AND WHAT DID THEY GET THAT'S NOT REALLY TELLING US THE STORY QUITE YET THOUGH. POINT I WAS MAKING EARLIER ABOUT THE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT ARE PEOPLE GETTING HEALTHIER. WHAT KINDS OF OUTCOMES ARE REPRODUCING SO WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO IN THAT AREA? I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE RECOGNITION WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT WERE FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES AS IT RELATES TO QUALITY AND ACCESS. SOME OF WHICH ARE A WORKFORCE SHORTAGES WHICH YOU JUST HURT QUITE A BIT ABOUT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF FUNDING STREAMS THAT THROUGH REALIGNMENT WERE ALL MANAGING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO TRY TO MEET NEED. BUT THEY ARE FAIRLY DISCONNECTED AS IT RELATES TO THE RULES THE TARGET POPULATIONS SO COUNTIES WHILE THEY ARE MANAGING OF AN ARRAY OF RESPONSIBILITIES WITH DEDICATED FUNDING STREAMS THERE ARE. SILOS IN WHICH THOSE THOSE FUNDS COME WITH AND THAT IS THE DIFFICULTY. WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS COUNTIES I'M HERE THAT IT HARD IS HARD TO NAVIGATE HOW TO GET HELP. FROM A CONSUMER AND FAMILY PERSPECTIVE KNOWING WHETHER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO START WITH THE DOCTOR A THERAPIST HAD EVEN FIND ONE IF MEDI CAL IS YOUR COVERAGE WHERE DO YOU BEGIN THAT PROCESS WE RECOGNIZE IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED AND HOW HOW TO HELP PEOPLE NAVIGATE CARE. AND THEN ONE PHRASE THAT WE KNOW WE'RE HEARING A LOT THAT'S NOT WORKING WELL FOR OUR USERS OF OUR SERVICES IS THE CONCEPT OF YOU'VE SEEN ONE COUNTY YOU'VE SEEN ONE COUNTY. AND WHILE ON ONE HAND THAT'S A REAL ASSET THAT WE HAVE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A RESPONSIVENESS TO REFLECT. THE LOCAL POPULATION AND YOUR LOCAL PRIORITIES THAT THERE OUGHT TO REALLY BE A STANDARD OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE THAT ANY MEDI CAL AND ROLL YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPECT TO GET. A REGARDLESS OF ITEM WHICH COUNTY THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE AND SO WE KNOW WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN THAT AREA. AND THEN I THINK WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO ANSWER THE CALL TO EXPAND OUR ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT WHETHER IT'S THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY REALIGNMENT. ARE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM IN MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC. THE NEED FOR BETTER CARE ANYMORE. QUICK CARE FOR CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT THERE'S AN ARRAY OF POPULATIONS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE NOT SERVING TO THE DEGREE WE OUGHT TO BE. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR PENETRATION RATES IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK BY DIAGNOSIS WE SEEM TO BE DOING BETTER IN THE AREAS OF PSYCHOSIS. AND AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS WHICH YOU. TEND TEND TO SEE BECAUSE OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT COME WITH THAT MORE SHIRLEY COMING INTO OUR DOORS AND I THINK. ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THAT DEPRESSION IS SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN LIVE SUCCESSFULLY WITH WHEN IN FACT I THINK I'M. INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH SHOWS THAT DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE MOST DISABLING HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS AMONG ALL HEALTH CARE CONDITIONS AMONG THOSE THINGS THAT ARE CHRONIC. AND CAN AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO WORK AND LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY SUCCESSFULLY. AND WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED IN YOUR AGENDA AROUND REEVALUATING HOW WE DETERMINE WHO GETS IN THE DOOR. OF THE COUNTY SYSTEM AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH IS TWENTY YEARS OLD AT THIS POINT. AND WE HAVE ANY IDEA SAM WE HAVE NEW THOUGHTS AND. NEW VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY ABOUT WHO REALLY OUGHT TO BE GETTING MENTAL HEALTH CARE. AND HAVING IT BE BASED ON DIAGNOSIS AND IMPAIRMENT MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. AND SEE BEACH CA HAS DEVELOPED INTERNALLY SO FAR. SOMETHING WERE CALLING THE TWENTY TWENTY INITIATIVE AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EXPIRE. I'M IN A FEW YEARS FROM NOW AND SEEING WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE SOME REFORMS THAT WE COULD PROPOSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. TO RELOOK AT THE QUESTIONS OF ARE WE SERVING THE RIGHT POPULATION ARE WE OFFERING AND THE RIGHT VALUE AND TO CONSUMERS AND TO REALLY. LOOK AT HOW WE TAKE OUR SYSTEM WORD ASSOCIATION OF OVER NINETY NONPROFIT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AND FOSTER CARE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT IS AT STAKE. THE WELL BEING OF OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE STATE. AND THE NEED TO CORRECTLY EVALUATE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BILLIONS OF STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS SPENT ON THEM ANNUALLY. THIS IS WHY THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWELVE SANCTION DH YES TO AN IN DEPTH STUDY. OF HOW BEST TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PST T. FUNDED SERVICES AND STATE. AND WHAT A DEEP CS FIND AFTER MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF ANALYSIS BY ITS HIRED EXPERTS AT UCLA. BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE OUTCOME TOOL AS THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PSE THIRTY FIVE. THAT MET ALL THE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA FOR TOOL SELECTION INCLUDING PROVEN RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY. IT DO YOU EACH YES WHEN I HAD THE MANDATE NOT JUST THE PSE THIRTY FIVE. BUT A SECOND TOOL THE CANS BUT YOU STILL A I BELIEVE AS IT WAS IN THE CONSULTANTS ANALYSIS SPECIFICALLY DETERMINED WAS QUOTE. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR OUT COMMISSION. WHAT ALL SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER? AS TO THIS CRITICAL ISSUE BEFORE YOU. ONE. THE EFFICIENCIES OF THE CANS AS AN AGGREGATE OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL. PARTICULARLY ADDED TO IT'S LACK OF PROVEN VALIDITY FOR THIS PURPOSE. HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGE NOT ONLY BY UCLA IN ITS REPORT. BUT ALSO BY EXPERTS IN THE HERO HEALTH MEASUREMENT FEEL. WE HAVE SPOKEN TO FROM UC DAVIS I BELIEVE YOU HAD A LETTER FROM DR NO NEED OF IT ALL MENTION IN A MINUTE. USC UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON AS WELLS THE CALIFORNIA HAVE A HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. NUMBER TO HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT THE USE OF THE CANS FOR OUTCOME MEASUREMENT. DOLLARS THAT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER SPENT ON DIRECT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. THOSE ON THE CHART THAT YOU SAW EARLIER TODAY. TWENTY TO OF THE THIRTY THREE COUNTIES THAT UCLA FOUND WERE USING THE CANS. WERE DETERMINED TO HAVE EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM WITH THE TOOL THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE UCLA STUDY. WITH OVER HALF OF THOSE COUNTIES HAVING SPECIFIC PROBLEMS. RELATED TO ITS ACCURACY OR THE RELIABILITY OF ITS SCORES AND RESULTS. WE'VE SPOKEN TO AT LEAST EIGHT OTHER COUNTIES AND THERE'S OTHERS BESIDES LOS ANGELES WHO EXPRESSED TO A SERIOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE USE OF THE CANS FOR OUTCOME MEASUREMENT. INCLUDING FRESNO COUNTY. ORANGE COUNTY CALAVERAS MONTEREY NAPA SAN DIEGO SAN LUIS OBISPO AND SANTA BARBARA. BEFORE CLOSING I'D LIKE TO BREED READ A BRIEF QUOTE FROM THE LETTER THAT REFERRED TO EARLIER THAT WAS SENT TO THIS COMMITTEE BY DOCTOR CHAIR NEED THEM. ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT UC DAVIS WHO HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE CANS. QUOTE AS A RESEARCHER AND PROGRAM DIRECTOR I ASK YOU TO PLEASE CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THIS DECISION WILL HAVE. ON PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE IN TERMS OF HOURS OF STAFF TIME IN CANS DATA COLLECTION. WHEN IT WILL SERVE NO PURPOSE BEYOND INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS AND STRENGTHS. IF PROGRAMS WISH TO USE THE CANS FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENT. ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. DO NOT PRETEND THAT THE DATA WILL BE USEFUL. STATEWIDE EVALUATION NOW OUR IN THE FUTURE ONE OF REPEAT THAT DO NOT PRETEND THAT THE DATA WILL BE USEFUL FOR STATEWIDE EVALUATION NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. IN CLOSING WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION. WHEN WE MAKE WHEN IT MAKES A FINAL DECISION ON THIS ISSUE. CAN WE REALLY AFFORD TO THROW ALL THESE PRECIOUS STATE REVENUES INTO FUNDING EVALUATION TOOL. THAT EXPERTS FROM A VARIETY OF ACT ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS SALES NOT BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE SAY THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY NO IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO STOP THIS ILL CONCEIVED MOVED. PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHAT IS AT STAKE HERE AND IF I MAY AND I HAVEN'T OTHER MINUTES IT TO TO MENTION SOMETHING. VERY I'M THERE WAS NO MENTION WHEN THE US STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MADE ITS PRESENTATION ABOUTTHE REPORT. ABOUT THINGS THAT WERE CITED BY THE INDIA QUESTIONS THAT WERE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SO FOR EXAMPLE THE HIGHER EXPERTS AT UCLA. FOUNDED THE CANS MET ONLY FOUR OF THE NINE MINIMUM CRITERIA FOR SELECTION OF THE TOOL ACCORDING TO THEM IN A FIGHT MODIFIED DELPHI PANEL. THE CANS RATE SEVENTH OF THE ELEVEN TOOLS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CARE. AND THIS IS DETERMINED TO BE THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTCOME AS ASSESSED BY THE TOOL. IS AN INDICATOR OF EFFECTIVE CARE. MAYBE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT THING YOU WANT TO KNOW. NINTH OF ELEVENTH ON THE TOOLS ON SCIENTIFIC ACCEPTABILITY. AND NINTH OF THE ELEVEN TOOLS AND FEASIBILITY. ONE FINAL COMMENT IN THE LETTER THAT WE GOT WERE COPIED ON FROM THE CALIFORNIA VERA HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THAT WAS SENT. THE SECRETARY DULY ON MARCH SIXTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE LETTER READS IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION POLICYMAKERS UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE. THE LIMITATIONS OF USING THE CANS TOOL FOR EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES OF SERVICES PROVIDED TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AS A SCRIBE IN DETAIL IN THE FEBRUARY TWENTIETH COALITION LETTER TO YOU. THE LIMITATIONS ABOUT WHICH CBO EACH DAY SUBSTANTIALLY CONCURS INCLUDE ONE INABILITY TO PROPERLY REFLECT CHANGE AT AN AGGREGATE PROGRAM LEVEL VERSUS AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD LEVEL. TWO CONCERNS RELATED TO THE VARIABILITY OF THE CANS TOOL PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO PROVING ITS RELIABILITY VALIDITY AS AN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL. AND THREE IMPACT OF EXCESSIVE CLINICIAN BURTON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SIR. HI GOOD EVENING I'M DEBBIE IN THIS GOMBERG IN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND I'M HERE TODAY AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT ON OUTCOMES. OVER THE LAST TWELVE YEARS I'VE LED A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT TO ANALYZE COLLECT AND REPORT ON OUTCOMES IN THE LA COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND PARTICULARLY AROUND IMAGES SAY. A I ALSO ON LED A COMPREHENSIVE EFFORT WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE IN THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. TO PRODUCE TO COMPREHENSIVE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP OUTCOME REPORTS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN. OUTCOMES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME BECAUSE THEY HOLD THEY HOLD THE SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE AND THEY ALSO PROVIDE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. AND I'VE BEEN A PARTICIPANT ON D. H. CS METRICS TASK FORCE THAT WAS THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER. AND WAS HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE OF OF. THEY'RE CHOOSING UCLA TO DO THE MODIFIED DELPHI IN THE IN THE LITERATURE REVIEW. AND WE WERE VERY HAPPY. THAT THAT HAPPENED. THE AND UNCERTAIN AS HIGHLIGHTED IN YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF ANALYSIS UCLA ULTIMATELY CONCLUDED THAT THE CANCER IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR MEASURING OUTCOMES STATEWIDE. A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN THE SUCCESS OF THE CANS AS AN ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING TOOL WHICH IS WHAT SOME OF THE COUNTIES USE THAT FOR. AT THE INDIVIDUAL CLIENT FAMILY LEVEL IS ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS WHICH TAKES THE UNIQUE NESS OF FAMILIES INTO ACCOUNT. IN DETERMINING HOW. UP IN INDIVIDUAL CHILD HAS PROGRESSED LET'S AT THE INDIVIDUAL CHILD LEVEL. THIS DOES NOT HOWEVER TRANSLATE. TO AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE AT THE AGGREGATE PROGRAM LEVEL WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS FOR THE P. STT POPULATION. AND INSTEAD TOWARDS THAT END WE NEED A MEANINGFUL STATISTIC STATISTICAL METRIC THAT CAN BE USED TO SUMMARIZE WHAT IS HAPPENING. ON A BROAD POPULATION LEVEL WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE BOTH EFFECTIVE RELIABLE AND VALID FOR WHAT WE CALL SEX PSYCHOMETRIC BELIEVE SOUND. IN ADEQUATELY PEER REVIEWED. OF THE PSE THIRTY FIVE FILLS THAT BOTTOM STANDARD. THE KANSAS NO ESTABLISH VALIDITY BEYOND GUIDING CLINICAL CARE AND TREATMENT PLANNING. AND BECAUSE IT WAS NOT DESIGNED AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE WAS DESIGNED AS PROCESS MEASURE. IN ADDITION THE COST OF THE CANS WAS WAY ON UNDERESTIMATED BY DH CS. IN LA ALONE. A LAST FISCAL YEAR WE HAD EIGHTY FOUR HUNDRED CLINICIANS SERVING SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND CLIENTS. WE ESTIMATED THE CLINICIANS WILL SPEND BETWEEN AN HOUR AND A HALF TO SIX HOURS PER YEAR. ADMINISTERING THE CANS FOR EACH E. PST TO RECIPIENTS. SYSTEM WIDE THIS CALCULUS IS TO. CALCULATES TO A HIGH OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND HOURS ADMINISTERING THE CANS. AND THAT'S THAT'S TAKING AWAY FROM CLINICAL CARE. FROM THE ESTIMATED COST OF ADMINISTERING THE KANSAS BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN LA COUNTY. IF YOU ARE TRAINING COSTS THAT COULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN MILLION TO THAT NIGHT DON'T GET TO INTO THE WEEDS AROUND US BUT. ON WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE THIS COULD YIELD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN THE ADMINISTRATION THE CANS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. TO CONCLUDE AS A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT TO EVALUATE. ITEM TO EVALUATION I URGE THAT THE STATE NOT MANDATE THE USE OF THE CANS TO MEASURE CHILDREN'S AKA MEASURES. BECAUSE BET THAT MONEY COULD BETTER BE SPENT SERVING CHILDREN AND DIRECT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. KIMBERLY CHEN OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK US EVEN LIKE TO THINK DOCTOR A BILL FOR OFFERING. AB FOR SEVENTY LAST YEAR WHICH REQUIRE DEEP SIESTA ADD DISPARITIES MEASUREMENTS OF THE PERFORMANCE OUT CONSISTENT SUPPORT AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES. WE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH DH THE S. IMPLEMENT THE LAW AND PROVIDE THE FIRST REPORT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. TO THAT AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE MANAGED CARE PLAN DID INTEGRATE WITH MENTAL HEALTH PLAN DATA AND THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOME SYSTEM TO GIVE A BETTER PICTURE OF ACCESS QUALITY AND OUTCOMES. AND US SEPARATELY AND TO ECHO THE COMMENTS ON THAT WERE SHARED PREVIOUSLY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO FIGURE OUT HOW COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN PROVIDE. MORE SERVICES WITHOUT RELIANCE ON MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS. THIS IS A PARTICULAR ISSUE FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ELLIE P. AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHO MAY DESCRIBE THE SYMPTOMS WITH DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY MAY HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND WHO MAY BE IMPACTED WITH TRAUMA AND NOT BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE THINGS IN A PARTICULAR WAY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS TERRY MANNERS AND I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO AT HALFWAY SYCAMORES. WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE ARE THE LARGEST. MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER FOR CHILDREN AND LA COUNTY. AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE FIELD AND LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER FOR OVER FORTY YEARS. SO THE DECISION TO REQUIRE THE SECONDARY TOOL WHICH WERE DISCUSSING IS THE CANS IS HIGHLY PROB PROBLEMATIC AS IT LACKS SCIENTIFIC. PSYCHOMETRIC DATA TO SUPPORT ITS VALIDITY THERE ARE ALSO SERIOUS CONCERNS. RELATED TO THE RIGOROUS TRAINING REQUIREMENTS QUALITY CONTROL AND VISIBILITY. THE UCLA REPORT WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. REPORTS THE PANELISTS WHO HAD EXPERIENCE WITH PRIOR MANDATES OF CANS FELT THAT THE MANDATE BECAUSE FEASIBILITY ISSUES. AND THAT THE TOLL DID NOT LIVE UP TO ITS POTENTIAL. IT ALSO QUESTIONS THE TOOLS VALIDITY AS A MARKER OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CARE. THE CANS DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD SENSITIVITY FOR. RATING FOR THE USE OF AN OUTCOME MEASURE THE TOOL TO BE UTILIZED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH VARYING DEGREES OF FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENTS. MEANING KIDS EITHER ENTERING INTO THE PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION IN OUR KIDS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE AND RESIDENTS TO CARE FOR EXAMPLE. BUT THERE'S A SERIOUS INABILITY OF APPROPRIATELY WITH TO REFLECT THE CHANGE OUT AN AGGREGATE PROGRAM LEVEL VERSES THAT THE INDIVIDUAL TARA LEVEL. SO IN OUR ORGANIZATION WE. HAVE BEEN USING THE CANS IN THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS WHICH REQUIRED IT. YEARS AGO IN THE RESIDENTIALLY BASED SERVICES PROGRAM AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN USING THE CAMPUS FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS. SO WE'VE. UP PULLED A COHORT OF DATA. AND WE LOOKED AT A SUBSECTION OF YOUTH THAT WERE IN THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE. AND WE LOOK THE SAME DATA FOR THE CANS. CANCER DATA AND WILK THE SAME DATA USING THE CALIPHATE'S AND WHAT YOU COULD SEE IS THAT THE CANS DATA ACTUALLY COLLAPSED. THE. THE AGGREGATE MEASURES AND IT SHOWED VERY LITTLE IMPROVEMENT. WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE CALPERS DATA IT DID SHOW IMPROVEMENT A IN THE YOUTH. SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT'S AN INABILITY TO SHOW ANY CHANGE AND HOW THESE YOUTH WERE FUNCTIONING WHICH IS WHY WE CONTINUE TO USE THE CAPS. SO IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING OR MEASURING CHANGE FOR THIS ENTIRE STATE ADAM WITH A VERY POPULATION. WOULD BE SIMPLY UNUSABLE. A THE JUST ANOTHER NOTE. BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS LOOKED AT. IN USING THE CANS WAS THAT OTHER STATES HAVE USED THE CANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND. OUR VICE PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AND EVALUATION WAS OF FORMALLY A PROFESSOR AT. UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANCER THAT STATE. AND SHE IS RELATED TO US THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT MONTANA EXPERIENCE WITH ITS ATTEMPTED USAGE FOR OUTCOME MEASUREMENT. INCLUDING THE LABOR INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE ONGOING ASSESSOR TRAINING AND THE INABILITY. TO DEVELOP A PROPER SCORING MECHANISM FOR CAPTURING AND REPORTING BACK MEANINGFUL DATA SO THE KANSAS NO LONGER BEING USED UP IN MONTANA. I JUST HAVE ONE OTHER COMMENT ABOUT THE CAMPUS THAT WAS MADE EARLIER. ON THE PROBLEM WITH THE KAFIRS WAS NOT THE TOOL. IT WAS THE COST IN IMPLEMENTING THE TOOL AND THE WAY THAT THE STATE OF WAS IMPLEMENTING IT AND ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES. FROM WHEN THE TOOL WAS ORIGINALLY IMPLEMENTED WAS THAT THE. DEVELOPER OF THE TOOL WAS HIGHLY INVOLVED IN THE TOOL AND SHE IS NO LONGER. INVOLVED WITH THE TOOLS OF THE THE IMPLEMENTATION IS ACTUALLY. I CHANGED OVER TIME SO I JUST WANT TO URGE THE LEGISLATURE. ON CALIFORNIA NOT TO GO DOWN THE SAME ROAD AS OF THE STATE OF MONTANA THANK YOU THE HUMAN. BY BILL CARTER. MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR IN NAPA COUNTY FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS IN A LITTLE OVER THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE CALIFORNIA. PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. TWENTY EIGHT CS CARD THE PROCESS IMPLEMENTED OUTCOME SYSTEM. THEY DID THINGS RIGHT THEY PUT TOGETHER A PERCENT OF EXPERTS TO LOOK AT THE FIELD BROADLY AND THEY SELECTED THE TOOLTHAT HAVE SCORED THE BEST AFTER THAT REVIEW. THEN INEXPLICABLY THEY CHOSE A SECOND TOOL THE CANS WHICH US SCORED POORLY IN THAT REVIEW AND IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. TOOLKIT TO IMPLEMENT. IN NAPA COUNTY THE KANSAS GONNA HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE IMPACT BOTH ON FUNDING AND STAFFING I BELIEVE IT MAY TAKE A FULL TIME. EQUIVALENT POSITION TO MANAGE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANS OF MY LITTLE TEENY SYSTEM THAT ONE POSITION THE BIG DEAL. AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO GET OUT OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO OKAY AND WHOSE. POSITION AT THE TIME OUR BUDGETS ARE CONTRACTING IN THE GONNA BE LEERY OF PROMISES THAT THE STATE'S GOING TO COVER THE COSTS OF THIS. IT'S ALSO A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES RIGHT NOW ACT A TOWN FAMILY ENTERING OUR SYSTEM. HAS A TO OUR INTAKE PROCESS AHEAD OF THEM BEFORE THEY GET TO SERVICES I CAN'T ADDS FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO AN HOUR TO THAT. MUCH LONGER THAN MANY OTHER ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO WE. HIM JUST INCREASE THE RISK THAT WE'VE WHERE FAMILIES OUT BEFORE THEY CAN THEY CAN GET TO TREATMENT. AND SIMILARLY WE HAVE SOME. CHILDREN IN SERVICES WHO. ARE GONNA HIT THEY RECEIVE MULTIPLE. APPLICATIONS OF THE CANCER IN THE YEAR GONNA SPEND MORE TIME DOING THE CANS AND THEY DO AND SERVICES THEMSELF. AND LASTLY THIS APPEARS TO BE A PROJECT THAT SET UP TO FAIL. WHEREAS TRAINING FOR SOME TOOLS CAN BE COMPLETED IN MINUTES THE KANSAS HOURS. WHEREAS APPLICATION OF OTHER TOOLS WITH CHILDREN AND FAMILIES CAN BE BRIEF THIS IS A VERY EXTENSIVE PROCESS. AT THE SAME TIME THAT. WERE DOING PROPOSING TO DO THIS AND MENTAL HEALTH CHILD WELFARE SERVICES ALL IS ALSO DOING THE CANS A CHILD WELFARE VERSION. SO A FOSTER CHILD WHOSE RECEIVING OUR CHILD AND RECEIVING A WELFARE SERVICES. AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IS GOING TO SIT THROUGH MULTIPLE ADMINISTRATIONS OF DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE SAME TOOL. OUT WHAT THE TIME OF WHAT THE KIND THAT COULD BE SPENT IN TREATMENT. AND THEN LASTLY WHEN YOU CHOOSE A TOOL THAT'S THIS COMPLICATED WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOURS OF TRAINING THE COMPLEXITY YOU AND INVOLVED IN ASSURING PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS WELL. THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO GET THE DATA THE FACT YOU'VE GOT TO ENTER THE UC DATE THAT THAT REALLY WAS NEVER DEVELOPED FOR AGGREGATE OUTCOMES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHEN YOU WORK TRYING TO COMEUP WITH A STRONG STATEWIDE EVALUATION YOU RUN A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF FAILING. SO I WANT TO. IT YOU IT POINT OUT THAT IN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NAPA. ADOPTED THE CANS. HOW WE FOUND IT TOO COMPLICATED AND WE FOUND WE DIDN'T GET INFORMATION OUT OF IT THAT? I WAS VALUABLE TO US IT'S A FINE TOOL FOR TREATMENT PLANNING. BUT IT'S NOT AN OUTCOME TOOL AND IT WAS NOT A GOOD FIT FOR NAPA COUNTY SO. I THINK THE SELECTION OF THE PEDIATRIC SYMPTOM CHECKLIST WAS A GOOD MOVE ANCHORED YOU TO STICK WITH THAT AND. THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANS THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON ADRIN CHILDREN WITH STEINBERG INSTITUTE FIRST WOULD JUST LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR EXCELLENT. RIGHT UP OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE BEEN RAISING. ABOUT THE D. H. SALES DECISION TO MANDATE THE CANS AS A AS A TOOL TO MEASURE ON OUTCOMES OF THE PS CITY FUNDED SERVICES. I'M THE MANDATE CONTAINED IN THE ENABLING LEGISLATION S. B. TEN OR NINE WAS TO SPECIFICALLY PRODUCE A STATEWIDE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM. AND A STEINBERG STEINBERG INSTITUTES CONCERNED THE REASON THAT WE'RE SO INVOLVED IN THIS POLICY DEBATE IS THE NEED TO PRODUCE VALID OUTCOMES. SO WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE SELECTION OF THE PEDIATRIC SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THIRTY FIVE AS A SINGLE TOOL TO BE USED IN THIS WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE UCLA EXPERTS ARE AUGUST TWENTY SEVENTEEN. REPORT THE PS EITHER IF I WAS THE ONLY TOOL TO MEET ALL OF THE MINIMUM CRITERIA AS DEVELOPED BY THE UCLA EXPERTS. AND SO IT REALLY IS THE BEST SUITED TOOL TO MONITOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLICLY FUNDED CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE SELECTING THE RIGHT MEASURE IS CRITICAL THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT THE KANSAS AN EXCELLENT ASSESSMENT TOOL. THAT IS USED BY MANY COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS BUT IT IS NOT AN OUTCOMES TOOL AND HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED AS SUCH. EXAMINING REPORTING OUT COMES IS A SIGNIFICANT AND ESSENTIAL UNDERTAKING AND MUST BE DONE RIGHT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. AND FUNDING THAT YOU KNOW IT'S FUNNY EMPLOYMENT CASE FUNDING IMPLEMENTATION OF IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TO DETERMINE OF PROGRAMS ARE WORKING OR NOT SO WE STRONGLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE TO RETURN RECONSIDER THIS DECISION AND TO ONLY FOCUS ON THE PS THE THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU ACUMEN. GOOD EVENING HOW I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE SAYING GOOD MORNING PRETTY DEFENDER WITHOUT AGAIN I'M DOCTOR LENTIL FROM THE CALIFORNIA LANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES I WAS ALSO A MEMBER ON THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM WHERE THIS TOOL WAS DEVELOPED. OR DID THIS DECISION WAS MADE. I'M I COULD RESPOND TO ALL THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE IT'S THEM. I HAVE STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT THEM BUT WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE THAT WITH DOCUMENTATION MULTIPLE SOURCES SO WE'LL MAKE SURE. THAT YOUR OFFICE GETS THOSE IKE WANTED TOUCH ON A COUPLE ITEMS. AND THE CANS IT'S MORE THAN JUST A PIECE OF PAPER THAT PEOPLE FILL OUT. IT IS AN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLANNING TOOL DESIGNED FOR A COLLABORATIVE COMMUNICATION TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL PERSPECTIVES OF THE CHILD ARE SEEN AT ONE TIME. AND SO AS YOU KNOW FROM WORKING WITH YOUR PATIENTS THERE'S SOMETIMES THAT A PARENT MAY SEE A CHILD IN A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LIGHT AND THE CHILD MAY ACT VERY DIFFERENT WITH PARENTS AND THEY DO AND SAY. THE SCHOOL SETTING SO THE KANSAS DESIGNS TO HAVE ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND GIVE ACCURATE RATINGS. OF THE CHILD ON AN ITEM BY ITEM BASIS. AT THE OTHER UNIQUE FEATURE OF THIS TOOL IS THAT ALSO INCLUDES STRENGTHS AND SO THERE AREN'T ANY TRADITIONAL CLINICAL TOOLS THAT LOOK AT THE STRENGTHS AND ITS. FAIRLY EASY ASSN PSYCHOLOGIST I KNOW IN A VERY CONTROLLED SETTING TO DECREASE SYMPTOMS IT'S NOT SO EASY TO IDENTIFY AND BUILD UP THE STRENGTHS. SO MUCH YOU BUILD UP THE STRENGTH YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LASTING DIFFERENCE FOR THAT CHILD WERE THAT FAMILY SO THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. HE REPORTS THAT OF THE MANY MEMBERS IN FRONT OF ME OR DISCUSSING IS NOT A PEER REVIEWED REPORTS. AND THAT SINGLE. OPINION FROM A SINGLE PROFESSOR UCD THAT'S NOT A PEER REVIEWED OPINION THERE ARE MULTIPLE CARE REVIEWED REPORTS. THAT ARE DONE NATIONALLY THE MOST RECENT BY DUKE UNIVERSITY THAT SAYS THE CANS IS HIGHLY RATED. AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. AND AS FAR AS AGGREGATING UP A MANY OF SPEAKERS THAT IT'S OKAY TO IDENTIFY THE OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN WELL IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY. FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD THAT INFORMATION CAN BE AGGREGATED UP. TO GIVE YOU FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES ON A PROGRAM LEVEL IN A STATEWIDE LEVEL SO IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE THAT SOME OF THE FOLKS IN PREMIER SANG. IT'S OKAY ON THE INDIVIDUAL LETTERS LEVEL TO TELL YOU THAT KIDS ARE GETTING BETTER BUT NOT ON A GROUP LEVEL. AND IT ALSO THAT THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER THIS IS A PUBLIC DOMAIN TOOL. SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH IMPLEMENTATION THAT THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IS BECAUSE OF POOR IMPLEMENTATION IMPORTER TRAINING NOT THE TOOL ITSELF AND SO THAT'S THE REASON D. H. YES IT'S TAKING A LOT OF TIMEAND ATTENTION. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CLINICIANS IN THE COUNTIES AREREADY AND PROVIDED WITH ADEQUATE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL THE WAY IT WAS DESIGNED. AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME. ADD THIS TOOL IT'S NICE THAT IS BOTH AN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT PLANNING TOOL BECAUSE IT'S DONE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND MEETS ALL THE. MEDICAID REQUIREMENTS FOR. PERSON CENTERED PLANNING HOW WHICH REMOVING TO AND HOLLER SYSTEMS OF CARE WHICH CAN BE DONE ALL AT ONCE SO YOU'RE NOT HAVING TO DO A SEPARATE PROCESS IT IS THE PROCESS IT REPLACES THAT PROCESS. AND THEREFORE IT IS AN EP STT REP REIMBURSABLE PROGRAMS ALL THESE HOURS THAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. CANDY FUNDED BY EPS DUTY EXCEPT THE UP FRONT TRAINING. AND. IT IS USE STATEWIDE IN MORE THAN. FORTY STATE OF STATES I THINK AT THIS POINT. AND SO SOME OF THE STATE THAT WERE REFERENCED WE'RE DONE YEARS AND YEARS AGO WHEN THE. TOOL WAS VERY NEW AND THEY HADN'T GONE THROUGH THE TRIAL AND ERROR PROCESS. SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOUR OFFICE AND TALKED TO YOU MORE ABOUT THIS IN DETAIL. I ONE LAST THING I DO WANNA SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SAT DIRECTOR CAN'T SAID AT THE VERY BEGINNING. THAT. MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT THAT IS TO IN ADULTS BUT NOT IN THE CHILDREN SYSTEM. THE CHILDREN'S ITEM SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA IS MUCH BROADER AND DEEPER AND SO IT'S KIDS CAN HAVE A VERY VERY MILD NEED. AND STILL MEET SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE CRICKETER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT BACK UP TO THE. YES SIR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. IF YOU'VE MADE A PUBLIC COMMENT. ONCE ALL PROBABLY THAT THEY'RE IF IT'S OKAY JUST BECAUSE WE'RE APPROACHING SEVEN. I DON'T. NORMALLY LIMIT. IT'S. OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE NOT. APPARENTLY CAME TO A CONCLUSION. DUE TO THE. DIFFERENCES IN OPINION THAT WE HEARD DURING PUBLIC COMMENT AND WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT AGAIN WHAT. OUR THOUGHT PROCESS WAS. BEHIND THE USE OF KANSAS AN OUTCOME BASED. METRIC WHEN IT APPEARS THAT. THE. ORGANIZATION THAT WE HIRED TO HELP US HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO VALIDATE THE OUTCOMES. BEFORE US. I MEAN I'LL DO IT I'LL LET BRENDA CHINA AS WELL AND BECAUSE IT IS. SEVEN AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A PSYCHOMETRIC LEAVE VALID DATA SHARING DISCUSSION. PROBABLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME. THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS. ASIDE FROM THE PSC YOU UCLA LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF TOOLS AND NONE OF THEM OBVIOUSLY STOOD OUT. IN AND THEY ALL HAD THEIR FLAWS THEY ALL HAD THEIR BENEFITS. AS BRENDA SAID. WE HAD TRIED TO USE A DIFFERENT TOOL YEARS AGO AND THAT KIND OF STUFF COLLAPSED IN ITS OWN. WAIT IN TERMS OF. I THINK IT WAS EITHER DIFFICULT OR TIMELY IT WAS OBVIOUSLY EXPENSIVE. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS. THE FACT THAT A LOT OF. COUNTIES ARE ALREADY USING THIS TOOL. FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PLANTS WAS CERTAINLY ONE. THING FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT COUNTIES WERE FAMILIAR WITH IT WE ALSO HAVE A SISTER DEPARTMENT THAT WAS NEEDING TO LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A TOOL AS IT PERTAINS TO. THEIR CONTAINMENT CARE REFORM AND THEIR CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS I'M OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T MAKE A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE AS TO DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT. TOOLS. I WOULD. TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT. POINT OF PRIVILEGE AND SAY IT IS. CLEAR FROM BOTH DEPARTMENTS WHEN WE HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE ABOUT USING HANDS ON CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. THAT I'M IF AN ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN DONE BY EITHER THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE OR BY THE HEALTHCARE SIDE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON CLEAR GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW THOSE DATA. POINTS ARE SHARED SO THAT YOU ARE ASSESSED SEEN. UNNECESSARILY AND WE'RE CERTAINLY MINDFUL OF THAT. I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING AROUND. OUR CONSIDERATION AROUND THE TIME IT TAKES THE EFFICACY CERTAINLY IT'S A PUBLIC. OPEN ARCHITECTURE IS. DOCTOR FOLLOWS JUST SAYING SO WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT POINTS OF CONSIDERATION AND THAT I THINK. IT'S SIMPLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT THERE'S NOT ONE CLEAR. CHOICE OTHER THAN THE PSE BUT WE ALSO FELT REALLY STRONGLY THAT. THAT'S A PARENT PERSPECTIVE AND TIME AGAIN AS DOCTORS ALL SAID THERE'S OTHER I'M PERSPECTIVES THAT WE NEED AND WANT TO CAPTURE PARENTS ARE CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT. VOICES AND THEY KNOW THEIR CHILDREN BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE BUT THERE'S ALSO. CLINICIANS AND OTHERS THAT WE BELIEVE NEED TO BE. BOTH PUTTING AND DATA AS WELL AS HAVING US EVALUATE THAT AND SO. THERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET. THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR. WE HAVE NOT. MODIFIED OR CHANGED THE PROPOSAL THERE'S APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR TRAINING. FOR COUNTY STAFF BOTH ON THE EIGHTEEN THE PROGRAMMATIC SIDE THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED SO THAT COUNTIES ARE FUNDED FORTHESE ACTIVITIES. AND SO. WE BELIEVE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE. IMPLEMENT. WE HAVE A DATE BY WHICH COUNTIES HAVE TO BE PROVIDING DATA TO US. IN RECOGNITION OF SOME OF THE. CONCERNS WE. LAGGED LA TO THE START OF THE NEW YEAR SO JANUARY. SO WE HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS WE CAN WE FEEL TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH CHOOSING A TOOL AND CHOOSE AN IMPLEMENTATION. AND THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT. WE'D ORIGINALLY WANTED CHILDREN ASSESSED EVERY NINETY DAYS. AND WE. MODIFY THAT TO EVERY SIX MONTHS. WHICH WAS ALSO IN RECOGNITION OF BOTH THE CLINICIAN. TIME AND EFFORT AS WELL AS MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS WERE OVERLY ASSASSIN SO YOU KNOW WE FEEL I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE DECISION AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT. IF WE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN ANY OTHER TOOL YOU WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SIDE OF OF POPULATION BUT WE FEEL THAT WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE. PROPOSING TO DO. I'M. IS THERE ARE THERE ANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM MONTANA. I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT MONTANA. OTHER THAN I JUST HEARD IT. AND SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT NINTENDO WAS USING IT FOR IT DEPENDS ON A LOT OF THINGS AND I THINK AGAIN. AND WE CAN LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT STATES AND SAY YOU KNOW WHICH SCHOOL DID YOU USE WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THIS PURPOSE ABOUT PURPOSE HOW DID YOU FIND IT HOW DID YOU USE THAT. WHAT WAS THAT MANDATE INVOLVED I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HOW I COULD REACTED MONTANA? I'M. IT I THINK YOU'RE SEEING MY HESITATION TO. GO FORWARD WITHOUT FEELING AS IF THERE'S A A. CLEAR PLAN BEFORE US THAT UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED EVEN BY MEMBERS OF THE TASK FORCE THAT WERE MEANT TO BE PUT TOGETHER THAT YOU HAVE. SEVERAL MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES AND SO I'M. DONE THAT EXPRESSING MY HESITATION AND. WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH A. THE STAKEHOLDERS HERE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE SOME RESOLUTION WE CAN COME TO. BUT WE WILL HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN FOR NOW AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTEEN. OKAY SO. VERY QUICKLY. WE ARE SEEKING. TEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF TEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FOR. SEVERAL DIFFERENT ITEMS THAT ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. THERE'S FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT LAST YEAR THAT WAS ACTION DOLLARS SO THAT FUNDING WAS GIVEN TO US BUT THAT POSITION AUTHORITY WAS NOT SO. FOUR OF THOSE ARE JUST LITERALLY NOT ADDITIONAL MONEY BUT JUST GIVING US THE POSITION AUTHORITY. THERE ARE STAFF THAT HER ON THE INSIDE AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE. FIVE A ONE BY A MISTER RIDLEY THOMAS. AS WELL AS. FUNDING FOR OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT OF THE FEDERAL MANAGED CARE RULE. SO THE. GENERAL OVERALL REQUEST IS FOR TEN PERMANENT POSITIONS IN YOUR AGENDA DID A REALLY NICE JOB OF LAYING IT OUT THE ONE QUESTION THAT WE WERE ASKED TO RESPOND WITH WHICH. WAS YOU KNOW FOR WHAT REASON ITS IMAGE AS A STATE ADMIN FUNDING NOT PROPOSE FOR PART OF THAT IS. NONE OF THESE ITEMS THAT WE ARE SEEKING ARE USING MHSAA FUNDING OTHER THAN WHAT WAS FUNDED LAST YEAR IN THE BUDGET FOR THE. FOR POSITION SO WE JUST NEED AUTHORITY FOR SO THE REST OF THIS IS NOT RELATED TO MHSAA SO THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT PROPOSED. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE FIFTEEN. KRISTIN BARLOWE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STAFF AND PERMANENCY FOR THE STAFF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN OUR ARENA THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. GOOD EVENING CHAIR MEMBERS VERY MUCH DATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES ECHOING CBO CHEESE COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. EGGMAN. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIXTEEN. SURE SO THIS IS A BILL. AUTHORED BY SENATOR MITCHELL. LAST YEAR S. B. THREE TWO THREE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MORE. COMPLICATED ISSUES FOR US TO. SORT OUT IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH ARE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. THAT ARE SEEKING TO PROVIDE I'M SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT SERVICES OR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THE POSITIONS ARE. BOTH PROGRAMMATIC AS WELL AS STAFF SEEN OUR AUDITS AND INVESTIGATIONS SIDE THAT SETS ALL OF THAT PPS SCOPE OF SERVICE. RATES FOR THE SERVICES AND SO IT'S I'M FIVE PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AS WELL AS SOME EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY EQUIVALENT TO TWENTY ONE POSITIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE DIFFERENT CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPILL. AND BUT DEFERRED TO MY COLLEAGUES OF FINANCE IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE THAT I MISSED ON THE US DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELIA. PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE SIXTEEN. KRISTIN BARLOWE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WE WERE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEGISLATION THAT I PUT THEM IN THIS PREDICAMENT AND SO CERTAINLY WOULDSUPPORT THEM GETTING THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO PUT IT INTO PLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVENTY. SO. LAST AND I'M SORRY THAT DOCTOR WOOD IS NO LONGER WITH US BUT OUT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE WHICH WAS NO LONGER MECHANISM HE'S STILL WITH US WELL RIGHT I'M SORRY HE IS NO LONGER PHYSICALLY WITH US IN THIS ROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE. CLARIFICATION. SO. THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A BILLABLE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED BY A MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS WITHIN AN FQHC RHC. THIS. JUST AS AN ADDENDUM TO AND DISH IN THE. REQUEST FOR STAFFING THAT WE BELIEVE ALSO BECOMING AND AS A RESULT OF. CLINICS NEEDING TO CHANGE THEIR I'M SCOPE OF SERVICE REQUEST TO ALLOW FOR THIS NEW BILLABLE PROVIDER IS. THERE'S AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND THE AGENDA AROUND THE SUBMISSION OF THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT WHICH WE SUBMITTED ON. ON FRIDAY MARCH THIRTY FIRST I BELIEVE. IT WAS. IT IT IT BOTH NOT ONLY ADDS THAT ENOUGH T. AS A BILLABLE PROVIDER BUT IT ALSO HAD OTHER. COMPLIMENTS RELATED TO FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AND SO WE WILL BE WAITING TO HEAR FROM CMS ON THE SUBMISSION OF THAT STATE PLAN AMENDMENT IF THERE'S QUESTIONS OR ANYTHING. BUT THIS IS SEEKING TO ESSENTIALLY. BE PREPARED FOR THE WORKLOAD THAT WE ANTICIPATE THAT WILL BE COMING AND AS CLINICS. SEEK TO PUT THESE BILLABLE PROVIDERS AND. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER. WELL. OF BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA L. I WOULD JUST QUICKLY NOTE THAT WE'VE REVIEWED ALL THE BCP'S THAT THE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS SUBMITTED THIS YEAR AND THAT OTHER THAN THIS ONE WHICH WE HAVE NO ISSUES WITH ANY OF THEM. HOWEVER ON THIS PROPOSAL WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A LIMITED TERM. RESOURCES AND POSITION AUTHORITY BUT ONLY FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN OF THE. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY RESOURCES ARE ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RESOURCES A HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF OUT WHAT THE DEMAND IS GOING TO BE FOR THE SCOPE OF SERVICE REQUESTS. OUT WHEN THIS WHEN THE SPA WILL ULTIMATELY BE APPROVED AND SO WE FEEL THAT AFTER WE HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WILL HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW MANY HOW MUCH OF NEW AUDIT RESOURCES THE DEPARTMENT WOULD NEED AND THAT THE DECISION COULD BE MADE AT THAT. TIME. WE'D JUST FINALLY NOTE THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T PLAN ON HIRING ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL STAFF UNTIL STARTING IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. SO ARE APPROVING THE RESOURCES AND ANTICIPATION THAT BUDGET ARM COULD DOES MAKE SENSE. TOYOTA HUMPHRIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOU KNOW WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO WENT TO INCLUDE FUNDING THROUGH NINETEEN TWENTY AS TO ESTIMATED LEVEL OF RESOURCES IT IS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE BILL. GIVEN THAT WORKLOAD IS EXPECTED TO MATERIALIZE STARTING ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY AND NINETEEN THERE WOULD BE LIMITED DATA. BASED ON A FEW MONTHS OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE TO DEVELOP A SPRING PROPOSAL IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET SO REACHED ONE MAGNOTTA THOUGHT. AND NOT AS YOU AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONS THAT THEY HAVE SUBMITTED THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT SO. REPUBLICAN ANTWONE ISSUE SEVENTEEN. KIRSTEN BARLOW ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE VIEW THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CARE CENTERS AND RURAL HEALTH CARE CLINICS IT'S IMPORTANT PARTS OF OUR HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET COMMUNITIES. MANY OF WHOM DO OFFER MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES SO TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THIS BILL AND GET THE MFT IS AS BILL PROVIDERS OF IMPORTANT THING THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL KEEP ISSUE SEVENTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO FISH YOU EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU DIRECTOR THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. HE CURLED THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE OF CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES. IT'S LATE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF FISH. BUT WILL IT WE'RE ASKING FOR IT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR. APPROPRIATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND IN SUPPORT OF IMPLEMENTATION OF AB TWELVE NINETY NINE AB TOLD MY NINE MISTER RIDLEY THOMAS IS BILL FROM YEAR TO AGO. IN THE. ANSWER REALLY. A DIFFICULT QUESTION AND ACTUALLY SOLVE THE TWENTY THREE YEAR OLD PROBLEM WHICH IS THE PROBLEM. OF YOU WHEN CHILDREN OR YOUTH ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE AND THEN PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR COUNTIES ORIGINAL JURISDICTION THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME GETTING. DE GETTING. BUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET A SERVICES AT ALL WHEN THEY GET SERVICES THERE MARK MORE LIKELY GET FEWER SERVICES AND NOT AS INTENSIVE. SO THAT WAS THE ISSUE AND AND WHAT IT REALLY CAME DOWN TO AS WELL WHEN A YOUNG PERSON'S PLACE THAT A COUNTY. OR ALSO PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR MENTAL HEALTH PLAN WHICH MAKES IT VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH PLAN THAT TO A RANGERS ARE EITHER PROVIDER RANGE OF SERVICES. AND WHAT WILL THEY NINE DID VERY SIMPLY WILL SHIFT THE RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE COUNTY OF JURISDICTION. TO THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE AND SAID OKAY WHERE YOU'RE LIVING IS THE COUNTY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE THEN FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE. THE FUNDING THEN FOLLOWS THE YOUTH THROUGH. THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. THE PROBLEM THE COUNTIES RUN INTO IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT A THREE YEAR LAG BEFORE THEY START TO SEE THOSE FUNDS THAT THEY HAVE TO PUT OUT IN YEAR ONE AND. THEY START TO SEE THOSE FUNDS ARE TO SHOW UP IN THEIR ALLOCATION YOUR THREE. PARTICULARLY A IMPACTED BY THIS OR COUNTIES WHERE THERE EITHER A LARGE NUMBER OF OF SD RTP SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC OF PROGRAMS. WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF OF THAT OF RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES WHO RELIED CAN ARE EVER LET KIDS GO OUT OF THE AT AND ABOUT OF COUNTY CARE? THOSE KIDS MAY HAVE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT TO MIDDLE HEALTH NEEDS. WHAT PRO THE PROBLEM THAT IT POSES A CASH FLOW PROBLEM IT'S A IT'S A? IT'S A AS A TEMPORARY CASH FLOW PROBLEM. BUT IT'S A REALLY ACUTE CRITICAL CASUAL PROBLEM FOR THIS COUNTIES. WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT ARE WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS BASICALLY A THAT ACOSTA POOL BE ESTABLISHED A THREE YEAR BECAUSE POLL? ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO COVER THOSE UPFRONT COSTS. IF WE FIGURE IT'S PROBABLY BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. WHICH COMES OUT OF THE. THE DCS POS DATA AND IT COMES OUT OF. FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT DATA IS THAT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I SORT OF UP FRONT BEFORE IT STARTS TO CATCH UP. AND THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS STATE FUNDS TO EVER COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN I'M SO WE THINK THAT IF THE STATE PUTS UP THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. ASIDE THEN IN THOSE FOR THOSE THREE YEARS ONE TWO THREE BUT PUT IT UP FRONT THE SEVENTY FIVE TO BE HELD US BECAUSE PEOPLE. THAT BY THE END OF THOSE THREE YEARS THING SHOULD BE FAIRLY WELL A SQUARED AWAY. THERE'S THAT THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEN THAT SHOULD BE PAID BACK. AND AND I THINK TO THE IS THAT THE ANSWER THAT'S WORRIED WHERE AGNOSTIC ON THAT. IF INDEED. WE SEE KIDS ARE GETTING SERVE TO ARTS ARE BEFORE IF THEY'RE GETTING THAT ME MORE INTENSIVE SERVICES ARE MORE SERVICES AND AS YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE'RE SAYING NOW. THEN IT MAKES SENSE THAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL MONEY THE COUNTIES WERE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TO SPEND SHOULD BE PAID BACK. UP ON THE OTHER HAND IF IN FACT NOTHING CHANGES THAT IS TO SAY WE GET BASICALLY FLAT. YOU KNOW FLAT. PROVISION OF SERVICE ARE FLAT THAT EXPENDITURE OF DOLLARS INFUSION SERVICES THAT MAKE SENSE IT WOULD BE PAID BACK. THREE ASKING FOR THAT THE COST POOL AND TO BE WORKED OUT BETWEEN PART OF FINANCE AND THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS. SIR. ROTH. CHRIS UMBRELLA ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. BUT WE DO WILL CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE SPONSOR OF THE LEGISLATION AB TWELVE NINETY NINE IS THINKING OF US. AND IN TERMS OF THE COUNTY'S PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO ARE THE RECEIVERS OF OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENT SOME OF THEM ARE SMALLER. AND MEDIUM SIZE COUNTIES THAT DEBT DEFINITELY WILL WILL FEEL I AM A CASH FLOW CRUNCH TO THAT AND WE'VE TRIED TO CREATIVELY IDENTIFY A METHOD WITHIN COUNTY LAND. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I'M A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ESTABLISHED A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY OR A GPA. I'M CALLED CAL MESA THAT. ENTITY DOES HAVE EXPERIENCE. BASED ON THE ADMINISTRATING COMPANY THAT THEIR AFFILIATED WITH AND SETTING UP BANKING PULLS FOR JUST THIS KIND OF SITUATION. IT'S OUR SENSE THAT AB TWELVE NINETY NINE MAY OR MAY NOT RESULT IN INCREASED. SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NEEDS. STATEWIDE BUT MORE SO THAT THAT NEED IS BEING TRANSFERRED FROM ONE COMMUNITY TO THE NEXT AND SO AND WE WOULD CERTAINLY NEVER TURN DOWN THE STATE GENERAL FUND DOLLAR. TO ADDRESS OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT THE FACT THAT IT'S DESCRIBED REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE REPAID OVER TIME. OR ESSENTIALLY ALONE AND MAKE SAID IN SOMEWHAT LESS ATTRACTIVE. AND SO JUST HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE THE BANKING PULL THAT COUNTIES ARE TRYING TO HAVE SET UP WHEREIN. EACH COUNTY WOULD ESSENTIALLY I'M WITH THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS APPROVAL CONTRIBUTE SOME LEVEL OF FUNDING COUNTIES THAT ARE RECEIVING COUNTIES COULD MAKE WITHDRAWALS. AGAINST THOSE FUNDS ROUND THEIR PARTNER COUNTIES UMF MANY OF WHOM IT'S IT'S A FAIRLY. ESTABLISHED PATTERN THAT A NUMBER OF TOGETHER COUNTIES ARE BIG CENTERS AND BIG COW ANOTHER SET OF COUNTIES BEING BIG RECEIVERS AND SO UMPIRE JOHN JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY IS WORKING. AND DOING A LOT OF OUTREACH TO THE COUNTIES THAT ARE REALLY MOST IMPACTED IN EITHER AS A RECEIVER OR SENATOR TYPE OF COUNTY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE EIGHTEEN. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIR AGAIN FAIR ADVOCATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES THIS WORD IS BEEN USED SEVERAL TIMES BUT WE ARE AGNOSTIC US TO THE SOLUTION. FOR COUNTIES IN THE SITUATION WE APPRECIATE THE ALLIANCE'S ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AS WELL THE CAL MESA SOLUTION WHICH IS A COUNTY OPT IN. A CONCEPT OUT WE ARE MONITORING THE ISSUE AND WE WELCOME ANY HELPTHAT COUNTIES CAN GET FOR. ADJUSTING TO THE TWELVE NINETY NINE POLICY CHANGE LASTLY JUST WANNA PUT IN A NOTE THAT COUNTY STRONGLY SUPPORTED AB TWELVE NINETY NINE SO FIGURING OUT HOW TO MAKE THE MONEY FLOW IS A PRIORITY. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS MARIE COLLINS WITH CASA PACIFICA ARM I JUST WANT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS FROM BUDGET REQUEST IT IS SOME UNITS YOU THAT'S AFFECTING US IN VENTURA COUNTY. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT TWELVE NINETY NINE AND THE WHOLE CONCEPT FOR ANY CHILD LET ALONE A FOSTER CHILD BUT THE MONEY FOLLOWS THE YOUTH TO WHERE THEY NEED TO RECEIVE SERVICES OBVIOUSLY. A NO BRAINER AND NOTHING THAT ANYONE IN THIS ROOM WOULD DISAGREE WITH. BUT IT BUT IT I DON'T EVEN PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND REALIGNMENT IN ALL OF THIS CRAZY STATE FUNDING YES BUT. THE REALITY IS THERE IS A LAG AT THIS POINT IN TIME AND THERE IS THERE ARE ON THERE ARE PRESSURES BEING PUT UPON. AND KIDS NEED THE SERVICES AND THEY NEED TO RECEIVE THE SERVICES WHEREVER THEY MAY BE IN THE STATE AND SO THERE MAY BE KID FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY OR FRESNO COUNTY WHERE LA COUNTY COME THAT NEED THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE OUR COUNTY AND. THIS SHOULDN'T BE A BARRIER TO THEM RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED SO I HOPE YOU CONSIDER THE REQUEST THANK YOU MAKE HIM. THE UNDERCUT CARBON THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF COMMUNITY BEAVER HEALTH AGENCIES I'M TRUSTING THAT BACKWARDS. I. WE SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S A PRACTICAL SOLUTION HELPING ACHIEVE THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF AB TWELVE. WE CAN. I KILLERS REPRESENTING A SPARE ENOUGH ONE OF THE LARGEST FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES IN THE STATE PROVIDING SERVICES TO NEARLY THREE THOUSAND YEAR. AND THAT'S PROPOSAL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANCIA I'M OURSELVES AND OUR OTHER FELLOW FFA IS AS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS OF CCR. AND GETTING TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICES AND FOR KIDS IN OUR CARE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DO IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SIR AS WHERE STEPPING DOWN YOUTH FROM ASK YOUR KEY PIECE THAN GIVING HIM AND TO YOU OUR. FAMILY HOMES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THEM SAID THE ABILITY TO BE. FUNDED AND NOT RISK NOT GOING REIMBURSED FOR SERVICES THAT YOU'RE PROVIDING AS I CAN BE A CHALLENGE FOR PROVIDERS TO FLOAT THAT. KIND OF RESOURCES THAT WERE THREE YEAR PERIOD OF WAITING FOR REIMBURSEMENT AND SO. APPEAL GIVE THEM SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE THANK YOU. WE CAN. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT TO BRING IT UP THE DYESS AND. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR FINANCE AND I GET MYSELF IN TROUBLE FOR BRAINSTORMING ON THE DYESS. BUT THE IT IT'S NOT LOST ON ME THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HERE AND IT WAS EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF INTEREST. THAT WAS ON COUNTY FUNDS. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO USE THOSE FUNDS AS A PLACEHOLDER. UNTIL THE COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO. REPAY AS THEY HAVE SUGGESTED HERE TODAY. BEEN FOR THE GENOCIDE CARE THANK YOU CHAIR OF CHRIS COOK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I THINK GENERALLY THE THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SUPPORT. THE AUGMENTATION OF THE SEVEN FIVE MILLION. AND AS WE'VE HEARD. DELUDE SPIN DIRECTION GIVEN TO THE COUNTIES ON HOW TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND IT WAS IT'S OUR HOPE THAT IT. BUT THEY'LL FIND WAYS IN HOW TO. COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE COUNTIES AND AND MAKING IT WORK WITHIN THEIR OWN. CASH FLOW. AND I MIGHT JUST NOTE THAT THE EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IS MHSAA FUNDING THAT AT LEAST WITH HOW I THINK DIRECTOR KENT'S CHARACTERIZED THAT. SHE WOULD ENVISION USING IT AND SORT OF A SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACT THE FUNDING. THE INTEREST WHAT KIND OF A CREW TO THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS. THAT IT'S FUNDED THAT THAT AT THAT FUNDING IS FROM SO IT WOULD GO TO IT THE PREVENT AND FAN EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES OR THE INNOVATION FUNDING WHICH. THIS PROBABLY WOULDN'T QUALIFY UNDER THAT WAS GENERAL SERVICE LABELS. COM. FINAL QUESTION IS YOU HAVE MENTIONED FEDERAL MATCHING OR COMPONENT OF THIS CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT FURTHER SO WHEN THE. WHEN THE CHILDREN AT WHEN THAT WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE BILLED. IT'S A MEDICAL SERVICE MEDICAL BILLABLE SERVICE AND SO THE THE SHARING RATIO FEDERAL SHARING RATIO ON THAT'S FIFTY PERCENT. SO WHAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED IS IS BASICALLY THAT ALL THE MONEY GOES OUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THEN THEY GET REIMBURSED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT A FIFTY PERCENT. IS SO THE THE THAT THE TWENTY FIVE YOU KNOW THAT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WOULD BE THAT THE LOCAL SHARE IN ANTICIPATION THE FEDERAL SHARE WHICH USUALLY COMES BACK PRETTY QUICKLY. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHTEEN OPEN AND THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING HERE TODAY THIS WILL CONCLUDE TODAY SOMEONE HERE
