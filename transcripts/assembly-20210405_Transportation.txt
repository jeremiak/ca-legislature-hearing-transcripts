BEFORE WE GET STARTED I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE FORMER SENATE PRO TEM GAINES MILLS WHO PASSED AWAY ON MARCH TWENTY SEVENTH AT THE AGE OF NINETY THREE. PROTERRA MILLS WITH WAS A CHAMPION OF PUBLIC TRANSIT WHICH IS WHY WE ARE MENTIONING HIM HERE TODAY. HE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT ACT WHICH IS THE MAIN LOCAL FUNDING SOURCE OF PUBLIC TRANSIT ACROSS THE STATE. HE AUTHORED LEGISLATION CREATING THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT BOARD. RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE TROLLEY LIGHT RAIL SYSTEM IN SAN DIEGO. THAT HAS BECOME THE BLUEPRINT FOR LIGHT RAIL ACROSS THE US. AFTER TWENTY TWO YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HE WENT ON TO CHAIR THE METROPOLITAN TRANSIT DEVELOPMENT BOARD SERVED ON THE AMTRAK BOARD AND MOST RECENTLY SERVED ON THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. HE IS SURVIVED BY HIS TWO DAUGHTERS SON AND NINE GRANDCHILDREN. HIS FAMILY HAS ASKED PEOPLE TO TAKE A RIDE ON THE TROLLEY A TRAIN OR ON A BIKE IN HIS MEMORY. WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN OUR HEARING SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FRIEDMAN HERE FALL HERE BERMAN. CUNNINGHAM DALY.% DAVIES GIPSON- KALRA. WE MEDINA. NAZARIAN WHEN. O'DONNELL WARD. WICKS. DO WE HAVE A QUORUM YET. YES OKAY WE DO HAVE A FARM DO I HAVE A MOTION FOR THE CONSENT FILE. HEY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FRIEDMAN YES FONG. BERMAN CUNNINGHAM. DALY DAVIES. GIPSON OUR KALRA. WE ARE MEDINA. THIS AREA. TWENTY O'DONNELL. BOARD WICKS. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON I WANT TO NOTE THAT AB SEVEN NINETY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAMOS WAS NOTICED IN THE DAILY FILE BUT WILL NOT BE HEARD TODAY IT WILL BE HEARD AT A LATER HEARING WE HAVE FIVE BILLS TO DISCUSS TODAY A. B. NINE SEVENTEEN AB ONE SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR AB FIFTEEN OH THREE MAYBE ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WE HAVE OUR FIRST AUTHOR ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. I WOULD INVITE YOU AT YOUR WHEN YOU'RE READY TO OPEN ON THE BILL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- WHAT BETTER WAY TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF SENATOR MILLS AND WITH A TRANSIT FRIENDLY BILL WHICH AB NINE SEVENTEEN CERTAINLY AS IT WILL. EXPANSIVE LAW TO ALLOW TRANSIT AGENCIES TO CAPTURE IMAGES OF VEHICLES. VIOLATING TRANSIT ONLY LANES AND BLOCKING BUS STOPS. BUS ONLY LANES OF COURSE ARE AN IMPORTANT TRANSIT INFRASTRUCTURE YET DESPITE CLEAR MARKINGS AND SIGNAGE. THESE LANES ARE FREQUENTLY IGNORED. FOR EXAMPLE FIELD OBSERVATIONS OF WILSHIRE BOULEVARD IN WEST LOS ANGELES AND MY DISTRICT FOUND ONE VIOLATION EVERY FOUR MINUTES. BUS ONLY LANE VIOLATIONS AND PARKED VEHICLES CAUSE DELAYS AND POSE SAFETY ISSUES TO RIDERS TRANSIT OPERATORS ARE FORCED TO MANEUVER AROUND CONGESTED LANES AND MAKE DROP OFFS FURTHER FROM THE CURB. CAMERA ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN SAN FRANCISCO ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY TO DETER DRIVERS FROM IMPEDING RELIABLE SERVICE. FORWARD FACING CAMERAS ARE TESTS OF THE BUSES AND ONLY RECORD LICENSE PLATES OF VEHICLES BLOCKING BUS LANES IMAGES ARE THEN SENT TO THE LOCAL ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO REVIEW AND ISSUE A CITATION IF NEEDED. THESE CAMERA ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN VIOLATIONS AND DECREASE VARIABILITY AND TRAVEL TIMES IN JUST THEIR PILOT PHASE SAN FRANCISCO SHOWED A 20% REDUCTION IN DELAYS AND EVEN FEWER REPEAT VIOLATORS. IN ALAMEDA AND CONTRA COSTA COUNTY AC TRANSIT SAW 21% INCREASE IN ON TIME PERFORMANCE. THE CAMERA ENFORCEMENT WORKS IN THIS SETTING AND IT'S COST EFFECTIVE AND IDEAL FOR BUSY STREETS WHERE PARKING IS ENFORCEMENT IS NOT REALISTIC. AB NINE SEVENTEEN WILL PROVIDE RIDERS WITH ACCESS TO SAFE AND RAPID BUS SERVICE AND ENSURE PUBLIC TRANSIT REMAINS COMPETITIVE IN ATTRACTING MORE RIDERS. I WANT TO NOTE THAT- I'LL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO REMOVE THE WORK STATIONS FROM THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL THERE WERE CONCERNS THAT ENFORCEMENT TRANSIT STATIONS WOULD INCLUDE PARKING LOTS AND THAT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION WE'RE GOING TO THEREFORE AMEND THE BILL IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL- WE HAVE DESIREE JONES A SENIOR MANAGER OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AT L. A. METRO AND CLAUDIA BURGERS DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS AT AC TRANSIT. THANK YOU- OPERATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN YOU BRING US- THE WITNESSES I THINK DESIREE JONES WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST YOU CAN FIND DESIREE JONES FOR US. YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR HEARING EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN TODAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOW FOR OFFERING THE BILL I'M DESIREE JOHN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY OR L. A. METRO EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN WOULD AUTHORIZE PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES AT ALL FRONT FACING CAMERAS ON ITS TRANSIT VEHICLE DISTRICTS WOULD ENFORCEMENT OF PARKING VIOLATIONS IN TRANSIT ONLY LANES. AND AT BUS STOPS WITH THIS IS DORIE METRO AND OTHER TRANSIT AGENCIES CAN PARTNER WITH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE PARKING ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IN LA COUNTY AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE METRO SPONSORING EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN TO AUTHORIZE THE DEPLOYMENT OF THE TRANSIT LANE ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITIES OF LOS ANGELES AND SANTA MONICA HERE IN L. A. COUNTY WHERE WE OPERATE OVER TWENTY NINE MILES OF EXISTING BUSTLING. AND THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR FUTURE EXPANSION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER CITIES IN LA COUNTY AND METRO BUS RAPID. TRANSIT LANE NETWORK GROWS. METRO CURRENT SERVES THE TEN READ IN AT LAKE. A MAJORITY WHICH ARE IN THE OF LA. DURING THE PANDEMIC WE CONTINUE TO SERVE OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND WRITERS PER DAY WITH 75% OF OUR RIDERSHIP ON BUDGET. MEASURE WILL EXPAND OUR NET NETWORK TO OVER A HUNDRED MILES IN THE NEXT DECADE DECADE. IMPROVING SPEED AND RELIABILITY OF OUR BUS NETWORK YOU EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN IS ESSENTIAL TO MOVING MORE PEOPLE I'M TRANSIT BUSES INCREASE MOBILITY. AND ULTIMATELY REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. ILLEGALLY PARKED CARS IN BOTH LANES IS A SAFETY HAZARD EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN WILL HELP BUT HIS TO OPERATE FASTER AND MORE SAFELY. FOR EXAMPLE A SINGLE CAR THAT THE LEGALLY PARKED IN A BUCKLEY OF EIGHTY BUCKS RIGHT WRITERS ARE DELAYED EACH MINUTE WE'RE TALKING FIVE THOUSAND RIDERS DELETE IN THE HOUR. BEFORE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ABLE TO CLEAR THE BUS PLANE FOR SERVICE. WE JUST WANT TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF SAN FRANCISCO AND EIGHTY TRANSIT PROGRAM- THAT WAS REACHED. PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED. BY STANDING UP WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS HERE IN L. A. COUNTY AND THAT INCLUDES THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS FOR TODAY AND THANK YOU AGAIN. I REQUEST YOUR EITHER.

EIGHTY NINE ONE SEVEN WOULD IMPROVE TRANSIT SYSTEM ACCESSIBILITY SAFETY AND RELIABILITY WELL ADVANCING EQUITY FOR TRANSIT RIDERS CURRENT LAW ALLOWS EASY TRANSIT DISCOURAGE ILLEGAL PARKING IN THE TRANSIT ONLY LANES OF OUR NEW BUS RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM TEMPLE THE CAMERAS MOUNTED ON TEMPLE COACHES HAVE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN DISCOURAGING ILLEGAL PARKING IN THE SYSTEM TRANSIT ONLY LANES AS A RESULT THANK YOU FOR DRIVERS AND RIDERS HAVE IMPROVED ALONG THE ROUTE AND OUR SERVICE IS ATTAINING A REMARKABLE ON ON TIME PERFORMANCE OF 82% AS OF LAST WEEK. THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF OUR REGULAR SERVICES FREQUENTLY COMPROMISED WHEN VEHICLES PARKED IN MY SPOT WHENEVER THE PRINTER IS NOT ABLE TO REACH THE CURB WRITERS ARE FORCED TO LOAD AND UNLOAD IN THE STREET OR NEGOTIATE THE LARGE GAP THAT IS CREATED BETWEEN THE BUT IN THE CURRENT THIS IS A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS MANEUVER FOR WRITERS TO MAKE AN IMPOSSIBLE ONE FOR SENIORS AND THOSE WITH A DISABILITY OR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. VEHICLES BLOCKING BUT THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SENIORS SIX DIFFICULT FOR SENIORS TO GET FROM BUS FOR BICYCLISTS HELLO THERE BIKE.

GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO TREAT THANK MADAM CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE STUFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB ONE ONE SEVEN. TO PROVIDE A REBATE PROGRAM FOR THE PURCHASE OF ELECTRIC BICYCLES OR E. BIKES. EVOKES ARE CLEAN AND HEALTHY FORMER TRANSPORTATION THANK CREE THINKING ABOUT ADOPTION WE'RE REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. A RECENT STUDY OF NORTH AMERICAN E. BIKE OWNERS SHOW THAT NEARLY HALF OR FORTY SIX PERCENT. OF THE BY COMMUTING TRIPS REPLACE AUTOMOBILE COMMUTE TRIPS. TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS WE MUST WORK TO REDUCE. THESE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND REPLACE THEM WITH CLEANER ALTERNATIVES. IF I COULD OFFER HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST YEARS BUT COST REMAINING FACTORS IN AVAILABILITY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS AB ONE ONE SEVEN WILL MAKE E. BIKES MORE AFFORDABLE TO CALIFORNIANS. ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO ADOPT THIS GREENER HEALTHIER FORMER TRANSPORTATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOE. TODAY I HAVE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL CORINNA CONTRERAS COUNCIL MEMBER OF THE CITY OF THE STUFF AND DAVE SNYDER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION. THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO FIRST TO OUR WITNESS ON THE PHONE KATRINA CONTRASTS OPERATOR. BRAINERS YOU ARE DIALED IN PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO SO I CAN OPEN YOUR LINE. DAVE SURE LET'S GO TO DAVE SNYDER- IN THE WITNESS FROM PLEASE. A GOOD AFTERNOON SHARE GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY MY NAME'S DAVE SNYDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BICYCLE COALITION OUR ORGANIZATION WORKS FOR BETTER COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY MORE EQUITABLE COMMUNITIES. WHERE RESIDENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE ECONOMY AND THE HEALTH AND THE JOY OF BICYCLING FOR MORE ABOUT COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE ABOUT THE MACHINE ITSELF. WHICH IS WHY WE LOVE THIS BILL. HI GETTING AROUND BY ANY KIND OF BIKE IS FUN BUT E. BIKES ARE SPECIAL AND THEIR UTILITY FOR TRANSPORTATION. THEY MAKE PREVIOUSLY IMPRACTICAL TRICKS SUDDENLY PRACTICAL- THAT STUDY OF NORTH AMERICAN E. BIKE USERS THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CITED ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE TOP FOUR REASONS PEOPLE CITED FOR NOT BIKING FOR TRANSPORTATION. ARE THERE TOO MANY HILLS THE DISTANCES TO FAR THEY DIDN'T WANT TO ARRIVE SWEATY BIKING WAS TOO SLOW. E. BIKES TAKE AWAY ALL THOSE REASONS THAT FLATTENED HILLS REMOVE HEADWINDS THEY MAKE IT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET SWEATY TO GO FAST. YEAH PEOPLE TO RIDE BIKES IS CRITICAL BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT'S NOT POSSIBLE TO QUICKLY ENOUGH ELECTRIFY OUR CAR FLEET WE HAVE TO GIVE PEOPLE. GOOD ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR AND THE BIKE IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE. THAT SAME STUDY FOUND THAT OF THE E. BIKE USERS WHO HAD NOT RIDDEN A BIKE AS AN ADULT. 94% OF THEM BECAME DAILY OR WEEKLY RIGHT SO IT REALLY IS THE THING THAT GETS SOMEONE TO RIDE A BIKE AND HAD RIDDEN A BIKE BEFORE IT'S A GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO A CAR THIS PROGRAM GETS IMPLEMENTED. WE CAN SUPPORT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS WITH A FANTASTIC HEALTHY MOBILITY OPTION WITH ZERO EMISSIONS. AND A VERY LOW COST- WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I VOTE AND I AM HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU FOR FINISHING UNDER TIME AS WELL. OPERATOR DO WE HAVE OUR SECOND WITNESS ON THE PHONE. Q. CURRENT AIRLINE AND OPEN. THANK YOU SO MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING INVITED HERE TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT THEY SEE ON A DAILY BASIS IN MY OWN COMMUNITY MY NAME'S CORRINA CONSIDERED OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL MEMBER REPRESENTING DISTRICT ONE IN THE CITY OF THIS STUFF. IT IS A DISTRICT THAT HAS TWO MAIN TRANSIT CORRIDORS IN A DISTRICT WHERE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS. RESIDING USE EITHER THEIR FEET TO WALK ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER- THEY USED BICYCLES. AND ONE THING THAT I'VE NOTICED IS THAT I'VE SEEN AN UPTICK IN INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE BIKING TO AND FROM WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. I'VE SEEN MORE E. BIKES ON THE ROAD BUT WHAT I DEFINITELY SEE IS A BIG DIVIDE BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD AN INVITE AND THOSE WHO CAN'T. SO WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH A YES VOTE ON AB ONE SEVENTEEN. IS THAT WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS EMBRACING MORE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION. WHILE WEARING R. V. AND T. AND PROVIDING A MORE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION OPTION. NOW YOU KNOW HE BY. REAL AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR MANY FOLKS EVERY DAY TRANSPORTATION MEANS ESPECIALLY FOR FIRST AND LAST MILE PROBLEMS. THE CURRENT COSTS TO BE BY MAKES THEM INACCESSIBLE TO MOST IN OUR COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THAT WOULD NEED TO PURCHASE SEVERAL QUITE. I REALLY WANT TO DATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER BOERNER HORVATH FOR TAKING UP THIS BILL AND WORKING TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS TO TAKE PART IN A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR OUR STATE. NOW FAIR ENOUGH YOU CAN FINISH YOUR TIME RESULT. SURE IF WE DON'T MOVE FORWARD I AM REALLY CONCERNED. THAT PEOPLE MIGHT COMMUNITY ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ACCESS TO EAT BY THAT THE NEED AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DON'T SEE I HAVE NO WITNESSES- IS SCHEDULED IN OPPOSITION I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THE ROOM TO TESTIFY DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES.

SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND CLIMATE PROTECTION ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WAS A FIRST OF ITS KIND LAW TO RECOGNIZE THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INTEGRATED TRANSPORTATION LAND USE AND HOUSING DECISIONS TO MEET STATE CLIMATE GOALS.

HOWEVER REPORTS FROM THE AIR RESOURCE BOARD OF THE L. A. O. AND OTHERS HAVE STATED THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT ON TRACK TO REALIZE THE GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT EXPECTS. UNDER SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE OR THE IMPORTANT CO BENEFITS. THIS BILL REQUIRES EACH MPO TO CREATE A TARGET ACTION PLAN TO DEVELOP AND DEVELOP A NEW BLOCK GRANT PROGRAMS.

AT ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN WOULD SUPPORT GETTING CALIFORNIA BACK ON TRACK BY BRINGING LOCAL REGIONAL AND STATE AGENCIES TOGETHER TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING A REGIONAL CLIMATE GOALS.

HELLO MISTER HAGENS- THANK YOU THIS IS BILL HIGGINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS WHICH IS THE STATE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS ALL EIGHTEEN METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE BILL WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION BUT WE HAVE SOME HELPFUL COMMENTS AND WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS NOT ONLY FOR PROPOSING THE FIRST. QUARTER OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO TO REGIONAL AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM SPECIFIC HOURS SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SPECIFICALLY IN THAT TEN YEARS BUT IT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE BUT ALSO FOR RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN WHAT OUR ROLE OR THE REGIONAL ROLE IS AND REDUCING. GHGS CERVANTES AND ALSO THE ADDITIONAL STATE ACTIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS A PLAN RIGHT NOW AND SHE IDENTIFIED IT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT STATE REGIONAL AND LOCAL PARTNERS NEED TO SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT WE APPRECIATE HER LEADERSHIP ON THAT AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING.

THANK YOU OPERATOR I BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY MEMBERS THAT WANT TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. I'LL JUST I'LL JUST ABOVE I JUST ONE QUESTION I WAS ONE OF YOU COULD SPEAK- ABOUT IMPAIR ON JUST LOCAL CONTROL AND HOW THIS INTERACTS. THE REGIONAL FRAMEWORK AND WHAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE PAST ABOUT CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVING. CONTROL OVER THEIR THEIR OWN MANDATORY. YES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- SO THE BILL REALLY- ASKS THE LOCAL PLANNING ENTITIES TO PLAN WITH THE GOAL IN MIND OF REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND HELPING TO PROVIDE RESIDENTS WITH MORE OPTIONS. TO WALK AND BIKE AROUND THEIR COMMUNITIES- SAFELY IT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR METHOD OF DOING THAT SO IT'S REALLY OPEN TO WHATEVER FITS IN WITH THE LOCAL WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S GOING TO LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO THAT WOULD LOOK IN THE SUBURB AND IT WOULD LOOK IN A RURAL AREA. SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH AND IT LEAVES OPEN TO THE COMMUNITY TO FIND OUT WHAT WHAT WORKS BEST FOR THEM AND I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT HAVING THAT LOCAL ABILITY TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE AND EXPERIMENT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AT THIS POINT. AND AS MR HIGGINS SAID WE ARE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE **** AND THE PLANNING ENTITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORKABLE FOR THEM. I WE ARE ALSO IS HE SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME ATTEMPTING TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THEM AS THEY DO THIS THESE PLANNING EXERCISES.

WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF ELECTRONIC REGISTRATION CARDS DIGITAL LICENSE PLATES AND LICENSE PLATE WRAPS. TODAY THE DMB SPENDS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION IN POSTAGE FOR THE MAILING OF REGISTRATION RENEWAL NOTICES AND NEW REGISTRATION CARDS AND TAX THIS PROGRAM CAN ALLOW THE DMV TO ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS BY ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR MAILING TAGS AND ALLOWING USERS. ANOTHER WAY TO RENEW VEHICLE REGISTRATION WITHOUT VISITING A DMV FIELD OFFICE. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN SB EIGHT OH SIX AUTHORIZED THE DMV TO CREATE A PILOT PROGRAM FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION ALTERNATIVES AND REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT PROGRAM. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN THE DMV ISSUED THE REPORT RECOMMENDING MOVING FORWARD WITH THE THREE DEVICES EVALUATED DURING THE PILOT.

THANK YOU I'M NOW GOING TO BRNG IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MISTER GIBSON. WELL I'M SORRY MR FONG. ADJUSTED A- FEW QUICK QUESTIONS I- A TO THE AUTHOR- I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE TECHNOLOGY- I KNOW WE SPOKE- SPOKE BRIEFLY TODAY ABOUT. THE AMBIGUITY ON REGARDING THAT THE FEES OF THE AUTHORITY- IN THE BILL IMMIGRATED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW PROGRAM. AND IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T SPECIFY IN THE BILL- THE DMV WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE SO JUST THE THREE QUESTIONS AND FEEL FREE TO ANSWER. THEM AND ONE OF A TIME WE'RE ALL TOGETHER- IS THAT IS IT YOUR INTENT AT THE DMV OF THE AUTHORIZED IMPOSED. FEES ON ANY REGISTERED LICENSE HOLDER OR JUST THOSE YOU PURCHASE A DIGITAL LICENSE PLATE. AND THEN SECONDLY- IN AND OF COURSE THE REASON I ASK THAT IS THE DMV HAS A HISTORY OF THE PASSIVE. OF OVER CHARGING FEES HIGHER THAN WHAT IS REQUIRED OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE AND SO- I'M I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS YOUR INTENT NOT TO PLACE A CAP ON THE NEW FEES OR TO. SYSTEM OUTPUT A CAP AND AT SOME POINT- SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D BE WILLING TO DISCUSS ADDING LANGUAGE THAT PROTECTS CONSUMERS. WHO ARE NOT PURCHASING THE DIGITAL LICENSE PLATE- FROM THE ADDITIONAL FEES AND JUST HAVING THE THOSE WHO PURCHASED AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT IS A LICENSE PLATE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT WOULD PAY- BOARD FOR. THE SERVICE. SURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT. THE DMV INTENDS TO CHARGE THE VENDOR THAT ENTERS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT- WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT INTENDS TO CHARGE. CONSUMERS VEHICLE OWNERS ADDITIONAL FEES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE. AND THE DEPARTMENT TO CLARIFY. THAT THIS THIS INTACT. BUT AS- THAT I THINK THE ONLY A QUESTION IS THINK. IS I'M SUPPORT OF THE DATA. OF SUPPORTING THE- I JUST WANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM PAYING FEES THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING THE SERVICE IF THEY ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU SURE THANK YOU. MISTER GIBSON. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND TO THE- AUTHOR OF THE BILL I'VE I DID THIS BILL LAST YEAR- AGAIN THIS IS. PROMOTING TECHNOLOGY- THIS IS A PILOT PROGRAM WE MOVED TO- EXTEND THE SUNSET OF THE BLM HAPPENS THE- THAT THE MEMBERS MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD THIS YEAR- I THINK THAT- THE TECHNOLOGY ISN'T AS OUT OF PLACE RIGHT NOW WITH THIS BILL WOULD MASSIVELY MAKES SENSE.
