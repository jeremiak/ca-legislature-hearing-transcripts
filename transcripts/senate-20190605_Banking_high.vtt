NOT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN.

00:17:21.073 --> 00:17:22.474
THE FAULTS OF THESE ESCROW

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.743

PERIODICALLY I MEAN I'M

STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.230
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY.

00:17:45.297 --> 00:17:46.698
EXACTLY HOW THIS WORKS AND

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:48.467
PLEASE HELP ME FIGURE OUT WHAT

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:49.368
MY QUESTION IS.

00:17:49.435 --> 00:17:51.370
IT'S AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.071
THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL

00:17:53.138 --> 00:17:53.972
STANDARD THAT REALLY.

00:17:54.039 --> 00:17:55.707
THAT THEY WEREN'T TARGETING

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:57.543
INDEPENDENCE FOR COMPANIES.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:17:59.344
WHAT IT DOES IS CHANGES THE THE

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:01.880
CALCULATION OF WHAT GETS COUNTED

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:02.815
AS THE?

00:18:02.881 --> 00:18:04.483
AS A LIABILITY WHEN YOU

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.618
CALCULATE THE LIQUID ASSETS.

00:18:06.685 --> 00:18:08.620
SO USUALLY THE ASSET HAS THE

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.255
LEAST HAS VALUE.

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:11.356
I'M BEING AN ACCOUNTANT NOW BUT

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.925
AT LEAST HAS VALUE SO WHAT WHEN

00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:14.226
YOU DO THE THE OTHER

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:17.763
CALCULATIONS OF YOUR NET WORTH.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.198
YOU GET BOTH YOU GET THE ASSET

00:18:19.264 --> 00:18:21.600
AND THE THE LIABILITY AND AND

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:22.901
BUT IN THIS NEW STANDARD MEANS

00:18:22.968 --> 00:18:25.370
WE COULD ONLY GET THE LIABILITY.

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.105
NOT THE ASSET SO INCREASES IN

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:28.507
THE END THIS IS.

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:29.575
YOU CAN'T COUNT IT IS AN ASSET

00:18:29.641 --> 00:18:30.843
WHICH WE CAN'T COUNT IT AS A

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.712
ASSET WE HAVE IT'S NOT TO DO

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.081
WITH -- WITH DEFAULT

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.083
CERTIFICATIONS BECAUSE THOSE ARE

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.419
COVERED BY BONDS THIS IS -- A

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:42.054
LIQUID ASSET REQUIREMENT WE HAVE

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.223
ON THE BOOKS.

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.458
OR IN THE CAN SWELL MICHAEL CAN

00:18:46.525 --> 00:18:47.826
PROBABLY SPEAK TO THAT MORE THAN

00:18:47.893 --> 00:18:50.262
I CAN BECAUSE HE'S BEEN AROUND

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:52.531
LONGER EVEN THAN ME.

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:53.832
BUT IT REALLY DOESN'T ADD ANY

00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:55.601
VALUE I DON'T SEE ANY CONSUMER

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:57.469
PROTECTION TO IT HAVING MORE

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:58.971
MONEY BUT I CAN'T USE.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:02.741
DOESN'T PROTECT ANYBODY.

00:19:02.808 --> 00:19:03.275
SENATE CAREER JUST AS THE

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:05.444
EXAMPLE.

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:07.212
LET'S SAY THE COMPANY HAS AN

00:19:07.279 --> 00:19:09.481

00:19:11.917 --> 00:19:15.521
LIABILITIES. THREE TWELVE THIRTY

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:16.021

IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF THE NEW.

00:19:17.689 --> 00:19:18.724
ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ROLE.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:20.225
OF TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.426

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:22.828
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE COMMISSIONS A

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:24.396
ON PLOYS AND SO ON OTHER NET

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:25.230
LIQUID.

00:19:25.297 --> 00:19:26.532
IS A FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR

00:19:26.598 --> 00:19:28.800
DIFFERENCE AND HAVE TO BE A

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:29.401
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND LET'S SAY

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.637

NOW COMES INTO A CURRENT

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:42.915
LIABILITY POSITION ON THE BALLOT

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:43.148

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.532
THERE ARE DIFFERENT.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:02.100

OBLIGATIONS ON THE BALANCE SHEET.

00:21:32.924 --> 00:21:34.159
IN UNITED STATES GAP.

THEY JUST WERE NOT ON THE

00:21:43.702 --> 00:21:44.636
BALANCE SHEET.

00:21:44.703 --> 00:21:47.339
AND SO FAST WE DECIDED TO TAKE

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:49.007
THIS THIS POSITION AND THEN.

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:50.142
A COUPLE YEARS AFTER THAT STAR

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:51.710
THE ABANDONED THE NEED FOR

00:21:51.777 --> 00:21:53.045
INTERNATIONAL CONVERGENCE BUT

00:21:53.111 --> 00:21:54.312
THEY'RE STILL LIKE THE IDEA.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:55.347
RELATIVE TO THE LENDING

00:21:55.414 --> 00:21:56.948

THE LENDING COMMUNITY ALL

00:21:59.184 --> 00:22:01.219
OBLIGATIONS THAT A COMPANY WOULD

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:02.587
HAVE ON ITS BALANCE SHEET.

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.056
AND SO THEY SIDE THEY'RE STILL

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:05.057
WANTED TO HAVE.

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:06.591
LEASE OBLIGATIONS BOOKED ON TO

00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:07.893

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:09.261
FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURE.

00:22:09.327 --> 00:22:10.395

AND AND THE DATE OF THE BALANCE

00:22:17.235 --> 00:22:18.103
SHEET WOULD CHOSE OF HIS CURRENT.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.738
LAW THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IMPACTING

00:22:19.805 --> 00:22:21.039
LENDER COVENANTS ON LOAN

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:22.908
COVENANTS ON PEOPLE'S LINES OF

00:22:22.974 --> 00:22:24.376
CREDIT AND SO ON AND SO THAT'S

00:22:24.443 --> 00:22:26.978
WHY THEY ALSO TOOK ALMOST LIKE A

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:28.413
SIX YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.414
SO THAT PUBLICLY TRADED

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:30.315
COMPANIES ARE EFFECTIVE AT THE

00:22:30.382 --> 00:22:31.817

YOUR STILL GONNA BE ABOVE TWENTY

DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDER

00:23:55.734 --> 00:23:57.702
CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS.

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:59.871
AND THE CALIFORNIA PROTECTIONS

00:23:59.938 --> 00:24:02.808
ARE UNLIKE OTHER.

00:24:02.874 --> 00:24:04.276
EVERY OTHER STATE WE HAVE

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:06.611
PERFORMED A A DO AND AND

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.647
CONDUCTED DUE DILIGENCE LOOKING

AT ALL THE OTHER STATES THAT WE

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.350
COULD DISCOVER.

00:24:12.417 --> 00:24:14.152
IN A SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:24:14.219 --> 00:24:16.755
FINDING THAT THEY ALL STATES ARE

00:24:16.822 --> 00:24:21.993
NOT AS GOOD AS CALIFORNIA. TO IT

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:22.727
DOESN'T AFFECT AUDIT

CALIFORNIA OR MANDATORY.

00:24:32.204 --> 00:24:34.506
UNLIKE OTHER STATES.

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.976
THE AUDIT SORE ANNUAL AND THE

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:40.979
LAST POINT IS THAT THIS ISN'T AN

00:24:41.046 --> 00:24:46.218

ANYPURPOSE.

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:08.173
SERVING AS AN IMPEDIMENT.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.442
AS WE WERE SAYING TO THE

00:25:21.219 --> 00:25:23.622
THE SHORT ANSWER IN LAYMAN'S

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:25.323

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.992
AND I CAN MAKE IT EVEN SHORTER

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:28.260
THAN THAT.

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.462
