NINE ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION- WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISS CARILLO A SECOND BY DOCTOR QUIRK. YOU MAY PROCEED I DON'T CARE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME I KNOW IT'S A BUSY DAY FOR EACH OF YOU IN MISTER VICE CHAIR THANK YOU AGAIN AT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS A DO PASS ECOMMENDATION I'LL STREAMLINED THE PRESENTATION HERE. BOTTOM LINE IS YOU ALL KNOW- FOR MANY OF YOU THIS IS GONNA LOOK SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT THE PRO TIM AUTHORED LAST SESSION WHICH WAS O. S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY- AND WE TOOK A GOOD DEAL THAT MET THE FATE OF A HARD DEADLINE. AND AFTER LISTENING TO FEEDBACK THAT IT IS BEING IMPROVED IN THAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAIN GOALS AT FOR THE PROTEIN IS TO IMPROVE THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO. JUST FOCUS QUICKLY ON TO RECENT CHANGES THAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY OUR UNDERSTANDING THIS IS A FISCAL COMMITTEE BECAUSE THE PROTEIN LISTEN TO ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IN POLICY COMMITTEE TO BE TO MAKE THESE CHANGES NUMBER ONE RECENT AMENDMENT STRENGTHENED THE OWNER OCCUPANCY PROVISION CURRENTLY IN THE BILL BY MAKING IT A STATEWIDE REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE THAT HOMEOWNERS. BENEFIT FROM THESE NEW HOUSING OPTIONS NOT CORPORATE INVESTORS. NUMBER TWO. SECOND SB NINE NOW ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DENY A PROPOSED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR A LOT SLIT. IF THE BUILDING OFFICIAL IN THE CITY OR COUNTY MAKES A FINDING THAT THERE IS AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY THAT CAN'T BE MITIGATED. QUICK EXAMPLE OF HOW THAT WOULD WORK. SO WE TOOK WHAT WAS ALREADY A PROCESS IN LAW. A STANDARD APPROVED THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT. AN INDEBTED IT IN SB NINE. SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF A BUILDING OFFICIAL. IN A CITY OR COUNTY. FINDS THAT A HOMEOWNER CAN'T MITIGATE FOR FIRE RISK. THEN THAT DEVELOPMENT. CAN BE STOPPED IN TONIGHT. SAME THING IF THERE ARE TOXIC SUBSTANCES ON THE SITE SAME THING IF THE HOMEOWNERS TRYING TO DEVELOP FOR EXAMPLE ON IT TOO STEEP A SLOPE. I WANT TO POINT OUT ON THE FISCAL SIDE THAT. THE PRO TEAM IN THE SPEAKER HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IN VERY GRATEFUL IN REGARD TO THE INVESTMENTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR HAD MADE THIS YEAR IN REGARDS TO COMBATING HOUSING CRISIS AND THAT'S GONNA INCLUDE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE MILLION. TO HELP LOW INCOME FIRST TIME HOMEBUYERS ANY EIGHTY YOU FINANCING FOR THE FIRST TIME TO BE A TO GET EIGHTEEN IS DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THIS BILL CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE REAL PROGRESSIVE AND POSITIVE CHANGE IN STRENGTH IN THE FABRIC OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS WITH EQUITY INCLUSIVITY. IS WELLS AFFORDABILITY AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND CHAIR I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON BEHALF OF. AMERICANS WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE PHONE LINES I DO WANT SINCE WE HAVE THREE WITNESSES BEGAN THE STRONG SUPPORT WHEN IN OPPOSITION. I DO WANNA REMIND WITNESSES AT THIS POINT THAT THIS IS A FISCAL COMMITTEE SO THE ONLY THING YOU ARE TO SPEAK TOWARDS IS THE FISCAL I AM NOT GOING TO SO IF YOU START VERY OFTEN A POLICY. WHERE WE'RE GOING TO STOP YOU YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND WE WILL START WITH- LAUREN. THE DIFFERENCE YEAH EAST ON SHOWS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AREN'T ABLE ONE PAIR REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CHAPTER AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB NINE. THE ABILITY TO RENT OR OWN A HOME CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING CHALLENGE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA FURTHER EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. UNDER CURRENT LAW MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AREAS CAN ONLY BE USED FOR SINGLE DWELLING AND THAT'S PLYMOUTH HOUSING SUPPLY INCLUDES LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT MINORITY COMMUNITIES. WITH HOME PRICES STEADILY RISING DUE TO LIMITED SUPPLY STEMMING FROM INCREASED COST OF BUILDING MATERIAL LABOR SHORTAGES AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS. CALIFORNIA MATTHEW MORE EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES. SB NINE CREATED BY RIGHT MINISTERIAL PROCESS FOR THE CREATION OF TWO HOMES AND A SINGLE FAMILY LOTS IT ALSO ABOUT PERSONAL MAPS TO CREATE TWO LOTS FROM ONE. TO LIVE WITH YOU UNITS EACH EIGHTY LAW ALREADY ALLOWS UP TO THREE UNITS A LOT OF THIS IS AN AND INCREMENTAL. CHANGE THAT THE KEY. APART FROM THAT. WERE ALLOWS HOMES BE FOR. THIS WILL HELP HOME ON OP. NOT AVAILABLE UNDER OTHER HOUSING PRODUCTION BUILD. DEVELOPMENT UNDER SB NINE WOULD BE PRIVATELY FUNDED AND WOULD NOT REQUIRE DIRECT EIGHT. EIGHT FUNDING INCREASES TO INCREASE HOUSING COMPLY ALLOWING MORE UNITS FOR EXISTING LAW WILL ALSO MAKE IT EASIER FOR JURISDICTIONS TO COMPLY WITH NEW ARENA MANDATE. AND IT ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE PRESUMPTION FORGET OPTION OF NEW ORDINANCES WHICH WILL HELP REDUCE COSTS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS JOKES ACTUALLY THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. FINALLY SB NINE WILL COULD INCREASE HOUSING OPTIONS AND SINGLE FAMILY FOUND TO MAKE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MORE INCLUSIVE ALL THIS WITHOUT MAJOR FINANCIAL IMPACT THE GENERAL FUND. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SENATE. FOR GREATER HELP ON THE THING THAT WAS TWO MINUTES AGO THANK YOU.
