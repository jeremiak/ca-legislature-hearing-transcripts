GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS START OFF WITH A LITTLE SLIDE SHOW ON THE ORGAN BOTTLE- BILL I WAS I DIDN'T AND JUST FOR SENATE DIE WE'VE BECAUSE IS THE ONLY MEASURE ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S THIS AND CONCEPTUAL ISSUES INVOLVED HERE WE'VE HAD. EXTENDED THE CENTER OF COURTESY OF A LITTLE MORE TIME THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE ALLOWED IN THE PRESENTATION OF A BILL OF THE SNOW AND ON OUR DOCKET TODAY AND MISTER CHAIR YOU MAY BE AWARE THE CENTER DOLLY LIVES TO STONE'S THROW AWAY FROM THE OREGON BORDER SO HE'S FAMILIAR WITH RIDE HAILING FROM THROWING STONE GROWS GROCERIES. AND THEN IN THIS BAILEY PUT TOGETHER THIS THIS LIGHT SHOW HE'S A FORMER MEMBER OF THE AT THE ORGAN LEGISLATURE WHO IS NOW BEEN HIRED BY THIS PRIVATE CONSORTIUM OR COOPERATIVES THEY CALL IT IN IN OREGON TO RUN THEIR STUPID **** STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM SO- FIRST LIGHT. OR WE HAVE A LITTLE VIDEO HERE THAT THEY PUT TOGETHER I THINK IT'S A THIRTY A. SIXTY SECOND DD IF WE COULD HIT THE NEXT SLIDE. I ACTION LOCAL BOTTLE DRIVES. A BUSTLING WITH PEOPLE ON EARTH DAY BUT THE HOLIDAY ISN'T NECESSARILY THE REASON WHY. IT INCREASE IN RATES ANSON ADDED CONVENIENCE AND PEOPLE SIGNING UP FOR THE PROGRAM INTRO. HE'S EVER DONE GETTING MONEY BACK FOR HER BOTTLES FOR THE FIRST TIME LET'S LIKE GET THAT STUFF OUT OF THE WAY AND YOU KNOW GET SOME CASH WITH AS WELL SHE'S ONE OF THE TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO ARE OPENING UP AN ACCOUNT WITH THE PROGRAM EVERY DAY. FOR SOMEONE AS BUSY AS I AM IT'S GREAT TO HAVE THE BACKS BAGS YOU KNOW JUST CONFIRMING YOUR CAR TAX THEM UP AND DROPPING OFF AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT YOU'LL END UP WITH SOME CASH BY THE END OF THE DAY. FEEL STRAINING IS WITH OREGON BEVERAGE WE CLING COOPERATIVE WHICH OPERATES THE PROGRAM WE'RE VERY BUSY- WHICH IS EXCITING I'LL DROP IS SEEN A MAJOR BOOST IN RETURNS FROM 65% BEFORE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO NOW ABOUT 85% EACH MONTH. THE REASON IN EIGHT TWENTY SEVENTEEN RATES WENT FROM FIVE TO TEN CENTS FOR EACH BOTTLE MORE CONTAINERS ARE COMING BACK FOR PEOPLE RETURNING- IN THEIR. DEPOSITS AND ALL THOSE CONTAINERS ARE GETTING RECYCLED. HERE'S HOW IT WORKS A STORAGE CHARGES A TEN CENT DEPOSIT ON THESE BOTTLES AND CANS. AND THEN YOU AS A CONSUMER CAN BRING THEM BACK FOR CASH. THE GREEN BAG DROP OFF AND AN APP HAS ADDED TO THE CONVENIENCE. OF THIS DRAMA. AND USE THAT TO. JUST REGISTER FOR AN ACCOUNT AT YOUR NEAREST BOTTLE DROP CENTER AND PICK UP YOUR CARD IN BAGS. ACTIVATED ONLINE AND START FILLING THOSE BAGS THEN DROP IT OFF AND CASH OUT THERE'S A LOT HAPPENING IN RECYCLING IN THE WORLD RIGHT NOW. AND THE RETURN RATES- IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW ORGAN CONTINUES TO BE A LEADER AND- ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSERVATION ISSUES. NOW SOME USE THAT CASH BACK FOR THEIR SAVINGS MAYBE FOR A LITTLE EXTRA SPENDING MONEY BUT YOU CAN ALSO USE IT TO GIVE BACK TO LOCAL CHARITIES USING THAT AB. PRETTY FOLDERS KGW NEWS. AND THAT'S THE STORY FROM OREGON SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS A BRIEF HISTORY OF WHAT'S OF WHAT'S HAPPENED I KNOW WE LIKE WE THINK THE CALIFORNIA'S THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE AND WE'VE GOT THE BEST. RECYCLING PROGRAM THAT STARTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX BUT FIFTEEN YEARS. BEFORE ON EARTH THEY ARE FOLLOWING EARTH DAY ORGANS. SIGNED THE- THEIR BOTTLE BILL AND THEY BASICALLY BEING BEEN RUNNING THEIR PROGRAM FOR TWELVE YEARS THIS IS THEIR THERE THEY'RE COMING AT LEAST THE CREATION OF IT. AND WHAT I'D LIKE YOU TO. LOOK AT IS THE TWENTY SIXTEEN TWENTY SEVENTEEN BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOW A PROGRAM WHERE THEY HAVE REUSABLE BOTTLES WE'LL GET ANOTHER SLIDE LATER AND THAT THAT INCREASE IN THE DEPOSIT. TO TEN CENTS HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER BECAUSE THAT'S NOT JUST. TRASH AND AN INCIDENTAL THING TEN CENSUS REAL MONEY AND THAT COMBINATION IN THE LAST. THREE YEARS OF THE REUSABLE BOTTLES THIS IS. THINK OF YOUR CRAFT BREWERIES AND WINE PEOPLE ARE IN THIS- THIS EXPANSION INTO TEN SENSIBLE REALLY HAS HAS ALLOWED THESE DISTRIBUTORS WHO RUN THE WHOLE SHOW UP IN OREGON. TO REALLY RUN A FIRST RATE PROGRAM THAT pIS THIS IS THE SOME STATISTICS AND REFRESH YOUR MEMORY ORGAN HAS ABOUT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAS FORTY MILLION PEOPLE NOT THAT EACH OF THESE NUMBERS SHOULD HAVE. A ZERO ONE EFFORT BUT FOR PURPOSES OF INTRODUCTION YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT. FIVE THOUSAND ORGAN EMPLOYEES PROBABLY AROUND FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEES ABOUT YOU KNOW FIVE PROCESSING PLANTS DEPENDING ON DIE DYNAMICS ABOUT FIFTY WERE WERE THEY GET WERE YOU SEE THIS WERE ALL. THE CANS AND- BOTTLES AND THE- PLASTICS COME IN AND THEY GET SUPER SQUISH ONCE THEY'VE BEEN THE BARCODES BEEN READ PEOPLE GOT THEIR MONEY AND- AND THE LIKE. AND AGAIN THEY'RE PROCESSING YOU KNOW A TWO BILLION CONTAINERS A YEAR I WOULD PROBABLY YOU KNOW NORTH OF TWENTY BILLION EASILY EASILY HERE IN CALIFORNIA I'M WHAT THE WHAT THE POTENTIAL TO AND- THE LAST FLIGHT FOR. FROM NOT ONLY THE- LIBERALS AND THE CONSERVATIVES ON THE COMMITTEE BUT ZERO TAX DOLLARS SPENT THAT'S THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF THIS THING IS THAT WE'RE FIGHT WE'RE GOING TO SAY. HERE'S A PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN YOU KNOW GOT BANDAIDS ON PALM BANDES PEN BANDAIDS WE KNOW WHAT'S NOT WORKING I'LL GET TO THAT MY PRESENTATION BUT HERE IS HERE IS LET PRIVATE INDUSTRY RUN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON WILL GIVE THEM THE LEAD TIME. AND THEY CAN LEARN FROM WHAT TH THEN THE PREVIOUS CHART ON WHAT WHAT OREGON HAS DONE AND WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH BIGGER. AND BETTER BECAUSE WE'RE CALIFORNIA NEXT SLIDE. THE WAY THAT THIS. COOPERATIVE IS DONE THEY'VE ACTUALLY BY THE SITES THEY ACTUALLY BY THE SITES THEY OWN THE LAND THEY MAKE THE INVESTMENT BECAUSE THIS IS PRIVATE PRIVATE COMPANY COMPANIES AND THIS IS THE BOTTLE DROP WHICH IS THE BIG ENCHILADA THIS IS GOT A PERSON WHO'S IN THERE WHO'S LIKE CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT HELPS PEOPLE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY DO THE DROPS THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN THE BACK THAT. SORTING THAT TO GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE. THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT LOOK THIS IS THE REDEMPTION CENTERS HAVE EVERYTHING THAT'S THE MACHINE THAT YOU SAW ON THE VIDEO WHERE PEOPLE COME IN WITH ALL THEIR BAGS AND THEY FEED A MAN. AT THE FEET OF MEANT THEY ALSO HAVE. AN ACCOUNT SOME AND IF YOU GO BEHIND THERE YOU KNOW THEY GOT THAT MECHANISM THAT SEPARATES CLASS SEPARATE. SEPARATE PLASTIC SEPARATES- WITH THE OTHER ONE PLASTIC GLASS. ALUMINUM ALUMINUM AND THEN AND THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEPARATE THEM BY COLORS RIGHT. THE IN THIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A BAIL OF GREEN PLASTIC AND A BALE OF CLEAR PLASTIC. IT'S THE SMELL OF MONEY MAN IT'S AT THAT SEPARATION CREATES THE VALUE BECAUSE YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST. BEST FITS SO THEY CAN YOU KNOW FOR OUR PURPOSES HERE THEY'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE OF THESE FULL SERVICE REDEMPTION CENTERS WHERE YOU CAN GO WHEN THERE'S A PERSON THEY'RE THEY'RE HELPING YOU. AND THEY HAVE THAT THAT KOSKS- ALSO THE LITTLE THAT THEY YES IT WILL BE IN THE NEXT LIKE BUT ONCE AGAIN MISTER CHAIR. MISTER I CENTER DOLLY ZERO COST TAXPAYERS YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS THE FUTURE THIS IS A PRIVATE INDUSTRY. GOVERNMENT SAYING YOU GUYS RUN IT YOU'RE THE BEST THAT NEXT SLIDE. OKAY SO WITH WHAT'S THE GREEN BAG ACCOUNTS AT THIS IS THEY DEVELOP THIS AND YOU CAN USE ALL ON THE- ON THE SECOND SLIDE. YOU TAKE ALL YOUR BOTTLES AND YOU PUT THEM CLICK CANCEL YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER AND YOU SIGN UP FOR THE PROGRAM YOU REGISTER IN THE A. C.

YOU GET A NUMBER YOU GET AN ACCOUNT AND YOU SIMPLY. GET YOUR- BAR CODES INFORMATION YOU BACK IT YOU. TURN IT UP AND YOU DROP IT OFF AT A ADDED CHAOS IN AT ONE OF THESE DROPS AND THEY HAVE THESE DROPS ALL OVER THE BEAUTY OF THIS. THE BEAUTY OF THIS IS THAT THEY CAN GO INTO RURAL AREAS THEY CAN GOING SUB AREAS THEY CAN GO THE URBAN AREAS AND THEY'RE FINDING THE PEOPLE WILL PUT BAGS IN. AND IT'S BACK TO YOU GET ON YOUR COMPUTER YOU DO WHAT. ALSO HALF OF. CALIFORNIA ARE. OUR COOPER IF THEY GET UP CAN LEARN FROM THEM THEY HAVE A BLUE BAG PROGRAM. AND THE BLUE BRAG PROGRAM IS FOR SCHOOLS AND NONPROFITS SO IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IF YOU WANT TO SIGN UP FROM YOUR ACCOUNT. AND HAVE A GO AUTOMATICALLY TO YOUR- NONPROFIT OF THE OF AB OF CHOICE HE'S PUT IN THE BLUE BACK THIS IS IT THE NAME BOTTLE DROP IS THAT IT THAT'S IT THAT'S A STATE. ENTITY THAT THE STATE I KNOW WHAT'S THIS PRIVATE COOPERATIVE IT BUT IT'S THE NAME OF THE BRAND THAT THEY HAVE. BEEN WHO IT. COMPANY OR IS IT- IT'S ACOOPERATIVE IS COOPER IS QUITE THIS PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. NO PRIVATE- IT'S WITH BASS WHAT'S BEEN CREATED BY THAT ISRAEL DOESN'T WATERS OF SAID WE'RE GONNA CALL CALIFORNIA MAY CALL THE BOTTLE FINDER. COLLEGES AND SEE. THE MAYBE THEY THEY ARE THEY ARE. THAT THE- B. R. C. IS A- RIGHT THE ORGAN BEVERAGE RECYCLING COOPERATIVE THERE THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT'S RUNNING AT THAT WITH THE DISTRIBUTOR AND THIS IS AN ENTITY CREATED BY THE OF YOUR SEAT LIKE THIS IS THE- THIS IS THE- PHYSICAL ASSETS THAT THEY HAVE WHAT THEY HOW. HOW THEY THEIR MARKETING THEIR BRAND OKAY SAY K. IT'S THE BOTTLE DROP YOU GO NGUYEN INTO PROJECT AND I WAS WHEN I WAS HERE YOU KNOW THE- I THINK. UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF. MUNICIPALITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO THINK THAT THESE RECYCLING CENTERS ARE YOU KNOW- AWAY WORD FOR FIRST PLACE FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE NOW THAT IT'S ONLY YOU GET YOU HAVE A CONVENIENCE ON OUTSIDE YOUR GROCERY STORE JUST GONNA HAVE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHAT SHOPPING CARTS. HANGING AROUND. THIS WAS LIKE. AFTER CHURCH IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE I WAS THERE ON A WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AT OUR WEDNESDAY MORNING AT TEN. AND ALL KINDS OF NORMAL PEOPLE PULLING UP THEIR CARS GOING IN YOU KNOW CHATTING IT UP AND DROPPING. DROPPING THE STEPS OFF AND IT WAS CONVENIENT YOU KNOW I TALKED TO A COUPLE OF FROM SAID. THE BILL CC I GOTTA GET TO WORK BUT HE GET ON MY WAY. NEXT SLIDE. SO THIS IS THE- THIS I THE- I GUESS. WHAT A NOTHER SIZE. EXPRESS TO GET THE BALL CHOP EXPRESS SO THIS IS NOT THE FULL MONTY WE HAVE. YOU CAN GO IN AND YOU CAN. DROP OFF YOUR BOTTLES ONE BY ONE THIS IS ONLY FOR THE GREEN BACK IN A BLUE BACKDROP. AND YOU SEE THEY HAVE A TIME SO THAT THEY DON'T WANT PEOPLE LOITERING AROUND THERE. BUT YOU CAN YOU'VE GOT YOUR CARD USE. YOU SWIPE IT. YOU OPEN IT UP AND YOU DROP IT AND YOU'RE GONNA SIT THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THE RURAL PEOPLE. AND THE P. IT LOVE THIS BECAUSE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING SERVED WE'RE GOING TO HEAR SOME OF THE PEOPLE. AND WE WILL HELP. HEARING ABOUT ALL THE TIMES THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING SERVED IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND WHAT DO THESE THINGS IS AN EASY DROP IN AT. THIS AND PRIVATE BUSINESS THE SIDES BE SOMEWHAT THE MAP IS. IT LOOKS SIMILAR TO THIS. IN THE- IN THE CITIES IN AN URBAN AREA. IT SAYS IT'S NOT EXACTLY AS THEY PUT IT WITHIN A STORE BUT IT'S AT THIS PLACE WHERE YOU COME IN. THE BACK AND- AND- AND GET OUT OF TOUCH. I'M SO THAT'S EXPRESS NESS. NEXT ONE. OKAY SAID THIS IS THE- THIS IS. WHAT I WOULD GUESS SO I CALL IT THE- THE- FULL MONTY LIKE SO THIS IS GOT THE BOTTLE SHOP YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. THIS IS AN OUTDOOR FACILITY BUT ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE IT'S GOT TO WITH THOSE LITTLEVENDING MACHINES REVERSE VENDING MACHINES. THAT YOU'RE WHEN YOU WALK IN AND IF YOU WANTED TO. YOU WANT TO DO THAT YOU CAN REVERSE SPEND IT AND THERE'S- AND THEN THE OTHER THE GREEN. THE OTHER SIDE HE'S GOT THE- THE BACKDROP SO YOU'VE GOT THAT. YOU YOU CAN GO IN AND YOU CAN DROP IT OFF IN THERE. THIS IS WHAT I THINK OF YOU KNOW. SUBURBIA YOU KNOW WHERE OR- SMALL MARKETS WHERE YOU WANT TO HAVE THE CONVENIENCE EVERYBODY AND IT'S NOT US IT'S NOT CAL RECYCLES NOT TO SIGN THIS. THE LOGISTICS THAT THE SAYING THIS THIS IS COULD BE PROUD INDUSTRY. WHAT MAKES SENSE TO SERVICE THE EERIE BECAUSE- THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE FULL RESPONSE. OF IT. YOU SEE THAT LITTLE KIOSK ON THE RIGHT THAT THAT LITTLE MACHINE THEY GOT. ALL OVER THAT GOT THAT AT FRED MEYER SAFE WAY COSCO. AT THE ALL THE ALL THE- SERVICE CENTERS AND THAT'S WHERE YOU GO IN WITH THE- MUSIC THEY SAID THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE A DAY ARE SIGNING UP FOR THE THING. YOU GO WHEN THEY'RE YOU PUTTING YOUR NAME YOU GET AN ACCOUNT NUMBER IN AND- IT SPITS OUT THE- YOUR TAX AT YOUR- YOUR CODE YOU BARCODE SO THAT. WHEN YOU TAKE A GREEN BAG AND YOU DROP IT OFF. IT'S IN THERE. YOU CAN ALSO GO IN. IN THERE AND- THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT THE UPDATE IS HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE IN YOUR ACCOUNT. THAT THAT YOU COULD USE AND THEN THEY HAVE LIKE A- THE CASH MACHINES IF YOU WANT TO GET CASH TO SOME PEOPLE WANT TO GET CASH. AND SOME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CASH IN AGAIN. YOU KNOW. THEY GOT THEIR COMMITTED TO EIGHTY OF THESE LOCATIONS YOU CAN IMAGINE CALIFORNIA PUT A ZERO ON IT AND THAT'S WHERE. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT IT BUT IT'S EASY IT'S FASTER IT'S CLEAN AND EVERYBODY'S ALL IN. NEXT SLIDE. OKAY SO YOU GET YOUR CASH TO THIS IS. THIS IS THE WAY THAT WE TEACH. YOU KNOW IT IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS WE TEACH KIDS ABOUT THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND THE BENEFITS OF RECYCLING. BUT ALSO THE VALUE OF MONEY. AN WHAT THEY'VE COME UP WITH THE CAN THEIR PROGRAM HAS MATURED. OUR NEW COOPERATIVE WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE ALL THE GOOD THINGS BUT- WHAT. WHAT WE'RE FINALLY FINDING IS AT THE RETAIL STORE SHOULD ON THE ONES THAT DON'T. THEY HAVE TO. PAY A HUNDRED BUCKS IF THEY DON'T HAVE A CONVENIENCE OWN AND THE ONES THAT HAVE THE CLEAN SOUNDS. THEY'RE OFFERING THESE TWENTY PERCENT. REWARDS AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY PUTTING THESE CHAOS I WAS AT A FRED MEYER TO CHAOS. IS RIGHT THERE FRED MEYERS EIGHT IN THE TO DO WHAT THEY HAD ONE OF THOSE. GREEN BACKDROPS. BUT THEY'RE SAYING. IF YOU COME IN WITH YOUR LITTLE. RECEIPT THAT I HAVE EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS. ON MY- ON MY ACCOUNT BECAUSE WE'VE RECYCLED- SO MUCH. THEY'LL GIVE YOU A 20% REWARD. IN PART OF IT IS FROM THE YOU KNOW THE- AMAZON WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING INTO STORES ANYMORE SO THAT. BRICK AND MORTAR FOLKS WANT THEM TO GO TO STORES THEY GOT A GREAT PROGRAM. TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE SO AGAIN IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU TELL YOUR KIDS WHEN THEY RECYCLE. OKAY WE'RE GONNA PUT THIS IN YOUR COLLEGE ACCOUNT IT DEPENDS ON THE FAMILY MAN IT'S JUST. I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN GIVE THAT. YOU CAN. GET MORE MONEY FOR YOURSELF GOING TO THIS. YOU JUST GO IN THERE AND SAY GIVE ME THE CASH. AND THE FINDING MORE MORE PEOPLE LIKE THAT THE LAST THREE NEXT LIFE. OKAY SO THIS IS HOW THE MEASURE SUCCESS AND I DON'T YOU KNOW THESE LITTLE DOTS ON THE BOTTOM ARE ALL THE LITTLE POINTS SEE IF AND IN. THE CITY WHEN YOU GOT THE ON THE TOP SLIDES GOT THE DIFFERENT POINTS WITH A WERE YOU CAN. OR SIGNING UP OBVIOUSLY IN THE URBAN AREAS THERE'S MORE THAN THE- THAN THE- RURAL AREAS BUT THE BIG PICTURE IN OREGON IS THAT YOU SEE COVERED. YEAH DROP OFFICERS ON THE SECOND ONE THEY'RE ALL DROP OFF CENTER SO THEY'VE GOT IT COVERED SO YOU WOULD IMAGINE. IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS UP AND RUNNING THAT'S THE SAME THING IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GOING TO. THEY'RE GOING TO. THEY'RE GOING TO DOTHAT AND- YOU KNOW AGAIN THE NONPROFITS IS YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THE NONPROFITS BUT THEY THEY GOT A BILLION BUCKS AT THAT FOLKS ARE GIVING ON THE- ON THE BLUE BAGS- BUT THE OTHER. THE OTHER. INFORMATION AND WHAT YOU HAVE IS IT SIXTY FOUR THESE REDUCTIONS ARE COMING TO THE BALL DROP SO. IT'S POPULAR IT'S IT THE- THE OREGONIANS ARE. ARE EMBRACING THIS- COOPERATIVE. SUCCESS THAT THEY HAVE IN. AS HE WE CAN SEE ONCE AGAIN ON THE BOTTOM INFORMATION. ZERO TAX DOLLARS SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO MORE NO MORE. CONCERNS ABOUT HOW CAL RECYCLES END OF IT IN ADDITION IT'S NOT GOING TO COST THE TAXPAYERS ANY MONEY TO HAVE THIS SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA NEXT SLIDE. OKAY SO WHERE IS WHICH REAL GO BECAUSE WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW I'VE HAD DIFFERENT BILLS ON CONTENT WE'VE HAVE OTHER BUT THE CHAIR HAS HAS A BILL WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WE'RE HOW DO WE GET CALIFORNIANS MATERIAL TO BE RECYCLED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I SAY LOOK NORTH. LOOK NORTH BECAUSE A 100% OF PLASTIC AND IN OREGON. AND EVEN THE AND THAT INCLUDES A REFILLING THIS NEW HOT BOTTLES AND THE OLD ALUMINIUM IS IN DOMESTIC SO WE'RE NOT THIS THE CHINA SUPPORT THE NATIONAL SORT AND ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DAY IN THE COTTON AND TAKE OUR STUFF IN THE CONTAMINATION OF WE HAVE WE CLEAN UP OUR- OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM AND- IT'S- ALL. IN CALIFORNIA. EXCELLENT. OKAY SO WE NEED TO THINK WHAT THE AGAIN GO BACK. THE RECYCLE PLASTIC IN OREGON NO NO ARE THE ARE REALLY COULD DO WONDERS POINT ONCE WE VOTE ON THREE SEVEN TWO AND IT BECOMES LAW OKAY THAT'S WHAT I MEANT I WAS GETTING A LITTLE EXCITED THERE RESEARCHER OKAY SO WHAT'S A NEW THING THAT THIS THAT THIS. PRIVATE PROPERTY NOT GOVERNMENT. WHETHER IT'S AN OLD IT'S A GOOD IDEA IS RE USABLE. BOTTLES AND WHAT THEY'VE GONE IN INTO THESE CRAFT FOR REASON THEY GIVE ME A BREAK BECAUSE IT'S A LOWER COST FOR THE CRAFT BREWERIES THE DESIGN THIS IS SOME SORT OF WHAT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT THAT BUT THEY DECIDED ALL THE CRAFT BREWERS AGREED THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEER BOTTLE OF OREGON RIGHT. WE CAN DUPLICATE WE CAN COPY IT FOR WHATEVER AND THEY IN THEIR FIRST YEAR WHEN THEY START THIS DAY THEY'VE GOT TO OBTAIN MILLION YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET OUR SIX MILLION BY YEAR THREE OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN LOOK AT CALIFORNIANS SAY THE SAME THING. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT YOUR YOUR CRAFT. YOUR BARS AND YOUR ESPERANZA HAVE THESE RECYCLED ARE. REUSABLE BOTTLES AND THEY HAVE THAT THE CONTAINERS YOU KNOW THAT THE CASE AND THEY SIMPLY PUT THE BOTTLES BACK IN. THIS PROGRAM THIS PRIVATE INDUSTRY. OBESE RC TAKES THEM BACK WASHES SOMETHING GIVE SOME BACK TO. GET SOME BACK TO THE FOLKS ITS WILDLY SUCCESSFUL THEY THE- WINE INDUSTRY HAS COME TO THEM VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE ORGANS GOT YOU KNOW IT'S- THERE. THEY'RE ALL CALLS LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE IT'S BUT STATE RUN YOU GOTTA GO TO STATE. CUT PLACE THAT A WAR TO DO IT SO THEY'RE NOT PART OF THEIR THEIR PROGRAM THEY'VE COME TO THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT HALF BOTTLES YOU KNOW THE HAVE BALLS WITH THEY'RE GOING TO DESIGN THEIR WHOLE THING SAID THAT- SO PEOPLE DRINK LAST. DRINK RESPONSIBLY SO IT'S GONNA BE A HALF BOTTLE THAT THEY WANT TO HAVE PUT INTO THIS PROGRAM TO HAVE IT GO WIN SO THERE AGAIN CLOSING THAT LOOP. AND THE CARBON BENEFIT. IS A FRACTION AS IT SAYS RIGHT THERE OF THE EVEN OF THE RECYCLE GLASS IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS WE IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA CAN MATCH OR AGAIN. ON BREWERIES OF MICRO BREWERIES AND WINERIES AND THIS REASONABLE HERE FROM SOME OF THE- CONCERNED PEOPLE OF THIS BILL THAT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THAT SAID. THAT WE GOT A MARKET HERE NEXT SLIDE. SO WHERE ARE YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING RE. REFER BALLS THIS IS A CUTTING EDGE IN OREGON AND WILL BE CUTING EDGE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOT DOING ANY REFILL POLLS ONCE UPON A TIME. WE REFILL OUR BY. NOW WE TW ZERO. WE DO WE DO ZERO SO LATIN AMERICA THE CANADIANS EUROPE THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WERE AS WE AGAIN IT'S NOT THE WHOLE ANSWER THE CLIMATE CHANGE BUT IT'S ANOTHER ANSWER TO SAY. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE OUT SOME OF THESE SOME OF THESE BEVERAGES AND REUSE THEM I MEAN I'M OLD ENOUGH. TO REMEMBER THAT YOU KNOW WHEN I. WHEN I HAD ANY MONEY I BOUGHT A PEPSI I WOULD BREAK THAT BOTTLE GOT CLEANED AND THEY GOT RE. USE THAT'S GONE. FOR SOME REASON SAID AND THIS IS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE LEAST. SAYING REFILL IT AND PEOPLE FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT. AND THEY DRINK THE BEER. NEXT LIFE. THAT'S IT THAT'S IT SO. MISTER CHAIR DEPENDING ON HOW YOU WANT TO IF YOU WANT HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS I'M PREPARED TO. PRESENT MY OPENING STATEMENT ON THE BILL. IS IT NO THAT WAS JUST. THERE WAS A TEASER. ON OPENING STATEMENT ON BILL I HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESSES THAT ARE HERE- OKAY ONCE YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED OKAY. SO I SHOULD. OKAY MOVE OVER. SOME MEMBERS AND- MISTER CHAIR LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR FROM THE OUTSET. OUR OUR CHAIR OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY HAS WON THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL BILLS- OF THIS SESSION SB FIFTY FOUR AND I'M PROUD TO BE A CO. AUTHOR OF THAT AND HOPEFULLY SB FIFTY FOUR GIVES CALIFORNIA A MANDATE TO MOVE OUR FAILED BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM INTO AN E. P. R. PROGRAM LED BY STUART STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL RUN BY BUSINESSES HOWEVER IS. SB FIFTY FOUR CONTINUES DISCUSSIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS IN THE CAPABLE HANDS OF OUR OF OUR CHAIR I BRING FORWARD THREE SEVENTY TWO AS- A BACKSTOP. I'M SB THREE SEVENTY TWO IS A COMPREHENSIVE BOTTLE REFORM BILL DOESN'T DEAL WITH SINGLE USE PLASTIC IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT SYSTEM FOLLOW REFORM BILL AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND TALKED ABOUT THIS AND TALKED ABOUT. FIXES CALIFORNIA'S ANTIQUATED BEVERAGE CONTAINER REDEMPTION RECYCLING PROGRAM. THE BILL IS THE SAME AS AS BE ONE SIXTY EIGHT WHICH THIS COMMITTEE. REVIEWED AND VOTED ON IN A TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND ONE THAT I AND A CONCEPT THAT I'M COMMITTED TO WORK ON AS IS NECESSARY AS WE GO THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY. SB THREE SEVEN TWO IT'S BASED ON THE INPUT FROM GOVERNOR BROWN'S STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS DURING HIS FINAL TERM. ALSO THIS COMMITTEE'S OVERSIGHT HEARING AT TWENTY SEVENTEEN AS WELL AS THE LA. RIVER IS IN A KELP RECYCLING WHITE PAPER IN CAMINO. CONSUMER WATCHDOGS TRASH IN THE KNOW ME AS REPORT ON THE ROOF REFORM OF A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE THE TIME IS NOW ON THE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE CONTAINER RE PROGRAM WHICH IS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY WHO'D- LIKE THEM. IT'S MINE QUITE A BIT ON THE ORGANS GRAHAM THAT'S WHY WE THOUGHT WE WOULD GIVE YOU A SCAR ON THE- CAN PROGRAM I'M IN. THOSE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS AND THE ADMINISTRATORS PROGRAM ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE. ON IT ONCE TIME TO THE TO BE CLEAR THIS IS HOW ORGANS DOESN'T IMPLEMENT RIGHT COULD BE. UNDER YOUR BILL THERE'S FLEXIBILITY- YEAH THE WHATEVER THE COOPERATIVE THIS DECIDES WE ARE LESSONS LEARNED FROM FROM- ORGAN AND THINGS THAT ARE WORKING AT THINGS THAT ARE NOT WORKING BUT- BUT WE WILL TURN IT OVER TO- THE- BACK. CELL OKAY BEVERAGE. CONTAINER STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION. YOU KNOW ONCE UPON A TIME THE BOTTLE BILL IN CALIFORNIA WAS THAT THE TALK OF THE TOWNIT WAS A NATIONAL LEADER IN RECYCLING WE POST THE- POST ABOUT IT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN PREVENTING BILLIONS OF BOTTLES AND CANS. FROM BECOMING WINNER AND GOING INTO OUR LANDFILL AND BETTER YET MANY THOSE BILLIONS. OF BOTTLES HAVE BEEN RECYCLED SOME SAVING ENERGY AS WE START SAVING WATER SAVING RESOURCES RESOURCES HOWEVER THIRTY YEARS LATER. AND OVER SEVENTY FIVE BILLS THERE BEEN SEVENTY FIVE BILLS ARE AS I LIKE TO SAY SEVENTY FIVE. AND THE STRUCTURE NO LONGER REFLECTS THE NEEDS AND NO LONGER AFFECTS THE CAPABILITIES IT NO LONGER REFLECTS THE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUES. OF THE VALUABLE RESOURCES WHAT CUTTING BACK WICKS NOW THE PREVIOUS PUSH. FOR MAJOR REFORM LAID OUT THREE PRINCIPLES FIRST TO IMPROVE IMPROVING RECYCLING AND REMANUFACTURING SECOND SHARING THE RESPONSIBILITIES LET ME UNDER SCORE THAT SHARING THE RESPONSIBILITIES BETWEEN CONSUMERS MANUFACTURERS DISTRIBUTORS RECYCLABLES CURBSIDE FOLKS WASTE HAULERS MUNICIPALITIES AND ALL OF US. IN THREE ENHANCING ADAPTABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY SO LET'S BREAK THOSE DOWN FOR IMPROVING RECYCLING AND THEN REMANUFACTURING MY BUILT RESTRUCTURES PAYMENTS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECYCLING TO ALLOW MORE STABILITY. AND TO ALLOW MORE FLEXIBILITY. I THEN THE CURRENT SYSTEM THERE BEEN ALSO STE EXPAND THE PROGRAM FOR ONE NINE THE DISTILLED SPIRITS AND THEY ARE INCLUDED. WITH THOSE BEVERAGES HERE IN SB THREE SEVEN TWO BY INCLUDING WINE AND SPIRITS DISTILLED SPIRITS WE INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BOTTLES IN THIS PROGRAM BY NINE HUNDRED BILLION OR NINE HUNDRED MILLION OR BILLION BOTTLES. PER YEAR PER YEAR. SECOND PRINCIPLE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY MY BILL REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS THIS BILL CLOSES THE LOOP RECYCLING AND ENSURES A MARKET FOR RECYCLABLE MATERIALS. REPEAT STOP. INTO THE FUTURE. THE THIRD PRINCIPLE ENHANCING ADAPTABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY SB. PROVIDES THAT PAYMENTS DO NOT NEED TO RELY ON THE FLUCTUATING PRICE OF SCRAP METAL THAT'S ONE REASONS WHY THESE CONVENIENCE CENTERS THAT WERE WORRIED ABOUT WEEK WITH THAT AS A LIMóN GOES DOWN OR IS THE PRICE OF OIL GOES DOWN THERE THE VIRGIN OIL COMES IN WE'RE NOT DOING THAT YOU GET YOU PAY A DIME YOU GET A DIME. DONE AND THEM THE DISTRIBUTORS IN THE MANUFACTURE TAKE CARE AND IF THE ORGANIZATION CHOOSES TO PLAY A FAT TO PROCESSORS AND RECYCLE. THE BILL ALLOWS WHAT'S THE BILL. SEVEN TWO. THE CREATE YOUR BREEDER I'M SUCH A PROGRAM ONE IT INVOLVES ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IT EXPANDS THE PROGRAM TO INCLUDE WINE AND DISTILLED SPIRITS AND THIS IS THE ONE FOR ART LIMITED GOVERNMENT FOLKS IT LIMITS CAL RECYCLES ROLE BUT NOT ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THINGS RECYCLE BUT THEIR HANDS HANDS OFF IT PROVIDES AN INTERIM REPRIEVE FOR THE AND UNSERVED CONVENIENCE ON BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE AND THAT'S SORT OF WHERE THE ACTION IS FAN BUT LEGISLATION AND FINALLY IT REQUIRES CAL RECYCLE TO STATE MINIMUM CONTENT REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTTLES. SIMPLY PUT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH MEMBERS. EVERYONE IS IN THERE ARE NO MORE CARVE OUTS WE'RE DONE WITH THE CAR BALLOTS THAT'S BEEN THE LEGACY OF THIS BOTTLE BILL FOR THE LAST THIRTY. FOR YEARS SEVEN THIRTY THIRTY PLUS YEARS THIRTY PLUS YEARS IN THE STAKEHOLDERS PLAY ON THE SAME PLAYING FIELD AND THE STATE DOES NOT DOES WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO DO THE STATE SETS THE GOAL IT OVERSEAS TO PROGRAM AND WE'RE NOT RUN IN. THE PROGRAM. NOW THE STAKEHOLDERS KNOW THEIR INDUSTRY BASS THEY CAN JOIN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER- STEWARDSHIP. ORGANIZATION OR BACK SO THEY CAN WORK IT OUT THEY CAN NEGOTIATED THEY CAN COME UP WITH THE AGREEMENT OF WHAT THE PLAN IS GOING TO BE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE US. IT'S SB THREE SEVEN TWO IS A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO A COMPLEX PROBLEM. NOW WITH ME TODAY. OH MY GOD. ON THE GOVERNOR OR HE IS MY NEPHEW FOR GOD'S SAKE OKAY IS THIS WITH ME TODAY IS SARAH EDWARDS WITH WHO'S FROM NOMA AND I PUT UP THE REPORT THAT THEY HAVE THE KNOW ME I CAN ONLY A IS THE GREEK GODDESS OF GOOD GOVERNMENT WHAT A GREAT NAME. AS WELL AS AS CHUCK RECALL FROM TARA SO WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I WOULD LIKE MY FIRST WITNESS BEGAN. THANK YOU EIGHT. AM IS WHEN I'M SURPRISED WITH SOME YOU KNOW IDEA EVERY SETTING SO TING WHERE WE THE WORLD'S LEADER THIS CONSOLE TO. ADVISEMENT TO CONSULTANCY IN DEPOSIT SYSTEM SIDE WE HAVE LET'S REVIEWS. THE FIFTY SYSTEMS- OPERATING ACROSS ALLOWED FROM THOSE ACROSS EUROPE TO THOSE IN AUSTRALIA- AND A CAR IN THE PRICES OF DESIGNING SYSTEMS IN THE U. K. INDONESIA. HONG KONG SO WE SIT. AND THAT SHOULD. JUST LET US BY THE TERMS OF THE TYPE. I'M I WE ARE IN SUPPORT THIS BILL AND PRIVATE PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT MAYES TO THAT SHED RESPONSIBILITY MODEL THAT WE SEE THAT SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER OTHER COUNTRIES- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE DID A FULL REVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM THE CALIFORNIA CALLING LEGISLATION IS THE LARGEST PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE'VE SEEN IT CONTAINED ON CONTENDED DEPOSITS IN THE WILD- IT THIS THE PRESCRIPTIVE NATURE THE BILL MIGHT BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MET NEED A NEEDED THANK THE SYSTEM SUSTAINABLE TO TAKE PLACE. AND I THINK THAT OF LIKE HOUSEKEEPER POINTED OUT SOME VERY IMPORTANT POINTS IN TIMES OF HOW WELL OF MONEY- AND THE REST ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND ALL CLEA AFFECTS BUT TO THIS. SUCCESS WHEN THE FUTURE. OF. AB I OUR REVIEW OF THE SYSTEM NINETY THOUSAND ECON LEGISLATION. ACTIVE AB EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT FOUND THAT YOU KNOW IT FILE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE NEXT LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE THAT CONSUMERS NEED TO BE OUT TO HIM AND THE TEAM THAT DEPOSIT AND COLLECT THAT SEE AVE AB UNDRESS SYSTEM THAT WE WOULD PROPOSE AND WE LIKE TO SEE THAT THIS IS A THE LEGISLATION EFFECTIVELY SETS A LEVEL OF REDEMPTION THAT THE SCHEME TO ACHIEVE. THE LEVEL OF RECYCLING I'M I'M REDEMPTION RIGHT AND ALLOWS THE PRODUCES AND THE STEWARDS TO AFFECT WE PUT IN PLACE THE MOST EFFECTIVE NETWORK OF REDEMPTION. AND POINTS TO ALLOW THAT I'M SYSTEM TO. HE PUT IN PLACE AND THAT LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE AND PLACES AB OWNERSHIP ON THE PRODUCES TONIGHT SO THAT THE NUMBER OF REDEMPTION POINTS AND PROVIDES A LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE- WITH OF THE CITY CODE WHAT HOUSE THE BILL ALSO ALLOWS FULL. I'M AN AMENDMENT IN THE DEPOSIT LEVEL THAT WILL ALLOW AND THAT TO BE TO BE AMENDED IF FOR- FOR INSTANCE THE ABDUCTION RIGHT FOR THIS I'LL ADMIT NECESSARY STRATEGY- REQUIREMENT. SO IN IN ESSENCE WE SUPPORT THE BILL IT'S NICE TO MOVE THAT THAT RESPONSIBILITY MODEL I'M AND I'M BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SOME. AMENDMENTS THE NEEDING TO THE CURRENT DRAFTING TO MAKE IT A SEAT WILL BILL FIVE EXIST BY THAT IN CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THIS IS JAMIE QUIRK. FROM CONSUMER WATCH I DIDN'T LOOK OVER I WAS SO GALVANIZED ON MY SLIDES. MY NEXT WITNESS. HI JAMIE COURT PRESIDENT CONSUMER WATCHDOG I'LL KEEP IT REAL SIMPLE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS PAY ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS IN NICKELS AND DIMES AND WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF BACK THE OFFICIAL REDEMPTION STATE THE NUMBER FROM CAL RECYCLE NOW IS SIXTY EIGHT PERCENT. WE BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY LOWER. IN OREGON IT'S THE 1% IN MICHIGAN IT'S 89% IN GERMANY IT'S 98% AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY ALL DO ONE THING THAT WE DON'T DO AND IT'S WE TELL THE BEVERAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE PROFITING FROM THE RAPPERS FROM THE CANS BOTTLES THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR RECYCLING THAT IS THE CONCEPT BEHIND THE BILL THAT WE SUPPORT. AND WE THINK SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND BECOME LAW AND I THINK EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL SUPPORT THAT CONCEPT SO I REALLY THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT'S THE CONCEPT TO KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE ABOUT THIS BILL AND WE HOPE DO. LIKE ALL RETAILERS HAVE TO ACCEPT. I WAS ON CAMPUS. AS WE BUY BOTTLES AND CANS IN RETURN IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WORKS. IT'S SIMPLE IT'S CONVENIENCE WOULD LIKE THAT TO BE IN THIS BILL. WE'D LIKE TO SEE- CURBSIDE HOLLERS WERE GETTING PAID NOW FOR TWELVE PERCENT. OF OUR NICKELS AND DIMES NOT GET THAT PAYMENT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T GET IN ANYWHERE ELSE AND THEY'RE NOT AUDITED I GOT TO TALK TO COVER CYCLE ABOUT IT. BUT THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE CAN ALL KEEP THAT IN MIND EVEN AS YOU'RE HEARING THE OPPOSITION. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE LAST THING I'LL SAY THAT I HOPE HAPPENS WITH THIS BILL HOPE HAPPENS THIS YEAR IS THERE ARE RECYCLERS WE HAVE HALF THE RECYCLING CENTERS WE DID. YOU KNOW A DECADE AGO- AND- THEY'VE CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT AN ADEQUATE PAYMENTS ARE HIGHER RENT THEIR SARS MEN WHICH BUT THE ONES THAT HAVE. HIGH QUALITY HIGH VOLUME THESE ARE CENTERS THAT ARE PRODUCING. AND THEY EXIST IN THE SYSTEM THEY SHOULD BE REWARDED. AND UNTIL WE TRANSITION TO THE SYSTEM WE NEED TO PAY THEM. WE GOT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE BANK FROM HUNDRED TEAM DEPOSIT. LET'S PAY THEM TO KEEP DOING THIS JOB AND WE'LL- DO THIS NEW SYSTEM. LET'S MAKE SURE. THAT THEY HAVE FIRST DIBS. WITH THEM. AND I THINK IF WE- WERE GONNA REDUCE A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. AND WE'RE GONNA CHANGE ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE OR IN A 90% RETENTION RATE WE'RE SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT PROTECTING THE CONSUMERS. THERE ARE THAT MANY WHEN WHEN'S IN THIS BUILDING THIS BILL. BE THAT AND I THINK- IF ONE UNDERSTAND THE GOVERNOR WANTS THAT AS WELL. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INDULGING IN THIS IT'S REALLY REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. TO CONSUMERS I JUST INVITE. I DON'T.

BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT I GUESS WITH SOBRE WITH EXPECTATION THAT IF THE- IF THERE IS A REAL CONSIDERATION FOR REAL REFORM RATHER THAN FIXES- THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER REINVESTING IN THIS MARKET. THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED.

ONCE YOU WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE SHERIN MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENT OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- THERE ARE THREE. CONCEPTS IN THIS BILL THAT I'M SUPPORTING- I'M SUPPORTING THIS CONCEPT OF GREATER PRODUCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COST RECYCLING- I'M SUPPORTING CONCEPT OF. NEW AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE FOR MINIMUM RECYCLED CONTENT. AND THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF THE LAW- TO INCLUDE ONE STILL SPIRITS ALL THOSE ARE GOOD FEATURES OF THIS. I JUST HAVE TO CLARIFY TWO POINTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE PRESENTATION NUMBER ONE. NO TAX DOLLARS ARE USED IN THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM TO FUND THE RECYCLING PROGRAM. IS ENTIRELY PAID FOR BY SEPARATE THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY AND BEVERAGE CANS. SECONDLY I LIKE THE FACT THAT OUR OUR PROGRAM ALLOWS ME TO PUT BEVERAGE CONTAINERS IN MY CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM AND THAT I'VE PAID THE REFUND VALUE ON. AND THE VALUE OF THAT REFUND VALUE OF CREWS TO HELP OFFSET THE RATE TO THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING THAT'S A GOOD FEATURE OF OUR PROGRAM AND I HOPE THAT THIS POLICY IF THERE IS A PLAN AND IF IT MOVES FORWARD. THAT WE WOULDN'T GET RID OF THAT FEATURE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S FAIR CONSUMER. THAT WANT TO USE. A RECYCLING PROGRAM. THANKS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOU ARE ON WE HAVE YOU ON AS IN SUPPORT THE OKAY I JUST SAID HERE THE THREE THINGS ABOUT BUILDING I'M SUPPORTING. RIGHT THANK YOU OR SO KILLS HERE ON BEHALF OF NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL WORST PART OF THE INTENT OF THE BILL WE- WE APOLOGIZE FOR A LETTER ON TO LAND A LETTER BUT WE SUPPORT THE INTENT TO COMPREHENSIVELY CLEAN UP THE STATUE AND PROBABLY FIX THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I CAN YOU ALONG WITH MEANS RECYCLING HOW WE OPERATE RECYCLING CENTER- LOCALLY HERE IN SACRAMENTO- FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS- AND ALSO- THREE PROCESSING FACILITIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE CONCEPT WITH THIS BILL- BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT THAT WE NEED TO HAVE- INPUT I THINK FROM THE STAKEHOLDER OFTEN PEOPLE LIKE US. I TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A SEAT ON THE TABLE- YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN RIGHT NOW. I WITH A LOT OF CUSTOMERS THAT WE DEAL WITH YOU KNOW HIS PROGRAM. THIS IS ALL PM AND THE BACKDROP. PLACE ALL EXIST RECYCLING CENTER NOT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAVING THESE. IT IS HELLO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE HOW THAT'S GONNA YOU KNOW. HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK- IS IT GONNA YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY GONNA CONCERNED A LIVELIHOOD OF ART YOU KNOW I BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW. IF YOU. IS RESOURCES HAYWARD AND WITH PROTECT CRV AND AGAIN WE DO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THREE SEVENTY TWO BOB WHEN WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH ALL THE RECYCLING CENTERS CLOSE SEEN IN THE SUMMER WE HAD ONE SENATOR COME TO OUR FACILITY ND I WAS CENTER WHITE HOUSE SKI- SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT RESPONDED TO THE NEEDS OF RECYCLING CENTERS SO- TAKING A STEP FORWARD AND SERVER FROM WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT THAT. THINGS WERE PERSON IN THE PROCESS OF. APPLYING FOR ONE. MS PRODUCED BACKDROP PROGRAM. WITH A PATENTED PROCESS TO THE CITY OF WHOLESOME AND- TO THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY AREAS OF ARDEN ARCADE CARMICHAEL SO REDUCE TO SUPPORT IT. ANY JUST MENTION BEFORE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT- THERE'S A GOOD TRANSITION FOR THE EXISTING RECYCLING CENTERS THANK YOU YEP. YEP OKAY. I LET'S HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. IF I MAY I MEN WHAT WHAT WAS SO WHERE THE LEAD TO DO YOU GUYS HAVE SOME LEAD. THE TV ORGANIZED OKAY WHAT THE TWO OF YOU COME UP THEN AND YOU CAN JOINED DEREK AND I AM NEITHER AND SUPPORT NOR OPPOSITION OKAY. YOU ARE MOST AMERICANS. YEAH YEAH IS IT ALRIGHT SELLING- SURE SURE IT WAS HERE WHAT'S YOUR TENS UNIT YOU CAN COME UP AND HAVE SIX I'M SUSAN COLLINS FROM THE CONTAINER RECYCLING INSTITUTE- AND WE APPLIED- THE VISION OF THIS BILL AND MANY DETAILED PROVISIONS OF THE PROPOSED NEW PROGRAM ARE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND TRULY WORLD CLASS AND THERE ARE NOW MORE THAN SIXTY CONTAINER DEPOSIT LAWS WORLDWIDE BECAUSE AT BELARUS WAS SENT OUT YESTERDAY THEY BECAME NUMBER SIXTY ONE. AND THE LAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS. BEVERAGE CAN DEPOSIT BOSS HAS. THREE HUNDRED MILLION PEOPLE THE YEAR TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION ONCE THESE NEW PROGRAMS ARE ALL IMPLEMENTED. AND HIS UNIQUE NO OTHER CONTAINER DEPOSIT PROGRAM IN THE WORLD HAS LOST HALF ITS INFRASTRUCTURE THE PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE THE CURRENT PROGRAM OUR UNIQUE TO THE STRUCTURE AND INFLEXIBILITY OF CALIFORNIA'S LAW. SO AGAIN WHILE WE APPLAUD THE VISION FOR THE NEW PROGRAM THAT WOULD GO INTO PLACE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO PEOPLE AND- REFUNDS IN THE INTERVENING FOR YEARS. I'M WE'VE GOT THESE RECYCLING DESERT IN THE STATE. HELP IS NEEDED WE'VE LOST HALF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE WE LOST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SITES LAST YEAR WE LOST IN ELEVEN SITES JUST IN THE LAST MONTH. THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER REDEMPTION CENTERS. UNDERPAID SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A CRAZY PAYMENT FORMULA WHERE THE PAYMENTS ARE DOWN 20% OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. BUT THEIR COSTS ARE UP 20% OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF COURSE THAT TEN WORKABLE. AND AS A RESULT CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE COLLECTING IS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION MORE IN DEPOSIT REFUNDS NOW THAN THEY ARE BUT THEY CAN'T BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE WORD ANYWHERE TO GO. WE NEED PAYMENTS HAWAII HAS MADE TO CHANGE AND THEY'RE SHORING. STRUCTURE SO IF THEY CAN'T DO IT I THINK WE CAN TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO YOU BUT THOUGHT THE ORGAN. IF YOU SPEND TIME LEVEL. GO DUCKS YEAH ALL RIGHT YES. GOOD MORNING RIGHT SO TIM'S MOTHER REPRESENTING WINE INSTITUTE- WE'RE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION- TODAY TO THIS LEGISLATION UP. I GUESS A ALSO THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SAY ABOUT IT- WE ARE IN AGREEMENT I ACTUALLY THE- THE GENTLEMAN FROM THE CONSUMER WATCHDOG I PICKED OUT THE SAID PRETTY WELL THE OPPOSITE TEN AGREES WITH THE YOU KNOW REFORM OF THIS ANTIQUATED PROGRAM IS LAW. OR DO WE RE WITHOUT. WE ALSO IN GREECE RE THAT INDUSTRIES LED. CHEN IS A BETTER MODEL THAN THAN WHAT WE SEEN UNDER CAL RECYCLE UNFORTUNATELY KINDA HARD STOP THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE- SO FAR OF. GERMAN ALLEN IS AS YOU'RE AWARE. OUR OUR INDUSTRY AND OUR FRIENDS- HAVE BEEN COMMITTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO WORKING WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF YOUR LEGISLATION- THAT'S BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW AND WHILE WE'RE NOT THERE YET. WE THINK THAT THAT ALLOWS FOR THE FLEXIBILITY THAT WOULD. MANAGE OUR PRODUCTS- WE STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THE NOTION THAT A DEPOSIT REFUND SYSTEM WORKS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND AS- I THINK YOU NOTED WINE BOTTLES CURRENTLY AREN'T PART OF THE OREGON PROGRAM. AND JUST TO MAKE THAT VERY REAL FOR WHY THAT PROBABLY IS- IF YOU DID THIS BAG PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WINE BOTTLES ARE VERY HAPPY SPIRITS BALLS- SAME DEAL- TO GET A FIVE DOLLAR REFUND THROUGH THE ORGAN SYSTEM IT SEEMS THAT WOULD BE LIKE AND SET THE BOTTLE. AND IT'S LIKE OVER A FIFTY POUND BAG BUT YOU'D BE ASKING THE HOLLOW SOUND. AND WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT THE INCIDENT ALL OF YOU BE IN ONE OF ACCESS TO RECYCLING. WE FEEL THE DIALOGUE NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON TWELVE ACCESS TO RECYCLING THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THAT- I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE. MOVING BEYOND THE DEPOSIT REFUND SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND FOCUSING ON IMPROVING THE CONVENIENCE TO CONSUMERS. AND GETTING RID OF THIS INSTANTLY COMPLEX AND ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT WE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE WITH THE EXISTING BOTTLED. SO I CAN SEE THAT WE FIND IT UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED- PLAN IN THE MANNER ANTI MEAN AND IS IT AS IT WAS- YOUR YOUR CHOICE OBVIOUSLY SENATOR. BUT WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A MUCH BROADER DISCUSSED AND- THAT WERE AT THE TABLE OR RIGHT NOW AND WE HOPE THAT THIS DOESN'T DISTRACT FROM THAT CONVERSATION. SO WITHOUT- I REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE HOLD THE BILL RIGHT NOW AND HOW IT. OKAY I ONE OF HIS CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OUR POSITION. CAN COME TO MY. YOU CAN SAY TO MY PHONE ORGAN. SIR CAN. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARK A PRAYER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND WE- WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE MEASURE BUT AS WE'VE EXPRESSED TO THE AUTHOR WITH WHOM WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE AND WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS THOSE. TO THE COMMITTEE. I THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- I THINK THAT THE C. R. V. PROGRAM CERTAINLY HAS ITS PROBLEMS AND HE THAT IS. WITHOUT THE NILE- BUT THAT DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS THE CURRENT CRV PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO CAL RECYCLES LATEST FIGURES. IS SEVENTY FIVE POINT EIGHT PERCENT. RECYCLING RATE. THAT IS HIGHER THAN ANY E. P. R. PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHEN PEOPLE POINT TO OREGON THE SUCCESS IN OREGON IN OUR OPINION IS NOT BECAUSE OF THE ARE IT IS BECAUSE IT'S AT TEN CENTS. AT AND THAT THAT TEN CENT REDEMPTION BY YOU IS WHAT IS CAUSING THAT SUCCESS TO A IT THE E. P. R. OP. ART CONCERN SHOULD BE EXPRESSED THIS WAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A FORTY MILLION OF POPULATION OREGON HAS FOUR MILLION. AND THOSE COMPARISONS ARE IMPORTANT NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF SIZE BUT THE DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION AND THE LARGENESS OF THE GEOGRAPHY IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO OREGON. AND SO AT THE END WE'D LIKE TO SAY THAT WE WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT WE NOT THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER- AND- AS THIS MAY MEASURE MOVES FORWARD. THAT THERE BE CONSIDERATION AS TO WHAT'S REALLY DRIVING THE SUCCESS OF OTHER PROGRAMS AND THAT WE NOT JUST SIMPLY WALK AWAY FROM THE CURRENT PROGRAM THANK YOU. YEAH MR MEMBERS SAID KEVIN THE QUEUE UP. THE DISTILLED SPIRITS COUNCIL WE FULLY ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE WINE INSTITUTE COMMENTS ON OUR ON GOING WORK WITH YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. AS WELL AS MISS GETS ALSO ON THE OTHER SIDE THERE. YEAH CHAIRED MEMBERS IN THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTIC RECYCLING CORPORATION OF CALIFORNIA WE DID GET OUR LETTER IN LATE SO WE APOLOGIZE WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. I STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE TIM SCHNAUZER I IN CONCEPT PHILOSOPHICALLY WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH INDUSTRY LED DEPOSIT PROGRAM HOWEVER WE DO BELIEVE- THE CURRENT. PROGRAM DOES NEED IMMEDIATE MODIFICATIONS IN THE INTERIM WHILE WALKING ON THE U. CONCEPTS THANK YOU. MELISSA ONE. FAMILY ONE MAKERS OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT IS NOW AND WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE WINE INSTITUTE THANK YOU. FOR WINTER MEMBERS MICHAEL MILLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION WONDER GROWERS. WE SUCH YOURSELVES IN THE COMMENTS OF MISTER SCHMELZER AND RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED ASK ME TO HOLD THE BILL THANK YOU. DAVID KRIEGER CALIFORNIA BEER BEVERAGE DISTRIBUTORS ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR MANY REASONS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD THANK YOU. THESE AS YOU HAVE THE BEER BEVERAGE AND YOU GUYS HAVE A DIFFERENT ISSUE IN TERMS OF THE WEIGHT OF THE BOTTLES I GUESS COLLECTIVELY. IT MEANS IS THAT IS THAT IT. THIS IS THIS IS AN THAT YOUR FOLKS UP IN OREGON BUT JUST. DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS ON. THE EXPERIENCE IN OREGON. FOR YOUR INDUSTRY- NO NOT AT THE MOMENT BUT YET WE DO HAVE A LETTER IN THAT DETAILED SOME OF THE CONCERNS OVER THAT- BUT I DON'T THINK THE WAY IS THE- IS THE HEART OF THAT ISSUE. WHAT SO WITH OUR THAT FOR YOU. THAT'S BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT ON IT OKAY OKAY WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AND FOLLOW UP. SIR OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY I. THINK YOUR BODY ANYONE ANY OF THIS FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND. SO LET ME START WITH IS THE QUESTION I GUESS. YOU KNOW WE'VE ONE OF THE THINGS WE STRUGGLE WITH THIS COMMITTEE- WITH WITH EXTENDED PLEASE RESPONSIBLY PROGRAMS AS BANDSMEN FORSMAN CHALLENGES. AND IN OF ONE OF YOUR SUPPORT WITNESSES WANNA COME UP WE CAN JUST HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE HERE AT THE AT THE TABLE. YOU WILL RECEIVE YOUR YOUR SEATS. CONCERN WITHIN INDUSTRY HOW DO YOU WHAT WHAT WHAT IF WE RUN INTO A SIMILAR ENFORCEMENT ISSUES. WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. THIS WOULD BE PASSING A LAW. GIVEN WHAT WE SEEN WITH CARPETS AND MATTRESSES AND IN SOME OF THE OTHER. SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT I'VE BEEN OUT THERE WITH THE PR SO FAR. WELL I GUESS. HOW THE CARPET THE PAINT AND THE MATTRESS. XNA BUT HIS RESPONSIBILITIES ARE ARE- PIONEERING EFFORTS TO CALIFORNIA'S MAKING THE BOTTLE RECYCLING IS NOT I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE CUTTING EDGE ON CARPET AND I ADMIT YOU KNOW YOUR PARTIES WILL BE BUILDING WILL BE BUILDING OFF OF WHAT THE WORLD HAS BEEN DOING IN RECYCLING BOB. WAS THERE'S I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE AN OLD SHE DON'T KNOW HOW TO OF PURSES VERSUS A WINE BOTTLE AND OUT OR A OR A SODA BOTTLE SO THERE'S A DIFFERENT CONTEXT THAT WE HAVE A WE HAVE. SUCCESS OUR NOBLE. MATCH RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD THAT ARE SUCCESS THAT WE CAN SAY WE'RE GONNA BE. OURS TO DO THAT SO IT IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. TO YOU SIR DO YOU HAVE YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT A MODERN SYSTEM MOVES TO A TECHNOLOGY BASED SYSTEM. I MEAN YOU SAW SOME OF THE IN OREGON BUT YOU ALSO SEE THAT YOU KNOW THAT IN TIMES OF THIS CENTURY. I'M PRETTY SOLID STEWARDSHIP SO THEY CAN. WRITE MEANT THERE IS I'M SO THAT'S NOT CROSS BORDER FRAUD FOR INSTANCE THAT IT IN OTHER ORGANS HAVE INVESTED IN LOOKING AT LAYS REDEMPTION POINTS AT ON THE FORD WITH THEM IT STATES THAT DON'T HAVE A- A DEPOSIT SYSTEM. AND THERE'S ALSO A MECHANISM TO ALLOW A TECHNOLOGY BASED SYSTEMS OF EVERY EVERY FACTORY EVERY CONTAINER THE GUYS WHO THIS IS VERIFIED. BY THE THROUGH AN OFF YET OR SENT TO. THE. HE TRIED TO FORTUNATELY. PLAY THE SYSTEM. SO THAT EFFECTIVELY HELP. AND RALPH SOFT POLICE EACH OTHER. IN IN A CONFERENCE ROOM RIGHT MISTER CHAIR IS THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS THE FOUNDATION IS THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE INNOVATION. AS AS WE'VE- MENTIONED THAT WE GIVE TO THE COOPERATIVE THEY'RE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT. ARE GOING TO DESIGN THIS AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO THEY NEED BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THEY WILL BE. RESPONSIBLE AND I THINK ULTIMATELY WHEN YOU HAVE A AND A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT SO RESPONSIBILITY UNDER THIS BILL THERE SO WHAT'S POSSIBILITY WOULD BE. TO AUDIT. TO VERIFY TO COME TO SHOW THIS COMPLIANCE. IT MAKES ME IT MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A MORE DEDICATED AGENCY THAT'S LOOKING AT ONE THING. SHOW THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM TO SHOW THE PUSH. REGISTERING CORRECTLY TO ENSURE THAT THE- RECYCLING RIGHTS BEING AT SO THAT I CAN THEN AND- IT IS NOT BEING. MET. EIGHT EIGHT INFO BECAUSE THANKS IS THE TENSION OF THE AGENCY. THE TO DO. WHAT'S YOUR I WHAT THIS DOES THE EXISTING RECYCLING CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE WELL THAT TO THE COOPERATIVE I MEAN IF THEIR THIRST TO TH THIS IS A LONG TERM FIX OKAY THIS IS THE BIG FIX IN THE INTERIM WE HAVE ALL THESEWE HAVE CAL RECYCLE SITTING ON THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE COLLECTED BECAUSE BECAUSE MY INFORMATION SAYS THAT CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WE'RE RECYCLING 66% OF OUR PRODUCT COMES IN THE THAT ALUMINUM OFF THE CHARTS BECAUSE AT THAT SAID BUT THE BOTTLES AND CANS PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY NOT DOING IT THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE. FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE WEEKEND AND WE'RE GONNA BE LESS THAN A TWO THIRDS OF RISK LABOR OUR GOAL IS 80% IT'S A FAILURE SO WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS THIS THIS WHATEVER IS GOOD FIGURE IS GOOD IF YOU'RE NOT IF IT'S IF IT'S WORKING I JUST OFFERED THE OREGON MODEL THE BOTTLE DROP OFF AS IT IDEA IT CAN BE THEY'RE GOING TO IT'S PRIVATE INDUSTRY THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WORKS BEST IN THESE DIFFERENT AREAS THEY MAY GO WITH THAT A DIFFERENT MODEL FOR PEOPLE TO. DROP OFF. WAR IS. SOPHISTICATED NO I THINK THAT RESPECT TEAM IT ANSWER THE TECHNOLOGY BUT BUT. I'M JUST YEAH I JUST GOT THE LEGISLATION THEY'RE GOING TO RUN IT CAN I JUST MAKE A POINT THAT ULTIMATELY- DISTRICT PEOPLE WITH IDEATION IS GONNA HAVE TO HAVE AS MANY REDEMPTION POINTS- AS NECESSARY TO BE THE TARGET SO THEY ARE GOING TO BE ENCOURAGING THE EXISTING REDEMPTION NETWORK TO STAY IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT'S WELL KNOWN. THE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE EXISTING AND REDEMPTION BUT THE NECESSARY COST TO KEEP THEM IN OPERATION. THEY ARE GOING TO COVER THAT COST SO EFFECTIVELY THEY THEY'LL DOES NOT WAY BILL ONE IN INFO JUST CLOSED OUT WITH THE HAVE A TARGET TO ME. TO MEET AND THEY HAVE TO BRING ALL THE REDEMPTION RENTAL. THIS FEATURE SO WE UNDERSTAND. ORGAN HAS TEN TIMES THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA AND TODAY THEY HAVE TWENTY. TWICE AS MANY REDEMPTION CENTERS. IN A WE HAVE ONE CHANCE I MEAN. CALIFORNIA HAS TEN TIMES POPULATION. THEY HAVE TWICE AS MANY REDEMPTION CENTERS SO- THIS CONCERN IT'S A GOOD. YOU KNOW AGAIN WE HAVE. YOU KNOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S GOT WILLIAM CARP. YEAH IF THE CURBSIDE RECYCLING PROGRAM IS SO GREAT. THEN COOPERATIVE WILL SAY WELL WHAT ARE. WE CAN. TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT FIFTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS MISTER COURTS- REPORT AND IN THE MIA EVERY PORT ON THAT WE'RE SPENDING THAT MONEY AND WE'RE ALSO FOR CAL RECYCLE JST SEE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE PICKING THOSE PENSIONS AND THOSE BENEFITS SO THAT'S GOING TO BE THAT'S COULD BE PROP INDUSTRIES THIS IS SO HOW HOW CLOSE IS THE THIS MORE OF WHAT THE NUMBERS COLOMBIA'S. PRETTY FAR. IN DISTRICT. EIGHT SCOTT BEYOND IT WORKS ALONGSIDE THE EPL APPROACH. OF THE PACKAGING MATERIALS I MEAN I EXPERIENCE IS THAT TO GET THE MAXIMUM LEVEL OF RISK LIKE WE GET TO REACH THE HIGHEST LEVEL RECYCLING YOU WANT ANY PL SYSTEM. ADVOCATE SEPARATE CONTAINER DEPOSIT SYSTEM BECAUSE I SYSTEMS COULD CHEAT IN EXCESS OF NINETY PERCENT. AND YOU HAVE A ANY PIAF BY CUTS LIKE PROGRAM. OF AND THAT'S SYSTEM THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AND DON'T TABBY I DON'T REALLY HAVE. A FIFTY PERCENT FUNDED EPL CURBSIDE. MODEL WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO HIT. THE 70% WITH A PACKING RIGHT. THEY SEE THAT ALREADY WITH DEPOSITS CAN I MEET AT HIGH LEVELS RECYCLING. BUT THEY'VE MADE THAT DECISION. TO GO THAT ROUTE IT WASN'T IMPOSED UPON THEM THEY JUST. THAT WAS WHAT THE LEGISLATION ALSO OFFICE VILLAGES IS A CIRCLE ECONOMY EFFECT LEGISLATION IN ONTARIO SO QUICKLY ME ACT REQUIRES THAT THEY- ON TERRY HASTERT SAID BE POLICY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO CONCEDE TO A EIGHTY ALL AT AS MODELS ARE ONLY IT'S FIFTY FIFTY. FUNDED BY HIS APOLOGIES IS MOVING TO A HOT AND FUNDED WATER. AND OUT. ON THE SENATE BY PRODUCES PRODUCES RIGHT OKAY. I'M HOW DO YOU SEE THE CONVERSE JUST THIS QUEST THE AUTHOR I MEAN CONVERSATION MOVING. ON THIS BILL WITH BEER AND WINE. MY LOOK FOR TO THIS CONVERSATIONS WITH BEER AND WINE- NO I THINK. YOU KNOW THE OR THE ORGAN FOR THE YOU KNOW NOT WOOD ST WE HAVE WERE AGAIN WINE INDUSTRY WANTS TO JOIN THE PROGRAM SO IT AGAIN IT'S TWELVE YEARS OF ITS MATURE BUT THEY WANT TO GO IN ON THE PROGRAM AS FAR AS THE WEIGHTS CONCERN. YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS PICKED UP AT THE RESTAURANT IT'S PICKED UP AT THAT YOU KNOW IT'S YOU CAN YOU CAN SINGULARLY PROPERTY AND- I'M- TOTALLY CONFIDENT THAT THE- FIGURE OUT WHAT THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE WITH WITH WEIGHT IT'S NOT A REASON TO STOP ALL THE ALL THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE WIND INDUSTRY THE DISTILLED SPIRITS HAVE. OUT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CONGRATULATIONS THAT'S THAT'S OKAY OUR HISTORY BECAUSE WE WANTED TO THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM WHAT HAVE OF EVERYBODY ALL AND NOW WE'RE SITTING TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE'RE ALL IN WORK WITH THEM ON THE RE BOTTLE WHAT THE HELL THEY WERE. INVOLVED IN ALL THAT WILL FIGURE OUT PRIVATE INDUSTRY WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THIS CAN WORK BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD FROM ONE OF THE FULLER WANT TO HAVE THIS KATIE WHERE WE WANT TO THE CIRCLE ON ME AND RECYCLING IN. ALL ONE HUNDRED NINETY FIVE COUNTRIES EVERY JURISDICTION UP WITH THAT HOW WE GET END OF LIFE PROGRAMS WITH A BOTTLE BECAUSE BOTTLES AND CANS AND PLASTIC SWORDS AT LEAST IN THE CONSTRUED PART SIMPLEST THING AND THERE'S MONEY THERE RIGHT SAY ONE THING ALL THE WAY BACK SO. I'M WAIT I KNOW IN OTHERS TO HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IS IN THAT. BUT HE'S HOLDING. OFF TO BE INTRODUCED THIS DEPOSIT SYSTEMS AND I STATES BECAUSE GLOSS HAS THAT SHE KNOWS VALUE AND IS COLLECTED FOR CUTS LIKE COLLECTION PROCESS AND MOST MOST MUNICIPALITIES A HAVING TO HIGH GLOSS COLLECTED FOOD DEPOSITS IS A BREAK SINCE CONTAMINATE THE BASIC CONTAMINATED GETS MIXED ECONOMIC HYPOXIA SO I SHOULD THE ARGUMENT OTHER STATES WAS SAYING IS PLEASE INTO CHIU SMOKE OFTEN PART OF THAT SYSTEM BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT AND I CUTLASSES RAISE IT HAS NO VALUE IS PAYING A COST ON TO ACT LIKE SINCE. RIGHT THERE. HI I TAUGHT IT FOR THE FULL TIME FOR THAT TO. YOUR YEAH SENATE YEAH. SO HEARING WE LIKE THE VENDOR. DEPOSIT SYSTEM OR THE VENDING MACHINE DEPOSIT SYSTEM I AM IN OREGON- BC WALK TAKE ME BACK THROUGH IT SO WHAT WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE I SHARE A BOTTLE OF WINE DRINK IT IT'S EMPTY I DON'T PUT IT IN THE BIN AND CURBSIDE I TAKE IT TO YOU HAVE A VENDING MACHINE AND POP IT IN THE- VAN MáS ME BACK. THE TODAY YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT. HE WOULD. BECAUSE LIKE. TIED UP BUT IN YOUR CASE IF YOU WANTED TO PUT IT BACK TAKE IT TO A RETAIL STORE TO AN IBM TO GET YOUR CAR SO I GOT A LIGHT BUT I GOTTA GET MY CAR AND DRIVE IT SOME WHERE YOU ONLY WHO'S GOT THE SUPERMARKET I YOU KNOW. NO I'M NOT YOU DON'T SHOW NO I'M GOING NO I'M USING THE INTERNET OKAY I GO TO COURT AND THAT'LL ANYWAY I'M SORRY YEAH YES I KNOW YOU KNOW MAYBE. A BUSINESS SET UP. COLLECT PEOPLE'S ON THEIR. ON MY ON LINE YOU KNOW. THE A PROGRAMS ONLINE AND- SILOS DISPUTED IS. PRESENT A LITTLE OUT OF HAVING TO COULD BE CALLED. BIG CORPORATIONS THAT PROGRAMS WHETHER THAT'S WHETHER THEY CUT HIS MATERIALS. I'M FROM YOUR HOME OR WHERE THEY SAT UPON THE SHIPS WHERE YOU CAN TAKE THOSE CONTAINERS BACK. FOR THAT PROGRAM SO. ONLINE SALAS IS BECOMING. INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PART FOR YOU DO YOU SEE A LOT OF MILLENNIALS I GO I WENT. OVER AND YOU SEE PEOPLE. SHOWING UP WITH THE AND THAT'S LIKE TO. COLLECT BLESSED IN THE IN THE GARAGE IN THE- ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS WILL SHOW UP IN THE DITCH POPULOUS OF IN THE NIGHT YEAH. THE A TWENTY BUCKS OR WHAT YOU KNOW AND THEN IT. JUST ADDS. TO ALL PUBLIC. DOES COST YES I'M. LOOK AT THE- AGE TO. SEE WHAT. FOR SO THAT'S- I DON'T. PEOPLE CYCLE. ALL OF THE WORLD THAT IS. THEY DO IT EVEN IF THEY GET THEIR FOOD DELIVER TO THEM. AT THEIR AT THEIR HOUSE SO WE'RE SAYING. STEP BACK THIS COOPERATIVE THAT WE'RE SETTING UP IN CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO RUN IT THE WAY THAT THEY WANT TO RUN IT THEY CAN USE CURBSIDE THEY CAN USE EXISTING FACILITIES I JUST SAID AS AN AS AN OFFER OF EXAMPLE SURE COOPERATIVE IN OREGON BY ALL THEIR PROPERTIES THEY THEY BY OTHER PROPERTIES THEY CALL LOCATE SOME OF THESE THINGS ON EXISTING. I'D SAY THEY DON'T WANT TO RURAL AREAS AND COAL OKAY THEY THEY THEY DO WHATEVER THEY WANT THEY HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. SO THE- INNOVATIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING AROUND THE WORLD ARE THESE REVERSE VENDING MACHINES BECAUSE YOU'RE SO SIMPLE YOU JUST POP IN YOUR- YOUR- YOUR- GLASS. YOUR GLASS AND YOU GET IT- SOME PEOPLE. YOU KNOW ANY COUNTED THAT THE MACHINE WILL DO WHATEVER ONCE AND IT'S GREEN AND IT'S CLEAR. OTHERS THEY'VE GONE WITH THIS GREEN BAG IN BLUE BACK PROGRAM WERE ALLOWS MILLENNIALS ARE NOT MILLENNIAL STE WE GET TO TAG THEIR BAGS AND DROP IT OFF WHEN THEY GO IN. AND THEY HAVE THEIR DISTRIBUTORS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE SINCE THEIR RIGHT PROGRAM SO WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE GUY WE'LL SANTA. SIX CRAIG. BEER AND WINE AND SPORTS DRINKS THEY COME BACK OUT WITH WITH THEIR THEIR EMPTIES THEIR EMPTY SAVE GOT THAT THEY FIGURED IT OUT AND IS WORKING FINE. IT'S FINE- THAT THAT NOT OUR COOPERATIVE WILL DO WHATEVER THEY WANT TO DO WHICH EVER BEST FOR CALIFORNIA I'M JUST OFFERING IS AN EXAMPLE SURE. SO ANOTHER WOULD MECHANICS WISE FOR THE BILL I APOLOGIZE HAVE NOT READ THE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE PAGES. BUT YOUR MEN OF FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF COLLECTION PROCESSING RECYCLING BUT YOU'RE MAKING A POLICY DECISION ABOUT THE HOW IT HOW THE FEES ARE GENERATE THE ACTUAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT'S WHERE THE BILL IS SORT OF STAYING WE'RE GONNA DO ANY P. R. MODEL THAT PUSH IT ALL UPSTREAM WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT COULD BE A CURBSIDE FUTURE COULD BE A VENDING MACHINE FUTURE COULD BE A BLUE BACK RIGHT BUT- BUT THAT'S SORT OF THE- POLICY CHOICE IN YEARS YOU'RE SAYING. I'M AT LIKE A STRIP. E. P. R. MODEL WHERE YOU'RE ASSESSING IT ON WHOEVER THE BEVERAGE- SORRY THE EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY YEAH SO LIKE YOU'RE PUSHING IT THE CONSUMERS AND BEARING THAT COST IN YOUR FRAMEWORK YOUR YOUR NOT LOOKING FOR A SHARED OR A SPLIT EACH IS SOLELY ON THE MY CENTER I THINK PRODUCER OR THE DISTRIBUTOR DISTRIBUTOR NINE SAYS SO THAT'S THAT'S FIX THOUGH THAT'S NOT FLEXIBLE RIGHT SO NINETY EIGHT POINT SOMETHING OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLY JUST GETTING GETTING RATED THE CODE. THAT HAS GOT IS A PRODUCT OF THE ORIGINAL ACT AND SEVENTY FIVE OTHER BILLS JUST DELETE DELETE DELETE DELETE OKAY SO THIS BILL IN CONCEPT IS ELEGANTLY SIMPLE BECAUSE IT GIVES THE ULTIMATE FLEXIBILITY TO THIS PROPERTY WE JUST SAID HERE SOME TIME LINE. YOU KNOW THIS YEAR'S GET AGAIN TO DO THIS AND THAT ALL SUBJECT TO YOU KNOW TO CHANGE WITH THIS IS OUR BEST OUR BEST EFFORT THAT WE THAT WE HAVE. DID TWO YEARS AGO AND SB ONE SIX EIGHT. I THINK FROM CONCEPT WEVE GOT THE BENEFIT OF HAVING TO YEARS OF THE SUCCESS OF THE REACH OF REUSABLE BOTTLES IN OREGON THEY EXPANSION OF THE DROP CENTERS AND SAYING OKAY AND THEN. WE SAW IS THE WIDTH OF NICKEL TO DINE. BLOOM 6035% INCREASE IN THE IN THE USE PEOPLE OF PEOPLE ARE USING IT SO PRICE DOES MATTER SO THAT WE'VE TRIED TO BE YOU KNOW. AS MUCH AS HANDS OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH PEOPLE MADE SURE ALL HIS AND LET THESE PEOPLE RUN THE PROGRAM OKAY SO. THE ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS. WE TRY TO SOLVE THE- RECYCLING PROBLEM OR THE- FOR THE FOR THE PLASTICS PROBLEM THE SINGLE USE PLASTICS FROM OR DO YOU THINK THE BILL CAN SOLVE POST ALL OF ALL DO YOU EXPLAIN THE SINGLE USE PLASTIC SIDE OF IT BECAUSE I WE KNOW IT THAT'S IT THIS IS JUST A BOTTLED DOESN'T NOT TO SING A LOOSE IS PRACTICE SIX I'M SORRY I MISSED RIGHT WE CHOSE TRY TAKE THE BROKEN BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM WHICH- EVERYBODY AGREES. TO PULL OPPOSE A GREASE IS THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND SAYING HERE'S A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GONNA GO THAT'S THAT'S ACHIEVABLE IN CALIFORNIA DINNER SO NOT OVER PROMISE PRINTED IN IN STERN OVER PROMISING WHAT THE BCS SO IN THE COOPS DO WILL NOT REALLY ADDRESS. JUST THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NON RECYCLABLE MATERIAL AND READ THE MATERIAL YOU WON'T REALLY. NOT GOING TO GO TO THIS. VENDING MACHINE IN THE FUTURE AND THROW IN THE PLASTIC WATER BOTTLE UNLESS THERE'S A- UNLESS THERE'S A MARKET FOR IT WELL WELL WELL REMEMBER THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SET THE BECAUSE EVERYBODY CHAU EVERY DISTRIBUTOR SETS THE PRICE SO LET'S JUST SAY YOU HAVE. ECO FRIENDLY CAN COMPANY THAT MAKES RANKS AND THEY SAY WE'RE AND WE'RE GOING TO PAY WHATEVER THE FEE IS AND WILL MAKE UP A WE PARTICIPATE WERE ALL IN. YOU GOT NON ECO FRIENDLY YOU KNOW BOTTLE WITH TEN AND CLASSIC IN THEIR PACKAGING IS ALL. THAT PRIVATE INDUSTRY IS ABLE TO SET THE PRICE ON WHAT IT IS IF YOU WANT TO BRING THAT PRODUCT IN THE CALIFORNIA. IT'S GONNA COST YEAH YOU CAN BRING IN MORE DETAIL BUT YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GONNA COME UP THESE EXOTIC PACKAGING IDEAS YOU'RE GONNA PAY AND THAT'S PRIVATE INDUSTRY ANOTHER PRIVATE INDUSTRIES. THAT ASSESSMENT STILL GOES TO AT DISTRIBUTOR RIGHT. RIGHT YEAH A PLASTIC DISTRIBUTOR A MIXED MATERIAL DISTRIBUTOR AND THEY AND THEY EXTENDED TO THE MANUFACTURER BECAUSE THE BECAUSE IN CALIFORNIA COULD GO THE MANUFACTURES GETS ITS- FACTORED ALL OF THE WORLD BUT IF SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BRING IN. A PRODUCT IT'S GOT ONE OF THESE GOOFY SOME MARKETING PERSON ON STEROIDS COME UP WITH THEM THE MIX PACKAGE AND ALL THIS STUFF THAT THEY THINK IS. COOL. OKAY BUT YOU GET. IN CALIFORNIA AND THE HOPE IS AT THAT THEY SEE THE LIGHT AND SAYING MAYBE WE'LL JUST GO WITH A CLEAR BOTTLE MAYBE WE'LL GO WITH SOMETHING THAT THAT. THAT FIFTEEN THAT THE EXIT OF THESE EXOTIC PACKAGING TYPES WE'RE GONNA GO WITH SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S- THAT'S RE USABLE A FITS INTO THE SPIRIT OF SB FIFTY FOUR. AND IT'S NOT THAT SINGLE USE PLASTIC IT'S NOT THAT WAY IT'S NOT A DIRECT. IT IS. ARTICULATED CONCERN BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT PRICE THAT'S A GREAT. GOOD THING THIS REPORTS SHOW THAT WHEN THAT'S NOT DENNIS DENNIS WANTS TO ALSO ADD ON TIME. YEAH BUT. THIS IS WHAT I GOTTA GO THIS IS NO. WAY I WILL LET MISTER LOW FOR WHAT WENT USED. RIVERS I'M SORRY WAS HERE EARLIER IS IN ANOTHER HEARING- I WANTED ANSWERS IF I COULD ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF US FIRST OF ALL. ORGAN STARTED FROM THE START THE NEW YEAR REPRESENTING OUR CALIFORNIA BEER BEVERAGE SENATORS. AND ORGAN STARTED FROM THE START THE DISTRIBUTOR STARTED SHORT WERE NOW. WITH SOME TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY YEARS INTO THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO REBUILD IT AND RECAST AGAIN BY SAYING WILL YOU DISTRIBUTORSHIP. THIS FRANKLY WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE RUN OF THE FINANCING AND WE DON'T HAVE THE CONTROL OVER WITH WHAT. THE MANUFACTURER FOR BEER DISTRIBUTORS WHAT HOW THEY SELECT THEIR THEIR PACKAGING. OF YOU KNOW WE DON'T. WE DON'T DISTRIBUTE FOR THE MOST PART OTHER OTHER PRODUCTS OTHER THAN THAN BEER. AND BEVERAGES AND SOME NEW AGE BEVERAGES BUT BUT ALL OF THOSE THREE THEIR CANDOR BOTTLED. WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER IT FOR A FOR LEX TO HAVE ONE SIZE BOTTLE OR- WHATEVER THEY DO. I THINK THAT THAT TO SAY THE WITH THAT. OF A- POPULATION OF FORTY MILLION CAN CAN MOVE TO OREGON DID. WHICH IS A MIX OF OUR POPULATION LESS MILLION IN AND IN. TEN MONTHS IS NOT REALISTIC OR POSSIBLE AND THE BUILDER EVEN IF IT TAKES EFFECT NEXT YEAR IT'S AN OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT THERE'S- FIRST FALL ANY REAL REASONABLE WAY TO EXPECT EVER TO HAVE THE DISTRIBUTORS BECOME. DISORGANIZATION AND SPEND. YOU KNOW SENATOR WHITE HOUSE HIS DREAM FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS TO DO THIS SO I'M AND WE FRANKLY. DISAGREE AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO DO IT AND WE DON'T CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PACKAGING THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED. PLUS ARM OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE EXISTING LAW. THAT WE HAVE. PACKAGING THAT IS COMING FROM OTHER STATES THAT THE MONEY WAS NEVER RECEIVED HERE AND THAT'S AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. N FORCE A LAW YOU'D YOU'D HAVE A LOT BETTER PACKAGING THERE OR CONTROLLED IN WHAT WE DO NOW BUT BUT FRANKLY IT'S IT. IS NOT ENFORCEABLE. OKAY THAT'S YOUR FOR MISTER QUINN AND I JUST WAS IN A DOLLAR FOR THE SENATE RIGHT HILL AND SENATOR STERN IS GONNA GET AYE I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT. WE FEEL THAT THE CENTRAL CONCEPT OF THIS BILL. IS RIGHT THAT BEVERAGE COMPANIES HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBLE. THE PRODUCTS WE THINK COMPANIES YOU MEAN DISTRIBUTORS THIS PRODUCERS. THE PRODUCERS YEAH I MEAN YOU KNOW PEOPLE CAN REALLY DIFFERENT A- WELL IN THE BILL IF YOU USE A RAP OR PRODUCT TO SELL A PRODUCT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR BASICALLY MAKING SURE IT'S RECYCLED. AND THE POINT IS THAT IF WE GO WITH THE CONCEPT THAT MAKES THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFITING. FROM THE SALE OF- THE PRODUCTS IN THOSE IN THOSE IN THOSE BEVERAGES. BE RESPONSIBLE WE CAN GET A REDEMPTION RATE THAT'S 98% BECAUSE THEY DID IN GERMANY OR 89% BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING IT IN AN ARGUMENT MICHIGAN AND- ALL THE DETAILS THAT ARE GOING THAT WE TALK ABOUT NOW I REALLY JUST WANT TO REEMPHASIZE AS CONSUMER WATCHDOG IS A CONSUMER GROUP WERE ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE THEIR MONEY. BUT A LOT OF THESE DETAILS I DO THINK HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT AS WE GO FORWARD IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE PROGRAM AND I KNOW THERE'S THE YOU HAVE YOUR DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATION A BUT WHAT I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THE SENATOR STERN. IS THIS IS REALLY ABOUT GETTING MONEY BACK TO THE CONSUMER AND THERE IS A SINGLE USE PLASTIC BILL THAT HOPEFULLY WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THIS BUT THERE'S OTHER REFORMS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN WITH THIS BILL IS A MUCH AND MAYBE MORE CONSUMER BILL AS IT IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL BILL. SO CRAFT. A SEND UP. THEY RESEARCHED. SO THE NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY NOT NEW TO THIS ISSUE I WANT TO PER SE TO ALTER THIS BILL WHO HAS BEEN DILIGENT IN FACT MY DAUGHTER GOT A WHOLE EDUCATION THE OTHER NIGHT WHEN MY OFFICE ABOUT RECYCLING AND HOW ORGAN IS I ACTUALLY FROM WHAT CASKEY NO YEAH OKAY SHE SHE ASKED HIM SOME GOOD QUESTIONS LIKE HOW MANY JOBS ARE GONNA SUPPLY IN HER DOWN. AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T WILL GO OVER WELL. MAYBE ONE. ANYWAY MY I REALLY HAVE MORE OF A COMMENT THAN I DO THAT YEAH THE END OF THE DAY- WE HAVE A PROBLEM CALIFORNIA NO DOUBT ABOUT RECYCLING IN THE MOUNT RECYCLING AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH I MEAN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHEN THERE WAS A 50% WE PUT ON OUR LANDFILL WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. ALL RIGHT. AND WHAT WE HAVE IS WE'VE HAD UPS AND DOWNS WE'VE HAD MARKETS THAT HAVE. A LOT OF THESE FOLKS THAT ARE IN THE RECYCLING BUSINESS MADE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE THERE WAS A PLACE TO TAKE THIS PRODUCT AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT A PLACE TO TAKE THE PRODUCT. IT'S A PROBLEM OF WHERE TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY FIRST OF ALL. THIS BILL IS NOT A WORKING MODEL. THAT'S A GREAT PRESENTATION WAS OFF FOR. THIRTY FIVE MINUTES. BUT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING HEY SO DO THIS NOW. TO THE DISTRIBUTOR BASICALLY YOU PACKAGE OF HOW THEY'RE GONNA THEY'RE GONNA FIGURE THIS OUT I WILL SAY WE HAVE A BROKEN CALORIE CYCLE SYSTEM WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES OUT THERE REGULATING AND- THEN THEY WERE MAKING THE MONEY OFF OF WHAT WASN'T. RECYCLED. AND THE CONSUMER PACE SO FOR ME MISTER CHAIRMAN ASK A QUESTION OF YOU. HAS THERE EVER BEEN. A TIME WHERE WE SAT DOWN WITH THE- DISTRIBUTORS THE RETAILERS. THE RECYCLERS AND HAD A CONVERSATION OF WHERE WE GO IN CALIFORNIA WITH THIS BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU. THEY ONE GUY HAS AN ISSUE THE- THE LITTLE MARKET THAT I HAVE IT IN MY LITTLE TOWN THAT I HAVE DOESN'T HAVE THE- WHEREVER THEY'RE NOT. THE SAFE WAY THEY'RE NOT COSTCO DATE THEY ARE AN INDEPENDENT OWNER OF THE STORE IT IS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO DO SOMETHING AND WE WENT THROUGH I GOT LOTS OF CALLS AND IN MY OFFICE WHEN THEY HAD NO PLACE TO TAKE THEIR PRODUCT AND THEN THEY WERE TOLD THEY YOU YOU'RE TAKING BACK HERE THERE'S CONTAMINATION ISSUES ALL KINDS PROP AS EVER BENNET A HEARING WHERE YOU SAT DOWN WITH ALL THOSE FOR THE DAY WELL AND SAID. HEY WE'RE GONNA DO A BILL. WE DID THIS. WITH HELP. AND YOU WILL NEED TO BE THE TABLE YOU KNOW THE DAY OF YOUR PART BE THE ONE TO LOSE MY SO. YEAH HAPPENED MY ANSWER THAT IS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE CONTEXT OF. THE CONVERSATION OVER SB. AB TEN EIGHTY. I WE'VE BEEN HAVING INTENSE CONVERSATIONS WITH A GLASS FOLKS TO DISTRIBUTORS THE GROCERS. CONSUMER GROUPS- CITIES. HI THE PRODUCERS MANUFACTURERS AND- HAVE A WORKING REALLY HARD TO GET A DEAL TOGETHER. AND WE'RE WE'RE COMING WE'RE VERY VERY CLOSE. I THINK PART OF MY- YOU KNOW I YEAH. I WAS REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WHATEVER COMES OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION THREE SEVENTY TWO AND I THINK THAT THE GOALS ARE ARE. IN CONGRESS WITH WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO A FIFTY FOUR IN TEN EIGHTY. BUT I WAS I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE'D BE COMPLEMENT. ANY ODD SO AS TO RESPECT ALL THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN AND ALL THAT STUFF HARD WORK THAT'S GONE INTO. TRYING TO CROSS SOMETHING IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR EVERYBODY. WHICH IS WHICH IS AT THE HEART OF A WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO A FIFTY FOUR. IN TEN EIGHTY MISSED CHAIR AND CENTER DOLLY GOVERNOR BROWN CONVENE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS. COMMITTEE WHEN I CHAIRED IF WE HADN'T OVERSEE. EVERYBODY TO TRY TO. PICK WHAT WITH WHAT WITH THE PROBLEMS RESULT OF THAT IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN IN WAS IT. ONE STATE WHICH BOOKS. I HAVE AN EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSE BILLION ST GOT. YOUR HEARING UP ABOUT THE PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT COLLECTING THIS THEY'RE NOT COLLECTING OR THROUGH WE'RE GETTING 50% THE PRICE AND ALL THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE WRONG WITH IT RIGHT NOW AND DOZENS AND DOZENS AND DOZENS OF BILLS. THAT ARE GETTING. GET INTRODUCED AND HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO PUT BANDAIDS ON% TO SAY GIVE THIS GUY MORE MONEY GIVE THIS GUY MORE MONEY GIVE HER MORE MONEY GIVE HER MONEY EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET MORE MONEY. FROM CAL RECYCLE THIS IS ELEGANTLY TAKING A STEP BACK AND SAYING THE BIG PICTURE YOU'RE RIGHT I'M NOT I'M I DON'T GET TO TELL ANYBODY ANY COOPERATIVE HOW TO GET AROUND THIS PROGRAM. I JUST OFFER WORKING PROGRAM SAYING THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CALIFORNIA PROGRAM THAT'S GOOD LOOK MAKING CALIFORNIA FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT'S GOING TO BE DEVELOPED. WHEN THIS BILL GOES LIVE IT'S TWENTY TWENTY FOUR JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH IT'S FOUR YEARS FROM NOW. YOU KNOW WHEN THEY WHEN BASED ON THE BILL INTACT AND I'M WILLING TO IF SOMEBODY SAYS OH MY GOD FOUR YEARS IS NOT ENOUGH. YOU FOLKS CALIFORNIA CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER THE REASON WE WERE TRYING TO DO THIS. ONE THIS RENDITION OF IT TO GIVE EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME EVERYBODY EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT THIS. MY GOOD FRIENDS WHO SAID WHAT ELSE HE'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE YEARS I'M STILL TALKING ABOUT IT. THE ANSWER POLITICALLY DO WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO COME TOGETHER. PUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS CONSERVATIVES AND LIBERALS IN STATE THIS IS THE BEST WAY THIS IS THE PATH WE LET PRIVATE INDUSTRY DO IT AND I AM OPEN I HAVE BEEN OPEN. YOU KNOW UP TO THE DEATH CONVERSATION BUT I'VE- WILL BE KEPT IT. SIMPLE AND LET THESE GUYS RUN THE PROGRAM WERE GALS. GUYS GALS. YEAH WELL I WAS. I'M NOT I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE'VE LOST OUT ALL OF THE. RECYCLING LOOPHOLES AND I AND TO. WE MEET IN IN. I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT I WASN'T PART OF ANY THOSE I WAS I'VE ALWAYS ON YOU Q. AND- IN THE OTHER HOUSE. MOST OF THE TIME I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATURE I HAVE BEEN A PART AYE. WHERE OF THE- ONE OFFICE AND THE- CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN FACED WITH. IN RECYCLING WHETHER IT'S- RECYCLING. YOU KNOW. SINGLE USE. ROOMING NEEDLES FREEWARE IVAN ON TOURS. WITH RICH GORDON WHEN WE HAD ALL THOSE ISSUES- SO I'M NOT. A I'M- EXCITED ABOUT HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO. WEIGH IN WITH. WITH ACTUALLY THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. SITTING DOWN SAYING. WE DID THAT. WITH THAT ONE BONTA DID SB IS IT IN OF AB SEVENTY TWO WAS THE WAS THE- IT WAS A BILL WHERE WE. TALK ABOUT HEALTHCARE WE BASS HE SAID THE DOCKS IN THE AND HELP TO BE WE'RE GOING TO BILL WE HAVE A BIPARTISAN BILL. WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT SAME COMMITMENT HERE THIS IS WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING TO FIX THIS PROCESS. BUT EVERYBODY HAS TO BE THE TABLE YOU CAN'T. BECAUSE TRUST ME THE DISTRIBUTOR. IS HEARING WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA GET IT NOW HE SAID I CAN'T DO THAT WELL IF YOU'RE- IF YOU HAS NOT BE SAY THERE'S WHAT WE WILL DO. AND BY THE WAY THE RETAILERS GONNA HAVE THIS AND EVERYBODY'S IT. EVERY DAY. AND THAT. COMES AYE GUYS ARE TO. HE'S OUT RIGHT NOW. AND THERE'S- AT THE END OF THE DAY. WHEN THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE THEY'RE ALL HAPPY. BUT WHEN THERE'S NO MONEY TO BE MADE EVERYBODY BOARD TO PUSH OFF ON SOME BILLS NATURAL ROUTE RIGHT NOW. I WOULD JUST SAY THE CAL RECYCLE IS ACTUALLY THE PLACE WE'RE ALL THAT WAY. ALL THAT HAPPENS ONE JUST SAY THE WAY. THE REASON CAL RECYCLE AGREE WITH YOU THAT COVER CYCLE IS IT. IS IT IN YOUR AUCTION IS MURATSUCHI AND THAT'S WHY OUR RETENTION RATES FALL AND HOPEFULLY. THEY CAN FIX SOME OF IT BUT THE FACT IS. ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. IN THAT PROCESS. GETTING WHAT THEY WANT CALVET. DESPITE ALL THE TIME PETER JIM SO. I THINK I WELCOME THIS TABLE TO TRY TO. LOOK BIG PICTURE WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE AROUND. I JUST I'M SORRY TO LEAVE TO GO VOTE. I AND MY CONCERN IS. IS SIMILAR TO DOLLIES AND IT'S RECOGNIZING THE WORK THAT WE JUST PUT IN FOR A WHOLE YEAR. RIGHT AND PUT A PACKAGE TOGETHER THAT ACTUALLY WOULD WORK FOR EVERYBODY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR SORT OF. BLUNTNESS AND JUST COMING BACK WITH IT RIGHT IT'S LIKE. BUT I. WE'RE PICKING AN ASSESSMENT METHOD HERE AND WE'RE SAYING THESE GUYS GOING TO BEAR THE THEIR LOOK DISTRIBUTOR STRAIGHT UP MEANWHILE THE FRAMEWORK WE GOT OUT THERE IS SAYING MAYBE IS A MIX OF WAYS TO ASSESS THAT. AND I GET THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE BACK END MY CONCERN IS. ON THE FRONT END I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DARN CLOSE TO A DEAL ON A BROADER CIRCULAR ECONOMY FRAMEWORK AND WHILE THIS COULD BE ONE METHOD THAT THEY USED TO IMPLEMENT THAT. WERE PRE DECIDING THAT. SURE AND- I JUST. SUPPORT THE BILL AND I APPRECIATE YOU PUT A TON OF TIME TO THIS ISSUE BUT- I GUESS STUDY A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY. THE ACTUAL THE ASSESSMENT METHOD RECOGNIZING THAT SORT OF BOTH FRAMERS I GUESS ARE FLEXIBLE A BIT ON THE BACK AND RIGHT YOU'RE NOT PRESIDING CURBSIDE VERSES THAT THAT'S GOOD I LIKE THAT. BUT I BUT I AM. I'M JUST CURIOUS OF WHAT OTHER FRAMEWORKS ARE OUT THERE ANY CORPORATE TO ME P. R. PRINCIPLES BUT ARCHER TAILORED TO OUR- GEE I CAN'T TAKE. ON WE'LL BE ECONOMY AND SO. THAT'S THE HEART I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST I'M STILL STRUGGLE WITH THAT BUT I. I LIKE THAT YOU'RE WAITING IN WITH A WITH A- SORT OF JUST. ONE STRAIGHT. LIKE THIS IS THIS IS HOW YOU THINK IT SHOULD BE DONE AND- I THINK IT. BEARS WEIGHING IN THAT CONVERSATION BUT WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS AND WE'RE DARN CLOSE SO I REALLY WANT TO LAND SOMETHING SOON. SENATOR NIGHT. YOU ARE HERE FOR MY OPENING COMMENTS I'M A WATER FIFTH OF SB FIFTY FOUR I'M I WILL STOP THIS BILL IF SB FIFTY FOUR IN AB TEN EIGHTY FOUR INCLUDED.
