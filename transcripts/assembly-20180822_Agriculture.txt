THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE IT INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. SO -- TODAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS COMING IN AND OUT BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE OTHER COMMITTEES UP BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD THIS HEARING TODAY AND AND I KNOW THAT -- THERE AS EXCITED AS I AM IN A BIG THANK YOU -- TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY FOR BEING HERE. AS WELL. CALIFORNIA IS THE LEADING AGRICULTURAL STATE IN THE NATION. CALIFORNIA PRODUCED OVER FOUR HUNDRED COMMERCIAL CROPS WITH THE VALUE OF FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE NEED THE U. S. AND AG CROPS OF MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE DAY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE U. S. IN AG CROPS. AND IT AND WE ARE THE SOLE PRODUCER OF FOURTEEN CROPS INCLUDING ALMONDS RAISINS OLIVES DATES FIGS GARLIC HUEY THROUGHPUT PISTACHIO REASONS ONE IT'S TO GO I COULD GO ON AND ON IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THOSE AND YOU GOT TO BE HAPPY THAT CALIFORNIA GROSS THEM. THERE ARE MANY AND I THINK I LIKE THEM ALL THE I DON'T SEE ONE THAT I THAT I DON'T APPRECIATE. THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE INCLUDING HIGH PRODUCTION LAND THE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE. EXTENSIVE WATER TRANSFER AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM USE OF TECHNOLOGY A GREAT UNIVERSITY SYSTEM WITH GOOD AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND OUTREACH. A DIVERSITY OF FARMING TECHNIQUES AND A POSITIVE BRAND FOR CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL GOODS. THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES FACING OUR AGRICULTURAL SECTOR TODAY RANGING FROM REGULATIONS. ECONOMIC FACTS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE STATE WATER SUPPLY AND USE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS LABOR AND MANY OTHER ISSUES. CALIFORNIA HAS SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FARMS AND RANCHES WHICH IN TOTAL EQUALS TWENTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES THAT'S REALLY THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY. 90% OF THESE ARE FAMILY FARMS WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY THIRTY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE ACRES -- ALL OF WHICH HAVE THIS INCREDIBLE CONNECTION TO THE LAND AND EMBRACE GOOD STEWARDSHIP. TODAY'S HEARING IS TO DISCUSS THE WAY IN WHICH CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE BENEFITS THE ENVIRONMENT. AND TO UNDERSTAND IN X. EXPLORE WAYS THAT AGRICULTURE CAN BE AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN CALIFORNIA IN REACHING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS. OUR PANEL WILL BE DISCUSSING AG LAND CONSERVATION AND SOIL HEALTH. CROP SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND CURRENT RESEARCH WORKING TO EXPAND ON CURRENT AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. SO -- I'D LIKE -- TO AGAIN THANK -- AGUIAR-CURRY AND SEE IF HE'S GOT A FEW WHERE SHE WANTS TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT AND THEN WE'LL GET STARTED. WELL AS EVERYBODY THINKS THAT -- AGRICULTURE LISTS ARE NOT REALLY IN TUNE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. JUST LOVING TO SAY. YES WE DO WE DO CARE AYE FARM EIGHTY ACRES OF MY BROTHERS AND SO WE TRY TO DO IT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE CARE OF OUR LAND TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE WATER IN SUSTAINABILITY SO I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR SOME NEW IDEAS THANKS FOR COMING TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO COME UP AND SPEAK. SERENA UNGER SENIOR POLICY AND PLANNING MANAGER FOR AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST. AND BRIAN SHOW BE ASSOCIATE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA CLIMATE IN AGRICULTURE NETWORK WELCOME. SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBERS FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY -- AGAIN MY NAME IS SERENA ANGER AND I'M WITH AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST -- I HAVE A BACKGROUND IN LAND USE PLANNING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SO I BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE TO MY WORK -- ON FARMLAND CONSERVATION -- CAN FIGURE THIS THING OUT A OKAY. THAT HAS TO BE IN POWER POINT MODE AT VICTOR. WELL JUST START LIKE I WANTED TO JUST START -- WITH A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT IS LEAD ME NEED A YOUNGER PERSON TO OPERATE THIS. THANK YOU YOU -- WANTED TO START AT THE CONTEXT OF THE NATIONAL LEVEL AMERICAN FARMLAND TRUST -- NATIONAL TEAM JUST RELEASED A STUDY THIS SPRING CALLED STATE OF AMERICA'S FARMLAND FARMS UNDER THREAT -- THIS IS WHAT THE PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT LOOK LIKE ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER TWENTY YEARS OF THE DARKER. MAROON COLORS ARE BACK HIGH LEVELS OF CONVERSION FROM -- FARMLAND TO OTHER USES. I THE STUDY SHOWED THAT OVERALL DEVELOPMENT DISPROPORTIONATELY OCCURRED ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS MORE THAN 70% OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND 62% OF ALL DEVELOPMENT TOOK PLACE ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS. WE HAVE DEVELOPED NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH LAND AS WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY DEVELOPING UP LAND WITH GREATER PRODUCTIVITY. VERSATILE VERSATA -- VERSATILITY AND RESILIENCE SIX WERE LOSING THE BEST STUFF -- IF WE ACT HEAD OF ZOOM INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS VERY LINE YOU GUYS PROBABLY ALL KNOW THESE NUMBERS BUT THIS IS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION REMOVED REMOVING LAND FROM FARMING USES AT A RATE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES ANNUALLY -- OF THAT LAND CONVERTED 49% WAS FARMLAND PRIME FARMLAND IN THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. FOR EVERY FIVE ACRES LEAVING OUT. THAT THE AVERAGE DENSITY OF THE STATE'S URBAN AREAS IS LESS THAN TEN PEOPLE FOR EVERY ACRE DEVELOPED THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE NOT USING OUR SPACE EFFICIENTLY. IN CALIFORNIA OR IN THE COUNTRY F. THE CURRENT TRENDS CONTINUE ON THIS PATH WERE LIKELY TO LOSE ANOTHER ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND. AGRICULTURAL LAND BY. TWENTY FIFTY I BET I JUST WANT TO ZOOM IN AGAIN SETTING THE CONTEXT FOR THE LATER PART OF THIS PRESENTATION -- ZOOM INTO THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY -- OUR CALIFORNIA TEAM JUST RELEASED A REPORT LAST SPRING THAT LOOKS AT THE INTERSECTION OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND WATER RESOURCES IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. OUR GOALS WERE TO IDENTIFY THE MOST -- WE KNOW THAT WHILE EVERY ACRE OF LAND TO PROTECT PRODUCTION POSSESSES THE ATTRIBUTES NECESSARY TO SUPPORT AGRICULTURE. SOME LAND IS OF HIGHER QUALITY AND SOME LAND HAS MORE RELIABLE WATER SOURCES. KNOWING THE COMBINATION OF THOSE ATTRIBUTES WE CAN DO BETTER PLANNING FOR PROTECTING FARMLAND IN THE VALLEY. SOME KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE REPORT. LESS THAN ONE OUT OF TEN ACRES OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IN THE VALLEY IS OF HIGH QUALITY AND LOW WATER STRESS. BUT THE BIG FINDING. IN CONTRAST FOUR IN TEN ACRES ARE OF LOW QUALITY OR EXPERIENCING HIGH WATER STRESS. ONE OUT OF SIX ACRES OF WHAT IS ARGUABLY THE BEST MOST RESILIENT LAND IN THE VALLEY IS AT RISK OF BEING DEVELOPED. BEGIN IN TERMS OF THE WATER QUALITY IS THE SECOND NUMBER THAT YOU GAVE. SO -- FOUR IN TEN ACRES. ARE OF LOW QUALITY OR EXPERIENCING HIGH WATER STRESS. AND I CAN SHARE THAT REPORT WITH YOU GUYS -- SO WHAT IF WE'RE ABLE TO AVOID CONVERSION OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS WHETHER THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT THESE LANDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE. WE KNOW IT'S ABOUT SAVING OUR AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY WE KNOW IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE NATION'S FOOD SECURITY WE NEED FOOD -- OR BECOMING INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE POTENTIAL FOR AGRICULTURAL LANDS TO SEQUESTER CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN THEY'RE MANAGED PROPERLY. WERE ALSO INCREASINGLY BECOMING AWARE OF THE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE POTENTIAL THAT AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND ESPECIALLY THOSE INNER CITIES. PROVIDES TO HELP WITH THE STATE'S WATER. WE ALSO NOW HAVE A LOT OF DATA THAT SUPPORTS AGRICULTURAL PRESERVATION AS A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION STRATEGIES I WILL BE FOCUSING ON THAT YELLOW BUBBLE -- BUT IF WE CAN'T STABILIZE HURTLING TO PROTECT IT FROM BEING LOST WE CAN ACHIEVE ANY OF THESE THINGS. THIS QUOTE IN ALL RITA IS FROM AUTHORS OF ONE OF THE MOST COMPLETE REVIEWS OF LITERATURE ON REDUCING AGRICULTURAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THEY LOOKED AT ABOUT TWENTY STUDIES OF EVERYTHING FROM NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT. TO COVER CROPPING ANDCOMPOSTING AND HERE WAS THEIR ULTIMATE CONCLUSION. BECAUSE THE AVERAGE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM URBAN LAND USES ARE ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN THOSE FROM CALIFORNIA CROPLANDS. FARMLAND PRESERVATION MORE THAN ANY OTHER MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WILL LIKELY HAVE THE SINGLE GREATEST IMPACT IN STABILIZING AND REDUCING FUTURE EMISSIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE LAND USE CATEGORY. SEE THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT. IS THAT THAT [inaudible] THAT. HAS NO PLACE WEEK THERE'S NO WHERE WE WERE DOING THIS. AND IN IT AS A GHG REDUCTION STRATEGY. THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY THAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM THIS COMMITTEE YEAH IT'S IT REALLY WHEN WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS. WE HAVE AND THEY'RE UP THERE ARE HINTS OF THIS IN THE SCOPING PLAN THE CALIFORNIA BUT THEIR HITS. SO WE NEED TO START IMPLEMENTING THAT HITS -- INCE'S THE OPERATIVE WORD THERE HAVE RIGHT -- SO AND HERE'S WHAT THE MAGNITUDE LOOKS LIKE -- A COUPLE OF OTHER STUDIES SHOW WITH THAT MAGNITUDE IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. CROP PRODUCTION AND URBAN THAT LAND USES AND THEIR RELATIVES GHG EMISSIONS SO YOU YOU MAY KNOW OF THE WORK DONE BY PROFESSOR LOUISE JACKSON AND HER COLLEAGUES AT UC DAVIS. THEY WERE THE FIRST TO ESTABLISH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN URBANIZATION OF FARMLAND AND THE INCREASE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THEIR WORK FOUND THAT IN YOLO COUNTY GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS -- FROM URBAN USES ROUGHLY SEVENTY TIMES GREATER ON A PER ACRE BASIS THAN THOSE FROM AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. BUT WE TOOK THAT AND WE DID A SECOND STUDY WE WANTED TO LOOK AT CROPS ACROSS CALIFORNIA DIFFERENT TYPES OF CROPS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF CITIES -- SO WE REACHED SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS LOOKING AT THE STATE'S LEADING CROPS WHICH ARE HERE IN THIS GRAPH -- IN THIRTEEN CITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THIS STUDY FOUND THAT THIS FINDING HOLDS TRUE ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S TOP. HER TUMULT MULTIPLY URBAN I TYPES. I'M ON AVERAGE OUR CALCULATIONS SHOW THAT THE ANNUAL PER ACRE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE PRODUCTION OF CALIFORNIANS LEADING CROPS. AVERAGE FIFTY TONS PER ACRE LOWER FIFTY TONS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUIVALENT I'M LOWER THAN THE EMISSIONS FROM URBAN AREAS AROUND THE STATE. THIS TRANSLATES INTO A FIFTY EIGHT TIMES HIGHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM URBAN AREAS THEN FROM IRRIGATED CROPLAND. AGAINST IT'S THE SAME MAGNITUDE SO WE'RE SAYING FIFTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TIMES GREATER BASED ON THOSE TWO STUDIES -- NOW WHERE I LIKE TO HONE IN IS ON LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION DENSITY AND CITY DENSITY -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THAT RESEARCH -- AT IN ALL OF IT THAT SHOWS THAT THE CONVERSION OF CROPLAND TECH URBAN USES IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY. MEAN THAT THE CONVERSION TO URBAN USES INCREASES GREENHOUSE GAS AMOUNTS BY THOSE AMOUNTS -- THE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND AYE GLAND IS A STATIC NUMBER BASED ON THE EMISSIONS. OF URBAN AREAS IN CROP AREAS AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME OF THE STUDIES WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO AND WE WILL ADD. POPULATION AND ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE THOSE THINGS GO -- BECAUSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM URBAN LAND USES ARE KNOWN TO VARY WITH THE DENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT. FUTURE CONCENTRATION OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WILL INFLUENCE WHAT PERCENT OF EMISSIONS WILL ACTUALLY BE AVOIDED SO IT'S ALL ABOUT WHERE AND HOW DENSE. LOW DENSITY DEVELOPMENT PRODUCES MORE GREENHOUSE GASES PER CAPITA THAN HIGH EFFICIENT. DENSITY DEVELOPMENT. SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE FOR A MINUTE AF T. SHOWS THAT WITH FUTURE COMPACT DEVELOPMENT -- THERE WOULD BE A 55% NET SAVINGS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL AND URBAN EMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF CONCENTRATING. OUR POPULATION ON FEWER ACRES OF LAND. IF WE WANT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS LOS STILL ALLOWING THE STATE TO EXPAND ITS ECONOMY AND AT THE SAME TIME SAVE OUR FARMLAND FROM BEING CONVERTED TO DEVELOPMENT WE MUST DEVELOP AT HIGHER DENSITIES -- AND IF THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY LOCAL COMMUNITIES COMMIT TO BETTER PATTERNS OF DEVELOPMENT. I'M OUR RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT -- WILL BE PUT OUT A GOAL AT IF. THE ANNUAL LOSS OF FARMLAND TO DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA RESERVE REDUCED BY 50% BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND 75% BY TWENTY FIFTY THAT WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING TWO MILLION CARS OFF THE ROAD EVERY YEAR. REDUCING VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED VICE SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN BILLION MILES EVERY YEAR. AND SAVING ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF FARMLAND. THESE ARE ESTIMATES BASED ON OUR RESEARCH SHOWING THE MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE OF GHG EMISSIONS BETWEEN URBAN AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS. IF WE FOLLOW THE STATE'S TRAJECTORY. TO TWENTY THIRTY UP WE COULD MEET. GEE IT TO MEET ITS YET SHE REDUCTION GOALS THIS AMOUNT WOULD. EQUAL 18% OF THE STATE'S OVERALL GHG REDUCTION GOALS THAT'S THAT'S NOT NOTHING. AND SO IN REGARDS TO THAT IF IF I CAN ASK A REAL QUICK QUESTION WHAT ASSUMPTIONS DID YOU MAKE IN REGARDS TO THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE IN THAT. URBAN AREA IT BECAUSE PART OF THE CHALLENGE [inaudible] IS THAT. WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ACT CONVERSION? YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT LOS ANGELES OAKLAND OR SAN FRANCISCO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES. AND WHEN YOU ASK THEM IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN INCREASING DENSITIES -- REDUCING. PARKING SPACES AND INCREASING THE INTENSITY OF DEVELOPMENT. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THAT BECAUSE THERE ISN'T THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. THERE IS IN THE TRANSPORTATION MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE SO I'M I'M WONDERING IF YOU MADE ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THAT I DON'T DESERVE IT THE WAY THAT WE GOT TO THAT 55% -- WITH USING THEIR SAID SOFTWARE THAT HEALTH WORK ANALYTICS PRODUCE BECAUSE URBAN FOOTPRINT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD OF THAT. AND SO THEY DO -- KIND OF REGIONAL URBAN PLANNING SCENARIO DEVELOPMENT USING G. EACH G. IN A LOT OF OTHER -- AT METRICS. I DON'T NO WHAT'S EMBEDDED IN THERE BUT THAT'S OUR AUTHORISATIONS BEATS AMERICA. AND THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT. I'M STILL OUR CALL TO ACTION IS TO SET STATEWIDE GOALS FOR FARMING CONSERVATION THAT. THIRTY AT 50% BY 303075% BY TWENTY FIFTY OUT OF THE WAY I SEE IT IS THE SAME WAY THAT WE HAVE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT THE ARENA. WHERE THE STATE MANDATES A CERTAIN NUMBER OF HOUSING UNITS IN EVERY REGION MUST BE PLANNED FOR HIM BELT WE SHOULD DO THE SAME FOR FARMING CONSERVATION -- WE SHOULD REFORM PLANNING LAWS SO THAT COMMUNITIES CAN BETTER -- REDUCE THEIR PER CAPITAL AND CONSUMPTION FOR DEVELOPMENT -- WHICH DEFINITELY INCLUDES MORE TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS I'M. WE SHOULD I ADOPT STATEWIDE -- MITIGATION POLICIES SO THAT WE CAN BALANCE -- BUT IS LOST IN FARMLAND -- WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE CONSERVATION OF THE HIGH QUALITY LAND GETTING BACK TO OUR SAN JOAQUIN STUDY. AND WE SHOULD INCREASE FUNDING TO HELP SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT -- PRODUCED ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL GOOD AFTERNOON AT CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS BRIAN SHOW BY THE ASSOCIATE POLICY DIRECTOR WITH CAL CANNED THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE AND AGRICULTURE NETWORK -- AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURE IT'S SOMETHING OUR COALITION. I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN. I LIKE YOU AND PROBABLY EVERYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM -- OUR COALITION OF FARMERS RANCHERS RESEARCHERS AND TECHNICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. A BELIEVES THAT WITH THE RIGHT POLICIES INCENTIVES AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN PLACE. CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS CAN I DO ALL OF THE ABOVE SUSTAIN GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY PROTECT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. PROVIDE FOR ECONOMICALLY VIBRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES AND MAINTAIN OUR OUR WORLD CLASS I GLANCE IF YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT. I MEAN AND THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCERS -- IN OUR NETWORK OF PROVEN ALL OF THIS IS POSSIBLE. I'M SAID HIM AND TO TELL YOU ABOUT HOW CALIFORNIA IS SCALING UP THEIR INNOVATION. I AM BUT BEFORE I DO I FEEL I HAVE TO ADDRESS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THE GREATEST THREAT TO AGRICULTURE AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE LONG TERM. SO AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE DEALING WITH IT RIGHT NOW -- IN JUST THE PAST EIGHT YEARS WE'VE EXPERIENCED THE WORST DROUGHT SOME ST A MILLENNIUM. THE SECOND WETTEST WINTER ON RECORD AND OF COURSE A NUMBER OF THE STATE'S LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. AND WE KEEP OUR BREAKING THE RECORDS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BREAK [inaudible] RIGHT -- AND OF COURSE MANY FACTORS CAN EXPLAIN ANY SINGLE EVENTS OR NATURAL DISASTER BUT IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS DIALING UP THE FREQUENCY AND AND THE INTENSITY OF ALL OF THESE. SO THESE HAVE -- FAIRLY PROFOUND DE CONSEQUENCES FOR AGRICULTURE AS AN INDUSTRY DEPENDENT ON THE WEATHER -- REFLECTING THIS THIS NEW REALITY -- A YOU SEE PAPER PUBLISHED THIS SPRING BY SIX A UC RESEARCHERS PROJECTED THAT -- IF CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUES UNABATED BY TWENTY FIFTY YIELDS ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY 40% FOR AVOCADOS. AND 20% FOR ALMONDS TABLE GRAPES ORANGES AND WALNUTS WHICH AS YOU NOTED TEAR AND SOME OF THE BIGGEST CROPS IN THE STATE. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY THAT THE PICTURE IS EVEN BLEAKER THE RESEARCHERS PROJECT A 50% INCREASE IN SEVERE DROUGHTS AND SEVERE FLOODS. AND A POTENTIAL SIXTY FIVE LOS AT PERCENT LOSS IN OUR SNOWPACK -- ALSO THERE BUT THAT'S ONLY A PARTIAL LIST -- SO THIS IS THAT THE SLOW MOVING CRISIS FACING OUR INDUSTRY AND AND PARTICULARLY FACING -- MY GENERATION OF FARMERS WHO HAFTED FOR PREPARE FOR THIS FEATURE. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU A GOOD STORY -- SO WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS IS A CRISIS WE HAVE ALL OF THE TOOLS TO SOLVE. AND AGRICULTURE IN PARTICULAR. ARE HAS A UNIQUE ROLE TO PLAY WE HAVE. WHAT WE CALL ABUNDANT SOLUTIONS I'VE ASKED TO LOOK AT OF PRACTICES? THAT WE'VE COLLECTIVELY DEEMED CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE. THAT BOTH ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND ALSO IMPROVE THE RESILIENCE OF OUR FARMS AND RANCHES AND TO ITS IMMEDIATE IMPACTS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW. AND MOST OF THESE PRACTICES ALSO HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL COULD BENEFITS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT. SO CALIFORNIA'S ACCELERATING THIS TRANSITION THE CLIMATE SMART I CAN FOUR WAYS. BUILDING HEALTHY SOILS SAVING WATER AND ENERGY. PRODUCING LIVESTOCK METHANE EMISSIONS AND CONSERVING AT RISK FARMLAND. I DON'T KNOW OTHERS ARE GOING TO ARE GOING TO COVER MOST OF THESE TOPICS AND IN MORE DETAIL. I'M SO I'M GONNA FOCUS MOSTLY ON HEALTHY SOILS ABOUT IT WILL TOUCH JUST BRIEFLY ON THE OTHERS SO. WIRE WE BUILDING HEALTHY SOILS AND WHAT IS THAT WHAT IS THAT EVEN MEAN [inaudible] WELL [inaudible] BY ADDING. A SMALL LAYER OF COMPOST AND MULCH PLANTING COVER CROPS. AND REDUCING TILLAGE YOU'RE INSTALLING VEGETATIVE BUFFERS ON THE EDGES OF FIELDS. ANYONE OF TWENTY PLUS PRACTICE IS THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG AS HAS RECOGNIZED AS A HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICE. AND WE CAN IMPROVE THE THE FUNCTION -- AND THE HEALTH OF THE BIOLOGY IN THE STRUCTURE IN THE SOIL. AND IN TURN. THAT TURNS ARE -- OUR SOIL'S INTO SPONGES. THE USDA ESTIMATES THAT FOR EVERYONE PERCENT INCREASE AND SOIL ORGANIC MATTER. SO CAN ABSORB AND RETAIN AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GALLONS OF WATER PER ACRE. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT HAS. AT POSITIVELY. IMPACTS ON DROUGHT RESILIENCE GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. AB REDUCED FLOOD RISK AND AND REDUCE SOIL EROSION. HEALTHY CELLS ALSO INCREASE A NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY TO THE PLANTS IN THERE FOR INCREASED THEIR HEALTH AND YIELDS. AND THEY DO ALL OF THIS THROUGH -- PRETTY MAGICAL PROCESS CALLED PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHERE THEY TAKE CARMEN OUT OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND PUT IT IN THE FORM OF PLANT MATTER AND MICROBIAL AND THAT LIVING ORGANISMS. BENEATH HER FEET WHERE IT'S USEFUL AND PRODUCTIVE. I HAVE THIS PICTURE HERE IS OF SANDY MCGINNIS GARCIA SHE'S A FARMER IN WATSONVILLE AND ONE OF THE HUNDRED AND TWELVE FARMERS HAVE RECEIVED HEALTHY SOILS GRANTS. AND SHE SAYS THAT. WE CAN REDUCE OUR CARBON EMISSIONS AND FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS AND SAVE WATER AT THE TIME IT'S A WIN WIN WIN FOR FARMERS -- THEY'RE GONNA BE A NUMBER OF OTHER PICTURES OF A FARMER'S ON MY IT NEXT SLIDES I'M I DON'T HAVE TIME. TO TO QUOTE ALL OF THEM ASSURE ALL OF THEIR STORIES BUT I WANT TO KNOW THAT AND WE HAVE THE STORIES OF SANDY AND THIRTY OTHER -- FARMERS WHO RECEIVED CLIENTS MIGHT AYE GRANTS ON OUR WEBSITES AND SCRUBBING THEIR PROJECTS THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND AND THEIR QUOTES. AND CENTER TRUCKS TO CHECK THAT OUT. SO WHAT IS THE STATUS OF HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICE ADOPTION IN THE STATE -- WE RECENTLY COMPILED DATA -- ON THIS QUESTION TO HELP INFORM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD* OWN WORKINGMAN'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THIS IS THE PLAN WHICH WILL SET A TARGET -- FOR WHAT AGRICULTURE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATE'S OVERALL CLIMATE STRATEGY BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND SO ALL THIS HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF A THE STATS THAT WE WE FOUND -- APPROXIMATELY 6% OF ALMOND ACREAGE IN THE STATE IS ALREADY USING COVER CROPS. ABOUT 10% OF THE FARMS IN THE STATE USE CONSERVATION TILLAGE. OUR A WHOPPING 95% OF VINEYARDS -- ALREADY IS COVER CROPS REPLY COMPOST. AT JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND CROPLAND ACRES ARE CERTIFIED ORGANIC WHICH MEANS AND THEY'RE USING MULTIPLE HEALTHY CELLS PRACTICES. AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE ORGANIC RANGE LAND. AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WERE UNDER NRCS EQUAL CONTRACT TO IMPLEMENT SO HEALTH PRACTICES. SO WHEN WE HAD ALL OF THAT UP WE COME UP WITH A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE -- THAT APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ARE CURRENTLY USING HEALTHY SO AS PRACTICES. SO WHAT IS THE STATE DOING TO WRAP THAT UP. I WELL IT'S PRIMARILY INVESTING AT YOU ALL I HAVE INVESTED IN. A THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S HEALTHY CELLS PROGRAM. OUR THIS PROGRAM DIRECTLY INCENTIVIZE FARMERS TO A TRYOUT AND ADOPT THESE NEW PRACTICES. IT GIVES AN A THREE YEAR WINDOW TO TO FIGURE IT OUT MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL -- AND SO FAR THERE'S A THAT MONEY IS GONE TWO HUNDRED TWELVE PROJECTS AND THIRTY FIVE COUNTIES. AND I DON'T ESPECIALLY NO -- TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE ARE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. WHICH ARE UNIQUE HAVE BECAUSE THEY THEY CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR FARMERS TO LEARN THE WAY. FARMERS RANCHERS LEARN BEST AND THEY REQUIRE THAT HUNDRED TWENTY FARMERS OVER THREE YEARS VISIT THE SITE. AND LEARN FROM WHAT THE FARMER AND HOST IS DOING. BLOCKING THAT FENCE LINES KICKING THE DIRT -- TALKING SHOP ABOUT PRACTICES AND SO I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- COMPONENT AND INNOVATION FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND OF COURSE THIS IS ALREADY HAVING IMPACTS -- YOU CAN SEE THAT YOUR ACTIONS -- THOSE ARE ANNUAL SO THOSE WILL CONTINUE -- TO TO ACCUMULATE OVER TIME -- SO WE ALSO WANTED TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT KIND OF IMPACT COULD THIS PROGRAM HAVE BY. TWENTY THIRTY AND SO WE LOOKED AT TWO SCENARIOS A LOW AND HIGH -- AND BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF OF THE FIRST ROUND OF THE PROGRAM. AYE WE ESTIMATE THAT IF IF THE STATE INVESTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THIS PROGRAM -- WE'D ACHIEVE AN ADDITIONAL THREE NINE THIRTY THOUSAND TWO MILLION ACRES. UNDER HEALTHY CELLS -- MANAGEMENT BY -- TWENTY THIRTY AND THE RANGE THEIR REFLECTS OR OR DEPENDS ON EXTENT WHICH FARMERS APPLY FOR AND MULTIPLE PRACTICES OR JUST WANTED TIME. I AM YOU COULD SEE THAT IN THE FIFTY MILLION A SCENARIO I WOULD BE INCREASING THE ACREAGE BY A SIX AND SIXTY TO TWO MILLION ACRES -- BUT ALL NOTE AGAIN THAT WHEN CONSIDERING THE IMPACTS OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND THE GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH -- POINTING TO THE VALUE OF THESE PROGRAMS OF THESE PRACTICES AND WE DO THINK THE ADOPTION RATE WILL ACCELERATE AND AND GROW MUCH BEYOND THAT. I AM SEMINAR BREEZE THROUGH A ACTION ON THESE OF WHAT'S THE BIGGEST COST TO THESE PROGRAMS IS IT THE MATERIAL. VISIT THE APPLICATION IS IT THE INFORMATION I MEAN WHAT WHAT WHAT. WHAT IS THE MONEY GOING TO DO I GUESS SYSTEM [inaudible] YEAH -- SO. MATERIALS AND THE LABOR OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. I WENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND THEIR THEY GET SOME PORTION FUNDING TO DO OUTREACH AND EDUCATE -- SANDERS GOING TO BREEZE THROUGH THESE OTHER THREE BECAUSE OTHER FOLKS I THINK WE'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THESE -- OF COURSE CALIFORNIA IS WISELY ACCELERATING -- INVESTMENTS TO SAY WATER AND ENERGY ON FARMS. THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM OR SWEEP -- HAS INVESTED IN SIX HUNDRED FOURTEEN PROJECTS ACROSS THIRTY THREE COUNTIES -- IT'S EXTREMELY EXTREMELY POPULAR -- APPLICATIONS FOR FARMERS OUTNUMBER AWARDS BY NEARLY THREE TO ONE RATIO -- AND IT'S ALREADY HAVING A SIGNIFICANT AND WATER SAVINGS. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO IMAGINE SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND ACRE FEET YOUR HEAD IT'S ROUGHLY EQUIVALENT TO THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND OLYMPICS WHEN SWIMMING POOLS. THAT'S NOT EASY TO IMAGINE EITHER BUT I SO WERE ALSO A REDUCING LIVESTOCK METHANE EMISSIONS -- I THINK SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT I JUST YEARS I'M I'M JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT THE ALTERNATE MANURE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BECAUSE AND THE PROJECTS IT FUNDS ARE THE ONES THAT WORK FOR AND THE PRIMARILY SMALL AND MID SKILLED AREAS IN OUR NETWORK -- SO. IT JUST IN ITS FIRST ROUND LAST YEAR THIRTY FOUR MILLION WAS REQUESTED AT TWENTY FOUR MILLION WAS AWARDED TO SEVENTEEN PROJECTS -- AND BECAUSE NOTHING IS -- THIRTY TO EIGHTY TIMES MORE POTENT CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS -- FROM FROM THE SERVER ARE PRETTY IMMENSE -- THE OTHER BENEFITS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE THAT -- WHEN YOU WHEN YOU CONVERT A MANURE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FROM A WET SYSTEM TO DRY SYSTEM? AND YOU'RE SEPARATING SOLIDS AND IN MOST CASES THERE COMPOSTING THEM IN APPLYING THEM BACK TO THE LAND -- SO THAT'S INCREASING NUTRIENTS AVAILABILITY FOR FORAGE AND FEED CROPS -- IT ALSO PAYS FOR PRACTICES TO GET -- LIVESTOCK AND A COMPOST PACKED BARNES AND WHICH THERE'S RESEARCH SHOWING IMPROVES LIVESTOCK HEALTH -- AND ALSO OUT IN THE PASTURE -- AND BY SWITCHING TO A DRY SYSTEM ALSO REDUCING WATER USE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT [inaudible] SO. AND THEN LASTLY WE JUST HEARD ALL OF THE REASONS WE SHOULD BE CONSERVING AT RISK FARMLANDS -- I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THE SUSTAINABLE AG LANDS CONSERVATION PROGRAM OR SELL -- HAS CONSERVE FARM AND OTHER REMARKABLY FAST CLIP COMPARED TO PREVIOUS CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. I JUST THREE YEARS IT'S PERMANENTLY PROTECTED EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRES AND FIFTY TWO EASEMENTS [inaudible] AND THIS ALSO PAYS FOR TOUCHING ON THE LAND USE PLANNING PIECE THAT'S THAT ESRI MENTIONED -- IT ALSO PAYS FOR A STRATEGY AND PLANNING GRANTS FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN POLICY IDEAS AND ORDINANCES -- THAT WILL. ADD DRIVE DEVELOPMENT AWAY FROM OUR PRIME PRIME FARMLAND -- SO. TO WRAP UP -- THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE ALL FEEL IT EVEN IF EVEN IF SOME FARMERS DON'T. SAY CALLED BY THAT NAME EVERY FARMER HAS A STORY OF HOW THEY FACE SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE -- INNER IN RECENT HISTORY -- AND SO THAT THE THREAT IS IS SERIOUS AND IT'S NOW. AMEND WE'VE A LOT TO LOSE IF WE DON'T HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY. AND YET WE ALSO HAVE SO MUCH TO GAIN IF WE ARE TO FULLY INVEST AND IMPLEMENT. THESE KIND OF SMART AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR HON EVER ON TALK ABOUT TODAY -- AND SO I IN THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION WITH A NEW GOVERNOR -- AND WHAT LOOKS LIKE INCREASING CAP AND TRADE REVENUE WE THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RE PRIORITIZE THESE MULTI BENEFIT. AGRICULTURAL SOLUTIONS AND AND IN THEIR LEGISLATIVE A EXPENDITURE PLAN -- SO WITH THAT I'LL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND COSMIC QUESTIONS. GREAT CONCLUSION THAT'S REALLY THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMITTEE IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT CAN WE BE DOING BETTER. AND AS WE FOCUS ON THAT. UTILIZING OUR PRECIOUS FARMLAND TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS LET ME SEE IF. SOME OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS MISS AGUIAR-CURRY SURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION I AM HER PERCENT BEHIND THIS I WORKED AGAINST FUNDING FOR YOU LAST YEAR. HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BUT I THINK PEOPLE JUST NOT AWARE OF THE BENEFITS OF THESE PROJECTS THESE ARE REALLY ON THE GROUND AND THEY WORK PROJECTS -- LIKE YOU SAID IN A SWEEP THERE'S MANY PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT AND WE CAN'T ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE AND I WISH WE COULD -- BUT I'M ALT CONTINUE TO BE A CHAMPION TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROJECTS WORKS. I GOT MANY PHONE CALLS AMERICAN FARMLAND THESE THAT OF PEOPLE GIVE ME A CALL AND I THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE MOST COMPELLING ONES OF THAT I HAD AS I OWNING A RANCH IN THE MY FATHER FARMED FOR YEARS AND HE DID IT. HIS WAY. AND NOW THE FAMILIES ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY SOILS AND HOW DO WE ACTUALLY PUT A COVER CROP IN THE WALLET ORCHARD OR HOW WE GONNA REPLACE ALL PART OF THE WALL WITH THE ORCHARD HOW DO WE MAKE THE SOIL. SO IT'S BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS FOR THE OF THE PLANT SO ANYWAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PRESENTATION -- RIGHT ON KEEP WORKING HARD ON THIS BECAUSE WE GET THERE WE GET EVERYBODY EDUCATED ON HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS THANK YOU. VERY GOOD ANYONE ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SO THE ONLY THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE IN TERMS OF THE GOALS FOR THE FARMLAND TRUST IS -- AT THE WHOLE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS -- IN. THAT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM DOESN'T. INCENTIVIZE BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RURAL OR SUBURBAN AREAS. AND I THINK IT'S IT'S THE MISSING PIECE IS THAT IS. IF WAY DON'T DO IT RIGHT THAN PEOPLE JUST MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER OUT. AND THEN THEN WE DON'T WE LOSE THE BENEFIT OF THE CREEK GREENHOUSE GAS CLOSE CLOSE AND SO -- IT IT'S GOING TO BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT THAT ANY URBANIZATION INCLUDE ANY CONNECTION. WE START ADDING THE CONNECTIONS -- FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SO THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE -- THAT THE DENSER BUILDING. WITH THE REDUCTION IN PARKING. AND AND WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT OF THEIR VEHICLES SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES ARE JUST WHAT WE NEED TO MAKE THAT SHIFT IN. HOW WE DO IT IS WITH GOOD PLANNING I GUESS THAT'S THAT THAT'S MY BIG POINT AND I KEEP SAYING? I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET. FROM HERE TO SALINAS IN THE TRAIN BUT IT TAKES ME TWICE AS LONG AND PART OF IT IS IN A BUS. AND SO IT BECOMES REALLY INCONVENIENT AND MOST PEOPLE WOULD RATHER TAKE THEIR OWN VEHICLE AND SO -- UNLESS WE START TYING OUR TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS WITH OUR YOU KNOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES ON I THINK WE'RE GONNA MISS THAT OPPORTUNITY WILL CONTINUE TO SPRAWL LIKE THIS IS MY POINT TOTALLY AGREE. THANK YOU. IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I WANT TO THINK THIS PAN PANEL REALLY SET THE GROUNDWORK -- FOR YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. I WOULD LIKE NOW AT LIKE TO ASK THE SECOND PANEL TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. JOHN CHANDLER FROM CHANDLER FARMS. ALL BUT MANAGER OF ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA RIGHTS COMMISSION. MIKE LINES DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR THE AUDUBON CALIFORNIA. AND MICHAEL BOOK ADORO REPRESENTING GARY CARES WELCOME [inaudible] TO CHANDLER -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE OUT FIRST LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING I THINK THAT IT'S A A GOOD TOPIC TO TALK ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL. IMPACTS ON AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE'S IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT -- I AM A FAMILY FARMER FROM I JUST SOUTH OF FRESNO SMALL TOWN CALLED SELMA. NOW MY FAMILY'S BEEN FARMING THE SAME GROUND FOR WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS ON NOW THE FOURTH GENERATION FARMING THE GROUND WITH MY FATHER AND MY BROTHER -- AMONG THE CROPS THAT WE FARM ARE OUR LARGEST IS ALMONDS I WE GROW CITRUS WE HAVE SOME RAISIN GRAPES -- SOME PEACHES PLUMS AT AND A LITTLE BIT OF WINE GRAPES AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF HARVESTING OUR PEACHES RAISINS AND ARE ALMONDS SO IT'S A VERY BUSY TIME OF YEAR. WE'LL THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE BECAUSE IT'S IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOUR HAIR BUT I I UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH WORK IT IS STIMPY RIGHT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON. WELL I IT IS IMPORTANT SUBJECTS I I FIGURED IS IMPORTANT TAKE TIME TO COME HERE -- YEAH AS AS WE FARM AND WE'VE BEEN FARMING THE SAME GROUND FOR SO LONG THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES AND HOW AGRICULTURE HAS. EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA NOT ALONE LET ALONE THAT TYPES OF CROPS THAT WE HAVE FARM ABOUT HOW WE ARE FARMING IT. AND A BIG PART OF THAT HIS LEAD TOWARDS SOME VAST IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE'S ROLE IN THE ENVIRONMENT -- WE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT EARLIER ABOUT -- THE EARLIER PANEL TALKED ABOUT WATER EFFICIENCY ON OUR FARM ALONE -- WE HAVE BIT STARTED -- IMPLEMENTING SOME -- PROCESSES TO INCREASE OUR WATER EFFICIENCY WHEN I WAS YOUNGER WE USED TO USE ALL FLOOD IRRIGATION --% ON OUR FARM AND THAT STARTED TO CHANGE WE STILL HAVE SOME FLOOD IRRIGATION BUT WE'RE BEGINNING TO MOVE AWAY FROM -- FLOOD IRRIGATION MORE PRECISION WATERING THROUGH MICROSPORUM COLORS AND DRIPPED. AND AL LOT OF THE CHANGES INCREASED MORE RECENTLY BECAUSE OF STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE STATE AS A NEW AND STRICTER RULES COME DOWN ON OUR WATER DURING THE DROUGHT -- A PROGRAMS LIKE YOU HEARD EARLIER WE PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN A SUCCESSFUL -- APPLICANT AND REWARDED -- A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT PROJECTS THROUGH THE SWEET PROGRAM AND THEY'VE HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON OUR FARM -- BOTH ON ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY INSTALLING A HELPING US TO INSTALL A SOLAR SYSTEM PLANT TO A POWER OUR ELECTRIC PUMPS. AND TO CONVERT OUR SOME OF OUR FLOOD IRRIGATION FIELDS TO MICROSPORUM CLAIRE'S AND DRIP SYSTEMS. AND WHEN UP FROM THOSE CHANGES WE HAVE SEEN -- SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. PART OF THAT PROGRAM ALSO I CAN SEE A LOT OF OUR NEIGHBORS -- THAT FARM NEAR US HAVE BEEN APPLYING FOR AND PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROGRAM AND FIELDS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FLOOD IRRIGATED ARE STARTING TO MOVE TOWARDS THESE MORE PRECISION WATERING. AND THAT ALONE RC AS WHERE YOU'RE GONNA SEE REAL SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON FARM WATER USE IS A THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN FARMERS AND THE STATE AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO FIND TO REACH THOSE GOALS AND THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE. CRITICAL TO THAT. ANOTHER PROGRAM NOT RELATED TO WATER THAT WE ALSO PARTICIPATE AND IN IS VERY POPULAR AND I THINK HAS HAD A DRAMATIC EFFECT FOR AGRICULTURE. IS THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM OPERATED THROUGH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AND THAT RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING THROUGH THE I BELIEVE IS THE FARMER -- PROGRAM THAT WAS RECENTLY BUDGETS. THAT PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN REPLACING SOME OF OUR OLDER TRACTORS TRACTORS THAT WE'VE USED ON OUR FARM -- SINCE BEFORE I WAS BORN -- BACK FROM SET SOME TRACTORS FROM DATING FROM THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES DIESEL TRACTORS -- THAT WE AS FARMERS WE LIKE TO KEEP EVERYTHING PATCHED TOGETHER AND GO AS WHERE WHERE WHERE VERY FRUGAL. THAT THE AND THEY WERE NOT REALLY AS LOW POLLUTING THERE ARE A LOT OF TEARS ZERO TWO YEAR ONE MOSTLY TEARS ZERO TRACTORS AND THROUGH THIS TRACTOR REPLACEMENT PROGRAM. IT HELPS US INCENTIVIZE TO UPGRADE OUR QUITMAN AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REPLACE AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR HAVE COMPLETELY REPLACED OUR ENTIRE TRACTOR FLEET. TO TIER THREE OR FOUR TRACTORS AND THAT IS JUST ON OUR FARM THAT PROGRAM IS SO SUCCESSFUL. THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT. TO GET THE A THE APPROVAL FOR REPLACING TRACTORS BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY APPLICATIONS THERE'S MORE APPLICATIONS NOT THE MONEY. THEN PEOPLE ABLE TO PROCESS THE APPLICATIONS SO WE'D HAVE WAITS OF UP TO TWO YEARS JUST BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A HIGH VOLUME OF AGRICULTURAL IS SEEKING TO CHANGE THEIR TRACTORS. AND SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMISSIONS AND ON ON FARM AND OFF FARMAN THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY. NOW GOING FROM TWO ZERO TO TIER THREE OR FOUR THAT YOU HAVE SUCH AN INTEREST WITHIN THE INDUSTRY TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. I THINK THAT SAYS A LOT ABOUT AGRICULTURE AND ITS INVESTMENT IN. PARTICIPATING IN PARTNERSHIPS TO TO CLEAN UP -- THE AR INTO AND MODERNIZE OUR FLEET OF EQUIPMENT -- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT WE'RE ALL KIND OF BASICALLY IN THIS -- VALLEY TOGETHER AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE TOGETHER WE WORK TOGETHER AND NOT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE ON HELPING TO INCENTIVIZE SHOWS THAT I THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF POWERFUL INFLUENCE ON ON THE ENVIRONMENT -- OTHER THAN THAT I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER SMALL ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPEN ON THE FARM BUT MY MY BIGGEST POINT IS IS I THINK FOR LOOKING AT AGRICULTURE AND ITS PARTICIPATION AND AND AND TRYING -- TO TO BE BETTER STEWARDS OF THE LAND THAT WE FARM FOR SO LONG -- AS AS THE WORLD. SENATE'S DEFINITELY HELP. AGRICULTURE MAKE THE CHANGE TO THE MODERN -- MODERN STANDARDS BECAUSE IF YOU'RE A LARGE FARM. IT'S EASY -- TO SPREAD THAT COST OUT OVER A LARGE ACRES BUT FOR YOUR MID SIZE AND SMALL FARMS LIKE MYSELF -- THE CHANGES ARE MUCH HARDER TO MAKE AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THESE PROGRAMS CAN HAVE EVEN BAKER -- INCENTIVE TO HELP [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY. HI MY NAME IS PAUL BUTLER WITH THE CALIFORNIA RICE COMMISSION -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND TALK ABOUT. THE RICE INDUSTRIES -- ENVIRONMENTAL RESUME -- JUST FOR A LITTLE BACKGROUND -- I SPENT OVER TEN YEARS WITH CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD AND I'VE BEEN MANAGING ENVIRONMENTAL AFFAIRS NOW TO RAISE COMMISSION FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS -- GOING TO THE NEXT SLIDE. HERE ARE JUST SOME SYMBOLS REALLY OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THEM FOR FOR DECADES OF COURSE BUT ON THE LEFT SIDE I'M AND SCENE OF THE MILLIONS OF WATERFOWL THAT COME UP FROM THE RICE FIELDS AND THE WINTER TIME -- WATERFOWL IN THE CENTER AND THEN UP ABOVE WE HAVE A SHORE BIRD THERE LONG BILLED CURLEW. IT IS HIGHLY IMPERILED INTO THE U. S. SHARPER CONSERVATION PLANNING IT THRIVES WELL IN CALIFORNIA RICE AND WE DIDN'T BEEN DOING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK WITH OUR WATERBIRD PARTNERS TO ENHANCE -- HABITAT FOR FOR THOSE BIRDS ENOUGH IN THE UPPER RIGHT YOU SEE THE GIANT GARTER SNAKE WHICH IS A THREATENED SPECIES WHICH THRIVED A WELL AND HAS ADAPTED WELL -- TO RICE INDUSTRY IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY IN FACT THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT IF RICE WASN'T THERE THAT SNAKE MAY NOT BE THE AROUND EITHER SO. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU SEE THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE CLEAR SKIES WHICH FORMERLY THEY WANT SO CLEAR WE BURNED ALL OF OUR RIGHTS STRONG. WHO NO LONGER DOING THAT AND -- USING ALTERNATIVES TO DECOMPOSE R. RICE STRAW. AND THEN OF COURSE WE SEE A SALMON WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A FEW MOMENTS IT'S SORT OF THE NEXT OF FRONTIER FOR US WE HOPE -- FOR IMPROVING HABITAT. US SO THAT 97% OF THE OF THE RICE IN IS GROWN RIGHT HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ABOUT FIVE BILLION. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND JOBS TO THE ECONOMY. OH WE GROW VIRTUALLY EVERY GRAIN OF AMERICA'S SUSHI RICE -- THE REST OF THE U. S. GROWS A PRIMARILY LONG GRAIN AND WE GROW ALL OF THE SUSHI RICE. A IN THE UNITED STATES AND OF COURSE I WE HAVE THE HIGHEST YIELDS IN THE WORLD -- WERE MUCH MORE ATER EFFICIENT THAN YOU MIGHT IMAGINE TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AS WELL. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE A A VERY -- STRONG THIRTY YEAR HISTORY OF MANAGING WATER AND AIR QUALITY PROGRAMS -- HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY -- RICE'S GROWN IN JUST FIVE INCHES OF WATER A MANY PEOPLE THINK IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT BUT IT IS INDEED JUST FIVE INCHES -- WE USE -- GPS TECHNOLOGY TO LASER LEVEL THOSE FIELDS US FLAT AS A TABLE TOP SO THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE WATER. VERY VERY PRECISELY AND EFFICIENTLY. USING ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF WATER HAS ORANGES AND BROCCOLI ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO EFFICIENCY IS A RICE IS GROWN IN VERY HEAVY CLAY SOILS. THAT DO NOT PERCOLATE A WATER MUCH AT ALL SO THEY'RE PERFECT SORT OF BATHTUBS. TO DOUBLE WATER VERY EFFICIENTLY -- BUT TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SPECIES ARE USING THESE RICE FIELDS -- IF YOU IF THE RICE FIELDS WERE NOT THERE A BUT YOU WANTED TO PROVIDE. THE SAME AMOUNT OF HABITAT TO SUPPORT THE SAME NUMBER OF WINTERING WATERFOWL ABOUT. SIX MILLION DOCS YOU WOULD HAVE TO ACQUIRE AND RESTORE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF OF WEAPONS. THAT WOULD COST YOU ABOUT THREE BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE THEN YOU'D HAVE TO MAINTAIN THOSE ACRES. AT SOME PROBABLY FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR SO THERE'S JUST ONE ONE SLICE OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT THAT IS WINTERING WATERFOWL THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THE MODELING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. WITH OUR PARTNERS. OF ALL OF OUR RACE FIELDS ALONG WITH THAT ROUGHLY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF WETLANDS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY ARE DESIGNATED AS SHOREBIRD HABITAT. OF INTERNATIONAL SIGNIFICANCE YOU CAN READ ABOUT THAT IT MANAGEMENT DOT ORG -- AND WE HAVE A VERY VERY STRONG -- PARTNERSHIPS WITH A ALL THAT. A LOT OF HOW CONSERVATION'S. CONSERVATION GROUPS HERE -- AND FACT IN YOUR PACKET THAT I'VE LEFT YOU THERE'S THAT THERE'S AN INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENT THAT SHOWS REALLY ALL THOSE PARTNERSHIPS IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE IMPLEMENT TOGETHER. JUST A REALLY INTERESTING GRAPHIC SHOWS YOU ABOUT 60% OF EVERYTHING A DUCK EATS COMES OUT OF RICE FIELDS ABOUT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF WHAT THEY NEED IS COMING FROM WETLANDS -- INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH HALF OF THAT WETLANDS PIE -- IS ALSO RELATED TO RIGHTS BECAUSE OF COURSE THE RICE FIELDS DON'T CONSUME ALL OF THE WATER IN THE FIELDS THAT'S DRAINED OFF AT THE END OF THE SEASON -- ABOUT SEPTEMBER ONE OR SO. AND ALL THAT WATER THAT STRAINED OFF IS USED BY OTHER DOWNSTREAM USES INCLUDING A HALF OF THE WETLANDS FLAT UP WITH OUR TAIL WATER -- BUT BECAUSE IT'S RIGHT ABOUT THE TIME THAT THEY NEED TO FLAT OUT FOR TAXIS AND SO -- THE ENERGETICS AYE. IS. GOV OUT A DOUBLE THE WATERFOWL THEIR IN THE VALLEY IN THE WINTER. ARE ARE VERY VERY RELIANT ON RICE ACRES THEY'VE ADAPTED TO THEM WHILE. 95% OF THE WETLANDS ARE GONE AND SO MORE IN A SITUATION WHERE THESE RICE FIELDS ARE NOW UP. YOU KNOW CARRYING LABORING MORE FOR WATERFOWL. AND JUST SEE. WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS HERE'S A COUPLE OF GRAPHICS -- IF 50% OF THE RICE FIELDS WERE TO GO AWAY THEIR AB ONE MILLION FEWER DUCKS. KNOW WHEN OUR TIME HERE IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND THAT'S SUPPORTED BY THESE ENERGETICS CURVES YOU SEE AT THE BOTTOM. THE BOTTOM YOU CAN SEE THE THE RED CURVE IS THE DUCK POPULATIONS IN THE BLACK CURVE IS FOOD WITHOUT RICE -- AT THE DOCKS EITHER STARVE OR HAVE TO LEAVE THE AREA ABOUT DECEMBER. BUT WITH RICE SEE THAT BUT I'M VERY HIGH BLACK CURVE. OF THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE GROWERS Y. THEY WOULD LOVE -- EVERY KERNEL OF RICE THEY LEAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS THREE HUNDRED POUNDS BEHIND. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE DOCTOR AFTER -- HIGH CARBOHYDRATES TO PREPARE TO GO UP AND HAVE VERY SUCCESSFUL A NESTING. SO WE HAVE A HAD A LOT OF SUCCESS -- WITH OUR PARTNERS OF ATTRACTING INCENTIVE DOLLARS -- FOR PROGRAMS -- IN YOUR PACKET IS THAT IS THAT IS REALLY A CASE STUDY ABOUT A PROGRAM THAT WE BUILT -- RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALLED AND THEY WATER BIRD HABITAT HANSON PROGRAM WE CALL IT WEAPONS -- WE EIGHT BASICALLY INVENTED -- FOUR FIVE UNIQUE PRACTICES THAT WE KNEW THAT WE COULD THAT INCREASE THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFIT OF EACH ACRE OF RICE WITH THESE PRACTICES. AND SINCE THEN AND RCS HAS CONTRIBUTED ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. TO ENHANCE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND ACRES OF RICE -- IN THAT TIME FRAME. HOWEVER WHERE WE'RE STRUGGLING TO HOLD ON TO THOSE PROGRAMS SO SO FEDERAL FUNDING IS IS DECLINING IN RECENT YEARS -- WE'VE NOT. EVER TO THIS POINT HAD AS A STATE PROGRAM REALLY THAT WAS DEDICATED FOR THIS TYPE. RICELAND HABITAT PURPOSES. I AM. VERY PLEASED TO REPORT THAT AP AT TWENTY THREE FORTY EIGHT MS CURRIE'S BILL. WILL DO EXACTLY THAT AND THERE'S A THERE'S A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME APPROPRIATION TO GET US STARTED ON THAT. AT THAT THAT GREAT STARDOM WILL BE ABLE TO DO I BELIEVE MANY OF THAT GREAT PRACTICES THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED A A USING THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS I SEE ABOUT. PUTTING MORE STATE FUNDS TO TO TO A PROGRAM LIKE THIS IS THAT ALLOWS US TO ATTRACT MORE FEDERAL FUNDING IS EVERY TIME YOU WANT. TO GO APPLY FOR ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS YOU NEED A NON FEDERAL MATCHING. ARE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. A ANOTHER WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT. IN THESE PRACTICES IS THE RICE INDUSTRY HAS CREATED THE CALIFORNIA ICELAND'S WATERBIRD FOUNDATION -- WET WEBSITE IS PROMINENTLY THERE FOR EVERYONE TO TO SEE -- IF YOU WANNA INVEST IN -- HABITAT IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY WE VERY EFFICIENTLY TAKE THOSE DOLLARS. WE WORK WITH OUR WATER BIRD PARTNERS AND A OUR GROWERS AND WE INCENTIVIZE THE GROWERS TO DO THE ACTIONS THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO IT EXACTLY THE TIME OF YEAR WE WANT THEM TO DO TO PROVIDE VERY SPECIFIC AND TARGETED HABITAT. AT A VERY COST EFFECTIVE RATE SO. ANYONE THAT TO ONCE A TAX DEDUCTIBLE DEDUCTION AND ALSO OUR OWN AN ACRE HABITAT THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY THAT'S A GREAT VEHICLE TO DO SO. SUBMIT YOUR ON THAT CAN YOU TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THOSE PRACTICES ARMY LIKE WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO OKAY AND ARE JUST TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF OKAY MIGHT TAKE A COUPLE MINUTES BUT OF ONE OF THE PRACTICES WE DO FOR EXAMPLE IS. A GROWER IS MOST EFFICIENT AGRA NAM AKELEY. IF AT THE END OF THE WINTER SEASON WHEN THAT MAYBE THEY'LL GET THE FIELDS FLOODED THEY TRAIN THEM OFF LIKE A FEBRUARY ONE ALL AT THE SAME TIME SO IT CAN DRY OUT THOSE FIELDS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REALLY GET PLANTED. MUSCLES FIELDS OF DRY. WE ARE PRACTICE IT ENCOURAGES THEM TO KEEP THAT WATER OUT THERE LIKE TILL MID MARCH -- AND DRAIN THOSE FIELDS -- BY 25% A WEEK SO NOW THERE'S A VARIETY OF SHOREBIRDS THAT COME IN AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS IN TERMS OF DEPTH OF WATER SO. I LIKE TO SAY A BIRD CAN COME ON TO ONE FIREMAN FIND HOT BROW OF DIFFERENT TO A DEPTH OF WATER. TO UTILIZE WILL ALSO HAVE A PRACTICE TO BRING WATER ON EARLIER -- IN THE FALL AFTER HARVEST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THIS BUT THE SHORE BIRD MIGRATION HAS ALREADY STARTED LIKE IN JULY LIKE IT'S WRAPPING UP NOW IN THESE BIRDS COMMAND. THEY HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING THAT OPEN SHALLOW WATER THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR AND SO -- AGAIN IT'S MOST. THAT ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT FOR AGO OUR DEBT -- HAVE HIS WHOLE TEAM WORK ON NOTHING BUT HARVEST FOR LIKE FIVE WEEKS. BUT IF THEY CAN SOMEHOW START WORKING ON GETTING WATER ON THE FIRST HALF OF THEIR FIELD WHILE THEY'RE STILL HARVESTING THE LAST PART WE CAN GET SOME WATER ON A EARLY AND IT'S VERY VALUABLE FOR THE SHORE BIRDS. IT'S ALSO NESTING ISLANDS IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PRACTICES THAT I COULD DO IT [inaudible] I'M. SO THIS IS WHAT WE HOPE TO BE THE NEW FRONTIER -- FOR US A WHEN YOU WHEN YOU REALLY THINK ABOUT THE CONCEPTS WE'VE DONE FOR BIRDS WE'VE WE'VE ESSENTIALLY REKLAME TO THE THE THE FLOOD PLAIN FOR BIRDS JUST AS THEY USED HISTORICALLY. EXCEPT NOW WE FLY THEM IN RICE FIELDS UNDER VERY CONTROLLED SITUATIONS AND THE BIRDS ARE USING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME LANDS THEY DID HISTORICALLY. WELL YOU KNOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH FISH. TOO OUR BECAUSE THE REASON WE HAVE A SALMON RUNS IN CALIFORNIA IS LARGELY BECAUSE THOSE SMALL SALMON FRY ORIGINALLY GREW UP IN THE FLOOD PLAINS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. WHERE THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FLOW VERY FEW PREDATORS ALLOTTED COVER AND THOSE THE FACT THAT THAT WATER JUST SITS THAT RECEIVES ALL THAT SOLAR ENERGY AND THE PHYTOPLANKTON SO PLANKTON CYCLE? IT FEEDS THE THOSE THOSE FISH. AND THEY GROW VERY. AGGRESSIVELY HISTORICALLY THEY WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE MAIN CHANNEL THE RIVER AFTER THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH. TO AND YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THOSE FLOWS AND EVADE PREDATORS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. NOW WE'VE ESSENTIALLY SEALED OFF THE RIVER FROM THE FLOOD PLAIN AND THE SMALL FISH HAVE TO SORT OF FIGHT FOR THEIR LIVES RIGHT IN THE MAIN CHANNEL THE RIVER. SO NOW WE ARE LOOKING AT SEEING IF WE CAN -- UTILIZE WINTER FLOODED RICE FIELDS EXACTLY THAT WAY ACTUALLY PUT THE SALMON IN THE RICE FIELDS. AND HAVE THEM GROW A VERY VERY QUICKLY THERE'S A PROJECT WE'VE DONE -- FOR THAT HAS BEEN DONE FARE FOR OVER FIVE YEARS CALLED AN EERIE PROJECT WHERE WE'VE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE GROWTH RATES. ARE EVER EXTREMELY HIGH I IN RICE FIELDS IN THE WINTER TIME SO WE'RE GONNA TRY TO REPLICATE THAT. WE ALSO MAY BE ABLE -- TO DOT EXPORT HIGHLY NUTRITIOUS WATER BACK INTO THE RIVER FROM THE RICE FIELDS WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT IN A MINUTE. HERE YOU SEE OUT SOME PICTURES OF WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT SO ON THE UPPER RIGHT ARE THE LITTLE MICROSCOPIC CRITTERS THAT THESE YOUNG SALMON NEED. AND THEY'RE VERY PLENTIFUL IN RICE FIELDS WINTER FLOODED RICE FIELD OF THE LOWER CORNER SHOWS YOU. A MANY MANY OF THOSE YOU KNOW PER DROP IN IN WINTER FLOODED RICE WATER. AND SO IF WE CAN. GET THE FISH TO THAT AND THEN HAVE THEM FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO THE RIVER THAT'S ONE CONCEPT OR WEAKENED. MORE -- PURPOSEFULLY EXPORT THAT WATER INTO THE RIVER AND FEED THEM IN THE RIVER. SO THERE'S TWO APPROACHES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT MAKING SOME PROGRESS ON WE ARE. RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF TRYING TO DEVELOP A PROJECT I DON'T HAVE IT YET BUT I DO HAVE COMMITMENT FROM AN RC*. FOR ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IF WE CAN PUT THE PROJECT TOGETHER. OUT WE WOULD ACTUALLY OUTPUT OF THE FISH IN THE RICE FIELD AND PUT LITTLE RADIO TAGS IN THEM AND TRACK THEM ALL THE WAY OUT THE GOLDEN GATE. WE WOULD DO THE SAME THING FOR THE FISH THAT HAVE TO STAY IN THE RIVER. AND WE BE ABLE TO MAKE IT DEMONSTRATION IF THE RICE FIELDS REARED FISH ACTUALLY SURVIVE AT HIGHER PERCENTAGE. A OUT THE GOLDEN GATE VERY EXCITING SCIENCE. WILL ALSO BE PUTTING A FEW THOUSAND FISH AND IN THE FIELDS PER ACRE AND HAVING THE GROWER MANAGED TO HABITAT TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS. TO SEE IF WE CAN DEVELOP A LONG TERM PRACTICE STANDARD. FOR THIS ACTIVITY THAT COULD BE FUNDED. FOR A FROM A PROGRAM LIKE EQUIPED NRCS WE HAVE ROW REYES SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN MATCHING DONOR FUNDS SO FAR. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MATCH AT LEAST. ONE TO ONE OF THE SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM AN RCA BECHTEL END UP BEING PROBABLY ABOUT A ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PROJECT SO THERE'S ROOM ON THE BANDWAGON FOR ANYBODY THAT WANTS. TO A JOINT IN. AND WERE CURRENTLY LIP SORT OF THE LAST PIECE WE'VE GOT ITS DURING TALKS WITH. A DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ABOUT THEIR CRITICAL ROLE OF PROVIDING US THESE FISH FROM THE HATCHERY -- SO AS SOON AS WE GET DOWN -- SOME UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHEN AND HOW THEY CAN PARTICIPATE AT THAT LEVEL ALLUVIAL TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS EXCITING PROJECT. THAT'S IT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND WE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHE DID WELL WILL FINISH THE PANEL AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK AND SEE WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT I THAT SALMON PROJECT IS VERY EXCITING. BECAUSE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT. THE COLLAPSE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN DROUGHT WE SEE THE COLLAPSE OF CERTAIN. SALMON RUNS AND SO THE ABILITY TO BRING IT BACK AND TO SET UP A NEW MODEL IS VERY EXCITING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER LANCE. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL LINES ON THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY FOR A LOT OF ON CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS THE STATE BRANCH FOR THE NATIONAL AUDUBON SOCIETY. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO COME SPEAK TODAY AND TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT WE SEE FROM AGRICULTURE. PARTICULARLY TO BIRDS BUT TO OBTAIN VOMIT LARGE GIVEN I THINK THE REALLY PRODUCTIVE AND POSITIVE COMMENTS ABOUT A VAN PROVIDED BY CAL CAN AND OTHERS PAUL CERTAINLY. THE OTHER PRETTY BURKE PICTURES I SHOULD STONE SOME OF THOSE MAKE IT WILL COME UP FOR US. PAT. I I DON'T REPEAT THOSE BUT I DO WANT TO SERVE -- EMPHASIZE OUR SUPPORT FOR THAT FOR THE NOTIONS OF A COW CAM IS TALKING ABOUT ABOUT CLIMB AS MUCH STRATEGIES ON FARMS HEALTH FARMS ALREADY ARE BETTER. AT HAD -- RETAINING -- CARBON AND OTHER GHG BENEFITS NOT ALSO I NON JONASSAINT BY MODERNIZING SOME OF MACHINERY THAT'S OUT THERE THAT'S I MEAN AUDUBON'S CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. AND I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO A COUPLE POINTS THAT HEARD ALREADY AND THESE ARE THINGS I'M GONNA TOUCH ON WHICH OUR THEY NEED ONE TO MIMIC WHAT WE CAN NATURAL PROCESSES AND THAT'S BOTH. A WETLAND AREAS AND AS WELL AS FOR ABOUT THE FISH I THINK IT'S AN EXCITING NEW OPPORTUNITIES. THEY'RE OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO PURSUE AND WE NEED TO INVEST IN. AND AND ALONG THE LINES OF INVESTING IS THIS NEED FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO INCENTIVIZE LAND OWNERS AND FARMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE PROGRAMS. A LOT OF THESE YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS IS JOHN IS INDICATING YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING ON A MARGINAL SCALE ABOUT HOW FARMS HOW PROFITABLE FARMS CAN BE IN THE MARKET DRIVEN. AND SO IF WE AS A COMMUNITY AS A STATE ONE INVEST IN THEM AND AND HELP DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE FUNDING SOURCES THAT'LL HELP DURHAM. LINED US UP AND THEN THE LAST PIECE REALLY IS TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND EDUCATION WHETHER THAT'S CONNECTING -- REGULATORS AND AGENCIES AND POSITIVELY IF OF LANDOWNERS OR NGOS PROVIDING A CONDUIT BETWEEN DIFFERENT LANDOWNERS WHO CAN SHARE PRACTICES INFORMATION. SO TO START IN THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF A REPEAT FROM WHAT -- PAUL WAS TALKING ABOUT WHY WOULD A CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION LIKE AUDUBON BE ENGAGED IN WORKING LANDS PROGRAM WE WOULD ACT WORKING. AND ACROSS THE NATION. WELL IN CALIFORNIA ALONE -- THERE'S AT LEAST SEVEN MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE. AND BUT THERE'S ONLY AN ESTIMATED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PART MANAGED WETLANDS LEFT. SO NATURALLY PRIOR TO NINETEEN HUNDRED THERE WERE PROBABLY FOUR MILLION ACRES OR SO OF NATURAL FLOOD PLAIN WETLANDS IN THE STATE THEIR IMMENSELY DIVERSE. EARLIER EXPLORERS RECORDED THAT THEY WOULD WITH A HELP WITH THEIR WILD FIRES WERE ACTUALLY BIRDS JUST COMING OFF THE WETLANDS IN SUCH NUMBERS THAT THEY BLOTTED OUT THE SUN. AND SO WE CERTAINLY HAVE MANY FEWER OF A WETLAND ACRES LEFT TODAY AND LIKEWISE ARE BIRD POPULATIONS HAVE DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL. PAUL MENTIONED THAT TIME -- WE HAVE -- FIVE TO SEVEN MILLION ACRES VIBES FIVE SEVEN MILLION WATERFOWL THAT USE THE STATE EVERY YEAR THAT'S A NUMBER THAT'S PROBABLY DOWN FROM THIRTY TO FORTY MILLION. HISTORICALLY LIKEWISE THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SHOREBIRD THREE AND FIFTY THOUSAND SHOREBIRDS -- PROBABLY WAS WELL OVER THREE MILLION AT ONE TIME HISTORICALLY SO FROM A CONSERVATION. ORGANIZATION WE UNDERSTAND THE BIRDS ARE DECLINE GRASSLAND BURNED AS WELL AS WELL TOUCH ON THAT WITH RANCHING. A AND THAT IN ORDER TO HAVE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIES NOT JUST BIRDS BUT ALL THE OTHER SPECIES AS WELL. THEN THAT REQUIRES COLLABORATION AND PARTNERSHIP WITH FARMERS AND LANDOWNERS AND OTHERS THAT ARE STEWARDING LARGETRACTS OF LAND IN THE STATE. ARE THE LAST THING I'LL ARE JUST WILL NOTICE THAT WE'VE ALSO IN RECENT YEARS BECOME MORE MORE AWARE OF THE NECESSITY. FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS AS PART OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGY NOT JUST IN SEQUESTERING CARBON BUT ALSO PROVIDING WILDLIFE CORRIDORS AND SOME DEGREE OF RESILIENCE FOR NATIVE PLANTS AND NATIVE WILDLIFE. AS THE LANDSCAPE OVERALL CHANGES AND I THINK THAT WILDLIFE CORRIDOR IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. AT LEAST THOUGHT OF ON AND THOSE OF US WORKING ON TRUST JAIL TAXES. SO WHAT OF ONE CREATED TO TWERKING LANCE PROGRAM WITH A VISION OF HELPING TO CREATE WITH IN CALIFORNIA. A MATRIX OF WORKING LANDS AND MANAGED WETLANDS PROVIDE FOR THIS LONG TERM SUSTAINABLE. CONSERVATION AND IS EXECUTED TWO ON THE GROUND STAFF WE HAVE -- SEVENTY THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND. OPERATE INCLUDING A ACT OF CATTLE RANCH OUTSIDE OF WINTERS AS WELL AS BIOLOGISTS AN ANALYST TO GO OUT TO WORK WITH PARTNERS LIKE PAUL AND THE LANDOWNERS. AND WHAT WE TRY TO DO ON OUR LAND AND OTHER IS DEVELOP PILOT PROJECTS THAT CAN BE SCALED UP FOR LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT PAUL PARTY MENTIONED. AND I WANNA MENTION AND EMPHASIZE WE DON'T DO THAT ALLOW NOT ONLY IS THE PARTNERS -- AMONG FARMERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES BUT ALSO WE'RE PART THE MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NATURE OF WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND POINT BLUE CONSERVATION SCIENCE. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN IMMENSE WORK DONE BY OTHER PARTNERS INCLUDING DUCKS UNLIMITED IN CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL. AND MANY OTHERS THAT ARE TRYING TO WORK ON THIS NOTION OF THE MATRIX OF MANAGED AND NATURAL LANDS. SO TODAY WE'VE HAD SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING THE DROUGHT WHEN HABITAT WAS SHRINKING ALL AROUND US WE STILL MANAGE TO WORK WITH PARTNERS TO SECURE A HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF IRRIGATED CROPLAND. THAT PROVIDED ACT OF HABITAT FOR WATERFOWL AND AND SHORE BIRDS THAT WERE REALLY STRESSED DURING THIS PROLONGED DROUGHT. AND WE DID THAT IN PART WITH AN INVESTMENT OF OF OVER FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDING THAT WENT TO THE LANDOWNERS IN ORDER TO HELP THEM MAKE THAT HAPPEN FOR THE KIND OF PRACTICES THE PAUL ALREADY MENTIONED. I WE'VE ALSO -- AND ENGAGE THOUSANDS OF LANDOWNERS TO SHARE RESOURCES AND CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER LAND OWNERSHIP DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER PRIOR TO WORKSHOPS AND OTHER TRAINING SESSIONS. IN ORDER TO ALLOW THEM TO TRADE INFORMATION ON WHAT WHAT IS WORK ON THEIR LANDS BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO KNOW BEST THAT THE ONES MANAGING THOSE LANDS. AND SHARE INFORMATION ON RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE THE KIND OF GRANTS AND FUNDING -- JOHN MENTIONED EARLIER. TWO OTHER SPECIFIC EXAMPLES I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE THAT ARE RECENT AND HAVE I THINK DEMONSTRATED HOW NGOS AND THE COMMUNITY COURT TOGETHER. A THE FIRST IS WITH THE ROBINS RICE COMPANY AND AUDUBON CREATED THE FIRST EVER AND BURKE FAMILY RICE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. AND NOW ROBIN'S RICE ACTUALLY HAS A LABEL THAT THEY PUT HOW FOR MARKETING ON THEIR RACE PRODUCTS. AND THEY DIDTHAT IN CONSULTATION WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE PROJECT OTHER PRODUCT ALL THE WAY FROM THE GROUND TO TO PROCESSING WAS AS BIRD FAMILY AS POSSIBLE. AND I THINK THAT THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO WORK IN THAT KIND OF PARTNERSHIP TOGETHER TO HELP BOOST THEIR SALES AND ALSO. CREATE A A PIPELINE OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THEIR IN THEIR PRODUCT. THE LAST ONE IS A LITTLE MORE CONTROVERSY ON NOW BUT RECENTLY THE TRI COLOR BLACK BIRD WAS LISTED AS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES IN THE STATE. AND AUDUBON WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THE FARM BUREAU AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND EVEN THOUGH WE DISAGREED AS TO WHETHER THAT SPECIES SHOULD BE LISTED AS ENDANGERED OR NOT. EVEN DURING I'D SAY MAYBE THE MOST CONTENTIOUS PARTS OF THAT DEBATE AROUND THE SPECIES THERE WAS STILL A VERY STRONG AND PRODUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AUDUBON. AND THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND THE FARM BUREAU AND THEY REALLY STEPPED UP TO GO OUT AND EDUCATE LANDOWNERS. AND TRY TO WORK ON IN OUR CS PROGRAM WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY USED AS WELL AS LEVERAGING PRIVATE. HOME FUNDING IN SOME OF OUT OF ONE'S OWN FUNDING. WHO ARE BURDENED BY HAVING THIS SHE'S ON THE LAND AND THEY WERE TRYING? TO HARVEST THEIR CROPS TO FEED THEIR COWS. AND SO I THINK THAT IS AN EXAMPLE ON THAT WE CONTINUE TO BE PROUD AT AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON NOT ONLY ON TRICOLOR BLACKBIRD BECAUSE THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE EVEN OF THE SPECIES IS STILL. LISTED BUT IN ORDER IN THE FUTURE TO TRY TO FIND FUNNY MONEY TO INCENTIVIZE HE'S KIND OF PROJECTS. THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE THAT WENT WHERE EVEN SOMETHING IS AS CONTENTIOUS IS AN ENDANGERED SPECIES THERE CAN STILL BE A LOT OF ROOM TO WORK NOT OF MINE AND MANY OTHER NGOS ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE BURDENS ON LANDOWNERS. BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IS TO INCENTIVIZE LANDOWNERS TO INVITE THIS SPECIES ON THEIR LAND AND MAINTAIN THEM SO WE CAN DO SAFE HARBOR PROJECT PROJECTS AND REGULATIONS. AND AND OR SOME OTHER SORT OF AVENUES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO LANDOWNERS ON LOOKING FORWARD I THINK WE'VE ALL TALKED ABOUT THE CLIMATE CHANGE THE IMMENSE CHALLENGES. FOR SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THERE'S AT LEAST A HUNDRED EIGHTY SPECIES THAT ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO AT LEAST TOWARD EXTINCTION. CLIMATE CHANGE OVER THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE CLIMATE CHANGES OR AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT FOR A LOT OF SPECIES. AND NOW WE SEE ADDITIONAL PRESSURES ON FARMLAND AND NATURAL LANCE'S WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED. OBVIOUSLY WATER SUPPLY CHALLENGES WILL. SINGLE GROUNDWATER BUT AGAIN AS DROUGHTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PROLONGED HOW WE GOING. TO PROVIDE THAT WATER TO DIFFERENT LAND USES AND ALSO PROVIDE FOR BY DIVERSITY. AND THEN POPULATION GROWTH AND AND IT'S KIND OF URBAN EXPANSION INTO NATURAL AND WORKING LANCE IS A HUGE CONCERN. IT'S JUST SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES WE SEEK TO WORK ON THOSE AND I'VE MENTION THESE BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAD A HIT ON THEM JUST FOR FOR I'VE STOPPED HERE WHICH IS. ONE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE FUNDING TO ASSIST FARMERS AND RANCHERS -- A TO KEEP DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND ALSO WHERE POSSIBLE TO IMPROVE PRACTICES EITHER FOR THE KIND OF GHQ BENEFITS MATT. MANAGE HOWEVER MENTIONED ALREADY OR INCREASING BURKE FAMILY PRACTICES -- WE WANT TO TRY TO FIND A BALANCED WATER SUPPLY MANAGER PROGRAM THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IF THAT DOESN'T AND THERE'S A LOT MORE CONTENTION. FIGHTING OVER THAT VERY OFTEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND BERGSON HABITAT A GOING TO LOSE FIRST. AND SO IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE THOSE THINGS WORK TOGETHER -- AND THE LAST PIECE I WANTED TO MENTION WAS REALLY ON FINING KELABIT SOLUTIONS AGAIN ON SPECIAL STATUS SPECIES -- WHEREVER POSSIBLE TO SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENTS IN THESE KIND OF FUNDING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BY NRCS [inaudible] LASTLY I BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ON IS A SCIENCE BASED ORGANIZATION WANTS TO EMPHASIZE THAT WITH ALL THESE MATCH PRACTICES ALSO BECOMES A NEED. TO INVEST IN SCIENCE. AND WHEN WE CAN DO MY MONEY TRAIN IN ADDITIONAL SCIENTIFIC INVESTMENTS WE CAN FIND WAYS TO MANAGE THE TIMING AND MANAGEMENT OF THINGS LIKE WATER LIKE PAUL MENTIONED ABOUT WHEN THAT SHOULD GO ON THE LANDSCAPE. TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS TO SPECIES WILL ALSO REDUCING THE BURN THE BURDENS ON THE LANDOWNERS. AND I THINK WHEN WE DO THAT WE ACTUALLY FIND WAYS TO REDUCE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS BETWEEN CONSERVATIONISTS AND THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. THANK YOU WRITTEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY HELPFUL. WHATEVER GO. FOR THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MICHAEL BOCA DORAN I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SERVING AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR GARY CARES AND HAVE FOR ABOUT THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. A ITS OUR INDUSTRY COALITION THAT INVOLVES THE ENTIRE DAIRY INDUSTRY THAT WORKS EXCLUSIVELY ON SUSTAINABILITY ISSUES SO. I'M REALLY GONNA FOCUS TODAY ON SOME OF THE METHANE REDUCTION EFFORTS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A TREMENDOUS STORY. AND THEN BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHER EXTENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS THAT THE INDUSTRY IS WORKING ON OUR DAIRY METHANE REDUCTION STRATEGY IS -- MEUM BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN IN THE LEGISLATURE THE LAST FEW YEARS -- BUT WE HAVE A A REALLY GOOD. PLACE AND IT'S BASED ON THREE PRIMARY APPROACHES AND THAT'S COOPERATING WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE CPUC. AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT THAT'S A VERY PRODUCTIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP. RIGHT NOW WITH THREE PRIMARY INITIATIVES RESEARCH. NOTHING AVOIDANCE AND METHANE CAPTURING HIM TO TALK ABOUT BOTH OF THOSE. AND THEN. THIS IS ALL MADE POSSIBLE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS WOULD NOT BE WORKING EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT. SENATOR LARA WINNIE CRAFTED THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE RECOGNIZE AND SENATE BATES PROGRAM WAS GOING TO BE NECESSARY HERE. AND THE GOVERNOR AND THIS LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED UP OVER THE PASSPORT BUDGET CYCLE SOME PROVIDED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO CDFA FOR DAIRY METHANE REDUCTION. SO IT'S A REAL STRAIGHT FORWARD APPROACH AND IT'S WORKING WELL -- SO JUST ON THE RESEARCH SIDE WHERE WE'RE DOING A LOT WORKING WITH CDFA INNER BE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND EMISSIONS TO YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND AND WE'VE NOT ONLY WORKED WITH THERE BEING CDFA WE'VE WORKED THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND ANOTHER PRIVATE ENTITIES. TO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THAT. AND A A REPORT WILL BE PUBLISHED SOON FROM EDF LOOKING AT THAT SOME OF THE AREAS WERE VERY EMISSIONS CURVE. WE'RE WORKING TO QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR IN THE FIELD NOW DOCTOR FRANK MET LONER FROM UC DAVIS TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE ALTERNATE MANURE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND QUANTIFY. THOSE BENEFITS WERE LOOKING FOR OTHER METHANE REDUCTION OPPORTUNITIES CONSTANTLY AND THEN WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING. TO MAKE SURE AND AND VALIDATE. WHAT IT IS WORK COMP PUSHING AND SO? IT'S A GREAT STORY THE AMP PROGRAM HAS NOW FUNDED EIGHTEEN PROJECTS. ARE THERE GOING TO BE FUNDING PROBABLY AT LEAST ANOTHER FORTY MORE HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS WE EXPECT THEM TO BE ANNOUNCED BY CDFA THIS MONTH -- SO I IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM ARTIST AT SOME OF THE HIGH POINTS MORE THAN -- SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TOTAL METRIC TONS OF CO TWO WE JUST FROM THOSE FIRST EIGHTEEN PROJECTS -- WE EXPECT. AND THAT THESE PROJECTS AND WILL HAVE AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF THEM OPERATING BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO VERY FAST RAMP UP. FROM EIGHTEEN IN THE INITIAL ROUND MAYBE AS MANY AS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND AT THAT. BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO WE OVER A TEN YEAR LIFE CYCLE. AS IT'S VERY TREMENDOUS AND THESE ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ON VERY SMALL DAIRIES TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CALS TO SOME VERY LARGE DAIRIES OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND IN A KIND OF RUN THE GAMUT OF CONVERTING FROM FLESH TO SCRAPE. SOME PASTOR BASED PROGRAMS AND THEN THE EXTENSIVE USE OF SOLID SEPARATION ON SOME OF THESE DAIRIES. THAT TO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF OF NOTHING THAT GOES. AMOUNT OF THE NEWER THAT GOES INTO A LOOK AND AMOUNT OF METHANE IT PRODUCES. THE DEBATE I JUST A PROGRAM IS A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS STORY AS WELL -- SIXTY FOUR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED TO DATE ACHIEVING ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS OF THIRTEEN MILLION METRIC TONS OF CO TWO E. OVER THIRTEEN YEARS. THE COST OF THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE JUST TWENTY SEVEN DOLLARS PORTAL ALL IN. AND THE COST OF THE STATE IS JUST. EIGHT DOLLARS A METRIC TON. SO IT IS THE THIRD MOST COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS GOVERNMENT IS MAKING WITH THE GT R. F. FUNDS. AND AS A OR B. REPORTED IN THEIR LAST REPORT IT'S THE NUMBER ONE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM IN ACHIEVING TOTAL GHG REDUCTIONS. AND IT'S ALL NOTHING WHICH MEANS WE'RE GONNA SEE THE BENEFITS OF IT MUCH SOONER THAN OTHER CO TWO REDUCTION PROGRAMS SO. SO THAT THAT. STATISTICS IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT NUMBER. AND THAT THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE HEARING QUITE FRANKLY IS THAT. AS WE DISCUSSED. CAP AND TRADE. AND SPENDING AND WHERE IT SHOULD GO AND HOW IT SHOULD BE ALLOCATED -- IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT WE LOST THE MORE LIBERAL. MEMBERS. OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS GOING TO GET THE MOST BANG FOR ITS BUCK OR TOO MUCH WAS GOING TO AGRICULTURE. BUT I I AM. THIS IS WHY THIS HEARING BECOMES REAL IMPORTANT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. HOW IMPORTANT AGRICULTURE IS TO OUR? REDUCTION GOALS AND HOW IF WE PARTNER. WE CAN TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AT A REALLY COST EFFECTIVE. ABOUT RATE SO I AFFECTING QUEUE OUR THAT YEAH AND WERE WERE ALL ABOUT THE STATISTICS BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SO. ARE OVERWHELMING IN TERMS OF WHAT IT'S ACHIEVING. I ENDED SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD BE DOUBLING DOWN ON THAT INVESTMENT NOT BACKING OFF AS WE GO WELL AND WAS AS I PUT IT PROBABLY SHOULD ADD AS A FOOTNOTE THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR BOTH ENDS OF OUR CAUCUSES. AND IN THE END SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS PAID A PRICE FOR BEING SUPPORTERS AS WELL SO THAT IT. IT BECAUSE IT HIT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND THERE WERE A LOT OF AYE SUPPORTING IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR OUR CAN BOTH ENDS OF OUR ARE ORGANIZATIONS. TO TO COME ONBOARD SO THIS STATE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. ISSUE IT IT'S TREMENDOUS AND JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WE HAD TWELVE PROJECTS AND BY TWENTY TWENTY TO GIVEN THE CURRENT LEVELS OF FUNDING THAT ARE FOR READY BEEN APPROPRIATED BY THIS LEGISLATURE. WE EXPECT TO HAVE AS MANY AS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PROJECTS ON PREDICTS A TENFOLD INCREASE. IN JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS AND MOST OF THESE NEW PROJECTS ARE OF THE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS VARIETY NOT THE ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION VARIETY. WHICH MEANS ARE ALSO GOING TO BE PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION FEEL. THAT WILL REPLACE DIESEL AND WE'LL SEE CRITERIA POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS. IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN THE SOUTH COAST AND OTHER DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE SO IT'S GOT THAT ADDED BENEFIT THAT WILL ALSO BE QUANTIFYING. THE MAP JUST SHOWS YOU THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS THE CITY EIGHTY PRODUCTS IN THE STATE THAT ARE. EITHER OPERATING ON VARIOUS STAGES OF PRODUCTION WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED THERE'S A HEAVY CONCENTRATION IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THINK MISTER SALAS IS LEFT BUT AT A BIG OF CLUSTER AYE IN KERN COUNTY AS WELL. IN TERMS OF SOME OF THESE EARLY PROJECTS. SO JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE METHANE REDUCTION EFFORTS -- CALIFORNIA RECENTLY BECAME THE NATION'S LEADER IN DERRY METHANE REDUCTION WE PASS THE OTHER STATES I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE LONG BEFORE WE PASSED THE Q. MOTIVE. OF ALL THE OTHER STATES. ARE TO BE GIVEN THAT THE PACE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS IT'S A CRITICAL PIECE OF THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS YOU'VE ALREADY STATED MADAM CHAIR. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED IN SHOWING THE ENTIRE WORLD HAD JERRY CAN BE PART OF A GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEM. AND WE ARE MOST IMPORTANTLY ON PATH TO ACHIEVE THE 40% REDUCTION -- THAT THE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS PROGRAM IS LOOKING FOR AND MANEUVER METHANE EMISSIONS AND DAMN HOPEFULLY. WHEN CARP DOES A REPORT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO I WILL BE IT'S A -- I'M AGAIN -- A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT REAL BRIEFLY SOME OF THE OTHER DAIRY SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING ACROSS THE STATE. ARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY IS A BIG AREA OF FOCUS FORCES WALL WERE WORKING WITH DRIP IRRIGATION ON TWENTY FARMS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. ON FOOD CROPS ALFALFA ANOTHER FEED CROPS AND IT'S SHOWING UP TO A 40% WATER SAVINGS. AND IN SOME CASES NOT JUST WATER SAVINGS BUT INCREASED YIELDS -- ENERGY USE EFFICIENCIES A BIG AREA THIS IS ONE OF THAT THE GOOD THINGS THAT P. JEANNIE DOES WHEN THEY'RE NOT BURNING DOWN -- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OTHER HELPING. THERE ACHIEVING UP 220% REDUCTIONS -- IN ENERGY USE EFFICIENCY -- AND THAT'S A COOPERATIVE PROGRAM THAT WE WORK WITH BOTH PGD IN EDISON ON OUR ELECTRIFYING A LOT OF EQUIPMENT A FEED MIXERS AND IRRIGATION PUMPS THAT'S ALSO PROVIDING SUBSTANTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. ON A RENEWABLE ENERGY STANDPOINT I THINK THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IS IS WAY OUT IN FRONT WITH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FARMS HAVING INSTALLED. A SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AND THAT NUMBER KEEPS GROWING IN A LOT OF THAT WAS MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE. HAD THE FORESIGHT TO ALLOW US TO AGGREGATE -- IN THE NET ENERGY METERING PROGRAM WHICH REALLY MADE THOSE PROJECTS. VIABLE FOR WATER QUALITY STANDPOINT R. DAIRIES OPERATE UNDER VERY STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS AND WILL BE MAKING FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY ARE DOING. TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AND WE'RE WORKING HARD ON THAT AS WE SPEAK. AND PRODUCTION SIDE BUT THE PROCESSING SIDE IS ALSO MAKING SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS. OTHERS A NEW PROGRAM THAT'S GAL GRANTS ARE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE AT THE END OF THIS MONTH THE FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM WHICH AGAIN WAS FUNDED BY THIS LEGISLATURE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLES. AND THAT ALLOW THE DAIRY PROCESSING PLANTS AND SHE'S MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS. ON THE PROCESSING SIDE AS WELL FROM SUSTAINABILITY STANDPOINT. SO ALL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING I'M -- AND WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO OUR FIRST EVER CALIFORNIA JERRY SUSTAINABILITY SUMMIT. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING LATER THIS YEAR WE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THEY WEBSITE WENT LIVE TODAY -- IT'LL BE HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND WERE -- NOW WORKING WITH THE ENTIRE DAIRY INDUSTRY ON THIS PROJECT. AND WE THINK IT'LL BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SHOWCASE SOME OF THE WONDERFUL THINGS THE DAIRY INDUSTRY DOING. I'M GLAD AUDUBON BROUGHT UP THE WORK WE'VE DONE ON TRI COLORED BLACKBIRD SO WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. VERY. GOOD PRESENTATION QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. I KNEW -- I'VE TAKEN A GREAT INTEREST IN THIS DIET DAIRY DIE JUST OR THE LAGOONS. PARA METHANE REDUCTION -- THINKS I'M INTRIGUED BY YOUR PRESENTATION AND I'M INTRIGUED ABOUT THE WHOLE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE OF LIKE. WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT'S DOING NEW. AND SO EVERY NOW AND THEN I THINK TO MYSELF SO -- THERE ARE. AND YOU BY GNOME BUT FROM. PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THAT ARE DOING THIS VERY SUCCESSFULLY ALREADY. ARMY RECREATING THE WHEEL HERE ARE IS ARE WE TAKING SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND EDUCATION THAT WE'RE GETTING FROM OTHER -- COUNTRIES INTO CONSIDERATION AND DO WE HAVE TEST PLOTS THAT WE CAN SEE SOME OF THAT ACTUALLY. WORKING NOW -- YEAH THERE'S NO QUESTION WE'VE LOOKED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY -- OUR DAIRY INDUSTRY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT EVEN THAN THE REST OF THE NATION IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF LAGOONS. AND THE GREEN DYE JESTERS ARE NOT VERY COMMON IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY CERTAINLY NOT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. OF AGAINST DON'T WORK VERY LONG WISCONSIN IN THE WINTERTIME SO THEY'VE THEY'VE TENDED TO STAY WAY THEY TURNED ICE SKATING RINKS THOUGH -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE HAVE SORT OF TAKEN THOSE TECHNOLOGIES AND ADAPTED THEM TO CALIFORNIA. AND SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE OF THE COVERED THE GOON VARIETY HERE THAN WE'VE SEEN ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A FEW PLUG FLOW DIE JESTERS OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. MORE BEING PROPOSED AND THERE HAVE. THEY ARE WIDELY USED IN GERMANY AND THOSE HAVE NOT PERFORMED PARTICULARLY WELL HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T BE FURTHER ADAPTED AND REMOVED. WERE WERE TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC AS AN INDUSTRY WE SUPPORT BOTH THE AND PROGRAM AND THE DIGESTIVE PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT EVERY DAIRY CAN INSTALL AND I JUST HER. NOR GROUP WHO WOULD WE WANT EVERY DAIRY TO PUT IT DIE JESTER AND SO THE ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMS. BECOME EQUALLY IMPORTANT BUT WE ARE DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH. ON THE CAMPSITE IN PARTICULAR THE ALTERNATE MINORE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE SIDE BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE THINK THERE CAN BE A LOT OF ADDITIONAL ADVANCEMENTS. THE DIGEST HER STUFF'S PRETTY SOLIDLY RESEARCH WE'VE GOT A PROTOCOL WE CAN GENERATE CREDITS. WE WANT TO GET THE APP PROGRAM TO THE SAME LEVEL WHERE WE CAN GENERATE. GREENHOUSE GAS CREDIT REDUCTION SO THAT FARMERS CAN GET SOME. REVENUE FROM THOSE PROJECTS. DIE JESTER FOR BIDE REVENUE WHICH MAKES THEM VERY COST EFFECTIVE. THE AND PROGRAMS ARE ALSO ARE PROJECTS ARE ALSO COST EFFECTIVE BUT THEY DON'T HAVE A REVENUE STREAM GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM SO WE CAN DO THE RESEARCH. DOCUMENT THE REDUCTIONS THAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE GET PROTOCOLS DEVELOPED LIKE WE HAVE FOR THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. OR THE RICE INDUSTRY HAS FOR I THINK THE ONLY TWO IN AGRICULTURE THAT HAVE PROTOCOLS. THEN WE CAN GET CREDITS FOR THOSE AND GENERATE REVENUE YOU. SO WELL ENCOURAGING THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK WITH US TO GET THOSE BUTTON PLACE QUICKLY COULD GO A LONG WAY. AND REDUCED HIM TO SOME DEGREE THAN. SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING ACROSS THE BOARD WE'D TRY NOT TO DUPLICATE EFFORTS BUT WE DO TRY TO LEARN FROM WHAT'S BEEN DONE ELSEWHERE. DO YOU HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED TO GET TO DO SOME OF THIS WORK SOME. AND THAT'S WHERE I'M HITTING A WALL. I'M SORRY BEING PUBLISHED THAT YOU HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED BEFORE ANY SOME OF THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE USED IN CALIFORNIA. HOMEBREW. NO I DON'TKNOW THAT DID TO ITS REALLY STOPPING TECHNOLOGIES FROM BEING USED I THINK THE RESEARCH TO BE CONSIDERED VALID BY A OR B. AND OTHERS. NEEDS TO BE PUBLISHED WHICH IS WHY WE'RE WAITING FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND STUDY TO BE PUBLISHED. IT WILL BE SHORTLY BUT FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO HELP YOU DO THAT HOW CAN YOU. MAKE THESE. AMEND WE'RE SO WE'RE WASTING TIME RIGHT LISTS HANDSOME BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS THERE A WAY -- TO GET. YOUR INFORMATION YOU NEED. PUBLISHED IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THAT IT CAN USE YET WE'RE WORKING. AB ABOUT AS WELL AS AN INDUSTRY CAN WORK WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE AND EVERYTHING NOT BY A LONG SHOT BUT THEY'RE WORKING VERY COOPERATIVELY WITH THIS INDUSTRY. TO HELP US ACHIEVE THE REDUCTIONS IT'S A GREAT WORKING. YOU CAN ALWAYS BE BETTER -- BUT THEY'RE NOT STANDING IN THE WAY THERE WE WE ARE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO GET THE INFORMATION WE NEED. TO GET THROUGH THESE VARIOUS PROTOCOLS AND AND GET THE THINGS ESTABLISHED AS PAUL CAN ATTEST TO THAT THE RIGHTS COMMISSION THEY TAKE TIME -- HIM BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE DONE CAREFULLY SO THAT THEY'RE ACCURATE WHICH IS WHY WERE OUT DOING THE RESEARCH TO VERIFY THE REDUCTION. YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHAT DIE JESTERS WHAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF REDUCTIONS IT'S WELL DOCUMENTED HAS FOR YEARS WERE NOT QUITE THERE BUT WE'LL BE THERE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY IS PUTTING UP A LOT OF THAT MONEY. AND THE STATE'S MATCHING THAT WITH US IN WORKING WITH US TO GET THOSE REDUCTIONS. ARE YOU KNOW HAVE PART OF THOSE OF RECENT COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH THEIR BE IS THERE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOME VERY SOPHISTICATED TOWERS. IN SOME OF THESE DAIRIES WERE INSTALLING THESE ALTERNATE NOR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO WE CAN GAIN A COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE EMISSIONS PROFILE WE'RE NOT JUST LOOK AT NOTHING. WE WANT TO KNOW ARE THERE OTHER TRADE OFFS OTHER BENEFITS WE KNOW THE DIGEST YEARS PROVIDE TREMENDOUS OTHER. BENEFITS HOW REDUCING OTHER POLLUTANTS ON THE DAIRY WE WANT TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE SAME THINGS OCCURRING WITH THESE ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES. AND DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S HOW WE MAKE THE CASE. FOR BETTER MAKE THE CASE FOR MORE MONEY GOING FORWARD SO. YOU HAVE GOT AYE MY MIND IS LIKE TO GET STUFF DONE NOW. AND IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE FARMERS IN THE DAIRY MEN ARE COMING TO ME AND JUST SAYING -- WHERE PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN OUR WAY -- I'M JUST SAYING IS THAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP MOVE THINGS ALONG -- YOU KNOW I'M ONLY HERE FOR SO LONG. AND YOU KNOW IT. THE WORLD'S CHANGING PLACE AND HOW MUCH LONGER CAN WE WAIT SO IT'S MY FRUSTRATION SO IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED I MEAN WHO WE ARE WHERE WE ARE AS AN AND ST WITH THESE EFFORTS SPEAK. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS STOOD UP FOR US AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT TO GET THE FUNDING. AND I THINK WE'VE SHOWN THAT IT'S GOOD BANG FOR THE BUCK AND SO HOPEFULLY IT WILL CONTINUE IN THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION AND WE WILL ONLY HELP. WITH THAT. WITHOUT A DOUBT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THAT TRANSITION AND SO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE EDUCATION PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN. I LIKE FOR US MORE PUBLIC PART OF PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR ACTIVE. AND I THINK -- HAVING THE PRIVATE SIZE THERE TO HAVE THE MONEY TO HELP FUND AS WELL AS MEAN AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO THINK STATE CAN DO IT ALL. WE CAN MEAN OF SO MANY THINGS TO DO BUT IF WE CAN FORM THESE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE REALLY BENEFICIAL. AND RUSS AND FOR YOU AND THE GUY JUST A PROGRAMS A GREAT EXAMPLE ABOUT 30% ON AVERAGE OF THE FUNDING FOR THE DIGEST HERS COMES IN THE GRANT. FROM THE REST IS COMING FROM THE FARMERS OR OTHER EQUITY THAT WE HAVE TO GO OUT FOR DEBT THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE ON FROM BANKS AND OTHER SOURCES SO IT IS A NICE TO LEVERAGE SITUATION. YOU KNOW THAT TURNED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO BE MORE LIKE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE. IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA SO THE OTHER THREE QUARTERS OF THAT IS COMING FROM INDUSTRY AND OTHER SOURCES SO. THAT'S YOUR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AT WORK. IS THERE A WAY -- TO TO MARKET. THE HIGH SUSTAINABILITY YEAR THAT. EXTRA -- AT THEY MAKE IT SEE THE BENEFIT OF OF ALL OF THAT WORK IT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND THE I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA MILK ADVISORY BOARD WHICH IS THE MARKETING ARM OF THE CALIFORNIA DAIRY INDUSTRY IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH US. AND LOOKING AGES OF SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES HOW THE PLANET SMART BARRIER PLANETS RIGHT MELT YOU KNOW IS IS MY LITTLE EFFORT TO BRAND THIS A LITTLE BIT -- THERE THE PROFESSIONALS THEY'RE GONNA TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT LEVEL BUT THERE IS A MARKET FOR THERE'S NO QUESTION AND PEOPLE ARE WHAT PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUSTAINABLE. AND I YOU KNOW WE THINK WE'VE GOT A MUCH MORE SUSTAINABLE DAIRY INDUSTRY HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- THE REST OF THE COUNTRY'S PRETTY GOOD AS WELL. BUT WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT CALIFORNIA VERSUS THE REST OF THE WORLD IT'S LIGHT YEARS IN TERMS OF OUR OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT IN PARTICULAR FOR EVERY GALLON ENOUGH PRODUCE. RIGHT THOUGH THAT'S WHAT THAT'S MY THOUGHT IS THAT IF THERE'S A WAY TO MARKET IT'S IT'S SO. MANY PEOPLE WILL BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT AND WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING THAT THAT THAT PRODUCT HAS IT HAS A VALUE. SO THAT'S GREAT UP MISTER CHANDLER WANTED TO ASK YOU -- THIS YEAR. OB WANTED THE ATTEMPTS I MADE WAS TO DO A FARM BILL THAT WOULD CREATE -- AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO LOOK AT TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM Y. ACTUALLY WAS FOR ALL FOR ALL FARMING BUT THE INNER TO THE BENEFIT OF SMALL AND MEDIUM. FARMS IF THERE IF IT FOR IT. DOES IT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO TRY TO TO PUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT TOGETHER THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR FARMS TO BE ABLE TO USE THE KIND OF OF EFFICIENCIES THAT YOU'D YOU DESCRIBED IT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU'RE. YOU'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT AND WHAT REALLY HELPED IN THE TRACTOR AREA WAS HAVING THOSE RESOURCES AVAILABLE THROUGH THE AIR BOARD AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN [inaudible] CREATE THOSE. OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THE BETTER. THE MORE THAT WE CAN SAY THAT MIGHT YOU KNOW MIGHT MY INTEREST IS MAKING SURE THAT AGRICULTURE IS SUSTAINABLE AND THAT IT IT IS. HOT [inaudible] IT IS. ABLE TO CONTINUE IN THE STATE AND SO I'M AND A BIG CONCERN IS THE LOS OF SMALL FARMS. COM SOME JUST WONDERING IF IF I'LL BE BACK AGAIN AND I'LL BE I'LL HAVE A IT WOULD I PUT EVERYTHING IN IT BUT THE KITCHEN SINK IN. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO THAT THE FIRST TIME PEOPLE THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THEY DON'T LIKE BUT BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME REAL. I'M INTEREST IN THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT PERFORMING IN SO THESE PROGRAMS IN THE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. ARE ONE POTENTIAL SOURCE WE USE TO HAVE THE WILLIAMS WILLIAMSON ACT IS ANOTHER -- WE'RE DOING SOME GREAT LAND CONSERVATION -- WORK AS WELL BUT IT. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THE MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX THAT THERE ARE THAT THAT IT MAY BE HELPFUL AND I'M WONDERING WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU THOUGHT YOU THINK THINK ABOUT THAT INCENTIVE SIR. TAX CREDITS Y. I THINK -- THE INCENTIVES OF AN ENORMOUSLY POWERFUL IN THAT YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIA IS THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCING SATAN ON A GIVEN THIS ROOM WOULD AGREE WITH THAT -- BUT WE'RE ALSO PROBABLY THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY AWARE STATE AND THERE'S A COST TO THAT. AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT WHEN YOUR CONCERN IS IS -- THAT THE SMALL MEDIUM SIZED FARMS -- I HAVE A TOUGHER TIME WITH THAT COST BECAUSE THEY ARE UNABLE TO SPREAD IT OUT AND THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN A VERY HELPFUL -- AND THAT THE TWO THAT I TALKED ABOUT THE TWO STATE PROGRAMS -- UP I'VE I'VE WORKED WITH HAVE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND AS A FARMER MY MY MAIN JOB IS FARMING IT'S NOT APPLYING FOR PROGRAMS -- WHEN I APPLY FOR FEDERAL PROGRAM THEY CAN BE A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS AND I SPEND A LOT OF TIME HAVING TO FILL OUT A LOT OF FORUMS AND I HAVE A LOT OF -- FOLLOW UPS AND AND WHAT NOT KNOW WHAT WITH THE POWER OF THE STATE PROGRAMS -- THAT I'VE HAD EXPERIENCE WITH AND WHY I THINK THEY'VE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IS THEIR VERY USER FRIENDLY -- CDFA MANAGES -- THE SWEET PROGRAM AND THAT THEY'RE VERY EASY TO WORK WITH THEIR VERY STRAIGHT FOR THEY HAVE VERY TOUGH -- STANDARDS THEY WANT YOU TO MEET BUT THEY HELP YOU UNDERSTAND -- HOW YOU CAN WORK TO MEET THOSE SO I IT'S IT'S VERY AGGRESSIVE IN TRYING TO GET GROWERS ENGAGED IN THAT I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL -- WITH THE TRACTOR REPLACEMENT -- THERE AGAIN IT IS VERY USER FRIENDLY IT'S FOR THE GROWERS IT'S VERY SIMPLE MATTER OF GOING THROUGH THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND THERE'S HELP READILY AVAILABLE. AND I THINK THAT -- ALONG WITH THE DRIVE -- STATEWIDE HAS A BEEN A LARGE PART WHY THOSE PROGRAMS AND HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL AND WHY FOR FOR MY FARM I FIND THEM -- VERY HELPFUL JUST BECAUSE AS I'M LOOKING AT NEW STANDARDS OR OR NEW REGULATIONS ORA EVEN BEFORE THEY HAPPEN WILL -- THEY HELPED ME BE AHEAD OF THE CURVE OR MEET THE NEW STANDARDS WITHOUT HAVING TO MOVE BASICALLY MORTGAGE THE FAR RIGHT. RIGHT THAT'S GREAT APPRECIATED VERY MUCH -- IN THEN ALSO ON THE I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ACTUALLY AND I WAS DOING A SITES RESERVOIR TOUR AND I ENDED UP OUT THERE -- JUST AROUND THE TIME AT THE END OF THE SEASON -- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THERE IT WAS IT WAS FANTASTIC. TO I'VE ACTUALLY AVERAGE JUST. TALKING TO CECILIA ABOUT IT IS -- TO ACTUALLY GO. PASSED A FARM WHERE -- BIRDS HAVE BEEN -- FEEDING I GUESS IS THE BEST WAY TO SAY IT FOR AND TO SEE THEM NOTHING MORE POWERFUL. TO SEE NATURE CAN AT ITS BEST DOING WHAT IT DOES AND THEN TO FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TOTALLY INCONSEQUENTIAL SHINTO I MEAN IT REALLY WAS PHENOMENAL AND SO. I BECOME A REAL A REAL FAN OF OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- TO CREATE HABITAT AND TO PROVIDE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE SHOREBIRDS AND IS WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE THE WATER LEAVING THE RICE FIELDS AND MOVING MOVING ON DOES ANY OF THAT WATER GET. FURTHER SOUTH OF OF THE OF THE RICE FIELDS -- ME IN AND I THE REASON I ASK THAT IS IS THE SIGNIFICANT AREA WHERE THERE IS. UP WETLANDS THAT HAS BEEN CREATED WITH FARMLAND AND WITH -- SOME CONSERVATION GROUPS IS AND IS IN MISTER GRAY'S -- DISTRICT WHICH IS ROB RIGHT THERE OFF OF THE NINETY NINE FREEWAY. ACTUALLY IT'S THAT IT'S A FIVE FREE WEIGHT OVER TO THE NINE NINE FREEWAY AND THAT THAT -- PROPERTY IS JUST INCREDIBLE AND ITS THOUSANDS OF ACRES AND A BIG CHALLENGES HAVING. IT BE PARTICULARLY IN THAT AREA IT'S HAVING ENOUGH WATER AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WATER IN THE DIFFERENT FIELDS FOR THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AND SO. THE MORE THAT WE CAN WORK OUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE ABLE. TO TO TO USE THE WATER THAT WE HAVE AS MANY TIMES AS POSSIBLE FOR AS MANY USES. AS POSSIBLE IN IT WHICH IS I THINK TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND AND IF YEAR IF THERE IS RESEARCH THAT'S BEING DONE IN TERMS OF THE KINDS OF OF OF PLANT MATERIALS. THAT ARE THAT MIGHT BE GOOD. TO ALSO TAKE -- FURTHER SOUTH NEAR GROWING RICE AND MAYBE IT'S SEEDING SOME RICE IN THIS PARTICULAR REGION JUST SO THAT THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT -- OPPORTUNITIES FOR HERB FOR BIRDS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE UP AND DOWN -- THAT. CALIFORNIA I THINK THE MORE INFORMATION WE HAVE THE MORE DATA WE HAVE THE MORE SCIENCE WE USE I THINK. WOULD BE TREMENDOUSLY THREAT TRYING TO MEND THE SAY IMPORTANT I'VE I'VE ALSO BEEN OUT. BOB TO THOSE WETLANDS AND IT'S IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT VARIETY OF BIRDS THAT YOU SEE AND THAT THOSE ARE DEBT CLUBS THAT ARE KEEPING THAT THAT GOING SO SURE VERY IMPORTANT. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVEA QUESTION THERE IN I DON'T KNOW IF MR GRAY HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU EITHER BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT DOT. THAT I I WAS TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED WITH -- THE AMOUNT OF OF WILDLIFE THAT'S THAT IS. THAT LIVES IN THAT AREA. RIGHT AFTER THE RACE -- HARVEST IS DONE IN THE FACT THAT THERE IS. PEPPER PRODUCE STILL IN THE FIELD I THINK IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT AND HOW DO WE MARKET THAT. TO THE PUBLIC. NOT THAT HAS NO CLUE THAT THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE GOING ON I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY AS WELL SHARE WHICH ARE GREAT. THANK YOU -- MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE NICE COMMENTS ABOUT MY DISTRICT WERE VERY PROUD OF IT -- IT IT IS UNDER APPRECIATED LET ME JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE TRAVEL UP AND DOWN THAT I'VE I FIVE FREEWAY AND HAVE NO CLUE THAT THAT WETLANDS IS THERE I MEAN I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY. DOES WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE TESTIMONY IT'S NICE. TO BE HERE IN THE HALLS. OF THE CAPITOL ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURE -- IT'S TOO OFTEN THAT -- WERE CRITICIZED AND FRANKLY -- I DON'T THINK AGRICULTURE SPEAKS UP. A IN ITS OWN DEFENSE ENOUGH HERE EARLIER THIS YEAR I WROTE AN OP ED WHEN MY LOCAL PAPERS. TELL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A FARMER AND IT CAME FROM A MEETING I HAD WITH A CERTAIN. U. S. KING ARE CANDID FOR U. S. SENATE -- WITH A BUNCH OF FOR MY CONSTITUENTS ARE WERE TALKING BUT I CULTURE IN THE DIFFERENT OPERATIONS IN MY DISTRICT AND AND EVERY SINGLE CONSTITUENT AT THIS PARTICULAR MEETING INTRODUCED THEMSELVES AS A SMALL FAMILY FARMERS. YOUR SOME OF THEM ARE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS SUMMER REALLY BIG FAMILY FARMERS -- BUT THEIR FAMILY FARMERS -- BUT AT THE END OF ALL THAT I GOT THE UP TO SPEAK I SAID YOU KNOW ONE OF THINGS A TIRED OF IS THAT. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR OUR INDUSTRY. ON THE IN THOSE TERMS BECAUSE IT FOR BIG GAG OR EVIL. AND AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GOTTA SILICON VALLEY DO THE GOOGLE DESCRIBES ITSELF AS A SMALL FAMILY TECH. FOR DO THEY HAVE TO APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR SUCCESSES YOU KNOW THEY DON'T AND SAID SO GRANT THAT WISH THAT'S PAUL GESTURES AND THAT'S AGAIN. THANK YOU MANAGER FOR LONG OVERDUE PUT AND HE TO CELEBRATE A LOT OF THE GOOD WORK THAT GOES ON EVERYDAY. ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN MY DISTRICT WERE SHOULD PROUD OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE IN MY PART OF THE WORLD IS WHAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. SO THAT BRINGS US -- TO THE NEXT PANEL WHICH IS ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS AND SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE STEPHANIE LARSON. PHD DIRECTOR OF THE U. S. COOPERATIVE EXTENSION CINEMA COUNTY -- CINEMA COUNTY LIVESTOCK AND RANGE MANAGEMENT ADVISER THAT'S A LONG [inaudible] TITLE. UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DIVISION OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES WELCOME WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COME BEFORE YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YES I AM US STEPHANIE LARSON. AND MY RESEARCH AND EDUCATION PROGRAM TOM -- DOCUMENTS AND INTEGRATES ECOSYSTEM SERVICES PROVIDED BY RANGELANDS HIGHLIGHTING THE BENEFITS OF USING GRAZING ANIMALS AS TOOLS TO MANAGE SHE'S WORKING LANDSCAPES. I'M A CERT RANGE LAND MANAGER. I WORK WITH LAND MANAGERS HELPING THEM TO MAKE SOUND ECOLOGICAL DECISIONS TO MANAGE WORKING LANDSCAPES FOR THE BENEFITS OF ALL USERS. I'M SPEAKING TODAY IS AN EXPERT WITHIN MY FIELD AND AS A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL. I'M NOT AS AN OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL A MEMBERS AHEAD OF ME AND THEY'VE KIND OF SET THE STAGE IN A SENSE -- FOR A DIALOGUE THAT I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN HAVE IN THIS IN THIS SESSION AND TALKING ABOUT WORKING LANDSCAPES AND IS THAT IT'S A TERM THAT'S THAT WE USE. AND IT'S ALL FOR MORE RELEVANT IN A HOW DO WE KEEP OUR LANDSCAPES WORKING WHEN I THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S WORKING LANDSCAPES THE INCLUDE FARMLAND. RANCHES RANGELANDS FOREST WETLANDS MINES WATER BODIES AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCE LANCE FOR BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC. THEY BENEFIT US FROM CLEAN WATER AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD TO CLIMATE STABILITY AND OUTDOOR RECREATION AND THE PROVIDES ESSENTIAL BENEFITS FOR OUR ECONOMY OUR HEALTH IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE. AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE CROSSED ALL ASPECTS OF AGRICULTURE THIS AFTERNOON. AND HE'S ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE OFTEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED AND I THINK WHAT WE WE FIND IS THAT AGRICULTURE CAN BE VERY SILO. AND THEY ARE THEY'RE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH WHAT THEY PROVIDE AND THEY'RE VERY PROUD AS YOU HEARD JUST BEFORE ME ON THAT ON THE SUCCESS STORIES THAT THEY HAVE. BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC DOESN'T HEAR THESE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES I THINK WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT AGRICULTURE THEY THINK ABOUT FOOD. THEY THINK ABOUT THE THE WATER THAT WE'RE USING TO GROW THAT FOOD. AND THEY'RE QUESTIONING HOW WE'RE GROWING THAT FOOD IS IT IS IT SUSTAINABLE IS THAT ORGANIC IS A SMALL SCALE IS AT LARGE SCALE. THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT THE CROSS SECTION OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT THESE WORKING A LANDSCAPES PROVIDE. AND THERE ARE WILL BECAUSE ARE TAKEN FOR GRANTED THERE'S A MARKET FIRE THAT HITS PARTICULARLY HARD IN THE RURAL AREAS. AND SO A STRONGER FRAMEWORK FOR MAPPING VALUE IN INVESTING ECOSYSTEM SERVICES CAN ENSURE THOSE WHO MANAGE THESE CALIFORNIA WORKING LANDS OR FARMERS AND RANCHERS WILL BENEFIT FROM STEWARDING THEM. SO I WANT TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SOME GOING FORWARD AND HOW WE CAN. REALLY A SASS AND AND CHAMPION WHAT AGRICULTURE IS DOING RIGHT. AND I THINK WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND AGAIN UNFORTUNATE THEIR SENSE TO BE A LOT OF JARGON WORDS WITH ECOSYSTEM SERVICES BUT IT'S THE WAY THAT NATURE PROVIDES FOR THE WELL BEING OF PEOPLE. INCLUDES A BIOLOGICAL NECESSITY SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT CLEAN WATER NUTRITIOUS FOOD IN A LIVABLE CLIMATE AS WELL AS INDIRECT ECONOMIC BENEFITS SUCH AS JOB IN REVENUE. CREATED ALONG THE THE FOOD VALUE CHAINS. MORE BROADLY TO ENCOMPASS INTANGIBLE GOODS AND CONTRIBUTE TO A HUMAN WELL BEING SUCH AS RECREATION ASCETIC INSPIRATION A CULTURAL CONNECTION. WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON IS THAT THEY DEPEND ON NATURAL CAPITAL OR IN OTHER WORDS GENERATED OF CAPITAL? UP ABILITIES OF NATURAL SYSTEMS OR WORKING LANCE SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE MILLENNIAL. ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IT THERE'S A LOT OF WORDS BUT WHEN YOU BOIL IT DOWN THERE'S LIKE PROVISIONING OR WATER. SO THE PROVISIONING SERVICES SO WHAT DO THESE AGRICULTURAL LANDS PROVIDE. AND SO WHAT I'M BUT GOING FORWARD WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS START DOCUMENTING THOSE SUCCESS STORIES AND LOOKING AT CASE STUDIES AND ASKING OURSELVES YOU KNOW WHERE MIGHT WE FIND SOME WAYS TO HIGHLIGHT THESE. AND TO INCENTIVIZE THESE FOR OUR FOLKS THAT ARE MANAGING THOSE LANDS SOME YOU'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT THIS IS THE STORY OF NEW YORK CITY. WHERE THEY HAD TO TO LOOK AT APPLY A WATER SOURCE TO ALL THE PEOPLE? AND SO THEY LOOKED AT NINETEEN HUNDRED SQUARE MILES BETWEEN AT THE CATSKILLS IN THE DELAWARE WATERSHEDS IN UPPER STATE NEW YORK [inaudible] AND THEY INTO AND THEY CREATED ONE OF THE LARGEST ENGINEERED WATER SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES. SO THEY WORKED WITH THE PRIVATE LAND OWNERS. TO HELP THEM IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THIS LAND THIS WATER TO COME THROUGH THE LAND. BOTH URBAN AND RURAL RESIDENTS BENEFITTED FROM AN AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDES LAND ACQUISITION. CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AND COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR FARM. A RIGHT PERRY NEARS AND FORESTS SO TOOK ALL OF THOSE THINGS SO IT'S FROM THE THE FOR WHERE THE WATER FALLS. TO THE END USERS. SO GOING FORWARD ONE RECOMMENDATION COULD BE -- TO CREATE AND EXPAND MARKETS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND MIGHT ONE OPTION MIGHT BE IN THESE WERE INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKETS. USE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING DISTRICTS OR SIMILAR MECHANISMS TO CREATE LOCAL OR REGIONAL MARKETS FOR NATURAL WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. SO ITS INCORPORATING THE COST OF CONSERVING NATURAL CAPITAL SUCH AS AN UPPER WATERSHED FOREST OR RIGHT PAIRING CORRIDORS INCENTIVIZING THAT FOR LANDOWNERS TO IMPROVE THE FORCE MANAGEMENT THE RIGHT PAYING CORRIDORS. AND THEN THE WATER FEES ARE PAID BY THE END USERS WHO BENEFIT FROM THAT CAPITAL SO HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO THE PUBLIC TO SAY. YOUR BENEFITING FROM THE WATER THAT FALLS ON THESE AGRICULTURE LANDS AND FROM THAT STANDPOINT WE'RE GOING TO CHARGE YOU EXTOL THERE'S YOU KNOW. FOR THE USE OF THAT WATER. SO THAT MIGHT BE A WAY TO AT LEAST START TO MAKE THAT THAT CONNECTION THAT PEOPLE -- DON'T REALLY HAVE THE PUBLIC MISSES THE FACT THAT AGRICULTURE LANDS ARE PROVIDING THE WATER. YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT THE VALUE OF OF AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS -- I THINK ONE INTERESTING STATISTIC IS THAT -- UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA'S AGRICULTURAL ISSUES CENTER FOUND THAT A COMBINED MULTIPLIER EFFECT OF TWO POINT. SEVEN IN IT FOR EVERY DOLLAR FARM GATE THERE WAS ANOTHER DOLLAR AND TWENTY SEVEN CENTS ADDED TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY. SO THAT AGRICULTURE PRODUCTION IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE ACT OF THE ECONOMY IN THAT DOLLAR COMES YOU ADDED JOBS AND AND PRODUCTS AND SALES SO IT'S HIGHLIGHTING THAT. SO WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT TODAY ABOUT ANOTHER OPTION MIGHT BE TO EXPAND EXISTING MARKETS FOR FARM LAND AND RANGE LAND CONSERVATION AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT -- CERTAIN PROBLEMS PROGRAMS SUCH AS SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE LANDS CONSERVATION PROGRAM. AND THAT'S PROVIDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. BY CONSERVATION EASEMENTS BUT WHAT ABOUT IF WE WERE TO NOT MORE ALSO ALSO PAY FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES SO WE HAVE THESE LANDS AND WHERE WERE. WERE A SETTING THEM ASIDE. FOR IN PERPETUITY SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE DEVELOPED. WHAT IS HAPPENED IS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN? FIRST SECOND AND NOW THIRD AND FOURTH GENERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THOSE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS AND THEY THE FOURTH GENERATIONS ARE STRUGGLING ON HOW HOW DO THEY MAKE MONEY OFF THOSE LANDS. HOW DO WE HOW DO WE MAKE? KEEP THOSE LANDS ACTIVE AND AND SO WHAT I'VE DONE IS WE DID SOME RESEARCH AND WE ASSESSED IN THIS WAS IN MARIN AND SONOMA COUNTY ON TWO VERY ESTABLISHED LAND TRUST AND ASK THE QUESTION ABOUT. WOULD YOU TAKE ONGOING PAYMENTS OR WHERE YOU ARE USE SOLID WITHOUT MOM SOME WELL SURPRISINGLY THE FOLKS THAT TOOK THE LUMP SUM OF THE ORIGINAL CONSERVATION EASEMENT LIKE GRANDPA HE THOUGHT THAT WAS A GREAT -- DEAL BUT GRAND SON OR DAUGHTER COMING ON THIRD YOU KNOW TH GENERATION IS LOOKING AT HOW DO I KEEP THIS LAND GOING I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY ALL I CAN SELL IS A COUPLE OF COWS -- SO HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS WHAT IF THESE CONSERVATION EASEMENT PAYMENTS WORD WERE DONE OVER TIME. GIVING FOLKS THE OPTION TO LOOK AT INVESTING THAT MONEY AND THEN PAYMENTS OVER TIME THAT IS MORE OF A SUCCESSION PLANNING FOR FARMING SO THAT KEEPS THEM GOING. SO THAT'S THE IDEA THAT. SON GRANDSON DAUGHTER GRANDDAUGHTER ALL KNOW THAT THEY ARE GUARANTEED PAYMENTS FOR A EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME SO THAT'S GOING TO BE INCENTIVIZING THAT AND THEN LOOKING AT OKAY YOU'VE SOLDIER DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. WHAT IF WE PAGE YOU TO SEQUESTER CARBON WHAT IF WE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON FARMING THAT YOU DID WHAT YOU PUT COMPOST ON IT FOR THE MOVE TO A MORE? PERENNIAL SYSTEM AT IN WOODY VEGETATION UP. PAIN FOR POLLINATION AYE INC INCREASE SEEN THAT CARBON WHAT ABOUT IF YOU HAD WATER. ATTENTION WHAT IF YOU WERE HOLDING WATER IN CAPTURING WATER WHAT IF YOU PAID FOR THAT LIKE SOME OF THAT -- PROGRAMS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER SO IS THIS IDEA THAT MAYBE OF SOLDIER DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS IN PERPETUITY BUT WHAT ABOUT ONGOING PAYMENTS OF OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES. SO THAT COULD BE ANOTHER. ANOTHER IDEA -- I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FROM AN EDUCATIONAL STANDPOINT AND AND THIS IS WHAT WE'VE DONE KIND OF IT WAS A FUN PROJECT BUT IT REALLY IS AND PACTUAL. IS WHERE. ONE ANOTHER ECOSYSTEM SERVICES IS CULTURAL ITS RECREATIONAL AND SOUL COLLIGAN I LOOKED AT THE REGIONAL PARKS THE THE PARKS LETTER GRACED. IN -- IN THE BAY AREA AND IN IN A NORTHERN SONOMA COUNTY. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE WERE WANDERING AS OUR HIKING AROUND WHY OTHER COWS OUT THERE. AND SO OR THERE WAS INCIDENTS WHERE COWS AND DOGS DIDN'T MIX VERY WELL AND PEOPLE ARE HIKING SO WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE FOLKS. AND SAY THIS IS WHY WE HAVE CAL. IT'S TO REDUCE FIRE FUEL IS TO IMPROVE OUR HABITAT IT'S FOR BIODIVERSITY AND WE PUT UP SIGNS WE MADE YOU KNOW EDUCATIONAL PACKETS AND SO FOLKS ARE MORE COMFORTABLE IN SAYING Y. UNDERSTAND WHY THERE ARE ANIMALS GRAZING OUT HERE. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS EXPANDING THAT THOSE PROJECTS IN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR AREAS THAT ARE. THAT HAVE BEEN OR COULD BE IMPACTED BY THE RECENT FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD AND SO IT'S THIS IDEA OF OF GENERATING MAPPING TO SHOW THAT AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN GRACED OR AREAS THAT HAD AGRICULTURE. DIDN'T BURN ES SEVERELY OR THE FIRE STOPPED THERE AND SO IT'S TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ST WE NEED TO MANAGE THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES WHETHER IT'S MANAGING OUR TIMBER WHETHER IT'S GRAZING -- AND I'M ALSO STARTING. BACK OF PRESCRIBED BURNING ASSOCIATIONS AND TALKING TO COLLEAGUES THAT THEY DID THIS FIFTY YEARS AGO AND SO IT'S NOT LIKE REINVENTING THE WHEEL IS JUST MAKING THE WILL TURN AGAIN. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS. STARTING THE PROCESS OF WORKING WITH LANDOWNERS TO SAY HOW DO WE MANAGE VEGETATION WITH ALL THE TOOLS WHAT IF WE USE GRAZING BUT IF WE USE PRESCRIBED FIRE AND SO WHAT WE'RE STARTING TO DO IS WORK WITH CAL FIRE AND AIR DISTRICTS. AND AND LOOKING AT HOW DO WE DECIDE WHAT WHERE'S THE BEST WAY AND THAT THE MARKETS ECONOMIC WAY TO MANAGE THESE. THESE OF WORKING LANDSCAPES TO REDUCE FIRE -- IMPACTS [inaudible] NOW WHAT. PROBABLY GOING FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO NEED HELP WITH IS. IS THE AIRPORTS. AND A PENNY WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED OUT SOMETIMES THE REALLY AGREEABLE AND SOMETIMES BAY AREA THEY'RE NOT -- AS OPEN TO BERNIE. SO I THINK. THE FIRES ARE OUR A A TRAVESTY BUT THERE IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO START ASKING THE PUBLIC TO WORK WITH US ON MANAGING THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES SO THAT'S THAT'S AN EXCITING WAY THAT WE'RE GOING FORWARD. SO WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DOCUMENTING -- PILOT PROJECTS AND LOOKING AT SUCCESS STORIES THAT HAVE HAPPENED AND PERHAPS TAKING THE SANTA ANA WATERSHED AREA AND AND LOOKING OUT THE IMPACTS FROM THE TOP OF THE WATERSHED TO THE USERS AND LA AND JUST. TRYING TO EDUCATE THE ARM ALTHOUGH. A WHOLE CONTINUUM OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKING LANDSCAPES LOOKING AT THE KING'S RIVER BASIN IN AND WHAT I'M WORKING WITH FARMERS THERE WHO ARE FOR OUR OF DOING FLOOD MITIGATION. AND THEY HAVE THEIR DOING THAT IN PERPETUITY SO IT'S THIS WHOLE IDEA OF A CAVE THEY'RE ALREADY GETTING PAYMENTS TO DO THAT. SO WHAT IF SOME ADDITIONAL OR ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OR ADDITIONAL STACKING OF ECOSYSTEM SERVICES THAT COULD BE PROVIDED IN COULD BE ALSO PROVIDE MONEY FOR THAT. I THINK THE KEY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES IS THAT THE ECONOMICS OF THEM -- THE SOCIAL ASPECT OF IT AND ECOLOGICAL PEACE OF IT BUT IF YOU'RE OWNING LAND AND YOU WANTING TO KEEP IT FOR GENERATION AND GENERATION YOU HAVE TO MAKE MONEY AT IT SO WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE AS OPPOSED. TO REGULATE THESE LANDOWNERS AND THESE WORKING LANDSCAPES TO KEEP THEM ACTIVE AND KEEP THEM WORKING [inaudible] SO -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE. ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AND THAT FROM A SCIENCE STANDPOINT WERE ALSO LOOKING AT IDEAS OF INCREASING -- MARKETS FOR FOR CARBON MARKETS FOR HABITAT CONSERVATION AND SO LOOKING AT THOSE BENEFITS AND AND ENCOURAGING LANDOWNERS TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE ADD VALUE TO OUR WORKING LANDS PERHAPS TWO AGRITOURISM AND MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE SOME INCENTIVES. TO TO LOOK AT INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR AGRITOURISM AND REDUCING LIABILITY ISSUES THAT IMPACT THE BILL THE ABILITY TO BRING PEOPLE ONTO YOUR PROPERTY. BECAUSE OF SOMETHING HAPPENS ON THE PROPERTY THEN THE THE LANDOWNERS LIABLE AND SO THERE'S THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BRINGING IN TO SHOW TO SAY. HERE'S WHAT THEY DO IN OREGON THERE'S A REDUCE LIABILITY IT'S IT HELPS PEOPLE TO COME ON IN AND ADD VALUE TO THEIR PROPERTY. AND SO. ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WE WANT TO LOOK AT INCREASING MAPPING AND WHAT THE MAPPING SKILLS THAT WE CAN START TO DOCUMENT AND PRIORITIZE. WHERE'S THE BIGGEST -- OPPORTUNITIES TO DO SOME I IT IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THESE WORKING LAND PRACTICES AND HOW DO WE DOCUMENT THE THE BIGGEST -- RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT OF SOME OF THESE PROJECTS SO START TO BUILD THE CAPACITY AND TAKE ALL OF THESE GREAT STORIES THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER. AND LOOK OUT. DO WE HAVE THE SCIENCE TO BACK IT WHAT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH DO WE NEED TO DO AND HOW DO WE TELL THAT STORY. SO I'M JUST GIVING YOU AN OVERVIEW AND WHAT WHAT -- WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING WORKING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FORWARD -- AND THAT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMIC. SUMMIT IS THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICE WORKING LANDSCAPES IS BRINGING THIS CONCEPT FORWARD IN NOVEMBER. AND WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT THIS SO CREATED THIS ECOSYSTEM SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA WORKING LANDSCAPES PAPER. THAT -- WAS SENT. AND IT KIND OF JUST COVERS WHAT ECOSYSTEM SERVICES ARE IN SOME OF THOSE POTENTIAL THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION THERE AND SO WE BOIL DOWN TO THIS. AS ONE PAGER MAKES IT EASIER TO READ SO WITHOUT I WOULD I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE A DIALOGUE OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. MR LEVINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MISS LARSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION YOU REALLY TOUCHED ON A LOT OF ISSUESTHAT. YOU HAVE BEEN FROM THE NORTH BAY THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT ARE ALSO CERTAINLY STATEWIDE IN IN THEIR APPLICATION. CERTAIN WHAT ONE OF THE INSTANCES FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT IN THE NORTH BAY WE WERE REALLY PIONEERS IN ORGANIC MILK STRAUSS BEING THE FIRST IN THE STATE TO GO ORGANIC AND THEN. EVERYONE FIGURED OUT THIS WAS A WAY TO MAKE MONEY AND TO MAKE IT AS A SMALL DAIRY -- AND BE PROFITABLE AND EVERYONE FIGURED THAT OUT AND THERE'S A GLUT OF ORGANIC MILK AND THAT'S PUTTING A LOT OF PRESSURE ON OUR DAIRIES -- IN IN CERTAINLY WE'VE SEEN THE POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF OF HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WHICH IS AMAZING SHE'S. AND AND OF COURSE TOURISM THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE'VE REALLY BEEN ABLE TO TELL A VERY POSITIVE STORY FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS WE HEARD FROM ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES -- TO HILLS AGRICULTURE IS UNDER APPRECIATED. AND YOU I COME FROM A COUNTY WHERE WE ACTUALLY PASSED A SALES TAX. THAT GOES TO FUND EASEMENTS TO KEEP. DE OUR LAND AS WORKING AGRICULTURE SO WE AS RESIDENTS DECIDED TO TAX OURSELVES TO KEEP THE AGRICULTURAL HERITAGE. OF THE NORTH BAY AND IT'S A REALLY AMAZING STORY TO TELL IT'S ONE WHERE YOU KNOW AGRICULTURE IS NOT UNDER APPRECIATED AT ALL AND YOU THINK LIKE - EVERYONE OUT ON THE COAST DOESN'T CARE ABOUT BACK AND WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN INCLUDING PAIN OUT OF HER OWN POCKET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE. THAT LOCAL AGRICULTURE AND DIE IN A REAL SENSE THAT FARMING IS COOL. I THAT I FEEL WHENEVER ON ANYWHERE IN CINEMA OFF THE WELL NO ONE AND CERTAINLY OFF OF THAT ONE ONE IN MARIN. AS WELL -- AND IT'S IT'S JUST A VERY POSITIVE PERSON VERY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE WORKING LEADERSHIP THAT YOU DO I'M VERY EXCITED FOR THE COMIC SUMMIT BEAN IN CINEMA THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SHOW THAT OFF. AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S -- CLIMATE CHANGE SUMMIT WE WERE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO I TAKE PEOPLE TO WORKING LANCE. SURE SURE WITH A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HEALTHY SOILS INITIATIVE THAT WE HAVE EVEN TEACH THEM ABOUT OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND HOW THAT IMPACTS OUR OUR FARMING IN THE WATER. THAT WE DO ON THE COAST AS WELL AND SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF REALLY GOOD STORIES TO TELL SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK. THANK YOU I'M YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVING TO KEEP GOING KEEP IT STEPPING UP AND IN YOU YOU BRING UP A GOOD POINT ABOUT THE ORGANIC MALCOLM. IN THIS IS KIND OF A NEW THE NEXT PHASE. CINEMA COUNTY IN MARIN COUNTY. SMALLER SCALE DAIRIES BUT WHAT. WE HAD A COMPANY -- THOSE WALLABY. AND WHILE WE WAS BOUGHT BY A BIGGER COMPANY WHICH I THINK WAS BOUGHT BY A BIGGER COMPANY AND AS YOU AS YOU GET A WITH FARTHER AWAY FROM THE SOURCE OF THE MILK THE BIGGEST. THE OF THE CURRENT OWNER NOW REALLY DOESN'T CARE THAT STORY THEY'VE LOST THAT STORY AND SO NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THERE'S EIGHT ORGANIC DAIRIES THAT HAVE NO PLACE TO TAKE THEIR MILK. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S THE NEXT THING AND SO WERE ALWAYS HAVING TO KEEP WHAT'S THE NEXT STORY HOW DO WE TELL THAT WHAT'S THE NEXT PRODUCT THAT WE'RE GOING TO CREATE. WHETHER IT'S A KEY FOR OR ITS JOB ICE CREAM AND AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD ALWAYS USE MORE CHEESE BUT IT'S IT'S IT'S A IT'S ALWAYS. AGRICULTURE IS ALWAYS GOT TO KEEP GOING AND SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALSO IS IS TECHNOLOGY. AND ALLOWING AND NOT MAKING THAT THE REGULATIONS SO SO ONEROUS THAT THEY CAN APPLY THAT THE TECHNOLOGY AND I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY INTERESTED IN THEM -- THE MILKING TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU HAVE AUTOMATIC MELCHIOR'S BECAUSE THE LABOR SO SO DIFFICULT TO GET AND SO WITH THAT WHOLE IDEA OF OF TRYING TO BALANCE KEEPING THESE FAMILY FARMS -- ACTIVELY AND AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND YET MEETING THE NEEDS A COMMUNITY. IT'S GREAT WELL REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TODAY AND YOU'RE YOUR YOUR INFORMATION I THINK WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE WORKING LANDSCAPES AND TO REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT ARE THE POLICIES HERE AT THE STATE THAT WE CAN. CHANGE OR THAT WE CAN -- THAT WE CAN UTILIZE TO KEEP OUR OUR AGRICULTURE GOING -- MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS -- VISIT IF WE DON'T DO IT RIGHT WE START LOSING. AG LAND AND RANGE LAND AND AND ONCE IT STARTS MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION IT'S VERY HARD BECAUSE ONCE YOU BUILD ON IT THAT TALLER IS AND AND IN MY REGION -- THERE'S A REAL LACK OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SO PEOPLE HAVE TO DRIVE. IN THEIR IN THEIR VEHICLES AND SINCE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW ARE COMING FROM THE SILICON VALLEY INTO THEIR IN -- TO MY DISTRICT -- THE ROAD RACERS PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED DURING THAT THE PEAK TRAFFIC HOURS. AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES DO WE INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OR DO WE BUILD BIGGER ROADS. AND THE MILKMAN IT YOU START BUILDING BIGGER ROADS ARE SECT EXPECTATIONS -- AND AG LAND STARTS SEEMS. TWO EXPONENTIALLY TAKEOFF AND SO HOW WE SET. HOW WE WORK ON OUR POLICIES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WE HAVE WE HAVE [inaudible] PRECIOUS. FEW RESOURCES IN A NUMBER OF POTS AND WHERE THEY END UP GOING -- WILL DICTATE KIND OF THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE THE KIND OF DEVELOPMENT AND THE EXPANSION ON AG RANGE LAND AND SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PREPARED FOR SOME OF THAT REPERCUSSIONS IF WE DON'T PLAN. WELL AND LEAVE AND LEAVING IT UP TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THAT PLANNING SO IT IT SAM. THE MORE INFORMATION WE CAN GET OUT ABOUT WORKING LANCE AND ABOUT HOW -- HOW THEY OPERATE IN YOU INCLUDED A BUNCH OF LAND SAID I DIDN'T THINK I'M MORE FOCUSED ON REACH LAND PARK LAND IN AN ATLANTA? BUT THERE ARE ALL A LOT OF OTHER RESOURCES OUT THERE THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE RESEARCHER DOING AND AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING. WELL THANK YOU AND I I THINK IT'S WHAT I FIND IS THAT THERE. YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND A TOPIC THAT SOMEBODY'S INTERESTED IN AND WE HAVE A BURN MARIN COUNTY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF INTERESTED IN GRAZING ANIMALS AND DON'T OWN GRAZING ANIMALS BUT THEY THEY HAVE A PASSION FOR SEQUESTERING CARBON. AND IT'S JUST TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO EDUCATE THE FOLKS AND SAY WELL TO GET THE CARBON INTO THE SOIL IN THESE RANGE LANDS SOILS YOU HAVE TO USE A GRAZING ANIMAL YES AND AND SO THEN THERE THERE EXCEPT THAT BECAUSE THEY GET THE HEALTHY SOIL ASPECT OF IT AND SO. IT'S REALLY JUST FIGURING OUT HOW DO WE TELL THE AGRICULTURE STORY [inaudible] DIFFERENTLY. THEN THAT WE'RE RAISING ALL THIS FOOD IN ITS GREAT FOOD AND WE HAVE ALL THESE YOU KNOW. DIFFERENT THINGS THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE BUT THEN TO TAKE THAT'S WHERE I THINK THE KEY PIECES THE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND TALKING ABOUT THE THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT THEY GIVE US. WHAT WHAT WHAT I FOUND IMPRESSIVE IS THERE WAS AN ARTICLE ABOUT? A COUPLE IT BOUGHT A RANCH AND THEY GOT RID OF ALL THE ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS -- WELL THEY DIDN'T PLAN ON RAISING ANIMALS I GUESS NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS A THOUGHT IT WAS -- POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND SO -- IN THE END THERE THERE THERE THAT RANGE LAND STARTED -- DETERIORATING SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A VALUE IN HAVING THOSE ANIMALS AND THEY BROUGHT THEM BACK IN THEIR LEARNING NEW NEW -- NEW WAYS TO BE ABLE TO INTEGRATE THE ANIMALS IN WITH WITH THAT KIND OF HEALTHY SOILS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT WAS. THAT WAS IN NEW INFORMATION TO ME AND I FOUND IT FASCINATING BECAUSE IT WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THINGS WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION AND THEY THEY WERE WRONG AND THEY HAD THAT. GO BACK AND ACTUALLY RE DO THEIR THEIR PLANTS BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT THE ANIMALS HAD A BENEFIT TO THE LANDED SO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THE MORE THAT WE CAN TELL I THINK -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRACE POINT ABOUT -- PEOPLE'S ASSUMPTIONS IS THAT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION. AND MY CONCERN IS IS THAT. WHEN WE HAD A DROUGHT PEOPLE START THINKING ABOUT WHAT SHOULD WE NOT BE DOING ANY MORE? AND THE NOT BE DOING ANY MORE IS TO CAN AND CAN'T GROW. WHERE THEY CAN AND CAN'T GROW IT AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S THE WRONG TIME TO BE DOING THAT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IS WE'VE NEVER EVER BEEN A STATE WHERE WE TELL PEOPLE THEY CAN'T? THEY CAN'T DO THEIR BUSINESS ANYMORE. THE MARKET SHOULD CONTROL THAT NOT -- A A SCARCITY AND A TIME WHEN THEY WERE IN CRISIS SO ON THE MORE WE CAN GET THIS INFORMATION UP I THINK THE BETTER DECISIONS WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TAPI HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SO WHAT I WANNA DO IS ON AND THE NEXT ITEM IS PUBLIC COMMENT SOMEONE INVITE ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT TO THE COMMITTEE TO PLEASE COME FORWARD IF YOU COULD TELL US YOUR NAME. AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. MADAM CHAIR I WILL BE BRIEF MY NAME IS ADAM ROBIN I'M WITH THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WATER ASSOCIATION. NAKAL REPRESENTS A WATER SUPPLIERS INCLUDING WATER COMPANIES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES LANDOWNERS AND OTHERS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY WITH AN INTEREST IN HOW OUR WATER RESOURCES ARE MANAGED. HOW WE THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT HEARING THAT HAD HERE TODAY ON AND IN ADDITION TO UNDERSCORING THE BENEFITS OF RICE PRODUCTION THAT PAUL BUTLER EXPLAINED IN GREAT DETAIL I WANT TO BRIEFLY MENTION? EFFORTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY IN THE FORM OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY SALMON RECOVERY PROGRAM. IS THE COLLABORATIVE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO TAKING REAL STEPS TO IMPROVE -- SALMON HABITAT FOR ALL LIFE STAGES AND ARE REMEMBERING OUR FLOWS IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY TO PROVIDE OPTIMAL BENEFITS FOR FISH BUT ALSO PROTECTING OUR LOCAL LAGGED ECONOMY AND ENSURING THAT LOCAL A COMMUNITIES HAVE THE WATER THEY NEED. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE FISH HABITAT. UP PROJECTS UP FISH SCREENING OF AGRICULTURAL WATER DIVERSIONS AND AGAIN COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS TO RE MANAGER FLOWS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE'RE PROTECTING OUR ECONOMY PROVIDE ENSURING WE HAVE WATER FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT ALSO ENSURING WITH HELP YOU HEALTHY FISH POPULATIONS WE THINK THAT THAT TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH IS EXACTLY WHAT THE STATE RIGHT NEEDS RIGHT NOW. AS YOU KNOW THERE MANY DISCUSSIONS UNDER WAY ABOUT HOW WE MANAGE OUR RIVERS AND A WATER SYSTEM AS A STATE A WE THINK THAT LOOKING BEYOND FLOW TO THESE OTHER TYPES OF PROJECTS. ON AS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF LAW. IS REALLY KEY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION TODAY AND AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT WILL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS BECAUSE THAT WAS EXACTLY THE THOUGHT I HAD ABOUT THAT PROJECT THEIR RIGHTS PROJECT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL THEN THERE MAY BE. OTHER STRATEGIES FOR OUR A RESURGENCE OF THE SALMON POPULATION THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN CONSIDERED IN THAT THE FLOWS ARE NOT THE ONLY ANSWER I GUESS IS MY WATER SUPPLIERS UP AND DOWN THE STATE ON THE LEADING EDGE OF IMPLEMENTING THESE PROGRAMS. PROJECTS MANY MORE PLANNED AN EVEN MORE POSSIBLE AND I THINK THE EXCITING POTENTIAL FOR FLOOD PLAIN -- RECONNECTING FLOOD PLAINS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY CLAIBORNE WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IN WITH YOUR INDULGENCE CHAIR WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SET FOR PUBLIC HONOR. AS LONG AS YOU DON'T GET TOO COMFORTABLE. I'LL TRY TO BE AS BRIEF AS I CAN -- SO I WANT TO START BY SAYING WELL FIRST OF ALL MY NAME'S MIKE CLAIBORNE ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I REPRESENT -- RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND EAST COACHELLA VALLEY. I DON'T WANNA START MY COMMENT BY SAYING THAT WE SUPPORT AG LAND CONVERSION AND SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE DISCUSSED TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY -- AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY CONSERVATION OF AG LAND AS OPPOSED AG LAND CONVERSION TO URBAN LAND USES DISCOURAGES URBAN SPRAWL -- THAT INCREASES GHG EMISSIONS VEHICLES MILES TRAVELED AND LOCAL AIR QUALITY IMPACTS -- WE WORKED ON REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANS THROUGHOUT THE FOR THE LAST HOUR WHAT FIVE DEAD. SEVEN YEARS THAT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AS IT EXISTED. AND WE SEE THIS AS A REAL -- OPPORTUNITY TO COLLABORATE BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TO MAKE SURE NOT CONVERTING -- ATLANTA NECESSARILY AND INSTEAD ENCOURAGING -- URBAN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S DANCE AND CENTERED AROUND. TOWN CENTERS AND ALSO FOCUSED ON TRANSIT AND ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION RATHER THAN ROAD EXPANSION -- SO IF WE SEE THAT AS A ROOM FOR COLLABORATION -- WE ALSO WANTED TO THINK -- MANY OF WITH WHOM WERE HERE EARLIER TODAY -- BUT THOSE WHO AND WITHIN AGRICULTURE THAT SUPPORTED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ACT -- WHICH WE SEE AS ESSENTIAL -- TO SOLVING THE DRINKING WATER CRISIS THAT'S AFFECTING THE STATE. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- WITH THAT SAID I THINK THERE'S A FEW THINGS THAT ARE MISSING FROM TODAY'S HEARING AND WE ASK FOR I'M A FOLLOW HEARING -- WE'D LIKE TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION OF DEFERRED IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE WITHIN AGRICULTURE -- INCLUDING -- THE ISSUE AREAS OF PESTICIDES DUST WATER QUALITY DEGRADATION AIR QUALITY DEGRADATION -- AND DE TO THE EXTENT THOSE ISSUES ARE RELATED TO AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES -- TO THAT AND THERE ARE SEVERAL POINTS THAT -- WE'D LIKE FOR THE DISCUSSION AROUND -- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT AGRICULTURE ACCOUNTS FOR THE MAJORITY OF METHANE EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. AND THE ED DAIRY INDUSTRY ACCOUNT ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 75% OF THOSE EMISSIONS. WERE CONCERNED WITH THE STATE'S GROWING RELIANCE ON VERY TIGHT JESTERS TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- THE ESPECIALLY TO THE EXTENT THAT RELY ON PUBLIC SUBSIDIES -- WE SEE THAT THIS IS A FAIRLY ON PROVEN METHOD -- TO RESPONSE TO METHANE EMISSIONS FROM THE DAIRY INDUSTRY -- AND THEY DID NOT ADDRESS RELATED AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH RESPECT -- TO THE INDUSTRY. IN FACT PUBLIC SUBSIDIES COULD EXASPERATED AND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM DAIRIES BY INCENTIVIZING INCREASED HER EXCISE. AND POTENTIALLY EXPANDING AN INDUSTRY THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE CURRENTLY OF AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY POLLUTION IN THE STATE -- WITH RESPECT TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY THE CLAIM THAT BY A METHANE DISCOURAGES THE USE OF DIESEL AND TRANSPORTATION. ARE WE KNOW THAT -- MOST AT THAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON GENERATION OF BIO METHANE. AND AT ADDING THAT BY MATH AND AND THINGS [inaudible] PIPELINES SO IT'S NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON TRANSPORTATION RELATED IMPACTS ARE AS OF YET -- SO WE THINK THAT THOSE CLAIMS SHOULD BE REVIEWED CRITICALLY -- AND THAT THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT UNKNOWNS REGARDING IMPACTS OF TERRY DI JESTERS WHICH WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THIS. COMMITTEE AND I AND OTHERS IN THE INDUSTRY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND -- HOW TO MITIGATE ANYTHING RELATED TO THEIR DIGESTERS? WITH RESPECT IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE WE'D KNOW THAT AND THE TWENTY TWELVE STUDY PREPARED BY UC DAVIS WHICH WERE ALL FAMILIAR WITH LIKELY -- ONE THIRD OF DOMESTIC WELLS IN THE TULARE LAKE BASIN IN THE SALINAS VALLEY EXCEEDED THE NITRATE MCO FOR DRINKING WATER. AND THAT SAME SET A STUDY CONCLUDED THAT 96% OF HUMAN GENERATED NITRATE IS SOURCED IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND DAIRIES. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT RIGHT CURRENT REGULATION HASN'T SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED. AND WE SEE. ROOM FOR BETTER REGULATION AND LEGISLATIVE SOLUTIONS -- ADDITIONALLY THERE'S THE NITROUS OXIDE STUDY THAT WAS -- COMPLETED THIS YEAR SHOWING AGRICULTURE CONTRIBUTES BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND 40% OF TOTAL KNOCKS EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY ADDRESSED -- AT LEAST NOT THE POINT IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED -- AND JUST TO CLOSE AGRICULTURE AND STATE POLICYMAKERS CAN AND MUST DO MORE TO PROTECT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FROM AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY POLLUTION. WE CALL FOR LEGISLATION AND REGULATORY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMING YEARS TO ADDRESS THESE IMPACTS CEMENTED MANDATE IMPROVE PRACTICES. I WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY SUFFERING FOR MANY OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT I DISCUSSED TODAY AIR QUALITY IMPACTS WATER QUALITY THAT -- IS NOT FIT TO DRINK -- AS I JUST THINK THAT WE CAN ALL WORKED VERY. HARD TOGETHER TO BETTER MITIGATING AVOID NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN THE FUTURE. ESPECIALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WITH IN THE SAN JOAQUIN IS COACHELLA VALLEY'S AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THANK YOU AND I'D BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS ANY OF THESE POINTS FURTHER BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING THANKS THANK YOUTHANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS HERE TODAY AND THE NAY TREATS ISSUES. HE IT'S HISTORIES BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING SO THAT SAID THAT'S A LEGACY ISSUE THAT THAT WE'VE GOT TO WORK WITH WE HAVE TO WORK ON AND NO QUESTION IT'S SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUE -- FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR COMMENTS -- AND AND DUMB AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE SO I REALLY THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNFORTUNATELY THIS COMMITTEE HAS NO JURISDICTION OVER PESTICIDES. GO FIGURE -- BUT UP BUT IT'S IT'S OUT ORTON OR NORM OUR WATER QUALITY BELIEVE IT OR NOT BUT NAM THOSE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES IN RURAL CALIFORNIA AND I'M I'M WITH YOU HAD A PERCENT THERE ARE THINGS WE NEED TO DO THAT -- MILLION AMELIORATED MEDICAID -- THOSE AND HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE. TAKE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THERE AND ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THERE'S ROOM TO WORK TOGETHER ON CONVERSION ARE I MEAN. PREVENTING CONVERSION OF ACT YES YES I AGREE WITH THE THANK YOU SO MUCH WITH THAT DIE IF THERE ARE NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS. UP WANTED THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE UP REALLY AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING THE PURPOSE REALLY WAS TO TO START HAVING THIS DIALOGUE ABOUT -- THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE -- TO USE AND AT UTILIZE ALL OF OUR RESOURCES IN THE STATE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS -- AND TO SEQUESTER AS MUCH AS WE CAN AND SO THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN IN IN THAT DIRECTION SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S BEEN VERY. VERY VERY HELPFUL APPRECIATED. AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE FOR TODAY
