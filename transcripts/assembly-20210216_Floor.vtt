RIGHT TO DO SO. WE ALSO OBSERVE

00:48:40.484 --> 00:48:42.052
THAT THE EFFORT TO CENTRALIZE

ALLEGATION THAT VOTER FRAUD IS

00:50:48.278 --> 00:50:49.646
A REASON WHY WE SHOULD NOT DO

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.299
THESE STATISTICS ARE SHAMEFUL

01:02:50.366 --> 01:02:53.336
AND INTERCONNECTED. YET DESPITE

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:57.440

01:03:09.218 --> 01:03:12.755
MAN. HOW DO WE KNOW THIS WELL

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.524

THAT WAS USED IN SUGAR

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:20.930
PRODUCTION. THE REASON THE

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:24.600
PATENT FILE NOTES HIS RACE IS

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.201
BECAUSE SOMEONE TRIED TO TAKE

01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:26.903
IT FROM HIM. BECAUSE HE WAS

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:30.406
BLACK. OVER SEVEN HUNDRED

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.108
PATENTS WERE FILED BY BLACK

01:03:32.175 --> 01:03:35.478

ALL KINDS OF THINGS THE

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:43.853
ELEVATOR. ROTARY ENGINES A

DISTRIBUTOR AND THE PRECURSOR

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:52.628
TO THE GAS MASK. BUT THERE WERE

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:55.164
DIPS IN THOSE INNOVATIONS. ONE

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:57.600
DAY IT WAS IN NINETEEN HUNDRED

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:59.535
WITH PLESSY V. FERGUSON. THE

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:01.504
SUPREME COURT RULING THAT SAID

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:02.104
BLACK PEOPLE WERE SEPARATE BUT

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.707
EQUAL. SUDDENLY WE WERE KICKED

01:04:04.774 --> 01:04:06.209
OUT OF LIBRARIES COMMERCIAL

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:09.312
DISTRICTS. CUT AWAY FROM

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:11.581
TALKING WITH OTHER INVENTORS.

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:14.050
WE WERE ALSO LYNCHED AND FORCE

01:04:14.116 --> 01:04:15.885
TO DEFEND OUR LIVE IN

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.486
SEGREGATED AMERICA SCOTLAND

01:04:17.553 --> 01:04:21.691
CONCERT. I THINK OF THOSE

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:24.860
HISTORIES. BECAUSE IT HELPS ME

01:04:24.927 --> 01:04:27.363
NAVIGATE THE GIVE AND TAKE OF

01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:29.665
BEING BLACK IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:04:29.732 --> 01:04:30.967
AND SHOULDERING THE BURDEN OF

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.735
DEFENDING AND DEFINING BLACK

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:51.754
YEARS AGO MY HUSBAND WHO'S AN

01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:55.191
ATTORNEY. I WAS DROPPING OFF

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:56.025

WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:13.009
DOING HUMANITARIAN WORK. IN THE

01:05:13.075 --> 01:05:14.543
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS OF WEST

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.613

PRIEST WHO ORGANIZED THE GROUP

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:21.784
PULLED ME TO THE SIDE AND SAID.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:23.653
DON'T BE OFFENDED IF SOMEONE

01:05:23.719 --> 01:05:26.422
CALLED YOU A **** THEY'VE NEVER

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:29.492
SEEN A BLACK PERSON BEFORE. I

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:31.093
NOW THINK OF THE AUDACITY OF

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.695

BACK EDUCATE AND ADDRESS THAT

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:51.714
KIND OF IGNORANCE. TELLING ME

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:55.217
THAT DIDN'T FIX ANYTHING. IT

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:57.420
JUST SHIFTED HIS ACCOUNTABILITY.

01:05:57.486 --> 01:06:02.258
THESE STORIES OLD AND CURRENT

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:04.427

01:51:13.933 --> 01:51:15.935

HAVE RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS THE

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:58.244
REASON APART A LARGE PART OF

01:56:58.311 --> 01:57:00.246
WHY WE HAVE THESE THINGS. JUST

01:57:00.313 --> 01:57:01.881

THERE WILL BE THOSE WHO. SEEK

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:06.746
TO EXPLOIT SOME FACTS OF THESE

01:58:06.813 --> 01:58:09.816

ASIAN AMERICANS TO SAY VERY

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:16.923
VERY NASTY THINGS. AND JUMP TO

01:58:16.989 --> 01:58:17.890
CONCLUSIONS BUT THAT'S ALRIGHT

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.025
IT'S GOT TO COME OUT OF PLACE

01:58:19.091 --> 01:58:21.694

WORSHIP. IT'S FOR THIS REASON

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.042
THAT WE ARE SO DISHEARTENED AND

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:17.877

02:00:17.944 --> 02:00:19.879
VIOLENCE AND THE REALLY UGLY

02:00:19.946 --> 02:00:21.013
BIGOTRY THAT WE ARE WITNESSING

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:22.882
AGAINST THE API COMMUNITY IN

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY.

02:00:24.517 --> 02:00:25.785
I WAS DISCUSSING WITH M

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:26.786
COLLEAGUE FROM CAMPBELL LAST

02:00:26.852 --> 02:00:27.753
WEEK SOME OF THE SIMILARITIES

02:00:27.820 --> 02:00:28.821
ABOUT THE HATE AND

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.022
DISCRIMINATION THAT OUR

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:31.290
COMMUNITIES FACE ABOUT THE FACT

02:00:31.357 --> 02:00:32.925
THAT. THEY COME FROM RECYCLED

02:00:32.992 --> 02:00:34.460
STEREO TYPES FOR BIGOTRY THAT

02:00:34.527 --> 02:00:35.528
HAS REARED ITS HEAD IN THE

02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:37.530
PAST. THAT PLAYS ON THE FEAR OF

02:00:37.597 --> 02:00:39.899
THE OTHER. ABOUT THE VIOLENCE

02:00:39.966 --> 02:00:41.200
THAT'S OFTEN PRECEDED BY

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.902
HATEFUL RHETORIC BY PEOPLE WHO

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:44.437
MAY BE SPEAKING IN CODE. BUT

02:00:44.503 --> 02:00:46.472
THAT CODE IS UNDERSTOOD AND

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:48.941
INSIGHTS ACTION. BY THE FACT

02:00:49.008 --> 02:00:49.675
THAT NO MATTER WHAT OUR

02:00:49.742 --> 02:00:51.143
COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTE NO

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.446
MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY. THIS

02:00:53.512 --> 02:00:54.580
UNDERLYING SENSE THAT MAYBE

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:56.315
WE'RE NOT SURE RECALLS MAYBE

02:00:56.382 --> 02:00:57.717
WE'RE NOT REALLY REALLY WELCOME

02:00:57.783 --> 02:00:59.885
HERE BY EVERYBODY. AND WE KNOW

02:00:59.952 --> 02:01:01.220
AS AS OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THE

02:01:01.287 --> 02:01:02.288
SAN GABRIEL VALLEY SAID THAT

02:01:02.355 --> 02:01:04.090
HATE CRIMES DON'T JUST IMPACT

02:01:04.156 --> 02:01:06.225
INDIVIDUAL VICTIMS. THAT THEY

02:01:06.292 --> 02:01:07.660
THEY HAVE A BROADER IMPACT ON

02:01:07.727 --> 02:01:09.795
THE TARGETED COMMUNITY ON OTHER

02:01:09.862 --> 02:01:11.130
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FOLKS

02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.732
THAT FEEL HATE AND ULTIMATELY

02:01:12.798 --> 02:01:14.166
ON THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.067
THAT IS OUR CLOCKS AND THEY ARE

02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:16.669
MEANT TO DIVIDE US AND THAT IS

02:01:16.736 --> 02:01:20.373
WHY ALLY SHIP AND PARTNERSHIP

02:01:20.439 --> 02:01:21.607
ARE SO ESSENTIAL HERE. I WOULD

02:01:21.674 --> 02:01:22.942

THE MOST MEANINGFUL MOMENTS FOR

02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:27.213
