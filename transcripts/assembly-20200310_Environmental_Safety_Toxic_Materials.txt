MADAM CHAIR MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE LOUIS BROWN ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA CITY MUTUAL CAL FRESH FOR ASSOCIATE WESTERN HEALTH A COUPLE OTHER UP GROUPS OF FIRST UP LIKE. THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS I'M IN APPRECIATION TO THE VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS UP PUT TOGETHER BY STAFF OUTLINING THE HISTORY OF THIS ISSUE- AND THE ELEMENTS THE LAW. AND ALSO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WARNING OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. CANNOT ARGUE WITH ANY OF THE COMMENTS OF THE AUTHOR I WHEN IT COMES TO WANTING STRICT ENFORCEMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATIONS. AFTER BAD ACTORS. WE DO AGREE WITH ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT IN THE ANALYSIS AND WOULD LIKE TO JUST SEE A MINOR TWEAKING THE SUBSTANCE PORTION OF THE LANGUAGE. BILLION WITH A MORE OPEN DIALOGUE INCOME BETWEEN THE AG. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF A PESTICIDE REGULATIONS PRIOR TO- THE DIRECTOR A SUIT IN OTHER TORTILLA I NECESSARY AND WE THINK WE'RE CLOSE IN THAT. IT'S A REAL EASY FIX OUR THE BILL HAS COME IS THE- HOT THE FINES AND THE ENFORCEMENT GOING FROM HOUSE TO TWENTY BUT- BE THERE FOR ON OUR INTERPRETATION OF. A LOT OF THESE INCIDENTS PLACER. ARE NOT. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN APPLICATION THESE ARE. NOT AN EXCUSE FOR THE VIOLATION BUT DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT RAISES A CONCERN FOR US IF IT WERE TO GO FROM A POTENTIAL FIVE THOUSAND VERSUS A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE WHAT HAS OP. POTENTIAL BE STACKED UP IT'S PER BELLY WHICH- INDEED YOU KNOW OTHER ELEMENTS ARE WITHIN THE PRIORITY INCIDENT MEMO WITH THE AG COMMISSIONERS ANOTHER SOAP WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A TRIMS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY UNDER THE CURRENT THE THOUGHT OF FOR THESE MINDSET TOO WE PRO. AND BE QUITE EXCESSIVE ON IN. WE ALSO HAVE JUST TO A LARGER CONCERN IN THAT. THE AMOUNT OF TOOLS IN THE NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE I IN THE STATE OR A STRING LIMITED. A WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME ACCESS TO TOOLS THAT OTHER FARMERS WITHIN THE COUNTRY HAVE HI WHILE WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION- THAT ROBUSTNESS IN THOSE RULES REALLY RESTRICT WHAT PRODUCTS INCOME TO OF THE MARKET. THAT NUMBER OF BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS UNDER NUMBER GREENER PRODUCTS QUOTE UNQUOTE SAFETY- SAFER PRODUCTS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN ALL OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTRY THAT ARE NOT BEING UTILIZED. BECAUSE ADDITION. BRING THE MARKET AND THE TIMELINESS TO BRING PRODUCTS TO THE MARKET. AND SO WITHOUT THOSE OTHER AVAILABLE TOOLS WE DO SEE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WHEN A MISTAKE HAPPENS WHEN AN INCIDENT OCCURS THAT THEY COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SEVERE. BECAUSE SOME CHEMISTRIES THAT WE HAVE AND USE HERE- IN THE STATE SO WE THINK AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. IN A MORE IN THIS ISSUE IN GREATER DETAIL. HOW WE KNOW THAT OUR SOME. GROUPS ARE IN WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE RIGHT. IN THEIR CURRENT PRACTICES. HOW WE THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED UPON AND WE NEED TO BE ENCOURAGING THE DEPARTMENT AND OTHERS TO BRING THESE OTHER PRODUCTS TO MARKET- SO THAT WE REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THIS INCIDENTS ACROSS THE BOARD. THAT LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU. AND FOR THE PER THOSE PURPOSES WE ARE OPPOSING AMENDED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIX WITNESSES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW CYBERLINK BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS AND SEALERS ASSOCIATION. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT APPEARS IN PRINT TODAY BUT I JUST I HAVE TO. OF COURSE LIKE LIKE LOUIS IN AND THE AUTHOR OF A FIRST THE COMMITTEE STAFF I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF. FOR CONSISTENTLY CONSTANTLY REACHING OUT TO US TO TRY TO GET FEEDBACK TO TRY TO. GET THIS IN NOW WITH THE POSITIONS BUT WE DID THAT PRIOR TO THIS TEAM DURING. THE IN A NUT SHELL HE- FOR THE ARTICLE TO TAKE OVER AND INVESTIGATE. OR AYE AYE AND IT. ACTION WITHIN THE WOULD LIKE THAT TO SEE. TO THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE- COOPERATIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE- OF A JOINT DECISION MADE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE AYE COMMISSION I THINK. VERY CLOSE. WITH DROPS OF A FLOATING. TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE TO FIND THOSE WORDS THAT THAT WORK IN BECAUSE WORDS MATTER. WHEN YOU PLACE THE LAW- SECONDLY WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONVERSATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT. I JUST MAKE BUT WE UNDERSTAND THE FLOW CHART NAY INTERVIEW AND HOW AND HOW THAT THE WHOLE PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. I'M GONNA BE COMMUNICATING WANT TO SORT OF KNOW WITHOUT. THIS IS GONNA BE A NEW. A NEW PROCESS. WORK THROUGH. AND IN LASTLY I DID BRING UP AWAY. TODAY ANY TYPE OF QUESTIONS. THE CURRENT. UP PROCESS AND IF YOU COULD INTRODUCE MYSELF AND IT'S BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS IF YOU DO HAVE ANY AYE. I'M STEVE SURE YUBA COUNTY AG COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW M. ANYMORE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME FORWARD THANK YOU YES A GOOD AFTERNOON MATTHEW OUT WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION WE WOULD ALIGN OUR COMMENTS MADE BY MISTER BROWN ALSO OPPOSE UNLESS EMITTED. GOOD AFTERNOON TAYLOR OCEAN OF THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU ERE ALSO POSED WITH MENDED THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AT THREE MILLION ON BEHALF OF THE ALLMAN ALLIANCE CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA. ASSOCIATION OF THE CALIFORNIA C. DISSOCIATION OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. OKAY THAT RIGHT SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WILL BRING IT UP HERE TO THE DIE IS MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THE TERMINAL. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO- I THINK WE'RE ALL UNITED IN OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT- PESTICIDES APPROPRIATELY REGULATED IN CALIFORNIA A COUPLE CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL THE FIRST IS THE SIZE OF THE PENALTY INCREASE WHEN YOU MAKE A GOOD POINT THAT THE PENALTY ADOPTED INCREASE YEARS IF YOU APPLY THE AYE. TING PENALTY TO NEAR WHAT INCREASE. IT DOES COLBERT ABOUT WHAT IT'S A PROP TO ONCE A INCREASE THIS PEDAL BY FIVE TIMES. YES I TO WAKE POINT ALSO ON AMMO SAID EARLIER RELATED TO THE FINE SO WANNA BE CLEAR IT'S UP TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR THERE'S JUST. IN THAT BY ALL MEANS I. IT IS OFTEN NOT THE CASE THAT. MAXIMUM FOR. I'M SPEAK CONSULTORES BY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR UNDER UNDER THE STATUTE IT IS NOT MANDATED- BUT IT'S- AT A COUPLE THINGS ONE IS YES IT'S A FIVE FOLD INCREASE IN HERE'S WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST IT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS. WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE BECAUSE OF IT A LONG TIME BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M YOU COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE. COME THE SAME. I'M WE INTO THIS NUMBER IN PART BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT OTHER SECTIONS OF. IT'S KIND OF REGULATORY CODE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS SIMILAR TO THOSE IT'S LOWER THAN A LOT OF OTHERS AS- NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS AND IT SEEMS LIKE THE- BREAD. A MAXIMUM PENALTY TO SURE WE HAVE THE TOOLS TO PREVENT THESE. INCIDENTS WHEN THERE ARE PRAIRIE INCIDENT SO AGAIN ONLY FOCUSED ON THE ROAD THE INCIDENTS ARE CAUSING. AB HAVE BLURRED TOOLBOX. BY THE LAW. OKAY THANK YOU IN MY SECOND CONCERN. REGARDS THE APPEARANCE SO WHERE YOU'RE SURFING LOCAL CONTROL HERE AND I KNOW I SERVED IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT I KNOW MANY OF US DID- I ALWAYS KIND OF RESENTED IT WHEN THE STATE CAME IN AND TOLD ME THAT I WE WERE DOING. OF THE STATE WAS GONNA COME WILL TAKE CONTROL AND I'M WONDERING THOUGH IS THAT WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE FOR THE LOCAL AGENT AREN'T DOING ENOUGH. HELLO THESE THESE ABUSES PASSED ASIDE USE. OR IT A NO IT'S SEEMS. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE IS THE OVERRIDING REASON WHY. DPR NEEDS TO COME AND TAKE THIS AUTHORITY. YES SO LET'S. NOT TAKING IT AND I AM THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE AND IN IN MANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ACT. THERE ISN'T VERY CLOSE TO THEM. BUT YOU KNOW TIME IT I MEAN WE DIDN'T GET TO THE LANGUAGE BUT I. THINK I'M ALSO CONFIDENT WE'LL GET BASE WHERE THE COUNTRY. SO I KNOW MEANS. AWAY FROM THEM. I MEAN THAT'S THE GOAL. THEY WOULD BE THIS CLUSTER. OFF I BELIEVE IF WE WERE. BUT YOU CAN SPEAK FOR ITSELF AND BUT I THINK THAT THAT THE NASA SAYS HE DOES COMES IN A COUPLE WAYS WHAT IS. SOMETIMES WE HAVE GROUP. SECTION BUT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH A SPRAY. AND IN THOSE CASES MAKING SURE THAT IS AN AUTHORITY THAT CAN DO IT. MAKES SENSE BUT ALSO WHERE THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS. ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON CONFLICTED OUT OR OTHERWISE IF THEY'RE NOT. APPROPRIATE AND HEATED DUET THIS GIVES. DEEP TO DO IT IN LIEU OF THAT BUT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE ARE CLOSE TO ADDING. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE IT THERE SO I CAN'T GIVE YOU EXACT LANGUAGE BUT- RELATES THIS KIND OF COLLABORATION AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE LOCAL AUTHORITY AND IF YOU ARE THAT THEY ARE THE APPROPRIATE. ENTITY TO DO IT. LOOKING TO. AS WE MOVE FORWARD OKAY BUT THAT'S A REALLY. IMPORTANT YEAH I THINK. BECAUSE IF THE PR IS GONNA TAKE OVER AN INVESTIGATION. I THINK IT THAT HAS TO BE THE REASON. YEAH THAT THAT BECAUSE IT'S MULTI JURISDICTIONAL. BUT THEY'RE THE MOST. CREATION AND THAT I THINK WOULD REQUIRE. ROB OF THE AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS. ON A LOCAL LEVEL SO. I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT- I'LL BE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL TODAY BUT- THAT COULD CHANGE. IF AND WHEN YOU TAKE THAT AND WHICH BECAUSE IT'S REAL IMPORTANT ME. THANK YOU. I THINK THIS ONE I THINK THE- OTHER FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE BEEN. TRYING TO FIX THIS FOR A WHILE WE HAVE A HISTORY HERE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I'M ADDING CURRENT THE OPPOSITION STATE TABLE THE COMMITTEE HAS WORKED HARD AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL. I'M WITH THAT I WANT TO MAKE. SEC. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. NO OKAY SO THIS BILL IS- IDENTICAL TO THE BILL THAT CAME TWO YEARS AGO BY OUR CHAIRMAN- WHICH FAILED ON THE FLOOR. AND LIKELY WILL FAIL BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY BY MY COLLEAGUES THE LARGE INCREASE IN THE FINE THE TAKING AWAY LOCAL CONTROL BE CONCERNED THAT DOWN THE STATE MIGHT COME STEP% IN WHERE HER. CLOTHES DECIDE NO ACTION IS WARM AND IN THE STATE DECIDES TO COMMAND AND SAID NOW WE THINK ACTION IS WARRANTED NOT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE GIVES. GREAT BURNING TURN ON SO THAT BEING AND I HOPE THAT ALONG THE WAY. ALL CAN COME TO SORT OF REMEMBER CENTER THIS BILL SAY IN THE POINT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE VERY SAME MANIC FOR A LOT TIME. I HAVE A LOT. I AM BUT THE END RESULT OF THIS BILL WOULD BE EXACTLY THAT TIME WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M I'M WITH YEAH. AS FAR AS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE HARMED BY PASSED FINDS BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DONE IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T ALSO HARM THE INDUSTRY SO. ON THERE'S MOTION SIR. I'M SICK. THIS IS ITEM ONE AB NINETEEN NINETEEN. BAUER-KAHAN THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. MELENDEZ NOW. MELENDEZ NO CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA I HOLDEN HOLDEN I. MATHIS WHAT A TO G. MURATSUCHI HI OBERNOLTE OBERNOLTE NO KALRA KALRA HI. FIVE TWO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT BILL IS OUT- THE FINAL BILL WE HAVE ON THE AGENDA TODAY IS ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. TWO ZERO SIX ZERO BY ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN WELCOME ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDING MOVE THE BILL. THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR TO MOVE THE BILL. **** IT ALL RIGHT THERE IN THE SECOND THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR HOLDEN PERCEIVE WHEN YOU'RE READY. BECAUSE OF THE SERVER BODE WELL MEDIC HERE THANK YOU AND MEMBERS- I LOOK FORWARD TO REBEL RESPONSE ON AB TWENTY SIXTY CURRENT LAW ESTABLISHES A CONTENT STANDARD OF POINT TWO FIVE LET PERCENT LEAD FOR PLUMBING FIXTURES TO APPLY WITH THE LEAD PRETTY STANDARD. LAST YEAR IN A INTERNET IT'LL TESTED FIVE HUNDRED FAUCETS THAT MET THE CALIFORNIA LEAD CONTENT STANDARD AND FOUND THE 25% OF THE FAUCETS TESTED LEACH NOTICE NOTICEABLY. AMOUNTS OF LET. AB TWENTY SIXTY WOULD ESTABLISH A LEAD LEACHING PERFORMANCE STANDARD TO COMPLY AS LEAD FREE IT WOULD REQUIRE IN USE FIXTURES TO LEAD TO LESS THAN ONE MILLIGRAM LEADER LEADER LET. WE ALL EXPECT THE WATER WE DRINK WILL BE CAP. WILL KEEP US HEALTHY AND NOT MAKE A SICK HELLO IT HAS BEEN WORKING TO REDUCE RESIDENTS EXPOSURE TO LEAD YET LET IS STILL LIBERTINE AND OR DRINKING WATER THROUGH FAUCETS AND FIXTURES REQUIRE ALL FAUCETS AND FIXTURES. LEECHES LITTLE LEAD AS POSSIBLE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M JOINED HERE AS- WITH MY WITNESSES TODAY TOM NET MILLER MILLER. CHEMICAL POLICY YEAH YES ALL RIGHT. WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER SO LONG CHEMICAL POLICY DIRECTOR OF ANIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND SUSAN LITTLE SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. I APPRECIATE THIS TIME DOLLAR WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR PRESENTING AVAIL- WE RISE IN SUPPORT OF IT. UP I'VE WORKED ON LEAD POISONING PREVENTION FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT DRINKING WATER FOR THE PAST SIX AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THEY HAVE WORKED WITH THE NSF INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE THE NATIONAL SANITATION FOUNDATION COMMITTEE. THAT HANDLES THE- THE STANDARD THAT'S LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF LET BE LEACHED ERA CAN LAMBERT OF LEAD TO COMPETE IN DEFAULT IT'S AN BE LEAKED OUT. I NEED TWO YEAR AND TRYING AGAIN FOR THIRD. THE TITANS STANDARDS AND THIS YEAR THERE IS A CONSENSUS AROUND MOVING FORWARD WITH THE MANDATORY STANDARDS AND I'M SURE YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT. SAYS MOVING TO SETS LIMITS AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT TO FOLLOW THROUGH BECAUSE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE. WE START THIS TAP GROUP AND THEN IT TO GO TO A COMMITTEE AND THEN IT GOES PROPOSED PROCESS. THE THREE. HELPS TO. ASSIST HAPPENS. CAN. THANK MY NAME IS SUSAN LITTLE I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND THEY'RE BERMAN WORKING GROUP WAS THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY WITH ALSO AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLYMAN HOLDEN SEVERAL YEARS AGO REQUIRES CHILD CARE CENTERS TO TEST THE KING WILL FOR LEAD AND AS AFTER THAT BILL WAS ENACTED WE HAVE BEEN SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICE. AND THE WATER. IMPLEMENTING THAT BILL. FOR WHICH THAT THE TESTING IS ALREADY BEGINNING- IN IN THE COURSE OF DEVELOPING- HELPING WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND WITH THE BOARD ON DEVELOPING THE GUIDELINES OF THE DIRECTIVES FROM THIS PROGRAM- WE COME CAME ACROSS THIS CUT. DRUM DEALING WITH SETS WERE IF THE CHILD CARE CENTERS. A MANY OF WHICH ARE IN PRE OR AN OLDER BUILDINGS. DISCOVER THAT FOSTER. DOUBLE DECKERS HI MENTAL BUT IN THERE WHAT. STE GO TO YOU FOR. XIN WILL BE THE TO REMOVE. WHICH FAUCET. FIND BUT DESPITE. WORKING WITH THE ENVIRONMENT FUND. THAT IT'S ACTUALLY POP THAT THE REPLACE FOR THAT THEY WOULD PURCHASE AND THEN INSTALL COULD ACTUALLY LEACH RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS MORE LEAD. THAN THE FAUCET THAT THEY WOULD BE SWITCHING OUT. AND SO- IN AND OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO HELP THE CENTERS AND SCHOOLS WERE ALSO FACING THE THING CONUNDRUM. IDENTIFIED THEM FAUCETS THAT LEAD THE LEAGUE LEACH LEAST OF LEAD WE- STARTED DISINVEST CAME A WHAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENED HOW ARE THESE FAUCETS WE KNOW THEY'RE BETTER PERFORMING FAUCETS OUT THERE HOW CAN WE IDENTIFY THOSE AND FOUND THAT THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO DO THAT WE CAN'T IDENTIFY. CONSUMER THEY ARE USUALLY. WHICH ARE THE BEST FORMING. WE KNOW QUITE IF. NOT TO IT'S A WHICH THIS VERY LOW AMOUNT LEAD AND SO THAT THE GENESIS OF THIS BILL AND- WE FOR WE- ARE VERY PLEASED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOLDEN WANTED TO ENTERED WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL. AND WE ANTICIPATE ENACTMENT OF THE BILL WILL NOT ONLY HELP THE CHILD CARE CENTERS ENSURE THAT THEIR DRINKING WATER.

AFTERNOON JERRY DOESN'T I'M REPRESENTING PLUMBING MANUFACTURES INTERNATIONAL OR PMI HAVE ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENT COMPANIES ACROSS THE NATION THE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF A PUTTING PRODUCTS SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DIFFERENT NAME BRAND. A AS WELL WITH THE OFFER IS THE BOTTOM OF OPPOSITE. THAT THE TO BEGIN WITH APPRECIATE BUT THE SEVEN MEMBER HOLDEN AND THE SPONSORS AND SUPPORTERS ARE CAPTION WITH AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTEEN IMPLEMENTATION THERE. AND THE GOAL OF PROVIDING SAFE DRINKING WATER SCHOOLS AND CHILDCARE CENTERS IN A WE EMBRACE AND SUPPORT COMPLETELY EFFECT PM I IN THE MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED SINCE THE DIPLOMAT CHEN OF THE NINETEEN FIFTIES. THAT A STEP BY STEP LEVELS FOR FAUCETS BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND WE WERE COMMENT THAT IT'S THAT A TO GET PRODUCTS OUT OF. PLACE TO WE'VE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SUMMER HOLDEN IN HIS OFFICE IN THE- SPONSORS AND ORDER. TO OF THE TO READ THE DIALOGUE FORD IF I COULD TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE ISSUES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE THE WILL COME BEFORE THE LARGEST. WE YOU KNOW PRODUCTIVE PERCEPTIONS AND WERE CONSCIOUS OF THE SLICK AND VICIOUS YOU KNOW THAT THAT WILL OCCUR. AND THE FIRST THE BILL AS OF INTENT. THIS IS MORE THAN JUST CARE CENTERS. AT THE PLOT PRODUCTS INTENT. CAPTION THROB STATE THE TO BRING IN THE THEM OF GETTING THEM CERTIFIED AND BRING THEM TO MARKET IT TAKES ALL TIME AND A FIGHT REFER BABY NINETEEN FIFTY THREE BY FORMER CHAD IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE WAS A THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE TOUR FOR THIS BILL EVER SO BRING IT IN THOSE KINDS OF CONVERSATION. DOVE TAIL AND A SET THE SUIT WITH IF YOU VALUE ONE AT THE FED. TALKING ABOUT IT JANUARY ON TWENTY TWENTY FOUR PUT. SETH IS COME INTO THE CONVERSATION AS ONE OF THE SORT OF FIRES AND A COUPLE. OF THE FIRST CASE ABOUT THE TAKES RECERTIFY YOUR PRODUCTS AT THE FAMILY PRODUCTS TO LOOK AT HOW MANY THE THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND FAUCETS THAT ARE ON THE- IN THE MARKET TODAY AND THEN TO BRING UP INTO. A SUCCESSFUL FOR. YOU REALLY HOW SAFE WATER YOU DON'T GET THE RESULTS THAT ARE FINDING IS REPLACED. UP SECOND IS WE LOOK AT THE AFTER AND THE IMMEDIATE DILEMMA THAT IS US WE'RE TRYING TO SEE WHAT DO YOU WITH THE- BOSS SUPPORTERS TO A THAT. THEY SHOULD. AT THE TABLE THAT THE ANA SUBTESTS GROUP ARE PARTICIPATING CAN WE MOVE THAT ISSUE FORWARD FOR QUICKER ADOPTION OF AN ASSET SIXTY ONE THE QUEUE VALUE ONE. SO THAT'LL DRIVE THE COMPETITIVE MARKET AND OUR MEMBERS ARE COMPETITORS TO TRY TO PROVIDE THAT PRODUCT BUT IT'S A CERTIFIED PRODUCT. SO IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN GET TO THAT GOAL. A THAT. IT'S THE IT'S A PRODUCTS EVER COMMITTED TO WORKING. FOR THE BILL AND TO ENGAGE IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE OFF TO A GOOD START AND WE'RE- AT THE- OKAY VERY MUCH ANYWAY ELSE IS A TWEENER OR IN OPPOSITE. NOW OKAY OVER HERE TO THE DIS MEMBERS ANYONE BECAUSE DOCTOR EMILY REFERS. TO GO. I WANTED TO MAKE SURE I GOT THAT FIGURE RIGHT DID YOU SAY THAT TWO THIRDS OF THE REPLACEMENT FAUCETS HAVE LED IN THEM NOW. TWO THIRDS OF THEM NOW WOULD PASS THE TEST IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING. TWO THIRDS OF THE BOSSES OUT THERE NOW ARE FINE AND- WITHIN REGULATION AND THE REPLACEMENT ONES THAT YOU WERE MENTIONING THAT ALSO WERE. HAVING LET. WHAT WAS THAT PERCENTAGE. TO BE CLEAR THAT. WE DON'T KNOW YET HOW MANY REPLACEMENT FAUCETS WILL BEING HOW MAY CHILD CARE CENTERS WE NEED TO REPLACE THEIR FAUCET SCHOOLS TO DATE HAVE ABOUT 18% OF THE FOSTER TESTED AT SCHOOLS HAVE HAD TO BE REPLACED- SOME SPECULATION THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT AM ARM NUMBER FOR CHILD CARE. I DON'T KNOW THAT. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS ON BASED NSF TASTE TESTING. THAT APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED WELL UPDATED IT TESTING THEY TESTED ABOUT APPROXIMATE FIVE HUNDRED FAUCETS. FOR THEIR LEACHING VALUE AND FOUND THAT 73% OF THE TO THOSE TESTS SHOWED THAT THE FAUCETS. HAD ON THE- BEACH THE LEAST AMOUNT UNDER THE- UNDER THE ONE MICROGRAM. PER LITER OF LEAD WHICH IS THE KEY WHAT ONE WHICH- TECHNICAL I KNOW BUT- AND BASED ON THE STING. WE PROJECT AT ABOUT 252725% OF THE FAUCETS ON THE MARKET TODAY EVEN THOUGH THEY MEET THE CONTENT STANDARD FOR LAD THAT IS YOU KNOW THE METAL STATE. THEY'RE PERFECT AND HEARD THE MOUNT THAT THE LEECH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE IT'S MORE THAN- THE QUEUE OF ONE AND IN SOME CASES MUCH HIGHER AND TOM WHO HAS. GREAT HAS STUDY THOSE THOSE TESTS COULD PROBABLY EXPLAIN THAT MORE. WELL I THINK MY POINT IS I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE TODAY AND I THINK THIS IS A ANOTHER POSITIVE STEP FORWARD THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF LEAD THAT SAFE FOR CHILDREN. AND SO WHY ARE THESE FAUCET IN THE MARKET. IF THEY HAVE A NUMBER WHICH IS HIGHER AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHY IS A QUARTER OF THE MARKET STILL. LEACHING LEAD AT A LEVEL THAT'S DETECTABLE WHEN THERE'S NO STATE FROM FOR KIDS. AND SO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO REALLY DIG INTO AND FIGURE OUT AND MAYBE YEAH MY APPROPRIATE PLACE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION BUT- FELT LIKE IT WAS A POOR. BUT THE DIAL SURE SURE. BUT THERE. THERE MIGHT BE SOME IN TERMS OF THE STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED AND OVER ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION WITH NSF AND THE STUFF OF WHICH THEY WERE HERE AT THE TABLE AS THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY SORT OF OUR WHAT- I'M- PLAYING IT I THINK A RECESSION WAS THAT WHEN YOU Q. VALUE ONE IT'S THERE'S A RANGE THAT'S THE TO THERE'S ONLY. FIGHT TO SO IT'S NOT THAT MARKETED. YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT MARKETED AT THAT LEVEL BUT IT'S WHAT THEY THOUGHT THEY FOUND. IN THE TESTING THAT OF DEAD BUT THEY SAID IT'S BEING TAKEN OUT OF CONTEXT TO SAY THAT THERE'S THAT MUCH COMPLY THAT THERE'S THAT PERCENTAGE OF INDUSTRY COMPLY. THE SECOND IS THERE IS ACT. I THINK IT'S A PLUMBING BUT SECTIONS. FORTY ONE OF TITLE TWENTY FOUR THE ACTUALLY PUTS THE CURRENT AND A SUB STANDARD IN THERE AND THEN. WE TO WE'RE LOOKING AT LEACH RATE SUPPOSED CON. SO THEY'RE DIFFERENT MEASURE OF. PLACE WE- BUT WITH SO. WHAT UP THERE SHOULD BE SAFE IF NOT SO FOR THE- WE HAVE TO DO SOME ABOUT IT THE- YOU KNOW WE DO WE NOT WE DO NOT A- THAT. IF YOU WERE TO REPLACE A FAULT IN THIS TODAY THAT YOU CAN GET A HIGHER LEVEL THAN A TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD FAUCET. NO JUST LOOK AT THAT THE I THINK IT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE ONE SIXTY NEED SEVENTY FIVE STATUS IN TWO THOUSAND SIX. DODGE IS A MAXIMUM. OF FOUR MORE FOR THE MAXIM LEAD CONTENT IN ANY FAUCET. SO THE NEW FALL TO THE UP LEACH. THE LITTLE FAUCET IS NOT A TITLE. DURATION. OKAY MIKE. I COULD ADD THAT. WITH WE DID TESTING IN CHILDCARE CENTERS. AND WE FOUND THAT INDEED SOME OF THEM WE ACTUALLY HAD MEMBERS THAT WENT OFF THAT WAY HI AFTER WE REPLACE THE FAUCET. MOST OF THE BOSSES WERE IN GOOD SHAPE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO IDENTIFY THE THAT PERFORM WELL VERSUS ONES THAT. HELLO I ACTUALLY LIKE TO TUNNEL DOWN ON SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR ROOM YOU'LL JUST JUST MENTIONED AND THAT'S THE YOU KNOW THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR LEAD IN WATER BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT I THINK WE'RE UNIFIED OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT CHILDREN ARE HARMED BUT IT'S ALSO. COMPLETELY WRONG SAY THAT ANYTHING COULD BE LEAD FREE FROM A LOCAL STANDPOINT OTHERS LET AT. THINGS WILL LEAD MY CAN CAUGHT BUDGET A VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN A WEEK WE ENFORCE STANDARDS THAT SAY THAT NO HERE PART OF. FARM FULL KNOWN TO OUR FOR. WE DON'T. ANY MORE THAN YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT'S NOT HARMFUL SO. MY QUESTION IS THEN. YOU KNOW THE CURRENT NATIONAL STANDARD IS ONE IS FIVE MICROGRAMS PER LITER. AND I WOULD LOOK FOR SOME PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH THAT SAYS THAT. ONE MICROGRAM PER LEADER IS SAFER FOR CHILDREN THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS PER LITER AND I COULDN'T FIND ANY SO I'M WONDERING IF THAT'S THAT HAS READ THAT RESEARCH BEEN DONE BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKE DECISIONS ON A- ON THE BASIS OF SCIENTIFIC. STUDY AND JUST AFTER. YEAH YOUR YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL IN OUR GOAL THAT WAS TO DRIVE THE LEVELS DOWN BECAUSE LET IS FOR BROWN JUST SITS IN THE SOIL IT'S IN THE PAINT. AND IT'S AND- IT'S IN THE WATER VICTIMS CAN I CHALLENGE YOU TO DO ON THAT THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL. EXPO TO LEAD THAT WE'VE EVERY TIME WE'VE LOOKED WE FIND THAT THERE'S HAZARDS. TO CHILDREN AND EVEN TO ADULTS AT LOW LEVELS. THAT LOWER LOWER LOWER THAN FIVE MICROGRAMS PER LITER. YES YES OF MY CAN GIVE AN EXAMPLE IS FDA APPROVED DRUG ADMINISTRATION SAYS THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF CHILD SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO IN A DAY IS THREE MICROGRAMS. WELL IN THAT FIRST QUARTER LEADER SAMPLE THAT THE SCHOOL STATE TAKE THAT'S THREE PARTS PER BILLION SO. JUST FIFTY IT'S IT WOULD EXCEED A SINGLE SAMPLE THAT FIVE WOULD EXCEED FDA OR FTA ZONE IF THE CHILD DRANK A LITER OF WATER FROM THE FAUCET. WORTHY JUST DRINK A QUARTER LEADER OF WATER THAT HAD THAT FIGHT ON THAT AMOUNT IN IT- BECAUSE THE STANDARDS BASED ON FIVE MICROGRAMS OF LEAD IN A- IN THAT WATER THE CUT PASSES THROUGH THE FAUCET. THE ONES THAT WERE CERTIFIED. NINE MICROGRAMS IN THAT FIRST SAMPLE. SO MUCH HIGHER LEVEL SURE BUT I MEAN THE NATIONAL STANDARD IS FIVE. RIGHT SO THAT THAT THAT'S NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE CURRENT NATIONAL STANDAR IF IT AT THIRTY ONE MICROGRAMS BELIEVE WAS CERTIFIED UNDER THE CURRENT STAND. BECAUSE IT'S AVERAGED OVER THREE WEEKS OF. TESTING SO THE FOR VERY FIRST APPLES WERE THE NINE BUT THE OF MY DOWN QUICKLY RIGHT SO WITH AVERAGE TO BELOW. THE DOOR THE ONE WOULD MAKE IT. INTO THE- WOODS OUT THAT WAY. THAT THOSE FOSTER UNEXAMPLED THAT WOULD BE FREE TO I UNDERSTAND WHY AM I. YEAH I WANNA BE'S OF. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKING AND FOR TO. YEAH I'M TO SAY. THERE SHALL BE NO LEFT IN ANYTHING IS NOT. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE EVER GOING TO ACHIEVE AT AND I'M JUST A VERY CARDS BECAUSE WE'VE GOT OTHER. ISSUES THAT COME BEFORE THIS IS LIKE A HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM UNDER WATER WHICH IS NATURALLY OCCURRING DOESN'T HAVE BECOME FROM CONTAMINATION. AND TO SAY EVERY TIME THAT WE- ARE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND WE'RE GOING LOWER THE STANDARD. A BIT IN EVIDENCE YOU KNOW IT IS NOT THE- TO. JUST BECAUSE WE ENDED. LEFT AT LOWER. DOESN'T KNOW. MEAN THAT THE STANDARD OF THE LAW SO IF YOU WOULD PLEASE IF YOU COULD- THEM FROM THAT THE STUDIES THAT YOU HAVE IF YOU CAN GET THOSE TOMORROW SO I COULD REVIEW MIGHT REALLY BE PURGED OF THE FIGHTER. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HAVE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. NO OKAY WELL. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR POINTING OUT SOME OF THINGS THAT I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING BECAUSE I THINK IT IS DANGEROUS TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S SOME- THAT THERE ARE. HIGH LEVELS OF LEAD THAT EXIST WHERE THEY MAY NOT ACTUALLY EXIST AND IT'S TRUE THAT. EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS NOT HEALTHY BUT WE DO HAVE LEAD IN VARIOUS FORMS IN OUR ENVIRONMENT WHETHER IT'S IN THE PIPES THAT ARE BRINGING OUR CHECKING WATER. OR IN THE BILL. I DON'T LIKE TO HEAR THINGS THAT SOUND ALARMIST BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE CERTAINLY- CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ALLOWING OUR CHILDREN TO INGESTION YOU KNOW EVERYONE ELSE WHO'S EXPOSED TO IT AS WELL- MR HOLDEN I AM WONDERING IS THERE ANY PRIEST BUILT INTO THIS BILL TO ALLOW MANY FACTORS OF SEVENTIES POP THE ABILITY. OUT OF. THE INVENTORY THAT THEY HAVE IN REPLACE IT WITH INVENTORY THAT MEETS THE NEW. WHAT WILL LIKELY BE THE NEW STANDARD. WELL I THINK THAT THE REASON THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT WERE THEY WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE ISSUES IN GOOD FAITH IS TRYING TO GET TO A PLACE THIS TYPE OF CONCERNS CAN BE MITIGATED AT CONF AND THE RIGHT. SPOT IT SHOULD BE. BUT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT AGREE SPIRIT OR EXIST IF THIS BILL PASSES AND IS IN A BIT SIGNED INTO LAW IS IT IMMEDIATE. WELL IN TERMS OF THE IF THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES IS ON THE TABLE I THINK THAT THAT'S THE BOOK THE GRACE PERIOD YES THESE ARE PART OF DISAGREEING WITH EVERYBODY THAT IN IT AND IF I'VE GOT IT RIGHT AS WELL.
