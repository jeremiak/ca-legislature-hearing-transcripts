00:38:21.532 --> 00:38:23.434
PERIOD WE'VE HAD ABOUT A 78%

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:24.468
INCREASE.

00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:26.137
IN THE NUMBER OF UNIQUE CLIENT

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:28.406
SEEN EACH YEAR SO THAT COMES OUT

00:38:28.472 --> 00:38:30.374
TO ABOUT AN 8% INCREASE PER YEAR

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:32.309
IN UNIQUE STUDENTS COMING TO OUR

00:38:32.376 --> 00:38:33.411
COUNSELING CENTERS.

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:34.979
AT THE SAME PERIOD -- THE

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.480
ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT YOU SEE

00:38:36.547 --> 00:38:39.450
INCREASED ONLY ABOUT 27% SO YOU

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:40.051
CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:38:40.117 --> 00:38:40.718
OTHER.

00:38:40.785 --> 00:38:42.186
SIGNIFICANT FACTORS DRIVING

00:38:42.253 --> 00:38:44.388
DEMAND -- AND THE LAST QUICK

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:46.791
EXAMPLE -- IT THE NUMERICAL

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:48.559
EXAMPLE IS THE PERCENT OF A

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:49.827
STUDENT SEEN AS A PERCENT OF

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:51.495
ENROLLMENT UNIQUE CLIENTS -- TEN

YEARS AGO WAS ABOUT 9% OF OUR

ENROLLMENT AND NOW IT'S ABOUT

00:38:55.099 --> 00:38:57.835
13% -- IN THE LAST ACADEMIC YEAR.

00:38:57.902 --> 00:38:59.136
THE OTHER THING OUR COUNSELORS

00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:01.739
REALLY HARP ON IS JUST THE THE

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.474
REALLY INCREASE IN SEVERITY OF

00:39:03.541 --> 00:39:05.109
ILLNESS THEY'RE SEEING MANY

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.011
STUDENTS ARE ARRIVING AT UC

ALREADY ON MEDICATIONS.

00:39:08.446 --> 00:39:10.381
OTHER STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING TO

00:40:54.285 --> 00:40:55.853
TOUCH ON THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.221
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THROUGH

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.589
THIS FUNDING INITIATIVE THAT

00:40:58.656 --> 00:40:59.690
STARTED IN.

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.559
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WE'VE

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:03.360
HIRED ALMOST SEVENTY F. T. OF

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:04.361
COUNSELORS.

00:41:04.428 --> 00:41:05.996
A WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DECREASE

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.364
THE AVERAGE WAIT TIME FOR OUR

00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:09.300
STUDENTS -- COMING IN FOR A

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:11.735
ROUTINE INTAKE FROM TWELVE TO

FUNDING ARRIVING -- WITHIN THE

00:41:15.472 --> 00:41:17.074
FIRST YEAR OR TWO WE GOT IT DOWN

00:41:17.141 --> 00:41:18.509
TO AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT NINE DAYS

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.211
AND THAT'S DRIFTED BACK UP TO

00:41:20.277 --> 00:41:22.413
ABOUT ELEVEN DAYS IN THE CURRENT

00:41:22.479 --> 00:41:23.013
YEAR.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.481
ANOTHER A MARKER THAT WE USE TO

00:41:24.548 --> 00:41:26.483
MEASURE HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IS

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.018
THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:30.754
SEEN IN A AND FOURTEEN CALENDAR

00:41:30.821 --> 00:41:30.955
DAYS.

00:41:31.021 --> 00:41:32.990
ADDITIONALLY AFTER WE STARTED

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:35.559
THIS -- FUNDING INITIATIVE WE

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.727
FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR WERE

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:38.762
ABLE TO GET 80% OF OUR STUDENTS

00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:40.264
WITHIN FOURTEEN DAYS.

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:42.099
THAT HAS GRADUALLY DRIFTED DOWN

00:41:42.166 --> 00:41:43.834
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS

00:41:43.901 --> 00:41:48.272
AND 278% AND 74% -- BECAUSE OUR

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:51.809
ENROLLMENT GROWTH IS CONTINUING --

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.777
TO INCREASE AND AS I'VE

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.145
MENTIONED BEFORE THERE ARE OTHER

00:41:55.212 --> 00:41:57.448
FACTORS THAT ARE VERY MUCH

00:41:57.514 --> 00:41:58.716
DRIVING DEMAND FOR OUR STUDENTS.

00:41:58.782 --> 00:42:01.218
WE'VE ACHIEVED VERY MUCH IMPROVE

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:03.954
STUDENT SATISFACTION -- SCORES

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:05.689
WITH OUR ACCESS -- WE'VE ALSO

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:07.191
BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME INNOVATIVE

00:42:07.258 --> 00:42:09.393
THINGS -- WHICH INCLUDES

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.895
IMPLEMENTING CASE MANAGERS FOR

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:12.263
COMPLICATED ILLNESSES THAT

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.998
INVOLVE COORDINATED CARE BETWEEN

00:42:14.064 --> 00:42:15.299
A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS.

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:16.700
MANY OF OUR CENTERS HAVE MOVED

00:42:16.767 --> 00:42:19.436
COUNSELORS INTO THE URGENT CARE

00:42:19.503 --> 00:42:21.138
OR INTO THE MEDICAL CLINICS TO

TRYING BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:23.874
WHEN A DISTRESSED STUDENT

00:42:23.941 --> 00:42:25.976
ARRIVES -- FOR ANOTHER REASON IN

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.778
A MEDICAL CLINIC OR DECIDES TO

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:30.614
GO THERE FIRST -- WE'VE ALSO FOR

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.682
THE PAST THREE YEARS BEEN ABLE

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.250
TO HOLD CULTURAL COMPETENCY

00:42:33.317 --> 00:42:35.119
TRAINING FOR ALL OF OUR MENTAL

00:42:35.185 --> 00:42:38.122

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:38.822
PAST THAT HAS BEEN IN

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:40.457
COLLABORATION WITH CSU IN A

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:41.425
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WE'RE

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.927
CONTINUING TO WORK.

00:42:42.993 --> 00:42:44.295
ON TRAINING OUR MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:44.361 --> 00:42:48.098

AWARE AND PROVIDE CONFIDENCE

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.138
SERVICES LASTLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:42:54.204 --> 00:42:55.205
THE PILOT -- DIGITAL

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.407
TECHNOLOGIES WEB BASED --

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.374
TECHNOLOGIES TO ASSIST STUDENTS

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.476
AND AS AN ADJUNCT TO CARE TO

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:00.444
COUNSELING CARE AS WELL AS

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:03.314
FELLOW BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES.

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.816
NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS SLIDE -- SIX

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:08.319
TALKS ABOUT -- CONSEQUENCES FOR

00:43:08.385 --> 00:43:09.753
ARE YOU SEE STUDENTS IF OUR

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.654
CURRENT FUNDING IN THE CURRENT

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:12.356
YEAR DOES EXPIRE ONJUNE

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:15.125
THIRTIETH -- UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:43:15.192 --> 00:43:17.227
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN.

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:18.696
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE F. T. E. OF

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:21.332
COUNSELORS THAT WE HIRED -- JUST

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:23.634
PRIOR TO THIS YEAR -- THIS WOULD

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.602
BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS FOR US

00:43:25.669 --> 00:43:28.072
BOTH IN -- THE PERCENTAGE OF NEW

00:43:28.138 --> 00:43:29.740
HIRES IN THE PAST THREE YEARS --

00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:30.607
ALMOST A THIRD OF THOSE ARE

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:31.775
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A THIRD IN

00:43:31.842 --> 00:43:33.911
ABOUT 10% OF OUR COUNSELING

00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:35.112
STAFF IN ITS ENTIRETY.

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:36.246
WE ARE QUITE SURE THAT THIS

00:43:36.313 --> 00:43:38.716
WOULD WORSEN ACCESSIBILITY AND

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:39.984
CREATE DELAYS FOR STUDENTS IT

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.185
WOULD DEFINITELY DECREASE

00:43:41.251 --> 00:43:42.753
PROVIDER DIVERSITY THOSE ARE

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.823
SOME OF THE HARDEST -- PROVIDERS

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.925
TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN

00:43:47.992 --> 00:43:49.326
AND A MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:51.261
HIRED RECENTLY AND WE BELIEVE IT

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:53.764
WOULD AFFECT SAFETY AS WELL AS

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.933
STUDENT SATISFACTION.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.768
IF -- WE WERE DID HAVE THE

00:43:57.835 --> 00:43:58.736
OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.604
ADDITIONAL OF FUNDS IN ADDITION

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.106
TO MAINTAINING OUR OUR CURRENT

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:03.741
ONE TIME FUNDS WHAT WOULD WE DO

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.010
WITHOUT -- YOU SEE IS PREPARED

00:44:06.076 --> 00:44:08.012
TO HIRE THE REMAINING --

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.246
THIRTEEN F. T. EVER COUNSELORS

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.647
THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED

00:44:10.714 --> 00:44:12.249
IN THIS FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.584
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO STABILIZE

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:14.952
FUNDING FOR SOME OF OUR EXISTING

00:44:15.019 --> 00:44:16.286
HIRES AND STAFF WERE ON

00:44:16.353 --> 00:44:17.521
TEMPORARY FUNDS.

00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.056
AND REALLY ALLOW US TO START

00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:20.858
WORKING ON TARGETED PREVENTION

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:23.627
WORK -- OVERALL NET EFFECT WE

00:44:23.694 --> 00:44:25.863
WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN AT

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.197
THE VERY LEAST IF NOT IMPROVE

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:29.933
OUR CAPACITY -- CONTINUE TO

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.568
ENHANCE OUR PROVIDER DIVERSITY.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.337
AND TRIED.

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:35.305
TO MINIMIZE THE CHANCE THAT OUR

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:35.906
ACCESSIBILITY IS GOING TO GO

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.741
DOWN WE WANT TO MAINTAIN STUDENT

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:38.909
SAFETY.

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:40.844
AND THEN FINALLY REALLY WORK ON

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:42.346

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.573

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:53.009
PREVENTION.

00:56:53.076 --> 00:56:55.178
AND TO INCREASE RELATIONSHIPS

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:57.580
WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH --

00:56:57.647 --> 00:57:00.016
WE DO HAVE A FULL DIRECTORY THAT

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:02.018
WE PROVIDE TO THE COLLEGES THAT

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:04.554
TELLS THEM WHO IS THERE AN HSA

WITH THEM TO BRIDGE THOSE

00:57:09.058 --> 00:57:12.462
RELATIONSHIPS I THINK SOMETIMES

00:57:12.529 --> 00:57:15.098
HOWEVER -- THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:17.367
HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AREN'T ALWAYS

00:57:17.433 --> 00:57:21.137
AS STUDENT ORIENTED -- AS ONE

00:57:21.204 --> 00:57:23.740

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.380
LESSER DEGREE OF MENTAL ILLNESS

00:57:30.446 --> 00:57:31.714

NECESSARILY MEET THE CRITERIA.

00:57:36.152 --> 00:57:38.054
OF WHAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:57:38.121 --> 00:57:40.089
REQUIRES IN TERMS OF GETTING

00:57:40.156 --> 00:57:42.125

SERIOUS AND SIGNIFICANT --

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.995
MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS -- SO

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.564
THEY DON'T MEET THE ELIGIBILITY

FOR COUNTY SERVICES IN EVERY

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:51.034
INSTANCE INSIDE I THINK IT'S

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.236
WORTH NOTING -- IT IS MY

00:57:53.303 --> 00:57:54.404

ALSO ALLOWED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT

01:02:24.073 --> 01:02:26.943
OF INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS WHERE OUR

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.544
COUNTERPART TO THE FOUR YEAR

SCHOOLS HAVE CREATED SOME

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:37.987
INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND LEVERAGING

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:43.526

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.573
ONGOING MONEY WOULD BE GREAT BUT

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.242
I THINK WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS

01:02:59.308 --> 01:03:00.610
PEOPLE WILL BE LAID OFF YEAH

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:03.212

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:32.308
WEEK.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.476
AS AN EMPLOYEE LEADERS

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:36.979
CALIFORNIA OR IS -- YOU KNOW

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:38.681
JAMES MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:39.815
WHAT I WOULD SAY IS I THINK MANY

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.317
OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.785
HAVE SUCH ARRANGEMENTS THAT THEY

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.187
DON'T NECESSARILY AREN'T

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.588
CARRYING THE FULL OVERHEAD.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.323
OF A 100% OF THE COST OF A

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.624
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AT

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:49.926
EACH OF THE CAMPUS IS SPECIALLY

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:51.794
FOR SMALLER CAMPUSES SO I THINK

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:53.229
THAT IS ACTUALLY THE PRACTICE

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.197
THAT HAPPENS.

01:03:54.263 --> 01:03:55.631
IN MANY OF THE SMALLER COLLEGES

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:57.400
WHERE THEY CONTRACT FOR CERTAIN

01:03:57.466 --> 01:03:58.167
NUMBER OF HOURS WITH

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:03.439
PROFESSIONAL OKAY DID THAT CSU

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.474
FOLKS WHEN THE SAME THING HERE.

01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.442
WELL I THINK FOR US WE'RE WE'RE

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.977
LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIP AS BEING

01:04:08.044 --> 01:04:09.412
KIND OF THE CRUX OF ARM MIDDLE

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:10.947
HOLE SUPPORT -- BECAUSE OUR

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.949
CAMPUSES AS WELL OR NOT

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.516
NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE WITH

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:17.186
HIRING -- MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT IT

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.888
BEING ON GOING SO WHAT WE'RE

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:20.823
TRYING TO DO AND ACTUALLY ONE OF

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:22.825
OUR MODELS -- AT CSU SAN

01:04:22.892 --> 01:04:24.460
BERNARDINO AS THEY WORK WITH THE

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:26.862
COUNTY AND THE COUNTY PROVIDES

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:29.632
AND A PERSON A COUNSELOR CASE

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:32.401
MANAGER TO THAT ACTUALLY SEES

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.036
STUDENTS ON CAMPUS.

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.238
AND SO THIS IS ONE OF THE MODELS

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:37.206
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE EXPANDED

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:40.009
WITH THE POTENTIAL OF SIXTEEN

01:04:40.076 --> 01:04:41.544
EIGHTY NINE AND THEN ALSO -- THE

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:43.579
SB ONE THOUSAND FOUR DOLLARS SO

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:44.547
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:47.016
PARTNERSHIPS UNDERSTANDING THAT --

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.517
ALLY THE NEED TO DO GO BEYOND

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.353
THE CAMPUS SCOPE AND HOW WE'RE

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:53.990
ABLE TO LEVERAGE -- LEVERAGE

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:54.423
THAT WITH OUR COUNTY

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:55.925
PARTNERSHIPS.

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:58.294
SO I ACTUALLY DO AN AD REMEDIAL

01:04:58.361 --> 01:04:59.495
FROM THE CSU OFFICE OF THE

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.730
CHANCELLOR AS WELL ON THE IDEA

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:01.764
OF THE CONTRACTED A WORKERS WE

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:03.733
ACTUALLY DO THAT WITH PSYCHIATRY.

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.134
PSYCHIATRY'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.836
HIGHEST NEED THAT WE'RE FINDING

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:08.337
IN OUR SYSTEM BUT IT STILL COMES

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:09.672
WITH CHALLENGES BECAUSE IT'S A

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:11.040
CHI TREES IN HIGH DEMAND ON

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.475
CAMPUS AS WELL AS OFF CAMPUS OF

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:13.743
THEIR TIME IS LIMITED.

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:15.745
AS WELL AS THE COST IS VERY VERY

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.413
HIGH YEAH -- SO THE MENTAL

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.115
HEALTH CERTAINLY WE HAVE SOME

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.950
COMMUNITIES THAT DO HAVE SOME

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.585
PROVIDERS THAT COULD IN FACT BE

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:24.754
AVAILABLE ON A RETAINER TO HELP

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.656
OUT PERIODICALLY ON OUR CAMPUSES.

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:28.057
THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITIES LIKE

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:29.525
HUMBOLDT THAT THEY'RE JUST DON'T

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:30.960
EXIST SO THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.261
STRAPPED JUST BECAUSE IT

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.030
AVAILABILITY OF PROVIDERS BUT

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:36.465
ALSO IT WOULD ANTICIPATE AND

01:05:36.532 --> 01:05:37.300
HAVING CONTRACTED WORK.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:39.302
WE WOULD MOST LIKELY PROBABLY

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:44.674
RUN INTO SOME COLLECTIVE

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:45.941
BARGAINING ISSUES ON THAT

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:46.242
[inaudible]

01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.842
OKAY [inaudible]

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:48.744
OKAY.

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:51.514
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S NEXT --

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.616
BRING OUT FOR SEASON QUESTIONS

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:56.285
FOR THE FOLKS.

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:57.620
SACRAMENTO BEE AT OF FRONT PAGE

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:58.988
STORY I BELIEVE YESTERDAY ON THE

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:00.022
BERKELEY STUDY ON A MENTAL

01:06:00.089 --> 01:06:00.756
HEALTH.

01:06:00.823 --> 01:06:03.192
IN -- IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION NOT

01:06:03.259 --> 01:06:04.894
ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:07.263
THE UNITED STATES.

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.098
AND I I I I THINK THE THE

01:06:09.165 --> 01:06:12.768
BERKELEY STUDY -- WAS VERY --

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:15.071
VERY MUCH -- SHOWING THE SAME

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:17.173
KIND OF DATA THAT I'M LOOKING AT

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:21.010
HERE ON THE ESCALATING DEMAND.

01:06:21.077 --> 01:06:25.047
OF FROM FROM UC -- WHEN WE WERE

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.149
ON AT ON THE UCLA CAMPUS WE

01:06:27.216 --> 01:06:29.118
HEARD A LOT FROM STUDENTS ABOUT

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:32.455
THE NEED FOR OF PRACTITIONERS

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:34.924
WHO REFLECTED THEIR THEIR THEIR

01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:37.293
THEIR CULTURES THEIR LANGUAGES --

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.728
SO WONDERED IF YOU MIGHT WANT TO

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:41.130
COMMENT ON EITHER OF THOSE TWO

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:42.598
THINGS SURE I'LL JUST MENTION IN

01:06:42.665 --> 01:06:44.367
OUR IN OUR FIVE YEAR INITIATIVE

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:47.470
THAT WE HAD -- UNDERTAKEN IN --

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:48.604
TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE THAN 50% OF

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:53.376
THOSE PROVIDERS WERE -- WE

01:06:53.442 --> 01:06:54.343
ATTEMPTED TO FILL THOSE

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.580
POSITIONS WITH -- A PROVIDERS

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:58.981
WITH BACKGROUNDS ETHNICITIES

01:06:59.048 --> 01:07:01.650
WILL -- THE KINDS OF COUNSELORS --

01:07:01.717 --> 01:07:03.953
THAT REFLECTED OUR STATE BETTER

01:07:04.019 --> 01:07:05.688
REFLECTED OUR STUDENT POPULATION --

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.423
AND SO THAT'S AS I MENTIONED

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:08.491
EARLIER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:07:08.557 --> 01:07:09.525
WERE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.060
PROVIDERS ARE ALWAYS HARDER TO

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:12.895
FIND HARDER TO RECRUIT AND

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.096
HARDER TO RETAIN.

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:16.966
AND SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TO

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:21.537
HIRE -- I THINK OUT OF THE

01:07:21.604 --> 01:07:22.138
SEVENTY THAT I MENTIONED US.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:23.372
IT'S CLOSE TO FIFTY OF THOSE

01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:25.307
PROVIDERS WERE WERE TARGETED BY

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:26.742
THEIR CAMPUSES BASED ON THE

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:33.149
CAMPUS THE CIVIC POPULATIONS.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.818
STRATEGY THANK YOU I APOLOGIZE

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:36.986
FOR COMING IN LATE AND SO -- THE

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:39.321
PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ME IF IF YOU

01:07:39.388 --> 01:07:43.025
COVER THIS BUT TO WE WE WE'VE

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:44.560
BEEN HAVING TO SEVERAL.

01:07:44.627 --> 01:07:46.896
HEARINGS -- IN THE AT ADDRESSING

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:50.833
GO -- IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER --

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:53.436
THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH --

01:07:53.502 --> 01:07:56.205
NEEDS WHAT IS DRIVING THIS.

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:58.340
THIS ESCALATING DEMAND AND

01:07:58.407 --> 01:07:59.842
INCREASING SEVERITY OF ILLNESS

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:01.177
BUT YOU KNOW I I I THINK IT'S

01:08:01.243 --> 01:08:02.678
MULTI FACTORIAL AND EVERYBODY

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:04.246
HERE COULD PROBABLY COMMENT I I

01:08:04.313 --> 01:08:08.017
THINK THAT -- A NUMBER OF THINGS

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.618
LOWERING THE STIGMA SO A LOT OF

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:10.686
THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.188
ACTUALLY MAKES IT MORE LIKELY

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:13.522
THAT STUDENTS WILL COME IN WHO

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.357
HAVE LOWER LEVEL SYMPTOMATOLOGY

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.625
THEY'RE MORE WILLING TO COME IN

01:08:16.692 --> 01:08:18.594
IT'S NOT A SCARY IF THEY START.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.629
TO THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE -- AN

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:22.198
ISSUE WITH THAT MIGHT BE YOU

01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:23.499
KNOW WORKED OUT THROUGH THROUGH

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.100
COUNSELING SO SO THAT'S THAT'S A

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.803
VERY BIG FACTOR I THINK.

01:08:27.870 --> 01:08:29.071
YOU KNOW THIS THIS --

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.040
GENERATIONAL COHORT AND AND THAT

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:32.141
KIND OF ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.809
GROWN UP IN I THINK AGAIN WE

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:35.211
HAVE MANY MORE UNDOCUMENTED

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.779
STUDENTS THE POLITICAL SITUATION

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:37.980
CERTAINLY IS PUTTING A LOT OF

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:41.183
STRESS ON ON MANY MANY STUDENTS --

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:44.320
FINANCIAL PRESSURES -- CONCERNED --

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.489
ABOUT THEIR WELL BEING ON CAMPUS

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.257
OR IF THEY ENGAGE WITH STUDENT

01:08:48.324 --> 01:08:49.658
HEALTH AND COUNSELLING OR WHAT

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:50.926
HOW WITH THOSE RECORDS

01:08:50.993 --> 01:08:52.728
POTENTIALLY BE USED AGAINST THEM --

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:53.963
WE HAVE MORE TRANSFER STUDENTS

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.698
AND THEY I THINK HAVE A UNIQUE

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:57.666
CHALLENGES COMPARED TO SOMEONE --

01:08:57.733 --> 01:08:59.668
WHO WHO WHO COMES ON SO I THINK

01:08:59.735 --> 01:09:01.704
YOU KNOW GREAT COMPETITION --

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.205
THEY'RE USED TO BEING OF THE

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.940
BRIGHTEST -- OF THEIR CLASSES IN

01:09:05.007 --> 01:09:06.108
HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY ARRIVE AT

01:09:06.175 --> 01:09:07.776
UNIVERSITIES AND NOW EVERYBODY'S

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:08.944
AT THAT LEVEL OF THOUGHT HIGHER

01:09:09.011 --> 01:09:10.412
AND SUDDENLY SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.147
A STRAIGHT A STUDENT IS GETTING

01:09:12.214 --> 01:09:13.682
A LOT OF BEES IN THE FIRST.

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:15.951
QUARTER OR SEMESTER AND AND AND

01:09:16.018 --> 01:09:17.419
IT'S A YOU KNOW IT'S AN ADAPTION

01:09:17.486 --> 01:09:19.588
THEY HAVE TO MAKE SO I I DON'T

01:09:19.655 --> 01:09:20.256
KNOW IF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE

01:09:20.322 --> 01:09:20.990
OTHER.

01:09:21.056 --> 01:09:21.724
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE STRONGEST

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:26.061
FACTORS BUT IT'S REALLY A LOT OF

01:09:26.128 --> 01:09:27.029
THINGS HAPPENING.

01:09:27.096 --> 01:09:28.731
SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU KNOW ONE

01:09:28.797 --> 01:09:29.598
THING I THINK THAT THAT YOU

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:30.466
ALLUDED TO AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE

01:09:30.533 --> 01:09:32.234
DID THE SIGNIFICANT WORK BACK

01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:34.136
STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.704
AT WITH AN HSA PROP SIXTY THREE

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:36.438
DOLLARS.

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:39.475
I THINK ACROSS ALL THREE SYSTEMS --

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:40.943
THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK AND WORK

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:43.579
CONTINUES AROUND REDUCING STIGMA.

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:45.180
AND AROUND TO CULTURAL

01:09:45.247 --> 01:09:47.016
COMPETENCE AND ADDRESSING THE

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.350
UNIQUE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT

01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:50.085
STUDENT POPULATIONS INCLUDING

01:09:50.152 --> 01:09:51.554
THAT INCLUDING LATINO STUDENTS

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:52.788
INCLUDING.

01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:55.157
STUDENTS OF COLOR WHO WHERE FROM

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.692
THEIR CULTURES THERE MAY BE TOO

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:58.861
MUCH STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH THEM

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.396
ACCESSING CARE AND THEN THEY

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:01.864
FIND SOME INDEPENDENCE WHEN THEY

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.065
COME TO COLLEGE IN WHEN YOU'RE

01:10:03.132 --> 01:10:04.600
WORKING ON REDUCING STIGMA.

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.435
AND YOU'RE MAKING IT OKAY TO GET

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:10.172
HELP -- I THINK IT'S NOT A BAD

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:12.308
THING FOR PEOPLE TO GET HELP I

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:14.577
THINK -- THAT SOME OF THE

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:16.178
INCREASE IN ACCESSING SERVICES

01:10:16.245 --> 01:10:17.980
HAS TO DO WITH THAT REDUCTION

01:10:18.047 --> 01:10:19.081
AND STIGMA.

01:10:19.148 --> 01:10:23.218

INSTITUTIONS TO TRY TO PROVIDE

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:43.973

UP TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE -- BUT

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.638
THE BOTTOM LINE IS IS THIS FROM

OUR PERSPECTIVE THE STEINBERG

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.041
INSTITUTE IS THAT.

01:14:39.107 --> 01:14:40.542
THE AVAILABILITY OF STUDENT

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:42.744
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- MUST

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.646
BE A STATEWIDE PRIORITY BECAUSE

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.048
MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN

01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:46.815
MAKE SUCH A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.650
LIVES.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:49.351
OF STUDENTS.

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.419
AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:51.453
CALIFORNIA INTERVIEWS WITH YOUNG

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.183
SOME OF HER EXPERIENCE.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:22.985
HEY -- MY NAME IS MARY ELIZABETH

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.052
ALEXANDER AND LIKE SHE SAID I'M

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.054
A STUDENT AT SAC CITY COLLEGE

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:27.956
AND I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT MY

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:29.424
OWN MENTAL HEALTH EXPERIENCES

01:15:29.491 --> 01:15:30.926
WHILE I'VE BEEN IN COLLEGE.

01:15:30.993 --> 01:15:32.861
AND I'VE STRUGGLED WITH BOTH

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:34.229
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SINCE

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.898
CHILDHOOD AND HAVE BEEN

01:15:35.964 --> 01:15:38.166
DIAGNOSED WITH SOCIAL ANXIETY IN

01:15:38.233 --> 01:15:39.801
PTSD.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.837
IN COLLEGE I FELT THE CRUSHING

01:15:41.904 --> 01:15:43.505
DREAD OF THE FUTURE AND OF

01:15:43.572 --> 01:15:45.474
POTENTIAL FAILURE AND THE HIGH

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.175
PRESSURE OF MY CLASSES.

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:48.243
THEN THERE IS THE FEAR AND

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:49.978
UNCERTAINTY OF MY CLASSMATES

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:52.714
FEEDING INTO MY OWN AN EASE.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:55.417
I WOULD SET EVERY DAY IN CLASSES

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:56.518
ON ALLOWED.

01:15:56.585 --> 01:15:59.021
BUSTLING CAMPUS AS MY SOCIAL

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.989
ANXIETY MADE ME WANT TO HIDE.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:01.890
I STARTED MISSING CLASSES

01:16:01.957 --> 01:16:03.091
BECAUSE I WAS TOO SCARED TO BE

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.993
AROUND PEOPLE.

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:06.428
THE TIPPING POINT FOR ME WAS AND

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:08.530
A SOCIOLOGY CLASS. ONE OF THE

01:16:08.597 --> 01:16:09.898
LAST TWO CLASSES OF THAT

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:11.500
SEMESTER THAT I HADN'T DROPPED

01:16:11.566 --> 01:16:14.136
DUE TO MY INCREASING ANXIETY.

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:14.903
AND THE THE BIGGEST MOMENT OF

01:16:14.970 --> 01:16:16.705
THE SEMESTER WAS A SOCIAL NORM

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:18.740
REACH EXPERIMENT -- THAT WE'RE

01:16:18.807 --> 01:16:19.908
SUPPOSED TO GO BEHAVE STRANGELY

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:21.543
IN PUBLIC TO GET REACTIONS OUT

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:22.444
OF PEOPE.

01:16:22.511 --> 01:16:24.446
AND I COULDN'T.

01:16:24.513 --> 01:16:27.449
I COULDN'T EVEN GO OUTSIDE.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.551
I TRIED TO WORK UP THE COURAGE

01:16:29.618 --> 01:16:30.953
BUT I STRUGGLED WITH THAT AIM OF

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.154
CALLING ATTENTION TO MYSELF AND

01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.822
PUBLIC.

01:16:33.889 --> 01:16:35.090
THE ASSIGNMENT WAS ESSENTIAL FOR

01:16:35.157 --> 01:16:36.792
THE CLASS AND TO MESSAGE MEANT

01:16:36.858 --> 01:16:37.960
FAILURE.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:40.262
COULD ADDED TO MY LIST OF THAT

01:16:50.872 --> 01:16:52.808
PERSONAL LIFE CULMINATED AND

01:16:52.874 --> 01:16:54.977
ENDED WITH ME FEELING BROKEN.

01:16:55.043 --> 01:16:56.511
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIND HELP.

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:57.612

I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH

WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:37.312
BECAUSE -- THIS IS BIGGER I'VE

01:23:37.379 --> 01:23:39.714
NEVER HEARD AS MUCH FROM THE K.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:41.916
TO TWELVE COMMUNITY -- THAT

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:42.784
TALKS ABOUT THE NEED FOR MENTAL

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.786
HEALTH I KNOW THAT WHEN SCHOOL

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:46.287
BOARD MEMBERS CAME UP HERE THAT

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:47.922
WAS ONE OF THEIR TOP ISSUES I

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:49.324
THINK ABOUT THE CONNECTION IT

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.926
HAS TO THE STUDENTS IN HIGHER ED --

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.628
THESE ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:55.363
THESE ARE CONNECTED AND SO I

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.699
JUST WONDER IF THERE IS A WAY

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.267
FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.302
IMPACT THE SYSTEM -- MAKE WE

01:24:01.369 --> 01:24:03.938
CLEARLY NEED TO DO SOMETHING

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:05.507
ABOUT IT I JUST DON'T.

01:24:05.573 --> 01:24:08.710
NO WHERE OR HOW -- AND IT'S NO

01:24:08.777 --> 01:24:11.045
DOUBT THATINVESTMENT OF FUNDS

01:24:11.112 --> 01:24:13.114
IS ONE APPROACH BUT I THINK.

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.849
MORE BROADLY -- THINKING ABOUT%

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.284
THE FACT THAT K. TWELVE IS

01:24:16.351 --> 01:24:17.986
ASKING US FOR THIS HIGHER AT IS

01:24:18.052 --> 01:24:20.121
ASKING US FOR THIS -- AND THE

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.857
NEED IN THE GAP IS -- BECOMING

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:23.725
MUCH GREATER [inaudible]

01:24:23.792 --> 01:24:25.960
THANK YOU.

01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:26.795

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:37.272
AND THEY HAVE A LIST OF

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.040
PROPOSALS AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:41.176
HAVE TO COMPETE BUT I THINK WE

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:42.577
OUGHT TO BE.

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:45.079
FOCUSING ON ON BOTH POPULATIONS

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:46.815
AND I THINK THE ISSUE HERE IS.

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:48.850
THAT THAT PROP SIXTY THREE THE

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.485

01:24:50.552 --> 01:24:51.419
IT WAS APPROVED.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.388
WAS GONNA BE ABOUT A BILLION

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.590
DOLLARS A YEAR NOW IT'S THREE

01:24:55.657 --> 01:24:57.826
TWO POINT FOUR BILLION FOR YEAH.

01:24:57.892 --> 01:24:59.761
SO THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY IN IT

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.996
AND A LOT IS GOING OUT TO THE

01:25:02.063 --> 01:25:03.498

NUMBER OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:27.101

INTERCHANGEABLE -- SET OF SKILLS

01:29:28.963 --> 01:29:30.798

PROCEED WITH THE SCHOOLING AT

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.628
THE SCHOOL AND ALSO DROPPING OUT --

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.463
I BELIEVE LIKE IT'S ALSO

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.065
INTERESTING BECAUSELIKE A KEY

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.032
WORD THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE BRING

01:37:52.099 --> 01:37:53.701
UP NOW IT'S LIKE THIS IDEA OF

01:37:53.767 --> 01:37:56.237
LIKE INCLUSIVE EXCELLENCE BUT

01:37:56.303 --> 01:37:57.538
THE WAY IN WHICH WE DO THAT IS

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.273
TO LIKE ACADEMIC EQUITY RIGHT.

01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:00.507
BUT A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:02.509
STUDENTS BASED ON OUR CAMPUS OR

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.578

HOMELESS WE HAVE LOTS OF

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:09.917

AND THOSE THINGS ALL CULMINATE

01:38:12.453 --> 01:38:13.954
IN THE FACT THAT LIKE THEIR

01:38:14.021 --> 01:38:15.489
MENTAL HEALTH IS BEING IMPACTED

01:38:15.556 --> 01:38:16.390
AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THIS

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:18.025
BIGGER QUESTION OF LIKE.

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.293
HOW CAN STUDENTS GO ABOUT LIKE

ON THE FACT THAT LIKE AT UC

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:34.642
BERKELEY THE BLACK POPULATION IS

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:36.377
ONE POINT 9%.

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:36.910
AND WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF

01:38:36.977 --> 01:38:37.544
STUDENTS DROP OUT BECAUSE THEY

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:38.812
CANNOT GO AND BE SEEN FOR LIKE

01:38:38.879 --> 01:38:39.813
OTHER SOCIAL ISSUES THAT THEY

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.181
MAY HAVE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL.

01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:42.716
WE ALSO HAVE TO REALIZE THAT MY

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:43.717
TWO EYES IDENTITIES TO CALM WITH

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:44.985

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:45.519
IN LIKE THEY NEED TO BE A

01:38:45.586 --> 01:38:46.553
DRASTIC LIKE IF THEY'RE NOT

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.122

WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE FACULTY

01:56:24.811 --> 01:56:27.547
MERITS ANNUALLY BECAUSE IN

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.147
NINETEEN NINETY THREE WE LOST

01:56:28.214 --> 01:56:29.549
THE CASE IN SAN FRANCISCO

FACULTY COMPENSATION PIECES OF

01:56:49.402 --> 01:56:50.536
FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:51.971
DOLLARS TO FUND AN AVERAGE

A LOT OF RANK FACULTY IN THE

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:58.010
UNIVERSITY.

01:56:58.077 --> 01:56:59.445
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO PROPOSING

01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:00.947
ANOTHER THIRTEEN POINT NINE

01:57:01.013 --> 01:57:02.849
MILLION FOUR SEPARATE SALARY

EFFORT TO CLOSE TO UNIVERSITIES

01:57:06.352 --> 01:57:08.087
LOT OF RANK FACULTY SALARY GAP.

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:10.623
WITH OUR COMPETITOR INSTITUTIONS

01:57:10.690 --> 01:57:13.059
OVER TIME AND ON SLIDE EIGHT

01:57:13.126 --> 01:57:14.927
YOU'LL SEE THAT -- WHERE THE

01:57:14.994 --> 01:57:16.662
UNIVERSITY SALARIES ARE ARE

01:57:16.729 --> 01:57:19.365
BELOW -- WHERE ARE COMPARISON

01:57:19.432 --> 01:57:21.567
INSTITUTES CURRENTLY ARE WHERE

01:57:21.634 --> 01:57:24.003
ABOUT SIX POINT 7% BELOW ON

01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:25.238
SLIDE?

01:57:25.304 --> 01:57:27.206
EIGHT YOU WILL SEE A CHART THAT

01:57:27.273 --> 01:57:29.275
SHOWS THAT -- WHERE SIX POINT

01:57:29.342 --> 01:57:30.810
SEVEN BELOW ARE COMPARISON

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:34.881
INSTITUTES -- WHEN FACULTY LEAVE

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:37.083
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:38.284
FIFTEEN OUT OF TWENTY LEE FOR

01:57:38.351 --> 01:57:39.952
PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES WHICH IS

01:57:40.019 --> 01:57:41.721
WHY WE DO THINK THAT COMPARING

01:57:41.788 --> 01:57:42.622
OURSELVES TO PRIVATE

01:57:42.688 --> 01:57:44.791
INSTITUTIONS CONTINUES TO BE A

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:47.860
RELEVANT METRIC -- UC'S

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:49.228
COMPARISON INSTITUTIONS WERE

01:57:49.295 --> 01:57:50.963
SELECTED AFTER AN EXTENSIVE

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:53.933
DISCUSSION WITH THE LA -- AND

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.668
THE NOW DEFUNCT C. PACK THE

01:57:55.735 --> 01:57:58.204
TECHNOLOGY EXISTS THERE MAY BE --

01:57:58.271 --> 01:58:01.274
SOME -- REASON MAYBE TO GO BACK

01:58:01.340 --> 01:58:02.942
AND RE EXAMINE THOSE AT SOME

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:04.944
POINT BUT THERE CURRENTLY ARE

01:58:05.011 --> 01:58:06.579
THE BEST THAT -- METRIC THAT WE

01:58:06.646 --> 01:58:07.880
DO HAVE.

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:10.783
THERE WAS A NINETY TWENTY

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:11.651
SIXTEEN STUDY THAT SHOWED THAT

01:58:11.717 --> 01:58:13.219
AMONG OUR FACULTY MEMBERS WHO

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:14.454
LEFT YOU SEE FOR ANOTHER

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.655
INSTITUTION.

01:58:15.721 --> 01:58:17.890
SALARY WAS THE MOST OFTEN CITED

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:18.724
REASON.

01:58:18.791 --> 01:58:20.426
SALARY WAS ALL THIS IS ALSO THE

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.761
SECOND MOST CITED REASON AMONG

01:58:21.828 --> 01:58:24.096
THOSE WHO DECIDED TO REMAIN AT

01:58:24.163 --> 01:58:27.333
UC. 91% OF WHOM RECEIVED AN

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:28.668
ADDITIONAL SALARY IN THE

01:58:28.734 --> 01:58:30.002
RETENTION OFFER.

01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:32.071
SO WE DO FIND THAT OUT TO SALARY

01:58:32.138 --> 01:58:33.573
OFFERS MAKE A SIGNIFICANT

01:58:33.639 --> 01:58:35.441
DIFFERENCE IN THE FACULTY I THE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:37.844
REMAINING WITH US OR LEAVING US

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:39.946
FOR ANOTHER INSTITUTION.

01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.314
AND THAT CONCLUDE MY

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.950
OPERATIONAL COMPONENT OPERATIONS

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:53.659
COST -- PRESENTATION -- A ANY

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:56.896
QUESTIONS -- THANK YOU.

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:57.797
I'D LIKE.

01:58:57.864 --> 01:58:59.866
TO KNOW FIRST GAS THE LA -- AND

01:58:59.932 --> 01:59:01.601
THEN -- THE UNIVERSITY

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:03.503
CALIFORNIA.

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:05.505
TO TO RESPOND BUT I I SEE IN THE

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:06.606
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON THE ISSUE

01:59:06.672 --> 01:59:10.176
OF OF FACULTY.

01:59:10.243 --> 01:59:14.013
SALARIES AND COMPETITIVENESS THE

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.481
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS INDICATES

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:16.949
THAT THE LA -- DOES KNOW THAT

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:19.218
SOME DATA SUGGESTS.

01:59:19.285 --> 01:59:21.020
YOU SEE IS COMPETITIVE IN

01:59:21.087 --> 01:59:23.089
RECRUITING FACULTY AND THAT

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:24.457
SEEMS TO BE.

01:59:24.524 --> 01:59:25.725
CONTRADICTED BY THE UC'S

01:59:25.791 --> 01:59:27.727
REPRESENTED COULD YOU ELABORATE

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:29.729
ON THAT.

01:59:29.795 --> 01:59:31.797
SURE SO I'M.

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:34.000
YOU SEE USED TO COMPREHENSIVELY

01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:36.469
GATHER DATA ON RECRUITMENT AND

01:59:36.536 --> 01:59:39.171
RETENTION OF FACULTY -- THEY

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:39.739
INDICATE THA THAT SYSTEM Y.

01:59:39.805 --> 01:59:41.307
DATA OR IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE

01:59:41.374 --> 01:59:42.775
BUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE DID AN

01:59:42.842 --> 01:59:44.210
ANALYSIS OF THE DATA THAT WAS

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.411
AVAILABLE.

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:47.213
AND WE FOUND THAT THE UNIVERSITY

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.549
WAS SUCCESSFULLY -- RECRUITING

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:51.183
AND RETAINING FACULTY WE LOOKED

01:59:51.250 --> 01:59:51.717
AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.286
MEASURES BECAUSE THAT DOES THE

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.054
SEVERAL YEARS OLD -- YOU KNOW

01:59:55.121 --> 01:59:56.422
THINGS CAN CHANGE OVER THE

01:59:56.489 --> 01:59:57.924
COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS AND SO

01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.658
WE DON'T HAVE.

01:59:58.724 --> 02:00:00.359
ANY UPDATED DATA TO REALLY

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:01.861
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE'S TECH

02:00:01.928 --> 02:00:03.162
TO GUIDE YOU ON THE ON THOSE

02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.362
DATA.

02:00:03.429 --> 02:00:06.832
THE ONE EVIDENCE WE DO HAVE HIS.

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.434
SALARY COMPARISONS.

02:00:08.501 --> 02:00:09.535
NUMBER COMES A SALARY

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:10.937
COMPARISONS THE THE KEY QUESTION

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:13.773
FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS -- WHO

02:00:13.839 --> 02:00:15.107
DOES THE LEGISLATURE WANT YOU

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:16.676
SEE TO COMPETE AGAINST?

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:17.944
THE ORIGINAL COMPARISON EAT

02:00:18.010 --> 02:00:20.212
INSTITUTIONS THAT YOU SEE --

02:00:20.279 --> 02:00:22.181
COMPARES ITSELF TO ON PAGE AIDS

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:23.749
AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S A SELECT

02:00:23.816 --> 02:00:26.519
GROUP OF PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

02:00:26.586 --> 02:00:28.588
RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES.

02:00:28.654 --> 02:00:38.097
THAT INCLUDES -- A FEW OF KEY

02:00:38.164 --> 02:00:39.732
PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS THAT EACH

02:00:39.799 --> 02:00:41.434
STATE -- AND ALSO INCLUDES A FEW

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:43.469
VERY SELECTIVE -- AN EXPENSIVE

02:00:43.536 --> 02:00:44.670
PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS.

02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:46.038
ALTERNATIVELY IN THE IN THE PAST

02:00:46.105 --> 02:00:47.440
WE'VE COMPARED UC FACULTY

02:00:47.506 --> 02:00:49.775
SALARIES TO A BROADER GROUP OF

02:00:49.842 --> 02:00:52.678
PUBLIC HI RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES.

02:00:52.745 --> 02:00:54.413
ABOUT SEVENTY OF THOSE ACROSS

02:00:54.480 --> 02:00:56.482
THE NATION.

02:00:56.549 --> 02:00:58.017
WE FIND THAT YOU SEE FACULTY ARE

02:00:58.084 --> 02:00:59.919
ARE PAID A ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:01.487
THOSE OTHER INSTITUTIONS OTHERS

02:01:01.554 --> 02:01:02.588
ARE MOSTLY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.323
AND PART OF WHAT DRIVES UP THE

02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:05.391
COMPARISON EIGHT COMPARISON OR

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:07.259

02:01:07.326 --> 02:01:08.427
HARVARD MIT.

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:09.895
AND SO THAT'S SORT OF THE KEY

02:01:09.962 --> 02:01:11.664
QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S I

02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:12.765
DOESN'T WANT YOU SEE TO COMPETE

02:01:12.832 --> 02:01:15.267
AS A AS AN ENTIRE SYSTEM AGAINST --

02:01:15.334 --> 02:01:16.335
THESE SELECT NUMBER OF

02:01:16.402 --> 02:01:18.037
INSTITUTIONS AS A WANT TO LOOK

02:01:18.104 --> 02:01:19.171
AT A BROADER NUMBER OF

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:20.506
INSTITUTIONS BUT TO KEEP.

02:01:20.573 --> 02:01:23.542
ISSUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE FACES

02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:26.579
EACH YEAR -- I DON'T HAVE THE

02:01:26.646 --> 02:01:29.015
MOST RECENT DATA ON OUR

02:01:29.081 --> 02:01:31.384
RECRUITMENT OF FACULTY -- I

02:01:31.450 --> 02:01:33.019
WOULD POINT TO SOME OF THE

02:01:33.085 --> 02:01:34.987
RETENTION DATA IN THIS WE

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.489
RECRUIT A LOT OF VERY YOUNG

FOR THEM WHAT'S CALLED START UP.

02:01:42.395 --> 02:01:44.330
WHICH IS -- SOMETIMES LABORATORY

02:01:44.397 --> 02:01:45.965
RENOVATIONS SOMETIMES ITS

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:48.167
INITIAL RESEARCH FUNDING AND SO

02:01:48.234 --> 02:01:50.202
FORTH -- THOSE CAN BE VERY

02:01:50.269 --> 02:01:52.405
ENTICING TO A YOUNG FACULTY

ORDER.

02:04:29.562 --> 02:04:31.030

NOW HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW I

02:04:42.007 --> 02:04:45.211
I I JUST DON'T SEE HOW THE

02:04:45.277 --> 02:04:46.445
UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN

02:04:46.512 --> 02:04:48.547
COMPETE WITH INSTITUTIONS LIKE

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:50.216
HARVARD STANFORD AND YELL AND IN

A YOU KNOW LIKE -- IT SEEMS LIKE

02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:58.958
THAT'S AN EASY WAY -- TO TO SKEW --

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:02.127
GOD -- COMPENSATION -- GUY

02:05:02.194 --> 02:05:05.998
COMPARISON -- BUT YEAH HI I JUST

02:05:06.065 --> 02:05:06.899

ISSUE OF OF COMPETITIVE FACULTY

02:05:09.869 --> 02:05:11.337

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.539
VERY IMPORTANT -- IT TO MAKE

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:15.007
SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE.

02:05:15.074 --> 02:05:16.775
IN A WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE THE

02:05:16.842 --> 02:05:18.477
THE COUNTRY'S BEST PUBLIC

02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:20.646
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.014
YEAH I THINK THERE'S TWO THINGS

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.115
ONE IT'S I THINK WITH THE

02:05:23.182 --> 02:05:24.917

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.318

TO HELP KEEP THE UNIVERSITY --

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:35.594
RUNNING I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.997
AS WELL WE TAKE CARE OF THEIR

02:05:38.063 --> 02:05:40.933
SALARY NEEDS BECAUSE YEAH COST

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:41.867
TO RENT BECAUSE THE FOOD IS THE

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:43.035
SAME PER FOR IT FOR THOSE

02:05:43.102 --> 02:05:44.603
INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR WAY LOWER

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:46.205
ON THE ON THE PAY SCALE THAT

02:05:46.272 --> 02:05:48.073
BEING SAID YEAH WE WE WANT TO

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.340
MAKE SURE.

02:05:48.407 --> 02:05:49.174
WE DON'T.

LOSE -- FACULTY TO OTHER PUBLIC

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:54.413
UNIVERSITIES AND AND PIRATES OF

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:56.582

BALANCING ACTS SO WE'RE TRYING.

02:05:58.250 --> 02:06:01.086
TO BALANCE OUR PRIORITIES --

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:03.422
THANK YOU [inaudible]

MISTER GALLAGHER.

02:06:05.691 --> 02:06:06.992
YES SO I THOUGHT I JUST KIND OF

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:09.128
GO THROUGH A FEW THINGS HERE --

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:10.863
YOU KNOW WE START WITH YOU KNOW

02:06:10.930 --> 02:06:12.431
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RIGHT

02:06:12.498 --> 02:06:15.734
PROVIDES -- TWO OR FORTY MILLION

02:06:15.801 --> 02:06:18.270
OF ONGOING STATE GENERAL FUND --

02:06:18.337 --> 02:06:21.173
MAN ON TOP OF THAT A HUNDRED

02:06:21.240 --> 02:06:23.776
FIFTY THREE MILLION ONE TIME --

02:06:23.842 --> 02:06:25.010
PLEASE FIFTEEN MILLION OF THAT

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:27.446
IS FOR DEGREE COMPLETION EFFORTS

02:06:27.513 --> 02:06:28.080
IT AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:28.714
THAT.

02:06:28.781 --> 02:06:30.382
YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT USING

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:33.819
THE UC EXTENSION IS IS.

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:35.154
REALLY THE BEST WAY TO GET OUT

02:06:35.220 --> 02:06:36.822
THERE AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY

02:06:36.889 --> 02:06:37.856
TO GET TO THAT TWO MORE ISSUES

02:06:37.923 --> 02:06:39.992
RIGHT AND AND SO YOU KNOW I KNOW

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:41.327
WE'LL GET TO THAT BUT YOU KNOW

02:06:41.393 --> 02:06:42.628
SO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:43.595
THINK WE CAN DO.

02:06:43.662 --> 02:06:44.797
SOME RE WORKING THERE I THINK

02:06:44.863 --> 02:06:46.632
THERE WAS ALSO WAS IT FIFTY

02:06:46.699 --> 02:06:48.300
MILLION.

02:06:48.367 --> 02:06:49.068
FOR COMPLETING A FOUR YEARS

02:06:49.134 --> 02:06:50.336
WHERE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE

02:06:50.402 --> 02:06:51.570
BIGGEST ISSUES WITH THAT IS

02:06:51.637 --> 02:06:53.706
REALLY IN THE CSU AND I WONDER

02:06:53.772 --> 02:06:55.274
IF MONEY IS ACTUALLY.

02:06:55.341 --> 02:06:57.576
BETTER SPENT THERE BUT GETTING

02:06:57.643 --> 02:06:58.777
TO SO YOU SEE REQUEST.

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:00.079
ON TOP OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY

02:07:00.145 --> 02:07:02.247
PROPOSED WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:03.482
SUM.

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:07.553
A HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION

02:07:07.619 --> 02:07:11.957
ADDITIONAL DOLLARS -- YOU KNOW.

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:17.296
SOME OF WHICH AS I SEE THE NEED --

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.998
FOR YEAH BUT I BUT AGAIN I THINK

02:07:19.064 --> 02:07:20.399
YOU KNOW PORT A PORTION OF THIS

02:07:20.466 --> 02:07:22.301
FORTY POINT THREE TWO AND ROLLED

02:07:22.368 --> 02:07:22.801
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE

02:07:22.868 --> 02:07:24.570
UNDERGRADUATES IN A THOUSAND

02:07:24.636 --> 02:07:25.871
MORE GRADUATE STUDENTS.

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:27.806
AGAIN ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE

02:07:27.873 --> 02:07:30.209
HAD AS WE DON'T YOU GUYS DON'T

02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:30.843
TELL US HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU'RE

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:31.777
IN ROLLING.

02:07:31.844 --> 02:07:33.145
WE GET THOSE NUMBERS AFTER THE

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.847
FACT SO I DON'T KNOW HOW HOW

02:07:34.913 --> 02:07:36.181
MUCH THAT NUMBER'S GOING TO

02:07:36.248 --> 02:07:37.249
CHANGE.

02:07:37.316 --> 02:07:39.251
AND THEN AGAIN I I I SEE THAT

02:07:39.318 --> 02:07:42.321
THE CSU ACTUALLY PROVIDES.

02:07:42.388 --> 02:07:43.188
HAS THE GREATEST POTENTIAL

02:07:43.255 --> 02:07:44.623
PROVIDE MORE MOMENT FOR

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:47.226
UNDERGRADUATES -- AND WITHOUT

02:07:47.292 --> 02:07:49.094
HAVING REALLY DEFINED NUMBERS --

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:50.496
FROM YOU GUYS AND NOT GET IN

02:07:50.562 --> 02:07:52.131
AFTER THE FACT I'M NOT REALLY

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:53.799
COMFORTABLE ADDING ANOTHER FORTY

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:56.101
MILLION DOLLARS. TO THEIR BUDGET

02:07:56.168 --> 02:08:00.005
JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY SAY

02:08:00.072 --> 02:08:02.341

UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO KEEP A

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:11.850
RETAIN -- FACULTY -- I THINK

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:15.354
UNFORTUNATELY AS MY COLLEAGUE --

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:18.390
FROM THE FROM THE SOUTH BAY HAS --

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:19.691
HAS MENTIONED YOU KNOW THERE WAS

02:08:19.758 --> 02:08:21.360
A TIME WHEN WE HAD I THINK A

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:22.828
REALLY HIGH LEVEL.

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:25.931
FACULTY -- QUITE FRANKLY I THINK

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.633
THE STANDARDS HAVE CHANGED --

02:08:27.699 --> 02:08:29.535
AND RIGHT NOW I KNOW YOU EMPLOY

02:08:29.601 --> 02:08:31.270
PROFESSOR UC BERKELEY THE CALLS

02:08:31.336 --> 02:08:33.639
FOR THE UC DAVIS SORRY I DON'T

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:35.574
WANT TO BE SMART BERKELEY -- BUT

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:37.376
UC DAVIS WHO CALLS FOR THE

02:08:37.443 --> 02:08:38.444
KILLING OF COPS.

02:08:38.510 --> 02:08:40.612
AND WHOSE SPECIALTY IS IN CRISIS

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:43.615
THEORY AND THE END OF CAPITALISM --

HIS LATEST BOOK IS RYAN STRIKE

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:46.585
RYAN.

02:08:46.652 --> 02:08:48.754
I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT OUR

02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:50.422
STANDARDS OF FACULTY HAS.

02:08:50.489 --> 02:08:52.558
GROSSLY DEPLETED AT THE UC

02:08:52.624 --> 02:08:55.294

02:08:56.728 --> 02:08:58.097
FACULTY.

02:08:58.163 --> 02:09:00.532
AT THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM BUT

02:09:00.599 --> 02:09:02.901
THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT VERY --

02:09:02.968 --> 02:09:05.471
DISCERNING IN WHO THEY HIRE AND

02:09:05.537 --> 02:09:07.840
AND THE KIND OF EDUCATION THAT I

A STUDENT AT UC ARE AND I DO NOT

02:16:00.085 --> 02:16:01.086
BELIEVE.

02:16:01.152 --> 02:16:03.188
AND I DON'T WANT TO ALLOW TO GO

02:16:03.255 --> 02:16:07.225
BY TO TO SAY THAT THE STATUS OR

02:16:07.292 --> 02:16:10.629
EVEN A BAD WORD STATUE.

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:12.230
OF OF THE PROFESSORS OR THE

02:16:12.297 --> 02:16:15.634
ABILITY OF THOSE PROFESSORS I DO

02:16:15.700 --> 02:16:19.004
NOT THINK HAS DECLINED AT ALL.

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:20.739
AND SO I I DON'T WANNA LET THAT

02:16:20.805 --> 02:16:26.478
GO BY -- WITHOUT COMMENT -- AND

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:32.284
I WANT TO VERY STRONGLY OF ARGUE

02:16:32.350 --> 02:16:34.119

OF WHICH WHICH UC'S ASKING FOR

02:16:41.893 --> 02:16:44.496
AS ONGOING MANY I THINK THAT

02:16:44.563 --> 02:16:46.464
NINETY FIVE MILLION IS ESSENTIAL

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:48.233
TO THE SUCCESS.

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:52.237
OF UC AND THE THE THE THE NINETY

02:16:52.304 --> 02:16:54.105
FIVE MILLION ON GOING TO REPLACE

02:16:54.172 --> 02:16:55.674
ONE TIME FUNDS.

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:58.109
I I I THINK IS A ASCENTIAL AND

02:16:58.176 --> 02:16:59.978
VERY MUCH WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:17:00.045 --> 02:17:01.446
THAT NINETY FIVE MILLION IS

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:02.480
INCLUDED.

02:17:02.547 --> 02:17:08.553
IN THE IN THE BUDGET THIS YEAR.

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:10.055
MISTER CHAIRMAN SURE WE'LL COME

02:17:10.121 --> 02:17:10.555
BACK OUT I I ACTUALLY.

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:12.457
HADN'T QUITE FINISHED YOU KNOW

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:14.492
WHEN AND I AND I AND I DID THE

02:17:14.559 --> 02:17:16.194
FOR BECAUSE I'VE IKNOW YOU

02:17:16.261 --> 02:17:18.129
WANTED TO WRAP THAT UP.

02:17:18.196 --> 02:17:19.631
BUT LOOK AGAIN.

02:17:19.698 --> 02:17:20.999
MY POINT HERE WAS TO USE AN

02:17:21.066 --> 02:17:23.535
EXAMPLE BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:24.569
BEING ASKED TO APPROVE.

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:26.271
IS A FACULTY ACROSS THE BOARD

02:17:26.338 --> 02:17:28.506
FACULTY INCREASES IN SALARIES

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:32.010
RIGHT -- AND I'M IT YOU KNOW

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:33.211
SENT IN THE STATEMENT IS BEING

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:34.579
MADE THE L. WE HAVE THIS WORLD

02:17:34.646 --> 02:17:35.680
CLASS.

02:17:35.747 --> 02:17:38.149
FACULTY ACROSS THE BOARD AND SO

02:17:38.216 --> 02:17:39.618
THEREFORE WE MUST.

02:17:39.684 --> 02:17:40.885
GIVE THIS NINETY FOUR MILLION

02:17:40.952 --> 02:17:43.288
MORE DOLLARS AND I'M JUST USING

02:17:43.355 --> 02:17:45.857
THIS AS ONE EXAMPLE -- ONE IS

02:17:45.924 --> 02:17:47.492
VERY HIGH PROFILE BEEN OUT THERE

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:49.861
IN THE NEWS AND JUST AS TWO

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:51.930
NOBEL LAUREATES AT RIVERSIDE.

02:17:51.997 --> 02:17:53.331
DOESN'T MEAN THAT EVERYBODY

02:17:53.398 --> 02:17:55.000
ACROSS THE BOARD.

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:56.368
IS A NOBEL LAUREATE.

02:17:56.434 --> 02:18:00.572
RIGHT. ONE PERSON AT UC DAVIS

02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:01.172
DOESN'T MEAN THAT ALL OF THEM

02:18:01.239 --> 02:18:02.073
ARE NOT.

02:18:02.140 --> 02:18:04.442
BUT IT PASSED THE VERY BIG

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:05.210
QUESTION.

02:18:05.277 --> 02:18:08.013
OF DO WE TRULY HAVE.

02:18:08.079 --> 02:18:10.882
THIS STELLAR FACULTY IN THE UC

02:18:10.949 --> 02:18:12.784
SYSTEM BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK

02:18:12.851 --> 02:18:13.718
YOU CAN PAINT A BROAD BRUNCH

02:18:13.785 --> 02:18:15.453
BRUSH LIKE THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:17.022
I'M BEING ASKED TO DO.

02:18:17.088 --> 02:18:18.890
BYE BYE BYE APPROVING NINETY

02:18:18.957 --> 02:18:20.125
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:18:20.191 --> 02:18:21.326
INCREASES.

02:18:21.393 --> 02:18:22.794
IN SALARIES BECAUSE IT'S IT'S

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:25.397
OUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY THE BEST.

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:26.831
WELL I JUST GAVE YOU A VERY HIGH

02:18:26.898 --> 02:18:28.867
PROFILE EXAMPLE OF WHY I HAD I

02:18:28.933 --> 02:18:30.902
QUESTION VERY HIGHLY THAT THAT'S

02:18:30.969 --> 02:18:32.604
THE CASE.

02:18:32.671 --> 02:18:34.039
AND I DO THINK IT'S A MAJOR

02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:35.173
ORDEAL.

02:18:35.240 --> 02:18:37.375
WHEN WE HAVE A PROFESSOR CALLING

02:18:37.442 --> 02:18:38.710
FOR THE DEATHS OF ANY GROUP

02:18:38.777 --> 02:18:41.179
PEOPLE GROUP -- I DON'T THINK WE

02:18:41.246 --> 02:18:42.547
WOULD TOLERATE THAT IN MANY

02:18:42.614 --> 02:18:44.416
INSTANCES AND IT SHOULD BE ANY

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.084
DIFFERENT WHEN IT COMES TO COPS.

02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:47.719
WHO PROTECT US EACH AND EVERY

02:18:47.786 --> 02:18:50.789
DAY -- AND YEAH I THINK THAT IS

02:18:50.855 --> 02:18:53.358
BUT THAT WAS ONE OF MANY OTHER

02:18:53.425 --> 02:18:54.659
ISSUES THAT I HAVE.

02:18:54.726 --> 02:18:56.094
YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TALKING

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:57.962
ABOUT THE SALARIES BUT I'M

02:18:58.029 --> 02:18:59.230
TALKING ABOUT MANY OTHER ISSUES

02:18:59.297 --> 02:19:00.832
WHICH I THINK MANY OF US WOULD

02:19:00.899 --> 02:19:02.133
AGREE THERE'S MAJOR PROBLEMS

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:03.568
HERE AND SO.

02:19:03.635 --> 02:19:05.303
WE DON'T NEED TO I THINK WE CAN

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:07.238
AGREE.

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:09.441
JUST RUBBER STAMP WHAT THIS YOU

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:11.409
SEE ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING US

02:19:11.476 --> 02:19:12.777
TO DO WHEN THEY'VE GOT A LOT OF

02:19:12.844 --> 02:19:16.314
PROBLEMS -- SOME AREAS WE MAY

02:19:16.381 --> 02:19:16.948
AGREE.

02:19:17.015 --> 02:19:19.017
BUT SOME AREAS WE MAY DISAGREE

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:20.585
THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM.

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:22.520
THEN WE ALWAYS HAVE A RESPECTFUL

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:25.490
DISAGREEMENT -- MY COLLEAGUE

02:19:25.557 --> 02:19:27.692
FROM RIVERSIDE -- BUT I THINK

02:19:27.759 --> 02:19:29.094
THERE'S MANY AREAS WHERE WE ARE

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.695
AT BERRY MUCH IN AGREEMENT THAT

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:31.963
WE NEED TO SEE IMPROVEMENT AND

02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:33.398
WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO CONTINUE%

02:19:33.465 --> 02:19:34.699
TO ENABLE.

02:19:34.766 --> 02:19:35.934
THAT KIND OFATTITUDE FROM THE

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.102
ADMINISTRATION APPROVED THEIR

02:19:37.168 --> 02:19:39.037
COSTS THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:41.439
SAY.

02:19:41.506 --> 02:19:42.607
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA.

02:19:42.674 --> 02:19:44.709
THANK YOU.

02:19:44.776 --> 02:19:47.812
AND I THINK THAT IT'S YEAH I

02:19:47.879 --> 02:19:49.848
REFLECT TO THE MANY EXAMPLES

02:19:49.914 --> 02:19:52.150
THAT I HAVE -- OVER THE ELEVEN

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:53.017
YEARS THAT I WORKED ON THE CAN'T

02:19:53.084 --> 02:19:56.688
AT UC SANTA BARBARA CAMPUS --

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:58.757
AND ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW THE

02:19:58.823 --> 02:20:01.226
ROLE OF A PROFESSOR AND EVERY

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:03.561
OTHER EMPLOYEE AT THE UNIVERSITY

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:05.663
OF CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED -- NOT

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.499
ONLY HAVE WE SEEN AN INCREASE IN

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.801
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS -- THAT

02:20:09.868 --> 02:20:11.870
WE HAVE AT THE UC -- WE JUST HAD

02:20:11.936 --> 02:20:14.906
A PANEL THAT TALKED ABOUT -- THE

02:20:14.973 --> 02:20:16.474
NEED FOR MORE MENTAL HEALTH

02:20:16.541 --> 02:20:19.177
SERVICES -- AND AN INCREASE IN

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:21.012
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO

02:20:21.079 --> 02:20:25.750
REQUIRE -- A DIFFERENT KIND OF

02:20:25.817 --> 02:20:27.452
ASSISTANCE -- YOU KNOW.

02:20:27.519 --> 02:20:30.522
I A THINK OF ALL THE FACULTY THE

02:20:30.588 --> 02:20:33.258
GRADUATE STUDENTS -- THAT OUR

02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:36.361
LECTURERS OR THAT ARE YEAH.

02:20:36.427 --> 02:20:38.429
D. A.'S AND HOW MUCH EVERY

02:20:38.496 --> 02:20:39.964
SINGLE PERSON WHO WORKS AT THE

02:20:40.031 --> 02:20:43.001
UNIVERSITY HAS HAD TO STEP UP TO

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:46.604
SERVE MORE STUDENTS -- TO DO

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:49.340
DIFFERENT TYPE OF WORK BY -- FOR

02:20:49.407 --> 02:20:51.543
THE NINE YEARS THAT I WORKED ON

02:20:51.609 --> 02:20:54.612
THE CAMPUS I WORKED WITH FACULTY

02:20:54.679 --> 02:20:56.648
WHO WERE NOT PAID TO MENTOR

02:20:56.714 --> 02:20:59.984
STUDENTS WHO MENTORED STUDENTS --

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:02.420
BY ADVISING THEM WELL ABOVE AND

02:21:02.487 --> 02:21:05.223
BEYOND TO BECOME SOME DAY PHD

02:21:05.290 --> 02:21:07.959
STUDENTS -- I A THINK THAT FOR

02:21:08.026 --> 02:21:09.194
ME.

02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.029
I I REALLY REFLECT ON REALLY

02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:13.631
THOUSANDS OF EXAMPLES -- OVER

02:21:13.698 --> 02:21:15.667
ELEVEN YEARS OF WATCHING PEOPLE

02:21:15.733 --> 02:21:18.236
AT THE UC WORKERS AT THE UC GO

02:21:18.303 --> 02:21:20.905
ABOVE AND BEYOND -- I MEAN WE

02:21:20.972 --> 02:21:22.941
THINK OF THE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:25.343
AS PLACES WHERE STUDENTS GO THEY

02:21:25.410 --> 02:21:27.278
HAVE STUDENT ACTIVITIES BAY DO

02:21:27.345 --> 02:21:29.781
EXTRA CURRICULAR SO ALL OF THAT

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:32.016
TAKES STAFF. TO BE INVOLVED ALL

02:21:32.083 --> 02:21:34.752
OF THAT TAKES -- FACULTY TO TRY

02:21:34.819 --> 02:21:36.554
TO SUPPORT US STUDENTS IN

02:21:36.621 --> 02:21:38.389
THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:39.257
IN THE WORLD AND ALSO IN THE

02:21:39.324 --> 02:21:40.091
CLASSROOM.

02:21:40.158 --> 02:21:42.493
I DON'T THINK ANY INSTITUTION

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:45.830
ANY INDUSTRY ANY PROFESSIONAL

02:21:45.897 --> 02:21:49.300
PLACE -- IS ABSENT OF BOTH

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:52.770
AMAZING EXAMPLES AND ALSO SOME

02:21:52.837 --> 02:21:54.239
THAT FALL SHORT SO.

02:21:54.305 --> 02:21:57.041
AT A THINK FOR ME I SEE THAT.

02:21:57.108 --> 02:21:59.744
IF WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE

02:21:59.811 --> 02:22:02.280
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA THAT.

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:03.615
THE METHOD TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:06.217
CONCERNS IS NOT TO DISINVEST

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:08.553
IT'S TO INVEST IN A STRATEGIC

02:22:08.620 --> 02:22:10.154
WAY -- BECAUSE I THINK

02:22:10.221 --> 02:22:12.624
DISINVESTMENT IN OUR HIGHER ED

02:22:12.690 --> 02:22:15.560
SYSTEM IN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO

02:22:15.627 --> 02:22:17.295
WORK IN THE CAMPUS IS ALSO A

02:22:17.362 --> 02:22:19.931
DISINVESTMENT IN THE STUDENTS --

02:22:19.998 --> 02:22:22.000
IT IS TRICKLE DOWN I HAVE SAID

02:22:22.066 --> 02:22:23.501
THIS OVER AND OVER IN THIS

02:22:23.568 --> 02:22:24.602
COMMITTEE OVER THE LAST THREE

02:22:24.669 --> 02:22:26.804
YEARS -- THAT WHENEVER ANY

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:28.273
CONVERSATION IS HAPPENING ABOUT

02:22:28.339 --> 02:22:29.841
IMPERFECTIONS THAT YOU KNOW

02:22:29.908 --> 02:22:31.142
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT IT

02:22:31.209 --> 02:22:32.911
TRICKLES DOWN TO STUDENTS AND I

02:22:32.977 --> 02:22:34.846
CAN TELL YOU THAT BECAUSE I KNOW

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.214
WHAT THOSE BUDGETS LOOK LIKE.

02:22:36.281 --> 02:22:37.749
I HAD TO DEAL WITH BUDGET THAT

02:22:37.815 --> 02:22:39.550
WOULD BE SCALED BACK OR THAT WE

02:22:39.617 --> 02:22:41.319
WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK I WAS ONE

02:22:41.386 --> 02:22:42.720
OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD TO

02:22:42.787 --> 02:22:43.821
DO THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF

02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:46.457
REPORTING -- TO EXPLAIN THE

02:22:46.524 --> 02:22:48.126
SUCCESS OF MY WORK TO SHOW THE

02:22:48.192 --> 02:22:50.128
NEW METRICS THAT THE STATE

02:22:50.194 --> 02:22:52.063
LEGISLATURE WAS ASKING.

02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.964
FOR IT ALL IT I MEAN IN ALSO

02:22:53.031 --> 02:22:54.799
MEANT I WAS DOING MORE REPORTING

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:56.334
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FOLKS WANTED

02:22:56.401 --> 02:22:58.002
US TO DO WE WE DID IT BUT IT

02:22:58.069 --> 02:22:59.504
CERTAINLY MEANT I WAS DOING LAST

02:22:59.570 --> 02:23:02.173
ADVISING I WAS DESK DOING LESS --

02:23:02.240 --> 02:23:03.174
PROGRAMMATIC WORK FOR THE

02:23:03.241 --> 02:23:05.510
STUDENTS THERE ARE REAL TRICKLE

02:23:05.576 --> 02:23:07.712
DOWN A FAX AND I HOPE -- THAT

02:23:07.779 --> 02:23:09.380
ARE ARE COMMITTEE CAN THINK

02:23:09.447 --> 02:23:11.549
ABOUT IF THERE ARE IMPERFECTIONS

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.584
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THEM AND HAD

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.586
WE ALSO FOCUS ON REPLICATING THE

02:23:15.653 --> 02:23:16.821
SUCCESS.

02:23:16.888 --> 02:23:19.123
EVERY SINGLE SPACE THAT WE DEAL

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:20.658
WITH EVERY SINGLE POLICY OR

02:23:20.725 --> 02:23:22.093
BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS FLAWS AND

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:26.297
IF ALL WE FOCUS ON ARE THE FLAWS.

02:23:26.364 --> 02:23:28.800
AND NOT A WAY TO FIX THOSE A

02:23:28.866 --> 02:23:31.202
THINK THAT WE ARE IN TROUBLE --

02:23:31.269 --> 02:23:32.904
WE HAVE A HISTORY OF THIS

02:23:32.971 --> 02:23:36.274
INVESTING IN HIGHER AT THE

02:23:36.341 --> 02:23:37.976
MASTERS IT.

02:23:38.042 --> 02:23:38.743
WE USED TO FIND THE UC.

02:23:38.810 --> 02:23:40.545
AT A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL THAN WE

02:23:40.611 --> 02:23:43.481
DO NOW -- AND I THINK THAT WE

02:23:43.548 --> 02:23:45.016
ALSO CAN SEE TRENDS OF THAT'S

02:23:45.083 --> 02:23:46.718
NOT NECESSARILY HELP TO THE

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:49.120
STUDENTS ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE

02:23:49.187 --> 02:23:50.321
SERVE OR TAXPAYERS.

02:23:50.388 --> 02:23:51.823
SO I THINK I WANT TO OFFER THAT

02:23:51.889 --> 02:23:54.092
PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE IT GETS.

02:23:54.158 --> 02:23:56.294
VERY LOST IN ONLY TALKING ABOUT

02:23:56.361 --> 02:23:57.795
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT -- AND

02:23:57.862 --> 02:23:59.197
NOT SEEN HOW ALL OF OUR

02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:00.865
DECISIONS THAT WERE MAKING ALL

02:24:00.932 --> 02:24:02.500
OF THE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAVING

02:24:02.567 --> 02:24:03.968
TRICKLE DOWN TO EVERY DAY

02:24:04.035 --> 02:24:09.140
STUDENTS AND THE WORKERS THERE.

02:24:09.207 --> 02:24:11.876
OKAY WELL THIS WAS OUR FIRST

02:24:11.943 --> 02:24:13.945
ENGINE ITEM SO WE HAVE A FEW

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:16.748
OTHERS -- TO TO TO GET THROUGH

02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:18.016
THEY TO THE UC I I THINK THE

02:24:18.082 --> 02:24:19.550
CONCLUSION HERE.

02:24:19.617 --> 02:24:22.820
IS -- WE ALL LOVE THE UNIVERSE

02:24:22.887 --> 02:24:24.989
CALIFORNIA FOR PERSONAL INTEREST

02:24:25.056 --> 02:24:27.558
OR FOR CONSTITUENTS -- OFF FOR

02:24:27.625 --> 02:24:31.429
MY COLLEAGUES HERE -- STATE AT

02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:32.463
THE UC DID YOU MISTER TO MEDINA.

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.165
YOU DID AS WELL.

02:24:34.232 --> 02:24:37.201
HI -- I DID NOT -- CERTAINLY MY

02:24:37.268 --> 02:24:39.103
FATHER DID MY WIFE DIDN'T PROUD

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:39.971
OF THAT.

02:24:40.038 --> 02:24:43.307
YOU SEE -- LEGACY IN OUR FAMILY

02:24:43.374 --> 02:24:45.877
AND I THINK IT BOILS DOWN TO ONE

02:24:45.943 --> 02:24:46.444
A GREAT UNIVERSE CALIFORNIA

02:24:46.511 --> 02:24:48.212
SYSTEM FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THIS

02:24:48.279 --> 02:24:50.181
GENERATION THE NEXT.

02:24:50.248 --> 02:24:51.883
BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID.

02:24:51.949 --> 02:24:53.618
WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED MONEY

02:24:53.684 --> 02:24:55.086
AND WE NEED TO BE SMARTER WITH

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:56.721
THE SCARCE RESOURCES WE DO THAT

02:24:56.788 --> 02:24:58.823
FOR HIGHER AT AND I THINK THAT'S

02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:01.159
WHAT WE'RE ARE TRYING TO TO TO

02:25:01.225 --> 02:25:03.694
FOCUS ON EVERY YEAR IN THE

02:25:03.761 --> 02:25:05.997

AND IT'S PART OF THAT DISCUSSION

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:36.420
ASKED THREE QUESTIONS THAT WE

02:26:36.487 --> 02:26:38.723
THINK ARE REALLY THE CORE ISSUES

02:26:38.789 --> 02:26:40.191
HERE IS REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL

02:26:40.258 --> 02:26:42.426
I'LL GO THROUGH EACH CORE ISSUE

02:26:42.493 --> 02:26:42.793
ONE AT A TIME.

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.962
THE FIRST QUESTION THAT THE

02:26:45.029 --> 02:26:46.697
COMMITTEE ****.

02:26:46.764 --> 02:26:47.932
OUT WAS.

STUDENT SUCCESS THAT YOU SEE.

02:26:52.770 --> 02:26:53.471
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT OF

YOUR AGENDA.

02:26:54.138 --> 02:26:56.574
OF THAT TABLE ON THE ON THE PAGE

02:26:56.641 --> 02:26:57.942
THEIR DISPLAYS THAT USE THE MOST

02:26:58.009 --> 02:26:59.343
RECENT ESTIMATES FOR ITS

02:26:59.410 --> 02:27:02.246
GRADUATION RATES FOR ITS

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:04.382
FRESHMEN AND TRANSFER STUDENTS.

02:27:04.448 --> 02:27:05.850
AND AS YOU CAN SEE.

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:07.485
LOOKING BACK FOR YEARS THANKS

02:27:09.587 --> 02:27:12.456
OVER 60% -- LOOKING OUT SIX

YEARS THAT GRADUATION GOES IT

02:27:14.258 --> 02:27:15.793
RATE GOES UP TO OVER 80%.

02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:17.094
I'M LOOKING FOR YOURSELF FOR

02:27:17.161 --> 02:27:20.965
TRANSFER STUDENTS -- IT'S ALSO --

02:27:21.032 --> 02:27:22.800
OVER -- CLOSE 290%.

02:27:22.867 --> 02:27:24.435
THESE RATES ARE AMONG THE HIGH

02:27:24.502 --> 02:27:26.604
OR THE OR OR THE HIGHEST AMONG

02:27:26.671 --> 02:27:28.306
THE STATE'S THREE PUBLIC HIGHER

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:29.540
EDUCATION SEGMENTS ARE THERE ARE

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:31.442
HIGHER THAN CSU AND HIGHER THAN

02:27:31.509 --> 02:27:32.910
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:27:32.977 --> 02:27:34.145
AND THE STATE'S RECOGNIZE THAT

02:27:34.212 --> 02:27:36.047
HISTORICALLY AND IN PAST YEARS

02:27:36.113 --> 02:27:38.249
THE LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:40.751
FUNDING FOR STUDENT SUCCESS.

02:27:40.818 --> 02:27:42.753
AT THE CSU AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:27:42.820 --> 02:27:44.522
SYSTEMS AND FOCUSED ITS

02:27:44.589 --> 02:27:46.123
ATTENTION THAT YOU SEE ON OTHER

02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:47.792
CRITICAL ISSUES THAT THE

02:27:47.858 --> 02:27:49.193
UNIVERSITY FACES THINGS LIKE

02:27:49.260 --> 02:27:50.861
ENSURING ACCESS FOR RESIDENTS

02:27:50.928 --> 02:27:54.065
STUDENTS AND REDUCING OVERALL

02:27:54.131 --> 02:27:56.400
COSTS ARE YOU SEE.

02:27:56.467 --> 02:27:58.469
THIS APPROACH IS REASONABLE.

02:27:58.536 --> 02:28:00.004
THAT'S SAID ONE ISSUE THE

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:01.372
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER

02:28:01.439 --> 02:28:03.241
AS IT'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL

02:28:03.307 --> 02:28:04.942
IS THE DIFFERENT GAPS IN

02:28:05.009 --> 02:28:06.677
GRADUATION RATES BETWEEN

02:28:06.744 --> 02:28:07.845
DIFFERENT GROUPS OF STUDENTS.

02:28:07.912 --> 02:28:08.946
NOW IF YOU LOOK AT AGAIN AT THE

02:28:09.013 --> 02:28:10.548
TABLE ON PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN SEE

02:28:10.615 --> 02:28:12.516
THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES

02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:13.284
BETWEEN.

02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:15.052
NON TELL STUDENTS THOUGH THOSE

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:18.055
DIFFERENCES OF LARGELY GO AWAY

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.223
WHEN SHE LOOKS SIX AND FOUR

02:28:19.290 --> 02:28:21.058
YEARS OUT FOR FRESHMEN AND

02:28:21.125 --> 02:28:22.026
TRANSFER STUDENTS.

02:28:22.093 --> 02:28:24.729
BUT IF YOU TURN THE PAGE TO PAGE.

02:28:24.795 --> 02:28:25.796
NINE YOU WILL SEE DIFFERENCES IN

02:28:25.863 --> 02:28:27.932
GRADUATION RATES ACROSS THE

02:28:27.999 --> 02:28:29.767
DIFFERENT CAMPUSES NOT JUST TO A

02:28:29.834 --> 02:28:31.135
LARGE EXTENT REFLECTS THE

02:28:31.202 --> 02:28:32.503
DIFFERENT ADMISSION.

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.071
RATES AND SELECTIVITY OF THOSE

02:28:34.138 --> 02:28:36.807
CAMPUSES.

02:28:36.874 --> 02:28:38.242
YOU CAN ALSO SEE.

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:38.876
DIFFERENT GRADUATION RATES BY

02:28:38.943 --> 02:28:40.311
RACE AND ETHNICITY LOOKING AT

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:42.747
THE BOTTOM GRAPH ON PAGE.

02:28:42.813 --> 02:28:43.914
NINE AND AS YOU CAN SEE THOSE

02:28:43.981 --> 02:28:45.950
GAPS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY PERSISTENT

02:28:46.017 --> 02:28:47.351
OVER TIME.

02:28:47.418 --> 02:28:48.452
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S ALSO

02:28:48.519 --> 02:28:49.453
PRESENT AT THE OTHER TWO

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:50.821
SEGMENTS IT'S NOT UNIQUE TO YOU

02:28:50.888 --> 02:28:51.989
SEE BUT THE LEGISLATURE OF THE

02:28:52.056 --> 02:28:53.791
LEGISLATURE MAY BE CONCERNED

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:55.493
ABOUT -- THIS PERSISTENT

02:28:55.559 --> 02:28:58.262
GRADUATION AT A GAP BETWEEN THE

02:28:58.329 --> 02:29:00.464
BY BY RACE AND ETHNICITY.

02:29:00.531 --> 02:29:01.198
THE SECOND QUESTION THE

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:02.833
COMMITTEE ASKED WAS WELL HOW

02:29:02.900 --> 02:29:04.035
WERE YOU SEE SPEND THESE FUNDS

02:29:04.101 --> 02:29:05.770
IF IT IF IT WERE APPROPRIATED TO

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:07.305
UNIVERSITY.

02:29:07.371 --> 02:29:08.506
WHEN WE REVIEWS REVIEW THIS

02:29:08.572 --> 02:29:10.341
PROPOSAL THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDE

02:29:10.408 --> 02:29:11.208
A HIGH LEVEL PROVIDED A HIGH

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:12.943
LEVEL NARRATIVE HOW WOULD SPEND

02:29:13.010 --> 02:29:13.944
THE FUNDS BUT WHAT OF MORE

02:29:14.011 --> 02:29:15.212
DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLANS

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:17.048
LACKING?

02:29:17.114 --> 02:29:19.250
NOW I HAVE TO SAY I LOOK THROUGH

02:29:19.317 --> 02:29:21.552
THE HANDOUT THAT YOU SEE A

02:29:21.619 --> 02:29:23.254
RELEASE AND IF YOU GO TO PAGE.

02:29:23.321 --> 02:29:24.488
TEN I I DO SEE AN EXPENDITURE

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.956
PLAN I'M LOOKING AT THIS FOR THE

02:29:26.023 --> 02:29:27.358
FIRST TIME SO OUR OFFICE WOULD

02:29:27.425 --> 02:29:30.261
HAVE TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITY.

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:30.895
TO A DRILL DOWN THESE NUMBERS A

02:29:30.961 --> 02:29:32.596
LITTLE MORE UNDERSTAND THEM AND

02:29:32.663 --> 02:29:33.230
AND PROVIDE A FULLER ASSESSMENT

02:29:33.297 --> 02:29:34.632
OF THEM SO I FORTUNATELY I CAN'T

02:29:34.699 --> 02:29:35.933
COMMENT AT THIS TIME ON THE

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:40.137
EXPENDITURE PLAN BUT I I DO SEE

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:41.739
IT HERE ON ON THIS PAGE.

02:29:41.806 --> 02:29:42.907
THE FINAL QUESTION THE

02:29:42.973 --> 02:29:44.642
LEGISLATURE ASKED WAS WELL.

02:29:44.709 --> 02:29:45.643
HOW WILL WHAT WHAT WHAT

02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:46.944
ACCOUNTABILITY IS IN PLACE HOW

02:29:47.011 --> 02:29:48.612
WE TRACK WHETHER OR NOT THE

02:29:48.679 --> 02:29:50.247
FUNDING MEETS OUR OBJECTIVES?

02:29:50.314 --> 02:29:51.382
THEN WE RECOMMEND THAT THE

02:29:51.449 --> 02:29:52.950
LEGISLATURE ADOPT --

02:29:53.017 --> 02:29:54.118

02:36:28.512 --> 02:36:30.481
NECESSARY TO GO INTO GRADUATE

02:36:30.547 --> 02:36:32.049
SCHOOL AND AS WE ARE TRYING TO

02:36:32.116 --> 02:36:34.318
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PHD IS

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:35.319

MINORITY BACKGROUNDS AND WHO ARE

02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:37.955
WOMEN.

02:36:38.021 --> 02:36:39.423
IT'S NECESSARY FOR THOSE

02:36:39.490 --> 02:36:40.758
STUDENTS TO DEVELOP THOSE

02:36:40.824 --> 02:36:42.092
RELATIONSHIPS DURING THEIR

02:36:42.159 --> 02:36:43.894
UNDERGRADUATE TIMES SO WE ARE

02:36:43.961 --> 02:36:45.429
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE

02:36:45.496 --> 02:36:47.097
TRENDS AND WANT.

02:36:47.164 --> 02:36:49.466
TO LEVEL THEM OFTEN -- BEGIN TO

02:36:49.533 --> 02:36:50.801
REVERSE THEM.

02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:51.635
AND THAT CONCLUDES MY

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:54.037
PRESENTATION ON STUDENT SUCCESS

02:36:54.104 --> 02:36:55.572

02:37:00.744 --> 02:37:02.379
LOT ABOUT THIS AT OUR

02:37:02.446 --> 02:37:04.581
INFORMATIONAL HEARING.

02:37:04.648 --> 02:37:08.552
AND IT IN ESSENCE WE THIS IS AN

02:37:08.619 --> 02:37:10.187
ISSUE AS I SAID EARLIER A BIG

02:37:10.254 --> 02:37:11.321
ISSUE AT THE CSU SYSTEM AND IN

02:37:11.388 --> 02:37:12.790
LARGE PART MOST STUDENTS TO GET

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:14.024
INTO THE UC.

02:37:14.091 --> 02:37:17.027
ARE EXTREMELY WELL QUALIFIED.

02:37:17.094 --> 02:37:18.729
THEY DO WELL.

02:37:18.796 --> 02:37:20.430
THEY GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS IF

02:37:20.497 --> 02:37:21.165
NOT.

02:37:21.231 --> 02:37:23.400
THE FORTY SIX UNDERSTAND THAT

02:37:23.467 --> 02:37:24.802
SIX MAY NOT BE SIX YEARS BUT

02:37:24.868 --> 02:37:26.103
BETWEEN FOUR AND SIX COULD BE

02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:27.871
THEY GRADUATED FOUR AND A HALF

02:37:27.938 --> 02:37:28.806
YEARS.

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:32.042
SO -- WE DO HAVE SOME ISSUES

02:37:32.109 --> 02:37:33.443
THAT SOME OF THE CAMPUSES AND

02:37:33.510 --> 02:37:39.750
YOU SEE HERE AT AT MERCED DIDN'T --

02:37:39.817 --> 02:37:42.786
TO SOME EXTENT RIVERSIDE -- WHAT

02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:43.587
THE AND THE OTHER ISSUES OF

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:44.788
COURSE WITH?

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:46.190
UNDER REPRESENT UNDERREPRESENTED

02:37:46.256 --> 02:37:47.491
MINORITY STUDENTS BUT HOW DO YOU

02:37:47.558 --> 02:37:48.959
TARGET THAT FOR EXAMPLE AT

02:37:49.026 --> 02:37:50.460
BERKELEY WITH THIS FORTY

02:37:50.527 --> 02:37:51.061
THOUSAND STUDENTS AND WE HEARD

02:37:51.128 --> 02:37:52.596
FROM MR EARLIER.

02:37:52.663 --> 02:37:53.297
THE BLACK POPULATION SHE'S.

02:37:53.363 --> 02:37:57.134
IN THE BACKS ONE POINT 6% -- AND

02:37:57.201 --> 02:37:58.535
SO HOW DO YOU YOU KNOW HAVE YOU

02:37:58.602 --> 02:38:00.971
GO AND TARGET THAT IF THAT'S WHO

02:38:01.038 --> 02:38:02.840
YOU'RE TRYING TO REACH.

02:38:02.906 --> 02:38:04.341
WHEREAS IT'S EASIER AND MASS TO

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.343
DO IT FOR EXAMPLE AT MAYBE IT

02:38:06.410 --> 02:38:07.945
CAL STATE LA.

02:38:08.011 --> 02:38:09.746
WERE YOU YEAR STUDENT POPULATION

02:38:09.813 --> 02:38:10.814
IS.

02:38:10.881 --> 02:38:13.984
AB 60% UNDER REPRESENTED

02:38:14.051 --> 02:38:16.186
MINORITY SO I THINK THOSE ARE --

02:38:16.253 --> 02:38:17.988
SOME LOGISTICS ISSUES TOO I KNOW

02:38:18.055 --> 02:38:19.656
WE JUST GOT THE PLAN TODAY I

02:38:19.723 --> 02:38:21.992
THINK THESE THESE OUTREACH

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:23.560
EFFORTS AND HE STARTED EFFORTS

02:38:23.627 --> 02:38:26.129
ARE IMPORTANT -- I THINK IT JUST

02:38:26.196 --> 02:38:27.297
COMES DOWN FOR US AND ANOTHER

02:38:27.364 --> 02:38:28.765
REQUEST WAS HIGHER.

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:30.334
BUT IF THERE IS NO MORE MONEY

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:32.736
COMES ON A REQUEST IT COMES DOWN

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:35.572
TO US -- BALANCING THIS

02:38:35.639 --> 02:38:37.107
PERSISTED ENROLLMENT I MET WITH

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:38.442

THIS PROPOSAL AND THEY SAID

02:38:51.822 --> 02:38:53.557

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:08.405
IF WE HAD UNLIMITED RESOURCES.

02:39:08.472 --> 02:39:10.507

02:40:59.349 --> 02:41:04.087
ON CAMPUSES AND ON HOW THEY DO --

02:41:04.154 --> 02:41:06.823

STUDENTS OF COLOR RIGHT OR THE

02:41:08.592 --> 02:41:11.294
DEGREE OF DIFFERENCE.

02:41:11.361 --> 02:41:12.829
THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES HAVE

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:16.166
SUCCESS THEY HAVE RIGHT THIS

THE ADMINISTRATION'S GOAL.

02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.133
CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WITH THIS

02:45:43.199 --> 02:45:44.634
PROPOSAL.

02:45:44.701 --> 02:45:46.369
THE FIRST ALL THIS PROPOSAL

02:45:46.436 --> 02:45:48.938
LACKS A LOT OF BASIC INFORMATION

02:45:49.005 --> 02:45:50.707
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE

02:45:50.774 --> 02:45:51.875
TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROPOSAL'S

02:45:51.941 --> 02:45:53.443
MEETING ITS OBJECTIVES AND ALSO

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:55.245
TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY PROPOSE

02:45:55.312 --> 02:45:56.713
LEVEL OF FUNDING IS JUSTIFIED.

02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:58.515
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNOR HAS

02:45:58.581 --> 02:46:00.450
PROVIDED A FEW DIFFERENT WAYS

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:02.585
THAT FOR POSSIBILITIES THAT THE

02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:03.753
FUNDS WOULD BE SPENT.

02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:05.889
THE KEY FOCUS SEEMS TO BE DEGREE

02:46:05.955 --> 02:46:08.058
COMPLETION PROGRAMS THOUGH THE

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:10.093
GOVERNOR ALSO WITH OTHER OPTIONS

02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:13.330
SUCH AS MORE CERTIFICATE

02:46:13.396 --> 02:46:14.130

02:46:15.598 --> 02:46:16.533
EACH OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE

02:46:16.599 --> 02:46:17.667
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT GOALS AND

02:46:17.734 --> 02:46:19.302
OBJECTIVES N MIND.

02:46:19.369 --> 02:46:20.036
AND AGAIN WITHOUT A MORE

02:46:20.103 --> 02:46:21.371
DETAILED EXPENDITURE PLAN IT'S

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:23.206
DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHETHER THE

02:46:23.273 --> 02:46:24.207
FIFTEEN MILLION IS IS ALIGNED

02:46:24.274 --> 02:46:26.209
WITH THE COST OF WHAT'S WHAT THE

02:46:26.276 --> 02:46:27.177
GOVERNOR'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE

02:46:27.243 --> 02:46:27.911
HERE.

02:46:27.977 --> 02:46:29.679
AND I I CHECKED THROUGH THE

02:46:29.746 --> 02:46:31.781
POWER POINT AT YOU SEE I DON'T

THANK YOU -- SO ON THE SO THE

02:46:41.858 --> 02:46:43.560
SECOND CONCERN WE HAVE IS EVEN

EVEN WHERE THE LEDGE WHERE THE

02:46:44.561 --> 02:46:45.362
LEGISLATURE TO BE HAVE A BETTER

02:46:45.428 --> 02:46:47.630
SENSE OF EXACTLY HOW THE FUNDS

02:46:47.697 --> 02:46:50.367
WOULD GET SPENT -- THAT ALIGNS

02:46:50.433 --> 02:46:53.236
IT WITH ITS OBJECTIVES.

02:46:53.303 --> 02:46:53.636
WE DON'T THINK THE

02:46:53.703 --> 02:46:54.871
ADMINISTRATION'S MADE A CASE YET

02:46:54.938 --> 02:46:56.473
THAT'S STATE FUNDING IS NEEDED

02:46:56.539 --> 02:46:57.507
TO ACCOMPLISH ITS OBJECTIVE --

02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:59.008

02:46:59.075 --> 02:46:59.976
SELF SUPPORTING ENTERPRISES AND

02:47:00.043 --> 02:47:01.344
AND PART OF THEIR MISSION.

02:47:01.411 --> 02:47:04.848
IS [inaudible]

02:47:04.914 --> 02:47:06.850
TO OF OF MAINTAIN RESERVES THAT

02:47:06.916 --> 02:47:07.417
IT THAT THE USE TO FIND THE

02:47:07.484 --> 02:47:08.918
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

02:47:08.985 --> 02:47:11.187
PROGRAMS THAT ARE -- HAVE A

02:47:11.254 --> 02:47:13.289
POTENTIAL OF A MARKETABILITY AND

02:47:13.356 --> 02:47:15.191
AND CAN ATTRACT A SUFFICIENT

02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:15.759
NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO COVER

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:17.327
COSTS.

THIRD AS STAFF IN YOUR GENDER

YOUR DEGREE COMPLETION PROGRAMS%

02:47:24.734 --> 02:47:25.802
AND THIS RAISES FURTHER

02:47:25.869 --> 02:47:28.037
QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE WELL THE

02:47:28.104 --> 02:47:29.939

02:47:30.006 --> 02:47:31.541
DUPLICATIVE WITH THE CSU PROGRAM

02:47:31.608 --> 02:47:34.077
WOULD -- COVER AN ADDITIONAL

02:47:34.144 --> 02:47:35.378
NEED THAT CSU WASN'T COVERING.

02:47:35.445 --> 02:47:36.846

SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS

02:48:15.785 --> 02:48:17.353
HAVE LEFT THE UC WITHOUT A

02:48:17.420 --> 02:48:18.354
DEGREE.

02:48:18.421 --> 02:48:19.656
ONLY ABOUT A FOURTH OF THE

STUDENTS OUT THERE WHO NEVER

02:48:25.361 --> 02:48:26.629

HUNDRED AND TWENTY UNITS.

FOR FOR MOST INDIVIDUALS IT

02:50:55.511 --> 02:50:57.547

THAT WOULD -- PAY THEM BETTER

02:51:10.093 --> 02:51:12.695
THAN NOT HAVING A HIGHER DEGREE

02:51:12.762 --> 02:51:14.797

PIECE OF THIS OF THIS MUCH

LARGER PLAN THANK YOU

02:53:08.211 --> 02:53:10.580
THANK YOU.

02:53:10.646 --> 02:53:12.849
WE HAVE THREE ISSUES FOR THE

02:53:12.915 --> 02:53:15.118
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AS IT'S

02:53:15.184 --> 02:53:16.652
REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL.

02:53:16.719 --> 02:53:18.488
THE FIRST ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS

02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:21.157
THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN OUT

02:53:21.224 --> 02:53:23.526
SOMEWHAT -- TO DECIDE WHETHER

02:53:23.593 --> 02:53:27.163
FUNDING FIND MORE FINANCIAL AID

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:29.599
FOR FOOD AND HOUSING INITIATIVES --

02:53:29.665 --> 02:53:31.100
WOULD THAT SOLVE THE ISSUE AND

02:53:31.167 --> 02:53:32.869
IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE REGENTS

02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:36.139
HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH.

02:53:36.205 --> 02:53:37.240
OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT.

02:53:37.306 --> 02:53:40.409
UNDERSTOOD THE UNDERLYING CAUSES --

02:53:40.476 --> 02:53:42.678
BEHIND WHY STUDENTS.

02:53:42.745 --> 02:53:43.579
DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE ENOUGH

02:53:43.646 --> 02:53:45.681
RESOURCES -- TO PURCHASING OF

02:53:45.748 --> 02:53:48.651
FOOD OR FACING FOOD AND SECURITY --

02:53:48.718 --> 02:53:51.020
ARE NOT ENTIRELY WELL UNDERSTOOD

02:53:51.087 --> 02:53:52.421
THE UNIVERSITY HAS A

02:53:52.488 --> 02:53:53.956
COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID

02:53:54.023 --> 02:53:55.458
PROGRAMS THAT.

02:53:55.525 --> 02:53:57.226
CONSIDERS THE COST OF ATTENDANCE

02:53:57.293 --> 02:53:59.128
AND MAKING FINANCIALLY DECISIONS

02:53:59.195 --> 02:53:59.729
AND SO THERE'S SOME QUESTION

02:53:59.796 --> 02:54:01.931
HERE ABOUT WHAT ISN'T WORKING IN

02:54:01.998 --> 02:54:03.166
TERMS OF THAT FINANCIALLY

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.200
PROGRAM.

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:06.269
ARE WE MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT --

02:54:06.335 --> 02:54:07.436
HOW MUCH STUDENTS WORK AND

02:54:07.503 --> 02:54:09.405
BORROW AND HOW MUCH FAMILIES

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:10.873
CONTRIBUTE TO COSTS?

02:54:10.940 --> 02:54:13.042
ARE WE MISS MEASURING WHAT THE

02:54:13.109 --> 02:54:15.711
COST OF ATTENDANCE IS A REASONS

02:54:15.778 --> 02:54:17.079
QUESTIONS LIKE THAT.

02:54:17.146 --> 02:54:18.214
AND PRESUMABLY THE UNDERLYING

02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:20.850
CAUSES BEHIND -- FOOD AND

02:54:20.917 --> 02:54:23.152
SECURITY WOULD DETERMINE WHICH

02:54:23.219 --> 02:54:25.054
APPROACH WOULD BE MOST TARGETED

02:54:25.121 --> 02:54:25.655
AND MOST EFFECTIVE IN DEALING

02:54:25.721 --> 02:54:28.124
WITH THE ISSUE SO FOR EXAMPLE IF

02:54:28.191 --> 02:54:28.858
THE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT

02:54:28.925 --> 02:54:30.526
STUDENTS JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:54:30.593 --> 02:54:33.629
RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO

02:54:33.696 --> 02:54:34.564
TO COVER FOOD COSTS.

02:54:34.630 --> 02:54:35.998
LIKELY THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

02:54:36.065 --> 02:54:37.733
ADDRESS THAT WOULD BE TO PROVIDE

02:54:37.800 --> 02:54:39.202
THE STUDENTS MORE MONEY.

02:54:39.268 --> 02:54:40.102
TYPICALLY WE DO THAT THROUGH

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.804
FINANCIAL AID -- SOMETIMES WE

02:54:41.871 --> 02:54:42.538
ALSO DO THAT THE PUBLIC

02:54:42.605 --> 02:54:44.140
ASSISTANCE IN THE CASE OF A

02:54:44.207 --> 02:54:46.042
COLLEGE STUDENT.

02:54:46.108 --> 02:54:47.810
ALTERNATIVELY A STUDENTS FACED A

02:54:47.877 --> 02:54:49.545
FINANCIAL EMERGENCY IN THEM IN

02:54:49.612 --> 02:54:50.213
THE MIDDLE OF THE YEAR SAY OFF A

02:54:50.279 --> 02:54:52.782
FAMILY MEMBER LOSES A JOB OR

02:54:52.849 --> 02:54:54.250
THERE'S SOME SORT OF A HEALTH

02:54:54.317 --> 02:54:56.252
EMERGENCY THAT COMES UP THAT

02:54:56.319 --> 02:54:57.520
INCREASES THEIR COSTS.

02:54:57.587 --> 02:54:58.821
WILL FINANCIALLY PROGRAM MIGHT

02:54:58.888 --> 02:55:00.122
NOT BE RESPONSIVE ENOUGH TO

02:55:00.189 --> 02:55:02.124
ADDRESS THE STUDENTS AND THAT'S

02:55:02.191 --> 02:55:05.094
WHERE SOMETHING MAYBE LIKE A

02:55:05.161 --> 02:55:08.097
FOOD BANK FOR EXAMPLE COULD.

02:55:08.164 --> 02:55:10.233
ADDRESS OUR MORE IMMEDIATE NEEDS

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:11.167
WHAT A FURTHER UNDERSTANDING.

02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:12.068
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IT IT'S

02:55:12.134 --> 02:55:12.602
DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER

02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:14.637
INCREASING FINANCIAL AID

02:55:14.704 --> 02:55:16.505
INCREASING -- ON CAMPUS FOOD

02:55:16.572 --> 02:55:18.741
INITIATIVES WHICH OF THOSE WOULD

02:55:18.808 --> 02:55:20.977
BE MOST EFFECTIVE.

02:55:21.043 --> 02:55:23.145
THE SECOND ISSUE FOR THE

02:55:23.212 --> 02:55:24.380
LEGISLATURE CONSIDER IS THAT.

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:25.648
THE LEGISLATURE STILL

02:55:25.715 --> 02:55:26.883
UNDERSTANDING OF THE VARIOUS

02:55:26.949 --> 02:55:28.484
WAYS THE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE

02:55:28.551 --> 02:55:30.820
PROGRAMS INTERACT WITH COLLEGE

02:55:30.887 --> 02:55:33.389
STUDENTS -- IT APPEARS THAT

02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:34.724
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY AS A LARGE

02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:36.025
NUMBER OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT

02:55:36.092 --> 02:55:38.294
YOU SEE WHO COULD QUALIFY FOR

02:55:38.361 --> 02:55:39.996
FOOD BENEFITS.

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:41.464
YOU SEE REPORTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT

02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:42.932
AND WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS

02:55:42.999 --> 02:55:44.400
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ROLLED

02:55:44.467 --> 02:55:45.735
OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS ON

02:55:45.801 --> 02:55:47.270
THE CAL FRESH THAT SUGGESTS

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:48.404
THERE THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A

02:55:48.471 --> 02:55:50.306
LARGE POOL OF STUDENTS THAT WE

02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:52.341
WERE THAT -- QUALIFIED FOR

02:55:52.408 --> 02:55:53.309
CALIFORNIA MEAN ON AVERAGE BEEN

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:54.510
RECEIVING THEM FOR WE DON'T HAVE

02:55:54.577 --> 02:55:55.878
GOOD COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON HOW

02:55:55.945 --> 02:55:58.514
MANY STUDENTS MIGHT QUALIFY FOR

02:55:58.581 --> 02:55:59.849
CAL FRESH BENEFITS.

02:55:59.916 --> 02:56:00.983
THE THIRD ISSUE FOR THE

02:56:01.050 --> 02:56:02.351
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER.

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:04.921
IS ONE OF A KIND OF AN EQUITY

02:56:04.987 --> 02:56:06.289
ISSUE BETWEEN THE THREE SEGMENTS

02:56:06.355 --> 02:56:07.857
AND I THIS COMMITTEE HAS

02:56:07.924 --> 02:56:08.791
DISCUSSED THE SOMEONE IN THE

02:56:08.858 --> 02:56:10.426
PAST -- CURRENTLY THE STATE

02:56:10.493 --> 02:56:12.028
PROVIDES THE MOST AMOUNT OF

02:56:12.094 --> 02:56:13.930
FUNDING FOR LIVING COSTS TO YOU

02:56:13.996 --> 02:56:15.364

STUDENTS AT CSU AND COMMUNITY

02:56:19.669 --> 02:56:22.104
COLLEGES.

02:56:22.171 --> 02:56:23.139
AND THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING A

02:56:23.205 --> 02:56:24.640
ONGOING FUNDING AT YOU SEE ONLY

02:56:24.707 --> 02:56:26.375
SO THAT TO SOME EXTENT THIS

02:56:26.442 --> 02:56:27.810
PROPOSAL FURTHER EXACERBATES

02:56:27.877 --> 02:56:30.479
THAT IN EQUITY.

02:56:30.546 --> 02:56:31.881
GIVEN THESE ISSUES WE HAVE A

02:56:31.948 --> 02:56:33.049
NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS ON OF

02:56:33.115 --> 02:56:34.850
THE LEGISLATURE TO FURTHER STUDY

02:56:34.917 --> 02:56:36.085
THESE ISSUES FURTHER STUDY THE

02:56:36.152 --> 02:56:38.087
UNDERLYING CAUSES FURTHER STUDY

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:39.789
HOW PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.023
WORK AND GET SOME ADDITIONAL

02:56:41.090 --> 02:56:43.793
INFORMATION.

02:56:43.859 --> 02:56:44.760
NOW OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS TO

02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:45.761
DECIDE HOW TO APPROPRIATE

02:56:45.828 --> 02:56:47.396
FUNDING IN TWENTY NINETEEN

02:56:47.463 --> 02:56:49.365
TWENTY AND FURTHER STUDYING THE

02:56:49.432 --> 02:56:50.266

CHALLENGES FROM THE FIRST DAY

03:03:23.659 --> 03:03:24.693
THAT THE STUDENT STARTS IN THE

03:03:24.760 --> 03:03:26.428

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:28.864
WE ARE AS YOU ALL HAVE SEEN YOU

03:03:30.232 --> 03:03:32.634
ACTUALLY INCREASES AS YOU STAY

03:03:32.701 --> 03:03:33.902
IN THE UNIVERSITY FIRST YEAR

03:03:33.969 --> 03:03:35.904
HOMELESSNESS RATES IS ABOUT 3%.

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:38.273
AND LAST YEAR RATES ARE ABOUT

03:03:38.340 --> 03:03:40.609
15% SO WE WANTED TO INTERVENTION

03:03:40.676 --> 03:03:45.247
STRATEGIES TO FLIP THAT ALL THE

03:03:45.314 --> 03:03:47.383
ART SO THAT IT STARTS AT A

03:03:47.449 --> 03:03:48.050
HIGHER RATE THAT WE DON'T GET WE

03:03:48.117 --> 03:03:49.518
DON'T CONTROL STUDENTS COME IN

03:03:49.585 --> 03:03:50.319
ALREADY EXPERIENCING HOUSES

03:03:50.386 --> 03:03:50.786
THAT'S HOMELESSNESS.

WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT

03:10:22.811 --> 03:10:24.012

MENTION A LOT OF PAPERWORK BUT

03:12:15.290 --> 03:12:17.325
WHY WHY IF IF THE STUDENTS CAN

03:12:17.392 --> 03:12:18.660
GET FOOD.

03:12:18.727 --> 03:12:21.696
WHY WHY ARE THEY APPLYING FOR

THAT COMES UP FOR STUDENTS IS

03:12:30.038 --> 03:12:31.439
THAT.

03:12:31.506 --> 03:12:33.842
SOME STUDENTS APPLY ON THEIR OWN

03:12:33.909 --> 03:12:35.277
AND THEY HAVE REALLY CHALLENGING

03:12:35.343 --> 03:12:37.612
EXPERIENCES ON THEIR OWN SO THEN

03:12:37.679 --> 03:12:39.214
THEY TELL OTHER STUDENTS THAT IS

03:12:39.281 --> 03:12:40.682
NOT WORTH IT TO APPLY.

03:12:40.749 --> 03:12:41.883
BECAUSE THERE'S NEW TECHNOLOGY

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:43.885
NOW THAT FACILITIES THAT PROCESS

03:12:43.952 --> 03:12:45.654
AND SENSE OF THE NEW FUNDING

03:12:45.720 --> 03:12:46.588
THAT WE RECEIVE FROM YACHT NOW

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:48.723
THEIR STAFFING ON CAMPUS. TO

03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:49.557
GUIDE STUDENTS SPECIFICALLY

03:12:49.624 --> 03:12:50.458
THROUGH IT SO NOW YOU'RE

03:12:50.525 --> 03:12:51.893
STARTING TO SEE THE NUMBERS

03:12:51.960 --> 03:12:54.029
INCREASE THERE'S ALSO THE HUGE

03:12:54.095 --> 03:12:56.665
CONVERSATION OF STUDENTS KNOWING

03:12:56.731 --> 03:12:57.565
THAT THEY NEED TO COME IN TO

03:12:57.632 --> 03:12:59.301
SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND GO

03:12:59.367 --> 03:13:00.235
THROUGH THE PROCESS.

03:13:00.302 --> 03:13:01.970
A LOT OF STUDENTS UNFORTUNATELY

03:13:02.037 --> 03:13:03.872
THE COUNTY STILL LEARNING HOW TO

03:13:03.939 --> 03:13:04.839
WORK WITH STUDENTS.

03:13:04.906 --> 03:13:06.174
SO IN ORDER FOR YOU TO GET CAO

03:13:06.241 --> 03:13:07.609
FRESH YOU DON'T JUST APPLY YOU

03:13:07.676 --> 03:13:08.143
ALSO HAVE TO COMPLETE AN

03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:08.977
INTERVIEW.

03:13:09.044 --> 03:13:10.245
AND THAT PHONE INTERVIEW

03:13:10.312 --> 03:13:11.980
SOMETIMES THEY GET PHONE CALLS

03:13:12.047 --> 03:13:12.614
FROM THE COUNTY AND THEY'RE IN

03:13:12.681 --> 03:13:14.983
CLASS OR THERE AND WORK AND THEY

03:13:15.050 --> 03:13:16.184
MISS THAT PHONE CALL AND IT'S

03:13:16.251 --> 03:13:17.886
REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO MAKE UP

03:13:17.953 --> 03:13:18.853
THAT PHONE CALL.

03:13:18.920 --> 03:13:20.455
SO THEY HEAR ABOUT THOSE HORROR

03:13:20.522 --> 03:13:22.290
STORIES VERY SIMILAR TO STUDENT

03:13:22.357 --> 03:13:24.326
LOANS WHEN MANY OF OUR STUDENTS

03:13:24.392 --> 03:13:24.893
WHEN THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT

03:13:24.960 --> 03:13:27.729
COLLEGE THEY HEAR ABOUT A

03:13:27.796 --> 03:13:28.363
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A LOAN

03:13:28.430 --> 03:13:29.097
DEBT.

03:13:29.164 --> 03:13:29.764
AND THAT KEEPS THEM FROM

03:13:29.831 --> 03:13:31.666
ACCEPTING THE ONE THOUSAND

03:13:31.733 --> 03:13:32.734
DOLLARS LOAN THAT THEY NEED

03:13:32.801 --> 03:13:34.102
BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IT'S

03:13:34.169 --> 03:13:35.470
GOING TO ESCALATE TO THAT LEVEL

03:13:35.537 --> 03:13:36.504
THERE'S A LOT OF MISINFORMATION

03:13:36.571 --> 03:13:37.906
THAT WERE CLEANING UP.

03:13:37.973 --> 03:13:39.107
THE GOOD THING NOW IS THAT OUR

03:13:39.174 --> 03:13:40.442
FINANCIAL AID OFFICES ARE

03:13:40.508 --> 03:13:41.409
STARTING TO SEND OUT TEXT

03:13:41.476 --> 03:13:42.877
MESSAGES TO STUDENTS AND SAYING

03:13:42.944 --> 03:13:45.146

ON CAMPUS THAT CAN HELP YOU.

03:13:47.983 --> 03:13:49.217
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU'RE SEEING

03:13:49.284 --> 03:13:50.919
THEIR NUMBER STARTING TO GO UP.

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:54.255
I MADE IT IT SEEMS TO MAKE A LOT

03:13:54.322 --> 03:13:56.124
OF SENSE TO ME THAT WE IN A HOME

03:13:56.191 --> 03:13:56.891
WE WOULD WOULD WOULD PROVIDE

03:13:56.958 --> 03:13:58.426
SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE

03:13:58.493 --> 03:14:00.428

03:14:11.840 --> 03:14:12.874
AND THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:14:12.941 --> 03:14:14.309
BENEFITS THAN THEY SHOULD.

A COMPREHENSIVE LIST WE HAVE A

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:49.484
FEW THOUGHTS ON REPORTING

ONE ISSUE THAT A WE DID REYES

03:19:01.996 --> 03:19:02.930
SPECIFICALLY FOR DEFERRED

03:19:02.997 --> 03:19:03.731

03:20:50.538 --> 03:20:53.808
FIRST -- WE HAVE PROVIDED THE

03:20:53.875 --> 03:20:55.143
COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS SOME

03:20:55.209 --> 03:20:57.178
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FOUR POINT

03:20:57.245 --> 03:20:58.513
FOUR BILLION DOLLAR.

03:20:58.579 --> 03:21:01.015
OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG

03:21:01.082 --> 03:21:02.984
IF WE DON'T CONTINUE TO ADDRESS

03:21:03.050 --> 03:21:05.720
THAT -- IT'S NOT GOING TO GET

03:21:05.787 --> 03:21:07.755
ANY SMALLER -- AND IT MIGHT EVEN

03:21:07.822 --> 03:21:10.591
GROW UP MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS --

03:21:10.658 --> 03:21:12.293
APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE CAMPUS

03:21:12.360 --> 03:21:14.429
BUILDINGS ARE OVER THIRTY YEARS

03:21:14.495 --> 03:21:16.397
IN AGE AND WE'RE REACHING THAT

03:21:16.464 --> 03:21:17.965
POINT WHERE WE'RE SEEING A LOT

03:21:18.032 --> 03:21:20.301
OF MAJOR SYSTEMS FAILING THIS IS

03:21:20.368 --> 03:21:22.537
PART OF THE REASON WHY -- THE

03:21:22.603 --> 03:21:24.005
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG IS

03:21:24.071 --> 03:21:26.841
GROWING SO RAPIDLY ALSO -- WE

03:21:26.908 --> 03:21:29.410
USED TO HAVE A STATE DEFERRED

03:21:29.477 --> 03:21:31.012
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR YOU SEE

03:21:31.078 --> 03:21:33.781
WAY BACK BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY

03:21:33.848 --> 03:21:34.282
FOUR THERE WAS A STEADY

03:21:34.348 --> 03:21:36.250
APPROPRIATION ANNUALLY OF TWENTY

03:21:36.317 --> 03:21:37.552
MILLION DOLLARS TO DO

03:21:37.618 --> 03:21:39.120
MAINTENANCE ON THE CAMPUSES.

03:21:39.187 --> 03:21:40.788
DUE TO SOME BUDGETARY PRESSURES

03:21:40.855 --> 03:21:43.224
THAT WAS ENDED -- AND THE

03:21:43.291 --> 03:21:45.293
RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUNDING THE

03:21:45.359 --> 03:21:46.627
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WAS SHIFTED

03:21:46.694 --> 03:21:48.830
ON THAT THE CAMPUS US NOW -- THE

03:21:48.896 --> 03:21:51.666
LEGISLATURE HAS AGAIN TURN THIS

03:21:51.732 --> 03:21:54.268
AROUND -- SINCE. TWENTY FOURTEEN

03:21:54.335 --> 03:21:55.703
YOU BEEN PROVIDING US -- WITH

03:21:55.770 --> 03:21:57.572
ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS

03:21:57.638 --> 03:21:59.040
OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG

03:21:59.106 --> 03:22:00.741
BUT DURING THAT TIME.

03:22:00.808 --> 03:22:02.109
WHEN THE CAMPUSES WERE

03:22:02.176 --> 03:22:03.644
RESPONSIBLE FOR RE DIRECTING

03:22:03.711 --> 03:22:05.346
SOME OF THEIR OPERATIONAL

03:22:05.413 --> 03:22:07.482

MAINTENANCE THOSE -- PROJECTS

03:22:09.884 --> 03:22:12.186
STARTED TO PILE UP AND THEY SER

03:22:12.253 --> 03:22:14.388
RE TO CRITICAL POINT WHERE --

03:22:14.455 --> 03:22:16.324
SYSTEMS NEED TO BE REPLACED ON

03:22:16.390 --> 03:22:17.959
SOME OF THESE OLDER BUILDINGS WE

03:22:18.025 --> 03:22:19.627
ARE REQUESTING THIS COMMITTEE

03:22:19.694 --> 03:22:20.895

OF UC BERKELEY AS AS IS MY MY

03:23:48.049 --> 03:23:48.683

UNDERSTANDING IT'S OF YOUR FOUR

03:23:58.359 --> 03:23:59.827
BILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG BERKELEY

03:23:59.894 --> 03:24:01.896
REPRESENTS ONE OF YOUR TEN

03:24:01.963 --> 03:24:02.964
CAMPUSES.

03:24:03.030 --> 03:24:05.032
WILL NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES

03:24:05.099 --> 03:24:06.434
IT'S SOMETHING LIKE WELL OVER

03:24:06.500 --> 03:24:08.836
HALF 50% MAYBE TWO THIRDS OF

03:24:08.903 --> 03:24:10.838
ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION

03:24:10.905 --> 03:24:11.539
YES YEAH [inaudible]

03:24:11.606 --> 03:24:17.011
YEAH SO. HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE

03:24:17.078 --> 03:24:18.879
WHAT IS A HUNDRED YEAH HUNDRED

03:24:18.946 --> 03:24:22.116
AND SOME MILLION A YEAR.

03:24:22.183 --> 03:24:23.551
ISN'T GOING TO CUT IT.

03:24:23.618 --> 03:24:25.219
AND THE CITY BUILDINGS ARE

03:24:25.286 --> 03:24:26.854
REALLY OLD HI MISSY BURKE WAS AN

03:24:26.921 --> 03:24:28.255
OLD CAMPUS NOT JUST BERKELEY PER

03:24:28.322 --> 03:24:30.758
SE BUT WHAT'S OUR OVERALL.

03:24:30.825 --> 03:24:34.962
PLAN TO MAKE SURE WE MAKE SURE

03:24:35.029 --> 03:24:37.932
OUR CAMPUSES ARE NUMBER ONE SAFE

03:24:37.999 --> 03:24:40.034
FOR STUDENTS.

03:24:40.101 --> 03:24:41.736
IN THOSE OLD BUILDINGS. FOR

03:24:41.802 --> 03:24:42.670
EXAMPLE ON A FAULT LINE IN

03:24:42.737 --> 03:24:43.404
BERKELEY.

03:24:43.471 --> 03:24:46.540
BUT BASICALLY AT HERE TO THE

03:24:46.607 --> 03:24:48.009
EDUCATION STANDARDS WE NEED FOR

03:24:48.075 --> 03:24:49.443
STUDENTS.

03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:51.245
ARE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

03:24:51.312 --> 03:24:53.614
CONDUCTING A SEISMIC -- SAFETY

03:24:53.681 --> 03:24:55.216
ASSESSMENT OF OUR BUILDINGS

03:24:55.282 --> 03:24:57.385
WHICH WILL REVEAL MORE ABOUT

03:24:57.451 --> 03:24:57.918
WHICH BUILDINGS ARE HIGH

03:24:57.985 --> 03:24:59.820
PRIORITY PARTLY BECAUSE CODES

03:24:59.887 --> 03:25:01.288
HAVE CHANGED AND SOME OF THE

03:25:01.355 --> 03:25:02.723
BUILDINGS HAVE GOTTEN OLDER SO

03:25:02.790 --> 03:25:04.392
THEY ARE NO LONGER --

03:25:04.458 --> 03:25:06.394
POTENTIALLY ABLE TO WITHSTAND

03:25:06.460 --> 03:25:09.997
SOME -- MORE INTENSE EARTHQUAKE

03:25:10.064 --> 03:25:11.032
SO WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF

03:25:11.098 --> 03:25:12.500
CONDUCTING AN ASSESSMENT THAT

03:25:12.566 --> 03:25:13.868
SHOULD TELL US MORE ABOUT

03:25:13.934 --> 03:25:15.269
WHETHER OR NOT BUILDINGS NEED TO

03:25:15.336 --> 03:25:18.339
BE REINFORCED OR TORN DOWN --

03:25:18.406 --> 03:25:20.074
BUT IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING THE

03:25:20.141 --> 03:25:22.276
BACKLOG WE THINK THAT WE NEED TO

03:25:22.343 --> 03:25:24.745
TREAT OUR CAMPUSES EQUALLY AND

03:25:24.812 --> 03:25:26.947
PROVIDE THEM WITH -- WHICH

03:25:27.014 --> 03:25:27.782
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MONEY THAT

03:25:27.848 --> 03:25:29.050
REFLECTS THE AGE OF THEIR

03:25:29.116 --> 03:25:30.951
BUILDINGS BUT THAT PROVIDES

03:25:31.018 --> 03:25:32.386
EVERY CAMPUS WITH SOME FUNDS SO

03:25:32.453 --> 03:25:34.088
THAT THEY CAN ADDRESS THEIR MOST

03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:37.224
CRITICAL PROJECTS.

03:25:37.291 --> 03:25:39.160
WHEN WHEN CERTAIN PROJECTS LIKE

03:25:39.226 --> 03:25:40.261
ROOF REPLACEMENTS AREN'T

03:25:40.327 --> 03:25:41.162
ADDRESSED?

03:25:41.228 --> 03:25:42.563
AND THE WATER STARTS GETTING

03:25:42.630 --> 03:25:44.965
INTO THE WALLS TO PROJECTS THEN

03:25:45.032 --> 03:25:46.033
BECOME FAR MORE EXPENSIVE.

03:25:46.100 --> 03:25:48.969
SO IT IT IS CHEAPER TO TAKE CARE

03:25:49.036 --> 03:25:51.505
OF SOME PROJECTS ON THE ON THE

03:25:51.572 --> 03:25:54.208
FRONT END YOU KNOW DO SOME.

03:25:54.275 --> 03:25:56.677
DO SOME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SO

03:25:56.744 --> 03:25:58.212
THAT DOESN'T GET WORSE LATER ON

03:25:58.279 --> 03:25:59.814
ARE THERE OTHER ALTERNATIVE

03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:01.182
FUNDS THAT THE CAMERAS ARE

03:26:01.248 --> 03:26:02.650
LOOKING AT TO ADDRESS THEIR

03:26:02.717 --> 03:26:04.752
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IT.

03:26:04.819 --> 03:26:07.421
THE ISSUE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THIS

03:26:07.488 --> 03:26:08.889
PART ON AND OFF COMING OUT OF

03:26:08.956 --> 03:26:09.490
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EVERY

03:26:09.557 --> 03:26:11.859
YEAR FROM THE BUDGET PROCESS.

03:26:11.926 --> 03:26:13.394
THE UNIVERSITY HAS A SERIES OF

03:26:13.461 --> 03:26:16.330
FUNDS THAT WE USE -- TO MANAGE

03:26:16.397 --> 03:26:18.299
OUR CORE BUDGET OPERATIONS

03:26:18.365 --> 03:26:20.501
OBVIOUSLY NON RESIDENT TUITION

03:26:20.568 --> 03:26:21.602
IS ONE OF THEM.

03:26:21.669 --> 03:26:23.871
AND IF CAMPUSES WERE ABLE TO

03:26:23.938 --> 03:26:25.606
GROW NON RESIDENTS THEY WOULD BE

03:26:25.673 --> 03:26:26.774
ABLE TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL

03:26:26.841 --> 03:26:30.544
REVENUE DOC WAY BUT I KNOW.

03:26:30.611 --> 03:26:34.115
WE HAVE RECEIVED.

03:26:34.181 --> 03:26:35.950
NO NO NO.

03:26:36.016 --> 03:26:36.851
BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED DIRECTION

03:26:36.917 --> 03:26:38.018
FROM THIS COMMITTEE THAT IS NOT

03:26:38.085 --> 03:26:39.754
YOUR PREFERRED FULL ROUTE SO WE

03:26:39.820 --> 03:26:40.488
WILL.

03:26:40.554 --> 03:26:42.356
NOT GO THERE YEAH BUT ALL

03:26:42.423 --> 03:26:44.258
SERIOUSNESS IT IS A MAJOR ISSUE

03:26:44.325 --> 03:26:45.259
IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS WERE.

03:26:45.326 --> 03:26:47.161
YOU KNOW.

03:26:47.228 --> 03:26:50.197
GOD FORBID THERE'S SOME TRAGEDY

03:26:50.264 --> 03:26:51.465
WE'VE TO WAKE UP TO LIKE WE SEE

03:26:51.532 --> 03:26:51.832
WITH.

03:26:51.899 --> 03:26:55.102
FLOODS AND AND EARTHQUAKES.%

03:26:55.169 --> 03:26:57.905
NATURAL DISASTERS WITH ON THAT

03:26:57.972 --> 03:27:01.208
TO HAPPEN -- BUT YOU KNOW

03:27:01.275 --> 03:27:02.009
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VERY OLD

03:27:02.076 --> 03:27:03.711
CAMPUS BUT YOU KNOW ACROSS THE

03:27:03.778 --> 03:27:05.713
NATION THERE THERE THIS I'M SURE

03:27:05.780 --> 03:27:06.313
THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE TO ALL OF

03:27:06.380 --> 03:27:07.414
OUR OLDER UNIVERSITIES ON THE

03:27:07.481 --> 03:27:08.549
EAST COAST HOW ARE THEY DEALING

03:27:08.616 --> 03:27:10.918
WITH THEIR DIFFERENT MEANS

03:27:10.985 --> 03:27:11.385
ISSUES THAT THE PUBLIC

03:27:11.452 --> 03:27:11.719
UNIVERSITIES.

03:27:11.786 --> 03:27:13.387
I'M NOT CERTAIN HOW OTHER PUBLIC

03:27:13.454 --> 03:27:14.855
UNIVERSITIES ARE DEALING WITH

03:27:14.922 --> 03:27:15.890
THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:27:15.956 --> 03:27:18.292
ISSUES I'M NOT -- CERTAIN.

03:27:18.359 --> 03:27:20.494
ANOTHER -- POTENTIAL SOURCE OF

03:27:20.561 --> 03:27:22.530
REVENUE WE HAVE IS OUR DONORS

03:27:22.596 --> 03:27:24.532
ALUMNI EX SPECIALLY BUT SOME

03:27:24.598 --> 03:27:26.500
WEALTHIER DONORS -- BUT THEY

03:27:26.567 --> 03:27:28.102
USUALLY WANT TO TEAR DOWN A

03:27:28.169 --> 03:27:29.770
BUILDING A BUILDING NEW ONE WITH

03:27:29.837 --> 03:27:31.372
THEIR NAME ON IT SO.

03:27:31.438 --> 03:27:33.407
WE MADE WE GOT A SEXY DONATION

03:27:33.474 --> 03:27:34.909
GIVING TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

03:27:34.975 --> 03:27:36.343
IS HER WHO I DON'T THINK WE'VE

03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:39.914
GOTTEN ANYONE NEW SCIENCE

03:27:39.980 --> 03:27:43.651
BUILDING A NEW ROOF FOR THE WELL

03:27:43.717 --> 03:27:45.452
MAYBE IF THE OF THE YOU KNOW NOW

03:27:45.519 --> 03:27:46.387
I DON'T SAY THAT.

03:27:46.453 --> 03:27:47.788
OKAY THANK YOU QUESTIONS TWENTY

EVERY YEAR FOR THESE INITIATIVES

03:46:06.986 --> 03:46:07.754
BUT THIS IS KIND.

03:46:07.820 --> 03:46:09.889

04:02:00.672 --> 04:02:02.074
DID DISCOVER SYSTEM DEFECTS

04:02:02.140 --> 04:02:03.442
EARLY ON THOSE WERE ALL FIXED BY

04:02:03.508 --> 04:02:06.211
AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

04:02:06.278 --> 04:02:07.446
ALONG THE WAY WE BEGAN TO WORK

04:02:07.512 --> 04:02:09.281
MORE CLOSELY WITH THE GRADUATE

04:02:09.348 --> 04:02:09.548
STUDENT.

04:02:09.615 --> 04:02:12.251
POPULATIONS -- BECAUSE WE FOUND

04:02:12.317 --> 04:02:13.552
THE CAMPUSES WERE TREATING THEM

04:02:13.619 --> 04:02:17.322
AS REGULAR STAFF EMPLOYEES IN

04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.890
GRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE VERY

04:02:17.956 --> 04:02:18.757
UNIQUE.

04:02:18.824 --> 04:02:21.493
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEY'VE HAD

04:02:21.560 --> 04:02:24.329
TYPICALLY NON -- ADMINISTRATIVE

04:02:24.396 --> 04:02:26.331
PATHWAYS TO RESOLVE PAY PROBLEMS

04:02:26.398 --> 04:02:27.366
WHEN THEY ARISE SO A GRAD

04:02:27.432 --> 04:02:31.169
STUDENT FOR EXAMPLE THE CENTER

04:02:31.236 --> 04:02:31.703
OF THEIR UNIVERSE IS THERE

04:02:31.770 --> 04:02:32.571
DEPARTMENT.

04:02:32.638 --> 04:02:33.739
BUT A TYPICAL EMPLOY WOULD GO TO

04:02:33.805 --> 04:02:34.740
PAYROLL DEPARTMENT IF THEY HAD A

04:02:34.806 --> 04:02:36.608
PAY PROBLEM GRADUATE STUDENTS GO

04:02:36.675 --> 04:02:38.176
TO THEIR HOME DEPARTMENT SO

04:02:38.243 --> 04:02:40.178
WE'VE HAD TO FIGURE OUT WAYS.

04:02:40.245 --> 04:02:41.313
TO PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT

04:02:41.380 --> 04:02:42.414
SERVICES AND BETTER

04:02:42.481 --> 04:02:43.282
COMMUNICATION WITH THOSE

04:02:43.348 --> 04:02:45.584
DEPARTMENTS SO THAT IF AND WHEN

04:02:45.651 --> 04:02:47.219
A STUDENT HAS A PAY PROBLEM.

04:02:47.286 --> 04:02:48.487
WE CAN GET IT RESOLVED MORE

04:02:48.553 --> 04:02:50.889
QUICKLY -- AND THEY'RE PUT UNDER

04:02:50.956 --> 04:02:52.891
LESS FINANCIAL STRESS -- WE HAD

04:02:52.958 --> 04:02:54.026
ANOTHER DEPLOYMENT TO LOS

04:02:54.092 --> 04:02:55.360
ANGELES AND SANTA BARBARA LAST

04:02:55.427 --> 04:02:57.462
SEPTEMBER -- WE DIDN'T HAVE

04:02:57.529 --> 04:02:59.164
SYSTEM PROBLEMS AT THAT POINT

04:02:59.231 --> 04:03:00.899
BUT THE SCALE OF THAT DEPLOYMENT.

04:03:00.966 --> 04:03:02.534
OF RESOLVE SOME PROCEDURAL

04:03:02.601 --> 04:03:06.004
ISSUES THAT WE SINCE -- RESULT I

04:03:06.071 --> 04:03:07.239
WOULD OBSERVE THAT WE'VE ALSO

04:03:07.306 --> 04:03:08.907
NOW DONE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO

04:03:08.974 --> 04:03:10.876
REALLY HELP ANYONE WHO IS A PAY

04:03:10.943 --> 04:03:12.110
PRBLEM YOU SEE.

04:03:12.177 --> 04:03:13.979
FIRST THING WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

04:03:14.046 --> 04:03:15.213
BEGUN.

04:03:15.280 --> 04:03:16.949
ISSUING WHAT WE CALL PAY CARDS

04:03:17.015 --> 04:03:18.917
THESE ARE PRE LOADED DEBIT CARDS

04:03:18.984 --> 04:03:20.252
THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

04:03:20.319 --> 04:03:21.987
TO EMPLOY IF WE FIND OUT THERE'S

04:03:22.054 --> 04:03:23.755
A PAY PROBLEM WE CAN GET THEM

04:03:23.822 --> 04:03:25.457
PAID THE NEXT DAY WITH A PAY

04:03:25.524 --> 04:03:26.091
CARD THAT THEY CAN PICK UP ON

04:03:26.158 --> 04:03:27.359
CAMPUS.

04:03:27.426 --> 04:03:27.993
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR A

04:03:28.060 --> 04:03:32.331
CHECK -- WE HAVE ALSO -- BEGUN --

04:03:32.397 --> 04:03:33.865
OTHER PROCEDURES WORKING WITH

04:03:33.932 --> 04:03:35.934
CAMPUSES IF IN EMERGENCY

04:03:36.001 --> 04:03:37.235
SITUATIONS AN EMPLOYEE NEEDS.

04:03:37.302 --> 04:03:38.570
AN AMOUNT OF THEIR PAY BUT NOT

04:03:38.637 --> 04:03:40.072
THE FULL PAY TO GET TO THE NEXT

04:03:40.138 --> 04:03:41.807
PAY PERIOD WE'VE WORKED OUT

04:03:41.873 --> 04:03:43.108
THOSE PROCEDURES AS WELL.

04:03:43.175 --> 04:03:44.643
AND THEN FINALLY I WOULD OBSERVE

04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:48.180
THAT -- WE ARE WE HAVE NOW A

04:03:48.246 --> 04:03:49.681
SMALL UNIT WITHIN THE PAST

04:03:49.748 --> 04:03:50.382
CENTER.

04:03:50.449 --> 04:03:51.883
THAT IS COMPLETELY DEDICATED TO

04:03:51.950 --> 04:03:53.218
RESOLVING ANY KIND OF STUDENT

04:03:53.285 --> 04:03:54.853
PAY ISSUE ONCE WERE AWARE OF IT

04:03:54.920 --> 04:03:56.755
WE HAVE A TIGER TEAM -- THEY CAN

04:03:56.822 --> 04:03:58.156
RESOLVE IT AS QUICKLY AS

04:03:58.223 --> 04:04:00.492
POSSIBLE FOR THAT STUDENT -- THE

04:04:00.559 --> 04:04:02.561
OTHER OF THE PROGRESS THAT I

04:04:02.627 --> 04:04:04.997
WOULD OBSERVE IN OUR PAY IN OUR

04:04:05.063 --> 04:04:06.431
DEPLOYMENTS.

04:04:06.498 --> 04:04:08.934
WE DEPLOYED BERKELEY IN MARCH OF

04:04:09.001 --> 04:04:10.535
THIS YEAR SO WE ADDED ANOTHER

04:04:10.602 --> 04:04:12.671
ROUGHLY TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND

04:04:12.738 --> 04:04:13.905
EMPLOYEES TO YOU SEE PATH --

04:04:13.972 --> 04:04:16.308
THAT HAS BEEN OUR MOST EFFECTIVE

04:04:16.375 --> 04:04:18.543
DEPLOYMENT TO DATE -- WHEREAS

04:04:18.610 --> 04:04:20.145
WITH THE OTHER CAMPUSES WE HAD A

04:04:20.212 --> 04:04:22.280
BIG SPIKE IN CALLS TO THE UC

04:04:22.347 --> 04:04:24.149
PASSED CENTER -- WITH SPECIFIC

04:04:24.216 --> 04:04:27.052
ISSUES OUR INITIAL TWO MONTHS

04:04:27.119 --> 04:04:28.887
WORKING WITH BERKELEY -- WHO ARE

04:04:28.954 --> 04:04:31.590
NOW ROUGHLY 2425% OF THE PERIL

04:04:31.656 --> 04:04:32.657
POPULATION?

04:04:32.724 --> 04:04:34.726
THEY'RE GENERATING LESS THAN 19%

04:04:34.793 --> 04:04:38.030
OF THE CASES THAT COME INTO THE

04:04:38.096 --> 04:04:38.830
UC PATH CENTER.

04:04:38.897 --> 04:04:39.331
SO PROPORTIONATELY WE'RE

04:04:39.398 --> 04:04:40.899
ACTUALLY HAVING A MUCH BETTER

04:04:40.966 --> 04:04:42.801
SUCCESS WITH BERKELEY AND WE'VE

04:04:42.868 --> 04:04:44.469
HAD WITH PREVIOUS DEPLOYMENTS SO

04:04:44.536 --> 04:04:45.971
WE'RE APPLYING LESSONS LEARNED

04:04:46.038 --> 04:04:47.572
FROM EACH OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS --

04:04:47.639 --> 04:04:49.241
IN PARTICULAR THE STEPS WE'VE

04:04:49.307 --> 04:04:50.542
TAKEN TO WORK WITH STUDENT

04:04:50.609 --> 04:04:52.577
GROUPS DIRECTLY TO COMMUNICATE

04:04:52.644 --> 04:04:53.879
THE CHANGES TO HELP THEM

04:04:53.945 --> 04:04:55.647
UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET SUPPORT IF

04:04:55.714 --> 04:04:56.848
THEY HAVE ISSUES.

04:04:56.915 --> 04:04:58.850
AND TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENTS WHO

04:04:58.917 --> 04:05:01.820
ARE DOING TRANSACTION DATA ENTRY

04:05:01.887 --> 04:05:02.788
TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE

04:05:02.854 --> 04:05:04.122
APPROPRIATE TRAINING.

04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:06.224
ALL OF THOSE COMBINED -- HAVE

04:05:06.291 --> 04:05:09.461
WORKS TO IMPROVE -- OUR ABILITY

04:05:09.528 --> 04:05:09.928
TO DELIVER STUDENT PAY

04:05:09.995 --> 04:05:12.297
ACCURATELY AND ON TIME.

04:05:12.364 --> 04:05:14.433
AND I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT WITHIN

04:05:14.499 --> 04:05:16.601
THAT ACCURATELY ON TIME -- OUT

04:05:16.668 --> 04:05:20.572
OF THE GATE WERE ROUGHLY 98299% --

04:05:20.639 --> 04:05:22.374
AND SO WE'RE DEALING WITH A ONE

04:05:22.441 --> 04:05:23.241
TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE

04:05:23.308 --> 04:05:26.144
POPULATION WHERE WE FIND.

04:05:26.211 --> 04:05:26.912
SOME ISSUE THAT HAS TO BE

04:05:26.978 --> 04:05:29.915
RESOLVED ROUGHLY 42405% OF THOSE

04:05:29.981 --> 04:05:31.950
CASES ARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE

04:05:32.017 --> 04:05:34.686
CAMPUS HAS NOT SUBMITTED TIME

04:05:34.753 --> 04:05:35.821
CORRECTLY.

04:05:35.887 --> 04:05:37.389
THE THE TIME FILES FOR THEFOR

04:05:37.456 --> 04:05:38.990
THE EMPLOYEES ON TIME OR

04:05:39.057 --> 04:05:40.659
ACCURATELY WE HAVE TO GO BACK

04:05:40.725 --> 04:05:42.461
RESULT THE TIME FILES ONCE WE DO

04:05:42.527 --> 04:05:45.063
THAT -- THE PAY IS FINE.

04:05:45.130 --> 04:05:47.132
BOB AS A FINAL STEP I WANT TO

04:05:47.199 --> 04:05:48.934
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT -- THE STUDENT

04:05:49.000 --> 04:05:50.869
PAY ISSUES WE HAD -- HAD

04:05:50.936 --> 04:05:52.437
VISIBILITY WITH THE PRESIDENT

04:05:52.504 --> 04:05:53.939
SHE HAS CONVENED A STUDENT PAY

04:05:54.005 --> 04:05:55.340
WORKING GROUP.

04:05:55.407 --> 04:05:57.375
THAT HAS -- AN OBLIGATION TO

04:05:57.442 --> 04:05:59.177
DELIVER A REPORT TO HER BY JUNE

04:05:59.244 --> 04:06:00.846
THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR.

04:06:00.912 --> 04:06:01.947
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

04:06:02.013 --> 04:06:03.515
SPECIFICALLY AROUND IMPROVING

04:06:03.582 --> 04:06:05.517
PAY FOR STUDENTS IN THE SHORT

04:06:05.584 --> 04:06:07.953
TERM AND BY THAT SHE MEANS.

04:06:08.019 --> 04:06:09.754
ANY IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE IN

04:06:09.821 --> 04:06:11.890
TIME FOR THE DAVIS AN A AND R.

04:06:11.957 --> 04:06:13.625
DEPLOYMENT THIS FALL.

04:06:13.692 --> 04:06:15.460
AND THEN LONGER TERM ARE THERE

04:06:15.527 --> 04:06:18.096
POLICY ISSUES THAT THE

04:06:18.163 --> 04:06:19.397
UNIVERSITY USES.

04:06:19.464 --> 04:06:21.900
THAT MAKES STUDENT PAY MORE

04:06:21.967 --> 04:06:23.268
COMPLEX THAN IT NEEDS TO BE.

04:06:23.335 --> 04:06:25.103
AND OTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

04:06:25.170 --> 04:06:27.873
THAT WE CAN PURSUE A TO SIMPLIFY

04:06:27.939 --> 04:06:29.875
OR OR REDUCE THE COMPLEXITY OF

04:06:29.941 --> 04:06:31.209
STUDENT PAY.

04:06:31.276 --> 04:06:33.478
IN EXAMPLE I WOULD GIVE THERE IS

04:06:33.545 --> 04:06:35.347
AROUND PAY PERIODS AND AGAIN

04:06:35.413 --> 04:06:36.615
WITH THE GRADUATE STUDENTS WHO

04:06:36.681 --> 04:06:38.316
HAVE COMPETING MONTHLY.

04:06:38.383 --> 04:06:40.218
AND BI WEEKLY PAY PERIODS ONE OF

04:06:40.285 --> 04:06:41.353
THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE TO ASK

04:06:41.419 --> 04:06:42.621
OURSELVES.

04:06:42.687 --> 04:06:45.056
DOES IT CONTINUE TO MAKE SENSE

04:06:45.123 --> 04:06:47.859
TO HAVE STUDENT POSITIONS.

04:06:47.926 --> 04:06:48.460
THAT LIVE IN TWO DIFFERENT PAY

04:06:48.527 --> 04:06:50.162
CYCLES SHOULD WE CONSIDER

04:06:50.228 --> 04:06:51.830
SOMETHING LIKE ALL STUDENT PLAYS

04:06:51.897 --> 04:06:54.266
HAVE IN COMMON PAY CYCLE WHICH

04:06:54.332 --> 04:06:55.667
WOULD REDUCE THAT COMPLEXITY.

04:06:55.734 --> 04:06:56.902
SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT THIS

04:06:56.968 --> 04:06:58.370
STUDENT PAY WORKING GROUP IS

04:06:58.436 --> 04:07:00.305
LOOKING AT AND WILL DELIVER IN

04:07:00.372 --> 04:07:02.641
THEIR REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT IN

04:07:02.707 --> 04:07:03.108
JUNE.

04:07:03.175 --> 04:07:03.875
OKAY.

04:07:03.942 --> 04:07:06.111
UP IN THE NEXT SLIDE A ONE OF A

04:07:06.178 --> 04:07:07.746
JUST QUICKLY REVIEW OUR CURRENT

04:07:07.812 --> 04:07:11.883
YEAR -- FORECAST -- AND COMPARED

04:07:11.950 --> 04:07:13.285
TO OUR BUDGET.

04:07:13.351 --> 04:07:14.753
INITIALLY THE BUDGET THAT.

04:07:14.819 --> 04:07:17.222
WAS APPROVED FOR THIS YEAR WAS

04:07:17.289 --> 04:07:17.989
SIXTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION

04:07:18.056 --> 04:07:20.659
DOLLARS -- AND IN THE ALLOCATION

04:07:20.725 --> 04:07:22.627
THAT -- WHILE WE WERE PROVIDED

04:07:22.694 --> 04:07:23.995
THERE WAS A A BASE AMOUNT OF

04:07:24.062 --> 04:07:26.097
GENERAL FUNDS FROM THE

04:07:26.164 --> 04:07:27.032
LEGISLATURE.

04:07:27.098 --> 04:07:28.600
US AID A CHARGE BACK TO THE

04:07:28.667 --> 04:07:31.036
CAMPUSES -- THROUGH A CAMPUS

04:07:31.102 --> 04:07:32.871
ASSESSMENT FOR ANY REMAINING

04:07:32.938 --> 04:07:34.139
EXPENSE.

04:07:34.206 --> 04:07:35.774
OUR CURRENT FORECAST FOR THE

04:07:35.840 --> 04:07:37.909
YEAR IS UP TO SEVENTY SIX

04:07:37.976 --> 04:07:39.377
MILLION DOLLARS -- SO WE

04:07:39.444 --> 04:07:40.745
SUBMITTED A BUDGET CHANGE

04:07:40.812 --> 04:07:42.581
PROPOSAL TO DO F. R. D. O. F.

04:07:42.647 --> 04:07:45.550
APPROVED THAT A CHANGE.

04:07:45.617 --> 04:07:46.918
AND SO WE ARE NOW COMMUNICATING

04:07:46.985 --> 04:07:49.254
WITH THE CAMPUS IS -- WHO WILL

04:07:49.321 --> 04:07:50.989
BEAR THAT ADDITIONAL --

04:07:51.056 --> 04:07:52.624
COMPONENT IN THEIR ASSESSMENT

04:07:52.691 --> 04:07:53.658
THIS YEAR.

04:07:53.725 --> 04:07:54.993
THAT A POINT TWO MILLION REALLY --

04:07:55.060 --> 04:07:56.828
CENTERED AROUND THE DEBT SERVICE

04:07:56.895 --> 04:07:57.729
AMOUNT THAT YOU SEE AT THE

04:07:57.796 --> 04:07:59.864
BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE -- TABLE ON

04:07:59.931 --> 04:08:03.702
SLIDE -- FIVE WE HAD PROJECTED

04:08:03.768 --> 04:08:05.837
SOME SAVINGS FORM ARE HOSTING

04:08:05.904 --> 04:08:08.273
COSTS FOR THE TECHNICAL SOLUTION

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:08.907
FOR YOU SEE PATH.

04:08:08.974 --> 04:08:10.875
THAT DID NOT -- A MATERIALIZE

04:08:10.942 --> 04:08:12.077
THIS YEAR.

04:08:12.143 --> 04:08:13.912
AND THEN WITH THE LA IN SANTA

04:08:13.979 --> 04:08:15.513
BARBARA DEPLOYMENT WE HAD SOME

04:08:15.580 --> 04:08:17.582
ADDITIONAL STABILIZATION COSTS

04:08:17.649 --> 04:08:19.484
WHICH ARE REALLY LABOR COSTS --

04:08:19.551 --> 04:08:21.152
AND SO THAT'S WHAT DROVE -- THE

04:08:21.219 --> 04:08:23.221
CHANGE FROM THE BUDGET INTO THE

04:08:23.288 --> 04:08:26.024
FORECAST THIS YEAR -- OF AS WE

04:08:26.091 --> 04:08:27.792
LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT FISCAL

04:08:27.859 --> 04:08:30.395
YEAR -- WERE REALLY LOOKING AT

THIS IS NOT AN OPERATING EXPENSE

04:10:04.622 --> 04:10:07.292

RIVERSIDE ON THE PAST -- I THINK

04:11:03.815 --> 04:11:06.084
BACK IN DECEMBER JANUARY OF THIS

04:11:06.151 --> 04:11:10.155

I I WANT TO POINT OUT THE UC

04:11:16.027 --> 04:11:19.397
PATH IS LOCATED -- IN RIVERSIDE.

04:11:19.464 --> 04:11:22.267
A FEW MILES FROM THE UC OUR

04:11:22.333 --> 04:11:26.137
CAMPUS BUT NOT ON THE CAMPUS.

04:11:26.204 --> 04:11:28.139
AND SO IT IT IT OPERATES.

04:11:28.206 --> 04:11:30.208
INDEPENDENTLY REALLY OF THE

04:11:30.275 --> 04:11:32.444
CAMPUS OF UC ARE CORRECT.

04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:34.145
BUT I DID GET TO GO TO THE

04:11:34.212 --> 04:11:34.813
RIBBON CUTTING.

04:11:34.879 --> 04:11:39.784
CEREMONY -- FOR FOR FIVE YEARS

04:11:39.851 --> 04:11:44.289
AGO. SIX I THINK YEAH SIX YOUR

04:11:44.355 --> 04:11:47.325
HONOR -- YES SIX YEARS AGO.

04:11:47.392 --> 04:11:49.527
AND THERE'S AN IRONY ABOUT THIS

04:11:49.594 --> 04:11:51.463
THIS PROJECT.

04:11:51.529 --> 04:11:53.932
AND IT'S IT'S NOT A GOOD IRONY --

04:11:53.998 --> 04:11:55.967
IF YOU LOOK HERE AT AT OUR

04:11:56.034 --> 04:11:58.736
BACKGROUND MATERIAL ADDITION ON

04:11:58.803 --> 04:12:01.840
ISSUE.

04:12:01.906 --> 04:12:04.008
EIGHT THE UC PATH WAS ONE OF THE

04:12:04.075 --> 04:12:05.844
IDEAS THAT CAME OUT OF COST

04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:07.679
SAVINGS.

04:12:07.745 --> 04:12:09.314
SO THAT YOU SEE PATH AND THE

04:12:09.380 --> 04:12:11.749
IDEA OF CENTRALIZING.

04:12:11.816 --> 04:12:15.620
OF PAYROLL FOR YOU SEE WAS SEEN

04:12:15.687 --> 04:12:18.356
AND PROPOSED TO US AS A COST

04:12:18.423 --> 04:12:19.958
SAVER.

04:12:20.024 --> 04:12:21.626
A WAY OF CENTRALIZING AND SAVING

04:12:21.693 --> 04:12:23.895
MONEY.

04:12:23.962 --> 04:12:26.297
IN HERE ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN IT

04:12:26.364 --> 04:12:28.833
SAYS SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

04:12:28.900 --> 04:12:30.502
THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN COST

04:12:30.568 --> 04:12:33.972
SAVINGS -- AS IT WAS PRESENTED

04:12:34.038 --> 04:12:37.041
TO US. SIX YEARS AGO.

04:12:37.108 --> 04:12:41.212
OF CENTRALIZING PAYROLL

04:12:41.279 --> 04:12:41.513
[inaudible]

04:12:41.579 --> 04:12:45.149
OF BUT BUT IN AN ALSO HERE IT

04:12:45.216 --> 04:12:47.352
SAYS THE PROJECT IS MILLIONS OF

04:12:47.418 --> 04:12:49.587
DOLLARS COSTLIER THAN THE FIRST

04:12:49.654 --> 04:12:50.655
ESTIMATE.

04:12:50.722 --> 04:12:52.790
WHICH WAS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

04:12:52.857 --> 04:12:54.592
MILLION SO THE DIFFERENCE

04:12:54.659 --> 04:12:56.761
BETWEEN THE FIRST ESTIMATE.

04:12:56.828 --> 04:12:58.997
OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION.

04:12:59.063 --> 04:13:01.466
AND THE AND THE TOTAL CLASS.

04:13:01.533 --> 04:13:03.935
TODAY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

04:13:04.002 --> 04:13:05.103
THREE MILLION.

04:13:05.169 --> 04:13:07.005
SO THE DIFFERENCE.

04:13:07.071 --> 04:13:09.207
BASICALLY -- A CLOSE I DO THE

04:13:09.274 --> 04:13:10.942
MATH IN MY HEAD.

04:13:11.009 --> 04:13:13.211
ABOUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION

04:13:13.278 --> 04:13:14.245
DOLLARS MORE.

04:13:14.312 --> 04:13:17.515
ROUGHLY ROUGHLY.

04:13:17.582 --> 04:13:21.686
AND NO COST SAVINGS [inaudible]

04:13:21.753 --> 04:13:23.755
AT ALL.

04:13:23.821 --> 04:13:26.424
RIGHT NO NO NO COST SAVINGS AT

04:13:26.491 --> 04:13:31.829
ALL MOVING FORWARD -- IT IS THE

04:13:31.896 --> 04:13:33.698
THE THE IRONY TO ME IS YOU KNOW

04:13:33.765 --> 04:13:35.166
THAT THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS

04:13:35.233 --> 04:13:36.668
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A COST

04:13:36.734 --> 04:13:37.769
SAVER.

04:13:37.835 --> 04:13:44.409
IS SO MUCH MORE OVER BUDGET --

04:13:44.475 --> 04:13:45.910
WHEN IT IS OVER?

04:13:45.977 --> 04:13:49.047
WHEN IT'S OVER AND ALL THE THE

04:13:49.113 --> 04:13:50.348
CAMPUSES ARE BROUGHT?

04:13:50.415 --> 04:13:52.150
ONLINE.

04:13:52.216 --> 04:13:54.118
WILL IT SAVE ANY MONEY TO YOU

04:13:54.185 --> 04:13:57.388
SEE.

04:13:57.455 --> 04:13:59.557
SO THAT CAN I OFFER AN ANSWER

04:13:59.624 --> 04:14:01.092
THAT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF

04:14:01.159 --> 04:14:02.527
PARAGRAPHS TO WORK THROUGH.

04:14:02.594 --> 04:14:04.095
THE ANSWER IS OVER TIME THE

04:14:04.162 --> 04:14:06.798
POTENTIAL EXISTS SO WHAT WE

04:14:06.864 --> 04:14:08.266
STARTED WITH.

04:14:08.333 --> 04:14:10.301
IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT ARE

04:14:10.368 --> 04:14:11.502
ELEVEN DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF A

04:14:11.569 --> 04:14:13.771
PAYROLL SYSTEM THAT HAVE BEEN IN

04:14:13.838 --> 04:14:14.973
PRODUCTION FOR FORTY YEARS.

04:14:15.039 --> 04:14:17.175
SO ALL ELEVEN OF THOSE HAVE A

04:14:17.241 --> 04:14:19.711
COMMON CORE OF OF DOING PAYROLL

04:14:19.777 --> 04:14:21.312
BUT ALL ELEVEN HAVE BEEN HEAVILY

04:14:21.379 --> 04:14:22.880
CUSTOMIZED BY THE CAMPUS IS OVER

04:14:22.947 --> 04:14:24.616
TIME.

04:14:24.682 --> 04:14:26.084
AND THE UNIVERSITY INCREASINGLY.

04:14:26.150 --> 04:14:27.485
FINALLY HAD TROUBLE ACTUALLY

04:14:27.552 --> 04:14:29.320
DELIVERING PAYROLL SO THERE IS A

04:14:29.387 --> 04:14:31.055
RISK ASSOCIATED WITH STAYING

04:14:31.122 --> 04:14:34.292
WHERE WE WERE -- BUT WE ALSO HAD --

04:14:34.359 --> 04:14:37.261
INCREASING COMPLIANCE ISSUES IN

04:14:37.328 --> 04:14:40.231
MEETING IN PARTICULAR FEDERAL --

04:14:40.298 --> 04:14:43.267
REGULATORY OF COMPLIANCE -- YOU

04:14:43.334 --> 04:14:44.669
SEE.

04:14:44.736 --> 04:14:46.704
OBVIOUSLY DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY

04:14:46.771 --> 04:14:48.673
ON FEDERAL RESEARCH DOLLARS FOR

04:14:48.740 --> 04:14:50.208
PORTION OF ITS BUSINESS.

04:14:50.274 --> 04:14:52.377
THOSE RESEARCH DOLLARS COME WITH

04:14:52.443 --> 04:14:53.011
VERY HIGH COMPLIANCE

04:14:53.077 --> 04:14:54.846
REQUIREMENTS INCREASINGLY YOU

04:14:54.912 --> 04:14:56.047
SEE WAS NOT ABLE TO MEET THOSE

04:14:56.114 --> 04:14:57.649
COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS SO WE

04:14:57.715 --> 04:14:59.384
HAD TO DO SOMETHING.

04:14:59.450 --> 04:15:02.086
I CONCUR THAT THE PROJECT WAS

04:15:02.153 --> 04:15:03.655
OVERSOLD AT THE BEGINNING.

04:15:03.721 --> 04:15:05.723
THAT WAS A BUSINESS DECISION BY

04:15:05.790 --> 04:15:06.491
OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE

04:15:06.557 --> 04:15:10.094
UNIVERSITY -- PROBABLY HELPED

04:15:10.161 --> 04:15:11.496
OUT BY A VERY AMBITIOUS A

04:15:11.562 --> 04:15:13.765
CONSULTING FIRM THAT -- WAS

04:15:13.831 --> 04:15:15.733
QUICKLY REMOVED FROM THE PROJECT --

04:15:15.800 --> 04:15:18.069
BUT TO GET TO EFFICIENT TO GET

04:15:18.136 --> 04:15:19.470
TO EFFICIENCIES WHICH IS WHERE

04:15:19.537 --> 04:15:20.938
WE GET THE SAVINGS.

04:15:21.005 --> 04:15:22.273
WE HAD TO SPEND.

04:15:22.340 --> 04:15:24.142
A COUPLE OF YEARS WORKING WITH

04:15:24.208 --> 04:15:25.810
THE LOCATIONS THE CAMPUSES ON

04:15:25.877 --> 04:15:27.412
STANDARDIZING THE WAY WE DO

04:15:27.478 --> 04:15:28.246
BUSINESS.

04:15:28.312 --> 04:15:30.014
EVERY CAMPUS HAD A DIFFERENT WAY

04:15:30.081 --> 04:15:32.417
OF HIRING PEOPLE EVERY CAMPUS

04:15:32.483 --> 04:15:33.918
HAD A DIFFERENT WAY OF EXTENDING.

04:15:33.985 --> 04:15:37.121
BY ARRANGEMENT AGREEMENTS. FOR

04:15:37.188 --> 04:15:39.524
FOR NOTE TAKERS IN CLASSROOMS IN

04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:40.758
SO STANDARDIZING.

04:15:40.825 --> 04:15:42.727
THE CLASSIFICATIONS WE WERE

04:15:42.794 --> 04:15:44.495
USING STANDARDIZING HOW WE DO

04:15:44.562 --> 04:15:46.798
HIRES AND TERMINATIONS AND

04:15:46.864 --> 04:15:48.466
PROMOTIONS AND MERITS.

04:15:48.533 --> 04:15:50.401
SO THAT FROM ONE LOCATION TO THE

04:15:50.468 --> 04:15:52.670
NEXT IT WAS A REPEATABLE

04:15:52.737 --> 04:15:54.172
PREDICTABLE EXPERIENCE.

04:15:54.238 --> 04:15:55.440
WAS A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THIS

04:15:55.506 --> 04:15:58.376
PROJECT. TO GET TO EFFICIENCY

04:15:58.443 --> 04:15:59.177
YOU FIRST HAVE TO GET YOUR

04:15:59.243 --> 04:16:00.812
STANDARDIZATION AND I WOULD SAY

04:16:00.878 --> 04:16:02.346
THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGER

04:16:02.413 --> 04:16:03.448
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WHAT WE'VE

04:16:03.514 --> 04:16:05.416
DONE TO DATE.

04:16:05.483 --> 04:16:07.085
EVERY CAMPUS NOW DOES HIRING THE

04:16:07.151 --> 04:16:09.120
SAME WAY ONCE THERE AND YOU SEE

04:16:09.187 --> 04:16:09.454
PATH.

04:16:09.520 --> 04:16:11.589
THEY MANAGE -- EMPLOYEES IN

04:16:11.656 --> 04:16:13.791
POSITIONS AND VACANCIES THE SAME

04:16:13.858 --> 04:16:15.059
WAY AND YOU SEE PATH.

04:16:15.126 --> 04:16:16.594
AND SO WE NOW HAVE A

04:16:16.661 --> 04:16:17.695
STANDARDIZED WAY OF DOING

04:16:17.762 --> 04:16:20.765
BUSINESS ONCE EVERYONE IS ON I

04:16:20.832 --> 04:16:22.767
AM HIGHLY CONFIDENT WE WILL BE

04:16:22.834 --> 04:16:24.435
UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE FROM.

04:16:24.502 --> 04:16:25.803
THE CAMPUSES WHO IS SENT

04:16:25.870 --> 04:16:28.239
ESSENTIALLY OUR OUR ONGOING

04:16:28.306 --> 04:16:29.807
FUNDERS THROUGH A FEE FOR

04:16:29.874 --> 04:16:31.642
SERVICE MODEL. TO REDUCE THE

04:16:31.709 --> 04:16:33.311
COST OF PATH AND TO REDUCE THE

04:16:33.377 --> 04:16:35.747
COST OF PATH IT'S GONNA REQUIRE.

04:16:35.813 --> 04:16:37.148
THAT WE FIND EFFICIENCIES IN

04:16:37.215 --> 04:16:38.282
WITH THE WAY WE DELIVER THOSE

04:16:38.349 --> 04:16:40.184
SERVICES THE CAMPUS IS WILL NOT

04:16:40.251 --> 04:16:41.018
WANT TO GIVE UP QUALITY OF

04:16:41.085 --> 04:16:41.686
SERVICE.

04:16:41.753 --> 04:16:43.254
BUT THEY WILL WANT TO DRIVE DOWN

04:16:43.321 --> 04:16:44.889
THE COST OF THE SERVICE SO WE'RE

04:16:44.956 --> 04:16:45.523
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:47.925
DELIVER WHAT WE'RE DOING. FOR

04:16:47.992 --> 04:16:50.495
LESS OR TO ACCOMMODATE CONTINUED

04:16:50.561 --> 04:16:52.463
GROWTH IN THE UNIVERSITY WITHOUT

04:16:52.530 --> 04:16:53.931
GROWTH IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE

04:16:53.998 --> 04:16:55.633
OVERHEAD OF YOU SEE PATH.

04:16:55.700 --> 04:16:57.435
AND THAT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO

04:16:57.502 --> 04:16:59.403
DRIVE THE EFFICIENCY BENEFITS OF

04:16:59.470 --> 04:17:01.939
YOU SEE PATH ONCE WE HAVE

04:17:02.006 --> 04:17:04.242
EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM.

04:17:04.308 --> 04:17:05.743
IT IS THE ANSWER HELP.

04:17:05.810 --> 04:17:08.546
SOMEONE OKAY AND AND I I I KNOW

04:17:08.613 --> 04:17:10.782
YOU KNOW HOW LATE IN THE EVENING

04:17:10.848 --> 04:17:14.652
IT HAS BECOME -- BUT AGAIN.

04:17:14.719 --> 04:17:17.889
I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE OTHER --

04:17:17.955 --> 04:17:19.857
THINGS THAT YOU SEE BROUGHT

04:17:19.924 --> 04:17:21.559
FORWARD AND I WISH I DID -- THAT

04:17:21.626 --> 04:17:23.661
WERE COST SAVINGS -- BECAUSE

04:17:23.728 --> 04:17:25.396
THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THEM ONE AND

04:17:25.463 --> 04:17:26.831
I FORGET WHAT THE OTHER ONES ARE

04:17:26.898 --> 04:17:28.366
WORK.

04:17:28.432 --> 04:17:29.433
THAT THEIR WORK IS ALREADY

04:17:29.500 --> 04:17:30.835
WORKING SMARTER AND THERE WERE

04:17:30.902 --> 04:17:32.470
THERE WERE OTHERS THERE WERE

04:17:32.537 --> 04:17:34.071
OTHERS BUT THIS ONE CERTAINLY.

04:17:34.138 --> 04:17:36.073
DIDN'T DIDN'T MAKE IT I DON'T

04:17:36.140 --> 04:17:39.143
THINK -- AND THEN YOU SAID YOU

04:17:39.210 --> 04:17:44.115
KNOW 1% OF ALL THE ALL THE THE

04:17:44.182 --> 04:17:47.919
PAYCHECKS ONE STUDENT ONE ONE

04:17:47.985 --> 04:17:48.519
ONE TO ONE AND A HALF PERCENT

04:17:48.586 --> 04:17:51.756
AND BUT THAT.

04:17:51.823 --> 04:17:54.659
1% OR ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OF

04:17:54.725 --> 04:17:56.360
PAYCHECKS.

04:17:56.427 --> 04:17:58.296
REPRESENTS WHAT NUMBER OF

04:17:58.362 --> 04:17:59.363
PAYCHECKS.

04:17:59.430 --> 04:18:00.565
BECAUSE IT'S A BIG NUMBER IT IS

04:18:00.631 --> 04:18:01.899
A BIG NUMBER AND WHAT NUMBER IS

04:18:01.966 --> 04:18:05.336
THAT SO ON AN AVERAGE SO WITH A

04:18:05.403 --> 04:18:05.870
HUNDRED THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

04:18:05.937 --> 04:18:07.939
CURRENTLY -- THAT WOULD MEAN

04:18:08.005 --> 04:18:09.473
WE'RE DOING ONE MONTHLY PAY

04:18:09.540 --> 04:18:11.909
CYCLE AND TO BI WEEKLY PAY

04:18:11.976 --> 04:18:13.211
CYCLES ROUGHLY PER MONTH.

04:18:13.277 --> 04:18:15.713
SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ROUGHLY

04:18:15.780 --> 04:18:16.480
THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHECKS A

04:18:16.547 --> 04:18:17.281
MONTH.

04:18:17.348 --> 04:18:24.188
SO 11% OF 300-100-03000. THREE

04:18:24.255 --> 04:18:25.790
THOUSAND SO THAT'S HOW THAT 1%

04:18:25.857 --> 04:18:27.859
THAT'S THREE THOUSAND AND AND

04:18:27.925 --> 04:18:29.694
AND AND JUST FOR MY COLLEAGUES.

04:18:29.760 --> 04:18:32.029
THAT'S THREE THOUSAND GRADUATE

04:18:32.096 --> 04:18:34.165
STUDENTS.

04:18:34.232 --> 04:18:36.834
WHOSE PAYCHECKS WERE WRONG. FOR

04:18:36.901 --> 04:18:39.103
RICH A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IF I

04:18:39.170 --> 04:18:39.904
COULD OFFER JUST A SLIGHT

04:18:39.971 --> 04:18:43.407
CORRECTION -- IT'S PAYCHECKS THE

04:18:43.474 --> 04:18:43.841
REQUIRE SOME KIND OF

04:18:43.908 --> 04:18:45.109
INTERVENTION.

04:18:45.176 --> 04:18:48.279
RIGHT SO WE RUN.

04:18:48.346 --> 04:18:49.981
I'M I'M GONNA GET THE WEEDS AND

04:18:50.047 --> 04:18:50.615
MAYBE THAT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO

04:18:50.681 --> 04:18:51.716
BE.

04:18:51.782 --> 04:18:53.684
BUT THERE'S A THREE DAY PERIOD

04:18:53.751 --> 04:18:55.219
BETWEEN THE TIME WE ACTUALLY RUN

04:18:55.286 --> 04:18:57.555
A PAYROLL CALCULATION.

04:18:57.622 --> 04:18:58.456
AND THE TIME WE ACTUALLY DELIVER

04:18:58.522 --> 04:18:59.223
PAY.

04:18:59.290 --> 04:19:01.225
AND THAT THAT ONE TO ONE AND A

04:19:01.292 --> 04:19:02.560
HALF PERCENT.

04:19:02.627 --> 04:19:04.562
DURING THAT THREE DAY PERIOD WE

04:19:04.629 --> 04:19:06.297
RUN REPORTS FOR THE CAMPUSES

04:19:06.364 --> 04:19:08.532
SUCH AS ZERO PAY REPORT THAT

04:19:08.599 --> 04:19:09.600
SAYS.

04:19:09.667 --> 04:19:11.235
HERE'S ALL THE EMPLOYEES THAT IT

04:19:11.302 --> 04:19:13.271
SHOULD BE GETTING PAID THAT WERE

04:19:13.337 --> 04:19:15.539
SHOWING ZERO VALUE FOR DID YOU

04:19:15.606 --> 04:19:16.807
NOT SUBMIT TIME FOR THEM.

04:19:16.874 --> 04:19:18.576
YOU KNOW WAS THERE OF A FILE

04:19:18.643 --> 04:19:19.844
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO US THAT

04:19:19.911 --> 04:19:22.079
WOULD ALLOW US SO WE ACTUALLY

04:19:22.146 --> 04:19:23.381
HAVE A WAY OF RECAPTURING.

04:19:23.447 --> 04:19:24.916
A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF THAT

04:19:24.982 --> 04:19:27.585
NUMBER IN TIME TO DELIVER PAY

04:19:27.652 --> 04:19:29.320
ACCURATELY IN ON TIME BUT FROM

04:19:29.387 --> 04:19:30.588
THE INITIAL PAY CAL THAT'S

04:19:30.655 --> 04:19:32.056
THAT'S THE ERROR RATE THAT I'M

04:19:32.123 --> 04:19:34.058
TALKING ABOUT.

04:19:34.125 --> 04:19:35.927
THAT THEN HAS TO BE MANUALLY.

04:19:35.993 --> 04:19:37.094
FIXED AND FOR WE CAN ALL I I

04:19:37.161 --> 04:19:38.529
GUESS THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT

04:19:38.596 --> 04:19:40.064
THAT IT MAY BE A SMALL

04:19:40.131 --> 04:19:41.933
PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S REFLECTS BUT

04:19:41.999 --> 04:19:44.535
BUT THAT'S A LOT OF STUDENTS.

04:19:44.602 --> 04:19:46.804
WHO ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND

04:19:46.871 --> 04:19:48.306
IF YOU'RE WITH THE ONE STUDENT

04:19:48.372 --> 04:19:49.807
WHOSE PAYCHECK?

04:19:49.874 --> 04:19:52.543

THE ESTIMATES AND WHAT IT WAS

04:21:05.583 --> 04:21:07.451
SUPPOSED TO BE COST SAVING.

04:21:07.518 --> 04:21:09.320
IT CERTAINLY HASN'T -- DONE WHAT

04:21:09.387 --> 04:21:12.323
