OF THE PUBLIC HERE IN THIS ROOM AS WELL AS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS KNOW THE STRUGGLE OF SO MANY CALIFORNIANS ON OUR STREETS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'RE HERE BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS -- BETWEEN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THROUGH MANY MANY DIFFERENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. AND YET HOMELESSNESS NOT ONLY CONTINUES -- BUT IT IS INTENSIFYING. AND SO WE WANTED TO HOLD TODAY'S HEARING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE. ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW FROM THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO THE STATE LEVEL TO THE LOCAL LEVELS WHAT PROGRAMS WHAT POLICIES ARE WE WORKING ON THAT WORK.

ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS I'M HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU TO DISCUSS HOW CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE TRUE PROGRESS. ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE STATE. THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS IS A NONPARTISAN NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION COMMITTED TO PREVENTING AN ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN THE U. S.. AT THE ALLIANCE WE KNOW THAT A GREAT DEAL OF HARD WORK AND STRATEGIC THINKING HAVE BEEN GOING ON HERE IN MANY LOCALITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND WE WANT TO COMMEND AND THANK THESE COMMUNITIES MANY OF WHICH ARE HERE TODAY. FOR WORKING TO END THIS COMPLEX PROBLEM IN A GROWING WE DIFFICULT DIFFICULT HOUSING ENVIRONMENT. FEDERAL PROGRAMS PRIMARILY HIDE THE VA AND THE U. S. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AMONGST OTHERS. HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A HOUSING ISSUE THAT HAS PROVEN SOLUTIONS THAT CAN EN PEOPLE'S HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY. EVEN IN A VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKET AND TRIES TO FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS. THE STATE ALSO HAS A KEY ROLE TO PLAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE SOLUTIONS AND ENSURING THAT THESE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS HAVE HOMES. AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO STAY THERE THE STATE SENATE'S LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN CRITICAL AND IS APPRECIATED. WE KNOW THE LIVES IT WILL SAVE AND THE FAMILIES IT WILL MAKE HOLE WE KNOW THE TAX PAYERS DOLLARS THAT WILL BE FREED UP. AND WE KNOW THE HEALTH IT WILL BRING BACK TO CAL TODAY I'M GOING TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE NATIONAL TRENDS AND HOMELESSNESS WERE CALIFORNIA STANDS IN REGARD TO THE NATION. AND KEY SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS WITHIN WHICH I WILL DISCUSS TO CRUCIAL AREAS OF ACTIVITIES HOUSING AND A LOCAL SYSTEMIC HOMES CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. SO FIRST WHERE DO WE STAND ON HOMELESSNESS NATIONALLY. HOMELESSNESS IS A COMMON PHENOMENON IN THE NATION AS IT IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR MOST RECENT NUMBERS ARE FROM. TWENTY EIGHTEEN NATIONALLY FIVE AND 520-008-0030 PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS ON A GIVEN NIGHT A POINT IN TIME. HOW'S THAT BROKEN DOWN. A THIRD OR ABOUT 35% OF PEOPLE ARE ON SHELTER NATIONALLY AND MOST TWO THIRDS OR INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS ADULTS. 33% OF HOMES PEOPLE ARE IN FAMILIES AND 16% ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS NATIONALLY. THE MOST DRAMATIC DECREASES IN HOMELESSNESS HAVE BEEN AMONG VETERANS AND CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT VETERANS HAS DECREASED BY 38% AND CHRONICALLY HOMES INDIVIDUALS BY 26%. THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES AND ALMOST EVERY SUBPOPULATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SIZEABLE FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN THOSE PARTICULAR POPULATIONS OTHER REASON FOR THOSE MAJOR TO CLIENTS AS WELL AS INCREASINGLY SMART COORDINATED APPROACHES. FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THE ALLIANCE HAS RECENTLY TURNED MUCH OF ITS FOCUS TO CREATING A FRAMEWORK TO TARGET MORE RESOURCES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AMONGST OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ADULTS. AS THIS IS THE LARGEST PERCENT OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND HAS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF RESOURCES DEVOTED TO THEM. WE ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THIS RESPONDING RESOURCES AS WELL SINCE THERE IS A SIMILAR PICTURE HERE. WELL HOMELESSNESS IS STILL A CRISIS THE OVERALL HOMES POPULATION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DECREASING STEADILY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS NATIONALLY. HAS DECREASED THIRTEEN POINT 6% IN THE LAST DECADE. THOUGH THERE WAS A SLIGHT UPTICK ABOUT LESS THAN 1% IN THE LAST YEAR LOT OF THAT COMES FROM CALIFORNIA. SO WHY HAS HOMES HAS GENERALLY BEEN GOING DOWN NATIONALLY. FUNDAMENTALLY THE FIELD HAS GOTTEN SMARTER ABOUT HOW TO HELP PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FEDERAL PROGRAMS HAVE FOCUSED ON INVESTING IN PROVEN AND PERMANENT HOUSING ORIENTED SOLUTIONS. CORD NEEDED CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEMS USING DATA BETTER AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET PEOPLE BACK INTO HOUSING FASTER. AND AS WE'VE BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL WE'VE ATTRACTED MORE FEDERAL INVESTMENT UNLIKE MOST SOCIAL ISSUES. AS THE PROBLEM HOMES HAS HAS GOTTEN SMALLER THE FEDERAL MONEY FOR HOMES IS ACTUALLY GENERALLY GOTTEN BIGGER AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED IN THE STRATEGIES BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY WORKING TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS THE MAJOR DRIVER OF HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE NATION AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE SPEND FAR TOO MUCH OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT. ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AREAS WITH GROWING NUMBERS OF COST BURDEN HOUSEHOLDS CAN EXPECT INCREASES AND HOMELESSNESS. THESE PLACES ARE OFTEN CITIES. SO HOW DOES CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO OTHER STATES AND TO THE NATIONAL TRENDS. CALIFORNIA AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW HAS MORE PEOPLE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND THE NATION. AND OF VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE ON SHELTERED MAINLY LIVE OUTSIDE IN PLACE IS NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION. 20% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE AT A POINT IN TIME. AMONG THE SUBPOPULATIONS OF HOMELESS PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST ON CHILDREN HOMELESS PEOPLE OF ANY STATE NEARLY NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE 69% OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S HOMES POPULATION IS ON SHELTER THIRTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE LAST FIVE YEARS OVERALL HOMELESSNESS DECREASE NATIONALLY BY ABOUT 6% INCREASE IN CALIFORNIA BY ABOUT 9%. HOWEVER IN THAT SAME FIVE YEARS FAMILY HOMELESSNESS DECREASED NATIONALLY BY 21% AND IN CALIFORNIA FAMILY HOMES IS ACTUALLY ALSO DECREASED BY 19% -- AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER ABOUT HOW THAT SEEMS TO REALLY COINCIDE WITH THE INCREASED INVESTMENT AND RAPID RE HOUSING ESPECIALLY AT THE HSP PROGRAM. SO CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A BECOMES POPULATION IN MAKING A DENT HERE WILL MAKE A BIG DENT OVERALL IN THE NATION. NOW ON TO DISCUSSING THE SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS THAT WE KNOW ARE WORKING NATIONALLY AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS RESPOND. FROM CAREFUL RESEARCH THE EXPERIENCE OF LEADING COMMUNITIES AND GROWING AND A GROWING POOL OF NATIONAL DATA. THE KEY ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO ENDING HOMES AS HAVE BECOME CLEAR. THERE ARE TWO CRUCIAL AREAS OF ACTIVITIES AND BOTH ARE ESSENTIAL TO MAKING A LASTING IMPACT ON HOMELESSNESS AND CREATING GOOD SYSTEM FLOW. WHICH MEANS MOVING PEOPLE QUICKLY FROM HOMELESSNESS TO HOUSING. NUMBER ONE HAVING LOCAL COORDINATED DATA DRIVEN HOMELESS CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEMS THAT USE A SYSTEMIC RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS THAT IS ENTIRELY FOCUSED ON RE HOUSING PEOPLE. AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND DIVERTING PEOPLE FROM HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HOMELESS CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT IF YOU ARE ABOUT TO BECOME HOMELESS OR YOU BECOME HOMELESS YOU CAN BE IDENTIFIED. KEPT SAFE AND THEN QUICKLY MOVED BACK INTO HOUSING. AND SECOND HAVING HOUSING RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT MAKES HOUSING MORE FOR AFFORDABLE OVER ALL SEE PEOPLE HAVE HOUSING TO GO TO AND CAN MAINTAIN THAT HOUSING. WILL START THE SECOND AREA HOUSING. THREE BASIC THINGS WE NEED FOR HOUSING ARE. RENT SUBSIDIES TO THE PEOPLE WITH VERY LOW RENT. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUNDING SO THAT MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE AVAILABLE. AND REASONABLE POLICIES REGARDING LAND USE AND ZONING THAT ALLOW FOR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. FEDERALLY SECTION EIGHT PUBLIC HOUSING OTHER HAD HOUSING PROGRAMS FUN THESE ACTIVITIES HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT FUNDED ANYWHERE NEAR THE LEVELS THAT ARE NEEDED. ONLY ABOUT 25% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF PERMANENT RENT SUBSIDY. EVER RECEIVE A VOUCHER. THAT INVESTMENT HAS BEEN DECREASING OVER TIME AT THE FEDERAL LEVELS. NEXT I'LL SPEND THE REST OF MY TIME DISCUSSING THE SECOND AREA OF ACTIVITIES THE COORDINATED HOMELESS CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM. THIS AREA OF ACTIVITIES FEDERALLY FUNDED BY THE HARD CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO LEAVES GAPS THAT LOCALITIES HAVE TO FILL. WHY IS A SYSTEMIC APPROACH CRUCIAL THE APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS HAS FUNDAMENTALLY SHIFTED OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES? WHERE EFFORTS OF THE PREVIOUS TWENTY YEARS WERE MARKED BY INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS WORKING TO MANAGE THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS THE SYSTEMIC COORDINATED APPROACH SEEKS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM PERMANENTLY? AND TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH ARE USING HOUSING FIRST INTERVENTIONS AND HAVING A STRATEGIC SYSTEMIC RESPONSE THAT INVOLVES PARTNERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS CITY COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL. NOT MISSING THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMES IS HAVE LOTS OF PROBLEMS AND HAVE SERVICE NEEDS HOMES THIS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST HOUSING CRISIS. THIS THE FEDERALRESPONSE INVESTS IN THE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK TO HOUSE PEOPLE QUICKLY WERE DIVERT PEOPLE FROM IMMINENT HOMELESSNESS. WHY COMMUNITIES WITH THE BEST RESULTS HAVE AN INTENSE FOCUS ON HOUSING PEOPLE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WE SEE THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND WE SEE THAT AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL? THE HOUSING FIRST APPROACHED. HELPING A HOMELESS PERSON MOVING TO HOUSE OTHER HELP ONCE THE PERSON IS HOUSED. HAS PROVEN TO GET BETTER RESULTS AT LESS COST WE'VE SEEN TONS OF RESEARCH ON THIS OVER THE YEARS SO WHAT IS HOUSING FIRST MEAN OPERATIONALLY. WE RECOMMEND TO PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT MODELS THAT USE THIS APPROACH. PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND RAPID RE HOUSING I WILL TOTAL ABOUT THESE INTERVENTIONS AND HOW TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET THESE RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM -- AND I SEE THAT IN THE IN YOUR PAPER YOU ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT THAT SOME HAPPENING ANSWER QUESTIONS. FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT MARCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO HAVE BEEN HOMES FOR A LONG TIME IT'S A SMALLER PERCENT OF OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION HERE. PERMANENT HOUSING PARENTS WERE OF HOUSING IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION. WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE THAT IS A PERMANENT HOUSING SUBSIDY COUPLED WITH INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSED -- AND THEN CONNECTING WITH THEM WITH ANY TREATMENT SERVICES THEY MAY NEED TO STAY HOUSE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THAT'S MOST OTHER FOLKS. YOU STILL NEED OTHER HOUSING STRATEGIES AND THOSE HOUSING STRATEGY SHOULD BE A COMBINATION OF CRISIS AND EMERGENCY BEDS RAPID RE HOUSING AND OTHER SUBSIDIZED HOUSING. WITH RESPECT TO CRISIS BEDS OR SHELTERS OR NAVIGATION CENTERS WE DO NEED SHELTER WE NEED CHILDREN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE SHOULD NOT LIVE ON THE STREETS INTENSE OR IN CARS. SHELTER ALONE IS NOT THE SOLE SOLUTION. TO BUT SHELTER IS NEEDED AS A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO STAY BRIEFLY WHILE THAT SOLUTION HOUSING IS BEING ARRANGED TO BE EFFECTIVE SHELTER MUST BE LOW BARRIER AND HOUSING FOCUSED AND ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE. EXPERIENCING HOUSING CRISIS WITH LITTLE TO NO PRECONDITIONS IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT A RIGHT TO SHELTER DOES NOT EQUATE WITH THE RIGHT TO EXIT SHELTER TO HOUSING. HAVING THE HOUSING RESOURCES TO EXIT PEOPLE TO ARE CRUCIAL TO EFFECTIVE SHELTER DESIGN SO HOUSING SHELTER REALLY NEED TO GO TOGETHER. YOU CAN BILL MORE SOLDIER WITHOUT A HOUSING EXIT STRATEGY PEOPLE GET STUCK IN SHELTER FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO KEEP BUILDING MORE SOLDIERS BECAUSE I'LL JUST KEEP GETTING FALL. IF PEOPLE CAN GET OUT OF HOMES IS ON THEIR OWN AND DON'T NEED PERMITS PART OF HOUSING THEY SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO RAPIDLY HOUSING. RAPIDLY HOUSING IS ANOTHER HOUSING FOR A STRATEGY THAT ENDS A PERSON'S HOMES AS QUICKLY. BY USING IT IN LOOKS PENSIVE AND SHORTER ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES. THESE SORT OF SUBSIDIES RAPPER HOUSING WORK WELL EVEN IN VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS THE DATA SHOWS IS THAT AROUND THE COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PROGRAM SUCCEEDING QUICKLY HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE AND KEEPING THEM HOUSED AND THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY DO NOT RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS IN THE NEAR TERM. WE ALSO SEE THAT RAPIDLY HOUSING IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND WORKS BETTER THAN OTHER CRISIS INTERVENTIONS LIKE LONG SHELTER STAYS OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT RAPIDLY HOUSING IS ABSOLUTELY GETTING HARDER TO DO EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE OF HOUSING MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA. I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND THAT THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HARD WORK. HOWEVER THIS IS STILL THE BEST OPTION FOR MOST PEOPLE TO EXIT HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE TO HELP PEOPLE GET TO GET BACK INTO THE HOUSING MARKET THAT IS. NOT THE ONE WE WISH EXISTED BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TOOLS TO NAVIGATE THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING. PERHAPS INNOVATING BY OFFERING SURE HOUSING MODELS AN ON GOING CHAU SUBSIDIES. THE HOME SYSTEM CANNOT SOLVE EVERYTHING IT ALONE DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THESE LARGER ECONOMIC FORCES AT PLAY SO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT HOUSING MARKET AND THESE SOLUTIONS ARE IN FACT WORKING IN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA. THE DECREASE IN FAMILY HOMES AS APPEARS TO CORRELATE STRONGLY WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INVESTMENT AND RAPIDLY HOUSING FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE. FINALLY I'LL BRIEFLY MENTION PREVENTION THE FEDERAL PARTNERS ON HOMELESSNESS RECOMMEND A VERY TARGETED FORMA PREVENTION CALL DIVERSION WHICH HELPS TO DIVERT PEOPLE WHO WERE LITERALLY KNOCKING ON THE SHELTER DOOR THEY NEED SHELTER TONIGHT. WE ALSO RECOMMEND IMPROVING DISCHARGE PLANNING FROM INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEMS BY REQUIRING THEM THOSE SYSTEMS. DIFFICULT THERE AFTER EFFORTS ON HOUSING PEOPLE. BY TARGETING PROBLEM SOLVING HOUSING SUPPORT WE FROM THE HOMELESS SYSTEM LOCALITIES CAN REDUCE THE IN FLOW INTO HOMELESSNESS REALLY KIND OF TURNED DOWN THAT AUCET THAT IS -- CITING THE SYSTEM THAT'S WHY IS ALSO INFORMED TO ALSO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LIVING WAGE JOBS OF PEOPLE CAN MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT HOUSING. STATE SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES BY PUTTING IN STATE MONEY IN LOOKING AT FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT GO TO THE STATE THAT HAVE GENERAL PURPOSES AND CAN BE TARGETED. TOWARDS THE ACTIVITIES I'VE DISCUSSED AND FILL THE GAPS CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE NATION BY USING TEN F. AND CHILD WELFARE DOLLARS. TO STABILIZE PEOPLE AND HOUSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND FOR THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- ONE THING I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR ALL THE PANEL SAYS IT BUT IT'S POSSIBLE TO SEND YOUR TESTIMONY TO US EITHER AT THIS MOMENT OR OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT WE VERY HELPFUL I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED REQUESTS. FOR AS PART OF A THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING. I'M TO ANY FOOT THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. MY REMARKS THIS MORNING WILL ADDRESS THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL. THE ACTIONS AND DELIVERABLES WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON AND THE STATUS OF THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY A KEEP. TURNING FIRST TO THE ROLE AND SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN TO OVERSEE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FIRST GUIDELINES AND REGULATIONS. AND AMONG OTHER THINGS TO IDENTIFY AND COORDINATE STATE RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO PREVENT AND END HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS INITIALLY HOUSED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND GOT OFF TO A VERY GOOD START THERE FOR ITS FIRST YEAR. IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. THE COUNCIL WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY. AND THE SECRETARY OF B. C. S. H. THE AGENCY WAS DESIGNATED AS THE CHAIR OF THE COUNCIL. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ALSO PROVIDED RESOURCES TO HIRE FULL TIME STAFF FOR THE COUNCIL ONE OF WHICH IS MYSELF. AND THAT HAS ALLOWED THE ROLE IN SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL TO EXPAND -- BEYOND WHAT AS POSSIBLE WHEN IT WAS HOUSE H. T. T.. IT'S ALSO ELEVATED IT TO A LEVEL THAT IS A CROSS MORE OF THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN HELPFUL. THE COUNCIL IS COMPRISED OF UP TO NINETEEN MEMBERS REPRESENTING THE STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE HOMELESSNESS RELATED PROGRAMS AND HOUSING PROGRAMS. ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS. THE COUNCIL MEETS QUARTERLY. AND THE COUNCIL MEMBERS PROVIDE INPUT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CHAIR AND COUNCIL STAFF ON A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES AND PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNCIL. THERE IS AN INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP THAT MEETS EVERY OTHER WEEK THAT IS COMPRISED OF STAFF FROM THE STATE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL. AND THAT'S THE GROUP THAT DOES A LOT OF THE HANDS ON WORK TO SUPPORT THE COUNCIL IN IMPLEMENTING HOUSING FIRST. AND TOUGH TACKLING SOME OF THE OUT IT IS IN COORDINATING -- EFFORTS THAT ARE UNDER WAY. I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAS A COPY OF THE COUNCIL'S GOVERNANCE CHARTER WHICH WAS ADOPTED AT LAST WEEK'S COUNCIL MEETING. AND THAT HAS MORE OF THE DETAILS ABOUT THE GOALS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE COUNCIL. TURNING NEXT TO THE COUNCIL'S CURRENT WORK I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT WERE OF SOME VERY SMALL TEAM BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF ASPIRATIONS TO DO SOME OF THE HARDENED PORTENT WORK THAT'S BEING DONE -- AND ALSO OUR CURRENT WORK THAT WE'RE UNDERTAKING EITHER CURRENTLY OR HAVE PLANNED IN THE UP COMING YEAR. WE WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO MAKE% SURE THAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF THE GOVERNOR AND HIS TEAM. IN ADDITION TO IMPLEMENTING HEAP WHICH I WILL TALK ABOUT IN MORE DETAIL IN A FEW MOMENTS. ON THE COUNCIL IS IMPLEMENTING SEVERAL OTHER KEY INITIATIVES. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO IMPLEMENT HOUSING FIRST -- THERE HAS BEEN A CHECKLIST THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY EACH C. D. AND THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING. THAT PROVIDES GUIDANCE TO DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AS THEY LOOK AT THEIR HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED SERVICES PROGRAMS. TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING FIRST REQUIREMENTS. AND WHAT MODIFICATIONS TO REGULATIONS OR GUIDELINES MIGHT BE NEEDED TO MAKE SURE THAT HOUSING FIRST IS BEING IMPLEMENTED. ALL INITIAL ASSESSMENTS IN CHANGES TO STATE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE IDENTIFIED AND WE APPLY ON COURSE TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THOSE BY JULY FIRST JULY JULY FIRST -- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WERE SECONDLY WERE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A POTENTIAL STATE LEVEL HOMELESS DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM. THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE WITH THE DATA NECESSARY TO MAKE INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS. AND TO BETTER ALIGN RESOURCES IT'S OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. IMMEDIATE PRIORITY PHASE. ONE IS ESTABLISHING A STATE HOMELESS DATA SYSTEM THAT GIVES THE STATE ACCESS TO DATA THAT IS ALREADY BEING COLLECTED AT TE LOCAL LEVEL THROUGH HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THE SECOND PHASE WOULD BE TO BUILD A PLATFORM THAT CAN ALSO INTEGRATE AND ANALYZE DATA COLLECTED FROM STATE AGENCY AND DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS. GIVING US A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF WHO S HOMELESS IN CALIFORNIA WHAT SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE NECESSARY AND WHERE SOME OF THOSE THE GAPS IN THOSE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS OUR IF FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROJECT. WE ANTICIPATE PROCUREMENT FOR PHASE ONE WHICH IS GIVING THE STATE ACCESS TO DATA ALREADY BEING COLLECTED. THAT THAT PROCUREMENT COULD TAKE PLACE LATE SUMMER. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A WORK PLAN TO IMPLEMENT SB NINE EIGHTEEN THE HOMELESS YOUTH ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE WILL BE WORKING TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE MANY YOUTH HOMELESSNESS EXPERTS -- PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS. TO MAKE SURE THAT STATE AND LOCAL ENTITIES PROVIDING SERVICES TO YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. ARE IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES WHICH CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE FOR ADULT POPULATIONS. WE'RE ALSO EMBARKING ON AN INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A DATA DRIVEN EVIDENCE BASED HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC PLAN FOR THE STATE. THIS WORK WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING STATE STRATEGIES TO DEVELOP TO STOP THE GROWTH IN HOMELESSNESS TO SHELTER THE UN SHELTERED. AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE OVERALL HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. AS A FIRST STEP IN THIS WORK WE WILL BE ISSUING AN INVITATION TO THE RESEARCH POLICY AND PROGRAM EXPERTS IN THE STATE. TO PROVIDE US WITH BRIEF WHITE PAPERS ON SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THEIR EVIDENCE BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRIORITY ACTIONS THE STATE SHOULD TAKE. AND THERE ISN'T AN AMAZING ABUNDANCE OF EXPERTISE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN DRAW ON AND SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO REALLY SYNTHESIZE. A LOT OF THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE INTO A HIGH LEVEL PLAN THAT CAN REALLY MOVE US FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AT THE STATE LEVEL. WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO DEVELOP AND COLLABORATE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEER TO PEER LEARNING. ACROSS A NUMBER OF KEY TOPICS INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS. IMPLEMENTING BE COURTED ENTRY SYSTEMS AND OTHER TOPICS THAT REALLY FACILITATE EXACTLY WHAT CYNTHIA JUST SPOKE ABOUT AN EFFECTIVE. LOCAL RAPID EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING FOR WAYS THAT WE CAN ALIGN PROGRAM GOALS APPLICATIONS REQUIREMENTS REPORTING ACROSS STATE PROGRAMS AND WORKING WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS TO EASE SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. ON LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS THEY ARE APPLYING FOR AND MANAGING FUNDS FROM A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SOURCES. WE'RE ALSO WORKING THROUGH THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. TO SUPPORT THOSE OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO HAVE DIRECT OUR ROLES AND FIRE RECOVERY EFFORTS. AND PARTICULARLY IN RESPONDING TO THE HOMELESS AND HOUSING CHALLENGES THAT ARE EXACERBATED IN AREAS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE NATURAL DISASTER. IN ADDITION TO ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH THESE COMMUNITIES TO EXPEDITE THEIR RECEIPT OF HE FUNDS WE CONTINUE TO FACILITATE AND COORDINATE WITH OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL THROUGH THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP. TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES AND THEIR FIRE RECOVERY. WE'VE ALSO JUST ISSUED A BRIEF REPORT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF THE POINT IN TIME COUNTER THE PITCH COUNT WHICH IS COMING UP WELL IS ACTUALLY IN PROGRESS ACROSS THE STATE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- THIS WEEK AND NEXT WEEK. ON THE INFORMATION IS POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND INCLUDES CONTACT INFORMATION. FOR EACH OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AGING WITHIN THAT CAN TO MOVE CARE THE POINT TIME COUNT. WE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY WORKING WITH SACRAMENTO STEPS FORWARD TO PROVIDE -- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR STATE DEPARTMENT STAFF ACROSS THE COUNCIL TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS YEAR'S POINT IN TIME COUNT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. ALL OF OUR COUNCIL STAFF WILL BE PARTICIPATING. NEXT WEEK FOR TWO NIGHTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND I BELIEVE THE THE ACCOUNT THE COMMITTEE WAS PROVIDED OUR ACTION PLAN ARE PROPOSED ACTION PLAN FOR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND COUNSEL UPDATES IN THOSE PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ABOUT. OUR PROPOSED EFFORTS AND OUR CURRENT ACTIVITIES. TO TURNING LASTLY TO AN UPDATE ON KEEP. HE WAS ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. IT IS A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR FOR ONE TIME FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE DIRECT EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO CITIES COUNTIES AND CONTINUES OF CARE. TO ADDRESS THEIR HOMELESSNESS NEEDS. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS ARE THE ELEVEN LARGEST CITIES IN THE STATE THOSE WITH A POPULATION OF THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND OR MORE AS OF JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED USING A FORMULA THAT IS LARGELY BASED ON THE PROPORTION IN EACH C. O. C. ARC OR CITY LARGE WELL C. O. C. PRIMARILY -- OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION. THE PROGRAM GUIDANCE WHICH MAPPED OUT APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS IN ALLOWABLE ACTIVITIES WAS ISSUED IN AUGUST. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND THE NOTICE FOR OF AVAILABLE FUNDING -- WAS ISSUED ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH AND WE RECEIVED OUR FIRST TWO APPLICATIONS FROM OAKLAND AND SAN DIEGO ON SEPTEMBER. SIX AND I THINK THAT'S A RESULT OF THE EFFORTS MAKING THE APPLICATION PROCESS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. ON VERY STREAMLINED WITHIN AN EMPHASIS ON GETTING FUNDS OUT THE DOOR AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN KNOWING THE CRISIS IN MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE NOW RECEIVED APPLICATIONS FROM ALL FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF CARE AND ELEVEN LARGE CITIES. AND WE RECEIVED THOSE BY DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHICH WAS THE DEADLINE FOR APPLICATIONS FOR ROUND ONE OF FUNDING. pOF US FIRSTLY BECAUSE IT IT MEANS THE FUNDING WILL GO OUT MORE QUICKLY. AND ALSO BECAUSE IT MEANS WE DON'T HAVE TO DO A SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING AND THE KEEP TEAM CAN INSTEAD TURNED ITS EFFORTS TO PROVIDING SUPPORT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE BEING USED EFFECTIVELY I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHART THAT SUMMARIZES THE STATUS OF HEAT FUNDING FOR EACH OF THE A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON A FEW HIGH POINTS. AS OF JANUARY SIXTEENTH. ALL OF THE ELEVEN LARGE CITIES AND THIRTY FIVE CONTINUES OF CARE HAVE BEEN AWARDED THEIR FUNDS THAT MEANS WE GOT THEIR APPLICATION WE TURNED IT AROUND WE WE DEVELOP THE CONTRACT. WE SENT IT BACK OUT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN AND ISSUED THE AWARD. THESE AWARDS TOTAL OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR MILLION AND REPRESENT ALMOST 93% OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN AVAILABLE FUNDING. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MATT OUR INTERNAL GOAL. OF AWARDING HE FUNDS WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS OF RECEIPT OF A COMPLETED APPLICATION. ALSO AS OF JANUARY SIXTEENTH WE HAVE DISPERSED THE FUNDS TO EIGHT LARGE CITIES AND TWELVE OF THE CEO SEES. THESE DISBURSEMENTS TOTAL ALMOST TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR MILLION AND REPRESENT OVER 50% OF THE TOTAL FUNDING AVAILABLE. FOR A 100% OF THESE GRANTS WE HAVE MET OUR COMITMENT TO ACTUALLY DISPERSE THE FUNDS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE DATE THE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE. IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT FIRES IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE FURTHER EXPEDITED THIS PROCESS. AND WAVED A COUPLE OF THE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS TO ALLOW THOSE COMMUNITIES TO GET ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS AND BEGIN USING THEM. IMMEDIATELY TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. SO FAR THE CEO SEES AND CITIES CONTINUES OF CARE APOLOGIZE FOR USING THE SHORTHAND. I HAVE COMMITTED TO ALLOCATING THE FUNDS RECEIVED IN THE FOLLOWING GENERAL CATEGORIES SERVICES ARE PROPOSED TO RECEIVER TO BE A TOO YOU THE FUNDING TO BE USED AS 38% OF TOTAL FUNDS AWARDED. HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION THAT'S THE TOP CATEGORY OF PROPOSED USES FOR COMMITTED USES. SECOND IS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ALMOST IN OR ABOUT 34% OF TOTAL FUNDS AWARDED ARE GOING IN THAT CATEGORY. NEXT IS RENTAL ASSISTANCE SIXTY MILLION ABOUT 14% OF TOTAL FUNDS AWARDED. FOLLOWED BY YOUTH HOMELESSNESS AND THIS CATEGORY HAS BEEN ALLOCATED ALMOST 7% OF FUNDS THERE WAS A 5% SET ASIDE REQUIREMENT. AND WE'RE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE CHOSEN TO ALLOCATE MORE THAN THE REQUIRED 5% ON TO YOUTH HOMELESSNESS FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS COMMENTED ABOUT 4% OF TOTAL FUNDS AWARDED AND THAT'S BELOW THE THRESHOLD OF 5% SO AGAIN WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE SOME -- ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BEING ABSORBED BY THE CONTINUES OF KAREN CITIES SO THAT MORE FUNDS CAN GO TO DIRECT SERVICES. AND FINALLY ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION OR ABOUT 3% OF THE FUNDS ARE IN THE OTHER CATEGORY. WHICH IS THINGS LIKE RESTAURANT RESTROOMS AND HAND WASHING STATIONS AND ANY OTHER KIND OF SUPPORT AND SERVICE. IT'S NEEDED IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU ALL. LECTURE PRESENTATION LET'S MOVE NOW TO MISTER AUSTIN. THANKS I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESOURCES WE HAVE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT -- ESPECIALLY THE ONES FOCUSING ON HOMELESSNESS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DEPLOYING THE FIRST ALL START WITH IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM. AS YOU KNOW IN NOVEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO WHICH AUTHORIZED THE USE OF MENTAL SERVICES ACT FUNDING TO FUND THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM. NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROVIDES LOANS TO COUNTIES TO ACQUIRE BUILD OR REHABILITATE PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WITH A FOCUS ON PERSONS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND EXPERIENCING SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. IN ORDER TO BE READY FOR PROPERTIES PASSAGE EACH CD RELEASED NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF A HUNDRED AND NINETY MILLION. IN NON COMPETITIVE FUNDS FOR COUNTY APPLICATION DEADLINE IS AUGUST FIFTEENTH. TWENTY NINETEEN THOSE FUNDS CAN THEN BE USED TO LEVERAGE ANY COMPETITIVE FUNDS IN OUR FUTURE COMPETITIVE ROUNDS IF THEY'RE SUBMITTED BY FEBRUARY FIFTEENTH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN FOLLOWING THAT NON COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY WE RELEASED OUR FIRST COMPETITIVE NOTE NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. I MIGHT SAY NO FOR FROM HERE ON OUT IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME -- IN THAT FOR FOUR HUNDRED MILLION IN COMPETITIVE FUNDS. TO COUNTIES MUST SUBMIT THAT APPLICATION FOR COMPETITIVE FUNDS BY JANUARY THIRTIETH. AND WE ANTICIPATE AWARDING THOSE FUNDS IN JUNE OF TWENTY NINETEEN NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM ALSO ALLOWS FOR COUNTIES WITH OR 5% OF THE STATE'S HOMELESS POPULATION TO ELECT TO MINISTER THEIR OWN ALLOCATION FUNDS. TO THOSE COUNTIES ARE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SANTA CLARA AND SAN FRANCISCO. WINTERS BEAT THOSE COUNTIES WILL BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THEIR FUNDS NEXT MONTH IN FEBRUARY. WELL THEN RELEASE A SECOND NO FOR A FORK OF COMPETITIVE FUNDS IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACTIONS ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE DIRECTION HOW WE AT THE DEPARTMENT SHOULD EXPAND THE SHARE FIRST YEAR REVENUES FROM SENATE BILL TO PASS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHICH DESIGNATED HALF OF THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED FOR HOMELESSNESS PURPOSES. ARE THE FINAL RESULT WAS AN ALLOCATION OF 20% 5% OF THE OVERALL SB TWO FUNDS -- GOING TO CONTINUES OF CARE TO THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS AND HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH I'LL CALL CASH FROM HERE ON OUT. IN ANOTHER 25% GOING TO THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM. SO THE CASH PROGRAM OZ NEXT GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDES FUNDING TO CONTINUES OF CARE FOR HOUSING RELOCATION AND CIVILIZATION SERVICES OPERATING SUBSIDIES FOR PERMANENT HOUSING. FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDIES SHELTER OPERATIONS AND CAPACITY BUILDING. IN AUGUST TWENTY EIGHTEEN RELEASE THAT FIRST CASH NOVA. AND WE WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THOSE REMAINING CALIFORNIA WE'RE TO SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM DOLLARS THAT WE HAD WITH THE SB FIRST HALF OF THE SB TWO DOLLARS. FOR A TOTAL I KNOW FOR A FIFTY THREE MILLION. ALL THIS UC'S APPLIED FOR AND MORE WATER IN THE FIRST ROUND OF CASH FUNDS. WITH THOSE AWARDS BEING ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY ELEVENTH. OF THIS YEAR THIS COUPLE WEEKS AGO. WHICH IS THE REASON THE SECOND AND FINAL KNOW FOR FOR THAT PROGRAM IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY NINETEEN ONCE ALL THOSE TWENTY EIGHTEEN REVENUES FROM SB TO HAVE BEEN REMITTED. TO THE STATE. AND THAT NOTICE OF FUND AVAILABILITY WILL MAKE AVAILABLE THE REMAINING FUNDS WHICH WE THINK WILL BE A LITTLE BIT OVER THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THE HOUSING FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM RECEIVED THAT REMAINDER OF THAT FIRST YEAR ALLOCATION. AND CREATED TWENTY SEVENTEEN THREE BE SEVENTY FOR THE CLOSER -- TO HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS DESIGNATED TO REDUCE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL BURDEN AND LOCAL STATE RESOURCES DUE TO THEIR OVER REALIZATION OF MERCY DEPARTMENTS. IN PATIENT CARE NURSING HOME STAYS AT AND OTHER RESOURCES AS THE POINT OF HEALTH CARE PROVISION FOR PEOPLE WHO. ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS OR HOMELESS AND RELEASED THE DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR THIS PROGRAM IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ONCE ALL THOSE REVENUES ARE REMITTED ANTICIPATE RELEASING THE NOTICE OF FUND AVAILABILITY THIS MARCH. WE ALSO CURRENTLY IN OCTOBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN I SHOULD SAY RELEASED A NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY FOR OUR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING SAYS THE PROGRAM THAT WE FIND IT MANY TIMES OVER THE PAST AND RELEASED A SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF FUND AVAILABILITY. IN OCTOBER OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR AND THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES FINANCING FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS THE APPLICATION DEADLINE FOR THIS PROGRAM IS FEBRUARY EIGHTH. TWENTY NINETEEN AND WE ANTICIPATE ANNOUNCING HIS AWARDS THE SPRING. AND THAT THOSE THOSE FUNDS WERE CAN'T CAME FROM THIS INCOME RINSES FOR MORRELL R. PREVIOUS HOUSING BONDS PROPOSITION FORTY SIX PROBLEMS. SO THAT'S A LOT OF FUNDING -- ONE OF THE MOST RECENT AND NEW THINGS I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT IS -- WE JUST ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK THE ABILITY PROVIDE OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUT TO CONDITIONS OF KERR'S AND COUNTIES TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH NOT ONLY ARE FUNDING. BUT THE FUNDING THE FOR ABOUT PREVIOUSLY -- SO LAST THURSDAY WE ANNOUNCE THIS AVAILABILITY THAT WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUT TO CONTINUES OF CARING COUNTIES. TO ENHANCE DEVELOP OR BUILD LOCAL CAPACITY -- TO MANAGE MANAGE HOMELESSNESS AND REDUCE ALMOST AS SO THAT WHAT WE'VE THE POINT IS AN ON DEMAND RESPONSE MODEL. A CONSULTANT WILL BE DEPLOYED TO VERY SKINNY STATEWIDE FOR PRETTY BROAD ASSISTANCE IN THE AREAS A BUILDING LOCAL CAPACITY FOCUSING ON HOUSING STABILITY OR DRESSING HOUSING FIRST POLICIES. AND WE'VE HAVE THREE OPERA PROVIDERS UNDER CONTRACT THE TACKLE SYSTEMS COLLABORATIVE. THEY'LL HELP JURISDICTIONS BILL CAPACITY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY ASSIST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING HAS A CONTRACT ON HOUSING STABILITY. AND THE CENTER FOR COMIC CONCERNS FOR HOME BASE WILL HELP JURISDICTION ADVANCE HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. WE EXPECT -- THESE RESOURCES WILL ALLOW US TO THE POINT PROVIDE OVER. THIRTEEN THOUSAND HOURS OF ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES. AND IF YOU COME IN MANY FORMS DEPENDING UPON THEIR NEED WILL TRY TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE. WE EXPECT TO OFFER BOTH IN DEPTH REMOTE OR ONSITE ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS HOW TO GUIDES THROUGH ONLINE RESOURCES TOOL KITS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS -- WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER THIS TACKLE SYSTEMS BY COMBINING THE SMALL AMOUNTS OF TACKLE SYSTEMS RESOURCES FROM THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM IN THE CALIFORNIA MUSIC WERE TO SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM THAT REMAINS WE COMBINE THOSE IN ORDER. TO DEPLOY A LITTLE BIT. MORE CONFERENCE ASSISTANCE. IS THAT THE ON DEMAND MODEL THAT WERE OFFERING ALASKA STRETCH THOSE RESOURCES MORE BROADLY -- US PROBABLY AS POSSIBLE AS WELL -- COUNTIES AN SEE UC'S ARE ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS WE HAVE A UNTIL THE REQUEST ASSISTANCE VERY SIMPLY AUTHOR ARE A WEB PORTAL ON OUR WEBSITE. ABA COMPLETING REQUEST FORMS UNDER WHATEVER TYPE OF ACTIVITY THEY WANT TO ASK FOR WILL THEN ENGAGE WITH THEM AND AND BE ABLE TO DEPLOY ASSISTANCE THERE WHAT. IN IN A THEM ALSO I THINK IMPORTANT MENTION OF TALK A LOT ABOUT KIND OF THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES WE HAVE GOING ON BUT IN ADDITION ALL THAT. WE'RE STILL OPENING FIGHTING GUIDANCE TO LOOK GOVERNMENT'S BASED ON THE NUMEROUS LAWS WE PASSED OVER LAST YEAR. LAST COUPLE YEARS ONE IN PARTICULAR AB -- TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO STREAMLINED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE SUPPORT HOUSING IT'S AN ONSITE SUPPORT SERVICES. OUGHT TO DATE OBVIOUS THE LARGEST OFFICIALLY IT'S BEEN DIRECTLY WITH LOCALITIES HELPING ANSWER QUESTIONS. BUT WE DO HOPE TO HAVE -- FOR THE WRITTEN GUIDANCE ON HOW TO OFFER THE HOW TO HOW THAT HOW THAT AFFECTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR AND THEIR JOB MOVING FORWARD VERY SOON. WITHOUT A STOP THEIR HAPPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS THANKS THANKS VERY MUCH AND OUR FINAL SPEAK ON THIS PANEL MISS SUDDEN. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE GREAT WORK THAT CDSS IS DOING AROUND HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS TODAY AND WE ARE VERY EXCITED THAT THIS JOINT HEARING IS HAPPENING TODAY. BEFORE I DIVE INTO OUR SPECIFIC PROGRAMS I WANT TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON CSS AND WHY WE BELIEVE IT'S CRUCIALLY IMPORTANT TO BE. A PART OF OUR STATES EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS -- AS YOU KNOW CSS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND ADMINISTRATION OF PROGRAMS SERVING CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. OUR MISSION IS TO SERVE AID AND PROTECT NEEDY AND VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN WAYS THAT STRENGTHEN AND PRESERVE FAMILIES ENCOURAGE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND FOSTER INDEPENDENCE. SO WHY CA SS INVOLVED IN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS POLICY WE BELIEVE THAT HUMAN SERVICES AND HOUSING PROVIDER SHARE. SOME OF THE SAME GOALS AND THAT WE BELIEVE THAT WE THAT WE MOUNT MUST WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH EACH OTHER. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT CDSS SAFETY NET PROGRAMS CURRENTLY HELP MANY FOLKS AVOID HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO ACHIEVE HOUSING STABILITY IN OUR STATE. AND WHILE SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES CAN AND YOU MAKE HOUSING REFERRALS TO THEIR LOCAL HOMELESS SERVICES SYSTEMS WE'VE LEARNED THAT ONCE THESE REFERRALS ARE MADE FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS ARE OFTEN LEFT TO NAVIGATE TO NAVIGATE TO DESPERATE AND POTENTIALLY CONFUSING SYSTEMS -- OUR CSS FUNDED PROGRAMS WE ARE TRYING TO DIRECTLY REDUCE HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR CLIENTS WILL ALSO INCENTIVIZING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND HOMELESS SERVICES SYSTEMS LOCALLY. WE TRULY SEE OUR CSS HOUSING PROGRAMS AS A PIECE OF THE BROADER STRATEGY TO END HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA. SO HOW DO WE ACCOMPLISH THIS. THE HOUSING AND ALMOST AS BUREAU AT CDSS OVERSEAS FIVE FUNDED PROGRAMS -- WITH A COMBINED FINDING TOTALING AROUND TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THESE PROGRAMS ASSIST CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR HOUSING INSTABILITY WHO ARE BEING SERVED BY VARIOUS PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. THE CHART IN OUR BUREAU FACT SHEET WHICH I BELIEVE YOU ALL HAVE SUMMARIZES THESE PROGRAMS ALLOCATIONS AND THE COUNTIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THEM. SOMETHING OUR TEAM REALLY PRIDE OURSELVES IN HIS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT WE PROVIDE TO PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WE HOST WEBINARS WE DO MONTHLY CONFERENCE CALLS FOR ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS. AND WE HOUSE MULTIPLE LEARNING FORMS TO BRING OUR CAR COUNTIES TOGETHER TO PAY YOUR SHARE. THE THAT OPPORTUNITIES ALLOW FOR A LIVE TIME LEARNING AND TARGETED SUPPORT FROM CSS AS WELL AS TRAINING FROM NATIONAL STATE AND LOCAL EXPERTS AND HOMELESSNESS FIELD. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T MENTION IT'S INDIA HAS COME TO SOME OF THESE HURTING FORUMS TO PROVIDE HER EXPERTISE -- AND WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN IMPLEMENTING OUR PROGRAMS WITH AN EYE TOWARDS CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THE WORK WE ARE DOING MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE PILOTS -- IS QUITE INNOVATIVE BOTH FOR THE STATE THE NATION AND WE FEEL A SINCERE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADD KNOWLEDGE TO THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T. SO THAT SORT OF THE BROAD FRAMING -- OF OUR PROGRAMS -- OUR BRO BUT I WANT TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE OUR FIVE PROGRAMS AND ACTUALLY THINK YOU OFFER THE REALLY GREAT BACKGROUND PAPER -- THAT DESCRIBE THEM REALLY WELL I THINK IT'S A ON PAGES EIGHT TO TEN SO IF YOU. NEED MORE INFORMATION I THINK THAT FACT SHEETS AS WELL -- SO THE FIRST PROGRAM WE HAVE IS OUR CAL WORKS HOMELESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ALSO KNOWN AS AJ -- AJ IS OUR BRANCHES ONLY ENTITLEMENT BENEFIT PROGRAM. SERVING AROUND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND FAMILIES LAST YEAR FOR FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT BENEFITS. TO BE ELIGIBLE A FAMILY NEEDS TO BE AN APPLICANT OR RECIPIENT OF CAL WORKS. AND HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF AJ THAT WE ADMINISTER THE FIRST IS TEMPORARY HOMELESS ASSISTANCE WHICH PROVIDE THE PAYMENT OF EIGHTY FIVE DOLLARS PER DAY FOR A TEMPORARY SHELTER. FOR UP TO SIXTEEN CONDUCT CONSECUTIVE DAYS THEIR FORM OF HA WHICH HELPS THE FAMILY SECURE HOUSING BY PROVIDING SECURITY DEPOSITS OR HELPING A FAMILY MAINTAIN HOUSING BY PROVIDING UP TO TWO MONTHS A RENTAL EVERY REGIS. BOTH TYPES OF AJ ARE AVAILABLE ONCE IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE FACT YOU ALL HAVE -- THERE ARE ALSO HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS LEGISLATIVE CHANGES IN THE IN THE PROGRAM IN RECENT YEARS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM SO I WANT TO CALL THAT OUT -- AND THOSE THOSE CHANGES ARE LISTED IN THE FACT SHEET AS WELL. THAT'S PROGRAM IS OUR CAL WORKS HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM -- AGES P. IS NOW IN ITS FIFTH YEAR -- AND HAS GROWN DRAMATICALLY YEAR AFTER YEAR IT CURRENTLY IS A SEVENTY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM WITH FIFTY TWO PARTICIPATING COUNTIES IT IS A COMPETITIVE ALLOCATION -- AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES AN INCREASE OF THAT PROGRAM TO NINETY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS PROGRAM YOU MUST BE A HOMELESS CAL WORKS FAMILY. HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT SINCE AGES P. IS NOT AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM LIKE MANY OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS IN THAT DEPARTMENT. MOST COUNTIES THAT ARE RECEIVING FUNDING ARE CURRENTLY NOT SERVING THE FULL ELIGIBLE POPULATION -- AS YOU HEARD FROM JENNY A LITTLE BAD AGES P. DOES FOLLOW HOUSING FIRST MODEL IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO ASSIST FAMILIES WITHOUT PRECONDITIONS -- AND TO SECURE PERMIT HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND ALSO USES EVIDENCE BASED HOMELESS INTERVENTIONS MAINLY RAPIDLY HOUSING WHICH ISN'T THE ASCRIBED IS AN INTERVENTION THAT PROVIDES ANYWHERE FROM A MONTH TO TWENTY FOUR MONTHS OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE ALONG WITH VERY INTENSIVE HOUSING CASE MANAGEMENT -- THERE IS MORE DATA ON THE PROGRAM IN THE FACT SHE BUT I DO THINK IT'S WORTH FLAGGING THAT SINCE AGES P. -- HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED FIVE EARS AGO WE HAVE AND FIVE HUNDRED FAMILIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THIS PROGRAM AND HOW COUNTIES CONTINUE TO RAISE THE BAR AND INNOVATE AS IT GROWS. BRINGING FAMILIES HOME IS OUR IS OUR NEXT PROGRAM THE FH IS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM. WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDS AND A ONE TO ONE COUNTY MATCH WITH TWELVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE PARTICIPATING. THIS PROGRAM IS SET TO SUNSET AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR BE FH YOU MUST BE A CHILD WELFARE INVOLVES FAMILY EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. HOWEVER BE A FATE IS ALSO NOT AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM SO NOT ALL THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE CAN BE SERVED AND GIVEN NOT CDSS HAS PRIORITIZE. BASED ON VULNERABILITY EXPECTING COUNTIES TO SERVE LITERALLY HOMELESS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN OUT OF HOME CARE FIRST. WE HAVE AGE ALSO FOLLOW THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL AND USES EVIDENCE BASED HOMELESS INTERVENTIONS -- FAMILIES RECEIVE RAPIDLY HOUSING SERVICES OR FOR THOSE MORE VULNERABLE FAMILIES A CONNECTION TO A FAMILY REUNIFICATION PROGRAM VOUCHER THROUGH HAD ARE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THE A SIZE HAS ALSO HAS A PRO BONO RELATIONSHIP. WITH THE UC BERKELEY CALIFORNIA POLICY LAB IN THE CHILDREN'S DATA NETWORK OUT OF USC TO FORMALLY EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM WE APPRECIATE THAT IT IS A PILOT -- THIS EVALUATION INCLUDES A LINKING THIS HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA THAT JENNY WAS MENTIONING FROM ALL TWELVE COUNTIES WHICH IS NO SMALL FEAT AND WE BELIEVE THE FIRST TIME IN THE STATE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TAKEN CLASS PLACE. WITH THE RESULT OF THE FORMAL EVALUATION WON'T BE REALLY AVAILABLE UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR. PARTICIPATING COUNTIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY ATTRIBUTE THE FH WITH HELPING FAMILIES REUNIFY FAT FASTER AND WITH GREATER SUCCESS. ALSO GREAT PARTNERSHIPS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BETWEEN LOCAL CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS AND LOCAL HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SYSTEMS PARTICULARLY AROUND FINDING THOSE DEEPER LONGER TERM HOUSING INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE DIFFICULT WITH A PILOT PROGRAM. OF THE FAMILY'S HOUSE ABOUT ONE THIRD HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS RECEIVING EITHER PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OR IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING VOUCHER. AND COUNTIES ARE DEVELOPING MUCH STRONGER RELATIONSHIP HE WE WERE ACTUALLY REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT HAD AWARDED ADDITIONAL FAMILY UNIFICATION PROGRAM VOUCHERS THIS YEAR AND SIX OF OUR TOLL PARTICIPATING COUNTIES RECEIVED SO IT'S ACTORS. OUR NEXT PROGRAM IS OUR HOUSING DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM. H. DEATH -- FOR SHORT IS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM AS WELL WITH A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AND STATE FIND COUNTY ONE TO ONE MATCH MAY BE SENSING A TREND HERE. IT SUCH THAT WAS SET TO SUNSET NEXT FISCAL YEAR HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET DOES HAS A HAS DOES HAVE THE PROGRAM FUNDED AT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ON GOING -- CURRENTLY THERE ARE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROGRAM. STEP SERVES INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE DISABLED OR LIKELY DISABLED AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. GIVING HIGHEST PRIORITY TO THOSE THAT ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS AND THOSE RELY MOST HEAVILY ON STATE AND COUNTY FUNDED SERVICES. THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF FOUR CORE ELEMENTS. OUT REACH INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT DISABILITY BENEFIT ADVOCACY AND HOUSING SUPPORTS FOR ALL CLIENTS THAT ARE BEING SERVED TO PROGRAM. IT HAS REQUIRED A LOT OF COORDINATION AN EFFORT LOCALLY TO GET ALL PROGRAM COMPONENTS UP AND RUNNING BUT WE ARE TRYING TO SI SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM. THE NUMBER OF DISABILITY BENEFIT APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED AND THE RATE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO HELP CLIENTS FIND PERMANENT HIGH HOUSING ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE ALSO IN YOUR FACT SHEET. AND OUR LAST AND FINAL CDS THAT'S HOUSING PROGRAM IS HOME SAFE. HOME SAFE IS A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM AS WELL. FIND IT AT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS ALSO WITH THE COUNTY ONE TO ONE MATCH AND IT WAS JUST FUNDED THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR SO WE ARE JUST THE BEGINNING PHASES OF IMPLEMENTATION BUT WE ARE -- QUITE PLEASE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE R. P. OUT TO COUNTIES IN TRIBES APPLICATIONS RETURNED AND FUNDING FULLY ALLOCATED TO TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AS OF DECEMBER. SO WE POSTED INITIAL CONFERENCE CALL FOR THE BRING THOSE COUNTIES IN FOR THEIR FIRST LEARNING FORM IN MARCH. THE PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES CLIENTS HIS WHO ARE EXPERIENCE AND ARE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS DUE TO ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE NEGLECT. SOUTH NEGLECT OR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION WE EXPECT MANY COUNTIES USES FUNDING TO TARGET HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION WHICH WILL BE A FIRST FOR CSS FUNDING IN THIS WAY SAYS SOMETHING WE ARE EAGER TO TEST OUT -- THE STATUTE I WOULD POINT OUT DOES REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE THE PROGRAMS AND WE ARE IN THE PROGRESS OF FINALIZING EVALUATION DESIGN AND CONTRACT HE DETAILS WITH MARGOT WHO SHALL OUT OF UCSF WHO IS JUST A A REMARKABLE EXPERT IN ELDER HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS AND RESEARCH. SO MORE TO COME ON THIS PROGRAM AS WE IMPLEMENT BUT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT UP AND RUNNING QUITE QUICKLY. AND THAT'S ALL. FOR VERY MUCH LET'S -- OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE FOR MISS UP PUT A FOOT -- YOU MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA. AND IT LAST YEAR I HAD -- A BILL MOVING THROUGH THE PROCESS -- THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE -- TO TO COLLECT DATA FROM LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE AND AND PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO LOCALITIES -- IN THE LAST YEAR H. U. D. AS MADE A LOT OF STRIVE TO MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION SO -- WE DECIDED THAT. YOU MENTIONED -- THAT THERE STILL IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCALS AND THE STATE IS SECOND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I JUST WONDERED -- WHETHER THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE CURRENT BUDGET. IT ABSOLUTELY WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES -- WHAT WE WERE TASKED WITH WAS DOING ALL OF THE? DEVELOPMENT WORK -- INCLUDING ISSUING A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION TO VENDORS. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GATHER THE INFORMATION ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE -- BOTH PROGRAMMATIC LEE AND FISCALLY TO FIRST GET ACCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO THE LOCAL DATA THAT IS BEING COLLECTED SO MUCH ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR BILL LAST YEAR -- AS ALLEY MENTIONED SOME OF THAT WORK IS BEING DONE ON A PILOT BASIS -- OUR GOAL IN PHASE ONE WOULD BE TO EXPAND THAT SO THAT THAT ALL OF THE LOCAL CO SEES CONTINUES OF CARE WHO ARE GATHERING THAT. DATA -- THAT IS THAT'S THE DATA WOULD BE WERE CURRENTLY IT BYPASSES THE STATE AND GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT WOULD BE THE OPTION THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS COULD. PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE LEVEL HMIS ARE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS SO THAT THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT FIND IT CHALLENGING TO ADMINISTER THEIR OWN AGE MY US COULD INSTEAD PARTICIPATE. IN THE STATE LEVEL -- APPROACH HOWEVER WE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE THEIR OWN DATA MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE DOING X. EXCELLENT ANALYSIS ALREADY. THE GOAL REALLY IS TO DEVELOP THE ANALYTIC CAPACITY AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND BUT IT IS DEFINITELY FUNDING RIP BUDGET RELATED FUNDING RELATED AND I'D LIKE TO JUST NOT A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE TODAY BUT LOVE TO HEAR MORE ON WHAT THAT FUNNY NEED IS AND ENGAGE WITH A C. D. ABOUT THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING -- WITH THEM I ASKED TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO TO RESOLVE THIS -- IN THE COMING MONTHS ONE FINAL QUESTION -- TO MS -- NOT. THE GENDER. OF YOUR THE ONE PERSON HERE REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND IF I HAD TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ONE MAJOR THING CALIFORNIA. COULD FOCUS ON TO ADDRESS ARE HOMELESS CRISIS OF ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED WHAT WOULD BE THAT THING. SORT OF PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF OURS. I THINK THE I'M PROBABLY GONNA. COMBINE A LOT OF THINGS I SIDE INTO THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF COMMUNITIES HAVE A LOT OF THE RIGHT PIECES IN PLACE. BUT DON'T KIND OF HAVE THE RIGHT FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE A LOT OF SEPARATE PROGRAMS THAT SOME OPERATING VERY WELL -- AND SOME NOT PERFORMING AS WELL BUT THERE ISN'T AS AS ENOUGH ALIGNMENT IN EACH COMMUNITY -- IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE IDENTIFIED QUICKLY INTO SHELTER OR QUICKLY IN TO HOUSING AND THEN QUICKLY OUT OF SHELTER AND TO HOUSING SO IT'S THERE'S AN ALIGNMENT THAT'S MISSING IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES -- EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE SEPARATE PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETIMES HAVE ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN ONE AGENCY -- THE THE PIECES THAT I THINK ARE -- MISSING ARE THAT SORT OF COORDINATION ALL PROGRAMS KIND OF A LINE WITH THE SINGLE MINDED FOCUS A LASER FOCUS ON GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM INTO HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND SO THERE'S A PROGRAMS RUNNING IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS -- A LOT OF PROGRAM TO SAY THERE HOUSING FIRST BUT ACTUALLY HAVE A LOT OF BARRIERS OR HAVE DIFFICULTY AND A LOT OF SHELTERS THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED AND AND PROBABLY NEED MORE SUPPORT. OUT TO GET PEOPLE IN THE HOUSING AND TO HAVE THAT BACK IN SUPPORT SO THAT IT'S SORT OF GOOD SYSTEM SO ONCE THE IN IN MANY COMMUNITIES WE SEE WITH ALL THOSE PIECES THERE WHERE YOU HAVE A CRISIS RESPONSE ON HOUSING RESPONSE. PUT TOGETHER YOU CAN SEE PEOPLE KIND OF AT EXITING THE SYSTEM MUCH MORE QUICKLY AND SO PEOPLE ARE HOUSE AS QUICKLY AS THEY BECOME IT MAY BECOME HOMELESS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OTHER COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS I NEED TO STEP OUT FOR A FEW MINUTES SOME GUY IT GIVE THE GAVEL TO MY CULTURE. AND I THINK MADAM CHAIRMAN HAS A FEW QUESTIONS HERSELF. THANK YOU. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE HOUSING COMMITTEE AND THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE SHOWS THAT WE NEED MORE COLLABORATION -- HOUSE COLLABORATION -- WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WITH THE THE COUNCIL OF AND HOW DO YOU SEE IT AND DO YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AT THE TABLE THAT SHOULD TO BE. WELL WE HAVE ONE OF OUR COUNCIL MEMBERS HERE WITH US -- ALLEY SUDDEN -- AND WE DO HAVE PRESENTATION I THINK OF MOST OF THE MAJOR PROGRAMS. THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF MISSING. PARTNERS I THINK AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY EXTENDED AND INVITED IN INCLUDED THOSE PARTNERS IN THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP -- AND THOSE ARE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- PROGRAMS AND AND THAT'S REALLY A FOCUS ON AND A RECOGNITION OF THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE. INCLUDING STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS SERVE AT RISK -- IN TERMS OF HOW COORDINATION IS GOING. EAT IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE -- COORDINATION IS SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSIBILITIES THAT. THAT ARE DEPARTMENTS ARE ENGAGE IN EVERY DAY -- I'VE SEEN IN THE TEN YEAR THAT I'VE HAD WITH THE COUNCIL VERY ENGAGED COUNCIL -- VERY ACTIVELY INVOLVED WANTING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COUNCIL WORK ITSELF BUT ALSO MAKE THOSE CROSS DEPARTMENTS. DEPARTMENT CONNECTIONS. ON THE INTERAGENCY WORKING GROUP IS REALLY WHERE THE THE THE WORK CAN GET DONE IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE COLLABORATING AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED ACROSS. THOSE SILOS AND I THINK THE RECENT FIRE RECOVERY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAD WERE A GOOD EXAMPLE. THREE OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE STATE DEPARTMENTS ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. THAT'S SOCIAL SERVICES MY AGE CD AND THEN ALSO THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND SO WE WERE ABLE TO SORT OF FACILITATE SOME CONVERSATIONS IN THOSE MEETINGS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ALIGNED. TO HELP GIVE INPUT ON HOW -- HOMELESSNESS A CRITICALLY HOMELESSNESS. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE EITHER HOMELESS OR PRECARIOUSLY HOUSE PRIOR TO THE FIRE'S. HOW THOSE THE NEEDS OF THAT POPULATION COULD BE RECOGNIZED IN ADDRESSED IN THE OVERALL RESPONSES TO THE FIRES -- WE HOSTED ONE CONVERSATION WHICH WE HAD A REPRESENTATIVE FROM FEMA ALONG WITH THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM VENTURA WHO GAVE US SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM THEIR FIRES. IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FROM THE BUTTE COUNTY CONTINUUM OF CARE SAID REALLY FACILITATE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. THE ACTION OF COURSE TAKES PLACE IN THE DEPARTMENTS APART FROM HEAP. OF THE COUNCIL IS REALLY IN MOSTLY AN ADVISORY CAPACITY EXCEPT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING FIRST AND SO A LOT OF OUR JOB REALLY IS TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE LINKAGES ARE MADE. ON IT'S AN ONGOING EFFORT AND ONE THAT WE'RE ALL REALLY EXCITED ABOUT [inaudible] HERE. DR INSTEAD YOU TALKED ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SAID DR OWNS THE DOCTOR BUT TAKE THANK. YOU TALKED ABOUT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE -- AND THE THE MONEY THAT IS BEING SET ASIDE SPECIFICALLY FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF WHAT IS AVAIL OF WHAT IS THERE. AT DO YOU FIND. THAT THE VERY PEOPLE THAT NEED THE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ARE REQUESTING IT OR IS IT THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE. YEAH WE JUST ANNOUNCES ON THURSDAY SO WE HAVEN'T IN CORY'S JUST YET BUT WE DID A BIG PUSH IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL UNIVERSAL WHO ARE WILLING TO OFFER TO WRITE TO THE CONTINUES OF CARING COUNTY SO. WE'RE DOING VERY INTENSE PROACTIVE ENGAGEMENT ESPECIALLY TO THE UNDER RESOURCE AREAS SO -- I SHOULD ADD YOU KNOW WE WE WE CONVENE REGULAR DISCUSSIONS ALTHOUGH THEIR LITTLE ON HOLD WITH THE SHUT DOWN WITH HUD AND WITH SOME OTHER TECHNO SYSTEMS PROVIDERS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DUPLICATE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOME INTENSE EFFORTS AND SOME OF OUR BIGGER URBAN AREAS THAT ARE. MOST OUR BIGGEST -- HAVES AND HAVE SOME REALLY BIG NEED SO WE'RE TRYING NOT TO DUPLICATE WHERE WE CAN AND SO WE ALSO THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE SET UP. IS WE USE THOSE RESOURCES TO PROCURE CONSULTANTS OURSELVES AND WE'LL SEND THOSE CONSULTANTS AND EXPERTS TO THEM SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT STEPS IT'LL BE ENGAGEMENT WHEN THEY ASK -- FOR ASSISTANCE RIGHT WILL SAY OKAY THIS IS THE BEST PROVIDER FOR YOU BASED ON THAT NEED MAYBE TO SYSTEMS FLOW NEEDED. RIGHT AND SO THE ARM THIS PROVIDER CAN REALLY HELP YOU HERE MAYBE IT'S LIKE YOU'RE REALLY HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING WHAT HOUSING FIRST MEANS ON THE GROUNDS OF THIS PROVIDER SO -- AND THEN EXTEND THAT ASSISTANCE AS AS NEEDED -- AND IF WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF REQUESTS. ON THE SAME TOPIC FOR EXAMPLE WE MAY DO SOME MORE KIND OF PEER TO PEER OR GROUP FOR REGIONAL TYPE OF ASSISTANCE RIGHT CROSSING OKAY THIS IS A NEED THAT EVERYONE HAS AND SOLD WILL FROM TOOLS THERE SO. IT IS A NEW WAY IN WHICH WE'VE. PROVIDED TACKLE SO SINCE THE PAST TYPICALLY WE HAVE HEY HERE'S THE MONEY YOU GUYS FIGURED OUT SO. TRUTHFULLY THERE'S PROBABLY A LOT OF LOSS OF A LAWSUIT ALONG THOSE WAYS RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE THEN TURN FULL THAT THIS MODEL IS ACTUALLY THE SAME MODEL THAT A LOT OF FEDERAL AGENCIES PROVIDE TO STATES -- WE HOPE WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL GET SOME SOME GOOD RESULTS FROM THIS -- LIKE I SAID WE'RE DOING CORRECTIVE PROACTIVE OUT RICHARD ARE YOU TALK TO EXAMPLE BUTTE COUNTY EVEN IN ADVANCE OF THIS OUT REACH LIKE HEY WHATEVER YOU NEED. TELL US AND WE'LL IT'S THEIR THEY WILL DO THE SAME I THINK FOR FOR AS FAR AS ALL THE COUNTY THAT ARE ALL THE COUNTIES IF YOUR SEATS THEY'RE INTERESTED SO. I HOPE YOU WILL REPORT BACK YOU KNOW AND IF IT. TOO MUCH TIME OR WHATEVER IT IS -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE THESE RESOURCES UNTIL. MERE FOR THE COUPLE YEARS OR UNTIL THEY'RE EXHAUSTED AND SO -- I THINK I BILL REPORT BACK LIKE HERE'S PEOPLE ASKING. FOR ASSISTANCE WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE WILL BUILD COURSE GET REPORTS RECKON SOLD SO MAYBE NOT THE APPROPRIATE TIME WE CAN PROVIDE THOSE WONDERFUL. LET ME BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS YES SOME REMEMBER QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO ALL THE PANELISTS OF THREE QUESTIONS THAT ARE INTERRELATED SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND I THINK I'M GONNA BE ASKING -- I THINK -- MRS POWELL HOW THE FACT THAT -- IS THEIR DATA THAT SHOWS WHAT TOTAL AMOUNT OF HOUSING DOLLARS EACH COUNTY HAS RECIEVED -- JUST ON ALL. TYPES OF FUNDING SO NOT BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF CHARTS THAT SAY. HOW MANY COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING BUT A TOTAL AMOUNT OF DOLLARS? SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION. AND THEN SECONDLY -- IS THERE A COMPARISON OF NOT ONLY WHAT MONEY IS AVAILABLE BUT WHAT AT THE COUNTIES HAVE APPLIED FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE ONLY SEE ON NINE COUNTIES RECEIVING FUNDS DOES THAT MEAN A COUNTY JUST DIDN'T PARTICIPATE. OR THEY WERE NOT CHOSEN -- SO HOW DO WE KNOW IF THEY JUST HAVE AN IMPLIED. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HEAR THERE'S NO MONEY OR WE'RE NOT GETTING AT AND MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN APPLIED -- AND THEN. ALSO THERE WAS OF OF OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO LOOK AT COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USING SOME OF THEIR HOUSING FUNDS THAT COME TO THE STATE TO THE COUNTY -- AND I KNOW IT THE SAN DIEGO AND ORANGE COUNTY AND AN LOS ANGELES WERE PART OF THAT LIST THAT HAD ACCUMULATED QUITE A LOT OF FUNDS. AND MAYBE THEY HAVE PLANS FROM BUT THEY HAD IT BEEN USED SO THERE WAS -- LEGISLATION TO TRY TO MOVE THAT BACK INTO -- KIND OF A CENTRAL DOLLARS AND HAVE A MARIE APPLY -- KIND OF THE USE IT OR LOSE IT MODEL -- DO WE HAVE RECORD OF HOW THAT'S BEING HANDLED SO THAT'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS SOMEONE SAW JUST THROW THOSE ALL OUT. TO WHOEVER FILLED I'LL START AND THEN HANDED OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES IF I MAY UM. THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT IS CURRENTLY GOING OUT TO OR THE COUNTIES HAVE ACCESS. TO WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA COLLECTED. ACTIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO IDENTIFY TO GET A REALLY CLEAR PICTURE OF OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S GOING TO THE VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS. AND THEN THOSE THE WHAT'S WHAT WHAT'S FOCUSED ON HOUSING OR HOUSING RELATED SERVICES. IT CAN BE MORE CHALLENGING THAN IT MIGHT APPEAR TO DEVELOP THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE A LOT OF PROGRAMS. ARE NOT. REALLY BLACK AND WHITE EITHER THEY'RE IN ARE THERE OUT THERE PERHAPS IT'S AN OPTION TO PROVIDE HOUSING AND HOUSING SUPPORTS OR PART OF THE POPULATION THAT THE SERVICE IS HOMELESS OR AT RISK. SO WE'RE REALLY WANTING TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN BE ACCURATE IN WHATEVER INFORMATION WE GATHER AND AND THEN PUBLICIZE. THE FIRST STEP WAS IN IN DOING THE TWO BROCHURES WHICH ACTUALLY -- H. C. D. INITIATED TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND WHAT KINDS OF SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE FROM THE FUND -- LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR MORE ON I MEAN NOBODY ELSE HE WAS -- FOR OUR PATH BOND PROGRAMS WE DO HAVE THE PROPER SIX PROP ONE SEE WE HAVE EXPENDED ANYTHING FROM PROP ONE OF COURSE YET WE DO HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT HAS GONE TEACH COUNTY FROM THIS PROGRAMS. NOW THAT CAPITAL SAY IS MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS GO DIRECTLY TO DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING WITHINTHOSE KINDS OF DON'T. FUNDS GOING TO COUNTIES -- IT'S IT'S SO IT'S DEVELOPMENT OR RESOURCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT DO FLOATED CONTINUES OF CARING COUNTIES THAT I MENTIONED -- AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU TO WE SEE EVERY. TEAM OF CARE OR COUNTY ACCESS THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HAD THAT PROBLEM WITH THE LEAST THE PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY -- AND LACK OF ACCESS -- I THINK IT'S THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE MAYBE MORE LIMITED IN FUNDS THAT ARE COMPETITIVE THAT -- THAT HAVE THAT HAVE SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES RIGHT BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE BASING POLICY PRIORITIES AND WHATEVER WHICHEVER APPLICATIONS YOUR BEST SUITED FOR ME HAVE THE MOST LEVERAGE FROM LOCAL RESOURCE STANDPOINT OF SORTS OF THINGS. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LEGISLATION YOU TALKED ABOUT SO -- I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WAS -- BILL THAT WAS ACTUALLY HE STEPPED OUT OF THE ROOM ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA BROUGHT LAST JUNE. AND IT WAS -- THE LAST DAY OF SESSION IN JUNE AND IT WAS. TO TAKE. A LOOK AT THE COUNTIES THAT WERE NOT USING THEIR HOUSING DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR THREE OH AT LEAST THREE YEARS AND MARK BEING USED AND TO PUT THEM -- IN ESSENCE INTO ONE TYPE OF MAYBE THE MIDDLE SERVICES ACT DOLLARS YES OF THE HOUSING DOLLARS OKAY SO MAYBE MAYBE THIS FUNDS YES SO WE ARE HEALTHCARE SERVICES WERE PROBABLY THE BEST SUITED ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH AND JUST ON ON ARE PROGRAMS AROUND THAT -- IMPLYING AND AND THOSE PIECES SO -- MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE COMPETITIVE THEY ARE NOT -- SORT OF IS THAT THE FUNDING CANNOT BE SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE THEY'RE YOU KNOW I AGES P. AS ARE ONLY PROGRAM THAT I THINK IN THEORY IS IS PRETTY MUCH STATEWIDE AT THIS POINT -- I WOULD MENTION I MEAN WE DO HAVE MANY MORE APPLICANTS THAN I MEAN AT FOR FOR H. STAFF -- WE'D WE HAD THE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES FOR FOR ARE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM WE HAD ALMOST DOUBLE THE TWELVE THAT GOT FUNDED BUT WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THAT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR -- I ALSO WOULD MENTION I THINK JUST [inaudible] FOR YOU KNOW. TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION THAT THE COUNTY ONE TO ONE MATCH -- IT CAN BE A BARRIER FOR UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND SO WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME I TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRYING TO HELP COUNTIES THINK THROUGH WHERE THEY COULD GET THOSE MATCH DOLLARS FROM. THANK YOU KEPT. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP THEN AT THIS POINT THERE ISN'T TO KIND OF A ONE DATABASE THAT WOULD SHOW HOW MANY DOLLARS -- EACH COUNTY IS RECEIVING OR APPLYING. FOR NOT CURRENTLY ALTHOUGH IT IS ON OUR LIST OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD. IDEALLY LIKE TO TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO SO HOPEFULLY IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION THANK YOU BUTTON NOT ANY TIME REALLY SAFE AND THANK YOU. UNLESS THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES IT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AUTUMN WILL. SO FIRST AB ONE ACTUALLY THINK THE STAFF WHO HELPED PUT THIS TOGETHER ON ONE OF THE RARE PEOPLE WHO DOES ENJOY READING IT AND PROCESSING IT AND ONE OF THE LINES I REALLY LIKED WAS THAT. HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND ACUTE ILLNESSES. WHICH IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH WERE EXACERBATED BY THEIR LIVING SITUATIONS. WORKING IN AN E. R. FOR TEN YEARS MICHAEL WHERE PEOPLE CYCLE THROUGH EMERGENCY ROOMS JAILS TO BEING HOMELESS. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE STYLING OF THIS INFORMATION. I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE AREAS I WORK WITH AND THAT'S WITH YOU ALLEY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND HOME OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND WHAT WE CAN DO -- I WAS IMPRESSED THAT LAST YEAR WE INCREASED HOMELESS ASSISTANCE WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY INCREASE THE RATES TO MEET THE CURRENT DEMANDS. AND THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THE H. TAPPED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN. BETTER. WORK WITH A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL. I WANTED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT AND WE'LL FOLLOW UP IF I CAN WITH THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM. AS FRESNO COUNTY WAS NOT ONE OF THE TWELVE COUNTIES WHICH WAS INCLUDED AND HOW MANY OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES TO STRUGGLE. WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE MORE DESIGNED -- FOR OUR URBAN AREAS -- AND I AM QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR AND FINALLY ARE STARTING TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE SUCCESSFUL. BUT IT IS THE SILO BRING UP INFORMATION. THERE'S A RAND REPORT THAT COMES IN THIS STUDY THAT AT SOME POINT I WISH WE WOULD LOOK AT A LARGER FISCAL ANALYSIS. WHICH SAID THAT THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR INVESTING IN HOMELESS PROGRAMS HELPS US TO SAVE HEALTHCARE DOLLARS. THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND IT'S A DOLLAR AND TOTAL SPENDING THAT THEY COULD FOLLOW. I BET IF YOU DUG A BIT FURTHER YOU WOULD ACTUALLY REALIZE THAT HELPING TO DO HOUSING FIRST HELP US AS A STATE TO HELP SAVE MONEY. AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING THOSE DISCUSSIONS THROUGH OUR BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AND THROUGH HUMAN SERVICES. TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES.

CHAIRPERSON WAS HERE SO WE CAN HAVE A SOME HONEST -- DISCUSSION HOW WE CAN. IMPROVE THE SITUATION. RATHER THAN JUST AND DOING THE WORK. AND THE SITUATION CASTS A WORSE AND EVERY YEAR. ARE WE TAKING IT SERIOUSLY -- I JUST ON ALL THE AGENCIES TO BROCK RECEIVED THEY TO THE A JOB BY [inaudible] AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT. SO IS SO REALLY FRUSTRATING TO ME. S. -- MEMBER OF DISA. COMMITTEE HOW WE CAN TACKLE. AND THEN ALSO -- MEMBER QUIRK SILVA ONE LOCAL MENTIONED THAT THE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY. SHE DIDN'T MENTION THE COUNTY WHERE JOHNNY -- AGENCY. KEPT THAT MONEY. AND I'M NOT SPENDING. UNTIL THE LAST OF CRISIS -- THAT THE THE PEOPLE RURAL FROM THE RIVER BED WERE CHECKED ON ME AND TOOK OUT THE AND THE THERE'S KNOWN. MONITORING CHECK AND BALANCE OF WHAT IS BEING DONE THE MONEY IS A BEING SPENT THE BUT THE WHERE THE MONEY IN ARE ACTUALLY GOALS. YEAH. THERE'S A KNOLL. I WISH I WAS THE GOVERNOR. I CAN HAVE A MY YET TASK FORCE. AND THE FOCUS ON AND TRIED IMPROVE THE SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IS THERE OF ARE JUST TAKING IT AS SELF JUST A FACT OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY DON'T. KNOW THEY ARE THEY ARE WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS THE APPROACH WE SHOULD TAKE. WE SHOULD REALLY FOCUS UPON HOW WE SOLVE THAT THE PROBLEM. IT IS SO SHAME MATTER YOU MENTIONED THE IT HERE SACRAMENTO. WE TALK ABOUT THIS -- ALMOST DAILY WHEN WE MEET THE IN THE COMMITTEES SO HOMELESSNESS -- SITUATION AND YOU KNOW HOUSING SITUATION AFFORDABLE HOMES ETCETERA ETCETERA JUST ACROSS THE STREET [inaudible] RIGHT THERE. WE CANNOT EVEN SOLVE. THE CAPITAL CITY OF HOMELESSNESS -- SITUATION. WHY CAN'T WE JUST TO CREATE A? TRIED DIFFERENT METHODS TO HOWL. AT THE STATE LOCAL COUNTY ALL AGENCIES SO. THE ARE WORKING TO GET THE WHAT METHOD -- WORKER AND THEN CREATE THE THE SYSTEM THAT WOULD WORK FROM OUR VERY CITY HERE IN THE CAPITAL CITY. AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT CHOICE I THINK THAT THAT IS. WHY WE'RE HERE YEAH THE AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THE FEDERAL RESPONSE THE STATE RESPONSE AND THE NEXT PANEL WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE LOCAL RESPONSE IT IS AN ISSUE THAT CLEARLY? HAS AFFECTED ALL OF US. AND I THINK THAT HAVING TASK HAVING SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THE FACT THAT THE HOUSING. COMMITTEE AND THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE HAS SAID THIS IS BIGGER THAN JUST HOUSING WE HAVE TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO HELP SOLVE THIS. WE WANT TO BRING IN THE EXPERTS BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERT TO HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND THE OF THE DO WORKING ON THIS AND HAVE HAD GREAT SUCCESSES. WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO BE DONE AND I THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN THAT WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH MORE WORK I THINK AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA HAS. INDICATED THAT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT GOES TO YOUR POINT AS WELL. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT. WHAT OUR EXPERTS ARE SHARING WITH US SO THAT WE CAN THEN? DETERMINE WHAT LEGISLATION NEEDS TO BE INTRODUCED OR WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A SERIOUS ISSUE I JUST. JUST AS CHAIRMAN -- AND DAVID CHIU SAID IT'S A MORAL CRISIS THE MORE KIND OF CRISIS OF THE DAY. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO TAKE THE WE ARE NOT TAKING IT AS A CRISIS WE NORTH OF FACTORS SO IT IS SO SITUATION WE CAN CALL IT THAT SO CRISIS ABOUT THE LACK OF A BUDGET REFLECTION IN THE POLICY AND ON ACTIONS ARE WE TAKING YOU TACKLE IT. THAT'S A CRISIS I THINK THAT'S A FAIR COMMENT AND I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM OUR FROM OUR EXPERTS BUT I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT IS INTRODUCED. YOU KNOW FROM OUR VARIOUS EVEN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL -- AT THE CITY LEVEL -- SO IMPORTANT SO IMPORTANT AND IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING THAT WE SIMPLY THROW MONEY AT IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS RESULTS. AND MANY OF YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE RESULTS BUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THE MONEY JUST FLOWING AND WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT. IT THAT WE COORDINATE SO THAT WE'RE NOT ALL. EVERYBODY RECEIVES MONEY GOES TO THE SAME GROUP IT HAS TO BE TAKEN IF WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE ENTIRE SITUATION -- BUT WHICH AGENCY WILL HAVE US TO TO DATE ON THAT OUT OF A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SELF LAST YEAR -- HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT THE FOR ADMINISTRATION? AGENCIES SO WORKING IN ALL. PEOPLE LIKE YOU. WELL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY HOW MUCH MONEY HAS GONE INTO THE HOUSING ITSELF AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SEE. OUR BONUS -- A SITUATION TO ACTUALLY HOUSING AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CYNTHIA. THAT THOUGH FROM MOSHE'S DURING. TO HOSTING. I'M INTERPRETING AS LIKE A GROUP OF SHELTERING I WISH WE CAN HAVE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING ON THE STREET? YOU KNOW THOUSANDS. AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE IN THE IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LOW A SWEEPING INDUSTRY SAID NASH EVEN CHECK. TO AND THOSE ARE THE STATISTICS WERE HEARD FOR ABOUT AT THE VERY BEGINNING AND THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE AND EVEN THOSE NUMBERS ARE INACCURATE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT ARE. ON SHELTERED AND SHELTERED THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I THINK YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AHEAD AT OUR AGENDA BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT. IS THAT GAP WE HAVEN'T RESOLVED THIS WE HAVEN'T SOLVED THE ISSUE SO I IF I MAY I'D LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL THAT HAS PRESENTED. AND I'D LIKE TO CALL UP THE NEXT PANEL. FOR THE LOCAL RESPONSE ONE THANK YOUR ALL RIGHT I'M A MOM A TO A LOT [inaudible] YEAH. WELL VERY GOOD WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME MICHELLE. SMITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF KINGS TULARE HOMELESS ALLIANCE CONTINUE OF CARE. AND CHRISTINA MILLER DEPUTY MAYOR FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES THANK YOU BOTH AND ELS CHAIR. TO REQUESTED OF THE PRIOR PANEL WILL LAST THAT WE GO IN THE ORDER THAT THEY ARE THAT YOU ARE LISTED. MICHELLE SMITH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRPERSON GOMEZ REYES AND IT WOULD SAY THAT CHAIR PERSON TOO BUT IT'S NOT. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF RURAL AND SMALLER CAN COMMUNITY HOMELESSNESS AND CALIFORNIA -- MICHELLE SMITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE AND WE SERVE AS THE LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR KINGS AND TULARE COUNTIES. WE ARE A STANDALONE NONPROFIT THAT STARTED AS A GRASS ROOTS ORGANIZATION IN. NINETEEN NINETY NINE WE ARE SIMILAR TO A 25% OF CIOS HE'S ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHICH ARE STANDALONE NONPROFITS. KINGS THE TELLER COUNTIES COVER SIXTY TWO HUNDRED SQUARE MILES INCLUDING TO NATIONAL PARKS SIXTY SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS TWELVE CITIES AND LARGE SWATHS OF UNINCORPORATED AREAS THAT INCLUDE SOMETIMES BREAKING FOR CHICKENS WERE ROOSTERS AS YOU'RE DRIVING TO WORK. DIFFERENT KIND OF TRAFFIC JAM. SURPRISINGLY NEITHER COUNTY FIT WITHIN THEIR WORLD DEFINITION FOR MOST PURPOSES. ACCORDING TO THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT THERE ARE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT IN THE BY COUNTY REGION. WHILE THE BY COUNTY REGION HAS A COMBINED AND SHELTER RATE OF 67% THERE ARE A FEW CITIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND SHELTERED. RATE 99% OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY OF TULARE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE ON SHELTERED ONLY 1% ARE SHELTERED. 78% ON SHELTERED IN THE CITY OF PORTERFIELD AND 74% IN THE CITY OF HANFORD THIS IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN AND FIVE THE REST OF THE STATE AVERAGE. SINCE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESS IN KINGS IN TO LARRY SPEND AN AVERAGE OF FOUR AND A HALF YEARS HOMELESS. WE'RE LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THE HIGHEST NEED HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR COMMUNITY SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COORDINATED ENTRY. NOW PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST NEEDS ARE BEING TRIAGE FOR HOUSING OR OTHER RESOURCES. PEOPLE WE ENCOUNTER OFTEN DISCONNECTED FROM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITH SOME TOO SICK FOR MANY. OF OUR HOUSING PROJECTS. LAST FALL THREE PEOPLE WITH HOUSING VOUCHERS DIED WHILE WAITING TO GET INTO HOUSING. AND ONE WAS BEAT TO DEATH IN JAIL. ANOTHER HADN'T RECEIVED MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THIRTY YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NO ALTERNATE OFF FOLKS THE HOMELESS SYSTEM HAS BECOME THE FAIL SAFE WHEN ALL OTHER SYSTEMS HAVE FAILED THESE PEOPLE. FOR THOSE WHO'VE BEEN ASSESSED FOR HOUSING THE BY COUNTY AVERAGES THREE HUNDRED AND FOUR DAYS TO HOUSE STE. THIS SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IS DUE TO THE LACK OF HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE IN OUR REGION ON AVERAGE WE HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE VOUCHERS AVAILABLE PER MONTH. WELL WE HAVE MANY CHALLENGES WE ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE TREMENDOUS SUCCESSES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN WE HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BATON OUR REGION BY 85%. ARE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SYSTEM HAS A 94% SUCCESS RATE IN RETENTION AND EXITS TO PERMANENT HOUSING. RAPID RE HOUSING ON THE OTHER HAND IS MORE OF A STRUGGLE WITH ONLY 31% EXITING TO PERMANENT HOUSING. WHILE RAPIDLY HOUSING IS A GREAT INTERVENTION FOR SOME HOUSEHOLDS IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE POVERTY ISSUES FACED BY SO MANY IN OUR REACH AND WE CAN GET A HOUSEHOLD CONNECTED TO BENEFITS WHICH EQUATE TO APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND THEY STILL CAN'T AFFORD OR SUSTAIN HOUSING WITH THE ASSISTANCE ENDS. AS WITH MOST COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST GAP WE EXPERIENCE IS AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO SECURE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS INCLUDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. MANY OF THE REGULATIONS FAVOR URBAN PROJECTS NGUYEN SMALLER COMMUNITY SIMPLY CANNOT COMPETE. IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM PROJECTS AND HANFORD A COMMUNITY WITH A POPULATION OF ROUGHLY FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND WOULD COMPETE AGAINST PROJECTS IN LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO. IN THE INTEGRATED CONNECTIVE ITTY PROJECT TERRY AT THE NO PLACE LIKE HOME REGULATIONS THEN CAN ONLY ASSIST 49% OF THE UNITS. SMALLER COMMUNITIES WITHOUT SECTION EIGHT WERE SUBSTANTIAL LOCAL MONEY CANNOT MAKE 4% PROJECTS WORK WHICH FORCES THEM INTO THE 9% PROGRAM AND MAKES THEM INHERENTLY LESS COMPETITIVE FOR NO PLACE LIKE HOME FUNDING. REMOVING THE LIMITATION ON WEARING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF H. CD FUNDS ON THE SAME UNIT WOULD IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADDITIONAL 4% TAX CREDITS IN THE VALLEY. KINGS UNTIL LARRY COUNTIES ARE NON ENTITLEMENT AREAS FOR THE PURPOSES OF FEDERAL EMERGENCY GRANT. FUNDING EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS GRANT FUNDING THOSE FUNDS GO FROM THE FROM HYDE TO THE STATE WHERE A LOCAL NO FOR COMPETITION TAKES PLACE. CEO SEES HAVE TO COMPETE FOR THE MONEY ALLOCATED TO THEIR REGION AND THE STATE PUTS A LIMIT OF TWO PROJECTS PER CO SEE THAT CAN BE SUBMITTED. THE LACK OF LOCAL CONTROL OF THESE FUNDS CREATE UNSTABLE PROJECTS THAT OFTEN CLOSE WITHIN TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN OPENED. OUR REGION IS GREATLY IMPACTED BY THIS PROCESS WHICH CAN BE CORRECTED BY A SIMPLE REDESIGN OF THE PROCESS AND MIGHT I ADD NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE STATE. ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE EXPERIENCE IS THE COST IN EXCESS ABILITY OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES IT IS OFTEN A LARGE BARRIER FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN KINGS COUNTY IT CAN TAKE AN ENTIRE DAY TO GET TO THE COUNTY SEAT USING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. AND CAN COST NEARLY TEN DOLLARS TO TRAVEL BETWEEN CITIES TO ACCESS CERTAIN SERVICES. WE ALSO HAVE A LACK OF MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL SUPPORTS FOR PEOPLE ADDICTED TO METH AMPHETAMINES I KNOW THAT'S OT A SEXY WERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BUZZ IS OPIOIDS RIGHT NOW. BUT IN OUR REGION -- WE PRODUCE OVER 90% OF THE COUNTRY'S METHAMPHETAMINE GET THERE A FEW SUPPORTS FOR THE PEOPLE AFFLICTED WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE STRONG. THE HEAT FUNDING HAS BEEN A TREMENDOUS SUCCESS FOR OUR REGION SO THANK YOU. HAVING THE FUNDING GO THROUGH THE C. O. C. PROCESS WHO HAS BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR REGION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY ELEVEN THE CEO SEE THAT OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE LOOKING TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF LOW BARRIER EMERGENCY HOUSING. AND BRIDGE PROJECTS THEY'RE BEGINNING TO EMBRACE HOUSING FIRST PRINCIPLES. I JUST LIKE TO PAUSE THERE BECAUSE I FIND THAT TO BE AMERICAL. THESE REGIONS ARE COMING TO THE TABLEWITH THEIR OWN FUNDS WHICH WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED WITHOUT THIS INNOVATIVE FUNDING. LAST NIGHT HE FUNDING KEPT EIGHTY FIVE ADULTS AND FOR CHILDREN SAFE. IN A LOW BARRIER FORMING CENTER IN VICE CELAYA. THESE FOLKS WOULD HAVE HAD NO WHERE ELSE TO GO. THE WARMING CENTER IS AN INTERIM SOLUTION WHILE PLANNING IS UNDER WAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOW BARRIER EMERGENCY SHELTER. THIS PROJECT CREATED THE FORUM FOR THE LOCAL HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DOES TO DISPATCH PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS WORKERS AND YOUTH SERVICE PROVIDERS TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE THAT DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SERVICES. THE FLEXIBILITY IF HE AND THE CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY SOLUTIONS HOUSING PROGRAM CASH HAVE PROVIDED OUR REGION WITH RESOURCES THAT ENABLE US TO LEVERAGE NEW. AND EXISTING PROGRAMS WHO ARE SO FOR SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS EXAMPLES INCLUDE OUR FIRST EVER LOCAL COLLABORATIVE NO FOR PROCESS. THIS NO FOR INCLUDES HE CASH AND THE HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL OUTREACH AND TREATMENT PROGRAM WITH THEIR LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THIS COLLABORATION IS SET THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE ISSUANCE OF FUTURE COMBINED OFFICE WHICH WE HAVE A LOVINGLY NAMED PHIL. YOU CAN ASK ME ABOUT THAT LATER. WE RECENTLY PARTNERED WITH THE HOUSING IS IN HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO LEVERAGE TO PROGRAMS THE MAINSTREAM VOUCHER PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH HIDE AND THE HOMELESS DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM H. DOT. THIS PARTNERSHIP COMBINES FORTY FIVE PERMANENT HOUSING VOUCHERS FOR NON ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THE EXPERTISE OF THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES TEAM TO CONNECT THESE CLIENTS TO MAINSTREAM BENEFITS INCLUDING SOCIAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE. THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES OF THE STRONG PARTNERSHIPS AND COMMUNITY WELL TO LEVERAGE EVERY RESOURCE AVAILABLE TO OUR REGION. WE HOPE THAT YOU CONSIDER CONTINUED FUNDING THROUGH THE C. O. C. PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM OF THESE PROGRAMS THANK YOU. I'M GOOD MORNING HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT MY NAME IS CHRISTINA MILLER AND THE DEPUTY MAYOR OF CITY HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. IT WAS LESS THAN ONE MONTH AGO THAT MAYOR GARCETTI CREATED THE OFFICE OF HOMELESSNESS INITIATIVES AN ACTION THAT MEANS TO FURTHER UNDERSCORE. HOW IMPORTANT ENDING HOMELESSNESS IS AND HOW IS THE TOP PRIORITY OF HIS OFFICE AND OF THE CITY? OUR POLICY TEAM IS TASK OF DRIVING THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS THROUGH INCREASED FOCUS CREATIVITY. AND ACCELERATION OF OF AFFECTED PROGRAMMING. NOTHING DESERVES MORE URGENCY AND SOLVING THIS CRISIS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF ANGELS. I AM PROUD TO SHARE WHAT HAD OCCURRED ON THE LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL. THE CITY HAS COME A VERY LONG WAY AND IT'S COMMITMENT AND INVESTMENT TO SOLVING HOMELESSNESS. THIS FISCAL YEAR ALONE FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION% DOLLARS WAS DEDICATED FOR HOMELESSNESS AND HOUSING. COMPARED TO EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE ARE ALLOCATING RESOURCES NEARLY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE TIMES THE SIZE AS BEFORE. AND 7070% OF WHICH IS FOR PERMANENT HOUSING PROJECTS. THE COUNTY AND CITY TOGETHER HAVE PASSED HISTORIC BALLOT MEASURES THAT TOGETHER WILL BRING UP FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION THAT IS BILLION WITH A B.. OF RESOURCES TO THE REGION OVER TEN YEAR. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THESE ARE EARLY SIGNS THAT ARE SOLUTIONS WERE WORKING. THE CITY SOUGHT A 6% DECREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AND THAT WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NINE YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE CREATED IN NEEDED PIPELINE FOR DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. BUT AS ONE CONSTITUENT POINTED OUT TO US A PERSON CANNOT LIVE IN A PIPELINE. IN MY TEN YEARS OF WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS FIRST AS A DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDER I'VE WATCHED THE EVOLUTION OF THE CRISIS AND SUBSEQUENT SOLUTIONS UNFOLD. AS A CASE MANAGER I REMEMBER SITTING ACROSS THE TABLE FROM A MOTHER WITH SEVEN CHILDREN. I'M IN A TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PROJECT AND AFTER SEVERAL DENIALS FROM DISABILITY BENEFITS THIS IS DESPITE CLEAR AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS BEING PRESENT -- AND INSUFFICIENT INCOME TO SUPPORT FAIR MARKET RENT BUT NO RENTAL SUBSIDY INSIGHT I JUST HAD TO TELL HER TO WAIT. MAYBE SHE WOULD GET LUCKY AND RECEIVE A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER IN THE FUTURE. HER LIFE AND THE LIVES OF HER CHILDREN HINGED ON LOCK. THE LOS ANGELES CAN TEAM OF CARE SO HOMELESSNESS RISE AN ALARMING RATE. COUNTY Y. TOTALS HOVERED AROUND. THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND THEN ROSE TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE THOUGHT HOMELESSNESS RISE FOR KEY VULNERABLE GROUPS. WOMEN OLDER ADULTS TRANSITION AGE YOUTH. AND YEAR AFTER YEAR BLACK AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ANGELENOS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE. THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE MAIN CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS ATTRIBUTED TO ECONOMIC DRIVERS AND HOUSING AFFORDABILITY OR IN AFFORDABILITY I SHOULD SAY. BUT REALIZE THAT THE LONGER SOMEONE LIVED ON THE STREETS AND BECAME CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THE HARDER IT WAS TO RESOLVE THEIR HOMELESSNESS. AND THERE WAS VERY VERY VERY FEW EMERGENCY HOUSING RESOURCES TO SEND PEOPLE TO AND THERE STILL ARE TODAY. BUT A RESPONSE TO THE GROWING CRISIS WAS EMERGING ALTHOUGH IT'S STRUGGLE TO KEEP PACE WITH THE GROWING NUMBERS. AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND TEN AT INITIATIVE LED BY UNITED WAY LA CALL HOME FOR GOOD. LATEST STRONG FOUNDATION FOR COORDINATED EFFORTS TO COME AROUND CHRONIC AND VETERANS HOMELESSNESS SPECIFICALLY. HOME FOR GOOD CREATED THE FUNDERS COLLABORATIVE WHICH BECAME A CLEARING HOUSE FOR A LINE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENTS. AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SEED FUNDING FOR LA'S COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM OR SI ES. WHICH LAUNCHED IN. TWENTY THIRTEEN GARCETTI ADOPTED THE GOALS OF HOME FOR GOOD AND ACCEPTED THE MAY ORAL CHALLENGED AND VETERANS HOMELESSNESS THAT AT NATIONAL CHALLENGE. IN LATE TWENTY FIFTEEN WHILE THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF SI ESTAS BEING FORTIFIED AND EXISTING RESOURCES STITCH TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT THEY HAD NEVER BEEN COORDINATED BEFORE. THE CITY APPROVED ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INFUSION OF DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN BUDGET. IT ALSO ADOPTED THE COMPREHENSIVE HOMELESSNESS STRATEGIES A SET OF SIXTY TWO STRATEGIES GROUNDED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF NO WRONG DOOR. HOUSING FIRST PREVENTION AND COORDINATED CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. THE COUNTY ALSO ADOPTED A SET OF STRATEGIES IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THIS CREATED THE BASE PLAN FOR HOW WE WOULD REGIONALLY TACKLE THE CRISIS. I EMPHASIZE REGIONAL. I'M IN A PLANE IS GREAT AND SO IS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF EMERGENCY FUNDS BUT WE NEEDED LOCAL SUSTAINABLE FUNDING STREAMS FOR BOTH HOUSING AND SERVICES IF WE WERE TRULY GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN LA. SO IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY'S HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY COMMITTEE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO FINALIZE PROPOSAL OF PROPOSITION HHH WHICH WAS PASSED WITH OVER 70% VOTER APPROVAL. IN NOVEMBER. HHH IS A ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR BOND AUTHORITY AIMED AT CREATING TEN THOUSAND UNITS OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS. IT WAS NOT MEANT TO FUND THE ENTIRETY OF THESE UNITS BUT AIM TO MORE THAN TRIPLE THE PACE AT WHICH LA CITY WAS CURRENTLY BUILDING. SINCE NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CITY'S PIPELINE OF PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE PSH HAS GROWN TO SEVENTY EIGHT DEVELOPMENTS WITH A TOTAL OF FIVE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FOUR UNITS. OF WHICH THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETEEN ARE SUPPORTIVE. WE'VE BROKEN GROUND ON EIGHT PROJECTS WITH MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED UNITS ON THE WAY TO COMPLETION. TO BUILD THE PIPELINE AND EXPEDITE THE PRODUCTION OF PSH IN LOS ANGELES WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THREE NEW LAND USE INITIATIVES THAT REMOVE MAJOR REGULATORY BARRIERS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. LIKE REMOVING MINIMUM PARKING STANDARDS. AND REQUIREMENTS AND STRICT DENSITY ON AND AT THEY ARE LIMITS ALLOWING MANY PROJECTS TO BE PERMITTED BY RIGHT. WE'VE ALSO PUT OUT A BID TO DOZENS OF CITY OWNED PARCELS FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND PARTNERED WITH PHILANTHROPY TO DOUBLE OUR FREE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION LOAN FUND. TO HELP MISSION DRIVEN DEVELOPERS COMPETE IN THE PRIVATE MARKET FOR LIMITED LAND. IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COUNTY PASSED MEASURE AGE THE QUARTER CENT SALES TAX AIMED TO RAISE THREE A FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN TAX REVENUE FOR HOMELESS SERVICES EXCLUSIVELY. SO WE HAD A PLAN AND WE HAVE A RESORT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO FUND THE PLAN. WILL REMAIN ON THE STREETS. AND WE CANNOT IN GOOD CONSCIENCE TELL PEOPLE THEY SIMPLY HAVE TO WAIT ON THE SIDEWALK FOR OUR PLANS TO COME INTO FRUITION. SO NINE MONTHS AGO GARCETTI ANNOUNCED A BRIDGE HOME IT'S INITIATIVE TO ERECT FIFTEEN NEW TEMPORARY EMERGENCY HOUSING PROJECTS ONE IN EACH COUNCIL DISTRICT. THAT WOULD CREATE FIFTEEN HUNDRED NEW SHELTER BRIDGE HOUSING BEDS LOCATED NEAR PEOPLE AND HEAVILY CONCENTRATED ENCAMPMENTS. THE CITY HAS DECLARED A SHELTER CRISIS PURSUANT TO EIGHTY NINE THIRTY TWO WHICH HAS ALLOWED US TO PASS EMERGENCY BUILDING AND SAFETY REGULATIONS. THAT ALLOW SHELTERS TO BE BUILT MORE QUICKLY OUR LOCAL ZONING CODE TO MAKE SHELTERS ON CITY OWNED OR CITY LEASE LAND BY RIGHT. ANYWHERE IN OUR CITY. WE PASSED LOCAL ORDINANCES TO STREAMLINED APPROVALS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECTS AND MOTEL CONVERSIONS. AND HOPE TO UTILIZE LEGISLATION PASSED BY SHERMAN ISSUE I AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL WHICH CREATED A STATEWIDE STREAMLINING FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AS WELL. THE BRIDGE HOME PROGRAM HAS SINCE EVOLVED TO INCLUDE THE REHAB OF EXISTING BUILDINGS PAYMENT OF LEASES TO PRIVATE OWNERS. AND FUNDING OF SERVICE PROVISION WHERE THE IDENTIFIED CAP WHERE WE HAVE IDENTIFIED COUNTY GAPS. STATE KEEP DOLLARS HAVE AUGMENTED THE PROGRAM BUDGET TO SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR BRIDGE HARLEM. TWENTY TWO PROJECTS HAVE EITHER BEEN APPROVED FOR FUNDING OR HAVE DOLLARS SET ASIDE TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION ACROSS THE CITY WHICH EQUATES TO ALMOST TWO THOUSAND BEDS OF INTERIM HOUSING. WE HAVE TO PROJECTS OPEN THUS FAR TOTALING A HUNDRED NINE BEDS FOR THOSE LIVING ON THE STREETS. ABRIDGE HOME IS ANOTHER TESTAMENT TO OUR STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTY AS WE LEVERAGE MEASURE H. FUNDED SERVICES ON AN A BRIDGE HOME SITES. WE APPLAUD THE STATE FOR RESPONDING TO THE CALL FOR ACTION FROM THE BIG CITY MAYORS. TO BECOME A MEANINGFUL PARTNER IN OUR FIGHT TO END HOMELESSNESS AND FOR THE CREATION OF THE HEAT BLOCK GRANT. JUST YESTERDAY COUNCIL ALLOCATED THIRTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR 44% OF THE EIGHTY FIVE MILLION CITY KEEP AWARD WITH AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY NINE MILLION RESERVE FOR PENDING PROJECTS. TAKING THE TOTAL PROGRAMMING IN THE PIPELINE TO UP TO SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OR 80% NEARLY 80% OF THE TOTAL BLOCK GRANT. THIS IS JUST IN MONTHS WITHIN MONTHS OF LA RECEIVING THE HEAT GRANT. THESE NUMBERS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT ARE TALKING TO PEOPLE LIKE JOHN AND MARIE -- LIVE NEAR OUR FIRST A BRIDGE HOME PROJECT ON THE STREETS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THEY HAVE LOST ALL HOPE THAT THEIR LIVES WOULD CHANGE. THEY WERE TO MOVE THERE WERE SOME OF THE FIRST TO MOVE INTO OUR FIRST A BRIDGE HOME PROJECT DUBBED APPOINT DAY WHICH MEANS THE BRIDGE. AND WHO WERE ASSESSED AS BEING HIGHLY VULNERABLE AND PRIORITIZE FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING AT A BUILDING THAT WAS RECENTLY OPENS NEARBY. AND THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE TODAY AND THEIR OWN SAFE WARM THRIVING HOME. AND LA WE WILL PERSIST UNTIL EVERY ANGELINO ON THE STREETS TODAY HAS A SAFE WARM PLACE TO CALL HOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS -- OPEN UP TO OUR COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS I HAVE I'LL KICK IT OFF WITH ONE QUESTION I'VE HAD. IN MY MIND THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AROUND THE POLITICAL CHALLENGES SET LOCALITIES HAVE SO WE'VE HEARD FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY CITY EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE OF HOW MUCH. YOU NEED HELP IN ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND AS YOU'VE HEARD AND AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPEND OR SEND SOME SIGNIFICANT FUNDING BACK DOWN TO JURISDICTIONS. THE CHALLENGE WE SEE IS ON THE FRONT PAGE PAPERS AND I WOULD SAY THAT'S THIS IS TRUE FOR MY CITY FOR LOS ANGELES FORAGE COUNTY. FOR SO MANY JURISDICTIONS OF THE YOU HAVE JURISDICTIONS SAY WE NEED HELP BUT THEN LOCAL OPPOSITION TO THE SHELTER AROUND THE CORNER THE NAVIGATION CENTER THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECT. COMES UP AND I KNOW THIS IS PARTICULARLY INTENSE IN LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY. DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ADDRESSES CHALLENGES ARE HOW HAVE YOU GRAPPLE WITH THIS I KNOW MEREKA CITY HAS TO VERY STRONG AND INSISTING. THAT LA NEED TO DELIVER SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS BUT WE WOULD LOVE SOME GUIDANCE AND HOW WE CAN BE HELPFUL PARTNERS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AS YOU'RE DEALING WITH THESE POLITICAL CHALLENGES. YES THANK YOU IT IS CERTAINLY BEEN A CHALLENGE -- WE HAVE YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED -- BE OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS APPROVED FOR THE HHH BOND AUTHORITY I'M AND THEN WE GO OUT TO COMMUNITIES AND LOOK AT TO CITE THESE PROJECTS AND RUN INTO. ENORMOUS -- COMMUNITY OPPOSITION AND AND I THINK SOME OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY -- GROUNDED AND JUST MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT THE FACE OF HOMELESSNESS IS AND WHO PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE -- AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WHAT WE FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE A LOT OF GRASSROOTS DOOR KNOCKING AT DIALOGUING TALKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADDRESS WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE. AND I CAN'T OVERSEE IT IS IT IS IT INTERESTING BALANCE OF GOING OUT TO COMMUNITIES -- TO ASK FOR THEIR FEET FEEDBACK BUT NOT NECESSARILY -- ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION AND IT IS A DELICATE PLACE TO SAY THERE IS A CRISIS AT THE SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS IS HOUSING. IF NOT HERE THEN WHERE -- I THINK WHAT WHAT IS ALSO BEEN VERY IMPORTANT IS TO POINT OUT THAT -- PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TEND TO STAY IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY ARE NOT A QUOTE UNQUOTE OUTSIDERS PARTICULARLY IN LA THIS IS SOMETHING WE ARE CONSTANTLY GENTLY EDUCATING OUR CONSTITUENTS ON AND THAT THEY REALLY ARE ARE HOMELESS NEIGHBORS -- OUR DATA SHOWS THAT THREE OUT OF pLOS ANGELES HAVE LIVED IN LOS ANGELES FOR TEN YEARS OR LONGER -- IT SO AT THAT JUST SUPPORTS THE ARGUMENT THAT HOUSING NEEDS TO BE BILLS WHERE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- AND AT AS TO ANY DEGREE THAT THE STATE CAN AMPLIFY THAT MESSAGE -- IT REALLY IT REALLY HAS BECOME AN AWARENESS BUILDING CAMPAIGNS AROUND ON DEMYSTIFYING THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS HUMANIZING WHO IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND ALSO TALKING ABOUT. OUT WHAT THE BENEFITS OF PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING CAN BRING TO A NEIGHBORHOOD WE LIKE TO THINK OF PSH AS AN ASSET TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSET IS NOT A BIRD IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE HOUSE TO BEAR SMALL GROUPS. ADD JUST A FACE TO FACE DIALOGUE -- AT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE CAN MAKE THE MOST HAD WAY WITH WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MS QUIRK SILVA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY -- I DO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID ABOUT IN ROLLING THE COMMUNITY INTO WHATEVER TYPE OF PROJECT IS WHETHER IT'S A MARKET RATE. WHETHER IT'S AN AFFORDABLE WHETHER IT'S AN EMERGENCY SHELTER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS YOU KNOW IS NOW WITH SOCIAL MEDIA YOU HAVE NEXT DOOR. AND EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENGAGEMENT ON THESE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AND PEOPLE TRY TO EDUCATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PERMANENT HOUSING AND EMERGENCY SHELTER. THERE ARE SOME THAT JUST ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT THE INFORMATION AND CHARACTERIZE IT AS IN OR BRING IN ALL THE HOMELESS -- ADDICTED PEOPLE TO WHEREVER THE COMMUNITY AS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT LOCAL WHERE MOST OF THESE DECISIONS ARE MADE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CITY COUNCIL-- LEVELS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT WHEN PEOPLE COME OUT TO COUNSEL'S OF IT WHETHER IT'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE COUNCILS OF VEER TOWARDS SAYING NO. AND WHEN THEY SAY NO THESE PROJECTS THEN -- GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND OFTEN CAN TAKE ANOTHER TWO YEARS THREE YEARS -- TO TO MOVE FORWARD WE LOOK AT THE FUNDING COMING IN FROM THE STATE WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TRYING TO DO TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES WERE STUCK. IN MANY WAYS NOT ONLY WITH THE NIMBIS BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT ARE REFUSING TO DO THEIR JOB WHICH IS TO VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD A PROJECT -- AND I KNOW -- THERE'S A LOT STATED ABOUT. LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL COUNCILS NEED TO HAVE THEIR AUTHORITY AND THE STATE. SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT AND COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT MYSELF FOR EIGHT YEARS IT'S ALMOST A NO WIN BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS IF THERE'S SOMETHING. THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT'S POSITIVE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T USUALLY GIVE PRAISE TO THE STATE IF THEY'VE PLAYED A ROLE BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING NEGATIVE THEN THE STATE GETS BLAMED. SO I'M DEFINITELY OF THE THE MOOD THAT WE DO HAVE TO PLAY A A MORE DELIBERATE ROLE. AND IF THE LOCAL ONE GOVERNMENT IS NOT GOING. TO DO THEIR JOB. AND ADDRESS THIS THAN THE STATE AS THE GOVERNOR SAYING SAID IS GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A MORE SERIOUS WAY OF STEPPING END BECAUSE WE CANNOT. CONTINUE TO SAY NO WHEN EVERY EXCUSES RUN OUT MEANING THERE ARE NOW FUNDS COMING IN BECAUSE BEFORE IT WAS THERE WERE NO FUNDS WE CAN'T DO THIS OR WE LOST REDEVELOPMENT. AND ALL OF THESE THINGS AND EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE WELL WE SEE PEOPLE SITTING ON OUR STREETS SO -- I'M GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD -- A PACKAGE OF BILLS AND I'M ASSUMING THEY'LL BE QUITE A BIT OF CRITICISM BUT THE POINT IS WE HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING -- WE ARE NOT CAN BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. I DON'T THINK I HAVE A QUESTION IN THERE I THINK THAT WAS A REALLY BUT THANK YOU. LOOKING FOR WORKING WITH YOU ON THOSE BILLS MISTER GIBSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE ON ALSO WANNA THANK CONVENERS OP POLISH AS WITH BEING A LITTLE TARDY -- I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE THAT'S THAT MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN LOS ANGELES I HAVE SINCE. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND COME VERY ACQUAINTED WITH -- THAT THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS ALWAYS THE FIRST THURSDAY IN THE MONTH OF MARCH MARCH BEING THE COLDEST MONTH OF RECORD IN LOS ANGELES. AND SO I DO THIS AND I DON'T DO WHAT CAMERAS I DO IT WANT TO BE ABLE -- TO UNDERSTAND -- SOME OF THE PLIGHTS THE INDIVIDUALS GO THROUGH. NOT EVER IMAGINING -- MESSAGE YOU'LL MISS RAY AS THAT ONE THAT MY GOD SON -- WOULD BE HOMELESS -- HE'S HOMELESS WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS -- YES I SAID IT AND YOU KNOW -- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS GO THROUGH THE SAME THING THAT OTHER PEOPLE GO THROUGH AND I WANT TO DISPEL THAT MYTH -- WE HAVE PEOPLE IN OUR FAMILY WHO ARE DRUG DEPENDENCE AND AND HOMELESS -- AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN -- IS GENERATIONS. FAMILIES MOTHERS FATHERS WHO ARE ON THE STREETS WHO ARE HOMELESS -- AND YOU KNOW THE OLD ADAGE THAT -- BUILD IT THEY WILL COME NOT IN MY BACKYARD -- AS MY COLLEAGUE -- HAS INDICATED WE HAVE TO TAKE A VERY AGGRESSIVE ROLE IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR ERROR ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE FOUND OUT AND I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE -- A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS WELL AS MYSELF DON'T KNOW. WHAT ORGANIZATIONS ARE FUNDED BY FEDERAL OR STATE OR LOCAL? THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR DISTRICTS. SO WE'RE SCRAMBLING. TO FIND WHAT ORGANIZATION -- TO CONTACT THAT SPECIFICALLY DEAL AND ADDRESS THE PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACED WITH. AND SO FOR ME I'LL BE HAVING A MEETING. WITH ALL MY ELECT ITS -- AND HAVE EVERYONE WHO I THINK WITH THIS LAS -- WHERE THERE'S THE MAYOR'S OFFICE BRINGING EVERYONE TO DO PRESENTATIONS TO US SO WE KNOW WHO'S ONE RECEIVING MONEY? AND MAKE SURE THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE DOING WITH TO DO THAT MONEY AND AS PROVIDING SERVICES TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE GET OFF THE STREETS AND PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SERVICES -- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING IS IS A TREMENDOUS ISSUE -- I KNOW THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES OF MARK WAYS -- COUNCILMAN DAWSON WEBER -- IS TRYING TO DO SOME BUILDING IN IN OUR DISTRICT WE SHARE TOGETHER -- WE'D MISTER GRANT WINDOW PERIOD AND WE WILL BE TRYING AGAIN -- BUT WE NEED SOME ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF GUIDANCE TO TRY TO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN TRY TO DISPEL SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- BECAUSE EVERYONE SEES IT WHEN I GET OFF THE FREEWAY WE'LL GO TO THE GROCERY STORE WE PRETEND THEY DON'T EXIST BUT THEY EXIST. AND YOU KNOW -- IN MAYBE SOMEONE IN OUR FAMILY THAT MAY BE OUT THERE ON THE STREET SO IT'S ALL OF OUR PROBLEMS ALL OF OUR ISSUE. AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT I WOULD ASK AND MY QUESTION IS WHERE DO YOU GUYS DOING TO TRY TO GET THE WORD OUT AND TRY TO DISPEL THE TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES -- THAT COMMUNITY HAVE HOUSE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE SERVICES IS THE COMMUNITY WHOSE BECOMING THE BARRIER. IS THE BECOMING THE ONE WHO'S ALLOWING -- ELECTED TO BE INTIMIDATED EVER TO SPELL AND PULL SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS DOWN SO THAT IT'S EASIER FOR US IN SACRAMENTO TO MAKING SURE THAT. RESOURCES FLOW TO THOSE AREAS WITHOUT HAVING -- TO FEEL INTIMIDATED BECAUSE THERE'S LOCAL JURISDICTION WITH THE CITY COUNCIL OR SUPERVISORS AS SAYING. MY PEOPLE DON'T WANT THIS YEAR. THANK YOU AND I'LL TO SAY WE WE IN LA CERTAINLY WOULD WELCOME THE PARTNERSHIP AND SUPPORT -- OF ANY OF OUR ELECTED SO THANK YOU -- FOR THANK YOU FOR OFFERING THAT. I DON'T THINK WE CAN OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF COORDINATION COLLABORATION AND MY MANTRA IS I DON'T THINK YOU CAN OVER COMMUNICATE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE AND AND WHAT IS OUT THERE -- THINK WE ARE IN A REALLY IMPORTANT MOMENT AND WE ARE LOOKING AT OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION CAMPAIGNS AND AT EVERYONE IN LA A IS -- AT FUNDED BY UNITED WAY LA IT IS A COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND ISSUED OF OUT THAT GOES. TO OUT REACH OUT TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE STANDING ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. EDUCATE PEOPLE -- CREEK VOLUNTEER PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE IF THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY TO GET INVOLVED AND AND A MEANINGFUL WAY -- AS WELL AS HOLD INFORMATION FAIRS AT ONE PROJECT IS GOING TO BE STOOD UP AB TO PROVIDE AGAIN TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO NEIGHBORS -- TO STAKEHOLDERS TO AT PARTNERING ELECTED OFFICIAL OFFICES ADAM AND I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE LA IS SERVE CLEARING HOUSE NOW FOR ON BUILDING COALITIONS TO SUPPORT PROJECTS TO GET OFF THE GROUND -- I WILL SAY I AM I AM THOROUGHLY IMPRESSED WITH AS THE LA THAT. COUNCIL RIGHT NOW OUT FOURTEEN OUT OF FIFTEEN COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE A PROPOSED A BRIDGE HOME PROJECT IN THEIR DISTRICT -- WHICH DOES TAKE A LOT OF POLITICAL COURAGE RIGHT TO GO OUT THERE TO YOUR CONSTITUENCY AND SAY WE NEED TO BILL THAT'S WERE LOOKING TO BUILD THIS HERE -- AND AND I'M COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND I DEFINITELY THINK LOS THE COMING OUT TO DO AT PRESENTATIONS ON WHAT RESOURCES EXIST OUT THERE IS IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SCALED UP SO THREE SIXTY THIS DID TO WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AGAIN I JUST WANTED TO THE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE ALSO HAVE -- A DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS ON THIS PANEL ONE SO IF I CAN I WANTED TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS TO MISS MATH. I SPENT SOMETIME WORKING IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND HANFORD IN MY WIFE'S FAMILY COMES FROM EXETER IN TO LARRY AND SO. I KNOW THE AREA WELL -- IN ONE OF THE STRUGGLES THAT I THINK YOU HIGHLIGHTED THAT. HAS NOT BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE AS TRANSPORTATION. AND THE DIFFICULTIES THAT COME WITH A RURAL COMMUNITY NEEDING TO ACCESS SERVICES AND MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT AND SO. WANTED TO PUT A PRIMARY IN IF I COULD ON A BILL THAT I'LL BE JOIN AUTHORING WITH YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND A BILL THAT WILL HELP PEER TO PEER PROVIDERS IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS TO HELP NAVIGATION. TO HELP DIRECT TOWARD SERVICES AKIN TO WHAT YOU WERE REFERENCING IN YOUR PRESENTATION HERE TODAY. I ALSO -- JOINT ALTERING IT WITH MIGUEL SANTIAGO FROM LOS ANGELES OF HERS A BENEFIT. TO LARGE CITIES AS WELL. BUT SOMETIMES IT'S EVEN IN THE WAY WE CITY MAYORS. I'M NOT SURE HANFORD SMEAR LIKES BEING CALLED THE LITTLE CITY MAYOR. AND YET WE STILL HAVE BIG CITY PROBLEMS AND ADDRESSING ARE HOMELESS CRISIS AS WELL. LAST SUGGESTION IF I CAN IS YOU HAVE A NEW STATE SENATOR SOMEONE WHO I AM QUITE PROUD TO WELCOME TO OUR RANKS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU -- TO PARTNER AND WORK WITH HER AS SHE IS NOW THE CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES ON THE SENATE SIDE. TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF COLLABORATION WE CAN DO TOGETHER -- THOSE OF US IN THE VALLEY HAVE FIGURED OUT A LONG TIME AGO WE HAVE TO HELP LIFT EACH OTHER UP AND I LOOK FORWARD TO FIGURING HOW WE CAN PARTNER TOGETHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS DOCTOR CHOI. OKAY THANK CHAIR -- THANK YOU DEPUTY MAYOR MILLER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. ON LOOKING AT YOUR DATA SHEET. THAT I HAVE HERE. IT IS SO GOOD NEWS THAT -- THE NUMBER OFF OF HOMELESS PEOPLE. INDUSTRY TO FROM -- LITERAL. FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND IT HAS A DECREASE -- TO FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED A SINUS SO -- TWENTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PEOPLE WERE ARE OFF THE STREET TO A WHICH WELL WOODS IS A FROM THE THE GROWTH. THAT I SEE ON THE CHART TO OVER -- TEN THOUSAND HOMELESS PEOPLE GREW FROM 200-016-22000 -- SEVENTEEN SO -- A CURVING THAT THE TREND OF FROM RISING TREND. TO TO A DECREASING TREND -- THAT IN THE CASE SO YOUR AT FOR THE IS -- WORKING. MUCH THE FIFTY TWO THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED UP PEOPLE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. IS ALMOST OUR LACK OF THE AVERAGE. CITY'S POPULATION. ALSO IN ITSELF FOR YOU CAN BE A CITY. DO YOU HAVE ANY UP PLAN WILL PROJECTIONS HOW YOU WANNA. TACKLE I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THE FOR CONSIDERED -- DISTRICTS SO HALF THE PLAN TO BUILD. ONE AND YOU. SOME SOME DISTRICTS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH A LOT OF A STRUGGLE BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION. HAS I KNOW THAT THE I AM VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE KOREATOWN NO SITUATION ON OUR PAPER. IN ALL JACKED IT UP BUT AFTER BECAUSE ABOUT WAS SAW -- DUE TO THE FACT THAT THAT THAT WAS A NOT CONSULTED. NOT ANNOUNCED. AT KNOW PROCESS AND THE LEADERS SECONDARY LOCATION -- WAS A COMPROMISE LOCATION AND THAT THEY ARE HAPPY. IS SO IF THAT TAKES SO LARGO F. FOR THE A TO WORK WITH THE US -- THE RESIDENTS SO OF THE DISK. DISTRICT. BUT THE STILL NOT SO ON THE AUTOBOT O'DONNELL AND TIE IT -- THAT WERE SOLVED A PROBLEM -- IF YOU DATE. THAT YOU WERE -- BRING IT DOWN. THE BILL -- MAKE TEN THOUSAND ONE ONE THOUSAND OR WHATEVER DO YOU HAVE THE SUCH A PLAN. THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION I HAVE FOR SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. YEAH THANK YOU I'M. CERTAINLY HAVE WE KNOW IT IS A VERY LARGE NUMBER EVEN A IN A COUNTY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE. FIFTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND CERTAINLY WE AIM TO GET TO A FUNCTIONAL ZERO WHICH IS THE YOU KNOW THE INFLOW MATCHES THE OUTFLOW IN PEOPLE RESOLVE HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY -- YOU KNOW. YESTERDAY AND THE MAYOR HAS SPECIFICALLY MADE A GOAL AROUND ST HOMELESSNESS SO SPECIFICALLY PEOPLE WERE LIVING. LITERALLY ON THE STREETS THAT WE WOULD AT CUT STREET ALMOST AS IN THE CITY BY HALF I'M IN AND STREET HOMELESSNESS OR GET TO FUNCTIONAL LEVEL FUNCTIONAL ZERO LEVEL. AND IN TEN YEARS AND THIS IS THIS IS NO EASY FEAT -- ONE BECAUSE THREE OUT OF FOUR PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND LA ARE AND SHELTERED THEY'RE LIVING LITERALLY ON THE SIDEWALKS. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS SICK. DESPITE OUTSIDE ON THIS IS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INDOOR PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO INTO ROUND PERMANENT OR OTHERWISE I'M SO REALLY THAT THAT IS THE SOLUTION AND SCALING UP THAT SOLUTION QUICKLY -- IS IS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR RESPONSE AND I'D ALSO SAY THAT WE HAVE -- WE'VE SPENT DECADES -- LETTING THE CRISIS GET TO THIS LEVEL I'M AND IT IS JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT WE HAVE STARTED TO FIND. THE SOLUTIONS THAT ALMOST THE RATE THAT THEY NEED TO BE FUNDED THERE THERE IS STILL A BIT OF A GAP IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING AND THAT IS WHERE HE DOLLARS HAVE BECOME. AN INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL ESPECIALLY -- IN THERE AND EXPEDITIOUS MANNER OF GETTING TO THE CITY -- AS WELL AS THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND BUT WE HAVE JUST STARTED TO DO THE WORK THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG. I'M AND THIS IS AGAIN I THINK SOME DECIDED I THINK OTHERS HAVE SAID IT WE NEED TO FIND A SYSTEM THAT CREATES SYSTEM FLOW. INPUT AND OUTPUT QUICKLY -- IF WE WERE TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE PIECE OF THE SYSTEM I. E. SHELTERS OR INTERIM SOLUTIONS WE WOULDN'T GET THE OUT FLOW THAT WE NEED A TO PERMANENTLY AND SOMEONE'S HOMELESSNESS. AND IF WE'RE NOT CREATING ENOUGH AT PATHWAYS INTO THE SYSTEM -- I EAT OUTREACH WORKERS GOING FIGURATIVELY WHERE THEY ARE -- WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FIND OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE AND TRIAGE THEM TO THE HOUSING OF BEST FITS YOUR ROUGHLY SAYING THAT IT'LL TAKE TEN YEARS TO KHATAMI TOP HALF IS THE DUST YOUR GENERAL GOLD. THAT ISN'T COOL YEAH OKAYWHAT WHAT WHAT IS -- YOU WERE BIGGEST A NUMBER ONE TWO ONE THREE ARE THE ISSUES THAT YOU CANNOT TO SPEED UP. THE PROCESS OF THE TEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME IN ALL THOSE STREETS THAT THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT. MAN IS SO WHAT THE THE BILL TWENTY SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL BE STILL ON THE STREET THAT THAT'S A LONG TIME FOR TEN YEARS I HAVE TO PUT UP OF WHEN I PULL LÃ . IT IS NOT FOR THOSE PEOPLE TO SUFFER. SOLA -- CAN YOU NAME WHO. HOW WHAT IMPEDIMENT SORRY WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE WHY YOU CANNOT? SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. ON THE MORE RAPID. YEAH I MEAN I I DO THINK AT AS WE TALKED ABOUT CITING AS AN ISSUE FINDING PLACES TO PUT -- INTERIM PERMANENT HOUSING -- IS IS A CHALLENGE -- SO IT DOES TAKE A LOT OF COMMUNITY CONVERSATIONS IS AS YOU REFERENCED KOREATOWN IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE AB THE COMMUNITY WAS. NOT HAPPY WITH THE LOCATION OF THE SITE I'M AND YOU KNOW I'M DOING MORE. THOUGHT FULL DEEPER ENGAGEMENT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IF NOT HERE THEN WHERE AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE WE ARE AT NOW AT WE HAVE TO GET TO YES. WE HAVE -- TO SO IF IF YOU'RE IF A COMMUNITY IS SAYING WE HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE SITE AND THEN PARTNER WITH US AND HELP US FIND AN ALTERNATIVE SITE. AND BECAUSE WE WE CAN'T CONTINUE THE COURSE OR THE TRAJECTORY THAT WERE ON AND SO AT AT I DON'T THINK IT'S AND WE FOCUS A LOT ON AND OPPOSITION IN PEOPLE WHO SAY NO. AND I WILL SAY UNITED WAY DID A STUDY -- LAST YEAR AND ASKED THE QUESTION TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS -- IT WOULD YOU. WOULD YOU BE SUPPORTIVE OF A SUPPORT OF HOUSING PROJECT BUILT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD NOT JUST YOUR TOWN AND NOT JUST YOUR COMMUNITY BUT IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THEY FOUND THAT 70% OF THE PEOPLE ANSWERED THAT QUESTION THAT THEY WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE -- AND THAT IS THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT ONCE YOU'RE YOU YOU YOU YOU ARE FIRST OF A PROBLEM AS AS IT SEEMS TO SOUND A AS A FOR YOU HAVE A IN A IN A FUNDING. BUT THE RESIDENTS THE OPPOSITION IS THAT THE HOLDER. FIGHTING IS A CHALLENGE I I ALSO JUST LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE DOING WE'RE DESIGNING A HOMELESS AND HOUSING SERVICE SYSTEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AS THE AS THE UMBRELLA ENVIRONMENT ON EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING FOR SAYING CITING PSH EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS WITH AN ENVIRONMENT OF AT A VERY SIGNIFICANT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE. CITY WIDE COUNTY WIDE AND STATEWIDE -- SO. I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW DIFFERENT ASPECTS HERE WE TO HELP KEEP KEEPING KEEP PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS AT NINETY THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES FOR HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. LAST YEAR THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER EVER AND SO WE'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THAT AND FIGURE OUT WAYS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE -- SO CITING STANDING UP PROJECTS DOING THIS ENVIRONMENT OF A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'M KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSE TO OUR HOUSE PRECARIOUSLY OR OR UNSTABLE HOUSED AND SO PREVENTING THE INFLOW AND SPENDING THE INFLOWS ALSO. A KEY CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON AS WELL. CHIU STORY AND I HAVE A TOO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IT'S AS OUR ARE A TRY TO ASK WHETHER THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOCAL DECISION ON WAS STATE LEVEL -- ONE OF THE PROFESSORS SO WHO LIVED IN NOT ON CHINA FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT HE HAD THE SOME. YOU KNOW OF CONTACTS WITH THE BUSINESS PEOPLE AND THE LEARNING OF THE ISSUES A HOMELESSNESS -- SITUATION IN AMERICA AND JUST -- YOU KNOW CRISIS SITUATION. AND NOT HE WAS CONTACTED AND THAT IN RETURN IN A AND THE SINCE THEN WHAT KIND OF TALK HAS BEEN. THE IN ALL HAD ONE DEVELOPED INTO ON THE SHOW BUT THE BASIC IDEA WAS THAT THE A PRIVATE COMPANY IT WOULD BE PUBLIC PRIVATE THOUGH -- A JOINT. COLLABORATION TO ATTACK THIS POP UP. AND IT. IN A HARD TO BELIEVE I WAS AT THE 70% OF THE COST OF THE GOVERNMENT THE SPENDING. AND THE STEEL THEY CAN. WIPE OUT THE ENTIRE HOMELESS IN THIS OF A SITUATION AND PROVIDE THE OR THE HOUSING THAT. THEIR HEALTH ISSUES EDUCATION IS AND JOB TRAINING EVERYTHING. IS THERE ANY -- REASON -- WHY NOT THE WIFE YOU ARE WILLING TO COLLABORATE DOUBLE WOULD SEE -- SUCH OF A PRIVATE ENTITIES. AND THEY LEFT THEM -- SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOU KEEP FOR YOU AUTHORIZED SAID THEY ARE -- WORKING WITH YOU ON THE ISSUE WITH A DAISY PRESENTED TO US THAT THE DAY WATER -- HAVE TO BE HELP PERMITTED UP BY YOU JOINING WITH THE HOUSING CAN BE DEVELOPED AND THEN AGAIN WITH THE COMMUNITY INVOLVED MONTH ATTACK. THAT THE SITE. IN ENTIRE DISTRICT A DISTRICT BY DISTRICT A IF YOU GO THROUGH THE PROPER. OF PROCESS SO CONTACT WITH THE BUSINESS PERSON. IN ALL ASSOCIATING THAT UP ARE OF CHINESE BASSOON MEN CAN SOLVE THEM AMERICAN PROBLEM NO BUT THE IF YOU ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM -- AND THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT THE EVIDENCE. THANK YOU YES WE WE WELCOME THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE BUSINESS SECTOR [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU I JUST HAVE TO HEARING THAT DISCUSSION I THINK. IN OUR UNDERSTANDING IN CHINA IT IS POSSIBLE TO BUILD A LOT FASTER BUT THERE IS NOT. THE SAME DEMOCRATIC LOCAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ALLOW FOR LOCAL CONTROL WHICH I KNOW IS VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU. AND MANY OTHERS IN IN THAT AND I THINK THAT IS A FACTOR AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUILDING HOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO -- WHO ALMOST BY DEFINITION DON'T HAVE THE INCOME? TO FORT MARKET RATE OR OTHER TYPES OF OF HOUSING SO THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WORK IF YOU HAVE THOSE AND CONSTRAINTS AND THAT'S WHY. IT'S BEEN SO IMPORTANT FOR THE STATE IN RECENT YEARS TO INVEST IN WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES -- IN THE DOLLARS THAT WE NEED -- FOR AT LEAST PUBLIC PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS IF THERE ARE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ARE OUT THERE -- I'VE NOT. KNOWN AS APPROACH ME THIS THE SHELTERS THE NAVIGATION CENTERS AND THE SUPPORT HOUSING THAT WE NEED TO MOVE THIS FORWARD BUT THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION -- ONE THANK THE PANELISTS FOR YOUR GREAT FEEDBACK AND A LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED WORKED. AND I WANNA CALL UP THE FINAL PANEL. WE'VE ASKED A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS TO HELP US IDENTIFY AND HIGHLIGHT GAPS IN THE RESPONSE OF VERY STRESSED ACTIONS LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS -- LIKE DIVIDE UP FROM THE CONRAD HILTON FOUNDATION BILL. CAN FROM CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING SHARE REPORT. FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA CHRIS MARTIN AND FROM THE CALIFORNIA WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. FRANK MECCA [inaudible] AND ONCE YOU FIND YOUR NAME CARDS IF YOU COULD PROCEED IN THE ORDER IN WHICH WE LISTED YOU IN OUR HEARING AGENDA. STARTING WITH MISTER PICK. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO ASK US TO SPEAK TODAY. OTHER CORPORATION FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITH A FOCUS ON SOLVING HOMELESSNESS -- AS YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IN ALMOST EVERY MAJOR CATEGORY HAD REPORTS DATA CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE NATION IN THE NUMBER AND VULNERABILITY OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. MY HOPE IS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN BECOME A LEADER IN TURNING AROUND THIS MORAL CRISIS. TO DO SO WE SHOULD FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS SOLVABLE WITH HOUSING WITHOUT LIMITS ON LENGTH OF STAY ARE PERMANENT HOUSING. AND WAS SERVICES TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO HOUSING AND KEEP THEM STABLY HOUSE. LEADERSHIP CEMEX DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE NEEDS -- THAT WE HAVE DATA ABOUT HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T RELY ON THESE DATA WHEN INVESTING. WE FAIL TO PRIORITIZE OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PATTERNS OF HOMELESSNESS YOUTH SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AND CHILD WELFARE INVOLVE FAMILIES PEOPLE ON PAROLE AN OLDER ADULTS EVEN THOUGH DATA SHOWS MANY AMONG THESE POPULATIONS ARE COSTLY. AS ONE EXAMPLE WE HAVE 35% OF THE NATION'S CHRONICALLY HOMELESS POPULATIONS -- BUT WE HAVE ONE ONLY ONE SMALL PROGRAM CREATED THROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSE AB SEVENTY FOUR THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE FAR FEWER RESOURCES FOR YOUTH. DEDICATED AND TARGETED RESOURCES HAVE WORK TO REDUCE VETERANS AND FAMILY HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA AND PROGRAM SHOULD PRIORITIZE THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING THEIR NUMBERS. WE SHOULD ALSO ASSESS THE AVAILABILITY OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING RAPID RE HOUSING -- VOUCHERS AND SHELTER BEDS AND QUICK HOW QUICKLY THESE RESOURCES TURNOVER AND WHERE PEOPLE GO WHEN THEY LEAVE. WITH THESE DATA WE WOULD HAVE MUCH ROOM I HAVE BETTER -- ACCURATE PICTURE OF THE GAPS. CALIFORNIA IS NOW LEADING IN CAPITAL FUNDING TO CREATE SUPPORT OF HOUSING. BETWEEN PROPOSITIONS ONE INTO AND WITH THE HOPE OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL FOR DEVELOPERS -- CAPACITY. CAPITAL IS NOT HOWEVER THE ONLY TYPE OF FUNDING NEEDED TO CREATE MORE SUPPORT HOUSING. BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY ENOUGH RENT FOR DEVELOPER TO OPERATE A BUILDING WE ALSO NEED TO PAY FOR OPERATING COSTS FOR UTILITIES MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS. DEVELOPERS HAVE TYPICALLY RELIED ON HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS ARE SECTION EIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT WE WON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH OF THOSE RESOURCES. TO OPERATE BUILDING STATE PROGRAMS -- ARE BEING ARE GOING TO BE CREATING. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC OR FREQUENT HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO NEED FUNDING FOR SERVICES FOR SUPPORT OF HOUSING TENANTS JERMAINE STATELY HOUSE. MEDI CAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT PROVIDE FUNDING BUT THESE PROGRAMS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO OFFER THE INTENT SERVICES SUPPORT OF HOUSING TENANTS NEED. WE ALSO CANNOT HOPE TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS BY BUILDING ALONE IT TAKES YEARS AND SOME COMMUNITIES LACK THE DEVELOPER CAPACITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CAPITAL FUNDING. SO I WOULD SAY OUR BIGGEST GAP IS INCOME FUNDING RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO GET OF PEOPLE HOUSED WITH PRIVATE MARKET LANDLORDS ALONG WITH PASSING NEW LAWS PROHIBITING SOURCE OF INCOME DISCRIMINATION. LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- THE FRESNO HOUSING AUTHORITY AND THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE ALL USE RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO MOVE THOUSANDS FROM STREETS TO HOMES. CREATING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS ALSO CRITICAL TO SOLVING HOMELESSNESS AS MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DON'T NEED SUPPORT OF HOUSING THEY SIMPLY NEED AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE TAX OF HOMELESSNESS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST HOMELESS PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIZES. EVEN FOR HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH INCOMES THAT 30% OF AN AREAS MEDIAN INCOME CANNOT AFFORD THAT HOUSING. CALIFORNIA COULD REQUIRE ARE PROJECTS RECEIVING STATE FUNDING TO INCLUDE A PERCENTAGE OR NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WOULD TARGET SPECIFICALLY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR SET ASIDE THOSE UNITS. WE COULD -- TIE FUNDING FOR RAPID RE HOUSING TO THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS TO HELP THOSE HOUSEHOLDS PAY RENT. THE STATE COULD ALSO PROVIDE -- OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS FOR THIS PURPOSE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO LEAD IN CHANGING SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESSNESS -- SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESSNESS AND BEAR THE BIGGEST COSTS CRIMINAL JUSTICE CHILD WELFARE AND OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. SHOULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLUTION FOR WAYS. THERE ARE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS MADE STRIDES IN FUNDING SERVICES TO HELP PEOPLE OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN HOUSING. ARE MEDI CAL SYSTEM HAS A LONG WAY TO GO AND MAKING ACCESS TO SERVICES SEAMLESS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND IN OF INTEGRATING THOSE SERVICES WITH THE HOUSING. OUR PRO PRAGUE PROGRAMS TEND TO ADD BARRIERS RATHER THAN REMOVE THEM AND GETTING PEOPLE -- WERE ON PAROLE HOUSE EVEN THOUGH FOR ALL THESE ARE BOTH MUCH MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY EXIT PRISM AND MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE SET OF EIGHT WHEN THEY'RE HOMELESS. THESE FOCUS SHOULD -- THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE REFORM TO ADOPT HOUSING FIRST APPROACHES. CALIFORNIA CAN ALSO LEAD AND RESPONSE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR SHELTER FUNDING. A SHELTER ONLY STRATEGY WON'T SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN FACT PEOPLE ARE STILL CONSIDERED HOMELESS WHEN IN SHELTERS AND SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS NEVER ACCESS SHELTERS. IS SHELL TO RESIDENTS CANNOT ACCESS EXIT TO PERMANENT HOUSING AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL. THEY WILL CERTAINLY CYCLE BACK TO THE STREETS AND FOR THIS REASON WHILE WE DO AGREE THAT THE STATE SHOULD ALLOW -- FOR AND FUNDING FOR INTERMENT OF ENGINES LIKE SHELTERS MOTEL BOUNCERS NAVIGATION CENTERS AND RESPITE CARE. THIS FUNDING SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY SERVICES AND HOUSING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE VIABLE FOR PATHWAYS TO PERMANENT HOUSING. FINALLY INTERIM INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE LOW BARRIER I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH -- WETNESS NICHE AND JOB MENTIONED EARLIER -- TO SUM UP THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S TAKEN STRIDES TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS WE NEED LEADERSHIP. ON A NUMBER OF WAYS. FIRST -- CHANGE THE DIALOGUE FROM WHAT WE CAN GETS WHAT'S NEEDED TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS AND THIS REQUIRES A NEEDS ANALYSIS. INVESTMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON FILLING GAPS IN GETTING PEOPLE PERMANENTLY HOUSE LIKE FUNDING FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE OPERATING AND SERVICES. WE SHOULD FIND WAYS TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. WE SHOULD CREATE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN STATE SYSTEMS AND OUR LOCAL HOMELESS SYSTEM AND FOSTER A FOSTER COLLABORATION LOCALLY. FINALLY WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON ALLOWING PEOPLE TO ESCAPE THE STREETS PERMANENTLY. INPUT PARAMETERS AROUND TEMPORARY INTERVENTIONS THAT KEEP PEOPLE HOMELESS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO BE HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S GO TO THE NEXT BAKER. CAN OF CAR HELD FOUNDATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING -- THE INVITATION TO SPEAK HERE THIS JOINT HEARING. I AM DIRECTOR DOMESTIC PROGRAMS AT THE CONRAD ON HELP FOUNDATION WE'RE GLOBAL FOUNDATION HEADQUARTERED IN LOS ANGELES FOUND IN NINETEEN FORTY FOUR BY CONRAD HILTON WHO STARTED THE HILTON HOTELS -- AMONG OUR DOMESTIC PROGRAMS ARE HOMELESSNESS A BIG AREA OF FOCUS OF OURS BUT ALSO WE HAVE INITIATIVE ON TRANSITIONS FOSTER YOUTH YOUTH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND SERVICES PREVENTION. ONE OF THE LONGEST STANDING -- PHILANTHROPIC AND LARGEST PHILANTHROPIC FUNDERS ON HOMELESSNESS ALL TOGETHER WITH INVESTED HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE US. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM LOS ANGELES. I ALSO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF THE FUNDERS TOGETHER TO END HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS A NATIONAL NETWORK OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PHILANTHROPIC FUNDERS WORKING ON HOMELESSNESS. TOGETHER THE MEMBERS CONTRIBUTE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TOWARDS ENDING PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY MEMBERS FIFTY SIX ARE IN CALIFORNIA. SIMPLY PUT WE BELIEVE THAT PHILANTHROPY HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN EFFORTS TO END AND PREVENT HOMELESSNESS. BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T DO IT ALONE OUT. THERE WAS A COMMENT EARLIER ABOUT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS ALL SPEAK TO SOME OF THOSE AND AS SPEAKING FROM PHILANTHROPY BUT GOVERNMENT IS A KEY PARTNER FOR US. ALL ALONG WITH ARE NOT COMMITTEE NONPROFIT PARTNERS. WHO WORKED TIRELESSLY TO HELP OUR NEIGHBORS WHO SEVEN ASKED TO SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM PHILANTHROPY AND AND OUR FOUNDATION ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND? TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF ORGANIZED ABOUT THREE LESSONS WHICH YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THAT I THINK ARE. ARE ARE BEAR REPEATING FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WE KNOW -- HAS HAS BEEN REFERENCED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY THAT THE SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IS HOUSING. DATING EXPERIENCE SHOW THAT HOUSING FIRST APPROACH SUPPORT OF HOUSING. OR RAPID RE HOUSING MUST BE THE SET AT THE CENTER OF ANY COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TENDING HOMELESSNESS -- EMERGENCY SHELTER NEEDS TO BE PART AS PART OF A CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM TO MAKE HOMELESSNESS RARE BRIEF AND NON RECURRING. BUT IN ITSELF IT'S NOT A SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN ROUGH AS HAS BEEN REFERENCED EARLIER. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT SUPPORTS TO HELP ME PEOPLE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE HOMELESSNESS BUT IN AND OF THEMSELVES ARE NOT COMPLETE SOLUTIONS. EITHER. ONLY PROVIDING ACCESS TO PERMIT HOUSING WITH NECESSARY SUPPORTS CAN TRULY AND HOMELESSNESS. OUR GRANTEES FIND THAT OVER WELL OVER 90% OF PEOPLE WHO WERE PLACED IN A PERMITS PART OF HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE REMAIN HOUSE A YEAR OR MORE. LATER SUPPORT SUPPORT OF HOUSING WORKS. WE FIND ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE BOTH SINGLE SITE HOUSING MEANING DEVELOPMENTS AND OFTEN NEW DEVELOPMENTS. ARE VERY NICE DEVELOPMENTS OF OF HOUSING AND ALSO SCATTERED SAID. SO EXCEPT EXISTING HOUSING IS A RENTAL SUBSIDIES WE OFTEN GET ASKED WHICH IS BETTER A SINGLE SITE TO BE BUILDING NEW HOUSING SHOULD WE BE USING THE EXISTING HOUSING MARKET. THE ANSWER IS YES WE NEED BOTH -- AND WE NEED MORE. AS PEOPLE COME WITH VARIOUS NEEDS -- AND COMMUNITIES COME WITH VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS WHICH WE'VE HEARD. BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS WE NEED MORE HOUSING. AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HOMELESS STE OIL. AND THRIVE. A SECOND LESSON WE LEARNED IS THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A CROSS SECTOR PROBLEM. AND IT THEREFORE REQUIRES CROSS SECTOR SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS ARE MANY JOB LOSS EVICTIONS HEALTH CRISES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCARCERATION. CHILL WHAT WELL FOR INVOLVEMENT. THE SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO HOMELESS TO AND BEAR THE BRUNT OF HOMELESSNESS MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. YOU'RE JOINT HEARING TODAY AS EVIDENCE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THIS. HOW SYSTEMS OUR HOSPITALS ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZING THAT HOUSING IS HEALTHCARE? YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE KAISER PERMANENTE FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY MADE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MANY OTHER HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL TO MAKE AN SIMILAR EFFORTS INVESTING IN HOUSING AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. LIKEWISE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY SEEING AND RECOGNIZING THAT AND IMPACT IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BREAKING THE STREETS TO JAIL CYCLE IS A STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME WHEN PEOPLE RE ENTERING THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO GO BACK TO JAIL PRISON. ONE SUCCESSFUL EFFORT WE'VE BEEN A PART OF IN THESE FRANCIS LA'S FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL AS A FACT SHEET IN YOUR MATERIALS. THE FOUNDATION HELP SEE THIS POOL WITH FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. THE POOL HAS BECOME A CENTERPIECE OF THE COUNTIES EFFORTS TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR LET IT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERY YEAR. IT STARTED WITH IT PART OF HEALTH SERVICES BUT HAS GROWN INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH AND PROBATION DEPARTMENT AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE COUNTY. AS IT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER THE THE REPORT AND EVALUATION BY THE RAND CORPORATION. FOUNDER THAT THE FLEX OF HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL PRODUCED A NET SAVINGS OF ABOUT 20%. FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR INVESTED THE PROGRAM THE COUNTY STATE ONE DOLLAR TWENTY CENTS BY REDUCING HEALTH THE SERVICE COSTS SO NOW NOT ONLY SUPPORT OF HOUSING. EFFECTIVE HELPING PEOPLE STABILIZER BECOME HEALTHY IT IS COST EFFECTIVE. THE THIRD AND FINAL LESSON NOW HOW TO HIGHLIGHT AND IT'S BEEN REFERENCED ALREADY IS COLLABORATION IS KEY. TEN YEARS AGO WHEN FOUNDATION STARTED THIS CURRENT MISSION OF ON HOMELESSNESS WE TALKED WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LEADERSHIP. AND LOS ANGELES WAS SEEN AS IT IT NICELY AND I COURTED ORDEN COORDINATED MASS AND HOW IT ADDRESSED HOMELESSNESS NOT VERY MUCH COORDINATION. TODAY WE STILL HAVE BIG CHALLENGES AS WE'VE DISCUSSED BUT WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE STRONG PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS THAT SHARE SIMILAR VALUES. AND A CO INVESTING IN THE SAME STRATEGIES AND GOALS. ONE IMPORTANT FACTOR GRAY THIS APARTMENT IS HOME FOR GOOD EFFORT WHICH CRISTINA MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY THIS IS A TABLE WHERE -- UNITED WAY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HELP CREATE A PLACE WHERE BUSINESS LEADERS PHILANTHROPY. ELECTED OFFICIALS -- PUBLIC OFFICIALS HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMITTEES OR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO COME TOGETHER. TO WORK TOWARD A COMMON GOAL OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE A FUNDERS COLLABORATIVE MANAGED BY UNITED WAY WHERE PHILANTHROPIC AND PUBLIC SECTOR FUNDERS. COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE FUNDING AN ANNUAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND THERE'S A FACT SHEET IN YOUR BUT YOURS AS WELL. OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS THE PUNDITS COLLABORATIVE HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PHILANTHROPIC FUNDS. WITH A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND CITY AND COUNTY RESOURCE. THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS IMPORTANT BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE COORDINATED AND WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER AND MAKING DECISIONS TOGETHER WORKING TOWARDS THE SAME GOAL. WITH THE AMOUNT OF NEW CITY AND COUNTY FUNDING THAT'S BEEN REFERENCED -- ALMOST FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE'RE SEEING A GOOD PROBLEM ORGANIZATIONS ARE. I HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BUT SOMETIMES THEY'RE OVERWHELMED. AND SO THE FUNDERS COLLABORATIVE HAS BEEN FOCUSING HELPING THE BILL THE CAPACITY OF OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS WHOSE BUDGETS HAVE LITERALLY TRIPLED. THEY'VE HAD A TRIPLE THE SIZE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES -- IN THEIR BUDGETS SO ARE ARE PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC DOLLARS ARE HELPING BUILD THEIR CAPACITY. TO TAKE ON THOSE RESOURCES SO THEY CAN GET THE MONEY OUT AND HELP MORE IMPORTANTLY HOUSE MORE PEOPLE. I AND THEN I DID WANT TO MENTION THERE IS ANOTHER QUESTION I CAN BE OPPOSITION AND AND CRISTINA ALREADY REFERENCED EVERYONE IN. WHICH IS A CAMPAIGN THAT PHILANTHROPY SUPPORTS THROUGH UNITED WAY BRED A LOS ANGELES YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK IT OUT. EVERYONE IN LA DOT ORG IS A GREAT COMMUNITY EFFORT THAT INCLUDES COMMUNITY EVENTS CAMINO ORGANIZING TO BUILD SUPPORT FOR THE SOLUTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO GET AHEAD OF THEM SO WE'RE NOT PLAYING DEFENSE ALL THE TIME AND WE ARE. WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS EFFORT. RECENT START SAY POLICIES PROPOSITIONS AND LEGISLATION ARE VITAL TO OUR COLLECTIVE EFFORTS ON HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA WE MUCH TO BUILD ON FLANNERY'S PLACE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT INVESTING PERMITS SOLUTIONS. TO ONE OF THE GREAT MORAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY THANK YOU [inaudible] GOOD. MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU TO THE CHAIRS FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS -- THE CRITICAL HUMANITARIAN ISSUE FOR OUR STATE AS WELL AS A CRITICAL MORAL ISSUE AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED EARLIER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRISIS. MY NAME IS CHRISTOPHER MARTIN I'M A LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON HOMELESSNESS FOR HOUSING CALIFORNIA I AM -- ONE OF ONLY TWO FULL TIME STATE ADVOCATES WHO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON ENDING HOMELESSNESS FOR ALL POPULATIONS. IN CALIFORNIA THE OTHER BEING SHARON REPORT RIGHT HERE. FOR HOUSING CALIFORNIA IS A NONPROFIT ADVOCACY OR ORGANIZATION WITH THE MISSION TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IS HOMELESS AND EVERYONE HAS A SAFE STABLE AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE FOR ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED MANY TIMES TODAY THE MOST IN THE NATION. OF THOSE. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND ARE ADULTS WITH NO ACCOMPANYING FAMILY NO CHRONIC CONDITION AND OFTEN NO EFFECTIVE PROGRAM TO HELP THEM FIND A PERMANENT HOME. ARE SINGLE INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS NEIGHBORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABOUT TWICE THE NATIONAL RATE. FOR IS A LARGE NUMBER BUT THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE NUMBER. AND I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT AN INNOVATIVE EVIDENCE BASE SOLUTION TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND OTHER SIR UNDERSERVED CALIFORNIANS. AND IT'S BEEN REFERENCED A COUPLE TIMES ALREADY -- IT'S CALLED THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY. FOR FOR I PRESENT THIS STATEWIDE SOLUTION AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS OF RESEARCH AND COLLECTION OF BEST PRACTICES AND NEEDS. THIS PAST FALL HOUSING CALIFORNIA MET WITH LEADER IT'S NICE IN FIVE DIFFERENT REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO. SACRAMENTO FRESNO LOS ANGELES AND SAN DIEGO. AT EACH OF THESE CONVENIENCE WE DISCUSS LOCAL BARRIERS TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND HOW THE STATE COULD ASSIST IN EFFORTS FOR ONE OF THE MOST COMMON RESPONSES WAS THAT OUR STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS COULD BE MORE COORDINATED AND EFFECTIVE. IN FACT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA FUNDED EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AT SIX DIFFERENT STATE DEPARTMENTS. EACH WITH DIFFERENT GOALS AND POPULATION TARGETS FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESS SERVICES. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LESS FILL MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS REQUIRING DIFFERENT CRITERIA THEY HAVE DIFFERENT DEADLINES WITH NO CROSS AGENCY OR CROSS DEPARTMENTAL COLLABORATION. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ALSO NOT USING EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES. THE STATE COULD COMBINE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVEN TO DECREASE HOMELESSNESS INTO ONE STATEWIDE FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL. THIS RECOMMENDED SOLUTION BILLS OFF THE SUCCESSES THAT HAVE BEEN TALKED ABOUT TODAY OF PLACES THAT HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED A FLEXIBLE LIKE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AS BILL DISCUSS. FOR THIS FLEXIBLE COULD CONSOLIDATE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INTO A QUOTE ON QUOTE ONE STOP SHOP. FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND NON PROFITS TO ACCESS VIA ONE STREAMLINED APPLICATION. THE FLEXIBLE WOULD ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THE FOLLOWING. I WOULD IMPLEMENT THE EVIDENCE BASED MODEL OF HOUSING FIRST STATEWIDE. IT COULD PULL TOGETHER PRIVATE LOCAL AND STATE INVESTMENT. AND FACILITATE COLLABORATION AMONG LOCAL -- MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES AND ACROSS JURISDICTIONS FOR THIS FUNDING POOL IS INTENDED TO BE FLEXIBLE IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD PROVIDING GRANTS FOR ENDING HOMELESSNESS THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE. OPERATING SUBSIDIES SERVICES SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS AND TEMPORARY RELIEF. FOR EXAMPLE IN ADDITION TO RENT SUBSIDIES THE LA FLEXIBLE FUNDS A RANGE OF CLIENT ASSISTANCE. LIKE MOVING COSTS FURNITURE PURITY DEPOSITS AND LANDLORD INCENTIVES LIKE SIGNING BONUSES AND VACANT UNIT UNIT HOLDS FOR THESE ARE JUST AS ESSENTIAL AS THE RENT SUBSIDY ITSELF. TO KELP CALIFORNIANS FIND AND KEEP HOMES. AN EFFECTIVE FLEXIBLE WITH THESE SERVICES REQUIRES A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND LOCAL COORDINATION TO THINGS THAT ARE GOVERNOR OUTLINED IN HIS BUDGET AS GOALS TO HELP AND HOMELESSNESS. SUCH PARTNERSHIPS AND COORDINATION ARE CRUCIAL IF WE ARE TO TRULY MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING SINGLE ADULTS FAMILIES CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS PEOPLE EXITING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AN OLDER ADULTS. THOUGH THERE ARE OVER FOUR THOUSAND SUCCESSFUL STORIES THANKS TO THE LOS ANGELES FLEXIBLE AND LIKE TO SHARE. ONE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN LA RESIDENT. EUGENE LAWSON WAS REFERRED TO THE FLEXIBLE FUNDED PROGRAM TO A FLEXIBLE FUNDED OUR PROGRAM RUN BY SERVICE PROVIDER BILLION CORNERS. CALLED BREAKING BARRIERS. EUGENE A BEEN A LONG LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE CULINARY STUDENT TRYING TO OVERCOME AN ADDICTION HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORTS NECESSARY AND ENDED UP LOSING HIS APARTMENT. THROUGH A CASE MANAGER EUGENE WAS ENROLLED IN BREAKING BARRIERS AND WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF BEING STABLY HOUSE WITH THE PROGRAM EUGENE FELL BACK INTO ADDICTION. THIS TIME HOWEVER. HIS EXPERIENCE WAS DIFFERENT. AS A PARTICIPANT OF BREAKING BARRIERS HOUSING FIRST PROGRAM WAS SERVICES. EUGENE HAD THE SUPPORT AND HOUSING STABILITY HE HAD LACKED IN THE PAST. IN A MOMENT OF HOPELESSNESS EUGENE CALL HIS BREAKING SUPPORT. HE WAS IMMEDIATELY ADMITTED TO A REHAB PROGRAM WHILE BEING ABLE TO KEEP HIS APARTMENT. AT THE COMPLETION OF THIS PROGRAM EUGENE STILL HAD A PLACE TO CALL HOME A SAFE PLACE WHERE HE COULD FOCUS ON HIS HEALING AND SCHOOLING. FOR TODAY EUGENE IS THE HEAD CHEF AT KAVA A SUCCESSFUL MEDITERRANEAN RESTAURANT IN LOS ANGELES. HERE'S A QUOTE FROM EUGENE. IF I DIDN'T HAVE A STABLE LIVING SAGE SITUATION I PROBABLY WOULD ENDED UP BACK ON DRUGS AND IN JAIL AGAIN. EUGENE IS ONE OF OVER FOUR THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONG. SINCE THE START OF THEIR FLEXIBLE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN THIS NUMBER EXCEEDS THE COUNTIES AMBITIOUS GOAL OF HOUSING TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED IN ITS FIRST FOUR YEARS AND ARE AVERAGING TWO HUNDRED NEW UNITS SECURED PER MONTH. FOR IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES FOR OUR CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORS LIVING ON THE STREETS OR IN CARS IN TEMPORARY SHELTERS TODAY WHO COULD BE SERVED IF THE STATE HELP THE SCALE THIS PROGRAM UP. THE NET COST SAVINGS AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED A FEW TIMES TODAY ACCORDING TO A RAND STUDY OF THE LOS ANGELES PROGRAM. IS 20% IT'S NOT JUST HEARING CRISIS BUT IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC PRIVATE EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT. WE ALL KNOW THIS THE ONLY SOLUTION TO AND HOMELESSNESS IS A HOME. THE STATE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO END HOMELESSNESS FOR THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN IT IS NOW WITH A FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL. AND I AM EXCITED TODAY TO ANNOUNCE. THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK SILVA WILL BE AUTHORING LEGISLATION TO CREATE THIS FLEXIBLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL PROGRAM FOR THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE HOPE THAT YOU ALL WILL SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION WHEN IT IS HEARD IN THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER MARTIN. MR MECCA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR I AM FRANK MAC OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I'M PARTICULARLY GRATIFIED. TO BE HERE BECAUSE TO MY RECOLLECTION THIS IS THE FIRST SUCH JOINT HEARING. AT LEAST IN MY TWENTY EIGHT YEARS AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A CB DA. AND I THINK THAT JUST RECOGNIZES YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF OUR SORT OF MAIN POINT HERE TODAY AND THAT IS. THE INTERSECTION IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HOMELESSNESS SYSTEMS HOUSING SYSTEMS AND HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL FOR THE SUCCESS OF ALL. AND WHAT. MY MEMBERS THE HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTORS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE INCREASINGLY EXPERIENCED. IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO. ON IS AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR POPULATIONS WHICH IS UNDERMINING OUR SUCCESS. TO GET THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU WANT TO THE HUMAN SERVICES SYSTEMS WHETHER IT'S APPARENT ON CAL WORKS WHO JOB I CAN'T FIND A STABLE PLACE TO LIVE. WHETHER IT'S APPARENT IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHOSE RESOLVE ALL THE ISSUES NECESSARY TO BE RESOLVED. AND CAN'T BE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR CHILD BUT FOR THE FACT THAT THEY CAN'T FIND A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE WHETHER IT'S THE ELDER ABUSE VICTIM WHO WE REMOVED FROM AN ABUSIVE CARETAKER. STABLE I'VE THEIR SITUATION BUT CAN'T FIND A PLACE TO LIVE WERE TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH -- WHOSE NAVIGATING A WORLD BUT LARGELY BY THEMSELVES AND HAVING DIFFICULTY -- OBTAINING HOUSING [inaudible] AND SO -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A FEW POINTS FOR YOU THIS MORNING BATTING CLEAN UP. THE FIRST IS THAT -- HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR CLIENTS IS IN A MULTI FACETED BUT IT'S REALLY DRIVEN BY TWO PRIMARY FACTORS. AND THAT'S A STAGNATING STAGNATING WAGES AND PUBLIC ASSISTANCE BENEFITS AND SKYROCKETING RENTS. THAT'S NOT. THAT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE BUT WE SAW FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE RECESSION WHEN. CAL ARTS GRANTS WERE CUT IN IMMEDIATE SPIKE AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG CARRACKS FAMILIES. THAT WAS COTERMINOUS ALMOST EXACTLY TO THE POINT WHEN THE STATE CUT CAL WORKS GRANTS AND IMMEDIATELY WE HAD MORE -- HOMELESS FAMILIES -- AND SO THE WAGES BENEFITS AND RISING RENTS AND HOMELESSNESS -- IS UNMISTAKABLE. SO -- ONE MESSAGE I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH YOU TODAY'S ANTI POVERTY STRATEGIES ARE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION STRATEGIES. AND FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AMONG THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION STRATEGIES YOU CAN ENGAGE IN. WE APPRECIATE MORE THAN APPRECIATE WE SO -- ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST GOVERNOR IN THE CURRENT GOVERNOR OF DONE TO RAISE WELFARE GRANTS SO THAT NO CHILD LIVES IN DEEP POVERTY. A VAST THE CREATION OF A STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND AN ALMOST DOUBLING OF THAT CREDIT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL INITIATIVES -- TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRY TO KEEP PACE WITH THEM BE ABLE TO PAY FOR RENT RENT AND IN CALIFORNIA. AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THAT THESE INCREASES ARE HISTORIC -- BY BY HISTORICAL COMPARISONS WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND ONE WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT. IS TO COMPARE THAT MAXIMUM GRANTS AND CAL WORKS TO THE HUD FAIR MARKET RENT SO IF YOU LOOK AT MAXIMUM GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF THREE AND COMPARE IT TO THE HARD FAIR MARKET RENT. FOR A TWO BEDROOM APARTMENT THE CALYX GRANT WOULD PAY 432% OF THAT FAIR MARKET RENT. NOW YOU ALL MIGHT SAY WELL THAT'S SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT AN OUT WIRE. IN SAN BERNADINO THE GRANT WOULD ON THAT CAL WORKS GRANT WOULD ONLY PAY FOR THREE QUARTERS OF THE FAIR MARKET RENT. IN LA AND SAN DIEGO IT'S A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF. AND RURAL AREAS BOTH IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE DON'T ESCAPE THIS PHENOMENON AS WELL. AND FRESNO MADERA HUMBOLDT -- THE CAL WORKS GRANT COULD NOT PAY FOR THE FAIR MARKET RENT IT WOULD BE LESS THAN 85%. AND SO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT ANTI POVERTY STRATEGIES AS HOMELESSNESS STRATEGIES -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR ACKNOWLEDGING. ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IN BETTING HOMELESSNESS. INTERVENTION RESOURCES WITH IN COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS MY COLLEAGUE ALLEY SITE AND DISCUSS THE SO I WON'T GO INTO. RE DESCRIBING THEM ABOUT THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY GET THE SERVICE SAYS TO A COW WORKS MOM. TO A FAMILY IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM TO A TRANSITION H. FOSTER YOUTH -- IS OFF AND WHAT WHAT CREATE SUCCESS FOR US LISTS -- AND WOOD WOULD REMAIN WOULD REMAIN HOMELESS -- THER'S SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES TO EMBEDDING THESE HOMELESSNESS RESOURCES WITH IN. THE TOOLBOX OF HUMAN SERVICES -- PROGRAM -- IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO UNIQUELY VULNERABLE PEOPLE IN THE STATE -- BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE THESE PROGRAMS HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT AND OTHER WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE FIRST. BENEFICIARIES OF THE CALYX HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM SHE'S IN YOLO COUNTY SHE WAS SHE WAS LIVING IN HER CAR WITH HER THREE CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY -- SHE WAS ESCAPING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SHE WAS ON THE RUN -- SHE FOUND THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY DAY CONNECTED HER IN YOLO COUNTY THEY CONNECTED HER WITH THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM TO PROTECT HER FROM HER ABUSER THEY CONNECTED HER WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. TO TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA OF HER ABUSE THEY CONNECTED HER WITH CHILD CARE AND EMPLOYMENT -- SERVICES TO BE ABLE TO PREPARE FOR EMPLOYMENT SHE COULDN'T FIND A PLACE TO LIVE. AND IT WAS INHIBITING HER ABILITY TO TO COMPLETE HER SUCCESS. ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE WAS GOING THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE THE STATE LAUNCHED A HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM. AND IT WAS THE FINAL PIECE OF SERVICES THAT ALLOWED HER. TO TO LEAVE THE ROLES AND SHE'S NOW GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AND OFF THE THE HUMAN SERVICES ROLES. THE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE CREATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS IT IT'S BROUGHT THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES INTO LOCAL HOMELESSNESS NETWORKS. MY LAST BOARD MEETING I ASKED MY MEMBERS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE MEANING FULLY ENGAGED IN YOUR LOCAL CONTINUE OF CARE. IT WAS ALMOST ALL OF THEM. IF I ASKED THAT QUESTION TEN YEARS AGO WOULD BE. TO SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES AND SO THE WORLD ARE COMING TOGETHER AND AND GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE THOSE WORLDS ARE COMING TOGETHER. THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER WE FACE -- BY COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU ASKED A PRIOR WITNESS CHAIRMAN CHIU IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY. SERVICES ARE ALL CRITICAL BUT WHAT WE'RE BUMPING UP AGAINST IS IS BEING ABLE TO FIND -- LANDLORDS -- THAT WILL RENT A DECENT PLACE A PRICE THAT OUR CLIENTS CAN AFFORD. AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE ARRAY I'M TELLING YOU FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES WE ARE BUMPING UP AGAINST THE SUPPLY PROBLEM AS THE KEY BARRIER. TO BEING ABLE TO EXPAND THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS SO QUICKLY GOING. INTO SOME AREAS OF OF SOLUTIONS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE ANTI POVERTY PROGRAMS. EXPANSIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- MAKE SURE WE ADD COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CALYX PROGRAM IN THE E. I. T. C. INTO AS A SIZES BE. SO THOSE PROGRAMS DON'T LOSE PACE -- AGAINST INFLATION. I THINK WE NEED TO MAINS MAINTAIN SUPPORT EVALUATE IN THE WAY THAT MY COLLEAGUE -- MISS SUDDEN TALKED ABOUT THESE HUMAN SERVICES SPECIFIC HOMELESSNESS INTERVENTIONS -- AND BRING THEM TO SCALE -- THERE THEY DO NOT SERVE THE ENTIRE POTENTIAL POPULATION THE BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM IS THE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. TWELVE COUNTIES GOT FUNDED -- OUT OF TWENTY THREE THAT APPLIED -- THAT PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE AND COUNTIES ARE ABOUT TO START CLOSING DOWN INTAKE AND SO WILL ASK THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET PROCESS TO RE AUTHORIZE -- THAT BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM I WOULD LIKE TO TO CONCUR WITH MS REPORT I THINK THE STATE HAS TO INVEST IN LONG TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES. WE HAVE MANY CLIENTS THAT WE HELP WHOSE WHOSE ONLY BARRIER. TO STAYING HOUSED IS THE GAP BETWEEN WHAT THEY MAKE. AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO LIVE. AND WHAT THEY MAKE IS THE MOST THAT THEY CAN THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN ARE GAINFULLY EMPLOYED -- AND SO IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US -- TO FIGURE HOW WE COULD STEM THE TIDE. AGAINST HOMELESSNESS UNTIL WE CAN DEAL WITH THE SUPPLY ISSUE WITHOUT CREATING EXPANDED -- RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. AND I THINK. ONCE WE DO THAT. WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION ON THE COUNTY HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE THE DIFFICULTY FINDING LANDLORDS WHO MAY HAVE A UNIT BUT ARE UNWILLING TO RENT TO OUR CLIENTS WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SECTION EIGHT VOUCHER. WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEIR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEIR SUBSIDY IN SOME WAY COMES FROM GOVERNMENT. AND SO WE WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT PRIOR WITNESSES -- THAT RECOMMENDED ADDING SOURCE OF INCOME -- TO THE TENANT PROTECTIONS -- AND FINALLY I THINK WE NEED TO SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME FOCUSING ON THE NEEDS OF TRANSITION H. FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE NAVIGATING THIS WORLD. AND MANY CASES WITH VERY LITTLE SUPPORT SOMETIMES WITH SUBSIDIES BUT NOT THE HELP NAVIGATING A SYSTEM THAT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH RESOURCES NEVER MIND PEOPLE. WHO'VE GROWN UP -- WITHOUT THAT PARENTAL SUPPORT THANK YOU. I THANK YOU LET'S SAID BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS -- I'LL KICK IT OFF WITH ONE QUESTION TO MISTER MECCA -- I WAS VERY STRUCK BY YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN A DROP AND CAL WORKS. ASSISTANCE AND AND HOMELESSNESS AND IT I WANT TO JUST PUBLICLY TO MY CHAIR AND POTENTIALLY -- STAFF AS WELL AS THOSE OF YOU WHO WORK ON THESE ISSUES WHICH IS OFTENTIMES OF ANTI POVERTY STRATEGIES WE INTUITIVELY KNOW THE IMPACT ON HOMELESSNESS. ART BUT THE DEBATE WE HAVE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS USUALLY A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH BUDGET WE HAVE. AND HOW GENEROUS WERE FEELING IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON WHAT THE IMPACT OF A DOLLAR NOT SPENT IN AN AREA IS GOING TO HAVE IN OTHER AREAS SO -- WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE MISS REPORT A FEW YEARS AGO HAD ASKED MY OFFICE TO INTRODUCE A BILL. THAT HAS BECOME THE HOUSING FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH ADDRESSES THE REALITY THAT IF YOU'RE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ON THE STREETS. YOUR HEALTH CARE COST YOUR IMPACT ON THE EMERGENCY ROOMS ON IT JAIL HEALTH SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LET'S SAY IT'S SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PERSON. AND IT ONLY COST US SAY NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO PUT A SUPPORT OF HOUSING ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS. TO AVOID SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF COSTS WHAT I HAVE WONDERED IS FOR MANY OF THE SOCIAL SERVICE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THAT ARE WITHIN. MEN OF CHAIRS COMMITTEE THAT SHE IS FIGHTING. FOR HOW CAN WE PUT THE INTERSECTION ALLEY TOGETHER HOW DO WE PULL THAT DATA OUT SO THAT WE KNOW THAT IF WE WERE TO INCREASE FUNDING TO THEIR FOR TO THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT THAT COULD HELP US. SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EXPENSES WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS SO I WANT TO SORT OF PUT THAT OUT AS A AS A CONCEPT AS A POTENTIALLY CHALLENGE FOR FOR STAFF AND ADVOCATES TO THINK ABOUT. BUT WOULD LOVE TO TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION OF HOW WE HOW WE SHOW. ALL OF THOSE LINKS AND AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SPEND AS AS AS WELL AS WE CAN AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN AS WELLS AS HUMANELY AS WE CAN. WITHOUT I KNOW -- MS QUIRK SILVA HAS SOME COMMENTS -- ON THE HOUSING THAT MODEL WHERE YOU MAY BRING AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. I KNOW ORANGE COUNTY IS LOOKING TOWARDS A MODEL -- TO BUILD A MENTAL HEALTH FACILITY BUT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME KAISER AND CAL OPTIMA PUT N SOME DOLLARS I THINK THAT. ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF THE EXPERIENCE THAT THEY ARE -- RECEIVING SO MANY CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS COMING INTO THEIR EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT THEY'RE REALIZING THAT THIS IN FACT IS A MODEL THAT IF SUPPORTED WOULD GIVE THEM SOME RELIEF AT THE HOSPITALS -- BUT THAT BEING SAID I WANTED TO ASK IN AGAIN WHOEVER CAN ANSWER THIS ON THE SECTION EIGHT HOUSING WHICH I KNOW IS A DONE THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I KNOW THAT THERE WAS. A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE SECTION EIGHT HOUSING -- ALLOTMENT OR TO THAT END HAS THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED AND WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING A TAKE A STAB AT THAT -- SO THAT HAS BEEN A A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL -- IT IS NOT YET PASSED -- AND THERE ARE SOME OF THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHETHER WORK REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED SHOULD BE ADDED TO RECEIVE SECTION EIGHT SO THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD. SIGNIFICANTLY -- THIS PLACE WE THINK A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING VALUE NOW. SO IN CALIFORNIA IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO ABOUT THEM. I MEAN YOU COULD CERTAINLY AND WE WOULD RECOMMEND SEPARATE AND APART FROM WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE --% STATE FUNDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN YOU IT WOULD BE UP TO YOU TO BE ABLE TO SET WITH THOSE. BUT THE GENEROSITY OF THAT SUPPORT IS. AND THEN ONE ONE LAST QUESTION ON THE MODEL WHERE WE ARE LOOKING AT NOW OF COURSE HOUSING FIRST. WITH SUPPORT FROM EMERGENCY HOUSING. RAPID RESPONSE IN OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS VOUCHERS THINGS LIKE THAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH IN THE SENSE THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD NOT BE ABLE -- TO MANAGE ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT HOUSING FIRST. EMERGENCY SHELTER THEY ALSO WILL NOT DO WELL -- ARE WE LOOKING AT ANY I AS FAR IS UP A MENTAL HEALTH -- SOME TYPE OF HOUSING I KNOW WE WENT THROUGH THIS DECADES AGO BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE -- INDIVIDUALS WHERE THE EMERGENCY MODEL AND AT THE HOUSING ENOUGH ALONE DOES NOT WORK ARE THERE ANY MODELS OUT THERE. TO ME I THINK THE THE MODEL OF SUPPORT OF HOUSING -- IT IS JUST THAT WHERE EVEN IF IT'S HOUSING FIRST YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO BECOME STABILIZED -- AND AND MAKE THOSE SERVICES AVAILABLE THAT'S WITH A PARTNERSHIP -- FOR EXAMPLE IN LA AND OTHER PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE MOUNT TELL DEPARTMENT. THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER PROVIDING THE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT WE WE CERTAINLY AND I'VE MET LOTS OF THESE PEOPLE WHO. STRUGGLED FOR YEARS ON THE STREETS -- DUE TO MASS HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER -- HAVING A PLACE UPON A PLACE TO LIVE THERE STABILIZE THE GOT THE HELP AND NOW ARE. THRIVING WORKING CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTH FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR THAT S.. AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME IF I COULD JUST MENTION -- NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS PROPOSITION TWO THAT WAS JUST RECENTLY PASSED BY VOTERS. WILL CREATE -- REVENUE BOND TO BOND AGAINST SOME OF THE MENTAL HEALTH. SERVICES ACT DOLLARS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND WILL. PROVIDE SERVICES IN HOUSING FOR THOSE FOR THAT POPULATION. IN IF I MIGHT. ALSO TO MR CHOOSE POINT -- THE STATE CREATED A MEDICAID -- SADDAM MEDICAID WAIVER FOR THE WHOLE PERSON CARE. PILOT PROGRAM TO TRY TO GET OUT THE USE OF MEDICAID DOLLARS -- TO HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE IDEA THAT WE'RE SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY EARNED MONEY IN OTHER SYSTEMS. BECAUSE THERE'S NO HOUSING THE ONE THAT WAIVER THAT WE WERE GRANTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS THAT WE COULD NOT PAY FOR THE HOUSING -- WITH THE MEDICAID DOLLARS AND SO THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL. ADDS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS I BELIEVE TO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WHICH MAKES IT THE WHOLE WHOLE PERSON. CARE PILOT AND I THINK THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT HOW THAT HOW THOSE PILOTS WILL WORK WHEN WE CAN ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE HOUSING AS WELL AS THE OTHER. SUPPORT OF SERVICES [inaudible] I'M SURE. WHEN WE THINK OF CREATIVE WAYS OF SOLVING SOME OF OUR ISSUES -- THAT'S WHAT WANT ONE OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME DURING OUR DREAM BIG I. E. WE HAVE OUR MILLENNIALS TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS. THE TALK ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE BARRIERS THAT WE ALL HAVE BECAUSE SO WE'VE ALREADY TRIED THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY WITHIN THEMBI'S WE THINK OF EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG. BUT THE MULLIN MEALS ARE YOU'D GET TOGETHER AND THEY SAID THEY LOOK AT THESE BIG SOLUTIONS AND THEY HAVE NO BARRIERS ARE SAY IN ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS. THAT THEY HAD TO HOMELESSNESS -- SAID LET'S DO WHAT AND I BELIEVE IT'S HAWAII DOES. WITH A DOCTOR CAN PRESCRIBE. HOUSING. AS PART OF THE TREATMENT FOR THAT PERSON. AND SO WHAT WOULD WE LOOK AT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE ARE OTHER BARRIERS RELATED TO THAT. BUT I THINK THAT BEING CREATIVE I THINK IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT I THINK THE WORK THAT YOU ALL DO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE TELLING US ABOUT THE GAP. THAT WE HAVE BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE SOLUTIONS AND I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THANK YOU. DOCTOR YOU READY PRESCRIBE SOME HOUSING. I HAVE. HAD READY BUT I'D PROBABLY PURSUE SEPARATE AND APART -- WANTED TO SPEAK TO YOU MISTER MARTIN AND ASK ABOUT THE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS WHO YOU HAD REACHED OUT SPECIFICALLY TO IN FRESNO -- OF THE I'M QUITE INTERESTED IN THE PROPOSAL THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND WOULD LOVE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IF I CAN. JOIN YOU IN THAT VENTURE BUT WANTS TO REACH AND DISCUSS WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS WELL AND I'M JUST I'M WONDERING WHO SPECIFICALLY IT WAS. ONE FRESNO -- ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR THE PERSON HELP COORDINATE THAT IS HERE TODAY SELF -- SO SHE HELPED HOST THAT -- CONVENING SPECIFICALLY -- WE HAVE A LOT OF COUNT BECAUSE FRESNO HAS A A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT SURROUNDS IT THAT'S A FAIRLY RURAL WE HAD A LOT OF VARIOUS COUNTY OFFICIALS -- COME TO THAT ONE I'M A LOT OF THIS UC'S FOR THAT AREA CAME -- AND CA FEW DEVELOPERS AS WELL SO SEND A MAJOR LARGER ENTITIES THAT WE MAY WANTS TO INCORPORATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITY FOUNDATION AS WELL AS THE SIERRA HEALTH FOUNDATION. ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAY ALLOW US TO BRING IN SOME PLAN TO BE DOLLARS AS WELL SO -- WILL WANTS TO REACH OUT TO MISS SMITH AND TO WORK WITH YOU GUYS ON THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH LATER ABOUT THE ONE OF THESE SUGGESTIONS ARE AMONG MANY MISTER MARTIN YOU IS SUCH A STATE THAT AND THEY'RE ALSO -- HE WAS NOT QUITE SURE. THAT THAT IS SO THE IDEA OF A CENTRAL A STATE WIDE THE COORDINATING AGENCY ONE STOP SHOP -- IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING WORE A A SAID THE UNDER WALKING. YEAH I THINK THE THE IDEA WOULD DO WITH THE FLEXIBLE AS TO BE THAT KIND OF THAT -- PROGRAM THAT WOULD HAVE CENTRALIZED RESOURCES -- AND WE WERE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW KIND OF COMBINING FOR VARIOUS POPULATIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE KIND OF RIGHT NOW WE'RE WE HAVE BOUTIQUE. PROGRAMS -- THROUGHOUT STATE GOVERNMENT -- AND AND SO WE'RE LOOKING TO KIND OF CENTRALIZED THINGS -- THAT'S NOT TO SAY EVERY PROGRAM WOULD BE UNDER THIS UMBRELLA -- BUT IT IT IS TO LOOK AT SOME SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND MAKING SURE THEY'RE ALL UNDER ONE CENTRALIZED RESOURCE. AND WE ARE DEALING WITH A VERY -- WHICH ISSUE THE AND ALL. HOUSING AND THE HUMAN SERVICES -- AND OR LOCAL OR STATE THAT EVERYTHING BUT THE AS I SAID IN THE BEGINNING YOU KNOW COMMENT I THINK WE NEED. TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF A STATE WIDE. ON TO THAT ENOUGH GOVERNOR'S OFFICE A TASK FORCE TO YOU KNOW. TO IN A ONE AGENCY DOESN'T KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT THE OTHER ONE THE STORIES THERE'S STILL A LOT OF GAP. AND LAG COORDINATION. GREAT AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WE WE DO HAVE A STATE HOMELESS ACCORDING TO COUNSEL AND I DO KNOW THAT -- GOVERNOR NEWSOME HAS PROPOSED THE POSITION OF A HOMELESS CZAR TO BRING ALL THIS TOGETHER SO LOOKING FORWARD.
