OUR HEARING TODAY. INVOLVES THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY. AND WHO WILL BE BURDENED BY THIS EMERGENCY. WE TALK ABOUT NATURAL DISASTERS OCCURRING IN THE CONTEXT OF AN EVER WARMING INCREASINGLY VOLATILE CLIMATE. WHICH YOU NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER THAN OUR BACKYARD TO SEE THESE IMPACTS. THE RISK AND FREQUENCY OF THESE DISASTERS EVENTS COMPEL THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS CRISIS FROM EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT LINES. AND DID EXAMINE MORE CLOSELY WHO WILL BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND POPULATIONS WILL BE IN THE SPOTLIGHT OF TODAY'S HEARING. WORKING PEOPLE WOMEN OF COLOR PEOPLE LIVING IN POVERTY PEOPLE LIVING WITH PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES DEPENDENT ON MACHINES. SENIORS AND THE ELDERLY PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES PEOPLE MET MAY LIKELY BE LESS. ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE RECEIVED WARNINGS AND UPDATES NEEDED TO SAFELY EVACUATE TO PROTECT THEM. YOU SEE THE FOLKS IN GERMANY SUFFERING. MANY LIVING IN OLDER AND DISABLED CARE DYING FROM EXTREME FLOODING. SEEM THE SAME IN MY OWN BACKYARD. GOING THROUGH THE WILL OF THE FIRE. IS BACK. I SAW MY OWN FAMILY. GET IMPACTED AND IT'S TRAUMATIZED ME IN A WAY THAT- SORT OF LED ME TO ACTION HERE BUT WATCHING MY NINETY TWO YEAR OLD GRANDFATHER STUCK ON A ROAD FOR EIGHT HOURS- IN A LOG JAM ON THE ON THE P. C. H. NO ACCESS TO A RESTROOM ENDED UP IN THE I. C. U. N. MONTHS FEW MONTHS AFTER THAT- WE LOST. OUR WEATHER THAT KIND OF VICTIM IS SEEN AS A VICTIM OF A CLIMATE DISASTER NOT- YOU KNOW THE STATISTICS DON'T DON'T ALWAYS TELL THAT STORY BUT THIS IS VERY PERSONAL FOR SO MANY PEOPLE AND I APPRECIATE THE MEMBERS WHO WERE ABLE TO SHOW UP TODAY AND I'M SORRY TO THOSE WHO. WERE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE REMOTELY YOU COULDN'T MAKE IT UP TO THIS HEARING BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME THIS COMMITTEE PUSHES ON THESE ISSUES- WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHERE RISK IS INVOLVED AT RISK AND TRY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY IS A STATE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE SCALE THAT RISK. BUT I WOULD POSIT AS A BASIS FOR THIS HEARING THAT WE'RE NOTMEETING THAT CHALLENGE DESPITE OUR BEST EFFORTS AT THIS POINT. BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TOLD US CALIFORNIA'S NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO PROTECT ITS MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM NATURAL DISASTERS. AND LAST MONTH THE GENDER EQUITY POLICY CENTER. WHO WERE WERE REALLY THRILLED IS JOINING US HERE TODAY PRONOUNCED. TOO RECENTLY PROPOSED CRIME RESILIENCY BONDS. IS FAILING THE CLIMATE JUSTICE TEST FOR THE LACK OF SCALE. AND A LACK OF ATTENTION TO VULNERABLE COMMITTEES COMMUNITIES. I'M AUTHOR OF ONE OF THOSE PHONE MEASURES. I AM FORCING MYSELF AND OTHERS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK. AT WHERE THE FUNDING FUNDING WILL GO ESPECIALLY AS WE NEGOTIATE OUR WAY THROUGH THE END OF THE SESSION AND LOOK FORWARD. TO THE FUTURE. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT- TOOK KNOWLEDGE OUR OUR GUESTS HERE TODAY. I KNOW THAT- WE ALSO HAVE. OUR LEAD WITNESS BEEN A TRUTH TELLER- AND FRANKLY- A JARRING JOLT. OF SOME DOOM BUT NOT ONE BASED ON- ANY SPECULATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY. THE FACTS ON THE GROUND FACING US HERE TODAY. HIS CONTINUES. TO LOOK AT. PASSIVE TRAJECTORIES TOWARDS DISASTER. WHETHER WE'RE CONTINUING TO BUILD DEEPER INTO THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE. FAILING TO ADEQUATELY SECURE OUR ENERGY SUPPLY AND MANAGE OUR GREED. OR ABLE TO EXAMINE- FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO DECARBONISE IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE MOST VULNERABLE MEANWHILE FLOOD INSURANCE FIRE INSURANCE. HOSPITALS COOLING CENTERS ARE ALL AND INADEQUATELY STAFFED- AND NOT PROTECTED THE EXTENT WE NEED TO THE QUESTIONS WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO EXAMINE IN FURTHER DETAIL HERE TODAY OR- HOW ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE. IN THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PROTECTED. THOSE WHO LIVE IN CARE HOMES THOSE YOU NEED OXYGEN FOLKS WITH DISABILITIES. PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO GET READY FOR WHAT LIES AHEAD. AND WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO TO WORK BETTER WITH THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND WITH THESE INDIVIDUALS NGOS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO COORDINATE THESE EFFORTS TO FUND THESE EFFORTS AND BETTER ADDRESS THESE CRISES. I'LL NOW DEFER TO A VICE CHAIR OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE- SHOULD YOU HAVE ANY OPENING REMARKS AS WELL AS TO OUR- OUR SEMI ARMOR AGUILAR CURRY HERE TOO WITH US HERE TODAY SO WELCOME IS A MEMBER THANKS FOR JOINING US. THANK YOU FOR SIGNING THANK SENATOR STERN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN CALLING THIS HEARING. TO INVESTIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE AND ITS EFFECTS ON CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES. FIRST OFF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. CONSIDER THE DATA SUBMITTED BY THE US NATIONAL OCEAN OCEANOGRAPHIC. ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION ON BILLION DOLLAR WEATHER AND CLIMATE DISASTERS. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NO I HAS TALLIED THE NUMBER OF DISASTERS. THAT HAVE RESULTED IN A LOSS ESTIMATES OF A BILLION OR MORE. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THERE WERE THREE SUCH DISASTERS WHILE IN TWENTY TWENTY THERE WERE TWENTY TWO. THAT'S AFFECTING CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING OVER THE PAST DECADE. ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT LAST YEAR'S WILDFIRES. AND THE BURN FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES OF MORE THAN 4% OF THE STATE'S A HUNDRED MILLION ACRES OF LAND. CALIFORNIA'S ALSO EXPERIENCING FLOODING DEBRIS SLIDES C. RISE RECORDS. SETTING HE RAVES AND ARE NOW IN THE GRIPS OF A SEVERE DROUGHT. WELL THE STATE. OUR COUNTIES AND CITIES ARE BETTER PREPARED NOW THAN EVER. WE'VE NEVER BEEN BEFORE RESPONDING TO THESE TYPES OF EMERGENCIES. CLIMATE CHANGE IS MOVING THE BAR AND WE NEED TO JUST OW WE ARE PREPARING AND RESPONDING TO THESE DISASTERS WHEN THEY STRIKE. WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THESE EFFORTS ARE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED. COMMUNITIES ARE NOT LEFT BEHIND. THE US AGREE. THAT CHANGE IS REAL AND IT'S EFFECTS ARE NOT GOING AWAY SOON WHAT WE NEED TO BE HERE TODAY IS HOW TO PLAN AND ADAPT FOR THE FUTURE HOW DO WE CREATE A BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOCUS ON PREPARING AND PROTECTING PEOPLE AND OUR ECONOMY IN THE FACE OF DISASTER. FOR CRIME EMERGENCIES WE WANT TO KNOW THE LESSONS LEARNED. AND WHAT ARE THE POSITIVE STEPS CALIFORNIA MUST MAKE TO ADDRESS OUR DISASTER VULNERABILITIES. PLEASE GIVE A SPECIFIC ADVICE ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW AND IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOT ALL COMPANIES ARE EQUAL OR ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO RESPOND DISASTER AGAIN THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOR CALLING THIS IMPORTANT. INFORMATIONAL HEARING THANK YOU THANK YOU MR VICE CHAIR OF SOME REGULAR KERR YOUR MAKING OPENING REMARKS JUST CLICK LIKE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THE NUMBER ONE THING WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT AS PEOPLE. AND SO MANY TIMES WE THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE THE LANDSCAPE BUT THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU. JUST SIMPLY AND APTLY PUT- THAT'LL BE THE CORE FOCS OF THIS HEARING TODAY AND- WITHOUT FURTHER ADO- WE WANT TO WELCOME OUR FIRST. PANELIST DAVID WALLACE WELLS. HI DAVE IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED JOURNALIST. AND AUTHOR OF A BOOK THAT WOKE ME UP. THE UNINHABITABLE EARTH HE'S ALSO AN EDITOR AND A FREQUENT WRITER ON CLIMATE CHANGE IN NEW YORK MAGAZINE AND- OTHER PUBLICATIONS. SO WELCOME MISTER WALLACE WELLS IN. AT YOUR- AT YOUR CONVENIENCE- PLEASE BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU SO MUCH SOUNDER- THANK YOU. ALSO TO THE VICE CHAIR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON- TODAY SPEAKING ABOUT THE RISKS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ESPECIALLY TO THE DISADVANTAGED. IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT WAS ONCE CALLED THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS KILLED ACCORDING TO THE CDC THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND AMERICANS. THAT SAME NUMBER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. DIE IN THE EVEN AN UNEXCEPTIONAL HERE NEW RESEARCH SHOWS FROM THE AIR POLLUTION PRODUCED BY THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS. WE DECARBONISE THOSE LIVES COULD BE SAVED. IN THE U. S. AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE A QUALIFIES AS ENVIABLE AIR QUALITY ACCORDING TO THE IDC. THE CLEAN AIR ACT IS STILL SAVING THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND AMERICAN LIVES EVERY YEAR. DELIVERING ANNUAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF MORE THAN THREE TRILLION DOLLARS THIRTY TWO TIMES THE COST OF ACTING AND- IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THE MOST MEMORABLE IMAGES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN AS ORANGE LANDSCAPES AND DARKNESS AT NOON. MANY OF THOSE AIR POLLUTION GAINS COULD BE UNDONE BY THE SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES. IN TWENTY TWENTY SMOKE FROM THOSE FIRES ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN HALF OF ALL AIR POLLUTION IN THE WESTERN U. S. UNIT MORE PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE BURNING SOUTH OF FOREST INFILTRATED THE LAWNS OF AMERICANS LIVING IN THOSE STATES. THAT FROM ALL OTHER INDUSTRIAL. AND HUMAN ACTIVITY COMBINED. IN SEPTEMBER OF THAT. TWENTY FOUR OF THE TWENTY FIVE MOST POLLUTED CITIES IN THE WORLD. WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA AND OREGON. TO A CERTAIN DEGREE WILDFIRE SMOKE IS THE MOST DEMOCRATIC THREATS TO CAN'T BE CONTAINED OR CORRALLED OR COMPARTMENTALIZED I'M SPEAKING TO YOU NOW FROM NEW YORK WHAT'S THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS THE AIR QUALITY INDEX HAS BEEN WELL OVER A HUNDRED DANGEROUS NOT JUST A DOZEN UNDERLYING CONDITIONS THAT EVEN HEALTHY PEOPLE. BECAUSE OF FIRES BURNING TODAY IN YOUR STATE AND OREGON AND WASHINGTON UP THE COAST IN CANADA AND DOWN IN THE BOTTOM. THE ENTIRE CONTINENT IS BLANKETED IN SMOKE. THE MEANING OF THAT SMOKE IS GOING CLEAR TO US BY THE DAY WHICH MAY BE ONE REASON. IN ADDITION TO THE DRAMATICALLY WORSENING FIRE SEASONS. SO MANY CALIFORNIANS SEEM WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FUTURES IN THE STATE. IF YOU LIVE IN CENTRAL LA OR DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO YOU DON'T REALLY NEED TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR HOUSE BURNING DOWN. YOU DO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE SMOKE AND THAT SMOKE IS TERRIBLE. THERE'S ALMOST NO ASPECT OF MODERN LIFE WHICH PARTICULAR POLLUTION DOESN'T DAMAGE AND HERE IS JUST A PARTIAL LIST OF THOSE IMPACTS THERE'S- GDP WITH A 10% INCREASE IN POLLUTION REDUCING OUTPUT BY ALMOST A FULL PERCENTAGE POINT IN A GIVEN YEAR. THERE'S COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE THAN IN LOS ANGELES WHEN SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR AIR PURIFIERS WERE INSTALLED IN SCHOOLS IN RESPONSE TO A LOCAL CATHOLIC. STUDENT PERFORMANCE IMPROVED AS MUCH AS IT WOULD IF THE CLASS SIZES WERE REDUCED BY A THIRD. PARTY SEES MORE COME INCLUDED THERE I JUST CAN'T SERVE THE COUNTLESS VARIETIES ACUTE AND CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES LIKE ASTHMA AND STROKES. VOLATILITY TO CODE GROWS THE INCIDENCE OF ALZHEIMER'S CAN TRIPLE DEMENTIA RATES. GROW TOO AS TO THOSE OF PARKINSON'S. I SAID EARLIER. IN FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE ARE RELATIVELY SPEAKING NON DISCRIMINATORY. THAT'S OF COURSE AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION SINCE THE WEALTHY AND WELL CONNECTED CAN AFFORD TO GET AWAY. DOWN FOR THEIR HOMES OR THEIR PURE FIRES TO LIVE FARTHER FROM THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE FOR THE FIRES THEMSELVES ARE LIKELY TO BE. BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF CIVIC CLIMATE CHANGE AS A WHOLE. IS POWERFULLY DISCRIMINATORY IN FACTTHIS IS TRUE AT EVERY LEVEL OF ANALYSIS. THE POOR COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD ARE THOSE WILL FACE THE MOST INTENSE IMPACTS. WITHIN NATIONS IT'S THE POOR REGIONS WITHIN STATES AND CITIES THIS THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES. WITH THE LEAST RESOURCES FROM THE FURTHEST FROM POLITICAL POWER. WERE SUBJECTED. TO THE GROSSEST CLIMATE INJUSTICE. THE WILDFIRE FACED BY LATINOS IN THE UNITED STATES IS MORE THAN TWICE THE SIZE THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE WITH MORE THAN ONE THIRD LIVING AREAS DEFINED AS EXTREME WILDFIRE RISKS. IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN 60% OF ALL NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY HAS BEEN IN WILDFIRE PRONE AREAS WHICH- TAKEN WITH THE EARLIER STATISTICS SUGGEST THAT THE STATE NEEDS A MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE HOUSING POLICY. AND THEN IT MUST ALSO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. SEA LEVEL RISE AND COASTAL EROSION IS LESS TALKED ABOUT THREAT IN THE STATE BUT THOSE RISKS ARE PROFOUND. WE'RE ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT IT MEANS. IN THE CASE OF MANAGED RETREAT LIKE THAT UNDERTAKEN IN PACIFICA. BY TWENTY FIFTY WHAT USED TO BE A HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD WILL BE HITTING SAN DIEGO EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THE IMPACT OF INTENSIFYING HEATWAVES WILL BE FELT MOST INTENSELY BY THE STATES DISENFRANCHISED AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. BY TWENTY FIFTY AS MANY AS TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS WILL LIKELY DIED HE DISSECTS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. ALREADY COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FROM EARLY MARCH A DENTIST AND HAD HAD TO GO WITHOUT SAFETY DRINKING WATER DURING OUR I'M GOING TO START DROUGHT. THIS IS WHY KAMEL HARRISON SAID RIGHTLY THAT THE STATE WATER CRISIS IT'S A MATTER OF RACIAL INJUSTICE IT IS THIS YEAR THEY'RE ALREADY BEEN TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE CASES OF WATER SHORTAGE IN THE STATE. BY YEAR'S END THAT NUMBER COULD GROW TEN FOLD WHICH ISN'T EVEN TO MENTION AT THE FUTURE OF GROWING DROUGHT AND AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T JUST PUNISHMENT. IT'S ALSO OPPORTUNITY. IF WE MUST ADAPT LET'S DO IT IN WAYS THAT ALLOW US TO BUILD A BETTER WORLD NOT JUST A MORE PROTECTED ONE A MORE EQUAL WORLD NOT JUST A LESS ANXIOUS ONE AND MORE JUST WORLD NOT JUST A MORE INDOOR AND ONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR WELLS WELLS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A PANEL OF EXPERTS ON THE SUBJECT OF CLIMATE DISASTER RISKS AND INEQUITY. FIRST UP IS DO WE ORGANIZE WE'RE GONNA STAY WITH QUESTIONS WITH FIRST PRESENTER DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM OUR- I GUESS YOU WELCOME TO. IN IN- MR WELLS WELLS I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD JUST I WOULD THANK YOU FOR TESTIFYING BEFORE US TODAY WE KNOW YOU JUST TESTIFIED BEFORE US SENATE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST WEEK- WE'RE HOPING THAT THE WAKE UP CALL OCCURS- BACK IN WASHINGTON AS WELL- BUT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS CALIFORNIA PROPERLY PREPARED. THE SHORT ANSWER IS NO- THERE ISN'T REALLY ANYWHERE IN THE US AND REALLY KNOW WHERE IN THE pPREPARED AT THE MOMENT FOR THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE COMING OUR WAY BUT CALIFORNIA IS YOU KNOW IF AUSTRALIA IS THE UNUSUAL CASE IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT FOR BEING A WEALTHY COUNTRY THAT IS ALREADY REALLY BUCKLED UNDER BY CARBON TAX AND EXPECTING MUCH MORE INTENSE ONES CALIFORNIA IS SORT OF A SIMILAR- EXAMPLE WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS TO SAY IT IS A STATE WITH ENORMOUS RESOURCES. ENORMOUS POLITICAL CAPACITY WHICH IS- FACING SOME INCREDIBLY INTENSE- YOU KNOW ON RUSSIAN CLIMATE STRESS I FOCUSE ON AIR POLLUTION THAT IS THE ONE THAT STRIKES ME IS THE MOST PRESSING- THE HEALTH TOLLS AND MENTAL HEALTH GOALS ARE QUITE DRAMATIC IN ADDITION TO ALL THE RISKS THAT WE ALREADY KNOW FROM THE FIRES THEMSELVES AND I THINK THAT THE STATE AS A WHOLE. BEGINNING TO WAKE UP TO THOSE THREATS BUT WE HAVEN'T YET REALLY STARTED TO THINK THROUGH HOW WE SHOULD RESPOND THEM BOTH ON THE FOREST MANAGEMENT AND ELECTRIC GRADE SIDE BUT ALSO ON YOU KNOW EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP OUR AIR- PROTECT COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BUY EXPENSIVE AIR FILTERS AND THAT SORT OF THING WE CAN'T BE IMPOSING THOSE KINDS OF. HEALTH IMPACTS ON THE DISADVANTAGED AND AS WE HEAD FORWARD INTO. A WORLD THAT WILL BE MUCH LESS FORGIVING. AND I GIVE MY ONE FOLLOW UP FOR HIM TO THE NEXT PANEL AS JUST BE. IT IN A IN A BUSINESS IS YOU SCENARIO IF WE CAN. INVESTING AT THE PACE WE AREN'T RESILIENCE. AND APPROACHING THE CHALLENGE THE WAY WE ARE- BEYOND JUST THE HEAT SCENARIOS I KNOW YOU WOULD. PUT OUT A STATISTIC OF. POTENTIALLY TEN THOUSAND HEAT RELATED DEATHS. OF AGRICULTURAL WORKERS HI IN THE NEXTDECADE- BUT OVERALL- DOES IT WHAT IS THIS ACTUALLY START TO LOOK LIKE FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE IS THIS. MASS MIGRATIONS ARE WE GONNA HAVE. YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT GLOBAL REFUGEE CRISIS OCCURRING COULD WE SEE THE SAME KIND OF SCENARIO IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT INTERNAL MIGRATION IS MUCH MORE COMMON IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE THREATS AND- CROSS BORDER MIGRATIONS BUT WHAT I WORRY ABOUT MORE THAN THE- THOSE SOURCES- YEAH. TRUNCHEONS IS THAT WE SORT OF LEARNED TO LIVE WITH A WORLD THAT IS DEFINED BY MUCH MORE SUFFERING- JUST TO CORRECT YOUR SORRY I DIDN'T. MEAN TO HIM DOESN'T HAVE A CULTURAL WORKERS EVERY YEAR IS JUST TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE YOU KNOW THE LINE SURE THOSE WILL BE. THOSE WHO AFTER WORK OUTSIDE AND HE WITHOUT PROTECTION WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY I THINK IT'S- CRITICAL THAT. WE YOU KNOW WE TRY TO LEGISLATE MORE PROJECT PROTECTION FOR THOSE WORKERS. I THINK THAT THE SCARIEST FUTURE. IS NOT ONE IN WHICH- WE ABANDON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND STOP FARMING IT IT'S ONE IN WHICH WE CONTINUE TO LIVE. IN THAT COMMUNITY CONTINUE TO FARM AND COMMUNITIES AND WHICH WE JUST BECOME OKAY. WITH MANY OF THOSE WORKERS DYING EVERY SINGLE YEAR FROM YOUR RELATED DEATHS. I THINK THE SAME WARRIOR TIES TO MANY OF THE OTHER. KIND OF RISKS THAT WE HAVE- WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADAPT. AND IN ADOPTING YOU CAN DESIGN A BETTER AND MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE BUT THERE'S ALSO THE RISK THAT WE SIMPLY SIMPLY NORMALIZED. A GROWING SCALE OF THREAT. EXCEPT MUCH MORE HUMOR AND HUMOR HUMAN SUFFERING AND THE HUMAN DYING. AND MOVE FORWARD AS THOUGH. OUTCOMES AND KIND OF FEATURES THAT A DECADE OR TWO AGO WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WERE UNTHINKABLE. I'M SIMPLY BECOME YOU KNOW THE WHOLE PICTURE OF OUR LIVES. WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN AND THAT'S ONE REASON. WHY WE NEED TO ACT PREEMPTIVELY. TO MAKE AND THAT. HE'D BEEN IN THE EVENT OF TRULY GRUESOME CRIMES. A IMPACT ON HIM LIFE. IS NOT NEARLY SO GREAT. WHAT THANK YOU FOR THE SOBER. AND VERY TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- THAT NORMALIZATIONOF HUMAN SUFFERING IN THE DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE IS GOING TO BE A CENTRAL FOCUS FOR THIS THIS HEARING AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ON THE PLANET I TELLING THAT TRUTH WELL LET'S DIG DEEPER INTO THAT ISSUE- IN OUR NEXT PANEL WITH NANCY COHEN. WHO'S HERE WITH THE GENDER EQUITY POLICY INSTITUTE AND RECENTLY PUT OUT A REPORT THAT WILL PUT A SOMEBODY'S NORMALIZATION IS OF HUMAN SUFFERING AND THE DISCRIMINATORY EFFECTS AND MUCH MUCH STARKER RELIEF SO- MISS COLIN WELCOME TO WELCOME THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND- YOU CAN PROCEED AT YOUR- CONVENIENCE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN- AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING- WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO JOIN YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN SHOW YOU SOME OF OUR REPORTS. AND THE GENDER EQUITY POLICY INSTITUTE IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN THINK TANK BASED IN LOS ANGELES AND- SENATOR STERN MENTIONED. WE RECENTLY PURCHASED ARE. WE RECENTLY. PUT OUT A REPORT HAILING THE CLIMATE JUSTICE TEST ON AVAILABLE VALUE WAITING CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED. CLIMATE RESILIENCE FUNDING ANALYSIS FOUND THAT MILLIONS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS WILL BE LEFT BEHIND UNDER THE PLAN THE LEGISLATURE WAS CURRENTLY PURSUING- SO LET'S START WITH THE GENDER IMPACTS OF THAT. I AM WITH ITS FOCUS ON TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE ON AND A LACK OF FUNDING FOR MORE GENDER BALANCED- SHIELD SUCH JUST PUBLIC HEALTH. WE FOUND THAT 92% OF THE JOBS LIKELY TO BE CREATED HI. THE COMPLIMENT RESILIENCE BONDS WOULD GET A DEMAND WHILE ONLY 8% OF THE JOBS WERE PROJECTED TO GO TO WOMEN. ON THIS WASN'T THE ONLY STRIKING GENDER INEQUITY IN- THE PROPOSED FUNDING. THE TWO REGIONS THAT GET THE MOST PER CAPITA FUNDING- THE NORTH COAST REGIONS IN THE SIERRA NEVADA REGENTS ARE MAJORITY MAN THE TWO REGIONS THAT GET THE LEAST FUNDING ARE MAJORITY WOMEN ON THESE GENDER DIFFERENCES ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN TERMS OF GREETING THIS MAP WHICH WILL FOLLOW ON THAT SIDE- ON THE NEXT SIDE AS WELL THE BLACK DOTS ARE POPULATION DENSITY ET DARK GREEN IT'S THE MOST FUNDING- PER CAPITA IN CLIMATE AND- RESILIENCE INVESTMENTS AND YELLOW IS THE LEAST. SO THIS GETS TO THE HEART OF OUR ANALYSIS THE PROJECTION OF THE IN THE BEST HANDS BY REGIONS AS- AS REFLECTED IN THE TWO CLIMATE RESILIENCE FARMS- EIGHTY FIFTEEN HUNDRED IN SP FORTY FIVE ARE NOW LISTS THE SPECIFIC ANALYSIS. THE NUMBERS HERE ARE CRAZY FIFTEEN HUNDRED- BUT THE TWO- BARNES HAD SIMILAR RESULTS. LET ME TALK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT OUR METHODS BASICALLY OUR DATA SCIENTISTS CREATED MERGED AND AGGREGATED INFORMATION FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES TO PRODUCE DETAILED DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS FOR EACH OF THE NINE REGIONS IDENTIFIED IN CALIFORNIA'S FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ASSESSMENT- AT THE SAME TIME WE ANALYZED THE PROJECTS AND FUNDING- IN THE SEVERAL DOZEN- PROJECTS ARE. LISTED IN THE TWO BARNS ON AND WE BROUGHT THESE TWO DATASETS TOGETHER TO DETERMINE WHAT- MARIUS WAYS OF LOOKING AT THE FUNDING- FOR THE REGIONS- AS YOU CAN SEE THE NORTH COAST REGION- IS PROJECTED TO RECEIVE ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. IN FUNDING PER CAPITA VERSUS THE LOS ANGELES REGION WHERE 45% OF STATE LIVES- IT'S PROJECTED TO RECEIVE ONLY EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS PER CAPITA- THAT SH- MULTIPLE LARGE NORTH BECAUSE IT'S A MULTIPLE OF THIRTEEN TIMES WHAT THE LOS ANGELES REGION- AND JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT THESE MAPS AND THE TABLE CAN BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE AT THE GET THE- DOT ORG WHERE THE REPORT IS POSTED. THIS REGIONAL FUNDING IMBALANCE LEADS TO MASSIVE RACIAL INEQUALITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF PARKER- AS WE CAN SEE FROM THIS MAP WHERE BY PA CALIFORNIANS. ARE CONCENTRATED IN REGIONS THAT RECEIVE. THE LEAST FUNDING AND LESSEN THEIR FAIR WHICH ARE CURRENTLY. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DID THIS HAPPEN. THIS IS A MAP OF POPULATION DENSITY IN CALICO YEAH AND IT'S ESSENTIALLY A MIRROR IMAGE OF WHERE THE INVESTMENT- ARE GOING. BASICALLY WITH THE MESSAGE HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD WILDFIRE PREVENTION NOT- THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF SMOKE. AND HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD SEA LEVEL RISE AND EXTREME HEAT IMPACTS RELATIVELY NEGLECTED IN THE BILLS URBAN AREAS AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE SHORT CHANGED. SO THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THIS IS NOT SET IN STONE AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE- ON THE FORMULAS AND ADVANCED EQUITY HI SO WE HAVE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS- FOR THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE- MOST- OBVIOUSLY AND SIMPLY IS. DEDICATING MORE FUNDING FOR EXTREME HEAT WE'LL- TAKE CARE IT WILL HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE MOST DEADLY IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CHANGE- INVESTING COOLING SOLUTIONS PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER PROTECTIONS PARTICULARLY FOR OUTDOOR WORKERS AND WAREHOUSE WORKERS. WILL SHAPE LIVES AND ADVANCE EQUITY AT THE SAME TIME. I HATE ALL OF THE GREEN JOBS FOR WOMEN AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING A MULTI TIERED APPROACH SOME- TEXAS ARE SIMPLE LIKE DEDICATING MORE MONEY TO PUBLIC HEALTH WHERE THE WORKFORCE IS MORE BALANCE WILL TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THIS. BUT FOR TRADITIONALLY MALE DOMINATED OCCUPATIONS IN CONSTRUCTION AND FIRE FIGHTING- CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO GET CREATIVE- CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXPLORE WAYS TO LEVERAGE STATE INVESTMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE JOB CREATION FOR WOMEN. ON THE BUDGETS SURPLUS PRESENTS A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE LIVES AND IF FANS EQUITY AND I WANT TO- ON. I'M GOING TO STRUCTURE MUCH SCREEN AT THE MOMENT. I'M I WANT IT AND- ON THE POINT THAT ALL OF THE YOU HAVE MADE SO ELOQUENTLY CLIMATE CHANGE IS HERE ON BUT THIS IS A UNIQUE MOMENT THE BUDGET SURPLUS IS IN A SENSE A GIFT TO THE STATE. AND YOU SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER LITERALLY TO SAVE LIVES YOU HAVE BEEN IN YOUR POWER TO MAKE CALIFORNIA LIVABLE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS SO IN CLOSING THING I WOULD ENCOURAGE. AND IMPLORE YOU TO SEE IF THIS STORAGE OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE A CLIMATE RESILIENCE PLAN THAT IS MORE BALANCED EQUITABLE AND FAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COHEN- WILL COME BACK TO YOU AT THE END OF THIS PANEL FOR QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE MEMBERS BUT NEXT WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PROFESSOR ALEX HALL. AT THE DEPARTMENT OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES HE'S ALSO DIRECTOR OF THE UCLA CENTER FOR CLIMATE SCIENCE- DOCTOR HALL IF YOU ARE WITH US. YOU CAN TAKE IT AWAY. ALL RIGHT YES I AM HERE- I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO PRESENT TODAY I HAVE BEEN DOING CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION RESEARCH FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE NOW. AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE LENS OF MEGA FIRES IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN MEGA FIRES- OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS OR SO- WITH BIG INCREASES IN AREA BURNED AND REALLY DRAMATIC CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEMS AND PUBLIC HEALTH- AND IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THESE FIRES HAVE OCCURRED- THIS IS A MAP SHOWING DISTRIBUTION OF FIRES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES. THEY'VE BEEN PRIMARILY IN OUR WILD LANDS AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT- AND IF YOU COMPARE THIS MAP TO OUR- MAP OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY- ON THE LEFT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE ARE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE TWO MAPS THE- MOST SOCIAL VULNERABILITY IS IN OUR URBAN AREAS AND OUR FIRES ARE OCCURRING IN OUR WILD LANDS. SO YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU SUPPOSE THESE MAPS THAT- THERE WOULDN'T BE A LOT OF VULNERABILITY- FROM WILDFIRE AMONG HER FLORAL POPULATIONS BUT OF COURSE WE AND IT'S NOT TRUE AS- MISTER WALLACE WELLS POINTED OUT- WE HAVE THIS REALLY DRAMATIC IMPACT OF WILDFIRE ON AIR QUALITY INSTANT IMAGE OF SAN FRANCISCO- IN- LAST SEPTEMBER WHEN WE HAD A SERIES. OF MEGA FIRES IN CALIFORNIA. SO- THE QUESTION THAT ARISES YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE DO BETTER WITH REGARD TO- UP PREVENTING MEGA FIRES- AND ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS IN- ESPECIALLY IN FORESTED AREAS NOT SO MUCH- CHAPARRAL REGIONS BUT IN THE FOREST IS TO DO PRESCRIBED. BURNING AND THE IDEA BEHIND PRESCRIBED BURNING IS THAT WE CAN REDUCE FUEL LOADS WE CAN RESTORE A FIRE SCENE THAT'S CLOSER TO WHAT IS NATURAL AND IN THE FORESTED AREAS- AND WE CAN THEN PREVENT SUBSEQUENT MEGA FIRES- DOWN DOWN THE ROAD. NOW THE DRAWBACK OF PRESCRIBED FIRES IT IS THAT THEY PRODUCE LOCAL EMISSIONS AND THEY DO IMPAIR QUALITY WHERE THEY OCCUR. BUT THE GOAL IS TO THEN PREVENT THESE DRAMATIC REGIONAL EMISSIONS- AND EVEN CONTINENTAL SCALE EMISSIONS WHEN WE HAVE. THESE BIG MEGA FIRES SO THIS RAISES A VERY THORNY POLICY QUESTION- WHICH IS WHO GETS SMOKE FROM FIRE- DO WE HAVE LOW LOW TO MEDIUM INTENSITY FIRES THAT PRODUCE LOCAL MISSIONS- LIKE THEY ARE PRESCRIBED FIRE CASE OR DO WE- HAVE THESE GIANT EMISSIONS FROM THESE MEGA FIRES THAT CAN. IMPACT MANY COMMUNITIES INCLUDING OUR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN URBAN AREAS. SO TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION RIGOROUSLY- WE NEED QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS- AND SO WE NEED TO BE DEVELOPING POLICIES THAT ARE AROUND SAFE PRESCRIBING- BURNS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE SO WE NEED TO QUANTIFY THE BENEFITS OF STRATEGIES LIKE PRESCRIBED BURNS ON FIRE RISK. AND AIR QUALITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE NEED TO BE FOCUSING OF COURSE ON THE BENEFITS TO VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PRESCRIBED BURNS OCCUR- AND THIS IS I THINK A VERY DELICATE BALANCING ACT AND WE REALLY NEED THE BEST SCIENCE TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS. AND FINALLY WE HAVE TO DEVELOP THIS UNDERSTANDING IN THE CONTEXT OF A CHANGING CLIMATE WHERE UNFORTUNATELY MEGA FIRES BECOME LARGER AS TEMPERATURES INCREASE. SO HOW DO WE DEVELOP THIS QUANTITATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS OF STRATEGIES LIKE PRESCRIBED BURNING. WHAT WE NEED EXTRA CHEESE AND A DEEP COLLABORATION FROM A NUMBER OF AREAS AND I'VE LISTED THESE HERE- YOU'LL NOTE THAT THESE ARE REALLY DESPERATE AREAS THESE ARE EXPERTS THAT I CAN TELL YOU ARE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO WORKING. WITH ONE ANOTHER- AND SO WE HAVE TO FOSTER THIS TYPE OF- DEEP ENGAGEMENT ACROSS FROM WIDE VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES- AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES- TO- TRY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES SO I'M I'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN JUST A MOMENT. SO SPOKEN TO YOU ABOUT A FEW SUBTLE NEEDS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WILDFIRE AND EQUITY- I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR CLEAN AIR FOR HEALTHY POPULATIONS AND THE NEED TO. BRING EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK. AND MANAGE AIR QUALITY. BUT IF WE ZOOM OUT AND THINK MORE BROADLY ABOUT WILDFIRE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO WILDFIRE WE HAVE MANY SOCIETAL NEEDS IN ADDITION TO THE ONES ASSOCIATED WITH AIR QUALITY AND I'LL JUST LET YOU ABSORB THESE ADS- I ALLOW THEM TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN HERE. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE ISSUES INVOLVES A VERY WIDE VARIETY OF DISCIPLINES AND COLLABORATION- BETWEEN THE RESEARCHER COMMUNITY AND THE STAKEHOLDER AND GOVERNMENT COMMUNITIES. SO WE NEED SUSTAINED AND DEEP COLLABORATION TO REALLY ADDRESS HOLISTICALLY. THE WILDFIRE ISSUE. IN THE PAST YEAR SO I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH- COLLEAGUES AROUND THE STATE THANK YOU VERY AN IDEA FOR A CLIMATE AND WILDFIRE INSTITUTE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THIS TYPE OF CROSS DISCIPLINARY AND CROSS SECTORAL ENGAGEMENT- AND I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE QUEUE AND I IF IT COMES UP- BUT- I WOULDN'T WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS MESSAGE- WHICH IS THAT WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION RELATED TO. WILDFIRE OR THE OTHER VERY PRESSING ISSUE OF WATER RESOURCES OR SINGLE ARISE- OR- EXTREME HEAT AND MANY OTHER ISSUES. ALL THESE INVOLVING INVOLVE PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND THEY ALL REQUIRE. DEEP AND SUSTAINED CROSS DISCIPLINARY AND CROSS SECTOR ENGAGEMENT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY WE JUST ARE NOT DOING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF ONE OFF PROJECTS- THAT JUST DON'T. JUST DON'T- ADDRESS THESE ISUES IN A VERY DEEP WAY TO HELP THE EXAMPLE OF. ON AIR QUALITY AND WILDFIRE ILLUSTRATES THIS. POINT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DOCTOR ON ON I'M SURE WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU WITH QUESTIONS- BUT BEFORE WE DO LET'S LET'S. INTRODUCE OUR FINAL PANELIST FOR THIS FIRST PANEL OF EXPERTS. SIR MICHAEL WHERE- THE STANFORD WOODS INSTITUTE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WHO IS- THE DIRECTOR OF THE CLIMATE AND ENERGY POLICY PROGRAM. AND A FREQUENT CONTRIBUTOR TO POLICY MAKING EFFORTS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY MR WHERE- PLEASE PROCEED. THANKS FOR HAVING ME FOR THE HEARING I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVITATION- FROM THE COMMITTEE. AND FROM YOU SENATOR STROM- I JUST ALSO NOTE- THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY- ARE MY OWN AND DON'T REFLECT MY EMPLOYER FOR. THE CALIFORNIA- CATASTROPHE RESPONSE COUNCIL- ON WHICH I SERVE ON. SO I WOULD JUST SECONDS- OR THIRD MAYBE OR FORCE I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FOR LOST COUNT AT THAT POINT IT'S BEEN MADE REPEATEDLY THAT- CLIMATE CHANGE COSTS AND IMPACTS OR HERE. NOW AND- THE- THEY ARE PRESENT IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY AND CALIFORNIA. AND THE COSTS AND THE IMPACTS ARE GROWING AND LIKELY TO GROW THREE TIME AS WE AS AS AS THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCREASED BECAUSE- OF OUR- FAILURE OR INABILITY TO. CEASE EMITTING GREENHOUSE GASES INTO OUR ATMOSPHERE- OF COURSE AS WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH- FINANCIAL CRISES THROUGH THE IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC- THE TOTAL COST ISN'T ALWAYS WHAT MATTERS AS MUCH AS HOW IT IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS SOCIETY AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE OBSERVING IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROBLEM F WILDFIRE. IS THAT THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE EXTREMELY UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S FORTY MILLION CITIZENS AND- AND THEN WE CAN DO MORE TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND TO HELP THEM LIVE AND THRIVE IN THE STATES AS WE CONTINUE TO FACE THIS GROWING CHALLENGE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. I JUST WANNA GIVE THREE EXAMPLES OF HOW CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ARE UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED TO FRAME- SOME SUGGESTIONS THAT WILL FOLLOW ONE IS NEXT- THE EXPERIENCE OF RENTERS AFTER A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES- WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF REALLY REALLY TRACK TRAUMATIC AND I AND CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN THE STATE OF THE SOUTH AND THE NORTH- OVER THE LAST. FOUR YEARS- SHOULD BE CLEAN WHAT OCCURS AND WE HEARD ABOUT THE SIDEWALL TECHNICIAN IN SPADES FROM FIRE VICTIMS WHO CAME AND TOOK TIME TO TESTIFY AND EXPLAIN TO US HOW THEY HAD EXPERIENCED WILDFIRE TYPICALLY WHAT OCCURS AFTER A MAJOR WILDFIRE IS THAT HOMEOWNERS WHO HAVE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE RECEIVE THE BENEFIT OF A GUARANTEED- RENTAL REIMBURSEMENT FROM THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY. AND THE IMPACT OF THAT IN A COMMUNITY THAT LOOP LOSES A MAJOR CHUNK OF HOUSING IS TO BID UP THE COST OF RENTAL HOUSING TYPICALLY RESULTING IN THE ADDITION OF MANY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RENTERS IN THE COMMUNITY THIS HAPPENED IN CINEMA COUNTY AND NAPA COUNTY AFTER TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT HAPPENED IN THE CHICO AREA AFTER THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CAMPFIRE. THAT IN TURN. IT IS. AN ALREADY PRESSING HOUSING CRISIS FOR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA AND IN THE CASE OF CHICO HAS GENERATED REALLY AN UNPRECEDENTED. HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IT'S REALLY TRANSFORMED THE POLITICS OF THE REGION AND- HAS HAS LED TO JUST REALLY AND NO ENORMOUS NUMBERS. OF RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNSHELTERED AND THAT ARE- TRULY IN IN THE MOST BRUTAL SENSE CLIMATE REFUGEES. ANOTHER IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES THAT IS- DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA IS THE ONE IS THE IMPACT OF OFFER SMOKE WHICH SPENDS CAST AT SOME LENGTH. I WON'T GO INTO TOO MUCH MORE DETAIL EXCEPT TO NOTE THAT. IT'S TYPICALLY THE CASE THAT OLDER HOUSING STOCK WHICH IS THE HOUSING STOCK THAT LOW AND MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TEND TO LIVE IT. IS LESS WELL INSULATED FROM SMOKE AND SMOKE IMPACTS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT DURING SMOKE EVENTS. WEALTHY RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA CAN RETREAT INDOORS CAN AFFORD THE PURCHASE OF- YOU KNOW HAVE A GREAT AIR FILTERS FOR THEIR HOMES AND CAN LIVE IN RELATIVE SAFETY WHEREAS LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS TYPICALLY IN RENTAL HOUSING. THAT HAS THIS HAS NOT NOT AS TIGHT SEALS ON DOORS AND WINDOWS. ARE SUBJECT TO INDOOR AIR QUALITY NEEDS JUST AS BAD AS THE OUTER ALL YOU REALLY HAVE NO SAFE PLACE TO GO. A THIRD IMPACT- THAT I THINK IS REALLY RELEVANT AND CONNECTS THE WILDFIRE ISSUE TO THE HEAT ISSUES THAT WERE WERE FACING CHALLENGES FROM. IS THE IMPACT FOR LOW INCOME ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS OF RATE INCREASES DUE TO NEEDED WILDFIRE INVESTMENT. AND WE'RE SEEING A REALLY RAPID ACCELERATION IN THE RATE OF ELECTRICITY RATE INCREASES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE NEED TO INVEST IN PRE HARDENING AND GREATER WEALTH FOR SAFETY. BACK AGAIN DESPITE FAIR AND CARE RATES WHICH MOST LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO IS A LEADING TO ACCELERATION AND COST OF. ENERGY FOR THESE CUSTOMERS AND THAT COMPROMISES THEIR ABILITY ON THE HOTTEST SUMMER DAYS TO RUN THE AIR CONDITIONER TO KEEP YOUR HOME COMFORTABLE ASSUMING THEY HAVE AIR CONDITIONER- AND SO IT'S CREATING A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT. THAT THEN ONCE AGAIN IS BORNE BY THOSE LEAST ABLE LEAST ABLE TO MANAGE IT OR FOR IT- SO. RESPONSES TO CLIMATE CHANGE URGENTLY NEED TO FOCUS ON REDUCING OVERALL SOCIETAL RISK- PROFESSOR HALL DISCUSSED THE NEED TO USE MORE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN IN OUR FORESTS TO GET GOOD FIRE BACK ON THE GROUND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT WE ALSO NEED TO REALLY FOCUS ON INCREASING THE RESILIENCE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND I JUST SUGGEST THREE THREE IDEAS OR CONCEPTS THAT THAT HAVE BEEN- SUGGESTED OR TRIED TO DETER WORTH SIX MORE SERIOUSLY ONE IS ONE ONE IS A PROPOSAL THAT WAS CONTAINED IN A WELFARE COMMISSION REPORTS THAT THE COMMISSION ISSUED- SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IT SUGGESTED THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONSIDER SOME SORT OF AN AUTOMATIC CATASTROPHIC INSURANCE PAY OUT FOR THOSE WHO LACK OTHER COVERAGE AND ART AND ART AND ART. HARMS LOSE THEIR HOME. AS A FUNCTION OF THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE. MANY RENTERS LACK RENTERS COVERAGE MANY LACKS IN CERTAINLY THEY DON'T HAVE HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE IF THEY DON'T OWN A HOME. AND THEY'RE AND THEY'RE SUBJECT TO REALLY DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS BECAUSE OF THEIR OVERALL FINANCIAL VULNERABILITY WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. ANOTHER BUT I WOULD COMMENCE TO SORT OF BROADER APPLICATION IS WHAT THE CURRENT TRIBE IS DOING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN MANAGE THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE AND A VERY ACTIVE. CULTURAL BURNING AND PRESCRIBED FIRE PROGRAM. THEY HAVE A LENDING LIBRARY OF HEALTH CONSULTORES BUT THE LOAN AMOUNTS TO TRIBAL ELDERS IN ADVANCE OF PRESCRIBED FIRE AND WHENEVER THERE IS A WILDFIRE NEARBY THAT MAY CAUSE SMOKE IMPACTS. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING IN THOSE TERMS ABOUT REDUCING EXPOSURE WHEN WE CANNOT PREVENT ADMISSIONS FOR THE BONE LEVEL IN OUR COMMUNITIES- A SECOND STEPINAC PAIN IT IS ALSO YOU KNOW KIND OF. MENTIONED IN PASSING- EARLIER IN THE HEARING IS A CONSIDERATION OF SCHOOL RETROFITS- BOTH TO IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY FOR STUDENTS IN LOWER AIR QUALITY REGION SUCH AS THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN. COUNTY VALLEY- DURING PRE COULD WHEN AIR QUALITY IS ALREADY. OFTEN AGAIN AND NON ATTAINMENT WITH THE CLEAN AIR ACT BUT ALSO TO ENSURE THAT DURING SMOKE EVENTS. KIDS HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SPEND TIME AT LEAST FOR EIGHT HOURS A DAY WHEN THEY ARE IN SCHOOL. I'M IN A COURSE THEY ARE GENERALLY IN SCHOOL DURING SEPTEMBER OCTOBER WHEN- THIS SMOKE IS MOST LIKELY TO BE PARTICULARLY INTENSE. AT THE LARGEST SCALE WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN CLEAN AIR. IT IS HEALTHY TO BREEZE HANDS HAVE HOMES THAT ARE MODERN AND SAFE. SO THEY CAN BE MADE SAFE FROM WILDFIRE SMOKE. FROM EXTREME HEAT EVENTS AND FROM WHATEVER ELSE CLIMATE CHANGE THROWS AT US OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES THANK YOU VERY MUCH OBVIOUSLY QUESTIONS AFTER. THANK YOU PROFESSOR- WILL TURN BACK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS STRUCTURE. YES THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN I HAD A QUESTION FOR PROFESSOR HALL ARE YOU STILL THERE WE TALKED BRIEFLY ABOUT- PRESCRIBED BURNS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WE NEED TO DO TO BETTER MANAGE OUR FORCE OFFICE IN CALIFORNIA SERVER UNIQUE STATE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE LAND IS OWNED BY OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATELY OWNED AND THEN THE STATE OWNS- A PORTION OF IT AS WELL. SO ONE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER FOLKS- FEDERALLY AND PRIVATELY TO- ACCESS THESE THESE LANDS TO BURN ON THE CONTROL BURNS FOR ONE FOR TWO. ALMOST ZERO TAKE PROBABLY SEVERAL YEARS TO TRY TO CLEAR OUT AS MUCH. OF THAT- OF OUR OUR LAND AS POSSIBLE. WOULD YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW BY CHANCE HOW MANY ACRES YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK OUT. FOR PRESCRIBED BURNS A YEAR OF TILE I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS IT WOULD TAKE TO. ADEQUATELY CONTROL ON OUR ON OUR STATE LANDS- ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT. YEAH I- I THINK THAT ON THE ISSUE OF COLLABORATION IS ONE THAT I HIGHLIGHTED- AND IT APPLIES- BUT YOU KNOW AMONG- THE LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AS WELL SO LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL- AND IN OUR- CONSORTIUM WE HAVE BEEN REACHING OUT TO FEDERAL SCIENTISTS- SO ONE ONE WAY TO APPROACH THIS AT THE FEDERAL AGENCY LEVELS TO INTERACT WITH THE SCIENTISTS AND GET THEM- BUT OF COURSE WE ALSO HAVE TO BUILD BUILD STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE AGENCY OFFICIALS- SO I THINK THAT THAT SAY. IT'S A MATTER OF RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND CREATING THE RESOURCES AND- THE FORUM TO ENGAGE- WHICH- YOU KNOW I KNOW WE DO A LOT OF THAT ALREADY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO MORE- I THINK THE ISSUE OF SCALE IS A CHALLENGE- IT'S- YOU KNOW ONE REASON WHY PRESCRIBED BURNING IS PROBABLY MORE EFFICIENT THAN JUST MECHANICAL REMOVAL OF FUELS- IT'S BECAUSE LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO DO IT SCALE- I DON'T KNOW IF OFF TOP OF MY HEAD- EXACTLY HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE. HOW MANY ACRES BUT ONE ONE THING THAT WE- COULD DO BETTER WITH IS- REALLY UNDERSTANDING THE DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES AND FUELS AND- UNDERSTANDING- STRATEGICALLY WHERE THE RESOURCES WOULD WOULD BE BEST APPLIED- TO- GET THE MAXIMUM REDUCTION IN RISK- AND THAT'S THE TYPE OF THAT'S AN AREA WHERE I THINK THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY CAN HELP. THANK YOU- REMEMBER THE QUESTIONS I'M I JUST HAD A I HAD. ONE QUESTION- I THINK GOING BACK TO MISS COLLINS TESTIMONY WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT WILDFIRES BUT I WANTED TO ZERO IN ON. ON THE HEALTH IMPACTS THERE AND- ESPECIALLY ON SMOKE I KNOW I'VE SEEN A COUPLE STUDIES. AS OF LATE- TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRE SMOKE ON. THE TERMBIRTHS- ON MATERNAL HEALTH. AND ALSO- ON ONG HEALTH FOR YOUNG CHILDREN I HAD READ IN THAT I THINK IS A STANFORD STUDY THAT- THAT THERE WILL BE EVEN FROM ONE WILDFIRE EVENT ALONE- PERMANENT LUNG DAMAGE DONE IN THE GENETIC CODE ACTUALLY OF A CHILD'S LONGS FROM THAT KIND OF EXPOSURE I'M I WAS HOPING YOU COULD TOUCH ON- PERHAPS THAT THAT ISSUE AND- AND- I'VE GOT A FOLLOW UP QUESTION THERE BUT- BUT REALLY ZEROING IN ON- ON WOMEN AND CHILDREN- ANY FURTHER INSIGHT THERE YOU COULD LEND. YES I AM- YES THERE'S MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT SHOW IT IMPACTS ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WHEN CHILDREN HELD ON AND THERE IS A RECENT STUDY ON THAT- MENTAL HEALTH- IMPACTS OF WILDFIRE SMOKE AND HEAT. I THINK I WOULD. KIND OF- TAKE A BIGGER- VIEW OF THIS AND TALK ABOUT THE WAY REALLY THE GENDER TODAY MISSION LABOR AND AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NOT SOCIETIES AND WOMEN ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE CARETAKING INSURING THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS SO THE BURDENS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHETHER IT'S EXTREME HEAT OR SMOKE IMPACTS FALL NOT ONLY ON WOMEN INDIVIDUALLY BUT IT FALLS ON THEM AS CARETAKERS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND I WANT TO CALL ATTENTION TO ONE THING I NOTED AS WE WERE DOING THE RESEARCH ON THIS- ON THESE SCALES AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND THAT IS BAD I'M SURE THEIR VARIOUS DEFINITIONS OF A VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- IN THE VARIOUS PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND POLICY DOCUMENTS FOR CALIFORNIA AND- USES TO DEVELOP POLICY- IN ONLY ONE OF THOSE- WAS GENDER. CAN WE CALL THAT SO I WOULD SAY KIND OF IN A OVER ARCING WAY WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE VULNERABLE BASED ON THEIR GENDER IN THE WAYS THAT. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PEOPLE BEING MORE VULNERABLE BASED ON THEIR RACE AND THEIR ETHNICITY AND INCOME LEVELS AND I THINK- IT'S INCUMBENT ON CALIFORNIA TO START THINKING ABOUT THAT INCORPORATING IT INTO PLANNING DOCUMENTS AND THERE'S NO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK DONE AROUND THE WORLD ON THE SPECIFIC- IMPACT. OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON RETURN SPECIFICALLY AND BY GENDER AND I THINK IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO UP ITS GAME ON THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU FOR THAT INSIDE IT WHAT ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT- EXTREME HEAT EVENTS HIDDEN IN THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT- THINK WOODLAND HILLS HAD THE HOTTEST DAY. IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY LAST YEAR AT A HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DEGREES- AS OPPOSED TO JUST- COUNTING ON TURNING UP OUR AIR CONDITIONING UNITS AND RELYING ON THAT AS A- AS A TOOL TO SOMEHOW- AIR CONDITIONER WAY THROUGH CLIMATE DISASTERS- BUT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. ABILITIES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT ARE YOU ACTUALLY PROPOSING THAT WE FIND SOLUTIONS THAT'LL TAKE DOWN THE AMBIENT. TEMPERATURE IN URBAN AREAS- SO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WITH THAT DEGREES COOLER AND HOW HOW WOULD YOU ACTUALLY DO THAT IS THERE A WAY TO ACTUALLY REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE- IN THESE HEAT ISLANDS. YES ABSOLUTELY THAT'S ABSOLUTELY WHAT- WE'RE RECOMMENDING THERE ARE NUMBER OF COOLING SOLUTIONS COOL PAVEMENTS COOL ROOFS- THERE. IS CREATING COOL PLAYGROUNDS ON SCHOOLS INSTEAD OF MEANS LIKE BAKING ASPHALT SURFACES THAT ARE ON PLAYGROUNDS AND FIELDS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE WHO WORK ON THEIR CELL CALL OUT KIND OF RESOLVED PARTICULARLY WHICH IS BEEN DOING A LOT OF THIS WORK AND POTENTIALS. THIS IS PERSONAL TO ME TOO MY DAUGHTER IS AN OUTDOOR WORKER- NEAR RIVERSIDE- LIVING AND YOU KNOW A RENTED APARTMENT WHERE THE AIR CONDITIONING. REGULARLY FAILS EVERY TIME THE TEMPERATURE GOES OVER NINETY DEGREES. I HAVEN'T YOU KNOW AND SHE AND HER SISTER HAD SENT TO ME. ARE WE GONNA BE ABLE TO HAVE CHILDREN. IT'S ARE YOU THE GOING TO DO LET'S. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. THAT OUR CHILDREN CAN SURVIVE IN THIS WORLD. I AM SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO ALL YOU CAN AT THIS MOMENT AND- THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND EFFECT IS ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING IMPACTS. OF CLIMATE CHANGE FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND THERE'S MANY MEASURES THAT WE CAN TAKE NOW TO MITIGATE AIR AND MAKE OUR CITIES LIVABLE. THANKS FOR THAT- ONE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR DOCTOR HALL- HOW HARD COULD IT GET I KNOW YOU'VE DONE. I KNOW YOU'VE DONE SOME ADVANCED MODELING AND GOTTEN THAT MODELING- MUCH MORE GRANULAR BUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS HERE. AND CERTAIN PARTS OF CALIFORNIA HOW HOT. COULD GET. MUCH YEAH- WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT- WARMING AND CHANGES IN EXTREME HEAT OVER THE COURSE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- AND BY MID CENTURY WE'RE PROJECTING- YOU KNOW UNDER A SCENARIO WHERE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT THE SAME RATE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN- IN OTHER WORDS THE WORLD DOES NOTHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE- WE'RE ANTICIPATING. A WARNING OF AN ADDITIONAL FOUR OR FIVE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY MID CENTURY IN ABOUT EIGHT. OR NINE DEGREES FAHRENHEIT BY THE END OF THE CENTURY ON AVERAGE AND- OF COURSE THAT MEANS THAT- EXTREME HEAT- BECOMES YOU KNOW THANK. ON AVERAGE MORE EXTREME BY THAT THAT DEGREE AS WELL SO- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT WAS A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN- DEGREE EXTREME EVENT BECOMES A MAN THEY JUST BECOME THAT MUCH MORE EXTREME. BY THAT BY THAT MEASURE SO- AND ALSO WE HAVE MANY MANY MORE EXTREME HEAT EVENTS UNDER THOSE UNDER THE SCENARIOS WITH THAT AMOUNT OFAVERAGE WARNING SO- JUST IN TERMS OF EXTREME HEAT YOU KNOW BY THAT MEASURE ALONE- THE IMPACTS ARE ARE GOING TO BE. PRETTY DRAMATIC AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE ARE ALREADY BEING FELT. SO IN THEORY WE COULD BREAK A HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES. IN CERTAIN URBAN AREA I MEAN IF WE'RE ALREADY AT ONE TWENTY ONE ONE TWENTY TWO. GOOD I SEE IN THE HEART OF CANOGA PARK. IN A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY. THE HEART OF LA HIT A HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES. YEAH I THINK IF YOU COMBINE THAT WITH- WITH- THE URBAN HEAT ISLAND WHICH HAS BEEN NOTED- AND MAYBE WITH THAT WITH THAT ABSENCE OF STRATEGIES TO- REDUCE URBAN HEAT- LIKE THE ONES THAT THE DOCTOR CONNED MENTIONED- I THINK THAT- YOU COULD SEE TEMPERATURES AT HIGH. OKAY THAT'S- VERY SCARY- LET'S BUT LET ME JUST WRAP UP ONE ONE LAST QUESTION FOR. FRANCE OR WHERE- YOU TALKED ABOUT- WHAT THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING ABOUT- WILDFIRE SMOKE- AND DISASTER RISK ITSELF YEAH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING BEYOND THE SCOPE OF IT THAT THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD CAN TACKLE IS THAT DOES THIS MEAN NEED MORE THAN JUST THE AIR QUALITY APPROACH TO THE ISSUE. WELL I THINK THE. A. R. B. IS WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND WITH CALLOW YES TO TRY TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY AND YOU SEE THIS IN THE JANUARY REPORT FROM DATA FOREST MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE I THINK WE'RE WE'RE ALL WORKING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND- SOME OF THE ISSUES SAID. THAT ALEX HALL MENTIONED- PROFESSOR ALL MENTIONED WITH RESPECT TO BALANCING PRESCRIBED FIRE SMOKE AND WILDFIRE SMOKE AND HOW TO HOW TO THINK THROUGH THAT TRADE OFTEN COST BENEFIT TRADEOFF THAT SUPPLIED BY IT- I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE. REALLY LOOKING BOTH AT THE ADMISSIONS SIDE REDUCING EMISSIONS AS WE AS MUCH AS WE CAN OF WILDFIRE SMOKE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT DRIFTS OVER HIGHLY POPULATED AREAS. AND ALSO TAKING STEPS TO REDUCE EXPOSURE- MAKING SURE THAT THE HONORABLE POPULATIONS PREGNANT WOMEN. KIDS OLDER PEOPLE. OUTDOOR WORKERS HAVE ACCESS TO P. P. HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE INDOOR SPACES WHERE THEY CAN BREEZE AND NOT WORRY THAT THEIR LIVES ARE BEING EXPOSED TO HARMFUL LEVELS OF PARTICULATES. AND THAT'S REALLY NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HAD TO DO AS FROM AN AIR REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE AS MUCH IN CALIFORNIA- GENERALLY FOCUSED ON CLEANING UP SMOKESTACKS AND TAILPIPES. AND WE'RE ENTERING A NEW ERA WHERE YOU KNOW THE FOREST IS NOT A SMOKESTACK OR TAIL PIPE YOU CAN STICK A SCRUBBER ON. AND SO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO REALLY RETHINK SOME OF THESE APPROACHES AND I MY SENSE IS THAT A RP IS REALLY IS REALLY DOING THIS AND BEGINNING TO DO IT. AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THE GOOD WORK IN THE SCIENCE AND THEN ALSO THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD THE SOLUTIONS CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON THEM. AND SO WE PROTECT ALL CALIFORNIANS. AS WE MOVE INTO THIS NEW ERA. THANKS FOR THAT- ONE OF MY BIG TAKEAWAYS I THNK FROM THIS PANEL IS THAT A LOT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT YOU'VE BEEN MENTIONING STOCKPILES OF PP- AIDS TO RESPIRATORY HEALTH. A PLACE OF REFUGE IMPROVEMENTS THERE LOCAL AIR QUALITY- SAME. RESPIRATORY PROTECTIONS ARE A LOT OF THE SAME INVESTMENTS WERE HOPING TO MAKE. TO PREVENT THE NEXT COVERED PANDEMIC RELEASED THE IMPACTS THERE- SO- WE MAY BE ABLE TO. FIGHT TO CRISES AT ONCE IN THAT REGARD. I'M WE'RE GONNA WRAP UP THIS PANEL IS THERE ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS HERE- ALONE WILL MOVE ON TO TAKE A- MORE GRANULAR. AND HUMAN LOOK BEYOND JUST THE SCIENCE AND THE REPORTS AND SOME OF THE GAPS IN OUR- OUR WORK TO REALLY LOOK AT. WHAT LIFE ON THE GROUND IS LIKE WITHIN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND TO START TO IDENTIFY. WHAT WHAT MAKES UP A VULNERABLE POPULATION AND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE- I WANT TO WELCOME FIRST- AMY RECALL. FROM THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK. WHO'S ALSO HERE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. SOI WELCOME YOU AMY AND THEN WE'LL TURN TO OUR OTHER TWO PANELISTS. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR STERN. VICE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I'LL BE SPEAKING TO THE NEED FOR BUILDING COMMUNITY RESILIENCE TO CLIMATE DISASTERS- AND YET JUST THANK YOU FOR HAVING. SO I'M GRATEFUL TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK WHICH IS A GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH ASIAN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES IN THE BAY AREA. MANY OF WHOM ARE MONOLINGUAL AN ELDERLY AS WELL AS YOUTH LEADERS THAT WE SO I'LL WORK WITH. AND WE WORK ON A MULTITUDE OF CLIMATE JUSTICE ISSUES- AS MENTIONED ARE ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE- HERE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THE BROADER SET OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON TODAY WHETHER THAT BE FARMWORKER COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES. INDIGENOUS FOLKS- AND BROADLY WORKING CLASS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ACROSS THE STATE. AS CALIFORNIA IS BEING PUSHED TO EXTREMES WE HEAR SCIENTISTS SAY THAT THERE ISN'T A NORMAL ANYMORE. AND THAT WHEN YOU ADD THESE CRISES TOGETHER THE IMPACT IS CUMULATIVE. BUT FROM VIRAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYED WITH THE BURDEN OF OUR POLLUTING INDUSTRIES FOR GENERATIONS THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT CUMULATIVE HEALTH IMPACTS. THIS IS THE CASE IN RICHMOND WHERE WE ORGANIZE COMMUNITIES LIVING ON THE FENCE LINE OF THE CHEVRON REFINERY. FOR US THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS PERVASIVE MEANING IT IS FELT DAILY NOT JUST DURING TIMES OF DISASTER. THAT MEANS AIRPRINT POLLUTION CHRONICALLY THAT MEANS OIL SPILLS GLARING EXPLOSIONS AS WELL AS THE BROADER IMPACTS AND HEATLEY'S BLACKOUTS POWER SHUT OFFS AND WILD FIRE SMOKE ALONG WITH THE COMPLETE NINETEEN CONDEMNING. CONDITIONAL MODEL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HOWEVER ARE PROVING DEEPLY INADEQUATE. THEY'RE QUITE NICE WE NEEDED TO ENTITIES LIKE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS THEY RELY UPON PROTOCOLS LIKE EVACUATING TO FARAWAY SITES LIKE FAIRGROUNDS WE SHARE LYRICS IN ONE TO TWO LANGUAGES. VIED AN EMPTY SPACE WITHOUT TAILORED SERVICES THESE TYPES OF POLICIES ARE COLLECTIVELY SHUTTING OUT MANY MANY PEOPLE FROM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED INCLUDING THE FOLKS THAT WE ORGANIZE. HOWEVER THROUGH HISTORIC DISINVESTMENT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD TO BE INCREDIBLY RESILIENT WE ARE ORGANIZING FOR CHANGE AND INNOVATING LOCAL MODELS FOR CRISIS RESPONSE. WHEN DISASTERS STRIKE WE SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN COMMUNITIES COME TOGETHER PROTECTING EACH OTHER AND REBUILDING TOGETHER. IN SOME PLACES NEIGHBORS HAVE FOR MUTUAL AID NETWORKS TO SHARE THEIR RESOURCES SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN PROVIDING FOOD TO FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE PROVIDING ELECTRICITY ACCESS. HOWEVER WITHOUT PROPER INVESTMENT IN RESOURCES THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES CAN DO. APRONS RESILIENCE REPORT DISASTER REPORT PUBLISHED THIS NEED AND CALLS FOR TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO BOLSTER THE SOCIAL FABRIC IN SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT MEANS INVESTING IN THE SERVICES AND FACILITIES THAT ENSURE THAT PEOPLE AND NEIGHBORHOODS ARE QUICK TO RESPOND TO THE CONVERGING CRISES WE ARE EXPERIENCING AND SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE MEANS A VARIETY OF THESE TYPES OF EXAMPLES ARE. FACILITIES AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY SHOWING WHAT. ONE EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND A MODEL FOR A SOLUTION YOU WANT TO SEE SCALE. OUR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HOBBS THE TRANSFORMATION OF TRUSTED BUILDINGS LIKE LIBRARIES YOUTH AND SENIOR CENTERS FOR HEALTH CLINICS INTO FACILITIES THAT OFFER SPACE TO GATHER AND ACCESS SERVICES. NOT ONLY DURING TIMES OF CRISIS BUT ON A DAILY BASIS. THEY MAKE POSSIBLE THE SIMULTANEOUS INVESTMENT AND COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS SUCH AS IMPROVED INSULATION OR WEATHERIZATION WE'RE BUILDING TECHNOLOGY FOR COOLING AND HEATING BUT ALSO CLEAN ENERGY INSTALLATIONS FOR BACKUP POWER DURING GRID OUTAGES. AS WELL AS AIR FILTRATION SYSTEMS TO COMBAT WILDFIRE SMOKE. ONE EXAMPLE IS THE RISE YOUTH CENTER WHICH A PEN IS COLLABORATING WITH THE BECOMING USED TO LEAD TO RESILIENCE HUB WHICH ONCE COMPLETE WILL PROVIDE A SAFE AND TRUSTED SPACE FOR CLIMATE RESPONSE AS WELL AS EXPANDED COMMUNITY HEALTH AND YOUTH SERVICES. IMPORTANTLY THE CENTER IS THE GOAL BEYOND WHAT THEY'RE ONLY DEFINED COOLING CENTERS CAN PROVIDE BY OFFERING A SUITE OF INTEGRATED MEASURE. BEYOND CLIMATE RELIEF BUT ALSO DISTRIBUTION OF FOOD WATER AND EMERGENCY SUPPLIES INTERNET ACCESS AND CHILD CARE ALL LOCATED WITHIN COMMUNITY BUILDINGS PEOPLE TRUST AND ALREADY GATHER. I WANT TO LISTEN TO ADDITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES. THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES ILLUSTRATED ON THE LEFT FOCUSES ON BUILDING LONG TERM CATALYTIC INVESTMENTS FOR COMMUNITY SCALE TRANSFORMATION. IN CONTRAST TO THE IMMEDIATE TERM RELIEF THAT- RESILIENCE HUBS CAN OFFER TTC EMPOWERS THE COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY POLLUTION COULD CHOOSE THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOOD SCALE PROJECTS TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. THIS LOOKS LIKE MULTIPLE MULTIPLE INVEST- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS LIKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GREENING RENEWABLE ENERGY OR TRANSIT ALL DEPLOYED IN A COORDINATED WAY I CAN TRANSFORM COMMUNITIES INTO MODELS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC SUSTAINABILITY. AND LASTLY GROUPS LIKE A PEN LACK THE NECESSARY SKILLS STAFFING AND RESOURCES TO COMPETE FOR CRIME AT GRANT FUNDING AND SO TO SECURE FUNDING FOR THINGS- GRANTS LIKE RESILIENCE HUBS ARE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE COMMUNITIES WE NEED A LEVEL OF CAPACITY BUILDING COULD BE AT A POINT WHERE WE'RE READY TO APPLY. ON THE REGIONAL CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE CLIMATE COLLABORATIVE'S PROGRAM ALLOWS PARTNERS TO COME TOGETHER TO PLAN AND PREPARE PROJECTS FOR CLIMATE FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN TURN OUR COMMUNITY VISIONS INTO PROJECT READY TOTALS. AND SO THIS FINAL SLIDE SUMMARIZES THE SORT OF THREE KEY PROGRAMS I'VE UPLIFTED THAT CAN BE ENABLED RIGHT NOW IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- BISTRO PROGRAMS SOME OF WHICH ALREADY EXIST AND JUST NEED THE RESOURCES TO- REALLY DELIVER PROGRAM BENEFITS. AND THEY ARE THEY SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON OUR STATE'S MOST DISADVANTAGED AND VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND SO WE SEE THEM AS COMPLEMENTARY SOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY FUNDING. IN ORDER TO MEET THE DISTINCT NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITIES I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND OUR PARTNERS. TO ENABLE THIS VISION THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISERABLE- NEXT WE'LL TURN TO ASTRID WILLIAM WHO'S THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MANAGER FOR BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS. HI WELCOME MISS WILLIAMS TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR HAVING US IN BEING ABLE TO PRESENT ON THIS MATTER MS SCORING TO PRINT MY PRESENTATION TO SHARE WITH YOU ALL. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AND OTHER SENATE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM REPRESENTING BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS WE ARE AT A SMALL NONPROFIT. VERY MIGHTY ADVOCACY IN THERE AROUND THE HOUSE BLACK WOMEN ISSUES AND SO I IN THAT ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH MANAGER OVERSEEING THAT PROGRAM SISTERS IN CONTROL. JUST BRIEFLY TO LET YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE HEALTH ND WELL BEING OF BLACK WOMEN AND GIRLS THROUGH EDUCATION EMPOWERMENT AND ADVOCACY- BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS- SYSTEM CONTROL PROGRAM. AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF ADVOCACY IN THAT COMMUNITY NOT ONLY ARE LOCALLY IN THERE- SOUTH CENTRAL AREA. BUT I WOULD EVEN SAY STATEWIDE WE DO HAVE AN OFFICE LOCATED IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU CALL STARTS TO START THE VIDEO. CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN. YES WE GOT YOUR- IN. SEE YOU KNOW TWO THINGS YES I DON'T KNOW. YES WE'LL CONTINUE ON AND LET'S SEE. YEAH IT'S GREAT BUT BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS AS I MENTIONED WHERE- ADVOCACY AGENCY WE WORK TO BUILD HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES BY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES SUCH AS THE LIMITATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD OIL DRILLING- REDUCING OUR EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS THAT WE CAN FIND IN OUR PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS- CAN YOU NAME IT FROM SKIN CARE BEAUTY- HAIR CARE PRODUCTS AS WELL AS ADVOCATING ON THE BEHALF OF. CLIMATE CONTROL ISSUES. SO WHY IS THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT- IT'S NOT ONLY ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE BUT ALSO A RACIAL INJUSTICE AND SOME OF THE RACIAL DISPARITIES- THAT ARE AFFECTED. RELEVANT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO TOO MANY DAYS OF COLORS ARE MORE OFTEN SPACER AT THESE ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND I THINK THE PANELISTS BEFORE AS WELL AS- HOUSE SPEAKERS HAVE TOUCHED ON THIS- THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SOON SO WE FACED- ISSUES SUCH AS WATER AND AIR QUALITY POLLUTANTS- STORMS EVEN HEAT WAVES WHICH WAS TOUCHED ON AND THEN BALANCE NOW AMPLIFIED. DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT WE ARE IN FOR INSTANCE- POWER PLANTS AND OIL REFINERIES THAT WILL CRYING YOU KNOW LOCATED IN URBAN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS YOU KNOW- THROUGHOUT. YOU KNOW SOUTH LOS ANGELES WHERE YOU SEE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT AND ALSO THE REPRODUCTIVE AND NON- HARMS ARE AT THE HEART OF SETTING-PRODUCE TO REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEMS. AND THE- INFERTILITY THEY'D BE ABLE TO PRODUCE YOU. KNOW HEALTHY OUTCOMES FOR MATERNAL. COME LATER AND- AND TO PRODUCE A FAMILY. AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS WHERE IS IT THERE SITUATED THERE WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOCATED AND- BLACK URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS EXPOSING COMMUNITY COLOR. OR IT'LL QUALITY IN A HIGHER RISK OF DISEASE AND SOME OF CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCERS AS WELL SO THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TENDS TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSEN IMPORT NEIGHBORHOODS AND SO WHEN WE SAY FOUR NEIGHBORHOODS WERE LOOKING AFTER INCOME LEVELS OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND ACCESS. TO RESOURCES- SO FROM TOXIC WASTE AND- POLLUTED WATERS TO LITTER AND OTHER ELEMENTS ALSO NOT HAVING GREEN SPACE AND SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE A BUILT ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO EXERCISE GO OUT AND WALK HOW PARKS AND HAPPY IN A LARGE GREEN SPACE WHICH YOU CAN SEE. IN OTHER COMMUNITIES- BACKS ARE MORE AFFLUENT IN LOS ANGELES AND SO AIR POLLUTION IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS UNIQUE HIGH INEQUALITY ACROSS THE WORLD THIS SPECIFICALLY WERE LOOKING AT OUR AREA HERE IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES- WORDS FILLED. WITH THE NOW LARGELY WITH POLLUTANTS. IN A RECENT STAY EIGHT SHOWN COUPLE. THAT AVERAGE BLACK LATINO- READS ABOUT 40% MORE PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THAT EXHAUSTED HE LET'S SEE CARS TRUCKS BUSES. THERE ARE- COUNTERPARTS IN THE OTHER YOU KNOW- COMMUNITIES AND SO WHAT HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND A YEAR. PEOPLE WHO DON'T OWN HEARTS ARE SUFFERING FROM VEHICLE POLLUTION LEVELS ABOUT 20% HIGHER THAN THE STATE AVERAGE. AND SO WATER SINCE AS I MENTIONED IT'S AN APARTMENT ALL ON ISSUE AS WELL AND SO IT'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM. FORM A SYSTEMIC RACISM WHEREBY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED WITH HEALTH HAZARDS YOU NAME IT SO BREAST CANCER UTERINECANCER ASTHMA- AND CERTAIN TYPES OF. AS WE SAY IN LIFESTYLE- DISEASES LINKED TO WHERE WE LIVE WORK AND PLAY AND SOME OF THESE PRACTICES THAT FORCE THEM TO LIVE IN PROXIMITY TO SOURCES OF TOXIC WASTE IN LANDFILLS POWER STATIONS- MAJOR ROSIE MENTORS AND AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER IN SOME LA ACTUALLY KNOWS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AS WELL AS SOME OF THESE OIL REFINERIES. TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT OTHER RESIDENTS AND SELLING SAMPLES CAN BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR LIKES TRACTION THROUGHOUT SOUTHWEST SOUTHWEST ANGELUS WE HAVE A VERY RAPID CAMPAIGN WITH A LOCAL NONPROFIT CALLED STANTON SO TO STOP NEIGHBORHOOD OIL DRILLING. AS A RESULT THESE COMMUNITIES CAN SUFFER GREATER RATES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS AS WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW STATING SO HUNTED. BUT LABOR THE POINT OR LACKS. NO AT ALL BELIEVING I WOULD I WOULD DO ASK YOU WHAT BACK WITH. BUT IF YOU COULD JUST WRAP UP THE NEW TESTING HERE. SHE CAN DO WE CAN ADVOCATE- PROVIDE EDUCATION AWARENESS IN ON WHAT WE'RE HAVING HERE- ADVOCATING FOR BETTER POLICIES. SKEWS ME POLICIES PROTECTIONS- URGING ELECTED YOU KNOW ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THANK YOU MISS WILLIAMS AND WE MAY COME BACK TO YOU WITH WITH A LITTLE MORE DETAILED LOOK ON THE GROUND BUT SINCERELY APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN ALL YOUR ORGANIZING EFFORTS THUS FAR- THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- RETURN TO OUR LAST PANEL IS NOW ON THIS ON THIS PANEL- THAT'S MISS KRISTEN TOWARDS POLLING WHO IS THIS IS DEBBIE SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR FOR LA COUNTY- THE JUST PUT OUT THEIR SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WHICH TOOK A- PARTICULARLY POINTED LOOK AT SOMEBODY'S RACIAL AND OTHER EQUITY CHALLENGES TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS- STORES FALLING TO A- J. TESTIMONY WITH US. YOU MIGHT- GIVE IT GIVE A ONE. YEP YOU GOT IT NOW. ALL RIGHT I CAN DOUBLE I NEEDED THANK YOU CHAIR- AND THEN YOU DO THE COMMITTEE FOR INVITING THE COUNTY PARTICIPATE TODAY I'M KRISTIN TORRES CALLING AND MESSAGING ABILITY PROGRAM DIRECTOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HOUSTON BILLY OFFICE I ALSO SERVE ON THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS I'M AN INSURANCE. GROUP AS THE CHAIRMAN SHIN OUR OFFICE IS CHARGED WITH OVERSEEING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NATION'S MOST AMBITIOUS REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY PLAN WE CALL OUR COUNTY. ADOPTED BY OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN TWENTY NINETEEN IT'S A FINE DAY FOR YOU D'ANTONI COMPREHENSIVELY AND INCORPORATED. EQUITY AND RESILIENCE EVERY CAP. WELL I CAN'T EVEN CROWNED IN MANY WAYS OTHER ONE THAT WE ARE MOST PROUD OF WITH THE PURCHASE. EQUITY IN THE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT. WE SPENT A YEAR LISTENING TO A DIVERSE SET OF STAKEHOLDERS BEFORE WE EVER WRITE DOWN A WORD OF AND- DURING THAT PROCESS. A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE CENTRIC I'M ORIGINALLY DESPERATELY IMPORTANT LA COUNTY WHERE. SOME COMPS UNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED. HE RESPONDED DIRECTLY BY ESTABLISHING TARGET ENERGY HUMAN HEALTH. LIKE REDUCING 45% OF THE REGION. EACH STRESSED. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE IN CONVERTING THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE REGION'S HEAT TRAPPING. WELL DRINKER LIKE TWENTY THREE BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. THE OTHER JUST TWO OUT OF OVER FIFTY TARGETS THAT DEMONSTRATE OUR WILLINGNESS TO BE BOLD AND AMBITIOUS. I WILL NOTE THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A DEDICATED FUNDING STREAM HELP US FOR THE EIGHTY EIGHT. LA COUNTY YEAH. THE COUNTY LEADERSHIP WITH THOSE TARGETS. DESERVE RESOURCES FROM THE STATE TO HELP CATALYZE THE KIND OF CHANGE THAT WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THEY WANT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF CLIMATE RESILIENCE ACTION WE TAKE ON AFTER THE ADOPTION OF OUR PLAN WITH THE- THE KIND OF ON A REALLY. IT WAS ACTUALLY SO IMPORTANT TO ITS STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE WRITE IT DOWN TWICE- IN OUR PLAN. IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO YOU BOTH. OKAY SO- CREMONA ABILITY ASSESSMENT MEANING OUT OF FACTORS SOCIAL FACTORS LIKE INCOME AGE DISABILITY- AND HELD. A RACE AND ETHNICITY INFLUENCE CREDIBILITY. BUT ALSO PHYSICAL. HOW DOES OUR INFRASTRUCTURE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- DOES THAT. CHANGE WE ALSO LOOK. AT WHAT WE'RE CALLING CASCADING IMPACTS. WHAT ARE THE DOWNSTREAM RESULTS ON COMMUNITY FROM THE FIRST QUARTER IMPACT. WE DID THIS- COMPREHENSIVE CONNIE WHAT ASSESSMENT WITH OUR OWN COUNTY BUDGET IN ORDER TO SUPPORT. THE INCORPORATED CITY- TO COMPLETE THEIR STATE MANDATED SP THREE SEVENTY NINE APARTMENTS. TO UPDATE THEIR SAFETY ELEMENTS WITH. SO WE CREATED A CANDLE BUT I FOR THE RE DID YOU BETTER RESILIENCE PLANNING AND WE HOPE THAT THE STATE IS THAT A- IN COUNTY FOR COMING RESILIENCE OKAY I. DURING THIS PROCESS WE HEARD WITH ME WE HELP WITH ANY QUESTIONS WHAT'S WITH THE BIG POPULATIONS LIKE PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TRIBAL AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AND OUR WORKERS. WERE OFTEN LEFT OUT OF THE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS EVERY HEARD STORIES OF HOW PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS FILLED THE GAP. AND THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION OR WINDOWS INTERVENTIONS DID NOT SERVE THEIR PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT KIND OF COMMUNITY WITH THEM IS OUT THERE IT IS A MATTER OF TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN. LEADING COMMUNITY LEAD THE WAY IN PROVIDING RESOURCES. TO THOSE KIND OF LEADERS AND INNOVATORS. WELL WE NEED CERTAIN. NEW FINANCE RESOURCES. WE ALSO NEED THE COMMUNITY CENTER PURCHASE TO MAKE ANY NEW RESEARCH THAT WAS PART OF THE POSSIBLY CAN. ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE VULNERABLE. SIMPLY HAVING MONEY TO OPEN A COOLING CENTER REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH. WHEN PEOPLE DON'T DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE CALLING. YOU'RE A GOVERNMENT RUN COOLING CENTER BECAUSE THE MIGRATION STATUS. OR THEY CAN'T PHYSICALLY GET THERE BECAUSE THE TRANSPORTATION. NEED TO MAKE EXISTING INTERVENTIONS MORE EFFECTIVE. INTERVENTIONS AT COMMUNITY MEMBERS WATCHING ME. LIKE IT'S A BIT. ADDRESSING ONE POINT- WE EVEN MAKE CLEAR IN THE FORTHCOMING REPORT- IS THAT KIND OF UNDER THE LADY IS NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT IN HERE YES SIR. PEOPLE ARE POPULATION BUT THE STOMACH LIKE AN EQUITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACCESS TOP ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN YOUR LIFE I IT. WAS IN POLITICAL POWER ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ETCETERA. WELL OUR FINAL. HER FORTHCOMING- WE DO HAVE A GOOD TIME TO THE FINDINGS THIRTEEN EMERSON DESCRIBED HERE- WHAT ONE PARTICULARLY INTERESTING FINDING THAT A HIGHLIGHT IS THAT DURING CLIMATE EVENTS JUST LIKE WE WITNESSED DURING OPEN ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE ONCE AGAIN ESSENTIAL. NEED RESOURCES TO ENSURE THAT ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE ABLE TO EASILY DO THEIR JOB DURING. IN TURN. ALL COMMUNITY EIGHT GIVEN THESE FINDINGS AND GIVEN THAT WE ARE THE COUNTY THE HIGHEST SHARE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES STATE WORSENING INEQUALITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE YES THE GOVERNMENT WHETHER WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FUNDING FOR RESILIENCE HAVE BACKUP ENERGY AT CRITICAL. DO YOU OR EVEN YOU LADIES TO HELP. DEAL WITH THE NEW AND EXISTING DEVELOPMENT IN WILD PRONE AREAS ALL OF THE INTERVENTIONS BE IN COMMUNITY CONVERSELY REPORTER JUST FINE. IN TO HELP HOLD THE MARCH A MORE EQUITABLE FUTURE THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PROPERTY TO HELP US JACK YOUR- WE'RE TRYING TO DECIDE. WE URGE YOU TO. FIND THE KIND OF PEOPLE CENTRIC- TO CLIMATE DISASTER. THAT WE OUTLINED HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR PUTTING COUNTY IN HEARING BE HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- DECKING. THIS PANDA- ANY. FOLLOW UP FOR. YES JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR OUR THING FOR MUCH THE RESILIENCE POUNDS OF HAPPENING LA COUNTY. SO JUST SOMETHING I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE UPDATING THOSE PLANS RIGHT BECAUSE- SOMETIMES WILL COME UP WITH THESE GOOD PLANS TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUES AND THEN WE LEAVE IT THERE FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND WE DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL. SOMETHING HAPPENS WE GO BACK TO FOLLOW UP SOME REALLY BIG GOT UPDATING THESE PLANS ARE MAYBE LOOKING AT HIM EVERY YEAR JUST TO SEE. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE YEAR IN THE PAST TO KEEP UPDATING THEM TO ADDRESS ANY CHALLENGES THAT MAY COME ABOUT THAT WE PROBABLY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE BEGINNING. THAT'S ALL THANK YOU. YEAH THAT'S A GREAT POINT WE CERTAINLY NEED TO. CONTINUE TO. ENGAGE COMMUNITIES THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE THINK INVOLVED IS INVOLVED IN- UPDATING. THE LIST AND PEOPLE AND REFLECTS THEIR EXPERIENCE. AND I'LL JUST MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT- BEFORE. MOVING FORWARD I KNOW- ALL THREE PANELISTS TOUCHED ON IT AND IS A MEMBER ID OR CURRY NOTED AT THE OUTSET THAT PEOPLE CENTRIC APPROACH- SEEMS TO BE A OVERRIDING THEME HERE THAT LEADING RISK TO PEOPLE DRIVE- OUR PRIORITIES AND OUR FUNDING- NOT JUST IN FUNDING BUT ALSO IN POLICY. FOR THE STATE SEEMS CRUCIAL- SO THE MORE FEEDBACK WE CAN GET FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION'S GOING FORWARD AND HOW TO HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE FRAMEWORK AND REALLY PRIORITISE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FIRST- I THINK SHOULD BE ABLE TO AT LEAST START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE SYSTEMIC. OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM OR SYSTEMIC INEQUITY THAT YOU'VE BEEN TOUCHING ON I WOULD ALSO LIKE THIS THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE DIGGING IN FURTHER- AFTER THIS HEARING BUT HI TO BETTER MARY THE HAZARD MITIGATION WORK WE'RE DOING IN THE PRE HAZARD MITIGATION WORK WE'RE DOING- THROUGH FEMA OUR OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- WITH SOME OF THE WORK GOING ON IN THE SUSTAINABILITY SIDE- AND HOW TO ACTUALLY MARRY THOSE EFFORTS SO WE CAN BEST LEVERAGE. FEDERAL FUNDS BUT ALSO GET- BOTH THOSE WHO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES OPERATIONALIZED WITH THIS SORT OF DATA THAT YOU'RE PULLING OUT OF THESE EFFORTS SO I WILL BE LOOKING MORE CLOSELY AT THAT- I HAVE. PLENTY MORE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL- BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO KEEP OUR CHIEF PORTER WAITING SO- WHAT WE'LL WRAP THIS PANEL UP FOR NOW WE MAY COME BACK TO ALL WITH QUESTIONS- AS WE GO FORWARD BUT- I'M ACTUALLY I HAVE TO. IN ABOUT EIGHT MINUTES OR SO I HAVE TO TRADE THE GAVEL OVER TO MY VICE CHAIR HERE SO I'M BRIEFLY GOING TO KICK OFF- CHIEF PORTER INDIFFERENCE TO YOU START YOUR OWN TESTIMONY AND THEN AT SOME POINT DURING AFTER YOUR TESTIMONY TO PASS THE GAVEL OVER SO HELP YOU- CAN UNDERSTAND AND- DO RESPECT YOUR PRESENCE HERE TODAY I KNOW YOU'RE- VERY. BUSY RIGHT NOW. I'M TAKING ON I DON'TKNOW HOW MANY FIRES YOU GOT ON YOUR HANDS TODAY BUT FOR TAKING THE TIME WITH THIS COMMITTEE WE SINCERELY APPRECIATE. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU YEAH THERE IS A LOT OF FIRE ACTIVITY. FOR SURE GOING ON AGAIN THIS YEAR. BUT WE DO HAVE- PLENTY OF- LIGHTNING FIRES THAT ARE GOING TO BE POPPING UP OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS SO- NOT TO FLAG EVERYBODY TO THE CONCERNS THAT WE- LIVED THROUGH IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. BUT REMEMBER AUGUST OF LAST YEAR WE WERE RUNNING AT ABOUT A NORMAL KIND OF A YEAR. AND THAT THAT JUMPED. FROM AUGUST THROUGH DECEMBER TWO- ONE OF THE WORST YEARS THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN AND THE MOST NUMBER OF ACRES OF EVER BURNED IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU KNOW RECORD KEEPING. FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRES- OVER NINE THOUSAND BUYERS SO WILDFIRES. AND IHAD A STAGGERING 10005100% INCREASE OVER THE- TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- SEASON SO VERY ACTIVE YOU ALL KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN REFLECTED BY MANY OF THE SPEAKERS PREVIOUSLY. AND I JUST WANTED TO FLAG A COUPLE OF THOSE ITEMS JUST TO KEEP US- KIND OF LOOKING AT WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE ARE WHERE WE'RE GOING. FURTHER FORWARD- WE- ARE AT A PLACE WHERE WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BY AND LARGE- AN EIGHT INSTEAD OF ECOSYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE THAT ARE. FIRED ACTED- THEY HAVE BANNED MANAGED BY FIRE FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. BEFORE THE LAST SEVERAL HUNDRED YEARS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION HACKS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY THE LAST HUNDRED AND FIFTY. AND SO THERE IS AN INDIGENOUS- COMPONENT TO THIS AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES THAT NEED TO BE BROUGHT BACK INTO THE FOLD BROUGHT BACK INTO THE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ON THE ON THE LANDSCAPE AND WE NEED TO DO THAT IN A VERY- FORTHRIGHT WAY. AND AND MOVED ALL PROGRAMS IN THAT DIRECTION. WHAT IS ALSO CLEAR AND THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME HAVE HAVE INDICATED HEAT DROUGHT. WILDFIRE ANDALL OF THE ASPECTS THAT KIND OF. COMPASS BY THAT AND HOW THOSE ARE AFFECTING. ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND EVEN AS FAR AS AS NEW YORK CITY AS WE'VE HEARD THIS YEAR AND AGAIN AGAIN R. AND LAST YEAR- IT'S HAPPENING MORE FREQUENTLY. BUT IT'S HAPPENING- DISPROPORTIONATELY THESE EFFECTS TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND- BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TODAY I KNOW AND I WANTED YOU TO UNDERSTAND TOO THAT THAT IS PART OF- CAL FIRE'S PROCESS. CAL FIRE. DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION MYSELF AS THE STATE FORESTER FOR- THE STATE. ARE VERY MUCH LOOKING AT HOW DO WE CHANGE THIS AND HOW DO WE- DELIVER OUR PROGRAMS TO BEST SERVE. THE MOST VULNERABLE MIRACLE- POPULATIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. BUT ALSO- INSURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING A PRODUCT THAT CAN BE MIMICKED AND K. CARRIED. OUT FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME. SO OF THOSE THINGS WE'RE DOING- ARE- WE'VE WE HAVE- VERY DEEP PROGRAMS INCLUDING OUR FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAM- THAT IS JUST WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE IT THERE'S GRANT FUNDING RELATED TO THAT- WE UTILIZE- CALIFORNIA ENVIRO SCREEN FOR- FOR SOME OF OUR CRITERIA OF HOW WE DELIVER. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THAT ONE FOREST HEALTH- URBAN AND COMMUNITY FORESTRY YEAH THAT ONE GETS LESS ATTENTION BUT IS ALMOST MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LOT OF THE OTHERS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO- HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS AND- OUR URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO REDUCING THE HEAT ISLAND EFFECT BY PUTTING TREES BACK INTO URBAN AREAS. PUTTING SHADE IN URBAN AREAS REDUCING HE HEAT STRESS ON- COMMUNITIES THAT BY AND LARGE DON'T HAVE TREES IN THEM RIGHT NOW AND THAT PROGRAM IS HIGHLY DIRECTED TOWARD- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY OUT THE FUNDS OR THE CITIES THAT THEY ARE WITHIN HAVEN'T EXPENDED THE FUNDS TO PUT TREES INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES. TREES ARE THE ANSWER- FURTHER WEHAVE OUR CALIFORNIA FORCED IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOREST LEGACY PROGRAM THOSE ARE LOOKING AT THAT KIND OF THE FORESTED AREAS AND HELPING PEOPLE MANAGE THOSE FOR HEALTH AND- LONGEVITY- AND- AND IN MANY CASES ARE SEATED. CALIFORNIA FOR SOME GROUP OF PROGRAM IS GEARED TOWARD THOSE COMMUNITIES OR THOSE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO WANT TO DO THAT FOREST MANAGEMENT ON THEIR TEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY ACRES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO GET STARTED. SO THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT REALLY HELPS WITH THAT AND WILL REDUCE THE EFFECTS AND THE IMPACTS AND THE INTENSITY OF WILDFIRE ON ACRES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THAT'S WHERE WE'LL BE WORKING- IN THIS ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH FOREST MANAGEMENT THE URBAN WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE AREAS TO REDUCE THE INTENSITY OF FIRES IT COMES IN THE COMMUNITIES. HARDENING STRUCTURES OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE SO THAT STRUCTURES DON'T BURN IN WILDFIRES AND OVERALL REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF- EMISSIONS THAT COME FROM WILDFIRES. AND INCREASING YES IT WAS THEN DISCUSSED INCREASING A LITTLE BIT. THE PRESCRIBED FIRE. COMPONENT OF. THE EMISSION. BUT WE DO SMOKE MANAGEMENT PLANS FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE WE DIRECT SMOKE AWAY FROM. FROM THOSE AREAS SO WHAT YEAH I'M LIKE A WILDFIRE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK THE WEATHER THAT WE'RE GOING TO BURN UNDER AND BASS WORK HOW WE DIRECT WHERE. SMOKE GOES I CAN GUARANTEE IF WE PRESCRIBE IF WE DO ALL OF THE PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT WE WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE. NEW YORK CITY WILL NEVER SEE ANY IMPACT FROM THAT. GUARANTEED WITH ALL THIS- I DON'T WANT TO GO TOO LONG BECAUSE I KNOW YOU HAVE QUESTIONS- AFTER THE PANEL AND I HAVE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS- THAT ARE A PART OF THIS- WE JUST I JUST WANT YOU KNOW CAL FIRE IS LOOKING AT ALL SEGMENTS WERE ALL PROGRAMS INVOLVED AND WE BELIEVE- THAT- OUR MITIGATION PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED AND WELL JUST WELL SUITED TO MEETING THIS MISSION AND SHARING IT ON FOR DECADES TO COME. THANK YOU CHAIR AND I WILL TURN. MY BACK. THANK YOU CHIEF PORTER- AND I'M SURE MEMBERS WILL FOLLOW UP WITH QUESTIONS- APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND ALSO FOR. KEEPING US SAFE OUT THERE AND FIGHTING THESE FIRES AS OF RIGHT NOW THIS VERY MOMENT- WE HAVE TWO MORE PANELISTS WE'RE GONNA INVITE UP I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER BUT NO WINTER KEY DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCHER WHO. IS HERE AS WELL AS MISS LORI LYNN MISSOURI WHO'S WITH CALLAWAY YES THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND SHE'S THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTIO- BUT BEFORE THOSE TWO PANELISTS TAKE. TAKE THE MIKE- WE WILL TAKE A BRIEF PAUSE LET US CLEAN THE STAND AND- I'LL HEAD OVER TO THE VICE CHAIR. SINCERELY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PARTICIPATION TODAY WILL BE FOLLOWING UP SOON. OKAY WE'RE BACK SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND- NORMAN ARE YOU STILL THERE. I AM I AM HERE AND GIVE ME OR YES WE CAN GO AHEAD- WE JUST DID OUR SWITCH AND GO AHEAD AND PROCEED. GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANK YOU TO THAT CHAIR VICE CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE INVITATIONS TO JOIN TODAY'S SESSION. AS MENTIONED I'M DOING PART OF KEY I'M DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. AND I ALSO SHARE OUR ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE COUNCIL WHICH IS THE ONLY PUBLIC BODY IN STATE GOVERNMENT THAT IS SPECIFICALLY CHARGED TO FOCUS ON CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE. IN MY COMMENTS TODAY I'M GONNA DISCUSS YOURS ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE WORK THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM AND SPECIFICALLY OUR WORK TO ENSURE THAT ADAPTATION EFFORTS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MOST FORMAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. I JUST WANTED TO START MY SECOND NAME ALL THE IMPORTANT POINTS THAT THE SPEAKERS HERE TODAY MADE ON THAT IN A COUPLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. ACROSS THE STATE AND- RECOGNIZE THAT FUNDAMENTALS ARE WORKING- PR ON ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCE IS THE RECOGNITION OF THE RESILIENCE CALIFORNIA IS ONE WHERE. NO COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT BEHIND. SO DO FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT AND- IS THE STATE'S LONG RANGE AGENCY FOCUSED ON LAND USE TRANSPORTATION AND HOUSING. TRANSACTION AND CLIMATE RESILIENCE OPR IS WELL POSITIONED TO INTEGRATE THESE ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE AND LOCAL ADAPTATION EFFORTS THAT BENEFIT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. THE MOST FORMAL CALIFORNIANS. AND SENATE BILL TWO FORTY SIX ESTABLISHED OUR ADAPTATION PROGRAM ID CARD THE INTEGRATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY PROGRAM AND ARE CHARGED FOR DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE IS TO ALIGN STATE AND LOCAL ADAPTATION EFFORTS BY TAKING A REALLY TRULY INTEGRATED AND COLLABORATIVE. AND CROSS SECTORAL APPROACH. RELATED THE NEED FOR IN TODAY'S SESSION. AND HEARD THE ENABLING STATUTE THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT CROSS CUTTING PRIORITIES THAT INFORM ALL THE WORK WE DO. THE FIRST IS PRIORITIZATION AND INTEGRATION OF EQUITY INTO THE SAME EXACT MISSION EFFORTS AND THE SECOND IS DRIVING ON AN INTEGRATED CLIMATE ACTION BRINGS TOGETHER MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION AS EQUAL COMPONENTS TO THE STATE'S FRAMEWORK ON CLIMATE. SO NOW I'M TRANSITIONING WITH THAT BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT TRANSITIONING TO OUR WORKAROUND IDENTIFYING AND DEFINING FOLDABLE COMMUNITIES IN AN ADAPTATION CONTACTS. THROUGH I. CAR WE'VE BEEN LEADING THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE OUR WORK ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND ADAPTATION IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THIS INCLUDES THE FOUNDATIONAL WORK WE'VE DONE WITH OUR COUNCIL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN RECOGNIZING THE DESPERATE AND INEQUITABLE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE CHANGE HAS ACROSS THE STATE ONE OF THE FIRST AND FOUNDATIONAL BODIES OF WORKER COUNCIL TOOK ON WAS TO DEFINE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCE SOMETHING THAT HAD NOT BEEN DONE BEFORE. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO THE DETAIL IN THE DEFINITION BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SHARE ADDITIONAL DETAILS OR FOLLOW UP IN THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATIONS BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THIS DEFINITION FOR WHOLE COMMUNITIES HAS SINCE BEEN CODIFIED IN SENATE BILL THIRTEEN TWENTY. AND IS NOW IN STATE STATUTE. SO LOOKING TO OUR WORK AHEAD WELL- WERE TWO. THE DEFINITE. HAS HELPED LINE AND DRIVE STATE AND LOCAL WORK MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE SENSE ASK YOUR TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED PLATFORM. TO MAKE THIS DEFINITION ACTIONABLE FOR ADAPTATION POLICY AND INVESTMENT DECISIONS STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE STATE AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ADVOCATES ON THE GROUND. FOR INSTANCE THIS IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN A TENSE MAPPING RESILIENCE REPORT. SO TO ADDRESS THIS NEED WE'RE JUST KICKING OFF AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP OUR OWN WHOLE COMMUNITIES PLATFORM THERE ARE THREE HIGH LEVEL GOALS AND I'M JUST GONNA RUN THROUGH QUICKLY HERE OF THIS EFFORT. THE FIRST IS DEVELOPING AN OPEN ACCESSIBLE AND COMMUNITY CROWDED PLATFORM THE HOLISTICALLY IDENTIFIES A COMMUNITY'S MOST VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. MANY OF THE SPEAKERS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE CHALLENGE IN THIS EFFORT AND REALLY HAVE THE- THE SPEAKERS HERE TODAY AND HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THE NEED TO A MUCH MORE INTEGRATED APPROACH. SO THE SECOND CALL THAT WE'RE WORKING TO DRIVE ON IS RECOGNIZING THAT THIS PLATFORM WILL NOT REPLACE EXISTING STATUTORILY MANDATED OR SECTOR SPECIFIC DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS. INSTEAD PULL THIS IMPORTANT CROSS SECTOR INFORMATION TOGETHER HELP DECISION MAKERS UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE. TO VULNERABILITY IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE. AND THIRD. VERY- GOAL IS THE ARGUMENT TO. YOU FOR LOOKING CLIMATE RISK DATA TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE NO LONGER SOLELY RELYING ON BACKWARD LOOKING HAZARD DATA THAT DOES NOT GIVE US THE FULL PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE FACING. AND THIS LAST POINT THAT I MENTIONED IS A GAP IN THE STATE'S CURRENT TOOL BOX IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS. IN CONTEXT OF FUTURE CLIMATE IMPACTS SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO BE DRIVING AROUND IN CLOSING THAT GAP WITH MY DENNIS LINE. SO ONE OF THE LAST POINT ANIME HERE BEFORE I HAND IT BACK IS I WAS ASKED TO DATE TO SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE A BRIEF COMPARISON OF HOW THIS WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THROUGH OUR PROGRAM TO DEVELOP OUR OWN WILL TO UNITY'S PLATFORM. COMPARES TO FEMA'S RECENTLY RELEASED NATIONAL RESCUE NEXT FALL. WELL IMMENSELY VALUABLE THERE ARE TWO IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS THE FIRST IS THAT THE PAYMENT TOOL DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT GAP THAT I MENTION IT DOES NOT WITH ONE EXCEPTION. INCLUDES FORWARD LOOKING FUTURE CLIMATE PROJECTION RISK IT IS BASED ON BACKWARD LOOKING DATA WHICH IS IMPORTANT. BUT DOES NOT TELL THE WHOLE PITURE OF WHAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING. SO OUR LITTLE COMMUNITIES PLATFORM AGAIN WILL BRING IN THAT FUTURE LOOKING INFORMATION FROM THE STATE'S WEALTH OF INFORMATION WE HAVE BEEN DOWNSCALED CLIMATE PROJECTION. DATA THE SECOND DIFFERENCE IS THAT HE PAYMENT TOOL TAKES AN INTERESTING APPROACH ASSIGNING A COMPETENT SCORE TO EACH CENSUS TRACT ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MAKE RELATIVE COMPARISONS. IT DOES NOT PROVIDE US IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT PROBLEM AND THIS DEFINITELY IS NOT A CRITICISM I THINK THIS TOOL IS VERY VALUABLE IN PROVIDING A USEFUL INITIAL SCREEN. BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE US IN CALIFORNIA AND DECISION MAKERS INSIGHT INTO HOW TO TARGET LOCAL SOLUTIONS TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. FOR EXAMPLE TO COMMUNITIES CAN HAVE THE SAME RANK AND THE SAME SCORE BUT DRIVEN BY VERY DIFFERENT RISKS. AND THE CURRENT- TOOL THIS NOT. IN INTO UNDER. HOW TO TIE AND THOSE RISKS THIS IS ALSO A GAP THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO FILL THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PLATFORM. SO TO CONCLUDE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS WORK PRESENTS CALIFORNIA OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OUR NATIONAL LEADERSHIP ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND RESIDENT BINDINGS JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ORDER. CALLS FOR TARGETED CLIMATE INVESTMENTS IN UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES PRIORITIZING INVESTMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES VULNERABLE TO CLIMATE IMPACTS. WILL GOVERNMENT STARTS TO MAP OUT HOW THEY WILL MEET THIS LAUDABLE GOAL WHICH THEY ISSUED INITIAL GUIDANCE ON JUST YESTERDAY. OUR WORK TO DEVELOP THE FIRST NATIONALLY FIRST IN THE NATION VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES PLATFORM CAN SERVE AS A MODEL. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO CLOSE BY THINKING AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE TODAY WE APPRECIATE THE SAME. INVESTMENT AND EQUITABLE ADAPTATION ACTION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. AND ANY FOLLOW UP DISCUSSION. WE THANK YOU KNOW WHEN SO NOW JUST HAVE A LAST. LAURIE ARE YOU STILL THERE. RIGHT HERE OKAY LORI WILL END IT OFF WITH YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS LAUREN IS SURE- I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION HELLO YES. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON CALLOW YESS EFFORTS IN CLIMATE DISASTER RISK AND EQUITY. SO A LACK OF MEANINGFUL AND CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT WITH DIVERSE AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL AND STATE MITIGATION AND EMERGENCY PLANNING PLANNING. RESULTS IN PROCESSES PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF POPULATIONS MOST IMPACTED BY DISASTERS I THINK ONE OF THE PANELISTS POINTED THAT OUT TODAY. WITH THAT IN MIND HELLO YES IS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS WITH MORE IN THE PIPELINE TO ADDRESS THAT INEQUITY THROUGH VARIOUS STRATEGIES. AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. FIRST YEAH HELLO YES FIRST PUBLISHED THE CALIFORNIA ADAPTATION PLANNING GUIDE OR EPG AND TWENTY TWELVE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND WITH FUNDING FROM FEMA AND THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. THE TWENTY TWENTY UPDATE INCLUDES BEST PRACTICES GLEANED OVER THE ENSUING EIGHT YEARS. AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING REQUIREMENTS PASSED THROUGH VARIOUS PIECES OF LEGISLATION OVER THE YEARS. LAST YEAR OKAY ARE INTEGRATED A WEB BASED VERSION OF THE A. P. G. INTO THE ADAPTATION CLEARING HOUSE. B. A. P. T. ISN'T AN EVOLVING FOR PHASE THREE SOURCE DOCUMENT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGE IN ADAPTATION PLANNING. IN ALL THE PHASES EQUITY IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT BY INCLUDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEANINGFUL INVOLVEMENT. FROM MEMBERS OR LEADERS OF FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPATED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND OFTEN UNDER REPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. B. A. P. G. CALLS OUT THE NECESSITY TO ENGAGE- COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS OTHER NON GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS SOCIAL JUSTICE GROUPS NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS CULTURAL GROUPS AND MORE. THIS ENGAGEMENT ALSO SUPPORTS EQUITABLE EMERGENCY RESPONSE BY BUILDING TRUSTING COMMUNITY AWARENESS AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING LOCAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN COMMUNITY LEADERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BEFORE DISASTERS OCCUR. FOR EXAMPLE HELLO YES RECENTLY JOINED A WILDFIRE PREPAREDNESS SESSION CO HOSTED BY THE CALIFORNIA LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE TO DISCUSS WILDFIRE SEASON EFFORTS WITH- COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS COUNTY OFFICES OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. ST CBO CONTRACTOR SERVING FARM WORKERS. OFFICE THAT MY GREAT SERVICE CENTER OPERATORS AND MEXICAN CONSULATE. THEY THINK IT IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLABORATE ACROSS STATE ENTITIES AND WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS THAT SUPPORT MEETING THE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS AGRICULTURAL WORKERS WHO AGAIN ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IN ADDITION TO BEING AN HISTORICALLY UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY.ANOTHER TOOL THAT DRIVES ALL STATE PLANNING AND MITIGATION EFFORTS AT CALLAWAY- IF THAT THREAT AND HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT BYRON FOR SHORT. AND THE CORRESPONDING STAKEHOLDER PREPAREDNESS REVIEW. SO THE ENTIRE PROCESS HELPS COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THE NORMAL SET OF RISKS THEY FACE pTHOSE THREATS A COMMUNITY HE CAN THEN MAKE SMARTER DECISIONS AS THEY MANAGE APPROPRIATE PLANNING MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND DEVELOPING NEEDED CAPABILITY. USING TARGETS FROM THE FIRA HUMANITIES IDENTIFY THEIR CAPABILITIES LOST THE STAINED AND BUILT AND THIS IS REPORTED IN THE STAKEHOLDER PREPAREDNESS REVIEW. THIS PROCESS PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION FOR MY TRIP HELLO YES IS PLANNING GUIDE SUCH AS OUR EXTREME HEAT CONTINGENCY PLAN THE POWER DISRUPTION TOOL KIT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST IMPORTANT PLANS TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE DRIVEN DISASTERS THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN. THE TWENTY EIGHTEENS UPDATED STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLAN INCLUDES AMONG OTHER THINGS UPDATED CLIMATE MITIGATION PROGRESS AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES INCLUDING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WHICH HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF IDENTIFYING THE INTERSECTION OF SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDICATORS. WITH KNOWN HAZARDS AND THREATS AND PRIORITIZING MITIGATION EFFORTS AND FUNDING THERE. IT ALSO HOLDS OUT BROAD STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN THE PROCESS TO IMPROVE CROSS SECTOR COORDINATION WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ENGAGEMENT WITH UNDERSERVED OR RURAL BOULDER OPAL POPULATIONS- AND UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. ADMITS HE MENTIONED HELLO THIS IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COUNCIL FOR I. CARD. AND PROVIDES AN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE TO THE PROGRAM. THE GOVERNOR'S LISA'S CALIFORNIA EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN OR TEXAS CALIFORNIA FOR SHORT. WHICH WAS ADMINISTERED THROUGH CALLOW YES IN CHALFONT TEARS HAS BEEN AN INVALUABLE TOOL TO ENHANCE COMMUNITY DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ACROSS OUR DIVERSE STATE. AND TO COMBAT HOUSING AND FOOD AND SECURITY AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES- INTEGRATED PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LEAST OF CALIFORNIA HAS DEVELOPED VARIOUS MEASURES DESIGNED TO CONNECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITH LIFE CHANGING AND LIFESAVING GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. FOR EXAMPLE A FARM WORKER INITIATIVE WAS FIRST OF ITS KIND EFFORT TO DELIVER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION THROUGH AUDIO RECORDINGS IN A VARIETY OF COMMONLY SPOKEN LANGUAGES INCLUDING LANGUAGES INDIGENOUS TO LATIN AMERICA. WE'VE CREATED SPECIFIC DISASTER READY GUIDES FOR FARM WORKERS AND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND WE'VE CONDUCTED SOCIAL BRIDGING PHONE INITIATIVES TO CONNECT OLDER CALIFORNIANS WITH RESOURCES AND PREPAREDNESS MATERIALS. WITH OVER THREE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES REACHED OVER THE TWO YEARS OF THIS PROGRAM. THIS INITIATIVE HAS BECOME A MODEL FOR THE NATION AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE PUT ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS INTO CALLOW YESS LEAST AS CALIFORNIA GRANT PROGRAM FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET YEAR. OTHER CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ACTIONS THAT WILL FURTHER EQUITY OBJECTIVES INCLUDE TWENTY NINE POINT NINE MILLION FOR A NEW HELLO YES OFFICE OF EQUITY. AND THIS DOES INCLUDE THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR LISA'S CALIFORNIA GRANTS THAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- I AND SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH A MULTI AGENCY WILD. WILDFIRE FORECASTS AND THREAT INTELLIGENCE INTEGRATION CENTER. AND THE ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS FOR PER CALIFORNIA A PROGRAM TO BUILD DISASTER RESILIENT COMMUNITIES. THIS LATTER ONE TIME FUNDING WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES BY COVERING UP 21100% OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COST SHARE FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE FEDERAL. HAZARD MITIGATION GRANT PROGRAM- ALSO TO CONDUCT OUTREACH TO DISADVANTAGE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS THEY APPLY FOR FEDERAL GRANTS. THE OFFICE OF EQUITY WILL FOCUS ON THE NEEDS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITH CONSIDERATION TO RACE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AMONG OTHER FACTORS. WHILE ENSURING CONSISTENT ENGAGEMENT WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT THOSE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THE OFFICE WILL DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN WITH EQUITY OBJECTIVES THAT WILL GUIDE NOT ONLY OUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS BUT ALSO ALL OF RESPONSE RECOVERY AND MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AND OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE AT THE STATE LEVEL. BY FOCUSING ON THE NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE THESE INVESTMENTS BY THE STATE WILL FURTHER STRENGTHEN CONNECTIONS AND TRUST. AS WELL AS BUILD RESILIENCY WITH ALL COMMUNITIES. WITH THAT OUT BECAUSE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'LL STAND BY FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU LORD FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL JUST ONE CHECK ANY MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. I JUST HAD A FEW BEFORE YOU GO TOWARDS THE PUBLIC COMMENT- CHIEF ROSE ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK YOU DO OR- ARE YOU FOLKS OUT THERE DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME RETURN FIRE SEASON. ONE QUESTION I ASKED ONE OF THE FIRST TIME WAS IN THE BEGINNING REGARDING. THE CONTROLLED BURNS ARE PRESCRIBED BURNS HOW HOW YOU WANT TO CALL THEM. WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT HOW MANY ACRES A YEAR WE WOULD HAVE TO BURN IN PART FOR HOW MANY YEARS TO TRY TO GET A BETTER HOLD HANDLE ON. ON THE ISSUES YOU'RE FACING IN THE STATE REGARDING OUR OUR ARMED. FORCES LANDS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION BY SHARE- I. THINK WHAT I'M GONNA POINT BACK TO IS- THE FOREST CARBON PLAN. FIRST CARBON PLAN. IDENTIFIES MILLION ACRES OF TREATMENT ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S LANDSCAPES THAT FEDERAL AND- STATE RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDING THE PRIVATE LANDS. 47% OF THE LAND. IS IN PRIVATE. THE OWNERSHIP. WRONG 57% IS FEDERAL LANDS 40% PRIVATE AND 3% IS IN STATE CONTROL SO OF THAT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES IN EACH OF THOSE FEDERAL OR NON FEDERAL JURISDICTIONS THAT DOESN'T ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WHAT YOUR QUESTION IS HOW MUCH PRESCRIBED FIRE- SHOULD WE BE PUTTING ON THE GROUND. WE NEED TO DO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF TREATMENT IN THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE STATE SOME OF THAT WILL BE- PRESCRIBED FIRE PRESCRIBED FIRE RIGHT NOW IS GOING TO BE A SMALL PIECE OF THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF LAND THAT'S NOT IN A HEALTHY ENOUGH STATE TO BE ABLE TO APPLY- PRESCRIBED FIRE TO IT WITHOUT HAVING CATASTROPHIC- CONEQUENCES SO WE NEED TO GET WE NEED TO FOR A WHILE DO A LOT OF FOREST AND FUELS MANAGEMENT ACTIVITY- AND THEN GET THOSE LANDS IN THE MAINTENANCE WITH WILD OR WITHOUT PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND GET US BACK TO MORE OF THAT- TRADITIONAL CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF FIRE ON THE LANDSCAPE THAT I WAS MENTIONING THAT INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DID BEFORE- SO WE GOT THE- ECOSYSTEM SO OUT OF BALANCE FROM WHERE THEY ARE SO RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES MAYBE FIFTY SIXTY THOUSAND ACRES OVER TIME THAT NUMBER SHOULD GROW AND APPROACH AT LEAST PROBABLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF HALF OF THOSE ACRES SOMEWHERE AROUND TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES. BUT THAT MAY TAKE DECADES TO GET TO. THANK YOU TO. OF JUST ANOTHER QUESTION MAYBE FOR NORM RULE WE TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAMS ARE LOOKING TO DEVELOP TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF THE EQUITY ISSUES AND OTHERS- BUT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING TO ON OUR DISASTER MITIGATION PLANS. TO SUFFICIENTLY MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT'S SOMETHING OBVIOUSLY WE'RE LOOKING AT AS WELL JUST DIDN'T KNOW IF I CAN ELABORATE A BIT MORE ON THAT. SO I CAN TAKE THE FIRST STEP AT THAT- AS THAT HELLO YES WE DO LOOK AT LOCAL HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS WE ALSO HAVE THE STATE HAZARD MITIGATION PLANS- WE HAVE- VARIOUS SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDICES THAT WE- WE OVERLAY- ON OUR MAPS. TO IDENTIFY THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MAY NEED MORE MITIGATION EFFORTS AND- THOSE. ARE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PEOPLE WITH EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS AND CHRONIC DISEASES- YOUNG CHILDREN PERCENTAGES OF OLDER ADULTS- PERSONAGES OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OUTDOOR WORKERS IMMIGRANTS AND REFUGEES- THE LIST IS MUCH LONGER THAN MY BRAIN CAN REMEMBER BUT- WE DO LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE AND ENCOURAGE LOCALS WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING THEIR PLANS TOGETHER NOT JUST TO LOOK AT THE EIGHT JURISDICTION AS A WHOLE. BUT TO LOOK AT EACH COMMUNITY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION YEAH OKAY THANK YOU- ON THAT AGAIN LAURIE REAL QUICK. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LEASE DOES PROGRAM. CURRICULA FOR IRAN BUT YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE MILLION COMING TO- THAT PROGRAM OR JUST WANT WHAT WE CAN EXPECT MORE- WITH THE LEAST OLD PROGRAM. WITH THAT TWENTY FIVE MILLION MORE COMING. SO THAT WHEN FIVE MILLION ONE- IDENTIFIED FOR THE SERVICE GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WAS- WITH THE- CURRENT OR THE LASTLY STEPS- ALLOCATIONS OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WERE SPLIT THIRTY MILLION TO HELP VOLUNTEERS TWENTY MINUTE MILLION TO HELLO YES SPORT- AND THAT TWENTY MILLION WAS USED FOR. HE CBO GRANTS. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT- CONTINUATION OF THOSE GRANTS AND THOSE ARE THE TRUSTED PARTNERS THAT BANKING REACH OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO SUB GRANT. SO- EVEN THOUGH WE HAD. TWENTY FOUR GRANTEES FOR OUR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ANSWER TWENTY MILLION LAST TIME. THEY SAID GRANTED TO OVER THREE HUNDRED LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SO WE'RE LOOKING TO CONTINUE THAT SAME- MODEL GOING FORWARD. IF THERE'S ANYTHING MORE TO BE ADDED WITH THE LEAST THOSE PROGRAM THEN THAT WILL COME BACK IN AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THOSE WOULD BE ALL THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR TODAY. AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PRESENTERS FOR PRESENTING TAKING SOME TIME OUT OF YOUR BUSY SCHEDULES AS WELL. TO COME AND SHARE. SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND- ALL THE ISSUES FACING INCOME. SO THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL YOUR HELP WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOT ONLY FOR THE STATE BUT- FOR THE NATION I THINK BECAUSE I THINK WE- WE CAN BECOME A ROLE MODEL FOR OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO MOVE ON TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT BUT I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND INVITE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WANTED TO PARTICIPATE. THE CALL AND NOW IF THEY WISH- THE NUMBER ONCE AGAIN THE CALL IN IS ONE EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. THREE THREE SIX FOUR FOUR THREE SEVEN WHEN PROMPTED PLEASE USE THE ACCESS CODE OF EIGHT TWO SIX. EIGHT FOUR TWO EIGHT. AND NOW WE'LL MOVE ON TO. A PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN THE GALLERY. SCENE I BELIEVE THERE IS ONE PERSON THERE. SO MEMORABLE HEAD YOU HAVE- TWO MINUTES GO AHEAD AND STICK TO YOUR NAME IN THE COMMENTS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS THOMAS YATES THE SECOND. AND I WANT TO APPLAUD EVERYBODY IN THIS STATE HERE FOR THEIR EXCELLENT ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT DISASTER THEREFORE YOU ARE IN I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS RATHER THAN THE CONSEQUENCES SO MUCH THE CAUSE. AND IT CAUGHT MULTIPLE CAUSES AND WHAT COULD BE DONE TO ADDRESS THEN HOPEFULLY SOME OF YOUR- POSITIONS OVERLAP INTO THAT FIELD. SO WE ALL HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT'S MORE IMPORTANT STOPPING THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE WITH ITS RISING TEMPERATURES CAUSING DEATH AND DESTRUCTION ON AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE. OR CONTINUING TO DRIVE OUR GAS GUZZLING SUVS AND PICKUPS. BURNING AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF GASOLINE IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S TOP CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE CLIMATE CATASTROPHE COMMUTERS HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THE GAS AND THEY ARE BUYING AND BURNING IS CAUSING OUR ON GOING DISASTER. THE MOST IMPORTANT WAY TO TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS HIS FIRST TEST START SETTING GREAT GOALS- THIS PERCENTAGE- THAT PERCENTAGE OF OUR CLIENT CARBON FREE. EMISSIONS BY A CERTAIN DATE WILL NEVER AMOUNT TO ANYTHING IF WE DON'T START. IT'S UP TO US NOT THE GOVERNMENT CERTAINLY NOT CORPORATIONS.

AFTER GETTING THE THIRTY TWO HAD BENEFITED FROM QUANTITATIVE EFFECTS ACTUALLY REQUIREMENTS WOULD USUALLY HAVE DEFINITIONS. ANY REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE AT THE GOAL LINE FOR A FOUNDATION. AND MITIGATING CHANGE. CALIFORNIA HAD NO SIMILAR GOALS WITH RESPECT TO CLIMATE ADAPTATION RESILIENCE. THE ULTIMATE LEVEL OF A TEMPERATURE INCREASE IT IN THE COMMENTS ARE INTACT CALIFORNIA WILL DEPEND ON HOW WELL THE ENTIRE WORLD THE MISSION. AND UNFORTUNATELY GLOBAL EFFORTS TO DATE ARE FALLING BEHIND THE NECESSARY EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THE STAY WITHIN THE PARIS CLIMATE AGREEMENT COMMITMENT TO KEEP LOCAL TEMPERATURES. INCREASE AS WELL YOU COULD TELL. YES THE CALC MIGHT BE PREPARED IT CAN BE MUCH GREATER CLIMATE IMPACT IN TWO TO THREE THIS CENTURY- BUT CURRENTLY THERE IS NO STATE POLICY THAT ESTABLISHES A CLEAR GOAL LINE. HOW WARM THE WORLD WE MUST PREPARE FOR AND AS A RESULT LANDING IN THE KITCHEN MAKING PROPERTY. ACROSS STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA TAKE VARIED APPROACHES. IN DETERMINING WHAT LEVEL OF GLOBAL WARMING IF THE PATIENT FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION EFFORTS- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH LEAVES. OPEN THE VERY REAL POT IN THE STATE AND LOCAL OPINION MAKERS.

THE COMPUTER THE FAILING KILLER- PUBLICLY A FEW WEEKS AGO IT RECEIVED NO MEDIA COVERAGE ONE OF THE MOST IMMEDIATE HELP PROTECT THEM FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.
