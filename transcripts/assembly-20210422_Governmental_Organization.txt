IT IS A REGIONAL BENEFITS TO THE ENTIRE PARK BUT YOUR SPECIFICS WERE CORRECT SIR. AREN'T THERE ENOUGH BUT NONE THE LESS NEITHER ONE OF US WERE CONTACTED AND- CONSULTED ON WHETHER OR NOT TO WORK WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL SO THAT IMPLIES WE'RE A STRONG PART OF MY OPPOSITION IS. BUT THREE THE OTHER PART OF MY OPPOSITION FOR EVERYONE HERE IS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THIS PARTICULAR CONSERVANCY WAS CREATED. TO BE OF A REGIONAL BENEFIT IN BETWEEN FRESNO MADERA COUNTY YORTY HER TESTIMONY BOTH FRESNO MADERA COUNTY OR NOT OPPOSITION. HENCE HERE WE HAVE A CHANGE OF DIRECTION. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD THE DIRECTION OF THIS CONSERVANCY WAS TO BE BALANCED UNDER LOCAL CONTROL AND NOW WE'RE MOVING IT AWAY FROM LOCAL CONTROL TO STATE CONTROL. WHEN YOU HAVE THE TO LOCAL COMMUNITY SAYING WE'RE NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. I THINK THAT GIVES US PAUSE AND RESUME TO TAKE A POSITION OF NO. SO I AS ONE WOULD ASK YOU AS RESPECTFULLY% TO EITHER NOT VOTE. OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. OR VOTE NO I RESPECT FOR ME. THE CHOICE IS YOURS. NOPE NO DISRESPECT TO THE AUTHOR IN OUR GOOD FRIENDS. BUT IT IS A TOUGH ISSUE. SO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW ANY OTHER MR SALAS AND WILL GO TO MISTER REYNOLDS. MISTER SELF THANK YOU MISTER REGISTERED A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR ON THE- LOCAL SUPPORT DO YOU HAVE. ARE THERE ANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ALL CALORIES ARE IN SUPPORT OF- THE MEASURE. THANK YOU SIR- WE HAVE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE HAVE BOTH THE CITY OF MADERA AS WELL AS THE CITY OF FRESNO. WHO HAVE PASSED RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT OF AB FIVE FIVE NINE I BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THE OFFICES HERE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED THOSE RESOLUTIONS IN SUPPORT. AND BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE STANDING UP FOR THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY SPEAKING LOUDLY ABOUT THE NEED FOR AB FIVE FIVE NINE. THANK INCLUDE YOUR QUESTIONS MISTER CELLS MISTER RAMOS. THANK UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR DOES THIS- ALSO INCLUDE THE PARTICIPATION OF LOCAL AREA TRIBES IN THIS- ENDEAVOR MOVING FORWARD. WELL WE HAVE NOT SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED THE TRIBAL ORGANIZATIONS OR- NATIVE AMERICAN. GROUPS WHO WE WILL PASS PIC WE ARE LEAVING THAT UP TO THE LOCALS THERE ARE MANY TRIBAL NATIONS IN MY COMMUNITY FOR US TO CHOOSE BETWEEN JUST TO GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES WE HAVE THE TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA AT THE BIG SANDY RANCHERIA AND THE COLD SPRINGS RANCHERIA WITHIN FRESNO COUNTY. AND MADERA COUNTY WE HAVE THE NORTH FORK RANCHERIA AND THE PICK A YUN RANCHERIA OF THE TWO CHANCY TRIBE AS WELL. THANK YOU AND INTO THE AUTHOR AGAIN AND TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN INCLUDING- THE LOCAL TRAVEL REPRESENTATIVES IN THIS THESE TYPES OF ACTIONS IT TO MY KNOWLEDGE IT IS BUT IT REALLY SPEAKS TO MANY OF US ABOUT THE NEED FOR THE ORIGINAL STEWARDS OF OUR LANDS TO HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE. TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN PARTICIPATE AND CREATE THE CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE OF THE AUTHOR. ME JUST A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR COULD YOU GIVE ME THE REASON WHY YOU DIDN'T GO ON TO CEMENT PATTERSON AND ARE THERE SOME MEMBER CONSIDERING THIS IS THEIR DISTRICT A TO ASK YOU KNOW IS IT WHERE THEY STOOD AND MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BENEFICIAL PERHAPS IT WOULD EVEN CALL AUTHORED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM AND- JUST FOR HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE THIS IS MY FOURTH YEAR INTRODUCING A BILL TO WORK ONTHE CONSERVANCY. AND THE LAST LEGISLATIVE CYCLE THE BILL WAS ALSO NUMBERED AB FIVE FIVE NINE. AND SO JUST FOR COMPARISON I WILL SAY THIS HAS BEEN A TOPIC IN AN AREA OF FOCUS FOR MY OFFICE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. MR COOLEY MINISTER MATHIS. SO REMEMBER ARAMBULA I JUST WANT TO ASK I'M A FORMER OFFICER STATEWIDE OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES. AND- THE QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE- WHERE IS HE MAYOR FRESNO ON THIS JUST FOR THE RECORD HE SAID THE CITY FRESNO IS A SUPPORT. BUT HISTORICALLY I THINK THAT'S A MORE OF A STRONG MAYOR JURISDICTION- AND I HEARD WHERE THE MAYOR MATERIALS WE USE COMMON UPON THAT. GREAT QUESTION WE HAVE NOT ASKED FOR THE OPINION CURRENTLY OF THE MAYOR OF FRESNO. I WILL SHARE THAT THE RESOLUTION WHICH PASSED THE PRESENCE CITY COUNCIL TODAY HAD SIX OF THE SEVEN MEMBERS VOTE IN SUPPORT OF. MISTER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- QUESTION G. OPERATE I KNOW WE DISCUSSED IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE ABOUT WHY- YOU'VE DECIDED TO HAVE THE NEW APPOINTEES BE BE GIVEN FROM A STATE LEVEL VERSUS FROM A LOCAL LEVEL- I HAVE. A I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YOU'VE CHANGED THAT- MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS ENSURING THAT AS WE'RE DOING THESE CONSERVANCIES WE KEEP TO THE LOCAL CONTROL AND AS I SAID BEFORE. ALLOWING A POSITION FOR TRAVEL SUPPORT ALLOWING THESE OTHER POSITIONS I DO SEE AS IMPORTANT TOOLS. IN OUR IMPORTANT VOICES TO HAVE BUT I DO HAVE THAT LARGE CONCERN ABOUT IT NOT COMING FROM THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. AND I KNOW- THROUGH SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF YOUR OPPOSITION THEY DO SHARE THAT SAME OPINION SO WHY IS IT YOU FEEL SO INCLINED. TO NOT SET IT UP IN SUCH A WAY WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL CAN PICK THOSE PEOPLE VERSUS GIVING IT. TO SOMEBODY WHO'S OVER TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND JUST TO PROVIDE CLARIFICATION I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE TWO APPOINTMENTS WE ARE SPEAKING ABOUT WILL BE RESIDENTS OF. FRESNO OR MADERA COUNTIES. WHILE THOSE APPOINTMENTS MAY COME HERE AND SACRAMENTO IF THE LOCALS ARE UNABLE TO GAIN CONSENSUS AT THE END OF THE DAY THOSE WILL BE PEOPLE FROM OUR COMMUNITY WHO ARE HELPING TO MAKE DECISIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS ABOUT HOW WE- MAKE THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER A BETTER PLACE. GEN JUST FOR CLARIFICATION CHAIRMAN SO. THE THERE'S A TERM FOR THAT THOUGH AND IT'S CALLED CARPETBAGGERS JUST BECAUSE THEY LIVE THERE DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE FROM THERE SO LET'S KEEP THAT IN MIND SIR I THINK MANY OF THE TRIBAL NATIONS WOULD TAKE OFFENSE TO BEING CALLED CARPETBAGGERS THIS WAS THEIR LANDS LONG BEFORE MANY OF US CAME TO THE STATE. WELL AS I'M TALKING ABOUT ADDING A SEAT FOR TRIBAL NATIONS I JUST THERE'S TREMENDOUS. CAREFUL ABOUT THE WORDS WE USE. YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER MATHIS- NOT WE DON'T NEED A DIALOGUE WITH DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE CALL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS USING. THANK YOU SIR. HOW CAN I HELP. WHAT BEST DECISION THE NEW. MMHM MISTER BIGELOW WOULD LIKE TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION I. FOR MEDICAL. JUST A SIMPLE COMMENT I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ON THIS AND IT IS A DIFFICULT POSITION I WANT TO REMEMBER TO KNOW. TO GET A LANDOWNER TO COMMIT TO THE TIME IT TAKES TO BEING ON THE CONSERVANCY IS A HUGE UNDERTAKING AT THE SAME TIME THERE ARE VERY FEW. PRIVATE LANDOWNERS THAT ACTUALLY ON LAND WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES WITHIN THE CONSERVANCY THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE THE LANDOWNER GETS TO COME FROM IN BE CHOSEN FROM THE POOL OF NOMINEES TO BE REPRESENTED. I DO SUPPORT THE POSITION OF HAVING A TRIBAL ENTITY APPOINTED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR REPRESENTATION THAT HAS LONG BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S OVERDUE. AND HE DOES. ACCURATELY STATE ALTHOUGH THERE IS ONE THAT I'VE HIGH JUST FOR TRIVIA FOR EVERYONE. THERE IS A TRIBAL. IN EIGHTY THAT EXISTS TO THE DOGMA TRIED. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE LIVING MEMBER LEFT OF THAT FIVE ALONG THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER. BUT THERE ARE MANY TRIBES. THAT HAVE USE THAT AREA AS PART OF THEIR REGIONAL AND HOMELAND AREAS OF HISTORIC AND- RECORD. SO I WANT TO BE FAIR TO THE TO THE AUTHOR OF THIS LIKE I SAID BEFORE WE'RE FRIENDS WE JUST HAVE A LITTLE SLIGHT. SIDEWAYS DISAGREEMENT HERE BUT I REALLY THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK THIS THROUGH BEFORE WE MOVE. THE WEIGHTED VALUE AWAY FROM THE LOCAL. TO THE STATE BUT I DO APPRECIATE HIM WANTING TO MAKE THIS ADDITION. OF THE TRIBAL FOLKS AND I WANT TO GET THE CLARIFICATION THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR ALLOWING ME TO DO THAT. WITH THAT DO WE HAVE A MOTION. FOR THE OFFERS THE. SAWSAN VERSUS IN A SECOND AMERICA- CURRENTLY YOUR CURRENT- MISTER SINISTER A REGULAR. I REMEMBER GROWING UP IN BEING A FRIEND AND- STONE UP AND DOWN THE RIVER. IT'S GORGEOUS AREA. I APPRECIATE CONSERVANCY'S EFFORTS FOR THIS YOU KNOW AFTER THE REGULAR CHANNELS. ACTUALLY INSTALLED THE SECOND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER WAS HAS DRIED UP FOR PARAMEDIC SIXTY SOMETHING MILES- I'M HOPING THE CONSERVANCY CAN BRING THAT BACK TO LIFE AT SOME POINT IN TIME WITH THEIR EFFORTS. AND I THINK IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST A LOCAL EFFORT TO DO SOMETIMES. GOT TO WORK. SO OTHER THAN I FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD TODAY ABOUT MR BIG WAS CONCERNS. NO I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL ON THE ON THE MERITS THAT YOU'VE STATED BUT ALSO INSIST THAT YOU WORK WITH MR PATTERSON AND MR. BIGELOW GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I DO RESPECT MR BIGELOW AND HIS OPINION. I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT BUT I ALSO WANT TO INSIS THAT YOU HAVE A COLLABORATION. WHERE IT IS A REGIONAL APPROACH AND IT DOES. WORK WITH MR BIGELOW AS A FORMER SUPERVISOR IN THAT AREA. WAS VERY FINIT KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA. I WANT THAT. TO BE PART OF THE EQUATION. SO WITH THAT COMMITMENT FROM YOU AGAIN I DO HAVE A DO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS RECOMMENDED THAT SECRETARIES PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WITH THE PASSCODE THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE USED. SO WE'LL JUST GET RID OF THAT HOUSEKEEPING RIGHT NOW TO GET A PART APOLOGIZE FOR THE INTERRUPTION PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT. TODAY PRESENT AT TWELVE FORTY TWO A BILL THAT CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ALLOWING LACES RESTAURANTS TO CONTINUE SELLING MAKE UP A HOLIDAY DRINKS TO GO. THE COMBINED EFFECT THE NECESSARY. LOCKDOWNS IN THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THAT I HAVE DAVIS THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY. NATIONALLY A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND RESTAURANTS HAVE SHUTTERED IN TWO AND A HALF MILLION JOBS HAVE BEEN LOST. THESE ARE SMALL BUSINESSES FAMILY BUSINESSES PILLARS OF COMMUNITY AND BAD ROCKS OF FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR SO MANY. DURING THE PANDEMIC MOST BARS AND RESTAURANTS RELYING ON THE LIFELINE OF TAKE OUT BUSINESS. RECOGNIZING THIS DURING THE PANDEMIC THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING CALIFORNIA ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL TO TEMPORARILY LIFT ITS REGULATION THAT HAD BARRED TO GO ALCOHOL WOULD TAKE OUT MEALS. THIS IS A CRUCIAL BURNED TO RESTAURANTS AND BARS AS WELL AS WE NEED SAFETY MEASURE WILL INDOOR DINING ROOMMATE ARREST. WITH TAKE OUT WINE AND BEER ALREADY LEGAL TAKE OUT PRACTICES ARE COMMON SENSE AND PROFITABLE VENTURE HOWEVER AFTER THE PANDEMIC SUCH SALES WILL LIKELY BE PROHIBITED ONCE AGAIN. THIS PANDEMIC YOU'RE A COCKTAIL DELIVERY SHOWN THAT SUCH A PROHIBITION IS UNNECESSARY. FOR YEARS PEOPLE HAVE ORDERED PICKED UP AND ENJOYED MIXED DRINKS FROM THEIR FAVORITE RESTAURANTS AS PART OF A SAFE DINING EXPERIENCE. BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SAVED BY THIS INCOME WITH RESTAURANTS WHO SOLD ALCOHOL HAVING BEEN MORE LIKELY TO RE HIRE STAFF DURING THE PANDEMIC. AB TWELVE FORTY TO MAKE PERMANENT THE ABC ALLOWANCE FOR TAKE OUT COCKTAILS WITH FOOD. FOOD BUSINESSES ALREADY LICENSED TO SELL ALCOHOL ON THE PREMISES WOULD BE ABLE TO SELL COCKTAILS COCKTAILS IN SECURE CONTAINERS FOR TAKEOUT AND DELIVERY. I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS FROM THE ANTI ALCOHOL GROUPS AND ALLOWING THESE DRINKS TO BE TRANSPORTED THERE FOR OF AMENDED THE BILL TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. I ADDED TO YOUR SENSE ON THE BILL FROM THE DATE WHEN THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS LIFTED SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE. THAT THIS IS BEING DONE SAFELY. WE ALSO REQUIRED THAT IT CAN. LATE OR CO THE EFFECTS TO THE CAN IN A MANNER THAT MAKES IT OBVIOUS. WHEN I CAP. LATE OR SEAL THE BEEN REMOVED OR BROKEN. AND IT LIMITS THE DRINKS TO PER MAIL. WITH ME TODAY. TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FORTY TWO IS NOT SET IN WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION. AND LARA MAGU WITH THE REV BISTRO IN LAFAYETTE. SO LET'S MOVE FORWARD HERE WITNESSES MODERATE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MET CERTAIN THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A POLICY THAT'S BEEN TESTED IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A YEAR- UNDER THE ABC EMERGENCY REGULATIONS LAST MARCH AT THE OUTSET AND PANDEMIC THESE WERE PUT IN PLACE WHEN RESTAURANTS AT THE TIME WERE ORDERED- TO CEASE ALL INDOOR DINING IN ONLY DO DELIVERY AND TAKEOUT. WE'VE HAD A YEAR OF OSCILLATING ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN INDOOR DINING ONLY OUTDOOR DINING TAKEOUT DELIVERY NOT TKE OUT DELIVERY BACK AND FORTH BACK AND FORTH WHAT THIS DOES IS THIS HELPS HELPS GET THROUGH THAT PERIOD BUT IT ALSO LOOKS TO THE FUTURE AND HELPS MODERNIZE ALCOHOL LAWS WITH SAFETY PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. TO HELP ACCOMMODATE WHAT HAVE BECOME CHANGE CONSUMER DEMANDS AND- THE ABILITY FOR RESTAURANTS TO CONTINUE TO SERVE ALCOHOL IN A SAFE WAY- WITH MEALS- GOING OUT THE DOOR- AS WAS MENTIONED THERE'S A NUMBER OF PROTECTIVE PROTOCOLS PUT IN PLACE THE EMERGENCY REGULATION BUT ALSO IN THIS LEGISLATION AS WELL THOSE REGULATE EXACTLY HOW THE BEVERAGES LEAVE A RESTAURANT. AND PROVIDE FOR SAFE TRANSPORT OF THOSE TO A CONSUMER- SO WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND BELIEVE THAT THE STRIKES ARE REALLY GOOD BALANCE OF CONTINUING WHAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. THANK THANK YOU MOVE ON OUR MODERATOR. MODERATOR LAURA MAGOON.
