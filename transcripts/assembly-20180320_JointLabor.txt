I WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO THE JOINT HEARING. OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE SET UP TO DATE WE HAVE. A VERY FRUITFUL AND TIMELY DISCUSSION ABOUT AUTOMATION. I EN THERE IS BEEN MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND POSSIBLE. NATIVE ISSUES AS WELL TODAY WE HOPE TO HAVE A VERY ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT. OUR MODEL NATION OBVIOUSLY CAN BRING BENEFITS. THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT DISPLACEMENT OF JOBS AND WE THINK THAT THE CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT HOW WE WORK TOGETHER ACROSS SECTORS. OUGHT TO USE THOSE TECHNOLOGY BENEFITS. BUT NOT IN A WAY THAT IS NEARLY ABOUT REPLACING OF THE WORK FORCE AND SO WE HOPE TO HAVE A ROBUST DISCUSSION. UPON THOSE MATTERS TODAY AND WE WELCOME PARTICIPATION FROM ALL OF YOU. OUT WILL HEAR FROM OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF BOTH SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LABOR COMMITTEES AS THEY ARE COMING IN AND OUT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. NOW WE'VE GOT GREAT PANELS FOR YOU FROM SEVERAL SECTORS POSSIBLE GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED ON A ONE ACKNOWLEDGE MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE SIMULATOR COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. AND I INVITE HIM IF HE WISHES TO MAKE A FEW OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU A CHAIR THURMOND FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. AS CHAIR THEY WERE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO ON THIS ISSUE I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO EVERYONE THAT'S HERE TO BE PART OF THIS CONVERSATION THAT REALLY. IS LONG OVERDUE. BUT IS CERTAINLY NOT SIMPLE AND IT'S GONNA BE A AN ISSUE I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY BEING FROM SILICON VALLEY. BUT ANYWHERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE NATION WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH THE YEARS AHEAD OF WHERE. I WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PRESENTED TO US PUBLIC TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY. AND I THINK WE NEED TO FIND WAYS TO ALLOW THOSE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. A TO BOOST OUR OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK. AND AND QUALITY JOBS AND I THINK I THINK BOTH CAN BE DONE AND I THINK THEY THEY CAN BOTH BE DONE ONLY F. WERE ENGAGING. IN THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATIONS AND I APPRECIATE OUR CHAIR OF OF FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER TO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. THE MEMBER KALRA UP WE LIKE TO CALL OUR FIRST PANEL. WHICH WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE CURRENT AND FUTURE LANDSCAPE OF WORKING CALIFORNIA. WOULD PLEASE TO HAVE DAVID WHILE WHO IS THE DEAN OF THE HELLER SCHOOL FOR SOCIAL POLICY. AND DR ANNETTE BERNHARDT AT THE UC BERKELEY LAW LABOR CENTER IN MY DISTRICT WHERE PLEASE ADHERE. WE DO THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY ON THE ASSEMBLY. LABOR COMMITTEE I KNOW THAT THEY. PROBABLY ASK YOU TO TALK LONGER WE OFTEN ASK OUR PANELISTS JUST TO GIVE US THE HIGHLIGHTS GIVE IT SAYS TEN TO FIFTEEN MINUTES WE OFTEN ASKS THAT CONSIDER THAT. TO THREE AND GIVE US THE HIGHLIGHTS SO THAT. I'M CODE SWITCHING YOU KNOW THAT'S ASSEMBLY LABOR SPEAK FOR IT GIVE US THE HIGHLIGHTS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE MAJORITY THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. PALM BUT WE OBVIOUSLY WILL MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO GET ACROSS WHATEVER YOU NEED TO KNOW. THAT SAID WELCOME AYE WE WELCOME WE'RE READY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT IS QUITE A CHALLENGE FOR AN ACADEMIC OUT TO DO IT IN TWO MINUTES. APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND THE INVITATION FROM THE CHAIR AND AND THE MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE. I I'M I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF AUTOMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF SOME LARGER CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN IN THE WORKPLACE. THAT I THINK HAVE FUNDAMENTALLY ALREADY AFFECTED WORKING PEOPLE. AND I I COME TO THIS DISCUSSION WITH THE HAPPY BACKGROUND. MAY BE UNUSUAL BACKGROUND WHILE I HAVE BEEN AN ACADEMIC FOR MOST MY CAREER AND RECENTLY BECAME DEAN AT. BRANDEIS. I HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS THE HEAD OF THE WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION. AT THE LABOR DEPARTMENT WHERE I SAW MANY OF THESE CHANGES FIRST HAND. AS WE DID IN FORCE MEANT OF THE MINIMUM WAGE OVER TIME AND OUR OTHER BASIC LABOR STANDARDS OF FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TILL THE END OF THE ADMINISTRATION. AND THE COMMENTS I WANNA MAKE ARE BASED BOTH ON RESEARCH THAT I'VE DONE THAT OTHER PEOPLE INCLUDING. AND THAT A BURN HARD AND OTHERS HAVE DONE ON CHANGES IN THE WORKPLACE BUT ALSO DO REFLECT. WHAT WE FOUND VERY CLEARLY DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ABOUT PATTERNS OF CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF WORK AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS ON WORKING PEOPLE ON THE VIOLATION? OF MANY OF OUR MOST BASIC LABOR STANDARDS. THE MAIN POINTS I'D MAKE AND AND MAYBE IF I COULD TAKE MY TIME TO MAKE MY MAIN POINTS AND THEN GIVE ONE ILLUSTRATION THAT I THINK SPEAKS TO. THE TRANSFORMATION IS. MANY OF US IN ACADEMICS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN HAD TENDED. FUTURE OF WORK CONVENING SO OVER THE LAST A NUMBER OF YEARS OFTEN FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES OF AUTOMATION IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THEIR IMPACTS. ON LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT. WELL THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY WILL BE THE SUBJECT OF A LOT OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION. I WOULD ALSO MAKE THE POINT THAT THE FUTURE OF WORK IS ALREADY HERE AND THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN A PROFOUND TRANSFORMATION IN. THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE YEARS BUT ACCELERATED AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION. AND. I'VE TURNED THIS CHANGE THE FEATURED WORKPLACE IN THE FEATURED WORKPLACE. IT IS REALLY. BUSINESSES REORGANIZING. FOCUSING ON ONE HAND MORE AND MORE ON CORE COMPETENCIES AND BY CORE COMPETENCIES I MEAN THINGS LIKE BRANDING THEIR PRODUCTS. BRINGING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET DOING THINGS LIKE LOOK DELIVERING OUR PACKAGES TO OUR HOME. AT THE SAME TIME AS THEY'VE BEEN DOING THAT THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN. VERY. INCREASINGLY SHIFTING WORK OUT OF THEIR OWN EMPLOYMENT SUBCONTRACTING WORK FRANCHISING WORK USING THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS. TO AN EXTENT THAT PEOPLE DON'T OFTEN PERCEIVED. JUST HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO WE THINK ARE AMAZON EMPLOYEES WHO WE THINK ARE EMPLOYEES OF. A COMPANIES LIKE APPLE WHO ARE NO LONGER ACTUALLY THOSE DIRECT EMPLOYEES EVEN THOSE COMPANIES DIRECT THE DAY TO DAY ACTIVITIES AND IT IS IN THAT CONTEXT OF MAJOR CHANGES. THAT AUTOMATION. THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND OTHER OF TE AT THE TRENDS THAT ON YOU WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING ABOUT ARE TAKING PLACE IN. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF THOSE CHANGES. ON EARNINGS ON WAGES ON COMPLIANCE WITH OUR LABOR LAWS ON ACCESSIBILITY TO BAN BENEFITS HAVE BEEN AMPLIFIED IN MAKE WORK MADE WORSE. SO LET ME. JUST QUICKLY ILLUSTRATE WHAT I MEAN BY THE FEATURED WORKPLACE I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY INDUSTRY. AND I COULD GIVE YOU EXAMPLES NOT ONLY AFFECTING LOW WAGE WORKERS BUT INCREASINGLY WORKERS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF SKILLED WORKERS EVEN WITH GRADUATE DEGREES. EVEN LAWYERS ARE BEING AFFECTED BY BY THESE CHANGES BUT THEY PROFOUNDLY HIT WORKING PEOPLE WHO ARE OF LOWER WAGES AND OFTEN DON'T HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES. IN THE EXAMPLE I WANT TO GIVE YOU IS FROM RETAILING. AYE HUGE TRANSFORMATION IN THE WAY THAT GOODS ARE BROUGHT TO STORES AND MORE RECENTLY TO OUR OWN FRONT DOORS A BECAUSE OF A TRANSFORMATION OF THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. THE PICTURE THE SLIDE I HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU IS OF A DISTRIBUTION CENTER OF A MAJOR RETAILER. ODDS TO PART OF RETAIL DISTRIBUTION WE OFTEN DON'T SEE BUT IT'S REALLY THE HEART OF MODERN RETELLING OF SOMETIMES CALLED LEAN RETELLING. WHERE YOU HAVE ON ONE HAND ON ONE SIDE OF THAT BIG BUILDING TRUCKS COMING IN OF FROM SUPPLIERS BRINGING GOODS OF THAT ARE DESTINED FOR THE STORES OF THAT RETAILER? IN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DISTRIBUTION CENTER. AT WHAT'S CALLED THE CROSS DOCKING FACILITY YOU ABOUT DOWN TRUCKS THAT WILL BE DESTINED TO SPECIFIC. US STORES WITH SPECIFIC DELIVERIES. THE CHANGE THAT HAPPENED IN RETAILING IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES REALLY LED BY WALMART BUT SPREADING ACROSS ENTIRE INDUSTRY WAS TO CHANGE WHAT WAS USED TO BE CALLED THE WAREHOUSE INTO A DISTRIBUTION CENTER. WHERE YOU HAVE INCOMING SHIPMENTS OF GOODS YOU CAN SEE IN THE LOWER? HERE ARE COMING IN. ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS HIGHLY AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES WHERE THOSE GOODS ARE UNLOADED USUALLY FROM TRUCK SOMETIMES FROM CONTAINERS. BY MANUAL LABOR BUT THEN QUIT ON AUTOMATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTROLLED SYSTEMS THAT MOVE THOSE GOOD SOMETIMES WITHIN THREE MINUTES TO OUTGOING DOCKS WHERE AGAIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TELLS. THE THE SYSTEM EXACTLY WHICH STORE THAT DELIVERY SHOULD GO TO. POT SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF MANUAL WORK ON THE INCOMING DECK A LOT OF MANUAL WORK ON THE OUTGOING DECK AND THEN VERY ADVANCED AUTOMATED SYSTEMS. UP THAT WHOLE SYSTEM WORKS BECAUSE RETAILERS HAVE VERY SPECIFIC HIGHLY TECHNICAL STANDARDS THAT THEY NEED EVERYONE TO MAKE WHETHER IT'S THE SUPPLIER OR THE TRUCK DRIVERS WHO WERE COMING IN AND OUT OF THE FACILITIES. AND THOSE STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS ARE DICTATED BY THE BUSINESS STRATEGIES OF COMPANIES WE KNOW WELL LIKE WALMART AND AND. AMAZON. NOW WHAT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS IS WHO DOES THAT WORK AND WHERE AS ONCE THE STORY I JUST DESCRIBED EVERYONE IN THE IN THE FACILITY WHERE EMPLOYEES OF THE RETAILER. OF THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE. SOMEWHERE IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES A MAJOR RETAILER STARTED TO SAY WELL LET'S HAVE SOMEONE ELSE RUN THOSE FACILITIES FOR US LET'S HIRE COMPANIES LIKE SCHNEIDER LOGISTICS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR GLOBAL PLAYERS IN THIS. AREA. TO RUN IT BY OUR SPEX TO OUR STANDARDS AND WILL BE PENALIZED AND PAID BASED ON THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT BUT IT'S THEIR PROBLEM TO ACTUALLY RUN. EMPLOYEE THE PEOPLE PAY THE PEOPLE AND SO ON. THAT'S LEVEL ONE OF FEATURING BUT THAT'S NOT WHERE IT STOPPED LEVEL TO A FEATURING HAS BEEN. THAT WAS WORK FORCES ARE INCREASINGLY NOT THE EMPLOYEES OF THE THIRD PARTY LOGISTICS OPENING THE THIRD PARTY LOGISTICS COMPANY GOES OUT AND HIRES STAFFING AGENCY. AND THOSE WORKERS ARE PAID BY THE STAFFING AGENCY AND SOMETIMES HE IT THE FILTERING GOES UN ONE FURTHER LEVEL WHERE THE STAFFING AGENCY PAYS THOSE WORKERS AS IF THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS IF THEY'RE NOT EVEN THEIR EMPLOYEES BUT THEY'RE BEING PAID ON A PIECE RATE BASIS. UMP THAT'S WHERE WHEN I WAS IN MY WAGE AN HOUR HAD WE OFTEN FOUND FLAGRANT VIOLATIONS OF NOT ONLY OVER TIME IN JUST THE BASIC IDEA THAT YOU SHOULD PAY PEOPLE FOR WORK. BUT EVEN THE MINIMUM WAGE WOULD BE VIOLATED IN THOSE SETTINGS. AND SO THAT'S THE FEATURED WORKPLACE WHERE YOU HAVE STILL THE COMPANY THAT WE ALL KNOW DICTATING ALL THE STANDARD SICKO WINE. BUT THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP BROKEN APART INTO MULTIPLE PIECES. AND THAT'S THE STORY WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU UP TILL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO. BUT THIS FEATURING STORY HAS FEATURED FURTHER. AND AGAIN JUST TO UNDERSCORE AND SOMETHING THAT LINKS THE DISCUSSION THAT I'M I'M PUTTING ON THE TABLE WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR MORE ABOUT. IN IN OTHER SESSIONS. THE USE OF UBER TYPE PLATFORM ECONOMIES TO CHANGE THIS EVEN FURTHER. AND WHAT I WOULD NOW JUST POINT NOW IS THAT INSTEAD OF THE SYSTEMS TRYING TO BRING GOODS TO PHYSICAL STORES. IT'S NOW THE GAME IS TO GET GOODS DIRECTLY FOR HOME DELIVERY WHETHER THAT IS. SOFT GOODS A KIND OF THINGS WE BY WALMART OR GROCERIES. AND ONCE AGAIN THAT IS BEING DONE BY USING A NETWORK OF BROKEN APART EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIPS SO WHAT RETAILERS AND TYPICALLY COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON ARE NOW DOING IS USING AN INTERMEDIARY SET UP. WANT SOMETIMES SINGLE CONTRACTOR SOMETIMES MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS. TO PICK UP THOSE GOODS. AND THEN ROUTE THEM TO A NETWORK OF CARS. AND WHERE THE CARS ARE MUCH LIKE WE SEE IN PLATFORM TRANSPORTATION ARE BEING OWNED AND OPERATED BY INDIVIDUALS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS EVEN THOUGH THOSE COULD BILL WAS THERE THEIR MOVEMENT THERE IT COMPENSATION THEIR TIING THEIR STANDARDS ARE ALL STILL DICTATED BY THE. BEAT THE RETAILER AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE EVEN MORE SO IN THIS MODERN SYSTEM OF RETAILING. IS. A MODELING OF WHO IS THE EMPLOYER. THE MINUTE YOU CREATE I'M TRAINED IN ECONOMICS AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ALMOST AXIOMATIC THAT IF YOU BREAK APART. BUG OUT A MARKET IN THE MULTIPLE PIECES EVERYONE ASK TO GET THEIR PROFIT. AND THAT MEANS WHAT'S LEFT AT THE BOTTOM GET SMALLER AND SMALLER AND IN PARTICULAR IF THE ONLY THING YOU HAVE LEFT TO CONTROL. ARE YOUR LABOR COSTS ARE UNFORTUNATELY IT'S WORKING PEOPLE WHO BEAR THE RISK OF THESE THESE CHANGES. AND SO THE TRANSFORMATION THAT I I'VE JUST OUTLINED TO YOU HAS RIPPLED ACROSS OUR ECONOMY. I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS OF THE SLIDE BUT I'LL JUST SIMPLY TELL YOU. THAT A ONE OF THE TWO OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED LABOR ECONOMISTS IN THIS FIELD HAVE ESTIMATED. THAT NINETY FOUR PERCENT. NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF NET EMPLOYMENT GROWTH IN THIS ECONOMY FROM TWO THOUSAND FIVE TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. A ROSE FROM THESE KINDS OF RELATIONSHIPS THAT VIRTUALLY ALL THE NET NEW JOBS CREATED WERE IN THE FORM OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING ON CALL WORKERS TEMPORARY HELP STAFFING AGENCIES. OR WORKERS PROVIDED BY SOME OTHER KIND OF CONTRACT FIRM A THAT'S A LEVEL OF GROWTH OF IT TYPE OF WORK PRACTICE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THIS ECONOMY. I IN MY MIND EVER AND IT'S IN THAT CONTEXT THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND AS I SAY THAT THE FUTURE OF WORKERS HERE. THE LAST POINT BY I WOULD MAKE IN CLOSING IS THAT. EVERYTHING I'VE JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU HAS BEEN MADE BY THE CONSCIOUS CHOICES OF BUSINESSES MAKING DECISIONS OFTEN BECAUSE OF INTENSE PRESSURES THEY FACED FROM CAPITAL MARKETS FROM PRIVATE AND PUBLIC CAPITAL MARKETS. WHO HAVE FORCED COMPANIES INCREASINGLY TO FOCUS ON CORE COMPETENCIES AND FIND WAYS TO REDUCE OUR COSTS? THESE ARE CHOICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THESE ARE CHOICES THAT SOMETIMES. CUT AGAINST THE GRAIN OF OUR BASIC STRUCTURE OF STANDARDS. AND AS A RESULT OF THAT. HAVE NOT ONLY SHIFTED A LOT OF THE COSTS OF THESE PRACTICES ON TO WORKING PEOPLE ARE BUT ALSO REQUIRE US TO RETHINK OUR WHOLE APPROACH TO REGULATING THE LABOR MARKET. THANK YOU. CONDUCT DAVID THOUGHT DAVID MISTER WHILE. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE PRESENCE OF SENATOR WACHOWSKI I WILL HEAR ARE FROM DR BERNARD BUT DID YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS SIR. OKAY THANK YOU I'M WILL COME BACK WITH QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF YOU NUMBER PLEASE NOW HAVE GOT THE BURKHARDT. A WONDERFUL WELL GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU THE CHAIR IS. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT OF THE TWO COMMITTEES AND STAFF. I AM VERY HONORED TO BE HERE TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND TO SHARE WHAT. WE AT THE LABOR CENTER AND WITH OUR ALLIES HAVE FIGURED OUT AROUND WHETHER THE ROBOTS ARE COMING IN WHETHER WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN APOCALYPSE OR NOT. BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PAIRING ON THIS PANEL OF THE TWO OF US. I THINK IT'S VERYEASY AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHEN YOU DIVE INTO THE NEW TECHNOLOGY DEBATES TO GET TUNNEL VISION AND TO THINK IT'S ALL GOING TO BE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE DAVID'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE IS A NUMBER OF LONG TERM TRENDS HERE IN THE LABOR MARKET AND TECHNOLOGY WILL INCREASINGLY BE PART OF THOSE TRENDS BUT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ISSUE. THAT SAID IT IS A BIG ISSUE AND. I. I THINK WE ARE AT A DIFFERENT POINT NOW THAN WE WERE A YEAR AGO I THINK A YEAR AGO AND THE RESEARCH AND POLICY DEBATES WE WERE STILL VERY MUCH IN THIS MODE OF. WE ARE GOING TO HAVE MASSIVE JOB LOSS IN THE U. S. YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THE STATISTICS YOU KNOW FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF JOBS WILL BE LOST IN THE U. S.. I THINK NOW WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE DUE IN PART TO REALLY GREAT RESEARCH BY MCKINSEY. AND I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF TOP LINES HERE I THINK THAT CURRENT RESEARCH IS SUGGESTING THAT WE ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE MASSIVE JOB DISPLACEMENT IN THE NEAR AND MEDIUM TERM. WE CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT STUDY DURING DISCUSSION. BUT THEY DO ESTIMATED THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE U. S. WILL HAVE ENOUGH JOB GROWTH. AT LEAST AT TWENTY THIRTY AND SO TO ME THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES. NOT THAT ONE IS NOT WORKING. WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE QUALITY OF THE JOBS? OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND HOWARD THESE CHANGES GOING TO IMPACT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IMMIGRANT WORKERS WOMEN IT CETERA. AND IF THAT'S THE QUESTION THEN I THINK. OUR PUBLIC POLICY HEARING CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE PRO INNOVATION ABSOLUTELY BUT WE HAVE TO PUT WORKERS AND IMPACTED COMMUNITIES. AT THE CENTER OF THE DISCUSSION. LET ME TO SHOW YOU A COUPLE MORE SLIDES HERE. I'M JUST I'M TRYING TO TURN DOWN PER YOUR SUGGESTION. IF WE ARE NOT LOOKING OTHER ROBOTS APOCALYPSE THIS IS THE GRAPH I THINK WE HAVE TO CARRY WITH US OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN SO THIS GRAPH SHOWS THE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY IN THE U. S SINCE THE WORK POST WORLD WAR TWO ERA. AND IT SHOWS THE GROWTH IN HOURLY COMPENSATION IE WAGES AND I'M SURE YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN THIS GRAPH BEFORE STARTING IN THE MID SEVENTIES THAT SOCIAL CONTRACT BROKE APART. AND OUR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS WERE NOT SHARED WITH WORKERS. AND THE REASON I FLAG THIS IS BECAUSE AMONG ECONOMISTS AND A LOT OF POLICYMAKERS THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT ECONOMIC GROWTH IN THE U. S. GOING FORWARD. PEOPLE REALLY ARE I'M ARE FOCUSED ON ARE WE GONNA HAVE ENOUGH PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AND SO YOU WILL SEE ARGUMENTS AND I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD THIS. THAT WE SHOULD BE AYE INVESTING EVEN MUCH MORE THAN WE ARE NOW IN NEW TECHNOLOGY TO GET THE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH SO THAT OUR ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW. AND BUT I WOULD SAY IS WE CANNOT HAVE THAT DEBATE WITHOUT ALSO FOCUSING ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE GAMES. OTHERWISE I THINK THE DEFAULT WILL BE THERE'S A THERE'S SEVERAL ECONOMISTS WHO ARE ARGUING THAT NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL JUST SERVE TO EXACERBATE INEQUALITY. IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ELSE SO JUST FOCUSING ON PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH IN MY MIND IS NOT ENOUGH AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS AN EITHER OR LIKE YOU GUYS HAVE HAVE MENTIONED IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. I THINK THERE IS A WAY WE CAN HAVE PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH NEW TECHNOLOGY AND. SHARE IT WITH WORKERS. HERE IS. A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES I HAVE OF. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO TO ALL OF THEM BUT I WILL FLAG AND THIS IS COMING FROM NEW RESEARCH THAT WE ARE COMMISSIONING WE HAVE COMMISSIONED A SERIES OF INDUSTRY STUDIES AROUND THE LIKELY IMPACTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN YOU ALL HAVE HEARD A LOT ABOUT LONG HAUL TRUCKING IN THE COMING ABOUT TIME LIMITS TRUCKS AND HOW WOULD THEY LIKE LEAD TO DISPLACE THREE MILLION LONG HAUL TRUCKERS THESE ARE THE GUYS WHO MOVE STUFF ON THE HIGHWAYS. OUR RESEARCH IS SUGGESTING THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY THOUGH ALSO SEE A GROWTH IN TRUCKING JOBS IN SHORT HAUL TRUCKING AND PRECISELY BECAUSE OF THE GOODNESS OF TO ONLINE RETAIL IN THE GROWTH OF WAREHOUSES. WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT MORE. FOLKS MOVING STUFF BETWEEN WAREHOUSES AND FULFILLMENT CENTERS AND THEN TO CONSUMERS AND THE KEY QUESTION IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE QUALITY OF THOSE JOBS. THAT SHORT HAUL TRUCKING JOB IS NOW IN THE TOP TEN LIST ON MONSTER DOT COM IN TERMS OF JOB OPENINGS BUT YOU CAN. IMAGINE THAT ONE OF THE DEFAULT SCENARIOS WILL BE THAT THESE WILL BE GIG JOBS. THAT THEY WILL BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEY WILL PICK UP SHORT PACKAGE DELIVERY IN MOVEMENT BETWEEN WAREHOUSES BUT THIS IS NOT INEVITABLE. AND I THINK THE QUESTION FOR US IS POLICYMAKERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. IS WHAT ARE WE GOING TO ASK OF THE WAREHOUSES WHEN THEY COME INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. CAN WE IMAGINE THE THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE NEW TRUCKING JOBS WILL ACTUALLY BE EMPLOYEES AND THAT THEY WILL BE AND HOUSE JOBS RIGHT AND WE CAN MAKE THAT DECISION WE CAN MAKE THAT FUTURE. ON THE OTHER END OF THE SPECTRUM SORT OF MORE IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES. I'M HOPEFUL STORIES IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE THAT. HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR AWHILE. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE ACTUALLY HAVE A REALLY INTERESTING EXAMPLE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETTER WITH KAISER. AND SO AS YOU KNOW KAISER IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND IN THE COUNTRY. AND HAS A LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP AND THAT LABOR MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP DOES A LOT OF DELIBERATIONS BETWEEN KAISER AND ITS UNIONS ABOUT HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO IMPACT WORKERS IN THE WORKPLACE. AND IN FACT MY UNDERSTANDING IS KAISER. WHEN THEY IMPLEMENTED ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS THEY WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR WORKERS IN WITH THEIR UNIONS AND IT IS WIDELY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS. AND THERE'S A LOT OF BAD EXAMPLES AS YOU GUYS PROBABLY KNOW SO IN MY MIND THAT IS THE VISION THAT WE WANT AND I THINK IN IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE EXAMPLES THAT WE CAN DRAW ON. WHERE WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS ITSELF OF IMPLEMENTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES? AND SO I LEAVE YOU WOULD. I AM NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS. THIS IS OUR GRADE THAT WE ARE USING RIGHT NOW TO IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE WE NEED PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND WE CAN GO BACK TO THIS IF WE WANT. I'D I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WE HAVE VERY LITTLE RIGHT NOW THAT FOLKS HAVE DEVELOPED IN TERMS OF POLICY RESPONSES WHEN IT COMES TO DISPLACEMENT OR OR EDUCATION AND TRAINING AT CETERA. I THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT WE DO POLICY MAKING IN THIS AREA ON AN AD HOC BASIS. OR IN SORT OF WHACK A MOLE FORM AND SO I THINK WE HAVE SOME ON RAMP TIME HERE RIGHT THIS IS NOT ALL HAPPENING TOMORROW. LET US FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE VISION THAT WE HAVE A WHAT WE WANT TECHNOLOGY TO DO AND LET'S ASK BIG QUESTIONS THAT WILL PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR PUBLIC POLICY ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO HERE ARE SOME BIG QUESTIONS. WHAT WOULD IT TWENTY FIRST CENTURY EDUCATION TRAINING AND SAFETY NET SYSTEM LOOK LIKE? HOW DO WE ENSURE OUR ECONOMY GROWS GOOD JOBS AND IN MY MIND WHERE WORKERS WORK ALONGSIDE AND WOOD TECHNOLOGY? REDUCE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND ESPECIALLY RACE AND GENDER BIAS? AND THEN PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT WHAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EMPLOYERS IN ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS AND IN PARTICULAR THE TECH SECTOR. THERE ARE MANY MORE QUESTIONS LIKE THIS BUT I THINK THE USE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SHOULD BE THE STARTING PLACE BEFORE WE DIVE INTO SORT OF THE MY MUSHA. OF SPECIFIC PIECES OF PUBLIC POLICY. THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR GIVING US KIND OF A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW. WILL TURN TO. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I GUESS THAT'LL BE ME FOR NOW. YOU KNOW I I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM EITHER OF YOU HOW YOU VIEW. HOW SHOULD WE BE GOING FORWARD ABOUT THIS CONVERSATION? ABOUT WHERE AUTOMATION IS HEADED UP AS A AS A CHAIR OF THE LABOR COMMITTEE. I VIEW MY NUMBER ONE JOB TO LOOK OUT FOR THE INTERESTS OF WORKING PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND. THE FOLKS IN LABOR OUR PARTNERS FOR THAT REASON BOB WE HAVE OTHER PARTNERS TO. WE HAVE PARTNERS WE HEAR FROM TODAY IN THE IN THE TECH SECTOR WHO WILL TALK ABOUT WHERE INNOVATION EXISTS. TO THE DEGREE THAT WE CAN HOW DO WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD THAT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS ON BUT WHAT SHOULD WE BE TALKING ABOUT WHERE ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE. DESPITE WHAT YOU SAID DR I I YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WE HEAR IS ALL THESE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE LOST AND AND AND AND YOUR DATA SUGGESTS. DIFFERENT PHENOMENA. I IN I HAVE TO SAY THIS IS A SPACE THAT I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD OCCUR. WHEN I HEARD PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT. THE YOU KNOW AUTOMATION I THOUGHT ABOUT CARTOONS I WATCHED AS A KID WHERE THEY WERE ROBOTS DOING THINGS FOR PEOPLE AND THEN THE NEXT THING I HEARD THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE EIGHTEEN WHEELERS THAT WERE SOFT DRIVING. TRUCKS DOING LONG HALLS AND SO CLEARLY THE TECHNOLOGY IS HERE HAS ARRIVED OF FROM YOUR STANDPOINT HOW WHAT CONVERSATION SHOULD WE BE HAVING GOING FORWARD. AS A LABOR COMMUNITY TECHNOLOGY A COMPANY'S BUSINESS TOGETHER OF MOVING FOR. NOW I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I JUST WANNA MAKE REALLY SURE I AM NOT PAINTING A ROSY PICTURE HERE. SO. JUST BECAUSE I'M SAYING RESURGENT RIGHT NOW IS SUGGESTING WE ARE NOT GONNA HAVE AN IMMINENT ROBOTS APOCALYPSE WE KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS. WE WILL NEED TO RETRAIN WORKERS ON THE JOB WE WILL WE WILL NEED TO FIND NEW JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO TOTALLY LOSE OUR JOBS ALTOGETHER THERE IS A REAL. POLICY CHALLENGE HERE AND WE CAN NAVIGATE WE CAN GO THROUGH THIS. NEXT TRANSITION. IN A PAINFUL WAY OR WE CAN DO IN WAYS THAT TAKE CARE OF WORKERS SIDE I DON'T PAINT TOO ROSY A PICTURE. I THINK THERE'S TWO PIECES HERE ONE IS. WE NEED TO BE INVESTING AND WE CAN PARTNER WE SHOULD BE PARTNERING WITH YOU WHILE WE NEED TO BE INVESTING AND THE TYPE OF. REALLY CONCRETE RESEARCH INTO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE IN THE NEAR AND MEDIUM TERM I THINK WE HAVE REACHED DOES SORT OF THE. LIMITS OF WHAT THE SORT OF MACKENZIE TYPE STUDIES CAN TEACH US THEIR VERY AGGREGATE VERY HIGH LEVEL. I THINK IN ORDER FOR YOU ALL TO ACT AND IN ORDER FOR UNIONS TO ACT WE NEED TO KNOW LIKE IN THE GROCERY STORE INDUSTRY WHAT ARE THE THREE TRENDS WEARS JOB GROWTH LIKELY TO BE. WHERE WE GONNA LOSE IT WHERE ARE OUR LEVERAGE POINTS RIGHT AND SO THAT IS WHY WE HAVE INVESTED IN THAT TYPE OF RESEARCH AND THIS IS GOING TO BE AN ON GOING? BY NEED FOR MORE AND MORE INFORMATION FROM THE FIELD. AND THEN I WOULD SAY SECOND. WE HAD A VERY INTERESTING A VISIT FROM A DELEGATION FROM DENMARK. TWO WEEKS AGO AND I WILL SHARE WITH YOU THAT IN EUROPE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE E. U. MEMBER COUNTRIES HAS A NATIONAL. INITIATIVE TRIPARTITE WITH EMPLOYERS GOVERNMENT AND UNIONS AT THE TABLE TO BEGIN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORK. FOR TO FIND AREAS OF COMMON INTEREST AND TO BEGIN TO PUT UP PLAN ACTUAL PROGRAMMING. AND IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT THE U. S. DOES NOT HAVE A PROCESS LIKE THAT I THINK THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN AT THE STATE LEVEL FRANKLY. AND YOU KNOW I'M WAY AS WARY AS ANYBODY ELSE OF PUTTING TOGETHER A NEW BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION BUT AS YOU SAID THIS DOES HAVE TO START WITH A JOINT ONVERSATION WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AT THE TABLE. AND I AM HAPPY TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE BLUEPRINTS OF WHAT COUNTRIES LIKE DENMARK AND GERMANY ARE DOING GERMANY LAUNCH RT THREE YEARS AGO WHAT THEY CALL THEIR INDUSTRY FOUR POINT. INITIATIVE AND THEY ARE VERY INTENT ON MAKING SURE THAT THEIR COUNTRY IS A LEADER IN ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGY. IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT. AND UP DISPLACING AND HURTING A LOT OF WORKERS DAY RT SEVERAL YEARS AHEAD OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE U. S. IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND SO WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SHARE SOME OF THOSE MODELS WITH YOU IN THINKING THAT THROUGH. I WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU. MISTER WHILE COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE TYPES OF. JOBS THAT YOU SEE BEING TREATED AS A RESULT. OF AUTOMATION PEOPLE KEEP SAYING THEY'RE GOING TO BE ALL THESE JOBS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. TO SERVICE IF YOU WILL. YOU KNOW THE EQUIPMENT THE TECHNOLOGY. IN YOUR RESEARCH HAVE YOU FOUND THAT TO BE THE CASE IN THE SO OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE. OR IS THAT SOMETHING WHERE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PHD AND I ENGINEERING. TO DISSIPATE. WELL I I THINK THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION. COMES TO A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE OF. IT'S A CHOICE IT'S HOW WE STRUCTURE JOBS IN THE FUTURE. ARE BASED ON THE CHOICES THAT EMPLOYERS MAKE THAT PUBLIC POLICIES DIRECT US TOWARDS BED. HAVING PEOPLE ARE HAVING ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UNIONS. AND WORKER REPRESENTATIVES AT THE TABLE WILL AFFECT. YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD GO BACK TO WHAT SORT OF YOUR FIRST QUESTION IN AND THINKING ABOUT THE QUESTION YOU JUST ASKED ME. THERE IS ALWAYS THIS TEMPTATION. AMONG BOTH ECONOMISTS. AND TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT THESE CHANGES AS IF THEY ARE FORCES OF NATURE THAT THEY ARE ON ALL TERRIBLE AND THAT SORT OF. GET OVER IT THIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD IS ORGANIZED. MARKETS MOVE IN CERTAIN WAYS BECAUSE OF ECONOMIC FORCES BUT THEY ARE STEERED BY SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE STEERED BY GOVERNMENT POLICIES ARE STEERED BY WHO SITTING AT THE TABLE WHEN THOSE CHOICES ARE MADE. AND SO. I THOUGHT ANNETTA GAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE THAT BUILDS ON THE EXAMPLE I PUT ON A UP ON. ON THE CHART. THERE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE CHANGES THAT WILL ARISE FROM THE AUTOMATION OF TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. BUT THERE IS THE SECONDARY PROBLEM WE'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO GET PACKAGES TO PEOPLE'S DOORS WERE PROBABLY GOING TO BE RELYING ON HUMAN BEINGS FOR THAT FOR QUITE SOMETIME. HOW THOSE JOBS ARE DESIGNED? IS VERY MUCH GOING TO BE A FUNCTION OF HOW WE THINK ABOUT WHO WE HAVE AT THE TABLE WHAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS OF EMPLOYERS ABOUT HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE TREATING THAT WORKFORCE. ITEM AND THAT WILL THEN RIPPLE OUT TO HOW MUCH OF THE ENORMOUS GAINS SAID ARE BEING ENJOYED BY SOME OF OUR HIGH TECH COMPANIES WILL BE SHARED BY THEIR LABOR FORCE HOW MUCH WILL BE SHARED BY THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. HOW MUCH OF THE RISK? THE RISK THAT WORKING PEOPLE FACE THAT HISTORICALLY WE ASK EMPLOYERS TO HELP THEM WITH THAT RISK AND WE HAD PUBLIC POLICIES LIKE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. TO CUSHION THOSE RISKS HOW MUCH OF THOSE RISK WILL BE SHIFTED ONTO WORKING PEOPLE RIGHT NOW WE ARE UNFORTUNATELY DRIFTING INTO A SYSTEM. WHERE THE IMPACTS OF SOME OF THE AUTOMATION CHANGES HERE ASKING ABOUT? AND THE DOCTOR BERNHARDT DESCRIBED ARE GOING TO RESULT IN TWO RISKS BORN BY WORKING PEOPLE AND HAVING A. WORSE AND WORSE SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND GAINING LESS AND LESS OF THE VALUE THEIR CREATING IN THE FORM OF WAGES. BUT AGAIN I GO BACK TO THE PREMISE WHICH IS THAT SOCIAL CHOICE RIGHT NOW THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE LEFT OPEN CERTAIN SOCIAL POLICIES ABOUT WHO IS AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. REALLY TO BE DECIDED BY. A EMPLOYERS AND DECIDED IN THE BREACH RATHER THAN HAVING. PURPOSIVE PUBLIC POLICIES THAT REALLY MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT PROTECTIONS WE WANNA HAVE OF WORKING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN AND THEN LETTING BUSINESSES MAKE DECISIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT. AM I GUESS YOU KNOW I'VE TAUGHT THOUSANDS OF BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDENTS. BUSINESS SCHOOL STUDENTS AND PEOPLE IN THEM IN IN IN THE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR PRETTY CLEVER. THEY'LL FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MAKE PROFITS WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF CLEARLY DEFINED LAWS AND EXPECTATIONS THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE NEED THAT SOMETIMES OUTSIDE THOSE BOUNDARIES ARE AND NOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY. I WOULD HEAR THE LABOR PERSPECTIVES ONE FINAL QUESTION REALLY ALONG THESE LINES YOU BOTH REFERENCE. THIS SOCIAL CHOICE IN THAT THERE BE THE STRUCTURE SORT OF CREATING EXPECTATIONS AND GUIDELINES FOR HOW THE FUTURE OF WORK PROCEEDS. IT YOU KNOW OUR THEIR EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT YOU CAN POINT TO OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IN MY EXPERIENCE. INNOVATORS CREATE. THEY DON'T CONSULT GOVERNMENT TO SAY WHAT RAGS WILL WE BE YOU KNOW PASSED TO FOLLOW. GOVERNMENT TYPICALLY. REGULATES AFTER THE FACT LE. INNOVATIONS GET CREATED AND THEN GOVERNMENT HEARS ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE GOOD AND SOMETIMES NOT GOOD AND THEN GOVERNMENT TRIES TO TREAT THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HOPEFULLY WILL SUPPORT BUSINESS. AND PROTECT THE WORKERS OF THOSE BUSINESS AT THE SAME TIME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE WORK WILL MOVE FORWARD BEFORE GOVERNMENT IS IN A POSITION TO REALLY SET THOSE GUIDELINES ARE THERE OTHER STRUCTURES THAT. EXIST NOW THAT YOU SEE DOING JUST THAT. AND SO. HI HOW ARE YOU. I DON'T WANNA GIVE I DO WANT TO GIVE UP THE IDEA THAT WE AS. GOVERNMENT CAN ACT QUICKLY ENOUGH. TO BEGIN TO SET UP THOSE STRUCTURES. I THINK ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOVERNANCE IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE WHERE. IN THE TECH IN THE TECH SECTOR ITSELF I'M EVEN HEADS OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE STARTING TO SAY WE NEED A FRAMEWORK FOR ETHICS ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RIGHT. AND HAVE ALREADY CREATED THEIR OWN STRUCTURES LIKE THE PARTNERSHIP ON A AYE. I THINK WE SHOULD BE MOVING QUICKLY TO SAY ACTUALLY THAT SPACE. FOR TALKING ABOUT WHAT ARE THE GOALS OF TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT WE OPTIMIZING FOR THAT SHOULD BE BASED IN GOVERNMENT AND I HAVE SEEN SOME INTERESTING BECAUSE IN THE UK FOR ESTABLISHING A GOVERNMENT BASED. OVERSIGHT. A STRUCTURE THAT DOES INCLUDE THE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THEMSELVES. BUT WHERE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE THAT'S DOING THE CONVENING ON RAISING THE QUESTIONS ABOUT. TO WHAT ND AND SO I JUST WANTED TO RAISE THAT UP. IN PART AS A SECOND ANSWERED TO THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. WE. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHO WILL BEAR THE RISK I THINK WE SHOULD BE ASKING TO WHAT AND. AND WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY WANT TECHNOLOGY TO DO. IN THE ENGINEERING WORLD THEY CALL THIS THE AUGMENTATION VERSES AUTOMATION DECISION THERE IS A DESIGN CHOICE HERE AYE WE'D JUST DEVELOPING AND DESIGNING TECHNOLOGIES JUST TO REDUCE COSTS JUST TO REDUCE EFFICIENCY. AND THEREFORE OFTEN RESULTING DISPLACED WORKERS OR ARE WE GOING TO DESIGN TECHNOLOGY TO AUGMENT WORKERS I MAKE THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE BUT THEY ARE STILL ON THE JOB THIS IS NOT LIKE A SORT OF A PIPE DREAM RIGHT THIS COMES DOWN TO AT THE POINT IN THE LABS. WHAT ARE YOU CONCEIVABLE OF WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT MANUFACTURING ARE YOU GOING TO LEVERAGE THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN EXPERIENCED WORK ON THE FLOOR? AND SURROUND THAT WORKER WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY OR YOU GONNA MAKE THAT WORKER OBSOLETE AYE THING IN INDUSTRY AFTER INDUSTRY THAT IS THE KEY FIRST DECISION DEBT WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT. HOW TO CIVIC SOCIETY AND HOW DOES LABOR AND HOW DO WORKERS HAVE AN INPUT ON BECAUSE THE AUTOMATION ROUTE YOU KNOW PATH IS NOT INEVITABLE IN MOST CASES? IF YOU ARE ABLE TO WE LIKE YOU TO STAY A TO HEAR FROM OUR LABOR PERSPECTIVES FROM OUR BUSINESS PERSPECTIVES. ITEM WE'RE GONNA SEGUE TO THE LABOR. PROSPECTUS PANEL PART OF THE PANEL BUT. WE'RE WE'RE HONORED THAT WE HAVE. THE SENATE CHAIR OF LABOR HERE AND THAT WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME HIM A IN HIS NEW OF ROLE I'M EXCITED TO HAVE HIM AS A PARTNER WE DON'T NORMALLY DO THIS BUT WE CAN APPLAUD IN THIS HOUSE FOR A NEW SENATE LABOR CHAIR. THANK YOU SO MUCH I CHAIR THURMAN FOR THAT. TRADUCTION AND DIED I'M THRILLED TO BE HERE AS THE NEW CHAIR OF. LABOR DUST RELATIONS THROUGH THE US STATE SENATE. I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS HEARING WHICH WAS READY UP BEING ORGANIZED UP BEFORE WE CAME CHAIR IS BEING HELD A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE NEED O BE LOOKING. DEL TOWARD THE FUTURE AND WHERE. WHERE WE'RE GOING AND ALSO ENSURING THAT? THAT. WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE. WORK FORCE AND THAT THAT WORK FORCES IS READY FOR FOR THIS FUTURE AND I THINK THERE ARE DECISIONS TO BE MADE BOTH POLICY DESIGN OTHER DECISIONS TO BE MADE AS WELL AS I APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO. HEARING. AS MANY OF THE TEST FIRES I APOLOGIZE BEFORE I KNEW WAS LABOR CHAIR AT A FULL SCHEDULE ALREADY. SCHEDULED TODAY BUT I'M PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO TO LEAST MAKE SOMETIME TO BE UP TO SPEED AT LEAST IN PART OF THIS HEARING AND I LOOK FORWARD AGAIN WORKING WITH THAT WITH CHAIRED THURMAN'S WELL AS A. AS A STRONG PARTNER BEING SURE THAT. WE. FIGHT FOR THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE SO THANK YOU THINK STRUCTURE HAVE YEAH I THINK OUT OF OUR PRESENTERS HERE FOR FOR BEING HERE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT WE WILL NOW HEAR SOME LABOR PERSPECTIVES WE HAVE A A FEW PANELISTS THAT TO COME FORWARD REPRESENTING. OF THE TEAMSTERS AND HE LEADS OF THE TEAM SERVICE THROUGHOUT ALL OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE DUBBED BLOCK. REPRESENTING THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS. THAT THE WESTERN STATES COUNCIL WE HAVE JIM LEHRER BE. REPRESENTING SEIU WE HAVE T. OR. WILL BE OUR PRESENTERS. WELCOME AND. WE ARE READY WHENEVER YOU ARE THE SABAKI ELECTED LEADERS ARE. THANK YOU. AND BEFORE I START TO CESAR DE HAS FROM THE BUILDING TRADES. SENSES APOLOGIES HE WAS A FELLOW PANELISTS BUT HE STUCK IN COMMITTEE BUT HE WANTED TO BE HERE THIS MORNING. I AM SO GOOD MORNING CHAIRS THURMAN AND PAN. AS WAS SAID MY NAME'S DOUG BLOCK AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS. FROM BAKERSFIELD UP TO THE OREGON BORDER. AND FOR PURPOSES OF TODAY'S DISCUSSION I WANT TO FOCUS MOSTLY ON OUR MEMBERS WHO DRIVE TRUCKS. BUSES TRAINS AND ARE DOING PACKAGE DELIVERY. WHO ARE VULNERABLE TO AUTOMATION? THIS ISSUE IS SO IMPORTANT TO OUR UNION AND THAT IN THE MIDST OF ALL MY OTHER DUTIES AND SPENDING MORE THAN HALF MY TIME ON IT. SO I WANNA THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING. ALSO MONO EXPRESSED MY DEEP DISAPPOINTMENT THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ARE NOT HERE. BECAUSE THIS IS RIGHT UP HERE WITH RIGHT TO WORK AS AN EXACT STANSHALL THREAT FOR OUR UNION. I HAVE. TRAVEL ON THIS ISSUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SILICON VALLEY HE HERE. TO WASHINGTON DC. AND EVERYWHERE I GO I HEAR TALK ABOUT THIS ROBOT APOCALYPSE THAT HAS BEEN ALLUDED TO. ESTIMATES OF UP TO FOUR MILLION WORKERS IN TRANSPORTATION SECTOR THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR JOBS IN THIS COUNTRY IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TWENTY YEARS. I DON'T BUY IT. COURSE THE TEMPTATION IS TO COME HERE THIS MORNING AND SAY. WE'RE GOING TO STAKE OUT A RIGHTEOUS POSITION AGAINST AUTOMATION AND TECHNOLOGY. AND WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU. AS LABOR ENDORSED DEMOCRATS TO JOIN US AS WE WAGE WAR AGAINST THE MACHINES. NOW YOU ALL REMEMBER THE LUDDITES RIGHT THESE WERE. TEXTILE WORKERS IN ENGLAND WHO DESTROYED THE WEAVING MACHINES DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION. THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FUN TO ME. BUT THAT. THE TEAMSTERS ARE NOT LUDDITES. BUT WE'RE ALSO NOT GONNA PLAY INTO ANY LINES FROM INDUSTRY INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES THAT WE ARE OUT TO STIFLE INNOVATION. IN FACT. THE WORK THAT THE TEAMSTERS ARE DOING AROUND THESE ISSUES IS TRULY INNOVATIVE. FOR WERE WORKING TO BUILD THE FUTURE WHERE TECHNOLOGY AUGMENTS JOBS DOESN'T AUTOMATE THEM. WHAT GOVERNMENT WRITES THE RULES TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED NOT JUST THE COMPANIES WHO ARE DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGY? AND WHERE TECHNOLOGY MAKES WORKERS JOB SAFER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE AND WHERE IT INCREASES THEIR EARNING POWER. NOW THIS MAY ALL SOUND PIE IN THE SKY SO LET ME GIVE YOU SOME REAL LIFE EXAMPLES AND SEEING IS ALL POLITICS ARE LOCAL MINI SKIRT AND SAN FRANCISCO. WHERE HAVE AN OFFICE? LAST YEAR ONE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PROPOSED A BAN ON PERSONAL DELIVERY ROBOTS. NOW WE WENT AND MET WITH ONE OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING THESE ROBOTS AND IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR. THAT THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD ACTUALLY HELP OUR MEMBERS WHO DO PACKAGE DELIVERY. INSTEAD OF PULLING UP TO A CURB AND BREAKING THEIR BACK STACKING BOXES AND LUGGING AROUND ON HAND TRUCKS. THEY COULD DROP A RAMP AND DISPATCH SEVERAL THESE ROBOTS TO DO REMOTE CONTROLLED DELIVERIES. THEREBY DELIVERING MORE AND DOING IT WITH LESS INJURIES. SO WE WORKED WITH THE SUPERVISOR TO AMEND THE LEGISLATION SO THAT COMPANIES CAN GET PERMITS TO TEST THESE ROBOTS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS. ONE THEY HAD TO BE ACTUALLY BASED IN SAN FRANCISCO. TO THEY HAD TO HAVE LABOR PEACE. MEANING THESE HAD TO BE COMPANIES THAT WERE CREATING. GOOD LOCAL UNION JOBS. AND WE WORKED OUT A DEAL WITH ONE OF THE MANUFACTURERS SO THAT WHEN THEY MOVE FROM THE TESTING IN TO THE MANUFACTURING AND DEPLOYMENT PHASE. THESE ROBOTS ARE GOING TO BE BUILT AND OPERATED BY TEAMSTERS. WE STARTED OUT AS A UNION OPERATING TEAMS OF HORSES WERE GOING TO BE OPERATING TEAMS OF ROBOTS. THAT'S INNOVATION TO ME. BACK HERE IN SACRAMENTO LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. AND A COMPANY CALLED PELOTON TECHNOLOGY ON A BILL CALLED AB SIX SIX NINE. THAT MADE SURE THAT WHEN PLATOONS OF TRUCKS ARE BEING TESTED IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE'S ONE TRUCK THAT'S WIRELESSLY CONTROLLING A CONVOY. THAT THERE'S A DRIVER WITH A COMMERCIAL DRIVER'S LICENSE IN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE TRUCKS. AND AFTER TESTIFYING IN ANOTHER COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE LAST MONTH I SPENT A LONG TIME WITH THE HEAD OF INNOVATION FOR VOLVO OF NORTH AMERICA. TALKING TO THEM AND THEY AGREED THAT IF YOU WANT TO DEVELOP NEW TRUCK TECHNOLOGY THE FIRST THING YOU SHOULD BE DOING IS ACTUALLY TALKING TO A PERSON WHO DRIVES A TRUCK. THE BILL. THIS IF THIS IS DONE RIGHT WITH YOUR HELP THIS COULD ACTUALLY BE GOOD FOR TRUCK DRIVERS IN INDIA AND THE INDUSTRY. BUT THAT BEING SAID NONE OF THESE COMPANIES CAME TO US OF THEIR OWN VOLITION. THEY CAME BECAUSE GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION BECAUSE YOU HELD HEARINGS BECAUSE YOU PROPOSED REGULATION AND LEGISLATION. AND WE NEED THAT SORT OF ACTION WE NEED LEADERSHIP. IF YOU DON'T A THE OTHER PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT THIS COULD GO A VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND LET ME TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT OTHER SCENARIO. THE INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES MY GAS ARE GONNA COME UP HERE AND TALK ABOUT. AVOIDING REGULATION. SO LET'S GO BACK TO THE DE. OF TRACKING IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. BEFORE THAT IT WAS A MIDDLE CLASS JOB THERE WERE SONGS ON THE RADIO WE SAW SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT IN THE MOVIE THEATERS HERE NOW. AFTER DEREGULATION AND THIS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MODEL ROSE OUT OF THE ASHES THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT. LOUDTHE TRUCKING COMPANIES TO OUTSOURCE. ALL THE COSTS AND RISKS OF TRUCKING ON THE BACKS OF THE WORKERS. AND OF COURSE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR IS TREATED AS A SMALL BUSINESS UNDER THE LAW AND CAN ORGANIZE A UNION. IN SHORT TIME TRUCKING WENT TO A JOB WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORKING SIXTY SEVENTY EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK. WITH NO BENEFITS NO SOCIAL SECURITY NO WORKERS COMP NO NOTHING MAKING LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR. THIS IS THE UBER AND LEFT MODEL. THERE'S NOTHING NEW ABOUT THIS THERE'S NOTHING INNOVATIVE THE ONLY THING THAT'S NEW IS THE TECHNOLOGY. AND SHORT OF BOLD ACTION ON YOUR PART THIS IS THE FUTURE OF WORK. AS IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT THEIR MAYBE ACTUALLY NET NEW JOBS IN IN LOGISTICS WORK AND SUPPLY CHAIN. DESPITE AUTOMATION DESPITE THE AMAZON A FACT. BUT IF YOU DON'T TAKE ACTION. THESE COULD BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR JOBS AND PEOPLE. DOING GIGS. THAT MAY ACTUALLY BE THE REAL APOCALYPSE AN ECONOMY THAT FAILS TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE. SO LAST THING. WHAT SHOULD YOU BE DOING? UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME GETS TOSSED AROUND A LOT. IT SOUNDS NICE BUT WHO PAYS FOR. PORTABLE BENEFITS. INTERESTING IDEA BUT NOT ALLOWS EMPLOYERS TO MISS CLASSIFY THEIR WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND AVOID PAYING INTO EXISTING SOCIAL SAFETY NETS. RETRAINING. WE SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER HEARING ON THE FAILURES OF RETRAINING AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIX THAT. I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S TIME TO GO BIG. IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AMERICAN WORKERS HAD FULL EMPLOYMENT UNEMPLOYMENT WAS AT THREE POINT TWO PERCENT. BY NINETEEN THIRTY THREE WALL STREET HAD PLUNGE THE COUNTRY INTO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT FIFTEEN MILLION WORKERS WERE OUT ON THE STREETS. GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE WAS NOT TO BAIL OUT WALL STREET BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BIG TO FAIL. GOVERNMENT BAILED OUT THE REST OF US. THEY PASSED THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE. IN NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE DAY PASSED THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT. AND THEY SAID. THEY NEEDED TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS TO ENCOURAGE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND TO CURTAIL CERTAIN PRIVATE SECTOR LABOR AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES WHICH CAN HARM. THE GENERAL WELFARE OF WORKERS BUSINESSES IN THE ECONOMY. THAT WOULD SOUND RADICAL IN TODAY'S CONGRESS. IN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT THEY PASSED THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT. OVERTIME EIGHT HOUR DAY NO CHILD LABOR MINIMUM WAGE. IT'S TIME TO GO BIG. THAT'S THE REAL INNOVATION THAT WE NEED FROM YOU AND WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU WAS FAIRLY. THANK YOU MISTER THURMOND. MISTER PAN. AGAIN I I THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAKING FREDDIE ON THIS AND I WOULD CONCUR WITH MY. BROTHER DOT BLOT THAT I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THE OTHER MEMBERS THAT HAVE NOT SHOWN UP OR SHOWN INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK YOU VERY MUCH AND YOUR LEADERSHIP. ON THESE ISSUES AYE. OUTSIDE OF GLOBAL WARMING AND CLIMATE CHANGE I THINK THIS IS THE CRITICAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME ABOUT WHAT IS THE FUTURE WORK LOOK LIKE. IT WORKERS. I'M WORKERS DO NOT WANT A HANDOUT THERE'S DIGNITY AND WORK THERE IS MEANING IN WORK AND WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE TO CREATE THAT DIGNITY MEANING. I THINK THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AS WE THINK ABOUT THESE BIG BIG ISSUES NUMBER ONE IS THE QUESTION AROUND TECHNOLOGIES IMPACT ON OUR WORK. I WANNA TALK WITHOUT A SECOND BUT I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE OF THIS ESPECIALLY WHERE GOVERNMENT PLAYS A BIG ROLE. AND THAT IS THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT DRIVES THAT DRIVES HIS DECISIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR INDUSTRY IN THE YOU SCW WE REPRESENT RETAIL WHERE THE RETAIL CLERKS UNION ME CUTTERS IN FOOD PROCESSING WE REPRESENT A LOT OF WORKERS IN THE RETAIL SPACE. AND A LOT OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN OUR IN OUR SECTOR ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. FORTY THREE LARGE RETAIL SUPERMARKET COMPANIES WHICH OWNED TEN OR MORE STORES HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN UNITED STATES. AND EIGHTEEN OF THOSE COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE EQUITY. YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS TOYS R. US EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT TOYS R. US. TOYS R. US WITH THEIR EIGHT HUNDRED STORES AND THIRTY THOUSAND WORKERS ARE GONNA BE OUT OF A JOB THE STORES IN A CLOSE. AND SURE AMAZON AND OTHER ONLINE RETAILERS HAVE CREATED COMPETITION. BUT REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNDERLYING PIECE OF THIS IS THE FACT THAT THESE ARE COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY PRIVATE EQUITY LIKE BAIN CAPITAL WHO GET LOADED WITH DEBT AND THEN CAN'T PY CAN'T PAY OFF. THE INTEREST ON THE DEBT NOT WE HAVE TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT BANKRUPTCY. WHO ACTUALLY GETS PAID THE WORKERS WITHOUT JOBS IN THE LEFT WITH LITTLE TO NOTHING IN THE SHAREHOLDERS GET MADE WHOLE? WHEN THEY SAW THE ASSETS THIS IS ANOTHER MAJOR PIECE OF JUST WHAT'S DRIVING THIS THIS CONVERSATION IS YOU HAVE COMPANIES LIKE AMAZON WHO ARE ACTUALLY. REINVESTING IN THEIR COMPANY NOT TAKING ASSETS OUT EXTRACTING ACCESO BUT ACTUALLY PUTTING ASSETS BACK INTO CREE LARGER VALUE AND THE CAPITALIZING ON THE LOSS OF BRICK AND MORTAR TAKE TO OPEN UP THAT SPACE IN RETAIL SO I BELIEVE. THAT'S ANOTHER LARGE QUESTION THAT'S NOT THE SUBJECT OF THIS HEARING BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO. IS THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE CREATING IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN THE WORLD. AND I THINK BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE A REAL ROLE TO PLAY IN TERMS OF CREATING DISINCENTIVES. AROUND THIS RESTRUCTURING AND ULTIMATELY UNDERMINES OUR ABILITY TO CREATE WORK. YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF IN TERMS OF THAT QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY IN OUR. IN OUR SECTORS I WILL TELL YOU THAT. YOU KNOW WE JUST REITERATE WHAT WAS SAID HERE THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EMBRACE THIS CHANGE AND ACTUALLY CAPITALIZE ON THE POWER OF THE WORK FORCE. TO MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND INNOVATION WORK FOR WORKERS WORK FOR SOCIETY. YOU KNOW ONLY A STUDY BY MCKINSEY. I CAME OUT WHERE IT SAID SIXTY PERCENT OF JOBS SIX PERCENT OF JOBS CAN HAVE AT LEAST THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR WORK AUTOMATED. SO THINK ABOUT THAT SO IT'S NOT AS MASSIVE AS A HUNDRED PERCENT BUT SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE JOBS CAN HAVE THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR WORK AUTOMATED. AND I THINK A PART OF THIS A REAL BIG PART OF THIS IS. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT OUR ACTUAL UNDERLYING EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE LOOKS LIKE. YOU KNOW AND IN WHILE. I BELIEVE THE WAY THAT WE ULTIMATELY TRAIN WORKERS AND DO THIS IN AND CREATE A TRANSITION IN THIS ECONOMY. IS GONNA BE KEY TO HOW WE ACTUALLY HAVE WORKERS BE ABLE TO. TO CONTINUE TO DO THE JOBS NECESSARY AND ACTUALLY CREATE VALUE FOR COMPANIES AND VALUE FOR CONSUMERS IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE CAN. AND YOU KNOW WE GET AS WE INVEST IN THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN ALSO EMPOWER WORKERS AND THAT THAT WAS EXAMPLES. GIVEN EARLIER ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON IN GERMANY. THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE IS BETWEEN THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT THE GERMAN STEEL WORKERS UNION AND THE GERMAN STEEL INDUSTRY WHERE THEY WILL TO NEGOTIATE CHANGES. AROUND THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS WHERE YOU KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE EIGHT HOUR DAY WILL THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN RESTRUCTURING. A DATA MAY YOU BE LESS THAN AN EIGHT HOUR DAY FOR THE SAME PAY IN GERMANY THEY REDUCE THE WITH THE DAY FROM A WEEK FROM THIRTY SIX HOURS A WEEK TO TWENTY EIGHT HOURS A WEEK. AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE ABLE TO GET A FOUR PERCENT INCREASE IN THEIR SALARY IN PAY. AND ALSO REINVESTED IN AND TRAINING AND FACILITATION OF GOING TO OTHER CAREERS AS TECHNOLOGY IMPACTS THAT WORKFORCE I THINK THOSE ARE SOME IDEAS WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO. TO. THINK ABOUT THAT AS WE MOVE AHEAD IN THIS STRUCTURE. AND I WILL SAY THE FINAL THING IS YOU KNOW AMAZON GO BLUE APRON SELF CHECKOUT APPLE PAY AND MANY OTHER ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY WILL CHANGE THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE. BUT WILL NOT WHAT WILL NOT CHANGE IS THAT EMPLOYERS THAT CAN CREATE AN EXPERIENCE THAT ATTRACTS PEOPLE TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR. BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATIONS THE OPPORTUNITY RETRAIN WORKERS TO GAIN SOFT SKILLS IN CUSTOMER SERVICE AS WELL AS HARD SKILLS. LIKE EXPANDING CULINARY TRAINING TO THE RETAIL SITES WILL BE OF VALUE ADDED. THE CURRENT BANKRUPTCY OF TOYS R. US IS JUST THE LATEST EXAMPLE. WELL ONLINE RETAILERS IS AMAZON GO GROUPON AND OTHERS HAVE PROVIDED COMPETITION BRICK AND MORTAR. AGAIN I BELIEVE PRIVATE EQUITIES ADVANCEMENTS THAT RESELL SECTOR HAS REALLY EXACERBATED THE PROBLEM. GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB AT REGULATING WALL STREET CREATING MORE EQUITABLE TAX STRUCTURE INCENTIVIZING PARTNERSHIPS WITH LABOR TO DEVELOP A TRAINING. FOR THE GREAT TRANSITION THAT IS HAPPENING OUR ECONOMY TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR PROFESSIONS AND BY EXTENSION FOR CONSUMERS TO CONSUME THE GOODS. THAT WORKERS AND COMPANIES ARE PRODUCING I'M GLAD THAT WE LIVE IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WE HAVE CHAIRS SUCH AS SENATOR AND IN ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMOND TO REALLY HELP LEAD IN THIS CONVERSATION. AND YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT UFCW IN THE THE WRESTLE LABOR COMMUNITY AS YOU CAN SEE HERE COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENT AND ALSO WORK WITH OUR EMPLOYERS. TO MAKE THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PAY FOR WORKERS AND SOCIETY THAT WE LIVE IN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER IRVING AND I'M SORE. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY THANK YOU T. OR ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WORKERS STATEWIDE AND I REALLY. WANT TO TRY TO GIVE A PERSPECTIVE ON THE THE PUBLIC SECTOR IMPACT OF AUTOMATION I THINK WE OFTEN THINK ABOUT AUTOMATION I THINK ABOUT THE PRIVATE SECTOR I THINK MY BROTHERS HAVE GIVEN. A GOOD OVERVIEW OF OF THE FEAR AND THAT THE COMPLEXITIES ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE BUT ON THE PUBLIC SECTOR SIDE. THIS FEAR OF AUTOMATION AND HAS REALLY TAKEN US BY STORM WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN IT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS SO I HOPE TO GIVE YOU GUYS SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW IT HAS WORK TO OUR BENEFIT. BUT THEN SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE LEERY ABOUT ESPECIALLY AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SAFETY NET BENEFITS THAT I KNOW YOU TWO IN PARTICULAR CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. AND HOW AUTOMATION EFFECTS THAT AFFECTS THE SERVICE DELIVERY. I'M I THINK IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. OUR APPREHENSION ON INNOVATION IT'S BECAUSE THAT A LOT OF IT IS BASED ON COST SAVINGS AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT COST SAVINGS A VENDOR WANTING TO COME TO A PUBLIC AGENCY AND TALK ABOUT COST SAVINGS IN THE SENSE OF OUR SAFETY NET BENEFITS. THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A FEAR THAT GOES WITH IT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INNOVATION THAT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT I THINK THAT OUR WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES WANT TO BE PART OF AN INNOVATION STRATEGY AND A STRATEGY TO TRY TO MAKE BENEFITS AND SERVICE DELIVERY. MORE ACHIEVABLE AND MORE CONVENIENT FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE BUT NOT FOR THE PURPOSES SOLELY OF COST SAVINGS WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN THE PARAMOUNT OF A LOT OF THE VENDORS THAT HAVE SHOPPED AROUND THE CAPITAL. FOR YEAR OVER YEAR SPECIFICALLY FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE EXPANDED MEDI CAL SOME YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT WHEN THAT ANSETT HAPPENED THEY WOULD BE PRIVATIZING IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN APPLY THROUGH. THERE ITEM THERE'S THEIR PHONES IN THEIR COMPUTERS AT HOME AND THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF THE SAFETY NET BENEFITS THAT WE PROVIDE UNFORTUNATELY IT ROLLED OUT PRETTY FAST AND YOU GUYS WERE VERY PARAMOUNT IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WHERE. THIS IDEA OF AUTOMATION WAS KIND OF THE PARAMOUNT IDEA OF HOW THESE FOLKS WE GET SERVICE DELIVERY IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER IT DIDN'T WORK FOR SOME TIME THAT WORKERS BECAME FRIGHTENED CENTER IN THAT CONVERSATION. THAT WORKERS WERE AT THE FRONT LINES OF HOW INNOVATION WORKS AND HOW THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A COST SAVINGS OUR GOAL IN MENTALITY THAT WE THINK DROVE A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION BEFORE. THE DIFFERENCE AND THAT IS WHEN THE WORKERS GOT INVOLVED WE ACTUALLY GAVE INPUT ON WHAT ALGORITHMS ACTUALLY WORK TO GET PEOPLE TRANSITION VARIOUS IT SEE IF THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WILL LOCK UP. IF THE SYSTEMS WHEN ACTUALLY WORK BECAUSE AT THE END WHEN SOMETHING IN THE AUTOMATION DOESN'T WORK ESPECIALLY FOR SAFETY NET BENEFITS THEY COME TO THE IN PERSON WORKER AT SOME POINT TIME. AND THEY'RE VERY FRUSTRATED AND THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH A LONG PROCESS OF BEING ON A PHONE CALL PRESSING ONE PRESSING TO PRESSING THREE GOING BACK TO ONE AND THEY CAN'T GET WHAT THEY NEED. AS A BY THE TIME THEY'RE IN THE FACE OF OUR SOCIAL WORKERS ARE ELIGIBILITY WORKERS ARE STATE WORKERS AT EDIE DEAR DIEM V. THEY ARE EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED. RIGHT OUR JOB AS SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS IN PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS ARTIST SERVICE THE CLIENT IT'S COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO A PUBLIC. MISSION OF PROFIT SAVINGS ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO SAVE MONEY IT'S IT COMPLETELY GOES CONTRADICTORY TO THAT AND I THINK OUR GOAL AS FRONTLINE WORKERS ON YOUR BEHALF IS TO HELP THE CLIENTS. DELIVER SERVICES AND PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN THEIR MOST VULNERABLE STATE OF MIND IF YOU THINK ABOUT OUR SAFETY NET PROGRAMS IT'S A SAFETY NET IT'S THE NET THAT'S GONNA CATCH PEOPLE AND THE MOST VULNERABLE TIMES. IN THE RULES VULNERABLE TIMES OF NEED WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T FOLLOW THOSE CRACKS. HAVING A SYSTEM THAT IS PUT IN PLACE ONLY TO SAVE MONEY IS. BY FAR GONNA HAVE MORE CRACKS IN IT THAN A HUMAN BEING CAN HAVE OFTENTIMES ARE GONNA COME AND SAY WE WANT TO INNOVATE WE WANT TO STREAMLINE AND OUR MINDS THOSE ARE WAYS. TO TAKE AWAY JOBS OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES EVERY SINGLE DAY TO DO THIS WORK. I AM I THINK THAT IF WE I TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AUTOMATION HAPPENS WITHOUT THE WORKERS INPUT. WE LOSE WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES THOSE ARE GOOD PAYING JOBS THAT WORKERS LOSE OFTENTIMES ALL SAME WORKERS ARE IN THE SAME LINES OF THE SAME PEOPLE THEY ARE PROTECTING. BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE OUT OF A JOB AND THEY NEED SERVICES FROM OUR SAFETY NET BENEFITS TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL. WORKERS HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EXPECTED TO DO HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ROLLED OUT A MEDI CAL HAPPENED WITHOUT WORKERS BEING TRAINED AND SO WORKERS THAT KNOW. HOW TO ANSWER A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS ONCE THEY ROLLED OUT? IF WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT WOULD INNOVATION OR A COST SAVINGS MEASURES ARE PUT IN PLACE FOR AUTOMATION THAT ACTUALLY GOES CONTRARY TO THE ULTIMATE GOAL. AND A LOT OF THE SYSTEMS WERE AUTOMATION WAS PUT FORWARD IN THE STATE CHILD SUPPORT THE COURT SYSTEMS THE M. V. ET DE LA CALLE HERE'S PROJECT I CAN GO ON FOR EVER. THEY ENDED UP COSTING THE STATE MORE MONEY THAN THEY WOULD HAVE COST IF WE WOULD JUST INVESTED IN FRONTLINE WORKERS BECAUSE PROCUREMENT HAS TO HAPPEN. THE SYSTEMS DON'T WORK CLIENTS COME TO THE TABLE AND SAY I'M NOT GETTING MY BENEFITS ON TIME AND YOU HAVE A FEDERAL LAWSUIT FACING YOU BECAUSE WE HAVE A CERTAIN TIME LIMIT. TO DELIVER A TO PEOPLE THAT WE CARE ABOUT. UNFORTUNATELY ISN'T THAT NEW AUTOMATION IN THE WORLD OF PUBLIC SERVICES ISN'T NECESSARILY A NEW THING THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE ENGAGED IN WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND THE TIME THAT IT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL HAS BEEN WHEN THE WORKERS ARE ON THE FRONTLINE. WHEN THE WORKERS ARE ACTUALLY TELLING THEIR EXPERIENCE THAT I HEARD MY BROTHER'S TALK ABOUT TWO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CAN TELL THEIR EXPERIENCE OF WHAT'S EFFECTIVE AND WHAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE ABSENT THAT. THE GOAL IS NOT INNOVATION THE GOAL AGAIN GOES BACK TO THE PROFIT SAVINGS AND THE COST SAVINGS THAT AGAIN IS COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO THE DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES. FOR OUR SAFETY NET IN MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. I THINK IF YOU ASK WHAT THE STATE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTROLLED AUTOMATION AND THE IDEA OF INNOVATION ON OUR PUBLIC SECTOR SERVICES IN OUR SAFETY NET BENEFITS IS AGAIN. I HATE TO BE REDUNDANT WORKERS HAVE TO LEAD WE HAVE TO BE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE DISCUSSION WE KNOW FIRST HAND HOW TO MAKE. APPLYING FOR SERVICES MORE CONVENIENT FOR WORK FOR CLIENTS BECAUSE WERE THERE AND WE SEE IT A CAN BE BASED ON AN ALGORITHM ARE A SYSTEM THAT IS INTENDED ONLY TO SAVE COSTS THAT'S NOT INNOVATION THAT AGAIN. IT'S ALL AS ALL I PIVOTED AT A COST SAVINGS AND OF COST SAVINGS IS THE MOTIVATION THAT WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT THERE'S GONNA BE IMPACTS TO PUBLIC SERVICES. CLIENTS ARE GONNA FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS BECAUSE THE GOAL IN COST SAVINGS. THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN ACHIEVE IT IS BY GIVING CLIENTS LESS BENEFITS. THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WORKERS THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES. AND I THINK IN BOTH OF THOSE INSTANCES YOU GUYS WERE HERE HOW CONTRADICTORY IDEAS TO THE GOAL OF PUBLIC SERVICE WE WANT TO CATCH EVERYBODY BEFORE THEY FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE WANT TO TRY TO PROVIDE SELF SUFFICIENCY IN EVERY WAY THAT WE CAN THERE IS NO ALGORITHM THAT CAN TELL US A PERSON THAT CAME IN FOR CAL FRESH ACTUALLY NEED HOUSING. THERE'S NO ALGORITHM THAT CAN TELL US SOMEBODY THAT CAME IN FOR HOUSING ACTUALLY MIGHT NEED A MEDI CAL CARD. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HUMAN BEINGS SEE THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SEE THROUGH OUR DIALOGUE THAT OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM THERE IS A REALITY THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO MEET THE HAPPY PATH THAT YOU PROBABLY HEAR ABOUT A LOT IN YOUR. SUB COMMITTEES AND YOU HEAR ABOUT A LOT AS WELL THERE'S SOME INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA THEY CAN GO THROUGH AN ELIGIBILITY PROCESS OR PROCESS. TO THEIR PHONE ARE DOING ON MY SYSTEM THAT IS HAPPY THERE'S NO HICCUPS IS VERY RARE AND IT'S NOT COMMON AND SO IN THOSE INSTANCES THEY HAVE TO REACH OUT TO WORKER THEY HAVE TO CONTACT A WORKER. IN OF THE WORKER ISN'T FAMILIAR AND LEADING THE ALGORITHM IN THE SYSTEMS THAT THE CLIENT JUST WENT THROUGH WE HAVE TO TELL A WORKER I CAN'T HELP YOU. OUR CLIENT I'M SORRY THAT WE CAN HELP YOU AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS IS IS EASY FOR A CLIENT TO ACCEPT WHEN THEY'RE IN THEIR MOST VULNERABLE STATE AND THEY'RE SEEKING HELP AND THE MOST VULNERABLE STATE OF MIND. SO I WOULD SAY THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO AS AS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AT US ON THE LABOR SIDE IS WORK TOGETHER WHEN AUTOMATION COMES ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. AND SECONDLY BE ABLE TO CALL A DUCK A DUCK IF THERE IS A GOOD HAVE THERE'S A GOAL OF COST SAVINGS WHAT'S THE IMPACT AND AT WHAT COST. NOT ONLY FROM THE WORKERS PERSPECTIVE AND PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS LOSING THEIR JOB BUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE CLIENT THAT WANTED TO COME IN AND RECEIVE HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION OF SERVICES THAT YOU GUYS ARE VERY AWARE OF AS WELL. AND ONLY RECEIVE ONE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY WENT THEY WENT ONLINE SYSTEM I THINK SEIU IS FULLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO INNOVATE AND TRYING TO MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR CLIENTS BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. AND CERTAINLY NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF GOOD PUBLIC SECTOR JOBS. OF THANK YOU SO MUCH AND. NOTE STATE THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A MIXED RECORD ACTUALLY WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SUCCESSFUL IT PROJECTS ATTENDED YOUR LOSS ABOUT THOSE IN THE NEWS AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL THAT HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN. I'VE ALWAYS MARK THAT THE. ONES IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS OFTEN ARE THE ONES WHERE THE VENDOR COMES IN AND SAYS I HAVE A SOLUTION AND DOESN'T TALK TO THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK. AND THEY HAVE IN THEIR MINDS SOME. SOMETHING THEY IMAGINED ABOUT HOW IT'S SUPPOSED TO WORK IN THE NEXT TALK PEOPLE DOING THE WORK AND THEN THEY WONDER WHY SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK VERY WELL. AND THAT WHY EVERYONE'S FRUSTRATED WITH IT SO. SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT THAT'S. WHEN WE LOOK AT. HOW WE AUTOMATE IT ELEVATES? WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT ASPECT. BUT IT IT YOU THINK THE OTHER PIECE THOUGH IS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS. IT IS IT WAS BROUGHT UP IS THAT. THE IDEA THAT. THAT ACTUALLY. INNOVATION AUTOMATION CARE AND ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE. THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE WORKER THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE THERE. I THINK THERE IS A PART ABOUT THAT IMPROVE PROGRAM FACT WE'VE SEEN OVER TIME THAT. WE'VE HAD INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY BY WORKERS. SOME DO THAT AUTOMATION SOME DUE TO OTHER FACTORS OVER THE PAST COUPLE DECADES. BUT THE ACTUAL REWARDS OF THAT INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY HAS NOT BEEN SHARED WITH THE WORKER IT'S GOT OFF TO WALLSTREET OR WHEREVER ELSE. AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO AS WERE WORKING ON. IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY TO BE ENSURING THAT. THE WORKERS ACTUALLY GET A FAIR SHARE OF THE PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAT DATA RESULTING AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS IS WERE MOVING AHEAD WITH. WITH THE. INNOVATION AUTOMATION LIKE EVERYONE ELSE CALL IT'S. SO PERHAPS WE CAN. TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT YOU SEE IS AS YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE SECTOR PUBLIC SECTOR PEOPLE SAY. AND SAY THAT OKAY WE WANT TO END OF AB ONE AUTOMATE BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO. YOU KNOW WE THINK THAT THAT'S ALLOW YEAR. MEMBERS OF THE WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO DO A LITTLE MORE THAN THEY WERE ABLE TO DO BEFORE MAYBE DO MORE EASILY ETCETERA. HOW THE CONVERSATIONS GO ABOUT OKAY GREAT NOW YOU GET TO WE WERE DOING A LITTLE LAWYER AND? PROBABLY HOPEFULLY YOU MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY AND WHAT PART OF IT'S COMING BACK TO THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK. BEGIN WITH. SO I I THINK IN PUBLIC SERVICES THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES WHERE AUTOMATION HAS WORKED AND HELPED OUR PRODUCTIVITY. THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN CAL WORKS WE USED TO REQUIRE PAGE AT STEPS TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE OFFICE WEEZER REQUIRE THEIR WHOLE BANKING STATEMENT TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE OFFICE. THAT CAN BE ELECTRONICALLY SCANNED AND SENT TO A WORKER RIGHT SO IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE WORKER TO LEAVE HER DESK AND GO TO THE LOBBY COLLECT INFORMATION PUT IT IN A HARD FILE. THOSE THINGS DO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS IN THERE'S A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES LIKE THAT WERE DONE WITH THE WORKER INPUT SO IT GOES BACK TO I THINK WHERE WE STARTED THE CONVERSATION IF THE WORKER IS SITTING DOWN. AND THERE'S A QUESTION HOW DO WE INNOVATE HOW DO WE IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY TO HELP YOU DO YOUR JOB BETTER RIGHT THRE'S A NUMBER OF IDEAS THAT OUR MEMBERS CAN COME UP WITH THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A LOT OF THEM WITH OUR PARTNERSHIPS WITH YOU IN THE COUNTIES AND SUCH. I THINK THAT THE PROBLEMS COME AS WHICH WHICH YOU SAID WHEN THEY HAPPEN BEFORE THERE'S ENGAGEMENT WITH THE WORKER WITH AN ANTICIPATION THAT I THINK THIS MIGHT HELP. AND REALLY IT ACTUALLY PILES ONTO THE NUMBER AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO SO HOW I THINK WERE INNOVATIVE WERE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO SOLVE IT BUT IF A VENDOR IS LEADING THE CONVERSATION AND THE WORKERS ARE ONLY IN THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE STARTING OUT. FROM THE WRONG BLOCK IN YOU KNOW IN WHAT I IS SO AND THE FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT THIS TWO PIECES OF THIS. NUMBER ONE IS WE CANNOT ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO REROUTE TO REWRITE THE RULES AROUND WHO WHO WHO THEY WORK FOR. RIGHT WE HAVE TO CREATE A EQUAL LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE INDUSTRIES TO HAVE REAL FAIR COMPETITION RIGHT BECAUSE OF SOME WORK SO IN OUR WORLD. IF SOME OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WE REPRESENT ACTUALLY HAVE EMPLOYEES AND THEY'RE IN THERE AND THEY'RE BOUND BY A SERIES OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE LOGGED A ONE THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. AND YOU HAVE OTHER EMPLOYERS THAT DON'T HAVE EMPLOYEES AND SUBCONTRACT OUT THERE WORKING ON IT. UNACCOUNTABLE TO THE SAME LEVELS OF NEW LAW THAT THE THAT THE EMPLOYERS WE REPRESENT OUR THAN THAT RIGHT THERE WAS UNFAIR MARKETPLACE UNFAIR COMPETITION. SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT CREATING A FAIR PLAYING FIELD AROUND COMPETITION FOR REALLY GONNA HAVE A TRUE FREE MARKET RIGHT. I WOULD SAY SECONDLY. YEAH I I LOOK BACK TO THAT IT WAS TWO THOUSAND TEN A TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WHEN OUR BARACK OBAMA GOTTEN REALLY CRITICIZED HE SAID YOU DIDN'T BUILD THAT. RIGHT YOU KNOW HE CAME THAT VISALIA RALLY IN IT WAS THE SAME THAT YOU CAN BILL THAT WHAT HE WAS. NO WE ALL BELOW KNOWN BELIEVES. HIS ACTIONS ARE ABOUT HOW. NO COMPANY EXISTS AN ISLAND NO INNOVATION HAPPENS WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE USE THAT LEVERAGE IN THIS TRANSITION TO SAY YOU'RE GONNA BE A COMBO OF WE INVEST DOLLARS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. WHEN WE INVEST DOLLARS IN SORT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT YOU COMPANY ARE BENEFITING FROM THAT YOU HAVE WE HAVE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT BACK FROM YOU. THAT YOU DON'T OF REINVEST THAT YOUR WORK FORCE RIGHT AND I THINK THERE'S WAYS TO DO THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WE HAVE WORKFORCE INVESTMENT BOARD DOLLARS WE HAVE YOU KNOW A SERIES OF DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TRINITY COLLEGE WITH A SERIES OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS. AS EMPLOYES ARE GOING ON HIRING PEOPLE THEY'RE GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THIS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM I THINK IS A TIME TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE RESTRUCTURE. YOU KNOW THESE CONCEPTS AROUND JOB RETRAINING IN JUST YOU KNOW JOB BECAUSE HE'S IN A WAY THAT CREATES A LEVERAGE POINT. FOR WORKERS IN A LEVERAGE POINT FOR YOU KNOW THE STATE AND I THINK THOSE THINGS TO DO AND GET AND AND REALLY BUILD A TRUE PARTNERSHIP. TO BE IN BUSINESS AND LABOR AND GOVERNMENT. I'M A TEAMSTER SO I WON'T PULL ANY PUNCHES. EVERY EMPLOYER THAT WE'VE DEALT WITH THAT'S DOING THIS TECHNOLOGY. TOM PAUL OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH SILICON VALLEY. IS THAT EVERYBODY'S VERY NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN TERMS OF REGULATION. WE STILL LIVE IN A DAY AND AGE WHERE LABOR HAS CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL POWER IN THIS BUILDING. AND AT THE LEVEL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO MAKE THAT A REALITY. SO WE HAVE SOME EMPLOYERS WHO I WOULD. SAY ARE ENLIGHTENED ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE. THAT. THERE BENEFITS IN A PARTNERSHIP. WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY SHAPE REGULATIONS THAT HELP THEM DO THE INNOVATION THAT THEY WANTED TO? AND HELP US MAKE SURE THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE BENEFICIARIES OF THAT INNOVATION AS WELL. WE CAN EAT DINNER FOR NOT INVITED TO THE PARTY. SO EVERYTIME YOU HOLD ONE OF THESE HEARINGS AND PEOPLE LIKE US GET INVITED TO COME UP AND TESTIFY. I WALK OUT HERE WITH FIVE BUSINESS CARDS FROM SOME COMPANY THAT'S DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY THAT WANTS TO TALK TO US. THIS IS WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP AND AND. I WANT TO REDO A HEADLINE FROM THE CALIFORNIA FELL CHAU. LABOR FEDERATION THE STATE FEDS NEWSLETTER. TALKING ABOUT AN AUTOMATION CONFERENCE CALL BY GOVERNOR BROWN. GOVERNOR BROWN ANNOUNCED THIS THURSDAY HE IS CALLED THE STATEWIDE CONFERENCE OF BUSINESS AND LABOR LEADERS TO DISCUSS THE IMPACT OF AUTOMATION ON CALIFORNIA'S WORKERS AND THE ECONOMY. CONFERENCE WILL BE HELD ON LA ON NOVEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH AND TWENTY EIGHTH WITH ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED REPRESENTATIVES OF LABOR INDUSTRY EDUCATION IN STATE GOVERNMENT. SO WHEN I FIRST HEARD ABOUT THIS I WAS SAYING HEY HOW COME WE DIDN'T GET AN INVITATION TO THIS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA ON THIS IT'S SEPTEMBER EIGHTH NINETEEN SIXTY ONE. IT WAS ARE CURRENT GOVERNOR'S. FATHER I WANT TO THANK SARAH FLOCKS FROM THE STATE FED FOR THIS. WE NEED THE SAME SORT OF GOVERNMENT CONVENING WE NEED A COMMISSION TO LOOK AT THESE ISSUES ON AUTOMATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE FUTURE OF WORK. WE NEED YOU TO SET THE TABLE AND GET THE INVITATIONS OUT AND MAKE LABOR AND INDUSTRY SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND WORK OUT THE DEALS THAT BENEFIT ALL OF US. IF YOU ON THAT POINT AS YOU KNOW THERE IS AT LEAST ONE BILL PROPOSE THAT WOULD CREATE SUCH A COMMISSION. AND I WOULD SAY. TO THE CONCERNS THAT YOU ALL EXPRESS ABOUT MEMBERS NOT BEING HERE. THAT WE'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO GIVE PARTY TESTIMONY AGAIN. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT COMMISSION. PUMP THEIR SEVERAL OF THE BILLS I THINK RELATE. AND YOU KNOW FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT WE DO THIS ON THE LABOR COMMITTEE WE LIKE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY. GIVE THE KEY POINTS AGAIN AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE IT'S A. INFORMATIONAL HEARING OR JUST BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BUSIER DAYS BUT ON WE DON'T WANT THE POINTS TO BE MISSED IN IF YOU'RE WILLING. I LIKE TO ASK OUR STAFF TO WORK WITH YOU ON HOW WE WE'VE BEEN TO THAT AGENDA WILL WERE ACTUALLY VOTING ON THOSE BILLS. AN OPPORTUNITY IF YOU TO MAKE THOSE PRESENTATIONS OF THAT THERE HEARD. AND. I THINK YOU YOU GOT IT ACROSS PRETTY CLEARLY EACH OF YOU IN YOUR TESTIMONY THAT. ARE. NO MATTER WHAT INNOVATION AND NO MATTER WHAT COST SAVING GETS CREATED THERE CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT HAVING. THE WORK FORCE THAT CANNOT BE. CANNOT REPLACE AND THAT NO COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION IS WHAT IT IS WITHOUT ITS WORK FORCE AND I THINK YOU'VE. YOU'VE CERTAINLY DONE YOUR MEMBERS. EXTREME JUSTICE IN GETTING THAT ACROSS. YEAH I WON ACTUAL COUPLE QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE PROVOCATIVE THOUGH BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT WE ARE IN THIS WE ARE WHERE WE ARE MOMENT. AND YOU KNOW THESE COMPANIES ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH CERTAIN THINGS AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY DO. HAVE AT THE HEART OF THEM PROFIT MAKING EXPENSE SAVING AND. DIRECTLY THE LOSS OF JOBS UNLESS THERE IS SOME ABOUT THAT AND. YOU KNOW ONE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PRESENCE OF OUR COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AND I 䀡ITE WHENEVER SHE'S READY IF SHE WANTS TO MAKE SOME REMARKS BUT ARE WE ARE WE AT SOME. AYE INEVITABLE PLACE INEVITABLE CONFLICT WHERE COMPANIES WANT TO MAKE PROFIT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. AS THEY WANT TO SAVE MONEY THAT'S WHAT THEY DO AND THAT WE ARE AT AN UNAVOIDABLE CONFLICT THAT IS CURRENTLY PITTING. THAT INTERESTS WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF JOBS BEING LOST AS A RESULT ARE WE THERE. I'M. I THINK THAT THEY CAN COEXIST. I THINK THAT THERE IS A REALITY THAT IN AND I THINK WE'VE SEEN THIS IN PUBLIC SERVICES WHERE YOU COULD FIND EFFICIENCIES AND PROTECT JOBS AT THE SAME TIME. I THINK WHEN THE GOAL STARTS OFF WITH ONE ONLY ONE IN MIND WHICH IS COST SAVINGS THAT ONE IS GONNA FALL WITH IT AND THE SAME TO THE CONTRARY IF IF THE GOAL IN MIND IS ONLY TO SAVE WORKERS AND YOU'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT INNOVATION. THEN YOU DON'T ACHIEVE BOTH GOALS I'VE SEEN IN THE MEDI CAL OPERATION WE'VE WE'VE ALLOWED ONLINE APPLICATIONS BUT WE CREATED A NO WRONG DOOR POLICY THAT'S WHAT WE WE NAMED IT IN THAT'S WHAT WE WANT. YOU CAN GO THROUGH ANY DOOR YOU WANT TO TO RECEIVE ELIGIBILITY FOR PROGRAMS YOU CAN GO TALK TO SOMEONE IN PERSON YOU CAN APPLY ON YOUR SMARTPHONE YOU CAN APPLY FOR PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY AT A HOSPITAL. YOU CAN GO TO A NAVIGATOR AND APPLY FOR ELIGIBILITY BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A NEED FOR WORKER. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MEDI CAL WHAT WE DID IS NO ONE CAN DETERMINE YOUR HERE IT FIXED ELIGIBILITY AND LESS IT'S A HUMAN BEING ELIGIBILITY WORKER. THE SYSTEM CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY THINK THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE BUT A WORKER A HUMAN BEING IS WHO YOU GUYS HAVE ENTRUSTED TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE IF THEY RECEIVE STATE AND FEDERAL BENEFITS. AND SO I THINK THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU CAN DO BOTH AND IF IF IF THE GOAL IN MIND A GUINNESS TO INNOVATE. AND. HONOR THE WORKERS THAT YOU HAVE AND AND AND REALIZE THAT THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO ANY INFRASTRUCTURE THEN THERE IS A WAY THAT THAT CAN THAT CAN CO EXIST. THE REALITY IS THERE MIGHT BE SOME CHANGES IN AND JOB ASSIGNMENTS THERE MIGHT BE WORKERS THAT YOU TRANSITION TO SOMETHING THAT ENHANCES THEIR EXPERIENCE THROUGH AN ONLINE APPLICATION. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY HAVE THE SAME JOB OR MAYBE EVEN THE SAME CLASSIFICATION BUT I THINK THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT WE CAN UTILIZE A WORKFORCE THAT WE HAVE ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WHAT TRYING TO BE INNOVATIVE AND GIVE CLIENTS THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR SERVICES IN A MORE CONVENIENT WAY AS A BLACK ON THE SAME QUESTION AND COULD I ASK YOU TO THINK BACK TO YOUR EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE ABOUT? THE. THE DELIVERY ROBOTS AND I THOUGHT WHEN YOU SAID THAT IT THAT MAKES THE JOB SAFER FOR EMPLOYEES AT THE AYE THAT'S A GREAT THING I THOUGHT OKAY WE CAN USE A AYE TO CREATE SAFETY AND THAT'S A REALLY GOOD GOAL. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA OF. HILL SAW DRIVING CARS. AND AND THEY SAID THAT SOFT DRIVING CARS WILL MAKE THE ROAD SAFER FOR ALL OF US AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE JUST LOOK AT MY DRIVING RECORD WHEN THEY CAME UP WITH THIS BUT. IT SEEMS NOBLE TO SAY THAT YES YOU CAN CREATE A SCENARIO WHERE THERE FEWER ACCIDENTS. BUT ISN'T THERE AS A RESULT OF THAT. THE CONSEQUENCE THAT THERE WILL BE FEWER PEOPLE TO DRIVE VEHICLES AND THAT WILL BE JOB LOSS. YEAH WELL SO LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS FOR MEDICS THEM BE BACK HERE ON THURSDAY TO MEET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. WHO ARE DEVELOPING REGULATIONS FOR SELF DRIVING TRUCKS THEY JUST RELEASED? THERE REGULATIONS FOR SELF DRIVING CARS. IT SHOULD BE ON THE ROADS OF CALIFORNIA NEXT MONTH AND I'M SURE MANY OF YOU HEARD THAT YESTERDAY A SELF DRIVING CAR UBER CAR KILLED SOMEBODY. IN ARIZONA. I AM CONVINCED NOW FROM TALKING TO SOME OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGY AROUND THESE TRUCKS THAT. WE'RE ON THE CUSP. WE COULD GO THAT DIRECTION. WHERE? THE NEW TRUCKS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. COULD. REALIZE SIGNIFICANT FUEL SAVINGS FOR THE COMPANIES SO THEY WOULD SAVE MONEY. WHERE IT COULD MAKE OUR MEMBERS JOB SAFER BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THINGS LIKE DRIVERS CYSTIC TECHNOLOGY THAT PROTECT THEM THAT STOPPED THE TRUCK IN THE EVENT OF ACCIDENTS AND I'VE ACTUALLY? STOOD IN FRONT OF DRIVERLESS BUSES AS A TEST WITH ONE OF OUR EMPLOYERS TRANSDEV. I'M STILL HERE SO. AT ME WITH HER CROWD HELP ME I'M STILL HERE. YOU KNOW. YOU HAVE MY WIFE DIDN'T KNOW THE. THE THE TECHNOLOGY IS ACTUALLY THERE THE COULD HELP. THESE TRUCKS ARE REALLY EXPENSIVE PIECES OF MACHINERY. THEY REQUIRE SKILLS THAT ARE MEMBERS WHO DRIVE FOR UPS AND OTHER COMPANIES DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE. TALKING TO SOME THE MANUFACTURER'S I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IF OUR MEMBERS IF WE WORKED WITH THEM TO TRAIN OUR MEMBERS UP TO HAVE THE SKILLS TO DRIVE THIS EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT. THAT THEY IN TURN WOULD HAVE MORE EARNING POWER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE SAY FOR JOBS AND THE COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING GOODS WOULD REALIZE COST SAVINGS IN THE PROCESS. THAT'S A WIN WIN FORMULA. BUT IF THE D. M. V.. ROLLS OUT REGULATIONS. BUT JUST LETS THESE COMPANIES DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH LITTLETON CHEN OR CONSEQUENCES. THEN THAT'S THE LOSE LOSE SCENARIO FOR EVERYBODY EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS AND SAVE COSTS AT THE EXPENSE OF WORKERS LIKE MY SISTER HERE WAS TALKING ABOUT. SO I IF I WOULD SAY. I'M A I'M A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE QUOTE THAT THE ARCHITECT HISTORY BENDS TOWARDS JUSTICE. BUT IT'S OUR ROLE TO BEND THAT ARC OF HISTORY TOWARDS JUSTICE AND AND I DO THINK WE HAVE REAL CHOICES IN THIS MATTER AND NOTHING IS INEVITABLE. NO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT TECHNOLOGICAL YOU KNOW TECHNOLOGICAL REVOLUTION YOU KNOW THAT IT'S HAPPENING IS INEVITABLE IS ONE THAT I THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN. AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL WAY TO THINK ABOUT HOW EACH OF US UNDERSTAND OUR ROLES IN THAT EQUATION BUSINESS HAS A ROLE. GOVERNMENT HAS A ROLE LABOR HAS A ROLE. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT TRUE PARTNERSHIP LOOKS LIKE IT I THINK YOU KNOW. DOUG JUST GIVE YOU A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE YOU KNOW SUITED TO GIVE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE. IN OUR WORLD. YOU NO IN ESPECIALLY THE RETAIL GROCERY SETTING YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS BIG THING ABOUT AMAZON GO RIGHT YOU DON'T HAVE THESE YOU KNOW THAT HAVE THE STORES ARE NO EMPLOYEES AND IT. IT HE WAS GONNA WALK AND TAKE THEIR STUFF IN THE BAG AND THEN LEAVE AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND YOU KNOW THAT'S CAN BE GREAT. YOU KNOW. THAT WILL BE A PART OF SOME OF THIS DISCUSSION AND IT'S GONNA BE A PART OF THE YOU KNOW THE ECONOMIC EQUATION BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO EMPLOYERS. AND WHAT EMPLOYERS TELL US THE ONES THAT REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH US TO SAID LOOK. WE ACCEPT THAT THE ROLE OF THE WORKER IS GONNA CHANGE AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU TO CHANGE THAT ROLE TOGETHER. RIGHT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN PEOPLE COME INTO THE STORE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW EVERYONE HERE GO SHOPPING ON SUNDAY MORNING I MEAN OR WHATEVER DAY I GO SHOPPING Y. FAMILY THAT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU SHARE WITH YOUR FAMILY. YOU GET TO KNOW YOUR READ SO CLERK YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHATEVER PIECE OF FRUIT OR YOU KNOW PIECE OF MEAT THAT YOU HONOR SOME WINE THAT YOU WANT TO TASTE. PEOPLE LIKE THAT ACTUALLY TEND TO BUY MORE THINGS RIGHT SO IT'S ABOUT HOW WE RE READ RETRAIN. THE WORKERS IN THOSE STORES TO TO HELP ADAPT TO THAT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE IMPROVING AND IT'S A CHOICE. ITS A CHOICE THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO MAKE AND THAT IS ALSO A CHOICE THAT I THINK WE AS A SOCIETY HAVE TO MAKE. IN IN LABOR WHERE YOU KNOW WITH WHAT WE HAVE LEFT AGAIN OUR FIRM ARE PLACE IN THIS DISCUSSION. RIGHT AND I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENT UNIONS TACKLE THESE ISSUES BUT I THINK IT'S A REAL CHOICE AND I DO THINK WE CAN BEND THAT ARC OF HISTORY TOWARDS JUSTICE. AT READING THROUGH THESE THINGS I THINK IT'S LEGISLATORS AND CONCERN POLICY MAKERS I THINK THERE'S A LOT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN SHOW AS EXAMPLES FOR US THE COUNTRY. THE ART DOESN'T BEND BY ITSELF TREND DOWN THE STREET WILL STATE AND SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THEM IN THE ARE TOWARD SOCIAL JUSTICE. ACTUALLY NEVER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AND AM I WANNA APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE AT TWO OTHER COMMITTEES I WAS SITTING IN THIS MORNING SO. I I DIDN'T GET TO SEE ALL OF THE GREAT TESTIMONIUM SHORE. BUT WHAT I THINK I THINK THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION AS ONE WHO HAS. CONSISTENTLY FOUGHT AGAINST THIS NOTION THAT. WERE IN A PREDETERMINED COURSE OF OF ACTION IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS LITTLE ICE WATCH THE JETSONS AND WOOD BUT WAS TOLD THAT BY THE TIME I GREW UP THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE LIVING AND. STILL WAITING ON MY. LITTLE TRANSFORMER. SPACESHIP BOMB. SO I THINK A LOT OF A LOT OF THE. TALKS TOWARDS. AUTOMATION WILD SOME THE TALK IS HYPERBOLE AND AND WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT AND IT'S USED SO OFTEN. TO. SUPPRESS THE CURRENT WAGES OF WORKERS BOMB YOU KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR JOB TO A ROBOT. IF WE DEMAND A REASONABLE WAGE. ITS USE TO TO CHANGE THE NATURE OF EMPLOYEES TEND PET CONTRACTORS IT'S USED UNFORTUNATELY. AT AS A WAY I THINK TO TO PUT DOWN MARKERS. BUT THERE'S A CERTAIN SENSE OF REALITY WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH THAT AYE TO REMIND FOLKS CONSTANTLY. I REMEMBER. AS WE WENT TOWARDS TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE WHICH HAS SOME SUCCESS AS FAR AS. I'M UNBIASED POLICING AND AND READ CAMERA LIGHTS RIGHT. AND THAT pTHING IN IN THERE SOME POSITIVE TO THE YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING GET PULLED OVER FOR DRIVING WHILE BLACK OR BROWN JUST BECAUSE. YOUR EAR IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INTERSECTION BUT THEN CITIES TOOK AUDITOR'S DOWNS BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER CONCERNS PRIVACY CONCERNS ON THEY'D THEY'D KEPT GLITCHES YOU KNOW. I'M WE WE ENJOY AND APPRECIATE A HUMAN FACTOR I THINK A LOT OF WHAT WE JAIL AND I THINK THAT SOMETIMES. WE YOU KNOW. DON'T RECOGNIZE IT UNTIL IT'S GONE AND SO. I THINK I WHEN I LOOK AT MY GROCERY STORE AND I SEE SELF CHECK LINES. I'M NOT THE ONLY PERSON I MEAN I REFUSE TO GO TO A SUBJECT LINE. AND I'LL REMIND OUR UFCW MEMBERS PLEASE DON'T TELL ME HOW TO. TAKE AWAY YOUR JOB AND HOW TO USE THAT I REFUSE TO DO THAT. ARE ARE THE REALITY OF WHAT WE LIVE WITH AND AND IT'S NOT BEING ADDRESSED. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED WORKERS WERE GONNA CONTINUE TO NEED WORKERS. AND SO I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE COMING TO THE TABLE AND HAVING THIS DISCUSSION I THINK IT'S A NECESSARY DISCUSSION. I HOPE I'M THAT BUSINESS LIKEWISE WILL COME TO THE TABLE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION NOT JUST IMPOSE. A MOMENTARY SOLUTION AND AND SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE. I THINK YOU'RE CRAZY FORGET IN FRONT OF ALL DRIVERLESS CAR BUT. YEAH NOW I'LL I'LL I'LL I'LL I'LL LEAVE MY TRASH IN THE HANDS AT A TEAMSTER DRIVER ANYDAY. OVER A ROBOT SO. WITH THAT I'M THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO. OUR CONTINUED DISCUSSION THE SERENA. THEY DO IT JUST DAWNED ON ME NORMALLY BOTH OF THE LABOR COMMITTEES MEET ON WEDNESDAY. AND THIS AND THAT UP BEING A SPECIAL MEETING AND SO WE LIKE TO HAVE ANOTHER CRACK AT IT. ON A REGULAR SCHEDULE DAY REMEMBERS NO ONE EXPECTED COME TO LIVE COMMITTEE AND. THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU SHARED AND. KNOW THAT WE HEAR YOU AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL. BOTTOM TO THE POINT THAT WHICH IS MADE WE DO HAVE SOME EMPLOYER REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE COME FORWARD TO SAID THEY WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE I KNOW THAT THEY'D MET THIS WEEK. BOB WITH REPRESENTATIVES ON THE LABOR FEDERATION AND WE WANT TO CALL THEM FOR IT SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM OUR EMPLOYERS. AND THEIR INPUT INTO THIS CONVERSATION. AND AGAIN TO THOSE FROM MY LABOR PANEL AS WE ASK OF OUR. ACADEMIA PANEL IF YOU CAN STAY WILL BE SOME PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER. WE WOULD LIKE TO. HAD TO BE PRESIDENT THE THINGS THAT YOU WISH TO ADDRESS. BUT WE ARE PLEASED TO DAY TO HAVE. A REPRESENTING. THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP FOUNDATION BRIAN BRANNON AND UP FROM OUR OWN. TECHNET HERE. ANDREA DEVOTE AND WE WELCOME YOU BOTH AND WE'RE READY FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WHENEVER YOU ARE READY. GREAT DOESN'T THINK VERY MUCH. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ACTUALLY HONORED TO BE HERE MY NAME IS BRIAN BRANNEN I'M SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT WITH THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP US OF JUST A QUICK CLARIFICATION NOT OUR FOUNDATION WHICH IS A SEPARATE. ENTITY YES SIR. WE REPRESENT THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY COMPANIES WITH A PRESENCE IN SILICON VALLEY INTO PUBLIC POLICY ON THEIR BEHALF WERE ABSOLUTELY HONORED. TO BE HERE NOT LEAST BECAUSE WE TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE DISCUSSING ARE AMONG THE QUESTIONS OF OUR TIME AND WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING THEM IN FACT. OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN MONTHS OUR FOUNDATION RC THREE AND CITY THAT YOU MENTIONED HAS BEEN CONVENING MEMBERS OF YOUR STAFF OTHER STAFF OF OTHER MEMBERS IN COMMITTEES. SPECIFICALLY TO DISCUSS ISSUES AROUND THIS AND NOT TO NOT TO CONVEY A POINT OF VIEW BUT RATHER TO CONVENE VOICES FROM LABOR FROM ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS CONSUMER ADVOCATES ACADEMICS CERTAINLY TECHNOLOGISTS. TO BEGIN TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE ISSUES AND AND TO HELP YOUR STAFF GRAPPLE WITH THEM AS WELL SO. AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE VERY INVOLVED IN THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US WOULD LIKE TO DO IS TOUCH ON THREE POINTS DURING MY TESTIMONY FIRST. I JUST WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE OVERWHELMINGLY POSITIVE IMPACT THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS HAD OVER TIME IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR ECONOMY SECOND. SOMETIMES THOSE IMPACTS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT BEFORE THE FACT AND I WANNA SPEAK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT AND THEN THIRDLY FROM A POLICY INVENTION PERSPECTIVE. WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WORKFORCE BUT I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON THAT IF THAT'S AN AREA THAT WE SEE. AS AS VERY VERY PROMISING. SO FIRST IN GENERAL I REALLY HOPE THAT ONE OF OUR TAKEAWAYS TODAY. IS THAT THE DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE ECONOMY HAS OVER TIME GENERALLY BEEN OVERWHELMINGLY. POSITIVE. IT'S DRAMATICALLY INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. LEADING TO HIGHER INCOMES GREATER DEMAND AND NEW JOBS. IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN MEDIAN WAGES PARA PARDON ME. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME HAS ALSO INCREASED FROM JUST OVER TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO OVER SIX SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. FORCING INCREASE IN THE QUANTITY OF JOBS AS WELL AS THE QUALITY. IT ALSO GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS OF HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE COST ON CERTAIN INDUSTRIES AND CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES. WE FEEL IT IS ABSOLUTELY INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US TO INVEST IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EL WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE STERN BY THESE TRANSITIONS NOT JUST BECAUSE. THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF THOSE PEOPLES AT STAKE FIRST AND FOREMOST BEAT BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE NEED TO BRING TO BEAR THE ENERGIES OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THE MOST COMPETITIVE. PLACE THAT IT CAN BE. NOW TO LOOK TO THE FUTURE. THE BEST RESEARCH THE PRINT THAT'S BEEN DONE REGARDING A AYE AND THE FUTURE OF WORK POSES IMPORTANT QUESTIONS. BUT RATHER THAN PROVIDING ANSWERS IT LOOKS TWO SCENARIOS. THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD TO PREDICT THE FUTURE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO PROACTIVELY MAKE POLICY AND GET IT RIGHT. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE EXAMPLE OF THE TEN MINUTES IT WAS DEPLOYED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. MANY REASONABLE PEOPLE PERHAPS THE MOST REASONABLE PEOPLE. THOUGHT THAT THE ATM WAS GOING TO DECIMATE THE YEAR FRANKS OF BANK TELLERS. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. IN FACT THE NUMBER OF BANK TELLERS INCREASE OVER TIME AS BANKS HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BRANCHES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. AND RATHER THAN GOING TO LOWER QUALITY JOBS IT ENABLED THOSE TELLERS TO ENABLE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SO AGAIN WE SAW BOTH COUNTER INTUITIVELY MORE JOBS. AND HIGHER QUALITY JOBS. YEAH WELL YOU MIGHT HEAR LESS OF. ITS IT IN THE RECESSION. MANY OF THOSE RETAIL OUTLETS CLOSED. BECAUSE OF THE OVERALL IMPACT THE ECONOMY SINCE THAT TIME. WE'VE ALSO SEEN MOBILE BANKING COME IN AS A FORCE IN THOSE JOBS HAVEN'T COME BACK. MY POINT HERE IS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW. HOW A GIVEN TECHNOLOGY IS GOING TO IMPACT THE ECONOMY? AND WHEN. THE GOOD THING FROM OUR VIEW. IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN DO. BOTH TO LEVERAGE THE ENORMOUS POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A AYE. AND TO RALLY AROUND THOSE WHO BEAR THE COSTS IT'S SOMETHING WOULD BE CRITICAL. EVEN IF WE FROZE TODAY'S ECONOMY IN PLACE AS IT IS FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. AND THAT IS CREATING A NIMBLE WORLD CLASS WORKFORCE. WHAT IS THIS MEAN WELL? THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL I COULD GO INTO BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST RE SKILLING CONSTANT FEET CONSTANTLY RENEWING SKILLS AND THIS IS FOR EVERYONE AT EVERY POINT ON THE SKILLS SPECTRUM THAT'S FRANKLY FOR ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM. WHO NEED TO CONSTANTLY BE THINKING ABOUT WHERE WILL I BE IN FIVE YEARS? WITH AN ECONOMY THAT'S CHANGING SO QUICKLY WHAT SKILLS DO I NEED TO DEVELOP SUCH THAT IT'S NOT WHEN I LOSE MY JOB THAT SUDDENLY I'M LOOKING AROUND THINKING OH NO I'VE GOT TO RE SKILL. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'VE STRUGGLE TO FIND OUT FIND MODELS THAT WILL WORK. NOW THAT SAID WITH THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES SEVENTEEN IN OUR AREA OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS MATCHING THEM WITH EMPLOYERS. TO INFORM CURRICULA AND ALSO TO MATCH THEM WITH INTERNSHIPS AND JOB SHADOWING OPPORTUNITIES AND THE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES CERTAINLY IN THE RE SKILLING OF THE LABOR MOVEMENT HAS TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE IN APPRENTICESHIPS EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANELS. TODAY WE HAVE KHANACADEMY AND LINKED IN LEARNING AS TOOLS THAT ARE BROUGHT BETTER ACCESSIBLE FEDERAL LOW COST CANDIDLY WERE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEVERAGE THOSE TOOLS WELL. BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE MIX AND WE THINK THERE'S A BY A TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL THERE. THE RAPID CHANGE IN OUR ECONOMY ALSO REINFORCES JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR OUR KEY TWELVE SYSTEM PREPARE OUR STUDENTS FOR THE FUTURE. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EQUIP ALL STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ULTIMATE PROFESSIONS WITH SKILLS TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATING CONTRIBUTE. TO OUR ECONOMY AND SOCIETY IN HERE ON THAT BOBAK CONCERNS COMMENT AT THE HEARING SEVERAL WEEKS AGO AND ASSEMBLY PRIVACY. THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVE MORE STUDENTS STUDYING POTTERY IN CALIFORNIA THAN COMPUTER SCIENCE WE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THIS FRONT AND IT'S ALSO IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THIS STARTS. RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS ALSO A CRITICAL PIECE ON THE SEVENTH SUM. TO REALIZE THE GREAT POTENTIAL OF BENEFITS. WE'RE STILL. I RESPECT EXACTLY RIGHTS OF THAT CAME FROM THE THE GAP FROM THE INTERNET TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION. AND INNOVATION FOUNDATION OF WASHINGTON DC BASED A AND TO THE PRESIDENT ROBERT ATKINSON TESTIFIED AT THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE HEARING ON THIS TOPIC TWO WEEKS AGO. YEAH YEAH. YEAH. THERE IS A BILL THAT WOULD EXPAND FUNDING FOR. COMPUTER SCIENCE. EDUCATION IN OUR STATE AND MULTIPLE DISTRICTS AND. I KNOW THAT THE SILICON VALLEY GROUP HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THAT PERHAPS YOU ALL SUPPORTED SPONSORED A NOTE TECHNIQUES FOR WORKING VERY CLOSELY SALUTE AND ON THE NO AND AS A MATTER FACT OAKLAND OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED DISTRICT DEL SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE AMONG THE LEADERS. IN THIS SPACE PASSED SO THAT WE KNOW THE AUTHOR AND IF YOU WANT TALK TO YEAH YES SIR BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU CONNECT YES SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. SO IN SOME OF OVERALL OVERALL OVER TIME SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE BENEFITS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY WE KNOW THAT THEIR COSTS BUT FOR BOTH OF THOSE WERE IMPACTED BY THOSE COSTS. AND THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO BE MAKING THE NEW OF INNOVATION CAN. ECONOMY AND CALIFORNIA EDUCATION IS REALLY THE CENTER FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE FROM OUR FEW TO THANKS AGAIN FOR HAVING I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THE BILL WHO OUT THERE THINK YOU I AM I CAN STILL SAY GOOD MORNING BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT I'M STANDING BETWEEN PUBLIC COMMENT AND LUNCH. SO I'VE FIVE TRIED TO REDUCE MY TESTIMONY ASSEMBLY I COULD SAY ME TOO I CAN ALSO I ALSO WANNA START MY COMMENTS OFF. BY SAYING HOW ENCOURAGED I AM BY THE CONVERSATION THIS MORNING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN FOR I'M HAVING US HERE AT THE TABLE. AND REALLY. HOPE THAT THIS SENDS THE RIGHT MESSAGE THAT WE ARE HERE TO COLLABORATE WE ARE HERE TO SIT AT THE TABLE. AND WHERE I'M REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE. AND THRILLED TO BE WORKING OUT WITH NOT ONLY THE COMMITTEE. BUT THE THE PRIOR AYE WITNESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS GOING FORWARD. SO WITH THAT. TECHNET SO I'M. ANDREA TO MOW THE VICE PRESIDENT OF ATTACK NOT WHO I REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTY OF THE NATION'S LEADING TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION COMPANIES. OUR DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES DYNAMIC START UPS TO THE MOST ICONIC COMPANIES ON THE PLANET. AND WE REPRESENT MORE THAN THREE MILLION EMPLOYEES NATIONWIDE. ALL STARTED BY SAYING THE FUTURE OF WORK IS THE FUTURE OF EVERYTHING FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WORK IS THE REASON WE GET OUT OF BED EVERY MORNING. IT IS THE WAY WE SUPPORT OUR FAMILIES WE BUILD TOWARDS OUR DREAMS AND IS A CORE PART OF OUR SUBSTANCE CORE SENSE OF OURSELVES. WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME OF EXTRAORDINARY CHANGE. AS PRIOR WITNESSES US SORT OF REFER TO SOME ARE CALLING THIS THE FOURTH INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION OR THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU CALL IT. WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME WHERE EVERY INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT IS BEING IMPACTED BY BREAKTHROUGHS IN COMPUTING POWER. CAN ACTIVITY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND OTHER INNOVATIONS. THERE'S BEEN A CONVERSATION GOING ON GLOBALLY. AND NATIONALLY ON THE CONSEQUENTIAL STORY OF ROBOTICS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE REVERBERATIONS A MIGHT HAVE ON JOBS IN THE ECONOMY. IT IS UNDENIABLE THAT AUTOMATION AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WILL BRING ABOUT SUBSTANTIAL INNOVATION TO SEVERAL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. ECONOMISTS ARE HOPEFUL LIKE THAT LIKE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN THIS NEW ERA WILL CREATE AS MANY JOBS AS IT DISPLACES. TODAY A AYE AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE PRIMARILY USED IN INDUSTRY TO AUGMENT HUMANS IN SECTORS LIKE MANUFACTURING AND TRANSPORTATION. LARGELY FOCUSED AROUND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AND SAFETY. AN EQUALLY ARE BEING USED TO MAKE HUMAN SMARTER AND DOMAINS LIKE CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE BELIEVE IT'S INCUMBENT ON US AS LEADERS TO SPEND MORE TIME SHARING THE BENEFITS OF A AYE AND THE WAYS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS MAKING LIFE BETTER TODAY. NETFLIX AND AMAZON USE A AYE TO MAKE BETTER RECOMMENDATIONS. SOON THE SAME TECHNOLOGY WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE ALL OTHER ASPECTS OF DAILY LIFE FROM EDUCATION. TO CRIME PREVENTION AND AGRICULTURE TO HEALTH CARE. AGAIN IF YOU LOOK AT HUMAN HISTORY ANYTIME THERE'S BEEN SOME MAJOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION YOU ULTIMATELY HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PRODUCTIVITY. WHICH THEN CREATES THE NEED FOR A NEW SET OF INDUSTRIES AND JOBS. TECHNOLOGY IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD. IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH IT THE MAKES THE DIFFERENCE. TECHNOLOGY CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS STREAMLINED PROCESS WORK FLOWS AND INNOVATIONS CAN CHANGE THE WAY WE LIVE WHICH CONSEQUENCE LOOK CONSEQUENTLY ALLOWS US TO START TO PUT. AND A PIPE PEOPLE TO ISSUES AND PROBLEMS THAT WERE UNIQUELY CAPABLE OF DOING AND SOLVING. THIS NEW REVOLUTION OFFERS BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES HOWEVER IT ALSO CREATES A HIGH DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY FOR POLICY MAKERS AND REGULATORS TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH THE RAPID PACE OF CHANGE. IT'S EASIER TO IDENTIFY THE BUSINESSES OR THE INDUSTRIES AND JOB FUNCTIONS THAT WELL OR COULD BE REPLACED OR BETTER SERVED BY INNOVATION INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND AUTOMATION. IT IS MUCH HARDER TO IMAGINE THE THINGS THAT WILL BE BORN OUT OF THAT INNOVATION AND THE NEW INDUSTRIES AND JOB FUNCTIONS THAT CAN AND WILL EMERGE. TOGETHER WE MUST FOCUS ON THE WORK FORCE. THIS STARTS WITH PRE K. AND K. THROUGH TWELVEEDUCATION. IN THE U. S. ALONE THERE ARE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OPEN TECHNOLOGY JOBS BUT OUR UNIVERSITIES PRODUCE ONLY ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND SCIENCE GRADUATES A YEAR. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS RECENTLY RELEASED IN CALIFORNIA. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SIXTY NINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT OPEN COMPUTING JOBS THAT'S THREE POINT FIVE TIMES THE AVERAGE DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA. YET CALIFORNIA ONLY HAD FOUR THOUSAND TWENTY NINE COMPUTER SCIENCE GRAD SCAN PETER SCIENCE GRADUATES IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. WE NEED TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW INVESTING IN AREAS SUCH AS STEM EDUCATION AND CREATING APPRENTICESHIPS AS PASTOR CAREER READINESS. AT THE SAME TIME WE MUST CREATE PROGRAMS TO GIVE TODAY'S WORKFORCE THE SKILLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED AND ADAPT TO ONGOING TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY COMPANIES OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES FOR EDUCATING THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE. THEY INVEST IN TRAINING EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS INTERNS AND APPRENTICES TO DRIVE GROWTH AND INNOVATION WHICH IN MANY CASES AMOUNTS TO SPECIALIZED INSTRUCTION AND HANDS ON EXPERIENCE. THAT CAN'T BE OBTAINED AT EVEN THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITIES. OUR LEADERS. PUBLIC AND PRIVATE A LIKE YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING TO ADOPT SMART. ADOPTIVE AND LONG RANGE STRATEGIES THAT FOSTER INNOVATION ENHANCE GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS. PROMOTE JOB GROWTH AND RETENTION AND HELP BUILD HIGHLY SKILLED WORKFORCES OF TODAY AND THE FUTURE. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING OF MEMBER MAN MANY CONVERSATIONS AND TECHNET STANDS READY TO WORK TOGETHER. ON THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY WE LOOK FOR FUTURE DISCUSSION. YOU. BUT YOU KNOW I IT COULD WELL EVERY PANEL I THINK WE HEARD THAT THERE IS A TENSION. BETWEEN. INNOVATION. SAFETY. JOB ATTENTION. AND NEW JOB CREATION AND. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY. OR ADD ANY NEW THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS TENSION THAT. AS I THINK EVERY SPEAKER HAS SAID WE HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH THIS THAT THIS SHOULD NOT BE AN EITHER OR THING. THIS IS AN INNOVATION AT THE AT THE EXPENSE OF JOBS BUT SHOULD BE INNOVATION THAT MAKES JOBS SAY FOR. RESERVE JOBS AND CREATES NEW JOBS ANYTHING THAT YOU ALL ADD TO THE MENU OF WHAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY. I THINK THE OTHER REASON REPEAT IN A CONSUMER REPORT THAT SUB AND CITED A COUPLE OF TIMES REALLY CAPTURES I THINK A LOT OF THE PROMISE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WAYS THAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT IT. WE CAN SEE THAT IT THAT IN A NUMBER OF SECTORS INCLUDING HEALTH CARE INCLUDING A INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THEY'RE GOING TO BE A TONE OF OPPORTUNITIES. IN THE COMING TEN TO TWENTY YEARS OR SO I DEFINITELY THINK THAT. THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHERE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN THOSE PLACES. AROUND WHAT THE SAME TIME SERVE LOOKING LOOKING THOSE INDUSTRIES WHERE THERE'S GOINGTO BE SOME DISPLACEMENT AND THINKING ABOUT HOW WE PREPARE NOT JUST THE FOLKS WERE CURRENTLY IN THOSE JOBS BUT BUT THEIR CHILDREN ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. TO BE PREPARED FOR THE JOBS ARE GOING TO BE AROUND IN IN TEN YEARS. I JUST MIGHT ALSO ADD ON ONE OF THE THEMES I AGREE THAT THAT THOSE THOSE ARE THE SAME THEMES THAT WE HEARD OUT OF THE AUDIENCE. I'M BUT I THINK IT'S THE ENGAGEMENT WITH WORKERS AND PROVIDING THE SOLUTIONS AS I THINK IT WAS. PERHAPS TIAS IT'S THAT IT'S THE SORT OF INTEGRATION AND THE CO EXISTING OF TECHNOLOGY AND WORKERS I'M NOT JUST BLANKETING A SOLUTION. BECAUSE WE THINK IT SHOULD BE SO BUT IT'S BACKUP COLLABORATION THAT WILL PROVIDE EFFICIENCIES. THROUGH TECHNOLOGY BUT YET STILL SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE SO TO ME I THINK THAT'S A COMMON THREAD. THAT SHOULD BE HIGHLIGHTED. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT IT THAN THAT I'M A I'M A WHAT WE DON'T DO ABOUT A KIND OF PERSON RIGHT I'M I'M LOOKING OUT I SEE I SEE DOUG FROM THE TEAMSTERS ICT IF MESS YEAH YOU GOT SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP HERE WE ARE TECHNICALLY? WE DIVIDED THE ROOM GET IT ALL SORTED OUT ALL FAITH I MEAN LIKE THAT I MEAN LIKE IN THE ROOM AND SORT OF HOW THE GUY GOT EXCITED I SAY WE WILL PUT OUR BY IN A ROOM. AND SORTED OUT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE LEADERS OF LABOR WE HAVE THE LEADERS OF TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS HERE. WE HAVE SOME OF THE FINEST INSTITUTIONS IN ACADEMIA WHO PROVIDED US SOME SOME SOME STORIES AND SOME DATA. ON THE WE GOING TO ABOUT A WEEK AGO AND WE CAN TO TAKE CARE OF THIS RIGHT HERE AND NOW AND SO HOW DO WE MAKE THIS A SPECIFIC THING. THAT WASN'T JUST OUT A HAD A HEARING AND THEN NOTHING HAPPENED BUT WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I MEAN FROM MY VIEW ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS AS IT WERE ᅍING DISCUSSION AT A TIME WHEN IT'S IT'S AN ODD I MET MY STATEMENT TO SIR. BOOK AND IF YOU WOULD AS YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO ABOUT IT WOULD YOU BOTH TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE PREPARED O DO WHICH IS COMMITTED TO DUKE TO HELP. MAKE THAT HAPPEN YEAH SO CERTAINLY WE WAIT THE LEADERSHIP GROUP HAVE BEEN COMMITTED TO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS WHERE WHAT WITH ALL THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS I MEAN EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES. DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHICH ONES ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL WHICH BUSINESS MODELS ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL HOW THEY'RE GONNA BE DEPLOYED WHAT THE IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES. IT'S THAT UNCERTAINTY NOW BUSINESS LEADERS HAVE TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THAT CONTEXT AS TO POLICYMAKERS SO IN OUR VIEW. WITH THEIR LIVES TO MOST OPPORTUNITY IS TO TAKE ACTION WHERE AS OTHERS AND ABSOLUTELY CLEAR RETURN TODAY. TWO YEARS FROM NOW FIVE YEARS FROM NOW TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND WHERE WE HAVE I THINK VERY BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG ALL OF THESE FACTORS IS THAT SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AT EACH POINT. CRADLE TO CAREER IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL AND EQUIP BOTH FOR CERTAINLY FOR COMPANIES IN A QUESTION ABOUT THAT AS FOR WORKERS AS WELL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL BE THERE. SO THAT'S GONNA. GO WORK FOR SEEMS TO BE A PLACE WHERE WE CAN REACH CONSENSUS VERY SOON YOUR LEGISLATION I THINK SPEAKS OF THE. SO I DO NOT THINK ABOUT THIS LITTLE MORE SIMPLY WHEN MY FIFTY YEAR OLD DOCTOR GETS REALLY OVERWHELMED WITH CHEMISTRY WHICH I CAN EVEN BEGIN TO HELP HER WITH UNFORTUNATELY. I'M AYE STUFF AYE TELLER START TO LOOK AT IT LIKE A POSSIBLE RATE WHICH PIECES DO YOU HAVE WHAT DO YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S DECIDE WHICH PIECES ARE MISSING. I I SORT OF LOOK AT THIS IS NOT SAME WAY. WE NEED TO START TO LOOK AT WHAT PIECES ARE THERE. SO THAT WE CAN TRULY IDENTIFY WHAT PIECES ARE MISSING AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO IS HELPING TO PUT THE PUZZLE TOGETHER. SO MADE INVITATION FOR US ALL GET A ROOM AND SORTED OUT I'LL SPONSOR THE LIVES NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M HUNGRY AND WANT TO GO TO LUNCH BECAUSE. I THINK IF WE DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING EVERYONE WHO'S IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW BE IN A ROOM AND SAY OKAY WHAT WE GONNA DO ABOUT TO COME UP WITH THREE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WHETHER IT'S WORKFORCE OF SOMETHING ELSE. WE'VE MISSED THE OPPORTUNITY AND I DON'T WANT TO MISS AN OPPORTUNITY SO APPRECIATE YOU SAYING YOU WANT BE AT THE TABLE CINEMA GONZALEZ FLETCHER. I THINK. I JUST. ONE ECHO YOUR EAR STATEMENT I MEAN WE KNOW FOR BUSINESS TO BE SUCCESSFUL YOU NEED CONSUMERS. YOU KNOW WE WE NEED TO HAVE FOLKS WHO WORK IS IMPORTANT. AYE I GET VERY NERVOUS WHEN WE LOOK AT SOLUTIONS SAID INCLUDE. JUST PAIN PEOPLE NOT WORK. AND SO I I THINK THAT HAVING SOME DISCUSSIONS AROUND SOME UNIVERSAL VALUES. AT ABOUT THAT TRANSITION I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT HAS. REALLY FRUSTRATED ME IS THIS KIND OF LAKE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SERVICE BASED SOCIETY OR WHATEVER WE HAVE NOW ARE BUT WE HAVE HAD. AND WE'RE GONNA JOHN TO THIS COMPLETELY AUTOMATED SOCIETY WITH NO WORKERS AND WE KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE. AND GRAND WE ALL TALK IN HYPERBOLE HERE SO SOMETIMES YOU NOW WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THAT. AND. AND I HAVE A HARD TIME BECAUSE I I THINK MY GUT REACTION AS A FORMER LABOR LEADER IS TO BE LIKE WHY DON'T WANT ANY OF US THEN YOU KNOW IF IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK LIKE THAT WILL WE DON'T pOPPOSE EVERY. DRIVERLESS VEHICLE BILL. WHICH I HAVE AND AND YOU KNOW I MEAN IT YOU KNOW JUST ON AND ON THE FACT THAT THESE ARE JOB KILLERS. THAT'S NOT PRODUCTIVE AT THEIR AND I'M I'M VERY WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT I THINK HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT THAT'S RIGHT LIKE.

WITH EVERYBODY AT THE TABLE TO SAY YOU KNOW. IT'S NOT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO BACK TO THE PRE INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY. OR OR THAT THE INDUSTRIAL AGE AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO. ROBOTIC GAUGE SO SO HOW DO WE. HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER IN IN FACT THE TRAINING STUFF IN PARTICULAR I THINK I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST WORKFORCE TRAINING I'M FOR THE EXISTING WORK FORCE THAT WE CAN KIND OF? WAIT OUT THE TIME I THINK ON ON ON SOME FOLKS THE WORKFORCE BUT OUR NEXT GENERATION LIKE YOU SAID OF KIDS THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAINED FOR THESE JOBS EITHER AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC I MEAN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE.

IMPACTED THEIR WORKPLACE WHAT IT WAS NURSES ACTORS OF THAT. YOU KNOW WORKERS AT PGA AN E. IBEW BUILDING TRADES. ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T THINK WE HAVE REALLY SEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS TOUCHED SO MANY OF OUR MEMBERS LIVES. AS TECHNOLOGY AND IT WAS NOT JUST. WE'RE AFRAID OF THE ROBOT APOCALYPSE THERE WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO HAD COME UP THROUGH THE FILM INDUSTRY WHO HAD BEEN FILM EDITORS WHEN THERE WAS FILM.

HELLO I'M DRILL COOK WITH THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION UP FIRST AGAIN WANT TO THANK BOTH OF THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY LABOR COMMITTEES WERE HAVING THIS. DISCUSSION HERE TODAY IT'S ONE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO US IS MANUFACTURES WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE OF AUTOMATION AND LABOR FOR ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY YEARS NOW IN EARNEST. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS A TRANSITION OF A TO A LABOR FORCE THAT IS A MORE HYBRIDIZED WHERE WE HAVE WORKERS AND OUT ROBOTS WORKING TOGETHER BUT WE SEE OUR OUR OUR. HUMAN LABOR MOVING UPSTREAM TO HIGHER SKILLED A HIGHER VALUE TO MORE COMPLEX WORK. ARE. THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE THE MORE WE NEED HELP IS DEALING WITH OUR OUR OUR PIPELINE PROGRAMS WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH. PEOPLE COMING THROUGH THE PIPELINE BETTER EQUIPPED WITH THE TECHNICAL SKILLS OUGHT TO JUMP INTO THESE MORE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING PROGRAMS BUT WE ALSO ARE LOOKING FOR MORE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE CAN ASSIST US IN RETRAINING AND UPSCALING WORKERS AYE SO THAT THEY CAN FOR PHIL. THESE RULES THAT WE HAVE BETTER JOBS THAT ARE FAR HIGHER SKILLED HIGHLY PAID AND HIGHLY STABLE. A AND AN ADDITIONAL TENSION. AS DID IN ADDITION TO ONES THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THURMAN MENTIONED EARLIER IS THAT AUTOMATION FOR MANUFACTURERS IS CRITICAL TO ALSO HITTING THE THE GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SET. IN REGARDS TO UGH CLEANER A GREENER JOBS HITTING OUR ENERGY ADMIT THAT OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY GOALS WELLS ARE ODD GREENHOUSE GAS AND EMISSIONS GOALS FOR ALL OF THESE. ARE. COME FOOT BEING COMPETING INTERESTS HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER OUT TO SUPPORT OUR ECONOMY MAKE CALIFORNIA GREATER SO AQ HOPING TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE ON THIS THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON RENEWING MY NAME STAND SOUTH OF SOME WITH COMMUNICATION WORKERS ALSO BUT I'M SPEAKING AS A A. SPLICING TECHNICIAN. MYSELF I'M A CONSTRUCTION SPLICER AND I HAVE A A BROTHER WHO'S A MAINTENANCE PLACER. AND OUR EXPERIENCE ALTHOUGH THE WHITE PICTURE ON TECHNOLOGY AND HOW IT'S DISPLACED ARE ABOUT WORKERS SINCE BEEN REALLY. A TRAGEDY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE AUTOMATED PROMPTS THE OFF SHORING AND OUR CLOSURE OF CALL CENTERS. AND THAT'S IMPACT THE CALIFORNIA TREMENDOUSLY THEY MOVE HIM. SNOW EAST AND THEN THEY MOVE THEM OVERSEAS AND AT SOME OF IT SO MUCH OF ITS AUTOMATED THAT IT'S REALLY A. AFFECTING OUR. CUSTOMERS THE OTHER PART IS THE NEW SYSTEMS THAT THE COMING IN. THE WIRELESS HOME PHONE. A A LOT OF THE WIRELESS PRODUCTS WE STILL WORK ON CABLE COPPER AND OPTICAL FIBER MYSELF I SPICE AND. NO WORKING BOTH. WHAT I'VE DISCOVERED IS THAT THOSE SYSTEMS THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO BRING IN AND OVERLY WHICH A WIRELESS? THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH LED TO THE TRAGEDY THAT HAPPENED WHICH CLAIMED OR FORTY LIVES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE EFFECTS OF THESE FIRES AND NATURAL AND MAN MADE DISASTERS WILLING TO SEE THAT INCREASE. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT GIVEN THE CAPACITY THE ABILITY TO REALLY MAINTAIN THOSE NETWORKS. ANOTHER MOVING TO A WIRELESS PLATFORM WHERE I'VE SEEN AND IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME TO FUKUSHIMA. YOU GO TO A HURRICANE AS SANDY IN THE EAST COAST AND YOU SEE PEOPLE LINING UP. AT PAY PHONES. BECAUSE THEIR WIRELESS TOWERS WENT DOWN IN SOME CASES IT'S THE TELEPHONE POLES THAT BURN THEN THERE'S NO COPPER CONNECTIVITY. MY POINT IS THIS THAT A LOT OF THESE CORPORATIONS. ARE PUTTING ALL THEIR MONEY INTO THIS PRUDENT PERSON AT THE FIRST RESPONDER NETWORK THE EMERGENCY NETWORK. WELL THERE'S THIS THING CALLED A. I GUESS IT'S PREEMPTION BUT IT'S ALSO CALLED ANOTHER TERM FOR IT IS BRUTAL PREEMPTION I THINK IT'S CALLED. ANYWAY IT'S THE ONE WHERE THEY. USE THE NETWORK THEY TAKE OVER THE NETWORK AND THEN. ONLY FIRST RESPONDED TRAFFIC IT'S ALLOWED ON IT. AND LOT OF OUR CUSTOMERS WHO ARE TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE LOVE ONES AREN'T ABLE TO. AND THE FACT IS THE NETWORK DOESN'T EVEN HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THEM WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE THINK THAT THEY'RE NOT PUTTING ENOUGH INVESTMENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT. THEY NO LONGER OPERATING REDUNDANT I MEAN. WHO WHAT I GUESS YOU'D CALL READINGS WHERE YOU HAVE POINT NAY WHERE THE COMMUNITY IS AND POINT B. WHICH IS THE WORLDWIDE NETWORK? THEY'RE ALL IN ONE CABLE AND A FARMER IS DIGGING A DITCH YOUR DIGGING A TELEPHONE POLE IN HIS. NORTH FORTY AND HE HITS ONE OF OUR CABLES ANY KNOCKS DOWN TWO OR THREE OF OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE I COME FROM ANY KNOCKS DOWN A COUPLE OF. CELL TOWERS SO THAT'S A CONCERN OF A RURAL COMMUNITIES WE'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT IS AUTOMATION GOES FOR TECHNOLOGY GOES FORWARD. WITH THE ONES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND WE CARE ABOUT OUR CUSTOMERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. POWER THANK EVERYONE WHO GAVE UP PUBLIC COMMENT. I DON'T THINK THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE STAFF OF BOTH COMMITTEES AND UP ALL THE PANELISTS UNKNOWNS ALSO THINK CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THE TEAMSTERS. SUPPORTED DEVELOPING THE AGENDA FOR TODAY BUT CLEARLY WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
