MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. ALLOWING MEDIA TO PRY TESTIMONY IT WITH MY WITNESSES WHO ARE. GOING BE CATCHING FLIGHTS LATER TODAY I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS WOULD LIKE THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE TO ADOPT A THREE POINT ONE SIX MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION TO THE DEPARTMENT. OF SOCIAL SERVICES FOR A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE CURRENTLY SERVE OVER THREE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SURVIVORS EACH YEAR. WHO RELY ON ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY? WHILE THE SIZE OF THIS IS SURVIVOR POPULATION IS DECREASING AS A AS THEY AGE AND THEY PASSED AWAY. THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS NEEDING ASSISTANCE IS ALSO GROWING. THIS ONE TIME APPROACH APPROPRIATION ESTABLISH A GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION. BY PROVIDING SERVICES SUCH AS HOME CARE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CASE MANAGEMENT HOME DELIVERED MEALS TRANSPORTATION AND EMERGENCY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS IN CALIFORNIA ARE INCREASINGLY FRAIL AND VULNERABLE. AND THEY HAVE UNMET NEEDS RELATED TO HOME CARE NUTRITION TRANSPORTATION HOUSING. EXISTING AGING COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES ARE INADEQUATE AND ADDITIONAL STATE RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS CAN LIVE OUT. THEIR FINAL YEARS WITH DIGNITY. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS ACTUALLY HARRINGTON MANAGER OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS THE JEWISH FAMILY SERVICE OF SAN DIEGO. AND NANCY VOLPERT DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC POLICY STRATEGIC IN THIS YEAR INITIATIVES WITH JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES OF LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M NANCY VOLPERT I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF JFS AS AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIVING MENTION. WE ARE THE OLDEST CHARITY AND LOS ANGELES AND WE PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES TO PEOPLE OF ALL BACKGROUNDS AGES ETHNICITIES. EACH YEAR IN CAO IN LOS ANGELES SERVING ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR. AND WE'RE HERE TODAY WITH THE REALLY URGENT REQUEST. LAST WEEK AS YOU KNOW AS THE ANNUAL HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY HERE AT THE CAPITOL. AND MANY OF YOU SAW AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH YOUR OFFICE HONEST FEWER AND FEWER SURVIVORS WERE ABLE TO MAKE THE TRIP THIS YEAR. THEY'RE BECOMING MORE FRAIL AND LESS ABLE TO TRAVEL AND WE SEE THIS REALITY EVERYDAY AT JFS. FORCING THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF THE LIFE FORGED IN TRAUMA. THESE. PEOPLE SURVIVED UNIMAGINABLE FOR. THE TEENAGERS AND CHILDREN WHO SURVIVED ARE NOW IN THEIR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES NO LONGER PROVIDING CARE FOR OTHERS BUT NEEDING CARE THEMSELVES. SO I THOUGHT I WOULD TELL YOU THE STORY OF ROSA ONE OF OUR CLIENTS. SO. YOU CAN SEE A PICTURE OF WHO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN NINETEEN FORTY WHEN RUSSELL WAS TWELVE. THE HOLOCAUST HER AND HER FAMILY OUT OF HER HOME IN AUSTRIA. SHORTLY AFTER THAT. UP HER PARENTS WERE BOTH EXECUTED. EVENTUALLY AFTER THE WAR SHE AND HER HUSBAND MADE IT TO THE UNITED STATES. SHE'S NOW NINETY YEARS OLD. SHE'S VERY FRAIL SHE'S GOT MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING MYELOMA. AND SHE HAS ONGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND HEALTH TREATMENTS AND MEDICAL ISSUES. SHE ALSO LOST HER HUSBAND FIVE YEARS AGO. SHE IS. SUPPORTED EMOTIONALLY BY HER SON AND DAUGHTER IN LAW. BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES EITHER TO MEET ALL HER NEEDS. SHE NEEDS RICK ASSISTANCE WITH PERSONAL CARE. WITH HOUSEHOLD CHORES. SHE'S ON MEDI CAL SHE RECEIVES IIHS ASKS AT STILL NOT ENOUGH FOR HER TO REMAIN SAFELY AT HOME. SHE LIVES ON A LOW FIXED INCOME CAN'T AFFORD HER GROCERIES. I CAN'T AFFORD BASIC LOADING SUPPLIES. THANKS SIR JOSEPH HER JAFFA SOCIAL WORKER SHE'S RECEIVING EVERY BIT OF HELP THAT WE CAN FIND. PRIVATE PUBLIC STATE FEDERAL WE CAN FIND IT SHE'S ACCESSING IT. BUT SHE'S JUST ONE OF A THOUSAND SURVIVORS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING CARE TO EACH YEAR AT JEFF SLI. AND THEY'RE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL SURVIVORS FOR ON WAIT LISTS FOR CARE FROM US. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THOSE RESOURCES. AND SO AS WE LOOK AROUND THE STATE AND WE SEE THE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS LIVING IN POVERTY. WE THINK THAT WITH YOUR HELP AND THE CALIFORNIA HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS ASSISTANCE FUND WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES. IN THEIR LIVES THAT ARE. NEARING THEIR AND. BUT. THEY DESERVE TO LIVE IT OUT WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. THEY SURVIVE TRAUMA LIKE NONE OF US CAN EVER IMAGINE. AND WE OWE THEM AN. A DUTY OF CARE AND RESPECT AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU.

WE WILL NOW RETURN TO THE TOP OF OUR AGENDA HERE TODAY. AND START WITH ISSUE ONE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MERCY. MY NAME IS MATT SCHULER I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THE OFFICES SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. AND. WERE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY TO DISCUSSSOME OF OUR PROPOSALS. AND ALSO TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE AUTOMATION PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO FOR THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY. THERE'RE THREE. PROJECTS THAT YOU'D LIKE STATUS UPDATES ON. IF YOU DON'T MIND I'D LIKE TO START WITH THE EPT PROJECT. AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THAT TIME I HAVE. STEAM DUDLEY OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THAT AREA TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE. CHAIR COMMITTEE EBT SIGNED A CONTRACT WITH FIS IN OUR JUNE OF TWENTY SIXTEEN POOR EBT SERVICES WE SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF BEGINNING. TO DO ALL THE WORK TO TRANSITION FROM OUR CURRENT VENDOR TO THAT NEW VENDOR. ALONG THE WAY WE COUNTED SOME CHALLENGES AND IT RESULTED IN A. DETERMINATION THAT WE NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TIME SO WHILE YOUR AGENDA SAYS THAT IT WAS PLANNED TO BE IMPLEMENTED JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT DATE HAS BEEN MOVED. UP TO JUNE OF THIS YEAR. ACTUALLY THE WEEKEND IS JUNE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. THERE WAS NO IMPACT THE BUDGET OVER THAT SHIFT WAS JUST A SHIFT IN THE SCHEDULE. SO ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CAUSING THE DELAY HAVE BEEN COMPLETED WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LAST STAGES OF USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING. ADAM. AND WHAT ELSE ARE YOU A TI USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED THIS WEEK NEXT WEEK OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS UP IN S. WILL BE HERE TO DO THEIR ACCEPTANCE TESTING. AND THEN THE FOLLOWING WEEK THERE WILL BE TESTING WITH THE CONSORTIA TO TEST THE SYSTEM AND AND. AND THEN THE. THAT WILL BE OUR LAST TEST AND THEN WILL BE READY TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER TO GO LIVE OR NOT GREAT. THANK YOU. PERFECT. AND THEN NEXT I THINK WE'D LIKE TO COVER THE A CASE MANAGEMENT INFORMATION AND A ROLLING SYSTEM AND I ALSO HAVE OUR. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THAT AREA CYNTHIA TALKATIVE BUT NOT TODAY EITHER OKAY SO SEEMS TO I THINK THE THE ITEM OF THE BIGGEST NOTE WE'RE HER LAST YEAR WAS WE WERE IN PROCUREMENT. WE'VE ACTUALLY COMPLETED A A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT. AND WE HAVE. SELECTED. A NEW VENDOR. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE HAD DONE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VENDOR AND ARE MOVING FORWARD TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE WITH REGARDS TO THE CONTRACT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A PIECE CONTRA EXECUTION DATE OF APPROXIMATELY JULY ONE. THAT WILL INITIATE TRANSITION PERIOD WE HAVE AN ESTIMATED TIME OF EIGHT MONTHS FOR TRANSITION FROM. V. I CURRENT VENDOR TO THE NEW AND I KNOW SERVICES UNDER. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THAT STARTING IN JULY THAT WE WOULD BE DONE. ROUGHLY AND THE JANUARY FEBRUARY TIME PERIOD. AND WE'RE LOOKING JUST JUST FOR NO FOR LOOKING AT DOING IT. IN A PHASED APPROACH IS NOT LIKE. GO ALL THE WAY TO THE AND IN THAT IT TO SWITCHES WILL BE LOOKING AT. TRANSFERRING OR TRANSITIONING. SERVICES FROM ONE VENDOR TO ANOTHER IN ORDER TO HAVE A METHODICAL APPROACH OVER THE EIGHT MONTH PERIOD. GREAT. I THINK THE THIRD PROGRAMS CWS CARES IF IT. AND. I WAS WAITING FOR OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER THAT AREA TO. COME IN AND HELP ME PROVIDE THE TESTIMONY BUT I'M WE CAN GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THAT. SHE MUST BE HAVING PARKING ISSUES POTENTIALLY. SO THE SICK. OR ELEVATOR ISSUES THAT BUT YOU. SO ANYWAY WITHOUT. FURTHER DELAY ON THE CW YES CARES PROJECT IS THE EFFORT THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS UNDERTAKEN. ON BEHALF OF. OR SPONSOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND ALSO IN VERY DIRECT COORDINATION WITH THE COUNTY IT'S TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. CHILD WELFARE WORKERS THE TOOLS THEY NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN. AND. BUT LAST YEAR WE GAVE YOU. INFORMATION ON THE CHANGE IN THE APPROACH OF THAT PROJECT WHERE BEFORE WE ARE APPROACHING IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF USING A MONOLITHIC. APPROACH TO PROCURE SINGLE VENDOR. WE HAVE NOW TAKEN THE APPROACH TO DO YOU THINK A. ITERATIVE APPROACH INVOLVING MULTIPLE VENDORS AND AND BUILDING MODULES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THOSE DIGITAL SERVICES. SO I'M. WHERE WE CURRENTLY STAND RIGHT NOW IS WE HAVE DELIVERED? THEY. A MEASURE OF FUNCTIONALITY HOW. AS SPECIFIC TO INTAKE I'M IN TERMS OF SNAPSHOT I'M WHAT WE CALL SNAPSHOT AND THAT IS AN ELASTIC SEARCH FUNCTION. THAT ALLOWS USERS TO BE ABLE TO RUN SEARCHES MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN THE EXISTING. CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. SO THE. BUT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF NOW I MAKING THAT MORE EXTENSIBLE TO A WIDER RANGE OF USERS AND THAT ULTIMATELY THE DIET ENTIRE POPULATION OF STATE USERS. ARM. IN ADDITION WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON. THAT FUNCTIONALITY FOR. CASE MANAGEMENT FOR. DE AYE CHILD AND ADOLESCENT NEEDS AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT WHICH IS PART OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM. WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT AND OTHER DIGITAL SERVICES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ALSO DONE IS WE HAVE BEEN FACED WITH SOME MEASURE OF CHALLENGES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE DELIVER. WORKING CODE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT IS WE'VE HAD. SEVERAL ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE. WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IS WHAT WE CALL MORE BUILDING THE FACTORY. SO WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO RELEASE THAT CODE. TO THE WORKERS ON THAT ERROR BRACED BASIS. SO WE HAVE. UNDER WAY UP A LOT OF TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT PIPELINE SAID THAT WE HAVE AUTOMATED PROPAGATION OF ENVIRONMENTS. AUTOMATED TESTING AND BEING ABLE TO FACILITATE. THE DELIVERY OF THAT CODE.% SO I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'LL NOTE IN THE AGENDA IS THAT. WE ARE WORKING TO. WE ARE WORKING TO FIX. CASE OF DELIVERY. AND AGAIN REALLY DELIVER THAT VALUABLE WORKING CODE TO THE PEOPLE THAT NEED IT. GREAT. BERMAN FINANCE. ELIOT. I DON'T THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE PARTICULAR ISSUES TO RAISE FOR THE COMMITTEE ON THE PROJECTS WITHIN OVERSIZE PORTFOLIO THAT ARE DISCUSSED HERE. BUT JUST AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA WE DO KNOW THAT THE COST FOR THE CW S. CARES PROJECT IN THE COMPLETION DATE. HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE IT'S WHICH pMONOLITHIC APPROACH TO THE AGILE THAT WAS REASONABLE WITH A NEW WAY OF COMPLETING PROJECTS IN THE STATE NEEDED TO ADJUST TO THAT BUT NOW IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF YEARS SINCE THAT TRANSITION. IN MAY MAKE SENSE TO ASK FOR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON WHAT THE TRUE COST MIGHT BE. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. NOW THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM IF I MAY JUST TAKE A SECOND I'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH IT. DOCTOR ARAMBULA HERE HARPER MATHIS RUBIO. WOULD. QUORUM. IF I MAY VOMIT JUST TO ADD TO THAT POINT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO WORK ON A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT UPDATE. THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE A LOT OF THE DETAILS SURROUNDING. IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE ADDITIONAL PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE IN TERMS OF DEFINING. WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE BUILDING? SO TAKING THE ITERATIVE APPROACH. WE DON'T WANT TO DO AS MUCH PLANNING AND DIFF DEFINITION OF REQUIREMENTS AS THERE IS WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD EVERYTHING IN ONE SINGLE BIG BANG. BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BE DONE. AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF THE WORKERS. SO WE'RE PUTTING SOME ADDITIONAL EFFORT INTO PLANNING OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY IN ACUTE AND I CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT. AND WHEN SO WE'RE HAVE JUST STARTED THAT PROCESS FOR THE S. P. ARE WE PLAN ON HAVING IT. SOMETIME THIS SUMMER MIDSUMMER. IS THAT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SCHEDULED SO THAT'S GOING TO BE IN A VERY REVEALING IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING GOING FORWARD. INTO THE INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE ONE. SEEING NONE ALL BRING UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE HAVE. A FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT IF I CAN. IN LIGHT OF WANTING TRANSPARENCY IN THAT CONVERSATION IS THERE A POINT WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT COST. I'M HEARING TIMELINES BUT COST IS AS IMPORTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S AN UPDATE ON THE AGILE APPROACH AND. IF WE CAN EXPECT SOME COST ESTIMATES AND WHEN THOSE WOULD BECOMING. SO WE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A COST UPDATE FOR IS PART OF THE MAY REVISION WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET YEAR. AND THEN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN WITH THE SPR ARE GOING INTO IT LEND MORE TO. WHAT DOES THE OVERALL PROJECT LOOK LIKE AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS DEPENDENT OF STILL ON PLANNING THAT NEEDS TO OCCUR IN TERMS OF BUILDING WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT PROJECT BLUEPRINT? WHICH IS MORE OF WHAT DO WE EXPECT TO BUILD AND WENT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO PERFECT THANK YOU WHAT THE SEPARATELY ISSUE TOO I GET ALL HAVE CHRISTINE DUDLEY TICKETS THROUGH THE OVERVIEW. WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM. IT. SO THERE ARE THREE CURRENTLY SYSTEMS THAT. PROVIDE THE AUTOMATION FOR ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S LRC POURING CAO WIN. FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW WE'VE BEEN PLANNING TO. MIGRATE ELLER AND SEE FOR INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM. HOWEVER OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS DID NOT APPROVE OUR FUNDING REQUEST FOR THAT MIGRATION. AND SO OUR ACTIVITIES DID NOT BEGIN IN JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WE HAD ANTICIPATED. SO A CHANGE IN DIRECTION JUST OCCURRED IN DECEMBER AND WE HAVE NOT UPDATED THE BUDGET YET THOSE CHANGES WILL BE. COMPLETED IN THE MAY REVISION PROCESS. SO IT SEEMS THAT EPONA SUPPORT ARE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH IN DOING THIS OVER TIME. BUT. THEY WANTED MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING AND SO ON THAT BASIS THEY HAVE REQUIRED THE STATE COUNTIES TO ENTER AN EXTENDED PLANNING PHASE. USING THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT CONSULTANTS TO HELP US. DETERMINE THE APPROACH THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE COST ESTIMATES FOR ALL THE ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A SINGLE SYSTEM. TO THAT END IN JANUARY THEY APPROVED A REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR PLANNING. BUT AS WE BEGAN TO DO THOSE PLANNING ACTIVITIES THEY STILL BELIEVE WE WORK QUITE REACHING. THEIR GOAL OF COMPREHENSIVE PLANNING FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO THEY ASKED US TO ACCELERATE SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COW ONE ASSESSMENT AND TO EXTEND THAT PLANNING PHASE. WE HAVE. DONE THAT AND ON MARCH THIRTIETH WE SUBMITTED A NEW REQUEST FOR FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE PLANNING EFFORT. WE EXPECT THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR REVIEW OF THAT THIS WEEK WE HAVE WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM THEY KNEW WHAT WE WERE GOING TO SUBMIT BEFORE WE DID. AND ACTUALLY WE'VE BEGUN AS MUCH OF THAT WORK AS WE CAN BECAUSE THE TIME LINES ARE SO SHORT. THE TIMELINE THAT WAS IN YOUR SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA WAS DEVELOPED OVER A YEAR AGO WITH THIS EXTENDED PLANNING THERE ARE NUMBER OF THOSE FACES. THAT WE HAVE SHADED TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ANALYZING THE LRC FOR MIGRATION THE LONG TERM AND A NO CONSOLIDATED PORTAL ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE WITHIN THIS PLAN. PHASE. SO THE MAJORITY OF THE PLANNING AND ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES WILL BE COMPLETED THIS SUMMER AND WILL RESULT IN THE DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY AND UPDATED TIMELINE. AND NEW COST ESTIMATES THAT WE WILL INCLUDE IN THE PROJECT APPROVAL DOCUMENTS THAT WE WILL SUBMIT IN THE NOVEMBER. I KEPT IT CURRENT PLAN IS TO BEGIN THE FIRST PHASE OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT IN JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN. NEXT WE HAVE MISTER BLUNT. I THANK YOU AGAIN NOT TAUGHT PLAN DEPUTY DIRECTOR AT CDSS ON CONCUR WITH ON THIS DUDLEY'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE OVERALL APPROACH TO THE. CREATION THE CALCITE SYSTEM HOW ARE BUDGET WILL ESSENTIALLY BE UPDATED MADE TO REFLECT THIS MORE INTENSIVE PLANNING PROCESS OF REALLY NOTHING TO ADD THEIR. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE ISSUE AROUND STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IF YOU WOULD LIKE AT THIS TIME OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO MISTER HALE TO PRESENT ON THAT FIRST I THINK MR HELD IS PRESENTING NEXT. TO. BIRTH. WE MAKE A SPOT FUHRMAN YEAH VOTE. FOR FIFTY. SPICY. I'M IS CHAIR OF MY CARE WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY I'M ALSO HERE THOUGH ON BEHALF OF OTHER ADVOCATES FOSTER CARE ADVOCATES LEGAL SERVICE ADVOCATES. AM SOME OF CAN FOLKS IN THE FOOD POLICY COMMUNITY SOME OR ALL OF THIS FOR REQUESTING A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH A STAKEHOLDER WORKING GROUP. TO ADVISE THE ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES ON THE SYSTEM MIGRATION AS IT GOES FOR. WE THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. ENDEAVOR THAT THE STATE IS INVOLVED IN RIGHT NOW ONE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT. POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY POSITIVE IMPACTS FOR CLIENTS. AND THAT IS I THINK IT THE CENTER OF WHY WE'RE REQUESTING THE TBL IS BECAUSE WE DO THINK THAT HAVING THE VOICES OF CLIENTS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE. AND HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK ON THE GROUND AND HOW THEY WERE AND HOW OUR CLIENTS INTERFACE INTERACT WITH THEM. IS IS GOING TO MAKE THAT. THAT MIGRATION THAT MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES OUT. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ARE ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH IN A VARIETY OF PROJECTS OVER MANY YEARS PROBABLY MOST NOTABLY THE WORK AROUND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THAT'S VERY STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUPS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED THERE WHICH I THINK IN RETROSPECT REALLY QUITE BENEFICIAL TO THE PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE TO KIND OF ROLL OUT THAT WE DID FOR THAT. SO WE'D WE BRING NOT JUST EXPERIENCE OUR CLIENTS BUT I THINK WE ALSO CAN BRING THE EXPERIENCE OF. WORKING IN IT SYSTEMS TO THIS PROCESS QUITE EFFECTIVELY ARM AND I THINK AT THE BOTTOM WHAT WE'RE REALLY HOPING HERE IS THAT WE CAN MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER. THAT THERE WILL BE LESS CLIMB AIRS FASTER OPERATIONS. PROVISION OF BENEFITS OR CLIENTS. AND ENSURING THAT REALLY VOTE THAT THE CLIENTS GET WHAT THIS BODY. HAS CREATED FOR THEM AND THAT THEY GET IT IN A TIMELY FASHION. WITHOUT AIR SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS WE ARE REQUESTING A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD. ESTABLISH SUCH A STATE WORKER PROCESS DURING AUDIT THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE MIGRATION. THANK YOU MISTER HELD. NEXT WE HAVE ANDREW SHANE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VIRGINIA CHAIN. HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE LIGHTS OF TRANSFORM CALL FRESH I'M A GROUP OF THE FOOD POLICY ADVOCATES I THINK MY COVERED MOST OF IT BUT JUST COME TO PUT POINTS OF WHY WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS ACTIVITY PROCESS. TO THE POINT OF OF OF ADDING VALUE. YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S OUR OUR VIEW AND THINK IT'S BEEN BORNE OUT ANOTHER. PROJECTS INCLUDING THE DOUBLING OF OF EBT THAT I'M A SPOKEN TO PREVIOUSLY THAT BY HAVING ADVOCATES EVEN CLIENTS THEMSELVES OF YOUR ENDEAVOR TO THE FUNDRAISER ON OUR OWN AND ACTUALLY BRING THAT ON THE GROUND PERSPECTIVE. ON THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY OR WE MIGHT NOT HAVE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN IN EVERY AREA THAT HAVING THAT PERSPECTIVE INFORMS THE PROCESS. AND AND THAT NOT JUST AT THE AT THAT AT THE END IN TERMS OF USE USER TESTING AND THAT REALLY TO START THAT SOON AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE BUT STILL A PLANNING PROCESS RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S OVER COMING FORWARD NOW TO HAVE THINGS IN. IN IN PREPARATION FOR FOR WHEN ACTIVITIES MOVE FROM PLANNING TO TO EXECUTION. AND SECONDLY I THINK OUR PERSPECTIVE ON IS THAT THE POLICY SHOULD DRIVE THE TECHNOLOGY. AND SO WERE WERE HOPING THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AS MIKE SAID NOT JUST TO BE MANY GETTING ERRORS ON BUT TO BE REALLY LIFTING IT UP AS A MOMENT TO ACHIEVE. EXCELLENCE AND AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE PROCESS AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO BOTH THE STATE AND THE COUNTIES IN A MISTER MAC IS HERE AS WELL WE'VE ALREADY HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETINGS THEM AND TURN OF TOUCH IT WITH THIS GUY LOOK LIKE. THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO. CAPITAL AND YEAH I'M. FIRST COLLEGES I SAY THAT WE WE WE AGREE WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER STAKEHOLDER INVOLVEMENT IN IN THE COUNCILS. PLANNING PROCESS I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW POINTS ABOUT THAT ON. ONE POINT TO MAKE IS UNLIKE. AB TWELVE NINETY SIX AND CAL HERE'S THAT WAS A START FROM SCRATCH PROCESS WHAT WERE UNDERTAKING HERE IS ESSENTIALLY LOOKING AT THREE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE NOW AND THE FUNCTIONALITY WITHIN THOSE THREE SYSTEMS AND COMBINING THEM INTO ONE UNIFIED COUNCIL SYSTEM SO. IN A LOT OF WAYS THE REQUIREMENTS AND FUNCTIONALITY. IT IS ALREADY IS ALREADY THERE WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT THINKING IN THE SO IN TERMS OF NEW FUNCTIONALITY IN TERMS OF UTILIZING THE FUNCTIONALITY HAVE. THAT SAID ON. HERE HERE'S WHAT HERE'S WHAT WE WOULD PROPOSE AYE IT IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED ARM FIRST. WE BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE ARMED WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE A MAJOR LEVEL SAT ON THIS A MAJOR LEVEL SET MEETING PROBABLY THIS SUMMER. MIGHT BE TWO MEETINGS MIGHT EVEN INCLUDE A DEMO OF THE EXISTING LR A SYSTEM WHICH IS WHAT SORRY LEADER REPLACEMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS THE SYSTEM THAT THE FEDS ARE SENSUALLY THANK. TRIED TO USE THAT AS BEST YOU CAN AS YOU GO FORWARD INTO THE SINGLE SAUCE. WE WOULD TRY TO DO THAT THIS SUMMER FOLLOWING THAT WE BELIEVE THERE'S A NEED FOR PERIODIC BONTA CONTINUED MEETINGS WAS STAKEHOLDERS ARE ABOUT THAT ABOUT. THE PROCESS AND WHERE WE ARE IN IT AND THOSE WOULD GO ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS ARE THAT THE PACE OF THOSE MEETINGS IN THE FREQUENCY WOULD DEPEND ON KIND OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE PROJECT. AND THEN THIRD I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A FORMAL ROLE FOR ADVOCATES AND FOR CLIENTS IN THE USER AREN'T YOU KNOW CLIENT FACING PIECES OF THE SAW SYSTEM NOT ALL OF IT IS QUITE FACING BUT SOME THAT ARE. ARMED AND WE WOULD WANT DEFINITELY WANT CLIENT IN PUT THAT IN THAT NEEDS TO BE A FORMALIZED ROLE. IT NEEDS TO BE SUBJECT TO THE THE THE CONDITION AND SORT OF WORK AROUND THE ISSUE OF WE ARE IN A IN A PROCUREMENT ENVIRONMENT AND SOME THINGS NEED TO BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE HOW SUCCESSFUL STAKEHOLDER INPUT IN THE PAST AND WE WELL.

BUT BY LOOKING AT THE CONCLUSION WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT COMES WHAT WHAT THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT THEY TOOK AND TOOK YOU HURT THAT THEY LOOKED OUT BEFORE THEY CAME UP WITH THE CONCLUSION. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY LOOKING AT THE CONCLUSION.

GRIFFIN WEDDINGS JOHN ROWLAND NAM A SPECIAL CONSULTANT FOR THE OFFICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT AND I'M WITH. AND I'M CRISTINA ALAN AND I AM AN ASSISTANT CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE OFFICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S PART. SO HERE TO TALK ABOUT OUR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL YEAH IT'S THERE'S TWO PARTS TO A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. BUT WE ARE LOOKING TO RECLASSIFY SOME POSITIONS INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS TO A SPECIAL AGENT. AND CHRISTINE IS GONNA TALK ABOUT IN THE TOURNEY FOR POSITION THAT WE ARE SUCCEEDING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING WITH RECRUITMENT RETENTION PROBLEM. WITH OUR INVESTIGATORS BECAUSE OF THEIR CLASSIFICATION. WE'RE REQUESTING TO RECLASSIFY SEVEN INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS TO SPECIAL AGENT. AND TO SUPERVISE INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS TO SENIOR SPECIAL AGENT. RIGHT NOW A OF THE NINE POSITIONS WERE REQUESTING SEVEN OF THOSE NINE OR FILL BY RETIRED ANNUITANTS. WHICH IS A IT'S PROBLEMATIC FROM THE PERSPECTIVE. THAT THERE'S LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF HOURS THEY CAN WORK. WE ONLY HAVE TWO FULL TIME INVESTIGATORS AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND PITCHERS INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THE RETIREMENT NOTICE THAT WE'RE. THAT WERE UTILIZING ARE ALL FORMER SPECIAL AGENTS WHICH IS THE POSITION THAT WE'RE SEEKING SO WE CANNOT KNOW WHAT WE'RE GETTING IN REGARDS TO THEIR THEIR QUALIFICATIONS. FOR PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IT'S A WORD A CATCH TWENTY TWO SITUATION. BECAUSE OF POST PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING. UP RIGHT NOW INVESTIGATORS MUST GO THROUGH A SIX MONTH ACADEMY PRIOR TO WORKING FOR ALMOST A SIX MONTH POST ACADEMY. YET POST IS DENIED A REQUEST BECOME A POST ABC BECAUSE WE DO NOT MEET THEIR QUALIFICATIONS BUT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA THEY SENT US A LETTER. IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN BASICALLY STATING THAT. YOU DO NOT DO THE FULL RANGE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES. BICU DO NOT DO GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. WE ARE ESSENTIALLY IN INTERWAR OR A HYBRID WERE UNIQUE IN THAT WE'RE WE ARE AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS UNIT ATTACHED TO AN OVERSIGHT ENTITY WERE NOT ATTACHED TO A POLICE DEPARTMENT OR SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF HIGHWAY PATROL. SO WE DON'T MEET THE POST CRITERIA SO. WERE BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A POST ACADEMY AS A CLASSIFICATION REQUIRES. BUT WE CAN DO NOTHING TO. ADVANCE OR CONTINUE THEIR POST CERTIFICATION THERE'S TRAINING THAT GUY COMES ALONG WITH THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT BECAUSE POST IS NOT CERTIFIED US. AS OPPOSED AGENCY. ARE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS HAS CREATED A RECRUITMENT RETENTION ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE THAT POST CERTIFICATION IS CRITICAL TO PEACE OFFICERS. BECAUSE IF THEY LOSE IT THEY CAN'T GO WORK FOR ANOTHER AGENCY. SO WE'VE HAD A VERY TOUGH TIME. FILLING THESE POSITIONS. WE HAVE AS ICE IS I MENTIONED WERE RELYING ON RETIRED ANNUITANTS. ONCE WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM POST. WITH THE DENIAL WE RECOGNIZE WE HAD A PROBLEM YOU KNOW FOR ITS FORESTS AS SUSTAINABILITY. CARTON. SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE LOOKED AT DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS AND AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF SPECIAL AGENT REALLY SUITED THE TYPES OF TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DO WE ARE YOU DEAK IN THAT WE ONLY CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS. UP PEACE OFFICERS FOR SERIOUS MISCONDUCT FOR DEPARTMENTS TO HOSPITALS AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES. SO THERE'S A UNIQUE SKILL SET THAT COMES WITH THAT. YOU NEED TO HAVE WHAT YOU NEED TO HAVE BEEN A SUPERVISOR YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS. YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PEACE OFFICERS BILL WRITES THE INVESTIGATOR CLASSIFICATION THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. IS MORE OF A GENERAL CLASSIFICATION THAT USE ACROSS STATE SERVICES IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE DO IT'S NOT THAT THEY CAN'T DO THAT INVESTIGATION BUT WHAT WE FOUND EVEN. IN THE POSITIONS WE FILLED IT'S ABOUT A TWO YEAR PROCESS TO COME UP TO SPEED. THE PROBLEM IS IN THE MEANTIME WE HAVE TO WE HAVE A CASELOAD. IF THESE INVESTIGATIONS SO THAT WE'RE DOING I THINK WE'VE DONE A HUNDRED PEOPLE ALWAYS HAS BEEN EXISTENCE FOR TWO YEARS. WE'VE DONE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX INVESTIGATIONS DURING THAT TIME. SO IT'S IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CASE LOAD IN. AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT THE SPECIAL AGENT IS A BETTER CLASSIFICATION FOR THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DO. AND THEN. LASTLY. WE HAVE ANY ISSUE THAT THERE'S A. THERE'S A CONFLICT THAT'S CREATED WE HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. OF ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR OR HOSPITAL POLICE OFFICER THAT'S REPRESENTED BY THE SAME BARGAINING UNIT. SO IT CREATES A CONFLICT IT'S NOT THAT IT CAN'T HAPPEN OR IT DOESN'T HAPPEN STATE SERVICE. THE FACT REMAINS THAT IT'S NOT A BEST PRACTICE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHP OR YOU LOOK IT DEPARTMENT ATTRACTIONS THEY ALWAYS HAVE EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES. CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO HELP AVOID THAT CONFLICT AND WE HAVE DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS WHERE WE'VE HAD CONFLICTS. I DON'T SEE US. ELLIOT'S BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS AND THAT AND THEY HAVE STATED HAY ACROSS. YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS ACROSS. STATE DEPARTMENTS. IN TERMS OF OUR. THIS CONFLICT BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. IT DOESN'T MAKE IT A BEST PRACTICE AND THAT'S THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT WERE FOCUSED ON BEST PRACTICES. FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SO CERTAINLY. WE HAVE TO HOLD DEPARTMENTS TO A HIGHER STANDARD WE HAVE TO BE AT A HIGHER STANDARD THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEKING. THE RE CLASSIFICATION OF THIS POSITION. REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO SUSTAINABILITY I THINK WE'VE REALLY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEPARTMENTS. UP TO THIS POINT TIME WE'RE UNCOVERING THINGS THAT MAY HAVE NOT BEEN UNCOVERED IN THE PAST FOR MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS THE DEPARTMENTS ARE MAKING IMPROVEMENTS SO. OUR ROLE IS IMPORTANT. BUT TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE UTILIZING RETIRED ANNUITANTS IS NOT A LONG TERM FIX FOR OUR PROBLEMS. SO WE JUST REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT PART OF OUR OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL AND THEN HAVE CHRISTINE TALK ABOUT OUR. ATTORNEY FOR POSITION. OKAY YES SO THE SECOND PART OF OUR AND THE CP REQUEST IS FOR AN ATTORNEY FOR OUR CENTRAL REGION. AND THE REASONS FOR REQUEST FOR TWO FULL THE THE FIRST THE MAIN ONE IS BECAUSE I AM ARE CENTRAL. ESSENTIAL ATTORNEY CURRENTLY IT AN ATTORNEY THREE. ASSEMBLY HAS AN UNMANAGEABLE CASELOAD SHE HAS THE LARGEST DEVELOPMENT CENTERS WELL AS TUESDAY HOSPITALS. HAVE VERSES ARE NORTH AND SOUTH ATTORNEYS TO EACH CARRIED OUT MOST ON WEDNESDAY HOSPITAL. AND IN ADDITION JUST THE SHEER NUMBERS OF THE CASES SHE CARRIES NOT TOTALLY OVER DOUBLE THE CASELOAD. AND ON TOP OF THE CASELOAD NUMBERS THAT SHE ALSO THE GEOGRAPHICALLY THE FACILITIES ARE ALL EXTREMELY FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER. COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS OF SHE SPENDS A GREAT DEAL TIME TRAVELING ON THE ROAD. I SOARED TEMPORARY FIX AND FOR NOW IT'S BEEN SORT OF LIKE OUR PROBLEM THAT JAMAS EXPLAINING THIS WEEK. I'M HIRED IN ARE A INVESTIGATOR. AND SO HE'S ABLE TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE INTERVIEWS AND YOU KNOW ATTENDING SOME OF THOSE BUT HE'S NOT ABLE TO HELP WITH THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF IT. IN HOPING THAT HER THIRTIES MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON A PLATE DISCIPLINE AND. YOU KNOW MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS AND. MONITORING THE. APPELLATE PROCESS THAT GOES ON AND THE DECISION DDS ATTORNEYS. SO AND WE NEED WE NEED SOMEBODY IN CENTRAL TO UP HELP CARRY PART OF THAT CASE LOAD. AND THE REASON OR REQUESTING A FOUR IS BECAUSE OFTENTIMES ARE ATTORNEYS ARE MONITORING AND. REPORTING ON ATTORNEY FORCE FOR DTS HD DTS. AND SO IT IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE HAVE A THREE. YOU KNOW MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO FOR WHOM HE HAS MORE EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S BETTER TO HAVE A FOR MONITORING FOR. SO AND. THOSE THE TWO PRIMARY REQUEST WE ALSO LOST TO I'M ALLERGIC CONTRACT ATTORNEYS UP LAST YEAR SO THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO HELP BEFORE WERE IN OBVIOUSLY WORKING MORE DOWN SOME. MANPOWER THERE. SO VOTER QUESTION ATTORNEY FOR FOR THOSE REASONS THANK YOU. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ELLIOTT. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIVE AT THIS TIME. TO ME ISSUE SIX. MISTER CHAIRMAN MACHINE LEVINE ON BEHALF OF CS ONLY A WHICH IS BARGAINING UNIT SEVEN. WE WOULD BE LOSING NINE POSITIONS AS A RESULT THIS REQUEST VACATION WE ARE OPPOSED TO IT. WE WOULD PUT ON THE RECORD THAT. OF IT WAS UNTIL ABOUT A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THAT WE FIRST FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS ON THE WERE NO CONVERSATIONS WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO CHIEF POST AGENCY STATUS. A WERE UNAWARE. THAT THERE WERE ISSUES AROUND GETTING POSE CERTIFICATION. THAT ALSO LOOKS ARTIST WIENER. ALSO STIPULATE THAT THE. AS FAR AS A CONFLICT IS CONCERNED IT'S NOT UNIQUE OR SOMEHOW A PECULIAR A RARE THAT AN AGENCY. HAS AYE A BUILT INTO IT INVESTIGATES ITSELF WOULD BE UNIQUE HERE. AND WE ALSO SUGGEST THAT TERM IS WRONG HAD. BUT EARLIER THAT HE HAD BEEN PURSUING OPPOSE CERTIFICATION FOR THIS AGENCY FOR SOMETIME. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. IT CAPS AWAITING THE AGENCY SO THAT WOULD HAVE HAD ALSO HAD AYE BUILT INTO IT AS WELL SO THERE IS AN INHERENT CONFLICT WHY WOULD YOU ALSO MEANS BC COMPOSER VACATION AT SAME TIME. SO. IT'S A LITTLE CONSISTENT TO SAY THERE IS A CONFLICT BUILT IN SO WE'RE HAPPY KEEP WORKING WITH THEM. TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY TO TRAIN BETTER OR TO PURSUE POST CERTIFICATION WITH THEM BUT AT THIS POINT WHERE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER TEAMED UP WITH. HOW JUST FOR CLARIFICATION CHAIN HOW HOW IS IT THAT YOU CAN AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT HOW YOU WOULD LOSE NINE POSITIONS IF? IF WE FOUNDED THIS. SO THE SPECIAL BUT THE CLASSIFICATION THAT THEY WOULD BE CHANGING THIS TO THE ONLY FOLKS THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE ELIGIBLE TO TO FILL THOSE POSITIONS. ARE FROM CDC ARE ULTIMATELY THEY MAINTAIN THAT CLASSIFICATION CURRENTLY OUR FOLKS WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE OF FOR THOSE POSITIONS. DOES THE DEPARTMENT HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. WELL IT DOES HE IN REGARDS THE LAST STATEMENT CDC. IF YOU MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS YOU CAN COME FROM A POLICE DEPARTMENT AS LONG AS YOU MEET QUALIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL AGENT YOU CAN. IT'S NOT SOLELY FROM DEPARTMENT CORRECTIONS. A. RJR TO KERN INVESTIGATORS YET WILL ALTHOUGH THEY'RE NOT SPECIAL AGENTS ARE TO KERN INVESTIGATORS ARE FROM FROM POLICE DEPARTMENTS. IN REGARDS TO NOTIFICATION AS WE WENT TO THE BCP PROCESS. BUT WE DID SEE EACH OTHER. POSE CERTIFICATION FOR ABOUT A TWO YEAR PERIOD MEETING WITH POST OFTEN ON AND AND WHEN WE RECEIVE THE NOTIFICATION FROM POST WE KNEW WE HAD A PROBLEM WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM POST. AT THAT POINT IN TIME. SI A SILLY A BECAME AWARE OF THE VCP WE MET WITH CS LA A I'VE COMMUNICATED WITH THEM SEVERAL TIMES BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO US AT A MEETING WE HAVE BEEN OFFICE AT THAT MEETING. TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE ISSUE. I STILL THINK WHEN YOU READ THE POST REGULATION IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT POSTS IS ASKING. I'M SO I I STILL THINK IT'S GONNA BE IT WOULD BE AN UP HILL BATTLE. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT WITHIN SEE ASSEMBLY A WERE REALLY CABBAGES FOCUS ON OUR MISSION. IN WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW BEST FULFILL OUR MISSION. IF CO CILIATES WILLING TO MEET WITH US WITH POSTS WERE CERTAIN WILLING TO DO IT BUT I JUST DON'T SEE POSTS CHANGING THAT REGULATION WHEN YOU READ THE POST REGULATION ONE THOUSAND ONE. IT'S VERY CLEAR. IN TERMS OF. WHAT THE CRITERIA IS TO BE A POST TO BE A POST AGENCY ITSELF? THAT'S OUR RESPONSE TO IT BUT CERTAINLY WILLING TO WORK WITH CS ALLEVIATE BUT. I I SEE IS AN UPHILL BATTLE IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE WE'RE SURVIVING A RETIRED ANNUITANTS. WE HAVE A CASELOAD AND THE PROBLEM CONTINUES I'D LIKE TO ASK OIL WELL YES IF YOU CAN. TO PLEASE ASSIST US IN LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE VIEWPOINT OF THIS REQUEST AND TO ORGANIZE A MEETING WITH THE RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS THE ALEJO AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO DISCUSS THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT ARE BROUGHT FORWARD WITH THIS BCP. I'D LIKE TO ASK IF POSSIBLE FOR THIS MEETING TO BE CONVENED AS SOON AS PRACTICAL GOAL. FOR US TO INFORMER MAY REVISION ACTION ON THIS ISSUE RIGHT ABSOLUTELY AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN AND THANK ON. WE ARE. WE HAVE OUR FRESHEST MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHO'S HERE AND SEEING HER I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR. THANK YOU I THINK HERE VOTER SUPPRESSION SO CLEAN WELCOME. WELL THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON THAT CHAFEE BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO CURRENTLY THE CALIFORNIA CHAFEE GRANT PROGRAM ASSIST SAP PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO FOSTER YOUTH FOR EDUCATIONAL OR CAREER TRAINING. YOUTH BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. HOWEVER THIS AGE CUT OFF CAN BE UNREALISTIC FOR MANY FOSTER YOUTH. IN FACT I OFTENTIMES FORMER% FOSTER YOUTH DO NOT EVEN HEAR ABOUT THE CHAFEE GRANT PROGRAM UNTIL AFTER THEY HAVE AGED OUT OF ELIGIBILITY. THIS PROPOSAL WILL DO TWO THINGS. IT EXTENDS THE AGE LIMIT TO TWENTY SIX AND IT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE FUNDING TO SUPPORT ADDITIONAL YOUTH IN THE PROGRAM. AS A FORMER COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEE I CAN SPEAK TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST AND THE OPPORTUNITY IT WILL PROVIDE. OVER FIFTY TWO PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS WHO ATTEND THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE. LESS THAN FIVE PERCENT OF THE FORMER FOSTER TEUTONS FOUGHT FORMER FOSTER TO STUDENTS WHO ATTEND. GRADUATES AND THOSE THAT DO SPEND AN AVERAGE OF SIX YEARS IN COLLEGE TRYING TO DO SO. AND A FOSTER YOUTH TOWN HALL I CONVENE SOME YEARS AGO MANY YOUTH TALKED ABOUT THE THREE LEGGED STOOL THAT INCLUDES EDUCATION HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT. THE MOST IMPORTANT LEG FOR THEM WAS EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE AT STABILIZED EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF THEIR LIFE LIKE BEING ABLE TO TRAVEL. TO SCHOOL TO EAT TO PAY RENT TO BUY BOOKS ACCEPT IRA. BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THE DEATHS ADDITIONAL CHAFEE FUNDING WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THIS TOOL ENCOURAGE FOSTER STUDENTS TO STAY ENGAGED IN THEIR EDUCATION. AND LET THEM KNOW THAT WE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO INVEST IN THEIR SUCCESS. HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME ARE CRYSTAL HARRIS A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND GRADUATE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW. AND JESSE AGUILAR THE DIRECTOR OF BEYOND FOSTER CARE AT JOURNEY HOUSE AND ALSO LEAD ORGANIZER ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS PROPOSAL. GOOD AFTERNOON A WITH A WAS MENTIONED MY NAME IS JUSTIN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF JENNY HOUSE. OF FOR THE PAST THIRTY FIVE YEARS. JENNY HOUSE HAS ASSISTED FOSS YOU CAN IN ROLLING AND COMPETE IN THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION JENNY'S. WE'VE FIVE SEEN FIRST HAND ARE I'D HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH STUDENTS IN THE FOSTER CARE. IDG TEAM AND THEN RETURN AGE TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE. AND IN SOME CASES FOLKS WERE RETURNING A CLOSER TO THEIR THIRTIES AND ARE JUST FEELING READY TO EITHER START OR RETURN TO SCHOOL. PART OF OUR INTAKE PROCESS ISN'T IT ARE AND AN ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS TO DETERMINE. IF ANY OF THE ERA OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR PROGRAM AND RECEIVED A HELP FOR MANY PROGRAMMERS ARE AGENCY. TOO OFTEN THAT WE CONCLUDE THAT OUR FOLKS DID NOT ACCESS ANY OF THE SERVICES. OR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR SUCH AS THE INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM EXTENDED FAR SECURE TV GRANT. ARE AND THERE'S A LIST OF REASONS WHY FOSTER YOUTH DO NOT TAXES THESE CRUCIAL SUPPORT. BUT WE KNOW THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF HOUSE YOU'D BECOME HOMELESS WITH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF LIVING CARE. WE KNOW THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD TO FOSTER CARE. YOUNG WOMEN WHO EXIT FOSTER CARE BECOME PREGNANT WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. A LIVING CARE. AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT YOU GO INTO SURVIVAL MODE WHEN THEY LEAVE OUR CARE BECAUSE THEY ARE LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES. THIS MEANS THAT INCOME IS A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN WORKING TOWARDS A LONG TERM GOAL. IT MEANS THAT PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR CHILD. IS A BIGGER PRIORITY THEM PASSING THE TEST. AND THIS OFTEN LEADS TO HAVING TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL TO WORK AND PROVIDE. OTHERS NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. MANY EXPRESS THEIR VERY SIMPLY THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING GOVERNED BY AN INSTITUTION. SO WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN EMANCIPATE THE CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND THEMSELVES FORBIDDING THEM VALUABLE SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR. WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW. ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BRAIN SCIENCE RESEARCH WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T DEVELOP CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION MAKING ABILITY. AND TALK UNTIL IT LEAVES THE TWENTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY. THIS IS CRUCIAL IS HIGHER EDUCATION REQUIRES DISCIPLINE THAT MANY FOSTER YOU. FORTUNATELY. AND NEVER DEVELOP LOVING CARE. THEY HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE THE HARD WAY. ARE THESE INVESTMENTS IN TV PROGRAM IS ABOUT GIVING ALL THE FUSS YOU THE CHANCE. TO LIVE SELF SUSTAINING LIVES. IT'S ABOUT GIVING THOSE WHO HAD NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN THEIR EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY AND OPPORTUNITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. WE KNOW THAT THESE INVESTMENTS GOING A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. AS THESE PROGRAMS ABOUT ARE UNIQUE IN THAT THEY ALLOW STUDENTS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL RELATED EXPENSES. BEYOND TUITION AND FEES. BOOKS FOOD CHILDCARE RENT. SCHOOL SUPPLIES IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WERE URGING SUPPORT ON THIS CRUCIAL INVESTMENT. MISTER AGUILAR. HELLO MY NAME IS CRYSTAL. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I WENT TO. COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE A TEACHER UNDERSTOOD BEANO TOLD ME TO START COLLEGE. HE ASKED ME WHAT WOULD I BE DOING AT THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE AND AT EIGHTEEN I HAD NO PLAN. SO THEREFORE I DECIDED TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. THAT TIME I WAS VERY CRITICAL IN MY ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID. SHOULD I HAVE WAITED TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE CHAFEE GRANT. FOR ME. STARTING EDUCATION AT THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. CHAFEE MET MONEY FOR HOUSING FOR CLOTHING TRANSPORTATION. SECURITY AND MORE THAN ANYTHING FOR PEACE OF MIND. NOW ONE COULD SAY WHY NOT JUST GET WORK STUDY WELL WORK STUDY IS CAPPED AT TWENTY HOURS ENDED DOESN'T OFTEN COVER THE RISING COSTS OF RENT AND FOOD. AFTER THREE YEARS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE ADVENTUROUS FOR TO UCLA. AND WHEN I WAS AT UCLA THE FINANCIAL BURDEN BECAME SO HARD THAT ALL I COULD REALLY DO WAS WORK AT SCHOOL AND GO TO CLASSES. I COULD NOT FULLY EXPERIENCE IN BE I COULD NOT BE A VIABLE PART OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE WHICH MEANT I COULD NOT AFFORD TO JOIN A SORORITY. I COULD NOT AFFORD TO DO FREE WORK IN AN INTERNSHIP I COULD NOT AFFORD TO STUDY ABROAD. ALL I COULD DO WAS WORK AND GO TO CLASS. THIS WAS EXPRESSED IN AN INTERESTING WAY THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE CHAFEE GRANT. IN MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR OF LIFE IS WHEN I WAS GIVEN THE AMAZING OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THE NOW ATTORNEY GENERAL IN DC. BUT I WAS TWENTY THREE. AND THAT PROGRAM WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO WORK WORK STUDY. SO IN BC I HAD NO EXTRA FINANCIAL AID I WAS UNABLE TO WORK WORK STUDY SO I HAD NO MONEY TO PAY. FOR HOUSING OR FOOD. AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE CHAFEE GRANT WHICH I WAS USED TO GETTING FROM THE AGES FROM EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO. BUT IT WAS CAPPED. AND IN THAT VERY SEMESTER I ACCRUE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DEBT. THAT TOOK ME THREE THREE YEARS TO PAY OFF I ACTUALLY DIDN'T PAY IT OFF UNTIL. MY SECOND YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL. AND BECAUSE OF THAT DEBT. BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF ACCESS TO THE CHAFEE GRANT BECAUSE OF MY AGE. IT TOOK AWAY SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO FULLY ENJOY. MY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN MY EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. FOR ME THE CHAFEE MEANS THE ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MONEY WITHOUT MAKING EDUCATIONAL SACRIFICES. AND FOR THESE REASONS. I BELIEVE THAT YOU ALL SHOULD PASS THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISS HARRIS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM VALERIE EARLY ENOUGH WE CAN MAKE A SPOT FOR HER. TO BE APPRECIATED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COMMITTING I'M VALERIE EARLY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE NO FORMAL POSITION ON THE BILL CLEARLY IT'S AN IMPORTANT ASPECT IN WE WERE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ALL IF THIS IS A. PRIORITY FOR THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU MA'AM. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE A MORE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OUT WE'RE ONLY JUST LEARNING ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO MEET WITH ADVOCATES AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL SYSTEMS AS NECESSARY.

THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING HAS HAD AN INTERAGENCY AGREEMENT WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN TO DELIVER ARM SNAPPED ED. A. PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AND EDUCATION. THROUGH OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING AND THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS T EXPAND BOTH OUR STATE OPERATIONS FUNDING AS WELL AS THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING. SNAP IT INTERVENTIONS MUST BE EVIDENCE BASED NUTRITION EDUCATION AND OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAMS. AND SO USING THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING HAS BEEN A GOOD NEXUS ON BOTH FOR SOCIAL SERVICES AND AS AND THAT THE AREA AGENCIES ALREADY ARE PROVIDING NUTRITION SERVICES. ARM AND ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT TARGETED TO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES WHICH IS THE NEXUS WITH WITH SNAP ED. AND WE ALSO PROVIDE. EVIDENCE BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS THROUGH OUR TITLE THREE D. PROGRAMS WELL SO THE NEXUS IS DEFINITELY THERE. HOWEVER ON BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE TO DATE IN TERMS OF BEING INVOLVED WITH SNAP ED. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS WE CERTAINLY REALIZE THAT THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING NEED MORE GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ARM AND MONITORING FOR THE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF THE SERVICES THIRTY NOT UNCOMPLICATED. ARM PROGRAMS TO DELIVER AND DECIDING WHICH EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE AND ATTRACT AN AUDIENCE ARM. EXCEPT TESTING AND AND LEARNING. AS THEY GO. EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT THE PARTICIPATING. SO THAT IS AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF AS AN TERM AND OUR OUR STAFFING LEVELS. ON EQUALLY IMPORTANT WE REALIZE THAT THE AREA AGENCIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING AT THIS POINT. THAT WORK INVOLVED IN DELIVERING THESE PROGRAMS. IS NOT SUFFICIENT WITH THE FUNDING THAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY RECEIVING AT LEAST A NUMBER OF THEM IN TERMS OF THE BASELINE FUNDING THAT GET TO OPERATE. AND MEET ALL OF THESE REQUIREMENTS SO THIS SNAP IT. PROPOSAL OF BEFORE YOU WOULD INCREASE CTA'S. OPERATING STATE BUDGET FOR THIS PROGRAM TO A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND ONGOING. WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO INCREASE OUR ON HEALTH PROGRAM SPECIALIST POSITION TO A FULL TIME. LEVEL RIGHT NOW IT'S I THINK THREE THREE POINT POINT THREE FIVE. AND THEN MAKE THE TO LIMITED TERM POSITIONS A A ALICE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS PROGRAM PERMANENT SO THAT. YOU KNOW THAT EXPERTISE STAYS WITH US LONG TERM I'M MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL I'M A STATE OPERATIONS RESOURCES IN TERMS OF OUR INCORRECT ON COSTS AND SOME SPECIAL STUDIES THAT WE FILLER ARE IMPORTANT TO DO. WITH THESE. UP WITH THIS KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE INCREASE AT THE STATE LEVEL ON IN PLACE. BOTH SOCIAL SERVICES NCTA BELIEVES THAT WILL THEN HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO REALLY BE ABLE TO AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE. SIXTEEN PARTICIPATING AREA AGENCIES ON AGING TO HELP THEM. KIND OF INCREASE THEIR TARGETING THE SELECTION OF PROGRAMS THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY MOST LIKELY BENEFICIAL IN THEIR COMMUNITY. AND HELP THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF MEETING THAT THE PROGRAM UP PERFORMANCE GOALS. SO THIS. BUT EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT. ARE FROM THE LOCAL ASSIST INSIDE THE PROPOSAL INCLUSIVE INCLUDES ANOTHER ONE POINT THREE MILLION AND LOCAL ASSISTANCE. EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY FOR ITEMS EIGHTEEN AFFECTS QUICKER EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND ONGOING SO THAT THOSE SIXTEEN PARTICIPATING AREA AGENCIES ALL RECEIVE AT LEAST A BASELINE OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO OPERATE THIS PROGRAM RIGHT NOW. ABOUT HALF OF THE AREA AGENCIES ARE RECEIVING LESS THAN THAT AND THEY REALLY DO NEED TO HAVE. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF BASE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO TO OPERATE THESE PROGRAMS. AND EFFECTIVELY THERE'S NO STATE MATCH. FOR THIS GRANT AND THE FUNDING IS A HUNDRED PERCENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO MAY I JUST ASK IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. PUBLISHED WAS RIGHT APARTMENT FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE REQUEST THE REASON STATED BY THE PARLIAMENT AND I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE AUGMENTATION WILL RESULT IN A BASE FUNDING EIGHTY THOUSAND PER PARTICIPATING TRIPLE ACT. OKAY. EARLIER CHECK TO BRAZIL LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE'VE CONDUCTED INITIAL REVIEW THE SPRING FINANCE LETTER REYES NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME BECAME. ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ONE FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGING. SEEING NONE. THIS ISSUE WAS WELL RECEIVED AND WE WILL HOLD THIS OPEN. THANK YOU WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE ONE FOR THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE. SO LOSE PUSH ROD APARTMENT FINANCE WILL BE PRESENTING THIS REQUEST. THE COMPANIES WHO HAVE IT LEGISLATURE REQUIRES THE REAPPROPRIATION OF THE UNENCUMBERED BALANCE OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION. SO FOR SOME CONTEXT THIS YEAR LEGISLATURE RECEIVE A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OF. TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AS TEMPORARY FUNDING WHILE THE ORGANIZATION I FIGURED OUT LONG TERM FINANCING PLAN. THEY ALSO HAVE A TWENTY SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND OF UNSPENT FUNDS FROM THERE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN APPROPRIATIONS. FOR A TOTAL OF SIX HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND SPEND IN CURRENT YEAR. PLUS YOURSELVES PROJECTING EXPENDITURES OF ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND. WHICH WOULD LEAVE A BALANCE OF ABOUT THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND THIS IS WHAT WE ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW WE NEED TO BE A RE APPROPRIATED THROUGH THIS REQUEST SOME HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DOCTOR CONNELLY I HAVE YOU NEXT ON OURS BUT TOM I MAY PASSED THE QUESTIONS AFTERWARDS IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU OKAY. I'M WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS LIKE I THINK THE THE INITIAL COMMENT THAT I MADE IT THERE ARE PRIVATE BY PRIOR BUDGET HEARING. IN TERMS OF THAT. DEFERRED THE DIFFERENTIATING WHAT THE VALUE IS. IN TERMS OF CSL COMING TO DEPARTMENT OF AGING VERSUS SAYING IT DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES WE WOULD STILL NEED TO. CHARGE FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. THAT WE WILL BE OFFERING AT THE DEPARTMENT. AND THEN THERE'S THE SO. HOW WAS THERE A SAVINGS THERE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW OPERATIONAL? FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK YOU KNOW STILL ON THINKING ABOUT THIS AND REFLECTING WITH OTHERS ABOUT THIS AS WELL. THAT. KIND OF THAT. THE MORPHING ADS TO HOUSE CSL REMAINS INDEPENDENT WITHIN A DEPARTMENT THAT HAS A VERY UNSPECIFIC CONSTRICTS STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF HOW WE. INTERACT WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF LEGISLATION AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. IT BECOMES MURKY AND CHALLENGING. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE IS TO IDENTIFY AND AS JOHN POINTER VIEW NO MENTION LAST TIME SHOP. LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS TO THE TO LEGISLATORS DIRECTLY AND HAVE THAT ONGOING INTERACTION WITH THEM SO. THAT THAT REMAINS OUR PERSPECTIVE. I LIVE. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE ONE. JANICE BAILEY WITH A CALIFORNIA SENIOR LEGISLATURE ON THE STAFF SERVICES MANAGER. AND WE DO CONTINUE TO SEEK PLACEMENT OF THE CS ALL OFFICE WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION TO REDUCE COSTS AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY FOR THE ORGANIZATION. AND WE ALSO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BCP BEFORE YOU TODAY. THANK YOU. I'M. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I WANTED TO ASK IF I COULD IF THERE WAS. I DO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENTATION DUE TO THEIR ADVOCACY. BUT I DO WONDER IF THERE IS A FIRE WALL THAT MAY BE PUT IN PLACE TO HELP. PROVIDE THEM THE ADMINISTRATIVE HELP THEY NEED WITH. AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE SEPARATING THEIR ADVOCACY FROM THE WORK THAT YOU DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT. SO I THINK I WOULD JUST TAKE THIS BACK AND THEN I'LL DEFER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BUT THE GOAL WAS FROM CFLS PERSPECTIVE FIND A LOCATION THAT WOULD BE LESS COSTLY TO THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT. FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO BE DOING THAT FOR A LESSER COST. MEANS THAT WERE ACTUALLY USING OUR OTHER FUNDING RESOURCES. TO IN EFFECT AUGMENT THE NEEDS. OF THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE. AND. WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO TO DO THAT TYPE OF AUGMENTATION. SOME WOMEN RUBIO AYE. I AM NEW HERE BUT. I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE PRAGMATIC OR THE PRACTICAL ISSUES LIKE HOUSING NOT NECESSARILY HOW WOULD THAT TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR FUNDING IF IT WAS BASICALLY JUST AN OFFICE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO. SO I'M ENVISIONING THAT IT'S MORE OF A HOUSING ISSUE. YOU KNOW WHERE THOSE THE PERSON IS PLACED AND IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A BUILDING I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR OWN. EYE THAT I'M JUST BEING PRACTICAL HERE AND SO SO IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. I'M IN TERMS OF A FIREWALL I APPRECIATE THAT THE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE ISSUES BUT I'M THINKING HOUSING WISE. THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE AWAY BUT EXPLAIN IT. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE VIEW THE SUPER LAYMAN'S I'M APPROACHING FINANCE WILL PROBABLY GIVE YOU THE MORE TECHNICAL PROTEST THAT. UP IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF HOUSING AND ALL THOSE SPACES AND IT'S AN ISSUE AND OUR DEPARTMENT BUT IT'S. YOU KNOW THE SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY PROVIDING INCLUDE ALL OF THEIR BILLING. ANY LEGAL CONSULTATION THAT THEY NEED PERSONNEL. DEALING WITH PERSONNEL ISSUES THE FULL RANGE OF I'M SORRY BUT HOW MANY PERSONAL DO THEY HAVE. THEY HAVE THEY HAVE WON A STAFF PERSON IS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT THEY HAVE A GROUP OF VOLUNTEERS THAT THEY INTERACT WITH ON A REGULAR BASIS AND THEN. THE BOND. FED DRAWDOWN AND VARIOUS OTHER I MEAN WE DON'T ACTUALLY EVEN KNOW THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT THOSE ISSUES BUT THOSE ISSUES ARE. BUT. THEY WOULD HAVE AND NEED. ASSISTANCE ON A VARIETY OF ISSUES ARM RIGHT NOW THEY'RE BEING CHARGED BY DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. THE STANDARD RATE FOR THOSE SERVICES THAT WOULD BE WHAT. PRESUMABLY DEPARTMENT OF FIGHT OF AGING WOULD. BE REQUIRING AS WELL AND THE OTHER BY I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES FROM THEIR BCP WAS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT. ARM TO HAVE TO COVER THE STAFFING INCREASED COSTS FOR THAT POSITION THEY WANTED KIND OF THE. WAIVER FROM HAVING TO DO THAT. MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THEIR BUDGET. WE WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO NOT DO THAT AND AS A SOMEONE IS ENOUGH THAT SOMEONE. AND WE'D HAVE TO ABSORB THE COSTS IF THEY WERE. AT AT THOSE COSTS WERE WAY FOR SOME REASON. REFER TO FINANCE WE ARE MORE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE HAD CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMPANY SAN LEGISLATURE ABOUT THIS ISSUE AT STEMMING FROM OUR LAST MEETING WITH YOU ALL. I'M AND. WE LOOKED NOT ONLY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING BUT AT THAT NUMBER OF OTHER KIND OF MODELS AND ENTITIES IN THE STATE. AND THE THE ULTIMATE KIND OF CONCLUSION IS THAT PICKED CUP CONTRACTOR FISCAL SERVICES WHICH IS UNKNOWN APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IF. AND DO THIS WORK SIGNIFICANTLY THAT LAST COST AND GENERALLY CANNOT ABSORB THAT COST BY THEIR OWN WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION. I'VE CONTRACTED FISCAL SERVICES EXITS FOR EXACTLY THIS PURPOSE AND IT ALREADY HAS THAT BUILT IN FIREWALL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH THE. POLITICAL ISSUES OF WHATEVER DEPARTMENT MADE TO OR CANNOT HAVE. PUMP IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT CONVERSATION SO MAYBE I CAN OUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A MEETING WITH YOU. ALL TOUCH MY SCHEDULER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE BECAUSE I I. JUST I JUST LOGISTICALLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND DIED SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR THE CONVERSATION I'VE LIKE I SAID I'M VERY PRACTICAL AND FOR ME IT'S JUST A MATTER OF. YOU KNOW PUTTING ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THAT. SIMPLE HERE AND I WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO. ISSUE THREE SINCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACOSTA IS HERE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. I DO SHARE AND MIL SOME OF EVER COOLEY WILL BE JOINING ME MOMENTARILY HE'S. I THEY BELIEVE WALKING OVER FOR ANOTHER FROM ANOTHER COMMITTEE. SO ALL GET STARTED. THE BILL TALKS LOW. HELLO FOLKS CALIFORNIA. IF YOU WOULD MY WOULD YOU SECURE POSITION WHO'VE BEEN. BUT THAT. I AM I REALLY. GREATLY APPRECIATE IT AND MY CUTTING. A CUT IN THE LINES I GUESS I'M HERE. OKAY SO. AND WE START OFF CALIFORNIA FOSTER YOU FACE MANY CHALLENGES ON AVERAGE STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE PERFORM DISPROPORTIONATELY BOTH SOCIALLY AND ECONOMIC ECONOMICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY. IN COMPARISON TO THEIR CLASSMATES. A LESS THAN HALF GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND ONLY THREE TO FIVE PERCENT GRADUATE FROM FOUR YEAR COLLEGES. FOSTER YOUTH ARE ON AVERAGE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SUSPENSIONS EXPULSIONS AND INTERACTIONS WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHILE THERE BEEN POLICY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF FOSTER YOU. WE HAVE FAILED TO ACT ON THE GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH INDICATING THE POSITIVE IMPACT THAT EXTRA CURRICULAR ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. SUCH AS SPORTS ART AND MUSIC PLANE SHAPING A YOUNG PERSON'S ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND OVERALL WELL BEING. EXTRACURRICULAR NAME AND RETRACTED BEES HAVE PROVEN TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON A YOUNG PERSON'S ATTENDANCE MOTIVATION ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT SELF ESTEEM AND BEHAVIOR. HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS ARE FOSTERED OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM THE PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS SCHOOL SPONSORED TRIPS AFTER SCHOOL CLUBS ETCETERA. THESE BONDS CONTRIBUTE TO A FOSTER YOUTH SENSE OF BELONGING AND CONNECTION. ESPECIALLY WHEN EVIDENCE SHOWS A SEVENTY PERCENT OF FOSTER YOUTH EXPERIENCE THE INSTABILITY OF THREE OR MORE PLACEMENTS. FURTHERMORE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES ARE AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO REBEL TO BUILD A ROBUST AND WELL VERSED COLLEGE APPLICATION. THESE ACTIVITIES ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE COMPETITIVE SO THEY CAN EVENTUALLY ADVANCE INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. OVER A DECADE AGO THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED A PRUDENT PARENT STANDARD. AND THE FOSTER CARE BILL OF RIGHTS BOTH OF WHICH ESTABLISHED THE RIGHT OF A FOSTER YOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN EXTRACURRICULAR INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES. DESPITE THIS TRAILBLAZING BLAZING LEGISLATION THE FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE AVAILABLE TO GUARANTEE A STUDENT'S INVOLVEMENT IN THESE ACTIVITIES. FOSTER CARE GRANT'S OFTEN DO NOT COVER THE COST OF ART MUSIC LESSONS SPORTS ACTIVITIES TEST PREP COURSES SUMMER CAMPS ETCETERA. THESE ACTIVITIES PROVIDE A SENSE OF NORMALCY IN ADDITION TO DIVERSIFYING THE FOSTER USE RESUME FOR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS AND GENERALLY LIFE EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE PREFER A FULLY FUNDED STATEWIDE PROGRAM TO THE TUNE OF FIFTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WE ARE AMENABLE TO ITS TO INSTITUTING A LIMITED PILOT PROGRAM? AS A OUTLINED IN OUR LETTER I AM REQUESTING AT THE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES FIVE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN ORDER TO FUND THE FOST YOU THROUGH RICHARD PILOT PROGRAM FOR LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO MERCED AND IMPERIAL COUNTIES. THANK THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AND SOME MEMBER COOLEY IS JOINING ME IN. WE HAVE SOME. IF YOU LIKE THAT. YEAH OF I MAY SPEAK BRIEFLY DO IT TERRIFIC BILL AYE CHAIR OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON FOSTER YOUTH. I THINK THESE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE AN OUTSTANDING SETTING WHERE. YOUNG PEOPLE CAN. ENGAGE IN A CONSTRUCTIVE LEARNING ACTIVITY OF SOME SORT AND FORM CLOSE FRIENDSHIPS. AHA. AND. THOUGH IT THAT'S SORT OF. DESTRUCTIVE POSITIVE PURPOSEFUL. AND OF RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. PHIL PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE THEIR LIFE IT IT HA. IT JUST GIVES THEM. AN AREA IN WHICH TO ENJOY SUCCESS IN CHOI CAMARADERIE IN CHOI GROWING CLOSE TO OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO WORKING DATA. HAVE A GROWING EDGE IN THEIR LIFE CONCERN IS SOMETHING THEY LIKE AND LOVE. IT'S AN EXTREMELY POSITIVE THING. AND. SO I JUST I THINK THIS IS A TREMENDOUS EFFORT. AND I THINK WE SHOULD PROVIDE FUNDING. YOU KNOW. THE MOST PRECIOUS THING IN A CHILD'S LIFE IS TO HAVE TIME THAT THEY CAN GROW CONSTRUCTIVELY. AND THIS PROVIDES YOU TREMENDOUS SETTING WHERE WHEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOL FRIENDSHIPS GROWING EDGE. CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT WHICH IS VERY POSITIVE. AND SO I THINK YOU FOR THE INITIATIVE. AND THE. I STRONGLY SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU TO WHOEVER COOLEY NEXT WE HAVE LUCY SAUCEDO CARTER. THANK YOU. AB I'M THE POLICY ADVOCATE WITH THE YOUTH LAW CENTER. THE YOUTH LAW CENTER ADVOCATES TO TRANSFORM THE JUVENILE JUSTICE AND CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM SO THAT ALL CHILDREN CAN THRIVE. AND WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS PROPOSAL. I'M BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT WILL HELP FOSTER CHILDREN TO HAVE THE NORMAL EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING IN ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. THIS IS A NORMAL EXPERIENCE A I WANT TO EMPHASIZE NORMAL THAT IS SO VITAL FOR A HEALTHY CHILD CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND YET IT IS SO OFTEN DENIED. FOSTER YOU BECAUSE OF COST ANOTHER BARRIERS. CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL LAWS REQUIRE THAT ALL YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN AGE AND DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES. YET COST IS A KEY BARRIER. FOR EXAMPLE AND ACTIVITY COULD COST SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS LET'S SAY. AND IF YOU'VE GOT A COUPLE OF CHILDREN IN YOUR FAMILY AND THEY WANT TO ENGAGE IN MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT ADDS UP VERY QUICKLY. I'M AN EXISTING FOSTER CARE. FUNDING. THE FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS DOES NOT EXPLICITLY GO TOWARDS THESE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. SO ALTHOUGH OUR LAWS. REQUIRED PARTICIPATION. WE'RE NOT REALLY PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTHS ARE ON THIS ONE. TO QUOTE ONE FOSTER PARENT. IT'S ALMOST OFFENSIVE FOR SOMEONE TO SAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO ENROLL THEM. BUT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU YOUR WHOLE BUDGET FOR THE WHOLE YEAR. AND OTHER WORDS ARE LOS MAKE CLEAR HOW IMPORTANT ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES ARE TO NORMALCY AND WELL BEING. FOR FOSTER YOUTH BUT OUR PAYMENT STRUCTURES DO NOT SUPPORT CARE GIVERS PROVIDING THESE VITAL ACTIVITIES. AND YET WE'VE HEARD ALREADY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THESE ACTIVITIES I'M JUST GONNA GIVE A COUPLE OF. EXAMPLES GOING A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE RESEARCH AND WHAT IT SAYS. YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES BETTER GRADES AND HIGHER GRADUATION RATES. YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN RICHMOND ACTIVITIES HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE CULTIVATE SOFT SKILLS. SUCH IS THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH OTHERS TAKE LEADERSHIP AND EXERCISE SELF DISCIPLINE. I TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN STUDY FOUND THAT EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND STILL THE SKILLS AND VALUES. THAT MATTER FOR CAREER SUCCESS. OPPORTUNITY THIS TO CONNECT WITH SUPPORTIVE ADULTS AND PARTICIPATE WITH PEERS IN MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES. HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HELP YOUTH DEVELOP NEW SKILLS AND PERSONAL TALENTS. YOU THINK GAUGE AN EXTRA CURRICULAR PROGRAMMING REDUCE RISKY AND PROBLEM BEHAVIOR AND OFTEN BECOME INVOLVED IN IMPROVING THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND FINALLY SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ADULTS CAN MITIGATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON CHILDREN OF EXPOSURE TO TRAUMA AND WE KNOW THAT MOST OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO TRAUMA. EITHER BEFORE THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE SYSTEM AND OR. BECAUSE OF THEIR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE SYSTEM. SO WITH IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT THE RESEARCH HAS TO SAY ON THIS TOPIC. AND. WE NO THAT FOR HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE. EMBEDDED IN NETWORKS OF FAMILIES FRIENDS AND COMMUNITIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH THE GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT AND HELP THAT THEY NEED. UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEM OFTEN DISCONNECTS YOUTH. FROM THE SUPPORTIVE NETWORKS. ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES HELP YOUNG PEOPLE REBUILD THE SUPPORTIVE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY NEED AND DEVELOP A SENSE OF BELONGING. ALSO THIS INVESTMENT IN ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES FOR FOSTER YOUTH THE SMALL. COMPARED TO THE LONG TERM HUMAN AND FINANCIAL COSTS OF POOR OUTCOMES FOR FOSTER YOUTH. WHEN THEY DO NOT HAVE THESE EXPERIENCES TO THRIVE SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THIS BUDGET ASKING RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT IT TO FAKE. HE CAME. NEXT WE HAVE PLAYED THOSE STRIPE. HI MY NAME IS PLATO'S STRAY CAT AM I AM CURRENTLY. WORKING WITH K. CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTION OF THE POLICY ADMINISTRATIVE COORDINATOR. TODAY I COME TO BRING MY TESTIMONY AT. AND. SO WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL I WAS UNABLE TO JOIN US AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND JUST BECAUSE THE FUNDING IN TRANSPORTATION. ADD TO AND FROM NEEDS IN GAMES AYE I FELT LEFT OUT AND CONFINED BECAUSE OF MY. BECAUSE OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN EVERYTHING THAT THAT OTHER KIDS WERE ABLE TO PARTAKE IN. JUST SAID. PERHAPS A BIT THE SCHOOL BAND DRAMA CLUB OR ANY SPORT MAY BE AN ACTIVITY ARE FAST YOU ARE INTERESTED IN JOINING BY ALLOWING FOR US TO USE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE DIVERSE INTERESTS TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. TO DISCOVER WHAT THEY'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT ONCE YOU'RE HAD CHILDREN FIND AN ACTIVITY THAT THEY ENJOY SUCCEEDING IS IN AND THE ACTIVITY COULD ULTIMATELY. BUILD THE CONFIDENCE AND SELF ESTEEM. ANOTHER BENEFIT OF AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES IS THAT. THEY LOOK. GREAT ON COLLEGE APPLICATIONS IN ADDITION TO ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. MANY COLLEGES LOOK AT WHAT ACTIVITIES SCHOOL THAT STUDENTS ARE INVOLVED IN OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL AS A WAY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND EACH STUDENT. I THINK THAT. STUDENT SOCIAL LIFE IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THEIR ACABAN ACADEMIC LIFE PREPARED DEVELOPMENT STUDIES. SO CORRELATION BETWEEN IMPROVED GRADES BEHAVIOR AND WORK HABITS AS A RESULT AND AFTER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES AND THAT I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT US. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT WE HAVE VALERIE EARLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VALERIE EARLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WE HAVE NO FORMAL POSITION ON THIS. PROPOSAL. BUT IF THIS BECOMES A DEFINITELY A LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY WE WILL WORK WITH.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR OF RUMBLE LA AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS SONNY SET BY SO CALLED BE AFTER YOU AND I AM THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY. ALAMEDA COUNTY IS HONORED TO BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. AND THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY TO BRING FOR THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL. CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ACCOUNTING. OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND A COUNTY CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT A SPONSORED NON CITIZEN WOULD GO HUNGRY. AND HOMELESS WITHOUT AID. AND DETERMINE HIM OR HER TO BE INDIGENT. FOR YOUR REFERENCE CAL FRESH AND CAL WORKS INDIGENCE DETERMINATIONS ARE ONLY VALID FOR A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. AND CAL FRESH PROGRAM THESE DETERMINATIONS ARE RENEWABLE ANNUALLY WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS. HOWEVER IN CAL WORKS THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR RENEWAL. AN INDIGENT EXCEPTION MAY ONLY BE GRANTED ONCE IN A SPONSORED NON CITIZENS LIFETIME. REMOVING UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO SUPPORT INTO ENGINE IMMIGRANTS IT'S CRITICAL. ESPECIALLY NOW DURING A TIME OF FEDERAL UNCERTAINTY. IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INTENTION EXCEPTION FOR SPONSORED NON CITIZENS IS THE REGULATION BUT IS A HUNDRED PERCENT STATE FUNDED. IN ALAMEDA COUNTY THIS WOULD MEAN ASSISTING LESS THAN FORTY INDIVIDUALS A YEAR TO RECEIVE THIS BENEFIT. TO GET A GENERAL SENSE OF THE IMPACTED POPULATION WE REACHED OUT TO OUR NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. FOR DATA FOR FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. IN RESPONSE WE RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING COUNTIES. FOR MONTEREY. THIRTY FOUR. FOR FRESNO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE. FOR SAN FRANCISCO A HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN. WHILE SMALL IN NUMBER IT WOULD HELP OUR COMMUNITIES TREMENDOUSLY. WITH YOUR INDULGENCE I'D LIKE TO READ INTO THE RECORD TESTIMONY FROM AN ALAMEDA COUNTY CLIENT. WHO WAS HESITANT TO COME FORWARD? OUT OF FEAR OF THE GOVERNMENT BUT WANTED TO SHARE HIS STORY. MY NAME IS MISTER PRESCOTT. I RIDE TO THE UNITED STATES FROM TONGA WITH MY WIFE AND CHILD. AS SPONSORED NON CITIZENS AND TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. I WAS GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. UNTIL ONE TRAGIC MORNING IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN GETTING READY FOR WORK I SUFFERED A STROKE. HAVING LIMITED RESOURCES AND KNOW CONTACT WITH MY SPONSOR I APPLIED FOR CAL WORKS. THE AID REALLY HELPED ME WHEN WE HAD NO OTHER INCOME. BUT THE CASH WAS CUT OFF AFTER ONE YEAR. AND WE SUFFERED. WE COULD NO LONGER PAY OUR RENT. OR ARE BILLS. I HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME EVEN THOUGH I WAS STILL RECUPERATING FROM MY STRIP. FINDING EMPLOYMENT WITH A CHALLENGE AS MY PHYSICAL ABILITIES WERE LIMITED. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE MY CHILD AND WIFE SUFFER. TODAY I AM LUCKY TO HAVE A JOB. BUT IF I LOSE MY JOB. I'M ONLY ONE PAYCHECK AWAY FROM LOSING MY HOME. PROPOSALS LIKE VIS. WELL HELP US PROVIDE THE BASIC NECESSITIES FOR A FAMILIES. PLEASE HELP US PASSED THIS SO THAT OUR CHILDREN CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEVE IN THIS COUNTRY. IN CLOSING. NO HUMAN. SHOULD HAVE TO FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF GOING HOMELESS OR HUNGRY INCLUDING IMMIGRANTS. PLEASE HELP PROTECT THE PRESCOTT'S OF OUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR ATTACK. GIVEN. IT KEVIN AS THE COALITION CALIFORNIA WELFARE RIGHTS ORGANIZATION. IT'S HARD TO ADD MUCH TO THAT EXCEPT THAT THE WE'VE SEEN. OF PEOPLE HAVE SPONSORS IN OF TO SPONSOR DIES OF THE SPONSOR BECOMES ABUSED SERVE OR THIS BONTA BECOMES DISABLED IN THIS. THE THEN THE SPONSORSHIP WILL DOESN'T APPLY. AND THE THIRD CATEGORY WITH SPONSORS ABANDONED. THE PERSON THAT THIS BOTH SPONSOR FOR THEM THERE'S THE INVENTIONS EXCEPTION. AND FOR SOME WITHIN CALIFORNIA AFTER TWELVE MONTHS TO JUST DUMP YOUR. BUT THEN LIKE CAL WORK THEY SHOULD BE DETERMINED EVERY TWELVE MONTHS. C.
