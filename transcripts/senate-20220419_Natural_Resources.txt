CAL FOR BLAME. HAVE RESULT WELLS ADDITIONALLY CURRENT LAW GRANTS CAL JIM THE AUTHORITY TO MANDATE AN ADDITIONAL BOND AMOUNT ON TOP OF THE BASE AMOUNT ON WELLS THAT THEY DEEM AT RISK WHICH COULD COST A SMALL INDEPENDENT OIL PRODUCER UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS PER WELL. IF YOU ALSO INCLUDE THE ASSESSED FEES AND TAXES PRODUCERS PAY INTO INCLUDING OIL AND GAS AND GEOTHERMAL MINISTRY DEFEND AND THE HAZARDOUS AND IDLE DESERTED WELF AND ABANDONMENT FUND SMALL INDEPENDENT OIL PRODUCERS ARE LOOKING AT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PAID OUT ON MONEY THAT THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO USE TO SHUT DOWN IMPROPERLY ABANDON THEIR WELLS. OIL PRODUCERS PLUG. WELLS ALL THE TIME AT THE COST OF DOING IN THE PAST OF DOING THIS PLUGGING AND ABANDONING WELLS- SOLELY REP REST ON THE PRODUCER. I WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WHAT HAPPENS THROUGH THE STATE ADDITIONALLY INDUSTRY EXPERTS HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT INDEMNITY BONDS ARE GENERALLY- COMMERCIALLY AND BILLABLE PRODUCERS. CITING CURRENTS K. DISK TRYS. BOB THAT FIGHTS CHAIRS MOST NO FIND BENEFIT ISSUING FUND. TO KNOWS IS THAT WITH THE CHANGE THE DATE. INCOME DOING IT CALIPHS. THESE SIRS. OF A YOUR MOUTH. IT DOES THIS FOR THIS BUSINESS TO. WE CANNOT ARE WE PAINT NUMBER WITH A BROAD BRUSH AND BRUSH AND OIL PRODUCERS AND BECAUSE OF THEIR LIABILITIES AND COSTS CAN VARY WIDELY I MEAN ON THE LOCATION DIGITALIZED GO PROFILE OF THE POTENTIAL WELL AND OTHER ISSUES EACH PRODUCED IN THE CIVIC CENTER BESTED TO PLUG THEM WHEN THEY WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT YOU SHOULD ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA WILL SERVE. MANY RECENT EIGHTEEN ANTI COMMISSION BILLS RATHER THAN POLICIES THE HINDER COMPANY'S ABILITY TO THRIVE. SB ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE ALSO AIMS AT KEEPING CALIFORNIA SMALL INDEPENDENT OIL PRODUCERS IN BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTABLE WHILE AFFORDING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR OWN FUNDS BUILT OVER TIME TO RESPONSIBLE AND EFFICIENT EFFICIENTLY. PLUG AND ABANDON THEIR WELLS SB ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE ACHIEVES THIS BY ALLOWING SMALL INDEPENDENT OIL. TO ESTABLISH A STEVENS ACCOUNT. THE BONDING THAT THEY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A RATE OF 5% OF THEIR ANNUAL REVENUE. THIS ACCOUNT WILL BE VERIFIED BY CAL JAM THROUGH AN ANNUAL AUDIT IN THE END OF ALL THIS ACCOUNT INFORMATION MY FIRST WITNESS TO TESTIFY BY PHONE TODAY ON A S. B. ELEVEN TWENTY FIVE IS MISTER HOWARD K. HOOD. BELIEVES HE HE IS A FORTUNE- SINCE INDEPENDENT OIL OPERATOR WHERE HIS FAMILY THE SMALL WELLS THAT THEY HAVE THE SMALL MINIMUM OF WILL. OUR JOB. INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THEIR JOB THIS FAMILY OPERATES A SMALL-NUMBER OF WELLS THAT IS PROVIDED FOR THEIR FAMILY OVER THE LAST FEW AND FEW YEARS AGO ACTUALLY GENERATIONS- MR KATE IS AVAILABLE BY PHONE SIR. VERY GOOD- SO WE'LL WE'LL TURN FIRST TOWARD LEAD SPORT WITNESS HERE ON THE PHONE MISTER K. WHAT. IF YOU HERE WITH US MODERATOR FEW COLLEAGUES PORT WITH. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S HOWARD K. WHAT PROCEED WITH MORNING I'M- I'M ACTUALLY A THIRD GENERATION INDEPENDENT OIL PRODUCER OF. THE AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN WOULD PUT ME OUT OF BUSINESS. AS FAR AS HAVING THE BOND ALL MY PRODUCING WELLS. AND MY LIABILITY SO I CAME UP WITH A SAVINGS TO CAL. AND SO I WROTE THAT. BUILDER I HAVE ALREADY SAVED ENOUGH TO ABANDON ONE WHILE WITHIN TWO MONTHS THREE MONTHS. I THINK I THINK UNDER THE STATE'S RULING OF AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN. HE CALIFORNIA WOULD NOT BE PROTECTED YOU JUST END UP WITH A BUNCH AN ORPHAN WELLS PEOPLE JUST WALK AWAY FROM HOME. REGARDLESS OF THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THIS BILL. YOU HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO SAVE THE MONEY AND ABANDONED THE WELLS. AS YOU NEED TO. AND AT THE STATE FALLS THROUGH WITH THE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. THEN WE'D ALL HAVE ABOUT TO MEET OUR LIABILITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- I THINK WE HAVE ONE MORE LEAD SUPPORT WHEN HIS HEARING THE HEARING ROOM THREE ONE TIME SURE STERN AND MEMBERS- JOHN ONE TIME FOR THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE APPRECIATE SENATOR GROW BRINGING THIS FORWARD IS A CRITICAL BILL HAS BEEN MENTIONED AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN FROM TWENTY NINETEEN ALLOWED CAL JIM TO REQUIRE BONDS OF UP TO THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER. OF AS OF THIS SIZE SIMPLY ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN CAL. THIS BILL WILL. BY WITH CURRENT LAW COMPANIES ARE HAVING TROUBLE FINDING BONDS EVEN IN THE ONE TO TWO MILLION DOLLAR RANGE SAYS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES INSURANCE COMPANIES TO GUARANTEE THE BONDS IN PERPETUITY EVEN IF THE PLICY OWNER GOES DEFUNCT OR DOES NOT PAY THE PREMIUMS INDEMNITY BONDS ARE ONLY EXERCISE WHEN COMPANIES GO COMPLETELY OUT OF BUSINESS IT'S IN THE STATE'S BEST INTEREST FOR OIL PRODUCERS TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO PLUG AND ABANDON THEIR OWN IDLE WELLS. WITH THEIR OWN MONEY KEEP IN MIND THAT THE IDYLLWILD MANAGEMENT PROGRAM REQUIRES OIL AND GAS PRODUCER'S TO PLUG AND ABANDON 425% OF THEIR IDLE WELLS EACH YEAR IN ORDER TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN PRODUCER SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO SAVE CAPITAL INTO SECURED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE ACTUAL PLUGGING AN ABANDONED BAND ANOTHER WELL. S. WHAT IT- IS THIS FOR COMPANIES TO STAY BY. IF THE PROBE ESTABLISHED IN AB TWO SAID SIMPLY RELIES ON THE INDEMNITY BONDS THAT ARE COMMERCIALLY UNAVAILABLE IN AN EFFORT TO PROTECT THE STATE AGAINST THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL LIABILITY OF ORPHANED WELLS. THE PROGRAM RISKS BECOMING A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY. COMPANIES WILL BE FORCED OUT OF BUSINESS SINCE THEY ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN THE BONDS REQUIRED AND- THEN CLICK. CLOSE WHEN AB FIFTY SEVEN WAS DEBATED MANY INSURANCE WERE ASSURANCES WERE GIVEN. BY THE AUTHOR ITS SUPPORTERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE WOULD BE FLEXIBILITY. THIS BILL CREATES THE FLEXIBILITY AND WOULD FULFILL THOSE PROMISES ABOUT RESPECT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.

AT THIS JUNCTURE VERY GOOD THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS WILL BRING BACK TO DIS COMMENTS QUESTIONS- I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW THE- I. SINCERELY APPRECIATE. THEM MISTER K. WAS TESTIMONY N. N. CREATIVITY IN ATTEMPTING TO. TRY TO FASHION SOME SOLUTION AND I ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S- REPEATED EFFORTS TO RAISE THIS THE DISPARITY ISSUE BETWEEN LARGE AND SMALL PRODUCERS- IN HER DISTRICT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE WE KNOW THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND- AND FRANKLY THE FACT THAT- AS A WHOLE THE INDUSTRY IS EXEMPT FROM LIABILITY PRIOR TO NINETEEN NINETY SIX OWNERSHIP- CREATES THIS UNDERLYING DYNAMIC WHERE ANYONE WHO'S AND- INCURRED OWNERSHIP. EITHER PASSED THAT- IS SMALL FOLKS HAVE HELD IT FROM BEFORE THEN PUT A LOT OF- POLITE PUTS A LOT OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ON ONLY THE CURRENT OWNERS AND NOT PREVIOUS OPERATORS WHICH IS THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT THE HITCH I'M HAVING WITH THIS BILL. IS THAT WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THAT AIM A. B. TEN FIFTY SAID. FROM IN THE LEGISLATURE WE PASSED IN RECOGNIZING THIS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH FOR THE AUTHOR BUT- WE ALLOW FOR THE INSTRUMENTS LIKE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO BE USED TOWARDS THE BONDING REQUIREMENTS. BUT NOT IN THE STRUCTURE THIS BILL AND THE CONCERN IS THAT IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GOING WELL BY WELL AND YOUR YOUR SORT OF BITE AND SEGMENTING YOUR FIELD IN YOUR OPERATIONS. IF SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN ON A EITHER MULTI WILL BASIS OR FOR THE ENTIRE FIELD THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE MEANS TO HANDLE- THAT COST IT WILL END UP GOING BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS- IT WHEN WITH. WHEN THE TEN FIFTY SEVEN KICKS IN AND WE ARE GONNA START GETTING MORE DATA BACKED. BE CURIOUS FROM THE OFF. TO ACTUALLY THE SPONSORS OF THE TESTIMONY IS WHETHER. WE HAVE ANY DAY DATE BACK YET FROM THE OPERATOR SIDE WHETHER THOSE LIABILITIES OR SORT OF OUTWEIGHING THE BONDING CAPACITY RIGHT NOW OR THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THAT IT'S VERY HARD TO MAKE A DECISION ON THESE KIND OF REFORM SO THAT'S WHY I'M I'M NOT INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE AT THIS MOMENT BUT I REALLY WOULD INVITE THAT KIND OF INPUT BECAUSE- CAPITALIZATION COMPARED TO LIABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT. DYNAMIC TO GET RIGHT. I GET IN A CERTAIN CASE LIKE MR K. WOULD WE CAN SORT OF AT MY GRANDMA'S THAT BUT AT. WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING FOR THE WHOLE THE WHOLE SPACE AND WITHOUT THAT INFORMATION IT'S- IT'S HARD TO MOVE FOR BUT I. I WOULD INVITE YOUR YOUR FEEDBACK THEIR- TEST. FOR ON THAT. BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THE MEASURE- TODAY- IN THIS FORM BUT OTHERS ARE WELCOME TO MAKE MOTIONS OR WHATEVER THEY THEY MAY WISH- IF YOU WANT IF YOU WANT TO ADEQUATE RESPONSE YET PLEASE YES IT'S THE CHAIR AND I HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE DISPARITY. OF THE WAY TEN FIFTY SEVEN IST FACTS- THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS VERSES THE LARGE- THE LARGE BUSINESS OWNERS IT IS A DISPARITY ISSUE IT'S A BLANKET BILL. AT THAT REQUIRE SOMEBODY LIKE AN MISTER KAY WHO HAS PROBABLY THIRTEEN WELL AS IT'S BEEN IN HIS FAMILY FOR FIVE THREE. RUNS AND IT'S THERE IT'S WHAT THEY PAID TO PUT THEIR KIDS% THROUGH COLLEGE IT'S THEIR JOB TO HIM AND THE KIDS AND HIS FATHER AND HIS GRANDFATHER BEFORE HIM WOULD GO OUT AND WORK THE WELLS AFTER SCHOOL BEFORE SCHOOL. OF FOR THE KIDS AND THAT WAS THEIR JOB RIGHT THAT'S HOW THEY MADE THEIR INCOME THAT'S HOW THEY PAID FOR THEIR SMALL HOUSE IN TAFT THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD INCOME JUST LIKE US. THERE'S NO WAY THAT THE SMALL INDEPENDENT OIL COMPANIES CAN BOND FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE THEY'RE NOT WORTH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THESE BONDS ARE EVEN AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO THIS BILL SIMPLY ADDS AN AVENUE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AND AS MR K. WOULD SAID IN TWO MONTHS HE HAS SAVED ENOUGH MONEY IF CAL JIM WOOD AUDIT HIS SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT HE'S ESTABLISHED THE HE CAN ABANDON. THAT IS NOT OPERATION. THIS IS A FAMILY AND MANY OTHER FAMILIES LIKE HIM THAT ARE REPRESENTED IN THIS STATE. A TO HAVE THESE FAMILIES AND JUST GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE THERE'S NO SURE ISSUED BONDS AVAILABLE TO THEM. BECAUSE THE NUMBER WHEN THEY CAN'T AFFORD THEM OR NUMBER TWO THEY'RE JUST NOT IN THE MARKET YOU CAN'T PURCHASE THEM. AND IF THE EVIDENCE WILL SHOW IF YOU GUYS LOOK AT IT THAT. YOU CAN BARELY GET A BOND FOR MILLION DOLLARS POSSIBLY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. BUT YOU HAVE TO. IT'S YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ABOUT THE EQUITY RIGHT ABOUT THE BALANCE. AND SOME MAJOR CORPORATIONS CAN SIGN A LETTER OF CREDIT. AND NEVER EVEN HAVE TO HAVE A BLIP ON THEIR FINANCIAL RAIDERS SCREEN OUT ALL. FAMILIES A HUNDRED OR SO FAMILIES THAT OPERATE LIKE THE K. WOODS DO. THEY HAVE TO HAWK THEIR HOME THEIR- EVERYTHING DOWN TO THE PAPER TOWELS IN THE CUPBOARD TO EVEN ACQUIRE A BOND. NOT AVAILABLE THE STATE ACCOUNT. AS MR MONTAIGNE SAID BECAUSE OF THE INSURANCE PURPOSES IN THE POLICIES WE PASSED. MISTER CHAIR YOU AND I HAVE HAD LENGTHLY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AN ORPHAN IN ABOUT BEACH IN MALIBU ACROSS THE STATE. THIS IS A SOLUTION AND THE OIL PERSON I REPRESENT 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL THIS IS A TRUE SOLUTION. TO THE PROBLEM THE CALLER ANNA WHO CALLED IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SAYS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO OIL IN CALIFORNIA. WELL I DID A PRESENTATION LAST WEEK THAT THAT YOU'RE ALLOWED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE FOR FURTHER CONVERSATION. CALIFORNIANS USE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EVERY DAY AND IT'S GOT TO COME FROM SOME PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT REDUCED OUR PROJECTS ARE USE. OR CONSUME. SO WE'RE GETTING IT RIGHT NOW BY BULLDOZING DOWN THE AMAZON RAINFOREST WE ARE GETTING IT FROM COUNTRIES THAT ARE HOSTILE TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY THEY HANG THEM THEY BEAT THEM. WE GET NEW OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA WHERE THEY DON'T LET WOMEN VOTE OR WOMEN DRIVE. AND WE FIND THAT BECAUSE- CONSUMPTION HAS NOT CHANGED SO THE IDEA IS TO BRING FORTH GOOD SOLUTIONS LIKE THIS ONE AND I KNOW YOU DON'T AGREE BUT IT REALLY IS. IF YOU WANT TO WORK ON A CONVERSATION LET IT OUT OF THE- COMMITTEE WILL WORK ON IT. I GIVE YOU MY WORD WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER ON THINGS FOR A LONG TIME. SO IF THIS COULD GO FORWARD M. I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS ABOUT NOT SUPPORTING IT- WE COULD WORK OUT A SOLUTION THAT ACTUALLY HELPS BENEFIT THE SMALL PRODUCERS. DOESN'T FORCE THEM OUT OF BUSINESS AND WILL ALSO BRING SOME TYPE OF EQUITY WITH TEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH- AGAIN NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED BECAUSE WE DO HAVE ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELLS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF I'M ON YOUR SIDE ON THAT. I GET THAT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE A VIABLE SOLUTION AND PUTTING SMALL INDEPENDENT OPERATORS OUT OF BUSINESS. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO BOND OR PURCHASE A BOND IS NOT A GOOD SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT CENTER. YES THIS RESTAURANT JUST TO. AB QUICK CLARIFICATION- YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU WEREN'T INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT WHICH I UNDERSTAND AND- SO. MAYBE WITH THE AUTHORED YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THAT YOU ALL HAVE HAD VERY SUBSTANTIAL OF- CONVERSATIONS REGARDING MULTIPLE THINGS. AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT ON THE SPOT BUT IS THERE WILL YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SAID I'VE GOT AN IDEA YOU'RE NOT INCLINED TO SUPPORT IT WHAT WHAT- WHAT WOULD MAKE ME CENTER I COULD THERE'S A DOOR OVER THERE WITH THE DOOR OPEN IS THE NINETEEN NINETY SIX- LIABILITY WAIVER SO IF. IF THE IF LARGE COMPANIES WERE SUBJECT TO UNDERLYING OPERATIONALIZE ABILITY PARTY NINETY SIX SO THAT THEY CAN BACKSTOPS THOSE KIND OPERATIONS THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE FAIR TO ENDEAVOR INTO THIS SORT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR THE CURRENT OPERATORS BUT IF THERE'S NO BACKSTOP. AND IT'S ALL ON TAXPAYERS BEHIND THAT. THAT'S A THAT'S WHY CURRENT SO THAT'S SO I JUST WANT TO CORRECT THAT YEAR IN THE RESPONSE AND THOUGHT NO DISRESPECT TO YOU ALL WITH IT'S NOT ON TAXPAYERS AND THE ORPHANED AND ABANDONED WELL FUN OTHER THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECENTLY PUT INTO IT FROM THE BUDGET IN THE ACCESS THAT WE HAVE IS TAXPAYERS BUT OIL COMPANIES ARE TAXPAYERS TOO. WHETHER THEY PAY OILED- TAXES WITH THE PAY FEES PENALTIES EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES WAGES TAXES SO PART OF THAT MANY USERS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE- A MAJORITY OF ALL A CAL JIM OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED BY. THE END OF IT THE PRODUCERS- THE ORGANIZATION THEMSELVES THE INDUSTRY THEY OPERATIONS AND THEN CAL JIM'S OPERATIONS INCLUDE OR IN AN ABANDONED WELL FUNDS- WHICH IS A SOLUTION THAT I BROUGHT TO YOU BEFORE THAT WOULD BENEFIT LABOR BENEFIT THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THE PRODUCERS. YOU CLICK ACCESS THINK THAT YOU A THIS IS PROBABLY A BAD MAY SINCE I'M TO BEG YOUR VOTE BUT IF YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO BE HERE FOR ANOTHER YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE A SUPERVISOR I'D REALLY LIKE TO WORK WITH SOMEBODY OF ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT REALLY KNOWS THAT I'M HERE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BY APPRECIATE YOUR ROUTING- I TOOK THAT AS A COMPLIMENT I DO I TAKE SOME KIND OF COMPLEMENT THE LIKE DISLIKE OKAY. I REMEMBER LET. SEND ME A LIKE IT OR THE ORDER THEM TO ME CHAIR FIVE CAN- I MAKE THE MOTION FOR THE BILL AND YOU KNOW IF YOU CAN YOU KNOW IF YOU FEEL LIKE THERE'S CONCERT CONVERSATION M. AND THE BILL FORWARD SO THAT YOU AN AUTHOR CAN KEEP YOU KNOW HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A PRODUCTIVE WAY TO MOVE FORWARD- YOU KNOW ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT. THE PERSON THAT SPOKE IN OPPOSITION I THINK THAT WAS VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIANS TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE THERE THERE IS A THERE'S A- AS AN INTEREST GROUP IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T AND I DON'T KNOW THAT LADY WAS FROM OR- IF SHE'S EVEN WITH THE GROUP BUT THERE'S A- THERE THERE'S A GROUP OF. CITIZENS IN IN CALIFORNIA THAT BELIEVE THAT WITHOUT. LADY SAID THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE WHAT IN CALIFORNIA. WELL I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR AND MANY PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW WE KEEP MOVING UP THE TIME FRAME FROM TWENTY FORTY TO THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY TO TWENTY SEVEN TOTAL YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT'S GONNA BE. BUT WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND I THINK WE HAVE TO BE. REASONABLE PEOPLE HERE ON THE DÍAS TO RECOGNIZE THAT WORLD. A LONG WAYS IF THE ULTIMATE GOAL BY SOME PEOPLE IN THE STATE IS TO GET TO ZERO OIL THAT'S THE ULTIMATE GOAL AND I'M CERTAINLY THAT'S NOT MY GOAL BUT IF THAT IS THE GOAL AND THAT'S WHERE THE- ALL ASEAN CALIFORNIA'S GONNA MOVE. WELL WE'RE A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM THAT AND SO IN THE MEANTIME WE'VE GOT TO COME UP WITH A REASONABLE SOLUTION SUCH AS WHAT CENTER GROVE IS SUGGESTING AND THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE HAVING CHORE SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THE MOTION- SO I BELIEVE THE MOTION IS TO PASS- YES. SIR LEONARD. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER CHAIR I THINK. THE DIFFICULT THING HERE IS WE HAVE A BILL THAT WAS ENACTED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER. IT NEEDS A CHANCE TO WORK I THINK THE AUTHOR IS SAYING IT DOESN'T WORK. AND IS DOING THIS. ALREADY AND WHEN. HE NOTWITHSTANDING THE CONVERSATION THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH HERE. YOU WERE TRYING TO. BOUNCE BETWEEN TWO GOALS. THE GOALS OF WHAT KEEPS. SMALL INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS BUT THE GOALS THAT I EXPERIENCED AND I HESITATE TO MENTION. JOHN BECAUSE IT MAKES. SENSE OUR ARMED BUT BUT IN MY JOB WE HAD TO DO WITH BILLIONS DOLLARS OF UNFUNDED ORPHAN WELLS AND WAS GOING TO FALL ON THE TAXPAYERS AND THAT BILL WAS ENACTED SO THAT THAT PRACTICE WOULD STOP. A. N. SO V. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS MAY BE A PLACE TO GO AT SOME POINT BUT IT'S NOT TOTALLY RIPE YET. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ALLOW THE OTHER THING I WISH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WAS HERE THERE'S THE SIMULTANEOUS HEARING SAID SHE'S NOT HERE I THINK SHE COULD OFFER US A PERSPECTIVE IF YOU WERE SITTING HERE AS WELL. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR TO KEEP. A CONVERSATION GOING BUT I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS ROCKED AND- BOB AND- YOU KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO APPRECIATE SOMEBODY THAT ARE- MORE THAN ADEQUATELY REPRESENTS THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I JUST KNOW. THAT THE AUTHOR DOES BUT- AND I JUST CHECKED THAT'S WHERE WE ARE PRESHEAF THE COMMENTS SENATOR- SO. ARE YOU I GUESS I'LL CLARIFY. SAN WOULD YOU LIKE THEM FOR. FROM THE VICE CHAIR TO BE ON THE BILL AS IS WITH NO RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR OR WOULD YOU PREFER- THE MOTION BE ON AMENDMENT TO ADD IN THE STRIKING OF THE- NINETY SIX EXEMPTION LIABILITY AND ADDING THAT TO THE BILL AND THEN. I WOULD BE OPEN TO SUPPORTING. SO THEN I CAN'T SAY YES TO THAT SIR IN THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE AND EVEN THOUGH I REPRESENT 70% OF THE STATE'S OIL I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AND I'M JUST BEING HONEST AND NINE NINETY SIX SO- IF WE COULD HAVE A DISCUSSION ON YET. MAYBE I DON'T KNOW PETITIONS TO RECONSIDER I DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. RIGHT pAND IF. IF I IF I KNEW THE GOODS AND BADS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THAT MY COLLEAGUE. WHO IS THE FORMER SECRETARY OF. RESOURCES HE HE GROANS MODE YES SO HE- HE BRINGS THAT IT CONSISTENTLY AND- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND IN BECAUSE THAT'S MAKE THE BILL RIGHT. RIGHT IT'S NOT RIGHT YET BUT LET'S MAKE IT RIGHT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU GUYS ARE HANGING YOUR HAT AGAIN ON A BILL THAT PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA BACK FROM. BUT ON THE GROUND SMALL INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS. CANNOT GET AN ASSUREDLY BOND YOU KEEP IT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE IT WOULD BE LIKE ASKING YOU SIR AND I KNOW YOU HAVE. YOUR PERSON OF MEANS YOU PROVIDE FOR YOUR FAMILY BUT I WANT YOU TO COME UP WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. AND MAYBE YOUR DAD COULDN'T I CAN'T. I CAN'T COME UP WITH THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE SMALL PRODUCERS CAN'T AND THERE'S NOT AN INSURANCE LIABILITY I CREATED TO WORKERS COMP IN THE REAL WORLD I'M A BUSINESS OWNER. AFTER THAT IN BECAUSE HE HATES THAT IMMIGRANTS. AND AS A BUSINESS OWNER IN ORDER TO PROVIDE WORKERS COMP WE HAD TO COME UP WITH A TWO MILLION DOLLAR BOND. WHAT IS NOT WORTH TO KNOW. SO IT'S JUST THE I. CAN SET THE WORK FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS IN THE- PRODUCE. AND EQUITY LIKE I SAID MAJOR COMPANIES BLIP ON THERE DOESN'T EVEN. AFFECT THEM UNDERSTOOD MILLION IS NOTHING TO TAKE THEIR CLOTHES. SURE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TELL ME JUST FOR THE RECORD YES- I DON'T. EIGHT HOUR AGO YOUR- A GENTLEMAN WORDS SHOW IN THE TWO YEARS. SENATOR LAYERED- EARLIER RECORD SHE SHE- CALLED ME REGULAR THE RULES.

HE'S INSURANCE PLEASE- PLEASE FEEL THE FEEL THE PRINT FEEL FREE TO PRESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SENATE BILL ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN THE WATER INNOVATION ACT AND DROUGHT RESILIENCY. ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING A PROFOUND IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEMS ALONG WITH AGING INFRASTRUCTURE ONE GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION SUBSIDENCE AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SIGMA. NU IN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO MEET AND OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES WHILE OUR STATE IS A BEACON OF INTERVIEW. IN OTHER UTILITY BASED MARKETS LIKE ENERGY CALIFORNIA'S WATER SECTOR FALLS BEHIND OTHER AREAS AND EVEN OTHER COUNTRIES IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADOPTION OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. SB ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN WOULD ESTABLISH THE INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE WATER INNOVATION AND DROUGHT RESILIENCY AT THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THEM IMPORTANT THING ABOUT THIS IS DROUGHT RESILIENCY WE NEED TO ESTABLISH- CALIFORNIA AS A STATE THAT IS DROUGHT RESISTANT. THE INITIATIVE WOULD COORDINATE WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO HELP ACHIEVE ITS GOALS WHICH INCLUDE REVIEWING REGULATIONS THAT THAT MAY LIMIT OR INHIBIT INNOVATION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STREAMLINING. OR REVISING THOSE REGULATIONS OPR IS TASKED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY AS IT IS THE IN THE BEST POSITION TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS FROM A VARIETY OF PERSPECTIVES. AND DURING DETERMINE WHAT MAY BE THE BEST WAYS TO ADVANCE INNOVATION IN THE WATER SECTOR. FROM BETTER DATA MANAGEMENT TO SEEK REFORM THERE ARE A MULTITUDE OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR REMOVING OBSTACLES IN THIS AREA. BUT IT WILL TAKE A THOROUGH REVIEW BY OPR TO ISOLATE THE BEST EXAMPLES FOR MAKING POSITIVE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY THE INITIATIVE WILL REVIEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PILOT PROGRAMS ISSUE GRANTS TO WATER AGENCIES FOR EVALUATING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IN THEIR WATER SYSTEMS. AND REVIEW INVESTMENT TRENDS FOR INNOVATION WATER UTILITIES RATEPAYERS AND ECOSYSTEMS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE BROADER ADOPTION OF WATER INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS CORRECTLY STATES THAT THERE ARE SOME. CURRENT WORKING A DRESS INNOVATION. BUT THIS BUT THE STATE SHOULD NOT SHY AWAY FROM ITS IMPORTANT ROLE AS A FACILITATOR AND SUPPORTER A PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FROM BOTH FOR FROM BOTH THESE EFFORTS AND ALSO FROM THE WORK OUTLINED IN THE BILL. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE AS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS MAY NEED LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION IN IMPLEMENT. ESTABLISHING A DEDICATED ENTITY TO FURTHER FURTHER WATER INNOVATION EFFORTS WOULD HELP THE STATE ACHIEVE ITS GOAL OF A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER BY EXPLORING NEW APPROACHES TO SECURE SAFE DRINKING WATER. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS YOU KNOW THIS ISSUE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND IT IS NO EXAGGERATION TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO USE EVERY DROP OF WATER TO ITS FULLEST CAPACITY AND THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. OF OUR COUNTRY'S FOOD SUPPLY DEPEND OUT FOOD SUPPLY AND SAFETY AND SECURITY AND SECURITY DEPENDS UPON OUR DROUGHT PROOFING OUR STATE. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN NINETY SEVEN R.

INNOVATIVE APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR WATER SUPPLY. SENIOR IS MEMBERS HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF PURSUING INNOVATION IN ADOPTING NEW TECHNOLOGIES BUT MORE WORK IS NEEDED. THE INITIATIVE TO ADVANCE WATER INNOVATION AND DROUGHT RESILIENCY OPR WOULD POSITION THE STATE AS A PARTNER AND FACILITATOR FOR INNOVATION IN OUR STATE COMPLEMENTING AND AMPLIFYING. EXISTING ACADEMIC AND OTHER EFFORTS IT WOULD HELP ADVANCE IS STAYING ABILITY AND ACHIEVE THE STATE'S GOAL OF HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND WOULD ALSO ADMIT RECONCILIATIONS AND DATES WITH RESIGN FOR.

CAN READ YOURS HELLO ONE SECOND. YEAH. I AM VERY GOOD WELL MEMBERS I'D LIKE PRESENT SB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE WHICH WOULD- AMENDED IMPORT PROVISION THE COASTAL ACT OF NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX AROUND INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE OIL AND GAS FACILITIES WHAT WE VIEW IS A LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW THAT ALLOWS FOR OIL AND GAS FACILITIES IN THE COASTAL ZONE- TO BE A QUOTE COASTAL DEPENDENT INDUSTRIAL USE WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO BE PERMITTED EVEN IF OTHER PROVISIONS CLOSE LIKE AREN'T SATISFIED- SO THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT. OF THAT KIND OF EXPANDED WILLING GAS DEVELOPMENT FROM BEING CONSIDERED ACOSTA DEPENDENT JUST REALLY USE AND THEREFORE THERE BY EXEMPTING ITSELF FROM CERTAIN OTHER PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE COASTAL ACT AND SUBJECT THAT SAME DEVELOPMENT TO THE VERY SAME PERMITTING REQUIREMENTS THAT EVERY OTHER- COASTAL DEPENDENT USES YOUR BUILDING A HOTEL HOUSING- IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR THE THRESHOLDS ON THAT KIND DEVELOPMENT TO BE HIGHER THAN IT WOULD BE- FOR THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY FOR IT SO FOR THAT REASON WE WANT TO CORRECT THIS- THIS THIS WHOLE IN CALIFORNIA LAW AND IN THE PROCESS- BRING A EVEN. KEEL TO HOW WE DO PERMITTING AROUND THESE KINDS OF FACILITIES- IN THE ZONE- THAT WE KNOW SO SENSITIVE AND WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT- OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST THE HIGH PROFILE STUFF THAT THAT ENDS UP ON OUR SHORES IN ORANGE YOUR SAN DIEGO FROM THE OFFSHORE SPILLS BUT IT'S THE IT'S THE STUFF CLOSER TO HOME- IT'S STORAGE SITES- AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES THAT. THAT STILL IMPEDE HABITAT. YOU HEALTH OF OUR- OCEANS AND FRANKLY UP THE- CAN THAT.

GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO SENIOR LEGISLATIVE MANAGER WITH CALIFORNIA A CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL VOTERS FORMERLY C. LCV. ACCORDING TO A RECENT REPORT BY THE L. A. L. TITLED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. BESIDES AFFECTING NATURAL RESOURCES. THE HAZARDS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAVE MAJOR IMPACTS ON PUBLIC HEALTH. SAFETY AS WELL AS PROPERTY INFRASTRUCTURE AND AS SUCH CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ALL AFFECTS ALL CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS. ALONG WITH THE STATE'S ECONOMY BUDGET HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS TRANSPORTATION AND WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS HOUSING MARKET AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. THE POLICY OUTLINED IN SB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE. IS ONE OF THE MANY STEPS THE STATE CAN TAKE IN ORDER TO UPDATE. AND CHANGE OUTDATED CAL THIS IN IN THIS THE STATURE NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH FAVORS OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN THE COASTAL ZONE. SB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE SIMPLY ASK THE OIL INDUSTRY AND GROWING GAS INDUSTRY TO MEET THE SAME STANDARD OF COASTAL COMMISSION OVERSIGHT AS ALL OTHER COASTAL DEVELOPMENTS. AND TO COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN THE STATE THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT THE VIRTUALLY ALL OTHER PROJECTS MUST COMPLY WITH. THIS BILL REMOVES A LOOPHOLE KNOWN AS THE COASTAL AND DEPENDENT INDUSTRIAL USE OVERRIDE. THE PERMITTING OF OIL AND GAS AND COASTAL ZONE WHICH INCLUDES OFFSHORE OIL DEVELOPMENT IN NEW OR EXPANDED REFINERIES AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS. THE OVER I WAS USED TO APPROVED. A SOMEWHAT RECENT NEW OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN LONG BEACH THIS PROJECT AND OTHERS WERE APPROVED BECAUSE THEY CONFORM WITH THE OVER RIGHT PROPOSED PROVISIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO OIL AND GAS PROJECTS. WELL AT THE SAME TIME ACTUALLY VIOLATING OTHER COASTAL ACT POLICIES. IS TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND IT'S ABOUT TIME THAT THIS OUTDATED LAW BE UPDATED TO STOP ENABLING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT RATIONS THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH CRITICAL PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA LAW. IN REVISING OVER A POLICY THIS BILL RESTRICTS NEW OR EXPANDED OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS PETROCHEMICAL FACILITIES. WELL ACTUALLY ENABLING OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. REMOVING COASTAL ACT POLICY READING BECAUSE ALL POLICIES THAT PROMOTE NEW WORKS IN OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. IS NOT ONLY CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S DECARBONISATION CLIMATE GOALS. BUT AND ALSO ENCOURAGES A TRANSITION AWAY FROM UNSUSTAINABLE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DETRIMENTAL PRACTICE. IS INDUSTRY HAVE EVADED OVERSIGHT IN THE COASTAL COMMISSION SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND IF YOU CAN WRAP UP WE'VE GOT ANOTHER WITNESSES ALSO WANTS TO MINUTES.

THANK YOU MODERATOR APPRECIATE IT ARE WE WILL NOT TAKE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE WILL BEGIN IN THE HEARING ROOM. IF YOU CAN PLEASE GIVE YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND YOUR TWO MINUTE COMMENTS THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS PAUL THE EURO ON BEHALF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE. BECAUSE THE NECESSARY FACILITY IMPROVEMENTS AND RECTOR FITS THAT IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES IN OPERATIONS SHOULD BE CONTINUED TO BE ALLOWED UNDER THE COASTAL DEPENDENT INDUSTRIAL USE PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION TO MEETING THE NEW ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL STANDARDS THAT MOST GAS FACILITIES IN OUR REFINERIES HAVE TO MEET. THEY THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT NEW EQUIPMENTS TO MEET THE REQUIRED SAFETY STANDARDS. WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE EXISTING FIVE CRITERIA THAT ARE USED IT NOW TO BE AN OVERRIDE OR A LOOPHOLE IN FACT IS THIS BILL DOES NOT ALIGN WITH THE BENEFITS OF THE STATE'S EMISSION. REDUCTION AND CLIMATE GOALS BY DELETING THE FIVE MITIGATION PROVISIONS IN THE CALL TO LACK FOR REFINERIES AND PETROCHEMICALS THE BILL WOULD IMPACT THE ABILITY. TO LOAD AND UNLOAD LOWER CARBON PRODUCTS BY NARROWING THE PERMITTING L. BLOODY. IN THESE THESE FACILITY ARE THERE FOR A PURPOSE AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR DECADES AND THAT'S BECAUSE REFINERIES ARE CLOSE TO- TERMINALS AND OIL AND GAS FACILITIES ARE CLOSE TO WHERE YOU WANT LEADERS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXISTING LAW ON THE FIVE CRITERIA ARE SUFFICIENT. A PATH TO GO AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE- THANK YOU NEXT MONTH. JERRY MEMBER SEAN WELL IN TIME FROM THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION TO ADD WHAT MISTER DARO SHARED WITH YOU ALL IN RELATIONSHIP TO OPPOSITION- THE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE BILL INTENDS TO OFFSET OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL BASED FUELS UNFORTUNATELY- THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO OFFSET RELIANCE OR DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS. CALIFORNIA IS EXTREMELY RELIANT ON FOSSIL BASED FUELS AND WE WILL BE FOR DECADES TO COME- IN STATE OIL NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS OPERATE IN THE COASTAL ZONE UNDER THE STRICTEST LAWS RULES AND REGULATIONS ON THE PLANET WHILE PROVIDING THE AFFORDABLE ENERGY CALIFORNIANS SO BADLY NEED EVERY BARREL OF CRUDE OIL NOT PRODUCED IN CALIFORNIA MUST BE PRODUCED OVERSEAS BY BULLDOZING THE AMAZON RAINFOREST IN ECUADOR. NONE OF THE PRODUCERS OVERSEAS ARE SUBJECT TO THE HIGHEST IN THE WORLD CLIMATE MITIGATION STANDARDS CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS ARE SUBJECT TO. WE ALL KNOW THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM AND NOT A CALIFORNIA ONLY PROBLEM BY CURBING COASTAL CRUDE PRODUCTION YOUR INVITING MORE SUPERTANKERS INTO OUR PORTS THIS NOT ONLY EXACERBATES THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS BUT AS HIGH LEVELS OF TOXIC POLLUTION. TO THE LA BASIN FROM TANKER EMISSIONS- CHIPS ARE ONE OF THE HIGHEST POLLUTERS IN THE LA BASIN ACCORDING. TO THE SOUTH COAST AQ ANDY IF ONE TANKER HAS A MISHAP. THE SPELLING OF UP TO ONE MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE ON TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BEACHES WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC. FOR THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE LOCAL ECONOMIES THAT RELY SO HEAVILY ON TOURISM AND RECREATION. AS LONG AS CALIFORNIA USED TO DEMAND ALMOST TWO MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL EVERY SINGLE DAY. THAT ENERGY SHOULD COME FROM CALIFORNIA PRODUCERS PAYING HIGH WAGES TO CALIFORNIA WORKERS PLEASE DO NOT OUTSOURCE OUR ENERGY NEEDS TO COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT SHARE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL VALUES CULTURAL VALUES OR HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS. SEVERAL RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU KNOW ABOUT. THANK YOU RESTAURANT TIME- WILL TAKE WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM THAT WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON IN OPPOSITION TO FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE HI MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBERS MIKE MONACAN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL LINING A REMARKS WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WE ARE. IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU SIR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE HEARING ROOM. MODERATOR IF WE CAN OPEN THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES- AND COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE SB FOURTEEN TWENTY THREE WE'LL TAKE THOSE COLORS NOW. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE'LL GO TO LINE SIXTY ONE GO AHEAD PLEASE. WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT ENERGY PRODUCERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE COULD UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR- WE WILL BRING THE DISCUSSION TO THE DYESS IS THERE ANY MEMBERS WISHING WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE BILL- IS THERE ANY COMMENTARY. COMMENTS YES SIR. CAN I JUST ASK WHILE. I'D LIKE FOR FROM SWANTON EXPAND ON ONE THING THAT HE SAID OF THE STAND THE ROOM- YOU'RE A Q. M. D. COMMENT REGARDING- THE TANKER POLLUTION AIR POLLUTION YEAH I'M NOT SURE THAT MOST OF US HAVE A AND UNDERSTANDING OF THAT WHAT IT WHAT CAN YOU EXPAND ON THEY'LL ABOUT IT WAS A TWENTY NINETEEN STUDY THAT THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT PUT OUT AND ESTIMATED THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE NEXT YEAR. COURTSHIPS WOULD BE THE HIGHEST- SACHSEN KNOCKS POLLUTERS IN THE LA BASIN. AND THOSE ARE THE SHIP TO BRING THE OIL INTO THE COUNTRY IT'S BOTH SUPERTANKERS AND ALSO CARGO VESSELS OKAY GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WE HAVE A MOTION AND I BOUGHT. YES SIR YEAH. COMMENTS ON JUST JUST GENERALLY YOU KNOW I SERVED ON THE COAST COMMISSION AND- AS MANY OF YOU I CHAIR ENERGY AND- CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITELY WORKING VERY HARD TO MOVE IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION TO. BECOME COMPLETELY- LESS RELIANT ON FOSSIL FUELS. AND TO CREATE AN ENERGY SOURCE THAT IS COMPLETELY SUSTAINABLE I THINK THAT'S- A VERY IMPORTANT THING THE KID CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO DO ONE WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED TO THE SENATE. I STARTED SELECT COMMITTEE ON ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND THAT'S ALSO A VERY IMPORTANT GOAL. THAT CALIFORNIA FIND A WAY TO DERIVE ALL ITS ENERGY NEEDS- LOCALLY FROM THE STATE. WHATEVER OUR ENERGY DEMANDS ARE IF WE CAN- ARRIVE THEM ENTIRELY FROM WITHIN OUR OWN STATE THAT WILL HELP TO BUILD. AN ECONOMY THOSE ARE THERE ARE SMART WAYS TO REINVEST ARKEMA ECONOMY TO BUILD WEALTH IN OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT DOING THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. AND WE CAN TAKE WE HAVE TO CONTINUE. AS A STATE AND AS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE STATE DEVELOP A STRATEGY. FOR POWER IN OUR STATE. AND AFFORDABILITY. BUT ALSO. IN A WAY THAT COMBATS CLIMATE CHANGE THAT REDUCES OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT. AND SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE WORK IN IN THAT IN THAT DIRECTION AND THERE IS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BALANCE RIGHT RESPECT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT. RESPECT FOR PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOKS. AND ALSO RESPECT FOR OF OUR ECONOMY WHICH NEEDS TO CREATE. JOBS TO PRODUCE WEALTH AND BE A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THAT'S OFTEN A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO. ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT OUR STATE'S HISTORY. IS THAT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE- WHO IS TO CALIFORNIA'S FAMOUS FOR HAVING PLACES LIKE LA BREA TAR PITS. AND FAMOUS FOR REGULAR- THE YOU KNOW THESE OIL WHAT THEY CALL THESE TAR BALLS THAT HAVE BEEN APPEARING IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE OCEAN NATURALLY FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS AND THAT'S JUST NATURAL SEEPAGE OF WHAT CALIFORNIA'S ALWAYS ALWAYS HAD IN ABUNDANCE OF PUT OF OIL. BELOW THE GROUND THAT AT SOME POINT IN SOME POINTS JUST BEGINS TO JUST COME UP NATURALLY AND NATURALLY CONTAMINATE THE ENVIRONMENT. AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S SOMEHOW OILS ALWAYS BEEN A SOURCE OF DESTRUCTION BECAUSE WHEREVER YOU GO AND THE CARPETS YOU HAVE- FOSSILIZED ANIMALS SYSTEM FELL INTO THESE TARPS THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL PRESERVE. AND IT'S JUST A- PART OF THE REGULAR ENVIRONMENT AND YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT OIL EXTRACTION HAS DONE. IS ACTUALLY REDUCED THOSE NATURAL EMISSIONS IN THOSE NATURAL SPILLS INTO THE FIREMAN BY EXTRACTING OF COURSE. THE I'M NOT ARGUING THAT IT'S GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BY NO MEANS AND IT DOES IT'S VERY DAMAGING. BUT IN THE INTERIM CALIFORNIA HAS A OIL ADDICTION. AND RIGHT NOW IN MY DISTRICT THE COST OF PETROLEUM IS THROUGH THE ROOF THE COST OF GAS IS THROUGH THE ROOF- WHERE WERE SEEN THAT IN INTERNATIONAL STRUGGLE STRUGGLES. THAT THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT WE ARE AS TAXPAYERS ARE FUNDING OPPOSITION TO IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT ARE MAKING IN- ARE ARMING THEMSELVES. OR OFTENTIMES FUNDING TERROR TERRORISM THROUGH WHAT WE PAY FOR AT THE PUMP AND I ALWAYS ASK PEOPLE WHERE WOULD YOU RATHER SOURCE YOUR PETROLEUM CALIFORNIA CREEK CALIFORNIA JOBS OR FROM SAUDI ARABIA OR RUSSIA. OR OR ARE COUNTRIES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO- CONFLICT AND TO A THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES IN ALMOST EVERY TIME PEOPLE SAY CALIFORNIA I'D RATHER BUY CALIFORNIA OIL IF- IF I'M GONNA AND I'D RATHER I'D RATHER NOT HAVE TO BUY OR- AND I'D RATHER PRICES CHEAPER BUT- THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST CHOICE. AND I THINK WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BALANCE THAT DEMAND AS WE TRANSITION OUT OF PETROLEUM AS WE MOVE. TO THE CLEANERS SOURCES WE NEED TO. CONVINCE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE CAN DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOES THAT THAT THAT. THEY SHOULD SUPPORT. THEY SHOULD SUPPORT CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT IS GOING TO CREATE JOBS. AND IT'S NOT GONNA AFFECT YOUR POCKETBOOK TOO MUCH ANNA AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK ON AS A AS A LEADERSHIP. TO PUSH THOSE PROJECTS ARE GET GOING TO GET US TO CLEANING THE ENVIRONMENT REDUCING AIR EMISSIONS BUT AT THE SAME TIME NOT. MAKE PEOPLE REVOLT AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT AND SAY YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO PAY FIVE SIX SEVEN DOLLARS AT THE GAS PUMP. AND YOU KNOW WHY. I DON'T SUPPORT FRACKING BUT I SUPPORT REGULATING IT IF IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT THE ENVIRONMENT. IF THEY CAN PROVE IT'S NOT GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THEY SHOULD DO IT IF IT HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE WHERE WE SHOULDN'T DO IT. AND IF WE CAN EXTRACT OIL WITHOUT AFFECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. I THINK WE SHOULD DO IT FROM CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE WORLD IS THE ENVIRONMENT AND- AND I THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN DO BETTER. AND I THINK WE YOU KNOW OTHERS A REASON WHY OF PETROLEUM IS LISTED AS A CAUSE FOR THE PENNANT USE BECAUSE IN MANY CASES IT'S LOCATED ALONG BECAUSE YOU CAN'T- YOU KEPT- EXTRACT SOMETHING FROM AN AREA. IF YOU CAN ENTER THAT AREA AND YOU I MEAN IT'S AN ALL RIGHT ALL ALL OUT MAN AND THE COASTAL COMMISSION I WAS ON THE COAST COMMISSION WHEN WE TOLD THE NAVY YOU CAN'T YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO AVOID RUNNING OVER WALES AND THEY CHALLENGED US. IN IN- IN COURT SAYING YOU CANNOT TELL THE MILITARY HOW TO PROTECT THE COUNTRY AND CLOSE THE COMMISSION WON THAT BATTLE. I KNOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION HAS- AS DOING A PHENOMENAL PHENOMENAL JOB OF PROTECTING THE COASTLINE. THEY HAVE VERY VERY STRICT. RULES IN TERMS F HOW WHO CAN- SITE THERE DEVELOP THEIR WORK THERE IT'S A- YOU HAVE TO SHOW OF ALMOST NO. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT TO REALLY GET AUTHORIZED. BY THE CLOSE COMMISSION AND GO GET A COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO AND IT'S MORE DIFFICULT. TO EXTRACT OIL IN THE COASTAL ZONE COLONEL IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER PLACE. THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE COASTAL ZONE IN THEIR- AND THEIR OBLIGATION TO PROTECT THE COASTLINE. AND I THINK IF- THAT RESOURCE CAN STILL BE FOUND FOUND THERE GIVEN WHAT I'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF RECENT EVENTS IN THE WORLD IN THE- IN THE IMPACT ON GAS I MEAN THIS THIS BILL. COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF I KNOW BEFORE. OF WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON GAS PRICES. AND IT WENT ANYTHING THAT'S- AFFECT A LEGALLY THAT ANY BILL THAT PASSES AFFECTS OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND HAS HAS A NATURAL EFFECT ON. INCREASING COSTS AND I THINK RIGHT NOW IS THE WRONG TIME. TO LAUNCH THIS CAMPAIGN ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE EXPERIENCE EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST- OIL COSTS. IN IN THE- IN OUR IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND I THINK WE SHOULD BE SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND WORK TO- YOU KNOW. PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH THE WITH THE FUEL THEY NEED BUT ALSO A MOVE IN A DIRECTION WHERE WE CAN WE CAN- CONTINUE OUR STATES GAINES ON ON IMPROVING AIR QUALITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT SO- I THINK THIS IS A VERY NOBLE EFFORT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO AT LEAST DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS AND SAY LOOK OUR THEIR SHOES WERE WEEKEND REGULATE THE OIL INDUSTRY BETTER. ALONG THE COASTAL ZONE- I THINK THERE ARE AND I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT THOSE BUT ON ALL ALL OUT BAN I JUST CAN'T SUPPORT I THINK IT. IT'LL PUT- OUR STATE AT A DISADVANTAGE TO PROVIDE A VERY IMPORTANT COMMODITY AT THIS TIME. IN HISTORY. ARE FOR THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND I AND I I'LL JUST BE LAYING OFF THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SERVICE SO WE HAVE A MOTION- MISTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE SURE AND MAY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE- THE REMARKS MADE A IN MY CLOTHES. AT THIS BILL IS NOT AN ALL OUT BAN ON OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IN THE COASTAL ZONE- DESPITE- MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO LIVE NEAR THESE SITES IN. AND WISH THAT WE COULD JUST WAVE THE WAND AND BE DONE WITH THIS- THIS KIND OF- THIS KIND OF EXTRACTIVE. ECONOMY AND SENSITIVE HABITATS THE BILL DOESN'T DO THAT- THE BILL ACTUALLY SPECIFICALLY LOOK ON PAGE FORTY ANALYSIS THE BILL AUTHORIZES THE PERMITTING. OF NEW WORK EXPANDED OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. IF IT IS FOUND TO BE CONSISTENT. WITH APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE COASTAL ACT THE FACT IS UNDER CURRENT LAW. OIL AND GAS HAVE BEEN GETTING A FREE PASS IN THE COASTAL ZONE. THAT INDUSTRIAL USE IN THE COASTAL DEPENDENT AREAS THAT COASTAL DEPENDENT INDUSTRIES HAS TIED THE HANDS OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION. AS DECIDED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN EXAMPLE WHERE. IT WAS INCONSISTENT THE COASTAL ACT. THEY FOUND. A OIL AND GAS DRILLING PUZZLE AND YET THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. BECAUSE OF THIS LOOPHOLE IN CURRENT LAW. SO THIS BILL DOES NOT CLOSE THESE FACILITIES IT MERELY REQUIRES THEM TO MEET THE-SAME STANDARDS THAT A HOTEL. OR HOUSE OR ANY OTHER COASTAL DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE TO MEET AND NOT SOME SPECIAL STANDARD. SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY AT LEAST WE SHOULD HAVE THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA PLAYING BY THE RULES THAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SUBJECT TO- ENDS AT BEST. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING TOWARDS THE FUTURE- AND IN A PLACE THAT WERE NOT RELIANT ON THIS KIND OF EXTRACTION. THE SUPPOSITION THOUGH THAT THIS WOULD SOMEHOW IMPACT ENERGY PRICES IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER BILL LIES IN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GLOBAL OIL MARKETS WORK. OF THE WAR IN RUSSIA IS WHAT'S DRIVING WILL PRICE INCREASES IT HAS NOTHING TO DO. WITH CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION WHATSOEVER THE IMPACT OF THIS PRODUCTION MARKET AND SPECIFICALLY THESE COASTAL DEPENDENT USES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. DOES NOT AFFECT GLOBAL SUPPLY AT A SCALE THAT IS ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT WE SEE. FROM ALL THE OTHER RESOURCE CONFLICTS SO IT'S A VERY EASY TARGET RIGHT NOW FOR FOLKS TO COME OUT AND SAY. SEE TOO MANY ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WHY THE PRICES ARE SO HIGH. THAT'S NOT WHY WE HAVE SIX DOLLAR GAS IN CALIFORNIA IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE DEPENDENT. ON OPEC AND DICTATORS. ALL ACROSS THE WORLD FROM SUPPLYING THIS USE AND NOTHING IN CALIFORNIA CAN SOLVE THAT SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE COULD SEE. THE FOREST. AND NOT JUST A FEW TREES HERE- AND MAKE- IN INVOLVED DECISION ABOUT WHAT WE DO- IN OUR WITH OUR NATURAL RESOURCES HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THAT MEASURE SIX VOTES WILL EVEN CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS NEXT UP WE HAVE FILE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT SB ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN FROM SENATOR ALAN YOU CAN BE PRESENT AT YOUR CONVENIENCE. THANK YOU IS YOUR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO FIRST START BY THINKING DENNIS- YOUR GREAT STAFF HERE MISTER CHAIR- THAT. I WANNA- JUST THINK YOU KNOW. ALL THE WORK WE'VE DONE TOGETHER AS WE PREPARE FOR SOME EXCITING ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE TO COME IN THIS SPACE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT THE SECOND. SO THIS BILL IS A PLACEHOLDER BILL THAT WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT THE STATUTORY CHANGES NECESSARY TO SET CALIFORNIA ON ITS COURSE. TO MEET THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE- PARTICULARLY FOCUSING ON STRATEGIC LAND ACQUISITIONS. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN INTERESTED IN SINCE I. FIRST DECIDED TO RUN FOR THIS POSITION. I AS YOU KNOW THE THIRTY BY THIRTY MISCHIEF PLEDGES TO CONSERVE. 30% OF OUR STATE'S LANDS. AND COASTAL WATERS BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY ENSURING THE RICH BIODIVERSITY AND VITALITY F CALIFORNIA'S VAST FORESTS AND COASTLINES AND GRASSLANDS DESERT'S MORE. WE PROTECT IT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS TO ENJOY AND EXPLORE AND OF COURSE IT'S PART OF A GLOBAL PUSH. IN THIS SPACE I SAID THIS IS THE WEEK WHEN- CALIFORNIA WILL RELEASE THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PATHWAYS TO THIRTY BY THIRTY STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH WILL OUTLINE THE ACTIONS THAT ARE STATE AGENCIES AND THEIR PARTNERS WILL TAKE TO IMPLEMENT OUR AMBITIOUS CONSERVATION GOALS ALONGSIDE INNOVATIVE MEASURES TO. BUILD CLIMATE RESILIENCY. SO STATE PARKS HAS AN ESTABLISHED PROCEDURE FOR ACQUIRING NEW LAND PARCELS FOR CONSERVATION RECREATION- BUT- PROGRAM DELAYS HAVE RESULTED IN MISSED OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH PRIORITY ACQUISITIONS IN AN OVERALL TREND OF GROWTH GROWTH STAGNATION. WITH THE LAST SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION BE MADE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN QUITE FRANKLY MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO EACH OF YOU ABOUT HOW WE CAN. REINVIGORATE PARKS I THINK THEY'VE NEVER QUITE RECOVERED FROM- THE SCANDAL THEY DEALT WITH WHEN I FIRST CAME INTO THE LEGISLATURE OVER- HOARDING FINDS. I YOU KNOW- AND THEY'VE NEVER EITHER THIS IS AN AGENCY THAT PROVIDES INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OUR POPULATION- PEOPLE USING THE PARKS MORE THAN EVER NOW THAN EVER BEFORE THEY'RE THEY'RE SO OVER UTILIZED- AND YET- I SEE THAT A LACK OF AMBITION OVER THERE WHEN IT COMES TO. BUDGET REQUEST STICKING UP FOR THEMSELVES ASKING FOR WHAT THEY NEED AND A NEW LAND ACQUISITIONS SUCH THAT WORK. YOU KNOW THIS DO LEGISLATURE USED TO BUY PARK LAND ALL THE TIME. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN HAPPEN SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE. I AND WE'VE BEEN RUNNING EVERYTHING THROUGH THE CONSERVANCY'S WHICH IS A GOOD THING BUT- BUT OUR STATE PARKS REALLY. OUGHT TO BE PLAYING A ROLE IN THE SPACE TO AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE HISTORICALLY. I AND SO YOU KNOW IF CALIFORNIA IS TO ACCOMPLISH ITS CONSERVATION RESTORATION GOALS IN JUST EIGHT MORE YEARS AS- AS THE TWENTY THIRTY. DEADLINE APPROACHES THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO BE REPAIRED TO HELP ENHANCE THE ACQUISITION TOOLS. AVAILABLE TO STATE PARKS AND ENTITIES LIKE IT TO AND ALSO I THINK WE NEED TO HELP OUR INSTITUTIONS OUR STATE AGENCIES TO. KEEP PACE WITH THE EXPANSIONS ON THE HORIZON SO. THIS BILL WILL SERVE AS A VEHICLE TO IDENTIFY THE STATUTORY HURDLES AND STATE PARKS AND OTHERS EXPERIENCE IN ACQUIRING NEW PROPERTIES AND ENACT RECOMMENDATIONS. HIGHLIGHTED BY THE PATHWAYS A THIRTY BY THIRTY STRATEGIC PLAN THAT. IS GOING TO BE IS ABOUT TO BE ANNOUNCED. AS THE STEWARDS OF MANY OF CALIFORNIANS- PARKLANDS AND PROTECTED HABITATS ENTITIES LIKE STATE PARKS AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD. MUST BE WELL EQUIPPED TO QUICKLY MOBILIZE AND PREPARE FOR THE GROWING JURISDICTIONS. CALIFORNIA'S LEADING THE NATION IN ITS EFFORTS TO FORTIFY AND PRESERVE. BUT ON A TO RESOURCES. I WITH THIS BILL WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS A STRONG PARTNER IN ACHIEVING OUR THIRTY BY THIRTY CALLS ON BEHALF OF GENERATIONS. OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WILL COME AFTER US AND BENEFIT FROM. THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE NOW IS WE SET ASIDE MORE PARK LAND. MORE LAND FOR THEM TO ENJOY IT FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT TO GROW AND THRIVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND- RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS IN THE- EVOLVING SPACE WITH. A LOT OF. LEADERSHIP COMING NOT JUST FROM THE GOVERNOR BUT- BUT ALSO THE PRESENT UNITED STATES WITH THE RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT- FOR SIGNIFICANT FUNDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ON THIS FRONT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE. THIS VEHICLE MOVING AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON INFECTED LIKE TO. SIGN ON ONCE WE DO DEVELOPMENTS IN JOINTLY YOUR PRINCIPAL SOME WAY BE A PART OF THIS WITH YOU- APPRECIATE YOU GET AHEAD OF IT I THINK STATE ARKS IS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY WE DON'T HAVE ANY LEAD TO PORT WITNESSES SEEING THAT. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SO. IF THERE'S ANYONE WAS TESTIFYING GENERAL SUPPORT HERE. YOU'RE WELCOME AT THIS TIME BUT SEEING NINE. MODERATOR CAN YOU TURN THE PHONE LINES. ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE A MOMENT AND- WELCOME TO OR COMMENT IN SUPPORT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO I COMMAND AGAIN ONE ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME VERY GOOD- ANYONE IN THE HEARING WAS TESTIFYING OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. SEEING NINE HERE TURMERIC ETERNAL LINES ANYONE WISHING TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE. FOUR COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION WITH. THE EURO THAT COMMAND AGAIN OF ONE THEN ZERO. AND WE HAVE NO COMMENT AT THIS TIME OKAY VERY GO BRING BACK TO DYSON EARLIER. HE IT I'M GONNA MOVE THE BILL IN A IN A MOMENT BUT I'D LIKE TO GIVEN THE OPENING STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO OFFER SOME COMMENTS BECAUSE- THIS LEGISLATURE THROUGH DIFFERENT BONDS. ASCERTAINED BECAUSE MOST OF THE SPENDING ON PARKS ACQUISITION WAS GOING TO RURAL AREAS AND URBAN AREAS WERE BIG TO COLLECTED THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON PARKS AND THEY'VE BEEN GUIDED TO URBAN AREAS WHETHER IT'S FORMER RAIL LINES WHETHER IT'S FORMER RIVERS. ARE I MEAN FORMERLY NOT DEVELOPED RIVERLANDS LIKE AROUND THE L. A. RIVER AND OTHER PLACES AND SO THERE'S BEEN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUT- LEGISLATURE. IN THE VARIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS REALLY DECIDED IT SHOULD BE GUIDED TO LOCAL PARKS AND- DISPROPORTIONATE NEGLECTED URBAN AREAS SHOULD ACTUALLY BE DONE. IN THEIR WORST SIGNIFICANT REFORMS BUT ONE OF THE GREATEST ONCE CAME FROM THE LEGISLATURE IN CONCERT WITH THE ADMINISTRATION A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR CASH. INFUSION THROUGH THE OTHER TRANSPORTATION BONDWHICH WAS THE LARGEST CASH IN FEW CONFUSION TO PARKS IN A GENERATION AND THAT HAS LED TO FILLING POSITIONS IT IS LEAD TO MORE PLANTS IT HAS LED TO THE- TO THE- SETTING UP THE DIFFERENT ACQUISITIONS IN ADDITION TO JUST- YOU COULDN'T PAY. BOB BY CREDIT CARD OR PLASTIC AT ANY PARK IT THAT'S UP TO OVER A HUNDRED YOU COULDN'T BE PROMOTED INTO LEADERSHIP AND LOST YOUR BATCH LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH WAS REALLY DISADVANTAGING WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AT THAT WAS DRAMATICALLY CHANGED. ARM DOES LEGISLATURE DIDN'T ALLOW FOR LOCAL PARTNERS FOR PARKS THEY HAD TO BE AUTHORIZED AND THERE WAS A BILL THAT REALLY ALLOWED- MANY MORE AND THE- STATE PARKS DIDN'T EVEN ACCOUNT TO BUY INDIVIDUAL PARK IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW TO HELP AN INDIVIDUAL PARK YOU COULDN'T DO IT. THEY KEPT BY REGION SO THERE WERE MASSIVE REFORMS THAT WERE MADE. AFTER THAT THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. AND I THINK. I'M WAY MEETING AS THE AUTHOR IS WITH SOME BAY BREATH BECAUSE- THE THIRTY BY THIRTY HAS BEEN A VAGUE THING US FOR. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS VAGUE THE FIRST REPORT WAS VAGUE THERE THERE WERE NOT SPECIFICS AND I KNOW I OFFERED TO THE ADMINISTRATION A LADDER WITH EVERY SPECIFIC PROJECT I THINK THAT WOULD EXIST IN MY SENATE DISTRICT THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. THAT INCLUDES FOURTEEN THOUSAND ACRES OF LAND BY THE DIABLO CANYON NUCLEAR PLANT AND MANY PLACES WHERE WHERE THIS IS AVAILABLE SO I REALLY I LOOK FORWARD TO. TO SUPPORTING THIS BILL BECAUSE I LOOK FORWARD TO THEM GIVING US SOME SPECIFICITY THAT WE CAN MOVE ON BOTH BUDGETARY EARLY AND WITH THE GUTS OF YOUR BILL WHICH WILL COME IN AND IN THAT SPIRIT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU OKAY THAT'S A MOTOR CENTER LITTLETON CENTER HERTZBERG. I CAN'T BELIEVE SENATOR LISTENING. TO THE CBO. THANK YOU. I CAN'T PERCENT AROUND SIT NEXT TO THE FORMER SECRETARY OF RESOURCES. M. ALMOST THE ENTIRE TIME YOU SERVE IN GOVERNMENT HE WAS THE SECRETARY ADMINISTRATION TELLING ME HE DID NOTHING WHEN HE WAS THERE AND THE JOB. IS PRETTY GUTSY OF YOU BUT THAT'S WHAT HE DID A GREAT JOB IN. BRINGING IT BACK AND I GOT TO TELL YOU THERE'S BEEN A BUNCH OF OTHER ENDEAVORS WITH RESPECT TO PARK AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AND WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE WE SPENT TIME WITH JORDAN INSTANT THE IF THE- AT THE CONSERVANCY IS THAT. WE'VE SPENT TONS OF MONEY ON PARKS THERE. VIA GO SECURELY ACT IN OTHERS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A PER MONEY. SO THEY GIVE TRAFFIC TICKETS OUT AT VERY EXPENSIVE RATES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE OPERATIONAL MONEY. AND SO THE WHAT THE GENIUS OF WHAT OUR SENDER SECRETARY LATER TALKED ABOUT HIS THEY WERE BASICALLY WHAT WAS GOING ON INTERNALLY IT WASN'T SO MUCH BECAUSE OF RUTH AND WHAT HAPPENS DEPARTMENT. BUT THEY WERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY COULD STILL CREATE. LEVELS OF PARKS PARTICULARLY IN CITIES WHERE AS THE CHAIR PRESENTED THE OTHER DAY YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT BECAUSE- BECAUSE YOU HAD- WHAT WAS A QUICK QUIMBY FUNDS. AND QUIMBY FUNDS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY PRODUCE LIKE YOU KNOW A THOUSAND ACRES OF PARK VERSUS WHAT WAS HAPPENING EAST LOS ANGELES WHERE THEY HAD AN ACRE PARKS BECAUSE OF THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT THE CITY. AND QUIMBY FUNDS REQUIRED DEVELOPMENT CITIES OR WILL DISAPPEAR DESPARD PROBLEMS AND SO WHAT SENT BUT WITH SECRETARY LAIRD WAS ELEGANTLY DOING IN QUITE BRILLIANTLY TOGETHER IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE DURING THOSE YEARS. WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD CREATE MORE INNER CITY PARKS AND TRANSFER THE OPERATIONAL EXPENSES TO. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LARGER DYNAMIC. IN IN WHAT'S GOING ON LOOK IT'S IMPORTANT I AGREE AND SUPPORT YOUR BILL I LIKE IT A LOT. IS WHEN HE WILL DELIVER HIS CONTEXT THERE AND DEFEND OUR COLLEAGUE FOR HIS EXTRAORDINARY WORK. BECAUSE HE DID A FANTASTIC JOB. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG- ALLOW YOU TO REACT IN YOUR CLOTHES- DO WE HAVE TO- THE ANY MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS A WEEK WE'RE GOOD THERE THE ONLY LAST THING I JUST SEE PRELOAD TO ACTION THAT DOESN'T DOESN'T EVEN DEPEND ON THE ADMINISTRATION- IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS WHICH WILL RUN IN PARALLEL TO THIS MEASURE WE'RE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE PUTTING FORWARD THE SENATE'S PLAN ON BIODIVERSITY- ON NATURAL WORKING LANDS- AND LOOKING TO POTENTIALLY BUILD AND EXPAND ON THE MULTI BENEFIT NATURE BASED SOLUTIONS. A PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SO I THINK THERE WILL BE A IMPORTANT INTERPLAY THERE AS WELL WITH FLEXIBLE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT CAN GET TO OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AS WELL AS WELL EXISTENCE FROM I'M EXCITED THAT WE'RE TAKING SOME OWNERSHIP HERE. AND I'LL BE SUPPORT MEASURE ANALYZE A QUOTE I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT A GREAT DEAL AND I AND I DO WANT TO- ECHO MY COLLEAGUES- PRAISE AND LOVE FOR OUR FORMER SECRETARY IN OUR COLLEAGUE HERE- AND JUST TO CLARIFY THAT MY- I. AGREE THAT THAT THE FOCUS ON LOCAL URBAN PARKS IS IMPORTANT AND IT IS IT CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT. I ALSO THINK. THAT OUR EXISTING PARK INFRASTRUCTURE. I NEED A LOT MORE TLC I THINK THE MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS OUR OUR OUR OUR CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM I'VE I AM AN AVID. VISITOR OF OUR STATE PARKS AND I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE SAD WHEN THEY- WHEN THEY LACK BASIC AMENITIES- WHEN THE VIDEOS IN THE VISITOR CENTER FROM THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES- WHEN. I YOU KNOW WHAT WHEN IT WHEN IT WHEN I SEE HOW MUCH NEED THERE IS HOW MUCH USED AREAS INCLUDING FROM URBAN COMMUNITIES LET ME JUST STATE. AS GREAT AS URBAN PARKS ARE PEOPLE STILL WANT TO GET OUT OF THE CITY INTO WILDERNESS. AND THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF OUR STATE PARKS HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY IN MY OWN LIFETIME IMAGES TO SEE I'VE BEEN HIKING CINEMA COMMANDS FOR EXAMPLE SINCE I WAS LITTLE KID. IN TO SEE. THE AMOUNT OF UUSINTA PANDA STATE PARK FOR EXAMPLE OVER YOU SINCE I WAS A LITTLE KID TO NOW. AND THE. FROM LOS ANGELES ARE GOING UP IN THE STATE PARKS BRINGING FAMILIES. BRING DIVERSITY TO OUR STATE PARKS- IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ALSO BE TAKING YOUR ACCOUNT AS WE ALSO PUSH FOR URBAN PARK LAND. AND SO THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT AIM BY THE WAY. I'M A LOT OF THAT WILDLAND. THERE IS A RACE AGAINST DEVELOPMENT LANDING IN AND AROUND OUR URBAN AREAS THE WILDERNESS LAND THAT'S NEAR OUR URBAN AREAS IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES. ARE GET IS GETTING INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE. I THINK A LOT OF TIMES STATE PARK JUST KIND OF HOLD WITH RAISES HANDS IT SAYS THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN A FOR A FOR THIS. IT IT IT SAYS IT IS SILOS THEM DEEPER AND DEEPER INTO THIS WORLD APPROACH AS OPPOSED TO AN URBAN APPROACH. AND I JUST WNNA MAKE SURE WE'RE TAKING THAT WHATEVER BEARS WE CAN. TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO PURCHASE AND MAINTAIN. AND PROTECT AND PRESERVE- ALL TYPES OF PARKLAND INCLUDING I'M M. MY PERSONAL INTEREST IS REALLY DEEPLY IN. WILDERNESS AREAS ADJACENT URBAN AREA. ARE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S AN AREA WHERE THERE'S SO MUCH NEED- AND SO MUCH- A DEMAND WHEN IT COMES TO OUTDOOR RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR PUBLIC THAT DID THAT THE YES APPRECIATE THE URBAN PARKS BUT ALSO WANT A LITTLE TASTE OF WILDERNESS. THEY CAN DRIVE TO. GET BACK TO THEIR HOMES IN TIME FOR DINNER AND SO- ANYWAY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I CERTAINLY. WANT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH WITH THE SENATORS AND I AND I DO WANT TO APPLY TO THINK- MY COLLEAGUE FOR IT FOR ALL HIS HARD WORK IN THIS SPACE OVER HIS CAREER- WHICH REALLY HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY AND- APPRECIATE HIS MOTION AND- RESPECT FASHIONABLE. VERY GOOD THE MOTION IS. TO PASS THE- TO PASS THE FIRST RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CHIEF CONSULTANTS CALDERON FILE ITEM EIGHT S. B. ELEVEN SIXTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS STERN STERN ALRIGHT JONES ALAN HI ALAN ALL RIGHT EGGMAN. EGGMAN I GROWTH HERTZBERG AYE HERTZBERG AYE HUESO HUESO ARE A LAYERED LAYERED I LIVE. LIMÓN HI. VERY GOOD THAT MEASURE SEVEN VOTES WILL LEAVE IT ON CALL FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS- LAST ITEM UP HERE SB NINE I MEAN SORRY ITEM NINE SB TWELVE OH FIVE CENTER ALLEN. WITH THE MESSAGE CARE- ONCE AGAIN WE START BY THINKING DENNIS FOR HIS THOUGHTFUL WORK HE'S A- THESE ARE- ARE VERY ON TASMANIAN DEVIL IN A POSITIVE WAY- YEAH AND IT TELLS ME DANGER THERE YOU GO. I CAN HIT I'VE BEEN OF IT IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY I'M VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHICH I ACTUALLY THINK HELP THE BILL- QUITE A BIT I WISH WE THOUGHT OF SOME OF THE THINGS HE ADDED AND CHANGE IS ALREADYA SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTING MOST ASPECTS OF LIFE IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT DEVASTATING FIRES IN DESTRUCTIVE MUDSLIDES FLOODS. EXTREME HEAT EVENTS ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT WE TALK ABOUT QUITE A BIT IN THIS COMMITTEE. OF THE STATE'S WATERSHEDS OF COURSE HAVE NOT ESCAPED THE EFFECTS OF RISING TEMPERATURES AND CHANGING. PRECIPITATION PATTERNS. ART SO WHEN THE STATE'S WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD AND IS ASKED TO ISSUE A NEW PERMIT TO APPROPRIATE WATER BOARD'S PRACTICES BANNED TO ESTIMATE. THE STREAM FLOW. FROM EITHER HISTORICAL STREAM GAUGE RECORDS OR FROM MODELS THAT CONSIDER HISTORICAL DATA AND OTHER FACTORS. OPPERMAN APPLICANTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT TO THE STATE WATER BOARD QUOTE SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO DEMONSTRATE A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD THAT AN APPROPRIATE WATER IS AVAILABLE FOR THE PROPOSED APPROPRIATION. HOWEVER APPLICANTS ARE NOT GIVEN GUIDANCE OR STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN WATER SUPPLY. IN AVAILABILITY DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN FACT CLIMATE LAW- CALIFORNIA'S LAW IS SILENT ON THE ISSUE- AND NOT AS IN SPITE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE HAPPENING. I'M USING HISTORICAL DATA TO. I PREDICT WATER AVAILABILITY IS A GRAND MISTAKE CHANGING RAINFALL PATTERNS AND PROJECTIONS A DWINDLING SNOWPACK AND MADE ALL THE MORE URGENT THAT WE CONSIDER CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. ON CALIFORNIA'S HYDROLOGY BEFORE DETERMINING IF A RIVER STREAM HAS SUFFICIENT WATER TO ISSUE A NEW PERMIT. SO THIS BILL CALLS ON THE STATE WATER BOARD. TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS THAT ESTABLISH A METHODOLOGY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL HAVE ON WATERSHED RESOURCES THIS WILL ENSURE A MORE ACCURATE ASSESSMENT OF WATER AVAILABILITY IS CALIFORNIA FACES AN ERA. OF WARMER AND DRIER- AND CHANGING CONDITIONS AND HERE WITH ME TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ARE PROFESSOR JENNIFER HARDER FROM MCGEORGE. SCHOOL OF LAW RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND ALSO DR PETER GLICK WHOSE PRESIDENT EMERITUS OF THE PACIFIC INSTITUTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WOODARD DR WITH IS HARDER IN THE HEARING ROOM NOW WILL COME TO THE HEARING ROOM FIRST THEN OR SHE IS HERE IN THE AREA OF- WHO IT. HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE TO PROCEED. A PROFESSOR DR- SEPARADA DR GLICK WELCOME THANK YOU THE WITNESSES OF DISCUSSED AT ALL I'M VERY WELL PLEASE PROCESS SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TO PRESENT ORAL AND WRITTEN TESTIMONY SUBMITTED SOME WRITTEN TESTIMONY FOR YOU IN SUPPORT OF S. B. RO TWELVE OH FIVE I'M DOCTOR PETER GLICK COMMA CLIMATE AND WATER SCIENTIST WHILE WORKING FOR FOUR DECADES ON CALIFORNIA WATER AND CLIMATE ISSUES I'VE PREVIOUSLY SERVED ON THE PUBLIC ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE- ON THESE ISSUES FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE. TAKEN WITH VISOR COMMITTEE I'M A MEMBER OF THE U. S. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES I HAVE SERVED ON A RANGE OF COMMITTEESASSOCIATED WITH. THESE ISSUES. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROPOSED BILL IS VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE WHEN IT'S NEEDED. THAT IS TO GIVE THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE EXPLICIT ABILITY. TO CONSIDER THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE INCLUDING DROUGHTS EXTREME EVENTS LAND USE CHANGES GROUNDWATER SURFACE WATER INTERACTIONS. IN THEIR WORK TO DETERMINE WATER AVAILABILITY WHEN ISSUING AND ADMINISTERING WATER PERMITS AND WATER LICENSES. SUCH EVALUATIONS ARE LONG OVERDUE AND I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE JUST THREE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE BILL. THE FIRST IS THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL IT'S CAUSED BY HUMANS IT'S ALREADY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES AND IT'S NOT ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE WAY WE DEAL WITH THOSE WATER RESOURCES. TO OUR EXISTING WATER MANAGEMENT RULES AND INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE AND ADMINISTRATION OF WATER RIGHTS DO NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE IN PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT. AND THIRD THE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE LONG OVERDUE AND ALIGN WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN SOME FROM LITERALLY DECADES AGO FROM ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING WATER UTILITIES IN THE WATER MANAGEMENT COMMUNITY EACH OF THESE POINTS THESE THREE POINTS ARE EXPLAINED. IN MORE DETAIL IN MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY LET ME SIMPLY CLOSE WITH ONE QUOTE FROM MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS AGO. FROM THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE IN A BOOK CALLED CLIMATE CHANGE AND U. S. WATER RESOURCES THEY SAID QUOTE. GOVERNMENTS AT ALL LEVELS SHOULD REEVALUATE LEGAL TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC PROCEDURES FOR MANAGING WATER RESOURCES IN THE LIGHT OF CLIMATE CHANGES THAT ARE HIGHLY LIKELY END OF QUOTE. THIRTY TWO YEARS AGO. THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR GO AGAIN FOR YOUR WRITTEN TESTIMONY AS WELL- NOW WELCOME TRANSFER HERDER. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SB TWELVE OH FIVE. I'M JENNIFER HARDER A PROFESSOR AT MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHERE I TEACH WATER RESOURCES LAW. ADMINISTRATIVE LAW- PUBLISHER WATER LOCKED HIS BOOK. PREVIOUSLY I WAS AN ATTORNEY AND A PARTNER TO SACRAMENTO WATER LAW FIRM. I'M SPEAKING TO YOU AS A MEMBER OF A GROUP OF SEVEN LINE POLICY EXPERTS WHO RECENTLY DEVELOPED A SUITE OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO REFORM CALIFORNIA WATER LAW TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE RELEASED IN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. SB TWELVE OH FIVE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR UNANIMOUS RECOMMENDATIONSARE GROUPS RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH OF WHAT THE COMMITTEE HASTALKED ABOUT TODAY AND DOCTOR CLICKS TESTIMONY THAT CLIMATE CHANGE ISN'T IMMINENT CRISIS FOR ALL WATER USERS WHETHER THEY'RE WATER SUPPLIERS ARE LANDOWNERS OR BUSINESS. OR THE ENVIRONMENT. SO CONSISTENT WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION SB TWELVE OH FIVE WOULD PROVIDE THE STATE WATER BOARD WITH CLEAR DIRECTION AS TO LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY.

WHEN IT WAS ELEVEN FEET I WOULD DROP DOWN TO THE BOTTOM TOUCH OFF AND PUMP UP. I HAVE A BRAND NEW KAYAK BOAT ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT OUT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE SCRAPE ON THE ROCKS OF THE RIVER. I REMEMBER FONDLY WHEN MY FATHER WOULD COME HOME WITH SALMON HE CAUGHT IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND WE WOULD SMOKE MADE OUR BACKYARD. MY SON LOVE SMOKE SALMON THERE ARE NO SALMON IN THE RIVER. MY CHILDHOOD FRIENDS AND I USED TO FISH ALL THE TIME IN THE AMERICAN RIVER I'M WAITING FOR THEM TO COME BACK. IT'S NOT COMING BACK I UNDERSTAND IT'S VERY SAD. WHERE IS NO WATER AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM ALL THESE EXPERTS AND I. HOPE THAT YOU'RE LISTENING TO THEM.

I THINK I JUST WANNA MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THIS BILL LOOKING AT THE BILL AND- READING THAT SINCE THAT. UNDERSTANDING HOW CALIFORNIA MANAGES HIS% RESOURCES THIS IS A BIG BILL AND I JUST WANNA. THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING ON THIS ISSUE I'VE I'VE BEEN SERVING ON ON A COUPLE COMMITTEE BETWEEN MY SERVICE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE I'VE BEEN NOW THIS WOULD BE MY TWELVE YEAR SERVICE TWELVE YEARS SERVING ON. ON WATER RELATED COMMITTEES AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF WORK THAT WE'VE DONE DONE WITH GROUND WATER MANAGEMENT AND MANAGING OUR ATER SO MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS AND PASSING THE WATER BOND. AT YOU KNOW WATER PROJECTS ARE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BUILD. RESERVOIRS OR CONVEYANCE OR YOU KNOW- THAT. INJECT INTO GROUNDWATER ALL THAT IT'S VERY COSTLY. AND SO WE HAVE TO REALLY FIND- NEW CREATIVE WAYS TO MANAGE THE OF A VERY IMPORTANT RESOURCE. FOR OUR STATE HI WHEN I FLY HOME FROM SACRAMENTO I OFTEN SIT ON THE SIDE. FACING THE SIERRAS HAVE ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE THE SNOW PACK AND I WAS LIKE TO SEE THE LEVEL OF THE RESERVOIRS. ONE THING I I'VE NOTICED. IN MY RECENT MOST RECENT FLIGHTS DUE TO WILDFIRE. A LOT MORE OF THE SIERRA- DOESN'T REALLY HAVE TREES TO PROVIDE SHADE. THAT WILL PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME PROTECTION TO THE SNOW SLICK LAST LONGER IN THE YEAR. AND THERE ARE ENORMOUS SWATHS OF MOUNTAINSIDE THEY'RE NOT EXPOSED. AND WE CAN EXPECT THAT A LOT OF THAT THAT WATER IS GOING TO COME DOWN THE MOUNTAIN A LOT SOONER. THAN NORMAL AND OFTEN TIMES WHEN IT'S NOT NEEDED BAND AND ADVOCATE COULD BE POTENTIALLY LOST- TO- FIRST FOR THE BENEFITS OF AGRICULTURAL AND HUMAN USE AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO REALLY TAKE A- ANOTHER LOOK AT I HOPE. THAT THE- BUT THE WATER BOARD LEVEL WERE WERE WERE- WE'RE TAKING NOTE OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAVE I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD HAVE NEVER PREDICTED. A WHEN I GOT ELECTED TWELVE YEARS AGO WE COULD HAVE NEVER PREDICTED THAT WOULD HAPPEN AND SO- A BILL LIKE THIS IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME IN AND START TO MAKE VERY DIFFICULT DECISIONS. ABOUTHOW WE MANAGE WATER BECAUSE I MEAN WE USED TO HAVE SEVEN IN SAN DIEGO AND TIJUANA RIVER. AND TO SEE THAT IT'S NOT EVEN IT'S AT WHERE- I'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE AND I NEVER SAW IT BUT BEFORE I GOT ELECTED PEOPLE'S USED TO SAY THAT THE AMERICAN RIVER USED TO TURN RED. WITH ALL THE SALMON SWIMMING UPSTREAM. AND I NEVER GOT TO SEE THAT AND WE PROBABLY NEVER WILL AND THAT'S AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE WE'RE TRYING TO STILL. TRYING TO MANAGE THAT RESOURCE. IN A WAY- THAT TO ME IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S A LOSING BATTLE SO- THIS IS A BIG BILL AND I APPRECIATE WORKING ON AND I'M PLEASED TO SUPPORT AND BE LIKE TO BE A- CO AUTHOR FIFTY. FIVE FIVE KANSEN POINT. OKAY VERY GOOD- MANY OTHERS COMMENTS QUESTIONS- WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AS WELL.

AND CO AUTHORING HIS MEASURES WELL AND I'LL JUST SIMPLY SAY AS THE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY POINTS OUT THAT THE PAST WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A GOOD PREDICTOR OF THE FUTURE. SO WE LOOK TO OUR HISTORY FOR WHAT WATER CYCLES WILL LOOK LIKE WILL BE WOEFULLY DECEIVED- AT AN UNDER PLANNED AND LEFT BLIND SIDED SO WE HAVE TO LOOK TO NEW TOOLS- AND- NEW- NEW MODES OF ANALYSIS AS WELL AS NEW HARDWARE TO DO THE MEASUREMENT THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO GET A SENSE OF OUR HYDROLOGY AND REALLY MAKE. DECISIONS THAT SET US UP FOR SOME KIND OF SUSTAINABILITY IN THE LONG TERM- SO WITH THAT- THE MERGER THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED- THE FIRST AMEND AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.
