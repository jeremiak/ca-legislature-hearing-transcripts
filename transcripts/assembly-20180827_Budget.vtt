CLARIFICATION SHOULD BE MADE

RATHER THAN ABIDING BY THE

BY MAKING THIS CHANGE IT --

00:15:42.942 --> 00:15:46.379 region:rollup2

[inaudible]

00:15:57.256 --> 00:16:01.928 region:rollup2
THE IT'S RULING COULD BE APPLIED

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:02.929 region:rollup2
RETROACTIVELY AND I'M SURE THAT

00:16:01.928 --> 00:16:04.096 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING SOME

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:06.199 region:rollup2
KIND OF FEDERAL.

00:16:04.096 --> 00:16:07.400 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT SAID IN ESTABLISHING

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:08.768 region:rollup2
THAT SO I I DON'T THINK THAT WE

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.869 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY BUSINESS.

00:16:08.768 --> 00:16:11.370 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED ATTEMPTING TO

00:16:09.869 --> 00:16:12.538 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THAT AT THE STATE

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:13.139 region:rollup2
LEVEL I DON'T THINK THAT

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.973 region:rollup2
ANYTHING THAT WE DO HERE IS

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:15.541 region:rollup2
GOING TO STAND.

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:16.609 region:rollup2
OUT IN PARTICULARLY I DON'T FEEL

00:16:15.541 --> 00:16:18.244 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS HAS ANYTHING TO DO

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:19.946 region:rollup2
WITH THE BUDGET SO --

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:21.347 region:rollup2
THAT'S ANOTHER OBJECTION I HAVE

00:16:19.946 --> 00:16:21.948 region:rollup2
AS TO WHY IT'S BEING INCLUDED A

00:16:21.347 --> 00:16:23.416 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL COULD YOU ADDRESS

00:16:21.948 --> 00:16:24.784 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:26.786 region:rollup2
WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT IN TERMS

00:16:24.784 --> 00:16:28.120 region:rollup2
OF THE ABILITY OF THE CONTROLLER

00:16:26.786 --> 00:16:29.989 region:rollup2
TO MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS AND?

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.490 region:rollup2
IT WOULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.226 region:rollup2
FUTURE LIABILITY ON THIS WOULD

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.660 region:rollup2
APPLY TO ANY KEEP APPENDING OR

00:16:33.226 --> 00:16:35.695 region:rollup2
FUTURE CLAIMS.

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.763 region:rollup2
I WHICH WOULD.

00:16:35.695 --> 00:16:39.532 region:rollup2
TIE BACK TO POTENTIAL YET COSTS

00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:41.200 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE DEPARTMENTS.

00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:42.568 region:rollup2
OKAY THAT THAT'S TENUOUS TO ME

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.803 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION WE

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:45.605 region:rollup2
ALWAYS USED TO TIE SOMETHING

00:16:43.803 --> 00:16:47.039 region:rollup2
THAT'S POLICY INTO THE BUDGET.

00:16:45.605 --> 00:16:48.241 region:rollup2

A NUMBER OF INCREASES FOR PAY

00:18:43.356 --> 00:18:46.626 region:rollup2

00:18:46.626 --> 00:18:49.328 region:rollup2
THAT SO.

00:18:47.693 --> 00:18:50.296 region:rollup2
IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:51.831 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THOSE

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:52.398 region:rollup2
BARGAINING UNITS AND I WAS

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:54.667 region:rollup2
LOOKING ON YOUR WEBSITE LAST

00:18:52.398 --> 00:18:56.969 region:rollup2
NIGHT. TO SEE IF I'D MISSED

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:59.171 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND I WAS LOOKING AT

00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.239 region:rollup2
THE TO PUT DEAL LAUGHS ESTIMATE

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:01.440 region:rollup2
FOR THE INFLATION RATE IN

00:19:00.239 --> 00:19:02.775 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WHICH ALTHOUGH IT'S

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.377 region:rollup2
BEEN TAKING UP RECENTLY IS STILL

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:05.745 region:rollup2
WELL UNDER 4%.

00:19:04.377 --> 00:19:07.446 region:rollup2
SO I'M WONDERING HOW YOU FEEL

00:19:05.745 --> 00:19:08.748 region:rollup2
LIKE THESE.

00:19:07.446 --> 00:19:09.649 region:rollup2
THESE INCREASES ARE JUSTIFIED

00:19:08.748 --> 00:19:12.685 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S ALARMING TO ME I

00:19:09.649 --> 00:19:13.452 region:rollup2
MEAN CLEARLY IF WE I CONTINUALLY

00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:14.820 region:rollup2
TO IT TO CONTINUE TO GRANT

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:15.955 region:rollup2
SALARY INCREASES.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:19.692 region:rollup2
IN EXCESS OF THE RATE OF

00:19:15.955 --> 00:19:20.559 region:rollup2
INFLATION TO OUR EMPLOYEES --

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:21.961 region:rollup2
WE WOULD RUN OUT OF MONEY VERY

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:23.029 region:rollup2
QUICKLY STE IT'S CLEARLY NOT A

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:25.031 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABLE ACTION FOR YOU TO

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:26.032 region:rollup2
TAKE SO HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THOSE

00:19:25.031 --> 00:19:28.200 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF INCREASE FOR THOSE TWO

00:19:26.032 --> 00:19:29.168 region:rollup2
BARGAINING UNITS.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.236 region:rollup2
AND WHAT I WOULD SAY TO THAT IS

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:31.937 region:rollup2
THAT -- YOU

00:19:30.236 --> 00:19:33.305 region:rollup2
THESE ARE BOTH AGREEMENTS ARE

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:34.373 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATIONS

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:35.574 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THE STATE.

00:19:34.373 --> 00:19:36.976 region:rollup2
NAM AND THE UNION ON THESE

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:37.977 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS ARE YOU ARE CORRECT

00:19:36.976 --> 00:19:40.146 region:rollup2
THAT THEY DO INCLUDE OTHER

00:19:37.977 --> 00:19:40.646 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OUTSIDE OF JUST THE

00:19:40.146 --> 00:19:41.447 region:rollup2
STANDARD GENERAL SALARY

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:43.049 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

00:19:41.447 --> 00:19:45.217 region:rollup2
I WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE FAIR

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:46.519 region:rollup2
DEALS ON GIVEN SALARY SURVEYS

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:47.119 region:rollup2
THAT WERE DONE.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:49.722 region:rollup2
TO ESSENTIALLY KEEP THE STATE

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:51.891 region:rollup2
ONLINE WITH.

00:19:49.722 --> 00:19:53.626 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS --

00:19:51.891 --> 00:19:55.594 region:rollup2
SO I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT THE

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:56.095 region:rollup2
OVERALL STRUCTURE OF THESE DEALS

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:58.264 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE OF THE PAID

00:19:56.095 --> 00:19:59.565 region:rollup2
CONTRACT.

00:19:58.264 --> 00:20:01.267 region:rollup2
ON THE TWO YEAR BUDGETARY COSTS

00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:02.435 region:rollup2
ON THIS TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:03.703 region:rollup2
THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION HOW

00:20:02.435 --> 00:20:04.904 region:rollup2
MAY POINT FOUR MILLION WHICH IS

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:08.007 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND.

00:20:04.904 --> 00:20:09.875 region:rollup2
THE CONTRACT WITH THE SCIENTISTS

00:20:08.007 --> 00:20:11.510 region:rollup2
THAT IS A THREE YEAR THERE HAS A

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.411 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR BUDGETARY COSTS OF

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:13.245 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIXTY THREE AND A HALF

00:20:12.411 --> 00:20:14.947 region:rollup2
MILLION.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:15.881 region:rollup2
OF WHICH TWELVE POINT ONE

00:20:14.947 --> 00:20:17.383 region:rollup2
MILLION IS GENERAL FUND --

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:18.884 region:rollup2
BUT JUST TO REITERATE ME OF

00:20:17.383 --> 00:20:20.086 region:rollup2
THESE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.454 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE.

00:20:20.086 --> 00:20:23.289 region:rollup2
TOM AND THE UNIONS AND WE

00:20:21.454 --> 00:20:24.724 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THESE ARE FAIR

00:20:23.289 --> 00:20:26.826 region:rollup2
DEALS ON PRESENTED BEFORE YOU.

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:29.028 region:rollup2
OKAY SO AMEND THE QUESTION WAS.

00:20:26.826 --> 00:20:30.796 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY?

00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:31.731 region:rollup2
WHY THAT THOSE ARE FAIR GIVEN

00:20:30.796 --> 00:20:33.466 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT INFLATION IS

00:20:31.731 --> 00:20:34.834 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY LESS?

00:20:33.466 --> 00:20:36.102 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:37.069 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN THE ANSWER YOU GAVE

00:20:36.102 --> 00:20:38.370 region:rollup2
ME WAS WELL THAT'S WHAT WE

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:39.672 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED WHICH IS NOT WHAT I

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:40.439 region:rollup2
WAS ASKING WAS ASKING.

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:41.607 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.942 region:rollup2
JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT BEING A

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:44.510 region:rollup2
FAIR DEAL.

00:20:42.942 --> 00:20:45.811 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SAY THAT SOME IN

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.681 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO BEING SUBJECT TO

00:20:45.811 --> 00:20:50.516 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS HOW WE DO LOOK AT

00:20:48.681 --> 00:20:51.350 region:rollup2
SELLERS SERVICE EVER DONE TO

00:20:50.516 --> 00:20:52.618 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:54.520 region:rollup2
ON KEEP THE STATE SALARIES IN

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:56.088 region:rollup2
LINE WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.090 region:rollup2
THEIR PEERS COME IN.

00:20:56.088 --> 00:21:00.092 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.761 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.895 region:rollup2
OKAY I DONE UNFORTUNATELY I

00:21:01.761 --> 00:21:05.264 region:rollup2
DON'T FIND THAT ANSWER

00:21:02.895 --> 00:21:05.998 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY BUT NORMALLY I IN

00:21:05.264 --> 00:21:07.366 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.501 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT I'VE

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.535 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED THEM OR USE THAT.

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:11.971 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD WITH OTHER BARGAINING

00:21:09.535 --> 00:21:13.272 region:rollup2
UNITS WHEN I THINK THAT THERE

00:21:11.971 --> 00:21:13.939 region:rollup2
FISCALLY PRUDENT IN THE BEST

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.241 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF THE STATE I

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:16.208 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY AM INTERESTED IN

00:21:15.241 --> 00:21:17.276 region:rollup2
COMPENSATING.

00:21:16.208 --> 00:21:18.511 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR STATE EMPLOYEES

00:21:17.276 --> 00:21:20.579 region:rollup2
FAIRLY BRITISH JUST DOESN'T

00:21:18.511 --> 00:21:23.883 region:rollup2
DOESN'T SEEM PRUDENT TO APPROVE

00:21:20.579 --> 00:21:25.918 region:rollup2
THIS LEVEL FISCAL INCREASE.

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:27.453 region:rollup2
I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT I THINK

00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:28.954 region:rollup2
YOUR POINT ABOUT INFLATION'S

00:21:27.453 --> 00:21:30.389 region:rollup2
VERY THERE WILL TAKE AND I WOULD

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:33.859 region:rollup2
SAY I KNOW THAT.

00:21:30.389 --> 00:21:34.860 region:rollup2
THE BAY AREA WE HAVE VERY MUCH

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:36.462 region:rollup2
RECRUITING AND RETAINING STATE

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:38.097 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:39.698 region:rollup2
SIMPLY BECAUSE FRANKLY ALTHOUGH

00:21:38.097 --> 00:21:41.233 region:rollup2
I COUNTIES IN MANY OF THE CITY'S

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:43.102 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PAY MORE SO THAT

00:21:41.233 --> 00:21:44.470 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT

00:21:43.102 --> 00:21:45.838 region:rollup2
WOULD BE IN ONE OF THE FACTORS

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:46.539 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WAS

00:21:45.838 --> 00:21:47.840 region:rollup2
TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.

00:21:46.539 --> 00:21:49.542 region:rollup2
CHURCH AT NIGHT COMPLETELY

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.910 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT MISTER CHAIR AND

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:52.845 region:rollup2
I'VE DEALT WITH THIS IN THE

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.146 region:rollup2
PRIVATE SECTOR AS WELL --

00:21:52.845 --> 00:21:56.048 region:rollup2
HOWEVER LAWMAKER POINT THAT YOU

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:57.283 region:rollup2
NEVER CAN ASSUME THAT PAY

00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:58.517 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTIAL IS THE REASON WHY

00:21:57.283 --> 00:21:59.852 region:rollup2
YOU'RE HAVING TROUBLE OF

00:21:58.517 --> 00:22:01.287 region:rollup2
RETAINING EMPLOYEES.

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:02.388 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU SUSPECT THAT THAT'S

00:22:01.287 --> 00:22:04.657 region:rollup2
THE CASE THEN WHAT YOU NEED TO

00:22:02.388 --> 00:22:06.125 region:rollup2
DO IS TO DO A STUDY IN WHICH TO

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.026 region:rollup2
YOU INTERVIEW DON'T EXERT OUR

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:07.459 region:rollup2
VIEW WITH EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:09.361 region:rollup2
LEAVING.

00:22:07.459 --> 00:22:10.462 region:rollup2
AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHY

AND SAID WE COULD SEE WHAT WAS

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:30.569 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN AT THE DMV.

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:31.603 region:rollup2
AND SPECIFICALLY THE AUDIT WOULD

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:32.871 region:rollup2
HAVE DETERMINE THE AVERAGE WAIT

00:24:31.603 --> 00:24:35.007 region:rollup2
TIMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AND

00:24:32.871 --> 00:24:36.041 region:rollup2
WITHOUT APPOINTMENTS.

00:24:35.007 --> 00:24:38.043 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE IDENTIFIED THE

00:24:36.041 --> 00:24:39.244 region:rollup2
STEPS DMB HAS TAKEN TO REDUCE

00:24:38.043 --> 00:24:40.879 region:rollup2
WAIT TIMES IN INCREASE

00:24:39.244 --> 00:24:42.314 region:rollup2
APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY BUT

00:24:40.879 --> 00:24:43.615 region:rollup2
ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER WAIT

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:45.451 region:rollup2
TIMES HAVE INCREASED SINCE THE

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:47.152 region:rollup2

00:24:48.721 --> 00:24:51.623 region:rollup2
WHAT ALSO DETERMINE WHETHER THE

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.925 region:rollup2
DME IS ON TRACK TO MEET A TIRING

00:24:51.623 --> 00:24:54.493 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS AND WHETHER

00:24:52.925 --> 00:24:55.594 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES ARE ADEQUATELY TRAINED

00:24:54.493 --> 00:24:57.796 region:rollup2
AMONG OTHER THINGS?

COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT OF THE DIEM

00:25:12.077 --> 00:25:15.647 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE APPROVED. SIXTEEN

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:17.282 region:rollup2
POINT SIX MILLION AND TWO

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:19.118 region:rollup2
HUNDRED THIRTY POSITIONS TO

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:21.086 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE ISSUES --

00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:23.055 region:rollup2
AT WHICH IN MY MIND IS GIVING

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:24.656 region:rollup2
THE DMB A BLANK CHECK WITHOUT

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:26.325 region:rollup2
ANY RESTRICTIONS OR STRINGS AND

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.359 region:rollup2
I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS.

00:25:26.325 --> 00:25:28.527 region:rollup2
IN THIS ROOM AND EVEN THOSE WHO

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:29.928 region:rollup2
ARE AT THIS IN THIS COMMITTEE

00:25:28.527 --> 00:25:32.097 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE A VERY

00:25:29.928 --> 00:25:33.499 region:rollup2
SERIOUS PROBLEM.

00:25:32.097 --> 00:25:35.000 region:rollup2
AT THE DMV AND I DON'T.

00:25:33.499 --> 00:25:36.135 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT EVERYBODY UNDERSTAND

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.870 region:rollup2
I DON'T BLAME.

00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:39.371 region:rollup2
DMB EMPLOYEES I DON'T THINK THEY

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.506 region:rollup2
CREATED THE PROBLEM I THINK

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:42.374 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE

00:25:40.506 --> 00:25:44.243 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS DONE TO CREATE

00:25:42.374 --> 00:25:45.878 region:rollup2
THOSE PROBLEMS --

00:25:44.243 --> 00:25:48.914 region:rollup2
I KNOW THE DMB EMPLOYEES THAT

00:25:45.878 --> 00:25:50.616 region:rollup2
I'VE SPOKEN WITH IN FACT THE ONE

00:25:48.914 --> 00:25:51.884 region:rollup2
I WOMAN WE SPOKE WITH.

00:25:50.616 --> 00:25:53.052 region:rollup2
WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS GETTING HER

00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:54.553 region:rollup2
TO PERMIT HER DRIVER'S LICENSE

00:25:53.052 --> 00:25:57.723 region:rollup2
SHE SAID?

00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:58.123 region:rollup2
SHE USED TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT

00:25:57.723 --> 00:25:59.291 region:rollup2
ABOUT --

00:25:58.123 --> 00:26:01.960 region:rollup2
COMPLETE ABOUT.

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:03.195 region:rollup2
FOURTY TRANSACTIONS A DAY BUT

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:06.865 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE THAT

00:26:03.195 --> 00:26:07.533 region:rollup2
REMAIN SHE'S NOW DOWN THE TWENTY

00:26:06.865 --> 00:26:08.467 region:rollup2
FIVE SO I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO

00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:09.802 region:rollup2
MISUNDERSTAND THAT SOMEHOW I

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:11.203 region:rollup2
THINK DMB EMPLOYEES ARE

00:26:09.802 --> 00:26:13.005 region:rollup2
SABOTAGING THE PUBLIC I DON'T

00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:13.572 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S THE CASE.

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:15.474 region:rollup2
I JUST THINK THAT THEY DON'T

00:26:13.572 --> 00:26:16.875 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:26:15.474 --> 00:26:18.577 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE NOR DO WE

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.678 region:rollup2
SO HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY EXPECT

00:26:18.577 --> 00:26:21.213 region:rollup2
THEM TO FIX IT?

00:26:19.678 --> 00:26:22.414 region:rollup2
AND JUST GIVING THEM MORE MONEY

00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:23.182 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.516 region:rollup2
SOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT

00:26:23.182 --> 00:26:26.852 region:rollup2
MONEY ISN'T THE ISSUE I THINK

00:26:24.516 --> 00:26:28.287 region:rollup2
IT'S THE PROCESS --

00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:29.988 region:rollup2
SO AN AUDIT WOULD HAVE TOLD US

00:26:28.287 --> 00:26:31.323 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHERE THE PROBLEM IS BUT

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:32.658 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:34.126 region:rollup2
AND WE DIDN'T GET THAT AUDIT I'M

00:26:32.658 --> 00:26:35.694 region:rollup2
DISAPPOINTED BUT I DO LOOK

00:26:34.126 --> 00:26:36.929 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH MY

00:26:35.694 --> 00:26:38.397 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF WE CAN

00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:40.232 region:rollup2

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:41.500 region:rollup2
I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE TIME.

00:26:40.232 --> 00:26:41.767 region:rollup2
