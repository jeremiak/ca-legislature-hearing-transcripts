THE PERFECT DATA BREACH WHICH EXPOSE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE DUE TO LAX CYBER SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE. CREDIT FREEZES ARE THE ONLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION TO SAFEGUARD THE CREDIT OF OUR CHILDREN AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CALIFORNIA FAMILY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY A PREMIUM TO PROTECT UP TO BE PROTECTED FROM THE MISUSE.

BILLS COMING FORWARD IN RESPONSE TO THE BREACH BUT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY A PHRASE ONLY FOR CHILDREN IN THIS FOLLOWS UP ON A BILL THAT WAS DONE. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT ALLOW PARENTS TO FREEZE THEIR. CHILDREN SOCIAL SECURITY OR THEIR THEIR CREDIT REPORT SO. OF IT IS IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT SET UP PROCESS THAT OF PARENTS SHOULD MAKE SURE TO UTILIZE WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN TO PROTECT THEIR CREDIT BECAUSE. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT SOME OF?

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IS GREAT TO SEE YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX TO TODAY. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX IS A SIMPLE YET IMPORTANT MEASURE TO HELP CLARIFY HOW AND WHEN DEBT MAY BE PERCEIVED FOR REPAYMENT. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAS EXPIRED. IT WOULD DO THIS IN THREE WAYS FIRST PROVIDED NO PERSON MAY SEWER BRING LEGAL ACTION AGAINST CONSUMER WHEN THE DEBT BECOMES TIME BARRED. MEANNESS TOUCH LIMITATIONS HAS PASSED SECOND IT WAS STATE THAT IT REPAYMENT OF THE DEBT BEGINS AFTER HIS TIME BARRED US TAX LIMITATIONS CLOCK DOES NOT RESTART. THIRD IT WOULD PROVIDE ANY PERSON ATTEMPTING TO COLLECT ON THE TIME BY DEBT TO PRINT. BY CONSUMERS OF INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT A TIME BY DEBT IS. A AND THAT THEY CANNOT BE SUED. SUPPORT NOTE THAT. BOB ARTISTS OTHERS INCLUDE HER BY SAYING I AM THIS BILL PROVIDES. PROTECTIONS CONSUMERS ARE DEBT BECOMES TIME BARRED EIGHTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX IS PRAGMATIC AND LOGICAL NEXT AND HELPING PREVENT CONSUMERS ARE BEING TARGETED. ENSUED FOR DESTINY TOO OLD TO LEGALLY ENFORCE. ME TODAY A IS JAN FLOREY VOIGTS CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY SO IS RON COLEMAN. ADVERTISEMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON GENTLER THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WERE CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST AND OLDEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER MEANING THAT WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH OUR LOCAL LEGAL SERVICES PARTNERS. AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX HAS A COUPLE OF IT IMPORTANT PROVISIONS FIRST OF ALL RIGHT NOW IF IT DEBT BUYER HOLDS YOUR DAD. YOU GET A NOTICE OF ITS AFTER THE FOR YOUR STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OR ITS AFTER THE SEVEN YEAR LIMIT FOR REPORTING TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY. THAT TELLS YOU THAT YOU WON'T BE SUED OR THAT YOUR DEBT WON'T BE REPORTED TO CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY. IF YOUR DEBT IS HELD BY A DEBT COLLECTOR YOU ARE REQUIRED TO GET THAT SAME NOTICE CONSUMERS HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHO ACTUALLY HOLDS THEIR DAD AT THIS STAGE. AND THEY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEBT BUYERS AND DEBT COLLECTORS THIS WOULD MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME NOTICE ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. THE SECOND IMPORTANT PIECE AT THAT AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX DOES IS IT MAKES THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS DO WHAT PEOPLE THINK IT ALREADY DOES. THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MEANS THAT AFTER FOUR YEARS YOU CAN NO LONGER. BE SUED ON THAT DEBT EXCEPT FOR FOR MANY CONSUMERS THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO RAISE IT AS AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE IN COURT. CURRENTLY ACCORDING TO A TWENTY FIFTEEN REPORT BY THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR STATE COURTS IN THE STATE JUSTICE INSTITUTE. AT LEAST ONE PARTY IN EVERY CIVIL STATE COURT CASE WAS SELF REPRESENTED AND THAT PARTY IS USUALLY. THE DEFENDANT IN MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF ALL CASES. MOST OF THOSE CASES ARE THEN DISPOSED THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS AND THEY'RE USUALLY DISPOSED OF THROUGH DEFAULT JUDGMENTS. WE ALREADY KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE JUSTICE CAP IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S NO STRETCH TO ASSUME THAT MOST OF THESE UNREPRESENTED CIVIL LITIGANTS WHO ARE GETTING DEFAULT JUDGMENTS FOR DEBTS. ARE LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA'S. CALIFORNIANS TO GIVE FURTHER CONTEXT IN OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF THE COMPLAINTS TO THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. CONSUMERS DISPUTED THE DEBT WAS OWED AT ALL THEY SAID IT WAS EITHER THE WRONG PERSON THE WRONG AMOUNT IT HAD ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR ALREADY BEEN SETTLED. IN CALIFORNIA THE REPRESENTATION OF LEGAL CIVIL. GOOD REPRESENTATION IN CIVIL CASES IT'S DEFINITELY NOT COMPLETE. FEW LEGAL SERVICES ARE ABLE TO REPRESENT LOW INCOMES CONSUMERS AND DEBT COLLECTION GIVING YEARS OF BUDGET CUTS AND FURTHER THREATS TO THEIR BUDGETS. THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO PRIORITIZE HOUSING FOOD ASSISTANCE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE FAMILY LAW ON IMMIGRATION. ALL THE WHILE KNOWING THAT POVERTY IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE LACK OF MONEY. DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS ONLY EXACERBATE THE SITUATION. RON COLEMAN HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMERS COALITION IS GOING TO SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED BY TIME BARRED DEBTS. AND SO IN SHORT AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX IS GOING TO ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS GET THE SAME INFORMATION WHEN THEY CAN NO LONGER BE SUED FOR A DAY OR DEBTS TOOL TO REPORT. AND IT ALSO PREVENTS UNREPRESENTED CONSUMERS FROM BEING SUED. IT'S NOT RADICAL BUT IT'S A PRACTICAL REFORM THAT WILL HELP MANY LOW INCOME AND OTHER CALIFORNIANS FACE THE DEBT COLLECTION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION. WE ARE COALITION OF LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ORGANIZATIONS FIGHTING FOR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS AND PARTNERSHIPS IN A NUMBER OF CASES SPARKED BY THE PROBLEMS IN WHICH AB FIFTEEN TWENTY SIX SIX TO ADDRESS IN ONE CASE THE CLIENT FROM PUBLIC LAWCENTER WAS SUED BY A THIRD PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR ON TWO COUNTS ONE AN OPEN BOOK CLAIM. ANOTHER AN ACCOUNT STATED CLAIM THE OPEN BOOK CLAIM WAS BARRED BY THE STATUE LIMITATIONS BECAUSE THE. THE LAST PAYMENT WAS MADE ON JANUARY EIGHTEENTH TWENTY THIRTEEN IN THE CASE WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CLIENT WITH THE INCREDIBLY STRESSED OUT ABOUT THIS CASE AND CAME TO PLC NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. UP PUBLIC LAWCENTER WE SUBSTITUTED INTO THE CASE INVOLVED IN MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS ARGUING THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THE FENCE. THE PLAINTIFF DISMISSED THE CASE THAT VERY SAME DAY CLEARLY THIS IS A LITTLE ANTI CLIMATIC BUT HOW THE CLIENT NOT FOUND OUT ABOUT PLC SHE LIKELY WOULD HAVE ENDED UP WITH A DEFAULT JUDGMENT. AS SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT TO DO ABOUT DEFENDING HER CASE AND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT THE COLLECTION AGENCY ONLY HAD FOUR YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE LAST PAYMENT TO SUE. IN ANOTHER SITUATION WITH THE CLIMATE FROM A CLIENT FROM PUBLIC LAWCENTER WHO WAS CONTACTED BY A COLLECTION AGENCY ON BEHALF OF NOW BEING FOR TO DEBTS THAT ARE LONG PAST THE STATUE LIMITATIONS THE DATA RELATED TO TUITION DEBTS FOR PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN SO THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOUR. YEAR EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE IN FOR PARENTS WHILE THE FORGIVENESS APPLICATION IS BEING PROCESS ONCE THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER ATTORNEY HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE NOTICES THEY SAW LANGUAGE AND DATES THAT SHOWED AN INDICATED THAT THE DEBTS. WERE PASSED THE STATUTE LIMITATION. BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT A SOMEWHAT EDUCATED PERSON. THAT WHO THE CONSUMER IS VERY CONFUSED WHEN PRESENTED WITH THESE DEBT COLLECTION LETTERS ON THESE TIME BAR DEBTS. UP FROM WHAT WE LEARN FROM OUR LEGAL SERVICES ATTORNEYS THAT ARE ON THE GROUND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ABLE TO CONVINCE A FEW PEOPLE NOT TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY. US CERTAINLY WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE. DESTROY THEIR CREDIT FOR SEVEN TO TEN YEARS OF COURSE WITH CHAPTER THIRTEEN SEVEN YEARS CHAPTER TEN. R. CHAPTER SEVEN BEING TEN YEARS OUT WHICH IS NOT WHAT MOST LOW INCOME RENTERS USE WHEN THEY DO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY BANKRUPTCY WE ALSO HEAR A LOT OF STORIES RELATED TO MEDICAL DEBT ON THESE ISSUES AS WELL SO CENTRAL CALIFORNIA LEGAL SERVICES AND THE CENTRAL. VALLEY REGULARLY REPRESENTS CONSUMERS THAT HAVE ISSUES WITH MEDICAL DEBT IN ONE RECENT CASE AN ELDERLY CLIENT LIVING ON FIXED INCOME WITH SUIT FOR TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THAT WAS INTEREST ALONE. FOUR LEDUC WILL DEBT RATING FROM SEVEN TO FOURTEEN YEARS DECLINE HAD NEVER BEEN BUILT FOR ANY OF THIS A FACT THE COLLECTION AGENCY ACKNOWLEDGED AND STATED THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO FIND HER. ANOTHER ELDERLY CONSUMER WENT TO SEE FEEL AS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY OF THE CLIENT HAD BEEN GIVEN NO NOTICE OF ITS RIGHTS AND NO INFORMATION ABOUT THE ORIGINAL DEBT AND UPON INVESTIGATION THE COLLECTION AGENT. COULD NOT EVEN SHOW A LINK BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CREDITOR AND THAT ACTUAL CLIENT SO AS YOU CAN SEE YOU KNOW AB FIFTEENTH FIFTEEN TWENTY THINK THIS. IS A REASONABLE APPROACH IT'S DESPERATELY NEEDED FOR CONSUMERS THAT BY THEMSELVES AND WE SITUATIONS WITH THESE TIME BY DEBTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ASK YOUR AYE. VOTE. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT PLEASE. MARY JUNE FOURTH ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. RIGHT SEEN OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION.
