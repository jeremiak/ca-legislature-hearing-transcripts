WELL WE RECENTLY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION TO SUPPORT TPS RECIPIENTS FROM A SOLID OR THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER IMMIGRANT GROUPS THAT REQUIRE. OUR SUPPORT INCLUDING NICARAGUANS AND HAITIANS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AT THIS BILL IS ON CURRENT EFFORTS TO ASSIST MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT HAVE BEEN STRIPPED OF THEIR PROTECTIONS AND MADE VULNERABLE. FOR REMOVAL FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY DECADES. THESE DEPORTATIONS WILL COST OUR STATE THOUSANDS OF LAW ABIDING HARDWORKING RESIDENTS WHO CONTINUE WHO CONTRIBUTE MILLIONS TO OUR ECONOMY. TPS RECIPIENTS ARE ALSO PARENTS TO CHILDREN WHO ARE U. S. BORN. AND IF THEY ARE FORCED TO LEAVES THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WILL BE TORN APART WHICH IS NOT. IN LINE WITH THE VALUES OF OUR STATE. THESE SHIFTING FEDERAL POLICIES LEAVE LARGE POPULATIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S RESIDENTS FEELING EXPOSED AND HOPELESS VULNERABLE AND FEARFUL MANY WHO HAVE. SET ME AND TOO I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUE AND MANY OTHERS THAT THERE'S EVEN SUICIDAL TENDENCIES EYES SPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEIR FUTURE IS LIKE. OR FOR PARENTS WHO FEEL THAT THEY HAVE FAILED THEIR THEIR CHILDREN IN SOME WAY. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HEALTHY AND THAT INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS. ESPECIALLY FOR THESE VERY CRITICAL ISSUES THAT IMPACT. BOB THE VERY BEING OF OUR COMMUNITIES REALLY ACROSS OUR STATE.

I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO. THANK YOU. FIRST WITNESS PLACE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS STEPHANIE I AM A CHILD OF THE TPS HOLDER AND A MEMBER OF THE CENTER MAYOR CAN RESOURCE CENTER. KNOWN AS COURTESY. OF CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WHICH WILL HELP PROVIDE DEPORTATION DEPENDS TO INDIVIDUALS LEFT FULLER BY THE RESULT OF THE TPS TERMINATION FOR A SITE ABOUT THE ORDER AND SEVERAL OTHER COUNTRIES. I'M HERE TO TELL MY STORY AS ONE OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND U. S. BORN CHILDREN OF TPS HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA FILLED WITH PAIN. AND LIVING IN FEAR BECAUSE OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO ANTI PRESS FOR SO MANY COUNTRIES. I'M A TWENTY ONE YEAR OLD COLLEGE STUDENT. AND MY FATHER'S A TPS HOLDER FROM ASSAD WHETHER MY FATHER HAS BEEN LIVING IN THIS COUNTRY FOR OVER TWENTY TWO YEARS HE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY FLEEING THE CIVIL WAR CIVIL WAR IN IN SOME OF THE. MY FATHER'S A MOST HARD WORKING AND LOYAL MAN I KNOW AND I'M AFRAID OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO HIM FOR MOST TO TAKE. HERE'S MY FAMILY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY LIFE WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MY FATHER'S DEPORTATION. UNTIL THE TPS TERMINATION FOR SALVADOR WAS ANNOUNCED IN JANUARY. THIS TPS TERMINATION ANNOUNCEMENT HAS TERRIFYING MY FATHER AND AFFECTED MY ENTIRE FAMILY. MY FATHER HAS A WIFE FOR CHILDREN AND THREE GRANDCHILDREN IN THE U. S.. MY OLDER SISTERS FINISHING HER MASTERS AND CYBERSECURITY MY BROTHERS SERVING IN THE U. S. ARMY AND MY YOUNGER SISTER AND I ARE BOTH COLLEGE STUDENTS. AS A TPS HOLDER MY FATHER WAS ABLE TO GET A JOB AS AN INDUSTRIAL PLUMBER AND WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE HIS FIRST HOME. HE PAYS HIS TAXES LOSING TPS MEANS THAT TAXPAYERS LIKE MY FATHER WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS AND FAMILIES LIKE MINE WILL BE AT RISK OF SEPARATION DUE TO DEPORTATION. MY MOTHER IS CURRENTLY DISABLED UNABLE TO WORK AND I ALSO HAVE A YOUNGER SISTER HOME. WITHOUT MY FATHER SUPPORT I WILL HAVE TO PUT MY COLLEGE ON HOLD TO IT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOR MY FAMILY. I WANT TO HAVE MY FATHER AT MY COLLEGE GRADUATION MY FATHER'S A REASON WHY PUSH SO HARD IN SCHOOL. SINCE THE TERMINATION OF TIPIS WERE SALVADORAN COMMUNITY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO SLEEP LARA DAY GOES BY WITHOUT THINKING BUT THE DAYS I HAVE LEFT WITH MY FATHER. TODAY I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN A SEC AND EXACTING SITUATION I STAND HERE BECAUSE OF THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH THAT MY FATHER INSTILLED IN ME. A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WOULD BRING BACK SOME LEVEL OF CERTAINTY. AND HOPED TO THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY FIND THEMSELVES IN NEED OF DEPORTATION REPRESENTATION. CALIFORNIA MUST LEAD IN ENSURING THAT TPS HOLDERS IN OUR STATE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL REPRESENTATION AFTER THE IMMIGRATION STATUS AND. A. B. EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WILL HELP TO PROVIDE JUSTICE TO THOSE AFFECTED BY TPS TERMINATIONS AND KEEP FAMILIES LIKE MINE TOGETHER. ON BEHALF OF OVER FIFTY THOUSAND U. S. CHILDREN OF TPS HOLDERS IN CALIFORNIA I ASK FOR YOUR ABLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS ITEM. EXPERTS.

THE FACE OF THOSE WERE GOING TO BE AFFECTED AND CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING IN COLLEGE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. ABOUT. IN I JUST WANNA MAKE THE POINT THAT A THE. ISSUE THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY IS NOT WHETHER OR NOT. TPI SHOULD BE ENDED OR WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A FAIR THING TO DO TOO THE. IMMIGRANTS THAT. ARE HERE AS A RESULT OF THAT PROGRAM WERE DISCUSSING WHETHER OR NOT TO ALLOCATE TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY TO THE LEGAL DEFENSE OF A PEOPLE WHO. ARE POSING A. A CHANGE IN FEDERAL LAW. SO. I HAVE TO RESPECT WOULD BE IN OPPOSITION ARE BUT I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHY. I IN ON VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND. WE EVERY YEAR GRAPPLE WITH THOUSANDS OF VERY WORTHY CAUSES WHO COME BEFORE US AND. MAKE THEIR PITCH FOR WHY WE SHOULD FUND WITH TAXPAYER MONEY THE PARTICULAR PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT DECISION TO FIGURE OUT. WHICH CAUSES ARE WORTHY BUT WHICH IS WHICH ARE NOT WORTHY HAD TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND. I'M CONCERNED THAT WERE NOT BEING DELIVERED ENOUGH IN. HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER USES TO WHICH THAT MONEY CAN BE PUT SO WILL GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES WE COULD FUND OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR MAMMOGRAMS HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND MAMMOGRAMS WITH THAT MONEY. WE COULD FIND ALMOST THREE THOUSAND SEMESTERS OF CS YOU TUITION AND AS YOU KNOW IN THE BUDGET THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DEBATING THIS YEAR WHETHER OR NOT. WE SHOULD BE INCREASING TUITION ON THOSE STUDENTS OR WHETHER NOT MORE STATE FUNDING UNNECESSARY SO. OTHER THOSE THE REASONS WHY I RESPECTFULLY HAVE TO POSE A BILL TODAY. THANK YOU AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT THIS IS A POLICY COMMITTEE AND THE POLICY THAT IS IN QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD FIND IT. OUR VALUES TO SUPPORT. THE TPS. THOSE WHO ARE POTENTIALLY BEING DENIED TPS STATUS IN CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY THIS WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS SO GO TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE NEXT HUMAN SERVICES AS WELL AS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WHERE THOSE BALANCING. ACTS CAN HAPPEN WHAT'S BEFORE US IS. NOT THE BUDGET QUESTION BUT MERELY STATEMENTS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE FEEL THAT THIS COMMITTEE FEELS THAT THIS. BILL AS A POLICY BILL MEETS OUR STANDARDS. THANK YOU. THE DRESS. I THINK ALSO TO THE COMMENT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT UBER TALKING ABOUT. USING TAXPAYERS MONEY. IT'S CLEAR THE TPS THOSE WERE PROTECTED BY TPS. OUR TAXPAYERS. OTHER CHILDREN ARE US BORN.

ENSURE THAT WE DO NOT REPEAT IT AND THAT WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD UP FOR YOUR. PRESENTATION HERE I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT JUST. A FEW. ACTS THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY. I AS STATED PUBLIC INDECENCY STATUTES AND UNLAWFUL MASQUERADE LAWS WERE APPLIED TO PERMIT POLICE TO HARASS AND SOMETIMES ARREST. PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERED DEVIANT. AND OR GENDER BENDING.

AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT A WITH ME ALSO IT ARE MEMBERS OF A CO YOU AND EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS GOOD MORNING ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. I WANTED TO SHARE THAT A LOT OF THE FOCUS OF OUR ORGANIZATION AT THIS TIME IS ADDRESSING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. AND WE SEE THAT THEY'RE POOR OUTCOMES WHETHER IT'S AROUND MENTAL HEALTH FAMILY REJECTION. HIGHER RATES OF SUICIDE POORER HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES. IN A LOT OF THIS IS BECAUSE OF THIS HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION UNDER THE LAW. AND WHILE WE'VE COME A REALLY LONG WHY ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. OF OF BRINGING OUR STATE. TO BE ONE OF MOST PROTECTIVE OF MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY ON IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE PAST THEM HARM IT'S DONE. AND THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE WORK TO DO THAT THE STRUGGLE CONTINUES SO. WE THINK MR LOW AND THE CAUCUS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IT'S A IT'S A SYMBOLIC GESTURE BUT IT'S ONE THAT SENDS A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE TO MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT WERE PART OF THE FABRIC OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WERE LOVED AND CELEBRATED. URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH WOODS. BECCA KRAMER MATTER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONE I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION THAT RECOGNIZED AS AND GIVES VOICE TO. CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST LGBTQ PERSONS AND THE HARM THAT HAS RESULTED FROM THOSE LAWS. WHILE CALIFORNIA'S LAWS MORE RECENTLY HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE INCLUSIVE AND PROTECTIVE OF LGBTQ CALIFORNIANS. THIS HISTORY THAT OUR STATE HAS OF CRIMINALIZING AND DISCRIMINATING AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY HAS CREATED LONG LASTING HARM. AS MY COLLEAGUE ALEX WAS IT POINTED OUT SOME OF THOSE CONTINUING REPERCUSSIONS. BUT KNOWLEDGE IN AND APOLOGIZING FOR CALIFORNIA HAS PASSED LGBTQ DISCRIMINATION. ACR WHEN SEVENTY TWO GIVES VOICE TO THE HARM THE STATE HAS DONE FOSTER PROMISING TO PRO ACTIVELY REMEDY THE HARMS AND ADDRESSED. THE. THE STATE'S LAWS TO MAKE IT IN EVEN SAFER AND MORE EQUAL PLACE FOR THE LGBTQ MEANT Q. COMMUNITY AND FOR THESE REASONS THE ACLU ISN'T A PART. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. SINGER BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE A COMMERCIAL ó FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AND. OFTENTIMES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO GO THROUGH AND CLEAN UP THAT THE LEGISLATURE CERTAINLY HAS BEEN WORKING ON CLEANING UP. OLD THAT IT HAD A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ESPECIALLY DISCRIMINATORY EFFECT. BUT IN THE CASE OF THE LGBT IQ COMMUNITIES WHILE LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT WERE NOT NECESSARILY TARGETED TOWARDS THAT COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN USED AGAINST THAT CAN BE. AND SO FOR THE. STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STEP BACK. CONTINUE TO LOOK AT DISCRIMINATORY LOSS WHICH WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO BUT TO TAKE A STEP BACK. AND. ISSUE AN APOLOGY MAKE A VERY CLEAR STATEMENT THAT WE WILL NOT BROKE LAWS BEING USED FOR DISCRIMINATORY PURPOSES AND THAT WE INTEND TO CLEAN UP THE LAWS TO TAKE A DISCRIMINATION NOT I THINK IT'S A VERY APPROPRIATE STATEMENT. ADDRESS. I DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THEY OFTEN SAY THAT TOO FOR REAL HEALING IT ISN'T JUST TO APOLOGIZE BUT ALSO PROMISE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT AGAIN.

GONZALEZ FLETCHER. CONSULT FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN I REYES. REYES I. THAT IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY. THAT TAKES US TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY FOUR MS RUBIO. GOOD MORNING. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY THREE FIFTY FOUR A BILL THAT WILL HELP ENSURE EQUITY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS BY MANDATING THAT WE HAVE COURT REPORTERS PRESIDENT CHILD CUSTODY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROCEEDINGS. I TOOK AMENDMENTS TO INCLUDE CHILD CUSTODY PROCEEDINGS IN ADDITION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROCEEDINGS. ACCESS TO A A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT IS CRITICAL AYE AND CRITICAL COMPONENT DURING COURT HEARINGS WHERE PARTY'S OVERWHELMINGLY REPRESENT THEMSELVES. THE LACK OF COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY COURT CASES HAS CREATED MANY ISSUES PARTICULARLY AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD CUSTODY. PROTECTIVE ORDERS WITHOUT A RECORD OF THE HEARING. LITIGANTS ARE UNABLE TO APPEAL DECISIONS THAT ARE. THAT ARE CONTRARY TO VICTIMS SAFETY WE NEED TO BE PATIENT AND PROVIDE CHILDREN AND FAMILY. WITH. THE SUPPORT IT INTERVENTIONS THEY NEED TO START A SUCCESSFUL UP PAT HERE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A WITNESS NUMBER ONE I HAVE JENNIFER WAXMAN DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS FOR IT FAMILY VIOLENCE. ACT APPELLATE. PROJECT ARABIC NOT YOU HERNANDEZ REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION AND I ALSO HAVE A BROOKLINE IMMEDIATE PAST PAIRS PRESIDENT THINK. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. I HAVE GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JENNIFER. I JENNIFER DORFMAN WAGNER I AND THE DIRECTOR OF PROGRAMS FOR FAMILY BALANCE A PILOT PROJECT. FAMILY BALANCE THE PILOT PROJECT WAS FOUNDED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TO HELP LOW AND MODERATE INCOME SURVIVORS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. OBTAIN EFFECTIVE APPELLATE REPRESENTATION WE ARE A STATE BAR FUNDED SUPPORT CENTER FOR LEGAL AID PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA. WE SUBMITTED SIMILAR TESTIMONY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO THE FUTURES COMMISSION. APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN WHICH WE WERE JOINED BY TWENTY ONE PUBLIC INTEREST ORGANIZATIONS WE HAVE NO DOUBT THESE ORGANIZATIONS WILL ALSO JOIN IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEP APPRECIATION THAT ASSEMBLY WOMAN RUBIO IS RAISING THE ISSUE OF HOW TO PROVIDE A VERBATIM RECORD AND FAMILY VIOLENCE AND CUSTODY CASES. AND THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS HOLDING A HEARING ABOUT THIS VERY IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. AS SET FORTH IN OUR WRITTEN SUBMISSION THE CREATION OF A VERBATIM RECORD IS ESSENTIAL FOR PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING SURVIVORS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO FOCUS OUR COMMENTS TODAY ON THE PRAGMATIC REASONS WHY THIS IS SO. EVEN BEFORE THE NEED FOR AN APPEAL ARISES ACCESS TO A VERBATIM TRANSCRIPT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR THOSE LITIGANTS AT THE TRIAL LEVEL. WHERE THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY APPEARING ON THEIR OWN BEHALF? FIRST VERBATIM RECORDS ARE NEEDED TO CRAFT ACCURATE POST HEARING RESTRAINING ORDERS OR CHILD CUSTODY IN BUSINESS VISITATION ORDERS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS CAN ENFORCE. SECOND VERBATIM RECORDS ARE NEEDED BECAUSE CUSTODY AND VISITATION CASES ARE FREQUENTLY LITIGATED. AND REVISITED OVER MANY YEARS. COURT NEEDS A CLEAR RECORD OF PAST PROCEEDINGS TO DETERMINE WHETHER CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE ALTERING CUSTODY OR VISITATION SCHEDULES. MORE OVER FAMILY JUDGES OFTEN ONLY SERVED ONE OR TWO YEARS SO LATER JUDGES ASSIGNED TO A CASE NEED A CLEAR RECORD OF WHAT HAS PREVIOUSLY HAPPENED IN THE CASE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE CASE. A VERBATIM RECORD IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL ON APPEAL. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE APPEAL IN MANY CASES WILL BE DISMISSED OR DENIED WITHOUT A REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT GRANTED REVIEW IN THE CASE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE JAMESON VERSUS DOSTA WHERE THE APPELLATE COURT HELD THAT THE LACK OF A REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT PRECLUDED. THE REPRESENT OUR THE LITIGANT REPRESENTING HIMSELF FROM ATTAINING A REVERSAL OF THE GRANT OF A MOTION FOR NON SUIT. DUE TO THE LARGE VOLUME UNLIMITED JUDICIARY SOURCES WRITTEN OPINIONS ARE THE EXCESS XIN AND FAMILY VIOLENCE CASES. AND EVEN WHEN THEY EXIST THEY OFTEN DO NOT SET FORTH THE FINDINGS THAT SERVICE THE BASIS FOR AN APPEAL. IN MOST OF FAMILY VIOLENCE THE PILOT PROJECTS CASES EVIDENTIARY OR TESTIMONIAL ISSUES NOT CONTAINED IN A WRITTEN ORDER. ARE THE ISSUE ON APPEAL. SINCE THESE APPEALS ARRIVE IN CASES INVOLVING FACT INTENSIVE REQUESTS FOR RESTRAINING ORDERS AND CUSTODY TERMINATIONS. THESE FACTOR TERMINATIONS AND THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING OR CONTRADICTING THEM WILL NEARLY ALWAYS BE AT ISSUE ON APPEAL. MORE OVER AGREED OR SETTLED STATEMENTS ARE NOT A REALISTIC ALTERNATIVE FOR THE GREAT MAJORITY OF FAMILY VIOLENCE THE PILOT PROJECTS CLIENTS. AN AGREED STATEMENT REQUIRES THE VICTIM TO COLLABORATE WITH THEIR ABUSER. EITHER DIRECTLY OR FROM THE DIS ADVANTAGEOUS POSITION OF A PRO SE LITIGANT FACING PROFESSIONAL COUNSEL THEM BY A TEACHER WRAP UP THE A SURE. I'M JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF AN UPDATE AT THE SAN FRANCISCO BAR SO SEASON RECENTLY POSTED THAT AS RECENTLY AS TWENTY SIXTEEN ONLY FIFTEEN COURTS WERE RIPPED WHERE WERE. PROVIDING COURT REPORTERS AND ALL FAMILY LAW CASES SO THIS IS A CONTINUING ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THAT'S.
