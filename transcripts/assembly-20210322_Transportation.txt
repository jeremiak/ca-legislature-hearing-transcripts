MICHAEL IN THIS COMMITTEE IS TO TRY TO MAKE OUR STATE'S TRANSPORTATION POLICIES AS PROGRESSIVE AN ASPIRATIONAL AND AS CONCERNED WITH OUR HUGE ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE IN MOBILITY OPTIONS AS THE REST OF OUR STATE'S POLICIES- WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE OUR STREETS MUCH SAFER. OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES INCREASED BY 8% IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY DESPITE THERE BEING A LOT LESS DRIVING BECAUSE OF CODE NINETEEN WHICH SHOWS US THAT THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY PREVENTING A LOT OF LOSS OF LIFE ON OUR ROADS IS TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE. THIS HAS BEEN THE GREATEST A SINGLE YEAR INCREASE IN TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND INJURIES IN NINETY SIX YEARS SO WE ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THE STATE AND NEED TO RE CENTER OUR FOCUS ON KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE. I AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO DO THIS YEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION. TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN THE ONE AREA IN OUR STATE WHERE WE'VE GONE THE WRONG DIRECTION WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND REDUCING EMISSIONS. WE KNOW THAT TRANSPORTATION IS THE CAUSE OF APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE STATE'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK IN THAT AREA. WE ALSO REALLY DO OUR CONSTITUENTS A DISSERVICE BY NOT PROVIDING THEM ROBUST MOBILITY OPTIONS THAT WILL INCREASE PUBLIC HEALTH CLEAN UP OUR AIR. AND BE A LOT MORE ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE FOR A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS PARTICULARLY LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS. SIMPLY PUT WE NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE IN TRANSIT IN MASS TRANSIT. THAT IS CONVENIENT AND SAFE. AND FAST AND MORE DESIRABLE FOR OUR RESIDENTS NOT JUST FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BUT FOR BETTER LAND USE POLICIES. FOR UGH EQUITY FOR ALL OF THE THINGS THAT MAKE FOR WORLD CLASS COMMUNITIES AND I HOPE THAT YOU ALL WILL JOIN ME. IN THOSE GOALS. TODAY WERE ALSO GOING TO BE ADOPTING THE COMMITTEE RULES IN THE COMMITTEES HIGHWAY NAME POLICY NOW HERE'S SOMETHING A LITTLE BIT SHOCKING. AS OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OVER SEVEN HUNDRED SECTIONS OF FREEWAYS HIGHWAYS AND STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN NAMED HOWEVER. VERY FEW OF THOSE NAMES ARE THOSE OF WOMEN. IN FACT MY STUFF WENT THROUGH THE NAMES AND FOUND THAT LESS THAN OUT OF SEVEN HUNDRED NAMES. LESS THAN FIFTY OF THEM ARE NAMES OF WOMEN. SO IS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I PLAN TO PUT A STOP TO THAT. AND WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I WILL TAKE FIVE NAMES AND IF THEY'RE ALL MEN I WILL NOT ALLOW FOR ANY MORE RESOLUTIONS NAMING HIGHWAYS WITH THIS COMMITTEE. UNTIL WE HAVE FIVE WOMEN. OKAY THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA PLANT THAT'S MY PLAN. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DEMAND. A LITTLE BIT OF REPRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT OF EQUITY. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE PROMOTING AND CELEBRATING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF WOMEN AND THERE'S PLENTY OF WOMEN OUT THERE THAT WE CAN HONOR. IN THIS WAY. A MAY I HAVE A MOTION FOR THE COMMITTEE RULES AND HIGH WINNING POLICY I HAVE A MOTION TO HAVE A SECOND. YEAH A MOTION AND A SECOND. DO WE NED IT WE VOTE ON THE RULES NOW.

PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. I CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON AMENDMENTS WHICH WE GLADLY ACCEPT THIS BILL APPLIES THE PENALTIES FOR ILLEGAL STREET RACING TO ALSO APPLY TO THE EXHIBITION OF SPEED. WHICH IS COMING OUT AS SIDE SHOWS OR CARS ARE BURNING TIRES OUT REVVING ENGINES AND PERFORMING STUNTS TO SHOW OFF TO A CROWD IN OUR STREETS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW ENGAGING IN AN EXHIBITION OF SPEED IS OFTEN COMBIND WITH STREET RACING AND RECKLESS DRIVING THAT PUTS SO MANY PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AT RISK. THIS INTERACTIVITY HAS SPIKED TREMENDOUSLY STATEWIDE GETTING THE TRAGIC ACCIDENTS AND SENSELESS DEATH OF ARGUE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE CHP HAS REPORTED A NEARLY 3100% SURGE IN MOTOR VEHICLE EXHIBITION SPEED CITATIONS. BUT SADLY NOT ALL SPEED EXHIBITION CASES AND WITH EDUCATION NEARLY INJURY 42% RESULT IN PROPERTY DAMAGE. AND 11% RESULT IN DEATH. THIS RECKLESS BEHAVIOR PLACES STREETS OF HOW. CLAIMS INNOCENT LIVES. INPUTS COMMUTERS PEDESTRIANS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AT RISK. I'M SURE WE ALL KNOW OF THESE TRAGIC EVENTS IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS AND NEIGHBORHOODS. JUST LAST MONTH. MY KERN COUNTY COMMITTEE LOST ANOTHER INNOCENT RESIDENT AND A STREET RACING CRASH. THAT ENDED IN A FATAL HIT AND RUN AS THE VICTIM WAS CROSSING THE STREET. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND KERN COUNTIES MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING CHAPTER HAVE STRESSED THAT THIS TROUBLING TREND IS OFTEN CORRELATED WITH THINGS LIKE DRUNK AND DRUG DRIVING. AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. I WANT TO CLEAR THE EIGHTY THREE DOES NOT CREATE A NEW CRIME. RATHER GIVES THE COURT THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ACTION ON SPEED EXHIBITION INSIDE SHOWS. PERFORMING RECKLESS BEATS DUNSTAN STREET RACES ARE EQUALLY DANGEROUS AND POSE AN EQUAL RISK TO OUR ROADS. AND COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER ONLY CAN FOR THE LATTER CAN RESULT IN A SUSPENDED LICENSE AB THREE CLOSES THAT LOOPHOLE. AB THREE SUPPORTER BY MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING AND STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ITEM. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS HEATHER AND THE OUT. HEATHER AND THE- DUBINSKY. WHO ARE SECOND RESIDENTS AND THE PARENTS OF AUSTIN. GOING TO A MAJOR MAJOR PHYSICAL INJURIES DUE TO A SPEED RALLY ACCIDENT LESS THAN A YEAR AGO. I PASSED AROUND SOME PHOTOS TO THE COMMITTEE. SO THAT THEY CAN SEE THE PAIN ENDURED BY THE FAMILY AS HEATHER AND LEO PROVIDED TESTIMONY I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL TAKE THE FIRST WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE FOR THE WITNESS. ONE MOMENT WE CAN'T HEAR YOU- JUST GIVE US ONE MOMENT. WHY DON'T YOU TRY AGAIN LET'S SEE IF IT STARTS AT. NOPE SORRY I'M A BIGGER PART IN PLEASE PAUSE FOR A MOMENT. WE'RE WORKING IT OUT ON OUR END JUST GIVE US A MOMENT PLEASE AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HELLO YES WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW OKAY OKAY. HI MY NAME'S HEATHER DUBINSKY IN THIS IS MY HUSBAND LEO TWO MINUTES GAME ON SEPTEMBER TWELFTH WE GOT THE PHONE CALL THAT NO PARENT SHOULD EVER GET. OUR SON AS I KNEW I HAD BEEN. IN A CAR WRECK THAT'S ALL I KNEW UNTIL I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL. AND FOUND OUT THAT MY SON WAS HIT BY A CAR AND BASICALLY DRAGGED UNDER. IT INJURIES WORK TREMENDOUS. THE FIRST NIGHT THAT HE WAS IN THE ER HE HAD HIS FIRST HE WAS RUSHED INTO SURGERY HAD HIS SPLEEN REMOVED AND TO HOPE THEY FIXED ALL THE BLEEDING INTERNALLY AND HE WAS MOVED INTO THE ICY YOU. IN THE FIRST WEEK HE HAD THREE SURGERIES- THE FIRST ONE HE HAD HIS GOAL PART OF A SCHOOL REMOVED BECAUSE THE BRAIN SWELLING WAS SO BAD. AND AFTER ABOUT TWO DAYS LATER THREE DAYS LATER- HE HAD PELVIS FIXED IT WAS COMPLETELY BROKEN HE HAD MULTIPLE- TISSUE AND SCRAPES AND HOLES IN HIS BODY HE WAS BASICALLY ON THE VERGE OF DEATH. FOUR DAYS INTO- BEING THERE FOR A FULL TWO MONTHS- THERE WAS ACTUALLY A PER RALLY- OUTSIDE PHYSICALLY DISTANCED WEARING MASKS. AND THE PRAYERS WERE PRAYED BY THREE HAVE OVER THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE FROM MY SIDE TO HAVE FORGOT TO GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE. I'M FINDING IT OUT THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT THAT ANOTHER BOY HAD DIED IN ELK GROVE IT JUST MADE ME SO SAD- BECAUSE I'VE I'VE BEEN GIVEN MY SON'S BEEN GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE BUT- IN LEARNING ABOUT THIS IF THERE BEEN SO MANY DEATHS OF YOUNG KIDS. AND BEING TOLD BY ONE OF GOOD NURSES WHEN MY SON GOT OUT OF I SEE YOU'VE GOT HE'S ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES THEY NEVER SEE A RECOVERY LIKE THIS. AND MY SON IS STILL RECOVERING HE'S STILL- WORKING ON WALKING. THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE I JUST WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THAT HAVE OTHER FAMILIES NOT HAVE TO GO WHAT OUR FAMILY WENT THROUGH. THAT IS ALL. I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORY AND I'M VERY VERY SORRY FOR THE TRAUMA THAT YOUR SON HAS GONE THROUGH AND YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH WITH THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO SHARE WITH US TODAY DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT NO THAT IS A GOOD IDEA WHO IT IS OKAY. I DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YES MA'AM CHARACTERS. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN PLEASE PROCEED YOUR TWO MINUTES. GREAT THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA- LET ME START BY SAYING HOW SORRY I AM FOR WHAT THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND THEIR SON HAVE HAD TO THE DOOR. I THINK WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF TRYING TO PREVENT INCIDENTS LIKE THAT. UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT ANYTHING IN THIS BILL WILL ACTUALLY HELP TO PREVENT- OF THE OCCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE. ON I CURRENT LAW MAKES THE EXHIBITION OF MISDEMEANOR. BY A JAIL TERM OF UP TO NINETY DAYS. A FINE OF UP TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR BOTH. WITH HIGHER PENALTIES AVAILABLE WHEN THE INCIDENT RESULT IN INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE. IN ADDITION THE OFFICER MAKING THE ARREST CAN SEIZE THE VEHICLE AND IMPOUND FOR UP TO THIRTY DAYS. ADDING LICENSE SUSPENSION TO THE PENALTIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS BEHAVIOR WILL NOT STOP DRIVERS FROM ENGAGING IN EXHIBITION THE- INSTEAD FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING TO FIND THEIR WAY TOWARD THE MORE LAW ABIDING LIFE. WILL BECOME ONE MORE HURDLE STANDING IN THE WAY OF THEM BEING ABLE TO DRIVE LEGALLY TO ATTEND SCHOOL TO TAKE OTHERS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD TO THEIR WORKPLACES OR TO TAKE THEMSELVES OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS MEDICAL POINT. YET NOTHING IN AB THREE CALLS UPON THE JUDGE TO TAKE ANY OF THESE FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER TO SEND SOMEONE LIKE. PILING ON NEW PENALTIES DOES LITTLE TO REDUCE CRIME BUT INSTEAD CAN HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT HARMS THE JOLT AND IT'S HIGHER UNITY. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR LOCAL. THANK YOU WITHOUT WILL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTARY- IS THERE ANYBODY IN THE CHAMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL SEEING NONE WILL OPEN GO TO THE PHONE LINES FOR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION- OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE BRING THAT- BRING US ANY COLORS WERE. PRESENT TO SPEAK ON THE BILL. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO MAKE A COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE AND ZERO AT THIS TIME. I CURRENTLY HAVE THREE IN Q. WILL GO TO LINE THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD.

THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER FONG WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES- I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THAT CERTAINLY WE JUST WANT TO GIVE THE COURT THE DISCRETION TO HAVE THIS- THIS OPTION- TO- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. YES THERE SHOULD BE NOTICED- THERE SHOULD. AM I MY OPINION AND I THINK THAT IF YOU HEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY THE FACT THAT THE EXHIBITION OF SPEED IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM A SPEED CONTEST- THEY SHOULD BE TREATED THE SAME AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR IS FOR THE COURT. TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME- PUNISHMENTS AND- AND PENALTIES AS A SPEECH CONTEST AND THAT'S AND SO STRICTLY ASPEN HIGH ABOVE. THANK YOU ARE THEIR INCOME. OR FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS. YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST RESET UP THE ACLU'S OPPOSITION- I HAD HEARD YOU WERE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET THEM OFF OPPOSITION IS THAT CORRECT. YES IT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ACLU AND THE OPPOSITION TO REMOVE THEIR- THEIR OPPOSITION WE CERTAINLY ARE OPEN TO EXEMPTIONS I THINK THAT OUR BILL HAS AN EXEMPTION TO ALLOW AN INDIVIDUAL TO. HAVE THEIR LICENSE TO OUGHT TO GO TO WORK- WE WILL BE OPEN TO IT TO ADDING AN EDUCATION EXEMPTION AS WELL BUT- AND THOSE THINGS WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK OUT. AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WITH THAT TAKING THOSE MOMENTS YOU'LL GET THEM OFF OPPOSITION BUT IF THAT IF AS HAS MENTIONED- BY THE ACLU THAT IS OUR CONCERN THAT IT'S TOO RESTRICTIVE AND SO WE WOULD BE WE WOULD HOPEFULLY BE OPEN TO WORKING WITH. YOU AND IF THEY ARE OPEN TO THOSE TWO EGGS- TO- EXEMPTIONS WHICH WERE OPEN TO AS WELL- WE'RE HAPPY. TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REMOVE THE OPPOSITION. DEMAND FOR. OPPOSITE WOULD HAVE. YEAH IT I'M- I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE BUT A- YOU WOULD COULD WOULD YOU MIGHT ADDRESS THAT STEVE THAT. WOULD THAT WOULD PLAY OFF OPPOSITION IF YOU TO TAKE MOMENTS- SO. IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO SAY IN PORTLAND WITHOUT- IN LANGUAGE I THINK WHAT WOULD BRING UP A COMPETITION. IS TO EXTEND THE EXEMPTION THAT CAN BE ALLOWED. UNDER THE LAW THAT CURRENTLY. ISN'T QUITE OR- BENEFITS SPEED RACING- PROVISION- REGARDING. TRAVEL TO AND FROM WORK- TO. ALLOW FOR TRAVEL TO AND FROM SCHOOL BUT ALSO TO- PUT IN LANGUAGE TO. REQUIRE THE JUDGE IN CONSIDERING WHETHER TO SUSPEND SOMEONE'S LIFE AND- OTHER IMPACT ON THE FAMILY THINGS LIKE- BEING ABLE TO TAKE OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS TO WORK OR- FAMILY MEMBERS. TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME CODE SECTION BUT THE PROVIDE A MODEL PROJECT- JUST GIVING THOSE. FACTORS THE JUDGE TO CONSIDER. IN MAKING THE TO. SO ALL I WOULD JUST SAY TO THE- THAT'S MY COLLEAGUES COURT HOLDS THE THAT THAT THE- TO. THIS INDIVIDUAL PLANS OR TO A DRIVER TO BE A LAW TO TRY TO AND FROM WORK AND WE WOULD ADD INS AS WELL HAVE TO WORK THE OPPOSITION WE HAVE NO. CONCERNS THAT WE WANT TO CODIFY. THAT DISCUSSIONS OF THE COURT IN SOME WAY BUT THE COURT HAS THE DISCRETION BUT IF WE WANTED. TO CODIFY THAT IN IN THE LAW- INTO THIS BILL. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. I I'LL JUST ADD AYE AYE DO HOPE THAT YOU WERE THE OPPOSITION. TO GET THEM OFF AND WITH THAT ALL OF A TO MOVE THE BILL. TODAY UNDER THAT HOPE THAT YOU DO THAT WITH THE CITY. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WELL I WANT TO THANK- OF VICE CHAIR FONG FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL WE HE DID TAKE. THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH MAKE SURE THAT THE LICENSE SUSPENSION SUSPENSION IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT. AT THE COURT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO PERMITTED DRIVER TO USE THE CAR. TO AND FROM WORK INSTEAD OF A FULL LICENSE SUSPENSION AND- SOUNDS LIKE HE'S OPEN TO. GIVING THE JUDGE A MOTHER DISCRETION IN IN CASE- AND ONCE AGAIN JUST TO REITERATE THIS BILL DOES NOT CREATE A NEW COME CRIME IT JUST BRINGS THIS TYPE OF SPEED- EXHIBITION IN LINE WITH STREET RACING AND- WE- FREQUENTLY SEE THIS YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY IN. LOS ANGELES OF THESE KINDS OF EXHIBITIONS OF SPEED AND BY THE WAY. THIS IS NOT USED IN JUST A SIMPLE SPEEDING CASE THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE- IT RACING CARS OFTEN FOR FROM. MONEY EXHIBITION SIDESHOWS BUT ON PUBLIC STREETS PUTTING THE PUBLIC IN GREAT HARM. AND THESE ARE NOT CARS A LOT OF TIMES THAT ARE BEING USED FOR WORK THESE ARE TRICKED OUT VEHICLES THAT GO TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILES AN HOUR THAT HAVE FIVE POINT RACING HARNESSES- THAT ARE. THAT ARE TRICKED OUT. SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. C. H. P. RESPOND OVER TO FIVE TO. CALLS FOR SPEED CONTESTS AND MOTOR VEHICLE EXHIBITIONS OF SPEED IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. WHICH IS THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. SPEEDING IS RESPONSIBLE 431% OF TRAFFIC FATALITIES. WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE IS HE'LL USE CONCERNS AND I APPLAUD THEM FOR SPEAKING UP FOR PEOPLE. DRIVING IS NOT A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IT'S A PRIVILEGE AND ONE THAT SHOULD NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE. OF INNOCENT BYSTANDERS AND PEOPLE WHO- EXHIBIT THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. REALLY NEED TO. HAVE THE CAR TAKEN AWAY FOR A WHILE QUITE HONESTLY. UNTIL THEY LEARN TO. HAVE SOME CONSIDERATION FOR OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE ROAD AND CERTAINLY. SOMEBODY LIKE. OUR WITNESSES SON. DESERVES HIS RIGHTS TO BE A BYSTANDER AND TO BE A PEDESTRIAN RESPECTED AS WELL. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I LOOK FOR TO VOTING FOR TODAY AND WITH THAT CAN YOU PLEASE OPEN THE ROLE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS FRIEDMAN. HI FRIEDMAN I FONG.

THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THINK MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STUFF FOR THE YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AB ONE TWENTY TWO WOULD MAKE INTERSECTIONS SAFER FOR BICYCLISTS DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS BY ALLOWING BICYCLISTS TO TREAT STOP SIGNS AS YIELD SIGNS WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION. WELL THIS MAY SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE YIELDING ALREADY THE LAW IT PROVIDES A CLEAR LEGAL DEFINITION AN EXPECTATION FOR THOSE REQUIRED TO YIELD A FOUR WAY INTERSECTIONS UNDER EXISTING YO BUT DON'T LAW THE DRIVER OF ANY VEHICLE INCLUDING EVIL BIKES APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION WITH THE YIELD RIGHT OF WAY SIGN. MUST YIELD TO ANY VEHICLES THAT HAVE ENTERED THAT INTERSECTION AB ONE TWENTY TWO USES OF COMMON UNDERSTANDING OF A YIELD SIGN TO ALLOW BICYCLISTS APPROACHING THE INTERSECTION TO SLOW DOWN AND YIELD TO ANY CARS AND PEDESTRIANS. ALREADY IN THE INTERSECTION IF IT IS SAFE TO DO SO THE BIKERS COULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. WITHOUT MAKING A COMPLETE STOP. WELL SUMMER STUDY ON BY THREE INDICATES THE PRICE. OFTEN YOU'LL OF AND- ALREADY THIS BILL IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE A COMMON EXPECTATION OF THIS BEHAVIOR THUS FURTHER IMPROVING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND EVERYONE'S SAFETY AT INTERSECTIONS. DELAWARE ADOPTED THE STUFF WITH THE OLD OFFER PRICE WITH THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE DELAWARE STATE POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS RECENTLY REPORTED A 23% REDUCTION IN ACCIDENTS INVOLVING BCYCLISTS AT INTERSECTIONS DURING THEIR FIRST THIRTY MONTHS DUE TO HAVING A CLEAR EXPECTATION. ON WHAT TO DO WHEN APPROACHING AN INTERSECTION. IN FACT OF THE SEVERAL THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY PASSED THE STOP AS YOU'LL LAWS NONE HAVE DISCOVERED DISCOVERED ANYTHING OTHER THAN IMPROVEMENTS. IN INTERSECTION SAFETY. WHETHER CALIFORNIANS RIDE FOR RECREATION AS PART OF A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE OR BECAUSE THAT THEY'RE ONLY TRANSPORTATION OPTION. AB ONE TWENTY TWO INSURERS THE BICYCLIST DRIVERS AND PEDESTRIANS ARE SAFE A FOUR WAY INTERSECTION. ALL ROADS NEED TO BE SAFE FOR ALL ROAD USERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE.

AND THE SHEER JOY OF BICYCLING IS A POWERFUL WAY TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER. WE DO A LOT OF WORK TO HELP FOLKS. HAVE DIGNITY AND SAFETY. AND BE RESPONSIBLE MEMBERS OF THEIR COMMUNITY WHEN THEY RIDE BY THIS BILL DOES THAT WHICH IS WHY WE'VE SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED STRONGLY. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT CRASHES GO UP WHEN THIS BILL IS IMPLEMENTED AND EVIDENCE THAT THEY MIGHT GO DOWN AT INTERSECTIONS. THERE'S ANOTHER SAFETY REASON AND I WANT TO MENTION. THAT OUR MEMBERS. PROBABLY SOME OF THEM HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ME MENTIONING BUT I THINK IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT AND THAT IS. THAT- PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO RIDE- BUSY ARTERIALS WITH FAST TRAFFIC LET'S BE REAL WE HAVE A RIGHT TO RIDE ON THOSE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO PROTECT THAT RIGHT BUT NOBODY REALLY LIKES TO BLOCK TRAFFIC BY TAKING THE LANE ON A FAST BUSY ARTERIALS. WHICH IS OFTEN THE ONLY WAY TO RIDE SAFELY ON STREETS LIKE THAT. IF WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO RIDE BIKES SAFELY INCLUDING PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT TO BE THE AGGRESSIVE BICYCLIST. WE REALLY HAVE TO. MAKE IT SAFE AND EASY FOR THEM TO TAKE THE SIDE STREETS. THIS BILL WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR MOTORISTS OR PEDESTRIANS- PEOPLE ON BIKES WILL STILL HAVE TO YIELD TO TRAFFIC AT INTERSECTIONS. AND STOP IF NECESSARY JUST LIKE THEY CURRENTLY DO- IT WILL CHANGE THINGS FOR PEOPLE O BIKES ARE NOT ONLY ABOUT TRAFFIC SAFETY BUT ALSO ABOUT PERSONAL SAFETY.

WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF VEHICLE CODE VIOLATIONS. OF THE MANY THAT THEY SEE EVERY DAY MOST ARE IGNORED. SOME OTHERS I DEALT WITH WAS STOP AND WARM. AND FEWER STILL FALL UNDER THE FINAL OPTION TO ENFORCE THE VIOLATION BY CITATION OR ARREST THESE MEN AND WOMEN IN POLICE UNIFORM FOR THE SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT COUNTLESS TIMES EVERY WORK DAY.

MR VOEPEL WHENEVER YOU'RE READY I AM A CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'D LIKE TO START OFF WITH THANK YOU THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M NOT A CAR PERSON. SO AB TWO TWENTY ASSEMBLY MOVING THE DATE OF SMALL EXEMPTION FOR COLLECTOR CARS FROM CARS MANUFACTURED BEFORE. NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX TO NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THAT'S JUST ADVANCE UNIT SEVEN YEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME CONFUSION REGARDING THIS BILL AS TO WHO DOES THIS ACTUALLY AFFECT. AB TWO TWENTIES MAIN FOCUS IS TO EXEMPT COLLECTOR CARS FROM THE SMALL CHECK THAT HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT CLUNKERS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT- ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIGHLY VALUABLE COLLECTOR CARS AB TWO TWENTY WAS NOT INTENDED TO BE A BLANKET EXEMPTION FOR ALL CARS MANUFACTURED BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN THE WORKS FOR BEING AMENDED TO REFLECT THAT. IF THIS BILL IS THE PASSED THIS COMMITTEE I AM WILLING TO ACCEPT ANY OTHER AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD. ESPECIALLY APPROPRIATIONS. BEFORE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT VEHICLES MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN SIXTY SIX MODEL YEAR WERE EXEMPT FROM THE SMALL CHECK PROGRAM. SB FORTY TWO. SENATOR CAPS. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN EXTENDED THE EXEMPTION TO ALL VEHICLES MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR MODEL YEAR ESTABLISHING A ROLE IN EXEMPTION. UNTIL AB. TWENTY SIX EIGHTY THREE SENATOR OR I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVER IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR REPEALED THE THIRTY YEAR ROLLING EXEMPTION AND INSTEAD EXEMPTED VEHICLES MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. SO WE USED TO HAVE A AUTOMATIC RULE LEAN EXEMPTION FOR THE COLLECTOR CARS THEN THEY FROZE IT. FOR NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. THIS LEGISLATION HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. SO AT THIS TIME WITH THE CHAIRS PERMISSION I WOULD NOW LIKE TO PASS IT ON THE BILL ADAMS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CAR CLUBS AND AFTER THAT I'D SAY A MAN DAY ALLSTATE INSURANCE BEFORE YOU DO THAT I DO WANT TO MAKE I WANT TO CLARIFY SOMETHING IN YOUR STATEMENT YOU SAID THAT THIS BILL. IS TO EXEMPT THE COLLECTOR CARS BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT YOUR BILL EXAMS ALL CARS BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE FROM SMOG CHECK NOT JUST COLLECTOR CARS I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL TAX AND IT SAYS ALL CAR IT'S ALL CARS SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT HERE IF YOU IF YOU ARE REPRESENTING THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT COLLECTOR CARS IT IS NOT IT MAKES CAPTURE THEM BUT IT IS ALL CARS BEFORE NINETY THREE I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT AND NOW LET'S GO TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HEY MY NAME'S BILL ADAMS WITH THE- ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CAR CLUBS AND COLLECTORS. WE FORMED A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE AUTOMOTIVE ENTHUSIAST AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO ALMOST FIFTY YEARS- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US AND- PUSHING THIS HEARING- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- IT AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THIS BILL WOULD- EXEMPTS COLLECTOR CARS- AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE IS SOME CONFUSION AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THIS. CONFUSION WHETHER IT'S TO AMEND IT FURTHER BUT- WE ARE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF A AT. A BILL EXEMPTING COLLECTOR CARS- THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS OF THE BILL AND PASSED BILLS OF A SIMILAR NATURE IT IS PAINTED A BROAD BRUSH OF ALL VEHICLES AND THE- SPECIFICALLY- ANYTHING IN EIGHT YEARS BUT WE WERE. ANYTHING THAT CALLED AS A COLLECTOR CAR WOULD BE VERY SPECIFIC AND COULD NOT SHOULD NOT BE PAINTED WITH SUCH A BROAD BRUSH- ALSO. LIST WOULD ALSO ALLOW A LOT OF OTHER YOUNGER ENTHUSIASTS TO BRING INTO- CAR SHOWS ARE CLUBS- A CROSS CAL. AND WEEKEND THERE'S A CAR SHOWS. AND GENERALLY WAS CAUTIOUSLY SUPPORTING SORT OF LOCAL. EVENTS A CHILD WITH THE- AND AILMENTS- IN SOME CASES SOME OF THEM HAD EVEN SUPPORTED SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THE SIERRA CLUB- WHICH IS INTERESTING BUT- THIS IS- THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW YOUNGER ENTHUSIASTS TO CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE THEIR HOBBY WHICH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS CLARIFIED IN MANY MANY CASES THAT IT IT HAS A- LARGE INTEREST IN. FURTHERING CAR COLLECTING AND THE CAR HOBBY WHICH IS- VERY ENDEMIC TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF YOU CAN FINISH UP YOUR COMMENTS PLEASE OR AT THE TWO MINUTE MARK. OKAY AND AGAIN THE A TRIPLE C. HAS BEEN REPRESENTING COLLECTOR CAR AND AUTOMOTIVE ENTHUSIAST SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO- AND WE ARE DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF EXEMPTING COLLECTOR CARS. AND THE YEARS- MENTIONED OKAY THANK YOU NEXT WE HAVE ISAIAH MANY FROM FARMERS INSURANCE I BELIEVE. BY KATHLEEN ONE TWO I'M HERE OKAY YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES PLEASE. OKAY THANK YOU AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP IT A TWO MINUTE DRIVE A LOT OF INFORMATION TO GO OVER- WHILE I AM APPOINTED THE FARMERS INSURANCE WE DON'T WRITE MOST POLICIES OF WHAT THE COLLECTOR CAR POLICIES WE ACTUALLY DON'T INSURE THROUGH THEM THERE ARE. ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE SPECIFICALLY COLLECTOR CAR INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT WE USED TO WRITE THESE VEHICLES BECAUSE JUST TO CLARIFY. THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT- I REPRESENT IS TRUMP COLLECTOR CARS IN OUTLOOK THROUGH THE REQUIREMENTS AND WHAT IT TAKES TO RUN- INSURE A COLLECTOR CAR VEHICLE. NOW WHEN I GET A NEW APPLE CAN'T. BEFORE I EVEN FILL OUT THE APPLICATION THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS THAT I USED TO BACK WHETHER OR NOT. THEY WOULD BE- A RIGHT FIT FOR SUBMISSION TO UNDERWRITING- THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS GOING TO BE. IF THEY HAVE A SECOND THEY HAVE A PRIMARY DAILY USE CAR SO THE COLLECTOR VEHICLE CAN'T BE USED ON A DAILY BASIS. AND UNDERWRITING IS VERY STRICT ABOUT THIS- YOU CAN'T BORROW YOUR WIFE'S CAR SOMEBODY ELSE'S CAR THAT YOU YOU LIVE WITH BECAUSE- THEY ACTUALLY REQUIRE THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER FOR. YOUR DAILY KERR AND ANYONE ELSE IN THE HOUSEHOLD THAT YOU LIVE WITH- SO WOULD THEY WE NEED TO PROVIDE DOCUMENTATION THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IN THE HOUSE AND THE CAR. BEFORE. YOUR COLLECTOR CAR CAN APPLY- ONE OF THE NEXT REQUIREMENT IS THE MILEAGE RESTRICTION. MOST OF THE COLLECTOR CAR COMPANIES ONLY ALLOW FOR A FEW THOUSAND MILES- THEY'RE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE IN THE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. AND A COMPANY THAT ARE RIGHT THE MOST WITH HIS- UPWARDS OF THREE THOUSAND MILES WHICH IS VERY LIMITING AND WITHIN THEIR HERDS DRASTICALLY- ONE OF THE- OTHER REQUIREMENTS. THAT DIFFICULT TO MEET HIS. TRUE COLLECTOR CARS MUST BE PARKED IN THIS IS A REQUIREMENT INSIDE OF IT ENCLOSED GARAGE WITH THE PORTAL CRUISER I'M GONNA STOP. STAR OF THE SUBJECT YOUR TIME IS UP AND I. WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE BILL DOES NOT REFER TO COLLECTOR CARS THE BILL IS REFERRING TO ALL CARS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. I HAD- HAD SUGGESTED SHOULD DEVELOP SHOULD THE AND WE DON'T SUPPORT ALL CARS. MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ONCE AGAIN OUR OUR DEMOGRAPHIC IS TRUE COLLECTOR CARS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD REQUEST THE BILL BE AMENDED IF IT WORKS TO BE VOTED FOR WORK OKAY THAT'S HELPFUL THANK YOU AND MAYBE HE WILL CONSIDER THAT BUT THAT IS NOT THE BILL THAT IS BEFORE US- WE NOW WILL MOVE TO THE OPPOSITION- WE HAVE- WILL BEAR. I BELIEVE FIRST TWO MINUTES PLEASE. AT ACTUALLY MANTIA BRANDON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION I WAS GONNA. GO FIRST IF YOU DON'T MIND THAT'S FINE TWO MINUTES PLEASE. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SPENDING TELECOM HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM ALL THIRTY FIVE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS IN OPPOSITION AT TEN TWENTY. WHICH EXEMPTS ALL CARS WITH MODEL YEAR NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EARLIER FROM SMOG CHECK. AUTOMOTIVE EMISSIONS ACCOUNT FOR OVER 50% OF SMOG FORMING POLLUTANTS IN CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S AN EQUITABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO CUT AIR POLLUTION WITHOUT REGULAR INSPECTIONS ARE SMOG CHECK VEHICLE EMISSIONS CONTROL SYSTEMS INTEGRATED OVER TIME- CAN BE CAPITALIST DRAMATICALLY INCREASING AIR POLLUTION. THE PROGRAMS ESSENTIAL FOR CLEAN AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR OLDER VEHICLES SUCH AS THOSE THIS BILL WOULD EXACT. COUNT A FAILURE RATE OF OVER TWENTY TWO PERCENT. UNDER THE PROGRAM FOR OLDER VEHICLES ARE NOT HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AS NEWER VEHICLES IN FACT I'M NOT EVEN HELD TO THE EMISSION STANDARDS THEY ACHIEVED WHEN THEY WERE NEW. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE PROGRAM TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION FACTORS SUCH AS THE AGE MAKE AND MODEL OF THE VEHICLE AND ALLOWS FOR THE EXPECTED DETERIORATION OF THE VEHICLES EMISSIONS CONTROLS OVER TIME. HELLO RESOURCES BOARD DATA SHOWS THAT KNOCKS EMISSIONS FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO PASSENGER CAR WHICH WOULD BE NEARLY EXEMPT UNDER THE BILL IS APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY FOUR TIMES THE RUNNING EXACERBATE. OF THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN MODEL YEAR PASSENGER CAR AND WITHOUT SMOG CHECK THAT NUMBER GOES UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE TIMES SO. PLEASE MENTION THAT OBVIOUS MAINTAIN THEIR VEHICLES- OR THAT ACTUALLY LOWER MILEAGE LIMITATIONS AS MAYBE A FEW THOUSAND MILES A YEAR- BUT IT AT THREE THOUSAND MILES A YEAR. EIGHTY FOUR TIMES MORE KNOCKS EMISSIONS THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF A TWENTY SEVENTEEN PASSENGER CAR DRIVING TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO THOUSAND MILES A YEAR. AND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY ONE TIMES IT'S THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE THOUSAND MILES SO IF YOU PUSH THAT OUT. TO NINE THOUSAND MILES BRINGING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EQIPMENT IN OF ONE POINT ONE. MY TO THINK ABOUT THIS ANOTHER WAY. FROM THE KNOX IN. STAND PASSING THIS BILL WOULD RESULT IN ADDING OF HIS MILLION. TWENTY SO. CAUSED THE REST- YOU KNOW I'LL I'LL JUST READ UP I GET WANT TO POINT OUT THAT SMALL CHECK ALSO A CONSUMERS. PROGRAM PROVIDES LOW INCOME ALONE BECAUSE COMING BY HIS BILL TO NINE FOR. AND ALSO INCOME CONDUCTORS FIFTY NINE YEARS TONIGHT VEHICLE SAY I RETIRED A KIND OF VEHICLE SO I JUST WANT THIS TO- EMISSION CONTROL. AND ON TO THE VIEW. AND WE THINK THIS OUT AND EFFECT ON HEALTH AND MAKE IT CONSIDER HARDER FOR CALIFORNIA NEEDED TO AIR GOALS ARE EXPECTS WE REQUEST YOUR. NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NO WITNESS PLEASE. HI GOOD AFTERNOON I'M WILL BEAR IT WITH THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY CAPCO AND DO THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS OF A ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE CLEAN AIR PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION IS ALSO OPPOSED TO EIGHTY TWO TWENTY. THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL SMOG CHECK PROGRAM IS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT ATTAINMENT OF HEALTH PROTECTIVE CLEAN AIR STANDARDS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS CRITICAL IF CALIFORNIA REMAINS HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST DIFFICULT AIR POLLUTION CHALLENGES IN THE UNITED STATES. MOSTLY DRIVEN BY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. TRY PUSHING BECAUSE OF AB ONE SECOND CHILDREN MAKE HOW THE WIDE RANGE OF OTHER HEALTH EFFECTS INCLUDING THE ONSET OF CHILDHOOD ASTHMA. IMPAIRED LUNG FUNCTION AND PREMATURE DEATH. CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE AS ARE THOSE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. MAJOR ROADWAYS. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR HEALTH PROTECTIVE AIR QUALITY STANDARDS CALIFORNIA MUST DO MORE NOT LESS TO CURB TRAFFIC POLLUTION. FOR THESE REASONS AND AGAIN AND THE STATE OF BY CAPCO WE ARE OPPOSED TO AB TWO TWENTY. WHICH WOULD ALLOW BROAD EXEMPTION FOR THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL AND HELP PROTECT ITS MARKET PROGRAMMING CALIFORNIA.

AN EXEMPTION FROM SMOG CHECK HAS SUB MY COLLEAGUE BRENDAN TO IT TO IT MENTIONED WILL DRASTICALLY INCREASE AIR POLLUTION FROM THESE VEHICLE AND CURRENT ONE NOTHING IN SMOG CHECK PREVENTS CURRENT TVS FOR MAINTAINING AND SHOWING NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO VEHICLES AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE.

BY DOING A RAN OFF WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. WE GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER NAZARIAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I'M A BIT CONFUSED HERE HI I'M READING THE BILL AND IT SAYS THIS BILL INSTEAD WOULD EXEMPT FROM THE SMOG CHECK PROGRAM ALL MOTOR VEHICLES MANUFACTURED. HIGHER TO NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE MODEL YEAR. BUT WHEN I'M READING THE COMMITTEES AND ALICE'S. SAYS EXEMPTS COLLECTOR MOTOR VEHICLES FROM VISUAL OR FUNCTIONAL CHECK OF EMISSION CONTROL DEVICES INCLUDING THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND ON AND ON IT LIST THREE DIFFERENT AREAS. SUN A. N. AND OF COURSE I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID MISS MADAM CHAIR AND I'M HEARING WHAT. THE PRESENTER IS SAYING IS WELL THE AUTHOR IS SAYING. SO I'M JUST A BIT CONFUSED WHERE THERE AMENDMENTS INTRODUCED THAT WE'RE GONNA. LIMITED TO ONLY COLLECTOR CARS. NO THE BILL IS WRITTEN HIS BROAD AND IF AFFECTS ALL CARS BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE COLLECTOR CARS ALREADY HAVE A PATH FOR SMOG CHECK EXEMPTION IF THEY MEET CRITERIA OF BEING COLLECTOR CARS- SO I KNOW THAT pLIKE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ACHIEVE THAT STATUS WHICH WE ARE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK ON BUT THE BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY IS A BILL WHICH EXEMPTS ALL CARS. BEFORE NINETY THREE FROM SMOG CHECK NOT JUST COLLECTOR CARS THESE WOULD BE CARDS THAT PEOPLE DO USE AS THEIR PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW THESE ARE EXACTLY THE CARS THAT WERE TRYING TO GET OFF THE ROAD AS IT IS. WE TRIED TO WORK WITH I MEAN WE HAVE WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THE COLLECTOR CAR. CONCERN BUT THIS BILL- I CAN'T SUPPORT BECAUSE IT GOES FAR BEYOND THAT IS THAT YOUR QUESTION. IT IS I I'M JUST THE DISCREPANCY IS I'M I'M- TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT THANK. I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AND IN MY CONVERSATIONS WTH HIM ALSO I'VE LEARNED THAT THIS IS THIS APPLIES ONLY TO. COLLECTOR VEHICLES SON TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE DISCREPANCY IS I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY ASK- MY COMMITTEE STAFFER TO SPEAK TO WHETHER THERE WERE ABOUT THE AMENDMENT PROCESS- MAYBE SHE CAN GIVE US SOME CLARITY ON THAT. AND SORT OF WHERE THE DISCREPANCY LAWS HERE YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS BROADER THAN JUST ADDRESSING THE COLLECTOR CAR ISSUE. AND SO WE WOULD LIKE WE BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD NARROW IT TO JUST FOCUS ON THE COLLECTOR CAR ISSUE SO THERE ISN'T A BROADER SMOG EXEMPTION. DOES THAT ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION- IT TO SOME EXTENT AND YES AND NO BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO THE QUESTION OF WHAT HAPPENS TODAY BECAUSE I'M I'M JUST WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING COMMITTEE STAFF MANNER AT THIS POINT TO ALSO MAKE AMENDMENTS THAT HE CAN COMMIT TO THE CHAIR. MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION IF THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO NARROW THIS BILL AND TO ADDRESS THE COLLECTOR CAR CONCERNS. MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT WE NOT VOTE ON THIS BILL TODAY AND SAID WE CAN WORK WITH HIM ON THE BILL ON AMENDMENTS THAT HE WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE WOULD THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE COLLECTOR CAR COMMUNITY AND HELPFUL TO THEM. WE COULD TRY TO COME TO SOME AGREEMENT WITH THAT AND BRING IT BACK IN A FURTHER HEARING. SO THAT WE CAN ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE AND NONE OF US HERE I DON'T THINK LISA FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I. IF THE COLLECTOR CAR COMMUNITY IS HAVING. AN ISSUE OR CONCERN. I WOULD LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THAT AND SEE HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THAT WITH THE BILL THAT'S IN FRONT OF US TODAY GOES FAR BEYOND THAT AND I CAN NOT SUPPORT THAT BILL SO IF HE'S WILLING TO NOT TAKE A VOTE NOW WE CAN. HOLD THE BILL AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE BILL AND HOPEFULLY. COME TO SOME AGREEMENT WITH EVERYBODY. IF IT LEAKS WE CAN TRY- WE TAILOR MATHIS- AREA MANAGERS LIKE TO MOTION THAT THE COMMITTEE TABLE THE BILL INTEL OF FURTHER HEARING DATE TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE YOUR SUGGESTION AND AMEND THE BILL AND WORK WITH EVERYBODY TO- IT SEEMS LIKE HE HAS AN INTENT TO HAVE THIS JUST FOR THE COLLECTORS- SIDE JUST MAKING A MOTION FOR HIM TO BE ABLE TO TABLE BOTH THE BILL. AS FOR YOUR SUGGESTION- SO WE CAN BRING IT BACK AT A MATTED WITH THIS REGISTER MATHIS I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR MOTION I'M NOT SURE WE NEED A MOTION IF HE'S AGREEABLE TO JUST NOT PICKING UP- TODAY IN THE PHARMACY THE BIG THUMBS UP SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO ACTUALLY HAVE A VOTE WE WILL JUST NOT TAKE A TAKE ANY ACTION AT THIS TIME BUT WE DID HEAR THE WITNESSES TESTIMONY. AND WE I THINK WE HEAR THE COLLECTOR CAR COMMUNITY HAS SOME CONCERNS SO WE WILL SIT DOWN WITH YOU IN WITH THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONCERNS AND. AND FIND SOME PATH FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I WITH YOU A 100% AND- THE BILL WAS INTENDED TO SIMPLY. ADDRESS COLLECTOR CARS. AND IT WENT A LITTLE BIT SELF THERE'S SO WILL REDO IT AND MAKE IT GOOD MR VOEPEL I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING WITH US AND I PLEDGE TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT.
