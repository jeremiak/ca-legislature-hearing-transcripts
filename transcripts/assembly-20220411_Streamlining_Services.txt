S. IN ADDITION ON IN THIS PARTICULAR DATA SET THAT WE LOOK AT ROUGHLY FIVE PERCENT OF THE VICTIMS WERE REPORTEDLY TRAFFICKED FOR BOTH TAX AND LABOR ON IN TERMS OF THEIR COMPARISON AND INTERACTION BETWEEN THESE TWO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT CHILDREN THAT ARE TRAFFICKED FOR LABOUR MIGHT ALSO BE MORE VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL ABUSE EVEN AFTER NOT BEING -- COMMERCIAL THE TRAFFICKED OR EXPLOITED FOR THOSE PURPOSES JUST CERTAINLY ANY CHILD WHO'S BEING TRAFFICKED IS IN A VERY VULNERABLE SITUATION TO HAVE OTHER SHE HI WE WERE ASKED THE PENALTIES FOR CHILD TRAFFICKING WHAT ARE THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE HOLD PERPETRATORS AT THIS CRANE SO ON AND SO WHEN WE LOOK AT X.

AND AND NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMMITTING THAT CRIME DECLINE OR IT COULD JUST BE BECAUSE THE WAY THAT CHILD TRAFFICKING CHILD SEX TRAFFICKING SHE I WAS PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED I'M AND THEY'RE FAR LESS LIKELY AND I CAN DEFINITELY PLEASE CONTINUE WITH YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU YEAH AND IT COULD BE THEY THEY YOU KNOW THE CRIME HAPPENED ONCE OR COULD JUST BE THAT THEY WEREN'T LAST LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED AND THEN CONVICTED AND FIFTY AND I'M NOT MOVING TO THE NEXT BYE BYE NUMBER TWELVE I'M NOT IN THE ACTING NEEDED NUMBER AND EXPENSE AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN HAVE TO DECLINE OUT WE HAVE TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE CHURCH BOB THIS IS AGAIN GOING BACK TO THAT DATA FROM THE NATIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING HOTLINE AT THAT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S ENTERPRISE WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED HOW TRACKING THAT DOWN ACTIVATED BY THIS PARTICULAR BRAND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- THAT NUMBER WENT UP IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THEN DECLINE AND SO IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS OUT COMPARED TO THE LAST AND AND THAT IT'S NOT QUITE FOLLOWING THE SAME TREND AND AND SO IT'LL BE REALLY INTERESTING TO DATA FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IS NOT AVAILABLE YEAH IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF BACK FRIENDS BACKED OUT NO WAY THAT HARASSED IMPRISONED EMISSIONS HAVE OR WHETHER THE TREND IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS ALNA HAS SOME DIFFERENCES THERE IS MAYBE SOMEWHAT MORE INDEPENDENT IRAQ AND PRESENTATIONS OVERALL I REALLY THINK THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE THE TRANSMITTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION YOU WOULD HAVE A SENSE THAT OKAY WERE CONTINUALLY I'M ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING SUCCESSFULLY ROUGHLY THE SAME NUMBER OF ACTORS I THINK A PERSON OF INTEREST SH I'M TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN DEPEND LIVING REALLY DIFFERENTLY THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO REPLY TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY HE THOUGHT THAT HE THOUGHT WHAT IS GOING ON NOW IS NOT HAVE GREAT DATA OR DO WE HAVE A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY I'M IDENTIFYING AND ARRESTING AND PROSECUTING OFFENDERS SHE BY THIRTEEN AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE STATE AFFECT THEM COMPENSATION PROGRAM AND PROVIDING THAT RACKS REIMBURSED AND SO AS YOU CAN THANK HER AND FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THIS STATE HAS PROVIDED COMPENSATION TO ROUGHLY SIXTEEN OF CHILD TRAFFICKING ANNUALLY GOOD ACTORS THAT YOU KNOW ROUGHLY SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS AFTER I'M AND THEN IN THE RANGE OF SORT OF FIFTY OFFENDERS BEING PROSECUTED SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF SCALE AND THEN MOVING TO THE NEXT CHART YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CHILD TRAFFICKING VICTIMS I'M BEING IN THE LOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN TOTAL AND FOR THOSE ROUGHLY SIXTEEN EXTENDED TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND NINETEEN TWENTY AND THEN INCREASING ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND AND THE REASON FOR THIS CHANGE IS YOU PRETTY MUCH ENTIRELY TO THE FACT THAT I THESE VICTIMS ARE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR INCOME AND SUPPORT BLOCK THAT'S BEEN A VERY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOR THESE VICTIMS IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE OPPOSITION PROGRAM CASH NOW MOVING ON AND WITH WHAT IMPACT ON THE PANDEMIC I TELL TRAFFIC AND THE UNITED NATIONS HAS PUT OUT A REPORT ON GLOBAL LEVY AFFECTS I'M CAL TRAFFICKING AND WHAT THEY FOUND IS THAT REALLY TRAFFIC PERSON HAVE TO DO I THINK OUR SUPPORT CREATING AS WELL AS THE METHODS AND MEANS OF EXPLOITATION THIS REPORT ALSO FOUND THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CHANGES THAT'S INSANE I'M AND AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY AM AND INITIALLY IT DOWN IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO EXPAND THROUGH NOT YOU NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS MENTAL MENTAL HEALTH APPOINTMENTS THINGS LIKE THAT I'M AND EVEN POTENTIALLY SERVICES THAT MIGHT HAVE HELPED IDENTIFY AND THAT THEY WERE AND HELP GET THEM OUT OF THE TRAFFICKING SITUATION I'M LOOKING AT THE STATE LEVEL AND I'M TWENTY AS FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN BY THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR AGREED TO CONSOLIDATE THE STATE'S VICTIMS PROGRAMS INTO IN YOUR DEPARTMENT OKAY ONLY ON PROVIDING SERVICES TO EXTENSIVE SHOULD INCLUDE CHILD TRAFFICKING ON THE AND THE GOAL WOULD BE TO INCREASE SERVICE LEVELS AND IMPROVE COORDINATION AND THEY SAID THERE'S MANY PROGRAMS AT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES THEY NEED PROGRAM THE SIMPLE CHECK IT OUT AND SO I HAVE SEEN PROGRAMS FOR CONSOLIDATED INTO THIS NEW DEPARTMENT HOWEVER BECAUSE MANY OF THE PROGRAM OFFICERS ARE WORKING WITH THE THIRD PERSON IN THE BAND FIFTY RESPONDING TO COOK THE PERFECT THE CONSOLIDATION OF THESE PROGRAMS HAS NOW BEEN I'M CLEAR AT THIS POINT WHEN ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OPPOSING THE SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT CONSOLIDATION YEAH WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND CONTINUE TO I REQUEST INFORMATION FROM THE MINISTRATION AS TO WHEN THAT CONSOLIDATION WILL OCCUR THE LAST FLIGHT HI LIKE SIXTEEN OF THE PRESENTATION RIGHT I'M AT THE THAT TIME DEFENDING ARE WE AND THE THING AND CONSOLIDATION CAN REVIEW SOME OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR PROVIDERS MANY OF THE GRANT PROGRAM FOR VERY SMALL AND HAVE DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS AND THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO CONSOLIDATE OR STREAMLINED THAT -- STREAMLINING ACT THAT'S THE CORRECT ANSWER PROVIDERS ARE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT CONSOLIDATING THIS COULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE STATE THE AMOUNT THAT THE STATE BANS ON CERTAIN ELIGIBLE VICTIM SERVICES AND CAN HE MATCHED BY THE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND SO IT'S LIKELY THAT PEOPLE LEAVING SOME FEDERAL DOLLARS AND AND WE JUST PROVIDE OF PROVING EIGHT WHICH THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND PURSUING I DIE IN THE END OF MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISS PETERS AND WE WILL NOW

WHEN WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT CHILD LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AS WELL AS I MENTIONED THEY MAY FALL WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE COLLECTION ABUSE BUT THAT DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY INDICATE A MANDATED REPORTER AND THEN THOSE YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO -- THE RESOURCES THAT COME THROUGH SYSTEMS LIKE THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM LOOKING FORWARD WE HOPE THAT BUILDING CAN BE DONE AROUND AND LOOKING AT SOCIETY'S BIAS SEES AND AND TRYING TO YOU KNOW CREATE SOME VISIBILITY FOR GROUPS OF SURVIVORS AND WE NEED TO SHIFT BACK THROUGH EDUCATION -- AND WE NEED TO SHIFT BACK THROUGH THE SPREAD OF RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND FOR ALL GROUPS AND POPULATIONS TO REVERSE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU MISTER OBSERVATION TESTIMONY AND AGAIN FOR TIME'S SAKE I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS BUT I REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE ESPECIALLY THE PANELS TO -- REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE COMMUNICATOR ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE DURING COLDER NINETEEN AND RESOURCES BUT ALSO WHAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO REALLY EXPAND AND IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT AND WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE A CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S TRAFFICKING OF OUR CHILDREN SO PLEASE REACH OUT IN THAT AREA I DO WANT TO BRING UP SOME THINGS THAT STOOD OUT FROM THIS PANEL AND -- MIST -- TREADWELL AND STARTED OFF THE PANEL AND MAY I ALLUDED TO THIS -- INFORMATION ABOUT NOT JUST THE MISSING DATA BUT TAKING DATA AND PUTTING IT TOGETHER TO WORK ACTUALLY IS IS A WORKABLE -- TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT GOING AND GETTING A JUST A BUNCH OF INFORMATION BUT IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING INFORMATION IN A CONSISTENT WAY TO WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET THE MESSAGE THAT WE NEED AND ARE ABLE TO CREATE TOOLS FROM THAT DATA THAT IS COLLECTED AND THEN ALSO WHAT I WAS INSPIRED BY WHAT APPEARS TO BE A THEME FROM ONE PANEL TO ANOTHER AT LEAST ONE OF THE THEMES AND THAT WAS MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR AGENCIES AND FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE AND BRING THINGS TOGETHER WHICH LEADS ME TO THE GOOD WORK OF DIGNITY AND AND THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHAT I HOPE FOR IS THAT -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CATCHES THE ATTENTION OF ALL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD REALLY BE INTERESTED TO HEAR IS THERE A CONCERN OF EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE -- BETWEEN HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY -- DIGNITY AS AS -- AS GREAT OF A WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING -- YOUR RESOURCES ARE LIMITED SO TO BE ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY DOING -- COLLECTING DATA IN A CONSISTENT WAY BUT WE'RE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE IN A CONSISTENT WAY AS WELL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE AND I WAS -- REALLY SPEND KNOWN OR UNDERSTOOD BUT PANEL ABOUT BEING PROACTIVE AND NOT WAITING FOR VICTIMS TO COME OUT AND AND GET HELP BUT ACTUALLY SEARCHING OUT THOSE VICTIMS WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE WE KNOW AT LEAST IT MAY BE AT A TOTAL -- IN A SCIENTIFIC SENSE BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF VICTIMS OUT THERE THAT ARE NOT REPORTING THAT ARE NOT COMING OUT AND AND SEEKING THE HELP THAT THEY NEED BUT THEY HOLD THEM FOR A LIFETIME AND IT ALWAYS MANIFEST IN OTHER WAYS AND LIFE SO WITH THAT I INTERESTING THAT ONE OF THOSE STARTING POINTS IS ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO HOMELESS YOUTH FINDING THE HOMELESS YOUTH ON THE STREETS AND THEM MAKING SERVICES AVAILABLE AND TO WHERE THEY ACTUALLY BEGAN TO BUILD SOMETHING THEY'VE NEVER EXPANSION FOR THAT STRESSED AND THEIR LIFE AND TRUST HEELS AND TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IT OPENS UP THINGS AS WELL MORE THAN TO BE ABLE TO HEAL AND THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY BROUGHT A LOT OF CONCERN TO ME IS THAT I THINK I'M HEARING A MESSAGE THAT'S REALLY RESOUNDING AND THAT IS IN MANY CASES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REALLY THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE TO DEAL WITH YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THIS CRISIS IS THROUGH OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM AND ARE YOUTH ARE ARE ARE USED JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THAT HAS BECOME KIND OF THE THE LANDING SPOT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE STRUGGLE YEAH AND AND AND RESOURCES AND OTHER OTHER AREAS SO IF IF THERE IS A FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER OR THERE IS A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR OR THEY ARE CAUGHT OUT ON THE STREETS AND HIT A HOMELESS SITUATION AND THOSE RESOURCES ARE LACKING OR THE LACK OF EDUCATION TO WHATEVER AGENCY IS FINDING THEM THEY JUST END UP GETTING PUT INTO A PIPELINE OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND THEN WE REALLY LOSE AT THAT POINT SO WITH THAT I DO WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR YOUR REALLY REALLY GREAT TESTIMONY ALONG WITH THE OTHER PANELS WE ARE GOING TO MOVE TO THE NEXT PANEL SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK MISTRETTA WELLNESS BUT STROKES DR DAVIS MR JOHNSON AND ALSO MISSED JOBS DONE FOR YOUR WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING ON BEHALF OF SURVIVORS OF CHILD TRAFFICKING I WOULD ALSO LIKE NOW TO INVITE OUR FINAL PANEL TO THE DIASPORA ACTUALLY IN THIS CASE REMOTELY IT WOULD BE FEDERAL DOLLARS CHAIRMAN OF LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION IT WOULD ALSO INCLUDE LEAVE LACHAPELLE ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF SURVIVAL -- SURVIVOR ADVOCACY THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING KATE WALKER BROWN SENIOR DIRECTOR COLLABORATIVE RESPONSES TO COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INITIATIVE THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW AND ALSO LESLIE STAR HI MOM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA THIS PANEL WILL EXPLORE THE STRATEGIES RECOMMEND AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN ORDER TO STREAMLINE SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS AND VICTIMS OF CHILD TRAFFICKING WE WILL BEGIN WITH PEDROZA NOT YES GOOD MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME I CAN PLEASE PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO -- TO TESTIFIED TODAY I'M GOOD OR NOT BUT I'M NOT SURE OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF STATE GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY TWENTY WE ISSUED THREE REPORTS EXAMINING CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING OUR DECISION TO FOCUS ON LABOR TRAFFICKING STEM FROM THE FACT THAT EXISTING EFFORTS TO COMBAT HUMAN TRAFFICKING PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON SEX TRAFFICKING SO MANY EXPERTS SUGGESTED LABOR TRAFFICKING IS MORE PREVALENT WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT EXISTING NUMBERS AGAINST SEX TRAFFICKING MUST CONTINUE BUT THERE MUST ALSO BE AN INCREASED FOCUS ON LABOR TRAFFICKING TRAGICALLY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS FALL PREY TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING EACH YEAR INCLUDING HUNDREDS WHO ARE EXPLOITED FOR THE VALUE OF THEIR LABOR THE COMMISSION STUDY CONCLUDED AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC UNLESS WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON THE PANDEMIC'S IMPACT ON TRAFFICKING RATES BUT WE DO KNOW THE TRAFFICKERS TARGET THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US WOULD BE PROTECTED DAY MANY OF WHOM ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE COLD NINETEEN PANDEMIC SH NATIONAL DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS NOT A SINGLE TYPE OF LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS TRAFFICKERS PREY ON INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF GENDER AGE OR CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT RUN AWAY FROM HOMELESS USE AS WELL AS FOSTER CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THIS EXPLOITATION ONE STUDY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AMONG HOMELESS YOUTH AGE SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE IN TEN CITIES INCLUDING LOS ANGELES AND OAKLAND FOUNDED EIGHT PERCENT OF THE YOUTH HAD BEEN VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING THESE TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTHS WERE FORCED TO WORK IN FACTORIES AGRICULTURE INTERNATIONAL DRUG SMUGGLING COMMISSION BASED SALES OR DOMESTIC SERVITUDE SOME ALSO EXPERIENCE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION LABOR TRAFFICKING CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DETECT IT CAN BE HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT OFTEN WITHIN BUSINESSES OR INDUSTRIES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE LEGITIMATE LABOR TRAFFICKING IS AT TIMES CONFLATED WITH LABOR EXPLOITATION WHICH BOTH OCCUR ON A SPECTRUM OF THE PEWS AND OF ALL THE PLAYERS WHO PROFIT FROM THE ILLEGAL TREATMENT OF WORKERS HOWEVER LABOR TRAFFICKING OCCURS WHEN EMPLOYEES EXTERNAL LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THE WORKERS AT LEAST AND TRACKED IN THE SITUATION TO FIND AND PROSECUTE LABOR TRAFFICKING AUTHORITIES OFTEN NEED TO BE FAMILIAR WITH THE UNDERLYING ELEMENTS OF LABOR EXPLOITATION YEAH LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE LARGELY UNFAMILIAR WITH THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT A LABOR TRAFFICKING CRIMES THIS LACK OF TRAINING MAY MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO DISMISS LABOR TRAFFICKING AS AN EMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND LAST WEEK IT HARDER TO UNCOVER SHE TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS CAN ACCESS HELP FROM A PATCHWORK OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA OFFERS A NUMBER OF SUPPORT SERVICES TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS PRIMARILY TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION BOARD IN ADDITION THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE SERVICE PROVIDERS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHO RECEIVE MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TWENTY THREE POINT TWO MILLION CUMULATIVELY FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING VICTIMS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SERVICES AVAILABLE TO HELP LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS THE COMMISSION ALSO IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR SURVIVORS ACCESS HELP NUMBER ONE SURVIVORS NEED A RANGE OF SUPPORT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS SAY WHICH PROGRAMS ARE MOST OF OUR MOST AFFECTED AND HOW THEY ARE BEST DELIVERED IN ADDITION IT IS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO FIND HELP THERE IS NO ONE STOP SHOP TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE NOW THE COMMISSION ALSO FOUND TOO FEW TRAFFICKERS ARE HELD FULLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ABUSES TRAFFICKERS FACE BOTH CRIMINAL AND CIVIL ACTION AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS FROM A VARIETY OF LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL ENTITIES YET DESPITE THE HUNDREDS OF KNOWN LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TO SEEK HELP EACH YEAR IN CALIFORNIA LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES THAT CAN BRING PERPETRATORS TO JUSTICE REMAIN RARE ON AVERAGE THERE ARE LESS THAN THIRTY CONVICTIONS FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING EACH YEAR IN THE STATE LESS THAN THIRTY LABOR TRAFFICKING IS DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE FOR NUMBER REASONS SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE IN PROSECUTIONS FOR EXAMPLE THEY MAY FEAR DEPORTATION OR RETRIBUTION INVESTIGATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY COSTLY TIME CONSUMING AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE REQUIRING BALL SPECIALIZED INVESTIGATORS OR RESEARCH NEW AREAS OF LAW THE CRIME CAN OCCUR EVEN WHEN THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF PHYSICAL FORCE OR VIOLENCE THIS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO PROVE IMPORTANT WE DON'T USE SOCIAL UNFORTUNATE ENOUGH IN EITHER LOCAL OR STATE COURSE AT THE STATE LEVEL DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WAS AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO PROSECUTE SINGLE HUMAN TRAFFICKING COMPLAINTS BUT THERE'VE BEEN NO PROSECUTIONS TODAY THE LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE EXPERIMENTING WITH USING CIVIL ACTION TO GO AFTER TRAFFICKERS THIS IS VERY INNOVATIVE BUT AS A STATE WE DON'T PRACTICE A LACK RESOURCES LIKE PUBLISHED CASE LAW IN TRAINING FOR PROSECUTORS TO USE STATE LAWS TO PURSUE LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES WE DON'T HAVE FORMAL AND WILL USE OR OTHER INFORMATION SHARING AGREEMENTS IN PLACE TO FOSTER ONGOING COORDINATION AMONG RELEVANT AGENCIES THAT WE HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN OUR REPORTS THE COMMISSION OFFERED SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP CALIFORNIA PREVENT TRAFFICKING HELP SURVIVORS AND ALL TRAFFICKERS ACCOUNTABLE INCLUDING CALIFORNIA SHOULD FORM AN ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING COUNCIL TO COORDINATE EFFORTS OF GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND NGOS AROUND FIGHTING ALL FORMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING STATE PRIORITIZE SERVICES FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVEYS SURVIVORS INCLUDE THANK IN SERVICE PROVISION TO LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVOR SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE POPULATION RESEARCHING AND EVALUATING THE EFFICACY OF SERVICE PROGRAMS AND CREATING A USER FRIENDLY DIRECTORY OF ALL RESOURCES FOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO FIND HELP LASTLY CALIFORNIA MUST ENHANCE ITS EFFORTS TO PROSECUTE TRAFFICKERS BY EMPOWERING MORE STATE AGENCIES TO LOOK FOR LABOR TRAFFICKING I THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WITH THE TOOLS AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO INVESTIGATE AND LITIGATE CASES I IMPROVING COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND BY STUDYING OUTCOMES OF LABOR TRAFFICKING CASES TO DETERMINE THE BEST PRACTICES THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ONCE IMPLEMENTED WILL STRENGTHENED CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE TO THIS HEINOUS CRIME I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER TESTIMONY AND TO JOIN THOSE THAT ARE ON THIS HEARING TODAY LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR -- THIS THIS PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS ALL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN NOT ALLOWED WE WILL NOW GO TO LEGALIZE FOR ABOUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME AND SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY MY NAME'S LEE LAST COUNT ON THE THIRTIETH RECTOR OF SURVIVOR ADVOCACY OF THE COALITION TO ABOLISH SLAVERY AND TRAFFICKING IN LOS ANGELES I SPENT MY ENTIRE CAREER WORKING ON THE FRONT LINES PROVIDING CRISIS RESPONSE TO ESCAPING SURVIVORS WELLS MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS LEADERS OF THE ANTI TRAFFICKING MOVEMENT CASSOULET IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH A MISSION TO ENSURE THAT HAVE THE KINGS EDUCATION COMPREHENSIVE LIKE TRANSFORMING SERVICES ADVOCACY A GROUNDBREAKING POLICIES AND SYSTEMIC CHANGE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WEEKS APART AT THOUSANDS OF SURVIVORS AND THEIR FAMILIES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN EMERGENCY SERVICES HOUSES SHUFFLING AND HEALTH SERVICES YOUTH PROGRAMMING ADVOCACY EDUCATIONAL AND LEADERSHIP TRAINING AND MENTORSHIP THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS IF ANY HELPING HAND HOW OUR SURVIVORS TO BECOME LEADING VOICES SHAPING POLICY AND PUBLIC WHERE IT'S BEEN MENTIONED ON THE CALL SEVERAL TIMES BUT WE WANT TO GO IT IS CRITICAL THAT STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADDRESSED THE LACK OF RELIABLE DATA ON THE PREVALENCE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IMPACTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF EQUITABLE POLICY AS WELL AS SERVICE PROVISION FOR SURVIVORS WE MUST ADDRESS THIS LACK OF DATA BY PRIORITIZING AND INVESTING IN PEER REVIEWED PUBLISHED STUDIES ON TRAFFICKING BETTER INFORMS BY SURVIVORS DURING BOTH PLANNING AND EXECUTION IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THAT ANTI TRAFFICKING LEGISLATION POLICIES AND PROGRAMS RECOGNIZE THE HEIGHTENED RISK THAT BY POCKET AND LGBTQ COMMUNITY SPACE I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HIGHER VULNERABILITIES TRACKING WE NEED TO THE U. S. NATIONAL COALITION FOR HOMELESS HOMELESS LGBTQ YOUTH ARE MUCH MORE VULNERABLE TO SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND TRAFFICKING COMPARED TO OTHER HOMELESS AND THEIR DATA THEY FOUND THAT TWENTY PERCENT OF HOMELESS YOUTH ARE LGBTQ IN THE UNITED STATES AND FIFTY EIGHT POINT SEVEN PERCENT OF THEM ARE EXPLOITED FOR SEX TRAFFICKING WHICH IS A MUCH HIGHER RATE THAN THE THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR PERCENT HETEROSEXUAL HOMELESS YOUTH THAT ARE AT RISK OF SEX TRAFFICKING HOWEVER ACCORDING TO UCLA'S DATA THANK YOU HOMELESS YOUTH ARE LARGELY UNDER REPORTED AND UNDER IDENTIFIED OUR SERVICES AND EXPERTS ADMIT THAT AT THE ESTIMATE YOU KNOW FORTY PERCENT MORE HOMELESS YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ RIGHT NOW IN THE ANTI TRAFFICKING WITHIN OUR CURRENT APPROACH INCREASED CRIMINALIZATION AND SURVEILLANCE OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAS NOT ONLY BEEN INEFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING TRAFFICKING OFTEN HARMFUL TO SURVIVORS CONDUCTED A SURVEY MANY YEARS AGO OUR NATIONAL SURVIVOR NETWORK WHERE OVER NINETY PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS REPORTED BEING ARRESTED AND HALF OF THEM BELIEVE THAT THEIR ARREST WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO TRAFFICKING AS A WIDESPREAD LACK OF AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF FORCED CRIMINALITY WHICH OCCURS WHEN SURVIVORS ARE FORCED BY THEIR TRAFFICKERS TO COMMIT CRIMES ARE FORCED TO ENGAGE AND CRIMINALIZED INDUSTRY WE MUST INCREASE OUR EDUCATION I'M FORCED CRIMINALITY AND ITS IMPACT ON SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY SURVIVORS OF COLOR TRAFFICKING IS A CRIME THAT AFFECTS SURVIVORS ALL IDENTITIES AGES AND NATIONALITIES EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF CLIENTS -- I CAST ARE BY TALK MEANING BLACK INDIGENOUS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND CURRENT CLIENTS WHO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT UNITIES ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED AND IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM EVEN AFTER LEAVING THEIR TRAFFICKING SITUATION A CRIMINAL RECORD CAN STILL FOLLOW IT IMPACT THE SERVICE LIFE FOR ME EVERY OTHER ASPECT OF IT IS REBUILDING INCLUDING DISQUALIFICATION FROM PUBLIC HOUSING WELFARE BENEFITS JOB TRAINING EMPLOYMENT AND IMMIGRATION RELIEF THE DENIAL OF THESE BASIC NECESSITIES FOR SURVIVAL CREATES THESE THAT CAN RESULT IN RACE TRACK THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY REASONS THAT WE MUST ADOPT A HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK AND ARCHITECTURE ASKING INITIATIVES WHERE AIM SHOULD ALWAYS BE TO INCREASE THE RIGHTS OF SURVIVORS AND PROTECT THEM FROM HARM WITHIN OUR CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM BY INVESTING IN NON CRYSTALLINE REGIONS SERVICES IT IS ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE UTILIZED A MULTI DISCIPLINARY PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO DRESS HUMAN TRAFFICKING REACTIVELY WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ONLY SHOW UP FOR SURVIVORS AFTER THE HARM TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING WILL NEVER BE ERADICATED IS WILL BE TO CREATE A RECORD RESOURCES TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN STARTS WITH PROACTIVELY PROTECTING PARENTS FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS FREE ACCESS TO HOUSING HEALTHCARE UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND STATE IMMIGRATION HOW MANY ANTI TRAFFICKING PREVENTION WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES DO NOT CAUSE HARM AND HARM ANTI TRAFFICKING POLICY REQUIRES ACTION ON SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUITIES HOMELESSNESS RACIAL DISPARITIES GENDER VIOLENCE HOMOPHOBIA ABLEISM IMMIGRATION ISSUES POLITICAL INSTABILITY ENVIRONMENTAL CRISES AND MORE ONE IN THREE PAST CLIENTS HAVE SURVIVED LABOR TRAFFICKING HUMAN TRAFFICKING MOVEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES LARGELY OVERLOOKED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO OUR CHILDREN UNDER CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE LAW WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE WORST DROUGHT IN COLLISION IT'S NOT A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF THE LABOR TRAFFICKING OF A MINOR BUT WE DO NOT APPLY THE SAME PRINCIPLE TO THE LABOR TRAFFICKING EXCUSE ME THIS IS NOT A NECESSARY COMPONENT IN THE SEX TRAFFICKING OF MINORS CURRENTLY COULD NOT APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE TO LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS WHERE WE REQUIRED BEFORE STRATA CORPORATIONS SIMILARLY IT LAWS PROHIBITING THE ARREST OF A TRAFFIC TO ENTER ONLY APPLY TO SEX TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS LEADING LABOR TRAFFICKING ESPECIALLY THOSE AND CRIMINALIZED ECONOMY AT RISK OF ARREST DEPORTATION SB SIX IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE PASSING HARBOR CONDITIONS SURE ALL CHILD TRAFFICKING VICTIMS TO ENSURE ALL IMPACTED THESE RECEIVED RESEARCH SAYS SHE SIXTY SIX PERCENT CAST CLIENTS WHO ARE FOREIGN NATIONALS WERE LABOR TRAFFICKING SURVIVORS TRYING NONPARTISAN UNDOCUMENTED SURVIVOR COMMUNITIES WE'VE LEARNED FROM THEM THAT WE NEED TO EXPEDITE ACCESS TO WORK AUTHORIZATION IN IMMIGRATION COURT TO ALLOW SURVIVORS TO TRACK NINETY SEVEN PERCENT ALL OF CALIFORNIANS ARE HOMELESS TWENTY START ANY SERVICE WITH US SURE MY CLIENT HAS TAKEN UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY PERCENT LONGER THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC DID INCREASED HOUSING SOCIAL SUPPORT AND MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE'VE ALSO INCREASED OUR SPENDING ON CLIENT NEEDS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC EVEN THOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN FUNDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING SPECIFIC SERVICES IT IS NOT ENOUGH SUPPORTING SURVIVORS OF TRAFFICKING REQUIRES MUCH MORE THAN SHORT TERM CRISIS INTERVENTION FUNDING IS NEEDED TO SUSTAIN LONG TERM PROGRAMS THAT OUR COMMUNITY LET LOW BARRIER AND GROUNDED IN HARM REDUCTION PRINCIPLES CALIFORNIA'S ENSURE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE CHILD CARE AND EDUCATION ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL MAGICALLY INCREASE EFFORTS TO REFORM THE CHILD CARE SYSTEM TO FOCUS ON SUPPORTING FAMILIES ELIMINATE DISCRIMINATION REFORM POLICING ENACT COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION WE MUST ENSURE JUSTICE FOR ALL SURVIVORS TACKLE THE ROOT CAUSES OF TRAFFICKING GUARANTEED THE RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS ARE TRAFFICKED PERSONS RESPECT INDIVIDUAL PTOLEMY AND MITIGATE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS THE ARREST AND DEPORTATION AND DETENTION WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR POLICIES HOLISTICALLY CARE FOR SURVIVORS AND ONLY THAT ITS TRAUMA INFORMED EVIDENCE BASED AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SURVEILLANCE ON BEHALF OF CASTELLATED AND AND THE SURVIVOR COMMUNITY I THANK YOU FOR YOUR INVITATION TO SHARE EXPERTISE OUR EXPERTISE AND TO OUR LARGER COMMUNITY WHO IS HERE TODAY THIS LISTING FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO YOU SURVIVORS AND WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM KATE WALKER BROWN SENIOR DIRECTOR COLLABORATIVE RESPONSES TO COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION AND MISSION TO HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY ARMS MY NAME IS KATE WALKER BROWN A SHEER PROGRAMS AND THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW WEARING BEAT THE COLLABORATIVE RESPONSES COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION INITIATIVE THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW HAS BEEN ADVOCATING FOR AND WHICH USED FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS MY TEAM WORKS TO ELIMINATE THE COMMERCIAL SEXUAL EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN YOU BY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE YOU CENTER RESPONSES TO SCORE YOU CAN DAMAGE TO THE STATE TO HEAL AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BIGGEST LOS ANGELES AZULES WALL STREET BENITO RURAL AND URBAN RESOURCE REGION NOT TO TRANSPORT AWAITING IDENTIFYING RESPOND YOU THE IMPACT OF EXPLOITATION IT MAKES TRIED REPORTING AND IMPACT RIGHT EXPLICATION AND YET STILL MUCH MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE OKAY TRYING SOME OF THE KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR WORK FIRST COLLABORATION THE STATE AS YOU HEARD FROM CHERYL AND OTHERS HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE STATE PROGRAM WHICH ENCOURAGES THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY CROWD COLLABORATION ACROSS THE FIVE COUNTY ONGOING FUNDING TO SUPPORT FAMILY WE HAVE SEEN THIS COLLABORATION WORKING COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THANK YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL THE IMPACT OF THAT OF THAT COLLABORATION WE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM USE THAT THEY FEEL I THINK THE TEAM BEHIND WORKING TOGETHER SO THAT THEY'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND THE YOUNG PEOPLE ALSO -- ARE SEEN FOR WHO THEY ARE AND NOT JUST THEIR EXPLOITATION COLLABORATION IS ALSO SUPER IMPORTANT AND THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT NOT ONE AGENCY OR OR SINGLE AGENT PEAK TO ME I'VE GOT A PERSONAL AND THAT THEY NEED TO WORK ACROSS SYSTEMS JUST AREN'T BEGUN PEOPLE AND THAT FAMILY CAREGIVERS THE SECOND COLLABORATION NEED TO CONTINUE TO BE BUILT OUT TO MAKE SURE THE INVOLVED COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS SO THAT WE DO NOT OVER RELY ON PUBLIC SYSTEMS WE NEED TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT YOUTH AND FAMILIES WITHOUT HAVING TO SEPARATE CHILDREN FROM THEIR FAMILIES EXAMPLE IF A YOUNG PERSON AT RISK FOR EXPLOITATION THAT PANELING OR NOT MOM OR DAD MIGHT NEED SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND COUNSELING RATHER THAN SIMPLY CHOOSING TO FILE ON THE FAMILY AND REMOVED THE CHILD FROM THEIR CARE THE COLLABORATION OF SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTFUL SERVICES ARE THE COMMUNITY BASED ADVOCATE THEIR SEPARATE FROM PUBLIC SYSTEMS BETTER WORKING TOGETHER WITH PUBLIC FUNDS TO SUPPORT FAMILIES AS WE REIMAGINE THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM FUNDING AND CAPACITY BUILDING COMMUNITY BASED GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATION MUST BE RIGHT OR TIES TO TO WORK EFFECTIVELY EVERYONE NEEDS TO SHARE COLLECTIVE MIND I MEAN WE ARE ENCOURAGING ALL PARTNERS TO UTILIZE A HARM REDUCTION APPROACH AS WAS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM CAST ROACH PRIORITIZE PRIORITIZE IS PROVIDING THE YOU FOR THE INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO SERVICES TO PROMOTE LONG TERM STATE TAKE ALL RECOGNIZING THAT THE YOUNG PERSON TO GO MAY BE INVOLVED IN EXPLAINED THE SITUATION IT RECOGNIZES THAT ACT I GET FROM EXPLOITATION OF NONLINEAR NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAN PORK FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU BECAUSE RIGHT AWAY WE CAN INSURE IT WE ENSURE THAT THEY WILL STILL ACCESS MEDICAL CARE OR THAT THEY KNOW WHO ON YOUR TEAM THEY CAN CALL AND REACH OUT TO TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY FUNDS SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN MORE COMFORTABLE UTILIZING THIS APPROACH ALL SYSTEM COMMUNITY PARTNERS GET NEED TO GET ON BOARD TO PROMOTE THIS SORT OF LONG TERM CP THIS REQUIRES FUNDING -- AND AND WE AS AS CHERYL MENTIONED PDFS IS PROMOTING GUIDANCE AROUND THAT AND WE NEED OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND COUNTY AGENCIES TO ADOPT A COCKROACH I ALSO ECHO THE COMMENTS AROUND CRIMINALISATION -- AS YOU NOTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON WE UNLESS WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES HE USED AND USEFUL BECOME INVOLVED IN IT JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM FORTUNATELY WE NO LONGER REST KID CAN CALIFORNIA FOR PROSTITUTION AND WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS MORE SERVICE BIG MODEL THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE CRIMINALIZATION HOWEVER KIDS ARE STILL ENDING UP IN DETENTION BOTH RELATED AND UNRELATED TO THEIR EXPLOITATION WE MUST BUILD COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WHEN WE ARREST AND DETAIN WE STILL HEAR THAT PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE ONLY WAY TO KEEP A YOUNG PERSON OKAY BUT WE ARE CLICKING TRAUMA ON THE YOUNG PERSON AND SADDLING THEM WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEM FOR YEARS TO COME UNLESS WE TRULY BUILD OUT COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN ON THE CRUTCHES INCARCERATION WE WE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR YOU PAUL ALONG WITH HER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE LOOKING WASTE

SOLUTIONS WE HEAR FROM KIDS ALL THE TIME THAT THEY WANT STAFF MEMBERS FROM CLINICIANS DOCTORS LAWYERS TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCES THE BATTLE CARE BEST WAY TO DO THAT IF THE HIGHER WITH EXPERIENCE WORKING SURVIVORS INTO RUSSIA BOB CAN DO THAT WE MUST REMOVE SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE -- RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT WHITE CRIMINAL RECORDS -- AND WE ALSO IN HIRING SIR SURVIVORS NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT ARE SO MUCH MORE THAN THEIR EXPERIENCE AND BRING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SKILLS SKILLS AND EXPERTISE THAT NEED TO BE RECOGNIZED YES WE ALL WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BE LISTENING TO YOUNG PEOPLE IT SEEMS OBVIOUS BUT IT'S NOT ROUTINELY HAPPENING WE GET RESERVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO IN L. A.

SHARING IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR GOVERNMENT -- MISTER BALL EARLY ON IN THE HEARING SPOKE ABOUT SHE ANY CHANGES WITH YOUR CHILD AND FAMILY LEAD AND WHILE THAT CONTACTED HIM TO THE CHILD AND FAMILY LED THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT POWER IMBALANCE THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE CHILD AND FAMILY TO ALWAYS BE ACTORS PORTRAYED AND OFTEN DOES NOT RESULT -- IN INVESTING THEY NEED BEING PROVIDED BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT FOR AGENCIES TO EITHER THEM OR TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON EVERY QUESTION THEY DON'T FIT WITHIN ESTABLISHED AND TRADITIONAL POLICIES AND REGULATIONS WHILE SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE AND THE PATHS TO ACCESSING SERVICES AND CONFUSING OVERLY COMPLICATED SCHEME STEP MARKING GRAYSON DOOR OPENERS UNLIKE THE NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH CHILDREN FAMILY ADVOCATES ANYTHING COUNTY SOCIAL WORKERS OFTEN FIND THAT EVERY DOORS LOCKED DOOR WHAT IS PERHAPS MOST FRUSTRATING IS THAT WHEN WE DO GO UP THE CHAIN THERE IS AN ANSWER SERVICES ARE IDENTIFIED PROVIDED FUNDED EXTENT WHY IS THAT PRICE TRADING BECAUSE IT TAKE THERE ARE STILL MANY HURDLES TO GET THERE BECAUSE OVERWHELMING BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG TO RESOLVE THESE BARRIERS THAT WE OFTEN END UP BACK AT

SOME SUGGESTIONS OTHERS HAVE ALSO MADE SOME SUGGESTIONS AS WELL BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HEAR WHAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD DO TO ASSIST SURVIVORS OF TRAFFICKING AND IN COMBINATION WITH THAT WHAT WAYS CAN WE CREATE A STATE WIDE COORDINATED BECAUSE I AM OFFERING AB TWO FIVE FIVE THREE IT'S -- HUMAN TRAFFICKING BILL THAT ADDRESSES MULTI DISCIPLINARY HUMAN TRAFFICKING COUNCIL THE CREATION OF THAT COUNCIL WHICH CALIFORNIA'S PROVEN TO BE BEHIND ON AS FAR AS A DEVELOPMENT THAT COUNCIL SO BRING IN THAT TO -- BRINGING THAT TO FRUITION IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME -- BASED ON SOME COMMENTS THAT CAME FROM THIS PARTICULAR PANEL IT JUST MAKES ONE WONDER HOW MUCH OF THIS CRISIS COULD BE AVOIDED BY JUST TAKING TIME TO LISTEN TO YOUNG VOICES PRIOR TO THE TRAUMA THAT EXPLOIT -- THAT EXPLOITATION IN KERR'S AND JUST -- WE TALK ABOUT RESPONDING TO SURVIVOR OR RESPONDING TO VICTIMS WE TALK ABOUT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS RESTORATION AND JUSTICE AND ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS BUT -- AS AS IT GOES BACK TO THAT OLD SAYING AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN A POUND OF CURE AND REALLY IT'S INCUMBENT ON OUR SOCIETY IT'S INCUMBENT UPON ALL OF US AS A COMMUNITY TO STOP SLOW DOWN PAY ATTENTION TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND LISTEN AND THAT NOT SO MUCH DICTATE OR OR ALWAYS JUST ADDRESS THE BAD OR ADVERSE BEHAVIOR BUT MAYBE THERE'S A CAUSE OR REASON TO THAT BAD OR ADVERSE BEHAVIOR AND TO GET DOWN TO THE ROOT OF IT AND ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THEIR VOICES AS LEGITIMATE VOICES AS VOICES THAT MATTER AND THEN THE POWER SHARING PART OF THAT GOVERNMENT ISN'T REALLY GOOD AT AND -- BUT MAYBE THE COMMUNITY CAN BE AND AND BE THE ADVOCATE FOR THAT VOICE PRIOR TO EXPLOITATION I DO WANT TO THANK SHERMAN -- NAVA AND ALSO LEAD LEISURE PAL MS BROWN AND MS HI MOM FOR YOUR REALLY INCREDIBLE WORK AND THE ADVOCACY THAT YOU'RE
