THE CALL RIGHT PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION WE ARE THE SPONSORS OF AB THREE SIX THREE AND ARE HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. THIS BILL IS ONE PIECE OF A LARGER ON GOING CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR A BEER TERM STRATEGY TO ACHIEVE GREATER EMISSION REDUCTIONS TODAY. THE BILL LAYS OUT A FRAMEWORK THAT REMOVES THE BARRIERS AND PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY. A NEW CAR MORE YOUR V. I. P. PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE THE BROADER DEPLOYMENT OF LOW NOT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS WHICH ARE NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF ANY NEAR TERM EMISSION REDUCTION STRATEGY. THIS IS BECAUSE LOW NOT HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE 90% CLEANER THAN THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS. THEY ARE COST EFFECTIVE OPTION IN COMPARISON. THEY ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TODAY AND CAN BE CARBON NEGATIVE WITH FUELED BY RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS. AS WE GET COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RIGHTLY POINTS OUT WE NEED TO GET HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD TODAY IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE GREATER GHG AND CRITERIA POLLUTANT REDUCTIONS AND TO PROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND SPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE LIVING HERE GOOD TO MOVEMENT CORRIDORS AND IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES.

AND WE BELIEVE THAT- THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS OF HAVING IMMEDIATELY DEPLOYABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT HELPS GET US THERE AS- EMPHASIZED BY REGIONAL AIR DISTRICTS- BOTH IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF STATE AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AS WELL. PROBABLY INDICATE THAT THIS IS A PART OF A STRATEGY THAT THE REGIONAL- AIR REGULATORS ON THE GROUND VERY MUCH WANT WITH RESPECT YOU- TOOLS IN OUR TOOL KIT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. FROM MOBILE SOURCES OF THE WESTERN PROGRAMMING GAS ASSOCIATION AND VOLUNTARY EVEN THOUGH ARE OUT OF GAS WHICH IS THE PRODUCT THAT PROPANE OFFERS. HE DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE FOOTPRINT BUT THEY'RE OUR FLEET OPERATORS THAT DO USE- CONVERSION KITS TO HAVE THEIR FLEET VEHICLES RUN ON THIS CLEAN FUEL. WE ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT. VERY SOON- THE PRODUCTION OF RENEWABLE PROPANE WILL BECOME A REALITY. IN THE UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL AND RENEWABLE PROPANE HAS.

MR WITH YOU AND TAYLOR. GOOD MORNING MR CHEN MEMBERS TAYLOR RUSSIAN WITH A CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE LEAH AND A COALITION OF AG AND BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE TWENTY FOUR UNLESS IT'S AMENDED I LIKE GOING TO BE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ON THE AMENDMENTS AND MYSTERY THIS HAPPENS ALONG WITH HIS STAFF- WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS OUR CONCERNS. THE MEN TO REFLECT PROGRESS BUT WE STILL FEEL THEIR SEVERAL PROVISIONS THAT ARE MISSING FROM THE BILL SPECIFICALLY IN DIRECTING AND FRAMING CARBS GOAL SETTING ACTION FIRST AS WE MENTIONED IN THE CASE FOR ALL OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND NATURAL WORKING LANDS CLIMATE SMART- GOAL SHOULD REALLY BE CRAFTED BASED ON WHAT'S ECONOMICALLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY FEASIBLE ESPECIALLY FOR THE WORKING LAND SECTOR WHAT AGRA NAMIK LEE FEASIBLE WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT CONSIDERING. THE DRAMATIC CHANGES WE'LL SEE IN LAND USE PATTERNS AND CROP DIVERSITY AND CERTAINLY WATER SCARCITY WITHOUT THAT CRITERIA BE INCLUDED ADDITIONALLY THE BILL FAILS TO DIRECT CARPETS IN A CLINICAL PREDICATED ON WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED THROUGH VOLUNTARY ACTION BY PRIVATE AND NATIONAL WORKING LANDHOLDERS NOT ONLY ARE THEY PREDOMINATELY NOT COVERED ENTITIES UNDER CAP AND TRADE BUT THIS COMMITMENT TO SORT OF HARNESS THE DEPRIVE INVESTMENT WILLINGLY- IS CONSISTENT WITH STATE AND FEDERAL ACTIONS. THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER CARBS AND SORORITY AND WE HOPE THIS LEGISLATORS INTENT AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THE FARM SECTOR IS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING SOME PRETTY DAFT TOUGH DECISIONS FOR SHIPPING OUT OF COALBED TIPPING INTO A DROUGHT WITH LABOR SHORTAGES AND- UNFORTUNATELY WILDFIRE CHALLENGES IN SUMMER ASKING THE MOST BASIC QUESTIONS LIKE DO I GROW ANYTHING. AND THAT THE SPONSOR NOTED STILL ARE FROM COMMUNITIES WANT TO STEP UP AND CONTRIBUTE TO CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND SO. IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE KNOW THAT IF WE PROVIDE THEM WITH THE TOOLS THEY'LL GET THEIR AND THE CLIMATE STUDIES SHOW CALIFORNIA NEEDS INTO BUT ENABLING PERMANENT CHANGE INCLUDING THAT CULTURAL CHANGE REALLY REQUIRES AN UNDERSTANDING AND RESPECT FOR THE SACRIFICE THAT IT TAKES TO MPLEMENT THE PRACTICES AND THE TRADE OFFS THAT ARE ENCOURAGED TO BE EXPLICIT. THAT THIS CLIMATE GOAL IS ROOTED. IN A VOLUNTARY HANDING GLOVE ACT. IS REALLY AND- AS WE RESPECT REQUEST THE COMMITTEE CAN. THE THAT NOW LOOKING FOR. THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW I. WE'VE GOT AND WE ARE HERE IN PERSON ON MEMBERS NICE AS THE OTHER FOR THE FIRST FIFTY MONTHS WE ARE THERE THE HELP. CURVE WE DO RESPECTFULLY AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL THIS WOULD BE OF COURSE THE FIRST TIME CARBON NEUTRALITY IS CODIFIED AND WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT MAKING SURE WE GET ALL THAT RIGHT. SO FIRST ASSURING THAT REUSING HARMONY TRAVEL THE IN A CONSISTENT WAY ACROSS REGULATIONS AND STATUTES AND SECOND THAT THE CARBON NEUTRALITY REQUIREMENTS DON'T FALL ON ANY ONE PARTICULAR SECTOR AND CENTER FLIGHT ON THE KANEMI WIDE BASIS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS TO MORE ACTIVELY INCLUDE THE AXE SPECIFIC SECTORS IN THE BILL AND THAT'S VERY HELPFUL INSTEAD OF DELEGATING THE PROCESS ENTIRELY TO THE AIRPORT- EVER WITH THE BILL STILL CAN BE INTERPRETED AS REQUIRING A CARBON EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOAL ON THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR SPECIFICALLY. SO REGIONAL LINES CAN DISAGREE ABOUT THE pSO WE DO CONTINUE AS MY COLLEAGUE AT THE FARM BUREAU INDICATED TO REQUEST OF THE AUTHOR INCLUDE A SPECIFIC RESIDENT REFERENCE IN THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL. TO THE NON BINDING VOLUNTARY NATURE OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GOALS ON THE ACCEPTOR WHILE THE AIR B. IS CONTINUING THE SCOPING PLAN PROCESS WHICH IS SET TO COMPLETE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR. SO WE UNTIL THEN WE DO RESPECTFULLY REMAIN AN OPPOSE UNLESS. AMENDED POSITION THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU WITH. SO LET'S NOW GO TO- THE PHONE LINES THEY DON'T UNISON IN PERSON WITH THE PHONE LINES. TO TAKE ANY TESTIMONY TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWO EIGHTY FOR ANYTHING ON THE LINE'S MODERATOR. ARTICULATE THIS SHOW- OPPOSITION FOR AB TWENTY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE. SEVENTY NINE. SEVENTY NINE YOU ARE OPEN. CAN YOU HEAR SEVENTY NINE PLEASE ON MUTE.

I'M THANK YOU SORTS BRINGS BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS THOUGHTS CONCERNS. SENATOR WITH CASKEY. WELL FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR- HI ACCEPTING THE MEMON SAID THAT THE STAFF IS WORKED OUT I AS YOU KNOW I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL- IN THE PAST I'VE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE AIR BOARD ON FIGHTING WITH THEM ON THE SCOPING PLAN AND WHAT WE KNOW IT'S NOT. BINDING IT THAT CERTAINLY HAS AN IMPACT OF POOR POLICIES GOING TO GO AND I WAS FOUND TROUBLING WHEN WE HAVE NATURAL WORKING LANDS YOU KNOW THE SENATE THREE YEARS AGO STARTED IN THE CAP AND TRADE BUDGET HAD NINETY MILLION DOLLARS FOR NATURAL WORKING LANDS THE- SPEAKER AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK THAT OUT AND- BUT WE CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR ALTERNATIVE. MANURE MNAGEMENT AND I'LL BE LEAVING HERE TO GO VOTE ON THE BUDGET THAT HAS A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION FOR ALTERNATIVES TO BURNING AGRICULTURAL WASTE BUT THOSE ARE REALLY RUN BY THE RESOURCE AGENCY OR THE AGRICULTURAL AGENCY SO I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU. YOU'VE ACCEPTED AMENDMENTS BECAUSE YOU MADE THE AIRPORT THE LEAD ON THE TERMS TURNING THE PRACTICES THE POLICIES THE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES WHAT WILL HAPPEN I MEAN. WE SAID YOU KNOW WE WILL CERTAINLY USE SOME CAP AND TRADE MINOR TRY TO USE SOME CAPTURE MONEY TO DO THE THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE INCENTIVIZE THAT OF THAT- NOW WERE YOU GOING TO INTEGRATE TO RECOMMENDATION SO. EXPLAIN HOW YOU SEE THE VALUE OF THE RESOURCE AGENCY AND THE AGRICULTURAL AGENCIES COORDINATING WITH THE AIRPORT- FOR THESE ALL THESE BENEFITS THAT WE WANT LET'S JUST STIPULATE TO THAT WELL I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK IN THIS SPACE- SO SENATORS WE'VE DISCUSSED AND I THINK YOUR- COMMENT IS A VERY GOOD ONE- WHERE THE INTENT OF. OF THIS LEGISLATION THIS EFFORT IN PARTICULAR IS TO BRING THESE DIFFERENT AGENCIES TOGETHER THESE YOU KNOW THESE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE CERTAINLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY. OF THE SCOPING PLAN AND THERE HAS BEEN. SOME PIECES OF NETWORKING LAN SCATTER ACROSS THE COPING PLANS OF THE IDEAS TO CERTAINLY. YOU KNOW HAVE A YOU KNOW STRONG A LEVEL OF THE SOME COORDINATION ACROSS THESE AGENCIES. TO HOPEFULLY DO A DEEPER DIVE INTO THIS ISSUE OF NATIONAL WORKING LANDS TO SEE HOW IT IS THAT WE CAN LEVERAGES NATIONAL WORKING LANDS TO YOU KNOW SENATE PLAY A MORE PROMINENT ROLE IN MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. OR YOU KNOW ACHIEVING A LOT OF TIME GOES AT LEAST I WAS THE STATE. I JEWS RETURNED FROM A TOUR ON FRIDAY AT THE TAHOE CONSERVANCY WHICH COMES OF THAT THE RESOURCE AGENCY AND THERE'S A NEW REPORT WHICH I HAVEN'T READ BUT- IT'S IN MY BY MY DESK. THAT SAYS THAT. IN IN THE TAHOE AREA. WE ONE EIGHT OF. HAS THE EXACT SAME CARBON SEQUESTRATION BENEFIT AS RECLAIMING AN ACRE IN THE AMAZON- FOR SO I KNOW PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT AMAZON CRAZY AND I WON'T GET INTO A DISCUSSION ON THE OFFSETS FROM THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM WHICH IS ANOTHER CONCERN WITH THE AIRPORT BUT I THINK PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE AND APPRECIATE. THE VALUE OF THIS OF THE WORKING LANDS AND THE AND THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE PROPER REHABILITATION OF THAT SO MIGHT MY HOPE WITH THAT YOUR LEGISLATION IS THAT IS THAT THERE IS IT THERE IS THIS THIS- COORDINATION BETWEEN THE- DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND WE GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HERE SO ALL. OF THE BILL MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- OF THE- ADDITIONAL FIVE QUESTIONS FACING THEN THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR CASKEY I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE MAN'S THERE ARE A LOT OF.

WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT BILL TO PROTECT CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN CURRENT LAW PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTING A NEW PUBLIC SCHOOL OR PUBLICLY FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOL. SCHOOL AUTHORITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM SEVERAL ACTS OF DUE DILIGENCE TO BETTER ENSURE THE HEALTH OF THEIR FUTURE STUDENTS AND SCHOOL STAFF. THEY DETERMINE THAT THE PROPERTY TO BE BUILT UPON IS NOT A CURRENT OR FORMER HAZARDOUS WASTE SITE.

RAILYARDS WITHIN ONE FOURTH OF A MILE THE PROPOSED SCHOOL SITE THAT MIGHT REASONABLY BE ANTICIPATED TO ADMIT HAZARDOUS AIR EMISSIONS. THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THE CURRENTLY DOES NOT APPLY TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND SOME CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND WHILE WE'RE NOT CLAIMING THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF THE SCHOOLS ARE POORLY CITED. INCREASING LAND USE DENSITY AND RE PURPOSING INFILL SITES RAISES THE POSSIBILITY THAT WITHOUT SIMILAR DUE DILIGENCE. FUTURE SCHOOLS MAY BE CONSTRUCTED IN THE VICINITY OF POLLUTION SOURCES THAT UNNECESSARILY EXPOSE CHILDREN AND EMPLOYEES. TO UP ON HEALTHY WORK ENVIRONMENT. AB SEVEN SIXTY TWO REQUIRES THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES TO ASSESS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE AND AIR POLLUTION CONDITIONS ON AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE PROPOSED SCHOOL.

THAT WILL MAKE IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS TO ACQUIRE HIGH QUALITY SAFE PROPERTIES. SHAPE PROPERTIES AS YOU CAN IMAGINE MOVED VERY QUICKLY IN CALIFORNIA COMPETITIVE REAL ESTATE MARKET. IN THIS BILL WILL HAVE THE UNINTENDED. EFFECT OF ACTUALLY MAKING FACILITIES LESLIE- CHARTER SCHOOL STUDENTS RATHER THAN MORE FOR THOSE AND OTHER REASONS WE ASK THAT YOU OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU WILL GO TO A JOHN LANGER WHO'S NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER SHURMUR'S JOHN LINGER HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION- WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE SPONSORS FOR THE CONTINUED DIALOGUE BUT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR KEY ISSUES- FIRST OF ALL TO GET STATE SUPPORTS ALL STUDENTS HAVING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY SAFE AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES. AND NATIONALLY INTRODUCED YET THEY HAD NO POSITION ON A. B. SEVEN SIXTY TWO HOWEVER WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IMPOSED IN THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE- WE BELIEVE THAT pUNWORKABLE UNWORKABLE AND INEQUITABLE AND WOULD LIMIT EDUCATIONAL ACCESS FOR MANY HIGH NEED STUDENTS UNDER CURRENT EDUCATION CODE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE REQUIRED TO MEET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE. IN ACQUIRING OR DEVELOPING FACILITIES HOWEVER CHARTER SCHOOL DO NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO RESOURCES THAT DISTRICTS DO. SO JUST LOCKED LOW BONDING AUTHORITY LOCAL THE EXEMPTIONS IN EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY THERE FOR CITING AND DEVELOPMENT. OF DISABILITIES FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. CHARTER SCHOOL USE AND PROTECT THIS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING COMPARED TO DISTRICT PROJECTS BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENING THAT BECAUSE OF THESE CHALLENGES ADDING NEW REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THE EXISTING RIGOROUS STANDARDS OF THE- CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE. SHOULD BE ONLY DONE WHEN A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED UNFORTUNATELY THE- AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN IN THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION ARE OVERLY EXCESSIVE INTO CLICK DUPLICATE THEIR- FOR THE PROSTITUTES CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN A MANNER THAT WILL BE INEFFICIENT AND COSTLY AND WILL NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THESE FACILITIES- WE BELIEVE THESE AMENDMENTS SEARCH ARE NOT JUSTIFIED TO GO BEYOND THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL- WE WOULD FURTHER NOTE THAT THE BILL SHOULD BE AMENDED TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE GRANDFATHERING PROVISIONS PROTECT. EXISTING SCHOOLS SCHOOLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT UNDER THE EXISTING RULES. ARE CHANGING THE RULES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROJECT- IT WOULD BE AT SIGNIFICANT LOSS TO COMMUNITIES WHERE CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE INVESTING. SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND COULD RESULT IN ALL. LACK OF ANY- QUALITY SOLUTION PROGRAMS IN THESE COMMUNITIES- WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES- BETWEEN SEVENTY Q. AND WE EDUCATION COMMITTEE BUT GIVEN THAT THESE AMENDMENTS WERE WERE FAIRLY RECENT WE DID FEEL. OBLIGATED TO GO ON RECORD AND OPPOSE- THE RECENT LANGUAGE AND WE. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. LET'S SEE IF THIS ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE. TO WEIGH IN IN OPPOSITION OR RAISE CONCERNS.

AND YET THEY DO- IF FOR REASONS THAT ARE TOTALLY ALMOST. REFERRAL TO THE CORE GOALS ARE YOUR GOALS YOUR BILL AND- THEY THEY WERE THEY WERE ADDED AND SO- YEAH. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME A HIGHER BAR TO AFFECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR PERHAPS A DIFFERENT REASONS THAN. WE SHOULD BE INVOLVED WITH SO. ANYWAY OKAY YEP YEAH I'M. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT- I YOU KNOW THIS THIS REMINDS ME OF SOME OF MY EXPERIENCES CHARITY KITCHEN COMMITTEE- THE DION RUNNING BATTLES NEVER NEVER SEEM TO CEASE- ANYHOW WE WILL WE WILL CERTAINLY ENTERTAIN MUCH LATER- AND I.

CYLLENE C. PLANNING SOME LOCAL ENTITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEGUN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING FOR THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HOWEVER MANY ENTITIES HAVE NOT BEGUN COORDINATING THIS PREPAREDNESS WITH JASON ENTITIES IN THE REGION AND SOME HAVE NOT BEGUN PLANNING. AT ALL I'M AFRAID TO DO THIS LACK OF COORDINATED PLANNING THE STATE'S CURRENT MECHANISM FOR FUNDING ADAPTATION PROJECTS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN PIECEMEAL. WITH NO COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY FOR COORDINATING ITS INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THE MOST EFFECTIVE. RESILIENCY RETURN THIS BILL AB EIGHT NINETY SEVEN SEEKS TO FILL THE GAP BY ENCOURAGING AND SUPPORTING REGIONAL CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING THAT BUILDS UPON AND ENHANCES LOCAL ADAPTATION ACTIONS TO REDUCE CLIMATE RISKS FOSTERING COLLABORATION AMONG LOCAL REGIONAL STATE ENTITIES ON ADAPTATION SOLUTIONS.

GOOD SCIENCE THAT'S COME FROM SOME OTHER PLACE THAT ARE HAVING- PR HERE AT THE STATE ARE TELLING THIS PARTICULAR GROUP THIS COME TOGETHER LET'S JUST SAY IT'S THE MPO HOW TO GO ABOUT DESIGNING THEIR PLAN AND AN MPO USUALLY IS DEALING MAINLY WITH.

THE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB EIGHT NINE SEVEN I ASSEMBLY MEMBER MULLIN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER. ALAN HI ALAN I BATES. DALLY GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN BY CAL SKI HI LCI OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOU MISTER MOM WE WILL AND WE'LL LEAVE THAT ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER FOLKS TO ADD ON. ALL RIGHT WE ARE NEXT FIVE. FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER CITY COM LOGGER WHO IS PRESENTING AB NINE SIXTY TWO. AREA SOME FAVOR MIND- YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THE MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB NINE SIX TWO YES SENATOR WOULD HAVE BE IT IS AN A. B. BAIL. I FIRST LIKE TO SAY THAT I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AB NINE SIXTY TWO WILL PAVE THE WAY FOR RETURNABLE BEVERAGE BOTTLE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA BY ALLOWING THESE PARTICULAR MODELS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CALORIE CYCLE BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM. RATHER THAN BEING CRASHED FOR RECYCLING THESE BOTTLES CAN BE PRESERVED TO BE WASHED AND REFILLED BY BEVERAGE PRODUCER SIMULTANEOUSLY CREATING JOBS AND REDUCING WASTE. THE DATA SHOWS CALIFORNIANS PURCHASE AN AVERAGE OF TWO TO THREE PACKAGED DRINKS EVERY DAY ALMOST 1100% OF WHICH ARE IN SINGLE USE GLASS PLASTIC METAL AND PAPERBOARD BEVERAGE CONTAINERS. THE LARGEST CATEGORY OF THESE ARE BEVERAGES COVERED. BY THE C. R. V. BOTTLE BILL PROGRAM WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR JUST OVER TWENTY FIVE BILLION SINGLE USE CONTAINERS ANNUALLY THAT IS SO MUCH WASTE. SO 7280% OF THESE CONTAINERS ARE RETURNED AND SUCCESSFULLY RECYCLED INTO NEW CONTAINERS. NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TONS OF SINGLE USE BEVERAGE CONTAINERS ARE STILL DISPOSED OF ANNUALLY IT IS A WEIGHTY PROBLEM THAT IS NOT GOING AWAY SOON. BUT THERE ARE CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING THEIR PART BY USING RETURNABLE BOTTLES. MEANING THAT THESE FILES CAN BE CLEANED WASHED AND THEN REUSED THESE BOTTLES ARE THE MOST SUSTAINABLE CHOICE FOR BEVERAGE CONTAINERS AND THERE'S A GROWING INTEREST IN USING MORE GLASS RETURNABLE BOTTLES. I LIKE TO THINK OF THE MILK MAN YOU KNOW COMING BACK TWENTY pKINDS OF BEVERAGES IN THOSE GLASS BOTTLES. THE RETURNABLE BOTTLES KEEP OUR AIR CLEAN OUR BEACHES IN OUR PARKS AND ROADSIDES LITTER FREE OR- YES HOPEFULLY COMPLETELY A 100% PROMOTE OF CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND-INCENTIVIZE A RENEWAL. OF RETURNABLE GLASS SOMETHING THAT WAS COMMON FORTY YEARS AGO. LAST YEAR I VISITED ORGANS RETURNABLE BOTTLE SYSTEM BOTTLE DROP. WHERE THESE BOTTLES ARE SORTED WASHED STERILIZED INSPECTED AND DELIVERED BACK TO CRAFT BEVERAGE PRODUCERS. CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESSES HAVE STARTED USING GLASS RETURNABLE BOTTLES. BUT THEY ARE TAKING THEM OUT OF THE STATE TO HAVE THEM WASHED STERILIZED AND INSPECTED SO WE ARE IN FACT TAKING BUSINESS OUT OF THE STATE. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY ENCOURAGING A SECTOR- IN THIS INDUSTRY ALSO TO GROW AND EXPAND OUT OF THE STATE WHY NOT CREATE A STATUTORY FIX WITH EIGHTY NINE SIX TWO THAT WILL ALSO CREATE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL. BENEFITS LAST WEEK THE STATEWIDE COMMISSION ON RECYCLING ISSUED A UNANIMOUS SEVENTEEN TO ZERO RECOMMENDATION TO SUPPORT THIS BILL SAYING THAT IT WOULD BE A NECESSARY TOOL TO SUPPORT THIS NEW AN ESSENTIAL WASTE REDUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE. WITH ME IN SUPPORT TODAY IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE MARK MURRAY AND KIRK CAMELS TO ANHEUSER BUSCH REGIONAL VP OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS AND AT THE TIME WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE I WILL BE RESPECTFULLY ASKING AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE ABLE TO READ YOUR- WE WITNESS I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- MEMBERS MADAM VICE CHAIR AS WELL I GUESS I'M NOT THE QUITE THE MILKMAN BUT I DEFINITELY WILL. BE YOUR MAN ON THIS ONE- FOR KIMMEL SHOE AT THE ANHEUSER BUSCH- IN HAZARD BUSH OPERATES REFILLABLE UNRETURNABLE SYSTEMS AROUND THE WORLD I CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS- ADDED THIS PROGRAM AND THE ADDITION OF RETURNABLE BOTTLES TO THE PROGRAM WOULD OFFER THE STATE- ANHEUSER BUSCH HAS A 100% OF OUR PACKAGING GOALS- BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TO BE MADE FROM A MAJORITY RECYCLED CONTENT. OR CONTENT THAT IS RETURNABLE WHICH IS WHY WE SEE SUCH VALUE IN SENATOR KAMLAGER PROPOSAL AT THE ADDITION OF RETURNABLE BOTTLES TO THE STATE'S RECYCLING PROGRAM ADVANCES SUSTAINABILITY GOALS NOT ONLY FOR A. B. BUT ALSO FOR BEVERAGE PRODUCERS ACROSS THE STATE AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED. AN INCREASE IN RETURNABLE BOTTLE OPERATIONS ALSO PUTS CALIFORNIA ON A PATH. TO A GREEN ECONOMY BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL JOBS LOCAL PRODUCTION OPTIONS AND LINE WORKERS MANAGERS AND BOTTLE COLLECTORS AS THE SENATOR OUTLINED AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE JOBS STAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SPEAKING OF THAT RIGHT HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS POP PARTICIPATED IN A PILOT PROJECT THAT WE LAUNCHED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS AND THE DESIRE FOR RETURNABLE BOTTLES. AND WHAT I'M HAPPY TO REPORT IS THE PILOTS PILOT SHOWED TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL FOR THE FUTURE OF RETURNABLE BOTTLES IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THAT REASON THAT WE THANK THE SENATOR FOR HER EFFORTS ON THIS AND HER LEADERSHIP AND WE URGE THE COMMITTEE. TO SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT YOU. OKAY LET'S GO TO MARK MARIN ATOP WAY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE- WE KNOW THAT A REFILLABLE BEVERAGE CONTAINER HAS A LOWER CARBON FOOTPRINT THAN A KICK CONTAINER THAT IS USED ONCE. EVEN WHEN THAT CONTAINERS RECYCLED IN A CONTAINER HAS 50% RECYCLED MATERIAL IN BOTH OF WHICH IS CURRENTLY THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA- TODAY THERE ARE GLASS BEVERAGE CONTAINERS BEING MANUFACTURED IN RECYCLED CALIFORNIA IT COULD BE WASHED REFILLED. CENTER CALM WATERS EIGHTY NINE SIXTY TWO WILL UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING RULES AND INCENTIVES TO ALLOW THE STATE EXPENSE THAT WORK A BUYBACK RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCEPT AND PAY REAP ON VALUE. MODERATE RISK REUSABLE CONTAINERS. TRANSPORTERS CONTAINERS TO BE WASHED FOR REDUCE RATHER THAN CRUSHED AND RECYCLED. AND ALLOW BEVERAGE PRODUCERS LIKE BEAR FLAG IN AND HUNDRED PUSH TO REBUILD CONTAINERS WE URGE AND I BOTH. OKAY THANK YOU MARK OKAY SO LET'S GO TO SEE THE DENNIS WANTS TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL I KNOWN IN PERSON ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES YOU WANT TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT FOR A BI. NINE SIXTY TWO.

MODERATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- TO SHOW EXPRESS OPPOSITION TO AB NINE SIX TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO. AND WE ARE GETTING NOBODY QUEUEING UP AT THIS TIME OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING THE BILL BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THOUGHTS SILVA CASKEY. ASM I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE MATTER OF FORD I KNOW PEOPLE THERE THAT HAVE TESTIFIED OR SUPPORT. I WANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE CHAIR SAID MY EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY BILL IS BEING AMENDED SO THAT TECHNICALLY. ALL THE CURRENT BOTTLE BILL WOULD PUT BE DISSOLVE BIRTH IS BEING AMENDED TO CARRY THROUGH. MATCH COM ARBORISTS- REDUCE PORTIONS OF IT TO THE EXTENT OF PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY- SIDE AS WELL AS A DOCTOR WOODS BACKDROPS OF THOSE THOSE ELEMENTS ARE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ARE COMING FOR COMMITTEE NEXT NEXT WEEK THAT THE AMENDMENT WILL ALLOW. THE REUSABLE OF PORTION TO GO THROUGH IN THIS I'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR THE OTHER SHE'S VISITED OR AGAIN AS THE CHAIR HAS AN IS I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE REUSABLE- BOTTLE PORTION OF IT AND- THE OTHER THIRTY NINE. EXETER. PRODUCER- PROGRAMS AT THEIR THROUGH THE WORLD ALL HAVE A REVIEWS BOTTLE PORTION OF IT TOO SO IT'S NOT IT'S NOT ANYTHING STRANGE BUT BECAUSE OF WHERE WE HEAR IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY BRINGING THAT BACK IN AND I HAVE A BILL THAT WOULD. WOULD SHIFT RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE MANUFACTURERS WE WANT TO BE CERTAIN THAT EVERYBODY THAT KNOWS. ON THIS- CONCERN ABOUT THE CITY'S PORTION WILL CONTINUE AS IT DOES. ALL OVER THE WORLD- AND I APPRECIATE DE AMENDMENTS SAY SEE THAT THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL. CONCERNS IT WILL HAPPEN I REMOVED THE BILL. OKAY I'M SURE THE FAN OF THE BILL I YOU KNOW WE WERE THERE AT THE BIRTH OF THIS BILL AND AN ORGAN TOGETHER AND- AS SOON AS WE AS WE GOT TO EXPLORE THIS REALLY EXTRAORDINARY PRETTY AND INVENTIVE FUND PROGRAM THEY HAVE. I IN OREGON WHERE YOU KNOW ALL THESE BEER MANUFACTURERS GET TOGETHER AND- WASH THE BOTTLES AND REALLY REUSE THEM AND- THEY WORKS REALLY WELL AND IN FACT IF THE INTERESTING THING IS WE ACTUALLY VISITED A WINERY. THAT WAS USING THE THEY THEY THEY DECIDED TO SIGN UP AND OF COURSE THEY HAD TO USE THE BEER BOTTLES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS STANDARDIZED THE WHOLE POINT IS YOU'RE USING. THE EXACT SAME. BOTTLES AND THEN THE TO SLAP THEIR OWN LABELS ON. MON AND THE YOU KNOW IT'S CERTAINLY A SMALLER BOTTLE THAN A TRADITIONAL WINE BOTTLE BUT THEY FOUND THAT NOT ONLY WAS IT. GREAT FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM BUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T WANT A FULL BOTTLE OF WINE RIGHT THEY WANT THE SMALLER BOTTLES. AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THE BOTTLE CAP SEALS IT JUST AS WELL. AS A CORK. SO THERE'S REALLY NO- HI THIS YEAR THERE'S NO HALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT WITH KEEPING. YEAH THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT SO DAVE SO IF WE COULD DO SOMETHING SIMILAR HERE AND COMPANIES CAN PARTICIPATE IT'S A WAY OF- WHILE GLASSES HELP HIGHLY RECYCLABLE MATERIAL. THE COURSE IT'S NATURAL MATERIAL. I'M THERE'S A LOT OF ENERGY GOES INTO RECYCLING AND I MEAN YOU KNOW THE- NO I'M I'M- REALLY SUPPORTER CLASS BUT DID KNOW I'VE- NEVER BEEN DOWN TO MODESTO AND WATCH THE PHOTO GALLO MELTDOWN THE GLASS AND THE AMOUNT ON THE CULLITON TURNED INTO NEW BOTTLES- YOU WILL WE REALIZE PRETTY QUICKLY HOW MUCH. HOW ENERGY INTENSIVE A PROCESS THAT IS- THEY GOTTA GET REAL YOU GET THAT REAL THOSE FURNACES GET VERY HOT. AND IF THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO GET A LOT MORE LIFE OUT OF THESE BOTTLES JUST BY WATCHING THEM- ABSOLUTELY HI STANDARDS ETCETERA. WE ARE THE WE MIGHT AS WELL AND SO I'M I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR- OF YOUR BILL AND- MISTER CHAIR IT'S NOT LOST ON THE PRODUCERS OF GLASS BOTTLES THAT THEY'RE A COVERED ENTITY UNDER CAP AND TRADE SO IS THE COST OF BY PARTICIPATING IN THE IN THE AUCTION A CAPTURED CLOSE UP THAT COSTS IS ALSO GOOD TO GO UP SAID THIS IS AN ALEC AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT. PROVIDE US WITH BEVERAGES TO SHIFT TO ANOTHER DAY THE PRICES ARTIFICIALLY LOW AT NINETEEN DOLLARS A METRIC TON BUT THAT'S THAT'S NOT TO BE DEBATED DURING THIS BILL BUT THIS ISN'T THIS IS EVERYBODY WHO'S WHO'S WATCHING UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS ISN'T A WAY FOR THEM TO GET OUT OF THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM IF THEY'RE- HAVING A REUSABLE BOTTLE. SO STAY TUNED FOR ITS ABSOLUTE RIGHT IN WITH THAT IN MIND I. BECAUSE I KNEW THE BILL'S COMING MY COMMUNITY STATE OFF BUT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. MOVING FORWARD IF THAT'S AT ALL POSSIBLE NEED TO BE A COOPERATIVE THANK YOU VERY I DO REMEMBER. IT'S HARD A LOT FASTER OKAY SO THE BILL'S REMOVE ETCETERA CASKEY IF YOU LIKE TO CLOSE SENATOR AND CREATE A PROJECT THAT. THE OPENNESS SOME FOR MY COLLEAGUES TO FOR THIS THIS IMPORTANT IS A POLICY.
