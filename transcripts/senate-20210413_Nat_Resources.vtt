00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:38.009
DONE PERFECT BECAUSE WE'RE

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:40.077
RIGHT AT FIFTEEN MINUTES- SO

00:34:40.144 --> 00:34:42.046
THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO WILL

00:34:42.113 --> 00:34:45.650
BRING THE MATTER BACK- BEFORE

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.585
THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS AND

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:49.854
COMMENTS THAT COMPLETES THE-

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:52.824
OPPOSITION TWO PEOPLE HAVE-

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.394
QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR.

00:34:56.461 --> 00:34:58.729
SENATOR GROVE THANK YOU MISTER

00:34:58.796 --> 00:35:00.798
CHAIR M. MR ONE THANK YOU FOR

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:01.899
BRINGING YOUR BILL FORWARD AND

00:35:01.966 --> 00:35:05.136
I APPRECIATE- THIS COMMENTS- IN

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:06.804
OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY.

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:10.041
BECAUSE 70% OF THE OIL PRODUCED

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:10.975
IN THE STATE IS PRODUCED IN MY

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:14.378
COUNTY- I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF

00:35:14.445 --> 00:35:16.447
QUESTIONS ON THE A DOLLAR

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:19.016
VALUE- YOU KNOW THERE'S THREE

00:35:19.083 --> 00:35:21.652
MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE SENSE I

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:22.854
BELIEVE THIS OR FROM THE BAND

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.022
WILL FIND ANOTHER STE- THERE

00:35:25.089 --> 00:35:26.390
WAS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:27.758
AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THERE WAS

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:29.260
TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.263
SWEPT OUT INTO THE- AND- I

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.232
BELIEVE THE GENERAL FUND. IF

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.700
THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE

00:35:35.766 --> 00:35:37.235
BEING USED BY CAL JIM TO

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.402
ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT YOU WANT

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:39.470
TO ADDRESS BASED ON YOUR

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.672
PREVIOUS BILL LAST YEAR AND

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.841
OTHER BILLS. IN THE RESOURCES

00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:45.576
ARE IN THESE FUNDS HOWEVER

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.211
THEY'RE NOT BEING USED IN THEIR

00:35:47.278 --> 00:35:51.482
BEING SWEPT OUT TO BE FUNDING

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.885
AT OTHER PARTS OF GOVERNMENT- I

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:55.086
GUESS I WANT TO SAY DON'T YOU

00:35:55.152 --> 00:35:56.020
THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE THAT

00:35:56.087 --> 00:35:57.321
WE INCREASE THE FEES EVEN

00:35:57.388 --> 00:35:59.190
THOUGH THE FEES ARE ALREADY-

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:03.461
NOT BEING USED. ALREADY- BUT I

00:36:03.528 --> 00:36:04.428
DON'T WANT TO BE I'M NOT TRYING

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:05.429
TO BE RUDE I JUST DON'T HAVE

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:06.764
ANOTHER WAY TO ASK IT SO I

00:36:06.831 --> 00:36:09.000
GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT. IF

00:36:09.066 --> 00:36:10.001
THE FUNDS ARE BEING SWEPT FROM

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:12.770
THIS- THAT THE MONEY IS BEING

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:14.906
SWEPT FROM THESE THIS FUND. FOR

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.041
OTHER USES AND YOUR BILL IS TO

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:18.609
INCREASE THE SPEND SO MONEY CAN

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:19.911
BE USED FOR THIS PARTICULAR

00:36:19.977 --> 00:36:21.979
PURPOSE OF CAL JAM. THE CALCIUM

00:36:22.046 --> 00:36:23.247
IS EASING THE FENCE I GUESS MY

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:24.749
QUESTION IS IT WHY IS THERE A

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:26.684
PURPOSE FOR YOUR BILL. IF THE

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.086
MONEY'S BEING USED- NOT BEING

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:29.954
USED ALREADY AND IT'S BEEN

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.123
SWEPT TO ANOTHER. PART OF

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:35.359
GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU SENATOR-

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.028
AND I DON'T WANT TO ACTUALLY.

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:38.963
POINTS TO THE ANALYSIS ON BOTH

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:40.364
PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS AND

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:42.667
ALSO ASK THREE. OF THE ANALYSIS

00:36:42.733 --> 00:36:44.835
AS WELL AS TEACH NINETEEN AT

00:36:44.902 --> 00:36:46.470
THE IDYLLWILD REPORTS TALKS

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:49.106
ABOUT HOW TO FIND IT- EXIST AND

00:36:49.173 --> 00:36:50.274
I THINK THAT THE COMMENTS THAT

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:51.909
ARE MADE. HAVE BEEN MADE THAT

00:36:51.976 --> 00:36:54.478
THE- I'M MONEY HAS NOT BEEN. A

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:56.914
WIDELY USED COMPLETELY. IS

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:59.083
ACTUALLY NOT THE FULL PICTURE

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:00.685
AND THE ANALYSIS GOES INTO THE

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:04.889
DETAILS- CAL CHEN HAS TO.

00:37:04.956 --> 00:37:06.223
GATHER THE MONEY AND THEN BE

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.225
ABLE TO WORK ON THE PROJECT AND

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:10.461
SO THEY HAVESPENT UP TO THREE

00:37:10.528 --> 00:37:11.929
MILLION THEY CANNOT SPEND OVER

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.130
AND SO IT HAS BEEN A VERY

00:37:13.197 --> 00:37:14.565
DELICATE MATCH OF FINDING THE

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:16.667
RIGHT PROJECT. TO BE ABLE TO DO

00:37:16.734 --> 00:37:18.235
AND SO AGAIN IF FROM THE

00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:19.937
ANALYSIS WE WILL SEE THAT TO-

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:21.305
THE PICTURE THAT'S BEEN PAINTED

00:37:21.372 --> 00:37:22.239
THAT THE FUNDS HAVE NOT BEEN

00:37:22.306 --> 00:37:24.542
USED APPROPRIATELY- IT IS NOT

00:37:24.609 --> 00:37:27.011
THE FULL PICTURE- THERE IS ALSO

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:28.212
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:37:28.279 --> 00:37:30.247
RECOGNIZE THAT. EVEN WITH

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:32.516
EXISTING EFFORTS AS POINTS OUT

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:34.518
IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THE

00:37:34.585 --> 00:37:35.753
LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS YOU

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.755
REFERENCE MY BILL IN THE PAST

00:37:37.822 --> 00:37:39.657
IS STILL NOT ENOUGH IF YOU HAVE

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.392
A RANGE FROM FIVE HUNDRED AND

00:37:41.459 --> 00:37:43.294
TWENTY PLUS MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:37:43.361 --> 00:37:44.195
FIVE POINT TWO MILLION THAT'S

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:46.564
ESTIMATED. ALL OF THESE EFFORTS

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:49.166
ARE STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PLUG

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:51.836
AND ABANDON THE CURRENT WELLS

00:37:51.902 --> 00:37:53.471
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU

00:37:53.537 --> 00:37:54.205
KNOW THAT'S NOT EVEN

00:37:54.271 --> 00:37:55.473
CONSIDERING THE POTENTIAL

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.142
FUTURE WELLS. THAT COULD BE

00:37:58.209 --> 00:37:59.844
ABANDONED AND SO I THINK THAT

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.278
THIS IS WHY THIS BILL IS

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:03.948
NEEDED- AND- I DON'T AGREE THAT

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:06.183
IT'S A YOU KNOW. RIGHT NOT

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.685
APPROPRIATE TO BRING THIS BILL

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.753
FORWARD I THINK THAT IT'S

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:09.687
NEEDED I THINK THAT THE

00:38:09.754 --> 00:38:12.156
ANALYSIS- HIGHLIGHTS THAT AND

00:38:12.223 --> 00:38:15.359
CLARIFIES- TO THE OPPOSITION-

00:38:15.426 --> 00:38:17.294
THAT THE FUNDING REALLY IS

00:38:17.361 --> 00:38:21.198
BEING. USED- IN AN APPROPRIATE

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:22.366
WAY. SO ARE YOU SEE NOAM WAS

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:23.067
FROM THIS ACCOUNT TO GO TO

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:25.436
OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES ITS

00:38:25.503 --> 00:38:28.773
1100% INDUSTRY FUNDED. I CANNOT

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:30.608
SPEAK ON THE MANY SLACKS STUDY

00:38:30.675 --> 00:38:32.076
I AM NOT I AM NOT DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:34.612
FINANCE AND SO I CAN'T. SPEAK

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.747
TO THAT AND I WILL SEE IF. THE

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:38.616
COMMITTEE STAFF CAN SPEAK TO

00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:40.618
THE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. OKAY

00:38:40.685 --> 00:38:42.219
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE THREE

00:38:42.286 --> 00:38:43.721
MILLION IN THE SPECIAL FUNDS

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.489
RIGHT SO I GUESS BUT YOUR BILL

00:38:45.556 --> 00:38:46.457
WANTS TO INCREASE THOSE

00:38:46.524 --> 00:38:48.459
DOLLARS. AND A THREE MILLION TO

00:38:48.526 --> 00:38:50.127
THE SPECIAL FUND CORRECT THE

00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:51.028
THREE MILLION TO THE SPECIAL

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.230
FINE. BUT MANY HAS BEEN SWEPT

00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.299
FROM THIS FUND INTO OTHER AREAS

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:59.003
OF GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW I GUESS

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:00.638
WE CAN GET IT. I DON'T HAVE

00:39:00.705 --> 00:39:02.206
LIKE A BALANCE SHEET THAT SHOWS

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:05.042
MANY IN AND OUT BUT- MONEY FROM

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.310
THIS FUND THAT YOU WANT TO

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.212
INCREASE WASN'T USED IN WAS HE

00:39:08.279 --> 00:39:09.780
AND THEN WAS SWEPT TO ANOTHER

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.683
PART OF GOVERNMENT FOR. ANOTHER

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:15.419
USE- I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE.

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.021
I DON'T SEE MORE PRODUCTIVE I

00:39:17.088 --> 00:39:18.089
JUST THINK THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:18.989
SURE THAT THE MONEY THAT IS IN

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.558
THIS FUND IS USED FOR THE

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.393
PURPOSES OF THE FUND WHICH IS

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:24.628
TO ADDRESS THE ORPHANED AND

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:27.031
ABANDONED WELLS- AND IF MONEY'S

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:28.632
BEEN TAKEN FROM THE SEVEN WHICH

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.401
IT APPEARS THAT IT IS- WE DON'T

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:31.535
NEED MORE LEGISLATION TO

00:39:31.602 --> 00:39:32.937
INCREASE MONEY TO GO BACK INTO

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:34.672
THIS FUND WE NEED MANY TO WE

00:39:34.739 --> 00:39:36.140
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE

00:39:36.207 --> 00:39:37.708
MONEY IN THIS FUND IS USED FOR

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:39.577
THE PURPOSE OF THE FUND IF THAT

00:39:39.643 --> 00:39:43.547
MAKES SENSE. THANK YOU SENATOR

00:39:43.614 --> 00:39:45.483
AND I WILL SAY THAT I THINK.

00:39:45.549 --> 00:39:46.517
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:39:46.584 --> 00:39:48.185
IDENTIFYING TWO DIFFERENT ITEMS

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:49.987
ONE. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY.

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:54.558
IS NEEDED TO ACTUALLY. SECURE

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:55.726
TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM RIGHT OF

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:57.928
THE ABANDONED WELLS- THE BUT

00:39:57.995 --> 00:40:01.098
YOU'RE ALSO SPEAKING TO- DAY.

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.467
THAT HE LEFT. FUNDS SO THOSE

00:40:03.534 --> 00:40:04.802
ARE TWO DIFFERENT FUNDS THAT

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.670
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO THE

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:07.404
THREE MILLION SPECIAL SIGN IS

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.940
NOT THAT. HE WAS FUNDS THAT'S

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:12.977
H. E. W. A S. I CAN'T RESPOND

00:40:13.043 --> 00:40:14.378
TO THAT QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.646
NOT A FUND THAT I'M DEALING

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:17.515
WITH. THEY ARE SEPARATE SIGNS.

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:18.816
THAT YOU'RE LEADING TO AND

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:21.619
CERTAINLY- I ACTUALLY SHARE.

00:40:21.685 --> 00:40:23.921
YOUR OPINION THAT- MONEY FOR

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:25.756
ABANDONED UP AND PLUG WHAT

00:40:25.823 --> 00:40:27.424
ABOUT FOR BILL- BATTING IN AND

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.193
PLUGGING WELLS. SHOULD BE USED

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.528
FOR THAT. SO I JUST WANT TO

00:40:30.594 --> 00:40:31.929
IDENTIFY THAT THE MONEY THAT

00:40:31.996 --> 00:40:33.130
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WAS

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:35.633
SWEPT. INTO IS NOT THIS TIME.

00:40:35.699 --> 00:40:41.071
IT'S. THE- HE'D WHAT FUNDS. A

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:41.572
BUT ALL THESE FUNDS ARE

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:42.206
CONTROLLED BY CAL JIM RATE OR

00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:45.376
NOT. SO I ME BUT I CAN'T SO

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:46.844
AGAIN I CAN'T SPEAK TO A

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:48.279
DIFFERENT FUND AND BUILD THIS

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:50.514
BILL DOES NOT. LEAD TO AN END

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:52.550
SO THAT IT YOU KNOW IF THERE IS

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:54.018
A DIFFERENT WORKER DIFFERENT

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:57.288
BILL. FOR A DIFFERENT FIND I'M

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:59.824
I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I SHARE

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:02.827
THE OPINION THAT. FUNDS SHOULD

00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:05.429
BE USED FOR THE INTENDED

00:41:05.496 --> 00:41:07.498
PURPOSE THANK YOU MA'AM. FROM

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:09.800
SENATOR LIMóN- CENTER GROVE

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:11.502
SAID SHE SHOULD KNOW HOW TO ASK

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:13.637
THE QUESTION ANOTHER WAY. AND I

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:15.172
THINK I DO WANT TO ASK THE

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:17.641
QUESTION ANOTHER WAY. BECAUSE

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:20.244
THE- WHEN I WAS RESOURCES

00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:22.646
SECRETARY AND OVERSAW THAN

00:41:22.713 --> 00:41:26.417
DARKER. WE HAD THIS INCREDIBLE

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.019
FOR FUN WHILE PROBLEM WHO WHERE

00:41:29.086 --> 00:41:30.821
IT WAS SOMETHING TO LOSE SLEEP

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:32.523
OVER THAT THERE WERE THESE

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.124
ORPHAN WELLS COMING WHERE THERE

00:41:34.191 --> 00:41:37.094
WAS NO AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.629
WAS IN RESERVE FOR ANYWHERE

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:41.565
THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO DO

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:42.633
IT AND IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:45.002
GOING TO BE A HUGE COST DUMPED

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:47.071
BURKE UNDER THE TAXPAYERS SO

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:49.240
THE QUESTION IS. DO YOU HAVE

00:41:49.306 --> 00:41:52.443
SOME SENSE. OF COMPLETELY

00:41:52.509 --> 00:41:54.211
SEPARATE FROM WHAT GOES INTO

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:56.647
THESE FUNDS OR WHAT BILLS THE

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:59.383
BILLS SAY SOME SENSE OF WHAT

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.219
THE POTENTIAL COST IS FOR MORE

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:05.956
FOR ORPHAN WELLS THAT EXIST OUT

00:42:06.023 --> 00:42:08.158
THERE RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:10.327
YES CHAIR AND ACTUALLY THAT

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:13.130
REALLY DOES RANGE BETWEEN FIVE

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.232
HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE POINT

00:42:15.299 --> 00:42:17.034
TWO BILLION DOLLARS ON THE

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:18.469
CURRENT WELLS AND THIS IS FROM

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:19.703
THE TWENTY NINETEEN IDYLLWILD

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.105
REPORT- SO THIS IS A

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:23.841
CALCULATION SO THIS IS WHY. WE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.876
ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS TO

00:42:25.943 --> 00:42:27.344
REMEDY THE FACT THAT WE DON'T

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:28.946
WANT THE TAXPAYERS TO BIRD AND

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:31.015
ALL OF THAT- THE COST IT IS A

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.517
VERY BIG COSTS SO IF. YOU JUST

00:42:33.584 --> 00:42:35.386
LOOKING AT THE WELLS OUT THERE-

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:38.522
EATS A BIG RANGE- AND CERTAINLY

00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:40.190
AT ONE MILLION WHICH IS WHAT

00:42:40.257 --> 00:42:41.825
THE ORIGINAL AMOUNT WAS AND AS

00:42:41.892 --> 00:42:44.695
THE FIND- IT WOULD TAKE US OVER

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.463
FIVE HUNDRED YEARS I TO BE ABLE

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:48.799
TO DO THE MINIMAL WORK- BUT WE

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.000
REALLY WON'T KNOW UNTIL THE

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:52.136
WORK. YOU KNOW IT IS STARTED

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:52.937
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.838
RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS AT

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:56.273
IMPORTANT WORK YOU KNOW FOR

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:57.808
CALIFORNIA WORKERS AND SO IT'S

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.243
REGRETTABLE THAT YOU KNOW THAT

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.744
THERE'S NINE PINYIN THAT

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:01.812
INCREASING THE FINE WOULD

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:04.114
CREATE MORE YOU KNOW JOBS- BUT

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:05.249
IT CERTAINLY THAT IS SOMETHING

00:43:05.316 --> 00:43:07.618
THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT- WE WANT

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.687
THIS WORKED AND WE WANT. TO BE

00:43:09.753 --> 00:43:13.590
ABLE TO FIND WAYS TO. FOR THE

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:16.894
CLEANUP OF THIS- YOU KNOW OF

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.495
THESE AND THIS BIG PROBLEM HAS

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:19.496
BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY INDUSTRY

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.131
IT IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT THAT I

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:22.499
THINK THAT IS A COMMON

00:43:22.566 --> 00:43:23.968
DENOMINATOR WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:25.903
THIS IS A PROBLEM- AND THESE

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.071
ARE REALLY BIG FUNDS WERE

00:43:27.137 --> 00:43:28.672
LOOKING AT SO WE CERTAINLY WANT

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:31.342
TO FIND A WAY. TO SOLVE NOW AND

00:43:31.408 --> 00:43:34.578
THEN THERE. THE POINT ABOUT

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:37.348
SWEEPING MONEY FROM ANY FUND

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:40.517
MAKES NO SENSE IT IT'S LIKE WHY

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:41.285
WOULD YOU SWEEP MONEY FROM THE

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.754
FUND. IF IT'S BETWEEN FIVE

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.289
HUNDRED MILLION AND SOME

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:47.024
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:48.826
OBLIGATION THAT EXISTS OUT

00:43:48.892 --> 00:43:51.628
THERE HE IS YOUR BILL

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:53.097
ADDRESSING THE MAXIMUM THAT

00:43:53.163 --> 00:43:59.336
WOULD PREVENT. THE SWEEPING. OF

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:00.104
FUNDS IN THE FUTURE. TELL MY

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.772
BILL ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE OF.

00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.707
ANY DOES SPECIFY THAT IT WOULD

00:44:03.774 --> 00:44:05.009
BE FOR IT PLUGGING AND

00:44:05.075 --> 00:44:06.844
ABANDONING WELLS. AND SO IF

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:09.279
THERE WAS INTEREST IN IT.

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.415
DOUBLE OR PROCESS TO FIND OUT I

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.316
WOULD CERTAINLY WORK WITH THE

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.751
COMMITTEE TO DO THAT I MEAN

00:44:13.817 --> 00:44:15.652
THAT READ THIS IS VERY VERY

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:18.689
SPECIFIC- FOR THIS EFFORT. AND

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.324
WE DON'T KNOW OF ANY INSTANCE

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:21.859
WHERE ANY FUNDS HAVE BEEN SWEPT

00:44:21.925 --> 00:44:23.360
FROM THIS FIND THAT WE'RE

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:26.130
WORKING ON- AND- I THINK THAT

00:44:26.196 --> 00:44:28.599
THERE IS. ALSO A LARGER

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:30.467
CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.336
ALL. BECAUSE THIS FUND WILL

00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:33.971
NEVER AT LEAST IN THIS

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.773
ITERATION OF THE OF THE BILL

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:38.809
WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. FOR THE

00:44:38.876 --> 00:44:40.377
ENTIRE PROBLEM BUT IT WILL BE

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.679
BETTER ADDRESS THE PROBLEM- I A

00:44:42.746 --> 00:44:44.181
THINK THAT THERE IS THERE ARE

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:45.916
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:47.551
IMPORTANCE AND THE VALUE OF

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:50.921
LOOKING FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:53.590
PAY FOR IT. THE IT SEEMS TO ME

00:44:53.657 --> 00:44:56.126
THAT. IF THERE IS A FIVE

00:44:56.193 --> 00:44:57.795
HUNDRED MILLION TO MULTI

00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:00.697
BILLION DOLLAR PROBLEM AFTER-

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.766
AND THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WANT

00:45:02.833 --> 00:45:07.137
TO TAXPAYERS TO PAY THAT- END

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.206
WE WOULD LIKE THERE TO BE JOBS

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.841
THAT REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA-

00:45:10.908 --> 00:45:12.576
TOWARD DEALING WITH ORPHAN

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:15.045
WELLS. IF THERE'S ANY PART OF

00:45:15.112 --> 00:45:17.614
YOUR BILL THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS

00:45:17.681 --> 00:45:19.817
THOSE ISSUES CLEARLY IF THIS

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.552
BILL MOVES TODAY WOULD YOU BE

00:45:21.618 --> 00:45:22.653
WILLING TO WORK WITH

00:45:22.719 --> 00:45:24.254
STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT TO MAKE

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:27.024
SURE THAT THAT THAT GETS

00:45:27.091 --> 00:45:29.960
ADDRESSED CORRECTLY. ABSOLUTELY

00:45:30.027 --> 00:45:31.995
OKAY BIGGER BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO

00:45:32.062 --> 00:45:33.597
ME THAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:34.765
THAT WERE RAISED AT THE

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.967
COMMITTEE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:39.536
THE END AT THE END WE SHOULD-

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:43.140
RICHEST ARE NOTE THE MANY

00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:44.441
CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED TO

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.676

UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDUSTRY

NOT AN EXPERT UNDERSTANDING BUT

A GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.990
INDUSTRY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.224
SURE THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:34.958
IT'S LISTENING TO THIS

ABANDONED WELLS. IT'S ALL 1100%

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:46.870
INDUSTRY FUNDED. AND IF THIS

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:49.039
FEE GOES FORWARD INDUSTRY WOULD

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:51.775
BE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR AND THIS

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:53.744
IT WAS FOR THIS FUND IT WOULD

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.146
NOT GO ON TAXPAYERS SHOULDERS.

00:46:56.213 --> 00:47:00.350
M. THE FRUSTRATION THAT I HAVE

FIFTY MILLION FIVE MILLION

00:47:03.086 --> 00:47:04.721
THREE MILLION THE MONEY EVEN

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.589
THOUGH THEY'RE TWO SEPARATE

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:06.957
FUNDS THEIR USE FOR THE SAME

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:08.525
PURPOSE TO ADDRESS THE ORPHAN

INDUSTRY AS A CONCERN WITH THAT

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.598
MANY IS NEVERTHELESS STILL

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:15.766
BEING SWEPT OUT OF THESE

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:19.136
ACCOUNTS IN INTO OTHER SOURCES

00:47:19.203 --> 00:47:21.004
OF OUR OTHER REASONS TO SPEND

PRODUCERS IN THE STATE. I DON'T

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:54.304

WITH THAT FUND THAT'S BEING

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:44.354
REFERENCED OKAY. THEN WE'RE

GOOD IT'S JUST MY EXPERIENCE IN

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:47.991
THE PAST IS THAT WAS ALONE THIS

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:49.359
BUT MISTER CHAIR THE POINT IS

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.560
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A TWENTY

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:51.728
TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS ON

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.297
ESTIMATES ONLY AND WE'RE TAKING

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:56.733

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.569
PROVIDED FUND NOT TAX FOR ITS

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:01.772
ITS SOLELY INDUSTRY FUNDED. AND

00:49:01.838 --> 00:49:03.240
WE'RE TAKING THE INDUSTRY

00:49:03.307 --> 00:49:04.841
CONSISTS MANY THESE FRIENDS

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.076
RATHER IT'S THE ABANDONED OR

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:07.644
FROM A FINE OR THAT THE OTHER

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:09.112
FIND THEIR USE FOR THE SAME

00:49:09.179 --> 00:49:10.180
PURPOSE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE

00:49:10.247 --> 00:49:11.114
THAT WE ALL KNOW WE HAVE IN

00:49:11.181 --> 00:49:13.050
CALIFORNIA. WE'VE A TWENTY TWO

00:49:13.116 --> 00:49:14.418
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AND THEY

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.386
TAKE THAT MONEY FROM THOSE FANS

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:17.454
THEY'VE SWEEP IT LOAN AT

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.956
WHATEVER. WINS LAST TIME ALONE

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:21.425
IS BEEN PAID BACK YOU KNOW

00:49:21.491 --> 00:49:24.795
HELLO MOORLACH SORRY I WAS

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:25.429
BUDGET CHAIR. SIXTEEN YEARS AGO

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.364
WE DID. OF LOANS AND THEN JERRY

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.766
BROWN PAID THE MALL BACK. SO

00:49:29.833 --> 00:49:33.837
DO. SO BUT I THINK. I THINK IT

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:36.173
IS SIGNIFICANT IF IT'S A LONE

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.108
ENDED AND IT'S SORT ARE WILL

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.577
STIPULATE THAT THE FINANCE

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.013
DEPARTMENT MAKES ME CRAZY OF A

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.719
BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE WORK.

00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:50.020
AWARENESS OF HOW IT MIGHT

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:53.156
POLITICALLY UP BECAUSE THIS IS

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:56.693
PAID FOR BY THE THAT THE PEOPLE

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:58.061
THAT ARE REGULATED AND SHOULD

00:49:58.128 --> 00:49:59.529
GO FOR THE STATED PURPOSE

00:49:59.596 --> 00:50:00.964
PERIOD THE END TEN IT IS NOT

00:50:01.031 --> 00:50:03.533
PART OF THIS BILL AND I THINK

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:06.103
THE SECOND THING. IS THAT I

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.104
DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY HAS ANY

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.005
UPDATED INFORMATION BUT I KNOW

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:10.574
THAT WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.708
THE SUBJECT PART OF THE

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.510
EXASPERATION IS THE STATE

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:16.012
AGENCY WAS TAKING FOREVER TO

THAT YEAR THERE MIGHT BE A LOT

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:22.686
OF ORPHAN WELLS OUT THERE BUT

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:23.887
DEALING WITH IT AND I THINK

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:25.222
THERE'S EVEN A BUDGET REQUEST

00:50:25.288 --> 00:50:26.890
THIS YEAR TO TRY TO GIVE THEM

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:27.924
THE STAFF TO MAKE SURE THEY

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:29.893

00:50:46.443 --> 00:50:49.579
QUICKER. WELL I MEAN IS THAT

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.014
THE BILL THAT WE CARRIED IT IN

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:53.717
THE PAST WAS IT AN EFFORT TO

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:55.852
INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF CAL

00:50:55.919 --> 00:50:57.854

00:51:21.878 --> 00:51:23.313
BROUGHT IN FRONT OF US THERE'S

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:25.081
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM PEOPLE

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:26.850
THAT ARE REALLY CONCERNED.

00:51:26.917 --> 00:51:29.352
ABOUT JOBS. THERE'S A QUESTION

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.321
ABOUT WHETHER FOR FRIEND WELLS

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:33.223
ARE BEING PROCESS QUICK ENOUGH.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.624
THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.860
WHETHER FINANCES THING IS A

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.830

THOSE THINGS ARE THINGS THAT I

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:49.139
THINK WOULD INFLUENCE THIS AND

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.641

MOVE THIS ALONG AND WORK ON IT

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:01.618
BUT I THINK THAT. FOR THIS BILL

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.353
TO MOVE THOSE QUESTIONS NEED TO

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:05.922

THOSE MONTHLY REPORTS AND

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:15.911
THOSE. THINGS ARE COMEBACKER

01:10:15.978 --> 01:10:17.913
LITERALLY STACKS OF PAPER. AND

01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.248
WE SAY PUT ON THE WEBSITE BUT

01:10:19.315 --> 01:10:21.317
THEN. YOU READY EIGHTY EIGHTY

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.218
ISSUES RUN THE SCANNING ISSUES.

01:10:23.285 --> 01:10:25.487
YOU KNOW- BACKLOG SO IF WE CAN

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:27.256
MAKE THE PROCESS ELECTRONIC WE

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.824
THINK THAT MONTHLY PROCESS IN

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:29.425
THE COURT OF THE PROCESS WILL

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.060
GO A LOT FASTER. AND THERE'S A

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.361
FEW PIECE OF DATA THAT THAT

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.163
DOESN'T INCLUDE I THINK IT'S-

01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:35.564
ACID WELL TREATMENTS AREN'T IN

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.899
THERE AND THEN ALSO. THE

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:39.535
HISTORIC PEACE I GUESS. YOU'RE

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:40.703
RIGHT ABOUT THE SORT OF ON

01:10:40.769 --> 01:10:42.738
GOING NEW ACTIVITY BUT I THINK

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:44.373
IT'S THE IT'S THE WILL HISTORY.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:45.708
AND THE HISTORY ON THE NOTICES

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.776
OF VIOLATION OR THE HISTORIES

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.745
OF. OF A DIFFERENT TREATMENTS

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.313
AND THAT WELL. THAT AREN'T.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.815
DIGITIZED AND THERE AREN'T ON

01:10:52.881 --> 01:10:55.050
THEY ARE IN THE FILES RIGHT NOW

01:10:55.117 --> 01:10:56.552
AND INFORMING WILL STAR SO

01:10:56.619 --> 01:10:57.686
THAT'S- THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:10:57.753 --> 01:10:59.989
RUNNING IT NOT. NOT AT SPACE

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.624
BEING SLOW OF NEW SUBSTANTIVE

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:03.826
REQUIREMENTS. GET THE PROCESS

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:05.127
TO WORK I THINK IS THE PRIMARY

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:06.462
GOAL. THAT'S THAT THAT PMR

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.530
COMMITTEE. OKAY AND SO WHEN YOU

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:09.898
TALK TO US RECENTLY SAID ABOUT

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:11.200
THE HISTORY OF THE WELL SO YOU

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.801
HAVE AN OPERATOR. FOR INSTANCE

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.036
I'VE AN OPERATOR THAT'S TRYING

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.004
TO GET A TRANSFER OF SOMEBODY

01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:16.639
WHO'S- GONNA BAN THE WELLS I

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:17.573
MEAN THEY'RE JUST GOING TO BE

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:18.707
ABANDONED AND SOMEBODY'S GONNA

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:19.975
HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM BUT

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.143
WE HAVE A VIABLE OPERATOR. THAT

01:11:21.210 --> 01:11:23.045
WANTS TO TAKE OVER THOSE WELLS

01:11:23.112 --> 01:11:24.780
TO MAKE THEM PRODUCTIVE- IN MY

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.615
DISTRICT AND THERE'S BEEN A-

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:29.151
HUGE CHALLENGE. TO TRY TO GET

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:31.186
PERMITS TO- TRANSFER

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:32.755
ACQUISITION TO TAKE PLACE. WHEN

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.289
WORKING WITH CALDERON CALLE JIM

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.691
ON THAT. AND I'M JUST USING HIS

01:11:35.758 --> 01:11:37.793
EXAMPLE. THE REASON WHY THERE'S

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.962
A PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THE VIABLE

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.164
OPERATOR IS NOT WILLING TO TAKE

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:43.732
ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF WHAT

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:44.800
HAPPENED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO

01:11:44.867 --> 01:11:46.568
WITH THIS WELL. CAME THEY DON'T

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:47.503
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NOBODY KNOWS

01:11:47.569 --> 01:11:48.804
WHAT HAPPENED. BUT IT WOULD

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:50.472
MAKE THIS NEW VIABLE OPERATOR

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:52.841
RESPONSIBLE. AND SO I GUESS

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:53.942
THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.678
HISTORY OF STUFF THAT HAS TO BE

01:11:55.744 --> 01:11:57.479
THERE WHEN THERE'S NO. THERE'S

01:11:57.546 --> 01:12:01.950
NO WAY. TO TELL WHAT HAPPENED A

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:02.551
HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THINGS

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:03.085
WERE REGULATOR FIFTY. AGO

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:04.219
THINGS AREN'T. THE WAY THEY ARE.

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.087
SO THERE'S NO WAY TO PUT IN

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:05.654
FOR. UP BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:07.656
EXIST WHAT. KIND OF-

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.158
REQUIREMENTS AS YOUR BILL GOING

01:12:09.224 --> 01:12:10.726
TO REQUIRE THESE OPERATORS TO

01:12:10.793 --> 01:12:12.728
BE OUR PRODUCERS. TO GO BACK

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:14.830
AND- FOR HOW LONG WHAT PERIOD

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.066
OF TIME AND RIGHT YOU KNOW

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:19.535
WHAT'S REQUIRED I MEAN IF YOU

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:20.669
AN OPERATOR THAT AT THE END OF

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:21.737
THE WELL AND SOMEBODY TOOK IT

01:12:21.804 --> 01:12:22.938
OVER AND TRIED TO FIX IT AND

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.006
THEN THEY DID AND THEY RAN IT

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.074
FOR AWHILE AND THE BANDIT YOU

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.075
KNOW IS GONNA YOU KNOW IT WAS

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:27.643
TRANSFERRED AGAIN. THERE'S GOT

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.011
TO BE A POINT IN HISTORY WHERE

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:30.713
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS HAS

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.181
HAPPENED TO THESE PARTICULAR.

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.717
WELL YES I AGREE AND I THE BILL

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:36.919
DOES NOT FORCE THEM TO

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.554
NECESSARILY REACH BACK AND-

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.522
DIDN'T GET NEW HISTORY IT'S-

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.857
IT'S GETTING THOSE WELL. THE

01:12:41.924 --> 01:12:44.059
EXISTING WELL HISTORIES ONLINE

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.295
AND MANAGEABLE. BUT I I'M HAPPY

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:48.097
TO WORK WITH YOU IF. IF THERE'S

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.131
SOME IMPLICATION OF THE

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.933
LANGUAGE THAT THEY HAVE TO. GO

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.101
THROUGH SOME EXTRAORDINARY

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:53.469
MEASURES ARE IMPRACTICABLE

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:55.104
EFFORTS OR WHATEVER TO FIND.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.338
I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT

01:12:56.405 --> 01:12:57.139
BECAUSE I WAS NOT THE INTENTION

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:01.577
TO. TAKE UP A WHOLE NEW- YET TO

01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:02.878
GO DO THE FORENSICS A HUNDRED

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:05.280
YEARS AGO- MORE SO JUST MAKING

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:06.448
PROCESS WITH THAT COMPLETE

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:09.184
YOUR- YOUR QUESTION. YES SIR

SIR. LET ME ADD SOMETHING I WAS

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.922
WAITING FOR A BREAK IN THE

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:19.862
CONVERSATION. AND THAT IS IT. A

01:13:19.928 --> 01:13:20.863
PRIOR INCARNATION- OF THE

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.698
THINGS WE DID WHEN IT WAS

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:25.000
DARKER WE BROUGHT IN A STRIKE

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:28.470
TEAM BECAUSE THERE WERE FIFTY

01:13:28.537 --> 01:13:30.672
THOUSAND HISTORIC PERMITS. AND

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.976
TRY TO DIGITIZE ALL OF THEM.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.945
AND THAT WAS NOT. ON THE

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:39.948
COMMITTEE THAT WAS DONE BY THE

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:42.518
AGENCY THEMSELVES AND HE ONE

01:13:42.584 --> 01:13:44.887
THING. IS I HAVE NO IDEA THE

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:46.622
STATUS I HAVE NO IDEA IF THEY

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.757
GOT ALL THE WAY THROUGH I KNOW-

01:13:48.824 --> 01:13:51.894
PARTWAY THROUGH- IN WHAT WOULD

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.462
BE HELPFUL IF THIS BILL MOVES

01:13:53.529 --> 01:13:55.464
FORWARD. IS IF YOU WOULD

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:57.432
IDENTIFY THAT AND THEN YOU

01:13:57.499 --> 01:13:58.901
COULD SPEAK TO YOUR BILL IN

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:01.470
ADDITION TO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:03.472
ALREADY AND IF IT IS BASICALLY.

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.040
THAT NOW THINGS WILL BE

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.109
SUBMITTED IN A DIGITAL FORMAT

01:14:07.176 --> 01:14:08.911
SO THAT THE AGENCY DOESN'T HAVE

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:10.813
TO GO BACK AND DIGITIZED THEM

01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:12.848
AFTER THE FACT THAT WOULD BE A

01:14:12.915 --> 01:14:15.284
GOOD FACT TO KNOW AS THE BILL

01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:17.019
IS MOVING FORWARD AND IT SEEMS

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:18.921
TO ME THAT. THAT IS THAT'S WHAT

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.556
YOU SHOULD DO IN CASE THE BILL

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.424
GETS OUT TODAY BEFORE YOU GET

01:14:22.491 --> 01:14:24.293

SURE THAT THE PUBLIC REALLY

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:44.379
DOES UNDERSTAND THAT. IT'S NOT

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.215
THE AGENCY THAT PAYS FOR THIS

01:14:46.281 --> 01:14:48.617
IT'S INDUSTRY THAT FUNDS THIS

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:50.786

THE- AGENCY GETS THE FUNDING

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.701

THOSE WORKERS- AND I THINK THIS

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:50.303
DOVETAILS WITH THE PASSED BILL

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.438
AS I THINK WAS REFERENCE

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:53.840
BEFORE- THAT THERE IS AN

01:51:53.907 --> 01:51:55.809

ORPHAN WELLS- AND THOSE SHOULD

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:05.051
BE A SKILLED AND TRAINED

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:06.052
WORKFORCE AND I AM VERY

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:09.022
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PASSED. A

01:52:09.089 --> 01:52:11.458
BILL. BECAUSE WE NEED TO REALLY-

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:14.594
BE BLIND HERE. IN CALIFORNIA-

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:17.130
WE VIEW OURSELVES. AS A GLOBAL

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:19.399
LEADER ON HERE ON ENVIRONMENTAL

01:52:19.466 --> 01:52:21.634
PROTECTION AND CLIMATE ACTION.

01:52:21.701 --> 01:52:23.570
AND IN MANY WAYS WE ARE THIS

01:52:23.636 --> 01:52:25.371
STATE HAS DONE GREAT WORK ON

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:27.273
CLIMB IN SO MANY WAYS BUT NOT

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:29.509
UNIVERSALLY. AND THERE IS A

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:32.045
LARGE STAIN ON CALIFORNIA'S

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.013
CLIMATE RECORD AND THAT IS

01:52:34.080 --> 01:52:37.050
WHILE. WE ARE ONE OF THE

01:52:37.117 --> 01:52:38.751
LARGEST OIL EXTRACTION STATES

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:40.487
KERN COUNTY IS THE SEVENTH

TOTAL US OIL. PRICES SOMETIMES

01:52:51.631 --> 01:52:52.499
CALIFORNIA IS VIEWED AS LIKE

01:52:52.565 --> 01:52:55.635
THE OPPOSITE OF FAIR TAXES ON

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:58.438
THIS WE REALLY ARE NOT. AND NOT

01:52:58.505 --> 01:53:00.640
ONLY- OUR PRODUCTION NUMBERS

01:53:00.707 --> 01:53:03.443
QUITE LARGE- IN CERTAIN AREAS

01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:05.545
BUT WE ARE ONE OF THE ONLY

01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:07.747
MAJOR OIL PRODUCING STATES

THE OIL THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

01:53:21.361 --> 01:53:23.429
STILL EXTRACT IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:25.198
ONE IN CALIFORNIA THE QUALITY

01:53:25.265 --> 01:53:27.667
OF THAT OIL HAS DECREASED TO

01:53:27.734 --> 01:53:29.869
SUCH A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT. THAT

01:53:29.936 --> 01:53:32.438
WE ARE NOW ON PAR WITH THE

01:53:32.505 --> 01:53:35.675
DIRTIEST SANDS. OIL FIELDS IN

CANADA. DOTTORE CALIFORNIA IS.

01:53:39.812 --> 01:53:42.081
SO TO SUGGEST AS SOME OF THE

CLEAN OIL EXTRACTION IT'S

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:52.358
SIMPLY NOT THE CASE IF YOU LOOK

01:53:52.425 --> 01:53:54.727
AT WHAT WE EXTRACT AND WHERE WE

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:57.664

WHEN IT COMES TO OIL CALIFORNIA

01:55:48.441 --> 01:55:50.376

THIS ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. OF

ONE OF THE CONCERNS IS THAT

02:41:56.239 --> 02:41:59.376

THIS MORNING IN OPPOSITION. OR

02:42:18.328 --> 02:42:19.763
AS YOU SAY THE MAJORITY OF THIS

02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:22.299
OIL IS PRODUCED BY ELIMINATING

02:42:22.365 --> 02:42:24.868
ALL OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION SB

02:42:24.935 --> 02:42:26.236

IN LEGAL LIABILITY AND FINALLY

02:42:42.018 --> 02:42:43.820
S. B. FOR SIXTY SEVEN IMPLIES

02:42:43.887 --> 02:42:45.989
THAT LOCAL OIL AND GAS

02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:47.457
PRODUCTION IS NOT ESSENTIAL AND

02:42:47.524 --> 02:42:49.793
CRITICAL AND WILL DISRUPT ALL

02:42:49.860 --> 02:42:51.194
OF CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL SUPPLY

02:42:51.261 --> 02:42:53.296
CHAINS. DURING THE GLOBAL

02:42:53.363 --> 02:42:54.631

AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE

02:43:04.141 --> 02:43:04.808
NECESSARY TO PROTECT OUR

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:11.715
THERE'S- SOME THINGS THAT BRING

02:43:11.781 --> 02:43:16.019
BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION.

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:22.159
ARE THE TALKING POINTS- OF THE

02:43:22.225 --> 02:43:25.595
OPPOSITION- TO THE BILL- AND-

02:43:25.662 --> 02:43:30.834
WE- WE- CERTAINLY- I DON'T

02:43:30.901 --> 02:43:33.336
AGREE WITH THEM I THINK PART OF

02:43:33.403 --> 02:43:34.237
THE NARRATIVE THAT THE

02:43:34.304 --> 02:43:36.072
OPPOSITION HAS ATTEMPTED TO

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:37.807
PAINT. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S

02:43:37.874 --> 02:43:41.645
SOMEHOW THIS SELF CONTAINED OIL

02:43:41.711 --> 02:43:44.481
ECOSYSTEM WHICH IS NOT TRUE

02:43:44.548 --> 02:43:46.116
CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY

02:43:46.183 --> 02:43:48.351
CALIFORNIA'S REFINERIES WHICH

02:43:48.418 --> 02:43:50.587
ARE REALLY A SEPARATE INDUSTRY

02:43:50.654 --> 02:43:52.088
FROM THE OIL EXTRACTION

02:43:52.155 --> 02:43:54.925
CALIFORNIA REFINERIES. IMPORT

02:43:54.991 --> 02:43:57.961
SOMETHING LIKE 70% OF THE OIL

02:43:58.028 --> 02:44:00.430
THEY REFINED TO ALREADY TODAY

02:44:00.497 --> 02:44:03.967
70% OF THE OIL IS IMPORTED SO

02:44:04.034 --> 02:44:06.736
TO SUGGEST THAT WERE SAID THAT

02:44:06.803 --> 02:44:07.270
THIS IS SOME SORT OF SELF

02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:08.905
CONTAINED. CALIFORNIA IS WE'LL

02:44:08.972 --> 02:44:11.775
INDEPENDENT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE

02:44:11.841 --> 02:44:13.243
IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA'S

02:44:13.310 --> 02:44:15.912
REFINERIES. EXPORT A

02:44:15.979 --> 02:44:18.048
SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF A

02:44:18.114 --> 02:44:19.549
REFINED OIL OUTSIDE OF

02:44:19.616 --> 02:44:21.751
CALIFORNIA SO THIS IS NOT A

02:44:21.818 --> 02:44:23.587
SITUATION WE DRILL IT HERE THEN

02:44:23.653 --> 02:44:25.255
IT'S REFINED HERE AND THEN IS

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.957
CONSUMED HERE AND WE'RE NOW

02:44:27.023 --> 02:44:29.392
GOING TO MAKE A CALIFORNIA HAVE

02:44:29.459 --> 02:44:31.528
TO RELY ON OTHER WILL THAT'S

02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:34.331
ALREADY HAPPENING- AND SO I

02:44:34.397 --> 02:44:36.499
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO.

02:44:36.566 --> 02:44:39.302
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BOND AND

02:44:39.369 --> 02:44:40.971
YOU KNOW I THINK- YOU KNOW THE

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:42.606
REASON WHY WE HAVE PROPOSES

02:44:42.672 --> 02:44:44.841
AMENDMENTS. TO EXTEND THE BILL

02:44:44.908 --> 02:44:47.043
AL IN TERMS OF THE BOOK OF THE

02:44:47.110 --> 02:44:49.212
EXTRACTION DOWN A LARGE

IT IS NOT. AND I CONSIDER

02:48:05.942 --> 02:48:08.211
MYSELF INCREDIBLY PRIVILEGED TO

02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:10.113

CALIFORNIANS AND MY DISTRICT

02:48:15.652 --> 02:48:16.820

NONE OF THOSE ARE ELECTRIC WILL

02:48:21.491 --> 02:48:22.959
LIKE TO TRAVEL THAT'S NOT GOING

02:48:23.026 --> 02:48:24.427
TO BE ELECTRIC SO WE WOULD HAVE

02:48:24.494 --> 02:48:26.729
TO TRANSITION OFFENSE AND- THEN

02:48:26.796 --> 02:48:27.597
I AND I DO GREE WITH THE

02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:29.332

TRANSITION OF JOBS IS- IS VERY

02:48:32.902 --> 02:48:33.736
VERY VERY SLIM AND NOT AND NOT

02:48:33.803 --> 02:48:35.572
REAL. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OF

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:37.674
THIS IS A MAJOR IMPACT OF THIS-

02:48:37.740 --> 02:48:39.576
IS THE ACCUSED AMOUNT OF JOBS

02:48:39.642 --> 02:48:41.377
AND THE CORRESPONDING JOBS THAT

02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:42.512
WILL BE LOST THAT GO. ALONG

02:48:42.579 --> 02:48:45.849
WITH THIS SO. THAT WE IT THE

02:48:45.915 --> 02:48:48.485
END JUST TO JUSTICE. THIS TO

02:48:48.551 --> 02:48:50.320
SAY OF COURSE WE DON'T WANT

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.288
PEOPLE LIVING BY BY WELLS THIS

02:48:52.355 --> 02:48:53.823
CLOSE IT IS UNSAFE. AND

02:48:53.890 --> 02:48:58.461
CALIFORNIA DOES IT SAY FOR THAT.

02:48:58.528 --> 02:48:59.062
ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AS

THE SAFEST SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING

02:49:05.702 --> 02:49:07.070
IS WE'RE STILL GOING TO USE IT

02:49:07.136 --> 02:49:08.004
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO USE IT

02:49:08.071 --> 02:49:09.138
FROM PLACES THAT PRODUCE AT ALL

02:49:09.205 --> 02:49:11.841
LESS SAFELY. WITH CARE FOR

02:49:11.908 --> 02:49:14.077

03:08:35.804 --> 03:08:38.306
COUNTY- APPROACH WHICH I THINK

03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:39.908

03:08:39.975 --> 03:08:42.010

03:09:03.732 --> 03:09:04.966

A PRIVILEGE. AND LOW INCOME

03:09:53.982 --> 03:09:54.449
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OFTEN
