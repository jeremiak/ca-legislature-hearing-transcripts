FOR A JUDGE TO BE ABLE TO ORDER

AND WE CAN STRIKE UNDER CURRENT

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.866

ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:25.585
AS SENATOR JACKSON'S

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:26.185
[inaudible]

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:30.156
WELL I I LIKE THE IDEA OF GIVING

00:06:30.223 --> 00:06:31.657
JUDGES DISCRETION I DISAGREE

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.659
THAT.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.328
LIMITING IT TO UNUSUAL

00:06:35.394 --> 00:06:37.463
CIRCUMSTANCES OR IN THE

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:38.798
INTERESTS OF JUSTICE REALLY DOES

00:06:38.865 --> 00:06:40.466
THAT SO I AGREE THAT YOUR BILL

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:42.068
DOES ASSIST WITH THAT.

00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:45.838
I HAVE A CONCERN NOW AND THAT IS

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:48.574
THAT YOU YOU ANALOGIZE THE COST

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:51.077
OF INCARCERATION VERSUS THE COST

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:51.911
OF TREATMENT.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:53.446
AND I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:55.448
THAT IF WE HAD TREATMENT WE

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:57.183
WOULD CERTAINLY BE LIKELY THEY

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.384
HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES THAN WE

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:00.086
HAVE BY JUST PUTTING SOMEONE IN

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:01.587
JAIL OR IN PRISON FOR A PERIOD

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:03.089
OF TIME WHERE.

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:04.290
NOT MUCH IS DONE TO TRY TO

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:06.759
ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE

00:07:06.826 --> 00:07:08.060
IN A SERIOUS WAY.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.062
IT SHOULD BE AND WERE ASPIRING

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:13.132
TO IT BUT I WONDER IF THERE IS

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.100
ANY.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:18.971
DATA THAT SHOWS THAT BY.

A WHOLE LOT OF THOSE PROGRAMS

ALL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS IN

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:06.018
C. C. R. REALLY TO TO GET TO HOW

00:08:06.085 --> 00:08:07.186
THESE PROGRAMS WORKING WITH

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:08.688
FOUNDED A LADDER TRUCK PROGRAMS

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:11.390
SUCCESSFUL WITH COGNITIVE

00:08:11.457 --> 00:08:14.060
BEHAVIOR -- WE HAVE STILL HAVE A

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:15.127
LOT OF WORK TO DO AT THE LOCAL

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:19.799
LEVEL -- AND AND SO I THE WORD

00:08:19.866 --> 00:08:21.400
ASPIRATIONAL -- I LIKE I BELIEVE

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:23.569
IT'S WE CAN GET THERE AND NOT

00:08:23.636 --> 00:08:24.971
ONLY A WHOLE -- I THINK WE MUST

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:25.972
GET THERE WE NEED TO ATTACK IT

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.173
FROM BOTH ENDS.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.842
AND SO -- WE DO NEED TO BEEF UP

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:31.510
OUR OUR FAMILY DRUG

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.112
REHABILITATION PROGRAM BUT ARE

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.380
CUTTINGTO BE ABLE PROGRAM AT

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.515
THE LOCAL LEVEL I BELIEVE THIS

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:36.716
BILL.

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:38.684
WILL HELP US GET THERE I'M SURE

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:40.486
THAT A JUDGE WILL NOT JUST SEND

00:08:40.553 --> 00:08:42.622
SOMEONE SOME PLACE WHERE THEY

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.390
CAN GET TREATMENT AND HOPEFULLY

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:45.958
IT BEEFS UP SOME OF THE AT THE

00:08:46.025 --> 00:08:47.426
LOCAL LEVEL IT WILL BE FOR THOSE

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:48.761
THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:52.164
MY LAST QUESTION IF I MAY

00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:52.999
MANAGED CARE.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.233
IF I WERE JUDGE AN I HAD AN

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.769
OPTION -- TO GIVE SOME TO TO

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:58.604
REQUIRE SOMEONE GO THROUGH

00:08:58.671 --> 00:09:00.706
TREATMENT VERSUS TWO HUNDRED AND

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.174
EIGHTY DAYS IN JAIL.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:03.776
THAT TO ME IS THIS THE CARROT

00:09:03.843 --> 00:09:05.144
AND THE STICK APPROACH THAT WE

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.812
NEED TO BE LOOKING FOR BUT DO WE

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:08.748
KNOW WHETHER OR NOT JUDGES DO

00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:10.816
HAVE THAT OPTION BECAUSE AS YOU

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:13.319
SAY THE THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM.

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:15.187
A PROGRAMMATIC APPROACH TO THIS

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:16.622
AND MANY COUNTIES IS JUST

00:09:16.689 --> 00:09:19.492
INADEQUATE SO WHAT DO YOU TELL A

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.193
JUDGE AT THAT POINT IN TIME.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.862
I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE

00:09:22.929 --> 00:09:23.963
DOING IS ALLOWING JUDGES TO BE

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.730
ABLE.

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:26.799
TO TAKE THOSE THOSE OPTIONS I

00:09:26.866 --> 00:09:28.067
THINK BECAUSE OF THOSE THOSE

00:09:28.134 --> 00:09:29.835
DECADES DECADES LONG THE

00:09:29.902 --> 00:09:31.737
MANDATORY MINIMUMS WERE BECOMES

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.439
VERY EASY JUST TO SEND SOMEONE.

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:34.840
TO JAIL FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.975
DAYS EXCEPT THAT.

00:09:36.042 --> 00:09:37.810
INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAKE.

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:39.312
ME DO THE WORK TO TRY TO FIND

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:40.513
SOME PLACE TO PUT THEM THERE I

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:43.115
THINK THAT WILL RELIEVE SOME

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:44.417
JUDGES TO TAKE THAT EXTRA STEP.

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.319
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THE JUDGES

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.253
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WILL AND

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:47.787
THAT THE WHOLE THE WHOLE

00:09:47.853 --> 00:09:51.991
CELEBRATION DEPARTMENT ALL THESE

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:53.292
FOLKS HAVE.

00:09:53.359 --> 00:09:54.760
TO BOTH ALL THESE ALL THESE --

00:09:54.827 --> 00:09:56.429
ALL THESE VARIOUS AGENCIES HAVE

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.998
GOT TO HAVE ALTERNATIVES.

00:09:59.065 --> 00:09:59.932
AND AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING

00:09:59.999 --> 00:10:00.566
ARE YOU.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:02.234
HOW WE GONNA GET TO THAT POINT

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.136
THAT IS THAT WOULD MAKE THIS

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:06.038
MAKE LOGICAL GOOD SENSE THERE

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:08.574
ARE PROGRAMS ARE SUCCESSFUL?

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:10.376
I CAN TRY TO GET YOU DATA ON THE

00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.677
ONES ACROSS THE STATE OF WAR

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:13.412
HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SOME OF THEM

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:14.213
ARE BUT THE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.814
OF THEM.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.248
WE NEED TO GET MORE OF THEM AND

00:10:16.315 --> 00:10:17.650
SO MY QUESTION IS HOW HOW IS

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:20.753
THIS BILL GOING.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.754
TO HELP THAT TO HAPPEN.

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.222
THIS WILL HELP DRIVE MORE PEOPLE

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:25.558
TO THE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS NOT

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:28.127
ALL OF THEM ARE OVER SPENT OR OR

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.096

DISCRETION MAY BE NEEDED AND SO

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:19.078
THIS THIS BILL WILL ALLOW FOR

RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION

THIS BILL DOESN'T APPLY TO OUR

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.836
MEMBERS BUT WE THINK IT'S GOOD

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:32.104
POLICY.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:35.741

I APPRECIATE WHAT.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:58.464
THE AUTHOR IS I'M TRYING TO DO

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.966
IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.635
OF THESE WHAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:04.169
LOOPHOLE.

00:15:04.236 --> 00:15:06.272
MY THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE WITH

00:15:06.338 --> 00:15:08.173
IT.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:09.608
AND COLLEGE JEEZ WHAT WITH BEING

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:10.809
ON CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IN THE

00:15:10.876 --> 00:15:12.177
REST WE DIDN'T GET TO

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.113
COMMUNICATE THIS SAYS --

00:15:14.179 --> 00:15:16.982
DIRECTLY BUT IS THE ABILITY THE

00:15:17.049 --> 00:15:19.451
LAW NOW ALLOWS FOR THE TRANSFER

00:15:19.518 --> 00:15:21.387
AND THE TRANSFER OR SALE COULD

00:15:21.453 --> 00:15:23.522
BE TO A PERSON WHO IS.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:27.026
NOT COVERED OTHERWISE AND AT

00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:31.096
LEAST THE ONLY.

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:32.264
GREAT OF INHERITANCE TRUE BUT

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:40.406
STILL IT IS -- IT IS -- OPENING

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:42.708
UP A LITTLE BIT DOES RESTRICTIVE

00:15:42.775 --> 00:15:44.710
LAWS WE'VE HAD AND BUT IT

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.712
RECOGNIZES THAT FOR LAW

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.747
ENFORCEMENT WHO MAY ALREADY HAVE

00:15:48.814 --> 00:15:50.182
SUCH WEAPONS WE DON'T WANT TO

00:15:50.249 --> 00:15:52.518
MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO HAVE

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:53.952
THAT WEAPON BUT I'M NOT

00:15:54.019 --> 00:15:57.156
COMFORTABLE WITH THE TRANSFER.

00:15:57.222 --> 00:15:59.325
AND I WOULD BE MUCH MORE

00:15:59.391 --> 00:16:01.560
COMFORTABLE IF WE COULD.

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:03.629
FIND LANGUAGE YES YES AND I

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.230
WOULD HOPE IS A UNDER EXISTING

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.900
POLICE PROCEDURES I DON'T SPEAK

00:16:07.966 --> 00:16:09.201
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT -- THAT THEY

00:16:09.268 --> 00:16:10.903
ARE PROHIBITED FROM DOING AT

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:12.504
WITH NATALIE SANCTIONS BUT

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:13.939
POSSIBLY LOSING THEIR JOB IF

00:16:14.006 --> 00:16:15.207
THEY WERE TO SELL.

00:16:15.274 --> 00:16:18.110
OUTSIDE THE THE LAW YES EXCEPT

00:16:18.177 --> 00:16:18.711
THEY CAN TRANSFER TO A FAMILY

00:16:18.777 --> 00:16:20.145
MEMBER GO AHEAD.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:22.181
SOON WE ACTUALLY SUPPORTED IN

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.882
LANGUAGE THREE YEARS AGO THAT

00:16:23.949 --> 00:16:25.584
WOULD CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.453
TRANSFERRED ANYBODY OFFER OSTER

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.887
SO I THINK THERE WAS AN ISSUE

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.255
BACK THEN OF TRANSFER SALE SO WE

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:33.525
ULTIMATELY LIMITED LIMITED

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:35.627
ELIMINATED THAT AS WELL THE TIME.

00:16:35.694 --> 00:16:36.929
BUT NOT THE INHERENT INHERITANCE

00:16:36.995 --> 00:16:38.330
ISSUE BUT EIGHT ANY SAILOR

00:16:38.397 --> 00:16:39.565
TRANSFER RATE.

00:16:39.631 --> 00:16:41.066
BUT WE MAY NEED TO MAKE IT

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.203
EXPLICIT IN THIS BILL DEFINITELY

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:45.571
RIGHT YES WE SHOULD.

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:47.306
OKAY -- CENTER BRADFORD I'M JUST

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:47.806
TRYING TO GET A BETTER

00:16:47.873 --> 00:16:50.142
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:51.210
CONSIDERED UNLAWFUL BECAUSE THE

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:52.478
STATE'S.

00:16:52.544 --> 00:16:54.446
ABILITY TO CONCEAL ANXIOUS ABOUT

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:56.315
ANY GOT A WEAPON YOU'RE ABLE TO

00:16:56.382 --> 00:17:00.119
CONCEAL SO CAN YOU FOR THE

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.153
DIFFERENT LINE.

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.789
SO THERE IS A THERE'S A PROCESS

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.624
IN WHICH THE MANUFACTURER HAS TO

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.693
PAY A FEE TO DOJ AND IT GOES

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:09.194
THROUGH CERTAIN TESTING.

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:09.862
AND THEIR CERTAIN

00:17:09.928 --> 00:17:11.029
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WEAPONS

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.399
SUCH AS HAVING A FOR EXAMPLE

00:17:13.465 --> 00:17:14.900
CHAMBER LOAD INDICATOR HAS TO GO

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.468
THROUGH A DROP TEST SO THERE'S A

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:17.403
NUMBER OF THINGS THAT.

00:17:17.469 --> 00:17:19.104
SIMPLY THE MANUFACTURE GOES

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:21.306
THROUGH THAT PROCESS PAYS A FEE

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:22.775
AND THEN IT'S CONSIDERED ON

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:26.178
pIN THE STATE AT THIS POINT

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.913
EFFECTIVELY WITH THE EXCEPTION

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.182
OF THESE FEW -- AGENCIES IN

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:33.185
APARTMENTS KERRY NON ROSTER

00:17:33.252 --> 00:17:39.625
FIREARMS.

00:17:39.691 --> 00:17:42.394
OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

YOU ARE ON THE SAFE HAND GUNS

00:17:56.608 --> 00:17:57.876

YOU'VE PAID THE FEE YOU'RE NOT.

00:18:00.078 --> 00:18:02.414
NOT AS NOT BASED ON WHETHER THE

HAND GUN IS SAFER NOT TO TO PAY

00:18:05.017 --> 00:18:06.452

AND I DON'T UNDERGO THE TEST

00:18:13.459 --> 00:18:17.596
IT'S CONSIDERED OFF ROSTER.

POINT YEAH I DO AND AND IN THE

00:18:24.803 --> 00:18:27.005
CONFUSION ALSO IS AROUND THE

WORD SAY FORCES ON SAFE ROSTER

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.542
OFF OF ON RIGH NON ROSTER SO

00:18:30.609 --> 00:18:31.877
THAT'S WERE.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.344
THOSE TERMS ARE USED

00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:37.149
INTERCHANGEABLY SO OFF ROSTER.

00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:38.817
BUT THE NOMENCLATURE THEN IS IT

00:18:38.884 --> 00:18:41.186
IS CONSIDERED UNSAFE UNSAFE BUT

00:18:41.253 --> 00:18:41.987
BUT IN.

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:43.555
COMMON VERNACULAR.

00:18:43.622 --> 00:18:44.089
IT'S STATE ISN'T THE SAME

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.325

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.496
ALL THIS IS A LOT OF THE SAME

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.130
MECHANISMS I THINK IT'S SOME

00:18:52.197 --> 00:18:53.532
ADDITIONAL ITEMS.

00:18:53.599 --> 00:18:55.534
THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED --

00:18:55.601 --> 00:18:57.035
WHEN THE STATUE WANTED TO KICK

00:18:57.102 --> 00:18:59.037
IN THE PLACE THAT THAT IN ORDER

00:18:59.104 --> 00:19:00.372

THE REASON THAT THERE DEEMED

00:19:18.156 --> 00:19:19.725
UNSAFE AS THEY HAVEPAID THE FEE.

00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:21.560
BUT IN SOME INSTANCES THESE

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:23.128
FARMS ARE AND SAFE YOUR

00:19:23.195 --> 00:19:25.898
RESPECTIVE THE FEAR NOT IS IN

00:19:25.964 --> 00:19:29.067

00:19:32.137 --> 00:19:34.039
MAYBE SOME.

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.874
WITHIN THE STATE THAT ARE UNSAFE

00:19:35.941 --> 00:19:37.242
I'M ONLY DISCUSSING WHAT

00:19:37.309 --> 00:19:40.012

TECHNICALLY CONSIDERED UNSAFE AS

I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE THE

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.249
TRANSFER BUT I'M ALSO.

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.785
WELL I APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS --

00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:00.419
THAT THESE ARE HAND GUNS THAT

ON THE JOB AND ARE PURCHASED BY

00:22:05.323 --> 00:22:07.592
THE AGENCIES I AM WONDERING WHY

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.995
IS IT THAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY

00:22:10.062 --> 00:22:11.997
THE OFFICER WOULD HAVE THAT AS

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:13.498
PART OF THEIR JOB.

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.633
WHY WOULD WE ALLOW FOR THE

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:23.775
PERSONAL PURCHASE?

00:22:23.842 --> 00:22:24.443
SURE YOU TALK ABOUT THE OFFICERS

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:25.877
THEMSELVES HAVE PERSONAL

00:22:25.944 --> 00:22:27.245
PURCHASE OVER THAT THAT'S RIGHT

00:22:27.312 --> 00:22:29.414
OR STAND.

00:22:29.481 --> 00:22:31.049
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW.

00:22:31.116 --> 00:22:32.684
ALSO THEY'RE THEY'RE ALREADY

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.154
PERMITTED ON DUTY I I THINK

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:37.656
THERE'S LIKE DUDE RIGHT PLEASES.

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:38.690
AND THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:40.092
THEIR PERMITTED ON DUTY THAT

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:41.293
THEY WOULDN'T BE PERMITTED OFF

00:22:41.359 --> 00:22:43.195
DUTY.

00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:46.398
SO THE ARGUMENT BEING IF IF THIS

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:47.966
IS PERMITTED THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.134

ALSO PURCHASE THESE PERSONALLY

00:22:53.405 --> 00:22:54.639
IS AT THE CONGESTION.

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.875
YES THEY WOULD PERSON PURCHASE

00:22:56.942 --> 00:23:06.151
THEM PERSONALLY -- I I DON'T

00:23:06.218 --> 00:23:08.120
HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR FOR THAT

00:23:08.186 --> 00:23:09.254
I'D EIGHT I MEAN IF THEY'RE

00:23:09.321 --> 00:23:11.223

AT THAT POINT WHAT WE DO.

00:23:14.593 --> 00:23:16.161
TO PRECLUDE THAT FROM PERSONAL

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.063

CONSIDERED THE EXAM THEY'RE

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:23.301

OR AS WE HAVE OPPOSE LESS

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:10.949
AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:12.951
HOW FOR A WHILE -- AS WAS

00:29:13.017 --> 00:29:14.919
INDICATED ON THE ORIGINAL BILL --

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.154
WE WERE OPPOSED TO IT AT THAT

00:29:16.221 --> 00:29:17.722
TIME WE WERE INVOLVED IN SOME OF

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:20.592
THE DISCUSSIONS -- WE WE ARE NOT --

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.594
CONVINCED OF THE USE OF FLASH

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.796
INCARCERATION IN THE WAY THAT IT

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.498
WAS STRUCTURED IN REGIONAL BILL --

00:29:26.564 --> 00:29:28.099
WE'RE CERTAINLY STILL NOT

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.167
CONVINCED THAT IS THE RIGHT WAY

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:31.803
TO GO -- SO FOR THOSE REASONS

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:32.971
YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND TO SUNSET

00:29:33.037 --> 00:29:34.973
EXTENSION ARE PART OF THE REASON

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:35.573
WHY WE HAD TO SUNSET IN THE

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.075
FIRST PLACE.

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:39.277
WAS TO REVIEW HOW WAS BEING USED

00:29:39.344 --> 00:29:41.746
TO DETERMINE WHAT KINDS OF CASES

00:29:41.813 --> 00:29:43.014
WHEN WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:44.949
REVIEW AND ASSESS.

00:29:45.016 --> 00:29:45.950
MAYBE A DIFFERENT APPROACH

00:29:46.017 --> 00:29:47.652
DIFFERENT CRITERIA THE USE OF

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:49.988
THAT -- NOT FAMILIAR WITH AN IN

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:52.023
DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE LAW UP

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:53.658
UNTIL THIS POINT ON WHICH

00:29:53.725 --> 00:29:54.359
CERTAINLY DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM

00:29:54.425 --> 00:29:55.627
THE AUTHORS HAVING GOOD

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:56.227
INTENTION OF TRYING TO EXTEND

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:58.129
SOMETHING -- BUT IT IS SOMETHING

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:59.764
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:02.133
DONE NOW IS PART OF THE POINT OF

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.735
THE OF THE SUNSET ON HAVE TO

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.236
REMIND YOU THAT AT THE TIME.

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.804
THAT THE THAT THIS THIS BILL

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:08.439
WENT FORWARD THE ORIGINAL ONE

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:10.608
FORWARD -- THERE WAS A HEAVY

00:30:10.675 --> 00:30:12.877
DEBATE OVER PROP OF THIRTY SIX

00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:14.612
FOR A PROP THIRTY SIX THERE

00:30:14.679 --> 00:30:16.181
WASN'T A LOT OF FUNDING FOR DRUG.

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:17.982
OF CANCELING AND TREATMENT AND

00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:19.684
SO WE WANTED THE BIG FIGHT OVER

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:21.352
THIS KINDS OF KIND OF THING AND

00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.820
THIS WAS KIND OF BROUGHT UP.

00:30:22.887 --> 00:30:24.255
AS A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS

00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:25.490
ACTUALLY WENT TO TREATMENT AND

00:30:25.557 --> 00:30:27.192
REALLY FOLLOW THROUGH WHAT WE

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:28.726
KEPT SAYING IS THERE NEED TO BE

00:30:28.793 --> 00:30:30.261
MORE FUNDING FOR DRUG TREATMENT.

00:30:30.328 --> 00:30:31.829
MORE AVAILABILITY AND THAT WAS

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:33.298
SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE AGREED.

00:30:33.364 --> 00:30:34.732
TO THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED THAT

00:30:34.799 --> 00:30:35.633
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.168
TO BE LOOKED AT GOING FORWARD

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:38.102
THE MAJOR TREATMENT MORE

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:40.438
AVAILABLE IN MAY BE OFFSET THE

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:42.240
NEED FOR FLASH CAR SERRATION.

00:30:42.307 --> 00:30:43.041
ALSO THAT THERE BE LESS

00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:44.742
INSTANCES OF THAT -- AND

00:30:44.809 --> 00:30:45.677
CERTAINLY THAT WAS KIND OF ON

00:30:45.743 --> 00:30:53.384
THE TAIL END OF THE OF THE

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:54.419
RECESSION SO THE UPSIDE AND

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:55.086
DOWNSIDE OF ME BEING AROUND FOR

00:30:55.153 --> 00:30:55.753
A LONG TIME ON HIS PUBLIC SAFETY

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:56.387
BILLS IS THAT.

00:30:56.454 --> 00:30:56.955
YOU KNOW I KIND OF KNOW THE

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:57.622
TRAJECTORY OF THIS BILLS IN THE

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.656
POLICY -- AND SO WE'RE KIND OF

00:30:58.723 --> 00:31:00.225
IN THIS KIND OF STRANGE

00:31:00.291 --> 00:31:02.227
SITUATION WHERE -- IT WAS HIGHLY

00:31:02.293 --> 00:31:04.128
DEBATED EVEN THOUGH WHEN FORWARD

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:06.030
A FEW YEARS BACK -- THERE'S A

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.131
LOT OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO

00:31:07.198 --> 00:31:07.999
HAPPEN FOR SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN

00:31:08.066 --> 00:31:09.267
WE'RE HOPING WOULD HAPPEN SINCE

00:31:09.334 --> 00:31:10.969
THEN HAVEN'T QUITE HAPPENED. FOR

00:31:11.035 --> 00:31:11.936
THOSE REASONS WE HAVE TAKEN

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.504
OPPOSE POSITION THE RESPECT THE

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:15.673
AUTHOR -- WHO WHO IS VERY GOOD

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.841
ON THESE ISSUES AND VERY

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.409
THOUGHTFUL ON THESE ISSUES --

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.178
BUT UNFORTUNATELY -- SOME THE

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:21.379
WORK I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DONE

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:22.747
SINCE THE ORIGINAL LAW -- WE

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:25.149
DON'T THINK IT'S HAS TOTALLY

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.685
BEEN DONE FOR THOSE REASONS HAVE

00:31:27.752 --> 00:31:28.620
OPPOSE AWESOME AND I HAVE A

00:31:28.686 --> 00:31:31.189
QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION.

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:31.889
SOME OF THE SUNSET IS AN

00:31:31.956 --> 00:31:33.658
EXTENDED.

00:31:33.725 --> 00:31:35.860
THEN IS THE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:40.198
FROM READING THE ANALYSIS IS.

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.500
THE IT WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:42.967
PUT.

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.004
THE PERSON AT THE PROBATION BY

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.138
LATER IN FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY

00:31:47.205 --> 00:31:49.107
DAYS.

00:31:49.173 --> 00:31:52.110
AND WITHOUT THIS DOUBT.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:56.047
I MEAN. FOR ME THE I'M NOT EVEN

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.115
NECESSARILY COMFORTABLE WITH

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.917
FLASH INCARCERATION JUST BECAUSE

00:31:59.984 --> 00:32:02.320
WHEN WE HAVE FOLKS -- IN THIS

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:04.956
CIRCUMSTANCE WE WANT WE ARE

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:07.258
HOPING THAT THEY ARE -- STARTING

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:09.093
TO FUNCTION APPROPRIATELY AND

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.795
THE COMMUNITY THEY HAVE A JOB

00:32:10.862 --> 00:32:12.497
THEY HAVE AND OF COURSE WE KNOW

00:32:12.563 --> 00:32:14.599
THAT ANY DETENTION INTERFERES

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.367
WITH THEIR ABILITY.

00:32:16.434 --> 00:32:18.536
TO CONTINUE THEIR EMPLOYMENT TO

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:20.438
CONTINUE WHATEVER WORK THEY WERE

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:23.274
DOING TO BE A SUCCESSFUL OR

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:27.578
REENTRY -- HOWEVER A LONGER TIME

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.247
A DETENTION SEEMS TO BE VERY

00:32:29.314 --> 00:32:31.249
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SO IF YOU

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.150
COULD ADDRESS THAT.

00:32:32.216 --> 00:32:33.718
YEAH WELL I APPRECIATE AND I

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:35.019
THINK SOME OF THE FOCUS ON MIGHT

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:36.721
BE COVERED BY THINK THE BILL

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:37.622
THOSE HEARD EARLIER TODAY FROM

00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:41.059
NOT FROM NOT MISTAKEN -- BUT YES --

00:32:41.125 --> 00:32:42.660
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE

00:32:42.727 --> 00:32:44.062
DO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:46.130
LOOKED AT AS SOME SORT OF

00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:47.098
ALTERNATIVE TO THAT WHICH WE

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:50.268
THOUGHT WAS GOOD BUT WE WE

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.069
DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT.

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:52.670
I GUESS MY ANSWER TO THAT IS.

00:32:52.737 --> 00:32:53.805
WHAT WE SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.907
A OF THE ORIGINAL LAW WHICH IS

00:32:55.973 --> 00:32:58.142
FASHION CORPORATION BY ITSELF IS

00:32:58.209 --> 00:32:59.377
NOT THE WAY TO GO THAT THERE

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:00.978
SHOULD BE OTHER ALTERNATIVES AND

00:33:01.045 --> 00:33:02.113
THERE SHOULD BE DIGITAL FUNDING

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:02.380
SO THAT?

00:33:02.447 --> 00:33:04.315
FASHION COURSE RATIONS IS ONE OF

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:06.384
THE LAST RESORTS -- FOR

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:08.086
INDIVIDUALS AND SO THAT'S WHY

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:08.886
IT'S IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT

00:33:08.953 --> 00:33:10.655
DIRECTLY BECAUSE I THINK THE

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.056
ANSWER IS THAT AMENDED SOME OF

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:13.191
THE CRITERIA.

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.125
HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:15.493
AVAILABLE AND AND MAKING SURE

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.294
THAT THERE'S A SUSTAINED

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.596
OPPORTUNITY FOR FOLKS TO SUCCEED.

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:20.665
I THINK THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:22.133
THAT THERE THERE MAY BE AS SOME

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.135
PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WERE

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:25.236
BENEFITS BUT FOR THE VAST

00:33:25.303 --> 00:33:27.271
MAJORITY FLASHCARTS RATIONS

00:33:27.338 --> 00:33:28.706
UNNECESSARYGONNA KICK THEM INTO.

00:33:28.773 --> 00:33:32.343
NO BETTER JOB TREATMENT SO I

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:33.411
DON'T KNOW THAT.

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:34.512
WE'RE SAYING GET RID OF THE

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:35.446
SUNSET AND THEN LET GO BACK TO

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:36.180
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS I THINK

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.082
WE'RE LOOKING AT LET'S LET'S.

00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:39.517
MOVE THIS AROUND A LITTLE BIT

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:41.252
LET'S MANIPULATE A LITTLE BIT SO

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:41.986
THAT THERE ARE OTHER

00:33:42.053 --> 00:33:43.888
ALTERNATIVES AND BETTER WAYS TO

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:44.555
DO IT AND I THINK THAT WAS WERE

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:45.590
ORIGINAL.

00:33:45.656 --> 00:33:46.891
COMPOSITIONS I DO APOLOGIZE TO

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:48.426
THE CHAIR OF I'VE I'VE CHARMS

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:49.427

THROUGH WHAT SOME OF THE

00:33:52.296 --> 00:33:55.099
ALTERNATIVES -- COULD BE BUT

00:33:55.166 --> 00:33:56.667
CERTAINLY WILLING OF THIS AS

00:33:56.734 --> 00:33:58.102
SOON THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:01.506
HAVE DISCUSSIONS IF THERE'S WAYS

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:02.206
THAT WE CAN TREAT THIS GOING

00:34:02.273 --> 00:34:05.977
FORWARD -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEVINE

00:34:06.043 --> 00:34:07.378

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:08.346
MUCH MADAM CHAIR I DID WANT TO

00:34:10.314 --> 00:34:12.083
VOLUNTARY OPTION.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:14.652
THAT IS RARELY -- TURNED DOWN AT

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:16.687
ALL AND MISS CENTERS HAD SOME

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.322
COMMENTS FOR CLARIFICATION FROM

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.958
THE THE OPPOSITIONISTS POINTS I

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:21.893
NEED TO THE CHAIR.

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:23.594
I JUST BRIEFLY -- WE WE AGREE

00:34:23.661 --> 00:34:24.629
THAT FLASHING CONSERVATION

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:26.464
SHOULD NOT BE THE THE FIRST --

00:34:26.531 --> 00:34:28.332
ALTERNATIVE TO A VIOLATION IT'S

00:34:28.399 --> 00:34:30.601
DEPENDED UPON REALLY -- THE TYPE

00:34:30.668 --> 00:34:32.503
OF VIOLATION AND WE WANT TO ALSO

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:33.604
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A GRADUATED

00:34:33.671 --> 00:34:34.806
SANCTIONS SO ONE OF THE THINGS

00:34:34.872 --> 00:34:35.940
BUILT INTO THE BILL.

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:38.176
REQUIRES A BEHAVIOR MATRIX WHICH

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.677
IS BASED ON RESEARCH AND

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:41.045
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES TO SAY

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.280
THAT -- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:44.081
CONTINUE ON THE TYPES OF

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.349
VIOLATIONS AND THIS WOULD ONLY

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.285
BE IMPLEMENTED AND IN THE CASE

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:49.220
IN WHICH THE ALTERNATIVE WOULD

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.122
BE THE EXISTING COURT REVOCATION

00:34:51.189 --> 00:34:52.356
PROCESS SO CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:55.159
INTENDED -- TO UPON MINOR THINGS

00:34:55.226 --> 00:34:56.661
WE WANT TO KEEP THE PERSON --

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.029
UNDER OUR CARE AND SUPERVISION

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.597
ON TRACK AND IF IT BECOMES A

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:00.631
THING WHERE THEY MISSED AN

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:01.999
APPOINTMENT WE WANT TO SAY THAT

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:04.035
SEAL AS LONG AS WE CAN RESET

00:35:04.101 --> 00:35:05.069
THAT AND CONTINUE WORKING LET'S

00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:06.003
DO SO.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.171
BUT IF IT'S A SIGNIFICANT THING

00:35:07.238 --> 00:35:09.507
THAT THEY DON'T SIGN UP -- FOR

00:35:09.574 --> 00:35:11.242
THEY DON'T REGISTER -- FOR AS A

00:35:11.309 --> 00:35:13.110
SEX OFFENDER OR SOMETHING THAT

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.212
RISES TO A LEVEL BASED ON THAT

00:35:14.278 --> 00:35:15.513
MATRIX THIS WOULD THEN BE

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.248
IMPLEMENTED AGAIN IT'S STILL

00:35:17.315 --> 00:35:20.117
VOLUNTARY ON THE PERSON'S BEHALF --

00:35:20.184 --> 00:35:21.686
THE AVERAGES AS AS WE'VE SEEN

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:22.920
STATEWIDE IS LESS THAN THE TEN

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.322
DAY MAXIMUM I KNOW THAT'S BEEN

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:25.890
SOMETHING THAT'S COME UP SO I

00:35:25.957 --> 00:35:27.325
THINK REALLY IN PRACTICE WHAT WE

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:29.060
SEEN ON A WITH THE SAFEGUARDS AT

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.361
THIS COMMITTEE IN ASSEMBLY

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:31.863
PUBLIC SAFETY HAS BUILT IN --

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:34.031
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY VERY HELPFUL

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:34.899
TO THE DEFENDANT AND THE PERSON

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:40.037
ON PROBATION -- TO BALANCE ALL

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.372
OF THOSE THINGS.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:42.273
SENATOR JACKSON'S.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.041
THANK YOU HI I AM.

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.377
I GUESS THE THING MIND --

00:35:46.444 --> 00:35:48.412
WONDERING ABOUT TODAY IS.

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.147
ARE WE FUNDING THESE

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:52.817
ALTERNATIVES APPROPRIATELY WE WE

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:53.417
KNOW THE PUTTING JUST PUTTING

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:54.752
PEOPLE IN.

00:35:54.819 --> 00:35:56.120
JAIL AND PRISON IS NOT THE

00:35:56.187 --> 00:35:58.990
ANSWER.

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:00.591
BUT WE DO AND WE DO KNOW THAT

00:36:00.658 --> 00:36:02.193
SOME OF THE ANSWERS TREATMENT.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.795
AND EDUCATION AND THEIR WHOLE

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:06.664
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF THINGS.

00:36:06.731 --> 00:36:08.733
BUT MY QUESTION IS ARE WE DOING

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:10.902
THOSE THINGS -- I THINK THAT'S

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.603
CRITICAL BECAUSE IF WE'RE NOT

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.171
SUCCESSFUL WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.740
BACK TO THE OLD WAY OF JUST

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.074
THROWING PEOPLE.

00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:20.144
IN PRISON AND THROW AWAY THE KEY

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:20.678
WHICH I THINK WOULD BE A

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:22.947
TERRIBLE.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:25.349
TRAGEDY YEAH -- SO -- IF I MAY

00:36:25.416 --> 00:36:26.951
JUST ASK YOU.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:29.487
WHAT IS THE THE GOAL AND THEN

00:36:29.554 --> 00:36:31.422
THE AND IS THERE A MEASURE OF

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:35.026
SUCCESS FOR FLASH INCARCERATION?

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:36.994
YEAH IF IF I MAY TO THE CHAIR

00:36:37.061 --> 00:36:37.995
THE IT REALLY IS BASED ON

00:36:38.062 --> 00:36:39.630
RESEARCH NATIONAL RESEARCH THAT

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:41.599
TALKS ABOUT -- GRADUATED

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.334
SANCTIONS AND AND A SWIFT AND

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:45.836
CERTAIN SANCTIONS SO AGAIN WHERE

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.138
WHERE SOMETHING RISES TO THE

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:49.206
LEVEL OF NEEDING -- TO

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.575
POTENTIALLY VIOLATE THAT PERSON

00:36:50.641 --> 00:36:52.076
OR OR HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE IT'S

00:36:52.143 --> 00:36:55.212
IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS FOR A VERY

00:36:55.279 --> 00:36:57.148
QUICK KIND OF INTERVENTION.

00:36:57.214 --> 00:36:58.983
BUT IT IS LEAST DISRUPTIVE AS

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.017
POSSIBLE TO ALL OF THE OTHER

00:37:00.084 --> 00:37:00.918
THINGS BECAUSE OF WHEN THEY ARE

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.420
ON PROBATION WE'RE WORKING WITH

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:03.921
THEM TO GET THEM CONNECTED.

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:04.822
TO SUBSTANCE USE THE TREATMENT

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.557
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY GET

00:37:06.624 --> 00:37:08.459
THEM INTO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:37:08.526 --> 00:37:09.794
SO ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.628
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WE'RE

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.129
WORKING TOWARDS AND SO WE

00:37:12.196 --> 00:37:13.464
CERTAINLY ARE INVESTED IN NOT

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.932
WANTING TO DISRUPT THAT WHERE

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:16.233
THERE'S PROGRESS.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.234
BUT AGAIN WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.336
SURE THAT THE IF THERE IS A

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:20.104
SIGNIFICANT VIOLATION THAT WERE

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.672
HAVING THAT VERY QUICK

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.274
APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION AND TO

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:24.976
THEN GET BACK ON TRACK.

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.277
AND AND THEY ARE BEING MONITORED

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:31.816
APPROPRIATELY ABSOLUTELY.

00:37:31.882 --> 00:37:32.083
THANK YOU.

00:37:32.149 --> 00:37:36.153
I'M OF THE BILL.

ANY OTHER DISCUSSION AND RICE --

00:37:37.888 --> 00:37:39.757
AS WE MOVE THIS BILL I HOPE THE

00:37:39.824 --> 00:37:41.025
ASSEMBLY WERE LIVING YOU MIGHT

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.426
