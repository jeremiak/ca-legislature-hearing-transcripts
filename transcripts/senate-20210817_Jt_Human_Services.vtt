DO HAVE EXPERIENCE OF WORKING

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.044
WITH OUR NATIONAL ASSOCIATION

00:54:41.111 --> 00:54:41.845
WAS ACTUALLY THERE WHEN THEY

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:43.113
STARTED THE DATA COLLECTION

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:44.948
SYSTEM SO. CURRENTLY WE'RE

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.250
UNDER THE SECOND MODEL OF THAT

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:48.818
DATA COLLECTION HOW WE DO THAT

00:54:48.885 --> 00:54:51.154
NOW THAT IS SET. FROM OCS

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.368
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA

00:55:05.435 --> 00:55:06.903
AND HOW WE USE THAT WAS FIRST

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:08.238
ALL THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE

00:55:08.304 --> 00:55:10.040
DO COLLECT IS THE DEMOGRAPHICS.

00:55:10.106 --> 00:55:11.107
OF ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.275
MAJORITY OF FAMILIES THAT WE

00:55:12.342 --> 00:55:14.444
SERVE. THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:15.612
MAY BE YOU KNOW A

00:55:15.679 --> 00:55:17.113
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM WHERE

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.782
SOMEONE'S USING. NO PUBLIC

00:55:18.848 --> 00:55:19.849
TRANSIT WHERE YOU CAN GET ALL

00:55:19.916 --> 00:55:21.317
THE DEMOGRAPHICS ON EVERYBODY

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.752
THAT GETS ON AND OFF OF. A

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.454
PUBLIC VEHICLE- BUT FOR THE

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.556
MOST PART WE DO COLLECT ALL

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.057
DEMOGRAPHICS OF ALL THE

00:55:27.123 --> 00:55:28.625
FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. AND

00:55:28.692 --> 00:55:29.826
WE'RE CONSTANTLY COMPARE THAT

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.028
NOT JUST TO OUR POPULATIONS OF

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.563
YOU WANNA LOOK AT SPECIFICALLY

00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:34.431
WITH THE ASIAN POPULATION IN

00:55:34.497 --> 00:55:37.267
CALIFORNIA- IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:39.269
15% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. OR

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.270
AS WE KNOW THAT IT'S ONLY NINE

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.205
POINT 9% OF THE POVERTY

00:55:42.272 --> 00:55:43.473
POPULATION ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.041
LOOK AT THE PUMP. POPULATION

00:55:45.108 --> 00:55:45.975
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE

00:55:46.042 --> 00:55:47.243
UP TO THIS YEAR WHICH IS ONLY A

00:55:47.310 --> 00:55:48.978
100% OF THE POVERTY LINE. SO

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:50.313
WE'RE ONLY CURRENTLY SERVING

00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.681
FOUR POINT NINE TO FIVE POINT

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:53.416
2% OF THAT SO THERE STILL IS A

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.218
GAP OF FOUR PERCENT. AND WE

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:56.419
WE'RE VERY AWARE THAT

00:55:56.486 --> 00:55:57.487
UNDERSTANDING THAT IT'S HOW WE

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:59.322
POPULATE. OUR AGENCIES THAT WE

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.557
STAFF THOSE AGENCIES TO MAKE

00:56:00.623 --> 00:56:01.257
SURE THEY WERE IN THE CORRECT

00:56:01.324 --> 00:56:02.792
COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WERE MORE

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:04.060
A LOT OF THAT WE CLOSELY WORK

00:56:04.127 --> 00:56:05.662
TO THAT. THE OTHER TWO PARTS OF

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:07.564
R. IN REPORT ON THAT WE LOOK AT

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:09.132
AND UNDERSTANDING OUR DATA. IS

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.266
BOTH LOOKING AT OUR SERVICE

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:11.868
DATA ENTERED HALFTIME DATA IN

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:13.203
AND HOW THAT MATCHES TOGETHER.

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:14.104
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:15.705
MAKE SURE WE DO IS

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:16.272
UNDERSTANDING THE PEOPLE TO

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.141
COME INTO OUR OFFICE. AND WHAT

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:20.810
SERVICES THEY RECEIVE. AND THEN

00:56:20.877 --> 00:56:21.745
ONE OF THOSE TIMES RECEIVE

00:56:21.811 --> 00:56:22.812
SERVICES ONE OF THE TYPE OF

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.614
OUTCOMES THAT THEY HAVE. WE

00:56:24.681 --> 00:56:25.381
LOOK AT ALL DIFFERENT AREAS SO

00:56:25.448 --> 00:56:26.816
WE LOOK AT. YOUR POINT WE LOOK

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.585
AT HOUSING WE LOOK AT EDUCATION

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.386
ALL THOSE MAJOR OUTCOMES. THAT

00:56:30.453 --> 00:56:31.454
YOU SEE ACROSS WHETHER YOU'RE

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:32.222
LOOKING AT A WORK FORCE

00:56:32.288 --> 00:56:33.990
PROGRAM. YOU LOOK AT A HOUSING

00:56:34.057 --> 00:56:35.558
PROGRAM WHATEVER IT MAY BE. SO

00:56:35.625 --> 00:56:36.459
WHAT WE DO WITH THAT

00:56:36.526 --> 00:56:38.194
INFORMATION IS BILLS SAY. WHO

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.596
GOT THE SERVICE AND WHO HAD

00:56:39.662 --> 00:56:40.463
OUTCOME AND WHAT'S THE

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.132
DIFFERENCE IN THOSE PEOPLE SO.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.266
IT'S A PRETTY ADVANCED SYSTEM

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:44.834
WE CAN DEFINITELY SUPPLY. THAT

00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:47.137
FULL REPORT TO YOU. ULTIMATELY

00:56:47.203 --> 00:56:48.204
WE TRY TO DO IS BREAK IT DOWN

00:56:48.271 --> 00:56:49.305
SO THAT IT'S A IT'S A SHORTER

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:51.508
VERSION OF THAT REPORT- SO

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.509
THERE'S NOT JUST SUCH A MASS

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:53.777
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION. BUT DUE

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.111
TO OUR AGENCIES USE THAT

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.379
INFORMATION AS A PART OF THEIR

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:57.113
NEEDS ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:03.453
ASSESSMENT. TO UNDERSTAND NOT

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.220
ONLY THE POVERTY COPULATIONS IN

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.288
CALIFORNIA. BUT HOW DOES IT CAN.

00:57:05.355 --> 00:57:06.189
THE POPULATION THAT WE SAW. IN

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:06.790
SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES THAT

00:57:06.856 --> 00:57:09.793
THEY HAVE. THANK THANK IF I CAN

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:11.060

FACT THAT THE ASIAN COMMUNITY

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:17.200
AND I THINK THE KEY I CAN IS

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:18.134
ONLY REPRESENTS POINT THREE

00:57:18.201 --> 00:57:21.004
PERCENT- IT'S REPORTED THAT

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:25.742
BY THIS PROGRAM- I WAS TO MAKE

OF THE DATA I CAN. I THINK

THERE'S MANY SUBGROUPS- OF THE-

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:39.589
OF THE API COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:42.892
PARTICULARLY- LOW INCOME AND

00:57:42.959 --> 00:57:44.127
POVERTY THAT WOULD BE SERVED BY

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.628
THIS PROGRAM AND TO BE GOOD TO

01:02:10.726 --> 01:02:12.762
PICTURE TO HELP TO INFORM THE

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:15.998

ABSOLUTELY- WE DO NOT HAVE A

FROM THE TIME THAT COMMUNITY

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:15.992
NEEDS ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.393

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.263
PLAN. THROUGHOUT THE TWO YEAR

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.064
CYCLE THAT- THE C. S. B. G.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:23.533
PROGRAM WILL OPERATE UNDER THE

01:03:23.599 --> 01:03:26.235
STATE PLAN AND SO THAT. LOCAL

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:28.104
CCG AGENCIES WILL MAINTAIN

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.872
THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND WILL

01:03:29.939 --> 01:03:32.575
CONTINUALLY ASSESS THE NEEDS OF

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:33.576
THE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS THAT

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:35.478
THEY SERVE. TO ENSURE THAT CSU

01:03:35.545 --> 01:03:36.979
G. FUNDS IF THEY RECEIVE HER

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:38.948
BEING ADMINISTERED TO ASK THE

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:41.017
RESULTS AS A RESULT TO ANY

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:42.752
EMERGENCIES THAT COULD HAPPEN-

01:03:42.818 --> 01:03:44.320
JOB RELATED TO WILDFIRES FOR

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:45.588
EXAMPLE THAT WE NOW HAVE-

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.190
CLOSURES UP IN EL DORADO COUNTY

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:49.325
THAT COULD IMPACT- SOME C. S.

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.494
B. G. AGENCIES THERE- AS WELL

01:03:51.561 --> 01:03:53.462
AS- ON GOING DROUGHT. AND SO

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.331
WHILE THE STATE PLAN DOES LOOK

01:03:55.398 --> 01:03:56.199
AT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.334
ASSESSMENTS IN A POINT IN TIME-

01:03:58.401 --> 01:03:59.936
IT IS ALMOST AS IF A LIVING

DOCUMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE A

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:04.440
FLEXIBLE OVER TWO YEAR PERIOD-

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:05.808
AND THAT THEY THEY WILL

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:06.842
CONTINUE TO DO THIS COMMUNITY

01:04:06.909 --> 01:04:08.678
NEEDS ASSESSMENT. AGAIN FOR THE

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.479
NEXT PLAN BUT WHY DO YOU

01:04:10.546 --> 01:04:13.516
UNDERSTAND THAT- THE THAT YOUR

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.017
DESIRE TO HAVE FOR THE

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:16.385
LEGISLATURE DESIRE TO HAVE A

01:04:16.452 --> 01:04:18.087

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.122
OR THE AGENCIES- AND THAT IS

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:25.494
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK. TO-

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:26.128
TO HANDLE HERE IN THE FUTURE. I

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.296
ALSO A- WHAT YOU'RE- OF THE-

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:28.864

COMMUNITY NEEDS WERE. BUT I DO

01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:39.742
THINK THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE FOR

01:04:39.809 --> 01:04:42.478
US TO TRACK OVER TIME WHAT HAS

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.413
BEEN CHANGING AS WELL AND-

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.514
HENCE WHY I THINK IT'S

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:48.351
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:48.918

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:27.456
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT-

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:30.626
WHY IS THAT AMOUNT OR THAT

01:05:30.693 --> 01:05:32.762
PERCENTAGE DIFFERENT FOR- AND

01:05:32.828 --> 01:05:35.498
ENTITIES ANDNOT A WISE AND IT

01:05:35.564 --> 01:05:39.769
EVENLY DISTRIBUTED- IT'S MORE I

01:05:39.835 --> 01:05:40.903
GUESS FOR ME TRYING TO

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.071
UNDERSTAND THE WAY THAT SEE A

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.173
SPEECH HE WORKS BUT IF YOU. I

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:44.707
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE AN

01:05:44.774 --> 01:05:47.209
ANSWER TO THAT. HI THERE THE

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:48.678
SIMPLE ANSWER IS THAT THE

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.379
ALLOCATION OF DOG IS OUTLINED

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:52.548
IN THE CODE- AND IT ALSO LOSE

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.517
OF A LONGSTANDING ALLOCATION AS

01:05:54.583 --> 01:05:57.119
IT RELATES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT-

01:05:57.186 --> 01:06:00.489
THE- BEFORE PERCENT- TO-

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:02.792
NATIVE- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA OF

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.193
INDIAN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALSO

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:06.395
INCLUDES OPIATES- THEY GET A

01:06:06.462 --> 01:06:08.998
BASE LEVEL FUNDING AS WELL- IT

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.599
IS A BIT OF A COMPLEX FORMULA.

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.501
FORMULATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:14.203
TO SENATOR- IF YOU WOULD LIKE

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:16.405
TO SEE THAT BUT IT IS. OUTLINED

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.908
AS A AS A CODE SPECIFIC. WAYS

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:20.076
IN WHICH THE THESE DOLLARS ARE

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.544
GOING TO BE PROVIDED TO C. A.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:24.413
S. AND THE OTHER AGENCIES THAT

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.348
TO ADMINISTER C. S. B. G. HERE

01:06:25.414 --> 01:06:27.350
IN CALIFORNIA. GREAT AND JUST A

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.951
COUPLE MORE FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:31.387
TO THAT ONE- WHEN WAS THAT CODE

01:06:31.454 --> 01:06:34.523
LAST REVISITED- THAT. THAT

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:36.192
ALLOCATES THESE PERCENTAGES STE

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.626
THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION AND

01:06:37.693 --> 01:06:39.729
THE SECOND QUESTION. IS WHAT

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:42.732
IS. 11% AND 4% WHAT ARE THESE

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:48.371
PERCENTAGES TRANSLATE WHEN IT.

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.271
COMES TO ACTUAL DOLLARS. I

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:49.872
DON'T KNOW WHEN THE CODE WAS

01:06:49.939 --> 01:06:52.141
READ. AND I CAN PULL THAT

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.743
NUMBER HAVE IT TO YOU HERE IN A

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.044
IN A MATTER OF SECONDS I DON'T

01:06:55.111 --> 01:06:56.178
HAVE THAT AT MY FINGERTIPS

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:58.614
RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE-

01:06:58.681 --> 01:06:59.815
SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS FOR TWENTY

01:06:59.882 --> 01:07:01.484
TWENTY. GOING FORWARD IN THE IN

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.620
THE PLAN. AND THEN I HAVE

01:07:04.687 --> 01:07:06.655
ANOTHER QUESTION IN REGARDS TO

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:07.890
THE DIFFERENCE THE FOR ELIGIBLE

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.526
ENTITIES- IS THAT ALSO

01:07:10.593 --> 01:07:13.129
SOMETHING THAT IS- DETERMINE

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.798
AND CODE- I MEAN THIS OR WAIT

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.033
TOO EXPANDED THE ELIGIBLE

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:21.036
ENTITIES- UNDER- HERE IN

01:07:21.103 --> 01:07:22.571
CALIFORNIA I MEAN I KNOW WE

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.142
HAVE FIFTY TO SEE AS FOR MS F.

01:07:26.208 --> 01:07:29.412
W.'S THREE AND EIGHT EYES AND

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:32.982
FIVE L. P. A.'S- BUT- I. JUST

01:07:33.048 --> 01:07:34.750
YOU KNOW I KNOW THERE IS A

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.952
SIGNIFICANT NEED IS WHAT WHAT'S

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:40.322
THE CRITERIA OR ELIGIBILITY TO.

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.390
BE ABLE TO COME TO BECOME ONE

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:44.460
OF THE AN- ENTITY UNDER ABOUT

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.195
ONE OF THE FOUR. AGAIN THOSE

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:47.763
ARE ESTABLISHED UNDER FEDERAL

01:07:47.830 --> 01:07:49.665
AND STATE LAW AND THE ENTITIES

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:50.366
THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE A

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:51.700
CALIFORNIA ARE GRANDFATHERED

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:55.538
IN- AS FAR AS- THEY'RE THE

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:56.472
THEY'RE JUST LOCKED IN HERE IN

01:07:56.539 --> 01:07:58.274
CALIFORNIA- THERE WOULD HAVE TO

01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.142
BE A PROCESS TO DETERMINE THAT

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:02.011
D. DESIGNATION- THAT GOES

01:08:02.077 --> 01:08:04.980
THROUGH A SERIES OF. OF STEPS

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:06.582
THAT AGAIN IS OUTLINED IN STATE

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:09.351
CO TO- REMOVE A SINGLE ENTITY

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:11.287
AND REPLACE IT WITH ANOTHER AT

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.888
THIS STAGE WE ARE NOT ADDING

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:14.190
ADDITIONAL OR MORE WILL WE GET

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:16.258
THE DISMAL- ENTITIES BECAUSE

01:08:16.325 --> 01:08:17.426
ALL REGIONS OF CALIFORNIANS ARE

01:08:17.493 --> 01:08:21.831
COVERED- BASED ON OUR CURRENT-

01:08:21.897 --> 01:08:23.032
SPREAD ISSUES B. G. AGENCIES.

01:08:23.098 --> 01:08:25.434
SO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT I

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:26.802
UNDERSTOOD IT CLEARLY IT'S

01:08:26.869 --> 01:08:29.472
SOMETHING THAT'S THAT'S- PLACED

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.874
INTO STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ALSO

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:32.475
IS IT THAT THE STATE JUST KIND

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:36.111
OF- GOES WITH WHAT WHAT FEDERAL

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.514
LAW IS ASKING FOR AND WE ABIDE

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:40.950
BY IT OR- I GUESS I NEED A

01:08:41.016 --> 01:08:41.550
LITTLE BIT MORE CLARIFICATION

01:08:41.617 --> 01:08:44.053
ON THAT. HOW IT WAS MORE ABOUT

01:08:44.119 --> 01:08:46.222
AS C. S. B. G. WAS IT IS AND

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:47.957
REGIONALLY ADMINISTERED HERE AT

01:08:48.023 --> 01:08:50.693
THE STATE- ITS LONGSTANDING- A

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:52.595
CODE SECTION AS IT RELATES TO

01:08:52.661 --> 01:08:54.463
WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT A C. S.

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:56.098
B. G. GRANDFATHER AGENCY. AND

01:08:56.165 --> 01:08:59.401
IT GOES BACK TO- THE EARLY

01:08:59.468 --> 01:09:01.804
SIXTIES AND THEN THE CHANGES

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:03.639
THAT HAVE FEDERAL CODE- UNDER

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.574
THE C. S. B. G. ACT. AND WHO

01:09:05.641 --> 01:09:06.842
WILL BE IT WILL NOT BE

01:09:06.909 --> 01:09:08.077
CONSIDERS HIS PROJECTIONS IN

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:09.879
CALIFORNIA SO IT ISN'T

01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:11.981
SOMETHING THAT- TO MY MIND I

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:13.449
DON'T KNOW IF IT'D BEEN LOOKED

01:09:13.516 --> 01:09:15.618
AT- EIGHTY RECENT. TIME BUT

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:19.388
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT. WE CAN

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:19.955
DEFINITELY RESEARCH AND GET

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:22.358
BACK TO YOU ABOUT. THANK YOU- I

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:24.260
ALSO WANTED TO ASK IS

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.228
CALIFORNIA MAXIMIZING THE

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.229
FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT WE

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.332
RECEIVE- TO SEE S. B. G. IS-

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:33.235
OPPORTUNITY DUE TO IMPROVING

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:38.207
GETTING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. I

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:40.042
BELIEVE I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.310
THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING THE

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:42.945
DOLLARS THAT THE EVEN IF WE

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.380
COULD ASK FOR ADDITIONAL

01:09:44.446 --> 01:09:45.347
DOLLARS FROM THE FEDERAL

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:47.349
GOVERNMENT OR OR THE ACTUAL

01:09:47.416 --> 01:09:49.084
EXPENDITURE OF DOLLARS ARE WE

01:09:49.151 --> 01:09:52.154
MAXIMIZING THAT. THAT'S MORE OF

01:09:52.221 --> 01:09:53.389
A GENERAL QUESTION DID DID FROM

01:09:53.455 --> 01:09:55.257
YOUR AND IF THERE'S IF YOU

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:58.294
BELIEVE BUT MAYBE WE COULD-

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.630
EXPAND THOSE DOLLARS- RIGHT. I

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:04.066
THINK THAT- WELL FIRST TO MY

01:10:04.133 --> 01:10:06.902
HOME THE QUESTION WAS- WE THAT

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:07.903
CALIFORNIA DON'T HAVE THE

01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:09.071
ABILITY TO EXPAND ON THE

01:10:09.138 --> 01:10:10.039
FEDERAL DOLLARS THOSE ARE

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.541
ALLOCATED BASED ON- THE- US

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:13.742
CENSUS DATA TRACKING

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:15.611
INFORMATION THAT THAT YOU. WERE

01:10:15.678 --> 01:10:17.379
EXIST THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO

01:10:17.446 --> 01:10:19.148
THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE LOCKED IN

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:22.851
BY THE FEDS. AS FAR AS- ARE WE-

01:10:22.918 --> 01:10:24.386
ADMINISTERING THE DOLLARS IN

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:25.454
THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO LOCAL

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.656
LEVEL- I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.525
WE ARE I THINK WE ARE. I THINK

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.759
THAT THE REPORTING THAT COMES

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:33.596
UP FOR MARK RCCG AGENCY SHOWS A

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:35.297
SIGNIFICANT EIGHT SUPPORT

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:38.067
SERVICES AND OUTCOMES- TO LOW

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:38.834
INCOME CALIFORNIA'S THROUGHOUT

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.070
THE STATE I WOULD INVITE-

01:10:41.136 --> 01:10:42.905
MISTER KNIGHT. AND MR DEVICE

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.840
POTENTIALLY TO SHARE. ANY

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.642
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OR OR

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:47.977
THOUGHTS ON THAT AS WELL IF YOU

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:49.845
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THEM-

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:51.046
BUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT'S POINT

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.181
OF VIEW WE BELIEVE THAT THE

01:10:52.247 --> 01:10:54.883
BOTTOM UP PROGRAM- CCG IS

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:57.987
SERVING. WELCOME CALIFORNIANS-

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.788
THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE AS THEY

01:10:59.855 --> 01:11:01.423
ARE BROKEN OUT BY AGENCY AND BY

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:06.395
THEIR LOCAL. NEEDS AND THEIR

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:08.631
LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. WHAT

01:11:08.697 --> 01:11:11.200
ANY OTHER OF THE SPEAKERS LIKE

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:26.048
TO ADD TO THAT. I WILL JUST

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:27.816
MENTION A DAVID NIGHT OF

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:30.552
ACCOUNTABLE WE HAVE A REQUESTED

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:33.322
ADDITIONAL- FIFTY FIVE MILLION

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:36.091
UP FROM- THE FEDERAL OCS THIS

01:11:36.158 --> 01:11:38.661
YEAR- IS IN THE BUDGET HAS BEEN

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.195
ORIGINALLY PUT IN ABOUT ONE TO

01:11:40.262 --> 01:11:41.964
COMMITTEE SO. THERE IS A HOPE

01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:44.266
TO EXPAND THE C. S. B. G.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:45.100
RECORDS THAT IS SET BY THE

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.703
FANS. AND YOU KNOW THE MAJORITY

01:11:47.770 --> 01:11:49.271
THE FLEXIBILITY DOES COME IN IN

01:11:49.338 --> 01:11:50.606
THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING OF

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:51.774
THE STATE YOU KNOW FOR THE

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.642
ABILITY TO CREATE A BE CREATIVE

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.110
AS A STATEWIDE. WELL THE

01:11:55.177 --> 01:11:57.112
MAJORITY OF THE REST OF THE 90%

01:11:57.179 --> 01:11:58.480
OF IT IS REALLY BASED ON THAT

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:01.350
AGENCY LEVEL SO I THINK GERMAN

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.285
WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE-

01:12:03.352 --> 01:12:05.187
YEAH. THE ONE POINT I WOULD ADD

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.455
TO IS IT MY UNDERSTANDING IS

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:08.390
THE FUNDING IS. DERIVED BASED

01:12:08.457 --> 01:12:10.025
ON POPULATIONS AND A FORMULA

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.193
DRIVE FROM THE FEDERAL

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.128
GOVERNMENT DOWN TO THE STATE

01:12:13.195 --> 01:12:14.963
AND- DOWN TO OUR LOCAL AGENCIES.

01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:16.265
I WOULD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:12:16.331 --> 01:12:17.900
TO POINT OUT THAT AS FAR AS

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:19.535
MAXIMIZING THE WORD MAXIMIZING

01:12:19.601 --> 01:12:21.170
THE FUNDING I WOULD SAY. THE

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:22.404
FLEXIBILITY OF C. S. B. G.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:24.606
ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE WHATEVER

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:25.140
AMOUNT THE FUNDING WE GET

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.276
LOCALLY. WE'RE ABLE TO LEVERAGE

01:12:27.342 --> 01:12:29.478
IT SO WE SPREAD OUR MONEY. IN

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:31.613
KERN COUNTY OUT AMONGST MANY

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.549
PROGRAMS- WHETHER IT BE MY GIRL

01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:36.719
TURNER PAYMENT PROGRAM. OR VITA

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:39.955
PROGRAM- DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TO

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:41.657
USE CENTERS ARE FOOD BANKS WE

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:43.058
SPREAD THAT OUT LEVERAGE

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:43.926
AGAINST MANY OTHER STATE AND

01:12:43.992 --> 01:12:45.594
FEDERAL PROGRAMS. AND BUILD THE

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:46.562
PROGRAMS THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.464
OPERATE. SO WE GET MAXIMUM
