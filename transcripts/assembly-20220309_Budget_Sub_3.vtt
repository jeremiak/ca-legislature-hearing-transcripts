ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:10.328
TRANSPORTATION DECARBONIZATION.

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:11.830
TODAY I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:13.431
ABOUT THREE OTHER AREAS

00:27:13.498 --> 00:27:14.966
ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:16.801
GENERATION CARP DECARBONISATION.

00:27:16.868 --> 00:27:19.337
BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AND

00:27:19.404 --> 00:27:20.939
INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION.

00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:22.040
LET'S START WITH ELECTRICITY

00:27:22.107 --> 00:27:24.442
SYSTEM THE CARD THERE ARE FOUR

00:27:24.509 --> 00:27:26.711
TOPICS ALL PRESENT FIRST IS

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:28.346
LONGER RATIONS STORAGE WHERE

00:27:28.413 --> 00:27:29.647
WE'RE SEEKING TRAINER EIGHTY

00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:31.449
MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS

00:27:31.516 --> 00:27:34.619
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR CLEAN

00:27:34.686 --> 00:27:36.087
ENERGY FUTURE. UNDER HIS SWORD

00:27:36.154 --> 00:27:38.289
WILL ENABLE US TO. KEEP THE

00:27:38.356 --> 00:27:39.858
LIGHTS ON WHEN THE GRID GOES

00:27:39.924 --> 00:27:41.526
DOWN FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:43.595
OR WHEN PRINTABLES ARE ACTIVE

00:27:43.661 --> 00:27:44.362
WHEN THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING THE

00:27:44.429 --> 00:27:46.498
SUN IS SHINING. IN THEIR THREE

00:27:46.564 --> 00:27:47.932
REAL WELL PRIMARY DRIVERS WE'VE

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.968
GOT WHEN WE WHEN WE LOOK AT LONG

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.603
DURATION STORAGE THE FIRST IS

00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:53.805
DIVERSIFICATION AS EVERYBODY

00:27:53.872 --> 00:27:56.408
KNOWS WE'VE ALL GOT LITHIUM ION-

00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:58.276
BATTERIES IN OUR POCKETS AND IN

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:00.478
OUR HOMES IN OUR CARS AND THEY

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:02.313
WORK EXTREMELY WELL. THEY'RE NOT

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:04.015
PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED HOWEVER

00:28:04.082 --> 00:28:05.750
LONG DURATION STORAGE YOU CAN

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:07.218
USE THEM BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:28:07.285 --> 00:28:08.653
THEY'RE NOT THE BEST TECHNOLOGY

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.622
SO WE WANT TO DO IS LOOK AT

00:28:10.688 --> 00:28:11.923
OTHER CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES LIKE

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.591
ZINC. IRON FLOW BATTERIES WE

00:28:13.658 --> 00:28:14.526
WANT TO LOOK AT MECHANICAL

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:16.928
STORAGE LIKE COMPRESSED AIR AND

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.430
FLY WHEELS AND WE WANT TO LOOK

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:20.331
AT THERMAL TECHNOLOGIES. SECOND

00:28:20.398 --> 00:28:23.134
BIG PLANK FOR TO SUPPORT THIS

00:28:23.201 --> 00:28:25.236
LAUNDRY STORAGE IS HELPING

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:26.404
COMMUNITIES GET THROUGH GREAT

00:28:26.471 --> 00:28:28.139
OPTIONS AS WE'VE SEEN THE SUMMER

00:28:28.206 --> 00:28:29.374
HEAT STORMS THAT HAVE CREATED

00:28:29.441 --> 00:28:31.176
THE P. S. P. S. ADVANCED. AND

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:33.211
ARE IN THE FIRES RESULTED IN

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.280
OUTAGES MANY OF WHICH HAVE THE

00:28:35.346 --> 00:28:36.448
SPEAK SEATED FOR HOURS AND

00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:37.782
THAT'S KIND OF THE INDUSTRY

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.050
STANDARD FOR WERE LET HIM WORKS

00:28:39.117 --> 00:28:41.252
THE BEST FOR OUR RANGE SO WE

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:43.154
WANT TO LOOK AT EIGHT HOURS AND

00:28:43.221 --> 00:28:44.456
BEYOND AND IT EIGHT HOURS. THE

00:28:44.522 --> 00:28:46.558
VAST MAJORITY OF THE PS PS AND

00:28:46.624 --> 00:28:47.725
THAT'S WHAT THE MITIGATED BY

00:28:47.792 --> 00:28:50.061
HAVING THAT STORAGE IN PLACE AND

00:28:50.128 --> 00:28:51.996
FINALLY. A GREAT SUPPORT AS THEY

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:53.465
SB ONE HUNDRED NOTED WE'RE GONNA

00:28:53.531 --> 00:28:55.834
NEED LOTS OF LOTS OF STORAGE AND

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:57.702
INSANITY BE PLACED ON VARIOUS

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.804
PLACES THROUGHOUT THE GRID AND

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.773
SO THE INVESTMENT WE'RE

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.308
PROPOSING WOULD HELP US DEVELOP

00:29:03.374 --> 00:29:04.742
THESE TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE

00:29:04.809 --> 00:29:06.845
CAN PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. RBP

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.246
ARE BASICALLY SPELLS OUT IN

00:29:08.313 --> 00:29:09.581
DETAIL AND OBVIOUSLY I'M A

00:29:09.647 --> 00:29:11.149
POLICE TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:12.450
I'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE SO

00:29:12.517 --> 00:29:14.752
WE CAN. WE CAN MOVE THROUGH

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:16.554
THESE UP QUICKLY TO THE NEXT ONE

00:29:16.621 --> 00:29:17.222
IS GREEN HYDROGEN HUNDRED

00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:18.823
BILLION DOLLARS WERE SEEKING FOR

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:20.191
GREEN HYDROGEN. AS I THINK YOU

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:22.594
ALL KNOW AND I KNOW YOU HAD A

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:24.429
FUEL CELL VEHICLE AT ONE POINT-

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:27.065
THE HYGIENIST ALREADY AVAILABLE

00:29:27.132 --> 00:29:28.533
IN PLAYING A ROLE IN THE

00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.135
TRANSPORTATION SPACE IT'S ALSO A

00:29:30.201 --> 00:29:31.636
POTENTIAL PLAYER AND HARD TO

00:29:31.703 --> 00:29:32.804
ELECTRIFY SECTORS WERE HIGH

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:41.713
HEATS. ARE IMPORTANT IN IN

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:42.413
VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PROF. AND

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.348
THAT'S FINE GRAYSON. IT CAN COPY

00:29:43.414 --> 00:29:45.483
OR WITH. FOSSIL GAS. AND CAN BE

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:47.852
USED AS A- STORE. AND THEN AND

00:29:47.919 --> 00:29:48.453
THEN BURN OR BRUNCH FEEL SO.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:50.722
WHEN NEEDED. HOWEVER IT'S A NEW

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:51.723
TO THE SPACE- HYGIENE AND- WE

00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:53.525
GOT A LOT TO LEARN. OUR STRATEGY

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:54.826
IS A NUMBER STRESS BECAUSE IN

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.794
ORDER TO USE HIGH JUNIOR TO

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:57.896
PRODUCE IT. UNLIKE WHEN WHERE

00:29:57.962 --> 00:29:59.898
YOU CAN JUST PUT UP A IN A BILL

00:29:59.964 --> 00:30:01.633
SOMETHING PUT IT AND GET FREE A

00:30:01.699 --> 00:30:02.734
FREE RESOURCE. FOR SOLAR WERE

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.335
CAN USE THE IN YOUR- YOU IS

00:30:04.402 --> 00:30:06.337
FREE- YOU'VE GOT PRODUCE

00:30:06.404 --> 00:30:07.272
HYDROGEN AND WE- IT THE NO

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:08.239
REGRETS STRATEGY BECAUSE WE'VE

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.474
GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRODUCE

00:30:09.541 --> 00:30:11.409
IT IN A GREEN WAY. OVER 95% OF

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.678
IT TODAY IS PRODUCED USING

00:30:13.745 --> 00:30:15.146
FOSSIL FUELS AND THIS FUNDING IS

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:16.648
GOING TO HELP. TURN THE TIDE ON

00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:18.750
THAT IT ALSO HELPED US ATTRACT

00:30:18.816 --> 00:30:19.951
FEDERAL FUNDS OF THE FEDERAL

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:22.387
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW AS

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:24.055
A LOT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:25.623
THIRD AND IT IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.724
MATCHING REQUIREMENTS SO WE

00:30:26.791 --> 00:30:28.660
THINK WE WERE. WELL POISED TO

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.695
PARTICIPATE IN THAT THIRD IS

00:30:30.762 --> 00:30:33.431
AWFUL WHEN. WE'RE SEEKING FORTY

00:30:33.498 --> 00:30:34.299
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:30:34.365 --> 00:30:35.633
OFFSHORE WIND THIS IS AN

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.502
ENORMOUS UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY

00:30:37.569 --> 00:30:39.871
FOR CALIFORNIA. WHEN COMPLIMENTS

00:30:39.938 --> 00:30:45.109
SOLAR NICELY BECAUSE. IT OFTEN

00:30:45.176 --> 00:30:46.477
BLOWS WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN. IN

00:30:46.544 --> 00:30:48.479
OUR S. ONE HUNDRED REPORT- I DO

00:30:48.546 --> 00:30:49.814
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AND IT

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.216
LOOKED AT IF WE HAVE TEN

00:30:51.282 --> 00:30:52.951
GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND THE

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:53.551
TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHAT WOULD

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.253
THAT DO AND THE ANSWERS THAT

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.487
WOULD SAVE A BILLION DOLLARS AS

00:30:56.554 --> 00:30:58.423
AGAINST OTHER PORTFOLIOS OF

00:30:58.489 --> 00:31:01.092
REACH OF RESOURCES. SO THIS IS A

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:02.493
THIS HOLDS A LOT OF PROMISE

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.661
WOULD BE LOOKING AT SPENDING

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:05.563
SOME OF THE FUNDS IN EARLY STAGE

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.931
ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND

00:31:06.998 --> 00:31:07.498
REVIEWS AND SOME OF IT AND

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:09.934
INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PORTS WHERE

00:31:10.001 --> 00:31:11.169
FATHER MOST SUITABLE TO OFFER

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:13.438
WENT FORTH AND FINALLY IN THIS

00:31:13.504 --> 00:31:14.439
FIRST ELECTRICITY-

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:17.575
DECARBONISATION SECTOR IS ENERGY

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.544
MODELING THIS IS A MODEST

00:31:19.611 --> 00:31:21.045
REQUEST OF SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS

00:31:21.112 --> 00:31:22.947
BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WE

00:31:23.014 --> 00:31:24.782
IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE SB ONE

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:25.583
HUNDRED REPORT WE RELIED VERY

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.151
HEAVILY ON MODELING TO LOOK AT

00:31:27.218 --> 00:31:28.686
ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS

00:31:28.753 --> 00:31:30.855
THAT. WE COULD BE FACED WITH IN

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:31.422
TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND WE'RE

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:32.624
GOING TO INVEST BILLIONS OF

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.958
DOLLARS IN THIS IT'S CRITICAL

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.326
THAT WE MAKE WISE DECISIONS AND

00:31:35.393 --> 00:31:38.029
IN MODELING IS REALLY A TOOL

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:39.163
THAT WILL HELP US. SECOND OF ALL

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.898
THAT WAS ALL THE LITERACY

00:31:40.965 --> 00:31:43.001
DECARBONISATION ITEMS SECOND IS

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:48.006
BUILDING. THE CAR WE JUST UP ONE

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.674
ITEM. THEY WANT WE'RE SEEKING

00:31:49.741 --> 00:31:50.575
HUNDRED TWENTY TWO NO DOLLARS

00:31:50.642 --> 00:31:52.844
FOR EQUITABLE BUILDING TO. IT

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.512
AGAIN AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'VE GOT

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.713
REALLY WELL IN CALIFORNIA WITH

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.382
OUR NEW BUILDINGS WE'VE GOT SOME

00:31:57.448 --> 00:32:00.018
OF THE BEST MOST EFFICIENT MOST-

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:01.252
BUT LEAST CARBON PRODUCING

00:32:01.319 --> 00:32:03.321
BUILDINGS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD-

00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:04.255
IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY

00:32:04.322 --> 00:32:05.623
DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.091
DOING THAT HOWEVER OUR EXISTING

00:32:07.158 --> 00:32:09.127
BUILDING STOCK HALF OF WHICH WAS

00:32:09.193 --> 00:32:10.361
BUILT BEFORE THE ENERGY

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:11.763
COMMISSION EXISTED IN BEFORE ANY

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:13.364
STANDARDS WERE IN PLACE AND

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:14.966
ANOTHER BIG CHUNK OF IT. IN THE

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:16.267
EARLY DAYS WHEN THE STANDARDS

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:18.770
WERE NOT LIKE THEY ARE TODAY-

00:32:18.836 --> 00:32:20.204
THAT'S A MUCH HARDER SECTOR TO

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.673
TACKLE FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:32:21.739 --> 00:32:24.042
DIFFERENT REASONS I CAN GO INTO

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.677
ABOUT I'LL SKIP OVER THAT- SO

00:32:25.743 --> 00:32:26.844
WE'RE PROPOSING TWO THIRDS OF

00:32:26.911 --> 00:32:29.113
THAT. FUNDING GO TO DIRECT

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.982
INSTALLS TO TARGETED TOWARDS

00:32:31.049 --> 00:32:32.350
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:34.218
LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FOLKS

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.988
AND THE BALLOTS ONE THIRD OR SO

00:32:37.055 --> 00:32:38.990
FOR A REBATE PROGRAM AVAILABLE

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:41.025
TO EVERYONE. WE EXPECT THAT BOTH

00:32:41.092 --> 00:32:42.360
OF THESE EFFORTS WILL JUMP START

00:32:42.427 --> 00:32:45.163
BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION IN

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:46.497
CALIFORNIA. FINAL ARE FINE OKAY

00:32:46.564 --> 00:32:48.599
. IN D. KARBALA GOT TO. THE

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:51.002
FIRST IS WHAT WE AFTER THE FOOD

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:52.837
PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM.

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:54.772
AND THE SECONDS MORE BROAD

00:32:54.839 --> 00:32:57.275
INDUSTRIAL DE CAR SO ON. AN

00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:58.876
ACTIVE THIS WAS ORIGINALLY

00:32:58.943 --> 00:33:00.044
FUNDED WITH CLIMATE INVESTMENT

00:33:00.111 --> 00:33:01.245
FUNDING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE

00:33:01.312 --> 00:33:03.147
RECEIVED A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR

00:33:03.214 --> 00:33:03.848
MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED ALL

00:33:03.915 --> 00:33:06.117
THAT. WE HAD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.151
MILLION DOLLARS OF APPLICATIONS

00:33:07.218 --> 00:33:09.520
MANY IF NOT MOST OF WHICH- THE

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:10.722
DIDN'T GET FUNDED WERE

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:12.457
MERITORIOUS PROJECTS BUT WE

00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:13.691
SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:14.792
FUND THEM. SOME OF THESE

00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.794
PROJECTS ARE SHOWING 7280%

00:33:16.861 --> 00:33:19.797
SAVINGS ON. ENERGY CONSUMPTION.

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:22.834
AND THE- THE CARB SCORING A

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:24.869
VARIOUS PROJECTS PLACED. THE F.

00:33:24.936 --> 00:33:28.239
TYPE INVESTMENTS ON A- ON A

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:31.676
DOLLAR PER. METRIC TON. OF CO

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.444
TWO EQUIVALENT. VERY HIGH IT'S

00:33:33.511 --> 00:33:34.479
GOING VERY WELL IN THE

00:33:34.545 --> 00:33:35.713
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY THIRTY

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.415
FIVE DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. AND

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:39.150
WE ESTIMATE THAT THE INVESTMENTS

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:40.852
IN THAT PROGRAM WILL SAVE

00:33:40.918 --> 00:33:42.653
ANOTHER FIFTY ONE MILLION. PER

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:44.155
YEAR ONCE EVERYTHING'S FULLY

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:46.424
BUILT OUT. SO THIS IS NOT A VERY

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:47.325
POPULAR PROGRAM WE JUST WANT TO

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.694
EXPAND THAT- AND FINALLY I WANT

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.596
TO TALK ABOUT- INDUSTRIAL THE

00:33:51.662 --> 00:33:54.031
KERBAL SEEKING. TWO HUNDRED TEN

00:33:54.098 --> 00:33:55.066
MILLION DOLLARS AND ESSENTIALLY

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:57.969
WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS. TAKE

00:33:58.035 --> 00:33:58.870
WHAT WE LEARNED FROM FF WHICH IS

00:33:58.936 --> 00:34:00.872
VERY LABOR INTENSIVE WE WORK

00:34:00.938 --> 00:34:02.774
VERY CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY EARLY

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.975
ON THERE WAS DEEP SKEPTICISM

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:06.010
ABOUT. THE ABILITY FOR THE FUNDS

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:07.512
TO DO ANY GOOD IN IN THE

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.680
INDUSTRY. AND I THINK IF YOU ASK

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:10.648
ANYONE ON THE INDUSTRY THAT SAID

00:34:10.715 --> 00:34:12.216
THIS THIS WORKED OUT REALLY WELL

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:14.385
SO WE WANT TO TRY TO REPLICATE

00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.753
THAT. AND THE MORE BROAD

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.321
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR WHERE WE HAVE

00:34:17.388 --> 00:34:17.855
FORTY THOUSAND INDUSTRIAL

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:19.490
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA POINT

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.459
OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. THE

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:22.393
DUCHESS SECTORS OF BOTH IS

00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.595
RESPONSIBLE FOR. OVER A THIRD OF

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.097
THE STATE'S FOSSEL GAS USING

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:28.599
ABOUT 20% OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS.

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.435
SO WHAT WE'D BE LOOKING AT-

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:32.236
SOMETHING MEMBERS IN THIS IN

00:34:32.303 --> 00:34:39.444
THIS. CATEGORY IS. THERE IS LIKE

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.648
SOME. DEMICHELIS GLASS GHG.

00:34:43.714 --> 00:34:45.216
WHERE THERE'S REAL AND REAL READ

00:34:45.283 --> 00:34:47.285
TO THE SORT OF THE BASS WE THINK

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:48.453
WE CAN LEARN LOT FROM THE FOOD

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:50.354
PRODUCER PROBE. AND WE WILL DO

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:51.456
WORKSHOPS WITH ALL PRO TO LEARN

00:34:51.522 --> 00:34:53.224
FROM FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE

00:34:53.291 --> 00:34:55.293
INDUSTRY FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDER

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:56.761
ABOUT HOW BEST TO SHAPE THEM BUT

00:34:56.828 --> 00:34:58.162
UP THAT'S PLAN AND I THINK VERY

00:34:58.229 --> 00:34:59.964
MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:35:00.031 --> 00:35:00.531

I'M GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN. FIRST

00:36:11.969 --> 00:36:12.703
WE THINK THE PACKAGE BETTER

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.273
TARGETS A REASONABLE STEP BACK.

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.474
IF THE GOAL OF PROMOTING A LONG

00:36:16.541 --> 00:36:20.278
TERM CARP. OKAY THE FUNDING

00:36:20.344 --> 00:36:22.880
WOULD SUPPORT- KEY AREAS WORSE.

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.749
SECOND PROGRESS HELP LOWER COSTS

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:25.683
ACHIEVING TERM GAS REDUCTION

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:27.585
GOALS. AND SOME OF THE OTHER

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:28.886
PIECES UPON FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:36:28.953 --> 00:36:31.389
EQUITABLE BUILDING. PROGRAM

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.523
TARGETS ONE OF THE LARGEST

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:35.059
SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:36:35.126 --> 00:36:36.427
EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. THE

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.529
SECOND- OVERARCHING AS WE THINK

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.398
ALLOCATING STATE GENERAL FUND

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.867
RATHER THAN- UTILITY ELECTRIC

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:44.101
RATEPAYER FUNDS REALLY HAS

00:36:44.168 --> 00:36:47.204
MERIT- FOR A LOT OF THESE

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:48.372
PROGRAMS. HERE THE STATE'S CLEAN

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:49.574
ENERGY PROGRAMS HISTORICALLY

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.108
HAVE BEEN PAID FOR THROUGH

00:36:51.175 --> 00:36:52.843
ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS THROUGH

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.745
HIGHER ELECTRICITY RATES. EVEN

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.280
THOUGH SOME OF THE PRIMARY GOALS

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:57.615
OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS

00:36:57.682 --> 00:36:58.516
REALLY ARE GOING TO REDUCE

00:36:58.583 --> 00:36:59.450
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.751
SMOKEBENEFITS ACCRUE TO THE

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:02.453
BROADER PUBLIC AND SO WE THINK

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:03.721
THERE'S A- STRONG RATIONALE FOR

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:05.122
USING STATE GENERAL FUND FOR

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:06.324
THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.693
PROVIDE. BROAD SOCIETAL

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.861
BENEFITS. ALSO ACROSS RIDLEY

00:37:10.928 --> 00:37:12.363
INTERVIEW PROGRAMS ARE ONE

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.465
FACTOR ONE OF MANY FACTORS BUT

00:37:14.532 --> 00:37:16.701
ONE FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES TO.

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:18.536
CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY HIGH-

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:21.172
RETAIL ELECTRICITY RATES AND

00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:22.640
SOME OF THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:23.574
OF THOSE HIGHER ELECTRICITY

00:37:23.641 --> 00:37:25.042
RATES ARE ONE THEY CAN

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.611
DISCOURAGE ELECTRIFICATION SO

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:28.813
THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC- IN SOME

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.014
OF THE STATE'S DECARBONIZATION

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.716
EFFORTS. ALSO ELECTRICITY RATES

00:37:31.782 --> 00:37:33.551
ARE RELATIVELY REGRESSIVE

00:37:33.618 --> 00:37:34.819
APPROACH TO RAISING REVENUE AND

00:37:34.885 --> 00:37:36.320
SO WE DO KIND OF THINK THE

00:37:36.387 --> 00:37:37.922
ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:42.126
USING GENERAL FUND IN THIS AREA

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.961
HAS A- LOT OF MERIT. THIRD BIG

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.497
PICTURE COMMENT IS- REALLY WANT

00:37:46.564 --> 00:37:48.866
TO BUY WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL WITH

00:37:48.933 --> 00:37:49.700
THE LETTER SO WILL HAVE BALANCE

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.502
KIND OF LONG TERM DEBT. THE

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:52.403
COULD BE ACHIEVED A LOT OF THE

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:54.171
PROGRAM AGAINST SOME OTHER NEAR

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:56.574
TERM PRIORITIES THAT MIGHT. MY

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:58.376
GIVE ME. SO MUCH THE PROPOSED

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:00.845
FUNDING IS REALLY FOCUSED ON

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:01.779
ACTIVITIES. TO AGAIN TO ME THESE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:05.282
LONG TERM THE CARD. GOALS AND-

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:06.684
THE PROGRAM THE G. WERE BETTER.

00:38:06.751 --> 00:38:07.718
ARE LIKELY TO BE RELATIVELY

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:09.787
MODEST OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:11.222
AND SO. THE LEGISLATURE

00:38:11.288 --> 00:38:12.456
AUTOMOTIVE TOPIC BALANCE SOME OF

00:38:12.523 --> 00:38:13.624
THE LONGER TERM BENEFITS THAT

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.226
MIGHT BE TREATED WITH OTHER NEAR

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:17.928
ME. AND MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.597
IT MIGHT HAVE SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:38:19.664 --> 00:38:22.466
OTHER PROGRAMS AIMED AT MEETING-

00:38:22.533 --> 00:38:23.868
YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY- MEDIUM

THAT. ARE TARGETED SIMILAR THING

00:39:07.344 --> 00:39:09.146
INCLUDING CLEAN HYDROGEN HUBS

PROJECTS. INDUSTRIAL MISSION

00:39:12.616 --> 00:39:14.752
DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS LONGER

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.654
ASIAN ENERGY STORAGE. BUT IN

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:18.389
MANY CASES THE FOR DETAILED

00:39:18.456 --> 00:39:19.690
FEDERAL GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW THE

00:39:19.757 --> 00:39:21.826
FUNDING CAN BE USED AND HOW IT

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.427
WILL BE ALLOCATED ISN'T YET

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.328
AVAILABLE. BUT THE RESULTS NOT

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.430
CLEAR HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.598
STRATEGICALLY TARGETS FUNDING IN

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:29.333
A WAY THAT BEST COMPLIMENTS ON

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.035
THE FEDERAL FUNDING. SO FOR

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.436
EXAMPLE FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:39:32.503 --> 00:39:34.238
USE STATE FUNDING TO LEVERAGE

00:39:34.305 --> 00:39:40.678
FEDERAL FUNDS IN A WAY. THAT

00:39:40.745 --> 00:39:41.812
HELPS FURTHER STAPLES- PROGRAMS

00:39:41.879 --> 00:39:43.714
SUCH AS- FUNDING TO PREVENT. AND

00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:46.317
ENHANCED THE WORK STATE. UP AT

00:39:46.383 --> 00:39:48.719
THE IT DOESN'T CANNELLA KATE-

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.821
FUND FOR THAT STATE NOT MOST

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.690
PROGRAMS. GOT A QUESTION OR IS

00:39:52.757 --> 00:39:54.425
THIS ARE THERE TO GET AND BETTER

00:39:54.492 --> 00:39:56.694
FUNDING THE STATE FUNDING. THE

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:57.661
HELPFULNESS OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:59.263
MIGHT WANNA IN THE- TO DEVELOP A

00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:00.498
STRATEGY FOR YOU STATE FUNDS AND

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.699
THAT THAT BEST COMPLEMENTS

00:40:01.766 --> 00:40:07.304
FEDERAL. RESTRUCTURE PACKAGE. SO

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:11.342
I'M NOT. TWO- AT THE SPECIFIC

00:40:11.408 --> 00:40:13.878
TIME ON A FEW OF SPECIFIC RECALL

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.012
ARE THROUGH TO THREE ERRORS

00:40:15.079 --> 00:40:16.847
QUICKLY OF I CAN ONE OF THE ACT

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:17.381
BILL THE CAR PROGRAM- WE

00:40:17.448 --> 00:40:18.282
RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE DIRECT

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.849
MINISTRY COOPER ADDITIONAL

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.418
DETAILS HOW THE FOR BOTH

00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:22.386
PROGRAMS AFFECT AND KIND OF THE

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.255
OVERALL STATEWIDE BUILDING

00:40:24.321 --> 00:40:25.222
DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY- FOR

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:27.625
EXAMPLE WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THESE

00:40:27.691 --> 00:40:28.592
PROGRAMS RELATIVE TO OTHER

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:30.094
POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES SUCH AS

00:40:30.161 --> 00:40:31.362
CHANGES IN ELECTRICITY RATE

00:40:31.428 --> 00:40:32.696
STRUCTURES THAT LOWER

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:33.697
ELECTRICITY RATES AND COULD

00:40:33.764 --> 00:40:35.166
ENCOURAGE A BUILDING

00:40:35.232 --> 00:40:36.834
ELECTRIFICATION. WHAT IMPACT

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:38.769
ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS STOP ON

00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:40.971
REMAINING NATURAL GAS COSTS FOR

00:40:41.038 --> 00:40:42.373
CUSTOMERS IN PAIN FOR A KIND OF

00:40:42.439 --> 00:40:44.074
SOME OF THOSE FIXED

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:45.743
INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND THEN-

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.511
ANOTHER FINAL EXAMPLE WHY IS THE

00:40:47.578 --> 00:40:48.646
INTERNET CONNECTION THE MOST

00:40:48.712 --> 00:40:50.381
APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO ADMINISTER

00:40:50.447 --> 00:40:52.283
THIS NEW DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAM

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.819
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED- AS YOU

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.453
LIKELY KNOW THAT FOR MANY

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.221
COMMUNITY SERVICES AND

00:40:57.288 --> 00:40:58.622
DEVELOPMENT ALREADY OPERATES A

00:40:58.689 --> 00:41:00.124
COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WEATHER

00:41:00.191 --> 00:41:01.759
EDUCATION PROGRAMS TARGETED AT

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.060
LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FOR

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:03.828
THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:06.730
EXPLORE AND WIND UP PROPOSAL IS

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:07.798
TO HAVE A NEW PROGRAM AT THE

00:41:07.865 --> 00:41:08.666
ENERGY COMMISSION RATHER THAN

00:41:08.732 --> 00:41:10.201
RELYING ON THE EXISTING

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.837
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IF AFTER

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.405
KIND OF THESE RESPONSES IT'S

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:15.773
STILL UNCLEAR WHY THE PROPOSED

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.474
APPROACH BY THE ADMINISTRATION

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.143
IS MOST COST EFFECTIVE OR

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:20.878
EQUITABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD

00:41:20.945 --> 00:41:22.379
SCALE BACK THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING

00:41:22.446 --> 00:41:24.048
ARE FOCUSED ON WAYS THAT THAT

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:32.523
HELPED- DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND.

00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:33.324
DEVELOP A LONG TERM STRATEGY.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.992
THE SECOND IT'S BECAUSE RECALL-

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:39.230
IS THE- PUMPS. PROJECT WHICH- I

00:41:39.296 --> 00:41:40.664
DON'T BELIEVE DIRECTOR TOUCHED

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:43.033
ON BUT IS TWO HUNDRED FORTY

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.002
MILLION OF TO THE FOR A- TO KIND

00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:47.905
OF THAT- PUMPS FACILITY OR A

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.641
BILL- IF THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.142
MAYOR OF THE WEIGHT INTEGRATE

00:41:52.209 --> 00:41:54.578
RENEWABLE AND UNDER THE ON POWER

00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:55.880
MAKE CERTAIN AT THE END OF HOW

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:58.916
PROVIDED A MORTGAGE HOUSES OF

00:41:58.983 --> 00:42:01.085
KIND OF THE COST AFFECT OF THE-

00:42:01.151 --> 00:42:01.785
HER DAUGHTER. SO WE RECKON

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:02.887
ALLEGED DIRECT MINISTRY TO

00:42:02.953 --> 00:42:06.924
PROVIDE- THAT NOW SENT OF COST

00:42:06.991 --> 00:42:09.360
OF FOR TO OTHER OPTIONS. STATE

00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:11.428
ON THE PULSE OR THE LEGISLATURE

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:13.397
PROVIDES GENERAL FUND FOR THIS

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:15.833
PROJECT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT IT

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:16.901
ADOPTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

00:42:16.967 --> 00:42:18.636
REQUIRING. OR TO ESTIMATE THE

NET ANNUAL REVENUE GENERATED

00:42:20.371 --> 00:42:22.139
FROM THE PUMP STORAGE ONCE IT'S

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.407
OPERATIONAL ENTRANCE FOR THAT

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:25.542
AMOUNT THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S

00:42:25.609 --> 00:42:27.511
THE ARGUE THAT STATE TAX

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:28.545
TAXPAYERS ARE PROVIDING THE

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:30.614
FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT TO BE

00:42:30.681 --> 00:42:31.515
REASONABLE FOR THE STATE

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:37.922
TAXPAYERS AND TO KIND OF.

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:38.722
RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.291
FROM THE PROJECT. AND THEN THEY

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:43.727
- FINAL PIECES I'D THERE'S- I

00:42:43.794 --> 00:42:44.395
DON'T THINK ANY MINUTE WITH

00:42:44.461 --> 00:42:46.397
ENDED UP ARE THERE'S A THE

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:47.631
PROPOSAL INTERVIEW. EFFORTS AT

00:42:47.698 --> 00:42:50.434
THE W. R. IT INCLUDES THREE NINE

00:42:50.501 --> 00:42:51.335
DOLLARS GENERAL FUND PRETTY TO

RENEWABLE. ENERGY AND THIS IS-

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:41.412
BUT WHEN ENERGY THAT- K. OF THE

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:43.580
POWER CITY THIS OF SAN FRANCISCO

00:44:43.647 --> 00:44:46.150
JUST TO GIVE A- SENSE OF SCALE-

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:48.685
SO WHAT PROPOSAL WOULD DO IT-

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:51.655
YOU- THE- SO. ENERGY THAT'S

00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.757
AVAILABLE DURING THE DAY AND

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:56.460
ALLOW US TO PUMP WATER BACK INTO

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.195
LAKE OROVILLE AND THEN RELEASE

00:44:58.262 --> 00:45:00.230
THAT WATER IN THE LATE EVENING

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:03.100
AND- OR LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:04.935
EVENING HOURS WHEN ENERGY IS

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:06.770
MOST NEEDED AND CRITICAL FOR THE

THE FASTEST GROWING GREENHOUSE

00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.039
GASES IN CALIFORNIA AND GLOBAL.

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:17.508
HSCS ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:19.076
POLLUTANTS WITH HIGH GLOBAL

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:21.545
WARMING POTENTIAL THOUSAND TIMES

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.580
THAT OF CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:24.915
HAVEN'T FORTUNATE ADVERSE

00:46:24.982 --> 00:46:27.918
CLIMATE IMPACT IN THE NEAR TERM

00:46:27.985 --> 00:46:28.685
. ONE OF THE LARGEST USES OF

00:46:28.752 --> 00:46:30.521
AGENCIES IN REFRIGERATION AND

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:32.656
AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT. AND

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:33.924
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD

00:46:33.991 --> 00:46:36.226
RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THE NEED TO

00:46:36.293 --> 00:46:38.061
REGULATE THESE PROBLEMS AND MANY

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.963
OTHER STATES OF ALL OF OUR LEAD

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:42.633

ADDRESS HSCS UNDER CARBON

00:46:49.106 --> 00:46:50.874
NEUTRALITY. SO THIS PROPOSAL

00:46:50.941 --> 00:46:52.609
THIS IS ASKING FOR FORTY MILLION

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.811
DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO BUILD THE

00:46:54.878 --> 00:46:56.413
ONE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED BY

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.982
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWENTY

00:46:59.049 --> 00:47:00.651
NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET.

00:47:00.717 --> 00:47:01.985
THE FIRST OF AUGUST ON

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:02.619
COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.121
COMMONLY USED IN SUPERMARKETS

00:47:04.188 --> 00:47:06.390
AND GROCERY STORES. ULTRALOW

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.858
GLOBAL WARMING TECHNOLOGIES

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:10.227
EXIST TODAY- BARBARA HIGHER

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:12.029
INCREMENTAL COST AND LACK OF

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.330
FAMILIARITY WITH THESE

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:15.732
TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE PRIMARY

00:47:15.799 --> 00:47:17.467
BARRIERS TO THEIR ADOPTION. THIS

00:47:17.534 --> 00:47:18.735
IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:19.803
EXISTING STORES BECAUSE IT IS

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.505
VERY EXPENSIVE AND CHALLENGING

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:23.207
TO TRANSITION TO ULTRA LOW

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:25.142
GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL SYSTEM

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.511
DUE TO INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:29.346
THE WHOLE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

00:47:29.413 --> 00:47:30.647
THE ABSENCE OF INCENTIVE FUNDS

00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:32.749
EXISTING STORES ARE LIKELY TO

00:47:32.816 --> 00:47:35.152
EITHER CONTINUE TO- USE MAKING

00:47:35.219 --> 00:47:36.753
SYSTEMS. WHAT DO A REFRIGERANT

00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.589
RETROFIT TO A MID RANGE GLOBAL

00:47:38.655 --> 00:47:40.424
WARMING POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.627
RATHER STALLING. A NEW SYSTEM.

00:47:43.694 --> 00:47:45.596
SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE

00:47:45.662 --> 00:47:46.663
CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORP

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:03.880
AND HAPPY WILL WANT TO STORES

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:05.716
LOW IN LOW INCOME. AND

00:48:05.782 --> 00:48:07.985
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

00:48:08.051 --> 00:48:09.086
HOWEVER THIS REPRESENTS LESS

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:10.687
THAN 1% OF ALL SUPERMARKETS IN

00:48:10.754 --> 00:48:12.723
CALIFORNIA AND FINANCIAL

00:48:12.789 --> 00:48:14.791
INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED TO HELP

00:48:14.858 --> 00:48:16.260
TRANSITION THOUSANDS OF EXISTING

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.161
HFC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. AND

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.730
WILL BE CRUCIAL IN HELPING

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:21.832
SMALLER STORES AND DISADVANTAGED

00:48:21.898 --> 00:48:24.167
COMMUNITIES. UPSETS APARTMENTS

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:25.335
WE WOULD CONSIDER INCENTIVES FOR

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.470
OTHER COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION

00:48:26.536 --> 00:48:28.672
CATEGORIES AS WELL AS THEIR

00:48:28.739 --> 00:48:31.375
CONDITION. SO THE PENDING ON THE

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.509
SELECTED THEN USES THE FUNDING

00:48:32.576 --> 00:48:34.077
COULD REPLACE EXISTING HIGH

. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS

00:48:41.385 --> 00:48:42.686
FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO HELP

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:44.388
THESE TECHNOLOGY TYPES REACH

00:48:44.454 --> 00:48:46.356
ECONOMIES OF SCALE. WHICH MAY

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.091
LEAD TO FURTHER MARKET ADOPTION

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:50.193
AND THEREFORE GREATER GREENHOUSE

AT THIS TIME. GOOD MORNING DAY

00:49:20.891 --> 00:49:22.492
MA'AM NOT DEPARTMENT UP AND IT'S

00:49:22.559 --> 00:49:24.194
NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.429
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:28.065
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO LET ME

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:31.401
OPEN UP THE QUESTION- BY-

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:33.170
REFERRING BACK TO OUR INITIAL.

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:36.206
UP A PRESENTATION FROM A-

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:38.375
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BALL AND-

00:49:38.442 --> 00:49:41.111
YOU'RE RIGHT SIR I DO- RETAIN AN

00:49:41.178 --> 00:49:44.214
INTEREST IN- UGH- HYDROGEN AND

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:48.051
PARTICULARLY AND- THE PRODUCTION

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:51.488
OF GREEN HYDROGEN- OF THE A

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:52.422
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:56.960
PROPOSED. HOW MUCH- IT IS RIGHT

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.763
HERE MARK FOR- ELECTROLYZER

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:02.165
SYSTEM. MOVING THAT TECHNOLOGY

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:06.036
FORWARD. SHE'S REALLY GOOD

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.305
QUESTION THE SHORT ANSWER IS THE

00:50:08.372 --> 00:50:09.806
VAST MAJORITY OF IT THAT'S WHERE

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.808
WE THINK AGAIN THE MOST CRITICAL

00:50:11.875 --> 00:50:13.510
PIECES IS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:16.446
PRODUCE HYDROGEN IS THAT HAVE TO

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:17.748
TYPICALLY STORE IT DELIVER IT

00:50:17.814 --> 00:50:19.783
AND THEN CONVERTED INTO ENERGY-

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:21.752
BACK AND ENERGY AND SO WE THINK

00:50:21.818 --> 00:50:23.353
THAT FIRST LEG AT THERE'S NOT

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:24.688
BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCEMENTS IN

00:50:24.755 --> 00:50:26.456
THIS AREA AND WE THINK WE CAN

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:28.625
ADVANCED THINGS QUITE A BIT. BY

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:30.193
BY MAKING INVESTMENTS THERE SO

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.395
SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF IT WOULD

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.430
ALSO BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE

00:50:33.497 --> 00:50:34.965
OTHER ASPECTS SOME OF THE

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:36.500
DISTRIBUTION SOME OF THE

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:38.168
STORAGE- WELL AS THEIR

00:50:38.235 --> 00:50:39.903
COMPLEMENTARY AND FINALLY I

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.505
WOULD JUST SAY WE WANT TO PUT

00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.273
REAL SPECIFICS TOGETHER AND

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.075
BUILD A SOLICITATION THAT WE

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.910
WOULD PUT OUT AFTER HEARING FROM

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:49.379
STAKEHOLDERS AND HEARING FROM

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:51.214
THE BEST MINDS ON HOW WE MIGHT

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.349
DO THIS THE BEST BUT THE FOCUS

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:55.318
WOULD CLEARLY BE AN ELECTROLYSIS

00:50:55.385 --> 00:50:57.154
SO- I'VE I'VE READ JUST ENOUGH

00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:59.356
ON ON THIS TOPIC TO MAKE MYSELF.

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:03.126
PROBABLY. REALLY DANGEROUS- BUT

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.429
IT IT DOES TO ME THAT THERE'S A

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:06.563
LOT OF INVESTMENT AND

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:07.330
ELECTROLYZER. TECHNOLOGY GOING

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.900
ON AROUND THE WORLD MOST

00:51:09.966 --> 00:51:12.135
RECENTLY I WAS READING ABOUT-

00:51:12.202 --> 00:51:14.404
PROJECTED INVESTMENT. TO IN

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.807
AUSTRALIA- AND THE INVESTMENT

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:18.175
THEIR MUCH OF WHICH WAS COMING

00:51:18.241 --> 00:51:20.210
FROM THE- PRIVATE SECTOR WAS IN

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:23.013
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- CAN YOU

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:25.515
COMMENT ON SORT OF WHERE WE ARE.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:28.218
TECHNOLOGICALLY AS A STATE THE

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:30.487
COUNTRY VERSUS THE REST OF THE

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:33.290
WORLD AND TO- WHITE MIGHT BE

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.959
IMPORTANT FOR US TO- TAKE A

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:39.429
LEADERSHIP. ROLE IN MOVING THE

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:42.499
TECHNOLOGY FORWARD. CERTAINLY I

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.968
DON'T KNOW HOW WE STARE RELATIVE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.369
TO OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD IN

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:48.371
TERMS OF HOW TO DEVELOP WE ARE

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:49.706
BUT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.141
IS ON REMARKABLE USING USING

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.742
ELECTRICITY TO SPLIT HYDROGEN

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.945
OUT OF EITHER. METHANE CH FOR

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:57.714
WATER H. TWO O. CAN BE DONE THE

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.983
CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU DO IT COST

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.451
EFFECTIVELY HOW DO YOU DO IT

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:02.619
USING CHEAPER RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:52:02.686 --> 00:52:04.221
HOW DO U. FAKE HOW DO YOU CITED.

00:52:04.287 --> 00:52:05.622
IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE PRODUCING

00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:08.091
AT THEN AND NOT HAVING TO INCUR

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:09.726
LARGE COSTS TO MOVE IT TO FAR

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.460
FLUNG PLACES WHAT'S APPEALING

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.529
ABOUT IT IS IF YOU USE SOLAR IN

00:52:12.596 --> 00:52:15.432
PARTICULAR YOU COULD SET UP-

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.467
PROPERLY SITED SOLAR FARM.

00:52:17.534 --> 00:52:19.135
PRODUCE ELECTRICITY NECESSARY TO

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:22.739
SPLIT THE WATER AND- AND THEN

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.542
YOU HAVE RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT

00:52:25.609 --> 00:52:26.810
THAT THE HIGHER. I THINK THERE'S

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:29.179
THE THING WE'RE LOOKING AT IS

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:31.147
REALLY. RIGHT TO BRING COSTS

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:33.650
DOWN. AND TO DO THAT THAT OF

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:34.417
COURSE INVOLVES TECHNOLOGICAL

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.285
BREAKTHROUGHS BUT IT ALSO

00:52:35.352 --> 00:52:36.753
INVOLVES JUST BLOCKING TACKLING

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.488
OPERATIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT IN

00:52:38.555 --> 00:52:40.123
THE SOLAR INDUSTRY WHERE. THE

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:42.359
TECHNOLOGY WAS ONE PIECE OF WHAT

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:44.194
DROVE THE COSTS DOWN BUT A LOT

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.030
OF IT HAD TO DO IT HOW DO YOU

00:52:47.097 --> 00:52:47.664
PUT RACKING ON THAT'S THE LEAST

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.466
EXPENSIVE HOW DO YOU GET- LABOR

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:50.667
TO BOB. WORK NICELY WITH THE

00:52:50.734 --> 00:52:52.369
OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING

00:52:52.435 --> 00:52:53.537
INDUSTRY IS AS OF STRUCTURE IS

00:52:53.603 --> 00:52:57.474
BEING BUILT. TO WHERE WE WANT TO

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:58.475
EXPLORE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:00.744
THINGS. THANK YOU- A WITH

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:06.550
RESPECT TO THE- A REQUEST FOR-

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:10.420
RESOURCES FOR- OFFSHORE WIND-

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:11.755
THE AMOUNT IS FORTY FIVE MILLION

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:19.863
DOLLARS AND- I THINK THE- UGH

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.233
UGH. A DATE THAT I SAW IN THE US

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.671
STAFF REPORT WAS- JUNE OF-

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:28.672
TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT WHICH UP

00:53:28.738 --> 00:53:31.174
A POINT TO THESE OF FUNDS WOULD

00:53:31.241 --> 00:53:35.612
BE UP OF FULLY SPENT WHERE ARE

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:40.417
WE. TIMELINE WISE WITH RESPECT

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:42.485
TO DEVELOPMENT OF- OFFSHORE WIND

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:46.489
AND IF WE SPEND THIS MONEY- HOW

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:47.891
SOON DO YOU THINK WE COULD

00:53:47.958 --> 00:53:53.029
ACTUALLY BEGIN DEPLOYING-

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:56.099
VISIBILITIES- IN OUR OFFSHORE

00:53:56.166 --> 00:53:59.402
AREAS IN THE STATE AND R. THIS

00:53:59.469 --> 00:54:01.471
IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ALREADY

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:02.639
BEEN DEPLOYED MANY PARTS OF THE

00:54:02.706 --> 00:54:05.475
WORLD. AND ON THE EAST COAST I'M

00:54:05.542 --> 00:54:06.876
NOT SURE WHERE ELSE IN THE

00:54:06.943 --> 00:54:10.981
UNITED STATES- IT STRIKES ME

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:12.549
THAT WORLD A LITTLE BIT BEHIND-

00:54:12.616 --> 00:54:15.251
US IN THIS DEPLOYMENT SO- IF YOU

00:54:15.318 --> 00:54:17.487
CAN. COMMENT ON THAT I'D

00:54:17.554 --> 00:54:19.422
APPRECIATE IT AND IF WE WANT TO

00:54:19.489 --> 00:54:21.958
ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS WHAT

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:26.096
WOULD WE NEED TO DO. QUESTIONS

00:54:26.162 --> 00:54:27.530
THE ENERGY VISIONS AND WORKING

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:28.732
ON OFFSHORE WIND NOW FOR A

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.333
NUMBER OF YEARS AND THIS

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.202
ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC

00:54:32.268 --> 00:54:33.436
IS THIS REALLY SUPPORT OF IN

00:54:33.503 --> 00:54:35.238
FACT. THE VICE ADMINISTRATION

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.640
ANNOUNCED RECENTLY A NATIONWIDE

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:39.442
GOAL THIRTY GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.611
THIRTY AND- COULD WE PULL IT OFF

00:54:41.678 --> 00:54:43.380
BY TWENTY THIRTY I THINK IT'S

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:45.849
POSSIBLE- BUT- WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.450
WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BUREAU

00:54:47.517 --> 00:54:48.284
OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT

00:54:48.351 --> 00:54:50.220
BOWMAN. AND THERE THE CHIEF

00:54:50.286 --> 00:54:51.855
AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S INVOLVED

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:54.057
AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE- BEEN ABLE

00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:55.592
TO OVERCOME A LOT OF THE LOT OF

00:54:55.659 --> 00:54:57.160
THE BARRIERS WITH LOTS OF ISSUES

00:54:57.227 --> 00:54:59.129
WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD OFF OFF

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:00.196
THE COAST. WE'RE TALKING QUITE

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:02.332
FAR OFF THE COAST TO IN THE TWO

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:03.366
PRINCIPAL AREAS ARE IN THE

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:05.502
CENTRAL COAST AND IN THE NORTH

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:06.503
COAST THE CENTRAL COAST HAS

00:55:06.569 --> 00:55:08.872
EXCELLENT ON SHORE. CAPABILITIES

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.707
TO ACCEPT POWER AND WE'LL AROUND

00:55:10.774 --> 00:55:13.443
THE STATE NORTH COAST NOT AS NOT

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.578
AS GOOD BUT IT'S ABOUT A

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.479
RESOURCE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:17.947
IS WE'RE LOOKING AT QUITE A

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.649
DISTANCE OFF SHORE TWENTY MILES

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:22.419
PLUS AND- IT'S VERY DEEP WATER

00:55:22.485 --> 00:55:24.287
SO UNLIKE A LOT OF THE PLACES

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.556
THAT HAVE BUILT A LOT OF WIND TO

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.924
DATE. WE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO

00:55:27.991 --> 00:55:29.292
TETHER IT TO THE TO THE BOTTOM

00:55:29.359 --> 00:55:30.560
OF THE OCEAN QUITE ADEPT IT

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:32.495
WOULDN'T BE A- YOU KNOW A LARGE

00:55:32.562 --> 00:55:34.097
SUPERSTRUCTURE MOUNTED DIRECTLY

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.865
TO THE BOTTOM OF A SEXUALLY

00:55:35.932 --> 00:55:36.933
EXPLODING. AND IT'S DONE BEING

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.101
DONE AROUND THE WORLD IT'S NOT

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.869
IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED BUT IT'S

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.638
ALSO NOT COMMON SO WE'VE GOT A

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:43.506
LOT TO LEARN WHAT WE'RE HOPING

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:44.741
TO DO WITH THIS WITH THIS

00:55:44.808 --> 00:55:46.543
FUNDING IS START TO PAVE THE

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:48.044
WAY. THEY HAVE YOUR QUESTION

00:55:48.111 --> 00:55:48.678
DIRECTLY WORKING WAS INTRODUCED

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.413
TO SPEED THINGS UP. I THINK A

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:53.116
LOT OF THE TIMING HAS TO DO WITH

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.518
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ITS

00:55:55.585 --> 00:55:57.754
PROCESS OF- THE DEADLINE LEASE

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.756
AREAS HOLDING LEASE SALES AND

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:00.590
THAT SORT OF THING YOU'VE

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:01.858
PROBABLY READ EITHER OCCURRING

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:09.132
ON THE- EAST COAST. AND. WE'RE

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:10.867
EAGER TO SEE THE MOVE. AS WELL.

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.001
THANK YOU AND HAVE MY FIVE CALL-

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:13.670
IS- ON THE TOPIC OF BUILDING GOT

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:17.273
DECARBONISATION- THE L. A. OAK-

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.543
OBSERVES THAT- MORE DETAILS- IS

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:24.447
NECESSARY ASSUME. THAT WILL BE

00:56:24.514 --> 00:56:27.650
WEEKS BUT- THE L. A. O. ALSO-

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:29.486
ASKS THE QUESTIONS A LITTLE BIT

00:56:29.552 --> 00:56:31.721
IN YOUR FACE SO I APOLOGIZE FOR

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:32.655
THAT BUT- IT'S WHY THE ENERGY

00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:34.758
COMMISSION- SENSORS OTHER

00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.993
DEPARTMENTS THAT. I HISTORICALLY

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:38.595
HAVE DONE PROJECTS LIKE THIS

00:56:38.661 --> 00:56:42.031
WIOQ- SHIFT SOME OF THESE

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:43.399
RESPONSIBILITIES. TO THE ENERGY

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:46.603
COMMISSION. PERFECTLY LEGIT

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:49.405
QUESTION WE- WE TALKED TO THE

00:56:49.472 --> 00:56:51.341
OTHER. POSSIBLE ENTITIES IN

00:56:51.407 --> 00:56:53.643
CALIFORNIA CHIEF AMONG THEM ONE

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:55.245
ONE THAT ROSS SPELLED OUT WHICH

00:56:55.311 --> 00:56:57.647
IS SIXTY THE COMMUNITY. SERVICES

00:56:57.714 --> 00:57:00.717
AND DEVELOPMENT- DEPARTMENT AND-

00:57:00.784 --> 00:57:02.752
ESSENTIALLY WE ALL AGREED WE

00:57:02.819 --> 00:57:04.220
CAME TO AN AGREEMENT INTERNALLY

00:57:04.287 --> 00:57:05.588
THAT ENERGY COMMISSION WAS THE

00:57:05.655 --> 00:57:07.190
MOST SENSIBLE PLACE TO DO THIS

00:57:07.257 --> 00:57:08.591
WE MANAGED OVER THREE HUNDRED

00:57:08.658 --> 00:57:09.993
MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY.

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:11.594
BACK IN YOUR DAYS AND THERE ARE

00:57:11.661 --> 00:57:13.363
SOME SMALL ONES FUNDS COMING

00:57:13.429 --> 00:57:15.064
CALIFORNIA'S WAY FROM THE FROM

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.499
THE FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE

00:57:16.566 --> 00:57:17.567
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IN THAT

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:19.669
AREA. AND WE'VE GOT LOTS OF

00:57:19.736 --> 00:57:20.537
EXPERIENCE WITH ENERGY ENERGY

00:57:20.603 --> 00:57:22.639
EFFICIENCY PROBABLY NOBODY KNOWS

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.641
MORE ABOUT IT IN THE STATE THAN

00:57:24.707 --> 00:57:26.376
THAN THAT THAN THAN THE ENERGY

00:57:26.442 --> 00:57:28.378
COMMISSION. WE ALSO- WE ALSO

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.747
MOVEMENT A LOT OF MONEY AND-

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.515
WEEK YOU LEARN THINGS WHEN YOU

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:33.416
DO THAT ABOUT HOW TO AVOID

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:35.451
MISTAKES AND- THAT'S IT THANKS I

00:57:35.518 --> 00:57:37.387
THINK WE'RE WELL EQUIPPED TO DO

00:57:37.453 --> 00:57:39.289
IT. AND FINALLY I'D SAY IT'S

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.456
GOING TO BE. SOMEWHAT

00:57:40.523 --> 00:57:41.758
COMPLICATED THE CST PROGRAMS

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:43.593
TEND TO BE VERY TARGETED TOWARDS

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.161
WEATHERIZATION TYPE THINGS LIKE

00:57:45.228 --> 00:57:47.697
INSULATION BETTER WINDOWS- OTHER

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.899
BETTER ENVELOPE TYPE MEASURES

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.601
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT SOME

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:53.036
COMPLICATED ONES LIKE ELECTRIC.

00:57:53.102 --> 00:57:55.104
APPLIANCES ELECTRIC HOT WATER

00:57:55.171 --> 00:57:57.507
HEATERS ELECTRIC- SPACE HEATERS

00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:00.510
AND COOLERS AND- THE TECHNOLOGY

00:58:00.577 --> 00:58:02.345
BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.947
DEPENDING ON YOUR FACILITY YOU

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.849
MIGHT NEED A PANEL UPGRADE

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:06.416
BECAUSE YOU'RE DRUNK MORE

00:58:06.482 --> 00:58:08.184
ELECTRICITY THAN YOUR HOME OR

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:09.252
BUSINESS WAS DESIGNED TO.

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:10.353
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATING

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.521
FACTORS AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK

00:58:11.588 --> 00:58:13.456
WE'D WOULD BE WELL SUITED AS A

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:15.592
AS THE STATE ENTITY THAT TO

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:16.926
MANAGE THIS BY THE WAY WE'RE

00:58:16.993 --> 00:58:18.461
GONNA WILL PLANNING TO HIRE OUT.

00:58:18.528 --> 00:58:20.196
TO HAVE BEEN ADMINISTRATOR DO

00:58:20.263 --> 00:58:22.498
THE ACTUAL INTERFACE WITH THE

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:23.967
WITH THE ULTIMATE FOLKS WOULD

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:29.806
GET THE MONEY BUT. WE WOULD WE

00:58:29.873 --> 00:58:31.374
WOULD MANAGE THE ENTERPRISE. SO

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:32.575
ON THE QUESTION A- SO ARE THIS

00:58:32.642 --> 00:58:35.411
IS. A STAFF REAL- WITH OTHER-

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:40.416

WE'RE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CST

00:58:48.191 --> 00:58:50.894
CST DOES HAVE A LOT OF ACTUAL

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:51.527
RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY BUILT

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:53.496
THEIR AIR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.365
THAT HAVE DONE SO AS WELL BUT I

00:58:55.431 --> 00:58:57.033
DON'T THINK- THIS IS A

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:58.301
SUBSTANTIAL PART OF MONEY AND WE

BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IT

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:01.157
SEEMS THAT ONE. AREA REALLY

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.259
WASN'T TOUCHED ON WHICH IS.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.328
MOVING TOWARD- COMPLETELY

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:06.863
EXTRICATION FOR BUILDINGS I

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:08.464
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.433
THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS AS TO. HEAR

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.834
WHAT ROLE THEY ENERGY COMMISSION

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.703
WANTS TO PLAY ON THAT ISSUE I

01:01:13.770 --> 01:01:15.471
KNOW THE CPUC BROTHERS A BIGGER

01:01:15.538 --> 01:01:18.775
ROLE TO PLAY BUT JUST CURIOUS

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.209
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE.

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:22.545
CERTAINLY WE ADOPTED STANDARDS-

01:01:22.612 --> 01:01:24.247
THAT STANDARDS WANT TO AFFECT

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.115
LAST YEAR BUILDING STANDARDS

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:28.518
THAT WE ADOPT ON A ON A ROUGHLY

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.487
THREE YEAR CYCLE AND- WE WERE WE

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:33.189
FOR THE FIRST TIME REQUIRED THAT

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.591
ALL NEW COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE-

01:01:35.658 --> 01:01:36.559
STRUCTURES WITH WITHIN A CERTAIN

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.295
RANGE. B. THEY HAVE SOARED ON

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.531
THEM WHICH MATCHED OUR- EARLIER

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.366
REQUIREMENT THAT THAT TAKE PLACE

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.301
ON RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS SO THAT

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:46.836
WAS ONE BIG YOU KNOW DOWN

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:48.004
PAYMENT ON ELECTRIFICATION AND

01:01:48.071 --> 01:01:49.806
DECARBONISATION OF BUILDINGS. WE

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.441
ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE BUILDINGS

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:54.043
BE BE READY TO BE ELECTRIFIED

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:55.545
SUB SO THERE'S NOT AN APP

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:57.380
THERE'S NOT A MANDATE THAT ALL

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.481
NEW BUILDINGS GOING FORWARD MUST

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.949
BE. ZERO EMISSION OR MUST BE

01:02:00.016 --> 01:02:01.417
ENTIRELY ELECTRIC BUT WE'RE

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:02.985
WE'RE PAVING THE WAY AND A LOT

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.922
OF- PROGRESSIVE BUILDERS ARE

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:06.956

IN THE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL SPACE

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.894
SO WE'RE EAGER TO. SEE THAT

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.362
HAPPEN AND THERE WERE MANY WHO

01:02:13.429 --> 01:02:14.497
FELT LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE PUSHED

01:02:14.564 --> 01:02:16.899
IN OUR LAST BUILDING CODE CYCLE

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:18.367
TO MANDATE BOB WELL EDUCATION

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.570
AND WE- MY BOSSES THE

01:02:20.636 --> 01:02:22.405
COMMISSIONS THAT CHOSE NOT TO DO

01:02:22.472 --> 01:02:24.974
THAT AT THIS TIME BUT- I THINK

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.676
WE'RE REALLY WELL ON THE WAY. TO

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:31.547
THAT. TO THAT OUTCOME. THANK THE

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.382

01:02:36.285 --> 01:02:38.354
THE LOS LIKE PAYING THE GOLDEN.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.323
ITS MARKETS CAN'T GO BRIDGE YOU

01:02:40.389 --> 01:02:42.024

MINUTES AND YOU START SO WE'VE

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:46.529
WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING HEAVILY

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.564
ALREADY ON THE NEXT CYCLE THE

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:50.833
LAST CYCLE WE REFER TO AS OUR

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:52.368
TWENTY NINETEEN STANDARDS. AND

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.336
WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE CALLING

01:02:53.402 --> 01:02:54.704
THESE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:56.672
STANDARDS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.375
ADOPTING IN IN CALENDAR YEAR

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.543
TWENTY TWENTY TO THE NEXT THE

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.211
NEXT ROUND OF STANDARDS THAT

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.579
THEY GET THEY GET EVER TIGHTER-

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.047
IN TERMS OF REDUCING ENERGY

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:05.982
CONSUMPTION GREAT AND I MAY

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:07.950
NEVER REALLY URGE ALL THE ALL

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:08.618
THE COMMISSIONS TO REALLY TAKE A

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.987
HARD LOOK AT. DOING A MANDATE IT

01:03:11.053 --> 01:03:12.722
DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO MAKE

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:15.358
SENSE AS WERE PUTTING UP- NEW

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.126
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS WHETHER

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.327
WE'RE- BUT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:20.096
BUILD NATURAL GAS PIPELINES INTO

01:03:20.163 --> 01:03:22.798
THOSE- NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.734
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.004
LOOK AT- NEW BUILDINGS AND TRY

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.172
TO HAVE THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:03:29.238 --> 01:03:31.240
THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALL ELECTRIC

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.042
OR NOT I THINK THAT. THE STATE

01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:34.510
NEEDS TO TAKE A MUCH STRONGER

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:36.746
ROLE IN PROVIDING THAT DIRECTION

01:03:36.812 --> 01:03:39.649
TOWARD A LECTURE FOR CATION-

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:41.217
BECAUSE I THINK IF THEY DON'T DO

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.685
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HODGE PODGE

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:44.253
OF STANDARDS AND THEN WHAT

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.521
YOU'RE GONNA END UP DOING IS-

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:47.490
IT'LL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:03:47.557 --> 01:03:49.025
TRANSITION IF YOU ACTUALLY PUT

01:03:49.091 --> 01:03:51.527
UP NEW BUILDINGS. WITH NATURAL

01:03:51.594 --> 01:03:52.595
GAS THAT GOES INTO RUSSIA

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:54.664
BROTHER WE HAVE ALL THE

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.465
TECHNOLOGY WE NEED. IT'S VERY

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:58.668
SIMPLE TO MOVE FORWARD- WE COULD

01:03:58.734 --> 01:04:00.436
EVEN DO OF MORE WATER

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.338
RECAPTURING IS SO JUST SEEMS

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:04.774
THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO- SET A

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.677
CLEAR DIRECTION ABOUT WHERE WE'D

01:04:07.743 --> 01:04:09.645
LIKE TO GO RATHER THAN JUST

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:11.347
LEAVING IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL.

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:13.216
BUILDING DEVELOPERS AND BUILDING

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:15.251
OWNERS AS TO AS TO WHERE THEY

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:16.986
SHOULD GO BECAUSE- WE'RE CLEARLY

01:04:17.053 --> 01:04:18.721
NOT GOING TO MAKE OUR YOU KNOW

01:04:18.788 --> 01:04:21.057
I'M OUR GOALS IF WE CONTINUE TO-

01:04:21.123 --> 01:04:22.491
SEND MIXED SIGNALS READ

01:04:22.558 --> 01:04:23.259
REGARDING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.127
REDUCTIONS- REGARDING ALL OF

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:26.495
PARIS CLIMATE GOALS I THINK IT'S

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:32.835
REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO. ON

01:04:32.902 --> 01:04:35.037
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE SO

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.272
WITH THAT THE TWENTY. TO

01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:37.673
ADOPTION WOULD YOU THINK THOSE

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:40.476
WILL BE ADOPTED OR CONSIDERED.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.411
BOB WHAT THE HOPE IS THAT THEY

01:04:42.478 --> 01:04:43.879
THAT THEY GET ADOPTED AND INTEL

01:04:43.946 --> 01:04:46.015
ENCOUNTER YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:47.783
AND THEN THERE'S A LAG BUT AS TO

01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:49.619
WHEN THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE WHICH

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.720
TYPICALLY ABOUT A YEAR A YEAR

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.622
AFTER THAT TO GIVE THE INDUSTRY

01:04:52.688 --> 01:04:53.956
AN OPPORTUNTY TO ADJUST. AND

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:55.391
WHAT WE WHAT WE DO IN OUR

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.159
STANDARDS AS WE PROVIDE MULTIPLE

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.527
PATHWAYS TO COMPLIANCE IN THE

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:00.196
BUILDING INDUSTRY'S. BETTER

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.298
ENGAGED IN AND DEVELOPING LIKE

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.766
THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.034
PRESCRIPTIVE PATH WE BASICALLY

PROVIDE A LISTING IF YOU CHECK

01:05:06.669 --> 01:05:09.372
ALL THESE BOXES. YOU SATISFY THE

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:12.408
STANDARDS MORE. MORE PLAYERS

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:15.745
LIKE TO USE- A DIFFERENT

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.413
APPROACH WHERE YOU CAN TRADE AND

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.814
- ON WHAT CLIMATE ZONE YOU'RE IN

01:05:18.881 --> 01:05:19.715
OR WHAT BUILDING MATERIALS RE

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:22.018
AVAILABLE OR WHAT STYLE BUILDING

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:24.020
YOU DO. YOU MIGHT FIND AS A

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:24.987
BUILDER ONE. APPROACH TO MEETING

01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:26.055
THE STANDARDS OF MORE APPEALING

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:27.556
THAN ANOTHER AND YOU'RE FREE TO

01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:29.158
DO THAT AS FAR AS RATCHETING

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:31.794
DOWN TO MANDATING. ALL LIKE

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:33.663
CREEK THAT'S A THAT'S I MEAN IN

01:05:33.729 --> 01:05:35.331
TERMS OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:36.732
DURING THAT THAT REALLY REMAINS

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:37.633
TO BE SEEN AND CERTAINLY THE

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.335
LEGISLATURE- CAN HAVE THOSE

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:41.170
DISCUSSIONS AS WELL. NO PRE

01:05:41.237 --> 01:05:43.039
APPRECIATE THAT MCGETTIGAN YEAH

01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.740
I THINK- ENERGY COMMISSION TOOK

01:05:44.807 --> 01:05:47.076
A HUGE LEADERSHIP ROLE AND-

01:05:47.143 --> 01:05:48.678
ASKING THAT ALL NEW RESIDENTIAL

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:50.446
BUILDINGS YOU JUST HIS HIDE YOU

01:05:50.513 --> 01:05:52.148
KNOW. CITED THIS AROUND

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:53.382
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS HAVEN'T.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.051
ROOFTOP SOLAR SO THAT WASN'T

01:05:55.117 --> 01:05:56.352
THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT PASS

01:05:56.419 --> 01:05:58.521
ON THAT SO I DON'T THINK THERE

01:05:58.587 --> 01:05:59.789
SHOULD REALLY BE. A DIFFERENT

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:01.624
PATH. FOR CATIA IS VERY CLEAR-

01:06:01.691 --> 01:06:02.658
THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR THIS

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.794
IS THE DIRECTION. THAT WE NEED

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.595

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:09.432
FIRE OUR ENTIRE- GREETED IN OUR

01:06:09.498 --> 01:06:11.767
ENTIRE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. SO

01:06:11.834 --> 01:06:13.402
THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.304
HAVE A GROUP FULL OF CLEAN

01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:17.606
ENERGY IN FOR A BUILDING NOT TO

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:19.775
BE USING THAT CLEAN ELECTRIC

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:23.145
GRID SO- I GET AGAIN- YOU KNOW

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.880
I'LL BE TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:26.148

BUSINESSES. IT'S UNREMARKABLE.

01:06:55.578 --> 01:06:56.879
IT'S ALSO RELATIVELY UNCOMMON IN

01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.180

TO THAT QUESTION I DON'T THINK

01:08:23.165 --> 01:08:25.201
IT'S THAT HIGH I THINK IT'S-

01:08:25.267 --> 01:08:27.436
WILL LOWER THE 25% BUT WE CAN

01:08:27.503 --> 01:08:28.704
GET YOU THOSE PRECISE NUMBERS

RECYCLE THE WATER BACK UP TO

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:21.457
THE- POWER PLANT I CURRENTLY

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.658
UNDERSTAND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.294

TO EVEN GET INDIA ELECTORS

01:09:27.463 --> 01:09:27.997
ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.232
HYDROELECTRIC PLANT. I KNOW THE

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.101
FUNDING- GOING TO THE FUTURE FOR

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.235
IT AND WE MIGHT HAVE WATER TO

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:35.371
FUTURE WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING ZERO

01:09:35.437 --> 01:09:37.273
ELECTRICITY AT OUT OF OR BILL. A

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:42.778
HYDROELECTRIC DAM CURRENTLY.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:44.847
YEAH GOOD MORNING MEMBER THIS IS

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:47.216
THAT. TED CRADDOCK. RIGHT NOW

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.218
THEY WERE A BILL WE THE WATER

01:09:49.285 --> 01:09:50.519
LEVEL IS HIGH ENOUGH WHERE WE

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.488
PRESUME THAT POWER OPERATIONS

01:09:52.555 --> 01:09:54.857
OUT OF THE LAKE- THAT HAPPENED.

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.725
IN THE DECEMBER TIME FRAME SO WE

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:58.694
DID HAVE A BRIEF PERIOD BECAUSE

01:09:58.761 --> 01:10:00.529
OF THE EXTREME DROUGHT. I

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.431
WOULDN'T LAKE FELL BELOW- THE

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:04.133
POWER PLAN ELEVATION BUT WE'RE

01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:07.303
BACK IN OPPOSITION NOW. IN I

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.337
KNOW WE ALL WANT TO GO

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:09.905
ELECTRICITY BUT CURRENTLY

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.141
CALIFORNIA STILL. CONSUMING ONE

01:10:12.207 --> 01:10:14.143
POINT MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE

01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:17.046
OIL EVERY DAY. WE'RE IMPORTING

01:10:17.112 --> 01:10:19.048
ONE POINT FOUR MILLION BARRELS A

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:21.550
DAY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THEN

01:10:21.617 --> 01:10:23.519
I'LL GO AHEAD AND RUSSIA. THE

01:10:23.586 --> 01:10:26.221
RAINFOREST. IS BEING DESTROYED

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:30.159
IN THIS WORLD WE'RE TRYING TO.

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.460
SAVE THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA.

01:10:31.527 --> 01:10:33.228
BUT WHY ARE WE NOT APPROVING

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.730
PERMITS TO DRILL OIL IN

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:35.831
CALIFORNIA SO WE DON'T HAVE TO

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:38.000
IMPORTED OIL. THE SOUTH COAST

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.368
AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT

01:10:39.435 --> 01:10:41.503
MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. THEIR

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:44.006
SCIENTIFIC STUDY. THAT IS THE

01:10:44.073 --> 01:10:45.941
THOSE OF SUPERTANKERS IS THE

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.677
HIGHEST NUMBER ONE POLLUTED IN

01:10:48.744 --> 01:10:51.547
THE LA BASIN. SO I DON'T KNOW

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:52.348
WHERE IT'S GONNA GO BUT I DO

01:10:52.414 --> 01:10:54.316
BELIEVE WE CAN'T JUST TURN THE

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:55.784
SWITCH ON TO ELECTRICITY WE

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:58.020
STILL NEED TO PRODUCE OIL. AND

01:10:58.087 --> 01:11:00.122
SLOWLY GO TO ELECTRICITY YOU'RE

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:01.790
CUTTING OUT AN INDUSTRY WE'RE

01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:04.159
STILL IMPORTING THAT OIL STILL

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.594
AFFECTING THE AIR STILL

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:07.496
AFFECTING THE RESIDENTS AND I

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:09.832
THINK WE NEED TO DRILL OIL IN

01:11:09.898 --> 01:11:11.100
CALIFORNIA EXPRESSLY RIGHT NOW

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.534
IN THE TIME OF THE WORLD. WE

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:14.236
NEED TO BE TRY TO BE SELF

01:11:14.303 --> 01:11:15.137
SUFFICIENT HERE WITHOUT

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:15.771
IMPORTING. FROM FOREIGN

01:11:15.838 --> 01:11:17.573
COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.341
LABOR STANDARDS DO NOT HAVE THE

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:21.343
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE MIGHT

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.712
BE FIXING IT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:26.148
THE AIR FROM THE REST OF THE

01:11:26.215 --> 01:11:28.050
WORLD STILL CYCLES OF THE EARTH

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.251
. THAT'LL BE MY COMMENT. ALL

RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT IF WE

01:12:01.016 --> 01:12:03.519
CAN I WOULD SURE APPRECIATE.

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:05.287
HAVING THEM HERE AND NOT MISS.

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.322
THE KEY WORDS IN AN AND ALL OF

01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:10.092
THAT BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS- IS

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.261
JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:14.263
BE ABLE TO RIGHT I THINK HERE

01:12:14.329 --> 01:12:15.564
ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:17.266
ARE PRESENT RIGHT- THANK YOU I

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:18.801
THANK YOU AND IF YOU ARE HAVING.

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:20.936
TROUBLE HEARING- SOMETIMES WE

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.438
CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.339
ACCOUNT THAT ARE HELPFUL I KNOW

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:26.275
THE FIRST DOES BECAUSE A LITTLE

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:29.078
BIT MUFFLED TO. GREAT THANK YOU-

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:31.313
AT SIX THE SECONDLY- FOR

01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.016
DIRECTOR BOTTOM- AND THAT- I

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.884
REALLY APPLAUD THE-

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:39.221
ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO- TRY

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.255
TO MOVE US TOWARDS GREEN

01:12:40.322 --> 01:12:41.623
HYDROGEN THE HUNDRED MILLION

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.325
DOLLARS- THAT A STATE IS FUNDED

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:45.194
THERE- I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:48.063
ESSENTIAL. FOR US TO GET A NEW A

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:50.232
NEW ENERGY SOURCE OF FOR GOING

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:52.434
TO DO IT ON A ON A MASSIVE SCALE

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.937
FOR US TO MOVE AS QUICKLY TO THE

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:56.572
GREEN. HYDROGEN AS POSSIBLE- SO

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:59.975
THAT- WE GET THOSE BENEFITS AND

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.411
WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.779
ENERGY ON SOMETHING INTERMITTENT

01:13:03.846 --> 01:13:07.182
THAT- CHEWS UP RESOURCES- I

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.351
WOULD LIKE TO. POINT OUT THAT

01:13:09.418 --> 01:13:11.120
THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT AS YOU

01:13:11.186 --> 01:13:12.521
ARE TRYING TO WORK ON THE

01:13:12.588 --> 01:13:13.756
TECHNOLOGY AND I REALLY

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:14.556
APPRECIATE THE GERMAN

01:13:14.623 --> 01:13:16.325
BREWMASTER. I THINK THE MOST

01:13:16.391 --> 01:13:17.426
APPROPRIATE QUESTION WHAT

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:18.393
PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO BE ON

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:21.764
ELECTROLYSIS- AND- TO MAKE SURE

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.432
THAT THERE WERE FOCUSED ON THAT.

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.167
AND YOU POINTED OUT THAT TRYING

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.169
TO GET IT WHERE. IT COULD BE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.471
PRODUCED AT. LIKE AT A SOLAR

01:13:29.538 --> 01:13:31.907
FARM- SO IT WOULD BE RIGHT THERE

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.876
IN TERMS OF LOCATION BUT

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.377
HYDROGEN DOES HAVE THE-

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.946
POTENTIAL TO BE MOVED AROUND BY

01:13:38.013 --> 01:13:41.183
HYDROGEN TRUCKS- AND HYDROGEN

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.285
TRUCKS. HAULING HYDROGEN TO

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:46.155
OTHER PLACES COULD BE A VERY LOW

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:49.324
CARBON ORDERS HAVE APPROACH ALL

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:52.027
THE WAY AROUND- ENJOY JUST ASK

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.862
US TO IT WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:59.635
AT. THE SYNERGIES. OF OKAY I

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:01.537
REGION AT THE SOLE OUR FARM SIDE

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:03.539
OF IT- OTHER OP. FOR THE PURGE

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.907
PRODUCTION OF ELECT- FOR THE

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:06.608
GREEN HYDROGEN- SEEM TO ME TO BE

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.344
APPROPRIATE ALSO- MY- NEXT

01:14:09.411 --> 01:14:13.448
COMMENT- IS- THE LONG MIGHT NEXT

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:16.051
QUESTION IS FOR THE LONG TERM

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:19.087
STORAGE- OPTION. I NOTED IN THE

01:14:19.154 --> 01:14:21.356
PRESENTATION BY THE L. A. O.

01:14:21.423 --> 01:14:23.525
HYDROGEN IS NOT LISTED AND COULD

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.294
YOU ANSWER FOR ME- DIRECTOR

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.831
BOND. IS HYDROGEN. A CONCERT

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:30.265
GOER GOING TO BE CONSIDERED ONE

01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:31.733
OF THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:34.236
WE WOULD BE CONSTRUED LOOKING

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.370
OUT FOR LONG TERM STORAGE.

01:14:35.437 --> 01:14:38.841
ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:41.243
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT IT AS A

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.612
PIECE OF THE HUNDRED MILLION

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.647
THAT'S DEDICATED CHIEFLY TO

01:14:45.714 --> 01:14:47.316
ISSUE COULD YOU NOTED- ARE

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.684
PROPOSALS TO CHEAPLY DEDICATE

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.752
THAT TOWARD ELECTROLYSIS BUT WE

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.254
WOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER PARTS

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.189
OF THE CHAIN INCLUDING INCLUDING

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.358
STORAGE- I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:59.061
REFERRING MORE TO THE GRID SCALE

01:14:59.127 --> 01:15:01.029
STORAGE- VERSUS TANKS AND THAT

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.865
SORT OF THING FOR MORE READY USE

01:15:02.931 --> 01:15:05.667
BUT BUT WE THINK WE NEED TO LOOK

01:15:05.734 --> 01:15:06.501
AT ALL THOSE PIECES IN THE

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.437
INDUSTRY SPOKE ABOUT HYDROGEN SO

01:15:08.503 --> 01:15:09.271
THE NUMBER THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THE

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.206
FLAG A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE ISSUES

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:13.842
THAT WE JUST NEED TO GET. A LOT

01:15:13.909 --> 01:15:14.576
MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT YOU CAN

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:15.944
DEFINITELY TRY CUT AGAIN BUT

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.446
WHEN YOU COMPRESS IT YOU YOU

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:19.081
BURN A LOT OF ENERGY COMPRESSING

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:20.649
IF YOU LOOK A FIGHT YOU BRING

01:15:20.716 --> 01:15:21.683
EVEN MORE ENERGY SO THERE'S

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.685
COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE ALL

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:26.021
THE MULTIPLE APPROACHES AND WE

01:15:26.088 --> 01:15:27.656
NEED TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:28.690
THEIR PHYSICALLY THE SIX COULD

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:32.961
BE LOCATED IN WHAT THE TRADE

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:33.729
OFFS ARE. WELL I AT. I

01:15:33.795 --> 01:15:35.297
APPRECIATE THAT IT AYE AYE SIR

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:36.431
SHARE. CHAIR BLOOM- INTO IN THE

01:15:36.498 --> 01:15:39.668
HYDE. AND THE COMMENTS AND AN

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:41.737
INTERESTED- THAT HE'S

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.372
DEMONSTRATED AND THEN CERTAINLY

01:15:43.438 --> 01:15:45.307
SUPPORT THAT- THANK YOU VERY

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.209
MUCH FOR THAT. IF I COULD GO TO

01:15:47.276 --> 01:15:50.178
THE PORCH- AND- EIGHT A QUESTION

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:54.082
THAT I HAVE- WITH THE IF WINCH.

01:15:54.149 --> 01:15:55.918
THE OFFSHORE WIND. MY

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:56.985
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:59.221
ASSEMBLY OF THESE BIG WIND

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:02.190
TURBINES THE CLOSER WE DO IT TO

01:16:02.257 --> 01:16:03.692
THE SHIP THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING

01:16:03.759 --> 01:16:05.594
TO TAKE THEM OUT. BETTER OFF

01:16:05.661 --> 01:16:07.930
WE'RE GOING TO BE- IS THERE ANY

01:16:07.996 --> 01:16:10.132
ATTENTION YET BEING PAID TO. HOW

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:13.602
WE MIGHT LOCATE THE ASSEMBLY OF

01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:16.038
THESE BIG WIND TURBINES- THAT

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:20.042
NEAR THE PORCH- SO THAT- WE-

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:21.677
DON'T HAVE THE AWKWARDNESS OF

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:23.211
TRYING TO TRANSPORT TO A BIG

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.981
WIND TURBINES- FROM THE ASSEMBLY

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:30.953
POINT- TO THOSE PORTS. ANY ANY-

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:32.387
IT EXPLORATION OF THAT YET.

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:33.655
ABSOLUTELY THAT'S PART OF WHAT

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.357
WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT I THINK

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.892
YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:38.927
THAT THESE ARE LARGE THE YOU

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:40.162
KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.531
OF THE LONG TURBINES TODAY AND

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:43.999
THEY'RE GETTING LONGER EVERY DAY

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.368
IN THE MEGAWATTS PER. TURBINE IS

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.603
GOING UP EVERY DAY AND SO WE'RE

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:50.572
IN THE PERFECT SPOT TO IT TO

01:16:50.639 --> 01:16:51.740
ADAPT TO THAT BUT BUT MOVING

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.675
THOSE THINGS EVEN FROM SOME OF

01:16:53.742 --> 01:16:54.609
THE PARTY CALIFORNIA TO THE

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.778
COAST IS NO TRIVIAL MATTER SO.

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:58.880
ABSOLUTELY LOOKING AT THE

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:01.450
POSSIBILITY OF ONSITE PRODUCTION

01:17:01.516 --> 01:17:03.151
TO LOAD RIGHT ONTO A SHIP TO

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:05.654
TAKE THEM OUT TO SEA IS THIS

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:06.688
SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:08.824
CLOSELY. GREAT THANK YOU AND MY

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.792
QUESTION IS- PROBABLY FOR D. W.

01:17:10.859 --> 01:17:12.494
R. HERE REGARDING THE PUMP

01:17:12.561 --> 01:17:16.231
STORAGE AT- ORVILLE- STE. I'M

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:19.568
CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF- OF ALL

01:17:19.634 --> 01:17:21.903
OF THE- CARBON NEUTRAL

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:23.238
APPROACHES THAT WE CAN WE CAN

01:17:23.305 --> 01:17:26.074
COME UP WITH- MY QUESTION FOR-

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:28.977
D. W. OURS. DO YOU HAVE DATA ON

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:31.113
THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF PUMPED

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:33.548
STORAGE. VERSUS YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:17:33.615 --> 01:17:36.084
USING THE EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:38.387
FOR PUMPED STORAGE- AND HOW DOES

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:39.888
THAT COMPARE TO USING THAT

01:17:39.955 --> 01:17:41.757
EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY FOR SOME

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:45.327
OTHER- SOME OTHER ENERGY

01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:48.463
PRODUCING- CAPABILITY BECAUSE AS

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:52.000
WE- HAVE HAD THE QUESTION- FROM

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:55.704
MISTER. SMITH I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:57.339
MEMBER AGREED THAT- ALL ALL

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.508
CORRECTOR BUT- AS WE HAD A

01:17:59.574 --> 01:18:02.611
QUESTION ABOUT- THE NEW NORMAL

01:18:02.677 --> 01:18:03.712
WE HAVE IN TERMS OF WATER

01:18:03.779 --> 01:18:05.647
SUPPLY. WE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.450
WATER. TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:10.619
CONSISTENTLY USE THAT SO IS THIS

01:18:10.685 --> 01:18:12.554
GOING TO BE THE BEST INVESTMENT

01:18:12.621 --> 01:18:14.689
OF THAT SOLAR ENERGY- IS MY

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:17.926
QUESTION- WHEN WE MAY NOT BE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:19.428
ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:21.296
WATER TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY. SO

01:18:21.363 --> 01:18:22.731
DO YOU HAVE DATA ON HOW

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:25.267
EFFICIENT THAT IS VERSES- THE

01:18:25.333 --> 01:18:27.102
OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF THAT

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:28.770
SOLAR ENERGY THAT EXCESS SOLAR

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:33.208
ENERGY. FOR TO PRODUCE OTHER

01:18:33.275 --> 01:18:34.309
RENEWABLE ENERGIES. FOUR YEAH

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.677
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:38.213
MEMBER IT'S MAYBE TWO PIECES TO

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.148
THAT ONE AS A RELATED TO THE

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.918
ENERGY EFFICIENCY. OF THE SYSTEM

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:46.088
SO I'M STORAGE- IS GENERALLY A

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:48.757
CLOSED SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO

01:18:48.824 --> 01:18:50.192
WATER BODIES THAT YOU'RE

01:18:50.258 --> 01:18:52.994
TRANSFERRING. WATER TO AND FROM

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.930
IN THE CASE OF A QUORUM BELL

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:57.132
WILL ALSO HAVE- NO FLOW THAT

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:59.334
COMES INTO THE LAKE AND PASSES

01:18:59.401 --> 01:19:01.369
OUT OF THE LAKE- SO IT'S A

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.939
COMBINATION OF PROCS- BUT BUT

01:19:04.005 --> 01:19:06.141
GENERALLY THE LAKE YOU KNOW

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.777
UNDER. MOST OPERATIONS SCENARIOS

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.379
HAS THE CAPABILITY TO. TO

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.548
OPERATE A HIGH IN IN THAT YOU

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:15.984
KNOW WHAT THE HYDROLOGY- WE SEE

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:17.919
IN THE STATE. AT THIS YEAR WAS

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:19.521
AN EXAMPLE THOUGH WERE YOU KNOW

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.722
UNDER AN EXTREME DROUGHT

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:24.226
CONDITIONS- THERE COULD BE NO

01:19:24.292 --> 01:19:26.128
SOME TOP GAMES WHEN- WATER

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:29.498
AVAILABILITY BECOMES A FACTOR-

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:30.565
THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.601
IS RELATED TO THE EFFICIENCY OF

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:35.303
THE OF THE- UPON STORAGE VERSUS

01:19:35.370 --> 01:19:37.405
OTHER TYPE ENERGY STORAGE. I

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.174
THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF

01:19:39.241 --> 01:19:42.110
PUMPED STORAGE IS. THAT HE-

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:45.080
HYDROPOWER URBAN'S GENERATING

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.848
EFFICIENCY AT LAKE OR A BILL IS

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.184
ON THE ORDER OF NINETY FIVE

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:50.552
PERCENT. AND THEN ARE PUMPING

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.021
EFFICIENCY BACK INTO THE LAKE IS

01:19:53.088 --> 01:19:55.957
ON THE ORDER OF 8290% SO THE

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.859
OVERALL ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:02.030
STORING- SOLAR ENERGY. AS YOU

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:03.398
KNOW IN THE LAKE OR BILL'S THE

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.066
BATTERY IS PRETTY HIGH- IN

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:07.302
COMPARISON TO OTHER TECHNOLOGY.

01:20:07.369 --> 01:20:09.304
SO THE CHORE AS MY AND MY

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.740
CORRECT SUGGEST THAT IF YOU USE

01:20:11.806 --> 01:20:14.709
A- A HUNDRED MAKE UP A HUNDRED

01:20:14.776 --> 01:20:16.444
MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY- PRODUCE

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:19.047
ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE- WITH THE

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:21.483
SYSTEM. THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT A

01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:30.192
15% DROP OFFICE IS THAT CORRECT. WITH WITH THE HYDRO. THAT'S A

01:20:30.258 --> 01:20:33.295
VERY. FAIRLY GOOD AS- GEN- I CAN

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:37.065
AT. IT YES. ANSWER TWO YEARS-

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:39.768
AFTER THIS- HEARING IF THAT'S IN

01:20:39.834 --> 01:20:40.602
AND YOU MAY THIS YEAR THERE'S

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.304
NOT ENOUGH WILL. YOU KNOW WE

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:43.772
TALK ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL IN

01:20:43.838 --> 01:20:45.340
ADDITION BEING A DROUGHT THERE

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:47.175
RATHER IN A- OF VERY ASIAN. AND

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:48.543

ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. DO

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.314
WE HAVE IT HAVE THERE BEEN ANY

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.049
OTHER YEARS AND IN THE LAST

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:56.151
TWENTY YEARS WHEN ORVILLE WAS

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:59.688
TOO LOW TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:01.256
ELECTRICITY IT AT ANY TIME. THIS

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.858
THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:06.194

DEPLOYMENT OF AT LEAST ONE OF

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:35.630
THESE GENERATORS- WAS IN A

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.932
COMMUNITY WITH SIGNIFICANT AIR

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:41.636
QUALITY ISSUES ALREADY- IS THERE

01:25:41.703 --> 01:25:45.173
SOMEWHERE ELSE WERE- THEY COULD

THE CAROLINAS SO TO IDENTIFY ALL

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:02.991
POTENTIAL SITES AROUND THE STATE

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:04.859
OF CALIFORNIA THAT WENT THROUGH

01:26:04.926 --> 01:26:07.662
A- TWO TIERED APPROACH TO LOOK

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:09.931
FOR THE YOU KNOW MOST SUITABLE

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:11.933
SITE AND- ENVIRONMENTAL

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.968
SENSITIVITY AREAS WERE TAKEN

01:26:14.035 --> 01:26:15.703
INTO- INTO ACCOUNT

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.639
UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.641
NOT A THEY WERE NOT A LOT OF

01:26:19.707 --> 01:26:22.110
SITES THAT WERE READILY

01:26:22.176 --> 01:26:23.478
AVAILABLE TO BE- CONSTRAINED

01:26:23.545 --> 01:26:25.413
AIRED AND YELL THE PROCUREMENTS

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.515
AND CONSTRUCTED BY THE FALL. AND

01:26:27.582 --> 01:26:29.617
SO THE LIST REALLY DWINDLED DOWN

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.753
TO ABOUT FORTY SITES THAT. WE

01:26:31.819 --> 01:26:33.922
WERE WE REALLY PASSED THE FIRST

01:26:33.988 --> 01:26:35.924
LEVEL OF TEAR SCREENING WHEN WE

01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:37.892
GOT TO THE SECOND TIER SCREENING

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:40.128
WHICH REALLY THEN LOOK THAT. AS

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:41.829
WELL AS ALL THE EQUIPMENT TO

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.298
READ TO INTERCONNECT TO THE GRID

WHEN REALLY IN THAT NARROW THAT

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:57.612
DOWN ONLY TWO SITES. REALLY MET

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:00.815
THE CRITERIA TO BE ABLE TO YOU

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.617
KNOW- CONSTRUCT THESE GENERATORS

KNOW THAT WHAT THE WHAT THE NEXT

01:27:44.325 --> 01:27:47.495
STEPS ARE FOR THE GENERATORS TO

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:51.432
SUPPORT GRID. RELIABILITY. THANK

01:27:51.499 --> 01:27:53.234
YOU- ARE THERE ANY OTHER

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:59.073
QUESTIONS. MISTER. TEN THANK

01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:02.176
YOU- JUST JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.278
SETTLED ON NATURAL GAS VERSUS

01:28:04.345 --> 01:28:06.280
LOOKING AT OTHER- ENERGY SOURCES

01:28:06.347 --> 01:28:07.615
ESPECIALLY AS THE CHAIR HAD

01:28:07.682 --> 01:28:09.350
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING ONE OF

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:11.619
THE MOST POLLUTED AREAS OF THE

01:28:11.686 --> 01:28:14.188
STATE AND OBVIOUSLY PROBABLY

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:17.158
FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT. YOU

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.594
KNOW WHEN THE TEAM OF THE W. ARE

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:20.662
IN C. C. IN THE COLLEGE SO

01:28:20.728 --> 01:28:22.764
LOOKED AT YOU KNOW HOW WHAT WAS

01:28:22.830 --> 01:28:24.666
THE FASTEST WAY TO GET EMERGENCY

01:28:24.732 --> 01:28:26.634
GENERATORS ONLINE PORTABLE

01:28:26.701 --> 01:28:29.470
GENERATORS WERE. REALLY THE ONLY

01:28:29.537 --> 01:28:31.739
OPTION AVAILABLE AND REALLY

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:34.642
NATURAL GAS AND- DIESEL WERE THE

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:36.678
TWO FEELS THAT THESE PORTABLE

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.379
GENERATORS RUNS FROM OF. COURSE

01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:43.251
WE OPTED IN. THE STATE OPTED FOR

01:28:43.317 --> 01:28:44.752
NATURAL GAS. THE CALLOUS- ALSO

01:28:44.819 --> 01:28:47.021
LOOK THAT. IF NO OTHER PROJECTS

01:28:47.088 --> 01:28:49.390
THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:50.992
FOR BATTERY STORAGE OR ANY

01:28:51.059 --> 01:28:53.194
OTHER. CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES BUT

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:55.263
NONE OF THEM COULD BE EXPEDITED

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:57.432
TO GET ONLINE- BY THAT FALL SO

01:28:57.498 --> 01:28:59.500
THE DECISION WAS THAT THIS WAS

01:28:59.567 --> 01:29:02.537
THE CLEANEST- FORM OF POWER WE

01:29:02.603 --> 01:29:05.440
COULD GET. UNDER THE EMERGENCY

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:07.208
CONDITIONS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE.

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:09.277
GOT A TO JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.344
JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME

01:29:10.411 --> 01:29:13.715
FRAME WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY-

01:29:13.781 --> 01:29:14.348
THE TIME FRAME WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:29:14.415 --> 01:29:17.952
IF WE DECIDE TO GO WITH BATTERY

01:29:18.019 --> 01:29:19.954
STORAGE. YEAH I CAN'T REALLY

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.123
EXPRESS AND PROBABLY MORE OF A-

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.125
TO EASIER CALLOUS SO QUESTION

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:24.759
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES REALLY

01:29:24.826 --> 01:29:27.195
MANAGING THE QUEUE. I'M NOT SURE

01:29:27.261 --> 01:29:29.063
WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FOR

01:29:29.130 --> 01:29:30.732
YOU OKAY WHAT WE HAVE CC HERE SO

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:32.934
C. C. CAN YOU ANSWER THAT

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:41.175
QUESTION. THE AVERAGE MODESTO

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:44.078
HERE IT. CAN YOU REPEAT THE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:45.246
QUESTION. YEAH THE QUESTION TO

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.714
THE QUESTION WAS- MISTER LEDESMA

01:29:46.781 --> 01:29:48.716
TALKED ABOUT HOW. AFTER

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:51.119
EVALUATING A VARIETY OF ENERGY

01:29:51.185 --> 01:29:53.621
CHOICES THAT THAT NATURAL GAS

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:54.222
PORTABLE GENERATORS WAS

01:29:54.288 --> 01:29:57.091
CONSIDERED THE- THE FASTEST AND

01:29:57.158 --> 01:29:58.860
THE QUICKEST- BETWEEN THAT IN

01:29:58.926 --> 01:29:59.994
DIESEL I GUESS THAT THE CHOICE

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:02.029
WAS. MADE BETWEEN NATURAL GAS

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.499
AND DIESEL MY QUESTION WAS. HOW

01:30:04.565 --> 01:30:06.501
BIG A TIME DIFFERENCE WOULD HAVE

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:08.402
BEEN IF WE HAD GONE WITH. A

01:30:08.469 --> 01:30:11.339
CLEANER ENERGY LIKE BATTERIES

01:30:11.405 --> 01:30:16.644
LIKE SOLAR BATTERY STORAGE. HEY

01:30:16.711 --> 01:30:18.312
THIS IS FOR THIS IS THE LEAST I

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.214
COULD HEAR THEM FROM THE

01:30:20.281 --> 01:30:22.550
ASSESSMENTS DIVISION- I AM

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:26.954
HOPING THAT- WE HAVE. SOMEONE

01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:29.957
FROM OUR CITING DIVISION ON TO

01:30:30.024 --> 01:30:45.673
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION BURKE

01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.475
LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET AN

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.677
ANSWER FOR THAT- AND IF WE CAN

01:30:49.744 --> 01:30:51.879
CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING AND- I

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.981
WILL CHIME IN. THAT THAT THAT'S

01:30:54.048 --> 01:30:55.817
GREATER THAN I GUESS THIS IS

01:30:55.883 --> 01:30:57.385
JUST A FOLLOW UP AS WELL WHEN IT

01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.653
HONESTLY WHEN WIND WAS WHAT DID

01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:01.756
YOU FIRST START LOOKING AT-

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:05.393
THESE RESOURCES- YES. WELL THE-

01:31:05.459 --> 01:31:07.695
WAS MADE JULY THIRTIETH SO. YOU

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.397
KNOW EARLY AUGUST AND MAYBE IN

01:31:09.463 --> 01:31:12.033
THE DAYS AFTER THAT IS WHEN THE

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:14.902
DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S EASY IN THE

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:17.071
CAROLINAS SO STARTED LOOKING

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:19.740
FOR. SITES THAT COULD BE A- THE

01:31:19.807 --> 01:31:22.109
BILL SOME STARTED USING EARLY

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:23.778
AUGUST- TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:31:23.845 --> 01:31:25.346
CORRECT OKAY AND ART ARE

01:31:25.413 --> 01:31:27.715
DEADLINE WAS- AS THE ORDER SAID

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:28.382
WHEN THEY NEEDED TO BE

01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:31.886
OPERATIONAL PRIOR TO OCTOBER

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.287
THIRTY FIRST SO FROM A

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:35.356
CONSTRUCTIVE BILITY. THAT IS

01:31:35.423 --> 01:31:38.125
REALLY FAST TIME FRAME BLESS YOU

01:31:38.192 --> 01:31:40.328
. AND THESE GENERATORS WERE

01:31:40.394 --> 01:31:43.531
ACTUALLY STEPPED UP AND-

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.433
COMMISSIONED IN FIFTY ONE DAYS

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:48.803
WHICH IS. IN MY IN MY OPINION-

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:50.638
RECORD TIME YEAH NOT NOT FLAT

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:52.106
AFTER A BRIGHT FREESHEET THE

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:55.076
EFFORTS TO WIN TO REALLY GET

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.778
THESE- TURK TURBINES I THINK THE

01:31:57.845 --> 01:32:01.382
QUESTION IS THAT. FROM YOU KNOW

01:32:01.449 --> 01:32:03.484
WE HAVE WE HAVE A STATE GOAL TO

01:32:03.551 --> 01:32:04.452
GO TOWARD A 100% RENEWABLE

01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:08.656
ENERGY STATE GOAL TO BE- MOVING

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:11.259
TOWARD CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY SO IT

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:13.094
JUST SEEMS THAT THE AGENCIES

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.429
THAT ARE REALLY IN CHARGE OF

01:32:15.496 --> 01:32:17.098
CREATING THE LEADERSHIP- TOWARDS

01:32:17.164 --> 01:32:20.835
THAT GOAL- SOMEHOW. YOU KNOW IT

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.737
IGNORED IT AND DECIDED TO GO

01:32:22.803 --> 01:32:26.641
WITH A- DIRTIER SOURCE AT A TIME

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.943
WHEN THESE COMMUNITIES OBVIOUSLY

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.811
NEED THE ENERGY BUT ALSO AT A

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.146
TIME WHEN THE THESE COMMUNITIES

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.814
NEED IN ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:36.817
SO THEY SEEM TO BE ON THE FORTY

01:32:36.884 --> 01:32:37.952
EIGHT THE AGENCIES WERE TRUSTING

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:40.154
TO CLEAN. THE AIR AND CLEAN THE

01:32:40.221 --> 01:32:44.492
ENERGY- SEEM TO IGNORE IT WHEN

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.527
IT WAS CONVENIENT UNFORTUNATELY

01:32:46.594 --> 01:32:48.930
. SEARCH TO DO WE HAVE OF. THE

01:32:48.996 --> 01:32:53.834
PROPER CC PERSONAL. I KNOW

01:32:53.901 --> 01:32:56.737
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR- SEAN PETARD

01:32:56.804 --> 01:33:10.284
. AS MR PETARD AVAILABLE.

01:33:10.351 --> 01:33:11.552
GOOD MORNING THIS IS DAMON NOT

01:33:11.619 --> 01:33:12.753
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT DOESN'T

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:15.056
APPEAR THAT SEAN IS ON THE LINE-

01:33:15.122 --> 01:33:16.657
BUT WE WILL WORK WITH ENERGY

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:17.992
COMMISSION COLLEAGUES TO GET

01:33:18.059 --> 01:33:21.495
BACK TO YOU ON THAT ANSWER.

01:33:21.562 --> 01:33:23.097
THANK YOU KNOW LIKE THIS IS

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.932
BECAUSE FROM THE PC I CAN'T

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:26.434
ANSWER SPECIFICALLY TO THIS

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:29.136
EFFORT BUT ANECDOTALLY. IN THE-

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:31.906
PC DIRECTED UTILITY- THE I USED

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:34.675
TO. DO AS MUCH PROCUREMENT UNDER

01:33:34.742 --> 01:33:36.377
ARMOR AGENCY PROCUREMENT-

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.045
PROCEEDINGS AS POSSIBLE FOR THE

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:39.380
SAME PERIOD OF TIME STARTING

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:44.151
QUITE A BIT EARLIER. AND THEY

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.419
ARE THEY WERE REALLY. THEY WERE

01:33:45.486 --> 01:33:47.088
DOING THEIR LEVEL IDEA. ANY

01:33:47.154 --> 01:33:48.789
STATESIDE BATTERIES WOULD BE

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.458
AVAILABLE AND DEPLOYED ON A FAST

01:33:50.524 --> 01:33:53.561
TURNAROUND. I DON'T THINK IT AND

01:33:53.627 --> 01:33:54.862
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO- BUT

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:56.897
WITH A LOT MORE LEAD TIME AND I

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.332
DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE

01:33:58.399 --> 01:33:59.834
BEEN. THAT YOU KNOW POSSIBLE

01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.302
THEY WOULD OF A POSSIBLE FOR

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:02.603
THEM TO TURN THAT REQUEST AROUND

01:34:02.670 --> 01:34:05.773
IN TWO MONTHS AND- AT THAT POINT

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.675
IN TIME BY JULY- EITHER YOU ARE

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:12.513
WITH THE COMPETING. WITH.

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.682
PROJECTS ALREADY BEING- PLACE

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:15.816
THE ELUSIVE THE SAME TIME SO I

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:19.053
CAN JUST SAY. I'M TRY TO I DON'T

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.055
BELIEVE. I FROM PERSPECTIVE THAT

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:23.057
THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET

01:34:23.124 --> 01:34:23.991
BETTER. ADDITIONAL BATTERIES

01:34:24.058 --> 01:34:25.659
WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DEPLOYING.

01:34:25.726 --> 01:34:28.896
ARE LOCATED AND PUT IT SERVICE

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.631
WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO AT THAT

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:31.999
POINT IT'S- GONNA THANK YOU

01:34:32.066 --> 01:34:33.601
SUGGEST BUT JUST GO BACK TO THE

01:34:33.667 --> 01:34:35.503
QC. BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE

01:34:35.569 --> 01:34:37.238
PROCUREMENT DIRECTIVE IS TO

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:41.475
PRIORITIZE CLEAN ENERGY. OVER

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:42.977
DIRTY ENERGY IS THAT CORRECT.

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:45.746
YES WE YOU KNOW WE APPLIED A

01:34:45.813 --> 01:34:47.248
SORT OF LOADING ORDER. TO THE

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:49.417
DIRECTION WE GAVE WITHIN THE-

01:34:49.483 --> 01:34:51.152
EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT PROCEEDING

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:54.355
TO GO AFTER. YOU KNOW BATTERIES-

01:34:54.422 --> 01:34:56.390
DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES LIKE

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.592
DEMAND RESPONSE AND ENERGY

01:34:58.659 --> 01:35:00.661
EFFICIENCY AND- A- VARIETY OF

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:02.530
OTHER RESOURCES AND THAT AND

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:04.698
THEN. YOU KNOW IT EFFICIENCY

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:06.834
IMPROVEMENTS AT AT POWER PLANTS

01:35:06.901 --> 01:35:09.336
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE. THE

01:35:09.403 --> 01:35:11.205
SAME OR MORE POWER FOR. MORE

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:12.907
POWER FOR THIS THE SAME OR LESS

01:35:12.973 --> 01:35:14.775
THAT. INCREMENTAL ENERGY SO

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:16.210
THAT'S GOT THE APPROACH WE TOOK.

01:35:16.277 --> 01:35:20.314
PERFECT SO IT'S NOT THINKING

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:21.515
I ADD A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION

01:35:21.582 --> 01:35:23.551
BECAUSE THE STATE I THINK DID

01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:25.319
TAKE A VERY PROACTIVE APPROACH.

01:35:25.386 --> 01:35:27.054
THESE GENERATORS PORTABLE

01:35:27.121 --> 01:35:28.823
GENERATORS TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE

01:35:28.889 --> 01:35:31.425
S. C. OURS. TO EAT YOU KNOW THEY

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:32.860
ARE VERY CLEAN GENERATORS THE

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.663
STATE INVESTED IN S. C. A. R.'S.

01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:37.398
WHICH IS AN UNTYPICAL FOR

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:40.101
PORTABLE GENERATORS TO MAKE SURE

01:35:40.167 --> 01:35:41.769
THAT WE WERE USING THE BEST. OF

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:43.337
THE BEST TECHNOLOGY FOR A

01:35:43.404 --> 01:35:45.272
MISSION CONTROLS AND THEN SECOND

01:35:45.339 --> 01:35:46.974
THESE GENERATORS WILL ONLY BE

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:49.543
OPERATED UNDER. CAROLINE STILL

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:53.581
EMERGED- EMERGENCY- ORDERS SO

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:55.616
THEY WILL NOT BE BUILT INTO THE

01:35:55.683 --> 01:35:56.517
MARKET SO THEY WILL NOT BE

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.452
RUNNING AS A MARKET YOU KNOW IS

01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:00.387
A TYPICAL. OF A GHASTLY

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:03.124
GENERATOR SO WILL ONLY BE USED

01:36:03.190 --> 01:36:05.326
FOR GOES. UP EXTREME CASES

01:36:05.392 --> 01:36:06.827
RUBBER BULLET AND I SHOULD

01:36:06.894 --> 01:36:15.903
ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY NUMBER. THE

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.571
LIST OF HEARING SO. OKAY

01:44:17.384 --> 01:44:20.487
WARMING RAINS NOT COMING WE'RE

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:22.556
NOT STORING WATER CALIFORNIA.

01:44:22.623 --> 01:44:24.558
BUT WE'RE TEARING DOWN DAMS THAT

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.627
ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO PRODUCE

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:28.895
CLEAN ENERGY IN THIS STATE AND I

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:30.631
CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ONE

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:32.132
GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN'T WORK

01:44:32.199 --> 01:44:33.800
WITH ANOTHER ANOTHER IN THE

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:37.771
ADMINISTRATION BEING FORTHRIGHT

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:41.074
WITH THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:41.908
. WHY COULDN'T THIS MONEY BE

01:44:41.975 --> 01:44:44.978
SPENT A LONG TIME AGO NOT IN AN

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:47.981
EMERGENCY. FOR THE OF RENEWABLE

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:50.651
ENERGY OF BIOMASS POWER PLANTS

01:44:50.717 --> 01:44:52.753
IN MORE HYDRO ELECTRICITY IN THE

01:44:52.819 --> 01:44:55.589
STATE. MAYBE YOU CAN GET BACK

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:57.257
WITH SOME ANSWERS ON THAT FOR ME

01:44:57.324 --> 01:44:59.059
SO I WOULD KNOW WHAT GOVERNMENT

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:00.627
AGENCY ISN'T TALKING TO EACH

01:45:00.694 --> 01:45:02.929
OTHER OR WORKING WEEKLY WITH

01:45:02.996 --> 01:45:04.831
EACH OTHER. AND THAT'S THE

01:45:04.898 --> 01:45:06.733
PUBLIC'S MONEY THAT YOU ARE

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:09.603
PRETTY MUCH WASTED BECAUSE WE

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:11.805
CREATE. AN EMERGENCY. WHEN WE

01:45:11.872 --> 01:45:14.174
DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:20.781
IN THE STATE. MISTER PATTERSON.

01:45:20.847 --> 01:45:22.916
I'M MEMBERS I'VE SPENT NINE

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:27.654
YEARS- GOING ON TEN YEARS AS

01:45:27.721 --> 01:45:29.423
THE- VICE CHAIR OF UTILITY. AND

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:34.661
ENERGY. BOB I THINK WE NEED TO

01:45:34.728 --> 01:45:36.730
UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THAT

01:45:36.797 --> 01:45:37.931
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:40.500
RIGHT NOW. AND THE PREDICAMENT

01:45:40.567 --> 01:45:45.772
IS THAT. WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY.

01:45:45.839 --> 01:45:48.041
DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:51.011
IMMORAL ELECTRONS AND MORAL

01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:54.081
ELECTRONS. AND WE'RE MAKING A

01:45:54.147 --> 01:45:56.550
VERY VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO

01:45:56.616 --> 01:46:00.287
USE THE IMMORAL ELECTRONS.

01:46:00.353 --> 01:46:02.989
NATURAL GAS IT'S AFTER. AND YET

01:46:03.056 --> 01:46:04.825
IT IS THOSE VERY IMMORAL

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.927
ELECTRONS THAT ARE KEEPING OUR

01:46:06.993 --> 01:46:11.264
LIGHTS ON. WE HAVE HAD IN THESE.

01:46:11.331 --> 01:46:13.800
EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.203
HAD BECAUSE THE WIND DOESN'T

01:46:16.269 --> 01:46:17.337
ALWAYS BLOW THE SUN DOESN'T

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:19.973
ALWAYS SHINE. ACKERLEY AT TIMES

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:23.009
WHEN WE NEED A RELIABLE ENERGY

01:46:23.076 --> 01:46:26.246
WE GET- INTERMITTENT ENERGY. AND

01:46:26.313 --> 01:46:28.515
THERE ARE IN FACT ELECTRONS THAT

01:46:28.582 --> 01:46:32.385
WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE A MORAL

01:46:32.452 --> 01:46:33.487
. THEY'RE QUITE FRANKLY TO KEEP

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.789
THE LIGHTS ON. AND SO I THINK

01:46:35.856 --> 01:46:39.092
IT'S RATHER DISINGENUOUS FOR US

01:46:39.159 --> 01:46:41.795
TO. JOINT FINGERS AT THE

01:46:41.862 --> 01:46:45.499
ADMINISTRATION OR AT THE THESE

01:46:45.565 --> 01:46:47.901
PEOPLE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.870
CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF THEM.

01:46:49.936 --> 01:46:52.739
INCREASING DEMAND AT A TIME WHEN

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:55.575
WE ARE DECOMMISSIONING

01:46:55.642 --> 01:46:58.945
SIGNIFICANT ENERGY AT TIMES WHEN

01:46:59.012 --> 01:47:02.849
WE NEEDED. AND WHAT YOU THINK

01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:04.785
ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WE ARE

01:47:04.851 --> 01:47:05.919
INCREASINGLY SEEING AN

01:47:05.986 --> 01:47:08.789
UNRELIABLE GRID. AND WE ARE SO

01:47:08.855 --> 01:47:12.058
INCREASINGLY SAYING A HUGE SPIKE

01:47:12.125 --> 01:47:13.994
IN THE COST OF ELECTRICITY TO

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.062
THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT.

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:19.332
AND I THINK THAT- IT IT IS A-

01:47:19.399 --> 01:47:24.037
RELATIVELY FOOLISH AARON I TO

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:27.407
TRY TO LEGISLATE THAT YOU KNOW

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:30.310
BUT AGAINST THE PHYSICS OF THE

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:33.079
MOVEMENT OF ELECTRONS. AND THE

01:47:33.146 --> 01:47:34.314
REALITY IS THAT WE KEEP THE

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:36.283
LIGHTS ON BY USING THESE NATURAL

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:39.486
GAS PLANTS BY IMPORTING

01:47:39.553 --> 01:47:41.154
ELECTRICITY ACROSS OTHER STATE

01:47:41.221 --> 01:47:43.256
LINES AT THE TIMES THAT. WE

01:47:43.323 --> 01:47:46.426
NEEDED. SO ON THE ONE HAND WE

01:47:46.493 --> 01:47:51.832
HAVE THIS- NO NOTION OF- THAT

01:47:51.898 --> 01:47:54.234
PERFECT IN MORAL ELECTRICITY.

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:56.002
WHAT IMPACT THE PEOPLE OF

01:47:56.069 --> 01:47:56.703
CALIFORNIA ARE SUFFERING RIGHT

01:47:56.770 --> 01:48:00.941
NOW THROUGH THE LACK OF THE KIND

01:48:01.007 --> 01:48:03.844
OF ELECTRICITY THAT WE HAVE

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:06.179
BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO. I THINK

01:48:06.246 --> 01:48:08.381
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO BE ABLE

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:12.018
TO GO TO THE- POWER GRID. TURN

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:14.721
THE LIGHTS ON AND AGAIN TO THE

01:48:14.788 --> 01:48:17.490
ELECTRICITY AND FIND IT

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:20.594
AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. AND

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.097
YET IN MY DISTRICT. THE STATE OF

01:48:24.164 --> 01:48:29.135
CALIFORNIA IS ADVERTISING THAT

01:48:29.202 --> 01:48:31.137
IN ORDER TO SAVE CALIFORNIA AND

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:34.341
KEEP IT GREEN. THAT WE HAVE TO

01:48:34.407 --> 01:48:35.642
DECIDE NOT TO USE OUR

01:48:35.709 --> 01:48:37.177
ELECTRICITY BETWEEN FOUR O'CLOCK

01:48:37.244 --> 01:48:41.014
AND NINE O'CLOCK. PM TO REALIZE

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:44.117
WHAT KIND OF. CHALLENGE THAT

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:47.420
PRESENTS TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.521
NORMAL ORDINARY NINE TO FIVE

01:48:48.588 --> 01:48:51.825
LIVES. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A WE'VE

01:48:51.892 --> 01:48:52.859
AGREED THAT WE'RE BASICALLY

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:55.662
SAYING ISN'T AVAILABLE OR

01:48:55.729 --> 01:48:59.933
USEABLE. BUT BECAUSE THE

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:00.867
ELECTRICITY ISN'T AVAILABLE

01:49:00.934 --> 01:49:03.970
THERE. AND SO THE OVER RELIANCE

01:49:04.037 --> 01:49:08.141
ON THE- MORAL ELECTRONS AND THE

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.277
SHEDDING OF THESE IMMORAL

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:12.846
ELECTRONS. HAVE CREATED A

01:49:12.913 --> 01:49:14.948
CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH IN MY

01:49:15.015 --> 01:49:16.950
DISTRICT RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE ARE

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:20.020
RECEIVING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:24.724
DOLLAR PG&amp;E BILLS. I MY DISTRICT

01:49:24.791 --> 01:49:27.427
IS BEING- INUNDATED WITH PEOPLE

01:49:27.494 --> 01:49:29.562
WHO ARE CALLING MY OFFICE AND

01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:30.830
SAID WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:35.769
HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE.

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:39.806
THE OBVIOUS HERE. THAT IF WE ARE

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:45.312
SO. INTENT ON STRIPPING

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:47.147
CALIFORNIA FROM THESE IMMORAL

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:50.517
ELECTRONS. WE HAVE A CONSEQUENCE

01:49:50.583 --> 01:49:53.553
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CREATING REAL

01:49:53.620 --> 01:49:56.356
DIFFICULTIES FOR THE BACK VERY

01:49:56.423 --> 01:50:01.127
PEOPLE WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT. AB

01:50:01.194 --> 01:50:04.064
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- WE HAVE

01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:05.932
SOMETHING LIKE IT I THINK IT WAS

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:07.300
LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND.

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:11.071
ELECTRICITY ACCOUNTS- THAT WERE

01:50:11.137 --> 01:50:11.604
TERMINATED BECAUSE PEOPLE

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:13.773
COULDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS THAT'S

01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.941
NOT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:16.943
INDIVIDUALS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:18.645
THOUSAND ACCOUNTS THERE MIGHT BE

01:50:18.712 --> 01:50:21.247
THREE FOUR FIVE SIX PEOPLE. WE

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:22.649
ARE CREATING ELECTRICITY

01:50:22.716 --> 01:50:27.520
SCARCITY. AND WE ARE CREATING

01:50:27.587 --> 01:50:31.257
ELECTRICITY THAT IS INCREASINGLY

01:50:31.324 --> 01:50:35.061
UNRELIABLE AND WE ARE ASKING OUR

01:50:35.128 --> 01:50:37.230
CONSTITUENTS BETWEEN FOUR

01:50:37.297 --> 01:50:39.766
O'CLOCK AND NINE O'CLOCK TO STOP

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:42.635
LIVING THE KIND OF LIFE THAT

01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:45.005
THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO. AS

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:47.407
I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT.

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:50.510
AND REYES THE OBVIOUS OF. THE

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:54.280
INTENTIONS MAY BE NOBLE. BUT THE

01:50:54.347 --> 01:50:56.649
EFFECT IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO

01:50:56.716 --> 01:50:58.685
THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE AND

01:50:58.752 --> 01:51:01.054
THAT'S THE KIND OF FRUSTRATION

01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:02.022
AND DIFFICULTIES THAT ARE ENERGY

01:51:02.088 --> 01:51:04.858
PEOPLE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.893
HAVE TO FACE. THERE'S A REASON

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.995
THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:11.164
. THEY REACHING TWO ELECTRONS

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:13.099
THAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:15.035
AVAILABLE AT A TIME THAT WE NEED

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:17.904
TO. AND I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:18.772
RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE

01:51:18.838 --> 01:51:21.174
DILEMMA- THAT WE ARE CREATING BY

01:51:21.241 --> 01:51:23.543
THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE ARE

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:26.613
PURSUING. AND WHEN WE RELY ON

01:51:26.679 --> 01:51:30.216
THE IMPORTATION. OF ELECTRICITY

01:51:30.283 --> 01:51:33.053
FROM FROM OTHER STATES. IN A AYE

01:51:33.119 --> 01:51:34.421
AYE POSITIONS THEY SAY WHAT ARE

01:51:34.487 --> 01:51:36.790
WE GONNA DO STRIP SEARCH THOSE

01:51:36.856 --> 01:51:38.124
ELECTRONS AT THE BORDER. TO MAKE

01:51:38.191 --> 01:51:40.794
SURE THAT THEY ARE MORAL OR

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.396
IMMORAL- WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.532
THAT OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE

01:51:45.598 --> 01:51:47.600
RELIABLE AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY.

01:51:47.667 --> 01:51:49.035
TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WHEN

01:51:49.102 --> 01:51:50.570
THEY NEEDED REGARDLESS OF THE

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:53.039
TIME OF DAY AND I THINK WE'RE

01:51:53.106 --> 01:51:56.309
MISSING THAT MARK. THANK YOU- I

01:51:56.376 --> 01:51:57.677
THINK WE'VE GOTTEN THAT PRETTY

01:51:57.744 --> 01:51:59.245
FAR AFIELD FROM THE CORE

01:51:59.312 --> 01:52:01.548
QUESTION HERE- THAT THE CHAIR

01:52:01.614 --> 01:52:03.616
WAS ASKING WHICH IS- WHERE'S THE

01:52:03.683 --> 01:52:05.685
UNDERLYING INFORMATION-

01:52:05.752 --> 01:52:07.987
REGARDING- A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT-

01:52:08.054 --> 01:52:09.989
BUDGET REQUEST- THAT IS THE

01:52:10.056 --> 01:52:13.026
TOPIC. OF THIS HEARING AS FOR

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:16.062
THE SUBJECT OF- LIKE TRENDS AND

01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:18.398
YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE CAN WE

01:52:18.465 --> 01:52:20.467
CAN- OF MOVE THIS INTO A DEBATE

01:52:20.533 --> 01:52:22.769
ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT THE

01:52:22.836 --> 01:52:24.370
REASON WE TALK ABOUT CLEAN

01:52:24.437 --> 01:52:27.407
ENERGY THEM THE REASON- WE ARE

01:52:27.474 --> 01:52:30.009
MOVING. AS QUICKLY AND AS

01:52:30.076 --> 01:52:32.612
EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE- A

01:52:32.679 --> 01:52:34.848
TOWARDS CLEAN ENERGY IS THAT WE

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:37.784
ARE. EXPERIENCING THE CLIMATE

01:52:37.851 --> 01:52:39.986
CRISIS IN REAL TIME WITH

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:42.555
WILDFIRE WITH EXTREME HEAT WITH-

01:52:42.622 --> 01:52:44.624
OF THE MANY OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT

01:52:44.691 --> 01:52:47.293
WE SEE OF A CHANGING CLIMATE

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:50.997
THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO A IN

01:52:51.064 --> 01:52:53.333
MANY WAYS TO THE PRODUCTION. AND

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:57.637
THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY FROM-

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:01.407
OF- CARBON HEAVY SOURCES WE

01:53:01.474 --> 01:53:03.309
COULD THE UP MOVE BACK TO COAL

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:05.812
FIRED THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY

01:53:05.879 --> 01:53:09.482
IF WE WANTED TO- BUT THAT WOULD

01:53:09.549 --> 01:53:13.353
PROVE TO ONLY. HASTEN THE OF

01:53:13.419 --> 01:53:15.655
VERY MANY SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE.

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:17.757
OTHER OF A RELATE TO THE CLIMATE

01:53:17.824 --> 01:53:20.627
CRISIS SET UP MR BENNETT LET'S

01:53:20.693 --> 01:53:22.495
TRY TO STAY ON THE TOPIC HERE

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:23.796
AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A QUESTION

01:53:23.863 --> 01:53:27.066
THAT RELATES TO- OUR EARLIER

THE- TOPIC OF ENERGY AND THE

01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:16.916
FUNDAMENTAL ONE THAT I THINK IS-

01:54:28.861 --> 01:54:33.132
FROM- CARBON HEAVY ENERGY TO

01:54:33.199 --> 01:54:35.735
CLEAN ENERGY- THERE WILL BE

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:38.071
DISLOCATIONS. AND THAT JUST

01:54:38.137 --> 01:54:39.272
INEVITABLE THAT HAPPENS

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.358
WHEN THERE IS ELECTRICITY-

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:00.326
SHORTAGE FOR SOME REASON WHEN

STEP BACK WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING

TO DO IS TO MODIFY EXISTING

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:43.909
AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:47.179

RISK BASED METHODOLOGY AND

02:04:51.684 --> 02:04:52.852
SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL

02:04:52.918 --> 02:04:54.753
REQUEST AMENDMENTS TO PUBLIC

02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:57.256
UTILITIES CODE SECTIONS THREE

ONE FOUR POINT FIVE. SEVEN NINE

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:01.994
TWO POINT FIVE AND TWO SEVEN

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.495
FOUR THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH AUDIT

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:05.164
AND INDUSTRY CURRENT BEST

02:05:05.231 --> 02:05:07.533
PRACTICES WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT

02:05:07.600 --> 02:05:09.368
THIS WOULD MAKE IT OUR OFFICE

02:05:09.435 --> 02:05:14.073
MORE. IMPACTFUL FOR RATEPAYERS.

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:16.208
CHANGES WOULD INTO A BASED MY-

02:05:16.275 --> 02:05:17.643
TO ALL OF THE AUDITS THAT WERE

02:05:17.710 --> 02:05:19.778
REQUIRED TO PERFORM. FOR THESE

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:22.181
REGULATED INDUSTRIES AND JUST TO

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.649
PROVIDE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW IT

02:05:23.716 --> 02:05:26.919
WOULD PLAY OUT- IF GRANTED THIS-

02:05:26.986 --> 02:05:28.888
PROPOSAL EVERY YEAR WE WOULD

02:05:28.954 --> 02:05:31.290
EXAMINE ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT

02:05:31.357 --> 02:05:33.225
WE COULD AUDITS. IDENTIFY AND

02:05:33.292 --> 02:05:35.261
RISKS AND THOSE THAT

02:05:35.327 --> 02:05:36.795
IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS WOULD

02:05:36.862 --> 02:05:38.731
HELP US CREATE AN ANNUAL AUDIT

02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:41.567
PLAN. AND EVALUATE THE RISK

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:44.069
ACCORDING TO THE REAL TIME

02:05:44.136 --> 02:05:46.705
EVENTS IN EACH INDUSTRY. SO FOR

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:49.942
EXAMPLE. AS YOU PARTY NOTED AS

02:05:50.009 --> 02:05:50.776
YOUR MEMBERS THE PARTY NOTED

02:05:50.843 --> 02:05:53.846
TODAY. BUT INDUSTRY FACING

02:05:53.913 --> 02:05:55.681
SIGNIFICANT IT GREAT INCREASES

02:05:55.748 --> 02:05:58.117
THAT IN AND OF ITSELF COULD BE A

02:05:58.183 --> 02:06:00.286
RISK THAT PLAYS INTO OUR- RISK

02:06:00.352 --> 02:06:02.655
ASSESSMENTS AND THUS OUR AUDIT

02:06:02.721 --> 02:06:04.924
PLAN IN OUR DECISION ABOUT WHICH

02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:06.792
ENTITIES TO AUDIT. OTHER

02:06:06.859 --> 02:06:08.627
EXAMPLES OF RISKS THAT WE MIGHT

02:06:08.694 --> 02:06:11.063
THINK ABOUT WOULD BE THE OVERALL

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:13.599
REVENUE BALANCE OF AN ENTITY SO

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:16.068
A SIZE LARGER REVENUE BALANCES

02:06:16.135 --> 02:06:17.603
WOULD LEND ITSELF TO MORE

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:19.104
INTEREST FROM AN AUDITING

02:06:19.171 --> 02:06:21.640
PERSPECTIVE. THE LENGTH OF TIME

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:23.575
SINCE AN ENTITY ENTITY WAS LAST

02:06:23.642 --> 02:06:25.978
AUDITED. AND THEN WHETHER OUR

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:27.813
AUDITS AUDITORS OR ANOTHER

02:06:27.880 --> 02:06:33.419
ENTITY HAVE FOUND. ANY ISSUES IN

02:06:33.485 --> 02:06:35.187
PASSED AUDITS. NOW WHAT WOULD

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:37.089
NOT CHANGE UNDER THIS. ARE THOSE

02:06:37.156 --> 02:06:38.524
THAT WE FALL. OUR AUDIT DIVISION

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:40.459
PERFORMS EVERY AUDIT ACCORDING

02:06:40.526 --> 02:06:41.961
TO GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS

02:06:42.027 --> 02:06:43.529
AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO

02:06:43.595 --> 02:06:45.531
THAT PRACTICE. THIS IS ONLY

02:06:45.597 --> 02:06:47.399
ABOUT CHANGING HOW WE DECIDE

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:49.601
WHICH ENTITIES TO AUDIT ON AN

02:06:49.668 --> 02:06:52.371
ANNUAL BASIS. WITH THIS CHANGE I

02:06:52.438 --> 02:06:54.306
WOULD HAVE BETTER ABILITY TO

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.442
DIRECT OUR AUDITING DIVISION

02:06:56.508 --> 02:06:58.510
TOWARD HIGHER RISK ENTITIES. WE

02:06:58.577 --> 02:07:00.212
WOULD HAVE BETTER ABILITY TO

02:07:00.279 --> 02:07:02.247
RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO EVENTS

02:07:02.314 --> 02:07:04.516
AND ULTIMATELY DRIVE OUT THAT

02:07:04.583 --> 02:07:06.285
AUDITING VALUE THAT IS SO

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:08.287
IMPORTANT AND SO IMPACTFUL FOR

02:07:08.354 --> 02:07:10.589
REPAIRS. THERE'S A CLEANUP

02:07:10.656 --> 02:07:12.691
LANGUAGE IN THE- PROPOSAL AS

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:17.296
WELL- BUT THERE WAS MY REMARKS

02:07:17.363 --> 02:07:18.397
AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.232
QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:23.102
WE'RE NOT NOT A QUESTIONS YET-

02:07:23.168 --> 02:07:26.939
WILL I HEAR FROM THE ALEJO.

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:29.174
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- STOP ON

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:31.210
THIS ISSUE- IN CONCEPT WE

02:07:31.276 --> 02:07:32.811
SUPPORT THE OVERALL INTENT TO

02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:34.446
USE THE A RISK BASED APPROACH TO

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:36.448
AUDITING AS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY

02:07:36.515 --> 02:07:38.851
TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. HOWEVER

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:39.852
AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE

02:07:39.918 --> 02:07:41.420
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.955
MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROPOSAL

02:07:43.022 --> 02:07:45.424
INCLUDING. KEEPING REQUIREMENTS

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:47.259
FOR LARGE AUDITS OR A REGULAR

02:07:47.326 --> 02:07:49.461
AUDITS OF LARGE UTILITIES WITH

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:51.263
SUBSTANTIAL AUDIT FINDINGS WHILE

02:07:51.330 --> 02:07:52.698
ALSO PROVIDINGSOME FLEXIBILITY

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:54.800
MAY BE FOR LESS FREQUENT AUDITS

02:07:54.867 --> 02:07:55.334
OF THE SMALLER LESS RISKY

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:57.202
UTILITIES SO. SOMETHING LIKE

02:07:57.269 --> 02:07:59.371
THIS COULDSTRIKE A MORE- MORE

02:07:59.438 --> 02:08:00.773
OF A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN KIND

02:08:00.839 --> 02:08:02.141
OF PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:03.742
WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING SOME

02:08:03.809 --> 02:08:05.177
MINIMUM LEVEL OF REQUIREMENTS

02:08:05.244 --> 02:08:06.578
FOR THAT THE LARGER RISK.

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:08.614
UTILITIES SO THERE'S INTEREST BY

02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:09.615
THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:08:09.681 --> 02:08:11.650

INTRODUCED IN TWENTY NINETEEN.
