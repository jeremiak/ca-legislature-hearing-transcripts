00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.166
FRAUD.

THE PRACTICES OF THESE NETWORKS

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:02.734
HAVE GONE AS FAR AS TO PIT ONE

00:30:09.307 --> 00:30:10.308
UTILIZATION.

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:11.643
THESE ACTIVITIES OCCUR WITHOUT

INVOLVEMENT FROM THE EMPLOYER

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:14.879

AND THEN DISCOUNTS THAT PRICE TO

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:22.520
THE PROVIDER AND KEEPS THE

00:30:22.587 --> 00:30:24.422
REMAINING SAVINGS SUCH PRACTICES

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.191
DRIVE DOWN PRICING TO THE TO THE

DELAYED ACCESS TO CARE IS PROVEN

00:30:34.699 --> 00:30:36.134
TO RESULT IN HIGHER HEALTH CARE

00:30:36.201 --> 00:30:37.035
IN EMPLOYER COSTS.

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:38.603
WELL THIS BILL DOESN'T DIRECTLY

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.705
CURTAIL THESE EGREGIOUS AND ANTI

COMPETITIVE PRACTICES.

00:30:42.106 --> 00:30:44.475
IT BEGINS THE PROCESS OF ADDING

00:30:44.542 --> 00:30:45.910
SOME TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING.

00:30:45.977 --> 00:30:47.612
SO THAT THE EMPLOYER CAN SEE

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:48.179
WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE BEING

00:30:48.246 --> 00:30:49.147
SPENT.

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.248
THIS SHOULD BE LITTLE CAUSE FOR

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:52.483
ARGUMENT AGAINST DISCLOSING THAT

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.018
A LARGE PART OF WORKERS

TO ENTITIES THAT PROVIDE LITTLE

ON TALK ABOUT WHY I'M DOING THIS

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:14.051
AND THEN SPECIFICALLY WHY IN

00:44:14.118 --> 00:44:15.886
LARGE MEASURE I DON'T AGREE WITH

00:44:15.953 --> 00:44:17.121
THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.455
COMMITTEE IS PROPOSING AND I'M

00:44:18.522 --> 00:44:19.556

00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:26.163
STATEMENT OF WHO WE ARE AS A

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:27.197
LEGISLATURE.

00:44:27.264 --> 00:44:30.701

00:44:31.969 --> 00:44:33.871

IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:36.640
ABOUT WHAT OUR CULTURE IS WHAT

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:39.410
OUR MORALITY IS AND WHO WE ARE.

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.511
AND LET ME START OUT WITH THE

00:44:40.577 --> 00:44:41.645
STORY.

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:44.081
OF JIM MELA AND HER SON RICKY.

00:44:44.148 --> 00:44:45.616
BECAUSE IT INFORMS THE CAGE THAT

00:44:45.682 --> 00:44:47.251
IS BEING USED TO PULL THE WOOL

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.819

BECAUSE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.990
DISTINCTION IN THE GAME THAT

00:44:53.057 --> 00:44:53.991
GETS PLAYED OFTEN IN THIS

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:56.193
LEGISLATURE BASED UPON ECONOMIC

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:59.029
INTERESTS AND NOT PUBLIC POLICY.

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:01.532

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:30.494
JUST WANTED TO GET HER SON OUT

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.295
OF JAIL.

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:34.364
HER SON WAS RELEASED ADD BAIL

00:45:34.431 --> 00:45:36.733
AND WAS NEVER CHARGED AND THE

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.435
MONEY WAS NEVER RETURNED.

00:45:38.502 --> 00:45:40.037
SHE MADE WHICH HAPPENS TODAY A

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:41.405
DOWN PAYMENT.

00:45:41.472 --> 00:45:43.907
AND SHE SIGNED A PAYMENT PLAN

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:45.609
SHE SIGNED A FINANCIAL DOCUMENT

00:45:45.676 --> 00:45:47.544
THAT REQUIRED HER JUST LIKE IF

00:45:47.611 --> 00:45:49.346
YOU BUY A REFRIGERATOR IF YOU

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.948
BUY ANYTHING ON TIME.

00:45:51.014 --> 00:45:54.184
SHE SIGNED A PAYMENT PLAN THAT'S

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:55.352
WHAT SHE DID.

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:57.020
AND SO NOW SHE COMES ALONG AND

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.555
SAYS AND AND AND OBVIOUSLY

00:45:58.622 --> 00:45:59.623
THEY'RE STILL COLLECTING THERE'S

NO BAIL THERE'S NO ANYTHING

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.860
THERE'S NO OBLIGATION.

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:04.361
LET'S STOP THERE FOR A MOMENT.

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.630
BECAUSE THAT INFORMS IN FRAMES

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.365
WHERE I'M AT AS I ENGAGE IN THE

00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.500
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN THIS

00:46:09.566 --> 00:46:11.101

THEY DID.

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:16.740
THEY LOOKED AT FOUR HUNDRED BILL

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:18.542
CONTRACTS.

00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:19.943

WITH YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:46:48.772 --> 00:46:50.174
THEY COULD PUT TRACKING DEVICES

ON YOUR CAR UNDER THEIR

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:52.843

COURT ORDER TO DO THAT.

00:46:55.179 --> 00:46:56.813
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE IN

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.751
THESE CONTRACTS ARE NOTHING LESS

00:47:00.817 --> 00:47:01.718
THAN A GREGIS.

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:02.519
AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED IS IN THE

00:47:02.586 --> 00:47:04.254
MEANTIME AS I WAS WORKING ON

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.155
THIS LAST YEAR.

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.523
THAT LITIGATION STARTED IN

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.091
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY JUDGE

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.526
FINSTER MARKER HAD A CASE I HAVE

THE BILL WAS RECESS.

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.037
THE BILL MYSTERY SAYS IN THEIR

ARGUMENTS LISTEN TO THIS THIS IS

00:47:21.104 --> 00:47:22.806
ON BELIEVABLE AND THEY HAD

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:24.441
TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE.

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.709
THEY SAY IN THEIR IN THEIR

THE DOCUMENT THAT THEY FILED

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:31.048
WITH THE COURT.

00:47:31.114 --> 00:47:34.851
THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY.

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:35.953
THERE IS NO CALIFORNIA AUTHORITY

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.888
MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE WHO.

00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.456
IN THE END DOORS LAWS EVERY DAY

00:47:39.523 --> 00:47:41.491
OF THE WEEK THAT HAS CONSTRUED

00:47:41.558 --> 00:47:43.460
AN AGREEMENT RELATING TO A BAIL

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:45.662
BOND AS A CONSUMER CREDIT

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:46.663
CONTRACT.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:48.165
THAT'S THE LEGAL POSITION.

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:50.534
THEY HAVE TAKEN A BAZAAR AN

00:47:50.601 --> 00:47:53.904
UNBELIEVABLE APPROACH.

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:56.473
THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY TO US.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.242
THAT THERE IS A CRAZY WITH THE

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:59.743
TIME THE JUDGE I MEAN WHAT'S HIS

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.445
NAME UP ROSENTHAL ENACTED THE

00:48:01.511 --> 00:48:03.046
DEBT COLLECTION ACTED IN THE

00:48:03.113 --> 00:48:05.315
SEVENTIES WELL DIDN'T SAY BAIL

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:06.950
BONDSMAN WILL ALSO DIDN'T SAY

00:48:07.017 --> 00:48:08.518
ELECTRIC CARS AND OTHER THINGS

00:48:08.585 --> 00:48:09.486
WHAT MAKES THE SEAT BELTS.

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:10.921
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:48:10.988 --> 00:48:12.389
AND SO WHAT I'M DOING.

00:48:12.456 --> 00:48:14.391
AND WHAT HAPPENED BETH THIRTY

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:15.692
EIGHT TO VOTE IN THE SENATE.

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:17.561
WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS ISSUE IS

00:48:17.628 --> 00:48:19.630
ANALYZE NOT TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:21.064
THAT INFORMS THE AMENDMENT?

00:48:21.131 --> 00:48:22.266
IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THAT

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:23.734
WAS THOROUGHLY ADVISED BY PRETTY

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.469
SMART LAWYERS.

00:48:25.535 --> 00:48:26.637
THEY CAME OUT TEND TO DO TO TO

00:48:26.703 --> 00:48:30.173
NOT VOTING.

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.807
THERE'S BEEN NO NO VOTES ON THIS

00:48:30.874 --> 00:48:32.009
BILL.

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:32.609
AND I UNDERSTAND THE CAN ARGUE

00:48:32.676 --> 00:48:33.243
THAT WAS IN THE MEMBERS ON THE

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.111
SENATE AND APPROPRIATIONS THE

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:34.478
LIKE I GET IT.

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.579
BUT IT'S SUCH A FUNDAMENTAL

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:37.347
POSITION BASICALLY WHAT THIS

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:39.383
BILL SAYS WHAT THIS BILL SAYS IN

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:40.651
THE SIMPLEST TERMS.

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:42.853
IS THAT THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:44.354
JURISPRUDENCE THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.756
FORCED IN THIS STATE FOR MORE

00:48:45.822 --> 00:48:47.524
THAN FIFTY YEARS APPLIES TO

00:48:47.591 --> 00:48:48.925
EVERYBODY.

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:49.760
THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.996
CONTRACT IT APPLIES TO EVERYBODY.

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:54.398
AND THERE CHIANG IT DOESN'T

00:48:54.464 --> 00:48:56.533
APPLY TO THEM AND GUESS WHAT

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.268
JUDGE FINSTER MARKER SAID.

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.803
JUDGE FIXTURE MONSTER TOLD THEM

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:01.738
YOUR BOOK YOU KNOW WHAT AND HE

00:49:01.805 --> 00:49:03.373
BASICALLY SAID IN THE COURT CASE

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.108
THAT HAPPENED SOME WEEKS AGO THE

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.010
PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE

00:49:07.077 --> 00:49:09.046
PERSONAL FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.414
PURPOSES UNAMBIGUOUS.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.282
THE LANGUAGE IF THE LANGUAGE IS

00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:13.817
CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS THERE'S NO

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:15.585
NEED FOR INSTRUCTION NOR IS IT

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.154
NECESSARY TO RESORT TO ADDITION

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:18.555
TO THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:49:18.622 --> 00:49:19.923
IN OTHER WORDS THEY SAID THE

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:21.958
ARGUMENT THAT THEY'RE EXEMPT.

00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:24.328
FROM THIS IS RIDICULOUS OKAY.

00:49:24.394 --> 00:49:26.363
AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT AT

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:27.397
THIS THING THE THE ARE THE

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:28.999
ARGUMENT OF WHAT'S REALLY REALLY

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:30.434
HAPPENING IN THIS IN THIS

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.135
SITUATION WHY DO WE HAVE.

00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:33.603
PARTICULARLY THE SECURITY

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:34.571
COMPANIES COMING AFTER US I'M

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:35.405
LET'S TAKE AN AMENDMENT THAT I

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:36.573
TOLD THE CHAIR.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.342
RIGHT BEFORE THIS THIS HEARING

00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:39.810
TO TO QUALIFY FOR THAT.

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:41.978
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE REAL

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.814
WORLD IS THAT INPUT BILL AGENT

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.148

00:49:45.215 --> 00:49:47.551
THERE'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

00:49:47.617 --> 00:49:49.019
THE SURETY COMPANY INSURANCE

00:49:49.086 --> 00:49:50.487
COMPANY THAT SELLS THE BOND TO

00:49:50.554 --> 00:49:51.455
THE BILL AGENT.

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.122
AND THEN THERE'S THE

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:57.627
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BELL

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:59.229
AGENT AND THE CUSTOMER.

00:49:59.296 --> 00:50:00.097
IN A NORMAL SITUATION LET'S

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.832
ASSUME IT'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:02.466
DOLLARS BAIL THE THAT THAT THEY

00:50:02.532 --> 00:50:03.066
CHARGE 10% WHICH IS ALSO BEING

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.901
CHALLENGED.

00:50:04.968 --> 00:50:06.269
THAT THE IS TAUGHT TOWARD --

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:07.037

YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.211
AND SO BAD BOY BILLS RIGHT

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:15.278
TWENTY THREE ON A CHECK TO THE

00:50:15.345 --> 00:50:16.113
INSURANCE COMPANY AND THEY'RE

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:16.680
DONE.

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:18.815
THEN THE BAD BOY BILL COMPANY

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:21.084
COMES ALONG AND ENTERS INTO A

00:50:21.151 --> 00:50:22.753
FINANCING AGREEMENT BECAUSE MRS

00:50:22.819 --> 00:50:24.855
ELITE DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:25.989
AND THEY SIGNED AN AGREEMENT

00:50:26.056 --> 00:50:27.224
THAT SAYS WE CAN DO EVERYTHING

00:50:27.290 --> 00:50:28.291
POSSIBLE.

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:30.961
THAT WE SEE IN ALL THE ISSUES TO

00:50:31.027 --> 00:50:34.297
GO OUT AND COLLECT.

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:37.768
YOUR AVAILABLE BILL CONTACT

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:40.737
RIGHT TO GO OUT AND COLLECT AND

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:41.571
THEY GO OUT AND DO ALL THEIR

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:41.972
STUFF TO DO IT.

00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:42.739
AND SO THERE'S A SEPARATION

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:44.207
BETWEEN THE SALE OF THIS THING

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.742
AND IN THE BAD BOY BILL CONTRACT

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.444
EVERY SINGLE INSTALLMENT

00:50:47.511 --> 00:50:52.449
CONTRACT IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS.

00:50:52.516 --> 00:50:53.817
THAT.

00:50:53.884 --> 00:50:54.718
THERE'S NO LIABILITY FOR THE

00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:55.585
INSURANCE COMPANY IT IS CLEAR

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:56.620
WHY BECAUSE ANY LAWYER WOULD BE

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:01.691
OF A BILL COMPANY IT

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.193
SPECIFICALLY SAYS IN THE

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.761
INSTALLMENT CONTRACT.

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:07.097
THAT YOU ARE NOT LAW THAT WE ARE

THIS IN THIS A CASE PENDING IN

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:24.314
THE CASE ALREADY WAS DISPOSED OF

00:51:24.381 --> 00:51:25.449
THE ONLY QUESTION IS.

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:26.616
ARE THEY GOING TO APPEAL THEY'LL

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.418
BOTH BAD BAD BILL BOYS COMPANIES

00:51:28.485 --> 00:51:29.252
LOST.

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:30.720
IN TERMS OF RETROACTIVITY TO THE

00:51:30.787 --> 00:51:31.855
ARGUMENT THAT THE INSURANCE

00:51:31.922 --> 00:51:34.124
COMPANIES ARE MAKING AND THESE

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.625
OTHER GUYS IS RETROACTIVITY.

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.060
THAT WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO DO

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:37.961
AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO

00:51:38.028 --> 00:51:39.396
ACCOMPLISH IN THE AMENDMENTS

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.931
THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.599
THAT THE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:44.201
WANTS ME TO TAKE THAT I WILL NOT.

00:51:44.267 --> 00:51:45.702
OF THIS COUPLE MIGHT TAKE BUT I

00:51:45.769 --> 00:51:47.170
DON'T WANT TO TAKE ON IS BECAUSE

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:49.072
THEY'RE SAYING THAT WHAT WE'RE

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:50.707
SAYING IN THE LAW IS THAT.

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:52.108
IS THAT THIS.

00:51:52.175 --> 00:51:54.444
THIS IS NOT DISPOSITIVE UNDER

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.112
THE AMENDMENTS WHAT WE SAY IN

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:57.247
THE LAW.

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:58.415
IN WHAT WE'RE SAYING HERE THAT

00:51:58.482 --> 00:51:59.883
THEY WANT TO TAKE OUT IN THE

00:51:59.950 --> 00:52:01.585
AMENDMENTS IS THE LANGUAGE THAT

00:52:01.651 --> 00:52:05.555
SAYS THIS PARAGRAPH IS

00:52:05.622 --> 00:52:07.224
DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.458
THIS PARAGRAPH IS DECLARED TO

00:52:08.525 --> 00:52:09.726
EXISTING LAW.

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:10.527
BY ME SAYING THE DECLARATORY

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:11.428
DIGESTING LAW THAT THEY'RE

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:12.062
SAYING IS REPORTING A THUMB ON

00:52:12.128 --> 00:52:14.197
THE SCALE IN THE EXISTING CASE

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.365
NOT TRUE.

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:16.433
THEY'RE SAYING THAT IT'S RETRO

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.168
ACTIVITY IS BEING APPLIED NOT

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:18.969
TRUE.

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.537
IF YOU WOULD MAKE A TELEPHONE

CALL AND DO THE RESEARCH AT THE

00:52:22.038 --> 00:52:23.473
LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S OFFICE

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:24.474
YEARS WHICH YOU WOULD LEARN.

00:52:24.541 --> 00:52:25.408
YOU WOULD LEARN THAT THE

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:27.077
LEGISLATURE HAS THE RIGHT TO

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:28.378
CLARIFY THE LAW.

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:29.279
THAT THERE'S A DISTINCTION

00:52:29.346 --> 00:52:30.814
BETWEEN CLARIFICATION

00:52:30.881 --> 00:52:31.781
RETROACTIVITY.

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:32.949
THAT WHAT YOU WOULD LEARN IS

00:52:33.016 --> 00:52:34.618
THAT IF YOU WANT RETRO ACTIVITY

00:52:34.684 --> 00:52:35.886
THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE

00:52:35.952 --> 00:52:37.153
TO WRITE AS WE HAVE DONE MANY

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:38.822
TIMES IN THE PAST.

00:52:38.889 --> 00:52:40.290
YOU HAVE TO WRITE IN THE LAW

00:52:40.357 --> 00:52:41.992
THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE THAT'S

00:52:42.058 --> 00:52:43.460
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

00:52:43.527 --> 00:52:44.995
YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:48.198
RETROACTIVE PERIOD END OF ISSUE.

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.666
THERE ARE CASES ALREADY

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:51.067
HISTORICALLY WE'VE SEEN I'VE

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.068
JUST PULLED UP ONE WITH JIMMY

00:52:52.135 --> 00:52:54.671
GOMEZ DID A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND

00:52:54.738 --> 00:52:55.906
FIFTEEN THE PEOPLE HERE VOTED ON

00:52:55.972 --> 00:52:57.173
THE DEALT WITH IMMIGRATION

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:58.575
STATUS OF MINOR CHILD AND IT

00:52:58.642 --> 00:52:59.843
SAYS IN THE PROVISION.

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.144
THE PROVISIONS THE SECTION --

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:02.779
DECLARATORY JESTING LOGS ACTED

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:03.480
WHAT WE'RE SAYING.

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:05.081
AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES

00:53:05.148 --> 00:53:06.616
UNDER THE LAW.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.285
IS WHAT HAPPENS WE'RE WHAT

00:53:08.351 --> 00:53:10.186
HAPPENS IF YOU'RE DOING THAT ALL

00:53:10.253 --> 00:53:11.488
THAT HAPPENS IS WE AS A

00:53:11.555 --> 00:53:13.490
LEGISLATURE WE AS A BODY ARE

00:53:13.557 --> 00:53:15.125
SAYING AS A GROUP THAT WE

00:53:15.191 --> 00:53:16.159
BELIEVE.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.594
THAT THIS IS THE INTENT WHAT

00:53:17.661 --> 00:53:19.095
HAPPENS THERE.

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:20.897
WHAT HAPPENS THERE IS THAT THE

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.566
COURT TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION?

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:24.000
THE GENERAL RULE REGARDING

00:53:24.067 --> 00:53:25.569
RETROACTIVITY IS THE TAX STATURE

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:26.836
TO PRESUME TO OPERATE

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:28.838
PROSPECTIVELY THAT ON MATTERS

00:53:28.905 --> 00:53:30.373
OCCURRING AFTER THE STATUTE'S

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.908
ENACTMENT UNLESS THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:34.144
COULD CLEARLY INTENDS OTHERWISE.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.445
WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.613
AND I GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.548
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION NINETEEN

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:39.950
NINETY ONE POINT ONE FOUR WHAT

00:53:40.016 --> 00:53:43.353
ORDER TO HAVE RETROACTIVITY

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:43.987
HERE'S THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE TO

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:44.521
HAVE.

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:45.155
THIS SECTION APPLIES

00:53:45.221 --> 00:53:45.956
RETROACTIVELY TO ANY EMPLOYEE

00:53:46.022 --> 00:53:47.624
MAKES IT CLEAR WE DON'T SAY THAT

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:49.159
HISTORICALLY THIS INSTITUTION I

00:53:49.225 --> 00:53:50.794
HAVE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES HAVE

00:53:50.860 --> 00:53:52.495
DECLARED OF EXISTING LAW AND

00:53:52.562 --> 00:53:53.730
BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT THE COURTS

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.131
SAY IN THOSE CASES WHEN YOU

00:53:55.198 --> 00:53:57.233
DECLARE EXISTING LAW.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:53:58.335
IS THAT IN THIS IS THAT THE CASE

00:53:58.401 --> 00:53:59.102
THAT WAS GIVEN TO A LEDGE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.204
COUNCIL MACLEOD VERSES IMPLEMENT

00:54:01.271 --> 00:54:02.339
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:03.840
IT IS TRUE THAT IF THE COURTS

00:54:03.907 --> 00:54:04.975
HAVE NOT YET FINALLY

00:54:05.041 --> 00:54:06.276
INCONCLUSIVELY INTERPRETED

00:54:06.343 --> 00:54:08.078
STATUTE AND ARE IN THE PROCESS

00:54:08.144 --> 00:54:10.580
OF DOING SO A DECLARATION BY THE

00:54:10.647 --> 00:54:11.848
LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT TO DO.

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.116
AS TO WHAT AND EARLIER

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.050
LEGISLATURE INTENDED IS

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:17.454
CONSIDERATION ALL WE'RE SAYING

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.055
IS A STATEMENT AS TO WHO WE ARE.

00:54:19.122 --> 00:54:20.690
WITH WE DON'T SAY ANYTHING IF

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:22.459
WERE SILENT ON THE ISSUE AND WE

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:24.494
DON'T STEP UP THAT SAYS WE WANT

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:26.363
CONSUMER PROTECTION WE ARE

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.897
MAKING A STATEMENT TO EVERYBODY

00:54:27.964 --> 00:54:30.333
AND TO THIS WORLD WE ARE.

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.002
NOT GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE

00:54:32.068 --> 00:54:33.937
COURT WE ARE NOT BECAUSE WE DO

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:34.971
NOT USE THE WORD RIGHT TO

00:54:35.038 --> 00:54:37.073
ACTIVITY WE ARE SIMPLY GIVING

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:37.941
GUIDANCE.

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:39.476
SO MY ARGUMENT TO YOU IS THE

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:41.077
COURTS ALREADY DECIDED THIS.

00:54:41.144 --> 00:54:43.279
THAT IS PURE COMMON SENSE THAT

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.614
THE NATURE AND DEGREE JUST

00:54:44.681 --> 00:54:46.282
NATURE OF THESE CONTRACTS AND

00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:47.751
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT.

00:54:47.817 --> 00:54:48.618
AND THE TOTAL STUFF I'M READING

00:54:48.685 --> 00:54:49.986
PROVISIONS I CAN READ THOSE

00:54:50.053 --> 00:54:51.621
SPECIFIC PROVISIONS THAT EACH

00:54:51.688 --> 00:54:53.189
COMPANY THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED OF

00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.924
THEM AS TO WHAT THEY SAY.

00:54:54.991 --> 00:54:56.126
AND SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHITE

00:54:56.192 --> 00:54:57.727
THE BILL EVERYBODY LIKES BECAUSE

00:54:57.794 --> 00:54:59.129
THEY SAY GOOD GOING FORWARD.

00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:01.598
THE ISSUE IS WE NEED TO MAKE IT

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:02.866
THE DECLARATORY STATEMENT THE

00:55:02.932 --> 00:55:03.800
PURCHASE DATE IS NOT

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.735
RETROACTIVITY AND I WOULD

00:55:05.802 --> 00:55:07.103
SUGGEST -- HERE IT IS THE BILL

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:08.872
BOY CONTRACTORS TO BE CLEAR SAYS

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.173
JUST EVERYBODY KNOWS.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.574
THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS NOT A

00:55:11.641 --> 00:55:13.710
PARTY TO ANY PREMIUM FINANCING.

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:15.278
ANY FINANCIAL AGREEMENT IS

00:55:15.345 --> 00:55:17.347
STRICTLY BETWEEN THE BAIL AGENTS

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:17.947
WAS AGENCY IN THE AND THEN THE

00:55:18.014 --> 00:55:19.315
DOOR THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY THAT'S

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:20.517
WHAT THEY ALL SAY.

00:55:20.583 --> 00:55:21.651
SO WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING AND

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:23.520
WHY THE INSURANCE FRIENDS OF ALL

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.120
OF OURS ARE COMING HERE AND

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:26.523
SAYING TO US WE DON'T LIKE THIS

00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:27.524
IS BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS OF

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.925
THE BAIL AGENTS.

00:55:28.992 --> 00:55:30.760
AND THEY HAVE TO SELL CONTRACTS

00:55:30.827 --> 00:55:32.028
TO THE BAIL AGENTS AND THEY

00:55:32.095 --> 00:55:33.663
DON'T WANT TO BE LIABLE FOR THE

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.899
ACTIVITY AND I'M TELLING YOU I

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:37.767
WILL GIVE YOU AN AMENDMENT THAT

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:38.101
SAYS.

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.102
SURE THE INSURANCE DIDN'T

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:40.236
NOTHING IN THIS BILL WILL

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:42.639
INCLUDE LIABILITY FOR SURETIES

00:55:42.706 --> 00:55:43.540
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT THE ONES WHO

00:55:43.606 --> 00:55:44.874
AND GAVE THE BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:55:44.941 --> 00:55:46.309
THAT SOLVES IT BUT IT PUTS THE

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:47.877
SURETY COMPANIES IN A HORRIBLE

00:55:47.944 --> 00:55:50.013
SITUATION WHERE NOT FOR LEGAL

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.214
REASONS.

00:55:51.881 --> 00:55:53.283
CLOSING NOW FOR ANY OTHER

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:55.485
REASONS THE BOTTOM LINE IS. FOR

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:56.653
BUSINESS REASONS BECAUSE THEY

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:58.521
CAN'T BE ADVERSE TO THEIR

00:55:58.588 --> 00:55:59.756
CUSTOMER WHO'S THE BAIL AGENT

00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:06.596
WHO ENGAGE IN THIS AGREE JUST

00:56:06.663 --> 00:56:08.364

THIS IS A GOOD BILL.

00:56:08.898 --> 00:56:09.699
AND FOR THOSE REASONS THE

00:56:09.766 --> 00:56:10.433
AMENDMENTS DO NOT PROMOTE

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:11.568
PROMOTE RETROACTIVITY AND FOR

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:12.402

WAS DESCRIBED AS FINAL IS.

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:56.225
REALLY THE FIRST STEP IN ANY

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:59.829
LITIGATION WHERE THE DEFENDANT

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:01.864
COMES IN AND SAYS I DON'T REALLY

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:03.633

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:07.003
TO A HILL OF BEANS -- AND THE

JUDGE REJECTED THAT ARGUMENT ALL

01:00:09.405 --> 01:00:11.741
OTHER ISSUES ARE NOT FINAL AND

CONTINUING IN PENDING LITIGATION

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:14.644

CURRENT STATUS OF THE PENDING

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.417
LITIGATION WILK CAN I JUST PUT A

01:00:21.484 --> 01:00:21.985
FINER POINT MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:00:22.051 --> 01:00:23.052
COULD THINK IT'S REALLY

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:23.553
IMPORTANT I THINK THAT'S

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:24.620
MISLEADING.

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:26.356
BECAUSE THERE'S TWO ISSUES IN

01:00:26.422 --> 01:00:27.390
ANY CASE.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:30.660
ISSUE NUMBER ONE IS DOES THE LAW

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:31.894
APPLY.

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.196

DID THEY DO WITH THEIR CLAIM TO

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:34.697
DO.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:36.566
THE QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS

01:00:36.632 --> 01:00:37.934
DOES THE LAW APPLY.

01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:39.435
THIS BODY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:00:39.502 --> 01:00:40.803
THE FACTUAL ASSERTIONS AS TO

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.071
WHETHER OR NOT THEY VIOLATED

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.439
WHAT HAPPENED WHAT WAS

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:48.211
WHAT HAPPENED WAS THE BALLOT

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.846
JUST BY BOY BAIL INDUSTRY

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.614
BASICALLY SAID TO THE COURT?

01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.383
YOU'RE SUING ME FOR THIS AND YOU

01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:54.584
CAN'T SUE ME FOR THIS BECAUSE

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.818
THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY.

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:56.786
WHAT WE'RE ASKING WE'RE

01:00:56.853 --> 01:00:58.254
DISCUSSING HERE IN THIS

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.989
COMMITTEE IS DOES THE LAW APPLY?

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:01.791
AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS A BODY

01:01:01.858 --> 01:01:04.227
IS TO SAY WE THINK IN GIVING

01:01:04.293 --> 01:01:04.694
GUIDANCE TO COURTS NOT

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:07.130
RETROACTIVITY THAT WE THINK IT

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:09.499
DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.589
CHARITES.

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.157
JUST TO MAKE IT CLEAR BECAUSE I

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:42.692
THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE I'M NOT

01:02:42.758 --> 01:02:44.193
GOING AFTER INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.928
I KNOW INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:46.896
TO PROTECT.

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:48.264
THEIR CUSTOMER AND THEIR

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:50.233
CUSTOMERS ENGAGED IN BAD

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.602
ACTIVITY BAD BOY BALES THIS BILL

I AM WILLING TO TAKE THAT

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.874

I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.281
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WE'RE TRYING

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:06.716
TO DO I'M JUST TRYING TO DEAL

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:08.151
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP.

01:03:08.217 --> 01:03:09.785
BETWEEN THE AGENT AND THE

TREAT CONSUMERS FAIRLY AND THE

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:16.592
REASON THIS IS SO IMPORTANT FOR

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:18.227
CONSIDERATION FOR THE COURTS.

01:03:18.294 --> 01:03:19.195
IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CHIEF

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:20.696
JUSTICE'S PRE TRIAL DETENTION

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:22.031
WORKING GROUP THAT HERE'S THE

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.366
REAL REASON BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:24.233
TO HAPPEN.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:24.967
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:26.269
HAPPEN WITH BAYLOR NOT WHAT'S

01:03:26.335 --> 01:03:27.737
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH BAIL BUT WE

SAW THE PRE TRIAL DETENTION

01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.574
REPORT THAT WAS DONE IN MAY TWO

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:32.241

JUDGES APPOINTED BY THE CHIEF

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:35.278

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:36.479
THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:03:36.546 --> 01:03:37.914
AND FIVE THOUSAND BILL CONTRACTS

EVERYONE OF THOSE FAMILIES

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:45.454
EVERYONE OF THOSE PEOPLE.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:46.622
IF YOU TAKE THE VIEW THAT WE'RE

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:47.523
NOT GOING TO MAKE A STATEMENT

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.292
THAT THIS PROTECTION APPLIES TO

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:50.693
THEM COULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.928
EXTRAORDINARY BEHAVIOR.

01:03:51.994 --> 01:03:53.095
THE BAIL INDUSTRY HAS

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.064
TRANSFORMED FROM BEING THE DAYS

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.499
WHEN MY DAD USED TO GO AND BE A

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.867
JAILHOUSE LAWYER.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.302
ND THEY GIVE THE QUICKLY IS ONE

01:03:59.368 --> 01:03:59.902
OF HIS CLIENTS WOULD GIVE THE

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.237
CLERK TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS AND

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.738
COME BACK AND GET THE TWO

01:04:02.805 --> 01:04:03.339
HUNDRED BUCKS BACK FROM THE

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.774
CLERK. TO A SOPHISTICATED

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.076
FINNCIAL INDUSTRY THAT IS LIKE

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:08.444
THE PREDATORY LENDING BUSINESS

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.646
WITH A HUGE FEES AND COSTS WE'VE

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:12.582
ALL HEARD THE ANECDOTAL STORIES

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:14.317
ABOUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF A

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.318
SMALL BAIL.

01:04:15.384 --> 01:04:16.719
FEE TURNING INTO TENS AND

01:04:16.786 --> 01:04:18.254
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT'S WHAT

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:20.590
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT SO IF

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:22.358
THE BILL IS TO CONTINUES OR NOT.

01:04:22.425 --> 01:04:23.859
IF YOU LOOK AT IT PROSPECTIVELY

01:04:23.926 --> 01:04:25.494
WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ALL THE

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.129
PEOPLE AS A BODY COURTS WILL

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:28.464
DECIDE WOOD COURTS WILL DECIDE

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.699
AND THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO DO

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:30.900
SO WE'RE NOT ACTING DIRECTOR

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:31.667
ACTIVITY.

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:32.602
THERE'S NO RETROACTIVITY

01:04:32.668 --> 01:04:35.171
LANGUAGE HERE ALL WE'RE DOING IS

01:04:35.238 --> 01:04:36.973
IS DECLARING THE WHAT THE LAW IS

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:37.740
WE'VE DONE IT A HUNDRED TIMES

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:38.975
BEFORE.

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:40.343
MY ADVICE FROM COUNSEL IS THAT

01:04:40.409 --> 01:04:41.944
CLEARLY THAT IS JUST

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:43.446
CONSIDERATION TO THE COURTS I

01:04:43.512 --> 01:04:44.847
READ YOU THE CASE AND WE'RE

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:46.449
TELLING THEM THIS IS WHAT WE

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:47.717
BELIEVE CHIU IT DO THE SAME BUT

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:48.951
WE'RE MAKING A STATEMENT.

01:04:49.018 --> 01:04:51.120
AND I CAN'T SIT HERE AND EXCLUDE

01:04:51.187 --> 01:04:52.989
THAT BECAUSE EVERYONE OF THOSE

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:54.857
PEOPLE EVERY DAY BUT THIS THING

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.192
DOESN'T GET PAST HIS LIVES BEING

01:04:56.259 --> 01:04:58.728
AFFECTED BY UNSCRUPULOUS PEOPLE

01:04:58.794 --> 01:04:59.428
WHO SAY.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.097
THE BAIL WELL I MEAN THE THE

01:05:01.163 --> 01:05:02.865
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS LAWS DON'T

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:06.302
APPLY TO US THAT IS THE PROBLEM

01:05:06.369 --> 01:05:08.070
WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:10.139
MRS LEACH SON AND MRS ELITE ARE

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:12.408
CONTINUALLY ABUSE GOING FORWARD

IN ALL OF THESE VERY LONG

01:05:20.283 --> 01:05:21.183
CONTRACTS THAT EXIST.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:22.852
THE YEAR THE BILL AS PROPOSED --

AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR -- I

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.394
WANT TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BE

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.595
AWARE OF THAT.

01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:34.096

REACHING GOING ON BUT AS A

01:05:59.055 --> 01:06:01.223
LAWYER LOOKING AT THE BILL I

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.266
I AS A LAWYER ACTUALLY FEEL

THAT'S AN OVER REACH.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.069
SO.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:15.104
I I DON'T THINK.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.306
THE ONE ISSUE.

01:06:17.373 --> 01:06:18.908
JUSTIFIES THE OTHER ISSUE.

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:21.777
SOI ACTUALLY AM IN FAVOR OF

01:06:21.844 --> 01:06:24.547
THAT AMENDMENT A I PERSONALLY.

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.116
THE BAIL SYSTEM GOES BACK TO

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:29.285
ENGLAND SAXON TIMES.

01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:32.388
IT IT IS A PART OF OUR NATION'S

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.423
FOUNDING [inaudible]

01:06:34.490 --> 01:06:35.991
EIGHTH AMENDMENT.

SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE COME TO

01:06:46.435 --> 01:06:47.603
A STATE OF AFFAIRS WHERE THIS.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.205
SYSTEM WHICH IS SO CLOSELY

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.307
INTERTWINED WITH THE COURTS.

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.875
HAS BEEN TREATED AS SORT OF

01:06:52.942 --> 01:06:54.143
SEPARATE AND APART.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:55.845
DOES NOT SHOCK ME I DON'T THINK

01:06:55.911 --> 01:06:57.213
IT'S AN ERROR.

01:06:57.279 --> 01:06:58.381
I THINK IS ROOTED IN THE

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.950
EVOLUTION OF OUR LEGAL SYSTEM

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:07.870
IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO LEAVE

SOMETHING BETTER THAN NOTHING SO

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:16.345
I JUST ASK THAT IF THIS BILL

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:18.180

ON THE FLOOR -- THAT IF IT DOES

01:10:35.364 --> 01:10:36.932

THE INSURANCE PART THAT'S THE

01:11:55.077 --> 01:11:55.911
IMPORTANT POINT.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.813
IS A MISTER VOEPEL IT DIDN'T

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.381

BUT I'M WILLING TO TAKE THAT

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.656
WOULD BASICALLY EXEMPT THE

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:08.857
INSURANCE BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:12:08.924 --> 01:12:10.025
LOOKING AT THE INSURANCE PRODUCT

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.226
AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:14.363
SPECIFICALLY IN THEIR CONTRACTS

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.130
SAY.

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:15.731
DON'T COME BACK TO US IF YOU

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:17.199
GUYS WANT A PAYMENT PLAN YOU DO

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:18.167
THAT THAT'S A FINANCIAL

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.435
INSTRUMENT ONCE YOU GET TO A

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:20.936
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT.

01:12:21.003 --> 01:12:22.971
YOU GET OUT OF THE RANGE OF BAIL

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:23.605
INDUSTRY IT'S NOT A BAIL IT'S

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:26.041
JUST A TYPICAL CONSUMER.

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.376
CONTRACT FOR FINANCING LIKE YOUR

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.812
FINANCING REFRIGERATOR AT SEARS

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.580
UNDERSTOOD AG SO IT HAS NOTHING

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:32.915
TO DO WITH IT AND I SAID THIS

01:12:32.981 --> 01:12:34.616
DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM SO I'M NOT

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:35.250
EVEN GOING THERE.

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:36.351
LET'S SEE I GO WITH THEIR

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:37.820
ARGUMENT BECAUSE THIS IS AN

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.389
INSURANCE PRODUCT IT IS UNDER

01:12:40.456 --> 01:12:41.957
THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER.

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.293
AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

01:12:44.359 --> 01:12:47.596
HAS TO UP STRINGENTLY APPROVED

01:12:47.663 --> 01:12:49.832
VARIOUS CONTRACTS ANY CONSUMER

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:52.201
THE COMPLAINTS TO THE INSURANCE

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.736
COMMISSIONER ABOUT A CONTRACT.

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.604
LET ME TELL YA THOSE THAT HOLD

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.740
LICENSE THEY QUIVER IN THEIR

01:12:57.806 --> 01:12:59.241
SHOES BECAUSE YOU DO NOT WANT TO

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:00.542
CALIFORNIA INSURANCE

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:03.312
COMMISSIONER COMING IN ON YOU.

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.346
SO.

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:05.013
MAYBE IT'S MY MIND SET FROM THE

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.249
INDUSTRY BUT I'M LOOKING AT THIS

01:13:07.316 --> 01:13:09.451
AS PURELY AN INSURANCE PRODUCT.

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:12.588
AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS ARE NOT

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.891
CONSIDERED -- GOODS OR SERVICES

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:17.626
THIS IS THE FINANCIAL SERVICES

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.261
PRODUCTS.

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:20.996
BECAUSE THERE'S BRINGING PEOPLE

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:22.498
OUT OF JAIL.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.099
AND THAT IS A MONEY MATTER

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:26.835
THAT'S THE LOGIC IN THE THE THE

01:13:26.902 --> 01:13:28.937
BUILD BUSINESS SO.

01:13:29.004 --> 01:13:30.439
CALM I WAS PROBABLY GOING AYE

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:31.006
AYE IN A START OKAY SAY ONE

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:32.674
THING SO NOW LET'S ASSUME THAT

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:33.475
THERE'S A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:34.409
DOLLARS BAIL.

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:36.945
LET'S ASSUME THAT -- ABC BILL

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.514
COMPANY COMES IN AND GIVES BAD

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.616
BOY UP UP THE SURETY BOND FOR

01:13:40.682 --> 01:13:42.084
THE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.286
AND THEY CHARGE THE BILL BAD BOY

01:13:44.353 --> 01:13:46.188
A THE TEN THOUSAND RPM IN THE

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:47.689
TRUCK AND TWENTY THREE BOX.

01:13:47.756 --> 01:13:49.625
NOW BAD BOY GOES OUT AND GET IN

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:51.059
ON THE GUY THERE TO TAKE IT OUT

01:13:51.126 --> 01:13:52.261
MISTER HERTZBERG ENABLE PAYMENT

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.929
PLAN WITH ME.

01:13:53.996 --> 01:13:54.930
IF I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:13:54.997 --> 01:13:56.431
PAYMENT PLAN WITH BAD BOY AND

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:57.699
THE I'VE I'VE BEHIND ON MY

01:13:57.766 --> 01:13:59.067
PAYMENTS.

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.135
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I SKIP.

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:01.804
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:04.072
COURT AND THE INSURANCE PRODUCT

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.374
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THAT.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.176
THE ONLY THING I CARE ABOUT IS

01:14:07.242 --> 01:14:08.710
WHETHER MR HERTZBERG IS MAKING

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:12.581
pENGAGE IN BEHAVIOR AND HOW I CAN

01:14:12.648 --> 01:14:14.449
BREAK DOWN PEOPLE'S DOORS IF

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:15.751
YOU'RE IT SAYS IN HIS CONTRACT

01:14:15.818 --> 01:14:16.919
IF YOU'RE COHABITATING WITH

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:17.886
SOMEBODY.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.621
ANYBODY WHO COULD CAPITATED YOU

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.256
AGREES TO BE SEARCHED IN SEASON

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:22.558
HAVE THEIR PROPERTY SEIZED I

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.826
MEAN IT'S JUST VIOLATIVE OF

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.327
EVERY PRINCIPLE AND SO I ONLY

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.728
CARE ABOUT THAT PIECE SO YOU'RE

01:14:26.795 --> 01:14:27.462
RIGHT ABOUT THE INSURANCE

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:28.063
PRODUCT.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.398
BUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

01:14:29.464 --> 01:14:30.465
INVOLVED THIS IS ABOUT IT

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.901
FINANCIAL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT

01:14:32.968 --> 01:14:33.936
BECAUSE THESE THINGS ARE SO

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:36.839
EXPENSIVE AND WE SEE THAT SHIFT.

01:14:36.905 --> 01:14:37.840
AND SO WHAT I RESPECT YOUR

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.408
EXPERIENCE IN THE LIKE I JUST

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.410

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:43.378
IF IT'S HELP JUNE CONSIDERATION.

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:44.646
TRAFFIC.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:46.081
ALL RIGHT -- MISTER COOPER.

01:14:46.148 --> 01:14:54.823
WAS NEXT.

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:58.827
THEN -- IN ORDER TO OF AND THEN

01:14:58.894 --> 01:14:59.828
MISTER MAYES SURE SENATOR

01:14:59.895 --> 01:15:00.662
ACTUALLY COLLEAGUES ISSUES OR

01:15:00.729 --> 01:15:01.730
CONCERNS REGARDING RETROACTIVITY.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:03.665
AND I THINK THE THE Y. L. FROM

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:04.633
THE ROOM WOMEN DISCUSSING BILL

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.267
FOR WHAT A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:06.134
NOW WE'VE HAD SEVERAL

01:15:06.201 --> 01:15:06.501
CONVERSATIONS.

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:07.669
AND IS STILL COMES BACK TO THE

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:08.937
REASON WHEN THIS DILEMMA IS

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:09.571
BECAUSE THE JUDGES.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:11.039

MEET EVERY TWO YEARS.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.276
THE CHARGER ROBBERY ONE COUNTY

01:15:15.477 --> 01:15:16.945
ANOTHER COUNTY IS TO A THOUSAND

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:17.579
DOLLARS THAT'S REALLY BEEN THE

01:15:17.646 --> 01:15:18.580
BIG ISSUE IS THE JUDGES YOUR

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.315
PROPONENTS NEVER TALKED ABOUT

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:22.084
THAT AND THAT'S A THE COMMUTE

EASILY REMEDIED.

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:29.124
SO THAT THAT'S MY FRUSTRATION

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:30.525

01:15:36.965 --> 01:15:39.101
DILEMMA.

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:40.402
THAT'S NEED TO BE ADDRESSED IN A

01:15:40.469 --> 01:15:41.803

THE JUDGES.

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:53.282
BUT IF THE CALIPHATE IS

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.384

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:21.089
THEN WE'RE TAKING THE POSITION

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:28.196
THAT NO AGE AND SPECIFIC CONDUCT

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:29.731
THAT THESE CONSUMER PROTECTION

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.166
LAWS SEEK TO REGULATE.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:33.435
THAT'S BECAUSE THE INSURANCE

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.670
REGULATIONS ARE ENTIRELY SILENT

01:19:35.737 --> 01:19:37.172
ON MANY OF THESE ISSUES THEY SAY

01:19:37.239 --> 01:19:39.074
NOTHING ABOUT THE FINANCING OF

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.275
THE PREMIUMS.

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:41.843
ARE PAYMENT PLANS OR DEBT

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:44.679
COLLECTION SO IF THESE LAWS OF

01:19:44.746 --> 01:19:46.014
THE CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:47.582
DON'T APPLY.

01:19:47.649 --> 01:19:49.484
THEN NO LAWS APPLY THAT'S WHAT

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:51.186
WILL THAT'S WHAT THIS MEANS IF

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.721
WE IF WE DON'T THINK THESE LAWS

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:53.722
APPLY RIGHT NOW.

01:19:53.788 --> 01:19:54.823
BEEN THERE'S NOTHING THAT

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:58.126
REGULATES THOSE ACTIVITIES WITH

01:19:58.193 --> 01:19:58.660
EIGHT WHICH THEY ROUTINELY

01:19:58.727 --> 01:20:00.495

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.963
THEY WILL GET TO EXTEND CREDIT

01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:03.365

01:20:03.431 --> 01:20:05.700

01:20:05.767 --> 01:20:07.068

IN COURT ARE THOSE POINTS.

01:20:11.873 --> 01:20:14.609
THE ONE ISSUE IN THE ELITE CASE

01:20:14.676 --> 01:20:16.978
IN THAT HAS ANY OVERLAP WITH

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:18.680

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:21.816

THEY PROVIDE SERVICES TO LOW

01:20:44.873 --> 01:20:45.974
INCOME CONSUMERS AND THEY EXTEND

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.242
CREDIT TO THEM.

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:48.410

01:20:50.045 --> 01:20:51.813

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.148
REGULATE THAT BEHAVIOR.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:55.150

HERTZBERG BILL BECAUSE I FIND IT

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:34.476

THAT THE COMMITTEE HAS HAD IN

01:23:42.016 --> 01:23:42.984
THE DEBATE THAT THAT WOULD HAVE

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:44.285

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.487
CLEAR WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE NO

01:23:45.553 --> 01:23:46.588
PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL GOING

01:23:46.654 --> 01:23:48.022
FORWARD IF THESE ARE CONSUMER

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:49.224
PROTECTIONS THAT NEED TO BE

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.525
IMPOSED ON THEIR CONSUMER

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:51.126

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.193
IMPOSED.

01:23:52.260 --> 01:23:53.061
AND THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:53.995
CONSIDER EACH ONE OF THEM

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.096
INDIVIDUALLY AS TO WHETHER NOT

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.531
THEY ARE APPROPRIATE WE DO

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:59.033
HOWEVER HAVE A HUGE ISSUE WITH

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.502
THE LANGUAGE THAT WE BELIEVE.

01:24:00.568 --> 01:24:02.670
MAKES THIS RETROACTIVE BECAUSE

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:04.439
IF THE LAW PASSES ON JANUARY

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.841

01:24:06.908 --> 01:24:07.575
EFFECTIVE.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.310
THAN ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:11.146
BEFORE THAT THIS SHOULD HAVE

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.981
COMPLIED WITH THE LAWS THAT

01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:14.883
THERE.

01:24:14.949 --> 01:24:17.752

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:20.855
BOTH THE SURETIES SIDE OF IT AND

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:21.423

MAKE SURE THE DEFENDANT GOES TO

01:25:31.659 --> 01:25:33.127
COURT AND AND THE WAY THE BAY

01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:35.630
ALLEGIANCE TO THAT IS THAT THERE.

01:25:35.697 --> 01:25:37.432
DALY AGENT AND THE FAMILY ARE

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:40.201
BOTH OBLIGATED TO PAY A PENALTY

01:25:40.268 --> 01:25:41.336
IF THE DEFENDANT FAILS TO GO TO

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.371
COURT AND THAT CAUSES BOTH THE

01:25:43.438 --> 01:25:44.772
BAIL AGENT IN THE INDEMNITY --

01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:46.574
TO BE IN A COOPERATIVE POSITION

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.443
TO GET THE DEFENDANTS TO COURT

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.111
AND THAT'S WHY BAIL BRING SO

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:52.680
MANY PEOPLE BACK -- IS THAT

01:25:52.747 --> 01:25:54.082
COOPERATION THAT THEY HAVE IN

01:25:54.148 --> 01:25:55.216
THE RELATIONSHIP NOW WHAT'S

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.918
HAPPENED AS BEEN DISCUSSED

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.053
EARLIER IS THAT THE BAIL RATES

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:01.322
HAVE BEEN INCREASED DRAMATICALLY.

01:26:01.389 --> 01:26:03.858
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE NEED TO

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:06.261
TO FINANCE THE PREMIUMS BAIL

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:06.828
AGENTS DON'T WANT TO FINANCE

01:26:06.895 --> 01:26:08.329
PREMIUMS BAIL AGENTS HAVE ALWAYS

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:09.464
WHEN I STARTED IN THE EARLY

01:26:09.531 --> 01:26:10.431
NINETIES CERTAINLY.

01:26:10.498 --> 01:26:12.066
THEY GOT PAID THEIR PREMIUMS AND

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.868
THEN THEY WORRIED ABOUT TRYING

01:26:13.935 --> 01:26:16.204
TO SECURE THE PENALTY IF THE

01:26:16.271 --> 01:26:17.839
DEFENDANT FAILED TO APPEAR.

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:19.807
BUT AS THE BAIL SCHEDULES OF

01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:21.476
CONTINUE TO INCREASE PEOPLE

01:26:21.543 --> 01:26:22.844
SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:25.213
RESOURCES TO PAY THESE PREMIUMS

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.648
AND THEREFORE THEY'VE HAD TO

01:26:26.714 --> 01:26:28.917
COME UP WITH A FINANCING.

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:31.452
NOW AT THIS POINT THAT PROCESS

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.587
OF SETTING BAIL IS ALREADY BEEN

01:26:32.654 --> 01:26:34.322
FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY THE

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:36.090
STATE COURTS BY THE FEDERAL

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:38.459
COURTS AND BY AND AND ADMITTED

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.061
BUYER LAST TO ATTORNEY GENERAL'S.

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:42.130
THAT PROCESS THE INJUNCTION IN

01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:45.233
SAN FRANCISCO AGAINST THE

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:47.302
IMPOSITION OF AS THE FEDERAL

01:26:47.368 --> 01:26:49.003
COURT FOUND PUTTING RANDOM

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:51.539
NUMBERS NEXT PENAL CODE SECTIONS

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:53.141
IS IS ALREADY UNDER WAY.

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:56.244
AND I BELIEVE THAT WHEN THE WHEN

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.212
THAT IS RESOLVE THE AMOUNTS OF

01:26:58.279 --> 01:27:00.815
BAIL WILL GO BACK TO A NORMAL

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:03.351
AMOUNT AND OF THE THE FINANCING

01:27:03.418 --> 01:27:04.752
AND OTHER ISSUES.

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:06.487
ARE SIMPLY UNNECESSARY THE

01:27:06.554 --> 01:27:09.157
SYSTEM THAT -- MISTER HERTZBERG.

01:27:09.223 --> 01:27:10.124
RIFF Là REPLIED TO WITH HIS

FATHER WHERE YOU WOULD JUST POST

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.094
THE TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS -- I

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:13.995
DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL GET BACK

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:16.364
TO THAT BUT THE COURTS CAN ONLY

01:27:16.431 --> 01:27:21.836
IMPOSE THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:23.504
BAIL NECESSARY TO SIR LEGITIMATE

01:27:23.571 --> 01:27:23.972
GOVERNMENT PURPOSES.

01:27:24.038 --> 01:27:24.639
AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:25.306
THAT STANDARD AND WHEN THEY DO A

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:25.974
LOT OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE SIMPLY

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.075
GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:28.843
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN

01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:31.379
CHANGE THE RELATIONSHIP OF JUST

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:34.315
THE BAIL AGENTS AND TO THE

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:36.317

SEPARATING THESE TWO ENTITIES IS

01:27:52.634 --> 01:27:54.402
NOT POSSIBLE THEY ARE THE SAME

HERTZBERG CAST ON THE CUSTODIAL

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:17.992
NATURE OF SOME OF THESE

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:18.826
CONTRACTS.

01:28:18.893 --> 01:28:20.795
THAT'S THE NECESSARY AT IT HELPS

01:28:20.862 --> 01:28:22.697
THE INDEMNITY -- WHAT THE

01:28:22.764 --> 01:28:24.065
INDEMNITY -- HAS TO AVOID

01:28:24.132 --> 01:28:26.267
AMONGST ALL THINGS IS HAVING TO

RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS MOMENT IN

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:30.231
TIME BAIL BONDSMAN'S IN THE

NEED.

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.239

01:36:39.426 --> 01:36:40.828
DISCUSSED WHICH ACTUALLY STARTED

01:36:40.895 --> 01:36:42.296
BECAUSE BAD BOYS BAIL BOND SUIT

01:36:42.363 --> 01:36:43.964
ON THAT THAT WE DID NOT BRING

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.333
THAT CASE. TO A RICH ORIGINALLY --

AS WE HELP LOW INCOME CONSUMERS

01:36:50.271 --> 01:36:51.038

THEM THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:58.612
VIOLATED ALL OF THESE LAWS.

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:01.582
THEY GENERALLY.

01:37:01.649 --> 01:37:03.050
CHOOSE TO SETTLE WITH US AND WE

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:04.318
DON'T WE'VE NEVER FILED ANYTHING

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.287
IN A COURT AFFIRMATIVE WAY OKAY

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.855
TO BEGIN WITH -- BUT THEN BUT

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:09.523
THEY RESPOND EVERY SINGLE TIME

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:11.325
SAYING THAT THESE LAWS DON'T

01:37:11.392 --> 01:37:12.927
APPLY TO THEM.

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.361
OKAY I DO WANT TO SAY.

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:16.397
I HAVE NEVER SEEN INTEREST BEING

01:37:16.463 --> 01:37:18.632
CHARGED SO I AGREE THE FINANCING

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:20.467
BUT THEY DO REFER TO IT AS

01:37:20.534 --> 01:37:21.302
CREDIT BAIL.

01:37:21.368 --> 01:37:24.171
SO IT IS THE EXTENSION OF CREDIT.

01:37:24.238 --> 01:37:27.007
ALL RIGHT.

01:37:27.074 --> 01:37:29.076

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:34.648
THE MOST RECENT COURT CASE THE

01:37:34.715 --> 01:37:36.650
WORLD OF THAT WE ALL THAT HAS

01:37:36.717 --> 01:37:38.452
BEEN MADE REFERENCE -- TO THE

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:40.087
JUDGE DID MAKE A RULING WAS THAT

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:47.595
RULING IN FAVOR OF YOUR CASE.

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:48.963
IN THE MIKE YEAH A LOT OF THE

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.297
THE JUDGE FOUND THAT THE PREMIUM.

01:37:50.364 --> 01:37:51.665
FINANCING AGREEMENT THE CREDIT

01:37:51.732 --> 01:37:52.900
BAIL AGREEMENT WAS A CONSUMER

01:37:52.967 --> 01:37:55.903
CREDIT CONTRACT SO IS IT FAIR TO

01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.004
SAY THAT THE THAT.

01:37:57.071 --> 01:37:59.907
THE JUDGE -- IS SEEING THE

01:37:59.974 --> 01:38:02.543
INTENT OF EXISTING LAW AND MADE

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.877
A RULING.

01:38:03.944 --> 01:38:05.646
IN FAVOR OF WHAT MAYBE THIS BILL

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:07.948
IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH IN A

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:10.084
RETROACTIVE WAY.

01:38:10.150 --> 01:38:11.418
THE JUDGE OF THE THE THE LAW WAS

01:38:11.485 --> 01:38:13.254
CLEAR BUT THE POINT IS EVEN

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:14.588
THOUGH THE LAW IS CLEAR IF YOU

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.390
LOOK AT WHAT THE LAW PROHIBITS

01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:17.758
AND YOU LOOK AT THE ACTIONS OF

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:19.193
THE BAIL BONDS INDUSTRY.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:20.427
IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY ARE

01:38:20.494 --> 01:38:22.663
VIOLATING THE LAWS WITH THE

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.064
SPECIFIC CONTACT WE'RE NOT

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:25.532
SAYING THAT THEY'VE ALWAYS

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:28.269
ENGAGED IN THAT CONDUCT SO

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:29.670
RETROACTIVITY IS NOT.

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:30.638
A PART OF THE DISCUSSION BUT

01:38:30.704 --> 01:38:32.473
WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN SPECIFIC

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:33.407
CONDUCT THAT THESE LAWS

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:33.707
[inaudible]

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:35.309
OUTLAW.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.278
BAY ARE SUBJECT TO THOSE LAWS

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:38.846
WHICH IS WHAT THE JUDGE SAID BUT

01:38:38.912 --> 01:38:41.949
THE THE POINT IS THAT THE BAIL

01:38:42.016 --> 01:38:43.417
BONDS INDUSTRY IS SAYING THAT

01:38:43.484 --> 01:38:47.187
THE LAWS DON'T APPLY TO THEM.

01:38:47.254 --> 01:38:48.856
ALRIGHT SO AS CENTER HERTZBERG --

01:38:48.922 --> 01:38:51.492

01:38:51.558 --> 01:38:52.092

THAT MEAN NOTHING SO I'M TELLING

01:41:01.588 --> 01:41:03.257
YOU YES I CAN WRITE IT BUT

01:41:03.323 --> 01:41:04.591
THEY'RE GOING TO OBJECT TO IT

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:05.826
BECAUSE THEY'RE TRYING TO PLAY

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:08.762
IT BOTH WAYS ON THE ONE HAND

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:10.063
THEY'RE TELLING US WE'RE GOOD

BECAUSE THEY WALK IN THIS

01:41:17.571 --> 01:41:18.705
BUILDING.

01:41:18.772 --> 01:41:20.174

TOOK OUT ALL THE INTENT LANGUAGE

01:41:24.378 --> 01:41:26.313
THE STUFF I'M TAKING THAT IS A

01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.347
STICKING A FINGER IN THE EYE THE

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:28.182
BILL MYSTERY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:29.049
THIS COMMITTEE DOES TO ME EVERY.

01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:30.284

MAKE ME DO IT LAST YEAR THE

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:39.393
DOING IT NOW.

01:41:39.460 --> 01:41:40.394
GREAT.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.395
I COULD WRITE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:42.229
BUT I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T GET

01:41:42.296 --> 01:41:43.530
ACCEPTED BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT

01:41:43.597 --> 01:41:44.631
WE'RE DISCUSSING.

01:41:44.698 --> 01:41:46.633
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE SO I AM IS

01:41:46.700 --> 01:41:47.701
A TRUE ANNA MISTER CHAIR ALL IN

01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:48.268
BUT THIS I DO SHARE WITH MY

01:41:48.335 --> 01:41:49.303
COLLEAGUE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:50.571
WHY A STATEMENT BY THE AUTHOR.

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:53.907
WOULD NOT WORK WHEN IT COMES --

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:55.409
TO THE STATEMENT ABOUT NOT

01:41:55.476 --> 01:41:57.744
INVOLVING THE INSURERS OR THE

01:41:57.811 --> 01:41:59.279
BILLS AND FOR THE ASSURE ANY

01:41:59.346 --> 01:42:00.781
GROUPS OF BECAUSE THE STATE WAS

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:01.982
MADE YOU CAN'T SEPARATE THE

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.450
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:04.351
SOME OF OUR GREAT AND WE DON'T

01:42:04.418 --> 01:42:05.586
WE THINK THAT THE RELATIONSHIP

01:42:05.652 --> 01:42:07.654
AS IT IS WITH ANY INSURANCE

01:42:07.721 --> 01:42:07.921
INDUSTRY.

01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.723
AGENT AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:10.791
THEY WORK FOR ITS TWO

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:15.929
INTERRELATED TO SEPARATE ONE

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.431
FROM THE OTHER.

01:42:17.498 --> 01:42:18.765
BUT IF YOU SAY IT'S NOT AN APPLY

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:20.400
TO YOU IT MAY BE IN A RELATED

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.101
BUT YOU JUST ARE OUT OF THE DEAL.

01:42:21.168 --> 01:42:21.602
THE PROBLEM YOU HAVE A

01:42:21.668 --> 01:42:23.103
COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:24.538
CUSTOMER WHO'S THE BELLY CHEN

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:25.305
AND YOU GOT TO PROTECT WHICH I

01:42:25.372 --> 01:42:26.073

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:26.373
IT.

01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:28.275
BUT I JUST THINK IT'S AN HONEST

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:29.810
ANALYSIS.

01:42:29.877 --> 01:42:31.378
MISTER COOPER HAS ANOTHER POINT

YOU KNOW THAT.

01:42:37.050 --> 01:42:38.218

01:44:53.053 --> 01:44:54.588
DOWN TO THE LOWEST COMMON

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:56.523
DENOMINATOR IF WE CAN POSSIBLY.

01:44:56.590 --> 01:44:59.660
DO THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE

01:44:59.726 --> 01:45:02.529
SUMMARY -- IN THE ANALYSIS THAT

01:45:02.596 --> 01:45:03.363
WAS WRITTEN AND I ACTUALLY WANT

01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:04.564
TO BRING IT TO THE CONSOLE HERE

01:45:04.631 --> 01:45:07.067
IN A SECOND -- THERE ARE SEVEN

01:45:07.134 --> 01:45:08.602
ITEMS LISTED HERE.

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:10.404
IN THE SUMMER WE CAN GO TO THE

01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:11.071
BILL BUT I'M JUST GONNA LOOK AT

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:11.905
THE SUMMARY.

01:45:11.972 --> 01:45:13.607
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S

01:45:13.674 --> 01:45:16.209
AGREEMENT ON NUMBER.

01:45:16.276 --> 01:45:17.544
NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE AND

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:18.979
THERE IS NO DISAGREEMENT ON

01:45:19.046 --> 01:45:20.847
GOING FORWARD ON THOSE ITEMS AT

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.516
TH POLICY BEFORE US.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:24.751
IS A GOOD POLICY I THINK THAT'S

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:26.420
WHAT I'VE HEARD THAT TODAY --

01:45:26.486 --> 01:45:28.288
ALSO HAVE HEARD THAT SEVEN THAT

01:45:28.355 --> 01:45:29.356
YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE FIND

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:30.824
ELIMINATE NUMBER SEVEN SO WE'RE

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:32.893
REALLY TALKING ABOUT NUMBER SIX

01:45:32.959 --> 01:45:34.327
IN THIS QUESTION OF WHAT IS.

01:45:34.394 --> 01:45:37.064
A DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:38.065
CORRECT WE HAD AN HEALTH

01:45:38.131 --> 01:45:40.067
COMMITTEE -- THIS JUST YESTERDAY

01:45:40.133 --> 01:45:41.368
AND IT MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME

01:45:41.435 --> 01:45:42.669
IN MY FIVE YEARS THAT WE REALLY

01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:44.471
FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE DE

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.707
DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW.

01:45:46.773 --> 01:45:47.741
I WHETHER IT'S RETROACTIVE OR

01:45:47.808 --> 01:45:52.713
NOT THIS WAS IN REGARDS -- TO A

01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:54.514
BILL.

01:45:54.581 --> 01:45:55.315
I HAD DEFECTED HAVE ON HEALTH

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:57.718
PLANS -- AND THERE THE HEALTH

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:58.618
PLAN SAID IT WOULD THAT IS NOT

01:45:58.685 --> 01:45:59.252
EXISTING LONG OTHER SAID IT IS

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:00.220
EXISTING LAW AND SO THERE IS A

01:46:00.287 --> 01:46:01.555
BILL THAT SAID WE'RE GONNA MAKE

01:46:01.621 --> 01:46:03.390
THIS EXISTING LAW OKAY -- IT'S

01:46:03.457 --> 01:46:05.325
SEEN HAPPEN IT SEEMS TO BE WELL

01:46:05.392 --> 01:46:06.526
I'D OF HAD HAVING TO LEAVE

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:08.295
BECAUSE I GOT CALLED DOWN --

01:46:08.361 --> 01:46:10.363
DOWN BELOW OF COURSE -- WITH --

01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:12.099
WITH YOU -- SO I DO ACTUALLY

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:13.700
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE END UP

01:46:13.767 --> 01:46:14.835
HAPPENING I'M GUESSING.

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:16.069
WELL I'M GUESSING THE BILL MIGHT

01:46:16.136 --> 01:46:17.471
HAVE MOVE MIGHT HAVE MOVED

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:21.041
FORWARD.

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:24.144
I THAT THAT SO THAT.

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.079
AND THE RIGHT WITH A GREAT DEAL

01:46:26.146 --> 01:46:28.115
OF THAT.

01:46:28.181 --> 01:46:29.049
WHICH IS OKAY BUT RIGHT SO THE

01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:30.150
QUESTION BEFORE US TODAY IS THAT

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:30.751
OF WHAT IS RETROACTIVE AND IF

01:46:30.817 --> 01:46:32.352
NOT IF THE LAW IS WHAT THE LAW

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:34.387
IS THERE SHOULD BE NO QUESTION

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:35.689
ABOUT IT.

01:46:35.756 --> 01:46:37.491
SO WHY DO WE HAVE TO DECLARE

01:46:37.557 --> 01:46:39.426
THAT IT'S EXISTING LAW AND I'D

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:41.628
ACTUALLY LIKE TO HEAR -- BECAUSE

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:42.996
I HAVE NOT HEARD THIS GENTLEMAN

01:46:43.063 --> 01:46:44.097
IS THE ATTORNEY ARMS THE

01:46:44.164 --> 01:46:45.665
OPPOSITION SEEMS TO BE VERY

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:47.567
KNOWLEDGEABLE OFTHIS I'D LIKE

01:46:47.634 --> 01:46:48.969
TO HEAR FROM YOU I'D LIKE TO

01:46:49.035 --> 01:46:50.470
HEAR FROM THE CONSULTANTS AND

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:53.006
I'D ALSO LIKE TO HEAR -- FROM

01:46:53.073 --> 01:46:54.741
THE ATTORNEY ONE MORE TIME ON

01:46:54.808 --> 01:46:57.277
WILL WHY ISN'T THE LAW CLEAR AND

01:46:57.344 --> 01:46:59.079
WHY WOULD WE HAVE TO DECLARE IT

01:46:59.146 --> 01:47:01.848
TO BE SO IF IT ISN'T CLEAR

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:03.383
ALREADY.

01:47:03.450 --> 01:47:04.151
WHAT THE THE AS IT'S BEEN SAID

01:47:04.217 --> 01:47:05.385
BAIL IS REGULATED BY THE

01:47:05.452 --> 01:47:06.586
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THERE'S

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:08.288
REGULATIONS IT'S VERY SPECIFIC

01:47:08.355 --> 01:47:10.524
AND THE BAIL AGENTS -- AND THE

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:11.258
INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL

01:47:11.324 --> 01:47:12.826
GENERALLY JUST LOOK TO THOSE

01:47:12.893 --> 01:47:13.894
BECAUSE THE COURT CASES HAVE

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.962
BEEN CLEAR THAT THESE CONSUMER

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:17.430
PROTECTION LAWS DON'T APPLY TO

01:47:17.497 --> 01:47:18.932
INSURANCE PRODUCTS.

01:47:18.999 --> 01:47:21.902
AND SO -- BAIL FINANCING ITSELF

01:47:21.968 --> 01:47:23.170
WHICH IS REALLY THE CAUSE OF

01:47:23.236 --> 01:47:24.271
THIS IS ONLY SOMETHING THAT'S

01:47:24.337 --> 01:47:26.239
OCCURRED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:29.342
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S BEEN NECESSARY

01:47:29.409 --> 01:47:30.243
NOW THE RATES OF AND SO HIGHS OF

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:31.845
THIS IS KIND OF A PROBLEM.

01:47:31.912 --> 01:47:34.114
THAT CONTINUES TO OCCUR BECAUSE

01:47:34.181 --> 01:47:35.682
THEY'RE JUST MORE MONEY AT STAKE

01:47:35.749 --> 01:47:37.551
THEY GET SOMEONE OUT OF JAIL

01:47:37.617 --> 01:47:38.418
THEY STILL WANT TO GET THEM OUT

01:47:38.485 --> 01:47:40.120
OF JAIL AND AND IT REALLY

01:47:40.187 --> 01:47:42.589
COMPLICATES THAT COOPERATION

01:47:42.656 --> 01:47:44.524
THAT THAT BAIL AGENTS NEED --

01:47:44.591 --> 01:47:45.759
FROM THE INTENDED THERE'S TO GET

01:47:45.826 --> 01:47:47.127
THE DEFENDANTS TO COURT WHEN

01:47:47.194 --> 01:47:51.665
THEY HAVE THESE -- IF I CAN BE

01:47:51.731 --> 01:47:52.232
CLEAR JUST TO BECAUSE A GUY

01:47:52.299 --> 01:47:54.167
DIDN'T SO OF THESE ITEMS ONE TWO

01:47:54.234 --> 01:47:56.069
THREE AND FOUR AND FIVE IS THAT

01:47:56.136 --> 01:47:57.070
EXISTING LAW.

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:59.039
WELL THAT NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE

01:47:59.105 --> 01:48:00.774
THAT THE APPLICATION OF ANY OF

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.475
THOSE ROLES IS EXISTING LAW

01:48:02.542 --> 01:48:05.045
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG STATEMENTS

01:48:05.111 --> 01:48:06.446
BY THE COURTS THAT INSURANCE

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.348
PRODUCTS ARE NOT CONTROLLED.

01:48:08.415 --> 01:48:10.350
BY THOSE LAWS IN THE PALE AS

01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:12.352
PRIMARY IS IS IS IS AN INSURANCE

01:48:12.419 --> 01:48:13.587
BROCADE GREAT SO I DON'T THINK

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:15.255
THAT THE GREAT THANK YOU AND AND

01:48:15.322 --> 01:48:17.891
MA'AM IF YOU CAN -- DRESS THOSE

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:18.458
FIVE ARE THOSE FIVE EAST OF

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:20.594
THOSE FIVE ITEMS BEFORE US IS

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:22.229
THAT A MATTER OF EXISTING LAW.

01:48:22.295 --> 01:48:23.997
YEAH THE FIVE ITEMS ARE EXISTING

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:25.599
LAW WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS

01:48:25.665 --> 01:48:27.667
INSERT BUT THEY APPLIED TO THE

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:32.739
BAIL AND IMMIGRATION BONDS

01:48:32.806 --> 01:48:34.441
INDUSTRIES.

01:48:34.507 --> 01:48:36.343
I'M SORRY YOU JUST SAID THE WILL

01:48:36.409 --> 01:48:38.545
IT WOULD SAY THAT THEY APPLY TO

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:39.045
HAVE THEM.

01:48:39.112 --> 01:48:39.913
THAT WOULD THAT WOULD THEN I'D

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:40.513
HAVE TO STE TO THINK THAT IT

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:41.114
DOESN'T APPLY TO THEM TODAY.

01:48:41.181 --> 01:48:43.049
AND THE ONLY REASON WE'RE HERE

01:48:43.116 --> 01:48:44.784
AND HAVING TO SPEND THE TIME ON

01:48:44.851 --> 01:48:45.418
THIS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SAYING

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:49.522
THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY

01:48:49.589 --> 01:48:50.357
ARE ENGAGING IN.

01:48:50.423 --> 01:48:53.126
ACTIVITY IS THAT THOSE LAWS SEEK

01:48:53.193 --> 01:48:54.661
TO REGULATE THAT THEY APPLY TO

01:48:54.728 --> 01:48:56.696
SO I JUST WANT TO SAY.

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:59.599
AS AS WAS JUST MENTIONED THE

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:01.067
FINANCING OF PREMIUMS RIGHT

01:49:01.134 --> 01:49:02.602
CREDIT BAIL IS SOMETHING THAT

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.337
ONLY STARTED HAPPENING OVER THE

01:49:04.404 --> 01:49:08.441
LAST FEW YEARS AS NECESSARY.

01:49:08.508 --> 01:49:09.509
DO I CREATE A SENSE ABOUT.

01:49:09.576 --> 01:49:10.543
BECAUSE PEOPLE COULDN'T PAY THE

01:49:10.610 --> 01:49:12.479
ENTIRE PREMIUMS UP FRONT AND I

01:49:12.545 --> 01:49:14.514
HAVE HEARD AND READ THE BAIL

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:15.682
AGENTS DID NOT WANT TO DO THAT.

01:49:15.749 --> 01:49:16.716
THEY DON'T WANT TO BE EXTENDING

01:49:16.783 --> 01:49:18.418
CREDIT BUT THEY ARE AND WHEN

01:49:18.485 --> 01:49:19.486
THEY STARTED DOING THAT THEY

01:49:19.552 --> 01:49:20.921
OPEN THEMSELVES UP TO THE

01:49:20.987 --> 01:49:23.657
APPLICATION OF A LOT MORE LAWS.

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.725
AND THEY SHOULD HAVE STARTED

01:49:25.792 --> 01:49:26.960
LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:28.328
DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.696
REGULATIONS WHEN THEY STARTED

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:31.264
ENGAGING IN CONDUCT THAT WAS NOT

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:33.433
REGULATED BY THOSE REGULATIONS

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:35.001
AND LOOK TO THE LAWS THAT DEAD

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:36.303
OKAY I'M GONNA GO TO A NEUTRAL

01:49:36.369 --> 01:49:42.475
PARTY -- TO THE CONSULTANT -- IN

01:49:42.542 --> 01:49:44.277
PARTICULAR AS APPLICATION OF THE

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:48.214
POINTS IN THE ANALYSIS THE BILL.

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:51.284
PROVIDE THEM OUT FOR DISTINCT

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:53.053
CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS.

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:56.523
SHALL APPLY TO BAIL AND DECLARES

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:57.924
THAT TO BE EXISTING LAW.

01:49:57.991 --> 01:49:59.859
SO. THREE OF THE FOUR ONE A

01:49:59.926 --> 01:50:02.162
SEPARATED OUT THREE OF THOSE

01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:04.965
FOUR LAWS GOVERN THE TRANSACTION

01:50:05.031 --> 01:50:06.666
AT ITS INCEPTION.

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:07.968
THAT IS DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT

01:50:08.034 --> 01:50:09.502
IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES IF OR IN A

01:50:09.569 --> 01:50:10.670
DIFFERENT LANGUAGE OF THE PERSON

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.305
SPEAKS A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE DO

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:13.106
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PARTICULAR

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.942
NOTICE CONSUMER CREDIT THING SO.

01:50:16.009 --> 01:50:18.378
AS TO THREE OF THE FOUR

01:50:18.445 --> 01:50:20.113
PROVISIONS IN THE BILL.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:22.882
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION OF WHAT

01:50:22.949 --> 01:50:24.551
IT IS INSIDE THE FOUR CORNERS.

01:50:24.617 --> 01:50:25.986
OF THE DOCUMENT THE BILL DOESN'T

01:50:26.052 --> 01:50:27.654
REGULATE THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.522
DOCTRINE FOR INSTANCE.

01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:30.256
THE SEARCH AND SEIZURE STUFF

01:50:30.323 --> 01:50:31.725
THAT THE CENTER SPOKE ABOUT THE

01:50:31.791 --> 01:50:33.293
BILL DOESN'T PURPORT. TO

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:35.462
REGULATE THAT STUFF IT SAYS AT

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:37.163
THE INCEPTION OF THE CONTRACT

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:38.131
YOU HAVE TO HAVE DONE CERTAIN

01:50:38.198 --> 01:50:40.333
THINGS SO WHEN WE GET TO THE

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:42.635
DECLARATORY OF EXISTING LAW.

01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:44.471
WHAT WAR PURPORTING TO DO WHEN

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.740
ALL ADDRESSED THAT RETROACTIVE

01:50:46.806 --> 01:50:49.376
DECLARATORY NEW ONES IN A SECOND --

01:50:49.442 --> 01:50:51.478
BUT WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THINGS

01:50:51.544 --> 01:50:52.012
THAT SHOULD HAVE ALREADY

01:50:52.078 --> 01:50:53.880
HAPPENED NOBODY CAN GO BACK AND

01:50:53.947 --> 01:50:55.815
CHANGE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN SO WE

01:50:55.882 --> 01:50:58.284
DECLARED TO BE THE EXISTING LAW

01:50:58.351 --> 01:50:59.719
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS.

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:03.490
THEY VIOLATED THE LAW BACK THEN.

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:04.124
IN THIS BUT WE CAN DO ABOUT IT

01:51:04.190 --> 01:51:05.091
NOW TO CHANGE INTO WHETHER

01:51:05.158 --> 01:51:06.826
THERE'S ONE LAWSUIT OR TWO

01:51:06.893 --> 01:51:07.827
LAWSUITS.

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:08.995
EVERY TRANSACTION THAT WAS

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:11.297
CONSUMMATED IN THE PAST WILL BE

01:51:11.364 --> 01:51:12.065
SUBJECT.

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:13.366
TO YOU DIDN'T DO THE THING AT

01:51:13.433 --> 01:51:15.035
THE TIME THE CONTRACT WAS

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:16.102
ENTERED INTO.

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:17.904
THE FOURTH ONE IS THE CAN IT IS

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:20.807
THE DEBT COLLECTION ACT -- AND

01:51:20.874 --> 01:51:22.342
IF THE BILL WERE ENACTED WITH

01:51:22.409 --> 01:51:23.443
THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED

01:51:23.510 --> 01:51:24.744
AMENDMENTS EVEN THOUGH THE

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:26.212
CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO IN THE

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:27.380
PAST.

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.349
THE BEHAVIOR OF DEBT COLLECTION

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:32.318
WOULD BE OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:33.686
ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THAT

01:51:33.753 --> 01:51:34.921
WOULD APPLY TO CURRENT.

01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:36.556
BAR SKEWS ME THAT WOULD APPLY TO

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.725
PREVIOUSLY ENTERED INTO

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.727
CONTRACTS -- STE SO THE QUESTION

01:51:40.794 --> 01:51:42.328
THEN IS IT IS IF IT'S

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:43.897
RETROACTIVE A WE AUTOMATICALLY

01:51:43.963 --> 01:51:45.398
SAYING GOTCHA TO TRANSACTIONS

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:46.766
THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CONSUMMATED

01:51:46.833 --> 01:51:48.001
AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS YES

01:51:48.068 --> 01:51:49.235
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.

01:51:49.302 --> 01:51:50.904
RETROACTIVE IN DECLARATORY OF

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:52.906
EXISTING LAW.

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:54.340
LAWYER GEEK NEW ONES.

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:54.974
IF I COULD SIT DOWN WITH LEAD

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.276
COUNSEL I COULD HAVE A DEBATE

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:57.610
ABOUT WHAT'S TECHNICALLY

01:51:57.677 --> 01:51:58.711
RETROACTIVE AND WHAT'S

01:51:58.778 --> 01:52:00.547
TECHNICALLY DECLARATORY OF

01:52:00.613 --> 01:52:01.081
EXISTING LAW.

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:05.351
AS A PRACTICAL POLICY MATTER.

01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:06.419
WE SAY DECLARATORY OF EXISTING

01:52:06.486 --> 01:52:08.755
LAW TO TRY TO NEW WANTS

01:52:08.822 --> 01:52:10.123
RETROACTIVITY AND THAT'S WHAT IT.

01:52:10.190 --> 01:52:13.726
WOULD DO HERE -- IF IF IT WAS

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:14.327
LEFT IN THE BILL IN THE BILL

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:15.795
WERE ENACTED.

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.897
IN IF IS THAT ACCURATE.

01:52:17.964 --> 01:52:19.199
I THINK THAT WAS PRETTY ACCURATE.

01:52:19.265 --> 01:52:20.033
YES VERY.

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:21.768
CAN I ADD ONE THING THOUGH ABOUT

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.169
THAT CONCERNED WITH THE

01:52:23.236 --> 01:52:25.205
AMENDMENT AROUND IT THE THIS

01:52:25.271 --> 01:52:28.274
RETROACTIVITY CONVERSATION.

01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:29.476
THAT IT SHOULD ONLY GO INTO

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:32.178
EFFECT FOR TRANSACTIONS AFTER.

01:52:32.245 --> 01:52:34.781
JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY WHICH

01:52:34.848 --> 01:52:36.149
IS THE SUGGEST THESE MAIN POINT

01:52:36.216 --> 01:52:38.384
YOU MAKE YOUR POINT OKAY SO IF

01:52:38.451 --> 01:52:39.519
THAT IS THE CASE IF WE WERE TO

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:40.820
TAKE THAT AMENDMENT AND SAY THAT

01:52:40.887 --> 01:52:41.955
THESE ONLY APPLY GOING FORWARD

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:42.822
THEN THE BAIL BONDS AND

01:52:42.889 --> 01:52:44.257
IMMIGRATION BONDS INDUSTRIES

01:52:44.324 --> 01:52:45.592
FREE TO SUE.

01:52:45.658 --> 01:52:47.093
EVERYBODY WHO HAS OUTSTANDING

01:52:47.160 --> 01:52:48.428
DEBT WHO FALLS BEHIND ON

01:52:48.495 --> 01:52:49.696
PAYMENTS AND THEY CAN NOT ASSERT

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:51.364
THOSE LAWS IN THEIR DEFENSE AS

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.999
WE HAVE DONE AND MISS ELITES

01:52:53.066 --> 01:52:54.667
CASE THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE

01:52:54.734 --> 01:52:56.069
BENEFIT OF THOSE LAWS THAT IT

01:52:56.136 --> 01:52:58.605
SAYS THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO

01:52:58.671 --> 01:52:59.639
TRANSACTIONS.

01:52:59.706 --> 01:53:01.040
PRIOR TO TWENTY BUT THAT IS

01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:03.309
ARKAN MAJOR CONCERN.

01:53:03.376 --> 01:53:04.477
ABOUT THAT AMENDMENT.

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:05.645
FIRST OF ALL THAT MEMBERS DON'T

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:07.147
SAY CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO ON OR

01:53:07.213 --> 01:53:08.982
AFTER AND IF THAT IS IN FACT

01:53:09.048 --> 01:53:12.085
YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT'S DRAFTING

01:53:12.152 --> 01:53:13.853
ISSUE NOT POLICIES THANK YOU.

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:15.355
ALL RIGHTS OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS

01:53:15.421 --> 01:53:16.356
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR

01:53:16.422 --> 01:53:17.957
COMMENTS WITHOUT A VERY THOROUGH

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.025
DISCUSSION.

01:53:19.092 --> 01:53:24.097
MR COOLEY.

01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:27.567
COME BACK I MEAN I ON POLICY.

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:29.302
I JUST KNOW WHAT ARE WE DOING ON

01:53:29.369 --> 01:53:30.904
POLICY THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.805
IN THEIR DIGEST GIVES US FIVE

01:53:32.872 --> 01:53:34.073
PIECES.

01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.909
SO THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL

01:53:35.975 --> 01:53:38.144
DEALS WITH PERSONS TRANSACTION

01:53:38.211 --> 01:53:39.245
BIZ WITH PURSES.

01:53:39.312 --> 01:53:41.881
HISPANIC WHO SPEAK PRIMARILY

01:53:41.948 --> 01:53:44.083
SPANISH CHINESE TACKLE

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:45.084
VIETNAMESE KOREAN.

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:45.885
AND WE ACTUALLY GOING TO THAT

01:53:45.952 --> 01:53:48.621
BODY LONG WE CHANGE THE RULES

01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:50.290
EXTENDED THE VEIL.

01:53:50.356 --> 01:53:51.558
IT IS IN THE FORM OF CHANGE.

01:53:51.624 --> 01:53:53.026
OTHER CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES

01:53:53.092 --> 01:53:54.961
ACT AGAIN WE MAY CONFIRM OF

01:53:55.028 --> 01:53:56.262
CHANGE.

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.964
TERRIFYING THE LAWS APPLICATION

01:53:58.031 --> 01:54:00.967
WE HAVE WE'RE ADDING VERBIAGE TO

01:54:01.034 --> 01:54:02.168
THAT STATUTE.

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:03.803
WE THEN HAVE THE THIRD POINT

01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:06.005
ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:06.639
PRACTICES ACT.

01:54:06.706 --> 01:54:08.641
AND NEW HERSCHEL ROSENTHAL HIS

01:54:08.708 --> 01:54:11.578
WIFE -- IN MY CAREER.

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:15.582
THEN WE HAVE THE CONSUMER CREDIT

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:16.416
CONTRACT LAW.

01:54:16.482 --> 01:54:18.351
SO IN EACH OF THESE LAWS WE ARE

01:54:18.418 --> 01:54:19.953
IN FACT MAKING SUBSTANTIVE

01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:22.889
CHANGES. TO WRITE THIS BUSINESS

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:23.656
AND DO IT.

01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:24.958
AND I DON'T THINK I'M HERE IN AN

01:54:25.024 --> 01:54:26.593
ARGUMENT WITH THOSE SUBS OF

01:54:26.659 --> 01:54:29.362
CHANGES IN NORTH THOSE FOR LAWS.

01:54:29.429 --> 01:54:30.997
THE REAL ISSUE IS THE FIFTH

01:54:31.064 --> 01:54:32.932
PROVISION OF ALLEGED COUNCIL

01:54:32.999 --> 01:54:33.933
DIED YES.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:35.101
THE BILL WAS STATE THAT ALL THE

01:54:35.168 --> 01:54:36.903
CHANGES SPECIFIED ABOVE ALL OF

01:54:36.970 --> 01:54:40.306
THE CHANGES SPECIFIED ABOVE.

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:42.208
ARCTIC TERRITORY JUST IN LAW.

01:54:42.275 --> 01:54:43.543
SO TO ME IT'S LIKE FOUR FIFTHS

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:44.143
OF THE BILL.

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.712
ARE NOT OBJECTIONABLE ON A GO

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:47.347
FORWARD BASIS WE ARE REWRITING

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:49.549
THE RULES THAT'S HOW IT'S

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:54.020
EXPLAINED IT'S ONLY THIS THE

01:54:54.087 --> 01:54:55.622
CHARACTERIZATION LOS WHY.

01:54:55.688 --> 01:54:56.889
I CONTINUE TO THINK THAT.

01:54:56.956 --> 01:54:59.525
WE WE HAVE A BILL THAT.

01:54:59.592 --> 01:55:02.629
IT CAN BE READILY PASSED IT'S

01:55:02.695 --> 01:55:02.929
JUST THAT.

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:04.397
FINAL PROVISION.

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:08.034
IN THE DIGESTIVE TORTURES OF

01:55:08.101 --> 01:55:10.270
FLAWS OVERREACH.

01:55:10.336 --> 01:55:11.004
IN JUST A COOPER IS REAL QUICK

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:12.505
AND MEMBERS SB FOURTEEN TWENTY

01:55:12.572 --> 01:55:13.139
ONE THE PEACE OFFICERS RECORDS

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:13.339
BILL.

01:55:13.406 --> 01:55:15.141
NEVER SAID RETROACTIVITY IN

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:16.409
THERE WHATSOEVER.

01:55:16.476 --> 01:55:17.610
WHAT THE COURT THE COURTS HAVE

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:19.279
DECLARED ITS RETRO?

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:20.647
NEVER SAID IN THE BILL.

01:55:20.713 --> 01:55:23.316
SO IF WE DON'T SPECIFIED HERE.

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:26.085
IT'S OPEN TO DEBATE.

01:55:26.152 --> 01:55:27.220
AND FOR FOR COURT FINDING.

01:55:27.287 --> 01:55:29.555
AND THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE

01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:30.156
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE LAST YEAR

01:55:30.223 --> 01:55:31.958
PEACE OFFICER RECORDS.

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.159
NEVER SAID RETRO BUT IT IS BEING

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:35.228
APPLIED RETROACTIVELY SO IT'S

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:37.230
GOING TO BE SPELLED OUT.

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:38.164
RIGHT CAN I JUST MAKE CLIP

01:55:38.231 --> 01:55:38.765
OCCASIONS GERMAN IT MIGHT BE

01:55:38.831 --> 01:55:40.066
VENTURE BECAUSE I HAVE THE

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:40.633
GREATEST CONFIDENCE IN YOU

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.501
PERSONALLY IN.

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:42.835
RELATIONSHIPS ARE IMPORTANT

01:55:42.902 --> 01:55:44.003
ISSUES ARE TOUGH AND I

01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:45.805
APPRECIATE THAT THIS ASSEMBLY --

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:47.106
MAYES ON THE NATURE THIS

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:48.041
COMMITTEE BECAUSE THIS IS

01:55:48.107 --> 01:55:50.376
EXACTLY WHAT I LIKE TO DO TO IF

01:55:50.443 --> 01:55:50.943
YOU COULD TELL.

01:55:51.010 --> 01:55:52.045
SO I APPRECIATE AS WAS

01:55:52.111 --> 01:55:53.446
LEGISLATIVE BODIES ARE ABOUT.

01:55:53.513 --> 01:55:55.648
BUT IF AGE AS WAS INDICATED BY

01:55:55.715 --> 01:55:57.016
YOUR CHIEF CONSULTANT THIS IS A

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:58.384
DRAFTING PART WHICH I THINK IT

01:55:58.451 --> 01:55:59.719

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:00.887
A WAY AROUND THIS THAT UNDER THE

01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:15.194
IF YOU'RE SILENT ON THE COURT?

01:57:15.261 --> 01:57:16.295
IT'S SILENT YOU'RE ACTUALLY

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:17.230
MAKING A STATEMENT WHEN THERE'S

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:19.065
A JUSTICE AND YOU DON'T CALL IT

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:21.000
OUT YOU'RE MAKING A STATEMENT

01:57:21.067 --> 01:57:22.502
WHAT BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU.

01:57:22.568 --> 01:57:23.469
YOU SAY WHAT YOU WANT BUT I

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:24.704
PROMISE YOU IN THE COURT

01:57:24.771 --> 01:57:26.406
PROCEEDINGS LIKE I HAVE BEFORE

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:26.973
YOUR THE COMPLAINT THE LEGAL

01:57:27.039 --> 01:57:28.508
DOCUMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO COME

01:57:28.574 --> 01:57:30.243
IN AND USE EVERY ARGUMENT

01:57:30.309 --> 01:57:31.310
THEY'RE GOING TO USE. TO

01:57:31.377 --> 01:57:33.212
SUBSTANTIATE THEIR POSITION

01:57:33.279 --> 01:57:34.247
THEY'RE GONNA SAY SEE THE

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:36.983
LEGISLATURE MADE NO COMMENT AND

01:57:37.049 --> 01:57:37.950
HENCE THEY CLEARLY DOESN'T MEAN

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.318
BECAUSE THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:40.920
TO EXTEND THIS AND THEY DIDN'T

01:57:40.987 --> 01:57:49.829
SO THE FACT THAT THIS BILL PUTS

01:57:49.896 --> 01:57:51.364
US IN THAT POSITION.

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.031
SO I'M TRYING TO GET TIME WE CAN

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:54.400
GET PAST THIS AND WORK TOGETHER

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:55.234
WITH THE COMMITTEE TRY TO DRAFT

01:57:55.301 --> 01:57:55.401
IT.

01:57:55.468 --> 01:57:57.437
I THINK THE MAJORITY WHOSE POINT

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.138
PRETTY CLEAR.

01:57:59.205 --> 01:58:01.507
WHY NOT THEN A SERVER EXCEPT TO

01:58:01.574 --> 01:58:02.708
AMENDMENT SEE?

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:03.376
IT SAYS NO ACTIONS TAKEN ON THIS

01:58:03.443 --> 01:58:04.010
BILL ARE INTENDED TO INFLUENCE

01:58:04.076 --> 01:58:04.577
LITIGATION SEEKING TO APPLY

01:58:04.644 --> 01:58:06.078
THESE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:06.679
BAIL AND SO FORTH.

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:07.747
WHY IS THAT A?

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:14.253
WHY NOT ACCEPT THAT?

01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:18.391
THIS IS A WELL I'M JUST LIMITING

01:58:18.458 --> 01:58:19.692
THE BILL LANGUAGE INSTEAD OF A

01:58:19.759 --> 01:58:21.093
SUMMARY HANG ON THE CHANGE WAS A

01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:22.829
MEMBER.

01:58:22.895 --> 01:58:24.330
WELL IT DOESN'T REALLY SAY THAT

01:58:24.397 --> 01:58:25.698
WHAT IT SAYS THAT THAT'S A

01:58:25.765 --> 01:58:27.867
SUMMARY THAT'SNOT CONSISTENT

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:28.568
WITH THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:28.868
AMENDMENT.

01:58:28.935 --> 01:58:30.603
THE AMENDMENT SAYS SPECIFICALLY

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.472
THE OPPOSITE IN MY READING IT'S

01:58:32.538 --> 01:58:34.440
A THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS ACT

01:58:34.507 --> 01:58:36.409
DO NOT APPLY IN ANY MANNER AND

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.577
IN IS NOT THE INTENT THE

01:58:37.643 --> 01:58:40.146
LEGISLATURE TO TO AFFECT THIS.

01:58:40.213 --> 01:58:42.014
WE DON'T WANT TO OF WE WANT WHAT

01:58:42.081 --> 01:58:42.782
THE COURT MOVE THE WAY THE COURT

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:43.483
MOVES.

01:58:43.549 --> 01:58:44.750
THAT I WOULD I INTERPRET THAT

01:58:44.817 --> 01:58:46.352
WHEN I READ IT THE REASON I SAID

01:58:46.419 --> 01:58:48.154
NO IS WERE IN FACT BEING GIVEN A

01:58:48.221 --> 01:58:49.555
LEG UP IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S

01:58:49.622 --> 01:58:51.023
NEUTRAL BUT IT'S NOT.

01:58:51.090 --> 01:58:52.258
BECAUSE IF I WAS A JUDGE IN OUR

01:58:52.325 --> 01:58:53.659
MEETING A CASE WELL THE

01:58:53.726 --> 01:58:56.462
LEGISLATURE CLEARLY DIDN'T HAVE

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.297
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

01:58:58.364 --> 01:58:59.165
YOU KNOW DON'T FORGET THINK

01:58:59.232 --> 01:58:59.832
ABOUT WERE ACT OKAY THESE PEOPLE

01:58:59.899 --> 01:59:01.601
HERE TODAY ARE SAYING TO THEM

01:59:01.667 --> 01:59:04.136
THE INDUSTRY WE'RE OK WITH THIS

01:59:04.203 --> 01:59:05.304
BUT HISTORICALLY THEY SAID WE

01:59:05.371 --> 01:59:07.273
NEVER WORLD QUE THEY'VE CHANGED

01:59:07.340 --> 01:59:08.474
THEIR POSITION ON THE FIRST FIVE

01:59:08.541 --> 01:59:09.575
POINTS.

01:59:09.642 --> 01:59:11.177
THAT A GERMAN COOLEY MENTION

01:59:11.244 --> 01:59:12.411
OKAY THEY'VE CHANGE YOUR

01:59:12.478 --> 01:59:13.546
POSITION THERE'S NO QUESTION

01:59:13.613 --> 01:59:14.981
ABOUT THE CHANGE OF POSITION IN

01:59:15.047 --> 01:59:16.382
EVERY PROCEEDING WHEN I WAS

01:59:16.449 --> 01:59:17.717
DOING THE OTHER BILL.

01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:18.951
EVERYTHING THEY SAID WAS THIS

01:59:19.018 --> 01:59:20.086
DOESN'T APPLY HERTZBERG YOU KNOW

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:21.120
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:59:21.187 --> 01:59:22.221
NOW THEY'RE FLIPPING IN SAYING

01:59:22.288 --> 01:59:24.390
THEY DO BUT THEY'RE SCARED ABOUT

01:59:24.457 --> 01:59:26.859
THIS NOTION OF RETROACTIVITY

01:59:26.926 --> 01:59:28.261
OKAY GET IT.

01:59:28.327 --> 01:59:29.562
SO THE DELICATE DANCE IS TO

01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:31.497
BASICALLY MAKE SURE ADDS WERE

01:59:31.564 --> 01:59:33.065
CONSIDERING THIS.

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:34.700
WE DON'T ADVERSITY CASE ONE WAY

01:59:34.767 --> 01:59:36.068
OR THE OTHER AND I JUST SUGGEST

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:37.603
THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS HERE

01:59:37.670 --> 01:59:39.171
SAYING THIS ISN'T THE INTENT.

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:40.306
THE INTENT LEGISLATURE IS THAT

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:41.774
THAT WE ALWAYS INTENDED THIS TO

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:42.441
BE THE CASE I DON'T THINK THAT'S

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:44.243
A QUESTION I THINK ANY MEMBER

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:46.112
HERE WANTS TO DEFRAUD PEOPLE OR

01:59:46.178 --> 01:59:47.346
HAVE THEIR CONTRACTS AND THERE'S

01:59:47.413 --> 01:59:48.881
A THERE'S A BLURRING BETWEEN THE

01:59:48.948 --> 01:59:50.283
INSURANCE INDUSTRY.

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:52.184
AND THE FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS.

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.419
THOSE APPROVAL THOSE POINTS OF

01:59:53.486 --> 01:59:54.587
THAT WHICH MADE EARLIER ABOUT

01:59:54.654 --> 01:59:55.421
THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER

01:59:55.488 --> 01:59:56.856
HAVING APPROVE OF COURSE THE

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:57.323
APPROVED THE INSURANCE

01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:58.324
RELATIONSHIP.

01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:59.959
BUT THEN THERE'S A SUBSEQUENT

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.427
TRANSACTION WHICH IS THE

02:00:01.494 --> 02:00:03.963
FINANCING SIDE AND THEY SAY THAT --

02:00:04.030 --> 02:00:06.232
WHEN THERE'S NO INTEREST BUT

02:00:06.299 --> 02:00:07.800
THERE'S SO MANY FEES AND SO MANY

02:00:07.867 --> 02:00:10.002
CHARGES AND SO MANY THINGS THAT

02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:11.404
THROUGHOUT THE INDUSTRY AND HOW

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.673
THE JURISPRUDENTIAL DYNAMIC OF

02:00:13.739 --> 02:00:15.041
OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ARE

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.342
INFORMED TO BE?

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:18.544
CHARGES AND YOU HAVE SITUATIONS

02:00:18.611 --> 02:00:19.445
WE HAVE CASE I CAN BRING THEM

02:00:19.512 --> 02:00:21.113
BEFORE YOU WERE SEVEN FIVE

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:22.481

FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

02:00:23.282 --> 02:00:24.850
BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF THAT

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:25.985
WAS OTHERWISE INFORMED ABOUT IT

02:00:26.052 --> 02:00:28.487
AND SO THAT THAT TO ME IS THE

02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:29.689
QUESTION AND THEN WE'RE I THINK

02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:30.289
WE'RE OBJECTIVE IS THE SAME I

02:00:30.356 --> 02:00:31.891
THINK YOUR POINT IS CORRECT.

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:33.292
AND IF WE CAN GET THERE I'D BE

02:00:33.359 --> 02:00:35.494
HAPPY TO DO IT LIKE TO MOVE IT

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:36.862

NOT GONNA TAKE IT UP IF IT

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:43.636
DIDN'T GET A PASS.

02:00:43.703 --> 02:00:44.937
COURSE COURSE ONE APPROACH IS TO

02:00:45.004 --> 02:00:46.272
ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS.

02:00:46.339 --> 02:00:47.640
AND THEN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:49.842
LANGUAGE IN THE AMENDMENTS

02:00:49.909 --> 02:00:55.147

IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE

02:01:03.923 --> 02:01:05.458

THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BUT

02:05:42.801 --> 02:05:43.335

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:53.479
HOPING IT'S NOT NECESSARY I'VE

02:05:53.545 --> 02:05:54.413
HAD THOSE A COUPLE BILLS IN THE

02:05:54.480 --> 02:05:55.347
SENATE BECAUSE WE JUST HAVE

02:05:55.414 --> 02:05:56.849
ENOUGH TIME TO WORK ON IT.

02:05:56.916 --> 02:05:58.584

02:06:07.526 --> 02:06:08.727
AND I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE

02:06:08.794 --> 02:06:10.162
YOU KNOW I REALLY THINK THAT.

02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:11.597

02:06:11.664 --> 02:06:13.599
TO THE INDUSTRY YES THE ANSWER

02:06:13.666 --> 02:06:15.501

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:18.671
HAND -- ED AND BUT I JUST I

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:19.705
THINK THIS DISCUSSION SENDS A

02:06:19.772 --> 02:06:22.308
BIG MESSAGE TO THE INDUSTRY AS

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:23.375
TO CLEAN IT UP AT LEAST THAT THE

02:06:23.442 --> 02:06:24.810
BAIL AGENTS TO ENGAGE IN THIS

02:06:24.877 --> 02:06:25.945
BEHAVIOR TO CLEAN UP THEIR ACS

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:27.112
THAT'S ALL I WANT TO DO AND I'M

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:28.747
DEEPLY AFRAID.

02:06:28.814 --> 02:06:29.748
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE THIS

02:06:29.815 --> 02:06:31.150
THESE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:06:31.216 --> 02:06:32.751
FINANCING CONTRACTS OUT THERE

02:06:32.818 --> 02:06:34.219
AND PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY CAN

02:06:34.286 --> 02:06:34.887
BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAT'S MY

02:06:34.954 --> 02:06:36.388
CONCERN MISTER CHAIRMAN.

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:37.389
AND I THINK WE CAN GET AROUND

02:06:37.456 --> 02:06:38.524
THAT IN THE DRAFTING OF THE

02:06:38.590 --> 02:06:39.558
LANGUAGE TO ACHIEVE THE

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:40.859
OBJECTIVE SO WITH THAT.

02:06:40.926 --> 02:06:42.161
I THINK I I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF

02:06:42.227 --> 02:06:42.928
THINGS TO SAY BUT I THINK THAT

02:06:42.995 --> 02:06:44.029
MAKES MY CLOTHES BECAUSE YOU

02:06:44.096 --> 02:06:45.931

BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT.

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:34.640
PEOPLE AT RISK FOR SOMETHING

02:08:34.706 --> 02:08:36.075
THEY EXTENDED THEMSELVES FOR AND

I CAN'T SAY THAT EVERYBODY IN

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:38.811
THE BILL BONDS INDUSTRY.

02:08:38.877 --> 02:08:41.380
IS BAD.

OF COURSE NOT.

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:43.949

02:08:50.722 --> 02:08:52.458
BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:08:52.524 --> 02:08:53.592
WELL IF I WOULD ADD ONE MORE

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:55.661
SENTENCE IN RESPONSE TO A GERMAN

FRASIER'S COMMENTS HERE THAT IS

02:08:58.063 --> 02:08:59.798
IMPORTANT.

02:08:59.865 --> 02:09:02.501
THE REAL IN ON MY SENSE OF THE

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:04.236
ISSUE BEFORE US TODAY.

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.437
IS IT'S ONE OF IT'S THE ISSUE OF

02:09:05.504 --> 02:09:06.872
IGNORANCE OF THE LAW IS NO

02:09:06.939 --> 02:09:08.073
EXCUSE.

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:09.475
AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THE LAW

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:10.476
EXISTS.

02:09:10.542 --> 02:09:11.877
AND THE BILL INDUSTRY DIDN'T

02:09:11.944 --> 02:09:13.345
REALLY REALIZE IT RIGHT NOW

02:09:13.412 --> 02:09:14.179
THERE'S LITIGATION AGAINST THE

02:09:14.246 --> 02:09:15.280
BILL AS YOU FAN I TRUSTED

02:09:15.347 --> 02:09:17.449
REALIZED THE COLLUSION ON 10%

02:09:17.516 --> 02:09:18.617
WHICH ISN'T IN THE LAW.

02:09:18.684 --> 02:09:20.252
THEY'RE GOING TO GET NAILED

02:09:20.319 --> 02:09:21.053
BECAUSE THEY JUST IGNORED ABOUT

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:21.954
THE LAW.

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:23.722
AND THEY MOVED FROM BEING AN

02:09:23.789 --> 02:09:25.057
INSURANCE COMPANY TO A FINANCE

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.492
COMPANY AND DIDN'T REALIZE THE

02:09:26.558 --> 02:09:27.693
LAWS APPLY.

02:09:27.759 --> 02:09:29.294
IN THE SINGLE BIGGEST PROMISE OF

02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:30.929
WE ALL KNOW IS IGNORANCE OF THE

02:09:30.996 --> 02:09:32.131
LAW IS NO EXCUSE.

02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:34.032
WE ALL COULD COME WITH EXAMPLES

02:09:34.099 --> 02:09:34.700
TO THAT ANDTHAT'S REALLY WHAT'S

02:09:34.766 --> 02:09:36.735
GOING ON AND NOW THEY'RE SAYING

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:37.536
WELL WE DID KNOW ABOUT IT

02:09:37.603 --> 02:09:38.537
BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK IT REALLY

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:39.671

THE COURT ALREADY SAID IT

02:09:42.374 --> 02:09:43.909
APPLIED TO THEM SO I DON'T WANT

02:09:43.976 --> 02:09:46.245

02:11:12.598 --> 02:11:13.432
A MAJORITY LEADER PROPOSED AND

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:15.701

I I THINK THAT.

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:23.575
HONESTLY IS ONE I THINK AT AND

02:11:23.642 --> 02:11:25.477
TO THE AUTHOR QUITE A GREAT DEAL

02:11:25.544 --> 02:11:26.945
OF RESPECT FOR I DO THINK THAT.

02:11:27.012 --> 02:11:28.046
THE FIRST COMMENTS THAT WERE

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:29.481
MADE BY THE MAJORITY LEADER WAS

02:11:29.548 --> 02:11:30.816
IT WOULD BE CSUS SIMPLER CLEANER

02:11:30.882 --> 02:11:33.418
IF IF WEEK YOU ACCEPTED THE

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:35.087
AMENDMENTS AS A COMMITTEE STAFF.

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:36.989
PRESENTED HERE TODAY AND THEN

02:11:37.055 --> 02:11:38.557
CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE IN THAT

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.158
CONTEXT AND THAT LEVEL BECAUSE

02:11:40.225 --> 02:11:41.493
THAT WOULD CLEAR A LOT OF THE

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.128
DISCOMFORT THAT EXISTS AROUND

02:11:43.195 --> 02:11:44.229
THE TABLE AND PROBABLY GET A LOT

02:11:44.296 --> 02:11:45.464
OF AYE VOTES.

02:11:45.530 --> 02:11:47.099
IF YOU ACCEPTED THOSE ARE AND IT

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.867
WOULD BE BIPARTISAN AT THAT

02:11:48.934 --> 02:11:51.570
MOMENT I BELIEVE ARE AT LEAST

02:11:51.637 --> 02:11:54.306
WITH.

02:11:54.373 --> 02:11:55.407
ONE MISTER CHAIR BACK TO YOU

02:11:55.474 --> 02:11:56.708
RIGHT RIGHT OLD MAYBE YOU CAN

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:59.911
GET THAT CLARIFICATION.

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:03.315
I THINK THE CHALLENGE OF WITH

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:05.617
MISTER CALDERON NOTION.

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:09.154
IS THAT IT WILL LEAD TO A DEBATE.

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:11.323
ON THE ESOTERIC MEANINGS OF

02:12:11.390 --> 02:12:12.758
RETROACTIVITY.

02:12:12.824 --> 02:12:14.026
THAT'S TRUE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT

02:12:14.092 --> 02:12:16.595
JAMMIN ENERGY DEBATE ON EXACTLY

02:12:16.662 --> 02:12:18.630
WHAT LANGUAGE WE MAY ULTIMATELY

02:12:18.697 --> 02:12:20.599
ADOPT IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:23.335
MAY OR MAY NOT AFFECT THE JUDGE

02:12:23.402 --> 02:12:25.737
OR JUDGES IN THE CASE.

02:12:25.804 --> 02:12:27.172
THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT.

02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:28.473
WHICH GOES AGAIN TO

02:12:28.540 --> 02:12:32.878
RETROACTIVITY -- AND I DON'T

02:12:32.944 --> 02:12:35.514
KNOW IF THERE'S A A WISE PERSON

02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:38.417
WHO CAN MAKE THAT CALL -- YOU

02:12:38.483 --> 02:12:40.185
KNOW.

02:12:40.252 --> 02:12:41.887
YOU WON'T ACCEPT AMENDMENTS THAT

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:44.222
CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:45.924
RETROACTIVE.

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:48.260
AND YOU HAVE A REASON FOR THAT.

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:52.297
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT.

02:12:52.364 --> 02:12:54.900
IS YOU DON'T WANT. TO TELL THE

02:12:54.966 --> 02:12:58.036
COURT THAT WE'VE DECIDED.

02:12:58.103 --> 02:12:59.805
THAT IT SHALL NOT BE RETROACTIVE.

02:12:59.871 --> 02:13:00.972
THE LAW YOU WANT TO GO INTO

02:13:01.039 --> 02:13:05.010
EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST OF

02:13:05.077 --> 02:13:05.644
TWENTY TWENTY YOU DON'T WANT ANY

02:13:05.711 --> 02:13:06.345
NOTION.

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:11.783
THAT SOMEHOW -- AFFECTS THAT

02:13:11.850 --> 02:13:13.018
THAT CASE.

02:13:13.085 --> 02:13:14.820
BUT NO MATTER WHAT WE DO IT WILL

02:13:14.886 --> 02:13:16.722
AFFECT THAT CASE.

02:13:16.788 --> 02:13:18.090
WE'LL TRY HONOR WHAT WE OFFER

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.691
SUGGESTION WOULD ADDRESS THAT.

02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:21.293
BECAUSE THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.461
HAD IN OUR CONVERSATIONS YOUR

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.628
OFFICE IT WITHIN THE EXACT

02:13:23.695 --> 02:13:25.230
CONVERSATION TO CONSULT EXACTLY

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:27.366
WE'RE TRYING TO DO NOT AFFECT

02:13:27.432 --> 02:13:28.100
THE CASE.

02:13:28.166 --> 02:13:29.601
AND THE ARGUMENT YOU MADE ABOUT

02:13:29.668 --> 02:13:31.169
OUR EARLIER BILL AND YOUR THEIR

02:13:31.236 --> 02:13:32.604
DRAFT PASSED EVERYWHERE ELSE

02:13:32.671 --> 02:13:33.872
THAT AFFECTED THE CASE SO YOU

02:13:33.939 --> 02:13:34.806
SAID NOTHING YOU'RE CAN AFFECT

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:35.640
THE CASE.

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:37.275
YOU COULD WRITE THIS I THINK IN

02:13:37.342 --> 02:13:38.877
A WAY THAT IN THAT BASICALLY

02:13:38.944 --> 02:13:40.479
EXPRESSES THE DISCUSSION.

02:13:40.545 --> 02:13:41.847
THAT ON THE ONE HAND YOU CAN

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:43.014
SIMPLY WRITE THIS THE INTENT

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.349
LANGUAGE AND GIVE GUIDANCE TO

02:13:44.416 --> 02:13:45.450
THE COURT.

02:13:45.517 --> 02:13:46.585
THAT WE DIDN'T THAT ONE WAY

02:13:46.651 --> 02:13:47.486
THERE WAS THERE WAS A THERE WAS

02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:48.320
A A COULD STRUGGLE THERE WAS

02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:50.455
CONCERN ON THE ONE HAND WE ARGUE

02:13:50.522 --> 02:13:51.056
THAT IF WE SAID SOMETHING IT

02:13:51.123 --> 02:13:52.991
WOULD BE GREAT THIS ON THE OTHER

02:13:53.058 --> 02:13:54.092
HAND WE ARE THIS WE DON'T WANT

02:13:54.159 --> 02:13:54.893
TO SEND THIS THING COURT.

02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.294
CAN MAKE WHATEVER DETERMINATION

02:13:56.361 --> 02:13:59.131
WITHOUT CONSIDERATION AND THAT

02:13:59.197 --> 02:14:00.699
COULD ACTUALLY ABOVE ACHIEVE THE

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:05.570
THE THIS IS KIND OF A CONUNDRUM.

02:14:05.637 --> 02:14:07.472
BUT CONUNDRUMS ARE MADE TO BE

02:14:07.539 --> 02:14:09.040
SOLVED I THINK WE GOT A SHOT AT

02:14:13.645 --> 02:14:14.980
IF WE GIVE IT A SHOT IN IT YOU

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:16.648

02:14:16.715 --> 02:14:17.949
GO AND WE DON'T GET IT I'M NOT

02:14:18.016 --> 02:14:19.151
TAKING IT TO THE FLOOR IT'S JUST

02:14:19.217 --> 02:14:20.952
MADE THAT COMMITMENT.

02:14:21.019 --> 02:14:22.220
AND SO IT'S IT'S A IT'S A

02:14:22.287 --> 02:14:25.290
SITUATION WHERE -- AND YOU KNOW

02:28:14.852 --> 02:28:16.487
BEFORE I GET INTO THE MEAT OF

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:18.022
OUR REASONS FOR BEING OPPOSED TO

02:28:18.089 --> 02:28:20.891
THE BILL -- ONE I I HOPE -- THAT

02:28:20.958 --> 02:28:22.093
EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THAT

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:23.928
EMPLOYERS COMPLETELY AGREE THAT

02:28:23.995 --> 02:28:25.630
A PSYCHIATRIC INJURY AS A REAL

02:28:25.696 --> 02:28:28.099
INJURY -- ANY ANY IDEA TO THE

02:28:28.165 --> 02:28:30.167
CONTRARY IS JUST PLAIN WRONG --

02:28:30.234 --> 02:28:31.235
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE FOLKS

02:28:31.302 --> 02:28:32.103
THAT ARE AS BRAVE AS THE

02:28:32.169 --> 02:28:32.970
GENTLEMAN THAT YOU JUST HEARD

02:28:33.037 --> 02:28:34.572
DOING THE THINGS.

02:28:34.639 --> 02:28:35.940
THAT THEY DO -- UP MY OWN

02:28:36.007 --> 02:28:37.275
BROTHER IS A VOLUNTEER

02:28:37.341 --> 02:28:39.210
FIREFIGHTER UP IN LASSEN COUNTY --

02:28:39.277 --> 02:28:40.645
WE ALL I THINK WE ALL KNOW THESE

02:28:40.711 --> 02:28:41.646
FOLKS AND SEE FIRSTHAND OF THESE

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:42.913
ARE REAL INJURIES THAT SHOULD BE

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:44.181
DEALT WITH BY THE WORKERS

02:28:44.248 --> 02:28:46.250
COMPENSATION SYSTEM -- I ALSO

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:46.884
WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE JUST TO

02:28:46.951 --> 02:28:49.453
THANK THE COMMITTEE THE STAFF --

STAFF -- THERE'RE ON REAL AMOUNT

02:28:54.225 --> 02:28:56.594
OF TIME THAT WORKING THAT WERE --

02:28:56.661 --> 02:28:58.996
SPENT TALKING TO US IN REAL

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:01.365
DETAIL ABOUT THE POLICY ISSUES

02:29:01.432 --> 02:29:03.000
RELATED TO THIS BILL THAT

02:29:03.067 --> 02:29:04.402
SENATOR STERN SELF SPENT ABOUT

02:29:04.468 --> 02:29:06.070
AN HOUR AND A HALF WITH US --

02:29:06.137 --> 02:29:07.438
GOING THROUGH THE STUFF HIS TO

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:09.173
HIS STAFF IN TOTAL PROBABLY FOUR

02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:10.708
PLUS HOURS IN YOUR COMMITTEE

02:29:10.775 --> 02:29:11.809
SIMILAR AMOUNTS OF TIME.

02:29:11.876 --> 02:29:13.244
WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DEPTH

02:29:13.311 --> 02:29:20.584
OF THE POLICY DISCUSSION OTHER

02:29:20.651 --> 02:29:21.218
WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE SO THANK YOU

02:29:21.285 --> 02:29:22.286
CENTER -- THE COMMITTEE

02:29:22.353 --> 02:29:23.321
AMENDMENTS DO SUBSTANTIALLY

02:29:23.387 --> 02:29:24.488
ALTER THE BILL I DON'T PRETEND

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:25.523
LIKE THEY DOUBT -- WE ARE STILL

02:29:25.589 --> 02:29:26.290
OPPOSED TO THE BILL I AND AND

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:26.957
IT'S FOR ONE MAJOR REASON -- AND

02:29:27.024 --> 02:29:28.859
THAT IS THAT WE JUST DON'T SEE

02:29:28.926 --> 02:29:30.227
HOW THE BILL.

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:31.395
ADDRESSES THE ISSUES THAT HAVE

02:29:31.462 --> 02:29:32.897
BEEN RAISED THERE'S A LOT OF

02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:35.666
TALK ABOUT THE STIGMA OF FILING

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:36.934
THESE TYPES OF CLAIMS ARE

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:38.369
SEEKING THIS TYPE OF OF INJURY

02:29:38.436 --> 02:29:40.137
AND CENTER I'VE HAVE HAVE SPOKEN

02:29:40.204 --> 02:29:41.105
ABOUT THIS.

02:29:41.172 --> 02:29:42.373
IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT

02:29:42.440 --> 02:29:44.575
THERE'S A 26% RATE THE DATA THAT

02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:45.509
THE SPONSORS POINT TO THAT

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:47.278
THERE'S A 26% RATE OF CLINICAL

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:48.512
DEPRESSION.

02:29:48.579 --> 02:29:50.715
BUT WE ONLY SEE ABOUT ONE POINT

02:29:50.781 --> 02:29:51.782
THREE ONE POINT 4% OF

02:29:51.849 --> 02:29:54.185
FIREFIGHTERS FILING CLAIMS.

02:29:54.251 --> 02:29:56.320
SO IF YOU CHANGE THE PRESUMPTION

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:57.488
WHICH IS BASICALLY HOW THE

02:29:57.555 --> 02:29:59.256
OPERATION OF OF THE WORKERS

02:29:59.323 --> 02:30:01.459
COMPENSATION SYSTEM EXISTS WHAT

02:30:01.525 --> 02:30:02.993
THE STANDARD IS FOR ACCEPTING A

02:30:03.060 --> 02:30:03.661
CLAIM.

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:05.830
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THOSE

02:30:05.896 --> 02:30:07.365
25% OF FIREFIGHTERS WHO AND

02:30:07.431 --> 02:30:10.034
POLICE OFFICERS WHO SIMPLY ARE

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:11.369
NOT FILING THE CLAIMS.

02:30:11.435 --> 02:30:12.903
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A

02:30:12.970 --> 02:30:15.072
DISCONNECT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

02:30:15.139 --> 02:30:16.140
BETWEEN THE PROBLEM THAT'S BEING

02:30:16.207 --> 02:30:18.042
DESCRIBED AND ULTIMATELY THE

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:19.410
SOLUTION THAT'S CONTAINED WITHIN

02:30:19.477 --> 02:30:20.144
THE BILL.

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:22.313
AND THAT'S A MAJOR REASON FOR

02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:23.614
OPPOSITION HERE I'M GONNA DO AND

02:30:23.681 --> 02:30:24.281
MAKE A COUPLE MORE OBSERVATIONS

02:30:24.348 --> 02:30:27.852
ABOUT WHAT IS IN THE ACTUAL

02:30:27.918 --> 02:30:29.253
ANALYSIS.

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.121
AND THE REASONS FOR OPPOSITION

02:30:30.187 --> 02:30:31.655
THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBES

02:30:31.722 --> 02:30:32.757
PRESUMPTIONS IS A KIND OF A

02:30:32.823 --> 02:30:34.658
FUNDAMENTAL DEVIATION FROM THE

02:30:34.725 --> 02:30:36.127
THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EMPLOYEES

02:30:36.193 --> 02:30:37.528
AND EMPLOYERS IT REALLY IS THE

02:30:37.595 --> 02:30:38.596
LEGISLATURE.

02:30:38.662 --> 02:30:39.964
PUTTING ALL OF THEIR WEIGHT ON

02:30:40.030 --> 02:30:42.066
THE SCALE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:43.167
AN INJURY IS ACCEPTED IN IT IT

02:30:43.234 --> 02:30:45.970
IS VERY HARD -- FOR EMPLOYERS TO

02:30:46.036 --> 02:30:47.004
OVERCOME THAT PRESUMPTION

02:30:47.071 --> 02:30:49.173
SECONDARILY THE ANALYSIS POINTS

02:30:49.240 --> 02:30:50.241
OUT THAT WERE ONLY SUPPOSED TO

02:30:50.307 --> 02:30:51.142
REALLY DO THIS IN UNIQUE

02:30:51.208 --> 02:30:52.510
CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT'S THE

02:30:52.576 --> 02:30:53.778
OPERATION OF THE WORKERS

02:30:53.844 --> 02:30:55.980
COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

02:30:56.046 --> 02:30:57.415
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.849
AND THEN THE ANALYSIS GOES ON TO

02:30:58.916 --> 02:31:00.151
POINT OUT THAT THERE IS NO DATA

02:31:00.217 --> 02:31:01.719
THERE IS NO DATA THAT SUGGESTS

02:31:01.786 --> 02:31:03.053
THAT THE WORKERS COMPENSATION

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:04.321
SYSTEM IS DYSFUNCTIONAL IN

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.090
DEALING WITH THESE PARTICULAR

02:31:06.157 --> 02:31:08.426
CLAIMS -- AND THAT JUST LEAVES

02:31:08.492 --> 02:31:10.060
US BECAUSE OF THAT WEIGHT PUT ON

02:31:10.127 --> 02:31:11.862
THE SCALE IF THERE'S NO DATA AND

02:31:11.929 --> 02:31:13.564
WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE BILL'S

02:31:13.631 --> 02:31:14.932
ACTUALLY RESOLVING THE PROBLEM

02:31:14.999 --> 02:31:16.467
IS EXTRAORDINARILY PROBLEMATIC

02:31:16.534 --> 02:31:18.769
FOR US ON A ON A POLICY LEVEL TO

02:31:18.836 --> 02:31:19.336
MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF A

02:31:19.403 --> 02:31:20.070
PRESUMPTION.

02:31:20.137 --> 02:31:21.772
I WITH THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY

02:31:21.839 --> 02:31:22.973
UNDERSTAND THAT AMENDMENTS HAVE

02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:24.041
BEEN TAKEN THERE'S AN AGREEMENT

02:31:24.108 --> 02:31:24.742
BETWEEN.

02:31:24.809 --> 02:31:26.811
THE SENATOR -- AND THE COMMITTEE --

02:31:26.877 --> 02:31:28.512

02:31:28.579 --> 02:31:29.980
BUT AGAIN WE TALKED BEFORE THE

02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:31.916
HEARING -- AND EVEN THOUGH THE

02:31:31.982 --> 02:31:32.817
BILL'S MOVING OUT OF COMMITTEE

02:31:32.883 --> 02:31:33.717
WE'RE GONNA KEEP THE

02:31:33.784 --> 02:31:34.852
CONVERSATION ALIVE AND KEEP THE

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:35.820
DISCUSSION ALIVE AND I REALLY

02:59:39.768 --> 02:59:41.170
BY SAYING WE HAVE GREAT RESPECT

02:59:41.237 --> 02:59:42.071
FOR THE PEACE OFFICERS COVERED

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:44.039

02:59:45.241 --> 02:59:46.976
AS EMPLOYERS AS WAS PREVIOUSLY

02:59:47.042 --> 02:59:48.577
MENTIONED -- IN A PRIOR

02:59:48.644 --> 02:59:50.179
DISCUSSION OUR GOALS HELP

MEDICAL TREATMENT AND RETURNED

02:59:52.948 --> 02:59:53.749
TO WORK.

02:59:53.816 --> 02:59:55.451
OUR OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL IS

02:59:55.518 --> 02:59:56.986
REALLY CENTERED UPON THE SIMPLE

02:59:57.052 --> 02:59:58.354
FACT THAT A PRESUMPTION IS NOT

02:59:58.420 --> 03:00:00.356
REQUIRED OR NECESSARY FOR

03:00:00.422 --> 03:00:02.324
INJURED WORKERS TO HAVE A

03:00:02.391 --> 03:00:03.859
SUCCESSFUL WORKERS COMP CLAIM.

03:00:03.926 --> 03:00:05.127
CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT WORKERS

03:00:05.194 --> 03:00:07.596
COMP SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO FAVOR

03:00:07.663 --> 03:00:09.532
INJURED WORKERS IF THERE'S A

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:11.433
DISPUTE REGARDING A CLAIM AND

03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:12.935
CONNECTION OF THE INJURY TO WORK.

03:00:13.002 --> 03:00:14.470
AND ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE

03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:16.839
FOLLOWS LABOR CODE THIRTY TWO OH

03:00:16.906 --> 03:00:18.007
TWO WHICH STATE STATUTE SHALL BE

03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:19.742
LIBERALLY CONSTRUED WITH THE

03:00:19.808 --> 03:00:22.678
PURPOSE OF EXTENDING BENEFITS TO

03:00:22.745 --> 03:00:24.313
THE INDIVIDUAL.

03:00:24.380 --> 03:00:25.548
WE ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:27.449
THIS IS NOT JUST TECHNICAL CLEAN

03:00:27.516 --> 03:00:29.084
UP OF INADVERTENTLY OMITTED

03:00:29.151 --> 03:00:30.519
PEACE OFFICERS.

03:00:30.586 --> 03:00:32.621
CURRENT LAW INCLUDES AND EXCLUDE

03:00:32.688 --> 03:00:33.756
CERTAIN PEACE OFFICERS FROM

03:00:33.822 --> 03:00:35.524
PRESUMPTIONS BASED ON PRIOR

03:00:35.591 --> 03:00:37.493
LEGISLATION AND AS THE COMMITTEE

03:00:37.560 --> 03:00:39.228
ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THIS BILL

03:00:39.295 --> 03:00:41.730
ALSO CHOOSES TO CONTINUE TO

03:00:41.797 --> 03:00:43.365
EXCLUDE CERTAIN PEACE OFFICERS.

03:00:43.432 --> 03:00:44.533
SO THIS IS NOT TECHNICAL CLEAN

03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:46.468
UP IT'S A COSTLY EXPANSION OF

03:00:46.535 --> 03:00:48.037
PRESUMPTIONS TO ADDITIONAL

03:00:48.103 --> 03:00:49.605
CLASSIFICATIONS OF OFFICERS

03:00:49.672 --> 03:00:51.807
WITHOUT AN OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF

03:00:51.874 --> 03:00:53.409
THE SIMILARITIES OR DIFFERENCES

03:00:53.475 --> 03:00:55.311
OF THE JOB DUTIES OR RATES OF

03:00:55.377 --> 03:00:58.113
THE ILES UNDER THE EXISTING

03:00:58.180 --> 03:01:00.182
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM.

03:01:00.249 --> 03:01:01.684
WHEN IT COMES TO PRESUMPTIONS WE

03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:03.052
THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO STUDY

03:01:03.118 --> 03:01:05.187
THE DATA INJURY RATES OF DENIAL

03:01:05.254 --> 03:01:06.322
HOW ARE THINGS OCCURRING WITHIN

03:01:06.388 --> 03:01:08.123
THE EXISTING SYSTEM BEFORE

03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:09.658
CHANGING A SYSTEM?

03:01:09.725 --> 03:01:10.859
SO WE WOULD WELCOME THAT KIND OF

03:01:10.926 --> 03:01:13.362
STUDY OR REVIEW BUT UNTIL THAT.

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:15.297
TIME WE WOULD REMAIN OPPOSED TO

03:01:15.364 --> 03:01:18.133
THE COST AN INVESTIGATIVE DUTIES

03:01:18.200 --> 03:01:20.636
THIS WOULD CAUSE FOR EMPLOYERS.

03:01:20.703 --> 03:01:22.004
THANK YOU GO HEAD MISTER

03:01:22.071 --> 03:01:23.005

CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS

COMPENSATION ADDS ONE ADDRESS

03:01:28.577 --> 03:01:30.980
ONE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE -- THE

03:01:31.046 --> 03:01:32.481
GENTLEMAN ASSERTED THAT FOLKS

03:01:32.548 --> 03:01:33.816
ARE COVERED BY THE WORKERS

03:01:33.882 --> 03:01:35.150
COMPENSATION SYSTEM I I JUST

03:01:35.217 --> 03:01:36.418
WANT TO CLARIFY THAT ALL

03:01:36.485 --> 03:01:37.453
EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY THE

03:01:37.519 --> 03:01:38.954
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHAT

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:40.589
THIS BILL DOES AND WHAT IT WOULD

03:01:40.656 --> 03:01:42.825
CORRECT IN A SENSE -- IS IT PUTS

03:01:42.891 --> 03:01:45.094
THE WEIGHT ON THE SCALE AGAIN IT

03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:47.496
CHANGES THE BURDEN OF PROOF --

03:01:47.563 --> 03:01:49.098
FROM AN EMPLOYEE HAVING TO

03:01:49.164 --> 03:01:50.532
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WERE HEARD

03:01:50.599 --> 03:01:51.200

03:01:51.267 --> 03:01:51.934
JOB.

03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:53.936
A TO ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING THE

EMPLOYER TO PROVE THAT THEY

03:01:54.737 --> 03:01:56.171
WORKED AT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

03:01:56.238 --> 03:01:58.073
HERE -- BUT AS FAR AS COVERAGE

03:01:58.140 --> 03:01:59.875
GOES -- ALL EMPLOYEES ARE

COVERED -- I'LL BE VERY BRIEF

03:02:01.710 --> 03:02:03.779
AFTER THAT I DON'T REPEAT MYSELF

TOO MUCH AND IN ONE DAY.

03:02:05.180 --> 03:02:05.948
AT THE END OF THE POLICY

03:02:06.015 --> 03:02:08.684
COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT I GO BACK

03:02:08.751 --> 03:02:10.352
TO THE ANALYSIS AGAIN -- YOU

03:02:11.654 --> 03:02:13.689
PRESUMPTIONS -- ARE A DEVIATION

03:02:13.756 --> 03:02:15.124
FROM KIND OF THIS GRAND BARGAIN

03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:16.525
THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES

03:02:16.592 --> 03:02:18.360
HAVE -- BECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT

03:02:18.427 --> 03:02:19.828
THAT IT'S PUTTING ON THE SCALE

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:21.897
THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE ONLY

03:02:21.964 --> 03:02:22.531
UNDER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

03:02:22.598 --> 03:02:23.365
IT'S DEMONSTRATED THAT THE

03:02:23.432 --> 03:02:24.667
WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM

03:02:24.733 --> 03:02:25.634
ISN'T WORKING.

03:02:25.701 --> 03:02:27.102
AND IT SHOULD BE BASED ON DATA

03:02:27.169 --> 03:02:28.237
AND THEN AGAIN THE ANALYSIS

03:02:28.304 --> 03:02:29.705
POINTS OUT THAT THERE IS REALLY

03:02:29.772 --> 03:02:32.441
