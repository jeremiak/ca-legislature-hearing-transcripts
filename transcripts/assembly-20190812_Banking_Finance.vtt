MOURN THE DEATHS AND SYMPATHIZE

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.569

TO REDUCE OUR OWN VULNERABILITY.

00:27:20.438 --> 00:27:21.539
TO TRY AND PREVENT MASS

00:27:21.606 --> 00:27:23.808

GUN ACCIDENTS. I BELIEVE WE

00:27:31.983 --> 00:27:33.752
MUST ACT ON ALL FRONTS TO

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:36.921
ADDRESS GUN CONTROL. THIS

00:27:36.988 --> 00:27:38.890
INCLUDES INVESTIGATING THE

GROUND FOR ANTI GUN VIOLENCE

00:27:49.934 --> 00:27:53.405
ACTIVISM. AND YET SIX OF THE

WITH HAVE PRIORITIZE PROFIT

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:59.778
OVER CALIFORNIAN VALUES. WHY DO

00:27:59.844 --> 00:28:01.513
BANKS REMAIN RELATIVELY QUIET

00:28:01.579 --> 00:28:03.448
WHILE CALIFORNIANS HAVE BEEN SO

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:05.483
VOCAL ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AND

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:08.019
GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. THE

TWENTY FIFTEEN SIX IN TEN

00:28:13.458 --> 00:28:13.992
CALIFORNIANS WANT STRICTER GUN

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:17.796

00:28:23.601 --> 00:28:25.136
CREDIT TO GUN MANUFACTURERS

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.237
WHICH A MAJORITY OF

00:28:26.304 --> 00:28:26.771
CALIFORNIANS HAVE DEEMED A

00:28:26.838 --> 00:28:30.542
SOCIAL HAZARD. CITY BANK IS A

00:28:30.608 --> 00:28:31.976
POSITIVE EXAMPLE OF A

00:28:32.043 --> 00:28:33.178
CALIFORNIA BANKING INSTITUTION

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:34.746
THAT HAS TAKEN THE LEAD AND IS

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:35.680
SLOWLY DIVESTING FROM GUN

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:39.284
MANUFACTURERS. AND YET THERE

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.918
ARE OTHERS WHO SPEAK OF CODE OF

00:28:39.984 --> 00:28:43.455
ETHICS. PROMISING TO SPEAK UP

00:28:43.521 --> 00:28:47.225
WHEN THEY SEE SOMETHING. AND

00:28:47.292 --> 00:28:49.194
TALKING ABOUT THE ABILITY TO DO

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.395
THE RIGHT THING IN MAKING SURE

00:28:50.462 --> 00:28:51.396
THAT THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.631
THING AS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

00:28:53.698 --> 00:28:55.266
WHEN IT IS NOT THE EASY THING

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:57.268
TO DO AND YET THEY MAKE NO

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.470
PUBLIC STANCE ON DOING BUSINESS

00:28:58.536 --> 00:29:00.538

CONTINUED TO FINANCE MILLIONS.

00:29:02.006 --> 00:29:05.110
WITH THE GUN INDUSTRY. NOW

00:29:05.176 --> 00:29:07.145
THESE BANKS ARE NOT BREAKING

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:08.847
ANY LAWS AND THIS IS A

00:29:08.913 --> 00:29:10.548
RESOLUTION IT IS NOT A

00:29:10.615 --> 00:29:13.084
RESOLUTION ABOUT BREAKING LAWS

00:29:13.151 --> 00:29:13.618

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:18.857
ABOUT. CHANGING BEHAVIOR. IT'S

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:22.327
A RESOLUTION ABOUT VALUES. WHY

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:24.395
IS IT OKAY THAT WE ASK OUR

00:29:24.462 --> 00:29:24.963
PARENTS TO BUY BULLET PROOF

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:28.099
BACKPACKS. BUT WE'RE NOT

CALIFORNIA HAS A STRONG THIS

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:30.929
GUN LAWS IN THE NATION. AND

00:30:30.995 --> 00:30:32.931
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WE

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:33.765
HAVE DROPPED HER GUN DEATH RATE

00:30:33.831 --> 00:30:37.035
BY 55% ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:38.336
DECREASE IN THE REST OF THE

00:30:38.403 --> 00:30:39.537
NATION. OUR GUN LAWS ARE MAKING

00:30:39.604 --> 00:30:43.174
A DIFFERENCE. BUT NONE THE LESS

00:30:43.241 --> 00:30:44.776
WITH OVER THREE THOUSAND

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:47.345
FIREARM DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:47.912
TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT'S THE

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:48.947
LAST YEAR FOR WHICH WE HAVE

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:53.551
DATA. CLEARLY MORE MUST BE DONE.

00:30:53.618 --> 00:30:55.253
NOT AND ONE OF THE PROTESTERS

00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:56.955
TO ADDRESS THE PROLIFERATION OF

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:59.257
GUNS. THE RESEARCH IS VERY

00:30:59.324 --> 00:31:01.059
CLEAR THAT WHERE THERE ARE MORE

00:31:01.125 --> 00:31:02.794
GUNS THERE ARE MORE FIREARM

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.129
DEATH WE HAVE THE INDUSTRY AND

00:31:05.196 --> 00:31:08.032
OUR NATION WHOSE PURPOSE IS TO

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:10.735
SELL MORE GUNS AND MAKE MONEY.

00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:12.737
ARE THE NRA I THINK IT'S FAIR

00:31:12.804 --> 00:31:14.439
TO SAY REPRESENTS THE GUN

00:31:14.505 --> 00:31:17.709
INDUSTRY GUN MANUFACTURERS NOT

00:31:17.775 --> 00:31:20.645
THE PUBLIC AS THE PUBLIC ARE.

00:31:20.712 --> 00:31:21.713
THE LARGE MAJORITY OF THE

00:31:21.779 --> 00:31:23.915
PUBLIC OVER 90% SUPPORT

00:31:23.982 --> 00:31:25.383
BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR ALL GUN

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.087
SALES. 87% ARE SUPPORT RED FLAG

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.755
WORD COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDER

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.290
TYPE LAWS I THINK IT'S IN THE

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:34.292
LATE HI SIXTIES PERCENT SUPPORT

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:37.262
ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN. THE

00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:37.729
MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT

00:31:37.795 --> 00:31:42.000
WASHINGTON. DOES NOT TO IN

00:31:42.066 --> 00:31:42.467
TERMS OF GUN VIOLENCE

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:43.001
PREVENTION. AND WHERE THE

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.769
PUBLIC OPINION IS ON THIS ISSUE

00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:46.137
IS BECAUSE OF THE POWER

00:31:46.204 --> 00:31:48.139
INFLUENCE OF THE GUN INDUSTRY

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:50.241
WE NEED TO PUSH BACK AGAINST

00:31:50.308 --> 00:31:51.876
GUN INDUSTRY AND ONE WAY TO DO

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:54.145
THAT. AS I SUGGESTED BY THIS

00:31:54.212 --> 00:31:57.282
RESOLUTION IS TO STOP THE

00:31:57.348 --> 00:32:00.918
LENDING TO GUN MANUFACTURERS

00:32:00.985 --> 00:32:04.188
WORE OUT SO THAT THEY CAN'T BE

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.958
IN A BAY HAVE TO GO ELSEWHERE

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:08.259
AND MAY BE PAUSE IF THEY'RE

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:09.961
LOSING THAT KIND OF THING

00:32:10.028 --> 00:32:11.562
FINANCING FROM THE STATE OF

00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:13.564
CALIFORNIA BANKS THAT WORK WITH

00:32:13.631 --> 00:32:14.299
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:32:14.365 --> 00:32:16.267
THERE'S BEEN OTHER EFFORTS

00:32:16.334 --> 00:32:17.735
SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS TO GET THE

00:32:17.802 --> 00:32:20.004
GUN INDUSTRY TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR

00:32:20.071 --> 00:32:22.140
BOB FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

00:32:22.206 --> 00:32:24.976
PUTTING PRESSURE ON. FOR

00:32:25.043 --> 00:32:26.411
EXAMPLE NOT SELLING GUNS TO

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:28.646
UNDER TWO PEOPLE AGE TWENTY ONE

00:32:28.713 --> 00:32:30.515
OR NOT TELLING ASSAULT WEAPONS

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:32.050
THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS TO

00:32:32.116 --> 00:32:35.186
CHANGE BEHAVIOR SO THAT FEWER

00:32:35.253 --> 00:32:36.587
INAPPROPRIATE PEOPLE ARE

00:32:36.654 --> 00:32:37.789
POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS PEOPLE

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:41.159
HAVE ACCESS TO FIREARMS. AND I

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:44.028
THINK THIS EFFORT TO. A

00:32:44.095 --> 00:32:45.296
RESOLUTION AND THE LANDING TO

00:32:45.363 --> 00:32:46.798
GUN MANUFACTURERS AND THAT'S

00:32:46.864 --> 00:32:48.566
THAT SOME REMEMBER SAID THIS IS

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:51.002
A NEW LAW IT'S A RESOLUTION.

00:32:51.069 --> 00:32:53.504
BUT I THINK IT'S A STATEMENT OF

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:55.773
NOT ONLY WERE CALIFORNIA IS BUT

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.609
WORK WHERE OUR NATION IS. ON

00:32:58.676 --> 00:33:02.013
THIS MATTER THAT WE ARE IN A

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.348
CRISIS IN OUR COUNTRY RIGHT NOW

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.582
WITH GUN VIOLENCE WE NEED ALL

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:09.487
APPROACHES. TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:12.090
CRISIS AND THIS IS ONE WAY IS

00:33:12.156 --> 00:33:15.126
SIGNIFICANT WAY I THINK THAT WE

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:17.395
CAN PUSH BACK ON GUN

00:33:17.462 --> 00:33:20.264

00:34:15.019 --> 00:34:17.121
CHAIN QUESTION AND THE UPSTREAM

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:19.791
PART OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE

00:34:19.857 --> 00:34:21.659
SEE AND FEEL AND EXPERIENCE IN

00:34:21.726 --> 00:34:22.493
OUR COMMUNITIES WHICH WE'VE

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.395

COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AS

INCLUDING OUR BANKS SO I THINK

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:44.115
IT'S A CRITICAL RESOLUTION AND

00:34:44.182 --> 00:34:46.017
I THINK WE ALL HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:34:46.083 --> 00:34:47.084
WHEN WE HAVE THIRTY THREE

00:34:47.151 --> 00:34:48.653

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:51.289
HOW WE'RE ALL TAKING PERSONAL

00:34:51.355 --> 00:34:53.324
RESPONSIBILITY FOR SOLVING THIS

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:54.125
PROBLEM SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:35:08.639 --> 00:35:10.975
THE GOAL. BEHIND THIS

00:35:11.042 --> 00:35:15.613
RESOLUTION YOU WANT. GUN

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.348
MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS TO

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:20.852
NOT HAVE A FINANCIAL

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.153
INSTITUTION WITH WHICH TO BANK

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.390
IS THAT THE GOAL THE GOAL IS TO

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.893
EXPAND THE CONVERSATION THAT

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.528
WE'VE BEEN HAVING AROUND GUN

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.029
VIOLENCE AND GUN VIOLENCE

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:33.397
PREVENTION OKAY BUT YOUR

00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:34.832
ISOLATION DOESN'T ASK FOR

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:36.734
CONVERSATION IT ENCOURAGES

00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:38.736
BANKS TO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH

00:35:38.803 --> 00:35:40.338
GUN MANUFACTURERS AND GUN

00:35:40.404 --> 00:35:41.973
RETAILERS SO THAT'S WHY I'M

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:43.975
SAYING IT'S LEADING ME TO

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.410
BELIEVE THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO BE

00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:48.646
IS TO PUT GUN MANUFACTURERS AND

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:49.547
RETAILERS IN A POSITION WHERE

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:50.882
THEY DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL

00:35:50.948 --> 00:35:52.884
INSTITUTION. WITH WHICH TO DO

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:55.286
BUSINESS IS THAT YOUR GOAL THAT

00:35:55.353 --> 00:35:57.221
IS ONE OF THE GOALS BUT THIS

00:35:57.288 --> 00:35:59.156
RIGHT HERE IS THE CONVERSATION

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.158
THAT WE'RE HAVING JUST BECAUSE

00:36:01.225 --> 00:36:02.560
WE BROUGHT THE RESOLUTION

00:36:02.627 --> 00:36:05.129
FORWARD WE TEND TO HAVE A

00:36:05.196 --> 00:36:06.864
NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AS IT

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.432
RELATES TO GUN VIOLENCE

00:36:08.499 --> 00:36:10.701
SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY ON THE

00:36:10.768 --> 00:36:13.538
DEMAND SIDE THE FOLKS WHO WANT

00:36:13.604 --> 00:36:14.906
TO PURCHASE A GUN THE FOLKS WHO

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:17.174
HAVE A GUN IF THEY HAVE A GUN

00:36:17.241 --> 00:36:18.943
THAT'S- BEEN LEGALLY PURCHASED

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:20.745
OR NOT. WHERE THEY'RE BUYING

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:23.047
THE GUN FROM WHO THE DEALER IS

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:24.248
HOW MUCH AMMUNITION THEY'RE

00:36:24.315 --> 00:36:25.082
ALLOWED TO PER WHAT'S BILLION A

00:36:25.149 --> 00:36:26.851
DAY IS THAT OF ANY FINANCIAL

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:29.520
INSTITUTIONS SO THAT HAS BEEN

00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:31.389
THE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.990
WE'VE BEEN HAVING THIS IS

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.959
SAYING LET'S HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.328
CONVERSATION ALSO AS IT RELATES

00:36:37.395 --> 00:36:38.596
TO GUN VIOLENCE AND GUN

00:36:38.663 --> 00:36:40.398
VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND TALK

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:41.599
ABOUT THE SUPPLY SIDE YOU

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:44.468
CANNOT HAVE A GUN IF THE GUN IS

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:47.305
NOT BEEN MADE. YOU CANNOT SELL

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:49.740
A GUN THAT HAS NOT BEEN MADE

00:36:49.807 --> 00:36:51.576
THE REALITY IS THERE FOUR

00:36:51.642 --> 00:36:53.177
HUNDRED MILLION GUNS IN THIS

00:36:53.244 --> 00:36:57.715
COUNTRY SO EVERYONE STILL HAS

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:58.649
AN OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST HAVE

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:02.853
ONE. BUT I AM CERTAINLY NOT

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.421
INTERESTED IN JUST TALKING

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:04.055
ABOUT THE DEMAND SIDE THE OTHER

00:37:04.121 --> 00:37:06.324
REALITY IS WE LIVE. IN A FREE

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:09.727
MARKET SOCIETY SO I THINK IT'S

00:37:09.794 --> 00:37:11.495
PRESUMPTUOUS TO SAY IF YOU

00:37:11.562 --> 00:37:13.230
CANNOT GO TO ONE LENDING

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:14.632
INSTITUTION THEN YOUR

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.701
OPPORTUNITY TO MANUFACTURE A

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:20.838
GUN IS SHOT. THAT'S KIND OF THE

00:37:20.905 --> 00:37:22.773
INCENTIVE TO LIVING IN A FREE

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.276
MARKET CAPITALISTIC SOCIETY

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:25.843
IT'S ALSO I THINK UNFAIR TO

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.480
SUGGEST. THAT THIS IS THE YOU

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.748
KNOW THE ONLY PRODUCT THAT'S

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:32.116
AVAILABLE FOR LENDING

00:37:32.183 --> 00:37:34.285
INSTITUTIONS TO INVESTING IN

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:36.153
ORDER TO MAKE MONEY WE HAVE

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.955
SEEN THAT PROVE ITSELF NOT TO

00:37:38.022 --> 00:37:40.591
BE TRUE IN HISTORY AS IT

00:37:40.658 --> 00:37:44.128
RELATES TO YOU KNOW. INSTANCES

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:46.597
LIKE DIVESTING IN SOUTH AFRICA.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:48.766
COMPANIES STILL FOUND WAYS TO

00:37:48.833 --> 00:37:49.367
EARN MONEY AND TO BE SOCIALLY

00:37:49.433 --> 00:37:53.938
RESPONSIBLE. OKAY I AM EVEN

00:37:54.005 --> 00:37:57.642
MORE CONFUSING I'M YOU. YOU

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:59.410
STATED THAT YOUR GOAL IS TO GET

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:00.945
TO THE POINT WHERE THESE

00:38:01.012 --> 00:38:02.480
MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.949
HAVE NO FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:06.250
TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU ALSO

00:38:06.317 --> 00:38:10.721
MADE A COMMENT ABOUT. IF THE

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:11.822
GUN DOESN'T EXIST THING YOU

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:13.758
CAN'T BUY IT SO I GUESS THE

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:16.527
OTHER PART OF THE GOAL IS TO.

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:19.563
JUST GET TO A POINT WHERE.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.998
THESE WEAPONS AREN'T BEING

00:38:21.065 --> 00:38:23.034
MANUFACTURED IS THAT PART OF

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.769
THE GOAL THAT LESS GUNS OUR

00:38:24.835 --> 00:38:26.270
MAIN GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:27.738

HAS BEEN FOLLOW THROUGH IN

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:51.762
THINKING ABOUT THE

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.264
RAMIFICATIONS OF SOMETHING LIKE

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:54.632

CALIFORNIANS CHIANG MAI

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:28.165

SUPPOSED TO BE A SHORT HEARING

00:41:12.636 --> 00:41:14.905
I WILL JUST SAY THAT I THINK

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:17.174
THE THIRD OFF A LOT OF THINGS

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:18.642
WRONG WITH THIS RESOLUTION EVEN

00:41:18.709 --> 00:41:20.611
THIS IS THIS ISN'T LEGALLY

00:41:20.678 --> 00:41:21.779
BINDING IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE

00:41:21.846 --> 00:41:24.548
LAW. BUT IT CERTAINLY IF I WERE

00:41:24.615 --> 00:41:25.182
A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I WOULD

00:41:25.249 --> 00:41:27.184
TAKE IT AS A THREAT. I WOULD

00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:28.485
TAKE IT AS A THREAT COMING

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:30.421
FROM. THE LEGISLATURE SAYING IF

00:41:30.487 --> 00:41:32.790
YOU DON'T IMPOSE OUR WILL ON

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.458
YOUR CLIENTS. THERE WILL BE

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:36.227
CONSEQUENCES AND I DON'T THINK

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:38.629
THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE.

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:40.664
PART PARTICIPATING IN THAT SORT

00:41:40.731 --> 00:41:41.932

VIEW POINT THAT YOU WANT TO

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.404

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION I

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:51.976

00:41:52.042 --> 00:41:54.011
PRECEDENT TO SET. AND I THINK

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:57.147

00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:58.582
TABLES MIGHT BE TURNED IN YOU

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.018
MIGHT NOT LIKE THE WAY SOMEONE

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:04.221
ELSE IMPOSES THIS THIS TYPE OF

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:05.923
LEGISLATION ON OTHER INDUSTRY

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.358

ONE OH NINE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:32.222
APPEARANCE THAT THE TRYING TO

PEORIA AT THE BY CERTAIN THEN I

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.384

THE WHEN YOU TRY TO. INTRODUCED

00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:06.089
AS SUCH RESOLUTION EVEN THOUGHT

THAT IS ON NOT ENFORCEABLE IT'S

00:47:08.859 --> 00:47:11.695
A SORT ABA ENCOURAGEMENT. BUT

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:13.463
THE NOW YOU MENTIONED ON

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.132
SEVERAL TIME COUPLE TIMES THAT

00:47:15.199 --> 00:47:15.632
THAT THE FREE MARKET THE

00:47:15.699 --> 00:47:19.570
CONCEPT. WHEN IF YOU TO

00:47:21.939 --> 00:47:24.841
RESOLUTION. AND THEN A HOLLOW

00:47:24.908 --> 00:47:28.278
WITH THIS WOULD BE PERCEIVED.

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:31.315
BY THOSE INDUSTRY AND THE BANKS.

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:33.383

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.920
ALMOST A LACK OF WRITING ON THE

00:47:36.987 --> 00:47:39.289
WALL WHAT IS COMING. THAT THE

00:47:39.356 --> 00:47:43.393
ORDER VIA TOTALLY IF STEP AND

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:46.296
COREY RESOLUTION DOESN'T WORK.

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:48.332

AT THIS RESOLUTION THEN WE CAN

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:59.176
I INTRODUCED A BILL. NOW THAT

00:47:59.243 --> 00:47:59.810
THAT THAT IS ALL OR MOST ALL IN

00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:04.982
ALL. T. MOBILE NEXT STEP. AND A

00:48:05.048 --> 00:48:05.949
WHAT WOULD BE THE NEXT TO KIND

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:10.520
OF INDUSTRY THAT WE LEGISLATORS

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:15.025
SO WE TRY TO A BAND BANGSA NOT

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:17.828
TO DO ANY BUSINESS ANY ANY

00:48:17.894 --> 00:48:20.497
INDUSTRY ABOUT BUSINESS SO ODD

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:22.432
THAT THAT WE DON'T NOT LACK

00:48:22.499 --> 00:48:26.436
HILL SO THIS IS OUR QUARTERLY.

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:29.306
THE ARE INCOMPATIBLE WERE

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:32.009
CONCEPT OF AMERICAN CAPITALISM

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:34.711
AND FREE MARKET GAME AND THAT'S

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:37.347
A SHOULD BE A NOT BANKS WON'T

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:41.785
PRINCIPLE. WHOM YOU WILL NOT DO

00:48:41.852 --> 00:48:46.023
BUSINESS WITH. OKAY THE OTHER

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:48.558
QUESTION IS THAT IF YOU DO BàN

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.093
OR PROHIBIT TO ENCOURAGE THE

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:53.764
RULE OF OUR SOLUTION ON ALL OF.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.099
AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER LISA

00:48:56.166 --> 00:49:00.370
MELENDEZ INDICATED THAT THERE

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.805
ARE TWO SIDES OF MONEY IS A

00:49:01.872 --> 00:49:03.473
CONSUMER USE AT THE OTHER ONE

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.043
IS OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT MILITARY

00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:09.413
AWHILE PLEASE AWARE NEVER. SO

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:10.047
WHAT WOULD BE THE CONSEQUENCES

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:12.582
OF THE WARSAW SO I YOU WANNA.

00:49:12.649 --> 00:49:16.053
AMERICAN EXCEPTION IF YOU NEED

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:17.754
THE MILLION DOLLAR LOAN TO A

00:49:17.821 --> 00:49:20.324
MANUFACTURER ARE ASSAULT

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.693
WEAPONS SO THAT WILL BE SOLD

00:49:22.759 --> 00:49:28.065
THE TO MILITARY ALONE THEN. YOU

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:31.935
CAN DO LOAN BANKING. AND THEY

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:33.937
GIVE THE LOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:35.372
THEY'RE SUCH YOU QUESTIONS NESN

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:36.840
DOT I MEAN RAISING NUMBER OF

00:49:36.907 --> 00:49:38.508
WITH THINGS SUCH AS I SPEAK SO

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:41.978
I AM BASICALLY SAYING THAT THAT

00:49:42.045 --> 00:49:43.714
THIS APPROACH EVEN THOUGHT I

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.049
UNDERSTAND YOU OR WRITTEN

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:47.517
INTENT. BUT THE WHEN WE TALK

00:49:47.584 --> 00:49:48.785
ABOUT THIS KIND OF PRINCE

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:50.954
SPORTS SO AND THEN ALSO NEXT

00:49:51.021 --> 00:49:53.357
THAT IMPLEMENTATION IN ALL OF

00:49:53.423 --> 00:49:55.992
THIS IS SAID TO ME A VIOLATION

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:58.161
OF A FREE KIND OF PRETTY MARKET

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:59.496
CONCEPT THE AND INDIVIDUAL

00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:02.265
RIGHTS. AND THE FREEDOM ARE

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:07.671
FULL. IF THE INDUSTRIAL

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:11.375
INDIVIDUALS OF DOING BUSINESS.

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.042
AND THE IMPLEMENTATION STAGE IS

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:13.377
GOING TO BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:50:13.443 --> 00:50:14.911
HOW WE CANNOT DISTINGUISH A WE

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:16.213
WILL NEED THE PRODUCTION OF

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:17.314
WEAPONS SELF FOR NATIONAL

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:18.248
DEFENSE SO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:50:18.315 --> 00:50:20.817
WHATEVER. MIGHT SOLA CERTAIN

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.619
COMPANIES WILL BE DEDICATED TO
