SENATOR BRADFORD MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION FIFTY EIGHT BY SENATOR BRADFORD RELATIVE TO JUNETEENTH SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AS VICE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS I'M HONORED TO PRESENT AS C. R.. FIFTY EIGHT I SEE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COMMEMORATES JUNE EIGHTEENTH AS A DAY OF HONOR AND REFLECTS ON THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE AND HISTORY OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IT KNOWLEDGE IS THE FAILURE OF JUSTICE FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND REALLY THE LACK OF TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN HISTORY. THIS MEASURE RECOGNIZES JUNE NINETEENTH. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AS JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY. ALSO COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS EMANCIPATION DAY OR FREEDOM DAY WHEN THE LAST SLAVES IN AMERICA. WERE FREE. SPECIALLY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS AND LOUISIANA AND BEING FROM TEXAS THIS HOLIDAY AND MY FAMILY AND MY GRANDPARENTS IN THEIR THEM BEFORE THEM WITH CELEBRATED MORE SO. THAN INDEPENDENCE DAY BECAUSE THIS WAS TRULY THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND MANY ARE FOR AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY. PRESIDENT LINCOLN ISSUED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN. EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO DEMANDING THAT THE CONFEDERATE STATES RETURNED TO THE UNION OR THEIR SLAVES WOULD BE PERMANENTLY FREE. THAT ORDER WAS IGNORED. IT TOOK TWO AND A HALF YEARS FOR THE MESSAGE OF FREEDOM TO REACH TAXES AND GRANITE THERE WAS NO -- CELL PHONES INSTAGRAM AND ON SOCIAL MEDIA. BUT IT SHOULDN'T TAKE IN TWO HUNDRED MI TWO AND A HALF YEARS IT WAS CLEARLY DELIBERATELY DELAYED IN GETTING THAT MESSAGE TO THE SOUTHERN STATES ESPECIALLY AGAIN. LOUISIANA AND TEXAS FREEDOM DELAYED WAS FREEDOM DENIED. GENERAL GORDON GRANGER LET THOUSANDS OF FEDERAL TROOPS TO GALVESTON TEXAS TO ANNOUNCES CIVIL WAR HAD ENDED. AND SLAVES WERE NOW FREE THOUSAND SLAVES IN TEXAS WERE NOT AWARE OF THEIR FREEDOM. HAVE BEEN SECURED BY THE GOVERNMENT. FREEDOM DID NOT ONLY COULD NOT COME EASILY. EVEN AFTER THE NOTICE MANY WERE STILL FORCED TO WORK FAR BEYOND THEIR EMANCIPATION INTO THE HARVEST SEASON. MANY SLAVE OWNERS CONTINUE TO TREAT THE FREEDMAN. AS CHATTEL. THE SLAVE THE GAPS THE NEW THEIR FREEDOM WAS ONLY THE FIRST STEP. NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES BUT FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THE DATE IS NOT JUST ABOUT A CELEBRATION A RECOGNITION IT'S ABOUT REFLECTING ON SOME THE HORRIFIC EVENTS THAT HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY. AND DECADES AFTER THE END OF CIVIL WAR THIS NATION WITNESS SO WAIT A WAVE OF LYNCHING. IMPRISONMENT AND JIM CROW LAWS WERE STILL SUFFERING FROM SOME OF THE FAILURES OF JUSTICE THAT WERE PORTRAYED UPON AFTER AMERICANS EVEN IN THIS DAY OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN ONE PRIME EXAMPLE IS THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. IT'S THE BILL THAT'S BEEN DEBATED HEAVILY IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY AND IF WE LEGISLATE FROM JUST A DAY WE SAY WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT BUT IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND HISTORICAL CONTENT. DO YOU THINK DALY FORCE WAS IMPLEMENTED IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO AND DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE FREE BLACK MAN IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS NATION. WE STILL SEE THE DISPLAY DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT OF INADEQUATE SCHOOL SYSTEMS THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE MASS INCARCERATION DISCRIMINATION HOUSING POLICIES THE LACK OF ECONOMIC INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL THE REMNANTS OF SLAVERY. THE X. LEYVA GALLAS AND HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FREEDOM. BUT THEIR FEARLESS AND RELENTLESS PURSUIT SHOULD SERVE AS AN INSPIRATION TO US THE CIVIC LEADERS. AND OUR SHARED GOAL OF APPROVED IMPROVING CALIFORNIA. DESPITE HUNDREDS OF YEARS OF BONDAGE AND SERVER TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAS A RICH SOCIETY THROUGH OUR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO PROMOTING UNITY. THE QUALITY AND OUR INGENUITY. IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT LET THIS STATE JUST BE A DAY OF CELEBRATION AS STATED. AND REMIND US THAT FREEDOM IS NOT FREE FREEDOM CAME WITH A HEAVY PRICE TAG AND THE LOSS OF LIFE. AS POLICY MAKERS WE MUST ENSURE THAT JUSTICE AND FREEDOM AND IT'S NATION IS NEVER LAW THAT THE LATE. BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT. WE TELL OUR REAL HISTORY IT'S IMPORTANT WE TELL A REAL REAL HISTORY AND NOT WHITE WASH AND SANITIZE NOT TO WHITEWASH AND SANITIZED VERSION ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

OF SLAVERY FILING LAWSUITS AGAINST THEIR SLAVE OWNERS AND REFUSING TO GIVE UP A SEAT IN A PHILADELPHIA TROLLEY BUT IT'S NOT FORGET THAT AMERICA'S HISTORY WAS CREATED BY MEN AND WOMEN.

NINETY ONE I HAD LOOK AT MY NOTES AND I THOUGHT OH I WROTE DOWN THE WRONG THING AND NOW I WILL CHANGE IT BACK THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. GOING TO START OVER. IT'S UP TO YOU. YOUR FIVE MINUTES BUT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. ALTHOUGH THE THEMES FOR AB. NINETY ONE OUR SIMPLICITY CLARITY AND POLICY. IT WILL KEEP TAX PREPARERS FULLY EMPLOYED AND SINCE I COME FROM THAT PROFESSION I GUESS THAT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD. THING TO DO -- BUT THEY WILL BE PREPARING TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT TAX RETURNS ONE FOR THE FORM TEN FORTY AND OTHER FOR THE FORM. FIVE FORTY CONFORMITY WHICH USED TO BE IN THE OLD DAYS JUST PULLING OUT THE AMOUNT YOU PAID IN STATE INCOME TAXES OFF OF THE FORM FIVE FORTY ARE PROBABLY LONG GUN. BUT THIS BILL IS A TAX INCREASE THAT WILL GENERATE AN ANTICIPATED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE PAY FOR AN INCREASE IN YOUR INCOME TAX. CREDIT REFUND OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY SO TAXES ACTUALLY THREE TIMES. THE AMOUNT OF THE PURPORTED PURPOSE FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA IS ALREADY THE HIGHEST TAX STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. SO AS A MAJOR PIECE OF TAX LEGISLATION THIS HAS NOT GONE THROUGH GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO HAVE HAD SOME PUBLIC DISCUSSION -- BUT IT IS NOW JUST GOING QUICKLY THROUGH BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW. AS A TRAILER BILL. YES THREE DISTRIBUTING WEALTH. IN A IN A PRETTY MASSIVE FORMAT WHICH SHOULD REQUIRE A PUBLIC DEBATE SO COLLEAGUES FOR THESE. AND OTHER REASONS I AM OPPOSED TO AB NINETY ONE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- SENATOR MORE LAW SENATOR RAZA [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I I RISE TO SUPPORT A. B.. NINETY ONE I DO HOWEVER HAVE A BIG CONCERN. HOUSEHOLDS THAT CONTRIBUTE ALMOST THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE AND LOCAL TAXES YET MANY ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE PROSPERITY THAT THEY ARE HELPING TO GENERATE FOR CALIFORNIA. JUST BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER THEY USE TO FILE THEIR TAXES OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. LOSE OUT THE MOST BECAUSE EVEN OF ONE PERSON IN THE HOUSEHOLD FILE THEIR TAXES WITH AN AYE TEN NUMBER THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS DENIED THE CREDIT. IF I TEN USERS MEET EVERY REQUIREMENT WHY ARE THEY LEFT OUT. WE TAKE THEIR TAXES AND EXCLUDE THEM FROM THIS CREDIT. CHILDREN OF THESE WORKING IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARE ALREADY TWICE AS LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY COMPARED TO CHILDREN IN WORKING NON IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THE GOAL HERE WAS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHILDREN ESPECIALLY FAMILIES WORKING FAMILIES ARE LIVING IN POVERTY. IT MAKES NO SENSE TO EXCLUDE THEM FOR THE CHILDREN AND THE FAMILIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE CAL E. I. T. C.. THE CALIFORNIA DREAM WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF REACH THANK YOU.
