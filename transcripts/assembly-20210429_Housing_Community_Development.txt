AND WITH THAT I THINK WE ARE READY TO PROCEED- SINCE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MEMBERS THAT ARE TRYING TO CATCH FLIGHTS AND OUR FIRST AUTHOR HAS TO CHAIR A MEETING THAT'S HAPPENING EXACTLY AT THIS MOMENT IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE. I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO JUMP TO FILE ITEM THIRTEEN A. B. ELEVEN THIRTY THREE ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE GRAYSON WHICH IS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING ALLOCATION ACT. MR GRAYSON. ALL. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU ASSEMBLY BILL. ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE. THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE CHRONIC LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. RECENT ESTIMATES SHOW THAT THE NEED TO PRODUCE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW AFFORDABLE UNITS ANNUALLY THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY NINE IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS. OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE PRODUCED AN AVERAGE OF JUST NINETEEN THOUSAND UNITS. WE ARE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AWAY FROM THE LEVELS OF PRODUCTION THAT WE NEED AND THE TRAGIC RESULTS CAN BE SEEN ON THE STREETS OF EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICTS. THE EXTENT OF THIS PROBLEM DEMANDS MORE THAN JUST A PIECEMEAL SOLUTION. WE NEED TO EXAMINE THE STRUCTURES THAT UNDERPIN OUR ENTIRE AFFORDABLE HOUSING-FINANCE SYSTEM. AND EXPLORE TRULY TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGES TO THE WAY WE ALLOCATE OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES. UNDERSCORING THIS POINT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR RECENTLY RELEASED A REPORT DETAILING SIGNIFICANT SHORTFALLS IN THE STATE'S APPROACH TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE. THE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE LACK OF A COORDINATED AND CENTRALIZED STRUCTURE FOR THE ALLOCATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESOURCES. HAS REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. DEVELOPERS INTERVIEWED FOR THE AUDIT EXPRESSED THE NEED FOR A SYSTEM THAT CONSOLIDATES AND COORDINATES MULTIPLE HOUSING RESOURCES INTO ONE CENTRALIZED PROCESS. THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT A STANDARD SET OF REQUIREMENTS CONSISTENT DEADLINES ANY SINGLE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS. WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DELAYS FOR APPLICANTS. BUT COULD ALSO INCREASE THE STATE'S SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE ONE ACT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING ALLOCATION ACT. WHICH WILL REQUIRE PCS SIX EIGHT. CAL HFA ANTIQUE ACT TO ESTABLISH AND OPERATE A SINGLE CENTRALIZED A CENTRALIZED HOUSING FUNDING ALLOCATION COMMITTEE UNDER B. C. A. S. H. THE COMMITTEE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLOCATING STATE CONTROLLED FINANCING. TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AND WILL SERVE AS THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR DEVELOPERS SEEKING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE THE COMMITTEE TO CREATE A UNIFIED APPLICATION AND AWARD PROCESS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF STATE CONTROLLED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS FINALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE SECRETARY A BCS ESTATES TO DEVELOP AN ORGANIZATIONAL PLAN. FOR THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT'S IN THE AGENCY TO STREAMLINE PROCESSES AND ELIMINATE REDUNDANT TASKS. AND TO SUBMIT A REPORT ON THAT PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE NO LATER THAN DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WITH ME TODAY TO DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL I HAVE TWO WITNESSES THE AUDIBLE BETTY CONTROL OF CALIFORNIA STATE CONTROLLER AND DINNER- JENNIFER SEVAK WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THANK YOU THIS TIME WE WILL GO TO OUR WITNESSES- ONE WE GO FIRST TO OUR STATE CONTROLLER. CONTROLLER YEE TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE OPEN A PER LINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY. AT THE CONTROLLER I SERVED AS A BOARD MEMBER OF P. CAT CONCERT LACK AND HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND. HOW WE THE STATE ARE IN OUR OWN WAY WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING AND BUILDING DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE THOSE SEEKING STATE SUPPORT TO FINANCE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH A GAUNTLET OF PROPHECIES AND REQUIREMENTS FROM NO LESS THAN FOR STATE DEPARTMENTS. THEREFORE I'M PLEASED TO SPONSOR AT ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH WILL STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS AND ENSURE WE DEPLOY OUR PUBLIC RESOURCE SUPPORT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE EFFECTIVELY. AB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE CREATES A ONE STOP SHOP FOR PORTABLE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO OBTAIN TAX EXEMPT BONDS STATE AND FEDERAL TAX CREDITS AND STATE SUBSIDIES LOANS. ALIGNING THE ALLOCATION OF THESE FUNDS UNDER A SINGLE ENTITY HAD PROCESS WILL HAVE THREE MAJOR BENEFITS. FIRST REDUCE THE TIME AND COST THE STAKEHOLDERS APPLYING FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH NEEDS FUNDING FROM THE STATE. CURRENTLY PROJECTS MUST GO THROUGH A MULTI YEAR PROCESS TO RECEIVE AWARDS FROM EACH CITY SAID BLACK AND TAKACS. IF THE PROJECT IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN ANY ONE COMPETITION DEVELOPERS MUST REAPPLY OFTEN MULTIPLE TIMES SLOWING THE TIMELINE AND INCREASING DEVELOPMENT COSTS. JUST LOOKS WEAK THE UC BERKELEY TURNER CENTER ISSUED A REPORT. ON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. IT THE RECOMMENDED TO CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP APPROACH. ON ONE SO SHOPPING. APPLIES FOR ALL STATE FUNDING SOURCES AT ONCE SHORTENING THE STATE'S FINANCES TIMELINE TO LESS THAN A YEAR. IN EACH APPLICATION CYCLE FOR PROJECT IS AWARDED IT WILL SHOULD RECEIVE ENOUGH FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT WITHOUT HAVING TO APPLY FOR OTHER STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS. SECONDLY IT REDUCING THE DUPLICATE OF WORKS THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING COMPLETED BY MULTIPLE STATE DEPARTMENTS OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON SPOKE ABOUT AND THAT'S ARTICULATED IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT. AND THIRD ALLOW FOR MORE EFFICIENT AND TIMELY DISTRIBUTION OF STATE CONTROLLED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO BLOCKS PRIVATE ACTIVITY BOND A WORK PROCESS BECAME OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE NOW HAVE TO BETTER COORDINATE OUR PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR LIMITED HOUSING RESOURCES. MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM H. CD IN THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL WAITING ON COMPETITIVE AWARDS FROM SUBCOMMITTEE CAC. TO FINALIZE THE FINANCING STRUCTURE. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE OUT FROM THE VOTERS APPROVED THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. BUT THESE BONDS ARE TAKING LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED TO BE UTILIZED. DUE TO THESE PROCESS INEFFICIENCIES. THIS BILL THE FIRST. BUT THE IS MORE WORK TO DO TO STAY. THE FOR LONG TERM COMPLIANCE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE GOVERNOR LET. OF THE CREDIT. INVESTMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITHOUT A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION SYSTEM. MUCH OF THE STATE FUNDING OF SLAVES TO THROUGH DELAYS AND UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY. AND THERE'S REALLY NO REASON TO WAIT UPON THAT THIS COMMONSENSE PROPOSAL THAT WILL INCREASE THE SPEED AND AMOUNT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO THE SECOND WITNESS. ON THIS AND THAT WOULD BE JENNIFER SPEC FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. BUT YOU SURE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER STACK WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS PARENTS HUNG SUPPORT. AB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE SEEKS TO CONSOLIDATE THE STATE'S HOUSING FINANCE FUNCTIONS INTO A SINGLE LOCATION WITH A SINGLE PLANNING APPLICATION. HOUSING IS IN HIGH DEMAND BUT IN SHORT SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA IS WE'VE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF HOUSING SHORTAGE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY. TWO COOPERATIVE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A SOUND WELL COORDINATED STRATEGY OR PLAN FOR HOW TO MOST EFFECTIVELY USE ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHORTAGE LACK OF COORDINATED HOUSING PLAN IS EVIDENT IN ITS FOR AGENCIES. MISALIGNED INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS THEY ADMINISTER. FURTHERMORE THE NEED FOR OUR STABLE AND HOW BEEN ONE OF THE- PRIORITY FOR. FAMILIES BIG FURNITURE HOUSING ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COMMITMENT CALIFORNIANS UNDERTAKEN THEIR DAY TO DAY LIVES. FURTHERMORE HOUSING AND HOUSING RELATED ACTIVITIES ARE OF PRIMARY IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE AND WARRANTS LIKE CLEAR IN UNIFIED FOCUS OF STATE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLIC TO PERMANENT SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING AND APPROVED OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES DEDICATED HOUSING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE ONLY EXPECTED TO GET MORE COMPLICATED AS WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. AND ESTABLISH MORE RESOURCES. FOR THOSE FOLLOWING THE STATE POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS AND THERE'S CLEARLY BEEN A LACK OF INTER AGENCY COORDINATION. COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN OFTEN LEADS TO COMPETING PROGRAMS ARE DEPICTED AFFECTS. THE LACK OF COORDINATED AND CENTRALIZE STRUCTURES TO MANAGEMENT AND ALLOCATION OF HOUSING RESOURCES. HAS REDUCED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STATE'S RESPONSE TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. CREATING A ONE STOP SHOP FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE WILL REDUCE REDUNDANT PROCESSES. CREATE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND MAKE BETTER USE OF THE STATE'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING DOLLARS. MAYBE ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE WILL HELP FOCUS THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY CRISIS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE- RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TRY THOUGH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THEIR TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME WE WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION- LIKE TO INVITE UP- THE TREASURER OF OUR STATE TREASURER MARK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR CHU AND YOUR COMMITTEE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS. WHEN I WAS ELECTED STATE TREASURER IN TWENTY NINETEEN I HOSTED A FIFTEEN CITY LISTENING TOUR. AS CHAIR UP TO CATCH AND SEDLAK I PERSONALLY CHAIRED AND ATTENDED EVERY MEETING IN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THAT'S TWENTY ONE SAID LIKE MEETINGS AND FOURTEEN T. CAC MEETINGS LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR WE WERE COLLABORATIVE LEE WAS CITIES COUNTIES LOCAL AUTHORITIES DEVELOPERS AND ATTORNEYS TO COMPLETE A MAJOR OVERHAUL. OF THE SAID LACK ANTI CAP REGULATIONS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN FIFTEEN YEARS. WE ALSO APPROVED A RECORD NUMBER OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND ARE ON TRACK THIS YEAR TO EXCEED LAST YEAR'S NUMBERS. WE ALSO EXPEDITED OUR REGULATORY REFORM PROCESS TO QUICKLY IMPLEMENT AB ONE OH ONE. WE FIX LEGACY ISSUES LIKE THE CARRY FORWARD ISSUE THAT WAS MENTIONED IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHICH WAS WHICH HAPPENED UNDER TO. UP TREASURES AGO. WE OVERSAW A NEW NINETY EIGHT MILLION FEDERAL DISASTER TAX CREDIT PROGRAM CALLAGY IF THEY WON A NATIONAL AWARD FOR OUR JOINT APPLICATION PROCESS WE ROLLED OUT A NEW T. CATCH AND SAID LIKE JOINT APPLICATION THIS YEAR. EIGHTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR REQUIRES H. C. D. TO BETTER ALIGN THEIR SIX MAJOR FUNDING SOURCES AND THEY WILL ALSO BETTER ALIGN WITH PARTY CAC AND SEDLAK PROCESSES. TO PUT IT IN THE SIMPLEST FORMS SIMPLEST TERMS THE SYSTEM IS WORKING. I CAN SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST EFFICIENT OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR ALLOCATING AND AWARDING TAX CREDITS AND BONDS COMPARED TO ANY OTHER STATE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO ELECTED OFFICIALS AND RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS. ME EMPHASIZES AGAIN. IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS OUR SYSTEM IS WORKING. CERTAINTY OF EXECUTION IS KEY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS PROPOSING A WHOLE NEW OVERHAUL AT THIS TIME IS RISKY AND CREATES UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKET PLACE. THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST. INSTEAD OF EXPEDITING HOUSING THIS LEGISLATION COULD UNINTENTIONALLY HAMPERING. IT COULD BURY THE FOR HOUSING AGENCIES UNDER ANOTHER LEVEL OF BUREAUCRACY. IT WILL FORCE A DISRUPTIVE TRANSITION AT A TIME WHEN WHAT IS NEEDED IS STEADFASTNESS STEADY STEADINESS. AND I BELIEVE IT WILL STIFLE AND SLOW DOWN OUR CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION WHICH IS PERFORMING AT ITS HIGHEST LEVEL THAN EVER. I ALSO BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE A SEPARATION OF DUTIES BETWEEN HOUSING POLICY AND HOUSING FINANCING. IN THE PAST THERE HAVE BEEN GOVERNOR'S THAT DID NOT SUPPORT FOR WORK IN DIFFERENT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO HAVING ALL THE HOUSING DECISIONS AND FINANCING UNDER ONE ROOF WOULD REMOVE COMPETITION AND CREATE A POLITICAL SYSTEM WHERE STAFF PICKS AND CHOOSES THEIR FAVORITE PROJECTS. I REAFFIRM THAT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SHOULD BE THE POLICY ARM AND THE CHARGERS OFFICE SHOULD BE THE FINANCING ARM. WE ARE WORKING COLLABORATIVE LEE WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES AND ARE SURPASSING EXPECTATIONS AS WE STRIVE TO HIT THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL A THREE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW HOMES BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF REFORM WHEN NEEDED. I WAS ELECTED TO THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. AND WHEN I CHAIRED THE BOARD IN MY SECOND YEAR. I REQUESTED THREE OUTSIDE AUDITS THAT RESULTED IN THE LARGEST REFORM. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HISTORY AND MOVE THE ADMINISTRATION AN APPEALS PROCESS UNDER THE GOVERNOR WHICH WAS MUCH NEEDED. HOWEVER THE STATE'S HOUSING AGENCIES IS A DIFFERENT SCENARIO. THE MAIN PROBLEM WE HAVE MEMBERS IS THE LACK OF BOND ALLOCATION WHICH IS LIMITED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND IS OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S CONTROL. WE NEED COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING SOLUTIONS NOT A PIECEMEAL APPROACH AS A FORMER LEGISLATURE LEGISLATOR MAJORITY WHIP AND SPEAKER PRO TEM OF THE ASSEMBLY AND ACTIVE AND ACCESSIBLE STATE OFFICER. I FULLY COMMIT TO WORKING WITH YOU TO GET US THERE. HOWEVER THIS BILL AS PROPOSED IS NOT WHAT IS NEEDED AND MAY EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS NOT GOING TO CREATE OR EXPEDITE NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S GO TO THE SECOND OPPOSITION WITNESS MISTER BEN BARKER FROM THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL FINANCE A THIRTY. FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK CHAIR CHIU IN YOUR COMMITTEE FOR THE LEADERSHIP FOR THE LEADERSHIP WORKING TO HELP FIX THE HOUSING CRISIS I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE HONORABLE TREASURE MOFFETT LEADERSHIP AND GUIDANCE. THROUGH THE MAJOR OVERHAUL OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING REGULATIONS THAT HAPPENED THROUGHOUT THE LAST TWO YEARS. I AM BEN BARKER FINANCIAL ADVISER TO THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL FINANCE AUTHORITY ALSO KNOWN AS THE SEEM OF FAYE WHICH IS THE MOST ACTIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONDUIT BOND ISSUER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE ISSUED BONDS FOR HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ONE POINT OF REFERENCE THE CM A FACE EMITTED MORE THAN SIXTY FIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING APPLICATIONS. TO SAID LIKE ANTIQUE ACT IN THE FIRST ROUND OF THIS YEAR. THIS IS MORE THAN ALL OTHER ISSUERS COMBINED IN THE STATE. AS THE LARGEST AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE WHERE WE'RE SURPRISED THAT NOBODY HAS REACHED OUT FOR OUR INPUT ON THIS BILL. AB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOUSING ALLOCATION ACT ADDRESSES THE WRONG ISSUES. OVERWHELMING ISSUE WITH HOUSING ALLOCATION IS THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS MORE. THE FEDERAL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I'M SORRY THE STATE RECEIVES AROUND FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF ALLOCATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND WE COULD USE MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CANNOT CHANGE THAT ONLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAMP. YESTERDAY SAID LIKE ALLOCATED MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS WELL IT HAD REQUEST FOR OVER THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN BONDS. IT IN OTHER WORDS WE'RE THREE TIMES OVERSUBSCRIBED. AND THIS IS MORE THAN ANY OTHER ROUND IN THE HISTORY OF SELECT WHICH SHOWS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY WORKING. CALIFORNIA AFFORDABLE MULTI FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING PROJECTS ARE LARGELY FINANCED BY. TAXES ON BONDS AND TAX CREDITS ONE OF THE CRITICAL TENETS TO FINANCE HIS CERTAINTY OF EXECUTION. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPEN UNDERSTANDABLE TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE PROCESS FOR AWARDING ALLOCATION OF STATE CEILING. ON QUALIFIED PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS. THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN REFINED OVER MANY YEARS AND MOVING AND MOVING THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW WOULD PROVIDE UNCERTAIN INTEREST. NEITHER WHICH WILL HELP DURING A HOUSING CRISIS MY PARTNERS AND I IN A DIFFERENT CAPACITY HAVE FACILITATED TAX EXEMPT BOND TRANSACTIONS IN OVER THIRTY FIVE STATES. THE ALLOCATION OF VOLUME CAP IN OTHER STATES IS LESS. EFFICIENT TRANSPARENT AND EFFECTIVE IN CALIFORNIA THE LARGEST U. AS THE LARGEST USER USER OF THIS PROGRAM WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY MOVING THE ALLOCATION PROCESS FROM THE TREASURE'S OFFICE WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE TO SOMEWHERE ELSE WE BELIEVE THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT AND WE WORKED DILIGENTLY WITH THE STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS UP. STATEMENT FOR THE SAID LIKE REGULATIONS TO MAKE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALLOCATION PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT. EVERYTHING CONTAINED WITHIN THIS BILL CAN BE DONE PROCEDURALLY. THERE IS NO FIX IS THE NEED TO BE DONE ON A LEGISLATIVE LEVEL. CURRENTLY THIS IS ALL IN PROCESS BETWEEN KICKED HE TEXTED LACK H. IN COLLEGE AFFECT FOR A ONE FOR ONE APPLICATION ONE STOP PROCESS. AGAIN THIS IS NOT NEED TO BE DONE UNDER LEGISLATIVE MANNER. THE LAST THING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY NEEDS IS REVAMPING THE PROCESS RIGHT AFTER THE STAKEHOLDERS WORKED FOR YEARS TO REPENT DIDN'T GO TO THE LARGEST REVAMP TO HAPPEN LAST YEAR. AGAIN THIS CREATES UNCERTAINTY AND THE LACK OF EXECUTION. THIS BILL WILL NOT PRODUCE A SINGLE UNIT. OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL NOW GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO. EDUCATOR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL IF THERE ANY MEMBERS IN THE HEARING ROOM. IF THERE ANY NUMBERS ON THE ROUTE LINE.

THANK ARE MUCH ON A BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE- I WANT TO STATE A FEW WORDS- JUST TO LET MY PERSPECTIVE I KNOW A NUMBER OF YOU HAVE COME UP TO ME THE LAST FEW HOURS ASKING ABOUT THIS. LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I HAVE- SURE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR TREASURE. I KNOW SHE IS DOING THE BEST SHE CAN DURING THIS TIME PERIOD FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THIS AND LET THE RECORD REFLECT MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS BILL DOES NOT REFLECT ANYTHING ON HER LEADERSHIP OR HER WORK- AND I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT- THE TREASURE AND I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK ABOUT THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME A FEW DAYS AGO. WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE OPPOSITION- AFTER RATES UP THE BILL AND INDICATED MY SUPPORT FOR THIS CONVERSATION- LET ME SAY THIS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE COMPLEXITY. OF STATE FINANCING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS LONG BEEN AN ISSUE. THIS IS PREDATED THIS GOVERNOR PREDATED THIS TREASURE THIS CONTROLLER AS WE HAVE. BEEN TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS I THINK IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THAT IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE INFUSED MORE MORE MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. OUR PRIVATE ACTIVITY BOND HAS BECOME MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE THAT COMPLEXITY HAS INTENSIFIED AND THE REALITY IS WE'VE HAD FOUR DIFFERENT ENTITIES HCD. TELL EACH OF A. T. CAC SET LACK. THAT ARE ALL PART OF THIS PUZZLE- AND I THINK IT'S ALSO FAIR TO SAY THEY'RE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON WHETHER. HE'S HOUSING SYSTEMS ARE WORKING AND WHETHER THIS IS THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY THAT WE CAN DO IT- AND I HAVE THOUGHT IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE BETTER ALIGN OUR HOUSING FINANCING SYSTEM. WHICH IS WHY I THOUGHT INITIALLY WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. UP TO OTHER OBSERVATIONS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NONE OF US IF WE HAD BUILT THE SYSTEM FROM SCRATCH WOULD HAVE DIVIDED THE RESPONSIBILITIES UP IN THE WAY THAT WE HAVE- BUT GIVEN WHERE WE ARE. IT'S A FAIR QUESTION A WHAT WE DO MOVING FORWARD- AND THEN ALSO JUST POINT OUT AND THIS I KNOW IS SOMETHING THAT WE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR. THIS BILL DOES NOT ELIMINATE. THESE AGENCIES IT SIMPLY SAYS THAT WE ARE ASKING OR SAID J. THE JOINT ESTABLISHED. AND THE OP. OF A SINGLE HOUSING FUNDING ALLOCATION COMMITTEE SO- NUANCE IN THIS- BUT I HAVE ASKED THE AUTHOR. IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD FROM THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE. THE DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS TOPIC I SUSPECT HE- KNOWS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND- AND I KNOW HE'S COMMITTED TO DOING THAT SO. JUST WANTED TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE AND OF COURSE OPEN UP TO OTHERS FOR COMMENT. MISTER CAR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND I THINK THAT YOU LAID OUT OF A PERSPECTIVE IN AND- THE THAT I THINK- I SHARE. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR AND I KNOW THAT HE- PUTS A LINE A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY TRYING TO FIND. COLLABORATION AND- IN IN GETTING TO- THE END RESULT I ALSO TREMENDOUS RESPECT FOR OUR TREASURER KNOWS THAT SHE'S SHE DOES THE SAME. I DON'T KNOW BASED UPON- THE- NATURE OF THE OPPOSITION THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ABILITY TO GET TO THAT COMPROMISED POSITION BUT I CERTAINLY WANT TO GIVE THE AUTHOR THE BENEFIT OF THE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY- AND YOU KNOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD I THINK THERE'S CERTAINLY ROOM FOR SO EFFICIENCIES BUT- MID TO THE UPPER OF THE TREASURES POINT THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF GREAT WORK DONE UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. GETTING IN OUR OWN WAY OF THAT WELL TRYING TO FIND AN EFFICIENT MANNER REARDING THE FUNDING AND I DON'T PRETEND TO KNOW WHAT THE END SOLUTION IS BUT I DO. TRUST THE AUTHOR THE TO PUT THE TIME AND ENERGY AND TO TRY TO GET TO THAT POINT SO I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT WITH THAT WITH THOSE CADETS AND APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK. IS PUT IN. BEEN PUT INTO IT. THANK YOU LETTER KNOWLEDGE. ABOUT OUR COLLEAGUES AND NETWORK. THEY YOU CHAIR WHEN THEY THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS. ON AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BILL AS PRESENTED IN SOME OF THE- STORIES YOU HEAR OUT IN THE COMMUNITY FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS ARE THOSE TRYING TO SEEK FUNDING. WE KNOW THAT CENTRALIZING THESE OPPORTUNITIES INTO ONE SPACE CAN BE A GOOD THING- DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY AND HOW SOMETIMES THE INTER RELATE WITH EACH OTHER. I THINK REALLY NECESSITATE THAT WE NEED THAT COORDINATION IT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR FROM OUR TREASURER AS WELL. THAT THEE OBSERVATIONS THAT SHE'S ACTIVELY WORKING ON RIGHT NOW AND I APPRECIATE IT. VERY STRONGLY YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL THAT YOU BROUGHT AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. ALL THE WORK YOU ARE DOING YOU CONTINUE TO DO AND YOU WILL BE DOING IN THE FUTURE- INTO SPACE AND AS I'M TRYING TO KIND OF RECONCILE THIS I DON'T WANT THIS TO BECOME- FOR ME MAYBE A TURF WAR. I WANT THIS TO WORK WELL. AND AS YOU'RE CONSIDERING AND THANK YOU ON. SOME OF OUR GRAYSON AS WELL FOR. YOUR INTERESTING CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL THESE PARTIES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- I HAVE HEARD FROM AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IN MY DISTRICT- AND SOME OF THOSE HAD DIALED IN TODAY AS WELL WITH THEIR CONCERN AND SO WHEN I'M- WHEN I'M WHEN I'M NERVOUS ABOUT- I THINK WHAT I'M- MAYBE UPPER FLOODING ON THEIR NERVOUSNESS IS THAT. YOU KNOW WHETHER MAYBE IMPERFECTIONS WHILE WE CAN BE WORKING ON SOME OF THESE IT PROCESS FISHING SEES. THEY DO KNOW HOW TO WORK THE SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE PROJECTS WORKING WE CAN'T DISRUPT. THAT EITHER AND SO IF WE ARE STILL HARD. PASSED ON SENDING US. YOU KNOW- DEEP BE ABLE TO SEE. THESE ASSIST. AND OPERATE AND- WE MIGHT BE INJECTING A LITTLE BIT OF RISK AND THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD BE US SPELL SOME DANGER- I. MIGHT INVITE YOU TO CONSIDER IS YOU'RE CONSIDERING SOME THESE IMPROVEMENTS- KEY- SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT MAYBE NOT A HARD FAST TRIGGER DATE. I CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE WHAT A STRUCTURE COULD LOOK LIKE ABOUT SOME KIND OF A UNIFORM OUT LOCATION AND YOU KNOW SORT OF A CONSOLIDATED EFFORT HERE- BETWEEN ALL THESE ENTITIES- BUT MAYBE THAT TRIGGERED IT WOULD BE ON THE CONDITION. OF AN AGREEMENT. BETWEEN THE HEAD AND- HEAD. LEADERS OF EACH OF THOSE ENTITIES OF HFA IN B. C. S. H. AN EIGHT CITY THX AT LAX- AND THEN I THINK THE- OTHER KEY POINT AS WELL. IS WHO IS REALLY GOING TO BE THE THAT THE CONVENER OF ALL THIS WHETHER THAT'S HOUSING PCS AGE. WELL THAT'S HOUSED IN THE C. TREASURER'S OFFICE HAVING TO RAISE A GOOD POINT ABOUT A SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUE- I THINK THOSE ARE. MAYBE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DRILL INTO AND EVERYTHING SO I'D LIKE TO. BE ABLE TO SEE THIS MOVE FOR IT COULD BE HELPFUL. TO THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THIS- WORKING ON THE DETAILS. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE- JUST EVERYTHING. LIKE TO KNOW SHOW SOME. WHAT THANK YOU MISTER SHE- AND I. TO THANK YOU THREE THE BILL UP I WANT TO LINE. COMMENTS WITH. THE THAT ARE MADE. MY MAKE. FROM SAN DIEGO IN SAN JOSE AS WELL- I DO BELIEVE THE TREASURES BEEN DOING GREAT WORK- AND HAS BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TRYING TO STREAMLINE AND BRINGS TOGETHER I THINK THE AUTHOR IN THE TREASURE SHARE THE SAME. OVERALL GOAL- TO ENSURE THAT. WE CAN BUILD MORE QUICKLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT SO DESPERATELY- SO I THINK WE'RE ALL. WORKING TOWARDS THE RIGHT GOAL. I WOULD JUST URGE THE AUTHOR WHO I THINK IS- WELL RESPECTED AND NOW. A GREAT AUTHOR ON AND VERY THOROUGH. JUST TO CONTINUE TO HAVE DIALOGUE- WITH THE TREASURE WITH OPPOSITION AND FOLKS THAT CALLED IN AND MAKING SURE THAT WERE REALLY FLUSHING THIS OUT. OF NOT HAVING ANY SORT OF NEGATIVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST WANNA- ECHOED THE SAME COMMENTS AND- ALSO FOR THE BILL TODAY BUT- HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY YOU'LL- YOU'LL KEEP ON. AT MORE DIALOGUE IS NEEDED THANK YOU. ANY FINAL. TO REVISED. THANK YOU ARE SO I AGREE WITH ALL THE COMMENTS WE'VE HEARD SO FAR AND I THINK WE'RE WE STRUGGLE SOMETIMES IS WHAT WE HEAR AND FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS OUT THERE INCLUDING THE PEOPLE WHO BUILD THESE FIRST THESE ARE COMMUNITIES- AND THEN WHAT WE HEARING HERE AND WHAT I FIND OUT WHAT I WHAT I GRAPPLE WITH IS IT SOMETIMES. THERE ARE PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT THE CURRENT PROCESS AND ARE JUST LIKE I JUST WANT TO DO THAT AND BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE AGAIN AND THEN THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HOPELESSLY STRUGGLING TO GET THEIR PROJECTS THROUGH THIS UNCOORDINATED SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BECOME COORDINATED THEY JUST DON'T KNOW YET- SO YOU KNOW AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I KIND OF WENT ON THAT AND THAT'S OF THE Y. JOIN YOU ON THIS IS. IS IT YOU KNOW IT I THINK THESE ONE STOP SHOP A CONCEPTS ARE GOOD IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TAKING OUT ANY PARTICULAR AGE ENTITY BUT IT'S HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM WHO MIGHT NOT BE AS FAMILIAR SOME OF THESE OTHER FOLKS GET IN AND YOU GET INTO A PROCESS WHERE IT'S NOT SO FRUSTRATING I KNOW AND- THERE CITIES IN MY DISTRICT ARE. TRYING DESPERATELY TO MEET THEIR AFFORDABLE HOUSING RENO NUMBERS AND THERE ARE THESE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN SITTING IN THE IN THE HOPPER FOR THREE OR FOUR YEARS NOW WITH THIS FINANCING DILEMMA AND- AND YES PART OF IT IS A BONDING WE CAN FIX THAT IF WE KNOW WHAT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS- SO I LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS MOVE FORWARD. AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE- WELL RESPECTED TREASURER ON ON IT SEEN EXACTLY WHAT THINGS ARE GOING TO BE HAPPENING THAT ARE GOING TO FIX THIS PROBLEM- BUT I YEAH CONCEPT OF STREAMLINING ENABLE ENABLING PEOPLE HAVE ONE STOP SHOP I THINK IS A GOOD CONCEPT AND NOT AND THAT'S. WHY I'M SUPPORTING IT TODAY. MR CALLING. I THINK THAT'S GOOD QUICK QUESTION TREASURE. A TREASURY RIGHT HERE IN YOUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION THAT- THAT THE BUREAUCRATIC OVERHAUL THAT AB ELEVEN THIRTY FIVE CALLS FOR WOULD UNDERMINE MANY OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS REFORMS AND SYNERGIES. I THAT IT PUT IN PLACE- GOOD TIME YOU'VE BEEN CHARGED TO COMMITTEES WHAT REASON YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IF THEY HAVE A NEW HOME THAT YOU KNOW YOUR REFORMS WOULD BE ACTIVELY UNDERMINED A REVERSED. YES SO. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I BELIEVE THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN. DIFFERENT AGENCIES- AND THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS RIGHT NOW THERE IS A CHECK AND BALANCE THERE IS. A SEPARATION OF DUTIES WE ARE ALL RESPONSIVE TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. INDIVIDUALLY AND I JUST WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT IN NEW YORK WHERE EVERYTHING IS UNDER ONE ROOF. IT TAKES EIGHT YEARS. FOR THEM TO GET PROJECT THEM EIGHT YOUR PIPELINE. AND IF YOU ASK ANY OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE ON THE LINE ASK THEM HOW LONG IT TAKES. TO OUR SYSTEM GIVEN THAT THEY EITHER HAVE THE FUNDING MECHANISM OR- THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS WE HAVE THREE ROUNDS EVERY YEAR. AND THEY ARE ALL ABLE TO COMPETE AND THEY COMPETE BASED ON A VERY TRANSPARENT POINT SYSTEM- WHAT PEOPLE CAN WATCH OUR YOU KNOW OUR OUR MEETINGS. AND SO WE HAVE A VERY VERY EFFICIENT SYSTEM COMPARED TO EVERY OTHER STATE AND SO IF THE SYSTEM ISN'T BROKE. WHY DO WE WANT TO CHANGE IT. SO HAVING THE GOVERNOR I WE BOTH GOT ELECTED TWO YEARS AGO WE ARE BOTH ALIGNED IN OUR MISSION. AND SAID YOU KNOW ACHIEVING HIS GOAL OF THREE POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES AND I'VE DONE A LOT. OF THE LAST TWO YEARS TO. MAKE THIS AGENCY MORE EFFICIENT ESPECIALLY ALIGNING TAKEN SAID LACK LIKE UNDER ONE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHICH IS MADE A TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE NOW JOINT APPLICATIONS WHICH HAS NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE SO WE ARE MAKING GREAT STRIDES- WE- APPROVED MORE HOUSING UNITS. LAST YEAR. SOMEONE I THINK SOMEONE TALK ABOUT NINETEEN THOUSAND UNITS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. LAST YEAR WE APPROVED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND UNITS IN AGAIN THE PROBLEM IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE ARE LIMITED BY UPON CAPACITY. WE ARE WORKING ON RECYCLING BONDS- CHANGING THE LIMIT FROM 5225% SO THAT WE CAN UTILIZE MORE. OF OUR BOND CAPACITY AND ALSO LOOKING TO OTHER STATES TO SEE WHETHER WE CAN PURCHASE. UP TAX CREDITS AND BONDS THAT THERE USING. WE HAVE SUCH A GREAT NEEDS SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT I'M NOT ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE TREASURES. AND THIS IS TOP PRIORITY FOR ME TO. TO GET SOME MORE BOND CAPACITY HERE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THE NEW YORK EXAMPLES INTERESTING SO YOU THINK THAT THIS MIGHT ACTUALLY SLOW THE PROCESS DOWN IF WE CONSOLIDATE THINGS YEAH I WAS ON THE PHONE CALL WITH THE DEVELOPERS TWO DAYS AGO. AND THEY SAID THAT THE SYSTEM NOW. YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR PROJECT IS GOING TO GET APPROVED IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE STAFF. AND WHAT PROJECTS THEY WANT TO APPROVED SO THERE'S NO TRANSPARENCY NO ACCOUNTABILITY NO PUBLIC MEETING. AND NO SYSTEM WHERE DEVELOPERS KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMPETING WELL ARE NOT COMPETING THEY BASICALLY WAIT. AND HOPE THAT THEY GET CALLED. THANK YOU. MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ARE ALL JUST A LINE MY COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM OAKLAND WHICH I GUESS WOULD BE THE TRANSITIVE PROPERTY AS EVERYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE- BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK THE THANK AUTHOR I KNOW YOU'RE A DEEPLY RESPECTED VOICE ON THESE ISSUES ALSO. YOU KNOW HAVE A FIRST HAND KNOWLEDGE OF HOW DEEPLY RESPECTED THE TREASURE IS ON THESE ISSUES AND HOW WIDESPREAD THE ADMIRATION IS ME FOR A HOUSING COMMUNITY FOR THE WORK THAT SHE'S DONE MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP I THINK THAT'S UNDER HER LEADERSHIP I THINK THAT'S EVIDENT TO EVERYBODY HERE- YOU KNOW BEING THAT THIS IS THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE- IN THE FIRST HOUSE- AND THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS- YOU KNOW LOOK FOR TO THOSE CONTINUE TO PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ARE. DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THIS BUT IT'S A IT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE ONCE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR FOCUSING ON IT- AND I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU ANY FINAL. I'M GONNA MAKE ONE FINAL COMMENT WHICH IS AN ASPECT OF THIS BILL THAT I THINK CAN BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE SUPPORT OF THE SPONSORS AS WELL AS THE OPPOSITION CAN AGREE ON AND I JUST WANNA POINT OUT WHICH IS REQUIRES A PLAN. WORKING WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESSES AROUND PROGRAM GUIDELINES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DISPARATE AROUND APPLICATIONS AROUND THE COMPILING PROJECT DATA MONITORING THE PROJECT FINANCIALS PHYSICAL PROPERTY INSPECTIONS DETAILS ON HOUSING DATA AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST SIDES WHEREVER THE DISCUSSION LANDS ON WHETHER THE SHOULD BE CENTRALIZED IN ONE ENTITY OF THAT WORK HAS TO GET DONE AND THAT FOR ME IS ALSO YOU KNOW REASON WHY AT LEAST I HOPE THIS VEHICLE MOVES FORWARD- TO CREATE SOME CONSENSUS AROUND THAT BUT THAT BEING SAID MISTER ANY FINAL COMMENTS. LET ME ASK YOU AUTHOR OF UNITY FOR CLOSING REMARKS YES PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO START OFF BY FOOTBALL THING I'VE HEARD ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS AND- THEY HAVE RESONATED AND I WILL CONTINUE- TO WORK WITH ALL PARTIES AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED AND IMPACTED HAVING REACHED OUT AS EARLY AS FEBRUARY TWO- THE STATE TREASURER- TO START ENGAGEMENT IN THAT CONVERSATION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THAT IS MY DESIRE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THAT CONSENSUS AND BRING US TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BETTER ESPECIALLY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND- WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WHAT WE ARE FACING AS A CRISIS- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WINNING ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE FINANCING OF IT. YES THERE ARE A FEW NATIONAL CONGLOMERATES THAT HAVE LEARN THE SYSTEM AND HAVE THE LEGAL RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO NAVIGATE BUT FOR RIGHT NOW- THERE ARE MANY THAT CAN'T NAVIGATE AND ARE BUILDING OR DESIRING TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE CHALLENGES ARE MUCH BIGGER THAN ONE SINGLE STATE AGENCY. AND I APPLAUD I ABSOLUTELY- COMMEND AND APPLAUD. THE STATE TREASURER FOR THE GREAT I WORK. THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON HER PURVIEW AND TIME. AND OFFICE BUT THE CHALLENGES REMAIN LARGER THAN A STATE AGENCY OR A PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT SO WITH THAT I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE STATE WATER THE TURNER CENTER AND MY WITNESSES ARE NOT A RESULT OF ACTION. OR IN ACTION BY ANY INDIVIDUAL AGENCY OR ADMINISTRATION. THE REALITY IS THAT THE CURRENT DYSFUNCTION IN OUR STATES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM. IS A SYMPTOM OF A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT IS LARGER THAN ANY ONE OFFICE. SO WE NEED A SOLUTION OF THE TO COMMENSURATE WITH THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM. AND I BELIEVE THIS BILL WILL SET US ON A PATH. TO IMPLEMENTING JUST SUCH A SOLUTION AGAIN I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING. ADDRESSING ALL THE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP TODAY AFTER SOME NOTES. AND CONSIDERING THE DATE AND OTHER THINGS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

GABRIELLE KALRA KALRA I KILEY HIGHLY NO. WAR WAR I QUICKSILVER QUICKSILVER I WEEKS. Q. THE CITY FOUR FOUR TWO ONE SEVEN ONE YOU NEED ONE MORE VOTE AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S NOT GO TO MS DAVIES ITEM WHICH IS FILE ITEM NINE EIGHTY FIVE OH TWO I WILL NOTE THAT THIS ENJOYS A TO PASS RECOMMENDATION FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE OR TWO. AT FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF TO AMEND THE BILL IN A WAY THAT. ADDS PROTECTION AND ON VACATION FOR ELECTIONS GOING FORWARD I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW WHEN IT H. AWAY HOLD AN ELECTION FOR ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO RUN FOR OPEN POSITIONS THEY MUST STILL GO THROUGH ALL THE FINANCIAL PROCEDURES OF HAVING ELECTION. THIS PLACE PLACES A HUGE BURDEN ON HOAS AND ULTIMATELY THE COST FOR THESE I NEEDED ELECTIONS GET FUNNELED DOWN TO THE HOMEOWNERS AND THE TENANTS. A FEW YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATOR PASSED A MEASURE TO ALLEVIATE THIS SITUATION BY ALLOWING LARGE HOAS TO DO A VOTE BY ACCLAMATION. IF THE EXACT NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP FOR THE RUN. FOR POSITION MATCHES THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS OPEN. THAT WAS SB SEVEN FIVE FOUR. UNFORTUNATELY THE MEASURE ONLY APPLIED TO EACH ALWAYS WAS SIX THOUSAND OR MORE UNITS. SMALL H. O. AS WERE LEFT OUT. AB FIVE UP TO IS A SIMPLE MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT THESE SAME ELECTION PROCEDURES MAY APPLY TO THE HL HOAS OF ANY SIZE. I SHOULD NOTE THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE ELECTION PROCEDURES UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. IF MORE PEOPLE SIGNED UP TO RUN IN OPEN POSITIONS. THEN THIS BILL DOES NOT COME INTO PLAY A REGULAR ELECTION SHALL HAPPEN. IN ADDITION WHAT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WE'D GIVEN THE-HOMEOWNERS AN ADDITIONAL. NINETY DAYS NOTICE UPON UPCOMING ELECTIONS ON TOP OF THE EXISTING THIRTY DA NOTICE. LASTLY ACCORDING TO STAKEHOLDERS DATA FOR AB FIVE A TWO THERE ARE ONLY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR SO SHE ISSUES WITH A THOUSAND OR MORE UNITS IN CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING. 1% OF THE TOTAL 60% OF THE ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA FIFTY UNITS OR LESS TOTALING MORE THAN THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. 52% OF THE ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA HAVE BUDGETS OF LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THE EXPENSE OF AN ON ELECTION COULD BE SIGNIFICANT. AND I JUST LIKE TO SHARE PERSONAL NOTES- I HAVE SERVED ON MY H. AWAY FOR TEN YEARS I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY- BUT I STAYED ON UNTIL JANUARY. AND UP SO I WENT THROUGH THIS AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT- FOR THE TEN YEARS I SERVED ON IT. THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I'M STILL ON BECAUSE NOBODY WANTED TO RUN FOR THE H. AWAY. AND WHEN WE DID DO ELECTIONS WE COULD NEVER GET A QUORUM SO WE HAD TO GO BACK AND SEE MALIN MAIL IN MAIL AND TO THE POINT WHERE. AGAIN WE STILL NEVER HAD ENOUGH VOTES AND I CAN TELL YOU ESPECIALLY DURING THE RECESSION AND DURING CALL THAT. THE LACK OF INCOME JOB LOSS THIS IS SUCH A BURDENSOME TO HAVE TO INCREASE H. ALWAYS AS A COSTS GO UP- IN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF- FAMILIES THAT ARE. YOU KNOW RAISING KIDS AS WELL AS A LOT OF SENIORS ON FIXED INCOMES SO NOT HAVING A REYES IT SHOWED.

MCCARTY SAID RUN FOR ELECTION OF THE BOARD OF OUR LOCAL ASSOCIATION TWICE. THE FIRST TIME UNSUCCESSFULLY- BEING A THIRD LEADING VOTE GETTER ONE TWO WERE ELECTED AND THEN ARAMBULA ACTION THE NEXT TIME AROUND AND WAS SUCCESSFUL. I WANT TO TAKE A- DAVIS CERVANTES CALL FOR REFLECTION I THINK WILL BENEFIT ALL COMMUNITY INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND A MEMBER RESIDENTS BY ALLOWING ELECTION DIRECTORS BY ACCLAMATION. IN THE CASE OF UNCONTESTED ELECTIONS. THIS WILL ENABLE BOARDS TO BETTER MANAGE H. AWAY BUDGETS AND RESOURCES BY FOCUSING ON BUDGETING PRIORITIES SUCH AS MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS. WHICH TO BENEFIT. ALL RESIDENTS AND MEMBERS. I WILL NOTABLE. CONTEST A LOT MAY BE MINOR KEPT ALIVE GREAT AND SMALL ESOS. LIKE OURS. ON A PER UNIT BASIS ON LARGER. WERE ALLOWED BY ACT. AS MALCOLM THANKS TO S. B. C. BEFORE. THE THESE REASONS I SUPPOSE AB OH TWO. ENCOURAGE COMPLAINING THAT TO SEE IT IS WELL THANK YOU. WE HEAR FROM THE NEXT WITNESS MISTER CHAIR. PLEASE GET IN MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. MY NAME IS TOM REALLY AND I'M CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY MANAGERS PRIOR TO THIS ROLE I HAVE THIRTY YEARS OF HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE AND I CAN ATTEST FIRSTHAND THAT IS BILL WOULD BENEFIT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS AND THEY'RE COMMUNITY MEMBERS GREATLY NOTHING IN EIGHTY FIVE OH TWO. WOULD REMOVE THE HOMEOWNERS RIGHT TO RUN FOR ELECTION NOR WOULD GET ANY DECISION MAKING FOR DISCRETION TO REPORT ON WHETHER TO HOLD AN ELECTION IT IS SOLELY A FUNCTION OF WHETHER THERE ARE ENOUGH HOMEOWNER CANDIDATES IF THE ELECTION IS ALL CONTESTED THE FULL ELECTION WILL AND OCCUR. IF THERE IS AN EQUAL NUMBER OR LESS CANDIDATES IT SIMPLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE CONTRA COSTA THE SECRET BALLOT ELECTIONS WHEN THE RESULTS ALREADY CLEAR I UNDERSTAND THAT OPPOSITION BELIEVES THAT THIS BILL WOULD ENABLE INCUMBENT DIRECTORS TO REMAIN IN OFFICE HOWEVER AB FIVE OH TWO WOULD ACTUALLY ASSIST IN GETTING NEW BOARD MEMBERS SEATED AS OPPOSED TO CONTINUING EXISTING FOR MAKE UP DUE TO THE INABILITY TO HOLD AN ELECTION FOR IN SOME INSTANCES. ALLOWING EXISTING BOARD MEMBERS TO APPOINT TAKEN POSITIONS WHICH IS MORE LIKELY TO LEAD TO THE PROBLEM THAT THE OPPOSITION IS WORRIED ABOUT AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR BY THEN SENATOR MOORLACH WAS APPROVED BY THIS COMMITTEE IN ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR CHANGED CIVIL CODE FIFTY ONE HUNDRED TO ALLOW ELECTION BY ACCLAMATION FOR SIX FOR ASSOCIATIONS. WITH GREATER THAN SIX THOUSAND UNITS AB FIVE OH TO SUPPORTS AND COMPLEMENTS EXISTING LAW MEMBERS IN CLOSING EIGHTY FIVE OH TWO IS A COMMON SENSE SOLUTION HELLO ENABLE ELECTIONS TO OCCUR CAN IS TO BE SEATED CAN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS TO SAVE MONEY I ELECTIONS WERE THE RESULTS WOULD NOT BE CHANGED BY BALLOTING BALL WHILE ENSURING THE NOMINATION PROCESS IS THOROUGH TRANSPARENT AND OPEN. ESPECIALLY NOW IT IS CRITICAL TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO SAVE COSTS RELATED TO HOUSING ENABLING AND CABLE EFFICIENCY IN OPERATIONS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY- EACH YEAR I BILL. THANK YOU NOW LET'S GO TO OPPOSITE WITNESSES WE HAVE TO TEST AND ON THE PHONE TOM SIR FROM CENTRE FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION LAW AND ATTORNEY ERIC SCHIFFER. HELLO YES WE CAN HELLO. AUTHOR OF THE CENTER IS ON A RECORD OF THE BUILDING EIGHTY FIVE OH TWO. OUR PRIMARY WITNESS TODAY IS MATURING SHIPPER AND THE JOURNEY CERTIFIED PUBLIC LAW SPECIALIST AND HE WAS THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL THEN YOU COLLECTED THE GOOD NUMBER OF BRITISH BEACH WALK H. AWAY. AN IMPORTANT APPELLATE CASE THAT UPHELD AND ENFORCED THE RIGHT THE HOMEOWNERS ELECTION PROCEDURES THAT PUT IN THE DEEPEST STERLING ACT. I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME. TO MR ERIC SCHIFFER. THANK YOU MISS CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ERIC SCHIFFER- I AM THE ATTORNEY AT THE LAW FIRM OF SHOULD PRODUCE IN ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA I AM A CERTIFIED APPEL A LOT SPECIALIST AND I WAS. COUNSEL OF RECORD IN THE- WITTENBERG VERSES BEACH WALK HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION DECISION FROM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN MY PRACTICE DOES INVOLVE THE REPRESENTATION OF BOTH HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS AS WELL AS DISSENTING HOMEOWNERS- AND I SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB FIVE OH TWO- BE ISSUE. AS I SEE IT IS THE- PREMISE OF ELECTING DIRECTOR NOMINEES BY ACCLAMATION AS THE MODIFIED- FIFTY ONE HUNDRED G. WOULD SET FORTH- THE STATED GOAL IS TO AVOID ELECTIONS BUT THAT IS ACTUALLY A BIT OF A MISNOMER. THERE IS IN FACT AN ELECTION IT BUT IT'S ONE HELD EXCLUSIVELY BY SEATED BOARD MEMBERS. THAT HISTORICALLY ACCLAMATION IS A VOTE BY CHEERING HER SHOUTING RATHER THAN BY AN ACTUAL BALLOT. SO THE QUESTION FOR THIS- COMMITTEE IS. HOW IMPORTANT IS THE BALLOT TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTION PROCESS. SO I THINK IF WE START WITH THE PREMISE THAT COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENTS ARE IN FACT BECAUSE I GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES IN FACT MANY CASES HAVE SO HELD BECAUSE ACTIONS BY THE H. AWAY BOARDS. CONSTITUTE PRIVATE CONDUCT THAT IMPACTS A BROAD SEGMENT OF SOCIETY AND THEREFORE CONSTITUTES MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST. SO DENYING A BALLOT VOTE ON MATTERS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY IN FACT IN MEMBERS HOMES PRINCES LEGISLATION DIRECTLY IN THE REALM OF VIOLATING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OR ARGUABLY IT AT A MINIMUM QUANTITY CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS LEGISLATION OPENS THE DOORS TO ASSOCIATION BOARDS BE ABLE TO SUMMARILY STRIP OPPONENTS OF VOTING RIGHTS THAT AFFECT WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE EQUALITY. FAIRNESS AND INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTORAL SAYS BYE BYE PASSING A VOTE ALL. IT'S ALSO- ADDING A MECHANISM TO QUELL DISSENTING VIEWS BY FINDING WAYS TO NOT ALLOW NOMINATIONS NOW WITH THE STATED GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION IS COST SAVINGS BUT THAT CAN BECOME SUBTERFUGE FOR ACTUALLY CHILLING THE VOTING PROCESS AND ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF CIVIL CODE FIFTY ONE OH FIVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE- THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS AREA OF THE LAW WAS TO IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE VOTING PROCESS AND THE REASONING WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE FINDINGS MADE AT THE TIME THAT ALEXION'S OF BOARD MEMBERS WORK QUOTA CONTAMINATED BY OPPRESSION MANIPULATION AND INTIMIDATION OF MEMBERS CLOSE QUOTE. I BELIEVE THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION IS A STEP BACKWARDS FROM THAT GOAL UNDER THE AUSPICES OF COST SAVINGS AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW LET'S GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. I'M GONNA ASK THERE'S ANYONE HERE IN THE CHAMBER.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER LUIS RIVAS IS ITEM WHICH I WILL RAISE AND I'M GONNA ASK MY VICE CHAIR TO CHAIR THIS PORTION OF THE MEETING. GREAT THANK YOU. SO I WILL GIVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOOSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET DOWN THERE AND INTRODUCED THE BILL. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I AM PRESENTING AB SEVENTY ONE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN THREE OF US- AND ALSO AS A JOINT AUTHORS THIS BILL AND THE MYSTERY OF THIS- WILL BE TAKING THE TECHNICAL MOMENTS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT REFER REVENUES NOT BE USED FOR THE PURCHASE ORDER ELEMENTS OF LAND ALSO JUST MENTION THAT THE CEMENT THIS BILL WAS AMENDED IN REDDING TAX COMMITTEE- TO REMOVE THE CORPORATE TAX AND MAKE OTHER TECHNICAL MINUTES. AB SEVENTY ONE WHAT ESTABLISH THE BRING CALIFORNIA HOME ACT AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS BILLS THAT WOULD ESTABLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME AN ONGOING SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS OF HOMELESSNESS THIS IS A BILL THAT COULD GENERATE UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BY CONFORMING STATE TAX LAW TO FEDERAL LAW. IN ADDITION THIS MEASURE HOLD GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE AND CORPORATE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR IS UTILIZED EFFECTIVELY THIS IS A COMMITTEE THAT WELL KNOWS THE MORAL AN UNPRECEDENTED HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED BY COVERED NINETEEN AND DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD ONE IN FOUR AMERICANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS RESIDE IN OUR STATE. THAT MEANS OVER A HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS ARE ON HOUSED EVERY GIVEN NIGHT WITH HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS DUE TO THIS PANDEMIC WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR APPROACH WE NEED TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS A FIGHTING CHANCE TO BE HOUSED. THE ONGOING INVESTMENTS PROPOSED BY THIS BILL COULD MEAN THAT TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE A YEAR ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE AND FAMILIES COULD ACCESS SAY SHELTER FORTY THREE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS COULD MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING. OVER FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE COULD RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SERVICES SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT SUPPORT WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS BILL BEING SIGNED INTO LAW THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE HAS REPEATEDLY SHOWN THE CALIFORNIANS RESOUNDINGLY IDENTIFY HOMELESSNESS AS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES OF THE STATE. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE AN URBAN OR RURAL MEMBER- IF YOU ARE INLAND OR ON THE COAST NORTH OR SOUTH. WE KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS IS THE TOP ISSUE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS. AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES I WANTED JUST NOTE- THAT TO CANCER AND TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THAT FOLKS MAY HAVE ABOUT THE MECHANISM OF THIS BILL. WE ALSO HAVE ARTHUR MANDEL FROM THE MAYOR- THAT THE L. A. MAYOR GARCETTI'S OFICE AS WELL AS CHRIS MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA. BUT AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR MAIN WITNESSES. FROM THE UNITED WAY OF ORANGE COUNTY MICHELLE MURPHY AND STEPHANIE ASHLEY FROM BRILLIANT CORNERS. I THANK YOU MR TO DO WE HAVE THE- WITNESSES ON THE PHONE MODERATOR. YES BOTH ARE ON THE LINE ALL RIGHT LET'S GO AHEAD AND HEAR FROM THEM. OKAY WHEN WE HAVE MADE ALONG HERE ME. YES MISS MISS MURPHY. THE RAM OKAY MICHELLE MY- GOSH GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS MISS SUMMER FAMILY DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS WITH ORANGE COUNTY UNITED WAY I'M HONORED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO SPEAK OF ONE OF THE OVER. THREE HUNDRED NONPROFIT LEADERS ELECTED IF. AND ADVOCATE IN THE BROUGH HELD HOME COALITION SUPPORTING AB SEVENTY ONE. I KNOW BOTH IN MY CAPACITY AS A LEADER IN A LARGE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENT BUT OUR CURRENT APPROACH TO COMBATING HOMELESSNESS IS NOT WORKING. NINE STATE AGENCIES ADMINISTER AND OVERSEE FORTY ONE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FUNDING TO MITIGATE MUCH. OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECENTLY PUT IT I LONG TERM STRATEGY RATHER THAN A PIECEMEAL STATUS QUO WOULD MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT OUR INVESTMENTS WOULD GO FURTHER AND HAVE A MORE MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AB SEVENTY ONE IS A STATE WIDE STRATEGIC PLAN WE NEED INCLUDING BOTH THE STATE WHAT APPROACH AN ONGOING FUNDING AT THE CBO LEADER WORKING WITH MULTIPLE HOMELESS SERVICE PROVIDERS I KNOW HOW CRITICAL BOTH ARE. THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT APPROACH HAS BEEN VERY INEFFECTIVE FOR NONPROFIT IMPACTING BOTH PARTICIPATION AND EFFICACY. PIECEMEAL APPROACHES LED. TO UNDERWHELMING FUNDING OVERALL. ON THE FUNDING GIVES YOU OF THEY NEED TO BE AFFECT RATHER THAN UP PLUG EVER YEAR IMAGE BY TO NEW PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE STATEWIDE APPROACH CAN PHYSICAL ACCOUNTABILITY AS IT STANDS THERE IS LITTLE ACCOUNTABILITY AND HELP CALIFORNIANS IN COMBATING FROM HOMELESSNESS SHE WAS SUCH A DISJOINTED APPROACH HOW COULD THERE BE. AB SEVENTY ONE ENSURES THE GOVERNMENT COULD CONDUCT NEEDS AND GAP ANALYSIS IDENTIFY EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT COULD BE TAPPED TO ADDRESS NEEDS AND CALCULATE RESOURCE GAPS. NEXT IT INSURES THE GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE GOALS TO WHICH THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND IF JURISDICTIONS DO NOT MEET THEIR STATED GOAL WHEN AN ADDICT IS TAKEN THEY WILL NOT RECEIVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF FUNDING. TRANSPARENTLY TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS IN AB SEVENTY ONE ENSURE THAT RESOURCES ARE TARGETED AT THE COMMUNITIES WHO NEED THE MOST. BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THIS BILL COMES AT NO COST TO INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THE PUBLIC DESERVES TO KNOW HOW PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. THIS BILL WILL EXPAND RESOURCES FOR CBO LIKE MINE AND PAIR THEM WITH A BOLD RESTRUCTURING OF THE SYSTEM CALIFORNIA HAS IN PLACE. TO ALLOCATE FUNDING AND OVERSEE PERFORMANCE. IN THIS MOMENT AS WE KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE FROM CARBON NINETEEN AND ENVISION A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR STATE WE NEED TO ACT BOLDLY AB SEVENTY ONE MEET THE SCALE OF THE CRISIS AND IT IS WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS MURPHY AND THE SECOND ONE IS WE HAVE A STEPHANIE ASHLEY. NONALIGNED STEPHANIE. YES I AM THANK YALE GOING AHEAD NOW THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS STEPHANIE ACTUALLY AND THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HOUSING SERVICES DIRECTOR FROM BRILLIANT CORNERS. WHICH IS A PART OF HOUSING PROVIDER THAT OPERATES EIGHT WIDE. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL TO A FAMILY MEMBER RIVAS OFFERING EXACTLY THE TYPE OF BOLD SOLUTION NEEDED TO MEET THE SCALE AND THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN AB SEVENTY ONE. BRING CALIFORNIA HOME ACTIONS. FOR TO LONG CALIFORNIA HAS TRIED TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS WITH PEACE NOW PROGRAMS AND IT COMPLAIN NOT WORKING. WHAT MAKES AB SEVENTY ONE DIFFERENT IS THAT IT'S A PERMANENT ONGOING SOLUTION. HELLO THE BACK ON THE GROUND THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IT ALLOWS US TO RECRUIT LANDLORDS TO TAKE HOUSING COMPANIES AND PROVIDE ONGOING SERVICES THAT MANY OF. OUR CLIENTS NEED TO REMAIN HOW. WE'VE SEEN ON THE FUND WENT. TO MEET THEM. HAS RESULT- IT'S EXACTLY THE MODEL BUNCH A DECREASE OF ALMOST 40% IN VETERAN THOMAS. THIS IS THE WAY WE CAN BEGIN TO REVERSE THE CYCLE THOMAS. AB FIVE ONE INCOME. AND SIMULTANE THE INFLOW OF CALIFORNIANS INTO HOMELESSNESS. AND INCREASES ACCESS TO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THE PROVEN SOLUTION TO ENDING THE CYCLE. I BRING CORNERS WE GET TO AND HOMELESSNESS EVERY DAY. DONALD A PARTICIPANT IN OUR SEPARATE THE COMFORTABLE HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL RECENTLY SHARED THAT. SOMETIMES YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO WAKE UP FROM THIS. DREAM BECAUSE IT'S TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. THE DREAM HE ABOUT IT SINCE THE FEELING OF HAVING HIS OWN APARTMENT AFTER MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF HOUSING INSTABILITY. WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB SEVENTY ONE WE CAN MAKE THAT DREAM A REALITY FOR A QUARTER OF THE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF FUNDING ALONE. AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM OF PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE CAN REDIRECT OUR FOCUS FROM SCRAMBLING THROUGH FUNDING BILLS AND BASS EVERY YEAR. TO DOING WHAT WE DO BEST WHICH IS ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND EVERY CALIFORNIANS HAVE A HOME THANK YOU. ACTUALLY AND WE WILL OFFER. WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. AND ALL THAT YEAH OUR- OF. SORRY ABOUT THAT I THINK YOU MISS ASHLEY FOR YOUR- YOUR- TESTIMONY NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES TESTIFYING BY PHONE THAT REAGAN AND DANTE ACOSTA VOTER. MATT REAGAN ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YEAH THANK YOU I'M HERE ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MATT REGAN FROM THE BAY AREA COUNCIL- I WORK FOR AN ORGANIZATION THAT NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OPPOSED TO TAXES WE HAVE SUPPORTED MANY TAXES IN THE PAST- PARTICULARLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BE SUPPORTED. GOVERNOR BRYANT INCOME TAX INCREASE IN TWENTY TWELVE- THE FIRST BUSINESS GROUP IN CALIFORNIA TO DO SO WE'RE NOT IDEOLOGICALLY OPPOSED TO TAXES BUT WE ARE TO THE SELECT- WE DEFINITELY NEED SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS- MORE HOMES WOULD BE A GREAT START WE KNOW THAT- RECENT DATA FROM. THE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION SHOWS THAT YEAR OVER YEAR PERMITS ARE DYING FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BY 24% FOR DYING FOR MULTI FAMILY HOMES BY ALREADY HISTORICALLY LOW NUMBER. SO THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IS MORE. HOMES NOT NECESSARILY MORE MONEY- HOME PROGRAMS NEED BE FUND BUT THEY NEED TO BE OVER HALL. EIGHT COULD HARDLY ON- STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT ON HOMELESSNESS AND I'LL BE THE QUICK QUOTE FROM THE COVER LETTER FROM NOT REPORT- WITH MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. CALIFORNIANS WHO EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE HAS THE LARGEST HOMELESS POPULATION IN THE NATION. BUT IT'S APPROACH TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. IS DISJOINTED AT LEAST NINE STATE AGENCIES ADMINISTER AND OVERSEE FORTY ONE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE FUNDING TO MITIGATE HOMELESSNESS. YET NO SINGLE ENTITY OVERSEES THE STATE'S EFFORTS ARE AS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING A STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLAN. ALTHOUGH THE HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL WAS CREATED AND PARKS TO COORDINATE EXISTING FUNDING. AND ESTABLISH PARTNERSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO END HOMELESSNESS IT HAS NOT DONE SO. AS A RESULT THE STATE CONTINUES TO LACK A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS SPENDING TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO A DESTROYING TO PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW CURRENTLY DOESN'T WORK WE NEED TO PUT THE REFORMS IN PLACE. AND THEN EXPLORE AVENUES CRITICS NOT FUNDING. JUST LAST WEEK THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DELIBERATED A PROGRAM FOR SLATE STATE SLEEPING SITE. CAN'T CAMPS IN PARKING LOT. THAT THE STATE COMPTROLLER ESTIMATED WOULD COST SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER TENT THAT'S THE MORTGAGE ON A MILLION DOLLAR HOME. L. A. ALREADY HAS SUCH A PROGRAM IN PLACE. IT COSTS TWO THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PERSON PER PER MONTH. ASSUMING TWO PEOPLE PER MILLION DOLLAR HOMES THAT IS ALSO THE MORTGAGE ON A MILLION DOLLAR HOME. SO WE CAN'T KEEP FUNDING PROGRAMS LIKE THIS- UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO USE THESE DOLLARS AND GET THE BEST FROM PA BANG FOR OUR BUCK. THE REFORMS MUST COME FIRST AND THEN THE FUNDING WE RESPECTIVELY ASKED FOR A NO VOTE. ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER REAGAN. DAN CLAWSON AND OR ARE YOU ON THE- YES I AM YOU MAY PROCEEDS. PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS AT TWO MINUTES. THAT MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS AND HOW TO BETTER ON THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR TAX POLICY AT THE SILICON VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP. I SPEAK TODAY IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTY ONE. AB SEVENTY ONE INCREASES TAXES ON TWO TYPES OF INCOME. GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME KNOWN AS GUILTY AND REPATRIATION INCOME EARNED BY WATER SUCH TAXPAYERS. LTM REPATRIATION INCOME WERE PART OF A FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IS ASSERTED THAT TAXING GUILTY IN REPATRIATION INCOME WOULD MERELY CONFORM TO FEDERAL LAW. THAT IS SEARCHING IS. BECAUSE THE GUILTY AND REPATRIATION PROVISIONS WERE PART OF A BROAD INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORM THOSE REFORMS INCLUDED A MAJOR REDUCTION IN THE U. S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CHERRY PICK REVENUE RAISERS LIKE GUILTY AND REPATRIATION INCOME WITHOUT ALSO REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE SHOWS THE CONFORMITY IS NOT WHAT AB SEVENTY ONE IS ABOUT. REPATRIATION INCREASE FEDERAL TAXABLE INCOME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TAXING THIS INCOME NOW WOULD INVOLVE AND UNPRECEDENTED RETROACTIVE TAX. AB SEVENTY ONE WILL TAX GUILTY IN REPATRIATION INCOME ONLY FOR WATER'S EDGE TAXPAYERS THE WATER'S EDGE ELECTION IS REFERRED TO AS A LOOPHOLE WHICH IT CERTAINLY IS NOT THE WATER'S EDGE ALEXIAD BECAME UP ON THE METAL PROVISION OF CALIFORNIA TAX LAW TO TERMINATE AN INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTE TRIGGERED BY CALIFORNIANS WORLDWIDE UNITARY TAX SYSTEM. AB SEVENTY WHAT WOULD ONCE AGAIN EMBROILED THE UNITED STATES IN THE ST INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES THAT PROMPTED PASSAGE OF THE WATER'S EDGE ROLLS IN THE FIRST PLACE. FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD ENCOURAGE ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA PLODDING TURGID PLAYERS LEAD CALIFORNIA BY INCREASING TAXES ON OUR JOB CREATORS. THANK YOU PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB SEVENTY ONE.

AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE PLEASE ONTINUE GREAT NOW SO THAT'LL BRING US BACK AND WE WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER WARD YOU HAVE A COMMENT. GREAT I WANNA THANK THE AUTHOR AND THE CHAIR FORCE ARE PRESENTING ON BEHALF OF THE ALL FOR THIS I KNOW THIS IS IT AND TEN INTENSIVE BILL THAT SHE HAS PUT A LOT OF EFFORT INTO IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY ADDRESS A LOT OF OUR HOMELESSNESS SOLUTIONS COMPREHENSIVELY- AS A NEW MEMBER I WAS A FORMER CHAIR OF OUR C. OR C. IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND OF COURSE OF THE COUNCILMEMBER REPRESENTING SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS THIS ISSUE STRIKES ME VERY- PERSONALLY THAT I'VE INVESTED A LOT AND WE HAVE TO DO A LOT BETTER FOR STATE. WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO NEED A LOT OF ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND WE KNOW WE NEED THOSE RESOURCES TO BE ON GOING ON THIS IS GOING TO BE A MULTI YOUR PROBLEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO WITH THIS BUDGETS- CYCLE COMING UP WE'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BUT THAT'S ONE TIME FUNDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A ON GOING REVENUE STREAM I THINK IT'S CRITICAL- AND IT NEEDS TO BE HEALTHY WE HAVE A BIG PROBLEM FACING A STATEWIDE- AND IT'S GOING TO DEMAND. THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PLAN FOR AND EXECUTE APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS FOR HOMELESSNESS ON THIS THE- IN THE SENATE VERY COMPREHENSIVE BILL THAT BOTH- ADDRESSES THAT FUNDING IT'S IMPORTANT WHERE YOU GOING TO PAY FOR IT BUT ALSO MAKE SURE ON THAT WE ARE PROVING UPON OUR ARE. WHERE THE FUNDING IS DIRECTED- AND HOW WE ARE HOLDING ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR TO THE TAXPAYERS AND HOW WE ARE MOST IMPORTANTLY DIRECTING IT TOWARDS EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS- I SEE IT'S GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS HERE- AND ALL OF A PLACE MAKE A COMMENT RATHER THAN BEING REALLY SEEK OUT ANY ANY FEEDBACK- KNOWING THAT THE AUTHOR AND HER TEAM ARE LISTENING CLOSELY AS THIS IS GOING FOR AND HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL- AS WELL. MISTER BANKS HERE- FIRST OF ALL ON THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE HOMES CORNING FINANCING COUNCIL I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHER SPECIFIC DIRECTION TO UTILIZE MANY OF THE DIRECTORS OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES I THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE UPON THE MEMBERSHIP OF THEIR ANYONE BE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ALLOW. FOR REPRESENTATIVES TO SOMETIMES DIRECTORS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE. ON ACS. ALSO IS SUSPECT. ON THIS BILL. ALL RIGHT TO. THE ALLOCATED IN A CERTAIN WAY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE- I THINK FURTHER SPECIFICATION TO ENSHRINE AND ENSURE. THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING- IS REALLY DEDICATED TOWARDS HOUSING. OR SOMETIMES IT'S HARD REFERS TO AS POSITIVE EXITS- SOMETIMES I THINK SOME BEER THAT- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT MAY NOT HAPPEN TO ME NOT HAVING ACT TOGETHER- ARE USING THIS MONEY WITH. ALL GOOD INTENT- BUT DOESN'T ACTUALLY PRODUCE MANY THE OUTCOMES THAT WE EXPECT WE KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE INVESTMENTS AND HOUSING SOLUTIONS- SO THAT NOBODY AN IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT- AND ALSO WRITTEN NOTE AS WELL THAT. I THINK THE BASELINE START TO RE USING FOR. A GOOD- A GOOD BASED WEIGHT OF THIS IS ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT- I WOULD CLAUSSEN. CONTINUING TO USE THAT FOR TWO REASONS ONE- I THOUGHT THE ONLY METRIC OF HOW WE MEASURE THE HOMELESS POPULATION THERE SO THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS. TO REALLY IDENTIFY THE SCOPE IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN A GIVEN REGION. AND THAT NUMBER WILL CHANGE OVER TIME HOPEFULLY IT WILL CHANGE. IN THE NEGATIVE HOPEFULLY THAT NUMBER WILL GO DOWN. AND I KNOW WE'VE SEEN THIS IN PREVIOUS BUDGET YEARS WHERE WE'VE USED THE POINT IN TIME COUNT AS- A SINGULAR METRIC TO BE ABLE DECIDE WHO GETS WHAT. BUT IF THE AREA IS GOD'S ACT TOGETHER IF AN AREA IS IMPROVING. YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE A REDUCTION IN HOMELESSNESS AND WE SHOULD NOT PENALIZE. OUT REGIONS THAT HAVE THEIR ACT TOGETHER AND THAT ARE ACTUALLY DOING THINGS RIGHT. WE SHOULD REWARD THOSE SAID LET'S JUST BE- I CONTINUE TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW WE ARE- SORT OF BROAD BRUSHING. AND THE- DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS- NEXT ON PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES THESE ARE CRITICAL IN THIS IS ACTUALLY A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DEFINING THOSE. AND WE ARE HOLDING OUR RECIPIENTS ACCOUNTABLE THOREZ- I REALLY LIKE WITH THIS BILL HAS AS IT. IS A GOOD STARTING POINT. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE TO END HOMELESSNESS. IN THE UNITED STATES IN REGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF DAVID INTERMENT STUDIES ABOUT WHAT WE- BE MET- AND I THINK IT'S SHOULD BE REFER. IN POLICIES. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A STRONG REQUIREMENT- TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES AND COCS ARE APPLYING FOR FUNDING JOINTLY. COORDINATION IN A REGION IS EVERYTHING TOWARDS A SUCCESS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE. AND HOMELESSNESS- I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS A PROVISION IN THIS BILL THAT'S GOING TO BE- DIRECTING- DIETZ C. D. H. C. S. TO WORK ON FEDERAL PROVE FROM MEDICAL BENEFITS I THINK IT'S MONEY WE'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE- THAT WE CAN BRING HERE TO CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN THIS JUST ADDS I THINK THAT THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF WHY THIS BILL SO IMPORTANT AND SO- SO. IMPORTANT THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASS AND THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGN. LASTLY ALL MENTION OF COURSE HOW WE PAY FOR IT- I. I THINK THAT THIS IS- IMPORTANT IN THE SCOPE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT. SOMETHING IN THE TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE I THINK THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION- I WOULD CAUTION THE AUTHORED ABOUT USING SOMETHING THAT IS SO. SINGULARLY FOCUSED I THINK BECAUSE OF THE- NATURE OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING STATEWIDE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT- BROAD BASED SOLUTIONS. AND IF WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT ONE PARTICULAR AREA. WHETHER IT'S NOT IN THIS CASE EIGHT TAX PROVISION THAT. IS GOING TO IF I JUST CONVERSATION GOES FORWARD GOING TO INVITE- INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION- CHALLENGES I THINK WITH A LOT OF OUR MANY IMPORTANT INDUSTRIES RIGHT NOW ABOUT. POTENTIALLY PLACING COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGES- FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORK WE'RE WE'RE THE WAY THESE INDUSTRIES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK BROAD BI SOLUTIONS ARE THE WAY TO GO SO I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD IS. UP TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO LOOK FOR. ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN A WAY TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD AGAIN NOT SHRINKING AS PIE BECAUSE WE NEED BIG SOLUTIONS- BUT MAKE SURE THAT IT'S BEING DRIVEN IN A WAY- THAT IS NOT BROAD BASED AND- IMPACT- SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY. TO MOVE THE BILL AND IT WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY. RIGHT TO HAVE A MOTION BY. MISTER WARD- MISSED QUICK SILVA. TO MISTER SO OFTEN DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT. I'M SORRY AND IT THAT WAS A MR KALRA THE SECOND. ONE GO AHEAD MA'AM. WELL I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING A- MAJOR BILL FORWARD. SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW THAT I SPEND MANY HOURS NOT JUST TODAY BUT- THROUGHOUT THE WEEK SINCE I'VE BEEN IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT THINKING ABOUT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. I'VE BEEN AFFECTED PERSONALLY REGARDING HOMELESSNESS. AND THIS BILL COVERS MANY MANY OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS COMMITTEE. AS SOME OF YOU MIGHT KNOW WE HAVE TWENTY SIX BILLS TODAY REGARDING HOMELESSNESS OR AND HOUSING- AND WE'VE HAD MANY BEFORE THIS AND WILL HAVE MANY AFTER THIS BILL ONE DEAL CANNOT FIX WHAT IS BROKEN- FOCUSING ON A REVENUE. A STEADY SUSTAINABLE REVENUE IS CERTAINLY IMPORTANT. WE'RE IN A TIME WHERE WE HAVE REVENUES COMING INTO THE STATE THAT WE DID NOT COUNT ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ACTUALLY IN SURPLUS WE COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM TODAY IF WE HAD THE WILL ANOTHER WILL IS TO LOOK AT OUR BUDGET AND SAY HOW MANY THINGS CAN WE CUT. HOW MANY THINGS CAN WE CROSS OUT HOW MANY THINGS CAN WE STREAMLINE. BEFORE WE GO BACK TO THE TAXPAYERS. AND ASK THEM TO PAY MORE TAXES IN THIS CASE IT'S NOT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS. IT'S ACTUALLY. CORPORATE TAX PAYERS. AND I'VE SAID MANY TIMES IN ORDER FOR US TO HAVE GOOD JOBS WE HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYERS WE NEED EMPLOYERS AND THE EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT MIDDLE CLASS OPPORTUNITIES BUT WHEN WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS ONE. ONE PART OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO. FUND ANOTHER PART WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN IS A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE LEAVING OUR STATE THE CENSUS JUST RECENTLY CAME OUT YESTERDAY SAYING THAT. LOS ANGELES FOR THE FIRST TIME HAS NOT GROWN. BUT THIS IS NOT THE BURDEN OF BLAME MEAN WE HAVE VERY LOW HOUSING PRODUCTION WE KNOW LAST YEAR WE HAD MANY MANY HOUSING BILLS THAT WENT. NOT ONLY TO APPROPRIATIONS BUT EVEN TO THE GOVERNOR THAT WERE NOT SIGNED SO WE HAVE A PRODUCTION ISSUE. WE HAVE A SHORTAGE OF HOUSING WE HAVE MANY ISSUES IN THIS BILL IS A BILL THAT I THINK AS A BODY WE NEED TO MAKE A PRIORITY AND REALLY MAP IT OUT BEFORE I CAN SUPPORT IT. THIS DOES NOT DISMISS THE AUTHORS GOOD WORK I HAVE A HIGH REGARD FOR HER YES MATTER FACT TO MORE BILLS COMING RIGHT AFTER THIS THAT I'M GOING TO BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT. US AND IN NO WAY DOES IT DIMINISH THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO STUDY FUNDING STREAM BUT AGAIN WHERE DOES THAT MONEY COME FROM. AND HOW CAN WE LOOK IN. THE BUDGET WE CURRENTLY HAVE WITHOUT LOOKING OUTSIDE TO TAX MORE SO TODAY I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THIS ISSUE. ON A DAILY BASIS. THANK YOU MISS CLARK SILVA- ANYBODY ELSE WISH TO COMMENT MISTER KILEY. I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED THIS IN THE TESTIMONY FROM EITHER THE PRESENTER OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BUT WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE CITED TO A LINKING INSUFFICIENT FUNDING WITH CALIFORNIA'S. HOMELESSNESS SITUATION. I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND AS DEMAND OR STAY THE COURSE YEAH WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE CITED THAT. LINKING A LACK OF FUNDING- WITH THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A- YOU KNOW A PRETTY SIZEABLE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM. I THINK THAT IF YOU TALK TO ANY. INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS WITH OUR HOMELESS COMMUNITY THEY WILL TELL YOU THE LACK OF RESOURCES IS WHAT HAS EXACERBATED THE SITUATION ON OUR STREETS AGAIN I'M TRYING TO ANSWER TRINITRON UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT YOU KNOW STATES THAT SPEND MORE ON HOMELESSNESS- THEN THAT OFFICER DOING BETTER THAT SEEKS TO DOING BETTER DOING SO BECAUSE THEY'RE SPENDING MORE HOMELESSNESS I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE. WHERE PROPOSAL MONEY IS A SOLUTION OR SEE IF THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S THE PROBLEM ISOMER ST YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK PART OF THE ANSWER IS IN RECENT YEARS PARTICULARLY AFTER THE LAST FOUR YEARS WE HAVE. SEEN MASSIVE CUTS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS OF STATES HAVE HAD TO PICK UP THE SLACK AND THE REALITY IS AND SO MANY OF OUR JURISDICTIONS- WE- LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE STRIVING MIGHTILY. TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS- BUT FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES. EVERY DAY. THEY'RE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP HOUSE A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE INDIVIDUALS. AND EVERY DAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. INDIVIDUALS BECOME HOMELESS. IN OAKLAND THAT STATISTIC FOR EVERY ONE PERSON THAT GETS HOUSED. ANOTHER TO BECOME HOMELESS. IN MY CITY FOR EVERY PERSON'S HOUSE. ANOTHER THREE BECOME HOMELESS SO. I KNOW THAT THERE CERTAINLY PERSPECTIVE THAT WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH THE MONEY THAT WE'RE SPENDING I AGREE WE'VE GOT TO HAVE. REAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND I THIS MEASURE. ON HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND IT IF YOU. ARE ABLE TO. TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT OF THAT'S OF HELP- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS WE- HAVE JUST HAVE NOT HAD ENOUGH RESOURCES. AND JUST IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SPEND SOME ONE TIME DOLLARS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT'S ONGOING AND I DO THINK- TO RESPOND TO OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY. WE OUGHT TO USE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS YEAR'S- FEDERAL STIMULUS MONEY TOWARD HOMELESSNESS BUT I THINK ALSO A LONG TERM. SOLUTION AND ONGOING REVENUE STREAMS SOMETHING WE NEED AS WELL. THANK YOU. OUR ANYBODY ELSE MISSED CALL RHONDA JERRY COMMENTS OKAY THEN I'LL CLOSE WITH THE COMMENT PERIOD HERE- I SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS THAT MR SILVER AND MR WARD HAS AT HAVE EXPRESSED WHICH IS WHEN YOU DECIDE TO PUT ALL YOUR FINANCIAL EGGS IN ONE BASKET TO FUND SOMETHING- THAT BASKET HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SHIFT AND- WE GIVE AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO NOT DO THE BUSINESS THAT THEY WERE DOING HERE- BYE BYE BY PUSHING HIM OUT WHICH TAKES OUT JOBS IT CETERA. WHILE THE CONTENTS OF THIS BILL ARE I HAVE NO ISSUES WITH IT'S THE FUNDING OF THE BILL THAT I HAVE ISSUES WITH AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO IF THIS IS THE PRIORITY OF THE STATE AND WE HAVE A PLAN THAT SAYS WHERE THOSE DOLLARS HOW THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE SPENT AND IF IT'S- GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE OR NOT. WHICH IS HAS SOME ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT- THEN WITHOUT YOU KNOW ABSENT THAT- IT'S HARD TO SUPPORT SO AT THAT- I WILL GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLOSE. SO LET ME FIRST JUST APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S CONSIDERATION I DO KNOW- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS ND LET ME JUST SAY FEW THINGS TO. ADDRESS WHAT I THINK OF BEEN SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ON THIS SO THIS BILL WE'RE PROPOSING A CALIFORNIA SIMPLY CONFORMS WITH FEDERAL TAX LAW- THIS GUILTY TAX WOULD OFFSET THE IMPACT OF. RECENT TAX CUTS BY THE LAST ADMINISTRATION WHICH IT OFFERED INCENTIVES FOR MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS TO SHIFT PROFITS OVERSEAS AND THEY'RE OPEN TWENTY FOUR OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ALREADY CONFORMED AND I'LL JUST MENTION SOME OF THOSE STATES. ALABAMA ARIZONA NORTH DAKOTA IDAHO WEST VIRGINIA AND OTHER STATES THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE CONSIDERED RED STATES MORE CNSERVATIVE STATES- AND I WILL ALSO MENTION. THAT PART OF. A PART OF THIS CORPORATE TAX PART OF THIS TAX STRUCTURE- IT WOULDN'T CREATE ANY COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR STATE BECAUSE CORPORATIONS WOULD HAVE TO PAY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED SO THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS DRIVING CORPORATIONS OUT OF STATE IF THEY IF THEY GO. THEY'RE GOING TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME IMPACT- I DO YOU KNOW APPRECIATE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER MORE BROAD BASED TAX I WILL SAY- THERE WAS ANOTHER COMPONENT WHEN AB SEVENTY ONE WAS FIRST PROPOSED. THAT WAS A MORE BROADLY BASED TAX- IT WAS BROAD AND BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT IT BROUGHT UP OPPOSITION I AND THAT PIECE GOT STRIPPED OUT IN THE RENDON TAX COMMITTEE SO. I THINK THERE IS A PERSPECTIVE- THAT AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LARGEST MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS- THAT HAVE ENGAGED AND REALLY FRANKLY A TAX AVOIDANCE STRATEGY AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS JUST RECOUP OUR FAIR SHARE AS A STATE- I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND I KNOW. THERE WAS SET AT LEAST ON THE OPPOSITION AND SOMEHOW THE SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE AS FAR AS PLANNING AROUND HOMELESSNESS THERE'S ANOTHER BILL THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE VOTING ON WHICH IS MY ABILITY TO SIXTEEN. WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESTABLISH EXACTLY THAT PLAN AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO. ALL THESE THINGS AT THE SAME TIME WOULD NEED TO BE LANDING WE NEED A- AND WE NEED. A A ONGOING SOURCE REVENUES IN OF THIS FORD SO WITH THAT. A VERY HOPE VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD. WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION- REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS YEAR'S BUDGET THERE IS GOING TO BE TREMENDOUS ONGOING NEED. AND WE ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY BOTH BEFORE COVERED AND AFTER COVERED THIS IS A MORAL CRISIS TODAY AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. HI MR GABRIEL YOU CAME IN LATE- DID YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS. RECORD YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR VICE CHAIR AND- APOLOGIES IT'S COMPLICATED WITH OUR HEARING SCHEDULED. AT THE SAME TIME- WELL JUST BE BRIEF I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I AGREE VERY STRONGLY. THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST MORE ON PUBLIC POLICY CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT VEHICLE TO MOVE BACK CONVERSATIONS FORWARD- I DO AGREE WITH- WITH OUR CHAIR ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY NEED FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THIS- I THINK THAT'S A THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CENTRAL THEIR NUMBER GOOD PROPOSALS MOVING THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE. AROUND THAT. WHAT WHAT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IN ADDITION TO RESOURCES I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT STRATEGY- AND HOW WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE ISSUES- I. IN MY COMMUNITY THERE'S JUST SUCH EXTRAORDINARY FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE LACK OF PROGRESS ON THIS ISSUE- AND WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY THEY WILL SAY TO ME I HAVE VOTED TWICE TO TAX MYSELF. IN LOS ANGELES I VOTED FOR MEASURE H. AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. VOTER HHH AT THE CITY LEVEL. AND EVERY TIME I LOOK OUTSIDE MY WINDOW IT SEEMS LIKE THE PROBLEM IS GETTING WORSE IT IS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON. IN OUR COMMUNITY AND SO. I'M LOOKING FORWARD IN IT IN ADDITION TO IN ADDITION TO THESE RESOURCES TO HAVING SOME REALLY- REALLY ROBUST CONVERSATIONS AROUND CHARGING AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME SOME. SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR FRIENDS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT- ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING I REALLY- BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT WE NEED THESE OF THOSE COUNTY BUILDING MEASURE SO WE CAN DO DATA DRIVEN POLICY MAKING. SORT OF A SENSE OF WHAT INTERVENTIONS ARE WORKING AND WHICH ARE NOT- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY. I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR TO THIS COMMITTEE- CONTINUING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE THOUGH THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE ARE DEMANDING OF US AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WARD WE HAVE A SECOND. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. SO. MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU COULD CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS TO PAY. AS A MAN. TO THE- COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS TO. CHIU I'D SAY ARE DON'T KNOW. YOU DON'T KNOW. GABRIELLE GABRIEL I KALRA. KALRA AYE. KILEY NO. KILEY KNOW. WARD WART I. WORK SILVA. WEEKS WICKS I. WANT TO CITY. FOUR FIVE TWO TWO ZERO THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES- THE MEASURE PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU COLLEAGUES. LET'S GO TO MISTER BLOOM HAS BEEN VERY PATIENTLY WAITING WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY FOURTEEN TWELFTH MISTER BOND. WELL. GO ON- AB WORKING TRYING TO. THIS IS ABOUT REMOVING BARRIERS TO MULTI FAMILY. THEY OR CALIFORNIA. BURKE. RIGHT PLACE. EXISTING REFER REMAIN LARGELY AND ACCESSIBLE TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR IT'S ALSO CRUCIAL TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS BY ENSURING THAT LOW WAGE WORKERS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE CLOSE TO WHERE THEY WORKS IS SOMETHING WE TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME AND IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE STATE'S HOUSING NEEDS REVERSING ENTRENCHED PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION AND EXCLUSION AND REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE WE NEED TO INCREASE DENSITY AND EXPAND INFILL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. PARTICULARLY MIXED INCOME AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE PROTECT AND INVEST IN SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT WHETHER THE THREAT IS FROM SKYROCKETING RENTS OR FROM DISINVESTMENT. DISPLACEMENT OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WORSENS CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS AND ALSO FRUSTRATES EFFORTS TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE BY DRIVING LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS TO AREAS WITH LESS TRANSIT ACCESS AND LONGER COMMUTES. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC CHRONIC DISINVESTMENT INSENSITIVE COMMUNITIES AND PROTECT AGAINST DISPLACEMENT. AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT TO DEVELOP MAPS OF BOTH HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS AND SENSITIVE COMMUNITIES IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND ACADEMIC EXPERTS. THESE DATA BASED MAPS WILL AID IN STATE AND LOCAL DECISION MAKING AROUND LAND USE POLICIES AND PUBLIC INVESTMENTS AND WILL HELP ENSURE THAT BOTH THE STATE. AND CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE CRITICAL INFORMATION. TO ASSIST IN MEETING THEIR LEGAL OBLIGATION TO AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHER FAIR HOUSING. THE FACT IS WE NEED TO BUILD A LOT MORE HOUSING AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERY JURISDICTION IS DOING ITS FAIR SHARE TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF HOUSING TYPES AT A RANGE OF INCOME LEVELS.

ONE FIFTY FIVE TO ONE YOUR BILL IS OUT WE WILL ALLOW OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU JERRY FLIGHT HOME- WITHOUT I SEE MR GRAYSON'S HERE TO FINISH UP HIS FINAL TWO BILLS FILE ITEM ELEVEN AB. SIX OH TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT THE ASSEMBLY BILL SIX ZERO TWO. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AB SECURE TO ESTABLISH IS IMPORTANT NEW STANDARDS FOR THE NEXUS STUDIES THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PREPARE WHEN IMPOSING DEVELOPMENT FEES OR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES. HIS MOVE MOTION REQUIREMENTS THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS FAVOR EXISTING LEVELS OF SERVICE CAPITAL OR PROVIDE A CAPITAL FACILITIES PLAN FOR PROPOSED EXPENDITURES. AND COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC NOTICE AND OPEN MEETING REQUIREMENTS. HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT SOME OF THE RESEARCH BEHIND THIS BILL IS DAVID GARCIA POLICY DIRECTOR OF UC BERKELEY'S TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING INNOVATION WITH THE MOTION SECOND HIS. COMMENTS WILL BE BRIEF. LET'S GO TO. THE LINE FOR HIS CHRISTMAS TESTIMONY MR GRAYSON'S WITNESS. OPERATOR. OPERATOR IF WE COULD RECOGNIZE MISTER GARCIA FROM THE TURNER CENTER OR- POTENTIALLY LUIS MORA TODAY FROM CALIFORNIA BE. I DO NOT SHOW THAT- MR GARCIA HAS DIALED IN. I THINK EVERYONE SAYS IT'S FINE FOR US TO PROCEED. LET ME THERE IS NO OPPOSITION WITNESS ON ME SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY EITHER FOR OR AGAINST SEE NON REMOTE LINES FOR AGAINST. TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD OPEN UP THE LINES TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. ABSOLUTELY I JUST LIKE TO INFORM YOU MISTER GARCIA HAS JOINED MR GARCIA PLEASE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU APOLOGIES YOU'RE BEING A BIT LATE HAVE A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS DAVID GARCIA OF THE POLICY DIRECTOR DETERRENCE AND ACROSS THE INNOVATION I UC BERKELEY AND I'M HERE TO LOOK AT SOME OF OUR RECENT WORK. FUNDED ON AN IMPACT FEES AND HOW LEVY SIX OF TWO ALIGNS WITH SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT SELL OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS WE PUBLISH THREE UNIQUE PIECES OF RESEARCH ON THIS EXACT TOPIC WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE STATE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AS A PERSON ALL DAY THAT FEES. ARE A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR CITIES LOOKING TO MITIGATE THE REAL IMPACT THE NEW HOUSING HAVE BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THESE ARE NOT ALWAYS CALCULATED OR IMPOSED IN TRANSPARENT. EQUAL MANNERS THE WEIGHT WHICH MAY LEAD TO OVERLY BURDENSOME P. AMOUNTS ON NEW HOMES WHICH ULTIMATELY INCREASES THE PRICE. FOR THAT NEW CALL INTO OUR RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT SIMPLE CHANGES IN THE CALCULATION. CONDITION OF IMPACT FEES CAN MORE APPROPRIATELY ALIGN THE CITY WITH THE ACTUAL IMPACTS OF THE HOUSING WHILE ALSO LOWERING DEVELOPMENT COSTS OVERALL SO FOR EXAMPLE SHOOTING THREE PER SQUARE FOOT CALCULATION FOR CERTAIN FEES RATHER THAN A PER UNIT BASIS. CAN IN SOME CASES MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT YOU IMPACTS AND RESULT IN MORE REASONABLE COST SO THAT THIS CHANGE ALSO CREATES A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SMALLER HOMES WHICH CAN BE CHARGED DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH AMOUNT HE'S IN JURISDICTIONS THAT. JUST USE PRE APPLICATIONS- SO AGAIN IMPACT THESE ARE REALLY TECHNICAL COMPLEX ISSUE BUT THEIR PROPER CALCULATION AND ALLOCATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT THESE ARE TRULY REFLECTIVE OF NEW IMPACTS- THIS BILL TAKES REASONABLE STEPS TOWARDS BRINGING MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THE BEST PRACTICES. AND SO I WOULD URGE TO SUPPORT TODAY AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS CONTINUED. WORK ON THIS REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WERE GOING TO. THE OPERATOR FOR ANYMORE OF THE WISH TO SPEAK AND IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SIX OH TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO. AGAIN ONE ZERO FOR SUPPORT OF AB SIX OH TWO.

VERSUS A STRUCTURE DOWN IN ALHAMBRA- THE AVAILABILITY OF WOOD IN ALL THESE OTHER IN A AND A DISTANCE IT HAS TO BE TRAVEL TO DO THAT RAISES THOSE COSTS CONSIDERABLY IS DOES THIS TYPE OF STUDY- ALLOW FOR THOSE KIND OF DIFFERENCES OR DID THEY JUST DECIDE WHAT IT SHOULD COST GREAT QUESTION OF TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CLARIFICATION SO THIS WOULD NOT BE UP A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT'S ACTUALLY A TEMPLATE. TEMPLATE FOR WHICH IN A JURISDICTION COULD TAKE WITH THE BLANK LINES AND CUSTOMIZE IT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THEIR SETTING WHETHER IT'S A BERMAN OR WHETHER YOU'RE IN A RURAL SETTING- THIS IS JUST A TEMPLATE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED IT'S ACTUALLY THERE AS A TOOL IF THE.

PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE THEM AND GENERALLY IT'S ALWAYS YOU KNOW THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY OPPOSES THEM I DON'T I DON'T BLAME THEM. IT RAISES THE COST FOR DOING DEVELOPMENT ACOSTA BUT IT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THIS MASSIVE DROP BECAUSE I THINK EVERYBODY HAS INFLATED THOSE NEXT TO STUDY SO MUCH. AND PUT THOSE IMPACT FEES UP SUPER HIGH BECAUSE I THINK IT'S LIKE DONE LIKE AND **** NILLY PROCESS IT'S A VERY LONG PROCESS IT TAKES UP TO YEARS- TO DO THOSE. AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE DROP THAT THEY THEY'RE HOPING TO SEE.

IT'S PAST YOUR THIRTY ANY RESPONSE TO THAT YES AND AGAIN IT'S NOT A MANDATE THIS IS A TEMPLATE THAT IS PROVIDED AS A CHOICE. AND THE FACT IS. WE HOPE THERE IS A BACKDROP BECAUSE THERE ARE GOOD PLAYERS GOOD ACTORS OUT THERE CITIES MUNICIPALITIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ALL OF THEM ARE IN LINE HOWEVER- AS IDEAL AS THAT MAY BE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOOD ACTORS AND THAT THERE ARE SOME JURISDICTIONS THAT CHARGE IMPACT FEES. AS HIGH AS 17% OF THE COST OF THE UNIT SO THIS IS TO ADDRESS THOSE THAT MAY NOT QUITE BE IN LIFE HI I UNDERSTAND THAT AND- YOU KNOW I RESPECT THAT ALSO THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. SOME OF ANY OF THE FINAL COMMENTS. I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING THIS FORWARD I KNOW THIS IS BEEN A NUMBER OF YEARS OF WORK THAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING YOUR FRIEND REALLY LEADING THE SPACE AND HOW TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS.

AND WITHOUT A LESSER ANY FINAL COMMENTS YOU ANY FINAL WORDS. YES AND YES THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO HAVE A COOPER I. JUST FOR THE FACT THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD KNOW.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS ON THE HAVE A SETTLEMENT THREE OF US OR LIKE TO START BY. THANKING THE CHAIRS COMMITTEE STUFF WITH A THOROUGH EVALUATION I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AS AMENDED AT TEN FORTY THREE WILL ADD AN ADDITIONAL INCOME CATEGORY THE STATE HOUSING LAW COMPRISED OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING BELOW THE FIFTEEN PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS ALLOW THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DEFINE INCOME CATEGORIES PROVIDE FORMULAS FOR CALCULATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. CURRENT LAW DEFINES FOUR INCOME CATEGORIES WITH THE LOWEST CATEGORY COMPRISED OF HOUSEHOLDS LIVING BELOW THE 30% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. HOWEVER THERE'S GREAT DISPARITY BETWEEN HOUSEHOLDS GROUPED TOGETHER INTO INTO THIS CATEGORY. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THE ANNUAL INCOME FOR A HOUSEHOLD OF FOUR. IN THIS CATEGORY WAS THIRTY THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED. HOWEVER HOUSEHOLDS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OF THOSE WERE ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS. REPORTED INCOMES OF LESS THAN SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. A RECENT REPORT FROM L. A. COUNTY. WHICH INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY TO CAPTURE THEIR MOST LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. INDICATED THAT ABOUT RENTERS LIVE BELOW THE 15% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. THAT IS HOUSEHOLDS ALMOST 90% 9090% SPENT MORE. THAN 50% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING COSTS. AB TEN FORTY THREE ADDRESSES THIS GAP IN OUR STATE HOUSING POLICY. BY ESTABLISHING A PERSONS AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS CATEGORY. AND A FORMULA TO CALCULATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS FOR THIS GROUP. THIS NEW CATEGORY WOULD BE MAKE IT MADE UP OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING BELOW THE 15% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. AB TEN FORTY THREE IS SPONSORED BY L. A. COUNTY THAT THE PROVIDE TESTIMONY I WOULD LIKE TO TURN OVER. TO AMY BOWE DIRECTOR RECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES DEPARTMENT OF REGIONAL PLANNING. TO THE OPERATOR IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALARMIST BOTHA TO SPEAK. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AMY ABOUT IRAQ AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL PLANNING FOR THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THANK YOU ALSO TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIVAS FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC IN HER CHAIR CHU AND THE CONSULTANT FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. AB TEN FORTY THREE WHAT AMEND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DEFINE A NEW INCOME CATEGORIES FOR CALCULATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS. AS DISCUSSED THIS NEW DEFINITION WOULD BE COMPRISED OF FAMILIES LIVING WITHIN THE INCOME BRACKET. CURRENTLY THERE IS NO FORMULA IN THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO CALCULATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING COSTS FOR HOUSEHOLDS OF LESS THAN 30% AND MINE SH THIS PROPOSED NEW INCOME CATEGORY. BETTER CAPTURES THOSE RESIDENTS WHOSE SOLE SOURCE OF INCOME AND SUPPLEMENTAL SECURITY INCOME SUCH AS THE ELDERLY OR THE DISABLED. AS WAS NOTED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE COUNTY HAS ISSUED AN ANNUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING OUTREACH REPORT PREPARED BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP CORP CORPORATION. OF THE MOST RECENT REPORT FROM TWENTY NINETEEN ACTUALLY SHOWS EVEN WORSE NUMBERS THAN THOSE JUST QUOTED THAT'S MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND AS OPPOSED TO ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND. OF PRINTERS ARE NOW WITHIN THAT DISTURBINGLY OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS 69% IDENTIFY AS PEOPLE OF COLOR. INCLUDING 136% BLACK MAX 17% BLACK AND 16% API. AMENDING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE WOULD ALLOW THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OR THE STATE. TO REQUIRE SATISFIED UNITS BE PROVIDED AT THIS VERY SPECIFIC INCOME LEVEL OR REQUIRE REPLACEMENT UNITS BE MADE AVAILABLE. IT IS A SIMPLE AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE FAR REACHING POSITIVE BENEFITS IN STABILIZING HOUSING OPTIONS FOR IN SHORT THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES SUPPORTS THIS BILL AND ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT AS WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I YIELD THE REMAINDER OF MY TIME. IF WE CAN NOW GO TO ANY WITNESSES.

WORD FOR DIET COKE SILVA. KIRK SILVA I WICKS. CITY FORTY TWO SIR. ALL RIGHT WE'LL WAIT FOR OTHERS TO ANALYSTS MOVED FILE ITEM THREE AB TWELVE TWENTY. THANK YOU MR AGAIN ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY WOMAN THREE OF US I WOULD LIKE TO START BOB I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THE THOROUGH EVALUATION OF THIS LEGISLATION FOR CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS. THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING OUT THE LANGUAGE OF STAKEHOLDERS AND APPROPRIATIONS ON HER BEHALF I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS CHARACTERIZE ON PAGE FIVE OF THE NELSON'S. LAST SESSION ISRAEL RIVAS AUTHORED AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE WHICH IS AN ATTEMPT TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY SOLUTION FOR THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS. AB TWELVE TWENTY IN THE FOM BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A RESULT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT RESTRUCTURING CHANGES. SO WE CAN ENSURE WE'RE PROVIDING GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT TO HOW THE STATE IS COMBATING HOMELESSNESS. AS AMENDED AB TWELVE TWENTY MAKES A NUMBER OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT HOMELESS COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL. THIS MEASURE RENAMES THE HOMELESS COUNCIL TO THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. HIS NAME MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL. ALMOST AT THE STAGE FOR THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERSHIP AND COMMITTEES. THE COUNCIL IS TASKED WITH VARIOUS GOALS AND AMONG THEM ARE IDENTIFYING RESOURCE TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS CREATING PARTNERSHIPS AMONG STATE AGENCIES. PROMOTING SYSTEM INTEGRATIONS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY. MAKING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS. MEMBERSHIP WILL CONSIST OF DIRECTORS AND SECRETARIES OF THE STATE INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED HOMELESSNESS EXPERIENCE INCLUDING UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH UNDER TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE. IN MARCH THE HOMELESS COUNCIL ADOPTED ITS FIRST EVER ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE THE ACTION PLAN PROVIDES THE DETAILS ON HOW THE HOMELESS COUNCIL CHIEF ITS GOALS. ADDRESSING A PROBLEM AS COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED AS HOMELESS AS NOT ONLY REQUIRES THE INVOLVEMENT OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE. BUT WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THE COUNCILS COMPRISE A STATE LEADERS AND EXPERIENCED INDIVIDUALS WERE COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE ACTION PLAN AND REDUCING HOMELESSNESS. THIS ACTUAL PLAN COMES AT A CRITICAL TIME AS THE BIDEN HERE'S MINISTRATIONS BEGAN TO FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF HOMELESSNESS AS WELL. AS SUCH THE STATE MUST ENSURE PROPER AND EFFICIENT COORDINATION AMONG STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS OTHER STATES IN THE COUNTRY HAVE SIMILAR COUNCIL STRUCTURES SO THIS IS A STANDARD MODEL. WE KNOW THE THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A STATE WIDE CRISIS THIS LEGISLATION THAT LEGISLATURE AND SPECIFICALLY THIS COMMITTEE HAS DEDICATED SUBSTANTIAL ENERGY AND RESOURCES TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. WELL STATE FUNDING PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST HOMELESSNESS FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE SYSTEMIC ISSUES WE MUST ENSURE THE COUNCILIS COMPRISED OF STATE LEADERS AND DEPARTMENT HEADS WHO ARE BEST EQUIPPED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE AND RESPOND TO HOMELESSNESS.

FIRST GOOD EVENING CHAIRED A MEMBER- COULD START A POLICY DIRECTOR TALKING CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA THE NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION WITH A MISSION TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA HAS ACCESS TO A STATE SAVE ON THE PORTAL PLACE TO LIVE SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN HOMES COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL HAS BEEN TASKED WITH MANY THINGS MOST NOTABLY COORDINATING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS WHILE ALSO ADMINISTERING OVER A BILLION DOLLARS RESOURCES INTO. RECENTLY THE COORDINATING COUNCIL ADOPTED ITS FIRST EVER ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS AND ALSO LAUNCHED IN THE HOME WITH DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM WHICH WILL ENABLE THE STATE LOCAL PARTNERS TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS FOR IMPROVING PROGRAMS FOSTERING COLLABORATIONS AND ADDRESSING INEQUALITY IN A RESEARCH REPORT THE L. A. I THINK A PROBLEM AS COMPLEX AND INTERCONNECTED OF HOMELESSNESS REQUIRED THE INVOLVEMENT OF DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE AND COLLABORATION AMONG ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE KNOW THAT STRUCTURAL CHANGES ARE NECESSARY FOR THE STATE TO BETTER ATTRACT THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AB TWELVE TWENTY MAKES CHANGES TO THE HOME ACCORDING TO FINANCING COUNCIL BY RENAMING IT THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AND CHANGING THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COUNCIL TO BE THE SECRETARIES AND DIRECTORS OF AGENCY FEES REASONABLE CHANGES ARE LINED WITH THOUGH THE WAY MANY OTHER STATES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY APPROACHED INTERAGENCY COUNCIL THE SWELL OF THE FEDERAL INTERAGENCY COUNCIL AND WILL HELP THE HOME ACCORDING TO FIND A COUNCIL BETTER COORDINATE AMONG AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS SHOULD SHOULD THE STATE GOAL OF ENDING HOMELESSNESS.

FOR CALLING UP FILE ITEM TWENTY TWO AB FORTINO ONE. MISS FRIEDMAN THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN% MEMBERS YOU KNOW HOUSING IS A TOUGH SUBJECT AND THERE'S OFTEN A LOT OF DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THINGS BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE A BILL THAT'S BEING SUPPORTED BY THAT YOUR CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE'S IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY AND IT GETS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I THINK WE MAYBE HAVE A SWEET SPOT- THIS BILL IS ALLOWING DEVELOPERS TO TAKE A MORE MARKET- DRIVEN APPROACH. TO THE WAY THAT HOUSING IS PUT TOGETHER A MANY CITIES PROP ALMOST ALL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRED NEW RESIDENTIAL OR COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE ON SITE PARKING SPACES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE REPAIRS IS PRETTY ARBITRARY AND IT VARIES ACROSS THE STATE APARTMENTS OFTEN INCLUDE ONE OR TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES MUST PROVIDE ONE SPACE FOR EVERYONE TO TWO HUNDRED SQUARE FEET. FREQUENTLY CAUSING MORE SPACE BE PROVIDED FOR PARKING AND FOR THE BUSINESS ITSELF AND THIS IS A FACTOID THAT I PICKED UP THAT I THINK IS REALLY SHOCKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE DEVOTE APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF SPACE- OF SPACE FOR EVERY CAR THAT'S IN EXISTENCE BUT ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED SQUARE FEET OF HOUSING FOR EVERY PERSON THAT LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES. SO IT SHOWS THAT OUR PRIORITIES IN MY MIND- BOOK IF YOU CONFUSED BUT THESE ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATES THAT CITIES PUT ON DEVELOPERS ARE OFTEN DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU A VERY GOOD RESULT- MANDATORY PARKING REQUIREMENTS HAVE LED TO AN OVERSUPPLY PARKING. LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE HAS EIGHTEEN POINT SIX MILLION PARKING SPACES THAT'S TRUE FOR EVERY RESIDENT THE POLICY ENCOURAGES CURTIS WITH DEPENDENCE AND DISCOURAGES MASS TRANSIT USES INCREASING VEHICLE MILESTRAVELED IT'S ALSO ONE URBAN AREAS OF FAIR AND EVEN IN SUBURBAN A ROLLER IS OFTEN A VERY INEFFICIENT USE OF SPACE IT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO WALK FURTHER THEREFORE DRIVE FURTHER AS OPPOSED TO OLDER DOWNTOWNS WE TYPICALLY HAVE. ROWS OF SHOPS WITH PARKING. SOMEWHERE ELSE OR IN A STRUCTURE. MANDATORY PER REQUIRE ALSO WORSEN HELLO. OF YOUR SHORTAGE BY RAISING THE COST OF HOUSING PRODUCTION. ON AVERAGE A GARAGE COSTS TWENTY FOUR TO THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE TO BUILD. A COST IS PASSED ON TO HOUSEHOLDS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY OWN A CAR. ADDITIONALLY ONSITE PARKING TAKES UP SPACES THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR ADDITIONAL PARKING UNITS. AND IT'S INSIDE THIS IS BILL I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY PEOPLE THAT I KNOW PERSONALLY IN MY OWN CITY. WILL HAVE A HOUSE WHO WANTED TO PUT A COUPLE OF UNITS BEHIND IN THE MULTI FAMILY AREA BUT WE'RE TOLD THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO ASK ADD SEVEN MORE PARKING SPACES. ON A SMALL LOT IN AN AREA WHERE THEY REALLY DIDN'T NEED THE PARKING. AB FORTINO ONE DOES NOT PROHIBIT DEVELOPERS FROM ADDING PARKING IN PLACES THAT HAVE DONE THIS LIKE BUFFALO NEW YORK AND SAN DIEGO. THE TRUTH IS A DEVELOPER STILL AT PARKING BUT THE RIGHT SIZE THE PARKING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT THAT THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER. AND IN BUFFALO WHAT THEY FOUND WAS THAT- MULTI THAT- DEVELOPERS THAT WE'RE DOING MULTI USE- MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS WORK WITH EACH OTHER TO SHARE PARKING AND SE THAT SPACE A LOT MORE EFFICIENCY. EFFICIENTLY THE BILL CONTINUES TO REQUIRE THE M. CODE REQUIRED PARKING FOR DISABLED PEOPLE FOR DISABLED PARKING AND FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE MEASURE WOULD REDUCE CAR DEPENDENCE LOWER CARBON EMISSIONS AND ENCOURAGE MORE HOUSING BE BUILT OR TRANSIT. AND ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING FOR LOWER COST IF THEY COULD THEN PASS ALONG TO RESIDENTS. SO AGAIN THAT MISSING MIDDLE AB FOUR ZERO ONE IS SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIA YIMBY SPUR ABANDONED HOUSE IN THE- HOUSING L. A. AND THE COUNCIL OF INFILL BUILDERS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS AFTERNOON- KIMBERLY DELLINGER DONE WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND MIA KANG SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FROM RELATED CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

AS YOU HEARD EXAMPLE PARKING REQUIREMENTS MAKE NEW DEVELOPMENT IN PEOPLE READING THOUSANDS OF POTENTIAL HOUSING SITES TAKEN UNDER UTILIZED THE PROJECT THANK YOU GET BUILT ON SITE PARKING AND ADD AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SPACE TO BUILD AND AS YOU KNOW THE PART BECAUSE WITHOUT DIRECTLY ON THE DEVELOPER'S RENTERS AND HOME BUYERS BY ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN TRANSIT RICH AREAS ALLOWING DEVELOPERS. FLEXIBILITY TO RIGHT SIZE THE PARKING WE BELIEVE EIGHTY FORTINO ONE WILL CUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OFF THE COST OF NEW HOUSING PRODUCTION LOWER HOUSING COSTS FOR RESIDENTS WHO DON'T OWN CARS I'M WANTED NEW POTENTIAL FOR CALIFORNIANS VACANT AND UNDER UTILIZED LAND SUPPLY. UNLEASH A MARKET DRIVEN APPROACH TO PARKING IN ADDITION A RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT EIGHTY FORTINO ONE WILL ACTUALLY PROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CALIFORNIA CAN'T BE BONUS LAUNCH AN INCLUSIONARY HOUSING PROGRAMS LKE THE TNC PROGRAM IN LOS ANGELES AB FORTINO ONE WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOPERS TO BALANCE THE ADDITIONAL DENSITY AND PARKING THE- ALLOWING FOR MORE DEALS TO PENCIL OUT IN THE VERY PLACE WE WANT TO HELP THE- IN EXISTING COMMUNITIES NEAR TRANSIT. DEVELOPERS BUILD FOR THE MARKET AND THE MARKET STILL WANT PARKING THE RECENT SURVEY OF LHC PROJECT SHOWS THAT DEVELOPERS CHOSE TO MAXON DENSITY INCENTIVE AND PROVIDE OVER 80% MORE PARKING AND THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY REQUIRED AB FORTINO ONE WILL PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOPERS TO SERVE A WIDER RANGE OF HOUSING TIGHT. WILL HELP SMALL BUSINESSES LKE RESTAURANTS IN TRANSIT RICH LOCATION TO PERMANENTLY EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS OUTDOORS I CREATE MORE PRODUCTIVE USES FOR EMPTY PARKING SPACES. AB FOURTEEN R.

HAS BEEN REFERENCED SEVERAL TIMES TODAY DURING THIS HEARING AND WE ARE ALL WELL AWARE CALIFORNIANS IN THE MIDST OF A HOUSING CRISIS AND ONE OF AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF HOUSING. THERE ARE MANY POLICIES IN PLACE MANY REASONS THAT HOUSING IS UNAFFORDABLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY THE BILL BEFORE YOU TO ADDRESS A NARROW BUT A VERY KEY COMPONENT. OF THE ACTUAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION CONSTRUCTING HOUSING UNITS. AS STATED PARKING IS VERY EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE. REMOVING MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS OF A DIRECT IMPACT AND SAVINGS TO THOSE WHO OCCUPIED UNITS AS WELL AS CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE UNITS TO BE CONSTRUCTED AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THE LONG LIST OF CALIFORNIANS. SEEKING A PLACE TO CALL HOME. FIFTEEN RECOGNIZE TO OTHER POLICIES THE DECLINING RELIANCE ON INDIVIDUAL AUTOMOBILES. UNDERSTANDING COURAGE IS THAT TRUE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY POLICY PREFERENCES FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT NEAR TRANSIT. ELIMINATING MINIMUM PARKING REQUIREMENTS IS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE STATE POLICIES. AND WILL% RESULT IN GREATER AFFORDABILITY IMPACTED UNITS. WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY SHOULD PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE THAT THAT CERTAIN PARKING AVAILABILITY- BE MADE AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE PARTICULAR PROJECT VIABLE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW ONE OF THE GOOD FOCUSED BILL THAT GOES DIRECTLY AT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTING HOUSING THANK YOU AFTER THE AFTER CALL BRINGING IT FORWARD AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT.

GAS EMITTING CARD UNFORTUNATELY AB FORTINO ONE CURRENTLY DOESN'T STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN IT POLICY OBJECTIVES AND THE STATE CRITICAL GOAL OF INCREASING AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE BELIEVE IT MUST BE CONSISTENT QUALITY OF CAPTURING THAT VALUE THAT IS BEING CREATED BY THE REMOVAL OF THE PARKING TO PRODUCE HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SO IN ORDER TO G. DR COLD WITHOUT HAMPERING THE MECHANISM BY WHICH DEVELOPERS INCREASE THE PORTABILITY GREG WE RECOMMEND A COUPLE OF AMENDMENTS TO WHICH IS AT THE ELIMINATE PARKING MINIMUM FOR NON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS NEAR TRANSIT AND ELIMINATE PARKING. RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT NEAR TRANSIT WHERE THE DEVELOPER UTILIZES AND SPEAK ON THE CLOCK.

THANK YOU ARE ROUGHLY HALF OF THE TOWN OF TRUCKEE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. CURRENTLY OF NO OTHERS IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE GREAT THANK YOU LET'S BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION MR WARD I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD- WE DID SOMETHING SIMILAR IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO NOW AND- DIDN'T COME WITHOUT OPPOSITION A LOT OF CONCERN OUT THERE BUT WE FOUND WAS THAT IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA IN PARTICULAR- RESIDENTIAL SURVEY FOUND THAT ABOUT 30% OF OUR DEVELOP PARKING SPACES WENT. UNUSED AND SO DEVELOPMENT- COSTS ARE HIGH- FOR PARKING AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING HOUSING MORE AFFORDABLE WE WANT TO TAKE THAT OUT PHILIP THE MARKET DECIDE AND WE ACTUALLY IT'S AN PROJECTS SEE VARIANCES AND NOW THEY CAN DO THAT- EXPLOSIVELY- THROUGHOUT THE CODE. TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE MARKET IS INTERESTED IN PRODUCING UNITS DOESN'T MEAN NO PARKING FOR ANYTHING BUT IF THEY WANT TO TRY THAT FOR A RENTER OR A HOMEOWNER THAT SEEKS TO UNIT NOT TETHERED THE PARKING. WERE ABLE TO DELIVER PLACES WITH LOWER RENTS SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING ABLE TO EMULATE THE STATE WHAT I THINK IT WILL BE HELPFUL AND ALL IT HASN'T BEEN ALREADY OF ALL OF THE BILL. IS PROMOTION. OF THE FORESTS ARE SECOND. SECOND OKAY THE A SECOND. ARE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. TO THE MOISTURE. I APPRECIATE. HM I'M MORE THAN A MAJOR WITH DIFFERENT DIFFERENT YOU KNOW IN OUR AREAS- ACTUALLY I WAS IN URBAN AREAS WHERE THEY HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF- HARPER HIRED IN THE AREA AND YOUR CARD IS EVERYWHERE GOING NEIGHBORHOOD. IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE AND IF NOT ENOUGH- LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO YEAH TO WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE UNIQUE- PERSON SPOKE SHARKS. I THINK YOU. I CAN TELL YOU WHAT THE IN FRONT CALLED IN BECAUSE TRUCK DOWNTOWN HAS A REAL GOES RIGHT THROUGH. AND SO THAT'S CONSIDERED A HIGH TRANSIT AREA AND YOU WILL FOR DAYS WHEN ARE JUST DRIVING AROUND DRIVING AROUND LOOKING FOR SOME PARKING SOMEWHERE. AND THAT'S SUPER FRUSTRATING TO PEOPLE AND- IN IN OUR OUR CITY I KNOW OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE NEGOTIATED WITH DEVELOPERS ABOUT THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS. AND WHEN WE COME OUT WE COME TO SOME AGREEMENT TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PARKING AND TODAY I GO TO SOME OF THOSE THE DEVELOPMENTS THERE EITHER COMMERCIAL OR OFFICE. AND IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO TRY AND PARK JUST LIKE WE PREDICTED SO I PREFERRED TO LEAVE THESE TYPE OF DECISION MAKING. AND USING THE EXACT TOOLS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IF IT'S WEIRD IF THAT WORKS FOR THEIR COMMUNITIES LIKE IT MARKS DOWN IN SAN DIEGO SO I'M KIND OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT GUY I WANT THOSE DECISIONS MADE LOCAL AND THAT'S WHY I'M NOT A STRUGGLE WITH THE- THE KIND OF THE STATE MANDATING THIS AND TAKING THAT CONTROL AWAY FROM THE GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. HEY COMMENTS. I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR- FOR TAKING THIS ON AND- ALSO APPRECIATE YOU AND YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES FOR ENGAGING WITH MY STAFF EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THIS AND LET ME SAY THAT- I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE GOALS OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IN FACT AND SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS- I AUTHORED THE FIRST LOCAL ORDINANCE TO ELIMINATE PARKING MINIMUMS ARE IN OUR DOWNTOWN AREAS NEAR TRANSIT. AND THEN OUR CITY MOVED TO ELIMINATE THESE- PARKING MINIMUMS THROUGHOUT THE CITY AS A NUMBER OF OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE AND I THINK THE GOALS OF ENSURING THAT- IF YOU KNOW. THE FACT IS. THIS POLICY IS ENCOURAGE CARBAPENEMS HAS DISCOURAGED MASS TRANSIT HAS INCREASED VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED- IS SIGNIFICANTLY NOT JUST IMPACTING OUR HOUSING GOALS OUR CLIMATE GOALS. ARE AND APPRECIATE WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE- I ALSO KNOW AND WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE CONCERNS IT'S BEEN RAISED. CRITICALLY WITH REGARDS TO. SOME OF OUR MOST MORE RECENT. DISCUSSIONS AROUND DENSITY BONUS LAW. AND THE TRADE OFFS THAT WE MADE BETWEEN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PARKING FOR MY PERSPECTIVE IF WE CAN REWIND THE CLOCK I DON'T THINK. WE WOULD HAVE TIED SOME OF THESE PAST DENSITY BONUS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OBJECTIVE TO PARKING MINIMUMS BUT WE DID AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH BUT- I APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR WILLINGNESS TO KEEP ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT TOPIC AND- IT AND KNOW IF THERE ARE GOOD CONVERSATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THAT I LOOK FOR TO HEAR ABOUT IT- BUT AT THIS TIME I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD. AS IT CAME OUT OF THE LAST COMMITTEE. I AND WITH THAT. INVESTORS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION THERE'S BEEN A MOTION AND A SECOND. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY FINAL WORDS FIRST OF ALL I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT KIND OF SPORTS PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT BUT- IT'S GOOD- THANK ALL. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW FOOTBALL THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF PARKING OKAY SO. I YOU KNOW I REALLY DO APPRECIATE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED AND WE'VE BEEN THINKING FOR A LOT OF THESE AS WELL AND FROM THE ADVOCATES TO ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. YOU KNOW ALL THIS A VERY QUICKLY THAT YOU KNOW CITIES ALSO HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO DEAL WITH PARKING MANAGEMENT. HOW WE GOT RID OF A LOT OF THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN OUR DOWNTOWN IN GLENDALE BUILT A COUPLE STRUCTURES. AND ACTUALLY FORCED PEOPLE TO WALK AROUND THE DOWNTOWN IT WAS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE SHOPS. AND RUNNING MORE TRANSIT IS A GOAL AND I'M COMMITTED TO TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY TO ALL OF OUR CITIES- THROUGH MY ROLE OF TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT TRANSIT. SO I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOLUTIONS HERE BUT PUTTING IT ALL- THIS ONE SIZE FITS ALL AND DEVELOPERS IT'S SOMETHING THAT JUST ISN'T WORKING ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I DO KNOW THAT THE YOUNGER GENERATION. IS TAKING RIDE SHARE VEHICLES MORE AND A TON OF HIS VEHICLES I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE ARE JUST A NUMBER OF YEARS AWAY AND THEN WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH ALL OF THESE GIANT EMPTY PARKING LOTS. NOT TO MENTION THAT MOST CITIES HAVEN'T DONE PARKING INVENTORIES AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNUSED PARKING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL THAT CAN BE USED SO MUCH MORE CREATIVELY. I'M TO PARK PEOPLE SO I DO APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WESTERN CENTER AND ALL OF OUR FRIENDS AND WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND THEIR CONCERNS. I DO FIND IT A LITTLE IRONIC. TO SAY WE'RE REQUIRING MORE PARKING AND WE KNOW WE NEED SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO BARGAIN SOMETHING AND GIVE IT BACK- I THINK IT RATED ITS FACE THERE'S SOMETHING KIND OF WRONG WITH THAT. AND I WILL ALSO SAY THAT MOST DEVELOPERS OF FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN LEARNING TAKE THE PARKING PRODUCTION ONLY TO SERVICE. THAT HIGHER DENSITY THAT THEY'RE GETTING SO IT'S JUST BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GETTING THAT HIGHER DENSITY YOU NEED THE REDUCTION OTHERWISE YOU HAVE TO ADD SO MUCH PARKING THAT IT DOESN'T WORK OUT. BUT WILL CONTINUE TO TALK WITH THE ADVOCATES AND REALLY APPRECIATE MISTER CHAIR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO KIND OF GO ALONG THIS JOURNEY WITH US AND- THANKS EVERYONE I DO HOPE THAT EVERYBODY CAN FIND. A WAY TO VOTING FOR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM SIR. YOU HAVE A MOTION AND- SECOND. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL- MORE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ASSEMBLY COMEDIAN APPROPRIATIONS TO HI CHIU I SAY ARCHER NOW. YOU KNOW GABRIELLE KALRA. RIGHT KALRA AYE KILEY AYE KILEY I. WARD FOR TI QUICK SILVA. STILL BY WEEKS. TWO THREE FOUR FIVE TWO ONE. YOUR BILL IS OUT. IN I THAT'S REYES EXACTLY THAT'S GONNA DO IF THAT'S ALRIGHT MISTER REAVIS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. WHAT'S IT. THANK YOU FOR THE INDULGENCE OF OUR COLLEAGUES FROM ORANGE COUNTY. FILE ITEM NINETEEN AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO WELL- GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY- COLLEAGUES IN MISTER CHAIR PRECIADO OPPORTUNITY PRESENT THIS BILL- COMMITTEE TODAY AND I'LL START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS REALLY APPRECIATE I THINK THE- THE COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH OUR OFFICE TO ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY STAKEHOLDERS. AND AS WE ALL KNOW- TOO WELL UNFORTUNATELY THAT THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED. I CONTINUE TO- TO- IMPACT- OUR STATE'S WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS- THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE AVAILABLE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOMES AND- GROWING HIGH DEMAND FOR HOUSING HAS LED TO EXCESSIVE RENT BURDENS HOUSING INSTABILITY. AND INCREASING HOMELESSNESS YOU KNOW THE REALITY IS IN MOST CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA LOCAL PLANNING AND REGULATORY SYSTEMS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY. RESTRICT THE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING- AND DO SO IN MANY WAYS AS WE JUST HEARD A BY REQUIRING SOME PARKING SPACE MINIMUMS- IMPOSING BUILDING HEIGHT LIMITS. HAVING LENGTHY- SUPERMINI AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESSES AND HAVING VERY RIGID ZONING- OR DENSITY AND YOU SPACE PLANE SYSTEMS. AND AS STATE OFFICIALS IN AS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTED TO DO MORE IN ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. THERE ARE INCREASING INSTANCES OF LOCAL HIGH HOUSING MEASURES THAT- ARMED CONFLICT WITH STATE HOUSING LAWS AND STATE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS. AS THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS BILL- NOTES FROM THIS COMMITTEE IF A LOCAL VOTER APPROVED MEASURE CONFLICTS WITH STATE HOUSING LAW. EITHER AT THE TIME OF THE MEASURES ADOPTION OR AS A RESULT OF NEWLY ADOPTED STATE HOUSING LAWS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS PLACED IN A- A PERILOUS LEGAL- OPPOSITION AND SO CLEARLY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ANY CHALLENGING SITUATION. HAVING TO BALANCE LOCAL PLANNING AND REGULATORY HOUSING MEASURES AND THEN WORKING TO COMPLY WITH EVOLVING STATE HOUSING LAW. SO OFTEN LOCAL OFFICIALS FACE A CATCH TWENTY TWO. GIVEN THAT EITHER FAILING TO IMPLEMENT LOCAL HOUSING RELATED MEASURES. OR FAILING TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN ASPECTS OF STATE HOUSING LAW CAN BOTH RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION. SO THIS LEGISLATION THIS BILL CREATES A PROCESS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AVOID THIS CATCH TWENTY TWO- TO AND TO SEEK A JUDICIAL VALIDATION THAT A LOCAL MEASURE OR VOTER INITIATIVE IS IN CONFLICT. WITH STATE HOUSING LAW. AND SO CONSISTENT WITH ESTABLISHED STATE VALIDATION PROCEDURES THE OPTION FOR JUDICIAL VALIDATION CREATED BY THIS BILL. WOULD RESULT IN AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL RULING. ON THE ISSUE A QUESTION OF STATE AND LOCAL PREEMPTION RELATED TO HOUSING LOS. AND WOOD- IT WOULD PROVIDE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO CHOOSE TO USE THIS OPTION OR TOOL. WITH LEGAL CERTAINTY ABOUT THEIR HOUSING OBLIGATIONS OR REQUIREMENTS. IT'S HERE WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON OR THIS EVENING AD TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY AND ADDRESS ANY TACKLE QUESTIONS ARE SERRA KARLINSKY A SENIOR POLICY ADVISER FOR SPUR AND CHRISTOPHER ELMENDORF A LAW PROFESSOR UC DAVIS WITH EXPERTISE IN LAND USE WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK A MYSTERY OF US LET'S GO TO THE MAIN WITNESSES TO MS KARLINSKY AND TO PROFESSOR. ELMENDORF. TO THE OPERATOR. CARE MISTER CHAIR UP. THIS CALL IS CLEAR MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN THANK YOU GOD BLESS YES PLEASE OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS TERRA KARLINSKY AND I AM SENIOR ADVISER FOR. A PUBLIC POLICY THINK TANK FOCUSED ON CREATING A SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE AND PROSPEROUS REGION AND STATE. HOW TO SPONSOR AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. I'D LIKE TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON MY DISABILITY THAT. I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED PIEDMONT WHICH IS AN INCORPORATED CITY WITHIN THE CITY OF OAKLAND. HE'S NOT AS WEALTHY AND 70% WHITE IT WAS ONCE KNOWN AS THE CITY OF MILLIONAIRES THE AVERAGE HOME PRICES ON THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THE WAKE OF THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD MANY BLACK CONNECTOR STAND BY AND ALLOW BUSINESS AS USUAL. PEOPLE IN THE VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATION CALLED THE PIEDMONT RACIAL EQUITY CAMPAIGN OR CRACK. AND CRACK HOUSING WORK WE QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THE TO THE PIEDMONT HAS WITHIN ITS CITY CHARTER. REQUIREMENT DATING BACK NEARLY A HUNDRED YEARS BUT ANY DINING CHANGES NEED TO BE APPROVED BY VOTERS. WE ALSO LEARNED AT PIEDMONT IT'S LIKELY TO BE ALLOCATED A MUCH SIX HUNDRED UNITS AND HAVING TO PLAN FOR ITS PART. OF ITS REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION. I A HUNTER AND SIXTY. HUNDRED AND- UNITS AND VERY INCOME HOUSING. THERE'S NO WAY FOR PIEDMONT ACCOMMODATED THREE ALLOCATION WITH THE CURRENT CHARTER RESTRICTIONS. WE ALSO LEARNED THAT THERE ARE OTHER SHOULD FICTIONS LANDSCAPE AND SHARE THE CHALLENGES AND ENTRENCH CONSTRAINT. THESE CONSTRAINTS ON PARTS OF THE STATE HOUSING LAW AND ENSHRINE RACIAL SEGREGATION. THEY DO SO NOT BY ACCIDENT BUT BY DESIGN. ENTRENCH CONSTRAINT CODIFY INCLUSIONARY ZONING FOR APARTMENT BUILDINGS THE SMALLER HOMES ARE RENDERED ILLEGAL. INCLUSIONARY ZONING GRANT COUNTY THAT THERE HAS BEEN GOAL OF RACIAL. AND ECONOMIC INTEGRATION. MANY SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINTS ARE THE WHICH THE STATE AND TO ALLOW ON A COMMON MORE AND DIFFERENT TYPES AND LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY IN ORDER TO FURTHER IF THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS. BUT HE SAID IT OR NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO FURTHER FAIR HOUSING WITHOUT AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL. MEASURES STARTING LOCAL CONTROL OF ECONOMY WORKS IN THE BACK MAJORITY JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. AND THAT RESTORED LAND USE DECISIONS TO LOCALLY ELECTED BODIES WHO NEED TO USE THEIR GOOD JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION ABOUT BALANCING THE DESIRES. THE NEIGHBORS WITH APARTMENTS IN STATE LAW. WE WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE BY EMPHASIZING THAT THE TOOL COMPLETELY OPTIONAL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF MY COMMENTS AND WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB. THIRTEEN TWENTY JAIL AND WITH THAT PASSWORD. KAREN MEMBERS CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU. THANK YOU I'M CHRIS OUTDOOR I'M A LAW PROFESSOR AT UC DAVIS AND MY REMARKABLE PRODUCT PROVIDE LEGAL CONTEXT FOR THE BILL. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO YEARS OF THE WELL ESTABLISHED LEGAL LEGAL MECHANISM TO HELP THIRTIES AVOID THE TRAIN WRECK. IT WILL OTHERWISE RESULT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CLIMATE ADAPTATION IT CRASHED INTO VOTER ADOPTED GROWTH CONTROL THE LOCAL LEVEL. THIS LEGAL MECHANISM IS CALLED VALIDATION. IT WAS ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED PROVIDE INSURANCE TO MENISCAL BONTA THAT'S RICH. A CRAZY COUNCIL PASSED A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT IS A WINDOW OF TIME IN SHOW UP IN COURT TO CONTEST TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF THE RESOLUTION. OR TO REQUIRED TO SCHEDULE VALIDATION ACTION TO HELP OTHERS WHAT MATTERS. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO BUT USE THIS MECHANISM TO CONFIRM THE VALIDITY OF A REVOLUTION DAY KNOWLEDGE. CITY HARDER PROVISION WORKLOAD ROOFTOP THAT MEASURE HAS BEEN PREEMPTED BY STATE HOUSE ALL. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO DOES NOT TELL PREEMPTIVELY LOCAL MEASURES THAT ARE NOT NOW CREATE IT. NOR DOES IT CHANGE LEGAL STANDARD FOR PREEMPTION. JUST CREATE THE PROCEDURAL FRAMEWORK THROUGH IT CITIES MAY OBTAIN LEGAL CERTAINTY AT LOW RISK ABOUT THEIR OBLIGATIONS. WE NEED FOR THE BILL WELL ILLUSTRATED BY THE GRAPH. AND PETER'S THAT NEEDED TO BE HELPFUL OR SORRY YOU MAY BE UP AND IT IS THE CHARTER REQUIRES VOTER APPROVAL OF MAJOR OF ANY VISION THE CITY VOTERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY REJECTED HOUSING ELEMENT. MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO THE CITY COUNCIL DECIDED TO SEEK A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION WHETHER THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS IT'S CHARTER IS PREEMPTED BY STATE LAW. GET THE CASE WILL HAVE BEEN HEARD. YOU WON'T BE HEARD UNTIL AFTER THE CITY'S HOUSING ELEMENT DO. LOCAL ANTI HOUSING ACCESS TO INTERVENE IN THE CASE AND THEY ARGUED THAT THE COURT LACKS JURISDICTION AND CANNOT PROVIDE AROUND. AB THIRTEEN TWENTY TWO WOULD PROVIDE YOUR PATH OR WORK FOR ANY UNITS IN OTHER CITIES. BEFORE CLOSING I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THIS BILL IT'S BEEN A REAL GROUP AFTER. SPUR ABOUT THE BALL ROLLING I ADDED SOME IDEAS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CONTRIBUTED MORE IDEAS AND WE'RE WORKING WITH ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING APPLICANTS TO MAKE THE BILL BETTER.

TWO HUNDRED. AGAIN WE'D APPRECIATE A SHORT PRESIDENT. YES HI GOOD EVENING- CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS SYLVIA AGUILAR AND I AM THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF THE TWO HUNDRED- I FEEL RIGHT I THINK YOU CAN COALITION FOCUSED ON INCREASING HOMEOWNERSHIP AS A MEANS OF CLOSING THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP FOR MINORITIES MILLENNIALS AND GENERATION Z. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU AND TO EXPRESS OUR COALITION SUPPORT FOR A BI. TEN NINETY AND COMMAND ASSEMBLY MEMBER CORP SILVA FOR AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION THAT WILL CREATE A HOMEOWNERSHIP TASK FORCE CONSISTING OF MEMBERS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS AND INTERESTS FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE PRIMARY WAY FOR FAMILIES TO BUILD WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND HELPED BUILD THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THAT EMERGED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. AND ALKALI TRANSLATION STATE HOMEOWNERSHIP IS THE GATEWAY TO ECONOMIC SECURITY AND INTERGENERATIONAL WEALTH. IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS AND THE VICTIMS OF THE HOUSING CRISIS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MEMBERS OF BLACK. NOT NEXT NATIVE AMERICAN AND ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS MILLENNIALS AND YOUNGER CALIFORNIANS OF ALL RACES. THESE GROUPS FACE SIMILAR EXCLUSION AND OBSTACLES TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND THEY ARE THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND WE BELIEVE GIVING THEM PATHWAYS TO HOMEOWNERSHIP IT'S CRITICAL FOR A VIBRANT AND EQUITABLE STATE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LOWEST HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IN THE COUNTRY SO CLOSING THIS HOMEOWNERSHIP GAP IS ESSENTIAL TO CLOSING THE GENERATIONAL AND RACIAL WEALTH GAP IN OUR STATE AND THAT IS WHY THE CREATION OF THE TASK FORCE WILL BE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING BARRIERS AND DISPARITIES TO MAKE EQUITY AND HOUSING AND ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOMES A REALITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI.

THANK YOU I'M FOR THE MOVE IN THE SECOND SO BRIEFLY I EIGHTY USE IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING CAN PROVIDE SOLUTIONS TO HELP THE CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS FOR MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. YET THERE UNDER UTILIZING THE COASTAL ZONE IN PART DUE TO THE TIME INTENSIVE COASTAL DEVELOPMENT PERMIT RECEIPT IF YOU PROCESS. THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS IN RECENT YEARS SUCCESSFULLY PASS LAWS TO STREAMLINE THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THESE FOR EIGHTY YEARS IN SUPPORT OF HOUSING. HOWEVER WHILE THE HOOK DOES HELP CITIES THEY DID NOT EXTEND TO SEE PEAS WHICH ARE A STATE PROCESS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT. THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CLARIFY THE REGULATORY PROCESS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT HOWEVER IT IS NOT EXPRESSLY WITHIN THE COMMISSION SCOPE TO PROMOTE SOLUTIONS. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE FORTY YEARS AGO WITH THE OPPOSITION FROM THE COMMISSION THE LEGISLATURE AMENDED THE COASTAL ACT TO REMOVE LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING POLICIES FROM ITS JURISDICTION. THIS BILL REINSTATE THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICIES REPEALED TO GIVE THE COMMISSION THE AUTHORITY TO PROTECT EXISTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ENSURE THAT NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS CONSISTENT WITH COASTAL ACT POLICIES. THIS WILL PROVIDE NEW HOUSING SOLUTIONS AND ENSURE THAT NOT JUST VISITORS SERVING ACCOMMODATIONS BUT ALSO RESIDENTIAL ACCESS TO THE COAST IS BETTER AFFORDED TO ALL CALIFORNIANS.

THE ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION ON HOUSING IN THE AYE BANK ACT CREATES A FINANCING GAP BY EXCLUDING ALL PROJECTS THAT CONTAIN ANY ELEMENTS HOUSING. FOR EXAMPLE PROJECTS THAT HAVE PROPERTY HOUSING FOR SCHOOLS GROUNDSKEEPERS ARE OPERATED FACILITIES SUMMER AND YOUTH CAMPS AND TREATMENT RELATED HOUSING FOR SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT BE FINANCED BY BANK UNDER AB TWELVE NINETY SEVEN THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE.

TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS REQUIRING ALL JURISDICTIONS CITIES AND COUNTIES AND STATE AGENCIES TO CREATE ACTIONABLE PLANS TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS BY 90% OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND ESTABLISHING A HOMELESS INSPECTOR GENERAL TO ASSURE ACCOUNTABILITY WITH REGARDS TO THESE PLANS IN THESE ANALYSES RATHER THAN WAITING FOR EXPENSIVE TIME CONSUMING LAWSUITS TO FORCE THE QUESTION OF HOW WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AB EIGHT SIXTEEN WOULD PROACTIVELY ESTABLISH PLANS METRICS ACCOUNTABILITY AND ENFORCEMENT OF PROGRESS TOWARD THESE PLANS AND WITH THAT.

GOOD EVENING MISTER TURN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS ADAM LANE ON THE VICE PRESIDENT PROGRAMS FOR THE LA BUSINESS COUNCIL I'M PROUD TO BE TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT SIXTEEN THE L. A. B. C. OF THE PROGRESSIVE BUSINESS ADVOCACY AND RESEARCH ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING OVER FIVE HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS GREATER LOS ANGELES WE HAVE DEDICATED THE BETTER PART OF THE PAST TWO DECADES ADVOCATING FOR SOLUTIONS TO THE WIDENING HOUSING AFFORDABILITY GAP THAT HAVE CONTRIBUTED SO GREATLY. TO THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WE CURRENTLY FACE IN THE MONTHS BEFORE COMING NINETEEN GRIPPED OUR NATION WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE L. A. TIMES ON A COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC OPINION ON LA I FOUND THAT 95% OF LA VOTERS IDENTIFIED HOMELESSNESS AT THE TOP ISSUE FACING SEVEN CALIFORNIA 66% CALLED IT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION AND 75% THE FULL STOP WISHING A LEGAL RIGHT TO SHELTER. THAT LAST STATISTIC IS CRUCIAL HOUSING IS ONE OF THE FEW PUBLIC GOOD THAT WE TREAT AS A COMMODITY WITHOUT AN ENFORCEABLE MANDATE WE LACK A COMMON GOAL TO WORK TOWARDS AND INSTEAD WE HAVE A PATCHWORK OF SOLUTIONS THAT DON'T MEET THE MAGNITUDE OF OUR CRISIS. BY MANDATING A STATEWIDE GAP ANALYSIS AB EIGHT SIXTEEN WILL FINALLY PAYING A FULL PICTURE OF THE HOUSING AND RESOURCES NEEDED FOR HOMELESS POPULATION AND ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN BASED ON DATA. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRED THAT FOLLOW COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE TO THEIR FAIR SHARE LOCAL LEVEL PLANS ALLOW THE STATE TO BETTER TARGET LOCALITIES WITH THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET THEIR TARGETS AND REGION BUT ACROSS OUR TABLE TO ADEQUATE TO TAKE ADEQUATE MEASURES WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO PROVIDE PROPORTIONAL RESOURCES AFRAID OF CONSEQUENCES FROM THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED HOMELESSNESS INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND FINALLY BY SENDING A CLEAR MANDATE TIMELINE AB EIGHT SIXTEEN WILL SPUR INVESTMENT INNOVATION AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WILL HELP US LOWER THE COST OF HOUSING GREAT JOB HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE WAS A SILVER LINING FROM THIS PANDEMIC IT WAS PROGRAMS LIKE HOME HE THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER CROSS SECTORAL STAKEHOLDERS TO HOUSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY AFFORDABLY AND WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES.

AB EIGHT SIX ONE ABOUT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR AND WE- REQUEST YOUR- TRADE BEATRIZ. THANK YOU WE ALSO HAVE ONE WITNESS TESTIFYING BY PHONE IN OPPOSITION. YES JOSH DUGGAR REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION AND COUNTY THE AND ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES WITH URBAN COUNTY CALIFORNIA AND RURAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB EIGHT SIXTEEN BUT HAVE SUGGESTED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS AUTHORED ANY CONSIDERATION WE SHARE THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS AND AGREED THAT PLAYING IN THE MAJOR PART OF THE CHANGE ACHIEVING MEASURABLE AND SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS. FOR THAT REASON WE WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE AUTHOR SPONSORED AND STAFF LAST YEAR ON SIMILAR BILL EIGHTY THIRTY TO SIXTY NINE. AFTER MANY VALUABLE CONVERSATIONS WE REMOVED OPPOSITION TO LAST YEAR'S BILL WITH THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT THAT WOULD HAVE TAKEN UNFORTUNATELY IT DID NOT CONTINUE IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT WE STAND READY TO FULLY ENGAGE IN A MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE THIS YEAR. IN THE HOPES OF REACHING SIMILAR COMMON GROUND GENERALLY OUR CONCERNS OF AB EIGHT SIXTEEN IS THAT IT ALL STARTED BEING A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. COUNTY DEGREE THAT A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY SHOULD INCLUDE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF CLEARLY ARTICULATED GOALS DEFINED ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT COMMENSURATE ONGOING FUNDING TO FULFILL THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU CAN ACHIEVE THE GOALS AND. TRANSPARENT ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES. EIGHTY EIGHT. INCLUDING A MAY FOR COUNTY PARTY GOAL BACK BACK. AND A PLANNING PROCESS REDUCTION TARGETS. IT ALSO INCLUDES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THROUGH ESTABLISHING A HOUSING AND HOMELESS AND INSPECTOR GENERAL ANY COURT INTERVENTION PROCESS. BUT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEFINE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR EACH LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT NOR DID THEY INCLUDE COMMENSURATE FUNDING TO ACHIEVE GOALS OR TO MEET THE TRAINING REQUIREMENTS. AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WILL HAVE SUBMITTED A SERIES OF AMENDMENTS TO SUGGEST A MORE MEASURED APPROACH. INCLUDING FUNDING THE LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS. ANALYZED THE LOCAL PLANT BEFORE SETTING BENCHMARKS AND COMPELLING ACTION AND MAKING THE TIMELINE MORE WORKABLE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR POSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE OFFICE STAFF. AND SPONSORS THAT WE ENJOYED LAST YEAR.
