BUDGET. WONDERFUL WHAT A START WITH THE BUDGET BILL. THE BILL AMEND THE BUDGET DOING YOUR PART TO WHICH IS SB ONE OWNER. WELCOME THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SO THE FIRST BILL BEFORE YOU IS THE BUDGET JUNIOR SP ONE OH NINE THIS IS CLEANUP BAIL FOR THE BUDGET ACT THAT WAS PASSED IN JUNE AND BASICALLY DOES THREE GENERAL THINGS FIRST IS IT MAKES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL. OTHER ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTING THE THREE PARTY. SATISFYING ADDITIONAL TRAILER BILLS THAT ARE PART OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS. GREAT THANK YOU COMING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS DR THIS IS AB ONE ONLINE. YES IF YOU WANT A SONG SB ONE NOT IF YOU WANT TO YEAH I JUST BUT SIMPLY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I THINK THAT CHAIR TING AND STAFF TO THEIR WORK UP MEANING YOU MAY NOT KNOW BUT IN MARCH THIS YEAR GOVERNOR NEWSOME DECLARED A STATE OF EMERGENCY. I IN MY DISTRICT TO THE DEVASTATING FLOODS THAT COST OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE. THIS LANGUAGE THE NICEST HARDSHIP THAT MY DISTRICT FACES BUT BY PROVIDING ABOUT ONE POINT. FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FLOOD RELIEF CLEAN UP TO THE COUNTY OF CINEMA. MOST OF THE EXPENDITURES I THINK OR SUPPORTABLE BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE YOUR MARKS IN THIS TRAILER BILL ON IT'S A COMMENT THAT I HAD ABOUT THE BUDGET BILL IN CHIEF WILL BE PASSED IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO AND I WONDER WHY WE HAVE SO MANY REMARKS IN HERE ONE WOULD CALL IT PORK COLLOQUIALLY AND I'M HOPING THAT THIS ISN'T AN INDICATION OF THINGS TO COME BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S A HEALTHY DIRECTION FOR US TO BE GOING. SO UNDERSTANDING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT. MOST OF THE CHANGES IN HERE WHILE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME SHIFTS IN APPROPRIATIONS. REFLECT UPDATES TO THE THREE PARTY AGREEMENT REACHED IN JUNE SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT. THE PARTIES AGREE TO NEGOTIATIONS BUT IN THE FLURRY OF LAST MINUTE ACTIVITY. WAS NOT ACTUALLY REFLECTED IN THE BILL. OR THERE MIGHT IN PLACES WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ARE AT. ADDITIONAL CHANGES. CERTAINLY FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE. THE BUDGET ACTING JUNE IS THE GOVERNING IN TERMS OF THE REVENUES THAT WERE EXPECTING. SO THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T LIKE TO SEE MARK SWINGS IN ADDITIONAL NEW PROGRAMS AND SPENDING. BEYOND THAT IN. JUNE AND WE THINK. THAT THE BUDGET JUNIOR BEFORE YOU REFLECTS THAT SPIRIT. OKAY THANK YOU AYE AYE. I AGREE WITH YOU DOES REFLECT THE SPIRIT OF WHAT HAPPENED IN JUNE BUT THAT THE PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING WITH IT I DON'T THINK FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE THAT HAVING LOTS OF LEGISLATIVE REMARKS IN THE BUDGET DOCUMENT IS A HEALTHY THING I'M A BIGGER BUT I PEOPLE CRITICAL AS A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY THIS BUT I THINK IT'S A BETTER. IT'S JUST BETTER FOR POP PUBLIC POLICY TO THAT GRANT BROAD FUNDING TO DEPARTMENTS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT TO PUT THE MONEY WHERE IT GOES INSTEAD OF BEING SUBJECTED TO THE POLITICAL PRESSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE BRINGS TO BEAR AND- THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS TRAILER BILL. MISS LEWIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR CASE I'M A QUESTION RELATING TO THE OFFICES MERGING TO SERVICES IN SECTION NINE. THERE'S IT AWARDED TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR LOCAL ASSISTANCE SET UNDER PROVISIONS IT SAYS THE FUNDING PER DEFINING APPROPRIATED IN THIS ITEM IS FOR THECALIFORNIA HEALTH CENTER SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM TO HELP HEALTH CENTERS THAT PROVIDE ABORTION SERVICES. AND MAYBE THE TARGETS FINANCING VANDALISM UP 25% OF THE AMOUNT APPROPRIATE IN THIS ITEM MAY BE USED. FOR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT OF COSTS. I AM VERY CONFUSED ABOUT. WANT WHERE THIS CAME FROM IT WAS THERE SOME SORT OF POLICY BILL THAT WAS PASSED THAT THIS SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT THE FUNDING FOR AND CAN YOU JUST ELABORATE A LITTLE MORE THIS IS VERY BROAD. THE FUNDING IT JUST SAYS. FUNDING FOR THEM. FOR THOSE THAT MAY BE THE TARGETS OF VIOLENCE AND VANDALISM DOESN'T SAY THEY HAVE TO BE AND IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT THE MONEY SUPPOSED TO BE USED FOR. CELL. DO YOU COLLABORATE ON THAT FOR ME SO WE WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO THE MORE DETAILED THIS WAS THE RESULT OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND THE ADMINISTRATION DIDN'T HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT LANGUAGE BUT HAPPY TO GET BACK WITH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. OKAY WHY DEFINITELY WANT ANSWERS TO THAT I THINK CALLING THE PROBABLY WANT THAT TOO IT'S JUST IT'S VERY BROAD AND VAGUE SO I LOOK. FORWARD TO HEARING WHAT THE RESPONSES FROM THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE CLIP ANYMORE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE A PUBLIC ON. AS CHAIR OF ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR VERY BRIEFLY NOT ROBINSON WAS SHOT YOUR AND WE ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE FUNDING FOR THE GREEN BUSINESS PROGRAM THAT IS IN AB ONE ON NINE AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF'S. EFFORTS ON THAT I'VE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WERE STUCK SERVERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE- EXPENSE. OF THE COUNTY OF STANISLAUS URGENCY COMMUNICATION MAN AND HE'S COUNTRY THE FIRE PROTECTION DISTRICT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MR TURN MEMBERS THE ANTI MINETTI HERE ON BEHALF OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD. SPECIFICALLY IN SUPPORT FOR THE TEN NOT TEN MILLION DOLLAR GRANT APPROPRIATION FOR SECURITY AT HEALTH CENTERS OF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL. PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU SO THIS IS NOT I FORGOT TO OPEN WITH THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING SO WE WON'T BE TAKING ANY VOTES WE ARE GOING TO BE HEARING THE ITEMS SO CAN WE MOVE NEXT TO AB ONE TWELVE AS WELL. SB ONE TWELVE. SO THE NEXT BILL IS AS OVER FIRST A STATE IN GENERAL GOVERNMENT A COUPLE OF KEY PROVISIONS. WITH A NEWLY ENACTED OFFICE OF DIGITAL INNOVATION MAKING SURE THAT THE DATA PROVIDED THAT OFFICE REMAINS CONFIDENTIAL AND ALSO THAT THAT OFFICE. THE ANNUAL REPORTS TO THE LEGISLATURE IN ADDITION THIS ELIMINATES THE GAIN AND LOSS ACCOUNT WHICH IS A WHICH IS FOR THE CALCIUM VERS FORMALLY KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA SICKER CHOICE PROGRAM THAT CAME LOS AND COUNTIES ACTION NOT BEING USED BY THAT PROGRAM SO THIS BILL. REMOVES THAT PROVISION IT ALSO CLARIFIES THE USE OF THE BDS SAY THAT DEFICIT SAVINGS IS NOT CLARIFY. LAWS FOR WHAT EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION AND THEN FINALLY ALLOWS FOR MORE DISCRETIONARY AUDITS REVIEWS OF C. D. C. R. I. WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL FROM THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR. THANK YOU LEADING QUESTIONS MISTER OBERNOLTE. SO YOU WHEN YOU SAY IT CLARIFIES THE USE OF THE BDS A ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. YES SO THIS WAS BASICALLY THAT PDSA WAS CREATION FROM A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF TRANSFERS AND THIS WAS INITIALLY FOR WHAT WAS GOING TO BE A DISCRETIONARY DEPOSITED THE RAINY DAY FUND. AND OTHER AND MAKING SURE THAT MORE RESERVES ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE THE ADMINISTRATION VIEW IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT RESERVE ACCOUNTS ARE SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE FOR THE DOWNTURN THAT MAY. THAT COULD COME AT ANY POINT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE UNDERSTOOD THAT. AND NEGOTIATE WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF THIS WAS THE VEHICLE WHERE. FLEXIBILITY MAKE TYPES. DISCRETIONARY DEPOSITS AND SO WE WERE ABLE WHAT THIS LANGUAGE. OKAY SO FIRST BILL PINE THAT SO WE'VE GOT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE BSA AND WE'VE GOT THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT THE V. D. S. A- AND AS IF THIS WASN'T CONFUSING ENOUGH FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS YOU KNOW THOSE ARE SO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO PICK A DIFFERENT NAME FOR THE PTSA. I HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT PROVISION OF THIS BILL BECAUSE AS I READ IT IT WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE INDEED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TAKE MONEY OUT OF THE MEDIA THE B. S. SAY THE DISCRETIONARY OVER FUNDING PSA AND MOVE IT INTO THE B. D. S. SAY AND THE REASON WHY I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS THAT THERE ARE SOME STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS BEFORE. WE CAN THE MONEY IN THE BSA THAT GOVERNOR HAS TO FIND A FISCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY. SO I WOULD SAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE BSA THERE ARE THAT MANDATORY IN THE DISCRETIONARY TO DEPOSITS. THE RULES FOR THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS ARE GOVERNED BY PROPOSITION DOING THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION SO. THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO CHANGE THOSE AND THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS ARE THE VAST MAJORITY. OF WHAT IS IN THE BSA. WHEN IT COMES TO DATE DISCRETIONARY DEPOSITS CERTAINLY IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION BACK. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO FILL UP THE MANDATORY SIDE TO ITS MAXIMUM OUT AND- CERTAINLY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY TENSION OF TOPPINGS OF THOSE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS ABSENT SOME TYPE OF. EMERGENCY SO FOR SPEAKING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION DON'T YOU SPELL AS CHANGING THAT PERSPECTIVE IN ANY AND THAT THAT THOSE PROVISIONS AND ANY SIGNIFICANT RESPECT BUT YOU UNDERSTAND MY CONCERN. THAT THOSE STATUTORY PROVISIONS WOULD NO LONGER EXIST IF WE MOVE THAT MONEY OUT OF THE DAY. YES CERTAINLY WELL. IN YOU'RE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE DISCRETIONARY MONEY YES. YES AND IT SAYS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IT'S IN THE BSA AS A DISCRETIONARY AMOUNT SO YOU KNOW IT IT IS SUBJECT. IT IS ONLY THE BSA'S AND YOU CREATION SO I THINK JUST NO PROPOSITION TWO WAS PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE ARE CERTAINLY TREATING ALL THOSE FUNDS MANDATORY AND DISCRETIONARY AS YOU KNOW FOR A SOME TYPE OF BUDGETARY. EMERGENCY BUT CERTAINLY IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO MOVE THE DISCRETIONARY. FUNDS TO ANY OTHER FINE DAD THERE WOULD BE. WE DIFFERENT. YES WELL I WOULD NEVER PROBLEM WITH IT IF THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS EXISTED ON THE PDSA BUT THEY DON'T AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE A PROBLEM. THANK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION COMMITTEE. SEEING THAT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. SINGLE PUBLIC COMING WE'RE GONNA GO TO AB ONE THIRTEEN SB ONE THIRTEEN. SO ONE THIRTEEN IS THE HOUSING TRAILER BILL AND TO SUBSTANTIVE ITEMS OF NOTE HERE THE FIRST IS WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSING PLANNING AND PRODUCTION GRANTS THAT WERE IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN BUDGET ACTS. THIS MAKES SOME TIMELINE CHANGES WITH REGARD TO NOTICE FINDINGS OF ANY VIOLENT ACTIONS AS WELL AS CLARIFYING THE REMEDIES AND HOW THEY RELATE TO THE PREVIOUS REMEDIES THAT WERE IN AB SEVENTY TWO AND AFTER A COUPLE YEARS AGO. AND ALSO ALLOWS COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS IN JURISDICTIONS TO ACCESS UP TO TWENTY FIVE AND THE FUNDS FOR THESE PLANNING PRODUCTION FRANCE EARLY FOR THEIR RENO TAKE CYCLE PLANNING. THE SECOND RELATES THE NATIONAL MORTGAGE SETTLEMENT FUNDING THIS PURSUANT TO RECENT COURT DECISION OF THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND IT IS. THIS IS THE INTENT EIGHT. TRUST. DO YOU. TO HELP WITH RENTER AND AS AS HOMEOWNERS PREVENTING FORECLOSURE. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR OBERNOLTE. SO I AM VERY HAPPY THAT WE'RE FINALLY IN MY OPINION APPROPRIATELY SPENDING THIS SETTLEMENT I MEAN IT'S BEEN YEARS AND YEARS OF LEGAL WRANGLING AND I THINK THAT THE STATE WAS IN THE WRONG THE END OF FIGHTING AGAINST SPENDING THIS MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE THE SETTLEMENT. PRESCRIBED READING THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT WHICH I'VE DONE I DON'T SEE ANY MENTION IN THERE. BEING USED FOR ASSISTING RENTERS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT. THAT THAT'S NOT A WORTHY CAUSE I'M JUST SAYING THAT WE'VE SPENT YEARS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LEGAL EXPENSES FIGHTING. USING THE FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE GIVEN TO US. WHY ARE WE WHY DO WE HAVE THIS LANGUAGE ABOUT. LEGAL AID FOR RENTERS IN HERE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO LIKE THAT FORMS TO. HE ARE. THE LANGUAGE OF THE SETTLEMENT AND I FEAR THAT WERE LEADING THE STATE OPEN TO LEGAL ACTION IF WE IF WE LEAVE THAT AND- SO I'LL MAKE A COUPLE COMMENTS AND THEN MAY TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FIRST IS ADMINISTRATION IS AWARE THAT. EVER WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT OF THE MERITS THE LAWSUIT IS OVER AND WE WANT TO FULLY COMPLY. WITH THAT DECISION. SECOND WHEN IT COMES SPECIFICALLY TO THIS PROPOSAL A WE WENT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S INSTRUCTIONS AT THAT POINT ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS WHEN THE MOMENT WAS CONCLUDED. AND MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER PROPOSAL WE PUT FORWARD IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THAT SO WHEN WE WENT BACK TO THAT SECTION. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF CONSIDERATIONS YOU KNOW IS A OR B. OR C. OR D. AND IT DIDN'T HAVE TO MEET ALL OF THEM YOU KNOW HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO SPEND THIS MONEY BUT- IT DOES HAVE TO MEET AT LEAST ONE OF THEM SO WHEN IT COMES TO THIS. SPECIFIC PROVISIONS I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME WITH REGARD TO HAVE BORROWER RELIEF. LEGAL. THAT THESE PROVISIONS. THAT STAND WE- SHARE YOUR CONCERN THAT WE WANT TO BE ON VERY FIRM. LEGAL GROUND IN WHATEVER IT THE LEGISLATURE INACTION THE GOVERNOR SIGNS ON THIS COME NEXT YEAR. OKAY WELL I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL HARRIS SHE THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL SHE WAS THE ONE WHO NET THAT SETTLEMENT CONCLUDED THAT SETTLEMENT AND PUT IN PLACE THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AT THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT WAS THAT THE SPENDING OF THE MONEY TO YOUR POINT HAS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AND SO WHILE I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC SECTION IN FRONT OF ME I CAN CONFIRM THAT WE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WERE VERY CAREFUL THAT THESE TWO PURPOSE STAYS. DISPEL ARE OUT WITH THE SENATE VERSION OKAY I'D BE INTERESTED IN HAVING A DISTRICT NOW OFF LINE ABOUT THAT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME WHATEVER DOCUMENTATION YOU HAVE THAT JUST TO ME LIKE THAT IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE FEDERAL SETTLEMENT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA FORTY PORTION OF IT BUT I'M HAVING SAID THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE THAT WERE ACTUALLY FINALLY TAKING THIS. THIS ACTION I'M JUST CONCERNED I WANT TO BE I DON'T WANT UP IN COURT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. TO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON AB ONE THIRTEEN SB ONE THIRTEEN. OKAY SIGNAL PUBLIC COMMON WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AB ONE FOURTEEN SB ONE FOURTEEN EDUCATION. SO THE NEXT BILL IS THE EDUCATION TRAILER BILL AND MAKES A NUMBER OF MOSTLY TECHNICAL CHANGES THE FIRST IS WITH REGARD TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT OF THREE POINT ONE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TO PERSON STIRS ON BEHALF OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS DAY THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THOSE PAYMENTS DO NOT COUNT FOR THE RICH ROUTINE RESTRICTING MAINTENANCE CALCULATION. THIS IS A CALCULATION RELATED TO THE SCHOOL FACILITIES BOND PROGRAMS AND THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS WOULD HAVE POLITICAL DISTRICTS OUT OF COMPLIANCE THE REQUIRED PAYMENTS RIGHT AT THIS FISCAL YEAR THIS MAKES THAT TECHNICAL CORRECTION ABLE. FORWARD AIR WITHOUT CREATING NEW RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH REGARD TO THE BOND PROGRAM THIS BILL ALSO DOES SOME FUNDING REQUIRED FUNDING SHIPS FOR PROP NINETY EIGHT SETTLE UP AS WELL AS ACCOUNT FOR ANY SHIFT IN FEDERAL FUNDS AND FINALLY ON A MORE SUBSTANTIVE LEVEL. TWO CHANGES IT BILL FIRST A DIVIDING THE FOR AT ANY ADOPTION ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM WE KNOW THAT THIS IS BEEN A SITE OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION AMONGST THE LEGISLATURE. INSTEAD THE MIX RATE CHANGE THIS FROM. THE STAFF IS THE COP WHINES WITH THE TOWARD ONE BY MOVING THAT DEADLINES AND SECOND CLARIFIES THAT THE CHILD SAVINGS ACCOUNTS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED THAT FUNDING IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TAX ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL CHILDREN. THINK ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THE THING NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY SEEING NONE WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO AB ONE FIFTEEN AS PEOPLE FIFTEEN WHICH IS GOING TO BE DISCUSSING THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX. SO AB SB ONE FIFTEEN IS THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION TAX ALSO KNOWN AS THE NCO TAX AS MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE KNOW THE CURRENT VERSION OF THIS TAX EXPIRED ON JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS AUTHORIZED A NEW TAX BEGINNING JULY FIRST OF THE FIRST DAY OF THIS FISCAL YEAR SO LONG AS OUR PAPERWORK IS SUBMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE END OF THIS MONTH. THAT TAX NEW TAX CAN BE RETROACTIVE TO JULY FIRST SO THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY GAP THIS TAX IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN DESIGN COMPARED TO THE- TAX THAT CAME BEFORE IT OVERALL IT WOULD RAISE I WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT REVENUE IMPACT POSITIVE TO THE GUY. ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR YOUR LAST FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND IN THE LAST AT FISCAL YEAR IT'S A HALF YEAR BUT AN ANNUALIZED BASIS WOULD RATE. I WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT OF TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IT'S BASED ON A CUMULATIVE ENROLLMENT BASED ON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN YEAR AND WHAT IF I DON'T PLANS REGULATED BY. DMB T. AS WELL AS A CAL CONTRACTS. DCS AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER BROOKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THIS WHICH IS TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL. BUT THE WAY THAT I'M READING IT THEY'LL ALSO CREATED UNREIMBURSED TAX BURDEN OF DEPENDING DEPENDING ON WHAT FIGURES USE BETWEEN SIXTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR THAT WILL BE PAID BY. ENROLLEES IN PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS OTHER THAN THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING T TAX AND I PERSONALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS UNDERSTANDING THAT RIGHT AND THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN A WHY WHY DID THAT OCCURRED WORK WE DO ABOUT IT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT. CHECK A ONE APARTMENT FINANCE SO YOU ARE CORRECT THERE WILL BE A TAX LIABILITY FOR HEALTH PLANS ON THE COMMERCIAL LIVES. IN FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THAT IS APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. HIGH VERY HIGH LEVEL. IN DESIGNING THIS TAX. YOU HAVE TO ME TO FEDERAL TESTS ONE OF WHICH IS TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO HOLD HARMLESS FOR ALL OF THE- MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WE TRIED. WITH THE- TAX LIABILITY FOR THESE PLANS ON THEIR COMMERCIALIZED BUT BECAUSE WE COULD NOT. MAKE THE TAX ZERO FOR THOSE SPECIFIC LIVES THERE ARE SOME INSTANCES WHERE THESE PLANS WILL HAVE. SOME TAX LIABILITY. AFTER THEY'VE BEEN REIMBURSED WITH THEIR FEDERAL FUNDS IN THEIR MANAGED CARE CAPITATION RATES. SO WE HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM. SEVERAL YEARS AGO WHEN WE AUTHORIZED THE MCO TAX AND THE WAY THAT WE SOLVED IT DOWN WAS WE CHANGED. OUR CORPORATE TAX CODE IN THE STATE. TO CREATE AN OFFSETTING YOU KNOW ROUGHLY OFFSETTING. A FINANCIAL BENEFIT FOR THE COMPANY IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY AND PREVENT THOSE COSTS FROM BEING PASSED ON TO THEIR RATE PAYERS WHY HAVE WE NOT DONE THAT THIS TIME. IN TERMS OF THE COMPLEXITY COMPARATIVELY LAST MCO TEXAS MCO TAX ONLY HAS TWO TAXING TEARS. OF THE SIXTEEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IS A TAX LIABILITY FOR THOSE PLANS BUT IN TERMS OF THE- ACTUAL IMPACT ON BENEFICIARIES WE ESTIMATE THAT THAT WOULD BE ABOUT A FIVE TO. TEN CENT. INCREASE ON THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUMS. AND SO I THINK WE'VE MINIMIZE THAT TAX LIABILITY TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE USING THE NCO STRUCTURE AND I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY ADDITIONAL TAX CONFORMITY CHANGES THAT WERE INCLUDING THE LAST. PROPOSAL SURE I UNDERSTAND I JUST MY POINT IS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR US TO DO SOMETHING CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE MCO TAX THE SAME WAY WE DID LAST TIME WE AUTHORIZED. IN AN EFFORT TO HOLD. TOLD RATE PAYERS HARMLESS AND I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT WE DIDN'T DO THAT. GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER. COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THINK THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR SPENDING SEVERAL MONTHS WITH US IN DISCUSSION OVER THE RESTRUCTURING OF THE MCO TAX WE'VE LANDED IN A GOOD PLACE WE DO SUPPORT THE MODEL THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE TO BUDGET TRAILER BILLS WE ARE SEEKING ASSURANCES THAT DURING THE WAIVER PROCESS IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS REQUIRING OF THE STATE TO THE TAX. THAT THOSE CHANGES BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR CONSIDERATION AND REVIEW. THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE AND CHECK WITH HEALTH THAT WE TOO ARE IN SUPPORT WE THINK THIS TAXES LANDED IN A REALLY GOOD SPOT HAVING BEEN THROUGH. FOR THESE NOW WE'RE SUPPORT WITH THE TAX THANK YOU. BECAUSE THE PART OF A BLUE SHIELD OF CALIFORNIA WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE CURRENT STRUCTURE OF THE TAX THANK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT OF THE TAX WE APPRECIATE. THE PLANS AND THE ADMINISTRATION. CONVERSATIONS IN GETTING TO AN AGREED OF TAX STRUCTURE THAT BRINGS OUT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS THANKS. CHAIR MEMBERS CUT THE MOST WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS A CALIFORNIA WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MCO STRUCTURE IN THIS BILL IT'S CRITICAL DOLLARS FOR THE APARTMENT LEGISLATURE ALL ENGAGING ON THIS DISCUSSION. THANK. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILLMOVE ON TO AB ONE EIGHTEEN. SB ONE EIGHTEEN WHICH- I BELIEVE COVERS. THE AGREEMENT THE COVERS THE- AND WERE USED FOR THIRTEEN DIFFERENT BARGAINING UNITS. SO AB ONE EIGHTEEN COVERS CONTRACTS OF BARGAINING UNITS. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SEVEN ELEVEN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY ONE SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS FOR YOUR CONSIDERABLE CONSIDERATION FOR RATIFICATION IN THIS TRAILER BILL. THE CURRENT YOUR **** ACOSTA THESE CONTRACTS IS FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND WHEN YOU TAKE OFF FUNDS INTO ACCOUNT IT'S ONE HUNDRED FORTY TWO POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND TO CLARIFY IN THIS IS FOR RATIFICATION BY THE LEGISLATURE BUT OF COURSE. THE FUNDS MUST BE ACTUALLY OPERATED BY THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE PART OF EMPLOYEES FOR RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND WHEN IT COMES TO ANY SPECIFICS AT SOME COLLEAGUES HERE FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. GREAT THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THIS CERTAINLY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO A FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO COMMEND YOU OUT I KNOW IT'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK TO GO SHOOTING ZAMIL USE AND IN GENERAL I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE DONE AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH THEM I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IN AUSTIN MOST GENERAL ONE FIRST WHICH IS THAT. IN ORDER TO THESE COMPENSATION STUDIES TIME THESE MO USE GO UP FOR NEGOTIATION AND IN SOME CASES THE COMPENSATION STUDY WILL IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE STATE EMPLOYEES ARE UNDER COMPENSATED EITHER WHAT OTHERS IT'LL IDENTIFIER IS WHETHER OVER COMPENSATED BUT A NUMBER OF THE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT IDENTIFIED AS BEING OVER COMPENSATED IN THE STUDIES THIS TIME AROUND ENDED UP GETTING EXACTLY THE SAME SPREE JUDGMENTS AS EVERYONE ELSE INSIDE THAT BEGS THE QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE COMPENSATION STUDIES IF WE'RE GOING TO IGNORE WHAT THE CONCEIT CONCERT STUDY TELLING SO I KNOW YOU BUT YOU WERE A LOT CLOSER TO THE NEGOTIATIONS AND WE WERE I WONDER. IF YOU COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON. ON WHY THOSE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN. COMPENSATION STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO EXISTING STATUTE. BUT AS YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS IS A VERY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. AND WHILE THERE ARE CLASSIFICATIONS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS UNDERPAID IN THOSE COMPENSATION STUDIES. THROUGH THE VARIOUS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SESSIONS THAT WE HAVE. IN THE PRIORITIES THAT THE BARGAINING UNIT WANTS TO ADDRESS AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION WE ALTERNATELY LAND ON CERTAIN CLASSIFICATIONS RECEIVING CERTAIN. ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHERS NOT SO IT'S A MATTER OF. ALIGNING THOSE PRIORITIZATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE BARGAINING UNIT. WHICH MAY NOT ALWAYS COINCIDE. COMPENSATION SURVEYS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY KELLY CHARM. THAT'S WHAT I EXPECTED IN NEW YORK BUT- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE POLITICAL AND BARGAINING REALITIES THAT YOU'RE FACING YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD CONCERNED. FOR JUST A SMALL FRACTION OF THE BARGAINING UNITS THE SPECIAL SALARY ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE PART OF THE NEW AMMO USE AS WELL AS- I BELIEVE FOR SOME OF THE EMPLOYEES THERE'S A TWO HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS A MONTH. HEALTH INSURANCE COMPENSATION AUGMENTATION THAT'S TAKING PLACE I WONDERED IF YOU COULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO AND- YOU'RE THINKING ON THOSE. THANK YOU IN TERMS OF THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLAR A MONTH STIPEND FOR THE HEALTH CARE IT'S EALLY TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY IN THE ACCESSIBILITY OF. HEALTH INSURANCE IN THE PLANS THAT THOSE MEMBERS ARE FACED WITH SO BASED ON THE RATES THAT CALPERS ADOPTS FOR THE VARIOUS HEALTH PLANS THAT STATE EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS TO. THIS STIPEND ESSENTIALLY IS TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THERE ARE REAL IMPACTS TO OUR EMPLOYEES. BASED ON THE RATES AND THE INCREASES THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE YEAR OVER YEAR FOR HEALTH PLANS AND SO THIS. MODEL OR THIS PROPOSAL REALLY IS TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY IN THE IMPACT OF THAT THOSE HEALTH CARE PREMIUM INCREASES THAT ARE THAT THOSE MEMBERS SEE ON A MONTHLY BASIS. ONCE THOSE RATES ARE ADOPTED AND SO IT'S AN ATTEMPT TO RIGHT SIZE AND OFFSET SOME OF THE INCREASED COST THAT THE EMPLOYEES SEE AS A RESULT OF. WHAT CALPERS BOARD ULTIMATELY ADOPTS FOR THOSE RATES IN THOSE PLANS OKAY BUT THESE ARE THESE RATES HAVE GONE UP FOR ALL OF THE PERS PLANS RIGHT SO IT IS JUST A SMALL. FRACTION OF THE BARGAINING UNITS THAT WERE ARE TING. OPPOSITION TO REACH ONE OF FOR EVERYBODY SO I JUST GOT MY ATTENTION WHY THOSE BARGAINING UNITS AND NOT THE OTHERS. WELL SOME OF THE BARGAINING UNITS AGAIN IT COMES DOWN A PRIORITIZATION OF WHAT THOSE BARGAINING UNITS WANT TO NEGOTIATE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE MEMBERS AND THOSE PRIORITIES BUT IT ALSO COMES DOWN TO TIMING IN TERMS OF. WHEN THOSE DEALS WERE NEGOTIATED IN RELATION TO WIN CALPERS ADOPTED THE RATES IN JUNE SO DEPENDING ON WHERE WE WERE AT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS WHEN THE RATES WERE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED AND THEN WHERE AND WE ULTIMATELY. CAME TO A RESOLUTION AND THAT TENTATIVE AGREEMENT FOR THOSE GROUPS THOSE ALL FACTORED INTO PLACE TO WHY SOME DID HAVE THE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY A MONTH STIPEND VERSUS THOSE THAT DID NOT. THAT'S A LITTLE MORE CLEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISSED MESSAGES.
