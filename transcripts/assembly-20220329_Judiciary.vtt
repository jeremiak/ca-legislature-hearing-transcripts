THAT THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM

00:31:47.605 --> 00:31:49.774
HERE LET'S LOOK AT IT. OF A

00:31:49.841 --> 00:31:51.476
COUPLE YEARS LATER THIS ISSUE

00:31:51.542 --> 00:31:53.444
ERUPTED NATIONALLY THERE WAS AN

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:54.579
OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL

00:31:54.646 --> 00:31:56.481
REPORT THERE WAS- SENATE

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:57.515
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS AND THEN

00:31:57.582 --> 00:31:59.951
THIS. BIG NATIONAL CAMPAIGN THAT

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:01.986
WAS ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO GET

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:03.755
PROVIDERS TO VOLUNTARILY REDUCE

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:06.491
THEIR USE. OF PSYCHOTROPIC DRUGS

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:08.259
IN NURSING HOMES. AND FOR THE

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:09.827
MOST PART THERE WAS SOME SUCCESS

00:32:09.894 --> 00:32:11.796
WE THE RATES WENT DOWN A YEAR

00:32:11.863 --> 00:32:14.699
AFTER YEAR GRADUALLY. TILL ABOUT

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:15.466
TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN OR

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:16.968
SEVENTEEN AND THEN THE MOMENTUM

00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:18.870
OF THE CAMPAIGN REALLY. STARTED

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:20.772
TO EXHAUST ITSELF AND THE RATES

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:22.106
FLATTENED AND SINCE THEN THEY'VE

00:32:22.173 --> 00:32:24.342
COME BACK UP ESPECIALLY. DURING

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:26.210
THE PANDEMIC AND IT'S BEEN-

00:32:26.277 --> 00:32:27.478
PRETTY DISPIRITING TO BE HONEST

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:30.782
WITH YOU. SO THE TIME HAS COME-

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.984
TO DO WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE

00:32:33.051 --> 00:32:34.018

WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT LAW.

00:32:35.053 --> 00:32:36.521
THE SECOND CONCEPT I WANT TO

00:32:36.587 --> 00:32:38.189
TALK ABOUT JUST VERY BRIEFLY IS

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.257
THAT INFORMED CONSENT FOR THE

00:32:39.324 --> 00:32:41.092
MOST PART IN NURSING HOMES HAS

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:44.462
BEEN A SHAM. PROCESS RESIDENTS

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:46.297

ALL ABOUT THESE DRUGS IT USUALLY

00:32:47.932 --> 00:32:48.733
JUST. BITS AND PIECES OF

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.102
INFORMATION IT'S NOT A VERY

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.669
COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATION

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.304
THEY'RE HAVING WITH THEIR

00:32:53.371 --> 00:32:54.205

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.843
NOW. I'VE BEEN I'VE SPENT A FAIR

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:00.144
AMOUNT OF TIME AND FACILITIES

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:01.312

00:33:01.379 --> 00:33:03.614
ROMS AND I HAVE YET. TO EVER

00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.450

00:33:10.722 --> 00:33:12.123
A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.991
RESIDENTS ARE GETTING- THAT I'M

00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:15.760
NOT REALLY THIS BILL IS NOT

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:16.961
REALLY FOCUSED THE CONVERSATION

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.162
THE PRESCRIBER SHOULD BE HAVING

00:33:18.229 --> 00:33:19.364
WITH THEIR PATIENTS ABOUT THE

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:21.165

I'M HERE THAT I'VE SEEN

00:34:02.407 --> 00:34:04.509

TAKE CARE OF THEM YOU MAKE MORE

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:20.825
MONEY AND AT THE SAME TIME YOU

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:22.960
SHOT THE COST OF THE PRODUCT ON

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:24.729
BECAUSE THE TAXPAYERS BECAUSE

DIFFICULTY ARE. IT NEEDS OF THE

00:34:36.607 --> 00:34:38.042
FIRST PLACE. CAN YOU MAKE IT

00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:40.545
EVEN HARDER FOR THEM AND YOU EE

00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:42.580
PEOPLE DYING OF DEHYDRATION. AND

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:45.316
YOU ALSO SEE PEOPLE DYING OF A

00:34:45.383 --> 00:34:47.385

TAP YOUR WILL TO LIVE AND SO

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.189

THAT IT DOUBLES YOUR MORTALITY

00:34:52.523 --> 00:34:54.192
RATE. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:56.794
KOPPEL REASONS THAT GO INTO IT

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.162

00:35:01.899 --> 00:35:03.401
DETRIMENTAL AFFECT. YEAH I TELL

TREATING THE DEMENTIA OR HELPING

00:35:19.383 --> 00:35:21.652

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:52.216
DRUGS ARE NOT A TREATMENT FOR

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:53.851

GOOD DISCUSSIONS- AND I DO

BELIEVE THAT WE'RE WORKING

CHRIS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:39:13.918 --> 00:39:15.820
I THINK WE JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:17.154
SURE THAT THE PROCESS IS THAT WE

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:20.024
PUT IN PLACE- DON'T DETER OUR

00:39:20.091 --> 00:39:21.192
PRESCRIBERS ARE PHYSICIANS THAT

00:39:21.258 --> 00:39:23.427
WORK WITH OUR PATIENTS- DON'T TO

00:39:23.494 --> 00:39:24.895
TURN THEM FROM WANTING TO USE

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.897
THAT PROCESS AND MAKING SURE

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:27.965
THAT OUR PATIENTS ALSO HAVE

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:29.800
ACCESS TO PSYCHOTROPIC ANTI

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:31.969
PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS NGUYEN ON

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:34.138
HOPEFULLY MANY RARE OCCASIONS

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:36.307
THAT THEY NEED THEM AND SO- THE

00:39:36.373 --> 00:39:37.842
DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'RE HAVING-

00:39:37.908 --> 00:39:39.477
REALLY REVOLVE AROUND KIND OF

00:39:39.543 --> 00:39:41.145
THREE DIFFERENT POINTS. ONE

00:39:41.212 --> 00:39:42.146
MAKING SURE THAT THE INFORMED

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:44.381
CONSENT OF PRIDE OF BRITAIN

00:39:44.448 --> 00:39:46.717
INFORMED CONSENT IS OF IS A FORM

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.152
SOMETHING THAT BOTH THE FACILITY

00:39:48.219 --> 00:39:50.054
AND THAT AND THE PRESCRIBER CAN

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.455
BE COMPLIANT WITH THAT WE'RE

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:52.757
CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO

00:39:52.823 --> 00:39:54.759
PROVIDE AND THERE'S NOT A GREAT

00:39:54.825 --> 00:39:56.026
AREA WITH RESPECT TO WHAT THAT

00:39:56.093 --> 00:39:57.762
IS I'M BECAUSE IF YOU COUPLE

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:00.464
THAT WITH BOTH I'M WHAT THE BILL

00:40:00.531 --> 00:40:03.734
DOES IS IT PUTS IN PLACE. MORE

00:40:03.801 --> 00:40:05.870
CIVIL LIABILITIES AND CITATIONS

00:40:05.936 --> 00:40:08.139
WITH RESPECT TO THIS- WE WANT TO

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.840
MAKE SURE THAT BOTH- OUR

00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:10.674
PRESCRIBERS AND OUR FACILITIES

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.676
CAN BE CLEARLY COMPLIANT- IF

00:40:12.743 --> 00:40:15.146
THEY WANT TO BE- AND SO LAST I

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:17.014
WOULD JUST SAY THAT AND THERE

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:18.015
HAVE BEEN SOME REALLY GOOD

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:20.818
INITIATIVES AND AT BACK IN

00:40:20.885 --> 00:40:22.219
TWENTY TWELVE AND THERE WAS A- A

00:40:22.286 --> 00:40:23.854
FAIR AMOUNT OF A COLLABORATIVE

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.023
APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT WE

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.158
REDUCED AS THE USE OF ANTI

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.493
PSYCHOTICS IN NURSING FACILITIES

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.329
AND SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.899
BEEN A 50% REDUCTION IN THE USE

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:36.433
OF AN ASSET HI. ANDERSON HOME-

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.768

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:39.970
HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.772
DOWNTURN IN THAT- AND WE OF LOOKING AT WAYS

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.874
THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. ADDRESS

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:45.743
THE SITUATION- BUT WE HAVE BEEN

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:46.744
TALKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:47.978

COLLABORATIVE APPROACH RELATED

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:52.283
TO EDUCATION AND TRAINING- AND

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:54.018
KIND OF COMING OUT THIS IN BOTH.

00:40:54.084 --> 00:40:55.853
NOT JUST A PUNITIVE APPROACH BUT

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:57.288
ALSO IN A VERY POSITIVE

00:40:57.354 --> 00:40:58.856
APPROACH- AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:00.124

FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE FACILITY

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:08.292

SOMETHING CAN BE WORKED OUT SO

00:42:18.769 --> 00:42:20.671
THAT IT'S VERY CLEAR. WHEN IT'S

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.373
BEING USED OR NOT BEING USED BUT

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:24.341

GET AWAY FROM. THIS NOTION OF%

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.445
INSTITUTIONS WHICH IS SORT OF

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.880
NATURAL FOR THEM TO DO TO WANT

00:42:29.947 --> 00:42:31.715

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:32.917

THE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CARE

00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.623

AWARENESS. AND IF THERE ARE

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.738
COLLABORATIVE WAYS TO DO IT

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.974
BETTER OKAY FINE BITES THAT'S

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:41.278
IT'S- OBVIOUSLY VERY DIFFICULT

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:43.013
TO MANAGE THAT WITHIN A NORMAL.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.615
COURT CASE- THE ISSUES WATER

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.751
CASES PRESENT TEND TO BE VERY

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.486
TECHNICAL. SO YOU HAVE HUNDREDS

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:51.254
OF PARTIES AND THEN YOU LAY ON

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:54.091
TOP OF THAT- REALLY COMPETING

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:56.259
EXPERTS DEBATING ALL SORTS OF-

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:57.561
TECHNICAL THINGS SUCH AS HOW

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:59.463
MUCH WATER PERCOLATES INTO A

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:01.031
GROUNDWATER BASIN ON AVERAGE.

00:50:01.098 --> 00:50:03.100
AND HOW MUCH- EXTRACTION OCCURS

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:04.701
IT'S NOT SIMPLE TO CALCULATE

00:50:04.768 --> 00:50:06.703
THOSE THINGS SO THE JUDGE HAS TO

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:08.338
MANAGE LARGE NUMBERS OF EXPERTS

00:50:08.405 --> 00:50:10.307
AS WELL IN MANY OF THESE CASES.

00:50:10.374 --> 00:50:11.675
AND THEN AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:14.077
INDICATED. MANY OF THESE CASES

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:15.545
ARE VERY DOCUMENT HEAVY IF YOU

00:50:15.612 --> 00:50:17.581
CAN IMAGINE- LITIGATION

00:50:17.647 --> 00:50:19.583
INVOLVING HUNDREDS OF LANDOWNERS

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:21.918
HAVING TO PROVE UP- HOW MUCH

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:22.719
GROUND WATER THEY MAY HAVE

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:24.554
PUMPED OVER TIME. VERY DOCUMENT

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:26.523
HEAVY- AS THE BAY DELTA

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:27.724
LITIGATION AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.559
BLOOM INDICATED THAT DIDN'T

00:50:29.626 --> 00:50:31.128
INVOLVE WITNESSES BUT IT HAD TO

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.429
INVOLVE THE STATE WATER

00:50:32.496 --> 00:50:33.363
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.198
PROCEEDING. THAT HAD LASTED FOR

00:50:35.265 --> 00:50:37.567
YEARS AND SO YOU HAD TENS TO

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.602
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:50:38.668 --> 00:50:39.970
DOCUMENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:50:40.036 --> 00:50:41.938
RECORD ALL OF THIS MAKES IT

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:42.739
DIFFICULT FOR SUPERIOR COURT

00:50:42.806 --> 00:50:45.008
JUDGE TO HANDLE ON A NORMAL

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:46.410
DOCKET SO. THE CONCEPT OF THE

00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.545
STATE HAVING A PROGRAM TO UNDER

00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:52.048
WHICH JUDGES CAN BE TRAINED AS

00:50:52.115 --> 00:50:53.617
TO WHAT ISSUES ARISE AND HOW TO

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:55.585
HANDLE THEM IN THE KINDS OF

00:50:55.652 --> 00:50:56.653
CASES IS A VERY GOOD IDEA. THEN

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:57.788
THOSE JUDGES THE JUDICIAL

00:50:57.854 --> 00:50:58.688
COUNCIL HAVING THE ABILITY TO

00:50:58.755 --> 00:51:01.425
ASSIGN CASES TO JUDGES WHO HAVE

00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:03.827
THAT TRAINING- SHOULD. OF THOSE

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.729
JUDGES PROCESS THESE CASES AS

00:51:05.796 --> 00:51:08.064
THEY MOVE FORWARD- AND THEN

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:09.699
FINALLY THE STATE PROVIDING SOME

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:13.036
SUPPORT. FOR EXPERT ASSISTANCE

00:51:13.103 --> 00:51:14.237
IN THESE CASES ALSO MAKES VERY

00:51:14.304 --> 00:51:15.639
GOOD SENSE AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.974
