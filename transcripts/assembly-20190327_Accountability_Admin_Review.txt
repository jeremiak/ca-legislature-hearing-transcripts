IT. MINISTER TO REVIEW HEARING TO ORDER AT THIS POINT. AND WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM THAT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF AUTHORS HERE SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN AS A SUB COMMITTEE. OKAY I'M AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA START WITH MR COOLEY MORNING. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES -- IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TO PRESENT AB. THREE TWELVE AND I VIEW THIS BILL AS IT'S ACTUALLY SORT OF THING THAT I THINK MOST OF OUR CONSTITUENTS WOULD LIKE US TO DO GENERALLY. TO ENCOURAGE THAT WE REMAIN A A STATE. OF LAW GOVERNED BY LAW. AND THAT SOMEBODY IS PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CURRENT APPLICABILITY OF THAT LAW. TO ENSURE THAT IF THERE'S YOU KNOW OUR BASIC SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT AS WE ADOPT STATUTES. WE CAN FOR AUTHORITY TO AGENCIES TO ADOPT REGULATIONS AND THEY HAVE DONE THAT THERE'S PROBABLY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THOUSAND PAGES OF REGULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS BILL SIMPLY SAYS. THAT ALL AGENCIES A STATE GOVERNMENT SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR REGULATIONS. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE STILL. UP [inaudible] CURRENT. NOT CONFLICT WITH OTHER BODIES OF LAW. REMAIN AFTER THEIR INTENDED PURPOSE. IT'S REALLY DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE OUR LAW IS A LIVING THING NOT A DEAD THING AND THAT THE RULES THAT ARE OUT THERE. GUIDING. OUR ECONOMY OUR CURRENT -- I GO IN THIS BACKGROUND A LITTLE BIT I ACTUALLY DO THINK THAT THIS JUST FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND GOOD GOVERNMENT IT IS AN IDEA THE REPEAL OF MOST CALIFORNIANS. ARM. FROM A VERY PERSONAL STANDPOINT MY WIFE WHO WORKS AS A CHURCH BOOKKEEPER. HAD AN AGENCY OF STATE GOVERNMENT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SEND THE LETTER TELLING THEM THAT THEY HAD TO REDO THEIR CHURCH BYLAWS. TO CONFORM BOARD OF EQUALIZATION RULES. AND MY WIFE JUST BECAUSE OF OUR CONGREGATION WADE WE DO THESE RULES IS CUMBERSOME. CHECK CAN YOU DOCUMENT FOR ME WHY THIS IS REQUIRED. THIS LED TO A TWO YEAR LONG HIATUS. AS A USER INTERNAL COUNSEL OUTSIDE COUNSEL CAME BACK AND SAID WELL ACTUALLY WE'VE BEEN ASKING PEOPLE THAT FOR YEARS WE HAVE NO AUTHORITY. FOR SO THIS IDEA THAT WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS A STATE OF LAWS KEEP THE LAWS CURRENT KEEP THEM TIED THIS STATUTE. IT'S WHAT'S BEHIND THIS BILL IT WOULD REQUIRE A ONE TIME GOING TO THOROUGHLY. IT WOULD INCLUDE A PUBLIC HEARING SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE CANDIDATES REGULATIONS AT THE THE QUESTION. THEY COULD SAY THAT IN A PUBLIC HEARING AND TRY TO GET IT IN THE QUEUE FOR EXAMINATION. THE OTHER THING TO KNOW ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL. IS THAT IN. TWENTY ELEVEN WHEN DARRYL STEINBERG WAS TO PRO TIM IN THE SENATE. THE SENATE DEMOCRATS CONDUCTED THEIR POLICY RETREAT IN FEBRUARY OF THAT YEAR. AND CAME AWAY AND THIS WAS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THE SENATE DEMOCRATS AND TWENTY ELEVEN FOR VARIETY REASONS THAT YOU'RE DO WITH THE BUDGET THE IDEA DID DOCKET ADOPTED SO I'VE KIND OF KEPT MOVING FORWARD. SO -- ANYWAY THAT'S THE BACK DROP ON THIS THE IT WOULD REQUIRE AS I SAY THIS REVIEW TO BE CONDUCTED. I THINK IT IS GOOD GOVERNMENT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING REPEAL EVERYONE AS SOUND. I ALSO FEEL. YOU KNOW THERE ARE QUESTIONS NOW WHERE THE ECONOMY'S GOING WELL WE SOMEDAY HAVE RECESSION WHAT WILL HAPPEN. WE WE HAVE SENIORS THAT NEED TO GET THE WORK FORCE THEY NEED JOBS ARE AVAILABLE HAVE YOUNG COLLEGE GRADUATES NEED TO GET THE WORK FORCE. THEY NEED JOBS AVAILABLE. ARE TO ENSURE THAT OUR REGULATORY SYSTEM IS WELL ADAPTED TO THAT NEED AND AND TIED BOTH THE LAW AND NOT IN CONFLICT. REALLY SUPPORTS THAT ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE SEEKING JOBS RELY UPON. SO I FEEL THIS IS A ONE SMALL STEP THAT ACTUALLY IS. IS VERY SIGNIFICANT I HAVE WITH ME A REPRESENT OF THE STATE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SUPPORT. PAUL ASKED ROBERT MUTRIE TO SPEAK. THANK YOU. JUST TO BE CLEAR COULD TO MUTUAL ROBERT MUTRIE FOR THE CAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE VIEW IT AS A SINCERE SPRING CLEANING THAT'S BEEN TWENTY YEARS DELAYED RIGHT AND WHEN YOU DON'T CLEAN IT OUT. BECAUSE ITGETS MESSY THERE'S THINGS IN THERE YOU DON'T WANT ANYMORE AND IT'S HARD TO USE. AT A BASIC LEVEL WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HOPES FOR IS THAT THROUGH MEASURES LIKE THIS. THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT GETS TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS -- EASIER TO WORK THROUGH YOU KNOW THE IT HAS TO BE THERE OF COURSE BUT WE NEED SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH CLEANLY -- AND ONE POINT WHICH I'D LIKE TO ADD AS THEY BELIEVE THIS WILL ALSO BE GOOD FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID THIS IN TWENTY ELEVEN UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AND SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IT SAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THIRTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS SO I I THINK THIS IS A WIN WIN ON ALL SIDES REALLY -- FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND THE STATE AND SO WE ARE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A QUORUM SO. YES WE DO NOW HAVE A QUORUM. AT THIRTY LIKE TO TAKE THE ROLE PETRIE-NORRIS. PETRIE-NORRIS PRESENT. PATTERSON [inaudible] BURKE [inaudible] LACKING. MEDINA. MEDINA PRESENT QUIRK SILVA. X. OF A PRESENCE SMITH. SMITH PRESIDENT. GREAT THANK YOU. I'M MISTER COOLEY TO HAVE AT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NOT SURE THE REFERENCES IN AND MARK IN THE RANKS TODAY SCENE NINE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. AND CHAIR MEMBERS MICHAEL YOUNG WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION -- WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL -- AWHILE WHEN ITS BASE IT SOUNDS REASONABLE WE BELIEVE THAT -- THIS BILL WOULD DIVERT LIMITED RESOURCES FROM STATE AGENCIES FROM PERFORMING THEIR CORE MISSION TO WORK THAT THE OIL IS ALREADY DOING -- THE OILS RT TASKED WITH REVIEWING A NEW RACE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE -- NECESSARY CLEARED NINE DUPLICATIVE AND LEGALLY VALID THEY WORK IN COORDINATION WITH THE STATE AGENCIES TO TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEW RAKE SO AGAINST REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO REDO THIS WORK OR TO DUPLICATE THOSE EFFORTS THAT ARE ALREADY BEING DONE -- IT'S UNNECESSARY SO FOR INSTANCE YOU HAVE THE LABOR AGENCY INSTEAD OF ENFORCING ISSUES LIKE WAGE THEREFORE WORKER SAFETY PROTECTIONS OR WORKPLACE IMMIGRATION RIGHTS WERE -- OUR FOR OUR VULNERABLE WORKERS THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE STAFF MONEY AND RESOURCES TO DO THE WORK AGAIN AT THE YELLS ARGUMENT HAS TO DO -- AND I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT PRESENTLY TO GET REGULATIONS PASSED THERE'S A ROBUST A QUARTER PROCESS THAT INCLUDES -- EMPLOYERS THAT INCLUDES WORKERS THAT INCLUDES ADVOCATES THAT INCLUDES THE COMMUNITY AND THE REGULATORS IN ORDER TO INSURE THAT THESE REGULATIONS ARE -- ARE APPROPRIATE NECESSARY AND AND PASSED IN A QUICK MANNER BUT IT'S NOT QUICK IT'S DIFFICULT AND ONE OF THE NUMBER ONE ARGUMENT THAT YOU HEAR FROM. BUSINESSES WITH A YEAR FROM EMPLOYERS BUT WE TRY AND PASS NEW PARTICULAR WORKER SAFETY REGULATIONS IS THAT THE REAGAN UNNECESSARY -- SO WE PASS -- HE STAND INDOOR HE STANDARDS OR OTHER ISSUE THAT THE WORKPLACE THE NUMBER ONE ARGUMENT IS THAT THESE BAGS ARE UNNECESSARY SO IT'S A REQUIRE -- SIR TO ROUTE IT'S REQUIRED IT'S IT'S TO SET UP A SCENARIO WHERE YOU HAVE TO RE LITIGATE THIS ISSUE OR RE ARGUE THIS ISSUE FOR EVERY SINGLE WORKER SAFETY RAY HAVE TO RE PROVE. THAT REGULATION IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF A SERIOUS HARM TO WORKER SAFETY A SO AGAIN BECAUSE THE OIL DOES THIS WORK IN BECAUSE IT'S SO STREAMY WITH TO GIVE YOU DIRECT PATH ALREADY -- AND THE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO WORKERS ANSWER CONSUMERS INTO THE PUBLIC WE ARE OPPOSED. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CURRENT PLAYING WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE -- WE'RE ALIGNED HERE WITH OUR OPPOSITION -- WE OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THREE PRIMARY REASONS SAME REASONS HERE FIRST EXISTING LAW ARE YOU ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE THROUGH -- A. L. AS JUST MEANT MICHAEL JUST MENTIONED HERE -- REVIEWED THE YET -- A. L. REVIEWS PROPOSED REGULATIONS FOR NECESSITY AUTHORITY. CLARITY CONSISTENCY REFERENCE AND NON DUPLICATION SO IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING SECONDLY WE CONTEND THAT REGULATIONS ARE PROTECTIONS. WHICH SAFEGUARD HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- AND LASTLY UNDER AB THREE TWELVE AGENCIES WILL SPEND TIME AND RESOURCES ON A DUPLICATIVE. OF BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS INSTEAD OF PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS -- ACCORDINGLY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON A. B.. THREE TWELVE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MATT BROUGHT HERE ON BEHALF THE TEAMSTERS IN OPPOSITION THEY GIVE. SEEING NO OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION ARE THERE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MISTER MEDINA. MISSION TO THE AUTHOR -- MR COOLEY THE THE THE BILL'S INTENT AND WHAT IT DOES. IS TO LOOK AT A DUPLICATIVE REGULATIONS AND AND AND AND AND IT IT WOULDN'T BE AN ATTEMPT -- TO HAVE TO ARGUE. THE EXISTING REGULATIONS EXACTLY I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY LABOR COLLEAGUES THEY'RE WRONG ON THE LAW. THEY HAVEN'T ACTUALLY LOOKED AT EVEN THE SIZE OF THE OIL AGENCY IN ITS MISSION. ALWAYS A L. EXIST TO REVIEW NEW REGULATIONS. THEY DO NOT. RUN A NET ON EXISTING REGULATIONS FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS OUT THAT IS NOT IN THE MISSION OF OIL THERE'S NO ASPECT A LOYAL THE TOUCHES. THIS PIECE NOR DOES THIS BILL AND I THINK IF YOUR QUESTION. ADDRESS ANY REQUIREMENT JUSTIFICATION FOR EXISTING RAGS ALREADY IN PLACE FURTHER IN A PUBLIC PURPOSE IT'S VERY SPECIFIC DUPLICATIVE OVERLAPPING. INCONSISTENT -- OUT OF DATE. SO YOU'RE REALLY LOOKING AT SOMETHING HAS CHANGED. IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE REGULATION OPERATES. THAT CAUSES A A QUESTION WHETHER THE WHETHER THIS RAG REMAINS CURRENT FOR THE PRESIDENT ENVIRONMENT. SO I A IT IS IT IS A FANTASY TO SUGGEST THAT AWAY AL IS DOING THIS WORK. REALLY WHAT YOU HAVE STATE GOVERNMENT AND NOT JUST DATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. IS THE NEAREST THING YOU HAVE TO A PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE. YOU PASSED THE LAW. THEIR DOCTOR RAG AND THEY'RE GOING TO DO THAT. UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE KINDA RE EXAMINE SINGS OR PROP TO RE EXAMINATION WHICH IS OUR FUNCTION -- IT IS OF COURSE YOU KNOW THE MODEL WITH OUR CHAMBERS IN. GOLD LEAF IN THE CHAMBERS IS DO THE LEGISLATURE. TO PASS JUST LOS. IN THE SENATE CHECK THE LIBERTY OF ITS CITIZENS. THIS IS ACTUALLY A JUST LAW LIBERTY THE SERVICE AND THE LAWS BUT FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. AND NOT UNDULY RESTRAINING LIFE -- SO I THINK. IT IS A ONE TIME MATTER. AND HONESTLY I THINK. WE OUGHT TO HAVE. WE OUGHT TO STAND UP IS LAWMAKERS. FOR A WELL FOUNDED STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT WARRANTS THE EX THE EX RESPECT THAT WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD HAVE. AND I THINK THAT'S OUR JOB IS LAWMAKERS IT'S OUR FUNCTION THE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IT'S WHY WE ENGAGE IN OVERSIGHT -- SO THAT I I I'VE HEARD THE ARGUMENT BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A NEW RATIONALE FOR THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PAGES OF REGULATIONS WHICH PRESENTLY EXISTING CALIFORNIA [inaudible] I IT'S QUITE -- FOR YOU ANSWER PART OF THE QUESTION BY MISTER BIDDING IS QUESTION BUT ON THE NEW REGULATIONS THAT ARE FORMED WITH -- AWAY EL DO YOU KNOW THAT. IF THEY ARE MONITORING IF THE REGULATIONS ARE ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED AT ALL SO -- WE PASS. TELL A LAW WE HAVE A TIME. FOR IT TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND ARE THEY ACTUALLY MONITORING DO THEY GET IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD HERE LAST YEAR ON ACCOUNTABILITY. IS HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THE LAW IS BEING IMPLEMENTED I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THE THE OIL LAW WAS AUTHORED BY SPEAKER LEO MCCARTHY NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE SIGNED BY JERRY BROWN IT IS AUTHORITY BASED. IT'S AN EXAMINATION OF IS THE PROPOSED REGULATION FOUNDED UPON THE AUTHORIZES STATUTES THEY HAVE THE SEVEN LEGAL CRITERIA THEY APPLY TO EVALUATE REGULATIONS. BUT NO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE ONGOING IMPLEMENTATION THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB. IT'S LIKE IS IT IS IT JUST FIVE WITHIN THE FOUR CORNERS A STATUTE IS A SUPPORTED. ARE ON SOME LEVEL BASED UPON THE TIME OF THE THEIR EXAMINE IT THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS IT. EFFECTIVELY DRAFTED DISAPPEAR THIS GOING TO WORK SO THERE IS CERTAINLY A ATTENTION TO ITS EFFECT IN THE REAL WORLD WOULD YOU OR YOUR BILL WORK ON THAT PART OR JEFF I WOULD SAY THAT THE THE ONGOING WORK I'VE DONE ON THE SUPPORTING OVERSIGHT PEARL THE STANDING COMMITTEES THE BODY. WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT GUIDE THAT'S OUT THERE ARE STANDING COMMITTEES ARE ENCOURAGED TO OVERSIGHT. I WOULD SAY THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONGOING WORK THE LEGISLATURE GAUGING OVERSIGHT. WHAT STRUCK TO EVERY AGENCY? OF THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WE SEE IT HAPPEN IN OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. I GIVE A CREDIT TO MISTER TING AND HIS COLLEAGUES IN THE OTHER HOUSE. BUDGET COMMITTEE DOES THIS WORK THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE PLAYS A VERY KEY ROLE OVERSIGHT. SOMEWHAT UNIQUE TO THE OTHER STANDING COMMITTEES BECAUSE THE TASK OF THIS. BOARD AND EACH SUBJECT MATTER. THE WHOLE PREMISE OF OVERSIGHT IS THAT WE HAVE OUR THIRTY ONE STANDING COMMITTEES. ALL OF WHOM. WE HAVE WE ARE DEVELOPING SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT STAFF SUBJECT BY SUBJECT BY SUBJECT. AND THAT'S STAFF IS TASKED WITH REVIEWING NEW BILLS. BUT ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON HOW EXIST TO DOLLARS BEING IMPLEMENTED. SORT OF A COMES THEIR ATTENTION THAT MAY BE THE LEAD TO TRY TO TAKE A PEEK AT SOMETHING -- THEY CAN DO THAT SO I'D SAY THE ONGOING FUNCTION OVERSIGHT. IS REALLY. IN THE LEGISLATURE -- SO THIS BILL ACTUALLY IS NOT DESIGNED TO YES SIR TO GET INTO THAT. IT'S MORE A SNAPSHOT IN TIME. LOOKING AT PRUNING [inaudible] IF APPROPRIATE. PAUL JUST FOLLOW UP WHICH I DO APPRECIATE THE BILL I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. BUT AS WAS NOTED. YOU KNOW THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THAT HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME SO IF WE JUST USE TECHNOLOGY AS ONE ON ON OUR BOOKS. WHEN WE LOOK AT A DECADE TWO DECADES AGO? THERE THERE'S MANY THINGS THAT WE WERE DOING THEN THAT WERE PROBABLY NOT EVEN LOOKINGAT NOW ALSO CLEANING UP AS YOU MIGHT SAY AS A METAPHOR. I THINK -- DEFINITELY IS SOMETHING THAT WE ONLY DID DO AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND DIVE MISTER PATTERSON. I'M SCHOOL THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD -- OF I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY -- BUT JUST A LITTLE INDICATION OF HOW DEEP AND WIDE -- THAT THE PROBLEM REALLY IS -- THERE'S AN AREA THAT I'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN WHICH IS TITLED TWENTY TWO AND HEALTH CODE IN NINETEEN SIXTY SOMETHING IT WAS PASSED NINETEEN SEVENTY IT WAS LAST MODERNIZED. AND IF YOU TALK TO HOSPITALS CLINICS DOCTORS IT'S AFTER. THEY WILL TELL YOU THE TITLE TWENTY TWO IS SO OUTDATED. AND IF YOU TALK TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF TITLE. TWENTY TWO TODAY THEY WILL SAY IT IS IN FACT OUT DATED TO WHAT DEGREE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THE REGULATIONS REQUIRE AN ACTION. THAT IS SO OUTDATED THAT THE ONLY THING THAT THE DEPARTMENT CAN DO AND THE ONLY THING THAT THE HOSPITAL OR IS TO SAY. WE REQUEST A WAIVER. GO CHECK HOW MANY WAIVERS ARE GIVEN OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SO THAT THE THE REGULATION IS ESSENTIALLY SO OUTDATED AS TO BE IRRELEVANT TO THE PRESENT. TIME -- AND SO I THINK THAT IF WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT DUPLICATIVE IF WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT REGULATIONS -- THAT BORE WANT MAYBE ONCE SERVED A PURPOSE BUT SIMPLY. ARE SO OUTDATED -- SO I I APPRECIATE THE WORK AS AS FAR AS IT DOES GO BUT I DO THINK WE THIS THIS COMMITTEE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT SO MANY OF THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE SO OUTDATED THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GET WAVE AFTER WAVE AFTER WAVE. FOR WHICH BASICALLY SAYS PRIME APHASIA THAT THE REGULATION IS SO OUTDATED IT TO BE MEANINGLESS AND YET THE HOSPITALS HAVE TO GO THROUGH. ASKING FOR THE WAIVER. UP THE SPENDING STAFF TIME ON IT OFTENTIMES HAVING TO HAVE PROFESSIONALS RIGHT THE WAIVER LANGUAGE. AND THE WAIVERS AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR SO I PLEDGE FOR THE EFFORT I THINK AND I THINK THIS IS. THE THE VALUABLE ROLE OF OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE SO I LIKE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. A GREAT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I SIXTY NINE I I ALSO SUPPORT THE SPELLING AGREE. MISTER CLAY WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT'S JUST THE KIND OF THING THAT. THE MOST CALIFORNIANS WOULD LIKE US TO BE DOING AND I DO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE. I THINK IT'S HARD TO ARGUE AGAINST JUST WHAT SEEMS TO BE KIND OF A FUNDAMENTAL ATTEMPT TO JUST THREE STREAMLINING RATIONALIZE. REGULATIONS THAT ARE REALLY NOT DOING ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE OTHER THAN YOU KNOW KIND OF ADDING RED TAPE ADDING. UNNECESSARY LAYERS OF CONFUSION -- I THINK PERHAPS AS THIS MOVES FOR THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO PARTNER WITH WITH YOU ALL TO GET YOU. TO PLACE THE BEING COMFORTABLE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THE THINGS YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ARE THE THINGS THAT. MR COOLEY IS IS REALLY TRYING. TRYING TO DO WITH THE SPELL -- TO THANK YOU I AGREE WITH YOU THAT IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND AND GOOD GOVERNMENT SO.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR UNDERTOOK AN AUDIT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION IS GRANT ISSUANCE PROCESS AND AMONGST THEIR FINDINGS. WAS THE FACT THAT THE D. O. R. E. N.. HAD IN SEVERAL CASES ASSIGNED EVALUATORS TO THOSE GRANTS THAT HAD A DIRECT CONFLICT OF INTEREST BECAUSE THE EVALUATOR. USED TO BE A MEMBER OF THE STAFF OF THE AGENCY THAT WAS APPLYING FOR THE GRAND SO THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDED THAT WE ADOPTED STATUTE A PROHIBITION AGAINST THAT KIND OF BEHAVIOR SO THIS BILL AB. TEN THIRTEEN IMPLEMENTS THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION IT SAYS THAT STATE AGENCIES SHALL NOT ASSIGN GRANT TODAY WAITERS TO EVALUATE GRANTS THAT HAVE A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE AYE THE A PLAYER FOR THE GRANT. BECAUSE THAT COULD CREATE THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS WHICH IS CORROSIVE TO A FREE DEMOCRACY. AT THIS IS COMMON SENSE GOOD GOVERNMENT LEGISLATION I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF ON THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE BILL -- AMONGST THE POINTS OF THE DISCUSSION IN THE ANALYSIS IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WE LOOK AT PERHAPS NOT A LIFETIME BAN BUT SOME SOMETHING MORE LIMITED SO THAT JUST HAVING SERVED ON STAFF DOES NOT PROHIBIT YOU FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE FOR BEING A GRANT EVALUATOR AND I THINK. THAT'S A REASONABLE ONE WE'RE TO BE LOOKING AT THAT MOVING FORWARD I MAY BE LOOKING AT FOR SIMILAR SITUATIONS IN FEDERAL LAW -- THAT WE COULD USE A AND AND ADOPT FOR THIS PURPOSE.

RIGHT MOVING TO I MR COVER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SEVENTY TWO THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION FREE BECAME AN ACT WOULD REQUIRE STATE CONTRAST COMPRISE OF FOREST RISK COMMODITIES LIKE PALM OIL SOY. CATTLE RUBBER APPALLED. ENTERED A RENEWED ON OR AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE TO CERTIFY THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS ARE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. EVERY COMPANY CONTRACTED WITH CALIFORNIA FOR SUCH COMMODITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE IN PLACE A NO DEFORESTATION NO P.. NO EXPLOITATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE NDP POLICY. AT A DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS POLICY IS BEING IMPLEMENTED FULLY AND IN GOOD FAITH. TROPICAL DEFORESTATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAT CAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE. AS WELL AS WIDE RANGING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS. THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION CREEP ACUMEN ACT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL EFFORTS TO END TROPICAL DEFORESTATION BY ENSURING THAT ENTITIES CONTRACT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION DIRECTLY. OR THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. AB BY SEVENTY TWO EXTENDS CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP THE PROTECTION TROPICAL FORESTS AND SENDS A CRUCIAL SIGNAL TO GLOBAL MARKETS THAT ILLEGAL AND DESTRUCTIVE COMMODITY DRIVEN DEFORESTATION. WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. AB BY SEVENTY TWO IS NOT DISSIMILAR TO WAYS TGS CERTIFIES CONTRACTORS. UP. FROM NOT ENGAGING IN CERTAIN BEHAVIORS IN THE BILL IS MODELED AFTER AN EXISTING PROCUREMENT BAN AGAINST CHILD LABOR. THE STATE HAS HAD IN PRACTICE FOR MANY YEARS. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL IS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO BE A GOTCHA POLICY FOR INCIDENTAL USES AND FACTOR IS LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR CONTRACTORS THAT UNKNOWINGLY USE FOR US WAS COMMODITIES IN PARAGRAPH OF TWO OF THE BILL. THERE IS A REASONABLE EXPECTATION ON STATE CONTRACTORS IN RETURN FOR THE BUSINESS TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS THE PRODUCT THEY'RE SOURCING NOT. INCLUDE FOREST RISK COMMODITIES. ALSO IN ORDER TO PROMOTE GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES. AB BY SEVENTY TWO REQUIRES DIGEST TO DEVELOP A DEPORTATION FREE CODE OF CONDUCT THAT INCLUDES A LIST OF POOREST RISK. COMMODITIES AND GUIDANCE TO CONTRACTORS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY FOR US WAS COMMODITIES. IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND IS IS AS IS OUR CUSTOMARY PRACTICE WERE NOT A TIME TO BE OVERLY PRESCRIPTIVE YOU WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CREATE. A PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITH THEM. I WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY IS NICK SACK FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION WILL BE INTRODUCING DOUG NORTHERN REPRESENTING PENS THE EARTH AND KATIE CLEARY ON BEHALF OF PEACE FOR ANIMALS. HELLO MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR CO SPONSOR SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ACTIONS TO AND TROPICAL DEFORESTATION AND PROTECT TROPICAL FORCE AS UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT ECOSYSTEMS. THAT PROVIDE HABITAT TO NEARLY KLAY MOTHER MUCH OF THE PLANET'S. MOST ICONIC AND TREASURED WILDLIFE TROPICAL FORESTS ARE ALSO CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF THE EARTH WATER WHETHER AN OXYGEN CYCLES. IN FUNCTION AS A GLOBALLY HOWEVER TROPICAL FORESTS ARE GRAVELY THREATENED AN ESTIMATED EIGHTEEN MILLION ACRES OF TROPICAL FORESTS ARE LOST EVERY YEAR DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITIES. AND TROPICAL DEFORESTATION IS THE THIRD LEADING DRIVER OF CLIMATE CHANGE ACCOUNTING FOR AS MUCH AS 14% OF GLOBAL CO TWO EMISSIONS. THE THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF TROPICAL DEFORESTATION IS INDUSTRIAL SCALE PRODUCTION OF ALLIED AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES KNOWN AS FORCE RISK COMMODITIES SUCH AS PALM OIL SOY CATTLE. RUBBER PAPER PULP AND TIMBER. PRODUCTS CONTAINING THESE COMMODITIES ARE WIDELY CONSUMED INCLUDING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH ITS GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT. PROCUREMENT AND CONTRACTS. AS A SIGNATORY TO THE NEW YORK DECLARATION ON FOREST. CALIFORNIA SET A GOAL TO CUT DEFORESTATION IN HALF BY TWENTY TWENTY AND TO AND TO ENTIRELY BY. TWENTY THIRTY IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA HAS LONG UNDERSTOOD THE OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING TROPICAL DEFORESTATION TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS AS EXPRESSED IN THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP IN THE GOVERNOR'S CLIMATE AND FORCE TASK FORCE. AB FIVE SEVEN TWO WOULD NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT'S DIRECT CONTRIBUTION TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION A SUBSTANTIAL MEASURE ON ITS OWN. IT WOULD ALSO SEND A CRUCIAL SIGNAL TO THE GLOBAL MARKET THE DESTRUCTIVE COMMODITY DRIVEN DEFORESTATION WILL NO LONGER BE TOLERATED. AND JUST AS IMPORTANT AB FIVE SEVEN TWO WOULD START THE CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT HOW WE AS A STATE. ARE NOT INADVERTENTLY CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION WITH ALL THE ECOLOGICAL CLIMATE AND SOCIAL DAMAGES THAT COME WITH IT. WITH THAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. AND I GIVE THE MICROPHONE TO THAT KNOWING THE FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND RESPECTED MEMBERS. MY NAME IS DOUG NORRLAND I DIRECT THE ECONOMIC POLICY PROGRAM. AT FRIENDS OF THE EARTH U. S. -- FRIENDS HERE IT IS A INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF SEVENTY FIVE EFFECTIVE IN -- SEVENTY FIVE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. INCLUDING MANY OF THE COUNTRIES -- THAT THIS BILL IS CONCERNED WITH IN THE US WE HAVE ONE POINT. SEVEN MILLION ACTIVE MEMBERS AND WE WERE CREATED ACTUALLY HER RIGHT HERE IN. CALIFORNIA. AS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD IN GIVEN CALIFORNIA'S SERIOUS COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS. THE STATE HAS RESPONSIBILITY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE OUR PURCHASING POWER TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. OF TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO IS THE MOST DIRECT THE EASIEST AND THE CHEAPEST WAY TO DO THIS. BY REQUIRING THAT COMPANIES PROVIDING FOR STRICT PRODUCTS TO CALIFORNIA. UNDERTAKE THOROUGH DUE DILIGENCE IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. THIS BILL SIMPLY ASKS CONTRACTING ACTORS TO DO WHAT THEY SHOULD DO. AND WHAT MANY OF THEM ARE ALREADY -- DOING AND COMMIT AND ARE COMMITTED TO DO. THAT IS TO TRACE THE COMMODITIES THEY BUY BACK TO WHERE THEY COME FROM. AND TO AFFIRM THAT THESE COMMODITIES ARE NOT PRODUCED AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR LAST REMAINING TROPICAL FORESTS OR THE PEOPLE OR WILDLIFE. UPON WHOM THESE FORESTS ARE HOME -- THIS BILL WILL ALSO HELP CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. FOR BUSINESS SO THAT THE BEST COMPANY. THE INCREASINGLY LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED TO ELIMINATING DEFORESTATION FROM THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS WON'T FACE UNDUE COMPETITION FROM THE LAGGARDS. THE ONES WHO UP UNTIL NOW. REFUSED TO FOLLOW BEST INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES HUMAN RIGHTS NORMS AND SUSTAINABLE SOURCING PRINCIPLES. THIS IS CALIFORNIA'S BEST CHANCE TO A PLAYER GREAT STATES CLIMATE LEADERSHIP TO THE SUPPLY CHAINS. OF THE MANY MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES ON WHO MORE CONSUMPTION DEPENDS. IF WE CARE ABOUT THE IMPACT OF OUR STATES CUMPLIR CONSUMPTION. HAS ON THE REST OF THE WORLD AB FIVE SEVENTY TWO IS THE LEAST WE CAN DO I THANK YOU AND WE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT WITH THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US MADAM CHAIR -- MY NAME IS KATIE CLEARY AND THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF WORLD ANIMAL NEWS AND PEACE FOR ANIMALS OUT OF LOS ANGELES -- AND I'M ALSO THE BOARD MEMBER OF SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION -- FOR A FEW YEARS FOR A FEW YEARS NOW AND WORKING ON MY SECOND DOCUMENTARY CALLED WE ARE ONE AND IT'S HAS TO DO WITH THE CONNECTION BETWEEN -- ANIMALS ENDANGERED SPECIES ON OUR PLANET AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES. AND SO THIS PAST FOLLOWS IN SUMATRAN BORNEO FILMING AND I SAW SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE -- DEFORESTED LAND -- FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MILES -- ILLEGALLY DEFORESTED ACTUALLY -- BURNED TO THE GROUND -- WE RESCUED ENTERING A TANK THAT WAS FOUR MONTHS PREGNANT FROM A PALM OIL PLANTATION ACTUALLY SURROUNDED. BY OTHER PALMA PLANTATIONS AND DIED SHE WAS SHOT -- MOST DURING IT HANGS ARE SHOT TO SHOT WITH A TWENTY TWO BILLION IN OUR SIDE -- ABOUT 90% OF RAINY TANKS ARE SHOT -- BECAUSE THEY ARE CONSIDERED PASSED BY THE PALM OIL INDUSTRY AND OTHER INDUSTRIES AS WELL -- IT TOOK AN HOUR TO SEDATE HER -- WE EVENTUALLY WERE ABLE -- TO YOU KNOW CATCHER IN AND THAT'S AND WE FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT AT THAT TIME IT WAS TOGETHER WITH HEARING TING INFORMATION CENTER. AND I THINK THAT IF MOST PEOPLE SAW THIS FOOTAGE AND REALIZE THAT. FOR THE 500-002-60000 RINGGIT HANGS ARE THE ONLY ONES REMAINING IN THE WILD -- OF WHICH MOST OF THEM ARE REMAIN IN SUMATRA AND BORNEO AND VERY FEW AND IN JAVA ON THE ISLAND OF JAVA -- BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING -- HERE IS THAT -- THERE'S THERE'S A DEMAND AND THE DEMAND WE DON'T KNOW -- IS -- THE RIGHT DEMAND SEWED DO WE REALLY PUT A PRICE ON THE EXTINCTION OF THE SPEECH IS NOT ONLY THE SPECIES BUT THERE'S ONLY FIVE HUNDRED SUMATRAN TIGERS LEFT IN THE WILD. YOU CAN WE WERE WE SPENT ABOUT TWO WEEKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RAINFOREST WE COULDN'T SEE WITHIN SEE -- ONE THEY'RE SO RARE NOT ONLY THAT -- THE THE JOB AND RIGHT NOW. WE THINK THERE'S ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY REMAINING AND IT'S DUE TO DEFORESTATION AND AND LACK OF HABITAT AND THE CORRIDORS -- CONNECTING THEM ARE THE ONLY THING LEFT TO BE ABLE TO DIVERSIFY -- THEIR DNA -- TO SAVE THEIR SPECIES FROM EXTINCTION SO WE'RE TALKING POSSIBLY -- THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE MIGHT LOSE ALL THE SPEECHES IN INDONESIA TO EXTINCTION IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING QUICKLY AND CALIFORNIA HAS THE ABILITY -- TO REALLY PUT A POLICY IN PLACE TO PROTECT OUR FORESTS OF WHICH WE GAME 30% OF OUR OXYGEN OF COURSE THE REST 70% -- YOU KNOW COMES FROM THE OCEAN -- AND OF COURSE -- YOU KNOW BEING A VOICE FOR THE VOICELESS AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO -- YOU KNOW WE SHARE THE PLANET WITH UPWARDS OF EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION SPECIES THAT WE KNOW OF IN THE RAIN FOREST -- HUNDRED MILLION THAT WE MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT BECAUSE IT'S BEING DESTROYED SO I REALLY ENCOURAGE YOU -- IF IF I CAN SHOW YOU -- THE FOOTAGE THAT WE TOOK IT IS SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL FOOTAGE OF EVER SEEN AND IT WAS THE HARDEST THING TO DO. BEING IN THAT RAIN FOREST -- AND A HUNDRED TWENTY DEGREE WEATHER LITERALLY -- SAVING THIS THIS FEMALE RANG A TANG AND WE RELOCATED HER SUCCESSFULLY BUT IT'S BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE RAIN FOREST -- THAT THIS IS HAPPENING AND SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING -- THEIR THEIR CALL DURING ITS HANG THEY MEAN PERSON OF THE RAIN FOREST -- IN INDONESIAN SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AND AGAIN COULD WE REALLY PUT A PRICE ON EXTINCTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AS A MODERATE SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION IN LOS ANGELES IN FULL SUPPORT THANK YOU.

OKAY MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM TO MISTER CHIU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES. THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS DELAYS IN PAYMENT TO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTORS FOR EXTRA WORK THAT HAS BEEN PERFORMED. THE BILL'S VERY SIMPLE IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE SUNSET DATE FROM A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN LAW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED THAT CLOSED A LOOPHOLE IN PROP PAYMENT LAW. WHEN IT COMES TO HOW TO DECIDE HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES ARE IN THE CLAIMS PROCESS -- THAT HAS. OFTENTIMES HAPPEN WHEN PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE NOT HAD MUCH OF AN INCENTIVE TO PAY CONTRACTORS AND A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE PUBLIC COUNTRY CODE PROVIDES PROMPT PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS IN MANY OTHER AREAS OF THE CONSTRUCTION PAYMENT PROCESS WITHOUT THE PROCESS OF THE PREVIOUS BILL IMPLEMENTED WITHIN THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE.
