AGAIN TODAY WERE GONNA FOCUS ON THE INCIDENT IN ORVILLE. AND TODAY'S IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. TO UPDATE US ON THE RECOVERY AND MORE BROADLY THE STATE'S EFFORT ON OVERALL DAM SAFETY. WHAT WE LEARNED FROM ORVILLE? HOW CAN SIMILAR INCIDENTS BE PREVENTED? WHAT IS THE STATE'S AGENCIES ON THE A WATER CONTRACTORS HOWARD THOSE THINGS WORKING TOGETHER? TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE CALIFORNIA STAY SAFE AND AND HAVE WATER DELIVERED DO WE HAVE GAPS STILL ON WHAT MORE CAN WE DO. AND A NEW COURSES HEARINGS ESPECIALLY TIMELY BECAUSE WE JUST HAD THE REPORT COME OUT FROM THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAM. WHO INVESTED THE HORRIBLE INCIDENT? SO I'D LIKE TO THANK THE LEADER OF THAT BY JOAN FRANCE FOR BEING HERE WITH US TODAY. AND IT ALSO A LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HOPE THE DIRECTOR IS DOING WELL HE WAS CALLED AWAY ANA ON AN EMERGENCY SO TODAY WE HAVE CHIEF DEPUTY. AM CINDY MEISSNER FROM. D. W. ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. SO WELCOME EVERYBODY. AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF MR GARCIA WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS. FROM CRAFT I THINK WE'LL SEE THE FIRST PANEL. ANYBODY ELSE WHY MAKE ANY OPENING WELCOMING MISTER GALLAGHER FROM CRACK AYE MR GALLAGHER REPRESENTS THAT AREA. OMINOUS PEOPLE EVER BEFORE I HAVE FAMILY IN THAT AREA. WE WENT UP AND DID A TOUR A COUPLE WEEKS AGO STOOD AT THE BOTTOM STOOD AT THE TOP IT'S CALIFORNIA'S PROCESS. TWO ON THE FIRST PANEL WE HAVE CINDY AS A SAID THAT MEANT MESSER. MR SHOULD MEASURE SHE'S THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES WE HAVE JOHN FRANCE WHO'S A LEAD MEMBER OF THE INDEPENDENT FORENSICS TEAM. AND WE HOPPED JOLE. WHAT DOES MY DAD REDIRECTOR OF STATE WATER PROJECT W. ARE THANK YOU AND WELCOME ALL OF YOU? UP THERE AGAIN OKAY AND I BELIEVE. OKAY SO HOPEFULLY EVERYONE HAS A POWER POINT PRESENTATION. AND WILL GO THROUGH THAT JUST A SECOND BUT MORE MATURE ONE HAS. SO GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR CHAIRMAN IN MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WERE SO ARTICULATELY SET UP BY THE. CHAIRWOMAN. AGAIN JUST FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS CINDY MESSER I AM THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND I AM STANDING IN TODAY FOR DIRECTOR. SO I AM WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST OFFER SOME OPENING REMARKS AND THEN QUICKLY DO AN OVERVIEW TO SERVE RE ORIENT EVERYONE TO WHAT HAPPENED LAST FEBRUARY. AND THEN RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE ACTIONS THAT THE DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE HAS UNDERTAKEN IN THIS LAST ALMOST YEAR NOW. IN TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION REPAIRS AND RECOVERY AND THEN I'LL TURN THINGS OVER TO MR FRANCE TO WALK THROUGH THE A INDEPENDENT FRIENDS EIGHTEEN REPORT. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WE ARE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE MEMBERS MAY HAVE. SO BEAR WITH ME WHEN I READ A LITTLE BIT FROM THE NOTES THAT I INHERITED SALONIKA SO. AS YOU ALL KNOW THE MAJOR FOCUS OVER THE LAST TEN MINUTES FOR THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN THE STATE'S EFFORT TO RECONSTRUCT. THE LAKE OROVILLE SPILLWAYS. COME BOTH SPILLWAYS TO ENSURE PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH THIS NOW RAINY SEASON THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING. AND TO CONTINUE PLANNING FOR THE REMAINING CONSTRUCTION THAT WILL BE HAPPENING THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN. I APPRECIATE IN THE DEPARTMENT APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED AT ORVILLE RESERVOIR SINCE YOUR LAST OVERSIGHT HEARING BACK IN MANY. DEPARTMENTS DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS AND THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ALSO HERE AND I KNOW THERE THE SECOND PANEL. ON THE AGENDA TO DISCUSS SOME OF THE CHANGES MADE BY THIS LEGISLATURE BACK IN JULY. THEIR PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING VITAL ISSUES HIGHLIGHTED BY THE OROVILLE INCIDENT. THESE ACTIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THROUGH PROVISIONS OF THE GOVERNOR'S FOUR POINT PLAN. THAT WAS RELEASED LAST FEBRUARY. TO OUR TO DO THE FOLLOWING AND I'D LIKE TO JUST RUN THROUGH THOSE VERY QUICKLY. SO THE ACTIONS INCLUDE A DEDICATION OF FUNDING. TO IMPROVE FLOOD PER PROTECTION FOR THE STATE. IT REQUIRES INUNDATION COURTS OUR IT REQUIRED INUNDATION MAPPING AND EMERGENCY ACTION PLANNING BY DAM OWNERS. IT ENHANCED CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING DAM SAFETY INSPECTION PROCESS SEIZE. AND IT SOUGHT ACTION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REGARDING THEIR OWN DAMN INSPECTIONS THE UPDATE OF OPERATION MANUALS FOR THE STATE'S RESERVOIRS. AND THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO FACILITATE DAM REHABILITATION EFFORTS. YOU WILL HEAR TODAY HOW THE SPECIFIC CHANGES TO THESE INSPECTIONS AND TO THE MAPPING. AND THE PLANNING EFFORTS AT DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAMS REPORT. AS YOU WELL KNOW OF THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAM WAS TASKED WITH DETERMINING THE LIKELY CAUSES OF THE EROSION AND THE SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE TO THE LAKE ORVILLE SPILLWAYS. LAST FRIDAY THE TEAM RELEASED ITS FINAL REPORT. AND I KNOW THAT THIS REPORT IS OF GREAT INTEREST TO THESE COMMITTEES. AND WE WILL MOVE TO THAT PART OF THE PRESENTATION SHORTLY BUT BEFORE THAT AS I MENTIONED I'D LIKE TO OPEN A FEW OFFER A FEW OPENING REMARKS IN AN OVERVIEW. AND THEN I WILL TURN THINGS OVER TO MR FRANCE. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY ON BEHALF OF D. W. ARE THAT WE APPRECIATE THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAMS WORK. AND WE TAKE THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY AND YOU WILL HEAR US PROBABLY REITERATE THAT POINT THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTE ASIANS AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS. WE AGREE WITH THEIR STATEMENT THAT THIS IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR THE DAM SAFETY INDUSTRY. AND WE WILL USE THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS INCIDENT. STRENGTHEN OUR OWN DAMN SAFETY PROGRAM AND TO HELP LEAD THE WAY AND MODERNIZING. AND CREATING AN EVENT INNOVATIVE INDUSTRY STANDARDS FOR THE DAM FOR DAM SAFETY. IN THE STATE AND BEYOND. WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE DAM SAFETY INDUSTRY AS WELL AS WITH ACADEMIA. THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO IDENTIFY STRONGER SCIENCE BASED STRATEGIES AND METHODS TO EVALUATE OPERATE AND MAINTAIN PARDEE HOMES. THE REPORT IDENTIFIES ISSUES WITH THE ORIGINAL DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY. AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR MORE IN DEPTH EVALUATIONS OF ALL ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES OF A DIEM FACILITY NOT JUST THE DAM ITSELF. ADDITIONALLY IT SHOWS THE NEED TO DIG DEEPER INTO THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION AND GEOLOGICAL DATA IN FUTURE REVIEWS OF DAMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES. FOR THESE REASONS THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DATA HOMES HAS ALREADY BEGUN THESE RE EVALUATIONS OF SPILLWAYS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO OR OF BILLS IN THEIR AGE THEIR SIZE AND THEIR DESIGN. AND WE'LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THAT LATER. WITH THE HELP OF OUR CONTRACTOR. AND THE OVERSIGHT FROM AN INDEPENDENT BOARD OF CONSULTANTS. STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORS GW R. HAS SUCCESSFULLY REBUILT THE MAIN SPILLWAY. I'M AS OF NOVEMBER FIRST BRINGING IT TO TODAY'S STANDARDS. AND IN DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING THE MAIN SPILLWAY. GWR TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE TWENTY FOUR POTENTIAL FAILURE MECHANISMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE INDEPENDENT FRIENDS SIXTEEN BACK IN THERE MEMO FROM OF THE MAY TIMEFRAME. WE HAVE TAKEN THOSE INTO CONSIDERATION. WE'VE INCLUDED. MANY MODERN STANDARDS AND ADDRESSED ISSUES IN THE. CONSTRUCTION OF THE REPAIRS OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY. THESE. POTENTIAL CAUSES ARE ALSO A FOCUS OF THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS SPILLWAY RE EVALUATIONS. AND WITH THAT I'M GONNA SWITCH GEARS AND MOVE INTO THE POWER POINT PRESENTATION ALBUM. TRY TO KEEP US GOING ON WHICH NUMBER SLIGHT MONSTER. OKAY EVERYONE HAS THAT SUNROOM IN BEHIND ME AND I'M ITS PROBLY NOT VISIBLE BECAUSE IT'S DIRECTLY BEHIND ME BUT WE HAVE SOME BLOWN UP FIGURES JUST A FEW OF THE IMAGES THAT ARE IN YOUR POWER POINT. AND WE MAY REAP REFERENCE THOSE IT DOWN AGAIN AS WE GO THROUGH THE PRESENTATION. OKAY SO MANY JUMPED TO SLIDE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAKE OROVILLE SPILLWAYS INCIDENT AREA. AND THIS IS JUST QUICKLY TO REORIENT EVERYONE TO WHAT. THE STRUCTURES LOOK LIKE IN THE ORIENTATION UP THERE SO VERY QUICKLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE IMAGE. TO THE RIGHT OF OF THE PAGE IS THE DAM ITSELF. AND AT THE BASE OF THE DAM IS THE HIGHEST POWER PLANT IN CONCEDE THERE'S SMALL A GREAT FIGURE. AND THERE'S ALSO THE DIVERSION POOL WHICH. COMES OUT OF THEM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM. IF YOU MOVE OVER TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THIS FIGURE I SHOULD POINT OUT THERE'S THERE'S FIVE STRUCTURES ARE MINUTE. POINT TO THE DAM THE POWER PLANTS THEDIVERSION PULL MOVING OVER TO THE LEFT THE MAIN ITEM OR GATED. SPILLWAY WILL PROBABLY GO BACK AND FORTH WITH TERMINOLOGY ON THOSE TWO SAME THING MAIN SPILLWAY. I'M YOU CAN SEE THAT THE IMAGE THERE AND HOW THE WATER SORT OF FANS OUT BECAUSE THIS PHOTO WAS TAKEN AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. AND THEN SHIPPED TO THE LEFT OF THAT IS THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY WHICH IS KIND OF. THAT YOU CAN SEE IT'S. SORT OF THE RED SOIL BEAR AREA THAT'S TO THE LA JUST TO THE LEFT OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY. SO THIS IS THE DAM IN ALL OF THE ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE HEARING IN OUR INFORMATION TODAY. SO MOVING IN TO THE NEXT SLIDE. QUICKLY AGAIN WANTED TO REMIND EVERYONE AND SET THE STAGE AGAIN FOR THE WEATHER. THAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING FEBRUARY JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OF LAST YEAR. THIS IMAGE SHOWS THE SERIES OF ATMOSPHERIC REVERSE THAT HIT THE WEST COAST OF NORTH AMERICA BETWEEN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. AYE SHE THIS IS A LONGER STRETCH I'M SORRY IF I CAN KEEP IT ONE ONE SECOND IF YOU JUST GO BACK FOR. BUT AND AND TALK ABOUT THE TRANSMISSION LINES I WAS RELEASED REQUIRE THAT WHEN I WAS OUT. A ON THE OPEN AND LOOKING AT THE DAM. JUST THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAD TO GO INTO A DON'T KNOW THAT BUT PEOPLE I THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE TRANSMISSION LINES THAT WERE OUT THERE THAT ALL HAD TO BE MOVED. YES ABSOLUTELY I'M SORRY I PROBABLY SHOULD APPOINTED THAT OUT YOU CAN BARELY SEE THEM IN THIS IMAGE BUT YES THOSE WERE PART OF IN. WALL TALK ABOUT THOSE WHEN WE GET INTO SORT OF THE BALANCING OF THE RISK WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN AND THAT WAS. I'M TOLD YOU WANNA HEAR WELL I THINK. THAT. SORRY AND I GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR INVITING US TODAY. I THINK YES THAT. TOWER THAT YOU CAN SEE RIGHT TO THE LEFT OF THE A SPILLWAY WAS A GREAT CONCERN AND THAT TOWER. WORKS BACKWARDS TOWARDS. TO. DISC. POWER THE TRANSMISSION LINE FOR P. G. ANY SO THAT LINE IF WE HAD LOST IT AT THE TIME WOULD HAVE LOST POWER TO THE RADIO GATES. THAT WERE ALLOWING US TO TO RELEASE WATER AND IT WOULD HAVE. TAKEN OUT THE POWER FOR THE POWER PLANT WHICH WOULD HAVE TAKEN AS MONTHS TO REBUILD THAT POWER LINE SO TO TO ACTIONS WERE TAKING AT THE TIME DURING THE IMMERSING ONE IS TO RELOCATE THE POWER LINES UP ABOVE. THE. THE RADIO GAVE STRUCTURE SO THAT IT'S OUT OF THE WAY AND THEN. ULTIMATELY REROUTED COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE SPILLWAY SO THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER BE A THREAT NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OKAY SO. QUICKLY ON THE NEXT SLIDE WANTED TO AGAIN POINT OUT THE NUMBER OF ATMOSPHERIC REVERSED THAT HIT OF THE WEST COAST LAST WINTER. AND ESPECIALLY IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WE EXPERIENCED THE WETTEST ABOUT. TWO MONTHS ON IN A. HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS OF RECORD KEEPING FOR THE FEATHER RIVER BASIN. SO. AS. WE WERE BALANCING INFLOWS AND RAINFALL AND STORM EVENTS IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS AND YOU WILL SEE ON THE NEXT SLIDE. WE HAD THE INCIDENT OCCUR AT THE MAIN SPILLWAY. AND ONE THING ABOUT BEEF I WILL JUST MENTION IN TERMS OF INFLOW. RIGHT AT THE POINT OF THE TIME OF INCIDENTS AROUND THE SIXTH OR SEVENTH OF FEBRUARY. THE STORM THAT WE EXPERIENCED DURING THAT TIME FRAME EXCEEDED THE FORECASTED AMOUNT IN THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WE EXPERIENCE SEVERAL TIMES LAST WINTER. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT BE AMOUNT WAS SUCCEEDED BY ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND OVER THE. AS THE MAIN SPILLWAY BEGAN TO A ROAD SAYS WE'RE HAVING THE ISSUE WE ARE ALSO HAVING A STORM THAT WAS MUCH LARGER THAN WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO PREDICT THE FORECASTING. SO THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS THE. THE INCIDENT. AS IT BEGAN ON THE SEVENTH. THIS WAS A POINT THAT DID OF YOUR STOPPED FLOWS ON THE MAIN SPILLWAY DURING THE SEVENTH TO ASSESS THE INITIAL DAMAGE. YOU CAN SEE BY THE PHOTO ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF OF YOUR PAPER THAT ANNA WE PUT SOME STATS IN THERE THAT THE DAMAGE INITIALLY WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET WIDE. FORTY FEET LONG AND THIRTY TO FORTY FEET DEEP. THE WHOLE THAT HAD BEEN CREATED. BUT I AND I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT EVEN AS WE WERE STOPPING FLOWS WE ARE EVALUATING THIS INITIAL DAMAGE WE HAD D. W. ARE EMPLOYEES IN CREWS THAT WERE BEGINNING PLANNING FOR RECOVERY AND REPAIRS IN THE IMMEDIATE TIME. AND. ALSO BEGINNING TO THINK LONGER TERM THROUGH THE WINTER SEASON THE SPRING AND BEYOND. SO. MOVING TO THE NEXT SLIDE HOME. WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT SIDE HERE. OH I'M SORRY I'M NOT BUT THAT'S OKAY WE CAN JUST GO THERE AND ALL KEEP TALKING FOR AWHILE HERE. THIS IS WHERE I WANTED TO POINT OUT AND THE FOUR MAIN RISKS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD TO BALANCE DURING THOSE HOURS AFTER BETWEEN FEBRUARY SEVENTH. AND THE TWELFTH. AS A WATER CONTINUED TO FLOW DOWN THE DAMAGED MEAN SPILLWAY BECAUSE WE HAD TO MANAGE INFLOWS. EROSION IN THE FAILURE OF THE SHOOT ITSELF CONTINUED AT AN ALARMING RATE EROSION WAS MOVING UP. UPWARDS UPHILL FASTER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED INITIALLY. THE HIGHEST RISK THAT WAS FACING THE DEPARTMENT WAS THE CONTINUED EROSION OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY TOWARDS THOSE GATES. THAT WE BELIEVE. HOW IT MADE ITS WAY TO THE GATES WOULD HAVE MEANT CATASTROPHIC AN UNCONTROLLED RELEASES OF WATER? SO THAT WAS OUR ONE OF OUR NUMBER ONE CONCERN WAS HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT. ADDITIONALLY WE HAD VAST AMOUNTS OF CONCRETE AND DEBRIS THAT HAD. BEEN PUSHED DOWN. THIS BILL WAY AND WERE BEING COLLECTED IN THE DIVERSION POLITIC POINTED OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE DAM. AND THAT WAS BEGINNING TO CAUSE A BACKUP OF WATER TOWARDS THE HYATT POWER PLANT IN INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF FLOODING IN THAT CRITICAL STRUCTURE. SO WITH A BROKEN MAIN SPILLWAY THE POWER PLANTS AS WE. SOUGHT AND CONTINUE TO SEE IT BECAME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AS THE ONLY OTHER WAY TO MANAGE. WATER RELEASES OUT OF THE REST OF WAR AND TO HAVE CONTROLLED RELEASES. FOR THE REMAINDER OF WINTER AND BEYOND INTO THE SPRING SESSION. AT THE SAME TIME DWI ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT THE POWER LINES HAS TOLD JUST DESCRIBED HOME TO US WHICH WERE INSTALLED ON THE HILLSIDE THAT WAS PARALLEL TO THE MAIN SPILLWAY. SAME HILLSIDE THAT WAS ERODING. WITHOUT THESE POWER LINES AS JOE POINTED OUT D. W. R. WOULD HAVE TEMPORARILY LOST ITS ABILITY TO OPERATE NOT ONLY THE POWER PLANT BUT HE MAIN GATES AT THE TOP OF THE SPILLWAY. AND THIS WOULD HAVE ON HIM TEMPORARILY COULD HAVE BEEN JUST A FEW DAYS BUT IN THE CASE OF THE POWER PLANT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONTHS. SO TO REDUCE THE RISK TO THE MAIN SPILLWAY THE POWER LINES IN THE POWER PLANT DWI ARE DECIDED TO REDUCE RELEASES FROM THE MAIN SPILLWAY. DWS MODELING SHOW THAT AT THESE REDUCED RELEASES THE DEPARTMENT WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO KEEP THE WEIGHT LAKE LEVEL AT A SAFE. LEVEL BELOW THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY CELL. HOWEVER INFLOWS INCREASED AND AS I MENTIONED BECAUSE OF THE STORM EVENT THAT HAD COME IN AND HAD. IT ACTUALLY HAS SEVERAL STORMS ARE COMING ITS APART. THEMSELVES OVER THE AREA AND THE RINK CONTINUE TO COME TO THE INFLOWS. CONTINUE TO INCREASE. AND LASTED LONGER THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED HARM. AND. AND LAKE LEVELS CONTINUE TO RISE WHICH RESULTED IN THE ULTIMATE USE OF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY ON FEBRUARY STARTING ON FEBRUARY ELEVENTH. AND SO NOW THE SUSPECTS ARE THE SLIGHT HAD YOU GUYS TURNED TO WAS JUST AS AN IMAGE OF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY AS EROSION WAS OCCURRING. THIS PHOTO TAKEN ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH. SO. ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH AS WE WATCHED THE HILLSIDE BELOW THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY BEGIN TO ERODE AND AGAIN MORE QUICKLY AT THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED. THIS WAS THE POINT IN TIME THAT IN PROVIDING INFORMATION TO THE BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF HER SHARE OF COREY HONI. IT WAS DECIDED THAT IN EVACUATION NEEDED TO OCCUR IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY SO THIS WAS ON THE TWELFTH. EAH. SO JUST ADD A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION AND I WAS PART OF THE INCIDENT COMMAND TEAM THAT WAS UP THERE FROM THE SEVENTH AND ULTIMATELY BECAME THE INCIDENT COMMANDER SOON AFTER THE EVACUATION SO I WAS THERE FROM THAT ALL THE WAY. ALMOST TO THE END OF MARCH. TO WE STABILIZED BUT I THINK THOSE RISKS. MANAGING THOSE RISKS MEANT THAT WE DID HAVE A TEAM THAT WAS PUTTING TOGETHER CONTINGENCIES FOR ALL THOSE RISKS. IN THE EVENT ANY OF THEM HAPPENED SO WE WERE NOT ONLY MANAGING THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAPPEN REDUCE THE RISK BUT WE WERE MANAGING RISK UP IF THAT HAPPENED WILL OUR CONTINGENCY PLANS. AND I THINK ON THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. OUR INTENT WAS NEVER TO USE IT. BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH WE NEEDED TO BE PREPARED IN CASE. THINGS UNPREDICTABLE THINGS LIKE THE WEATHER HAPPEN AND WE NEEDED TO THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A SCRUBBING THE HILLSIDE CLEARING IT. PUTTING. SHOTCRETE OR CONCRETE ON THE PRINTING THOSE WERE ALL CONTINGENCY PLANNING EFFORTS. IN THE EVENT IT HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH IT WAS NOT AND WE WERE HOPE WE WERE TRYING NOT TO LET THAT SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. ARE RISK MANAGER THAT WAS THERE WAS TRYING TO MANAGE A CRISIS AND NOT ONLY FOR THE IMMEDIATE BUT. IN THE EVENT THINGS HAPPENED. THINKING JAW. SO I JUST WANT TO END ON ON THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE WAS. BY SAYING THAT WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE THERE WERE NO LIVES LOST. AND THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT HAD TO EVACUATE THEIR HOMES IN THAT THIS WAS A VERY TERRIFYING EXPERIENCE FOR THEM. AND HAVING GONE THROUGH SEVERAL OF THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS ESPECIALLY EARLY ON NOW I RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS WAS AN ORDEAL. FOR FOLKS. IN THE CITY OF OROVILLE THE DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES BUT AGAIN WE FEEL VERY FORTUNATE THAT THERE WERE NO LIGHTS LOST IN IN. THAT PARTICULAR INCIDENT SO. QUj SO GUT NEXT SLIDEIS OF PHOTO ON TAKEN. TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AND IT'S IT'S HERE TO ILLUSTRATE. THE AMOUNT OF DEBRIS THAT ENDED UP IN THE DIVERSION POOL AND HOW IT IN LOOKING AT THIS YOU COULD. SEE HOW WATER WOULD BEGIN TO BACK UP BEHIND THAT IN THE POWER PLANT WOULD BE OFF TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THIS PARTICULAR. PHOTO SO I'M. AGAIN IS IS JILL MENTIONED BALANCING RISK THERE WERE A LOT OF FACTORS THAT WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THIS VOTERS JUST ILLUSTRATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEBRIS THAT ENDED UP IN THE DIVERSION PULL WAS QUITE EXTENSIVE TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE EVENT. OF I'M I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'D LEAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR MY. COLLEAGUES IN THE TABLE TO DO THEIR PRESENTATIONS ARE I'M ANSWER QUESTIONS SO I'M GONNA MOVE TO THE NEXT SLIDE WHICH IS THE EMERGENCY RECOVERY PLAN. AND WITH THIS SLIDE REALLY WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS TO SUMMARIZE. EARLY ON WHAT THE KEY OBJECTIVES WERE IN OUR EMERGENCY RECOVERY PANNING AND THEY'RE JUST LISTED HERE AS YOU CAN SEE INSURING PUBLIC SAFETY IS NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST. AND BY DO IN DOING THAT ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF THE OROVILLE DAM THE ASSOCIATED FACILITIES pTOWARDS US LAST YEAR WE HAVE A NOVEMBER HAD IN NOVEMBER ONE. MILESTONE DATE TO GET THE MAIN SPILLWAY TO A PLACE WHERE IT COULD. TAKE FLOWS FROM THE. FEATHER RIVER. AT ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CFS THROUGH THE WINTER SEASON WE MET THAT MILESTONE. A THAT WAS DEFINITELY R. NUMBER ONE ONE OF OUR NUMBER ONE. NICHOLS THROUGH THIS LAST YEAR AND A VERY ACCELERATED RATE AND TO ACHIEVE THAT. THE SECOND GOAL WAS TO HOPE SORRY THAT WAS THE SECOND GOING MERGE THEM. AND THE LAST ONE ON HERE'S HAVING TO DO WITH THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY SO ALSO PART OF OUR RECOVERY PLANNING OVER THE LAST YEAR WAS TO BUILD A SEE CAN'T CUT OFF WALL. IN TO THE BASE AT DOWN THE SWORD DOWN HILL A BIT FROM THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY SILL SO THAT. SHOULD WE HAVE TO USE IT THAT IS NOT THE INTENTION ON THE SEASON BUT SHOULD THAT OCCUR THIS CONCRETE WALL GOES DOWN INTO THE FOUNDATION AND WOULD STOP EROSION FROM COMING BACK UP THE HILL SO ARE TO THOSE WORDS. PRIMARY GOALS AND THE NEXT SERIES OF PHOTOS GIVE YOU A SENSEOF SOME OF THE CONSTRUCTION THAT WENT ON OVER THE YEAR SO THAT NEXT THREE SLIDES IF YOU WILL. GIVE YOU A SENSE OF OF THE TYPE OF WORK THE SCALE OF WORK TOM. AND THE A FIGURE. THAT ACTUALLY ILLUSTRATES THE MAIN SPILLWAYS AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN TERMS OF INCURRING DEBTS WITH. AND SO ON. HOME DURING CONSTRUCTION I WOULD I WANTED TO MENTION THAT ALL THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS OVER THIS LAST YEAR WE HAVE WORKED OBVIOUSLY VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR CONTRACTOR. BUT ALSO WITH OUR REGULATORY ENTITIES BOTH THE FEDERAL AND ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION. THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE BOARD OF CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE BEEN WITH US THROUGH THE ENTIRE PROCESS. LOOKING AT THE DESIGN LOOKING AT CONSTRUCTION OFFERING US A RECOMMENDATIONS REVIEWING THINGS ADVICE THAT WE'VE INCORPORATED AND BEEN. VERY CLOSELY IN COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS WE'VE ALSO COORDINATED VERY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AS WE'VE MOVED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. AND IN FACT THROUGH. ALL OF THESE ENTITIES WE RECEIVED SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY INDIVIDUAL COMMENTS THAT ASSISTED US IN OUR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. OKAY AND THEN I'M GONNA JUMP TO DISLIKE HERE WHICH IS THE SORT OF A SERIES OF. PHOTOGRAPHS THAT GO FROM MAY THROUGH NOVEMBER FIRST FIRST THAT SHOW THE PROGRESS OF CONSTRUCTION. AS I MENTIONED MAY AND NOVEMBER FIRST WAS A MAJOR MILESTONE AND WE ACHIEVE THE ABILITY TO PASS A HUNDRED THOUSAND CUBIC FEET PER SECOND OF FLOW OVER THE MAIN SPILLWAY. THROUGH THIS WINTER AND SPRING HOME. SEASON. IT'S IMPORTANT I THINK TO AND I FLEW TO THIS BUT TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE AMOUNT OF DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS IT WITH THEIR CONSULTANTS IN OUTSIDE EXPERTISE HAS. COMPLETED THIS LAST YEAR ERECTION REALLY IN ABOUT SIX MONTHS IS UNPRECEDENTED THIS IS USUALLY MORE OF A FIVE YEAR IRISH PROCESS BETWEEN DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. ON THOSE THAT'S MORE NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THIS OBVIOUSLY WAS. HUGE ENDEAVOR THAT TIME WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE MET THE FIRST MAJOR MILESTONE. BUT THE WORK IS NOT COMPLETE TWENTY EIGHTEEN LOOKS EVERY BIT AS BUSY. ON A WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO IN TERMS OF GETTING THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. REPAIRS DONE A HAND FINISHING REPAIRS NEEDED TO THE MAIN SPILLWAY. BECAUSE THE NEXT SLIDE IS THE A GRAPHIC OF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY A GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THAT UNDERGROUND CUT OFF WALL WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. AND THE AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS TO PREVENT UPHILL OR HAD CUTTING EROSION SHOULD WE NEED TO USE THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY THE SEASON. AND THEN MY LAST SLIDE IS A QUOTE FROM THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAM REPORTS AND I GUESS I WOULD READ IT THOUGH THAT WE SENSIBLE AWKWARD BUT FOUND LITTLE. TEA AT MY LAST POINT I SUPPOSE. SO THE QUOTE IS THE FACT THAT THIS INCIDENT HAPPENED TO THE OWNER OF THE TALLEST DAM IN THE UNITED STATES. UNDER REGULATION OF A FEDERAL AGENCY WITH REPEATED EVALUATION BY REPUTABLE OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS. IS A STATE IN A STATE WITH THE LEADING DAM SAFETY REGULATORY PROGRAM IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED IN DIEM SAFETY. CHALLENGING CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS ON WHAT CONSTITUTES BEST PRACTICE IN OUR INDUSTRY IS OVERDUE. AND SO WE WANTED TO TO POINT OUT TO THIS QUOTE AGAIN WERE APPRECIATIVE OF THE WORK THAT FORENSIC TEAM HAS DONE BUT I THINK THIS TRULY IS A HOME THERE ARE MANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED. FROM WHAT HAPPENED LAST FEBRUARY THE DEPARTMENT IS TAKING. THE FINDINGS IN THE REPORT VERY SERIOUSLY WE HAVE BEGIN TO MAKE CHANGES WILL TALK ABOUT THOSE THERE ARE MORE TO COME. BUT THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE I THINK NEEDS TO WE NEED TO COLLECTIVELY MOVE THIS FORWARD WITH THE INFORMATION WE HAVE AT HAND. SO WITH THAT I THINK I AM DONE FOR NOW ENDS DO WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE THINGS OVER JUST HARD BUT YOU COULDN'T GIVE PRESENTATIONS WELL WE'RE GONNA. WE'LL GO TO MR OKAY RISK MISPRINTS IT BUT I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION AND THEN I COULDN'T WAIT TO QUESTIONS AT THE END BUT. YOU READ THAT LAST QUOTE SO. ARE WE AWAKE. WE ARE WEAK. DIFFERENT. BUT THANK YOU ARE GOOD MORNING HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE A. GREEN FOLDER THERE WITH. WITH A COPY OF THE MAIN REPORT. AS WELL AS A COPY OF. SOME TALKING POINTS THAT I PUT TOGETHER TO SPEAK WITH YOU THIS MORNING. THAT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS MORNING TO TALK WITH YOU. THOUGHT IT WAS A. AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS IT WAS HONORED TO BE ASKED TO LEAD THIS OF FORENSIC INVESTIGATION TEAM ON SOMETHING THAT'S ARE SO IMPORTANT NOT JUST TO. TO CALIFORNIA AND TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT. BUT TO THE ARE DAM SAFETY INDUSTRY WHICH IS UP INDUSTRY I'VE BEEN A PART OF FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS NOW. AND LOCAL TELL YOU THAT OUR OUR TEAM OF SIX PEOPLE. REALLY TOOK THIS ON. FEELING A PROFESSIONAL DUTY TO DO THIS AS THOROUGHLY AND COMPLETELY UNFAIRLY AS WE COULD. AYE AND THAT'S THE WAY WE CHOSE TO DO TO DO OUR SCI MED AND HOPE THAT WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT. THE. THE. ONE THING I'VE LEARNED WORKING MY FRIENDS OF THE COURT ENGINEERS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS IS IN ALL THEIR PRESENTATIONS THEY REQUIRE THE PRESENTERS TO GIVE THE BOTTOM LINE UP FRONT. SORT OF. WHAT WHAT ARE WE REALLY LEARNED OUT OF THIS THING AND AND I TOOK A QUOTE OUT OF? THE SUMMARY OF OUR REPORT. WHICH WAS THAT THE INCIDENT WAS CAUSED BY A LONG TERM SYSTEMIC FAILURE. OF THE D. W. OUR REGULATORY AND GENERAL INDUSTRY PRACTICES AND I WAS VERY CAREFULLY PUT TOGETHER THAT IT'S THE IT'S THE SYSTEM AND IT'S NOT JUST THE W. ARE IT'S ITS DEBUT ARE THE REGULATORS. OF THE CONSULTANTS WHO WERE WORKING IN S. EVERYONE AND A HAND IN THIS EVERITT A LOT OF PEOPLE TOUCH THIS PROJECT SO. IT INVOLVED A LOT OF PEOPLE SO IS A FAILURE OF OF THAT. PRACTICE TO RECOGNIZE AND ADDRESS WHAT WERE INHERENT SPILLWAY DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION WEAKNESSES POOR BEDROCK QUALITY. AND TERRY DETERIORATED SERVICE SPILLWAYS SHOOT CONDITIONS. AND BECAUSE OF THAT SORT OF BROUGHT EVERYBODY TOUCHING IT WE REALLY CAN'T REASONABLY BLAME A SINGLE ORGANIZATION OR SINGLE INDIVIDUAL. AND AIR THAT THAT IT'S NOT. ALWAYS SATISFYING TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO FIND SOMEONE OR SOME ORGANIZATION THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS. BUT BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE TOUCHED IT WE ALL TO SOME DEGREE SHARE THE BLAME FOR THIS THING. AND AS AN INDUSTRY. IT LIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES A WE NEED TO LEARN FROM FROM WHAT HAPPENED IF I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE EVERY TIME THERE WAS AN AIRLINE CRASH OR IN THEIR LIGHT INCIDENT. THEY LOOK AT IT AND THEY LEARN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IN THIS WE HOPE. WE CAN WE CAN HELP DO I WAS VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE A AN EXCELLENT TEAM. TO DO THIS INVESTIGATION AND I MYSELF I I WAS THE LEADER OF THE TEAM. AND MY BACKGROUND IS GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING BUT I HAVE A BROADER EXPERIENCE IN DAM SAFETY AND DAM DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION. SO AND KNOWLEDGEABLE OF SPILLWAYS AND HYDRAULICS IN AND OTHER THINGS ALL THE MIKE SPECIAL EXPERTISE IS IN GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING. OR I'LL BE. AS A DRUG STRUCTURE ENGINEER AND OUR FINEST SERVED ON IT ASSOCIATIONS STATE DAM SAFETY OFFICIALS COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN PUTTING TOGETHER OVER THE LAST DECADE OR SO PROTOCOLS WERE INVESTIGATING INCIDENTS. AND FAILURES OF DAMS AND PARTICULARLY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE HUMAN FACTORS HELP HUMAN ORGANIZATIONS PLAY INTO THESE THINGS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SAID BY OTHERS IN ITS TRUE. THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PHYSICAL CAUSES BUT THE PHYSICAL CAUSES. TYPICALLY HAVE NOT CREATED THEMSELVES. HUMANS HAVE CREATED THE STRUCTURES THAT THE PRODUCERS PHYSICAL CAUSES. PETER DICKSON IS AN ENGINEERING GEOLOGIST WHO UP HAS WORKED ALL OVER THE WORLD ON DAMS AND AND SPILLWAYS. HENRY FLP HANK FALVEY IS AN INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HYDRAULIC. ENGINEER RETIRED FROM THE BUREAU OF RECLAMATION AND AN INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANT. A STEVEN RIGBY IS CURRENTLY THE DIRECTOR OF DAM SAFETY OF BC HYDRO ANOTHER LARGE DAM OWNER. WITH THAT PROJECTS NOT DISSIMILAR TO OROVILLE AND STEVENS. PROSPECTIVE THAT HELPED US A LOT WAS <u><i>AN DAM SAFETY PROGRAM</i></u> AND ALSO ON THE HUMAN FACTORS ASIDE AND IN ADDITION WE'RE FORTUNES STEVENS IN JAIL LOGICAL ENGINEER SO HE WAS ABLE TO. SUPPLEMENT WHAT PETER DIXON WAS DOING AND LASTLY. BUT NOT LEAST JOHN TROJAN OWSKI WHO'S RETIRED FROM PUREXML NATION AND SPENT HIS CAREER YOUR RECLAMATION IN HYDRAULIC STRUCTURES DESIGNED EVALUATION. AND JOHN WAS ONE OF THE KEY MEMBERS WHO DEVELOPED THE BUREAU RECLAMATIONS PROTOCOLS FOR EVALUATING SPILLWAY FAILURE MODES AND WHAT YOU MIGHT DO TO TO TAKE CARE OF ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE CONCERN WAS SPILLWAYS SO WAS. AN EXCELLENT TEAM A LOT OF GOOD DEBATE AND GOOD INTERACTION AND UP. AND AND WHO WAS A WONDERFUL GROUP TO WORK WITH. CAUGHT IN VERY DEDICATED VERY HARD WORKING. R. METHODOLOGY. WE REVIEWED A LOT OF INFORMATION AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION TO REVIEW AND WE NOTE IN THE REPORT THAT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE VOLUME OF INFORMATION AND THE WAY IT IS CURRENTLY ORGANIZED. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE'S SOME PERTINENT INFORMATION THAT ESCAPED OUR ATTENTION OR DIDN'T COME TO OUR ATTENTION WE TRIED THIS BEST WE COULD DO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN BUT IT'S POSSIBLE IT DID. A WE DID HAVE A LIMITED NUMBER OF SITE VISITS AT THE TIME OUR WORK STARTED IN APRIL. IDEA BR WAS ACTUALLY GETTING READY TO BEGIN THE REPAIR WORK SO. WE'D WE DID VISIT THE SITE RIGHT AWAY IN APRIL AND ONE OF OUR MEMBERS OF. PETER DIXON VISITED DURING SOME OF THE DEMOLITION AND SOME OF THE INVESTIGATION WORK WHERE WE ACTUALLY WOULD. CUT OUT SOME LARGE PIECES OF CONCRETE LIFT THEM UP SEE WHAT WAS UNDERNEATH THAT SEE WITH THAT CONCRETE LOOK LIKE PETER WAS ON SITE DURING THAT WORK. WE INTERVIEWED A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE OF OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS AYE EACH ONE OF THEM TYPICALLY AT LEAST AN HOUR SOME OF THEM WERE MORE THAN AN HOUR IN SOME OF THOSE FOLKS WE. INTERVIEWED FOR. A MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS AND. WE WE TRIED TO. INTERVIEW A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE WE INTERVIEWED INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT. WE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE WHO CAME FORWARD WITH INFORMATION THAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE USEFUL TO US. BUT THEN WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE ORGANIZATION OF D. W. ARE OF BOTH TO THE ART BUT DIVISION ENGINEERING OPERATION MAINTENANCE AND DO SO DIEM WE. ORGANIZATIONS ARE AND WE PICKED PEOPLE WITHIN VARIOUS LEVELS AND WE ASK THEM TO INTERVIEW SO WE CAN GET A CROSS SECTION OF THAT ORGANIZATIONS. AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION ANYONE WE ASKED INTERVIEW WAS HAPPY TO INTERVIEW AND AND COME FORWARD. WE SUGGESTED SOME INVESTIGATIONS ANALYSIS THE D. W. ARE EITHER DID ITSELF OR HAD DONE BY CONTRACTORS AND WE DID SOME OF OUR OWN INDEPENDENT ALICE'S. A WE REVIEW DESIGN PRACTICES OF THE NINETEEN SIXTIES I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT MORE IN A MOMENT. WE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC SET UP A MAILBOX INDEPENDENT FROM D. W. ARE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO DO OUR WORK. INDEPENDENT FTW R. AND IN WE DID INDEED DO THAT. WE DO W. ARE SUPPORTED US IN PROVIDING INFORMATION AND ARRANGING OF FOR INTERVIEWS AND AND MANY ASPECTS SUPPORTED US BUT OUR WORK WAS INDEPENDENT. AND EVEN TO THE DEGREE THAT THE REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED DWI R. DID NOT SEE THAT REPORT INTO IT WAS COMPLETED WE DID BRIEF THEM LAST THURSDAY BUT THE REPORT THAT WE BRIEFED THEM ON. WAS EXACTLY THE SAME REPORT THAT WAS LEAKED RELEASED ON FRIDAY SO THERE WAS NO INPUT THAT REPORT FROM FROM GW R. WAS A FULL INDEPENDENT EVALUATION. WE DID ALSO COMPLETE SOME SURVEYS MDW R. WINE OF DWI R. DAM SAFETY OF PERSONNEL PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM. AND ANOTHER ONE. BROADER CRUSTY W. ARE TRYING TO ACQUIRE LOUBET THAT THE ORGANIZATION A D. W. OUR IN HOUSE IT FUNCTIONING AS AN AGENCY IN WATER MIGHT BE ISSUES WITHIN AT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WITH ALL OF OUR INTERVIEWS IN THE SURVEYS IS WE ASSURED R. UP FOLKS WE'RE TALKING TO. THAT WE WOULD NOT PUBLICLY IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS IN THE REPORTING WE WOULD NOT SHARE THEIR NAMES THAT WAS CONFIDENTIAL BETWEEN THEM AND US. IN LESS A CORD OR SOME LEGAL ENTITY CAME FORWARD AND COMPELLED US. SO WE WE WANTED THEM TO BE FRANK AND FORTHCOMING AND WE WE PROVIDED THAT ASSURANCE TO THEM. I AND THEN WE HAD A NUMBER OF WORKING SESSIONS AMONGST OUR GROUP BECAUSE AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHEN YOU START TO LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION. YOU COME AWAY WITH DIFFERENT IMPRESSIONS AND YOU HAVE TO TALK THOSE THROUGH AND COME TO A COMMON CONSENSUS ON WHAT WE AS A GROUP THINK. SOMETIMES YOU CAN SEE WHAT HAPPENED YOU SEE SOME INFORMATION AND YOU AB ONE INTERPRETATION OF IT SOMEBODY ELSE ON THE TEAM MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT WHEN IT WE TALKED AT THROUGH IN. AND CAME TO A CONSENSUS TO I CAN TELL YOU CONFIDENTLY THAT REPORT IS A CONSENSUS THAT ALL SIX MEMBERS STAND BEHIND. VERY BRIEFLY FOR SOME OF THE CONTENT OF THE REPORT OF THE WHAT HAPPENED THIS IS THE PHYSICS OF WHAT HAPPENED. THIS IS THE FIFTH SLIDE IN IN THE PACKET THAT WAS GIVEN TO YOU. UP WITH REGARD TO THE SERVICE BILL WAY. YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THIS AND PREVIOUSLY BUT WHAT WE BELIEVE HAPPENED THIS IS SOMEWHERE IN THIS. AREA OF. BETWEEN THIRTY FOUR PLUS ZERO ZERO AND THIRTY THREE PLUS ZERO ZERO THAT SHOWN ON THAT FIGURE. SOMEWHERE WITHIN THAT AREA A SECTION OF THE CONCRETE SHOOTS LAB WAS LIFTED UP. BY PRESSURE WATER PRESSURE UNDERNEATH OF IT BEING GREATER THAN THE RESISTANCE THAT THAT SECTION OUT AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN A SMALL SECTION. IT COULD HAVE BEEN A COUPLE FEET BY A COUPLE FEET IT COULD HAVE BEEN LARGER. BUT ONCE IT LIFTED WHAT HAPPENS IS WHEN YOU HAVE A SECTION OF SLAB THAT LIFTS INTO. INTO HIGH FULL OF THEIR VERY QUICKLY FLOWING WATER LIKE ELLEN THE SHOOT THAT WATER HITS. THAT FACE THE CONCRETE AND THE CONCRETE STOPS THE WATER AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT KINETIC ENERGY OF THE VELOCITY THE WATER THEN GETS TURNED INTO PRESSURE. THAT PRESSURE GROWS UNDERNEATH THE SLAB AND JUST INCREASES THE PRESSURE AND CONTINUES TO LIFT IT UP. SO IT LIFTED UP AND WHAT HAPPENED IS WHEN IT LIFTED UP THE FOUNDATION IN THIS AREA WAS STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK POP POSSIBLY EVEN SOIL LIKE MATERIAL. AND AS SOON AS THAT CHUNK OF SLAB WAS GONE IN THAT HIGH VELOCITY FLOW HITS THAT MATERIAL RICHES STARTS TO A ROAD. AND THEN IT JUST GOES OUT OF CONTROL INTO ROADS AND REMOVE SLABS AND WE CREATED THE WHOLE THAT WE SAW THERE SO THAT'S THAT THE PHYSICS OF WHAT HAPPENED WE BELIEVE IN THE SERVICE BUT WAY. THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY EVERYONE GOT TO WATCH THAT HAPPEN. AND A WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS WHEN THE WATER BEGAN TO FLOW OVER THE. THE HILLSIDE DOWNSTREAM OF THE CONCRETE STRUCTURES. IT FOUND PLACES WHERE THERE WAS STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK. TO DEPP'S GREATER THAN A FEW FEET AND IT STARTED TO A ROAD DOES IT WAS PROBABLY AIDED BY. A CONCENTRATIONS IN TOPOGRAPHY AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE ROADS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD CONCENTRATE THAT FLOW AND CONCENTRATE THE EROSIVE FORCES. THOSE AREAS OF STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK HAPPEN TO BE ORIENTED IN A WAY THAT WHEN IT STARTED TO ROAD THEY BEGAN MOVING TOWARDS THE SPILLWAY AND AS THEY MOVE TOWARDS THIS BILL WHEN THEY MOVE. RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND THE. THE DECISION TO TO EVACUATE CERTAINLY IN OUR VIEW WAS A PRUDENT ONE AT THAT POINT TIME THERE WAS NO CHOICE BUT TO MAKE. THAT DECISION IN THE THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY. ARE MOVING ON TO THE THE SIX LIED. VOTES TITLED WHY THE INCIDENT HAPPENED SERVICE SPILLWAY. IT MIGHT ALSO BE TITLED. COME WHY DID WE NOT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE IT REALLY IS HIS INTO THE QUESTION OF WHY DID WE NOT KNOW AHEAD OF TIME THIS THIS IS HAPPENING. AND AND THE Y.. HAD IT HAPPENED. FROM THE HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL SIDE IS THAT WE. AS WE DUG INTO THIS WE FOUND IS IS HAS CONSTRUCTED THAT SPILLWAYS SHOOT. WAS INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS FOUNDATION AND HYDRAULIC CONDITIONS THE HYDRAULIC CONDITIONS BEING THE VERY HIGH VELOCITY FLOWS OF WATER. THE FOUNDATION BEING THAT IN PLACES RATHER THAN BEING CONSTRUCTED ON. A RELATIVELY SOUND ROCK WHICH WITH THE DESIGNERS INTENT IT ENDED UP BEING CONSTRUCTED ON STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK. OVER IN PARTICULAR IN THE AREA WHERE THE SHOOT FAILED. THE SO THE SLAB HAD FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THERE WERE CRACKS. OVER TOP OF THE DRAINS UNDER THE SLAB BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE DRAINS. THE IN THE CONCRETE SECTION ABOVE THE THE SLAPPING AS THE SLABS OCT CURED AFTER BEING PLACED CRACKS DEVELOPED OVER THOSE THAT DRAINS IN THOSE CRACKS EXTENDED ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE CONCRETE SECTION DOWN TO THE DRAIN. SO THEY ALLOWED WATER TO ENTER. IN ADDITION THE. THE JOINTS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PANELS OF THE SLAB DID NOT HAVE WATER STOPS. WHICH IS SOMETHING WE COMMONLY DO TODAY SO THIS WOULD BE A RUBBER. GASKET IF YOU LIKE ACROSS THE JOINTS THAT WATER COULDN'T PENETRATE SO THOSE JOINTS WERE DID NOT HAVE THAT'S WATER CA GOING THROUGH THE JOINTS. SO AS A RESULT. WHENEVER THIS BILL WE OPERATED THOSE UNDER DRAINS WOULD FLOW IN THAT FLOW A LOT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED. TO. TO COLLECT MINIMAL GROUNDWATER THAT HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED DURING INVESTIGATIONS BUT INSTEAD THEY WERE COLLECTING THIS WATER COMING THROUGH THE CHUTE. AND THAT WAS OBSERVED AGAIN FIRST TIME THIS BILL WE OPERATED NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. QUESTION WAS RAISED ABOUT IS THIS NORMAL DISTRICT WE PLEA SAW DOCUMENT THAT SAID. DESIGNERS ARE LOOK AT THIS AND WE DIDN'T SEE ANY FOLLOW UP TO THAT THERE WAS NO INDICATION THAT SOMEONE LOOKED AT IT SAID YES IT'S OKAY SOMEONE LOOKED AT ITS IT NOW TO PROBLEM IT JUST. IT WAS SO THE ONE DOCUMENTS THAT LOOK AT IT AND NOTHING FURTHER AND THEN WHAT SEEMS TO HAVE HAPPENED IS. THAT. THE CRACKS IN THE BRAIN FLOWS BECAME NORMALIZED. THERE'S A CONCEPT WE TALK ABOUT IT ACTUALLY DEVELOPED FROM THE. THE SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER DISASTER A NORMALISATION THE DEVIANTS WHERE SPACE SHUTTLE CHALLENGER IF YOU REMEMBER. THERE WAS WHEN THEY WENT BACK AND LOOKED THERE WAS A LOT OF QUESTION ABOUT THE O. RINGS THAT ULTIMATELY FAILED YEARS BEFORE THAT FAILURE BUT THEY CONTINUED TO HAVE LUNCH AFTER LAUNCH THAT WORKED. AND EVEN THOUGH THE O. RINGS WERE WORKING IT WAS A. DEPARTURE FROM WHAT WAS EXPECTED. BECAME ACCEPTED AS NORMAL AND ULTIMATELY LED TO THE CHALLENGER IN THIS CASE. THESE CRACKS IN THOSE FLOWS BECAME ACCEPTED AS NORMAL AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE EXPECTATION REPORTS THEY NOTE THE CRACKS ARE THERE THE DURING FLOWS IT THERE. BUT THERE'S NO. COMMENT OR CONCERN AS TO WHAT WHAT THE WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THEM. SUBSEQUENT SECTIONS EVALUATIONS DIDN'T IDENTIFY. AND THEN BECAUSE IT WASN'T IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS DEFECT THE REPAIRS TENDED TO BE RELATIVELY SHALL REPAIRS THAT JUST RESTORED. THE SURFACE OF THE SLAB TO A SMOOTH UNIFORM SURFACE RATHER THAN RECOGNIZING THAT THERE WAS THIS INHERENT PROBLEM. A WITH THE SLAP IN WHICH FOUNDATION TO THE SLAB. SO THOSE ARE THE WHY IT HAPPENED WITH THE THE SERVICE BILL WAY. THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. WHAT THE BIGGEST THING THAT WE POINT OUT THERE IS THAT THE? OVER TIME THE GEOLOGY OF THE HILLSIDE REALLY BECAME MISS UNDERSTOOD. A WHEN WE GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE GEOLOGY REPORTS FROM THE DESIGN PERIOD NINETEEN SIXTY TO NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR. WE SEE DRILL HOLE LOGS AND WE SEE A THE TEXT IN THE REPORTS THAT INDICATE THAT THAT HILLSIDE ALTHOUGH IT'S THE FEEBLE LIGHT ROCK THAT HAS A LOT OF GOOD QUALITY ROCK. IT ALSO HAS SOME AREAS OF DEEPER STRONGLY WEATHERED ROCK. UP TO TEN TEN FEET TWENTY FEET TENS OF FEET. INTO THE ROCK OF THAT'S IN THOSE FIRST COUPLE OF REPORTS THAT THE REPORT THAT WAS DONE RIGHT AFTER CONSTRUCTION THE GEOLOGY REPORT. IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE DRILL HOLES. AND THEN IT. IT FURTHER. HAS SOME STATEMENTS THAT GIVE AN IMPRESSION THAT THE HILLSIDES FEES AWFULLY GOOD. AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER TIME APPARENTLY IS THAT. BETTER INTERPRETATION OF THE HILLSIDE IS WHAT. COLLECTIVELY GOT INTO THE MINDS OF OF THE FOLKS WHO WERE MANAGING THE PROJECT IN THE HILLSIDE WAS THOUGHT OF THOUGHT TO BE VERY GOOD. A THE BEST EXAMPLES OF THAT ARE IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. THERE WAS A MEMO ON THAT WAS WRITTEN IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP DURING THE FOR RELICENSING PROCESS. AND THAT PRODUCE SEEMS PRETTY STRONG LANGUAGE CHARACTERIZES THE ROCK. IN THE HILLSIDE DOWNSTREAM OF THE MERCY SPILLWAY AS BEING VERY GOOD QUALITY. ESSENTIALLY EROSION RESISTANT ROCK IT AT THE SAME TIME IT INCLUDED BORE HOLES THAT WERE. WHERE THE CREST STRUCTURE IS IN THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY BUT NONE THE LESS SOME OF THOSE BORE HOLE DID SHOW WEATHERED ROCK TO SIGNIFICANT DEPP'S? SO THE DATA EVEN IT TAX THE MEMO SORT OF DID NOT WAS NOT CONGRUENT. WITHOUT WITH WHAT WAS DONE THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO FOR FOR DID NOT OBJECT TO IT. AND IT WENT FORWARD THERE WAS ANOTHER MEMO ISSUED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. THAT WAS LOOKING AT THE QUESTION HOW MUCH MATERIAL MIGHT A ROAD INTO THE RIVER IF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY OPERATED. THAT ONE. AGAIN CONCLUDED. REFERENCE DO THOUSAND FIVE MEMO AND CONCLUDED. THAT IT WOULD BE THREE TO FOUR FEET OF SOIL AND ROCK WITH A ROAD AND THEN WE HIT NOT A RELIABLE MATERIAL ON IT WOULD STOP. BUT IT IN IT ALSO INCLUDED A TABLE OF SEVERAL OF THESE DRILL HOLES IN WITHIN THE TABLE ARE NUMBERED DRILL HOLES THAT SHOW. WHETHER PROCTOR GREATER DEPTH SO DOES TO. DESPITE HAVING DATA WITHIN THEM REACH A CONCLUSION THAT IS A LITTLE HARD TO SUPPORT. WE DO TALK IN THE REPORT A BIT ABOUT THE RISK BALLOTS IN THE TRADE OFFS AND JUDGMENTS DURING THE EVENT. AND I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN AS AS WE SAY IN THE REPORT. ITSELF THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CRITICIZE THE DECISION MAKERS I'VE AT LEAST THREE TIMES IN MY CAREER I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DAM INCIDENTS IN EMERGENCIES. AND I KNOW IT'S A SITUATION IT'S A STRESSFUL SITUATION YOU HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION COMING AT YOU FROM DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. YOU MAKE THE BEST JUDGMENT THAT YOU CAN AT THE TIME AND I WAS ACTUALLY ASK A QUESTION. ON THIS. THAT WOULD HE DO I KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT IF I WERE IN THAT ROOM I WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION TO USE THE SPILLWAY MORE AND DON'T TAKE LESS OF A CHANCE OF OPERATING EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. AND I CAN'T TELL YOU I WOULD DO THAT BECAUSE I WASN'T IN THAT ROOM AND YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE ROOM TO REALLY KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO POINT OUT HERE. IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFORMATION THERE WAS INFORMATION AVAILABLE THAT MIGHT HAVE LED YOU TO A REASONABLE TO A DIFFERENT DECISION WITH A REASONABLE BASIS. TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE FUTURE AND HOW CAN WE PERHAPS COMMUNICATE BETTER DURING THESE THESE EMERGENCIES. SO WITHOUT WHAT DID WE LEARN HOW WE SUGGEST IN THE REPORT SOME LESSONS TO BE LEARNED ABOUT FOR SOME PRETTY W. ARE IN SOME FOR INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE. SPECIFICALLY FOR D. W. ARE. I'M WE BELIEVED TO BE OUR NEEDS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON. MATURING IT'S DAM SAFETY CULTURE AND ORGANIZATION AND THEM CAN IMPROVE THE PRIORITY WITHIN THE W. ARE ON THE DAM SAFETY. WE. THE THE ORGANIZATION HAS A DAM SAFETY PROGRAM WE ASK IN A NUMBER OF OUR INTERVIEWS WHO IS THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE AT GW R.. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DAM SAFETY AND WE WOULD GET DIFFERENT ANSWERS SO WHEN YOU DIFFERENT ANSWERS THAT MEANS THE ORGANIZATIONS A WHOLE DOESN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS? SO THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE AN INDIVIDUAL THAT THE ORGANIZATION KNOWS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. AND THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO BE BRIEFED BY THE DAM SAFETY PROFESSIONALS THE CHIEF DAM SAFETY OFFICER ENGINEER IN THIS CASE ON A REGULAR BASIS WHAT ARE ISSUES WHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING. pORGANIZATION HAS ONLY SO MUCH MONEY AND HAS TO BALANCE ITS DIFFERENT PRIORITIES OBJECTIVES BUT TO BE SURE THE DAM SAFETY GETS ITS APPROPRIATE. VOICE IN THAT DECISION WHEN THINGS ARE BEING MADE. BOB WE'VE FEEL THERE WAS SOME OVER CONFIDENCE AND COMPLACENCY. THAT THE LEGEND IS THAT. STATE WATER PROJECT WAS WAS WAS BUILT A BEST BEST PRACTICES AT THE TIME. AND. IT'S WAS THAT THERE'S LITTLE THAT THAT THAT STUFF IS REALLY GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE WE DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT IT WELL. NAY WE NEED TO BE A BIT MORE CRITICAL THAT MORE QUESTIONING OF WORRY ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. WE THINK THEY'D SOME NEED TO ADDRESS INSULARITY IN THE ORGANIZATION A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE W. ARE SPEND THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS WITHIN ONE ORGANIZATION AND THAT'S NOT FUNDAMENTALLY PROBLEM THERE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO THAT TOO. BUT YOU NEED TO REACH OUT AND LEARN FROM WHAT OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR BUSINESS OR DOING. AND CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CREATES A BIT OF A CHALLENGE WITH THAT FOR APPROVALS TO GO OUT OF STATE FOR TRAINING AND. AND CONFERENCES WHERE THAT INFORMATION EXCHANGES SO. IT PERHAPS LOOK TO YOU TO ARE THERE WAYS THAT THERE COULD BE RELIEF FOR THE FOR DWI TO BE ABLE DO THAT MORE EASILY. AND THEN DELIVERY ARE COULD ALSO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES IN PERHAPS BRINGING TRAINING IN THE STATES WOULD REACH OUT AND LEARN MORE WITH OUR BUSINESS IS DOING. DWI NEEDS TO WORK TO BUILD A APPROPRIATE SIZE COMPOSITION EXPERTISE OF TECHNICAL STAFF INVOLVED IN DAM SAFETY. AND DAM ENGINEERING AND AGAIN THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN HELP WITH BECAUSE. BUT WE HEARD A LOT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONSTRAINTS ON D. W. ARE HIRING NUMBERS OF POSITIONS. AND AN ABILITY TO ELEVATE PEOPLE TO SENIOR POSITIONS AS TECHNICAL EXPERTS NOT AS MANAGERS. AND SOME HELP WITH THAT WITH WITH THOSE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES WOULD BE GOOD. AND THEN ALSO ON EMPTY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM COULD BE IMPROVED WEEKS WE HAD STRUGGLED WITH FINDING INFORMATION AND AND IF. DATA BR COULD REALLY TAKE ON HOW CAN WE HAVE A STATE OF THE PRACTICE. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR OUR DAM SAFETY INFORMATION. OUR INDUSTRY ALSO HAS A LOT OF LESSONS TO LEARN. ONE BEING. THE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE DWI R. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO D. W. ARE IF I WERE GOING TO HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF OTHER OR A DANCE TONY ORGANIZATIONS I PROBABLY MAKE THE SAME RECOMMENDATION. IT'S NOT THE D. W. OURS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PACK THERE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE THERE A LOT OF THEM. THERE LIKE THAT THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE BETTER BUT THEY'RE A LOT THERE RIGHT THERE WITH THEM. AND AND PART OF THAT IS THIS TOP DOWN DAM SAFETY CULTURE THAT I MENTIONED REALLY HAVE A SENIOR EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBLE HAVE HIM. GET THE PROPERTY INFORMATION. OF PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS ARE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM IN THE UNITED STATES IS IN LARGE PART DRIVEN BY GOING OUT ANNUALLY IN LOOKING AT THAT THE DAM AND SEEING WE SEE ANY ISSUES. THE ISSUES HERE WERE UNDER THE SLAB AND ONCE YOU HAVE DECIDED THAT. THE CRACKS IN THE DRAIN FLOWS WERE NOT THEY WERE NORMAL THAT THEY WERE NOT ABNORMAL PROBLEMS. THERE VISUAL INSPECTION WOULD YOU SHOW YOU ANYTHING YOU HAD TO DO WHAT'S NEXT IN THE BULLET THERE IS TO GO BACK AND DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW DIG INTO THE DESIGN DIGGING TO THE CONSTRUCTION RECORDS. IDENTIFY THOSE INHERENT DEFECTS THAT WERE BUILT IN AT THE BEGINNING. AND THEN. A WHAT CAN HAPPEN ON A PROJECT LIKE OROVILLE YOU'VE GOT A SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY FOOT EMBANKMENT DAM. OVER THERE WHEN YOU'RE DOING REVIEWS IT TENDS TO DRAW A LOT OF ATTENTION. AND PEOPLE CAN SOMETIMES FORGET THESE APARTMENT FACILITIES LIKE THE SPILLWAY THE OUTLET WORKS THE POWER PLANT THEY DON'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE THAT REALLY BIG ELEPHANT THE ROOM. GETS THE ATTENTION SO WE NEED THAT TO THINK ABOUT THAT AND HAVE THAT ATTENTION BY THE PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE A PROCESS CALLED THE POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES ANALYSIS A PROCEDURE THAT USED TO LIVE IN DAM SAFETY AND I WANT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT UP HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF YOU WANNA KNOW MORE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS WITH IT IT WAS DONE AT ORACLE. BUT IT FOCUSES ON THE RISK OF HAVING RESERVOIR WATER RELEASED. SO IF YOU GET TO A POINT LIKE AT THE SERVICE BILL WAY. WHEN THEY DID THIS THEY CONCLUDED THAT THE ROCK THE SERVICE SPILLWAY WAS SUCH THAT EVEN IF EROSION HAPPENED EVEN IF THE SLAB. WITH FAILED THE EROSION WOULDN'T GO BACK UP TO THE GATE STRUCTURE WOULDN'T RELEASE THE STORAGE SO THEY STOPPED IT LOOK ANY FURTHER AND. WELL THEIR RISK AS. PROS BY THIS INCIDENT AND AS DISCUSSED EARLIER TODAY WITH THESE POWER LINES HIM DOWNSTREAM OF THE MERCY SPILLWAY THAT IN OUR CURRENT USE THE PROCESS DON'T COME OUT. AND PROBABLY NEW NEED TO COME OUT. AND THEN. THE LAST ONE THERE FOR OUR INDUSTRY IS OWNERS OFTEN THINK THAT IF THEY DO WHAT THE DIRECT WHAT THE REGULAR TELLS THEM TO DO ALL OF THEIR RISK ARE DRESSED. AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE BECAUSE THROUGH IT REGULATORS AGAIN OFTEN ARE FOCUSED ON. THIS RELEASE OF RESERVOIR AND NOT THESE OTHER NON RELEASE. INCIDENT SO THAT'S WHAT OUR REPORT HAD TO SAY AND IN SHORT AND UP BE HAPPY TO. ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSION ON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M JUST START ONE OF A START UP BY AM. THINKING IT PW R.. I KNOW IT'S IT IT'S BEEN AT LEAST INCREDIBLY STRESSFUL SITUATION TO HAVE THE WHOLE STATE EYES ON YOU. AND HAVING YOUR YOUR WHOLE AND DIVISION EVERYONE EVERYONE'S EYES ARE ON THAT RIGHT. THEM. SO I THINK IT IS IT IS A. IT IS NATURAL I FEEL. DEFENSIVE IT UNDER THE MICROSCOPE BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHT YOU ARE IN EVERYBODY'S WATCHING. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT OCCURRED THAT THE ABUSES MILLIONS OF ACRES FEET OF WATER A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT WE HOLD TO. TO TRANSFER ACROSS THE STATE. THEN AND IT BRAIN AWAY MORE THAN ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO WRITE SO THE CONTEXT WAS. AND THAT HAPPENED. BUT AS WE AS GOING FORWARD AND TO MR FRANCE. JUST WANTED ENGINEER SOCIAL WORKER RIGHTS AYE I START DOING ANALOGIES IN MY HEAD OF. LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS RATES WE GET MARRIED THE SIXTIES% THAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS A REAL FIRM FOUNDATION AND AS THEY GO ON. THINGS STILL SHAKY TO GET COMPLACENT AND THEN A BIG CRISIS OCCURS. AND THE RELATIONSHIP BEGINS TO CRUMBLE AND YOU THINK YOU KNOW HOW. SO IN A RELATIONSHIP WHO SCUTTLED BACK HOW HOW COULD WE HAVE SEEN THIS. AND I KNOW YOU HAD ALL THE THE CONSTRUCTIONS AND EVERYTHING GOING ON AND I UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDS LIKE AND HAPPENS IN BUREAUCRACIES IN ANY ORGANIZATION. COMPLACENCY OCCURS AS A DOZEN RELATIONSHIPS. WHAT COULD HAVE MINK SO NOW YOU'VE DONE A FORENSIC? REPORT IT ARE THERE MORE KIND OF ONGOING FORENSIC. INSPECTIONS THAT CAN OCCUR DUE TO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THIS. EARLIER BECAUSE ALSO YOU WANT THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP AWAY RIGHT AND I KNOW I MEAN TO BE IT TO THAT THE AMOUNT OF REPAIRS THAT HAPPEN TO GO DOWN TO REACH BEDROCK. WAS ENCRYPT IT YOU KNOW AND AN INCREDIBLE HOW COULD THAT HAVE BEEN DONE WHILE THE DAM WAS OPERATING WITHOUT THIS CRISIS OCCURRING. IT'S A FACT I LIKE THE ANALOGY OF THE THE MARRIAGE SENSE NOT OF THAT ONE BEFORE BUT I LIKE THAT. THE THE THE THING THAT WOULD HAVE POINTED OUT IN AND THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PFM A ALMOST GOT THERE. THEY FOR THE THE ISSUE AT THE SERVICE BILL WAY THEY IDENTIFIED THE PARTICULAR FAILURE MODE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. BUT BECAUSE THE FOCUS WAS ON ONE WOULD IT RELEASED THE RESERVOIR OR NOT. OF ONCE THEY FELT THE GEOLOGY WAS WAS. SUCH THAT IT WOULD NOT REACH THE RESERVOIR. THE FAILURE MODE WASN'T CONSIDERED ANY FURTHER AND IN RETROSPECT IT MAY OF BEEN A CORRECT CONCLUSION BECAUSE IN RETROSPECT. YOU PUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CFS THROUGH THAT STRUCTURE AFTER THE MERGE THE SPILLWAY ISSUE DEVELOPED ANY DIDN'T PROGRESS BACK TOWARDS THE TO SO THAT WAS PROBABLY CORRECT INCLUSION ACTUALLY. BUT. THAT'S WERE REPORTING IT TO THE INDUSTRY AS WE NEED TO STEP BACK AND REALIZE. THAT THERE THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT. WE WE TALK ABOUT OUR REPORTS COMPONENT FAILURES WOULD THINK OF THIS SHOOT THE SHOOTER IS A COMPOUND IN THE OVERALL STRUCTURE. AND THIS SHOOT FAILED IS YOU CAN'T. TAKE THAT WORD AWAY I HAVE THIS IS NOT A DAMN FAILURE BECAUSE THE RESERVOIR WAS RELEASED BUT THE SHOOT FAIR. AND THAT COMPONENT FAILURE THEN LED TO D. W. ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE REST OF WAR THE WAY IT WOULD LIKE TO CONTROL THE REDS WERE IT LED TO ALL THAT. THE BRISK TRADE OFFS AND LED ULTIMATELY TO THE WATER GOING OVER THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. SO WE NEED TO AS A AS A DAM SAFETY PRACTICE OR STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT. WE WE NEED TO SOMEHOW FIND A WAY TO IDENTIFY THOSE MORE SERIOUS. NINE RELEASE FAILURE MODES THAT THAT AN OWNER NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT. AND AND IF THE REGULATORS OF IT WE HAVE A VERY COMPLEX REGULATORY SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE THE THE THE FEDERAL DAM OWNERS PUREXML MISSION COURT ENGINEERS REGULATE THEMSELVES. THE FEDERAL YOU REGULATORY COMMISSION FOR. REGULATES THE HYDRO POWER GENERATING DAMS ALL THE REST OF THEM ARE REGULATED BY THE STATES. AND ALL THE STATE'S ARE DIFFERENT. CALIFORNIA'S FORTUNATE THAT REALLY HAVE IF YOU STATE IS A GOOD PROGRAM IT HAS BEEN A GOOD PROGRAM. AND I'M CONFIDENT WILL LEARN FROM THIS INCIDENT WILL BE AN EVEN BETTER PROGRAM. BUT. THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE AS WE SAY HERE BEEN DRIVEN BY THE PHYSICAL INSPECTIONS WHICH IN THIS CASE WOULD NOT HAVE INDICATED THE PROBLEM. AND. THE. THEY'VE BEEN DRIVEN BYBOTH THAT AND THEN OCCASIONALLY AN INCIDENT THAT LEADS IN TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FOR MEMBER BACK TO. OF FOLSOM DAM HEN THE GATES FAILED CALIFORNIA THEN WENT OUT AND LOOKED AT ALL THE THE GATES AS IT DID OTHER REGULATORS SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE REALLY NEED TO DO NOW STEP BACK AND POLICE WITH CITIES FIND AWAY IN WITH THAT THAT'S. MORE RESOURCES OR ALLOCATING THE RESOURCES WE HAVE IN A DIFFERENT WAY TO DO THESE LOOK BACKS AT WHAT WAS DESIGNED AND BUILT. HOW DOES IT LOOK IN THE WHAT WE SUGGESTED HERE'S THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING IS YOU LOOK AT? HOW WAS IT DESIGNED AND BUILT HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO THE WAY WE WOULD DESIGN AND BUILD IT TODAY? AND. IF IT IS DIFFERENT DO THE DIFFERENCES BUT HAS LIKE COMPROMISE THE STRUCTURE. AND IF THEY DO THEN YOU NEED TO TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEN YOU NEED TO DO FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO YOU DO NOW. SO THAT'S THE. THAT'S THE BIG TAKEAWAY FOR OUR INDUSTRY IS WE'RE NOT DOING THAT NOW. AND IF WE'RE NOT THAT WE DON'T DO THAT THERE WILL BE THINGS LIKE THIS THAT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE NEXT TIME IT MIGHT NOT BE A SPILLWAYS MAYBE SOMETHING ELSE OF THE. THE LESSON DOESN'T APPLY JUST TO SPILLWAYS IT APPLIES TO THE DAM AND ALL OF ITS RELATED STRUCTURES. THANK YOU MR PERSON. I SAW A WAS REVIEW UP AND THEN I STRIPS TO PATTERSON. I THINK IT TO TO UP PICKING BACK ON THE RELATIONSHIP. ANALOGY. ITSELF LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF MISCOMMUNICATION. O. OR LACK OF COMMUNICATION SO CAN YOU. HELP ME. OR HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT CHANGES ARE GOING TO BE MADE SO THAT. THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN MASON MISCOMMUNICATION. WHAT IS WTO ARE GOING TO BE DOING TO? HELP. THE DIFFERENT. AGENCIES ARE THE DIFFERENT. DIVISIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. OKAY LEGAL STARTIN TOLL FREE ONE ACNE THING SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE YEAH I THINK THAT. WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN SOME STEPS OVER THIS LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS AND ALL RUN THROUGH A FEW OF THOSE. I THINK THE REPORT THAT THE ROAD INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAMS PUT OUT GIVES US SOME GOOD GUIDELINES AS TO WHAT. SOME OF THE FOLKS MAYBE WERE THINKING THAT THEY INTERVIEWED OR WHERE THERE WERE GAPS IN INFORMATION THAT WE CAN. I MOVE FORWARD TO FILL AND. SO PART OF IT. IS I THINK CLEARLY IDENTIFYING WE DO HAVE EXECUTIVE LEVEL POINT. PEOPLE FOR THE VARIOUS FACETS OF DAM SAFETY IN THE DEPARTMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS TO REMEMBER AS WE HAVE. MULTIPLE FACETS OF BROWN'S INFRASTRUCTURE DAM SAFETY SO I THINK IT'S MAKING SURE THAT. IT ALL OVER FOLKS UNDERSTAND THAT TOLL AS THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT IS THE DAM OWNER SO FROM THAT SIDE OF DWI ARE. ULTIMATELY THOUGH HE HAS MULTIPLE DIVISIONS UNDER HIM THAT YOU KNOW DEAL WITH THAT. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND ENGINEERING ULTIMATELY HE IS THE THE HEAD OF THAT. PART OF THE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE DECISIONS YOU KNOW BANNER RECOMMENDATIONS COME UP THROUGH HIM AND HE IS HOUSED THEM FINAL SAY ON THAT SO MAKING SURE THAT. AS A DIEM OWNER EVERYONE INTERNALLY KNOWS THAT'S JEWEL IN HIS ROLE WE ALSO HAVE OUR REGULATORY ARM THE DIVISION OR. SAFETY OF DAMS AND WE HAVE ERA COKE IS GONNA BE PART OF THE NEXT PANEL IS OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THAT PIECE. HAS WHEELS ARE CHIEF ENGINEER SHARING TAPIO SO. PEOPLE ARE IN PLACE BUT UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU DO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY. THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT UNDERSTANDS WHERE THAT RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ROLES LIFE SO I THINK THAT IS. AN EASY FIX IN MY OPINION I THINK IT'S JUST MAKING SURE WE CLARIFY THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN THROUGH THE RANKS. WE HAVE DONE ALSO A BIT OF WOOD AND BEGINNING TO CONTINUE TO RE ORGANIZE INTERNALLY TO HAVE A COUPLE OTHER POINTS PEOPLE WE HAVE SOMEBODY THAT WE RECENTLY PUT IN PLACE AS A. EXECUTIVE LEVEL OB PROJECT MANAGER FOR ALL THINGS WERE A BILL SO THIS PERSON WORKS WHICH ALL THEY WORK WITH THEIR COKE BUT THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT THE BROADER SCALE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CONSTRUCTION THE DAY TO DAY. SO WE'RE MAKING SURE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT THAT PERSON. ALL ORVILLE COMMUNICATIONS CORRESPONDENCE GOES THROUGH THAT PERSON AND IN FACT THAT PERSON KEEPS MYSELF FOR DIRECTOR IN THE OTHER DEPUTIES INFORMED SO WE'RE GONNA TIGHTENING THAT THAT INTERNAL STRUCTURE AROUND INFORMATION FLOW. BOTH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND INSIDE AND OUT AND I KNOW THERE WILL BE OTHERIMPROVEMENTS SERVE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE WILL NEED TO MAKE. WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE CAPACITY TO DO THINGS THERE ARE INTERNAL INTRANET. A WE HAVE A FABULOUS OR A FILM LIKE IT'S FABULOUS MAYBE NOT EVERYBODY THINKS SO BUT WE HAVEN'T OR OF THE WEB PAGE NOW. THAT IS OUTWARD FACING BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO WE HAVE A LOT OF STAFF THAT. HER ARMOR CLUED INTO THAT LOOKING TO THAT GETTING INFORMATION FROM THERE AS WE CAN USE THAT AS A TOOL TO KEEP PEOPLE INFORMED WE HAVE AN FAQ. I THINK THEY'LL BE SOME ADDITIONAL FAQS THAT COME OUT OF THE FORENSIC TEAM REPORT THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF. THIS IS YOU KNOW UP. GOOD THE ROLES OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THIS IS WHAT DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR SO WE CAN WE CAN GET THE WORD OUT THAT WAY AS WELL. AND THERE'S MORE TO COME OBVIOUSLY WITH OUR ORGANIZATIONAL TOM. S. STRUCTURE TRAINING THAT SOMETHING WILL NEED TO LOOK AT IT AND I THINK THERE WERE SOME GOOD OPTIONS WITHIN THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. WITHIN THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE TO DO MORE TRAINING INTERNALLY TO GET MORE STUFF SORT OF. INFORMED IN AND AWARE OF OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND OUR RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE REQUIREMENTS AND WHATNOT SO. MYSELF IN THE EXECUTIVE TEAM ARE TAKING A CAREFUL LOOK AT HOW WE CAN AT. JUST GIVE THAT INFORMATION FLOW I THINK IN IN MY OPINION. PART OF WHAT I I GOT FROM THE REPORT WAS WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE INFORMED I THINK AND THEY HAVE QUESTIONS AND MAYBE THEY HAVEN'T MADE THEIR WAY TO ME BUT THEY THEY ARE THERE NOW. SNOW NOW I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HELPS AT ALL. WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND IF THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ON. YEAH WE WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY BE HAPPY TO COME AND PROVIDE UPDATES AS WE KIND OF BUILD IT'S IT'S IT'S A COMPLICATED. PROCESS IT'S A BIG DEPARTMENT WE'VE MADE SOME INITIAL STEPS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BUILDING A PRCE LIKE THINK MY CONCERN IS THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF FOLKS I DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OR. AND SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE ADDRESSING THAT I HAVE MY ANSWER OR I'M SORRY THE ANSWER THAT I'M LOOKING FOR. YOU KNOW A COMPLACENCY I LOVE. DOCTOR EGGMAN'S ANALOGY BECAUSE THE COMPLACENT SOUNDS LIKE. THERE WAS A LOT OF COMPLACENCY AND I. PEOPLE DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES WERE AND SO THAT'S A MORE WHEN I'M LOOKING FOR OKAY. I'M I THINK TO A DO OU WANT HIM MAYBE IF I CAN HAVE A LITTLE. TOO DEPUTY I JUST SAID. YOU KNOW ONE. WE WE AS WE WERE EXAMINING OURSELVES AFTER FEBRUARY WE STARTED RECOVERY THERE'S A LOT OF CONCLUSIONS IN HERE THAT WE OURSELVES CRADDOCK. AND HE'S HE'S ALSO SUPPORTING SO WE HAVE NOW TAKEN CARE ALL COMMUNICATION. ALL THAT'S GOING ON THROUGH ONE EXECUTIVE THAT IS WAYNE AND AND THAT'S HIS DAY JOB NOW. FOR NOW. AS WE CONTINUE TO TAKE THIS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT DONE. YOU KNOW ABSORBING ALL OF IT AND REALLY COMING OUT WITH WHAT IS THE WORK STRUCTURE THAT MAKE SURE THEIR IS A SINGLE EXECUTIVE THAT'S REALLY WEIGHING IN ON ALL DECISIONS RELATED THEY CAN MAKE TAKEN THAT RISK. AND PUT IT INTO HOW WE MANAGE ALL OUR ASSETS. PUTTING THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM. AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE TAKING THOSE STEPS THE COMMUNICATION. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL ONE AM. D. AN ENGINEERING HIS. CARMEN IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THERE'S ALWAYS THAT NATURAL ENGINEERING TENSION. BUT IT CAN NOT CONTINUE OTHERWISE THE DOCKS THAT MR FRANCE WAS TALKING ABOUT WON'T ALWAYS GET CONNECTED SO THE COMMUNICATION IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO BUILD WE NEED TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE COMMUNICATING. SO THAT WHEN WE IMPLEMENT THE NEW PROCESS IS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEWS ALL THE WAY TO DESIGN. THAT DOES DOTS ARE LOOKED AT AND SEEN AND AND WE CAN TAKE ACTION ON SO WE STARTED NOW WITH AN EXECUTIVE WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT AND THIS FORENSIC REPORT. INFORMATION WILL LEAD US TO VOTERS WAS OUR FINAL OR. AND THAT TOP DOWN APPROACH LOOKS LIKE. IS IT OKAY TO ADD JUST ONE MORE THING TO CIRCLE BACK TO SORT OF THE RELATIONSHIP QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT I THINK YOU FOR THE KNOWLEDGE MEAN ABOUT BEING UNDER THE MICROSCOPE AND ALL EYES ON US. IT IS A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE BUT I WILL SAY THAT I THINK. THE SILVER LINING OF IT IS IT WILL. MOVE US FORWARD IN TERMS OF IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES AND ENHANCEMENTS NONPROFIT A FASTER PACE THEN WE WOULD SO WHILE NOT FUN I DO. MYSELF AND OTHERS WELCOME IT AS. OF MOMENTUM TO TO KIND OF KEEP THIS GOING HANGING MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CHANGES AND BE CREATIVE AND ADD AND KIND OF THINKING OUTSIDE OF THE BOX SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE. JUST AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT ARM. IT. I'VE ASKED IN. IT'S DIFFERENT MOVIES BUT WHAT UC ACCOUNTABILITY. PRACTICES I GUESS IF YOU IF YOU WELL I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IMPROVEMENTS YOU KNOW ETCETERA ETCETERA WHAT ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISMS ARE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SRE THAT. YOU KNOW THESE FOLKS THAT. WHATEVER THE THE ISSUES MAY BE. KIDS WE CAN TALK ABOUT PRACTICES AND YOU KNOW CHANGIN THE POLICIES AND ALL OF THAT BUT IF THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY WILL. MATTER. UNIT WE CAN PUT THE BEST PRACTICES IN PLACE BUT IF THERE'S NOBODY BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT. WHATEVER YOU PUT IN PLACES IS IS BEING FOLLOWED SO. I GUESS IT'S NOT REALLY A QUESTION IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT BUT YOU KNOW I I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE SOMETIMES. AND I FOUND THAT IN MANY OF OUR AGENCIES THERE IS NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY. AYE AND. THE THE WE CAN TALK TO OR PLAN THE FACE BUT IF NOBODY'S BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEN INCIDENTS LIKE THIS CAN HAPPEN AGAIN ARE HOPEFULLY NOT TO THIS EXTENT BUT. WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER NO ILENE AYE INFRASTRUCTURE. ARE AND IF THERE IS NO COMMUNICATION AND THERE'S NO REAL ACCOUNTABILITY IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AGAIN AND SO I GUESS IN IN YOUR AYE IMPLEMENTATION OF. OF OUR PRACTICES THERE HAS TO BE A REAL ACCOUNTABILITY. BOB PIECE ATTACHED TO ALL THOSE AND SO HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU COME UP WITH THAT IF WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION ON HOW. YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE BEING PHAM. THINK. DISA DERBY CAN BE VERY PAINFUL. OF AND I'M ALSO PLEASED. AND ALL SAVE FOR FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW THAT THAT NEW DIRECTOR JUST PINPOINT GRANT DAVIS. IS FROM OUTSIDE THE AGENCY SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME THE COMPLACENCY THAT CAN OCCUR WHEN EVERYBODY'S BEEN A REALLY LONG TIME. WHICH IS TO CONVERT NATURE BUREAUCRACY BUT HAVING NEW OUTSIDE EYES COMING IN AS A DIRECTOR. I THINK WILL BE GOOD A. MR PATERSON DID YOU. MISTER PATTERSON. A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FIRST TO UP. FRETS UMP. AYE. I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT APPEARS TO BE CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE THAT WERE IGNORED? WE HEARD WE HEARD ABOUT CRACKS. AND. FLOWS. AND WE ALSO HEARD ABOUT BORE HOLES AS FUNDAMENTAL REASONS FOR I GUESS THAT. A FAILURE. HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS? WHETHER THIS WAS. A REASONABLE OVERSIGHT. OUR A PRACTICE OVER TIME THAT SOMEHOW DEVELOPED WITH MAYBE SOME OF THE COMPLACENCY THAT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT. AND TO WHAT DEGREE DID THIS SURPRISE YOU OR SH SHAKE YOU. WAS IT A RED LIGHT SIGNAL GOING OFFER WAS IT A CAUTION SIGNAL THAT WAS. FLASHING SHOULD THIS HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED. IT. IT WAS NOT A RED LIGHT SIGNAL OF AND IF I CAN GO BACK TO YOUR CANARIES IN THE COALMINE ANALOGY A MOMENT AGO. THE CANARIES MAY HAVE BEEN IN THE COAL MINE BUT THEY WERE IN A DEEP SECTION OF THE COAL MINE THAT WASN'T BEING WORKED ANYMORE. SO THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T THERE SEEING THOSE CANARIES THAT THE DATA THAT SHOWED LEAD TO PROBLEMS WITH THE GEOLOGY WAS IN THE RECORDS. OF THE W. ARE THEY WERE THERE BUT YOU HAD TO GO DEEP INTO THOSE RECORDS BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTIES YOU NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR TO FIND. SOME OF THE LATER REPORTS DIDN'T REPEAT IT AND THEN AS I TALKED ABOUT WITH THIS NORMALIZATION OF THE OF THE UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE CRACKS IN THE AND THE TRAINS. NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT IT ANYMORE. THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN POTENTIAL FAILURE MODE ANALYSIS-ALMOST GOT THERE. BUT BECAUSE THEY CONCLUDED THAT IT WOULDN'T RELEASED THE RESERVOIR THEY DIDN'T DIG THAT BIT DEEPER THAT YOU HAD TO GO BACK INTO THOSE RECORDS TO FIND IT. SO IT WAS THERE BUT YOU HAD TO DIG FOR THAT THERE WASN'T A FLASHING RED LIGHT RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND THAT'S A LITTLE. IS WE TALK ABOUT THIS MORE DETAIL IN THE REPORT IT'S MORE A PRACTICE. IT'S NOT A TYPICAL PRACTICE WHAT OUR INDUSTRY IS DOING RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S WHY OUR INDUSTRY I'M A PART OF IT IS SO I NEED TO LEARN THIS TO. WE NEED TO LEARN THAT THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE OF THAT DEEP DIVE INTO THE INFORMATION. SO FROM THE STANDPOINT OF DID IT SURPRISE US. IT DID SURPRISE ME UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO SAY NO IT DIDN'T SURPRISE ME BECAUSE. I KNOW THE WAY THE INDUSTRY WORKS AND AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO IMPROVE OUR WAY OF DOING THINGS TO DO IT BETTER SO THERE WASN'T A FLASHING RED LIGHT THAT WAS MISSED. YOU HAD TO BE A LOT MORE DILIGENT TO GET IS THERE IS THERE ANY. UP. IN YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE AND LOOKING AT THIS. ARE THERE OTHER. BUT WHAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT YOU HAVE DUG THROUGH ALL OF THIS. AND YOU ARE A RENOWNED EXPERT AND YOUR TEAM WAS A RENOWNED EXPERT. APART FROM LEARNING ABOUT WHAT WENT WRONG HERE. DO YOU. HAVE ANY CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE OTHER TICKING TIME BOMBS BECAUSE OF THE STRUCTURE BECAUSE OF THE OVER CONFIDENCE BECAUSE OF. OF THE COMPLACENCY. ARE THERE OTHER. THINGS GOING ON OUT THERE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT YOU WORRY OVER. I DO. BECAUSE PARENTS THE THE DAMN INFRASTRUCTURE IS RELATIVELY OLD INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE AVERAGE AGE OF DAMS IS FIFTY YEARS ARE GREATER. AND A LOT OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT DOING THIS DEEP DIVE INTO THE INFORMATION SO THAT'S THE WORRY AND THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE WAKEUP CALL TO WEAR INDUSTRIES WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE RIGHT NOW NOT. DIGGING IS DEEPLY AS WE NEED TO DEFINE THOSE TICKING TIME BOMBS IF YOU LIKE. AND. HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE A LESSON R. INDUSTRY WILL TAKE TO HEART WILL LEARN AND WILL. WE BUT IT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR. CORD LEGISLATURE'S LIKE YOURS AND IN OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE IT MAY TAKE MORE RESOURCES THAN WE'VE BEEN PUTTING ON A HISTORICALLY. I THINK AGENCIES WILL TAKE A LOOK AT CAN THEY RE EVALUATE AND AND REASSIGNED THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE BUT SOME OF THEM ARE GOING TO NEED MORE RESOURCES. ALSO DEDUCED THESE DEEP DIVES INTO THE INFORMATION AND THEN MAKE THOSE EVALUATIONS AYE YEAH I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER. MEMBERS IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHO HAVE EXPRESSED REAL CONCERN THAT ARE FUNDAMENTAL INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT BEEN MODERNIZED. IN A LONG LONG TIME AND THAT WE HAVE NOT REALLY SPENT THE KIND OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE A GEM OF THE HYDROLOGY SYSTEM. BUT IT IS OLD OUTDATED AND. FRAUGHT WITH WITH SOME PROBLEMS AND SO THIS IS NOT ONLY I THINK FROM A WAKE UP CALL. FOR THE OPERATION IT IS A WAKE UP CALL FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM AND IT CANNOT WAIT ANY ANY LONGER A QUESTION TO. TO DO D. W. ARE UP. THAT PAGE FIFTY NINE AND IN THE REPORT. USED SOME LANGUAGE OF SIGNIFICANTLY OVERCONFIDENT. AND COMPLACENT ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF ITS STATE WATER PROJECT. INFRASTRUCTURE. I DO YOU. DO YOU CONCUR WITH THE FINDINGS THAT. THERE WAS COMPLACENCY THAT OVERCONFIDENCE. RIGHT POLLSTER WITHOUT ON ON. AYE. WE ARE CONFIDENT WE HAVE BEEN CONFIDENT ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE OVERCONFIDENT I DON'T KNOW THAT I. COMPLETELY AGREE ARE NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT. I THINK THE CONFIDENCE CAME. IN PART FROM THE INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN THE DATA WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THAT. CONTINUE TO LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE WAS. IN GOOD SHAPE THEIR WARRANT ISSUES THAT WE NOW RECOGNIZE THERE ARE. HOME I THINK. BUT I WOULD ALSO. NOT WHOLE HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH COMPLACENCY BUT I. WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. AS A WAKE UP CALL THAT THIS IS WE DO NEED TO NOT ONLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR FOR STRUCTURE BUT THE OTHER DAMS THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT WE'VE ALREADY BEGUN THESE RE EVALUATIONS. WE REALLY NEED TO NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND REALIZE THAT. WE HAVE BEEN OPERATING TO THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS TO WHAT THE REGULATORS HAVE ASKED US TO DO BUT WE DO NEED TO DO A DEEPER DIVE AT THIS POINT TO REALLY LOOK AT. IT. POTENTIAL ISSUES THE TRUE NATURE OF THE TRUE. I AM LOSING MY WE'RE HERE THE. CURRENT STATUS OF. DAMS OF OTHER SPILLWAYS SO WE HAVE TO GET. AWAY AND COME BACK WITH SOME FRESH ICE I THINK MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY I WOULD PERMITTED TO SAY. WE NEED TO DO A DEEPER DIVE WE NEED TO GO ON WITH A FRESH SET OF EYES. AND I'M. AND. WE WILL DO THE ON PAGE PAGE SIXTY. EW R. WAS LARGELY IN A MODE TO REACT TO PROBLEMS. WITHITS STATE WATER PROJECT CIVIL INFRASTRUCTURE. AT AS THEY AROSE IN THE SHORT TERM RATHER THAN TAKING PREEMPTIVE ACTIONS PROACTIVELY TO PREVENT THE PROBLEMS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT FINDING. YOU MIND IF I PUMP THIS ONE TWO YEARS. BECAUSE OF THAT COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF. PUT THIS ON OVER TO JOLT JUST BECAUSE I THINKING GIVING HIM MORE IN DEPTH ANSWER REACTIVE RATHER THAN PROACTIVE THAT'S A CLAIM IN THE REPORT RIGHT. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. NO BUT GOING BACK TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION JUST ADD A LITTLE BIT I I WANT TO REALLY LEVERAGE THE. THE A FORENSICS REPORT LESSONS LEARNED ON THE PROBABLE FAILURE MODES ANALYSIS BECAUSE. FUNDAMENTALLY THAT IS THE BEGINNING. AND SETS REALLY THE OBJECTIVE FOR. WHAT YEAR PROTECTING FROM? AND IF CURRENTLY WERE PROTECTING FROM A FULL DAM FAILURE. THEN THAT DOES. YOU KNOW COULD. REALLY TAKE AWAY ALL THOSE OTHER FAILURES THAT HAVE COME AND DON'T MEAN NOT A FULL DAM FAILURE BUT STILL ENDS UP BEING AND IT'S. OR NUMBERS SEE WHAT I WANT TO GET TOO SO I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE TO CHANGE THAT THINKING. WHICH THEN PULLS YOU INTO NOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT EVERY COMPONENT OF THIS OF THE OF THE SYSTEM. ON THE ONTHE BEING REACTIVE OR NOT. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT. YOU KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EVEN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STARTED UPGRADING OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO REALLY LOOK AT. EVERY ASSET FROM MY RISK PUBLIC SAFETY TWO EVEN TO THE BUSINESS PROCESS ABOUT. DELIVERING WATER IN IN THE REPORTED DOES SAY WE NEED TO CONTINUE LEVERAGE THAT'S I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE IT STARTED IT'S A FIVE YEAR PROJECT WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY THERE YET. BUT I THINK THAT WAS VERY PROACTIVE OF PARIS DAM THE DEPARTMENT TOOK ON ON ITS OWN THAT PROJECT TO REALLY. BOLSTER IT FROM FROM THE SEISMIC PERSPECTIVE AND WE WERE NOT TOLD BY FOR COR DS SO NEED TO DO THAT THAT WAS ON OUR OWN AND THAT WAS A VERY EXPENSIVE. PROJECT BUT IT'S THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO SO I SEE OURSELVES AS A. PROACTIVE ORGANIZATION BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND FROM THE INFORMATION THE FORENSICS TEAM HAD AND WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THAT YEAH THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DONE ON THAT SPILLWAYS IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE IF WE HAD DONE THE INSPECTIONS THAT THEY INDUSTRY IS LEARNING FROM AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO. YOU KNOW THAT'S NOW AT LEAST IN MY OPINION. THE. THERE'S A CONVERSATION HERE FROM OTHER MEMBERS IN QUESTIONS FROM OTHER MEMBER WITH RESPECT COMMUNICATION AND THE LINE OF. RESPONSIBILITY. IT IT IS MY OBSERVATION THAT MUCH OF WHAT WE ARE. A TALKING ABOUT HERE MUCH OF THE PROBLEMS WERE IS IS QUITE FRANKLY INHERENT IN ALL BUREAUCRACIES. IT IS ALMOST THE NATURE OF BUREAUCRACIES. AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW HARRY TRUMAN HAD A THE THE BUCK STOPS HERE ON HIS ON HIS. PRESIDENTIAL DESK. AND D. W. ARE WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOP WHO IS THE FINAL EXECUTIVE. WITH THE AUTHORITY. TO DEVELOP AND AND AND CREATE. A DEPARTMENT THAT WILL IN FACT DIG DOWN DEEPER WILL IN FACT FIND SOME OF THE. CIRCUMSTANCES AND AND WILL IN FACT MOVE THE THE. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM AWAY FROM. REACTIVE TO PROACTIVE SO THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE IMPROVED TO PREVENT. A PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY START WHERE DOES THE BUCK STOP. THE BUCK STOPS WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT. THAT IS WITHIN MY SUPPORT AND THE DEPUTIES AS THE EXECUTIVE TEAM MAKING SURE THAT WE. BRING THAT INFORMATION UP WE AS EXPERTS IN OUR OWN. RIGHTS PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ULTIMATELY THE DIRECTOR HOW I'M GONNA ASK THE. WHAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT QUESTION IS WELL WHAT DOES KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT YOU YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS EVERYDAY? YOU REPORT TO US IN THE SPOTLIGHT CAN BE. PRETTY PRETTY US SIGNIFICANT BUT YOU HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES AND I KNOW YOU TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY WHAT KEEPS YOU AWAKE AT NIGHT ABOUT THIS HYDRAULICALLY HYDROLOGIST SYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE. PRO ACTIVELY REPAIRED. AND MODERNIZED. SO FOR ME BECAUSE I AM ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT IS VERY MUCH ABOUT KEEPING THE TRAINS GOING IN MAKING SURE THE TRAINS ARE RUNNING ON KEEPING THINGS ORGANIZED I'M MORE OF THE INWARD FOCUS FOR THE DEPARTMENT FOR ME. IT IS HOW. WE. WE HAVE A ROAD MAP SO TO SPEAK FROM THIS REPORT FROM THE WORK THAT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED WITH OUR COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WITH A RISK ASSESSMENT. MOVING THAT INTO IMPLEMENTATION PHASE I KNOW WE CAN GET THERE BUT. I SPEND HOURS AT NIGHT. JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WE MOVE THAT FORWARD DO HAVE THE RESOURCES HOW DO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE WITH THE RIGHT EXPERTISE JUST PULLING THAT ALL TOGETHER. I DON'T DOUBT THAT WE CAN'T MAKE THESE CHANGES AND BE ACCOUNTABLE BUT. WE ARE A BIG DEPARTMENT THERE IS. A LOT OF WORK TO DO HERE AND HOW I AM VERY DEDICATED AS IS THE EXECUTIVE TEAM. BUT GETTING THERE YOU KNOW JUST MAKING THIS WEEK IS. GONNA BE A HECK OF A LOT OF WORK ONE FINAL QUESTION MR FRANCE THE. STATE WATER PROJECT IS UNIQUE IN THAT THE W. OUR FUNCTION AS AS BOTH THE OWNER IN THE REGULAR. I CONSIDERING THE W. ARE SUBSTANTIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLEXITY. THEN YOU BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE ANOTHER ENTITY ASSIST WITH OPERATIONS OF THE STATE WATER. PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY THE. ORAL VILLE FACILITIES AND DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE DIVISION OF SAFETY AND DAM SHOULD REMAIN UNDER THE W. ARE. YES IT IS RICOCHET DO OF THE SITUATION WHERE THE THE ONE DEPARTMENT HAS BOTH THE REGULATOR AND DAM OWNER. AYE I WOULD COMMITTEES NOT ACTUALLY UNIQUE. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES WHERE EXACTLY THE SAME SITUATION EXISTS IN MY HOME STATE OF COLORADO. THE SAME SITUATION EXISTS DEPARTMENT NATURAL RESOURCES. HOUSES THE. THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM AND IT ALSO HOUSES THE PARKS AND WILDLIFE DEPARTMENT WHICH OWNS DAMS THAT ARE REGULATED BY THAT GROUP I BELIEVE IN MEXICO'S THE SAME WAY I THINK YOU'LL FIND MULTIPLE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY IT IS SAME WAY. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN INHERENT FLAW I THINK THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WORK VERY WELL. IT DOES RELY ON KEEPING THAT REGULATOR. KEEPING SEPARATION PUNIT REGULATOR AND THE OWNER. AND WE DID WE'VE BELIEVE FROM WHAT THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD AND WE SAW IS THAT. THAT'S REALLY NOT A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM HERE DSO DE IS NOT EASIER ON D. W. ARE THAT IS ON ON ITS OTHER OWNERS. IN IN FACT IF ANYTHING WE PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT OF OF EVIDENCE THAT SUGGESTED DSO DE MIGHT BE EVEN A LITTLE HARDER ON D. W. ARTISTS OCCUR COMPENSATE FOR THAT SITUATION SO. THAT THERE ARE OTHER MODELS AND NOT SAYING THATTHE THERE'S NOT REASON TO THINK ABOUT ANOTHER MODEL BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE IT'S NOT TO BE A FATAL FLAW IT DEPENDS ON THE DEDICATION OF THE DAM SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE IN THE DAM SAFETY DIVISION AND. I THINK YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD DEDICATED PEOPLE HERE AND THAT'S HOW I DON'T SEE THAT. UP I'LL JUST CONCLUDE WE EAT. WE HEARD THE A WORD ABOUT WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT. LIVES WERE NOT LOST. SEEMS TO ME THAT WE WERE MORE LUCKY THAN GOOD. AND IT SEEMS THAT IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR US NOT TO DEPEND ON BLOCK SO MUCH. TO GET A WHOLE LOT BETTER AT WHAT. THINK MISTER PATTERSON ALMOST FRAZIER. THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR. SO WE TALK ABOUT. HIS SEISMIC HAS BEEN. DISCUSSED. VERY ON A VERY SMALL SCALE. WHOM WE HAD LOMA PRIETA IN CALIFORNIA WE WENT THROUGH IN REEF RETROFITTED ALL THE BRIDGES IN CALIFORNIA AND EX A COST. IT WAS ENORMOUS. BUT THERE WAS NO. EXPENSE SPARED BECAUSE. OF THE SAFETY. THAT IT AFFORDED. WHAT PLANS YOU HAVE GOING FORWARD KNOWING THE DESIGN CRITERIA THIS CHANGE TECHNOLOGY IS CHANGED? IN IN CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS. BECAUSE CONCRETE DOES HAVE A LIFESPAN. WELL WE KNOW THAT UP TO DATE THAT IF THIS DAMN WORTH SPILLWAYS BEEN TREATED IN THIS FASHION AND ALL OF THEM HAVE PROBABLY BEEN TREATED IN THIS FASHION. WITH TOPICAL REPAIRS THAT ARE JUST BANDAIDS. WHAT ARE YOU? WHAT IS YEAR PLANS TO GO OUT AND INSPECT FORENSICALLY? ON THE OTHER DANCE SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE AT RISK AND WE CAN HAVE AN ASSURANCE. WITH THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN ELSEWHERE. YOU KNOW AND ALSO BEFORE THE RESPOND AND THEY'RE GONNA RESPOND BUT. I THINK WILL GO INTO DEBT DEEPER TO ON THE ON THE NEXT PANEL WHICH WILL FOCUS ON THE DAM SAVED UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO WHICH SLEEVED R. CHRISTOPHER SUREI MEAN YOU GO AHEAD BECAUSE YOU'RE TO BE ON THE NEXT PANEL TO HOPPING ON TAKE IT NOW OR HAVE OTHER PEOPLE UP HERE WITH YOU COULD YOU HAVE OTHER EXPERTS UP. WHEN YOU ANSWER THAT THAT. I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET OUT TO. OKAY I'M. BLACK CHAIR WAS GOING TO SAVE IF YOU. WANT TO HOLD THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO RUN THROUGH ANOTHER QUICK PRESENTATION THAT SORT OF SETS THE STAGE FOR WHAT WE'VE ALREADY STARTED DOING AND MOMENT. OKAY THANK YOU SO THE OTHER TO FURTHER IS. SO WE ALSO WHEN YOU SAY THE BUCK STOPS WITH EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IN ONE NOT WE HAVE A HUGE. CHANGE OF STAFF IN AGENCIES. WHAT PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE TO? I HAVE. INSPECTIONS AND AND THEN FOLLOW UP AND LEFT LIKE A FLOW CHART OF WHAT WHAT GOES IN PLACE TO. CREATE. A PROCESS THAT. IS RECOGNIZED BY THE EXPERTS AND I'M NOT SAYING AND I'M NOT TRYING TO DIMINISH. YOU KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHO SAYS YOU'RE QUALIFIED TO MAKE HIS INSPECTION R. AND ARE YOU. GETTING THE RIGHT PEOPLE. BECAUSE FROM WHAT I'M SEEING IF WE HAVE AN WATER INTRUSION SPILLWAYS IS CREATING. A RUSTING OF COP OF. REBAR. AND IT'S BALLING AND NOW IT'S SO WE COMPLAIN BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE THE TINSEL STRENGTH THAT USE TO HAVE BECAUSE NOW. IT'S DIMINISHED. OF OVER A PERIOD TIME. OF WHAT WHAT YOU GONNA PUT IN PLACE SO WITH STAFF CHANGES THAT YOU HAVE A NORMAL. SET OF STANDARDS. NO ALL STARTIN DEPEND ON SO THAT IT THERE ARE SOME. STANDARDS GUIDELINES PROTOCOLS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE THAT COME FROM PRIMARILY OUR REGULATORY. ENTITIES SO DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS AND FOR. AND THOSE ARE PRIMARILY WHAT WE FOLLOW WHEN THE DEPARTMENT HAS A DAMN OWNER AS MANY OTHER DAM OWNERS DO. THEY ARE. WRITTEN DOWN THEY'VE BEEN FOLLOWED WE. WHO OVER THE ENTIRE? HISTORY YEAR LIFESPAN OF THE DAM AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE WE HAVE DONE OUR ANNUAL INSPECTIONS ARE EVERY TWO YEAR INSPECTIONS ARE FIVE YEAR INSPECTION SO THESE ARE. LAID OUT BY THE DIFFERENT REGULATORY ENTITIES WE HAVE OUR STAFF THAT OR TRAINED. IN THESE AREAS OF DAM SAFETY AND. FIELDS OF ENGINEERING BUT WE ALSO UTILIZE A LOT OF OUTSIDE EXPERTISE IN TERMS OF CONSULTANTS THAT ARE EXPERTS IN THESE FIELDS SO. WE DO HAVE OUR OUR FOLKS THERE OBVIOUSLY. MS TURNOVER IN STAFF BUT THE FRAMEWORK IS THERE BY WHICH WE OPERATE UNDER IN REPORT OUT THROUGH THE HAND SO IT'S IT'S BEYOND. JUST DWI R.. TIGHTEN UP THAT. GOING TO GET HIM HOME LOOKING FOR BECAUSE IF THE PROTOCOLS ARE IN PLACE. WE HAD A MASSIVE FAILURE BECAUSE PARTICLES PART FOLLOWED IN SOME FORM OF RESPECT OF THE REPAIRS. THAT'S THE REPAIRS WERE DONE IN THE APPROPRIATE FASHION. IN THE WASN'T INTRUSION PIMP. I'M SAYING POSSIBLY. THE FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN MINIMIZED. SO COULD WE SHOULD WRITE BUT. WE DIDN'T DO THINGS APPROPRIATELY IN. AND CONCRETE I MEAN THERE'S THREE THINGS IN LIFE DEATH TAXES IN CONCRETE CRACKS OKAY. GUARANTEED. I'M WILL TALK WITH THE NEW PANEL. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE COULD CRACK CRACK OF CONCRETE AND IN THE UP. THE NEW SPILLING HER IN THE IN THE CURRENT. OF. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I'M I'M. CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT. THERE IS NO. CONSISTENCY. IN. GOING OUT IN NUMBERS ACCOUNTABLE HIS AS. I MEAN. WHAT HAPPENS IF THEY DON'T DO IT RIGHT ONLY ONE THAT PAYS FOR THE ADDITIONAL REPAIRS ARE THEY ARE THE FAILURE IS THE TAXPAYER? THE AGENCY JUST CLOSE MY EYES AS WE NEED TO DO WE NEED TO FIX IT. SOMEONE LOOKING FOR. IN THIS PROCESS. THAT THERE'S MORE THAN. AND I THINK IT WAS. TOUCHED ON BY MISTER PATTERSON. SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE ONE COMES TO FOLLOW UP AND THAT THEY DID TO REPAIRS WERE DONE ACCORDANCE TO. STRINGENT GUIDELINES. AND THAT WE GO FORWARD. AND KNOW THE FACT IS WE'RE GOING IN TO DO EXACTLY WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT FUTURE. DEGRADATION OF THE CONCRETE A REBAR WHATEVER GOING FOR. SO HOW DO YOU. HOW DOES HE W. OR LOOK AT THAT? ON. GOING FORWARD I MEAN. DIDN'T DO YOU GUYS HAVE A PLAN. HARD TO PUT THAT THAT UP BOUNCING CHECKS AND BECAUSE IT WASN'T THERE BEFORE. I THINK. SO. I BELIEVE WE DO I MEAN THE FORENSICS REPORT KIND OF LAYS OUT THE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE HAVE TO INCORPORATE THERE'S NO. YEAH AND IF SOMEBODY'S WE HAVEN'T INCORPORATED WE HAVE ALREADY INITIATED AND JUST RECENTLY. A DAM SAFETY INITIATIVE. AND THAT GROUP IS BEING LED UNDER THE NEW EXECUTIVE THAT WE PUT IS GONE IS ALREADY STARTED. GOING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON WHO HAS A GOOD PROGRAMS GOING TO THE BUREAU. NEXT WEEK. THAT THEIR PROGRAM TO COME BACK. AND THERE AND TO DO AN ASSESSMENT AND USE AND USE THE. p AYE SO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND ONE ASSET MANAGEMENT STANDARD ENGINEERING STANDARDS WHICH WE ALREADY USE PULL THEM ALL TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH. WHAT SHOULD OUR LOOK LIKE? WHAT'S EXPERTISE THAT WE EITHER HAVE DON'T HAVE OR NEED MORE. AND WHAT'S THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ENGINEERING AND SUPPORT STAFF THAT WE DO TO TAKE ON THESE MORE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT SO. THAT INITIATIVE. IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WILL KIND OF. FULFILL. THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE HUMAN FACTORS AYE. THAT WILL START BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY AND LEAD THE INDUSTRY ON FIXING. THE INDUSTRY LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO WE NEED TO CHANGE SO THERE IS A PLAN IN PLACE NOW. FOR OROVILLE SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT'S BE THAT THAT'S THE PLANNING STARTED IN MAY. IT STARTED IN JANUARY THE ACTUAL ASSESSMENT. AND WE ARE WORKING THROUGH FOR THE SOD AND WE'RE GETTING ANOTHER BORDER CONSULTANTS THAT WILL PRIMARILY LOOK AT ORVILLE. AND DO THESE DEEP DIVES FOR EVERY COMPONENT. DAMS. AND STRUCTURES SO FOR ORVILLE SPECIFICALLY THAT'S A TWO YEAR ASSESSMENT OUT OF IT WILL COME. PROJECTS TO BUILD ANOTHER SPILLWAY. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY? THE THE THE THE WHOLE DAMN ITSELF AND SO THOSE WILL BE OUR ROADMAP ON NOT JUST WHAT WE DO OR HELP CONSTRUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE TO BUT MODERNIZE IT IS YOU GUYS POINTED OUT. BUT THEN WHAT IS OUR ORGANIZATION LOOK LIKE BECAUSE WE HAVE MORE DAMS. AND THESE ASSESSMENTS HAVE ALREADY STARTED FOR THE REST OF THE DEPARTMENT DAMN DAMN ON HOME DAMN. DAMN OWNS. THAT WE HAVE AND THEN START TO A EFFORTS THERE ALSO. SWIM WISH WINTER. SO. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY IT BE. LINED WITH CONCRETE HOME EARLIER ON AND THAT THE AGENCY. DETERMINED THAT IT WASN'T NECESSARY. BOOKS. SO. WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING? WE TALK ABOUT THE CUT OFF WHILE WE TALKED ABOUT. IN SOME OF THE. THINGS TO GO FORWARD. BUT DO WE HAVE THAT SITUATION IN OTHER. DAMS IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE WHERE YOU'VE MADE A DETERMINATION WAS UNNECESSARY AND THEN. NOW YOU'RE AT RISK. WELL. TWO THINGS AND THEN YOU CAN. AND AS WELL. SO I JUST WANT TO ADD TO DOLE'S DISCUSSION OF A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF IN TERMS OF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY FOR OROVILLE. PART OF THE LIST OF POSSIBLE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT. WE WILL CIRCLE BACK TO THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY TO SEE BEYOND THE CUT OFF WALL IN THE IMMEDIATE ACTIVITIES. WHAT MORE SHOULD WE BE THINKING ABOUT DOING THERE SO WE'LL CIRCLE BACK TO THAT PARTICULAR ONE? IN TERMS OF OF OTHER SPILLWAYS ARE OR DAM FACILITIES IT MIGHT BE SIMILAR I AM I THINK THAT WILL COME OUT OF THESE. EVALUATIONS IT ARE BEING CONDUCTED ON NUMEROUS OTHER DAMS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN SIZE AGAIN AND DESIGN IN AN AGE SO THAT. THIS REEVALUATION. IDEA THAT'S. CAPTURED THEN DESCRIBE IN THE. PRINCE EIGHTEEN REPORT IS REALLY I THINK THIS NEXT WEEK WE STARTED TO DO THAT IT'S THE NEXT NEXT BIG STEP THAT GIVES US INFORMATION. PROBLY BETTER INFORMATION TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE MOVE AHEAD AND WHAT SORT OF ENHANCEMENTS WE MIGHT NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT IT THIS THIS POINT THAT WE HADN'T. I AM GOING TO GET TO THE NEXT PANEL BUT I THINK. AND GET THE QUESTION. OKAY. LESSIMPORTANT THAN THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE BUT I DO WANT TO I ASK. IN REGARDS TO BUY. THINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO SOME MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC A SPECIFIC ORVILLE. WHAT SUPPORT IS BEING GIVEN TO THE DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THE RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR NOT DIMINISHED AS THE RESULT OF THAT THIS? I HOW DOES THE W. ARE PLANNED TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS TO DOWNSTREAM COMMUNITIES SUCH AS SETTLEMENT BUILDING. NINE. OKAY WELL. WE ARE CURRENTLY HAVING DIALOGUE WITH MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES TO TALK ABOUT. THAT PARTICULAR ITEM AND AND A FEW OTHERS AND WE DON'T HAVE A FORMAL PLAN YET WE'RE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF AND. REALLY UNDERSTANDING. WHERE THE WHAT THE ISSUES ARE WHERE THEY LIE WHAT THE CAUSES HAVE BEEN? THAT HAVE LED TO THOSE PARTICULAR I'M ISSUES BUT. IT IS MY INTENT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AND. THERE IS A COALITION GOUP THAT HAS FORMS THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN MEETINGS WITH TO TO REALLY SORT THROUGH. THOSE PARTICULAR ITEMS THERE'S JUST A LOT OF. INFORMATION THAT NEEDS TO BE PULLED TOGETHER AND SORTED THROUGH TO KIND OF FIGURE OUT. AMONG OTHER THINGS WHAT CANDY W. R. DO IN TERMS OF OUR AUTHORITY WHAT OTHER AGENCIES OR ENTITIES MIGHT WE NEED TO ENGAGE IN THIS DIALOGUE WHICH WE HAVE STARTED OUT AS WELL TO TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT HOW IF WE WANT TO MOVE AHEAD WHO HAS TO BE INVOLVED. WHITES. YOU KNOW WHERE THE. OBSERVER HOWEVER YOU WANT TO DESCRIBE THAT THAT WE WE NEED TO GET THROUGH TO THEM REALLY. BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES. CAN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS A I'M AWARE THAT TO MANY OF THE EVACUEES HAVE SUBMITTED CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES. I THAT THEY'VE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE EVACUATION WHILE I KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES IS HANDLING THESE CLAIMS THE W. R. HAS INDICATED THAT WOULD SUPPORT LEGITIMATE CLAIMS. THAT'S FAR EVERY CLAIM HAS BEEN DENIED WHAT IS D. W. ARE. DONE TO SUPPORT CLAIMS BEING. I DONE AS A RESULT. SO THAT'S HOME. THE TOUGH QUESTION JUST IN TERMS OF THE G. D. GS AS ROLE IN THIS. AND YES CLAIMS HAVE BEEN DENIED THERE ALSO ARE. A COUPLE OF CLASS ACTION SUITS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED WHICH. I'M TOLD LIMITS ME IN MY ABILITY TO. SPEAK TOO MUCH TO THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC. GALLAGHER BRIEFLY. I THINK YOU MEANT CHAIR OF. THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS YOU KNOW AND AND I THINK ITS SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR ALL OF US. INSANE UP HERE BUT CERTAINLY. FOR MYSELF. HAVING BEEN AN EVACUEE MYSELF MY FAMILY WAS AFFECTED BY THIS INCIDENT. MY CONSTITUENTS. HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY. OVER THE YEARS YOU'RE NOT JUST THIS INCIDENT. BUT BY THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT. SO. WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR IS IS REALLY HEARING A FIRM COMMITMENT OUT OF D. W. ARE? TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS FRIENDS IT REPORT AND I JUST WANNA DETAIL. VERY QUICKLY YOU NO. I THINK MR FRANCE POINTED OUT TWO VERY BIG. THERE'S THAT THINK THERE'S THREE VERY FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS. THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THIS REPORT BUT THERE'S A LOT IN HERE BUT. THAT ONE IS THE GEOLOGY THE WHAT WHAT MR FRANCE CALLED THE MIS CHARACTERIZATION OF THE GEOLOGY. I THINK IN THE REPORT IT BECAUSE IT A MYTHOLOGY. REGARDING THE GEOLOGY THERE WAS A REPORT. DONE WHEN THIS DAM WAS BUILT THAT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED. WHETHER GROK IN THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY HILLSIDE. AND WHERE THE GATED SPILLWAY WAS DONE. AND OVER TIME. THIS VERY CLEARLY SHOWS IN THE REPORT THAT THE ORGANIZATION. AT SOME POINT CREATED THIS MYTHOLOGY THAT WAS ALL COMPANY ROCK AND THERE WERE NO PROBLEMS. AND IN FACT IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING THE FIRST PROCESS. THAT WAS BOLDLY ASSERTED THAT NO THIS IS COMPANY ARRIVED IN THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. AND THERE WON'T BE THE KIND OF HAD CUTTING EROSION. OF THAT WE SAW. IN FEBRUARY TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THAT WAS INCORRECT. AND SO THAT'S A BIG. THE A MONUMENTAL FAILURE I WOULD. I WOULD CALL IT. A OF THE ORGANIZATION. THERE WAS CLEARLY A DESIGN FLAW. IN THE ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE SPILLWAY. THAT NOT ONLY MR FRIENDS AND HIS TEAM IDENTIFIED IN THE EMBEDDED DRAINS AND NOT SUFFICIENT THICKNESS CRACKING THAT SOON APPEARED AFTER THE CONSTRUCTION OF IT. BUT PRETTY MUCH EVERY EXPERT THAT'S LOOKED AT THIS IS SAID THAT DESIGN WAS FLAWED. AND AT NO POINT IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. DID ANYBODY EVER GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT DESIGN AND SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE PROBLEMS HERE WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT'S A MONUMENTAL ORGANIZATIONAL. FAILURE. BUT WHAT I ALSO WANT TO GET TO IS THIS VERY CLEAR FINDING. AND. IN THE HUMAN FACTORS FRAMEWORK APPENDIX. PAGE J. TEN. THAT IS CLEARLY STATES DWI OR DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG DAM SAFETY CULTURE. AND DAM SAFETY DID NOT HAVE ADEQUATE PRIORITY RELATIVE TO NON SAFETY GOALS. SUCH AS DELIVERING WATER. GENERATING POWER AND CONTROLLING COSTS. AND IS SAID TO MR FRANCES OUT A PRETTY CLEAR. DEPICTION OF SOME OF THE HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING HERE. I THINK THERE'S ARE ALL CORRECT DEPICTIONS INTERPRETATIONS OF THE REPORT OKAY THANK YOU. AS A NOW TO THE W. ARE WHAT I WANT TO HEAR IS DO YOU AGREE. WITH THESE FINDINGS. OF THE INDEPENDENT FORENSIC REPORT OF OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN ORGANIZATIONAL PROBLEMS. AND I'M REALLY LOOKING FOR YES OR NO ANSWER. AND THE MUCH AND THE FOLLOW UP AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS OKAY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO TO TO ADDRESS? THOSE VERY CLEAR. PROBLEMS THAT HAVE BEEN SPELLED OUT IN THIS INDEPENDENT THE FORENSIC ANALYSIS. I WISH I COULD GIVE YOU AYE YES SERRANO I THINK MY ANSWER IS IN PART WE AGREE I THINK THERE ARE. SOME STATEMENTS IN THE FRIENDS EIGHTEEN REPORT THAT WE DON'T COMPLETELY AGREE WITH AT THIS POINT. BUT I CAN SAY THAT YES MOVING FORWARD WE ARE COMMITTED TO LOOKING AT FOR EXAMPLE AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE FULL REEVALUATION. UP OF THE SPILLWAY. THE OTHER ASSOCIATED STRUCTURES APPLYING IT TO OUR FACILITIES ASKING OTHER DAM OWNERS TO ALSO GO THROUGH THIS EXERCISE SO THAT WE CAN. MOVE FORWARD AND ADDRESS. THE ISSUES AND HAVE THAT DATA SAID. BE. CURRENT AND I KNOW ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT HAS TO DO WITH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT I THINK THAT'S VERY KEY AS WE MOVE ALONG. THIS IS THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THAT CANNOT GET LOST IT MUST BE PULLED FORWARD. EACH TIME WE DO INSPECTIONS EACH TIME WE'RE DOING SOME REPAIRS IT HAS TO BE LOOKED AT AGAIN I THINK THAT'S A CHANGE. ON THAT WE WILL INSTITUTE MOVING AHEAD THAT IS DIFFERENT. AND I BELIEVE ADDRESSES. COUPLE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT. OKAY BUT DO YOU BELIEVE THE YOU HAVE A SUFFICIENTLY STRONG DAM SAFETY CULTURE. RIGHT NOW. AND DOES IT ADEQUATELY PRIORITIZE DAM SAFETY RELATIVE TO THE NON SAFETY GOALS OF DELIVERING WATER GENERATING POWER CONTROLLING COSTS. I BELIEVE THAT WE DO PRIORITIZE DIEM SAFETY IS THE GROUP BIG ENOUGH NO WE HAVE. A CORE GROUP. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE. THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO BOLSTER THAT GROUP SO THAT WE CAN. AS WE MOVE FORWARD HAVE THE EXPERTISE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THIS DEEPER DIVE IN TERMS OF DAM SAFETY AND INSPECTIONS AND. CHANGES TO THE INDUSTRY STANDARDS THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL HAPPEN. SO. RIGHT OPINION IS IT IS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT WILL IT DOES IT. WARRANT SOME ENHANCEMENTS ABSOLUTELY. LET ME JUST GIVE HER A QUICK EXAMPLE THAT WAS IDENTIFIED REPORT MISTER FRIENDS MAYBE YOU CAN. HELP ELABORATE ON THIS DURING THE EMERGENCY INCIDENT. YOU IDENTIFY THAT THERE WAS TWO VERY CRITICAL DECISIONS MADE. REGARDING SENDING FLOWS DOWN THE REGULAR SPILLWAY THAT WAS BROKEN AT THE TIME. TWO KEY POINTS WHERE BASICALLY FLOWS WERE REDUCED. OR THEY WERE DELAYED. A BECAUSE THERE WAS TWO GROUPS. WITHIN THE W. ARE AT THE TIME. ONE THAT WAS SAYING. NON THAT THE GREATER RISK WAS LOSING THE POWER HOUSE. AND ANOTHER THAT WAS MUCHMORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. BECAUSE. AT THIS POINT THEY HAD ACTUALLY PULLED THAT YELLED YOU POURED OUT THE SHELF. AND PEOPLE WOULD SAID YOU KNOW WE GOT SOME REAL PROBLEMS WITH THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY TWO GROUPS. WHO? WORSE YOU KNOW AND ULTIMATELY THE GROUP THAT WANTED TO SAVE THE POWERHOUSE THAT THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS THE GREATER RISK ONE OUT. YOU DESCRIBE THAT IN THE. AT LEAST ONE OF THE REASONS. BEHIND THE DECISION TO SAY THE POWER HOUSE WAS THE CONCERN OVER WATER DELIVERIES. FOR LATER IN THE SUMMER OF THAT YEAR. IS IS THAT A CORRECT DEPICTION OF YOUR FINER THAN ME ELABORATE IS. HOWEVER YOU LIKE MR FRETS BUT IS THAT ONE OF THE. IS THAT AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE WE SAY THE. THE DAM SAFETY COMPONENT IS OUT OF BALANCE WITH OTHER NON SAFETY CONCERNS. BUT AGAIN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S. IT IS DIFFICULT PUT YOURSELF IN THE PLACE IN THE THE PLACE TO THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE ROOM THAT THE DEPICTION OF THE THE INFORMATION COMING FROM THE TWO SIDES IS CORRECT THAT'S WHAT WE HEARD IS THAT. THE DECISION MAKERS WERE BEING ADVISED. BY ONE GROUP THAT THE THE PARAMOUNT CONCERN WAS THE POWERHOUSE ANOTHER GROUP WAS VERY CONCERNED AND AND THOUGHT IT WAS A MORE IMPORTANT CONCERNED THAT WE NOT OPERATE THAT EMERGENCY SPILLWAY KNOWING WHAT THE NEW AT THAT POINT IN TIME. OF WHAT WENT INTO THAT DECISION AND THE CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS THAT GOOD MERCY SO IT WOULDN'T BE USED. THAT'S WHERE I WASN'T IN THE ROOM WHEN I DIE I DON'T KNOW SO I CAN ABSOLUTELY FALL THAT DECISION I MIGHT HAVE MADE THE SAME THING SAME DECISION AND AND IF I WERE IN THE SAME PLACE. IT IT IS A. BECAUSE IT WILL WE DON'T KNOW. IS EXACTLY. WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM BEING WHAT IT WAS WITHIN DWL R.. HAD IT HAD A HIGHER PROFILE WOULD ITS VOICE HAVE BEEN HEARD MORE LOUDLY AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT TIME PERHAPS YES. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S AN EXAMPLE PERHAPS AN EXAMPLE OF OF OF THE CULTURE. COULD SIDE OF SIDE OF THINGS. SO. IT'S I DON'T WANNA FAULT THAT THE CIVIC HAD WE'VE. WE TRIED TO WRITE THE REPORT AS CAREFUL AS WE COULD BUT SOMETHING SOMETIMES THING SCREAM OUT MORE LOUDLY THAT WE WANTED TO SCREAM OUT I THINK THIS MAY BE A BIT ONE WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO SAY WE WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT WAS A WRONG DECISION. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN EMERGENCIES LIKE THAT THERE AREN'T WRONG DECISIONS YOU'RE MAKING THE BEST DECISION YOU CAN WITH WHAT YOU KNOW. THEY THE CULTURE IDEA IS THAT HE GOES BACK TO THE CULTURE IN THE BALANCE. GOES BACK TO THIS QUESTION OF WHEN ANY ORGANIZATION HAS ITS LIMITS ON AN AMOUNT OF MONEY IT HAS IT HAS IT HAS AVAILABLE AND IT HAS DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES. AND WHILE WE'RE ALL WE'RE TRYING TO SAY THIS REPORTS WE THINK RIGHT NOW WITH WHERE THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM IS WITHIN THE O. M. ORGANIZATION. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT BEING AS FAR AS WE COULD UNDERSTAND REGULAR BRIEFINGS TO JOE OR ANOTHER EXECUTIVE. ON THE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM THAT IT PERHAPS IS IN GETTING ITS VOICE IN BALANCE WITH SOME OF THOSE OTHER OBJECTIVES AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HAVE A. BIT OF A LOUDER AND MORE PROMINENT VOICE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THEIR DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO THAT. A DIFFERENT WAYS FOR THAT TO HAPPEN AND THAT'S FOR THAT'S THE PUZZLE FOR DWI TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW BILL IT. AND THEN AND THEN PEOPLE WERE INVOLVED IN DAM SAFETY TO REALLY FEEL FREE THAT THEY CAN RAISE ISSUES. AND AND AND DAM SAFETY GETS ITS VOICE. SIMILAR IN GALLAGHER. AND CHAIRMAN IF YOU WOULD MIND I MEAN IF I COULD ADD A LITTLE BIT TO THAT I WAS IN THE ROOM NOT FOR EVERY MEETING WHILE THAT WAS GOING ON AND CHAO'S ACTUALLY GONNA GET TO THAT CERTAINLY COULD YOU KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW JOE YOU WERE PART OF THE. INCIDENT COMMAND YOU KNOW I MEAN I'M JUST. FOR APPENDIX CELL I THINK EVERYBODY ON THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK AT IT BECAUSE IT REALLY SHOWS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE TIMELINE. AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE GOING ON BUT I JUST READ FROM A COUPLE BUT CAN ARTS AND THERE IS AND I'LL ASK YOU KNOW ASK YOU TO RESPOND JEWELERS. AT ONE POINT EXECUTIVE SAYS THE PLANT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. IN TERMS OF PRIORITY ONE FEBRUARY TENTH THERE WAS A DECISION MADE. TO TAKE THE FLOWS THERE OF SPILL IS RUNNING AT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CFS. AT THAT TIME. AND THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY TALE REYES WAS GOING DOWN SO THE THREAT OF FLOODING TO THE POWER HOUSE. NOW WAS NOT A MINUTE AT THAT TIME IT WAS DECREASING. AT THAT TIME. AND THERE WAS A MANAGEMENT DECISION MADE. TO LOWER THE LEVELS FROM SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND A FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND IS DETAILED THAT. HAD THE KEPT RUNNING AT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TO EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. BUT THERE WAS A DECISION MADE TO LOWER BACK DOWN TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT DECISION WAS MADE. QUOTE HERE AND ON PAGE EL TEN THERE WAS SILENCE RATHER THAN EXPLICIT AGREEMENT. FROM MOST AND THOSE MOST PREVIOUSLY VOCAL IN THEIR OPPOSITION WERE NOT PART OF THE DECISION INCLUDING THE CHIEF DAM SAFETY OFFICER. THAT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT. THERE WHEN THAT DECISION WAS MADE. IT ALSO STATES THE INCIDENT COMMAND DISAGREED WITH THAT. DECISION. AND ALL. POINT TO THAT POINT IN THE. REPORT. I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW THAT. LEAH THE INCIDENT COMMAND THAT DISAGREE WITH THAT AND TRY TO OVERTURN MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT SAID THE DECISIONS ALREADY BEEN MADE. WE'RE KEEPING IT FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. CFS. YOU WERE INCIDENT COMMAND I BELIEVE DURING THAT POINT IS THAT DID YOU HAVE A DISAGREEMENT WITH MANAGEMENT OVER WHETHER NOT TO REDUCE THOSE FLOWS. SO I WAS NOT THE INCIDENT COMMANDER BUT I WAS PART OF THE INCIDENT COMMAND TEAM AND SO. HAVE I REALLY WANT TO STEP BACK AND PUT YOU IN THAT SITUATION BECAUSE I THINK I WAS NOT PART OF THE INTERVIEW SO I DON'T. WHAT WAS SAID TO THE FORENSICS TEAM AND WHAT THEIR DISCUSSIONS WERE AROUND HOW THEY CONCLUDED R. WROTE THAT BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM BEING A MEMBER THAT WAS UP THERE AND WAS AYE AT EVERY MEETING MEL? WAS I AND MANY MEETINGS AS WE WERE MAKING DECISIONS YES I THINK THE POINTS I CAN MAKE IS THAT. FROM FEBRUARY SEVENTH. FOR WAS ONSITE VSO DE WAS ON SITE. CONSULTANTS WERE ONSITE DAM SAFETY EXPERTS WERE ON SITE FROM THAT POINT FORWARD. EVERY DECISION. TO CHANGE THE FLOW OF THE SPILLWAY. WAS DONE WITH ALL THOSE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. THERE WAS IN MY RECOLLECTION AND WHERE I WAS THERE IT WAS NEVER A ONE PERSON DECISION IT WAS A CONSENSUS FOR BRINGING ENOUGH INFORMATION FROM ALL GROUPS. WHILE THERE WAS GEOLOGISTS THEY WERE SAYING AND THERE'S BAD ROCK IN THE. EMERGENCY SPILLWAY THERE WERE ALSO GEOLOGISTS WHO WERE SAYING AND. THERE'S BAD ROCK BAD ROCK UNDER THE SPILLWAY AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ERODE IT. SO THERE WAS RISKS IN ALL THOSE AREAS THAT WE WERE TRYING TO MANAGE IT WASN'T A SINGLE ONE THAT WAS BEING FOCUSED IS CAN WE FIND. FLOWS THAT MAKE THE WHOLE SITUATION AND COME OUT WITH THE BEST OUTCOME AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE WERE MANAGING THROUGH AND OBVIOUSLY IN A CRISIS. THERE'S INFORMATION FROM A LOT EXPERTS COMING IN FROM A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS IN THE HARD PART AT THAT MOMENT A TIME IS AT RISK IS HARD TO CALCULATE. AT EVERY MOMENT A TIME AND YOURS YOU'RE TAKING IN THAT INFILL MAKING DECISIONS SO THEY. WHEN WE DECIDED TO MOVE TO FLOWS FROM SIXTY FIVE TO FIFTY FIVE IT WAS BECAUSE THE MODELING WAS SHOWING THAT THAT. WAS ENOUGH TO KEEP THE WATER AWAY FROM FLOWING OVER THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. THAT WAS PUTTING THE IN THE. FLOOD CONTROL OUTLET SPILLWAY IN LESS RISK OF CONTAINING DO ROAD WHICH WE WERE SAYING SO WE WERE SEEN THAT HAPPENED IT WASN'T LIKE A RISK THAT COULD HAPPEN WE WERE SEEN CHUNKS OF A HUNDRED FEET. OF SPILLWAY. ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS IS BEING LOST AND WE HAD THOSE TRIGGERS OF. WE CANNOT LET IT GET TO A POINT. WHERE IT MAKES THAT SPILLWAYS UNSERVICEABLE AND NOW YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE? IT'S BASICALLY A RUN OF THE RIVER DAM WHERE WHATEVER'S COMING AND IS COMING OUT WE CANNOT AND THAT THERE SO. IT WAS TRYING TO MANAGE ALL RISKS. AND TAKE PUBLIC SAFETY AS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND FIND THAT SWEET SPOT WHERE IS EVERY DECISION PERFECT. I DON'T KNOW. BUT THEY WERE DECISIONS THAT WERE BEST A SITUATION THAT WE HAD AND I THINK THAT'S. KIND OF WHAT I HEARD THE FORENSICS TEAM SAY WHEN ASKED WOULD THEY DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT. RIGHT AND AGAIN I THINK IT'S BEEN SO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO YOU KNOW SECOND GUESS EVERY DECISION THAT WAS MADE IN THERE BUT THERE WERE DECISIONS BEING MADE IN THERE WAS A DECISION MADE ULTIMATELY. TO REDUCE THAT FLOW FROM SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CFS TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND CFS NO ONE AGAIN AND ALL THE DETAILS BUT. IT'S ALSO VERY CLEARLY SPELLED OUT HERE THAT THE EROSION AT THE SPILLWAY AND ACTUALLY STABILIZED AT THAT POINT. HAS HAD THE STABILIZATION OF THE POWER OF THE POWER LINE THAT PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. BUT. DID THE VERY CLEAR FINDING HERE IN NOT JUST RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY INCIDENT. BUT JUST ACROSS THE BOARD IS THAT PUBLIC SAFETY PRIORITY IS OUT OF BALANCE WITH OTHER NON SAFETY PRIORITIES THAT IS THE FINDING OF THIS REPORT. THAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT RIGHT MR FRANCE. THAT'S PERHAPS STATED A LITTLE MORE STRONGLY THAN I WOULD STATED OR I THINK THE REPORT STATES IT BUT. IT DID. THE DAM SAFETY WE THINK NEEDS A LOUDER VOICE THAN IT HAS. AND AND TO BE ISSUE TO BE MORE CONFIDENT THAT ALL THOSE. OBJECTIVES ARE IN BALANCE. AND WHAT I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM MISS YOU MR PATTERSON ASKED YOU A QUESTION YOU SAID WE DON'T QUITE AGREE THAT WE'RE OVERCONFIDENT. WE DON'T QUITE AGREE THAT WERE COMPLACENT. I'M HERE AND WE DON'T REALLY QUITE AGREE THAT WERE OUT OF BALANCE ON. PUBLIC SAFETY OF THE FIRST PART OF THIS WHOLE THING OF CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IS ADMITTING THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND THERE'S A LOT TO DO IN THIS AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME. BUT FIRST I WANT TO HEAR IDW R. WE AGREE WITH THESE FINDINGS. WE AGREE THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND WERE GOING TO. ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THESE AND OTHER SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS IN HERE. THAT ARE TWO D. W. ARE NOT TO THE INDUSTRY AT LARGE BUT TO D. W. ARE. ARE THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY YOU. AND WOULD YOU AND AND I AS JUST A QUICK FAULT THAT WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO HAVING MR FRANCE MAYBE THE FORENSIC TEAM OR AN OUTSIDE BODY STAY ON. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE IMPLEMENTED ADEQUATELY. OKAY WELL I WILL START SO WHILE I HAVE BEEN THE ONE WHO IS SAID I DON'T QUITE AGREE. ON THOSE VARIOUS FACETS. THERE IS. A PORTION IN ALL OF THOSE THAT I DO AGREE WITH AN EVEN IF I DON'T THIS IS. THE FOR THE. WE NEED TO TAKE A HALF STEP BACK WE NEED TO APPROACH THIS. FRESH EYES WITH EGO CHECKED AT THE DOOR WITH HEY THIS IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD ABOUT MAKING IMPROVEMENTS ENHANCEMENTS DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND HOW THAT CAN MODEL THE WAY. FOR THE INDUSTRY ITSELF SO YES WE ARE COMMITTED TO. IMPLEMENTING THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS REPORT DO WE HAVE ALL THAT SORTED OUT NOT QUITE YET WE'RE STILL GOING THROUGH THE REPORT ITSELF AS MR FRANCE SAID WE. WE'RE NOT GIVING. IN ADVANCE COPY THE DRAFT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT'S A WORSE STILL GOING THROUGH IT AND. FIGURE OUT WHAT OUR GAME PLAN IS. TWO MOVIES FOR AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD COME BACK. OBVIOUSLY BUT IT WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER BAKED WE CAN KIND OF LAY IT OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT. SO THERE IS A COMMITMENT I WILL SAY THAT YES TO IMPLEMENTING NOW ABOUT TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE EXPERT BODY. HELPING WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE. SO IS PART OF THIS A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT. WE ARE HIRING A. FLORIDA CONSULTANTS PER SE AND WILL AGAIN LIKE LIKE THE BORDER CONSOLES IN THE FORENSICS TEAM NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO THIS DANCE SAFETY ORGANIZATION. HAVE THEM PICK YOU KNOW THE EXPERTS IN THE WORLDAND HAVE THEM BE ANOTHER CONSOLE ABOARD A CONSULTANT'S BASICALLY TO REVIEW OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS YES. PRIVATE I MEAN BECAUSE WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THIS JEWEL THAT I THINK THERE'S MAYBE SOMETHING'S BEEN THE CONFERENCE OF NEEDS ASSESSMENTS ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURES ABOUT THE FACILITY UP THERE AND LOOKING AT ALL OF IT. AND WHAT MAYBE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED YOUR APPROVED. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ABOUT PROCESS OKAY SEE OTHERS AS WELL YOUR AYE AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S OTHER THINGS HERE INVOLVED IT. I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE OUTSIDE EXPERTS AS ONE OF THE CRITICISMS IS THAT YOU GUYS ARE AN INSULAR ORGANIZATION. NOW YOU YOU ARE THAT THERE'S AGREEMENT AND THAT SOMETIMES AGREEMENTS NOT RIGHT. SO HAVING. YOU NO OUTSIDE PEOPLE HELP GUIDE THAT AND SURE THESE THINGS ARE HAPPEN THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS WILL DO AND THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THERE IS A BORDER CONSULTANT SPEAKS ON THE ON THE. COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THAT'S MORE OF A VERY SPECIFIC POWER BILL BUT YES THERE WILL BE ABOARD A CONSULTANT LOOKS AT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON BOLSTERING. OUR OUR CULTURE OUR WHOLE DAM SAFETY PROGRAM SO THAT THERE WILL BE A SEPARATE SET OF. CONSULTANTS OUTSIDE EXPERTS WAYNE AND ON THAT. THANK YOU SKILLS. PROCURE. UM. AND YOU KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER REPRESENTS HEARING HE SAID HE WAS SOMEBODY WHO'S EVACUATED AND. CERTAINLY AS SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS A DELTA AND HIS WOULD BE. THE RECIPIENT OF ALL THAT WATER IF IT SHOULD. HE SHOULD HAVE COME DOWN EVERYTHING SHOULD HAVE FAILED. WE KNOW THAT. THIS IS AND YOU ARE MAKING IN REAL TIME. OR ARE IS A MUCH DIFFERENT SITUATION THAN REVIEWING. THINGS IN AND BEING ABLE TO SIT UP HERE. BUT I DO THINK THE RECOMMENDATIONS. I MEAN IF NOT HAVING A CONSULTANT DURING IMPLEMENTATION. I THINK ANOTHER FORENSIC LOOK AT THE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AND PERHAPS ANOTHER OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE HEARING. DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT HOW LONG THE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL TAKE AT THIS POINT. THAT'S. YEAH I WAS GONNA SAY FOUR TO SIX MONTHS. JUST WE GET HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S WELL THOUGHT OUT AT THE. BRING BACK OKAY. BENSON HURDLE SOMEONE TO MAKE UP. ASK A QUESTION BUT IT AGAINST IT WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL COMING UP ON DAM SAFETY WOULD YOU RATHER HOLD FOR THAT SEE THAT COMMITTEE OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK YOUR QUESTION NOW. OKAY. I'M LOOKING. THANK YOU CENTER OF. AND I THINK THAT CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEES FOR ALLOW ME TO BE HERE TODAY THIS IS NOT THE HOUSE AYE SERBIAN BUT. AS. WOULD ASSEMBLYMAN GALLAGHER I REPRESENT THE AREA AND WE'VE. OF CHALLENGES. UP. SEND EIGHT THAT WILL BE ONE OF THE ISSUES IS. THE STRUCTURE ON THE CULTURE OF THE ORGANIZATION NOW EVERY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY. GETS OSSIFIED BECOMES INSULAR WHATEVER IT HAPPENS. D. W. ARE IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE AND I THINK THE FORENSIC REPORT DID POINT THAT OUT FOR DECADES. LET ME ABOUT FIFTY YEARS. CERTAIN THINGS ARE NOT ATTENDED TO. WHAT INSPECTIONS DID OCCUR? SOME KIND OF THINGS DID NOT HAPPEN. ONE OF MY FIRST QUESTION IS DID YOU DO ANY BORING. BUSH BORE DOWN INTO THE FIRMAMENT AND TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON UNDERNEATH SEVEN THE GALLAGHER DID SOME RESEARCH AND JUST SUFFICE TO SAY THERE WAS NOT MUCH BORING DOT. MORE SURFACE INSPECTION. AND THEN NOT ATTENDING TO THOSE SIX. THAT BEING THE CASE THEN. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WHAT? KIND OF OVERSIGHT PROSPECTIVELY CAN OCCUR. ASSOCIATIONS TO. THAT DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ARE HIRING CONSULTANTS THAT'S FINE. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME OTHER MORE STRUCTURAL CHANGES NOW ONE OF THE DRASTIC ONES WOULD BE TO TAKE THE DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY AND HAVE IT NOT REPORT TO D. W. ARE BUT MAYBE DIRECTLY TO THE RESOURCE A SECRETARY. I'M JUST THROWING THAT OUT KIND OF RHETORICALLY NOT SAYING I PROPOSED IT. BUT IT'S A THOUGHT. AND. THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CHANGES. AND ON THE TIMELINE. THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE. SOMEONE GALLAGHER AND I HAVE COMMUNICATED TO THE FEDERAL AND DIRECTOR COMMISSION AND A BACK PERSONALLY HAVE MET WITH THEM. MEMBERS THEREOF. A WITH THE CONCERN ABOUT NOT PROCEEDING WITH THE CERTIFICATION UNTIL THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED AND HANDLED TO THE COMFORT OF. EVERYBODY. AND IN THEIR SUBMISSION TO YOU JANUARY TENTH. THEY ARE THAT THIS IS FOR FEDERAL INJURING HER COMMISSION. AT THEY ARE ASKING THAT YOU FORMING SUBMIT A COPY OF THE REPORT OF THE WRECKED FOR THE RECORD JUST FOR WITHIN THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS AND WAS WHICH. THE SUBSTANTIAL WITH THE SUBMITTAL PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INITIAL COMMENTS OR CLARIFICATIONS YOU MAY HAVE REGARDING REPORT. AND LASTLY A VERY IMPORTANTLY THEY SAY WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF THE LETTER SUBMIT A PLAN AND SCHEDULE TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS. NOW YOU'RE SAN FOR SIX MONTHS. THEY'RE ASKING FOR A PLAN. CAN YOU HAVE A PLAN SUBMITTED TO FOR WITHIN. THAT TIMELINE FORTY TO SIXTY DAYS A PAN OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED ABOUT THE DEFICIENCIES. TAKE CARE. I THINK YOU KNOW THE AND WE JUST GOT THAT LETTER THIS MORNING SO THANK YOU. YES WE WERE WE HAVE TO COMPLY SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN INTO THEM. THE DAYS BUT I THINK THE ADDED TIME THAT KIND I WHISPERED. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WAS SO THAT WE CAN TURN THAT PLANET WE TURN INTO FOR INTO MORE OF A STATE PLAN. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE GET IT DONE WITHIN THIS YOU KNOW OUR OUR INFRASTRUCTURE SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE OURSELVES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. TWO BE ABLE TO NOT GIVE YOU SEE MAYBE A HIGH LEVEL PLAN THAT WE BE TURNING AND FOR BUT MAYBE A MORE DETAILED PLAN THAT. IF YOU GUYS AT QUESTIONS WE GET ANSWERS SO WE DO INTEND TO DO THAT. THEN IT SPEECH GOTO AND AND I WAS GONNA SAY THANK YOU TO ALL THAT YES I THINK. THAT WOULD BE AN INITIAL HIGH LEVEL KIND OF SKETCHED OUT PLAN BUT. SORT OF EVEN BACK TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER PATTERSON'S QUESTION ABOUT WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT THE FOUR TO SIX MONTHS IN MY. MIND IS A PLAN THAT IS MORE DETAIL THAT REALLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT WE IDENTIFY CLEARLY WHO'S DOING WHAT WHAT ARE THE MECHANISMS TO IMPLEMENT TO ACCOUNT FOR TO REPORT SO IT WOULD BE A. A. MORE ROBUST PLAN IF YOU WILL DETAILED THAT REALLY SKETCHES THINGS OUT FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND ILLUSTRATES HOW WE'VE CHANGES WE'VE MADE. HOW WE MADE SHIFT SOME? ACTIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO PRIORITIZE WERE MOVED RESOURCES TO THIS PARTICULAR AREA SO I THINK IT'LL COME INTO FACES IS PROBABLY THE SHORT ANSWER TO LET ME DOWN EMPHASIZE SOMETHING THAT THAT I AM LOOKING FOR AN EXPECTED.AS YOU PROCEED PROSPECTIVELY TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS OF CHANGE. THAT THEY BE DONE IN AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS I ASKED THE QUESTION IN A RECENT MEETING WHERE THESE GOING TO BE IF MUCH. EMBODIED AND REGULATIONS AND EFFECTIVE THROUGH REGULATION AND IT WAS KIND OF THERE WAS RESISTANCE TO THE DEPARTMENT. IF YOU SEPARATE DO IT BY D. O. M. DEPARTMENT OPERATION MANUAL OR BUT BY EDICT WELL THAT'S NOT REALLY PERMIT. AND IT DOESN'T AND AND THE REASON I'M PUSHING SO HARD. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. IN SOCIETY IN CALIFORNIA BUT PARTICULAR IN THE AREA THE MOST AFFECTED. THERE'S NO TRUST. THE AGENCY IS NOT TRUST. AND I'LL SAY THAT SOMEONE GALLAGHER AND I DON'T. TRUST YOU EITHER IN MANY RESPECTS WE LIKE YOU PERSONALLY. AND EVEN GREAT UNDER THE PRESSURE YOU HAVE CUT TO CONTEND WITH INCREDIBLY. BUT THERE'S NO TRUST IN THAT HAS GOT TO BE ELEVATED AND IT'S GOT TO BE ELEVATED IN THE WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN BE ASSURED THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SUSTAINING. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WHAT YOU CAN AND REGULATION. BECAUSE IT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE PROCESS IS VERY FORMAL. AND THE PUBLIC DOES HAVE INPUT. AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE IT WITHOUT DOING ANOTHER REGULATION. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY WHATEVER YOU DO HAS GOT TO HAVE A STATUTORY FOUNDATION SO PLEASE DO. CONSIDER THAT. AS WE PROCEED AND LET JUST LET ME EMPHASIZE THAT THAT ISSUE. OF THE TRUST. AND THEN THE THAT. THE SILTATION. AND DREDGING OF THE CHANNELS. THIS IS BEEN A BIG ISSUE THOSE AFFECTED OUR FISHERY. AND WE GOT A HECK OF A PROBLEM THIS YEAR. OF A GOOD WATER YEAR. BUT A BAD YEAR FOR. KIND OF DESTROYING. HABITAT. FOR THE REWRITE. AND IS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF YOUR PLAN. DREDGING PARTS UP AND DOWN THAT RIVER NOW YOU DREDGED IN FRONT AT THE FOOT OF THE DAM AND THAT'S ALL OUT. BUT DOWNSTREAM THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF. BUT OF SELF. AND ACTUALLY YOU HAVE THE UP THE SNAG. MANY TREES WE WATCHING GO BY IN FRONT OF OUR HOUSE. RIGHT DOWN THE RIVER. THEY HANG UP AND THINGS THAT GO BUMP ON THAT WITH IS THAT GOING TO BE A PART OF ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES. BUT SOMETHING REGARDING GETTING THAT SILT AND THOSE. TREES OUT OF THE LA RIVER CHANNEL. SO I THINK THE WAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS AND AGAIN I'M SORRY I'M NOT GONNA GIVE YOU AN ABSOLUTE YES OR NO AT AT THIS POINT BUT IT'S IT'S KIND OF. RELATED SCHOOL SO WE HAVE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY DAM SAFETY. AND THE FACILITIES UP THERE EVERYTHING. THING THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH THE PRINCE AKEEM REPORT THAT WE'RE GONNA TO SET INTO MOTION. THERE'S ALSO THE LICENSE THAT. BRINGS AND OTHER ELEMENTS NOT HOME ENTIRELY UNRELATED BUT YOU KNOW. KIND OF. THE ADDED BENEFIT OF IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN. THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING WITH THE COALITION THAT WE WILL CONTINUE HAVE I KIND OF THINK OF RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL. THERE ARE ELEMENTS THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY RELATED. TO THE OTHER TWO BUT I THINK WE'RE STILL AT A POINT WHERE WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT. IF THEY'RE NOT HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THEM TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AND FOR ME I'M STILL KEEPING THAT ONE. SENTIMENT REMOVAL MAYBE THINGS LIKE SNAGS. IN THAT. THIRD LEG.- UNTIL WE CAN REALLY SORT OUT HOW OLD. HOW WE CAN MOVE AHEAD WHAT KIND OF ENHANCEMENTS IMPROVEMENTS COULD BE MADE THERE BECAUSE IT'S JUST? IT IT DOESN'T CLEANLY FIT JUST YET AND TO THE OTHER TWO AND THAT'S THAT'S BEEN. LAST POINT I'D MAKE IS IT AND I APPRECIATE THE YEAR AGREEMENT TO WORK WITH ME ON THIS CONCEPT. IT'S OVERSIGHT. AND IN THAT GOVERNS EVERYTHING BUT ONE ASPECT OFTHE OVERSIGHT THAT IS NECESSARY IS LOCAL. INVOLVEMENT. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE MOST AFFECTED BY WHAT GOES ON WITH THE DAM. AND A LOT MORE THAN JUST A HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND. ARE AFFECTED BY IT. AND IN FACT IT'S THE KIND OF THE KEY OF THE WHOLE STATE WATER PROJECT SO MANY MILLIONS. ARE AFFECTED BY BUT I HAVE SUGGESTED. SOME KIND OF A. NOT A FORMAL REGULATORY AUTHORITY WE DO NOT NEED ANYMORE OF THOSE. BUT A BODY PROSCRIBED BY LAW. WHERE BY PERIODICALLY THAT ENTITY NAY EACH? THE TALKS ABOUT THE ISSUES RELATED. TO THE OPERATION AND THE CONDUCT OF THE DAM. WE GET SOMETHING BACK IN THE EIGHTIES CALLED OF. MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. WHICH WAS SET UP DE FORMALIZED BY THE SACRAMENTO RIVER CONSERVATION FORUM. A GROUP OF LOCAL LEADERS AS WELL AS STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCY PEOPLE THAT REGULARLY MAKE. A. WOULD YOU CONSIDER SOME KIND OF AN ENTITY LIKE THAT TO HELP HAVE A GREATER COMFORT LEVEL IN TRUST FOR THE COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THAT RIVER. YES ABSOLUTELY LIKE CONSIDER THAT AND WE WOULD WELCOME THAT AS VEHICLE TO HELP US WITH INFORMATION FLOW WE ABSOLUTELY RECOGNIZE. SOMETIMES FOR MOST THE TIMES WHEN INFORMATION MIGHT BE COMING DIRECTLY FROM US INTO THE COMMUNITY. IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE BEST VEHICLE BY WHICH TO DO THAT SO A GROUP OR FORUM THAT COULD HELP US WITH THAT AND ALSO TOO YOU KNOW BOTH WAYS WOULD BE TWO WAY COMMUNICATION TO REALLY HELP US. STAY REALLY AWARE OF THE CONCERNS OR HAPPENINGS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT OR MAYBE YOU PERCEPTIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT TOGETHER WE CAN KIND OF WORK THROUGH SO YES I THINK WE WOULDWELCOME THAT. WELL AND THANK YOU FOR THIS YEAR DOING SOME THAT COMMUNITY FORUMS SIX THAT SEVERAL. THE IN THE AREA THAT WE REPRESENT THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL TO THEM. MADAM CHAIR THINKING. THANK YOU SENATOR OF YEAH I WOULD SAY THE AND YOU KNOW THAT THE THE REPUTATION THE AGENCY HAS UP IN THAT AREA IS IS NOT POSITIVE. WHICH I'M SURE MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT THAN FOR YOU TO GET INFORMATION OUT BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO DEVELOP A SHOULD. PLAN. BUT SOME AMBASSADORS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY INFORMATION BECAUSE WITH THE IN THE ABSENCE OF INFORMATION PEOPLE MAKE UP ALL KINDS OF. THINGS WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE FACE AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW TO THINK YOU SENATOR IN. A AGAIN TO BOTH THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT MEMBERS WHO REPRESENT THAT AREA WE. WE ARE SORRY THAT YOU ALL TO GO THROUGH THAT AND AND KNOW WHAT AT. A CRISIS IT WAS FOR ANY PUBLIC SERVANT THIS AS OUR HEARTS ARE OUT WITH THE. MEMBERS TO AND THE PEOPLE DOWN IN THE SENATE BARBER AREA RIGHT NOWTHEY'RE FACING BURST FIRES AND THEN NOW MUDSLIDES. MISTER LIKE WE WANTED ALSO IN LIGHT OF THE FORENSIC REPORT IS DUE TO WE ARE STILL EXPECTING FEMA. TO PAY FOR THE TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION RECOVERY EFFORT. SO. OBVIOUSLY IT IS OUR HOPE THAT YES WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR BOTH THE. EMERGENCY RECOVERY AND REPAIR AND RECOVERY STAGES WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH FEMA THEY HAVE ASKED OBVIOUSLY FOR THE REPORT AND FOR TIME TO GO THROUGH IT. ANDWE ARE SETTING UP AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS SO WE CAN COLLECTIVELY GO THROUGH IT AND ADDRESS ANY OF THEIR QUESTIONS I'M NOT SURE WHO ELSE THEY'RE REACHING OUT TO BUT. WE WANT TO CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR QUESTIONS ARE WITH THEIR CONCERNS MAY BE AND MOVE FORWARD FROM THERE. THREE MUCH OKAY. THREATEN THINK YOU AND I WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PANEL ON DAM SAFETY. AND I THINK. PROBABLY. CHIEF DIVERT YOUR STAND BECAUSE I HAVE I HAVE GRANT DAVIS UP AND THAT ERIK KOCH. INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT SHARON TAPIA CHIEF DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS. AND CHRISTINA CURRY DIPPY DIRECTOR PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY. BUT I WOULD ASK IF. THE PRISONERS COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE BRIEF IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS TO ALLOW SOME TIME FOR QUESTIONS. OKAY SO YOU'LL PROBABLY GRATEFUL THAT NO I WILL NOT E SAYING ANYTHING FOR THIS ONE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR COKE IS GONNA OPEN IT UP WITH SOME BRIEF REMARKS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO THE PRESENTATION SO. SO GOOD MORNING TEARS AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS OUR CO KIND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT HARM WATER RESOURCES. AT WHICH INCLUDES A DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS. WE'RE HERE TO. BURKE WERE HAPPY TO JOIN IN TODAY'S IT DISCUSS THE LESSONS LEARNED IN THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE DIVISION SAVED HIM DAM HAS MADE. AND WILL MAKE AS A RESULT THE LESSONS LEARNED. FROM FOR BILL INCIDENT. WITH ME TODAY IS SHARED HAPPIER. WHO IS OUR DIVISION CHIEF FOR THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS? AND TINA CURRY OF THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PLANNING PREPAREDNESS AND PREVENTION OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. I'M I'M GOING TO SORT OF CHOP UP MY PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT SOLVE DISCREDIT SKIP AROUND LITTLE BIT. AND. I'M REALLY ONE TO SAY THIS THOUGH THAT ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA. DIDN'T HAVE A STRONG DAM SAFETY REGULATORY PROGRAM. FINDINGS IN THE EYE OF T. REPORT AND OUR OWN OBSERVATIONS AS A RESULT OF OR BILL INCIDENT. DEMANDS A PARADIGM SHIFT MOVING FORWARD IN DAM SAFETY FOR CALIFORNIA. DAM SAFETY PROGRAMS HAVE PREVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON PREVENTING A CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF THE DAM ITSELF. DID NOT FULLY INCLUDE THE CONSEQUENCES CONSEQUENCES OF THE FAILURE OF APARTMENT STRUCTURES. INCLUDING SPILLWAYS EMERGENCY SPILLWAYS ALLEN BELTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE DAM. AS A SYSTEM. INSPECTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF STRONG DAM SAFETY PROGRAM. HOWEVER INSPECTIONS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH TO CONNECT THE DOTS. TO FIND MAJOR ISSUES UNDERLYING STRUCTURES. THE AUTHORITY HAS STRENGTHENED. ITS INSPECTION PRACTICES THROUGH MORE REGULAR AND DETAILED INSPECTIONS IN GREATER OVERSIGHT OF THE REPAIRS BEING PERFORMED AS A RESULT OF THOSE. BUT THAT AGAIN IN ITSELF WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. SYSTEMATIC ISSUES CAN ONLY BE IDENTIFIED. THROUGH A ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE REEVALUATION. REPORTS AND STUDIES. THE AUTHORITY HAS EXPANDED ITS VERY SUCCESSFUL EXISTING SEISMIC REEVALUATION PROGRAM. TO INCLUDE SPILLWAYS AND OTHER PERTINENT STRUCTURES. START DAM OWNERS OF NINETY THREE DAMS SPILLWAYS SIMILAR TO LIKE OR RELATIVES HAVE BEEN ENGAGED AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THEM AND ARE INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATING THEIR STRUCTURES AND THEIR PERMIT STRUCTURES. WITH MORE THAN HALF OF THE JURISDICTIONAL DAMS. BEING OVER FIFTY YEARS OLD WITH AN AVERAGE AGE. AB SEVENTY YEARS. MANY DAMS WILL NEED SOME LEVEL OF REPAIR. AND FOR SOME FOR REPLACEMENT. THIS WILL EQUATE TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS NEEDED TO REPAIR. AND BRING THESE FACILITIES UP TO CURRENT STANDARDS AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS. HOWEVER GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF DAM OWNERSHIP. FROM A SINGLE FARMER TWO MAJOR UTILITIES. AND THERE VARYING FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL RESOURCES MANY DAM OWNERS WILLBE CHALLENGED IN FIXING THEIR DOWNS. AS IS CURRENTLY THE CASE TODAY. THE RESULT IS THE FORCED IMPLEMENTATION OF RISK REDUCTION MEASURES SUCH AS RESERVOIR RESTRICTIONS. PARTIAL OR FULL DRAINING OF RESERVOIRS. WHICH IN TURN RESULTS IN THE LOSS OF NEEDED WATER SUPPLY IN CRITICAL FLOOD. PROTECTIONS STORAGE. WELL WE'RE SHIFTING THE PARADIGM OF THE NCP ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS NATIONALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. TO ACCOUNT FOR AND COUNTER THE LESSONS LEARNED AND ORVILLE. WE MUST ALSO RECOGNIZE INTELLECTUALLY OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS IN REPAIRING AND MAINTAINING OUR DAMS. WITH FUNDING PERMITTING RESEARCH AND DAM ORDER AND SAFETY EDUCATION. SO WITH THAT I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO SHARE AND WHO WILL GO FOR THE FLIGHT DECK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE. IT. IT IN YOUR PACKETS AND MOVE ALONG THEN TO TINA. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. AND IN YOUR PACKET I HAVE ABOUT TEN SLIDES NOW GO THROUGH PRETTY RAPIDLY. ERIC KINDA CAPTURE THE JUST OF IT BED IT'S KINDA NICE TO SEE SOME PHOTOS AND GRAPHICS TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. SO THE FIRST ONE IS OUR DAM SAFETY PROGRAM THAT. BIG CHANGES TO OUR PROGRAM HAVE OCCURRED HISTORICALLY THROUGH BIG SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCES AND AND FAILURES. AND WE STARTED OUR PROGRAM IN NINETEEN TWENTY NINE AS A RESULT OF THE SAINT FRANCIS STATE DAM FAILURE THAT OCCURRED THE YEAR PRIOR. THAT DAM FAILURE WILL BE HITTING ITS NINETIETH ANNIVERSARY IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. OVER FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. AND ANOTHER BIG CHANGE SAID THAT CHANGE BROUGHT ON THE REGULATION OF ON SCREEN DANCE. IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE THERE IS THE FAILURE OF THE OFF STREAM BALDWIN HILLS DAM IN THE LA AREA. IN THAT CAUSED THE LOSS OF FIVE FIVE PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. THIS AMENDED THE WATER COATING NOW INCLUDE OFF STREAM RESERVOIRS. AND DOWN BELOW YOU'LL SEE LOWER SAN FERNANDO WHICH AS MANY OF YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH. THIS ONE WE HAVE THE LOWER SAN FERNANDO EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE. YOU'LL SEE THAT. THERE'S EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE DOWNSTREAM OF THE STAND AND WHAT HAPPENED. LUCKILY AT THE TIME. R. DIVISION HAD HAD THIS DAMN RESTRICTED ACTUALLY FOR A DIFFERENT REASON IT WASN'T SEISMIC REASON. SO IT WAS RESTRICTED AND THE DAM OWNER ACTUALLY HAD HELD THE WATER EVEN LOWER. AND WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED HAD DUE TO HOW THIS DAM WAS BUILT IT. LIQUEFIED IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE STE UPSTREAM SLOPES LATE INTO THE RESERVOIR. AND SO THE WATER LEVEL HAD BEEN DOWN THIRTY FIVE FEET AT THAT TIME IN YOU CAN SEE THIS IS THAT THE RESULT THAT THE END OF THE EARTH QUAKE. IT WAS WITHIN FEET OF OVERTOPPING AND THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERED THIS EVACUATION. SO TO KEEP IN MIND WITH EARTHQUAKES AND LIKE WHAT WE SAW WITH ORVILLE ON THE FLIGHT EVENT THERE IS NO TIME TO EVACUATE. EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN INSTANTANEOUSLY. GOING ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE IS JUST A PICTURE OF OUR OVERALL INVENTORY WE HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED FORTY NINE DANCE. YOU'LL SEE IN THE LITTLE CHART THE VERY. FROM ORVILLE BEING OUR HIGHEST IS SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY AND THEY GO DOWN TO. VERY SMALL DAMS. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE AND. I HAVE VERY VARIETY OF TYPES OF DAMS TO. AT OUR OWNERSHIP OR OWNERSHIP IS ALSO VERY VARIED ACROSS THE STATE YOU'LL SEE THE CHART ON THE RIGHT. AND ALSO WHO HAS EXTREMELY HIGH IN HIGH DAMS. WE HAVE SOME OF THE LARGEST DAMS IN THE NATION THE MOST COMPLEX GEOLOGY AND VERY COMPLEX SEISMIC REGIME. AND WITH THEIR OWNERS THEY VERY BOTH TECHNICALLY AND IN THEIR RESOURCES FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT. ON THE NEXT SLIDE LITTLE BIT ABOUT EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SO I CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY PRIOR TO THE OROVILLE EVENT HAD BEEN ENCOURAGING DAM OWNERS TO HAVE THE KEYS IT WASN'T REQUIRED. THOUGH WE KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF IT AND PROBABLY AT THAT TIME CALIFORNIA WAS LAGGING IN THE NATION ON THIS. SO WE ENCOURAGE THEM WE SET OUT TO. NATIONALLY A LEARN ABOUT IT INUNDATION MAPPING TOOL THAT WE'VE BEEN YOU UTILIZING AND WE'RE ACTUALLY HELPING DAM OWNERS. DUTY EIGHT KEYS. SO FROM THAT WE AFTER THEY WERE RELEVANT NOW WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE INUNDATION MAPS WE LEARNED A LOT FROM MARVEL WE NEED SPECIALIZED MAPS FOR CRITICAL PRINCES. SO THAT YOU EVACUATION SCANNED BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES. AND NOT DISPLACED PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED TO BE DISPLACED. AND. THIRTEEN A NEXT MEAN SHE HAS NOW THE AUTHORITY TO REVIEW AND APPROVE. HE PEES DID PICTURE YOU SEE HERE IS ACTUALLY PARRIS DAM IT'S ONE IDW R. STAMP. AND YOU'LL SEE WE HAVE WE HAVE JUST DEVELOPMENT OCCURRING ALL ACROSS THE STATE JUST AT AT DID THE DOWNSTREAM TEARS OF THE STANDS TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS DbN LIKE LIKE THIS APP AT PARIS SO. WE DO HAVE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT IN CALIFORNIA IN REAL I HAVE A LOT OF LARGE DAMS BETTER UPSTREAM OF THESE COMMUNITIES EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IS VERY IMPORTANT. THE NEXT SLIDE IS JUST A QUICK SLIDE SHOWING OUR OVERVIEW. OF WE ARE ABLE TO LAUNCH THIS PROGRAM VERY RAPIDLY THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAD BEEN ENGAGED WITH OWNERS ON MAPS IN THE EIGHTIES. WE ALREADY HAVE THE TOOL ESTABLISHED AND WE HAVE A VERY STRUCTURED PROCESSAND HOW WE DO OUR DAM REVIEWS EMERGES FOLLOWING A VERY SIMILAR MECHANISM TO GET THE PROGRAM UP AND RUNNING. L. LITERALLY WE HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH INUNDATION MAPS. IN DECEMBER THEY BECOME AND BOXES TO US AND. AND I KNOW KALAYEH SAYS RECEIVING THE SAME BOXES. ON THE NEXT SLIDE SLIDE SIX IS JUST A QUICK STATUS OF OUR INUNDATION MAPPING PROGRAM. I DAM OWNERS ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THIS. THAT THEY'RE ON THE PHONE TWO S. QUITE QUITE A BIT. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE REQUIREMENTS IN WHAT THEY NEED TO DO WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE MAPS IN THE TIME LINES. WE KNOW THAT SOME DAM OWNERS LIKELY WILL NOT MEET THESE DEADLINES. AS SOME OF THEM DID NOT HAVE ANY AP IN MATH IN PLACE OF WHEN THE LEGISLATION WAS APPROVED. AND THEY ARE WORKING TO TO MEET THE DEADLINE SO SO OUR GOAL IS TO REALLY WORK WITH DAM OWNERS AND TO GET E. AP'S BECAUSE WE MEDIATE HE'S COMING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT THERE APPROVED IT SO THAT THEY'RE CORRECT IN ACCURATE IN CAN BE IN PLACE OF AN EMERGENCY WERE TO OCCUR TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. THE NEXT SLIDE IS SLIDE SEVEN. THIS GOES BACK TO INSPECTIONS AS WAS ALREADY DISCUSSED. BY MR FRANCE. INSPECTIONS IN OUR VIEW ARE ARE VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THEY'RE NOT THE AND ALL OF YOU REALLY GOT IT DO YOU DEEP RE EVALUATIONS TENDER STAND. BUT ONE THING I WANT TO POINT OUT ON INSPECTIONS IS IS THE VALUE THAT THEY HAVE. IS THAT THEY MAKE SURE THAT THE DAM OWNERS OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE DAM PROPERLY. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THERE IS A DAM FAILURE IN HAWAII WHERE SEVEN PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. BECAUSE THE STATE I HAD NOT BEEN OUT INSPECTING THE DAM IN NEW DAM OWNER TOOK OVER AND THEY ACTUALLY FILL THE SPILLWAY WITH DIRT. AND OF IN A STORM CAME THE DAM OVERTOPPED BECAUSE THE SPILLWAY WASN'T CLAIRE. SO WIVES ARE STILL BEING LOST AND. WITH INSPECTIONS NOT BEING DONE SO INSPECTIONS ARE IMPORTANT PART OF A GOOD DIEM SAFETY PROGRAM. WE ARE. BEING A MORE AGGRESSIVE ON OUR INSPECTIONS NOW WE'RE GONNA GIVE DAM OWNERS LESS TIME TO GET REPAIRS DONE. WE'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THOSE REPAIRS MORE CLOSELY. AND OF FOLLOWING UP AND TRACKING THAT EVERYTHING'S BEEN DONE PROPERLY. SLIDE EIGHT IS. A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF OUR REEVALUATION PROGRAM RE EVALUATIONS AREN'T NEW TO US. WE HAVE BEEN DOING THEM FOR DECADES THAT WE STARTED WITH THE LOWER SAN FERNANDO. HAD THAT WAS ACTUALLY STE A CHANGE IN INDUSTRY BECAUSE THE WHOLE MECHANISM OF UNDERSTANDING HOW SOILS LIQUEFY WAS LEARNED THROUGH THIS EVENT. AND ONCE THAT HAPPENED THE DIVISION DID. OF REEVALUATION STUDY OF ALL THE HYDRAULIC PHIL DANCE IN THE STATE. AND ALMOST NEARLY ALL OF THOSE ARE ARE FIXED NOW THERE'S A FEW. STILL OUT THERE THAT THE DAM OWNERS HAVE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND ARE NOT ABLE TO FIX BUT THOSE ARE RESTRICTED. AND NEXT UP WE HAD FULL SUMGAIT FAILURE AND AGAIN WE EVALUATED TWO HUNDRED DAMS. TWO HUNDRED GATES IN THE STATE. BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING IS IS CONTINUING ADVANCING AN EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING LIKE I SAID. EARTHQUAKES HAPPEN THERE'S NO NOTICE WE HAVE SO ANY DAMS IN THIS NOT JUST THE AGE OF THE DAMS IT'S SIERRA THAT THEY WERE CONSTRUCTED AND. SO WHEN YOU HAVE DANCE EVER CONSTRUCTED IN THE AIR THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND LIQUEFACTION YOU HAVE A LOT OF SOILS UNDER THE DAMN SICK COULD LIQUEFY. YOU HAVE SOILS WITHIN THE DAM THE CA LIQUEFY SO IT'S ON EARTH DAMS IT'S REALLY THAT CONSTRUCTION AT THE TIME THAT. AND THE METHODOLOGIES THAT WERE USED VERSUS A CONCRETE STRUCTURES ARE WE SEE THAT THAT'S AN AGING PROBLEM BUT IT. BEEN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING STANDARDS AND CODE REQUIREMENTS TO. AS SORT OUR CON OR EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING REEVALUATION PROGRAM LOOKS AT EARTH DAMS CONCRETE DAMS AND WE ALSO DO A PRINT AND STRUCTURES LIKE OUTLET TOWERS AND GATES. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY WITH ORVILLE WE STARTED THIS YEAR ANNEGRET VERY AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF LOOKING AT SPILLWAYS. AYE WE'RE STARTING WITH THESE NINETY THREE THIS IS A START. THIS IS NOT THE END ALL IN OUR INVENTORY WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. AT EACH YEAR TO GRAB ANOTHER BALK AT OF OF DAMS THAT WE CONSIDER THE HIGHEST PRIORITY. AND GET THOSE OWNERS ENGAGED. I DO WANT TO SAY AND I THINK WE'LL GET TO IT ON THE NEXT SLIDE. AND THE OWNERS ARE VERY ENGAGED IN THIS THIS. YOU TALKED ABOUT HIM ARE YOU AWAKE. EVERY DAMN OWNER OUT THERE IS AWAKE I WILL TELL YOU THAT. I WE HAVE DIEM OWNERS ALREADY. HAD ORVILLE NOT OCCURRED THE WAY IT DID. WE HAVE DIMINISH NOW. TELLING US ARE GONNA BE REPLACING THEIR SPILLWAYS. THEY UNDERSTAND THE SEVERITY OF THIS AND WHAT IT CAN LEAD TO SO I'M THERE THAT THE HEIGHTENED AWARENESS IS OF THIS IS OUT THERE. AND. BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THESE DO TAKE TIME. DOING THESE EVALUATIONS. REQUIRES US TO HAVE THEM GO OUT AND DO DRILLING TO GET THE DATA. AND AND TO REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S UNDER THERE AND HOW SERIOUS IS IT IS IT SERIOUS ENOUGH TO DO A FULL REPLACEMENT IS A PARTIAL REPLACEMENT SUFFICIENT. AND SO THESE PROJECTS DO TAKE. TIME TO EVALUATE AND THEN ONCE IT'S DETERMINED TO GOES INTO PLANNING THESE CAN TAKE A COUPLE YEARS OF PLANNING. THEN THE PER THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THE PERMITTING PROCESS THAT THEY HAVE TO GO TO AND THEN THE CONSTRUCTION SO YOU SEE FULL REPLACEMENT YOU MEAN THIS BILL LAWYER THE DAMN ARE YOU REFERRING TO SPILLWAYS YEAH SO THERE'S A AND. THEN THE SENATE CLAIRE AREA THERE ARE GONNA BE DOING A COMPLETE AND ALMOST DAM REPLACEMENT. AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA DO THE SPILLWAY ALONG WITH IT SO. AND THAT'S SURE THAT YOU SEE RIGHT HERE. BUT AGAIN IT'S IT WERE JUST FOLLOWING A AGAIN A IS A VERY STRUCTURED PROCESS THAT WE DO FOR SEISMIC AND THE SPILLWAYS HEARING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING OUTLETS. OUTLETS ARE ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING ON DANCE THAT DAY AGE THEY CORRODE WE GOTTA MAKE SURE OUR OUTLETS ARE GOOD AND WE GOT TO BE LOOKING AT DRAINAGE SYSTEMS AND DANCE BECAUSE THERE. THAT'S WHAT PROTECTS YOUR DAMNED IF YOU DO GET SOMETHING A WEEK GOING THROUGH AND EVERYTHING BANG THANK YOU NEED GOOD FILTERS. SO IT ARE. HAVE YOU TALKED MY ONLY THING IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HEARD BEFORE WAS THAT PEOPLE JUST LOOKING AT THE DAM THE STRUCTURE FAILURE VERSUS ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS THAT MAKE UP THE DAM SYSTEM. IF YOU WILL SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THESE NEW EVALUATIONS ARE YOU LOOKING AT IT HOLISTICALLY AS A DAM SYSTEM AND NOT JUST INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS. WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA BE DOING BOTH. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES LIKE ON SPILLWAYS YOU REALLY GAIN THAT EXPERTISE WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED AND AND AND YOU DIE DEEP IN YOU LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT IT. BUT WHAT THAT TYPICALLY OPENS UP IS YOU'RE LOOKING AT MORE THAN JUST THAT. A LOT OF TIMES WITH THEIR DANCE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SIZE MAKE IT AUTOMATICALLY MARKS IT YOU KNOW IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU DO YOUR HOUSE REMODEL IT IT IN MARCH BECAUSE YOUNG COVER THIS NEW AND COVER THAT. WELL OVER THERE YEAH. AND THAT THAT'S HOW IT HAPPENS BUT. KNOWING THE. YOU KNOW. KNOWING WHAT HAPPENED OR AVAIL AND HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT WAS AND IT WILL BE FOCUSED ON SPILLWAYS BUT IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. COMPREHENSIVELY MORE THAN THAT. IT'S GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING SPECIFIC TO THIS PRESENTER. OKAY I JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE SITES AND. MEANING YOU GUYS HAVE ALREADY STRESSED YOU GUYS KNOW THAT WE HAVE THE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND LACK OF INVESTMENT AND I DON'T NEED TO GO THROUGH THAT. AND BASICALLY THE COMMON THEMES WE SEE IS A DAMNING REGULATOR. THESE ARE TOP THREE IT'S IT'S THAT FUNDING MECHANISMS. DANNEMEYER OWNER SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS FOR DIFFERENT FUNDING MECHANISMS. THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE MAY HAVE A YOU KNOW P. ELI SINCE. THEY MAY NOT BE A SPECIALIST IN DAM SAFETY AND THERE THERE ISN'T A HUGE INDUSTRY OF DAM SAFETY EXPERTS. SO WE DO HAVE TO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CONSULTANTS THAT ARE DAM OWNERS CHOOSE. AND AND AND BRING THEM ALONG AND TO ENSURE THAT WE GET ADEQUATE PLANS AND SPECS. AND THEN LASTLY S THE PERMITTING. PERMITTING DOES. DOES TAKE TIME AND DAM IS SO WHERE THAT IMPEDE STAMMER NURSES THEY CAN'T GO OUT AND QUICKLY DO A REPAIR IF IF THEY SEE SOMETHING AND IF THEY HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT YEAR IT REALLY HAS TO BE PLANNED OUT IN ADVANCE. AND THEN AGAIN ON THAT SIDE YOU SEE ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPES OWNERS SO AGAIN THEY EACH HAVE THEIR OWN ABILITY AND KNOWING HOW TO DO EACH OF THESE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS. AND THEN LASTLY ADVANCING DAM SAFETY THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM IS BEEN VERY PROACTIVE AND NAY NATIONALLY IN PROMOTING DAM SAFETY. FROM THE NATIONAL THEM SAFETY REVIEW BOARD WERE VERY INVOLVED IN ASSOCIATION STATE DAM OFFICIALS. AS WELL AS THEM WITH HOMELAND SECURITY. YOU KNOW THERE DEBT DEFINITELY ARE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING IN OUR PROGRAM GOING FORWARD LIKE I MENTIONED ABOUT THE INSPECTIONS. AND REALLY HAVING ALL OF OUR ENGINEERS HAVE THAT AWARENESS WHEN THEY GO OUT AND LET THEM DO THEIR INSPECTIONS AND. AND WE ALWAYS DO THAT DEEP DIVE. WHEN WE DO OUR RE EVALUATIONS AND IT'S AMAZING R. GETS UNCOVERED WHEN YOU DO THAT. THAT'S A. BUT NOW IT'S AFTERNOON SO GOOD AFTERNOON. CHAIRS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'LL BE BRIEF. THAT NINETEEN AQUARIUM A DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH THAT CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM D. W. ARE AND TO PRESENT TO YOU WHAT OUR ROLE IS IN IN DAM SAFETY. BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED FROM OROVILLE AND JUST A VERY. SMALL SMALL BIT ABOUT CALLAWAY YES ON OCCASION NOT TOO FAMILIAR WITH WHAT WE ARE THAT YOU PROBABLY ARE TO HAVE A LOT OF EMERGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS YEAR BUT WE ARE A STATE AGENCY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSISTING WITH ALL ASPECTS OF EMERGENCIES FOR ALL HAZARDS IN CALIFORNIA WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHEN WE NEED TO BRING THEM INTO HEALTH WORKING ACROSS STATE GOVERNMENT TO BRING IN EXPERTISE AND OF COURSE ALL OF IT IN SUPPORT OF COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE'VE BEEN ACTIVATED. I THINK ABOUT A THIRD OF THE YEAR. IN RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES WERE ACTIVATED RIGHT NOW IN RESPONSE TO THE ON GOING ON FIRE THAT IS AND LEAD TO THE THE MUTTS LIGHTS ON BUT ON BALANCE WITH THAT I'M PART OF DALLAS IS ROLE IS TO ALSO. FACILITATE EMERGE READINESS FOR EMERGENCIES EMERGENCY PLANNING. PREVENTION. OR LEAST MITIGATION AGAINST EMERGENCIES. AND THAT'S WHERE WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT NEEDED TO CHANGE ENDING ADVANCES. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. IMPORTANT AND THE WORK THEY DID IF YOU ARE STILL MANY. THINGS HAPPENED AND WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR EMERGENCIES BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A REALITY IN OUR STATE. I'VE HANDED OUT A VERY. SIMPLE. INFOGRAPHIC ABOUT EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS AND. TO HELP IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THESE ARE SIMPLE DOCUMENTS BUT JUST KINDA GIVING IDEA WHAT THE COMPONENTS ARE. OF THESE SO YOU CAN GET A FLAVOR OF WHAT IT IS WE'RE GOING TO BE RECEIVING WE HAVE BEEN GETTING LOTS OF A BOXES INDUSTRY IS TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AND THAT RESPONDING. AND. WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT IT. IN LEVERAGING OUR EXPERTISE AND. LOOKING FOR THESE COMPONENTS AND THAT THING ABOUT PLANS IS THEY ARE IMPORTANT TO HAVE THEY HAVE VERY SPECIFIC ELEMENTS TO THEM AND WE WANT TO SEE THAT STANDARDIZED. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S LOTS OF DAMS IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN BE FOUND BY THIS BY THIS RULE AND. YOU KNOW WE WE ARE BUT AS IMPORTANT AS THE PLAN ITSELF IS THE PROCESS THAT. THAT IT IT. E. UM THE RESPONSIBLE ENTITY GOES THROUGH TO DO THAT AND THEY HAVE TO INVOLVE ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT. WILL BE AFFECTED BY THAT PLAN MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THAT EMERGENCY AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO HELP FACILITATE DAM OWNERS DO. BUT ACTUALLY BE CHECKING FOR WHEN WE REVIEW THEM AND THEN TATIAN THAT THAT WILL BE DONE. WITH WITH A CERTAIN FREQUENCY SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA'S WORKS WITH THEM LOCAL GOVERNMENT NOW ON TO DO EXERCISE A FOR EMERGENCIES. WE HAVE A WARNING CENTER THAT IS. BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO DOING. YOU KNOW PASSING ON EMERGENCY INFORMATION FOR WHETHER FOR FIRES EARTHQUAKES SO ALL OF THAT EXISTS WITHIN CALLAWAY US SO WE WILL BE APPLYING THAT TOWARDS OUR OUR VIEW ON THESE AND DAM. EMERGENCY ACTION PLANS. SO WE OUT MEAN I'D I WON'T GO THROUGH ALLTHE DETAILS ABOUT YOU KNOW HOW LONG WE HAVE TO REQUIRE WHAT WILL GO THROUGH IT IS NEW WE'RE JUST GETTING OUR FIRST BATCH OF THEM SO WE'RE GONNA LEARN A LOT IN THE PROCESS. THAT WE HAVE SET UP SOME TOOLS TO EVALUATE THESE IN A CONSISTENT WAY TO BRING IN EXPERTISE ACROSS OUR AGENCY WE HAVE A FIRE AND RESCUE DIVISION WE HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION WE HAVE. A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DIVISION THEY BY EXTENSION HAVE REACH OUT INTO. VARIOUS FIELDS AND CAN HELP US AND FORM. THESE PLANTS AND WE WANT THEM TO BE GOOD YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T IT AT GOTCHA WHERE WE'RE GOING TO BE I'M TRYING TO TO TO CATCH THINGS WE WANT TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH DAM OWNERS WORK A COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PLANS ARE UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE EFFECTIVE WITH. THEIR TESTED AND THE END OF THE DAY THE PUBLIC HOUSE HAS COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA THE DAM OWNERS AND WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY AND WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE EVEN MORE SO NOW WE MEET. WEEKLY MAYBE ARE FREQUENTLY THAN THAT WITH THE DIVISION OF SAFETY OF DAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE SHARING INFORMATION AND. WE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE RECEIVING WHAT THEY'RE SEEING ON THE MAPS WE THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE RECEIVING OVERSEEING ON THE PLANS ARE WORKING TOGETHER BECAUSE THE COMMUNICATIONTO THAT STAKEHOLDERS TO THE COMMUNITIES AS THESE. AS A SPAWNING GOES UNDER WAY ISN'T THESE PROGRAM ENHANCES. COME ABOUT BUT AND AND YOU KNOW AND COMMUNICATION FROM OUR DIFFERENT AGENCIES ON THIS TOPIC THAT THAT'S ALL AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE AND ELIMINATING. ANY CONFUSION R. OR I'M CROSS WIRES IS VERY RIGID TIME FRAMES WITH THESE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE MOVING FAST BUT WE STILL NEED TO BE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AND. AND SHOW THAT WORKING TOGETHER SO SO REALLY I THINK THAT THAT THE VALUE THAT WE ADD IS. AS WE DIG INTO THESE PLANS WE START TALKING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES ABOUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THESE EDUCATING THEM ABOUT THESE PLANS. WORKING WITH DAM OWNERS ON THE EXERCISES AGAIN ARE REALLY GONNA. YOU HOPE TO SEE THAT THAT. THAT THE ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE RECOGNIZE ARE NEEDED REALLY STARTED TO PLAY OUT IN THE MONTHS AND AND. YEARS AHEAD IN THEIR ALL HAZARDS PLAN UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS TO EVACUATE. COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE YOU KNOW WE HAVE FLOODS WE'VE HAD THE FIRES WE'VE. WE'VE HAD. THE MUD SLIDES AND SO HERE'S ANOTHER YOU KNOW KIND OF I HAVE. RISK IN WHICH THAT TYPE OF ACTIVITY SO THERE'S THERE'S A NEED TO BE CONSISTENT AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC YOU CAN ON HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK. AND. BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF HAUSER'S THAT THEY'RE EXPOSED TO AND. I THINK ARE AND BE ABLE TO SORT OF FOLD THIS INTO THE FRAMEWORK OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AND A ROLE THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE. ARE EXPECTED TO DO QUITE FRANKLY AND JUST AGAIN. THE MERCY ACTION PLAN THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO INCLUDE SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK WERE TALKED ABOUT IN THE PANEL LIKE OUR YOU KNOW HOW IS SOMEBODY GOING TO KNOW SOMETHING'S WRONG. WHO ARE YOU GOING TO TELL? THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT TIERS OF EMERGENCIES POTENTIALLY BECAUSE THERE'S THE MAIN DOWN AND NOW WE KNOW YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAY MAY BE. WHILE STILL SERIOUS MIGHT KIND OF HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY THAT THAT EMERGENCY COULD PLAY OUT SO. ROLESAND RESPONSIBILITIES WHO DOES WIDE. UP AT DEFINING THE RESPONSE PROCESS STEP ONE THREE STEP TEN YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT IS THAT'S CLEARLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AROUND THE EMERGENCY EVENTS WHETHER WHETHER DAM OWNERS GOING THE FLIGHT IMPACT. THAN THAT OF COURSE DRIVES THE EMERGENCY PLAN SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE BASIC COMPONENTS. YOU KNOW THESE ARE YOU KNOW WE EXPECT TO GET REALLY LARGE DOCUMENTS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF DETAIL OUT OF FACILITIES YOU KNOW WITHIN EACH DAM. THE YOU KNOW WE WE THINK WE HAVE A GOOD. START TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THESE AS HIS COMMANDED AND LEARN FROM THE PROCESSES WE GO SO OUT STOP THERE I KNOW THERE'S QUESTIONS AND. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER AND I THINK ANY OF US. SLIGHTLY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE GOOD FOR US AT THIS POINT THINK AGAIN THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR WE SHOULD HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BONUS TO HER THOUSAND PEOPLE EVACUATED. WITH NO LOSS OF LIFE. WAS TALKING WITH THE DIRECTOR OF CAL THAT ABOUT HIS SECRETIVE CALVET ABOUT WHEN HAD EVACUATED THE NAPA HOSPITAL ME ANYTIME YOU SEEN THAT ONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU EVACUATE SENIOR FRAGILE I HAD PEOPLE FROM NURSING HOMES IT IS INCREDIBLY A DANGEROUS AND AND AND YOU KNOW YOU TAKE A NINETY FIVE ROLLED OUT WITH WITH WITH PNEUMONIA NEITHER THINKS. THAT'S HOW A LOT OF LOS WHAT HAPPENED SO THAT IT DIDN'T OCCUR IN THE SITUATION I THINK IS QUITE REMARKABLE. ON. QUESTION FROM A GREAT. YEAH THINK ABOUT YOUR AND ALSO DID WANNA JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON ON ALL THESE ISSUES WERE. ACTUALLY CO AUTHORING LEGISLATION WITH SENATOR NIELSEN S. ELDERLY PEOPLE BEING EVACUATED TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. YOU KNOW WAS ADDRESSED ADEQUATELY WAS DEATHLY SOME WE FOUND THAT WE KNOW WE CAN DO BETTER ON. ASSUME THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT. COUPLE THINGS I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON I I THINK I HEARD THAT WE ARE GOING TO NOW HAVE AN EXECUTIVE IT DO YOU HAVE YOU ARE. THAT IS FOCUSED ON DAM SAFETY. SPECIFICALLY IS THAT CORRECT. AND WHO IS THAT I GUESS NOW. OPEN SO FOR ORACLE THERE WILL BE A SPECIFIC EXECUTIVE LEVEL POINT PERSON WHICH IS TED CRADDICK WHO. MIGHT. WHO HE SITTING BACK HERE IN THE AUDIENCESO? FOR DAM SAFETY. DEPARTMENT WIDE. YES FOR THE REGULATORY SIDE OF THINGS SCARE COKE. AND. SHARON. OKAY DEBT AND AS AS HAD OF DS SO DE AND THEN AS THAT OF THE INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT OKAY. YOU MENTIONED THE FOURSOME GAVE FAILURE. A MISSTEP VIA AND I KNOW AND THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE A THIS PROBLEMS WITH ANCHOR TENANT RODS THAT ARE AGED. WHAT'S THE STATUS OF WAR BILLS. ACRE TEN IN RAZA KNOW THAT WAS THERE SIMILAR AGE AS FULSOME. AND HAVE WE REPLACE THOSE YET WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THOSE. AND. SO WITH WITH FULL SUMGAIT THE ACTUAL. FAILURE MECHANISM WAS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME INDUSTRY AND THAT WAS. THE TRUNNION FRICTION. SO IT'S ACTUALLY WHERE THE GATE ROTATES AND THAT FRICTION BECAUSE OF THAT THE TRUNNION PENS WEREN'T PROPERLY MAINTAINED. THE FRICTION GOT TOO HIGH IN THAT'S WHAT CAUSED THE GATE TO BUYING DE. UM AND THEN WHEN IT FINDS THAT THEN IT EFFECTS THE TENDONS BUT TENANTS ARE IN AN INDUSTRY ISSUE. BECAUSE THERE EMBEDDED INTO CONCRETE. AND. AND THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO RETROFIT. AND SO I KNOW THE ONES THAT OROVILLE ARE BEING EVALUATED. NOT TOO LONG AGO I. THINK JUST A MONTH OR TWO AGO THAT AND. D. W. R. HAD A WORKSHOP ON IT AND I HAD SOME OF OUR STRUCTURAL EXPERTS IN OUR DIVISION ATTENDED SO WE'RE FOLLOWING ALONG WITH D. W. ARE. WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH IT? I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DEFINITE PLAN YET THEY'RE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. BUT OF REPLACING TENDONS. I THINK YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE. MAYBE PROBABLY WHATEVER COMES OUT OF D. W. ARE. COULD LEAD THE NATION AND AND IN THE TECHNOLOGY OF HOW TO FIX THESE YEAH I WOULD STEPS AS IT DOES ON THE NEEDS ATTENTION AND FOLLOW UP FROM D. SOD I KNOW THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW WITH THE ANCHOR ATTENDANCE AT OR. YEAH. WHO IS LOOK WHO WAS THE HEAD OF THE ON AND DIVISION? VIA DURING THIS INCIDENT CRISIS. IDW OR. SO THE FORMER DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR STATE WATER PROJECT THAT MARC ANDERSON AT THE TIME WHO'S AHEAD OF THEIR OWN AND DIVISION. SORRY ESTATE TO POP I KNOW THESE NAMES I I PROMISE SO. BUT DAVE DAVE DIVALL IS THE HEAD OF THE ON M. SECTION AND THERE IS A DIEM SAFETY GROUP THAT IS PART OF THAT THAT. I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE ARTICULATED IS SEPARATE FROM. THE DIVISION OF SAY RIGHT IN THERE'S IT STANDS SAFETY ENGINEER. ARE IS IT YOU KNOW I THINK DOES THE TERM. THAT IS THAT DAVE IS WELL THAT'S DAVE PANIC ROOM. DAVE CONNECTED YES WE A LOT OF DAYS OKAY S. DAVE AND THEN THE HEAD OF THE. OH NAM IS DAVE DO LAWS CURRENTLY STILL CURRENTLY YES OKAY. AS AND. WHO HAD COURTS TO CHILL AND THEN THE OVERALL HEAD OF THAT DEVELOP THAT? THAT. BIGGEST OF STATE WATER PROJECT WAS MARK ANDERSON IS NOW RETIRED IS THAT YES OKAY YES ANGELES TAKEN HIS PLACE CORRECT IS ONE TO CLARIFY THAT YEAH. AS SOON AS THE DAM SAFETY ENGINEER GONNA PLAY A LARGER ROLE IN THE NEW KIND OF LIKE DAM SAFETY. COMPONENT HERE IS THAT OR IS IT ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WAY. WELL I THINK THAT'S IN. THOUGH OKAY WELL AND. CLAIRE FUSIONS BUT I'M HARKENING BACK TO THE. INDEPENDENT FORENSIC TEAM REPORT IN THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CHIEF. DAM SAFETY ENGINEER IN THERE SO. WE WILL. FIND WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION. I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE COMMENTS OF THE REPORTS I WANNA RUN THAT TO TO GROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER ISSUES THAT WE MAY HAVE THEIR THAT WE RESOLVE THAT THERE IS. HE NO NO HINDRANCE TO COMMUNICATIONS GOING UP. FROM THE DAM SAFETY ENGINEER TO. MYSELF THE DIRECTOR JOEL. SO THAT WILL BE IN AREA WE WILL FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN JUST LAST QUESTION IS A YOU KNOW ONE OF THE FINDINGS. SPECIFIC TO THE STATE WATER PROJECT IN THE IN THE. FRIENDS REPORT WAS. AND OF THIS QUOTE FROM AT THE IFD FOUND THE DWI WAS LIKELY SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRESSURES. BY THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS TO CONTROL COSTS. IN THESE PRESSURES WERE EXERTED IN VARIOUS WAYS SUCH AS OPENLY DURING DISCUSSIONS. IN MEETINGS. GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF HOW WE MAKE SURE WE MANAGE THE STATE WATER PROJECT ENSURE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS NUMBER ONE. HOW DO WE TAKE YOU KNOW THESE? YOU KNOW INFLUENCES FROM THE CONTRACTORS AND COST PRESSURES HOW DO WE TAKE THAT OUT OF THE EQUATION. BECAUSE I THINK PROBABLY MOST PEOPLE HERE SAYING LOOK FROM HERE ON OUT WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE FROM SAFETY HOWEVER THAT'S A TERM AND WHETHER IT'S BY THE. DAM SAFETY ENGINEER. NEO BY THE NEW. THAT. SYSTEM THAT WE'RE GONNA SET UP. DEAD THAT JUST GETS DONE AND IT'S NOT THERE'S NO DEBATE WITH THE BENEFICIARIES OVER WHAT WHAT THE COST SHOULD BE. IT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND THAT IS AGAIN AND THEN THEREFORE BE PAID FOR BY. THE BENEFICIARY MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DISCUSSED. AND IS. I MEAN IS TO YOU IS THAT EVEN AN ISSUE. TO BE ADDRESSED BUT. HOPEFULLY IT IS BEING ADDRESSED. BUT YOU KNOW D. W. R. WE MAKE OUR DECISIONS IN TERMS OF PRIORITIZING. MAINTENANCE ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE ARE IN CONTINUAL COMMUNICATION WITH THE CONTRACTORS JUST IN TERMS OF LETTING. AT FOR PLANNING PURPOSES BILLING PURPOSES. SO WE HAVE DIALOGUE AND TERMS OF HERE'S WHAT'S ON TAP FOR THE UPCOMING YEAR WE'VE GOT SOME PRIORITIES IN TERMS OF MAINTENANCE. I THINK BUT WE MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AND WE IMPLEMENT THEM. I THINK PART OF WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT TO IMPROVE THAT IS THIS IN PART THE COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THE ASSET MANAGEMENT. EFFORT THAT JEWEL DESCRIBED EARLIER WHERE WE WILL. TAKE OF MORE ROBUST LOOK AT. AND OF COURSE REALLY DO THIS DEEPER DIVE RIGHT WITH THROUGH THE RE EVALUATIONS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LIST OF ASSETS THAT WE THAT NEED MAINTENANCE MAYBE THEY NEED REPLACEMENT REPAIRS. PRIORITIZE THOSE BASED ON RISK BASED ON NEED AND THAT SO WERE FOR OUR PART GOING TO HAVE A MORE ROBUST PLANNING. AND PRIORITIZING PROCESS WE WILL STILL COMMUNICATE THAT OBVIOUSLY. WITH THE CONTRACTORS BUT. THIS IS. OUR PROCESS IT IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE NEED TO. MAKE THOSE REPAIRS AND DO AND. MAKE THOSE IN A TIMELY MANNER OBVIOUSLY. RIGHT ISSUE AND IS A REAL QUICK FOLLOW UP ON THAT IS YOU KNOW WOULD YOU CAN SEE YOU SO THERE'S A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU GUYS IN THE WATER CONTRACTORS. YOU IN THE CASE OF THE P. YOU SEE WE'VE WE'VE SAID HEY YOU KNOW PC IMPEDE YOU NEED IF YOU GUYS GONNA BE COMMUNICATING REGARDING THINGS NO EX PARTE COMMUNICATIONS AND THE PUBLIC. I MEAN SHOULD WE HAVE A SIMILAR PROCESS IN PLACE. IF YOU'RE COMMUNICATE ALL THE TIME ESPECIALLY AS REGARDS TO WHAT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF OWN. THAT THOSE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BE MADE PUBLIC IN THE THERE ARE NO EX PARTE COMMUNICATION. WELL. CURRENT SOMETHING TO CONSIDER BUT I THINK THAT. THE DIALOGUE WE HAVE BEEN HAVING IN THE STRUCTURING HAVE IT UNDER WORKS I MEAN I THINK A PART OF WE NEED TO WE HAVE REGULARLY. SCHEDULED MEETINGS IN WHICH WE. TALK WITH THE CONTRACTORS IN PART IS THEY NEED TO PLAN FOR UPCOMING EXPENSES AND BILLS AND CHANGES IN THE BILL SO. THAT NECESSITATES THE NEED TO REALLY. BRING THEM ALONG IN THESE PLANNING. EFFORTS AND AS WE KNOW BIGGER EXPENSES ARE COMING DOWN THE LINE WE NEED IT WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE THEM TIME TO. I JUST THEIR BUDGETS AND AND WHAT NOT TO A ADDRESS A BILLS WHEN THEY COME AND. SO. IN IT WE KNOW THERE'S A LOT I NEED AROUND THE STATE AND WE'RE STARTING TO GET A LOT MORE INFORMATION ON THAT AND I THINK THAT I MEAN THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT I REACHED ON. ON NOW THE OROVILLE TOUR AS WELL. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFICIARIES ARE PAYING FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE UPDATE AND EVERYTHING AS WE'RE GOING FORWARD? AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE STILL. MOVE NEED TO PUT HAVE A LOT OF ATTENTION ON NOW I UNDERSTAND IT'S GONNA BE A NEW ABILITY TO FINE OWNERS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY YOU'RE HOPING IF THAT'S ALSO GOING TO BE IN A MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE. THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY. AGAIN THE IT IN PARTICULAR THE DAMS THAT THEY HAVE IN ORDER SO THEY CAN MEET SAFE USED. YEAH AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'LL WORK MOST EFFECTIVELY WITH THE OWNERS WHO ARE NON COMPLIANT. THE ONES THAT AREN'T ABLE TO DO IT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE. THE RESOURCES. IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE IS THAT REALLY GOING TO BE. TOUGH BYNUM AND THAT'S WHERE THE RESERVOIR RESTRICTIONS COME AND IT'S MORE THE PHYSICAL STUFF THAT WE CAN DO AND RISK MITIGATION MEASURES THEN FINDING SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO GO FIX THE DAMS TIME. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING HOW LONG ARE YOU DOING THE THE LEVEL RESTRICTIONS. WHEN YOU WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEBODY RESTRICTION HOW LONG IT IS A LOT DOESN'T LAST IN OUR CLASSROOMS HILLARY'S FIXED. IT YEAH AND SOMETIMES. AND SOMETIMES AS WE GET NEW INFORMATION AND WE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS SO IF SOMETHING'S FIRST FOUND TO BE SEISMICALLY DEFICIENT IT STARTS WITH THE RESTRICTION AND AS WE GO THROUGH IT. AND IF WE FIND OUT AS MORE DATA COMES AND IT'S IT'S WORSE. THAN WE THOUGHT THEN THEY'RE STRETCHING GOES DOWN LOWER. YOU KNOW THE. NATIONAL WATER DOES. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER JENNER DOES. WELL WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE. LIKE SUPPOSE HAMMER WOULD BE OVER THESE. PRIVATE. THEY HELD DAMS OR. SOME KIND OF A DISTRICT. HELP THEM. BUT WHO IS SHE HAD FOR SURE FOR THE DEPARTMENT. IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE BUDGET I KNOW FOR CAST SOME OF THE ALREADY. BUT THAT'S AN IRREGULAR AUTHORITY. WHAT WHAT SEVENTY? WHAT WHAT SECURE YOU KNOW THE? THAT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES DOES WHAT IT SAID THE DO AND NEEDS TO DO. DOES THE REGULATOR. IDEAS IDEAS THE REGULATOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT WHEN IT COMES TO DO ABSOLUTELY WHO IS. THE AUTHORITY TO BE A SAFE ADAPT SO IT'S THAT SITUATION WHERE BUT I CAN THEY FIND THE DEPARTMENT OR SANCTION THE DEPARTMENT ANYWAY WHATEVER THEY WANT AS A REGULATOR. AFTER GOING THROUGH THAT TERMS OF DEVELOPING REGULATIONS BUT. WE TREAT. THE DEPARTMENT JUST LIKE WE TREAT THE FARMER AND AND SO THE SAME RULES WILL APPLY. SO YOU CAN A FORCES SECTION YOU CAN GO TO COURT TO. AND WILL. YEAH WE'RE WORKING WHAT THAT'LL BE IN OUR A REGULATIONS BUT JUST FOR A QUICK EXAMPLE PARRIS DAM THE WHEN THE SUN HERE WHEN THAT THE SEISMIC DEFICIENCY WAS FOUND. WE ORDERED A TWENTY FOOT RESTRICTION ON THE ROWS OF WAR. OKAY AND JUST LET ME SAY IF WE EVER GET TO A SITUATION WHERE. THE ASSEMBLY IS HAVING TO FIND THAT APARTMENT FOR SOMETHING AND WE HAVE A TOTAL BREAKDOWN WERE NOT ALLOW IT TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE WILL STAY COMMUNICATIONS SO YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THAT REGULATOR IS PART OF. THE YOU KNOW THE THE SAME DEPARTMENT I DON'T FACILITY. pRIGHT AND SO THIS WILL ALLOW US TO TO MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION AT WORK MIDDLE CLOSELY WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE WITHIN THE REGULATORY BOUNDARIES. WELL THAT'S ONE THING THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO SEE YOU KNOW. THE PUBLIC LOOKS AT IT AND SAY SEE YOU CAN REALLY. HAMMER ON THEM. AND IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY AND A VERY HEAVY HANDED WAY THAT I'M. BEEN DEALING WITH IT WITH ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ALL THE TIME THE AGENCY BY AGENCY. SOME A LITTLE BIT WORSE IN OTHER LIKE FISH AND WILDLIFE. BUT THAT SAID THEN THEY LOOK AT HERE'S A MONUMENTAL FAILURE. AND AT ENDEMIC FAILURE OVER DECADES. AND SO WHAT THE CONSEQUENCE. AND WHAT DID ANYBODY GET FIRED DID DID ANYBODY GET. DISCIPLINED OR. DEMOTED OR. DID THE AGENCY SUFFER ANY. ANY CONSEQUENCE. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOME PUBLIC ANGER AND LEGISLATIVE ANGERED YOU'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH PLOT OF THAT. BUT. YEAH WE OF THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT WHY THE OVERSIGHT AS WE DISCUSSED JUST OVER IMPORTANT. AND SUFFICE TO SAY IT'S GOT TO BE BETTER THAN IT HAS BEEN. THANK. IT'S FROM ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND IT OULD MAYBE JUST RESPOND I THINK DOES A GOOD POINT I MEAN. YEAH AND I'VE BY THINK IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A COUPLE TIMES BUT WHAT HAS HAS THERE BEEN CHANGES THAT THE DEPARTMENT. HILL FROM ACCOUNTABILITY STANDPOINT OFSAY SEEN THAT HEY THESE THERE WERE SOME SERIOUS DEFICIENCIES HERE. DID YOU GUYS MAKE. INTERNAL CHANGES ACCORDINGLY I MEAN I'M TAKE US WHERE THEIR FIRINGS WERE THEIR REASSIGNMENTS WHERE THERE CHANGES. A YOU KNOW. THE TERMS OF OF OF STRUCTURE AS A RESULT OF OF THIS. SO THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES STRUCTURALLY. AYE. CAN'T COMMENT ON PERSONAL TYPE ACTIONS IF THEY'RE MORE THE ADVERSE NATURE. I'M BUT I WILL SAY SO SOME EXAMPLES OF THAT OUR. THE. BRINGING TECH CRADDICK INTO THIS NEW POSITION EXECUTIVE LEVEL POINT PERSON FOR OR A FILMY WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAS TO BE ONE. PERSON THAT EVERYONE KNOWS IS THAT PERSON INFORMATION GOES THROUGH HIM INFORMATION COMES BACK. THROUGH HIM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE INTERNAL TYPE CHANGES WE'VE MADE. OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MAYBE NOT I'D FROM AN ORGANIZATIONAL STANDPOINT BUT. INCORPORATION OF YEAR WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE TWENTY FOUR POTENTIAL FAILURE MECHANISMS THAT THE FORENSIC TEAM IDENTIFIED EARLY ON. WE ADDRESS THOSE IN THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAIN SPILLWAY SO. THAT WAS AN IMMEDIATE CHANGE. WE TALKED ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT I RECOGNIZE IT'S VERY SPECIFIC AND AND MORE HAVE YOUNG CONSTRUCTION IN INCOME AND CONSTRUCTION HANCE MINTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE. M.. ERIC AYE I WILL JUST POINT OUT IS ARE THE. NEWEST DEPUTY DIRECTOR WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO. LOOK AT. RESTRUCTURING REFOCUSING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY ON ELEMENTS LIKE FLOOD MANAGEMENT IN GENERAL WHICH IS UNDER ERIC'S PURVIEW I KNOW DS SO DE THERE IS ALWAYS A FIREWALL BUT THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN. BUT I THINK JUST IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATIONS REPORTING WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW. HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY TO KIND OF HAVE SOME TRANSPARENCY IF YOU WILL I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THEM? THEMES WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST. NO SINCE LAST FEBRUARY IS IS HOW CAN THE DEPARTMENT BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN CHANGES WERE MAKING. SO NOT WANT. WE'RE NOT DONE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO COME I THINK IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FRIENDS EIGHTEEN REPORT WILL BE AND NEXT BIG STEP FOR US. WE HAVE SOME STRIKE TEAMS WE PUT TOGETHER INTERNALLY TO DEAL WITH DIFFERENT SPECIFIC ELEMENTS AROUND THE OROVILLE. FACILITY WHETHER IT'S THE SPILLWAY WHETHER AT SOME OF THE RECREATIONAL. EARLY IMPLEMENTATION ACTION SO WERE WERE FOR IDENTIFYING PEOPLE IN PULLING THOSE TEAMS TOGETHER TO MOVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND QUICKLY ON SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS. AND THERE MIGHT BE MORE BUT I WAS OF THE ONES THAT. ARE POPPING UP IN MY HEAD RIGHT AT THE MOMENT. THINK YOU'RE A MUCH. AND THINK TO THIS PANEL IT'S ALSO BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE AND WE APPRECIATE IT. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO PEOPLE ONE OF HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ONE LINE UP ON THE SIDE OVER HERE AND THEN TAKE NOT MORE THAN TWO MINUTES TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. RON STRUCK FRANCE OF THE RIVER. WE WERE ONE OF THE OUTSIDE GROUPS THAT I RAISE THE. ISSUE OF. OF THEM. G. LOGICAL TO POLLUTE STABILITY OF THE WHOLE SIDE. CLEARLY THIS THIS HAD BEEN A VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING. BOTH A MACHETE YOU AS WELL AS TO MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE. IT ALSO I THINK HIGHLIGHTS THE INCREDIBLE. TRUST THAT WE HAVE TO PLACE. OR THAT WE WE. WE'RE WE'RE FORCED PLACE IN THAT APARTMENT AND THE DAM SAFETY REGULATORS. BUT EXAMPLE. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD. THE CONCERNED. IN DURING THE INCIDENT THAT IF THERE WAS A FAILURE OF THE. ELECTRICAL POWER STANDARD ELECTRICAL POWER TO THE. US OF FLOOD CONTROL ADVOCATES. THAT IT WILL TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO SOME ANOTHER GET BACK CONTROL OF THE KATE'S. THE. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS MANUAL CLEARLY STATES FOR OROVILLE CLEARLY STATES THAT THERE'S. BACKUP POWER INDEPENDENT POWER. AT THE DAM THAT IS FULLY CAPABLE OF OPERATING THE GATES. I SO I ASSUME THAT WAS IN INDEED IN PLACE I'M SURPRISED HERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE. OR PERHAPS IT WAS A MISSTATEMENT BUT THE THE ISSUE. FOR THE COMMITTEE AND FOR US. AND FOR THE DEPARTMENT IS. THAT THAT'S CRITICAL ENERGY. INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION THAT'S REALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC THE DEPARTMENT PROBABLY WOULDN'T FEEL. THAT HE COULD DISCUSS. ANY DEFICIENCIES THAT IT MIGHT HAVE IN EMPOWER INDEPENDENT POWER RELIABLE POWER TO THE FLOOD CONTROL OUTLETS. AND SO. AND WE WE IN EFFECT HAVE TO TRUST THE DEPARTMENT. AND. THE FEDERAL REGULATORS. THAT. THAT INDEED IS NOT A PROBLEM. AND WE ALSO HEAR THAT WEALTH OF THE EMPHASIS HAS BEEN ON. A DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT FAIL THE DAM. NOT HAVING POWER TO THE FLOOD CONTROL OUTLETS IS A VERY SERIOUS DEFICIENCY. AND LET IT VERY WELL MAY NOT FEEL THE DAM. LEAST IF THE EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. DOESN'T FAIL. SO. SO I DON'T KNOW IF I'M FULLY CONFIDENT OR THE DEPARTMENTS FULLY CONFIDENT WHERE YOU AND YOUR OVERSIGHT ROLE. IS FULLY CONFIDENT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT AND THE REGULATORS REALLY HAFTA. FIRM HAND ON THIS. THE. THE SECOND POINT I WOULD JUST RAISE. WHICH IS A POINT I ALWAYS RAISE. IS. IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING. ON EMERGENCY SPILLWAY THAT WON'T THROW LARGE QUANTITIES OF. A HILLSIDE INTO THE CANYON BELOW. BUT AT LEAST AT THIS POINT I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NO PLANS TO DO THAT. SO SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES THAT YOU SAW SOME OF THE CHAOS. THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH. THE. INCIDENT HAS YET TO BE. FULLY ADDRESSED AND. AND I HOPE THE DEPARTMENT DOES AND HOPE THE REGULATORS. ADDRESS THAT. BUT. FOR AS AN OUTSIDE GROUP OR JUST AS A MEMBER OF THE INTERESTED PUBLIC IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO ENGAGE. WE'VE HAD FOR. FORMAL COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION SINCE THE INCIDENT. AND THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE CHARGED WITH MAKING SURE THAT THE FACILITIES ARE ADEQUATE TO HIS. YOU KNOW OF SUSTAIN THE FUNCTIONS THE MISSION OF THE PROJECT. AND WE'VE YET TO HEAR ANYTHING BACK FROM THE COMMISSION. SO. I HAVE WARY NOW. QUIT. YOUR ROLE AS A AS A AS A. LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. MANDY BE ERY IMPORTANT SOME OF THESE ISSUES. AND. IT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SUCCESSFULLY AND IN A WAY THAT INVOLVES. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SO THAT WE CAN TRUST THAT. ON THE DEPARTMENT OF THE REGULATORS ARE DOING THEIR JOB. SO THAT'S KIND OF MY MY REMARKS FOR THINK IT'S PREMATURE THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON. CUPID TWO MINUTES YOU CAN. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE GROUP THANKS IDW ALL FOR THE GREAT WORK THEY'VE DONE ON THE SPILLWAY TO THIS PORT. JOHN FRANK SENIOR TEAM FOR NOT STANDING REPORT. SHOULD BE VERY HELPFUL IN US GOING FORWARD. CONSERVATIVES AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF JUST I'M SORRY. BUT I'M THAT MEN TAKE ON ME. FOR TIME EVACUEE. AND RESIDENT OF YUBA CITY. AND EIGHTY SIX A MY FATHER'S CELL NUMBER MAIL. AND I WAS INUNDATED THREE TO FOUR FEET OF WATER IN WHICH PUT ME OUT OF BUSINESS FOR SIX MONTHS SANTA DOZENS OF FAMILIES WITHOUT INCOME FOR THAT LENGTH OF TIME AS THE MACHINE RISK COMPLETE STRIPPED DOWN. PERRANCE MOTORS REPLACED I FELT THE PAIN OF MISMANAGEMENT FOR DECADES NOW. AND I I THINK IT'S NOT WATER AS MUCH IT IS HUMAN DECISIONS AND I THINK REPORT JOHN. AND THAT OF YOUR TEAM CLEARLY POINTED OUT. THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE TIMES IN WHICH GOOD OVERSIGHT IN REGULATION HAPPENS THAT IS IN THE FIFTY YEAR RELICENSING OF THE DAM. AND IN THE FIFTY YEAR WATER CONTRACTS THAT HAS NOT BEEN MENTIONED IN THIS. BRIEF HISTORY ON THE WATER CONTRACTS. WHEN THE OROVILLE DAM WAS BUILT IT WAS PART OF ONE OF MANY PROJECTS THE OTHER ONE BE IN THE NORTH COAST RIVERS. WHICH WAS TO PROMISE AN ADDITIONAL WATER THAT WAS NEVER BUILT. SO THAT THE WATER THAT WATER CONTRACTORS GOT FOUR POINT MILLION ACRE FEET WITH THE CALL TABLE A WATER NEVER MATERIALIZE IT CAME TO POINT FOR ANNUAL DELIVERIES. THOSE. TABLE A WATERS HAVE BEEN USES TRADING CARDS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES NAMELY IN THE MONTEREY AGREEMENT WITH THE KERN COUNTY WATER BANK. IN WHICH THEY FORFEITED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF RESOURCES IN THEIR INVESTMENT NO WATER BANK. RELEASED A TO PRIVATE HANDS IN EXCHANGE OF RETIRING TABLE A WATER. THIS TABLE EIGHT WATERS BEEN USES LEVERAGE FOR WATER DELIVERIES A PRIORITY OF. WATER AND POWER FIRST OVER DAM SAFETY. ANOTHER INCIDENTS IN REGARDS TO THAT WAS MARISCHAL DAM WAS NEVER BUILT. ON THE YUBA RIVER WHERE THE FEATHER IN THE U. BECOMES TOGETHER BEFORE THE FEATHER JOINS THE SACKING HAD SACRAMENTO'S WAY. THAT WAS TO PROVIDE ANOTHER HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF FLOOD PROTECTION. WHEN THAT DAM WAS NEVER BUILT FOR KONAMI WENT BACK TO DO W. R. AND SAID THAT YOU NEED TO PROVIDE ANOTHER HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. THAT SCHEME THAT THEY CAME UP WITH. PROVIDE THAT HUNDRED HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER. WAS TO ALLOW WHAT THEY CALL SURCHARGE FLOWS TO GO OVER THE TOP OF EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. BURIED IN ALL THAT DATA THAT WE COULDN'T FIND ALONG WITH. BORE HOLE DRILLING WAS THEIR OWN OPERATIONAL MANUAL THAT REQUIRED THEM TO LOOK RELEASED TEN TO TWELVE FEET. OF WATER OVER THE TOP EMERGENCY SPILLWAY. WHICH EVERYBODY SAYS THEY NEVER WANTED TO USE. THEIR OWN OPERATION MANUAL WAS COMPROMISE IN DOING SO THEY COMPROMISED. TWENTY PERCENT OF THE FLOOD STORAGE SPACE ON THAT RIVER. TWENTY PERCENT WOULD HAVE KEPT THE WATER FROM REACHING THE TOP THE LEVEES BACK IN EIGHTY SIX AND NINETY SEVEN. WE WOULD HAVE HAD THAT THE LEVEE SLUMPING WE WOULD HAVE HAD. THE STATE PAYING OUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES IN NINETY SEVEN. BECAUSE THEY COMPROMISED FLOOD PROTECTION FOR THE SAKE OF WATER DELIVERIES. I FIND IT. IRONIC THAT AT THIS MOMENT THAT YOUR BILL DAM HAPPEN BOTH THOSE SETS OF REGULATIONS ARE BEFORE US TODAY. THE RELICENSING WITH FOR FOR ANOTHER FIFTY YEARS. AND. THE FIFTY YEAR WATER CONTRACTS WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS. HIDDEN IN THAT IS. NOT ONLY DO THEY WANT TO MAINTAIN A FOUR POINT TWO MILLION ACRE FEET OF TABLE A WATER THAT IS UNDELIVERABLE. BUT THEY ALSO WANT TO SET UP FINANCIAL COMMITTEE. THAT GIVES STATE WATER CONTRACTORS NDW R. EQUAL REPRESENTATION ON ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON HOW MONEY IN BUDGETING SHOULD BE DONE. AND NO WHERE IN THAT. CLAUSE FOUR FOUR POINT FOUR POINT FOUR FOUR WITHIN STATE WATER CONTRACT. IF I'M NOT IMPACT REPORT THERE'S GOING TO BE COMING OUT SHORTLY. IS THERE ANY PUBLIC RECORD CETACEAN ANY PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY OF THE BUDGETING THAT GOES TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY THAT THEY SAY IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. I THINK THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD DO TWO THINGS. I THINK YOU SHOULD PUT TOGETHER A LETTER JUST LIKE A LOT OF THE LOCAL COALITIONS HAVE. YOUR REQUEST FOR TO HOLD OFF ON THE RELICENSING OF OROVILLE DAM. INTEL THESE ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY JOHNS GREAT TEAM ARE DRESSED TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL THE. MEMBERS THAT HAVE TO LIVE DOWNSTREAM OF THAT DAMN. THE SECOND THING THAT THIS COMMITTEE OUGHT TO DO. IS TAKE A HARD LOOK AT THE RELICENSING UP WITH THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS IN TAKE OUT THOSE CLAWS THAT ARE SELF SERVING. AND PUT PUBLIC SAFETY FIRST WITHIN THE STATE WATER CONTRACTED YOU RELY SINCE IT'S WELL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. OKAY AND IN NO. FROM AND CREATE MANNERS ALRIGHT OF THIS CONCLUDES THE HEARING AGAIN I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR THEIR TIME THEIR EXPERTISE HOME. AND AGAIN WE WE TO CENTERS NIELSEN AND MISTER GALLAGHER. AGAIN WE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT WAS A VERY TRYING TIME FOR YOUR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND. IF WE WERE ALL GONNA DO BETTER GOING FORWARD WE WILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH
