00:09:25.498 --> 00:09:26.732
OF THE NOTION OF RESOURCE

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:29.235

THE FEDERAL -- I AGREE THIS IS A

00:42:04.321 --> 00:42:05.723
FEDERAL ISSUE.

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:06.991
IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE STATE

00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:08.325
FROM DOING THIS WE'VE WE'VE

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.408
FOLLOWS I THINK.

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.543
THIS BILL WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT

00:42:26.610 --> 00:42:28.879
BILL TO TO PASS HERE LOCALLY TO

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.014
GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.482
THE SAME THING NATION WIDE.

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:32.883
WE COULD SHOW THAT LEADERSHIP

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.318
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.152
BUT CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:36.720
GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY MADE

00:42:36.787 --> 00:42:38.656
COMMENTS TO THE INDUSTRY SAYING

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.657

IN IN IN ESTABLISHING.

00:42:51.468 --> 00:42:52.937
A IT'S MORE OF A THREAT THAN A

00:42:53.003 --> 00:42:54.605
REAL ATTEMPT TO SOLVE THIS

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:56.473

THINKS EFFECTS OUT WAY.

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.076
AND THEN THERE WAS A CONCERN

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.878
ABOUT LIABILITY EXPOSURE SAY A

00:43:00.945 --> 00:43:04.515
REVERSE NINE ONE ONE IS BLOCKED.

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:06.383

WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.090
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ARE NOT THE

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.725
ORIGIN OF THESE CALLS AND WE

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.059
DON'T WANT TO TREAT THEM.

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:52.363
LIKE LIKE -- CRIMINALS AND

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:54.331
THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS LAW DOES IT

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:57.067

CENTER STERN DID YOU HAVE A

00:45:53.117 --> 00:45:54.852
QUESTION YEAH.

00:45:54.918 --> 00:45:58.355
JUST VERY BRIEFLY -- BUILDING

00:45:58.422 --> 00:46:02.259
OFF THAT THAT QUESTION THOUGH --

THEY DON'T PUT A POINT IT IT'S

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:09.700
NOT ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THE

00:46:09.766 --> 00:46:11.835
PLAN ITSELF IN TERMS OF THEM

00:46:11.902 --> 00:46:13.804
THESE PLANS BEING.

00:46:13.871 --> 00:46:15.973
GOING TO IF FIXING EVERYTHING IS

00:46:16.039 --> 00:46:16.773
THAT THEY'VE GOT TO PUT

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.542

DO THAT IT'S VERY SIMPLE I MEAN

00:46:24.448 --> 00:46:26.650
THE THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS.

00:46:26.717 --> 00:46:28.185
WE KNOW WHAT THE A TECHNOLOGY

00:46:28.252 --> 00:46:29.019
DOES.

00:46:29.086 --> 00:46:30.654
AS LONG AS THEY PROVIDE A

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.890
TECHNOLOGY THAT EFFECTIVELY DOES

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.658
WHAT WERE WERE ASKING THEM TO DO

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:36.126
THE AUTHENTICATOR CALL.

YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.068
EXTENDING TIME WE TALK ABOUT

00:46:45.135 --> 00:46:46.803
ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS THIS IS NOT

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.740
ONEROUS IT DOESN'T IT IT'S NOT A

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.241
COMPLICATED THING THAT.

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.844
WE CAN ONLY.

00:46:53.911 --> 00:46:56.246
ARE ASKED THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.015
COMPANIES TO EMPLOY TECHNOLOGY

00:46:58.081 --> 00:46:59.950
THAT EXISTS TODAY THIS IS NOT

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:02.152
SOME SCI FI -- YOU KNOW A

00:47:02.219 --> 00:47:04.288
FUTURISTIC TECHNOLOGY THE STILL

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.522
HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED.

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:08.025
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE SIMPLICITY

00:47:08.091 --> 00:47:08.992
OF THIS BILL WE'RE WE'RE ASKING

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:10.394
THEM DEPLOYED THE TECHNOLOGY

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.895
EXISTS TODAY CAN THOSE

00:47:11.962 --> 00:47:13.397
TECHNOLOGIES BE IMPROVED IN THE

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.799
FUTURE YES AND IF IS AS OUR

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:16.300
IMPROVED.

00:47:16.366 --> 00:47:18.302
I THINK THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME

00:47:18.368 --> 00:47:20.571
SOME LEVEL OF AN AGENCY TO SAY

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:21.071
YOU KNOW WORK YOU'RE NOT

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:22.472

THE THE THE BEST AND THE MOST.

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:27.477
EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGIES OF OUR

00:47:27.544 --> 00:47:29.112
TIMEYOU'RE STILL IN.

00:47:29.179 --> 00:47:30.681
IN A FEW DECADES BEHIND THAT WE

00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:32.015
NEED SOMEBODY.

00:47:32.082 --> 00:47:34.284
TO THIS IS GONNA BE A PROBLEM

00:47:34.351 --> 00:47:35.252
THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE IN

00:47:35.319 --> 00:47:37.921
FUTURE YEARS AS PEOPLE.

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.256
YOU KNOW VOTE.

00:47:39.323 --> 00:47:40.490
I REMEMBER WHEN THEY CAME UP

00:47:40.557 --> 00:47:42.326
WITH THE VIRUS VIRUS ANTI VIRUS

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:43.560
SOFTWARE.

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:44.995
WE WE THOUGHT VIRUSES WERE WERE

00:47:45.062 --> 00:47:47.064
SOLVE WE'RE STILL.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.633
THAT'S JUST IN OF ALL THE IN --

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.768
INDUSTRY INVOLVED IN HUMAN

00:47:51.835 --> 00:47:52.836
PRACTICE.

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:57.407
THAT NEEDS AN EVOLUTION OF OF A

00:47:57.474 --> 00:48:02.346
OF A COUNTER -- THIS IS WHAT'S

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:03.213
GOING TO BE SIMILAR HERE BUT WE

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.582
NEED TO CREATE THAT STRUCTURE

00:48:05.649 --> 00:48:07.484
AND THE MECHANISM TO ENSURE.

00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.852
THAT AT LEAST WERE FIGHTING BACK

00:48:08.919 --> 00:48:10.887
SO EVEN THOUGH IT MAY NOT BE

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:13.657
PERFECT THE FIRST CUT THIS BILL

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:15.025
WOULDN'T NECESSARILY.

00:48:15.092 --> 00:48:17.060
ENHANCE LIABILITY JUST BECAUSE

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.495
THAT PLANS NOT PERFECT ENOUGH

00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.297
FIXING THE WHOLE PROBLEM THAT'S

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:21.098

SHOT AT IT PUT SOMETHING FORWARD.

00:48:25.335 --> 00:48:27.604
AND THEN LET THIS EVOLVE OVER

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:29.539
TIME BECAUSE I I MEAN THE THING

00:48:29.606 --> 00:48:31.408
THAT SCARES ME IS LESS I THINK

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:32.442
THE TELCOS.

00:48:32.509 --> 00:48:34.378
RIGHT IN CABLE AND EVERYBODY'S

00:48:34.444 --> 00:48:35.846
THEY HATE THIS PROBABLY AS MUCH

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:37.114
AS WE DO BECAUSE IT MAKES US

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:39.549
HATE OUR PHONES AND HOW HE NOW

00:48:39.616 --> 00:48:42.552
AND WE WE BLAME THEM -- BUT THE

00:48:42.619 --> 00:48:43.854
THE THE PART THAT CONCERNS ME

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.489
THE MOST IS THE A. I..

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:47.791
AND THAT YOU KNOW THE ROBOTS OUT

00:48:47.858 --> 00:48:48.492
THERE WITHOUT ANY.

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:50.460
I DON'T I KNOW THAT'S BEYOND THE

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.329
SCOPE OF THIS BILL BUT I DON'T

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.964
KNOW WHAT MAYBE STAFF HAS SOME

00:48:54.031 --> 00:48:55.499
IDEA BUT LIKE DO WE ACTUALLY

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:56.800

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:58.168
PEOPLE WHO WERE.

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:00.103
EMPLOYING THIS A AYE TECHNOLOGY

YOU YOU COULD MAKE.

00:49:25.595 --> 00:49:26.997
MILLIONS OF CALLS THROUGH THIS

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.165
APP FOR FREE.

00:49:28.231 --> 00:49:29.866

AND THEIR MARKETING AT I MEAN

00:49:35.572 --> 00:49:37.507
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOME ELEMENT

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:40.544
OF OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE THIS A

00:49:40.610 --> 00:49:43.580
CRIMINAL OFFENSE -- JOHN OLIVER

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.048
DID THIS AMAZING PIECE.

00:49:45.115 --> 00:49:46.950

00:50:11.775 --> 00:50:13.677
COUNTRY WE'RE NOT DOING.

ARE NO CONSEQUENCES WELL THAT

00:50:24.388 --> 00:50:27.090
JUST BASICALLY EXPLAINS THE

00:50:27.157 --> 00:50:29.259
STATE OF AFFAIRS IN OUR COUNTRY.

I THINK I DIALED THE SAID I'M TO

00:50:39.069 --> 00:50:39.936
SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT I'VE

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:41.905
JUST UNCLEAR.

00:50:41.972 --> 00:50:43.373
IF THE TECHNOLOGY.

OF THIS BILL -- CANNOT ASCERTAIN

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:52.816
THE POSITIVE FROM THE NEGATIVE.

00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.785
TYPE OF ROBO CALLS.

00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:56.520
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S

00:50:56.586 --> 00:50:57.821
ALWAYS SOMEBODY OUT THERE THAT

00:50:57.888 --> 00:51:00.557
CAN SUIT ANY TIME ANY PLACE.

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:02.893
YEAH OF GIVEN THE TOURNEY EGO SU

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:03.994
AND SO.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.429
MY CONCERN FROM FROM WHAT I

00:51:05.495 --> 00:51:08.198
HEARD FROM THE TESTIMONY IS.

00:51:08.265 --> 00:51:09.933
AND THAT THAT THAT THAT COULD BE

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.835
A PROBLEM SO I'M HOPING THAT

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.170
YOU'LL WORK WITH THE YEAH THE

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.738
OPPOSITION ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE

00:51:14.805 --> 00:51:16.139
I DON'T WANT TO CREATE

00:51:16.206 --> 00:51:17.741
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:19.342
TRY TO DO THE BEST THING THAT WE

00:51:19.409 --> 00:51:20.944
CAN FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:23.513
YOU YOUR YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.549
EVEN WITHOUT THIS LAW ANYBODY

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:26.883
COULD FILE A LAWSUIT TO THE

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:29.953
TELECOMMUNICATIONS CURRENTLY FOR

00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.321
FOR THE RUBLE COLLEGE ANYBODY.

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:33.223
THIS BILL THAT WON'T CHANGE THAT

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.424
THIS BILL DOESN'T HAVE A PRIVATE

00:51:34.491 --> 00:51:35.892
RIGHT OF ACTION ASSOCIATED WITH

00:51:35.959 --> 00:51:38.495
THAT SO -- THE FACT THAT THIS

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.030
BILL PASSED DOESN'T CHANGE.

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:42.199
THAT'S IN OUR YOUR DISSIDENT

00:51:42.265 --> 00:51:43.733
PANTS AT ALL.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.534
I I GET THAT BUT IT'S IT'S SO

00:51:44.601 --> 00:51:46.036
IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A LAWSUIT

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:48.638
ON I I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THESE.

00:51:48.705 --> 00:51:50.941
ROBO CALLS AND THE DEFENSE IS WE

00:51:51.007 --> 00:51:52.609
DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:53.743
FENCES.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:55.278
BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING THAT

00:51:55.345 --> 00:51:57.080
MIGHT GET THE ATTENTION OF A

00:51:57.147 --> 00:52:00.884
JUDGE OR YES SOMEBODY WERE.

00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:02.586
YOU KNOW WE HAD.

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:06.056
A YELLOW PARENTS AT THE SCHOOL.

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.791
THE THEY DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE

00:52:07.858 --> 00:52:10.460
AND WE WERE DAMAGE BECAUSE X. Y.

00:52:10.527 --> 00:52:12.162
AND SEE AND SO THAT PROBABLY

00:52:12.229 --> 00:52:13.964
RISES TO A HIGHER LEVEL ON ABOUT

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.764
EDGES.

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:16.867
RADAR THEN THAT WOULD BE A LOSS

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.201
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CONCENTRATED

00:52:18.268 --> 00:52:19.669
ON WHETHER THE TELECOMMUNICATION

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:22.372
HAS EFFECTUATE OR EMPLOYED OR

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:24.407
PUT INTO PRACTICE OF CALL AYE

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:25.909
AUTHENTICATION PROGRAM.

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:27.377
SO THAT WOULD BE.

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:29.546
THE THAT WHAT THE ONLY THING

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:32.082
THAT WOULD GIVE SOMEBODY.

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:32.649
REASON TO LAWSUIT UNDER THIS

00:52:32.716 --> 00:52:33.383
BILL.

THESE PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY REALLY

00:53:32.976 --> 00:53:34.244
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FOLKS.

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:35.845
THE QUESTION I AM FOCUSED WITH

00:53:35.912 --> 00:53:37.747

GENERATED AROUND THE WORLD

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.756

ACTUALLY FROM A TECHNOLOGICAL

00:54:54.057 --> 00:54:55.258
STANDPOINT.

ALWAYS WAS FIXING THIS.

00:55:12.742 --> 00:55:13.710
AGAIN -- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:14.678
WOULD BE EMPLOYED AS A VOICE OF

00:55:14.744 --> 00:55:17.414
THE A CALLER AUTHENTICATION SO

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.483
EVEN ACTION -- IF I CAN DESCRIBE

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:23.186
IT IN A WAY THAT MOST PEOPLE.

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:25.121
COULD UNDERSTAND IS THAT -- WHEN

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:27.590
WHENEVER YOU GO INTO A COMPUTER?

00:55:27.657 --> 00:55:30.160
AND THEY THEY HAVE THEY ASK YOU

00:55:30.226 --> 00:55:32.696
TO TRANSLATE A WORD.

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:34.497
THAT HAS BEEN THAT IT'S KIND OF

00:55:34.564 --> 00:55:36.366
A SQUIGGLY WORD AND IT'S NOT

00:55:36.433 --> 00:55:37.867
SEEN IT YEAH YEAH AND THEY SAY

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:39.436
WHAT IS TO SAY AND THEN TO YOU

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:40.970
ENTER WHAT YOU READ RIGHT

00:55:41.037 --> 00:55:42.605
NORMALLY THAT'S A WAY AROUND A

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.207
COMPUTER THAT CAN.

00:55:44.274 --> 00:55:46.009
THAT CAN ã RESPOND OR FILL IN

00:55:46.076 --> 00:55:47.010
THE BLANK.

00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:50.547
BUT A COMPUTER CAN'T REALLY -- I

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:51.915
IDENTIFY.

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.517
CURSIVE RIGHT UP LET IS NOT EVEN

00:55:54.584 --> 00:55:56.252
CURSIVE IT'S KIND OF IN A IN A

00:55:56.319 --> 00:55:58.655
IN AN AUDITORY SKATED AWAY THAT

00:55:58.722 --> 00:55:59.689
THAT YOUR I CAN PICK IT UP AT

00:55:59.756 --> 00:56:00.824
THE COMPUTER HERE I CAN PICK IT

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:02.325
UP AND YOU CAN KINDA LOOK AND SO

00:56:02.392 --> 00:56:03.526
THAT KINDA LOOKS LIKE TO BE A

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:03.827
KIND.

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:06.763
OF THE FACT HE LOOKS KINDA LOOKS

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:08.164
LIKE AN NINE I'M.

00:56:08.231 --> 00:56:10.100
AND THEN YOU ENTER THAT WHAT IS

00:56:10.166 --> 00:56:16.506
BE AND STILL [inaudible]

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.174
AND SO [inaudible]

00:56:18.241 --> 00:56:20.643
GREAT RIDES.

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.680
IF I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THAT.

00:56:23.747 --> 00:56:26.116
OUR SENATOR ALAN SO IT IN A

00:56:26.182 --> 00:56:28.818
PLACE A SIMILAR TYPE OF APPROACH

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:30.120
TO IDENTIFYING.

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:31.554
A CALL WHEN IT'S COMING IN AND

00:56:31.621 --> 00:56:35.325
AND AND IF IF IT IT'S ACTUALLY

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:39.162
COMING INTO Q. COMPUTER PROGRAM --

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:42.031
THERE'S LIKE AN ADDITIONAL STEP.

00:56:42.098 --> 00:56:44.400
FOLLOW TO ACTUALLY ENTER INTO

00:56:44.467 --> 00:56:46.169
THE THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:48.705
SYSTEM IT'S A WHOLE SET OF IT'S

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.306
A WHOLE PROGRAM.

00:56:50.373 --> 00:56:51.875
REGULATED ACTUALLY BY THE F. THE

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:52.976
FCC.

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.344
A PROGRAM CALLED CHICKEN AND

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.080
STIRS IT'S NOT ACTUALLY SPELL

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:59.215
CHECK AND STIRS BUT IT'S AN

00:56:59.282 --> 00:56:59.449
ACRONYM.

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.884
THAT THAT.

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.819
THAT IS A SHAKEN AND STIRRED

00:57:02.886 --> 00:57:04.988
JUST BASICALLY EMPLOYING SHAKEN

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:07.123
AND STIRS MAKING IT UP.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:08.925
A CODED SAY.

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.727
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO OF EMPLOYEE

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:12.562
SHAKEN ANSWERS INSTEAD OF

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:15.131
CALIFORNIA TO AUTHENTICATE CALLS.

00:57:15.198 --> 00:57:16.599
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT NOW I DON'T

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:18.501
UNDERSTAND WHAT Y. FCC HASN'T

00:57:18.568 --> 00:57:20.170
MADE A REAL NATIONWIDE AS I

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:22.071
MENTIONED CAñADA BY THE END OF

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:22.939
THIS MONTH?

00:57:23.006 --> 00:57:24.808
WILL BE EMPLOYING -- THAT

00:57:24.874 --> 00:57:27.477
TECHNOLOGY TO TO CUT OUT ALL

00:57:27.544 --> 00:57:29.779
THOSE TROUBLE CALLS FROM THERE.

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:32.081
TELEPHONE NETWORK I THINK WE CAN

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:32.982
DO THIS.

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.284
THEY CAN DO IT IN A MONTH I

00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:36.386
THINK WE CAN DO IT IN A YEAR AND

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:39.322
A HALF AND AND IT'S IT'S

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:42.058
POSSIBLE NOW AGAIN.

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.593
THERE ARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT.

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:45.929
I'M WE'RE DEALING MAINLY WITH

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:47.831
THE THE ROBO CALLS THE COMPUTER

00:57:47.897 --> 00:57:49.532
GENERATED TO WHAT THE POTS THAT

00:57:49.599 --> 00:57:51.601
YOU THAT YOU ARE SO FAMILIAR

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:52.368
WITH IN THE BILL THAT YOU RAN

00:57:52.435 --> 00:57:53.803
LAST YEAR YEAH.

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.205
WE'RE WITH THAT'S WHAT WE ARE

00:57:55.271 --> 00:57:57.640
FOCUSING ON WITH THIS BILL THERE

00:57:57.707 --> 00:57:59.375
ARE OTHER ROBO CALLERS THAT ARE

00:57:59.442 --> 00:58:01.845
ACTUAL TELEMARKETERS THERE ARE.

00:58:01.911 --> 00:58:03.880
YOU KNOW.

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:05.081
PROGRAMS THAT.

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:07.417
THAT CAN BE TRACED. TO AN ORIGIN

00:58:07.483 --> 00:58:09.853
CALLER THAT.

00:58:09.919 --> 00:58:11.588
ARE NOT ILLEGAL BUT THEY THEY'RE

00:58:11.654 --> 00:58:13.223
THEY'RE A NUISANCE.

00:58:13.289 --> 00:58:16.593
BUT THE ONES THAT ARE USED.

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:19.295
FOR CAMPAIGNS AND POLLS AND AND

00:58:19.362 --> 00:58:20.530
TELEMARKETERS.

00:58:20.597 --> 00:58:22.332
THOSE WILL NOT NOT THOSE WILL

00:58:22.398 --> 00:58:23.666
NOT BE AFFECTED.

00:58:23.733 --> 00:58:25.902
OF THESE ARE THE THE THE ONLY

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.070
ONES THAT ARE THEIR USER YOU ARE

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:30.206
IT THESE ARE LARGE SCALE SCAMS.

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:33.476
THAT SEND -- THOUSANDS OF CALLS

00:58:33.543 --> 00:58:38.781
IN ONE DIAL.

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.617
CALL THIS NUMBER AND WHEN THEY

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:41.918
DO CALL THERE WAITING WITH A

00:58:41.985 --> 00:58:44.387
VERY SOPHISTICATED SCAB.

00:58:44.454 --> 00:58:46.322
UNTENDED TO TO RIP THEM OFF

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.123
BASICALLY.

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:49.525
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:50.560
WE'RE ASKING THE

00:58:50.627 --> 00:58:51.694
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TO PLACE

00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:53.897
TECHNOLOGY THIS TECHNOLOGY IS

00:58:53.963 --> 00:58:55.231
AVAILABLE.

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.699
THEY HATE THE REQUIREMENT I

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.067
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT OTHER

00:58:58.134 --> 00:59:04.874

HOW COMPLEX AND HOW -- EASY IT

00:59:36.005 --> 00:59:40.443
IS FOR THEM -- TO COPY THE

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:42.011

AUTHENTICATION THAT'S ACTUALLY

00:59:45.982 --> 00:59:49.152
CAPTURE -- BUT FROM THE

00:59:49.218 --> 00:59:51.020
TELECOMMUNICATIONS OF

00:59:51.087 --> 00:59:56.125
PERSPECTIVE I'M NOT SURE IF THE

00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:58.294
IF THE TECHNOLOGIES EVEN THERE.

00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:59.762

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:13.376
POINT.

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:14.711
BECAUSE THE AG ALREADY.

01:00:14.777 --> 01:00:16.112
HAS JURISDICTION OVER THIS I'M

01:00:16.179 --> 01:00:20.616
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHY WE NEED --

01:00:20.683 --> 01:00:23.453

TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS.

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:55.485
ONLY BEGUN TO BE UTILIZED THE

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:58.755
BLOCKING OF THESE -- THAT.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:00.590
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CALLS BLOCKS

REAL CONCERNS THAT.

01:01:27.083 --> 01:01:29.719
THE USE OF THIS OF THE TYPE OF

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:30.953
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S BEING.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:32.989

EMERGENCY.

01:01:39.028 --> 01:01:40.329
ALERTS AND SUCH I THINK WE

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.230
WOULD'VE HEARD FROM SUNNOW

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:42.999

WE DO.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:49.005
BUT THIS IS.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:52.275
THIS IS -- THERE'S ENOUGH

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.477
ENTITIES THAT USE.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.446
THESE TYPE OF FOR LEGITIMATE

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:57.814
PURPOSES THAT SOMEONE WOULD HAVE

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.449
HEARD ABOUT IT AND IF THIS WERE

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.450
REAL.

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.218
REALLY SERIOUS CONCERN THAT WAS

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.753
REALLY GOING TO INTERFERE WE

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.254
WOULD HEAR FROM THEM WE ARENOT

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:07.957
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION

LIKE THAT BEFORE US RIGHT NOW.

01:02:09.792 --> 01:02:11.294
THE OPPOSITION THAT WE HAVE IS

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.463
THE TELECOMMUTE TELECOMS AND I

01:02:13.529 --> 01:02:15.331
APPRECIATE THAT THEY WOULD

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:16.499
ALWAYS PREFERRED TO HAVE.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.469
NATIONAL RULES THAT THEY ABIDE

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.271
BY EVERYWHERE AND NOT -- YOU

CLOSE JUST SIMPLY OF THIS IS A

01:02:38.087 --> 01:02:38.621
THIS IS A GROWING PROBLEM I I

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:39.722
DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL BE

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.224
SOLVED WITHOUT.

01:02:41.290 --> 01:02:43.559
ANY KIND OF A REGULAR IN

01:02:43.626 --> 01:02:45.328
INTERVENTION I THINK THIS IS --

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:47.463
UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY WAY WE

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:48.364
CAN FIX THIS.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.999
AND FOR ME THE MOST COMPELLING

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:52.001

WHETHER IT'S EMPLOYABLE OR NOT

01:02:57.673 --> 01:02:59.375
THE THE MOST COMPELLING ARGUMENT

01:02:59.442 --> 01:02:59.842
IS THAT IT.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:03.146
IT IS BEING DONE IT CAN BE DONE.

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.047
CANADA IS GOING TO SHOW US THAT.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:06.449
IT WILL BE DONE.

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:09.418
AT AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:12.755
THAT WE CAN USE AS A IF IF.

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:14.190
YOU KNOW AS A MODEL.

01:03:14.257 --> 01:03:16.859
OF OF WHY A WHY WE CAN DO IT AND
