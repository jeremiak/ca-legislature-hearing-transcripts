SO THERE MAY NOT BE COSTS -- TO

00:32:24.942 --> 00:32:27.378
THE STATE -- IN THE ANALYSIS BUT

00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:29.180
WE DO BELIEVE THEY'LL BE COSTS

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:31.549
FOR PROVIDERS ALSO FOR PATIENTS

00:32:31.616 --> 00:32:33.284

00:33:04.048 --> 00:33:06.217
THAT'S VERY COSTLY TO PROVIDERS

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.619
POTENTIALLY NOT EVEN POSSIBLE --

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:11.589
AND THEN IN ADDITION IF THERE'S

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:14.225

EVEN INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED --

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:18.830
SOMETIMES THAT'S OUTSIDE OF WHAT

00:33:18.896 --> 00:33:19.997
IS THE STANDARD OF CARE SO

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:21.566
YOU'RE ASKING PHYSICIANS TO

NOT EVEN KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

00:33:33.878 --> 00:33:35.213
SOME PHYSICIANS DON'T INHERENTLY

THAT'S BEST YOU ALSO DO NOT NEED

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.854
A REFERRAL FOR MOST OF THESE FOR

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.722
PHYSICAL THERAPY WHICH IS WITHIN

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:45.723
THE MEDICAL HOME AND MOST OF

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.524
THOSE.

00:33:46.591 --> 00:33:48.426

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:54.465
ALREADY DONE BUT YOU DON'T NEED

00:33:54.532 --> 00:33:55.800

A REFERRAL TO GO TO ACUPUNCTURE.

00:33:59.303 --> 00:34:01.406
SO PUTTING A MANDATE IN LAW FOR
