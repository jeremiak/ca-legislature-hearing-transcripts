00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:18.396
QUESTION OF. HOW IS- IS OIL AND

00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:22.567
GAS- POLICY IMPACTED BY A

00:33:22.633 --> 00:33:23.868
DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:26.471
FOSSIL FUELS OVERTIME SO REALLY

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:28.239
THIS QUESTION OF HOW DO WE

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.875
MANAGE THE DECLINE OF DEMAND

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:32.710
FOR FOSSIL FUELS AND WHAT DOES

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:34.679
IT MEAN FOR OUR SUPPLY POLICY.

00:33:34.746 --> 00:33:37.515
THAT STUDY IT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.083
SCOPED MEANING IT IT RECEIVED

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.985
INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:42.387
WHAT THE STUDY SHOULD- SHOULD

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:45.390
FOCUS ON. AND IS GETTING UNDER

00:33:45.456 --> 00:33:47.291
WAY I BELIEVE IN COMING WEEKS A

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.460
TANDEM STUDY OR COMPANION STUDY

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:52.363
ARE ALSO OVERSEEN BY THE-

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.433
CALLIE PA WILL FOCUS ON HOW WE

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.201
CAN REDUCE. EMISSIONS

00:33:57.268 --> 00:33:59.437
TRANSPORTATION AS QUICKLY AS

00:33:59.504 --> 00:34:00.238
POSSIBLE RECOGNIZING THAT'S

00:34:00.304 --> 00:34:01.239
GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL TO MOVE

00:34:01.305 --> 00:34:05.376
TOWARD CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. IN

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:06.577
ALLOW BUDGET LAST YEAR'S BY GOV

00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.646
ALSO MADE A FIVE YEAR

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.615
COMMITMENT REGARDING WORKFORCE

00:34:10.681 --> 00:34:13.050
DEVELOPMENT- TO ENSURE THAT AS

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:16.053
OUR DEMAND FOR ENERGY CHANGES

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.355
AND AS THIS TRANSITION TAKES

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.290
PLACE TO REDUCE THE WARY REDUCE

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.892
DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.162
THAT OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:26.364
CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE PART IN

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:27.799
THOSE NEW INDUSTRIES AND THAT

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.700
AT THIS TRANSITION TAKES PLACE

00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:32.970
NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND. WHO IS

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:35.173

VARIOUS INDUSTRIES SO THAT IS A

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.210
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR

00:34:39.277 --> 00:34:40.745
INVESTMENT OUT THROUGH OUR G.

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:42.313
G. R. AFTER A GREENHOUSE GAS

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.616
REDUCTION FUND PROGRAMS- EACH

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:47.351
YEAR FOR THEEXT FIVE YEARS.

00:34:47.418 --> 00:34:49.120
LET ME JUST LASTLY SAY THAT- IN

00:34:49.187 --> 00:34:50.621
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:52.190
LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:53.391
FIVE BILLS THAT FURTHER

00:36:56.147 --> 00:36:57.348
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE LOOKING

00:36:57.415 --> 00:36:59.717
AT A- A MORE RIGOROUS AYE TYPER

00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:00.918
PERMITTING AND LOOKING PERMIT

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:02.653
TO PERMIT. DO YOU ENVISION ANY

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.488
SCENARIO WHERE YOU WILL EITHER

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:06.123
SEVERELY RESTRICTED NEW PERMITS

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.358
AFTER THE MORATORIUM OR EVEN

00:37:07.425 --> 00:37:08.726
JUST STOP THE PRACTICE ALL

00:37:08.793 --> 00:37:10.828
TOGETHER OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.430
EVEN SPECULATE. WELL FROM OUR

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:14.966
PERSPECTIVE THE LEGISLATURE.

00:37:15.032 --> 00:37:17.268
FOCUSED VERY INTENSELY ON ON

00:37:17.335 --> 00:37:18.703
THE PRACTICE OF HYDRAULIC

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:21.238
FRACTURING IN SENATE BILL FOR-

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:22.440
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HAS

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.108
ESTABLISHED YOU KNOW CLEAR

00:37:24.175 --> 00:37:26.110
LEGISLATIVE OP PARAMETERS AS IT

00:37:26.177 --> 00:37:28.079
RELATES TO THAT PRACTICE. SO

00:37:28.145 --> 00:37:29.780
OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN LAST ABOUT

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.949
REEVALUATING THAT PRACTICE AND

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.284
IN THIS CASE MORE ABOUT

00:37:33.351 --> 00:37:35.252
ENSURING THAT VIOLATED THE-

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.421
THOROUGHNESS OBJECTIVE NOUS OF

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:39.523
OUR PERMITTING PROCESS. SO I

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.325
DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WITHIN

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:42.627
THESE PERMIT BY PERMIT REVIEWS

00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:44.695
OR WITH IN THIS AUDIT PROCESS.

00:37:44.762 --> 00:37:46.063
THAT WE WOULD MAKE FINDINGS

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.999
PROBABLY FURTHER RESTRICTING

00:37:48.065 --> 00:37:49.834
THE PRACTICE. THIS FOCUSED ON

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.769
BOTH THE SAY AUDIT AND THE

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:52.837
PERMIT BY PERMIT REVIEW IS

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:55.139
REALLY ENSURING THAT THE-

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.241
APPROPRIATE STEPS IN THE

00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:57.808
PERMITTING PROCESS HAVE BEEN

00:37:57.875 --> 00:38:01.078
FOLLOWED. OKAY AB TEN FIFTY

00:38:01.145 --> 00:38:02.480
SEVEN REQUIRED CAL GEMS PURPOSE

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.448
TO REGULATE OIL AND GAS

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.416
PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:06.917
PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AS YOU

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:07.485
MENTION OF SAFETY AND

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:08.786
ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY.

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:09.487
INCLUDING REDUCTION IN

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:10.921
MITIGATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS

00:38:10.988 --> 00:38:12.289
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:38:12.356 --> 00:38:13.991
DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROCARBON AND

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.226
GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN A

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:16.594
MANNER THAT MEETS THE ENERGY TO

00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.029
NEEDS OF THE STATE HOW DO YOU

00:38:18.095 --> 00:38:19.096
INTERPRET THAT REQUIREMENT HOW

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:21.098
DO YOU SEE. YOUR POLICIES

00:38:21.165 --> 00:38:23.534
ALTERING TO SATISFY- THAT

00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:25.369
DEMAND YEAH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:27.104
TALKED ABOUT A LONG TERM

00:38:27.171 --> 00:38:29.306
TRANSITION TO REDUCING OUR

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:30.374
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND-

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.876
AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVING

00:38:31.942 --> 00:38:33.744
CLIMATE NEUTRALITY AND THAT

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:35.446
WILL OBVIOUSLY INVOLVE A

00:38:35.513 --> 00:38:37.648
TRANSITION. ARE AWAY FROM

00:38:37.715 --> 00:38:40.017
FOSSIL FUELS I'LL MENTION THAT

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:43.220
OUTSIDE OF POLICY MAKING THE

00:38:43.287 --> 00:38:44.588
PRODUCTION OF OIL AND OIL AND

00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:46.257
CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY DECLINE

00:38:46.323 --> 00:38:49.694
SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES- AS I

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.095
UNDERSTAND IT AS A RESULT OF.

00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.496
MEDICATIONS AND ACTUALLY BEING

00:38:52.563 --> 00:38:55.232
ABLE TO ADD- BY THE SUPPLY BUT

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.234
IN ANY EVENT OUR VISION IS

00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:00.271
THERE IS CLEARLY A TRANSITION

00:39:00.337 --> 00:39:02.373
THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. IN

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.241
ORDER TO ABIDE STATE WATER

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:04.842
REDUCE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN

00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:05.476
THE STATE DIVISION FOR CLIMATE

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.545
NEUTRALLY. THAT TRANSITION

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.146
HOUSE TO BE THOUGHTFUL. AND

00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:12.783
TAKE I AM YOU SAID IT BOTH BOTH

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:13.751
REVIEWS BOTH THOSE WORDS IN

00:39:13.818 --> 00:39:18.656
TERMS OF THOUGHT FALL. AND TAKE

00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:21.692
TIME AND THAT WE MEAN. AFTER AN

00:39:21.759 --> 00:39:22.927
WRECKED AS THAT THERE ARE A LOT

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:29.734
OF WOMEN IN CAL WORK AS AN. AND

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.302
ANY TRACK XIN. ARMED THAT CHEFS

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:32.169
OUR DEPENDENCE ON AND A SOURCE.

00:39:32.236 --> 00:39:32.803
ARE WE REALLY HAVE TO PHùON

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:33.971
IN A- CONTINUED OPPORTUNE FOR

00:39:34.038 --> 00:39:35.406
THOSE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHAT

00:39:35.473 --> 00:39:37.308
IS KNOWN IN. IN THIS IN THESE

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.943
POLICY DISCUSSIONS AS A JUST

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.978
TRANSITION- BUT THEN ALSO

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.580
RECOGNIZING OUR CONTINUED

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:43.681
DEMAND FOR OIL AND GAS IN THE

00:39:43.748 --> 00:39:46.250
STATE- AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW

00:39:46.317 --> 00:39:48.786
OUR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS.

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.588
NOT BEING REDUCED AND HOW WE

00:39:50.654 --> 00:39:52.890
CONTINUE TO HAVE. HIGH DEMANDS

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:55.826
FOR. GASOLINE ABOUT A THIRD OF

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:56.660
WHICH IS PRODUCED USING

00:39:56.727 --> 00:39:59.797
CALIFORNIA A SUPPLY. OUR NEXT

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.165
STEP TO REALLY NAVIGATING WHAT

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:03.868
IS THE PATHWAY- ON THIS

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:06.137
INTERSECTION BETWEEN- FOSSIL

00:40:06.203 --> 00:40:07.938
FUEL DEMAND AND ANY SUPPLY

00:40:08.005 --> 00:40:09.940
POLICY IS THIS INDEPENDENT

00:40:10.007 --> 00:40:11.876
STUDY AT THE UC IS INITIATING.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:14.211
AND THAT WILL IDENTIFY OP

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.913
POTENTIAL PATHWAYS ON THAT

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.882
COULD INFORM OUR SUPPLY POLICY

00:40:17.948 --> 00:40:19.583
AS WE REDUCE OUR DEMAND IN

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.186
COMING DECADES- WE ARE NOT IN A

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.254
POSITION NOR ARE WE DIRECTING

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.689
CAL JAM TO BE IN A POSITION TO-

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:29.193
MAKE- BLASTING DECISIONS

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.195
REGARDING. OUR OIL SUPPLY-

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.297
SHORT OF AN ESTABLISHED PATHWAY

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:35.499
THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRANSPARENT

00:40:35.566 --> 00:40:38.469
AND I AND IN STUDY VERY

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:40.838
CAREFULLY. AND I'M CURIOUS ARE

00:40:40.905 --> 00:40:41.872
THERE ANY OTHER NATIONS AND

00:40:41.939 --> 00:40:42.907
WE'RE NOT A NATION BUT ARE

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:44.708
THERE ANY NATION'S WE CAN LOOK

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:46.343
TO WHERE YOU FEEL THAT THEY ARE

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.045
ACTIVELY TRYING TO MANAGE THAT

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.647
A DEMAND REDUCTION ANY ANY GOOD

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.448
MODELS OUT THERE. WELL

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:52.850
CERTAINLY I MEAN I THINK

00:40:52.917 --> 00:40:54.752
CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN

00:40:54.819 --> 00:40:56.587
REDUCING OUR DEMAND IN THE

00:40:56.654 --> 00:40:59.156
SENSE THAT WE HAVE- ONE OF THE

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:00.991
HIGHEST PENETRATIONS OF

00:41:01.058 --> 00:41:02.459
ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE'VE SHIFTED.

00:41:02.526 --> 00:41:05.329
MANY OF MUCH OF OUR ENERGY

00:41:05.396 --> 00:41:05.896
GENERATION TO FOLLOW UP ALSO

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:08.766
FREE- OF ENERGY. I THINK THAT

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.800
ARE REALLY STRONG PARTNERSHIPS

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:11.335
THAT CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.770
BASES ACROSS THE WORLD TO

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:16.373
REDUCE. OUR FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND-

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.209
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED COMPLY.

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:21.212
QUESTION ABOUT- HOW TO MANAGE

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:27.251
OUR OIL AND GAS SUPPLY- WHILE

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:27.852
WE ARE WHILE OUR ECONOMY'S TO

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:30.254
ME. THAT RESOURCE. I'M SORRY

00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:31.488
YOUR WE FIRST SO LEGISLATOR MAN

00:41:31.555 --> 00:41:33.524
MANDATE REPORTS FROM CAL JAM

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.092
THE WEEK BEFORE THIS HEARING

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.061
AND WE APPRECIATE THE RELEASE

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.128
OF THE REPORTS AND CERTAINLY

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:40.497
FOR OUR HEARINGS- PURPOSES IT

00:41:40.564 --> 00:41:42.366
WAS GOOD TIMING BUT MANY OF

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:43.901
THESE REPORTS WERE ALMOST SIX

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:45.169
MONTHS LATE AND I'M WONDERING

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:46.737
IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:49.173
SPEEDING UP THE- TRANSPARENCY

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.407
IN RELEASE OF INFORMATION TO

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:53.244
THE PUBLIC AND- WHAT YOU'RE

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:54.712
DOING TO ENSURE THAT REPORTS

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.046
ARE TIMELY IN THAT INFORMATION

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.514
GETS OUT IN A MORE TIMELY

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:59.683
MANNER YEAH WELL SAY. WE NEED

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.052
TO DO BETTER OUR COMMITMENT IS

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.988
TO GET THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION

00:42:04.054 --> 00:42:05.656
NOT TO THE LEGISLATIVE

00:42:05.723 --> 00:42:06.523
LEGISLATURE AS QUICKLY AS WE

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:09.193
CAN- IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A YEAR

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.995
OF TRANSITION AT THE DEPARTMENT

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:13.230
OF CONSERVATION AND AT CAL JAM

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.965
I IN SO MUCH OF OUR FOCUS WAS

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.100
GETTING THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN

00:42:16.166 --> 00:42:17.434
PLACE IN ANNOUNCING THESE

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:19.470
INITIATIVES ABOUT MOVING FOR IT

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:21.338
I THINK YOU CAN AND SHOULD

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:23.407
EXPECT- THAT MORE TIMELY

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.675

CROWFOOT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION-

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:37.922
A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF ITEMS

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:39.123
THAT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON AND

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.791
FIRST YOU TALK YOU MENTIONED

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:42.326
THE MORATORIUM. AND THE

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.161
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CAME LAST.

00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.630
SUMMER IT IN A YOU KNOW AS A

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:49.033
RESULT. OF SOME OF THE

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.834
CONCERNS- I FROM THE

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.102
ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS IN

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.171
OUR STATE. THE MORATORIUM

00:42:54.238 --> 00:42:57.975
SPECIFICALLY AS- IT IS RELATED

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:00.945
TO STEAM INJECTION- AT BUT IT

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:03.948
DOESN'T COVER ALL TYPE OF THE-

00:43:04.014 --> 00:43:06.383
STEAM INJECTION SO. CAN YOU

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.285
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THE

00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:11.455
LOW PRESSURE- WAS NOT COVERED

00:43:11.522 --> 00:43:12.656
UNDER THE MORATORIUM OR WITH

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:14.992
THE THOUGHTS ARE FOR YOU KNOW

00:43:15.059 --> 00:43:16.860
WHERE THE MORE TRAIN WAS REALLY

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:17.928
ABOUT PARTIAL USE NOT VERSE IS

00:43:17.995 --> 00:43:20.130
NOT FULL. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:22.066
THE MORATORIUM ON HIGH PRESSURE

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:22.900
STEAM INJECTIONS ABOVE THE

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:25.402
FRACTURE GRADIENT. INTENSELY

00:43:25.469 --> 00:43:27.671
FOCUSED ON THIS CHALLENGE THAT

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:28.672
THE STATE IS HAVING WITH

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:30.541
SURFACE EXPRESSIONS OR SO

00:43:30.607 --> 00:43:33.210
CALLED OIL SPILLS WHERE THERE

00:43:33.277 --> 00:43:34.611
IS UNPREDICTED ON TROLL OIL

00:43:34.678 --> 00:43:38.849
BUBBLING UP TO THE SURFACE. OUR

00:43:38.916 --> 00:43:39.550
TECHNICAL STAFF AT JAM BELIEVE

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.251
THAT THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION IN

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:43.087
AT LEAST SOME OF THE OIL FIELDS

00:43:43.153 --> 00:43:44.722
ARE BETWEEN THIS HIGH PRESSURE

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:45.489
STEAM INJECTION ABOUT THE

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:47.191
FRACTURE GRADIENT AND THOSE

00:43:47.257 --> 00:43:49.660
UNCONTROLLED UNPREDICTED OIL

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:51.762
SPILLS. REGULATIONS THAT TOOK

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:54.598
EFFECT LAST APRIL- SPECIFICALLY

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:57.101
PROHIBIT SURFACE EXPRESSIONS.

00:43:57.167 --> 00:44:00.304
AND INSTITUTED NEW RULES TO

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.006
ELIMINATE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS

00:44:02.072 --> 00:44:03.073
DESPITE THOSE STRONGER

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:05.209
REGULATIONS AS OF APRIL WE

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:06.710
EXPERIENCE THIS SPATE OF

00:44:06.777 --> 00:44:08.012
SURFACE EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.813
THE SUMMER INCLUDING THE

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:12.016
LARGEST. OIL SPILL LAND BASED

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:14.084
OIL SPILL IN IN IN RECORDED

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.686
HISTORY IN THE STATE THE SAME

00:44:15.753 --> 00:44:17.121
RECOIL SPELL THAT YOU HEAR MORE

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:19.323
ABOUT. AS A RESULT OF THAT. OUR

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.558
TECHNICAL STAFF A CAL JAM ARE

00:44:21.625 --> 00:44:24.028
RECOMMENDED A MORATORIUM ON

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:27.831
THIS PRACTICE ON UNTIL AN

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:29.933
INDEPENDENT REVIEW. PLACE I'M-

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.634
OUT CHEN BUT WITH LAWRENCE

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:33.404
LIVERMORE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:34.805
IF THAT PRACTICE OF HIGH

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:36.206
PRESSURE STEAM INJECTIONS BUT

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:38.509
THE FRACTURE GRADIENT CAN BE

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:42.046
CONDUCTED SAFELY IF. AND THEN

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:42.613
IF IT CAN BE CONDUCTED SAY.

00:44:42.679 --> 00:44:44.048
WHERE AND HOW IT CAN BE.

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:48.585
CONDUCTED SAY. OUR OUR WILL OR

00:44:48.652 --> 00:44:49.219
ACTUALLY A RESPONSIVE IS TO A

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:50.387
LIMB SURF EXPRESSIONS TO

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:51.855
ELIMINATE THESE UNCONTROLLED

00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:54.391
UNPREDICTABLE- LAND BASED OIL

00:44:54.458 --> 00:44:57.361
SPILLS ARE MORATORIUM HELPS US

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:59.663
GET WE BELIEVE GET A HANDLE ON

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.765
WHETHER THAT PRACTICE IS

00:45:01.832 --> 00:45:04.301
ESSENTIALLY PART OF THE PROBLEM.

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:05.969
AND MORE TRAM AGAIN IT WAS

00:45:06.036 --> 00:45:07.738
PARTIAL AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.173
WHY THE IT WAS INCLUDED IT WAS

00:45:09.239 --> 00:45:10.541
IT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.042
RESPONSE TO THIS IMMEDIATE OIL

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:14.044
SPILL OR WAS IT BECAUSE THERE

00:45:14.111 --> 00:45:15.846
IS GREATER RESEARCHER CITY

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.414
THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE ON LOW

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:20.017
PRESSURE. SUPERVISOR IN TALK AT

00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:21.351
A PETROLEUM ENGINEER WILL BE

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.352
ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.587
MORE INTELLIGENTLY THAN I WILL

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:26.757
BUT I WILL SAY. THAT THE

00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:28.292
PRACTICES OF CYCLIC STEAMING

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:30.027
BELOW THE FRACTURE GREAT IN AND

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:30.761
SEPTIC STEAMING ABOVE THE

00:45:30.828 --> 00:45:31.929
FRACTURE GRADING WE'RE ACTUALLY

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:35.199
BREAKING SUBSURFACE OP- ARE TWO

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.366
DISTINCT PRACTICES AND IT FELL

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:39.436
OUT- ABOVE THE FRACTURE IN

00:45:39.503 --> 00:45:40.637
WHERE IF OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTS

00:45:40.704 --> 00:45:43.607
HAVE THE MOST CONCERN LEADING

00:45:43.674 --> 00:45:45.342
THE FOR SERVICE EXPRESS. Q. AND

00:45:45.409 --> 00:45:47.077
THE OTHER PIECE THE I WANTED TO

00:45:47.144 --> 00:45:48.846
AND ARE CHAIR AT TO TOUCH A

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:50.280
LITTLE BIT ON IT WAS THE C. C.

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:54.218
S. T. S. SUMMARY. AND IN

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:55.686
ADDITION TO JUST THE TIMING OF

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:58.155
IT I'M ACTUALLY- WANTING TO

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:01.358
KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.726
FOR THE DEPARTMENT IF THERE'S

00:46:02.793 --> 00:46:04.261
ANY THOUGHTS- THERE ARE

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:06.096
CURRENTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND

00:46:06.163 --> 00:46:08.832
OIL WELLS IN CALIFORNIA- THAT.

00:46:08.899 --> 00:46:11.068
THAT TO US WE COULD END UP

00:46:11.135 --> 00:46:12.603
PLAYING THE CLEAN UP COST FOR

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:15.739
THAT OUR ORPHAN WELLS SO. IF

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.974
THAT WERE THE CASE WORST CASE

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.509
SCENARIO WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:46:18.575 --> 00:46:20.344
ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:22.746
MILLION TO FIVE TO NINE BILLION

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:26.250
DOLLARS- DEPENDING ON- THE YOU

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.619
KNOW THE OUR ABILITY TO CLEAN

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:30.287
UP AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF

00:46:30.354 --> 00:46:33.290
YOU CAN COMMENT. ON HOW YOU

00:46:33.357 --> 00:46:35.859
KNOW WHAT'S NEXT YEAH SO ACROSS

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.960
THE COMPANY ARE ALL ACROSS THE

00:46:37.027 --> 00:46:38.862
COUNTRY- GOVERNMENTS FACE THIS

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:40.864
CHALLENGE OF POTENTIALLY LARGE

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:42.533
VERY LARGE- FINANCIAL

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:46.170
LIABILITY. OFF FOR- OF WELLS

00:46:46.236 --> 00:46:47.571
THAT HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN

00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:48.939
ORPHANED ON THAT WERE ONCE

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:51.275
OWNED BY A PRIVATE OPERATOR BUT

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:53.610
THAT GET LAPPED- HAVE PROBLEMS

00:46:53.677 --> 00:46:55.779
I THEN GOT NEED TO NOT. AND

00:46:55.846 --> 00:46:56.613
ACTUALLY STATES ACROSS THE

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:58.415
COUNTRY ARE FACING THIS I

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:01.752
WOULD- OBSERVE WE IN CALIFORNIA

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:02.319
HAVE THIS CHALLENGE AS WELL.

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:05.455
AND SO LJ I'M ACTUALLY BE

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.790
SEVERAL YEARS AGO I REQUESTED

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.525
THAT CCS T. WHICH IS THAT

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:09.693
CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.495
TECHNOLOGY REALLY OBJECTIVE

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:14.164
INDEPENDENT EXPERTS. STUDY THE

00:47:14.231 --> 00:47:15.699
POTENTIAL FINANCIAL LIABILITY

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:18.235
THAT THE STATE HAS- THAT

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:20.804
REPORT- THAT WAS JUST RELEASED

00:47:20.871 --> 00:47:24.141
DEMONSTRATES A SIGNIFICANT OUT

00:47:24.208 --> 00:47:26.710
OUT. THANKS LIABILITY FOR THIS.

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.912
I'M OUR RESPONSE IS AT LEAST

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:31.081
TWO FOLD- ONE IS TO IMPLEMENT

00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:42.025
TO PUT UP MORE RESOURCES MORE

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:43.827

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.906
SOME LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY ONTO

00:47:55.973 --> 00:47:57.474

00:48:04.314 --> 00:48:05.382
WOULD CONSIDER TO BE EXCESSIVE

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:07.351
BONDING REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAVE

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.652
TO GET THIS RIGHT WE HAVE TO

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:09.953
ENSURE THAT COMPANIES ARE

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.922

YEAR. WELL IT'S SOMETHING WE

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.754
SHOULD MAKE AND I DON'T WANNA

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.622
MAJOR QUESTION SOMETHING WE

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.990
SHOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:43.426
YEAR WHAT I'M LEARNING. ABOUT

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.795
OUR RULE MAKING PROCESS IS IT'S

01:02:45.862 --> 01:02:46.896
VERY CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE

FINISH THIS YEAR I THINK THAT'S

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:54.504
UNREALISTIC- BUT YOU CAN

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:55.972
CERTAINLY ASK OTHERS WHO WHO

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:58.074

01:03:00.009 --> 01:03:02.478
WILL DIG IN AND I'M JUST HOPING

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.513
WE CAN HAVE SOME

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.481
PRIORITIZATION. IS THERE'S SO

01:03:05.548 --> 01:03:08.251
MANY WELLS OUT THERE AND WE'RE

01:03:08.317 --> 01:03:10.186
JUST I MET THE ACTIVE YOU I SEE

01:03:10.253 --> 01:03:11.020
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.256
ABANDONED WELLS AND- YOU KNOW.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.891
THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.826
LIABILITY WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:17.527
THERE'S A BIT OF A NEW

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:18.861
FRAMEWORK IN PLACE- THANKS TO

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:22.365
SOME COLLEAGUES WORK HERE BUT-

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:23.766
LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A

01:03:23.833 --> 01:03:25.768
PRODUCTIVE PRIORITIZATION LOOKS

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:30.640
LIKE SO THAT. ESPECIALLY THOSE

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:34.277
PROJECTS HAVE A REAL PEOPLE IT

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:37.013
FACE. RIGHT THAT ARE CLOSEST TO.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:39.382
THAT ARE FRONT LINES- THAT THEY

01:03:39.448 --> 01:03:42.418
HAVE SOME CERTAINTY ABOUT- WHAT

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:45.087
THEY CAN EXPECT- YOU KNOW THIS

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:47.423
IS URBAN LOS ANGELES DOWN IN

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:48.257
THE LONG BEACH NORTHERN

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:50.726
CALIFORNIA RIGHT I BACKYARDS

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.361
ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WE ARE AN

01:03:52.428 --> 01:03:55.298
ALL STATE. WE STILL ARE DESPITE

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:58.334
ALL OUR- ENERGY GOAL THEN CLUB.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.636
RATIONS I THINK IT'S TIME WE

01:04:00.703 --> 01:04:02.405
GET HONEST ABOUT THIS I GUESS

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.773
THAT WAS MY OTHER QUESTION IT

01:04:03.839 --> 01:04:05.041
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY.

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:08.945
TOUCHED ON IT SOMEWHAT BUT-

01:04:09.011 --> 01:04:12.014
YEAH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TIME

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.916
LINE OR PLANNING IS AROUND

01:04:13.983 --> 01:04:15.117
FINISHING THIS CARBON

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:18.020
NEUTRALITY STUDY AND HOW TO

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:18.621
REALLY WRESTLE WITH THOSE BIG

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.056
PICTURE ISSUES THEY HAVE A

01:04:20.122 --> 01:04:22.258
SENSE FOR US OF I KNOW YOU'VE

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.660
BEEN DOING YOUR- YOUR LISTEN

NOW LISTENING TO OUR MEDICAL

01:04:26.562 --> 01:04:29.498
SCOPING PROCESS. HE WAS KERN

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:31.867
COUNTY HEARING THE OTHER DAY.

01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:32.902
ZOOMING IS PROBABLY FEW MORE

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:34.704
SCHEDULE BUT GIVE SAYS SORT OF

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:38.874
SENSE OF. HOW YOU GUYS WANT TO.

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.743
ONE WHAT TIME WHEN YOU WERE

01:04:40.810 --> 01:04:41.344
WRESTLE WITH THE STUDY ITSELF

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.379
AND THEN. REALLY WHAT TO DO

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:45.648
ABOUT IT YOU YOU OVERSEE NOT

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.617
JUST OIL AND GAS BUT ALL THE

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.118
NATURAL AND WORKING LATE IN THE

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:51.854
STATE AND- AS FRUSTRATING AS

01:04:51.921 --> 01:04:53.489
SOME OF THE SETBACKS MAYBE I

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.358
ALSO THINK THERE'S- SOME HUGE

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:56.826
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THIS

01:04:56.892 --> 01:05:00.763
STATE A NET- ANNETTE. SEQUESTER

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.431
CARBON TO ACTUALLY TAKE SOME OF

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:03.699
THIS POLLUTION AND REMOVE IT

01:05:03.766 --> 01:05:05.534
THROUGH BETTER AG MANAGEMENT

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.503
PRACTICES TO BET FORCE

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:10.706
MANAGEMENT- SMARTER USE A BIO

01:05:10.773 --> 01:05:13.142
MASS OF THINGS THAT- DON'T

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:14.510
ACTUALLY DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.379
OIL INDUSTRY BUT- HOW DOES THAT

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.114
HELP YOU HELP US PEACE ALL THAT

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:21.183
TOGETHER SIR WHAT WHAT DO YOU.

01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:21.751
WHAT DO YOU GUYS LOOKING AT

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.219
HERE AND YOUR HEAD. SO WE ARE

01:05:23.286 --> 01:05:25.154
LOOKING AT COMPLETING- I

01:05:25.221 --> 01:05:26.656
BELIEVE BOTH OF THE STUDIES

01:05:26.722 --> 01:05:27.823
THAT I MENTIONED I THINK BEFORE

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.525
YOU CAME IN ESSENTIALLY TANDEM

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.227
STUDIES. ARE MANAGED BY OUR

01:05:31.294 --> 01:05:33.629
SISTER AGENCY CAL CALIFORNIAN

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:35.765
BY MY PROTECTION AGENCY. ONE

01:05:35.831 --> 01:05:38.601
BEING FOCUSED ON. WHAT WHAT IS

01:05:38.668 --> 01:05:39.835
THE PATHWAY TO CLIMATE

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:42.338
NEUTRALITY AS IT RELATES TO

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.240
FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND AND SUPPLY.

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:46.676
NOW WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON AS

01:05:46.742 --> 01:05:49.178
WE REDUCE OUR BY THE DEMAND FOR

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.613
FOSSIL FUELS HOW SHOULD THAT

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:52.948
INFORM OUR POLICY ON OIL AND

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:54.950
GAS SUPPLY IN THE STATE. THAT'S

01:05:55.017 --> 01:05:56.419
A COMPLEX SORT OF ALMOST ON

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.754
PRESIDENT A QUESTION. I AND SO

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.589
OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO REALLY

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.657
BRING IN THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST

01:06:01.724 --> 01:06:03.359
MINDS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE UC

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.027
SYSTEM. TO COMPLETE AN

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:07.330
INDEPENDENT REPORT OR STUDY TO

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.165
REALLY EVALUATE PATHWAYS TO

01:06:09.231 --> 01:06:11.400
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. ARE THE

01:06:11.467 --> 01:06:13.502
TEN THIS THE COMPANION STUDY IS

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.104
MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE NEED TO

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.807
BE DOING TO INTENSIFY I-

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:18.507
LECTURE FOR CATION OF

01:06:18.574 --> 01:06:20.643
TRANSPORTATION A REDUCTION OF

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.611
POLLUTION FROM TRANSPORTATION.

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:23.846
I AND AGAIN I BELIEVE WE

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.848
ANTICIPATE DROPS OF BOTH OF

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:27.683
THOSE REPORTS TO THIS YEAR.

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.919
OKAY RIGHT ARM AND LASTLY ALL

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:31.587
DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AFTER

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.656
THIS- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE

01:06:33.723 --> 01:06:38.694
WHETHER- THEY'RE GONNA BE ANY.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:39.929
I KNOW THERE'S A MORATORIUM AND

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:43.632
IS CURRENTLY ON- ON NEW-

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.302
PROJECTS- SORT OF ABOVE A

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:48.270
CERTAIN FRACTURE GRADIENT ABOVE

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.673
A CERTAIN PRESSURE GRADIENT-

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.774
FOR YOU I SEE PROJECTS AROUND

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.276
THE STATE BUT- THE BROADER

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:56.545
ISSUE UNDERLYING IT LITERALLY

01:06:56.612 --> 01:06:59.682
PHYSICALLY IS THE AQUA FIRST-

01:06:59.749 --> 01:07:01.083
AND WE HAVE A LOT OF EXEMPT

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:02.918
AQUIFER'S IN THE STATE- THAT

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:05.688
OUR- IS THE- BEYOND REPAIR. BUT

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.224
WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE NOT AND

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:09.258
TRY TO SQUARE THOSE TWO

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.360
CATEGORIES AND ARE THOSE REALLY

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.295
LIST ON THE EXAM DOCTOR FOR

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:16.665
LIST SHOULD ACTUALLY BE THERE-

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:18.033
ANY THOUGHTS AND JUST SORT OF.

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.035
GROUNDWATER IMPACT AND WHETHER

01:07:20.102 --> 01:07:23.672
YOU WILL ANTICIPATE EXPANDING-

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:25.007
AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS DO YOU

01:07:25.074 --> 01:07:27.410
ANTICIPATE ACTUALLY- MAKING IT

01:07:27.476 --> 01:07:29.612
A NEW REQUEST FOR AQUIFER

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:31.614
EXEMPTION EXPANSIONS- HOW HOW

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:34.016
ARE YOU FEELING THAT. SO WE

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.317
WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:36.719
STATE WATER BOARD IN A REGIONAL

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.454
WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS

01:07:38.521 --> 01:07:40.656
WHO ARE REALLY ARE KEY PARTNER-

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:42.291
ON THIS QUESTION OF ENSURING

01:07:42.358 --> 01:07:43.759
THAT ANY OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.294
DOESN'T HAVE IMPACTS ON

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:46.896
AQUIFERS THAT COULD BE EVEN

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:51.400
REMOTELY USED- FOR. HUMAN USE.

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.902
THAT PARTNERSHIP EXTENDS ALSO

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.203
TO THE US ENVIRONMENTAL

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:56.138
PROTECTION AGENCY SO THERE'S

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:57.840
QUITE A CAREFUL GROUP OF

01:07:57.907 --> 01:07:59.742
TECHNICAL EXPERTS THAT ARE

01:07:59.809 --> 01:08:02.778
ADVISING I THE DIVISION- CAL

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:04.680
JAM- ON THIS QUESTION AROUND

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.582
WHICH AQUIFER'S ARE PROPRIA OIL

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:10.386
AND GAS- WE AND ONE OF THE

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:11.287
REASONS WHY WE BROUGHT UP

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.456
BROUGHT ON SUPERVISOR AND TALK-

01:08:13.522 --> 01:08:14.323
AS OUR NEW OIL AND GAS

01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:15.991
SUPERVISOR IS HIS. HIS

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:17.259
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND IN

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:19.428
PETROLEUM ENGINEERING AND HE IS

01:08:19.495 --> 01:08:20.596
FOCUSING ON THE ON THIS

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.431
QUESTION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT

01:08:22.498 --> 01:08:23.666
OUR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

01:08:23.732 --> 01:08:25.701
DOESN'T HAVE IMPACTS ON ON

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:27.903
DRINKING WATER AQUIFERS- THERE

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.238
IS A STRONG REGULATORY

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:30.573
FRAMEWORK IN PLACE FOR DOING

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.908
THAT AND WE JUST NEED TO ENSURE

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:35.211
THAT THAT'S IMPLEMENTED TO THE

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.679
FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. BUT

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:37.646
DESPITE THE POINT NO PLAN ON

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:40.182
EXPANDING EXEMPTIONS. NO WELL

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:42.551
OCT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:43.986
BEST DIRECTED FOR THE

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.323
SUPERVISOR IN PART BECAUSE THIS

01:08:47.389 --> 01:08:48.724
THIS REQUEST FOR AQUIFER

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.360
EXEMPTIONS IS SORT OF WHEN IT

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:51.927
ONE OF THE MANY PERMITTING

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.362
REQUEST THAT WE GET IN THE

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:54.930
STATE. FINISHED AND SO THE

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.065
QUESTION OF WHETHER WE ARE

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:56.966
APPROVING NEW AQUIFER

01:08:57.032 --> 01:08:58.033
EXEMPTIONS THAT I WANT TO

01:08:58.100 --> 01:08:59.635
SUGGEST THAT THE EXPANDING BUT

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:01.670
I THINK HE'S BEST ANSWER.

01:09:01.737 --> 01:09:03.572
SOUTHERN SOUNDS LIKE SENATE

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.007
JACKSON GORGEOUS CENTER BOARD

01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:07.143

BECAUSE YOU TALKED ABOUT-

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.058
THERE'S A UC STUDY THAT'S

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.529
FORTHCOMING AND THE IMPORTANCE

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:29.565
OF SUPPLY CALCULATION- WHICH WE

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:31.066
ARE COMMON A MOMENT AGO THAT IN

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.401
MANY RESPECTS WE STILL AREN'T

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:34.136
OIL STATE OR AT LEAST

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.906
INDUSTRIES- ARE RELIANT ON THAT

BLOWING THE LEAVES OFF OUR LAWN

01:10:34.363 --> 01:10:36.332
TO OUR OUR NEIGHBORS BUT- IN

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:36.932
TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY WE'RE

01:10:36.999 --> 01:10:38.467
IMPORTING FROM DRACONIAN

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.269
REGIMES ELSEWHERE IN THE CUT IN

01:10:40.336 --> 01:10:42.237
THE WORLD. THEY DO NOT LIKE US

WE APPRECIATE THE LAW OF

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.650
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WE

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.085
CAN DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES

01:10:56.151 --> 01:10:58.253
OF THOSE EVENTS BUT WERE

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.388
MINDFUL OF THEM BECAUSE MY

01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:00.623
CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:03.726
ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE. OF YOUR

WEATHER BEAT THE WORK FORCE- OR

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:07.730
THE IDEA THAT WE'RE IMPORTING

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.698
OIL AND OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY

01:11:09.765 --> 01:11:12.234
FROM REALLY ROUGH PARTS OF THE

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:14.603

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.513
FOREMOST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.382
EXPANDING CONSUMER CHOICES TO

01:11:26.448 --> 01:11:28.817
REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:31.186
FUELS SO FOR EXAMPLE. ARE

01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.522

PERCENT. THAT BEING SAD IT'S A

01:11:52.908 --> 01:11:55.077
COMPLICATED QUESTION ABOUT WHAT

FOSSIL FUEL THAT WE NEED TO

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:44.326
MAKE BUT IT HAS TO TAKE PLACE

01:12:44.393 --> 01:12:46.395
CAREFULLY TO AVOID.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:49.231
CONSEQUENCES WHEN THOSE REPORTS

COMMUNITIES WHICH IRONICALLY

01:14:56.425 --> 01:14:59.461
ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU'D

DATA BECAUSE THERE IS A STRONG

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:28.590
BELIEF BASED UPON EVIDENCE THAT

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:32.194
HAS ARISEN THAT THESE ARE

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.496
AQUIFER'S OUT WITH OIL WASTE

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:37.532
WATER ARE- AN IMPACT IN A

01:15:37.599 --> 01:15:39.401
POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE TO THE-

BEING DRILLED THERE- AN ACTION

01:16:06.795 --> 01:16:08.864
DEBATE. AND YET AT THE SAME

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.799
TIME THERE'S AN ONGOING STUDY

STILL PENDING THERE- BY THE US

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:14.736
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY I DON'T KNOW

QUESTION WHETHER- WASTE WATER

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.711
THAT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE OIL

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.579
COMPANIES TO STASH UNDERGROUND

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:25.781
IS GOING TO BECOME A DRINKING

WATER SUPPLY- THAT ARE ALREADY

01:16:28.283 --> 01:16:29.451
FACING SIGNIFICANT WATER

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:31.153
POLLUTION TO WATER QUALITY.

01:16:31.219 --> 01:16:33.822

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:19.468
GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IS COMPLETED

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:21.403
IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS A- A

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:25.340
MOVE TO GRANT EXEMPTIONS. UP OF

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:27.175
RATHER THAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:17:27.242 --> 01:17:29.745
MORE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THEM AND

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:31.980
I GET CONCERNED WHEN WE TALK

MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS THE

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:22.517
PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED FIFTY

01:20:22.584 --> 01:20:25.387
YEARS AGO TO COMPLY WITH TITLE

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.567
PUDDING IS ALWAYS IN IN THE IN

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:39.367
THE EATING AND I'LL BE VERY

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:41.102
INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT.

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.370
ANNOUNCEMENTS AND

01:20:42.437 --> 01:20:44.606
PRONOUNCEMENTS YOU MAKE ON ON

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:46.675
THIS ISSUE AND PARTICULARLY.

01:20:46.741 --> 01:20:47.842
ARE WE GONNA BUT WE CAN TRY TO

01:20:47.909 --> 01:20:51.213
MEET THOSE- GHG REDUCTION GOALS

01:20:51.279 --> 01:20:53.315
WE GONNA TRY TO BECOME. MORE

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.617
ENERGY INDEPENDENT. YOU KNOW I

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.687
CAN'T. SAUDI ARABIA OF PROBABLY

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.589
THE REASONS IT'S PRODUCTION IS

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.123
GONE UP OUR MULTI PURPOSE MULTI

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:04.326
FOLD. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:06.661
ONLY DO WHAT WE CAN DO BUT IF

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:08.029
WE ARE REALLY GOING TO MEET AND

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:09.965
BE SERIOUS ABOUT THOSE GOALS

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.466
WE'VE GOT TO SEE. SOME TIME

01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:15.804
TABLES AND SOME. ACTUAL RESULTS

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.404
INTO A LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:20.875

SECRETARY CROWFOOT APPRECIATE

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.680
YOU BEING HERE AND TAKE YOUR

01:21:25.747 --> 01:21:26.615
TIME I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:27.816
TODAY SO I'M JUST GONNA KEEP MY

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.551
REMARKS VERY VERY SHORT BUT IN

01:21:29.618 --> 01:21:30.952
A FEW CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD

01:21:31.019 --> 01:21:32.621
REALLY ACTUALLY OVER YOUR

01:21:32.687 --> 01:21:33.221
POLICY OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:35.257
FEW MONTHS I WHEN I START HERE

01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:37.025
IN TRANSITION WHEN I WHEN THAT

01:21:37.092 --> 01:21:38.326
WHEN I HEAR THAT WORD

01:21:38.393 --> 01:21:39.561
TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS

01:21:39.628 --> 01:21:41.563
INTO A GREENER ECONOMY COMING

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:42.631
FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS OF

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.266
MY COLLEAGUES HERE. WHAT I

01:21:44.332 --> 01:21:46.534
ACTUALLY HERE IS COST OF LIVING

01:21:46.601 --> 01:21:48.770
ISSUES AND SO WHEN I HEAR YOU

01:21:48.837 --> 01:21:51.573
SAY MINDFUL AND TAKE TIME LIKE

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.440
I THINK THOSE ARE VERY

01:21:52.507 --> 01:21:54.075
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT SOME OF

01:21:54.142 --> 01:21:54.976
OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T ALWAYS

01:21:55.043 --> 01:21:56.845
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE AS AN

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:58.580
AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY WHEN WE

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.016
WERE GROWING THE CROPS AND THE

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:03.485
FOOD THAT OUR STATE AND QUITE

01:22:03.551 --> 01:22:04.352
FRANKLY THE COUNTRY IN THE

01:22:04.419 --> 01:22:06.521
WORLD CONSUME. WHEN WE GO OFF

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.957
OF THE CHEAPEST FORM OF YOU

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.826
KNOW FUEL INTO ANOTHER FORM OF

01:22:11.893 --> 01:22:14.429
TECHNOLOGY. IF THAT. HAS BECOME.

01:22:14.496 --> 01:22:16.164
A FINE FEASIBLE AND WE'RE NOT

01:22:16.231 --> 01:22:18.166
THERE YET. IT DOES ONE THING TO

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:19.534
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT DRIVES UP

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:21.436
OUR COST OF LIVING. AS I THINK

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:23.138
AS E HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:24.472
I MIGHT COURAGE MEANT IS THAT

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:26.308
WE KEEP THIS IN MIND. BECAUSE

01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:27.642
I'M NOT SURE AND THIS IS MORE

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:28.843
OF A STATEMENT I WOULD LOVE

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:29.711
YOUR I MEAN THIS PART IS THE

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:31.146
QUESTION. DOES THE

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.080
ADMINISTRATION- HAVE AN

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:33.982
APPETITE. FOR IT AND ALL THE

01:22:34.049 --> 01:22:35.684
ABOVE TYPE OF APPROACH.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.352
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.753
GOALS OUT THERE THAT WE WANT TO

01:22:38.820 --> 01:22:40.455
MEET. BUT DECIMATING THE FOSSIL

01:22:40.522 --> 01:22:42.257
FUEL COMMUNITY MAY NOT IN ITS

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.792
ENTIRETY MAY NOT BE A GREAT

01:22:43.858 --> 01:22:45.293
OPTION EITHER. SO DOES THE

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.363
ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN APPETITE

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:48.963
FOR AND ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.066
OF APPROACH. WELL FROM MY

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:53.368
PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW STATE LAW

01:22:53.435 --> 01:22:55.603
IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED. TO

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.439
REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.741
EMISSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT- BY

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:02.544
MID CENTURY. AND I THINK. THE

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:04.779
GOVERNOR'S ALSO EMBRACED- THIS

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:06.314
TARGET OF CLIMATE NEUTRALITY IN

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:09.217
THAT TIME. BOB AND SO WHEN WE

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:10.585
TALK ABOUT TRANSITION WE

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:13.788
RECOGNIZE THAT- NON POSSIBLE-

01:23:13.855 --> 01:23:15.390
FUEL FORMS OF ENERGY ARE

01:23:15.457 --> 01:23:16.925
BECOMING CHEAPER THERE ARE

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.960
EXPANDING CHOICES AND THAT'S A

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:20.428
GOOD THING FOR OUR CLIMATE

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:23.031
GOALS. AT THE SAME TIME WHAT I

01:23:23.098 --> 01:23:24.699
WANT TO BE CLEAR ON IS THAT WE

01:23:24.766 --> 01:23:28.336
RECOGNIZE THAT TRANSITION. IF

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.138
APPROACHED IN A IN A NON

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.439
THOUGHTFUL WAY COULD HAVE

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:33.975
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:35.877
PART OF OUR GOALS ARE OF COURSE

01:23:35.944 --> 01:23:36.845
YEAH AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.880
CENTRAL VALLEY IS TO ENSURE THE

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:40.482
CONTINUED ECONOMIC BY A TAB

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.217
VITALITY OF COMMUNITIES. SO WE

01:23:42.283 --> 01:23:44.252
NEED TO DO BOTH. WE NEED TO

01:23:44.319 --> 01:23:45.453
TRANSIT TRANSITION TO A LOW

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.855
CARBON AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW

01:23:46.921 --> 01:23:50.191
CARBON ECONOMY BUT IN A MANNER

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:51.893
ARE PARTS OF OUR STATE BEHIND.

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:53.395
AND THAT'S COMPLICATED AND WE

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:54.796
DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS NOW

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.030
BUT I THINK IT'S AN EVOLVING

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:58.633
DIALOGUE- WILL HAVE. HERE IN

01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.934
THE COMING FEW YEARS AROUND

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:02.937
WHAT WHAT- WHAT POLICIES ARE

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.439
NEEDED TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.474
THROUGH ON AT TOWARD THESE

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:07.942

OUR REGULATORS TO ADDRESS ANY

02:04:51.650 --> 02:04:55.154
ISSUES- IN OUR THERMAL DATA MY

02:04:55.221 --> 02:04:57.723
FIELDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:59.058
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK TO

02:04:59.124 --> 02:05:01.160
ALL OF YOU- BECAUSE MR STERN

02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:02.428
AND I ARE TAG TEAMING THIS WHAT

02:05:02.494 --> 02:05:03.996
WE'RE GONNA DO NOW. IS WE'RE

02:05:04.063 --> 02:05:05.631
GOING TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS FOR

02:05:05.698 --> 02:05:06.999
THE AGENCY MEMBERS AND THEN

02:05:07.066 --> 02:05:08.667
WE'RE GOING TO ASK MR LOOK KOBE

02:05:08.734 --> 02:05:09.969
SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL

02:05:10.035 --> 02:05:11.403
MOVE ON TO MY COLLEAGUES AND

02:05:11.470 --> 02:05:14.039
LET THEM ASK QUESTIONS- SO I

02:05:14.106 --> 02:05:16.008
HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE

02:05:16.075 --> 02:05:17.576
AGENCY MEMBERS AND I'LL LEAVE

02:05:17.643 --> 02:05:19.478
IT TO YOU. AS TO WHO ANSWERS I

02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.046
THINK I THINK ONE OF THE LEAST

02:05:21.113 --> 02:05:23.249
SPECIFIC TO MR COLUMN. OF FIRST

02:05:23.315 --> 02:05:24.550
HOW MANY WELLS IN CALIFORNIA

02:05:24.617 --> 02:05:26.452
YOU ARE ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT

02:05:26.518 --> 02:05:28.187
ARE USING HIGH PRESSURE STEAM

02:05:28.254 --> 02:05:28.921
TO BREAK UP OIL FORMATIONS

02:05:28.988 --> 02:05:30.956
BELOW THE GROUND. AND COMMUTERS

02:05:31.023 --> 02:05:32.825
ARE CLARIFY ALSO THE DIFFERENCE

02:05:32.892 --> 02:05:35.227
BETWEEN THE BREAKING THE OIL

02:05:35.294 --> 02:05:37.463
FORMATIONS WITH HIGH PRESSURE

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:38.063
STEAM DIFFERENT FROM HYDRAULIC

02:05:38.130 --> 02:05:40.266
FRACKING. AND SHOULD OPERATORS

02:05:40.332 --> 02:05:43.869
BE REQUIRED TO ALSO COMPLY WITH

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:45.437
WELL STIMULATION REQUIREMENTS.

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:47.473
THAT'S THE FIRST CLASS ONE

02:05:47.539 --> 02:05:48.240
QUESTION. RABBITS THREE

02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:50.309
QUESTIONS UP IN ONE QUESTION.

02:05:50.376 --> 02:05:53.946
RIGHT SO LET ME. THE IS A- GOOD

02:05:54.013 --> 02:05:56.382
WALK TO A INTO THE BUT THE

02:05:56.448 --> 02:05:58.817
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A DRUG

02:05:58.884 --> 02:06:01.153
FRACTURING CYCLIC STEAM. UP SO

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:06.191
THIS IS. THERE BOTH. YOU MIGHT

02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.393
CONSIDER ENHANCE COVER

02:06:07.459 --> 02:06:10.562
STIMULATE TECHNI WITH.

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:12.298
HYDRAULIC FOR YOU HAVE HYPER.

02:06:12.364 --> 02:06:14.300
OR PROP OR SEEN. THAT'S

02:06:14.366 --> 02:06:15.801
INJECTED INTO A WELL BOARD I

02:06:15.868 --> 02:06:18.370
ITS PURPOSE CREATING NEW FLOW

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:20.739
CHAIR INTO THE- USUALLY IT'S

02:06:20.806 --> 02:06:23.008
FOR- ROCK DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:06:23.075 --> 02:06:24.777
PROBABILITY OR THE ABILITY FOR

02:06:24.843 --> 02:06:26.879
FLUID TO FLOW THROUGH IT THERE

02:06:26.946 --> 02:06:28.747
IS SOME OF THE DIANA MIGHT-

02:06:28.814 --> 02:06:30.316
GEOLOGY OUT THERE IF YOU

02:06:30.382 --> 02:06:31.817
DRILLED A WELL LIKED. TO DEAL

02:06:31.884 --> 02:06:32.651
WATER WELL YOU COULD DRILL IN

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:33.919
THE WATER WOULD COME OUT

02:06:33.986 --> 02:06:35.087
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:36.388
ABILITY FOR THE FLU THE FLOW

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:39.491
WITHOUT. A CRACK IN THE ROCK-

02:06:39.558 --> 02:06:40.392
HIGH PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAMER

02:06:40.459 --> 02:06:42.328
CYCLIC STEAM HAVE A SHOW DOES

02:06:42.394 --> 02:06:43.629
NOT HAVE ANY PROP INTO THE

02:06:43.696 --> 02:06:46.065
HONEY. KIM IN IT IT A STEAM SO

02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:49.668
IT'S VAPORIZED WA THAT GOES IN

02:06:49.735 --> 02:06:52.905
THE GROUND A IT CREATES IT

02:06:52.972 --> 02:06:55.874
HEATS. THE FOR MAKE. AND SO

02:06:55.941 --> 02:06:57.176
IT'S A IT'S A STIMULATION

02:06:57.242 --> 02:07:00.446
TECHNIQUE OF HE MIGHT THINK OF

02:07:00.512 --> 02:07:03.582
CHANGING. IT'S CALLED THE SCOTT

02:07:03.649 --> 02:07:06.885
CITY MOLASSE TO. THE WAY THE

02:07:06.952 --> 02:07:09.455
FOR THE BILL OF MOLASSE TO FLOW.

02:07:09.521 --> 02:07:11.190
ARE HONEY TO FLOW VERY SLOW BUT

02:07:11.256 --> 02:07:14.193
HE'D UP IT CHANGE BUT SCOTT

02:07:14.259 --> 02:07:16.695
HERE IN A GOES DOWN. IN CAN

02:07:16.762 --> 02:07:18.430
FLOW MORE LIKE WATER THE SO

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:20.833
ACTUALLY THE- NOW IT NOT IT A

02:07:20.899 --> 02:07:24.636
GOOD THROUGH JOB JUST TO WALK

02:07:24.703 --> 02:07:26.171
GOES INTO A SPONGE. THE STATE

02:07:26.238 --> 02:07:29.875
GOING TO A AND THE POOR. AND

02:07:29.942 --> 02:07:33.545
THE SUBS INTERVAL AND HELLO

02:07:33.612 --> 02:07:35.981
HOUSE FOR THE FOOD HELLO TO THE

02:07:36.048 --> 02:07:41.120
WOBBLE. IT'S A TO THE AMICK

02:07:41.186 --> 02:07:44.089
PROCESS CHANGE SECONDS. THAT

02:07:44.156 --> 02:07:55.401
FORMATION PER. A HEATER FOR

02:07:55.467 --> 02:07:57.803
HOTTER FOR THE HYDROCARBONS THE

02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:00.105
FLOW TO THE WELL BORE- IN THREE

02:08:00.172 --> 02:08:02.708
OF THE SO IT'S- IT'S IT IS.

02:08:02.775 --> 02:08:03.609
MANY WITH FUNDAMENTALLY

02:08:03.675 --> 02:08:05.511
DIFFERENT PROCESS IT IS NOT

02:08:05.577 --> 02:08:07.513
COVERED UNDER ITS BEFORE AS A-

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:10.149
WELL STIMULATION TECHNIQUE- IT

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:12.184
IT'S NOT REGULATED THAT WAY DO

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:14.553
YOU HAVE TO KEEP. INJECTING THE

02:08:14.620 --> 02:08:16.255
STEAM TO CONTINUE THAT PROCESS

02:08:16.321 --> 02:08:17.256
ORDERS IT CAN THERE IS A

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:19.024
CONTINUE BY ITSELF NATURALLY

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:20.926
ONCE THE STIMULATION HAPPENS.

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:23.028
IT SO IT THE SO THE CYCLIC

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:25.064
STEAM SOMETIME CALL HUFF AND

02:08:25.130 --> 02:08:30.035
PUFF- HAS THE PART PARTS TO A

02:08:30.102 --> 02:08:30.702
IF YOU DIDN'T THE STEAM IN

02:08:30.769 --> 02:08:32.671
THEIR YOU. HAVE NATURAL TO FLOW

02:08:32.738 --> 02:08:35.641
BACK INTO THE WHILE- IN IT WAS

02:08:35.707 --> 02:08:36.642
A NATURAL ENERGY THERE'S NO

02:08:36.708 --> 02:08:38.877
PUMP THERE'S NO SECTION- IT

02:08:38.944 --> 02:08:40.379
JUST YOU OPEN THE VALVE THE TOP

02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:42.548
OF THE FOOD COMES OUT. AND SO

02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:43.849
IN SOME WAYS IF YOU DIDN'T PUT

02:08:43.916 --> 02:08:44.783
THE STEVEN THERE IT WOULDN'T

02:08:44.850 --> 02:08:46.385
REACT THAT WAY I WOULD ONE DAY

02:08:46.452 --> 02:08:48.187
IN THE CURRENT IN. THIS HOW

02:08:48.253 --> 02:08:50.722
LONG HAVE HOPE I'M WONDERING IF

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:53.258
IT CHANGES THE ABILITY FOR THE-

02:08:53.325 --> 02:08:54.927
MATERIAL TO SORT OF WANT TO

02:08:54.993 --> 02:08:57.930
REACH THE SURFACE PERMANENTLY

02:08:57.996 --> 02:09:00.599
OR FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME.

02:09:00.666 --> 02:09:02.768
I'M NOT IN A- YEAH NOT AN OIL

02:09:02.835 --> 02:09:06.405
ENGINEERS YOU HAVE TO. KNOW I.

02:09:06.472 --> 02:09:07.606
MEAN IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION

02:09:07.673 --> 02:09:10.175
I NOT HEARD. BEFORE OF THE

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:11.143
ABOUT THAT WAY BUT IT. I MEAN

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:14.213
THAT YOU PUT. HAVE US. ISSUES

02:09:14.279 --> 02:09:16.148
THAT IF THE POOR SPACES NOT. A

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:17.683
REFILL THAT YOU'RE CREATING

02:09:17.749 --> 02:09:20.018
VOIDS ARE EMPTY SPACE THAT CAN.

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.320
WITH THAT THE OVER. OF THE

02:09:21.386 --> 02:09:22.688
PRESS OF THE CROWN ABOVE IT.

02:09:22.754 --> 02:09:25.791
SLOUGHED NOT AS PA THAT'S ONE

02:09:25.858 --> 02:09:26.625
OF THE REASONS WHEN THE

02:09:26.692 --> 02:09:28.393
QUESTION CAME UP LIKE WHY NOT

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:31.730
LOW PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAM.

02:09:31.797 --> 02:09:32.364
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TO THESE WHEN

02:09:32.431 --> 02:09:34.666
HE TO PROTECT. OF THEIR- HOW.

02:09:34.733 --> 02:09:35.634
IN A RELATIVE HOT

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:37.069
41005100 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. A

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:39.304
TEMPERATURES THE SUBSURFACE.

02:09:39.371 --> 02:09:43.876
THEY TAKE DECADES- TO COOL DOWN

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:45.611
AND SO. MUCH OF THE RESERVOIRS

02:09:45.677 --> 02:09:47.579
ALREADY HOT AND SO IF YOU JUST

02:09:47.646 --> 02:09:49.214
STOPPED. EVERYTHING WHOLESALE

02:09:49.281 --> 02:09:50.782
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. TRIGGER

02:09:50.849 --> 02:09:52.284
POTENTIALLY SERVICE

02:09:52.351 --> 02:09:53.986
EXPRESSIONS- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:55.220
SUBSIDENCE OF CRACKS AT THE

02:09:55.287 --> 02:09:58.223
SURFACE- AREAS- THAT WOULD

02:09:58.290 --> 02:10:01.160
CONCAVE AND- IT. IT IT IT IT

02:10:01.226 --> 02:10:03.996
WOULD BE WAS CALLED BAD

02:10:04.062 --> 02:10:04.796
RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT. CRAYONS

02:10:04.863 --> 02:10:07.366
CONDITIONS. POTENTIAL TRIGGER

02:10:07.432 --> 02:10:08.834
ADDITIONAL SIR. PRESS THAT WE

02:10:08.901 --> 02:10:11.703
DON'T TO DO. SO PER. IS INTENSE

02:10:11.770 --> 02:10:20.646
ENOUGH THAT IT IS CHANGE. THE

02:10:20.712 --> 02:10:22.781
LOCAL MAKE. UP OF THE FORMATION

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:25.384
BELOW. FOR DE. IT THROUGH THE

02:10:25.450 --> 02:10:27.219
HE IN. AND THEN THE FLU MOVE.

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:30.222
SO FLUID AND BUT IT'S A- SOME

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:32.491
LIKE ALL MACHINE. THAT YOU KNOW

02:10:32.558 --> 02:10:33.225
YOU EVERY TIME YOU INJECT THE

02:10:33.292 --> 02:10:34.660
STEAM THE GROUND IT GOES A

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:36.028
DIFFERENT FLOW IN. DIFFER PART

02:10:36.094 --> 02:10:37.229
OF THE JOB IS NOT A YOU.

02:10:37.296 --> 02:10:39.598
ADJUSTER AND- OF FINGERING OR

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:41.066
DIRECT. SO EVERY TIME YOU DO IT

02:10:41.133 --> 02:10:43.101
YOU YOU YOU STEAM HIT THE PART

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:45.137
OF THE UNDERGROUND. AND SO IT'S

02:10:45.204 --> 02:10:48.473
THIS ENTERED OF PROCESS- BUT IT

02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:49.808
IT IT CHANGES BY THE NATURE THE

02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:51.276
FLUID COMING OUT GROUND IS THE

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:53.512
IS THE PHYSICAL CHANGE. FOR ME

02:10:53.579 --> 02:10:55.514
AS THE SOME OTHER RECENTLY.

02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.082
MADE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS HE

02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:58.317
LEGAL HOW MANY SERVICE

02:10:58.383 --> 02:11:00.018
EXPRESSIONS OF WE HAVE. FROM

02:11:00.085 --> 02:11:03.922
THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND

02:11:03.989 --> 02:11:05.724
NINETEEN TELL NOW. TWO

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:08.727
THOUSAND. TRY NOW. I THINK I

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:27.145
HAVE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE ONE

02:11:27.212 --> 02:11:32.884
Y. THERE'S A SERVER CLUSTER.

RISKS THAT DON'T EXIST BUT- THE

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:54.265
FACT IS IN THIS CASE WE GOT A

02:27:54.332 --> 02:27:55.900
LITTLE BIT LUCKY. RIGHT WE

PROFESSIONAL GASSED IN THIS AT

02:33:47.184 --> 02:33:48.352

02:36:11.495 --> 02:36:13.797
STEAMING- ALSO THOUGH AT THE

02:36:13.864 --> 02:36:15.332

WERE LATE THE- THE SEAT TO- AT

02:36:48.265 --> 02:36:49.700
SOME POINT IN TIME IT WOULD

02:36:49.767 --> 02:36:51.635
HAVE BEEN ON CYCLIC STEAM.

02:36:51.702 --> 02:36:52.402
RIGHT SO I GUESS THE BIG

02:36:52.469 --> 02:36:53.871
QUESTION THAT STILL HAS TO BE

02:36:53.937 --> 02:36:55.472
ANSWERED IS HOW MUCH DID THE

02:36:55.539 --> 02:36:57.508
HIGH PRESSURE STEAM CONTRIBUTE.

02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:58.642
TO THE SERVICE EXPRESSION AND

02:36:58.709 --> 02:36:59.543
THAT'S STILL UNDER

02:36:59.610 --> 02:37:01.245
INVESTIGATION THAT STILL WHAT

02:37:01.311 --> 02:37:02.713
WE'RE LOOKING INTO CORRECT AND

02:37:02.780 --> 02:37:04.181
WORKING WITH AGENCIES ON THAT

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:06.950
PARTICULAR- TOPIC. DOES THE

02:37:07.017 --> 02:37:08.685
STEAMER YOU INJECT HAVE ANY

02:37:08.752 --> 02:37:10.220
CHEMICAL ADDITIVES OR IS IT

02:37:10.287 --> 02:37:12.589
JUST STEAM. NO TYPICALLY THE

02:37:12.656 --> 02:37:14.091
STAIN THAT WE'RE GOING TO PREP

02:37:14.158 --> 02:37:16.226
TO INJECT- YOU NEED PURIFIED

02:37:16.293 --> 02:37:18.128
WATER IF IT'S NOT PURIFIED AND

02:37:18.195 --> 02:37:19.329
AT THAT POINT IF FORM SCALES

02:37:19.396 --> 02:37:20.464
AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO IT'S

02:37:20.531 --> 02:37:21.832
TYPICALLY PURE WATER THAT WERE

02:37:21.899 --> 02:37:24.201
FORMED A STEAM WITH- AND THEN

02:37:24.268 --> 02:37:25.369
MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU SEE

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:28.272
HOW EASY. MY LAST QUESTION IS-

02:37:28.338 --> 02:37:29.573
I WAS JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:31.208
MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE

02:37:31.275 --> 02:37:32.442
CURRENTLY APPEALING THE

02:37:32.509 --> 02:37:34.311
PENALTIES THE CIVIL PENALTIES

02:37:34.378 --> 02:37:36.613
AND I'M JUST WONDERING- GIVEN

02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:39.183

RESPONSIBILITY. ON WHAT GROUNDS

02:37:41.718 --> 02:37:43.787
ARE YOU APPEALING AND ALTES SO

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:47.891
THERE'S- A COUPLE OF THINGS

02:37:47.958 --> 02:37:48.926
FOR ONE THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE

02:37:48.992 --> 02:37:51.094
HAVE- I'M TWO. GUS YOU KNOW

02:37:51.161 --> 02:37:54.464
WHAT. IN THE ORDER IS VERY

02:37:54.531 --> 02:37:57.935
LIMITED SO IF YOU WANTED TO US

02:37:58.001 --> 02:38:00.804
THAT. AND I THINK THE TEN DAYS

02:38:00.871 --> 02:38:01.805
YOU HAVE RISK. AT THAT POINT

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:02.606
YOU HAVE TO APPEAL. TO OUR

02:38:02.673 --> 02:38:03.841
LEGAL WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE THEM

02:38:03.907 --> 02:38:05.709
CONCERN WITH- IS THE WAY THE

02:38:05.776 --> 02:38:07.177
ART OF WAS WRITTEN THAT IT SAID

02:38:07.244 --> 02:38:09.847
THAT WE HAD- PRESENTED AND I'M

02:38:09.913 --> 02:38:11.682
GONNA PAIR FACE HERE-

02:38:11.748 --> 02:38:14.685
SIGNIFICANT- THREAT. TO HUMAN

02:38:14.751 --> 02:38:16.753
HEALTH OR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:18.055
SO IT'S NOT THE FINANCIAL

02:38:18.121 --> 02:38:20.591
AMOUNT THEN THAT IS UNDER- YOU

02:38:20.657 --> 02:38:22.226
KNOW DISPUTE ON YOUR MIND IT'S

02:38:22.292 --> 02:38:24.127
MORE OF THE FINDINGS OUR

02:38:24.194 --> 02:38:25.529
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE WAY THAT

02:38:25.596 --> 02:38:27.731
IS WRITTEN. AND AGAIN I WANT TO

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:29.333
TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL

02:38:29.399 --> 02:38:30.734
TO POINT OUT EVEN THOUGH WE

02:38:30.801 --> 02:38:32.336
APPEALED AT NO POINT THAT WE

02:38:32.402 --> 02:38:33.837
STOP WORKING YOU KNOW IN

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:35.906
CONJUNCTION WITH THE AGENCIES.

02:38:35.973 --> 02:38:37.174
YOU KNOW FOR THE RESPONSE FOR

02:38:37.241 --> 02:38:39.676
THE CLEAN UP AND TO STOP GS

02:38:39.743 --> 02:38:40.844
FIVE YEAH I WAS JUST I'M

02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:43.513
CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THERE

02:38:43.580 --> 02:38:45.282
IS A CIVIL PENALTY AND IT'S IT.

02:38:45.349 --> 02:38:47.451
IT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE APPEAL

02:38:47.517 --> 02:38:49.887
WAS ABOUT THE CIVIL PENALTY-

02:38:49.953 --> 02:38:51.255
AND BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S MORE

02:38:51.321 --> 02:38:53.624
ABOUT THE- THE FINDINGS ABOUT

02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:56.526
THE- THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC WORLD

02:38:56.593 --> 02:38:57.427
AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:59.329
LATER ON AND- THAT MAKES SENSE.

02:38:59.396 --> 02:39:01.565
TO ME. A YOU WERE ABLE TO SELL

02:39:01.632 --> 02:39:04.635
OIL THAT WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE

02:39:04.701 --> 02:39:07.004
SPILL CORRECT. SO THE ACTUAL.

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:09.373
AT ONE WHY- THE WAY WE PROCESS

02:39:09.439 --> 02:39:11.708
THAT OIL THAT WAS REMOVED-

02:39:11.775 --> 02:39:13.343
THERE FROM THE DRY STREAMBED IS

02:39:13.410 --> 02:39:14.878
IT EVENTUALLY MADE IT THROUGH

02:39:14.945 --> 02:39:17.114
OUR PROCESS FACILITY. RIGHT AND

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:19.616
IS THAT- AMOUNT OF. PROFIT OR

02:39:19.683 --> 02:39:21.952
REVENUE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN

02:39:22.019 --> 02:39:24.254
THE PENALTIES ARE ASSESSED. I

02:39:24.321 --> 02:39:25.822
DON'T KNOW HOW WAS ASSESSED I

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:27.324
CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I CAN TELL

02:39:27.391 --> 02:39:29.426
YOU THAT WE SPENT- MORE THAN

02:39:29.493 --> 02:39:30.761
NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS

02:39:30.827 --> 02:39:32.963
SO FAR AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK

02:39:33.030 --> 02:39:34.064
AT THE REVENUE THAT WOULD BE

02:39:34.131 --> 02:39:39.903
GENERATED- BY THINK IT'S SIXTY-

02:39:39.970 --> 02:39:40.437
SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED

02:39:40.504 --> 02:39:41.405
BARRELS THAT WAS ASSOCIATED

02:39:41.471 --> 02:39:43.373
THEIR OF OIL. WE TAKE A LOOK

02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:44.741
THE REVENUE THAT'S ASSOCIATED

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:45.842
WITH THAT IT PALES IN

02:39:45.909 --> 02:39:46.810
COMPARISON TO THE NINE POINT

02:39:46.877 --> 02:39:47.911
TWO MILLION WE SPENT ON THE

02:39:47.978 --> 02:39:49.613
RESPONSE I'M DEFINITELY NOT

EXPRESSION DON'T GET ME WRONG.

02:39:53.717 --> 02:39:55.252
I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT I'M JUST

02:39:55.319 --> 02:39:56.687
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

02:39:56.753 --> 02:39:58.155
BIT ABOUT THE SO THE NEXUS

02:39:58.221 --> 02:39:59.389
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE

02:39:59.456 --> 02:40:05.829
PENALTY AND- A KIND OF- FUTURE-

02:40:05.896 --> 02:40:08.065
JUST YOU KNOW. OF

02:40:08.131 --> 02:40:09.433
DISCOURAGEMENT FOR YOU KNOW

OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE

02:40:13.503 --> 02:40:15.339
PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT WERE.

02:40:15.405 --> 02:40:17.007
GLAD THAT IT HAPPENED IN THIS

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:18.742
PARTICULAR LOCATION IS THAT IT

02:40:18.809 --> 02:40:20.344
WAS CHEVRON TO AN OPERATOR THAT

02:40:20.410 --> 02:40:21.778
HAS THE WHERE WITH ALL IN THE

ABILITY TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB

02:40:23.413 --> 02:40:24.815
WITH CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP

02:40:24.881 --> 02:40:27.484
SO. I'M NOT AT ALL- DISPUTING

ADMINISTRATION. REGARDING WELL

02:40:38.095 --> 02:40:40.364
REMAIN IN MINT VERSES- SIR

02:40:40.430 --> 02:40:41.999
GEOLOGICAL INTEGRITY SO YOU'RE

02:40:42.065 --> 02:40:43.400
SAYING YOU THINK IT'S AT THIS

02:40:43.467 --> 02:40:45.302
POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO WELL RE

ABANDONMENT BUT- EXPLAIN IS WHY

02:40:47.637 --> 02:40:50.774
YOU DON'T THINK. THAT THE

02:40:50.841 --> 02:40:53.944
SERVICE EXPRESSION WOULD LEAD

02:40:54.011 --> 02:40:55.212
TO A LOSS OF SAY GEOLOGIC

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:56.780
INTEGRITY FOR THE FIELD OVERALL

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:59.049
LIKE WHAT WHAT GIVES YOU SO IN

02:40:59.116 --> 02:41:01.018
THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE- WE

02:41:01.084 --> 02:41:02.786
BELIEVE THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU

02:41:02.853 --> 02:41:04.488
KNOW IT WAS THE RE ABANDONMENT

02:41:04.554 --> 02:41:06.990
THAT- THERE WAS A COMPROMISE

02:41:07.057 --> 02:41:08.091
PORTION OF THE WELL BORE THAT

02:41:08.158 --> 02:41:09.192
WE WERE WORKING ON WITH THE RE

02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:10.727
ABANDONMENT AND THAT CREATED A

02:41:10.794 --> 02:41:12.896
PATHWAY TO THE SURFACE THAT IN

02:41:12.963 --> 02:41:13.797
THE COMING OUT IN THE DRY

02:41:13.864 --> 02:41:16.066
STREAMBED. DUE TO ITS VICINITY

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:16.733
TO THE SURFACE IT'S M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u>

02:41:16.800 --> 02:41:18.769
SHALLOW AND WHICH IS KIND OF

02:41:18.835 --> 02:41:19.903
THE PATH OF REACH LEASE

02:41:19.970 --> 02:41:23.473
RESISTANCE- YOU REFER TO YOU

02:41:23.540 --> 02:41:25.208
KNOW THE ENTIRE FIELD- AND

02:41:25.275 --> 02:41:27.377
AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE VERY

02:41:27.444 --> 02:41:29.746
SMALL PINPOINTED PORTION OF THE

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:32.182
FIELD- MATTER OF FACT WHEN YOU

02:41:32.249 --> 02:41:33.383
TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES

02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:35.085
THAT WERE SHOWN EARLIER- BE

02:41:35.152 --> 02:41:37.220
IMPACTED SOIL IS ABOUT ONE ACRE

02:41:37.287 --> 02:41:40.490
IN- IN A FIELD THAT IS TWENTY

02:41:40.557 --> 02:41:41.558
SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. SO YOU

02:41:41.625 --> 02:41:43.293
KNOW IT IT'S QUITE A BIT OF

02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.828
DIFFERENCE THERE AS FAR AS WHEN

02:41:44.895 --> 02:41:45.829
YOU LOOK AT THIS ONE EVENT

02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:47.097
COMPARED TO THE SCALE OF THE

02:41:47.164 --> 02:41:49.433
ENTIRE FIELD. AND SO WHEN

02:41:49.499 --> 02:41:51.101
YOU'RE SAYING ONE EVENT IT'S

02:41:51.168 --> 02:41:52.969
THE IT'S THE EVENT I GUESS ITS

02:41:53.036 --> 02:41:55.138
REPORT NINETEEN THIRTY FORTY

02:41:55.205 --> 02:41:56.640
ACCORDING THAT TIME LINE AS THE

02:41:56.706 --> 02:41:58.141
MATE WHEN IT WAS REPORT ON MAY

02:41:58.208 --> 02:42:00.310
TENTH YET THAT'S CORRECT. AND

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:05.582
THEN SO THE OTHER REPORT THOUGH

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:08.418
ON JUNE EIGHTH THERE WAS THE-

02:42:08.485 --> 02:42:12.122
RE. ON EIGHTEENTH IN ADDITIONAL

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:13.523
EVENT REPORT ON JUNE TWENTY

02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:16.793
THIRD- USING THAT'S ON IN YOUR

02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:18.829
ESTIMATION UNRELATED TO THE TO

02:42:18.895 --> 02:42:19.963
THE MAIN EVENT WE BELIEVE THAT

02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.997
THEY'RE ALL RELATED THAT

02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:22.399
THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO. A AT

02:42:22.466 --> 02:42:25.902
THE SIMILAR SEAT- INITIATION IF

02:42:25.969 --> 02:42:26.903
YOU WILL IT'S JUST DIFFERENT

02:42:26.970 --> 02:42:28.839
FLOW LOCATIONS THAT THEY ARE

02:42:28.905 --> 02:42:32.109
FLOWING OUT OF. BUT THE LET'S

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:33.543
CALL THE JUNE EVENT FOR LACK OF

02:42:33.610 --> 02:42:35.912
A BETTER TERM IT'S NINETEEN

02:42:35.979 --> 02:42:37.481
THREE SIX SIX EIGHT BUT- THAT.

02:42:37.547 --> 02:42:38.782
YOU'RE TREATING THAT TO WILL RE

02:42:38.849 --> 02:42:41.451
ABANDONMENT AS WELL CORRECT SO

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:43.186
ONCE AGAIN AS THAT PATH STARTED

02:42:43.253 --> 02:42:45.455
MIGRATING UP TO THE SURFACE WE

02:42:45.522 --> 02:42:46.723
BELIEVE THAT IT BRANCHED OFF

02:42:46.790 --> 02:42:48.492
INTO SOME OTHER AREAS THAT IT

02:42:48.558 --> 02:42:50.293
CAN'T MOVING TO POINTS OF LEAST

02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.728
RESISTANCE. BECAUSE THE

02:42:51.795 --> 02:42:53.163
ORIGINAL FLOW SITE A RECENT

02:42:53.230 --> 02:42:55.132
POINT WERE EQUIPPED FLOWING AND

02:42:55.198 --> 02:42:56.466
THEN YOU HAD OTHER FLOW SITES

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:58.168
THAT HAD STARTED. SO WE THINK

02:42:58.235 --> 02:43:00.137
THE FLOW ITSELF WAS STILL ABOUT

02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:02.038
THE SAME IS JUST COMING OUT OF

02:43:02.105 --> 02:43:04.341
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. SO WE'RE

02:43:04.407 --> 02:43:05.775
LOOKING FOR IT I MEAN DO YOU

02:43:05.842 --> 02:43:07.711
ANTICIPATE THE NEED TO DO

02:43:07.777 --> 02:43:09.679
CONTINUOUS FLUID INJECTION OF

02:43:09.746 --> 02:43:11.014
SOME SORT REGARDLESS OF THE

02:43:11.081 --> 02:43:12.382
EFFORTS TO COOL THE FIELD OFF

02:43:12.449 --> 02:43:13.984
RIGHT NOW BUT IN TOWARD IN. IN

02:43:14.050 --> 02:43:15.719
ORDER MAINTAIN SOME GEOLOGIC

02:43:15.785 --> 02:43:17.420
INTEGRITY TO THIS THERMAL DATA

02:43:17.487 --> 02:43:18.522
MIGHT DO YOU THINK THERE'S

02:43:18.588 --> 02:43:21.124
GOING TO HAVE TO BE A SORT OF.

02:43:21.191 --> 02:43:23.760
CONTINUOUS EFFORT FOR. FLOODING

02:43:23.827 --> 02:43:26.763
STEAMING SOME KIND OF- SOME

02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:28.331
KIND OF ON GOING WORK NO THAT'S

02:43:28.398 --> 02:43:29.799
A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THE

02:43:29.866 --> 02:43:31.735
PRIMARY GOAL IS GOING TO BE THE

02:43:31.801 --> 02:43:33.370
JUST A MASS BALANCE OF WHATEVER

02:43:33.436 --> 02:43:34.804
IT IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING OUT

02:43:34.871 --> 02:43:36.173
YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT IN

02:43:36.239 --> 02:43:39.209
THEIR- SO. AGAIN IF YOU'RE

02:43:39.276 --> 02:43:41.678
GOING TO EXTRACT- OIL AND

02:43:41.745 --> 02:43:43.113
RESERVOIR FLEW IT THEN IT'S

02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:44.681
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE THERE TO

02:43:44.748 --> 02:43:45.749
REPLACE IT WHEN YOU'RE DOING

02:43:45.815 --> 02:43:48.251
THE- CYCLIC STEAMING- YOU HAVE

02:43:48.318 --> 02:43:49.319
THE STEAM THAT'S GOING AND

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:50.754
THEY'RE COLLECTING AND

02:43:50.820 --> 02:43:51.555
REPLACING THE FLUIDS THAT

02:43:51.621 --> 02:43:53.223
YOU'RE REMOVING. IF YOU GET TO

02:43:53.290 --> 02:43:54.724
A POINT WHERE YOU SAY I DON'T

02:43:54.791 --> 02:43:56.326
WANT TO STEAM ANYMORE AND

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:57.460
YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO COOL THE

02:43:57.527 --> 02:43:58.662
RESERVOIR OFF LIKE WE'RE DOING

02:43:58.728 --> 02:44:00.096
NOW. BEEN IN THAT POINT WERE

02:44:00.163 --> 02:44:02.766
INTRODUCING WATER- TO MAKE SURE

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:04.834
THAT WERE BALANCING THAT. WE

02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:06.069
ARE MONITORING TO FEEL VERY

02:44:06.136 --> 02:44:07.971
CAREFULLY FOR ANY SORT OF

02:44:08.038 --> 02:44:09.406
GROUND MOVEMENT AND WE DO THIS

02:44:09.472 --> 02:44:10.907
WITH TILT METERS THAT ARE

02:44:10.974 --> 02:44:13.276
EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. AS WELL AS

02:44:13.343 --> 02:44:15.212
THE- SATELLITE IMAGERY

02:44:15.278 --> 02:44:17.247
TECHNOLOGY- THAT ALSO MEASURES

02:44:17.314 --> 02:44:19.149
IT ANYTIME WE SEE ANY SORT OF

02:44:19.216 --> 02:44:20.850
SUBSIDENCE THEN ONCE AGAIN WAT

02:44:20.917 --> 02:44:22.752
WE DO IS GO AND ALTER THE

02:44:22.819 --> 02:44:24.621
INJECTION RATE SO THAT WE CAN

02:44:24.688 --> 02:44:25.488
MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T

02:44:25.555 --> 02:44:27.724
GET. OUT OF HAND OR OUTSIDE OF

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:28.592
THE PARAMETERS THAT WE WOULD

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:29.926
LIKE TO KEEP IF WE START SEEING

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:32.596
UP LIVE. LIKEWISE WE MOUNTED WE

02:44:32.662 --> 02:44:34.898
START TO MODIFY THE INJECTION

02:44:34.965 --> 02:44:36.533
AND WE CAN ALSO MODIFY THE

02:44:36.600 --> 02:44:38.969
WITHDRAWAL RATE AS WELL IN CAN

02:44:39.035 --> 02:44:42.239
YOU. LACK OF FOR LAYMAN'S TERMS

02:44:42.305 --> 02:44:43.440
CAN YOU. YOU CATCH UP FAST

02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:44.975
ENOUGH IF YOUR TILT METERS ARE

02:44:45.041 --> 02:44:46.776
SAYING HEY THERE'S A PROBLEM.

02:44:46.843 --> 02:44:48.311
ARE YOU I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW

02:44:48.378 --> 02:44:49.746
ABOUT THE FEROCITY IN THE

02:44:49.813 --> 02:44:51.181
INJECTION RATES BUT I MEAN CAN

02:44:51.248 --> 02:44:52.415
YOU CATCH UP QUICKLY ENOUGH TO

02:44:52.482 --> 02:44:54.217
ACTUALLY. PREVENT MASSIVE

02:44:54.284 --> 02:44:57.787
SUBSIDENCE IN TIME- MORE. SO

02:44:57.854 --> 02:44:59.389
THE PARAMETERS THAT WE LIKE TO

02:44:59.456 --> 02:45:01.658
STAY WITHIN OR LESS THAN TWO

02:45:01.725 --> 02:45:03.727
INCHES OF SUBSIDENCE PER YEAR

02:45:03.793 --> 02:45:05.295
SO IT'S NOT A LOT OF MOVEMENT

02:45:05.362 --> 02:45:06.596
AND THESE ARE EXTREMELY

02:45:06.663 --> 02:45:08.698
SENSITIVE AND WE CAN. NOT CATCH

02:45:08.765 --> 02:45:11.334
UP BUT WE CAN- MONITOR AND

02:45:11.401 --> 02:45:13.236
MAINTAIN TO WHERE WE MINIMIZE

02:45:13.303 --> 02:45:14.804
THE GROUND MOVEMENT- THAT'S

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:17.340
VERY POSSIBLE- WE'VE HAD SOME

02:45:17.407 --> 02:45:19.509
CHALLENGES- WHEN THIS SEEPS

02:45:19.576 --> 02:45:20.910
TOOK PLACE THERE WERE STEAM

02:45:20.977 --> 02:45:22.646
BLOCKS THAT WERE PUT. AROUND

02:45:22.712 --> 02:45:25.148
THE ACTUAL STEEP SITES. THAT

02:45:25.215 --> 02:45:25.782
ARE THERE CALL WHAT STEAM

02:45:25.849 --> 02:45:28.184
BLOCKS. STEAM BUT IT'S A RADIUS

02:45:28.251 --> 02:45:29.753
AT WHICH YOU ARE NO LONGER CAN

02:45:29.819 --> 02:45:32.289
INJECT- OR OR CONDUCT THE

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:34.224
CYCLIC STEAMING OPERATIONS AT

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:35.592
ONCE AGAIN THAT PRESENTS SOME

02:45:35.659 --> 02:45:37.861
CHALLENGES THAT ON THAT MASS

02:45:37.927 --> 02:45:40.864
BALANCE. I ISN'T THAT BECAUSE

02:45:40.930 --> 02:45:42.065
OF A OF A THAT'S A G. A LOT

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:43.066
THERE'S JUST BLOCK BECAUSE OF

02:45:43.133 --> 02:45:45.135
IT. THE KARACHI ISSUE OR THE

02:45:45.201 --> 02:45:46.202
STAINED BLOCKS ARE A

02:45:46.269 --> 02:45:48.104
THEORETICAL WE WOULD LIKE TO

02:45:48.171 --> 02:45:49.773
DRAW A THEORETICAL RADIUS

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:51.374
AROUND A PARTICULAR SITE IN

02:45:51.441 --> 02:45:53.376
THIS ONE WAS THE- ACTIVE SEEPS

02:45:53.443 --> 02:45:55.245
AT THAT TIME- AND IT WAS

02:45:55.312 --> 02:45:56.946
WORKING WITH CAL JAM THAT SAID

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:58.715
HEY WE WANT AND EFFECTIVE STEAM

02:45:58.782 --> 02:46:00.583
BLOCK IN THIS AREA. IT'S NOT A

02:46:00.650 --> 02:46:01.751
WALL THAT WE BUILD A REGULAR

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.820
ROWNTREE YEAH UNDERSTOOD IT'S

02:46:03.887 --> 02:46:05.255
MORE REGULATORY NOT GEOLOGIC

02:46:05.322 --> 02:46:06.556
CORRECT. OKAY IT'S A

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:08.291
THEORETICAL BUT AND WITHIN THAT

02:46:08.358 --> 02:46:11.394
YOU CAN NO LONGER- AGAIN

02:46:11.461 --> 02:46:12.796
CONDUCT THE CYCLIC STEAMING

02:46:12.862 --> 02:46:15.265
OPERATIONS AND SO THAT LIMITS

02:46:15.332 --> 02:46:17.367
YOUR ABILITIES TO AFFECT THE

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:21.371
SUBSIDENCE  TO OFFSET THAT

02:46:21.438 --> 02:46:22.839
IN THE BACK I'M GONNA ASK I

02:46:22.906 --> 02:46:24.174
**** BEFORE BUT I'M STILL

02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:25.508
UNCLEAR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR

02:46:25.575 --> 02:46:26.943
THAT IT'S GAME BECAUSE I'M NOT

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:29.646
AN ENGINEER- HOW LONG IS THIS

02:46:29.713 --> 02:46:31.247
INSTABILITY LAST I MEAN DO YOU

02:46:31.314 --> 02:46:32.382
KNOW IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S

02:46:32.449 --> 02:46:33.750
NO MATTER WHAT AS YOU TRY TO

02:46:33.817 --> 02:46:35.251
CALL THIS FIELD ARE WE LOOKING

02:46:35.318 --> 02:46:36.319
TO TEN YEARS OF THIS TWENTY

02:46:36.386 --> 02:46:37.854
YEARS OR DO WE NOT KNOW OR ANY

02:46:37.921 --> 02:46:39.155
YEAR EVERYTHING'S FINE YOU CAN

02:46:39.222 --> 02:46:40.523
WALK AROUND THERE'S NO DANGER

02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:42.492
THERE'S NO TILTING. I MEAN HOW

02:46:42.559 --> 02:46:43.893
LONG THIS IS INSTABILITY THIS

02:46:43.960 --> 02:46:46.096
FEEL GOING TO. SELL AND BE WE

02:46:46.162 --> 02:46:47.731
ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE

02:46:47.797 --> 02:46:49.833
THE SUBSIDENCE AND THE UP LIVE

02:46:49.899 --> 02:46:51.868
TILL IT STOPS YOU KNOW UNTIL WE

02:46:51.935 --> 02:46:52.602
REACH SOME POINT I SAID HOW

02:46:52.669 --> 02:46:54.571
LONG DO WE KNOW HOW LONG

02:46:54.637 --> 02:46:56.539
THAT'S- GOING TO AND I DON'T

02:46:56.606 --> 02:46:58.975
KNOW THAT- I I'M NOT SURE. YOU

02:46:59.042 --> 02:47:01.111
KNOW EXACTLY- WHAT THAT TIME

02:47:01.177 --> 02:47:02.946
WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT ONCE AGAIN

02:47:03.012 --> 02:47:04.581
YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THE COOLING

02:47:04.647 --> 02:47:06.116
PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME

02:47:06.182 --> 02:47:08.118
TIME NOW- AND IS THIS WITH WHEN

02:47:08.184 --> 02:47:09.419
YOU SAY SOMETIMES SO IS THAT. A

02:47:09.486 --> 02:47:11.454
YEAR TEN YEARS MORE THAN A

02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:13.556
YEAR- BUT I DON'T KNOW PAST

02:47:13.623 --> 02:47:15.291
THAT POINT AND IS THIS KIND OF

02:47:15.358 --> 02:47:17.794
INSTABILITY COMMON WITH ALL OF

02:47:17.861 --> 02:47:18.661
THE FIELDS THAT YOU CYCLIC

02:47:18.728 --> 02:47:20.930
STEAMING. NO THIS IS VERY

02:47:20.997 --> 02:47:23.733
UNIQUE TO- THERMAL DATA MIGHT

02:47:23.800 --> 02:47:25.535
AND THERMAL DATA MY THAT IS

02:47:25.602 --> 02:47:26.536
NEAR THE SURFACE SO IF IT WERE

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:28.071
DEEP ENOUGH DOWN THEN YOU WOULD

02:47:28.138 --> 02:47:29.672
HAVE ENOUGH OVER BURDEN OVER

02:47:29.739 --> 02:47:31.608
THE TOP OF IT THAT THIS MAY NOT

02:47:31.674 --> 02:47:34.244
BE AN ISSUE. IF IT WERE NOT

02:47:34.310 --> 02:47:36.613
DYNAMITE- ONCE AGAIN THIS MAY

02:47:36.679 --> 02:47:37.881
NOT POSE AN ISSUE IF IT WERE

02:47:37.947 --> 02:47:42.018
MORE COMPETENT ROCK AS FOR

02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:42.585
SANDSTONE OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:46.022
THAT. IN OTHER. SO WHAT PER. OF

02:47:46.089 --> 02:47:47.257
IT WHAT. HAVE WHAT CHEVRON.

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:48.892
FALLS WITHIN THIS CATEGORY OF

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:51.895
THERMAL DYNAMITE. SO BECAUSE IT

02:47:51.961 --> 02:47:53.396
THIS IS ONLY UNIQUE TO THIS.

02:47:53.463 --> 02:47:56.299
TYPE THEN WHAT PERCENT I MEAN

02:47:56.366 --> 02:47:59.035
IS THIS- THERMAL DATA MY RIGHT

02:47:59.102 --> 02:48:00.470
NOW REPRESENTS A LITTLE OVER

02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.005
10% OF THE STATE'S CURRENT

02:48:02.071 --> 02:48:03.706
PRODUCTION WHAT ABOUT CHEVRON'S

02:48:03.773 --> 02:48:06.676
PRODUCTION- FOR US- PRIOR TO

02:48:06.743 --> 02:48:09.279
THIS IT WAS PRIOR TO THE EVENT-

02:48:09.345 --> 02:48:11.414
WE READ ABOUT TWENTY THREE

02:48:11.481 --> 02:48:13.216
THOUSAND BARRELS- OUT OF ABOUT

02:48:13.283 --> 02:48:14.851
A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND

02:48:14.918 --> 02:48:20.190
SO. REPORTER 20% OF PRODUCTION

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:21.891
YEAH LESS THAN A QUARTER YEAH

02:48:21.958 --> 02:48:27.964
BORN CORD. OKAY. THE RESUME OUT

02:48:28.031 --> 02:48:29.732
THEN FOR A SECOND OKAY I KNOW

02:48:29.799 --> 02:48:31.734
YOU OVERSEE MOSTLY SAN JOAQUIN

02:48:31.801 --> 02:48:34.204
THE BUSINESS SIDE OPERATIONS I

02:48:34.270 --> 02:48:35.238
DO APPRECIATE YOUR OPENING

02:48:35.305 --> 02:48:38.541
COMMENTS THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF

02:48:38.608 --> 02:48:42.278
REALITY CLIMATE CHANGE. EN

02:48:42.345 --> 02:48:43.746
THAT'S A BIG FIRST STEP WITH

02:48:43.813 --> 02:48:45.448
OUR OIL MAJORS ARE IT HAS BEEN

02:48:45.515 --> 02:48:49.352
UP TO THIS POINT. BUT

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:51.688
RECOGNIZING THAT RISK AND

02:48:51.754 --> 02:48:52.922
FOSSIL FUELS ROLE IN

02:48:52.989 --> 02:48:57.827
EXACERBATING THAT RISK. TRYING

02:48:57.894 --> 02:49:00.063
TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT. I THE

02:49:00.129 --> 02:49:01.698
CALIFORNIA SCALE COMMITMENTS

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:04.067
ARE OR SHOULD MORE GLOBAL

02:49:04.133 --> 02:49:06.703
COMPANY WIDE COMMITMENTS ARE IN

02:49:06.769 --> 02:49:07.737
THIS AREA I APPRECIATE SOME OF

02:49:07.804 --> 02:49:09.405
THE TURN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES

02:49:09.472 --> 02:49:10.807
RENEWABLE ENERGY WE KNOW

02:49:10.874 --> 02:49:13.309
CHEVRONS ACTUALLY VERY LARGE-

02:49:13.376 --> 02:49:15.044
ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONTRACTOR

02:49:15.111 --> 02:49:16.813
AND DOES ALL KINDS OF WORK IN

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.850
THE ENERGY SPACE BUT- COULDN'T

02:49:20.917 --> 02:49:22.619
HELP BUT BE STRUCK WHEN REP

02:49:22.685 --> 02:49:26.489
SOLD THE SPANISH OIL. MAJOR

02:49:26.556 --> 02:49:28.124
ANNOUNCED THEIR COMMITMENT TO

02:49:28.191 --> 02:49:29.692
GO CARBON NEUTRAL AS AN OIL

02:49:29.759 --> 02:49:32.195
COMPANIES CHEVRON LOOKING AT

02:49:32.262 --> 02:49:35.665
THOSE KINDS OF- COMMITMENTS

02:49:35.732 --> 02:49:38.434
THEMSELVES AND- YEAH SO WE HAVE

02:49:38.501 --> 02:49:40.803
SEVERAL- CORPORATE WIDE-

02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:42.739
COMMITMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE

02:49:42.805 --> 02:49:43.706
AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU A

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:44.807
COUPLE OF THEM IN AND I'LL GIVE

02:49:44.874 --> 02:49:45.775
YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'RE

02:49:45.842 --> 02:49:47.911
DOING WITH IN CALIFORNIA-

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:51.648
FIRST- WE HAVE- TARGETS FOR

02:49:51.714 --> 02:49:53.616
METHANE AND FLARING EMISSION

02:49:53.683 --> 02:49:55.618
REDUCTIONS AND THESE OR

02:49:55.685 --> 02:49:58.221
INTENSITY BASED. FOR METHANE WE

02:49:58.288 --> 02:50:00.857
PLAN TO REDUCE THAT FROM TWENTY

02:50:00.924 --> 02:50:02.025
TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- WHEN

02:50:02.091 --> 02:50:03.760
YOU COMPARE TWENTY SIXTEEN

02:50:03.826 --> 02:50:05.628
NUMBERS TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE

02:50:05.695 --> 02:50:07.263
SO WE ARE WELL UNDER WAY TO TRY

02:50:07.330 --> 02:50:09.032
AND ACCOMPLISH THAT FLARING

02:50:09.098 --> 02:50:11.568
WE'RE GONNA REDUCE BY TWENTY

02:50:11.634 --> 02:50:13.136
FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT- AND THE

02:50:13.202 --> 02:50:15.371
SAME COMPARISON BETWEEN TWENTY

02:50:15.438 --> 02:50:15.905
SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY

02:50:15.972 --> 02:50:18.908
THREE. ON AN UPSTREAM- SIDE OF

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:20.944
IT WHICH MEANS YOU'RE PRODUCING

02:50:21.010 --> 02:50:23.613
ARM NOT THE REFINING SIDE- WE

02:50:23.680 --> 02:50:25.315
ALSO HAVE INTENT THE

02:50:25.381 --> 02:50:26.516
COMMITMENTS WHERE WE ARE GOING

02:50:26.583 --> 02:50:28.384
TO REDUCE THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:50:28.451 --> 02:50:31.387
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL

02:50:31.454 --> 02:50:33.156
PRODUCTION BY FIVE TO TEN

02:50:33.222 --> 02:50:36.826
PERCENT- AND ALSO BE A NATURAL

02:50:36.893 --> 02:50:39.028
GAS PORTION OF THAT- IN THE

02:50:39.095 --> 02:50:39.829
GREENHOUSE GASSES ASSOCIATED

02:50:39.896 --> 02:50:41.564
WITH WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THAT

02:50:41.631 --> 02:50:43.833
DENSITY BY. FIVE PERCENT. AND

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:46.402
AGAIN IT IS COMPARING TWO

02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:49.105
THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN NUMBERS TO

02:50:49.172 --> 02:50:49.672
TWENTY TWENTY THREE NUMBERS

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:50.440
COOPERATE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT

02:50:50.506 --> 02:50:52.008
THIS AND THAT IT WAS APPROVED

02:50:52.075 --> 02:50:54.210
BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

02:50:54.277 --> 02:50:56.346
IT WILL AFFECT COMPENSATE FOR

02:50:56.412 --> 02:51:00.083
THE IMPORT BY THE IF THOSE-

02:51:00.149 --> 02:51:01.684
GOALS ARE MET OR NOT MET. AND

02:51:01.751 --> 02:51:03.553
DO YOU ACTUALLY IN A GREAT A

02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:05.922
PRICE ON CARBON INTO YOUR

02:51:05.989 --> 02:51:09.058
INTERNAL MATERIAL RISK METRICS-

02:51:09.125 --> 02:51:11.928
WE DO- AGAIN EVERY BUSINESS

02:51:11.995 --> 02:51:15.031
UNIT UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE- COST

02:51:15.098 --> 02:51:17.333
OF CARBON- WILL BE- ESPECIALLY

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:18.434
IF THERE'S CAP AND TRADE IN

02:51:18.501 --> 02:51:21.371
PLACE- AND THAT IS FIGURE IN

02:51:21.437 --> 02:51:23.873
TO- BUSINESS PLANS AS WE

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:25.475
PLANNED FOR FUTURE WORK AND

02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:26.409
BUDGET YOU HAVE A NUMBER DO YOU

02:51:26.476 --> 02:51:27.844
HAVE A- COMPANY WIDE NUMBER

02:51:27.910 --> 02:51:30.847
THAT YOU ASSUME FOR PASTA. WHEN

02:51:30.913 --> 02:51:37.253
YOU'RE DOING THAT ANALYSIS.

02:51:37.320 --> 02:51:38.354
ARIES BUT BY REGION OTHERS

02:51:38.421 --> 02:51:40.657
REGION BY A- YEAH SO I I'D

02:51:40.723 --> 02:51:42.025
CHAIRED I TO SHARE WITH YOU AS

02:51:42.091 --> 02:51:42.625
WELL SO THE THINGS WERE WITH

02:51:42.692 --> 02:51:43.626
CAL. A TWENTY NINETEEN WE FORM

02:51:43.693 --> 02:51:45.628
A JOY VENTURE CALLED BY GAS

02:51:45.695 --> 02:51:47.497
THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE- DIE

02:51:47.563 --> 02:51:49.932
JESTERS TO DERRY FORMS- THOSE

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:52.035
DI DI JESTERS COME ONLINE TO

02:51:52.101 --> 02:51:53.436
DIGEST THE MEN WHO WERE AND

02:51:53.503 --> 02:51:55.104
PRODUCE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS

02:51:55.171 --> 02:51:56.372
AND THEN THAT NATURAL GAS IS

02:51:56.439 --> 02:51:58.908
SHARED IN TO THE- EXISTING

02:51:58.975 --> 02:52:00.209
NATURAL GAS PIPELINE

02:52:00.276 --> 02:52:02.045
INFRASTRUCTURE- SO THAT IT CAN

02:52:02.111 --> 02:52:04.213
DISPLACE- YOU KNOW THE

02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:06.716
TRADITIONAL NATURAL GAS- GOING

02:52:06.783 --> 02:52:08.451
TO A DIFFERENT SOURCES.

02:52:08.518 --> 02:52:09.952
LIKEWISE WE ALSO HAVE AT OUR

02:52:10.019 --> 02:52:12.689
LOSS HEELS- FIELD A SOLO

02:52:12.755 --> 02:52:13.690
PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO COME

02:52:13.756 --> 02:52:15.625
ONLINE- HERE IN THE FIRST

02:52:15.692 --> 02:52:18.327
QUARTER OF THIS YEAR- AND THIS

02:52:18.394 --> 02:52:20.630
IS GOING TO PRODUCE-

02:52:20.697 --> 02:52:21.898
ELECTRICITY THAT IS GOING TO

02:52:21.964 --> 02:52:24.634
POWER THAT LAW SEALS- FIELD FOR

02:52:24.701 --> 02:52:27.036
US- AND WE BELIEVE OVER THE

02:52:27.103 --> 02:52:28.871
NEXT TWENTY YEARS THAT IT'S

02:52:28.938 --> 02:52:29.906
PROJECTED THAT IT'S GOING TO

02:52:29.972 --> 02:52:32.175
ELIMINATE- ONE MILLION METRIC

02:52:32.241 --> 02:52:36.345
TONS OF- OF EMISSIONS OF.

02:52:36.412 --> 02:52:38.915
CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. I

02:52:38.981 --> 02:52:39.549
GUESS THAT THE HIGH. THE

02:52:39.615 --> 02:52:42.485
HIGHEST LEVEL THOUGH FOR. UNDER

02:52:42.552 --> 02:52:44.020
THE OLD EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH

02:52:44.087 --> 02:52:46.923
STILL IN PLACE I'M NOT SAYING

02:52:46.989 --> 02:52:49.959
IT'S SUFFICIENT. I HAVE FRANKLY

02:52:50.026 --> 02:52:52.395
THING MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT-

02:52:52.462 --> 02:52:55.431
DO YOU THINK CHEVRON CAN MEET-

02:52:55.498 --> 02:52:58.568
THE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY

02:52:58.634 --> 02:52:59.102
FORTY FIVE WELL WITHIN ITS

02:52:59.168 --> 02:53:00.970
OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. I

02:53:01.037 --> 02:53:02.071
THINK THAT THAT IS A

02:53:02.138 --> 02:53:03.906
CHALLENGING TASK FORCE I WANT

02:53:03.973 --> 02:53:05.341
TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T I'M SAYING

02:53:05.408 --> 02:53:07.310
THAT THE PATH ON EXACTLY HOW WE

02:53:07.376 --> 02:53:08.945
WOULD ARRIVE THERE IS NOT A

02:53:09.011 --> 02:53:11.180
PARENT IF WE OPEN THE APERTURE

02:53:11.247 --> 02:53:12.749
AND WE SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO DO

02:53:12.815 --> 02:53:14.450
SOMETHING MORE ON A GLOBAL

02:53:14.517 --> 02:53:15.918
BASIS AND NOT JUST WITHIN THE

02:53:15.985 --> 02:53:18.254
BOUNDARIES. OF CALIFORNIA THAT

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:19.021
OPENS UP MANY MORE

02:53:19.088 --> 02:53:21.524
OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ACHIEVE

02:53:21.591 --> 02:53:24.260
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THE

02:53:24.327 --> 02:53:28.030
LAST QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT.

02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:30.032
YOUR YOUR OUR OIL MAJOR THE

02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:32.769

I BELIEVE THAT'S IT TRYING TO

02:53:40.243 --> 02:53:44.680
GET THERE THAT'S IT. AND SO. WE

02:53:44.747 --> 02:53:46.549
NEED TO PUT MORE PRESSURE AN

02:53:46.616 --> 02:53:49.418
ONUS I BELIEVE ON YOU TO STEP

02:53:49.485 --> 02:53:51.988

OF OPERATIONS ALL OVER THE

02:53:57.059 --> 02:54:01.798
WORLD. YEAH THAT THIS TURNING

02:54:01.864 --> 02:54:03.299
THE PAGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:54:03.366 --> 02:54:05.701
FROM CAL JAM I THINK WE ALSO

02:54:05.768 --> 02:54:09.172
WANT TO SEE WHAT THOSE GOOD

02:54:09.238 --> 02:54:11.908

PENALTY OR THE SUBPOENAING OF A

02:55:23.946 --> 02:55:26.616

REASONS TO DO WHAT THEY'RE

02:55:36.025 --> 02:55:38.961
TRYING TO DO. BUT FROM THE

02:55:39.028 --> 02:55:44.800
PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE. IT IT IT IT

02:55:44.867 --> 02:55:47.904
STRIKES ONE AS EITHER TURN

02:55:47.970 --> 02:55:49.171
OVERWHELMING AGENCY THAT'S

02:55:49.238 --> 02:55:51.674
ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED OR IN THIS

02:55:51.741 --> 02:55:55.211
NGO CASES ARE THE BIG GUY

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:56.746

THAT KIND OF PRACTICE IN IN

02:56:06.856 --> 02:56:08.391
CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF HOW IT

02:56:08.457 --> 02:56:08.891
INTERACTS WITH THE NGO

02:56:08.958 --> 02:56:11.093
COMMUNITY JERRY STERN I HAVE NO

SO- AGAIN I'M JUST- NOT NOT

02:56:16.532 --> 02:56:18.768
AWARE OF IT SO I COULD NOT

02:56:18.834 --> 02:56:20.569
COMMENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF

02:56:20.636 --> 02:56:22.305

WANT TO KNOW HOW FAR YOU GUYS

02:56:33.215 --> 02:56:35.451

A FIGHT SOMETIMES THE

02:56:38.154 --> 02:56:41.357
COURTROOM. BUT IF WE REALLY ARE

02:56:41.424 --> 02:56:44.627
GOING TO TURN THE PAGE HERE- I

02:56:44.694 --> 02:56:46.896
AM CONCERNED THAT. WE CAN SAY

02:56:46.963 --> 02:56:48.664
ONE THING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY.

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:51.000

WAY TO GIVE A ACTUAL TECHNICAL

02:57:05.114 --> 02:57:06.782
RESPONSE ON THE CARBON

02:57:06.849 --> 02:57:07.683
NEUTRALITY QUESTION I THINK

02:57:07.750 --> 02:57:10.886
THAT WOULD BE. ILLUMINATING FOR

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:13.489
US FOR THESE COMMITTEES BECAUSE-

02:57:13.556 --> 02:57:14.357
YOU HAVE A LOT OF IN HOUSE

02:57:14.423 --> 02:57:16.125
KNOWLEDGE I MEAN NO ONE

02:57:16.192 --> 02:57:19.028
PROBABLY UNDERSTANDS. ENERGY AS

02:57:19.095 --> 02:57:20.796

WALK AND CHEW GUM AND PERMIT OR

02:57:34.910 --> 02:57:36.379
NOT PERMIT OR ANALYZE IT ALL

02:57:36.445 --> 02:57:38.347
THE SAME TIME SO. TO EXTEND

02:57:38.414 --> 02:57:39.849
YOUR FOLKS CAN START TO DO SOME

02:57:39.915 --> 02:57:41.150
THAT TECHNICAL ANNOUNCE I THINK

02:57:41.217 --> 02:57:43.986

CONVERSATION AND- LIKE I SAID I

02:57:47.390 --> 02:57:49.625
KNOW WE'RE IN ALL STATE- BUT

02:57:49.692 --> 02:57:52.194
HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE ACTUALLY

02:57:52.261 --> 02:57:54.563
DO SOMETHING INNOVATIVE HERE.

02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:55.331
THAT'S NOT GONNA FEEL LIKE

02:57:55.398 --> 02:57:57.033
BUSINESS AS USUAL I COULDN'T

02:57:57.099 --> 02:57:58.334
AGREE MORE WE WOULD LOOK

02:57:58.401 --> 02:58:00.503
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER ON

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:03.205
THIS ALL RIGHT- WHAT YOU'VE

02:58:03.272 --> 02:58:06.108
BEEN WAY TOO PATIENT-

02:58:06.175 --> 02:58:08.144
CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF STUFF

02:58:08.210 --> 02:58:10.079
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN. YOUR

02:58:10.146 --> 02:58:11.180
DISTRICT OVER THE YEARS IN YOUR

02:58:11.247 --> 02:58:12.782

I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONING I

02:58:17.153 --> 02:58:19.255
THINK THAT WERE ALL AT LEAST

02:58:19.321 --> 02:58:20.756
THOSE OF US LEFT ON THE DíAS

02:58:20.823 --> 02:58:23.426
ARE. ALIGNING AND THINKING THE

02:58:23.492 --> 02:58:24.994
SAME SO YOU ASK SOME QUESTIONS

02:58:25.061 --> 02:58:27.296
BUT I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS

02:58:27.363 --> 02:58:27.730
AND I START WITH THE

02:58:27.797 --> 02:58:29.665
ADMINISTRATION- YOU HAVE MEANT

02:58:29.732 --> 02:58:31.400
IN A COUPLE TIMES THE

02:58:31.467 --> 02:58:33.936
IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING BUT IT.

02:58:34.003 --> 02:58:36.172
REQUESTED THAT YOU CAN HIRE-

02:58:36.238 --> 02:58:39.809
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT ASIDE

02:58:39.875 --> 02:58:41.710
FROM HIRING MORE ENFORCEMENT

02:58:41.777 --> 02:58:45.281
OFF. WERE OTHER DREADED. I IS

02:58:45.347 --> 02:58:47.083
YOU KNOW ARE WE AS A STATE NOW

02:58:47.149 --> 02:58:50.086
IMPLEMENTING ARE LOOKING AT- TO

02:58:50.152 --> 02:58:52.688
INCREASE ENFORCEMENT AND

02:58:52.755 --> 02:58:57.293
OVERSIGHT. YEAH I THINK THE BUT

02:58:57.359 --> 02:58:58.527
IS IT IS A BIG OF THAT NOW HAVE

02:58:58.594 --> 02:58:59.595
RECENTLY CREATED A AND

02:58:59.662 --> 02:59:01.130
ENFORCEMENT UNIT- THAT'S A

02:59:01.197 --> 02:59:03.165
STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS

02:59:03.232 --> 02:59:04.333
ENGINEERS AND ATTORNEYS WORKING

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:06.802
TOGETHER- AND THAT'S A WORK IN

02:59:06.869 --> 02:59:10.773
PROGRESS. WE HAVE- AND CAN DO

02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:11.774
SOME ADDITIONAL VALUATION O

02:59:11.841 --> 02:59:13.576
LOOK AT A POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE

02:59:13.642 --> 02:59:16.078
PROPOSALS- LOOK IT ADDITIONAL%

02:59:16.145 --> 02:59:18.114
WAYS TO- INCREASE OUR FORCE

02:59:18.180 --> 02:59:20.015
MEANT WE RECENTLY MET WITH US

02:59:20.082 --> 02:59:21.750
FOR AND TALKED ABOUT THE WAY

02:59:21.817 --> 02:59:23.052
THEY DO ENFORCEMENT IS

02:59:23.119 --> 02:59:23.752
DIFFERENT THAN HOW WE DO

02:59:23.819 --> 02:59:25.588
ENFORCEMENT THERE'S OPPORTUNITY

02:59:25.654 --> 02:59:28.090
FOR US TO CHANGE OUR- PENALTY

02:59:28.157 --> 02:59:30.693
CALCULATIONS- THAT WILL STAND

02:59:30.759 --> 02:59:33.762
UP UNDER A- LEGAL REVIEW IN AND

02:59:33.829 --> 02:59:35.364
DURABILITY- SO THAT WAS A

02:59:35.431 --> 02:59:37.066
CONVERSATION WE RECENTLY HAD. A

02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:39.201
IN THE LAST MONTH- BUT THERE'S

02:59:39.268 --> 02:59:40.169
A THERE'S A NUMBER WHAT THINGS

02:59:40.236 --> 02:59:42.872
WE CAN STILL DO- FOREIGN FORCE

02:59:42.938 --> 02:59:45.040
MEN AND THINKING ABOUT- IT

02:59:45.107 --> 02:59:46.075
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:47.810
THERE IS IT IS IT BIG PENALTIES

02:59:47.877 --> 02:59:50.279
IS THAT- BOND TEAM IS IT

02:59:50.346 --> 02:59:52.648
SOMETHING ELSE OF THEIR THEIR I

02:59:52.715 --> 02:59:54.783
THINK A LARGER CONVERSATION

02:59:54.850 --> 02:59:57.219
COULD BE HAD ABOUT THAT- WE

02:59:57.286 --> 02:59:58.220
COULD DO SOME RESEARCH ABOUT

02:59:58.287 --> 03:00:00.489
THIS- BY DIFFERENT INSURANCE

03:00:00.556 --> 03:00:03.626
AGENCY TO SEE WHAT IS OUR SKIN

03:00:03.692 --> 03:00:05.094
WITH THE BEST WITH THE MANAGER-

03:00:05.161 --> 03:00:07.396
IN ITS- NEW. RISK MITIGATION

03:00:07.463 --> 03:00:10.199
TOOLS I MEAN WE COULD I THINK

03:00:10.266 --> 03:00:16.438
THE IDYLLWILD PROGRAM. THERE

03:00:16.505 --> 03:00:17.439
WERE MORE WELL ABANDONED AS WE

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:18.807
ISSUE OVER EIGHT. PER AND

03:00:18.874 --> 03:00:19.408
TWENTY. AND THEY WERE. WELL A

03:00:19.475 --> 03:00:20.709
BAND PERMITS AND REALLY PER.

03:00:20.776 --> 03:00:23.245
AND PART OF THAT- IS THE OF

03:00:23.312 --> 03:00:25.581
MOVING TO TAKE CARE OF A LEGACY

03:00:25.648 --> 03:00:27.149
INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT WE'RE ALSO

03:00:27.216 --> 03:00:28.817
THE VITAL WELL FEES WE'RE

03:00:28.884 --> 03:00:30.786
BUILDING UP FOR A RESERVE TO BE

03:00:30.853 --> 03:00:32.521
ABLE TO START. A BAND IN

03:00:32.588 --> 03:00:33.656
WORKING TOWARDS SOME THE

03:00:33.722 --> 03:00:35.691
LIABILITY BUT- HOW DO WE MAKE

03:00:35.758 --> 03:00:37.159
SURE THAT WHILE PEOPLE IN

03:00:37.226 --> 03:00:38.827
OPERATIONS THAT THEY ARE.

03:00:38.894 --> 03:00:40.429
MAKING TO TAKING CARE OF THEIR

03:00:40.496 --> 03:00:41.497
THEIR ASSETS AND NOT LEAVE A

03:00:41.564 --> 03:00:43.399
TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK SO THERE

03:00:43.465 --> 03:00:44.600
SOME SOME THINGS WE CAN DO

03:00:44.667 --> 03:00:46.335
INTERNALLY BUT THE BIGGER-

03:00:46.402 --> 03:00:47.670
ITEMS THAT STILL ARE

03:00:47.736 --> 03:00:49.371
UNADDRESSED BY A RECENT REPORT.

03:00:49.438 --> 03:00:50.906
YOU KNOW THAT HAS LIABILITY

03:00:50.973 --> 03:00:52.775
BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO

03:00:52.841 --> 03:00:54.210
NINE BILLION- THAT'S OUT THERE

03:00:54.276 --> 03:00:55.377
AND THERE IS THERE SOMETHING

03:00:55.444 --> 03:00:56.612
THAT. YOU KNOW LEASE WE HAVE A

03:00:56.679 --> 03:00:57.780
POINT. YOU KNOW OF SOME

03:00:57.846 --> 03:00:59.582
SCENARIOS LOOK AT BUT NOW THE

03:00:59.648 --> 03:01:01.217
NEXT STEP IS WHAT WE DO TO

03:01:01.283 --> 03:01:03.018
MITIGATE THOSE RISKS. AND I'M

03:01:03.085 --> 03:01:05.688
GLAD THAT THAT'S BEING LOOKED

03:01:05.754 --> 03:01:07.556
AT. YOU KNOW IN PART BECAUSE

03:01:07.623 --> 03:01:08.157
THEY- OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE

03:01:08.224 --> 03:01:09.725
HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF ONE IDLE

03:01:09.792 --> 03:01:13.395
WHILE- AND THERE ARE OVER

03:01:13.462 --> 03:01:14.897
THIRTY THOUSAND THAT HAVE NOT.

03:01:14.964 --> 03:01:16.665
BEEN USED IN FIFTEEN YEARS OR

03:01:16.732 --> 03:01:18.801
MORE IN THE STATE. I AND THIS

03:01:18.867 --> 03:01:21.604
IS ONE AND THIS ONE HAS CAUSED

03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:23.172
FOR A LOT OF GREAT DISCUSSION

03:01:23.239 --> 03:01:25.407
AND SO- WHEN I HEAR- THAT IT'S

03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:27.676
COSTS TO IT. SO FAR NINE POINT

03:01:27.743 --> 03:01:30.746
TWO MILLION- SO TO CLEAN UP-

03:01:30.813 --> 03:01:34.383
DO WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. WE

03:01:34.450 --> 03:01:37.920
NOW ONE MORE THAN ON- GOES-

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:39.555
YOU KNOW IT CAUSES THIS LEVEL

03:01:39.622 --> 03:01:42.558
OF PROBLEM AND THE- COMPANY

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:44.360
DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

03:01:44.426 --> 03:01:45.361
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:01:45.427 --> 03:01:47.763
DONE- AND THEN YOU HAVE THE

03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:48.931
ORPHAN WELLS. RIGHT TO HAVE

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:50.966
IDLE AND ORPHANED SO A THINK

03:01:51.033 --> 03:01:52.101
THAT THERE'S A LOT FOR US TO

03:01:52.167 --> 03:01:54.003
THINK ABOUT. AND I AM GLAD TO

03:01:54.069 --> 03:01:56.372
HEAR. THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT-

03:01:56.438 --> 03:01:58.474
APPROACH IS BEING CONSIDERED-

03:01:58.540 --> 03:02:01.076
IN TERMS OF WHAT E CAN DO TO

03:02:01.143 --> 03:02:02.678
ENSURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ON

03:02:02.745 --> 03:02:05.514
THE HOOK FOR THIS. SO IT IT

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:08.050
STRETCHING OVER I'M A JUST WANT

03:02:08.117 --> 03:02:12.421
TO ASK. MISTER LIKE COULD BE IF

03:02:12.488 --> 03:02:15.424
YOU CAN JUST- TALK YOU MENTION

03:02:15.491 --> 03:02:16.959
A COST NINE POINT TWO MILLION

03:02:17.026 --> 03:02:19.828
TO CLEAN UP THAT'S- AND THAT

03:02:19.895 --> 03:02:22.731
THIS WAS BILL WAS OVER ONE ACRE

03:02:22.798 --> 03:02:24.366
pOF THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

03:02:24.433 --> 03:02:26.969
ACRES AND THAT YOU HAVE AND

03:02:27.036 --> 03:02:29.004
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT

03:02:29.071 --> 03:02:30.806
A CHEVRON AND DOING DIFFERENTLY

03:02:30.873 --> 03:02:32.341
NOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS THAT IS

03:02:32.408 --> 03:02:34.443
A LOT OF MONEY TO CLEAN UP ONE

03:02:34.510 --> 03:02:35.778
ACRE WHEN YOU HAVE TWENTY SEVEN

03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:37.813
THOUSAND. AND THIS IS ONE

03:02:37.880 --> 03:02:39.214
IDYLLWILD WHAT'S BEEN DONE

03:02:39.281 --> 03:02:40.616
DIFFERENTLY SO FIRST AND

03:02:40.683 --> 03:02:42.051
FOREMOST IS TO PREVENT THIS

03:02:42.117 --> 03:02:43.352
FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN THAT

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:45.654
THAT'S THE- PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

03:02:45.721 --> 03:02:47.456
THERE AND SO WHAT WE DOING TO

03:02:47.523 --> 03:02:48.824
DRIVE THAT WE ARE MORE

03:02:48.891 --> 03:02:50.426
AGGRESSIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE

03:02:50.492 --> 03:02:51.827
REVIEWS THAT WE'RE DOING ON ALL

03:02:51.894 --> 03:02:54.296
OF OUR WELLS- WE HAVE NOW

03:02:54.363 --> 03:02:57.266
REVIEWED- ELEVEN. ELEVEN

03:02:57.333 --> 03:03:00.703
HUNDRED- IDA WELLS INCLUDING

03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:02.471
SOME THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED

03:03:02.538 --> 03:03:04.606
ALREADY AND OUR STUDY IN THOSE

03:03:04.673 --> 03:03:05.974
VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:03:06.041 --> 03:03:08.610
THERE IS- NO CHANCE FOR A

03:03:08.677 --> 03:03:09.912
NOTHER LEAGUE PATH TO GET TO

03:03:09.978 --> 03:03:10.946
THE SURFACE OF THE OF THIS

03:03:11.013 --> 03:03:13.048
ANALYSIS- WE ARE MORE

03:03:13.115 --> 03:03:16.552
AGGRESSIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE-

03:03:16.618 --> 03:03:18.654
MONITORING OF THE FIELD I

03:03:18.721 --> 03:03:20.255
DESCRIBED TO YOU BEFORE ON THE

03:03:20.322 --> 03:03:23.292
GROUND- MOVEMENT MONITORING.

03:03:23.359 --> 03:03:25.894
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE- WE ARE

03:03:25.961 --> 03:03:27.763
CONTINUING TO TIGHTEN UP THE

03:03:27.830 --> 03:03:28.797
FREQUENCY AT WHICH WE DO THAT

03:03:28.864 --> 03:03:31.066
THE EVALUATION TIME- HOW WE

03:03:31.133 --> 03:03:32.901
PROCESS THE DATA SO THAT WE ARE

03:03:32.968 --> 03:03:34.236
MORE RESPONSIVE ON

03:03:34.303 --> 03:03:35.671
UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT'S

03:03:35.738 --> 03:03:38.474
GOING ON AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING

03:03:38.540 --> 03:03:40.342
TO DO IS MONITOR EXACTLY WHEN

03:03:40.409 --> 03:03:46.815
WE CAN. AT A L. IT'S IN TECH SO

03:03:46.882 --> 03:03:47.483
THAT ONCE AGAIN WE CAN A IN AND

03:03:47.549 --> 03:03:48.450
IT A BAN THAT RIGHT AWAY SO

03:03:48.517 --> 03:03:49.818
DOES NOT BECOME A LEAGUE. AND

03:03:49.885 --> 03:03:52.154
OR LEAD TO A SEAT. OKAY THANK

03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:54.757
YOU AND- THE YOU KNOW I THINK

03:03:54.823 --> 03:03:57.493
IT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED. BY MY

03:03:57.559 --> 03:04:00.195
COLLEAGUES THAT- ONE OF THE

03:04:00.262 --> 03:04:01.764
REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IN PART

03:04:01.830 --> 03:04:03.732
IS BECAUSE THIS IS CHEVRON AND

03:04:03.799 --> 03:04:06.001
YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST-

03:04:06.068 --> 03:04:08.137
COMPANIES HERE IN OUR STATE-

03:04:08.203 --> 03:04:09.772
BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE

03:04:09.838 --> 03:04:11.507
A CAPACITY TO DO SOME THINGS

03:04:11.573 --> 03:04:13.041
THAT. OTHER COMPANIES DON'T

03:04:13.108 --> 03:04:15.677
HAVE- THE CAPACITY TO DO SO

03:04:15.744 --> 03:04:19.715
WHEN WE HEAR THAT- THAT EVEN A

03:04:19.782 --> 03:04:21.617
COMPANY AS BIG AS YOU THAT HAS

03:04:21.683 --> 03:04:23.185
I MEAN PERSON NOW THE HAS

03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:25.320
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED STUDIES AND

03:04:25.387 --> 03:04:28.757
RESEARCH- YOU HAVE THE A BIT.

03:04:28.824 --> 03:04:32.127
EVEN YOUR STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP

03:04:32.194 --> 03:04:34.496
WITH- ONE WELL THAT YOU KNOW

03:04:34.563 --> 03:04:39.067
HAS LEAKED. HOW I MEAN HOW DO

03:04:39.134 --> 03:04:41.103
WE ALIGN THAT WITH WITH THE

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:43.672
IDEA THAT WE I MEAN WE STILL

03:04:43.739 --> 03:04:46.041
HAVE CONCERNS- YOU'RE A BIG

03:04:46.108 --> 03:04:47.843
COMPANY YOU CAN DO IT SOME

03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:49.445
WOULD SAY THAT IF CHEVRON CAN'T

03:04:49.511 --> 03:04:50.579
DO IT THEN THAT MEANS WE REALLY

03:04:50.646 --> 03:04:51.580
SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT

03:04:51.647 --> 03:04:55.217
EVERYBODY ELSE AS WELL. I MEAN.

03:04:55.284 --> 03:04:56.652
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT HOW

03:04:56.718 --> 03:04:57.886
DO YOU HOW CAN YOU HELP US

03:04:57.953 --> 03:04:59.588
THINK ABOUT THIS THIS ISSUE

03:04:59.655 --> 03:05:01.824
THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH. WE

03:05:01.890 --> 03:05:04.092
CAN OPERATE THIS SAFELY WE HAVE

03:05:04.159 --> 03:05:05.394
BEEN DOING SO FOR MANY YEARS

03:05:05.461 --> 03:05:07.229
AND WE CAN DO SO FOR MANY YEARS

03:05:07.296 --> 03:05:09.131
TO COME IT'S A MATTER OF ONCE

03:05:09.198 --> 03:05:12.000
AGAIN- STAYING- CONSISTENT

03:05:12.067 --> 03:05:15.304
WITH- SOLID- PRACTICES TAKEN

03:05:15.370 --> 03:05:17.105
LESSONS LEARNED FROM. EVENTS

03:05:17.172 --> 03:05:18.874
LIKE WHAT WE JUST HAD AN

03:05:18.941 --> 03:05:20.642
IMPROVING WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

03:05:20.709 --> 03:05:22.678
GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. SO

03:05:22.744 --> 03:05:23.979
I WOULD SAY THAT YOU JUST HAVE

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:25.347
TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH THAT

03:05:25.414 --> 03:05:28.116
PIECE OF IT AND ONCE AGAIN-

03:05:28.183 --> 03:05:30.586
MITIGATE- THOSE THINGS OUT

03:05:30.652 --> 03:05:31.887
THERE THAT CAN LEAD TO

03:05:31.954 --> 03:05:35.357
POSSIBILITIES- OF SEEPS- AND

03:05:35.424 --> 03:05:38.126
OUR OTHER- FAILURES. SO WHEN

03:05:38.193 --> 03:05:40.128
WE- ARE LOOKING AT PARTICULAR

03:05:40.195 --> 03:05:42.831
AT THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION-

03:05:42.898 --> 03:05:45.000
THERE WAS. A IN ANNOUNCEMENT ON

03:05:45.067 --> 03:05:46.335
MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT THE

03:05:46.401 --> 03:05:48.971
RELEASE WAS STOPPED- ONLY TO

03:05:49.037 --> 03:05:53.442
SEE IT RESTART- OVER AND THAT.

03:05:53.509 --> 03:05:55.611
WE START TO. KIND OF LOSE

03:05:55.677 --> 03:05:59.448
CONFIDENCE AND SO WHAT WHAT

03:05:59.515 --> 03:06:01.717
WHAT IS HAPPENING FROM. YOU

03:06:01.783 --> 03:06:03.752
KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TO

03:06:03.819 --> 03:06:06.255
ENSURE THAT IT WHEN WE GET AN

03:06:06.321 --> 03:06:08.190
ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT STOPPED

03:06:08.257 --> 03:06:11.059
THE RELEASE A STOP TO- THAT WE

03:06:11.126 --> 03:06:13.795
DON'T SEE IT- CONTINUE. TO

03:06:13.862 --> 03:06:15.597
RESTORE OVER AND OVER SURE NO

03:06:15.664 --> 03:06:17.900
THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND-

03:06:17.966 --> 03:06:19.001
WHAT YOU WERE SEEING AT THAT

03:06:19.067 --> 03:06:22.304
PARTICULAR POINT WAS THE- AT

03:06:22.371 --> 03:06:23.539
THAT POINT WE WERE NOT AT

03:06:23.605 --> 03:06:25.374
EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT WE WERE NOT

03:06:25.440 --> 03:06:27.109
ABLE TO MANAGE THE SUBSIDENCE

03:06:27.175 --> 03:06:28.510
BECAUSE WE HAD A STEAM BLOCK

03:06:28.577 --> 03:06:30.479
THAT WAS IN PLACE. SO I STILL

03:06:30.546 --> 03:06:32.481
HAVE MY SAME CONDITIONS DOWN

03:06:32.548 --> 03:06:34.449
HOLE I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY

03:06:34.516 --> 03:06:36.985
TO MANAGE MY SUBSIDENCE- BUT

03:06:37.052 --> 03:06:38.253
BECAUSE OF THE STEAM BLOCK

03:06:38.320 --> 03:06:39.588
THAT'S THERE I CAN'T INJECT

03:06:39.655 --> 03:06:42.024
ANYTHING INTO IT- AND SO

03:06:42.090 --> 03:06:43.191
THERE'S A LONG PERIOD OF TIME

03:06:43.258 --> 03:06:44.393
THAT GOES WHERE YOU'RE STILL

03:06:44.459 --> 03:06:45.360
CONTINUE AND SEE THE

03:06:45.427 --> 03:06:47.229
SUBSIDENCE. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE

03:06:47.296 --> 03:06:48.630
SQUEEZING A BALLOON OR THROUGH

03:06:48.697 --> 03:06:50.699
THE TOOTHPASTE- YOU'RE SINKING

03:06:50.766 --> 03:06:52.901
DOWN RIGHT HERE YOU'RE MOVING-

03:06:52.968 --> 03:06:55.304
FLUIDS- TO THE OUTSIDES OF IT

03:06:55.370 --> 03:06:57.472
WHICH LED TO ADDITIONAL SEEPS

03:06:57.539 --> 03:06:59.241
SITES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE

03:06:59.308 --> 03:07:01.877
DEALING WITH- WAY SOON AS WE

03:07:01.944 --> 03:07:03.278
HAD THE ABILITY TO START

03:07:03.345 --> 03:07:05.314
INTRODUCING WATER AS OPPOSED TO

03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:07.482
STEAM- WHERE THE WHERE WE WERE

03:07:07.549 --> 03:07:09.451
ABLE TO START REPLACING THAT WE

03:07:09.518 --> 03:07:10.218
WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THE

03:07:10.285 --> 03:07:12.454
SUBSIDENCE- AND ONCE AGAIN WE

03:07:12.521 --> 03:07:14.056
SAW MORE EQUILIBRIUM TAKE PLACE

03:07:14.122 --> 03:07:16.625
AND THAT THESE ADDITIONAL SEEPS

03:07:16.692 --> 03:07:18.493
SITES STOPPED. TO THE POINT

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.529
THAT RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE ONE

03:07:20.596 --> 03:07:22.564
THAT IS ACTIVE AND THE ONE Y.

03:07:22.631 --> 03:07:24.333
HAS NOT HAD ANY SLEEP SITES FOR

03:07:24.399 --> 03:07:27.169
SOME MONTHS NOW. OKAY THANK YOU

03:07:27.235 --> 03:07:28.337
AT A YOU KNOW OVERALL I THINK

03:07:28.403 --> 03:07:30.272
THAT THIS IS BEEN. VERY

03:07:30.339 --> 03:07:31.640
INFORMATIONAL AND I AND I DO

03:07:31.707 --> 03:07:34.309
HOPE THAT WE- CONTINUE TO ASK

03:07:34.376 --> 03:07:36.478
THESE QUESTIONS I FEEL LIKE

03:07:36.545 --> 03:07:37.012
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO

03:07:37.079 --> 03:07:39.314
UNDERSTAND- WHAT IT'S GOING TO

03:07:39.381 --> 03:07:41.617
TAKE- THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

03:07:41.683 --> 03:07:43.652
NUMBER OF IDLE AND OR PHÃN.

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:47.723
WELLS IS SO GREAT THAT I JUST

03:07:47.789 --> 03:07:49.224
KEEP THINKING WHAT HAPPENS IF

03:07:49.291 --> 03:07:52.961
THERE ARE MULTIPLE- WELLS THAT

03:07:53.028 --> 03:07:55.097
REQUIRED THIS MUCH INTENSITY

03:07:55.163 --> 03:07:59.301
THAT RIGHT BACK. YOU KNOW

03:07:59.368 --> 03:08:00.736
RELEASE AT SERVICE EXPRESS TO

03:08:00.802 --> 03:08:01.837
THE EXTENT THAT THEY- I DO KNOW

03:08:01.903 --> 03:08:03.505
WHY WE GO THE RE AND HAPPENS

03:08:03.572 --> 03:08:06.642
PARTICULARLY WITH THE- USERS OF

03:08:06.708 --> 03:08:08.610
DIFFERENT SIZES- THIS IS

03:08:08.677 --> 03:08:10.712
CHEVRON BUT THERE ARE OTHER

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:11.980
PRODUCERS DIFFERENT SIZES WITH

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:15.217
DIFFERENT- CAPACITIES I HAD TO

03:08:15.283 --> 03:08:18.387
DO PERHAPS NOT IDEAL OR NOT NOT

03:08:18.453 --> 03:08:19.655
THE SAME- BUT A DIFFERENT

03:08:19.721 --> 03:08:23.325
AMOUNT. OF YOU KNOW OF

03:08:23.392 --> 03:08:25.560
INTERVENTION TO TRY TO. REMEDY

03:08:25.627 --> 03:08:27.229
THE PROBLEM- SO I HOPE THAT

03:08:27.295 --> 03:08:28.363
WE'RE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

03:08:28.430 --> 03:08:31.066

ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE. WE

03:10:44.533 --> 03:10:45.367
THINK IT'S REALLY ANSWER

REMARKABLE THINGS THAT THE

THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND

03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:20.095
I'VE BEEN HONORED AND APPOINTED

03:12:20.161 --> 03:12:21.596
BY THE STATE TO SERVE ON MANY

03:12:21.663 --> 03:12:23.064

03:12:38.446 --> 03:12:40.282
OTHER EFFORTS BECAUSE WE

03:12:40.348 --> 03:12:40.715
BELIEVE IN CONTINUAL

IMPROVEMENT. ALSO IF YOU SIZE

03:12:44.286 --> 03:12:45.487
IN THEM IN A MOMENT BUT THERE

03:12:45.553 --> 03:12:46.588
IS REALLY NOTHING MORE

03:12:46.655 --> 03:12:47.956
IMPORTANT TO US I THINK AS

03:12:48.023 --> 03:12:49.324
YOU'VE HEARD IS THE HEALTH AND

03:12:49.391 --> 03:12:51.426
SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE

PROUD TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S

03:12:58.934 --> 03:13:01.236
ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. AND WE

03:13:01.303 --> 03:13:03.471
PRODUCE PROBABLY THE MOST

03:13:03.538 --> 03:13:06.508
CLEANEST. OF AFFORDABLE ENERGY.

03:13:06.574 --> 03:13:08.944
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND YOU

03:13:09.010 --> 03:13:09.544
ARE ALL LEADERS IN MAKING THAT

03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:12.080
HAPPEN. CALIFORNIA'S

03:13:12.147 --> 03:13:12.814
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS DO

03:13:12.881 --> 03:13:14.916
LEAD THE WORLD AND THE FURTHER

03:13:14.983 --> 03:13:16.918
STUDY OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY

03:13:16.985 --> 03:13:19.854
BEST SCIENCE REAL DATA ABOUT

03:13:19.921 --> 03:13:20.689
PRODUCTION PRACTICES IN OUR

03:13:20.755 --> 03:13:22.490
STATE WILL REALLY ONLY

03:13:22.557 --> 03:13:24.592
RECONFIRM THIS LEADERSHIP THAT

YOU ALL HAVE AND WE'LL HAVE YOU

03:13:26.461 --> 03:13:27.696
HEARD SECRETARY CROWFOOT

03:13:27.762 --> 03:13:29.264
MENTION THE IMPORTANCE OF

03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:31.232
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SCIENCE

03:13:31.299 --> 03:13:33.702
HEALTH AND SAFETY AN ECONOMY WE

03:13:33.768 --> 03:13:35.971
SUPPORT THOSE GOALS AS WELL.

03:13:36.037 --> 03:13:37.372
BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FRAME

03:13:37.439 --> 03:13:38.807
WORK WHICH WE ALL LIVE IN I

03:13:38.873 --> 03:13:40.208
KNOW YOU DON'T IGNORE THE

03:13:40.275 --> 03:13:41.643
FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE ALL LIVE

03:13:41.710 --> 03:13:43.411
SO WHY WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON

03:13:43.478 --> 03:13:45.447
ALL THESE PERMANENT

03:13:45.513 --> 03:13:46.047
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED

03:13:46.114 --> 03:13:48.283
ABOUT TODAY. ONE IN SIX

03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:49.651
CALIFORNIAS STILL STRUGGLE TO

03:13:49.718 --> 03:13:51.820
AFFORD NECESSITIES. THE AVERAGE

03:13:51.886 --> 03:13:54.356
FAMILY TO WORKING PARENTS SPENT

03:13:54.422 --> 03:13:55.757
25% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING

03:13:55.824 --> 03:13:58.193
AND UTILITIES THE AVERAGE TWO

03:13:58.259 --> 03:13:59.961
BEDROOM IS 55% HIGHER IN

03:14:00.028 --> 03:14:01.896
CALIFORNIA THAN THE NATION AND

03:14:01.963 --> 03:14:03.631
ENERGY COSTS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR

03:14:03.698 --> 03:14:07.836
OF THAT. SO AT THE SAME TIME-

03:14:07.902 --> 03:14:08.903
THE OIL INDUSTRY IS IN A

03:14:08.970 --> 03:14:11.106
POSITION. IN A AND FRANKLY A

03:14:11.172 --> 03:14:12.173
DIRE POSITION BECAUSE THE

03:14:12.240 --> 03:14:13.341
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AROUND

03:14:13.408 --> 03:14:14.843
ISSUING PERMITS OF COURSE

03:14:14.909 --> 03:14:16.778
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:14:16.845 --> 03:14:18.279
THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS. AND

03:14:18.346 --> 03:14:20.315
THESE POLICY CHANGES AND THE

03:14:20.382 --> 03:14:22.717
OIL INDUSTRY'S.REACTION TO

03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:23.852
THEM AND THE DELAYS IN

03:14:23.918 --> 03:14:26.054
SACRAMENTO DO LEAD TO REAL LIFE

03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:27.989
IN PACKS AFFORDABILITY LOST

03:14:28.056 --> 03:14:32.260
JOBS. LOCAL TAX BENEFITS ENDING.

03:14:32.327 --> 03:14:33.294
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

03:14:33.361 --> 03:14:35.296
WE PRODUCE IN THE TOUGHEST

03:14:35.363 --> 03:14:36.398
REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

03:14:36.464 --> 03:14:38.833
INCLUDING LABOR HEALTH SAFETY

03:14:38.900 --> 03:14:41.403
STANDARDS IN THE WORLD IN

03:14:41.469 --> 03:14:44.339
CALIFORNIA BARNUM. SO EFFORTS

03:14:44.406 --> 03:14:46.307
TO LIMIT ELIMINATE OR

03:14:46.374 --> 03:14:48.743
DRAMATICALLY KERR PRODUCTION.

03:14:48.810 --> 03:14:49.277
DOES NOTHING TO ELIMINATE

03:14:49.344 --> 03:14:52.213
DEMAND. AND ONLY HURTS OUR

03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:53.548
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL

03:14:53.615 --> 03:14:55.950
CLIMATE CHANGE AND DECREASES

03:14:56.017 --> 03:14:57.218
OUR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE BY

03:14:57.285 --> 03:14:59.287
ENCOURAGING MORE IMPORTS FROM

03:14:59.354 --> 03:15:00.889
AREAS WITH LESS STRINGENT

03:15:00.955 --> 03:15:03.691
ENVIRONMENTAL RAKES. SO JUST

03:15:03.758 --> 03:15:07.395
PUT UP ONE QUICK SLIDE HERE. SO

03:15:07.462 --> 03:15:08.630
THE ENERGY DEMANDS OF THE

03:15:08.696 --> 03:15:10.331
WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

03:15:10.398 --> 03:15:11.633
AS YOU ALL KNOW CONTINUE TO

03:15:11.699 --> 03:15:14.069
GROW WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST

03:15:14.135 --> 03:15:15.437
CONSUMER OF TRANSPORTATION

03:15:15.503 --> 03:15:19.307
FUELS ON THE PLANET. AS A STATE.

03:15:19.374 --> 03:15:21.042
WITH ONLY CHINA AND THE U. S.

03:15:21.109 --> 03:15:23.478
IN FRONT OF US NINETY PART 6%

03:15:23.545 --> 03:15:25.413
OF ALL TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN

03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:27.248
THE STATE COMES FROM PATROLLING.

03:15:27.315 --> 03:15:29.017
I ONLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE THIS

03:15:29.084 --> 03:15:30.151
IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WERE

03:15:30.218 --> 03:15:31.419
HAVING THE CONVERSATION OF

03:15:31.486 --> 03:15:35.723
WHERE WE GO IN THE FUTURE.

03:15:35.790 --> 03:15:38.993
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. SOON TO

03:15:39.060 --> 03:15:40.929
BE FIFTEEN PEOPLE NOT TO NEARLY

03:15:40.995 --> 03:15:43.364
FOR FUTURE DRIVE THIRTY MILLION

03:15:43.431 --> 03:15:48.169
VEHICLES. EVERY DAY. NOW IT'S

03:15:48.236 --> 03:15:49.771
GREAT WE HAVE ALMOST SEVEN HER

03:15:49.838 --> 03:15:51.506
THOUSAND LECTURED VEHICLES

03:15:51.573 --> 03:15:52.407
WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO ELECTRIC

03:15:52.474 --> 03:15:54.809
VEHICLES FAILED GET INTO

03:15:54.876 --> 03:15:55.310
DETAILS ON OUR COMPANIES

03:15:55.376 --> 03:15:57.112
INVESTING AND- MANY ELEMENTS OF

03:15:57.178 --> 03:15:59.247
THEM. AND WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE

03:15:59.314 --> 03:16:01.182
GOALS OF FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC

03:16:01.249 --> 03:16:03.318
VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT

03:16:03.384 --> 03:16:04.819
FIVE MILLION LIKE TRICKLES WE

03:16:04.886 --> 03:16:05.386
HAVE THIRTY MILLION TURNER

03:16:05.453 --> 03:16:07.989
PROFESSION ENGINES IT'S A BIT

03:16:08.056 --> 03:16:08.556
OF A GAP IT'S GOING TO TAKE

03:16:08.623 --> 03:16:11.326
AWHILE. SO ONE THING WELL KNOWN

03:16:11.392 --> 03:16:14.195
I SAY THIS OFTEN IS EVERYDAY.

03:16:14.262 --> 03:16:16.264
WE'LL WAKE UP HOPEFULLY. WE

03:16:16.331 --> 03:16:17.732
EXPECT THREE THINGS WE TURN OUR

03:16:17.799 --> 03:16:19.033
LIGHTS ON WE HEAT AND COOL OUR

03:16:19.100 --> 03:16:20.969
HOMES AND WE DRIVE FROM A TO B.

03:16:21.035 --> 03:16:22.036
THAT'S EVERYDAY THAT'S A BIG

03:16:22.103 --> 03:16:24.539
TASK. WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO

03:16:24.606 --> 03:16:25.039
DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE

03:16:25.106 --> 03:16:26.875
AGGRESSIVE GOALS. AND HOW THE

03:16:26.941 --> 03:16:28.843
STATE GOES ABOUT THAT IS SUPER

03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:29.444
IMPORTANT I DON'T NEED TO TELL

03:16:29.511 --> 03:16:31.646
YOU THAT. BUT GOVERNOR NEWSOME

03:16:31.713 --> 03:16:33.281
STATED ALSO AND I THINK YOU

03:16:33.348 --> 03:16:35.183
HEARD FROM SECRETARY CROWFOOT.

03:16:35.250 --> 03:16:36.284
THE TRANSITION CANNOT HAPPEN

03:16:36.351 --> 03:16:38.319
OVERNIGHT IT MUST ADVANCE IN A

03:16:38.386 --> 03:16:40.155
DELIBERATE WAY. TO PROTECT

03:16:40.221 --> 03:16:41.489
PEOPLE ARE VARMINT AND OUR

03:16:41.556 --> 03:16:45.126
ECONOMY. SO THE THIRD ONE IS WE

03:16:45.193 --> 03:16:47.228
CONSUME DAILY JUST PUT IN A

03:16:47.295 --> 03:16:48.630
CONTEXT AGAIN FORTY TWO MILLION

BILLION MILES HERE. AND THAT TO

03:17:00.175 --> 03:17:00.608
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS OUR

03:17:00.675 --> 03:17:01.910
HIGHEST LEVEL CONSUMPTION BUT

03:17:01.976 --> 03:17:03.511
HISTORICALLY CONSUMPTION

03:17:03.578 --> 03:17:07.982
INCREASES WITH IMPROVED ECONOMY.

03:17:08.049 --> 03:17:10.084
I'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF.

03:17:10.151 --> 03:17:11.653
WEEK WEEK AS CALIFORNIANS

03:17:11.719 --> 03:17:13.655

03:17:16.724 --> 03:17:18.393
REFINERS SO WE CONSUME EVERY

03:17:18.459 --> 03:17:22.063
BIT OF IT. BUT IT'S ONLY 30% OF

03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:24.098
WHAT WE MAKE. AND WE KNOW AND

03:17:24.165 --> 03:17:26.000
YOU'VE HEARD 70% OF IT COMES

03:17:26.067 --> 03:17:28.236
FROM. OTHER PLACES TO MEET OUR

03:17:28.303 --> 03:17:29.671
ENERGY TO MASS NOW I'D LIKE TO

03:17:29.737 --> 03:17:31.673
FLIP THOSE NUMBERS. I'D REALLY

03:17:31.739 --> 03:17:33.541
LIKE TO PRODUCE 70% HERE AND

03:17:33.608 --> 03:17:35.210
REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL ON

03:17:35.276 --> 03:17:37.946
FOREIGN ORAL. SO BUT THIS IS

03:17:38.012 --> 03:17:41.149
THE NUMBERS WE HAVE TODAY. SO

03:17:41.216 --> 03:17:42.217
TO YOUR POINT YOUR QUESTION

03:17:42.283 --> 03:17:44.519
EARLIER WHERE DO THESE SOURCES

03:17:44.586 --> 03:17:45.119
OF CRUDE OIL COME FROM THERE'S

03:17:45.186 --> 03:17:47.722
A CHART SO THESE FOREIGN

03:17:47.789 --> 03:17:49.591
COUNTRIES SAUDI ARABIA ECUADOR

03:17:49.657 --> 03:17:51.993
COLOMBIA A ROCK. AS YOU ALL

03:17:52.060 --> 03:17:53.194
KNOW THAT DON'T POLITE THEY

03:17:53.261 --> 03:17:55.463
DON'T APPLY CALIFORNIA SAFETY

03:17:55.530 --> 03:17:56.531
HUMAN RIGHTS LABOR ENVIRONMENT

03:17:56.598 --> 03:17:58.766
RAKES. WE HEARD EARLIER WE ARE

03:17:58.833 --> 03:18:00.735
PART OF THE BIGGER PICTURE AND

03:18:00.802 --> 03:18:03.271
THIS DOES NEED TO BE PART OF

03:18:03.338 --> 03:18:03.805
THAT CONVERSATION AS WE GO

03:18:03.871 --> 03:18:06.941
FORWARD. HERE'S JUST SOME OF

03:18:07.008 --> 03:18:09.143
THE IMPACTS ON WHAT IS THE WHAT

03:18:09.210 --> 03:18:10.011
ANY KIND OF STATEWIDE BAN WOULD

03:18:10.078 --> 03:18:11.913
DO. AND IT REALLY HAPPENS

03:18:11.980 --> 03:18:13.147
WHETHER IT'S BàN OR NOT

03:18:13.214 --> 03:18:15.116
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ISSUED

03:18:15.183 --> 03:18:15.683
PERMITS IT REALLY ACTS AS A

03:18:15.750 --> 03:18:18.786
BAND. SO IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF

03:18:18.853 --> 03:18:20.021
ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TAX

03:18:20.088 --> 03:18:21.456
REVENUES TO SCHOOLS PUBLIC

03:18:21.522 --> 03:18:23.258
SAFETY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS YOU

03:18:23.324 --> 03:18:25.693
HEARD FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. JOBS

03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:27.895
NOT JUST JOBS CAREERS. THESE

03:18:27.962 --> 03:18:29.130
ARE THESE ARE HIGH PAYING

03:18:29.197 --> 03:18:30.598
CAREER JOBS THAT YOU HAVE YOU

03:18:30.665 --> 03:18:32.567
HEARD PREVIOUSLY. AND THERE

03:18:32.634 --> 03:18:34.135
DIVERSE CAREERS FROM ALL

03:18:34.202 --> 03:18:35.870
SPECTRUMS INCLUDING THOSE WITH

03:18:35.937 --> 03:18:37.238
HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATIONS ALL THE

03:18:37.305 --> 03:18:39.340
WAY UP. TO OBVIOUSLY MASTER'S

03:18:39.407 --> 03:18:41.209
PROGRAMS WITH BENEFITS

03:18:41.276 --> 03:18:42.877
RETIREMENT PLANS THAT NOT ONLY

03:18:42.944 --> 03:18:44.746
ARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN

03:18:44.812 --> 03:18:46.814
OUR INDUSTRY BUT ALSO FOR.

03:18:46.881 --> 03:18:48.850
THEIR FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN.

03:18:48.916 --> 03:18:50.084
I'M HAPPY AS PROVIDE TO THE

03:18:50.151 --> 03:18:52.153
COMMITEE A REPORT CAPITAL

03:18:52.220 --> 03:18:56.658
MATRIX JUST COMPLETED EXCUSE ME.

03:18:56.724 --> 03:19:01.095
IT'S LIKE. AND WE CAN GIVE YOU

03:19:01.162 --> 03:19:02.597
THIS REPORT IT'S THE IMPACT OF

03:19:02.664 --> 03:19:04.198
STATEWIDE OIL PRODUCTION BAN ON

03:19:04.265 --> 03:19:05.833
DOWNSTREAM PATROL PETROLEUM

03:19:05.900 --> 03:19:08.903
MARKETS AND IT ESTIMATED-

03:19:08.970 --> 03:19:10.104
DEPENDING ON THE TIME PERIOD

03:19:10.171 --> 03:19:11.506
WE'R TALKING ABOUT INCREASED

03:19:11.572 --> 03:19:14.108
GAS PRICES FROM SIXTY CENTS TO

03:19:14.175 --> 03:19:14.676
TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE

03:19:14.742 --> 03:19:17.312
CENTS A GALLON. SO PROPONENTS

03:19:17.378 --> 03:19:18.813
OF BANDS WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA

03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:20.381
100% DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN

03:19:20.448 --> 03:19:22.317
SOURCES AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT

03:19:22.383 --> 03:19:24.252
EVEN. THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY

03:19:24.319 --> 03:19:26.154
COSTLY APPROACH IF WE WERE TO

03:19:26.220 --> 03:19:29.791
DO IT WOULD NOT WORK. SORRY THE

03:19:29.857 --> 03:19:31.926
REASON BEING THAT OUR STATE IS

03:19:31.993 --> 03:19:33.394
AN ENERGY ISLAND I THINK YOU

03:19:33.461 --> 03:19:34.629
KNOW WE HAVE NO PIPELINES TO

03:19:34.696 --> 03:19:37.365
BRING CRUDE OIL INTO THE STATE

03:19:37.432 --> 03:19:37.932
SO IT ALL COMES IN BY MARIN

03:19:37.999 --> 03:19:40.001
TANKER. WE DON'T HAVE THE

03:19:40.068 --> 03:19:41.703
INFRASTRUCTURE IMPORT CAPACITY

03:19:41.769 --> 03:19:43.771
TO EVEN BEGIN TO IMPORT A 100%

03:19:43.838 --> 03:19:45.106
OF OUR ENERGY AS WE HAVE THIS

03:19:45.173 --> 03:19:47.642
CONVERSATION. SO SINCE THE BAN

03:19:47.709 --> 03:19:48.776
WON'T REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S

03:19:48.843 --> 03:19:50.545
DEMAND FOR ENERGY WITHOUT A

03:19:50.611 --> 03:19:51.746
MASSIVE INCREASE IN IMPORT

03:19:51.813 --> 03:19:53.348
INFRASTRUCTURE IT WOULD LIMIT

03:19:53.414 --> 03:19:55.249
COMMUTE. CONSUMER ACCESS TO

03:19:55.316 --> 03:19:57.285
FUEL AND IT REALLY RESULT IN

03:19:57.352 --> 03:19:59.020
HIGHER ENERGY COSTS. WHEN WE

03:19:59.087 --> 03:20:01.155
LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY

03:20:01.222 --> 03:20:02.924
HERE'S YOUR TYPICAL GAS PUMP.

03:20:02.990 --> 03:20:03.791
BEEN IN NO WAY ARE WE

03:20:03.858 --> 03:20:05.460
SUGGESTING THAT THESE PROGRAMS

03:20:05.526 --> 03:20:07.362
AREN'T MERITORIOUS. I'M ONLY

03:20:07.428 --> 03:20:09.030
SUGGESTING THEY HAVE COST AND

03:20:09.097 --> 03:20:10.698
AFFORDABILITY IMPACTS ON

03:20:10.765 --> 03:20:12.734
CONSUMERS. CERTAINLY THE CAP

03:20:12.800 --> 03:20:14.369
AND TRADE PROGRAM YOU'RE SEEING

03:20:14.435 --> 03:20:15.503
THESE ARE TRACKED BY THE

03:20:15.570 --> 03:20:17.538
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION-

03:20:17.605 --> 03:20:18.973
IS EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR CENTS A

03:20:19.040 --> 03:20:20.775
GALLON YOU SEE LOW CARBON FUEL

03:20:20.842 --> 03:20:22.677
CENTER CREEPING UP OVER TIME.

03:20:22.744 --> 03:20:24.679
AT EIGHTEEN POINT THREE CENT OF

03:20:24.746 --> 03:20:26.547
COURSE THE HIGHEST- STATE TAXES

03:20:26.614 --> 03:20:27.882
ON THE TOP AND FEDERAL TAXES

03:20:27.949 --> 03:20:30.685
AND THEN OTHER- OTHER STATE AND

03:20:30.752 --> 03:20:32.320
LOCAL SALES TAXES AND THEN THE

03:20:32.387 --> 03:20:33.888
UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK

03:20:33.955 --> 03:20:36.190
BECAUSE SO BEFORE WE EVEN. GET

03:20:36.257 --> 03:20:37.458
ANY CRUDE OIL AND FIGURE OUT

03:20:37.525 --> 03:20:38.426
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT TO

03:20:38.493 --> 03:20:39.427
MAKE IT INTO A VALUABLE

03:20:39.494 --> 03:20:42.363
PRODUCT. WHERE THE BUCK EIGHT.

03:20:42.430 --> 03:20:44.432
SO THAT TELLS YOU. JUST

03:20:44.499 --> 03:20:45.733
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS WE

03:20:45.800 --> 03:20:46.868
GO FORWARD IN THESE PROGRAMS

03:20:46.934 --> 03:20:49.003
FROM AFFORDABILITY STANDPOINT.

03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:51.339
THERE ARE. IMPLICATIONS TO

03:20:51.406 --> 03:20:53.040
CONSUMERS FROM THAT AND WE JUST

03:20:53.107 --> 03:20:56.444
NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO

03:20:56.511 --> 03:20:59.514
IN CLOSING- I WOULD JUST LIKE

03:20:59.580 --> 03:21:02.016

CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT EVERYDAY

03:21:30.878 --> 03:21:32.079
CLEANEST BURNING GASOLINE ON

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:33.414
THE PLANET I WAS BACK WHEN WE

03:21:33.481 --> 03:21:35.416

PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND A

03:22:05.913 --> 03:22:08.249
CARBON NEGATIVE WAY. BECAUSE WE

TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND

03:22:12.186 --> 03:22:14.288
THINGS LIKE CCS I THINK WE'VE

03:22:14.355 --> 03:22:16.891
HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CCS

03:22:16.958 --> 03:22:17.992
PREVIOUSLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT

03:22:18.059 --> 03:22:20.995

CC YES AND THE ABILITY OF

03:22:28.169 --> 03:22:30.805
CALIFORNIA GIVEN ITS WONDERFUL

03:22:30.872 --> 03:22:33.040
GEOLOGY TO DO THIS TECHNOLOGY.

03:22:33.107 --> 03:22:34.275
AND IF THEY WILL ALSO KNOWN IN

03:22:34.342 --> 03:22:35.476

03:22:35.543 --> 03:22:36.978
BEFORE FROM THEM IN PREVIOUS

03:22:37.044 --> 03:22:39.313
REPORTS THAT WE CANNOT MEET OUR

03:22:39.380 --> 03:22:41.549
CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS EVEN

03:22:41.616 --> 03:22:44.519
WITH EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING

03:22:44.585 --> 03:22:45.620
WITHOUT CCS PERIOD. I'M GONNA

03:22:45.686 --> 03:22:48.456
DO. SO WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GET ON

03:22:48.523 --> 03:22:50.091
WITH THAT CONVERSATION WHEN I

03:22:50.157 --> 03:22:52.026
WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME A WHEN

03:22:52.093 --> 03:22:53.861
GETS TRADE ASSOCIATION WAS ABLE

03:22:53.928 --> 03:22:55.663
TO VISIT MADRID FOR COP TWENTY

03:22:55.730 --> 03:22:56.597
FIVE SO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO DO

03:22:56.664 --> 03:22:58.699
THAT. SPOKEN THREE PANELS ONE

03:22:58.766 --> 03:23:00.034
OF THEM WAS CCS AND WE WERE

03:23:00.101 --> 03:23:01.469
ABLE TO BRING THE CALIFORNIA

DELEGATION TOGETHER IN MADRID

03:23:03.271 --> 03:23:04.672
WITH EXPERTS TO TALK ABOUT

03:23:04.739 --> 03:23:06.507
THAT. SO WE HAD SECRETARY

03:23:06.574 --> 03:23:08.476
CROWFOOT SECRETARY CHAIRED

03:23:08.543 --> 03:23:11.312
BLUMENFELD AND COMMISSIONER-

03:23:11.379 --> 03:23:12.146
ANDREW MCALLISTER FROM THE

03:23:12.213 --> 03:23:13.814
ENERGY COMMISSION. TALKING

03:23:13.881 --> 03:23:16.083
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO

03:23:16.150 --> 03:23:17.718
DO FOR CCS I JUST WANNA PUT A-

03:23:17.785 --> 03:23:18.686
CCS PLUG IN THERE BECAUSE I

03:23:18.753 --> 03:23:20.588
KNOW THE INVITATION ASKED US TO

03:23:20.655 --> 03:23:21.889
LOOK AT CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS

03:23:21.956 --> 03:23:22.657
THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY

03:23:22.723 --> 03:23:24.191
REALLY CRITICAL. AND WHAT A

03:23:24.258 --> 03:23:26.861
GREAT THING WE CAN ALL DO

03:23:26.928 --> 03:23:27.461
TOGETHER AND WORK ON SOMETHING

03:23:27.528 --> 03:23:29.230
CONSTRUCTIVE. SO WE UNDERSTAND

03:23:29.297 --> 03:23:31.432
THE IMPORTANCE OF BALANCING THE

03:23:31.499 --> 03:23:33.734
ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY. SOCIAL

03:23:33.801 --> 03:23:35.069
JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT ENERGY

03:23:35.136 --> 03:23:37.405
MIX. IT IS MY ASSERTION THAT NO

03:23:37.471 --> 03:23:38.739
POLICY CAN BE SUSTAINABLE

03:23:38.806 --> 03:23:41.442
WITHOUT ALL FOR. CAN'T HAVE ONE

03:23:41.509 --> 03:23:44.645
OR TWO OR THREE YOU NEED ALL

03:23:44.712 --> 03:23:45.279
FOUR SETS SO I LOOK AT POLICIES

03:23:45.346 --> 03:23:48.049
AND JUDGE THEM. AND YOU KNOW IN

03:23:48.115 --> 03:23:49.283
GOOD AND I HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT

03:23:49.350 --> 03:23:51.385
OF- TESTIFYING TOGETHER BEFORE

03:23:51.452 --> 03:23:53.921
AND I THINK- AT KERN COUNTY IS

03:23:53.988 --> 03:23:55.489
HEARING I GOT TO GO AFTER ANGER

03:23:55.556 --> 03:23:57.491
NOT SHE GETS GO AFTER ME SO.

03:23:57.558 --> 03:23:59.427
WORSE FOR FLIP IN. BUT EVEN AT

03:23:59.493 --> 03:24:01.362
THAT HEARING WE- THERE'S THINGS

03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:02.763
WERE NOT GOING TO BRING ON. BUT

03:24:02.830 --> 03:24:03.898
THERE'S ALSO THINGS WE ARE

03:24:03.965 --> 03:24:05.633
GOING TO VERY ON AND I THINK

03:24:05.700 --> 03:24:06.834
THOSE FOR TENANTS ARE PART OF

03:24:06.901 --> 03:24:08.869
THAT. AND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE

03:24:08.936 --> 03:24:10.805
A STRONG ECONOMY AND A STRONG

03:24:10.871 --> 03:24:12.640
ENVIRONMENT AND DEAL WITH OUR-

03:24:12.707 --> 03:24:14.675
SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND AGAIN

03:24:14.742 --> 03:24:15.509
SIX SEVENTEENS A WONDERFUL

03:24:15.576 --> 03:24:17.111
PROGRAM. AND THEN WHAT IS THAT

03:24:17.178 --> 03:24:19.380
ENERGY MIX REALLY LOOK LIKE AS

03:24:19.447 --> 03:24:21.616

AND WE MAY NOT SIR WE MAY NOT

03:24:27.321 --> 03:24:29.357
SHARE SOMETIMES THE SAME

03:24:29.423 --> 03:24:29.924
POLITICS BUT WE DO SHARE THE

03:24:29.991 --> 03:24:31.993
SAME FUTURE. AND I STRONGLY

PEOPLE ARE PROSPERITY AND

03:24:35.162 --> 03:24:37.031
FRANKLY OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS A

03:24:37.098 --> 03:24:38.699
SUSTAINABLE FUTURE DEPENDS ON

03:24:38.766 --> 03:24:40.234

03:24:55.416 --> 03:24:57.318
IMPORTANT TOPIC IN AN IMPORTANT

03:24:57.385 --> 03:24:58.919
TOPIC FOR MY ORGANIZATION WHICH

03:24:58.986 --> 03:24:59.754
IS THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY

03:24:59.820 --> 03:25:01.522
THE ENVIRONMENT A WE ARE BASED

03:25:01.589 --> 03:25:03.591
IN KERN COUNTY- AND YOU CAN'T

03:25:03.658 --> 03:25:04.992
HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

03:25:05.059 --> 03:25:06.761
FUTURE OF OIL AND GAS WITHOUT

03:25:06.827 --> 03:25:07.928
ALSO BEING A CONVERSATION ABOUT

03:25:07.995 --> 03:25:09.797
CURRENT I WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH

03:25:09.864 --> 03:25:10.431
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:13.501
COMMUNITIES ON AND WE'RE-

03:25:13.567 --> 03:25:14.835
GETTING OUR DIRECTIVES FROM

03:25:14.902 --> 03:25:17.738
THEM- SO IT IS THE RESIDENT OF

03:25:17.805 --> 03:25:19.006
KERN COUNTY WHO LIVE IN THE

03:25:19.073 --> 03:25:20.875
MIDST OF OIL AND GAS DRILLING-

03:25:20.941 --> 03:25:22.843
WHO ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A

03:25:22.910 --> 03:25:25.646
PROBLEM. ON THAT THESE HAVE

03:25:25.713 --> 03:25:27.548
HEALTH IMPACTS AND THIS IS WHAT

03:25:27.615 --> 03:25:28.983
OUR ORGANIZATION NEEDS TO

03:25:29.050 --> 03:25:29.884
PRIORITIZE AND THAT'S WHY I'M

03:25:29.950 --> 03:25:31.352
SITTING HERE TODAY I'M I ALSO

03:25:31.419 --> 03:25:35.690
HAVE A POWER POINT WHICH I WILL.

03:25:35.756 --> 03:25:38.059
SHARE WITH YOU SO THE- THIS IS

03:25:38.125 --> 03:25:39.760
A AT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

03:25:39.827 --> 03:25:42.663
PERSPECTIVE. ON TRANSITIONING

03:25:42.730 --> 03:25:43.264
THE WORK FORCE ENVIRONMENT AND

03:25:43.330 --> 03:25:45.733
ECONOMY. IN KERN COUNTY AND SO

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.501
I DO WANT TO START WITH SAYING

03:25:47.568 --> 03:25:50.404
YES WE HAVE SHARED GOALS-

03:25:50.471 --> 03:25:52.273
ESPECIALLY WITH THE LABOR FORCE

03:25:52.339 --> 03:25:55.710
ON IN KERN COUNTY- WE WANT A

03:25:55.776 --> 03:25:56.877
THRIVING A PROSPEROUS LOCAL

03:25:56.944 --> 03:25:58.279
ECONOMY WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE

03:25:58.345 --> 03:26:00.281
KERN COUNTY DECIMATED. WE WANT

03:26:00.347 --> 03:26:03.117
GOOD WELL PAYING AND SAFE JOBS.

03:26:03.184 --> 03:26:05.119
ARE WE ALSO WANT HEALTHY PLACES

03:26:05.186 --> 03:26:07.254
TO LIVE WORK PLAY AND PRAY. WE

03:26:07.321 --> 03:26:09.323
WANT INVESTED AN INCREASE

03:26:09.390 --> 03:26:10.624
INVESTMENT IN KERN COUNTY WHICH

03:26:10.691 --> 03:26:11.792
HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND SO

03:26:11.859 --> 03:26:13.761
MANY DIFFERENT AREAS I'M AND

03:26:13.828 --> 03:26:16.063
AGAIN I THINK YOU TALK TO OIL

03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:17.531
AND GAS WORKERS THEY WOULD SAY

03:26:17.598 --> 03:26:19.734
THE SAME THING SO WE ARE COMING

03:26:19.800 --> 03:26:22.436
FROM A PLACE OF SHARED GOALS-

03:26:22.503 --> 03:26:23.671
EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE PROBABLY

03:26:23.738 --> 03:26:24.839
DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE OF

03:26:24.905 --> 03:26:26.941
OPINIONS ON HOW TO.GET THERE.

03:26:27.007 --> 03:26:29.376
ARM ONE THING ONE PROMISE THAT

03:26:29.443 --> 03:26:32.012
I'D LIKE TO START WITH. ARM IS

03:26:32.079 --> 03:26:33.547
THAT AS WE FIGHT NOW TO PROTECT

03:26:33.614 --> 03:26:35.416
THE STATUS SOME SECTORS ARE

03:26:35.483 --> 03:26:36.717
FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE STATUS

03:26:36.784 --> 03:26:39.253
QUO. AND KERN COUNTY- I WOULD

03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:40.588
ARGUE AND SUBMIT THAT THE

03:26:40.654 --> 03:26:42.623
STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH-

03:26:42.690 --> 03:26:44.525
KERN COUNTY IS A- FAIRLY NON

03:26:44.592 --> 03:26:46.627
DIVERSE ECONOMY IT IS. VERY

03:26:46.694 --> 03:26:47.762
DEPENDENT ON BOTH OIL AND GAS

03:26:47.828 --> 03:26:49.697
EXTRACTION ON AND CONVENTIONAL

03:26:49.764 --> 03:26:52.633
AGRICULTURE. ON THIS AS YOU

03:26:52.700 --> 03:26:55.102
KNOW DESPITE THE WEALTH OF

03:26:55.169 --> 03:26:57.838
THESE RESOURCES IN KERN COUNTY-

03:26:57.905 --> 03:26:58.906
YOU DO SEE VERY HIGH

03:26:58.973 --> 03:27:00.808
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES- EVEN THOUGH

03:27:00.875 --> 03:27:02.376
THE IT HAS BEEN REDUCE IT IS

03:27:02.443 --> 03:27:05.179
STILL. ON THE NOT QUITE DOUBLE-

03:27:05.246 --> 03:27:07.181
THE STATE AVERAGE. ARE YOU HAVE

03:27:07.248 --> 03:27:10.017
HIGH RATES OF POVERTY- TWENTY

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:11.952
TWO PER. POINT 6% VERSUS THE

03:27:12.019 --> 03:27:14.789
CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN PERCENT- AND

03:27:14.855 --> 03:27:17.625
WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT- BECAUSE

03:27:17.691 --> 03:27:18.826
THE ECONOMY IS SO HIGHLY

03:27:18.893 --> 03:27:20.361
DEPENDENT ON A NATURALLY

03:27:20.427 --> 03:27:21.462
DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS

03:27:21.529 --> 03:27:24.465
INDUSTRY- THESE- THESE

03:27:24.532 --> 03:27:26.801
STATUSES. CAN ONLY ARE AT RISK

03:27:26.867 --> 03:27:27.768
OF GETTING MUCH WORSE AND WE

03:27:27.835 --> 03:27:30.704
CAN ONLY. LOOK BACK TO TWENTY

03:27:30.771 --> 03:27:31.939
FOURTEEN WHEN THE OIL AND GAS.

03:27:32.006 --> 03:27:35.309
OIL PRICES DROPPED- AND WE SAW

03:27:35.376 --> 03:27:37.444
A VERY LARGE IMPACTS TO THE

03:27:37.511 --> 03:27:43.184
LOCAL ECONOMY- SO IT IS.

03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:43.884
VULNERABLE TO THE OIL AND GAS

03:27:43.951 --> 03:27:48.155
INDUSTRY THE FUNCTION. THEIR.

03:27:48.222 --> 03:27:50.524
SO THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE

03:27:50.591 --> 03:27:53.227
IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE SEEN A

03:27:53.294 --> 03:27:55.262
56% DECLINE IN OIL GAS

03:27:55.329 --> 03:27:57.565
PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:27:57.631 --> 03:27:59.333
THAT'S IS ONLY EXPECTED TO

03:27:59.400 --> 03:28:01.035
CONTINUE- I THINK THE

03:28:01.101 --> 03:28:02.703
PROJECTIONS ARE ANOTHER 26% IN

03:28:02.770 --> 03:28:05.372
THE NEXT DECADE. AND THESE

03:28:05.439 --> 03:28:08.042
PROJECTIONS I BASED ON CURRENT

03:28:08.108 --> 03:28:10.010
CONDITIONS THIS IS NOT ACCOUNT

03:28:10.077 --> 03:28:11.078
FOR ANY REGULATORY OR

03:28:11.145 --> 03:28:13.080
UNEXPECTED MARKET CHANGES SO WE

03:28:13.147 --> 03:28:16.584
KNOW OF REGARDLESS OF THAT KERN

03:28:16.650 --> 03:28:19.019
COUNTY AND CALIFORNIA IS GOING

03:28:19.086 --> 03:28:20.321
TO BE DECLINING IN ITS

03:28:20.387 --> 03:28:21.789
PRODUCTION AND THAT HOUSE

03:28:21.856 --> 03:28:24.558
IMPACTS ON ECONOMIES AND

03:28:24.625 --> 03:28:25.092
WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO

03:28:25.159 --> 03:28:28.562
ADDRESS REGARDLESS. SO. WHY IS

03:28:28.629 --> 03:28:30.464
THE OIL FILL OR PRODUCTION

03:28:30.531 --> 03:28:33.667
DECLINING. FRANKLY THE FIELDS

03:28:33.734 --> 03:28:36.837
ARE OLD AND THE OIL IS HEAVY.

03:28:36.904 --> 03:28:39.773
I'M SO WHILE THERE'S A SHALE

03:28:39.840 --> 03:28:41.809
OIL BOOMS IN OTHER PLACES LIKE

03:28:41.876 --> 03:28:45.446
TEXAS LIKE NORTH DAKOTA-

03:28:45.512 --> 03:28:47.414
CALIFORNIA COULD IS MORE

03:28:47.481 --> 03:28:50.384
EXPENSIVE TO EXTRACT ACCRUED

03:28:50.451 --> 03:28:52.853
WEIGHTS ARE COMPARABLE TO THE

03:28:52.920 --> 03:28:54.922
TAR SANDS IN CANADA. SO IN

03:28:54.989 --> 03:28:55.956
TERMS OF GETTING UP OUT OF THE

03:28:56.023 --> 03:28:57.758
WATER WE DO NEED TO HAVE A

03:28:57.825 --> 03:28:59.093
STEAM INJECTIONS IN ORDER TO

03:28:59.159 --> 03:29:00.394
EAT IT UP OTHERWISE THE

03:29:00.461 --> 03:29:01.662
CONSISTENCY IS MORE LIKE PEANUT

03:29:01.729 --> 03:29:03.797
BUTTER ON SO WHEN YOU COMPARE

03:29:03.864 --> 03:29:05.766
THAT TO OTHER AREAS ARE THERE

03:29:05.833 --> 03:29:08.869
IS A RELATIVE DISINCENTIVE I'M

03:29:08.936 --> 03:29:10.504
AND LESS PROFITABILITY FOR THE

03:29:10.571 --> 03:29:12.573
OIL AND GAS COMPANIES. TO DRILL

03:29:12.640 --> 03:29:15.943
HERE. IT ALSO MEANS THAT

03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:17.378
CALIFORNIA'S CREEK CALIFORNIA'S

03:29:17.444 --> 03:29:19.313
CRUDE IS SOME OF THE MOST

03:29:19.380 --> 03:29:21.916
HIGHLY IMPACTFUL TO CLIMATE UP

03:29:21.982 --> 03:29:24.718
COMPARED TO UP FEELS FOUND

03:29:24.785 --> 03:29:27.488
OTHER OTHER PLACES. SO KERN IS

03:29:27.554 --> 03:29:28.722
GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE

03:29:28.789 --> 03:29:30.791
PRODUCTION DECLINED REGARDLESS

03:29:30.858 --> 03:29:32.693
OF ANY OTHER FACTORS THERE'S NO

03:29:32.760 --> 03:29:34.728
CHANGING THE AGE OF THE FIELDS

03:29:34.795 --> 03:29:36.964
AND THERE'S NO CHANGING THE

03:29:37.031 --> 03:29:41.168
QUALITY OF OUR CREATED. SO WHAT

03:29:41.235 --> 03:29:43.504
DOES THIS MEAN FOR KERN'S WORK

03:29:43.570 --> 03:29:45.539
FORCE. WELL HERE THIS IS THAT

03:29:45.606 --> 03:29:46.674
THESE ARE NUMBERS TO FROM A

03:29:46.740 --> 03:29:49.510
RECENT WITH BY REPORT ON.

03:29:49.576 --> 03:29:52.413
SHOWING THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF

03:29:52.479 --> 03:29:53.447
PRODUCTION JOBS BECAUSE I THINK

03:29:53.514 --> 03:29:55.282
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL

03:29:55.349 --> 03:29:56.450
HAVE SOME SHARED UNDERSTANDINGS

03:29:56.517 --> 03:29:58.118
OF THE JOBS THAT ARE AT STAKE

03:29:58.185 --> 03:29:58.752
AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF

03:29:58.819 --> 03:30:00.287
ELEVATED FIGURES. ARE COMING

03:30:00.354 --> 03:30:02.790
OUT AND SO I DECIDED TO TAKE

03:30:02.856 --> 03:30:04.959
WAS WAS NUMBERS- I THINK

03:30:05.025 --> 03:30:06.293
THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN SOME MORE

03:30:06.360 --> 03:30:07.895
DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE NUMBERS.

03:30:07.962 --> 03:30:09.596
ALSO HERE AGAIN WE SEE WHAT THE

03:30:09.663 --> 03:30:12.066
NATURAL DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS

03:30:12.132 --> 03:30:13.701
PRODUCTION WE ARE GOING TO SEE.

03:30:13.767 --> 03:30:15.102
REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF JOBS

03:30:15.169 --> 03:30:16.971
AVAILABLE. ON SO THAT THIS IS

03:30:17.037 --> 03:30:20.441
HAPPENING. I'M I WILL SAY THAT

03:30:20.507 --> 03:30:21.675
A LOT OF THE JOBS FIGURES THAT

03:30:21.742 --> 03:30:23.711
WE SEE ON A COMING FOR THE OIL

03:30:23.777 --> 03:30:25.913
GAS INDUSTRY ACCOUNT FOR RETAIL

03:30:25.980 --> 03:30:28.849
GESTATION JOBS- AND I THINK AS

03:30:28.916 --> 03:30:29.383
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE

03:30:29.450 --> 03:30:31.085
DIFFERENT REGULATORY PROCESSES.

03:30:31.151 --> 03:30:32.519
WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL

03:30:32.586 --> 03:30:34.755
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:30:34.822 --> 03:30:35.289
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:30:35.356 --> 03:30:40.828
MANAGE DECLINE. TOM SO WE

03:30:40.894 --> 03:30:42.363
ALREADY NEED TO ENSURE THAT

03:30:42.429 --> 03:30:44.098
THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF JOB

03:30:44.164 --> 03:30:45.866
REPLACEMENT FOR KERN COUNTY

03:30:45.933 --> 03:30:48.669
AGAIN REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER

03:30:48.736 --> 03:30:52.439
ADDITIONAL FACTORS. SO THIS IS

03:30:52.506 --> 03:30:54.908
THE OF COMPASS A GRAPH OF A

03:30:54.975 --> 03:30:56.577
COMPOSITION OF THE AGE AND I

03:30:56.643 --> 03:30:59.213
THINK THIS IS REALLY TELLING ON

03:30:59.279 --> 03:30:59.980
THIS ACTUALLY FOUR COLUMNS

03:31:00.047 --> 03:31:02.349
HERE. THE FIRST COLUMN IS A

03:31:02.416 --> 03:31:04.385
TINY BLUE FLAVOR WHICH

03:31:04.451 --> 03:31:07.154
REPRESENTS WORK- WORKERS JUST

03:31:07.221 --> 03:31:09.356
ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. AT

03:31:09.423 --> 03:31:11.692
UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO. SO

03:31:11.759 --> 03:31:14.261
WECAN SEE THAT WE'RE NOT

03:31:14.328 --> 03:31:17.064
GETTING NEW YOUNG WORKERS

03:31:17.131 --> 03:31:19.333
ENTERING INTO THE FIELD- AND

03:31:19.400 --> 03:31:22.536
CONVERSELY WE CAN SEE THAT OVER

03:31:22.603 --> 03:31:25.672
77% OF THE WORK FORCE IS OVER

03:31:25.739 --> 03:31:27.207
THIRTY FIVE AND OVER QUARTER IS

03:31:27.274 --> 03:31:29.143
OVER FIFTY FIVE SO THAT'S

03:31:29.209 --> 03:31:30.444
ACTUALLY VERY GOOD NEWS FOR

03:31:30.511 --> 03:31:33.814
KERN COUNTY- AS- A SIZEABLE

03:31:33.881 --> 03:31:36.717
PERCENT OF THE WORK FORCE-

03:31:36.784 --> 03:31:38.986
WILL. THE SORRY THE WORKFORCE I

03:31:39.053 --> 03:31:41.188
TRANSITION NEEDS CAN BE OFFSET

03:31:41.255 --> 03:31:43.924
BY THE OLDER WORKERS LEAVING

03:31:43.991 --> 03:31:46.493
THE WORK FORCE OVERTIME. THIS

03:31:46.560 --> 03:31:47.694
IS JUST ANOTHER GRAPH SHOWING

03:31:47.761 --> 03:31:49.630
THE SAME THING BUT SHOWING THAT

03:31:49.696 --> 03:31:52.066
THIS TRAJECTORY. HAS HAS BEEN

03:31:52.132 --> 03:31:53.867
INCREASING OVER THE TIME SO AS

03:31:53.934 --> 03:31:55.636
THE YEARS GO BY WE HAVE FEWER

03:31:55.702 --> 03:31:56.904
AND FEWER YOUNG PERSON PEOPLE

03:31:56.970 --> 03:31:58.405
ENTERING THE FIELD AND WE SEE

03:31:58.472 --> 03:31:59.807
HIGHER AND HIGHER PERCENTAGES

03:31:59.873 --> 03:32:02.643
OF OLDER WORKERS SO IN TERMS OF

03:32:02.709 --> 03:32:03.444
THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE

03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:06.280
WORKFORCE. WE AGREE THAT WE

03:32:06.346 --> 03:32:08.182
NEED TO HAVE GOOD JOBS-

03:32:08.248 --> 03:32:10.684
HOWEVER- IN TERMS OF HOW

03:32:10.751 --> 03:32:11.885
PAINFUL THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR

03:32:11.952 --> 03:32:13.253
CURRENT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE

03:32:13.320 --> 03:32:16.056
WOULD HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS.

03:32:16.123 --> 03:32:20.994
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE COST OF

03:32:21.061 --> 03:32:22.496
LOSING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION

03:32:22.563 --> 03:32:24.631
WE NEED TO COMPARE THAT TO THE

03:32:24.698 --> 03:32:26.266
HEALTH COSTS THAT WE HAVE NOW

03:32:26.333 --> 03:32:27.167
WITH THE CURRENT PRODUCTION

03:32:27.234 --> 03:32:28.969
RATES ARE SO HERE'S JUST A

03:32:29.036 --> 03:32:32.773
QUICK. A GRAPH ON THIS JUST

03:32:32.840 --> 03:32:35.909
SHOWS OF THE DIFFERENCE IN

03:32:35.976 --> 03:32:37.211
CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY

03:32:37.277 --> 03:32:39.046
DISEASE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA SO

03:32:39.113 --> 03:32:41.081
WE CAN SEE KERN COUNTY JUST

03:32:41.148 --> 03:32:42.916
ASTRONOMICALLY ABOVE ANY OTHER

03:32:42.983 --> 03:32:44.952
COUNTY OF THESE ILLNESSES

03:32:45.018 --> 03:32:47.354
INCLUDE THINGS LIKE OUT SOME

03:32:47.421 --> 03:32:48.722
THERE IS A AMAZING STATISTIC

03:32:48.789 --> 03:32:50.124
THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY THIRTY

03:32:50.190 --> 03:32:51.358
SEVEN PEOPLE IN CURRENT DIED

03:32:51.425 --> 03:32:52.426
FROM CHRONIC RESPIRATORY

03:32:52.493 --> 03:32:54.027
DISEASE BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN

03:32:54.094 --> 03:32:56.797
AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS IS

03:32:56.864 --> 03:32:57.397
TWELVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE

03:32:57.464 --> 03:33:00.267
REST OF THE STATE- ASTHMA COSTS

03:33:00.334 --> 03:33:02.970
KERN COUNTY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED

03:33:03.036 --> 03:33:04.204
MILLION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS

03:33:04.271 --> 03:33:05.205
AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY EVERY

03:33:05.272 --> 03:33:07.274
YEAR AND RECENTLY WE JUST SAW

03:33:07.341 --> 03:33:08.775
ANOTHER STUDY THAT CAME OUT

03:33:08.842 --> 03:33:10.177
SHOWING THAT DIRTY AIR. COST

03:33:10.244 --> 03:33:12.379
CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TWENTY EIGHT

03:33:12.446 --> 03:33:14.414
BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY SO WE

03:33:14.481 --> 03:33:16.250
NEED TO HAVE A HOLISTIC-

03:33:16.316 --> 03:33:19.486
PICTURE OF THE COST OF OIL AND

03:33:19.553 --> 03:33:21.889
GAS PRODUCTION. I'M HERE SOME

03:33:21.955 --> 03:33:23.323
QUICK FLY JUST SHOWING THE

03:33:23.390 --> 03:33:26.126
RELATIVE- CONTRIBUTION OF OIL

03:33:26.193 --> 03:33:27.327
AND GAS SO EVERYTHING YOU SEE

03:33:27.394 --> 03:33:28.962
THERE A WITH THE RED STRIPES

03:33:29.029 --> 03:33:30.664
THAT'S OIL AND GAS-

03:33:30.731 --> 03:33:31.865
CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS IS A

03:33:31.932 --> 03:33:33.367
MEASUREMENT OF. A TOXIC AIR

03:33:33.433 --> 03:33:35.302
CONTAMINANTS OF OIL AND GAS

03:33:35.369 --> 03:33:36.937
ACTIVITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:33:37.004 --> 03:33:38.739
BETWEEN THIRTY AND 60% OF TACK

03:33:38.805 --> 03:33:40.374
EMISSIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

03:33:40.440 --> 03:33:42.843
VALLEY. NOT THAT THAT LARGE ONE

03:33:42.910 --> 03:33:45.078
IS FROM ALL THE HIDE FOR

03:33:45.145 --> 03:33:49.249
EXAMPLE. OIL AND GAS FACILITIES

03:33:49.316 --> 03:33:50.684
ARE ALSO THE LARGEST STATIONARY

03:33:50.751 --> 03:33:52.786
SOURCES OF DIRECT PM TWO POINT

03:33:52.853 --> 03:33:53.987
FIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.

03:33:54.054 --> 03:33:56.390
JUST FOR CORPORATIONS CHEVRON

03:33:56.456 --> 03:33:58.692
AIR ENERGY BERRY PETROLEUM AND

03:33:58.759 --> 03:34:00.794
PLANES. EXPLORATION ACCOUNT FOR

03:34:00.861 --> 03:34:03.063
HALF. OF ALL PM TWO POINT FIVE

03:34:03.130 --> 03:34:04.498
EMISSIONS FROM LARGE STATIONARY

03:34:04.565 --> 03:34:06.400
SOURCES IN THE VALLEY. OF FOR

03:34:06.466 --> 03:34:08.068
COMPARISON THIS IS MORE DIRECT

03:34:08.135 --> 03:34:09.336
PM TWO POINT FIVE THAN IT IS

03:34:09.403 --> 03:34:10.871
PRODUCED BY ALL PASSENGER

03:34:10.938 --> 03:34:13.040
VEHICLES AND LIGHT AND MEDIUM

03:34:13.106 --> 03:34:17.477
DUTY TRUCKS COMBINED. WE ALSO

03:34:17.544 --> 03:34:20.214
NEED TO CONSIDER COST TO WATER.

03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:22.616
ON THE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE

03:34:22.683 --> 03:34:25.152
STATE WATER BOARD FOUND THAT

03:34:25.219 --> 03:34:26.920
WATER SUPPLY WELLS IN KERN HAVE.

03:34:26.987 --> 03:34:28.989
OIL INDUSTRY POLLUTANTS- IN

03:34:29.056 --> 03:34:31.124
THEM. THERE'S ALSO BEEN RECENT

03:34:31.191 --> 03:34:32.192
STUDIES SHOWING INCREASED

03:34:32.259 --> 03:34:35.462
SALINITY. I DID A PRODUCED OUT

03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:37.397
WASTEWATER DISPOSAL AND KERN

03:34:37.464 --> 03:34:40.767
OIL FIELDS. IN ADDITION TO THE

03:34:40.834 --> 03:34:41.935
WATER CONTAMINATION WE ALSO

03:34:42.002 --> 03:34:44.905
HAVE- THE HIVE WATER USE- IN

03:34:44.972 --> 03:34:50.611
CALIFORNIA. UP STUDIES DO LINK

03:34:50.677 --> 03:34:52.279
APPROXIMATE OIL AND GAS WELLS

03:34:52.346 --> 03:34:53.814
TO HOST OF HEALTH IMPACTS

03:34:53.880 --> 03:34:54.681
INCLUDING INCREASE WITH OF

03:34:54.748 --> 03:34:56.350
ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY

03:34:56.416 --> 03:34:58.452
ILLNESSES PREMATURE DEATHS HIGH

03:34:58.518 --> 03:35:02.689
RISK PREGNANCY AND CANCER- THE

03:35:02.756 --> 03:35:04.725
CLOSER PEOPLE LIVE TO OIL AND

03:35:04.791 --> 03:35:06.326
GAS WELLS THE MORE LIKELY THEY

03:35:06.393 --> 03:35:07.894
WILL BE EXPOSED TO TOXIC AIR

03:35:07.961 --> 03:35:08.895
CONTAMINANTS LIKE WE JUST

03:35:08.962 --> 03:35:10.197
DISCUSSED. ON AND THE MORE

03:35:10.264 --> 03:35:12.032
ELEVATED THE RISK ASSOCIATED

03:35:12.099 --> 03:35:13.634
HEALTH EFFECTS AND OF COURSE

03:35:13.700 --> 03:35:17.571
CHILDREN- ARE THE MOST

03:35:17.638 --> 03:35:20.274
SENSITIVE POPULATIONS I TO

03:35:20.340 --> 03:35:26.647
THESE OIL AND GAS WELLS. SO WE

03:35:26.713 --> 03:35:29.650
NEED A JUST TRANSITION. ARM WE

03:35:29.716 --> 03:35:31.718
NEED THIS JUST TRANSITION TO BE

03:35:31.785 --> 03:35:33.854
LED BY WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES

03:35:33.920 --> 03:35:36.757
THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. WE NEED

03:35:36.823 --> 03:35:39.526
TO DO OF WHAT WORKERS NEED TO

03:35:39.593 --> 03:35:42.362
FEEL WHOLE. ARM AND WE NEED TO

03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:43.430
MAKE SURE THAT BENEFITS ACCRUE

03:35:43.497 --> 03:35:45.165
TO THE COMMUNITY SO I THINK

03:35:45.232 --> 03:35:51.238
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. MISTAKES

03:35:51.305 --> 03:35:53.907
MISTAKES MADE IN TERMS OF THE

03:35:53.974 --> 03:35:55.042
OF THE JUST TRANSITION

03:35:55.108 --> 03:35:56.376
CONVERSATION BECAUSE WORKERS

03:35:56.443 --> 03:35:57.644
HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH AT THE

03:35:57.711 --> 03:35:59.546
TABLE MOM AND I THINK IT'S

03:35:59.613 --> 03:36:00.847
GOTTEN A BAD RAP FRANKLY AT

03:36:00.914 --> 03:36:02.149
THIS POINT AND SO I THINK WE

03:36:02.215 --> 03:36:03.383
NEED TO RE BRAND JUST

03:36:03.450 --> 03:36:04.151
TRANSITION AND DO IT RIGHT IN

03:36:04.217 --> 03:36:05.686
CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO

03:36:05.752 --> 03:36:07.754
START IN KERN COUNTY- AND I

03:36:07.821 --> 03:36:09.222
THINK THAT STARTS WITH LET'S

03:36:09.289 --> 03:36:10.891
TALK TO LABOR AND THAT HAVE THE

03:36:10.957 --> 03:36:12.259
BE CENTRAL AS WELL AS THE

03:36:12.326 --> 03:36:13.593
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THERE IN

03:36:13.660 --> 03:36:15.896
TERMS OF WHAT DO THEY NEED. TO

03:36:15.962 --> 03:36:17.998
FEEL LIKE THEY ARE OKAY-

03:36:18.065 --> 03:36:20.634
TRANSITIONING TO A NEW JOB AND

03:36:20.701 --> 03:36:25.339
A AND A- THE NEW ECONOMY. I IN

03:36:25.405 --> 03:36:27.407
KERN COUNTY THERE ARE

03:36:27.474 --> 03:36:29.042
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE

03:36:29.109 --> 03:36:30.377
HORIZON FOR ONE WE SEE A

03:36:30.444 --> 03:36:32.813
YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC AS- HOUSING

03:36:32.879 --> 03:36:34.614
PRICES RISE ACROSS THE STATE

03:36:34.681 --> 03:36:36.350
WERE SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE RETURN

03:36:36.416 --> 03:36:38.051
AFTER COLLEGE WHICH WASN'T

03:36:38.118 --> 03:36:39.820
DIDN'T USED TO BE THE CASE SO

03:36:39.886 --> 03:36:40.787
HAVING MORE YOUNG AT COLLEGE

03:36:40.854 --> 03:36:42.823
EDUCATED OF PEOPLE MOVING IN WE

03:36:42.889 --> 03:36:45.025
SING A REVITALIZATION OF

03:36:45.092 --> 03:36:45.959
DOWNTOWN WE'RE SEEING HOTEL

03:36:46.026 --> 03:36:47.828
GROWTH- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT

03:36:47.894 --> 03:36:50.130
OF RENEWABLE ENERGY A BIT WISE

03:36:50.197 --> 03:36:52.532
IS A FLEDGLING TECH COMPANY-

03:36:52.599 --> 03:36:53.433
THERE'S ONE IN FRESNO NOW

03:36:53.500 --> 03:36:55.635
THERE'S ONE IN BAKERSFIELD- SO

03:36:55.702 --> 03:36:57.037
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE

03:36:57.104 --> 03:36:59.206
HAVE IN KERN COUNTY- WE ALSO

03:36:59.272 --> 03:37:00.974
HAVE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

03:37:01.041 --> 03:37:03.343
ABANDONED. AND ORPHANED WELLS

03:37:03.410 --> 03:37:05.612
THERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITIES

03:37:05.679 --> 03:37:07.247
FOR SOIL REMEDIATION AND CLEAN

03:37:07.314 --> 03:37:08.348
UP WELL ABANDONMENT AND

03:37:08.415 --> 03:37:10.851
PLUGGING ON AS WELL AS- WE NEED

03:37:10.917 --> 03:37:13.153
TO LOOK AT PROPERTY TAXES ON

03:37:13.220 --> 03:37:15.922
NEWLY EMERGING SECTORS. SO JUST

03:37:15.989 --> 03:37:17.758
TO. UP FINISH UP WE NEED TO

03:37:17.824 --> 03:37:18.925
CREATE A JUST TRANSITION AND

03:37:18.992 --> 03:37:21.194
KERN COUNTY. AND WE NEED TO

03:37:21.261 --> 03:37:22.462
DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT STATE

03:37:22.529 --> 03:37:24.431
FUNDS- TO HELP RESIDENTS

03:37:24.498 --> 03:37:25.999
BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES TAKE

03:37:26.066 --> 03:37:27.033
ADVANTAGE OF THESE EMERGING

03:37:27.100 --> 03:37:29.569
OPPORTUNITIES- AND WE NEED TO

03:37:29.636 --> 03:37:31.705
DO AN ANALYSIS. OF THE ASSETS

03:37:31.772 --> 03:37:33.306
IN OPPORTUNITIES TO DIVERSIFY

03:37:33.373 --> 03:37:36.810
THE ECONOMY- THE TAKE AWAY AS

03:37:36.877 --> 03:37:38.345
THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM OIL

03:37:38.412 --> 03:37:38.879
AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA IS

03:37:38.945 --> 03:37:40.781
INEVITABLE. AND IF WE DON'T

03:37:40.847 --> 03:37:41.915
PLAN FOR IT AND IT'S NOT

03:37:41.982 --> 03:37:43.750
MANAGED KERN COUNTY IS GOING TO

03:37:43.817 --> 03:37:45.185
BE LEFT BEHIND AND THE ECONOMY

03:37:45.252 --> 03:37:48.288
IS GOING TO BE DECIMATED- RIGHT

03:37:48.355 --> 03:37:49.990
NOW I THINK KERN COUNTY HAS AN

03:37:50.056 --> 03:37:51.792
OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THE

03:37:51.858 --> 03:37:53.894
STATE TO BRING IT TO BRING IN

03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:56.463
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON AND

03:37:56.530 --> 03:37:58.865
REALLY OPEN THE DOORS TO A

03:37:58.932 --> 03:37:59.433
BETTER FUTURE FOR CAR. THANK

YEAH THE GRAVITY OF THE HEALTH

03:38:18.919 --> 03:38:22.556
CHALLENGE AND- SO BRING

03:38:22.622 --> 03:38:25.592
INFORMATION LIKE WISE ON. OUR

03:38:25.659 --> 03:38:29.396
PATROLLING ADDICTION. I ALWAYS

03:38:29.463 --> 03:38:31.598
USE YET THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER

03:38:31.665 --> 03:38:32.132
OF PETROLEUM IN THE WORLD

03:38:32.199 --> 03:38:33.967
ALTHOUGH. I THINK THE

03:38:34.034 --> 03:38:35.202
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MIGHT BE

03:38:35.268 --> 03:38:36.203
DISPENSED TERMS OF

03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:40.640
JURISDICTIONS OF. BUT WERE.

03:38:40.707 --> 03:38:45.245
WE'RE WE'RE VERY DEEPLY.

03:38:45.312 --> 03:38:47.414
EMBEDDED IN THIS PROBLEM- I

03:39:07.267 --> 03:39:09.202
BACKLOG ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT

THIS LAST WEEK BUT. JUST HOW TO

03:39:15.509 --> 03:39:17.110
ACTUALLY BUILD TRUST IN THE

03:39:17.177 --> 03:39:20.046
COMMUNITY RIGHT AND- ESPECIALLY

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:21.481
WHEN THE SORT OF. WHEN IT GETS

03:39:21.548 --> 03:39:24.918
REALLY INTIMATE. ARE YOU HAVE

EFFORTS TO BEEF UP THE AGENCIES

03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:37.497

AGENCY FUNCTIONAL WHICH SEEMS

03:39:49.376 --> 03:39:50.443
BEYOND THIS SORT OF LARGER

03:39:50.510 --> 03:39:51.778
QUESTION OF HOW THE FOSSIL FUEL

03:39:51.845 --> 03:39:53.914
FUTURE GOES. INTO THERE'S

03:39:53.980 --> 03:39:55.148
PRETTY COMMON INTEREST IN

03:39:55.215 --> 03:39:56.716
HAVING A FUNCTIONAL AGENCY

03:39:56.783 --> 03:39:59.252
THERE SO. COMMENTS ON THAT

03:39:59.319 --> 03:40:01.388
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION YEAH-

03:40:01.454 --> 03:40:04.257
AND YES WE CERTAINLY AND HAVE I

03:40:04.324 --> 03:40:05.292
THINK YOU CAN LOOK IN OUR

03:40:05.358 --> 03:40:06.660
HISTORY THIS ISN'T THE FIRST

03:40:06.726 --> 03:40:08.929
BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO INCREASE

03:40:08.995 --> 03:40:10.664
RESOURCES CORRECT- AT THAT

03:40:10.730 --> 03:40:12.599
APARTMENT SO I THINK WE DON'T

03:40:12.666 --> 03:40:14.668
WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT MAKING

03:40:14.734 --> 03:40:16.303
SURE THAT THE AGENCY HAS THE

03:40:16.369 --> 03:40:19.172
RESOURCES IT NEEDS. TO RE

03:40:19.239 --> 03:40:20.941
ESTABLISH ITS CREDIBILITY AND

03:40:21.007 --> 03:40:23.643
TO CONTINUE THIS ENERGY PATHWAY

03:40:23.710 --> 03:40:25.745
THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE FOR

03:40:25.812 --> 03:40:26.379
THE PRODUCTION OF OUR CRUDE OIL

03:40:26.446 --> 03:40:28.548
HERE LOCALLY. AND OUR ABILITY

03:40:28.615 --> 03:40:31.418
TO REFINE IT SO- I DO WANT TO

03:40:31.484 --> 03:40:33.687
CLARIFY ONE POINT THAT I THINK

03:40:33.753 --> 03:40:36.022
WE PROBABLY DISAGREE ON. AND

03:40:36.089 --> 03:40:37.591
THAT WOULD BE THAT IT IS

03:40:37.657 --> 03:40:39.092
INEVITABLE THAT THE PRODUCTION

03:40:39.159 --> 03:40:41.428
IN THE STATE IS DECLINING AND

03:40:41.494 --> 03:40:42.662
SHOULD CONTINUE AND SHOULD GO

03:40:42.729 --> 03:40:44.698
AWAY. THAT IS THE FARTHEST FROM

03:40:44.764 --> 03:40:47.734
THE TRUTH WE ARE A VERY THE

03:40:47.801 --> 03:40:49.135
RESERVES AND CURRENT COUNTY ARE

03:40:49.202 --> 03:40:50.971
STILL AMONG THIS IS RESERVES IN

03:40:51.037 --> 03:40:52.505
THE GROUND AND YOU CAN TALK TO

03:40:52.572 --> 03:40:53.607
THE KERN COUNTY TAX ASSESSOR

03:40:53.673 --> 03:40:55.442
WHO ASSESSES US ON. RESERVES IN

03:40:55.508 --> 03:40:58.311
THE GROUND- IS THE HIGHEST IN

03:40:58.378 --> 03:41:01.147
THE NATION IT REMAINS TO BE. IF

03:41:01.214 --> 03:41:02.983
YOU THIS PRODUCTION THE STATE

03:41:03.049 --> 03:41:04.651
WERE IT IT RESPONDS REALLY WELL

03:41:04.718 --> 03:41:05.986
TO INVESTMENT AND SO THE MORE

03:41:06.052 --> 03:41:07.354
INVESTMENT THAT'S MADE IF YOU

03:41:07.420 --> 03:41:08.421
CAN MAKE AN ECONOMIC

03:41:08.488 --> 03:41:10.557
INVESTMENT. THE MORE OR WILL BE

03:41:10.624 --> 03:41:11.958
PRODUCED IN THAT GRAPH WILL

03:41:12.025 --> 03:41:12.959
TURN AROUND FROM WHAT IT

03:41:13.026 --> 03:41:14.628
SHOWING. SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S

03:41:14.694 --> 03:41:16.696
A NATURAL DECLINE IS DECLINING

03:41:16.763 --> 03:41:17.731
FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE OF

03:41:17.797 --> 03:41:19.699
WHICH IS IF YOU CAN'T INVEST

03:41:19.766 --> 03:41:21.668
ECONOMICALLY. IT WILL CONTINUE

03:41:21.735 --> 03:41:23.136
TO APPLY BUT IF YOU CAN IT

03:41:23.203 --> 03:41:25.105
RESPONSE QUITE WELL TO IT AND

03:41:25.171 --> 03:41:27.273
HAS FOR YOU KNOW A HUNDRED

03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:30.410
YEARS. CUT BUT I DO. THAT YOU

03:41:30.477 --> 03:41:32.479
SEE AND HAVE SEEN CONTINUAL

03:41:32.545 --> 03:41:34.514
SUPPORT BY THIS INDUSTRY IN ALL

03:41:34.581 --> 03:41:36.383
FACETS OF ALL THE THINGS WE

03:41:36.449 --> 03:41:38.518
TALKED ABOUT AND- LIKE I SAID

03:41:38.585 --> 03:41:40.754
IM PERSONALLY INVESTED IN THE

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:42.288
SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM- WHICH

03:41:42.355 --> 03:41:44.524
AGAIN. HAVING COMMUNITIES STEP

03:41:44.591 --> 03:41:45.992
TO THE PLATE AND TAKE

03:41:46.059 --> 03:41:47.494
LEADERSHIP AS THEY HAVE IS JUST

03:41:47.560 --> 03:41:50.163
AMAZING. AND TO HAVE THAT

03:41:50.230 --> 03:41:53.033
ABILITY TO USE SCIENCE. TO PUT

03:41:53.099 --> 03:41:55.335
MONITORS IN COMMUNITIES FIGURE

03:41:55.402 --> 03:41:56.703
OUT WHERE THINGS ARE COMING

03:41:56.770 --> 03:41:57.971
FROM AND THEN WHAT MITIGATION

03:41:58.038 --> 03:41:59.239
PLANS WERE GOING TO DO TO

03:41:59.305 --> 03:42:01.541
REDUCE SOME. THAT'S REMARKABLE.

03:42:01.608 --> 03:42:03.410
ON AND- FOR THAT SO FOR THIS

03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:06.046
TACK NUMBERS SHE GAVE IN THE PM

03:42:06.112 --> 03:42:07.847
TWO POINT FIVE ANY DISPUTE WITH

03:42:07.914 --> 03:42:09.215
THOSE NUMBER I COULD PUT UP AS

03:42:09.282 --> 03:42:11.151
MANY SHOT SLIDE SHOWING THE

03:42:11.217 --> 03:42:13.086
ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL OF

03:42:13.153 --> 03:42:14.254
THOSE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS

03:42:14.320 --> 03:42:16.089
MADE OVER TIME IN THE GRASS

03:42:16.156 --> 03:42:18.525
WOULD BE GOING. THIS WAY. SO I

03:42:18.591 --> 03:42:20.093
GET OUT WE CAN HAVE CONTINUED

03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:21.394
DISCUSSION ON THAT I THINK YOU

03:42:21.461 --> 03:42:24.030
WOULD SEE- THE OTHER ONE IS THE

03:42:24.097 --> 03:42:25.131
KERN COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL

03:42:25.198 --> 03:42:26.766
IMPACT REPORT THE MOST

03:42:26.833 --> 03:42:28.735
AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM THAT THAT

03:42:28.802 --> 03:42:30.904
THE THAT COUNTY PUT IN PLACE.

03:42:30.970 --> 03:42:32.772
TO MITIGATE ALL MEASURES UP

03:42:32.839 --> 03:42:34.007
FRONT FOR TWENTY YEARS OF

03:42:34.074 --> 03:42:36.109
PRODUCTION. UNBELIEVABLE

03:42:36.176 --> 03:42:38.712
REMARKABLE PROGRAM THAT KERN

03:42:38.778 --> 03:42:40.814
COUNTY INITIATED WITH THE-

03:42:40.880 --> 03:42:43.616
COOPERATION OF THE INDUSTRY-

03:42:43.683 --> 03:42:45.385
AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE

03:42:45.452 --> 03:42:48.288
DEMONSTRATED. IS COOPERATION IN

03:42:48.354 --> 03:42:50.657
ALL OF THESE ASPECTS. LIKE I

03:42:50.724 --> 03:42:52.092
SAID SB EIGHTY THREE IS WRITING

03:42:52.158 --> 03:42:53.526

PLUG THE- SAME KIND OF A THING

03:43:09.509 --> 03:43:10.410
WITH THE OR FOR NOT A WELL

03:43:10.477 --> 03:43:12.479
ISSUE. I CAN SINCE I'VE BEEN

03:43:12.545 --> 03:43:13.513
DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME I

03:43:13.580 --> 03:43:15.215
CAN REMEMBER WHEN YOU ALL ASKED

03:43:15.281 --> 03:43:17.283

03:43:17.350 --> 03:43:18.418
OR FOR NOT A WELL BILL. BILL

03:43:18.485 --> 03:43:20.019
WHERE WE HAD WE DIDN'T HAVE WE

03:43:20.086 --> 03:43:21.955
DIDN'T HAVE A FUND. AND WE

03:43:22.021 --> 03:43:23.189
STEPPED UP PLACE TO PUT I THINK

03:43:23.256 --> 03:43:23.890
SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON THE

03:43:23.957 --> 03:43:26.459
TABLE COLLECTIVELY TO. HAVE

03:43:26.526 --> 03:43:27.660
THAT FUND NOW WE NEED TO GROW

03:43:27.727 --> 03:43:28.661

SEPARATE YET BUT I WILL- AND SO

03:43:35.635 --> 03:43:37.937
I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO

03:43:38.004 --> 03:43:39.205
COMMUNICATE IS THAT THIS

03:43:39.272 --> 03:43:40.507

WE REAL A- THERE TO FIGURE OUT

03:43:47.914 --> 03:43:49.916
HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT I

03:43:49.983 --> 03:43:52.485
THINK YOU HEARD FROM OUR MEMBER

03:43:52.552 --> 03:43:54.154
IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT.

03:43:54.220 --> 03:43:56.189

03:43:56.256 --> 03:43:58.625
THE PLATE FIGURING IT OUT AND I

03:43:58.691 --> 03:44:00.493
WOULD SAY ON A WORK FORCE-

03:44:00.560 --> 03:44:02.095
WE'RE VERY EXCITED OF THE

03:44:02.162 --> 03:44:03.863
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE WITH

03:44:03.930 --> 03:44:05.131
PEOPLE LIKE THE BUILDING TRADES

03:44:05.198 --> 03:44:07.634
WHO WILL TAKE PEOPLE WITH VERY

03:44:07.700 --> 03:44:09.636
LITTLE- TRAINING AND EDUCATION

03:44:09.702 --> 03:44:10.336
PUT THEM THROUGH AN

03:44:10.403 --> 03:44:12.172
APPRENTICESHIP. PROGRAM TRAIN

03:44:12.238 --> 03:44:13.540
THEM AND PAY THEM THROUGH THAT

03:44:13.606 --> 03:44:15.175
TRAINING AND WE'RE ABLE TO

03:44:15.241 --> 03:44:16.643
OFFER JOBS WHEN THEY COME OUT

03:44:16.709 --> 03:44:18.812
OF THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM-

03:44:18.878 --> 03:44:20.947
IMMEDIATELY SO. I THINK THERE'S

03:44:21.014 --> 03:44:22.482
A LOT OF EXCITING WORKFORCE

03:44:22.549 --> 03:44:24.484
DEVELOPMENT ISSUES I WOULD SAY

03:44:24.551 --> 03:44:26.186
AS FAR AS THE YOUNGER

03:44:26.252 --> 03:44:29.189
GENERATION- WE HAVE A GROUP

03:44:29.255 --> 03:44:30.256

EXPERTISE AND ENVIRONMENTAL. SO

03:44:47.807 --> 03:44:49.142
I THINK THERE'S A HUGE

03:44:49.209 --> 03:44:51.144
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE

03:44:51.211 --> 03:44:53.379

03:44:55.381 --> 03:44:56.516
AS I'VE SAID WE DON'T NEED A

03:44:56.583 --> 03:44:58.418
TRANSITION JUST BECAUSE WE'RE

03:44:58.484 --> 03:45:00.286

GET THE GRANTS AND HOPEFULLY

03:45:54.574 --> 03:45:56.843
YOU GET SOME SENSE OF WHAT'S

03:45:56.910 --> 03:45:57.644
ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON YOUR NOSE

03:45:57.710 --> 03:46:01.481
SO. MAYES INDUSTRY LOOKING AT

03:46:01.547 --> 03:46:04.250
ANY CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO.

03:46:04.317 --> 03:46:05.652
BEYOND EVEN OFFSETTING THE NET

03:46:05.718 --> 03:46:07.353
HEALTH COSTS ACTUALLY JUST

03:46:07.420 --> 03:46:11.524
HELPING US GET- A FRAMEWORK IN

03:46:11.591 --> 03:46:14.360
PLACE THAT'S GONNA BE. FUNDED

03:46:14.427 --> 03:46:17.130
AND DURABLE- I MEAN WE CAN KEEP

03:46:17.196 --> 03:46:19.565
GOING BACK TO TAXPAYERS ARE THE

03:46:19.632 --> 03:46:20.433
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

03:46:20.500 --> 03:46:23.002
BUT- IT'S FRUSTRATING HAVE TO

03:46:23.069 --> 03:46:25.371
EVERY YEAR FIGHT FOR THAT POT I

03:46:25.438 --> 03:46:27.273
MEAN ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON WELL

03:46:27.340 --> 03:46:29.342
OTHER THAN WE CONTRIBUTE

03:46:29.409 --> 03:46:29.976
MAJORLY TO THE GREENHOUSE SURE

03:46:30.043 --> 03:46:32.178
YOU. RIGHT RIGHT LIKE A PART IN

03:46:32.245 --> 03:46:33.680
IT ENDS UP GOING OTHER THINGS

03:46:33.746 --> 03:46:34.681
AND THEY WERE AND WE WANT TO

03:46:34.747 --> 03:46:36.516
FOCUS ON MITIGATION NOT JUST

03:46:36.582 --> 03:46:37.951
STRICTLY MONITORING AND THERE

03:46:38.017 --> 03:46:39.485
IT'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY

03:46:39.552 --> 03:46:41.354
THAT THERE'S TOO MANY REQUESTS

03:46:41.421 --> 03:46:42.722
FOR RIGHT RIGHT SO I THINK

03:46:42.789 --> 03:46:44.691
PRIORITIZING. HOW YOU SPEND

03:46:44.757 --> 03:46:46.726
THAT MONEY I WOULD CHALLENGE US

03:46:46.793 --> 03:46:48.227
ALL TO LOOK FOR INCREASED

03:46:48.294 --> 03:46:50.096
FUNDING FOR SIX SEVENTEEN WHO

03:46:50.163 --> 03:46:52.031
DID TEND COMMUNITIES LAST YEAR

03:46:52.098 --> 03:46:52.932
WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE ENOUGH

03:46:52.999 --> 03:46:53.933
MONEY TO DO THREE THAT'S

03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:56.102
UNACCEPTABLE YEAH SO ANGRY THAT

03:46:56.169 --> 03:46:57.904
I MADE MY GREW WITH YOU. SO I

03:46:57.971 --> 03:47:00.206
DO THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT

03:47:00.273 --> 03:47:01.441
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD

03:47:01.507 --> 03:47:03.142
ON THAT PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR

03:47:03.209 --> 03:47:05.144
BECAUSE FRANKLY WE HAVE FOUR

03:47:05.211 --> 03:47:05.745
HUNDRED COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE

03:47:05.812 --> 03:47:08.014
ONLY DONE TEN. RIGHT RIGHT BUT

03:47:08.081 --> 03:47:09.515
WHAT WAS WHAT WAS BRILLIANT IN

03:47:09.582 --> 03:47:11.050
MY MIND ABOUT THAT PROGRAM IN

03:47:11.117 --> 03:47:13.353
ALL OF YOU PASSING IT WAS THAT

03:47:13.419 --> 03:47:15.421
IT REALLY IS A FOUNDATION OF

03:47:15.488 --> 03:47:17.824
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING THIS

03:47:17.890 --> 03:47:19.058
WHOLE HEARING WHICH IS. LET

03:47:19.125 --> 03:47:22.362
SIGN DICTATE THE ANSWER RIGHT

03:47:22.428 --> 03:47:23.963
WE ALL WE'RE ALL GOING INTO

03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:25.465
THIS WITH WHAT WE IT MAY BE US

03:47:25.531 --> 03:47:27.800
IT MIGHT NOT BE A- BUT IF IT IS

03:47:27.867 --> 03:47:30.269
A STEP TO PLAY FOR TO DEAL WITH.

03:47:30.336 --> 03:47:32.772
RIGHTS PUT THAT SIGN SIMPLE

03:47:32.839 --> 03:47:34.640
MAKE COMMENTS WHAT WE DO SO

03:47:34.707 --> 03:47:36.009
CANNOT HEALTH ISSUES THAT

03:47:36.075 --> 03:47:41.914
COMMUNITIES ABOUT BILL. SO WE

03:47:41.981 --> 03:47:43.783
KNOW WE WERE ABOUT AT NIGHT

03:47:43.850 --> 03:47:51.824
DAMAGE THAT CONTINUED THE.

03:47:51.891 --> 03:47:54.060
FIRST REMAIN AM. I WAS SIX

03:47:54.127 --> 03:47:55.862
SEVEN IS JUST ONE TINY PIECE OF.

03:47:55.928 --> 03:47:57.930
THE MORAL TO DEAL THIS GRAY

03:47:57.997 --> 03:48:01.034
RIGHT BUT AT I AM AND FROM YOUR-

03:48:01.100 --> 03:48:02.468
YOUR FOCUS IN THE CENTRAL

03:48:02.535 --> 03:48:05.004
VALLEY BUT- I MEAN IS THERE

03:48:05.071 --> 03:48:06.739
PROGRESS WE CAN BE MAKING THIS

03:48:06.806 --> 03:48:09.942
YEAR ON THAT MONITORING FRONT

03:48:10.009 --> 03:48:13.379
DOOR ON ON DEALING WITH. NOT

03:48:13.446 --> 03:48:15.248
HAVING IT IS A TAX THE GDR F.

03:48:15.314 --> 03:48:16.215
ME HAVE YOU GUYS GIVEN ANY

03:48:16.282 --> 03:48:19.285
THOUGHT TO WHAT. ACTUALLY HE

03:48:19.352 --> 03:48:20.953
GETTING OUR COMMUNITIES

03:48:21.020 --> 03:48:24.557
ADEQUATELY. YEAH MONITORS AT

03:48:24.624 --> 03:48:25.858
THIS POINT WE YOU KNOW

03:48:25.925 --> 03:48:27.693
MONITORING IS NOT THE ANSWER I

03:48:27.760 --> 03:48:29.662
MEAN TIME TO COMMUNITIES AND

03:48:29.729 --> 03:48:31.497
COMMUNITIES NO. YOU KNOW THEY

03:48:31.564 --> 03:48:32.665
WANT TO SEE THEY WANT TO SEE

03:48:32.732 --> 03:48:34.967
REDUCTIONS ARE- AND SO THE

03:48:35.034 --> 03:48:37.770
OVERLY OVERLY FOCUS EMPHASIS ON

03:48:37.837 --> 03:48:40.640
ON MODERATE MONITORING- WHEN

03:48:40.706 --> 03:48:41.641
YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST ADDING TO

03:48:41.707 --> 03:48:42.742
THE POLLUTION BURDENS ISN'T

03:48:42.809 --> 03:48:44.577
GOOD ENOUGH. ON AND SO WITHOUT

03:48:44.644 --> 03:48:46.846
HAVING MANDATED REDUCTIONS I'M

03:48:46.913 --> 03:48:49.215
A IN COMMUNITIES IT IT IT IT

03:48:49.282 --> 03:48:50.183
IT'S REALLY TOO LITTLE TOO

03:48:50.249 --> 03:48:53.386
LATE- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT

03:48:53.453 --> 03:48:54.387
TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS YOUR

03:48:54.454 --> 03:48:55.888
ESTIMATE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS

03:48:55.955 --> 03:48:57.523
WITHIN KERN COUNTY I THINK THAT

03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:58.925
WAS A STUDY THAT YEAH AND THEN

03:48:58.991 --> 03:49:00.460
YOU'D- THINK YOU GIVE TWENTY.

03:49:00.526 --> 03:49:01.961
BILLION FOR AIR POLLUTION WRIT

03:49:02.028 --> 03:49:03.362
LARGE WHICH IS ALSO MOBILE

03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:07.533
SOURCES I'M SURE IF IT WAS THE

03:49:07.600 --> 03:49:08.468
TWO HUNDRED MILLION RELATED TO.

03:49:08.534 --> 03:49:10.970
I OIL INDUSTRY OPERATIONS SO

03:49:11.037 --> 03:49:13.005
THAT WAS FOUR MEASURE INTERNET.

03:49:13.072 --> 03:49:15.641
HEALTH COSTS ON THE HEIRS HAYES

03:49:15.708 --> 03:49:17.477
AND- YEAH WELL THAT WAS A THAT

03:49:17.543 --> 03:49:18.544
WAS THE ESTIMATE FOR KERN

03:49:18.611 --> 03:49:20.613
COUNTY- FOR THE AIR POLLUTION

03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:23.549
BURDEN- I THINK WE WOULD SUBMIT

03:49:23.616 --> 03:49:25.251
THAT OIL AND GAS. MAKES UP A

03:49:25.318 --> 03:49:27.120
SIZEABLE PERCENT OF THAT BUT OF

03:49:27.186 --> 03:49:28.287
COURSE YOUR HONOR THE ISSUES

03:49:28.354 --> 03:49:29.455
WITH KERN COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL

03:49:29.522 --> 03:49:31.290
VALLEY. IS THERE'S A LOT OF

03:49:31.357 --> 03:49:34.293
POLLUTION BURDENS CRACKED SO.

03:49:34.360 --> 03:49:37.263
YEAH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE I

03:49:37.330 --> 03:49:41.400
GUESS IN IN SUBSEQUENT MONTHS

03:49:41.467 --> 03:49:43.202
IN IF WE CAN DO THE ANALYSIS ON

03:49:43.269 --> 03:49:45.338
ON AND MAYBE IT ALREADY EXISTS

03:49:45.404 --> 03:49:47.340
BUT THE ATTRIBUTION OF THAT

03:49:47.406 --> 03:49:49.642
COST THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS ON

03:49:49.709 --> 03:49:52.011
THE OIL SIDE AND WHAT DO YOU

03:49:52.078 --> 03:49:52.612
RESPONSE REALLY REALLY LOOKS

03:49:52.678 --> 03:49:54.480
LIKE AND- MAYBE PART OF ITS

03:49:54.547 --> 03:49:55.715
MONITORING ANDPART OF ITS

03:49:55.781 --> 03:49:59.352
MITIGATING AND- HOW THAT LOOKS.

03:49:59.418 --> 03:50:01.687
TRY TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT SORT

03:50:01.754 --> 03:50:02.221
OF WITH THE SCATTER SHOT

03:50:02.288 --> 03:50:04.257
APPROACH. THAT SYMBOLIZED

03:50:04.323 --> 03:50:05.691
ENCOURAGES TO INCLUDE

03:50:05.758 --> 03:50:06.893
EVERYTHING IN THEM YEAH YOU

03:50:06.959 --> 03:50:08.361
KNOW OF COURSE LIKE I MEAN HEY

03:50:08.427 --> 03:50:10.429
WE'RE HESITANCY SHOES YOUR

03:50:10.496 --> 03:50:11.764
NGUYEN HAS ITS ISSUES OF

03:50:11.831 --> 03:50:14.534
COURSE. HOW LITHIUM IS DRYING

03:50:14.600 --> 03:50:16.035
OR ELECTRIC VEHICLE- NAY MATTER

03:50:16.102 --> 03:50:17.637
HE SAYS THERE ISSUES YEAH SO

03:50:17.703 --> 03:50:20.039
IT'S NOT JUST. YOU KNOW ALL

03:50:20.106 --> 03:50:21.541
ENERGY SOURCES HAVE THINGS TO

03:50:21.607 --> 03:50:22.742
DEAL WITH IT'S A COMPLEX

03:50:22.808 --> 03:50:25.945
PROBLEM SO LET'S JUST LOOK AT

03:50:26.012 --> 03:50:27.480
IT IN ITS IN ITS ENTIRETY. B.

03:50:27.547 --> 03:50:31.184
YES. THOUGHTS ON THE CARBON YOU

03:50:31.250 --> 03:50:33.486
TRILOGY CONVERSATION IS BRUSH

03:50:33.553 --> 03:50:35.288
FROM THAT BE MY LAST QUESTION

03:50:35.354 --> 03:50:38.257
TO YOU HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THE

03:50:38.324 --> 03:50:41.327
THAT STUDY THE AYE AYE POP UP I

03:50:41.394 --> 03:50:43.329
MEAN I TUNE INTO SOME OF THE

03:50:43.396 --> 03:50:47.867
HEARING BUT. LIKE YOU'RE SORT

03:50:47.934 --> 03:50:49.936
OF UNSATISFIED WITH MONITORING

03:50:50.002 --> 03:50:51.571
THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY DO YOU

03:50:51.637 --> 03:50:53.706
SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT ALIGNING

03:50:53.773 --> 03:50:55.408
GOAL OR OR YOU LOOKING AT A

03:50:55.474 --> 03:50:57.810
DIFFERENT APPROACH WILL WORK

03:50:57.877 --> 03:51:00.413
SAID ABOUT THE STUDY- WE ARE-

03:51:00.479 --> 03:51:01.781
AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE

03:51:01.847 --> 03:51:03.216
LOOKING BOTH AT SUPPLY AND

03:51:03.282 --> 03:51:04.984
DEMAND BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS

03:51:05.051 --> 03:51:07.653
GOT TO BE PART OF. THE EQUATION

03:51:07.720 --> 03:51:09.889
I'M WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO RAMP

03:51:09.956 --> 03:51:11.724
DOWN OUR DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA

03:51:11.791 --> 03:51:13.793
THERE'S NO DEBATE THERE- WE

03:51:13.859 --> 03:51:15.261
ALSO NEED TO RAMP DOWN OUR

03:51:15.328 --> 03:51:16.896
SUPPLIES SO I THINK- HAVING

03:51:16.963 --> 03:51:18.631
THOSE STUDIES AND HAVING

03:51:18.698 --> 03:51:21.367
OPPORTUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED IN

03:51:21.434 --> 03:51:22.935
IN THE STUDIES I THINK IS

03:51:23.002 --> 03:51:24.370
REALLY CRITICAL I'M MOST

03:51:24.437 --> 03:51:25.938
PLEASED THAT THE WORKFORCE

03:51:26.005 --> 03:51:27.673
DEVELOPMENT FOLKS AT THE STATE

03:51:27.740 --> 03:51:29.508
ARE VERY INVOLVED IN IN IN

03:51:29.575 --> 03:51:31.444
THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE TO ME

03:51:31.510 --> 03:51:32.511
THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF

03:51:32.578 --> 03:51:34.914
THE BIGGEST PIECES- IS THAT WE

03:51:34.981 --> 03:51:37.283
MAKE SURE- YOU KNOW THAT WE

03:51:37.350 --> 03:51:38.117
HAVE KIND OF A HOLISTIC

03:51:38.184 --> 03:51:38.985
APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THE WORK

03:51:39.051 --> 03:51:41.687
FORCE- LOOKING AT YOU KNOW

03:51:41.754 --> 03:51:43.489
RAMPING DOWN PRODUCTION IN A-

03:51:43.556 --> 03:51:45.191
YOU KNOW. MEASURED AND

03:51:45.258 --> 03:51:47.493
RESPONSIBLE WAY ON MAKING SURE

03:51:47.560 --> 03:51:49.428
THAT NOBODY GETS LEFT OUT- SO

03:51:49.495 --> 03:51:52.164
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING

03:51:52.231 --> 03:51:53.466
WITH THE STATE- AND REVIEWING

03:51:53.532 --> 03:51:54.634
THIS STUDY SO I THINK IT'S A

03:51:54.700 --> 03:51:55.167
IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT

03:51:55.234 --> 03:51:57.103
DIRECTION BUT IT REALLY IS NOT

03:51:57.169 --> 03:51:59.605
MUCH MONEY IN THERE- AND IS A

03:51:59.672 --> 03:52:01.574
BIG A BIG QUINCY MILLION

03:52:01.641 --> 03:52:02.375
DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT LAST YEAR

03:52:02.441 --> 03:52:04.010
SOMEONE THREE MILLION YEAH FOR

03:52:04.076 --> 03:52:05.845
BOTH FOR BOTH- SUCH A MASSIVE

03:52:05.911 --> 03:52:08.347
PROMOTES A WRIT LARGE WE'RE

03:52:08.414 --> 03:52:10.249
UNDER SHOOTING IT TERMS OF HOW

03:52:10.316 --> 03:52:13.452
BRING ALL THIS WORK OUT- WE

03:52:13.519 --> 03:52:17.023
WERE FINDING CAL JIM RIGHT NOW-

03:52:17.089 --> 03:52:19.692
THE TREE SO THAT ARE AVAILABLE

03:52:19.759 --> 03:52:20.660
FOR SICK SEVEN IN THIS OR ANY

03:52:20.726 --> 03:52:28.267
QUITE TO GOT A- USE UP. WHAT

03:52:28.334 --> 03:52:30.536
GOT A WRESTLE AT. AND ABOUT

03:52:30.603 --> 03:52:32.938
THIS CLIMATE OF. EN GET OIL

03:52:33.005 --> 03:52:34.473
MAJORS TO WAY UP A SERIES. A

03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:35.274
CHALLENGE THEM I LIKE THERE'S

03:52:35.341 --> 03:52:37.677
SOME. NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES

03:52:37.743 --> 03:52:40.079
WHERE WE HAVE. STRANGELY

03:52:40.146 --> 03:52:42.348
ALIGNED INTEREST HERE- THAT

03:52:42.415 --> 03:52:44.016
SEEM LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

03:52:44.083 --> 03:52:45.284
MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD THIS

03:52:45.351 --> 03:52:48.721
YEAR- YEAH I THINK OF LIKE I

03:52:48.788 --> 03:52:50.856
WANT KERN COUNTY. TO HAVE

03:52:50.923 --> 03:52:53.859
KNOWLEDGE AND- SOME POWER OVER

03:52:53.926 --> 03:52:54.994
WHAT'S IMPACTING THEIR HEALTH

03:52:55.061 --> 03:52:57.096
BUT- YOU KNOW. YOU DOCTOR WHERE

03:52:57.163 --> 03:52:59.398
PEOPLE PRAY. I GO TO SYNAGOGUE

03:52:59.465 --> 03:53:02.335
AND ON PICO IN LA WE GOT.

03:53:02.401 --> 03:53:04.670
THINGS GO PACIFIC. COAST ENERGY

03:53:04.737 --> 03:53:06.939
PRODUCERS DOUG MATT. TO SITES

03:53:07.006 --> 03:53:09.775
RIGHT LA ALL THEY WANT IS A

03:53:09.842 --> 03:53:11.577
MONITOR RIGHT AND YET THEY'RE

03:53:11.644 --> 03:53:13.279
GONNA BE BACK A LINE BECAUSE

03:53:13.346 --> 03:53:14.814
THEY'RE IN LA AND THERE'S OTHER

03:58:28.661 --> 03:58:30.029
LAST YEAR I REINTRODUCE THE

03:58:30.095 --> 03:58:31.930
WEST COAST OCEAN PROTECTION ACT

03:58:31.997 --> 03:58:32.698

PROHIBIT OIL DRILLING IN THESE

03:58:34.033 --> 03:58:35.267

INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. I AM

03:58:46.045 --> 03:58:47.413
PLEASED TO REPORT THAT OUR BILL

03:58:47.479 --> 03:58:48.747
RECENTLY PASSED THE HOUSE OF

03:58:53.986 --> 03:58:54.920
BELIEVE THAT ALL FUTURE

DECISIONS ON FOSSIL FUEL

03:58:56.522 --> 03:58:58.223
EXPIRATION IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD

03:58:58.290 --> 03:58:59.692
BE CONSIDERED THROUGH THE LNS

CALIFORNIA'S OIL INDUSTRY WILL

03:59:21.480 --> 03:59:22.915
MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE.

03:59:22.981 --> 03:59:23.849
