00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.794
AND THERE WILL OF COURSE BE MORE

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.595
MONEY COMING WHEN THE NEW BUDGET

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:10.763
GOES INTO EFFECT.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.532
BUT THAT MONEY WILL BE USED UP

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:14.901
QUICKLY WILL NOT COME CLOSE. TO

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.470

SO THIS BILL MAKES SOME OF THE

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.946
SMART AND NECESSARY ADJUSTMENTS.

00:07:27.013 --> 00:07:28.247
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE REBATE

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:31.350
PROJECT TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:32.518

SALES ARE WAY UP.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.277
THAT ALSO MEANS THERE'S MORE

00:07:58.344 --> 00:08:00.580
STRESS ON A LIMITED BUDGET SO

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:02.248

STILL A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT ON

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:49.982
THE ROADS WE BELIEVE THAT THE

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:52.785
AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS THE PLACE

00:10:52.852 --> 00:10:53.352
TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:56.222

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:57.823
FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THESE

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.459
CHANGES THEY'RE THE EXPERTS YOU

KNOW WE'RE WE HAVE HISTORIC.

00:11:03.129 --> 00:11:04.563
A CHALLENGES FOR WORKING WITH

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.132
THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND SO

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.333
IT'S SOMETHING WHEN THE

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:08.934
AUTOMAKERS THEIR RESOURCES BOARD

00:11:09.001 --> 00:11:10.736
AGREED.

00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:13.139
THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE ARBITER

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:15.241
OF THIS PROGRAM -- WE HAVE THE

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.476
CHALLENGES -- THAT HAVE BEEN

00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:18.277
PAID OUT.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.679
WE WE IT MAKES THE PROGRAM MORE

00:11:20.746 --> 00:11:23.516
FLEXIBLE WHEN THEY ARE BE HAS

00:11:23.582 --> 00:11:25.351
THAT THAT -- THE CHANGES THEY

00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:27.086
CAN MAKE THAT TO EXTEND THE

00:11:27.153 --> 00:11:28.821
LIMITED FUNDS OF THINGS AS ARE

00:11:28.888 --> 00:11:30.890
ALL STATUTORY -- THAT'S A THAT'S

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.758
A CHALLENGE -- AND I THINK WE

00:11:32.825 --> 00:11:34.126
HAVE TO ACCEPT.

00:11:34.193 --> 00:11:36.429
THE REALITY THAT THIS IS THESE

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:39.065
ARE STILL VERY EXPENSIVE

00:11:39.131 --> 00:11:41.634
AUTOMOBILES WE ARE TRYING TO WE

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.202
WILL SELL THEM TO ANYBODY THAT

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.270
BUYS THEM BUT WE HAVE TO TO

00:11:44.336 --> 00:11:48.641
REALIZE THEY ARE MORE EXPENSIVE.

00:11:48.707 --> 00:11:49.542
AND THAT.

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:50.142
IT IS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO

00:11:50.209 --> 00:11:51.911
PURCHASE AND THE AMENDMENTS

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:54.146
AGAIN ARE HELPFUL.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.416
BUT WITH THE RESTRICTIONS ON

00:11:57.483 --> 00:11:59.618
WHERE THE A. R. B. CAN -- TO

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:01.053
ALLOCATE THOSE FUNDS AND SET UP

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.455
THE PROGRAM WE THINK IT THEY'RE

00:12:02.521 --> 00:12:03.722
THEY'RE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE.

00:12:03.789 --> 00:12:05.658
AND WOULD ENCOURAGE -- THIS BILL

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.293
NOT TO BE PASSED TODAY AND LET A

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.261

ALL THAT I THINK THE BIG MY

00:16:07.032 --> 00:16:07.733
THOUGHTS ARE.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:08.701
THE BIGGEST THING IS.

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:09.635
THERE IS WITH THE WORST AIR

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:12.504
QUALITY CENTRAL VALLEY AND FOR

00:16:12.571 --> 00:16:13.572
INSTANCE MR TITLES DISTRICT. SIX

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.606

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.608
TO THE BAY AREA TWENTY THOUSAND

00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.477
NINE HERE NAY REBATES SO THE

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:19.278
AREAS WITH THE WORST OR QUALITY.

00:16:19.345 --> 00:16:20.145

EXPENSIVE AND WITH A MEDIAN

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.552
INCOME BEING. SEVENTY FOUR

00:16:26.618 --> 00:16:27.186
THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA

00:16:27.252 --> 00:16:27.786
MEANS HALF THE POPULATION OF

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:30.089
CALIFORNIA MAKES LESS THAN THAT.

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:31.290
IT WILL NOT BE ABLE BY THESE

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:31.490
CARS.

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:33.292
AND THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:34.593
THAT YEAH AND I'VE NEVER HEARD

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.095
THE AUTOMAKERS TALK ABOUT CAR

THEY'VE ALWAYS COMPLAINED ABOUT

00:16:36.795 --> 00:16:38.397
GUARDS TO CARBONI SO IT'S

00:16:38.464 --> 00:16:40.165
INTERESTING THE COMING TODAY IN.

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:42.334
SUPPORT OF CAR FOR TALKING OUT

00:16:42.401 --> 00:16:43.702

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.104
I'M SURE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.971
THESE THINGS.

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:46.939
I'LL TAKE I'LL TAKE TALK IS WHEN

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:48.707
THEY GO TO WASHINGTON I I THINK

00:16:48.774 --> 00:16:50.442
THEY'VE BEEN PRETTY STRAIGHT FOR

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:52.044
THE PRESIDENT TO THE LIKE.

00:16:52.111 --> 00:16:55.514

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:02.054
FEW YEARS.

00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:04.056
CAN WE CAN WE LINK WHAT HE'S

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.824
TALKING ABOUT THE AUTHORS TIME

00:17:05.891 --> 00:17:07.593
OUT WITH SORT OF THE SCRAPPING

00:17:07.659 --> 00:17:09.194
PROGRAM IS IT IS -- WAYS TO PUMP

00:17:09.261 --> 00:17:10.696
ALL THAT UP AND GET PENETRATION

00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:11.597
INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY MARKETS

00:17:11.663 --> 00:17:13.999
ARE IN LOWER INCOME AREAS OF LA

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:15.801
OR LONG BEACH YOUR THESE AREAS

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:17.469
WITH THE WORST AIR QUALITY DO WE

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:18.670
HAVE A SHOT AT MAKING.

00:17:18.737 --> 00:17:19.938
MORE PROGRESS HERE YES I MEAN

00:17:20.005 --> 00:17:21.673
THAT'S DEFINITELY THE GOAL AND

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.512
THE THE SCRAP REPLACE PROGRAM

00:17:26.578 --> 00:17:28.013
CLEAN CARS.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:28.747
WHICH YOU MISTER COOPER AND YOU

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:29.882
HAVE BOTH BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

00:17:29.948 --> 00:17:30.382
MOVING ALONG.

00:17:30.449 --> 00:17:31.216
HAS BEEN OFF TO AN EXCELLENT

00:17:31.283 --> 00:17:31.917
START IN BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:17:31.984 --> 00:17:32.918
VALLEY AND SOUTH COAST AIR

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:33.786
DISTRICT.

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:35.154
IT'S NOW IN THE PROCESS OF

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.156
STARTING UP IN THE BAY AREA AND

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:39.224
BY NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE A

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:40.559
PROGRAM HERE IN SACRAMENTO AIR

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:41.894
DISTRICT SO I THINK WE NEED.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.896
MORE SUPPORT FOR THOSE PROGRAMS

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:45.397
I THINK IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET

00:17:45.464 --> 00:17:46.732
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEE.

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:48.267
MORE FUNDING FOR THEM.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.003
AND AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO

00:17:51.069 --> 00:17:53.138
HAVE THE THE REBATE PROJECT CVR

00:17:53.205 --> 00:17:55.207
P. TO LIVE WITHIN ITS MEANS OR

00:17:55.274 --> 00:17:56.608
THERE'S JUST FRANKLY NOT GOING

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:57.643
TO BE ENOUGH MONEY TO GET

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:58.877
THROUGH THE YEAR.

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:01.713
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL REALLY

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.018
SIX TO DO [INAUDIBLE] THIRTY

00:18:06.084 --> 00:18:07.553
DOLLARS.

00:18:07.619 --> 00:18:09.054
SO ARE ARE USED TO WORKING WITH

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.422
AUTO -- MANUFACTURES ON THAT

00:18:10.489 --> 00:18:13.859
MILEAGE CAP YES.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:14.493
I THINK THAT'S WHY I'M PEOPLE

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.728
THOSE ARE USED TO TRAVEL LONG

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:18.530
DISTANCES AND IT'S IT'S DESK

00:18:18.597 --> 00:18:20.232
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE.

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:21.033
TO MAKE THAT LOW BUT WITH THE

00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:22.668
LAST WITH THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.504
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S AVAILABLE

00:18:25.571 --> 00:18:27.039
FOR CHARGING AS WELL

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:27.339
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:27.406 --> 00:18:29.408
RIGHT.

00:18:29.475 --> 00:18:32.744
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

00:18:32.811 --> 00:18:33.745
YEAH AND THAT'S I MEAN I THAT'S

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:35.047
REALLY PART OF THE DISPARITIES

00:18:35.113 --> 00:18:38.584
THAT HE'S LOOKING AT YOU KNOW

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.285
PEOPLE THE MORE URBAN AREAS TEND

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:42.354
TO HAVE SHORT COMMUTES.

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:44.223
SO EVEN IT WOULDN'T EVEN OTHER

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.191
MAYBE LONGER TIME WISE.

00:18:46.258 --> 00:18:49.094
THIS ONE DRIVE A CAR PULLING

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.329
YEAH WELL THAT'S THE CA YEAH I

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.964
DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT TO DEAL

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.664
WITH.

00:18:52.731 --> 00:18:53.332
WHEN IS A GOOD IDEA WITH IS THAT

00:18:53.398 --> 00:18:56.435
THEY USE BUY A CAR USE -- YOU

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:57.369
TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO

00:18:57.436 --> 00:18:57.903
THOSE STICKERS.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:58.537
AND THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT WE'RE

00:18:58.604 --> 00:18:59.505
GONNA GET A LOT I GET A LOT OF

00:18:59.571 --> 00:19:00.205
THE EQUITY ISSUES THAT YOU'VE

00:19:00.272 --> 00:19:01.540
BEEN RAISED WE DON'T DO ANYTHING

00:19:01.607 --> 00:19:02.441
NEAR ENOUGH TO HELP.

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.542
PROMOTE THAT PART OF THE MARKET

00:19:03.609 --> 00:19:05.077
THAT I THINK HAS A LOT OF

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:08.947
POTENTIAL AND AND A LOT OF

00:19:09.014 --> 00:19:12.084
BENEFITS -- SO.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.886
MINIMIZER I YES I I THINK TODAY

00:19:13.952 --> 00:19:14.953
I'M NOT COULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:15.521
IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER I

00:19:15.587 --> 00:19:16.154
THINK YOU'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT

00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:17.022
DIRECTION BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:19:17.089 --> 00:19:18.423
THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE AUTO

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.625
DEALERS ARE SIGNIFICANT WE PUT

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:21.827
THEM IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:19:21.894 --> 00:19:22.427
POSITION THAT THEY HAVE. TO

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.897
PRODUCE NO NOT JUST THESE BUT

00:19:24.963 --> 00:19:26.965
YOU KNOW AND THE WHOLE THE EEVEE

00:19:27.032 --> 00:19:28.834
ON AUTO SO I I WANT.

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.202
TO OPPOSE TODAY TO KEEP THE

00:19:30.269 --> 00:19:34.072
PRESSURE ON I DO THINK 90% OF

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:40.865
THAT I'M I'M INTERESTED IN I

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.168

CONTAMINANTS WE DO YOU KNOW

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.776
ABOUT IN MY COMMUTER AND HOW WE

00:26:51.843 --> 00:26:52.377
DEAL WITH THOSE EXISTING MAN

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:53.878
MADE DISASTERS BUT INTERESTED IN

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:55.413
HOW WE MAKE SURE WE PREVENTIVE

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.349
IN THE FUTURE AS WELL -- THE

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:59.617
MONEY'S COMING TO DO INITIALLY

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.052
THE MONIES ARE BEING USED TO PAY

00:27:01.119 --> 00:27:03.688
OFF THE LOAN THE ONE HUNDRED AND

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:04.622
SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLAR LOAN.

00:27:04.689 --> 00:27:05.757
THAT GOVERNOR BROWN HAD

00:27:05.824 --> 00:27:07.892
AUTHORIZED TO HELP CLEAN UP

EXCITED -- TO DO THE BUY TO

00:27:09.494 --> 00:27:11.296
NEGOTIATIONS THAT PRACTICE HAS

00:27:11.363 --> 00:27:13.531
NOT STOPPED IN SO THE BILL DID

00:27:13.598 --> 00:27:15.300
ALLOW FOR THAT LONG TO HAPPEN --

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:17.302
IT WAS SO TECHNICALLY WITHIN THE

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:18.303
SPIRIT BUT I THINK WITH THE

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:19.404
SPREAD OF WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:20.538

00:27:20.605 --> 00:27:22.273
WE WORRY ABOUT THE LOAN AT THE

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:22.941
END.

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:24.509
I INTO THAT PRACTICE HAS HAS NOT

00:27:24.576 --> 00:27:33.084
STOPPED THE INITIAL PROCESS TO

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:37.655
WOULD SAY MY CONSTITUENTS HAVE

00:27:37.722 --> 00:27:38.356
SHARED A LOT OF STORIES WITH US.

00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:39.357

FOR OTHER ITEMS -- ALONG THE WAY.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.261

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:10.974
HAS MORE CONTAMINATION

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:13.477
DETECTIONS THAN ANY OTHER STATE

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:14.645
THIS FAMILY A CHEMICAL HAS BEEN

00:45:14.711 --> 00:45:15.979
LINKED TO CANCER AND BIRTH

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:17.081
DEFECTS.

00:45:17.147 --> 00:45:18.515
CALIFORNIA QUITE FRANKLY HAS

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:20.384
FALLEN BEHIND WAITING FOR

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.886
CONGRESS OR THE EPA TO SAY WITH

00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:24.955
THIS WISHFUL THINKING.

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.557
AS WE SEE THAT THEY'RE OFF THE

00:45:26.623 --> 00:45:29.693
ROLLING BACK -- WORK MUCH

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.661
HONESTLY MOVING FORWARD.

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:31.295
WHILE THE INITIAL VERSIONS IS

00:45:31.361 --> 00:45:33.330
BILL WOULD HAVE REQUIRED ALL

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.731
WATER SYSTEM TO TEST THE TECH TO

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.667
WILL . FIVE THE BILL IN PENN

00:45:36.733 --> 00:45:38.135
SIMPLY BOTH THERE'S A WATER

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:39.670
WORTH INVESTIGATIVE TESTING. TO

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:40.804
GET A HANDLE LOW WHERE THESE

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:45.542
FOREVER CHEMICALS ARE.

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:46.643
THE WATER PERSONALLY EMBARKING

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:47.611
ON A FACE INVESTIGATIVE TESTING

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:48.879
OF SYSTEMS THAT ARE SUSPECTED TO

00:45:48.946 --> 00:45:51.348
HAVE CONTAMINATION.

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:52.783
ARE WITH ME HERE TODAY I HAVE

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.086
JEAN WILLIAMS AND ANDREA EVANS

00:45:56.153 --> 00:45:59.723
HER TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:00.557
DURING THE UNREGULATED

00:46:00.624 --> 00:46:02.259
CONTAMINANT MONITORING ROLE

00:46:02.326 --> 00:46:03.460
FIFTEEN WELLS WERE ACTUALLY

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.561
FOUND TO BE CONTAMINATED WITH

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.196
THESE CHEMICALS IN CALIFORNIA

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:07.598
WERE SHUT DOWN BUT THERE WERE

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:08.532
YOU.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:10.367
NOTIFICATION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.535
DRINKING THAT WATER.

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.838
AND IT CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED HOW.

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:17.174
TOXIC THIS CONTAMINANT IS IT TOO

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.610
CAN TO PCB BUT PC BEES DON'T

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.345
USUALLY GET INTO DRINKING WATER.

00:46:21.411 --> 00:46:22.813
THESE CHEMICALS DO THEY'RE

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.415
EXTREMELY SOLUBLE -- WHEN I

00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:31.321
TESTIFIED RECENTLY IT'S?

00:46:31.388 --> 00:46:32.589
POLLS FOUND IN DRINKING WATER

00:46:32.656 --> 00:46:33.624
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA END UP WITH

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:35.959
AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE PROBLEM

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.127
TO FIX.

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.795
AND IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE

00:46:38.862 --> 00:46:40.430
IN CRISTINA GARCIA IS DISTRICT

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.466
IT'S GOING TO BE IN DISTRICTS

00:46:42.533 --> 00:46:43.867
LIKE YOURS TO SENATOR DOLLING.

00:46:43.934 --> 00:46:44.968
WHEREVER THEIR MILITARY BASES

00:46:45.035 --> 00:46:45.636
WERE GONNA FIND THAT THESE

00:46:45.702 --> 00:46:47.204
CHEMICALS HAVE CONTAMINATED

00:46:47.271 --> 00:46:48.372
DRINKING WATER.

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:51.942
SO -- THIS BILL WOULD -- NOTIFY

00:46:52.009 --> 00:46:53.744
PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.746
DRINKING CONTAMINATED WATER --

00:46:55.812 --> 00:46:57.748
THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION THEN

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.716
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY SHOULD

00:46:59.783 --> 00:47:02.452
FIND NEW SOURCES OF WATER AND

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.254
RIGHT NOW JUST IN PHASE ONE OF

00:47:04.321 --> 00:47:05.789
THEIR SIX HUNDRED AND SIXTY

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:06.857
WELLS.

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:08.358
THERE IS NO COUNTY THAT IS

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:11.094
UNAFFECTED BY THE SOURCE WELLS.

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:13.130
FROM AND THERE'S TWO HUNDRED

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:14.331
NINE WATER SYSTEMS THAT'S JUST

00:47:14.398 --> 00:47:15.699
DAYS ONE OF THE THREE PHASE

00:47:15.766 --> 00:47:17.968
PROGRAM TO LOOK EXTENSIVELY FOR

00:47:18.035 --> 00:47:19.102
THESE CHEMICALS.

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:21.171
IN OUR DRINKING WATER WELLS AND

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:22.806
AT AT SOURCES WHICH ARE

00:47:22.873 --> 00:47:25.108
LANDFILLS AIRPORTS REFINERIES

00:47:25.175 --> 00:47:29.146
CHEMICAL MANUFACTURING

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.215
FACILITIES IN CHROME PLATING.

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:33.050
SO I READ YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:33.917
SURE I WILL BE IN FOR THIS

00:47:33.984 --> 00:47:34.685
COMMITTEE AGAIN ON THESE

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:35.118
CHEMICALS THEY ARE

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.453
EXTRAORDINARILY TOXIC AND VERY

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.722
PERVASIVE NOW IN OUR DRINKING

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:46.296
WATER SYSTEMS THANK YOU.

00:47:46.363 --> 00:47:47.798
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:48.465
HI I'M ANDREA EVAN TURNER WITH

00:47:48.532 --> 00:47:53.003
CLEAN WATER ACTION AND I WANT.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:55.172
TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:56.873
THIS BILL AS A STEP IN MOVING

00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:58.508
FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA AS YOU

00:47:58.575 --> 00:48:01.511
HEARD CALIFORNIA BASED ON

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:02.879
LIMITED DATA.

00:48:02.946 --> 00:48:05.382
OF ACTUALLY HAS THE MOST TO TECH

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:08.118
KNOWN DETECTIONS IN THE COUNTRY

00:48:08.185 --> 00:48:10.587
AND YET WE ARE FAR BEHIND OTHER

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.990
STATES THAT ARE MOVING TO GET A

00:48:13.056 --> 00:48:15.259
BETTER GRIP ON WHAT THIS

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:17.294
CONTAMINATION MEANS SO.

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:19.563
MIGHT MY HOPE TO BE HERE TODAY

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.265
IS TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A LITTLE

00:48:21.331 --> 00:48:22.666
BIT OF BACKGROUND BECAUSE AS

00:48:22.733 --> 00:48:24.668
AWARENESS HAS BEEN GROWING.

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:27.137
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND OUR STATE

00:48:27.204 --> 00:48:29.373
ABOUT THESE FOREVER CHEMICALS

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:31.341
THEY DO NOT BREAK DWN THEY ARE

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:33.277
GOING TO BE WITH US.

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.212
PRETTY MUCH FOREVER -- I JUST

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:36.780
WANTED TO PROVIDE A LITTLE A FEW

00:48:36.847 --> 00:48:38.582
BACKGROUND POINTS ABOUT WHAT

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:39.850
THEY ARE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

00:48:39.916 --> 00:48:41.385
OF MISINFORMATION OUT THERE.

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:43.253
FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A CLASS OF

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:44.688
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND CHEMICALS.

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:47.557
ARE WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT.

00:48:47.624 --> 00:48:49.293
WITH THE VAST METADATA IS CHIU

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:50.761
CHEMICALS AND BEEN USED FOR

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:53.930
DECADES BUT THE GROWING NUMBER

00:48:53.997 --> 00:48:55.732
OF THESE NEWER GENERATION

00:48:55.799 --> 00:48:58.368
CHEMICALS ARE AS PERVASIVE AND

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:02.773
AS PERMANENT IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

00:49:02.839 --> 00:49:03.807
AND DESPITE SOME CLAIMS FROM THE

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:04.841
CHEMICAL INDUSTRY TAT THESE

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.276
NEWER VERSIONS ARE SAFER WHAT

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:07.878
THAT REALLY MEANS IS THEY HAVE

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.413
NOT BEEN STUDIED.

00:49:09.479 --> 00:49:11.948
AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEIR OLDER

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:14.484
COUSINS BUT THE EMERGING SCIENCE

00:49:14.551 --> 00:49:16.086
AND SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:16.820
WORLD TO CALLING THE ALARM ON

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:17.454
THIS.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:18.755
IS THAT THEY ARE STRUCTURALLY

00:49:18.822 --> 00:49:22.292
THE SAME AND ARE EXTREMELY TOXIC

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:23.694
SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IN

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.629
CALIFORNIA AS OUR FIRST STEP IS

00:49:25.696 --> 00:49:27.297
TO GET A BETTER PICTURE OF HOW

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:28.699
MUCH OF THIS STUFF IS OUT THERE

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:30.767
AND REALLY WHAT IT IS WHICH

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.235
CHEMICALS ARE OUT THERE.

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:34.604
AND THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT

00:49:34.671 --> 00:49:37.040
STEP IN THAT DIRECTION -- I DID

00:49:37.107 --> 00:49:38.575
WANT TO JUST MAKE TWO FINAL

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:41.411
POINTS ON THIS YOU MAY HEAR THAT

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.846
AS THE YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL

00:49:42.913 --> 00:49:44.214
GOVERNMENT HAS A PLAN TO DEAL

00:49:44.281 --> 00:49:45.449
WITH THIS.

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:46.717
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.784
PLAN THAT WILL DEAL WITH CHIU

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:50.620
CHEMICALS AT A FIVE THOUSAND AND

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:52.522
THERE ARE NO DEADLINES THERE ARE

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.524
NO GUARANTEES OF HOW THIS IS

00:49:54.591 --> 00:49:55.759
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD.

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.327
THAT'S WHAT I STATES LIKE NEW

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:58.628
YORK VERMONT.

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.597
MINNESOTA ARE MOVING AHEAD

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.165
ALREADY STUDYING WITH THEIR

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.633
PROBLEMS ARE IN TRYING TO

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.202
ADDRESS THEM.

00:50:05.268 --> 00:50:07.104
THE SAME THING IS HERE -- THE

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.073
STATE IS NOT YET WORKING ON A

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:11.241
REGULATION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.343
THE DATA YET WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:16.279
HOW BROAD THIS PROBLEM IS AS YOU

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.715
JUST HEARD IT'S GOING TO BE VERY

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:20.884
BROAD THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:50:20.951 --> 00:50:21.518
THEY'RE DOING A GREAT JOB

00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:22.886
THEY'VE GOT IT GOOD SITE

00:50:22.953 --> 00:50:26.723
INVESTIGATION STARTED THIS YEAR.

00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:28.692
THIS BY A BILL BOTH BOLSTERS

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:28.992
THAT.

00:50:29.059 --> 00:50:32.195
FINALLY TRANSPARENCY IS

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.196
ESSENTIAL.

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.465
OUR PEOPLE HAVE THE BASIC RIGHT

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:37.200
TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S IN THEIR

00:50:37.267 --> 00:50:40.036
WATER SO IF -- WE ARE MONITORING

00:50:40.103 --> 00:50:41.204
THEIR SYSTEMS THEY SHOULD BE

00:50:41.271 --> 00:50:43.273
TOLD WHETHER THESE CHEMICALS ARE

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:44.474
THEY ARE WHAT THEY ARE.

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:47.544
THAT NOT ONLY IS HUMAN RIGHTS

00:50:47.611 --> 00:50:49.813
BUT IT ALSO BILLS ACTUALLY MORE

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:52.349
TRUST IN WATER -- PUBLIC WATER

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.117
PURVEYORS MANY OF WHOM ARE

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:56.153
TRYING TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN

00:50:56.219 --> 00:51:00.357
TO ADDRESS THESE KIND OF

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.591
MERCHANTS.

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:02.325
EXCUSE ME CONTAMINANTS SO WE

00:51:02.392 --> 00:51:02.893
THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.795
IMPORTANT PART OF THIS BILL AND

00:51:04.861 --> 00:51:06.663
OUR MEMBERS CALL FOR THAT KIND

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.031
OF TRANSPARENCY.

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:09.566
THAT'S WHY WE'RE SUPPORTING IT

00:51:09.633 --> 00:51:15.038
THANK YOU.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:17.574
OKAY OTHER FOLKS WHO WANT -- TO

AS MISS VENTURE POINTS OUT THESE

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.285
NEWER CHEMICALS ARE SERIOUS

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:30.287
BUSINESS A NEW REPORT JUST CAME

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:38.261
OUT OF FAST CHEMICALS AND

00:51:38.328 --> 00:51:40.297
PANCREATIC CANCER IN RODENTS.

00:51:40.363 --> 00:51:42.098
SO AS THE SCIENCE EMERGES WE

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.267
NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE

00:51:44.334 --> 00:51:47.237
USE OF THESE CHEMICALS THANK YOU

00:51:47.304 --> 00:51:47.537

ABOUT THE BILL OPPOSITION.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:11.928
WE CAN MAKE SOME SPACE FOR THEM.

00:52:11.995 --> 00:52:18.702
DRAW IT OFF AGO JUST.

00:52:18.768 --> 00:52:23.907

UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE

00:52:38.622 --> 00:52:39.189
ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER

00:52:39.256 --> 00:52:41.191
AGENTS HERE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.425
TO AB SEVEN FIVE SIX WANT TO

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:43.260
THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- FOR

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.160
HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH US AND

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.496
AND BEING OPEN -- TO SERVE OUR

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:46.763
FEEDBACK.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.398
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.002
OUR CONCERNS.

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:53.370
DURING FOR P. FAST.

00:52:53.436 --> 00:52:55.305
THIS IS A AS AS WAS DISCUSSED

00:52:55.372 --> 00:52:56.907
BEFORE THIS IS A CHEMICAL FOR

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:57.841
ART FOREVER CHEMICAL VERY

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:58.942
PREVALENT.

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:01.478
IN WATER SYSTEMS IN FOOD IT'S

00:53:01.545 --> 00:53:02.779
IT'S ME IN MANY PLACES.

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.548
I APPRECIATE THE COST WAS

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:06.750
BROUGHT UP -- WATER AGENCIES DID

00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:08.618
NOT CREATE THIS PROBLEM BUT WE

00:53:08.685 --> 00:53:10.754
DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.289
ADDRESSING IT AND THERE IS.

00:53:12.355 --> 00:53:14.324
SIGNIFICANT COSTS RELATED TO

00:53:14.391 --> 00:53:15.725
THAT.

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.027
WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO PUBLIC

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:18.595
NOTIFICATION PARTICULARLY

00:53:18.662 --> 00:53:19.896
THROUGH THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

00:53:19.963 --> 00:53:21.431
REPORTS AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE

00:53:21.498 --> 00:53:24.568
AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:25.435
OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS.

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:26.937
THEY DO MAKE THE BILL -- MUCH

00:53:27.003 --> 00:53:28.305
BETTER WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.040
FIXING AN ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUE

00:53:30.106 --> 00:53:31.975
WHICH I BELIEVE IS THE INTENT OF

00:53:32.042 --> 00:53:34.377
SUBSECTION A OF THE BILL --

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.745
REGARDING THE WATER BOARD AND

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:37.647
THEIR STORY TO ISSUE ORDERS TO

00:53:37.714 --> 00:53:38.982
MULTIPLE AGENCIES.

00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:40.684
WE WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THAT I

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:41.918
THINK THE LANGUAGE THAT HIS

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:43.920
IMPRINT IS MUCH MORE BROAD THAN

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:46.056
THAT GIVES THE BOARD A LOT MORE

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:48.825
AUTHORITY -- IN THAT REGARD.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:49.826
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.194
ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY GRANTED TO

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:52.329
THE BOARD.

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.763
UNDER EXISTING LAW THE BOARD

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:56.232
BEFORE THE ISSUE AN ORDER HAS TO

00:53:56.299 --> 00:53:57.434
DETERMINE POTENTIAL

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.868
CONTAMINATION.

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:01.304
OF A OF A WELL OR WATER SOURCE

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.073
UNDER THE LANGUAGE CRAFTED IN

00:54:03.139 --> 00:54:05.041
THE BILL THAT -- REQUIREMENT IS

00:54:05.108 --> 00:54:06.209
NOT THERE SO THE WATER BOARD CAN

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:07.477
SIMPLY REQUIRE EVERY WATER

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:09.279
AGENCY TO MONITOR FOR P. FAST WE

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.947
THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME.

00:54:11.014 --> 00:54:13.216
OF BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S

00:54:13.283 --> 00:54:15.652
CONTAMINATION.

00:54:15.719 --> 00:54:16.786
WE HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT WE

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.488
THINK WOULD RESOLVE THAT ISSUE

00:54:18.555 --> 00:54:21.124
AND WOOD -- REALLY FOCUS ON

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:23.326
AMENDING EXISTING LAW.

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:25.695
WE ALSO DON'T THINK THAT -- IT

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.030
WOULD IT'S BENEFICIAL TO HAVE

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:30.734
WATER AGENCIES REPORT ON WELLS --

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.502
FOUR OF FIVE YEARS EVEN AFTER

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.404
THOSE WELLS OR WATER SOURCES

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:34.938
HAVE BEEN CLEANED UP AND

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:36.906
ADDRESSED -- THE BILL WOULD

00:54:36.973 --> 00:54:39.676
REQUIRE CONTINUOUS -- REPORTING

00:54:39.743 --> 00:54:41.144
FOR FIVE YEARS -- IN CONSUMER

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:46.716
CONFIDENCE REPORTS -- OUR

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.418
PRIMARY CONCERN IS REALLY THE

00:54:48.485 --> 00:54:49.886
SEPARATE REGULATORY AUTHORITY

00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.554
AND NOTIFICATION PROCESS THAT'S

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.823
BEING CREATED SPECIFIC TO P. F.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:54:54.491
A. S..

00:54:54.557 --> 00:54:57.560
CHEMICALS -- AS AS MANY OF YOU

00:54:57.627 --> 00:54:59.796
ARE AWARE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT --

00:54:59.863 --> 00:55:02.032
WORK GOING ON ALREADY REGARDING

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.933
P. FAST AND CHEMICALS AT BOTH

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.268
THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL

00:55:05.335 --> 00:55:07.470
USEPA IS IN THE PROCESS OF

00:55:07.537 --> 00:55:08.338
MAKING A DISH AND THE SHOULDER

00:55:08.405 --> 00:55:10.440
OF DETERMINATION ON TO CHEMICALS

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:12.609
AS WAS STATED EARLIER -- WHO

00:55:12.676 --> 00:55:15.845
THEY BELIEVE TO USEPA SAYS THEY

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:16.446
WILL HAVE THIS DONE BY THE END

00:55:16.513 --> 00:55:16.780
OF THE YEAR?

00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:17.347
THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:18.181
BILLS MOVING THROUGH CONGRESS

00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:20.283
RELATED TO P. FAST THAT WOULD

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.351
EITHER EXPEDITE AND MCL.

00:55:21.418 --> 00:55:22.619
OR REQUIRE OTHER ADDITIONAL

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:25.188
REGULATION -- A NUMBER OF THESE

00:55:25.255 --> 00:55:27.323
HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT -- AND

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:28.591
SOMETHING MAY ACTUALLY HAPPEN ON

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:30.360
P. FAST REGULATION IN CONGRESS

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:32.395
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS I

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:34.464
KNOW THAT SOUNDS CRAZY -- IT

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.866
SOUNDS CRAZY TO SAY -- BUT IN

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:39.302
MARCH UNDER EXISTING WATER BOARD

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.438
AUTHORITY -- THEY INITIATED THIS

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:43.473
PHASED INVESTIGATION TO

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:45.842
DETERMINE THE SCOPE OF A P. FAST

00:55:45.909 --> 00:55:47.210
CONTAMINATION IT AND THEY

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.211
ORDERED.

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:50.346
AS WAS SAID EARLIER SIX HUNDRED

00:55:50.413 --> 00:55:51.881
SIXTY WELLS AND TWO HUNDRED NINE

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:55.618
WATER SYSTEMS -- TO TO TEST FOR

00:55:55.685 --> 00:55:56.920
A P. FPS CHEMICALS WE WILL BE

00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:58.788
TESTING OVER THE NEXT YEAR AND

00:55:58.855 --> 00:56:00.223
NUMBER OF THOSE ARE WITH.

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:01.858
AQUA MEMBER AGENCIES.

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:02.959
WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF

00:56:03.026 --> 00:56:04.427
TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE SCOPE OF

00:56:04.494 --> 00:56:05.829
THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.997
REALLY FULLY UNDERSTAND -- HOW

00:56:08.064 --> 00:56:11.835
HOW MANY WELLS AND SYSTEMS ARE

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:13.870
IMPACTED -- SO THEY WILL BE

00:56:13.937 --> 00:56:14.704
TESTING OVER THE NEXT YEAR IF

00:56:14.771 --> 00:56:15.905
THEY EXCEED NOTIFICATION LEVELS

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:17.273
THEY WILL REPORT THAT TO THEIR

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.744
GOVERNING BODIES -- THEY WILL --

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.612
THESE WILL GO INTO THE CONSUMER

00:56:22.679 --> 00:56:24.814
CONFIDENCE REPORT AS WELL -- AND

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.750
SO WE AGREE -- AGAIN WITH THE

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:28.284
COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT THAT

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:30.620
SAYS THAT IF A RESPONSE LEVEL IS

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:31.988
EXCEEDED THAT SHOULD ALSO GO

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.590
INTO THE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE

00:56:33.656 --> 00:56:34.991
REPORT THAT MAKES SENSE.

00:56:35.058 --> 00:56:37.227
BUT AGAIN A SEPARATE REGULATORY

00:56:37.293 --> 00:56:38.995
FRAMEWORK FOR P. FASS DOESN'T

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:40.430
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AND I KNOW IT

00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:43.032
SOUNDS CRAZY BUT WE WOULD ASK

00:56:43.099 --> 00:56:44.734
THAT IF WE'RE GONNA SAYS IF.

00:56:44.801 --> 00:56:46.636
PROCESS IS NOT WORKING -- IF

00:56:46.703 --> 00:56:49.005
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR P. FAST IF

00:56:49.072 --> 00:56:49.706
IT'S NOT WORKING FOR OTHER

00:56:49.773 --> 00:56:51.074
CONTAMINANTS LET'S CHANGE

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.575
EXISTING LAWS SO THAT IT DOES

00:56:52.642 --> 00:56:53.309
WORK.

00:56:53.376 --> 00:56:54.410
THAT'S NOT CREATE A SEPARATE

00:56:54.477 --> 00:56:56.379
REGULATORY STRUCTURE FOR ONE

00:56:56.446 --> 00:56:59.182
GROUP OF CONTAMINANTS -- FINALLY

00:56:59.249 --> 00:57:00.784
JUST A REALLY QUICK ASSEMBLY A

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:02.986
BILL EIGHT FOUR ONE BY -- MR

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:05.155
TANG -- THOUGH WE KNOW THAT BILL

00:57:05.221 --> 00:57:07.090
IS NOT MOVING THAT THE BILL WE

00:57:07.157 --> 00:57:08.258
ARE IN SUPPORT OF IT SET

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:10.527
TIMELINES FOR STATE AGENCIES TO

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:11.861
COMPLETE SOME WORK REGARDED.

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.530
REGARDING P. FAST WE SUPPORT

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:15.265
THAT EFFORT THEEXISTING PROCESS

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:16.766
IS VERY SCIENTIFIC VERY

00:57:16.833 --> 00:57:18.001
TECHNICAL.

00:57:18.067 --> 00:57:19.035
WE THINK THAT REGULATING

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:22.539
CONTAMINANTS LENDS ITSELF TO THE

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:24.040
REGULATORY PROCESS BETTER

00:57:24.107 --> 00:57:24.340
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:25.975
THANK YOU.

TO SHARE MANY OF THE CONCERNS

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:32.048
MOST NOTABLY THE SEPARATE P.

00:57:32.115 --> 00:57:33.349
FAST REGULATORY STRUCTURE.

00:57:33.416 --> 00:57:35.552
BUT THAT SAID WE ALSO VERY MUCH

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:36.419
APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AND THE

AUTHORS AMENDMENTS AND THE WATER

00:57:38.822 --> 00:57:40.356
DISTRICT WILL BE RE EVALUATING.

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:42.225
THE POSITION BUT WOULD HOPE TO

00:57:42.292 --> 00:57:45.361
HAVE THE SEPARATE REGULATORY

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:48.832

FROM ACQUIRING THE WATER SYSTEMS

00:58:50.393 --> 00:58:52.228
A TEST REVIEW THIS DOWN.

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:53.863
TO YOU KNOW AUTHORIZING THE

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:54.530
BOARD OR MONITORING I UNDERSTAND

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.399
YOU YOU YOU MAY BE WORRIED ABOUT

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.868
THAT BUT YOU'LL STILL BE AN

00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.370
AGENT WITH THE BOARD OVER.

00:59:00.436 --> 00:59:02.005
THE VALUE IN THE COST BENEFIT

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:03.673
ANALYSIS OF SEAT WITH DOING THAT

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:05.708
AYE AYES TO YOU KNOW THE BOARD

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:06.276
IS AN INTERESTING POINT AND

00:59:06.342 --> 00:59:07.777
WATER AGENCIES OUT OF BUSINESS

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:08.745
BUT THERE ALSO NEEDS TO MAKE

00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:11.681
SURE WE HAVE HIGH.

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:15.184
WATER QUALITY THAT RECEIPT THAT --

00:59:15.251 --> 00:59:17.120
THESE CHEMICAL PROBLEMS ARE OF

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.922
YOUR MAKING BY YOU CAN

00:59:18.988 --> 00:59:21.858
RESPONSIBILITIES OF I'D CLEAN

00:59:21.925 --> 00:59:22.058
WATER.

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:25.662
TO FOLKS -- SO I'M I'M.

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.263
I HEAR YOU I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.231
GONNA CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:30.199
AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN GET BUT I I

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:31.968
I'M FEELING.

00:59:32.035 --> 00:59:33.303
COMFORTABLE SUPPORT THE BILL THE

00:59:33.369 --> 00:59:34.737
DAIS.

00:59:34.804 --> 00:59:37.407
AS AMENDED -- OTHER QUESTIONS

00:59:37.473 --> 00:59:43.179
FROM THE MEMBERS.

00:59:43.246 --> 00:59:46.683
THE BILL OKAY -- OKAY ANY OTHER

00:59:46.749 --> 00:59:48.217
DISCUSSION NOW ALRIGHT I HAVE

00:59:48.284 --> 00:59:48.885
YOU MAY CLOSE.

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.420
OUT YES THEY DO ON A RESPOND TO

00:59:50.486 --> 00:59:51.721
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK

00:59:51.788 --> 00:59:52.422
YOU'D BE HERE FROM THEM THERE IS.

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:54.524
A LOT OF COMMON GROUND -- I

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.391
DON'T AGREE THAT WE ARE REALLY

00:59:55.458 --> 00:59:56.759
CREATING A SEPARATE REGULATORY

00:59:56.826 --> 00:59:57.894
PROCESSES WERE ST. TO THE WATER

00:59:57.961 --> 00:59:59.429
BOARD IS ALREADY LOOKING AT AT

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:00.496
LEAST TWO OF THESE CHEMICALS --

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:01.230
AS WE KNOW MOST ABOUT TO TREAT

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:01.898
HIM LIKE A FAMILY THERE ARE

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.533
FOREVER CHEMICALS WE KNOW THEY

01:00:03.599 --> 01:00:05.101
BEHAVE VERY SIMILARLY -- AND SO

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.703
WE DON'T HAVE TO RUN THROUGH.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:07.570
FIVE THOUSAND OF DIFFERENT

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:09.272
PROCESSES WE COULD.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.740
HAVE WON THAT THEY'RE ALREADY

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.075
WORKING OUR NOT INTERFERE IN THE

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:15.812
AND THAT PROCESS AT ALL

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.114
WHATSOEVER CRIME FAMILY.

01:00:18.181 --> 01:00:20.917
YES AT YOU KNOW I I THINK IT'S

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.352
MAYBE WORTH IN A CRIME FAMILY --

01:00:22.418 --> 01:00:23.519
FROM FROM THE EFFECTS OUT THERE --

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:24.187
YOU KNOW AND I FIND IT

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:25.788
INTERESTING THAT THEY SUPPORT MR

01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:27.190
TING THIS BILL THAT IS SPECIFIC

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.358
TO P. PHOSPHO IF THE SEPARATE

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.059
REGULATION WAS TRUE ARGUMENT.

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.328
THAT'S ALSO CREATING A SEPARATE

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.330
ELATION THERE ON P. -- FIVE AND

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.798
SO I I FIND THAT TO BE AN

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:39.102
INTERESTING ARGUMENT THERE I

01:00:39.168 --> 01:00:40.670
WOULD SAY THAT.

01:00:40.737 --> 01:00:41.871
ANY PROCESS WE HAVE CAN ALWAYS

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.206
BE IMPROVED AND SAVE THE M. CELL

01:00:43.272 --> 01:00:44.407
PROCESS THESE TO BE INPUT AT THE

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.242
STATE LEVEL THAT'S A DISCUSSION

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:47.010
THAT COULD BE HAD.

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:48.578
SEPARATELY I IN THE FUTURE

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:49.712
SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED TO I

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:50.913
WANT TO MAKE SET UP PROCESS IS

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.814
WORKING.

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.616
PROPERLY I LOOK AT OUR PROCESS

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:54.784
WITH CHROMIUM SIX AND THAT'S

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.019
TAKEN OVER A DECADE AND SO

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:57.153
THERE'S DEFINITELY IMPROVEMENTS

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.254
THAT CAN BE HAD.

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.356
I THINK WITH THIS BILL MY GOAL

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.524
IS TWO THINGS ONE TO RAISE

01:01:01.591 --> 01:01:03.393
AWARENESS WITH THE PUBLIC OF

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:04.727
WHAT P. FIVE IS.

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:06.829
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE JUST TRYING

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:08.798
TO LEARN ABOUT THIS -- INTO THAT

01:01:08.865 --> 01:01:10.500
THEY ARE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.368
DECISIONS IF YOU ARE PREGNANT

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.037
THERE'S A RECOMMENDATION THAT

01:01:14.103 --> 01:01:16.639
YOU DO NOT DRINK THIS WATER IF

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:17.340
YOU DO NOT KNOW.

01:01:17.407 --> 01:01:19.042
THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:21.477
DECISION -- I THINK THAT'S JUST

01:01:21.544 --> 01:01:22.879
ONE EXAMPLE OF OF NEEDING TO

01:01:22.945 --> 01:01:25.381
MAKE DECISIONS IF YOU KNOW THAT

01:01:25.448 --> 01:01:27.283
WE ARE AT A TRESTLE THAT SHOULD

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.751
BE THIS CLOSE TO THE GOVERNING.

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.653
BODY WHY SHOULD WE NOT DISCLOSE

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.422
IT TO THE CONSUMER AS WELL IN A

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:33.423
PROCESS THAT'S ALREADY BEING

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:34.323
USES CLOSE.

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:35.358
A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS TO THE

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.759
CONSUMERS OUT THERE THIS

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:38.728
CONSUMERS THAT WANT IT WILL USE

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:39.629
THAT INFORMATION AND THOSE THAT

01:01:39.695 --> 01:01:40.096
DON'T.

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:40.963
WILL DISCARD THE LETTER LIKE

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:42.632
THEY DO EVERY YEAR -- WITH THEIR

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:45.668
BILL OUT THERE THIS IS A SMALL

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.236
BILL IF HE ASKED ME FOR A REALLY

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.805
LARGE AND SCARY PROBLEM OUT

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:49.505
THERE.

01:01:49.572 --> 01:01:51.507
I RECOMMEND YOU ALL LOOK AT THE

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:53.309
DEVIL WE DON'T KNOW ON WILL BE

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:54.944
ON NETFLIX A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:55.478
THIS.

01:01:55.545 --> 01:01:57.513
THIS PROBLEM IS BAD ENOUGH THAT

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.516
WE HAVE -- RANCHERS IN THE STATE

01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.451
OF OUR CENTER LAB TO KILL

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:04.854
THOUSANDS OF CAL'S BECAUSE IT IS

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.689
A FOREVER CHEMICAL IN IT IF IT'S

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.425
IN YOUR WATER AND THEN LISTEN TO

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:09.992
YOUR FOOD SOURCE IN A STAYS

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:10.226
THERE.

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:12.328
IT'S POPPING UP AND THINGS LIKE --

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:14.330
CAKE -- THIS CAKE BAKING BOXES

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.332
OUT THERE -- IT'S IT'S POPPING

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:17.967
UP NOT TO THEIR PLACES IN A

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.368
WHILE ONE SMALL AMOUNT OF IN A

01:02:19.435 --> 01:02:21.304
BOX MAY SEEM LIKE NOT A BIG DEAL

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.705
BECAUSE IT THE FOREVER CHEMICAL

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.407
THAT SISTER IT ACCUMULATES.

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.142
INSIDE THE COMPOUND IT ISSUE

01:02:26.209 --> 01:02:27.076
THAT WERE BEING FACED WITH IT'S

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.378
IT'S PRETTY GREAT OUT THERE AND

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:29.879
SO.

01:02:29.946 --> 01:02:31.414
WE KNOW.

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:33.449
I WOULD SAY THAT AQUA AND THESE

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:34.650
OTHER WATER AGENCIES MIGHT HAVE

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:35.718
CONCERNS THAT ARE FOR A FIRST

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:45.394
LOOK AT THE P. FOSSE'S DANGEROUS

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:45.628
ENOUGH.

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:46.696
WE KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THIS

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:48.231
INFORMATION ABOUT THIS FAMILY

01:02:48.297 --> 01:02:49.165
EVEN THOUGH MORE AND MORE THE

01:02:49.232 --> 01:02:49.599
SCIENCES EMERGING.

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:50.700
THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING ACTION

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:51.501
I ALWAYS SAY IT'S CRIMINAL FOR

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:52.702
US TO SIT HERE AND SAY LET'S

01:02:52.768 --> 01:02:53.769
WAIT THIS WE KNOW THE TEN YEARS

01:02:53.836 --> 01:02:54.470
TO LEARN A LITTLE BIT MORE I

01:02:54.537 --> 01:02:55.872
LISTEN TO ME TO PUT COMMUNITIES

01:02:55.938 --> 01:02:56.506
IN DANGER.

01:02:56.572 --> 01:02:57.840
ON COMPETING AND CONTINUE TO PUT

01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:58.941
KIDS WHO ARE DEVELOPING IN

01:02:59.008 --> 01:02:59.675
DANGER WHILE WE FIGURE OUT A

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:00.476
LITTLE BIT MORE AND I FIND THAT

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.344
TO BE A CRIMINAL STAND SINCE I

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.778
RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR AN AYE

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:05.548
VOTE AND I I DO HOPE I SCARE

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:07.083
SOME OF THE TO GO LEARN A LITTLE

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:08.518
BIT MORE ABOUT THE SAME MAKING

01:03:08.584 --> 01:03:10.920

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:28.203
FRANKLY AND YEAH.

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:30.505
SO WHATEVER AGENCY IS THE ONE

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:31.640
THAT IS CERTAIN THE FINAL A

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:32.641
YOUNG GIRL WHO FOR CLASS

01:18:32.707 --> 01:18:34.076
MINISTRY OF PEACE FOR DOING SO

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.844
AND SO -- THE ULTIMATELY -- THIS

01:18:35.911 --> 01:18:39.748
IS NOT A ANY KIND OF SCHEME TO

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.450
RAISE FUNDS FOR CLEANING THE

01:18:41.516 --> 01:18:42.918
OCEANS ARE CLEAN PLASTIC IT'S

01:18:42.984 --> 01:18:44.853
REALLY A WAY TO KIND OF CHANGE

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.557
BEHAVIOR IN THE INDUSTRY

01:18:48.623 --> 01:18:49.591
INTERACTION THERE ARE YOU GOING.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:50.926
I THINK GOING FORWARD THAT NEEDS

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.794
TO BE A PRETTY CLEAR AND BECOME

01:18:52.861 --> 01:18:53.895
SOME FINDS THAT.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:55.030
ARE YOU KNOW ADMINISTERED AND

01:18:55.097 --> 01:18:56.565
FOR A VIOLATION OF THIS SECONDLY

01:18:56.631 --> 01:18:58.133
I HAPPEN TO LIVE IN A HOTEL.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:18:59.935
THAT HAS THESE DISPENSERS THEY

01:19:00.001 --> 01:19:03.438
ARE ACCESSIBLE BY. 8% -- IN THAT

01:19:03.505 --> 01:19:05.373
ROOM AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:06.875
GREAT CONCERNS AROUND --

01:19:06.942 --> 01:19:09.411
REGARDING THE PUBLIC SAFETY THAT

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:10.512
IS BEING PUT AT RISK.

01:19:10.579 --> 01:19:13.115
PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TENANTS IN

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:14.282
THE ROOM CAN ACCESS FEES

01:19:14.349 --> 01:19:16.685
DISPENSERS THEY ALSO NEED TO BE

01:19:16.751 --> 01:19:18.186
REFILLED YEAH I MEAN SOME OF

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:20.422
THIS IS A QUESTIONABLE REGARDING.

01:19:20.489 --> 01:19:22.324
THE SAFETY THE THE CLEANLINESS

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.192
OF ALL OF THAT SO I'M NOT SURE

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.760
THAT WE WE REALLY THOUGHT

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:26.795
THROUGH.

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.430
CAREFULLY HOW THERE MIGHT BE

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:29.364
ANOTHER KIND OF JUST ANSWER

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:30.899
THAT'S MORE RECYCLABLE THAN

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.401
PLASTIC MIGHT BE A BETTER CHOICE.

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:34.503
WE'VE SEEN THE RE RUSHING TO

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:35.904
THERE SO I WON'T BE ABLE TO

01:19:35.971 --> 01:19:37.305
SUPPORT IT TODAY.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.274
BUT I HOPE THAT ARE -- YOU KNOW

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.243
OUR TOURIST INDUSTRY WILL THINK

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:41.943
ABOUT THAT.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.578
ALL THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:19:43.645 --> 01:19:44.913
CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HEARD THEM

01:19:44.980 --> 01:19:46.815
JUST WITH THE PLASTIC BAGS THEY

01:19:46.882 --> 01:19:48.016
CAN BE CONTAMINATED SO YOU'RE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.085
ONLY SUPPOSED TO USE THEM ONE OR

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.019
TWO TIMES AND THEN DISPOSE OF

01:19:51.086 --> 01:19:51.686
THEM.

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:53.588
WE HAVE THESE LARGE BOTTLES THAT

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.490
CONTAIN BODY LOTION CONDITIONER

01:19:55.557 --> 01:19:57.125
AND SHAMPOO THEY'RE IN THEIR

01:19:57.192 --> 01:19:59.094
PLASTIC SO THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:00.462
DISPOSED OF AWFUL.

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:02.764
SO -- I THINK THERE MIGHT BE A

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.332
BETTER ANSWER SOMEWHERE IN THERE --

01:20:04.399 --> 01:20:06.268
AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:12.407
IS THE ANSWER FOR ME TODAY.

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:14.109
THANK.

01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:14.776
THINK ABOUT MY SHIRT AND I WOULD

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:15.544
JUST SAY THAT THIS IS ALREADY A

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.178
COMMON PRACTICE WHETHER YOU GO

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:16.811
TO A JAM WITH YOU GO ON A CRUISE

01:20:16.878 --> 01:20:17.746
SHIP WITH THE YOU GO TO MANY

01:20:17.812 --> 01:20:19.714
HOTELS ARE READY -- I I I WOULD

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:21.516
TRUST THE INDUSTRY AND VERY OUT

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:22.551
FOR EXAMPLES AND HAVE TO TWO

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.385
HUNDRED PROPERTY BUT THERE'S AND

01:20:23.451 --> 01:20:24.286
THIS YEAR THEY HAVE A LOT OF

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:25.687
LAWYERS HAVE A LOT OF PUBLIC

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:26.421
HEALTH EXPERTS.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.489
THAT ARE PART OF THE MARRIOTT

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:28.757
TEAM THAT I THINK THEY WOULDN'T

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:30.292
EVEN DARE TO STEP FORWARD IN ONE

01:20:30.358 --> 01:20:31.793
HOTEL UNLESS THEY BOTH THE

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.228
PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WOULD BE

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.095
SECURE BECAUSE IT'S THEIR

01:20:34.162 --> 01:20:35.597
LIABILITY AT REST SO.

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:36.631
I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT WITH

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:39.034
THIS BILL WILL SEE IMPROVEMENTS

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:39.601
IN INNOVATION IN TERMS OF

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.570

CONTAMINATION REDUCES THE

QUALITY OF OUR RECYCLABLES

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:53.768

TO MAKE NEW PRODUCTS.

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.196
AB EIGHT FIFTEEN WILL ENCOURAGE

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.997

OTHERS TO CONSIDER SWITCHING.

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.674
THIS BILL DOES NOT TAKE AWAY

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.210
LOCAL CONTROL OVER RECYCLING.

01:23:35.276 --> 01:23:37.579
AND IT DOES NOT GIVE CAL RECYCLE

01:23:37.645 --> 01:23:39.581

SIX YEARS -- I KNOWN OBJECTIVE --

01:26:35.557 --> 01:26:36.925
ANALYSIS WHEN I SEE WHEN I WANT

TO COMMEND COMMITTEE STAFFER

01:26:38.459 --> 01:26:39.827
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A VERY.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:42.463
FAIR AND BALANCED ASSESSMENT OF

01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:44.198
THE ISSUE.

01:26:44.265 --> 01:26:45.667
THE ISSUE OF DUAL STREAM IS A

01:26:45.733 --> 01:26:50.238
LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED -- WE

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:52.907
HAVE BY CAL RECYCLES BEST

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:54.442
ESTIMATE FROM WHAT THEY TELL ME

01:26:54.509 --> 01:26:56.010
ABOUT TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:57.378
IMPLYING THIS PARTICULAR

01:26:57.445 --> 01:26:59.147
TECHNOLOGY TODAY.

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:01.449
WHICH MEANS THE MORE THAN FIVE

01:27:01.516 --> 01:27:02.016
HUNDRED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:02.884
DON'T.

01:27:02.951 --> 01:27:04.586
SOME OF THE BEEN MIGRATED AS I

01:27:04.652 --> 01:27:06.254
THINK PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:07.221
REFLECTS.

01:27:07.288 --> 01:27:09.457
FROM DUAL STREAM TO A SINGLE

01:27:09.524 --> 01:27:11.192
STREAM FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:12.694
I AM WILLING TO CONCEDE TO THE

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.462
COMMITTEE TODAY THE DUAL STREAM

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:16.097
CAN YIELD.

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:17.932
AN OUTCOME THAT RESULTS IN LESS

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:20.268
CONTAMINATION BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.936
ONLY THING WE LOOK AT WHEN WE

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:24.806
BUILT THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR.

01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:26.541
WASTE RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:27:26.608 --> 01:27:28.076
THAT EXISTS TODAY IT'S ALSO

01:27:28.142 --> 01:27:29.444
ABOUT VOLUME.

01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:30.945
AND MOVING A HECK OF A LOT OF

01:27:31.012 --> 01:27:33.348
MATERIAL THROUGH THE PRIOR TO

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:33.982
NINETEEN NINETY WAS NOT GETTING

01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:34.749
RECYCLED AT ALL.

01:27:34.816 --> 01:27:38.252
SO WERE CONFRONTED WITH IS THIS.

01:27:38.319 --> 01:27:39.654
HUNDREDS OF HOLDERS OF

01:27:39.721 --> 01:27:41.556
CONSIDERED AND REJECTED BY IN BY

01:27:41.623 --> 01:27:43.658
NOT IMPLEMENTING THIS SYSTEM IN

01:27:43.725 --> 01:27:45.059
FAVOR OF ANOTHER SYSTEM.

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:47.028
NOW RESPONSE I GET TO THAT IS

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:48.796
WHAT THIS BILL DOESN'T COMPEL

01:27:48.863 --> 01:27:50.365
ANYTHING.

01:27:50.431 --> 01:27:51.933
BUT A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE ALSO

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.800
TRUE.

01:27:52.867 --> 01:27:54.369
NOTHING PROHIBITS THE CITY OR

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.603
COUNTY FROM ADOPTING DUAL STREAM

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:57.071
RECYCLING TODAY AND A HANDFUL

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:58.339
HAVE.

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:00.008
NOTHING PREVENTS CAL RECITE FROM

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:00.975
CONSIDERING DAHLE STREAM

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:02.176
RECYCLING AS PART OF A GOOD

01:28:02.243 --> 01:28:04.646
FAITH EFFORT TERMINATION TODAY

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:06.114
WITHOUT EXPRESSLY CALLING ON THE

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:07.181
CRITERIA.

01:28:07.248 --> 01:28:08.883
AND WHAT EIGHT FIFTEEN DOES IS

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:10.485
IT BREAKS NEW GROUND BY SAYING

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:12.487
NO THE EXISTING -- BUT BY SAYING

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:13.855
THAT THIS PARTICULAR CRITERIA IT

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.223
MERITS BEING CALLED OUT WHEN

01:28:15.289 --> 01:28:16.824
NONE OF THE OTHER CRITERIA FOR A

01:28:16.891 --> 01:28:18.259
GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO TERMINATION

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.728
INVOLVES AN OPERATIONAL DECISION.

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:23.931
ABOUT WHAT SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:24.332
TO USE.

01:28:24.399 --> 01:28:25.600
WE WOULD ALSO RESPECTFULLY

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.001
SUBMIT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT

01:28:27.068 --> 01:28:28.636
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT INCENTIVIZE

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:30.805
INDUSTRY BUT THIS TIME WE NEED

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:32.440
TO STUDY IT GOES BEYOND.

01:28:32.507 --> 01:28:33.708
THE VERY ANECDOTAL INFORMATION

01:28:33.775 --> 01:28:35.510
THAT'S AVAILABLE TODAY SOMETHING

01:28:35.576 --> 01:28:37.111
THAT MAKES ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT

01:28:37.178 --> 01:28:38.513
THAT NOT JUST WEALTHY.

01:28:38.579 --> 01:28:39.714
COMMUNITIES WITH A HOMOGENEOUS

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:41.282
POPULATION CAN IMPLEMENT TO

01:28:41.349 --> 01:28:43.084
SUCCESSFULLY THAT ALSO WORK IN

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.719
RIALTO THAT WILL ALSO WORK IN

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:47.622
RIVERSIDE -- OR 95% THIS STATE

01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:49.223
THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY USES SO

01:28:49.290 --> 01:28:50.958
WE'RE NOT AGAINST IT WE WE WOULD

01:28:51.025 --> 01:28:52.760
BECOME CONCERNED WITH A

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:55.329
PARTICULAR -- AND TO THIS.

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:58.099
EXTENT UNPOPULAR A METHODOLOGY

01:28:58.166 --> 01:28:59.634
GAINES AN INCENTIVE AND WHY DO

01:28:59.701 --> 01:29:00.768
WE CARE.

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.737
BECAUSE INCENTIVES HAVE A NASTY

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:04.472
HABIT OF BECOMING PREFERENCES

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:05.606
AND FROM PURPOSES IT BECOME

01:29:05.673 --> 01:29:06.674
GOALS AND GOALS A BECOME

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:07.775
MANDATES.

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:09.410
WE ARE VERY MUCH OPEN AS AN

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:11.112
INDUSTRY TO HAVING A THOUGHTFUL

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.947
CONVERSATION ON THE ISSUE WE'RE

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:14.649
VERY MUCH OPEN TO A STUDY.

01:29:14.716 --> 01:29:18.886
THAT LOOKS AT DIVERSE AREAS OF

01:29:18.953 --> 01:29:19.987
THE STATE.

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:20.588
BUT AT THE TIME WHEN WHEN OUR

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:21.222
FOLKS ARE TRYING TO DEFEND THE

01:29:21.289 --> 01:29:22.523
CURRENT OPERATION GROWN EXPAND

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.058
THEIR FACILITIES.

01:29:24.125 --> 01:29:25.393
THE IDEA THAT THESE STATES GOING

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.128
TO SUBSIDIZE OWN JUDGMENT WHEN

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.496
THERE ISN'T EVEN AMPLE EVIDENCE

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:30.198
TO SUPPORT THIS AS BEING A

01:29:30.264 --> 01:29:32.166
PREFERRED TECHNOLOGY WE THINK

01:29:32.233 --> 01:29:33.735
IT'S ON WHY STEP WE DO ON THE

01:29:33.801 --> 01:29:35.503
OTHER HAND. ONE RECOGNIZE

01:29:35.570 --> 01:29:36.804
SOMETHING VERY POSITIVE ABOUT

01:29:36.871 --> 01:29:37.705
THIS BILL.

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:39.674
I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF LAST

01:29:39.741 --> 01:29:40.875
YEAR TRYING TO GET.

01:29:40.942 --> 01:29:43.077
THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND

01:29:43.144 --> 01:29:43.644
THAT WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:44.879
NATIONAL SORT.

01:29:44.946 --> 01:29:46.280
AND SO HE IDEATHAT THIS AUTHOR

01:29:46.347 --> 01:29:48.149
HAS DECIDED TO TAKE UP SOME OF

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:49.917
THAT MANTLE IS VERY PLEASING TO

01:29:49.984 --> 01:29:51.552
US WE WERE MUCH WE'RE ALSO

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.721
GRATEFUL FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY

01:29:53.788 --> 01:29:55.223
EFFORT PUT FORWARD BY HER STEP

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:57.258
IN TRYING TO REACH A COMPROMISE.

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.659
I THINK I SAID DURING BACK HERE.

01:29:58.726 --> 01:30:00.428
WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THIS

01:30:00.495 --> 01:30:01.996
WE'RE JUST NOT THERE YET SO

01:30:02.063 --> 01:30:03.064
WE'RE GONNA HEAR WILL MOVE THE

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.332
BILL FORWARD AND I UNDERSTAND

01:30:04.398 --> 01:30:05.666
ALL THAT BUT I'D SURE LIKE THIS

01:30:05.733 --> 01:30:06.667
FIXED.

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:08.069
BECAUSE I HATE TO SEE RECYCLERS

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:10.404
DEBATING EACH OTHER ABOUT WHICH

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:12.106
TECHNOLOGY OUGHT TO BE PREFERRED

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:13.574
LET'S GET BETTER INFORMATION AS

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.876
TO A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY AND

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.611
THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHETHER

01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.045
GOOD FAITH EFFORT.

01:30:18.112 --> 01:30:19.881
CRITERIA SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE

01:30:19.947 --> 01:30:21.516
MODIFIED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

THANK YOU FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL

01:30:29.023 --> 01:30:30.124

[INAUDIBLE]

01:30:30.491 --> 01:30:35.630
OKAY -- I MEAN I DO WHAT I WILL.

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:36.998

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:38.699
THE DAY.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:41.302
THE BILL IS ASKING FOR CAROL TO

01:30:41.369 --> 01:30:45.640
CONSIDER -- YEAH SO IT'S IT'S

01:30:45.706 --> 01:30:47.441
NOT A IT'S NOT DISPOSITIVE I I

01:30:47.508 --> 01:30:48.776
GET THAT THERE'S A CONCERN ABOUT

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:49.944
THE SLIPPERY SLOPE BUT YOU KNOW

01:30:50.011 --> 01:30:51.045
YOU CAN MAKE THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.547
NEARLY ANY BILL THAT PASSED IN

01:30:52.613 --> 01:30:57.285
THIS LEGISLATURE -- SO. FIVE

01:30:57.351 --> 01:31:00.021
WITH THAT I'M I'M CERTAINLY --

01:31:00.087 --> 01:31:01.389
AFTER WITH THE BILL TODAY.

01:31:01.455 --> 01:31:02.190
IN PASSING ON TO APPROPRIATIONS

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:03.191
COMMITTEE BILL IT'S PRETTY BACK

01:31:03.257 --> 01:31:05.026
TO THE COMMITTEE AND THAT'S OUR

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:05.660
OTHER FOLKS WANNA RAISE CONCERNS

01:31:05.726 --> 01:31:07.328
OPPOSITION.

01:31:07.395 --> 01:31:11.299
OKAY -- TELECAST I GUESS -- ALAS

01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:12.700
THE AUTHOR'S DATA SUPPORTING THE

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:14.902
CHANGE AND OTHERS A MILL VALLEY

01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:16.370
PILOT PROGRAM IS THAT.

01:31:16.437 --> 01:31:19.941
TRANSFERABLE TO LA AND WHAT WE

01:31:20.007 --> 01:31:21.175
HAVE ON THE DATA.

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:22.877
AGENDA WELL FIRST OF ALL THERE

01:31:22.944 --> 01:31:24.612
ARE -- TWENTY ONE JURISDICTIONS

01:31:24.679 --> 01:31:26.781
THAT USE DUAL STREAM TODAY SO WE

01:31:26.848 --> 01:31:27.481
DO HAVE SOME DATA THAT'S OUT

01:31:27.548 --> 01:31:30.418
THERE -- MILL VALLEY DID DO A A

01:31:30.484 --> 01:31:32.687
PILOT PROGRAM THAT THEY DEEMED

01:31:32.753 --> 01:31:34.522
VERY SUCCESSFUL YES IS IT A MORE

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:36.090
LEAGUE MAYBE COMMUNITY THAN

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:37.625
OTHERS BUT WE GOT TO START

01:31:37.692 --> 01:31:38.759
SOMEWHERE AND I THINK THAT WE

01:31:38.826 --> 01:31:40.494
HAVE REALLY GOOD EXAMPLES WHEN

01:31:40.561 --> 01:31:41.095
YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:41.829
JUPITER'S.

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:43.431
JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE USING IT

01:31:43.497 --> 01:31:44.198
NOW.

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:46.534
REMEMBER IS THAT I'M MY HEART

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:47.401
GOES OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE

01:31:47.468 --> 01:31:49.904
GONE DOWN ONE OF PATH ARE

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:51.973
RECYCLERS WHEN I WENT TO SINGLE

01:31:52.039 --> 01:31:53.174
STREAM.

01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.176
AND NOW SWITCHED TO DUAL STREAM --

01:31:55.243 --> 01:31:56.577
WE'RE GIVING THE LOCALS THE

01:31:56.644 --> 01:31:58.312
OPPORTUNITY TO SIDE WHICH WHICH

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.214
WAY THEY WANT TO GO -- AND I

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.415
THINK IT IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.184
A LANDFILL RECENTLY WE'VE GOT TO

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.018
DO SOMETHING.

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:06.120
AND NOT USING THESE RECYCLABLE

01:32:06.187 --> 01:32:08.890
MATERIALS FOR OTHER PRODUCTS IS --

01:32:08.956 --> 01:32:11.392
A COMMENDABLE FOR US TO TO GO

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.360
DOWN THAT ROUTE AND WHO WOULDN'T

01:32:12.426 --> 01:32:15.663
ON WE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN THIS

01:32:15.730 --> 01:32:16.831
GOING DOWN THIS PATH. FIFTEEN

01:32:16.898 --> 01:32:17.531
YEARS AGO BUT WE ARE.

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:18.866
AND WE NEED TO START SOMEWHERE

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:19.634
SO.

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:22.169
I GUESS I GUESS THEY FOLLOW UP

01:32:22.236 --> 01:32:25.139
MISTER CHAIR IS IS COULD THIS.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.440
CITIES CAN THIS LEAD. TO TO

01:32:26.507 --> 01:32:27.108
CONTAMINATED PENS THAT WE HAVE

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:30.011

HOMEOWNERS OUT DON'T.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:33.080
HAVE PRACTICE THE BEST PRACTICES

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.649
I MEAN I KOW THAT'S A PROBLEM

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.384
WITH THE CURRENTLY WHAT WE HAVE

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:38.686
A CONTAMINATED AND WE JUST.

01:32:38.753 --> 01:32:42.023
DUPLICATING THE SAME PROBLEM.

01:32:42.089 --> 01:32:42.657
WITHOUT THE EDUCATION

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:42.957

THEY'RE GONNA BE LAZY AND WITH.

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:55.503
THE THE FACT IS UNIT IN. TWO

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.972
MINUTES ACTUALLY HELP HELP THE

01:32:58.039 --> 01:32:59.173
EDUCATION SO.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.608
YOU KNOW TO BE A BE A LOT EASIER

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:01.842
IF YOU'RE CONSUMER YOU'RE NOT

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:04.946

FORECAST WEATHER STEVEN

01:33:07.748 --> 01:33:09.350
RECYCLABLE YOU'LL NOTICE

01:33:09.417 --> 01:33:11.185
RECYCLABLE BECAUSE A GLASS

01:33:11.252 --> 01:33:12.720
BOTTLE IS RECYCLABLE.

01:33:12.787 --> 01:33:14.889
IS A IS A IS A DIRTY PIZZA

01:33:14.956 --> 01:33:17.358
CARTON RECYCLABLE WILL NOW AND

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:18.259
IT SHOULDN'T GO ANY IT SHOULDN'T

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:20.394
GO IN EITHER BEEN AND SHOULD GO

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.997
IN THE GARBAGE BUT YOU KNOW --

AND AND JUST ON THE ON ON ON THE

01:33:25.099 --> 01:33:27.535
STUDIES -- I I MEAN OBVIOUSLY

01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:28.669
THAT THE WASTE INDUSTRIES GONNA

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:34.041
KNOW THIS BETTER THAN I DO --

01:33:34.108 --> 01:33:36.610
THE THE WASTE INDUSTRY HAS KNOWN

01:33:36.677 --> 01:33:38.312
THE PROBLEM OF OF OF THE AFTER

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:40.381
MARKET OF OF THE OF THE OF THE

01:33:40.448 --> 01:33:41.816
CURBSIDE.

01:33:41.882 --> 01:33:42.416
AMINATION PROBABLY GONNA FOR A

01:33:42.483 --> 01:33:43.818
LONG TIME IT JUST HASN'T

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:46.520
MATTERED IT NOW MATTERS AND SO

01:33:46.587 --> 01:33:47.621
IF THEY IF IF IF IF THEY WERE

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:49.123
PAIRED TO DEAL WITH THIS ON

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.157
THEIR OWN.

01:33:50.224 --> 01:33:52.593
AND AND IN TWENTY TWELVE OR

01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:54.195
TWENTY THIRTEEN WHEN THAT WIND

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:56.097
WHEN CHINA OPERATED THE YOU KNOW

01:33:56.163 --> 01:33:58.599
PUT IN GREEN FENCE.

01:33:58.666 --> 01:33:59.100
WE WOULD BE HAVING THIS

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.201
DISCUSSION BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:34:00.267 --> 01:34:01.369
THEY'RE MOVING SLOW AND AND

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:02.770
NOBODY'S EXPECTING ANYTHING TO

01:34:02.837 --> 01:34:03.904
HAPPEN OVERNIGHT NOBODY'S GONNA

DISADVANTAGES.

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.875
IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT TO FOR LOCAL

01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:09.210
GOVERNMENTS TO MAKE AN INFORMED

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:11.312
DECISION WITH THEIR HOLLERS AND

01:34:11.379 --> 01:34:12.313
AND WITH THEIR MURDERS ON

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.347
CONTRACTS AND THEY'RE GONNA

01:34:13.414 --> 01:34:15.249
RENEW OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW TEN

FIFTEEN YEARS AND AND AND AND

01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:18.352
IT'LL ALL IT'LL IT'LL SORT

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:19.854
ITSELF OUT OF THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.121
CAN SOME.

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:23.524
VERY MODEST BILL THAT ENCOURAGES.

01:34:23.591 --> 01:34:24.825
YOU KNOW THE IDEA OF DAHLE FREE

01:34:24.892 --> 01:34:26.360
RECYCLING IN EVERYBODY WILL DO

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:31.098
THEIR OWN STUDY WHEN THEY MAKE

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:34.869
THAT DECISION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

01:34:34.935 --> 01:34:35.169
[INAUDIBLE]

01:34:35.236 --> 01:34:40.908
MR. THREE CHAIR IF IF AFTER THE

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:43.611
SALE IS OUR GUEST.

01:34:43.677 --> 01:34:44.211
I'M SURE THAT THE WASTE

01:34:44.278 --> 01:34:44.845
INDUSTRIES VERY GRATEFUL TO THE

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.247
GLASS INDUSTRY FOR HELPING US

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:46.947
FIGURE OUT OUR JOB.

01:34:47.014 --> 01:34:49.283
OF LET ME SAY THIS IF ONE BILLS

01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:50.818
OF MATERIALS RECOVERY FACILITY

01:34:50.885 --> 01:34:52.053
TODAY TO MANAGE JUST MATERIAL

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:52.953
ONE'S GOING TO SPEND ON THE

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.889
ORDER OF TWENTY TO THIRTY

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:56.590
MILLION DOLLARS ON AVERAGE.

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.225
THAT IS PAID FOR OVER A TERM

01:34:58.292 --> 01:35:00.461
THAT APPROXIMATES TWENTY TO

01:35:00.528 --> 01:35:02.430
THIRTY YEARS TO LESSEN THE

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.464
IMPACT ON RATE PAYERS.

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.633
THOSE FACILITIES ARE OPERATED

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:08.969
BASED ON PRE TWO THOUSAND

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:09.470
THIRTEEN PRE GREEN FENCE

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:10.171
TECHNOLOGY.

01:35:10.237 --> 01:35:12.339
MASSIVE THROUGHPUT EXTRAORDINARY

01:35:12.406 --> 01:35:13.908
CONTENT EXTRAORDINARY A

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.409
COLLECTION RESULTS OR AND

01:35:15.476 --> 01:35:17.678
RECOVERY RESULTS BUT NOT AS GOOD

01:35:17.745 --> 01:35:19.213
IF WE SLOWED EVERYTHING DOWN.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.182
PICKED IT UP ITEM BY ITEM AND

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:22.383
SPENT TWO OR THREE HUNDRED BUCKS

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:23.818
A MONTH ON EACH HOUSE RECYCLING

01:35:23.884 --> 01:35:25.586
THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WITH

01:35:25.653 --> 01:35:27.188
THE EFFICIENCIES WERE BROUGHT TO

01:35:27.254 --> 01:35:29.056
BEAR IS RESULT OF NINE THIRTY

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.124
NINE WE LOST A LITTLE SOMETHING

01:35:30.191 --> 01:35:31.826
IN TERMS OF CONTAMINATION BUT WE

01:35:31.892 --> 01:35:33.327
PICKED UP EXTRAORDINARY GAINS.

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:35.029
IN TERMS OVER OVERALL VOLUME IN

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:37.098
CHINA IN THE FAR EAST WERE

01:35:37.164 --> 01:35:38.099
ACCEPTING ALL OF THIS JUST THE

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:38.766
WHAT.

01:35:38.833 --> 01:35:40.734
WE WE PROCESS TO THE DEGREE THAT

01:35:40.801 --> 01:35:42.269
THE MARKET WILL BEAR THE MARKET

01:35:42.336 --> 01:35:44.371
BOARD UNTIL A YEAR AGO SO WE ALL

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:45.573
ACKNOWLEDGE WE'RE DIFFERENT

01:35:45.639 --> 01:35:47.074
STATE OF AFFAIRS NOW WE'RE

01:35:47.141 --> 01:35:48.242
ADJUSTING TO THAT.

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:49.210
BUT THE IDEA THAT THE

01:35:49.276 --> 01:35:50.978
LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO STEP IN

01:35:51.045 --> 01:35:52.213
WITH A PREFERENCE OR INSTEAD OF

01:35:52.279 --> 01:35:53.447
GETS ITS DECIDED.

01:35:53.514 --> 01:35:54.782
BASED ON I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE

01:35:54.849 --> 01:35:56.817
STUDY. ONE OF THE THREE STUDIES

01:35:56.884 --> 01:35:59.487
CITED TO ME SAMPLE THIRTEEN OF A

01:35:59.553 --> 01:36:03.924
HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN MERSON

01:36:03.991 --> 01:36:04.692
CALIFORNIA REALLY.

01:36:04.758 --> 01:36:05.759
ARE WE PREPARED TO GO THERE YET

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.695
ON THAT STUDY MILL VALLEY I WISH

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:08.762
I LIVED THERE WILL MOST

01:36:08.829 --> 01:36:09.997
BEAUTIFUL PLACES IN THE WORLD.

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:10.965
BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE AT ALL

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.466
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT THE

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:13.667
INDUSTRY NEEDS TO DEAR WHAT

01:36:13.734 --> 01:36:15.469
OTHER CITIES WITH DIFFERENT

01:36:15.536 --> 01:36:17.204
CONSTRAINTS ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:17.471
DO.

01:36:17.538 --> 01:36:19.707
SLAP OPAL.

01:36:19.773 --> 01:36:21.408
END OF THE STUDY OUT OF ONTARIO

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:22.510
CANADA.

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:24.111
I READ THE AT LEAST THE

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:27.882
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THAT I'VE GOT-MY PEOPLE LOOKING AT IT.

01:36:27.948 --> 01:36:28.916
UNDERSTAND ONE THING AND ALL

01:36:28.983 --> 01:36:31.519
STOP TALKING [INAUDIBLE]

01:36:31.585 --> 01:36:34.288
ENTREPRENEURS.

01:36:34.355 --> 01:36:36.423
ISN'T THERE ARE LEFT IN THE

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:37.925
POSITION OF GREATEST RISK IF

01:36:37.992 --> 01:36:39.493
THEY MAKE THE WRONG CHOICE.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.961
THEY WANT MORE THAN ANYBODY SO

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.696
IT'S NOT EVEN JUST ALTRUISM ON

01:36:42.763 --> 01:36:44.565
THEIR PART IT'S THE ECONOMIC

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:46.367
REALITY UP IF THEY DON'T DELIVER

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:47.835
THE OUTCOMES THAT ARE REQUIRED

01:36:47.902 --> 01:36:49.670
THE LOSE THE CONTRACT THEY DON'T

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.605
GET TO REPAY THE BOND ON THE

01:36:51.672 --> 01:36:52.640
FACILITY IT'S IS NO MORE

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:54.074
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:55.709
IF THIS WERE THE ANSWER THEY'D

01:36:55.776 --> 01:36:57.711
BE DOING IT FIVE HUNDRED PLUS

01:36:57.778 --> 01:36:59.513
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT YET

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.114
DOING IT.

01:37:00.181 --> 01:37:01.649
SHOULD THEY MIGRATE TO THAT

01:37:01.715 --> 01:37:02.883
PERHAPS LET'S HAVE A

01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:04.585
CONVERSATION THAT STUDY BUT TO

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.253
START OURSELVES DOWN THE PATH

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.821
BECAUSE GLASS FEELS IT'S A GOOD

01:37:07.888 --> 01:37:08.656
IDEA.

01:37:08.722 --> 01:37:09.924
BY THE WAY THE DEFINITION OF

01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:11.192
DUAL STREAMING HERE DON'T EVEN

01:37:11.258 --> 01:37:13.694
MENTION GLASS THEY'RE TALKING

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:14.929
ABOUT REMOVING PAPER.

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:16.463
AND SEPARATELY DEALING WITH THAT

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.565
PAPER DOES NOT AND TO

01:37:17.631 --> 01:37:19.066
CONTAMINATE GLASS THAT'S NOT

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:20.100
THEIR ISSUE.

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:21.468
THERE ISSUES BOTTLE CAPS AND A

01:37:21.535 --> 01:37:23.337
HOST OF OTHER THINGS WE CAN GET

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:24.605
CLEANER WE CAN DO A LOT OF

01:37:24.672 --> 01:37:25.839
DIFFERENT THINGS BUT WE'RE

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:27.308
JUMPING THE GUN HERE THE

01:37:27.374 --> 01:37:28.776
EVIDENCE IS NOT IN THE BILL'S TO

01:37:28.842 --> 01:37:30.077
THAT EXTENT.

01:37:30.144 --> 01:37:31.478
PREMATURE THANK YOU.

01:37:31.545 --> 01:37:33.214
MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:35.015
BILL AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE

01:37:35.082 --> 01:37:36.951
INDUSTRY THAT ONCE CLEANER

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:37.985
COLLECT COULD.

01:37:38.052 --> 01:37:39.987
WORK WITH US TO GET THE SPIRITS

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:42.723
IN THE WIND INDUSTRY IN THE

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.525
BOTTLE BILLS.

01:37:44.592 --> 01:37:45.626
ALL PARTICIPATING EQUALLY --

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:48.729
WORK AS A BETTER STREAM SO WITH

01:37:48.796 --> 01:37:51.899
THAT ALMOST.

01:37:51.966 --> 01:37:53.334
I KNOW THAT JOBS OFFICES WORKING

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:54.835
WITH OPPOSITION ON SNAPCHAT LE

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:55.736
LET RULING SOME ISSUES AND REYES

01:37:55.803 --> 01:37:59.540
MEANING THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE

01:37:59.607 --> 01:38:00.107
HELPFUL ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE

01:38:00.174 --> 01:38:00.507
FACT THAT.

01:38:00.574 --> 01:38:01.542
I THINK SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:02.509
ARE VERY LEGITIMATE BUT THEIR

01:38:02.576 --> 01:38:04.044
THEIR BROADER THAN THE THE

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:06.046
BIGGER THE SCOPE OF THE BILL

01:38:06.113 --> 01:38:06.714
THEN THE SCOPE OF THE WILL BILLS

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.849
WRITTEN SO -- WITHOUT I'M

01:38:08.916 --> 01:38:10.251
CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE FOR THAT

01:38:10.317 --> 01:38:11.652
MISSED MINIMIZED HER I JUST WANT

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:14.622
TO THINK OF THE REPRESENTATIVE

01:38:14.688 --> 01:38:16.090
FOR THE RECYCLING INDUSTRY ON

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:19.059
THAT I THINK HE'S RAPPORT THE

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.861
CONCERNS THAT I WOULD HAVE FOR

01:38:20.928 --> 01:38:25.332
MY SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY.

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:26.634
WE STARTED THE NUMBER.

01:38:26.700 --> 01:38:27.501
RIGHT OUT WE WERE NEWLY

01:38:27.568 --> 01:38:27.968
INCORPORATED CITIES.

01:38:28.035 --> 01:38:29.303
BASED ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:30.337
DO WE'VE BEEN MEETING OUR

01:38:30.404 --> 01:38:32.239
REQUIREMENT AND I'M CONCERNED

01:38:32.306 --> 01:38:33.107
THAT WITH THE PRESCRIPTIVE

01:38:33.173 --> 01:38:34.308
NATURE OF THE FROM THE AND

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:35.576
SENTENCE OF DEATH.

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.978
THAT COULD START TO CAUSE CITIES

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.813
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT

01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.548
NOW ABOUT THIRTY FOUR CITIES IN

01:38:41.615 --> 01:38:42.249
ORANGE COUNTY THAT COULD BE

01:38:42.316 --> 01:38:42.916
AFFECTED.

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.485
WITH FIVE NEW REQUIREMENTS AND

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:47.688
NOT MEETING -- DIVERSION SO

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:49.323
MAYBE A SLOWER PACE WITH SOME OF

01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:50.991
THE CONCERNS THAT MR ANSWERS

01:38:51.058 --> 01:38:54.094
ROUTE FORWARD -- REALLY MERIT --

01:38:54.161 --> 01:38:55.496
CONSIDERATION AS THIS MOVES

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:57.364
FORWARD SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING

01:38:57.431 --> 01:38:59.533
IT TODAY -- BUT I WANT YOU KNOW

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:01.001
INCORPORATING WITHIN THE GAL

01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.269
THIRTY YEARS AGO WHICH I WAS

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:03.937
VERY INVOLVED WITH WE'VE DONE A

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:06.006
HECK OF A JOB ON DEATH AND ARE

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:07.107
CITIES IN THE EDUCATION THAT'S

01:39:07.174 --> 01:39:08.575
GONNA IS MEN INCREDIBLE.

01:39:08.642 --> 01:39:10.044
SO WHERE EDUCATION NEED FOR THE

01:39:10.110 --> 01:39:11.111
LAWN WE NEED TO GIVE THE

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.813
RECYCLING INDUSTRY A LITTLE MORE

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.814
TIME.

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.149
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE COST OF

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:17.051
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK ABOUT THE

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:18.452
MATCH THAT I'VE VISITED.

01:39:18.519 --> 01:39:20.287
THAT WOULD BE ON PUT ON RATE

01:39:20.354 --> 01:39:22.423
PAYERS -- BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY

01:39:22.489 --> 01:39:23.924
IT WOULD HAVE TO GO AND SOME NOT

01:39:23.991 --> 01:39:25.225
CONTINUE IN THEIR CONTRACTS

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.226
BECAUSE OF THAT.

01:39:26.293 --> 01:39:27.561
SO THERE ARE CONCERNS

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:30.264
SIGNIFICANT ONES BUT SOUNDS TO

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:31.565

MY DISTRICT AND MY PEOPLE WHO

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:39.006
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

01:39:39.073 --> 01:39:39.506
IF THIS.

01:39:39.573 --> 01:39:42.209

THERE'S THERE NOW THIS IS

01:56:52.305 --> 01:56:53.706
BROUGHT UP THIS OPTION ONE

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:54.974
OPTION TO ISSUE.

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:56.909
YES I AM ANY COMMENTS ON THAT IN

01:56:56.976 --> 01:56:59.812
TERMS OF I I JUST NED TO GET MY

01:56:59.879 --> 01:57:00.413
HEAD AROUND WHAT THE

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.181
IMPLICATIONS OF THE OF THE

01:57:02.248 --> 01:57:04.417
OPTION NOW THE ARE IN THE BILL

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:05.985
RIGHT NOW LIKE YOU [INAUDIBLE]

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:09.188
FOR ANNOUNCES SAYS -- THERE'S NO

01:57:09.255 --> 01:57:10.757
MINIMUM FREQUENCY REQUIREMENTS

01:57:10.823 --> 01:57:11.924
WELL ACTUALLY THIS THAT MEMONS

01:57:11.991 --> 01:57:13.826
THAT WE'VE TAKEN THERE'S FIVE

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.928
CRITERIA THAT THE STOP PASSED TO

01:57:15.995 --> 01:57:16.562
ME.

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:18.398
SO IT HAS TO BE FIFTEEN MINUTE

01:57:18.464 --> 01:57:20.500
HEADWAYS DURING PEAK TIMES IT

01:57:20.566 --> 01:57:22.034
HAS TO BE ALL DOOR BOARDING IT

01:57:22.101 --> 01:57:24.771
HAS TO BE SIGNAL PRIORITIZATION.

01:57:24.837 --> 01:57:26.005
IT NEEDS.

01:57:26.072 --> 01:57:27.340
TO THERE'S ONE THAT I THINK IS

01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:28.608
ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY PROBLEMATIC

01:57:28.674 --> 01:57:31.277
BUT IT HAS TO ALLOW FOR A

01:57:31.344 --> 01:57:33.913
LOADING OF YOUR FARE BEFORE AT

01:57:33.980 --> 01:57:35.481
THE STATION.

01:57:35.548 --> 01:57:36.082
THE ONLY REASON I THINK IT'S

01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.849
PROBLEMATIC AS WITH THE

01:57:36.916 --> 01:57:38.217
TECHNOLOGY CHANGING TO WHERE

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:39.419
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOUR PHONE

01:57:39.485 --> 01:57:41.020
WILL DO IT THROUGH AN APP WHICH

01:57:41.087 --> 01:57:41.854
BE AT THE STATION.

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:43.222
SO I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED AS TO

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:43.856
THAT WERE SORT OF LIMITED

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:45.158
TECHNOLOGY BUT I UNDERSTAND THE

01:57:45.224 --> 01:57:46.759
GOAL AND THERE WAS ONE OTHER

01:57:46.826 --> 01:57:50.563
CRITERIA WHICH OF THE TOP OF MY

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:52.331
HEAD -- YEAH YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:52.899
BUS SHELTER SO IT'S PRETTY

01:57:52.965 --> 01:57:53.733
STRICT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE

01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:55.735
CRITERIA ARE FOR THE STATIONS

01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:56.936
AND IF THERE'S A STATION THAT

01:57:57.003 --> 01:57:58.137
FOR SOME REASON MAYBE.

01:57:58.204 --> 01:57:59.439
MAYBE THEY SKIP IT IS LIKE I'M

01:57:59.505 --> 01:58:01.307
NOT EXPRESSED OP OR SOMETHING

01:58:01.374 --> 01:58:02.608
LIKE THE WAY THEY DO IN SOME

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:04.076
PRICING SOME STATIONS THAT ONE

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:05.211
MY COURT NOT.

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.546
BY BUT THE OTHER STATIONS WELL

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:08.748
DOES NOT A MENU IF THAT'S IF

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:10.183
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:10.850
YOU I DON'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE I

01:58:10.917 --> 01:58:11.751
THINK THIS GROUP HERE VERY

01:58:11.818 --> 01:58:13.753
HELPFUL BECAUSE I ALSO ON ON THE

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.054
VENTURA COUNTY CITED THE

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:15.955
DISTRICT.

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:17.423
THERE'S THERE ARE SOME

01:58:17.490 --> 01:58:19.659
INTERSPERSED TRANSIT OPTIONS BUT

01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.894
THERE ARE VERY FEW AND FAR

01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.262
BETWEEN AND I WOULDN'T CALL THEM.

01:58:23.329 --> 01:58:24.597
AT A MAJOR TREND I STOPPED THAT

01:58:24.664 --> 01:58:28.267
WERE THING ABOUT HERE SO YES

01:58:28.334 --> 01:58:29.402
ORANGE LINE.

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.938
YOU KNOW THERE'S A TODAY BY SAID

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:32.772
A SENIOR VALLEY THAT'LL HOKEY

AND YOU KNOW TO THE OXNARD LIKE.

01:58:35.007 --> 01:58:36.075
THAT ACT SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:36.976
REFINED I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:58:37.043 --> 01:58:38.344
HELPFUL JUST TO BE CLEAR THIS IS

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:40.580
AN IS IN AND HAPPY TO MOVE THE

01:58:40.646 --> 01:58:42.815
BILL I HEARD I HEARD FROM MY

01:58:42.882 --> 01:58:43.783
COLLEAGUES IT'S ALREADY BEEN.

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.785
SO.

01:58:45.852 --> 01:58:47.386
THIS DEFERRED CHAIR THANK YOU

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:47.687
[INAUDIBLE]

01:58:47.753 --> 01:58:49.789
I GUESS.

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:50.890
WHEN I FIRST READ IT DOES SEEM

01:58:50.957 --> 01:58:52.458
LIKE AN INNOCUOUS BILL IT WASN'T

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:54.560
A BIG DEAL BUT I'M CONCERNED

01:58:54.627 --> 01:58:56.562
THAT NO TRANSPORTATION GROUPS OR

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:58.631
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE COME

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:00.166
FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE IDEA?

01:59:00.233 --> 01:59:02.602
I WONDER WHY IS THAT SO.

01:59:02.668 --> 01:59:04.637
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA.

01:59:04.704 --> 01:59:06.105
I BUSINESS PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE

01:59:06.172 --> 01:59:07.373
THE EXEMPTION BUT I DON'T SEE

01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:08.808
ANY OF THAT NORMAL

01:59:08.875 --> 01:59:10.776
TRANSPORTATION VIRAL GROUP SAID

01:59:10.843 --> 01:59:12.245
I WOULD EXPECT.

01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:14.013
TO COME FORWARD AFTER THEY DID

01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:15.681
THE ANALYSIS.

01:59:15.748 --> 01:59:17.783
YEAH THE POINT I WISH THAT THEY

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:21.254
WOULD.

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:23.322
IS YOUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

01:59:23.389 --> 01:59:25.124
NEXT IS THAT WE CAN MARY

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:28.027
CLEARASIL THE WHOLE POINT OF

01:59:28.094 --> 01:59:28.528
DOING TRANSIT ORIENTED

01:59:28.594 --> 01:59:29.695
DEVELOPMENT.

01:59:29.762 --> 01:59:31.964
IS SO THAT YOU HAVE COULD YOU

01:59:32.031 --> 01:59:33.366
CREATE CITIES ARE MORE.

01:59:33.432 --> 01:59:36.235
ACCESSIBLE BY MASS TRANSIT SO

01:59:36.302 --> 01:59:37.570
YOU REDUCE SPRAWL YOU ENCOURAGE

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:39.005
DEVELOPMENT AROUND YOUR MAJOR

01:59:39.071 --> 01:59:40.673
TRANSIT STOPS SO.

01:59:40.740 --> 01:59:42.208
WITHOUT THE LAND USE PIECE WE'RE

01:59:42.275 --> 01:59:43.409
NEVER GOING TO HIT OUR MISSION

01:59:43.476 --> 01:59:44.810
SCHOOLS WERE NEVER GONNA STOP

01:59:44.877 --> 01:59:46.979
SPRAWL AND THE WHOLE IDEA OF

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:48.614
WITH THIS MEASURE IS TO

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:49.549
ENCOURAGE.

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:50.783
WHEN IF YOU'RE GOING TO DEVELOP

01:59:50.850 --> 01:59:52.184
THE PLACE YOU'RE GOOD YOU SHOULD

01:59:52.251 --> 01:59:53.185
BE DEVELOPING IS NEAR?

01:59:53.252 --> 01:59:54.687
I'VE MASS TRANSIT WHERE IT'S

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:56.155
AVAILABLE PEOPLE WE'VE MADE

01:59:56.222 --> 01:59:57.957
THOSE MAJOR INVESTMENTS.

01:59:58.024 --> 02:00:03.262
AND SO -- THAT THERE IS THAT

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:04.697
CONNECTION.

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:05.565
I I MAYBE I MISSED IT BUT I

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:06.532
DIDN'T SEE THAT THERE'S

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:08.334
ASSURANCES THAT IT'S TIED.

02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:10.303
TO A SMART GROWTH DEVELOPMENT OR

02:00:10.369 --> 02:00:13.039
IT ALLOWS FOR THE TYPE OF

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:14.974
STREAMLINING THAT YOU WOULD GET.

02:00:15.041 --> 02:00:15.808
WHAT'S CONSIDERED HIGH PRIORITY

02:00:15.875 --> 02:00:17.243
TRANSIT.

02:00:17.310 --> 02:00:21.447
SO FOR PURPOSES OF ANY OTHER.

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:22.582
DENSITY BONUSES THAT SORT OF

02:00:22.648 --> 02:00:23.983
THING MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:31.624
THIS WOULD ALLOW THAT CONNECTION.

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.359
I MEAN FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.

02:00:33.426 --> 02:00:34.760
I'M OPEN TO HELPING.

02:00:34.827 --> 02:00:36.028
IF IT IF WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR

02:00:36.095 --> 02:00:37.563
NEXUS TO GREENHOUSE GAS

02:00:37.630 --> 02:00:38.731
REDUCTION OR INTEGRATION WITH

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:40.800
THIS BE THREE SEVENTY FIVE

02:00:40.866 --> 02:00:42.702
PLANNING OR TO THE YOU KNOW SORT

02:00:42.768 --> 02:00:43.569
OF BROADER.

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:45.871
DMT REDUCTION TARGETS IN THE

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:47.139
REGION THAT THROUGH SKAGGS MAYBE

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.308
THERE'S SOME KIND OF CROSS

02:00:49.375 --> 02:00:50.977
REFERENCE THAT WOULD BOLSTER.

02:00:51.043 --> 02:00:52.578
WE CAN ACTIVITY THE CONNECTIVITY

02:00:52.645 --> 02:00:53.746
YEAH I MEAN IT'S IT REALLY IS

02:00:53.813 --> 02:00:54.814
THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL THE

02:00:54.880 --> 02:00:56.515
PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO FREE

02:00:56.582 --> 02:00:58.417
UP THESE. TO CALL THIS MAJOR

02:00:58.484 --> 02:00:59.218
TRANSIT.

02:00:59.285 --> 02:01:00.686
THERE'S A HIGH PRIORITY TRANSIT

02:01:00.753 --> 02:01:03.623
DOES ENJOY SOME BENEFITS BY.

02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:04.557
YOU KNOW SORT OF BY THE

02:01:04.624 --> 02:01:06.158
LEGISLATURE BY LOCALITIES AND

02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:08.260
CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR INSTANCE

02:01:08.327 --> 02:01:08.894
AND THIS WOULD ALLOW THE ORANGE

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:10.663
LINE AND I FAR AS I KNOW ONLY

02:01:10.730 --> 02:01:11.931
THE ORANGE LINE AT THIS POINT.

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:13.099
TO QUALIFY BECAUSE IT IS SO

02:01:13.165 --> 02:01:15.801
NARROWLY DEFINED SO IT WOULDN'T

02:01:15.868 --> 02:01:16.936
BE DOESN'T I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:01:17.003 --> 02:01:19.038
THERE'S ANY OTHER OR MANY OTHER

02:01:19.105 --> 02:01:20.740
BUS RAPID TRANSIT THAT QUALIFY

02:01:20.806 --> 02:01:21.941
AT THIS POINT.

02:01:22.008 --> 02:01:23.476
BUT THIS MIGHT SPUR YOU KNOW

02:01:23.542 --> 02:01:25.311
MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT HAVING

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.580
THEM IN AREAS WHERE WE FEEL.

02:01:27.647 --> 02:01:31.817
THEY CAN BE OF BENEFIT IT'S IT'S

02:01:31.884 --> 02:01:32.685
IT'S IT'S EXTENDING.

02:01:32.752 --> 02:01:34.353
THE INVESTMENT OF THE MASS

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:37.390
TRANSIT TO NOW ALSO ENJOY THE

02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:39.859
OTHER AND BENEFITS THAT HIGH

02:01:39.925 --> 02:01:42.862
QUALITY TRANSIT OFFERS NEAR NEAR

02:01:42.928 --> 02:01:44.296
HER RAIL STATIONS MAYBE THE

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:45.831
RIGHT VENUE THEN IS MAKING SURE

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:48.868
THE THE PLANNING PROCESS RUN

02:01:48.934 --> 02:01:50.036
ORANGE LINE EXPANSION AND

02:01:50.102 --> 02:01:52.204
DEVELOPMENT IS CLEARLY.

02:01:52.271 --> 02:01:53.906
REDUCING EMISSIONS WHICH IS THE

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:55.708
WHOLE POINT OF YOU KNOW GETTING

02:01:55.775 --> 02:01:57.743
MEASURE M. ARE AND EVERYTHING

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:59.178
OUT THERE.

02:01:59.245 --> 02:02:00.846
TO GET THE VALLEY.

02:02:00.913 --> 02:02:02.648
I'D LIKE TO SEE IT ON TRACK

02:02:02.715 --> 02:02:02.948
[INAUDIBLE]

02:02:03.015 --> 02:02:03.416
EVENTUALLY [INAUDIBLE]

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:06.952
BUT YES MAYBE MAYBE THAT'S

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:08.387
SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON AS THE

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.989
BILL IF THE BILL MOVES FOR JUST

02:02:10.056 --> 02:02:11.724
TO ARTICULATE IN A FINDING OR

02:02:11.791 --> 02:02:13.292
SOME NEXUS THERE THEY CAN MAKE

02:02:13.359 --> 02:02:13.726
IT CLEAR [INAUDIBLE]

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:18.164
OPEN THAT.

02:02:18.230 --> 02:02:18.964
YEAH I'M.

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:21.333
THIS IS GOING TO HOUSING I WOULD

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.035
LIKE I'M GONNA STAY OFF AND I I

02:02:23.102 --> 02:02:24.203
WANT TO HELP THE BILL TO MOVE

02:02:24.270 --> 02:02:25.738
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE.

02:02:25.805 --> 02:02:28.140
I CROSS ALL T. ISN'T THAT THE

02:02:28.207 --> 02:02:29.542
ICE ON THIS ONE SO NOT.

02:02:29.608 --> 02:02:30.109
I WANT TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:30.409
[INAUDIBLE]

02:02:30.476 --> 02:02:34.346
OKAY.

02:02:34.413 --> 02:02:35.548
I DO FOR YOU.

02:02:35.614 --> 02:02:36.982
ACCEPTING.

02:02:37.049 --> 02:02:40.419
DEMANDS IN WORKING WITH US AND

02:02:40.486 --> 02:02:41.754
YOU KNOW I I I I THINK WE JUST

02:02:41.821 --> 02:02:43.155
DIDN'T WANT TO GET WHERE SHE WAS

02:02:43.222 --> 02:02:44.356
TRYING TO DO I'M.

02:02:44.423 --> 02:02:46.392
I THINK AT THE SAME TIME.

02:02:46.459 --> 02:02:46.992
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:02:47.059 --> 02:02:48.627
THAT WE DIDN'T.

02:02:48.694 --> 02:02:50.596
GO SO FAR BEYOND.

02:02:50.663 --> 02:02:53.499
WHAT WE COMMONLY KNOWN TO BE A

02:02:53.566 --> 02:02:54.400
BUS RAPID TRANSIT STATION

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:54.700
[INAUDIBLE]

02:02:54.767 --> 02:02:58.104
AND TO TO PUT THAT IN THERE WAS

02:02:58.170 --> 02:02:59.839
A RISK HERE THAT THAT WE WOULD

02:02:59.905 --> 02:03:01.941
GET TO THAT WE WOULD START TO

OPPOSITION -- THIS IS A VERY

02:13:29.368 --> 02:13:30.535
NARROW COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:31.269
TALKING ABOUT THAT'S BEING

02:13:31.336 --> 02:13:32.304
CARVED OUT OF THIS BILL WE'RE

02:13:32.371 --> 02:13:34.172
SIMPLY SAYING THAT IF A

02:13:34.239 --> 02:13:35.807
HOMEOWNER WERE TO TAKE.

02:13:35.874 --> 02:13:38.310

02:13:38.377 --> 02:13:39.044
DOLLARS FROM THIS FUN.

02:13:39.111 --> 02:13:40.112
THEY COULD BE SUED FOR THAT

02:13:40.178 --> 02:13:42.681
AMOUNT -- WE ADDED LANGUAGE AS

02:13:42.748 --> 02:13:44.116
WE DISCUSSED AND SENATE

02:13:44.182 --> 02:13:46.351
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. TO MAKE IT

02:13:46.418 --> 02:13:47.786
VERY CLEAR THAT THIS LAW WILL

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:49.054
NOT ALTER ANY EXISTING

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:50.555
OBLIGATIONS ON HOMEOWNERS TO

02:13:50.622 --> 02:13:51.590
MAINTAIN THEIR PROPERTY UNDER

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:53.058
APPLICABLE LAW OR OTHERWISE

02:13:53.125 --> 02:13:55.293
LIMIT ATTENDANCE LEGAL REMEDIES

02:13:55.360 --> 02:13:56.495

LEAD PAINT ON A TWILIGHT SO.

02:13:57.696 --> 02:14:00.165
WE MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT AGAIN

02:14:00.232 --> 02:14:01.400
THE SLUMLORDS AS ENGAGE ABOUT

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:02.834
ACTIVITY ANYONE CAN GO AFTER

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:03.368
THEM.

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:05.704
EXCEPT WHERE IT'S RELATED TO

02:14:05.771 --> 02:14:07.606
SIMPLY TAKING DISSIPATING IN

02:14:07.672 --> 02:14:08.440
THIS PROGRAM.

02:14:08.507 --> 02:14:09.374
AND I WILL TELL YOU THERE

02:14:09.441 --> 02:14:10.842
THERE'S A REASON WHY THAT THE

02:14:10.909 --> 02:14:12.477
TENANT ORGANIZATIONS AND WESTERN

02:14:12.544 --> 02:14:14.179
CENTER OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS

02:14:14.246 --> 02:14:15.714
WELL AS ALL OF THE CITIES.

02:14:15.781 --> 02:14:17.249
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:18.884
ENFORCING LAWS AGAINST LANDLORDS

02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:19.985
ARE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE I

02:14:20.051 --> 02:14:21.386
KNOW HOW NEAR IT IS BUT THEY

02:14:21.453 --> 02:14:22.788
ALSO KNOW THAT ONCE YOU OPEN UP

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:25.056
THE DOOR. TO SAY THAT THE PAINT

02:14:25.123 --> 02:14:26.458
COMPANIES COULD POTENTIALLY

02:14:26.525 --> 02:14:29.194
BRING EVEN ONE LAWSUIT AGAINST

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:30.662
ONE LANDLORD YOU DETER

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:31.963
PARTICIPATION THIS PROGRAM WHAT

02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:33.331
THE THE PAIN COMPANIES ARE

02:14:33.398 --> 02:14:33.932
TRYING TO DO.

02:14:33.999 --> 02:14:35.801
IS TO SLOW DOWN THE RATE AT

02:14:35.867 --> 02:14:37.002
WHICH THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:38.437
DOLLARS COULD BE USED OVER FOUR

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:39.271
YEAR PERIOD.

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:40.205
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ALL THAT

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:41.673
MONEY GETS OUT IN GEORGIA

02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:43.308
RESTRICTIONS TO KEEP OUR

02:14:43.375 --> 02:14:44.709
COMMUNITY SAFE AND I JUST WANT

02:14:44.776 --> 02:14:47.112
TO ASK IF THE CITY ATTORNEY.

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:47.846
FROM OUR SEE IF YOU HAVE

02:14:47.913 --> 02:14:51.950
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT.

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:52.751
YEAH I WOULD ADD.

02:14:52.818 --> 02:14:54.486
I WOULD ADD THAT. TO THE EXTENT

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:55.086
THAT THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES

02:14:55.153 --> 02:14:55.921
WANT TO THREATEN TO SUE ANYONE

02:14:55.987 --> 02:14:57.189
THOSE LAWSUITS WOULD BE

02:14:57.255 --> 02:14:59.891
FRIVOLOUS AND WITHOUT ANY BASIS

02:14:59.958 --> 02:15:00.559
IN LAW.

02:15:00.625 --> 02:15:03.094
THE COURT OF APPEAL ALREADY HELD

02:15:03.161 --> 02:15:05.430
IN THIS CASE THE EAD PAINT

02:15:05.497 --> 02:15:07.499
COMPANIES WERE LIABLE FOR THEIR

02:15:07.566 --> 02:15:09.634

PARTICIPATED IN THAT BEHAVIOR

02:15:20.445 --> 02:15:22.113
AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE COURT OF

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:24.883
APPEAL ALREADY HELD IN THIS CASE.

02:15:24.950 --> 02:15:27.519
THAT NO HOME OWNER IS A JOINT

PORT FEES ARE AND THEREFORE

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:31.490

BILL.

03:33:54.721 --> 03:33:56.490
FIRST IS THE PUBLIC POLICY

03:33:56.557 --> 03:33:57.824
INTERESTS OF KEEPING RAT POISON

03:33:57.891 --> 03:33:58.492
AND OTHER POISONS OF THE

C. O. C. SHARES AND HAS

03:34:02.396 --> 03:34:03.297
CONSISTENTLY STATED.

03:34:03.363 --> 03:34:04.631
TO THE AUTHOR MISTER BLOOM IN

03:34:04.698 --> 03:34:05.399
THE MULTIPLE YEARS THAT WE'VE

03:34:05.465 --> 03:34:06.700
HAD A DIALOGUE ON THIS ISSUE

03:34:06.767 --> 03:34:08.135
GOING ON WITH HIM.

03:34:08.202 --> 03:34:10.137
THE SECOND POLICY ISSUE IS THE

03:34:10.204 --> 03:34:11.605
CONTROL OF COMMENSAL RODENTS

03:34:11.672 --> 03:34:13.507
STATED CALIFORNIA WHICH WE WOULD

03:34:13.574 --> 03:34:15.075
ARGUES A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

03:34:15.142 --> 03:34:15.943
WELL.

03:34:16.009 --> 03:34:17.444
WITH A VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE

03:34:17.511 --> 03:34:18.545
SHOULD THAT NOT BE TREATED IN

03:34:18.612 --> 03:34:20.581
THE RIGHT MANNER IN THAT WE'VE

03:34:20.647 --> 03:34:23.050
ALREADY SEEN IN LOS ANGELES RAT

03:34:23.116 --> 03:34:24.084
OPERATIONS YOU EXPLODE.

03:34:24.151 --> 03:34:25.419
WHICH ISN'T GONNA GET BETTER

03:34:25.485 --> 03:34:27.521
WITH OF GLOBAL WARMING AND

03:34:27.588 --> 03:34:28.855
ELSE'S LEADS TO COOK

03:34:28.922 --> 03:34:30.490
COMMENSURATE DISEASES SUCH AS

03:34:30.557 --> 03:34:32.292
TYPHUS AND AND PLAGUE AND THINGS

03:34:32.359 --> 03:34:33.060
OF THAT NATURE.

03:34:33.126 --> 03:34:34.261
THE THIRD PUBLIC INTEREST IS THE

03:34:34.328 --> 03:34:36.597
INTEREST OF THE REGULATORY

03:34:36.663 --> 03:34:39.466
APPARATUS THAT EXISTS ALREADY TO

03:34:39.533 --> 03:34:41.435
ADDRESS THESE MATTERS AND THE

03:34:41.501 --> 03:34:42.936
PAST CONTROL OFFERS A CALIFORNIA

03:34:43.003 --> 03:34:44.304
HAVE BEEN REGULATED SINCE LATE

03:34:44.371 --> 03:34:46.206
THIRTIES THEY HAVE INVITED

03:34:46.273 --> 03:34:47.908
REGULATION IN THE PAST ARE NOT

03:34:47.975 --> 03:34:49.142
AFRAID OF REGULATION.

03:34:49.209 --> 03:34:50.477
AND THEY'VE NOT RUN FROM THIS

03:34:50.544 --> 03:34:52.145
ISSUE AND DENIED ITS EXISTENCE

03:34:52.212 --> 03:34:53.981
IN ACT WE HAVE HAD AN ONGOING

03:34:54.047 --> 03:34:55.082
DIALOGUE WITH MR BLOOM.

03:34:55.148 --> 03:34:56.883
OVER MANY YEARS OVER THIS ISSUE

03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:58.986
AND HAVE TRIED TO FIND SOME.

03:34:59.052 --> 03:35:06.660
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION -- TO

03:35:06.727 --> 03:35:08.595
THIS AND WE STILL THINK WE CAN.

03:35:08.662 --> 03:35:09.196
I WILL SAY THAT -- WHAT YOU

03:35:09.263 --> 03:35:10.931
HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS OF THE

03:35:10.998 --> 03:35:13.233
BILL IS YOU KNOW?

03:35:13.300 --> 03:35:14.668
SOME OF IT IS QUITE VERY TRUE IN

03:35:14.735 --> 03:35:16.103
MAINE YES IF YOU ARE FINDING RAT

03:35:16.169 --> 03:35:17.170
POISON IN -- PLACES THAT IT

03:35:17.237 --> 03:35:17.971
SHOULDN'T BE BUT YOU WOULD ALSO

03:35:18.038 --> 03:35:18.972
KEEP IN MIND THAT THERE IS ALSO

03:35:19.039 --> 03:35:20.974
A TALE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

03:35:21.041 --> 03:35:23.610
PRIVATE USE AND NON COMMERCIAL

03:35:23.677 --> 03:35:25.412
BUT THE RESIDENTIAL USE OF RAT

03:35:25.479 --> 03:35:26.013
POISON.

03:35:26.079 --> 03:35:27.381
THESE MATERIALS ARE ALSO

03:35:27.447 --> 03:35:28.849
AVAILABLE OVER THE INTERNET FOR

03:35:28.915 --> 03:35:30.183
SALE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND

03:35:30.250 --> 03:35:31.318
EASILY OBTAINED.

03:35:31.385 --> 03:35:34.621
SO THERE'S AN ILLEGAL -- CHANNEL

03:35:34.688 --> 03:35:36.657
OF MARKETING AND COMMERCE INTO

03:35:36.723 --> 03:35:39.126
THE STATE THAT DEFIES THE LINE

03:35:39.192 --> 03:35:40.594
THAT I THINK CONTRIBUTES A LOT

03:35:40.661 --> 03:35:42.262
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT SPOTTED

03:35:42.329 --> 03:35:44.364
DOWN PARTICULAR WE LOOK TO THE

03:35:44.431 --> 03:35:45.599
CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN NORTHERN

03:35:45.666 --> 03:35:47.334
CALIFORNIA.

03:35:47.401 --> 03:35:49.336
WHICH IS THE TAURUS -- FOR THEIR

03:35:49.403 --> 03:35:53.507
USE OF MATERIALS THAT MIGHT NOT

03:35:53.573 --> 03:35:56.209
BE ON LABEL AND SO.

03:35:56.276 --> 03:35:57.377
WE FEEL THAT THERE IS AN

03:35:57.444 --> 03:35:59.680
APPROPRIATE PLACE.

03:35:59.746 --> 03:36:03.283
THESE MATERIALS AND A CONTROL

03:36:03.350 --> 03:36:05.585
STRATEGY THAT DOESN'T JUST LEAN

03:36:05.652 --> 03:36:07.854
ON ONLY RAT POISON LEANS ON

03:36:07.921 --> 03:36:10.590
SANITATION MEANS ON EXCLUSION

03:36:10.657 --> 03:36:13.293
AND LEANS ON FERTILITY CONTROL

03:36:13.360 --> 03:36:16.363
AS MENTIONED BY THE WOMAN TO MY

03:36:16.430 --> 03:36:16.697
DOCTOR.

03:36:16.763 --> 03:36:19.032
MY LEFT ARM AND I WOULD EVEN SAY

03:36:19.099 --> 03:36:20.567
THAT I TOOK A QUICK LOOK AT HER

03:36:20.634 --> 03:36:22.302
THE WEBSITE FOR HER COMPANY.

03:36:22.369 --> 03:36:24.204
AND THEY HAVE A AID SORT OF

03:36:24.271 --> 03:36:26.873
HIERARCHY OF OF CONTROL

03:36:26.940 --> 03:36:27.908
STRATEGIES AS PART OF AN

03:36:27.974 --> 03:36:30.777
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

03:36:30.844 --> 03:36:32.813
STRATEGY THAT ALSO INCLUDES.

03:36:32.879 --> 03:36:34.548
RAT POISON RECRUITS CHEMICAL SO

03:36:34.614 --> 03:36:36.383
THEY DON'T LEAN SOLELY ON

03:36:36.450 --> 03:36:38.785
FERTILITY CONTROL IT IS PART OF

03:36:38.852 --> 03:36:40.387
A SUITE OF DIFFERENT TOOLS

03:36:40.454 --> 03:36:42.356
NECESSARY TO CONTROL RATS.

03:36:42.422 --> 03:36:44.958
AND WHAT MY CLIENTS ARE SAYING

03:36:45.025 --> 03:36:45.892
IS.

03:36:45.959 --> 03:36:47.361
SECOND GENERATION REGINA SIDES

03:36:47.427 --> 03:36:48.295
FOR AS LONG AS THEY ARE ROUTE

03:36:48.362 --> 03:36:50.263
INTO AND UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER

03:36:50.330 --> 03:36:51.164
ALTERNATIVE.

03:36:51.231 --> 03:36:52.599
IS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THAT

03:36:52.666 --> 03:36:54.568
SUITE OF TOOLS THAT WE WOULD NOT

03:36:54.634 --> 03:36:56.336
LIKE TO LOSE BECAUSE IS A

03:36:56.403 --> 03:36:58.205
SOPHISTICATED THING TO CONTROL

03:36:58.271 --> 03:37:00.307
RATS ESPECIALLY ON THE CAMPUSES

03:37:00.374 --> 03:37:01.274
LARGE AS YOU'D FIND IN SOME OF

03:37:01.341 --> 03:37:02.275
THE BIOTECH.

03:37:02.342 --> 03:37:04.711
OR ANY LARGE AREA IT DOESN'T

03:37:04.778 --> 03:37:06.246
INVOLVE A WE'RE JUST GONNA STICK

03:37:06.313 --> 03:37:06.747
BAIT BOXES OUT ALONG THE

03:37:06.813 --> 03:37:08.982
BUILDING IT INVOLVES IDENTIFYING.

03:37:09.049 --> 03:37:11.351
THE PRESENCE THE POPULATION THE

03:37:11.418 --> 03:37:13.420
LOCATION OF THE BOROUGHS EITHER

03:37:13.487 --> 03:37:15.288
LURING THOSE RATS AWAY FROM THE

03:37:15.355 --> 03:37:16.223
BURROUGHS AND AWAY FROM THE

03:37:16.289 --> 03:37:17.624
BUILDINGS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED

03:37:17.691 --> 03:37:19.292
OR IF THEY'RE NEAR THE BUILDINGS

03:37:19.359 --> 03:37:19.993
ARE IN THE BUILDINGS.

03:37:20.060 --> 03:37:21.128
LORING ABOUT IN GETTING THEM OUT

03:37:21.194 --> 03:37:25.499
INTO THE OPEN SPACE WHERE THEY

03:37:25.565 --> 03:37:26.666
CAN BE MORE.

03:37:26.733 --> 03:37:28.301
APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED IT'S NOT

03:37:28.368 --> 03:37:30.570
A HAPHAZARD I'M GONNA THROW A

03:37:30.637 --> 03:37:31.838
BIG BOX DOWN AND OR AT LEAST IT

03:37:31.905 --> 03:37:32.906
SHOULDN'T BE INTENSELY IT'S NOT

03:37:32.973 --> 03:37:37.377
WITH.

03:37:37.444 --> 03:37:39.513
HOPE THAT POISON TAKES EFFECT

03:37:39.579 --> 03:37:40.847
AND YOU KNOW THE RATS STOCK SO

03:37:40.914 --> 03:37:43.183
THERE'S A LOT OF THOUGHT THAT

03:37:43.250 --> 03:37:44.584
GOES INTO IRAQ IN COMMENSAL

03:37:44.651 --> 03:37:46.887
RODENT CONTROL THERE'S A LOT OF

03:37:46.953 --> 03:37:48.688
A AYE AYES SOPHISTICATION

03:37:48.755 --> 03:37:49.322
BELIEVE IT OR NOT.

03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:50.891
IT'S REQUIRED BECAUSE YES

03:37:50.957 --> 03:37:52.793
RESISTANCE IS AN ISSUE BUT

03:37:52.859 --> 03:37:53.727
YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH A

03:37:53.794 --> 03:37:55.862
HIGHLY INTELLIGENT ANIMAL THAT

03:37:55.929 --> 03:37:56.630
IF YOU SEIZE.

03:37:56.696 --> 03:37:58.498
IT'S A BROTHER SISTER WALK INTO

03:37:58.565 --> 03:38:00.500
A BOX AND NOT COME OUT BECAUSE

03:38:00.567 --> 03:38:03.437
IS DEAD WELL ANGLE ON THE BOX OR

03:38:03.503 --> 03:38:04.204
IF IT'S BROTHER SISTER WALKS

03:38:04.271 --> 03:38:05.739
INTO THAT BOX AND GOES BACK TO

03:38:05.806 --> 03:38:06.606
THE BERLIN DIES.

03:38:06.673 --> 03:38:08.341
THEY'RE GONNA LIKE SENSITIZED --

03:38:08.408 --> 03:38:09.109
TO WE SHOULDN'T GO INTO THOSE

03:38:09.176 --> 03:38:12.446
BOXES SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE.

03:38:12.512 --> 03:38:14.347
SMARTER THAN A RAT WHICH IS

03:38:14.414 --> 03:38:16.516
PROBABLY WHY I'M NOT A OF PEST

03:38:16.583 --> 03:38:18.084
CONTROL OPERATOR -- SO I MEAN

03:38:18.151 --> 03:38:20.754
IT'S JUST YOU JUST IT'S IT'S NOT

03:38:20.821 --> 03:38:22.823
IS SIMPLE AS LET'S GET RID OF

03:38:22.889 --> 03:38:24.858
THIS MATERIAL AND WILL FIND

03:38:24.925 --> 03:38:26.259
REPLACEMENTS FOR THE RATS.

03:38:26.326 --> 03:38:28.462
THERE WILL BE SOME DAY SOMETHING

03:38:28.528 --> 03:38:29.930
THAT WE MOVE BEYOND THEN THE S.

03:38:29.996 --> 03:38:32.499
CARS BUT WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS

03:38:32.566 --> 03:38:34.501
FOR THE TIME BEING LET US HAVE

03:38:34.568 --> 03:38:36.636
AN EMERGENCY USE PROVISION.

03:38:36.703 --> 03:38:39.039
NOT THE ONE IN THIS BILL BECAUSE

03:38:39.105 --> 03:38:40.674
THAT DOESN'T HE OF THE RIVER

03:38:40.740 --> 03:38:42.309

REASON IS.

03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:11.031

THESE INSPECTIONS ARE RANDOM --

03:41:18.665 --> 03:41:19.699
AND IN MOST CASES PARTICULARLY

03:41:19.766 --> 03:41:21.301
FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF VERY

03:41:21.368 --> 03:41:23.403
DELICATE -- MEDICINES THAT ARE

03:41:37.217 --> 03:41:38.885
FOR THE FDA TO SHUT US DOWN.

03:41:38.952 --> 03:41:40.420
SHUTTING DOWN OF THE SILLY LIKE

AND MANUFACTURE MEDICINES AND SO

03:41:47.494 --> 03:41:49.229
WE'RE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED NOT

03:41:49.295 --> 03:41:50.563
BECAUSE WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR

03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:53.800
THE USE OF SGA OURS -- BUT ONLY

03:41:53.867 --> 03:41:55.502
BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO BE

03:41:55.568 --> 03:41:57.237
EXEMPTED SO THAT IN SITUATIONS

03:41:57.303 --> 03:41:59.039
WHERE THE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS

03:41:59.105 --> 03:42:00.774
IS CALLED FOR AND DOM TOUCHED ON

03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:02.676
IT AND I THINK WE'VE.

03:42:02.742 --> 03:42:04.277
HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT.

03:42:04.344 --> 03:42:05.912
CONTROLLING ROAD POPULATIONS IS

03:42:05.979 --> 03:42:08.448
NOT EASY WE USE MULTIPLE TYPES

03:42:08.515 --> 03:42:11.384
MULTIPLE.

03:42:11.451 --> 03:42:13.319

03:42:13.987 --> 03:42:15.622
AND AGAIN TAKING AWAY HALF OF

03:42:15.689 --> 03:42:16.589
THOSE TOOLS BE VERY POP

03:42:16.656 --> 03:42:17.323
PROBLEMATIC FOR OUR MEMBER

03:42:17.390 --> 03:42:21.294

03:42:40.313 --> 03:42:42.082

ECONOMIC VALUE BUT THERE'S GOT

03:47:44.884 --> 03:47:47.253
TO BE A MORE REFINED APPROACH --

03:47:47.320 --> 03:47:48.821
I KNOW YOU GUYS BEEN WORKING

03:47:48.888 --> 03:47:50.590

AND IF WE KEEP KICKING THE CAN

03:48:09.976 --> 03:48:10.943
DOWN THE ROAD.

03:48:11.010 --> 03:48:13.613
THAT WE ARE GOING TO EXTINCT.

03:48:13.679 --> 03:48:16.616
OUR CRITICAL POPULATIONS.

03:48:16.682 --> 03:48:19.152
OF COOPER HAWKES START THERE BUT

03:48:19.218 --> 03:48:20.720
WORK YOUR WAY DOWN.

03:48:20.787 --> 03:48:22.321
IF WE EXPECT NOT LINES ON OUR

03:48:22.388 --> 03:48:23.523
WATCH.

03:48:23.589 --> 03:48:25.858
SHAME ON US SO MOVE THE BILL AT

03:48:25.925 --> 03:48:28.828

MAYBE I'LL SWALLOW THAT PILL I

03:48:34.033 --> 03:48:34.534
CAME IN LATE BECAUSE OF THE

03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:36.402
BUDGET SO I'M NOT IT'S NOT CLEAR

03:48:36.469 --> 03:48:38.871
MY MIND WHERE THE AUTHOR IS ON

03:48:38.938 --> 03:48:39.072
THIS.

03:48:39.138 --> 03:48:40.907
BIOTECH.

03:48:40.973 --> 03:48:43.476
OUR CONCERN IS HER NO LANGUAGE

03:48:43.543 --> 03:48:45.945
THAT'S BEING AMENDED TODAY OR WE

03:48:46.012 --> 03:48:47.480
DO NOT HAVE LANGUAGE TODAY WERE

03:48:47.547 --> 03:48:49.449
IN DISCUSSIONS WITH WITH THE

03:48:49.515 --> 03:48:51.317
INDUSTRY AND WERE WILLING TO

03:48:51.384 --> 03:48:54.087
CONSIDER THAT -- THE THE CONCERN

03:48:54.153 --> 03:48:56.656
THAT THEY HAVE -- WE WANT AS

03:48:56.722 --> 03:49:00.526
NARROWLY -- CAFTED OF LANGUAGES

03:49:00.593 --> 03:49:03.496
AS POSSIBLE AND WE'RE JUST NOT

03:49:03.563 --> 03:49:04.730
THERE AT THIS POINT.

03:49:04.797 --> 03:49:05.631
IS WITH THE WORD WILL THIS BE

03:49:05.698 --> 03:49:07.667
SIMILAR TO THE EXEMPTION

03:49:07.733 --> 03:49:11.104
LANGUAGE FOR WINERIES AND

03:49:11.170 --> 03:49:13.239
BREWERIES THAT WE HAVE.

03:49:13.306 --> 03:49:14.941
I COULDN'T SAY.

03:49:15.007 --> 03:49:15.975
I MEAN I KNOW WE HAVE THOSE

03:49:16.042 --> 03:49:17.677
EXEMPTIONS THAT EXCESS SO I I

03:49:17.743 --> 03:49:18.878
JUST.

03:49:18.945 --> 03:49:20.279
YOU KNOW THIS IS A BIG DEAL MY

03:49:20.346 --> 03:49:21.547
DISTRICT SO I HAVE A LOT OF YOU

03:49:21.614 --> 03:49:23.149
KNOW.

03:49:23.216 --> 03:49:24.684
BY THE BY THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:26.052
SIDE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE

03:49:26.119 --> 03:49:31.023
BALANCE THAT WE ADDRESS ON IT --

03:49:31.090 --> 03:49:33.626
ALL RIGHT SO.

03:49:33.693 --> 03:49:34.460

WE'RE WE'RE INTENDING -- TO TO

03:49:36.963 --> 03:49:39.365
GET THERE BUT I THINK BIOTECH IS

03:49:39.432 --> 03:49:42.435
A LOT DIFFERENT FROM -- FROM THE

03:49:42.502 --> 03:49:43.369
WINERY INDUSTRY.

03:49:43.436 --> 03:49:44.704
AND SO WE WANT TO KEEP OUR

03:49:44.770 --> 03:49:47.707
LANGUAGE AS NARROWLY FOCUSED AS

03:49:47.773 --> 03:49:51.511
POSSIBLE.

03:49:51.577 --> 03:49:56.649
I SENSE SKINNER.

WHERE WE ARE?

03:50:09.829 --> 03:50:12.198
MAC IN THIS BILL WOULD GO NEXT

03:50:12.265 --> 03:50:14.100
TO APPROACH.

03:50:14.167 --> 03:50:16.202

03:50:16.269 --> 03:50:17.003
RESEARCH SO YOU WOULD HAVE THE%

03:50:17.069 --> 03:50:19.005
ABILITY TO CONTINUE THIS

03:50:19.071 --> 03:50:21.707
DISCUSSION AND POTENTIALLY AN

03:50:21.774 --> 03:50:22.241
AMENDMENT THERE.

03:50:22.308 --> 03:50:24.410
YES THAT'S CORRECT.

03:50:24.477 --> 03:50:25.945

HAVEN'T GIVEN UP ON REACHING.

03:50:31.317 --> 03:50:34.687
I TRYING TO REACH AN AGREEMENT

03:50:34.754 --> 03:50:36.856
TO THAT BUT THE FACT.

03:50:36.923 --> 03:50:39.292
THIS IS A BALL IT'S BEEN KNOWN

03:50:39.358 --> 03:50:43.763
AS A CENTER STERN -- I REFLECTED

03:50:43.829 --> 03:50:44.430
UPON.

03:50:44.497 --> 03:50:45.064
THIS IS SOMETHING HAS GONE BACK

WE HAVE MEANT.

03:50:48.100 --> 03:50:50.002
TO REACH THAT POINT -- BUT IT'S

03:50:50.069 --> 03:50:51.904
NOT FOR LACK OF EFFORT AS AN

03:50:51.971 --> 03:50:53.539
ENGAGED IN THAT.

03:50:53.606 --> 03:50:54.740
LIST -- AN HONEST DIALOGUE THERE

03:50:54.807 --> 03:50:56.108
ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL

03:50:56.175 --> 03:51:01.514
DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT -- FOR FOR A

03:51:01.581 --> 03:51:05.751
WHETHER OR NOT PUBLIC.

03:51:05.818 --> 03:51:07.820
HEALTH EXEMPTION.

03:51:07.887 --> 03:51:09.922
IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER HER THE

03:51:09.989 --> 03:51:11.591
OF CONCERNS OF THE INDUSTRY WAY

03:51:11.657 --> 03:51:12.425
MAINTAIN THAT IT IS.

03:51:12.491 --> 03:51:16.529
BUT TOM WERE HAPPY TO MAINTAIN.

AFTER WERE -- IF WE NEED TO

03:51:20.032 --> 03:51:21.534
INCLUDE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE WILL

03:51:21.601 --> 03:51:22.101
CERTAINLY TRY AND FIND THAT

03:51:22.168 --> 03:51:23.336
LANGUAGE.

03:51:23.402 --> 03:51:24.837
I'M I APPRECIATE THAT.

03:51:24.904 --> 03:51:26.939

SEE IF THERE WAS A SWEET SPOT

03:51:53.466 --> 03:51:59.238
THAT COULD BE LANDED ON WITH THE

03:51:59.305 --> 03:52:00.840
LIFE SCIENCES BY.

03:52:00.906 --> 03:52:04.644

THIS -- LIKE A NUMBER OF EITHER

THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH OPTION

04:01:30.108 --> 04:01:31.743
HERE THAT COULD BE RESERVE

04:01:31.810 --> 04:01:34.379
PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPT CORRECT --

04:01:34.446 --> 04:01:36.415
AND THERE'S ALSO AN AG THE --

04:01:36.481 --> 04:01:38.183
EXEMPTION -- THAT'S -- THAT'S

04:01:38.250 --> 04:01:39.218
BUILT INTO THE LANGUAGE IN

04:01:39.284 --> 04:01:41.486

STRONGLY WITH THE SENATOR'S

04:01:47.459 --> 04:01:49.561
POINT BECAUSE SAID MY DISTRICT

04:01:49.628 --> 04:01:51.296
HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY FIRE AS

04:01:51.363 --> 04:01:52.865
WELL -- MOST RECENTLY WITH

04:01:52.931 --> 04:01:54.333
THE WORLD'S A FIRE IN THE

04:01:54.399 --> 04:01:57.102
AREA OF BURNS FREQUENTLY BUT

04:01:57.169 --> 04:01:58.637
WERE AFFECTED BY BOTH PROBLEMS

04:01:58.704 --> 04:02:01.173
BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A STRONG

04:02:01.240 --> 04:02:03.909
URBAN INTERFACE TO A -- A

04:02:03.976 --> 04:02:05.644
WILDLIFE AREA THAT IS VERY

04:02:05.711 --> 04:02:07.880
DRAINED -- I THINK WE ALL READ

04:02:07.946 --> 04:02:10.249
STORIES ABOUT TO THE -- --

04:02:10.315 --> 04:02:13.051
WILDLIFE AND -- OUTLINES AND

04:02:13.118 --> 04:02:15.454
-- AND IN MY DISTRICT THAT ARE

04:02:15.520 --> 04:02:16.855
AFFECTED BY THIS SO THERE'S

04:02:16.922 --> 04:02:20.192
A VERY -- I THINK STRONG

04:02:20.259 --> 04:02:22.094
INCLINATION BY ME AND OTHERS TO

04:02:22.160 --> 04:02:23.729
EXPLORE BOTH OF THOSE PROBLEMS

04:02:23.795 --> 04:02:25.464
BUT I THINK THEY ARE DISTINCT

04:02:25.530 --> 04:02:26.665
PROBLEMS BUT YOU'RE CERTAINLY

04:02:26.732 --> 04:02:28.767
RIGHT TO UNDERSTANDING

04:02:28.834 --> 04:02:30.802
THE EXTENT TO WHICH FIRE

04:02:30.869 --> 04:02:32.404
IS AFFECTING WILDLIFE IN

04:02:32.471 --> 04:02:33.605
THE STATE IS SOMETHING

04:02:33.672 --> 04:02:42.014
THAT WE SHOULD MUCH BETTER

04:02:42.080 --> 04:02:43.482
THANK YOU COULD EVER KNEW WE'D

04:02:43.548 --> 04:02:44.683

WE HAVE OUR MIND STRETCH IN

04:02:47.552 --> 04:02:50.222
OUR HEART EIGHTEEN A I NEITHER

04:02:50.289 --> 04:02:52.124
EITHER SIDE BECAUSE -- WHEN

04:02:52.190 --> 04:02:53.625
I THINK MANY OF US SAW THAT

04:02:53.692 --> 04:02:56.194
JOB HE TWENTY TWO RIGHT PAGE

04:02:56.261 --> 04:02:59.064
ARTICLE ON WAS KILLED AND ALL

04:02:59.131 --> 04:03:00.799
OF THAT REALLY TAKES A TOLL

04:03:00.866 --> 04:03:02.834
ON I THINK OUR WHAT WE BELIEVE

04:03:02.901 --> 04:03:04.403
TO BE OUR MORAL RESPONSIBILITY

04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:05.837
BUT I THINK IN THIS PARTICULAR

04:03:05.904 --> 04:03:07.839
ISSUE WE HAVE ONE ON BOTH SIDES

04:03:07.906 --> 04:03:11.276

THEY THINK IT'S CRITICAL ARE

04:03:24.122 --> 04:03:25.223
THAT A BETTER BALANCE CAN BE

04:03:25.290 --> 04:03:26.959
ACHIEVED -- AND THAT WILL BE

04:03:27.025 --> 04:03:28.560
A DIFFICULT NO VOTE FOR ME IF

04:03:28.627 --> 04:03:30.429
I WERE TO TAKE THAT BECAUSE OF

04:03:30.495 --> 04:03:33.298
MY DE TURN IN AND CARE ABOUT

04:03:44.109 --> 04:03:45.744
THOSE ON OUT THERE IN THE WILD

04:03:45.811 --> 04:03:46.845
LANDS THAT ARE GOING TO THIS

04:03:46.912 --> 04:03:47.679
AND THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE

04:03:47.746 --> 04:03:48.780
OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO THAT

04:03:48.847 --> 04:03:50.916
AREA WHICH YOU KNOW WE DID WE

ALONG WITH ONE

04:04:40.732 --> 04:04:42.334
SO YOU'RE THE EXCEPTION THING

04:04:42.401 --> 04:04:43.301
IN A WERE ALL SCRAMBLING FOR

LIKE IT IN OUR FULL TOOL IN

04:04:48.840 --> 04:04:50.342
THIS INSTANCE AND I THINK MY

04:04:50.409 --> 04:04:52.244
CLIENTS LOOK AT IT FROM THE

04:04:52.310 --> 04:04:54.079
POINT OF VIEW OF WELL HOW

04:04:54.146 --> 04:04:56.048
DO WE LIMIT THE USE IT'S NOT

04:04:56.114 --> 04:04:57.549
THE EXCEPTION YOU KNOW LET'S

04:04:57.616 --> 04:04:59.351
EXEMPT THIS FACILITY HERE THIS

04:04:59.418 --> 04:05:00.652
ENVIRONMENT -- THAT ENVIRONMENT

04:05:00.719 --> 04:05:02.421
IT'S MORE ALONG THE LINES OF

04:05:02.487 --> 04:05:04.056
HOW DO WE LIMIT THE USE IN

04:05:04.122 --> 04:05:05.791
THE LIMIT THE BIO AVAILABILITY

04:05:05.857 --> 04:05:07.125
OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THESE

04:05:07.192 --> 04:05:09.327
MATERIALS TO WILDLIFE FOR THE

04:05:09.394 --> 04:05:12.030
ANIMALS THAT WILDLIFE AND THAT

04:05:12.097 --> 04:05:14.866
IS THROUGH A A IT'S A PROCESS

04:05:14.933 --> 04:05:17.002
RIGHT IN IT IN THE EARLIER I

04:05:17.069 --> 04:05:18.370
DID MY BEST TO DESCRIBE SORT

04:05:18.437 --> 04:05:20.639
OF HOW THE PROCESS OF EXCLUSION

04:05:20.705 --> 04:05:23.041
EXTERMINATION WORKS IN AN

04:05:23.108 --> 04:05:24.810
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU'RE TRYING

04:05:24.876 --> 04:05:26.244
TO KEEP THE COLOSSAL RODENTS

04:05:26.311 --> 04:05:27.779
AWAY FROM THE BUILDING BY YOU

04:05:27.846 --> 04:05:30.015
KNOW LURING AWAY FOR BUILDING

04:05:30.082 --> 04:05:31.917
BEATING OUT PASSED THE BOROUGH

04:05:31.983 --> 04:05:33.985
YOU KNOW SORT OF CREATING

04:05:34.052 --> 04:05:36.088
FORAGE FOR THEM THAT IS AWAY

04:05:36.154 --> 04:05:37.355
FROM THE AREA THAT YOU WANT TO

04:05:37.422 --> 04:05:39.291
PROTECT FROM THAT TO RODENTS

04:05:39.357 --> 04:05:40.826
AND SO IN THAT INVOLVES NOT

04:05:40.892 --> 04:05:42.627
JUST THE THE THE BAIT THAT'S

04:05:42.694 --> 04:05:44.729
A ESTAR BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES

04:05:44.796 --> 04:05:46.398
OTHER MATERIALS INVOLVES

04:05:46.465 --> 04:05:49.267
TRAPPING DETECTIVE PRESENCE NO

04:05:49.334 --> 04:05:51.436
NOT EVERY BIG BOX YOU LOOK AT

04:05:51.503 --> 04:05:53.705
HAS POISON IN IT AND SO IT'S

04:05:53.772 --> 04:05:55.774
IT'S IT'S A IT'S THE SYSTEM OF

04:05:55.841 --> 04:05:58.243
EXCLUSION AND AND CONTROL YOU

04:05:58.310 --> 04:06:00.145
KNOW IT ALSO INCLUDES YOU KNOW

04:06:00.212 --> 04:06:03.115
-- REPRODUCTIVE DESTRUCTION AND

04:06:03.181 --> 04:06:05.684
SO I THINK WE'LL I DON'T LOOK

04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:07.319
AT IT AS WHAT THE EXCEPTION

04:06:07.385 --> 04:06:08.553
SHOULD BE I LOOK AT IT FROM

04:06:08.620 --> 04:06:09.988
WHAT'S THE PROCESS THAT SHOULD

04:06:10.055 --> 04:06:12.424
BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO LIMIT

04:06:12.491 --> 04:06:14.726
THE USE TO ONLY THOSE INSTANCES

04:06:14.793 --> 04:06:17.028
OR TO THOSE INSTANCES WHERE

04:06:17.095 --> 04:06:18.463
THEY ARE NECESSARY TO KNOCK

04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:20.232
DOWN A GROWING POPULATION OR

04:06:20.298 --> 04:06:21.633
POPULATION IT IS GOT OUT OF

04:06:21.700 --> 04:06:23.401
CONTROL I WOULD ARGUE THAT

04:06:23.468 --> 04:06:24.736
THE POPULATION IN DOWNTOWN

04:06:24.803 --> 04:06:26.004
LOS ANGELES AT SOME POINTS

04:06:26.071 --> 04:06:27.639
HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL

04:06:27.706 --> 04:06:28.707
AND I WILL BET YOU A DOLLAR

04:06:28.773 --> 04:06:30.308
TO A DONNA THAT THE ONE OF THE

04:06:30.375 --> 04:06:31.443
METHODS ARE USED TO CONTROL

04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:33.545
THOSE MUSCLE RODENTS WAS

04:06:33.612 --> 04:06:36.114
PROBABLY A NASCAR OR SOME RAP

04:06:36.181 --> 04:06:37.983
WAYS THEY'RE DESIGNED TO KILL

04:06:38.049 --> 04:06:39.084
THE WORD WE'RE NOT RUNNING

04:06:39.151 --> 04:06:40.252
AWAY FROM THAT THAT'S THAT'S

04:06:40.318 --> 04:06:42.254
THEIR MAIN PURPOSE -- AND

04:06:42.320 --> 04:06:43.555
SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO KNOCK

04:06:43.622 --> 04:06:44.956
USES MATERIALS TO KNOCK DOWN

04:06:45.023 --> 04:06:46.291
POPULATION SO THAT YOU CAN

04:06:46.358 --> 04:06:49.494
THEN DEPLOY THE OTHER LESLIE

04:06:49.561 --> 04:06:51.863
FOR LESS TOXIC NON CHEMICAL

04:06:51.930 --> 04:06:54.566
-- METHODS FOR EXCLUSION AND

04:06:54.633 --> 04:06:56.268
CONTROL AND SO THAT'S WHAT

04:06:56.334 --> 04:06:57.869
WE'RE SAYING IS GIVE US THE

04:06:57.936 --> 04:06:59.738
TOOL LET US USE IT IN A VERY

04:06:59.804 --> 04:07:01.873
LIMITED SENSE LET'S LET'S AGREE

04:07:01.940 --> 04:07:04.643
ON WHAT THAT LIMITED SENSE IS

04:07:04.709 --> 04:07:06.178
AND THEN WE CAN MOVE FORWARD

04:07:06.244 --> 04:07:08.213
AND AND HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW AND

04:07:08.280 --> 04:07:10.048
WE FEEL FOR A FAIRLY CONFIDENT

04:07:10.115 --> 04:07:12.517
GIVEN THAT AND ALSO LET'S NOT

04:07:12.584 --> 04:07:13.985
OVERLOOK THE ILLEGAL USE OF

04:07:14.052 --> 04:07:15.687
ASPECT OF THIS EITHER I DON'T

04:07:15.754 --> 04:07:17.088
THINK WE CAN DO THAT YOU KNOW

04:07:17.155 --> 04:07:18.590
AND ALLOWS US ONE MORE THING

04:07:18.657 --> 04:07:20.225
AND I'LL SHUT UP SQUARE WHICH

04:07:20.292 --> 04:07:22.794
IS -- WE HAVE AN AGENCY THAT

04:07:22.861 --> 04:07:24.029
IS TOTALLY DEDICATED TO THIS

04:07:24.095 --> 04:07:25.463
WHICH IS THE DEPARTMENT ASIDE

04:07:25.530 --> 04:07:27.999
REGULATION THIS MATERIAL THIS

04:07:28.066 --> 04:07:29.668
CAR IS UNDER REEVALUATION

04:07:29.734 --> 04:07:32.470
PRESENTLY AT DPR IN THE THAT

04:07:32.537 --> 04:07:34.306
OUT AND AND OUTCOME OF THAT

04:07:34.372 --> 04:07:36.675
WILL BE NEW RESTRICTIONS ON

04:07:36.741 --> 04:07:37.742
THE USE OF THESE MATERIALS

04:07:37.809 --> 04:07:39.311
AND NEW PRACTICES AND LICENSE

04:07:39.377 --> 04:07:41.913
CONDITIONS THAT WILL IN LARGE

04:07:41.980 --> 04:07:44.015
PART RESTRICT THE USE OF THESE

04:07:44.082 --> 04:07:45.183
MATERIALS IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT

04:07:45.250 --> 04:07:47.886
ENVIRONMENTS SO THE THAT'S THE

04:07:47.953 --> 04:07:49.054
BEST ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

04:07:49.120 --> 04:07:51.356
I APOLOGIZE AND SO CAN I

04:07:51.423 --> 04:07:53.124
SAY SOMETHING NICE TO THIRTY

04:07:53.191 --> 04:07:54.292
SECONDS TO FALL FROM THIS POINT

04:07:54.359 --> 04:07:55.293
ON THE TOP OF SURPLUS FROM

AT THAT POINT AND IF THEY

04:08:15.513 --> 04:08:18.316
CAN USE ALTERNATIVE METHODS

04:08:18.383 --> 04:08:20.185

I'M NOT A BIOLOGIST BUT WE'RE

04:09:28.320 --> 04:09:30.355
EXEMPTING CERTAIN INDUSTRIES

04:09:30.422 --> 04:09:31.656

IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO WEAR

04:09:33.425 --> 04:09:36.761
THESE WILDLIFE POPULATIONS

04:09:36.828 --> 04:09:38.063
THAT'S KIND OF THE RUBBER OUR

04:09:38.129 --> 04:09:40.098

TAKING AWAY A TOOL WHEN THAT

04:09:43.568 --> 04:09:45.870
VERY SAME TOOL IS ALLOWABLE IN

04:09:45.937 --> 04:09:48.773
INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE LESS OF

04:09:48.840 --> 04:09:50.709
A RISK IF THEY WERE TO HAVE AN

04:09:50.775 --> 04:09:52.110
INFESTATION WE CAN'T CLAIM THE

04:09:52.177 --> 04:09:53.745
PUBLIC EMERGENCY IS BY THE TIME

04:09:53.812 --> 04:09:54.979
IT GETS TO EMERGENCY WE'VE BEEN

SHUT OUT WE'VE GOT OUR BIGGER

04:09:56.948 --> 04:09:59.684
PROFITS AND SO THAT'S KIND

04:09:59.751 --> 04:10:00.885
OF THE THE PLEADING ARGUMENT

04:10:00.952 --> 04:10:03.688
ON OUR END IS WE GET IT WE'RE

04:10:03.755 --> 04:10:04.823
THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL WE

04:10:04.889 --> 04:10:06.558
SUPPORT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT

04:10:06.624 --> 04:10:08.159
-- AND IN THE EVENTUALLY RIGHT

04:10:08.226 --> 04:10:09.461
INTO ME TO CUT YOU OFF BUT I

04:10:09.527 --> 04:10:10.929
MEAN ARE BY TECH BROTHER IN

04:10:10.995 --> 04:10:13.098
ARE GOING TO DEVELOP HOPEFULLY

04:10:13.164 --> 04:10:15.333
ALTERNATIVES PLEASE BETTER WAYS

04:10:15.400 --> 04:10:16.368
OF DOING THIS HOPEFULLY WE'LL

04:10:16.434 --> 04:10:17.335
FIGURE THIS PROBLEM OUT BUT

04:10:17.402 --> 04:10:19.571
RIGHT NOW TO DAY IT IS ONE OF

04:10:19.637 --> 04:10:20.739
THE TOOLS IN THE TOOL BOX THAT

04:10:20.805 --> 04:10:23.241
WE HAVE TO RELY ON IF WE HAVE

04:10:23.308 --> 04:10:25.377
A PROBLEM IT NEEDS TO BE DEALT

04:10:25.443 --> 04:10:27.779
WITH QUICKLY EFFECTIVELY AND

04:10:27.846 --> 04:10:32.484
IN A MANNER THAT WE CAN CONTROL

04:10:32.550 --> 04:10:34.285
ALRIGHT I THINK WHAT WE'VE

04:10:34.352 --> 04:10:35.487
HEARD TODAY IN WHAT IS

04:10:35.553 --> 04:10:36.888
ABSOLUTELY PARAMOUNT TO

04:10:36.955 --> 04:10:38.623
EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND IT IS

04:10:38.690 --> 04:10:42.160
A QUESTION OF BALANCE WE MUST

04:10:42.227 --> 04:10:45.096
STRIKE A BALANCE I WORK VERY

04:10:45.163 --> 04:10:48.433
HARD IN MY INDUSTRY FOR I AM

04:10:48.500 --> 04:10:51.636
NOT A PEST MANAGER WE WORK FOR

04:10:51.703 --> 04:10:53.671
THE PAST MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY

04:10:53.738 --> 04:10:55.974
TO GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES WE

04:10:56.040 --> 04:10:58.176
ALSO INTRODUCE A GREAT DEAL

04:10:58.243 --> 04:10:59.944
OF SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND IN

04:11:00.011 --> 04:11:02.347
STUDY I BEGAN IN THE BIOTECH

04:11:02.414 --> 04:11:04.616
INDUSTRY HOWEVER IT SCRIPTS

04:11:04.682 --> 04:11:05.984
RESEARCH IN LAHORE YEAH WE HAD

04:11:06.050 --> 04:11:07.652
VERY FEW RATS EVERYTHING WAS

04:11:07.719 --> 04:11:10.688
A CLEAN ROOM AND I THINK THAT

04:11:10.755 --> 04:11:12.957
IF WE WERE TO GATHER AND A

04:11:13.024 --> 04:11:15.160
SPECIAL LEE WITH THE LEADERSHIP

04:11:15.226 --> 04:11:19.264
YOUR -- WITH ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM

04:11:19.330 --> 04:11:21.366
WE WILL BE ABLE TO STRIKE IT

04:11:21.433 --> 04:11:25.103
WHAT HERE'S THE PAIN THAT WE

04:11:25.170 --> 04:11:27.472
ALL HAVE TO FACE FROM TIME TO

04:11:27.539 --> 04:11:29.908
TIME WHAT IS THE FIRST STEP

04:11:29.974 --> 04:11:31.876
IS THAT FIRST STEP GONNA COME

04:11:31.943 --> 04:11:35.113
FROM CALIFORNIA I GUARANTEE YOU

04:11:35.180 --> 04:11:37.248
IT'S NOT GONNA COME FROM OHIO

04:11:37.315 --> 04:11:38.483
AND I DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND

04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:41.920
ANYONE THEIR ARMS SAYING IT IS

04:11:41.986 --> 04:11:44.122
LEADERSHIP IT IS A KNOWLEDGE

04:11:44.189 --> 04:11:45.857
BEING IT IS MOVING FORWARD

04:11:45.924 --> 04:11:47.725
AS A GROUP ALL OF US WORKING

04:11:47.792 --> 04:11:49.961
TOGETHER AND WE'D BETTER TAKE

04:11:50.028 --> 04:11:53.164
THAT FIRST STEP WE HAVE BEEN

04:11:53.231 --> 04:11:54.232
ON THE JURISDICTIONS THAT

04:11:54.299 --> 04:11:55.934
HAVE -- IMPLEMENTED SOMETHING

04:11:56.000 --> 04:11:58.136
SIMILAR TO THIS WELL WE HAVE

04:11:58.203 --> 04:11:59.304
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO SEE THE

04:11:59.370 --> 04:12:02.006
RESULTS IN THE IMPACT I DON'T

04:12:02.073 --> 04:12:02.874
THINK SO I THINK WE'RE IN

04:12:02.941 --> 04:12:05.410
THE LEAD HERE OKAY SENATOR

04:12:05.477 --> 04:12:06.644
FAR WE HAVE BEEN THERE VINCE

04:12:06.711 --> 04:12:08.880
IS CITIES RIGHT AND DO WE

04:12:08.947 --> 04:12:09.781
KNOW WHAT THE RESULTS HAVE

04:12:09.848 --> 04:12:10.782
BEEN IN THE CITIES THAT HAVE

04:12:10.849 --> 04:12:13.084
DONE THIS IN TERMS OF PUBLIC

04:12:13.151 --> 04:12:20.258
HEALTH IMPACTS ON THE RIGHT

04:12:20.325 --> 04:12:24.295
YEAH WELL YOU KNOW WE --

04:12:24.362 --> 04:12:25.330

04:12:25.396 --> 04:12:27.632
TIMES THAT LA HAS -- IS IS

04:12:27.699 --> 04:12:29.067
AN EGG EXAMPLE THAT SHOULD BE

04:12:29.133 --> 04:12:31.035
HELD UP LA IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S

04:12:31.102 --> 04:12:32.337
HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES RIGHT

04:12:32.403 --> 04:12:34.372
NOW IS AN EXCEPTION -- IT'S

04:12:34.439 --> 04:12:36.374
AN EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCE

04:12:36.441 --> 04:12:40.345
-- AND -- MAYOR GARCETTI JUST

04:12:40.411 --> 04:12:42.780
TODAY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT HE IS

04:12:42.847 --> 04:12:44.682
TAKING STEPS TO DEAL WITH THAT

04:12:44.749 --> 04:12:48.019
SITUATION WHICH MEANS CLEANING

04:12:48.086 --> 04:12:49.554
UP TRASH AND HAVING A NEW

04:12:49.621 --> 04:12:52.357
APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THAT --

04:12:52.423 --> 04:12:54.092
AREAS OF DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES

04:12:54.158 --> 04:12:55.827
OUR FREE OF TRASH AND THAT IS

04:12:55.894 --> 04:13:00.331
IN EFFECT -- -- PROBLEM AND

04:13:00.398 --> 04:13:02.967
GOING AFTER IT AT ITS SOURCE --

04:13:03.034 --> 04:13:03.868
AND THAT'S WHAT WE ALL NEED TO

04:13:03.935 --> 04:13:06.337
DO TO CONTROL PASS BUT IF I IF

04:13:06.404 --> 04:13:08.573
I MIGHT MISTER CHAIR -- RESPOND

04:13:08.640 --> 04:13:10.942
VERY BRIEFLY TO SENATOR BATES

04:13:11.009 --> 04:13:14.546
WHO VERY CLEARLY ASKED FOR --

04:13:14.612 --> 04:13:17.515
-- WHAT WITH THE EXCEPTIONS

04:13:17.582 --> 04:13:19.417
BE WOULD EXEMPT WHAT WHAT EXIT

04:13:19.484 --> 04:13:21.653
WITH AN EXEMPTION LOOK LIKE

04:13:21.719 --> 04:13:23.655
AND THE RESPONSE THAT CAME

04:13:23.721 --> 04:13:25.857
BACK WAS WHAT WOULD RATHER

04:13:25.924 --> 04:13:27.792
TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE WOULD

04:13:27.859 --> 04:13:29.394
LIKE TO TALK ABOUT LIMITING

04:13:29.460 --> 04:13:31.863
USE AND -- AS I WAS LISTENING

04:13:31.930 --> 04:13:33.164
TO THAT CONVERSATION WHAT I

04:13:33.231 --> 04:13:37.001
WAS HEARING AS WE'D LIKE TO

04:13:37.068 --> 04:13:40.338
IDENTIFY WHAT IN OUR INDUSTRY

04:13:40.405 --> 04:13:43.041
TO BE CONSIDERED BEST PRACTICES

04:13:43.107 --> 04:13:45.276
I TAKE IT AS A GIVEN THAT

04:13:45.343 --> 04:13:47.045
IN THE PAST CONTROL INDUSTRY

04:13:47.111 --> 04:13:49.447
THEY'RE ALREADY EMPLOYING THIS

04:13:49.514 --> 04:13:51.916
ISSUE'S BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS

04:13:51.983 --> 04:13:53.084
SO I BELIEVE THEY'RE ALREADY

04:13:53.151 --> 04:13:55.787
EMPLOYING WHAT THEY BELIEVE OUR

04:13:55.853 --> 04:13:58.723
BEST PRACTICES BUT THE PROBLEM

04:13:58.790 --> 04:14:01.159
WE'VE IDENTIFIED HAS NOT GONE

04:14:01.225 --> 04:14:04.562
AWAY IT HAS EITHER MAINTAINED

04:14:04.629 --> 04:14:07.899
OR INCREASED AND ITS SEVERITY

04:14:07.966 --> 04:14:09.968
AND SO THE BEST PRACTICE THAT

04:14:10.034 --> 04:14:11.569
THE INDUSTRY WOULD LIKE TO

04:14:11.636 --> 04:14:14.305
FOLLOW IS NOT WORKING FOR

04:14:14.372 --> 04:14:16.374
THIS PROBLEM AND THAT'S WHY

04:14:16.441 --> 04:14:19.777
WE'RE HERE TODAY NOW WE HAVE

04:14:19.844 --> 04:14:22.614
IDENTIFIED EXCEPTIONS THAT WERE

04:14:22.680 --> 04:14:25.116
WILLING TO WORK ON WITH VARIOUS

04:14:25.183 --> 04:14:26.351
PARTS OF THE INDUSTRY YOU

04:14:26.417 --> 04:14:29.454
HEARD ME SAY THAT WE WILL --

04:14:29.520 --> 04:14:31.823
WORK HARD ON THOSE TO ACHIEVE

04:14:31.889 --> 04:14:33.992
ACHIEVE A COMPROMISE I'M AND

04:14:34.058 --> 04:14:35.259
YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT THAT

04:14:35.326 --> 04:14:38.429
WE WILL DO THAT SURE IF I MAY

04:14:38.496 --> 04:14:39.964
JUST TO BE CLEAR AND IS A VERY

04:14:40.031 --> 04:14:42.500
BRIEF TO MR BLOOM'S POINT WE

04:14:42.567 --> 04:14:44.435
DID OFFER AS AN EXCEPTION TO

04:14:44.502 --> 04:14:45.903
MR BLOOM AS AN AMENDMENT AS A

04:14:45.970 --> 04:14:47.538
CONCEPT OF IN A MOMENT AND IT

04:14:47.605 --> 04:14:50.341
WAS REJECTED BY HIM AND THE --

04:14:50.408 --> 04:14:51.843
PROPONENTS IN THAT EXCEPTION

04:14:51.909 --> 04:14:54.112
WOULD HAVE BEEN A FARM TO FORK

04:14:54.178 --> 04:14:55.647
WHAT WE CALL THE FARM TO FORK

04:14:55.713 --> 04:14:57.515
EXCEPTION WHICH IS ALL THE WAY

04:14:57.582 --> 04:14:59.517
FROM THE FARM TO A COMMERCIAL

04:14:59.584 --> 04:15:01.653
OR KITCHEN AREA WHERE IT'S

04:15:01.719 --> 04:15:03.021
VERY IMPORTANT TO YOU EXCLUDING

04:15:03.087 --> 04:15:04.188
KEEPRITE TIMELY FOR HERE WAS

04:15:04.255 --> 04:15:05.490
A THAT WAS TOO BROAD YEAH I

04:15:05.556 --> 04:15:07.058
BELIEVE IT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT

04:15:07.125 --> 04:15:09.761
SO MY POINT WASN'T THAT I WANT

04:15:09.827 --> 04:15:10.995
A BROADER THING BECAUSE I WANNA

04:15:11.062 --> 04:15:14.298
TALK PROCESS MY POINT WAS THAT

04:15:14.365 --> 04:15:15.733
I WE HAVE OFFERED EXCEPTIONS

04:15:15.800 --> 04:15:17.568
THERE IS CONCERN AT EVERY

04:15:17.635 --> 04:15:18.770
EXCEPTIONAL LONG THE WAY YOU

04:15:18.836 --> 04:15:20.304
HEARD FROM OTHER PEOPLE ASKING

04:15:20.371 --> 04:15:21.639
FOR AN EXCEPTION THAT THEY

04:15:21.706 --> 04:15:23.374
COULD BE TOO BROAD AND WHAT I

04:15:23.441 --> 04:15:25.777
AM SUGGESTING IS IS THAT THERE

04:15:25.843 --> 04:15:27.445
MIGHT BE A WAY TO TIGHTEN IT

04:15:27.512 --> 04:15:29.714
DOWN NOT TO THE EXCEPTION WHICH

04:15:29.781 --> 04:15:30.982
I THINK IS AN ARTFUL BECAUSE IT

04:15:31.049 --> 04:15:32.917
COVERS LARGE SWATHS OF LAND BUT

04:15:32.984 --> 04:15:34.686
THROUGH THE PROCESS IN WHICH

04:15:34.752 --> 04:15:37.055
THESE MATERIALS ARE DEPLOYED

04:15:37.121 --> 04:15:38.389
AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER

04:15:38.456 --> 04:15:40.058
WHICH THEY'RE DEPLOYED WHICH

04:15:40.124 --> 04:15:42.226
IS A RESPECTIVE OF LOCATION

04:15:42.293 --> 04:15:43.995
TYPE BUSINESS ALL RIGHT THAT

04:15:44.062 --> 04:15:46.431
WAS THE THE SPIRIT BEHIND WHAT

04:15:46.497 --> 04:15:49.133
I SAID IT WAS NOT TO FIND A

04:15:49.200 --> 04:15:51.102
BROADER EXCEPTION FOR THIS

04:15:51.169 --> 04:15:53.805
BILL TO WRITE RIGHT NOW -- IS

04:15:53.871 --> 04:15:55.840
ANYBODY WHAT ARE THE RULES AS

04:15:55.907 --> 04:15:59.143
TO WHO CAN ACTUALLY APPLY THE

04:15:59.210 --> 04:16:01.979
THURMOND DECIDES BEGINNING

04:16:02.046 --> 04:16:03.347
WITH ME LICENSE PEST CONTROL

04:16:03.414 --> 04:16:05.349
OPERATORS ONLY YOU CAN ONLY

04:16:05.416 --> 04:16:06.384
BE DONE BY WAS A TWENTY FOUR

04:16:06.451 --> 04:16:07.719
TRY AS A TWENTY FOURTEEN IS

04:16:07.785 --> 04:16:08.786
A HOMEOWNER I CAN'T BUY IT

04:16:08.853 --> 04:16:11.489
ONLINE SURELY I SHOULD BE ABLE

04:16:11.556 --> 04:16:13.024
TO I COULD I SHOULD BE ABLE

04:16:13.091 --> 04:16:15.293
TO YEAH -- -- SO BUT SO THAT

04:16:15.359 --> 04:16:16.694
WOULD SUGGEST THE KIND OF MODEL

04:16:16.761 --> 04:16:17.995
YEARS TALKING ABOUT AND YET WE

04:16:18.062 --> 04:16:21.099
STILL HAVE OUTLINES DYING SO IF

04:16:21.165 --> 04:16:22.166
WHAT'S GOING WRONG HERE I MEAN

04:16:22.233 --> 04:16:23.801
IF I GET I GET THAT ARGUMENT

04:16:23.868 --> 04:16:24.702
IF WE WERE STILL ALLOWING YOU

04:16:24.769 --> 04:16:26.404
TO BE OFF THE SHELF BUT AGAIN

04:16:26.471 --> 04:16:27.472
A LITTLE BIT BEYOND MY SCOPE

04:16:27.538 --> 04:16:28.906
FROM A MICROBIOLOGY STANDPOINT

04:16:28.973 --> 04:16:29.774
BUT IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING

04:16:29.841 --> 04:16:31.209
THAT SOME OF AFTER THE COLLAPSE

04:16:31.275 --> 04:16:32.510
THE ON THAT MOUNTAIN LINE

04:16:32.577 --> 04:16:34.645
-- SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS

04:16:34.712 --> 04:16:37.048
ARE FOUND WERE NOT OBTAINED

04:16:37.115 --> 04:16:38.483
LEGALLY OR ILLEGALLY IN THE

04:16:38.549 --> 04:16:39.550
CITY CALIFORNIA SOME OF THEM

04:16:39.617 --> 04:16:41.385
CAME FROM OTHER COUNTRIES I'M

04:16:41.452 --> 04:16:43.087
EARLY SOUTH OF US SOME OF COME

04:16:43.154 --> 04:16:44.255
FROM OTHER STATES WERE STILL

04:16:44.322 --> 04:16:45.423
LEGAL TO PURCHASE THESE THINGS

04:16:45.490 --> 04:16:47.625
THERE'S NO RESTRICTION ON

04:16:47.692 --> 04:16:49.127
BY YET ANOTHER STATE DRIVING

04:16:49.193 --> 04:16:50.795
ACROSS AND ILLEGALLY USING

04:16:50.862 --> 04:16:52.130
IT OR OVER USING IN THE CITY

04:16:52.196 --> 04:16:54.699
CALIFORNIA SO I NO RESTRICTION

04:16:54.766 --> 04:16:56.634
ON THAT BUT THAT WOULD BE THAT

04:16:56.701 --> 04:16:57.535
WOULD BE COVERED IN THIS BILL

04:16:57.602 --> 04:17:00.471
NOW FOR SPENT AN ISSUE WAS

04:17:00.538 --> 04:17:02.573
BUT I THINK HE FOR SPECIFIC

04:17:02.640 --> 04:17:03.641
POSSESSION WOULD BE ILLEGAL

04:17:03.708 --> 04:17:06.077
NOW UNDER THIS BILL IT'S GOING

04:17:06.144 --> 04:17:08.412
OF COURSE WELL GOOD FOR IS

04:17:08.479 --> 04:17:09.947
ANY IN POSSESSION WOULD BE

04:17:10.014 --> 04:17:11.449
ILLEGAL UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY

04:17:11.516 --> 04:17:14.952
EXEMPTED AG WINERIES SAUDIS

04:17:15.019 --> 04:17:16.654
BUT I MEAN THAT IS THE IN

04:17:16.721 --> 04:17:17.455
GO BACK TO THE POINT I MADE

04:17:17.522 --> 04:17:18.523
EARLIER AND I'M GONNA GET

04:17:18.589 --> 04:17:20.424
DIVORCED HIS NAM SAID IT TWICE

04:17:20.491 --> 04:17:22.126
-- RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET

04:17:22.193 --> 04:17:23.094
FROM ONE ANOTHER YOU'VE GOT A

04:17:23.161 --> 04:17:25.029
MAJOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY

04:17:25.096 --> 04:17:26.097
FOR DRUGS AND THEN ACROSS THE

04:17:26.164 --> 04:17:28.166
STREET A MAJOR BREWERY ONE

04:17:28.232 --> 04:17:29.300
IS EXEMPTED AND THE OTHER IS

04:17:29.367 --> 04:17:32.670
NOT -- THE THE THE MIGRATORY

04:17:32.737 --> 04:17:34.605
PATHWAYS OF THESE ANIMALS ARE

04:17:34.672 --> 04:17:36.374
THEY REALLY MAKING A U.

04:17:36.440 --> 04:17:38.476
TURN AFTER EATING THE GOOD

04:17:38.543 --> 04:17:39.577
STUFF HERE THE BAD STUFF HERE

04:17:39.644 --> 04:17:40.745
THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT THEY'RE

04:17:40.812 --> 04:17:42.180
INCREDIBLY CHASING ONE ANOTHER

04:17:42.246 --> 04:17:45.283
SO IF ONE IS USING LEGALLY EVEN

04:17:45.349 --> 04:17:46.450
AND CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND

04:17:46.517 --> 04:17:47.485
THE OTHER ONE IS PROHIBITED

04:17:47.552 --> 04:17:49.320
FROM USING THERE IS THERE

04:17:49.387 --> 04:17:51.656
IS SOME FUNDAMENTAL SORT OF

04:17:51.722 --> 04:17:52.824
THERE'S SOME FRICTION THERE AND

04:17:52.890 --> 04:17:53.724
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS

04:17:53.791 --> 04:17:55.259

USE ON THE ISLAND OF CATALINA

04:17:58.796 --> 04:18:00.198
PERFECT SENSE IS THAT'S AN

04:18:00.264 --> 04:18:01.032
ENVIRONMENT WHERE YOU'RE

04:18:01.098 --> 04:18:02.333

LEVEL SO YEAH OKAY WHAT IT IN
