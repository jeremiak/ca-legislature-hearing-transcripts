00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:56.368
THERE IS A REAL SOLUTION ON ON-

00:13:56.435 --> 00:14:00.072
SOLVING THIS WITH A- IN MAYBE A

PRIORITY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:58.149
GHOST GUNS HAVE BECOME A COP

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:26.778
A GUN SHOW. THAT'S THOUSANDS

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.313
MORE FIREARMS THAT GO INTO OUR

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.981
COMMUNITIES EVERY TIME THERE'S

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:31.883
A GUN SHOW IN YOUR COUNTY. AND

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:33.551
THIS IS SUCH A DEADLY DEADLY

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:36.121
PROBLEM. AS STUDY AFTER STUDY

00:27:36.187 --> 00:27:38.323
AFTER STUDY HAS SHOWN. MORE

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:40.492
GUNS UNSURPRISINGLY MEANS MORE

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:42.727
GUN VIOLENCE. COUNTRIES WITH

00:27:42.794 --> 00:27:43.461
MORE GUNS HAVE MORE GUN

00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:45.497
VIOLENCE. STATES WITH MORE GUNS

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:46.998
HAVE MORE GUN VIOLENCE.

00:27:47.065 --> 00:27:49.501
HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE GUNS ARE

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:50.101
MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE GUN

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:52.070
VIOLENCE. NOW SINCE THAT

00:27:52.137 --> 00:27:53.605
WEEKEND WHEN WE EXPERIENCE THE-

00:27:53.671 --> 00:27:55.440
PASO IN DAYTON SHOOTINGS. THE

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:56.908
WEEKEND WHEN I VOWED AND GUN

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:57.842
SHOWS AT THE COUNTY FAIR

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.244
GROUNDS WE HAVE HAD HUNDREDS OF

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.613
MASS SHOOTINGS. INCLUDING THE

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:02.580
MASS SHOOTING LAST WEEK IN SAN

00:28:02.647 --> 00:28:06.117
JOSE. AND THE SHOOTING ORANGE

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:06.684
IN MY DISTRICT EARLIER THIS

00:28:06.751 --> 00:28:08.620
YEAR. OVER FIFTY THOUSAND

00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:10.522
AMERICANS AND MANY CALIFORNIANS

00:28:10.588 --> 00:28:12.390
HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES. DUE TO

00:28:12.457 --> 00:28:14.492
GUN VIOLENCE INCLUDING THE NINE

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:15.894
VICTIMS OF LAST WEEK'S SAN JOSE

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.762
SHOOTING. AS WELL AS THIS

00:28:17.829 --> 00:28:18.696
COMPUTING WITH SIX YEAR OLD

00:28:18.763 --> 00:28:20.498
BOY. APPARENTLY DUE TO ROAD

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:22.634
RAGE AND MY DISTRICT ON THE

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.368
FIFTY FIVE JUST A FEW WEEKS

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:25.403
AGO. NO WE DON'T KNOW WHERE

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.739
THOSE GUNS WERE WERE PICKED UP.

00:28:27.806 --> 00:28:28.606
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE

00:28:28.673 --> 00:28:29.808
PURCHASED THE GUNS USED TO

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:31.609
COMMIT THOSE MURDERS. BUT IT IS

00:28:31.676 --> 00:28:33.978
VERY LIKELY THAT MANY OF THEM

00:28:34.045 --> 00:28:35.814
HAVE COME FROM GUN SHOWS. EACH

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.715
ONE OF THESE VIOLENT DEATHS.

00:28:37.782 --> 00:28:38.750
FOR A MASSIVE HOLE IN THEIR

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.186
FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:28:41.252 --> 00:28:42.854
AMONG THEIR LOVED ONES. NEVER

00:28:42.921 --> 00:28:44.122
POINTED SO THESE COUNTRIES

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:45.390
ARGUE THAT ENDING GUN SHOWS

00:28:45.457 --> 00:28:47.292
WILL DEPRIVE THEM OF REVENUE.

00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:49.461
HE'S GONE SHOW CAN BRING IN UP

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:50.028
TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:51.663
DOLLARS TO THE FAIRGROUNDS. BUT

00:28:51.729 --> 00:28:54.065
THIS IS JUST A SMALL FRACTION

00:28:54.132 --> 00:28:54.632
OF THE REVENUE GENERATED BY

00:28:54.699 --> 00:28:56.401
FAIRGROUNDS. MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:28:56.468 --> 00:28:57.802
THOUGH IT IS UNDISPUTABLE THAT

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.571
THE COSTS OF GUN VIOLENCE

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:02.774
ECONOMIC MORAL SPIRITUAL. ARE

00:29:02.841 --> 00:29:04.876
ASTRONOMICALLY HIGHER. THE

00:29:04.943 --> 00:29:06.177
OPPOSITION ALSO CLAIMS THAT

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:08.179
THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR AND EACH

00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.047
COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS SHOULD BE

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:09.914
ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN

00:29:09.981 --> 00:29:11.516
DECISIONS ON WHETHER TO ACCEPT

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.051
OR DENY GUN SHOWS AS A MATTER

00:29:13.118 --> 00:29:15.453
OF LOCAL CONTROL. AS A MATTER

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.322
OF SUBSTANCE THIS IS INCORRECT.

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:18.323
WHEN YOU TALK TO THE BOARD

00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:20.058
MEMBERS OF COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS.

00:29:20.125 --> 00:29:21.392
THEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY-

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:23.061
NO FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:24.729
LOCAL COMMUNITY. THEIR SOLE

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:26.865
DUTY. IS TO ENSURE THE SOLVENCY

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:28.166
THEIR PROGRAMS AND THEY TELL

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.601
YOU THAT THEY'RE OBLIGATED TO

00:29:29.667 --> 00:29:30.602
CONTRACT WITH GUN SHOW

00:29:30.668 --> 00:29:32.303
OPERATORS. NO MATTER WHAT THE

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.405
PEOPLE IN THEIR LOCAL

00:29:34.472 --> 00:29:35.740
COMMUNITIES MIGHT WANT OR SAY.

00:29:35.807 --> 00:29:37.041
BUT I ALSO WANT TO PUSH BACK ON

00:29:37.108 --> 00:29:38.443
THE ARGUMENT LOCAL CONTROL AS A

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.478
MATTER OF PRINCIPLE. THIS

00:29:40.545 --> 00:29:42.514
AUGUST BODY SETS THE STANDARD

00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:43.515
FOR THE STATE AND THEIR MANY

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.483
INSTANCES IN WHICH WE DECIDE

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:46.050
THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.286
STATEWIDE VALUES. THAT WE WANT

00:29:48.353 --> 00:29:50.188
TO DICTATE REGARDLESS OF WHAT

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:52.190
LOCALS MIGHT THINK. WE REQUIRE

00:29:52.257 --> 00:29:53.458
THAT EVERY CHILD BE VACCINATED

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:54.058
WITH DESPITE WHAT THE

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.660
PROTESTERS OUTSIDE MIGHT MIGHT

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:57.195
DEMAND. WE REQUIRE THAT

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.429
WORKPLACES BE SAFE FROM

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.764
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS OR SEXUAL

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.733
HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT. WE

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:03.101
REQUIRE THAT CERTAIN HEALTH AND

00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:04.836
LABOR STANDARDS BE MET WE DO

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.204
THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT OF

00:30:06.271 --> 00:30:07.238
COURSETHERE ARE SOME LOCAL

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:09.707
JURISDICTIONS THAT MIGHT

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:10.275
DISAGREE WITH OUR STATEWIDE

00:30:10.341 --> 00:30:11.843
VALUES. AND THAT IS WHAT THIS

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:12.810
IS ABOUT TODAY IT'S ABOUT

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.979

00:30:15.046 --> 00:30:16.414
HIS BODY WE WILL BE SAYING

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:17.782
LOUDLY. THAT THE STATE OF

00:30:17.849 --> 00:30:19.117
CALIFORNIA IS NOT GOING TO

00:30:19.184 --> 00:30:20.585
CONTINUE SANCTIONING. AND

00:30:20.652 --> 00:30:22.253
ENDORSING THE DISTRIBUTION OF

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.289
MORE GUNS IN OUR COMMUNITIES

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:26.324
OUT OF STATE PROPERTY. WELL WE

00:30:26.391 --> 00:30:27.091
RESPECT THE CONTOURS OF THE

RIGHTS OF PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS

TO LEGALLY SELL GUNS ON PRIVATE

00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:33.531

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.366
ALLOW STATE PROPERTY. PROPERTY

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:36.968
THIS TAXPAYER OWNED TO BE USED

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:40.138
TO DISSEMINATE MORE GUNS. AND

00:30:40.205 --> 00:30:40.738
HENCE MORE GUN VIOLENCE IN OUR

LIVES LOST TO GUN VIOLENCE.

00:30:50.548 --> 00:30:52.283
THIS SENSELESS VIOLENCE HAS

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.850
RAVAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS

00:30:52.917 --> 00:30:54.919

AMENDMENT ALLOWS PRIVATE

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:09.400
PARTIES TO OWN GUNS BUT IT DOES

00:31:09.467 --> 00:31:10.902
NOT REQUIRE THAT OUR STATE

00:31:10.969 --> 00:31:12.937
PLAYED ACTIVE ROLE IN HELPING

LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THAT THE

GUNS. AND GUNVIOLENCE AND IT

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:26.251

WHICH IS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:12.149

00:39:12.216 --> 00:39:14.118
DENOMINATOR AMONG ALL OF THE

ANECDOTALLY ARE NOT WORDS THAT

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:22.259
BELONG IN THE CONTEXT OF TRYING

00:39:22.326 --> 00:39:23.728
TO CONVINCE SOMEONE TO SUPPORT

00:39:23.794 --> 00:39:25.296
A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT IS

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:27.498
GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING

00:39:27.565 --> 00:39:28.632
ABLE TO EXERCISE A

00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.601
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THERE IS

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:32.369
NO EVIDENCE THAT IS BEING

THAT. MASS SHOOTINGS THAT TAKE

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.446
PLACE IN CALIFORNIA ARE BEING

00:39:42.513 --> 00:39:44.248

WERE PURCHASED AT A GUN SHOW.

00:39:46.283 --> 00:39:47.718
THAT EVIDENCE JUST ISN'T THERE

00:39:47.785 --> 00:39:49.520

ANECDOTAL IT IS PRESUMED. THAT

00:39:55.926 --> 00:39:57.995
IS A FOOL'S ERRAND TO GO DOWN

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.097
THAT PATH TO SUGGEST THAT YOU

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.099
THINK THIS IS TAKING PLACE IN

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:04.101
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE FIREARMS

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:06.370

A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR

PEOPLE TO BEAR ARMS AND IT'S A

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:13.244
RATE THAT THEY CHOOSE TO

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.545
EXERCISE IN PURCHASING A

00:40:14.612 --> 00:40:16.313
FIREARM AT A GUN SHOW THAT

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.082
HAPPENS TO BE ADDED AT A STATE

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:20.918
FACILITY. MORE IMPORTANTLY

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:22.953
USURPING THE AUTHORITY OF

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.022
LOCALS I THOUGHT FOR THOSE WHO

00:40:25.089 --> 00:40:26.690
CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WAS

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:28.659
SOMETHING THAT WAS JEALOUSLY

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:30.361
GUARDED I THOUGHT WE LIKE TO

00:40:30.427 --> 00:40:33.964
LOCAL CONTROL I GUESS EXCEPT IF

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:34.498
IT'S FOR SOMETHING THAT WE

00:40:34.565 --> 00:40:35.933
DON'T LIKE. BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.435
SELLING T. SHIRTS. THAT WE

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:41.205
DISAGREE WITH OUR MASKS. THE I

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:41.772
HAVE A MESSAGE ON IT THAT WE

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:44.041
DON'T LIKE. BUT THE LOCALS

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:45.209
DECIDE WHAT THEY WANT IN THEIR

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:47.711
COMMUNITIES. THE LOCALS ARE

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.046
VERY GOOD AT LETTING THEIR

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:50.281
LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS KNOW

00:40:50.347 --> 00:40:51.982
WHAT THEY LIKE WHAT THEY DON'T

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:53.751
LIKE AND THEY'RE VERY GOOD AT

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:56.187
EXACTING CHANGE. FROM

THEY WANT. AND I JUST AS A

00:41:02.426 --> 00:41:04.795
FINAL POINT. I DO FIND IT

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:06.964
IRONIC THAT THIS BODY WILL

00:41:07.031 --> 00:41:09.400
HAPPILY VOTE FOR BILLS THAT

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:12.503

GENERAL HAVE MADE NO PROGRESS.

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:19.363
CONFISCATING THE GUNS LAW

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:21.165
REQUIRES THEM TO. WHERE THERE'S

00:43:21.231 --> 00:43:23.033

THOUSAND GUNS THAT'S ONE

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.818

THAN ONE GUY. BUT THE ATTORNEYS

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:54.598
GENERALIZATIONS HAD THEIR STAFF

00:43:54.665 --> 00:43:55.065
COME BEFORE THE BUDGET

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:59.503
COMMITTEE. ONE YEAR IT WAS WELL

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.271

THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T GO DOWN.

00:44:13.417 --> 00:44:14.485
WELL WE COULDN'T HIRE ENOUGH

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:17.721

WHERE THEY'RE AT AND- ALL THAT

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:52.689
LEAVES ME TURNING GENERAL JUST

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:54.191
DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES.

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:55.526
WELL I SAY THAT WE TAKE THAT

00:44:55.592 --> 00:44:57.127
AWAY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:44:57.194 --> 00:44:58.162
AND GIVE IT TO SOMEBODY WHO

00:44:58.228 --> 00:44:59.797
COULD DO THE JOB AND GIVE THE

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.999
MONEY TO LOCAL POLICE. AND

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:05.836
SHERIFF'S. NOT SOMEONE TO HAVE

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:08.072
A GREAT FIGURE IN THAT. BECAUSE

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:10.074
THEY WANT TO DESTROY LAW

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.276
ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA. OR

00:45:12.342 --> 00:45:14.945
DOWNSIZE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:45:15.012 --> 00:45:17.414
CAPABILITIES. THIS IS A NEVER

00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:19.349
NEVER LAND FOLKS. BUT TAKE A

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:22.619
LOOK. WHO'S CREATED SOME OF THE

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:25.355
PROBLEMS. YOUR ATTORNEYS

00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:32.729
GENERAL. ONE OF. IT'S BEEN A

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.298
IT'S BEEN REFERENCE THE DATA IS

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:36.100
NOT COLLECTED I WANTED TO MAKE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:37.968
SURE THAT- WE REMINDED FOLKS

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:39.103
THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY- THE

00:45:39.169 --> 00:45:41.338
LEGISLATURE PASSED ASSEMBLY

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:43.107
BILL TWENTY SIXTY ONE WHICH I

00:45:43.173 --> 00:45:44.875
AUTHORED THAT WORKED TO COLLECT

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:47.044
DATA- WE DO HAVE EVIDENCE THAT

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:48.345
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:50.080
HAD FOUND ILLEGAL SALES BUT WE

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.648
WANTED TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF A

00:45:51.715 --> 00:45:53.617
PROBLEM THIS WAS AND THEREFORE

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:55.652
THIS LEGISLATURE DID PASS-

00:45:55.719 --> 00:45:57.321
THIS. THIS BILL IT WAS

00:45:57.387 --> 00:45:58.722
SUPPORTED BY OUR ATTORNEY

00:45:58.789 --> 00:46:00.524
GENERAL'S OFFICE AND- THERE WAS

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.192
NO OPPOSITION THAT WAS RECEIVED

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:03.627
FOR THAT BILL AS I WANTED TO

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:04.795
MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW THAT

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:06.396
THERE ARE ALSO EXISTING TOOLS

00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:09.166
THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT AT THIS

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.734
BILL. THANK YOU. SENATOR

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:14.705
BURGESS. WHEN PRESIDENT I

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:17.441
WASN'T. I DON'T THINK WE NEED

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:18.942
TO GET INTO A CAR I NEED TO GET

00:46:19.009 --> 00:46:20.944
INTO- THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.046
EARLIER BUT MAYBE I COULD POSE

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:25.249
A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR AND IF

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:26.450
HE'S NOT IN A POSITION TO

00:46:26.517 --> 00:46:28.986
ANSWER IT- MAYBE I CAN GET THE

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:30.821
INFORMATION SOMETIME LATER

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.723
WOULD IT BE EXPRESSED WRITTEN

00:46:32.789 --> 00:46:34.591
OF THE AUTHOR. HE WILL TAKE IT

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:39.763
THERE. SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.465
I'M HEARING TWO DIFFERENT SIDES

00:46:41.532 --> 00:46:43.700
OF THIS ARGUMENT EACH SIDE

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:47.604
SEEMS TO BE LOVING- FAX OR

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:49.439
GENERALIZATION OF FACTS I

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:51.475
SHOULD SAY AGAINST ONE ANOTHER.

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:53.744
SO WHERE IS THE DATA ON THIS

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:54.945
AND IF CALIFORNIA HAS NOT

00:46:55.012 --> 00:46:56.813
ACCUMULATED MAYBE OTHER STATES

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.017
HAVE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE

00:47:00.083 --> 00:47:03.387
CRIMES- THAT ARE ON THE RECORD

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.355
CAN BE TRACED TO A GUN SHOW

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:07.891
PURCHASE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF%

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:11.595
CRIMES OR INVOLVED LLEGALLY

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:14.798
OBTAINED FIREARMS- I THINK WE

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:15.766
HEARD FROM ONE OF OUR

00:47:15.832 --> 00:47:18.202
COLLEAGUES THAT ALL THE MASS

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:20.337
SHOOTINGS WERE FROM- THAT WE'VE

00:47:20.404 --> 00:47:21.939
EXPERIENCED AMERICA ARE FROM

00:47:22.005 --> 00:47:24.041
FIREARMS PURCHASED LEGALLY I

00:47:24.107 --> 00:47:26.009
DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

00:47:26.076 --> 00:47:27.844
AND I WOULD LOVE IF SOMEBODY

00:47:27.911 --> 00:47:29.947
WOULD PUT SOME SCIENCE AND DATA

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.748
INTO THIS DEBATE BECAUSE RIGHT

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:32.516
NOW IT SENDS TENS TO BE

00:47:32.583 --> 00:47:36.186
VISCERAL. AND VERY PASSIONATE

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.054
BUT I THINK IT'S HELPFUL FOR US

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.424
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WE ARE. ON

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.794
THE METRICS. THANK YOU I

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.762
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION. I

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:47.464
WOULD BE EAGER TO WORK WITH YOU

00:47:47.531 --> 00:47:49.933
SENATOR ON MEASURES TO FIND

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.302
MORE DATA AS YOU KNOW CONGRESS

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:54.638
HAS. FOR A LONG TIME HAD A BAN

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:56.240
ON RESEARCH RELATED TO

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:59.943
FIREARMS- AND FATALITIES- AND

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:01.078
SO THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HAMPERED

00:48:01.144 --> 00:48:02.346
SOME OF THIS WAS JUST STARTING

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.581
TO COLLECT THE DATA- AS I

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.283
MENTIONED BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:08.385
DATA ON WHERE THE GUNS GO. AT

00:48:08.452 --> 00:48:10.821
IT IS NOT COLLECTED- WE DO I

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:13.023
WAS TOLD THAT THAT THE IT SORT

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.324
OF ROUGH ESTIMATE MANY

00:48:14.391 --> 00:48:16.426
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. IS

00:48:16.493 --> 00:48:17.928
THAT ROUGHLY HALF OF GUNS ARE

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:21.131
SOLD AT GUN SHOWS AND AS IN

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:21.765
COMMUNITIES LIKE ORANGE COUNTY.

00:48:21.832 --> 00:48:23.300
AND SO IF YOU WERE TO SAY THAT

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:23.967
A GUN THAT WAS LEGALLY

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:26.436
PURCHASED. WAS USED IN A CRIME

00:48:26.503 --> 00:48:28.438
AND I WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUE

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:30.607
FROM MARTINEZ POINTS THAT. YOU

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:31.541
KNOW A LOT OF THE CRIMINAL

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:33.343
ELEMENT TO IT YOU KNOW. THAT

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:34.544
THE PURCHASE OF GUNS LEGALLY

00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:35.679
THEY'RE NOT CRIMINALS UNTIL

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:38.782
THEY GO SHOOT SOMEONE- BUT- YOU

00:48:38.849 --> 00:48:40.117
KNOW I THINK YOU COULD PROBABLY

00:48:40.183 --> 00:48:40.717
HAVE A COIN FLIP I WOULD SAY

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.586
IT'S A COIN FLIP. AT THE TWO

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:44.321
RECENT SHOOTINGS IN ORANGE THE

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:45.822
SHOOTING ON THE FIFTY FIVE OF

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:46.890
THE SIX YEAR OLD BOY IN HIS CAR

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.892
SEAT. THE MASS SHOOTING WE KNOW

00:48:48.959 --> 00:48:50.027
THOSE GUNS WERE WHAT WE KNOW

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:51.361
THAT THE FIRST GUN THE GUNS

00:48:51.428 --> 00:48:52.629
USED IN MASS SHOOTINGS LEGALLY

00:48:52.696 --> 00:48:54.698
PURCHASED THE GUNS. ARE SO IT'S

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:56.500
A COIN FLIP US ARE SAYING THIS

00:48:56.566 --> 00:48:57.601
TO SOME FOLKS- AT THE AG'S

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.436
OFFICE. PROBABLY CONFLICT THAT

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:00.604
THAT THOSE GUNS WERE PURCHASED

00:49:00.671 --> 00:49:01.605
AT A GUN SHOW GIVEN THAT IT WAS

00:49:01.672 --> 00:49:02.973
IN ORANGE COUNTY. BUT WE DON'T

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.041
HAVE THE DATA SO I WOULD BE

00:49:04.107 --> 00:49:05.809
EAGER TO WORK ITH YOU AND

00:49:05.876 --> 00:49:07.377
OTHERS IN THIS BODY. TO TRY TO

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:08.879
FIND THAT DATA WE DO KNOW THIS

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:11.548
HOWEVER THAT. MORE GUNS EQUALS

00:49:11.615 --> 00:49:13.183
MORE GUN VIOLENCE AND I THINK

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.984
THAT YOU KNOW I JUST WANNA BE

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.319
CLEAR THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.286
DISCUSSION ABOUT MASS

00:49:16.353 --> 00:49:18.588
SHOOTINGS. CRIMINAL ELEMENT-

00:49:18.655 --> 00:49:20.090
YOU KNOW THEY COULD BE SUICIDE

00:49:20.157 --> 00:49:21.391
ACCIDENT IT COULD BE SOMEONE A

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.793
DOMESTIC DISPUTE AND BY THE WAY

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.194
MOST GUN SHOOTINGS THAT

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.796
HAPPENED APPEARS IN IN THE PAST

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.364
YEAR A NICKEL BID. FOR

00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:29.333
DOMESTICALLY VIOLENT ASSAULTS

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:30.667
AND SUICIDE. AND THOSE ARE THE

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.269
TYPES OF SHOOTINGS THAT WE SAW

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:33.904
HAPPEN QUITE FREQUENTLY. AND AS

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.205
YOU KNOW IF YOU FOLLOW SUICIDE

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:37.541
STATISTICS- TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:38.842
NOT USING A GUN THE FIRST

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:39.876
ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE DOESN'T

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:41.745
SUCCEED. AND THEN TYPICALLY

00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:42.746
THEY GET HELP AND SO THERE'S

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:44.247
SOME ABILITY TO REHABILITATE

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:46.116
THEMSELVES. OUT WITH A GUN IF

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.351
YOU OWN A GUN THE LIKELIHOOD OF

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.585
COURSE THAT YOU COULD PUT

00:49:48.652 --> 00:49:49.986
YOURSELF IN A SUCCESSFUL THAT

00:49:50.053 --> 00:49:51.421
SUICIDE IS CLOSE TO A HUNDRED

00:49:51.488 --> 00:49:53.156
PERCENT- SO. YOU KNOW THESE ARE

00:49:53.223 --> 00:49:54.291
THE TYPES OF THINGS WERE SAYING

00:49:54.358 --> 00:49:56.226
BUT THERE IS A VERY VERY CLEAR

00:49:56.293 --> 00:49:57.861
INDICATION THAT JUST TAKE MY

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.096
WORD FOR THE HARVARD INJURY

00:49:59.162 --> 00:50:00.597
CONTROL SPENT- IN RESEARCH

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.766
CENTER. IN MANY MANY OTHER

00:50:02.833 --> 00:50:04.634
SCHOLARS HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:05.836
THIS STUDY AFTER STUDY AFTER

00:50:05.902 --> 00:50:07.571
STUDY. SHOWS A VERY STRONG

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:09.873
CORRELATION BETWEEN. THE AMOUNT

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.974
OF GUNS THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:11.842
GUNS IN THE COMMUNITY OR

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:18.482
HOUSEHOLD. AND THE LIKELIHOOD

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:19.082
OF GUN VIOLENCE. HANK YOU AND

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:19.683
I AND I WOULD LIKE. IF I CAN

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.951
GET SOME. GET SOMEBODY FOR. OF

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.552
THE FACT THAT WE- DON'T HAVE

00:50:22.619 --> 00:50:25.021
IT. ACCUMULATED I THINK IT'S A

00:50:25.088 --> 00:50:26.957
LITTLE SHOCKING ESPECIALLY AS-

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:27.924
WE'RE MOVING FORWARD ON PUBLIC

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:29.893
POLICY. THAT DEALS WITH A

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.827
CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.296
RIGHT. THAT IF WE ARE FLYING

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.565
BLIND BLIND OR ANECDOTALLY.

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:39.069
THAT WE PAUSE. AND IN THE

00:50:39.136 --> 00:50:40.837
INTEREST OF GOOD PUBLIC POLICY

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:43.473
ACCUMULATE SS. AND DISCUSS

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.275
THESE ISSUES. ON THE MERITS

00:50:45.342 --> 00:50:47.277
BASED ON THE METRICS- I THINK

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:48.912
THAT WOULD BE FOR. A MUCH

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:52.215
STRONGER. NON REFLEXIVE TYPE OF

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:54.384
PUBLIC POLICY. AND I KNOW THAT

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:56.253
YOU WERE A CAR LOT PROFESSOR

00:50:56.319 --> 00:50:57.287
FELLOW PROFESSOR SO I WOULD

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:59.322
JUST POINT OUT TO YOU. THAT THE

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.224
SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTS AN

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.492
INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS

00:51:02.559 --> 00:51:04.227
AND THAT WITH THE DECISION WAS

00:51:04.294 --> 00:51:06.630
DECIDED IN HELLER RECENTLY- BYE

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:07.864
THAT DOES NOT GO TO THE STATES

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.232
AND COURTS THE TENTH AMENDMENT

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:10.801
RESERVES A SIGNIFICANT POWERS

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.636
TO THE STATES. I BELIEVE THIS

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.838
BILL IS A 100% CONSISTENT AND

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:15.772
CONSTANT WITH THE SECOND

00:51:15.839 --> 00:51:17.374
AMENDMENT I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:19.142
IN TEMPERATE TO CALL THIS.

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.410
CONSISTENT WITH THE SEGMENT

00:51:20.477 --> 00:51:21.878
RIGHTS I HAVE NOT HEARD ANY

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:23.914
ARGUMENT AS TO WHY THIS WOULD

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:24.714
BE AN INFRINGEMENT ON THE

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:26.116
SECOND AMENDMENT BECAUSE IT IS

00:51:26.183 --> 00:51:27.083
SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE STATE OF

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.819
CALIFORNIA. CAN DO WHATEVER IT

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:30.420
WANTS WITH ITS OWN PROPERTY AND

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:32.088
AGAIN GIVEN THE HIGH

00:51:32.155 --> 00:51:34.191
CORRELATION BETWEEN GUNS AND

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.193
GUN VIOLENCE. I THINK IT'S VERY

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:36.993
CLEAR THAT THIS IS GOOD PUBLIC

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.662
POLICY BECAUSE THE STATE SHOULD

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.363
NOT BE PROFITING FOR EVERY

00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.931
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR GUN

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.833
SHOW. WE'RE PROBABLY INCREASING

00:51:42.899 --> 00:51:44.367
SIGNIFICANTLY THE LIKELIHOOD OF

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:45.969
SIGNIFICANT COSTNER'S CASA

00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:46.937
GRANDE BY ONCE IN THE STATE ARE

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:51.408
MUCH HIGHER. THAN A TINY. BIT

00:51:51.475 --> 00:51:52.042
OF REVENUE THAT WE'RE RECEIVING

00:51:52.108 --> 00:51:56.379
FROM GUNSHIPS. SENATOR COULD.

00:51:56.446 --> 00:51:59.282
THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT- ARISING

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:06.122
REASON FOR MY SUPPORT- IN THE I

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.291
WANTED TO- GO OUT OF MY WAY TO

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:10.727

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:14.130
BOAT- WITH ANY INDICTMENT ON

00:52:15.665 --> 00:52:17.400
WOULD OCCUR IN FAIRGROUNDS OR

00:52:17.467 --> 00:52:20.570
OTHER STATE- PROPERTIES- I WANT

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.272

VILIFICATION OF LEGAL VENDORS

FIREARMS OR HAVE THROUGH AT

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:29.846
FAIR GROUNDS OR THERE'S THE

00:52:29.913 --> 00:52:33.116
PROPERTIES- AND I THINK- TO

00:52:33.183 --> 00:52:35.185
SOME EXTENT THE OPPOSITION. IN

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:37.354
THE ANALYSIS IS POINTED OUT IN

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:39.122
RIGHTFULLY SO THAT YOU CAN

00:52:39.189 --> 00:52:41.291
ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA REGULATION

00:52:41.358 --> 00:52:44.961
OF THESE GUN SHOWS WITH A

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:46.329
NATIONAL STATISTICS BECAUSE

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:48.098
HERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:50.867
TREMENDOUS JOB OF MAKING SURE

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.002
THAT BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE IN

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:54.905
PLACE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUN

00:52:54.971 --> 00:52:57.274

SUPPORTING THE BILL I'M

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:04.881
SUPPORTING THE BILL BECAUSE I

00:53:04.948 --> 00:53:07.484
DON'T THINK. THAT IT'S

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:09.986
NECESSARY OR PROPER FIRST AID

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:24.768

INCREASED AT A KEY FACTOR FOR

02:18:55.960 --> 02:18:57.595

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.255

02:19:24.322 --> 02:19:26.357
CONSIDER WAGE THEFT JUST THE

TRANSITORY AS CONSTRUCTION

WHICH IS WHY WE MUST PUSH A

03:34:41.034 --> 03:34:43.370
THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND IF YOU

03:34:43.437 --> 03:34:44.871
WANT TO TALK ABOUT RAPE I THINK

03:34:44.938 --> 03:34:46.173
IT'S A DIFFERENT SUBJECT AND

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:50.644
TALKING ABOUT. HOW WE CAN FIX

03:34:50.711 --> 03:34:51.211
THAT SITUATION BUT MEMBERS I

03:34:51.278 --> 03:34:51.912
WOULD ASK YOU. TO THINK A

03:34:51.979 --> 03:34:53.847
LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT

03:34:53.914 --> 03:34:56.083
ZONE. THINK ABOUT THESE. MEN

03:34:56.149 --> 03:34:57.150
AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED OUR

03:34:57.217 --> 03:34:58.952
COUNTRY. AND THIS MIGHT BE A

03:34:59.019 --> 03:35:00.887
SMALL STEP IN HELPING THEM TO

03:35:00.954 --> 03:35:02.823
REGAIN THEIR LIVES AS THEY HAVE

03:35:02.889 --> 03:35:03.957
FOUGHT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN LIVE

03:35:04.024 --> 03:35:05.626
OUR LIVES I RESPECTFULLY ASK

03:35:05.692 --> 03:35:06.727
FOR AND I HAVE A- SENATOR

03:35:06.793 --> 03:35:12.966
BURGESS. I THINK

03:35:13.033 --> 03:35:17.537
DECRIMINALIZATION LAW. IS TIED

03:35:17.604 --> 03:35:19.539
TO THE RECORD SHOULD BE TIED TO

03:35:19.606 --> 03:35:22.442
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF PERSONS

03:35:22.509 --> 03:35:24.344
MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THIS BILL

03:35:24.411 --> 03:35:26.146
CURRENTLY PROPOSES THE CREATION

03:35:26.213 --> 03:35:28.548
OF A TASK FORCE. I WOULD FEEL

03:35:28.615 --> 03:35:30.917
FAR MORE COMFORTABLE EVALUATING

03:35:30.984 --> 03:35:33.420
THE MERITS. OF POTENTIAL

03:35:33.487 --> 03:35:35.522
DECRIMINALIZATION IF THERE WAS

03:35:35.589 --> 03:35:37.491
A TASK FORCE THAT. I HAD

03:35:37.557 --> 03:35:39.493
ALREADY BEEN FORMED IN PUT

03:35:39.559 --> 03:35:41.228
FORWARD THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS.

03:35:41.295 --> 03:35:43.063
SO I THINK THIS I SLIGHTLY YOU

03:35:43.130 --> 03:35:45.065
KNOW THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE

03:35:45.132 --> 03:35:47.234
SCENARIO AND I THINK BECAUSE OF

03:35:47.301 --> 03:35:49.336
THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED

03:35:49.403 --> 03:35:50.237
AS A MATTER OF POLICY AND

03:35:50.304 --> 03:35:52.472
PROCEDURE. TO LISTEN TO FOLKS

03:35:52.539 --> 03:35:54.207
PRIOR TO MAKING A DEAL

03:35:54.274 --> 03:35:55.842
CRIMINALIZATION BILL. THE

03:35:55.909 --> 03:35:57.144
SECOND ISSUE I THINK I HAVE

03:35:57.210 --> 03:36:00.047
WITH THIS IS THE SOCIAL SHARING.

03:36:00.113 --> 03:36:02.082
NOW WE'VE HEARD FROM- FROM

03:36:02.149 --> 03:36:04.251
FOLKS WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE ON.

03:36:04.318 --> 03:36:06.853
HOW THIS COULD BE BENEFICIAL-

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:08.889
TO FOLKS OF SUFFERING FROM

03:36:08.955 --> 03:36:11.158
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.

03:36:11.224 --> 03:36:12.559
BUT CAN'T THAT TYPE OF

03:36:12.626 --> 03:36:14.394
TREATMENT BE ACHIEVED THROUGH

03:36:14.461 --> 03:36:17.464
CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE- A

03:36:17.531 --> 03:36:20.133
PRESCRIPTION. BUY IN NOT THE

03:36:20.200 --> 03:36:22.202
DECRIMINALIZATION OF THAT. BUT

03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:23.904
THE IDEA OF SOCIAL SHARING GOES

03:36:23.970 --> 03:36:26.206
AGAINST THAT NOTION THAT YOU

03:36:26.273 --> 03:36:28.475
SHOULD BE SURGICAL IN TARGETED

03:36:28.542 --> 03:36:30.811
TO THOSE MOST NEEDING AT THAT

03:36:30.877 --> 03:36:32.979
SOCIAL SHARING COMPONENT TURNS

03:36:33.046 --> 03:36:34.348
THIS INTO A RECREATIONAL

03:36:34.414 --> 03:36:36.450
DECRIMINALIZATION. SO I THINK

03:36:36.516 --> 03:36:38.485
FOR THOSE TWO REASONS- I WON'T

03:36:38.552 --> 03:36:39.419
BE IN A POSITION TO SUPPORT

03:36:39.486 --> 03:36:40.987
THIS AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

03:36:41.054 --> 03:36:43.590
AUTHOR WHO. DOES GREAT HOMEWORK

03:36:43.657 --> 03:36:45.559
ON HIS BILLS THAT MAYBE

03:36:45.625 --> 03:36:47.427
SOMETHING LIKE THIS COME BACK

03:36:47.494 --> 03:36:49.896
AFTER TASK FORCES CREATED SO WE

03:36:49.963 --> 03:36:51.398
COULD HEAR WHAT THOSE

03:36:51.465 --> 03:36:52.432
PROFESSIONALS ARE TRULY

03:36:52.499 --> 03:36:55.669
RECOMMENDING RATHER THAN DOING

03:36:55.736 --> 03:36:56.970
IT IN THE REVERSE. SENATOR

03:36:57.037 --> 03:37:00.407

A CONSULTATION WITH BETTER NOW

03:37:20.260 --> 03:37:21.395
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN PERSUADED

03:37:21.461 --> 03:37:22.429
THAT THE PSYCHEDELIC THE

03:37:22.496 --> 03:37:24.097
PSYCHEDELIC THERAPIES OFFER

03:37:24.164 --> 03:37:24.931
POTENTIALLY BREAKTHROUGH

03:37:24.998 --> 03:37:26.233
BENEFITS TO CALIFORNIA'S

03:37:26.299 --> 03:37:27.667
VETERANS AND OTHERS SUFFERING

03:37:27.734 --> 03:37:29.736
FROM POST TRAUMATIC STRESS.

03:37:29.803 --> 03:37:31.037
PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY HAS

03:37:31.104 --> 03:37:32.272
RECENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO

03:37:32.339 --> 03:37:33.540
BE A PROMISING APPROACH FOR

03:37:33.607 --> 03:37:35.008
MANY VETERANS WHO ARE

03:37:35.075 --> 03:37:36.009
STRUGGLING WITH PERSISTENT

03:37:36.076 --> 03:37:37.944

CAUSED BY BATTLEFIELD TRAUMA

03:37:39.746 --> 03:37:41.481
AND LIFE CHANGING INJURIES.

03:37:41.548 --> 03:37:42.749
CURRENTLY INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING

03:37:42.816 --> 03:37:43.784
FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS TEND

03:37:43.850 --> 03:37:45.419
TO RESPOND POSITIVELY TO

03:37:45.485 --> 03:37:46.753
CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES ONLY

03:37:46.820 --> 03:37:49.556
ABOUT 50% OF THE TIME AT BEST

03:37:49.623 --> 03:37:50.257
WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH

03:37:50.323 --> 03:37:51.625
PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING OR

03:37:51.691 --> 03:37:53.293
MEDICATIONS. OR SOME

03:37:53.360 --> 03:37:56.430
COMBINATION THEREOF HAVE IS OF

03:37:56.496 --> 03:37:58.298
COURSE BETTER THAN NOTHING- BUT

03:37:58.365 --> 03:37:59.199
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO ADORE

03:37:59.266 --> 03:38:01.368
TRAUMA. IN THEIR SERVICE TO OUR

03:38:01.435 --> 03:38:02.869
NATION NEARLY HALF IS STILL

03:38:02.936 --> 03:38:05.338
CLEARLY INSUFFICIENT. IN RECENT

03:38:05.405 --> 03:38:07.340
YEARS VETERAN SUICIDE RATES

03:38:07.407 --> 03:38:08.542
HAVE STEADILY RISEN AS THE

03:38:08.608 --> 03:38:09.709
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THIS

03:38:09.776 --> 03:38:11.812
COUNTRY HAS CONTINUED TO WORSEN

03:38:11.878 --> 03:38:13.213
AT THIS POINT MANY VETERANS OF

03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:14.848
OUR MOST RECENT WARS. HAVE

03:38:14.915 --> 03:38:16.016
ACTUALLY LOST MORE OF THEIR

FELLOW SERVICE MEMBERS TO

SUICIDE IN TWO DEPLOYMENTS WITH

03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:21.354
FAIRLY CLEAR AT THIS POINT THE

03:38:21.421 --> 03:38:22.689
CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO THE

03:38:22.756 --> 03:38:23.457
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT OF OUR

03:38:23.523 --> 03:38:25.926
VETS. ARE NOT SATISFACTORY AND

03:38:25.992 --> 03:38:27.461
REQUIRES SOME LEVEL OF

03:38:27.527 --> 03:38:29.863
INNOVATION CREATIVITY AND OPEN

03:38:29.930 --> 03:38:32.666

03:38:36.603 --> 03:38:37.504
RESULT OF EVIDENCE BASED

03:39:54.514 --> 03:39:56.283
BILL OUT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

03:39:56.349 --> 03:39:58.184
OF MANY DECADES AGO AND PERHAPS

03:39:58.251 --> 03:40:00.720
SOME OF YOU WHERE WE'RE MAYBE

03:40:00.787 --> 03:40:02.155
NOT EVEN ON THE PLANET YEAH BUT

03:40:02.222 --> 03:40:04.157
I WAS A SOCIAL CASE WORKER IN

03:40:04.224 --> 03:40:05.959
INTAKE SUPERVISOR IN THE

03:40:06.026 --> 03:40:08.361
SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES AT THE

03:40:08.428 --> 03:40:10.163
TIME THAT LSD BECAME OUT OF THE

03:40:10.230 --> 03:40:12.999
GO TO DRUG FOR SOCIAL SHARING I

03:40:13.066 --> 03:40:14.200
THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE

03:40:14.267 --> 03:40:15.569
NAME TIMOTHY LEARY WHO WAS

03:40:15.635 --> 03:40:17.704
CONSIDERED THE GURU OF BEING

03:40:17.771 --> 03:40:20.106
ABLE TO. TAKE THIS SPECIFIC

03:40:20.173 --> 03:40:22.208
DRUG LSD AND FIND YOURSELF IN

03:40:22.275 --> 03:40:24.244
ANOTHER WORLD OUT OF BODY

03:40:24.311 --> 03:40:27.213
EXPERIENCES WELL MY CASELOAD AT

03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:29.382
THAT TIME- CONTINUED THE NUMBER%

03:40:29.449 --> 03:40:31.117
OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD TRIED

03:40:31.184 --> 03:40:32.719
TO- THAT EXPERIMENT THROUGH

03:40:32.786 --> 03:40:35.188
SOCIAL SHARING I BRING FORWARD

03:40:35.255 --> 03:40:37.591
AND IT WERE NOT ABLE TO RETURN

03:40:37.657 --> 03:40:38.658
TO THEIR BODY OR FROM THAT

03:40:38.725 --> 03:40:40.060
OTHER WORLD THAT THEY FOUND

03:40:40.126 --> 03:40:42.295
THROUGH THAT JOB SO THEY BECAME

03:40:42.362 --> 03:40:45.799
A- TOTALLY INCAPACITATED OF MY

03:40:45.865 --> 03:40:46.967
CASELOAD WITH AID TO THE

03:40:47.033 --> 03:40:48.768
DISABLED AT THAT TIME AND I HAD

03:40:48.835 --> 03:40:51.504
A NUMBER OF THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE

03:40:51.571 --> 03:40:52.105
WHO ARE PRACTICALLY MY AGE AT

03:40:52.172 --> 03:40:56.509
THAT TIME- BASICALLY HAD. NO

03:40:56.576 --> 03:40:58.845
FURTHER ON CAPACITY AND FOUND

03:40:58.912 --> 03:41:00.447
THEMSELVES IN ASSISTED LIVING

03:41:00.513 --> 03:41:01.848
OR WHAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR

03:41:01.915 --> 03:41:03.817
PEOPLE IN THAT AGE AT THAT TIME

03:41:03.883 --> 03:41:05.218
SO THE SOCIAL SHARING PART OF

03:41:05.285 --> 03:41:06.720
THIS DRUG IS VERY VERY

03:41:06.786 --> 03:41:08.688
CONCERNING AND I THINK WHEN

03:41:08.755 --> 03:41:09.122
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:41:09.189 --> 03:41:11.458
PSYCHEDELIC EXPERIENCES THAT

03:41:11.524 --> 03:41:13.093
WILL GO ON AT PARTIES SOCIAL

03:41:13.159 --> 03:41:15.895
SHARING R. AS COMPARED TO A

03:41:15.962 --> 03:41:17.430
THERAPEUTIC USE FOR OUR

03:41:17.497 --> 03:41:18.865
VETERANS THEY'RE QUITE

03:41:18.932 --> 03:41:20.867
DIFFERENT AND SHOULDN'T I DON'T

03:41:20.934 --> 03:41:22.535
BELIEVE BE CONTAINED IN A

03:41:22.602 --> 03:41:28.241
MEASURE LIKE THIS. IF WE WANT

03:41:28.308 --> 03:41:29.709
TO CONFINE IT. SPECIFY IT POURS

03:41:29.776 --> 03:41:31.811
THROUGH. USE OUR BAD. ARE I TA

03:41:31.878 --> 03:41:34.314
SUPPORT THAT BUT I DO BELIEVE

03:41:34.381 --> 03:41:35.915
THAT THIS STEP SWAY OVER THAT

03:41:35.982 --> 03:41:38.351
IN IN PROMOTING SOCIAL SHARING.

03:41:38.418 --> 03:41:39.686
OF THESE VERY VERY

03:41:39.753 --> 03:41:42.155
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTFUL DRUGS

03:41:42.222 --> 03:41:43.423
AND YOU NEED ONLY GO TO THE

03:41:43.490 --> 03:41:45.325
SCIENCE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE TO

03:41:47.227 --> 03:41:49.329
PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS ARE FINE AND

03:41:49.396 --> 03:41:51.131
CERTAINLY VERY YOUNG MINDS IN

03:41:51.197 --> 03:41:52.999
OFF HOPEFULLY IN TERMS OF THOSE

03:41:53.066 --> 03:41:55.635

03:41:55.702 --> 03:41:57.637
THOSE. PARTICULAR CONDITIONS

03:41:57.704 --> 03:41:58.638
IT'S QUITE A DIFFERENT

03:41:58.705 --> 03:42:00.674
EXPERIENCE ARE BASED ON FINANCE

03:42:00.740 --> 03:42:02.642
SO IT NEEDS TO BE SEPARATED AND

03:42:02.709 --> 03:42:04.010
I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY THE

03:42:04.077 --> 03:42:05.879
CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE. WE

03:42:05.945 --> 03:42:08.415

03:42:31.971 --> 03:42:33.773
MEDICATIONS THAT ARE SHOWING

03:42:33.840 --> 03:42:35.275
CONSIDERABLE PROMISE AND EVEN

03:42:35.341 --> 03:42:37.510
MORE THAN PROMISE AND HELPING

03:42:37.577 --> 03:42:39.546

MAX STRESS DISORDER AND

03:42:43.016 --> 03:42:46.419
DEPRESSION- AND BECAUSE OF

03:42:46.486 --> 03:42:48.154
CURRENT LAW WE ACTUALLY TELL

ON YOU- YOU ARE BREAKING THE

03:42:51.791 --> 03:42:54.194
LAW WHICH THEN FORCES PEOPLE

03:42:54.260 --> 03:42:54.794
THEY HAVE TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY

03:42:54.861 --> 03:42:56.863
IN ORDER TO GET TREATMENT- I

03:42:56.930 --> 03:42:59.833
THINK OUR- SO. I THINK BOTH ARE

03:42:59.899 --> 03:43:00.800
VETERANS OR ANYONE ELSE WHO

03:43:00.867 --> 03:43:03.103
SUFFERS FROM PTSD AND DESERVES

03:43:03.169 --> 03:43:05.505
BETTER AND SHOULD HAVE ACCESS

03:43:05.572 --> 03:43:08.141
TO THESE MEDICATIONS- AND SO

03:43:08.208 --> 03:43:10.210
WITH THAT HIGH- CAN I VOTE ON

PRESIDENT I JUST HAVE A FEW

03:43:14.781 --> 03:43:18.551
MORE- THINGS TO ADD M. A. N.

03:43:18.618 --> 03:43:21.121
YOU KNOW TO SAY THAT A

03:43:21.187 --> 03:43:25.091
PARTICULAR DRUG SHOWS PROMISE.

03:43:25.158 --> 03:43:26.226
PROBABLY SOUNDS ENCOURAGING TOO

03:43:26.292 --> 03:43:31.698
MANY. BUT IS IT GOOD POLICY TO

03:43:31.765 --> 03:43:33.366
MAKE THE DRUG LEGAL FOR

03:43:33.433 --> 03:43:35.568
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES ONE THAT

03:43:35.635 --> 03:43:37.270
YOU HAVE DECIDED JUST SHOWS

03:43:37.337 --> 03:43:41.508
PROMISE. IS THAT SAFE POLICY TO

03:43:41.574 --> 03:43:44.644
PUT INTO PLACE. VETERANS RIGHT

03:43:44.711 --> 03:43:46.246
NOW IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS

03:43:46.312 --> 03:43:49.649
BILL IS ABOUT. VETERANS RIGHT

03:43:49.716 --> 03:43:52.018
NOW HAVE ACCESS TO CARE TO MEAN

03:43:52.085 --> 03:43:56.122
THERAPY. WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE

03:43:56.189 --> 03:43:58.792
ACCESS TO IS OVER MEDICATING

03:43:58.858 --> 03:44:00.760
THEMSELVES WHICH WE KNOW IS

03:44:00.827 --> 03:44:03.463
COMMON IN THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM

03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:05.765
DEPRESSION AND SEVERE PTSD THEY

03:44:05.832 --> 03:44:07.333
WERE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEM

03:44:07.400 --> 03:44:09.569
TO OVER MEDICATE. THEMSELVES

03:44:09.636 --> 03:44:10.570
WITH A JOB LIKE THIS AND I

03:44:10.637 --> 03:44:12.839
THINK THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE

03:44:12.906 --> 03:44:14.507
EFFECT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

03:44:14.574 --> 03:44:17.010
WE WANT THOSE WHO HAVE SEVERE

03:44:17.076 --> 03:44:19.712
DEPRESSION. AND OTHER TRAUMA TO

BE ABLE TO GET BETTER WELL YOU

03:44:21.247 --> 03:44:22.215
CAN'T GET BETTER IF YOU ARE

03:44:22.282 --> 03:44:24.617
OVER MEDICATING YOURSELF. THIS

03:44:24.684 --> 03:44:26.452
IS AGAIN A SIGN FROM THE POINT

03:44:26.519 --> 03:44:27.787
THAT I MADE THAT YOU ARE

03:44:27.854 --> 03:44:29.556
PUTTING YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG

03:44:29.622 --> 03:44:33.359
GIRLS AT GREAT RISK. BY MAKING

03:44:33.426 --> 03:44:35.762
A DRUG LIKE THIS. LEGAL FOR

03:44:35.829 --> 03:44:37.397
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES NOT

03:44:37.463 --> 03:44:41.601
THERAPEUTIC. PURPOSES

03:44:41.668 --> 03:44:45.905
RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. SENATOR

03:44:45.972 --> 03:45:03.256

FIVE NINETEEN- AND JUST WANT TO

03:45:11.197 --> 03:45:12.765
REMIND FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW

03:45:12.832 --> 03:45:15.768
PSYCHEDELICS HAVE PLAYED A ROLE

03:45:15.835 --> 03:45:19.172
IN SO MANY CULTURES SINCE PRE

03:45:19.239 --> 03:45:23.676
HISTORY- THEY HELP THOSE WITH

03:45:23.743 --> 03:45:24.878
MENTAL ILLNESSES WITH

03:45:24.944 --> 03:45:26.512
DEPRESSION WITH ANXIETY WITH

03:45:26.579 --> 03:45:30.116
PTSD- AND THEY'VE ALSO HELPED

03:45:30.183 --> 03:45:33.119
HEALTHY PEOPLE TO. THEY OFFER

03:45:33.186 --> 03:45:35.021
NOT ONLY THERAPEUTIC BUT

03:45:35.088 --> 03:45:38.791
SPIRITUAL AND CREATIVE BENEFITS

03:45:38.858 --> 03:45:43.229
AS WELL. AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS

03:45:43.296 --> 03:45:48.268
BILL MENTIONED- THEY WERE.

03:45:48.334 --> 03:45:51.704
CRIMINALIZED AND IN FACT USED-

03:45:51.771 --> 03:45:56.276
AS A POLITICAL TOOL. IN FACT IN

03:45:56.342 --> 03:45:56.876
NINETEEN NINETY FOUR AND NIXON

03:45:56.943 --> 03:45:59.712
AIDE ADMITTED. THAT THE WAR ON

03:45:59.779 --> 03:46:01.915
DRUGS WAS A POLITICAL TOOL

03:46:01.981 --> 03:46:05.885
DESIGNED TO TARGET. BLACKS AND

03:46:05.952 --> 03:46:07.553
THOSE PROTESTING THE VIETNAM

03:46:07.620 --> 03:46:10.523
WAR. AND SAID THAT SINCE YOU

03:46:10.590 --> 03:46:12.158
COULD NOT MAKE BEING BLACK OR

03:46:12.225 --> 03:46:14.360
BEING A HIPPIE LEGAL. THEN YOU

03:46:14.427 --> 03:46:16.562
COULD MAKE THE DRUGS THAT THEY

03:46:16.629 --> 03:46:21.234
TOOK THE LEGAL. AS A RESULT THE

03:46:21.301 --> 03:46:23.069
TRIALS THAT WERE GOING ON IN

03:46:23.136 --> 03:46:24.570
THE FIFTIES AND THE SIXTIES

03:46:24.637 --> 03:46:28.708
ACTUALLY STOPPED BECAUSE OF.

03:46:28.775 --> 03:46:32.078
THIS MANUFACTURED WAR ON DRUGS.

03:46:32.145 --> 03:46:34.347
I THINK THIS BILL IS ABOUT

03:46:34.414 --> 03:46:37.517
PUBLIC HEALTH. RESEARCH

03:46:37.583 --> 03:46:39.485
AGGRESSIVE RESEARCH HAS STARTED

03:46:39.552 --> 03:46:44.991
BACK UP AGAIN. WHICH DOES SHOW.

03:46:45.058 --> 03:46:47.527
THAT THERE IS PROMISE FOR

03:46:47.593 --> 03:46:51.764
TREATMENT USING THESE DRUGS AND

03:46:51.831 --> 03:46:53.866
AVALON AS WE HAVE SEEN JUST

03:46:53.933 --> 03:46:56.269
WITH LAST YEAR I THINK MANY OF

03:46:56.336 --> 03:46:58.604
US ARE MANY FOLKS MANY

03:46:58.671 --> 03:47:00.873
AMERICANS ACTUALLY- PUTTHEIR

03:47:00.940 --> 03:47:03.009
FAITH IN THE PROMISE. OF A

03:47:03.076 --> 03:47:08.348
VACCINE. THAT IS MEDICATION.

03:47:08.414 --> 03:47:10.083
THAT DID NOT GO THROUGH WHAT

03:47:10.149 --> 03:47:13.152
THE NORMAL LONGER CHANNELS OF

03:47:13.219 --> 03:47:14.754
RESEARCH AND TESTING WOULD

03:47:14.821 --> 03:47:18.725
REQUIRE. BECAUSE THEY SHOWED

03:47:18.791 --> 03:47:21.060
ENOUGH PROMISE TO ACCELERATE. I

03:47:21.127 --> 03:47:22.729
JUST WANT TO ALSO ADD THAT YOU

03:47:22.795 --> 03:47:27.266
KNOW. GREAT BUSY LEGAL NO

03:47:27.333 --> 03:47:29.469
MATTER IF YOU ARE USING DRUGS

03:47:29.535 --> 03:47:32.338
SOME KIND OF. SUBSTANCE OR

03:47:32.405 --> 03:47:36.042
FORCE. AND THIS IS NOT ABOUT

03:47:36.109 --> 03:47:39.812
DECRIMINALIZING ERRANT BEHAVIOR.

03:47:39.879 --> 03:47:42.215
IT'S ABOUT DECRIMINALIZING THE

03:47:42.281 --> 03:47:45.985
USE OF CERTAIN PSYCHEDELICS.

03:47:46.052 --> 03:47:46.552
THAT HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE

03:47:46.619 --> 03:47:50.089
USEFUL. FOR MANY FOLKS WHO NEED

03:47:50.156 --> 03:47:53.659
THEM. AND THIS ALSO SHOULD NOT

03:47:53.726 --> 03:47:56.095
BE ABOUT JUDGMENT OFTEN TIMES

03:47:56.162 --> 03:47:57.363
WE WANT TO PLACE OUR OWN

03:47:57.430 --> 03:47:59.232
PERSONAL JUDGMENT OR OUR OWN

03:47:59.298 --> 03:48:02.268
PERSONAL EXPERIENCES. ON TO

03:48:02.335 --> 03:48:03.736
OTHER FOLKS WITHOUT REALLY

03:48:03.803 --> 03:48:05.338
UNDERSTANDING THEIR OWN MENTAL

03:48:05.405 --> 03:48:10.410
HEALTH. THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS.

03:48:10.476 --> 03:48:12.078
AND THEIR ABILITY TO HAVE

03:48:12.145 --> 03:48:14.514
CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES AND

03:48:14.580 --> 03:48:15.948
THE MEDICAL DECISIONS THAT THEY

03:48:16.015 --> 03:48:18.985
WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE AND I

03:48:19.052 --> 03:48:19.585
WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD THINK

03:48:19.652 --> 03:48:21.954
ABOUT THIS. IN THE SPACE OF

03:48:22.021 --> 03:48:24.724
PUBLIC HEALTH. RATHER THAN IN

03:48:24.791 --> 03:48:26.726
THE SPACE OF CRIMINALIZATION

03:48:26.793 --> 03:48:31.464
AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON SP

03:48:31.531 --> 03:48:32.732
FIVE NINETEEN. SEEING NO

03:48:32.799 --> 03:48:35.234
FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

03:48:35.301 --> 03:48:36.035

04:27:43.347 --> 04:27:45.582
SUSTAINABLE MODEL FOR THEM. AND

04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:46.850

INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ARE

04:28:36.700 --> 04:28:39.136
MAKING MORE AT THE MINIMUM WAGE

FOR MORE AND THAT'S VERY

04:28:40.170 --> 04:28:41.805
IMPORTANT BUT THEREARE

04:28:41.872 --> 04:28:43.640
INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE AT OUR

04:28:43.707 --> 04:28:45.008
BAKERSFIELD ASSOCIATION ARE

BIGGER SO ARC EMPLOYEES PEOPLE-

04:28:47.744 --> 04:28:50.481
IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS. AND

04:28:50.547 --> 04:28:52.983
SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT

THREE PRODUCTS A DAY WHEN THEY

04:29:06.497 --> 04:29:09.500
DO THIS PROCESS BUT THE DIGNITY

04:29:09.566 --> 04:29:10.801
OF BEING ABLE TO GO TO WORK

04:29:10.868 --> 04:29:12.135
EVEN IF YOU'RE ONLY BAGGING

04:29:12.202 --> 04:29:14.137
THREE PRODUCTS A DAY OR A SIT

04:29:14.204 --> 04:29:15.172
ASSEMBLING THREE BAGS TO BE

04:29:15.239 --> 04:29:17.107
DISTRIBUTED. WHEN I SAY BAGS OF

04:29:17.174 --> 04:29:20.611
STUFF THAT GOES INTO THE PRISON

04:29:20.677 --> 04:29:21.211
SYSTEM AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

COME FRESH- TOOTHPASTE SOAP.

04:29:24.615 --> 04:29:26.517
THE INDIVIDUALS WITH THE SEVERE

04:29:26.583 --> 04:29:27.851
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES ARE

04:29:27.918 --> 04:29:28.685
GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT ARE

04:29:28.752 --> 04:29:30.621
HURT. WHEN YOU GO TALK TO THESE

04:29:30.687 --> 04:29:32.189
PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THE FACT THAT

04:29:32.256 --> 04:29:34.825
THE BAG ONLY THREE THREE PUT

04:29:34.892 --> 04:29:36.393
TOGETHER THREE PACKAGES A DAY.

04:29:36.460 --> 04:29:37.828
IT'S THE FACT THAT THEY CARRY

04:29:37.895 --> 04:29:38.395
THEIR LUNCH PAIL AD THEY'VE

04:29:38.462 --> 04:29:40.831
GOT A JOB AND- THEY TAKE PRIDE

04:29:40.898 --> 04:29:42.299
IN THAT JOB IT MAY TAKE THEM

04:29:42.366 --> 04:29:44.301
SEVERAL HOURS TO PUT THOSE

04:29:44.368 --> 04:29:46.503
SMALL PACKAGES TOGETHER- BUT I

04:29:46.570 --> 04:29:49.840
JUST SEE THAT. WITH THIS BILL-

04:29:49.907 --> 04:29:51.174
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FIX IT

04:29:51.241 --> 04:29:52.309
I MEAN I DON'T I DON'T EVEN

04:29:52.376 --> 04:29:53.410
HAVE A SOLUTION I DON'T KNOW IF

04:29:53.477 --> 04:29:54.912
YOU. GAUGE IT ON SOMEBODY'S

04:29:54.978 --> 04:29:57.047
DISABILITY- THOSE ARE SEVERELY

04:29:57.114 --> 04:29:58.582
IMPAIRED WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO

04:29:58.649 --> 04:29:59.750
WORK IN THE SHELTERED WORKSHOPS

04:29:59.816 --> 04:30:02.052
AND- AND BE PAID IN ORDER TO

04:30:02.119 --> 04:30:03.120
HAVE THAT DIGNITY OF HAVING A

04:30:03.186 --> 04:30:04.521
JOB WITH THOSE THAT ARE. YOU

04:30:04.588 --> 04:30:06.089
KNOW MORE QUALIFIED OR OR LESS

04:30:06.156 --> 04:30:07.558
DISABLED I'M NOT SURE HOW YOU

04:30:07.624 --> 04:30:09.092
EVEN WORD IT. BECAUSE IT'S A

04:30:09.159 --> 04:30:12.229
VERY TOUGH K- AREA TO WORK IN.

04:30:12.296 --> 04:30:13.730
AND I SEE YOUR HEART ON THE

04:30:13.797 --> 04:30:15.165
LEGISLATION AND THEY SHOULD BE

04:30:15.232 --> 04:30:15.966
PAID MORE THAN YOU KNOW MINIMUM

04:30:16.033 --> 04:30:17.801
WAGE- BUT- BUT I JUST DON'T SEE

04:30:17.868 --> 04:30:19.670
EMPLOYERS. I DON'T SEE

04:30:19.736 --> 04:30:21.204
EMPLOYERS OR INDIVIDUALS HIRING

04:30:21.271 --> 04:30:23.206
INDIVIDUALS TO DO. A JOB THAT

04:30:23.273 --> 04:30:24.808
WOULD TAKE SOMEONE ALL DAY TO

04:30:24.875 --> 04:30:25.542
DO IT BECAUSE OF THEIR

04:30:25.609 --> 04:30:26.843
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY. AND

04:30:26.910 --> 04:30:28.645
THEN NOT HAVING THAT. THAT

04:30:28.712 --> 04:30:31.715
PRIDE OF HAVING A JOB I HAVE A-

04:30:31.782 --> 04:30:33.317
INDIVIDUAL SEVERELY DISABLED.

04:30:33.383 --> 04:30:35.819
RUN DOWN SYNDROME SEVERELY DOWN

04:30:35.886 --> 04:30:38.021
SYNDROME. YOUNG MAN HE'S TWENTY

04:30:38.088 --> 04:30:39.323
THREE YEARS OLD AND HE CARRIES

04:30:39.389 --> 04:30:41.058
HIS LUNCH BAG HIS BAIL HIS

04:30:41.124 --> 04:30:42.960
LUNCH PAIL. LIKE HIS DAD EVERY

04:30:43.026 --> 04:30:45.329
DAY TO WORK. AND HE'S ONE OF

04:30:45.395 --> 04:30:47.130
THE LOWEST PERFORMERS IN THAT

04:30:47.197 --> 04:30:49.199
DRIVE. BUT THE IDEA THAT HE HAS

04:30:49.266 --> 04:30:50.467
A JOB AND HE GETS A LUNCH

04:30:50.534 --> 04:30:52.169
BREAK. AND HE TALKS TO HIS

04:30:52.235 --> 04:30:53.804
COLLEAGUES AND HE HAS A LIFE

04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:56.373
OTHER THAN BEING AT HOME- I

04:30:56.440 --> 04:30:58.375
THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR HIM.

04:30:58.442 --> 04:30:59.743
BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD

04:30:59.810 --> 04:31:01.044
BE SOMEBODY THAT WOULD LOSE HIS

04:31:01.111 --> 04:31:02.546
JOB HIS NAME IS GARRETT. AND I

04:31:02.613 --> 04:31:03.580
BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD BE

04:31:03.647 --> 04:31:04.414
SOMEBODY THAT WOULD LOSE HIS

04:31:04.481 --> 04:31:05.649
JOB BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY THAT

04:31:05.716 --> 04:31:07.184
SOMEBODY WOULD PAY MINIMUM WAGE

04:31:07.250 --> 04:31:08.051
TO DO THE WORK PRODUCT THAT HE

04:31:08.118 --> 04:31:10.621
DOES- AND I JUST THINK THAT

04:31:10.687 --> 04:31:12.089
LIKE I SAID YOUR HEART IS RIGHT

04:31:12.155 --> 04:31:13.924
MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES.

04:31:13.991 --> 04:31:14.791
BUT I HAVE A GRAVE CONCERN

04:31:14.858 --> 04:31:16.126
ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD LOSE

04:31:16.193 --> 04:31:18.028
THEIR JOB AND THEIR DIGNITY.

04:31:18.095 --> 04:31:21.498
BECAUSE. THEY COULDN'T FULFILL

04:31:21.565 --> 04:31:22.032
THE OBLIGATIONS OF WITH A

04:31:22.099 --> 04:31:22.599
MINIMUM WAGE EARNER WOULD-

04:31:22.666 --> 04:31:25.902
BECAUSE- TO DO. SENATOR LEYVA.

04:31:25.969 --> 04:31:26.970
THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I

04:31:27.037 --> 04:31:28.505
JUST HAVE TO STAND IN STRONG

04:31:28.572 --> 04:31:30.741
SUPPORT I LOVE THIS BILL- WHEN

04:31:30.807 --> 04:31:32.743
I WAS FIRST ELECTED I TOURED A

04:31:32.809 --> 04:31:34.144
COUPLE FACILITIES IN MY

04:31:34.211 --> 04:31:36.246
DISTRICT WITH A DEVELOPMENTALLY

04:31:36.313 --> 04:31:38.181
DISABLED FOLKS WHO WERE WORKING

04:31:38.248 --> 04:31:40.450
AND WE'RE SO EXCITED AS MY

04:31:40.517 --> 04:31:42.252
COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD SAYS

04:31:42.319 --> 04:31:43.320
THEY WERE SO EXCITED TO BE

04:31:43.387 --> 04:31:45.489
WORKING AND BEING PRODUCTIVE

04:31:45.555 --> 04:31:47.024
AND AS WE WERE WALKING THROUGH

04:31:47.090 --> 04:31:48.291
A SATELLITE WILL HOW MUCH DO

04:31:48.358 --> 04:31:49.893
THEY MAKE IT AND SOME ARE MADE

04:31:49.960 --> 04:31:52.195
LIKE TWO DOLLARS SO MAYBE LIKE

04:31:52.262 --> 04:31:54.364
THREE DOLLARS AND I SAID. DID I

04:31:54.431 --> 04:31:56.066
HEAR YOU. AND I JUST THOUGHT

04:31:56.133 --> 04:31:58.235
THAT THAT WAS APPALLING THESE

04:31:58.301 --> 04:31:59.503
FOLKS WHO ARE COMING TO WORK

04:31:59.569 --> 04:32:01.304
AND ARE EXCITED TO COME TO

04:32:01.371 --> 04:32:02.506
WORK. THAT WE COULD BE ALLOWED

04:32:02.572 --> 04:32:04.207
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM I

04:32:04.274 --> 04:32:05.909
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE COULD BE

04:32:05.976 --> 04:32:07.811
SOME CONFLICT OR SOME. OTHER

04:32:07.878 --> 04:32:09.413
PROBLEM BECAUSE MAYBE THEY

04:32:09.479 --> 04:32:10.981
DON'T PRODUCE AS MUCH SOME

04:32:11.048 --> 04:32:12.716
GROUPS OF PEOPLE. BUT YOU DON'T

04:32:12.783 --> 04:32:14.451
LET'S NOT JUST SAY NO WHAT'S UP

04:32:14.518 --> 04:32:15.419
WITH THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH

04:32:15.485 --> 04:32:17.087
WATER LET'S FIND A WAY TO MAKE

04:32:17.154 --> 04:32:18.455
IT WORK MAYBE THERE'S A SUBSIDY

04:32:18.522 --> 04:32:19.690
THAT CAN BE PUT IN FOR THAT

04:32:19.756 --> 04:32:21.992
THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY. ALL

04:32:22.059 --> 04:32:23.894
WORK HAS VALUE AND BECAUSE

04:32:23.960 --> 04:32:25.429
YOU'RE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN

04:32:25.495 --> 04:32:27.264
SOMEONE ELSE. I THINK IT'S

04:32:27.330 --> 04:32:29.266
REALLY INSULTING TO SAY THAT

04:32:29.332 --> 04:32:31.001
YOU DON'T EVEN DESERVE MINIMUM

04:32:31.068 --> 04:32:32.769
WAGE I PERSONALLY THINK THAT WE

04:32:32.836 --> 04:32:34.037
ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE

04:32:34.104 --> 04:32:35.806
FOLKS. BECAUSE THEY ARE

04:32:35.872 --> 04:32:38.208
MENTALLY DISABLED SO I STRONGLY

04:32:38.275 --> 04:32:39.976
STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND

04:32:40.043 --> 04:32:41.578
FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT

04:32:41.645 --> 04:32:42.913
BUSINESSES BEING PUT OUT OF

04:32:42.979 --> 04:32:44.381
BUSINESS OR WHATNOT I THINK

04:32:44.448 --> 04:32:46.216
THAT'S A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF

04:32:46.283 --> 04:32:47.217
THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE TALKING

04:32:47.284 --> 04:32:49.186
ABOUT. AND LET'S FIND A WAY TO

04:32:49.252 --> 04:32:50.620
TAKE CARE OF THAT SO WE DON'T

04:32:50.687 --> 04:32:52.422
CONTINUE DISADVANTAGING THESE

04:32:52.489 --> 04:32:53.457
PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP AND

04:32:53.523 --> 04:32:54.791
WORKING HARD EVERY DAY AND

04:32:54.858 --> 04:32:55.726
WE'RE ASKING IS THAT THEY MAKE

04:32:55.792 --> 04:32:57.327
MINIMUM WAGE. SO I WANT TO

04:32:57.394 --> 04:32:58.395
THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING IT

04:32:58.462 --> 04:33:01.431
FORWARD AND I STRESS AND STRONG

04:33:01.498 --> 04:33:03.233
SUPPORT. IS THERE ANY FURTHER

04:33:03.300 --> 04:33:03.800
DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS

04:33:03.867 --> 04:33:07.337
ITEM. SINGMAN CENTER DRAWS SO

04:33:07.404 --> 04:33:09.539

VERY MUCH- AND I UNDERSTAND

04:33:12.542 --> 04:33:14.578
SOME OF THE ISSUES HAD THAT

04:33:14.644 --> 04:33:15.579
HAVE BEEN RAISED AND THAT'S

04:33:15.645 --> 04:33:18.615
BECAUSE FRANKLY AS A SOCIETY WE

04:33:18.682 --> 04:33:21.618
STILL HAVE A TUNEL BARRIERS

04:33:21.685 --> 04:33:23.353
BERRY IS A STILL EXIS FOR

04:33:23.420 --> 04:33:25.188
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND

04:33:25.255 --> 04:33:26.857
NOT LOOKING AT THEM WITH THE

04:33:26.923 --> 04:33:28.592
FULL HUMANITY THAT THEY

04:33:28.658 --> 04:33:30.527
REPRESENT AND THE FACT THAT

04:33:30.594 --> 04:33:32.863
THEY LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE CAN BE

04:33:32.929 --> 04:33:34.931
DIFFERENT FROM ONE ANOTHER JUST

04:33:34.998 --> 04:33:35.932
LIKE WE'RE DIFFERENT FROM ONE

04:33:35.999 --> 04:33:37.467
ANOTHER. THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

04:33:37.534 --> 04:33:40.303
RIGHT TO LOOK FOR WHAT IT KIND

04:33:40.370 --> 04:33:42.005

WANT JUST LIKE WE DO. AND AND I

04:33:46.143 --> 04:33:46.977
THINK THAT MORE AND MORE

04:33:47.043 --> 04:33:48.612

CONCENTRATION OF THE BOARD THE

04:55:09.892 --> 04:55:10.759
MAKEUP OF THE BOARD THE

04:55:10.826 --> 04:55:12.694
GOVERNANCE- WE'VE SEEN IN LOS

04:55:12.761 --> 04:55:15.364
ANGELES COUNTY THAT- SO OFTEN

04:55:15.431 --> 04:55:16.899
BOARDS ARE HEAVILY SKEWED

04:55:16.965 --> 04:55:18.934
TOWARDS. THE CITY OF LOS

04:55:19.001 --> 04:55:20.169
ANGELES IN THIS CASE I BELIEVE

04:55:20.235 --> 04:55:21.603
THEY'RE GONNA EIGHT

04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:22.871

04:55:24.273 --> 04:55:26.008
SUPERVISORS ON TOP OF THAT

04:55:26.075 --> 04:55:27.109
THAT'S MORE THAN HALF OF THE

04:55:27.176 --> 04:55:28.777
BOARD MAKE UP WOULD BE

04:55:28.844 --> 04:55:30.512
CONCENTRATED IN DOWNTOWN LA AND

04:55:30.579 --> 04:55:31.947
I JUST THINK LOS ANGELES COUNTY

04:55:32.014 --> 04:55:33.282
IS MADE UP OF EIGHTY EIGHT

04:55:33.348 --> 04:55:34.083

NOT SO LA CENTRIC. AND I DO

04:55:45.594 --> 04:55:47.763
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. WHEN

04:55:47.830 --> 04:55:49.098
YOU HAVE EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES

04:55:49.164 --> 04:55:50.599

ORGANIZATION DOMINATING SO MUCH

04:55:52.568 --> 04:55:53.869
I KNOW THE CITY OF LONG BEACH.

04:55:53.936 --> 04:55:55.370
HAS REPRESENTATION ON THE BOARD

04:55:55.437 --> 04:55:57.406

04:56:01.110 --> 04:56:02.878

04:56:07.616 --> 04:56:08.183

05:10:59.741 --> 05:11:02.310
PREVENTING THOSE EVENTS THAT

05:11:02.377 --> 05:11:04.746
MAY OCCUR IN THE FUTURE. SO IN

05:11:04.812 --> 05:11:06.247
ADDITION TO THE HOLOCAUST I

05:11:06.314 --> 05:11:07.448
BELIEVE THAT GENOCIDE

05:11:07.515 --> 05:11:12.387
CURRICULA- NEEDS TO- GIVE A

05:11:12.453 --> 05:11:15.056
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF- OF-

05:11:15.123 --> 05:11:17.125
MATERIAL- THROUGH THE SCHOOL

05:11:17.191 --> 05:11:19.127
SYSTEM THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE

05:11:19.193 --> 05:11:20.795
ARMENIAN GENOCIDE THE GREEK

05:11:20.862 --> 05:11:23.965
PONTIC GENOCIDE- CAMBODIAN

05:11:24.032 --> 05:11:25.500
THERE THE PROBLEM IS THE LIST

05:11:25.566 --> 05:11:26.868
IS LONG BUT I THINK IT'S

05:11:26.934 --> 05:11:29.203
ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE- THAT WE

05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:31.839
FORMALIZE- THIS TYPE OF

05:11:31.906 --> 05:11:35.510
EDUCATION IN- THE SCHOOL SYSTEM

05:11:35.576 --> 05:11:36.544
AND THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT

05:11:36.611 --> 05:11:38.913
DIRECTION. SO ONCE AGAIN THANK

05:11:38.980 --> 05:11:41.716

05:11:41.783 --> 05:11:42.984

LONG. THIS IS VERY LONG AND

05:12:01.102 --> 05:12:02.136
UNFORTUNATELY THE LIST COULD

05:12:02.203 --> 05:12:04.405
GET LONGER IF PEOPLE DON'T

05:12:04.472 --> 05:12:07.942

05:12:15.683 --> 05:12:17.652
SERIOUSNESS. OF WHAT HAPPENED

ALSO SEEN THIS AND HAVE BEEN

05:12:25.093 --> 05:12:26.527
APPALLED AT THE FACT THAT YOU

05:12:26.594 --> 05:12:30.164
HAVE A STORE OWNER DECIDES TO

05:12:30.231 --> 05:12:32.700
SELL YELLOW STARS- IT'S A WAY

05:12:32.767 --> 05:12:33.634
TO TRY TO MAKE A POLITICAL

05:12:33.701 --> 05:12:35.603
POINT ABOUT VACCINES NOT

05:12:35.670 --> 05:12:37.405
RECOGNIZING WHAT THAT REALLY

GENOCIDES AS WELL- IT IS

05:12:47.782 --> 05:12:50.218

05:12:53.488 --> 05:12:55.690

05:19:43.998 --> 05:19:45.799
AND IT'S REALLY IMPACTING OUR

05:19:45.866 --> 05:19:47.701
CITY'S EARLIEST CITIES JUST DID

05:19:47.768 --> 05:19:49.470
A STUDY RELEASED THIS YEAR

05:19:49.537 --> 05:19:51.171
FOUND THAT MORE THAN SEVEN OUT

05:19:51.238 --> 05:19:52.273
OF TEN CITIES ANTICIPATE

05:19:52.339 --> 05:19:53.574
INCREASING WASTE COLLECTION

05:19:53.641 --> 05:19:55.276
RATES BY AS MUCH AS TWENTY

05:19:55.342 --> 05:19:57.077
PERCENT. TO COVER THE COST OF

05:19:57.144 --> 05:19:58.479
MANAGING THE ADDITIONAL WAYS I

05:19:58.546 --> 05:20:00.180
KNOW THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO

05:20:00.247 --> 05:20:01.515
FOR EXAMPLE JUST RAISE THE

05:20:01.582 --> 05:20:04.618
RATES BY TEN DOLLARS. A MONTH-

05:20:04.685 --> 05:20:06.186
CONSUMERS MISTAKENLY BELIEVE

05:20:06.253 --> 05:20:07.655
THE CHASING EURO SYMBOL THE

05:20:07.721 --> 05:20:09.690
RECYCLING SYMBOL MEANS THAT

05:20:09.757 --> 05:20:11.892
THE- THAT THAT THAT THE PRODUCT

05:20:11.959 --> 05:20:14.562
IS RECYCLABLE- AND OF COURSE WE

05:20:14.628 --> 05:20:16.230
HAVE THE SYSTEM IF YOU LOOK AT

05:20:16.297 --> 05:20:17.598
ANY PLASTIC PRODUCTS AND

05:20:17.665 --> 05:20:18.933
THERE'S A- THIS RECYCLING

05:20:18.999 --> 05:20:20.367
SYMBOL IN THE MIDDLE IS A

05:20:20.434 --> 05:20:22.903
LITTLE NUMBER. AND IT BASICALLY

05:20:22.970 --> 05:20:25.172
IS A CODE FOR THE RESIN THAT IS

05:20:25.239 --> 05:20:28.809
USED. IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE

05:20:28.876 --> 05:20:30.010
PLASTIC. AND I CLASSIFIED THE

05:20:30.077 --> 05:20:31.745
PLASTIC TYPES FROM NUMBERS ONE

05:20:31.812 --> 05:20:32.947
THREE SEVEN. AND IT WAS

05:20:33.013 --> 05:20:34.381
DESIGNED AS A METHOD FOR WASTE

05:20:34.448 --> 05:20:35.449
FACILITIES TO PROPERLY SORT

05:20:35.516 --> 05:20:37.585
PLASTICS. NOT INTERESTINGLY AS

05:20:37.651 --> 05:20:39.119
A WAY TO SUGGEST. A

05:20:39.186 --> 05:20:41.021
RECYCLABILITY TO CONSUMERS GET

05:20:41.088 --> 05:20:42.423
AFTER THIRTY YEARS AND USE THE

05:20:42.489 --> 05:20:44.725
SYMBOL HAS. COME TO BE

05:20:44.792 --> 05:20:45.559
UNDERSTOOD AS THE RECYCLING

05:20:45.626 --> 05:20:47.861
SYMBOL IN FACT. SOMETIMES

05:20:47.928 --> 05:20:49.630
PRODUCT. PRODUCERS WILL JUST

05:20:49.697 --> 05:20:51.665
PUT THESE- THE RECYCLING SYMBOL

05:20:51.732 --> 05:20:53.000
ON THERE WITHOUT ANY NUMBER IN

05:20:53.067 --> 05:20:54.068
THE MIDDLE ND WHEN ASKED WHY

05:20:54.134 --> 05:20:54.969
DID YOU PUT IT ON THERE THOUGH

05:20:55.035 --> 05:20:56.403
SO WE JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE

05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:58.305
RECYCLING. IN GENERAL. EVEN

05:20:58.372 --> 05:21:00.174
THOUGH THERE THAT PARTICULAR

05:21:00.240 --> 05:21:00.641
PRODUCT IS NOT AT ALL

05:21:00.708 --> 05:21:03.410
RECYCLABLE SO. I LOOK AT IT WE

05:21:03.477 --> 05:21:05.145
DO RECYCLING IS COMPLICATED WE

05:21:05.212 --> 05:21:06.847
KNOW THAT IT'S CONFUSING THE

05:21:06.914 --> 05:21:07.514
CONSUMER BRANDS ASSOCIATION

05:21:07.581 --> 05:21:09.116
JUST DID A STUDY. THEY FOUND

05:21:09.183 --> 05:21:11.018
OUT THE RECYCLING RANKS AHEAD

05:21:11.085 --> 05:21:12.186
OF SOME OF THE MOST CONFUSING

05:21:12.252 --> 05:21:13.487
THINGS IN LIFE FOR MOST

05:21:13.554 --> 05:21:15.522
AMERICANS. IT'S MORE CONFUSING

05:21:15.589 --> 05:21:18.125
THAN BUILDING IKEA FURNITURE

05:21:18.192 --> 05:21:18.959
MORE CONFUSING THAN THAN DOING

05:21:19.026 --> 05:21:20.728
YOUR TAXES. PLAYING THE STOCK

05:21:20.794 --> 05:21:22.630
MARKET OR UNDERSTANDING YOUR

05:21:22.696 --> 05:21:25.733

CAUSE. CONTAMINATION SO OUR

05:21:42.249 --> 05:21:43.417
STATE AND FEDERAL LAW SAY THAT

05:21:43.484 --> 05:21:44.685
PRODUCERS CAN'T LIE TO

05:21:44.752 --> 05:21:45.753
CONSUMERS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

05:21:45.819 --> 05:21:47.454
