CENTER STATE IS ALSO USED BY STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR BUDGET ALLOCATIONS. AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY IN MY MIND AS A RESEARCHER. CENSUS DATA BASICALLY IS THE BASELINE DATA WE USE FOR THE DECADE. FOR NOT JUST THAT DECADE BUT FOR ALL TIME SO WHEN SOMEONE LOOKS BACK AT WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY THIRTY THEY'RE GOING TO USE THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS DATA. WHICH MEANS THAT ANYONE WHO ISN'T COUNTED IS ESSENTIALLY ERASED FROM HISTORY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR THAT CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY. IS COUNTED.

TWENTY FOUR SENATOR UMBERG MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE JOINT RESOLUTION TWO BY SENATOR UMBERG RELATIVE TO THE PRESIDENT'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARATION. YOU MAY PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES -- FIRST OF LET ME THANK MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA BARBARA IN CALLING FROM SAN DIEGO FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE IN THEIR IMPROVEMENT ON THIS RESOLUTION. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS. NOT ABOUT IT IS NOT ABOUT THE WALL PER SE I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME VERY STRONG FEELINGS. ON BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE. AND IT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT THE NATIONAL DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY -- THE PROPRIETY OF THAT IS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL BE DEBATED FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CAN AGREE UPON. WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC. IN THE UNITED STATES CONCERNING OPIOIDS THEIR ABUSE. AND THE CONSEQUENCES BEAR OF WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE PRESIDENT AND HIS EXPERTS. PUT TOGETHER A NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY THIS IS DATED JANUARY TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN IT IS WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S EXPERTS BELIEVE IS THE WAY TO ADDRESS. DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S VIEW AND IS EXPERTS AS TO THE WAY TO DEAL WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS NO WHERE. IN THIS STRATEGY NO WHERE IN THE PRESENT STRATEGY. DOES IT MENTION [inaudible] A WALL. WHAT DOES THE DOES TALK ABOUT IT TALKS ABOUT FENNEL AND IT TALKS ABOUT HEALTH FENNEL IS KILLING? TENS OF THOUSANDS. OF OUR CHILDREN OUR BROTHERS OR SISTERS OR WIVES OR HUSBANDS -- THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT. WHAT THE DIVERSION OF FUNDS DOES TO CALIFORNIA IN CALIFORNIANS? THIS RESOLUTION IS ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE ARE GOING TO NOT WE THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO DIVERT FUNDS FROM WHAT HE SAYS IS OUR NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL. POLICY AND STRATEGY. TO ANOTHER PURPOSE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO CALIFORNIA AND WHAT IT'S GONNA DO TO CALIFORNIANS IN TERMS OF MILITARY CONSTRUCTION. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT NECESSARY. PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE GOING TO BE AFFECTED. BY THIS DIVERSION OF FUNDS. FOR EXAMPLE THE NAVY SEAL RESERVE TRAINING FACILITY IN SAN DIEGO. IN MY OWN DISTRICT THE SEAL BEACH WEAPONS STATION. IN OUR OWN DISTRICT NEARBY DISTRICT NEARBY IS THE HANGER TRAVIS TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE MOST IMPORTANTLY [inaudible] ARE THE QUARTERS FOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN [inaudible] THAT ARE. DILAPIDATED HAVE LED INFESTATION. ALL THESE IMPORTANCE ALL THESE IMPORTANT PROJECTS AND USES. ARE GOING TO BE EITHER DELAYED OR PERHAPS NEVER COMPLETED BECAUSE THE MONEY IS GOING TO BE DIVERTED TO ANOTHER PURPOSE. SO IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT THE WALL IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT YOU MAY THINK ABOUT THIS NATIONAL EMERGENCY. WE CAN AGREE THAT THIS DIVERSION OF FUNDS IS GOING TO BE HARMFUL TO CALIFORNIAN CALIFORNIANS. AND I THINK WE CAN AGREE ALL OF US THAT WE SHOULD SEND A VERY STRONG MESSAGE. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE THAT THIS DIVERSION OF FUNDS IS ANTITHETICAL TO OUR HEALTH AND WELFARE WELL BEING ECONOMIC AND OTHERWISE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU BENCHER. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER WEST OF RIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SJ ARE. TO LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THIS WALL IS UNNECESSARY AND A COMPLETE. WASTE OF MONEY. MAKING AN ARGUMENT THAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD A WALL A WALL UNDER A TWO HUNDRED MILE WALL ON A TWO THOUSAND MILE BORDER. DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME I DON'T KNOW TO WHO. THAT MAKES SENSE. BUT THAT IF YOU DO THE MATH THAT LEAVES A THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED MILES [inaudible] OF WATER WITHOUT WALL WHAT HAPPENS THERE. BUT YOU KNOW. ONE OF THE THINGS THE PRESIDENT SAID IS THAT A WALL. THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN TESTED IN HISTORY WELL. EVERY SINGLE WALL. THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA. THE GREAT OF THE THE WALL OF JERUSALEM EVERY WALL. THAT IS EVER PROTECTED ANYTHING HAS ALWAYS [inaudible] FALLEN. AND EVERY WALL THAT THAT HAS FALLEN IN HISTORY. WAS NOT ONLY PENETRATED BUT IT WAS PENETRATED THROUGH. RIGOROUS DEFENSES OF PEOPLE THAT WERE DEFENDING THOSE WALLS WITH WITH CANNONS AND WEAPONS AND AN AND HUMAN POWER. THIS WALL WILL NOT HAVE THAT IT WILL BE JUST A BLANK. WALL IT WOULD BE A WALL THAT ANYBODY COULD SCALAR DIG UNDER CUT THROUGH. AND AND THIS IS JUST A UP. THE RESULT OF AN OF ABSURD PROP. UP PROMISE. THE PRESIDENT MADE THAT THE CONGRESS DID NOT HAVE THE COURAGE TO BLOCK. EVERYONE AGREES THIS IS A ABUSE OF POWER BUT THE CONGRESS JUST DID NOT HAVE THE BACKBONE. TO STAND UP AND DO THEIR JOB AND BE THE CONGRESS WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY THEY'RE APPROVAL APPROVAL RATING HAS GONE DOWN. 215% AMONG AMERICANS. CALIFORNIA WOULD BE DEEPLY HURT BY THIS ACTION IT'LL HURT. OUR DEFENSES IT'LL HURT VERY STRATEGIC. OF PROJECTS THAT WE WE NEED FOR OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. IT'LL GO BASICALLY INTO A HOLE IN THE GROUND THAT WILL NOT DO ANYTHING. WE NEED TO REDUCE FOR WAIT TIMES TO HELP INCREASE. OUR ECONOMY THAT REQUIRES AN INVESTMENT TO HELP. MOVE PEOPLE MORE EFFICIENTLY TO THE BORDER YET THE PRESIDENT'S IS MAKING A THREAT THAT HE'S GOING TO CLOSE THE BORDERS WHICH WILL HURT. CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY WHICH WILL COULD HURT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] THIS. A MONTH THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO FILED A LAWSUIT. AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THEIR HANDLING OF IMMIGRANTS. AND AND THEY ARE ALSO STRUGGLING WITH THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES ARE NOT ALWAYS HANDLED IMMIGRANTS. RESIDENT IS THREATENING TO CUT OFF AID TO CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES WHICH ARE ONLY EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM AND BRING MORE PEOPLE FLOCKING TO OUR BORDERS. THIS IS JUST A COMPLETE DISASTER AND HOW THIS PRESIDENT IS DEALING [inaudible] WITH. THE BORDER WITH OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH WITH OUR FRIENDLY NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH WITH CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST TRADING PARTNER MEXICO THIS IS HEARD IN OUR STATE. WE NEED TO SPEAK UP WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT I WANT TO COMMEND SENATOR -- BURKE FOR BRINGING THIS RESOLUTION FORWARD. FOR FOR SENDING A STRONG MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON. AND LETTING THEM KNOW WE SEND A HUNDRED AND TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN OUR CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS MONEY TO WASHINGTON AND ONLY GET ABOUT EIGHTY BILLION BACK IN SERVICES. WHAT WERE WERE? SUBSIDIZING THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THIS UNION. AND WE NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TELLING THIS PRESIDENT TELLING THIS CONGRESS TO STOP HURTING CALIFORNIA. YOU HEARD CALIFORNIA YOU HEARD THE NATION. AND AND WERE WERE FED UP. WHAT THESE POLICIES OF THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS CONGRESS AND HOW THEY'RE DEALING? WITH OUR OUR TRADING PARTNERS WITH. OUR OTHER PEOPLE OF OUR OWN COMMUNITY. WITH OF OUR TOURISM INDUSTRY WITH. OUR ENTIRE US SECURITY OF OUR NATION WERE FED UP. SO WE NEED TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE. FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO START STUDYING SOMETHING START READING SOMETHING START LEARNING ABOUT SOMETHING BUT BEFORE THEY START MAKING. VERY DESTRUCTIVE PAULA BUT IN. VERY DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES INTO PLACE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS DR. TO THE CLEARING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY IS NOT. INCONSEQUENTIAL. PAST PRESIDENTS HAVE DECLARED NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WERE BASED ON FACTS AN ACTUAL EMERGENCIES BUT MOST OF THEM DEALT WITH FOREIGN CRISES IN TAKING ACTIONS AGAINST NATIONAL ADVERSARIES. NOT RE DIRECT THE MONEY WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL. ONLY IN TWO OTHER INSTANCES HAVE EMERGENCY DECLARATIONS BEEN USED TO SPEND MONEY WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL ONCE BY GEORGE BUSH SENIOR IN NINETEEN NINETY DURING THE PERSIAN GULF WAR. AND THE OTHER BY GEORGE W. BUSH IN TWO THOUSAND ONE AFTER THE NINE ONE ONE ATTACKS. THE GOAL FOR THE NINE ONE ONE ATTACKS REQUIRE A MUCH DIFFERENT ACTION OF URGENCY BY OUR GOVERNMENT. THEN THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT OUR BORDER. THE FACTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ARGUMENT AGAINST THE DANGERS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER THEY SIMPLY DO NOT. THE DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY DIVERTED CRITICAL FUNDS AWAY FROM MILITARY SERVICES AND SUPPORT HERE IN OUR VERY OWN STATE. I AM CLEAR THAT WHAT WE DECIDE TO FUND IS A STATEMENT OF WHAT WE VALUE. THIS RESOLUTION DECLARES OUR VALUES AS A STATE AND STANDS UP FOR THE SEPARATION OF POWERS OUTLINED IN OUR US CONSTITUTION AGAIN I STAND THE STRONG SUPPORT OF FDR [inaudible] TO SENATOR BELL. ABOUT PRESIDENT MEMBERS I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION WHEN. WHEN WE -- HAD -- THE DISCUSSIONS SO ON SB ONE THE TRANSPORTATION MEASURE -- SIR WELL SO ARE CENTER FROM SAN DIEGO EXCUSE ME -- HAD -- MUCH DISCUSSIONS ABOUT -- TO THE BORDER CROSSINGS IN THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA. OF NEEDED -- TO HELP FINANCE THE BORDER CROSSINGS -- ALL ALONG THE BORDER AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN [inaudible] PUTTING -- FUNDS. INTO THE OUT. ALL ALONG THERE ARE THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT DRUG INTERDICTION AND THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAM THE BORDER CROSSINGS AND THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE IMPROVEMENT OF THOSE BORDER CROSSINGS. NOT ONLY HELPS TRADE WITH MEXICO BUT ALSO HELPS. WHERE IT'S -- THE STOPPING OF DRUGS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY BORDER WALL ACTUALLY DOES NOTHING TO DO THAT. SO I TOTALLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPARED. ON UPGRADING OUR AGING DEFENSE BILLS BILL TERRY INFRASTRUCTURE -- THE MONEY SHOULD -- COME BACK TO CALIFORNIA -- THE NINE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT IS BEEN TAKEN AWAY FROM THE HIGH SPEED RAIL -- PROJECT -- WE SHOULD HAVE A NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE -- PLAN. TO UPGRADE THE AGING -- INFRASTRUCTURE ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AS THE FALLING APART BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS INCREASED -- FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO THERE'S OTHER PRIORITIES OTHER THAN BUILDING A WALL. THAT WOULD HELP THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES. AND THOSE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THOSE PROJECTS IN THOSE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. RATHER THAN -- SOME MEANINGLESS SO -- POLITICAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECT -- I WOULD COMPARE -- TO SIMPLY BUILDING -- A PYRAMID OR A MONUMENT -- TO SOMEBODY BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS IS REALLY -- SOME KIND OF MONUMENT TO SOMEBODY AS OPPOSED TO SOMETHING THAT HELPS -- THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES LOW -- LET'S BE -- LET'S BE AWARE OF WHAT THIS REALLY -- BECAUSE THERE'S OTHER NEEDS IN OUR COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THOSE OTHER NEEDS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NEEDS THOSE BORDER CROSSINGS WE NEED HAVE THOSE FUNDED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. COME UP WITH SOME PLANS TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE BEFORE WE FUND THIS THIS PROJECT THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE.

OH OKAY IT'S ITEM NUMBER THIRTY WHICH IS -- SET. WILL BE IT'S GOING TO BE PERCENT OF HER SENATOR MCGUIRE PLEASE READ. ASSEMBLY BILL ONE FORTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND THAT GOING TO TAXATION AND CUTTING THEIR THROUGHOUT THE TAKE BACK TO ME THE SENATOR MCGUIRE HEY GOOD MORNING MADAM PRESIDENT THANK YOU SO MUCH MEMBERS OF PLEASE TODAY TO BRING FORWARD AB. ONE FORTY SEVEN THIS IS BEEN A COLLABORATION BETWEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER AUTUMN BURKE IS DONE A FANTASTIC JOB. STATE TREASURER FIONA MA IN MYSELF ALONG WITH THE GOOD MEMBERS OF GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S WAY FAIR DECISION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS A WELL THOUGHT OUT AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THE WAY FAIR DECISION IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT U. S. SUPREME COURT DECISIONS IN DECADES. BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE ONLINE AN OUT OF STATE BUSINESSES HAVE HAD. THEY DID NOT COLLECT SALES TAX IN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER BRICK AND MORTAR CALIFORNIA RETAILERS WHO HAVE ALWAYS COLLECTED TAXES. THIS INEQUITY CAN GIVE A BIG ED FROM SEVEN POINT 25% TO MORE THAN 10% DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS ADVANTAGE GOES TO ADD TO SAY COMPANIES AN ONLINE RETAILERS. THIRTY THREE STATES RATHER PRESIDENT ALREADY IMPLEMENTED THE COURT'S DECISION AND EVERY OTHER STATE WITH THE SALES TAX IS EXPECTED TO FOLLOW SUIT. AB ONE FORTY SEVEN DOES THIS FOR THE GOLDEN STATE. THE MEASURE WILL INCREASE STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES BY AN ESTIMATED FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. AND MANY OF THESE LOCAL REVENUES ARE DEDICATED TO LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL. THE BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ALL STAKEHOLDERS CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ONLINE pAND MANY OTHERS. IT WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN ITEM. LOOKING FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE SENATOR SKINNER. HI THANK YOU AYE MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH IT -- TO MAY I BRING UP SOME POINTS SO THE LAW THAT ENABLED CALIFORNIA. TO IN EFFECT REQUIRE INTERNET RETAILERS TO COLLECT SALES TAX WHICH THEY WERE. NOT. REQUIRED TECHNICALLY TO DO -- PRIOR TO TWENTY ELEVEN SO CALIFORNIA'S SALES TAX LAW WAS BASED ON THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA BUT AS INTERNET SALES GREW. AND WE OBVIOUSLY SAW SOME COMPANIES BASICALLY DESIGN THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS MODEL TO AVOID HAVING TO COLLECT SALES TAX. THE STATE'S -- COLLECTION OF SALES TAX BEGAN TO DROP -- AND YET EACH OF US AS INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE IF WE BOUGHT SOMETHING EITHER OUT OF STATE FOR ON LINE. THAT HAD A SALES TAX BUT WE DIDN'T PAY IT DIRECTLY THEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO PAY IT IS USE TAX NOW WHO'S IT HARDER TO COLLECT FROM THE FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO MIGHT YOU KNOW. INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED SOMETHING OR SOME HANDFUL AND WHEN I SEE HIM FOR ME IT'S MORE THAN A HANDFUL BUT IT'S LESS THAN FORTY MILLION CERTAINLY RETAILERS. SO IN TWENTY ELEVEN WE PASSED THE BILL THAT CREATED WHAT'S CALLED THE ALARM ON LONG ARM NEXUS WHICH MEANT WELL ANYWAY. WE'LL WE'LL LEAVE THAT EXPLANATION NOW. AT THAT POINT WE SET THE THRESHOLD AT ONE MILLION SO IN OTHER WORDS. ONLY. INTERNET SELLERS WITH SALES OF A MILLION OR ABOVE HAD TO COLLECT THAT SALES TAX INTERNET OVER THE STATE NO THAT WAS A COMPROMISE. THE OTHER STATES THAT HAD LAWS NEW YORK STATE FOR EXAMPLE IN OTHERS NONE OF THEM HAD IT BELOW TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K.. SO TWO HUNDRED FIFTY K. WAS THE NORMAL THRESHOLD BUT WE SET IT AT A MILLION. NOW WE ARE TAKING UP THIS BILL BECAUSE THE COURT RULED IN THE WAY FAIRS CASE THAT. HEY. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED THE LONG ARM NEXUS EVERY SELLER OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND ABOVE. SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT THE SALES TAX IN STATE SHOULD BE ABLE TO REMOTE IT. OR GET IT. SO I RAISE THAT BECAUSE THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY WHILE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. WHICH IS CURRENTLY WE HAVE THE ONE MILLION SO THIS BRINGS IT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STORE CAPTURE SOME MORE. IT STILL DOES NOT CAPTURE ALL INTERNET SALES NOW THE ARGUMENT THAT SOME WOULD GIVE IS THAT WELL THAT GAP BETWEEN SAY THAT MANY SELLERS AND IT'S A LOT OF HASSLE TO GO AFTER THOSE PEOPLE TO COLLECT THAT SALES TAX. WELL WHAT'S MORE OF A HASSLE GOING AFTER EACH OF US INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THE COLLECTOR USE TAX OR THOSE SELLERS OVER A HUNDRED KA NOW WHAT I WOULD ALSO NOTE. IS. EVERY BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF THEIR SIZE EVEN IF THEIR SALES ARE ONLY FIVE KA YEAR OR TEN K. YEAR MUST COLLECT SALES TAX. SO THIS OSTENSIBLY BEING NICE TO SMALL BUSINESS IS ONLY BEING NICE TO SMALL BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE ARE ALLOWING BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SALES BETWEEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND NOT TO HAVE TO COLLECT OUR SALES TAX SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE MAY WANT TO CORRECT IN THE FUTURE. BUT I SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPROVEMENT AND IT DOES ALLOW US TO COLLECT SOME TAX STARTING NOW IN APRIL BUT I HOPE THAT WE WOULD ADDRESS IT AND DO WHAT THE WAY FAIR DECISION WOULD ALLOW US. TO IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] THING. NINE CENTER MCGUIRE YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU SO MUCH BETTER PRESIDENT IWANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM BERKELEY. SHE TOOK THIS ISSUE ON EARLY ON IN HAS BEEN A CHAMPION HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND SHE NEEDS TO BE COMMENDED.

NUMBER ONE THIS IS THE SAME THRESHOLD THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PRESENTED LAST YEAR TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- IN WAS ULTIMATELY NOT MOVED ON IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN BY INCREASING THE DISTRICT TAX THRESHOLD TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IT NEARS THE SAME THRESHOLD FOR STATE TAX PURPOSES.

OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DOCTOR MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR. AND I RISE TODAY TO ADJOURN IN MEMORY OF YET ANOTHER JURY NOT JUST DEFERRED BUT A DREAM LOST. ONCE AGAIN THE GUN VIOLENCE. ARMENIANS ARE SAID TO THEM. WHO WAS NO MORE POPULARLY BY HIS MONIKER NIPSEY HUSSLE? THIRTY THREE YEAR OLD YOUNG MAN WHO WAS GUNNED DOWN. MID DAY WITH FAMILY MEMBERS PRESENT. IN FRONT OF HIS VERY OWN ESTABLISHMENT. HE WAS THE MANIFESTATION FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OF THE AMERICAN DREAM EVEN THE CALIFORNIA DREAM WERE YOU CAN LIVE AND WORK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YOU GROW UP IN. THE HAVE THAT DREAM GROWING UP IN SOUTH LA DURING THE TURBULENT AIR OF THE NINETIES WAS INDEED VISIONARY. HE WAS A MEMBER OF AN INVESTMENT GROUP. LEADING THE BED TO ACQUIRE SANTA MONICA'S HISTORIC VICEROY HOTEL. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMINATION GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT HE REPRESENTS A NEW GENERATION OF ENTERTAINER. TURNED ACTIVIST TURNED ENTREPRENEUR. WHAT WAS UNIQUE ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN? WITH THAT HE ENCOMPASSED ALL THREE SPACES SIMULTANEOUSLY. HE WAS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN LOCAL PROTESTS AND MEETINGS. AROUND POLICE BRUTALITY GUN VIOLENCE. HE NOT MERELY PURCHASE FRANCHISES BUT HE BECAME. AT INCUBATED NEW CONCEPTS OF ENTERPRISE. HE OPENED A COWORKING SPACE IN STEM CENTER CALLED VECTOR. NINETY IN SOUTH LA. HE PIONEERED INNOVATIVE MEASURES IN MARKETING AND SELF PROMOTION. HE OPENED THE FIRST SMART STORE FOR HIS OWN FRANCHISE BRAND IN SOUTH LA WE'RE VISITORS USE A OUT TO ENHANCE THEIR SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. HE WITH THE EARLY SUPPORTER OF THE NEW ART AND CULTURE PROJECT ALONG THE CRINGE RECORDER. AT THE YOUNG AGE OF THIRTY THREE HE HAD A TEN YEAR HISTORY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY. AT THIS CURRENT ALBUM PREMIERED TO CRITICAL ACCLAIM. ON NUMBER FOUR AT NUMBER FOUR ON THE BILLBOARD CHART. HE AND HIS FAMILY WERE RECENTLY FEATURED. ENOUGH SPREAD IN GENTLEMAN'S QUARTERLY MAGAZINE. THAT INCLUDED ARTISTICALLY FOR DINING PHOTOS TAKEN IN THE HEART OF MY BELOVED SOUTH LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY. THOSE IMAGES REPRESENT WHAT HE BELIEVED WHAT I BELIEVE IS INDEED POSSIBLE. I ROLES ON THIS FLOOR JUST SEVERAL WEEKS AGO TO TALK ABOUT THE TRAUMA A COMMUNITY WAS EXPERIENCING AS A RESULT. OF THE DEATH. BY VIOLENT GUN SHOP OF THE YOUNG STUDENT AT USC. AND ONCE AGAIN MY COMMUNITY OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES IS EXPERIENCING TRAUMA. BASED ON THE LOSS OF A BRAND NEW YOUNG ICON WHEN WE USE THE TERM ICON WE TYPICALLY ARE REFERRING TO SOMEONE. WITH FAR MORE ADVANCED IN AGE BUT THE THIRTY THREE YEAR OLD WAS THE I CON. IN THE INDUSTRY AND IN THE COMMUNITY. THE AMAZING LA TIMES ARTICLE ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS UNTIMELY DEATH. THE TALKED ABOUT THIS NEW COAL WORKING IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LAB IN SOUTH LA THAT HE OPENED. AND HE SHARED THE FACT THAT AS A YOUNG MAN. MUSIC AND TECHNOLOGY OR HIS DREAMS HIS PASSION AND BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RESOURCES HE LEARNED HOW TO BUILD A PC HIMSELF. OUT OF PARTS FOUND. SO HE COULD RECORD HIS OWN MUSIC. HE WAS THE INNOVATOR IN THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SIGN WITH A LABEL UNTIL THIS VERY LAST RECENT ALBUM AFTER TEN YEARS IN THE INDUSTRY. HE CREATED MODELS BY WHICH HE COULD OWN HIS OWN IMAGE. OWN HIS OWN MUSIC AND SELL IT BY CUTTING OUT ALL THE VARIOUS MIDDLE MAN. THAT ENCOMPASS THAT SPACE. AND SO I'M HOPING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE AND OLD PEOPLE LIKE ME ACROSS THE STATE WON'T LOSE THE DREAM [inaudible] OF BUYING PROPERTY TRULY OWNING AND ENVISIONING SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH WE GREW UP IN. REGARDLESS OF WHEN SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TODAY BUT I ASKED THAT WE ALL A JUROR IN MEMORY. OF THE YOUNG MAN OF ERITREAN AN AFRICAN AMERICAN DESCENT. BY THE NAME OF ARMENIA.
