THE EXTENSION WILL NOT HAPPEN.

FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:48.707

IS A CONGRESSIONAL MANDATE AND

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:08.226
THEREFORE- FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:10.395
DOESN'T. NEED TO ADD TO IT FOR

00:22:10.462 --> 00:22:13.732

THE TRAVEL. THAT WE CAN. IF YOU

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.161
CAN ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:17.028
MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAD A

D. E. THE- PULLED. IT ONLINE.

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:32.878
SODA AND THEN THEY HAVE THE

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.279
OPPORTUNITY WHEN THEY'RE

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:36.948
PASSING THROUGH THE AIRPORT TO

TO THEIR GET IN OUR PARTY. THE

00:23:57.936 --> 00:23:58.770
PARKING SO THERE IS A

00:23:58.837 --> 00:24:00.939
COLLABORATION HAPPENING. ON THE

00:24:01.006 --> 00:24:03.241
WAY TO THE GETTING THROUGH THE

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:05.510
GATE THEY HAVE TO HAVE ONE WILL

00:24:05.577 --> 00:24:09.548
STOP JUST AT ONE TIME BY. OKAY

00:24:09.614 --> 00:24:12.784
SELF RIGHT. YES THAT DONE BY A

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:16.188
PRIVATE COMPANY. HE DID NOT SAY

00:24:16.254 --> 00:24:18.156

CERTAINLY PROVIDE TO YOU LATER

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:27.833
ABOUT THE OTHERS. NO I SEE-

00:24:27.899 --> 00:24:31.269
MASK COORDINATION BY THE TRAVEL

00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:32.771
INDUSTRY NOW I EASE SEVERAL

00:24:32.838 --> 00:24:34.906
MONTHS AGO EVEN THE TRAVEL

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.975
INDUSTRY WASN'T COORDINATING ON

00:24:37.042 --> 00:24:38.276
THIS FOR CALIFORNIA THEY

00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:41.646
IMPACTS AND OPPORTUNITIES I

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:45.851
THINK ARE THERE 82% OF OUR

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:46.852
TAVEL SPENDING ACTUALLY IS

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:50.455
CALIFORNIANS TRAVELING AROUND

00:24:50.522 --> 00:24:53.558
CALIFORNIA THAT'S BROWN AND-

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:55.560
BUT NONE I THINK THERE'S AN

00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:57.696
OPPORTUNITY IN TERMS OF THE

00:24:57.762 --> 00:25:00.799
SATURATION OF WHAT WERE SEEN AS

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:02.968
TO BE ABLE TO. RIDLEY HAVE

00:25:03.034 --> 00:25:06.438
SYSTEM. RIGHT AT CALIFORNIANS I

00:25:06.504 --> 00:25:08.240
AM IN AIRPORTS ALMOST EVERY

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:11.810
DAY- BURBANK'S DONE A GREAT JOB

00:25:11.877 --> 00:25:14.279
BUT THERE'S OTHERS THAT IT'S I

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:17.282
A HE SAY IT TO IT IT'S A HIT

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.350
AND MISS BUT I ACTUALLY THINK

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:22.087
THE- ALSO. TSA AT THE FEDERAL

00:25:22.153 --> 00:25:24.289
APPARATUS AND I THINK THERE'S A

00:25:24.356 --> 00:25:25.924
LACK OF CONSISTENCY WHEN YOU'RE

00:25:25.991 --> 00:25:28.260
BEING ASKED TO SHOW YOUR ID

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.295
THERE- IF IT'S NOT REAL ID

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:31.696
THERE SHOULD BE A VERBAL

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:33.865
SOMETIMES THERE'S A SIGN AT THE

00:25:33.932 --> 00:25:37.836
AIRPORT BUT WHY VERBAL IT'S THE

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.838
BREAK THROUGH OF MESSAGING WE

00:25:39.905 --> 00:25:43.141
NEED A CONSUMER EVEN A BLIND TO

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:49.781
THE SIDE BUT IT AUDIO SO TSA.

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:51.950

SOME AIRLINES THAT HAVE DONE A

01:36:03.524 --> 01:36:04.058
VERY GOOD JOB YOU KNOW UNITED

OPPORTUNITY. OKAY SO THAT'S

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.072
SOMETHING WE CAN WORK ON WITH

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:20.441
THE INDUSTRY YEAH I THINK WITH

01:36:20.508 --> 01:36:21.041
THE WITH THE TRADE GROUPS ARE

01:36:21.108 --> 01:36:23.010
HERE I THINK THAT THEY I THINK

01:36:23.077 --> 01:36:24.745
THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT THE-

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:28.015

VACATION OR BUSINESS WHATEVER

01:36:39.894 --> 01:36:44.265
AND THEN THEY REALIZE THAT.

01:36:44.331 --> 01:36:45.799
THEY'RE BOOKING A HOTEL ROOM OR

01:36:45.866 --> 01:36:48.202
SOMETHING LIKE THAT THEY HAVE

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:49.970
TO REALIZE THAT THERE'RE.

01:36:50.037 --> 01:36:54.074
TRAVEL PLANS VIA AN AIRLINE HAS

01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:57.378
TO BE INVOLVING A REAL ID

01:36:57.444 --> 01:36:57.945
BEFORE THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET

01:36:58.012 --> 01:37:00.648

01:37:00.714 --> 01:37:02.449
CANCELLATIONS AND ALL THE

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:04.051

YEAH I THINK IF THE IF THE

01:37:17.665 --> 01:37:19.800
INDUSTRY ACROSS THE BOARD COULD

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:20.834
BETTER COMMUNICATE THAT YOU
