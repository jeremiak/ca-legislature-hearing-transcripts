THE LA YOU [inaudible] I KNOW. EVERY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S MAYOR VISION PROPOSAL SUPPORTS CONTROLLERS ONGOING EFFORTS TOWARDS REPLACING THE STATE. IN THESE GO TO BOTH [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. WE BELIEVE IT WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. OKAY WE SHOULDN'T DO THE OTHER. ISSUE. TWO FIVE ALSO. I'M NOT THE SECOND ISSUE ARE ISSUE FIVE IS -- THE CALENDAR SPENDING THE ON AS YOU LEARNED OF THIS ITEM -- AT THE SAME TIME AS A LEGISLATURE WITH THE RELEASE OF MAY REVISE LAST WEEK -- WE ARE UNCLEAR AS TO WHY THE FUNDING APPROVED LAST YEAR FOR CRITICAL FOR CRITICAL POINT IN THE PROJECT WOULD BE REMOVED FROM OUR BUDGET. THE PROJECT TEAM IS CURRENTLY ON SCHEDULE AS APPROVED BY CDT TO WORK THROUGH A PROOF OF CONCEPT IN. NINETEEN TWENTY FOR THE SYSTEM INTEGRATOR WITHIN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPLACEMENT SYSTEM ESTIMATED FOR SEPTEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS A REMINDER IT IS CRITICAL THAT THE STATE COMPLETE THE REPLACEMENT OF THE EXISTING HOW LATER SYSTEM TIMELY. DUE TO SYSTEM SECURITY AND SUPPORT RISKS. REMOVAL OF THE SEVEN HUNDRED FOUR THOUSAND WOULD ELIMINATE. THE RESOURCES TO PERFORM THIS WORK AND SO SCO COULD NOT CONTINUE THE PROJECT. WE ABSENT A REPLACEMENT ARM WE COULD RETURN IT TO THE MANUAL PROCESS WHICH HAS A COST IMPACT TO SCO CLAIM AUDITS AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENTS. WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY ON IT THE REIMBURSABLE RATES [inaudible] FINANCE. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THE PROPOSAL IS. AND BEING -- SO THE WITH WELL -- AS THE MARKET HAS BEEN UNDER WAY AND INTERFACES. OTHER ISSUES THIS WILL ALLOW -- AND TO COME BACK AND SO. WE WE SEEM TO BE GETTING. INFORMATION AND I REALIZE THIS IS THE GROUP CONTROL IS ALL ABOUT THE SPELL. THIS CALL IS. EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE. INTEGRATIONS GOING FINE. THE CONCERN OF MINE THAT. YOU WANT TO PAUSE THE PROJECT. IN ORDER TO GET THIS GUY OUT. BASICALLY UP TO SPEED. SEEMS TO ME THAT THESE. PRESS DOES ALSO SOME OF THESE ARE INDEPENDENT EFFORTS RIGHT AND I'M. CONCERNED. THAT WE'RE NOT ACCELERATING. THE REVISION THE MODERNIZATION STATES A ROLE SYSTEM. I REMEMBER YEARS AGO THERE WAS TALK ABOUT. BACK THE SYSTEM WAS. CREDIBLY ANTIQUATED OPERATING ON KOBOL WE'RE YOU KNOW. BRING BACK RETIRED A NEW AND SOME ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE SYSTEM FUNCTION AND SO ANY DELAY. PAUSES ME CONCERNED. IF THE PAYROLL SYSTEM GOT A BIT. IT'S NOT LIKE SYBIL THAT'S GOING. TO INFLUENCE AN EMPTY OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT POLICY. NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER. TWO SHOULD BREAK DOWN THE BEACH. IT WORKS ALL AROUND THIS BUILDING [inaudible] SO. IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THOSE. SO SURE AND JUST TO VERIFY THAT THE MAYOR VISIONING FUNDING TO CONTINUE. AND FOR THOSE RESOURCES ARE RECOMMENDED A PERMANENT REPORT IS BUT ONE RIGHT. AND THEN THERE'S THE OTHER PARTY OR THE OTHER REIMBURSEMENT CLAIM THAT ONE BECAUSE IT. THE SEPARATE FUNCTION MAKING SURE THAT INTEGRATE BASED ON THE IN WITH OTHER INTERFACE. WHAT IS CONTROL IS AUTISTIC? BOX. THIS GAL IN ANY WAY. WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS REFERENCED IS THE FUTURE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS? AND WE HAVE THE STATE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE APPROVED A GREAT INVESTMENT TO GET US TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE. THIS NEXT YEAR WOULD BE CONDUCTING THE PROOF OF CONCEPT WHICH WOULD. DETERMINE WHICH BOB FORMED BEST SERVES THE STATE SO IN NO WAY ARE WE BUILDING INTERFACES WITHIN THIS NEXT FISCAL YEAR. SO THAT'S NOT A CONCERN OR AN IMPACT IN ANY WAY ON THE INTERFACES. THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WANTS TO ENSURE GETS BUILT IN IS STABLE IN THE FISCAL SYSTEMS. THEIR RELATIONSHIP NO TOUCHING IT AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. AT THE END OF THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR WE CONTINUE WITH THE FUNDING WE WILL KNOW WHICH BOB FORM WILL BEST SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AT THAT FUTURE TIME. REQUIREMENTS WOULD THEN BE WRITTEN AND DESIGNED FOR THE INTERFACE BUT AGAIN THIS IS NOT A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS PROJECT AT THIS TIME. THIS CALL ASKED THAT IT IS THE ITEM NUMBER. FIVE THE SEVEN NOT MUCH SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS BE. BASICALLY MOVED THE BUDGET. LS BUT NO NO THAT THAT THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE BACK TO THE RESPONSE? WE WE FEEL THAT. AT THIS POINT IN THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE MARKET OF PALATABLE LIFE PART OF LIFE. IT IN THE ALTERNATIVE DEVELOPMENT. AND BEFORE IT GETS INTO THE POLLUTION DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT WE THINK THAT WE SHOULD. ALL THESE OTHER THINGS THEY'RE GOING ON WITH. THEY WILL ALL HAVE. GET A LITTLE PART [inaudible] WELL. I DON'T FIND THAT CONVINCING. THIS CAL IS A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE WHICH KEEPS STUMBLING OVER. AND IT'S BEEN AROUND FAR TOO LONG. TO KEEP GIVING SLACK HERE OR THERE. IF WITH YOU THEY'LL BE SOME OTHERS THAT HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY THE MAN CHAIR I CANNOT GO ALONG WITH IT. THE LATE ALL [inaudible] SO WHAT. IN IN YOU'LL INDULGE MY BOTH NEWNESS AND MAYBE IGNORANCE IS IT SO THIS GIRL IS AN **** FOR THIS CONTROL OFF. NASA'S BUT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DISASTER. SELECT IT THE ENTIRE BUDGET PROPOSAL WELL AS WE'RE LOOKING AT VARIOUS. ITEMS GOING FORWARD WITH IT THIS PIECE OF THAT. IF THIS MOTION BE BODIES. SO THE PROJECT IN THOSE EFFORTS. OTHER AT THE PUMP. OR OTHER MEANING YOU OTHER INTEGRATED [inaudible] THIS ITEM [inaudible] THANK. I GET THAT YOU WANT TO I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE WE WE HAVE THIS CALL. BUT I BELIEVE BE SMART PEOPLE THERE THAT ARE TECHNICALLY PROFICIENT WITH THE PATROL IS OFFICE. CHARGE OF PAYROLL IS ALL TOGETHER AND THAT'S MY WORK. OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I'LL ONLY LOVE SOMEBODY SOMEBODY. HE'S SAID THAT THEY SHOULD BE PAUSE IN. SO I'M I'M LISTENIN DEALS. THAT THAT THAT. IT'S NOT. BOTH IT'S COMMONLY USED. PHRASES COMMONLY USED TO WRITE. SO IS IT THAT. THE ADMINISTRATION BELIEVES THIS FUNDING THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING IN WHERE INVESTING THE FUNDING NEEDED. WITH TE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON THE MOST IMPORTANT. PROGRAM WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES LIKE THIS GIRL. THIS IS A REALLY. MALTESE I IMAGINE. RIGHT. A DRESS. I'M I JUST WANNA [inaudible] SO. SO LOOKING AT THE TOTALITY OF IT RIGHT THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOU'RE SAYING. LET'S HOLD OFF ON THIS LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE MOST IMPORTANT. AND AND FOCUS ON THOSE WITH THIS OFFER A BIT IT'S NOT GONNA. THROW EVERYTHING OUT OF WHACK RIGHT THE PROJECT WOULD NOT BE AMPLE THAT WOULD JUST BE. SO ANY EFFORT TO DATE WOULD BE ARCHIVED. WHEN WHEN? THE REVIEW IT. YES. AND I'M SORRY CAN INTRODUCE MYSELF REGIONALLY IN GENERAL AND THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER. OTHER STOCK THANK YOU. AND HOUSING THE PROJECT RIGHT. WOULD CAUSE AND EVERYTHING WE'VE INVESTED IN AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO BE WASTED THERE IS NOTHING THAT SOUTH TO PULL UP TO THIS POINT BECAUSE WE'VE NOT YET AND ON SEPT. ALL WE HAVE. PLEADED WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT. IS THE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY WE WILL USE TO DO THAT. ON SET AND THE REASON THAT THE PAS IS. CRITICAL IN A VERY DAMAGING WAY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE CURRENT LEADER SYSTEM. WHICH PAYS OUT OVER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS. CURRENTLY HAS THE BUILT IN THRESHOLD TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T EXPLOITING. AND TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT LIMITS HOTEL LIMITS FOOD LIMITS. IF THIS IS PAUSED OUR CALENDARS SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY SET TO EXPIRE BY IBM NEXT YEAR. WE'VE ASKED FOR AN EXTENSION ON THAT CONTRACT. IF THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS PAUSED THE COST OF THAT EXTENSION IS GOING TO BE SKYROCKETING SO WE WILL BE HELD AT A MUCH HIGHER. THRESHOLD IF YOU WILL BY IBM. TO COME UP WITH THE EXTENSION ON THE CURRENT CONTRACT. IF THE PROJECT. IF OUR CURRENT CALENDAR SYSTEM GOES DOWN WE HAVE TO RESORT TO MANUALLY OUR OFFICE HAS SEEN. I'M TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS THERE'S NO AUDIT THERE THAT WOULD STOP PEOPLE FROM CLAIMING MORE IN COUNTIES THEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WERE ALREADY PAYING OUT MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE MILLION. AUDITING STAFF ALONE AT THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WOULD MORE THAN DOUBLE TO TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH. THE AUDITING OF TRAVEL EXPENSE CLAIMS WHERE WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT DOES IT IN AN AUTOMATED FASHION. AND THE WORKLOAD ON THE DEPARTMENTS IF WE WERE TO GO TO A PAPER SYSTEM IS ENORMOUS RIGHT NOW THIS IS AN ELECTRONIC SYSTEM THAT HAS. WORKED LOW ROUTING AND PEOPLE DON'T HAVE. TO IT TAKES YOU KNOW PAPER AROUND FROM PERSON TO PERSON TO PERSON TO GET THESE APPROVED AND SO. THE ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACT ON PERMITS WOULD BE HUGE THE ADMINISTRATIVE IMPACT. TO THE STATE IS VERY LARGE AND WE HAVE A SECURITY RISK. THE SECURITY SYSTEM RIGHT NOW ON THE CALENDARS IN THE REASON IBM IS NO LONGER SUPPORTING IT. IS BECAUSE THERE IS AN EXPLOITABLE SECURITY RISK WITH THIS PLATFORM. AND IBM HAS SAID THIS IS NOT THEIR INTENTION TO KEEP THIS PRODUCT GOING AGAIN BECAUSE THIS. IN THAT PAYS OUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- ANNUALLY MORE THAN THAT. WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT AS A SECURITY RISK IN CYBER SECURITY BEING ONE OF THE HIGHEST CONCERNS OF THE LEGISLATURE. WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE A VULNERABLE SYSTEM WITH OUT A PLAN RIGHT NOW TO BE REPLACING THAT TECHNOLOGY BEFORE IT FAILS. AND AGAIN THE RESOURCES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY DIRECTED TO THIS PRODUCT PROJECT. ARE NOT IN ANY WAY RELATED. TO THE RESOURCES SCO HAS BEEN IMPROVED TO DEDICATE TOWARDS THIS GAL OUR COMMITMENT TO FISCAL REMAINS UNCHANGED THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WORKING ON THE SCALE. REMAINED FULLY DEDICATED AND AND CHANGE THEY ARE NOT THE SAME RESOURCES THAT ARE WORKING ON A LATER. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF HE WIPES OUT LATER. YES. YEAH I WOULD MOVE. MISSION REQUEST I THINK THEY'VE NOT MADE A COMPELLING ARGUMENT HERE BUT IF YOU WANTED TO CONTINUE. OKAY SO WHERE. THAT'S WITH REGARDS TO CAL EIGHTERS. THE TRAVEL NUMBER. FIVE REJECT REJECT THAT THAT TO DECREASE ANOTHER WAY REJECTED DECREASED. C. BUT THEN IT LOOKS LIKE IS IT. I COULDN'T EVEN SAY IT'S ANY SOUND AND FOUND -- WHICH I THINK IS THIS BILL IS ALL THE WAY COMPLETE ARE YOU SAY YOU HAVE AN ESTABLISHED CONTRACT. WITH IBM CORRECT [inaudible] AND THIS WOULD BE AN ABROGATION OF THAT PROVISION DONE THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO NEGOTIATE A HIGHER. RIGHT WE NEED AN EXTENSION -- TO CONTINUE WITH THEM AND IT WOULD BE OF LIMITED DURATION THE OZ THE TERM OF THE HOUSE IS NOT IDENTIFIED. IF THE PAUSES TO CONTINUE IN THIS GAL IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN ALL OF ITS BASES. THERE'S A GREAT VULNERABILITY THE STATE WITH THAT IN IBM IS IN A POSITION TO THEN. QUOTE ANY COSTS THAT THEY WANT ANY PRICE TO US THAT THEY WANT -- TO LIMP ALONG THIS SYSTEM FOR US INTO WE'RE IN A POSITION I HATE TO BE SO CYNICAL BUT I EXPECT WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK YOU'RE THE SAME THING NEXT YEAR. MONTREAL ALL MOVED ITEM. ONE IF YOU WANT. WE HAVE -- ISSUE. ONE THE MOST -- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE MOVING IN ITEM ONE THE CS YES HAS WRITTEN YEARS. I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY ITEM. ONE ISSUE ONE ISSUE. ONE WHICH ISSUE ONE WHICH IS TO APPROVE THE BUDGET AS WELL. THIS IS THE INCLUDES A ONE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND A SPORTS SIX ADDITIONAL POSITIONS ALTERNATIVE PLAN. I'M SORRY YES UNDER C. S. P. S.. RIGHT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME SHEET OF MUSIC. SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT AS FAR AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM -- IF IF WE GO WITH BE -- RECOMMENDED SOLUTION WHICH IS THE SIX POSITIONS IN THE FUNDING ON THE ON THE STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM. WE WILL INCUR A ONE YEAR DELAY ON THE CURRENT PROJECT AND IN A FINANCE. IS IN SUPPORT OF THIS NEW SCHEDULE DELAY CURRENTLY THIS PROJECT AS YOU KNOW HAS THE REPLACEMENT PROJECT FOR PAYROLL. HAS BEEN ON TRACK AND IT'S IN THE POWER OF PROCESS AND WE WILL SEE D. T. APPROVAL. BUT THE ALTERNATIVE ONE THAT'S RECOMMENDED FOR SUPPORT THEIR NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR SCHEDULE. AND BY A FULL YEAR AND AND THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE SEES THAT AS A NEGATIVE. OKAY I'M CONFUSED WE MAYBE LOOK AT DIFFERENT -- MATERIALS -- SO. pANALYSIS ON ISSUE? ONE SO IT IT SAYS. LET ME READ THIS AND THAT. THIS IS CORRECT. IT SAYS S. ZERO REQUEST FUNDING TO SUPPORT. SIX SESSIONS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IN ONGOING DO YOU WORK ON THE PROJECT OF HIS WILL DRIVE THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING OPTIONS. AND DESIGNING A NEW STATE WIDE THEY WILL APPROACH AND THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT'S NOT ACT. WELL I AM SORRY THAT IS ACCURATE THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS ACCURATE AND THAT IS -- THE APPROVED BCP BETWEEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE SCO. BUT WE DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH THAT APPROACH. WE HAD A SECOND ALTERNATIVE IN THE B. C. P.. WHERE WE REQUESTED -- TO STAY ON TRACK WITH THE CURRENT SCHEDULE. THIS APPROVED ALTERNATIVE DELAYS THE CURRENT PROJECT BY TWELVE MONTHS OR MORE. AND WE WERE SEEKING TO AVOID ANY FURTHER DELAYS ON THE STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT'S SUCH A VULNERABLE AND FRAGILE SYSTEM YOU'RE ASKING BOTH KNOW THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE ADVOCATE THAT WE BOTH KNOW. ONE CORRECT. AND THAT. CHRIS MALE AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT. NOT ONLY DOES ALTERNATIVE ONE DELAY THE PROJECT PLANNING BY AB. I DON'T SEE WHAT WHAT WHAT IS ALL MAYBE. AFTER IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT ALTERNATIVE ONE AND ALL SO TO LET ME MAKE A SUGGESTION BECAUSE THIS IS ALL. FIRST OF ALL WE JUST HEARD ABOUT THIS A FEW MINUTES BEFORE. YOU KNOW THE MEETING STARTED SO. IT'S REALLY UNFAIR. TO DISORDER DROP THESE. PROPOSED CHANGES OR OBJECTIONS SO I WOULD -- SUGGEST THAT WE HOLD THIS OPEN SO WE COULD SORT THIS OUT -- BECAUSE IT IT CAN BE VERY CONFUSING TO US TO HAVE THIS OUT WITHOUT THE NOTICE IN THE INFORMATION ON THE CONVERSATION.

SENDING ON THE SITE. OKAY THIS IS AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL SO OF MAY RE REVISED OF OF PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION. THEMSELVES USE TAX FOR SALES OF DIAPERS MITCHELL PRODUCTS. CALIFORNIA GENERALLY TAXES A SALEABLE TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY LESSONS THERE IS A SPECIFIC EXEMPTION. OUR FROM SALES TAX. IT IS ALSO GENERAL RULE FOR THE SALES TAX TO ALLOW FOR EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN SAYS CITIES. THE PROPOSED APPROACH TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RECOGNIZED THE NECESSITY NATURE OF DIAPERS AND MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS. AND THIS PROVIDES AN EXEMPTION FROM SALES TAX [inaudible] FOR DIAPERS. CHILDREN AND FOR MR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS TO MAKE CERTAIN THE SUBSIDIES AFTER FAMILIES MORE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. PARTICULARLY FOR THE NEEDIEST FAMILIES. THE COST OF THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE ESTIMATED AT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION GENERAL FUND AND IN. TWENTY NINE TWENTY AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION IN A GENERAL FUND IN NINETEEN I'M IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BOTH THE EXEMPTIONS ARE SCHEDULED FOR SUNSET. I'M SORRY YOUR THEIR SCHEDULED TO TAKE EFFECT OF JANUARY ONE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY AND TO SUNSET AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO ALLOW REVIEW AND AND THIS CONFLICT [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] LEO. CHRISTINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON THESE PROPOSALS FIRST -- AS FINANCE MENTIONED -- CALIFORNIA SALES TAX HAS SIMILAR EXEMPTIONS FOR CERTAIN NECESSITIES. HOWEVER AT THE SAME TIME THE SALES TAX ALSO APPLIES TO A LONG LIST OF SESAME IS -- OUR OTHER COMMENTS MOST OF THEM ARE SUMMARIZED HERE IN IN THE AGENDA SO WE'RE GOING TO THEM AND IN A A LOT OF DETAIL JUST. BRIEFLY OUR FIRST ON THE DIAPER EXEMPTION WE KNOW IT IT'S IT'S LESS TARGETED BEEN SOME ALTERNATIVES ONE ALTERNATIVE WE IDENTIFIES TO USE THOSE FUNDS -- FOR CHILD -- SO THAT OUR SECOND POINT IS A REGARDING THE EQUITY CONCERNED AT THE MENSTRUAL PRODUCTS EXEMPTION IS ATTEMPTING PRESS WE WOULD JUST ONE OUT THIS CONCERN IT'S CROSSCUTTING ACROSS A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS AND SO. THE LEGISLATURE HAS A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FOR ADDRESS. CROSS THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX -- CAL GRANTS POWER TO BRAVE OTHER PROGRAMS NOT WHEN THE SALES TAX. OUR THIRD POINT IS REGARDING THE NOT SUNSET DATE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSED FOR THE EXEMPTIONS WHICH IS TWO YEARS AFTER THEIR IMPLEMENTED -- IN OUR VIEW THAT'S TOO SHORT A TIME PERIOD AND WE YOU A RANGE OF FORTY TEN YEARS AS MORE REASONABLE. AND FINALLY OUR THIS BLESSED EMITS FOR THESE PROPOSALS ARE. A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S OR NOTABLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I SHOULD SAY THE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT ALL YEAR. SEC. THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND AND SEVENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OVER ON OUR ESTIMATES ARE. MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. ONE MILLION [inaudible] SENATORS [inaudible] QUESTION. PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE. HELLO DANIEL CANDLE KAISER ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION IS A NON TEACHING THAT THERE IS PENDING LEGISLATION. OR THIS BODY WHICH MADE IT TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK BEFORE SEE TERRY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION WHICH WAS ALSO VETO BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AS PROPOSED THESE EXEMPTIONS WOULD REDUCE THE GENERAL FUND REVENUES BY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR THEREAFTER. WITH A PROP NINETY EIGHT IMPACT OF SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS RESPECTIVELY. SEAT HERE A AS IT HAS IN THE PAST -- JUST THE LEGISLATURE TO FOREGO NON TARGETED TAX EXEMPTIONS IN FAVOR DIRECT FUNDING ALLOCATIONS. THE BENEFIT THOSE MOST IN NEED. THE REVISED PROPOSAL INCLUDES A SUNSET OF TWO YEARS FOR EACH ITEM RIGHTFULLY NOTING THE STATE'S NEED TO PRIORITIZE EXPENDITURES INTO THE FUTURE AND IN THIS CASE OF POTENTIAL ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. THIS DIFFERS FROM FIVE YEAR SUNSET AB PROPOSING ABIES. SIXTY SIX AND A. B.. THIRTY ONE ADVOCATES OF PUBLICLY CALLED FOR THE GOVERNOR TO ELIMINATE THE SUN SO ALL TOGETHER. AND MARKS THE EXEMPTION PERMANENT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR LEVEL. I'VE NEED SUCH AN ACTION WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERTURN IN THE FUTURE AND WE WOULD OPPOSE ANY LENGTHENING OR TERMINATION OF THE SUNSET. IN THE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEE TERRY COLLABORATED WTH THE COALITION OF EDUCATORS AND CHILDREN'S ADVOCATES TO CONDUCT A PRETTY PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF EXISTING TAX EXPENDITURES FROM INCOME. CORPORATION SALES AND USE TAX TAXES. INDICATE THAT BY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE THERE WILL BE A FIVE HUNDRED AND SIX POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN REVENUE. TO THE STATE GENERAL FUND SINCE.

THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION THAT IN PROP THIRTY I WAS A LINCHPIN OF OUR SUPPORT FOR THAT -- FOR THAT REALIGNMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT PROP THIRTY OBLIGATES -- IT PROTECTS THAT FUNDING OBLIGATES THE STATE TO BACK BILL AT THE VERY LEAST THAT PORTION OF THE SALES TAX EXEMPTION SUCH AS SUCH AS THESE.

THE OPENING ON TWO ISSUES ISSUES NOT FORTY FIVE ISSUE. FORTY FIVE SENATOR. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT. WHAT IT WOULD? AND THEN ISSUE FORTY FORTY SIX IS THE PREPARE OUR ADMIN CHIEF J. STURGIS -- I WANT TO BEGIN BY -- ASSURING SECRETARY SUSE REGRETS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO BE HERE IN PERSON TO PRESENTTHE BUDGET PROPOSAL -- I KNOW THAT SHE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SHARING IT WITH YOU -- BUT WILL PREVENT AT PRESENT A BRIEF SKETCH -- TO BEGIN A CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE PROPOSAL RELATES TO THE FUTURE WORK COMP COMMISSION. AND AS YOU KNOW ON MAY FIRST THE GOVERNOR ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING THE FUTURE FOR COMMISSION -- ITS TASK IS TO A SIX TO BETTER UNDERSTAND INFLUENCE AND PREPARE FOR CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY AND THE NATURE OF WORK DUE TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND THE AUTOMATION OF JOBS AND EXPANDED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE -- THE COMMISSION IS IS INTENDED TO BE A PUBLIC PROCESS. ONE SS AN AGENDA FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CALIFORNIA TO SUPPORT BOTH INNOVATION. SUSTAIN THE SOCIAL COMPACT. A GUIDED BY THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER -- THE COMMISSION WILL TRANSLATE ITS COMMITMENTS AND AGREEMENTS INTO A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR THE GOVERNMENT PRIVATE SECTOR AND LABOR. A PROGRESS REPORT IS DUE TO THE GOVERNOR IN FEBRUARY -- TWENTY TWENTY BECAUSE OF THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION IS ASSIGNED TO LABOR AGENCY THE BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES A NUMBER OF POSITIONS. TO ADD CAPACITY TO AGENCIES TO FILL THE ROLE. A SECOND AND RELATED FOCUS OF THE BUDGET PROPOSAL IS HOW LABOR AGENCIES FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS ARE ORGANIZED TO BEST RESPOND -- TO THESE CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY -- WE ARE TAKING A FRESH LOOK AT HOW ARE DEPARTMENTS WORK TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT. SERVICE DELIVERY AND OUTREACH BY WAY OF EXAMPLE -- AGENCIES IN THE MIDST OF RETHINKING HOW ITS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES ARE ORGANIZED -- CURRENTLY THESE -- WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUNCTIONS ARE HOUSED IN FOUR DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WITHIN THE AGENCY WE BELIEVE WE CAN BETTER ALIGN THESE PROGRAMS -- THROUGH A REORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION INTO ONE NEW DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE AGENCY -- SO THE BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD ADD POSITIONS AT LABOR AGENCY TO LEAVE THESE TYPES OF EFFORTS WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING SERVICES AND MAKING THE BEST USE. THROUGHOUT THE AGENCY IN OUR DEPARTMENT. HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON JAZZ ALAMO WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THE STAFF AGENDA INCLUDES A FEW SEVERAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL -- ONE OF THEM RELATES TO WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE WILL BE WHETHER BE OVERSIGHT OR THE LEGISLATURE'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE COMMISSION -- INCLUDING OUR THE LEGISLATURE'S ROLE IN IN DESIGNATING SOME OF THE BOARD MEMBERS POTENTIALLY -- AND THAT'S YET TO BE TO BE SEEN AT THIS POINT A SECOND QUESTION RELATES TO HOW THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION WILL SORT. BE INTEGRATED WITH THE UNIFIED STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PLAN THAT THAT THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD ASSEMBLES. IT IS AN EXISTING PLANNED IT MANY STAKEHOLDERS PROVIDE. COMMENTARY AND AND FEEDBACK INTO INTO HOW WILL THESE -- TWO PLANS AND THE COMMISSION INTERACT OR BE RELATED ON AND THEN THE THE THIRD QUESTION THAT'S BROUGHT UP THAT. THAT WE ALSO WOULD -- SORT OF ECHO IS THE HOW THIS COMMISSION THE THE COMMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF WORK WILL BE RELATED TO OR SORT OF SUBSUMES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE WORK GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF WORK WHICH WAS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. THAT WORK GROUP HAD A A MORE CLEAR CLIMATE POLICY FOCUS ON IT WAS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS AND IT'S SORT OF BEING INCORPORATED AS WE UNDERSTAND IT INTO THIS PROPOSAL SO THERE'S A QUESTION AS TO HOW THOSE ELEMENTS WILL BE. WILL BE -- ACCOUNTED FOR WITH THIS COMMISSION [inaudible] MEN'S. I AM MARK A MARK MEADOWS APARTMENT A FINANCE JUST WANTED -- TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT WE'VE WE HAVEN'T HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS OF CUTS -- SUPPORTED AT THIS TIME. OKAY MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THIS BIG BY ITSELF. THE THING. PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS SO. IN TERMS THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THINGS I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE LISTED THERE IS A A RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE BUT CONTINGENT UPON. CERTAIN SPECIFIC. ITEMS -- AND I THINK THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE. GOOD -- THAT ARE NOT YET SPECIFIED -- THE ONLY ONE I CAN'T SEE HERE IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT INTEGRATING WITH THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. THAT ITEM COULD BE INCLUDED IN THIS LANGUAGE -- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WHETHER INCLUDED OR NOT WHAT WILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS A COMMISSION MOVES FORWARD IT IT'S MORE OF AN OPEN QUESTION OKAY. OKAY. MAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT SORT OF NOTED. BY YOU WITH SOMETHING. THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED SURE MAKES I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT. I CAN OFFER A LITTLE. INFORMATION AROUND THAT -- SO THAT WE OWE A STATE PLAN IS -- ESSENTIALLY A COMPLIANCE A DOCUMENT ANNA THAT IS PART OF THE WORKFORCE INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITY ACT ARE REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. IN ORDER FOR THE STATE TO RECEIVE ITS FEDERAL FUNDING IS A FOUR YEAR STRATEGY -- FOR THE INVESTMENT OF FEDERAL WORK FORCE TRAINING AND EMPLOYMENT DOLLARS -- AND IT LAYS OUT HOW -- THE VARIOUS -- CORE PROGRAMS THE TITLE ONE THROUGH -- FOUR WILL COORDINATE AND WORK TOGETHER FOR SERVICE DELIVERY -- AND EVERY TWO YEARS THERE ARE PLAN UPDATES -- THAT ARE SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SO IT WOULD -- THE THE WORK AND RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME OUT OF THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD NATURALLY BE KIND OF WOULD PERCOLATE INTO THAT PROCESS -- BY EXTENSION AS A BECAUSE OF THE WELL. BECAUSE OF SEVERAL CONCURRENT THINGS -- BECAUSE OF ALSO THIS REORGANIZATION THAT -- IS INTENDED OF WORKFORCE SERVICES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT THEY'LL BE MUCH GREATER ALIGNMENT -- ALONG THOSE -- IN THOSE AREAS -- AND THE COMMISSION WITH THE COMMISSION'S ACTIVITIES BEING PART OF LABOR AGENCY AS WELL SO. WE SEE THAT AS KIND OF A NATURAL. AFFINITY THERE [inaudible] OKAY -- WITH QUESTIONS COMMENTS PUBLIC COMMENT [inaudible] ON THIS. OKAY HEARING NONE COULD HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. OF LOCAL PLEASE. SENATOR ASA HI. THERE NIELSEN. CENTER I'M BURKE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- PAID FAMILY LEAVE ISSUE [inaudible] FORTY EIGHT SENATE -- THE STAFF AS WELL. AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRIOR SUPPORT OF OUR OTHER BY GENRE. FAMILIES -- THIS -- ITEM INCLUDES SEVERAL DIFFERENT -- PROJECTS AT THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING ON ALSO INCLUDES THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO INCREASE IN THIS RIGHT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE MAYBE. BUT POLITICS SENATOR -- DIRECTOR PATRICK CUTTING WITH EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR A STAFF. ESPECIALLY -- BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT. THIS GOES -- TO HELP THE PAID FAMILY PROGRAM -- CONTINUE TO THRIVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA VERY PROUD. OF THE FIRST IN THE NATION OF THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM -- AND THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE'RE SEEKING HELP CONTINUED BUT ACROSS [inaudible] OKAY. WHEN WE GET TO WHAT THE? RECOMMENDATION ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HERE. HELLO SORRY NO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU -- ALL SERVE RESERVE MY COMMENTS -- TO TWO COMPONENTS OF OF THESE PROPOSALS THERE ARE SEVERAL PROPOSALS GROUP TOGETHER IN THIS ITEM ON ONE RELATES TO THAT THE TECHNOLOGY PROCESS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO UNDERTAKE TO EXTEND PAID FAMILY LEAVE FROM. SIX WEEKS TO EIGHT WEEKS -- TYPICALLY -- TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS LIKE THIS -- ARE OVERSEEN THROUGH THE THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS WHICH IN NINETEEN OVERSIGHT PROCESS ON THE TRAILER BILL. FOR FOR THIS EXTENSION EXAMS THIS TECHNOLOGY PROCESS PROJECT FROM THAT OVERSIGHT PROJECT. ON IT'S NOT CLEAR TO OUR OFFICE AT THIS TIME WHY -- THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS BEING EXEMPTED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S OWN OVERSIGHT TOOL -- WHEN WHEN ASKING ASKING THE DEPARTMENT THEY INDICATED TO US THAT? HOT THE PROJECT WAS THAT WAS EXEMPTED FOR TWO REASONS FIRST THAT IT'S RELATIVELY STRAIGHTFORWARD IS NOT A TERRIBLY COMPLEX ENDEAVOR -- ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT AND SO THEREFORE ISN'T AS RISKY AS SOME OTHER PROJECTS. AND SECONDLY THAT THAT -- PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE PROCESS CAN TEND A LENGTH. IMPLEMENTATION ON THE BENEFIT BEING THAT IT REDUCES SOME RISK -- BUT THE DEPARTMENT INDICATED TO US THAT THEY WERE. CONCERNED THAT BY GOING THROUGH THE POWER PROCESS. THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY IMPLEMENTATION DATE ON TO REGARDING THAT THE TECHNOLOGY PROCESS. THERE ARE TRADE OFFS TO DISCIPLINE THE FLAG IT FOR THIS SUBCOMMITTEE AS IT CONSIDERS. ITS OVERSIGHT ROLE AND AND AS WELL AS THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S OVERSIGHT ROLE OF OF THE TECHNOLOGY PROCESS RELATED TO PAID FAMILY LEAVE [inaudible] ON MIKE MY SECOND SET OF COMMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH THAT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN PARTICULAR -- OUTLINING -- SOME OF THE DETAILS -- THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS AS PART OF A TASK FORCE LOOKING AT IN INTO. A PAID FAMILY LEAVE CHANGES IN THE FUTURE. OUR OFFICE EARLIER THIS YEAR. RELEASE REPORT ON THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM AND ONE OF OUR KEY RECOMMENDATIONS WAS. FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER ITS OWN GOALS AND AND POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHICH MIGHT BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S OR THEY COULD BE DIFFERENT -- AND IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE DIFFERENT AND THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN PURSUING SOME THINKING THROUGH GETS PRIORITIES FOR THE PAID FAMILY LEAVE PROGRAM -- THE TASK FORCE AS PROPOSED IN THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS WERE. IN BODIES THAT ACTION AND THEREFORE WE WOULD GENERALLY BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE LEGISLATURE TAKING THOSE STEPS -- TO PURSUE ITS. OWN POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THE PROGRAM. DO YOU HAVE ANY. RESPONSE TO THAT -- THINK THOUGH IT WAS VERY THOUGHTFUL IN THEIR OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FINANCE HI A I'M AND AND JUST TO SPEAK TO LA OF POINTS -- WE PROVIDE IN AN EXEMPTION TO THE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS RELATED TO THE PFL EXPANSION -- MAINLY BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A LOW COST -- IT'S A LOW COST PROJECT -- IT'S IT'S BEEN A REALLY LOW THE LOW RISK -- THE DEPARTMENT HAS EXPERIENCE -- A CREATING OR IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES OF SYSTEM CHANGES AND AND AND TO THE EARLIEST POINT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM -- BUT THE JULY FIRST TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE -- AND I WE DO WANT. TO ADD THAT WE ALSO HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE STAFF ARE RECOMMENDED -- PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AS WE CANNOT SUPPORT AT SUPPORT AT THIS TIME OKAY. DO YOU HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS. OKAY SO OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE THE BUDGET PROPOSAL. ON AND OFF THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TONIGHT -- JUST ASK -- TRYING TO SEE WHERE I FIND IT HERE -- WITH THIS. WHERE WITH THE ISSUE OF -- WAGE REPLACEMENT. ON PAID FAMILY LEAVE WHEN AND HOW WITH WILL THAT BE DEALT WITH. IT'S THE ISSUE ITEM THAT I BELIEVE THAT THE TASK FORCE WILL EVENTUALLY TAKE UP -- AND IT'S BEING CONSIDERED AS WE SPEAK IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. OKAY SO THAT'S EXPLICITLY ON THIS OKAY THANK YOU I COULD FIND. ALRIGHT SO -- AGAIN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO APPROVE HIS BUDGET A PLACE HOLDER. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CAN I'VE MOTION. OKAY ROLL CALL PLEASE. SENATOR ASA HI. THERE NIELSEN ABSTAINED. CENTER I'M BURKE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MY EXTENSION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERN ABOUT. DEALING WITH THIS IN A TRAILER BILL RATHER THAN A FULL HEARING PROCESS IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE CONCERN THAT. AS WE WOULD EXTEND THESE KINDS OF LEAVES WE'RE GOING TO PUT A BURDEN ON THE BUDGET I'M AFRAID. NOT MAYBE NOW BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S MY RESERVATION AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS GOING TO SAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. OKAY WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE FORTY NINE HERE [inaudible] CALPERS [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. OKAY GO HEAD RIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER HARRIS WITH THE CALPERS FINANCIAL OFFICE. AS THIS AGENDA ITEM ITEM NOTES THIS IS BRINGING THE BUDGET BILL LINE ITEMS IN LINE WITH THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY CALPERS BUDGET AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION AS A SECOND READING ON MAY FIFTEENTH. TWENTY NINETEEN THE AMOUNTS REPRESENT INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES FOR ADMINISTRATIVE AND INVESTMENT OERATING COSTS AS WELL AS FOR EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR FEES [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] LA -- COMMENTS FINANCE NO COMMENT MEMBERS. YOUR CURRENT PUBLIC COMMENT. I HAVE A QUESTION -- OF FOR THESE AMOUNTS -- SAID MANAGEMENT FEES. INVESTMENT MANAGER BE SALARIES AND BENEFITS IN OPERATING COSTS. ARE THESE AMOUNTS. OF HOW DO YOU REACH THAT WE HOW HOW WHAT'S THE PROCESS OF DECIDING. EACH OF THOSE. ARE THEY JUST AN AUTOMATIC FOR EXAMPLE 2% NO MATTER WHAT. WHAT GOES INTO DECIDING EACH OF THESE ISSUES THAT ADD UP TO THE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX MILLION REFLECTS THE FUNDS FOR WHICH CALPERS HAS CONTINUOUS BUDGET AUTHORITY? AND WITHIN THE CALPERS BUDGET WE HAVE SIX EXPENDITURE CATEGORIES AND SO WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST IN OUT ANALYTICAL PROCESS TO DEVELOP EACH OF THOSE. WITHIN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS BUDGETS THAT SALARIES WAGES AND BENEFITS AN AWFULLY ANY COSTS FOR ALL THE BRANCHES WITHIN CALPERS. THE INCREASE IN THAT LINE ITEM REFLECTS ANTICIPATED GENERAL SALARY RETIREMENT INCREASES THAT WILL BE MADE THROUGH THE STATE'S COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS THIS NEXT UPCOMING YEAR. AS WELL AS SOME INVESTMENT CLASSIFICATIONS SALARY INCREASES APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF ADMINISTRATION. IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN INVESTMENT OPERATING COSTS ARE ALSO LOOKED AT ON A LINE BY LINE BASIS THEY REFLECT THINGS FOR SOFTWARE RELATED -- TO INVESTMENT DATA ANALYTICS AND THAT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ARE THEY ARE PROPOSED THROUGH THE BUDGET OFFICE APPROVED THROUGH THE EXECUTIVE TEAM AT CALPERS AND THEN TO THE BOARD. INVESTMENT EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT FEES REPRESENT AMOUNTS THAT CALPERS PAYS TO EXTERNAL PARTIES WITH WHOM IT. CONTRACTS TO MANAGE SPECIFIC PORTFOLIOS THOSE AMOUNTS ARE REALLY BASED ON WHERE WE THINK MARKET CONDITIONS WILL BE NEXT YEAR AND EXPECTED RETURNS. IT'S REALLY A A PLACE HOLDER -- OBVIOUSLY WE WE DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL WE DON'T KNOW -- WHERE OUR MARKET RETURNS WILL BE BUT IF IF THEY ARE IN LINE WITH SOME ANTICIPATED -- RETURNS AND GROWTH AND THAT'S WHAT WE THINK THEY WILL BE. THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES REPRESENT AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE WITHIN CONTRACTS FOR THIRD PARTIES TO MANAGE OUR HEALTH PROGRAMS -- OUR SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME PROGRAMS AND THAT CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER'S RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT BENEFIT TRUST PROGRAM -- SO FOR THOSE THERE ARE CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS BUILT INTO EACH CONTRACT -- BUT THE REST IS AS WELL I'LL EXPLAIN OKAY. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS NO. OKAY HEARING NONE CAME A MOTION TO APPROVE IS BUDGETED. SEVERAL CALL PLEASE SENATOR ALSO BY SENATOR NELSON -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- THIS IS ALSO FOR YOU RIGHT SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE GO AHEAD. GREAT SO AT THE END IT JANET DID A REALLY GREAT JOB EXPLAINING THIS ISSUE PROVIDING SOME SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PIECES SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY FIVE HEALTH -- CALPERS HAS BEEN THE STATE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING CONTRACTS BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE PUBLIC WHERE STATEWIDE. AND THE FEDERAL SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION -- BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN CALPERS WOULD ACTUALLY COLLECTED BOTH THE EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYER SHARE OF SOCIAL SECURITY TAXES DEPOSIT THAT INTO THE OLD AGE SURVIVORS INSURANCE FUND. AND THEN REMIT THE THE TAXES TO THE IRS AND IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT RESPONSIBILITY WAS TAKEN FROM US AND GIVEN TO THE IRS. WHEN THOSE TAXES WERE SITTING IN THE OLD AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE FUND THEY WERE EARNING INTEREST AND THOSE INTEREST AMOUNTS OR WHAT CALPERS HAS BEEN YOU UTILIZING FOR THE LAST THREE DECADES? THE COVER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH BEING THE STATE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATOR. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY THERE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT RESERVES TO COVER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PURSUANT TO EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY CALPERS CAN CHARGED FEES AND ASSESSMENTS TO EMPLOYERS TO COVER IT'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. STATURE REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO PROVE THE METHODOLOGY BY WHICH WE ASSESS THOSE FEES. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- BRINGS THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION OF THIRTY THAT WE HAVE FOR THIS FUND ON BUDGET AND IT ALSO CHANGES OF THE AMOUNT OF PENALTIES AND ADDS INTEREST THAT WE CAN CHARGE. WORD WERE -- PROPOSING THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE AS YET WE'VE NEVER CHARGED A FEE TO A PUBLIC EMPLOYER TO DO THIS WE'VE HAD ENOUGH FUNDS AND THAT RESIDUAL INTEREST TO COVER -- THEREFORE-WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE HOW SUCCESSFUL WILL BE IN COLLECTING BECAUSE NEARLY TWO THIRDS OF THE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE CONTRACTS WITH CALPERS THEIR NON CHALFORD CALPERS COVERED EMPLOYERS -- AND BECAUSE THE FEES ARE RELATIVELY LOW THE PENALTIES WERE VERY LOW AS WELL -- AND SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE ENCOURAGEMENT TO EMPLOYERS TO PAY IN A TIMELY MANNER. COMMENTARY QUESTIONS THE YEAR. A PUBLIC COMMENT. JUST ONE QUESTION ON THAT SINCE THEY EMPLOYERS MANY OF THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR YOU TO HAVE A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT TO ACTUALLY REQUIRE THEM. TO PAY. THESE INCREASED FEES -- I MEAN. WHAT IS YOUR CALCULATION IS IT THAT YOU EXPECTS A CERTAIN NUMBER WILL PAY THE INCREASED FEES AND THEREFORE THAT WILL MAKE UP FOR THOSE WHO DON'T PAY? NO WE WE WONDER HOW DO YOU. MY APOLOGIES -- WE WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT ALL WILL PAY -- BUT AGAIN. WE WE HAVE -- CONTRACTS FOR A PENSION SERVICES ARE PENSION BENEFITS WITH ROUGHLY EIGHT HUNDRED OF THE EMPLOYERS ALL OF THEM HAVE WHATARE CALLED SECTION TWO EIGHTEEN CONTRACTS BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION. SO WE HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IN THAT WAY AND WE DO MONITOR NO WHICH EMPLOYERS HAVE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES -- BUT TO THE FEE STRUCTURE -- SETS THE RATES N SUCH A WAY THAT WE ARE HOPEFUL TO COLLECT FROM ALL ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF BRINGING THIS ON BUDGET AND WITH THE PURVIEW OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT WE WILL ASSESS THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES THAT ARE IN THE FUND. AND IF WE FIND THAT THEIR RESERVES ARE GETTING TOO HIGH THEN WE WILL REDUCE THE FEE STRUCTURE [inaudible] OKAY. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY WAY OF REQUIRING ALL THE EMPLOYERS. A PRACTICAL WAY. NO I ASIDE FROM STATUTES SAYING THAT CALPERS HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CHARGE AN ASSESSMENT OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- COULD HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE HIS PROPOSED. THANK YOU SENATOR. ROLL CALL CENTER DRAWS A HIGH CENTER NIELSEN. CENTER ON BURKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE -- FIFTY ONE BE THE LAST. A CHANGE MY PHONE. NUMBER IS THIS [inaudible] YEAH NO [inaudible] YEAH. IF YOU DIDN'T TAKE SEVENTY SEVEN YOGA SO DISABILITY HELLO MY IS AND OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON. OF WELL DONE. AND THIS IS ON THE CENSUS OUT FREE -- SO PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT JUSTIN HOWARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA. GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY -- WITH ME IS THE DISCOGRAPHY THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA KLAY COUNT TWENTY TWENTY OFFICE -- BEFORE YOU TODAY. WE HAVE BROUGHT FORTH A PROPOSAL THAT IS BUILDING OFF OF OUR JANUARY TEMPLES ON WHICH WE ASK FOR A FIFTY FOUR MILLION IN GENERAL FUND WE TALKED ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL IN OUR LAST HEARING. ON THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU FOR IT WITH AND AS PART OF A MAY REVISE IS REQUESTING -- SEVERAL IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE A CENSUS COUNT -- TWENTY TWENTY SPECIFICALLY WE ARE REQUESTING TWO POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND AND OF THAT TWO POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND TWO MILLION OF THAT IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED FOR NATIVE AMERICAN. OUTREACH IS DIRECT OUT REACH TO NATIVE AMERICAN -- TRIBE -- MEMBERS -- AND ORGANIZATIONS SO PREVIOUSLY WE HAD PROVIDED -- FUNDING FOR NATIVE AMERICAN AT POPULATIONS AND IN TWO MANNERS ONE WAS DIRECT ALLOCATIONS TO TRIBAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY CAN CONDUCT OUTREACH WITHIN THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL SERVICE AREAS -- AS YOU AS YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON TRIBAL LANDS A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE ON TRIBAL LANDS IS ACTUALLY QUITE SMALL FOR THE BULK OF THE FUNDING THAT WE HAD PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED WENT -- TO THE ATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY CAN CONDUCT THE OUT REACH TO THOSE AT TRIBAL MEMBERS THAT DON'T LIVE ON THE TRIBAL LANDS -- WHAT WE'VE ALSO FOUND WAS IN HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR -- NATIVE AMERICAN AB PARTNERS WAS THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY UNIQUE IN NATURE THEY ARE SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS -- AND THEY ALL OPERATE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THERE AND VERY -- HARD TO REACH AREAS WITHIN THE STATE AND PREVIOUSLY WE HAD EXPECTED MANY OF OUR CONTRACTOR PARTNERS ARE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS COUNTY IS EXPECTED TO TRY TO ENGAGE. AND PROVIDE OUT REACH THROUGH THE MONEY THROUGH THE FUNDING THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THEM TO THIS THIS VERY IMPORTANT PART RELATION GROUP -- REALIZING THAT THAT IS NOW JUST TOO DIFFICULT TO DO GIVEN THE NATURE OF AND THE UNIQUENESS OF ALL THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ARE OUT THERE THE STATE IS NOW GOING TO DO THAT DIRECTLY. BY WORKING WITH THOSE SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT FOCUS IN THIS AREA INSTEAD OF HAVING THIS CONTRACTOR PARTNERS DO THAT. SO THEREFORE INSTEAD OF REDIRECTING THE RESOURCES THAT WE'VE ALREADY AT ALLOCATED AND PROMISED TO THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COUNTIES WE ARE NOW ASKING FOR THIS TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE THAT WE CAN DO THAT DIRECT WORK AND WE WILL WORK WITH THEM -- AND BY PROVIDING A SPECIFIC -- MEDIA -- DEDICATED NATIVE AMERICAN ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS THOSE ADDITIONAL OUTREACH SERVICES THE REMAINING PORTION OF THAT TWO POINT NINE MILLION IS REALLY FOR TWO THINGS ONE IS TO ALLOW THE STATE TO ACQUIRE -- THAT POLITICAL BATTLE EAKES -- TOOL WHICH IS REALLY A CANVASSING TOOL THAT ALLOWS US TO TRACK ON HAD WHERE OUR PARTNERS ARE GOING TO GO ON A DOOR TO DOOR BASIS WHEN THEY START DOING THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD -- WE'RE GOING TO ACQUIRE THAT TOOL AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO ALL OF OUR CONTRACTOR PARTNERS THAT WE WE STANDARDIZE WHAT'S BEING USED THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AS WELL AS STANDARDIZE THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED SO THAT WE CAN UPLOAD IT INTO OUR STATEWIDE OUT REACHING RAPID DEPLOYMENT TOOL WHICH WILL THEN ALLOW US TO ANALYZE HOW THINGS ARE GOING INTO THE SPECIALLY AS WE GET ARE. A REAL TIME DATA FROM THE US CENSUS BUREAU AND TO THAT END THE OTHER PIECE OF THAT IS A POSSESS FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN GET ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION TO DO THAT BUNCH OF STATISTICAL. DATA ANALYSIS ESTABLISH THOSE METRICS AND SUCCESSES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING -- FOR RELATED TO THE DATA SO THAT WE KNOW WHERE TO TARGET OUR FUNDING COM THAT CRITICAL PERIOD AS WE HOLD BACK SOME OF THE FUNDS FOR DEPLOYMENT DURING THE CRUCIAL NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD. ON AND FINALLY THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO LANGUAGE REQUEST THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET -- ONE OF IS JUST OF MORE OF A TECHNICAL -- LANGUAGE RELATED TO THIS CLARIFYING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS THE AUTHORITY -- TO RECALL -- THE POINT ALL THE POSITIONS THE CENSUS OFFICE -- AS EXAM POSITIONS THE OTHER ONE A LITTLE BIT MORE IMPORTANT IS IS REALLY BUDGET FLEXIBILITY LANGUAGE SO WHAT WE FOUND -- AND TALKING TO ALL OUR STAKEHOLDER GROUPS OUT THERE WHO ARE REQUESTING A SIGNIFICANT -- FUNDING TO BE AUGMENTED TO THE CENSUS EFFORTS AS WE JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FUNDING IS ACTUALLY NEEDED AT THE END OF THE DAY TO DO A COMPLETE AND SUCCESSFUL COUNT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN ACTUALLY TELL YOU THAT. WE KNOW WE HAVE ENOUGH TO DO IN REACH EVERYONE BUT THE THE BIG QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE FREQUENCY OF THAT OUT REACH THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE HOW MANY IMPRESSIONS DO WE NEED TO DO TO THOSE INDIVIDUAL. HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS AS IT. TWO TIMES TEN TIMES A HUNDRED TIMES NO ONE CAN ACTUALLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND UNTIL OVER THE SUMMER AS WE WORK ON OUR CATION PLANS FOR ALL OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS WERE PROVIDING MONEY FOR WE CAN'T ACTUALLY TELL YOU EXACTLY WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY GAPS IN ANY OF OUR OUTREACH. MEANING IS THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR LANGUAGE SERVICES IS THERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR COMMUNITY EVENTS AS OUR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES NEEDED FOR THE NON RESPONSE FOLLOW UP PERIOD. THAT INFORMATION UNFORTUNATELY WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL WE GET INTO THE LATTER HALF OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COME BACK AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE'RE LANGUAGE. THAT ALLOWS US AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO AUGMENT OUR BUDGET THROUGH THE JAIL BC REQUEST -- SHOULD WE IDENTIFY THOSE GAPS AFTER WE COMPLETE OUR PLANNING PROCESS. AND I GUESS I WAS REMISS ONE LETTER LAST TECHNICAL THING THAT'S INCLUDED AS ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR REIMBURSEMENT AUTHORITY THAT'S REALLY RELATED TO THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING POPULATION SAMPLE. ENUMERATION THIS IS THE THE BASICALLY A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO ALLOW US TO SPEND THE MONEY THAT'S COMING TO US FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE CENSUS OFFICES ACTUALLY. CARRYING THE CONTRACT AS PART OF THE FIFTY FOUR MILLION WE HAD REQUESTED FOR MILLION FINANCES EXISTING FUNDING OF A MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY ARE CHIPPING AND FOR PART OF THIS -- PROGRAM AND WE NEED THE ABILITY HAS BEEN THAT FUNDING ONCE THEY SEND IT OVER TO OUR OFFICE SO -- WITH THAT AND AND THE DIRECTOR AND ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE RELATED TO THE CENSUS EFFORTS AT THE STATE. THANK YOU. LA -- FINANCE NOW. MEMBERS SUMMIT PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE.

FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SECTORS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE PREVIOUSLY -- SUBMITTED A LETTER RECOMMENDING ADD AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY EDUCATIONAL SECTORS WHILE THE FUNDING THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO THIS OF SECTOR WE KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR US TO BE ABLE TO REACH ALL OF THE SCHOOLS. THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY EIGHTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY HALF OF THAT FUNDING WILL GO TO LA U. S. D.. THE REST WILL GO TO THE OTHER SEVENTY NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THE STATE'S LARGEST REGIONAL EDUCATION AGENCY FAMILIAR WITH PROVIDING REGIONAL SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY. WE THINK IT'S A WISE INVESTMENT TO PROVIDE FUNDING AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SCHOOL WITHIN TWENTY FIVE OF THE MOST HARD TO COUNT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTY AND IN THE STATE. AS WE KNOW SO WE THINK THAT WOULD BE THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES IN ADDITION. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION HAS ALSO REQUESTED A CERTAIN STAFF TO ALSO ADDRESS THE NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COUNTY OURSELVES WE ARE PREPARED TO DO THAT WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT. BUT WE TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AS WE KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATORS TO BECAUSE YOU'RE HEARING THIS ITEM ONE OF THE THINGS WE THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT. IS THAT WE KNOW IT CHILDREN COME TO SCHOOL WITH THEIR PARENTS THIS IS THE MOST REASONABLE PLACE TO PUT RESOURCES AND WE'RE PREPARED TO ASSIST WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT ON THAT MATTER WE ALSO SUPPORT THE ADMINISTRATION'S REQUEST. FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING ON THE IN THE FUTURE AS A TAKE ASSESSMENTS -- THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF NON PROFITS AND ALONG WITH OUR TEN THOUSAND A MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PART OF OUR POLICY LINE'S WANNA A LINE ARE REMARKS WITH THOSE OTHERS FROM THE PAN. AND THANK THE CHAIR AND STAFF -- AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR ALL OF THE EFFORTS WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AT KNOWING THAT HOW MUCH THE CENSUS COUNT MATTERS AND HOW CHALLENGING -- THIS THE ENVIRONMENT IS AND CALIFORNIA'S NONPROFITS AS HER FILLED WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS WHO ARE MORE THAN PREPARED TO ENGAGE IN THIS AND UNDER A SOURCING THEM WOULD BE A MISTAKE SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR CREATIVITY -- IN YOUR-SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR CBO OUTRAGE THANK YOU. NO I BOTTOM ALL REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. ON BEHALF OF OUR IMMIGRANT MIGRANT FARM WORKER AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE STAND THE LINE WITH OUR PARTNERS AT C. PAN WITH THE COMMENTS THEY GAVE. AND WE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I JUST WANNA. JUST AS A FINANCIAL COMMENT -- POINT OUT AN ARTICLE THAT SAID. TWENTY FOUR CENSUS OFFICES ARE BEING CUT IN CALIFORNIA -- SO I THINK THAT SHOULD POINT TO HOW WE HAVE TO MAKE UP -- FOR THE LACK OF YOU KNOW FOCUS THAT THAT THE STATE NEEDS AS FAR AS THE CENSUS IS CONCERNED BUT I EIGHT DO THINK. THAT IT'S IMPORTANT. TO WE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF HEARINGS AND MEETINGS ABOUT THE SENSES -- I THINK HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY BELIEVES THE SENSES IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SHOULD MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT -- BUT I DO BELIEVE HAVING SPENT SO MANY YEARS OF MY LIFE WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THAT THAT. OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO REGION TO THESE HARD TO COUNT -- AREAS AND NEIGHBORHOODS A WITHIN THE LANGUAGE ACCESS THAT. WE JUST DON'T HAVE AS THE AS THE GOVERNMENT. AS A FORMAL INSTITUTION DOES EXIST OUT THERE I'VE SEEN IT ALL FOR EXAMPLE IN COMMUNITIES OF INDIGENOUS GROUPS FROM MEXICO THERE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT NOBODY WOULD KNOW OTHERWISE AND THEY SPEAK VERY SPECIFIC DIALECTS BUT THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT CAN REACH THEM. I'VE SEEN THAT. SO I AM A BIG BELIEVER IN. USING THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S OUT THERE THROUGH THE CBO'S I DO AGREE -- WITH THE COMMENT FROM THE EDUCATE AT OFFICE OF EDUCATION THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE ON INFRASTRUCTURE. WE MAY NOT HAVE SUPERMARKETS IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT WE HAVE A SCHOOL IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD AND PARENTS THERE GO TO THOSE SCHOOLS. SO I WOULD URGE ASSUMING WE CAN GET THE RESOURCES THAT WE NEED THAT. THE EDGES OF OUR EDUCATION OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS PARTNER WITH C. B. O.'S TO GET -- THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REACH EVERYBODY. IN THIS SHOULD BE ON ALL OF US IT SHOULD BE A NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BECAUSE WE WON'T FACE THIS PRIORITY FOR ANOTHER TEN YEARS -- SO WITH ALL OF THAT -- THEM. MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THIS [inaudible] YES -- THIS IS THIS IS OBVIOUSLY ONE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING HERE IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OR SO. AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE THE RIGHT FOLKS TO LEAVE THE OPERATION -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THIS CATEGORY FOR COMING BY MS JOHNSON FOR COMING BY MY OFFICE YESTERDAY DISCUSS. OF CERTAIN CONCERNS THAT I HAVE. WE VIEW OUR JOBS JUST THROUGH OUR LIMITEDEXPERIENCE IN THE PRISM OF OUR EXPERIENCE WITH WHATEVER TASK WE'RE DEALING WITH -- FOR US AN ORANGE COUNTY. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH CHERNOBYL VENTURES AND AFTER OUR MEETING YESTERDAY I REACHED OUT TO OTHERS INCLUDING A LEGISLATORS JUST TO SEE -- VENTURES IS THE ORGANIZATION THIS PAST WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING THE PLAN AND REACHING OUT TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN ORANGE COUNTY SO THAT WE CAN DO A COMPLETE JOB OF OF COUNTING ALL THOSE THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN -- FEEDBACK I'VE GOTTEN NOT SURPRISINGLY IS THAT THAT THEY ARE NON RESPONSIVE IN RESISTANCE. TO PARTICIPATING. AND SO -- AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I I REACHED OUT AFTER HEARING THESE COMMENTS FROM -- SEPARATE UP MYSELF I'VE NOT HEARD BACK AFTER A PHONE CALL AND EMAIL. SO OBVIOUSLY THAT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROJECT ON HIS FOCUS MY ATTENTION ON ORANGE COUNTY. AND SO I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING HOW WE'RE GOING TO REMEDIATE THAT WHETHER WE TERMINATE YOUR OF VENTURES. ON HOW WE CAN WHAT THE IMPACTS WOULD BE THAT KIND OF THING. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING GIVEN HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE SPENDING ON THIS PROJECT AND HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO REALLY DEVELOP. ACCURATE METRICS TO KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT. EFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVELY ACCOUNTABILITY IS IS TO HAVE METRICS HARD TO DEVELOP METRICS BECAUSE THIS IS A PROJECT WHERE. THE ONLY METRIC IS WE'LL KNOW NEXT APRIL OR MAY WHETHER OR NOT WE'VE DONE A GOOD JOB. IN THE INTERIM IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE ACCOUNTABLE AND I KNOW YOU I I'M I'M PREACHING THE CHOIR BECAUSE I KNOW YOU YOU KNOW ALL THIS BUT BUT I AM CONCERNED BECAUSE MY ONE BRIEF. SORT OF OBSERVATION INTERACTION -- WITH OUR OWN ORGANIZATION. WAS -- BOB. WAS HORRIBLE SO -- I DON'T ONE EXTRAPOLATE TO OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE BUT I WOULD LIKE IT'S SOME POINT TIME TO THE NEXT YOU KNOW SEVERAL DAYS TO HEAR WHAT WE CAN DO. TO DEAL WITH THAT SITUATION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT CENTER AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THAT FEEDBACK BECAUSE IT HADN'T MADE IT UP TO ME -- UNTIL WE SPOKE -- JUST YESTERDAY AND I WANT ENCOURAGE OTHERS THAT ARE IN THE FIELD TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GETTING THAT FEEDBACK BACK BECAUSE YOU SHOULD BE ABLE. TO GET THE RESPONSES THAT YOU NEED IT WE ARE PRIDE OURSELVES ON A TRANSPARENT. AND INCLUSIVE PROCESS AND IF FRANKLY IF YOUR OFFICE IS INVOLVED AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IN THAT AREA THAT DOESN'T BODE WELL AS YOU SAY SO. A WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING TOGETHER WITH OUR TEAM AND OTHERS TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO ANY TO ADDRESS DOWN THERE -- BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ON THE MEASURE BULLS AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE BIT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU DO IT LIKE OUTRAGE THERE'S AN OUT REACH FOR DIFFERENT THINGS WITH YOUR GETTING THEM SIGN UP FOR HEALTH INSURANCE ARE YOU GETTING THEM TO VOTE. FOR CENSUS IS REALLY SPECIFIC UP FOR ME AT LEAST AND HOW TARGET NEEDS TO BE YOU CAN DO ALL THE EVENTS THAT YOU HAVE YOU CAN KNOCK ON DOORS. BUT IF WE DON'T ALLOW ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY FILL OUT THAT FORM. THEN WE LOSE WE ALL LOSE RIGHT IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU DO ALL THIS VOTER OUR REACH BUT THE NOBODY HAS A POLLING PLACE TO GO. RIGHT SO WE E. AS A SORT OF A AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL NEED TO BE REALLY TARGETING AND UNDERSTANDING. WHAT ARE WE DOING TO BUILD THOSE AREAS WHETHER THEIR MOBILE QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS I THINK -- SIR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WAS POINTED OUT WAS THAT THE US CENSUS BUREAU IS NO LONGER GOING TO HAVE QUESTION YOUR ASSISTANCE CENTERS BRICKS AND MORTAR THAT'S A HUGE YOU KNOW COMPARING TWO THOUSAND TO A HUGE ISSUE. SO THAT'S DEFINITELY AN AREA THAT WE HAVE CONSIDERED AND WE HAVE ASKED OUR CONTRACTORS COUNTIES AND CBO'S WE'VE INCLUDED IN THEIR MIND AT HIGHLIGHTED IN BRIGHT YOU KNOW READ. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT CONSIDERING THAT IF OUR CONTRACTORS ARE NOT CONSIDERING THE VERY FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ACCESS. THEN THAT'S A PROBLEM THEN -- YOU. SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE ADDING MORE AND MORE YOU KNOW -- REQUIREMENTS ON TO OUR CONTRACTORS. YOU KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IT'S A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY -- AND IF OUR CULTURE TO SAY OH YOU DIDN'T TELL US EXACTLY WHAT TO DO AND SO NOW YOU KNOW WHERE I CAN HAVE THE BE ABLE ABILITY INDEPENDENT THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC. AND SO KNOWING THAT IF THERE'S CONTRACTORS WE HAVE OUT THERE THAT ARE LIKE. NOT GETTING BACK TO AND BEING TRANSPARENT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IF THERE'S CONTRACTORS ARE SAYING WE DIDN'T ASK ME TO DO THAT. IT IS SPECIFICALLY DOWN TO THE LETTER SO I'M NOT GOING TO IT THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT. BECAUSE OF OUR YOU KNOW IF EVERYONE IS ON BOARD WITH GETTING EVERYONE COUNTED LEVEL ON THE PEOPLE THAT WERE ACTUALLY GIVING MONEY TO THAT WANT MORE MONEY TO DO MORE THINGS. WITHOUT YET TELLING US EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO I NEED TO KNOW WHEN I NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE. THAT THESE CONTRACTORS ACTUALLY KNOW WHERE THEY'RE HARD TO COUNT OUR RATE AND THEY KNOW HOW TO GET TO THEM SO I APPRECIATE THAT FEEDBACK AND WE'RE GONNA GET BACK TO A PARTICULAR ON THE ISSUE THAT WE MET WITH YOU YESTERDAY. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO ENCOURAGE ALL YOUR COLLEAGUES LET US KNOW WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TO I MEAN WE'RE WE GET FEEDBACK YOU KNOW WE ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWELVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND. ACROSS THE STATE ARE WE LOVE TO HEAR THE EYES AND EARS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT ACCOUNTABILITY -- BUT YOU GUYS OUR EYES AND EARS AND SO ARE YOUR STAFF SO WE ARE DEFINITELY OPEN TO THAT. WHAT? AND THAT'S THE REASON REACHED OUT TO OTHERS YESTERDAY. IF THEY'RE NOT RESPONDING TO THE CHAIR OF THE SENSES COMMITTEE -- IT NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY'RE NOT REACHING OUT OR OR BEING RESPONSIVE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTY. I DON'T WANT TO BE I'M A BELIEVER THIS POINT BUT WHAT WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I'M GONNA VOTE BY ON THIS RECOMMENDATION BUT I'M A ASK THAT THIS BE -- BASICALLY -- DOG THROUGH THE PROCESS THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND SO FORTH BECAUSE AGAIN THIS IS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING AND WE HAVE TO HAVE ACCOUNTABLE IN TRANSPARENCY. THANK YOU. ABSOLUTELY SENATOR. NOTHING MORE -- OKAY AND I I WOULD ENCOURAGE JUST THEN -- TO SUPPORT THIS -- I HEAR YOU SAYING ABOUT YOU KNOW EXACTLY SURE WHERE. WHAT SOME OF THESE THINGS WILL KNOWING START UNTIL YOU START DOING THEM? I'D RATHER YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES. OUGHT TO DO THIS AND NOT. BE CUT SHORT WITHOUT THE RESOURCES SO -- I I HAVE A LOT OF TRUST AND FAITH IN A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO GOOD WORK OUT THERE. I WAS PART OF DOING A WORK AROUND THE COVERED CALIFORNIA THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND ALL THE WORK THAT HAD TO BE DONE TO DO OUT WE CAN. TO YOU KNOW COMMUNITIES THAT NEEDED THAT BUT OR HARD TO HARD TO REACH -- I KNOW THERE'S WAYS. AND HOW MANY I KNOW THIS A FORMULAS ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO GO IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU DO VOTER TURNOUT. I KNOW IN CERTAIN COMMUNITIES HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE TO GO TO BE ABLE TO GET THOSE -- VOTERS TO THE POLLS SO OF THIS MAY BE EASE. AND PARTIALLY UNIQUE BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES YOU NEED TO HAVE THE FEEDBACK YOU NEED TO HAVE THE HELP. BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET INTO OUR RURAL AREAS AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO GET TO SOME NEIGHBORHOOD IN A BIG CITY LIKE LA. WE'VE GOT WE'VE GOT TO DO BOTH SO WITH THAT -- THERE'S NO MORE. PUBLIC WHERE WOULD HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT -- THE OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION -- APPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND AUGMENT OUT REACH CUP FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS.
