AND WITH THAT WE WILL BEGIN THE HEARINGS- I WANT TO WELCOME OUR SPECIAL APPOINTEE TO THE SPECIAL TWENTIES TO THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES- SENATORS MINUTE NUMBER WELCOME I THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AS WELL AS- SIX SENATOR LAYERED IN OUR STEAM FORMER SECRETARY HERE- WHO'S WHO'S ON HAND WE'RE ALSO INTENDING TO HAVE I THINK. A FEW MORE MEMBERS JOIN US OUR VICE CHAIR AND. POTENTIALLY MAJORITY LEADER SHORTLY. I BUT WE'LL GET STAR HERE. WITH A FEW OPENING COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL START DIGGING INTO TESTIMONY- AS A RECAP ON OCTOBER FIRST IN THE EVENING. THERE WERE REPORTS- IN THE LATE AFTERNOON EVENING OF AN OIL SHEEN OFFSHORE HUNTINGTON BEACH. IT WAS STARTING TO COME IN THE NEXT MORNING AT NINE AM A PIPELINE LEAK WAS OFFICIALLY REPORTED BY THE OPERATOR OF THAT PIPELINE AMPLIFY ENERGY. THEN THE OIL SPILL RESPONSE BEGAN IN EARNEST- ABLE FI HAS CHIPPED CHOSEN NOT TO ACCEPT THE INVITATION OF THE COMMITTEE TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY AND WILL BE ADDRESSING- SOME OF THOSE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS FROM AMPLIFY AS WE PROCEED HERE. BUT THE PIPELINE THAT RUNS TO AMPLIFY AND COPIED OFF SHORES PLATFORM KELLY IS THE SOURCE OF THE OIL PRODUCTION THAT RUNS THROUGH THE PIPELINE IN QUESTION. THAT SURE THAT THAT PIPELINE IS A FEDERAL IN FEDERAL JURISDICTION BUT IT BRINGS THAT PRODUCED OIL ONSHORE INTO STATE WATERS AND EVENTUALLY ON STATE LANDS. I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUT THERE RESPONDING TO THE SPILL- WE WENT DOWN TO THE SIDE- OUT ONTO THE AIRCRAFT WORKING TALKING WITH COAST GUARD OSCAR L. E. S. CDFW RESOURCES PARKS. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY VIGILANT AS WELL AS THE ARMY OF VOLUNTEERS WHO SHOWED UP TO HELP OUT AND ALL THE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED- THE NEWS THIS MORNING WAS THAT SBA LOANS ARE NOW GOING TO BE OFFERED SOME OF THOSE BUSINESSES BUT THEY HAVE CERTAINLY NOT BEEN MADE WHOLE FOR THE LOSSES THEY EVEN TOURED. NOR IS OUR ENVIRONMENT- AS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN THOUGH INTO. A SURFER AND SOMEBODY LOVES THOSE WATERS WITH ALL MY HEART I DO APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE- BUT WE WILL DIG INTO WHAT WENT WELL WHAT DIDN'T GO WELL WHAT WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE OUR EFFORTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS. THE LONGER TERM LIABILITIES OF HAVING ACTIVE OIL PRODUCTION OFF THE SHORE OF CALIFORNIA ON A SENSITIVE COASTLINE AMIDST PLENTY OF SHIP TRAFFIC AND OTHER USES AND TRY TO GET OUR HEADS AROUND- HOW TO ACTUALLY MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CLIMATE AGENDA- THAT. MAKES THE TRANSITION AND BEGINS TO END THESE PRACTICES- TO THE COASTAL ECONOMY IS ESTIMATED TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY. AND A LOT OF THOSE COMPONENTS ACTUALLY DEPEND ON A SHORELINE THAT IS FREE FROM POLLUTION INCIDENTS AND THIS OTHER KIND OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY THAT LIMITS OUR- ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE COAST AND ALL THE RESOURCES IT OFFERS OFTEN THOSE NUMBERS ARE QUANTIFIED. AND THE VALUE OF. DRILLING MAY BE. EXAGGERATED IN PROPORTION TO THE THAT IT PROVIDES THE PUBLIC BUT- WE'RE LOOKING HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE FOR WHAT THOSE LIABILITIES ARE- AND WHAT A FRAMEWORK COULD BE. NOT JUST TO ADDRESS THOSE BUT HOW WE CAN PREPARE AND RESPOND BETTER IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY THIS WILL PROBABLY NOT BE. THE LAST TIME WE'VE HEARD OF AN INCIDENT SUCH AS THIS- AND TO BE CLEAR. THE INDUSTRY AND IN THIS CASE AMPLIFYING THE OTHER PARTIES RESPONSIBLE MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND PAY TO MAKE THE PUBLIC AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL. AND FOOD NOTION OF COMPANIES OUT THERE GOING BANKRUPT OR FINDING SOME OTHER LEGAL MECHANISM TO EVADE RESPONSIBILITY. BELIES THE PUBLIC TRUST AND UNDERCUTS OUR ENTIRE. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK- SO WE'LL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WE GO ON BUT TODAY WILL FOCUS MOSTLY ON THE RESPONSE EFFORT- AND SOME OF THE DETAILS THERE WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S STILL AN ACTIVE ONGOING INVESTIGATION UNDER WAY AND SO WE MAY NOT GET EVERY ANSWER WE'RE LOOKING FOR HERE TODAY BUT- I THINK THE MAIN MESSAGE OUGHT TO BE THAT. IF T. AS LONG AS THE- HEROES LONG AS THE CLEANUP IS STILL GOING WE'RE GOING TO BE DIGGING INTO THAT. BUT EVEN WHEN IT'S COMPLETE THE WORK IS NOT DONE- SO I WANTED. TO PASS THE MICHAEL OVER TO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS WHO WISH TO MAKE SOME OPENING COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM T. MINISTRATION OUR FIRST PANEL- INTERMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR STERN- I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY SEVEN WHICH INCLUDES THE LOWER HALF OF HUNTINGTON BEACH- THIS NEWPORT BEACH LAGUNA BEACH I BELIEVE MY DISTRICT HAS THE FINEST BEACHES IN THE COUNTRY- SO AMAZING BEAUTIFUL- PRESERVES COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS THAT PROTECT. MANY SPECIES INCLUDING ENDANGERED SPECIES OF BIRDS AND OTHER- FLORA AND FAUNA THAT- ARE IMPORTANT- IN TWO HERE ON OCTOBER SECOND THAT THIS WAS ALL BEING ENDANGERED BY A MASSIVE OIL SPILL I WAS WAS DISCONCERTING TO SAY THE LEAST. NOW I FIRST AND FOREMOST WANNA TANK UNIFIED COMMAND THE U. S. COAST GUARD OSCAR DEPARTMENT AFICIONADOS AND I KNOW WE HAVE SOME REPRESENTATIVES FROM SOME OF THOSE AGENCIES TESTIFYING TODAY OFFER THEY'RE QUICK AND DECISIVE RESPONSE WHICH I THINK REALLY PREVENTED THIS FROM BEING MUCH WORSE THAN IT COULD HAVE BEEN I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO HUNTINGTON BEACH AND ORANGE COUNTY- WHO ALSO QUICKLY DEPLOYED A LOT OF BLOOMS A LOT OF PERSONNEL. AND I KNOW IT THAT PROTECTED US SOME OF OUR ECOLOGICAL PRESERVES- PLACES LIKE BOLSA CHICA- THE WETLANDS THAT- COULD HAVE REALLY BEEN SUFFERED FROM MUCH MORE DEVASTATION THAN THEY DID- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE ENDED UP WITH A FAR SMALLER OIL SPILL THAN ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED THAT WAS CONTAINED MUCH MORE THAN THAN WE- I THINK EVEN OUR BEST- BUT MOST OPTIMISTIC OUT EXPECTATIONS WERE- WE STILL CLOSED ON OUR BEACHES FOR NEARLY TWO WEEKS WE'RE STILL GOING TO CLEAN THIS UP FOR WEEKS AND WEEKS. AT SOME POINT WE HAVE TO ASK IS OFFSHORE DRILLING WORTH IT- THE RISKS THAT SEEM OMNIPRESENT THAT JEOPARDIZE A COASTAL ECONOMY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR BY SOME ESTIMATES- A COASTAL- BECAUSE A COASTLINE THAT NOT ONLY GENERATES SO MUCH REVENUE FOR US BUT IS PART OF WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIANS. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT CALIFORNIA M. PEOPLE FROM AROUND WORLD THINK CAL THEY THINK ABOUT. OUR BEACHES ARE CO- WE ARE KNOWN FOR THAT. IT'S PART OF WHO WE ARE WITH YOUR SERVER FOR. MY KIDS GO BOOGIE BOARDING EVERY OTHER WEEKEND OR JUST WALKING ON THE COASTLINE AND ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS. THIS IS A PART OF WHO WE ARE AND THE OIL THAT IS GENERATED- THAT IS EXTRACTED EACH YEAR OFF OF CALIFORNIA WATERS WHETHER IN FEDERAL OR STATE WATERS. ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ZERO POINT 3% OF OIL PRODUCTION ANNUALLY. IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT'S NOT EVEN A DROP IN THE BUCKET AND YET WE CONTINUALLY FACE THIS THREAT OF OIL SPILLS. AS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS AGING. AS IT JUST SEEMS INEVITABLE IN AND AS THEY SAY WHERE THERE'S DRILLING THERE'S GOING TO BE SPILLING AND UNFORTUNATELY MY DISTRICT FACED THAT- ADAGE EARLIER THIS MONTH AND SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS HEARING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED THE TIMELINE AROUND WHAT HAPPENED- BUT ALSO TO TRY TO DRILL DOWN AND SEE WHAT CAN WE DO O STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING. AND I RENOUNCE THAT I BELONG SO MY COLLEAGUES HERE WILL BE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION WHEN WE REOPEN IN JANUARY. TO END ALL SPOT FOR DRILLING EXTRACTION INCLUDING UNDER CURRENT LEASES IN STATE WATERS. BUT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THIS IS OUT OF OUR CONTROL IN FEDERAL WATERS. WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP THIS TERROR THAT WE CONSTANTLY FACE FROM OIL SPILLS. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE STRANGERS. STERN I LOOK FOR THE WITNESSES. THANK YOU CENTER. MEMBERS AND OTHER OPENINGS ON. SO NUMBER. THANK YOU SIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE IMPACTING CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT- I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR INCLUDING US IN THIS HEARING I REPRESENT THE OTHER PART OF HUNTINGTON BEACH- SEAL BEACH AND LONG BEACH AND I WILL DO A COMPARISON AS TO WHICH PART OF THE BEACH IS BETTER IN ANY EVENT I I'M GRATEFUL FOR BEING INCLUDED AND I'M ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR MEN MER KERR AND OTHER LEADERS IN ORANGE COUNTY ULTIMATELY WE'RE ACCOUNTABLE. WE THE ELECTED LEADERS WHETHER IT'S LOCAL OR STATE OR FEDERAL- WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR INSURING THAT THIS KIND OF EVENT IS PREVENTED IN THE FUTURE AND WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT GOD FORBID SOMETHING LIKE THIS SHOULD HAPPEN IT IS CONTAINED AND CLEANED UP AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- I KNOW SENATOR MEN WAS ON SITE FOR MANY MANY DAYS EARLY AND OFTEN- THE CAR WAS ON SITE. SHE PROBABLY REMAINS ON SITE WE WENT DOWN THERE TO BOTH AN AERIAL TOUR AS WELL AS A PHYSICAL TOUR GOT THE ACTUAL OIL ON OUR HANDS BY THE WAY IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET OFF IN THIS DEGRADATION HAS AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY HAS AN IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE HAS AN IMPACT ON THE LIVELIHOODS OF MANY MANY MANY FOLKS SO I AM WELCOMING THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE HOW WE CAN CONTAIN AND CLEAN UP AND HOW WE RESPOND TO THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY IN THE FUTURE- CINNAMON IS CORRECT. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF FIRST RESPONDERS A NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY AND VERY POWERFULLY BUT I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER I THINK WE CAN DO BETTER AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT SO THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN STERN FOR GIVING US THIS OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU SARAH BURKE CENTER LATER THANK YOU AND- I WOULD LIKE TO- AS THE PERSON THAT REPRESENTS THE- BEACHES WITH THE ELEPHANT SEALS INCENSE SIMEON AND OCEANIA AND THE MONTEREY PENINSULA AND THE NORTH COAST OF SANTA CRUZ. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR- BURKE FOR DPD DEFUSING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FINEST BEACHES. IT AND- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING AND I REALLY THANK THE COMMITTEE THE CHAIR. OF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER. WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY WE HAVE THE HORRIFIC SPILL THAT WAS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WITH BROKEN PIPELINE BUT A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED IN THE RESPONSE THAT WILL BE TESTIFYING AT THIS HEARING WERE INVOLVED IN THAT RESPONSE. IN OUR- IF YOU ARE JUST. ATTACH MYSELF TO THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR MEN ABOUT THE LONG TERM ISSUES HERE AND WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AND- I WOULD JUST REMIND. OUR PEOPLE AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS AN ACTIVIST ON THESE ISSUES IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES THAT THEY'RE STILL TWENTY SIX ORDINANCES. THAT WE WERE THE IMPETUS FOR IN THOSE YEARS. WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT SAID ON SHORE SUPPORT ACILITIES SONIC CHANGES CAN'T BE APPROVED WITHOUT A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE OF ART OF THAT JURISDICTION. AND IT WAS TO ACTUALLY MAKE SURE. THAT THERE WAS SAFETY OR THOSE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT ARE AT ISSUE IN THIS COMMITTEE. AT PLAY WHEN THAT HAPPENS AND SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSIONS AND THE PANELS AND GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE SOME KIND OF ACTION OR AT LEAST HAVE AN INFLUENCE OR WHAT WE'RE DOING IN GENERAL OUT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING. THANK YOU A LAYER- MR VICE CHAIR DID YOU WANNA. THIS IS YOU KNOW A COUPLE THINGS YOU KNOW I'M I'M AGAIN I'M I WOULD ECHO MY- COLLEAGUE'S COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND ALWAYS KIND OF. PUT TOGETHER ON SHORT NOTICE AND BUT I THINK IT'S THE TIMING IS GOOD- YOU KNOW I'M ALSO IS A STRONG CONSERVATIONISTS AND- I'M DISAPPOINTED IN AND HEARTBROKEN TO HEAR HOW MANY DIFFERENT SPECIES INCLUDING BIRDS AND FISH HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THIS OIL SPILL. IN ADDITION AS A HAS BEEN MENTIONED THE DENTRO IMPACTS ON NATURE OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY. HAS SUFFERED IMMENSELY AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND OUR BECAUSE THIS BILL HOW WE CAN. PREVENT FUTURE ONES. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION LOOKING INTO THIS- BUT- PRELIMINARY REPORTING LINKS THE CAUSE TO A BOAT ANCHOR. WHICH IS OUT OF THE OIL COMPANIES CONTROL SO IT'S GOING TO BE I LIKE TO SEE HOW THAT IS GONNA BE MITIGATED IN THE FUTURE. AND WHAT POLICIES- YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN IN CALIFORNIA IN THE STATE THAT'S CAUSING THIS BACK UP. OF ALL THESE CONTAINER SHIPS OFF THE COAST THERE WE GO. BECAUSE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY CAUSES PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL COME UP IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ON US. AS THIS NATURISTS WAS CAN YOU LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE WHILE THOSE SHIPS OR- OFFSHORE THEY'RE BURNING OIL. BURNING DIESEL TO KEEP THEIR LIGHTS ON KEEP THE MOTORS RUNNING. AND YOU KNOW. CALIFORNIA'S A LOT OF WORK IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TRYING TO LOWER THOSE EMISSIONS. FROM THE SHIP'S WHEN THEY'RE IN PORT SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WHITE WHY IS THE PARTS BACKED UP AND HELP CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. AND WILL SURELY THE OIL COMPANY HAS SOME RESPONSIBILITY IN THE MATTER. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US NOT TO PUSH ALL THE BLAME ON THE INDUSTRY BEFORE KNOWING ALL THE FACTS. AND WE MUST NOT LET BIASES IMPEDE OUR INVESTIGATION AND QUESTIONING OF THE SITUATION. AND WHEN I SAY WE I MEAN US AS A COMMITTEE BUT ALSO AS THE PROFESSIONALS. IN THIS IN THE STATE. OF IRAQ OR SEASON THE FEDERAL BROKERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE INVESTIGATIONS- I'M HOPEFUL THAT. YOU KNOW WE WOULD. HELP THEM NOT GET IN THEIR WAY SO THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THAT MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WE WILL PROCEED TO OUR FIRST PANEL- WE COULD. CALL UP OUR FIRST WITNESSES AS MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET- MR WILSHIRE WITH AMPLIFIED WAS- WAS INVITED TO TESTIFY- THEY HAVE DECLINED THAT INVITATION AND- DID SEND A LETTER WHICH WE CAN DISCUSS IN A MINUTE BUT- AT THE OUTSET WE'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM A DIRECTOR CHUCK BONHAM WHOSE- HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AS WELL AS TOM CULLEN WHO'S THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE HOSPITAL FOR. THE OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE MR COHEN IS THE STATE ON SCENE COORDINATOR AND REPRESENTS THE STATE WITHIN THE UNIFIED COMMAND STRUCTURE- SO WELCOME TODAY DIRECTOR BONHAM AND ADMINISTRATOR COLIN. THANK YOU CHAIR I'LL GO FIRST AND THEN TURNED OVER TO THE ADMINISTRATOR AND ALSO THANK YOU TO EACH OF THE- COMMITTEE MEMBERS LET ME JUST CONFIRM YOU CAN HEAR AND SEE ME OKAY. HE ATE YOU'RE COMING THROUGH WELL DIRECTOR. I THANK YOU. SO IT'S TRUE MY NAME IS CHUCK BONHAM AND I'M STILL THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WHICH I THINK IS THE GREATEST JOB IN THE WORLD. LET ME START BY JUST THANKING THE COMMITTEE FOR GIVING THE RESPONSE THE SPACE TO FOCUS ON A MONTH AGO. AND WORK WITH US TO SCHEDULE AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO MEET YOUR NEEDS FOR HEARING. WHILE NOT MATERIALLY INTERFERING WITH THE RESPONSE THAT WAS UNDERWAY AT THE HEIGHT OF. THE BEGINNING OF THIS EVENT. AND THE NEXT THING I REALLY WANT SAYS LOOK. MAKE NO MISTAKE. SUPER DIRECT BOTTOM LINE THERE IS NO GOOD WILL STILL. THE BEST SPILL IS ZERO NO STILL I HEARD THEY CAUSE DAMAGE. THEY AFFECT NATURE. AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES THEY HURT US INDIVIDUALLY YOU HEARD THE CHAIR MENTIONED HIS EXPERIENCE YOU HEARD SENATO MEN AND NUMBER MENTIONED THERE SENATOR LAYERED THEY HEARD ME INDIVIDUALLY THEY HURT EACH CALIFORNIAN. IF THERE'S ONE THING CLEAR BECAUSE OF THIS BILL. WE LOVE OUR BEACHES WE LOVE OUR OCEANS NO MATTER OUR BACKGROUND. ARTISANSHIP OUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. BUT IN THESE. SAD UNFORTUNATE MOMENTS THE TASK FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR OFFICE IS STILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE IS TO DEAL WITH IT DEAL WITH IT IN THE MOMENT. SO I'D LIKE MR KHANNA MEANT TO GIVE YOU A BETTER GRANULAR DESCRIPTION OF THE DETAILS WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS PULL BACK TO A HIGHER LEVEL AND SET THE FRAME. BUT I CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT IT KNOWLEDGE SHARING THE MARE. UP FROM HUNTINGTON BEACH SHOW YOU'LL HEAR FROM IN A MINUTE. THE CHAIR SUPERVISOR FLETCHER. EVERY SINGLE ELECTED OFFICIALS SENATOR MAN CENTER- BERG. THIS WAS AN ALL HANDS ON DECK ALL OF GOVERNMENT ALL COMMUNITY EFFORT. EACH OF US I THINK WORKED HARD TO FIND ROLES AND LEVERAGE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TOGETHER. THE SAME RUNS TRUE FOR OUR CITIZENS WE HAD TEN THOUSAND CITIZENS IN CALIFORNIA. SIGN UP TO VOLUNTEER. THE FOLKS IN MODOC THAT SIGNED UP THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WOULD BE A CHANCE FOR YOU TO HELP OUT ON THE GROUND. I THINK OUR CONSERVATION GROUPS YOU HEAR FROM SURFRIDER IN A MOMENT. BUT LET'S GO BACK ABOUT A MONTH. AND WHETHER IT'S LATE FRIDAY OCTOBER FIRST TOWARDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SATURDAY OCTOBER SECOND. IN THIS SUNDAY ON OCTOBER THIRD. WE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EVENT. A VERY SERIOUS RISKS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ECONOMY. WHAT WE NOW KNOW IS ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MILES OFF SHORE SO IN FEDERAL WATERS. THERE IS A PIPELINE THAT RUNS FROM ONE PLATFORM WHICH IS A COLLECTION OF THREE PLATFORMS OPERATED BY A COMPANY CALLED BETA OFFSHORE OWNED BY A COMPANY CALLED AMPLIFY ENERGY. THAT LAST PLATFORM ELLIE. AS A PIPELINE WHICH DELIVERS THE PRODUCT. SEVENTEEN POINT SEVEN MILES INLAND.WHERE THE PIPE COMES ON SHORE JUST BELOW THE QUEEN MARY MORE LESS. TO LAND BASED INFRASTRUCTURE. I HAD A RUPTURE IN IT AND WE NOW KNOW. BASED ON VISUAL AND DIVER AND OTHER EVIDENTIARY EFFORTS BUT ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND FEET OF THAT PIPELINE WAS MOVED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE FEET ALSO CENTER. AND IN THAT STRETCH IS ABOUT A THIRTEEN INCH HORIZONTAL ALMOST LIKE A HAIRLINE FRACTURE IF YOU COULD IMAGINE A BROWN BREAK. IN A PIPE WHICH IS I THINK ABOUT THIRTEEN INCHES IN DIAMETER CONCRETE ON THE OUTSIDE METAL ON THE INSIDE. THAT'S THE LIKELY SOURCE OF THE LEAK. FROM THE VERY BEGINNING MOMENTS ALL OF US INVOLVED ASSUMED A WORST CASE. AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME WE HAD A PLANNING NUMBER OF A SPILL OF ABOUT. THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR BARRELS WHICH IS ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND GALLONS ROUNDING AS THE MAXIMUM WORST CASE. WE SEARCHED TO BE PREPARED FOR BEYOND THAT MAXIMUM WORST CASE. AT DAWN SUNDAY MORNING OCTOBER THIRD ALL SENIOR DIRECTORS OF THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION WERE ON ONE PLANE TOGETHER. MY SELF THE DIRECTOR OF- YES MR DEALER DO CHEAT THE DIRECTOR OF STATE PARKS DIRECTOR CAN TERO ID SECULAR DIRECTOR STATE PLANS MISTER CASEY WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM LATER AND ADMINISTRATOR CALLING ALONG WITH. THE UNITED STATES COAST GUARD ADMIRAL IN CHARGE OF THIS THEATER OF OPERATIONS. WHAT I DO FROM THERE THAT MORNING TERRIFIED. IT CONFIRMED WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SIGNIFICANT EVENT. WE SHOULD ASSUME WORST CASE. AND WE SHOULD DEAL WITH IT APPROPRIATELY BASED ON THAT. LEVEL OF EFFORT OVER THE COURSE OF THIS FIRST WEEK. WE SEARCHED AN INCREDIBLE FORCE WE REACHED ACROSS THE NATION. AND BY THE END OF THAT FIRST WEEK OF OCTOBER NIGHT WE HAD WELL OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE DEPLOYED. BY WAY OF REFERENCE SENATOR LAYERED MENTIONED THE REFUGIO SPILL IN SANTA BARBARA. EVERY WILL STILL IS DIFFERENT THE FACTS REALLY DO MATTER. REFUGIO IS. CLOSE IN TIME BUT A DECADE AGO. HAPPEN WITH THE PIPELINE HAPPENED IN THE COUNTY HAPPENED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S STILL WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GALLONS WHEN ALL WAS SAID AND DONE AT THE PEAK OF OUR RESPONSE IN THE FUTURE WE HAD ABOUT A THOUSAND. PEOPLE DEPLOYED IN OUR FOR WORSE. PEAK SO FAR FOR THIS RESPONSE IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DEPLOYED WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK WE GOT CLOSE TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED AS A FORCE SEARCH. THE MIDDLE OF THAT FIRST WEEK GOVERNOR NEWSOM CAME AND SAT WITH MANY OF YOU. INCLUDING SENATOR MAN AND- BURKE. RELATED THE MAYOR ARE MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION IN CONGRESS. ON THE HOUSE SIDE WE'VE SINCE SEEN SENATOR P- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S VISIT. WE FILLED THE VOID PRETTY QUICKLY. AND I'M SO THANKFUL FOR THE MAYOR AND OTHERS WHO WERE ABLE TO DEPLOY THEIR OWN ASSETS IN THOSE FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS. OVER THE FIRST WEEK WE PUT PEOPLE ON THE BEACH WHAT'S ON THE GROUND DEALING WITH THIS WE HAD A VAST ARRAY OF VESSELS ON THE WATER. WE PRETTY IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT THE COUNTIES OF ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO INTO THE UNIFIED COMMAND. TO HELP MAKE DECISIONS INCLUDING. KNOWING WE NEEDED THEIR EXPERTISE ON PUBLIC HEALTH. BOTH AIR QUALITY AND WATER QUALITY. WITHIN THAT FIRST WEEK I CALLED THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SURFRIDER AND WE EVENTUALLY CREATED. I THINK THE FIRST TIME WE'VE EVER DONE IT. UNOFFICIAL LIAISON WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COMMUNITY TO INCREASE OUR COMMUNICATIONS IN THAT SPACE. WE IMPLEMENTED A FISHERIES CLOSURE. THOSE THAT ARE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REALIZE THE VALUE OF DUNGENESS CRAB ON THE DINNER PLATE OVER THE HOLIDAYS. THE CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC ANALOG IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THIS TIME OF YEAR IS ACTUALLY LOBSTERS ON THE PLATE. PEOPLE LOVE THE FISH FORM TO CLOSE THAT DOWN BECAUSE THE FISHERS CLOSURE. AS TIME PASSED. AND WE GOT INTO THE SECOND WEEK OF THE EVENT. WE ALL COLLECTIVELY TOOK FURTHER STEPS WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ADAPTING AND ITERATING ON A TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOUR CYCLE. STILL BEGAN TO SHIFT IN NATURE FROM A LESS OF A PRODUCT ASPECT WE COULD PICK UP ON THE WATER TO DEALING WITH TAR BALLS ON OUR BEACHES. WE HAD AN INCREDIBLY INTENSE OUTRAGE CYCLE FOR A WHILE IT WAS DAILY THEN EVERY OTHER DAY WORK EACH MORNING. WE WOULD GO THROUGH A CALL BETWEEN THOSE AGENCIES IN THE COMMAND. AND LITERALLY EVERY CITY. FROM LONG BEACH TO IMPERIAL BEACH REPORTING TO THE COMMANDWHERE TAR BALLS WERE SHOWING UP SO THAT WE CAN ITERATE AND DEPLOY FORCES TO DEAL WITH IT. WE CREATED A SEPARATE INVESTIGATORY EFFORT TO FREE THE RESPONSE FROM GRAPPLING WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT PROSECUTORIAL ISSUES. SO NOW WE HAVE A SUITE OF FEDERAL AGENCIES MY DEPARTMENT AND ALSO- AND OTHERS INVOLVED IN THE KEY EVIDENCE COLLECTION AND RECORD BUILDING FOR POTENTIAL PROSECUTION AND DAMAGES EFFORTS. WE HAD A PRETTY ITERATIVE DYNAMIC UP OVER FLIGHTS WITH THE COAST GUARD WHERE I KNOW MANY OF YOU WERE ABLE TO PUT YOUR EYES ON THE RESPONSE AND FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS. WE ARE FACED WITH THOSE TEN THOUSAND VOLUNTEERS AND PUT A LOT MORE VOLUNTEERS ON THE BEACH PICKING UP TAR BALLS THAN WE EVER HAVE BEFORE. BECAUSE OF THE FISHERIES CLOSURE WE ACTUALLY ALSO DID SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T DONE RECENTLY. WE HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING MEMBERS OF OUR COMMERCIAL FISHING FLEET TO HELP US PICK UP SAMPLES. TO DETERMINE WHEN THE FISHERIES WILL BE REOPENED. USING HEALTH INDICATORS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OPEN ALL THE BEACHES AND HARBORS. LOOK THERE ARE MANY OTHER THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING ON HERE FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THANK YOU I'M EXTREMELY INTERESTED IN THE INVESTIGATION. I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE PROSECUTION'S AROUND REFUGIO. I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO COLLECT THE EVIDENCE AND WORK WITH MULTIPLE PARTIES IN THAT SPACE. WE KNOW OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL IS DOING HIS DUE DILIGENCE AS WELL. WE KNOW WE HAVE ACHILLES ONE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SEVERAL CITIES ARE LOOKING INTO THEIR OWN LITIGATION- DYNAMICS. I KNOW THAT WE WILL SPEND TIME AND I WELCOME THAT TIME ON. THE VERY UNDERSTANDABLE WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN RELATIVE TO STARTING THISRESPONSE WHICH DOES HAVE A RELATIONSHIP TO A POTENTIAL CIVIL OR CRIMINAL DYNAMICS IN THIS CASE. AND THERE ARE MUCH BIGGER POLICY ISSUES IT FOR AS WELL. I THINK IT'S CLEAR WE ALL VALUE OUR OCEAN AND COASTLINES ALL SHORTFALL PRODUCTION IS. A COMPLICATED ISSUE IN MANY WAYS- SO CLEAR AND ANOTHER. EACH SPELL CAUSES HARM TO OUR PEOPLE OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR NATURE. GOVERNOR NEWSOM HASN'T BEEN A LEADER ON EFFORTS TO PHASE OUT THE USE OF FOSSIL FUELS JUST LAST WEEK MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM RELATIVE TO THE DYNAMIC AROUND FRACKING PERMITS IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE TAKING OFFICE THE GOVERNORS URGED THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR TO WITHDRAW CALIFORNIA FROM FURTHER CONSIDERATION FOR RENEWED OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT. AND WHILE MR CASEY WOULD KNOW BETTER I DON'T THINK IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE GRANTED NEW OFFSHORE LEASES FOR ALL PRODUCTION AND ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. BUT SETTING ALL THOSE DYNAMICS ASIDE WHICH I THINK ARE VERY UNDERSTANDABLE AREAS OF INQUIRY. I'M JUST SUPER THANKFUL HERE ONE MONTH LATER EVERYBODY I MEAN LITERALLY EVERYONE. THE CITIZENS THEY CALLED THE PEOPLE THAT WERE SENDING ME PHOTOS OF TAR BALLS AT SUCH AND SUCH LIFE STATION IN CARLSBAD MY FRIENDS WHO CALLED ME FROM SWAMI'S SAYING I'M WORRIED ABOUT MY SURF BREAK. TO EVERY ELECTED OFFICIAL. A MONTH LATER WE NOW THINK THE LIKELY STILL NUMBER IS IMPACT TO WILDLIFE WHILE VERY SERIOUS COULD HAVE BEEN FAR WORSE. I'M SUPER APPRECIATIVE LAST NIGHT THE GOVERNOR WAS ABLE TO ANNOUNCE WE SECURED A SUSPENSE IS FOR BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY THE SPILL AND THAT THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION LOANS TO BRIDGE THIS. GOT A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US. I NEED TO LEARN WHAT WE CAN DO BETTER BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE STILL. I KNOW WE CAN ITERATE AND BE BETTER BECAUSE THE THINGS WE DID IN THIS BILL. WE LEARNED IN REFUGIO HOW TO BE BETTER. THE DEPLOYMENT OF VOLUNTEERS THE ENGAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS A MEDIA OUT REACH TO YOU AT THE ELECTED OFFICIAL LEVEL BRINGING COUNTIES INTO OUR UNIFIED COMMAND ALL WAR ALL HARD LESSONS WE LEARNED IN REFUGIO. WHICH WE ADOPTED FROM THE GET GO IN THIS STILL. NO STILL IS A GOOD STILL THE BEST SPELLERS ZERO. BUT I'M THANKFUL WE COULD ALL APPROACH THIS WITH AN ALL HANDS ON DECK ALL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE WE TURNED IT MR CULLEN FOR THE DETAILS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WELCOME ADMINISTRATOR. THANK YOU KRISTIN MY PRESENTATION UP. THANK YOU OUR TRUCK FOR THOSE ARE. REMARKS ALTHOUGH UPON MANY OF THE ON THE ASPECTS YOU TOUCHED UPON AND GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR STERN STUDENTS THREE MEMBER SINCE AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU ON THIS AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS OUR RESPONSE TO THE PIPELINE. FIVE THIRTY SEVEN SPELLING AND I'D LIKE TO START UP BY GIVING A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF OUR OFFICES SPOKE PREVENTION RESPONSE AND THEN GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON THE CURRENT SITUATION DOWN IN ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTIES- LET ME SEE IF I CAN DANCE. SLIDE HERE. THE OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION RESPONSE MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS OSCAR WAS CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE BY THE LIBERTINES SEASTRAND OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ACT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PASSED THE OIL POLLUTION ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY COMMONLY REFERRED IS OPEN NINETY. THESE LAWS WERE ENACTED FOLLOWING THE EXXON VALDEZ AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE AMERICAN TRAITOR STOLE CELEB WHICH COINCIDENTLY SPILLED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND GALLONS OF CRUDE OIL OFF OF. HUNTINGTON BEACH IN FEBRUARY OF NINETEEN NINETY. OSCAR IS A TRUSTEE OF THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES ON SPECIFICALLY TASKED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S SURFACE WATERS. AND ASSOCIATE WILDLIFE AND HABITATS FROM THE EFFECTS OF TROLLING. OIL SPILLS. THIS IS A QUICK VISUAL THAT SHOWS OUR CURRENT COMPLEMENTS WHAT TWO OR THIRTY OSCAR MEMBERS ARE STATIONED THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN OUR OIL SPILL PROTECTION PROGRAM TO. OUR HEADQUARTERS IN WEST SACRAMENTO WE HAVE THREE MAJOR FIELD OFFICES OF FIRST RESPONDERS CENTER FIELD WHAT SOUND YOU KNOW SEND BAKERSFIELD ALONG WITH ANOTHER. TEN SATELLITE FIELD LOCATIONS. IN OUR OSCAR FIRST RESPONDERS ARE PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF FISH AND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION OFFICERS THAT ARE OFTEN. THE FIRST ON SCENE- FOLKS ARRIVING THEY ASSUME THE STATE ON SCENE COORDINATOR DUTIES ON MY- STORY ALONG WITH ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS AND- OIL. SPILL PREVENTION SPECIALISTS. THERE'S A BIT OF BREAD FIBER IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT YOU THE VERY ELEMENTS OF A PREVENTION. RESPONSE PROGRAM AND I WOULD ADD TO RESPOND THAT THERE'S ALSO A VERY CRITICAL RESTORATION ASPECT. SORT OF FOR THE FIRST FORTY YEARS OF OSCARS COASTAL AUTHORITY SETS WERE THE LARGEST OIL POLLUTION WAS PERCEIVED GIVEN THOSE TWO TANKER DISASTERS IN NINETEEN NINETY THAT I MENTIONED. HOWEVER WITH SEVERAL CRUDE OIL BY RAIL TRAIN ACCIDENTS IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE RAISED THE AWARENESS OF THE IMMINENT THREAT OF OIL POLLUTION TO OUR STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCES NOT TRUST. BY RAIL OR BY PIPELINE STANLEY BOIL PRODUCTION OR TRUCKS INTO ABANDONED DERELICT VESSELS PARTICULARLY WATERWAYS LIKE THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER DELTA IS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SENATE BILL EIGHT SIXTY ONE THE EXPANDED OSCARS JURISDICTION TO COVER ALL SURFACE WATERS OF THE STATE BOTH COASTAL AND INLAND. AND THIS PAST JULY AUTHORITIES TO FURTHER EXTEND TO APPLY TO NOT JUST A DRAWING BUT ALSO. THOSE RENEWABLE FUELS ARE DERIVED FROM FEEDSTOCKS LIKE YEAH HELLO. AND WHILE THESE RENEWABLES PRODUCE MUCH LESS CARBON TO THE ATMOSPHERE DURING COMBUSTION CENTER PATROLLING CAR PARKS 8% EVERY BIT THE THREAT TO WATER AND. HABITAT THE PETROLEUM DOES. ONE OF THE KEY S. OF PREPARED ESPECIALLY ARE AREA CONTINGENCY OF THE KNOWN AS B. C. THAT PROTECT COASTLINE. IF A COMPANY TRANSPORTS REFINED STORES OR PRODUCES OILS ABOVE A PRESCRIBED AMOUNT PROXIMATE TO STATE WATERS. THEY'RE REQUIRED TO FILE AN OIL SPILL CONTINGENCY ACCOUNT PLAN OR C. PLAN WITH OUR OFFICE AND UPDATE IT REGULARLY. SHE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO SPECIFY CRITICAL INFORMATION TO DESCRIBE THE PLAN HOLDERS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO SPILLED OIL INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS ARE NOTIFICATION CONTACT LIST THEY'RE CONTRACTED OIL SPILL RESPONSE ORGANIZATION OTHERWISE KNOWN AS AN SRO- THEIR INTERNAL. CONTRACTED STORE MANAGEMENT TEAM THERE PER FRAME I'M SO SORRY TRAINED AND PROFICIENT IN ALL ASPECTS OF RESPONSE. A TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THEIR OIL HANDLING INFRASTRUCTURE. THERE SHORELINE PROTECTION EQUIPMENT AS REQUIRED BY THE RELEVANT ACP. LANCE FOR AFFECTED WILDLIFE CARE AND THERE'S ALSO MANY OTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENTS. SO WHEN AN OIL SPILL OCCURS THERE'S AN ALPHABET SOUP OF STATE FEDERAL AND LOCAL AGENCIES THAT TYPICALLY RESPONDS. TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE PLAN OTHERWISE KNOWN AS ICS CERT INCIDENT COMMAND SYSTEM AND THE UNIFIED COMMAND AT THE TOP IS A COMBINATION OF A FEDERAL ON SCENE COORDINATOR AND SEE THE COAST GUARD OR PPA BY OPEN NINETY- THE US. ON C. COORDINATOR FROM OSCAR. A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SPELLING COMPANY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AND AN INNOVATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT IN THE NATIONAL PLAN BUT WE DON'T EXPLOIT. IN REFUGIO IN THE COSCO BUSAN STILL IN SAN FRANCISCO I AM VERY EFFECTIVELY HERE. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON SCENE COORDINATOR. SO THE ORGANIZATION CHART THAT I HAVE HERE WHILE IT'S NOT MUCH MUCH BIGGER IN REALITY THIS SHOW SOME OF THE KEY FUNCTIONS THAT ASPARTIC TYPICALLY LEADS. OR PARTICIPATES AND- CONCURRENT WITH THE RESPONSE OPERATION WITH TWO BOXES YOU SEE UP TOP. ON THE- SEVERAL CRITICS I'M SORRY YOUR TIME CRITICAL CIVIL AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION WHICH BROKEN BOTTOM MENTIONED AS I'M GOING. AND ALSO A NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT IT'S A PROCESS BY WHICH THE STATE AND FEDERAL TRUSTEE AGENCIES WORK PROPERLY WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND RESPONSIBLE PARTY. TO ASSESS ECOLOGICAL DAMAGES AND LOSS OF HUMAN USE CAUSED BY SPILLS SO FOR EXAMPLE AFTER THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN REFUGIO OIL SPILL ON THAT WAS SETTLED. IN AND THEN R. D. EIGHT PROCESS IN OCTOBER OF- AUGUST TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THERE'S TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS. AGREED UPON TO RESPOND SERIOUS. REST PROJECTS ABOUT TWELVE ON MILLION SEVEN AND ENSURE COUNTIES. MOST WILL STILL CONTINUES TO CLAIM HOLDERS WILL NAME THE OIL LIGHT WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK OR O. W. C. M. AS THEIR WILDLIFE CARE SOLUTION THE- WCMH BY THE ONE HEALTH INSTITUTE AT UC DAVIS IS A NETWORK OF MORE THAN FORTY SPECIALIZED. WILDLIFE CARE CENTERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA IT'S REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD OF OILED WILDLIFE CARE IN THE WORLD SO IN THE CASE OF THE PIPELINE FIVE THIRTY SEVEN SO WE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ALREADY SAID THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING HAPPENING OFFSHORE OUTSIDE STATE WATERS BUT THEY IMMEDIATELY- ENGAGED RESPONDED AND THEY STILL REMAIN. DEPLOYED FOR THE RESPONSE. SO NOW NO WONDER THE ACTUAL SPELLING SO DIRECT ABOUT MENTION. THAT POINT LIKE THAT WE HAD ON THE MORE BACK TO THIRD WINTER YOUR- WHY EXACTLY DRACULA- AND MANY OTHERS AND THIS IS A CONTRACTED OUT OF THE WINDOW THAT SHOWED WHAT WE SAW AND THE HORROR THAT WE FELT. I BELIEVE YOU'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE PARTICULARS OF SMILE RED DOT WAS DISPLACED HERE BUT IT'S ACTUALLY JUST BEFORE THE BAND RIGHT HERE THIS IS WHERE THE- FOUR THOUSAND FOUR SECTION DISPLACED A HUNDRED FIVE FEET. ARE THE DIRECTOR OF BOTTOM MENTIONED. ON. SO HERE WE HAVE PLATFORM BELLY AND- AND THE OTHER TWO PLATFORMS THAT ARE SERVED AT PIPELINE AND THEN COMES ASHORE IS STRUCK BY MENTIONED UP BY THE QUEEN MARY. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS OF THE OIL SPILL IS THE SHORELINE CLEANUP ASSESSMENT TECHNIQUE TEAMS TO ASSESSING CLEAN. MANY MILES OF AFFECTED BE TRYING. TO SCHEDULE TEAM DEPLOYMENT CCAP HOTSHOT TEAMS ARE ON STANDBY TO RESPOND REPORTS. OILS ALONG THE COAST. CRICKET TEAM SERVING SCHEDULED AND DEPLOYED TO THE SPEECHES TO DO A MORE THOROUGH CLEAN UP AT THE HEIGHT OF THE RESPONSE AS DIRECTED BY THE MENTION THERE WERE MORE THAN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED TRAINED RESPONDERS BOTH IN THE COMMAND POST. AND IN THE FIELD. UNFORTUNATELY THE RESPONSE. WE ARE REQUIRED TO CLOSE ALL FISHING A LARGER IN THE OCEAN IN THE VICINITYOF THE SPELLS WE RECOGNIZE THAT WAS THIS WAS PARTICULARLY HARD. ON THE LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITY HAS A LOBSTER SEASON HAD TRUST. OPENED WHEN THE SPILL OCCURRED. AND WE'RE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT OR OTHERWISE KNOWN AS WE HA. I WILL TELL YOU A- CHEMICAL DATA AND ADVICE THE DEPARTMENT. OUR DEPARTMENT. ON WHETHER CLOSER TO BE LISTED. NOT. TO REOPEN THIS IS FREE SO IT'S POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SPILL THEY WERE NOT AS MANY I'M SORRY. FORTUNATELY GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE SPELLED OR NOT AS MANY WYLIE'S CASTLE HE SAYS COULD HAVE OCCURRED. NOW DURING pW. SEVEN CAPTURED AND REHABILITATE MANY BIRDS INCLUDING IN DANGER SO IT WORKS. THIS IS A SCREENSHOT OF ONE OF THEIR MANY FACEBOOK POSTINGS. SHOWING A CAREFUL CARE THAT THESE SMALL BIRDS AN ANSWER THE STAFF AND TO HABITAT. AND THIS IS A BEFORE AND AFTER PICTURE OF OIL DOCTOR BROUGHT IT BROUGHT A SMILE TO ALL OF OUR FACES FOR HORSES DURING THIS DIFFICULT RESPONSE. INSTRUCTED BY AN IMMENSELY WITH THE VOLUNTEER EFFORT WE ALSO RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS OUTPOURING OF INTEREST FROM CONSERVATIVE CITIZENS. INTEREST IN HELPING THE RESPONSE. WORKING WITH CAL VOLUNTEERS THE WEBSITE WAS ESTABLISHED THAT REGISTERED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS FROM MANY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE OF THE CITIZENS WERE OFFERED AN ABBREVIATED ONE TIME TRAINING CALLS HAS WATER WHICH STANDS FOR HAZARDOUS WASTE OPERATIONS. EMERGENCY RESPONSE IT'S CRITICAL TRAINING THAT TEACHES ALL HAZARDOUS WASTE RESPONDENTS ABOUT THE THREATS OF EXPOSURE AND HOW TO BEST PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR COLLEAGUES. THERE WERE FOUR WELL ORGANIZED SPONSORED DEPLOYMENTS DURING THE RESPONSE AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY FIVE PARTICIPANTS. FROM THE COMMUNITY DURING EACH ONE OF THESE. APPOINTMENTS SO I'M OFFERED SOME FIGHTS WITH UPDATED NUMBERS FROM THIS MORNING'S DAILY UNIFIED COMMAND SITUATION BREAKING SO CURRENTLY THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY SIX RESPOND WRISTS ON THE FIELD ASSESSMENT CLEANING BEACHES PRIMARILY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY WHAT CAR BILLS TAR BALLS CONTINUE TO WASH SHORT. TWENTY SIX OTHER PERSONNEL AND FOR OPERATING BASIS AND AN% ADDITIONAL THIRTY FIVE WORKING VIRTUALLY IN THE COMMAND FUNCTION. THE PHYSICAL UNIFIED COMMAND AT OCEAN COAST COLLEGE IN COSTA MESA DEMOBILIZED THIS PAST SUNDAY. TO DATE MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF OIL AND OIL DEBRIS PRIMARILY STAND HAS BEEN COLLECTED. NEARLY A THOUSAND POUNDS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY JUST IN THE PAST TWO DAYS. IF I CHOSE THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE UNIFIED. COMMAND USES TO EVALUATE THE THIRTY SEVEN ORANGE COUNTY IN SEVENTY SAN DIEGO COUNTY COASTLINE SEGMENTS. OPERATIONS CONTINUOUS CACTI THE STAFF TEAMS LOCATE. AND ARM AND DEPLOYED TO IRAQ TO THE SITE TO DATE SCOTT TEAM SERVICE DESK THREE HUNDRED FORTY THREE MILES OF COASTLINE AND CLEAN UP CREWS HAVE CLEANED. FOUR HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILES ON THESE NUMBERS OBVIOUSLY REFLECT REPEAT VISITS TO SEVERAL SEGMENTS OF THE BEACH. DURING THE RESPONSE MORE THAN TWENTY THREE THOUSAND FEET OF PROTECTIVE CONTAINMENT AND SORTED BOOM WAS DEPLOYED WE PROTECTED THIRTEEN CENTS OF SENSITIVE SITES. INTENDS TO CLAMP. RESPONSE ASSETS INCLUDED THIRTEEN RESPONSE VESSELS MULTIPLE FIXED WING HELICOPTER AND UNMANNED AIRCRAFT IN. OUR PEAK ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED THIRTY SIX PERSONNEL. DECONTAMINATION OF RECREATIONAL VESSELS CONTINUES AT THREE LOCATIONS TO DATE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FIFTY NINE VESSELS HAVE BEEN CLEANED AND SEVENTY FIVE MORE OR TO BE SCHEDULED WITH ANOTHER HUNDRED TEND. TO BE ASSESSED. NO ADDITIONAL OIL WHY LECTURE CONCERT IN THE PAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND ONE REHABILITATED BIRD WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY. THE WCM STRESSES THAT OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND TEN ANIMALS REPORTED DEAD ON ARRIVAL AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT COLUMN. SHE WAS THEM SORTED STERILE OILING AND NEED TO BE FURTHER EXAMINED. ANY DEAD WILDLIFE COLLECTED ON THE SHORELINE ARE AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED INTO THIS TABLE. AND AS THE RESPONSE CONCLUDE. OUR WORK STILL NOT DONE THE INVESTIGATION AND RDA THE RECOVERY OF OUR COSTS AND VERY IMPORTANT YES THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED. AN ASSESSMENT OF OUR RESPONSE ACTIONS WITH A LOOK AT FAMILY BEST PRACTICES BUT WHERE THOSE AREAS THAT WE CAN IMPROVE RESPONSES IN THE FUTURE. AND WITH THAT AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ATTENTION AND OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING. AT THANK YOU FOR THAT THOROUGH OVERVIEW ADMINISTRATOR COLIN- I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT AS SOON- SOME OF THE MEMBERS ALSO DO AS WELL- I'LL I'LL JUST START OUT AT THE OUTSET- BY ENQUIRING- THE TIMELINE FOR THAT AFTER ACTION REPORT DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT OF WHEN. YOU ALL ANTICIPATE COMPLETING THAT THANK YOU SENATOR- WE'VE ALREADY STARTED THE UNIFIED COMMAND MATT AND WHILE THEY WERE STILL MOBILIZED% OCEAN COAST COLLEGE TO START GATHERING YOU KNOW SOME OF THOSE ITEMS I MENTIONED. FOR THE REFUGIO SPILL IT TOOK US ABOUT TWELVE MONTHS YEAH WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS TASK. AND- WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY. IF I COULD I'D ALSO JUST SAY. PART OF WHAT WE EXPERIENCE AND LEARN FROM IN REFUGIO IS. AS WE THINK THROUGH OUR ASSESSMENTS SICK THE FEEDBACK OF OTHERS INVOLVED SO I DO THINK PART OF THIS DYNAMIC WOULD BE. HOW DO WE GET FEEDBACK FROM OUR CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE KIND OF BROADLY INVOLVED WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE TO GET FEEDBACK YOU KNOW FROM OUR LOCAL CITIES. MAKING SURE WE HAVE THOSE AND PUT BLINDS FOR THE FEEDBACK AND ASSESSMENT I THINK WILL BE REALLY VALUABLE. EXCELL AWFULLY TODAY STARTS THAT PROCESS IN A MORE FORMAL CONTEXT BUT- AND THAT'LL CONTINUE- MY OTHER QUESTIONS- THE- TO DO WITH THE ISSUES THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE FULLY EVALUATED YET BUT IN TERMS OF- WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER- I WANTED TO JUST GET YOUR INITIAL TAKE ON- THE ACTUAL- THE ACTUAL DETECTION TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING OUT THERE- WHEN I WENT OUT WE WERE- LOSING SOME CAMERAS AND THE C. THIRTY SEVENS THAT WERE MOVING AROUND WITH COAST GUARD. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS NO SURFACE SEARCH RADAR- CURRENTLY BEING DEPLOYED- THAT WE'RE NOT UTILIZING ANY AUTOMATED WATER QUALITY SENSING LOUISE OR OTHER TECHNIQUES IN OUR DETECTION PROCESS- HAVE YOU. HAVE YOU- AND ANY COMMENTS ON ON THOSE ISSUES WHETHER- BUT COULD HAVE BEEN- EITHER MORE MORE TIMELY IN OUR RESPONSE OR OR IF THOSE ARE SORT OF OUTSTANDING ITEMS THE DEPARTMENT STILL LOOKING TO OBTAIN OR OR NOT NECESSARY FOR SOME REASON. A COMBINATION AND THEN ALAS MR CALLING TO FILL IN ANY BLANKS FIRST. IT'S TOTALLY UNDERSTANDABLE AND WE CAN ALWAYS TIGHTEN UP THOSE FIRST TWENTY FOUR TO SEVENTY TWO HOURS AND THESE DYNAMICS. SADLY I'VE LIVED THROUGH TWO AT A PRETTY. IMPACTFUL SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING FOR US IN THE OPENING MOMENTS IS. TRYING TO CONFIRM WHAT'S GOING ON DEALING WITH MANY MANY AND THAT INFORMATION AND PUTS. AND THEN BEING STABLE ENOUGH ON INFORMATION TO KNOW WHERE TO DEPLOY. OF COURSE YOU DON'T WANT TO SEARCH A THOUSAND PEOPLE TO THE WRONG PLACE. SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT WHAT WILL EVENTUALLY DISCOVER WAS PLAYING OUT THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING OF SATURDAY OCTOBER SECOND. OUR WARDENS ACTUALLY WORK OUT THERE ALL FORWARD ON THAT SATURDAY WE HAD FOLKS ON THE WATER ANYWAY RELATIVE TO THE LOBSTER OPENER. AND IN THE DARK WERE YOU KNOW WORKING AS ONE OF THOSE INFORMATION CHANNELS. SECOND COMMENT SENATOR. I AM NOT QUALIFIED TO COMMENT ABOUT WHAT KIND OF DETECTION TECHNOLOGY I DO THINK WE SHOULD KEEP OUR MIND OPEN AND PUSH OURSELVES TO IMPROVE IN THAT AREA REMINDER THE FEDERAL WATERS PRETTY FAR OUT AS TO THE PLATFORM ITSELF. AND I AM NOT AWARE OF EXISTING WATER BILL YOU DYNAMIC OUT THERE THAT MAY BE COLLECTING WATER QUALITY FIRST FOR EXAMPLE PERHAPS OVER TIME THAT NETWORK COULD BECOME THAT AUTOMATED AND THAT FINE TUNED. AND THIS IS WHERE MR CULLEN MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER EACH YEAR PART OF US FIRST CHARGE IS TO BE CONVENING INDUSTRY AND THE EXPERTS IN THE SCIENTISTS TO PURPOSEFULLY ASK WHAT IS THE NEXT VERSION OF TECHNOLOGY. I DO THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING INTO WHAT CANBE HAPPENING OVERNIGHT WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING IN THE DARK THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THIS PROFESSIONAL SPACE HOW MUCH YOU CAN BE DOING IN THE DARK BUT THAT SEEMS TO ME AN OBVIOUS ARENA TO THINK ABOUT AS THE TECHNOLOGY. ADMINISTRATOR CALLING YOU WANNA. THE TECHNOLOGY. YOUR SOUL OUR OUR CUTTINGS STATUTE BE. PERKS KING STREET STAND ACT MANDATES SAY- THAT WE BEST TRIPLE TECHNOLOGIES SPILLS AND SO WITH THAT IN MIND EVERY TWO YEARS SINCE THIS PAST FEBRUARY WE CO HOST OIL SPILL TECHNOLOGY WORKSHOP THIS PAST ONE HELD VIRTUALLY OVER THE COURSE OF FOUR DAYS HAD SEVENTY ONE COUNTRIES REPRESENTED WITH MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS- EVERYTHING FROM REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES- TO- VARIOUS BOOMING INTO CONTAINMENT TECHNIQUES AND SO FORTH SO. SPECIFIC TO THIS BILL- LOOKING BACK AT MY PREVIOUS CAREER IN THE COAST GUARD- I FLEW MANY MISSIONS WITH SOMETHING CALLED A SIDE LOOKING AIRBORNE RADAR WHICH WAS A SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR WHICH WAS VERY. CAPABLE OF DETECTING VARIATIONS AND WATER DAMPENING SOMEONE OIL SLICKS ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT FLATTER AND THE RADAR CAN DETECT THAT. THAT WAS EMPLOYED EARLY ON IN THIS BILL IT WAS ABLE TO SEE- SEE SOME THE BOUNDARIES OF THE HEAVIER OIL IT'S INEFFECTIVE FORESEEN- WE'RE NOT AWARE OF AND PERHAPS THAT TECHNOLOGY WILL BE DEVELOPED AS ANY SHORE BASED RADAR THE COMPULSORY. IN DETECT OIL. ON OUR PARTNER STARTED DESCRIPTIONS TO IN A LAWYER. ON THERE IS A- ARTIFACT CALLED THE SOUTHERN- CALIFORNIA OBSERVATION- SENSING SYSTEM SCREWS. THEY HAVE SOME CALL THE HF RADAR WHICH IS VERY EFFECTIVE AND WE USED IT DURING THE SPELL AND REFUGIO. TO SEND A PULSE OUT AND HELP BETTER PROTECT TRAJECTORIES OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE OUT THERE ALSO WHAT WATER CURRENCY IN SURFACE WINDS- BUT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR US OUR CENTER TO CONTINUE TO GO AND LOOK AT TECHNOLOGIES THAT. CAN DETECT OIL ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. SIR I THINK WE HAVE A GREAT YOU KNOW- WE'RE KEEPING OUR LIST OF OTHER THINGS WHERE WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT DOING BETTER I THINK AS EXAMPLES. INSTEAD OF IT IN THE EVENT TRAINING VOLUNTEERS IS THERE A WAY TO CULTIVATE VOLUNTEERS LIKE ANNUALLY SO MORE PEOPLE ARE UP TO DATE ON TRAINING. AS AN EXAMPLE I THINK A PLACE WE CAN BE DOING BETTER IS. INSTEAD OF HAVING THE EVENTS AND THEN BEING ENGAGED WITH A LOT OF EXTERNAL SCIENTISTS. AT ALL THESE LEADING INSTITUTIONS WHAT IF WE'RE DOING THAT MORE REGULARLY. THEY WAS THE FIRST I'M A OF WHAT WE KILL ME PUBLIC HEALTH INTO THE COMMAND I THOUGHT THAT WAS OUTSTANDING. AT A STRATEGIC LEVEL BUT MY GUESS IS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO. PRACTICE THAT WAS COUNTIES ALONG THE COAST TO BE TACTICALLY. MORE ADEPT IN RAPID IN BRINGING AND THEN THAT WAY. AS OTHER EXAMPLES OF IMPROVEMENTS. I'D LIKE TO BUILD ON YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE VOLUNTEERS WE HAVE A MODEL ALREADY IN PLACE WITH THE OIL WHILE IT'S KERR NETWORK THEY HAVE THE- A QUITE A NETWORK OF AFFILIATED VOLUNTEERS THAT GOES THROUGH RECURRING TRAINING. OUGHT TO PREPARE THEM TO GO OUT AND PERFORM THEIR WILDLIFE MISSION SO WE CAN TAKE THAT. CASCADEDINTO THE VOLUNTEER EFFORT RESTAURANT THEM GIVE THEM THAT RECURRING TRAINING SO THAT THEY'RE BETTER PREPARED AND POISED TO SURGE WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS. THANKS FOR THOSE COMMENTS IN YOUR CHANGES PAID MY FINAL QUESTION BY VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IS GREAT BUT THREE THOUSAND SIGNED UP IN. ONE AT YOU KNOW FIVE FIVE EIGHT SIX OR TURNED AWAY FOR VARIOUS REASONS- YOU KNOW WE'RE DIDN'T SEEM LIKE WE'RE TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL TO HELP BUT- WE CAN DIG MORE INTO THAT LATER- MEMBERS ALL ALL. AND LAGERALD JUMP IN WITH QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IF YOU HAVE ANY AT THIS POINT- ARE YOU BUT I CAN DO FOR. OKAY CENTERMAN WHAT YOU START OFF. THANK YOU I FIRST JUST WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN ADMINISTRATOR COLIN AND DIRECTOR BONHAM- YEAH I MANY WAYS I THINK THAT THE LESSONS YOU LEARNED FROM REFUGIO JUST WITNESSING IT IN ACTION THIS WAS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW GOVERNMENT. CAN WORK EFFECTIVELY IN RESPONDING TO CRISES IN AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH YOUR OPERATION- HOW QUICKLY RAMPED UP- THAT DIDN'T THIS SIZE OF THE TEAM THAT WAS ON SITE. YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS SO THANK YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOUR YOUR EFFORTS WERE CRITICAL IN PREVENTING US FROM BECOMING A LARGER PROBLEM IN ORANGE COUNTY- I SHOULD ALSO MENTION I YOU MENTIONED TRAINING. I REMEMBER TALKING WITH THE PROPRIETOR OF THE HUNTINGTON BEACH WETLANDS WHEN WE WENT TO VISIT AND TODAY HAD SAID THAT- ABOUT NINE MONTHS EARLIER THAN ACTUALLY HAD A TRAINING EXERCISE ON THE REASONS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET BOOMS DEPLOYED SO QUICKLY IS BECAUSE THEY JUST ON THE TRAINING EXERCISES. WHEN THE BLOOMS ARRIVED THEY WERE- YOU THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO WITH THEM BECAUSE IT WAS FRESH IN THEIR MIND I THINK THAT'S A VERY- IMPORTANT ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW WE LEARN FROM THE FUTURE- I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS THOUGH ON TOP OF THAT- I GUESS FOLLOWING ON- CENTER STERN'S QUESTION EARLY DETECTION- YOU KNOW WE'VE READ AND THIS IS ALSO THE SOME OF THE BACKGROUND MATERIALS RECEIVED TODAY THAT. THERE ARE NUMBER OF FAILURES OF- REGULATION THAT THAT WE'VE TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONG TIME THAT- FEDERATIONS HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT WEIRD AT EITHER END BOTH AT THIS SORT OF- GOVERNMENTAL LEVEL BUT ALSO AT THE PROPRIETOR OF THAT IS TO SAY THAT THE OIL. DRILLING AND EXTRACTION OPERATORS THEMSELVES HAVE NOT KEPT UP WITH THE TYPES OF MONITORING THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IN DETECTING ALWAYS SPELLS EARLIER ON AND THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT THIS PARTICULAR OUR OIL SPILL COULD HAVE BEEN DETECTED MUCH EARLIER- PERHAPS NOT JUST AT THE ONSET OF THIS PRETTY. GOOD SPELL BUT THAT. THE PROBLEMS THE PIPE. MIGHT HAVE BEEN MONTH-EARLIER IF THEY HAD BETTER. MIND SO. AND I GUESS I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO. WHAT TYPES OF REGULATIONS WHETHER FEDERAL STATE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER MIGHT HAVE BEEN HELPFUL IN. PREVENTING THIS PARTICULAR SPELL FROM HAPPENING. SO SENATOR. A COUPLE THOUGHTS HERE FIRST- I'M GONNA SAY UP FRONT I THINK MY ANSWER TO YOU WILL NOT BE AS FULLY RESPONSIVE AS YOU WANT AND THERE'S A REASON. PRIMARILY THE LIKELY SOURCE FOR THE LEAK IS IN FEDERAL WATERS. FOR IF A PIPELINE WITH PRIMARILY FEDERAL JURISDICTION. AS YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT THIS IS THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY AGENCY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THAT INVESTIGATION THAT'S OCCURRING. THERE'S A FEDERAL A CORRECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE DEBATE OFF SHORE WE HAD A VERY DETAILED APPROACH OF THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE. NO RESTARTED THAT EFFECTIVE PIPELINE MATT KERR IN LAST UNTIL THE WHOLE SUITE OF CONDITIONS PRECEDING DOORMAT UNDER THAT FEDERAL WATER. SIMULTANEOUSLY WE'VE GOT THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVOLVED WE'VE GOT SOMETHING AT THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR WHICH IS THE BUREAU OF SAFETY ENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENT WHICH HAS JURISDICTION EFFECTIVELY OVER THE PLATFORMS AND THAT INFRASTRUCTURE. BY WARDENS ARE IN THAT SPACE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN INTEREST IN PROTECTING THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY AND UNDERSTANDING THE COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE FOR OUR OWN INDIVIDUAL NEEDS POTENTIALLY. I REALLY CAN'T COMMENT ON THE DYNAMICS AROUND THE PIPE ITSELF. I WILL ALSO JUST BLUNTLY SAY TO YOU I REALIZED- WHO KNEW WHAT WHEN WHO ACTIVATED WHAT REQUIRED DISCLOSURE WHEN. IS OF EXTREME IMPORTANCE AS WELL. BUT IT IS CONNECTED TO THAT. EVIDENTIARY AN INVESTIGATORY DYNAMIC AND I JUST CAN'T COMMENT I MEAN I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I KNOW IT'S NON RESPONSIVE- IN THE SENSE OF WHY YOU'RE ENQUIRING MAYBE I DIDN'T ARTICULATE THE QUESTION WELL ENOUGH I'M NOT TRYING INTERESTED AT THIS MOMENT IN IN THE WHO WHAT WHY WHEN. I'M MORE THINKING ABOUT HYPOTHETICALLY- ARE THERE REGULATORY CHANGES AND RECOGNIZING THAT A LOT OF THIS IN THIS INSTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- BUT WHAT REGULATORY CHANGES MIGHT HAVE HELPED WITH A SPELL OF THIS TYPE- GOING FORWARD IN OTHER WORDS WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO PREVENT- AND PERHAPS FIND EARLIER DETECTION OF. THESE TYPES OF SPILLS- YOU KNOW WHAT. CAN WE TRY TO SEEK TO IMPLEMENT- WHAT CHANGES CAN WE AGAIN THINKING ABOUT THIS GENETICALLY BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS- WHAT WOULD HAVE HELPED PREVENT THIS OR WHAT MIGHT HELP GOING FORWARD UNFORTUNATELY. LET ME PROJECT FORWARD AND JUST OFFER MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION I THINK AUTOMATION. IS A CORE VALUE CORE STRATEGY TO THE EXTENT WHERE NOT WE SHOULD BE. AND WHERE WE ARE BUT COULD DO IT BETTER. I THINK. I ENDED DAUGHTER. PERSISTENT INSPECTION AND AGAIN I'M NOT COMMENTING LOOKING BACKWARDS ON THIS ON WHETHER EITHER OF THOSE VARIABLES FOR A PLAY BUT GOING FORWARD I THINK AUTOMATION. AN INSPECTION. AND DISCLOSURE AROUND BOTH THOSE DYNAMICS ARE THREE KEY VARIABLES AUTOMATION INSPECTION AND DISCLOSURE. THANK YOU. FIVE ADMINISTRATOR CALLING YOUR METHODS. I'M THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO OUR CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR KIND COMMENTS BY THE WAY AND FOR YOUR VISIT TO THE COMMAND POST- WE REGULARLY HOLD A STATE OIL SPILL REGULATOR GROUP THAT IS COMPOSED OF THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT HAVE PREVENTION RESPONSIBILITY SO FOR ON DEMAND PRODUCTION THEY'LL BE KILLED CHOPS FOR- MARINE TERMINALS AND OFFSHORE PLATFORMS THAT WOULD BE STATE LANDS COMMISSION- RAIL WOULD BE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THEN OF COURSE PIPELINES. FOR THE INTER I'M SORRY INTRASTATE PIPELINE SERVICE STATE FIRE MARSHAL SO YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE'RE pOF WEEKS TO THAT GROUP WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGIES AND BETTER WAYS OF COMMUNICATING. BETWEEN OUR AGENCIES. THANK YOU. MY SECOND QUESTION REVOLVES AROUND- NOT THE TIMING OF THE SPILL BUT THE TIMING OF NOTIFICATION TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND CITIES AND COUNTIES- I WAS TALKING WITH MAYOR KIM CARR EARLIER THIS WEEK AND I DON'T WANT TO. GIVE A SPOILER ON HER TESTIMONY BUT- YOU KNOW SINCE SHE'S GONNA BE SPEAKING LATER I JUST I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS SOMETHING HE RAISED. THEY FELT LIKE THEY WERE VERY FORTUITOUS AND I CAN LET HER DESCRIBE THE EXACT CIRCUMSTANCES LATER IN FINDING ABOUT THAT OUT ABOUT THIS BILL AS EARLY AS THEY DID- EVEN THAT THAT BEINGSAID THEY THEY FELT LIKE THEY COULD HAVE ACTUALLY GOTTEN NOTICE MANY HOURS EARLIER- THAT THE U. S. COAST GUARD. HAD KNOWN ABOUT IT EARLIER THAN WAS COMMUNICATED HUNTINGTON BEACH- THEY ALSO SHE ALSO EXPRESSED TO ME THAT. THEY HAD A LOT OF EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY HAD HAD A CARGO ACCIDENT A CARGO SHIP ACCIDENT ACCIDENT OFF THE COAST OF HUNTING BEACH- LIKE MAYBE NINE MONTHS EARLIER AND SO THEY- IN RESPONSE TO THAT HAD GOTTEN A LOT OF EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THIS SO- H. B. WAS WAS PARTICULARLY WELL PREPARED WHAT WAS- I GUESS NOTICED EARLIER THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CASE OTHERWISE BUT- IT THINKING ABOUT THIS GOING FORWARD WOULD IT MAKE MORE SENSE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF A- FORMAL NOTIFICATION PROCESS. SO THAT AS SOON AS THE U. S. COAST GUARD FINDS OUT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT THEY'RE COMMUNICATING IT TO- THE AFFECTED LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND AS WELL AS A COUNTY- SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND. QUICKLY BECAUSE OURS OBVIOUSLY MATTER IN AN INSTANCE LIKE THIS AND THEN AS A SECONDARY QUESTION. ARM WOULD BE HELPFUL TO THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW HAVING REGIONAL SITES OR REGIONAL COLLECTIVE STATE TO GATHER SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT MIGHT BE. USEFUL IN RESPONSE. TO THESE TYPES OF SPILLS OR EVENTS. I ANSWERED YES AND YES. SO ON THE ROAD NO. DINA ONE OF THE THINGS I PERSONALLY WANNA. BE INVOLVED IN AND UTILIZE THE ASSESSMENT FOR. IS THAT WHICH MOMENTS WAS NOTIFICATION GOING WHERE IN WHAT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM. AND THEN BASED ON MY BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THAT ACROSS THE SUITE OF INFORMATION CHAINS ASK OURSELVES COLLECTIVELY AS SHOULD WE ALL TAKE A LOOK AT HOW NOTIFICATIONS HANDLED I MEAN WE DO HAVE A NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER. BUT YOU KNOW YOU'VE GOT COMMUNICATIONS GOING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE- ASSESS COLLECTIVELY IS THERE A SMARTER WAY TO HANDLE OR IMPROVE UPON NOTIFICATIONS EVERY HOUR DOES MATTER. MY SECOND ANSWER YES ON REGIONAL COLLECTIVES IS IN PART BECAUSE IT KIND OF HAPPENS NOW LAST FOR THE ADMINISTRATOR TO WEIGH IN. ARE THE- CONTINGENCY PLANS YOU SAW IN THE EARLIER SLIDE IS THAT IDENTIFICATION IN ADVANCE OF THE MOST SENSITIVE WETLANDS AND OTHER SITES. IN THE PLACES WHERE LOCALIZED EQUIPMENT IS ALREADY PRE COLLECTED. HOWEVER I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AGAIN AND ASK YOU FOR PUTTING ENOUGH WEAPONS IN THE RIGHT PLACES EARLY ENOUGH BEFORE EVENTS. TIME YOU WANT TO WEIGH IN ON EITHER OF THESE SHORT TRUCK AS WELL WELL GO FIGURE LAST COMING AND THEN. THE EARLIER ONE SO WITH A LOCAL EQUIPMENT WE HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM WHERE WE- AND THIS IS I THINK CENTER WHAT YOU REFER TO WIN SEATS ON EXERCISE OF ROLLING OUT EQUIPMENT. THE END AND EVALUATING IT SO WE PROVIDE TRAILERS AND BOOM TO BOMB MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND WE CAN LOOK AT ENHANCING THAT PROGRAM EVEN MORE IT'S VERY SUCCESSFUL AND THEY ARE OF COURSE REPOSITION IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE SOME SOME SITES- AND DOG THING GOING BACK TO NOTIFICATIONS- SO WHEN. I FIRST. HEARD ABOUT. OFF EVENT THAT SATURDAY MORNING DISSECT. I AM USUALLY A AT MY I PAD AT PULLS ON. WHAT'S HAPPENING ON SURFACE WATERS AS BEST SELECTIVITY AND ALSO ANOTHER APP THAT YOU'RE ACTIVELY- I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL AIRCRAFT THEY WERE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE OUTLOOK- HELICOPTERS DOING CIRCLES ALL SORTS RIGHT NOW IDEA OF WHERE. THIS WAS HAPPENING BUT I WAS ALSO TAKEN ABACK WITH HOW MANY VESSELS WERE LINED UP CLOSE TO THE SHORELINE AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE TIME THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR AIR SHOW SCHEDULED FOR THAT WEEKEND. AND MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS WERE OH MY GOSH. WHAT IF ALL THESE VESSELS START GOING IN COLLECTING OIL ON THEIR HOLES AND CARRYING IT BACK TO THEIR- HOME PORTS AND HARBORS AND MARINAS. AND ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THAT DAY I CAN'T TELL YOU EXACTLY WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT ALTHOUGH THE COAST GUARD STARTED ISSUING POSSIBLY CALLED- URGENT MARINE FOR BROADCAST NOTICE TO MARINERS. ON VHF CHANNEL SIXTEEN. AND. IN FACT- THEY CANCELED DAY OF THAT IS SO- I KNOW WAS A- IMPACT TO HELLO KIND OF BUT IT WAS THE RIGHT IN THE IMPORTANT THING TO DO TO MINIMIZE. THE- THE TRANSPORT OF SOME THAT OIL- IN FACT WE OVERHEARD SOME MOST BROADCAST BE MADE AS WE FLEW OVER SO. THESE ARE ALL GONNA BE PARTS OF NOT ONLY OUR INTERNAL ABSTRACTS RECORD BUT ALSO THE INVESTIGATION LOOKING AT. WHEN VARIOUS ENTITIES WERE MADE AWARE OF THIS AND THE SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS THAT WERE MADE. THAT IN TURN ALERTED THE PUBLIC. BUT IT. MY FINAL- AND THEN YOU GET AGAIN FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- AT THIS POINT DO WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF THE ALL IN LIKELY COSTS OF THE SPILL BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND THEN. TAKE CENTRE CERTAIN NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES WHERE I IMAGINE- HOW LONG WILL THE DAMAGE CONTINUOUS AND WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TIME LINE GOING FORWARD AND WHAT'S ALL IN COSTS GOING TO BE. I WOULD I'M NOT GONNA. PREDICT THE ALL IN COST I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE A REALLY GOOD FEEL FOR THAT AND OF COURSE YOU CAN'T. EVER PUT A VALUE ON THE- LOTS OF PART OF NATURE. AND I WILL JUST GIVE YOU A REFERENCE CENTER AND AGAIN. EVERY SPELL IS DIFFERENT BUT IT IS RELATIVELY RECENT IN TIME AND A WAS OF A VOLUME OF WHAT WE THOUGHT ORIGINALLY WAS THE WORST CASE FOR THIS PIPELINE SPILL. THE REFUGIO CASE- THE EVENT HAPPENED IN MAY OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. AND WE SAW THE CRIMINAL CONVICTION- ASPECT OF THAT RESOLVED AND THE FALL OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SO ABOUT THREE YEARS. WE SAW THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT RESOLVE ALL THE CIVIL CHARGES IN DAMAGES IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY SO ABOUT FIVE YEARS LATER WITH A SIXTY MILLION DOLLAR AWARD. AND YOU SAW OR HEARD FROM THE MINISTRY OR THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES CASE. RESOLVED I THINK IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT WAS A TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLAR CONSENT DECREE AWARD ON THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES SO. ABOUT EIGHTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S STILL INVOLVED A WHOLE SUITE OF CIVIL CLASS ACTION LITIGATION WHICH I THINK IS STILL GOING ON- AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A SERIES OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION CONNICK CLAIMS BROUGHT HERE AND- THE CURRENT EVENT. SO TO THE EXTENT ANY FAIR REFERENCE POINT YOU KNOW BY THIS YEAR'S. AND A LOT OF THE DYNAMICS AROUND REFUGIO AND SOME OF ITS STILL GOING. EVEN THANK YOU SERMON CENTER OVER. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU DIRECTOR BOTTOM IN ADMINISTRATOR CALLING- I VISITED THE COMMAND CENTER WITHIN THIRTY SIX HOURS I THINK OF BEING NOTIFIED DEPEND UPON HOW ONE DETERMINES THE NOTIFICATION AND I THINK ALL CALIFORNIANS WOULD BE IMPRESSED WITH THE ALACRITY AND THE PROFESSIONALISM IN WHICH- THE JOINT. FORCES RESPONDED IT WAS IT WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT OU ARE GATHERING LESSONS LEARNED FOR AN AFTER ACTION REPORT AT SOME POINT IN TIME. AND WHILE IT WAS CERTAINLY IMPRESSIVE TO ME A NO DOUBT WE CAN ALWAYS DO THINGS BETTER IN ORDER FOR US TO BE ABLE TO LIVE LEARN AND PROGRESS FROM THOSE LESSONS LEARNED- I WOULD ASK THAT IF YOU'RE COLLECTING THESE LESSONS AND I GET THAT THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES I GET THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE LITIGATION PROBABLY FOR YEARS TO COME- BUT WE ARE TASKED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY AS A CITY OUTSIDE THE- ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY FOR. HOW ALL OF THESE BILLS ARE PREVENTED AND HOW THEY CONTAINED AND HOW THEY CLEAN UP THAT IF YOU COULD GIVE US- IT MAY BE YOUR PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS BUT YOUR PRELIMINARY THOUGHTS BY. JANUARY AND I WOULD SUGGEST I'M PULLING THE STATES SOMEONE EARLIER JANUARY SEVEN SO THAT THAT WE CAN BEGN TO START TO. THINK ABOUT. BASED ON WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN AND HOW WE CAN DO THINGS BETTER- SO LET ME LET ME ASK BOTH OF YOU TO RESPOND TO IT AND I GET. THAT THINGS WON'T BE RESOLVED I GET THAT ALL INFORMATION WILL BE GATHERED I GET THAT. THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE EXACTLY COMPLETE SO LET ME START WITH YOU DIRECTOR BOTTLE. SO SENATOR I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LONG COMMITMENT TO. PUBLIC SERVICE AND I KNOW THAT YOU ARE A MORE QUALIFIED PROSECUTOR THAN I WILL EVER BE. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- SET UP YES I WOULD OFFER YOU MY PERSONAL WORD. THAT BETWEEN NOW AND THE BEGINNING IN JANUARY WE'D LIKE A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON SOME OF OUR INITIAL IMPRESSIONS. I THINK THROUGH WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN IMPROVE AND THEN COME BACK FOR A CONVERSATION WITH LEADERSHIP IN THE LEGISLATURE I. HOPE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR THAT KIND OF OPEN DOOR POLICY TO BE BETTER. IS A RELATIONSHIP I'VE ESTABLISHED WITH MANY OF YOU IN THOSE A FEW I DON'T KNOW YET I THINK THIS BILL- IS A PLACE IN WHICH I'D LIKE TO EARN THAT TRUST. SO LET LET ME JUST ASK A FOLLOW ON IT THEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID BUT- IF YOU COULD. LET US KNOW- WHATEVER IT IS WE CAN COME TOGETHER WHETHER IT'S BY JUNE WE SEVEN OR JANUARY. FOURTEENTH BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS AT LEAST I WOULD LIKE TO DO THIS EARLY ON SO THAT WE CAN- OPERATIONALIZE SOME SOME LESSONS THAT HAVE BEEN LEARNED. YES AND I THINK- STAYS APPROACH WOULD BE PRUDENT. WE PROBABLY WILL HAVE SOME INITIAL IDEAS WE MAY HAVE BETTER IDEAS IN THE SUBSEQUENT PHASES WE GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE ASSESSMENT TIMELINE. OR ANYTHING THANK YOU OF MR CALL. THANK YOU SENATOR I COULDN'T ADD ANYTHING MORE TO WHAT THE- THE DIRECTOR SAID YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE- VERY INTERESTED IN PROCEEDING SMARTLY ON ON TRYING TO IDENTIFY THOSE. THOSE ERRORS WE CAN DO BETTER AND WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING. FOR YOU BY JANUARY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND THEN LASTLY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THERE'S- VARIOUS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- IN RESTORATION THAT- ARE ENGAGED IN NEED TO BE ENGAGED AND WILL BE ENGAGED. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUR SUGGESTIONS- REFLECT UPON THINGS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COULD DO BETTER- WE WOULD WELCOME THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TELEPHONES HERE AND WE SEE- VIA EMAIL AND WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH OUR FEDERAL COLLEAGUES SO THAT THAT WOULD BE. THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THANK YOU INSTEAD OF INSTEAD. THE GREAT THANK CENTERBRIDGE CENTER THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND- THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU FOR INCREDIBLY COMPREHENSIVE- PRESENTATION AND I THINK I APPRECIATE AS WELL THE CENTER I'M BURKE SAID THE FACT THAT THEY'RE STILL MMHM SO MANY MOVING PIECES IN EITHER THE INVESTIGATION OF THE FOLLOW UP THAT IT'S HARD TO ANSWER CERTAIN THINGS NOW ADD OVER ONE MORNING MOST OF THE THINGS I WAS GONNA ASK BEEN ASKED BUT THERE ARE FEW RESIDUAL ONCE AND SO LET ME. JUST ASK AND- IT ADMINISTRATOR COLIN POWELL ONE THING YOU SAID IS THAT EVERY THREE YEARS THERE'S A TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE IN THERE TO LOOK OUT FOR THE UPDATE AND AT THE LAST ONE WAS IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR- DID YOU FEEL IT'S ALWAYS WHEN YOU HAVE A REAL SITUATION IT RAISES QUESTIONS THAT THAT IN THE ABSTRACT WORKED OUT WITH DO YOU THINK YOU WANNA. STEP UP TO THE NEXT ONE TO USE SOME LESSONS FROM THIS TO DECIDE IF THERE'S TECHNOLOGY THINGS THAT MIGHT ADDRESS THE SITUATIONS. BETTER FROM WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED HERE. THANK YOU SIR EARLIER IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN AND IT'S ACTUALLY EVERY TWO YEARS EVERY- OTHER FEBRUARY- BUT THE VALUE THAT WE CAME. FROM THAT ARM. GROUP IT COMES TOGETHER INSURANCE TECHNOLOGIES AND YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT THERE COULD BE THAT MANY EMERGING. KRUGMAN'S AND SAY CONTAINMENT OR- OR SORTED SET ABSORBED OIL BUT I'M ALWAYS IMPRESSED WITH HOW MUCH IS INVOLVING IN. REMOTE TECHNOLOGY IN OUR COMMUNICATIONS AND BEYOND WITH SAND AND SO FORTH AND SO I AM GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK ON TO MY TEAM AND I THINK CERTAINLY GIVEN THIS TO THIS EVENT WE PROBABLY SHOULD HOLD ANOTHER ONE SOONER AND WE WOULD PROBABLY BE WELL SERVED TO LOOK AT AN ANNUAL LIST POSTED BY DANIEL. GRAHAM THANK YOU AFTER THAT THAT'S REALLY RESPONSIVE AND THEN ARE PROBABLY CONTINUING WITH YOU. BOB WE HAD THE REFUGIO PIPELINE THING AND THEN AS A RESULT THERE WAS SOME LEGISLATION THAT CAME OUT OF IT IN CENTER REALLY MOUNTED A BILL IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THAT REALLY SAID IN THE EVENT OF AN OIL SPILL SOME OF THE AGENCIES WOULD BE REQUESTED TO DO PIECES OF THE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT TO AN ART D. A. THAT YOU REFERRED TO AND TO BE HONEST THE BOXES IN THE PRINT WERE SO SMALL I COULD SEE IF MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED. BUT I KNOW THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND I THINK IF IT'S IN THE BAY THE B. C. DC WERE REQUIRED TO DO. A PIECE OF THAT REPORT IN A WRITTEN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXTENT VALUE AND LEVEL OF DAMAGE OR INJURY HAVE THEY BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE AND ARE THEY WORKING ON THAT PIECE OF THE. AND- R. DA. I'M SORRY FIND MY BUTTON HERE- SO OBVIOUSLY BASED ON DC DC WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THIS RESPONSE OUR COASTAL COMMISSION HAS BEEN A PART OF OUR- INITIALLY DAILY AND NOW I'M BI WEEKLY. AGENCY CALLS ON THE I THINK IT WAS SENT BILL FOR FOURTEEN IF MEMORY SERVES WAS. INITIALLY AFTER REFUGIO THAT ON THAT ASK FOR MANY THINGS TO BE DONE- AND- ONE OF THOSE WAS A- AN EVALUATION ARE FIVE MAJOR COURTS SO THAT WOULD BE OUR HUMBLE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. ON A PORT WHEN AMY SAN DIEGO AND LA L. B. OF- OFFSHORE TOWING CAPABILITIES FOR THEIR ADDRESS WILL BECOME DISABLED AND ARE WHAT WOULD BE THE ORGANIC- HEAVY TOWING. R. K. W. VESSELS TO GO OUT. AND. I BELIEVE THAT THE- LL BE SEXIST INTO DIEGO ARE AND ON A STILL I BELIEVE. FOR COURT WILL NEED ME AND- AND HUMBOLDT BAY- IT SAID EARLIER SO ONE OF MY FIRST PHONE CALLS. IN THE BEGINNING PART OF THIS CURRENT SPELL WAS BOTH- TO THE CURRENT CHAIR THE COASTAL COMMISSION AS WELL AS ITS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I SEE. DOCTOR UNCLE BRIDGE HAS COME ON THE- WHETHER HAND RAISED. WHAT WE ALSO LEARN FROM REFUGIO DIFFERENT FROM THIS ONE WEEK BUT THERE WAS NO EXECUTIVE ORDER FROM THE GOVERNOR THAT- YOU KNOW CREATED EITHER A REAL OR PERCEIVED IMPINGEMENT ON COMMISSION AUTHORITIES AND THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS- PROCEEDING. AND OVER IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT WORLD. WE NEED ALL THE EXPERT SCIENTIFIC AND OTHERWISE WHETHER THEY'RE ACTUALLY DESIGNATED AS TRUSTEES OR NOT. AND THE COMMISSION IS ADVISING IN THAT SPACE I BELIEVE AS WELL BUT- I SURE START I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO CALL A DOCTOR OF THE BRIDGE OR SHE COULD PROBABLY TAKE THIS ON OUR PANEL AT THE END OF THE DAY RELATIVE TO SUNDERLAND'S QUESTIONS. HERE DR MICHAEL BRIDGET DO SEE THERE AND WELCOME I KNOW WE HAVE YOU SAVED FOR THE THIRD PANEL IF YOU A BRIEF RESPONSE THAT WILL ALLOW YOU TO WEIGH IN AND THEN WE CAN COME BACK FOR MORE. THOROUGH QUESTIONING AFTERWARDS. THANK YOU SENATOR I DID JUST WANT TO CONFIRM AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THAT AND THEN- PROCESS FROM THE BEGINNING WE GOT A CALL IMMEDIATELY FROM CDFW AND I'D LIKE TO THANK DIRECTOR VON AND- MINISTER CALLING FOR THAT- WE- HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN MEETINGS AS- WAS MENTIONED AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO. ADDING HER EXPERTISE- BOTH ON THE- WILDLIFE RESOURCES. BECAUSE THE RESOURCE IS RUNNING PUBLIC ACCESS. RIGHT THANK YOU MR THAT WAS RESPONSIVE AND THEN TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND LET ME GO. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT BUT SOMEBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE BOYS SYSTEM AND WE HAD A BUDGET ITEMS THIS YEAR. OF ABOUT STATE POLICE THAT WERE IN DANGER OF CONTINUING. AND WAS THERE ANYTHING WITH REGARD TO THE BELIEF SYSTEM THAT WAS A ST LOUIS OR WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AT RISK WE SHOULD FOLLOW UP ON AN ORDER OF PROCESSES NEXT YEAR. SEVERAL THAT I'M NOT. REALLY BEST POSITION ON THAT IT CAME UP I THINK IN ONE OF THE QUESTIONS FROM EITHER SENATOR MAN OR CENTER STAR JUST ABOUT TECHNOLOGY OFF SHORE- BUT I PERSONALLY AM REALLY NOT TRACKING THE BILLY DYNAMIC- SO WE WOULD BE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE. AFTER WE GET A CHANCE TO REFLECT ON THAT ASPECT R. ONE JURY JUST YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU'RE NOT PERSONALLY FOLLOWING UP WITH THE BULLY DYNAMIC AND- WE WILL GO WITH THAT N. LET'S FOLLOW UP BEFORE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET LAST QUESTION. HAS BEEN ASKED IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS AND JUST HASN'T BEEN ASKED THIS WAY. AND SO LET ME ASK BOTH OF YOU WAS THERE ANY TOOL THAT YOU WISH YOU HAD THIS RESPONSE THAT THUS FAR YOU'VE ASCERTAINED YOU DIDN'T HAVE THAT- MIGHT BE OF ASSISTANCE TO YOU. A LEGISLATIVELY BUDGETARY OR OTHERWISE ONE FOR ME. AND THIS IS IN THE SPIRIT F CANDOR. I THINK THE RESPONSE. AND THIS IS MY VIEW HAD CHALLENGES AND THAT FIRST TEN DAYS. FINDING A HOME FOR THE RESPONSE WHERE COULD YOU PUT THE AND THEN FIFTY TONS FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE. IN THE COMMAND I DON'T THINK IT WORKS FOR THE PUBLIC TRUSTS TO HOW'S THAT AND JUST SO THESE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY NO OFFENSE TO ANYONE'S RESPONSIBLE PARTY. AND I THINK WE CAN FIGURE OUT BEFORE SPELLS WHERE MIGHT BE. READILY ACCESSIBLE BY PUBLIC SPACE FOR A COMMAND TO POSITION ITSELF AND THAT WOULD HAVE SET ASIDE A HECK OF A LOT OF HASSLE AND THERE'S STILL. THEN IT MIGHT BE GOOD. IN THE TIME WE HAVE TO REFLECT. THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY PROPOSALS ON THAT THAT WE COULD WORK WITH THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. TO THE RESPONDING TEAM THAT WE DO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT IT MAKES SENSE TO ME THAT EVEN IF THE- RESPONSIBLE PARTY IS- IT IS. NOT REALLY EVENTUALLY AT FAULT IN SOME WAY IT IT APPEARS TO TAKE TO THE RESPONSE IF THAT'S WHAT COMES OUT OF FRONT. AND SO PLEASE OUR WORK WITH US IN A- AND ONE THING TO MENTION- I MEANT TO MENTION IN THE OPENING STATEMENT- I DID A BILL WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THERE WAS ORIGINALLY AN OIL SPILL RESPONSE LEGISLATION. OF THE FIRST 50% OF THE RESPONSE WOULD BE PAID FOR JUST RIGHT OUT OF THE POCKETS AND THEN THE SECOND FIFTY PERCENT. WOULD BE PAID FOR BY THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY EVEN THOUGH THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO THAT. IN IT WAS POTENTIALLY HAMPERING THE RESPONSE. TO BUILD THESE WHERE THEY WERE BUT SAID THAT THE STATE WOULD STEP UP AND NOT LET ANY ARBITRAGE WILL BURY OR- DELAY OR IMPINGE THE RESPONSE. OKAY AND I THINK THAT THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE- THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND HOW IT FITS AND HOW IT ALL WORKS AND ANIMAL WAS JUST IN THE ANSWER BOX OR TIES TO THAT SO- AND I UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WANT TO LEGISLATE EVERYTHING. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO FACILITATE ASSISTANCE SO THAT YOU'RE NOT IN THE MOMENT APPEARING TO ME MAKING A DECISION THAT REFLECTS ON SOMEBODY ELSE AND IF WE CAN MAKE A DECISION THAT USES THAT. ARE THEN OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET FEEDBACK ON SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR CONCERN. I THANK THE WITNESSES AND I REALLY THANK THE CHAIR FOR THE INDULGENCE OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK VERY THOROUGH QUESTIONING AND APPRECIATE ALL THE INCREASE I GUESS I WOULD JUST ADD TO WRAP THIS UP- IN THAT- WHAT WE'RE CALLING I GUESS A FEAST- BIT OF ASSESSMENT- OF SELF ASSESSMENT THAT WE'RE LOOK WILL BE LOOKING FOR IN JANUARY. I WOULD ALSO OFFER- AS SOME KIND OF REVIEW IN TERMS OF THE ADEQUACY OF THE- OF THE OSCAR FEE- I BELIEVE WE INDEXED IT AT EIGHT AND HAVE SINCE- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- ON A PER BARREL FEE SO EIGHT TO HALF CENTS PER BARREL AND THERE'S A CAP AT THIS POINT OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION. HI HEY I DID NOT GET A SENSE AT ALL FROM THE COAST GUARD THAT THEY WERE SPARING ANY EXPENSE AND WERE QUITE VIGILANT AND THROWING IN THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THE UNIFIED COMMAND. BUT BUT I AT THE YOU KNOW IN THIS CASE THE RATE OF RELEASE- WASN'T NEARLY AS BAD AS WE EXPECTED AND YOU KNOW BACK IN THE ENVELOPE MATH IF WE HAD A MORE THAN JUST THAT THIRTEEN INTERLINE FRACTURE THAT BAD DAY WHENEVER THIS HAPPENED- AND IF WE HAD BEEN AT THE RATE SAY OF HORIZON. AT THE BP SPILL- WHICH IS POSSIBLE STILL IN OUR OFFSHORE WATERS- IS OUR CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE SCOPE OF THAT SORT OF WORST CASE SCENARIO- WE MAY HAVE HAD SOME. SOME LUCK ON OUR SIDE SOME WEATHER ON OUR SIDE SOME OTHER THINGS WORKING IN OUR FAVOR IN ADDITION TO A LOT OF SWEAT AND HARD WORKING COORDINATION BUT I WOULDN'T EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE A IMMEDIATE REACTION TO THAT I WOULD. I WOULD ASK THAT- YOU'LL TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND YOU'RE SORT OF PHASE. ONE OF THIS INTERFACE HERE. WE WILL LOOK AT THAT. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH- WILL WRAP UP THIS PANEL THEN AND- THANK YOU BOTH FOR. YOUR WORK AND MOVE ON WITH- OUR STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES- SO I SEE WE HAVE MAYOR KERR HERE- AND AS WELL AS CHAIR FLETCHER WAS INDIA COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS- BRENDA WIKI PETE STAUFFER AND ANDREA LEON GROSSMANN- MAYOR KERR WHAT WE'LL START WITH YOU AND I WOULD JUST ASK WITNESSES- IF YOU CAN LIMIT YOUR TESTIMONY TO FIVE MINUTES I KNOW. MEMBERS WILL HAVE I'M SURE QUESTIONS FOR YOU IN SOME BACK AND FORTH SO- IF YOU CAN TRY TO KEEP IT IN THE FIVE MINUTE RANGE WOULD APPRECIATE IT. THEIR CAR WITHOUT FURTHER ADO. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I JUST REALLY WANTED TO THANK THE COMMISSION. FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER AND THE TICKET LITERALLY I WANT TO. EXTEND MY HEARTFELT THANKS TO SENATOR MEN AND SENATOR- BURKE THEY HAD BEEN WITH US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND THEIR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN GREATLY APPRECIATE IT SO- KNOWING THAT I HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME I DO WANT TO WALK EVERYBODY THROUGH- THE- POWER POINT PRESENTATION THAT I HAVE FOR YOU TODAY AND BASICALLY I JUST WANTED TO GIVE EVERYBODY. A QUICK OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH AND- AND A VERY SMALL WINDOW SO STARTING FF ON. SATURDAY OCTOBER SECOND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP THAT YES WE DID HAVE A VERY LARGE AIR SHOW HAPPENING THAT DAY ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE WERE ON THE BEACH THAT DAY. TO SEE THE PACIFIC AIR SHOW AND AROUND NINE O'CLOCK THAT MORNING- AND THERE WERE C. PERSONNEL THAT HEARD AN ANNOUNCEMENT ON VHF CHANNEL SIXTEEN BY THE COAST GUARD.A POSSIBLE OIL SPILL IN THE AREA BUT NOTHING VERY SPECIFIC AT THAT TIME NO MAJOR DETAILS IT WASN'T ANYTHING TO REALLY WORRY ABOUT. BY TEN THIRTY IN THE MORNING THE COAST GUARD HAD ADVISED US THAT THE SPELL WAS LARGER THAN ORIGINALLY THOUGHT. HOWEVER WE DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION AS TO WHERE THE LOCATION OF THE- OF THE SPELL WAS. NOR OF THE SCOPE OF THE SITUATION. BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT SAME DAY THE COAST GUARD ADVISED US THAT IT WAS NOW GOING TO BE A MAJOR SPILL AND THAT THE INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM WAS BEING ACTIVATED- BUT ONCE. AGAIN NOT A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO US EXACTLY WHERE THE SPELL WAS THE SIZE OF IT- BUT WE KNEW THAT THIS WAS DEVELOPING RATHER QUICKLY. AND AGAIN WE HAVE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BEACH- DOZENS OF BOATS OUT THERE ACTUALLY I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY CLOSER TO A HUNDRED BUCKS OUT WATCHING THE. AIR SHOW THAT DAY I'M SO WE WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SINCE WE BEGIN TO. RALLY THE TROOPS TOGETHER TO SAY LOOK IF THIS BECOMES A REAL THING AT FOUR O'CLOCK TODAY WE'RE GOING TO DEPLOY A SOME OF OUR- MARINE OIL SPILL PROTOCOLS. WHICH MAY BE TO. PROTECT SOME OF OUR MOST ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE AREAS AND I MEAN TEN BEACH INCLUDING THE TALBERT INLET CHANNEL WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE TECH. THE BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS ENTERED SAYS NEAR THE WARNER FIRE STATION AND THE TALBERT MARSH WHICH IS AT THE VERY SOUTH AND- HUNTINGTON BEACH. NEAR BROOKHURST ST P. C. H. SO THEN BY TWO O'CLOCK THE COAST GUARD ADVISED THE CITY THAT. I DON'T KNOW A THING NOT TO WORRY AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT TO THROW ANYBODY UNDER THE BUS BUT THIS IS JUST REALLY AGAIN FIRST. TO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE IT WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. AND SO AT THAT TIME AT TWO O'CLOCK THE COAST GUARD HAD ADVISED US THAT THE OIL SPILL WOULD NOT BE REACHING THE SHORES OF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND SOME MONDAY OCTOBER FOURTH- AND AGAIN WE DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF INFORMATION AS TO. WHERE THE SPILL WAS WE KNEW IT WAS OFF OUR COAST AND WE DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE OR EXACTLY HOW LARGE THE STILL WEST. BUT THEN INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. JUST A HALF HOUR LATER. WE STARTED TO RECEIVE MESSAGES THAT THERE WERE BOATS THAT WERE EXPERIENCING OIL DAMAGE JUST OUTSIDE OF THE AIR SHOWS LIGHT BOX. AND SO THAT BECAME A CONCERN FOR OUR CITY SO THEN WE ACTIVATED OUR FIRE CREWS ARE HAS NOT SEEN OR ORAL OUR DEEP OIL SPILL RESPONSE TRAILER. AND STARTED TO DO THE MITIGATION. EFFORTS UP TO TECH. THIS IS WHY IT GETS TO ME A VERY INTERESTING AT TWO FORTY FIVE THE CITY WAS NOTIFIED BY THE NEWPORT BEACH RESCUE BATTLE. BUT THERE WERE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS CONDUCTING OIL SPILL CLEANUPS. OUTSIDE AT THE AIR SHOW FLIGHT BOX. NOW AGAIN WE WERE BEING TOLD THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT ARRIVE ON OUR SHORES UNTIL MONDAY OCTOBER FOURTH BUT THERE WAS ACTIVE WE HAVE GOING ON AT THAT TIME AT TWO FORTY FIVE JUST SOUTH OF HUNTINGTON BEACH- AND SO AGAIN THIS IS GOING TO BE. FOR FALL DOWN BY FOUR O'CLOCK WE HAD LAID- SOFT LOANS AT THE BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS- AGAIN MORE BLOOMS AT THE WARNER BRIDGE T. C. H. ADDITIONAL BOMBS AT THE WARNER FIRE STATION AND THEN AT THE TOP OR MARCH. BY FOUR FORTY FIVE- THE CITY HAD MADE A DECISION TO CLOSE THE HUNTINGTON BEACH BEACHES FROM THE PIER ALL THE WAY SOUTH TO THE RIVER JETTY AND THEN THE STATE PARKS ALSO MADE THAT SIMILAR CLOSURE. FOR THE STATE PARK IN HUNTINGTON BEACH- BY FIVE THIRTY THE STATE PARKS HAD REPORTED THAT OIL WAS BEING SEEN THREE HUNDRED YARDS OFF OF THE SERVICE LINE NEAR MAGNOLIA AND BROKERS. AND THEN AT THIS TIME WE REACHED OUT TO SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES AND AGENCIES FOR ADDITIONAL HELP INCLUDING ANAHEIM AND ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY. BY SIX TEN- THE CITY CONDUCTED AN AERIAL SURVEILLANCE WITH OUR POLICE OFF- HELICOPTERS AND WE WERE ABLE TO DETERMINE THAT THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL STRETCH- FROM THE BIBLE APPEARED TO HUNTINGTON BEACH IN NEW LYNCH STREET- AT THAT TIME IT WAS ESTIMATED THAT THE OIL SPILL WAS AROUND TWO POINT EIGHT NAUTICAL MILES OFF THE COAST AND STRETCHED BY POINT EIGHT NAUTICAL MILES IN LENGTH- AND THEN. FINALLY BY SEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING AND AGAIN THIS IS LESS THAN TWELVE HOURS OF KNOWING THAT THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL SOMEWHERE OFF THE COAST OIL WAS HITTING THE SHORES AT HUNTINGTON BEACH. AND SOI KNOW THAT A PICTURE SPEAKS MORE THAN A THOUSAND WORDS I WANTED TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT OF WHAT WE WERE SEEN. THIS WAS AGAIN ON SATURDAY NIGHT ABOUT AND CLOCK WE COULD SEE THE- COMING UP ON THIS. OF TO. YEAH THIS IS IT ANOTHER NIGHT TIME PICTURE OF THAT TAR BALLS THAT WE RE SEEING. THIS WAS THE NEXT MORNING SATURDAY MORNING AND YOU CAN SEE OUR ICONIC HERE THEY ARE WITH THE OIL SHEEN. AGAIN SOME MORE PHOTOS THAT WE TOOK FROM OUR POLICE HELICOPTERS. THIS IS WHAT WE WOKE UP TO ON SATURDAY MORNING- AGAINWE WERE HOPING TO HAVE OUR EXCUSE ME SUNDAY MORNING WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF THE AIR SOW WITH ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE ON THE BEACH BUT WE HAD CANCELED IT THE NIGHT BEFORE. AT AROUND ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT- KNOWING THAT THIS WAS. GOING TO BE VERY IMPACTFUL- AND I AM SURE THE DIRECTOR BONHAM HAS SEEN THIS PICTURE A THOUSAND TIMES. THE BIRDS THAT THE WILDLIFE THAT WE SAW. AND THEY HAD MORE EXAMPLES THIS IS- SOUTH MORE THIS IS CLOSER TO NEWPORT BEACH WHERE WE SAW THE SOME WASHING UP ON THE SHORES. AGAIN MORE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING AND THEN THIS IS- APART AND HE- TAYLOR MARSH. AGAIN MORE WAVES COMING AND- SO STOP SHARING MY SCREEN NOW. AND SO BASICALLY FOR US WE I THINK THAT THE TAKE AWAY FOR US AND WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING WAS THAT IT REALLY FOR US THE NOTIFICATION OF SORTS THAT WE'VE HAD SOME TIME TO REFLECT ON THIS WHAT WE COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WHAT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN- AN OPPORTUNITY WHAT IS PERHAPS IF THE COAST GUARD HAD SOME SORT OF AWARENESS- THE NIGHT BEFORE OR- TO LET US KNOW SO WHEN AT NINE O'CLOCK. A NOTIFICATION CAME THROUGH WE COULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE PROACTIVE BECAUSE AS IT SAID IT BEFORE- EVERY HOUR COUNTS DURING THE- DURING THIS CRISIS BUT I AGAIN I JUST REALLY WANT TO EXTEND MY HEARTFELT THANKS TO EVERYBODY OUT THE COAST GUARD THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE OSCAR IS TRULY HAS BEEN AN ALL HANDS ON DECK EXPERIENCE- WELL IT WAS REALLY CHAOTIC FOR THE PROBABLY THE FIRST THIRTY SIX HOURS ONCE EVERYBODY WAS MOBILIZED AND PUT INTO PLACE. THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS WE WENT FROM HAVING MAYBE A HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE BEACH CLEANING OUR SHORELINES AND THEN IT QUICKLY JUMPED TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWO EIGHT HUNDRED AND THEN TO FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND SO WE SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WE WERE ABLE TO RE OPEN OUR BEACHES WITHIN EIGHT DAYS- FORTUNATELY THE WATER WAS CLEAN WE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAD. TO MITIGATE THE DAMAGE- THE ALSO SHE GOT LIKE A LOGICAL RESERVED WAS SPARED BUT TALBERT MARSH DOES HAVE OIL DAMAGE- AND AGAIN LOOKING BACK IF WE COULD HAVE HAD MAYBE A FEW MORE HOURS NOTICE WE PROBABLY COULD HAVE MITIGATED THAT DAMAGED EVEN MORE THAN WHAT WE DID BUT- I AM VERY VERY GRATEFUL TO YOU IS THIS COMMITTEE FOR TAKING SUCH TIME AND ENERGY TO REALLY LOOK AT. ALL. OF THE ELEMENTS THAT WENT INTO THE HE- A HOW WE MAYBE BETTER BECAUSE- AS SENATOR MENDEZ. OUT IT'S NAIVE TO THINK THAT THE SPELLS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN- I HOPE IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN YOUR BACKYARD- IT IS INCREDIBLY PAINFUL FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO GO THROUGH THIS. BUT THE OUTPOURING OF SUPPORT THAT I'VE SEEN MY RESIDENCE- COMMIT TO HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING. TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE JUST IN TWO DAYS WE WERE ABLE TO RAISE FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE WETLANDS AND WILDLIFE CARE CENTER- OUR OUR RESIDENTS ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THEIR BEACHES- I LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE SALT WATER THAT CONTINUALLY RUNS THERE ARE GAMES. AND AS FAR AS DEPICTING YOU KNOW- I KNOW THEY CAME OUT THE WEATHER WHICH SIDE OF THE BEACHES IS PREFERENTIAL- BETWEEN SENATOR MEN AND CENTERED AROUND ART I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF SERVERS HAVE THAT SAME DIALOGUE WHETHER IT'S CLIFFS DOG BEACH. NORTH SIDE OF THE PIER SOUTH SIDE OF THE PIER AND SENATOR LAYERED WE WILL GET INTO WHICH SERVER CITY IS BETTER BUT I'LL JUST SAY I MEAN TENS. BUT NEVER THE LESS I THINK THAT- WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS AND WHAT WE CAN DO TO BE EVEN BETTER- IS REALLY REALLY VALUABLE- AND IF I HAVE TIME I JUST WANT TO. SAY ONE QUICK SENTENCE ARE OF LOW QUICK STORY THAT SENATOR MAN HAD TOUCHED UPON BEFORE AS FAR AS BEING PREPARED AND YOU KNOW YOU CREATE YOUR OWN LUCK AND WE WERE VERY LUCKY WITH THIS. OUR CITY WAS UNIQUELY PREPARED FOR THIS- IT. IN TWENTY TWENTY WE HAD A BOAT SINKING HUNTINGTON HARBOR WHICH REQUIRED US TO RE EVALUATE OUR OIL SPILL RESPONSE. AS A DIRECTOR BONHAM HAD MENTIONED WITH EVERY OIL SPILL YOU GET BETTER WELL WITH THIS PARTICULAR MANY STILL IN OUR HUNTINGTON HARBOR WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT WE HAD DEFICIENCIES WITHIN OUR OWN RESPONSE. SO OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR WE DID APPLY FOR GRANTS. AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE EQUIPMENT TWO MORE READILY RESPOND TO THE OR SPILL THAT HAD. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS. BUT WE WERE HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT IF THIS WAS A YEAR AGO WE LITERALLY JUST GOT THAT TRAILER AND A LOT OF THE PROTECTIVE BONE WITHIN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. SO I'M GRATEFUL FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THAT I THINK IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO MORE OUTREACH TO MAKE THESE PROGRAMS MORE READILY AVAILABLE- SO THAT CITIES LIKE MINE THAT. CAN PRETTY MUCH EXPECT THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN WE'LL BE MORE PREPARED IN THE FUTURE. AND WITH THAT I WILL LET THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE A PART OF THIS AND TO SHARE WHAT IT WAS LIKE- RIGHT HERE IN REAL TIME WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THANK YOU MAYOR KERR AND- WE- LET YOU GO OVER TIME BECAUSE WE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN TIP OF THE SPEAR ON THIS AND DEEPLY ENGAGED OUT FROM THE GET GO SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR FIRST HAND ACCOUNTS AND ALL YOUR- YOUR BRIEF LEADERSHIP ON BEHALF OF YOUR- CONSTITUENTS- I SEE CHAIR FLETCHER ON THE LINE- MISTER CHAIR- YOU WANNA. WEIGH IN HERE AND GIVE US A LITTLE SAN DIEGO PERSPECTIVE ON THINGS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SENATOR STERN THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING INVITING DISRESPECT INTENDED TO GO WE'VE GOT A OBVIOUSLY A VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY. WHILE WE WERE SEPARATED BY DISTANCE FROM THIS BUILT. IN BY TIME AND NOT SIGN IS WHAT GAVE US THE- THE OPPORTUNITY. TO REALLY START ACTIVATING EARLY- WE ARE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY UPON THE INITIATION OF THE SPELLING BATTED COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES STOPPING. IN THE UNIFIED COMMAND STRUCTURE ALONG BEACH- WE ARE ABLE TO CLOSELY MONITOR THE WEATHER OUT THERE STATE THAT THE TRACKING OF THIS DIRECTION AND NOT HEADING UP TE SPILL. BUT WE ALSO PUT AN EARLY REQUEST FOR OUR MOST SENSITIVE WILL GO INSTEAD AT THE END HABITAT AREAS EARLY REQUEST FOR BOMBING OFF FIVE DIFFERENT WHEEL GUNS WE WERE ABLE TO GET BOMBS. WERE PROTECTING SOME OF OUR MOST VITAL WETLANDS INCLUDING. ONE OF THE START ONLY APPLY TO WHAT WHEN BUT IS ALSO THE INTAKE SITE FOR DESALINATION PLANT WHICH PROVIDES ABOUT 7% OF OUR REGION'S WATER- AND WE'RE INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL- IT'S YOU COAST GUARD CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- RESPONDED VERY QUICKLY TO OUR REQUESTS OFTEN TWO OR PROPHYLACTIC BEFORE WE EVEN. HAD AN AWARENESS IT WAS HERE BUT THEY WERE WILLING TO ENGAGE WITH US WE ACTIVATED OUR COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WHICH BROUGHT IN ALL OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE THE CITIES ALONG THE COASTLINE. OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS OUR STATE PARTNERS OUR COUNTY GOVERNMENT- AND CAN BE IN THE DAILY TRACKING THE CALLS AND UPDATING OUR PARTS ARE ALSO BROUGHT TOGETHER VERY EFFECTIVELY OUR COASTAL ELECTED OFFICIALS ALONG WITH RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES. AND SO IN GENERAL WHAT WE WERE IMPACTED WITH MARBLES- WE DID HAVE- SOME PRETTY LARGE NUMBERS FOR US IN SAN DIEGO SIGNIFICANT TROUBLES COME UP ON OUR BEACHES- WE DID NOT SEE THE OIL SHEENS ARE WE DIDN'T SEE THE SAME. ARE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THAT THAT ORANGE COUNTY GET- BUT THERE ARE STILL ROCK CONCERTS- THERE'S A REAL CONCERN. ONGOING THAT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN WINDS ARE CERTAINLY WILL TERM CONCERNS FOR FISHERY. OUR BEACH. CONCERN FOR YOU OVERALL TO ECONOMY IT'S A WHAT IT MEANS FOR OCEAN I THINK. YOU THOUGH WE NOT SEE AS- IMPACT IN INSTEAD COUNTY. WE HAD ANOTHER INSTANCE OF ANOTHER OIL SPILL OFF FORCING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONFRONT THE REALITY OF POLLUTION IN OUR BEACHES AND BAYS THAT SHOULD NOT BE THERE- AND I THINK THIS IS A POWERFUL REMINDER OF. THE REALITY THAT THE RISK IS NEVER BEEN BURKE. THE REWARD FOR OFFSHORE DRILLING- AND YOU KNOW TIME AND AGAIN WE SEE. AS LONG AS OFF WE'RE DOING THIS ALL OUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE. ALL THESE TYPES OF WEEKS THESE TYPE OF ACCIDENTS YOU START. ACTS ARE ARE BORING LIFE. OUR FISHERIES ON OUR ECONOMY ON OUR BEACHES AND BAYS- AND I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE SOME MECHANISM FOR REIMBURSEMENT AS. IT RELATES TO THE FUNCTION OF THIS. BUT I'D BE HARD PRESSED TO SHOW YOU EVER- ECOLOGICAL DISASTER READY ACTUAL PROPERTY INTO T. TRULY PAID FOR THE FULL COST OF THE RECOVERY. ARE WE HAVE THIS ONGOING TENDENCY TO PRIVATIZE PROFIT AND SOCIALIZED. THE COSTS. ASSOCIATED WITH WITH ON THAT PROFIT GENERATING ENTERPRISE GOES WRONG. AND SO YOU KNOW AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD I'M HOPING THIS DOESN'T BECOME ANOTHER ANGLE ON WHAT JUST YOUNG. DEEPWATER HORIZON EXXON VALDEZ ON AND ON AND ON WITH THE COMMUNITIES IMPACTED. ARE NOT PROPERLY COMPENSATED TAKE ACCOUNT AND THE PROFIT GENERATED YOU GET OUR PRICE GOES ON TO CONTINUE TO REAP. TREMENDOUS PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK. THAT THE UPPER YOU'RE DOING HERE I THINK THE LEADERSHIP THAT'S BEING SHOWN- TO REALLY DIVE INTO THE SMALL TOWN OF BILL IS REALLY IMPORANT I'LL TELL. YOU MY FINAL POINT SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ARE WE ARE A RE DECARBONISE. PLAN TO ACHIEVE A CARBON ZERO ECONOMY BY BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND A PART OF THAT IS MOVING OFF OF THE OIL. AND I THINK A PART OF THAT IS GOT TO BE ASSISTED CONTINUING EVERYTHING WE CAN'T ALL THOSE FEDERAL LEASES UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY'RE DISTINCT FROM STATE GOVERNMENT- BUT YOU WANT TO FREEZE OUT OF THESE- AND THEN AS WE DO THAT BEING VERY MINDFUL. OF HELLO. IT WILL IMPACT ON WORKERS AND AS WE SEGMENT OUT OF ONE INDUSTRY IN INTO ANOTHER DUE DATE THAT BURDEN THAT IS ON ALL OF US. TO ENSURE THAT THOSE ARE GOOD JOBS GOOD MIDDLE CLASS JOBS- SO THAT AS WE GO ON THE PATH TO TACKLING ISSUES OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE NOT EXACERBATING ISSUES OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE. THE DECLINE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS WORKER ISSUES REALLY PROTECTING US COULD YOU JOB SO. AGAIN SERIOUSLY NOT IMPACTED NEARLY AS SEVERE ANYWAY AS FAR AS COUNTY- BUT- YOU KNOW WE DID. HAVE TO GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF ACTIONS WE CONTINUE TO HAVE TROUBLES- IT CLEAN UP TEAMS DEPLOYED ALONG THE SHORE ONCE CLOSE TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY. ARE RESPONDING TO THIS MORE LIKELY TO FACE OFF FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR USFOR LETTING ME JOIN YOUR I LOOK. FORWARD TO WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN. IN THANK YOU YOUR FIRST. ED AND- FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP NOT JUST ON THE ISSUE BUT- ON. INDEED GENERALLY ST- REMARK PRAGUE IN THE PAST YEARS HERE- MR NO WIKI ARE YOU WITH US I THINK WE HAVE YOU NEXT ON THE AGENDA HERE THAT THE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY DIVERSITY BRIAN THE WIKI IF YOU'RE WITH US- PLEASE TRY I'M HERE. WELCOME TO ME. YES ALL RIGHT WE GOT JOB. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARES NUMBERS OF MANY IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU ALL VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS A THOROUGH DISCUSSION RIGHT AWAY HE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY- THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THE HEARING ON THIS. ISSUE LIKE ALL OF YOU AT THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ARE HEARTBROKEN BY EVERY OILED SEABIRDS WERE ALARMED AT THE MILES OF MARCHES AND COASTLINE THAT WILL BE PRESENT FOR YEARS BY THE SPELL WE WERE ANGRY THAT YET AGAIN THE OIL INDUSTRY HAS PROVEN ITS INABILITY TO CONTAIN ITS TOXIC POLLUTION. THE STRUCTURE QUITE QUITE OFTEN IN THE FUTURE CREWS YET AGAIN THAT EVERY PIECE OF FOSSIL FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE IS YET ANOTHER DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN. AND THERE IS A LOT OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. RECENTLY OLD UPDATED IN DISREPAIR AND POORLY LOCATED LIKE THE FORTY YEAR OLD PIPELINE THEY GIVE US THIS MOST RECENT SPELL. ALL OF WHICH MAKES IT INCREASINGLY DANGEROUS. LOOKING BEYOND THE NINE OIL PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS AND STATE WATER. THERE ARE TWENTY THREE PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS OFF CALIFORNIA. BUT THE FACT THAT THIS TWENTY THREE PLATFORMS ARE A LITTLE FARTHER FROM SHORE SHOULD NOT GIVE US MUCH COMFORT FIRST BECAUSE OIL SPILLS FROM THOSE OPERATIONS STILL END UP IN OUR WATER OUR BEACHES AND OUR WILDLIFE. BUT ALSO AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY FURTHER FROM SHORE. ALSO MEANS UNDER STRETCHES OF AGING AND DANGEROUSLY VULNERABLE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THE SEVENTEEN MILE LONG PIPELINE WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY. MARK WE RELY ON FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO PROTECT US FROM OIL SPILLS IN FEDERAL WATERS. FEDERAL REGULATORS CONTINUE TO PROVE THAT THEY ARE PERFECTLY WILLING TO ALLOW THOSE PLATFORMS TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE LAST DROP OF OIL. DESPITE THE MOUNTING DANGERS OF DECAYING INFRASTRUCTURE WELL BEYOND ITS INTENDED LIFESPAN. OUTDATED DRILLING PLANS NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS AND INSUFFICIENT FUNDS THE PAPER DECOMMISSIONING. JUST THIS YEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE ISSUED A SCATHING REPORT BUT FEDERAL REGULATORS LACK ROBUST SYSTEM OF DETECTING LEAKS. FROM EIGHTY SIX HUNDRED MILES OF ACTIVE OFFSHORE PLATFORMS. THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR COAST FROM THIS DANGEROUS ON LIVING INDUSTRY IS THAT SHOPPERS OFFSHORE OPERATIONS DOWN. BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM UNIQUE OFFSHORE PLATFORMS. AT THE EXACT SAME TIME ENDS UP THOUSANDS OF GALLONS OF OIL WERE ROLLING UP ON COULD BEACHES AND MARSHES. IN ORANGE COUNTY. THERE WAS AN OIL SPILL IN CURRENT COUNTY THAT IS NOW APPROACHING FIVE MILLION GALLONS OF FLUID A MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL. EXIT WASTE WATER THAT INCLUDES. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS OF CRUDE. YEAH IN JUST LAST YEAR. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OIL IN HELP BRING GREATER THAN THE STOCK I THINK IF. IN THE SUMMER YOU KNOW THE LOAN THERE WERE THREE HUGE SALES IN TWENTY NINETEEN FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS. EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX THOUSAND ONE POINT TWO MILLION GALLONS ACTIVELY. HUNDRED FIFTY NINE THOUSAND MIDWAY TWENTY NINETEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ETHNIC HATRED COMPLAIN PLANNING. THERE IS ANOTHER ONGOING. SPELL THE SEPARATOR PLANT IN SUMMER. THAT HAS BEEN LEAKING SINCE TWO. THREE AND IS REPORTEDLY RELEASED AS MUCH AS EIGHTY FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF WITHIN DAY. BUT THESE NUMBERS REFLECT TOTAL COMBINED VOLUMES GREW IN PRODUCED WATER AND MUD WHICH CONSTITUTE TOXIC MIXED. THE STATE. AGENCIES ARE TESTIFIED BEFORE THIS LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST THESE DANGEROUS ON SHORE OIL OPERATIONS HAVE CONTAMINATED GROUND WATER LAND WILDLIFE. AFTER MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF THE AUTO INDUSTRY DRILLING AT WILL IN CALIFORNIA THESE YOUR LIST ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL THAT'S LEFT IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS EXTRACT. IS ALSO SOME OF THE MOST CARBON POLLUTING ROUTE IN THE WORLD. THE EASY STUFF TAKEN THE OIL INDUSTRY IS IN DECLINE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT PRODUCTION DOWN THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW MUCH MORE DAMAGE WELL THIS DYING INDUSTRY GIL ON ITS WAY OUT. WE APPLAUD GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF A DRAFT RULE THE BAND KNEW BOYLE WELLS NEAR HOUSES AND SCHOOLS. IT'S A GREAT STEP TOWARD PROTECTING THOSECALIFORNIANS BURDENED WITH SOME OF THE GREATEST POLLUTION CALIFORNIA'S OIL INDUSTRY. BUT THE STATE HAS ISSUED PERMITS FOR MORE THAN. FIVE THOUSAND WELLS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. FIVE OF THOSE NEW WELLS- INTERSTATE OFFSHORE WATERS. ALONG WITH UNDER OVER ONE HUNDRED THIRTY ADDITIONAL PERMITS TO REWORK WELLS IN STATE WATERS TO KEEP THEM GOING. THERE IS ONLY ONE SOLUTION TO THIS MASSIVE AND GROWING THREAT. STOPPED ISSUING NEW PERMITS. AND REQUIRING OIL COMPANIES T CAPTURE. CLEAN UP AND REMEDIATE OIL SITES AS THEY ARE LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK HERE TODAY. THANK YOU MR NIKE- NEXT WE HAVE STUFF FOR- THE ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTOR FOR THE SURFRIDER FOUNDATION WELCOME. SHARE STERN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY MY NAME IS PETE STOPPED WORKING I MEAN FIRE MENTAL DIRECTOR OF SURFRIDER FOUNDATION. THE SURFRIDER IS A GRASSROOTS ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO THE PROTECTION AND ENJOYMENT OF OCEAN WAVES AND BEACHES FOR ALL PEOPLE. THE APPLE PIE ENERGY OIL SPILL THAT OCCURRED OFF ORANGE COUNTY CALIFORNIA ALSO KNOWN AS THE ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS THE AUSSIE MEN IN TONGA PEOPLE'S RESULTED IN A THIRTEEN SQUARE MILE OIL SLICK. CONTINUES TO DAMAGE THE MARINE AND COASTAL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES BUSINESSES AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. AS THE NGO LIAISON TO THE UNIFIED COMMAND SURFRIDER HAS BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING THE CLEAN UP AFTER. WE EXPRESS OUR SINCERE GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THE TRAIN PROFESSIONALS AND VOLUNTEERS WHOSE QUICK AND DECISIVE RESPONSE HAS PREVENTED IT IT IS ASTOR FROM BEING MUCH WORSE. THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OIL SPILL HAS PRESENTED A TOXIC HAZARD TO MARINE WILDLIFE AND OCEAN HEALTH WHILE ALSO PENETRATING TALBERT MARSH ALSO CHICA WETLANDS AND OTHER ECOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT HABITATS. NOW WITH OIL DEPOSITS SEEN AS FAR SOUTH AS THE MEXICO BORDER THEIR CONCERNS THAT SAN DIEGO WEAPONS. ARE ALSO BEING IMPACTED. MOREOVER WALDBURG FISH MARINE MAMMALS HAVE BEEN THE MOST VISIBLY IMPACTED. THE FULL SCALE OF THE ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO BECOME CLEAR. IN THE WEEKS SINCE THIS BILL OF AN OIL SLICK IS TRANSFORMED INTO AN INCALCULABLE NUMBER OF TAR BALLS IN THE OCEAN. PAUL TAR BALLS TYPICALLY FLOWS THEY CAN ALSO FIND THEIR WAY INTO UNDERWATER SEDIMENT OR NEAR SHORE HABITATS WEATHER IMPACTS ON ECOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WILDLIFE MAY PERSIST FOR YEARS OR EVEN DECADES. TO ASSIST WITH THE TRACKING OF TAR BALLS SURFRIDER LAUNCHED A SMARTPHONE APP TO ALLOW USERS TO EASILY SUBMIT PHOTOS INTO A CROWD SOURCED MAP. THIS DATA IS BEING SHARED WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE TO INFORM UNIFIED COMMAND RESPONSE. THE TOOL ALSO PROVIDES A TANGIBLE WAY FOR THOUSANDS OF INTERESTED VOLUNTEERS TO SAFELY TAKE ACTION. YES THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OIL SPILL WITH NOT JUST AN ENVIRONMENTAL CATASTROPHE IT WAS A HUMAN ONE AS WELL. THIS BILL HAS CAUSED DAMAGING IMPACTS THE COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMY IN ORANGE COUNTY AND BEYOND. IN THE IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH OF THE SPELL IT IS CENTRED KERR SHOW AND THE HUNTINGTON BEACH SURF CONTESTS EVENTS THAT DRAW ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE TO THE COAST. OR CANCEL. IT'S STILL ALSO RESULTED IN THE IMMEDIATE CLOSURE OF BEACHES HARBORS AND FISHING GROUNDS OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH NEWPORT BEACH LAGUNA BEACH IN DANA POINT. THESE THESE BEACHES REMAIN CLOSED FOR UP TO NINE DAYS UNTIL OFFICIALS COULD CONDUCT SUFFICIENT WATER QUALITY MONITORING TO DETERMINE IT WAS SAFE FOR THE PUBLIC. THE CLOSING OF MILES OF BEACHES AND FISHING GROUNDS HAS BEEN A DEVASTATING BLOW TO ORANGE COUNTY'S OCEAN RECREATION AND TOURISM ECONOMY WHICH IS VALUED AT MORE THAN TWO POINT SIX BILLION ANNUALLY. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL OCEAN ECONOMICS PROGRAM. FROM RESTAURANTS AND HOTELS TO SURF SHOPS LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS I FELT THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF BEACH CLOSURES AND EVENT CANCELLATIONS. AMONG THE BUSINESS LEADERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN OUT IS PAUL NOT DAY PRESIDENT OF THE SURF INDUSTRY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION OR SEMA. SEMA MEMBERS COLLECTIVELY EMPLOY OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH NEARLY 90% OF THE SURF INDUSTRIES MANUFACTURES BASED IN ORANGE COUNTY. SEND OUT A FOLLOWING THE OIL SPILL IS THE REST OFFSHORE DRILLING POSES TO THE CALIFORNIA BEACH LIFESTYLE AND MANY PEOPLE AND BUSINESS SECTORS THAT RELY ON IT INCLUDING TOURISM REALLY WORTH IT. IN MY OPINION ABSOLUTELY NOT. MEANWHILE THE FISHERIES CLOSURES STILL REMAINS IN EFFECT AT THE SEAFOOD SAFETY UNIT CONTINUES TO CONDUCT FISH SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS. THE CLOSURE IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED FISHING TOUR OPERATORS ALONG WITH GAS STOCKS THAT HAVE SEEN LARGE DROPS IN FUEL SALES. BEASTIES HARBOR IMPACTS HAVE ALSO EXTENDED TO WHALE WATCH TOUR OPERATORS AND OTHER BUSINESSES ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN DAVE'S DOLPHIN AND WHALE WATCHING SAFARI LOSSES FROM TRIPS AND BOOKINGS INTO NOVEMBER COULD BE DOWN AS MUCH AS SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. BECAUSE OF THE OIL SPILL. SADLY THIS DEVASTATING OIL SPILL IS PART OF A LARGER PATTERN OF OFFSHORE DRILLING HARMING OUR COASTAL ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ERIC VAN AT LEAST FORTY FOUR OIL SPILL SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. AT EACH RELEASED MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF OIL INTO U. S. WATERS. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT OFFSHORE DRILLING IS OVERWHELMINGLY OPPOSED BY BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES THE BUSINESS ALLIANCE FOR PROTECTING THE PACIFIC COAST OR BAIT PACK WAS FOUNDED IN ORANGE COUNTY TO DEMONSTRATE BUSINESS OPPOSITION TO OFFSHORE DRILLING. JACK IS JOINED BY BUSINESS ALLIANCES ON THE EAST COAST AND GULF COAST COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT MORE THAN FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND BUSINESSES. ON OCTOBER NINETEENTH SEVENTEEN DAYS AFTER THE SPILL BEGAN THE CITY OF HUNTINGTON BEACH PASSED A LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOLUTION IN OPPOSITION TO OFFSHORE DRILLING MARKING THE ONE HUNDREDTH LOCAL RESOLUTION PASSED ON THE WEST COAST. THIS SENDS A CLEAR MESSAGE FROM COMMUNITIES UNDERSCORES IT'S TIME FOR OUR FEDERAL LEADERS TO PASS LEGISLATION TO BAN NEW OFFSHORE DRILLING. LEADERSHIP AT THE STATE LEVEL IS ALSO CRITICAL SPECIFICALLY STATE LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE SAFE AND SWIFT DECOMMISSIONING OF EXISTING OIL RIGS OFF CALIFORNIA. THE LEADERSHIP IS ALSO NEEDED TO END OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS ON LAND AS WELL TO PROTECT FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES PUBLIC HEALTH AND ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TO THAT. THANK YOU MR ROBERT- NEXT WE HAVE A MUSLIM GROSSMAN DIRECTOR OF CLIMATE ACTION FOR US WHO ARE YOU WITH US HERE. YES I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WELCOME. HI HELLO MY NAME IS ANDREA LEON GROSSMANN AND THE CLIMATE ACTION DIRECTOR WITH A SOUL A GRASSROOTS ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION WORKING TO PROTECT OUR COASTS AND OCEAN I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE FOR HOSTING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. WHEN I ARRIVED IN HUNTINGTON BEACH ON SUNDAY OCTOBER THIRD. I COULD SMELL THE OIL. AND AS I GOT OUT OF THE CARD NEXT TO THE LAGOON I COULD SEE THE BALLOONS THAT WERE DEPLOYED. THE HOUSE BUT WERE CONSTRAINED TO SCAN SOME OF THE OIL BUT THE MOST HEARTBREAKING PART WAS WATCHING THE FISH. AND THE FIRST LANDING ON TOP OF THE CONTAMINATED MARSH. AFTER SPEAKING TO THE FIRST TV REPORTER WHO WAS THERE REPORTING IN SPANISH. I WENT TO THE COASTLINE TO SEE HOW BAD THIS BILL WAS THERE. I SAW THE TAR BALLS WASHING ASHORE EVERYWHERE. AND THE BEACH THE BEACH WAS NOT FULLY CLOSED. SINCE IT WAS A SOFT SOFT CLOSURE THERE WERE STILL FAMILIES SPENDING THE DAY AT THE BEACH. AND GOING INTO THE- THE WATER. I KNEW THAT THAT WAS- I WAS ONLY SEEING A FRACTION OF THE OIL AS MUCH OF THE OIL EXTRACTED IN CALIFORNIA IS HAVING AN- ANY SINKS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN. MANY OF THOSE TITLES ARE STILL WASHING ASHORE AT THIS VERY MOMENT AND MANY MORE WILL REMAIN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN POISONING AND KILLING SEA LIFE. AND THE TECHNIQUES WE USE TO CLEAN UP HAVE NOT REALLY CHANGED IN DECADES. WELL THE TREE DWELLING AND ENHANCE RECOVERY TECHNIQUES TO GET TO THE HYDROCARBONS ARE EVOLVING EVERY DAY. THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE TO HAPPEN. WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO GO A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY AND LEAVE THE OIL IN THE GROUND. THIS MAN MADE DISASTER FURTHER HURTS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS HE BEACH IS ONE OF THE FEW PLACES LOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN GO FOR FREE OR LOW COST RECREATION. WIESER STILL FIGHTING THE GROWING INEQUITIES THAT THE BUTTON THAT MAKES US SO DEEPLY EXACERBATED. AND MANY BUILDABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HURT BY THE OIL INDUSTRY BY ALLOWING THEM TO DRILL NEXT TO WHERE THEY LIVE WORK OR PLAY OR THE REFINING OR TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS TAKE PLACE. THIS BILL TOOK AWAY A PLACE. TO ACCESS NATURE AND MANY REMAIN WORRIED ABOUT THE- ONGOING ISSUES AT THE BEACH. WELL WE HAVE A GREAT NEW PROPOSAL TO STOP NEW TRAILING BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM THERE'S STILL A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH EXISTING. WELLS BOOK ON SHORE AND OFF SHORE. THESE WELLS SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN BUILT AND WE MUST BE COMMISSIONED THEM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE MANY CORPORATIONS KEEP DRILLING BECAUSE THEY ELECTIONS TOO EXPENSIVE THAT THE COMMISSION. EVEN WHEN OIL THE OIL THAT IS EXTRACTED IS LOW QUALITY AND EXPENSIVE TO REFINE. BUT THAT DISCUSSION DOES NOT CONSIDER THE TOTAL COST TO THE PUBLIC OF DRILLING OPERATIONS FROM CLEAN UP COSTS TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS ESPECIALLY WHEN CORPORATIONS WORK HARD TO MAXIMIZE PROFITS BY CUTTING CORNERS EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES. AND MANY MANY MANY END UP THE CLAIM BACK FROM SEA TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY AND SOCIALIZE THE LOSSES THE CLEANUP. HEALTH AND THE COMMISSIONING COSTS. PUBLIC HEALTH MUST COME FIRST AS WELL AS BIO DIVERSITY BUT RIGHT NOW CORPORATE PROFITS ARE TAKING PRIORITY AND THAT HAS GOT TO STOP. ALEX FRACTION REFINING AND BURNING CONTRIBUTES TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND CREATES HAS SACRIFICED STORMS BUT LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR NEXT. THE OCEAN IS NOT A PROFIT CENTER AND IT'S NOT A JOB IT'S AN ECOSYSTEM THAT NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED FROM DESTRUCTIVE ECONOMY TO ENSURE THAT IT CAN BE ENJOYED BY ALL CALIFORNIANS FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE TODAY WILL DEFINE WHAT KIND OF FUTURE WE HAVE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THE BOX UP WITH US RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW WE CAN BE AND MUST BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO BE PART OF THE SPARROW AND I'LL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- BUT THAT CONCLUDES OUR- FORMAL TESTIMONY FROM ALL THE STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES- MEMBERS DO YOU HAVE INITIAL QUESTIONS. HER FOR ANY OF OUR PANELISTS ARE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADERS OR OTHERWISE YES CENTER AMBER ANOTHER QUESTION BUT BUT JUST TO COMMENT WITH RESPECT TO- AMERICORPS- CINNAMON A NIGHT OF PERSONALLY OBSERVE MER CARS- MARSHALLING RESOURCES WHETHER IT WAS A QUICK MINT OR VOLUNTEERS INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION DURING THIS CRISIS AND I WANT TO COMMEND HER. FOR DOING SO OFTEN TIMES THINGS CAN GET BOTH CHAOTIC AND SOMETIMES- ACCURATE COMMUNICATION IS A CHALLENGE BUT I WANT T COMMEND MAYOR KERR FOR DOING BOTH ACCURATELY COMMUNICATING THE LEVEL OF THE CHALLENGE. AS WELL AS MARSHALING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEM SO THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THE SENTIMENT. ARIZONA ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS ON THE LEADERSHIP OF MAYOR KERR AS WELL AS OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO ATTEND TODAY- AND- I KNOW THAT ORANGE COUNTY WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED AS WELL BUT- I GUESS LIKE MY QUESTION FOR. REALLY ANY OF YOU AND I THINK I THINK THAT- P. YOU SPOKE BRIEFLY TO THIS ON THE SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE IT SEEMS THAT- MAYBE PREMIER KERR OR SUPERVISOR FLETCHER- IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THE ECONOMIC COSTS OF THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR CITIES OR COUNTIES- OF THE OIL SPILL THE SHUT DOWN OF OUR BEACHES LHASA TOURISM I THINK MAN KERR YOU SPOKE ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE LEAVING OBVIOUSLY THAT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY BUT- DO WE HAVE ANY INITIAL ESTIMATES. OF WHAT THE COST OF THIS OIL SPILL IS GONNA BE. WELL NOT ON THE- WHEN IT COMES TO THE TOURISM BUT I CAN TELL YOU I'M REALLY GRATEFUL THE FACT THAT WE HAVE THE SBA LOANS NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE. AN OUTCRY AND FROM OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES TO REALLY STOCKED UP- THAT FOR THAT PARTICULAR WEEKEND. WITH FOOD SUPPLIES- LABORER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY COULD ACCOMMODATE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION PEOPLE COMING. ON AN ADDITION WE- HAVE HEARD FEEDBACK FROM THE HOTELS. CANCELLATIONS PEOPLE CANCEL. THEIR TRIPS- AS WAS MENTIONED THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND WE HAD TO COUNSEL. OTHER EVENTS SURF CONTEST- AND OTHERACTIVITIES PLANNED. WE HAD A FEW DIFFERENT PLANS AND SO ALL OF THE HOTELS- EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT CANCELLATIONS WITH THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO FULLY SEE THE FULL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF ALL OF THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME. GIVEN THAT- YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY TOOK A REAL HIT ON ITS REPUTATION. AND SO WORD TRAVELS FAST WHEN THERE'S AN OIL SPILL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE MAY LOOK ELSE WISE TO BOOK THEIR TRIPS SO. IT'S GONNA BE SOMETIME AND I KNOW HERE IN THE CITY WE ARE- KEEPING RECEIPTS FOR EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE SPENT SO FAR. I KNOW WITHIN THE FIRST WEEK WE HAD SPENT OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ON. THE RESPONSE TO THE OIL SPILL SO I KNOW THOSE NUMBERS KEEP. ADDING UP IT. IT'LL BE SOME TIME BEFORE WE SEE THE FULL IMPACT AND HAVE YOUR HOTEL I MEAN I KNOW THE BEACHES ARE REOPENED AND I UNDERSTAND THINGS COULD BE BACK TO NORMAL. ARE YOU SAYING HOTELS BACK TO CAPACITY AND NORMAL SEASONAL LEVELS OR ARE YOU STILL EXPERIENCING SOME KIND OF A DROP OFF TO THE HOSPITAL NOW THERE THERE'S DEFINITELY BEEN A DROP OFF- AND IT IS THAT TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN THINGS DO YOU TYPICALLY DROP OFF BUT- WE CERTAINLY TOOK A HIT. FROM THIS OIL SPELL IT'S LOWER THAN NORMAL AND JUST A QUESTION I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO BUT- THE TOT TAX. ANOTHER TAX REVENUES THAT YOU'RE LOSING- IS THAT IS THAT'S- FROM THE LEVEL THERE'S- PARTY. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I HOPE THAT IT IS- BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH T. O. T. WE DO RECEIVE AND HUNTINGTON BEACH WE RECEIVE ABOUT SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR- WE DON'T RECEIVE ANYTHING FROM THOSE. OFF SHORE PLATFORMS. I THINK I'M GONNA START IS THE DRILLING THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE HERE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH IT'S LESS THAN SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR SO EVEN THOUGHOUR MASCOT AT THE HUNTINGTON BEACH HIGH SCHOOL AS THE OILERS THIS TOWN HAS REALLY PIVOTED FROM BEING AN OIL BOOMTOWN WHERE MUCH MORE OF A TOURIST TOWN WE RELY ON VISITORS COMING TO AN AGENT BEACH- IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR GENERAL FUND. SO- MAKE A FRIENDLY SUGGESTION PERHAPS YOU MIGHT CHANGE THE MASCOT OF THE SERVICE. IT HAS BEEN. BEEN SUGGESTED THANK YOU SENATOR ANYWAYS- INTENSIVE RISER FLETCHER AND IF YOU HAVE ANY SIMILAR COMMENTS I KNOW THAT YOUR COUNTY WAS NOT HIT AS HARD AND I THINK REPUTATION HE PROBABLY WAS NOT AS AFFECTED BUT IF YOU HAVE ANY. OBSERVATIONS ON ANY ECONOMIC IMPACT- BEFORE THE COUNTY I'D BE INTERESTED IN THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MEANT FOR THE QUESTION AGAIN WE WERE NOT IMPACTED NEARLY AS EARLY ON ANY ORDER BACK TO THE STORE. AS WHAT FOLKS IN ORANGE COUNTY EXPERIENCE. BUT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE. THERE'S NOTHING POSITIVE THAT COMES OUT OF THIS FOR ANY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY. AND SO YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE SOME MODEST COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVATING EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER WITH STAFF BEING. IS OBVIOUSLY SOME CROSSING COURT BY STATE AGENCIES AND OTHERS FOR THE DEPLOYMENT OF BONES THE CLEANUP TEAMS WERE DOWN HERE. BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR YOUR BEST BEACH. ARE YOUR BEACHES THAT PEOPLE TRAVEL FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD TO COME AND WHILE WE ARE. IN CARLSBAD AND ITS NEED IT'S UNTIL MARCH I DID IT BETTER ARE NATIONALLY BROADCAST WITH HARDBALL'S WASHING UP ON THE SHORE- THAT THAT DOES NOT HELP. IT DOESN'T HELP AT ALL AND SO I THINK AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. ON KNOWN LONGER TERM DAMAGE OFF WORK MARINE LIFE FOR HABITATS FOR ALL THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE THERE AND SO IT'S JUST AN INDUSTRY WHERE. FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENT STANDPOINT THERE IS NOTHING POSITIVE. ARE THERE WE EVER GET. OUT OF THE OFFSHORE OIL INDUSTRY IT IS ONLY NOW. AND IT ALWAYS TENDS TO COME OUT SO AGAIN NO WHERE NEAR WHAT ARE FOLKS OR SHOUTING WENT THROUGH- AND THE WAY THEY- REACTED AND DEALT WITH THIS IS ADMIRABLE AND REALLY TO BE COMMENDED- BUT BUT CERTAINLY NOTHING NOTHING POSITIVE CAN COME TO SAN DIEGO BECAUSE OF THIS. THANK YOU ROGER AND THEN FOR A MISTER NOBODY MISTER STUFFER AND MOSTLY GROSSMANN- I ACTUALLY LET ME LET ME JUST ONE MOMENT MR NO WIKI- IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THE ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS. ARE BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCES WITH VERY REFUGIO OR. OR OTHERWISE I MEAN HOW. WHAT DO WE KNOW YET WE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW BAD THIS WILL BE- AS FAR AS THE BIO. ENVIRONMENT IMPACTS. NO I'M DEFINITELY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S CRITICAL- THAT THESE IMPACTS. IN MY **** FOR YEARS BUT I NEED TO REMIND OTHER. I COLLEAGUES HERE THAT OTHER FOLKS ON THIS CALL BECAUSE- I'M LOOKING AT THIS VERY MUCH FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND WAS NOT ON THE GROUND BUT I CAN'T SAY THOUGH. FOR SURE IS THAT IS GOING TO TAKE LONGER THAN ONE SEASON TO SEE WHAT THE FULL IMPACT ARE YOU THE LOCAL WILDLIFE AND OF COURSE. IT IS WETLANDS AND MARSHES BUT OFTEN ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT AND TAKE THE LONGEST TO RECOVER FROM THE START OF IMPACTS BUT- BUT I AS FAR AS THE SPECIFICS OF THIS SO NOW I HAVE TO DEFER TO OTHERS IRAN IS A MAJOR KERR REFERRED TO WE HAVE A SERIES OF- SOMEWHAT CONNECTED- PRESERVES- IN NEWPORT BEACH AND- HUNTINGTON BEACH THAT YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE TO SEE IF YOU SET THE SUGGESTION IS THAT OKAY. I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION FOR MR STAFFERS- HAVE WE SEEN ANY KIND OF RELUCTANCE BY SURFERS TO GET BACK INTO THE WATER- BECAUSE OF THE OIL SPILLS WHAT SORT OF YOUR OBSERVATION. ON THE IMPACT ON THE SURFING COMMUNITY. YEAH YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CENTER MAN I MEAN THERE'S BEEN- WE'VE BEEN FLOODED WITH CALLS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE SPELL- NOT ONLY ABOUT YOU KNOW SAFETY OF SURFING BUT- ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS- I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE JUST THAT THE QUICK CAFFERTY THE UNIFIED COMMAND. TO GET THE WATER QUALITY TESTING UP AND RUNNING AND- YOU KNOW I THINK FOR GROUPS LIKE SURFRIDER THERE'S SORT OF A BALANCE BETWEEN. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS PROTECTED BUT WE ALSO WANT TO FIGHT FOR PUBLIC ACCESS AND SO. THIS WAS A CHALLENGING SITUATION I THINK COLLECTIVELY WHEN THE WATER QUALITY DATA WASN'T THERE DURING THAT FIRST WEEK AND SO. I YOU KNOW I THINK ONE THING THAT COULD MAYBE BE APPLIED FOR FUTURE SPELLS. IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THAT TESTING UP AND RUNNING MORE QUICKLY- YOU KNOW MEASURING SAMPLING WATER QUALITY FOR OIL CONTAMINATION. IS A WHOLE DIFFERENT THING THAN SAMPLING FOR BACTERIAL CONTAMINATION. STAR TYPICAL BEACH MONITORING PROGRAMS IN ORANGE COUNTY AND BEYOND. THEIR TESTING FOR ENTEROCOCCUS WHICH IS WHAT OUR OUR SURFRIDER VOLUNTEER WATER QUALITY LABS TESTS FOR. SOIL CONTAMINATION. T'S A DIFFERENT BEAST IT'S MORE COMPLICATED TO TEST FOR. AND FRANKLY THERE AREN'T A CLEAR SET OF GUIDELINES ARE THRESHOLDS FOR. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO IT. HAS CREATED SORT OF- A MORE SET A LESS KLAY STAND FOR WHAT'S ARE NOT- I THINKTHE SURFING COMMUNITY THOSE OF US WHO YOU KNOW WANT TO SEE THE DATA AND WHATNOT. WE HAVE SORT OF DEFERRED TO THAT THE COLLECTIVE EXPERTISE OF THE AGENCIES ARE AND THAT DOES LOOK THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL AGENCIES. TO SAY THAT THEY'RE DOING THE TESTING AND THEY'RE NOT FINDING DETECTABLE LEVELS OF OIL AND SO. I THINK FOR MOST MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY IN INCLUDING ME THAT'S BEEN ENOUGH TO SAY YOU WANT TO GO SURFING BUT- BUT THOSE QUESTIONS REMAIN AND- AND WE'RE TELLING PEOPLE JUST TO CAST. YOUR CHECK BEFORE YOU GO AND CHECKTHE WEBSITES. IN YOUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESOURCES. THANK YOU I GUESS MY LAST COMMENT IS IT MAYBE MORE COMMENT THAN A QUESTION BUT- TIM ISLEY ON GROSSMAN- I'VE PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE A LOT WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS WHILE THE BEACHES THAT I REPRESENT AND THEN GOING TO NEWPORT AND HUNTINGTON. ARE OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS VERY WEALTHY. AREAS THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE BEACHES AND COASTS FOR. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE COMING FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME THAT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- SO THE TICKET LOSS OF THESE BEACHES FOR ANYBODY'S IS A REAL ACCESS ISSUE BUT- I DON'T IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS ON THAT POINT IN THE IMPORTANCE OF. BEACHES AND BEACH ACCESS TO- EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT SENATOR I MEAN. ESPECIALLY THE PANDEMIC WE SAW HOW ACCESS TO NATURE. IT IS. SO IMPORTANT AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE A PRIVILEGE IS A NECESSITY. AND THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW. THE BEACHES WERE CLOSED FOR TWO WEEKS THAT. THAT IS A BIG DEAL FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN REALLY. CRAMPED YOU KNOW QUARTERS AND THAT'S THE ONLY RECREATION THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO SO IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR MANY MANY. PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO THAT'S- SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO PREVENT IN THE FUTURE ALL THESE TYPE OF MAN AND HE- MADE DISASTERS- AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO NEED TO AND- OIL DRILLING BOTH A MAN AND OFF SHORE- DETAILS OF. OUR COMMUNITIES A LOOK AT. A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECTED BY THE SUB OF EXTRACTIVE ECONOMIES SO- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REMARKS. THANK YOU- OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS BEFORE WE WRAP THIS PANEL ON SAND THERE NO MISS VICE CHAIR ALL RIGHT- BUT I'LL GET ON THIS ONE A WRAP UP QUESTION FOR- FOR THE ENTIRE PANEL IF ANYONE HAS A COMMENT BUT JUST- WHETHER THERE ARE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN STATED THUS FAR ON CHANGES IN STATE LAW- THAT ARE NECESSARY TO ADDRESS- OFFSHORE OIL RISKS EITHER FROM. ARMS IN FEDERAL WATERS THAT THEN IMPACT- STATE WATERS AND STATE LANDS- OR FOR THOSE- IN STATE WATERS. HOW WE CAN TAKE A WRITTEN TESTIMONY AS WELL IN THE FUTURE BUT IF ANYONE HAD A COMMENT THERE WE'D WE'D APPRECIATE. YOUR INPUT HE WILL BE TAKING. I WAS IS IT IT IS OKAY FOR ME TO GO YES PLEASE OKAY SO- AS- I THINK THAT IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY AND I SPOKE WITH SENATOR MAN EARLIER TODAY ABOUT THIS- IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO BE NOTIFIED MORE QUICKLY THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE I'M AS WELL AS SOME SORT OF COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITY- TO HELP OTHER CITIES- WHEN THEY DO HAVE THESE OIL SPILL RESPONSES- ARE ALL STILL INCIDENTS- WE IN HUNTINGTON. OR BLESSED IN THAT WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST MARINE SAFETY DIVISION AND WE HAVE BOATS WE HAVE JET SKIS WE HAVE A VERY EXTENSIVE OPERATION. BUT I KNOW JUST TO THE NORTH OF US YOU KNOW BEACH DOES NOT. AND SO IF THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE CAN BUILD WHAT SENATOR MAN HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THIS MORNING REGIONAL RESPONSE TO IT BUT IF WE GET NOTIFIED MORE QUICKLY AND THEN. BE MORE PRO ACTIVE WHILE THE- COAST GUARD IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WERE BEGINNING TO GET THEIR- PROGRAMS IN PLACE SO THAT WE'RE RIGHT THERE MEDIA WE ARE READY TO TAKE ACTION- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE COULD DO SOMETHING LEGISLATIVELY TO PROMOTE. THAT AND TO ENCOURAGE THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT MAYOR KERR- OTHERS. I KNOW INITIALLY HEARD FROM MR UEKI AND STUFF FOR ABOUT- SOME LONG TERM CLOSURE QUESTIONS- REMEDIATION- I DIDN'T KNOW IF ANYONE HAD A COMMENT ABOUTTHE ENERGY A PROCESS TO THAT'S SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE IS INTERESTED IN IN TERMS OF THE TIMING OF THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT WE KNOW WITH REFUGIO TOOK ABOUT FIVE YEARS TO GET FUNDS MOVING AND THAT. OTHER PROCESS HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY EXPEDITIOUS AND IT'S SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY AS CHAIR FLETCHER POINTED OUT- THE YOU KNOW EXACT MATH OF HOW BAD THE IMPACT'S BEEN- SO. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE TODAY BUT IT WILL BE LOOKING INTO THAT WHAT YOU DO YOU HAVE A QUICK COMMENT JUST JUST SUPER QUICK CENTER I MEAN I THINK I THINK YOU NEED IN YOUR. COMPUTER SUPPORT REGIONAL- DISASTER RESPONSE ALWAYS APPRECIATED YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS WE ACTIVATED SO EARLY WAS GOT A LOT OF VERY SMALL JURISDICTIONS WERE BEING IMPACTED BY THIS MAY BE JUST A DOCTOR ASK YOUR PROFESSOR. TO COORDINATE WITH THEM AGAINST YOU SO WE JUST ACTIVATED IT COUNTY WIDE. SECOND I'LL JUST NOTICE GENERALLY ON ONGOING WATER TESTING TO STAY AS A LOCAL AGENCY. AND COUNTY WERE GENERALLY GOING BACK TO YOUR GUESTS AND WE GENERALLY ARE NOT TESTING FOR. SOME OF THESE OTHER PETROLEUM BASED THINGS AND SO THERE'S YOU KNOW POTENTIAL EXPANSION AROUND. YOU DON'T WHAT COUNTIES ROUTINELY DEALS RUNNING WATER QUALITY IT COULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING. THAT MAY BE WORTH CONSIDERING YOU KNOW WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL. CAPABILITY OF TESTING FOR PETROLEUM BASED THINGS WE HAD TO BRING IN OTHER FOLKS TO WHAT TO DO THAT. SO THERE COULD BE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT THERE JUST BE INHERENT IN YOUR. PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES DOWN THE COST. THERE HAVE THANK YOU. TURN ME YES THERE'S A WIKI I CAN BE VERY IN THE COURSE HAPPY TO SUBMIT WRITTEN TESTIMONY AS WELL BUT- I AM SURE. THAT A REVIEW OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS IS GOING TO TURN OUT MANY MANY OPPORTUNITIES. TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE- ITEMS AND PARTS OF THE INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE OUT OF DATE. BOTH IN THEMSELVES COMPARED TO THEIR EXPECTED LIFE SPAN AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONAL PLANS UNDER WHICH THEY WERE ORIGINALLY- BIRD BURCHILL CONSTRUCTED. AND THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO FIVE SPECIFIC PIECES THAT ARE KNOWN TO BE EXISTING HAZARDS THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT THE FLIP SIDE OF THAT WHICH I'M SURE YOU ARE VERY WELL AWARE IS THAT. ANY INCREASED ANY ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY THESE COMPANIES IT'S GOING TO BE. UP IT'S GOING TO GO ALONG WITH AN EXPECTATION OF EVIL TO- CONTINUE OPERATING IN ORDER TO RECOUP THOSE INVESTMENTS AND I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE POINT THE POINT AT WHICH CALIFORNIA IS NOW ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IT'S LANDING. IN YOUR LAP WHICH IS HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THIS- BALANCE RIGHT NOW OF THE EIGHTY- COLLAPSING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S POSING A DANGER TO US NOW AND THE FINANCIAL DEMANDS OF THE INDUSTRY. SO IT'S A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD BUT- WHAT PART OF THE PART OF THE- A BIG PROBLEM THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DEAL WITH IT I GOT. THANKS FOR THE AND I THINK WITH MORE IN THAT ISSUE ON THE NEXT PANEL ACTUALLY SO IT'S GOOD G. U. T. THOSE ISSUES UP ON TALK TO STATE LANDS AND COASTAL COMMISSION HERE- ANY OTHER FINAL COMMENTS BEFORE WE WRAP UP THIS PANEL. GROSSMAN SURE START OUT AT THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND I WOULD JUST NOTE BRIEFLY- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT TEAMS ARE AT THIS HEARING TODAY HAS BEEN LESSONS LEARNED FROM REFUGIO AND OTHER PAST OIL SPILLS AND WE'VE REALLY FROM STARFIGHTERS PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW THE AGENCY RESPONSE HAS BEEN- SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM FROM APPLYING THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AND AS YOU KNOW THERE WAS ALSO A LEGISLATION PASSED AT THE STATE LEVEL FOLLOWING THAT TO IMPROVE- YOU KNOW SORT OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL OVERSIGHT BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE INVESTIGATION AND LESSONS LEARNED SO. I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT I THINK WE'RE STILL EARLY IN THE PROCESS OF REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHY THINGS HAPPENED AND YOU KNOW HOW THIS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED AND SO- YOU KNOW I THINK IT WILL BE IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION OFFLINE AND SURFRIDER WILL BE OFFERING- YOU KNOW OUR IDEA CERTAINLY IN THE UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S THERE ANY OTHER FURTHER COMMENTS WE JUST WANT TO SAY REAL QUICK YES PLEASE THINK THIS IS THIS IS PRONE TO HAPPEN AGAIN UNLESS WE REALLY. PUT A PATH TO THE COMMISSION ON THE ARTS AFTER WELLS AND- SO IT WILL BE. GREAT TO SEE A BILL TO PUT A PASS ON TO THE COMMISSION DOES WELLS. OUT BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE ALL THE SAFEGUARDS IN AND TRY TO MITIGATE ALL WE WANT BUT- I HAVE A SAYING THAT THE ONLY PIPELINE THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT THE ONE THAT HE'S NEVER BUILT. AND WE SEE HOW THESE INFRASTRUCTURE IS FAILING US AND- A LOT OF THESE WELLS ARE NOW FORTY FIFTY YEARS OLD AND- LIKE MY OTHER COLLEAGUE WAS SAYING IF THERE'S AN EXPECTATION OF RETROFITTING THESE. GUIDELINES THERE WILL BE AN EXPECTATION OF HAVING PROFIT FROM THEM. SO HOW DO WE MEET THE EXPECTATION OF PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND PROTECTING. THE ENVIRONMENT AND PROTECTING- IN DELETING ON CLIMATE SO I THINK IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO. PUT FORTH SOME LEADERSHIP IN ENSURING THAT WE'RE GOING TO. BE PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK THAT THAT VERY NICELY WRAPS UP- A CRITICAL TAKEAWAY FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER GOING FOR ITS APPRECIATE THAT. THAT TESTIMONY- I WITH THAT WILL WRAP UP OUR SECOND PANEL AND MOVED TO OUR FINAL PANEL- JUST TWO PARTICIPANTS- DOCTOR HUCKLE BRIDGE. A DEPUTY DIRECTOR IN TRIBAL LIAISON TO THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION AND MISS JENNIFER THE TRACY AT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION- MRS LUCE C. I THINK WE HAVE YOU DOWN HERE FIRST IF YOU DON'T MIND KICKING OFF. FIRST I'M HAPPY TO GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JENNIFER LOPEZ IN THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DISCUSSION ON THE FUTURE OF OFFSHORE OIL. IN THE SHORT TIME I HAVE A HOPE TO SUMMARIZE THE POLICY AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION AND PIPELINE LEASE MANAGEMENT IDENTIFIED EXISTING LEASES THE COMMISSION MANAGES. AND DISCUSS OUR OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITY. THESE OFFSHORE FACILITIES. THE STATE'S OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING HISTORY IS COMPLEX AND NUANCED. AND TO STATE THE OBVIOUS THE ENERGY POLICIES FROM THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND PRINCIPLES AND OUR POLICY PRIORITIES OF TODAY. HOWEVER THESE LEGACY I GUESS THE DECADES OLD ENERGY POLICIES ARE WHAT CREATED THE LEGAL CONSTITUTIONAL AND CONTRACTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT DICTATES THE COMPLEXITY OF THE OIL AND GAS LEASE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. TO THIS DAY I WILL MISS NECESSARILY INFORM YOUR DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION ON HOW TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED CLEAN ENERGY AND DRESSED TRANSITION OBJECTIVE. IS COMPLEX BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ADDRESS. FIRST AS BACKGROUND THE COMMISSION MANAGES- THE ESTATE SOVEREIGN PUBLIC TRUST LANDS WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY RIVERS AND LOSE FORTY LAKES AND LANDS ALONG THE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED MILES OF COASTLINE. AND UNDERLINE THE PACIFIC OCEAN OUT THREE MILES TO THE STATE FEDERAL BOUNDARY. TOGETHER THIS A COMPASS IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILLION ACRES. THE COMMISSION ALSO EXERCISES OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY OVER THE STATE'S PUBLIC LANDS GRANTED IN TRUST BY THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THIS INCLUDES THE OFFICE FOR A LONG BEACH OIL PRODUCTION OPERATIONS OPERATED AND MANAGED BY THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. WHILE THE COMMISSION HAS SOME REGULATORY FUNCTIONS IT IS PRINCIPALLY A LAND AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGENCY NOT A REGULATORY AGENCY. AND AS SUCH. WE WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SISTER REGULAR. A LIKE COASTAL. CAL J. SESSION WHILE BY. OSCAR FAT THE FIRE MARSHAL AND OTHERS TO LEVERAGE OUR AUTHORITIES AND JURISDICTION TO ADVANCE STATE POLICY OBJECTIVES. IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE LEGISLATURE CREATED THE FIRST THAILAND'S OIL AND GAS LEASING PROGRAM. THE EXISTING OFFSHORE LEASES THE COMMISSION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING TODAY OR ISSUED OVER A THIRTY YEAR PERIOD BETWEEN NINETEEN THIRTY EIGHT. AND NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT. IMPORTANTLY I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A SPECIFIC ACT IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE THE CUNNINGHAM SHALL ACT WHICH SERVES AS A FOUNDATIONAL LAW FOR THE EXISTING LEGACY OIL AND GAS LEASES THE COMMISSION CURRENTLY MANAGES. IMPORTANTLY THIS ACT REQUIRED THE COMMISSION TO ISSUE OIL AND GAS LEASES FOR A TERM NOT BASED ON YEARS BUT FOR SO LONG AS OIL AND GAS IS PRODUCED IN PAYING QUANTITIES. ESSENTIALLY THIS MEANS THAT UNLESS HE CAN PRODUCE OIL AND GAS PURSUANT TO THEIR STATE LEASE AND DEFINITELY. AS LONG AS IT IS ECONOMIC FOR THEM TO DO SO. THE SPECIFIC TERM IS INCLUDED IN ALL THE REMAINING ACTIVELY- REMAINING ELEVEN ACTIVELY PRODUCING OFFSHORE LEASES THE COMMISSION MANAGES. THESE LEASES WERE ENTERED INTO OVER FOUR FIFTY YEARS AGO AND PRIOR TO THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT. THROUGH THE COASTAL SANCTUARY ACT THE LEGISLATURE. CALIFORNIA'S COAST OFF LIMITS TO NEW OIL AND GAS LEASES. HAVE YOU PREVIOUSLY HEARD THE LIBERTINES SEASTRAND OIL SPILL PREVENTION AND RESPONSE ACT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE THIS ACT GAVE THE COMMISSION ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO PREVENT OIL SPILLS IN THE STATE'S OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS THROUGH MONTHLY AND ANNUAL INSPECTIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE SAFETY AUDITS CONDUCTED ON ALL OFFSHORE PLATFORMS AND ISLANDS EVERY FIVE YEARS. THE COMMISSION ALSO IMPLEMENTS A ROBUST PIPELINE SAFETY PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE FEDERAL PIPELINE AGENCY MS THAT. MORE RECENTLY THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF LAWS PASSED AT BOTH PROHIBIT THE COMMISSION FROM ISSUING NEW EXTREMELY SAYS FOR NEW INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE PIPELINES THAT WOULD FACILITATE NEW OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT IN FEDERAL WATERS AND ON FEDERALLY PROTECTED LAND IN CALIFORNIA. IMPORTANTLY THERE WILL ALSO BE IN A NUMBER OF LIVES THAT HAVE ADDED TOOLS TO THE COMMISSION'S TOOLBOX AND CAL JAM'S TOOLBOX TO BETTER MANAGE AND REGULATE EXISTING STATE OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS AND PROTECT THE STATE FROM LIABILITY. THE COMMISSION MANAGES APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN ACTIVELY PRODUCING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN- TO HELP PROVIDE SOME. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT TO WHERE THESE ARE LOCATED SO. HOLD TIGHT. I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS NOW. SO AS I MENTIONED THE COMMISSION MANAGES APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN ACTIVELY PRODUCING OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES MOST OF THESE LEASES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THREE PLATFORMS OFTEN ORANGE COUNTY THE COMMISSION MANAGES EIGHT OFFSHORE PIPE FINALLY SAYS CONNECTING FEDERAL PLATFORMS TO ONSHORE PROCESSING FACILITIES BOTH IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL AN OFFSHORE ORANGE COUNTY. SO THE MAP WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW THIS IS THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL THE COMMISSION HAS TO ACTIVELY PRODUCING LEASES REFERRED TO AS THE WESTMONT ALTHOUGH LEASES THESE ARE ON THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND OF YOUR SCREEN. THEY ARE WELLS THAT ARE DRILLED FROM ONSHORE DIRECTIONALLY OUT THE OFFSHORE RESERVOIR. THERE ARE SIX ACTIVE HI FINALLY SAYS CONNECTING BETTER ALL PLATFORMS TO ONSHORE PROCESSING FACILITIES. AND CURRENTLY ON THE SITE AS WELL AS THE LOCATION OF THE COMMISSIONS TWO ACTIVE DECOMMISSIONING PROJECTS- PLATFORM HOLLY AND RINCON ISLAND. PLATFORM HOLLY IS THE LAST PLATFORM IN STATE WATERS AND ISN'T AND HASN'T BEEN PRODUCING FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW AND THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IS ACTIVELY PLUGGING AND ABANDONING THOSE THIRTY WELLS WE HOPE TO BE COMPLETED WITH THAT OPERATION AND. TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. AND THEN MOVING ON TO. FOUR MINUTES ENTIRE. THE NEXT FLIGHT- INCLUDED. AND THAT AT LOS ANGELES AND ORANGE COUNTY AREA- THE COMMISSION MANAGES ONE LEASE OFF SHORE- LA OR ORANGE COUNTY CLOSE TO THE LA COUNTY BORDER THIS- AND- IS OPERATED BY CALIFORNIA RESOURCES COMPANY CORPORATION AND INVOLVES ISLAND CHAFEE. MOVING DOWN TO ORANGE COUNTY THE COMMISSION AND MANAGES AT ONE LEAST ASSOCIATED WITH PLATFORM ASTOR. THE COMMISSION ALSO MANAGES CHILE SAYS ASSOCIATE WITH PLATFORM ABBA I SHOULD BACKTRACK PLATFORM PASTOR AND OTHER- BOTH OPERATED BY D. CORE. AND FINELY- THE COMMISSION MANAGES FIVE LEASES ASSOCIATED WITH PLATFORM AND ME OPERATED BY CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION. IN ADDITION THE COMMISSION MANAGES TO ACTIVE PIPELINE LEASES CONNECTING FEDERAL PLATFORMS TO SHORE AND TWO PIPELINE LEASES CONNECTING ASTOR AN ENEMY TOP STORIES WHILE. FARM ALLEY- THE PLATFORM ALLEY PIPELINE AT ISSUE OF THAT RECENT OIL SPILL THE COMMISSION HAS A LEASE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PIPELINE IS HIGHLIGHTED AS STATELESS D. SIX THIRTY SIX. AND COVERS- A LITTLE OVER FOUR MILES OF THE PIPELINE- LUSH. ORANGE COUNTY BETWEEN THE FEDERAL STATE OFF FOR A BOUNDARY AND WHEN THAT PIPELINE CROSSES INTO LA COUNTY WHERE IT'S MANAGED BY THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. LET'S STOP SHARING MY SCREEN- AND MOVE ON. DEALT LARGEST- OPERATION IN STATE WATERS FOR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION INVOLVES THE WILMINGTON FIELD OFFICE FOR A LONG BEACH THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FOURTH LARGEST OIL FIELD IN NORTH AMERICA. AND THROUGH A SERIES OF STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE STATE RECEIVES A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE NET PROFITS GENERATED ASK BEFORE WELL ISLANDS AND THE WEST WILMINGTON OPERATIONS WHICH ARE LOCATED- UNDER THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. UNDER VARIOUS STATUTES AND AGREEMENTS THE CITY OF LONG BEACH IS CONSIDERED THE OPERATOR OF THOSE OPERATIONS AND CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION IS THE CITY'S CONTRACTOR. THE COMMISSION DOES NOT SERVE AS M. AS IN A ROLE AS LESSOR LIKE ANY OTHER LEASES. AND HAS ACTUALLY VERY LIMITED AUTHORITY OVER THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF THESE OPERATIONS. AS PART OF THESE OIL AND GAS LEASES. AN EXCUSE I'M GONNA GO BACK TO MY NOTES REAL QUICK. AS PART OF THESE OIL AND GAS LEASES IN THE PIPE FINALLY SAYS THE COMMISSION REQUIRES OPERATORS TO MAINTAIN BONDS INSURANCE AND OTHER LIABILITY PROTECTION INSTRUMENTS TO PROTECT THE STATE THIS IS IN ADDITION TO- TENNEY BONDS REQUIRED BY CAL JAM. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE STATE LEGISLATURE BEGINNING IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR PROHIBITED THE COMMISSION FROM ENTERING INTO ANY NEW OIL AND GAS. FOR THAT POLICY HAS SET THE FOUNDATION FOR WHERE THE COMMISSION FINDS ITSELF TODAY. AND TO COME INTO THE DECOMMISSIONING PHASE AND MANY OF THE STATE'S OFFSHORE FACILITIES AND THIS LEADS ME TO THE FINAL PART OF MY PRESENTATION. THE COMMISSION RECOGNIZES THAT THE EFFECTS AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS REQUIRE THE STATE TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE WAY IT PRODUCES AND CONSUMES ENERGY AND THERE IS A BRIDGE TO THE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART IN BUILDING THAT BRIDGE AS THE LAND OWNING AGENCY THAT OVERSEES OVER FOUR MILLION ACRES OF PUBLIC LANDS WE ARE WORKING HARD TO DIVERSE THE FIRE LEASING AND REVENUE GENERATING PORTFOLIO AND POSITION OURSELVES TO BE PARTNERS IN FACILITATING OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. THIS INCLUDES PURSUING PARALLEL TRACKS OF FACILITATING GEOTHERMAL SOLAR AND WIND DEVELOPMENT ON LANDS WE MANAGE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DESERT. AND WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO FACILITATE OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT IN FEDERAL WATERS WELL ACTIVELY WORKING WITH CAL JAM AND OUR OIL AND GAS LESSEES TO ABANDON IDLE WELLS AHEAD OF THE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. AND SURE THE STATE IS ADEQUATELY PROTECTED THROUGH BONDS SINKING FUNDS PROPERTY LANES AD OTHER MECHANISMS. ACTIVELY DECOMMISSIONING OFFSHORE FACILITIES REMEDIATING OFFSHORE ORPHAN LEGACY WELLS AND CONTINUING TO IMPLEMENT ROBUST AND COMPREHENSIVE SPILL PREVENTION AND INSPECTION PROGRAMS. IN FACT IN THE LAST SIX YEARS. HELLO THE TERM. OF TEN OFF OIL AND GAS LEASES RETURNING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND EIGHT THE COASTAL SANCTUARY. IN CONCLUSION THE COMMISSION UNDERSTANDS ITS PLACE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY AND ITS FUTURE OF FOSSIL FUEL SUPPLY INDEPENDENCY THE COMMISSION IS COMMITTED TO A JUST A RESPONSIBLE TRANSITION TO RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE WHILE RESPONSIBLY MANAGING THE STATE'S EXISTING OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW. AND ENSURING THE STATE IS PROTECTED FROM LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH IT KLEIN OF THESE OFFSHORE OPERATIONS. CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE RIGHT TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU BUT- DOCTOR HEALTH COVERAGE DID YOU WANT TO- SOME BRIEF TESTIMONY HERE AND THEN WE CAN HAVE SOME MEMBER QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. YES THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SURE STERN- AND DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS KIM HOW BRIDGE AND I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR ENERGY OCEAN RESOURCES AND FEDERAL CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE COMMISSION. TODAY I'LL PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE COMMISSION'S ROLE AND JURISDICTION OVER OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES IN STATE AND FEDERAL WATERS. IN OUR MOMENT WILL SPILL RELATED ACTIVITIES. THE COASTAL COMMISSION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE A CERTIFIED LOCAL COASTAL PROGRAM. DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING OIL AND GAS WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY WITH THE POLICIES OF THE COASTAL ACT. THE GIRLS ON CAMPUS IS THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA SHORELINE EXCEPT FOR SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND. INCLUDE STATE WATERS OUT TO THREE MILES OFFSHORE. IN ADDITION TO OUR DIRECT COMPANY ROLE INTO THE COASTAL ACT WE ARE ONE OF THE STATE AGENCIES CHARGED WITH IMPLEMENTING THE FEDERAL COASTAL ZONE MANAGEMENT ACT. AT THIS POINT LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN A FEW POWER POINT SLIDES. BEAR WITH ME. OKAY HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THE SCIENCE- SO CONGRESS IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO THE CCMA PROVIDES FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE NATION'S COASTAL RESOURCES THROUGH FEDERAL AND STATE PARTNERSHIP. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION OR NOAA CERTIFIED CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. CERTAINLY THE CERTIFICATION GRANTED REVIEW OF THE COMMISSION A FEDERAL PROJECTS AND FEDERALLY PERMITTED PROJECTS OUTSIDE OF THE COASTAL ZONE INCLUDING ACTIVITIES PROPOSED IN FEDERAL WATERS. THESE REVIEWS CALLED FEDERAL CONSISTENCY REVIEWS ARE TRIGGERED WHEN A PROJECT OR ACTIVITY COULD HAVE SPILLOVER EFFECTS ON CULTURAL RESOURCES WITHIN THE COASTAL ZONE AND ASSESS WHETHER THE ACTIVITY IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE CERTIFIED COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SH THE CHAPTER THREE POLICIES OF THE COASTAL ACT SERVICE THE ENFORCEABLE POLICIES. OF CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. SO ARE THESE POLICIES. TRYING. TO CHANGE MY SLANG HERE. HOLD ON ONE SEC. SO THE COST INCLUDES COASTAL RESOURCE PROTECTION POLICIES RELATED TO MARINE RESOURCES AND WATER QUALITY COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL FISHING ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES SCENIC AND VISUAL RESOURCES PUBLIC ACCESS AND RECREATION. GIVE ME- AND COASTAL HAZARDS AMONG OTHERS IN ADDITION THE COASTAL ACT INCLUDES POLICIES SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT THAT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION OF NEW OR EXPANDED FACILITIES AND REQUIRE PIPELINE TRANSPORTS OIL FROM OFFSHORE PLATFORMS TO ITS REFINERY DESTINATIONS. BECAUSE ALL INCLUDE POLICY THAT ALLOWS FOR COASTAL COMMISSION APPROVAL OF NEW OR EXPANDED BECAUSE INDEPENDENT INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES LIKE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PLATFORMS AND ASSOCIATED PIPELINES. EVEN IF THOSE FACILITIES ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OTHER POLICIES AND COSTS LACKS IS ALRIGHT POLICY WAS INCLUDED IN THE COASTAL ACT WHEN OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS. IN COASTAL POWER PLANTS THAT RELY ON SEA WATER FOR COOLING PLAYED A BIG ROLE IN THE STATE'S ENERGY PORTFOLIO AND THIS POLICY WAS DEEMED NECESSARY COMPROMISE. GIGI PASSAGE OF THE COASTAL ACT. SEVERAL THANKS BRIAN. EXECUTIVE OFFICER BECAUSE HE PROVIDED A THOROUGH OVERVIEW OF EXISTING OIL AND GAS FACILITIES OFFSHORE CALIFORNIA SO I WON'T REPEAT THAT HERE- I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HOWEVER MISSIONS HISTORY AND ROLE OR LACK THERE OF IN REVIEWING AND AUTHORIZING USE EXISTING FACILITIES ALL THE OFFSHORE FORMS WERE PROPOSED DURING THE NINETEEN SIXTIES SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES AS A RESULT OVER HALF OF THE EXISTING FACILITIES WERE APPROVED EITHER BEFORE THE COASTAL ACT WAS PASSED OUT OR BEFORE CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM CERTIFIED BY NOAH. AND THUS WERE NOT REVIEWED. OR APPROVED BY THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THE CALLS ACT REVIEWS THAT ARE BECAUSE LIKE REVIEWS AND APPROVALS THAT DID OCCUR TOOK PLACE DURING THE EARLY DAYS OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND WE'RE NOT AS ROBUST AS WE AS WOULD BE UNDERTAKEN TODAY. THIS MEANS IS THAT THERE ARE SOCIALLY NO CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL AND THOSE INITIAL COMMENTS FOR CONSISTENCY TO. ASIANS PROVIDE FOR ONGOING OVERSIGHT MISSION. FOR OIL AND GAS FACILITIES ON FEDERAL WATERS WE WILL HAVE A FEDERAL CONSISTENCY ROLE IF AN OPERATOR PROPOSES SIGNIFICANT REPAIRS NEW FACILITIES OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PRODUCTION THAT COULD IN FACT. BECAUSE THE RESOURCES AND REQUIRES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE OF MISSION HAS REVIEWED PIPELINE REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS OUR CABLE REPLACEMENTS AND NEWLY PROPOSED PLATFORM JUST CHARGES. ZEROING IN ON PLATFORM ELLIE THIS PLATFORM WAS PROPOSED PRIOR TO CERTIFICATION OF CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND THIS CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE PLATFORM AND A PORTION OF PIPELINE IN FEDERAL WATERS WAS NOT REVIEWED BY THE COMMISSION. AND THE COMMISSION DID HOWEVER PROVIDE THE PORTION OF THE PIPELINE IN STATE WATERS. FINALLY I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE. A BRIEF RUNDOWN OF THE COMMISSION STAFF INVOLVEMENT IMPOSED OIL SPILL ACTIVITIES. SO MY ROLE IS MOSTLY GOING TO SUPPORT ONGOING CLEANUP. ACTIVITIES DIRECTED BY UNIFIED MAN'S WE PARTICIPATED IN MULTI AGENCY CALLS IMPREGNATED WITH UNIFIED COMMAND ON ISSUING EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATIONS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. FOR CONSTRUCTION SAND BERMS TO PROTECT SENSITIVE HABITATS. AS AVERAGE SHIFT TOWARDS ADDRESSING A BROKEN PIPELINE IN FEDERAL WATERS. THE COMMISSION MAY HAVE A LITTLE CONSISTENCY ROLE UNDER CDM ANCHOR ANY PIPELINE REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT WORK THAT COULD HAVE AN EFFECT ON COASTAL RESOURCES. AND LASTLY IS PROVIDED FOR US AND WE BUILT TWENTY SIXTY FOUR AND I SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER. THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGE ASSESSMENT ORDER PROCESS. AND TO THAT END WE ARE WORKING WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES TO CONTRIBUTE THE COMMISSION'S EXPERTISE IN COASTAL HABITATS AND SPECIES. PUBLIC ACCESS AND RECREATION IN. SUPPORT ABOUT ONGOING OR AS FOR. SO WILL THAT I WILL CONCLUDE BUT OF COURSE I AVAILABLE FOR ANY. YOU MAY HAVE- THANK YOU DOCTOR HAVE DOCTOR HAVE A BRIDGE- MEMBERS COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR- FOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CASEY YOUR DOCTOR HALF BRIDGE- RIGHT I'LL JUST START OFF BRIEFLY- I'M HOPING-ONE OR BOTH OF YOU CAN COMMENT ON THIS. THE SORT OF WHAT SEEMS TO BE A MISMATCH BETWEEN THE LIABILITIES THE RISKS AND THE- THE CAPITALIZATION- OR FUNDING SET ASIDE CURRENTLY TO DEAL NOT JUST WITH- POLLUTION EVENTS LIKE THE ONES WE'VE SEEN BUT- ALSO DECOMMISSIONING COSTS- I'M I'M CURIOUS- IF PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO- THE PLATFORMING QUESTION- WE'VE SEEN REPORTS THAT- PROXIMITY. TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR DECOMMISSIONING COSTS ON ON THOSE PARTICULAR OPERATIONS BUT- WE KNOW THAT AMPLIFIES BEEN RECENTLY RE CAPITALIZE AT A BANKRUPTCY- AS WELL AS BEING CITED FOR NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS BY FEDERAL REGULATORS IN THE MEANTIME. WHAT HAPPENS IF AMPLIFY- DECIDES TO DECLARE BANKRUPTCY. I'M HAPPY TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT- THAT- FOR PLATFORMS- ARE THE THREE THAT AMPLIFY OPERATES IN FEDERAL WATERS- OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH AND BESSIE- AND BONE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE. BONDS AND OTHER- LIABILITY PROTECTION MECHANISMS IN PLACE AS PART OF THE FEDERAL LEASING LEASE AND LEASING PROCESS. AT LEAST FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION AND- WE DO NOT HAVE ANY JURISDICTION OUTSIDE OF THE STATE'S THREE MILE- BOUNDARY HOWEVER OBVIOUSLY THAT PIPELINE DOES CROSS INTO STATE WATERS AND AS PART OF OUR LEAST- WITH- SAN PEDRO BAY PIPELINE COMPANY A SUBSIDIARY OF AMPLIFY. WE RECENTLY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO INCREASED OUR BOND AMOUNT- POWER AT THAT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO MANAGE AND HOLD ON TO EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS PLUS THERE IS A PARENTAL GUARANTEE- FROM AMPLIFY- IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE IS A FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR SINKING FUND- TO COVER PIPELINE AND- DECOMMISSIONING IN THE ENTIRETY OF STATE WATER SO THAT WOULD COVER NOT ONLY AND THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION LEASE BUT THAT PORTION OF THE PIPELINE- IT. LONG BEACH MANA. NOW OBVIOUSLY A PARENTAL GUARANTEE- ONLY GOES SO FAR WHEN THAT- PARENT COMPANY DROPS INTO BANKRUPTCY WE DO HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE RECENTLY UNFORTUNATELY WITH OIL AND GAS COMPANY'S DROPPING INTO BANKRUPTCY AND- AND ABANDONING THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO RESTORE THE LEASED PREMISES- I HAD BECAUSE- IT SUITS OUR ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS NEEDS- WE ARE. ACTIVELY PURSUING- AT DEAD. TRUSTEES ASSOCIATED WITH- PLATFORM HOLLY AND RINCON ISLAND- AS WELL AS OTHER OPERATORS ASSOCIATED WITH- SOME FEDERAL LEASES WHERE WE RECENTLY TERMINATED THE PIPELINE IN STATE WATERS AND- IT'S IT IS- VERY VERY CHALLENGING THAT FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS- DO NOT OPERATE IN FAVOR OF CREDITORS- OR- NON SECURED CREDITORS INCLUDING THE STATE. AND SO AS PART OF OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS- WE HAVE APPROACHED OUR OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LESS FEES TO INCREASE THAT LIABILITY PROTECTION NOT JUST WITH BONDS- WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT COVER. ALL THE DECOMMISSIONING- AND PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT COSTS BUT ALSO THROUGH OTHER CREATIVE MEASURES LIKE SECURING- PRIORITY LANES ON- PRIVATE LAND- SEEKING FUNDS WHERE WE CAN ACCESS ACTUAL CASH TO COVER- OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER MECHANISMS- SO WE ARE DEFINITELY LEARNING FROM OUR EXPERIENCE OVER THE LAST. FIVE YEARS AND TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF LIABILITY PROTECTION MEASURES TO PROTECT THE STATE AND ALL CALIFORNIANS. AND JUST TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT WE KNOW SHELL WAS THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPER FOR THIS BETA UNIT IN THE OIL FIELD- PRECEDING CCMA BUT- IT SHALL ULTIMATELY. LIABLE FOR THOSE DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IN THE EVENT THAT AN AMPLIFIER OR OR SUBSIDIARY- YOU KNOW IT WOULD IT WOULD DECLARE BANKRUPTCY IS THAT IS THERE DOES IT DOES THEIR RECOURSE TO THE ORIGINAL OPERATOR OR- OR NOT. AND THAT IS A QUESTION THAT IS- CAN BE MORE COMPLETELY ANSWERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- I DO KNOW THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE CERTAIN LAWS ON THE BOOK AND IT'S REFLECTED IN CERTAINLY SAYS WHERE THEY CAN GO BACK TO PRIOR PRIOR OPERATORS. TO COVER DECOMMISSIONING COSTS BUT I'M NOT SURE HOW FAR BACK THEY CAN- THAT GRAB THE PRIOR OPERATOR SO I CAN'T ANSWER THAT DIRECTLY FOR THIS UNIT BECAUSE IT IS A FEDERAL WATERS AND GOVERNED BY FEDERAL LAW ONLY SAYS- BUT WE DO HAVE SIMILAR- SITUATIONS AND- FIRST. APPSWARM SO FOR EXAMPLE- WITH PLATFORM AND- D. CORE IS THE CURRENT OPERATOR BUT AS PART OF THEIR ACQUISITION OF THOSE LEASES. FREEPORT MAC MORAN WHO WAS THE PRIOR ART OPERATOR IS STILL ON THE HOOK FOR DECOMMISSIONING COSTS. SO EVERY- SITUATION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON THE BUSINESS DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK BETWEEN THE VARIOUS OPERATORS AND ASSIGNING A LEASEHOLD INTEREST- BUT- THAT'S THE SITUATION OUT PLATFORM ASTOR SIMILARLY AND THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL WITH THAT ARM HOLLY- WHEN DENICO ACQUIRED THE LEASEHOLD- INTEREST FROM EXXON MOBIL. AND EXXON AS A CONDITION OF THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL OF ASSIGNMENT EXXON MOBIL IS STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR BOTH. PLUGGING AND ABANDONING AND DECOMMISSIONING PLUGIN BANNING THE WELLS AND DECOMMISSIONING THE PLATFORM SO WHILE THE STATE HAS AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR- THAT DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE AND ESSENTIALLY- MANNING THEPLATFORM. EXXON MOBIL IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR AND IMPLEMENTING THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONMENT- PROGRAM AND ULTIMATELY DECOMMISSIONING THAT PLATFORM. SO IT'S REALLY A CASE BY CASE BASIS DEPENDING ON THE HISTORY OF THE LEASE ASSIGNMENTS AND THE PRIOR OPERATORS AND THE BUSINESS DEALS ASSOCIATED ABOUT. THANKS FOR THE VERY LAST QUESTION IN THIS ON THIS LINE OF- INQUIRY- YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE SINKING FUND THAT HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE UNDER IT I RECENTLY GO SHE ATION OF BELIEVES IN TWENTY NINETEEN- THAT. THAT SET ASIDE WAS WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR- FOR THE PARTICULAR FIELD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY IN THE PIPELINE SPECIFICALLY THAT'S IN STATE WATERS. DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE DECOMMISSIONING PORTION OF. THAT FACILITY THE PIPELINE IS FROM US TO WE HAVE A TO HAVE A COST ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT FOR WHAT WHAT DECOMMISSIONING WOULD COST AND THAT'S. IN SAN PEDRO BAY AREA. YEAH THAT'S SO IN TERMS OF THAT. PIPELINE AS OF OUR- AND- THE COMMISSION INCREASING THE BOND REQUIREMENT- AT AS WELL AS- THAT SINKING FUND. WE ESTIMATED FOR THE STATE'S PORTION SUGGESTS THAT FOUR POINT FOUR MILE PORTION OF THE PIPELINE THAT THE DECOMMISSIONING COSTS WOULD BE- ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS SO BETWEEN- THAT. EIGHT POINT NINE MILLION DOLLAR BOND AND THEN ARE PROPORTIONAL- ALLOCATION OF THAT SINKING FUND- WE CURRENTLY HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE DECOMMISSIONING OF THE PORTION OF PIPELINE UNDER LEASE FROM THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION- THAT QUESTION ABOUT THE OTHER SECTION OF THE PIPELINE THAT'S MANAGEDBY THE CITY OF LONG BEACH. THEY DO HAVE ACCESS THE REMAINING PORTION OF THAT SINKING FUND- AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME WHAT OTHER LIABILITY PROTECTIONS THEY MAY HAVE IN THE EVENT OF DECOMMISSIONING. OKAY THANKS- THE MEMBERS FOR THE QUESTIONS IF YES MR MAJORITY LEADER CENTERS FOR WELCOME. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN APOLOGISES LATER AIRPLANE AIRPLANE AIRPLANES- YEAH I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE CHAIRMAN'S QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WITH THE WITH SOME YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD THE CHALLENGE WITH PLATFORM HOLLY. LIKE WE'VE NOW INTRODUCED IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS I USED TO BUILD SOME YEARS AGO ON PLATFORM HOLLY. TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE BOND BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS OUTSIZED EXPOSURE. AND NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE BONDS I KNOW THAT SENATOR JACKSON SAID AND I THINK IT WAS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE MOMENT THE TIME DID A SIMILAR THING. AND WITH JUST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PLATFORM HOLLY FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE ARCHITECTURE OF WHAT WE DO TO GET RID OF OFFSHORE OIL. BUT BUT I REMEMBER READING THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF EXPOSURE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IT YOUR- DID I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECT THAT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THAT MONEY WE'VE BEEN PAYING FOR IT. AND THERE'S BEEN A REQUEST IN THE BUDGET TO HELP SUPPLEMENT THESE COSTS. THESE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BE REIMBURSED THROUGH A GUARANTEE BY EXXON MOBIL WITH RESPECT TO THAT PROJECT. I AM I WILL CLARIFY- SO. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS- IN TERMS. DOING THE TALKING AND ABANDONMENT AND DECOMMISSIONING FOR PLATFORM HOLLY. DENICO DROPPED INTO BANKRUPTCY GIVING THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION A COUPLE OF DAYS NOTICE AND SO WE HAD TO MOBILIZE QUICKLY TO ESSENTIALLY STAFF THE PLATFORM BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THE RISKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH LEADING EDGE AND STAFF. THAT REQUEST THAT WE HAVE MADE AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS REALLY FOCUSES IN ON COVERING THE COST OF- STAFFING THE PLATFORM AND STAFFING ON YOUR- PROCESSING FACILITY. WHICH PROCESSES THAT THAT REALLY RISKY AND DEADLY HYDROGEN SULFIDE GAS- THAT IT ALSO PRODUCED FROM PLATFORM HOLLY HOW MUCH MONEY IS THAT- FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS I THOUGHT I SAW SOMETHING IN THE BUDGET FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS REALLY TO THAT PROJECT IN MY WRONG. I MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SO- THAT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTING AN APPROPRIATIONS NOT JUST TO- ADDRESS PLATFORM HOLLY BUT ALSO TO PLUG AND ABANDON THE SEVENTY FIVE WELLS ASSOCIATED WITH RINCON ISLAND AND DECOMMISSIONING THOSE FACILITIES WHICH IS AWESOME AND DERRICK COUNTY. AND A LOT OF TIMES THOSE APPROPRIATIONS HAD- HAPPENED- IN A BUNDLE SO THAT THAT WOULDN'T GET YOU ABOVE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THOSE FUNDS REIMBURSABLE FOR THOSE OPERATIONS AND THE GAS IS THAT BY VIRTUE OF THE GUARANTEE THAT YOU REFERRED TO IN RESPECT EXXON MOBIL. NO I'M GONNA GET TO THAT- SO. WE DO NOT HAVE AND- RT THAT IS- AT VALIDLY AND STILL LIVE ASSOCIATED WITH FROM KHAN ISLAND THAT- BAT LEFTY HAS COMPLETELY LIQUIDATED. AND THERE ARE NO- OPPORTUNITIES REALLY TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS. WITH PLATFORM HOLLY EXXON MOBIL THROUGH THE ASSIGNMENT TO- PROCESS DID RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AN OBLIGATION TO FUND THE PUB IN AN ABANDONMENT OF THE THIRTY EIGHT WELLS. AS WELL AS FUND THE DECOMMISSIONING. AS PART OF- A SETTLEMENT WITH EXXON MOBIL THAT EXXONMOBIL HAS- AGREED TO COMPLETELY FIND THOSE OPERATIONS AND IMPLEMENT THAT. IN ADDITION- AT THIS STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR STAFFING THE PLATFORM AND CONDUCTING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ASSOCIATED- TO SUPPORT AGAIN AND ABANDONMENT- AND DECOMMISSIONING OPERATIONS AND SO- EXXON MOBIL I THINK THEIR LAST. ESTIMATE WHICH IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO PRIOR TO THAT AND DOMINIC- ESTIMATED PLUGIN AND- DECOMMISSIONING OF THE PLATFORM AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. THAT COST HAS ONLY INCREASED- BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE WELLS AND- BECAUSE OF THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A PANDEMIC IN TERMS OF- TRYING OUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS DURATION CONCERN FOR JUST BECAUSE- I'M TRYING TO TAKE IN WHEN I CHAIRED THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE. TRYING TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE VIEW. AS TO HOW WE CAN INTELLIGENTLY. ELIMINATE I THINK IT WAS A TWENTY THREE OFFSHORE WELLS AND WE'VE GOT THE FEDERAL ISSUES AND THE LIKE HOW DO WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN. HOW DO WE MAKE IT HAPPEN THE WAY THAT REMAIN THE MINUSES RICH TO TAXPAYERS. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE THESE ONE OFF DEALS THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A GUARANTEE OR NOT. IT YOU WHAT WHAT I EXPERIENCED BEFORE IN THIS COMMITTEE WAS THAT WE HAD SITUATIONS. WHERE THESE BIG COAST SOUL LAW OFF. THESE WELL TO GET THE LAST DRAW OF OIL TO A SMALL OP WHO THEN FILED. AND THEN THAT WE HAVE NO RECOURSE SO WHAT ARE WE TO SHOW UP AT THE AND THEN WE HAVE EMINENT DOMAIN ISSUES IF WE TRY TO JUST TAKE ON. THE QUESTION THAT WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH IS HOW DO WE- MINIMIZE RISKS TO TAXPAYERS MAXIMIZE THE SPEED WITH WHICH WE CAN GET THESE THINGS GONE RIGHT IT MAKES SOME SENSE. BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE GONNA TAKE EVERY NICKEL OUT OF THE OCEAN OF THE GLOBAL OIL THEY POSSIBLY CAN YOU CAN YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST WITH THE WAY THE BUSINESS WORLD WORKS. HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SPEAKER PEROT'S WHEN. YOU WERE A CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. CENTER LAYERED I BELIEVE HAD A HAD A THING ON THE ON THE- RIGS TO REEFS FROM SOMETHING THAT I SAW IN THE NORTH SEA WHEN I WAS OVERSEAS IN IN IN IN MY BUSINESS EXPERIENCE. AND I ALSO SAW IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THAT WAS WILDLY EFFECTIVE. AND AGAIN TRYING TO DELIVER WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHAT WAS SO GREAT ABOUT THESE IDEAS WAS. WE COULD TAKE THESE WELLS CHOPPED WHERE THERE WAS A X. ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. THAT WAS THE TEST IN THE BLOG THE JOHN PRESS PUT IN AND I FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE ON. WAS A SPEAKER PRESS. CHOPPING OFF A HUNDRED FEET SO SHIPS CAN GO OVER. IS LONG AS IT IS IN THE PHARMACY BENEFIT THAT YOU CAN HAVE A REFORM MODES BELOW THEN YOU HAVE THE- COMPANIES GIVE THE STATE AN ENDOWMENT THE LARGE WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ENDOWMENT THE QUESTION FOLLOWING UP ON THE GERMAN. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE LARGEST ENDOWMENT FOR OCEANS IN THE WORLD A DOLLAR OF TAXPAYER MONEY INCENTIVIZES THESE PEOPLE TO SHUT THEM DOWN WE HAVE NO RISK. IT'S A IT'S AN OCEANOGRAPHIC BENEFIT WE SEE IT HAPPEN ALL OVER THE WORLD. JENNIFER A BUNCH OF REASONS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THAT DONE. BUT AGAIN IT'S TRYING TO HAVE A RATIONAL APPROACH BECAUSE HERE WE ARE THAT ANOTHER PROBLEM EVERYBODY'S GOING CRAZY IT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER. AND WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK IN THE MORASS OF LIABILITY OF NEW BUDGET REQUESTS OF WHO YOU'RE GOING TO SUE IT'S A FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR LAWYERS NO DISRESPECT TO LAWYERS BUT- IT DOESN'T ACHIEVE THE DELIVERABLES IN THE DEFINITION OF SUCCESS IN MY JUDGMENT FOR ALL OF US LANCE COMMISSION COASTAL COMMISSION THE LEGISLATURE. IS SHUT HIM DOWN. GET AS MUCH EITHER NO COST TO TAXPAYERS. RISKS TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND IS MUCH MONEY INTO A FUND TO PROTECT THE OCEAN THAT NO TAXPAYERS COST AS POSSIBLE SO I THINK WE JUST PUT THIS BACK OUT THERE BECAUSE THIS COMMITTEE'S BEEN DELIBERATING THESE THINGS AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUE. THAT NO ONE WANTS TO DO WITH THE- COMPANIES BUT THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION IS. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CREATE A STRUCTURE THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY OTHERWISE WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE LEE. BE IN THIS SITUATION THERE WILL BE ANOTHER SPILL THERE WILL BE ANOTHER PROBLEM THERE WILL BE ANOTHER BANKRUPTCY. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A GOVERNMENT. TO GET IT DONE BECAUSE I WOULD SUSPECT. THAT IF WE DONE WHAT PRINCE HAD DONE WHAT I FOLLOWED UP ON PRINCE WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE. A LOT OF THESE THINGS WOULD BE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING DECOMMISSIONED TODAY AND WE HAVE A LOT LESS RISK AND WE DID WE'D BE A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO TRY TO GO ON SO LONG BUT- IT WILL WORK ON THIS ISSUE FOR SEVEN YEARS AND I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK. MAYBE NOW WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING WE CAN DRAW THE ATTENTION I LIKE MR CHAIRMAN. IT TO YOUR COMMITTEE INTO YOUR LEADERSHIP KIND OF CORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO JUST GET IT DONE. THANK YOU. PRETTY SURE THE COMMON IN THE HISTORY OF LEADERSHIP- THAT THIS ENTIRE COMMITTEE BENEFITS FROM. THE TWEEN YOU AND FORMER SECRETARY LAYERED HERE WE'VE GOT. GOOD KNOWLEDGE BUILT TO BUILD ON WE STILL HAVEN'T MADE PROGRESS TO YOUR POINT- DR HAWKING BRIDGER. IS THE NEW CASEY ANY QUICK FEEDBACK OR COMMENTS. TO THE MAJORITY LEADER'S. CHARGE. I CAN GO FIRST KATE OR DATE WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOGO OKAY I- I WANT TO- I THINK- CENTER HERZBERG FOR HIS COMMENTS I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THAT ADDING TO THE TOOLS TOOL CHEST OF- STATE AGENCIES- TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE FROM ALL DIFFERENT SIDES- IS THE BEST APPROACH BECAUSE WHAT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL MAY NOT WORK- FOR EVERY SINGLE STATE FORMER STATE LEASE OR OR EVEN IN THE FEDERAL WATERS I WILL SAY THAT- YOUR BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH- REQUIRES CAL JAM TO UPDATE ITS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFSHORE- OPERATIONS- IS SUCH A TOOL AND- WE ENJOYED WORKING WITH CAL JAM ON- SOME OF THE INITIAL RESEARCH THAT. WAS CONDUCTED AS PART OF THAT WE ALSO THINK THAT- AT EXPLORING THE END BRAINSTORMING ABOUT INCENTIVES- TO HELP. I AND- WHILE I'M- AND MAKING RIGHT DECISIONS IT IS ALSO A GOOD APPROACH AS WELL SO- WITH THAT WHAT WHAT CAN I DO WANT TO JUST ADD ONE CLARIFICATION- WE DID HAVE RECEIVED AN APPROPRIATION RECENTLY A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IT ESCAPE MY HAVE MINDED I'M APOLOGIZE FOR THAT FOUR PLATFORM HOLLY AND THAT WAS- DUE TO THE INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATE WITH THE PRATT- WITH THE PANDEMIC. AS WELL AS PURSUING LEGAL. REMEDIES AGAINST THE TRUSTEE. I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD- MS LOOK HAS HE JUST JUST TO SAY THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE WORKING AND PUSHING OUR FEDERAL COLLEAGUES AS WELL TO MOVE DECOMMISSIONED FORWARD THERE THERE'S CURRENTLY- THEY'RE WORKING ON A- PROGRAMMATIC III ASKED FOR DECOMMISSIONING AND WE NEED TO BE. PUSHING THAT FORWARD AS MUCH AS WE CAN- AND WILL BE WORKING TO DO SO- THANKS FOR THAT I WOULD ALSO JUST NOTE IN THAT IN THAT SAME VEIN THE GOVERNOR I BELIEVE DID PROPOSE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR- WELL REMEDIATION FUND IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR- THE- LEGISLATURE DID NOT- C. A. THE CD THAT REQUEST AND- THAT. THAT ITEM HAS BEEN PULLED OVER- SO THAT MAY BE AN AREA TO LOOK INTO HOWEVER I DO KNOW THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS RAISED. ABOUT SIMPLY PUTTING UP FRONT PUBLIC DOLLARS IN PLACE- EVEN IF THOSE FUNDS MAYBE WERE TO BE MATCHED BY FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH APPEARS TO BE IN THE BUILD BACK BETTER PLANNED. A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR REMEDIATION FUND- WITH THE SORT OF MATCHING COMPONENT I THINK THAT THE MISSING PIECE HERE IS WHAT. WHAT WILL THE OIL INDUSTRY'S PEACE BE- IT FEELS LIKE THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ARE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE BUT- HOPEFULLY IN THESE MORE COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WE CAN. START TO CHART THAT PATH AND FIND A WAY THROUGH THIS- SENATOR MEN DID YOU HAVE ANY OTHER. COMMENTS THERE YEAH I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS- SO I SAID FROM THE DECOMMISSIONING I WAS JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE STATE'S POWERS- OVER PIPES THAT CAME INTO STATE WATERS. AND I KNOW THAT- I BELIEVE IT'S NOW LIKE CONSIDER THE FACT THAT- THE- HEIGHT BEING MAY HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE THAT. IS NOT CLEAR WHEN THE PIPING WAS LAST INSPECTED AND I GUESS MAYBE THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION IS DO WE KNOW. WHEN THE PIPING WAS LAST INSPECTED OR REPLACED- WHAT'S THE APPROXIMATE LIFETIME OF A FIGHT LIKE THIS AND I REALIZE THAT. THIS MAY HAVE OCCURRED FROM AN ANCHOR DRAGGING ALONG THE OCEAN FLOOR BUT I BELIEVE IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE SPILL IN HUNTINGTON BEACH. WAS DUE TO AGING PIPES AND I'M JUST AS I WE START TO THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE STUFF WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTIES AND NINETEEN SEVENTIES. I THINK I'D BE GOOD TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS HAS BEEN UPDATED HOW REGULARLY IT IS REFURBISHED OR FIXED OR WHATEVER THE CORRECT TERM IS- AND WHAT LEVERS WE AS A STATE HAVE TO OVERSEE THAT A REQUIREMENT- SINCE- YOU KNOW I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- ENDING OFFSHORE DRILLING ANYTIME. SOON. WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THE STATEMENT. AT A CERTAIN SO I CAN I CAN- ADDRESS THAT FIRST THEN TURN IT OVER TO DR VOCAL RANGE AND- WELL THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION- MANAGES LEASES- FOR PIPELINES WITHIN STATE WATERS- WE ARE NOT THAT A PIPELINE REGULATORY AGENCY THAT IT DOES LIE WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES ALSO LIVE WITH CAL JAM. SO SAY WITH THAT FOR- PIPELINES THAT ARE SOLELY WITHIN- STATE WATERS- AND UNDER A LEASE WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WE REQUIRE THE PIPELINES TO BE EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY EXPECT- INSPECTED ANNUALLY. AND WE HAVE ENGINEERS ON STAFF THAT REVIEWS THOSE INSPECTIONS- AND CONSULT WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AS WELL WITH OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS- ON ANY TYPE OF REMEDIAL ACTION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THOSE. INSPECTIONS FOR THOSE PIPELINES- THAT- CROSSBOWS FEDERAL AND STATE WATERS INTEREST- STORY- IS MORE LIMITED BECAUSE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S REGULATORY AUTHORITY TAKES- PRECEDENT. AND THINGS THAT IS THE PRIMARY FEDERAL AGENCY THAT REGULATES THOSE INTERSTATE PIPELINES. THEY REQUIRE- INSPECTIONS EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY EVERY TWO YEARS- AND THAT'S WHAT THIS PIPELINE AT ISSUE WAS SUBJECT SUBJECT INTO SO THAT- THAT PLATFORM ALLEY PIPELINE. AT THE TOP OF THAT PIPELINE WAS INSPECTED AT INTERNALLY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AN EXTREMELY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY- THE INTERNAL INSPECTION WAS SET TO HAPPEN AGAIN AT THE END OF OCTOBER- BASED ON THE LAST COUPLE OF INSPECTION REPORTS- FROM OUR ENGINEERS. THERE WEREN'T ANY- ANY EVIDENCE- THAT HAVE PROMPTED- ANY NEED TO DO ANY REMEDIAL ACTIVITIES AT THAT TIME. GOT IT IN JUSTICE THIS IS THE UNDERSTAND- YOU HAVE A RIGHT OF WAY PERMITTING OVER ALL OF THE PIPES RIGHT SO IT WOULD FIT AT THIS POINT WE DON'T ISSUE AND I THIS IS JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES FOR ME BUT- WE HAVE NOT ISSUED NEW PIPING PERMITS- SINCE. FOR SOMETIME IS THAT CORRECT. WELL I AM WE ARE HIGH PLAINLY SAYS ARE DIFFERENT THAN OUR ALL. ACTUALLY SAYS THAT THE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION LEASES AS I MENTIONED I MIGHT- PRESENTATION THOSE DON'T HAVE A FIXED TERM OF YEARS THEY CONTINUE AS LONG AS IT'S ECONOMIC FOR THE OPERATORS TO PRODUCE THE PIPELINE LEASES OR THE RIGHT OF WAY LEASES- DO YOU HAVE FIXED TERMS- AND THERE ANYWHERE BETWEEN TEN. AND FORTY YEARS DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY WERE ISSUED SO WHEN OUR COMMISSION WAS ISSUING PIPELINE LEASES IN STATE WATERS- YOU KNOW IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES THEY ISSUED FAIRLY LONG TERM LEASE SAYS- BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS YEAH. NOW OUR PRACTICE IS TO ISSUE MUCH- SHORTER LEASES SO THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW AND REASSESS- BASED ON THE STATE'S PRIORITIES AND POLICY OBJECTIVES JUST SO THAT I UNDERSTAND. IS IT RIGHT THAT YOU ALSO ISSUE THE RIGHT WAY PERMITS FOR PIPES THAT LEAD TO FEDERAL WATERS YES WE HAVE EIGHT CURRENTLY CURRENT- LEASES FOR PIPELINES THAT- ORIGINATE FROM FEDERAL OFFSHORE OPERATIONS SO LET ME JUST ADD IT BY MYSELF LET'S SAY YOU HAVE A PIPE AND- IT NEEDS TO BE I DON'T I DID THE LEASE TERM AND SOUL. WHAT WHAT POWERS DO YOU HAVE LIKE ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW EITHER STATUTORY OR CONTRACTUAL WAIT TO RENEW THOSE LEASES ISSUE NEW PERMITS OR RENEW THOSE PERMITS ISSUE NEW PERMITS OR ALTERNATIVELY DO YOU HAVE ANY LEEWAY CONTRACTUALLY STATUTORILY. TO END THOSE PERMITS PREMATURELY AND SAY YOU KNOW WE DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE UPKEEP IS A PROPER YOU'RE VIOLATING CERTAIN PROVISIONS WE WE'RE JUST GONNA. TAKE AWAY YOUR PERMIT PREMATURELY DO YOU HAVE ANY LEEWAY LIKE THAT'S I UNDERSTAND I CAN SENSE YOUR FLEXIBILITY BOTH IN ISSUING NEW RIGHT AWAY PERMITS BUT ALSO. IN YANKING AWAY EXISTING PERMITS. CERTAINLY- SO I CAN GIVE ANY. OF ARE LEE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS MOST RECENTLY WITH- I HAVE A PIPELINE THAT SERVES THE PLATFORM'S HOGAN AND HOW CHIN- IN THE SANTA BARBARA CHANNEL THOSE ARE TWO FEDERAL. FORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS THE PIPELINE THAT SERVE THOSE- PLATFORMS DID CROSS INTO STATE WATERS AND CONNECTED ON SHORE. THAT UP PIPELINE LESSEE OF OURS- WAS NOT COMPLIANT WITH OUR LEASE TERMS AND THE COMMISSION TOOK ACTION TO TERMINATE THOSE LEASES BASED ON NONCOMPLIANCE. AND DEFAULT IN BREACH OF THE LEASE TERMS AND- ESSENTIALLY THAT DID TERMINATE UP PRODUCTION ON THOSE TWO FEDERAL. TAX FORMS AND THEY ARE PART OF THE EIGHT FEDERAL PLATFORMS THAT. PHONE JUST ANNOUNCED THEY WERE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT AS PART OF A PROGRAMMATIC EIS FOR DECOMMISSIONING. I THE COMMISSION DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY- AT UNILATERALLY TERMINATE AN EXISTING VALID LEASE- ABSENT ANY EVIDENCE OF A BREACH OR NON COMPLIANCE. AS I MENTIONED OUR PIPELINE LEASES DO HAVE FIXED TERMS SO- THEY DO COME UP FOR RENEWAL AND AS PART OF THAT APPLICATION PROCESS STAFF REVIEWS THAT FOR A COMPLIANCE- AND CONSIDERATION UNDER C. CLASS AS WELL AS CONSISTENCY WITH THE COMMON PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE AND CONSISTENCY WITH WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE- AND AT. STAFF MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS THE COMMISSION ON WHETHER TO ISSUE A NEW LEASE AND UNDER WHAT TERMS NOW WITH THAT SAID- THIS IS WHERE WE GET INTO A COMPLEX AREA OF THE LAW THAT- BECAUSE THESE ARE FEDERAL- THESE ARE PIPELINES THAT SERVE FEDERAL OPERATIONS WE DO HAVE TO BE. AWARE OF AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT- CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS- INCLUDING THE COMMERCE CLAUSE AND OTHER ELEMENTS- THAT WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES HAVE PREEMPTION AUTHORITY- NOW THAT DOESN'T ISN'T THE PRIMARY. FOCUS OF THE COMMISSION BUT IT IS SOMETHING TO BE CONSIDERATE OF AS WE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND- HOW TO STRUCTURE THE LEGAL AND POLICY RAMEWORK FOR MOVING FORWARD TO ACHIEVE OUR POLICY GOALS NOT SHIPPING OUT IT IS VERY HELPFUL AND SO SHIFTING I GUESS TO THE ACTUAL. PLATFORMS- AND THE LEASES- EIGHT EIGHT I KNOW THAT IT'S CAL JAM THAT HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE THE PERMITS ON NEW DRILLING OR EXTRACTION. AND WE DON'T UNFORTUNATELY HAVE A REPRESENTED FROM CAL JAM HERE BUT MAYBE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WHICH IS THE- WHEN. IT SO AS YOU KNOW I BELIEVE YOU AND I DISCUSSED I I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION ENDING DRILLING AND EXTRACTION INCLUDING UNDER EXISTING LEASES AND THAT IS THE MAJORITY LEADER REFERRED TO. DOES RUN IN THE EMINENT DOMAIN TAKINGS ISSUE. NOW SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT WE COULD DO THE SAME THING THROUGH- ENDING PERMITS- REMOVING PERMITS AND I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO WHAT CAL JAM HAS TO CONSIDER EITHER FROM A STATUTORY. PERSPECTIVE OR A CONTRACTUAL PERSPECTIVE IN DECIDING WHETHER OR NOT TO ISSUE NEW PERMITS UNDER THE LEASE IS THAT IT HAS THESE EXISTING LEASES. I WISH I COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE HELPFUL IN ANSWERING THIS I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON CAL JAM STATUTORY AND REGULATORY AUTHORITY- SO- I I'M I'M NOT VERY EXPERIENCED IN TERMS OF WHAT. THEY NEED TO CONSIDER IN ORDER TO ISSUE A NEW PERMIT- FOUR ADDRESS LANE- UNDER OUR OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES. ARE OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES- ALTHOUGH. LEACH THEY ARE- SET. A DAY DO ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE OPERATORS COMPLY WITH- CURRENT- AN EXISTING STATE REGULATIONS AND SO EVEN AS THOSE REGULATIONS EVOLVE AND CHANGE AND BECOME MORE PROTECTIVE. THAT OPERATORS ARE SUBJECT AND REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THOSE INVOLVING REGULATIONS- SO UNLIKE OUR LEASES WHICH ARE STUCK IN THE PAST AS I MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING OF MY PRESENTATION- THE STATE'S AUTHORITY FOR REGULATORY AND OVERSIGHT. WHETHER IT'S CAL JAM OR OTHER REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS AND AUTHORITIES. THE LAST HOUR OPERATORS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO MEET THOSE EVOLVING REQUIREMENTS ASSUMING THAT IT OPERATOR IS COMPLYING WITH THE REGULATIONS COULD WE- JUST DEY WILLINGLY TO DENY THEM A NEW PERMIT FOR NEW DRILLING UNDER EXISTING LEASE. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT THAT IS REALLY UNDER THE GUISE OF CAL JAM AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEIR LEGAL AUTHORITIES GOT IT I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MUCH. OKAY THANK YOU SENATOR MAN A SIMILAR. I'LL JUST BE RELATIVELY BRIEF- BECAUSE I THINK SENATOR MAN EXHAUSTIVELY WENT INTO THE ISSUE AND IF WE WERE REALLY GOING TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THESE AREAS OF OIL POLICY. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND REGULATORY STATUTORY OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF FEDERAL EMINENT DOMAIN AND THERE'S SO MUCH AS THE PERSON. THAT WAS THE SUPERVISOR OF THE PREDECESSOR AGENCY OF CAL JAM FOR EIGHT YEARS IT IS EXACTLY R. A FACT FINDING LEVEL BEFORE YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLICY LEVEL IT IT SO IT WOULD REALLY DO THAT AND THEN I'M SORRY SENATOR HERTZBERG LAST I HAD JUST HAD ONE COMMENT ON HIS COMMENTS. AND THAT IS A SINCE IT MIGHT BE A WHILE SOMETHING THAT SOMEBODY ELSE CONSIDERS I STARTED TO VET THE NOTION OF DOING- RIGS TO REEFS BILL WHEN I WAS IN MY LAST YEAR IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A SIMPLE CONCEPT THAT NO LIABILITY IS RELEASED OF THE OIL COMPANY AND DOING IT THAT THE REQUIRED TO CAP AND CLOSE OFF THE WELL BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE AS IF THE RIG WAS A 100% BEING RENEWED. AND THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ANY DIFFERENCE IN REVENUE- FOR BENEFIT AND ON A PROGRAMS ALTHOUGH IT COULD BE MOVED TO BACKING ORPHAN WELLS- OR OTHER COSTS IN THE FIELD. AND IF THAT SEEMED SIMPLE BUT TO ME AND THE ISSUE WAS BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS AND THIS IS IF SOMEBODY WAS ATTEMPTING IT AGAIN I MEAN. A CENTER. HERZBERG ALLOWED AS TO HOW IT FAILED. IT FAILED BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A LACK OF TRUST IN OUR WOULD SAY JIM THERE. BETWEEN MORE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS AND GENERICALLY MORE OIL PRODUCING COMPANIES ON THE BELIEF THAT SHOULD GET MOST OF THE WAY IN THERE. AND THEN THERE WOULD BE THIS COMPROMISE TO DATE ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE WERE OTHERWISE AND IN THE END. THEY WOULD BE GIVEN SOME RIDE THAT WOULD'VE EXISTED IF THEY WENT THROUGH EXISTING TO A CLOSE AND DECOMMISSION THE WELLS. A. N. THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT I DIDN'T THINK WAS FELT THAT SOMEHOW IN THE PROCESS THEY WOULD BE RELEASED FROM LIABILITY AS WELL. AND SO IF THERE IS A SERIOUS INTENT OF DOING THIS BY SOMEBODY. I THINK THOSE ARE THE MOVING PIECES THAT HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED A LACK OF TRUST BUT IT WOULDN'T REALLY GET BELOW A 100% THERE'S NOT A RELEASE OF LIABILITY AS PART OF IT. AND THEN POTENTIALLY YOU COULD GET THERE BUT I THINK. THE IT. IT IT IN A SUNBURN HURTS BERG WENT RIGHT UP TO THAT AND I THINK THAT IS THE NEXT DISCUSSION. AND THOSE ARE THE FACTS BETWEEN THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD MENTION IT SO THAT. IF ANYBODY IS CONSIDERING IT DOES OR WHAT YOU'D YOU'D HAVE TO DO SO. I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY OF THE- DIRECTOR. OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION BECAUSE- DID. IS THERE SUCH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WELLS SAUNDERS ARE 100% RESPONSIBLE PARTY SOME THERE'S THIS MASSIVE COST SOME THERE'S A SMALL COST. SOME SOMEBODY'S JUST WALKED AWAY FROM AND- IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TRYING TO. ADOPT A STATUTE THAT APPLIES FAIRLY AND RESPONSIBLY FOR THE STATE TO ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SITUATIONS AND I THINK THAT'LL BE THE CHALLENGE AND IN CRAFTING LEGISLATION BUT- I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH ANYBODY THAT IS CRAFTING THE LEGISLATION IF THERE'S ANY WAY THAT I CAN. BE OF ASSISTANCE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO. MAKE SOME COMMENTS WE WILL WE WILL TAKE YOU UP ON THAT OFFER- AND I WOULD SAY WHAT WHAT COULD BE PRODUCTIVE IN ADDITION TO THE THEN. THE. LOOKING FOR SORT OF A- EARLY FIFTIES- OF THE AFTER ACTION REPORT OR SOME RECOMMENDATIONS OR GUIDANCE FOR GOING FORWARD IN ADDITION- IT WOULD HELP TO GET I KNOW STATE LANDS SO I'VE BEEN THROUGH YOUR WEBSITE AND ALL YOUR LEASING- CONTRACTS AND SORT OF YOUR YOUR MAP IN ALL YOUR TOOLS FOR LOOKING WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS AND ALL THE VARIETIES OF. DIFFERENT LEASES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE STATE- BUT TO AGGREGATE SOME OF THAT AND TO REALLY- FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD DRILL DOWN ON- V. THE SORT OF NET AN INDIVIDUAL- LIABILITIES FOR NOT JUST SORT OF POLLUTION COSTS BUT THE DECOMMISSIONING AND REMEDIATION COSTS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE AND HOW THAT MATCHES UP AGAINST THE COMBINATION OF BONDING AND SINKING FUNDS AND MENTION LEANS BUT THOSE OTHER TOOLS AND IF IT IF YOU COULD SORT OF AGGREGATE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION FOR US. PUT IT UP IN AN APPLES TO APPLES WAY SO WE CAN LOOK AT IT AND WITH THE REAL EYE ON WHAT MONEY HERE IS BANKRUPTCY PROOF- WHICH OF THESE FUNDS DO WE KNOW WE'LL BE ABLE TO ACCESS REGARDLESS OF THE WHIMS ARE DECISIONS OF THE PARTICULAR OPERATOR- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE I KNOW A LOT OF THIS IS EXISTING WORK YOU'VE GOT ON YOUR WEBSITE BUT JUST TO BE AGGREGATED IN IN SOME MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY AND PERHAPS A- PACKAGE THAT UP- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS.
