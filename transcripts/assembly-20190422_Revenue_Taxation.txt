WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FREE AYE VOTE -- IS HIGHLY CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BURKE. BURKE AYE BRO. BRO ARE YOU CHU. CHU I'D GRAY MAYES.

MOVING TO FILE ITEM FIVE AB THREE FIFTY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MERRIN SYRIAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WHICH ONE SHOULD I START WITH THREE THREE FIFTY SEVEN PERFECT. MANAGER IN PRESENTING AB THREE FIFTY SEVEN THIS IS A TECHNICAL BILL DEALING WITH THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS. OF TWENTY YEARS FOR THE FTP TO COLLECT ON AN OUTSTANDING TAX LIABILITY MOVE THE BELL. THIS CODE THANK YOU THIS CODE SECTION ALSO INCLUDES FEES ARE LEANS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ORIGINAL TAX LIABILITY THE FTV INTERPRETS CURRENT CODE TO MEAN THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS ESSENTIALLY RESETS. STATUE OF LIABILITY AND COLLECTIONS STATUTE ON THE TOTALITY OF THE INITIAL THAT WHEN THEY ASSESS NEW ADMINISTRATIVE AND COLLECTION FEES -- I WILL CUT SHORT MY PRESENTATION AND GO TO JOSEPH BRACE -- TAX ATTORNEY FROM LOS ANGELES TO FURTHER EXPLAIN YOU SURE ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M JUST BOILS LOS ANGELES I'M A TAX FREE AND CPA I STARTED MY CAREER AT THE IRS TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO AND WORK FOR THE IRISH FOR NINE YEARS. IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THERE IS A TEN YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT BEGINS ON THE DATE OF ASSESSMENT AND EACH ASSESSMENT HAS A TEN YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIA PASSED A TWENTY YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS BUT MECHANICS ARE DIFFERENT THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE IMITATIONS APPLIES TO EACH TAX PERIOD. NOT TO EACH ASSESSMENT AND WITH WITHIN EACH TAX PUREE WHENEVER THERE'S A NEW ASSESSMENT THE TWENTY YEAR PERIOD. SMALL RESTARTS. UP. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT THE FTP CHARGES MANY MANY FEES ANDCOSTS THAT RESTART UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE THESE FEES AND COSTS TO RESTART THE STATURE LIMITATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE FTP FILES A LEADING THE CHARGE OF SIXTEEN TO EIGHTEEN DOLLAR FEE THAT FECAL RESTARTS THE TWENTY YEAR CLOCK. IF A TAXPAYER ONCE INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT THE FTP CHARGES THE THIRTY FOUR DOLLAR FEE FOR THAT STONE. THAT WE START TO THE STATUE MEDICATIONS I DON'T THINK IT WAS THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT TO ALLOW THE THE FTP TO UNILATERALLY RESTART THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. EVERY TIME THE FTP CHARGES A FEE YOUR COST. THIS. THE STATUTE CORRECTS. THE EXISTING LAWS SO THAT FEES AND COSTS DON'T RESTART THE STATUE LIMITATIONS ONLY THE ASSESSMENT. OF ADDITIONAL TAX RESTART TO SET YOU MEDICATIONS. AND I I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. JUST THE FACTS OF THE CALIFORNIA SIDE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS IN WORDS STRONG SUPPORT I WILL LEAVE THIS IS MEASURE ADDRESSES A PRACTICAL TAX APPLICATION ISSUE BY CLARIFYING CURRENT LAW. RELATED TO STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR TAX ABILITY AND STRIKES A NARAL BALANCE OF PROVIDING THE CERTAINTY FOR TAX -- PAIRS WHILE MEETING THE F. T. V.'S ABILITY TO STILL COLLECT TAXES OWED. SO WE THANK THE AUTHOR AND MISTER BOILS FOR BEING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I'M A GREAT SUPPORTER STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND TWENTY YEARS IS PLENTY LONG [inaudible] AGREED [inaudible] AGREED -- THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE THANK YOU. I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BURKE I FOR ARE YOU BRO. ROLL ON EACH YOU. CHIU AYE GRAY MAYES. MAYES I MULLIN THIS. ONE COUNTRY NORRIS THE TRAINERS AYE AYE QUIRK I WORK ON A REVISTA HANG. THE BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU MOVING TO FILE ITEM THE SIX OF AB [inaudible] FIVE SEVENTY SIX OKAY. BUT AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS BILL IN CONJUNCTION WITH ACA TO WILL ELIMINATE THE FINAL REDUNDANCIES OF HAVING MULTIPLE TAX ENTITIES AND ASSIGN THE LAST OF THE BE -- EASE OPERATIONS TO THE RELEVANT EXISTING STATE AGENCIES. AS THE COMMITTEE HAS BEEN INFORMED I HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH MULTIPLE TAX AGENCIES AND INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS ISSUE RIGHT. ALL THE OFFICES INCLUDE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TREASURES OFFICE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OFFICE OF TAX APPEALS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION FEE ADMINISTRATION -- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PERFORMED AN EVALUATION OF THE B. O. E.. AND IT'S PROGRAMS. IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FINANCE DEPARTMENT RELEASED ITS REPORT WHICH FOUND UNDER THE BE -- EASE THEN CURRENT STRUCTURE BOARD MEMBERS WERE ADMINISTRATORS ARBITERS AND ADVOCATES. FINANCE FOUND THAT THE OPERATIONAL CULTURE WITHIN THE B. O. E. IMPACTED ITS ABILITY TO EVEN REPORT ACCURATE INFORMATION. THE DECISION MAKERS OUTSIDE THE BOP. FOLLOWING THE RESULTS FROM THE INVESTIGATION CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED AB ONE OH TWO IN JUNE. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AB WANTED TO STRIP THE B. O. E. OF NEARLY ALL TAX ADMINISTRATION AN APPEAL FUNCTIONS. AND GAVE THE RESPONSIBILITIES TO TWO NEW TAX DEPARTMENTS CDT CD FTA. AND THE TA. AFTER AB ONE OH TWO PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN B. O. E. DRASTICALLY REDUCE STAFF AND ONLY RETAIN FOUR HUNDRED EMPLOYEES WITH FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED WORKERS SHIFTED TO THE NEW DEPARTMENTS. AGAIN THIS BILL WHICH STATUTORILY A SIGN THE LAST OF THE BE -- EASE OPERATIONS TO THE RELEVANT EXISTING STATE AGENCIES AND IS A COMPANION BILL TO A CA -- TO WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE BOP. A WITH ME I HAVE EVAN I'M JOINED BY EVAN GOLDBERG FROM -- CALIFORNIA IS A STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE BEFORE BEFORE WE DO OUR WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WERE SUPER CLEAR WITH THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AB THIS BILL AB FIFTY FIVE SEVENTY SIX IT SIMPLY SETS FOR IT WHAT THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD BE. IN THE EVENT THAT A CA TO WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND VOTED ON BY OUR CONSTITUENTS SO THIS IS SIMPLY A FRAMEWORK THAT WE ARE VOTING ON TODAY WE ARE NOT VOTING ON THE CA I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU GO AHEAD WITNESSES AND SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS EVAN GOLDBERG WITH STATE COMPTROLLER BETTY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND IN SUPPORT OF ACA TO IF AND WHEN IT COMES BEFORE YOU I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS WORK ON THE ISSUE. THANK YOU ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF REQUESTED ADDITIONAL TIME IN THAT REQUEST HAS BEEN GRANTED. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING HOW GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MELINA CO AND I'M CHAIR OF THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR ALLOWING US A FEW EXTRA MINUTES TO MAKE A PRESENTATION TO YOU. AB FIVE SEVEN SIX IS NOTHING NOTHING LESS THAN AN INSTRUMENT TO TERMINATE THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION BOTH AS AN ELECTED BODY AND AS AN AGENCY. THIS BILL IS MORE THAN JUST IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION IF THE VOTERS PASS A CA. TO AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS BILL IS A STATEMENT OF WHETHER YOU CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT GOVERNMENT BY ELECTED AND ACCOUNTABLE. OFFICIALS TO BE AN IMPORTANT THING. IT IS A FAIR QUESTION AND HERE IS MY ANSWER TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION IS ONE OF THE CORE FOUNDATIONS OF OUR SYSTEMS GOVERNMENT. AND AS AN ELECTED BOARD WORKING WITH A HIGHLY SKILLED BE A WE AGENCY STAFF WE ARE CUT ACCOUNTABLE. FOR SIGNIFICANT RESPONSIBILITIES THAT SHOULD NOT BE SENT OFF TO AN UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS IN THE STATE AGENCY. BEFORE VOTING TO TERMINATE THE BE A WE WERE URGE THAT YOU CAREFULLY CONSIDER A FEW THINGS FIRST THE VALUEOF TAXATION WITH REPRESENTATION FOR CALIFORNIANS REGARDING OUR SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM. THIS IS STILL A CORE FUNCTION THAT RESTS WITHIN THE E. AT THE BE A WEEK. WHETHER IT IS REASONABLE AND PRUDENT TO THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE IMPACTS OF AB ONE OH TWO AND CREATING CD TFA AND T. A.. B. FOR PROPOSING ANY FURTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE TAX ADMINISTRATION AND CALIFORNIA AND THIRD AND FINAL WHETHER IT IS REASONABLE AND PRUDENT TO CONDUCT AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACTS ON TAXPAYER RIGHTS. IN TERMINATING THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ASKING AND ANSWERING THE QUESTION IS THERE A BETTER WAY FORWARD. WE ORGANIZE IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND ENDING A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY YEAR PRESIDENT OF TAXATION WITH REPRESENTATION. DESERVES TO BE. MORE THAN SIMPLY CREATING A NEW ORGANIZATION CHART AND HOPING FOR THE BEST WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU VOTE NO ON AB FIVE SEVEN SIX THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BRENDA FLEMING I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION ON BEHALF OF TO BE WE EMPLOYEES AND FOR THE UTILIZATION DISTRICT MEMBERS -- FIVE WE ON BEHALF OF THE AGENCY DO OPPOSE AB FIVE SEVENTY SIX FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. FIRST BILL YEARS RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE STATE'S SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF PROPERTY TAXES -- WHICH INCLUDES THE ASSESSMENT OF OVER FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION IN PROPERTY TAX BY THE FIFTY EIGHT ELECTED I COUNTY ASSESSOR'S. THE UNIQUE NEEDS AND ISSUES OF THE PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BECOME SECONDARY TO THOSE UP TO THE TAX OTHER TAX PROGRAMS. MOVING THE BE -- WE'D BE ALWAYS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE CD TESFAYE OR TO THE TA WHAT ACTUALLY WEEKEND OUR ABILITY TO REALLY DEDICATE OUR PROPERTY TAX RESOURCES THE EMPLOYEES. TO EXCLUSIVELY FOCUS ON PROPERTY TAX FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE WOOD FOR WITH -- CITY TO HAVE A BEFORE AND AND THE PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS A SORT OF A SUBDIVISION -- AND SUBORDINATE TO THAT ROLE. ANY DECISION MEMBERS TO MOVE THIS CRITICAL STATE SERVICE -- OUR PROPERTY TAX PROGRAMS INTO TWO OTHER STATE AGENCY SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY ANALYZED STUDIED AND EVALUATED. TO MAKE THE BEST DECISIONS FOR TAXPAYERS AND FOR THE STATE. SECOND MEMBERS AB ONE OH TWO RESULTED IN ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IN STATE GOVERNMENT AND STATE AGENCIES. IN RECENT TIMES THE TWO WEEK TIME FRAME FROM JUNE FIFTEENTH TO JULY TWO JULY ONE WHEN IT TOOK AFFECT -- HAD A CATACLYSMIC IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYEES OF THE BE -- EITHER FOR BE WE WANT OUT ALL. THE PACE OF THE TRANSITION TASK FOLLOWING THE BILL'S PASSAGE DID NOT PROVIDE FOR THOROUGH DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT ALLOW FOR THOUGHTFUL REVIEW AND THE EVALUATION OF THE CHANGES IT LITERALLY TOOK AFFECT PASSED AND TOOK EFFECT IN TWO WEEKS. AS A RESULT A STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCY HAS BEEN LEFT WITH AN ADEQUATE AND INEFFICIENT AUTHORITIES. RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES TO FULFILL ITS MANDATE ITS STATE GOVERNMENT DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. WE DEFINITELY ARE WEEKEND AS A RESULT OF IT. THIRD MEMBERS ALLEGED BOARD IS ESSENTIAL TO THE B. ALWAYS ABILITIES FOR TO FULFILL ITS DUTIES. UNFORTUNATELY ARE ULTIMATELY FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS THE ELECTED BOARD HAS DEMONSTRATED RESPONSIVENESS JUST HAVE TO STAKEHOLDERS AS A PART OF THE ELECT TOWARD A COMPARED TO AN APPOINTED AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR. FOR THE IMPACT OF ANY DECISION YOU MAKE TODAY RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF PROPERTY TAXES MUST THOUGHTFULLY CONSIDER THE IMPACT ON OUR EMPLOYEES. THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES AS I MENTIONED EARLIER FROM AB ONE OUT TO OUR CURRENT LITERALLY OVERNIGHT ON JUNE THIRTIETH WE RUBIO WE WANT OUT ALL AND ON JULY ONE WE WERE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION. STRIPPED WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR RESOURCES -- IT HAPPENED OVERNIGHT AND THE STAFF HAD GREAT DIFFICULTY ABSORBING THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT IMPACT. AND LASTLY MEMBERS IF I COULD JUST COMMENT WE CANNOT FAIL TO PROTECT THE DUTY -- RB WE DUTY TO PROTECT AND ENSURE OUR ABILITY TO APPLY -- AND SO THE UNIFORMITY OF OUR OUR STATE TAXES AND REALLY FULFILL OUR OUR OUR MISSION -- AS YOU HEARD BEFORE THE COUNTY PROPERTY TAX LEVIES THAT TOTAL OVER SIXTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OUR COUNTY IS SAYS PROPERTY VALUES REACH FIVE POINT SEVEN TRILLION. THE STATUS AS PROPERTIES VALUED HUNDRED FIVE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION ECCENTRIC CETERA AGAIN OUR APPEAL HONORABLE MEMBERS IS TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THOUGHTFUL PROCESS -- THAT MINIMIZES THE IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYEES AND ALLOWS US TO EXCESS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADMINISTER ARE ON PROPERTY TAX FUNCTIONS. AGAIN WE OPPOSE IT -- WITH AFTER CONSIDERATION OF OUR EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP CRAYON HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LANDS OF TAXPAYER ADVOCATES WE ARE A TRADE ASSOCIATION. REPRESENTING TAX AGENTS WHO REPRESENT TAXPAYERS FOR THE COUNTY ASSESSOR ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD AND FROM TIME TO TIME BEFORE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. I WANT -- TO KEY OFF OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND WITH RESPECT TO THIS COMMITTEE -- I'LL KEEP MY COMMENTS US IS SAYING -- THE LONG ROAD TO REFORM IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND ANY COMMITTEE OR THAT HAS JURISDICTION OVER. ANOTHER AGENCY SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT WE THINK THAT THIS MEASURE. DEALS WITH ONE AGENCY AND ONE AGENCY ALONE AND DOES NOT EXAMINE THE TOTALITY OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION AND TAX WOULD YOU TO CATION. SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND IT HAVING SPOKEN WITH MANY OF YOU THERE'S AN INTEREST IN GREATER EFFICIENCY I DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD OPPOSE THAT. WOULD RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT ONE YOU OUGHT TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE TAX AGENCIES THERE ARE CURRENTLY. FIVE NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO THE ISSUE OF OVERSIGHT AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT ELECTED BOARD OF EQUALIZATION WILL PROVIDE MORE ROBUST OVERSIGHT OVER THE ASSESSMENT AND ASSESSMENT APPEALS PROCESS. BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR AND THEIR AUDITS -- THE PERIODIC AUDITS OF COUNTY ASSESSOR'S -- AS WELL AS THEIR REVIEW OF THE RULES THAT GOVERN PROPERTY TAX ADMINISTRATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I CAN TELL YOU THAT I HAVE BENEFITTED GREATLY FROM THIS IS A PRAY AS OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW THAT WE ALL. HAVE OCCASIONALLY -- ARE IMPROVED BY PEOPLE TAKING AN AUDIT OR LOOKING AT US FROM A AN OVERSIGHT PERSPECTIVE. I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF A ROLL OF AN ELECTED BE -- WE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE AND I'LL POINT TO AN EXAMPLE THAT WE HAD. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WITH THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. THERE WERE ISSUES THAT WE HAD WITH ASSESSORS IN ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD. THAT WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITH ASSESSORS -- THAT WERE FINALLY ADDRESSED -- BY B. O. E. MORE -- MEMBERS AND IN FACT IT WAS THE CURRENT STATE TREASURER FIONA MA. WHO REALLY -- TOOK THE ISSUE -- BY THE HORNS AND ENSURE THAT BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THAT THE BOP ADOPTED REFORMS TO THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS BY WHICH PROPERTY OWNERS CAN BRING THEIR THEIR APPEALS. TO THE ASSESSMENT APPEALS BOARD OR SEEK RELIEF FROM THE ASSESSOR. AND FINALLY -- AB FIVE SEVENTY SIX AND WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE I APPRECIATE THOSE BUT LACKS DETAIL IT SIMPLY TAKES THE EXISTING B. O. E.. SPORTS IT APART AND AND SHOVES IT INTO THESE TWO AGENCIES THE ISSUE THAT THE AUTHOR HIMSELF AS ADDRESSED. IS THE ONE OF A A LACK OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF BEING OF HAVING TAXPAYERS HAVE A TRUE -- REPRESENTATIVE ON MATTERS THAT ARE BEFORE THEM EITHER IN TERMS OF STATUS AS PROPERTY OR MATTERS THAT ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LOOK AT FINDING NOT A STAFF MEMBER WHO WILL LOOK TO THE ASSESSOR'S OFFICE AND ASK THOSE IMPORTANT CRITICAL QUESTIONS. BUT THAT'D BE A PEER WHO IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL AS WELL -- WITH FOR THAT WE ASK FOR YOUR COULD YOUR CONSIDERATION IN YOUR NOTEBOOK. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SAID NGUYEN LOMBARD ON THE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. CHAIRMAN BURKE VICE CHAIR BRAWL HONORABLE MEMBERS THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WANTS TO EXPRESS. OUR FIRM OPPOSITION OF AB FIVE SEVENTY SIX WHICH WOULD END THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND ELECTED REPRESENTATION. CORD DEDICATED SPECIFICALLY TO TAX ISSUES. WE ARE VERY PERPLEXED THAT THERE ARE SUCH DEDICATION AMONG SOME OF OUR FRIENDS TO END THE BOARD OF IT OF EQUALIZATION WHICH REPRESENTS. TO THE TIME WHEN THE FIRST TWO ELECTED AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE SERVED ON THE BOARD WOULD BOTH SERVING AS CHAIR WE ARE NOT ATTEMPTING TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS HERE. BUT WE WOULD LIKE. WE WOULD. BE SORELY REMISS TO NOT RAISE THE QUESTION. BEFORE YOU VOTE TODAY. AS YOU KNOW ACCORDING TO OUR MISSION STATEMENT THE CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WOULD STRENGTHEN OUR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS IN THEIR REGIONS AND OPERATIONS. AND TO ADVOCATE ADVOCATE POLICIES WHICH IMPROVE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFRICAN AMERICANS ABOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA. PART OF OUR PROVIDING SERVICE TO OUR MEMBERS IS HAVING REPPERT IF. ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO CAN TURN TO WHO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS AND INTERESTS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING STRONG BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IN AFRICAN AMERICAN EIGHBORHOODS. WHEN IT COMES TO TAXES WE WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT BLACK BUSINESSES PAY TAXES? IN ADDITION TO INCOME TAXES SALES TAXES AND USE TAXES PAYROLL TAXES WE ALSO PAY PROPERTY TAXES. IT IS NOT JUST CONVENIENT FOR OUR BUSINESSES TO HAVE ELECTED OFFICIALS TO TURN TO WHEN WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT TAXES. OUR UP TO OUR COMMUNITIES NON PROFITS ALSO NEED ASSISTANCE AND NAVIGATING THE COMPLEX WORLD OF CALIFORNIA'S TAXATION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT OUR MEMBERS TO BE DIRECT HAVE A DIRECT LINK TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO CAN LISTEN WITH INTEREST AND BE OUR ADVOCATES WHEN NECESSARY. IT IS WRONG TO TAKE AWAY OUR OPPORTUNITY TO ACCESS DIRECTLY TO FACE TO FACE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE PREPARED TO REPRESENT AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES. WELL WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT FAIR AND EQUITABLE TAX TREATMENT. IF YOU VOTE YES ON AB FIVE SEVENTY SIX YOUR CLOSING THE DOOR IN OUR FACE. OF THESE AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES IF YOU TELL US THAT WE SHOULD SETTLE FOR CALLING BUREAUCRATS. AND HOPING THAT THEY WILL RETURN OUR CALLS. THIS BILL IS TELLING US SOMETHING STRANGE ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN OUR COMMUNITIES NEED REPRESENTATION ON SO MANY ISSUES. THE REPRESENTATION FOR US IS NO LONGER IMPORTANT. ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE HAVE. OF REPRESENTATION ON THE BOP. IF OUR FOUNDER OVER STONE. WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE. AND NEW WELL. WHAT WAS GOING ON TODAY HE WOULD SHAKE HIS HEAD IN AMUSEMENT? HE WILL BE SADDENED BY AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND SETTLE FOR LESS THAN FULL AND COMPLETE REPRESENTATION. WE ARE HERE ASKING FOR THE ELECTED OF A REPRESENTATION FULL AND COMPLETE REPRESENTATION CONTINUE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN BUSINESSES. WE ASK FOR YOU TO PLEASE VOTE NO ON AB. FIVE SEVENTY SIX ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NINE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. JUST THE ONE THE GENTLEMAN THAT SPOKE TO TALK ABOUT THERE'S FIVE DIFFERENT TAXING AGENCIES -- IT IS THE GOAL WITH CD TFA TO BECOME THE ONE STOP SHOP FOR ALL -- FIVE AGENCIES IS IS THAT THE GOAL. THE END THAT'S THE CONVERSATION WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING AS WELL HI I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT'S I'D LIKE TO SEE US GET TO SOME PLACE. OF WHERE WE HAVE A TAX AGENCY THAT COULD BE A SERVE AS A ONE STOP SHOP -- I THINK THE ACA. MORE SO THAN THIS BILL. IS WHERE WE REALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THIS MERELY JUST SAYS IF THE ACA WERE TOUGH PASS. BOTH HOUSES IF IT WAS TO PASS A PUBLIC VOTE. HOW WOULD WE DETERMINE WHAT THE REST OF THE DUTIES CURRENTLY? THAT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION HAS IS -- DISSEMINATED AND ADDRESSED. SO. I WOULD LIKE FOR US TO ACTUALLY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK -- THERE IS ALSO FRUSTRATION. ABOUT -- THE NUMBER OF PLACES THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO GO TO LET ALONE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ALSO DEALING WITH NOT JUST FEDERAL STATE. AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIONS FOR TAX PURPOSES. IN LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S THE BUSINESS TAX THAT. REALLY CREATES -- A LOT OF CHALLENGES FOR SPECIALLY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT OPERATE OUT OF THEIR HOME. AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY END UP MISSING THE DEADLINES AND THEN HAVE TO FIND OUT AFTER SUS SEVERE PENALTIES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED SO. I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT AS A FORMER SMALL BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF I I RECEIVE THOSE NOTICES. SO I I AM HAPPY TO DISCUSS MOVING FORWARD HOW THAT GETS ADDRESSED. SO THEN THE SECOND. IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. AND IN FOR FOR SOMEBODY LIKE ME THAT WANTS TO WANTS GOVERNMENT TO BE EFFICIENT -- I DON'T PHILOSOPHICALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH REORGANIZATION FACT I THINK IT WOULD MAKE SENSE. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO TO DO THAT I'M SOMEBODY WOULD WOULD ADVOCATE FOR A ONE STOP SHOP. I HAVE ONE AGENCY THAT COLLECTS ONE STATE AGENCY COLLECTS ALL THE STATE. A STATE REVENUE -- BUT IN THE SECOND QUESTION IS WILL WHO IS THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OF OF THAT -- SHOULD IT BE A BUREAUCRAT -- THAT MAKES THOSE DECISIONS -- SHOULD BE SOME OF ITS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR SHOULD THERE BE A BOARDS APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE LEGISLATIVE LEADERS OR SHOULD THOSE BE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT MAKE -- THAT THE THAT MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS -- TO MAKE THOSE THOSE DECISIONS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT I HEAR FROM -- THE FOLKS THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS THAT THEY WERE BUT THAT THEY WERE VOTED BY DULY ELECTED. BY THE PEOPLE OF OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND WE SHOULDN'T LET THOSE DECISIONS BE MADE -- PUT PUT IN THE HANDS OF OF OF OF ANOTHER BOARD I REALIZE THAT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS -- AND THE AND THE AND THE BUT THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US BUT IT DOES STILL APPLIED IS STILL GERMANE. TO THE CONVERSATION SO -- YOU KNOW GET WHAT WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON THAT IT'S GERMANE AND AND I I WAS SMILING AS YOU WERE SAYING THIS BECAUSE YOU KNOW UP WHILE WHILE WE WOULD ALL DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THAT ISSUE IT ALSO TAKES A CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN A STAFFER. FOR A LONG TIME AND SEEN WHAT REPRIEVE TO CONSTITUENTS MEANS -- JUST TO USE THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE JUST LET YOU ALL VOTED ON WHICH EIGHT THANK YOU -- FOR A. B.. THREE FIFTY SEVEN THIS IS A ISSUE THAT CAME TO ME BECAUSE OF A CONSTITUENT. WHO HAD PENALTIES? AT LEVELS WHERE. THERE WAS NO WAY HE WAS GONNA MAKE THOSE PAYMENTS. AND IF IT WAS RUNNING FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. AND SO WHEN WE WORKED WITH. FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. WE THEN STARTED TALKING TO DIFFERENT ATTORNEYS. OF GOING BACK TO WHAT WE WOULD DO A STAFFERS AND AND WE REALIZE THAT. COURSE MY STAFF WAS DOING THIS AND WE REALIZE THAT THERE WAS A BILL IN NEED TO ADDRESS. AND CHANGE THE PRACTICES IN PLACE WHEN WE TALK TO FTP THEY SAID THAT THEY HAD WANTED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE THEMSELVES. BUT THAT THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE. TO AND SO WE OFFER TO DO A BILL AND WORK WITH THEM. TO ADDRESS IT -- REASON WHY I BRING THIS UP IS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. TO LISTEN TO OUR CONSTITUENTS AND ADDRESS THE NEEDS IF. THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO CAME TO ME. HAD COME TO YOU AND YOUR DISTRICT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME -- IN FACT I I WOULDN'T OF TURN THEM OVER TO ANY OTHER AGENCY I WOULD CALL THE AGENCY MYSELF AND SAY. I WANT TO KNOW EDUCATE ME ABOUT WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING OR WHY THIS ISSUE IS FALLING APART. AND WHY IS IT THAT. THIS HASN'T BEEN ADDRESSED FOR THIS LONG OF A TIME. WE'VE ALL AT AND ANOTHER PART OF THIS IS THAT WE EVOLVE. AND WHAT WE SAW THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO WE WE SEE THAT WE MIGHT NOT NEED AT THIS POINT. BECAUSE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE CORE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY. THAT OF WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BETTER MAKE SURE THAT FTP OR OTHER AGENCIES HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED HOW WE MIGHT NEED TO CHANGE. THE WAY THEY CURRENTLY DO THINGS SO THAT THESE ISSUES ARE BETTER ADDRESSED. RATHER THAN TRY TO HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT OFFICES. EACH ONE POINTING FINGERS. I THINK I THINK THAT'S BEEN ALL OF OUR STRUGGLE I KNOW AS CHAIR OF AGING AND LONG TERM CARE THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IN THAT SPACE. IS THAT AREA SEEMS TO HALL HAVE BEEN DECIDED UPON BASED ON DEFAULT RATHER THAN THERE BEING A PLAN. AND AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS BEEN SOMEWHAT. QUICKLY AT A QUICKLY BUT THIS IS BEEN AN AREA WHERE INSTEAD OF HAVING ONE PLACE. UP WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE AND AND IT'S DISSEMINATED OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE SO. VERY LONG ABOUT ANSWER BUT BUT I HOPE BY ADDRESSED SEVERAL ISSUES IN. ONE ONE RESPONSE. AND IF I DID AND I'M HAPPY TO AND THEN MY MANAGER IF IT'S OKAY ONE FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION IN IN REGARDS TO TIMING ON THIS IF THE ACA'S MOVING MOVING FORWARD. AND THAT'S GOING TO GO BEFORE THE VOTERS IS IT NECESSARY TO HAVE -- THIS LANGUAGE -- MOVE IN IN THIS -- THIS YEAR OR WOULD TELL ME TO TALK ABOUT THAT OR CAN WE WAIT UNTIL AFTER THAT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IS IS ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS TO BE ABLE. TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING SO THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE AC DOESN'T HAVE A TIME LINE NECESSARILY. THAT THEN AND THAT'S WHY ONCE IT GETS REFERRED TO A COMMITTEE AND AND IT WASN'T REFERRED AND YET BECAUSE OF THE COMPETING BILLS HAVING TO DO WITH FISCAL RELATED ISSUES. SO ONCE THAT'S VOTED OUT AT THAT POINT WE CAN DISCUSS THE MERITS OF THAT ISSUE FOR AS LONG AS WE WANT WE CAN PUSH IT. INTO NEXT YEAR AS WELL. BUT BECAUSE OF THIS BILL HAVING -- TIMELINES INSERT SPECIFIC DEADLINES ASSOCIATED WITH POLICY AND FISCAL AND THEN FLOOR VOTE. WE AYE THIS AYE AYE WE PRESENTED IT THIS YEAR SO THAT IT MOVES FORWARD -- AND AT SOME POINT WE CAN ADDRESS THE THE MAIN ISSUES AND OBJECTIVES THROUGH THE ACA -- THAT'S ONE OF AND I HOPE BY. RESPOND AT THE HEART OF THE ISSUE OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I DON'T WANT TO GO ON TOO LONG. SO IN A ROOM. ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO. ASSEMBLY MAN I MISSED THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION DID YOU AGREE TO TAKE THE AMENDMENT. SO -- IF THE AC OR TO PASS IT DOESN'T AFFECT THE CURRENT COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD THAT THE EFFECTIVE DATE WOULD BE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IF THE ACA WERE TO PASS OR WOULD IT TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON PASSAGE -- I DON'T WE CAN'T BUY PASSED THE ACA SO THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN UP IN THE ACA WHICH RIGHT A LOT WILL BE JUST. THERE'S GOING TO BE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS FOR THE ACA WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED YES THE AUTHOR THAT THAT THAT. THAT THOSE KIND OF CONVERSATIONS THERE THERE WILL BE A MUCH MORE IN DEPTH CONVERSATION WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THE ACTUAL ACA WHICH THAT NEEDS TO BE A PORTION OF THE ACTUAL HCA OKAY NOT THIS PARTICULAR PORTION NOT THIS COMPANION NOW OKAY. THIS -- JUST HONESTLY. AS HARD AS IT IS TO SEPARATE THIS IS JUST A BASIC STRUCTURE IF THE ACA IS TO MOVE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE PROCESS. SO I TOLD THE SETTLEMENT -- EARLIER TODAY I AM UNDECIDED ON THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION OF WHETHER NOT TO ELIMINATE THE BOARD I'M STILL FEELING MY WAY THROUGH THAT GIVEN THAT WE'VE. WE'RE JUST COMING OFF OF A MAJOR RESTRUCTURING OF THE B. O. E.. AND THE FUNCTIONS OF THE BE -- A LOT DO WE EVEN KNOW WITH THE EFFICACY OF THOSE CHANGES WHILE WE'RE CONTEMPLATING ANOTHER CHANGE -- SO I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS JUST RUN TIMELINE IN PHASING. I'M GONNA LEAVE THE THE SORT OF ULTIMATE VOTE -- ON A SEE A AN OPEN QUESTION UNTIL WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS. OF SO WANTED YOU. TO BE AWARE OF THAT -- I THINK WHAT'S GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF PAUSE IS ARE ARE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS I'VE BEEN CONTACTED BY FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS THIS IS GETTING GETTING QUITE A BIT OF ATTENTION. NOW AND AGAIN I DID SUPPORT THAT THAT RESTRUCTURING. AND AND THINK THIS IS A VALID CONVERSATION TO HAVE -- BUT DO WE ELIMINATE AN ELECTED BOARD -- WHICH IS A CONDUIT FOR THE TAXPAYERS AT A TIME WHEN I HOPE WE ENGAGE IN A FULL FLEDGED CONVERSATION AROUND TAX REFORM. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE'VE GOT A HIGHLY VOLATILE -- TAX STRUCTURE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PROPOSITION THIRTEEN CORPORATE LOOPHOLE CHANGE ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BALLOT WHICH I HOPE WILL ENCOURAGE A LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND THE WAY WE DO TAXES IN CALIFORNIA. SO -- I'M LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE IN THE BROADER CONTEXT OF HOW ALL OF THESE THINGS. WORK TOGETHER. OR COMING UP WITH A STRUCTURE THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE SO THAT. THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION I'M I'M STILL GRAPPLING WITH BUT AS FAR AS WHAT REMAINS IN THE BILL TODAY TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL STAKEHOLDER. A CONVERSATIONS ALL SUPPORT THE BILL. TODAY BUT WOULD WELCOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU PRIMARILY ABOUT HOW THIS CHANGE. FITS INTO THE LARGER CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE AROUND. TAX REFORM AND HOW WE MODERNIZE THE WAY WE DO ALL OF THIS. AND I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS FITS INTO THAT. BUT I APPRECIATE YOU PUSHING THIS CONVERSATION I THINK IT'S ONE WE NEED TO HAVE. I DO HOWEVER THINK WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THE TIMELINE ISSUES THE BALLOT SCHEDULE. IN ALLOWING SOME TIME FOR THE REFORMS. TO THE EVALUATED BEFORE WE CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL ACTION. BUT ALL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. BUT WELCOME A BROADER CONVERSATION WITH THE CHURCH LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU [inaudible] MR GRAMM. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR ALL REFLECT THE COMMENTS OF BOTH MY COLLEAGUES -- OUR COMMAND THE AUTHOR IN. WORKING TO CREATE A MORE EFFICIENT. STRUCTURE FOR THE TAXPAYER -- YEAH THAT'S CERTAINLY AN ONGOING EFFORT THIS INSTITUTION TO BE ANCIENT. LIKE MISTER MALL AND I HAVE -- RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE ELIMINATION THE BOP AND IN FACT. EVEN THE RESTRUCTURING THAT THIS BODY UNDERTOOK -- PREVIOUSLY -- I'VE HAD SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT -- THE WISDOM OF THAT. GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE. YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT HAS HAD IN WORKING WITH. IRAN ON ELECTED WATER BOARD -- AND THE STAFF. AT THOSE INSTITUTIONS -- GIVEN EXPERIENCE MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IT HAD AT THE DMV IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS THIS BODY. HAS NOT DONE A GREAT JOB OF OVERSIGHT OF AGENCIES AND WE'VE SEATED A GREAT DEAL OF AUTHORITY. A YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT PARTICULARLY DURING THIS ERA OF TERM LIMITS WITH THE LEGISLATORS COMING AND GOING EVERY THREE OR FOUR YEARS ON AVERAGE -- AND AT THE END OF THE DAY I STRUGGLE WITH THE IDEA OF THESE BENEVOLENT DICTATORSHIPS. RIGHT DEMOCRACY NOT BUREAUCRACY. NEEDS TO BE OUR NEEDS TO BE OUR TEAM AROUND HERE AND THEN TELL THIS INSTITUTION -- RE ENGAGES IN A SERIOUS MANNER AND OVERSIGHT. I DON'T KNOW. IF YOU STEPS APPROPRIATE RIGHT -- I UNDERSTAND THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY. SET IN PLACE TO STRUCTURE. IF THE ACA WERE TO PASS. HAVING SAID THAT THE OTHER THING. THAT'S BECOME ALL TOO COMMON PLACE -- HERE IN OUR INSTITUTION IS THIS NOTION OF MOVING THINGS ON DEADLINES [inaudible] THERE'S NOTHING. IT FRUSTRATES ME MORE THAN TO BE AND YOU KNOW LAST POLICY COMMITTEE OF THE SECOND HOUSE AND HAVE SOMEONE SAY -- IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. AND TOO OFTEN WE HEAR THAT RIGHT WHERE WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE FIRST CALL SEE COMMITTEE OF THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE FIRST YEAR OF A TWO YEAR SESSION. WITH AN ACA THAT WOULD BE SET TO BE ON THE BALLOT. IN A COUPLE YEARS RIGHT -- SO I DON'T SEE THE NEED TO RUSH FORWARD I THINK THIS IS A CONVERSATION IMAGE ENGAGING WITH YOU ON TO THE BENEFIT. OF THE TAXPAYER BUT I'M NOT YET CONVINCED THAT WE HAVEN'T GONE TOO FAR IN THE DIRECTION OF BUREAUCRACY AND MAY WE NEED TECH TAKE A FEW STEPS BACK TOWARDS ACCOUNTABILITY -- TOWARDS CHECKS AND BALANCES -- AND NOT THIS NOTION OF BENEVOLENT DICTATOR STATE RUN AROUND -- AGENCIES THAT THOSE OF US WHO WORK HERE EVERYDAY CAN'T NAVIGATE. YOU KNOW WE GO WORK IN OUR DISTRICT OFFICE AND TRY TO HELP CONSTITUENTS NOW TO GET SOME OF THESE -- PROCESS AND THAT CAN BE -- INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING EXPERIENCE. FOR US -- AND PROMOTION FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS SO UNFORTUNATELY I'M GONNA LAY OFF THIS BILL TODAY -- BUT I'M GOING TO CONTINUE -- ENGAGING WITH THE AUTHOR AND AND HOPE THE AUTHOR EMBRACES A DISCUSSION ABOUT HER PRIVATE SOMETHING THAT -- BENEFITS TAXPAYER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATIONS AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AS WELL AND AND I THINK FOR THE MOST PART WE AGREE -- AND HAVING HAD THE BENEFIT OF BEING STAFFERS IN THIS INSTITUTION AND SEEN HOW DIFFICULT SOME CHANGES HAVE BEEN -- I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD -- TO GAINING YOUR TRUST AND CONFIDENCE NOT TRUST BUT YOUR CONFIDENCE ON THIS ISSUE -- AND AND I THINK -- AS IS I MAY HAVE MENTIONED TO YOU I HAD ASKED LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO DRAFT. THIS BILL LAST YEAR. THE ONLY REASON I DECIDED NOT TO INTRODUCE IT WAS BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE THERE WAS SOMETHING BEING BRUSHED. I THOUGHT LET ME INTRODUCE AT THE BEGINNING OF A START OF A TERM. SO THAT WE CAN. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THAT THE ISSUE AND AND DISCUSS. SO -- I TO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I I HOPE I CAN CONVINCE YOU OTHERWISE THANK YOU. QUIRK. YEAH -- I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE VOTERS HAVE AN IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN. IF THE IF WE DO ABOLISH AND THAT'S GOING TO BE UP TO THEM ULTIMATELY IF WE DO ABOLISH. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION AND I THINK THIS BILL -- PROVIDES A WAY TO DISCUSS THAT AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE -- YES I AGREE WITH SOME OF MY FELLOW MEMBERS THAT TAX REFORM IN A MUCH LARGER CONTEXT AND MODERNIZATION OF OF OUR TAX CODE IS IMPERATIVE AND WE DO NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND IT IS A VERY CHALLENGING CONVERSATION AND THAT WILL TAKE YEARS AND ITSELF. HOWEVER -- AS THE REPRESENTATIVE THE BE A WE EMPLOYEES HAD MENTIONED THAT WHEN WE DID MAKE THE LAST CHANGE THEY WERE FORCED TO MOVE VERY QUICKLY. AND THERE WAS NO STRUCTURE IN PLACE WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN. SO THIS THIS ITEM BEFORE US IS NOT THE ACA IT'S NOT A DECISION AS TO WHETHER WE WHAT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BE -- YOUR WHAT HAPPENS. TO THE WAY WE PROCESS THESE THINGS MOVING FORWARD BUT IT IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A STRUCTURE IN THE EVENT THAT THEY MAKE A DECISION. THE ACA TO TO VOTE ON A CA. TO WITH THAT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO MENTION TO THE CHAMBER THE AFRICAN AMERICAN CHAMBER HERE. THAT -- AS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ELECTED OBVIOUSLY THIS BODY IS VERY CONSCIOUS AND VERY AWARE OF OF THE TH OF THAT OUR BODY AND OUR COMMUNITY IS REPRESENTED IMPOSSIBLE AND AND POSITIVELY REFLECTED. AS AN ELECTED AND I THINK WE'VE DONE THAT QUITE WELL. THE ACA WILL HAVE THIS IS NOT THE ACA BUT ACA TO WILL HAVE A STRENUOUS PROCESS IT WILL HAVE STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE BE A WE DOES HAVE EMPLOYEES BECAUSE THEY DO REPRESENT AND THEY ARE PROCESSING. THE THING A LOT OF OUR CALIFORNIANS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF OUR MONEY SO THIS WILL BE AN ONGOING PROCESS I APPRECIATE YOU AS THE AUTHOR UNDERSTANDING THAT WE PLAN ON HAVING THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ON THAT MEASURE. ON THIS MEASURE HOWEVER YOU HAVE A TO PASS ON TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

BEES FROM THE STATE PORTION OF THE SALES TAX UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IN ORDER TO ADVANCE THE DEPLOYMENT. OF CBS IN CALIFORNIA. CEROMITIA BUSES RELY A BATTERY ELECTRIC AND OR HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES AND ELIMINATE EXPOSURE TO CONTAMINANTS. UP EXCEPTIONALLY BENEFITING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT UTILIZE TRANSIT AT HIGHER RATES CURRENTLY ALMOST HALF OF THE STATE'S BUS POPULATION CONTAINS DIESEL ENGINES WHICH AMID A COMPLEX MIXTURE OF AIR POLLUTANTS THAT CAUSE CANCER. PREMATURE DEATH AND HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS TOP CONTRIBUTORS TO CLIMATE CHANGE MANY TRANSIT AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA BEGUN TO REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS BY DEPLOYING Z. BEES. AND DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF THE CLEAN TRANSIT REGULATION IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS NOW REQUIRING THE STATE'S TWO HUNDRED PUBLIC TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BEGIN PURCHASING. Z. BEES AS SOON AS TWENTY TWENTY THREE WITH THE GOAL OF CONVERTING ALL BUSES OPERATING CALIFORNIA'S ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES BY. TWENTY FORTY HOWEVER THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THE DIESEL ALTERNATIVES AND TRANSIT AGENCIES ARE OFTEN CASH STRAPPED LOSING MONEY AT THE FARE BOX.

NO UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRANSITION IS GOING TO BE EXCEEDINGLY EXPENSIVE WE DID OUR OWN ESTIMATES OF WHAT THIS COSTS BUT THE COST WILL BE AND WE ASK MIDDLE BE UPWARDS OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS. SO TO COMPLY FULLY WITH THIS INNOVATIVE CAN TRANSIT REGULATION I TRANSIT AGENCIES WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED AND GROWING STATE SUPPORT -- WITHOUT A CASH STRAPPED TRANSIT AGENCIES WE FORCE TO MAKE DIFFICULT DECISIONS -- WITH THEIR FINITE BUDGETS POSSIBLY SACRIFICING ROBUST RAN TO SERVICE TO PURCHASE AND PLAY THESE MORE EXPENSIVE BOSSES -- AT A TIME WHEN BMT IS RISING AND SEE STRUGGLING ENCOURAGE MORE CALIFORNIANS TO CHOOSE TRANSIT OVER THE CARS. WE CAN ALLOW THE STREET OFFICE -- TO TO MANIFEST WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE TAX EXEMPTION PROVIDES WOULD AUGMENT THE SUPPORT THE STATE HAS ALREADY PROVIDED THROUGH PROGRAMS LIKE THE H. FIP. ALLOWING TRANSIT AGENCIES TO BRIDGET GRADY PORTION A GREATER PORTION OF THE INTERNAL COSTS OF THESE BUSES. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR EITHER THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BURKE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M RIGHT INSURED WITH CAL START OR TECHNOLOGY CONSORTIUM THIS AND WORKING FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO ACCELERATE THE COMMERCIALIZATION.

TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AS A RESULT OF CALIFORNIA'S KIND OF POLICIES POLICIES ZERO EMISSION BUS MANUFACTURERS ARE NOW SETTING UP SHOP IN THE STATE. INCLUDE PATEROS MOTIVE YOU ID CHANGE GREEN PARTY MOTORS COMMONS AND MANY MORE -- MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IT'S GENERALLY ARE ONE OF THE STATE'S MOST CONCENTRATED SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PRODUCING OVER -- WE'RE FIFTH OF THE EMISSIONS WITH ONLY ABOUT 3% OF THE VEHICLES. THESE EMISSIONS AND POLLUTES IMPACT LOW INCOME IN THIS AGE VAN COMMUNITIES FIRST AND WORST -- AND LAST DECEMBER THEIR RESOURCES WERE ADOPTED THE INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT RULE THAT REQUIRED TRANSIT AGENCIES TEND TO CONVERT THEIR BUSES TO HUNTER PERCENT ZERO EMISSIONS OVER TIME -- WITH WITH THAT IN MIND WELL THIS REGULATION IS MOVING US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION YOUR MISSION BUSES STILL COST A PREMIUM COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL DIESEL POWER TO NATURAL GAS BUSES. AND AT THE SAME TIME TRANSIT AGENCIES STILL NEED TO COMPLETELY DEVELOP NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THE TAKES MANY YEARS TO INSTALL. AND AND ALSO COME TO TERMS WITH A WHOLE NEW WAY OF OPERATING CHARGING AND MAINTAINING THEIR VEHICLES THE STATE'S EXISTING INCENTIVE PROGRAMS INVESTING IS AB TODAY ARE CRITICAL BUT THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH. MORE FUNDING IS NEEDED AND IT IS NEEDED FOR MULTIPLE YEARS OUT. ON THE MANUFACTURING SIDE IT TAKES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS TO BRING A NEW PRODUCT TO MARKET AND MANUFACTURERS ARE UNLIKELY TO DEVELOP THE THE NEWER. AND AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED UNLESS THEY HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE FUTURE DEMAND -- FROM FROM THE STATE. INVESTING IS ABS ALSO SUPPORTS OUR MISSION TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO OTHER TECHNOLOGIES BEYOND -- BY BUS -- WE MUST CONTINGENT AS THEMSELVES OR TO CREATE A NETWORK THE FACT THAT WILL DRIVE MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION DO IS FULL PART IN REDUCING EMISSIONS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF RECOMMENDING SEVERAL TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS IN THIS BILL WHICH I DO ACCEPT AB EIGHTEEN WOULD IMPOSE A STATEWIDE EXCISE TAX OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. ON THE SALE OF EACH HAND GUN AND SEMI AUTOMATIC RIFLE THE REVENUE WOULD ADD FUNDS TO THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE IN INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM CAL THAT. TAX FUND THE EXCISE TAX ON FARM RETAILERS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL IS ANALOGOUS TO THE FEDERAL AID IN WILDLIFE RESTORATION ACT. COMMONLY CALLED THE PITMAN ROGOSIN ROB ROBERTS AN ACT WHICH IMPOSES A 10211% FEDERAL TAX ON THE SALE OF GUNS AND AMMUNITION BY MANUFACTURERS PRODUCERS AND IMPORTERS. REVENUES FROM THE PITTMAN ROBERTSON TAX WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A LEGISLATIVE MODEL BY THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION FUND WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EFFORTS THAT REMEDIATE THE FACTS. FARMS HAVE ON WILDLIFE POPULATIONS THROUGH GAME HUNTING. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BOLSTER VIOLENCE PREVENTION INITIATIVES SO THAT THEY ARE COMMENSURATE WITH OUR STATE'S TOUGH GUN LAWS IN AS EFFECTIVE AS BOUNCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS OF OTHER STATES. STRONGER SUSTAIN INVESTMENTS IN CALVET WHICH THIS BILL WOULD HELP PROVIDE WOULD ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO REPLICATE THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS OF MASSACHUSETTS AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES TARGETED VIOLENCE.

OTHER STATES ESPECIALLY NEW YORK AND MASSACHUSETTS HAVE ACHIEVED REMARKABLE REDUCTIONS AND GUN VIOLENCE BY BOTH STRENGTHENING THEIR GUN SAFETY LAWS AND COMMITTING SIGNIFICANT ONGOING FUNDING. TO EFFECTIVELY TARGETING VIOLENCE INTERVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAM GRANT PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PROVIDES COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO CITIES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE BASED VIOLENCE REDUCTION INITIATIVES -- CALVET THIS CALPERS ONLY DEDICATED SORT OF SOURCE OF STATE FUNDING EXCUSE ME FOR THESE INITIATIVES AND HAS PROVIDED CRITICAL SUPPORT TO ADDRESS ON MY LANDS IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE MOST IN NEED -- HOWEVER AND UNFORTUNATELY STATE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN WOEFULLY INADEQUATE OVER THE YEARS AB EIGHTEEN LEVINE WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CALVET PROGRAM BY STATUTE AND PLACE A REASONABLE SURTAX ON THE FIREARM INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO FUND THOSE PROGRAMS THROUGH COMPETITIVE.

ADDITIONALLY GUN OWNERS PAY WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE TRUSTEE BUT IT'S REALLY MADE UP OF SEVERAL DIFFERENT PC OF THE NINETEEN DOLLAR DROZ FEE. WHICH IS ACTUALLY -- SUPPOSED TO GO TOWARDS BACKGROUND CHECKS AS WELL AS THE THE THE TRANSFER REGISTRY -- THAT IS GOING TO POTENTIALLY BE DOUBLED THIS YEAR AND ANOTHER OF PIECE OF LEGISLATION BEFORE THIS BODY -- WE HAVE THE ONE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY ACT THE WE HAVE THE FIVE DOLLAR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT FEE -- INITIALLY THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY CERTIFICATE FEE. THAT IS REQUIRED TO PURCHASE A FIREARM AS WELL STATE AND LOCAL TAXES GUN OWNERS ARE PAYING MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE -- BILLS LIKE THIS AS WE CONTINUE TO ADD ON OR JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO PRICE PEOPLE OUT OF THE MARKET TO LEGALLY PURCHASE FIREARMS WITHOUT MORE OPPOSITION THANK YOU.

ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA ONE ISSUE THAT WE HAD HAVE NOT DISCUSSED. AND THAT IS THE ACTUAL CONSTITUTIONALITY OF CHARGING A TAX ON THE EXERCISING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT -- HAS BEEN -- CONTROVERSIAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE. IN THE PEOPLE WILL SAY WHY HASN'T -- ANYBODY CHALLENGE THE PITTMAN ROBERTSON ACT -- EXCISE TAXES JUST THEY HAVEN'T CHALLENGED IT YET BUT NOW THERE IS A CHALLENGE TO ATTACKS IN THE FORM OF CAT LOVERS UNITED STATES THE SUPREME COURT HAS OPENED UP A DOCKET. TO ACCEPT DOCUMENTS AND AND BRIEFS ON THIS CASE THIS SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGES THE CONSTITUTIONALITY. OF ADDING AN EXCISE TAX ON THE EXERCISING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT -- THE COURT'S GOING TO DECIDE THAT AND AND THIS ISSUE MAM MAYBE DECIDED FOR YOU MAY BE OUT A WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE COURT SAYS.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF THAT OUR JOBS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION AND WE'RE OPPOSED. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SOME OF MARYLAND AS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MR LEVINE HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THE AMOUNT OF TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. YEAH I THINK YOUR QUESTION -- THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT A NEW IDEA THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS IN PLACE IN OTHER PLACES IN OUR COUNTRY. SO COOK COUNTY ILLINOIS CHICAGO IS THERE HAS A TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR TAX SEATTLE AS WELL HAS ONE SO THIS HAS SEEMED TO WORK HAS NOT HAD UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. AND THAT IS HOW WE LANDED ON THAT FIGURE OKAY SO I GUESS. YOU KNOW I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS THE STATE'S THAT YOU -- REFERENCED WHICH ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAD MUCH FEWER PEOPLE SO I'M JUST NOT SURE THAT IT'S A ONE SIZE FITS ALL WITH RESPECT TO THE AMOUNT. IN. GIVEN THAT WE HAVE SO -- I GUESS YOU KNOW SO MANY OTHER. WAYS FOR MONEY TO GO INTO VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND ONE PERSON THINGS LIKE THAT WHAT. AMOUNT OF MONEY -- IS ENOUGH. TO STOP GUN VIOLENCE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE A MUCH LARGER DIALOGUE ABOUT THIS WOULD CREATE POTENTIAL ABOUT TWELVE TO THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OF FUNDING EACH YEAR WELL THAT FOR YOU KNOW A THIS I AGAIN I THINK THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE BUT THAT'S WHAT WE PROJECT. THAT THIS WILL COLLECT FOR THE STATE. I CAN ADD TO THAT ASSEMBLY MOMENT OF NOW THANK YOU -- I JUST I'M YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WE HAVE MONEY THAT GOES TOWARDS YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THIS ARE READY RIGHT. IN SO WE KEEP ADDING ON I GUESS NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE A CLEAR VISION OF HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S NEVER. GOING TO BE ENOUGH AND I THINK WE SHARE OBVIOUSLY -- THE DESIRE -- TO REDUCE VIOLENCE -- IT'S JUST A MATTER OF OF HOW WE DO THAT BUT THANK YOU -- ANSWERS I APPRECIATE THAT -- TIME THE TEMPORARY CHAIR -- BILL BRO IS HERE. WELL I'M NO LONGER THE TEMPORARY CHAIR THE VICE CHAIR IS HERE. ALL. I CAN FINISH THE BELL IF YOU'D LIKE ALL RIGHT DOES ANYONE ELSE WISH TO SPEAK ON THE BILL -- SAID THE CHAIR'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS IS APPROPRIATED. AS SHE'S ME AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BOB PERSONALLY. I DON'T THINK THIS TAX IS THE RIGHT WAY TO SPOT TO FUNDED HOWEVER I DO THINK WE NEED TO FIND THAT AND FIND A BETTER MECHANISM. ON THAT BASIS I'M GOING TO VOTE HI TODAY SO WE CAN CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO FIND THIS -- THAT HAS A BETTER NEXUS. THAT BEING SAID WE NEED A MOTION -- ALL MOVED TO BAIL [inaudible] MISS. A REVISTA SECONDS THE BELL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BURKE.

AS CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO PRESENT OUT AND WE'LL DO THIS -- QUICKLY WE APPRECIATE THAT. THE FACT THIS HAS SUPPORT SUPPORT -- BACK IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN I WORKED ALONGSIDE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OF MARK WITHIN AND RICH GORDON TO RESURRECT THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT PROGRAM THE PROGRAM ALLOWS. HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE SENIORS AND THOSE WHO ARE BLIND OR HAVE A DISABILITY TO POSTPONE PAYMENT FOR PROPERTY TAX ON THEIR RESIDENCES. THIS REALLY UP REMAINS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE UNEXPECTED INCREASES IN A TAX BILL. CAN OFTEN TIMES -- FORCE THESE HOMEOWNERS ON A FIXED INCOME TO SELL THEIR HOMES EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T WANT TO HAS LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE EVALUATED. THE PROPERTY TAX POSTPONEMENT PROGRAM AND PROVIDED A VARIETY OF OPTIONS TO IMPROVE IT. AB SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN WOULD IMPLEMENT THE LA OWES RECOMMENDATION TO REFINE THE PROGRAM'S BASE INCOME LIMITS. THE LOWER THE INTEREST RATE AND ELIMINATE THE GENERAL FUND SWEEP. THIS ENSURES THAT NOT ONLY IS THE PROGRAM EQUITABLE AND AFFORDABLE BUT THAT HOMEOWNERS CAN SAFELY RELY ON ITS LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. THIS BILL ENJOYS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES AND I'M PLEASED TO AGAIN JOINED TOGETHER WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MARC. ELEMENTARY -- IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM WE HE HAD TO BE -- ELSEWHERE FOR I THINK IT'S FIVE MORE BUFFET -- COULDN'T BE HERE BUT AT LEAST FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT WAS HERE RECENTLY WASN'T. WE APPRECIATE HIS -- AUTHORSHIP AS WELL WE HAVE DO HAVE WITH US -- MISS M. HOLLINGSHEAD WHO IS A SENIOR FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYST FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WHO IS HERE TO PROVIDE. A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON THEIR REPORT AND BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF YOU WOULD LIKE. I AM CALLING SAID WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST NOTED ON HERE IN AN INFORMATIONAL CAPACITY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE -- PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROGRAM AS IT EXISTS TODAY -- AND OUR OFFICES REPORT THAT WE RELEASED LAST YEAR I'M JUST WANT TO REITERATE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS WHERE WE DO TAKE. POSITIONS ON GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS IN THE POLICY COMMITTEE PROCESS WE DON'T EVER TAKE A POSITION ON BILL SO NEITHER FOR AGAINST -- SO THIS PROPOSAL -- THIS PROGRAM THE PROPERTY TAX PUT POSTPONED PROGRAM AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS WAS FIRST ESTABLISHED IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN IT WAS SUSPENDED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE AND REESTABLISH IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ESSENTIALLY OPERATES LIKE A LOAN PROGRAM WHERE A HOMEOWNER CAN APPLY TO THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE AND HAVE THEIR CURRENT YEAR PROPERTY TAXES POSTPONED ON THEIR BEHALF TO SEE WILL JUST PAY THOSE PROPERTY TAXES ON THEIR BEHALF. HOMEOWNERS CAN QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM IF THERE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY TWO BLIND OR DISABLED IF THEY HAVE HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND IF THEY OWN AT LEAST 40% EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES THE HOMEOWNER OR THEIR HEIRS DO NEED TO EVENTUALLY REPAY THE STATE WITH INTEREST THAT INTEREST RATE IS CURRENTLY SET AT 7% -- AND THAT THAT ODDS THAT A HOMEOWNER CAN DEFER THOSE REPAYMENTS INDEFINITELY -- REPAYMENTS ARE JUST TRIGGERED IF THE HOMEOWNER CELLS THEIR HOME IF -- SOMEONE INHERITS THE HOME OTHER THAN THE SPOUSE AND AND THERE'S SOME OTHER CONDITIONS AS WELL -- THE PROGRAM IS ALSO IMPORTANTLY SELF FUNDED SO DISBURSEMENTS ARE FOR NEW APPLICANTS ARE COVERED AT THE COST OF THOSE ARE COVERED -- BYE BYE COLLECTIONS FROM FROM YOU -- FROM EXISTING POSTPONEMENTS -- OUR P. R. EVALUATION MADE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD -- SO -- IDENTIFIED SOME ADVANTAGES AND SOME SHORTCOMINGS OF THE PROGRAM HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THOSE IN MORE DETAIL BUT IN THE INTEREST OF TIME ALL STOP IT THERE. THANK YOU TO SHOW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MR TERM MEMBERS IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL BE BRIEF TO DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY. AND MEMBERS ALL JUST SAY OTHER THAN PROPOSITION THIRTEEN THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE REGARDING CALLS THAT WE GET TO OUR OFFICE IS ON THE PROPERTY TAX PROS FROM A PROGRAM. IT'S INCREDIBLY VALUABLE VALUABLE FIRST SENIOR MEMBERS. AND IT KEEPS INDIVIDUALS IN THEIR HOMES AND I THINK AS SOMEONE AND AS PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTED THE AMERICAN DREAM OVER THE YEARS THAT'S HIGHLY HIGHLY VALUABLE -- SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND ESPECIALLY WE ARE DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF THE LOWER INTEREST RATE AND WANTING TO SEE THAT -- IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE GREATER ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM WOULD ASK FOR AND I HAVE A THANK YOU INITIAL SUPPORTERS. SEEING NONE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WISHING TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS QUIRK. YEAH -- ALL RIGHT MY PROBLEM IS THAT IF YOU KEEP THE INTEREST RATE THIS LOW IT'LL DESTROY THE PROGRAM AT LEAST THAT'S THAT'S MY READING FROM THE LA A REPORT. WHICH SUGGESTS 5%. ARM I COULD VOTE FOR THIS IF YOU WOULD. TAKE THE LA -- SUGGESTION AND EITHER MAKE IT 5% OR MAKE IT A FLOATING RATE. BUT SETTING IT EXACTLY AT THE PMR HIGH A RATE. YOU'RE NOT EVEN MAKING UP FOR INFLATION. I COULD ACCEPT SOMETHING LIKE PM MY A PLUS INFLATION OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THAT THIS WILL DESTROY THE PROGRAM IT'LL NO LONGER BE SELF FUNDING. CAN YOU CONVINCE ME OTHERWISE. WELL IT IF THE LA -- WANTS -- TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION -- I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A TECHNICAL QUESTION I I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THIS -- THAT. WOULD. THE BILL ENJOYS SUPPORT SUPPORT AND I HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED TO CONSIDER OTHER AMENDMENTS AS BEST I CAN TELL. WELL I'M IN. SO THAT PART OF THAT AS PART OF THE AMENDMENTS THE AUTHORS AGREED TO THE FOLLOWING THREE OKAY CHANGES RATE 25% -- PERFECT THEN.
