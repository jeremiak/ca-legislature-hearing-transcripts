TRANSACTION. HE'S ON THE FIRST PAGE. WITHIN THE AREA. MS JACKSON I SEE THAT YOU'RE. BILLS ARE SLATEDFOR SUSPENSE -- WAVING PRESENTATION ON SB ONE SEVEN ONE BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO PRESENT ON THE OTHER. THREE IF I MAY BRIEFLY. THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL ALL RIGHT I SB FIFTY FIVE FIREARMS PROBATED PERSONS THIS IS A SUSPENSE CANDIDATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND THE REASON I WANTED -- TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY. IS THAT -- I SAW THE ANALYSIS AND I THINK THERE WE MIGHT HAVE A SOMEWHAT OF A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T. TO BUT THIS IS A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKELY TO ABUSE FIREARMS FROM POSSESSING THEM. IT DRAWS ON RESEARCH THAT SHOWS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN CERTAIN ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED CONVICTIONS. AND FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE. THIS MEASURE ADD SEVERAL CRIMES AS A RESULT OF THAT RESEARCH TO THE LIST OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS THAT RESULT IN A TEN YEAR PROHIBITION ON FIREARM OWNERSHIP. NOW RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE. TWENTY FIFTEEN THROUGH THE VIOLENCE PREVENTION RESEARCH PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS AND IT HAS REVEALED AN IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN A CONVICTION FOR AN ALCOHOL RELATED CRIME. AND LATER FIREARM ABUSE. SB FIFTY FIVE TRANSLATE THESE RESEARCH FINDINGS INTO PUBLIC POLICY IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT GUN VOTE FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE. BY ADDING SEVERAL RESEARCH CORRELATED CONVICTIONS. TO THE LIST OF TEN YEAR PROHIBITIONS OF GUN POSSESSION -- THEY WILL ADD TO OUR STATE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST THE APPS LIST. AND THE COSTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR NUMBER -- DOES NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL BE SUBJECT TO THIS SO -- THE RESEARCH AT ANTICIPATED ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE PER YEAR. WOULD BE. THEN INCLUDED ON THE PROHIBITED PERSONS LIST AND I'M VERY HAPPY TO DISCUSS. THE PARTIAL -- RETROACTIVITY ISSUE THAT IS MENTIONED HERE SO IF WE MADE THIS FULLY RETROACTIVE I COULD SEE WHERE YOU MIGHT END UP HAVING TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT PEOPLE'S RECORDS AND I COULD SEE THAT IS A PROBLEM. IF WE MAKE IT PARTIALLY RETROACTIVE SO THAT. IF A PERSON IS PUTTING IN -- TWENTY TWENTY CONVICTED OF A D. Y.. AND IN THAT RECORD THE COURT OBSERVED THAT THEY HAVE HAD THE REQUISITE NUMBER OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS. THEN THE COURT WOULD THEN APPLY THE PROHIBITED PERSONS RESTRICTION WHICH WOULD THEN BE REPORTED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AT A RATE OF AND NO MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED A YEAR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE SEEMS. JUST -- OUT OF WHACK IF YOU WILL SO -- HAPPY TO WORK THROUGH THAT IF THAT IS INDEED THE BASIS UPON THAT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR FIGURE BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS -- DOESN'T CORRELATE CERTAINLY WITH MY EXPECTATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO SO I WOULD LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FURTHER WITH YOU ON THAT AND SEE IF WE COULDN'T -- TRY TO COME TO A NUMBER THAT SEEMS AT LEAST OR IS. MORE REALISTIC IN TERMS OF WHAT THE BILL WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL. I THINK ANY EYEWITNESSES I'M SORRY. YOU HAVE A QUESTION A SURE. GO AHEAD. IS IS YOUR DISPUTE OF CENTER JACKSON WITH THE ACTUAL THE OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE WHAT UNIVERSE WILL BE USING THE PUBLIC DEFENDER BECAUSE THEY'RE ACCUSED OF A NEW CRIME BECAUSE THE VIOLATE THIS TEN EUROPEAN OR IS IT. THAT THE IN THE WOULD HAVE THEIR OWN PRIVATE ATTORNEY OR SET THE COSTS THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S AND BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S WOULD HAVE. IS A THIS -- BASICALLY WHAT WE ANTICIPATE IF WE DO A PARTIAL RETROACTIVITY IS THERE WOULD BE A NEW OFFENSE. SO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE COUNSEL ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OR WAIVE THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL. SO IT'S A NEW OFFENSE THEY'RE COMING WITH THE VIOLATED. OF THE FIREARMS. AS WELL AS A NEW DO YOU WHY. FOR INSTANCE RIGHT WELL I THINK THERE THERE ARE SOME OF THOSE LOGISTICS WE CAN WORK OUT -- BECAUSE THERE MIGHT BE THERE'S ARGUABLY A QUESTION ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE VIOLATING THE LAW BUT BUT THEY WILL ONLY. IF WE IF WE MAKE THAT ADJUSTMENT THE THEY WILL ALREADY EITHER HAVE COUNSEL OF SOME KIND BECAUSE OF THE NEW OFFENSE. CLEARLY -- NOT. PLEASE WORK WITH OUR STAFF TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING MORE SPECIFICITY. BECAUSE AS REFLECTED IN THE ANALYSIS AT SOME OF THE UNKNOWN FACTORS THE DISCRETIONARY -- COMPONENTS TO THIS THAT MAKE IT HARD TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO COST SO SO A YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY OPEN HAVING YOU WORK WITH HER AFTER TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE WITH US DR KAREN WENT TO MOVE UP NEW TO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THIS PROGRAM AT UC DAVIS AND WHO DID THE RESEARCH ON THIS. AND PERHAPS IF YOU HAD ANY QUESTIONS SPECIFICALLY HE'S PREPARED TO ANSWER IT OR WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON RESEARCH. SO THAT THE GREAT THANK FORGET THANK YOU. FOR ALL RIGHT -- ANYONE. DO YOU HAVE ANYBODY WANTS TO SAY A BRIEF COMMON IN FAVOR. OR PERHAPS START TO WIN TO ME TO YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY YOU KNOW SAY. YOU COULD GIVE A BRIEF COMMENT THAT WOULD BE GREAT. OF COURSE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I CAME FROM TEN MINUTES AWAY I WORK HERE IN SACRAMENTO I MEANT I MEANT ANY OUR DOCKET UC DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER -- SENATOR JACKSON ASKED ME TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE THE FISCAL BENEFITS OF ENACTING SB -- FIFTY FIVE I'VE BROKEN THIS DOWN INTO GROUPS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BECOME PROHIBITED PERSONS BASED ON DO YOU AYE CONVICTIONS. I BASS WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY ON DATA WE HAVE COLLECTED ON MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND LEGAL PURCHASERS OF FIREARMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR ESTIMATE BASED ON THOSE REAL DATA. IS THAT EACH GROUP OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PERSONS UNDER CURRENT CONDITIONS IF NOTHING WERE DONE -- IN EACH GROUP ON AVERAGE THIRTY SEVEN WOULD BE ARRESTED SUBSEQUENTLY FOR A VIOLENT CRIME. TWENTY TWO FOR A VIOLENT CRIME INVOLVING A FIREARM SEVEN FOR HOMICIDE RAPE ROBBERY OR AGGRAVATED ASSAULT WE ALSO KNOW FROM OUR PRIOR RESEARCH THAT THIS SORT OF PROGRAM. REDUCES THAT RISK BY 25230%. IT'S WORTH POINTING OUT THAT THE COST TO DIRECTLY TO GOVERNMENT OF A SINGLE FIREARM HOMICIDE IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE TOTAL SOCIETAL COSTS. OUR SIX POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PREVENTING JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE CRIMES WOULD COMPLETELY OFFSET THE COST OF EXPANDING THE PROHIBITION. THANK YOU -- OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MR TURN MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLUTION ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES CITY ATTORNEY MIKE IF YOU'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MIKE SKIP ON BEHALF OF ALCOHOL JUSTICE IN THE CALIFORNIA ALCOHOL POLICY ALLIANCE WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. AND BELIEVE WILL HELP TO REDUCE STATES FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR COSTS OF ALCOHOL RELATED HARM THANK YOU. I CAN'T CORAIL ON ON BEHALF OF THE CELL SACRAMENTO. SENIOR CITIZENS ALLIANCE WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF ANYTHING THAT WILL REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MEASURES THANK YOU. USE ARE THERE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA -- AS AS IT'S BEEN POINTED OUT WE HAVE GREAT CONCERNS ABOUT THE WHOLE CONCEPT THE PRE CRIME. AND AND GOVERNMENT GOING AFTER PEOPLE WHO THEY THINK MIGHT GROUP COMMIT A CRIME SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. THE PHYSICAL ASPECT OF THIS IS THIS WOULD LIKE TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT -- THIS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO BRING THE APPS. NUMBERS DOWN. AND IN FACT THEY BROUGHT IT DOWN FOR AWHILE WE'RE BACK OVER TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ON THAT LIST. THIS IS GOING TO THE ESTIMATES OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST. TO CHECK THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE APPS I THINK IS IS PRETTY -- CONSERVATIVE IN WILL PROBABLY END UP BEING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EXPENSIVE SO FOR THOSE REASONS GUNNERS CALIFORNIA'S IN OPPOSITION. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS LIKE ME RIGHT GRIFFIS BECOME HAPPY CALIFORNIA RIFLE PISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION MOSTLY FOR THE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBLY PLACED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT CLOSE FINANCIAL BURDENS TAKEN THEIR ATTENTION AWAY FROM TRUE VIOLENT CRIMINALS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN OFF OUR STREETS. AT THE SAME TIME THAT BILLS ARE GOING THROUGH THIS BUILDING THAT REDUCE THOSE PENALTIES ON KNOWN VIOLENT CRIMINALS. LIKE SB SIX TWENTY A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND SO FORTH WE NEED TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON KNOWN VIOLENT CRIMINALS AND NOT. A MISDEMEANOR FOLKS MAKING MISTAKES THANK YOU THANK YOU JUST FINANCE HAVE A FILE. THE FILE FILE MISS JACKSON WOULD YOU LIKE. TO MAKE A CLOSING COMMENT IN. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES -- THE FACT THAT THE ABSOLUTE STEWS IS NOT COMPLETED I BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECOGNIZED THIS AND THAT THERE HAS BEEN AND THAT THE THIS COMMITTEE ALSO WAS AGREED TO ADD ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THAT'S NO REASON NOT TO TRY TO PROTECT AGAINST FUTURE GUN VIOLENCE THIS THE MEASURE IS BASED UPON ACTUAL RESEARCH. AND FOR YEARS MANY OF US HAVE HYPOTHESIZED AND THE THROUGH -- ANECDOTAL INFORMATION WE BELIEVE CERTAIN THINGS WE FINALLY IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ACTUALLY PUT MONEY INTO CREATING A RESEARCH. FACILITY TO LOOK AT GUN VIOLENCE THE RESULTS ARE THE ARE REFLECTED IN THIS BILL WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE. WHO HAVE? DEMONSTRATED THE INABILITY TO MAKE GOOD JUDGMENTS AND HAD THREE OR MORE. A D. Y. CONVICTIONS AND OTHER ALCOHOL TYPE RELATED OFFENSES. DURING THE PAST TEN YEARS OR FOUR TO FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY. TO USE A FIREARM IN A FUTURE CRIMINAL ACT THAT IS THE RESEARCH THAT IS UNCONTROVERTED WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS WAS JUST ARTICULATED IS TO PREVENT THE COST NOT ONLY THE SOCIAL COSTS BUT THE FISCAL COST TO SOCIETY. AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK FIVE MILLION IS AN ACCURATE NUMBER BUT WHATEVER THAT NUMBER IS IS FAR LESS THAN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE KIND OF VIOLENCE THAT WE SEE FROM THESE PEOPLE. WHO ARE HAVE THE GREATER PROPENSITY TO BEHAVE IN A WAY THAT INFLICTS FIREARM BASED HARM ON OTHERS AND WITHOUT -- I WOULD TO A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO CONTINUE WRKING WITH THE COMMITTEE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN UNDER FOUR THANK YOU SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS WITHOUT OBJECTION SB FIFTY FIVE WILL GO TO SUSPENSE. SB ONE SIXTY EMERGENCIES CULTURAL COMPETENCE IS ALSO A SUSPENSE. ITEM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THIS MEASURE I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU BECAUSE IT IS A BILL THAT DIRECTS COUNTIES TO INTEGRATE THE NEEDS. OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INTO THE NEXT UPDATE OF THEIR COUNTY EMERGENCY PLANS. AS WE SEE CLIMATE CHANGE AND WILDFIRES IN MAJOR AND DRAMATIC. EVENTS OCCURRING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OUR NATION AND INDEED OUR WORLD. IT IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO DO BETTER TO ADDRESS COMMUNITIES WHO OTHERWISE ARE NOT PROVIDED WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. OR PROTECTIONS WHEN THESE EVENTS OCCUR. DURING A HEARING OF OUR JOINT LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE POINT WAS MADE THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR COUNTIES TO HAVE A STAFF MEMBER PROFICIENT. IN A LANGUAGE THAT IS SIGNIFICANT WITHIN A COMMUNITY IT ALSO REQUIRES THE COUNTY TO HAVE A COMPLEMENTARY AND COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE CULTURAL AND SOCIAL THE DYNAMICS OF THAT COMMUNITY WHICH WE REFER TO AS CULTURAL COMPETENCE. SO THIS MEASURE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL EMERGENCY PLANS TO COLLABORATE WITH QUALIFIED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS IN ORDER TO DISCUSS AT A MINIMUM. HOW ALL CULTURAL POPULATIONS WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION ARE SERVED BY EMERGENCY COMMUNICATIONS EVACUATIONS AND SHELTERING MITIGATION PREVENTION PLANNING AND PREPAREDNESS AND THE EXAMPLE I LIKE TO USE TO SORT OF GIVE YOU A SENSE? OF HOW THIS DOES AND DOESN'T WORK IS DURING THE THOMAS FIRE WHICH OCCURRED IN MY DISTRICT. A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO OF A FIRE STORM THAT OCCURRED OVER THE COURSE OF FORTY DAYS. TOOK OUT ALMOST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES IN WAS UNTIL THE FIRES THIS YEAR THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE HISTORY CALIFORNIA. THE WAY IT WAS. UNUSUALLY EXPLAINED TO THE SPANISH SPEAKING COMMUNITY USING GOOGLE TRANSLATION WAS THAT THERE WAS A HAIR BRUSH FIRE GOING ON CLEARLY WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. IN WARNING PEOPLE IN EXPLAINING TO THEM WHAT'S GOING ON IN ADDRESSING. HOW VARIOUS COMMUNITIES CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES PROTECT THE COMMUNITY WHEN THESE EVENTS HAPPENED? I NOTE THAT THE CUMULATIVE COSTS ARE ESTIMATED TO EXCEED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT IS. PROBABLY CORRECT I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S QUITE SURE WHAT IT WOULD BE BUT AGAIN IN TERMS OF SAVING LIVES PROTECTING PROPERTY -- I FEEL THAT THIS IS A MEASURE THAT. DOES -- CALL OUT FOR THE KIND OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION THAT I KNOW THIS COMMITTEE WILL GIVE. CAN YOU HAVE WITNESSES WHO WANT TO SAY BRIEF COMMONER. THE MORNING CHAIR PORTANTINO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SYLVIA I DON'T KNOW I'M WITH COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT COORDINATOR. A C. B. E. BILLS PEOPLE'S POWER ACROSS CALIFORNIA'S -- LOW INCOME AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO ACHIEVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE -- WE ARE A MEMBER ORGANIZATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE A COSPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG SIDE THE WOMEN'S POLICY INSTITUTE WOMEN'S FOUNDATION OF CALIFORNIA. I IN ADDITION TO SENATOR JACKSON'S COMMENTS WE URGE YOU. TO VOTE YES ON SB ONE SIXTY SO THAT LOCAL COUNTIES -- CAN STRENGTHEN THEIR EMERGENCY EXISTING EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS -- AND IT'S REALLY AS ADDRESSING AN ESPECIALLY THE NEEDS OF CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES -- SO THAT WE SAFEGUARD AND PROTECT -- THESE FOLKS FROM THE INCREASING THREATS OF DISASTERS FIELD BY CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE WORKING WITH -- CALLOW YES AND LOCAL COUNTIES TO UNDERSTAND THE EXISTING ENGAGEMENT LEVELS -- WHEN THEY ARE PRODUCING EMERGENCY PLANS AND HOW COUNTIES CAN LEVERAGE EXISTING -- FUNDING SOURCES AND SO JUST YOU KNOW ABOUT A MONTH AGO THROUGH AB SEVENTY TWO GET THE NEWSOM. ANNOUNCED FIFTY MILLION -- THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS CAMPAIGN AND THIS IS SPECIFICALLY TARGETING OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO BOLSTER AND INCORPORATE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT -- AND SO WE DON'T ENGAGE CULTURALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN THIS PROCESS OF EMERGENCY PLANNING -- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES ARE PRODUCING AN EFFECTIVE PLANS -- WHICH ARE EVIDENT FROM THE DISHEARTENING STORIES THAT WERE COMING OUT OF THE RECORD BREAKING THE WILD FIRES A SO SB ONE SIXTY RESPONSE. TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR COUNTIES AND ULTIMATELY PROTECT THE SAFETY OF EVERYONE SO THANK YOU -- FOR THE TIME AND I RESPECTED RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. YES GOOD MORNING -- CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S TINA ROBINSON LOCAL POLICY ASSOCIATE WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK. WE WORK WITH ASIAN AMERICAN IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITIES. IN THE BAY AREA MANY OF WHOM HAVE LOW EDUCATION LEVELS AND LOW ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH -- FOR EXAMPLE THE CHEVRON -- FINDING IT THE LARGEST DISTRIBUTOR IN THE STATE -- JUST HAD MULTIPLE ACCIDENTS AND EXPLOSIONS -- AND HAVE WORKED WITH THEM -- TO DEAL WITH THE EMERGENCY PLANS -- SB ONE SIXTY A SOUND POLICY THAT SEES THE IMMINENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL DISASTERS AND OFFERS A PROACTIVE AND INCLUSIVE MEASURE. TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ARE PART OF PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE. OF CALIFORNIA'S FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES ARE INFORMS PREPARED AND ENGAGED NOW IT REDUCES THE COST AND RISK FOR ALL WHEN EMERGENCY STRIKES. PREVENTION AND MITIGATION ARE ALWAYS MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN AN UNFORESEEN PROBLEM OR UNEXPECTED AFTERMATH. AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE EXPENSIVE TECHNOLOGY AT RISK TO FIRST RESPONDERS OR OVERTIME FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS. CREATING A STANDARD FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THAT HELPS COUNTIES ACHIEVE CULTURAL COMPETENCY AND THEIR SPECIFIC DEMOGRAPHIC AND GEOGRAPHIC NEEDS IS A COMMON SENSE INVESTMENT INTO A SAFER MORE PREPARED CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. OTHERS WANT TO JUST SAY ME TO PLACE. MORNING -- THIS IS DAN OF US BECAUSE OF POLICY MANAGER FOR CALIFORNIA ROOMS JUST ELAINE STRONG COSPONSORED THE BILL BEEN ALSO NO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE CENTER REYES PROPERTY NUMBER. THINKING. HI I'M SYLVIA CHIEF FROM THE ASIAN PACIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL NETWORK AND I ALSO WANT TO REGISTER STRONG SUPPORT FROM BECAUSE CENTRAL COAST ALLIANCE. UNITED FOR SUSTAINABLE ECONOMY. ANYBODY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE THIS FINANCE HAVE A FILE NO FILE FILE SEEN -- QUESTIONS MISS JACKSON YOU WANT TO MAKE A QUICK CLOSE BURKE QUICKLY TRISTA FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS THIS IS A WAY TO MAKE SURE WE CAN DO THAT SO. RECOGNIZING ITS AS SUSPENSE CANDIDATE I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST CONSIDERATION IS A CAUSE. FOR THANK YOU WITHOUT OBJECTION SB ONE SIXTY WE'RE GONNA SUSPENSE YOU'RE WAITING PRESENTATION ON SB. ONE SEVEN ONE REMOVED SB THREE FORTY SIX AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. SO -- THIS IS. ONE OF THOSE KINDS OF MEASURES THAT WAS. CREATED AS A MARKET BASED TYPE OF PROGRAM WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE YMCA. WE BROUGHT THIS MEASURE IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN A CALL THE DASH DISTINGUISHED AFTER SCHOOL HEALTH. AND IT IS A PROGRAM THAT RECOGNIZES AFTER SCHOOL. PROGRAMS PROMOTING HEALTHY DIETS AND EXERCISE. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE MORE THAN 38% OF THE CHILDREN OF THIS STATE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE EITHER OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. WE KNOW THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IN TERMS OF HEALTH ISSUES AS THESE ARE CHILDREN AS THEY GROW. WHETHER IT'S THE DIABETES HEART DISEASE AND TRUST THE GENERAL MALAISE OF OBESITY. SO THE DASH PROGRAM. ATTEMPTS TO CREATE GOOD HABITS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS BY REQUIRING REGULAR IN ONGOING NUTRITION EDUCATION. HAVE A REQUIRES AN AVERAGE OF THIRTY TO SIXTY MINUTES TO DALY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. LIMITED TIME SPENT IN FRONT OF TELEVISION AND COMPUTER SCREENS AND ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES. PROVIDES ONLY HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS INCLUDING FOODS VEGETABLES SNACKS AND BEVERAGES THAT DO NOT HAVE ANY ADDED SUGARS. AND SAFE AND HEALTHY DRINKING WATERS THE PRIMARY. SOURCE OF REFRESHMENT DURING THESE PROGRAMS THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SORT OF BASIC STUFF. BUT THESE ARE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO HELP YOUNG PEOPLE DEVELOP BETTER HABITS AND WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS IS THEIR SELF RECOGNIZED. IF I RUN AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE DASH CERTIFIED I MAKE THAT APPLICATION. I IDENTIFY WHAT CALLING MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND IN ITS FIRST TWO YEARS OVER A HUNDRED NINETY AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS SOUGHT AND RECEIVED THE STASHED CERTIFICATION FROM SHASTA COUNTY DOWN TO SAN DIEGO COUNTY. THIS IS A VERY COST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM TO TEACH GOOD HABITS TO YOUNG PEOPLE AND ASSURE THAT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS PROVIDE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND SO WITH ME I HAVE ALESSANDRO ESPINOZA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS -- IN A I THINK IT WAS -- LAST YEAR -- THE DEPARTMENT OF ED AND ESTIMATED OR ACTUALLY NOW CURRENTLY I BELIEVE THEY ESTIMATE THAT THEY'LL BE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS NECESSARY EQUIVALENT OF ONE POINT ONE POSITIONS.

SCHOOL SHOULD ALSO OFFER HEALTHY PROMOTE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AND I'LL PROVIDE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR -- LOOKING FORWARD TO BUILDING OFF THE SUCCESS BACK FROM -- TWENTY SIXTEEN IN AGAIN THANK THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WITH THAT I'LL REQUEST THAT I ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ANYBODY OPPOSED.

HI MY NAME IS ALEX BRING THEM FROM FRONT WATER AUTHORITY -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS TO TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BENEFITS THAT WE PROJECT THAT THIS BILL COULD POTENTIALLY BRING FOR WATER SUPPLY FLOOD RISK AND ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION THE STATE -- SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A PRETTY BIG NUMBER THAT SEND THAT BILL AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT A COUPLE OF THINGS. SO BASED ON AS AN EXAMPLE BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES WE HAVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN BASIN WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT FIFTEEN TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN WATER SUPPLY SAVINGS PER YEAR -- EXTRAPOLATED TO THE ENTIRE ENTIRE SNOW COVERED AREAS OF THIS BILL LOOKS AT THAT COULD BE AS MUCH AS THREE HUNDRED TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR SOLELY ON WATER SUPPLY BENEFITS THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE HIGHER POWER. OR ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION OF FLOOD RISK REDUCTION -- ON THE ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION SIDE WERE NOTICING IN THE FOR EACH ADDITIONAL ECOSYSTEM FLOWS FOR SALMON RESTORATION OF THE RIVER WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT ONE POINT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR MILLION. DOLLARS IN SAVINGS PRAYER FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL FLOWS SO WE THINK THERE'S A PRETTY BIG VALUE HERE ON THE FLOOD RISK SIDE IT'S HARD TO ESTIMATE EXACTLY WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE BUT THERE'S MILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN -- DAMAGES THAT COULD HAPPEN ANY THE WATERSHED CENTER -- AT THE WITHIN THE SNOW COVERED AREA SURVEYS AS WELL SO WE THINK THERE'S A HIGH VALUE EVEN THOUGH THAT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IS IS QUITE A LARGE NUMBER SO.

DOCTOR PAN WILL GO RIGHT TO YOUR SB THREE FORTY THREE WHICH IS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION -- ON HEALTH CARE DATA DISCLOSURE AND THANK YOU FOR WAIVING PRESENTATION ON THIS BEFORE FOUR ZERO SO GOING TO THREE FORTY THREE YES. THANK YOU -- CHAIR MEMBERS -- SP FOUR THREE FORTY THREE REMOVES PROVISIONS IN THE LAW THAT ALLOWS KAISER PERMANENTE A TO REPORT LESS INFORMATION TO REGULATORS THAN OTHER HEALTH PLANS AND HOSPITALS. TRANSPARENCY LAWS LIKE RATE REVIEW IN HOSPITAL FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WERE CREATED TO HELP PURCHASERS AND REGULATORS SMOSH ACOSTA DRIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM RATES. WITH KAISER REPRESENTING ONE IN TEN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS MORE AND 40% OF INSURED CALIFORNIANS WITH COMMERCIAL COVERAGE. THIS INFORMATION GAP MEANS THAT STATE REGULATORS AND THE PUBLIC COLLECT DATA ON A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKET. AS HEALTHCARE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE POLICYMAKERS PURCHASERS AND CONSUMERS HE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT IS DRIVING COST INCREASES ACROSS ALL HEALTH PLANS INCLUDING KAISER'S THEY HAVE WITH EVERY OTHER HOSPITAL HEALTH PLAN ESPECIALLY ASKED WHEN I VOTE OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BUT THIS IS PLACE GOOD MORNING TERRY MEMBERS MICHELLE CAPITA WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION AND BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD BRING KAISER INTO COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY TO ALL OTHER HOSPITALS AND HEALTH PLANS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A MEANINGFUL POLICY IMPACT A VERY MINIMAL STATE COSTS BOTH ASHTON AND DEMI TO SEE ARE FEW SUPPORTED. AND DAMAGE THE ALREADY GETS AN ANNUAL RATE FILING FROM. KAISER RELATED TO IN THEIR INSURANCE A LARGE GROUP -- INSURANCE RATES -- FOR US FOR THE STATE ALREADY GETS HEALTH FACILITY DATA FROM KAISER AND BY FACILITY ON UTILIZATION AND THIS WOULD SIMPLY ADD THE FINANCIAL DATA TO THOSE. ELEMENTS -- AS THE ALL OTHER HOSPITALS PROVIDE -- WE FURTHER BELIEVE THAT KAISER WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THESE -- PROVISIONS WITH MINIMAL ADDITIONAL COST TO THE SYSTEM. AFTER THE ACA A AND THE COMPLIANCE -- PROVISIONS IN FEDERAL LAW OUR OWN WORKERS WHO PROCESS CLAIMS WITHIN KAISER SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INTERNAL SEA CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE VOLUME AND THE DETAIL OF DATA THAT KAISER COLLECTS. ABOUT EACH OF THE VISITS -- KAISER NOW CREATES WHAT ARE CALLED ENCOUNTER AND CLAIMS DATA FOR EVERYONE AND THIS WOULD MAKE POSSIBLE NOT ONLY COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS REQUIRED UNDER THIS BILL. BUT ALSO -- DEVELOPMENT OF IT HAS ALSO FACILITATED KAISER'S DEVELOPMENT OF NEW HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLAN OFFERINGS SO -- WITH THIS MEANS IS THAT UNLESS KAISER WAS TRACKING THE STATE OF FIVE FACILITY BY PROCEDURE INTERNALLY THEY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY EXPAND THAT LINE OF BUSINESS -- IT IS FOR ALL THOSE REASONS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT KAISER CAN COMPLY AT MINIMAL COST TO BOOK HEISER AND TO THE STATE. AND OVER TIME AS KAISER IS COMPELLED TO PROVIDE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON COST DRIVERS WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO DRIVE DOWN HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS IN COSTS FOR ALL -- INCLUDING THE PUBLIC PURCHASERS MCKAY CONSUMERS WHO USE KISER FOR THOSE REASONS WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT OTHER WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YES MEAN CODE FOR HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. THREE FORTY THREE MEMBERS HEALTH ACCESS WAS THE SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL RATE REVIEW LEGISLATION WHICH SB THREE FORTY THREE A MAN'S. THE RATE REVIEW LAW REQUIRES HEALTH PLANS TO SAY HOW MUCH THEY SPENT ON TEN CATEGORIES PHYSICIAN SERVICES INPATIENT HOSPITAL CARE OUTPATIENT EMERGENCY CARE LAB. AND IMAGING IN OUR VIEW BECAUSE OUR HAS IGNORED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LAW AND THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION LET THEM GET AWAY WITH IT. MEMBERS HOW DOES KAISER KNOW HOW MUCH POSITION SERVICES COST SEPARATED OUT FROM HOSPITAL SERVICES DO THEY HAVE A BUDGET FOR THE COMPANY THAT SEPARATES LAB SERVICES FROM X. RAYS AND CAT SCANS AND MRI AND OTHER IMAGING COSTS. HOW ARE THEY PROVIDING CARE TO ALMOST NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS IF THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS COMPARED TO HOSPITALS? IN THE RATE FILINGS KAISER SAYS THEY CANNOT PUBLICLY EXPLAIN WHAT THEY SPEND ON DOCTORS HOSPITALS LABORATORIES AND IMAGING. AND THEY POINT TO THE SENTENCE THAT SB THREE FORTY THREE DELETE AS THE REASON THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM. TO THAT IS NOT WHAT THE SENTENCE SAYS IT IS NOT WHAT IT MEANT THE FAILURE OF THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION TO ENFORCE THE LAW AS WRITTEN IS NO EXCUSE. KAISER IS A MAJOR PART OF OUR HEALTH SYSTEM YET THEY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME REVIEW AS OTHER HEALTH PLANS THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE CANNOT DETERMINE WHETHER KAISER'S RATES ARE REASONABLE OR JUSTIFIED. BECAUSE KAISER REFUSES TO PRODUCE THE INFORMATION THE LAW REQUIRES THERE'S NO FISCAL IMPACT TO DAMAGE THE BECAUSE THEY ALREADY HAVE THE STAFF TO UNDERTAKE THIS REVIEW AND SB THREE FORTY THREE WILL MAKE THEM COMPLY WITH CURRENT LAW. THERE'S MINIMAL COST TO OFSHE PAD AND ALL COSTS OR FEES SUPPORTED SPECIAL FUND FOR THESE REASONS HEALTH ACCESS PORTS SB THREE FORTY THREE AND REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE KEEP IT TO A ME. TOO OUR JEFFREY TAYLOR KAISER EMPLOYEE AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. LIZ GRIGSBY A KAISER EMPLOYEE AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.

CHINESE WISDOM KAISER EMPLOYEE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. CAP CARRILLO SOUTH SACRAMENTO SENIOR CITIZENS ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. STEVE YOU LAWYER AYE KAISER CUSTOMER DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT IS THERE OPPOSITION. BY COME TO THE TABLE SOMEBODY. THERE'S A SEAT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TREES A STARK WITH KAISER PERMANENTE A WE ARE -- WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THIS BILL AND FORTUNATELY -- WE THINK IT'S UNNECESSARY -- AND AND WASTEFUL AND AND RATHER PUNITIVE SINCE AS YOU'VE HEARD IT ONLY IMPACTS KAISER PERMANENTE A I WILL LIMIT MY COMMENTS -- TO THE FISCAL ON THE BILL BUT I DO WANT TO CORRECT THE RECORD THE KAISER PERMANENTE IS FULLY COMPLIANT WITH CURRENT LAW. FULLY GOES THROUGH THE RATE REVIEW -- PROCESS OVER IT DAM H. C. AND SENDS ALL REQUIRED REPORTS TO OUR SPOT SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT -- I THINK THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY -- DEMONSTRATES A REAL LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF HOW KAISER PERMANENTE IS DIFFERENT AND OUR INTEGRATED MODEL AND HOW WE ARE DIFFERENT FROM. OTHER STANDALONE -- HEALTH PLANS-AND HOSPITALS AND AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE ALL VERY FOCUSED ON LOWERING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND IMPROVING QUALITY AND ACCESS. OF THIS BILL AT DOESN'T DO ANY OF THAT SO WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT COME. WITH RESPECT -- TO COST -- AT THIS BILL WILL COST KAISER PERMANENTE MEANT MONEY TO IMPLEMENT AND IT WILL COST THE STATE MONEY TO IMPLEMENT AND ACTUALLY -- ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY COST OTHER HOSPITALS MONEY SINCE AS THE SPONSORS POINTED OUT -- OFSHE BUT IS A IS A FEW SUPPORTED -- AGENCIES SO WE WOULD RATHER BE SPENDING THOSE RESOURCES ON PATIENT CARE AND OUR EMPLOYEES -- RATHER THAN THIS RATHER WASTEFUL -- ADMINISTRATIVE EXERCISE -- HOWEVER SO HAVING SAID THAT WE DO VALUE TRANSPARENCY WE UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT AN IMPORTANT TOOL -- IN OUR OVERALL EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THAT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM SO WE ARE -- WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE AUTHOR ABOUT -- WAYS THAT KAISER PERMANENTE CAN BE MORE TRANSPARENT WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM WE ARE. HOPING TO HAVE A CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE SPONSOR -- IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE AND TO HOPEFULLY HAVE SOME AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE THERE ARE THINGS THAT MAYBE WE CAN DO TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION AND AND BE MORE TRANSPARENT --WE HOPE TO HAVE THOSE AMENDMENTS DISCUSSED -- BUT FOR THE BILL IS TAKEN UP ON THE SENATE FLOOR IN NEW SENATOR PAN HAS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US ON THAT. AND THERE WERE SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SENATE HEALTH COMMITTEE THAT ALSO INDICATED A DESIRE TO A CD OFF THEIR WORK WITH US SO WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT -- THAT CAN HAPPEN VERY SOON THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION FINANCE. NO FILE -- FILE. DOCTOR PAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ANY QUESTIONS NO QUESTION OF PAIN WHICH LIKE TO CLOSE IN A I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE. COMMITTED TO HAVE CONVERSATION WORK WITH KAISER AS THIS PROGRESSES. YES AND SO WE WANT TO CERTAINLY WORK KAISER ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT -- TRANSPARENCY ENSURING THAT THE REGULATORS AND THE PUBLIC HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THEY NEED -- TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT -- WE HAVE A COST EFFECTIVE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND ESPECIALLY AS PRIVATE. THANK YOU THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS IS THURMOND EMOTION. I HAVE A MOTION PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PORTANTINO AYE PORTANTINO AYE BATES. BATES NO BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE HILL.

MORNING CHAIRMAN PORTANTINO AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- WE WANT TO THANK SENATOR STERN -- HERTZBERG ALLEN FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND BEING SO SUPPORTIVE OF THE ARTS -- WE ALSO WANNA THANK YOU CHAIRMAN PORTANTINO FOR PRESENTING INTO HUNGER YOUR OWN POETRY. AT THE CALIFORNIA POET LAUREATE AND MOUNTED ME I DID. SORRY ABOUT THAT -- BUT WE KNOW THAT YOU ARE ALREADY AWARE THAT -- READING AND WRITING POETRY IS A MEANS OF PASSING ON STORIES AND CREATING AND DISCOVERING PEOPLE AND PLACES AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL -- WILL ENHANCE THAT OPPORTUNITY POETRY FUELS CHILDREN'S VOCABULARY AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN THE LITERARY ARTS AND THAT'S AN ART FORM IT'S OFTEN LOST IN TODAY'S REALLY BUSY WORLD. THE CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL WAS INSPIRED TO BRING THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF OUR PROGRAM POETRY OUT LOUD WHICH MANY OF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN. AND WE REACH OVER FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THIS NATIONAL RECITATION CONTEST WHERE STUDENTS ARE RECITING EVERYTHING FROM PRE TWENTIETH CENTURY TO CURRENT DAY POETRY. AND THIS PROGRAM HAS REALLY SHOWED HOW THIS INTEREST IN -- POETRY AT AS HAS GROWN THROUGHOUT OUR STATE AND THERE ARE SO MANY SO MANY. YOUNG STUDENTS WHO ARE REALLY INTERESTED AGES THIRTEEN THROUGH NINETEEN AND WRITING THEIR OWN POETRY. SO WE BELIEVE THAT HONORING A YOUTH POET AS CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH POET LAUREATE WILL INSPIRE THESE YOUNG ADULTS. TO HAVE A VOICE AND TO REALLY ENSURE THAT POETRY IS PASSED ON TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA ARTS COUNCIL THAT DIVERSITY IS OUR STRENGTH AND THAT'S REALLY. THE REASON FOR HAVING THIS STATE AND BECAUSE WE WANT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL TO PARTICIPATE ON WE DON'T WANT STATUS OR GEOGRAPHY TO STAND IN THE WAY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE APPOINTMENT OF A YOUTH POET LAUREATE BY THE GOVERNOR WILL GIVE YOU POSTED OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC SERVICE DISAPPOINTMENT WILL GET THE STATE OUT ALSO A VALUABLE WAY TO IDENTIFY GOVERNMENT LEADERS. AND WRITERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO SPECIFIC A COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
