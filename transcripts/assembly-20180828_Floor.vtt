01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:39.414
TO GRAPPLE WITH THAT UNFORGIVING

01:18:39.481 --> 01:18:42.451
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE

01:18:42.517 --> 01:18:43.885
WE NEED TO TAKE STEPS TO FURTHER

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:47.055
SLOW THE CRISIS A METER. TWENTY

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:48.023
THIRTY CLIMATE GOALS A

01:18:48.090 --> 01:18:49.091
CENTERPIECE OF OUR CLIMATE

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:50.459
STRATEGIES HAS BEEN CLEANING UP

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:51.860
OUR ELECTRICAL GRID.

01:18:51.927 --> 01:18:53.095
WELL THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.530
PUSHING CALL A SUPER POLLUTANTS

01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:57.399
THAT'S NO LONGER COST EFFECTIVE.

01:18:57.466 --> 01:18:58.934
CALIFORNIA DECIDED YEARS AGO TO

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:00.635
SLOWLY AND STEADILY REDUCE OUR

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:02.437
DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS TO

01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:04.806
POWER OUR ECONOMY.

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.108
EVERY TIME CALIFORNIA HAS SET A

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.642
TARGET FOR CLEAN RENEWABLE

01:19:07.709 --> 01:19:09.177
ENERGY WE HAVE BLOWN RIGHT

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:11.379
THROUGH THAT TARGET. THREE YEARS

01:19:11.446 --> 01:19:13.548
AGO WE SET OUR PS SCHOOLS AT 50%

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:16.017
BY TWENTY THIRTY AT THAT TIME WE

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.653
THOUGHT GOING FROM 33%.

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:21.389
BY 202250% BY TWENTY THIRTY WITH

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:24.159
AMBITIOUS BUT WE WERE WRONG.

01:19:24.226 --> 01:19:25.861
THE FACT IS THAT MANY ENERGY

01:19:25.927 --> 01:19:27.162
RETAILERS ARE ALREADY NEARING

01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:29.965
THAT 50% RENEWABLE ENERGY A FULL

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.900
DECADE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.068
GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF THIS

01:19:33.135 --> 01:19:34.202
PROGRAM WE NEED TO KEEP GOING IN

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:35.637
AIM HIGHER.

01:19:35.704 --> 01:19:37.105
S. B. ONE HUNDRED BILLS ON

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.274
SIXTEEN YEARS OF SUCCESS AND PUT

01:19:39.341 --> 01:19:41.309
CALIFORNIA PASSED A 100% CLEAN

01:19:41.376 --> 01:19:44.379
AND RENEWABLE ENERGY BY.

01:19:44.446 --> 01:19:44.980
TWENTY FORTY FIVE SPECIFICALLY

01:19:45.046 --> 01:19:46.281
THIS BILL WOULD ACCELERATE OUR

01:19:46.348 --> 01:19:50.252
CURRENT 50% TARGET FROM TWENTY

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:50.886
THIRTY TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX IN I

01:19:50.952 --> 01:19:51.653
WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW RPF

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:52.954
BENCHMARK BY.

01:19:53.021 --> 01:19:56.224
AB 60% BY.

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.025
TWENTY THIRTY THIS MEASURE WOULD

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.193
THEN CREATE A PLANNING GOAL

01:19:58.260 --> 01:20:00.028
PUTTING CALIFORNIA PATH TO REACH

01:20:00.095 --> 01:20:03.064
A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY BY

01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:03.598
TWENTY FORTY FIVE USING A

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.400
TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL STANDARD

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.269
WHICH MEANS WE ARE EXCLUDING.

01:20:07.335 --> 01:20:08.136
CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL

01:20:08.203 --> 01:20:09.571
HYDROELECTRIC CAPACITY THAT WE

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.873
ALREADY HAVE.

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.942
THERE'S ALSO A FINAL 40%

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.310
PLANNING GOAL THAT STATES THAT

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:16.778
THE PLAN TO REACH A 100% MUST BE

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:18.113
ACCOMPLISHED IN A MATTER THE

01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.581
PROTECT THE RELIABILITY OF THE

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:20.482
GRID.

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.117
IT WOULD NOT RESULT IN ANY AND

01:20:22.184 --> 01:20:23.685
REASONABLE PRICE INCREASES ON

01:20:23.752 --> 01:20:25.353
RATEPAYERS.

01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.055
THE 40% GOAL CONTAINS NO

01:20:27.122 --> 01:20:29.357
MANDATES AND NO PENALTIES BUT

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:30.425
DIRECTLY ADMINISTRATION TO

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.626
DESIGN A PLAN THAT WOULD REACH

01:20:31.693 --> 01:20:33.228
THAT GOAL.

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.163
ONCE THE ADMINISTRATION DESIGNS

01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:37.365
THAT PLAN IT HAVE TO BE BROUGHT

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.100
BACK TO FUTURE LEGISLATURE SO

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:40.669
THOSE FOLKS WHO HAVE SAID TO YOU

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:43.104
DO NOT GIVE AWAY YOUR POWER.

01:20:43.171 --> 01:20:44.873
IT COMES BACK HERE.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:46.174
WHILE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:47.375
IS BUSY ATTACKING THE LUNGS OF

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:49.711
ALL AMERICANS CALIFORNIA CAN AND

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.079
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD.

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:53.915
GETTING RID OF ALL DIRTY ENERGY.

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:55.917
CLEAN ENERGY IS A PILLAR OF OUR

01:20:55.984 --> 01:20:57.919
ECONOMY AND IT'S HERE TO STAY.

01:20:57.986 --> 01:20:59.421
I HOPE WILL LEAD THE WAY TODAY

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:01.022
THIS IS OUR CHANCE NOT ONLY TO

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:02.524
LEAD THE WORLD IN FIGHTING

01:21:02.591 --> 01:21:03.558
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT TO STRENGTHEN

01:21:03.625 --> 01:21:04.793
OUR MIDDLE CLASS FOR DECADES TO

01:21:04.859 --> 01:21:06.294
COME WITH QUALITY JOBS.

01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:07.229
THAT CAN SUPPORT FAMILIES AND

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:09.164
LIFT UP COMMUNITIES.

01:21:09.231 --> 01:21:10.765
PASSING SB ONE HUNDRED SAY IT'S

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.400
NOT ONLY POSSIBLE IT'S CRITICAL.

01:21:12.467 --> 01:21:17.138
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.406

TO A 100% RENEWABLES LIED SAW

01:21:25.947 --> 01:21:28.450
AND GET RID OF THE CAP ON OUR

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.585
HYDROELECTRIC DAM SO WE CAN GET

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.220
UP 290% TODAY.

01:21:32.287 --> 01:21:34.256
THIS BILL FAILS TO DO THAT.

01:21:34.322 --> 01:21:35.390
THIS BILL DOESN'T HELP JUMPSTART

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:38.393
THINGS LIKE BIOMASS.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.229
IT'S NOT A 100% THERE.

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:42.998
WE TALK ABOUT LET'S NOT PASS

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.633

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:53.642
WITH AN INCREASE IN THEIR

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:56.211
ELECTRIC BILLS EVERY YEAR AS

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:58.546
WE'VE TRIED TO ACHIEVE THIS.

01:21:58.613 --> 01:22:01.149
IF WE TRULY.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.217
HONEST TO GOD WHEN HE GETS A

GET RID OF THE CAP ON OUR HYDRO

01:22:06.921 --> 01:22:09.124
DAMS LET'S BUILD MORE DAMS IN

01:22:09.190 --> 01:22:11.026
MAKE THEM HYDRO DAMS.

01:22:11.092 --> 01:22:11.626
AND THAT'S A GREAT WAY WE CAN

01:22:11.693 --> 01:22:12.661
GET THERE.

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:13.928
BUT SO FAR WILL YOU SEEN IN THE

01:22:13.995 --> 01:22:17.465
STATE IS NO DO DAMS.

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:18.967
IN WERE NOT CHANGING THE CAPITA

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.535
HYDRO SO UNTIL THIS BILL

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:21.870
ACTUALLY DOES THAT WHICH I

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:23.138
SUGGESTED TO THE AUTHOR MONTHS

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:27.409
AGO. TO ACTUALLY GET US THERE.

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:29.411
IT IS NOT A 100% THEIR MEMBERS I

01:22:29.477 --> 01:22:31.179
ASK YOU FOR NO VOTE LET'S GET

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:32.280

IF CALIFORNIA WANTS TO BE A 100%

01:22:34.282 --> 01:22:35.317
LET'S DO IT THROUGHHYDRO.

01:22:35.383 --> 01:22:37.085

01:22:52.067 --> 01:22:54.035
THERE IS.

01:22:54.102 --> 01:22:57.172
NO OTHER ISSUE BUT CLIMATE.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.440
THERE IS NO OTHER ISSUE BUT

01:22:58.506 --> 01:23:01.643
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:03.311
CLIMATE CHANGE POSES AN

01:23:03.378 --> 01:23:06.181
EXISTENTIAL THREAT. TO OUR

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:08.750
PLANET.

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:09.684
THE ONLY THING THAT THE

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:12.020
SCIENTISTS GOT WRONG.

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:14.289
WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE?

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:15.357
WAS THE RATE AT WHICH IT IS

01:23:15.423 --> 01:23:17.359
OCCURRING.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:18.727
IT'S OCCURRING FASTER THAN

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.662
PROJECTIONS.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.764
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING. TO TWENTY

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.833
OR THIRTY YEARS AGO.

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:25.834
CLIMATE CHANGE WAS FIRST

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.036
DISCUSSED.

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:29.871
IN THE PRESS AND IN SCIENTIFIC

01:23:29.938 --> 01:23:31.139
JOURNALS AT THE TURN OF THE

01:23:31.206 --> 01:23:32.974
TWENTIETH CENTURY.

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:34.676
EVEN THEN THE AMOUNT OF COAL

01:23:34.743 --> 01:23:35.577
THAT.

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.545
COAL THAT WAS BEING PUT INTO THE

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:39.581
ATMOSPHERE WAS BEGINNING TO WARM

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.415
THE PLANET.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.384
AND SCIENTISTS WERE DISCUSSING.

01:23:42.450 --> 01:23:44.486
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

01:23:44.552 --> 01:23:45.420
IF THOSE CARBON EMISSIONS

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:47.255
CONTINUE.

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.723
WE ARE SEEING [inaudible]

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:50.291
FAMINE [inaudible]

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:51.593
WAR [inaudible]

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.361
DISRUPTION [inaudible]

01:23:53.428 --> 01:23:56.931
REFUGEES DISEASE ALL DIRECTLY

01:23:56.998 --> 01:23:58.933
RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE ALL

OVER THE PLANET.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.571
I DON'T NO WHAT IT IS ABOUT THE

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:05.340
ENORMITY OF THIS ISSUE THAT

01:24:05.407 --> 01:24:08.143
MAKES IT DIFFICULTFOR PEOPLE.

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:10.812
TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE.

01:24:10.879 --> 01:24:13.281
THE THREAT IS SO GRAVE.

01:24:13.348 --> 01:24:14.449
THAT WE CAN'T WRAPPER ON OUR

01:24:14.516 --> 01:24:18.119
MINDS AROUND IT.

01:24:18.186 --> 01:24:19.988
IT'S SO OVERWHELMING THAT IT

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:22.690
LEADS TO A KIND OF PARALYSIS.

01:24:22.757 --> 01:24:23.691
THAT LEADS TO PEOPLE TALKING

01:24:23.758 --> 01:24:26.661
ABOUT.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.363
WHY WE SHOULDN'T DO WHATEVER WE

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:31.166
CAN?

01:24:31.232 --> 01:24:32.967
BECAUSE A BILL MAYBE ISN'T AS

01:24:33.034 --> 01:24:35.069
PERFECT OR EXACTLY AS WE WERE AS

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.971
SOMEONE WOULD LIKE.

01:24:37.038 --> 01:24:38.039
I THINK THIS IS THE MOST

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.474
IMPORTANT BILLS THAT WE ARE

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:42.577

ONE HUNDRED AND LET ME TELL YOU

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.183
ANOTHER REASON THIS IS SO

01:24:48.249 --> 01:24:49.684
IMPORTANT EVEN KNOW CALIFORNIA

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.519
ONLY REPRESENTS A SMALL PORTION

01:24:51.586 --> 01:24:53.254
OF THE WORLD'S EMISSIONS.

01:24:53.321 --> 01:24:55.890
WHAT WE DO HERE IS NOTICED?

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.659
BY THE ENTIRE WORLD.

01:24:57.725 --> 01:24:59.494
WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.629
ON THE BILL ON THE PLANET.

01:25:01.696 --> 01:25:03.364
AND WE SET THE TONE.

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:04.666
EVEN IF THE UNITED STATES

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:07.168
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS ABSCONDED.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:09.070
ITS ROLE AS A WORLD LEADER ON SO

01:25:09.137 --> 01:25:11.539
MANY ISSUES WE IN CALIFORNIA CAN

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:13.074

IS.

01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.503
WE KNOW WHAT THE SCIENCES THE

01:31:49.570 --> 01:31:51.505
SCIENCE A MATTER WHERE YOU STAND

01:31:51.572 --> 01:31:52.506
ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM DOES

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:54.175
NOT CHANGE.

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.110
LAST WEEK FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:58.746
EVER IN RECORDED HISTORY.

01:31:58.813 --> 01:32:02.250

01:32:02.316 --> 01:32:03.985
THE ARCTIC ICE OF FOOD THE

ARCTIC ICE NORTH OF GREENLAND

01:32:05.586 --> 01:32:07.488
BROKE APART.

01:32:07.555 --> 01:32:09.624
THIS IS NOT JUST AN EXISTENTIAL

01:32:09.690 --> 01:32:11.125
THREAT AS TO WHAT COULD HAPPEN

01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.894
OR A THEORETICAL THREAT.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.328
THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY AND HAS

01:32:14.395 --> 01:32:15.963
ALREADY BEEN DONE.

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:17.765
AND THE DAMAGE WILL CONTINUE TO

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:18.799
BE DONE AS LONG AS WE REFUSE TO

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.801
ACT.

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:22.136
AND SO THERE ARE NO MORE

01:32:22.203 --> 01:32:25.006
TOMORROWS LEFT WE'VE ALREADY SET

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.774
OUR FUTURE GENERATIONS ON A

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:28.943

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:32.480
THAT WE NOW MUST WORK.

01:32:32.546 --> 01:32:33.648
NO REALLY BIG ORIGINALLY TO

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:35.349

AND AS YOU ONE HUNDRED IS BOLD

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:40.488

STILL AS YOU IN THE YEARS AHEAD

01:32:42.657 --> 01:32:43.858
OF IT STILL IS NOT GONNA BE

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:45.526
SIMPLY ENOUGH WHAT IT DOES IS

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:46.761
SETS EXPECTATION.

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:49.263
IT'S AS THE MARKET EXPECTATIONS

01:32:49.330 --> 01:32:51.198
THAT ALLOWS FOR INVESTMENT TO

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.200
MOVE US IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.403
AND YES POLICIES WE ADOPT HERE

01:32:55.469 --> 01:32:57.371
DO HAVE IMPACTED DOES HAVE AN

01:32:57.438 --> 01:32:58.639

01:33:04.445 --> 01:33:05.313
WELL.

01:33:05.379 --> 01:33:07.014

01:33:07.081 --> 01:33:09.283
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO MOVE

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:11.085
US IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:12.653
WE CANNOT IGNORE NOT JUST THE

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:16.557
SCIENCE NUYS ECONOMIC VITALITY

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:19.193

TECHNOLOGY IN CLEAN ENERGY WE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:37.645
MUST GIVE THEM.

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:39.613
THAT REASON TO INVEST WE MUST

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:41.315
SET THE EXPECTATION SO THAT WE

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:43.417
CAN MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS

01:33:43.484 --> 01:33:44.585

WE DO IT.

01:35:03.664 --> 01:35:05.533
THAT MATTERS.

01:35:05.599 --> 01:35:06.801
THE RATEPAYERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:25.653
AND WE'RE PAYING TO DO THAT AND

01:35:25.719 --> 01:35:27.655
IT'S DRIVING THE COSTA.

01:35:27.721 --> 01:35:28.656
MANY REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON THE

01:35:28.722 --> 01:35:30.658

THIS IS POLICY IS NOT THE TIME

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.207
IT'S NOT PUT WELL THOUGHT OUT.

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:47.441

GOING TO TAKE AWAY FROM THE

01:35:53.547 --> 01:35:54.348
CLIMATE.

01:35:54.415 --> 01:35:55.716
THAT GOAL IS TO REDUCE CARBON IN

01:35:55.783 --> 01:35:58.886
THE ATMOSPHERE.

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:00.354

SPIRE?

01:36:05.359 --> 01:36:06.293
THIS WILL DO NOTHING TO CURB

01:36:06.360 --> 01:36:07.394
THAT CARBON.

01:36:07.461 --> 01:36:08.829
WHICH IS THE NUMBER ONE A MINUTE

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:10.598

CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD IT

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:22.076

SCIENCE WE INVEST IN THE FUTURE.

01:37:38.552 --> 01:37:40.020
AND THAT'S WHAT S. B. ONE

01:37:40.087 --> 01:37:41.355
HUNDRED IS ABOUT AND WHAT HAVE

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.390
WE GOT FOR WILL IS YOU'LL GET

01:37:43.457 --> 01:37:44.792
SIGNIFICANT DIVIDEND MEMBERS OF

THE FASTEST GROWING ECONOMY IN

01:37:46.527 --> 01:37:47.661
THE COUNTRY.

01:37:47.728 --> 01:37:49.430
WE HAVE CLEANER AIR BECAUSE OF

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:53.334
MILLION.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.769
GREEN IT GREEN CLEAN ENERGY JOBS

01:37:55.836 --> 01:37:57.071
AND THAT IS THE GROW IT'S THE

01:37:57.137 --> 01:37:59.106
FASTEST GROWING PART OF OUR JOB

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:00.808
MARKET HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:02.610
MEMBERS THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.

01:38:02.676 --> 01:38:04.378
IT WAS THE CONSCIOUS DECISION OF

01:38:04.445 --> 01:38:05.312
OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.814
LEGISLATURE TO SET US ON THIS

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.716
PATH AND NOW WE'RE BEING ASKED

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.718
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND I

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:12.119
BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD.

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:13.420
BECAUSE EXACTLY THOSE FOLKS WHO

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:14.755
SAID NO THAT WE COULD NOT DO

01:38:14.822 --> 01:38:15.856
WOULD HAVE BEEN PROVEN WRONG

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:17.658
BECAUSE THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.727
HAVE NOT PROVEN TO BE TRUE.

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:20.961
AND BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE OF

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:22.663
DOING NOTHING IS SO ABSOLUTELY

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.365
TERRIBLE.

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:25.165
BUT EXCITED ABOUT THE NUMBERS I

01:38:25.232 --> 01:38:26.867
WANT TO TALK ONLY TO HEAR FROM

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:28.302
MY OWN COMMUNITY WHEN I SERVED

01:38:28.369 --> 01:38:29.570
AS THE MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO I

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.238
INTRODUCED THE CLIMAX A PLAN TO

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.540
COMMIT SAN DIEGO TO MOVING

21100% RENEWABLE ENERGY.

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:37.344
THAT WAS IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FAST

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:39.179
FORWARD TO TODAY WORTH BY THREE

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:39.947
OF THE FIVE CITIES IN MY

01:38:40.014 --> 01:38:41.649
ASSEMBLY DISTRICT HAVE ALREADY

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:42.082
MADE THIS COMMITMENT

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.383
[inaudible]

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:44.218
BY.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:46.086
CASTING THE STATE'S A LOT IN

01:38:46.153 --> 01:38:47.221
WITH THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:49.056
THEY COULD WE CAN HELP THEM

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:49.823
ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THESE GOALS

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:50.924
THAT THEY'VE ALREADY COMMITTED

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.359
THEMSELVES.

01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:53.460
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE MARKET

01:38:53.527 --> 01:38:55.195
SIGNAL THAT WE WILL SEND A TO

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:56.764
FOLKS WHO ARE PINE NEARING THE

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:58.699
TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE

01:38:58.766 --> 01:39:00.234
TO DO THIS WORK.

01:39:00.301 --> 01:39:02.202
WE MUST PUT OURSELVES OUT THERE

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:03.270
TO DO THIS BECAUSE AS WE SEE

01:39:03.337 --> 01:39:04.605
EVERY SINGLE DAY THE

01:39:04.672 --> 01:39:06.774
CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE INACTION

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.009
ARE ALL AROUND US IT JUST IN MY

01:39:10.010 --> 01:39:10.811
WE'VE.

01:39:10.878 --> 01:39:12.279
MEASURED EIGHTY DEGREE WATER

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.186
THEM.

01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:20.821
BUT THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST THIS

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.456
HAVE NEVER BEEN PROVEN CORRECT.

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:23.524
AND THE FAX AGAINST NOT DOING IT

01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:25.459
ARE SO VERY MUCH IN OUR FACE

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:27.461
THAT WE CANNOT IGNORE.

01:43:24.097 --> 01:43:26.266
ENVIRONMENT.

01:43:26.333 --> 01:43:26.833
AND THAT WE'VE GOT TO MAKE A

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:28.502
DECISION NOW ABOUT WHAT WE ARE

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:31.071
GOING TO DO SLOW DOWN THAT CLOCK.

01:43:31.138 --> 01:43:33.874
TO PRESERVE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND

01:43:33.941 --> 01:43:34.975
FOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN AND

01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.410
FOR FUTURE.

01:43:36.476 --> 01:43:37.477
CALIFORNIANS AND IN MANY WAYS

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.413
FOR OURSELVES.

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:42.482
YES THERE IS PROBABLY SOME PRICE

01:43:42.549 --> 01:43:44.217
TO WHAT THIS MEASURE ASK.

01:43:44.284 --> 01:43:46.753
FOR BUT I'D ASK YOU THIS.

01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:48.188
WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU PUT?

01:43:48.255 --> 01:43:51.725
ON A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE.

01:43:51.792 --> 01:43:52.993
WHAT PRICE WOULD YOU PUT ON A

01:43:53.060 --> 01:43:53.794
GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE THIS BILL

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:55.896
SAYS?

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:56.530
THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING IN

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:59.833
OUR POWER [inaudible] TO PROVIDE.

01:43:59.900 --> 01:44:02.436
A GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:02.736
[inaudible]

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:05.105
ITS ASPIRATIONAL.

01:44:05.172 --> 01:44:08.075
IT IS SEEKING TO DO THE BEST.

01:44:08.141 --> 01:44:09.543
AND MAYBE WE WON'T GET THERE.

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.578
IN THE YEARS THAT HAVE BEEN SET

01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:12.980
AS TARGETS MAYBE WE WON'T GET

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:14.848
THERE AND TWENTY TWENTY SIX

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.217
MAYBE WE'LL GET THERE BY.

01:44:17.284 --> 01:44:18.485
TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHY NOT STRIVE

01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:20.621
FOUR WHAT IS THE BEST.

01:44:20.687 --> 01:44:23.123
WHEN WE KNOW THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:44:23.190 --> 01:44:24.157
A DETERIORATION IN OUR

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:25.592
ENVIRONMENT?

01:44:25.659 --> 01:44:27.094
WELL WE KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN THE

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.629
MELTING OF THE SNOW PACK WHEN WE

01:44:28.695 --> 01:44:30.030
KNOW THAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:44:30.097 --> 01:44:31.465
CHALLENGES AND OUR AIR QUALITY

01:44:31.531 --> 01:44:34.368
MORE WE KNOW THAT WE'RE FACING.

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:36.036
SEA LEVEL RISE AND OTHER

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:40.240
CHALLENGES IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.

01:44:40.307 --> 01:44:41.208
MY TWELVE YEAR OLD DAUGHTER SAYS

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:44.277
THAT SHE'S A SCIENTISTS.

01:44:44.344 --> 01:44:46.013
AND SHE OTHER ANYTHING IN

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:47.648
RESEARCH.

01:44:47.714 --> 01:44:49.850
OR ANY PUBLICATIONS BUT EVEN SHE

01:44:49.916 --> 01:44:50.417
KNOWS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.185
REAL.

01:44:52.252 --> 01:44:53.020
IF REST TO THE NOT SCIENCE AND

01:44:53.086 --> 01:44:54.821
WHAT'S BEFORE US.

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.490
IS REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE IN IF

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:58.425
YOU'RE NOT A SCIENTIST.

01:44:58.492 --> 01:45:00.127
NOT SO MY DAUGHTER IF YOU GONNA

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:01.995
BE A SCIENTIST IS TO RULES CLEAN

01:45:02.062 --> 01:45:02.596
UP AFTER YOUR EXPERIMENTS AND

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:05.832
DON'T BLOW UP OUR HOUSE.

01:45:05.899 --> 01:45:07.401
BUT SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED

01:45:07.467 --> 01:45:09.870
TO DO SOMETHING. FOR HERSELF AND

01:45:09.936 --> 01:45:11.705
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS.

01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:12.706
EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW ANY

01:45:12.773 --> 01:45:14.908
SCIENTIFIC THEORY YOU KNOW

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:16.143
COMMON SENSE AS YOU CAN SEE THAT

01:45:16.209 --> 01:45:18.545
IT'S GETTING HOTTER.

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:19.579
THE TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN MORE

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:21.415
EXTREME THAN WE'VE EVER EVER

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:22.149
SEEN.

01:45:22.215 --> 01:45:23.884
WHEN I WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL?

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.852
WE STARTED A CONSTRUCTION JOB

01:45:25.919 --> 01:45:27.788
TRAINING PROGRAM THAT FEATURED

01:45:27.854 --> 01:45:29.423
SOLAR PANEL INSTALLATION.

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:30.891
AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR

01:45:30.957 --> 01:45:32.059
BUILDING TRADES IN OUR LOCAL

01:45:32.125 --> 01:45:34.528
COMPANIES TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:35.996
TO OUR CONSUMERS.

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:37.064
AND IT BECAME THIS GREAT

01:45:37.130 --> 01:45:39.266
OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING GOOD

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.267
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO

01:45:40.333 --> 01:45:41.868
PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.503
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDEREMPLOYED. TO

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:47.074
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK IN.

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.475
I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE SAME

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.377
OPPORTUNITY FOR US THESE ARE NOT

01:45:50.444 --> 01:45:52.579
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOALS WE CAN

01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:53.280
PRESERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT.

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:54.281
AND PROMOTE CALIFORNIA'S

01:45:54.347 --> 01:45:55.882
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AT THE SAME

01:45:55.949 --> 01:45:58.251
TIME CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN

01:45:58.318 --> 01:46:00.754
RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY AROUND.

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:02.756
RENEWABLE ENERGY AROUND NEW

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.458
PATENTS WERE NEW FORMS OF CLEAN

01:46:04.524 --> 01:46:06.359
ENERGY AND THIS IS OUR

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:08.061
OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:10.464
LEAD NOT JUST THE NATION BUT THE

01:46:10.530 --> 01:46:11.732
WORLD WITH THE ACTIONS THAT WE

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:13.100
TAKE.

01:46:13.166 --> 01:46:15.102
AND WE DON'T GET THERE BY TWENTY

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:15.769
FORTY FIVE WE CAN ALWAYS DEVISE

01:46:15.836 --> 01:46:17.604
THIS BUT I ASK YOU AGAIN WHAT'S

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:18.638
THE PRICE YOU WOULD PUT.

FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND OUR

01:46:25.112 --> 01:46:26.179
CHILDREN'S CHILDREN.

01:46:26.246 --> 01:46:27.748
AND TO HAVE A QUALITY OF LIFE I

01:46:27.814 --> 01:46:28.915
RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE

ONE HUNDRED THANK YOU MS THURMAN

01:46:32.185 --> 01:46:33.320
DOCTOR QUIRK.

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:36.823
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:39.493
THANK YOU SPEAKER.

SO I HEAR A NUMBER.

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:44.064
OF CONCERNS HERE.

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.632
BUT I DON'T HEAR ANYONE DENYING

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:48.468
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:46:48.535 --> 01:46:52.839
AND THAT'S PROGRESS. ONE OF THE

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.174
ONE THING THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.176
BY PARTICULARLY THE MEMBER FROM

01:46:56.243 --> 01:46:59.246
BEAVER ARE REPUBLICAN LEADER.

01:46:59.312 --> 01:47:01.448
WHAT'S THE CONCERN ABOUT FIRES.

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:03.250
AND THAT IS IN IN THIS BILL.

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:05.685
BUT I GUESS.

01:47:05.752 --> 01:47:06.653
MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.522
WITH.

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:10.524
THE LEADER WITH THE MEMBER FOR

01:47:10.590 --> 01:47:13.660
BEAVER AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK.

01:47:13.727 --> 01:47:15.095
DO SOMETHING ABOUT FIRE AND

01:47:15.162 --> 01:47:17.030
BRING BACK THOSE BIOMASS PLANTS

01:47:17.097 --> 01:47:19.599
SO WE HAVE A PLACE TO PUT.

01:47:19.666 --> 01:47:20.767
THE DEBRIS FROM THE FOREST THAT

01:47:20.834 --> 01:47:22.469
WERE THINNING.

01:47:22.536 --> 01:47:24.137
SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT THAT'S

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:27.274
WITH THIS WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT.

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:28.942
THE OTHER THING I HEAR ABOUT IS

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:31.778
IS THIS REALLY FEASIBLE.

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:33.914
I I AM A SCIENTIST AND I KNOW

01:47:33.980 --> 01:47:35.916
HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS IT'S GOING

01:47:35.982 --> 01:47:39.719
TO BE MUCH HARDER TO GO FROM 33%.

01:47:39.786 --> 01:47:44.858
250%.

01:47:44.925 --> 01:47:45.492
TO SEVENTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED BUT

01:47:45.559 --> 01:47:47.661
THIS BILL AND I WOULDN'T SUPPORT

01:47:47.727 --> 01:47:48.895
IT IF IT WEREN'T IN HERE

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:52.933
SPECIFICALLY SAT.

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:54.034
THAT THE COMMISSION SHALL

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.236
MAINTAIN AND PROTECT THE SAFETY

01:47:56.303 --> 01:47:58.271
RELIABLE OPERATION AND BALLOTS

01:47:58.338 --> 01:48:03.109
YOU NEED THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM.

01:48:03.176 --> 01:48:04.811
THIS IS WHAT'S KNOWN AS AN OFF

01:48:04.878 --> 01:48:06.813
RAMP IF WE CAN'T HAVE RELIABLE

01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:08.014
ELECTRICITY WE'RE NOT GONNA DO

01:48:08.081 --> 01:48:09.716
THIS.

01:48:09.783 --> 01:48:11.184
AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE CAN

01:48:11.251 --> 01:48:12.085
OR NOT.

01:48:12.152 --> 01:48:13.353
BUT THIS IS A WAY TO GET US TO

01:48:13.420 --> 01:48:14.988
TRY.

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:16.223
SO THAT'S IN THEIR IN IF IT

01:48:16.289 --> 01:48:17.457
WEREN'T IN THERE I WOULD BE

01:48:17.524 --> 01:48:19.326
SUPPORTING IT.

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:21.561
THE SECOND THING.

01:48:21.628 --> 01:48:22.062
THAT'S IN THERE IS COST

01:48:22.128 --> 01:48:24.464
CONTAINMENT.

01:48:24.531 --> 01:48:26.366
AND AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T IN THERE

01:48:26.433 --> 01:48:28.602
I WOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING IT.

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:31.037
BUT IT'S IN THERE.

01:48:31.104 --> 01:48:32.405
AND PARTICULARLY IT SAYS THE

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:34.174
COMMISSION WILL LOOK AT EACH

01:48:34.241 --> 01:48:37.010
ELECTRICAL OUR UTILITY.

01:48:37.077 --> 01:48:38.879
AND IT WILL DETERMINE THAT THERE

01:48:38.945 --> 01:48:40.046
SHALL NOT BE DISPROPORTIONATE

01:48:40.113 --> 01:48:41.281
INCREASES [inaudible]

01:48:41.348 --> 01:48:42.616
IN [inaudible]

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:44.584
OUR COST [inaudible]

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:46.920
FURTHER IT TALKS ABOUT THE

01:48:46.987 --> 01:48:49.656
MINIMALIST CHANGES IN COST LATER

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:51.992
ON AND AGAIN IF IT WEREN'T IN

01:48:52.058 --> 01:48:53.526
THERE I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE.

01:48:53.593 --> 01:48:55.395
SO THIS IS PROTECTING OUR

01:48:55.462 --> 01:48:56.529
ELECTRICAL GRID THIS IS

01:48:56.596 --> 01:48:58.465
PROTECTING [inaudible]

01:48:58.531 --> 01:49:00.200
ARE CONSUMERS [inaudible]

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:03.136
AND FURTHER.

01:49:03.203 --> 01:49:06.172
WE ARE JUST SEEN SO MANY IMPACTS

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:06.473
[inaudible]

01:49:06.539 --> 01:49:08.008
CLIMATE.

01:49:08.074 --> 01:49:09.075
THAT I CAN TELL YOU WHEN WE

01:49:09.142 --> 01:49:10.243
LOOKED AT THIS IN THE SEVENTIES

01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.945
THAT WE NOT.

01:49:12.012 --> 01:49:14.347
WE JUST DIDN'T ANTICIPATE.

01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:16.516
THE MEMBER FROM GLENDALE VERY

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:19.819
ACCURATELY SHED WE HAD NO IDEA

01:49:19.886 --> 01:49:22.589
HOW FAST THINGS WOULD CHANGE AND

01:49:22.656 --> 01:49:24.457
WE HAD NO IDEA.

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:25.191
THAT YOU COULD GET FIRE

01:49:25.258 --> 01:49:27.327
TORNADOES.

01:49:27.394 --> 01:49:29.062
AND WHY ARE WE GETTING THESE.

01:49:29.129 --> 01:49:31.064
IT'S VERY SUBTLE.

01:49:31.131 --> 01:49:32.365
BUT WHAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE

01:49:32.432 --> 01:49:33.433
BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITH

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:34.734
FIRE [inaudible]

01:49:34.801 --> 01:49:36.836
IS THAT.

01:49:36.903 --> 01:49:39.439
WHEN YOU GET GREENHOUSE WARMING?

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:41.207
WHEN YOU GET WARMING FROM

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:43.443
GREENHOUSE GASES?

01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:44.844
IF PREFERENTIALLY KEEPS THE

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.513
TEMPERATURES UP AT NIGHT MORE

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:48.214
THAN THE DAY.

01:49:48.281 --> 01:49:50.216
WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE'RE NOT

01:49:50.283 --> 01:49:52.719
GETTING A COOLER NIGHT WHEN YOU

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:54.354
GET PATRICIA WHEN YOU GET

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:54.654
[inaudible]

01:49:54.721 --> 01:49:56.122
ARE DO.

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:58.391
AND YOU GET SOME WETNESS AND THE

01:49:58.458 --> 01:50:00.293
FIREFIGHTERS USED TO SAY LOW THE

01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:01.761
FIRES GO TO BED AT NIGHT THEY

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.330
DON'T ANYMORE.

01:50:03.396 --> 01:50:04.898
AND THAT'S WHY WE SEATS UP THAT

01:50:04.965 --> 01:50:06.533
SUCH TERRIBLE --

01:50:06.599 --> 01:50:08.635

ENVIRONMENTAL CAUSE PRICES BUT A

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:53.346
PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AS WELL.

SUBSTANTIALLY.

01:51:07.327 --> 01:51:09.629

CLEANER AIR AND HEALTHIER LONGS

01:51:21.374 --> 01:51:23.576
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

01:51:23.643 --> 01:51:25.812
RIGHT NOW OUR LUNGS ARE BEING

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:27.914
THREATENED BY AIR POLLUTION.

01:51:27.981 --> 01:51:28.815
ACCORDING TO THE LUNG

01:51:28.882 --> 01:51:31.051
ASSOCIATION STATE OF THE AIR OF

TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT.

01:51:32.786 --> 01:51:34.487
CALIFORNIA HAS THE DUBIOUS

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:37.357
DISTINCTION OF BEING HOME TO THE

01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:39.092
MAJORITY THE TOP TEN U. S.

01:51:39.159 --> 01:51:42.028
CITIES THE WORST.

01:51:42.095 --> 01:51:45.665
OZONE AND PARTICLE POLLUTION.

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:46.966
CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:49.202
VULNERABLE TO THE RISKS FROM

01:51:49.269 --> 01:51:51.037
POLLUTION MADE WORSE BY CLIMATE

01:51:51.104 --> 01:51:52.806
CHANGE.

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:54.441
THEIR LUNGS AND THEIR BODIES

01:51:54.507 --> 01:51:56.943
DEFENSES ARE STILL DEVELOPING.

01:51:57.010 --> 01:51:58.545
AND THEY BREED MORE AIR PER

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:01.681
POUND THAN ADULTS. FOR MANY

01:52:01.748 --> 01:52:02.982
SENIORS ARE POLLUTION CAN BE

01:52:03.049 --> 01:52:04.884
DEADLY.

01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:06.586
CLIMATE CHANGE HAS AN ESPECIALLY

01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:09.255
DANGEROUS IMPACT ON LOW IMPACT

01:52:09.322 --> 01:52:10.857
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:13.226
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

01:52:13.293 --> 01:52:14.260
THESE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:15.995
SUSCEPTIBLE TO HEALTH THREATS

01:52:16.062 --> 01:52:17.063
BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY LIVE OR

01:52:17.130 --> 01:52:18.498
WORK.

01:52:18.565 --> 01:52:20.300
INCLUDING YOUR PLACES THAT HAVE

01:52:20.366 --> 01:52:22.435
HIGHER LEVELS OF POLLUTION OR

01:52:22.502 --> 01:52:23.770
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A HARDER TIME

01:52:23.837 --> 01:52:25.972
GETTING MEDICAL CARE.

01:52:26.039 --> 01:52:27.407
LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE

01:52:27.474 --> 01:52:29.275
LIKELY TO HAVE CHRONIC DISEASES

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:31.177
LIKE ASTHMA AND FACE GREATER

01:52:31.244 --> 01:52:33.012
CHALLENGES COPING WITH EXTREME

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:35.882
WEATHER EVENTS.

01:52:35.949 --> 01:52:37.817
THE REALITY IS CLIMATE CHANGE IS

01:52:37.884 --> 01:52:39.452
ONE OF THE GREATEST PUBLIC

01:52:39.519 --> 01:52:42.655
HEALTH CHALLENGES OF OUR TIME.

01:52:42.722 --> 01:52:43.756
TO MEET THE CHALLENGE AND

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:45.725
PROVIDE OUR CHILDREN WITH A

01:52:45.792 --> 01:52:47.494
HEALTHIER FUTURE WE MUST

01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.863
TRANSFORM THE WAY WE PRODUCE AND

01:52:49.929 --> 01:52:52.098
CONSUME ENERGY.

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.533
AFTER YEARS OF INCREASING OUR

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.701
RENEWABLE ENERGY [inaudible]

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.603
TARGETS.

01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:58.404
IT'S TIME TO THINK BIG AND PUT

01:52:58.471 --> 01:53:00.573
OUR GREAT STATE ON A PATH TO ONE

01:53:00.640 --> 01:53:03.743
HUNDRED CAN PERCENT CLEAN ENERGY.

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:04.744
FOR OUR CHILDREN WHEN FOR FUTURE

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.012
GENERATIONS.

01:53:06.079 --> 01:53:09.782
AYE URGENT AYE VOTE.

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:10.817
HE WAS RESIDENTS HER OBERNOLTE.

01:53:10.884 --> 01:53:13.953
YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:15.421
MISTER SPEAKER I DON'T THINK A

01:53:15.488 --> 01:53:17.457
SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS BODY WOULD

01:53:17.524 --> 01:53:19.459
DISAGREE.

01:53:19.526 --> 01:53:20.693
WITH THE NEED TO INCREASE

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.095
RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION IN

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.429
CALIFORNIA I DON'T THINK A

01:53:23.496 --> 01:53:23.997
SINGLE MEMBER WOULD DISAGREE

01:53:24.063 --> 01:53:25.765
WITH THAT.

01:53:25.832 --> 01:53:27.000
BUT THE CONCERN THAT A LOT OF US

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:28.434
ARE RAISING.

01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:29.335
IS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A

01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:31.070
CREDIBLE PLAN FOR GETTING US

01:53:31.137 --> 01:53:33.039
FROM WHERE WE ARE. TO WHERE WE

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:35.141
WANT TO BE.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:36.109
WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN

01:53:36.176 --> 01:53:37.177
THAT STRIKES A REASONABLE

01:53:37.243 --> 01:53:39.145
BALANCE BETWEEN.

01:53:39.212 --> 01:53:40.747
THE GOAL WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE.

01:53:40.813 --> 01:53:41.681
AND THE COST OF THE IMPACTS OF

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:43.483
OUR STATE.

01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:44.918
AND UNFORTUNATELY THIS BULL THIS

01:53:44.984 --> 01:53:46.186
BILL DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO

01:53:46.252 --> 01:53:47.987
DOING THAT.

01:53:48.054 --> 01:53:49.756
BUT LET'S START BY TALKING ABOUT

01:53:49.822 --> 01:53:51.524
WHAT IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.427
US 2100% RENEWABLES.

01:53:54.494 --> 01:53:56.629
WE ALREADY OVER GENERATE FROM

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.665
RENEWABLES DURING THE DAY.

01:53:58.731 --> 01:54:00.200
AND WE UNDER GENERATE AT NIGHT

01:54:00.266 --> 01:54:02.068
GETTING 21100% WOULD REQUIRE US

01:54:02.135 --> 01:54:04.103
TO ADD AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT.

01:54:04.170 --> 01:54:05.738
OF ENERGY STORAGE AND WE HIT

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:07.740
RIGHT NOW HAVE NO PLAN ON HOW TO

01:54:07.807 --> 01:54:08.875
DO THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:10.677
IT'S POSSIBLE TO DO THAT.

01:54:10.743 --> 01:54:12.612
DON'T WE OWE IT TO CALIFORNIANS

01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:14.147
TO AT LEAST HAVE THOUGHT OUT HOW

01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:15.548
WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE.

01:54:15.615 --> 01:54:16.849
BEFORE WE WRITE THIS RULE IN

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:19.485
STONE THERE WERE TO GET 2100%.

01:54:19.552 --> 01:54:20.253
BUT I HAVE AN EVEN BIGGER

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.221
CONCERN.

01:54:21.287 --> 01:54:23.189
WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:26.092
AND MY CONCERN INVOLVES A TOPIC

01:54:26.159 --> 01:54:27.694
THAT'S BEEN RAISED BY NUMBER OF

01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:28.895
THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL IN

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:29.562
THIS DEBATE AND THAT'S

01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:33.099
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE.

01:54:33.166 --> 01:54:34.867
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE

01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:36.436
SURE THAT THE MANDATES THAT WE

01:54:36.502 --> 01:54:38.871
PASS IN THIS CHAMBER DO NOT FALL

01:54:38.938 --> 01:54:40.907
DISPROPORTIONATELY ON THE

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:42.242
PORTION OF OUR STATE THAT CAN

01:54:42.308 --> 01:54:44.277
LEAST AFFORD IT [inaudible]

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.713
AND UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THE

01:54:46.779 --> 01:54:47.347
THINGS WE DO IN THIS CHAMBER DO

01:54:47.413 --> 01:54:48.314
THAT.

01:54:48.381 --> 01:54:50.750
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE HIGHEST

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:52.285
POVERTY RATE OF ANY STATE.

01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.053
IN THE COUNTRY AND ACCORDING TO

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:55.655
US CENSUS BUREAU THE REASON FOR

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:57.190
THAT POVERTY PREDOMINANTLY IS

01:54:57.257 --> 01:54:58.524
THE HIGH COST OF LIVING HERE IN

01:54:58.591 --> 01:54:59.959
CALIFORNIA.

01:55:00.026 --> 01:55:01.761
NOW IT'S BEEN ASSERTED.

01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:03.229
BY THE PROPONENTS OF THIS BILL

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:04.764
THAT PREVIOUSLY PREVIOUS

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.599
INCREASES IN THE RENEWABLE

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:08.067
PORTFOLIO STANDARD.

01:55:08.134 --> 01:55:11.371
HAVE NOT RESULTED IN THE THE

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:13.139
CONSEQUENCES THAT THE DETRACTORS

01:55:13.206 --> 01:55:14.140
SAID I COMPLETELY DISAGREE WITH

01:55:14.207 --> 01:55:17.944
THAT. ONE OF THE PRIMARY OUR

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:19.279
CONCERNS THAT WE HAD WHEN WE

01:55:19.345 --> 01:55:20.246
RAISE THIS PORTFOLIO STANDARD

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:21.748
THE PAST.

01:55:21.814 --> 01:55:23.216
IS THAT ELECTRICITY RATES WOULD

01:55:23.283 --> 01:55:25.251
GO UP AND THEY HAVE.

01:55:25.318 --> 01:55:26.319
NO ONE CAN DISPUTE THAT THEY

01:55:26.386 --> 01:55:27.754
HAVE RIGHT NOW.

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:28.788
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IN

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:31.457
CALIFORNIA PAYS 40% MORE FOR

01:55:31.524 --> 01:55:32.058
ELECTRICITY THAN THE NATIONAL

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:33.593
AVERAGE.

01:55:33.660 --> 01:55:35.094
AND FOR INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICITY

01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:38.231
IT'S ALMOST 80% MORE.

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.999
THOSE COSTS ARE BORNE.

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:41.534
BY THE PAY MORE IN OUR STATE AND

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:43.469
EVERY TIME WE ADOPT ANOTHER

01:55:43.536 --> 01:55:45.638
MANDATE ANOTHER REGULATION THAT

01:55:45.705 --> 01:55:47.473
RAISES THE COST OF LIVING HERE.

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.709
INEVITABLY WE DRIVE A GREATER

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:50.343
PERCENTAGE OF OUR POPULATION IN

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.312
A POVERTY.

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:54.347
I WOULD SUPPORT.

01:55:54.414 --> 01:55:56.683
THE BALANCE PROPOSAL THAT HAVE A

01:55:56.749 --> 01:55:58.618
CREDIBLE PLAN FOR GETTING US

01:55:58.685 --> 01:55:59.719
2100% WITHOUT PASSING THOSE

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:00.887
COSTS ON TO CONSUMERS BUT

01:56:00.953 --> 01:56:02.855
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:56:02.922 --> 01:56:04.090
ACHIEVE THAT BALANCE I URGE A NO

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:09.395
VOTE.

01:56:09.462 --> 01:56:10.596
THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISS

FOR I THINK --

01:56:22.942 --> 01:56:24.677
MANAGEMENT POLICIES IN THIS

01:56:24.744 --> 01:56:26.679
STATE WHEN IT COMES TO THANK YOU

01:56:26.746 --> 01:56:27.847
ARE HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT

01:56:27.914 --> 01:56:29.415
THINKING WE'RE DOING THINGS THAT

01:56:29.482 --> 01:56:30.350
ARE GONNA HAVE AN IMPACT BUT

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.317
THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN ADVERSE

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:32.518
AFFECT JUST LOOK AT THE FIRES

01:56:32.585 --> 01:56:34.120
WE'VE DONE MORE EMISSIONS INTO

01:56:34.187 --> 01:56:35.021
THE AIR.

01:56:35.088 --> 01:56:36.656
THIS YEAR WITH A MILLION PLUS

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:38.291
ACRES BURNED.

01:56:38.358 --> 01:56:41.127
THROUGH POLICIES THAT YOU KNOW

01:56:41.194 --> 01:56:42.128
IN AN EFFORT TO TRY.

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.596
TO HEALTH THE ENVIRONMENT

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:45.298
ACTUALLY HEARD OF WORSE --

01:56:45.365 --> 01:56:46.999
ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY RATES ARE

01:56:47.066 --> 01:56:48.901
JUST GONNA GO UP WITH THIS

01:56:48.968 --> 01:56:50.803
LEGISLATION ONCE AGAIN --

GO BACK AND LOOK AT A LITTLE

01:57:56.803 --> 01:57:59.639
HISTORY HERE SO I THINK UP.

01:57:59.705 --> 01:58:00.640
IF YOU BACK TO THE NINETEEN

01:58:00.706 --> 01:58:01.407
NINETIES A LOT A NEW

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:02.875
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES CAME UP

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.277
WHERE.

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:06.779
WE LET TREES DIE NATURALLY --

01:58:06.846 --> 01:58:09.348
IN DECAY IN THE FOREST WE RAN

01:58:09.415 --> 01:58:10.650
THE LOGGERS OUT OF CALIFORNIA

01:58:10.716 --> 01:58:12.385
THAT USE TO OPEN UP THESE

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:13.753
FIREBREAKS FOR US.

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:15.488
AND IN THE MID NINETIES

01:58:15.555 --> 01:58:17.890
PRESIDENT CLINTON WAS --

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:18.858
ROUNDLY CRITICIZED BY THE

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:20.226
ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY FOR

01:58:20.293 --> 01:58:20.693
LETTING A FIRE BURNING

01:58:20.760 --> 01:58:22.195
YELLOWSTONE.

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:24.363
BUT I AFTER THAT FIRE FIVE YEARS

01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:25.898
LATER HE WAS PROVEN CORRECT WITH

01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:27.300
THE SOOT.

01:58:27.366 --> 01:58:28.768
AND THE FUEL IN THERE.

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:32.939
PRODUCED A NEW ROUND OF SAPLING.

01:58:33.005 --> 01:58:34.707
AND I WOULD --

01:58:34.774 --> 01:58:36.742
I WOULD SAY THAT THE FIRES AND

01:58:36.809 --> 01:58:38.177
EVERYTHING WERE HAVING RIGHT NOW

01:58:38.244 --> 01:58:39.679
IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THESE

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:40.580
FAILED POLICIES FROM THE

01:58:40.646 --> 01:58:43.683
NINETEEN NINETIES.

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:45.518
WE CAN HAVE THE BEST.

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.386
POLICY WE HAD AB THIRTY TWO

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:48.254
WE'VE INCREASED WE WANT TO

01:58:48.321 --> 01:58:49.589
INCREASE AGAIN WE CAN HAVE THE

01:58:49.655 --> 01:58:50.456
PERFECT [inaudible]

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.291
POLICY.

01:58:52.358 --> 01:58:53.493
BUT UNTIL WE GET OUR FORESTS

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.862
HEALTHY.

01:58:55.928 --> 01:58:57.997
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK BECAUSE THAT

01:58:58.064 --> 01:58:59.632
FOREST IS WHAT'S GOING TO TAKE

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:00.867
THE GASES.

01:59:00.933 --> 01:59:03.503
OUT OF THE AIR.

01:59:03.569 --> 01:59:04.103
SO WE REALLY NEED TO GET THIS

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:06.305
FIRE --

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:07.640
LEGISLATION GOING TO REALLY

01:59:07.707 --> 01:59:09.342
CHANGE THE POLICIES AND

01:59:09.408 --> 01:59:11.444
MANAGEMENT IN OUR FORESTS.

01:59:11.511 --> 01:59:12.912
BUT THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:14.146
DO IS WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY WE'VE

01:59:14.213 --> 01:59:15.548
GOT AS WAS SAID TO MUCH

01:59:15.615 --> 01:59:17.783
ELECTRICITY --

01:59:17.850 --> 01:59:19.352
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE STORAGE WE

01:59:19.418 --> 01:59:21.387
NEED TO INVEST IN STORAGE WE

01:59:21.454 --> 01:59:23.022
NEED TO INVEST IN BIOMASS.

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:24.857
I HAD A NUCLEAR PLANTS SANTA NOW

01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:26.392
FOR CLOSE A DIABLO CANYON

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:27.994
CLOSING THE TWENTY TWENTY SIX

01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:29.829
CLEAN NUCLEAR IS GOING TO BE

01:59:29.896 --> 01:59:30.863
GONE FROM CALIFORNIA WE NEED

01:59:30.930 --> 01:59:31.430
THAT.

01:59:31.497 --> 01:59:34.100
NOT RELIANT JUST SOLAR AND WIND

01:59:34.166 --> 01:59:36.102
AND THE COOL KIDS THEY GET THE

01:59:36.168 --> 01:59:38.304
SUBSIDIES BUT WE REALLY NEED TO

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:40.273
INVEST IN BIOMASS IN SOME OF

01:59:40.339 --> 01:59:40.907
THESE OTHER ENERGIES TO HELP US

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:43.209
OUT.

01:59:43.276 --> 01:59:44.977
AND ONE FACT IT.

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.879
YOU CANNOT DISPUTE IS THAT THIS

01:59:46.946 --> 01:59:49.048
DOES INCREASE COST THIS ENTIRE

01:59:49.115 --> 01:59:50.683
MONTH I'D BE GETTING CALLS IN MY

01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:52.151
DISTRICT OFFICE.

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:53.819
FROM RAT RESIDENTS IN THE

01:59:53.886 --> 01:59:55.721
SEVENTY THIRD DISTRICT --

01:59:55.788 --> 01:59:56.822
PARTICULARLY PLACES LIKE LADERA

01:59:56.889 --> 02:00:00.026
RANCH WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING

02:00:00.092 --> 02:00:01.294
ELEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR A MONTH

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:01.594
[inaudible]

02:00:01.661 --> 02:00:03.429
ELECTRIC BILLS.

02:00:03.496 --> 02:00:06.465
SO THE COST YOU CANNOT DISPUTE.

02:00:06.532 --> 02:00:08.000
THAT THIS IS GONNA BE PASSED ON

02:00:08.067 --> 02:00:09.535
TO THE RATE PAYERS --

02:00:09.602 --> 02:00:11.971
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:13.039
ANOTHER THING WE TALK ABOUT

02:00:13.105 --> 02:00:15.041
BEING THE WORLD'S LEADER.

02:00:15.107 --> 02:00:16.108
WELL WE ARE THE WORLD LEADER

02:00:16.175 --> 02:00:17.443
BECAUSE NO ONE ELSE IN THE WORLD

02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:19.312
IS DOING ANYTHING CHINA INDIA

02:00:19.378 --> 02:00:21.213
THESE OTHER MATTERS.

02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.115
ARE THE WILD WILD WEST WHILE WE

02:00:23.182 --> 02:00:25.151
PENALIZE OUR OWN COMPANIES WHO

02:00:25.217 --> 02:00:27.320
ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING.

02:00:27.386 --> 02:00:28.421
SO CHINA AND INDIA CAN

02:00:28.487 --> 02:00:30.189
MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS IN GOODS

02:00:30.256 --> 02:00:31.624
AND SERVICES AND SELLING CHEAPER

02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:33.059
THAN OUR CALIFORNIA AND U. S.

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.794
COMPANIES.

02:00:34.860 --> 02:00:36.162
AND I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA

02:00:36.228 --> 02:00:37.430
RATEPAYERS SHOULD FOOT THE BILL

02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.731
FOR THE REST OF WORLD SO LAST

02:00:38.798 --> 02:00:40.933
FOR NO VOTE.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:44.370
DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:45.137
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.973

02:00:48.774 --> 02:00:49.375
ONE HUNDRED BUT I WANT TO POINT

02:00:49.442 --> 02:00:51.210
OUT SOME SOME THINGS THAT HAVE

02:00:51.277 --> 02:00:52.244
BEEN POINT OUT BY A LOT OF

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:54.847
PEOPLE HERE TODAY --

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:56.682
IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE WE HAVE

02:00:56.749 --> 02:00:58.684
BIOMASS WHICH I KNOW TO SOME

02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:01.020
PEOPLE IS A IS A PROBLEM.

02:01:01.087 --> 02:01:02.722
WE HAVE AYE GEOTHERMAL ENERGY

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:03.022
[inaudible]

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:05.958
WHICH DOESN'T GET ENJOYED SOME

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:08.294
THE SUBSIDIES THAT THAT WE SEE

02:01:08.361 --> 02:01:10.029
WITH WIND AND SOLAR.

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:12.098
BUT THOSE TWO ENERGY SOURCES

02:01:12.164 --> 02:01:13.766
PROVIDE BASELINE ENERGY THEY

02:01:13.833 --> 02:01:16.402
DON'T REQUIRED SUN THEY DON'T

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:18.237
REQUIRE THE WIND AND THEY'RE

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:19.672
THERE ALL THE TIME.

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:21.874
ANY OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE.

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:23.609
BUT THEY ARE PART OF THE ENTIRE

02:01:23.676 --> 02:01:25.311
PORTFOLIO AND I THINK WE NEED TO

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.113
CONTINUE TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THAT

02:01:27.179 --> 02:01:30.082
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:31.550
I ALSO HAVE REPRESENT A

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.319
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE UP A

02:01:33.386 --> 02:01:35.121
PUBLIC UTILITY THE NORTHERN

02:01:35.187 --> 02:01:36.355
CALIFORNIA POWER AUTHORITY AND

02:01:36.422 --> 02:01:37.957
POWER AGENCY.

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:40.059
AND THEY HAVE.

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:42.294
LARGE LARGE GEOTHERMAL I'M NOT I

02:01:42.361 --> 02:01:43.029
MEAN EXCUSE ME LARGE A LARGE

02:01:43.095 --> 02:01:44.163
HYDRO.

02:01:44.230 --> 02:01:46.198
THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNTED.

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.700
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT BOAT

02:01:47.767 --> 02:01:49.568
SAILED ALONG TIME AGO --

02:01:49.635 --> 02:01:51.337
BUT AS A AS A CITY COUNCIL

02:01:51.404 --> 02:01:53.172
MEMBERS SITTING HEALDSBURG IF WE

02:01:53.239 --> 02:01:53.739
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COUNT OUR

02:01:53.806 --> 02:01:55.107
LARGE HYDRO.

02:01:55.174 --> 02:01:56.242
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT US IN

02:01:56.308 --> 02:01:59.945
THE PROBABLY 64% RENEWABLE --

02:02:00.012 --> 02:02:01.814
AND THAT WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

02:02:01.881 --> 02:02:03.416
SO THAT THAT THAT SALE BY GET IT

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:04.684
AND AND WORK AND I'M I CAN LIVE

02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:07.186
WITH THAT --

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:08.487
I GREW UP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

02:02:08.554 --> 02:02:09.889
I EXPERIENCED THAT POOR AIR

02:02:09.955 --> 02:02:12.091
QUALITY OF AIR POLLUTION IN PART

02:02:12.158 --> 02:02:13.826
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS AND I I GET

02:02:13.893 --> 02:02:14.493
THAT.

02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:16.195
I MOVED OUT OF THEIR TO THE

02:02:16.262 --> 02:02:18.464
CLEAN AIR OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:18.964
WHY CLEAN AIR NORTHERN

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:20.366
CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW IS PRETTY

02:02:20.433 --> 02:02:22.401
AWFUL?

02:02:22.468 --> 02:02:23.769
WE'VE BEEN STUCK IN SMOKE FOR

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:25.938
THE LAST THIRTY PLUS DAYS.

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:28.074
A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY NINE

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.075
THOUSAND ACRE FOREST FIRE

02:02:29.141 --> 02:02:30.776
STARTED IN MY DISTRICT.

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.945
AS 50% LARGER THAN THE LARGEST

02:02:33.012 --> 02:02:34.280
FOREST FIRE ON HISTORY WHICH

02:02:34.346 --> 02:02:35.681
HAPPENED LAST YEAR.

02:02:35.748 --> 02:02:36.949
IN THE IN THE MEMBER FROM SANTA

02:02:37.016 --> 02:02:39.118
BARBARA'S DISTRICT.

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.587
WE HAVE TO CREATE A BALANCE IF

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:42.354
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS AND SO

02:02:42.421 --> 02:02:43.789
LATER THIS WEEK YOU'RE GONNA GET

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:47.026
A CHANCE. TO HELP US.

02:02:47.093 --> 02:02:48.494
SPEND POTENTIALLY PENNIES ON THE

02:02:48.561 --> 02:02:49.862
DOLLAR COMPARED WHAT WE SPEND ON

02:02:49.929 --> 02:02:52.531
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. TO HELP

02:02:52.598 --> 02:02:54.500

BUT I HOPE AT THE END OF THE DAY

02:03:04.043 --> 02:03:06.445
THAT THIS HOUSE RECOGNIZES THAT

02:03:06.512 --> 02:03:08.280
THE POOR AIR QUALITY PROBABLY

02:03:08.347 --> 02:03:09.715
THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE

02:03:09.782 --> 02:03:11.917
HISTORY OF MY DISTRICT.

02:03:11.984 --> 02:03:12.852

THEY DEPEND ON RARE EARTH

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:28.407
MATERIALS BATTERED MIND IN CHINA

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:30.509
95% FROM THE MATERIALS NEED FOR

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:31.543
THESE WHEN TURBINES ARE MIND IN

02:07:31.610 --> 02:07:33.612
CHINA.

02:07:33.679 --> 02:07:34.947
THE PROCESS OF EXTRACTING THESE

ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:40.185
IMPACTS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:41.620
THERE ENVIRONMENTALISTS WENT

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:43.222
THERE TO SEE TO LOOK AT THESE

02:07:43.288 --> 02:07:44.390
MINES IN THESE FACTORS NEED

02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:46.725
DUMPING GROUNDS ASSOCIATED.

02:07:46.792 --> 02:07:48.394
WITH THEIR RARE EARTH INDUSTRY.

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:49.728
AND HIS COMMENTS WERE THE BANKS

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.730
GREW HIGHER THE LAKE GREW LARGER

02:07:51.797 --> 02:07:53.198
AND THE STENCH IN FUMES GREW

02:07:53.265 --> 02:07:53.799
MORE OVERWHELMING [inaudible]

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:56.568
WITH THE WEEPS THE PLANTS WE

PLANTED JUST WEATHERED.

02:07:58.237 --> 02:07:59.271
AND THEN THE ANIMALS STARTED TO

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:01.006
SICKEN AND DIE PEOPLE TO BEGIN

02:08:01.073 --> 02:08:02.007
TO SUFFER.

02:08:02.074 --> 02:08:03.709
VILLAGERS SAY THEIR TEETH BEGAN

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:04.543

02:08:06.078 --> 02:08:07.212
SUFFERED FROM SEVERE SKIN AND

02:08:07.279 --> 02:08:09.181
RESPIRATORY DISEASES CHILDREN

02:08:09.248 --> 02:08:11.050
WERE BORN WITH SOFT BONES IN

02:08:11.116 --> 02:08:13.285
CANCER RATES SKYROCKETED.

02:08:13.352 --> 02:08:14.887
AND OFFICIALS CARRIED STUDIES

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:16.822
OUT FIVE YEARS AGO IN ONE OF THE

02:08:16.889 --> 02:08:18.323
VILLAGES WHERE THEY'RE UNUSUALLY

02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:19.825
HIGH RATES OF CANCER ALONG WITH

02:08:19.892 --> 02:08:21.427
HIGH RATES OF OSTEOPOROSIS AND

02:08:21.493 --> 02:08:22.828
SKINNER RESPIRATORY DISEASE THIS

02:08:22.895 --> 02:08:24.396
IS THE LAKES RADIATION LEVELS

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:26.298
WERE TEN TIMES HIGHER.

02:08:26.365 --> 02:08:26.799
THAN IN THE SURROUNDING

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.267
COUNTRYSIDE.

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:28.834
SO I JUST WANT YOU TO THINK

ABOUT.

02:08:30.836 --> 02:08:32.337
THE EFFORTS THAT YOU'RE CHOOSING

02:08:32.404 --> 02:08:34.673
TO MAKE.

02:08:34.740 --> 02:08:35.774
THE EFFECT THAT THAT'S GOING TO

02:08:35.841 --> 02:08:38.143
HAVE ON FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS.

02:08:38.210 --> 02:08:39.978
BECAUSE AS THIS.

02:08:40.045 --> 02:08:41.313
PARTICULAR ENVIRONMENTALISTS

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:43.115
STATED THERE IS NOT ONE STEP A

02:08:43.182 --> 02:08:44.750
RARE EARTH MINING PROCESS THAT

02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:46.018
IS NOT DISASTROUS FOR THE

02:08:46.085 --> 02:08:48.153
ENVIRONMENT.

02:08:48.220 --> 02:08:49.288

PERHAPS YOU HAVEN'T THOUGHT

IN THESE EFFORTS WE'RE TAKING

02:12:30.942 --> 02:12:34.646

02:12:34.713 --> 02:12:36.181
THAT IS MY POINT WITH THIS THAT

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:37.916

TOWARDS THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:33.318
ACTUALLY PUT US IN A BETTER SPOT

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:34.686
NOT IN A GREAT SPOT BUT IN A

02:16:34.753 --> 02:16:36.221
BETTER SPOT.

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:37.188
AND SO HERE WE HAVE AN

02:16:37.255 --> 02:16:38.757
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO

02:16:38.823 --> 02:16:39.724
STIMULATE.

02:16:39.791 --> 02:16:41.693
AN ECONOMY OF RENEWABLE ENERGIES

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:43.662
AND TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE ALSO

02:16:43.728 --> 02:16:45.297
HAVE TO BE MINDFUL AND IT'S BEEN

02:16:45.363 --> 02:16:46.765
BROUGHT UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN.

02:16:46.831 --> 02:16:48.066
THAT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A WAY

02:16:48.133 --> 02:16:50.068
IN WHICH WE CAN DIVERSIFY THE

02:16:50.135 --> 02:16:51.169
PORTFOLIO.

02:16:51.236 --> 02:16:53.772
A BALANCED RELIABLE GREAT SYSTEM

02:16:53.838 --> 02:16:57.208
THAT WILL ALLOW US NOT ONLY.

02:16:57.275 --> 02:16:58.677
TO ADDRESS THE OVER GENERATION

02:16:58.743 --> 02:17:00.845
ISSUES BUT ALSO CREATE ECONOMIC

02:17:00.912 --> 02:17:02.881
OPPORTUNITIES IN PLACES OF

02:17:02.948 --> 02:17:04.516
ECONOMIC NEEDS.

02:17:04.583 --> 02:17:05.850
WHETHER YOU'RE IN LAKE COUNTY OR

02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:07.452
IN IMPAIR OAK COUNTY.

02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:09.054
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES HAVE

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.755
TO BE INTENTIONAL.

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:13.091
THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CREATE

02:17:13.158 --> 02:17:14.559
NOT ONLY THE OBJECTIVES THAT

02:17:14.626 --> 02:17:15.827
WE'RE SHOOTING FOR BUT THE

02:17:15.894 --> 02:17:17.562
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ECONOMIC

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:19.097
GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.

02:17:19.164 --> 02:17:20.632
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT.

02:17:20.699 --> 02:17:22.601
DEBATE SHOULD BE ABOUT.

02:17:22.667 --> 02:17:24.569
I THINK THAT WE HAVE A UNIQUE

02:17:24.636 --> 02:17:26.705
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS.

02:17:26.771 --> 02:17:28.340
THIS ISSUE OF THE DUCK CURVE THE

02:17:28.406 --> 02:17:31.776
OVER GENERATION BY INTRODUCING.

02:17:31.843 --> 02:17:33.678
OTHER RENEWAL BALLS THAT ARE

02:17:33.745 --> 02:17:36.748
BASED LOW FLEXIBLE AND RELIABLE.

02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:38.416
AND YOU KNOW FOR SOME PEOPLE THE

02:17:38.483 --> 02:17:40.652
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FIRES HAS

02:17:40.719 --> 02:17:42.654
FORCED US TO GET TO A PLACE IN

02:17:42.721 --> 02:17:44.522
WHICH BIOMASS IS A CONVERSATION

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:47.225
THAT'S TAKING PLACE. FOR MANY

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:48.760
IT'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE PLACE BUT

02:17:48.827 --> 02:17:50.762
FOR SOME OF US IT'S AN EXTREMELY

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:51.696
IMPORTANT ONE NOT JUST TO

02:17:51.763 --> 02:17:54.432
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE FIRES.

02:17:54.499 --> 02:17:56.334
BUT THE ISSUE OF JOBS ON AN

02:17:56.401 --> 02:17:57.936
ONGOING BASIS AND SPECIFIC PARTS

02:17:58.003 --> 02:17:59.371
OF THE STATE.

02:17:59.437 --> 02:18:00.872
WE ALSO HAVE A UNIQUE

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:02.907
OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE.

02:18:02.974 --> 02:18:03.942
SOME OF THE SOLAR WIND

02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:05.377
OPPORTUNITIES PRIOR TO THE TAX

02:18:05.443 --> 02:18:07.078
CREDIT.

02:18:07.145 --> 02:18:09.314
ASPIRING AND YES MAKING SURE

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:10.548
THAT WE CONTINUE TO EMPLOY

02:18:10.615 --> 02:18:12.350
PEOPLE IN THOSE SECTORS.

02:18:12.417 --> 02:18:14.152
BUT I THINK THAT BY INCREASING

02:18:14.219 --> 02:18:16.321
THE RP YES THAT'S HOW WE BRING

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.523
ABOUT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND AS

02:18:18.590 --> 02:18:19.991
THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL WOULD SAY

02:18:20.058 --> 02:18:22.494
WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL.

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.529
HOW WE MOVE FORWARD HE SAYS THE

02:18:24.596 --> 02:18:26.464
WORD INTENTIONALITY?

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:29.267
WE MUST BE INTENTIONAL WITH OUR

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:30.535
POLICIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:18:30.602 --> 02:18:32.237
CAN.

02:18:32.303 --> 02:18:34.039
DIVERSE SYFY THE PORTFOLIO AND

02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:36.408

MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THAT ARENA

02:18:37.976 --> 02:18:38.443
OF THE EFFORTS TO FIND THE

02:18:38.510 --> 02:18:40.779
PORTFOLIO AND MAKING SURE THAT

02:18:40.845 --> 02:18:42.247

BENEFITS FROM MY CLIMATE CHANGE

02:18:44.015 --> 02:18:45.850
POLICIES IT IS ABOUT EQUITY.

02:18:45.917 --> 02:18:47.152
IT IS ABOUT DIVERSIFYING THE

02:18:47.218 --> 02:18:49.087
PORTFOLIO BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT

02:18:49.154 --> 02:18:50.522
PEOPLE AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:52.023
EVERYONE HERE HAS MENTIONED THAT

02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:53.858
WE MUST LOOK OUT FOR THE PUBLIC

02:18:53.925 --> 02:18:54.392
HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF

02:18:54.459 --> 02:18:55.360
CALIFORNIANS.

02:18:55.427 --> 02:18:56.628
WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT OUR

02:18:56.695 --> 02:18:58.329
CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES HERE AND

02:18:58.396 --> 02:18:59.564
THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK

THE INDUSTRY IS GONNA CHANGE BUT

02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:45.370
MAY NOT EVEN BE ACCOUNTING FOR

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:46.404
THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE GOING

02:21:12.330 --> 02:21:13.665
JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY A COUPLE

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:17.735
POINTS BRING IDEAS AND I THINK.

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:18.903
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LOS ANGELES

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:20.371
IN THEIR TRAFFIC OR CONFUSING

02:21:20.438 --> 02:21:21.840
TRANSPORTATION.

02:21:21.906 --> 02:21:24.008
WITH THE GREAT SYSTEM.

02:21:24.075 --> 02:21:25.610
I WE HAD THAT PROBLEM LAST YEAR

02:21:25.677 --> 02:21:26.845
AND THE DISCUSSION AND CAP AND

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:27.445
TRADE THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

02:21:27.512 --> 02:21:29.781
THINGS.

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:31.716
ISSUE ABOUT CHANGING OUR ENERGY

02:21:31.783 --> 02:21:32.684
POLICIES IN THIS NOT HAVING AN

02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:34.018
IMPACT.

02:21:34.085 --> 02:21:35.420
IT CLEARLY IS HAVING AN IMPACT

02:21:35.486 --> 02:21:36.621
JUST GO TALK TO ANY

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.022
MANUFACTURING COMPANY.

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:39.190
AND ASK THEM HOW THEIR ENERGY

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:41.826
COST IS AND HOW THEY COMPARE IT.

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:42.627
THAT'S THERE ARE NATIONAL

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:44.462
ORGANIZATION I'LL SHOW YOU

02:21:44.529 --> 02:21:45.430
ENERGY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:47.198
CALIFORNIA TO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

02:21:47.265 --> 02:21:48.066
AND I REMEMBER TALKING TO A

02:21:48.132 --> 02:21:50.068
GENTLEMAN SAYING WHAT HE REALLY

02:21:50.134 --> 02:21:52.036
FEARS IS THAT THE PEOPLE THESE

02:21:52.103 --> 02:21:54.439
PAN USE TRIES GIMMICK GOOD WAGE

02:21:54.505 --> 02:21:55.874
TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS AN HOUR.

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:57.375
BUT HE KNOWS THE ENERGY COSTS

02:21:57.442 --> 02:21:58.376
THEIR PAIN IS SIGNIFICANTLY

02:21:58.443 --> 02:22:00.912
HIGHER YOU SAYS I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:22:00.979 --> 02:22:02.280
THEY'RE MAKING IT ON THESE WAGES.

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:03.514
SO THERE IS AN ENERGY COST TO

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:05.984
THE WORKING POOR.

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:07.585
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ONE

02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:08.920
THE BIG DISCUSSION RARELY TALKED

02:22:08.987 --> 02:22:10.688
ABOUT AS REGIONALIZATION OF THE

02:22:10.755 --> 02:22:12.757
WESTERN GRID HOUSE GOING IMPACT.

02:22:12.824 --> 02:22:15.059
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM.

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:16.327
AND SO THAT YOU NEED TO THROW

02:22:16.394 --> 02:22:17.929
THAT IN THERE.

02:22:17.996 --> 02:22:19.430
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU JUST LIKE

02:22:19.497 --> 02:22:22.100
I DO LIKE TO LISTEN TO A PODCAST

02:22:22.166 --> 02:22:23.668

HE WAS TALKING ABOUT FUSION

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:27.572
INTERNATIONAL EXPERIMENT GOING

02:22:27.639 --> 02:22:28.973
IN EUROPE WERE ACTUALLY UNITED

02:22:29.040 --> 02:22:30.508
STATES PARTICIPATING.

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:32.777
AND LOOKING AT FUSION ENERGY TO

02:22:32.844 --> 02:22:33.945
SOLVE THE ENERGY PROBLEMS OF THE

02:22:34.012 --> 02:22:36.014
WORLD IN THE LOOKING AT DOING

02:22:36.080 --> 02:22:37.548
THAT WITHIN A DECADE.

02:22:37.615 --> 02:22:38.116
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE A WHOLE

02:22:38.182 --> 02:22:39.717
DISCUSSION.

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:41.219
BUT LET'S GO TO THIS ISSUE WE'RE

02:22:41.286 --> 02:22:45.990
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

02:22:46.057 --> 02:22:46.925
IT'S NICE TO SEE THERE WAS WITH

02:22:46.991 --> 02:22:48.660
CLIMATE CHANGE UP FIVE YEARS AGO

02:22:48.726 --> 02:22:50.228
AS A REPUBLICAN STANDING UP

02:22:50.295 --> 02:22:51.562

THAT POSITION.

02:26:57.808 --> 02:26:59.844

AND I'M A CONSERVATIVE.

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:14.952
I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN WE'VE GONE.

02:28:15.019 --> 02:28:16.520
A LONG WAY IN A VERY SHORT

02:28:16.587 --> 02:28:17.888
AMOUNT OF TIME WITH THAT BELIEVE

I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

02:28:25.096 --> 02:28:26.597
THE FOR THAT TO TO LOOK AT THIS

02:28:26.664 --> 02:28:28.366
IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF

02:28:28.432 --> 02:28:30.968
THE NEEDS OF OF CALIFORNIANS.

02:28:31.035 --> 02:28:33.070
YOU I VOTED NO ON THIS BILL IN A

02:28:33.137 --> 02:28:34.972
COMMITTEE.

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:36.507
BUT IT WASN'T BECAUSE I DON'T

02:28:36.574 --> 02:28:38.009
BELIEVE IN THE EFFORT AND THE

02:28:38.075 --> 02:28:40.011
BECAUSE IN FACT I THINK THAT WE

02:28:40.077 --> 02:28:41.612
NEED TO GET TO A POINT TO OUR

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:42.913
LOGICAL SYSTEM IS.

02:28:42.980 --> 02:28:45.316
A 100% RENEWABLE THAT IT IS

02:28:45.383 --> 02:28:47.952
CLEAN AND THAT IT IS ZERO CARBON.

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:49.887
THE REALITY IS GREENHOUSE GAS

02:28:49.954 --> 02:28:50.988
EMISSIONS ARE NEGATIVE

02:28:51.055 --> 02:28:52.623
EXTERNALITY AND WE HAVE A

02:28:52.690 --> 02:28:54.392
RESPONSIBILITY ALL OF US HAVE A

02:28:54.458 --> 02:28:56.027
RESPONSIBILITY TO FACTOR THAT IN

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:57.261
OUR OWN LIVES.

02:28:57.328 --> 02:28:58.996
AND TRY TO RID THAT NEGATIVE X.

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:00.865
NOW DO WE KNOW IT IS HAVING AN

02:29:00.931 --> 02:29:02.099
IMPACT ON OUR STATE.

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:03.801
AND OUR COUNTRY.

02:29:03.868 --> 02:29:06.304

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:09.140
WELL.

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:11.242
BUT I THINK THIS BILL HAS A FEW

02:29:11.309 --> 02:29:13.110
ERRORS IN IT IN FACT.

02:29:13.177 --> 02:29:14.612
BEARS ARE THAT.

02:29:14.679 --> 02:29:16.847
WE'RE PICKING WINNERS.

02:29:16.914 --> 02:29:18.849
AND WE'RE PICKING LOSERS AND I

02:29:18.916 --> 02:29:20.751
THINK OUR GOAL NEEDS TO BE TO

02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:23.020
WORK IN A BIPARTISAN WAY.

02:29:23.087 --> 02:29:23.988
WE DON'T NEED TO VOTE FOR THIS

02:29:24.055 --> 02:29:25.323
BILL TODAY [inaudible]

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:28.893
WE HAVE TIME NEXT YEAR AND I'M

02:29:28.959 --> 02:29:30.227
COMMITTED MYSELF I KNOW THERE'S

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:31.929
A HANDFUL OF OTHER REPUBLICANS

02:29:31.996 --> 02:29:33.364
THAT ARE COMMITTED TO THIS TO

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:34.832
MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COME UP

02:29:34.899 --> 02:29:36.067
WITH A PROGRAM.

02:29:36.133 --> 02:29:38.169
THAT IS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL.

02:29:38.235 --> 02:29:39.303
THEN MAKE SURE THAT WE GET RID

02:29:39.370 --> 02:29:40.571
OF THAT NEGATIVE EXTERNALITY

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:41.639
WHICH IS GREENHOUSE GAS

02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:43.574
EMISSIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:46.877
CAN PROVIDE FOR A HEALTHY.

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:48.412
AND I BY AN ECONOMY ARE GOING

02:29:48.479 --> 02:29:50.047
FORWARD.

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:51.515
SO I'D ASK THAT TODAY THAT'S

02:29:51.582 --> 02:29:53.017
JUST HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON LET'S

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:54.618
BEGIN WORKING IN THE FALL MAYBE

02:29:54.685 --> 02:29:56.721
NEXT YEAR I'LL TRY TO PUT A

02:29:56.787 --> 02:29:58.422
BIPARTISAN PLAN TOGETHER. FOR

02:29:58.489 --> 02:29:59.290
TODAY I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN

02:29:59.357 --> 02:30:01.425
OBOE [inaudible]

02:30:01.492 --> 02:30:03.661
CUNNINGHAM.

02:30:03.728 --> 02:30:06.330
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER.

02:30:06.397 --> 02:30:07.431
THEN A LONG DISCUSSION BUT I'D

02:30:07.498 --> 02:30:09.834
LIKE TO ECHO THE POINTS MADE BY.

02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:11.102
MY COLLEAGUE FROM [inaudible]

02:30:11.168 --> 02:30:14.004
MERCED.

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:16.874
WHEN YOU PICK WINNERS AND LOSERS?

02:30:16.941 --> 02:30:18.542
IN LEGISLATION THAT MANDATES

02:30:18.609 --> 02:30:20.644
CERTAIN THINGS.

02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:21.912
ARE OKAY UNDER THE LAW AND OTHER

02:30:21.979 --> 02:30:24.582
THINGS ARE NOT.

02:30:24.648 --> 02:30:26.751
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT.

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:28.085
AND MY DISTRICT IS GOING TO FEEL

02:30:28.152 --> 02:30:28.953
THE CONSEQUENCES OF A DECISION

02:30:29.019 --> 02:30:30.721
MADE.

02:30:30.788 --> 02:30:32.890
MANY MANY YEARS AGO. TO NOT

02:30:32.957 --> 02:30:34.792
INCLUDE NUCLEAR POWER IN THE

02:30:34.859 --> 02:30:37.361
RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD.

02:30:37.428 --> 02:30:38.863
DIABLO CANYON THE LAST NUCLEAR

02:30:38.929 --> 02:30:40.164
POWER PLANT LEFT IN CALIFORNIA

02:30:40.231 --> 02:30:43.401
WHICH PROVIDES. 9% OF THE

02:30:43.467 --> 02:30:46.203
STATE'S ELECTRICITY WITH ZERO

02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:48.072
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LET ME

02:30:48.139 --> 02:30:50.307
SAY THAT AGAIN 9%.

02:30:50.374 --> 02:30:52.710
THE STATE'S ELECTRICITY WITH

02:30:52.777 --> 02:30:55.713
ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS.

02:30:55.780 --> 02:30:57.715
WHITE HYDRO POWER THERE IS NO

02:30:57.782 --> 02:31:00.050
SCIENCE SUPPORTING THE LACK OF

02:31:00.117 --> 02:31:01.318
INCLUSION OF NUCLEAR POWER.

02:31:01.385 --> 02:31:04.388
IN THE RPF STANDARD.

02:31:04.455 --> 02:31:05.656
NOW THAT'S HISTORY THAT'S FINE

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:06.991
BUT I JUST OFFER THAT

02:31:07.057 --> 02:31:09.427
ILLUSTRATION BECAUSE IN TWENTY

02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:10.161
TWENTY FIVE DIABLO CANYON IS

02:31:10.227 --> 02:31:11.929
GOING OFF LINE IT'S SHUTTING

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:12.530
DOWN IT WILL BE DECOMMISSIONED

02:31:12.596 --> 02:31:13.097
OVER [inaudible]

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:15.599
DECADES.

02:31:15.666 --> 02:31:18.135
MY COMMUNITY WILL LOSE FIFTEEN

02:31:18.202 --> 02:31:19.937
HUNDRED HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD JOBS

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:21.539
AND A BILLION DOLLARS OF

02:31:21.605 --> 02:31:22.673
ECONOMIC.

02:31:22.740 --> 02:31:25.509
ACTIVITY IN MY DISTRICT

02:31:25.576 --> 02:31:25.810
[inaudible]

02:31:25.876 --> 02:31:27.278
I HOPE.

02:31:27.344 --> 02:31:28.813
IT IS NOT LIKE THE CLOSING OF

02:31:28.879 --> 02:31:31.015
THE STEEL MILLS IN PITTSBURGH.

02:31:31.081 --> 02:31:33.184
BUT I FEAR IT MIGHT BE.

02:31:33.250 --> 02:31:34.251
SO WHEN YOU PICK WINNERS AND

02:31:34.318 --> 02:31:35.553
LOSERS IN LEGISLATION

02:31:35.619 --> 02:31:35.853
[inaudible]

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.788
PLEASE REMEMBER.

02:31:37.855 --> 02:31:39.723
THAT THERE ARE LOSERS.

02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:41.125
AND ISRAEL AND IMPACTS THE

02:31:41.192 --> 02:31:43.527
COMMUNITY.

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:45.930
IN A MAJOR MAJOR WAY.

02:31:45.996 --> 02:31:47.031
THAT IS NOT TO SAY I DON'T

02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:47.932
ACCEPT SCIENCE AYE DEGREE IN

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:49.467
PHYSICS.

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:51.235
STOOD WITH PEOPLE.

02:31:51.302 --> 02:31:52.670
THAT SHOWED TREMENDOUS COURAGE

02:31:52.736 --> 02:31:54.572
LAST YEAR CROSSING THE AISLE TO

02:31:54.638 --> 02:31:56.307
ENACT A SIGNATURE.

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:57.975
PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT A LOT

02:31:58.042 --> 02:32:01.045
OF US PAY THE COST. FOR FOR THE

02:32:01.111 --> 02:32:03.314
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ECONOMY.

02:32:03.380 --> 02:32:05.716
I ACCEPT SCIENCE.

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:06.550
I THINK CLIMATE CHANGE NEEDS TO

02:32:06.617 --> 02:32:09.854
BE ADDRESSED.

02:32:09.920 --> 02:32:11.021
BUT OTHER THINGS HAVE TO BE

02:32:11.088 --> 02:32:15.092
ADDRESSED TO PUTTING ECONOMICS.

02:32:15.159 --> 02:32:15.860
I ASKED YOU TO HIT THE PAUSE

02:32:15.926 --> 02:32:16.961
BUTTON WHAT'S GO BACK TO WORK ON

02:32:17.027 --> 02:32:18.395
THIS.

02:32:18.462 --> 02:32:20.197
AND NEXT YEAR WHAT'S ENACT

02:32:20.264 --> 02:32:23.100
SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE WORLD.

02:32:23.167 --> 02:32:25.803
WE'LL LOOK AT AS A MODEL. FOR

02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.972
HOW THE ENTIRE WORLD IS GOING TO

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:33.911
SOLVE EXISTENTIAL PROBLEMS.

02:32:33.978 --> 02:32:36.814
THANK YOU MEMBERS.

02:32:36.881 --> 02:32:39.183
SEEING NO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION.

02:32:39.250 --> 02:32:41.485
OR DEBATE ON THE ITEM.

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:43.521
MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER YOU MAY

02:32:43.587 --> 02:32:45.489
CLOSE THANK YOU I DO WANT TO

02:32:45.556 --> 02:32:46.123
ADDRESS A FEW THINGS THAT WERE

02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:47.958
BROUGHT UP BECAUSE IN SOME WAYS

02:32:48.025 --> 02:32:49.260
IF I LISTEN TO ALL OF YOU IT

02:32:49.326 --> 02:32:51.729
SOUNDS GOOD.

02:32:51.795 --> 02:32:53.797
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY TRUE.

02:32:53.864 --> 02:32:56.433
THERE'S NO PLAN I HEARD.

02:32:56.500 --> 02:32:57.902
THE SAME PERSON WHO SAID THERE'S

02:32:57.968 --> 02:33:00.504
NO PLAN SUGGESTED IN TEN YEARS

02:33:00.571 --> 02:33:01.572
WILL HAVE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

02:33:01.639 --> 02:33:03.240
TECHNOLOGY.

02:33:03.307 --> 02:33:06.477
THAT'S WHY WE CANNOT PRESCRIBE.

02:33:06.544 --> 02:33:08.445
WHAT TYPE OF POWER THIS'S?

02:33:08.512 --> 02:33:11.982
THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY.

02:33:12.049 --> 02:33:15.152
DO MORE THAN SET THE GOALS.

02:33:15.219 --> 02:33:16.887
BECAUSE THAT PLAN HAS TO

02:33:16.954 --> 02:33:18.522
CONTINUE TO BE WRITTEN AND RE

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:19.790
WRITTEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THIS

02:33:19.857 --> 02:33:22.359
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

02:33:22.426 --> 02:33:24.929
IN TWENTY EIGHT YEARS.

02:33:24.995 --> 02:33:25.930
OUR SOURCES OF POWER ARE GOING

02:33:25.996 --> 02:33:28.165
TO CHANGE THAT THINGS ARE GOING

02:33:28.232 --> 02:33:31.802
TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE.

02:33:31.869 --> 02:33:33.637
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPE OF

02:33:33.704 --> 02:33:35.306
PRESCRIPTIVE PLAN.

02:33:35.372 --> 02:33:38.042
YOU WOULD WANT OR COULD VOTE ON

02:33:38.108 --> 02:33:39.043
AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING

02:33:39.109 --> 02:33:40.244
ABOUT IS CUTTING OFF LITTLE

02:33:40.311 --> 02:33:41.612
PIECES OF PORK FOR EVERY

02:33:41.679 --> 02:33:43.213
INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT IN THE TYPE

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:44.114
OF POWER.

02:33:44.181 --> 02:33:46.083
THAT YOU WANT IN YOUR DISTRICT

02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.585
AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT COST

02:33:47.651 --> 02:33:48.218
CONTAINMENT THAT'S NOT GOING TO

02:33:48.285 --> 02:33:49.787
DO IT.

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:50.888
IT DOESN'T ITS TECHNOLOGY

02:33:50.955 --> 02:33:52.690
NEUTRAL.

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:53.724
IT HAS TO BE BECAUSE OUR

02:33:53.791 --> 02:33:55.292
TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY

02:33:55.359 --> 02:33:57.161
CHANGING.

02:33:57.227 --> 02:33:59.029
AND BECAUSE IT IS OUR NEXT

02:33:59.096 --> 02:34:01.265
GENERATION WHO ARE GOING TO NOT

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.833
ONLY.

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:04.101
BENEFIT FROM THIS AS FAR AS

02:34:04.168 --> 02:34:05.836
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT BENEFITS FROM

02:34:05.903 --> 02:34:06.570
THIS BECAUSE THERE THE

02:34:06.637 --> 02:34:07.771
INNOVATORS WE'RE GOING TO BE

02:34:07.838 --> 02:34:08.772
CHANGING.

02:34:08.839 --> 02:34:10.507
HOW WE SEE?

02:34:10.574 --> 02:34:12.242
ELECTRICITY IN THE FUTURE.

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:14.712
BUT WE KNOW IT'S POSSIBLE WE NO

02:34:14.778 --> 02:34:16.213
THAT WE CAN GO CARBON FREE WE

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:17.481
KNOW WE HAVEN'T HAD PROBLEMS

02:34:17.548 --> 02:34:18.215
MEETING THOSE.

02:34:18.282 --> 02:34:19.950
RENEWABLE STANDARDS.

02:34:20.017 --> 02:34:22.820
WE KNOW THIS.

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:25.422
SO THIS ALLOWS A PLAN TO COME

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:27.758
BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE.

02:34:27.825 --> 02:34:29.860
AFTER WE MEET OUR 60% CALL.

02:34:29.927 --> 02:34:32.196
THAT MAKES SENSE.

02:34:32.262 --> 02:34:33.797
IT'S A LOT LIKE AT THAT POINT WE

02:34:33.864 --> 02:34:34.498
ARE.

02:34:34.565 --> 02:34:36.567
THOSE FOLKS TO WILL REPLACE AS

02:34:36.634 --> 02:34:39.970
CAN ASPIRIN ALEJO ANALYSIS.

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:41.238
WE CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS

02:34:41.305 --> 02:34:42.706
DISCUSSION WHAT TODAY IS ABOUT

02:34:42.773 --> 02:34:44.375
THE SAME ARE WE GONNA HOLD OUR

02:34:44.441 --> 02:34:49.013
FEET TO THE FIRE ON THIS ISSUE.

02:34:49.079 --> 02:34:49.847
HOPEFULLY ON FRIDAY WE'RE GOING

02:34:49.913 --> 02:34:51.482
TO ASK IF WE HOLD OUR FEET TO

02:34:51.548 --> 02:34:54.718
THE FIRE ON THE WILDFIRE.

02:34:54.785 --> 02:34:56.687
BECAUSE FOR THE FOLKS WHO SAID

02:34:56.754 --> 02:34:57.755
IT'S NOT JUST ELECTRICITY YOU'RE

02:34:57.821 --> 02:34:59.323
RIGHT.

02:34:59.390 --> 02:35:00.691
BUT THAT'S NOT AN EXCUSE TO NOT

02:35:00.758 --> 02:35:02.393
DEAL.

02:35:02.459 --> 02:35:04.995
WITH THE ELECTRICAL GRID.

02:35:05.062 --> 02:35:06.730
IT'S THE EASIEST ONE IT'S A

02:35:06.797 --> 02:35:08.565
LOWEST HANGING FRUIT ABSOLUTELY

02:35:08.632 --> 02:35:09.900
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.268
TO LOOK AT TAILPIPES ABSOLUTELY

02:35:11.335 --> 02:35:12.736
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO CONTINUE TO

02:35:12.803 --> 02:35:14.505
LOOK AT WILD FIRES ABSOLUTELY.

02:35:14.571 --> 02:35:16.940
BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD NOT.

02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:17.875
TO AND EVEN IF FOR JUST A LITTLE

02:35:17.941 --> 02:35:19.576
CALIFORNIA.

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:21.111
WE ARE SHOWING BY EXAMPLE THAT

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:23.747
THIS CAN BE DONE.

02:35:23.814 --> 02:35:24.815
SINCE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER

02:35:24.882 --> 02:35:27.885
SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER IN

02:35:27.951 --> 02:35:28.519
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE COST OF

02:35:28.585 --> 02:35:31.488
SOLAR HAS COME DOWN 77%.

02:35:31.555 --> 02:35:32.623
AND LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:35:32.690 --> 02:35:34.291
ABOUT ENERGY BILLS BECAUSE I'VE

02:35:34.358 --> 02:35:36.060
HEARD A LOT TODAY.

02:35:36.126 --> 02:35:37.861
BUT I WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LOOK

02:35:37.928 --> 02:35:38.295
AT THE U. S. ENERGY.

02:35:38.362 --> 02:35:41.732
INC [inaudible]

02:35:41.799 --> 02:35:44.001
INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION.

02:35:44.068 --> 02:35:46.637
YOU'LL FIND S..

02:35:46.704 --> 02:35:50.007
WE PAY ONE THIRD PER HOUSEHOLD.

02:35:50.074 --> 02:35:50.941
FOR ELECTRICAL UTILITY RATES AS

02:35:51.008 --> 02:35:54.344
TEXAS.

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:56.714
WE PAY A HALF.

02:35:56.780 --> 02:36:00.250
OF WHAT LOUISIANA PAYS.

02:36:00.317 --> 02:36:01.585
THERE ARE INCREASES IN

02:36:01.652 --> 02:36:03.787
ELECTRICITY I UNDERSTAND THIS I

02:36:03.854 --> 02:36:05.489
LIVE IN A DISTRICT WHERE THIS IS

02:36:05.556 --> 02:36:07.357
HAPPENING AND YOU KNOW WHY.

02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:08.425
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING SOMETHING

02:36:08.492 --> 02:36:10.327
THAT WE NEVER DEAD.

02:36:10.394 --> 02:36:11.228
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP RUNNING

02:36:11.295 --> 02:36:13.263
AIR CONDITIONERS?

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:15.499
ALMOST ALL THE TIME.

02:36:15.566 --> 02:36:16.100
AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF CLIMATE

02:36:16.166 --> 02:36:17.701
CHANGE.

02:36:17.768 --> 02:36:18.769
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT POOR

02:36:18.836 --> 02:36:20.370
FAMILIES AND HOW THIS AFFECTS

02:36:20.437 --> 02:36:22.106
POOR FAMILIES I LIVE IN A

02:36:22.172 --> 02:36:23.107
COMMUNITY OF WORKING CLASS

02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:24.975
FAMILIES I REPRESENT A COMMITTEE

02:36:25.042 --> 02:36:26.443
WORKING CLASS FAMILIES?

02:36:26.510 --> 02:36:27.878
FIRST WELL LET'S BE HONEST WE

02:36:27.945 --> 02:36:29.446
HAVE A GREAT.

DEAL WITH LOCAL AGENCIES.

DECISIONS.

07:11:14.782 --> 07:11:16.350

THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

07:13:12.966 --> 07:13:14.635
THIS RARE REALITY THAT IN THE

07:13:14.702 --> 07:13:15.936
RECENT YEARS CITIES HAVE

07:13:16.003 --> 07:13:17.304
APPROVED THOUSANDS OF HOUSING

07:13:17.371 --> 07:13:19.039

07:13:22.176 --> 07:13:23.410
OH MY GOD.

07:13:26.113 --> 07:13:27.448
LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY NOT OPEN

07:13:27.514 --> 07:13:28.515
UP THE POSSIBILITY OF

07:13:28.582 --> 07:13:29.750
INCONSISTENT PLANNING THAT MAY

07:13:29.817 --> 07:13:30.784
CONFLICT WITH CITY AND COUNTY

07:13:30.851 --> 07:13:31.919
GENERAL PLANS.

07:13:31.985 --> 07:13:34.021
AND JUST THINK ABOUT IT THIS MAY

BICU DE PRIME LOCATION.

07:13:43.564 --> 07:13:45.432
BUT NOT IN RURAL BECAUSE IT

07:13:45.499 --> 07:13:47.368
HASN'T BEEN DEVELOPED IT CREATES

07:13:47.434 --> 07:13:49.570
AN INCONSISTENCY FOR DEVELOPERS

07:13:49.636 --> 07:13:51.038
AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

07:13:51.105 --> 07:13:53.073
TO HAPPEN AND NOW.

07:13:53.140 --> 07:13:54.742
THEY'RE GONNA BE SHIRKING THE

07:13:54.808 --> 07:13:57.277
WILLINGNESS TO GO FORWARD

07:13:57.344 --> 07:13:57.578

07:13:57.644 --> 07:13:59.346
LET'S SOME.

07:13:59.413 --> 07:14:00.214
KEEP IT THAT WAY NOT OPEN UP THE

07:14:00.280 --> 07:14:01.682
POSSIBILITY OF INCONSISTENT

07:14:01.749 --> 07:14:02.850
PLANNING.

07:14:02.916 --> 07:14:03.951
THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH CITY AND

07:14:04.017 --> 07:14:04.885
COUNTY GENERAL PLANS THAT WERE

07:14:04.952 --> 07:14:06.854
PUT IN PLACE.

07:14:06.920 --> 07:14:08.122
OVER YEARS AND YEARS OF

07:14:08.188 --> 07:14:10.057
CONSIDERATION.

07:14:10.124 --> 07:14:12.926
BY THEIR CONSTITUENTS ALSO.

07:14:12.993 --> 07:14:14.061
LET'S AGREE THAT PLANNING FOR

07:14:14.128 --> 07:14:15.763
METROPOLITAN AREAS VERSUS

07:14:15.829 --> 07:14:17.965
SUBURBAN AREAS AS I SAID SUCH AS

07:14:18.031 --> 07:14:20.901
MINE IS VASTLY DIFFERENT.

07:14:20.968 --> 07:14:22.369
GENERAL PLANS FOR AVAILABLE LAND

07:14:22.436 --> 07:14:24.338
IN THE SOBRE SUBURBS MUST NOT BE

07:14:24.405 --> 07:14:25.372
STYMIED BY A METROPOLITAN

07:14:25.439 --> 07:14:27.274
DEVELOPERS.

07:14:27.341 --> 07:14:27.908
THE AIM IS APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR

07:14:27.975 --> 07:14:29.943
REGION.

07:14:30.010 --> 07:14:31.345
THE GENERAL PLANS WHICH LOCAL

07:14:31.412 --> 07:14:32.379
ELECTED OFFICIALS ON THE

07:14:32.446 --> 07:14:34.214
CONSTITUENTS HAVE AGREED UPON IN

07:14:34.281 --> 07:14:34.748
MANY CASES HAVE TAKEN AS I

07:14:34.815 --> 07:14:36.016
MENTIONED.

07:14:36.083 --> 07:14:38.318
YEARS TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT.

07:14:38.385 --> 07:14:39.553
THOUSANDS OF MY CONSTITUENTS

07:14:39.620 --> 07:14:42.055
BREITBART EVERY DAY AND RECENTLY

07:14:42.122 --> 07:14:43.424
A NEW STATION OPEN IN MY

07:14:43.490 --> 07:14:45.726
DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF ANTIOCH.

07:14:45.793 --> 07:14:47.094
THE PLANNING FOR THAT STATION OF

07:14:47.161 --> 07:14:48.829
WHICH I PARTICIPATED IN.

07:14:48.896 --> 07:14:50.597
AS A LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIAL

07:14:50.664 --> 07:14:52.533
REYES GRAVE CONCERNS. FOR ME

07:14:52.599 --> 07:14:53.767
REGARDING BART'S PLANNING

07:14:53.834 --> 07:14:56.069

07:14:56.136 --> 07:14:57.337
AGAIN THE BEST LOCAL ADVICE AND

07:14:57.404 --> 07:14:59.139
STATISTICS.

07:14:59.206 --> 07:15:00.574
BART'S NEW STATION WAS OPEN

07:15:00.641 --> 07:15:01.809
WITHOUT PROVING.

07:15:01.875 --> 07:15:03.510
PROVIDING ADEQUATE PARKING OR

07:15:03.577 --> 07:15:05.245
ADEQUATE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE

07:15:05.312 --> 07:15:07.748
VOLUME OF WRITERS THAT WE KNEW

07:15:07.815 --> 07:15:11.552
WE WOULD SEE BUT THEY IGNORE.

07:15:11.618 --> 07:15:12.786
MY CITIES OF BRENTWOOD IN

07:15:12.853 --> 07:15:13.320
PITTSBURGH ARE OFFICIALLY

07:15:13.387 --> 07:15:14.755
OPPOSED TO THIS LEGISLATION AND

07:15:14.822 --> 07:15:15.856
IN FACT.

07:15:15.923 --> 07:15:16.990
THE CITY OF BROWN WOULD SHARE

07:15:17.057 --> 07:15:18.625

HIS ENGAGEMENT ON THE SPELL IT

07:17:56.183 --> 07:17:57.551
HE DID SOMETHING THAT NOT MANY

07:17:59.219 --> 07:17:59.620

FOR AN HOUR OVER THE JULY RECESS

07:18:04.758 --> 07:18:06.059
I TO HEAR FROM THEM AND WHY THEY

OPPOSE THIS BILL AND I WANT TO

07:18:07.127 --> 07:18:08.261
THINK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN

07:18:08.328 --> 07:18:09.229
FRANCISCO FOR DOING THAT NOT

07:18:09.296 --> 07:18:10.831
MANY US WOULD DO THAT FOR FOLKS

07:18:10.897 --> 07:18:11.498
THAT ARE.

07:18:11.565 --> 07:18:13.200
NOT THEIR CONSTITUENTS THE

07:18:13.266 --> 07:18:14.901
REASON THEY CAME TO MEET WITH

07:18:14.968 --> 07:18:16.536
THE AUTHORS IS BECAUSE THIS BILL

07:18:16.603 --> 07:18:17.938
DRAMATICALLY AFFECTS

07:18:18.305 --> 07:18:20.007
MY CONSTITUENTS.

07:18:20.073 --> 07:18:21.675
AND SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

07:18:21.742 --> 07:18:23.276
A BILL THAT IS THIS DRAMATIC

07:18:23.343 --> 07:18:25.379
DEPARTURE NOT ONLY FROM OUR

07:18:25.445 --> 07:18:26.346
PRACTICE BUT FROM OUR

07:18:26.413 --> 07:18:28.315
CONSTITUTION AGAIN ARTICLE

07:18:28.382 --> 07:18:29.516
ELEVEN SECTIONAL LEVIN.

07:18:29.583 --> 07:18:31.652
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

07:18:31.718 --> 07:18:33.687
THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKING ON

07:18:33.754 --> 07:18:34.921
HOUSING NEEDS TO BE KEPT WITH

07:18:34.988 --> 07:18:36.256
THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES YOU

07:18:36.323 --> 07:18:37.491
NEED TO HAVE VERY VERY GOOD

07:18:37.557 --> 07:18:39.993
REASONS TO DO IT.

07:18:40.060 --> 07:18:40.827
YOU WOULD THINK THAT ONE OF THE

07:18:40.894 --> 07:18:42.429
REASONS MIGHT BE THAT PART HAS

07:18:42.496 --> 07:18:45.132
BEEN SUBMITTING AGAIN AND AGAIN.

07:18:45.198 --> 07:18:46.233
DIFFERENT PROPOSALS TO THE

07:18:46.299 --> 07:18:47.200
CITIES THAT THEY'VE CONTINUALLY

07:18:47.267 --> 07:18:48.368
REJECTED.

07:18:48.435 --> 07:18:50.337
THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

07:18:50.404 --> 07:18:51.505
AS ARE MEMBERS FROM OKLEE JUST

07:18:51.571 --> 07:18:54.041
IDENTIFIED BART HAS NOT PROPOSED

07:18:54.107 --> 07:18:55.442
A SINGLE PROPOSAL FOR

07:18:55.509 --> 07:18:56.410
DEVELOPMENT THAT HAS BEEN

07:18:56.476 --> 07:18:58.512
REJECTED BY A SINGLE ENTITY

07:18:58.578 --> 07:19:00.280
AFFECTED BY THIS BILL.

07:19:00.347 --> 07:19:01.782
SO IT'S NOT THAT PORTS PROPOSALS

07:19:01.848 --> 07:19:03.050
ARE GETTING REJECTED THAT'S

07:19:03.116 --> 07:19:04.084
THAT'S NOT A REASON TO GO

07:19:04.151 --> 07:19:05.686
AGAINST OUR PRACTICE MAYBE IT'S

07:19:05.752 --> 07:19:06.920
THAT THE CITIES THAT ARE MOST

07:19:06.987 --> 07:19:08.355
AFFECTED BY THIS BILL.

07:19:08.422 --> 07:19:09.890
ARE THE ONES THAT KEEP SAYING NO

07:19:09.956 --> 07:19:11.091
TO TRANSIT AREA DEVELOPMENT

07:19:11.158 --> 07:19:12.826
WHICH I FULLY EMBRACE.

07:19:12.893 --> 07:19:14.528
AND BELIEVE WE NEED TO TO HAVE

07:19:14.594 --> 07:19:16.229
AND PROMOTE TO HELP WITH THE

07:19:16.296 --> 07:19:17.898
HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA.

07:19:17.964 --> 07:19:20.267
THAT IS ALSO NOT THE CASE.

07:19:20.333 --> 07:19:22.002
THE CITY'S MOST AFFECTED BY THIS

07:19:22.069 --> 07:19:23.770
BILLS ARE THE ONES IN THE STATE

07:19:23.837 --> 07:19:26.473
WHO ARE THE VERY BEST AUTHORS.

07:19:26.540 --> 07:19:28.008
OF ALL KINDS OF PROPOSALS FOR

07:19:28.075 --> 07:19:29.309
TRANSITORY DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE

07:19:29.376 --> 07:19:30.444
EMBRACING IT MORE THAN OTHER

07:19:30.510 --> 07:19:31.311
CITIES AND YOU JUST NEED LOOK AT

07:19:31.378 --> 07:19:32.546
THE FACTS.

07:19:32.612 --> 07:19:33.880
THE CITY OF DUBLIN WHERE I'VE

07:19:33.947 --> 07:19:35.182
LIVED FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS

07:19:35.248 --> 07:19:37.350
HAS APPROVED OVER FOUR THOUSAND

07:19:37.417 --> 07:19:39.920

07:19:39.986 --> 07:19:41.121
TWO THOUSAND MULTI FAMILY UNITS

07:19:41.188 --> 07:19:42.756
ALONE ARE WITHIN A HALF MILE THE

07:19:42.823 --> 07:19:45.225
BART STATION.

07:19:45.292 --> 07:19:45.892
TWO THOUSAND IN FACT ARE USED TO

07:19:45.959 --> 07:19:47.260
BE A LARGE SURFACE LOT AT THAT

07:19:47.327 --> 07:19:48.628
DUBLIN STATION TRIPLE THE SIZE

07:19:48.695 --> 07:19:50.130
OF THE SERVICE A LOT AND IT'S

07:19:50.197 --> 07:19:51.832
ALL MULTI FAMILY.

07:19:51.898 --> 07:19:53.400
UNITS HIGH DENSITY HOUSING RIGHT

07:19:53.467 --> 07:19:55.702
NOW TODAY.

07:19:55.769 --> 07:19:57.304
IN FACT THE CITY OF DUBLIN IS

07:19:57.370 --> 07:19:59.039
MEETING ITS RINA NUMBERS FIVE

07:19:59.106 --> 07:20:00.941
YEARS IN ADVANCE AND THEY ARE

07:20:01.007 --> 07:20:02.275
THE NUMBER ONE CITY AFFECTED BY

07:20:02.342 --> 07:20:04.244
THIS BILL.

07:20:04.311 --> 07:20:05.812
PLEASANTON WHICH ALSO HAS A BART

07:20:05.879 --> 07:20:07.147
STATION WITH THE SURFACE PARKING

07:20:07.214 --> 07:20:08.882
LOT TO BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL

07:20:08.949 --> 07:20:10.817
HAS ALSO BUILT OVER A THOUSAND

07:20:10.884 --> 07:20:12.119
MULTI FAMILY HIGH DENSITY UNITS

07:20:12.185 --> 07:20:13.286
WITHIN A HALF MILE OF THE BART

07:20:13.353 --> 07:20:15.255
STATION.

07:20:15.322 --> 07:20:17.624
THEY WANTED TO DO MORE.

07:20:17.691 --> 07:20:19.192
THEY WANTED TO DO MORE UNITS AND

07:20:19.259 --> 07:20:20.827
IN FACT THEY APPROVED A PLAN FOR

07:20:20.894 --> 07:20:22.429
MORE UNITS ALMOST THREE HUNDRED

07:20:22.496 --> 07:20:23.797
UNITS ON BART OWNED LAND.

07:20:23.864 --> 07:20:25.832
AND BART SAID NO.

07:20:25.899 --> 07:20:27.300
BURKE SAID NO I'D RATHER HAVE A

07:20:27.367 --> 07:20:29.169
COMMERCIAL OFFICE LEASE.

07:20:29.236 --> 07:20:31.138
SO THE CITY AGAIN APPROVED

07:20:31.204 --> 07:20:33.306
HOUSING AND BART SAID NO.

07:20:33.373 --> 07:20:34.274
THE CITY OF WANNA CREEK IS

07:20:34.341 --> 07:20:35.942
ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

07:20:36.009 --> 07:20:37.811
THEY'VE APPROVED ALMOST A

07:20:37.878 --> 07:20:39.179
THOUSAND UNITS WITHIN A HALF

07:20:39.246 --> 07:20:39.713

07:20:39.780 --> 07:20:40.814
STATION.

07:20:40.881 --> 07:20:42.382
AND WHEN THEY WANTED TO DO MORE

07:20:42.449 --> 07:20:43.950
THE REASON WHY THEY COULDN'T DO

07:20:44.017 --> 07:20:45.886
MORE WAS BECAUSE OF PART.

07:20:45.952 --> 07:20:47.420
BART DIDN'T HAVE CLEAR TITLE TO

07:20:47.487 --> 07:20:48.288
ITS OWN PROPERTY IN ORDER FOR

07:20:48.355 --> 07:20:50.023
THEM TO DO IT.

07:20:50.090 --> 07:20:51.491
AND YOU NEED ONLY LOOK AT THE

07:20:51.558 --> 07:20:52.425
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION

07:20:52.492 --> 07:20:54.194
COMMISSION'S OWN REPORT FROM

GOALS TOWARDS HOUSING THE THREE

07:21:02.869 --> 07:21:05.071

07:21:05.138 --> 07:21:06.740
IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE NOT

07:21:07.941 --> 07:21:10.577
FRANCISCO SAN JOSE AND OAKLAND.

STATEMENT AND THIS IS THE REASON

WHY A THIRD OF THE PARK BOARD

MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE.

07:23:54.708 --> 07:23:56.209
AND FOR SHARING MY PASSION OF

07:23:56.276 --> 07:23:57.911
IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE

07:23:57.978 --> 07:23:59.045
FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN THE BAY

07:23:59.112 --> 07:24:00.480
AREA AND THOSE THAT VISIT THE

BAY AREA.

07:24:01.982 --> 07:24:03.683
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE BART

07:24:03.750 --> 07:24:06.086
I GUESS OR ARE FEEL GOOD ON BART

07:24:06.152 --> 07:24:07.954
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS STATE IS

07:24:08.021 --> 07:24:09.489
FACING A HOUSING CRISIS WE

07:24:09.556 --> 07:24:11.124
WORKED VERY HARD LAST YEAR. TO

07:24:11.191 --> 07:24:13.727
POWER TO PASS A HOUSING PACKAGE

07:24:13.793 --> 07:24:15.528
TO ADDRESS THAT CRISIS THAT IS

07:24:15.595 --> 07:24:18.365
OVERWHELMING OUR OUR OUR STATE.

07:24:18.431 --> 07:24:19.299
AND SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE A BIT

07:24:19.366 --> 07:24:21.801
OF A A PERSPECTIVE ABOUT BART

07:24:21.868 --> 07:24:23.670
WHEN IT COMES TO MY CITY --

07:24:23.737 --> 07:24:25.338
WHILE I WAS IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT

07:24:25.405 --> 07:24:26.940
SERVING ON COUNCIL.

07:24:27.007 --> 07:24:29.609
BART SHOWS OUR DOWNTOWN STATION

07:24:29.676 --> 07:24:30.910
AS A PLACE FOR CAPITAL

07:24:30.977 --> 07:24:31.478
IMPROVEMENT AS ONE OF THEIR

07:24:31.544 --> 07:24:32.946
SITES.

07:24:33.013 --> 07:24:34.848
THEY COULD HAVE EASILY COME UP

07:24:34.914 --> 07:24:36.683
WITH THEIR OWN PLANS AND JUST

07:24:36.750 --> 07:24:38.151
RAMMED IT THROUGH BUT INSTEAD

07:24:38.218 --> 07:24:39.252
THEY REACHED OUT THEY

07:24:39.319 --> 07:24:40.620
COLLABORATED THEY SOUGHT FOR

07:24:40.687 --> 07:24:42.022
ADVICE AND INPUT FROM THE CITY

07:24:42.088 --> 07:24:43.423
COUNCIL.

07:24:43.490 --> 07:24:45.191
WE WERE SO CRITICAL WE EVEN WENT

07:24:45.258 --> 07:24:46.192
DOWN TO THAT TYPE OF LIGHT

07:24:46.259 --> 07:24:47.660
STANDARDS THEY WERE GOING TO USE

07:24:47.727 --> 07:24:48.928
ALONG THE SIDEWALK.

07:24:48.995 --> 07:24:50.663
AND BART WILLINGLY MADE THE

07:24:50.730 --> 07:24:52.465
ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR PLANS TO

07:24:52.532 --> 07:24:53.533
ACCOMMODATE THE CITY COUNCIL'S

07:24:53.600 --> 07:24:54.868
REQUEST.

07:24:54.934 --> 07:24:55.969
AND SO THERE IS THAT

07:24:56.036 --> 07:24:58.071
COLLABORATIVE APPROACH BART HAS

07:24:58.138 --> 07:25:00.140
PRODUCED GREAT TEO DE AND OUT

07:25:00.206 --> 07:25:02.575
BUT THERE ARE SOME INCOMPLETE --

07:25:02.642 --> 07:25:03.943
PROJECTS --

07:25:04.010 --> 07:25:05.812
EVEN IN THE PAST TEN YEARS AS MY

07:25:05.879 --> 07:25:06.713
FACT I'D LIKE TO THINK THE

07:25:06.780 --> 07:25:07.647
ARGUMENT --

07:25:07.714 --> 07:25:09.783
THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR HER

07:25:09.849 --> 07:25:12.052
ARGUMENT ABOUT. ONE PARTICULAR

07:25:12.118 --> 07:25:15.121
CITY WHO HAS ALREADY.

07:25:15.188 --> 07:25:16.756
WELL THE GOOD NEWS ON OUR BILL

07:25:16.823 --> 07:25:18.625
IS THAT IF YOU MEET ARENA

07:25:18.691 --> 07:25:20.560
NUMBERS YOU'RE ACTUALLY EXEMPT.

07:25:20.627 --> 07:25:22.362
AND SO IF YOU MEET A MAN IN ALL

07:25:22.429 --> 07:25:23.496
THE DIFFERENT --

07:25:23.563 --> 07:25:25.198
CATEGORIES AND DIFFERENT LEVELS

07:25:25.265 --> 07:25:27.467
SO PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY BUT

07:25:27.534 --> 07:25:29.035
THEY'RE EXPECTED TO TAKE A

07:25:29.102 --> 07:25:30.003
FIFTEEN YEAR AVERAGE FROM THE

07:25:30.070 --> 07:25:31.071
TIME OF NEGOTIATION

07:25:31.137 --> 07:25:33.373
AUTHORIZATION TO COMPLETION.

07:25:33.440 --> 07:25:34.707
AND WE DID TO MAKE IT EASIER TO

07:25:34.774 --> 07:25:36.543
DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND

07:25:36.609 --> 07:25:38.411
BRING OUR HOUSING SUPPLY UP. TO

07:25:38.478 --> 07:25:40.346
BETTER MEET THE DEMAND A KEY

07:25:40.413 --> 07:25:41.714
COMPONENT TO ANY LONG TERM

07:25:41.781 --> 07:25:43.917
SOLUTION FOR A HOUSING NEEDS.

07:25:43.983 --> 07:25:45.151
AND IN THE LARGEST CITY THAT'S

07:25:45.218 --> 07:25:47.454
AND MY DISTRICT THE TOTAL NET

07:25:47.520 --> 07:25:50.290
INCREASE IN THE HOUSING FROM

07:25:50.356 --> 07:25:51.991
200-012-22000 SEVENTEEN WAS A

07:25:52.058 --> 07:25:53.393
HUNDRED NINE UNITS.

07:25:53.460 --> 07:25:54.994
THAT DID NOT QUITE MEET THE

07:25:55.061 --> 07:25:56.396
NEEDS OF HOUSING FOR OUR AREA

07:25:56.463 --> 07:25:58.965
THIS SIMPLY IS UNACCEPTABLE AND

07:25:59.032 --> 07:25:59.532
WE ARE FACING THIS HOUSING

07:25:59.599 --> 07:26:00.567
PRICES.

07:26:00.633 --> 07:26:01.768
AND BY CONNECTING AFFORDABLE

07:26:01.835 --> 07:26:03.169
MAKES USE HOUSING PROJECTS WITH

07:26:03.236 --> 07:26:04.571
CLOSE PROXIMITY AND

07:26:04.637 --> 07:26:05.939
ACCESSIBILITY TO BARK WE ARE

07:26:06.005 --> 07:26:07.540
MOVING THE BAY AREA TOWARDS A

07:26:07.607 --> 07:26:08.141
FUTURE.
