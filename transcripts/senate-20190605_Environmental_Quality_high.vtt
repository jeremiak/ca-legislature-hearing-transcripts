GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS HEARD YOUR

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:51.796

THE RIGHT BALANCE WOULD BE WITH

00:33:52.697 --> 00:33:53.197
THE OPR.

OFFICE AND THE LANGUAGE THE WE

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:08.780

LIKE YOU MENTIONED IS A LOT --

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:14.952
FOR US IS REALLY IT'S NOT REALLY

HAVING IT IN ANOTHER.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:16.554
YOU KNOW BARRIER AND IN THE

00:34:16.621 --> 00:34:17.121
PROCESS OF REALLY HAVING A

00:34:17.188 --> 00:34:17.755
BETTER SENSE OF HOW THE PROCESS

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:20.391
CAN B FACILITATED TO INCLUDE A

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:21.926
LOT OF COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:25.696

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:32.103
BALL TODAY.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:33.371

THAT WAS NEVER REVIEWED BY.

00:34:52.757 --> 00:34:53.524
THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:48.018
THE DEVASTATING CAMPFIRE FROM

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:49.052
LAST YEAR WAS THE MOST

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:50.120
DESTRUCTIVE AND DEADLY FIRE IN

00:49:50.187 --> 00:49:51.655
CALIFORNIA STATE HISTORY.

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:53.690
IT COMPLETELY DESTROYED THE TOWN

00:49:53.757 --> 00:49:54.591
OF PARADISE BY THE POINT UNITS

00:49:54.658 --> 00:49:55.625
BERRIEN SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WITH

00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:56.526

00:49:56.593 --> 00:49:58.862
TOURING THE DEVASTATED TOWN.

LICENSING FIRSTHAND THE

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:02.399
DESTRUCTION OF THAT FIRE HAD

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:02.666
WROUGHT.

00:50:02.733 --> 00:50:03.800
I'LL TELL YOU SOME.

00:50:03.867 --> 00:50:05.535
A FASCINATING STATISTICS ABOUT

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:07.337
THAT FIRE OVER HALF OF THE

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:08.772
STRUCTURES THAT WERE BURNED BY

00:50:08.839 --> 00:50:10.507
THAT FIRE WERE BURNED WITHIN TWO

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:11.675
HOURS OF THE FIRES IGNITION

00:50:11.742 --> 00:50:14.211
THAT'S HOW FAST THAT FIRE SPREAD.

00:50:14.277 --> 00:50:15.612
AND SOME OF THE MOST AMAZING

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.881
TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD WHEN WE

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:18.081
WERE.

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.416
IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE WAS FROM

00:50:19.483 --> 00:50:21.418
THE FIRST RESPONDING AGENCIES

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.754
THEY TOLD US ABOUT COMPLETE

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.223
GRIDLOCK GETTING OUT OF PARADISE

00:50:26.289 --> 00:50:26.490
THAT DAY.

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.758
DICE HAS FOUR DIFFERENT EGRESS

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:29.292
ROUTES AND ALL FOUR OF THEM WERE

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:30.927
COMPLETELY CLOGGED WITH DISABLED

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.162
VEHICLES BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:50:32.229 --> 00:50:34.297
FIRE THAT MOVES THAT QUICKLY.

00:50:34.364 --> 00:50:35.632
OBVIOUSLY WHEN PEOPLE SEE THE

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:36.833
FLAMES ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:37.868
THEY JUST BILLION THEY LEAVE

00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:39.035
THEIR VEHICLES WHERE THEY ARE

00:50:39.102 --> 00:50:40.303
AND SO NO ONE COULD GET OUT

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:41.371
AFTER THAT OCCURRED.

00:50:41.438 --> 00:50:42.973
AND SO WE HAD THE THE HIGHWAY

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:44.474
PATROL AND THE SURE OF TELLING

00:50:44.541 --> 00:50:46.009
US ABOUT PEOPLE SHELTERING IN

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.177
THE MIDDLE OF INTERSECTIONS IN

00:50:47.244 --> 00:50:49.346
THEIR CARS BECAUSE THAT WAS AS

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:50.847
FAR AS THEY CAN GET AWAY FROM.

00:50:50.914 --> 00:50:52.582
OF FLAMMABLE VEGETATION OTHER

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:54.885
OTHER PEOPLE THE TESTIFIED ABOUT

00:50:54.951 --> 00:50:56.219
GOING AND FINDING A MEADOW BUT

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:57.220
THEY COULD SHELTER IN THE MIDDLE

00:50:57.287 --> 00:50:58.588
OF UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THOSE

00:50:58.655 --> 00:50:59.656
PEOPLE SURVIVED IT REALLY

00:50:59.723 --> 00:51:00.557
ILLUSTRATES.

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.691
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE IN

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:04.027
CALIFORNIA WITH LACK OF EGRESS

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:05.462
TO SOME OF OUR MOST FIRE PRONE

00:51:05.529 --> 00:51:06.696
COMMUNITIES.

00:51:06.763 --> 00:51:08.231
OF THIS BILL AB THREE NINETY

00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:09.433
FOUR IS A SMALL RESPONSE TO THAT

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:10.867
IT CRACKED CREATES A VERY

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.203
NARROWLY CRAFTED EXEMPTION TO

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.870
SEE WHAT FOR THE PURPOSE OF

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:14.838
CREATING.

00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:17.641
NEW EGRESS ROUTES OUT OF OUR

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:19.142
COMMUNITIES THE REBEL FIRE PRONE

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:20.310
AND THE DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:21.278
EGRESS.

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:22.712
SO.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.847
WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT FOR OF

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:24.481
PARADISE HAVING FOUR DIFFERENT

00:51:24.548 --> 00:51:25.982
EGRESS ROUTES MANY COMMUNITIES

00:51:26.049 --> 00:51:27.284
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.785
I HAVE FEWER THAN THAT IN FACT I

00:51:28.852 --> 00:51:30.454
LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ONLY

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.455
THREE THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITIES

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.756
WITH ONLY TWO OR ONLY SINGLE

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.090
EGRESS ROUTE AND SO THIS IS

00:51:34.157 --> 00:51:34.658
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE'RE

00:51:34.724 --> 00:51:35.559
TRYING TO STRIKE.

00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:41.398
A VERY APPROPRIATE BALANCE

00:51:41.465 --> 00:51:43.099
BETWEEN TRIED PROTECT THE

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:43.867
ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE PROJECTS

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:44.468

00:51:45.802 --> 00:51:46.303
PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD IN

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:46.937
SOLVING THIS IMPORTANT PROBLEM

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.572
ON THE OTHER HAND SO I DIED

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:49.973
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR AYE

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.944

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:19.703

FRUSTRATION.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.643
BECAUSE I'M A DETAIL GUY AND I

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.011

WE'RE STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:23.700

EGRESS ROUTE.

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:45.088
SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE TYPE OF

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:46.189
EXPEDITED CONSTRUCTION OF THOSE

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:48.325

00:54:06.776 --> 00:54:08.211
USE THAT FOR THESE PURPOSES.

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.913
AND THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION IN

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.948

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:13.783

FORTUNATELY.

00:55:33.863 --> 00:55:35.365
IT WAS STARTED AT THE BOTTOM OF

00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:36.700
THE MOUNTAIN NOT AT THE TOP OF

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.468
THE MOUNTAIN HAD STARTED AT THE

00:55:38.535 --> 00:55:40.003
TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.738
WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE OF

THOUSAND US.

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.379

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:50.547
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR MY

WERE WERE LOST -- THIS THIS IS

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:01.157
GOING TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:02.926
ON THE ABILITY FOR ISOLATED

00:56:02.992 --> 00:56:05.061

I THINK -- OF THOSE THAT MIGHT

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.009
BE CONCERNED ABOUT IS SICK WITH

00:56:20.076 --> 00:56:21.010
EXEMPTION SO WILL UNDERSTAND

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.412
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN

00:56:22.479 --> 00:56:24.047
EMERGENCY SITUATION IN A VERY.

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:26.683
ISOLATED -- AREAS OF THE STATE

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.018
WHICH THERE AREN'T AS A AS MANY.

00:56:29.085 --> 00:56:31.721
AND SO -- I'D BE DELIGHTED TO TO

00:56:31.788 --> 00:56:39.529
MOVE YOUR BILL AND HOPE WE GET A

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:40.463

SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:49.072
EXECUTIVE ORDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:49.906
ISSUED ALLOWS FOR A SECONDARY

00:56:49.973 --> 00:56:52.275
IGRICE ANYWHERE THAT THE FIRE --

00:56:52.342 --> 00:56:54.644
STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND THE FORCE

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:56.646
OF THE PARTNER FOR STREET --

00:56:56.713 --> 00:56:57.380
DETERMINES THEY NEED ONE THIS IS

00:56:57.447 --> 00:56:59.082
THAT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT --

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:00.216
LAST YEAR'S ASSEMBLY WOMAN

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:01.050
FRIEDMAN HAD A BILL THAT

00:57:01.117 --> 00:57:01.618
DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:02.552
FORESTRY TO IDENTIFY FIRE PRONE

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:03.653
COMMUNITIES THAT HAD ONLY A

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.120
SINGLE EGRESS ROUTE.

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:04.754
AND WORK TOWARDS CONSTRUCTING A

00:57:04.821 --> 00:57:05.622
SECOND AND THIS IS INTENDED TO

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.891
BE A FOLLOW ON BILL TO THAT --

00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:08.691
TOO TO ALLOW THE CONSTRUCTION OF

00:57:08.758 --> 00:57:10.894
THAT SECOND ROOM RIGHT BUT BUT

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.694
IT'S MORE THAN THAT BECAUSE

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.763
EXECUTIVE ORDER ALSO ALLOW FOR

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:18.301
THE IMPROVEMENT OF OF EXISTING --

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:20.904
ROADS TO IMPROVE THE THE EGRESS

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.073
AND INGRESS I GUESS ON THOSE CD

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.508
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT PRIDE.

00:57:25.575 --> 00:57:27.143
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND YOUR

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.979
QUESTION SETTLED THE THE LAW OR

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:30.647
GUESS.

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:31.981
OUR STAFF REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THE

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:33.283
LAW IS IS THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:34.918
ALREADY HAS A SECRET EXEMPTION

00:57:34.984 --> 00:57:36.352
TO IMPROVE THE ROADS THAT EXIST

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:38.288
IN THIS HIGH FIRE AREA THANK YOU

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:39.155
WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO THAT

00:57:39.222 --> 00:57:40.790
THEY CAN DO THAT NOW IF THERE'S

00:57:40.857 --> 00:57:42.592
YOU KNOW NARAL NESS AND LIMIT

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.994
LIMITED -- MANEUVERABILITY THEY

00:57:45.061 --> 00:57:46.095
CAN DO THAT RIGHT NOW TO IMPROVE

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:47.230
IT BECAUSE OF THE LESSONS THAT

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.298
WERE LEARNED.

00:57:48.364 --> 00:57:49.432
RIGHT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:50.700
IMPROVEMENT AND THIS RENTALS A

00:57:50.767 --> 00:57:51.601
LITTLE BIT BROADER THAN THAT

00:57:51.668 --> 00:57:53.169
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

00:57:53.236 --> 00:57:54.037
CREATION OF ADDITIONAL EGRESS

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:55.171
RIGHT I'M I'M GETTING THERE I

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.139
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:57:56.206 --> 00:57:58.241
KNOW THAT YOU CURRENTLY RIGHT

00:57:58.308 --> 00:58:05.014
NOW UNDER THE SEAT.

00:58:05.081 --> 00:58:06.683
THAT THE FIRE.

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:07.317
DEPARTMENT FOR SCREEN THE FIRE

00:58:07.383 --> 00:58:08.218
MARSHAL CAN GO IN AND SAY WE

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.552
WANT TO IMPROVEMENTS THAT THESE

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:09.819
EXISTING.

00:58:09.886 --> 00:58:10.820
ROADS WE WANTED IF WE DON'T HAVE

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:11.921
A SECONDARY EGRESS WE WANT TO WE

00:58:11.988 --> 00:58:12.689
WANT TO CREATE A SECONDARY HE

00:58:12.755 --> 00:58:13.756
CHRIS RIGHT SO THAT'S THAT'S

00:58:13.823 --> 00:58:14.791
ALREADY THERE THE GUIDANCE THAT

00:58:14.858 --> 00:58:15.491
WE'VE ADAPTED.

00:58:15.558 --> 00:58:18.061
THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:20.864
OF POTENTIALLY A THIRD FOURTH

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:22.432
ROAD THAT BOYS THAT WOULD

00:58:22.498 --> 00:58:24.267
IMPROVE THE FIRE SAFETY.

00:58:24.334 --> 00:58:28.271
I'M NOT I'M NOT -- DETERMINED

00:58:28.338 --> 00:58:30.840
THAT BUT THAT'S THAT'S SUBJECT

00:58:30.907 --> 00:58:32.275
TO ONE PUBLIC HEARING AND THE

00:58:32.342 --> 00:58:33.977
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THAT --

00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:35.178
SUPPORTER FOR STREET AND THE

00:58:35.245 --> 00:58:36.546
FIRE MARSHAL SET YOUR

00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:37.914
UNDERSTANDING RIGHT CERTAINLY

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:39.349
OUT IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE

00:58:39.415 --> 00:58:42.085
OTHER RESTRICTIONS IN OVERSIGHT

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:43.486
THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE BILL --

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:45.622
BOTH IN THE ASSEMBLY ON HERE SO --

00:58:45.688 --> 00:58:46.923
IT'LL BE SUBJECT ONCE WE GET

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.057
DONE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WILL BE

00:58:48.124 --> 00:58:49.592
SUBJECT TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.361
THAT THE FORCE MANAGEMENT

00:58:51.427 --> 00:58:52.662
PRACTICES SUPPORT.

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.764
JUST THAT -- HAVE BEEN.

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.065
A PROPOSED BY GOVERNMENT NEW

00:58:56.132 --> 00:58:57.000
SUMMERS SERVICES TO ONE OF THE

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.334
CONCERNS THAT -- THAT ONE'S

00:58:58.401 --> 00:59:00.303
CONSTITUENCY HAS IS THAT WE HAVE

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:03.740
FIRE ROADS AND THEY'RE DESIGNED.

00:59:03.806 --> 00:59:04.841
FOR AS WITH THE STATE FIRE ROADS

00:59:04.908 --> 00:59:06.409
THE CONCERN IS THAT IF THOSE GET

00:59:06.476 --> 00:59:12.949
IMPROVE THAT THEY BECOME REGULAR --

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:14.617
THOROUGHFARES IN THE MOUNTAIN

00:59:14.684 --> 00:59:15.351
AREA I MEAN IF.

00:59:15.418 --> 00:59:16.486
A IT MAY IMPROVE IN THE STATE OF

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:17.120
EMERGENCY WITH THERE'S A FIRE

00:59:17.186 --> 00:59:18.821
PEOPLE GETTING OUT THAT'S THAT'S

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:22.325
AND BUT IT ALSO WOULD IMPROVE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:23.626
THE INGRESS AND EGRESS.

00:59:23.693 --> 00:59:25.828
DURING NORMAL TIMES IS IT DO YOU

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:29.332
ANTICIPATE THAT FIRE ROADS UNDER.

00:59:29.399 --> 00:59:30.300
YOUR BILL.

00:59:30.366 --> 00:59:31.901
AND YOUR BILL WOULD BE ABLE TO

00:59:31.968 --> 00:59:34.804
MEET THAT -- IMPROVEMENT --

00:59:34.871 --> 00:59:36.205
CRITERIA WELL I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T

00:59:36.272 --> 00:59:36.940
THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT WAY

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:38.107
SENATOR I'M JUST TRYING TO

00:59:38.174 --> 00:59:39.375
CREATE NEW WAYS OF GETTING

00:59:39.442 --> 00:59:40.810
PEOPLE OUT OF THESE COMMUNITIES

00:59:40.877 --> 00:59:42.612
WHEN WE HAVE THESE DEVASTATING

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:44.514
FIRES THAT ARE SO FAST MOVING.

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:46.449
SO RIGHT THANK YOU SO I I'M I'M

00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:47.684
TRYING TO MAKE A DETERMINED A

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:49.085
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AN

00:59:49.152 --> 00:59:51.688
ADDITIONAL FIRE ROAD THAT'S MADE

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:52.722
FOR IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE

00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:54.490
HERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO GET OUT OF

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.025
THE CANYON OR UP ON THE HILL.

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:58.194
AND IMPROVING BECAUSE AS I CAN

00:59:58.261 --> 00:59:59.896
MAYBE IT'S JUST IMPROVING THE

00:59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.231
EXISTING ACCESS ROAD THAT THERE

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:04.867
WOULD BE A YOU KNOW PAVEMENT OF

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:06.502
ALL HE FIRE ROADS THAT ARE THERE

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:08.304
THAT WEREN'T REALLY DESIGNED FOR

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.306
PEOPLE TO BE ON ALL THE TIME SO.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.041
I DON'T I JUST SPOTTING THE

01:00:12.108 --> 01:00:14.644
ISSUE I'M NOT REALLY SURE --

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.913
WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE GOING TO

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.082
HAVE TO WAIT A MINUTE I'M GONNA

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:19.549
DEFER TO MY EX GREAT?

01:00:19.615 --> 01:00:20.483
SO WITH RESPECT TO THOSE FIRE

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.484
ROADS -- I THINK ONE OF THE

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:22.986
THINGS THE BOARD OF FORESTRY

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:25.388
RECOGNIZED IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.257
HAVE THESE FIRE ROADS -- THEIR

01:00:28.324 --> 01:00:29.692
DIRT ROADS LEADING IN THE MIDDLE

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.260
OF NO WHERE -- THROUGH THE

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:31.928
MIDDLE OF A FOREST IN THE EVENT

01:00:31.995 --> 01:00:34.097
OF A FOREST FIRE AND SO YOU HAVE

01:00:34.163 --> 01:00:35.431
PEOPLE WHO ARE.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:37.166
SCARED AND THEY'RE SCARED TO USE

01:00:37.233 --> 01:00:38.501
THOSE VIRUS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:00:38.568 --> 01:00:40.136
EXACTLY SURE WHERE THEY WILL

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:41.437
LEAD THEM THERE ON IMPROVE

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.172
TOWARDS ARE GOING TO BE --

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.774
CHALLENGES GETTING YOUR CAR OUT

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:46.943
THAT FIRE ROAD THAT YOU WOULDN'T

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:48.177
NECESSARILY HAVE WITH MAYBE.

01:00:48.244 --> 01:00:49.979
A FIRE ENGINE OR SOMETHING SO I

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.681
THINK THIS BILL AND THE BOARD OF

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.716
FORESTRY OR LOOKING AT WAYS TO

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.885
IMPROVE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.187
ABILITY TO USE THOSE FIRE ROADS.

01:00:58.254 --> 01:00:59.622
THAT MIGHT BE PAVING IT MIGHT BE

01:00:59.689 --> 01:01:00.490
REALLY WHATEVER THE BOARD OF

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.025
FORESTRY DETERMINES WOULD MAKE

01:01:02.091 --> 01:01:03.760
THE PUBLIC FEEL SAFER TO USE

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:10.533
THOSE ROAD SUCCESSFULLY IN THE

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:17.140
EVENT OF A FIRE.

01:01:17.206 --> 01:01:18.708
AIM IS CHAIRED FALLING ON THAT.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:19.308
IN THE EVENT OF A FIRE YOU YOU

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:19.709
SAID.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:21.144
THESE WOULD ALSO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:22.011
USE THOUGH NOT IN THE EVENT OF

01:01:22.078 --> 01:01:23.579
FIRE CORRECT [inaudible]

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:26.616
HE'S ROADS.

01:01:26.682 --> 01:01:27.950
SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:01:28.017 --> 01:01:29.986
THE ROADS I DO BELIEVE WOULD

01:01:30.053 --> 01:01:32.588
HAVE TO BE OPEN -- SO YEAH YOU

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:34.190
COULDN'T HAVE CHANGE YOU

01:01:34.257 --> 01:01:36.092
COULDN'T HAVE GATES ACROSS THE

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:36.826
ROADS BECAUSE THAT'S ANOTHER ONE

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:37.627
OF THE THINGS THE BOARD OF

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:39.762
FORESTRY IDENTIFIED AS BEING AN

01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:40.329
IMPEDIMENT.

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:41.964
IF THERE'S YOU KNOW A GATE

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:42.565
ACROSS THE ROAD IT MIGHT BE

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.201
DIFFICULT. TO GET THROUGH IF

01:01:45.268 --> 01:01:47.437
THERE'S A TRAIN IT MIGHT BE

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.905
DIFFICULT TO GET WORSE RIGHT.

01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:51.374
I AM YEAH WE WENT THROUGH WOLSEY --

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:55.311
AND WE WERE LUCKY IN THAT.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.712
SPECIFIC COAST HIGHWAY WHICH

01:01:56.779 --> 01:01:59.615
ENDED UP BECOMING. ONE OF THE

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:02.051
MANY GRASSES -- THE FIRED AND

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:04.220
HIT AT THE SAME TIME EVERYONE

01:02:04.287 --> 01:02:05.354
WAS STUCK ON IT.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:07.457
MY GRANDPARENTS FOR SEVEN HOURS

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.792
SITTING THERE JUST SITTING DUCKS

01:02:09.859 --> 01:02:11.194
BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

01:02:11.260 --> 01:02:15.565
COULD OF BUT THIS CANYON ROADS

01:02:15.631 --> 01:02:17.300
TO AND THAT'S HOW WE LOST PEOPLE

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:19.268
BEEN LEASE MANY.

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.804
ON LOST TO PEOPLE.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:23.873
SHORT TERM RESPIRATORY ANOTHER.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.143
ISSUES BUT TO YEAH THIS GOES

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:31.347
BEYOND -- JUST SIMPLE NO SEEK

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.448
WHAT POLICY IF IT'S EVER

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.117
CONSIDERED SIMPLE INTO LIFE AND

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:35.418
DEATH ISSUE SO I RECOGNIZE THE

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.954
GRAVITY OF THE THE BILL -- IS

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.689
STILL TRYING TO GET I WANT TO

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:40.556

01:02:42.258 --> 01:02:45.261
ALSO -- HOW THE?

01:02:45.328 --> 01:02:46.596
THE TIMBER HARVEST PIECE IS

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:48.364
GOING TO WORK IN RESOURCES I

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.198
KNOW WE'RE DOUBLE REFERRED HERE

01:02:49.265 --> 01:02:51.434
TODAY -- SO I WANT TO TAKE A

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.902
CLOSER LOOK AT ALL THAT BUT I

GET A MORE THOROUGH LOOK AT

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.176
EXACTLY THESE ARE REALLY

01:03:00.243 --> 01:03:02.311
SENSITIVE AREAS IT'S COMPLEX

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.614
CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING ALSO TO

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.781
JUST TO TRY TO GET A BETTER

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.350

DATA NOW.

01:03:43.019 --> 01:03:44.453
SO WE CAN GIVE A REASON LOW

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.522
EXPECTATION LEAST THE PUBLIC.

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:47.156

BEST FORCE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

01:04:02.972 --> 01:04:07.043
AND IN OVERSIGHT.

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.778
THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE I'M SO

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:09.645
UNDER THE BILL AMENDMENTS TAKEN

01:04:09.712 --> 01:04:10.580
AN ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:13.216
COMMITTEE BASICALLY SAY THAT ANY.

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.650
COMMERCIAL TIMBER THAT'S

01:04:14.717 --> 01:04:16.552
HARVESTED HAS TO COMPLY WITH THE

FOREST PRACTICES ACT -- UNDER

01:04:18.054 --> 01:04:19.989
THE SANITY Q. PROPOSED

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:21.724
AMENDMENTS OTHER PROVISIONS THAT

01:04:21.791 --> 01:04:24.093
WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE PROJECT

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.995
AND THE PROJECT APPLICANT TO

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.196
COMPLY WITH BEST.

01:04:27.263 --> 01:04:28.764
PRACTICES AND RAGS TO THAT WERE

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:30.132
ADOPTED UNDER THE FOREST

01:04:30.199 --> 01:04:32.902
PRACTICES ACT -- I THINK ONE OF

01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.037
THE AUTHORS -- INTENSE WAS TO

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.505
CLARIFY THAT THOSE PROVISIONS

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.608
APPLY TO FORESTRY APPLY TO THE

01:04:38.674 --> 01:04:40.910
REMOVAL OF TREES WITH RESPECT TO

01:04:40.977 --> 01:04:41.877
SOME SORT OF WATER COURSES YOU

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:43.179
KNOW THEIR WETLANDS PROTECTIONS

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.413
BUILT INTO THE BILL ALREADY

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:49.819
SPECIES PROTECTIONS CAN'T IMPACT.

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:51.187
LISTED SPECIES -- SO THEIR

01:04:51.254 --> 01:04:52.054
NUMBER PROTECTIONS ALREADY BUILT

01:04:52.121 --> 01:04:53.022
IN THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS WILL

01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.956
STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

01:04:54.023 --> 01:04:56.158
NORMAL CIVIL ENGINEERING PROCESS --

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:58.027
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO

01:04:58.094 --> 01:05:00.062
OBTAIN ANY PERMIT APPROVALS OR

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:02.231
REVIEWS THROUGH STATE WATER

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:04.200
RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD.

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.935
FISH AND WILDLIFE.

01:05:06.002 --> 01:05:07.436
RIGHT AS FAR AS WE CAN GO

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.204
THROUGH ASHA.

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:08.804
I MEAN WITH THE SEEK REVIEW

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:10.039
COULD GO THROUGH ENVIRONMENTALLY

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:11.407
SENSITIVE HABITAT AREAS IN

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.908
THEORY WITHOUT.

01:05:12.975 --> 01:05:15.077
ANY IMMINENT Z. BERG THE THE

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:16.045
WORST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES DON'T

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:19.782
REALLY COVER THOSE THOSE

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:20.349
ENVIRONMENTS THE SAME WAY I

01:05:20.416 --> 01:05:20.983
WOULD.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:21.684
I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:22.718
REGISTERED PROFESSIONAL FORSTER

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.854
ON HOW THE FORCE PRACTICES ACT

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.555
DEALS WITH THOSE BY ABOUT IT I

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:27.757
THINK THE IMPORTANT THING IS

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:28.324
THAT.

01:05:28.391 --> 01:05:29.825
THIS ISN'T NECESSARILY CHANGING

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:31.093
ANY OF THE OTHER SUBSTANTIVE

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:32.395
LAWS THAT ARE OUT THERE WITH

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:33.596
RESPECT TO PROTECTION OF THOSE

01:05:33.663 --> 01:05:35.197
WATER COURSES.

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:37.466
SO IF THERE ARE -- PROTECTIONS

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:38.668
IN THE FISH AND GAME FISH AND

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:40.369
WILDLIFE CODE -- THE DEAL WITH

01:05:40.436 --> 01:05:41.804
THOSE WATER COURSES -- IN THE

01:05:41.871 --> 01:05:44.674
WATER CODE YOU'RE STILL GONNA

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.042
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE. TO

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.576
THEN ARE YOU GONNA HIT IMPASSES

01:05:47.643 --> 01:05:49.178
THAN IN THOSE AREAS.

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.880
WHERE YOU CAN'T ACTUALLY BUILD

01:05:50.946 --> 01:05:52.682
THE EGRESS THAT YOU NEED IF IT

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:54.784
ISN'T ASHA LET'S FLESH THAT OUT

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:57.720

SUBDIVISION BE ELIGIBLE WHO

01:06:09.999 --> 01:06:13.336
MIGHT BE OUT -- SO.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:15.037
IF AND MAYBE EVEN BRINGING DID

YOU GUYS HAVE ANY REPORTS

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:17.406
INITIALLY FROM CAL FIRE ON THIS

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.275
ISSUE OF THE SORT OF STARTED TO

01:06:19.342 --> 01:06:21.210
DO THE ANALYSIS OF WHAT.

FORESTRY STARTING ON THE LIST OF

01:06:26.449 --> 01:06:27.450
PROCESS FOR STREET.

01:06:27.516 --> 01:06:28.317
RIGHT THE BOARD OF FORESTRY ACT

NOT CLEAR HOW MANY COMMUNITIES

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.794
ARE OUT THERE -- THAT WOULD NEED

01:13:41.650 --> 01:13:43.585
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:46.355
REPUBLIC SERVICES -- ME

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:55.397
INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES THANK.

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:56.198
GOOD MORNING CHEN COMMITTEE

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.099
MEMBERS NICK OFFICE OF

01:13:57.166 --> 01:13:58.000
CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE.

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:58.834
THIS BILL IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE

01:13:58.901 --> 01:13:59.501
POLICY WE HAVE EXISTING LAWS ON

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:00.002
THE BOOKS THAT REQUIRE

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:00.636
BUSINESSES TO HAVE RECYCLING AND

01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:02.204
COMPOSTING SERVICE.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.539
THE SIMPLY SAYS THAT A BUSINESS

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.407
THAT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO HAVE

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:07.976
THE SERVICE MUST PROVIDED TO ITS

01:14:08.043 --> 01:14:09.444
CUSTOMERS.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.780
IT REALLY TACKLES TWO SEPARATE

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.715
BUT REALLY IMPORTANT PROBLEMS.

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.450
FIRST IS AS THIS COMMITTEES WALL

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.853
WHERE WE'RE FACING A CRISIS WITH

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.188
OUR RECYCLING MARKETS.

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.589
THE MATERIAL THAT WE USE TO BE

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:21.790
ABLE TO SHIP OVERSEAS WITH

01:14:21.857 --> 01:14:23.692
FAIRLY HIGH CONTAMINANTS.

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.127
I THOSE COUNTRIES NO LONGER WANT

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:28.864
AND THAT'S FORCING US TO RE LOOK

01:14:28.931 --> 01:14:30.599
AT THE ENTIRE CYCLING SYSTEM.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:32.835
PART OF THAT IS THE CHAIRS BILL

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.303
ABOUT PRODUCT REDESIGN.

01:14:34.369 --> 01:14:36.004
AND SOURCE REDUCTION PART OF IT

01:14:36.071 --> 01:14:37.673
IS MARKET DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO

01:14:37.739 --> 01:14:39.474
PART OF IT IS CLEANER SOURCE

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.477
SEPARATION. TO GIVING.

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.213
GIVING CUSTOMERS AND RESIDENTS

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:46.849
IN AND CONSUMERS OPPORTUNITY TO

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.317
PUT THINGS IN SEPARATE BINS.

01:14:48.383 --> 01:14:50.519
BEFORE THEY GET COMMINGLED SO

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:51.820
THAT THE COMMODITIES ARE CLEANER

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.856
THEY'RE EASIER TO SELL THEM MORE

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:55.557
VALUE.

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:56.091
THE SECOND THING THE BILL

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:56.859
ACCOMPLISHES.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:58.660
IS.

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.062
MOVING FORWARD WHERE FOCUS ON

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:01.563
ORGANICS DIVERSION AND

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:02.798
COMPOSTING.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.366
AND AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:05.968
ISSUE IT'S GONNA HAVE A LOT OF

01:15:06.034 --> 01:15:07.736
MULTIPLE FACETS INCLUDING.

01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:08.503
MARKET DEVELOPMENT

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.939
INFRASTRUCTURE AT CETERA.

01:15:11.006 --> 01:15:12.841
BUT A PART OF THAT IS ENSURING

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:15.944
THAT CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS.

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.212
TO ORGANICS RECYCLING.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:19.381
WHERE THEY WORK WHERE THEY GO

01:15:19.448 --> 01:15:21.016
OUT TO EAT WHERE THEY LIVE?

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:21.750
AND THAT IS CONSISTENT ACROSS

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.552
THE BOARD SO THAT YOU SORT F

01:15:23.619 --> 01:15:25.988
GET IN THE HABIT OF A BANANA

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.155
PEEL DOESN'T GO IN THE TRASH

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:27.556
CANS.

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.091
OF ANNA KILL GOES IN THE OTHER

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:29.591
BEEN.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.360
AND UNLESS WE HAVE THAT KIND OF

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.595
CONSISTENT SYSTEM ACROSS THE

01:15:33.662 --> 01:15:35.197
BOARD.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.231
IT JUST WON'T WORK WHEN WE DROP

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.100
OFF BINS OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:38.500
THEY HAVE NO IDEA.

01:15:38.567 --> 01:15:41.670
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM -- THAT

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.604
ASSN AYE BOAT THANK YOU.

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:43.972
MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:45.240
COMMITTEE MARKHAM PRAY OUT WITH

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:46.942
A FRIEND THE KELLY ON BEHALF OF

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:50.178
REPUBLIC SERVICES -- WE ARE ARE

01:15:50.245 --> 01:15:52.014
HAPPY TO SUPPORT BY THIS MEASURE

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.916
AND WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS REALLY

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.350
FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES.

01:15:55.417 --> 01:15:58.587
OPERATIONALLY AND COST PRESSURES.

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.722
AS YOU ARE ALL WELL AWARE --

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.792
CHINA SOARED AND IT'S MUCH LOWER

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:05.227
CONTAMINATION STANDARDS HAVE

01:16:05.294 --> 01:16:07.562
CAUSED A LOT OF SOLID WASTE THAT

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.464
WAS PREVIOUSLY RECYCLED TO BE

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.499
REJECTED.

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:14.069
AND THERE AREN'T MARKETS FOR

01:16:14.136 --> 01:16:15.137
RECYCLED MATERIALS.

01:16:15.203 --> 01:16:18.106
SECONDLY IS THAT IT IS -- AS A

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.975
RESULT OF THAT THERE IS A

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:26.081
PRESSURE -- TO PROVIDE --

01:16:26.148 --> 01:16:31.219
GREATER -- RECYCLED CONTENT

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:32.354
INTERCLUB SKEWS ME.

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.990
THERE IS A IS A GREATER PRESSURE --

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.059
TO LOOK AT PROVIDING THE LESS

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:38.727
CONTAMINATION IN THE BILLS THAT

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:40.028
ARE BEING SOLD.

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:42.397
AND WITH THE ADVENT OF THE

01:16:42.464 --> 01:16:44.800
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTEEN

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:46.335
EIGHTY THREE A NEED TO ADDRESS

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.236
THE ISSUE OR OF ORGANIC

01:16:48.303 --> 01:16:50.505
RECYCLING -- IN TAKING THAT OUT

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:53.075
OF LANDFILLS AS A RESULT THERE

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:54.743
IS INCREASING PRESSURE ON SOLID

01:16:54.810 --> 01:16:56.511
WASTE OPERATORS TO SLOW THE

01:16:56.578 --> 01:16:59.147
SYSTEM WHICH RESULTS IN HIGHER

01:16:59.214 --> 01:16:59.581
COSTS.

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:02.384
IF SOLID WASTE COULD BE A BETTER

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.419
SOURCE SEPARATED THOSE --

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.921
PRESSURES WOULD NOT BE

01:17:05.988 --> 01:17:08.190
ELIMINATED BUT WOULD BE REDUCED

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.058
AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IT FROM

01:17:10.125 --> 01:17:12.561
A STANDPOINT THAT OPERATORS HAVE

01:17:12.627 --> 01:17:14.563
A MUCH GREATER BURDEN IN TERMS

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.498
OF GETTING TO A LOWER --

01:17:16.565 --> 01:17:19.234
CONTAMINATION RATE BUT ALSO AS A

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.203
RESULT OF THAT THEIR HIGHER COST

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.771
PRESSURES OR COMMERCIAL

01:17:22.838 --> 01:17:24.940
CUSTOMERS ON OUR RESIDENTIAL

01:17:25.007 --> 01:17:26.775
CUSTOMERS AND ULTIMATELY ON THE

01:17:26.842 --> 01:17:28.543
MUNICIPALITIES WHO FRANCHISE OR

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:33.882
SOLID WASTE FOR THOSE REASONS

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:37.753
WERE ASKING.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:38.320

WE'RE DEALING WITH ON AND OTHER
