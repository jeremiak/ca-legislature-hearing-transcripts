KALORAMA CHANDRAN I'M A

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.002
PROFESSOR OF LAW AT SOUTHWESTERN

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.637
LAW SCHOOL ALTHOUGH I'M SPEAKING

00:07:51.704 --> 00:07:52.939
ON MY OWN BEHALF NOT ON BEHALF

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:53.773
OF THE LAW SCHOOL --

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.641
I TEACH CONSTITUTIONAL LAW AND

00:07:55.708 --> 00:07:57.009
EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION AND I

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:57.944
SUPERVISE THE NINTH CIRCUIT

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.712
APPELLATE LITIGATION CLINIC --

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:00.713
I BELIEVE THE BILL IS

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.181
CONSTITUTIONAL IT WOULD VERY

00:08:02.248 --> 00:08:03.583
LIKELY WOULD STAND ANY LEGAL

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:04.684
CHALLENGE --

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.751
AND THAT'S BECAUSE STATES HAVE

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:08.821
BROADER USABLE REGULAIONS OF

00:08:08.888 --> 00:08:10.656
BALLOT ACCESS TO CANDIDATES.

00:08:10.723 --> 00:08:11.757
EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:12.725
QUALIFICATIONS --

00:08:12.792 --> 00:08:14.026
LISTED IN THE CONSTITUTION FOR

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:16.629
FEDERAL OFFICE FIRST THE BILL IS

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.864
A REASONABLE REGULATION OF

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.898
BALLOT ACCESS BECAUSE IT

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:19.966
PROMOTES A STATE AND VOTER

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:21.801
INTEREST THAT'S NOT ONLY

00:08:21.868 --> 00:08:23.636
LEGITIMATE IT'S COMPELLING.

00:08:23.703 --> 00:08:24.737
IT DOES SO WITHOUT CREATING ANY

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.706
ONEROUS OBLIGATIONS FOR

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:27.707
COMPLIANCE --

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:28.808
THE INTEREST OF COURSE IS

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.943
INFORMATION FOR VOTERS ABOUT

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.812
CANDIDATES FINANCIAL INTERESTS

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:34.814
AND THAT INTEREST IS PROMOTED

00:08:34.881 --> 00:08:36.649
WITHOUT REQUIRING THE CANDIDATES

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.784
TO FILE EXTREMELY EARLY TOGETHER

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:39.785
LARGE NUMBERS OF PETITION

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:41.621
SIGNATURES OR MOVE THEIR

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:41.954
RESIDENCE --

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.723
IT'S VERY EASY FOR CANDIDATES TO

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.591
COMPLY WITH THE BILL.

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:46.792
SECOND UNLIKE LAWS THAT HAVE

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:48.594
BEEN SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED

00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.629
BECAUSE THEY SEEK TO DISPARAGE

00:08:49.695 --> 00:08:52.632
CANDIDATES WERE MISLEAD VOTERS

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:53.833
SB TWENTY SEVEN DOES NOT PRINT

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.835
ANY INFORMATION MUCH LESS

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:56.936
DISPARAGING OR MISLEADING

00:08:57.003 --> 00:08:58.771
INFORMATION ON THE BALLOT.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:00.806
IT MERELY PLACES THE TAX RETURNS

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.642
ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:03.809
WEBSITE AND VOTERS MAY LOOK UP

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:05.778
OR IGNORE THE INFORMATION AS

00:09:05.845 --> 00:09:06.879
THEY PLEASE --

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:07.747
AS THEY SEE FIT.

00:09:07.813 --> 00:09:09.782
FINALLY THE BILL IS A BALLOT

00:09:09.849 --> 00:09:11.017
ACCESS PROVISION BECAUSE I'D

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:12.051
RATHER THAN AN ADDED

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:13.786
QUALIFICATION FOR OFFICE BECAUSE

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:14.720
THE UNDERLYING DEMOCRATIC

00:09:14.787 --> 00:09:15.922
PRINCIPLE BEHIND THAT

00:09:15.988 --> 00:09:17.957
DISTINCTION IS THAT VOTERS NEED

00:09:18.024 --> 00:09:19.892
TO BE FREE TO CHOOSE CANDIDATES

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:20.927
OF THEIR CHOICE.

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.762
UNLIKE A LAW THAT IMPOSES A TERM

00:09:22.828 --> 00:09:25.665
LIMIT OR A RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:26.832
SB TWENTY SEVEN DOESN'T RESTRICT

00:09:26.899 --> 00:09:28.834
VOTERS CHOICE BECAUSE THERE'S NO

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.202
PERSON WHO THE VOTERS MIGHT WISH

00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:32.805
TO VOTE FOR WHO CANNOT COMPLY.

00:09:32.872 --> 00:09:34.006
WITH THE PROVISION CERTAINLY

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.708
SOME VOTERS MAY BE ON INTERESTED

00:09:35.775 --> 00:09:37.643
IN THE TAX INFORMATION BUT

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.844
THERE'S NO LEGITIMATE VOTER

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.613
INTEREST IN KEEPING THAT

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:41.981
INFORMATION FROM OTHER VOTERS

00:09:42.048 --> 00:09:42.715
WHO ARE INTERESTED.

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:45.718
THERE'S NO INTEREST IN THE

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.721
CANDIDATE NOT PERHAPS HAVING A

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:49.789
POWERFUL INCUMBENT REPRESENT

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:50.723
THEM --

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:52.758
FINALLY BECAUSE THE BILL ONLY

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.660
APPLIES TO PRIMARY ELECTIONS

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:55.795
THERE'S NO CONCERN THAT

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:56.762
CALIFORNIA'S BALLOT WOULD

00:09:56.829 --> 00:09:58.731
UNDERMINE NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:00.633
COUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE IF MR TRUMP

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.868
FAILS TO COMPLY WITH SB TWENTY

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.603
SEVEN AND TWENTY TWENTY AND HE

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.237
DOES NOT APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY

00:10:05.304 --> 00:10:06.739
BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA.

00:10:06.806 --> 00:10:07.807
SO LONG AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.642
NOMINATES HIM HE WILL STILL

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:10.776
APPEAR ON THE GENERAL BALLOT AT

00:10:10.843 --> 00:10:12.645
THEIR FOR THE NATIONAL INTEREST

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.647
IN BEING ABLE TO ASSESS POPULAR

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:15.681
WILL.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:16.916
AND THE GENERAL POPULAR VOTE

00:10:16.983 --> 00:10:18.017
COUNT THAT WOULD NOT BE

00:10:18.084 --> 00:10:18.751
UNDERMINED --

00:10:18.818 --> 00:10:20.720
AT ALL SO IN SOME I BELIEVE THE

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:21.988
BILL VERY LIKELY BE UPHELD IN

00:10:22.054 --> 00:10:23.055
THE COURTS BECAUSE IT PROMOTES

00:10:23.122 --> 00:10:25.691
RATHER THAN UNDERMINING --

00:10:25.758 --> 00:10:26.692
THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTERESTS OF

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.693
VOTERS.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.662
THANK YOU.

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.830
THANK YOU PROFESSOR A COUPLE

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:32.631
QUICK QUESTIONS --

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:35.668
ASSUMING THIS BECOMES LAW AND A

00:10:35.735 --> 00:10:36.836
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DOES NOT

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.771
COMPLY DOES NOT PROVIDE HIS OR

00:10:38.838 --> 00:10:39.972
HER TAX RETURNS SO THEY CAN

00:10:40.039 --> 00:10:41.707
APPEAR ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT BY

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.676
UNDERSTAND YOUR TESTIMONY SORRY.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.845
THE CRACKS BUT THEY DO APPEAR ON

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:46.679
THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT IS

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:46.979
THAT RIGHT.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:48.814
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOMINATES

00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:49.982
THAT PERSON OR THE DEMOCRATIC

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:51.617
PARTY DOES YES THEY WOULD STILL

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.052
DOES THE DOES THE DEMOCRATIC

00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:55.621
PARTY DO THEY HAVE A MECHANISM

00:10:55.688 --> 00:10:56.722
SEPARATE APART FROM.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:58.691
THE PERIOD OF PRIMARY BALLOT TO

00:10:58.758 --> 00:10:59.992
THAT APPEAR ON THE GENERAL

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:01.694
ELECTION BALLOT --

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:03.629
WELL THAT AT TWO MAJOR PARTIES

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:05.031
THEY CHOOSE AT THEIR CONVENTIONS

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:06.899
WHO THEY ARE WHO THEY WILL BE

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:08.601
NOMINATING --

00:11:08.667 --> 00:11:10.803
AND SO THEY INSURE THAT YOU KNOW

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.837
WHOEVER THEY NOMINATED HE

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:13.672
CONVENTION WOULD APPEAR ON THE

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:13.939
GENERAL.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:15.741
THE GENERAL BALLOT JUST FOLKS IN

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:16.742
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SO

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.644
IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VOTE IN THE

00:11:18.711 --> 00:11:19.845
PRIMARY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CAN

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:21.847
NOMINATE A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE.

00:11:21.914 --> 00:11:23.716
IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE --

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:26.652
IT DEPENDS ON THEIR OWN INTERNAL

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:30.723
X. FOR AYE ON THAT BUT SURE

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.891

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:32.191
THIS MOCK.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:32.992
THAT'S RIGHT SAME THING WITH THE

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.593
REPUBLICAN PARTY IRRESPECTIVE OF

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.062
WHOEVER RECEIVES THE MOST VOTES

00:11:36.128 --> 00:11:38.631
IN THE PRIMARY REPUBLICAN PARTY

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:39.632
COURTNEY THEIR OWN RULES IN

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:42.735
CALIFORNIA YOU CAN NOMINATE

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:55.915
FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT RULED ON

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:58.684
ANY SIMILAR PROVISION.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:11:59.919
I'M I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY FEDERAL

00:11:59.985 --> 00:12:00.886
CIRCUIT COURT RULING IN A

00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:01.921
SIMILAR PROVISION THERE IS A

00:12:01.987 --> 00:12:03.789
FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:05.724
ALABAMA THAT UP HELD --

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.626
A BALLOT ACCESS PROVISION WHERE

00:12:07.693 --> 00:12:08.994
ALABAMA REQUIRED A FINANCIAL

00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:10.830
DISCLOSURE STATEMENT THAT

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.731
DISCLOSURE ITSELF WAS NOT BEING

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:13.866
CHALLENGED BUT RATHER THE TIMING

00:12:13.933 --> 00:12:16.635
OF NEEDING TO FILE IT BUT THAT

00:12:16.702 --> 00:12:17.770
THAT WAS UPHELD.

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.705
THAT WAS FOR THE PRESIDENT --

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:21.740
HOT NO THAT WA FOR OUR LOCAL

00:12:21.807 --> 00:12:23.676
ALABAMA OFFICES.

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:24.877
OKAY YEAH OURNOSE FEDERAL

00:12:24.944 --> 00:12:26.645
OFFICE AS I BELIEVE IT --

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:27.913
IT WAS FEDERAL OFFICES I DON'T

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.015
KNOW IF IT WAS FOR PRESIDENT

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.684

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:34.753
WITHIN -- I

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.754
BELIEVE IT WAS NOT APPEALED --

00:12:35.821 --> 00:12:37.790
SO THERE'S JUST A DISTRICT COURT

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:38.958
OPINION ON THAT NOT A CIRCUIT

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:40.826

DISCLOSURE IS THAT ACCURATE.

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:53.806

[inaudible]

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.660
THE HANDOUTS.

00:14:21.727 --> 00:14:23.829
ARE THE FIRST PRESIDENT EVER

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.599
ISSUED ON THIS KIND OF ISSUE AND

00:14:26.665 --> 00:14:28.667
THE LAST.

00:14:28.734 --> 00:14:29.868
ONE THERE WERE NO GOVERNMENT

00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.904
PRINTED BALLOTS UNTIL EIGHTEEN

00:14:31.971 --> 00:14:33.639
NINETY SO THIS COULDN'T COME UP

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:34.907
BUT ONCE THE GOVERNMENT STARTED

00:14:34.974 --> 00:14:36.809
PRINTING BALLOTS.

00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:38.644
THEN THERE ARE CONTROVERSIES

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:39.778
ABOUT WHAT.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:41.680
COULD THE STATE'S DUE TO EXCLUDE

00:14:41.747 --> 00:14:42.681
PEOPLE.

00:14:42.748 --> 00:14:44.883
THE VERY FIRST CASE WAS FROM THE

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.686
MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT IN.

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:48.621
NINETEEN EIGHTEEN IT'S ONLY ONE

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:49.655
PAGE.

00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:51.924
IT HAS NO PRECEDENCE MENTIONED

00:14:51.991 --> 00:14:53.058
IN IT BECAUSE IT WAS A CASE OF

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:54.893
FIRST IMPRESSION THE PERSON HAD

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.762
BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY.

00:14:56.829 --> 00:14:58.731
AND HE WANTED TO RUN IN A

00:14:58.797 --> 00:14:59.898
PRIMARY FOR CONGRESS.

00:14:59.965 --> 00:15:01.734
AND THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.670
SAID UNANIMOUSLY.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:06.672
THE STATE CAN.

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:09.675
KEEP THEM OFF THE BALLOT.

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:13.679
THE LAST ONE WHICH IS FOUR PAGES.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:15.681
IS ALSO BY COINCIDENCE FROM THE

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:16.682
MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT.

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:18.684
THERE WAS A DENTIST.

00:15:18.751 --> 00:15:20.686
IN SAINT PAUL.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.689
WHO SET FIRE TO HIS OWN OFFICE?

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:25.691
AND TO AVOID PROSECUTION HE FLED

00:15:25.758 --> 00:15:27.693
TO ROME ITALY.

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.927
AND HE HAD FILED FOR CONGRESS

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:29.695
[inaudible]

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.665
AND HE WAS ON THE BALLOT AND

00:15:32.731 --> 00:15:33.599
THEN THE SECRETARY OF STATE TOOK

00:15:33.666 --> 00:15:34.667
HIM OFF.

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.001
BECAUSE HE SAID HE COULDN'T

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:38.737
POSSIBLY SERVICE ELECTED IF HE

00:15:38.804 --> 00:15:40.005
SET FOOT IN THE STATE HE'LL BE

00:15:40.072 --> 00:15:40.673
ARRESTED.

00:15:40.739 --> 00:15:42.107
BUT THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:43.609
SAID [inaudible]

00:15:43.676 --> 00:15:45.678
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:48.714
THE STATE CAN'T CONTROL WHO GETS

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.717
ON THE BALLOT FOR FEDERAL OFFICE --

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.786
OF COURSE THE STATE'S CONTROL

00:15:53.852 --> 00:15:54.853
FILING FEES.

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.922
AND PETITIONS BECAUSE IT'S A

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.691
NECESSITY.

00:15:58.757 --> 00:16:00.726
BUT THEY DO THAT BECAUSE

00:16:00.793 --> 00:16:01.794
OTHERWISE THE ELECTION

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:03.862
ADMINISTRATORS COULDN'T RUN THE

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:05.798
ELECTION BUT THAT'S IT.

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:07.966
AND THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS SPOKEN

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:09.635
ABOUT THAT [inaudible]

00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:11.637
IN --

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:14.740
SCHAEFER VERSUS TOWNSON THEY

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:15.941
SAID THE TERM LIMITS COURT.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.844
REJECTED SUCH A BROAD READING OF

00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:20.746
THE ELECTIONS CLAUSE AND HELD

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:24.683
THE BALANCING TEST IN APPLICABLE.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.852
WHERE THE CHALLENGE PROVISION

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.654
SUPPLEMENTED THE QUALIFICATIONS

00:16:28.721 --> 00:16:29.688
CLAUSE?

00:16:29.755 --> 00:16:30.789
AND DID NOT REGULATE A

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:33.792
PROCEDURAL ASPECT OF AN ELECTION

00:16:33.859 --> 00:16:35.928
OR REQUIRE A CANDIDATE TO SHOW A

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:39.665
MINIMUM LEVEL SUPPORT.

00:16:39.732 --> 00:16:40.632
NOW WHETHER YOU SO YOUR TAX

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.634
RETURNS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:44.703
ELECTION ADMINISTRATION BUT THE

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.839
STATE'S POWER STOPS WITH

00:16:46.905 --> 00:16:49.675
ELECTION ADMINISTRATION.

00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.744
AND I WANT TO SAY IS IMPORTANT

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:52.678
IS THIS ISSUE IS THE SOMETHING

00:16:52.745 --> 00:16:54.680
FAR MORE IMPORTANT.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:56.682
THE ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION THE

00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:57.683
MOST RADICAL.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.818
DEMOCRATIC ASPECT OF THE

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.653
ORIGINAL CONSTITUTION WAS IT

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.088
ANYBODY AGE TWENTY FIVE WHO IS A

00:17:03.155 --> 00:17:04.690
CITIZEN.

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.825
COULD RUN FOR THE HOUSE THAT WAS

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:08.861
SHOCKING BACK THEN ALL THE STATE

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.763
SAID TO BE IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:12.664
YOU HAD YOU HAD ON PROPERTY.

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:15.701
AND THEY'RE EVEN ISN'T SEARCH --

00:17:15.768 --> 00:17:17.836
STILL SOME STATES SAID SEARCH

00:17:17.903 --> 00:17:19.805
STATE SEARCHESAND THERE ARE

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.673
EVEN SOME RELIGIOUS TEST.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.642
SO THE PEOPLE IN THE NINETEENTH

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:24.877
CENTURY WERE VERY PROUD OF THIS

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:26.779
AND VERY AWARE OF IT AND JOSEPH

00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:27.846
STORY WROTE ABOUT IT.

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:29.848
AND THAT'S WHY IN MY LETTER TO

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:30.883
EACH ONE OF YOU.

00:17:30.949 --> 00:17:32.885
I FOUND TWELVE CASES ON WHETHER

00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:34.953
CRIMINALS COULD RUN FOR FEDERAL

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.822
OFFICE AND THEY'RE ALL UNANIMOUS

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:40.659
THERE WAS NOT A SINGLE DESCENT.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:47.666
SO I'LL STOP THERE.

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:52.638
THEY STAY HERE --

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:54.072
OKAY WHATEVER YOU CHOOSE I'D

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:57.643
LIKE TO THINK OF ANY QUESTIONS

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:58.710

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:04.817
PROGRESS THIS YEAR TOO BAD WE

00:18:04.883 --> 00:18:05.784
ACTUALLY HAVE TO RUN THIS

00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:07.686
LEGISLATION AT ALL.

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.720
AND WE CAN'T JUST.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:10.889
RESOLVE THIS LIKE EVERY OTHER

00:18:10.956 --> 00:18:12.791
NORMAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE

00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:13.759
HAS DONE.

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:14.626
AND WE'LL SEE WHAT THE HOUSE

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:17.629
ACTUALLY DOES HERE TO YOU BRING

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.031
IN PERSISTING BRAINY ISSUE FOR

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:20.666
THEY JUST WANNA GIVE.

00:18:20.732 --> 00:18:21.266
I'M SORRY I MISSED YOUR NAME

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.668
PROFESSOR.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:25.637
RAMACHANDRAN RAMACHANDRAN --

00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:27.673
THE EIGHT JUST COMMENTING ON

00:18:27.739 --> 00:18:29.608
SORT OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN --

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:32.611
THIS KIND OF QUALIFICATION OR

00:18:32.678 --> 00:18:33.979
SORT OF PROCEDURAL STEP THAT YOU

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:36.648
THAT THIS BILL WOULD TAKE VERSUS

00:18:36.715 --> 00:18:37.816
SAY A PROPERTY OWNERSHIP

00:18:37.883 --> 00:18:39.852
REQUIREMENT HOW DO YOU SEE THAT

00:18:39.918 --> 00:18:41.854
THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DISTINCTION

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.755
IN TERMS OF THIS BEING A PURELY

00:18:43.822 --> 00:18:44.756
PROCEDURAL --

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:46.892
QUALIFICATION IN NATURE TO TO

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:48.727
SATISFY SOME OF THESE TERM

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:49.928
LIMITS CONCERNS AND THINGS LIKE

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:50.128
THAT.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:52.631
THE MAIN DISTINCTION I WOULD SEE

00:18:52.698 --> 00:18:52.931
IS THAT --

00:25:57.956 --> 00:25:58.957
IF HALF OF THEM --

00:25:59.024 --> 00:25:59.824
OF SOME AHEAD.

00:25:59.891 --> 00:26:01.693
OFTHOSE TWO THOUSAND COMPLAINTS

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.628
WERE ANY OF THEM DETERMINE TO BE

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:04.663
UNFOUNDED IN OTHER WORDS THAT

00:26:04.729 --> 00:26:05.964
THERE WASN'T EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT

00:26:06.031 --> 00:26:06.865
THE ALLEGATION [inaudible]

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:07.666
YES.

00:26:07.732 --> 00:26:10.702
ANY SENSE OF HOW MANY --

00:26:10.769 --> 00:26:13.705
I WOULD SAY IN THE HUNDREDS --

00:26:13.772 --> 00:26:14.940
BUT I'M SURE THAT'S NOT VERY

00:26:15.006 --> 00:26:16.675
HELPFUL.

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.644
BUT BUT IT'S IT'S BUT WE WE

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.012
GENERALLY GET COMPLAINTS WERE

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:23.715
PEOPLE ARE SOMETIMES FILED ON

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:24.783
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THEY DON'T

00:26:24.849 --> 00:26:25.750
UNDERSTAND THE LAW --

00:26:25.817 --> 00:26:29.654
OR THEY BELIEVE ARE THERE IS

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:30.622
FORMAT --

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:31.656
WHEN WHEN REALLY THE PULLOVER

00:26:31.723 --> 00:26:32.757
FORMAT DOESN'T COVER WHAT IT IS

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:34.059
THAT THEY THEY THOUGHT THE

00:26:34.125 --> 00:26:35.727
VIOLATION WAS --

00:26:35.794 --> 00:26:37.762
ONE EXAMPLE IS WE WE WE GET A

00:26:37.829 --> 00:26:39.698
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS --

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:40.865
BY SIGNIFICANT I MEAN --

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:43.702
IS NOT INSIGNIFICANT --

00:26:43.768 --> 00:26:44.903
COMPLAINTS FROM VOTERS WHO

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.671
BELIEVE THAT IF THERE'S A LYING

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:48.840
IN AN AD THAT THAT'S A VIOLATION

00:26:48.907 --> 00:26:49.908
OF POLITICAL REFORM ACT --

00:26:49.975 --> 00:26:51.710
BUT LYING IS NOT --

00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:54.612
ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES --

00:26:54.679 --> 00:26:55.647
AND IN REGARDS TO POLITICAL

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.748
ADVERTISING AND SO --

00:26:56.815 --> 00:26:57.749
WE HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT'S NOT

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.651
SOMETHING I'M OR THEY BELIEVE

00:26:59.718 --> 00:27:01.019
THAT THEIR THAT THE DISCLOSURE

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:02.654
IS INCORRECT AND RELATE IS

00:27:02.721 --> 00:27:04.856
CORRECT BECAUSE THEY DISCLOSURE

00:27:04.923 --> 00:27:06.725
LAWS ARE QUITE COMPLEX NOW --

00:27:06.791 --> 00:27:07.993
SO THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

00:27:08.059 --> 00:27:09.928
EXAMPLES OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE

00:27:09.995 --> 00:27:10.895
GET THAT THAT ARE SOMETIMES ON

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:12.664
FOUNDED.

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:14.766
ALL RIGHT I THINK WHAT YOU SAID

00:27:14.833 --> 00:27:16.634
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS

00:27:16.701 --> 00:27:17.602
THAT WERE FOUND TO BE UNFOUNDED

00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:19.671
RIGHT.

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:20.638
OKAY IN IN ANY OF THOSE

00:27:20.705 --> 00:27:21.906
COMPLAINTS THAT WERE FOUND TO BE

00:27:21.973 --> 00:27:24.676
UNFOUNDED WAS ANYBODY FIND.

00:27:24.743 --> 00:27:26.111
NO WE DON'T FIND PEOPLE ON ON

00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:30.648
FOUND COMPLAINTS --

00:27:30.715 --> 00:27:33.785
SO IT IN TERMS OF THE BILL OF SB

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:34.819
SEVENTY ONE HOW WOULD IT WORK

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:36.788
WITH RESPECT TO INDEPENDENT

00:27:36.855 --> 00:27:38.690
EXPENDITURE COMMITTEES.

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:40.792
WHAT WOULD APPLY TO IT?

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:42.127
WHAT AND APPENDIX MANAGEMENT IS

00:27:42.193 --> 00:27:43.862
A COMMITTEES THAT MAKE

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:45.030
INDEPENDENT EXPENDITURES I JUST

00:27:45.096 --> 00:27:46.698
WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE OUR?

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:49.667
BUT WHAT WHAT WE BREAK IT DOWN

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:50.068
BOTH WAYS OKAY --

00:27:50.135 --> 00:27:52.037
WATER. FOR COMMITTEES AND MAKE

00:27:52.103 --> 00:27:53.038
INDEPENDENCE MANAGERS IT WOULD

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:54.739
IT WOULD APPLY TO THEM --

00:27:54.806 --> 00:27:55.707
AND THAT --

00:27:55.774 --> 00:27:59.611
IF IF THEY WANTED TO USE TO

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:00.979
DEFEND AGAINST A CLAIM --

00:28:01.046 --> 00:28:02.614
OF UNLAWFUL PRACTICES UNDER FEE

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.716
HOW THAT THAT WE WERE UNDER THE

00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:05.250
SPELL THAT WOULD NOT BE

00:28:05.316 --> 00:28:05.750
PERMITTED.

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:06.918
TO SO SO WHO WOULD.

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.754
WHO WOULD PAY SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:10.688
COUNCIL?

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:11.956
OR HOWWOULD THAT BE PAID MORE

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.825
APPROPRIATELY THE PERSON WHO

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:16.661
WOULD BE --

00:28:16.728 --> 00:28:17.262
LIKELY THAT THE THE SUBJECT OF

00:28:17.328 --> 00:28:19.631
THE CLAIM.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:20.632
SO FOR EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THE

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:21.833
COMMITTEES THE SUBJECT THE CLAIM

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.668
THAT THE COMMITTEE IS NAMED

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:26.671
BASED ON SOME VIOLATION OF FEE

00:28:26.738 --> 00:28:27.672
HA.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:27.839
SO.

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:29.707
SOMEBODY WOULD NEED TO SPEND

00:28:29.774 --> 00:28:30.809
PERSONAL FUNDS RIGHT. TO TO

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.711
DEFEND THE ACTION --

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:36.848
I GUESS I HAVE TO A I HAVE TO A

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.650
CLARITY FROM YOU.

00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:39.684
MISTER CHAIR ABOUT HOW A

00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.853
COMMITTEE COULD BE BROUGHT

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.655
AGAINST A CLAIM --

00:28:43.721 --> 00:28:45.857
BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.125
YOU WOULD NEED A PERSON TO

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:49.627
VIOLATE AND I'M AWFUL PRACTICE

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:50.762
OF THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING

00:28:50.829 --> 00:28:51.763
ACT.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.897
WELL THE SO YOU COULD BRING A

00:28:52.964 --> 00:28:55.633
CLAIM OF FEE HOW CLAIM AGAINT

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.668
AND AND A BUSINESS FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:56.734 --> 00:28:58.770
RIGHT -- YOU

00:28:58.837 --> 00:29:00.805
DON'T HAVE TO LOOK INTO THAT --

00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:02.874
BUT BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIM

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:04.676
WOULD BE AGAINST LIKELY I'M A

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:04.943
MANAGER.

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:06.711
MAKING A DECISION --

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.646
ON BEHALF OF THAT ORGANIZATION

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:10.715
AND IT'S THE MANAGER THAT THE

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:11.649
CLAIM WILL BE BROUGHT AGAINST

00:29:11.716 --> 00:29:11.850
OKAY.

00:29:11.916 --> 00:29:13.618
ASSEMBLY IS NOT BROUGHT AGAINST

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:14.786
THE MANAGERS BROUGHT AGAINST THE

00:29:14.853 --> 00:29:15.920
COMMITTEE JUST LIKE --

00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:16.855
AGAINST THE BUSINESS.

00:29:16.921 --> 00:29:18.123
WOULD WOULD EACH CONTRIBUTOR BE

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:22.660
REQUIRED TO USE THE AND IT.

00:29:22.727 --> 00:29:23.328
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION

00:29:23.394 --> 00:29:24.729
CENTER -- I

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:26.631
DON'T THINK CAN INDIVIDUAL

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:28.633
CONTRIBUTORS ARE.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:29.901
OB CAPTURED IN THIS BILL I THINK

00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.669
IT WOULD BE THE LIKELY THE

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.671
CAMPAIGN MANAGER --

00:29:33.738 --> 00:29:35.673
OR OR PERSON.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.008
WHO MADE THAT EMPLOYMENT

00:29:37.075 --> 00:29:39.677
DECISION?

00:29:39.744 --> 00:29:40.778
IN ONE OF ITS BROUGHT AGAINST

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:42.747
THE THE POLITICAL PARTY SO FOR

00:29:42.814 --> 00:29:43.882
EXAMPLE LET'S SAY THERE'S A

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:45.617
CLAIM AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:48.686
PARTY ITSELF.

00:29:48.753 --> 00:29:49.821
HOW WOULD THAT WORK THE DATE IS

00:29:49.888 --> 00:29:51.756
I UNDERSTAND THE BILL THAT THE

00:29:51.823 --> 00:29:54.726
PARTY COULD NOT USE --

00:29:54.792 --> 00:29:56.794
CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS TO DEFEND

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:58.696
ITSELF THE RIGHT --

00:29:58.763 --> 00:30:00.865
THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT INTO THE

00:30:00.932 --> 00:30:02.000
BILL BUT AGAIN WE HAVE TO GO

00:30:02.066 --> 00:30:03.735
BACK -- TO

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:05.737
BUT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO MADE THAT

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:08.640
EMPLOYMENT THAT EITHER HARASSING --

00:30:08.706 --> 00:30:10.842
ACTION OR DISCRIMINATORY ACTION --

00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:12.677
THEY WOULD BE THE ONES WHO WOULD

00:30:12.744 --> 00:30:13.978
BE PERSONAL LIABLE FOR TO PAY

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.680
THOSE LEGAL COSTS.

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:17.148
I UNDERSTAND BUT IF IS BROUGHT

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.683
AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:20.718
PARTY AS WELL FOR EXAMPLE FOR

00:30:20.785 --> 00:30:20.985
FAILURE.

00:30:21.052 --> 00:30:22.987
TO ADEQUATELY SUPERVISE HOW DOES

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:24.722
THAT WORK HOW DOES IT WORK FOR

00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:26.791
THE PARTY TO PAY FOR ITS DEFENSE.

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:28.860
OUTSIDE OF CAMPAIGN

00:30:28.927 --> 00:30:29.894
CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:30:29.961 --> 00:30:31.663
FROM WHAT YOU KNOW I THINK

00:30:31.729 --> 00:30:33.731
PARTIES ARE A A UNIQUE --

00:30:33.798 --> 00:30:34.832
ENTITY AND THAT I THINK THERE --

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:37.635
THEY DO HAVE --

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.604
LOOK INTO IT BUT I THINK IT'S

00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.738
POSSIBLE FOR COMMITTEE OR

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:41.906
PARTIES TO HAVE FUNDS THAT ARE

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.808
OUTSIDE OF CAMPAIGN.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:44.676
CONTRIBUTIONS.

00:30:44.742 --> 00:30:46.744
BUT THERE ARE OTHER REVENUES

00:30:46.811 --> 00:30:47.712
THAT THAT --

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:49.047
POTENTIALLY COULD BE USED

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.848
WHETHER IT'S INTERESTS ARM OFF

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:53.851
OF THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS OR OR

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:54.719
OTHER --

00:30:54.786 --> 00:30:56.120
OTHER DONATIONS THAT ARE NOT

00:30:56.187 --> 00:30:57.922
CONTRIBUTIONS BUT I'LL HAVE TO

00:30:57.989 --> 00:30:58.990
LOOK INTO AND GET BACK TO YOU.

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.758
I'M NOT AWARE OF CONTRIBUTIONS

00:31:00.825 --> 00:31:01.859
TO POLITICAL PARTIES THAT ARE

00:31:01.926 --> 00:31:03.828
NOT CONTRIBUTIONS AGAIN I I CAN

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:05.630
GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT YEAH AND

00:31:05.697 --> 00:31:05.897
IF I MAY.

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:08.032
MY MY THOUGHT IS IF YOU HAVE

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.834
SOMEONE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:12.870
WHO IS ACCUSED OF HARASSMENT.

00:31:12.937 --> 00:31:15.640
AND THE PERSON GOES AFTER THEM

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:16.808
AND THEY TRY TO GO AFTER THE

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:19.711
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THERE WOULD BE

00:31:19.777 --> 00:31:20.678
NO MONEY FOR THEM TO GO AFTER.

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:22.847
BECAUSE OF THIS BILL SAYS THIS

00:31:22.914 --> 00:31:23.748
IF BILL THIS BILLS AND LAW IT

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.850
SAYS YOU CAN'T USE THE MONEY TO

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.819
DEFEND YOURSELF THERE'S NO MONEY

00:31:27.885 --> 00:31:28.953
FOR THEM TO GO AFTER THERE WOULD

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.855
BE NO WAY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.690
PARTY TO PAY FOR IT.

00:31:32.757 --> 00:31:34.826
WELL SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.661
JUDGMENT AGAINST DEMOCRATIC

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:37.829
PARTY AND THEY OWN REAL ESTATE.

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.030
COULDN'T SOMEBODY LEVY AGAINST

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:41.666
THAT REAL ESTATE.

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.900
I DON'T KNOW DO WE OWN PARTNER

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:43.668
ON PROPERTY.

00:31:43.735 --> 00:31:45.737
BUT I DO SEE THERE'S NO THERE

00:31:45.803 --> 00:31:46.804
WOULD BE NO MONEY THAT THIS IS

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.806
ABOUT THIS THIS BILL IS ABOUT

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.876
GOING AFTER PEOPLE ELECTED LIKE

00:31:51.943 --> 00:31:53.811
US IN THIS ROOM THAT DO THINGS

00:31:53.878 --> 00:31:55.046
THAT THEY SHOULDN'T DO THAT ARE

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:55.847
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:57.882
AND THEIR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:59.651
SHOULD NOT BE THERE AS A SLUSH

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:02.720
FUND FOR THEM TO GRAB AND USE TO

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:03.755
PER -- TO

00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:05.723
PROMOTE THAT BAD BEHAVIOR OR

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.625
DEFEND THAT BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:09.661
I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS LOOK FOR A

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:13.665
WAY TO TO FROM NOT DO SOMETHING.

00:32:13.731 --> 00:32:14.265
BUT THIS IS TRYING TO PREVENT

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.633
SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:17.802
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND WE AS

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:18.903
ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE NOT ABOVE

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.872
THE LAW WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

00:32:20.938 --> 00:32:22.774
USE OUR CAMPAIGN FUNDS FOR OUR

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.841
BAD BEHAVIOR.

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:24.742
I THINK YOUR QUESTIONS ARE ALL

00:32:24.809 --> 00:32:25.977
LEGITIMATE I THINK WE CAN GET

00:32:26.044 --> 00:32:27.045
YOU THE ANSWERS THAT YOU NEED

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:28.880
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY DO WE

00:32:28.946 --> 00:32:29.847
WANT TO DO SOMETHING OR DO WE

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:32.684
WANT TO FIND A WAY NOT TO DO IT.

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.951
SO LET ME LET ME JUST CONTINUE

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.019
WITH MISS OUT ON HERE A FEW MORE

00:32:35.086 --> 00:32:35.720
QUESTIONS SO.

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.655
LET ME GIVE YOU A HYPOTHETICAL

00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:40.725
SO A VOLUNTEER ON A CAMPAIGN IS

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.694
POSTING LAWN SIGNS.

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.661
IN THEIR DRIVING IN THEIR

00:32:43.728 --> 00:32:45.663
INVOLVED AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.098
THE PERSON WHO WAS INJURED IN

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:48.700
THE AUTO RELAX AND SUSE THAT

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:50.635
CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEER IN THE

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:50.902
CAMPAIGN.

00:32:50.968 --> 00:32:53.771
COULD THE CANDIDATE USE CAMPAIGN

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:58.676
FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF.

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:03.648
UNDER THAT SCENARIO --

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:05.750
YEAH THAT'S AN INTERESTING

00:33:05.817 --> 00:33:07.018
QUESTION ON WHETHER THEY USE

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.686
CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND.

00:33:08.753 --> 00:33:11.656
AGAINST THE POTENTIAL NEGLIGENCE

00:33:11.723 --> 00:33:13.624
CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A VOLUNTEER

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:14.659
CORRECT --

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:16.761
I'M NOT SURE WE'VE I'VE SEEN

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:17.795
THAT SCENARIO --

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:19.831
I THINK THAT WITH SOMETHING THAT

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:21.632
THEY HAVE TO ASK OUR LEGAL

00:33:21.699 --> 00:33:22.600
DIVISION FOR ADVICE OF WHETHER

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:23.901
NOT THAT THE PROPER USE OF

00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:24.802
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:26.771
AND I BELIEVE MOST OF US ARM HAD

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.773
INSURANCE FOR THAT WHEN WE RAN

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.641
OUR CAMPAIGN SO PROBABLY THE

00:33:30.708 --> 00:33:32.677
INSURANCE IS WHAT WE WOULD USE.

00:33:32.744 --> 00:33:33.611
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION

00:33:33.678 --> 00:33:35.613
IT COULD YOU USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.881
FOR EXAMPLE THE TO INSURE

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.616
AGAINST.

00:33:38.683 --> 00:33:40.918
OF FOR EXAMPLE A WRONGFUL DEATH

00:33:40.985 --> 00:33:42.620
ACTION DO YOU KNOW.

00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:43.788
THE W. PROHIBITED USE OF

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:45.690
CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:47.625
UP PURCHASING INSURANCE I I IS

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:52.663
IS A PERMITTED USE --

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.633
IN OUR MANUAL WE DISCUSS --

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.835
HEALTH INSURANCE OF VEHICLE

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:58.803
INSURANCE --

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.606
WRONGFUL DEATH INSURANCE IS NOT

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:02.774
SOMETHING THAT I'VE I'VE READ IN

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:03.908
OUR MANUAL SO AGAIN THAT WOULD

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.009
BE SOMETHING SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:05.843
TO ASK OUR LEGAL DIVISION.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.879
I DON'T I DON'T THINK YOU CAN

00:34:07.945 --> 00:34:08.880
HELP ME OUT HERE I DON'T THINK

00:34:08.946 --> 00:34:10.815
YOU CAN SURE AGAINST.

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:14.652
INTENTIONAL ACTS SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:18.723
YOU CAN'T BUY INSURANCE. TO

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:19.824
AGAINST AN INTENTIONAL ACT OF

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:20.892
SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:34:20.958 --> 00:34:24.796
IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING. FIVE

00:34:24.862 --> 00:34:26.697
I'VE NOT HEARD OF AN INSURANCE

00:34:26.764 --> 00:34:27.698
POLICY OF THAT TYPE.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.834
SO IF A CANDIDATE FOR EXAMPLE

00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:32.670
LET'S JUST ASSUME.

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:33.237
THAT AND I TAKE YOUR POINT

00:34:33.304 --> 00:34:34.839
CENTER LEYVA THAT THIS BILL IS

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.607
FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO HAVE

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:37.675
COMMITTED THE ACTS.

00:34:37.742 --> 00:34:38.943
THAT THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:40.678
PUNISH THOSE WHO.

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:41.813
HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:42.747
FULL.

00:34:42.814 --> 00:34:44.682
RIGHT SO.

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.685
IF IF FOR EXAMPLE AT A CANDIDATE.

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.020
HAS DONE NOTHING WRONG

00:34:49.086 --> 00:34:49.887
[inaudible]

00:34:49.954 --> 00:34:51.689
NOTHING WRONG.

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.024
OKAY LET'S JUST ASSUME THAT FOR

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.692
THIS HYPOTHETICAL.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.027
BUT IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DONE

00:34:56.093 --> 00:34:57.695
SOMETHING WRONG.

00:34:57.762 --> 00:34:59.730
THAT CAN BE COULD NOT USE

00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:00.932
CAMPAIGN FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:03.668
IS THAT RIGHT.

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:06.737
IN THIS IN IN THE SCENARIO OF A

00:35:06.804 --> 00:35:08.706
FEE HA VIOLATION RIGHT --

00:35:08.773 --> 00:35:10.675
THAT IS THAT IS CORRECT.

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:11.909
SO FOR EXAMPLE --

00:35:11.976 --> 00:35:14.011
LET LET'S SAY THE CANDIDATE HAS

00:35:14.078 --> 00:35:16.714
A BATHROOM IS NOT ADA COMPLIANT

00:35:16.781 --> 00:35:19.717
THEN GETS SUED FOR FAILURE TO

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:20.852
COMPLY WITH THE ADA.

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:22.687
THEN THAT CANDIDATE COULD NOT

00:35:22.753 --> 00:35:24.722
USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS THAT IS

00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:25.923
DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.825
DELEGATION OF HAVING A BATHROOMS

00:35:27.892 --> 00:35:30.695
NOT ADA COMPLIANT IS THAT THAT.

00:35:30.761 --> 00:35:31.662
YOU UNDERSTANDING.

00:35:31.729 --> 00:35:33.097
BUT THAT WOULD BE AN EIGHTY A

00:35:33.164 --> 00:35:34.732
VIOLATION I DON'T KNOW IF THAT

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:35.800
WOULD FALL UNDER A VIOLATION OF

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.768
THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AT

00:35:37.835 --> 00:35:39.003
WELL I THINK THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.705
HOUSING AYE PROTECTS --

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:42.707
AGAINST DISCRIMINATION BASED ON

00:35:42.773 --> 00:35:44.609
PHYSICAL DISABILITY IS AS WELL

00:35:44.675 --> 00:35:46.677
DOESN'T -- I

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:48.913
BELIEVE SO YEAH BUT IT IN YOUR

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.014
SCENARIO YOU BROUGHT UP A

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:50.915
VIOLATION OF THE AMERICAN

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.683
DISABILITIES ACT INSIDE AND IT I

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:53.818
GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHERE THE

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:56.687
CLAIM.

00:35:56.754 --> 00:35:57.855
WELL THAT WAS A YEAR OF FEE HOW

00:35:57.922 --> 00:35:59.624
CLAIMS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.892
WITH THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:02.760
ACT THAT THEN CAN THEY COULD NOT%

00:36:02.827 --> 00:36:02.960
USE.

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:05.062
FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF IS THAT

00:36:05.129 --> 00:36:08.666
RIGHT -- I

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:11.602
BUT I BELIEVE SO YES ALL RIGHT.

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.737
SO LET'S SAY.

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:15.640
THE OF VOLUNTEER COMES IN ONCE

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:17.708

EXAMPLE HAS SOME SORT OF EITHER

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:20.845
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:22.847
THAT PRECLUDES THEM FROM BEING

00:36:22.914 --> 00:36:24.682
ABLE TO TALK TO INDIVIDUALS AT

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:25.683
THE DOOR.

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:28.619
AND THEY FILE A CLAIM. FOR

00:36:28.686 --> 00:36:30.755
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THE

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:32.690
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY.

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:34.859
THEN CAN THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:36.060
TO DEFEND HERSELF FROM THAT

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:38.663
CLAIM RIGHT.

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:40.665
USING USING CAMPAIGN FUNDS.

00:36:40.731 --> 00:36:42.600
ASSUMING ASSUMING THAT THERE WAS

00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:44.068
NO DISCRIMINATION BUT JUST THAT

00:36:44.135 --> 00:36:45.836
THE ALLEGATION [inaudible]

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:49.640
WELL I IF THERE'S AN ALLEGATION

CLAIM OF A FEE HA THEN YES THIS

00:36:53.110 --> 00:36:53.778
BILL WOULD.

00:36:53.844 --> 00:36:54.946
WOULD PROHIBIT THAT YOU SEE

CAMPAIGN A LEGAL DEFENSE FUND

00:36:55.846 --> 00:36:57.682
EVEN ASSUMING THAT THERE IS

00:36:57.748 --> 00:36:59.917
ACTUALLY NO FOUND VIOLATION

00:36:59.984 --> 00:37:01.652
CORRECT --

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:03.654
ASSUMING THERE IS NO PHAM

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:04.689
VIOLATION THAT IS THAT IS

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:04.956
CORRECT.

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:06.891
JUST CURIOUS IN TERMS AT P. P.'S

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.659

THE CULPABILITY OF THE

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.731
INDIVIDUAL THAT.

00:37:13.798 --> 00:37:15.866
THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.001
BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE CULPABLE

00:37:17.068 --> 00:37:18.703
IN THOSE ARE NOT CULPABLE IN

00:37:18.769 --> 00:37:19.870

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:22.673
POSITION.

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:24.809
I BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT IS OUR

00:37:24.875 --> 00:37:25.810
POSITION.

00:37:25.876 --> 00:37:26.010
YES.

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.646
OKAY -- IT

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:29.714
[inaudible]

RIGHT NOW --

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:42.760
SO IF A CANDIDATE AGAIN ASSUMING

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.195
THAT THE KENNEDYS DONE NOTHING

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:45.696
WRONG.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.697
ALL RIGHT.

00:37:46.764 --> 00:37:47.732
THE SENATE CAN LAYS THE NOTHING

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:50.701
WRONG IN IS SUED --

00:37:50.768 --> 00:37:52.770
WEALTHY CANDIDATE COULD PAY OUT

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.639

[inaudible] FOR DEFENSE.

00:37:57.742 --> 00:37:59.076
I GUESS THIS IS NO PROHIBITION

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:00.711
ON THAT MEAN THEY'RE WILLING TO

00:38:00.778 --> 00:38:01.812
PUT UP THOSE PERSONAL FUNDS YES

00:38:01.879 --> 00:38:03.881
BUT A CANDIDATE THAT IS NOT

00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:04.749
WEALTHY.

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:07.018
BASICALLY WHAT WHAT IT WHAT IS

00:38:07.084 --> 00:38:10.655
THEIR RECOURSE --

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:11.822
WELL EVERY COURSE WOULD BE --

00:38:11.889 --> 00:38:16.661
THAT THEY COULD --

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:17.928
THEY COULD ASK FOR PRO BONO

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.664
LEGAL SERVICE.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:19.897
OKAY --

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.800
ORTEGA IS FOR FREE LEGAL SERVICE

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:24.702
OKAY WHAT ELSE --

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:27.672
THEY COULD ALSO.

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:29.006
IT'S A I'VE TO APOLOGIZE MISTER

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:32.710
CHAIR AT I'M RACKING MY BRAIN --

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:33.944
THEY GO BANKRUPT IS WHAT THEY DO

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:34.679
RIGHT.

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:37.915
I MEAN THEY THEY DON'T HAVE THE

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.684
ABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.819
SO THEY BASICALLY ALLOW THE

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:45.690
CLAIM TO GO FORWARD IF FOUND.

00:38:45.756 --> 00:38:46.757
OR EVEN IF NOT FOUND LET'S

00:38:46.824 --> 00:38:47.692
ASSUME THE NOT FOUND.

00:38:47.758 --> 00:38:49.694
THE THE THE JUST.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.896
THE COST OF OF WHATEVER THEY CAN

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.698
AFFORD.

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:54.198
BASICALLY FORCES THEM TO

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.700
BANKRUPTCY.

00:38:55.766 --> 00:38:57.635
IF I MAY IT'S KIND OF LIKE LIFE

00:38:57.702 --> 00:38:59.003
IS NOW RIGHT IF YOU'RE RICH YOU

00:38:59.070 --> 00:38:59.970
CAN BUY YOUR WAY OUT OF

00:39:00.037 --> 00:39:01.305
SOMETHING IF NOT YOU SEXUALLY

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.807
HARASSED SOMEONE AND YOU DON'T

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:04.675
HAVE THE MONEY DEFEND YOURSELF.

00:39:04.742 --> 00:39:05.710
THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE A

00:39:05.776 --> 00:39:06.944
DEFENSE I I I THINK THAT WE

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:08.679
SHOULDN'T MAKE THIS ABOUT BEING

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:10.114
RICH OR POOR AND THAT THE ONLY

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.782
REASON YOU CAN DEFEND YOURSELF

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:12.817
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE ELECTED YOU

00:39:12.883 --> 00:39:14.752
HAVE A CAMPAIGN FUND.

00:39:14.819 --> 00:39:16.787
DON'T DO THE BEHAVIOR AND THEN

00:39:16.854 --> 00:39:17.955
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:18.989
I I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:20.091
TRYING TO GO WILL WORRIED ABOUT

00:39:20.157 --> 00:39:21.826
THAT PERSON WHO IS FALSELY

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:23.627
ACCUSED WHICH WE DO A LOT RIGHT

00:39:23.694 --> 00:39:24.795
WE WORRY ABOUT THE FALSELY

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.030
ACCUSED PERSON IN THE SMALL

00:39:26.097 --> 00:39:26.731
PERCENTAGE.

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.833
WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PEOPLE

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:30.835
THAT ARE ACTUALLY BEING HARASSED

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:31.802
OR SEXUALLY HARASSED OR

00:39:31.869 --> 00:39:33.804
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.

00:39:33.871 --> 00:39:34.905
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE WERE TRYING

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:36.807
TO PROTECT WITH THIS BILL WE

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:37.908
DON'T WANT ANYONE FROM NOT

00:39:37.975 --> 00:39:39.110
ANYONE FALSELY ACCUSED TO GET

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.611
CAUGHT UP IN THAT.

00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:42.613
BUT WE CANNOT HELP SOMEONE'S

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.848
VACATE BEHAVIOR I CAN ONLY

00:39:43.914 --> 00:39:45.716
CONTROL CONNIE LABOR'S BEHAVIOR

00:39:45.783 --> 00:39:46.851
SO I'M NOT A RICH WOMAN SO I

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.719
DON'T SEXUALLY HARASSED PEOPLE

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.788
BECAUSE I COULDN'T DEFEND MYSELF

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:53.691
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT.

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.025

I IS A SAID AT THE OUTSET I I

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:57.628
THINK THE CONCEPT IS BOTH

00:39:57.695 --> 00:39:58.662
IMPORTANT.

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:01.799
AND IS WELL FOUNDED THE QUESTION

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.601
IS IS THAT SINCE WE'RE IN THIS

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.135
BILL WE DON'T DISTINGUISH

00:40:04.201 --> 00:40:06.604
BETWEEN THOSE WHO HAVE ARRESTED

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.606
THOSE WHO ARE SIMPLY ACCUSED OF

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:09.673
HARASSMENT.

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.374

BECAUSE THEY WANT TO KNOW IF

00:40:18.883 --> 00:40:19.950
IT'S A GREAT ALLY THEY WANT TO

00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:20.785
KNOW IF THE DISCLOSURE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.686
VIOLATIONS ARE THERE.

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:23.654
THESE ARE NOT SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.689
CLAIMS ARE NOT HUNDREDS OF THOSE

00:40:25.756 --> 00:40:27.792
THAT ARE UNFOUNDED SO I JUST

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:28.659
WANNA BE CLEAR.

00:40:28.726 --> 00:40:30.027
AND I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.695

EVERYTHING FROM HOME SECURITY

00:46:29.052 --> 00:46:31.722
SYSTEMS --

TO TO AS YOU DESCRIBED

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.925

OR AT AND IF IT GETS VERY DETAIL

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.732
AND ALSO GETS VERY BROAD AND SO

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.967
THE ACTION OR THE PROPOSAL THAT

00:46:44.034 --> 00:46:45.002
CENTER LEYVA IN THE ABUSE YOUR

00:46:45.068 --> 00:46:45.802
BRINGING TODAY IS NOT

00:46:45.869 --> 00:46:46.803
UNPRECEDENTED --

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.739
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN.

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:51.808
DECIDE HOW THESE FUNDS THAT ARE

00:46:51.875 --> 00:46:53.710
HELD IN TRUST ARE USED --

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:54.845
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S USED IN A

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.647
WAY THAT IS NOT --

00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:57.848
NOT SOLELY PROTECTED BY THE

00:46:57.915 --> 00:47:01.652
FIRST AMENDMENT AND EXPENDITURE

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.687
OF OF COMMUNICATING WITH VOTERS.

00:47:03.754 --> 00:47:04.721
THE GUY I THINK THERE'S A A A A

00:47:04.788 --> 00:47:05.989
GOOD PATH TO RESOLUTION HERE

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.057
THAT JUST WORKS YOUR TO

00:47:07.124 --> 00:47:08.825
COMPRESSED ON TIME FRANKLY TO TO

00:47:08.892 --> 00:47:11.695
SORT IT OUT BUT I THINK.

00:47:11.762 --> 00:47:13.630
THERE'S THIS LINE BETWEEN.

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:16.667
CULPABILITY AN ACCUSATION THAT

00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:17.668
IS NOT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BINARY

00:47:17.734 --> 00:47:19.203
RIGHT SO THAT I THINK THERE'S A

00:47:19.269 --> 00:47:21.705
WAY. TO LOOK AT WE GO THROUGH

00:47:21.772 --> 00:47:23.840
SUBSTANTIATION PROCESS FOR WITH

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:27.644
OUR AND THE WORKPLACE CONDUCT

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:28.779
COMMITTEE WOULD WE SET UP LAST

00:47:28.845 --> 00:47:29.646
YEAR IS THAT WHAT IT'S CALLED.

00:47:29.713 --> 00:47:30.747
THE COMEDIAN WORKPLACE CONDUCT

00:47:30.814 --> 00:47:31.748
IN REFERS THROUGH THAT PANEL TO

00:47:31.815 --> 00:47:33.650
RULES COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:34.952
BUT THAT SUBSTANTIATION PROCESS.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:37.087
ISN'T NECESSARILY A FINDING OF

00:47:37.154 --> 00:47:39.790
CULPABILITY BUT IT IS SOME KIND

00:47:39.856 --> 00:47:41.658
OF THRESHOLD OF SUBSTANTIATION

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.760
MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOMETHING

00:47:43.827 --> 00:47:44.828
THAT LIES IN THERE WERE YOU'RE

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:45.829
SAYING OKAY IT'S MORE LIKELY

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:46.763
THAN NOT.

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:49.766
THIS INDIVIDUAL COMMITTED THIS

00:47:49.833 --> 00:47:51.735
AT YOU KNOW VIOLATION OF THE HOT

00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:52.836
BUT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU

00:47:52.903 --> 00:47:55.672
KNOW A CRIMINAL OR CIVIL

00:47:55.739 --> 00:47:59.643
CULPABILITY ON THAT FRONT WE'RE

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:00.777
WE'RE SORT OF STRETCHED.

00:48:00.844 --> 00:48:02.846
FOR TIME IN SPACE BUT I WOULD

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:03.847
JUST ASK.

00:48:03.914 --> 00:48:04.881
CONSIDER SOMETHING IN THAT GRAY

00:48:04.948 --> 00:48:07.751
AREA THERE BECAUSE I WANT THE

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:09.820
SENATE PROCESS TO WORK.

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.121
RIGHT AS IT SHOULD AND I'M I'M

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:12.689
THINKING.

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:13.924
BUT I BUT I ALSO TOTALLY AGREE

00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:15.692
WITH YOU THAT WE SHOULDN'T.

00:48:15.759 --> 00:48:18.695
YOU KNOW THOSE WHO ACTUALLY HAVE.

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:19.730
YOU KNOW SUBSTANTIALLY CLAIMS

00:48:19.796 --> 00:48:20.764
AGAINST THEM AND NOT NOT THIS

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.965
REALLY VIOLATIONS RIGHT YOU'RE

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:23.834
NOT TALKING ABOUT --

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.902
THEY'RE ALREADY CONVICTED OR

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:27.804
YOU'RE SORT OF DELAYING JUSTICE

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:29.606
FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO SEE

00:48:29.673 --> 00:48:30.841
BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW

00:48:30.907 --> 00:48:31.475
QUICKLY THESE THINGS WILL PLAY

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:31.708
OUT.

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:33.010
BUT THAT THAT SORT OF IMMEDIATE

00:48:33.076 --> 00:48:34.911
INVESTIGATION PROCESS MAYBE

00:48:34.978 --> 00:48:36.680
THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE THAT.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:37.981
WE CAN WORK THROUGH BUT ANYHOW

00:48:38.048 --> 00:48:41.685
THAT WAS MY QUICK COMMENT.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:43.754
OF ANOTHER ANOTHER QUESTION THAT

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:44.821
SENATOR STERN RACISM POINT TWO

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.623
WITH RESPECT TO CRIMINAL CONDUCT

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:48.825
SO IF IF I ACTUALLY SHOT MY

00:48:48.892 --> 00:48:50.694
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

00:48:50.761 --> 00:48:51.795
IN THE CAMPAIGN OFFICE BECAUSE

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.697
I'M UPSET WITH THE MAIL.

00:48:53.764 --> 00:48:55.999
THEN I COULD USE CAMPAIGN FUNDS

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.734
TO DEFEND MYSELF IS THAT IS THAT

00:48:57.801 --> 00:48:59.636
ACCURATE --

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:00.804
LORD HAVE TO BE.

00:49:00.871 --> 00:49:03.607
DIRECTLY RELATED. TO SOME

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:04.141
POLITICAL AS THEY WERE

00:49:04.207 --> 00:49:05.642
GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSE --

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:08.011
FORTUNATELY WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:10.714
SCENARIO COME UP --

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:11.782
WE'RE NOT GONNA.

00:49:11.848 --> 00:49:13.784
TO CONTEMPLATING I'M NOT

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.785
CONTEMPLATING TESTING THAT I

00:49:14.851 --> 00:49:15.986
WRITE OFFS THIS OR THAT

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:16.953
HYPOTHETICAL RIGHT --

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.722
AND AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT --

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:20.657
THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:22.659
CANDIDATES TO JUSTIFY WHY THAT

00:49:22.726 --> 00:49:23.960
IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF CAMPAIGN

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.729
FUNDS THAT WOULD --

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:27.764
BE ALLOWED UNDER THE PEEL G.

00:49:27.831 --> 00:49:29.633
EXCEPTION --

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.867
AND AND WHAT WHAT FACTORS THE

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.035
SCENARIOS WOULD WOULD QUALIFY

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:34.004
FOR THAT AND AND MISTER CHAIR I

00:49:34.071 --> 00:49:34.971
THINK YOU ARE POINTING OUT

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:38.041
REALLY THE THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:41.712
CAMPAIGN FIND WE CAN WE HAVE

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:42.913
VERY BROAD RULES AND A LOT OF

00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.815
BROAD EXCEPTIONS --

00:49:44.881 --> 00:49:46.016
AND THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:47.851
POTENTIAL HYPOTHETICALS AND WHAT

00:49:47.918 --> 00:49:48.819
IFS THAT --

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.787
THAT WE GET ASKED ON A ON A

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:52.622
YEARLY BASIS THROUGH OUR ADVICE

00:49:52.689 --> 00:49:53.724
PROCESS --

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.825
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE.

00:49:54.891 --> 00:49:55.992
WE HAVE TO MAKE THESE

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.761
DETERMINATIONS AND AND THAT IS

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:59.663
WHERE THIS BILL REALLY

00:49:59.730 --> 00:50:00.764
ORIGINATED AS SOMEBODY HAD ASKED

00:50:00.831 --> 00:50:02.032
WHETHER OR NOT THEY COULD USE

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:03.900
CAMPAIGN FUNDS. FOR THIS --

00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.636
THE FEE HOW RELATED --

00:50:06.703 --> 00:50:07.904
UNLAWFUL PRACTICES --

00:50:07.971 --> 00:50:09.806
AND OUR COMMISSION VOTED --

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:11.241
THAT THAT IT WASN'T A PERMITTED

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.877
USE OF OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS --

00:50:13.944 --> 00:50:15.846
AND BECAUSE F OUR AGENCIES

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:19.683
ACTION THERE IS SOME --

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:20.817
THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME CLARITY

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.085
IN THE LAW THAT NEEDS TO BE

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:23.920
FURTHER DEFINED BY ONE OF THE

00:50:23.987 --> 00:50:24.855
OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND

00:50:24.921 --> 00:50:26.656
THAT BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE OR

00:50:26.723 --> 00:50:27.724
THE COURTS.

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:29.726
AND THE COMMISSION --

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:32.763
ONE IN THAT WE COULD BRING LEAVE

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:33.997
IT TO THE COURTS WHICH CAN BE

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:35.732
UNPREDICTABLE AT TIMES AND SO WE

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:37.734
SPONSORED THIS LEGISLATION AND

00:50:37.801 --> 00:50:38.835
AND WE HOPE THAT WE HAVE YOUR

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.771
VOTE ULTIMATELY LIMIT LET ME RUN

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:43.740
OF SUGGESTION BY BOTH OF YOU --

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.842
SO FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE IS AN

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.711
ALLEGATION.

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.880
OF SOME IMPRPRIETY WITHIN THE

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:51.715
CONTEXT OF A FEE HA.

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:54.651
IN THAT PERSON USES CAMPAIGN

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.686
FUNDS TO DEFEND HERSELF AND THEN

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.921
AT THE END OF IT IF THERE'S A

00:50:57.988 --> 00:51:01.691
FINDING OF THE IT'S NOT FOUNDED.

00:51:01.758 --> 00:51:03.093
THEN THAT PERSON GOES ON THEIR

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.694
MERRY WAY.

00:51:04.761 --> 00:51:06.730
IF THERE IS A FINDING --

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:09.866
AND YET TO BE DEFINED FINDING OF

00:51:09.933 --> 00:51:10.901
SOME SORT OF CULPABILITY.

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:12.769
THEN THE PERSON JUST LIKE OTHER

00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:13.904
VIOLATIONS IS REQUIRED TO

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:15.839
REIMBURSE THE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:17.908
AND ALSO RUNS THE RISK OF BEING.

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.709
IN VIOLATION.

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:20.844
WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

THIS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THAT

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.649
AS ELECTED OFFICIALS PEOPLE GIVE

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:24.768
COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT

WHAT IF SOMEONE GETS FALSELY

00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:41.618
ACCUSED WELL OF COURSE WE DON'T

00:53:41.685 --> 00:53:43.620
WANT ANYONE FALSELY ACCUSED BUT

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:45.655

00:53:45.722 --> 00:53:46.890
RAPISTS ARE ACTUALLY CHARGED WE

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:48.124

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:54.798
DETER PEOPLE RIGHT IF I'M

ELECTED MAYBE I'M GONNA THINK

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.868
TWICE ABOUT SEXUALLY HARASSING.

00:53:58.935 --> 00:54:01.671

TO BE PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.646
SO SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO

00:54:09.713 --> 00:54:11.848
LEGISLATE FOR THE BAD ACTORS AND

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.083
