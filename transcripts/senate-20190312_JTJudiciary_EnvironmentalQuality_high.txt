HERE THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY AND THE COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY TO HOLD AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON SEQUEL ENTITLED JUST THE FACTS. AND EVIDENCE BASED LOOK AT SICK WAS STREAMLINING AND SEQUELS ROLE IN DEVELOPMENT. IT IS OUR HOPE AND EXPECTATION THAT -- WE WILL PROVIDE GREATER PRECISION AND CLARITY ON WHAT SHE QUIT IS AND WHAT IT ISN'T. I'M TOLD THAT WERE COMPETING WITH THE DMV HEARING -- SO -- YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS MORE FASCINATING. BUT CLEARLY -- ALL THOSE ISSUES ALL THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT AND CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF US -- DEALING WAS SYKORA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE IS TASKED WITH SEQUEL FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL PERSPECTIVE. AND THE COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY IS TASKS WAS TO GO FROM THE LIABILITY AND LEGAL -- PROCEDURAL ISSUE SO WE'RE HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AND I WANT TO WELCOME EVERYONE EXTEND MY GRATITUDE TO MY COLLEAGUES HERE. MY BOY CHECK HERE AND ONE IN THIS EVENT PARTNERING WITH US TO PUT THIS. VERY SO I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING ON A FAIRLY COMPLEX ISSUE -- LOTS OF INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION -- HAS GONE ON FOR YEARS ABOUT SEE WHAT IT'S BEEN THE TOPIC OF SO MANY CONVERSATIONS HERE IN THE CAPITAL WE'VE ALL HEARD STORIES ABOUT SEEK WERE. THAT IT'S BEEN USED BY SOME GROUPS MAY BE NIMBIS OR BUSINESS COMPETITORS. TO DERAIL SOME MERITORIOUS OF PROJECTS. WE DO KNOW THERE ARE ABUSES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD ABOUT THEM -- BUT THE THE OLD SAYING THAT MY STAFF INSISTS THAT I SAY THAT I DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. THE POOR THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTES DOES NOT EVIDENCE MAKE. APPARENTLY LIKE SAID SAYING. BY DIAL WHAT I LIKE ABOUT IT IS THE FACT THAT THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXCEPTION TO EVERY RULE THERE'S ALWAYS A HORROR STORY. TO EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT WE GET TO THE TO THE OR TO THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT IS REAL WHAT IS SIGNIFICANT. AND WHAT IS NOT SO. WHAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT A AS MUCH OF THE OVERALL TRENDS OR EMPIRICAL STUDIES BY NEUTRAL PARTIES VERY IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL STUDIES BY NEUTRAL PARTIES? WHO HAVE NO FINANCIAL INTEREST OR BIAS AND ON THE ISSUE A SEQUEL FRANKLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL RETURN ON INVESTMENT? THERE'S A LOT OF MONEY AT STAKE A LOT OF ECONOMIC WELL BEING. SO ARE WE REALLY HAVE RECENT CHANGES AND SEE HOW THEY'VE BEEN WORKING. EVERY SESSION THERE'S A RUSH. TO REFORM SEEK WORK AND A LOT OF US FRANKLY DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THIS COMPLEX AND EVOLVING PROCEDURAL STATUTE ARE DOING TODAY DIFFERENTLY THAN WHAT THEY DID A FEW YEARS AGO -- ADAM PARDON -- WHICH SOME OF THE INFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION IS SPACE SO -- THE GOAL IS TO FIND OUT. OF WHETHER SHE COULD TRULY IS A SOURCE OF PROBLEMS AS SOME ALLEGE -- IT PARTICULARLY IN OUR AREA OF HIGH HOUSING WHERE WE ARE AS WE KNOW ABOUT THREE MILLION UNITS SHORT. HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THIS IS WHY SENATOR ALLEN AND I DECIDED TO PUT ON THIS HEARING TOGETHER TO GET SOME OF THE BASIC FACTS ABOUT SEE WHAT. WHAT IT IS AGAIN THE STREAMLINED CHANGES SOME OF WHICH HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS? AND WHAT ROLE IT PLAYS FAX THE IDEA IS TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE QUIT IS. HOW IT HAS BEEN STREAMLINED AND WHETHER THAT'S WORKING SO WHAT WE ARE NOT FOCUSED HERE ON TODAY AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT IS WE'RE NOT FOCUSED ON HOW TO FIX SEEK WHAT? WE JUST WANT TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT IS WHAT IT'S DOING -- WILL HAVE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO DEAL WITH THOSE OTHER ISSUES THEN PERHAPS ANOTHER HEARING. AT SOME OTHER POINT IN TIME BUT WE WANTED TO MAINTAIN CLARITY -- AND SO THAT IS THE REASON FOR THIS HEARING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TWO PANELS OF NEUTRAL EXPERTS WILL THEN OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC. DISCUSSION TO HEAR FROM THE VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES OUT THERE. AND WE WILL ASK YOU IS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. A STEP FORWARD TO THE MIGHT GIVE YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION AND TWO MINUTES -- SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW EVERYBODY TO SPEAK WE CERTAINLY WILL -- WELCOME WRITTEN COMMENTS AND IT IS MY EXPECTATION THAT THIS IS FRANKLY JUST THE BEGINNING OF A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION THIS YEAR SO -- WITH THAT -- I WOULD LIKE. TO HAND THE GAVEL OF OVER TO MY ESTEEMED CO CHAIR SENATOR BEEN ALLEN. WHO IS THE CHAIR THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE FOR SOME OPENING REMARKS? THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I I DO I DO WANT. TO EXTEND MY MY GREAT THANKS TO YOU FOR AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER. YOUR LEADERSHIP IN PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER INTERESTING AND AND I'M ALSO VERY FIRST OF MY STAFFER BRIEFING ME GETTING YOU PREPARED. FOR THIS -- HEARING IT'S A IT'S A DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX ISSUE AS WE KNOW -- IS A PROCEDURAL STATUTE THERE WAS ESTABLISHED FIFTY YEARS AGO AND AND IS REALLY BEEN -- BACKBONE. PIECE OF OF LEGISLATION AND LAW -- FOR STATES -- BE LEGISLATION RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT. OF COURSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT SEA QUEST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SOME OF CALLS FOR REFORM SOME SAY THAT. AYE AYES HAD NEGATIVE COST AND TIMING IMPACTS ON HOUSING PRODUCTION IN PARTICULAR THAT'S BEEN AT THE HEART. OF THE MOST RECENT CONTROVERSY HERE ABOUT SEQUINED THERE OTHERS OF COURSE YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE AND SO IMPORTANT. TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO CRITICALLY ANALYZE AND MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT AND AND THAT THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. USE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO JUST GROW OUR OUR BASE OF KNOWLEDGE AS EQUAL LEGISLATION COMES BEFORE BOTH OF OUR COMMITTEES. I OUR FIRST PANEL WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING ABOUT SOME OF THE STREAMLINING PROVISIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER SEEK WHAT. SPECIFICALLY ONES THAT ARE RELATED TO INFILL HOUSING. AND ALSO JUDICIAL STREAMLINING PROVISIONS. I MEN WILL HAVE A SECOND PANEL THAT WILL COVER TWO INTERESTING STUDIES THAT. HAVE COME OUT RECENTLY THAT THE PANELISTS -- CONDUCTED ON THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS SEES IN -- BOTH THE BAY AREA AND THEN DIED DOWN IN LOS ANGELES. SO THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN THE NEWS AS AN ISSUE AS AS MEMBER STRUCTURE CONTINUES TO TO GROW IN THE STATE AND BUT IT BUT IT ALSO QUESTION RELATED TO THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENING ABOUT AFFORDABLE. HOUSING AND WE'RE VERY INTRIGUED ABOUT HOW -- OUR PANELISTS COME FORWARD WITH WHAT'S TODAY SO I'M I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DISCUSSION AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER. VERY GOOD AND BEFORE WE START ANY COMMENTS OR THOUGHTS FROM THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NO ALL RIGHT WITH THAT -- AS SO SENATOR ALLEN INDICATED THE FOCUS OF OUR FIRST PANEL IS ON SEQUELS STREAMLINING PROVISIONS. BROADLY THIS RIVER REFERS TO THINGS SUCH AS SPEEDING UPS THE SEQUEL PROCESS. INCLUDING PROVISIONS OF MAKE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW MORE EFFICIENT. EXEMPTIONS AN EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW WITH US TODAY ARE TERRY RIVERS PLAZA. OUR FIRST PANELIST FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS MYSTERY THIS PLOT A IS A SENIOR ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNER WITH ICF INTERNATIONAL HE ALSO TEACHES CLASSES. ON C. CORE AND RELATED TOPICS FOR CLIENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA EXTENSION. IT WAS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE TO NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT SO. HE CERTAINLY HAS A SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE ON THIS AND INCLUDING AND THERE WAS A STINT AS THE CHIEF OF BOTH THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE AND THE PLANNING UNIT. DISSIPATED IN THE DRAFTING OF THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT NINETY SEVEN AND NINETY FOUR AMENDMENTS TO THE SEQUEL GUIDELINES. AND HE IS EDITOR OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSOR FOR THE ASSOCIATION. OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS WAS CO AUTHOR OF THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT NINETEEN NINETY THE SEVEN ADDITIONS. OF A GENERAL PLAN GUIDELINES SO. HE WILL BE FIRST UP TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW SEQUENCE DESCRIPTION OF ITS MOST COMMON EXEMPTIONS. AND KEY STREAMLINING PROVISIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST DECADES. AS WELL AS A DESCRIPTION OF THE SURVEY A E. P. RECENTLY CONDUCTED ABOUT HOW CITIES ARE USING THESE PROVISIONS MISTER RIVERS PLOT OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISSUS MIST CHAIR -- SO I'M GONNA GO THROUGH SEQUENCE OF TITLE THE SEQUENCE TEN MINUTES. TRYING TO GO THROUGH IT AS QUICKLY AS I CAN. CALIFORNIA VERY MORE QUALITY EXES AN ACT IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOLLOWED ON THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT ACTUALLY SIGNED BY RICHARD NIXON IN. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE THE ARE TWO DISTINCT LAWS SO WE HAVE CALIFORNIAN BERMAN QUALITY ACT APPLYING TO CALIFORNIA ACTIVITIES -- BOTH OF THEM HOWEVER CAME OF THE ECOLOGY MOVEMENT IN LATE NINETEEN SIXTIES WHERE WE FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW THE BIG BLUE MARBLE CALIFORNIA AT EARTH FROM SPACE. PEOPLE REALIZE THAT WE NEEDED TO PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT -- SECRET PREDATES MOST OF CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT CLEAN WATER ACT IN THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- AND THIS RESULTED HAS A BROADER SCOPE IT IS A PROCESS GO THROUGH TO POTENTIAL AND BEING A PERMIT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. A PROJECT TO CREATE THAT CAN BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL REGULATIONS MAY STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT THE PROJECT RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL ADVERSE CHANGE FROM EXISTING. CONDITIONS. SOME BASIC PROVISIONS OF SYKORA -- NUMBER ONE DISCLOSED THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS FOR PROJECT TO THE PUBLIC AND DECISION MAKERS. THE NUMBER TO MITIGATE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IMPACTS WHEN FEASIBLE. OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE PUBLIC AND OTHER AGENCIES TO BECOME INVOLVED IN VINYL REVIEW -- REQUIRED DECISION MAKERS TO BALANCE BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT AND THE ENVIRONMENT -- BEFORE TAKING ACTIONS ON PROJECTS. TO AVOID CREATING AN OVERSIGHT AGENCY LEGISLATURE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY CHOSE TO IN FOR SECRET TO LITIGATION. AND WE SEE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE OR SO REPORTED SECRET DECISIONS EACH YEAR. THING TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROJECTS ARE NOT LITIGATED. A SEQUEL APPLIES TO WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PROJECTS EACH YEAR BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE NORTH OF I WOULD SAY PROBABLY -- TWENTY THOUSAND PROJECTS. WHICH I'LL TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT LATER. THIS APPLICATION A CHARACTER SEQUEL PLACE TO DISCRETIONARY ACTIONS BY PUBLIC AGENCIES. WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ADVISE THE RESULT IN ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT IT DOESN'T APPLY TO WHAT ARE CALLED MINISTERIAL ACTIONS WITH THE AGENCIES SIMPLY APPLY STANDARD REQUIREMENTS. AND HAVE NO DISCRETION TO DENY A PROJECT -- WAR TO PLEASE MITIGATION ON IT. THERE IS A SAID LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS EVERY YEAR SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT -- IT'S APPLICABLE WOODY TO LOCAL PROJECTS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON THE PARTICULAR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- REGULATIONS ARE TYPICALLY THERE'S A SPECIFIC PLANS OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS -- THOSE PROJECTS TO THE DISCRETION UNDER LOCAL CODER SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT THOSE AT A MINISTERIAL NOT -- AS POINTED OUT BY THIS STUDIES DID YOU HEAR ABOUT A LEADER -- THERE IT VARIES GREATLY BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS AS TO WHAT SORTS OF THINGS ARE DISCRETIONARY AND WHICH ARE NOT. THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY SICK WAS A PROCESS FOR DISCLOSING POTENTIAL IMPACTS FOR PROJECT BEFORE THE AGENCY TAKES ACTION TO APPROVE THAT PROJECT AS I MENTIONED IT'S NOT A PERMIT DOESN'T SUPPLANT. EXISTING REGULATIONS IT'S ESSENTIALLY. AN INFORMATION GATHERING -- PROVISION DOESN'T GRANT AGENCIES ANY ADDITIONAL POWERS THAN WHAT THEY ALREADY HAVE SOME MINUTES -- ANY SORT OF MITIGATION UNDER SEQUEL FALLS UNDER THE POWERS AGENCY ALREADY HAS IT DESN'T ALLOW HIM TO DO ANYTHING THEY COULDN'T ALREADY DO. SO SINCE COMMON SECRET TERMS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS ESSENTIALLY A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT RESULTING EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM A PARTICULAR PROJECT -- MITIGATION IS A MEASURE THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROJECT TO REDUCE MINIMIZER OTHERWISE AVOID IT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS -- MITIGATION IS ONLY REQUIRED TO MITIGATE LOW A LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE THERE'S THIS SORT OF CAM HERE I GUESS OF A THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANCE SO YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO TOTALLY ELIMINATE THE IMPACTS OF A PROJECT. BUT INSTEAD TO BRING ITS IMPACTS TO A LESS THE TWO TYPES OF EXEMPTION A STATUTORY EXEMPTION CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION -- THOSE TWO TYPES OF EXEMPTIONS GIVE YOU -- AND IS AN AGENCY THAT BILLY TO AVOID HAVING TO DO SEQUEL FOR CERTAIN PROJECTS. HI INITIAL STUDY AN INITIAL STUDY IS A STUDY THAT'S DONE FOR PROJECT THE DON'T QUALIFY FOR AN EXEMPTION. AND FOR WHICH A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION NEGATIVE DECORATION ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WILL BE PREPARED AND THE INITIAL STUDY ESSENTIALLY TAKES THE PUBLIC AGENCY STEP BY STEP. THROUGH ALL THE VARIOUS RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE AFFECTED BY THE PROJECT -- AND GUIDES THEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THIS PROJECT MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT -- INITIAL STUDIES ARE USUALLY -- SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF OTHER STUDIES -- US THINGS LIKE ARCHEOLOGICAL SURVEYS -- TRAFFIC ANALYSIS ALL THAT. NEGATIVE DECORATION MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS THESE OUR FINDINGS THAT ARE ADOPTED BY AN AGENCY ESSENTIALLY FINDING THAT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT BASED ON AN INITIAL STUDY IN OTHER DOCUMENTATION. HAS NO PROB POTENTIAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECT TO OCCUR. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT IS A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT ON THE PROJECT IT EXAMINES AND DISCLOSES ITS SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ANALYZES ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT IT COULD REDUCE THOSE IMPACTS. AND THAT IDENTIFIES MITIGATION MEASURES THAT WOULD REDUCE THE IMPACTS -- NEGATIVE DECORATIONS AND HE AYE OURS ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE THE SAME GENERAL PURPOSE TO DISCLOSE -- CANBE QUITE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF COST AND TIME INVOLVED. MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATIONS ON A COMMON FOR THEM TO BE COMPLETED IN SAY SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF PROJECT. I USUALLY TAKES AT LEAST A YEAR -- AND ON SOME PROJECTS MAYBE TO YEARS AGAIN DEPENDING ON THE COMPLEXITY THE PROJECT. THE NUMBER LOOK INTO THE THREE WAYS THAT SEEK TO APPLY AS IT APPLIES EITHER THROUGH EXEMPTIONS TO MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATIONS OR NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS AND THEN THE THIRD WAY WOULD BE -- ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS OF STATUTORY EXEMPTION A ONE OF THE TWO TYPES OF EXEMPTION THEIR CREATED BY LAW. THE EXEMPT QUALIFYING PROJECTS SOME SECRET REQUIREMENTS TO THE EXTENT SET OUT IN THE PARTICULAR STATUTE THEY CAN BE VERY BROAD. OTHERS AN EXEMPTION FOR REAL ROAD GRADE -- CROSSINGS IF YOU WANT TO INSTALL A GRADE SEPARATION YOU CAN DO THAT WITHOUT ANY SORT OF SEQUEL ANALYSIS AT ALL -- YOU COULD PUT IN TWENTY OF THEM IN YOUR COMMUNITY IF YOU WANTED AND TO BE NO SEQUIN ELSE'S. OR THEY CAN BE NARAL -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INFILL EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE CREATED A NUMBER OF YEARS BACK ARE VERY -- AND A LOT OF QUALIFIERS TO THEM AND BECAUSE OF THAT ARE PARTICULARLY USED VERY OFTEN THE MORE COMPLEX THE STATUTORY EXEMPTION IS KIND OF A GENERAL RULE OF THE LESS OFTEN THEY TEND TO BE USED. CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE CREATED BY REGULATION AS PART OF THE STATE'S SEQUEL GUIDELINES THEIR ADOPTED BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY THEIR LIMITED TO CLASSES OF PROJECTS THAT USUALLY DO NOT HAVE AN IMPACT -- POTENTIAL SO NO POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS -- REPAIRS TO EXISTING STRUCTURES -- CONSTRUCTION OF SMALL STRUCTURES -- INFILL DEVELOPMENT ON A LIMITED BASIS TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CATEGORICALLY EXEMPTION -- IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN CHECKING THE RIG RECORDS FOR THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE. THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SIXTY STATUTORY OR CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS THAT WERE THAT THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE WAS NOTIFIED ABOUT. THOSE WOULD PRIMARILY BE EXEMPTIONS BY STATE AGENCIES. SO WE EXTRAPOLATE THAT STATE WIDE TO THE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS LOCAL AGENCIES ARE YOU GET SOME IDEA OF HOW MANY OF THESE EXEMPTIONS ARE GRANTED EACH YEAR IT'S GOT TO BE IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS. THERE'S NO TALLY FOR A REGIONAL LOCAL AGENCIES SO. 700-700-0100 SIXTY IS PRIMARILY JUST STATE AGENCIES USING EXEMPTIONS. A NATIVE DECORATIONS AND MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATIONS THESE ARE DOCUMENTS THAT ESSENTIALLY ARE SAYING THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT BASED ON OUR INITIAL STUDY AND OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WE'VE STUDIED -- WILL NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATION VARIES FROM A NEGATIVE DECLARATION IN THAT IT HAS SPECIFIC MEASURES INTENDED TO BRING THE IMPACTS BELOW A LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE. BOTH OF THEM HAVE TO BE CIRCULATED FOR PUBLIC REVIEW AND COMMENT BEFORE THE AGENCY CAN ACT ON THE PROJECT. THE AGENCY HAS TO CONSIDER ALL THE COMMENTS DURING ITS DELIBERATIONS THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE CIRCULATED SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED SIXTY SIX NEGATIVE DACHSHUND MITIGATED NECK DECKS IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE ARE A NUMBER THAT APPLY ONLY TO LOCAL PROJECTS WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY -- SO WE WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT IF THERE'S ALMOST. SIXTEEN HUNDRED BEING SENT TO THE STATE CLEARING HOUSE SIMPLY BY STATE AGENCIES AND AGENCIES ARE INVOLVING STATE AGENCIES IN THEIR PROJECTS. THEY'RE PROBABLY A SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL NUMBER OUT THERE. INFORMAL IMPACT REPORT AND THE I. R. IS PREPARED IN TIME THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF PROJECT MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT -- THE AGENCY IT TYPICALLY RELEASES PREPARATION TO PUT POPLE ON NOTICE THAT AND THE I. R. IS BEING PREPARED THAT'S OF AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. THE AGENCY WILL THEN PUT TOGETHER A DRAFTEE I ARE THE DRAFTY OUR COVERAGE POTENTIAL IMPACTS -- AND ALL THE IMPACT CATEGORIES TALKS ABOUT ALTERNATIVES MITIGATION MEASURES. BEFORE TAKING ACTION ONTHE PROJECT THE AGENCY WILL PREPARE WHAT'S CALLED A FINALLY HE I ARE IN WHICH IT RESPONDS IN WRITING TO ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WERE RECEIVED ON THE DRAFT THE I. R. DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD. AN AGENCY CAN APPROVE A PROJECT TO SIGNIFICANT AN UNAVOIDABLE IMPACTS. IF IT ADOPTING THE I. R. AND IF IT ADOPTS FINDINGS EXPLAINING WHY IT'S GOING ABOUT ADOPTING OR APPROVING THIS PROJECT WITH. BAD -- BAD THINGS GOING ON OTHER A NUMBER OF STREAMLINING PROVISIONS NOW IN SEQUENCE. THERE'S A COMMON MISCONCEPTION I GUESS THAT -- STREAMLINING IS ONLY SOMETHING RELATIVELY NEW THERE'S BEEN STREAMLINING IN SECRET FOR FOR DECADES. WELL ONE WAY OF BIG OF STREAMLINING IS THROUGH EXEMPTIONS YOU CAN BYPASS THE NEED FOR NEGATIVE DECLARATION OF ME TO GET ME TO GET NAY DECKER E. I. R. -- THERE'S NO REVIEW PERIOD -- THE AGENCY SIMPLY HAS TO ENSURE THAT -- THERE ARE NO POTENTIAL FOR IMPACTS IF IT'S A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION -- AND THAT THE PARTICULAR PROJECT FITS WITHIN THE THE SCORE FOR SQUARE CORNERS OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THAT EXEMPTION. OF CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT ARE VERY COMMONLY USED THROUGHOUT THE STATE LESS COMMONLY USED OR STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS. FOR INFILL BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE CHECKS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SEAQUEST SO. IF YOU ARE AN AGENCY THAT HAS DETERMINED THAT PARTICULAR ACTIVITIES ARE MINISTERIAL RATHER THAN DISCRETIONARY -- THAN SEQUIN NEVER -- NEVER COMES UP. I CREATING MINISTERIAL PERMITS THAT HAVE STRICT STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF OR FOLLOWED BY EACH PROJECT THAT COMES ALONG IS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR SECRECY OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS SOME AGENCIES HAVE DONE THAT -- OTHER AGENCIES NOT SO MUCH. ABOUT ONE PROJECT ONE DOCUMENT IS A PRINCIPLE OF SEQUEL -- AND NEGATIVE DECORATION MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECORATION ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT PREPARED FOR PROJECT CARRIES FORTH THROUGHOUT THE PERMITTING PROCESS SO THE ORIGINAL AGENCY THAT WROTE THE DOCUMENT. PERMITS THE PROJECT -- OTHER AGENCIES COMING DOWN THE LINE FISH AND WILDLIFE -- CALTRANS WHOEVER THEY MIGHT BE USE THAT SAME DOCUMENT SO THAT HELP STREAMLINE THE PROCESS. UP PROGRAM YOURS IN TEARING OF THIS IS USUALLY A TYPE OF THE I. ARE PREPARED FOR PLAN A REGULATION OR MULTI PHASE PROJECT AND IT'S DESIGNED TO BE USED. IN THE FUTURE -- TO APPLIED IT LATER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE WITHIN THAT SAME SORT OF PROGRAM THAT THEY PREVIOUSLY BEEN APPROVED -- AS THOSE LATER ACTIVITIES OCCUR -- SOME CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE NEW IMPACTS IF THEY'RE NEW IMPACTS A SUBSEQUENT. IN VINYL IMPACT REPORT IS REQUIRED IF NOT YOU GET TO USE THE PROGRAM HE I ARE -- THE ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING I WAS NEVER REOPENED IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THIS LATER ACTIVITY WILL HAVE A NEW IMPACT THAT HADN'T BEEN COVERED. UP PROJECT E. I. OURS CAN ALSO BE TIERED IN A SIMILAR FASHION. LEADER ACTIVITIES THAT ARE PART OF THAT SAME PROJECT. ARE EXAMINED TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD RESULT IN A NEW IMPACT OR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE IMPACT IF NOT YOU USE THE SAME E. I. R. WAS A VIRGIN ORIGINALLY DONE FOR THE PROJECT. IF THEY WOULD THEN YOU WOULD POTENTIALLY PREPARE A SUBSEQUENT E. I. R. OR SUBSEQUENT SECRET DOCUMENT. A SPECIFIC PLANS ARE ANOTHER METHOD OF USING TEARING IN THE EGGS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER -- IF A SPECIFIC PLAN HAS BEEN ADOPTED AN E. I. ARE CERTIFIED FOR THAT SPECIFIC PLAN IN A RESIDENTIAL PROJECT PROPOSED THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN FOLLOWS THE SAME PATTERN. UNLESS THERE'S A NEW IMPACT OR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE IMPACT NOT COVERED IN THE ORIGINAL SPECIFIC PLAN E. I. ARE -- THAT AGENCY CAN TO CONTINUE TO USE THE SPECIFIC PLAN THE I. R. FOR THE LATER PROJECT IF THERE IS ANY IMPACT ON THE PREPARE A SUBSEQUENT DOCUMENT. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS LEGISLATURE'S CREATE A NUMBER OF SECRET STREAMLINING TEARING MECHANISMS INCLUDING NEW EXEMPTIONS WITH ENTRANCE A PRIORITY AREAS. JUSTIN BUT COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER APPROACHES APPLICABLE TO DEVELOPING A TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS -- HOWEVER THESE TEND TO BE MORE COMPLEX THAN THE STANDARD EXEMPTIONS TO PROGRAM THE I. R. THE PROJECT THE I. ARE -- ALSO THEY'VE NOT REALLY BEEN TESTED AND AND SO THEY REALLY HAVEN'T COME INTO WIDESPREAD USE. I OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH HAS WRITTEN A TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMPARING THESE VARIOUS APPROACHES WHICH I'VE ATTACHED TO MY MATERIALS I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO THEM IN ANY DETAIL BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THEM IS UNIQUE. AND EACH ONE OF THEM IS RELATIVELY COMPLEX UNTO ITSELF IT WOULD TAKE US. TEN HOURS RATHER THAN TEN MINUTES TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM. YOU'RE SAYING TESTED INCREASING. WHAT EXACTLY CLOUT CLERK IN QUALIFIES AS TRANSIT ORIENTED SOMETHING LIKE THAT GETTING THOSE DEFINITIONS ARE RIGHT THE DEFINITION IS SIMPLE THE TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS ARE RELATIVELY SIMPLE TO IDENTIFY THEY'VE BEEN IDENTIFIED ON THE -- SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY THE METROPOLITAN PLANNING ORGANIZATIONS OTHER ALSO ESSENTIALLY JUST -- EVERYTHING WITHIN A HALF MILE RADIUS OF THE HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT STOP OUR HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT LINES SO THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY A PROBLEM WHAT THE PROBLEM WITH THE PROBLEM ARISES IS THAT -- THERE ARE NUMBER OF QUALIFIERS APPLY WITHIN EACH ONE OF THOSE AREAS ARE ALSO A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROCEDURES THAT APPLY. SO ONE PROJECT THAT MIGHT WORK VERY NICELY TO BE TIERED ON A SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE FOR EXAMPLE MAY NOT QUALIFY. FOR ONE OF THE STREAMLINING METHODS -- WITHIN TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS AND FOR WHATEVER REASON LEGISLATURE'S CHOSEN TO CREATE PERHAPS FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT WAYS OF TEARING RELATIVELY NEW WAYS OF TEARING AND ALL OF THEM ARE DIFFERENT. AND SO. IT'S A QUESTION OF IF YOU'RE A DEVELOPER IT'S PROBABLY MORE A QUESTION OF HOW DO I DESIGN MY PROJECT. THE FALL WITHIN ONE OF THESE TEARING METHODS THEN IT IS -- OF HERE'S MY PROJECT I'M GOING TO APPLY ONE OF THE TEARING METHODS TO IT. SO IT IT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO DESIGN THINGS TO FOR UGH JUST TO ADD TO THAT AND THEN WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS LET YOU FINISH AND WE'LL HEAR FROM JUST DISROBING THEN HAVE QUESTIONS. BUT CHOSE TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT. THIS ACT AND DOES IT MAKE IT EASIER BECAUSE THE PARAMETERS ARE SET OUT. FOR DEVELOPERS THIS IS WHAT THE IF THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM DIRECTIONS SO THAT IT CREATES GREATER CLARITY AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO TO GET THEIR PROJECT APPROVED. GOOD QUESTION. YES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT GIVES THEM SOME CLARITY AS TO WHAT THEY NEED -- PARTICULARLY THE WHAT'S CALLED THE SENATE BILL -- TWO TWENTY SIX THAT HAS PROVISIONS FOR STATE WIDE -- DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND THEN ALSO LOCAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS PLAY A PART IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT YOUR PROJECT CAN CAN TEAR TEAR OFF OF A PRIOR E. I. ARE -- AND SO THAT DOES GIVE YOU A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CONSISTENCY A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CLARITY AS TO WHAT SORTS OF THINGS WE REQUIRED -- BUT AGAIN IT DEPENDS ON THE PARTICULAR LOCATION DEPENDS ON THE JURISDICTION AND HOW THEY APPLY [inaudible] THANK YOU. DID YOU HAVE ANY YES I WAS GOING TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT HOUSING IN SEQUENCE PLEASE DO. THE ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT PROFESSIONALS WHO I'M REPRESENTING HERE TODAY E. P. A PUBLISHED LAST YEAR WHAT IS CALLED SEEK WAS IMPACT ON HOUSING PRODUCTION WE SURVEYED CALIFORNIA CITIES AN COUNTIES. WE SENT -- LETTERS TO ALL OF THEM AND RECEIVED ABOUT FORTY SIX RESPONSES ABOUT 9% OR SO OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES RESPONDED A SOME OF THEM OVERLAP WITH THE JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE TALKED ABOUT OR WILL BE TALKED ABOUT. A IN THE STUDIES COMING UP AFTER THIS PANEL. THEY COMPRISE ABOUT US SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THE STATE'S LARGEST CITIES ARE RESPONDING. AND ABOUT 30% OF CALIFORNIA'S SINCE WE HAVE LOS ANGELES AN JOSE LONG BEACH SACRAMENTO SAN FRANCISCO. WE COMPILED THIS COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS OF FIVE UNITS OR MORE -- AND WHAT SORT OF THING HAPPENED UNDER SEEK REVIEW WITHIN THESE JURISDICTIONS BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN OTHER ABOUT A FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS THAT WE LOOKED AT OR THAT POPPED UP IN THE SURVEY -- AND ABOUT I SHOULD SY HOUSING PROJECTS FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOUSING PROJECTS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS. OUT OF THESE ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND OR ABOUT 10% OF ALL OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS OF THOSE WOULD FALL UNDER THE WE ARE THE RENO NUMBERS REGIONAL HOUSING -- NEEDS ASSESSMENT NUMBERS OF BEING -- FOR MODERATE -- LOW INCOME VERY LOW INCOME HOUSING TO OUR GENERAL FINDINGS WERE THAT -- STREAMLINING AN EXEMPTION FOR THE PART PREDOMINANT TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR THESE PROJECTS ABOUT 42%OF THEM EITHER USED A MITIGATED NECK DECK -- OR SOME SORT OF CATEGORICAL INFILL EXEMPTION. THE AVERAGE SIZE OF THE PROJECTS REQUIRING III OURS WAS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX UNITS SO IT WAS FOR A RELATIVELY LARGE PROJECTS -- COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE PROJECTS AT ABOUT NINETY IT NAY DECKS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOR THOSE THAT ARE TEARING OFF OF A PREVIOUSLY PREPARED SPECIFIC PLAN -- AND THEN ODDLY ENOUGH THIRTY SEVEN UNITS FOR THE INFILL EXEMPTION ONE THING ABOUT THE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION FOR INFILL IS THAT. LIMITS THE SIZE OF THE PROPERTY THAT CAN BE AFFECTED BUT IT DOESN'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF UNITS INVOLVED SO YOU CAN END UP WITH A LARGER DEVELOPMENTS. AFFORDABLE UNITS BENEFITTED FROM THE STREAMLINING EXEMPTIONS TO A GREATER EXTENT TO MARKET EIGHT UNITS IN MOST RIVER REVIEWED BY TEARING FROM SPECIFIC PLAN HE AYE OURS ARE USING THE CATEGORICAL INFILL EXEMPTION -- ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN OUT OF THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE SAMPLE REVIEWED USING THAT STATUTORY AFFORDABLE HOUSING EXEMPTION. SO IT INDICATES AGAIN THAT IT'S NOT VERY WIDELY USED -- SEEK REVIEW UTILIZING FULLY AYE OURS WAS PROPORTIONING MORE COMMON AN ABOVE AVERAGE HOUSING PRODUCTION COMMUNITIES AS PART OF OUR STUDY WHAT WE DID WAS A DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT -- AGENCIES WERE -- PRODUCING HOUSING LAID OUT IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENTS AND OF THE ONES THAT WERE DOING BETTER -- UTILIZED FULL E. I. OURS -- ACTUALLY MORE COMMONLY THAN OTHER AGENCIES -- FINDINGS ON SICK WAS A CONSTRAINT WE FOUND THAT THE PERCEIVED CAUSAL RENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEEK REVIEW AND FREQUENT PROJECT WITH WITHDRAWALS MAYBE SEQUEL. SIGNIFICANTLY OVERSTATED -- SOME PEOPLE OF SIDE WITHDRAWAL OF PROJECT DURING SEEK REVIEWS A SIGNALED SECRET DISCOURAGES PROJECT APPLICANTS TO THE POINT OF SEIZING THE PROCESS OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT -- BUT WHEN WE ASKED OUR SURVEY RESPONDENTS ABOUT THIS -- IN TOTAL THERE WERE FIFTY ONE PROJECT WITHDRAWALS COVERING ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED UNITS -- EQUIVALENT TO A WITHDRAWAL RATE OF ABOUT TWO POINT 8% OF THE TOTAL UNITS IN THE SURVEY. WE ALSO DON'T KNOW NECESSARILY WHETHER IT'S SEEK TOP THREE FACTORS THAT WE FOUND IN OUR SURVEY AFFECTING MARKET RATE HOUSING PRODUCTION CITED BY RESPONDENTS WERE HIGH DEVELOPMENT COSTS SUCH AS IMPACT FEES COST OF LAND. ON NON SEQUEL RELATED NEIGHBORHOOD OPPOSITION -- AND THEN SIMPLE LACK OF AVAILABLE SITES A SEQUEL REVIEW WAS SELECTED FOUR TIMES AS BEING A CONSTRAINT OUT OF THE HUNDRED AND TWELVE RESPONSES THAT WE RECEIVED. A RECALL OF COURSE OF THESE RESPONSES FROM LOCAL AGENCY CITIES AND COUNTIES. THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED FACTORS AFFECTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION LACK OF FINANCING HIGH DEVELOPMENT COSTS LOSS OF REDEVELOPMENT AGENCIES -- AND THEN FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SEEK REVIEW IS ATTRIBUTED TO TIMES. FOR THIS AS A FACTOR OUT OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR OF RESPONDENTS. IN AN COMMENTS FROM SEVENTEEN OF THE THIRTY RESPONDED SPONDON SAW SUGGESTED THAT SECRETIVE NOT CONSTRAIN HOUSING THEIR JURISDICTION FOR OTHER RESPONDENTS HAD MIXED OPINIONS. CITING MIXED SEQUEL MIXED WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT CHANT CHALLENGES AND THE NINE FELT THAT IT INDEED DID CONSTRAIN HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. WITHIN GENERALLY STAY IN THE SEQUEL ADDED TIME AND OUR COST OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS. M. LET'S SEE YEAH AND THEN THE OPINIONS ABOUT SEQUIN HOUSING PRODUCTION AND I SEEM TO VERY BY THE JURISDICTIONS HOUSING PRODUCTION INDEX RATING. ELEVEN OF THOSE SEVENTEEN RESPONDENTS FELT IT SEE COULD NOT CONSTRAIN HOUSING PRODUCTION -- WERE IN ACTUALLY BELOW AVERAGE PRODUCTION JURISDICTION SUGGESTING OTHER FACTORS WERE IMPACTING THEIR ABILITY TO PRODUCE HOUSING AND WITH THAT -- THAT'S THE END OF MY REMARKS. IS THAT REPORT AVAILABLE TO US YES YEAH IT DID -- SHOULD BE PRINTED UP AND I THINK IT'S AVAILABLE OVER HERE ON THE TABLE ALRIGHT SO PEOPLE HERE WOULD LIKE IT AND THEN OTHERS HOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO ARE LISTENING IN AND ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP A A PHYSICAL COPY. IS THERE A WEBSITE OR IS THERE SOME AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS WEBSITE. HAD PRINTED OUT A COPY LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE. IF IT SAYS IN HERE WHERE THAT WOULD BEING. I'M TOLD WE ALSO HAVE IT ON OUR JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WEBSITE YEAH FIND A UNFORTUNATELY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO SIMPLE FOR US TO SIMPLY PUT THAT WEBSITE NAME DOWN ON OUR ON OUR DOCUMENTED SO. I DON'T HAVE IT AT HAND. WE DON'T WANT TO OF BLESSED ANYONE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE PROCESS -- RIGHT LIKE TO MAKE IT COMPLICATED ALTHOUGH IT ISN'T AND I THINK THAT THE DATA FROM THIS REPORT I THINK IS. IS VERY ENLIGHTENING SO OF THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THAT TOGETHER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS THE VERY HONORABLE. JUSTICE ROBY WHO HAS BEEN. ONE OF THE EXPERTS ARE IN THIS WHOLE AND WE ARE. DELIGHTED THAT HE IS WITH US TODAY HE IS SO. HE'S REALLY -- HARD TO TALK ABOUT SOMEONE IN THE PRESENCE AND JUST REALLY BE ABLE TO PROPERLY ACKNOWLEDGE THE THE IMPACT HE'S HAD -- HE IS A HEAVILY DECORATED AND CELEBRATED JUSTICE FROM THE THIRD DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS -- HE'S AUTHORED NUMEROUS KEY OPINIONS ON C. CORE. AND ACTUALLY HELPS TO TRAIN JUDGES ON A SECRET ISSUES. AND HE'S BEEN A MEMBER OF THE COURT OF APPEALS SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A JUDGE OF THE MUNICIPAL AND SPUR COURTS OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY. FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE ON SO HE'S BEEN WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME SERVING -- IT WAS EXTRAORDINARY -- CAPACITY AND EXPERTISE -- BEFORE THAT HAD A CAREER IN WATER RE FOR THE STATE ASSEMBLY WATER COMMITTEE THAT I DO KNOW WE ARE DIGGING WAY BACK HERE. JUSTICE GOING WAY BACK -- AND AS A MEMBER AND VICE CHAIR OF THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD ALSO WAS A DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. JUSTICE ROBY CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE CHAIR OF THE SUPREME COURT COMMITTEE ON JUDICIAL ETHICS OPINIONS IT HAS ALSO TAUGHT WATER LAW AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW TO MCGEORGE SCHOOL OF LAW. PREMIER FORTY THREE YEARS. JUSTICE ROBBIE WILL TALK TO US ABOUT PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE FOR XCELERATED. JUDICIAL REVIEW OF SEE QUITE CAM WITH THAT JUSTICE ROLE WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THANK YOU SENATE JACKSON THAT WAS MORE ELABORATE AND MUCH MORE ELABORATE THAN NECESSARY BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH -- AS YOU MENTIONED I DID SERVE BOTH ON THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEAL. AND I'VE HANDLED SEQUEL CASES IN BOTH CIRCUMSTANCES SO I HAVE HAD SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THAT -- IN ADDITION -- I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE DO. TEACH OUR SECRET JUDGES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND COUNTIES OF MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE AN ANNUAL COURSE FOR NOT ONLY THE AND THEIR STAFFS SO WE DO OUR BEST TO KEEP THEM UP TO DATE AND TIMELY AND AT HEARING THESE CASES -- IN THE LEAST THOSE COUNTIES IN WHICH SECRET JUDGES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE. A COUPLE WORDS ABOUT OF WHAT WE SEE IN THAT OCCASION -- FREQUENTLY THERE IS LITIGATION OVER WHETHER AN EXEMPTION IS PROPER -- BECAUSE THAT ELIMINATES ALL SUPER REVIEWS SO OCCASIONALLY THEY'LL BE A LAWSUIT OVER WHETHER THE EXEMPTION APPLIES IN. AND IF IT IF THE SUIT NORMALLY AT THE TRIAL COURT DETERMINES THAT IT. IT DOESN'T APPLY THEM THEY WOULD NORMALLY GO BACK AND DO THE REGULAR PROCESS WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT DELAY IN THE PROCESS. ANOTHER AREA WHICH IS REALLY A FREQUENTLY. LITIGATED IS WHEN AN AGENCY USES AND THEY GET A DECLARATION RATHER THAN. AND THEN I RAIL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT FOR A NEGATIVE DECLARATION THIS IS A VERY LOW STANDARD AND THEN -- IS SOMETIMES IF YOU TAKE THREE YEARS LITIGATING WHETHER IN NEGATIVE DECORATIONS PROPER AND FIND OUT THAT IT ISN'T THEN YOU SPEND ANOTHER THREE YEARS DOING THE I. R.. SO MY ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A PROJECT THAT MIGHT HAVE CONTROVERSY. AND AND MAYBE A LARGER PROJECT AND AND GENERATE MORE. OPPOSITION IS BUILT DIRECTLY TO THE I. R. AND SAVE TIME THE THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT TOO OFTEN BUT A IF THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT ONCE THE CASE GOES TO THE COURT OF APPEAL IT'S ALL OVER SOMETIMES -- WHEN THE? WHEN THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEAL -- GOES BACK TO THE TRIAL COURT THEN THERE'S FURTHER LITIGATION OVER WHAT THE TRIAL COURT DOES THE SECOND TIME. EXCEPT THAT THE SOME SOMETIMES YOU GET MULTIPLE LAWSUITS BUT IN MOST CASES YOU DO NOT IN MOST CASES THE THE TRIAL COURT'S DECISION WHETHER IT'S UP HELD A REVERSE. NEVER NECESSARILY RESULTS IN THE OF THE MATTER BEING RESOLVED WITHOUT FURTHER LITIGATION -- BUT THERE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE THROUGH. A JUDICIAL OPINIONS AND I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT. A STREAMLINING ISSUES THAT SYSTEM FIRST OF ALL. A AS THOSE OF YOU OR YOU'RE ALL LAWYERS YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU OBJECT. TO THE RECORD FOR EXAMPLE ON THE BASIS OF PRIVILEGE LIKE ATTORNEY CLIENT OR EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE -- YOU CANNOT WAIT UNDER THE CASE LAW TILL YOU GET TO THE COURT OF APPEAL AND THEN SAY NOW. IF THE PRIVILEGE WAS IMPROPERLY INSERTED THEN WE HAVE TO START OVER AGAIN. YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BY WRIT AND SO YOU CAN'T DELAY THE PROCESS BY THAT. THE OTHER THING IS THAT IF IF A TRIAL COURT OR COURT OF APPEAL AFTER REVIEWING THE TRIAL COURT DECISION. FINDS THAT ONLY A SMALL PART OF THE I. R. IS INADEQUATE OF FOR EXAMPLE THE ANALYSIS OF RIPARIAN VEGETATION WHICH WAS IN THE AD IN THE CASE OF MINE. THE ONLY PART OF THE I. R. THAT HAS TO BE FIXED IS THE PART THAT WAS EFFECTIVE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RE WRITE THE WHOLE THING YOU KNOW YOU CAN ONLY AND YOU CAN FOCUS THEN. ON REPAIRING THAT DOING THAT MORE -- IT FAIRLY AND IN RESPONDING TO THE RED WHICH THE COURT HAS ISSUED AND THEN MOVING RIGHT ON SIMILARLY -- INJUNCTIONS IF ONE ARE IS IS ISSUED. A TO THAT PART OF THE PROJECT WHICH IS SEVERABLE. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A PARKING LOT HAVING AN ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEM THAT THERE'S A MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN ADDITION TO THE PARKING LOT. YOU CAN'T AND THE COURTS FREQUENTLY PERMIT THE PROJECT TO GO AHEAD. WITHOUT -- AS TO EVERYTHING OTHER THAN THE PART THAT WAS THE SUBJECT TO LITIGATION. AND IN THIS BY THE SAME TOKEN MANY CASES. GO RIGHT AHEAD EVEN THOUGH THE LITIGATION GOES ON IT IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE NOT ENJOYING. AND THE BEST EAMPLE LOCALLY THAT I CAN THINK OF IS IS MCANALLY VILLAGE OUT HERE RIGHT OFF OF BUSINESS. EIGHTY WHICH I HAD A LAWSUIT THE CAME TO OUR COURT AND THE I. R. WAS FOUND INADEQUATE -- THEY WENT BACK AND WAS FIXED AND THEN THE NEXT DECISION SAID IT WAS OKAY BUT MEANWHILE DURING THE ENTIRE TIME OF THIS EDUCATION THE PROJECT'S. BEEN BUILT THAT'S ALMOST COMPLETELY CONSTRUCTED YOU CAN SEE THAT. THE PROCESS IS FREQUENTLY -- NOT A PROBLEM THE OTHER THING ABOUT -- WE SHOULD WE SHOULD NOTE THAT A LOT OF CASES SIMPLY DON'T RESULT IN LAWSUIT -- AND MY FRIENDS WHO TEACH WITH ME. IN THE END WHO PRACTICE. FIND THAT OF FREQUENTLY -- CASES CAN BE RESOLVED. EITHER AFTER THE CASE HAS BEEN FILED IN COURT OR BEFORE IT'S FILED. AND I WAS TOLD BY THE LAWYER FOR THE THE WARRIORS ARENA IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT. IT WAS ORIGINALLY LOCATED IN A IN A ZONE WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO JURISDICTION OF THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. AND EVERYBODY WAS QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH THE PERMITTING FROM THE LAST COMMISSION SO THY JUST MOVE THE PROJECT SO IT NO LONGER WAS IN THE AREA THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION JURISDICTION. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT PROJECTS CAN BE MODIFIED BY THE PROPONENTS. TO LIMIT -- ON A SIMILAR SITUATION THOUGH FREQUENTLY SIGLER LAWSUITS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY LAWSUITS ON ANY OTHER SUBJECTS. OF VIOLATIONS OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING ISSUES AND AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS SO. IT CAN'T BE ASSUME THAT BECAUSE YOU MAY HAVE A LAWSUIT THAT IF YOU RESOLVE THE SEQUEL PART YOU RESOLVED ALL THE REST OF IT. AND THE THEY EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IS THE EIGHT EIGHTY ONE FIFTY SENSIBLE OF OUR CASE IN LOS ANGELES WHICH IS ONE OF THE AB NINE HUNDRED CASES WHICH THE SICK APART RESOLVED AT THE HISTORIC BUILDING PART IS NOT YET RESOLVED. SO SOMETIMES WHEN SICK WERE. IT WAS ALL OVER AND THEN THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S CAUSING PROBLEMS. I I WOULD I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU A BIT ABOUT THE AB NINE HUNDRED PROVISIONS WHICH WERE. ENACTED A FEW YEARS AGO AND IN THEIR PRESENT FORM -- THEY PROVIDE FOR RESERVE RESOLUTION OF THE LITIGATION THROUGH BOTH THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEAL. IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS AND WE AT THE COURT SYSTEM CONSISTENTLY ADVISE YOU AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO THAT THAT'S TOO SHORT. AND IT WASN'T BASED UPON -- ANY CASES BUT RATHER WAS JUST AN ARBITRARY NUMBER. WHICH CAME AND FROM HISTORICAL STANDPOINT THE LEGISLATURE IS YOU KNOW ORIGINALLY AN S. A. B. -- NINE HUNDRED PROVIDED THAT THESE CASES BE BROUGHT ORIGINALLY IN THE COURT OF APPEAL WITH ORIGINAL JURISDICTION -- AND SKIPPING THE TRIAL COURT ENTIRELY. THAT WAS CHALLENGED IN THE ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT AND AS A JUDGE OF THE ALAMEDA SUPERIOR COURT RULED THAT IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND TO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE THAT EVERYBODY SAID OKAY WELL WE'LL JUST CHANGE IT AND SO. THEY ADDED BOTH THE TRIAL COURT AND THE COURT OF APPEAL PROCESS BACK TO WHERE IT WAS BEFORE. AND BUT THE NUMBERS DIDN'T GET ADJUSTED IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER SO. WE TRY VERY HARD AND WE WILL ALWAYS TRY TO COMPLY WITH WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE'S THAT WISHES. AS OUR GOALS OR REQUIREMENTS BUT I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT THE IT'S IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR A COURT. TO MEET THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND WITH ALTHOUGH THEY ALMOST DID. AND THEY DID OKAY IN SACRAMENTO THERE ARE ACTUALLY FEWER ISSUES IN THOSE LITIGATION THEN. AND THERE MIGHT APPEAR BUT THERE IS AND SOME OF THESE AB NINE HUNDRED CASES OF ACTUALLY RESOLVE WITHOUT LITIGATION. I WAS REMINDED THAT THE APPLE CAMPUS IN CUPERTINO WAS IS ONE OF THESE AB NINE HUNDRED CASES THERE WASN'T ANY LAWSUIT I GUESS PEOPLE WERE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT. ONE BUT SO PEOPLE ACTUALLY RESOLVE THINGS AND I AND I AND ONE THING THAT MAYBE IT CAN BE DONE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I'VE TALKED ABOUT. BOTH THE CENTER ALLEN AND CENTER JACKSON IS THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO BEEF UP A LITTLE BIT THE AND MEDIATION SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE LAW. BECAUSE WE WHEN YOU SHOULD TRY TO THE OUTSIDE THE PARAMETERS OF SYKORA AND GET PEOPLE TO RESOLVE THINGS BY DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN. JUST ALLOWING THE JUDGE DO IT. WHENEVER YOU YOU HAVE THE COURT MAKE THE DECISION THE PARAMETERS AVAILABLE TO THE COURT TO MAKE THAT DECISION A MUCH MORE NARROW THAN IF YOU. IF YOU ARE FREE TO RESOLVE THE MATTER. BY ME AS A RESULT OF MEDIATION OR SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES -- BUT THERE HAVE BEEN -- I THINK. A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE WAY THE COURTS OF HANDLE THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. AND WE I THINK -- ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A LOT FEWER THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT I MEAN I MAY HAVE. A SECRET CASE ONCE EVERY COUPLE YEARS. THEY'RE NOT AS FREQUENT AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. AND WE DO OUR BEST TO GET THEM THROUGH THE TIME FRAMES WHICH IS IN THE PRESENT TIME WITH THE NINE HUNDRED PROGRAMS ARE REALLY A VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO US. TO DO. I I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU MAY HAVE RIGHT WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH OF YOU AND AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW IS OPEN THE QUESTIONS FOR MEMBERS ON THE DíAS -- TO EITHER -- JUSTICE ROBY OR MISTER RIVER SPLATTER -- AND IF WE COULD FOCUS. AGAIN ON OF THE BASIS OF THEIR TESTIMONY WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO KEEP IT IN THAT CONTEXT SO -- IF MISTER I SURE IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD. THIS MERGER WOULD YOU LIKE. TO MADAM CHAIR WHEN YOU SEE VICE CHAIRMAN NOT ACCUSTOMED. TO IN THIS JOINT SETTING BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I LIKE TO THINK -- THE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO OF PRESENT DAY THANK YOU -- FOR BEING ABLE TO MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE TO THE QUESTIONS. SO. I THINK ALL THIS CAN I JUST JUMP IN -- MY PREVIOUS CAPACITY I WAS A MEMBER OF THE A CITY COUNCIL AND THEN BORDERS WE HAD A LOT OF LAND USE. RELATED DECISIONS. HI THE AT THAT AT THAT LOCAL LEVEL. AND I THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED OVER TIME -- IS THAT SEE WHAT HAS -- FRANKENSTEIN. IN ITS APPLICATION EN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF IT IT'S FRANKENSTEIN BECAUSE INSTEAD OF IT BEING AN ENVIRONMENTAL SHIELD PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT IT HAS BECOME. A BIT OF A SORT. ROLES HAVE REVERSED OVER PERIODS OF TIME AT LEAST FROM THE INITIAL -- DESIGN ON HOW IT WAS TO BE CREATED IMPLEMENTED. AND THEN YOU HAVE. I THINK FOR RIGHT OR WRONG. A DANGEROUS MYTHOLOGY. THAT DEVELOPS. AMONGST FOLKS IN CERTAIN CAN BUILDING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT -- ENVIRONMENTAL. ON EXACTLY HOW IT IS. SO IT THREATENS. IN DISCOURAGES CERTAIN PROJECTS ROM MOVING FORWARD. WHAT I'VE SEEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHICH IS BEEN A LITTLE? UNNERVING. IS THAT -- FOLKS WHO ARE CHALLENGING A PROJECT. WELL AS ARE STEAMED -- JUSTICE HAD MENTIONED. FIND A WAY. TO FILE THE SUIT OR THREATEN TO FILE A SUIT AND BEHIND CLOSED DOORS CONCESSIONS ARE MADE. AND LO AND BEHOLD GROUPS GO AWAY THAT OTHERWISE HAD. SOME SOME SOME CHALLENGES AND SOME. PRESUMABLY MERITORIOUS CONCERNS. BUT I GUESS. WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE REPORT HERE? AND IT'S I'M LOOKING AT OUR BRIEFING. OUR LEGISLATIVE REPORT. IT TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY SIXTEEN BE A URBAN ECONOMICS. DID A QUALITATIVE QUANTITATIVE AND THE FLASH YOUR QUESTION ON ON THIS. I DON'T THINK SO NO. WHAT WHAT IS IT IN GENERAL I MAY HAVE SOME GENERAL I THINK THERE'S A STATEMENT HERE THAT I THINK SUMS UP IS THAT THE REPORT FOUND QUOTE NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT THAT SEEK REPRESENTS A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT? AND SO MY QUESTION TO YOU TO BOTH OF YOU. IS WE HAD A STATUS STATE. AND THE GOVERNOR. TALKED ABOUT THE NEED FOR A SEQUEL REFORMIST SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF HOUSING. AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY. IS THAT SEQUEL IS NOT A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TOWARD DEVELOPMENT AND THE HOUSING STOCK. DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE IT WRONG IN YOUR OPINION. I WOULDN'T WANT TO SECOND GUESS THE GOVERNOR BUT THERE. I WOULD SAY THAT SECRET AFFAIR ADVERSELY AFFECTS VERY LARGE PROJECTS CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS -- HIGH PROFILE PROJECTS BUT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY AFFECT THE GREAT GREAT MAJORITY OF PROJECTS KNOW WHAT I'D ARGUE THAT IT AFFECTS -- THERE WOULD HAVE A SAID A MAJOR EFFECT ON HOUSING PRODUCTION STATEWIDE. IT CAN BE A CERTAINLY SOMETHING IT DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM FINDING AN APPLICATION BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE PROJECT WASN'T VERY GOOD PROJECT TO BEGIN WITH IT MAY BE THAT IT HAD CONSTRAINTS ON THE THAT THEY HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT. EVEN FIFTY YEARS IN IN MY PRACTICE WE HAVE. PEOPLE WHO APPROACH US WITH THE PROJECT AND WHEN WE LOOK AT IT WE REALIZE WHAT GOSH YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON TOP OF WETLANDS AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED PERMITS FROM CALTRANS FOR A A INTERCHANGE. THE PROJECT SOMETIMES OF ALL KINDS OF CONSTRAINTS. THAT SUDDENLY POP UP DURING THE SUPER PROCESS. THOSE SORTS OF CONSTRAINTS CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO A PROJECT AS WELL SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY JUST SECRET. IT'S SOME CERTAINLY NOT OBJECT THERE FOUNDED IN THANK YOU SO IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY. THAT THERE'S OTHER EXTERNALITIES THAT BEAR AS MAJOR IMPEDIMENTS TO DEVELOPMENT. SO THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUS ON HOUSING. I UNDER THE RUBRIC OF SEQUEL REFORM IS MISPLACED. THAT IS ME I WHEN I CAN ARGUE ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR SAID WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT. SEE QUIRK AND A AS YOU INDICATED MISTER BORCHERS THERE IS A MYTHOLOGY AND WE'RE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THAT MISSED METHODOLOGY AND TO DISPEL IT TO THE EXTENT THAT. IT IS TO SPELL BOLTED TO TO LOOK AT THE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN EFFORT TO UNDERMINE. THE SEQUEL GOOD BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S A YOU WILL IN A MOMENT BECAUSE ON THE CHAIR -- IN THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN EFFORT TO UNDERMINE SEQUEL BECAUSE HE DOES IT CAN BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO A LOT OF MONEY TO BE MADE AND DEVELOPMENT SO -- THIS ISN'T ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S. OF POSITION THIS IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO GET TO THE FACTS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT IS AND IS NOT. TRUE OR REAL ABOUT SEQUENCE SO WITH THAT IN MIND PLEASE FEEL FREE TO PROCEED I WILL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THAT. ONE OF THE WAYS OF STREAMLINING. I'LL I'LL TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH. ONE OF THE WAYS OF STREAMLINING -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH SEEK WHILE I NOTICE REALLY SPEAKS VOLUMES. AND THAT IS. AN EXEMPTION. SO INSTEAD OF JUST WORKING THROUGH THE SYSTEM THERE ARE WAYS TO APPLY IT SO THAT IT DOES NOT EVEN PERTAIN TO A GIVEN PROJECT -- AND I THINK THE THE GOVERNOR AND ALL THIS IS JUST BY REFERENCE WE TALK ABOUT THE WITH THE STADIUM DOWN DOWN THE WAY -- HOW DID THAT COME ABOUT SO QUICKLY DO YOU DO YOU KNOW? THERE HAVEN'T REALLY THAT THAT'S IS ONE MYTH OF SEQUEL IS THAT THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS FOR STADIUMS THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ANY EXEMPTIONS PER SE FOR STADIUMS ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A A LIMITED EXEMPTION FOR THE OLYMPICS BACK IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS THAT THEY HAVE -- ALLOWED UDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN A PARTICULAR STATUTES HAVE BEEN PASSED ALLOW DEVELOPERS OF STADIUMS TO FRONT LOAD THE SEQUEL PROCESS THE SICK AS I MENTIONED THERE'S A REVIEW PROCESS FOR DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORTS. THEY'RE ALLOWED TO FRONT LOAD THAT PROCESS BY THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED -- THINGS LIKE THAT AND THEY'RE OFFERED A STREAMLINED LITIGATION PROCESS AT THE END OF IT TO THE HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN ANY EXEMPTIONS ABOUT EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN WIDELY USED BY -- AGENCIES ALL OVER THE STATE -- TO HELP. APPROVED INFILL DEVELOPMENT THE AS I MENTIONED THE CLASS THIRTY TWO EXEMPTION WHICH IS A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION NOT A STATUTORY ONE BUT ONE CREATED BY THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. HAS BEEN BROADLY USED. IT IS ALSO BEEN UP HELD A NUMBER OF K&lt;c.cyan&gt; A NUMBER OF TIMES AND&lt;/c&gt; AT THE COURT OF APPEAL. SO IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED. THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT EXEMPTION IS THAT IT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE EXEMPTION. IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE MAY BE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE PARTICULARS OF OF THE PROJECT SITE OF THE PROJECT ITSELF THAT SET IT APART FROM ITS SURROUNDINGS -- AND THAT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT IN FACT YOU CAN'T USE THAT EXEMPTION. THOUGH IT DOES HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ON AS I MENTIONED STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS FEWER LIMITATIONS BUT THESE CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS TO HAVE LIMITATIONS ALL FINISHED WITH MY LAST TWO QUESTIONS ON ME WILL POSE IT TO YOUR HONOR -- YOU MENTIONED THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LAWSUIT -- AND I'M WONDERING IN YOUR EXPERIENCE. DO YOU THINK THAT -- PARTIES HAVE BEEN DISCOURAGED FROM THE PROCESS -- AND THAT IS YOU WANT THAT'S REFLECTED IN AND HOW. THERE IS A RELATIVE LOWER NUMBER SIX LAWSUITS I WOULD HAVE NO IDEA I I CAN JUST TELL YOU THAT COMPARED TO THE NUMBER PROJECTS OUT THERE. THERE IS RELATIVELY SMALL LITIGATION I DO TEACH WITH SOME LAWYERS WHO DEAL WITH SICK WAY EVERY DAY. AND THEY TELL ME ANECDOTALLY OF ALL THE MATTERS THAT HAVE BEEN RESOLVED BECAUSE NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS HAVE COME TO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPER FOR EXAMPLE AND AVOIDING LITIGATION -- NO AND NOBODY REALLY WANTS THAT NOBODY WANTS TO COME TO THE COURTS IF THEY DON'T HAVE -- TO AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT IN A CAN BE EXPENSIVE AND IT'S TIME CONSUMING SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF OF OF PEOPLE WHO RESULT THINGS OUT OF COURT -- OTHERWISE IF IF EVERYTHING THAT ALL THESE LARGE NUMBERS OF OF PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY SENT ME TO SEE WHAT. WE COULDN'T EVEN OPERATE WE CAN DO ANYTHING ELSE BUT SICK WITH SO I THINK I THINK THAT IT'S TRUE THAT THERE IS A RELATIVELY. I MEAN YOU SEE. LARGE ARTICLES ABOUT IMPORTANT ONCE THEY GET CAUGHT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY IN MARIN I'M NOT IN COURT. I CAN JUST TELL YOU BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MANY CASES IT [inaudible] THAT THE THAT THE THE CASE IS THAT THE THAT THAT THAT YOU'VE STUDIED WERE THAT HAVE BEEN A PART OF THE STUDY. THAT ENDED THE ENTITLEMENT STAGE. FIVE RIGHT YEAH SO DO NOT WILL NOT NECESSARILY IT ENDED IN THE ENTITLEMENT STAGE IN THAT WE ASK THEM WHAT SORT OF ENTITLEMENTS THE THE ISSUED FOR THESE. FIVE PLUS UNIT PROJECT BUT WE DID ALSO ASK THEM -- DID THESE RESULT IN LITIGATION WHAT SORT OF LITIGATION DID YOU HAVE AN EYE SO WINNING THE RESPONSE WAS SOMEWHERE Là AROUND 1%. THAT THAT WAS RIPPED PRETTY RARE THAT THEY ACTUALLY ENDED UP IN COURT OVER OVER A PROJECT SO THAT LITIGATION OR THE THREAT OF LITIGATION. IN THE X. THE MASSIVE EXTENSIONS THAT WOULD NORMALLY. GO ALONG WITH A POST ENTITLEMENT -- JUDICIAL REVIEW WERE NOT CALCULATED THE TIME LINE -- FOR THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT IN GENERAL NO NO WANTING TO TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT WE DON'T KNOW. HOW THE THREAT OF A BIG OF A LAWSUIT -- LITIGATION AFFECTS THINGS BECAUSE ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND THOUGH IS THAT ONCE A PROJECT IS. APPROVED -- AND IN WHAT'S CALLED A NOTICE OF THE TERMINATION IS BEEN FILE THERE'S ONLY A THIRTY FIVE DAY STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS FOR SOMEONE TO BRING A LAWSUIT. SO SECRET DOES HAVE A RELATIVELY SHORT STATURE LIMITATIONS PERIOD -- THAT MAY IN SOME WAYS DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WHO WORK SORT OF LATE ARRIVALS -- WHO MAY HAVE SOME MISCHIEF IN MIND FROM FILING LAWSUITS BECAUSE IF THEY HAVEN'T FOLLOWED THE PROJECT ALL ALL ALONG THROUGH THE PROCESS? THIRTY DAYS MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TIME FOR THEM TO PREPARE FOR THIS BUT THE STATEMENT OF SEE WHAT NOT BEING A MAJOR BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT. EXCLUDES THE TIME PERIOD THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE POST ENTITLEMENT LITIGATION BECAUSE IN THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THOSE NUMBERS THOSE WOULD BE REFLECTED THE NUMBERS YEAH. YEAH BECAUSE WE DID ASSN ABOUT LITIGATION AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE HAD BEEN LITIGATION NOT THAT THAT'S NOT MY QUESTIONS THE TIMELINE EXTENSION BECAUSE OF LITIGATION. IS THAT PRESUPPOSED IN THE STATEMENT THAT IT'S NOT A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT RIGHT I DON'T KNOW WE DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE BUT ALL IN MY THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR HILL. THANK YOU HAVE A CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR -- THE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING A LOT OF THAT THE PRESENTATION I WAS IN ANOTHER HEARING AND I APPRECIATE THE THE TITLE OF OUR JOINT HEARING TODAY YOU KNOW JUST THE FACTS AND EVIDENCE BASED LOOK AT SEQUENT THEN THE MYTHOLOGY. PART OF THIS OF THE I'M. WHICH STRONG. STRONG SHE WAS SUPPORTER -- IN IN LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS IN THE INFORMATION WHICH WAS EXCELLENT AND BASED ON THE FACT AND I THINK THE GENERAL JUST MENTION THAT TO AND YOU'VE INDICATED THERE ARE VERY FEW LAWSUITS THAT COME ABOUT -- THROUGH SHE QUOTE. OF AND I'D LOOK AT ALL OF THE REVIEWS THAT SHE COULD DOES INVITE STATICS AGRICULTURE EVERYTHING THAT IS DISCUSSED AND LOOKED AT BUT WHAT. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS IN IN GOVERNMENT FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. CITY COUNTY STATE AND IN THE AREA THAT I'VE WITNESSED I'VE SEEN VERY FEW ACTUAL LAWSUIT. GOING FORWARD -- BUT WHAT I HAVE WITNESSED THAT I THINK IT SHOULD FOR THE FACTS. IN THE FAX TO ME ARE THAT. YOU FIND IN A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. THAT IS IT COMES BEFORE THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. IT WILL HAVE. A SEQUEL REVIEW OF SOME KIND OF VISION NEGATIVE DECK OR OR ANY AYE ARE IN GENERALLY ARE. IN ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'LL HAVE THIS THESE CONVERSATIONS THAT WILL GO ON AND I SUPPORT PROJECT LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH LABOR BUT THAT SEEMS TO BE A MAJOR. TOOL WHICH USED TO GAIN. SOME CONCESSIONS FROM THE DEVELOPER. IN LIEU OF THE TWO YEARS HOLDING COSTS FOR LAND EVERYTHING ELSE IT WOULD GO THROUGH THE COST IN THE TIME THAT WOULD GO. FOR THAT -- IS AVOID IN AND THEY SETTLED IN SOME FORM SAME WITH SOME OF THE IT ANTI COMPETITIVE ISSUES WHERE YOU HAVE A BUSINESS YEAR IN A BUSINESS THERE. WILL THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU'LL HAVE A CONSIDERATION THERE OR ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY I LOVE. LOVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SOME CASES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T QUITE GET WHAT THEY WANTED OUT OF THAT HE AYE ARE. THAT THEY WILL THREATEN A LAWSUIT. AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS LATER OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY WOULD BE A SETTLEMENT AND EVERYONE WALKS AWAY. TO SEE COULD DOES WORK THERE ONLY VERY THERE ARE VERY FEW LAWSUITS THAT COME ABOUT AND VERY CHALLENGES. BUT IT'S THAT SIDE OF FACT. IT SEEMS TO BE THE THE THE THE REALITY FOR MANY BUSINESSES I DON'T THINK IT'S A MYTH -- AND AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET AROUND THAT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IT I JUST THOUGHT PERHAPS BECAUSE OF YOUR BROAD EXPERIENCES YOU MAY HAVE A WAIT. TO TO IT TO GET THIS PROCESS TO MOVE IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY EVEN THOUGH IT DOESN'T AND ISN'T INVOLVED IN THE PERHAPS THE THE LEGAL SIDE OF IT [inaudible] AT FIRST. YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES UP I GUESS AND I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT THE WHOLE IDEA OF STANDING WHO HAS STANDING. TO BRING A SEQUEL LAWSUIT CAN CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IF YOU LOOK AT NEED FOR THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT VERSUS SEQUEL -- AND HOW LITIGATION GOES ON SEE WHAT. THAT'S ONE OF THE FIRST DEFENSES OF THE FEDERAL AGENCY WILL RAISE IS THAT. THE POTENTIAL LITIGANT DOESN'T HAVE STANDING. AND SO THERE AREN'T AS MANY NEED THE CASES AND CERTAINLY NOT AS MANY SUCCESSFUL NEED THE CASES AS THERE ARE SECRET CASE EQUALIZATION AGAINST AGENCIES -- SO. HAS VERY BROAD STANDING A FEW AT A TAKE -- YOU NEED. YOUR PART OF THE PROCESS. YOU'RE TAKING ACTIONS ON THE BASIS OF ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND ESSENTIALLY YOU HAVE STANDING. SO THAT MIGHT BE. ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WE THAT WE HAVE THIS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO DO BOTH TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE SAME TIME LIMIT STANDING IF WE WANT CALIFORNIA'S VINYL QUALITY BACK. TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST. CALIFORNIA'S LAWS ON STANDING ORDER IN ALL AREAS NOT JUST SEE BECAUSE I'M MUCH BROADER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE FEDERAL LITIGATION. AND THAT INCLUDES ANY KIND OF LITIGATION ISSUE THE TO SEQUOIA. THE ONE THING THAT IS IMPORTANT -- AND THE COURTS VERY STRICTLY -- REQUIRE YOU TO EXHAUST YOUR MYSTERY REMEDIES UNDER SYKORA. SO YOU HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY IN THE VERY BEGINNING YOU HAVE TO RAISE YOUR POINTS WELL YOU CAN'T RAISE THEM ON APPEAL. YOU CAN'T REASON AT THE TRIAL COURT AND FOR THAT MATTER -- AND SO -- IT WE DO THAT LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE CASES ON REGULARLY ON ON FAILING TO EXHAUST -- AND THAT THAT THAT CAN BE AND YOU HAVE TO EXHAUST BY RAISING AN ISSUE. YOU CAN'T JUST SAY I'M GONNA MAKE MENTION ONE ISSUE NOW WHEN I GET. ON APPEAL I CAN RAISE NINE MORE YOU AT YOUR LIMITED TO THE ACTUAL ISSUES YOU RAISED BEFORE THE AGENCY BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS BUT WHEN THE COURT THE BOTH THE TRIAL COURT AND THE APPELLATE COURT. WE REVIEW THE AGENCY'S DECISION AND FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE COURT OF APPEAL REVIEWS A CASE WE SKIP OVER THE TRIAL COURT AND WE GO DIRECTLY TO THE AGENCY AND SAY. DID THE AGENCY DO IT RIGHT I MEAN IT'S ALWAYS USEFUL TO HAVE A TRIAL COURT'S RULING TO HELP US BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT THEY DID BUT SO. YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE HAPPENS IN COURT. SENATOR Y. KOWSKI. JUST FOR CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME NON LAWYERS HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STANDING TO LARGER ENVIRONMENTAL REFER THE VIEW PROCESS I THINK THERE AT THAT. A MISC AND DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE SEEK WHAT PROCESS WHICH IS THE GOLDEN WORDS AND THE CLEAN AIR ACT THE CLEAN WATER ACT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT AND THE UNDERLYING LAW THAT PEOPLE USE WHEN WE HAVE THIS. ONE TENT EXPOSURE TO WHAT THE PROJECT IS I MEAN THEY THEY HAVE STANDING IN FROM THE CITY COUNCIL FROM THE COUNTY FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE IS JUST IF THEY WANT TO FILE A SUIT. THAT'S A VERY NARROW. TIME IN THE DEBATE TO GET. ANY IS HAS A IT HAS A LEGAL. LEGAL DEFINITION RIGHT AND IT'S BUT CALIFORNIA STANDING IS BROUGHT IF YOU WANT TO BRING A CHALLENGE TO A WATER BOARD DECISION OR YOUR BOARD DECISION STANDING IS WATER IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE UNDER FEDERAL LAW. I GUESS. MR VILLA SPATA -- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE DO LEGISLATURE'S WE HAVE A HODGE PODGE OF LEGISLATION YOU MENTIONED CAUGHT MY ATTENTION DO WE DON'T HAVE HARMONIZATION? OF THE LEGISLATION BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THIS OUTCRY OR SOMEBODY GETS ELECTED TO THE CENTER OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THEY WANT TO REFORM SAKE. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT IT DOES BUT THEY JUST WANT TO REFORM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO GET DONE AND CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SOME EXAMPLES MAYBE YOUR HONOR. THAT SO IT HELPS US BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF OF DEALING WITH THIS THE ILLUSION OF BILLS ARE GONNA BE INTRODUCE. HAD TO DO AND GIVE US SOME IDEAS OF WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS LACK OF HARMONY -- FROM THE LEGISLATURE. TELL TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF TEARING TEARING IS THIS AT THE IDEA THAT ONCE YOU'VE DONE AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR A PROJECT THEN LATER ACTIVITIES UNDER THAT SAME PROJECT CAN USE THAT ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AS THEIR SEEK ONE ELSE. UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING NEW RELATED TO THAT LATER ACTIVITY -- ORDERS -- SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE IMPACT RELATING TO THAT NEW ACTIVITY SO RATHER THAN REINVENTING THE WHEEL DO YOU USE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL DOCKED AND JUST FOCUS IN ON ON WHAT'S NEW. THE LATEST SET OF SECRET STREAMLINING HIS LOOK AT THAT IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAYS. IN SOME CASES -- YOU LOOK AT NOT WHAT'S NEW BUT WHAT IS QUOTE UNQUOTE PECULIAR TO THE PROJECT. SO RATHER THAN JUST LOOKING AT NEW AND MORE SEVERE IMPACTS OF WILL IS THE IMPACT PECULIAR TO THE PROJECT -- AND ARE THERE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THAT WOULD HELP AVOID THAT IMPACT -- THERE BY BRINGING IT DOWN TO A LEVEL I GUESS OF LESS THAN PECULIAR WHATEVER THAT WOULD BE -- SO THERE'S DIFFERENCES IN NORMAN FRANCES IN WHERE THEY APPLY. OTHERS ALSO DIFFERENCES IN THE TYPES OF STANDARDS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO A PROJECT AS I MENTIONED THAT SB. TWO TWENTY SIX LEGISLATION HAS A NUMBER OF STATE STANDARDS IN YOUR PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO MEET I WE'RE AS NO OTHER FORM OF TEARING HAS ANY ANY STATE STANDARDS AT ALL. SO IT VARIES A LOT AND IF IT WERE IF WE HAD SOMETHING THAT WOULD APPLY -- IN A MORE GENERALIZED MANNERS SOMETHING THAT'S RELATIVELY SIMPLE. MAYBE SOMETHING BUILDING ON WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. MY GUESS IS THAT THAT WOULD COME INTO GREATER USE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT IS THE CHANGE MADE BY SB SEVEN FORTY THREE TO THE USE OF SPECIFIC PLANNING AYE OURS. UNDER UP PRIOR LAW AND EXISTING LAW I ONCE YOU'VE DONE ANY AYE ARE FOR SPECIFIC PLAN AND RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS BETTER CONSIST OF THE SPECIFIC PLAN DON'T NEED ADDITIONALLY I ARE UNLESS THERE'S A NEW IMPACT A MORE SEVERE IMPACT. SB SEVEN FORTY THREE EXPANDED THAT. ALL TO ALSO INCLUDE -- CERTAIN SORTS OF MIXED USE PROJECTS AND WHAT WOULD YOU CALL OF JOB PRODUCING PROJECTS -- AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS AS LONG AS THEY WERE LOCATED WITHIN A TRANSIT PRIORITY AREAS SO WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR PART OF THE STATE IT EXPANDED THAT. THE BEAUTY OF IT IS IS THAT THERE IS CASE LAW ON HOW SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE TO USE THERE'S A LOT OF EXPERIENCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ONE HOUSE SPECIFIC PLAN HE I ARE AS YOU USE. AND SO BY SIMPLY ADDING THIS WHICH IS EASILY DEFINED. YOU'VE NOW EXPANDED THE USE OF IT TO ALSO COVER A MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT AS AN INFILL PROJECT -- YOU KNOW JOB PRODUCERS AS AN INFILL PROJECT. RELATIVELY SIMPLY. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT USE I I HAVEN'T PERSONALLY SEEN THAT USE BUT I I'M EXPECTING THAT TO BE USED. PRETTY SIMPLE THE COURTS OF APPEAL TEND TO PUBLISH OPINIONS ON SEAQUEST. THE WITH GREATER FREQUENCY THAN PERHAPS OTHER SUBJECTS FOR THE SOLE REASON IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS THE LAW AND THE COURTS GIVE GUIDANCE. RIGHT AWAY ON ANY NEW PROVISIONS SO -- LEASE MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN -- THAT WE PUBLISH A LOT MORE BECAUSE ALMOST EVERYONE WE DO IS A NEW ISSUE IT'S SOMETHING THAT ASSN THIS. HASN'T BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE ONE OF THINGS I FAILED TO MENTION AND I WAS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT STREAMLINING IS THAT. SENATE JACKSON DID HAVE A A BILL THAT REQUIRED THE REQUIRES THE PREPARATION OF THE RECORD SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE WITH THE PROJECT BEING. RUN THROUGH THE SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO EVERYBODY AND AND IT COULD BE EXPANDED TO TWO OTHER PRO PROJECTS BEYOND THE ONES AT THE PLACE TO NOW. AND I AND I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT THE PREPARATION OF THE RECORD IS ONE OF THE BIG BOTTLENECKS IN. IN THE TIMING OF SEQUEL LITIGATION -- AND UNDER THE LAW THE AGENCY OR THE PETITIONER CAN PREPARE THE RECORD - I THINK YOU COULD -- YOU COULD CHANGE THOSE PROVISIONS TO MAKE RECORDS GET DONE MORE QUICKLY -- IT WHEN PETITIONERS DO THE RECORD FREQUENTLY -- YOU WE GET PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AT THE TRIAL COURTS IN ORDER TO HELP THE PETITIONER DEVELOP THE RECORD. AND IT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IS A JUDGE THAT WHY SHOULD WE BE DEALING WITH. SEQUEL LAWSUITS AND ALSO PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST I MEAN I THINK THERE ARE EASIER WAYS OF DOING IT. SO THOSE THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE I THINK I AM. THIS SENATE JACKSON DIDN'T WANT US TO SAY HOW TO FIX THINGS BUT AND A COUPLE THINGS THAT FROM A JUDICIAL STANDPOINT. THAT COULD BE FIXED AND AND THE ONE THAT HAS THE SIMULTANEOUS RECORD DEVELOPMENT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW. SB NINE HUNDRED APPLIES WHEN THE RECORDS AVAILABLE. AND SOMETIMES THERE ARE ACTUAL LAWSUITS OVER AND SO -- UNFORTUNATELY YOU GET SOME ANCILLARY ISSUES THAT DON'T ACTUALLY DEAL WITH WHETHER SEQUEL IS BEING VIOLATED OR NOT. WELL JUST A STROKE I'M NOT GONNA COR WITH YOUR CORRECTING THE MISTAKES OR PERHAPS THE LIMITATIONS OF MY LEGISLATION. FOR DO YOU BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT BILL BUT I MEAN AND I THINK THAT THE TIME THERE WAS A FEELING THAT SOME AGENCIES DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY RIGHT -- YOU KNOW THE TO ELECTRONICALLY DO ALL THIS BUT I THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED AS TIME GOES BY I MEAN. WE EVEN AT OUR COURTLY FILE ELECTRONICALLY NOW. IF IT IS DOES ACTUALLY REDUCE THE TIME FRAME IF IT'S CONTEMPORANEOUSLY PREPARED UP TO A YEAR OR SO IT REDUCES SAVE A LOT OF TIME YEAH. WHICH WAS HAVE LAST QUESTION I GUESS THE THE OTHER SIDE OF IT BECAUSE OF EVERYBODY WANTS TO FOCUS ON STREAMLINING. SEQUEL BUT WE HAVE THE BASE THE THE UNDERLYING A LOT THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCESACT A. B. -- THE AIR CLEAN AIR ACT HAS THERE BEEN ANYTHING THAT'S COME TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT SAYS THERE'S SOME CONFUSION. AT THE APPLICATION OF THE UNDERLYING LAW WHEN YOU HAVE THIS PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS THAT WE MAY NOT. WE HAVE THIS. THANKS THAT IS. SENATOR THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE FREQUENTLY ARM ARE MULTIPLE LAWSUITS FILED ON A SINGLE PROJECT. ONE GROUP MAY FILE SEQUEL LOSSES ON A ALSO FOLLOW SOMEONE ELSE LAWSUIT. AND WHAT THEY'RE WE ALWAYS CONSOLIDATE THEM AT THE COURTS OF APPEAL AND ACTUALLY AT THE TRIAL COURT'S THE CHIEF JUSTICE. OF CAN PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND PUT A BEFORE ONE JUDGE AND THAT'S A STANDARD PROCEDURE. BUT IT DOES HAPPEN. JUST LIKE THAT EIGHTY ONE FIFTY CASE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES WHERE THE SECRET CASES ALL OVER AND THE OTHER ONE STILL THERE. BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE ONE JUDGE. HANDLING IT AS OR ONE COURT OF APPEAL HANDLING IT -- AND THAT THAT'S A TOOL THAT THE BRANCH USES JUST TO KEEP US. SANE ABOUT HOW TO HANDLE THESE THINGS. I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION -- CENTER CUBBY ERA PLEASE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN I APPRECIATE THE SAID THE TESTIMONY IN THE INFORMATION YOU'VE GIVEN AND I I AM. I WANNA ALSO SAY THAT I'M A VERY STRONG SECRET SUPPORTER I'VE I HAVE FOR YEARS -- BUT I'VE ALSO SPENT THIRTY YEARS -- MEANT AND FIFTEEN YEARS AT A LOOK AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT LOOKING AT GENERAL PLANS AND AND LOOKING AT PROJECTS SO. I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT. THINGS MAY HAVE SHIFTED. OVER THOSE THIRTY YEARS -- BUT THE VIGNETTES ARE STILL THERE WITH ME AS I DO MY WORK BECAUSE I WANT IT AND AND I'M AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT -- MISTER AT RIVETS PLOT THAT. YOUR FIRST FINDING ON I AM IN YOUR SECRET DOCUMENT IS THAT THE THAT THE THAT YOU'RE LED TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT A DISCERNIBLE PATTERN. IN TERMS OF SYKORA THE WAY SICK WHAT IS -- THE ANECDOTES ABOUT SEQUOIA CAUSING PROJECT WITHDRAWALS ARE POTENTIALLY ACCURATE FOR SINGULAR HIGH PART HIGH PROFILE PROJECT DO NOT REPRESENT AN OVERALL DISCERNIBLE PENNER. AND I'M I'M WONDERING -- WITH THAT KIND OF A STATEMENT -- ONE OF THE THINGS I LEARNED IN STATISTICS IS THAT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU STUDY AND IN ORDER TO MAKE IT MAKE YOUR STATEMENTS -- IN THIS. THE CITY OF SALINAS IS TWENTY MILES FROM MONTEREY PENINSULA SO WERE CONSIDERED A COASTAL COMMUNITY DESPITE THAT THE FACT THAT OUR ECONOMICS. ARE RURAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY. AND I I IN IN THE YEAR. WE APPROVED CLOSE TO TWO THOUSAND FOUR DOUBLE HOUSING UNITS AND THEY WERE. HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL -- AND THEY WERE THE NASTIEST MEETINGS THAT WE EVER HELD WAS AROUND. THE FEAR THAT PEOPLE HAVE THAT THEIR OWN VALUES ARE GOING TO BE -- AFFECTED BY THEY WERE LOW INCOME AND POOR FARM WORKER HOUSING PROJECTS. AND BOND THAT THE SEQUEL A THREATS. SOME OF WHICH RESULTED IN LITIGATION AND SOME WHICH JUST RESULTED IN THREATS THAT -- FORCED. DEVELOPERS TO DECIDE WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD OR NOT -- WERE REAL IN MY COMMUNITY AND SO THAT THEY THINK THAT THE CHALLENGE FOR ME AND BELIEVING THAT THERE'S IT HAS SUCH A LOW IMPACT IS IT WHEN I LOOK AT THE CITIES THAT HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN SOME OF THE OTHER REPORTS. THEY'RE THE BIG CITIES THEY'RE NOT RURAL AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO OUR PROXIMITY. TO A VERY HIGH COST. VERY ALIKE WHERE THERE'S A LACK OF DIVERSITY AND WHERE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GETS DUMPED ON POOR -- LATINO MAJORITY COMMUNITIES THAT SETS UP. A SITUATION WHERE. PEOPLE CAN COME AND TRY TO TELL US WHAT TO DO IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY AND USED THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT -- OF OF OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS TO HOUSE THE WORK FORCE. AGAINST US AND SO LIKE I SAID I WE WE MITIGATED ALL THE SECRET ISSUES BUT OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAD TO FACE AND AND MORE RECENTLY. THERE WAS A PROJECT THAT WAS DEVELOPED ON A FORMALLY INDUSTRIAL -- UNTOUCHED REAL SIDE WAS THE SPRECKELS -- SUGAR FACTORY AND THE PROJECT BY -- AN AG COMPANY AND THEY TOOK NOTE THE USE NO. PUBLIC FUNDS ALL THEIR OWN MONEY AND THEY WERE SUED UNDER SYKORA. YEAH IN MONTEREY COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT AND ULTIMATELY THEY BUILT THE PROJECT BECAUSE THEY THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO TO WAIT. AND THIS THE SUIT WAS -- WEST WEST WAS SETTLED FINALLY FOR PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR BECAUSE THEY HAD MOVED FORWARD AND THEY BUILT IT AND IT HAD A NEW FRANKLY HAD NO IMPACT IF YOU CAN'T EVEN SEE IT FROM ANY ROADS BECAUSE OF WHERE IT'S LOCATED SO. MY CONCERN IS THAT IN MY REGION IN IN IN THAT IN THAT SALINAS VALLEY -- SEQUOIA HAS BEEN USED REPEATEDLY AS A WAY FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES TO COME IN AND TO SO SO ONE IS. IT HAS HAD AN IMPACT IN MINUTES COUGH IT'S COST US A LOT IN TERMS OF FORD WILL HOUSING PROJECTS IN TO THE FACT THAT THE THE PEOPLE WHO CAN SUE THAT HAVE STANDING. IS SO BROAD THAT THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE FROM OUR COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AND I'M I'M WONDERING -- ESTES ROBBIE IF IF IF IF THAT'S ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF EITHER COMPETITORS OR PEOPLE FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES OR OR WHO JUST HAVE A POLICY WHO HAVE A THE ATTITUDE THAT THEY'D CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T REALLY GROW ANYMORE. WELL I YOU KNOW CENTER I DIE THERE ARE LIMITS TO STANDING I DON'T THINK YOU CAN YOU HAVE TO BE A A YOU HAVE TO SHOW THAT YOU HAVE AN INTEREST ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY IT. ANOTHER WHICH NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T THINK -- I I THINK THAT WE WOULD REJECT STANDING ON SOMEBODY FROM ANOTHER TOWN ALTHOUGH I MIGHT ADD THAT UNDER THE LAW NOW A TOWN CHANCE TO A NEIGHBORING TOWN SO -- WE DO SOMETIMES GET LITIGATION BETWEEN COMPETING COMMUNITIES BUT I WOULD THINK THAT THE THE MOST RULINGS ON STANDING WOOD. WELL IT'S BEEN MORE BROAD THAN THE FEDERAL -- IT'S NOT THAT BROAD I MEAN I YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A LOCAL PERSON WHO LIVE NEARBY. OR REGULARLY USE THE ROADS OR ARE SOMEHOW CONNECTED THEMSELVES TO THE PROJECT SO THEY CAN ASSERT AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ADVERSE TO THEMSELVES. YOU HAVE TO MAKE THAT CLEAR IF YOU AND I THINK THE STANDING QUESTIONS ONE THAT WE'VE GOT TO CLARIFY. I ONE QUESTION JUST BY WAY OF CLARIFICATION THEN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. YOU WOULD EARLIER TALKED I THINK -- MYSTERY THE SPLATTER ABOUT -- OTHER THERE ARE OTHER REASONS THAT PEOPLE WALK AWAY FROM OR DEVELOPERS WALK AWAY FROM PROJECTS AND THAT TOO BECAUSE A SMALL. FRAGMENT OF THAT -- I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED A DEVELOPER RELATED REASONS AND NON SEQUEL OPPOSITION I THINK YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT FUNDING ISSUES -- I THINK YOU ALSO MENTION HIGH DEVELOPER FEES. AND THE LACK OF AVAILABLE SITES WOULD YOU ARE JUST CLARIFY -- ARTICULATE FOR US THESE PROBLEMS AS GREATER PROBLEMS IN THE CURRENT DEVELOPMENT -- WORLD THEN THE SORT OF THE STANDARD SEQUEL WHIPPING BOY. APPROACH OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL OF EQUAL CONCERN. YEAH IT REALLY VARIES BY JURISDICTION AND I DON'T HAVE THE BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE OF ELEMENT DOING THIS FORTY YEARS OR SO -- SO I DON'T REALLY HAVE THE BREADTH OF EXPERIENCE TO KNOW BUT IT IT VARIES A LOT BY JURISDICTION AND AND PART OF IT IS -- AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED CENTER COMING OUT OF THAT -- YOU KNOW THEY MAY BE THE IMPRESSION OR THERE MAY BE A PAST HISTORY IN THAT COMMUNITY OF LAWSUITS WHICH TEND TO DISK. PEOPLE -- BUT THERE MAY ALSO BE HIGH IMPACT FEES -- HIGHLAND COSTS TO BEGIN WITH -- COST OF CONNECTING IN A YOUR PARTICULAR PROJECT WHATEVER UTILITIES ARE ECESSARY YOUR PROJECT MAYBE SOME DISTANCE FROM EXISTING UTILITIES AT A HIGH EOUGH DENSITY THAT REQUIRES SEWER LINES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. TO THE FULL VARIETY OF OTHER COSTS THE ONE WHO WANTED TO BUILD ON A GREEN FIELD SITE THAT'S CURRENTLY NOT WITHIN THE CITY AND NOW YOU HAVE TO ANNEX IT TO THE CITY. YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS THAT POP UP -- AS WELL AS SEEK WITH A CAN. NOT NECESSARILY SAND AWAY BUT THE PART OF THE PROCESS OF GOING TO AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF PERMITS THAT YOU NEED FROM THE YOU KNOW THE NUMBER OF AGENCIES AND HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET PERMITS AND ALL THAT SORT OF THING. IN THOSE VERY BY VARIOUS COMMUNITY HISTORY BY CREATE THEIR OWN JURISDICTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH VERY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY BEING WITH US HOPEFULLY IT'S GIVEN US MORE. FOOD FOR THOUGHT AND ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOUR WISDOM AND EXPERTISE IN THOSE AREAS SENATOR ALLEN. YEAH SO THE NEXT PANEL ACTUALLY WILL TOUCH UPON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE WITH THE REST ABOUT THE WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT SEA WAS WRONG DEVELOPMENT. AND WE'VE GOT THREE FANTASTIC. MEMBERS OF THE FACULTY AT UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW WHICH IS MY ALMA MATER. ASSEMBLY YEAH THEY MUST BE VERY. PARTICULARLY WELL QUALIFIED -- I WANT TO START OF COURSE THERE BY. I'VE EVER VESTED BY RIGHT HAD A BIG GUY WAS A BIG. FAN OF HIS BECAUSE HE WROTE A BLOG POST THAT -- SUPPORTED. OUR RATHER CREATIVE -- PUBLIC LANDS BILL THAT WE PASSED. A YEAR TO GO. ON ANY TALK ABOUT HOW IT AND COULD FIND ITS WAY. TOWARD SUCCESS AND AND IN OUR STEAM FEDERAL JUDICIARY. UNFORTUNATELY. WE WE YOU KNOW WE WE TOOK A WE TOOK A RISK AND AND AND AND THAT THE COURTS WERE NOT QUITE AS SAYING WHAT ABOUT OUR BILL. BUT Là PEEL SENATOR STILL A CHANCE FOR AN APPEAL THAT'S CORRECT SO SO HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE. DO ALSO APPRECIATE. I ARGUED THAT VIBER IS PROFESSOR OF LAW AT A DID YOU SEE BERKELEY WE ALSO GOT MORE O'NEILL. WHO IS A SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW FROM THE CENTER FOR LAW ENERGY IN THE ENVIRONMENT? ADD TO ADD AT THE LAW SCHOOL AND THEN ALSO I JULIA GLUSHKO NELSON. WHO'S AN ASSOCIATE FROM THE CENTER FOR LINER TO INVITE YOU BEING HERE AND I AGREE SIR THE PROFESSOR BY HER. RIGHT AND ACTUALLY THINK MORE -- OKAY YOU'LL TAKE THE LEAD AND THEN -- TULIP WALKING ALSO PRESENT ACTON WHERE I AND THEN BACK TO ME OKAY GREAT WELL WE'LL START WITH YOU AB [inaudible] YEAH. THANK YOU OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE RESEARCH WITH YOU MY NAME IS MORE O'NEILL AND AS YOU NOTED MY TITLE I MET BERKELEY LAW CENTER FOR LAW AND RG ENVIRONMENT AT AND AT THE INSTITUTE. FOR URBAN AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT. AND ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GONNA DO IS DISCUSS FIRST THE AIM OF OUR STUDY SO RECOGNIZING THE PERSISTENCE AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. COMBINED WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE GOAL OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN TO STUDY WHETHER STATE OR LOCAL LAW MY CONSTRAINED DENTS IN FILL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND IF SO WHICH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MIGHT BE AT ISSUE. SO WE ENTERED INTO THIS WORK RECOGNIZING THAT OTHERS HAD FOUND INDIRECT EVIDENCE THAT LAND USE LAW GENERALLY. MIGHT BE IN CONTRIBUTING TO OUR HOUSING CRISIS THROUGH THE IMPOSITION OF DELAYS INTELLECT DEVELOPMENT BUT WE ALSO SAW THAT THERE WAS VERY LITTLE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. THAT COULD IDENTIFY WHICH LAWS SPECIFICALLY WERE IT ISSUE SO JULIA WILL BEGIN WITH DISCUSSING OUR METHODS I WILL THEN TURN TO SOME KEY FINDINGS AND AIRPORT DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS. GREAT I'M SO I WANT TO START BY EXPLAINING HOW WE GATHERED OUR DATA AND OUR RESEARCH METHODS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT. THESE METHODS REALLY ILLUSTRATE THE FULL COMPLEXITY OF THIS ISSUE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO FIRST I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE OUR OVERALL RESEARCH CLUED BY SHARING SOME OF THE EXISTING DATA LIMITATIONS. SO AS A STARTING POINT THIS WORK INVOLVED COLLECTING DIFFERENT KINDS OF DATA AND FOUR FOUR PHASES. OUR FIRST PHASE INVOLVES SELECTING OUR CITIES FOR STUDY AND THEN SUMMARIZING ALL OF THE LAW APPLICABLE TO RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND THAT'S BOTH LOCAL AND STATE LAW. THIS INCLUDED LAWS APPLICABLE TO LAND USE ZONING AND LAND DEVELOPMENT MORE GENERALLY. UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL LAND USE PROCESS AND HOW AND WHEN SEEK WELL PLIES IS AN ESSENTIAL FIRST STEP. TO BEGIN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN APPROVE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND ONE OF TWO WAYS THEY CAN ALLOW SOME TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT TO PROCEED AS OF RIGHT. OR APPLY A DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROCESS TO OTHER TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT. IN THE AS OF RIGHT CONTEXT IF THE PROPOSED PROJECT MEETS ALL THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF THE LOCAL ZONING CODE AND THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS LIKE HEIGHT PARKING AND DENSITY. THE DEVELOPER IT DIRECTLY APPLIES TO GET A BUILDING PERMIT. A SIMPLE EXAMPLE OF THIS FOR INSTANCE IS ITS OWN THAT ALLOWS A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WITH THE ONE STORY MAXIMUM. AND A TWO THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT MINIMUM AS LONG AS THE HOUSE FALLS WITHIN THIS BUILDING ENVELOPE IT'S AS OF RIGHT AND CAN PROCEED DIRECTLY TO A BUILDING PERMIT. ON THE OTHER HAND CITIES CAN REQUIRE THAT PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT BE SUBJECT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. THEIR IMAGINATIVE OLIVER OWNS LAND THAT IS OWNED FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES BUT WANTS TO BUILD AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. THE DEVELOPER NEEDS TO GET THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO REZONE THE PROPERTY AND THAT REQUIRES A FULL DEBATE -- AND DECISION MAKING PROCESS BY THE CITY COUNCIL. BUT THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE A CITIES BASED ON IN THE AREA BUT THE CODE MAY STILL REQUIRE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO MAKE FINDINGS OF THE PROJECT -- MEETS CERTAIN PRESCRIBED STANDARDS THIS IS OFTEN CALLED A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT OR C. U. P.. FINALLY AND THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DISTINCTION FOR STUDY EVEN WHERE PROJECTS MIGHT OTHERWISE FIT THE BASE ZONING SAY THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN THE SINGLE FAMILIES OWN EXAMPLE. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT MIGHT STILL REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF THIS OUR DESIGNER ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW WHERE THE PROJECT MUST MEET CERTAIN AESTHETIC STANDARDS EVEN THOUGH IT COMPLIES WITH THE UNDERLYING ZONING CODE. UNDERSTANDING HOW SEQUEL OPERATES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF THIS PHASE OF RESEARCH AND WE JUST GOT A REALLY EXCELLENT -- INTRODUCTION TO SEAQUEST SO I WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS VERY QUICKLY BUT JUST TO REITERATE A FEW KEY POINTS -- YOU KNOW WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF SEE WHERE THEY USUALLY ENVISIONED LARGE DETAILED REPORTS ABOUT ALL SORTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. ACCOMPANIED BY PUBLIC HEARINGS AND THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW IS AN NINE BUYER MENTAL IMPACT REPORT OR ANY AYE ARE. BUT SEE WHAT PERMITS OTHER FORMS OF COMPLIANCE INCLUDING STREAMLINING -- WHICH ALLOWS THE DEVELOPER TO PROPOSE A PROJECT THAT TEARS OFF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COMPLETED. SOMETIMES A DEVELOPER MAY ALSO -- PROPOSING AGREED TO MITIGATE YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THROUGH WHAT'S CALLED MITIGATING NEGATIVE DECLARATION OR IN MND. AND SOME PROJECTS MAY BE EXEMPT FROM ANY ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW. THESE CATEGORICALLY EXAM PROJECTS UNDERSTANDING HOW BOTH LOCAL LAW AND SEQUEL INTERACT MATTERS BECAUSE OF OPPOSED pNOT APPLY. HOWEVER IT IS LOCAL LAW THAT DETERMINES WHICH PROJECTS ARE AS OF RIGHT AND WHICH ONES ARE DISCRETIONARY AND THESE LOCAL LAWS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. ARE PLANNING COULD HAVE SUMMARIES HELP US UNDERSTAND THESE DISTINCTIONS SO THAT WE CAN CONSTRUCT OUR PROJECT DATABASE. OUR PROJECT DATABASE CONTAINS. ALL PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS THAT RECEIVED A FINAL ENTITLEMENT -- BUILDING PERMIT IN TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN OR TWENTY SIXTEEN TO CONSTRUCT THE DATABASES WE COLLECTED ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS. INCLUDING LOCATION -- INFORMATION ABOUT THE PRIOR USE OF THE PARCEL THE PROPOSED PROJECT DETAILS ENTITLEMENT SEE CA ANDY'S OF APPROVALS. FOR A THIRD PHASE WE CONDUCTED RESEARCH INTERVIEWS WITH MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. CITY STAFF LIKE PLANNERS AN ATTORNEY'S MARKET RATE AND NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS ADVOCATES AND CONSULTANTS TYPICALLY OUTSIDE COUNSEL ARCHITECTS ARE ENTITLEMENT EXPERTS. AND THEN FR A FINAL PHASE WE EXAMINE WHETHER THE PROJECTS WE STUDIED WENT THROUGH LOCAL LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND LITIGATION AND PARTICULARLY SEQUEL RELATED LITIGATION. TURNING OUT BRIEFLY I'M TO SOME IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT DATA ACCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. UNSURPRISINGLY OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS DATA TO CONSTRUCT THE DATABASE VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. IN ORDER TO CREATE A PROJECT DATABASE WE FIRST OBTAIN A LIST OF ENTITLED DEVELOPMENTS THAT MEET OUR CRITERIA. AND VERY FEW CITIES HAD A LIST OF ENTITLEMENT ABOUT ENTITLED DEVELOPMENTS READILY AVAILABLE ON THE PLANNING WEBSITES. SO THAT MEANS THAT IN MOST JURISDICTIONS WE HAD TO CALL THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO REQUEST THIS LAST OR SUBMIT A PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST. AND I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT DURING THESE YEARS STATE MANDATED REPORTING THROUGH THE HOUSING ELEMENT DID NOT REALLY HELP US TO UNDERSTAND ENTITLEMENT PROCESSES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. DURING OUR STUDY YEARS THE HOUSING ELEMENT ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS TRACK PERMITTED PROJECTS ON A YEARLY BASIS BUT THEY DO NOT CONTAIN DATA ON THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS SEES THAT PRECEDE THESE BUILDING PERMITS. AND THEN AFTER OBTAINING THE PROJECT LIST WE GATHER DATA ON THE MOVE ON THE PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS. AND THIS IS REALLY WHERE THE PROJECT LAW THAT'S THE LOCAL CITY LEVEL VERY MOST SIGNIFICANTLY. A MINORITY OF LARGE CITIES HAVE LINKS THEY'RE ENTITLEMENT DATA TO ZONING AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THIS LINKAGE MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO COLLECT ALL PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS AT ONE TIME. MOST JURISDICTIONS HAVE SOME SORT OF PERMITTING INTERFACE AVAILABLE WHICH AT THE MINIMUM MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO SEARCH BY APPLICATION NUMBER TO DETERMINE ENTITLEMENT OUTCOMES. BUT EVEN THE CITY IS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW PERMITTING INTERFACES LIKE EXCEL -- OR OTHER CLOUD BASED SOFTWARE MISSING OR INCOMPLETE INFORMATION IS COMMON. SOME JURISDICTIONS AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR SMALLER CITIES HAVE NO ONLINE ENTITLEMENT ARE PERMITTING INTERFACE WHICH THEN REQUIRES OUR TEAM TO SEARCH THROUGH EVERY SINGLE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL AGENDA TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS ENTITLED IN THAT CITY. AND THE QUALITY OF THESE AGENDAS AND MINUTES VERY CONSIDERABLY. NOT ALL CITIES MAKE STAFF REPORTS AVAILABLE WITH THEIR AGENDAS ON THEIR PUBLIC WEBSITES WHICH THEN REQUIRES US TO CONDUCT ANOTHER LAYER OF REQUESTS FOR DATA. AND DURING THIS PROCESS WE ALSO OBSERVE MAJOR INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN AGENDAS AND STAFF REPORTS AND IT'S CRITICAL pDATA DIRECTLY IMPACTS THE RELIABILITY OF SELF REPORTED DATA FROM THE CITIES. AND HAS IMPORTANT IMPACTS ON THE APPROVAL PROCESS MORE GENERALLY. WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE DESPITE THEIR HEAVY WORKLOADS. ALL OF THE PLANNING DEPARTMENTS WE ENGAGE WITH WERE VERY RESPONSIVE AND VERY ACCOMMODATING OF OUR REQUESTS. FROM OUR WORK IN INTERVIEWS IT REALLY APPEARS THAT TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS INFLUENCE HOW QUICKLY STAFF AND OUTSIDE RESEARCHERS CAN ANALYZE THESE LOCAL PROCESS SEES. AND THEN FINALLY TOUCHING BRIEFLY ON OUR LITIGATED RICARDO LITIGATION RELATED RESEARCH -- WE ALSO PROVIDED A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF ALL LITIGATION AGAINST ENTITLED DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS. TO DO THIS RESEARCH STATE RECORDS TO IDENTIFY ALL SEEK OF PETITIONS AND OUR BAY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CITIES. WE ALSO SEARCHED COUNTY COURT RECORDS WHICH ENABLED US TO IDENTIFY ALL WRITS FILED AGAINST EACH OVER SELECTED CITIES BETWEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO PROVIDE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ABOUT RATES OF LITIGATION FOR C. CA AND NON SEQUEL CLAIMS. WE ISOLATED RECORDS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATED PROJECTS OF FIVE OR MORE RESIDENTIAL UNITS. WE COMPLETED THIS COMPARISON FOR THE BAY AREA AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF COMPLETING THE COLLECTION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THEN FINALLY TO OBTAIN APPEAL RATES WE SEARCHED ALL ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL AGENDA AND MINUTES FROM. TWENTY FOURTEEN TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND NOW WE'LL TURN TO OUR FINDINGS TO RESEARCH HAS UNCOVERED. SO I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH FINDINGS ABOUT THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS IS GENERALLY AND THEN I WILL PROVIDE SPECIFIC FINDINGS RELATED TO THE APPLICATION OF SYKORA WITHIN OUR STUDY CITIES. OUR FIRST NOTABLE FINDING WAS THAT OUR NINE STUDY CITIES REQUIRED DISCRETIONARY REVIEW FOR NEARLY ALL OF THE ONE THOUSAND AND EIGHTY SEVEN PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN OUR DATA SET. SO AFTER EXAMINING EACH CITIES LAND YOU SYSTEM THAT WE FOUND THAT ONLY LOS ANGELES. HAD AN AS OF RIGHT PROCESS THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLES TO PROPOSE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS. SPECIFICALLY LOS ANGELES HASN'T AS OF RIGHT PROCESS FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF UP TO FORTY NINE UNITS. IF THE UNDERLYING ZONING PERMITS THE DENSITY ONCE WE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED DATA AT THE PROJECT LEVEL HOWEVER WE FOUND THAT ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY PROJECTS OR ABOUT 25%. OF THE PROJECTS WE ANALYZE WITHIN LOS ANGELES WHERE AS OF RIGHT. WE ALSO FOUND THAT EIGHT OF THE OTHER NINE CITIES THAT WE STUDIED DO NOT PROVIDE FOR AS OF RIGHT TO PROCESSES FOR PROJECTS OF FIVE OR MORE UNITS. AND IN FACT WITHIN TWO OF OUR STUDY CITIES THERE IS NO AS OF RIGHT PROCESS FOR ANY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT INCLUDES SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS. WE USE FIGURE THREE IN OUR HAND OUT TO YOU TO ILLUSTRATE THIS. THIS FINDING IS OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE FOR OUR WORK BECAUSE AS PREVIOUSLY EXPLAINED. THE WHAT DOES NOT APPLY TO AS OF RIGHT PROJECTS BUT IT DOES APPLY TO PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. SO WHEN CITIES CHOOSE TO REQUIRED FIGURE SEEK WHAT. AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THIS FINDING MEANS IS THAT NINE OF OUR NINE CITIES ARE CHOOSING TO REQUIRE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROCESS TO APPLY TO DO PRETTY MUCH ALL RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT. AND THEREFORE THE CITIES ARE. REQUIRING THAT THESE PROJECTS UNDERGO ENVIRONMENTS REVIEW UNDERSUPPLY. AND THIS INCLUDES PROJECTS THAT COMPLETELY COMPLY WITH THE LOCAL ZONING CODE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT FINDING IS THAT THE LOCAL PROCESSES FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW VERY TREMENDOUSLY ACROSS HOW THEY WERE APPLIED IN OUR NINE CITIES. EVEN WHEN THE CITIES WERE USING THE SAME MECHANISM FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW -- TABLE ONE IN OUR HAND OUT ILLUSTRATES THE DIFFERENCE IS IN THE ENTITLEMENT TIME FRAMES ACROSS OUR NINE CITIES. THOSE TIME FRAMES RANGE FROM SEVEN TO THIRTY NINE MONTHS IN THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO MOVE THROUGH THE REQUIRED ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. WE WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AFTER THE CLOSE ANALYSIS OF THESE TIME FRAMES AND THE APPROVAL PROCESS IS THAT THESE PROPOSED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS MOVED THROUGH. WE FEAR FOUNDED THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF APPROVALS THE CITY IMPOSES. AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES FOR A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TO MOVE THROUGH THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS. OAKLAND IN REDWOOD CITY FOR EXAMPLE ARE TO THE CITIES THAT IMPOSE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF APPROVAL STEPS ON AVERAGE. BUT THEMEDIAN TIME LINES IN THOSE CITIES WERE SEVEN MONTHS IN CONTRAST SANTA MONICA IMPOSES LESS STEPS TO APPROVAL BUT THE MEDIAN TIMELINE TO ENTITLEMENT IS THIRTY NINE MONTHS. THEY'RE ALSO DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A REALLY IT IMPOSES TO SECURE ENTITLEMENT AND RATES OF ENTITLEMENT TABLE ONE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THIS. WHEN ALSO IDENTIFIES THE PRIMARY MECHANISM THAT DISCRETIONARY REVIEW TAKES IN EACH CITY? SO YOU'LL KNOW IN THAT TABLE THAT FIVE OF THE CITIES THAT ARE LISTED ARE USING DESIGNER ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW IS OUR PRIMARY MECHANISM. FOR DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. AND YET [inaudible] DOT. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE USING THE SAME PROCESS. TO EACH OF THESE POINTS ARE HIGHLIGHTING HOW LOCAL CONTEXT ARE SHAPING THE APPLICATION OF LAW. OUR INTERVIEW DATA SUGGESTS THAT OF OUR VARIETY OF NON LAW FACTORS. SUCH AS CITY STAFFING OR POLITICS ARE INFLUENCING HOW SIMILAR LAWS ARE APPLIED WITHIN VARIOUS LOCAL CONTACTS. ANOTHER NOTABLE OBSERVATION IS THAT ENTITLEMENT TIME LINES DO NOTALWAYS APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PROJECT SPECIFICALLY PROJECTS SIZE. THE FOR EXAMPLE SMALLER PROJECTS DEFINED AS FIVE OR TWO TWENTY FIVE UNITS IN THIS CONTEXT. MOVE FASTER THROUGH ENTITLEMENT PROCESSES IN ONLY TWO OF OUR NINE STUDY CITIES. SO IN SIX CITIES WE ALSO SAW THAT SMALLER PROJECTS TO NOTABLY LONGER THAN LARGER PROJECTS. MULTIPLE INTERVIEWEES OFFERED ONE EXPLANATION FOR THIS SUGGESTING THAT LARGER PROJECTS ARE SOMETIMES RESOURCE IN A WAY THAT SOME SMALLER PROJECTS OR NOT. AND THAT THIS ALLOWS LARGER PROJECTS TO BENEFIT FROM CONSULTANT SECOND HELP. DEVELOPERS NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITY OTHER EXPLANATION MAY BE RELATED TO WHERE THE PROJECTS ARE CITED. AS WE OBSERVE THAT SOME PROJECTS INCLUDING LARGER PROJECTS. THAT ARE PROPOSED WITHIN SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS IN THE CITY'S APPEAR TO MOVE FASTER THAN THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE PROPOSED OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS. OUR FINDINGS ARE ALSO SHOWING WHERE HOW WHERE AND HOW PROJECTS ARE COMPLYING SEEK REQUIREMENTS AND THESE ARE IMPORTANT. WHEN WE ANALYZED HOW MANY PROJECTS MOVE THROUGH DIFFERENT DISCRETE PROCESSES TO COMPLY WITH SEEK WHAT? WE FOUND THAT A LOW PERCENTAGE OF THE PROJECTS WE STUDIED REQUIRED FULL THE I. OURS THIS IS NOTABLE TO US BECAUSE IN INTERVIEWS WE FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED PERCEPTIONS THAT HE AYE OURS WERE COMMON. AND CERTAINLY PERCEPTIONS THAT THEY WERE MORE COMMON THAN WHAT WE OBSERVE IN THE PROJECT LEVEL DATA. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT REQUIRE ER'S SUPPLIED ALSO SURPRISED US. SO ALTHOUGH GENERALLY ER'S WERE REQUIRED FOR THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN MOST OF OUR CITIES WE ALSO FOUND THAT RELATIVELY LARGE PROJECTS AND NOW WE'RE DEFINING THAT AS A HUNDRED UNITS ARE MORE. COULD GO THROUGH STREAMLINED SECRET PROCESSES. SO WE OBSERVE THAT IN SOME CITIES A LARGE PROJECT OF OVER A HUNDRED UNITS COULD BENEFIT FROM TEARING. WHILE A SMALLER PROJECT OF LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE UNITS MIGHT HAVE ANY AYE ARE. AND WHEN WE REFER TO STREAMLINE HERE OF COURSE REFERRING TO TEARING OFF OF AN E. I. ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN OR GENERAL PLAN. AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS INDICATED THAT. WHETHER A PROPOSED PROJECT WAS PROPOSED WITHIN A SPECIFIC PLAN AREA RATHER THAN THE PROJECT CHARACTERISTICS. ACTUALLY DETERMINE THIS OUTCOME. SO WE CAN SEE IN THIS KIND OF CONTEXT HOW IMPORTANT. IT IS. THAT PLANNING ACTIVITIES HELP FACILITATE STREAMLINING. WE ALSO FOUND THAT IN GENERAL THE USE OF STREAMLINING APPEARS ASSOCIATED WITH QUICKER TIME LINES OVERALL AND LOWER RATES OF LITIGATION. SO CROSS ALL NINE CITIES ON AVERAGE TEARING TAKES SIXTEEN MONTHS THE IRS TAKE FORTY FOUR MONTHS. BUT OCCASION RATES ARE PROJECTS THAT USED HEARING WERE AS LOW AS EDUCATION RATES OF PROJECTS THAT USE ER'S WERE 19%. THE COLLECTIVELY AGAIN THIS SHOWS SELECT IT STREAMLINING FOR MORE DENSE INFILL DEVELOPMENT. WITH RESPECT TO SEE WILL LITIGATION OVERALL WHEN WE ANALYSE OUR SET OF PROJECTS TO SEE HOW MANY FACE SEQUEL LITIGATION WE FOUND THAT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF ALL OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE STUDIED. FACE LITIGATION THAT INCLUDED STEEPER RELATED CLAIMS THE TABLE THREE IN THE HANDOUT PROVIDES DETAILS ABOUT LITIGATION RATES WITHIN EACH OF OUR SPECIFIC CITIES. AND INTERESTINGLY ALTHOUGH SOME CITIES AT VERY LOW SEQUEL LITIGATION RATES WE OFTEN HEARD STATEMENTS IN INTERVIEWS WITH IN ALL CITIES THAT REVEAL PERCEPTIONS THAT SEQUEL LITIGATION WAS MUCH HIGHER AND THAT LITIGATION SHAPE LOCAL PRACTICES. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OPPOSITION PROPOSED. RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FACE WE ALSO EXPLORED RATES OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS AND WHICH OPPONENTS CAN CHALLENGE LOCAL DECISIONS MADE USING DISCRETIONARY REVIEW PROCESS WE PRESENT THE RATES OF ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS ALSO IN TABLE. THREE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FINDING IS THAT ACROSS ALL CITIES RATES IN THE MINISTRY OF APPEALS AND LITIGATION DO NOT NECESSARILY SEEM TO HAVE AN OBVIOUS RELATIONSHIP TO ENTITLEMENT HIGHLIGHTS GENERALLY. AFTER ANALYZING THE LAWSUITS THAT DID ARISE IN OUR DATA WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE WHAT IS OCCURRING ACROSS ALL SEQUEL COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS. SO TABLE FOR PROVIDE YOU SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOTAL OF THE THIRTY LAWSUITS THAT WE LOOKED AT IN THE ALL NINE CITIES. IT PROVIDES YOU THE DISTRIBUTION OF LITIGATION ACROSTIC BUT PATHWAYS FOR THESE LAWSUITS. THIS TELLS US HOW MANY OF THE LAWSUIT'S FELL WITHIN SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OF SEQUEL COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS. THIS TABLE DOES NOT PROVIDE THE FREQUENCY OF LITIGATION BY SECRET COMPLIANCE PATHWAYS OR IN OTHER WORDS THIS TABLE DOES NOT TELL YOU HOW LIKELY A PROJECT IS TO FACE LITIGATION BASED ON THE SEQUEL COMPLIANCE PATHWAY USE. BUT WE DID DO THAT CALCULATION AND FOUND THAT ACROSS ALL CITIES CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT PROJECTS AND DOES IT USED HEARING ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE LITIGATED. AND HE AYE OURS ARE THE MOST LITIGATED WITHIN LOS ANGELES PROJECTS WITH MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATIONS APPEAR TO BE THE LEAST LIKELY TO BE NOTED LITIGATED ANY AYE OURS ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE LITIGATED. AND SOME OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE RELEVANT SOMETIMES THE DISCONNECT BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS OCCURRING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WHAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE OCCURRING. AND SO NOW WILL MOVE TO SOME OF THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS THANK YOU MARA SO WHEN KEY TAKEAWAYS THE NEED FOR MORE AND BETTER DATA. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW TO FIX OUR LAND USE REGULATION PROCESS. BUT IS NOT READILY AVAILABLE I TOOK AS A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT TO COLLECT FOR THE CITIES. INDEED WE FOUND SUBSTANTIAL DISCREPANCIES BUT THE TAKE BETWEEN THE DATA WE COLLECTED. THE DATA THAT THE CITIES THEMSELVES PROVIDED TO US WE ASK FOR THEIR REPORTS TO COMPARE WITH OUR INFORMATION OR THE DATA THAT CITIES OF SELF REPORTED TO OTHER ACADEMIC SURVEYS. OR INFORMATION REQUESTS FROM THE STATE. THIS WE'VE SEEN THERE'S AT LEAST A COUPLE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THESE DISCREPANCIES IN PART THE COMPLEXITY OF THE LOCAL LAND USE REGULATORY SYSTEMS IN THEIR VARIATION FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. AND ALSO THE RESOURCE LIMITATIONS OF MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE FACT THAT THEY MAY NOT BE PRIORITIZING DATA COLLECTION AVAILABILITY AND ANALYSIS. THE CHALLENGES WITH DATA AVAILABILITY IN ACCESSIBILITY HAVE BROUGHT IMPORTANCE AND NOT JUST FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH PROJECTS LIKE OURS. FOR INSTANCE LACK OF ACCESSIBLE OR AVAILABLE DATA MADE DIRECTLY IMPACT THE ABILITY OF CITY PLANNERS TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEIR PROCESS EASIER FUNCTION OVERALL AND HOW THIS PROCESS EASIER SHAPING PROJECT PROPOSALS AND APPROVALS. WHEN WE FOLLOWED UP ON MISSING DATA MANY JURISDICTIONS NOTED THEY WERE UNABLE TO EXTRACT THAT DATA DUE TO LIMITATIONS IN THEIR UNDERLYING DATA SYSTEMS? OTHER CITIES REMARKED THAT THE LIMITED CAPACITY OF THEIR ONLINE PERMITTING SYSTEMS MAY PROJECT MANAGEMENT MORE DIFFICULT AND CREATED PROCESS INEFFICIENCIES. BUT THESE DATA PROBLEMS ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ACTUALLY MEET THEIR OBJECT ACCURATELY MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER STATE HOUSING ELEMENT LAW. TO REPORT ON THE APPROVAL OF HOUSING PROJECTS STATE. EFFECTIVELY THE STATE HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO ACCURATELY ASSESS HOW THE LAND USE REGULATORY AN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS IS OPERATING CALIFORNIA. EFFECTIVELY OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO HOLD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE REGULATORY PROGRAMS. AND THEY MAY MAKE IT HARDER FOR PROJECT PROPONENTS AND DEVELOPERS TACKLING THOSE WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH A PARTICULAR JURISDICTIONS PROCESS. I UNDERSTAND HOW IT FUNCTIONS AND WHAT THE AND ALSO GOING TO THE QUESTION OF RECORD DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU EXPORT IN THE PRIOR PANEL IT MAY ALSO INTERFERE WITH THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO RAPIDLY AND EFFICIENTLY PRODUCE RECORDS -- UNDERLYING THE CASES THAT THEN GO TO LITIGATION. AS WHERE INDICATED OUR DATA DO NOT AT PRESENT SHOW A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SEQUEL EDUCATION RATES AND TIME FRAMES WERE APPROVALS OR THE RATE AT WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENTITLED UNITS. NOR DO THEY SHOW A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL RATES AND TIME FRAMES ON ASSIGNMENT. FOR INSTANCE IN LONG BEACH LOS ANGELES IN REDWOOD CITY HI OR MODERATELY HIGH LITIGATION RATES ARE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A LONGER APPROVAL TIME FRAMES. COUNTRY TO THE EXPECTATION THAT CIVIL LITIGATION MY TRUCK DRAWN OUT DEFENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW LAND USE APPROVAL PROCESS SEES. HOWEVER WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE STILL COLLECTING DATA ON THESE QUESTIONS WERE COLLECTING MORE DATA ON ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS LITIGATION. MORE DATA ON ADDITIONAL CITIES AROUND THE STATE AND WE EXPECT TO CONDUCT MORE SOPHISTICATED ANALYSES OF THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN LITIGATION THE AMOUNT OF DISCRETION APPROVALS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS. TIME FRAMES AND ENTITLEMENT RATES IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT ADDITIONAL DATA ANALYSIS WILL FIND RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE CANNOT CURRENTLY TO TAX. ALONG THOSE LINES I WOULD ALSO FLAG THAT ONE SHOULD NOT READ TOO MUCH INTO LOW LITIGATION APPEAL RATES IN CITIES THAT THEMSELVES APPROVED VERY FEW PROJECTS TO BEGIN WITH. SUCH AS POLITICS IN THE CITY'S THE LOW LITIGATION RATES MASK UNDERLYING POLITICAL AND LEGAL DYNAMICS THAT DETER ANY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER PROJECT APPROVED. COMBINING A QUANTITATIVE DATA WITH AND INTERVIEW RESULTS OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FOCUS OF REFORM EFFORTS. SHOULD BE ON THE LOCAL LAND USE REGULATORY SYSTEM AND THE UNDERLYING POLITICAL IN FISCAL DRIVERS OF THAT SYSTEM. BUT ANY REFORM EFFORTS MUST ALSO BE CAREFUL DOUBLE COMMUNITIES AND ONLY RECENTLY HAVE BECOME EMPOWERED ENOUGH TO HAVE A VOICE IN THAT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. ANOTHER THING THAT A RESULT SHOWS THAT STREAMLINING VERTICALLY THROUGH THE USE OF TEARING OFF A PRIOR GENERAL AND IS AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO FACILITATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING IMPORTANT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ELEMENTS. IN FACT AS WHERE INDICATED WITH ON THE PROJECTS THAT WENT THROUGH TEARING RELATED EXCEPTIONS IT'S GLOBAL AND WERE LITIGATED A LOWER RATES. SO THAT'S OUR BASIC SUMMARY AND WE LOOK FOR TO QUESTIONS WERE HAPPY TO EXPLORE ANY ASPECTS. OF THE PROJECT THAT PEOPLE WANT A I'VE BEEN IN MORE DEEPLY ON THANK YOU THANK YOU OFFER YOUR RESEARCH AND VERY INTERESTING -- LET ME JUST ASK YOU ONE ISSUE REALLY AND ALL THIS -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. THE FACT THAT IT'S MORE OF THE PLANNING PROCESS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. HE WAS STILL VERY MUCH PART OF THAT. ENVIRONMENT RIGHT IN AND AND I GUESS IS IT IS REALLY HARD TO GET IT'S BEEN ASKED A COUPLE TIMES BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO GET ANY KIND OF DATA ABOUT. WHAT SORT OF -- IMPACT THE THREAT OF A POTENTIAL LAWSUIT OR OR JUST THE THE USE OF EQUAL AS A TOOL. MIGHT HAVE ON THE PROCESS AND AND DID YOU GET ANY AT LEAST ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE ABOUT THAT OR WAS IT JUST IT'S IT'S JUST SO DIFFICULT IF YOU ASK ABOUT THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR THE PROJECT PROCESS BOTH ACTUALLY. SO I THINK ON THE PROJECT PROCESS RIGHT THE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IS LOOKING AT LITIGATION AN APPEAL RATES ACROSS JURISDICTIONS AND SING OF THAT RELATES AT ALL. THE TIME FRAMES FOR APPROVAL OR ENTITLEMENT RATES IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS AND WE DON'T SEE A CLEAR RELATIONSHIP AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT ISN'T RELEVENT BUT IT IS NOT A VERY STE IT'S NOT A STRONG A FACTOR THAT IS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS IN TERMS OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AT THE PLANNING STAGE THAT IS A DIFFICULT DIFFERENT AN IMPORTANT QUESTION. AND WE HAVE BEEN COLLECTED THE DATA AT THE PLANNING STAGE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT KIND OF PROCESS THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE USING EDUCATION RATES AROUND THAT THAT WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT INTERESTING RESEARCH QUESTION? AND YOU KNOW THE LIMITATIONS WE HAVE IN TERMS OF RESEARCHERS IN TERMS OF GETTING FUNDING AND CAPACITY TO RESEARCH SORT OF HAVE CONSTRAIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO COLLECT. OKAYI MEANT YOU HEARD THE DISCUSSION EARLIER ABOUT STANDING AND WHO DO YOU HAVE ANY. YOU'RE ALL SMART LAWYERS DO YOU HAVE ANY. THOUGHTS ABOUT. THE ABUSE OR AN ASSET THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE USE OF OF OF STANDING IN THIS SPACE -- MANY ANY ANY COMMENTS ON THAT I HAVE A BLOG POST ON THAT THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO PASS ON IF YOU'D LIKE WHERE I WROTE A COMPARISON OF NEED BUT FEDERAL STANDING LEAD -- JURISPRUDENCE IN SEQUENCE STANDING JURISPRUDENCE. I AND HOW IT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STANDARDS AND WHAT DIFFERENCES THAT MIGHT LEAD INTO OUTCOMES THAT. THAT'S A FEW YEARS OLD AT THIS POINT SO YOU KNOW. ONE AND THAT'S RELYING SOLELY ON PUBLISHED OPINIONS WERE DOING AN ANALYSIS OF HOW COURTS ARE APPLYING THE STANDARDS. THAT IS THE QUESTION. AS WE DO OUR LITIGATION ANALYSIS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET A LITTLE MORE INSIGHT TO LOOK AT FOR INSTANCE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY OF THE LAWSUITS WE LOOKED AT WERE DISMISSED ON STANDING GROUNDS -- DAD'S DATA WERE STILL TRYING TO COLLECT. AT THE LITIGATION LEVEL ONE OF THE OBSTACLES. DIFFICULT AND TO BE FRANK EXPENSIVE TO ACCESS TO THE ONLINE CORD PORTALS. WHAT WAS I SEE SAID TO THE ONLINE COURT SYSTEMS HA HA OR SOME OF THE DATA IS NOT EVEN ON THE ONLINE SYSTEMS RIGHT? OKAY QUESTION SEVEN YES -- YES I I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALL LAWYERS WE LIKE TO GET. CAUGHT UP IN THE THE ALSO ULTIMATE -- LAWSUIT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE FINDINGS THAT YOU MADE ON THIS SORT OF BYZANTINE. LOCAL ORDINANCE. ZONING LAW -- SITUATION THAT SITS UP THERE IN ALL FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO CITIES -- BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES YOU KNOW AGAIN THE RAP IS THAT SEEKS WAS WHAT TRIPS SET UP. RIGHT EVERYBODY LIKES TO SAY THAT AND YOU HAVE A STREAMLINED -- SEEK WHAT I'M IN I DON'T KILL THE PROJECT FOR WHATEVER REASON. RIGHT IN SICK WITH GETS THE HOOK BECAUSE WE HAD TO GO THE SEQUEL AND THAT AND THAT REQUIRED THIS LENGTHY DISCUSSION. ON ON THINGS. SO I I WANT TO SAY THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE WE'VE FOCUSED ON THAT CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME. OF THOSE NINE CITIES THERE SOME OF THESE -- CONFUSING SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE AND I LIVE IN FREMONT SO I'M SORT OF FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THESE. SOME OF THE CITIES AROUND ME THAT MAKE THE PROCESS. NOT THE IT'S NOT THAT THE THE DISCUSSION WE HAVE BUT JUST JUST TRYING. TO LOCAL REGULATIONS THAT THEY DO THAT MAKES IT. NOW FOR IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVEN AN ENTITLED. PIECE OF LAND TO GET SOMETHING THE BALLOT -- DEFERRED AT JULIE I THINK CAN REALLY GIVE GOOD EXAMPLES ON YEAH -- I MEAN THERE'S A LOT OF I I THINK WHAT'S YOU KNOW WE WE TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF PLANNING AND SPECIFIC PLANNING PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW TEARING AND AND THE TIME SAVING YOU KNOW BENEFIT OF THAT -- WHAT'S HAPPENED IS A LOT OF CITIES HAVE INTRODUCED -- KIND OF NEW LAYERS OF APPROVAL THREE SPECIFIC PLANNING SO. THEY'VE INTRODUCED APPROVALS RELATED TO SPUR -- REDWOOD CITY IS AN EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO LA -- WHERE IF YOU'RE DEVELOPING WITHIN THE SPECIFIC PLAN AREAS YOU CAN BENEFI FROM STREAMLINING BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF APPROVAL THAT YOU MIGHT NEED TO GET THAT YOU WOULDN'T NEED TO GET IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE A SPECIFIC PLAN AREA? THAT'S ONE IMPORTANT ASPECT -- LIKE AN ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD OR HISTORICAL SO. IT REALLY VARIES -- SO YOU KNOW TYPICALLY THAT KIND OF APPROVAL IS -- IN LA IT'S MORE ASCETIC ORIENTED IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S OR SIMILAR FINDINGS THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE FOR C. U. P.. SO EVEN THAT KIND OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW VERY SUBSTANTIALLY -- ANOTHER COMMON THING WE'RE SEEING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING IS. DEVELOP BAD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO BAKE IN LIKE CERTAIN POLICY OBJECTIVES INTO THEIR ZONING CODE -- SO YOU KNOW OAKLAND FOR EXAMPLE -- INSTEAD OF JUST REDUCING MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. CREATED THE C. U. P. PROCESS WHERE YOU CAN GET LOWERED PARKING BUT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS UP PROCESS YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE YOUR MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS RIGHT. THAT JUST KIND OF ADDS ANOTHER LAYER I'M SANTA MONICA IS ANOTHER REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE. NOT ANYMORE BUT YOU KNOW DURING OUR STUDY YEARS THEY HAD THIS VERY COMPLICATED. DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT PROJECTS ARE DELIVERING CERTAIN TYPES OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THAT REALLY YOU KNOW YOU KNOW PRO LONG TO DEVELOPMENT PROCESS SEES AND REQUIRED A LOT MORE INPUT FROM CITY COUNCIL THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE REQUIRED GIVE ME SOME IDEA BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLANS ARE JUST THE BUZZ WORD IN THE IN THE PLANNING -- ARENA AND NOW WHERE PEOPLE GO I'VE AT LEAST I'VE HEARD. YEARS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE THE THE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO YOU GOT FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT GROUPS AT ONE FIVE THOUSAND DIFFERENT THINGS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU. A PIECE MAJORITY THE CITY COUNCIL. YEAH IT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION I THINK CITIES ARE KIND OF ATTACKING IT FROM TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES YOU CAN HAVE A CITY LIKE SAN FRANCISCO -- THAT CEATES BRIGHT LINE RULES LIKE YOUR PROJECT WILL PAY THIS IMPACT FEE IT WILL HAVE THIS PERCENTAGE AFFORDABLE. YOU KNOW IT WILL PROVIDE THIS AMOUNT OF OPEN SPACE SANTA MONICA DID A REALLY INTERESTING THING WHERE YOU KNOW THEY KIND OF RECOGNIZED. WE MIGHT WANT TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE THESE BENEFITS FROM THE DEVELOPER ON A ONE OFF BASIS RIGHT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS -- WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ACTUALLY MIGHT BE MORE BENEFICIAL FOR DEVELOPERS SINCE THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY -- AND YOU KNOW THAT PROCESS REALLY CREATED TIME INEFFICIENCIES -- AND A LOT OF WORK. BUT IT KIND OF SHOWS THAT YOU KNOW CITIES ARE TRYING TO SORT OF TAKE THESE TWO APPROACHES AND THERE'S PROS AND CONS TO EACH -- IN TERMS OF PROCESS. ONE THE FINDINGS THAT YOU MAKE IS THAT EVEN IF WE STREAMLINED THE SEQUEL PROCESS WITH THE TWELVE MILLION BEER BILLS WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM TE ASSEMBLY. IN LESS THE LOCALS INVEST IN PLANNING PROCESS IT'S ALL FOR NOT CAN YOU FLESH THAT OUT A LITTLE BIT YEAH AND ACTUALLY I THINK THIS GOES TO I THINK ONE OF THE SUB TEXAS CENTER ALAN'S QUESTION EARLIER. THE PROBLEM FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IS THEY PAY FOR THE SPECIFIC PLANNING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS. BUDGET PROPONENTS PAY FOR PROJECT LEVEL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW NOW SAYS. STILL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS EITHER FINANCIALLY CONSTRAINED OR DOESN'T HAVE THE POLITICAL AND SEND IT TO DO T. OR SIMPLY JUST HAS CAPACITY ISSUES. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO DO THAT UP FRONT INVESTMENT. AND THEY'LL PUSH IT ON TO THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECT PROPONENTS. THAT IN TURN WILL NOT ONLY MEAN IT THE PROPONENTS PAYING THE COST FOR THE PRIME OF YOU BUT ALSO EXTEND THE TIME LINES. AND CREATE HIGHER LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY PROJECT APPROVAL. IF CITIES ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO DO THAT UP CONS IN TERMS OF PROJECT. ACTIVITY SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS OUTDATED GENERAL PLANS ARE HOUSING PLANS -- WE HAVE SOME. COASTAL AREAS WE REPRESENT WE NEED TO HAVE AN UPDATE ON ON ON THOSE THINGS WE'RE HAVING THE PROJECT PROPONENT HAVING TO TRY TO STICK. THEIR RIGHT. TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT INTO A TWENTY YEAR OLD A GENERAL PLAN. AND IT'S WITH THE PROBLEM. YEAH I MEAN THAT IS. YEAH THAT IS PART OF THE DYNAMIC THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. UPDATED GENERAL PLANS UPDATED CPAS SPECIFIC PLANS ALL CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO DO TEARING -- AND EVEN IF SOME OF THE EXEMPTIONS AND JULIA CAN TALK ABOUT THIS IN MORE DETAIL EVEN SOME OF THE STATUTORY AND CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS REQUIRED HEARING TO BE FUNCTIONAL. SO THERE IS AN OVERLAP BETWEEN THOSE AS WELL. IN CHAIR SOMEONE. WE'VE IT SEEMS SEND BUT I'M PROBABLY WRONG ON THIS THAT THAT WE DO VARIOUS CATEGORY COLLECTS EMPTIONS SINCE SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS AND IN CITIES SOMEHOW DON'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT THEY DON'T THEY DON'T. THEY DON'T WE WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE DO THIS BECAUSE THIS CRISIS COMING OUT. TO UP THE PROCESS I DON'T SOMETIMES A READING YOUR REPORTS SOMETIMES I THINK MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PROCESS SPEED UP. OR IS THERE SOME MISUNDERSTANDING WHAT'S AVAILABLE OUT THERE. FOR WHAT'S THE RUB I'M AYE. DO YOU WANT TO BUT I WAS JUST GOING TO NOTE THAT IT MAY NOT BE THAT THAT'S TRUE FOR CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS GENERALLY BUT THAT THERE IS MORE USE OF CERTAIN KINDS OF CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS AS COMPARED TO OTHERS. THEY THINK THIS HIGHLIGHTS WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL AS WELL BUT FOR EXAMPLE. BREAKING OUT WHAT WE HAVE I MEAN YOU HAVE. FOR URBAN INFILL PROJECTS S. HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO OF THE PROJECTS WE LOOKED A FIT INTO THAT CATEGORY OF CHEMICAL EXTENSIONS AND THEN IN THE OTHERS IT WAS. ONE TO THREE YOU CAN SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE AND WHICH ONES ARE BEING USED. TO THAT MAY SPEAK MORE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CATALOG EXEMPTION RATHER THAN WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE WILLING TO USE THEM. AND I THINK ANOTHER FACTOR IS THE UNDERLYING POLITICS OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT I MEAN THE IMPLICATION OF DISCRETIONARY REVIEW. IS THAT OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES WANT APPROVE OF DOES NOT WANT TO APPROVE A PROJECT IT DOESN'T HAVE. TO AND DISCRETIONARY REVIEW GETS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT VETO POWER OVER WHETHER PROJECTS PROCEED. AND THAT IS WELL YOU CAN OBSERVE IT IN OUR DATA AND I WOULD BE SHOCKED. IF THIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN MOST CITIES AROUND THE STATE SO I'D LIKE TO ASK ONE QUESTION THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN IT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. YOU'D MENTIONED EARLIER THE NEED TO COLLECT MORE DATA -- I THINK WE'RE ALL SORT OF OPERATING A LITTLE BIT IN THE BLIND I THINK WERE OPERATING FROM OLD INFORMATION POTENTIALLY FROM THE MYTHOLOGY AND THE ILLUSION OF WHO THE BAD GUY IS IF THERE IS A BAD CAR CERTAINLY WHO THE IT WHAT THE IMPEDIMENTS ARE. IF YOU WERE TO CRAFT SOME LEGISLATION IF WE WERE TO CRAFT SOME LEGISLATION TO ASSIST IN. OBTAINING THAT ADDITIONAL DATA THAT AS FIGURE OUT JUST WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE WHAT THEY ARE AND THEN HOW TO FIX THEM. WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WOULD YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED IN THAT LEGISLATION? I'M GOING TO DEFER TO JULIA BECAUSE SHE WAS THE LEAD ON DATA COLLECTION SHERRY [inaudible] WELL. I'M SO. THERE IS NO THERE IS RECENT LEGISLATION AROUND -- INCREASED REPORTING REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH I THINK IS A REALLY GOOD FIRST STEP. I THINK THE ISSUE IS AND WHEN YOU TALK TO PLANNERS -- IS THAT THEIR ABILITY TO TRACK DATA INTERNALLY IS VERY LIMITED IN ITS VERY CONSTRAINED BY THE EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE -- AND YOU KNOW AS WE MENTIONED IN OUR TAKE AWAYS. IT ALSO REALLY IMPACTS HOW THEY MANAGE PROJECTS -- SO I THINK ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN A PARTICULARLY SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT DON'T. HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF MANAGE THESE LARGER SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT THESE PLATFORMS IT'S THINGS LIKE A REALLY COMMON -- USES EXCEL OF IT'S NOT LIKE UNIFORMLY ADOPTED BUT THE UTILITY OF EXCEL -- LIKE A LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAN ADD DIFFERENT MODULES BUT THAT DEPENDS ON YOUR ABILITY TO MANAGE THOSE MODELS TO PAY FOR THOSE MODELS -- SO A LOT OF SMALLER CITIES YOU KNOW JUST HAVE VERY BASIC. KIND OF ACCESS -- YEAH PERHAPS WHAT WE CAN DO AFTER THIS IS GET INFORMATION BECAUSE I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED AGAIN WE WANT TO FIX THE RIGHT PROBLEM. AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE NEED MORE DATA. AND WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT SO THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL AS WELL AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR WORK. BE VERY HAPPY TO ASSIST WITH THAT [inaudible] SO. WE DON'T THIS. THANK YOU FOLKS VERY MUCH WE'RE NOW GOING TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT. OF WE'VE GOT ABOUT HALF AN HOUR IN IF YOU WOULD STEP FORWARD GIVE US YOUR NAME. YOUR AFFILIATION AND TWO MINUTES PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIRS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS CHELSEA TO I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT SYRUPY. WERE IN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATION AND WHERE PRIMARILY BASED ON WORK WITH COMMUNITIES AND TULARE INCURRING COUNTIES. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OF COLOR THAT WE WORK WITH LIVE IN EXTREMELY POLLUTED NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT ARE FACING MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POLLUTION INCLUDING FROM OIL AND GAS WELLS LARGE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS AND WAREHOUSES. SO I'M HERE TODAY TO HIGHLIGHT THE GENERAL AND FUNDAMENTAL THE CALIFORNIA BAR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT OF ALREADY BURDENED COMMUNITIES. LIKE THOSE IN KERN AND TULARE. TO EACH A COMMUNITIES SEQUENCE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS ARE. THE ONLY MEANS OFTENTIMES TO FIND OUT ABOUT LARGE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE COMING TO THEIR NEIGHBOR. DILUTES THE MICHAEL KNIGHT IN. OR ANY DEVELOPMENT FOR THAT MATTER. SEEK WAS IN BERMAN ANNOUNCES AN INFORMATIONAL REQUIREMENTS ARE OFTEN THE ONLY WAY THAT COMMUNITIES CAN LEARN WHAT ADDITIONAL AND CUMULATIVE IMPACTS A PROJECT MAY BRING. AND HOW THESE ADDITIONAL BURDENS MEAN FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN. ULTIMATELY SEEK WHAT IS OFTEN THE ONLY RECORDS THAN BERMAN JUSTICE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO CHANGE THE PROJECT. SO THAT THEIR CHILDREN CAN BE FREE FROM ASTHMA AND CANCER AND HAVE A BETTER FIGHTING CHANCE IN LIFE [inaudible] IN CONCLUSION. IT'S NOT JUST WORDS ON PAPER OR A CUMBERSOME STATUTE. IT IS AN EFFECTIVE. CIVIL RIGHTS SOLUTION BY AJ COMMUNITIES NEED AND USE IN ORDER TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND PROTECT THEIR RIGHT TO CLEAN AIR WATER AND SOIL. URGE YOU TO UPHOLD THE INTEGRITY OF SEEK WERE AND THE ABILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO CONTINUE FIGHTING FOR THESE BRIGHT AS YOU CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MUCH APPRECIATED GOOD AFTERNOON IN LIBERTY MIGHT LIFT MY COUPLE A BIT. HOW CAN EXACT DIRECTOR OF PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE -- THANKING BENCHER FOR HOLDING THIS YEAR AND IT'S BEEN GREAT. I DEFINITELY THINK THIS WAS MORE EXCITING THAN THE DMV HEARING -- WHO KNOWS? THE AS WE HEARD FROM JUSTICE WILL BE YOU KNOW SEEK WAS THERE A PROCEDURE AND THAT PROCESS IS -- IS CHALLENGED -- AND BECAUSE PCL WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL INITIATORS OF PEACE OFFICE AND BY THE WAY IT WAS APPROXIMATELY FOUR PAGES. OF WHEN IT WAS FIRST DONE SO A MUCH DIFFERENT TODAY. AND SO THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS YOU SEEN AS HERE ALL THE TIME YOUR COMMITTEES DEFENDING SEEK WORK. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE DECIDED IT WAS TIME FOR US TO STEP UP ALONG WITH MANY OF OUR PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE. AND TAKE A LOOK AT SEEK WITH TWO POINT. OH SO I'M GONNA TRUNCATE MIGHT TESTIMONY HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO LET SOME OF THE PEOPLE SPEAK BUT THE PC ALONG WITH MANY PARTNERS AND AND YOU SHOULD PROJECT LAST YEAR TO BEGIN SECRET TWO POINT OH UPDATE TO IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS. THAT HAVE ARISEN WITH IMPLEMENTATION IS THE COURT FROM THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATE AND GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY PERSPECTIVES. AND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SEE QUIRK THAT COULD RESOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS WITHOUT REDUCING THE INFORMATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BENEFITS. WITH A TEAM OF SECRET PETITIONER PRACTITIONERS AND ATTORNEYS FROM ACROSS THE STATE REPRESENTING LEAD AGENCIES DEVELOPERS AND PETITIONERS WE'VE BEEN WORKING THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH TUNE TWENTY NINETEEN TO UPDATE SEEK WORK. WITH THE OBJECTIVE TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE AND PREDICTABLE. WE ARE USING THIS YEAR TO BRING STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER AND CRAFT THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION FOR TWENTY TWENTY THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF SEQUEL. WE ARE DRESSING DOZENS OF TECHNICAL ADMINISTRATIVE PRIORITY AREAS SUCH AS THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD. MANDATORY SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES EXPOSURE TO FUTURE HAZARDS. COMMENT DEADLINES APPROPRIATE BASS LINES GIGI MITIGATION. ANNA RONI'S LAWSUITS WITH ONLY FINANCIAL SETTLEMENTS AND NO ENVIRONMENTAL MITIGATION. BY THE WAY THAT HURTS ALL OF US AND WHAT SEEK WAS MEANT TO DO. WE ARE FORMING A BROAD AND BALANCE STAKEHOLDER GROUP TO ADDRESS THESE PRIORITIES AND PROPOSED FIXES AND WITH YOUR HELP AND STRATEGIC FOCUS WE CAN ADDRESS A LARGE NUMBER OF CHALLENGES SECRET FACES THEY IN THIS UPDATE. THANK OUT WE'RE HOPING TO DO THIS FOR TWENTY TWENTY WE WOULD LOVE YOUR HELP ASSISTANCE. WE'RE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO DO THIS AND WE HAVE A PRIORITY LIST OF ABOUT THIRTY THREE THINGS TO FIX AND SEE WHAT WONDERFUL WITH CLOTHING FOR TO IT THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON TORY BALLOTS GIBBONS FROM SHOE MODELING WEINBERGER. SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ATTORNEYS THAT SHE MAHALI HAVE REPRESENTED PUBLIC AGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS. AND COMMUNITY GROUPS AND CIVIL LITIGATION. THE LAST FORTY YEARS WE'VE WATCHED THE GROUP PLAY A VITAL ROLE THESEENVIRONMENT AND WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH EFFORTS TO BLAME SEEKER FOR CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS. TOO OFTEN REFERRED MISINFORMATION ABOUT SEQUEL LITIGATION IN THE HOUSING CONTEXT. WHETHER BY UTILIZING NON STANDARD DEFINITIONS OF INFILL TO PRODUCE MISLEADING NUMBERS OR BY FOCUSING SOLELY ON ON ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE. OPPONENTS OF CIGARETTE MADE EVERY EFFORT TO MANIPULATE THE FAX MAKES DEEP SEA QUEST KEEP GO. TO AID THE COMMITTEE'S EFFORTS TODAY I'D IKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO A FEW FACTS. FIRST FEW HOUSING PROJECTS UNDERGO FULL ER REVIEW. AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. THE TWO TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ASSOCIATED ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS SURVEY. OF COUNTIES REVEAL BIT BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ONLY 6% OF HOUSING PROJECTS WERE REVIEWED BY ER'S. SECOND HOUSING PROJECTS FACE OTHER NON SECRET BARRIERS AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED EXTENSIVELY TODAY. THOSE THOSE BARRIERS DESERVE FURTHER TENSION WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO FOLLOW UP THERE. AND FINALLY THE ALREADY LOW FREQUENCY OF SECRET LITIGATION HAS NOT INCREASED IN THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS. DESPITE THE STATE'S TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THAT PERIOD. AS WE ALL MAY BE FAMILIAR. FEWER THAN 1% OF ALL SECRET PROJECTS UNDERGOING ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND TWO AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ON AVERAGE FEWER THAN TWO HUNDRED SEAT NEW SECRET CASES HAVE BEEN FILED A YEAR. AS THE BE EIGHTY URBAN ECONOMICS POINTED OUT IN ITS RECENT STUDY. THOUGH THE NUMBER OF LAWSUITS HAS FLUCTUATED SLIGHTLY OVER THE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN NO TREND OF DRAMATIC INCREASES DESPITE POPULATION GROWTH. OF OVER TWELVE POINT 5% IN THAT PERIOD. FOR SOME PERSPECTIVE. ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THREE NEW SECRET PETITIONS WERE FILED IN. TWO THOUSAND TWO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE NEW SECRET PETITIONS WERE FILED IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN SOME THE FAX SIMPLY DON'T SUPPORT THIS MYTH OF SECRET LITIGATION. WE MAKE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ASHLEY WARNER I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY BASED IN FRESNO AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LETTING US SPEAK TODAY AND AND DISCUSSING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. I'M TO DIVIDE A LITTLE CONTEXT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WORKS DIRECTLY WITH RESIDENTS FOR MORE THAN THIRTY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN THE EAST COACHELLA VALLEY. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AMONG THE MOST FOR IT AND IN THE STATE BY MULTIPLE SOURCES OF POLLUTION -- LIKE CHELSEA MISSED TWO I ALSO TRAVEL HERE. TO AND TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH AS A AS A BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS TOOL TO ENSURE THAT THESE COMMUNITIES HAVE A VOICE IN CRITICAL LAND USE DECISIONS THAT IMPACT RESIDENTS. ABILITY TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES AND ENJOY AT A SAFE AIR AND DRINKING WATER QUALITY AND AND AND MANY OTHER AMENITIES AND BASICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED. AND AND THEN CONSIDERING SEEK WHY IN THE CONTEXT ARE EVAN ARM HOUSING CRISIS I'M I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE AND NOTE THAT SEQUENCE CRITICAL TO PROTECTING HOUSING STABILITY IN QUALITY. AND IN EXIST AT EXISTING HOUSING AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHERE NOXIOUS INCLUDING LAND USES ARE OFTEN LOCATED I AM VERY BRIEFLY I'D LIKE TO SHARE ONE EXAMPLE BASED IN FRESNO OF WHY I THINK SEEK WAYS SUCH AN ESSENTIAL TOOL. AND LAST YEAR AT THE CITY OF FRESNO APPROVED A TWO POINT ONE MILLION SQUARE FOOT SERIES OF WAREHOUSES WITH A VERY VERY MINIMAL LEVEL OF REVIEW WITHOUT STUDYING THE WATER SUPPLY IMPACTS ON RESIDENTS AND YOU WERE RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FIND WELLS THAT WERE DRYING. AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE IMPACTS OF THE THOUSANDS OF DIESEL EMISSION TRACKS EVERY DAY ON THE KIDS WITH THAT WOULD GO TO SCHOOL I'M JUST A HALF MILE AWAY IN THE RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STREET I'M I'M IN MANY OTHER IMPACTS WE CAN TALK ABOUT SPECIFICALLY. AND AND REALLY FUNDAMENTALLY WITHOUT GIVING RESIDENTS ANY NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT BEFORE MAKING THAT DECISION AND BECAUSE OF SEEK WHAT RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE. AND AND REQUIRE THE CITY TO LOOK MORE IN DEPTH THOSE ISSUES BEFORE THE PROJECT MOVED FORWARD AND ENSURE THAT REALLY THEY'RE ABLE TO REMAIN IN THEIR HOMES AS A SAFE PLACE FOR THE LONG TERM AND SO THAT'S ALL STOP FOR NOW BUT AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU SIR SIX WITH THIS GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS BRENNAN DAWSON POLICY COUNCIL FOR SIERRA CLUB. GOOD OF THE COUNTRY WHAT MANY WOULD HAVE YOU BELIEVE SECRETS PURPOSES NOT O STOP OR HALL PROJECTS OR DEVELOPMENT. THE REQUIREMENT OF DISCLOSURE MITIGATION SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IS A PROCESS THAT INFORMS COMMUNITIES OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL HARMS. SUCH AS AIR AND WATER POLLUTION WHAT FAR RISK AND SAFETY MEASURES AND CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS AND ALSO ALLOWS FOR GREATER PROTECTION CALIFORNIA'S NOW TO RESOURCES. MOREOVER THE REQUIREMENT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION BEFORE A PROJECT IS APPROVED. ENSURES THAT RESIDENTS IN COMMUNITIES HAVE A CHANCE TO WEIGH IN ON MAJOR IMPACTS IN MAJOR PROJECTS IN THEIR BACKYARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE CALIFORNIA LEAVE CONSERVATION VOTERS I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE COMMUNITY THAT CAME BEFORE ME. WE SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT OF THE CONTINUED NOTION THAT SEEK WHAT IS AN IMPEDIMENT TO DEVELOPMENT. AND WE ARE ACUTELY AWARE AND SENSITIVE TO THE HOUSING NEEDS IN THE STATE. CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING SHOULD BE A RIGHT AFFORDED TO ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT EACH YEAR WE'RE TOLD THE SEQUEL IS THE PROBLEM AND EACH YEAR BILLS ARE INTRODUCED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS AND EACH YEAR WE'RE TOLD THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH. ANY EFFORT TO WE CAN SEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> WON'T CHANGE THE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS IDENTIFIED BY DEVELOPERS NOR WILL THEY CHANGE THE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS THAT WERE HIGHLIGHTED IN TODAY'S PANELS ALL IT WILL DO WILL -- WILL HURT THE COMMUNITIES THAT SEE WHAT PROTECTS AND PROVIDES A VOICE. TO WE REALIZE THAT THOSE OTHER IMPEDIMENTS MAYBE HARDER MORE DIFFICULT TO LEGISLATE BUT WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON ADVANCING POLICY THAT INCREASES HOUSING SUPPLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER I'M I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THIS HEARING AND APPRECIATE THAT ALL THREE OF YOU EXPECT CONSIDERABLE TIME OVER THE YEARS -- AND YOUR STAFF'S WORKING ON SEA QUEST AND I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THIS BUILDING GET IN THEIR TRENCHES AND THE DEBATE IS FRAMED AS SEEK WHAT IS THE CAUSE OF THE HOUSING CRISIS OR THERE'S NO PROBLEM WITH SEQUEL AT ALL. AND THE ANSWER IS IT'S NEITHER OF THE ABOVE YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE EIGHTY P. STUDY AND THEY SAY YOU KNOW SOME DEVELOPERS SAY. SEQUENCES HUGE PROBLEM THEY SAID HOWEVER SEEK WITH SUPPORTERS MAINTAIN THAT IS CRITICAL TO ANALYZE AND MITIGATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON BEHALF OF CD I LET ME SAY ABSOLUTELY THAT IS TRUE AND SEQUEL PLAYS. A CRITICAL ROLE THAT BEING SAID SINGLE LIKE THE TAX CODE RIGHT WE SAT WE WE'VE PUT IT DOWN IF YOU LOOK AT SEE QUITE AS THE LAW IT COMES WITH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF STREAMLINING. FROM ITS INITIAL INCENTIVE IN SENT -- INCEPTION TO THE BILLS THAT WE'VE PASSED OVER THE YEAR BY INGENIOUS ATTORNEYS FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FILE LITIGATIONS FOR REASONS THAT OFTENTIMES HAVE NOTHING TO TO DO WITH THE ENVIRONMENT. AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE ISSUE IS IN THIS BUILDING IT'S NOT ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION I CAN'T RECALL THE LAST TIME I GOT UP BEFORE YOU AND SAID. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS ENVIRONMENTAL BAR IS TOO HIGH BUT WHAT I DO REGULARLY GET UP AND SAY IS WE HAVE A SEAT WHAT LITIGATION ABUSE PROBLEM AND THIS IS BORNE OUT BY THE SEA. QUOTA QUOTE EXEMPTIONSTHAT HAVE COME WHEN PEOPLE POINT TO THE BIGGER MEANNESS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS JUSTICE ROBY ARE OR THE EIGHTY P. REPRESENTATIVE THEY SAID THOSE. ACTUALLY WERE NOT EXEMPTIONS THOSE THOSE PROJECTS HAD TO MEET A HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL BAR AND WE ARE THOSE WHERE THE BILL'S WENT TO WAS GETTING SOME LITIGATION STREAMLINING SO I THINK. PUTTING OUR HEADS TOGETHER AND WORKING ON THIS ON THE STREAMLINING IS WELL WORTH IT AND JUST TO TO CLOSE A COMMENT ON THE STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN PRESENTED -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOTS OF DUELING STUDIES SO I'LL SHARE WITH YOU THAT -- A STUDY IN ENTITLED IN THE NAME OF THE ENVIRONMENT BY THE LAW FIRM HOLLAND AT NIGHT FOUND IN A THREE YEAR -- BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY FIFTEEN IN THE SIX COUNTY HUNDRED NINETY ONE CITIES GAG REGION FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS AND A TWO HUNDRED AT HOMELESS SHELTERS WERE CHALLENGED. AND 70% OF THOSE CHALLENGE WHEN TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT ISSUES THANK YOU SO IT JUST LEAVES US TIME TO DO SOME GOOD WORK TO WOULD YOU JUST ALSO FOR THE RECORD GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION SORRY CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY IS AT STAKE YOU. VERY MUCH IN THE HALL INTO NIGHT STUDY WAS BASED ON A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. OF PROJECTS THE GET LITIGATED SO AGAIN WE'VE GOT TO GET BETTER DATA -- WE TRY TO PRESENT SOME OF IT HERE BUT RATHER THAN HAVE DUELING NUMBERS WE REALLY NEED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND AND CONCERNS. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU I'M AN AFFILIATION FIRST -- ADAM WRIGLEY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANTED TO ECHO CBI IS COMING I THINK. THE ANSWER FOR US IS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE I THINK -- AS CASSIE MENTION WE HAVE BEEN ENTRENCHED IN OUR OWN CAMPS I'VE BEEN EDUCATED MEMBERS ON WHERE THEY NEED TO SORT OF FIND MORE MIDDLE GROUND IN TERMS OF SEQUEL ISN'T THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA. BUT I DO THINK -- AND THIS IS COMING FROM SOMEONE USED TO LITIGATE SEQUEL ON THE PLAINTIFF'S SIDE AND ALSO REPRESENT THE AGENCIES IN ANOTHER CAPACITY. THE THREAT OF SEQUEL LITIGATION IS OFTEN JUST AS MUCH AS OF A PROBLEM AS THE ACTUAL FILING OF THE LITIGATION I THINK WE WE ECHO YOUR POINTS THAT MORE DATA ON A SORT OF THOSE THAT ARE NOT CAPTURED. NECESSARILY IN THE DATA WE HEARD TODAY -- IS IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK DOING STATISTICS -- AND AS I THINK CABALLERO MENTION THIS IS A CAN BE USED -- FOR YOUR NARRATIVE AND SO I AGREE HAVING THIS TODAY THANK YOU SITE I'D LIKE TO SUBMIT THAT THE TEST THAT THE DATA DONE BY A UNIVERSITY IS IMPARTIAL AND THERE'S NO FINANCIAL INTEREST. INVOLVED IN IT BUT AGAIN THERE'S A LOT MORE INFORMATION THAT I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. WHETHER IT'S TO DISCUSS SEEK WHAT WARS. OTHER IMPEDIMENTS WHICH SEEM RATHER CLEAR ARE CAUSING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE OUR LAST PUBLIC. WITNESS NAME AND AFFILIATION IN YOUR TWO MINUTES PLEASE OR LESS IS FINE. TOO I'M SORRY EARNED AND I'M WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- AS BOTH A HOUSING ADVOCATE AND SOMEBODY WHO HAS WORKED WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITY GROUPS NAVIGATING THE SECRET PROCESS IT'S BEEN -- FAIRLY FRUSTRATING TO WATCH SEEK WOULD BE BLAMED FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS AT TIMES. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHILE OFTEN UNDERSTANDABLY THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON LITIGATION AND WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT PROJECTS ARE BEING CHALLENGED IN COURT. I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO KEEP IN MIND THE OTHER 99% OF SECRET PROJECTS -- AND WHAT HAPPENS THROUGHOUT THE SEEKER PROCESS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. PROJECTS AREN'T THE SAME AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE SECRET PROCESS AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE MIDDLE -- IS WHAT'S BEEN CALLED THE HEART OF SEQUEL WHICH IS PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN PUBLIC INFORMATION. AND THE ABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES -- TO TO WEIGH IN ON WHAT THE TRUE IT IS I'VE SEEN COMMUNITY GROUPS PROTECT THEMSELVES BOTH FROM AND THE DISPLACEMENT THING CAM THAT CAN RESULTFROM NOT -- BY WEIGHING IN DURING THE SECRET PROCESS SPEAKING TO DISPLACEMENT PRESSURES AFFORDABILITY ISSUES SPECIFIC PHYSICAL FEATURES ARE PROJECTS -- AND AS A RESULT THOSE PROJECTS HAVE BEEN. IMPROVED THEY'VE HAD MEDICATION MEASURES REQUIRED TO DEAL WITH FORMER INDUSTRIAL CONTAMINATION TO PREVENT -- OIL EXTRACTION AND RESIDENTIAL USES NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER -- AND TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THAT WERE WATCHING OUT FOR THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN THAT WILL BE LIVING IN THESE PROJECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT -- THAT THEIR AIM TO IMPROVE SO THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THAT CONCLUDES THE PUBLIC COMMENT POLL A PORTION OF A COACH HERE -- ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IT CHAIR. THEN ALLEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE WITH JUST TO THINK THAT THANKS GUYS. SENATE JACKSON FOR ORGANIZING THIS REALLY INTERESTING AND I LEARNED A LOT AND LOT MORE WORK TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I'D JUST LIKE TO ADD -- YOU KNOW VERY INTERESTING HEARING HOPEFULLY ILLUMINATED. ALL OF US INSTEAD OF SORT OF A KNEE JERK REACTION THAT THE PROBLEM WITH BUILDING IS C. CA. TEN EASY IN EASY STATEMENT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A WHOLE LOT OF ASUS IN REALITY A LOT OF MYTHOLOGY THERE ARE ISSUES I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PLANNING AND CONSERVATION LEAGUE A PERSPECTIVE COMING. FORWARD THERE CERTAINLY TWEAKS THAT WE CAN TO A TO CONTINUE SOME OF THE WORK WE DID PREVIOUSLY -- WE KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF EXEMPTIONS AND STREAMLINING PROVISIONS THAT HAVE ALSO BEEN CREATED THAT. SEEM TO BE WORKING IN MANY INSTANCES -- DOESN'T APPEAR THAT SEQUENCE. A IS NOT THE THE THE PRIMARY BARRIER TO DEVELOPMENT BUT WE DO WOULD LIKE TO GET MORE DATA. ON THAT. AND CERTAINLY GETTING THAT INFORMATION PERHAPS MOVING THAT FORWARD THIS YEAR MIGHT BE HELPFUL AS WELL -- EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE NUMBER OF INSTANCES WHERE THAT'S OCCURRED IN ALL THE EFFORTS THAT ARE MADE. TO RESOLVE THESE MATTERS THROUGH MANDATORY SETTLEMENT CONFERENCES AND THE PRESSURES WERE YOU FORCED TO PEOPLE OR TWO SIDES. SEVERAL SIDES INTO ROOM TO SETTLE THE MATTER USUALLY WORKS -- AND THAT. TO THAT SHE COULD IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL. OF CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE STATE AND ALSO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUES I TELL PEOPLE THAT I THINK BUT FOR SEQUEL WE COULD VERY WELL LOOK LIKE MIAMI BEACH. AND IF YOU'VE BEEN THERE YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN -- AND CERTAINLY WE PRIDE OURSELVES OR TO US I HOPE WE DO CONSIDERING CHEAP TO LIVE HERE. BUT WE DO HAVE A QUALITY OF LIFE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN. BE INSIGHTFUL AND THOUGHTFUL AND CIRCUMSPECT IN HOW WE GO ABOUT THE FIXING SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE WITHOUT COMPROMISING. WHAT MAKES THIS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY PLACE TO LIVE SO WITH THAT? THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. RICHARD
