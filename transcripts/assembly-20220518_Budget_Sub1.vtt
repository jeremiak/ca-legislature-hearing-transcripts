COMMENTS WILL. COME DOWN TO TWO

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:40.336
MAIN POINTS HOWEVER ONE IS- ARE

SOLVE THAT PROBLEM IN THE NEAR

00:55:43.907 --> 00:55:47.110

THESE PROPOSALS REALLY READY TO

00:55:52.482 --> 00:55:57.220
GO- SO FOR EXAMPLE- THIS

00:55:57.287 --> 00:55:58.488
PROPOSAL DOES NOT HAVE

00:55:58.555 --> 00:56:00.256
ASSOCIATED TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

00:56:00.323 --> 00:56:02.392
SO IT'S HARD TO KNOW EXACTLY HOW

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:03.593
SOME OF THE INITIATIVESWOULD

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.695
WORK- ON BOTH THE TRAINING AND

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:07.597
INTERNSHIP COMPONENTS OF THE

00:56:07.664 --> 00:56:10.233
PROPOSAL WERE NOT- CERTAIN THAT

THESE PROPOSALS WOULD

00:56:11.935 --> 00:56:13.937
NECESSARILY SOLVE- THE

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:15.205
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:16.940

SERVICE PROVIDER- WORK FORCE-

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:23.613
POPULATION. AND THEN ON THE

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.181
PIECE THAT CONCERNS TUITION

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:26.483
REIMBURSEMENT FOR REGIONAL

00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:28.351
CENTER STAFF WE BELIEVE THERE

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:30.653
ARE SOME- KEY DETAILS THAT ARE

00:56:30.720 --> 00:56:32.722
LACKING FROM THE PROPOSAL. SO

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:35.325
FIRST- THE PROPOSAL DOES NOT

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:37.427

00:56:37.494 --> 00:56:39.229
COMMITMENT WOULD BE FOLLOWING

RECEIPT OF THE TUITION

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:43.733
REIMBURSEMENT- IT'S OUR

00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:45.368
UNDERSTANDING THIS HAS NOT BEEN

00:56:45.435 --> 00:56:47.003
DETERMINED YET M. BUT THE

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.072
LEGISLATURE. OBVIOUS INTEREST IN

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.174
MAKING SURE THAT IT GETS- SOME

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:53.977
BENEFIT FROM AN INVESTMENT IN

00:56:54.043 --> 00:56:56.813
INDIVIDUALS EDUCATION- SECONDS

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.382
WE'RE NOT SURE IF THIS WILL BE

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:00.517
SORT OF AN IMPLEMENTATION

00:57:00.583 --> 00:57:01.785
CHALLENGE OR NOT BUT DDS

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.887
INDICATED TO OUR OFFICE THAT

00:57:03.953 --> 00:57:05.455
BECAUSE- HALF ABOUT HALF OF THE

00:57:05.522 --> 00:57:07.590
REGIONAL CENTERS ARE UNIONIZED.

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.926
WHETHER THAT COULD- HAVE TO HAVE

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:11.227
SOME KIND OF INTERACTION WITH

00:57:11.294 --> 00:57:12.862
THIS PARTICULAR PUZZLE TO

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:15.265
REIMBURSE SOME PEOPLE'S TUITION-

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:17.567
THAT'S JUST AN ISSUE WE HAVEN'T

00:57:17.634 --> 00:57:18.902
GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF YET-

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:21.070
THIRD IT'S SORT OF CLEAR WHICH

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:22.672
REGIONAL STAFF WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:23.506
WHO WOULD MAKE THIS

00:57:23.573 --> 00:57:25.141
DETERMINATION AND WHAT CRITERIA

00:57:25.208 --> 00:57:26.943
THAT WOULD BE BASED ON. AND THEN

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.179
LASTLY- THERE ARE SOME OTHER

00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:30.613
JUST SMALL DETAILS THAT COULD

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.515
HAVE IMPLICATIONS AND NEED TO BE

00:57:32.582 --> 00:57:34.184
IRONED OUT SO JUST FOR EXAMPLE

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.553
IN THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE- IT

00:57:36.619 --> 00:57:39.389
SPECIFIES THAT- THIS WOULD HELP

00:57:39.455 --> 00:57:42.592
PAY FOR REGIONAL CENTER. STAFF

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.127
TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES BUT

00:57:44.194 --> 00:57:45.461
IT DOESN'T DEFINE WHAT AN

00:57:45.528 --> 00:57:47.197
ADVANCE ADVANCED DEGREE IS IT'S

00:57:47.263 --> 00:57:49.732
OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT TYPICALLY

00:57:49.799 --> 00:57:50.800
REFERS TO SERVE. POSTGRADUATE

AND GRADUATE- DEGREES BUT I

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:55.738
THINK- DDS WOULD LIKE THAT TO

ALSO APPLY TO UNDERGRADUATE

00:57:56.472 --> 00:57:59.475
DEGREE SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

00:57:59.542 --> 00:58:00.977
DETAILS THAT STILL NEED TO BE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:02.345

TO BEGIN. I'M I'M GOING TO KEEP

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.765
IT WITH THE CONTINUUM OF CARE

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.334
REFORM IF I CAN AND REALLY

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.902
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THE FAMILY

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.371
FINDING SUPPORT AND THE

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.873
ENGAGEMENT. GRANT DID PRIOR

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.643
APPROPRIATIONS FOR FAVORS

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:24.813
INCLUDING A COUNTY MATCH. ISN'T

01:21:24.879 --> 01:21:26.915
THE ADMINISTRATION CONCERNS THAT

01:21:26.982 --> 01:21:29.184
A COUNTY MATCH COULD RESULT IN

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.419
UNEQUAL TREATMENT FOR FOSTER

01:21:31.486 --> 01:21:33.355
YOUTH ACROSS COUNTIES HOPING YOU

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.056
COULD COMMENT ON THAT I'LL START

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.391
WITH THE SECOND MOVIE TURNS MY

01:21:36.458 --> 01:21:37.826
IT AT CALLING THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:21:37.892 --> 01:21:39.861
FINANCE- AS IT RELATES TO THE

01:21:39.928 --> 01:21:41.563
AND EVEN IMPLEMENTATION WHAT WE

01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:42.597
WOULD NOTE THAT THE FAMILY

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:44.799
FINDING A RESPONSIBILITY IS A

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:45.500
RESPONSIBILITY THAT EXISTS

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:48.270
TODAY. I WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:21:48.336 --> 01:21:49.871
ACHIEVE IS LEVERAGING THOSE

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:51.439
FUNDS IN THOSE RESOURCES USING

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:53.308
AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED WORKS

01:21:53.375 --> 01:21:55.176
IN OUR EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES

01:21:55.243 --> 01:21:57.045
AT FURTHER AGAIN LEVERAGE THOSE

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.514
FUNDS AND CONTINUE THAT EFFORT-

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:03.184
WE ARE ABSOLUTELY INTENDING TO-

01:22:03.251 --> 01:22:04.986
TAKE THE LESSONS LEARNED IN THE

01:22:05.053 --> 01:22:06.421
AT BEST PRACTICES OUT OF THAT

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:07.422
COMPONENT AND APPLY THEM

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.057
UNIVERSALLY THE MATTER WHETHER

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:09.891
OR NOT A COUNTY IS

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.760
PARTICIPATING. AT SPECIFICALLY

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:13.128
IN THIS COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.863
SO THERE WILL BE A UNIVERSAL

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.231
APPLICATION IN THAT IN THAT

01:22:16.298 --> 01:22:18.033
SENSE IN TERMS OF THOSE

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:19.501
PRACTICES BUT RELATED TO PEPPERS

01:22:19.567 --> 01:22:21.269
I WILL TURN OVER TO JUST

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.004
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING

01:22:23.071 --> 01:22:23.872
I THINK ONE THING IS CLEAR

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.340
WHETHER THE THAT'S A GOOD HAVE

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:26.708
BEEN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:27.909
BETWEEN THE FLIPPERSFUNDING.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:30.178
FAMILY FUN AND SO THE PAPER

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:31.880
SPENDING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:22:31.946 --> 01:22:33.248
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CONTINUING

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:35.917
CARE REFORM THE IDEA WAS THAT AS

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:38.920
A RUNS WHERE TRANSITIONING YOUTH

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.522
FROM A CONGREGATE CARES INTO

01:22:40.588 --> 01:22:43.024
HOME BASED ON THE CARE SETTINGS

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:43.525
AT A QUICK PROCESS- THE

01:22:43.591 --> 01:22:44.759
MINISTRATION AND KNOWLEDGE THAT

01:22:44.826 --> 01:22:45.593
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WOULD

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:47.696
NEED TO BE EXPEDITED SO THE

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:48.563
RESULT FROM FUNDING PUT INTO A

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.467
SUPPLEMENT. AS DIRECTOR JOHNSONSAID THE COUNTY RESPONSIBILITIES

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:53.968
ALREADY THEY WERE REALIGNED FOR

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.670
THEM FOR FAMILY FIND IT SO

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:57.439
COMPARING THE TWO IS A SLIGHTLY

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.007
A THINK A LITTLE MISLEADING

01:22:59.074 --> 01:23:00.408
BECAUSE OF THAT NOW WITH THE

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:03.611
COUNTY MATCH- WE THINK THAT THAT

01:23:03.678 --> 01:23:05.213
THE IDEA THIS IS TO SUPPLEMENT

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:06.848
AGAIN THOSE ACTIVITIES AND THIS

01:23:06.915 --> 01:23:09.351
IS A CORE FUNCTION FOR COUNTIES

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:11.052
IN THE IDEAS TO HELP.

01:23:11.119 --> 01:23:12.020
INCENTIVIZE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE

01:23:12.087 --> 01:23:13.388
MAKING SURE THAT THE YOUTH ARE

01:23:13.455 --> 01:23:15.423
PUT INTO PLACE AND THAT IS FOR

01:23:15.490 --> 01:23:16.791
THEIR NEEDS SO WE DON'T SEE THAT

01:23:16.858 --> 01:23:18.927
THERE WOULD BE AN IN EQUITY

01:23:18.993 --> 01:23:19.861
THERE- BECAUSE AGAIN THESE ARE

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:26.768
RECENT THESE ARE ACTIVITIES THAT-ALREADY COUNT SHOULD BE. DOING

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:28.570
ANA REQUIRED TO DO THROUGH. TO

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:29.504
ELEVEN RELY RELATE. IT FOR SOME

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:31.172
OF US WE LIKE. AND SINCE

01:23:31.239 --> 01:23:32.440
VISITATION IT'S WHETHER CERTAIN

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.309
COUNTIES WILL GET LEFT BEHIND

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.944
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT MATCHING

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:38.213
THOSE FUNDS AND US THAT'S THE

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:40.081
INEQUITY THAT WERE CONCERNED

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:41.549
WITH IS A FOR LEAVING IT UP TO

01:23:41.616 --> 01:23:43.685
THE COUNTIES TO PUT THEIR

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:45.553
PORTION NOT. I UNDERSTAND WE'RE

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.489
TRYING TO LEVERAGE I JUST. AM

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:49.257
WORRIED ABOUT THE IMPLICATIONS

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:51.226
OF THAT DECISION UNTIL IT

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:53.061
CAPITAL LEAVE THAT OPEN FOR NOW

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.929
IF WE CAN. IF I'M IT JUST ONE

01:23:54.996 --> 01:23:56.464
MORE COMING ON THAT RECOGNIZING

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:59.334
THAT THAT IT WAS A THAT WAS PART

01:23:59.401 --> 01:23:59.934
OF THE POINT OF TWO THOUSAND

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:00.535
REALIGNMENT. COUNTIES DO YOU

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:02.737
HAVE A LOOK AT A LOCAL CONTROL

01:24:02.804 --> 01:24:03.905
WHERE THEY CAN IDENTIFY AND

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.740
PRIORITIZE WHERE THEIR FUNDING

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.942
WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE TO ON

01:24:08.009 --> 01:24:08.977

EVERYDAY AND COLLECT SURVEY DATA

WILL BE BETTERPOSITIONED

01:26:10.231 --> 01:26:12.333
UNDERSTANDS THE UNDERLYING

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.437
CALFRESH ELIGIBILITY COSTS. MY

01:26:16.504 --> 01:26:18.606
HOPE IS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:20.141
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS TO THOSE

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.377
WHO ARE RECEIVING SERVICES AND

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:25.413
SO- IT AT SOME POINT TO- WE

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.982
SEEING. CALL CENTER WAIT TIMES

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:30.385
GOING UP ARE WE SAYING HANG UPS

01:26:30.451 --> 01:26:32.554
ARE WE SEEING TRENDS AND

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:35.356
DISCONTINUANCE SAYS ERROR RATES.

01:26:35.423 --> 01:26:37.325
THESE OCCUR WHEN WE DON'T HAVE

01:26:37.392 --> 01:26:39.360
THE APPROPRIATE ELIGIBILITY

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:41.563
FUNDING AND I'M HOPING TO SEE IF

01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:46.100
WE ARE NOTICING ANY TRENDS-

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:47.235
BECAUSE OF THE DECISIONS WE MAY

01:26:47.302 --> 01:26:49.270
MAKE. SO I THINK FOR SOME OF THE

01:26:49.337 --> 01:26:50.605
STUFF AND QUESTIONS ARE UP TO

01:26:50.672 --> 01:26:52.574
DEFERRED TO- DIRECTOR JOHNSON

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.577
BUT- I TO REITERATE I BELIEVE

01:26:55.643 --> 01:26:57.278
IT'S A I KNOW THE IT WAS A

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:58.580
LITTLE DIFFICULT FOR OF THE-

01:26:58.646 --> 01:26:59.781
AUDIO THERE. BUT THE

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:01.416
ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO

01:27:01.482 --> 01:27:02.850
WORKING WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:05.954
DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION ON REBATES

01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.088
IN LOOKING THE METHODOLOGY FOR

01:27:07.155 --> 01:27:08.656
THE ADMINISTRA ADMINISTRATION

01:27:08.723 --> 01:27:10.291
COMPONENT OF THE CALIPHATE'S

01:27:10.358 --> 01:27:13.261
PROGRAM- JUST A TO ME FALLS A

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.063
LITTLE BIT ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:15.863
SAID IT'S JUST. THE SIXTY

01:27:15.930 --> 01:27:18.032

01:27:21.936 --> 01:27:23.571
TOGETHER HOW THAT WAS ASSOCIATE

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:25.707
WHERE WHERE THE WORKLOAD WAS IT

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:29.711
WAS BEING MESSED- SO AGAIN WE

01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:31.546
RECOGNIZE THAT THE THIS IS

01:27:31.613 --> 01:27:33.214
SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO WORK ON.

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:34.916
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT A

01:27:34.983 --> 01:27:36.117
SINGLE PAYER ADVOCATES ARE IN

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:38.086

SURE I'M HAPPY TO SHARE

01:27:48.196 --> 01:27:49.430
PROGRAMMATIC LEE APPLICATION

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:50.865
PROCESSING TIMES HAVE NOT BEEN

01:27:50.932 --> 01:27:52.433
IMPACTED AS THE TIMELINESS OF

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.302
THE THIRTY DAY PROCESSING. HAS

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.670
STAYED RELATIVELY THE SAME OVER

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:57.538
THE LAST THREE YEARS THE

01:27:57.605 --> 01:27:59.073
TIMELINESS OF EXPEDITED

HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE AGREED UPON

01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:49.891
METHODOLOGY WHERE WE LOOKED AT

01:28:51.192 --> 01:28:53.027
INCREMENTS THAT HE BELIEVES IN

01:28:53.094 --> 01:28:54.595
CHILE THE INCREMENTS BASED ON

01:28:54.662 --> 01:28:56.230
CASE LOW TO JUST MINCE WOULD

01:28:56.297 --> 01:28:59.000

AS WE ARE GLAD TO CONTINUE

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:03.104
DISCUSSIONS AROUND HOW

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.306
FREQUENTLY- WE ACTUALLY TAKE A

01:29:05.373 --> 01:29:07.141
LOOK AT THAT METHODOLOGY- GOING

FORWARD AT. IT AGAIN IT WAS- ALL

01:29:09.977 --> 01:29:11.345
OF OUR BEST THINKING AT THE TIME

CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS TO ENSURE

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:19.020
THAT AGAIN ULTIMATELY ALL THE

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.922
WORKING INVESTMENT WE PUT INTO

01:29:20.988 --> 01:29:22.490
SUPPORT AT THOSE FAMILIES AT IS

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:25.126
TRUE SO GLAD TO CONTINUE TO TALK

01:29:25.193 --> 01:29:26.227
FURTHER. INTRODUCTORY THE MONEY

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.296
RESPONDED IN A BIG. THERE ALSO

01:29:28.362 --> 01:29:29.397
IS SOME CLARIFICATION AS WE

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.898
PROVIDED ON HOW THE FUNDING IS

01:29:30.965 --> 01:29:32.734
SURVIVOR CAL WORKS AS WELL WITH

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:35.470
WITH A PROPOSAL SO. CAL WORKS

01:29:35.536 --> 01:29:37.438
ADMINISTRATION FUNDING IS. BASED

01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:40.208
OFF A CASELOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:42.543
HAD AN ESTIMATED CASELOAD AT THE

01:29:42.610 --> 01:29:43.377
TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT FOR NOW

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.713
WHICH IS CURRENT YEAR. ENDS IF

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.515
WE FUNDS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:48.750
OF THE STATE PROVIDES A LEVEL

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.451
FUNDING EQUAL TO WHAT WE THINK

01:29:50.518 --> 01:29:52.720
THAT CASE WILL BE WHEN WE DO OUR

01:29:52.787 --> 01:29:53.755
REVIVED THE GOVERNOR'S REVISED

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:54.856
BUDGET. I WITH THE REVISED

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:57.258
FORECASTED CASELOAD. CANCELED

01:29:57.325 --> 01:29:58.593
WAS A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:00.762
CURRENT YEAR WAS M. REVISED TO

01:30:00.828 --> 01:30:02.497
BE DOWN. AND THEN IT GOVERNOR'S

01:30:02.563 --> 01:30:03.297
ADMIT REVISION HURTING A

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:05.733
FURTHER. WELL WE WOULD REDUCE

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.335
WHAT WE THINK THE CASE IT WILL

01:30:07.401 --> 01:30:08.903
BE BASED ON THE PRODUCTION WE

01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:11.072
DON'T PULL BACK THAT FUNDING

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:11.739
ASSOCIATED. MEN AND THAT'S BEEN

01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:13.474
THE CASE SINCE- THE INITIAL

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.876
PANDEMIC SO WE'VE ASSUMED

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.344
ANYTHING VALLEY I WOULD AGREE ON

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:22.316
THIS. WE ORIGINALLY- COLLECTOR

01:30:22.383 --> 01:30:23.851
I'LL TRANSFER OUT WHAT WAS GOING

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:24.619
HAPPEN QUESO. WE FUNDED THE

01:30:24.685 --> 01:30:27.121
WERE. THAT HOW NOT A- AT THE

01:30:27.188 --> 01:30:28.656
HIGHER LAW. AND WE'VE NEVER PULL

01:30:28.723 --> 01:30:29.490
THAT BACK. SECOND AS DIRECTOR

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:30.892
JOHNSON MENTIONED THE STATE

01:30:30.958 --> 01:30:31.492
COLLECTIVELY CAME TOGETHER AND

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:32.593
WITH THE AGREEMENT OF THE COUNTY

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.895
WELFARE DIRECTOR SO SHE

01:30:33.961 --> 01:30:35.663
STAKEHOLDERS CAME UP WITH THE

01:30:35.730 --> 01:30:36.597
METHODOLOGY. THEY WOULD ADDRESS

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:38.933
BIG SWINGS IN INCREASE. OF A

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.002
CASELOAD AND DECREASES SO THIS

01:30:41.068 --> 01:30:43.271
RAMP DOWN INCREMENTAL CHANGES

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:44.806
DIRECTED JOHNSON MENTIONED. AND

01:30:44.872 --> 01:30:47.942
THEN THIRDLY HOMAGE. THERE'S NOT

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.510
A CLEAR FOR A DROP OFF IN

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.912
FUNDING. THE TWENTY ONE BUDGET

01:30:50.978 --> 01:30:52.814
OUT THE STATE MADE A ONE TIME

01:30:52.880 --> 01:30:54.115
AUGMENTATION- OR EXCUSE ME

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.616
AUGMENTED THE BASE FUNDING LEVEL

01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:57.451
TO THAT METHODOLOGY WE AGREED TO

01:30:57.518 --> 01:30:59.153
THREE YEARS AGO BY FORTY MILLION

01:30:59.220 --> 01:31:00.555
ON GUN. WHICH ISN'T IS REFLECTED

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:02.190
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS. AS

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:03.891
WELL AS A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION

01:31:03.958 --> 01:31:06.093
ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION FOR

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.529
THIS CURRENT YEAR. SO I THINK

01:31:08.596 --> 01:31:09.831
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS INTO

01:31:09.897 --> 01:31:10.832
IT WHEN WE'RE SHARING THIS

01:31:10.898 --> 01:31:12.400
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STATE NOT

01:31:12.466 --> 01:31:14.068
PROVIDING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:16.504
HOURS ON END. WE ACTUALLY HAVE

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:18.172
BEEN AND THE WORKLOAD IS AN

01:31:18.239 --> 01:31:19.440
APPEARANCE BECAUSE OUR CASELOAD

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.575
IS DOWN AND THAT'S THAT'S OUR

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:22.844
POSITION ON THAT SO. HAPPY TO

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:23.411
CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:25.813
BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.748
CLARIFIED WE DON'T THINK THAT

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:29.784
THERE IS. A CLEAR FOR DROP OFF

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.485
OUR KIND OF FUND UNITS WITHIN.

01:31:31.552 --> 01:31:33.454
THE AGREED UPON METHODOLOGY THE

01:31:33.521 --> 01:31:35.957
STATE HAS. HAS DEVELOPED- I AM

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.458
HEARING YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD

01:31:37.525 --> 01:31:38.960
TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.795
THE CONCERN WE HAVE IS AT THEIR

01:31:40.862 --> 01:31:44.198
TIME OF NEED FOR CUTTING. THOSE

01:31:44.265 --> 01:31:46.000
PROGRAMS AND THEIR ABILITY TO

01:31:46.067 --> 01:31:47.802
HAVE THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT'S

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.937
HARMING THE PROGRAMS THAT. WE

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:51.105
NEED TO BE SUPPORTING RIGHT NOW

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.441
AND SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S NOT THE

01:31:53.507 --> 01:31:56.077
CASE SINCE FOR YOUR- BUT WITH

01:31:56.143 --> 01:31:57.311

01:35:13.808 --> 01:35:16.310
FUNDED IS REALLY CRITICAL TO

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.745
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:35:17.812 --> 01:35:19.680
THAT TODAY. WE DO HAVE- JUST A

01:35:19.747 --> 01:35:20.915
COUPLE AREAS OF CONCERN THE FLAG

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.883
I THINK YOU'VE ACTUALLY ASK

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.351
QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH OF THEM SO

01:35:24.418 --> 01:35:27.088
FAR- FIRST WITH REGARDS TO OUR

01:35:27.154 --> 01:35:28.956
ABILITY OPERATIONS IF ADOPTED AS

01:35:29.023 --> 01:35:30.658
PROPOSED MAYOR VISION WHAT IS

01:35:30.724 --> 01:35:33.227
UNITED CUT BOTH CALFRESH AND CAL

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:35.029
WORKS ELIGIBILITY OPERATIONS AT

01:35:35.096 --> 01:35:36.564
A TIME WHEN THE CASES ARE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:37.731
PROJECTED TO INCREASE AND BOTH

01:35:37.798 --> 01:35:40.234
PROGRAMS AND HOW IT WORKS WHAT

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:41.769
WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT THE

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:42.636
COUNTIES WOULD BE FORCED TO

01:35:42.703 --> 01:35:44.371
SHIFT FUNDS FROM PLANET SERVICES

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.273
THIS IS WOULD COME AT A TIME AND

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.942
WE'RE BEING ASKED TO RE ENGAGE.

01:35:48.008 --> 01:35:49.076
PEOPLE'S CLOCKS ARE TICKING

01:35:49.143 --> 01:35:51.078
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE TO THE-

01:35:51.145 --> 01:35:52.746
THE NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:53.647
THEY'RE AT THAT THEY ARE

01:35:53.714 --> 01:35:56.317
ELIGIBLE WE- ARE ALSO SEEING

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:58.219
OPPORTUNITIES TO GET OUR CLIENTS

01:35:58.285 --> 01:36:00.221
INTO JOBS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT

01:36:00.287 --> 01:36:01.655
HAVE BEEN COMPETITIVE FOR IN THE

01:36:01.722 --> 01:36:03.290
PAST THE PEOPLE ARE HIRING

01:36:03.357 --> 01:36:04.792
THEY'RE PAYING WHILE THEY'RE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:06.861
WILLING TO TRAIN BUT WE NEED TO

01:36:06.927 --> 01:36:08.863
CONNECT THEM WITH THOSE JOBS AND

01:36:08.929 --> 01:36:09.797
PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT THEY

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:11.732
NEED IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO THAT

01:36:11.799 --> 01:36:13.234
BECAUSE WE NEED TO KEEP THE

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:14.768
FRONT DOOR OPEN OR MANDATED TO

01:36:14.835 --> 01:36:15.769
DO THIS ELIGIBILITY RELATED

01:36:15.836 --> 01:36:18.072
SERVICES. WITH THE RESPECT TO

01:36:18.139 --> 01:36:19.740
FINANCE WE ARE SPENDING THE

01:36:19.807 --> 01:36:21.642
MONEY NOW THOSE COSTS ARE BEING

01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:22.910
INCURRED BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:25.012
WOULD NOT BE SPENDING THE MONEY

01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:26.647
SO CUTTING IT WOULD BE A CUT TO

01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:28.449
OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:36:28.516 --> 01:36:30.751
IN CALFRESH I'M IN ADDITION TO

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.853
THE EXPEDITED SERVICES ISSUES

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:35.089
THAT DIRECTOR JOHNSON NOTED WE

01:36:35.156 --> 01:36:36.524
ALSO HAVE BEEN SEEING INCREASED

01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:38.392
TURN IN A HIGHER ERROR RATE

01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:40.427
DURING THE PANDEMIC BOTH OF

01:36:40.494 --> 01:36:41.495
THOSE THINGS WE THINK CAN BE

01:36:41.562 --> 01:36:43.330
DIRECTLY CONTRIBUTED TO THE FACT

01:36:43.397 --> 01:36:44.565
THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE

01:36:44.632 --> 01:36:49.770
FURTHER. AND FURTHER OUT. FROM

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:50.704
THE YEAR TWO. AND WHAT. AND THE

01:36:50.771 --> 01:36:52.506
REASON I MENTION IS. THAT IS HOW

01:36:52.573 --> 01:36:54.241
ARE. CURRENT STAFF ARE FUNDED.

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:56.911
BY THE STATE AS IF IT IS STILL

01:36:56.977 --> 01:36:58.879
COSTING US. LIKE IT DID IN TWO

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.014
THOUSAND AND ONE WE'VE NOT

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:01.348

BUSINESS INCREASE. FOR OVER

01:37:02.983 --> 01:37:04.418
TWENTY YEARS. THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.619
DESPERATE FOR THAT REBASED

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.555
WORKER. WE UNDERSTAND AND

01:37:07.621 --> 01:37:09.990
SUPPORT PUTTING IT OFF YOU DON'T

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:11.559
WANT TO DO A READ A STORY A

01:37:11.625 --> 01:37:13.327
PENDANT IT'S A MESS. BUT IN THE

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:14.695
MEANTIME WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.863
AS A DOWN PAYMENT. THAT'S SIXTY

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.331
MILLION DOLLARS THE METHOD. FOR

01:37:17.398 --> 01:37:23.404
THE WERE. WE DO LOOK ABOUT WE'RE

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:28.876
OVER SPEND BY WE'LL- WOULD WHAT

01:37:28.943 --> 01:37:36.817
WE WERE HAVE SEE. IF WE MORE.

01:37:36.884 --> 01:37:38.552
COUNTIES ARE ALREADY SPENDING IT

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:40.588
NOW WE NEED THAT HELP TO BE ABLE

01:37:40.654 --> 01:37:42.790
TO CONTINUE PROVIDING SERVICES.

01:37:42.856 --> 01:37:43.757
AND TRY TO HELP STOP THE

01:37:43.824 --> 01:37:45.960
HEMORRHAGING QUITE FRANKLY SO WE

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.828
CAN GET TO THAT NEW METHODOLOGY

01:37:47.895 --> 01:37:49.230
. JUST QUICKLY ON THE TROUBLE

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:50.798
FOR AREA WE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.299
THE PROPOSED INVESTMENTS AS YOU

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.602
HEARD FROM THE L. A. O. THE

01:37:54.668 --> 01:37:55.536
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE IS NOT

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:57.938
OUT. WE DO- AS WE UNDERSTAND

01:37:58.005 --> 01:37:59.707
SORT OF THE DESCRIPTION OF IN

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:00.641
PARTICULAR THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.476
MILLION DOLLARS. IT SOUNDS LIKE

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:04.211
IT WOULD BE- FOR SOMEWHAT NARROW

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.614
OF A SET OF SERVICES NOT AS

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.283
BROAD AS THE FLIPPERS SERVICES

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.517
THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.286
IN THE PAST. ALL KNOW THAT THE

01:38:12.353 --> 01:38:13.520
REASON WHY COUNTIES RECEIVE HER

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:15.222
PURSE DURING THE CCR IS BECAUSE

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:17.591
WE HAVE NOT. ACTUALLY BEEN

01:38:17.658 --> 01:38:19.660
REQUIRED TO DO THAT RECRUITMENT

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.128
AT THE TIME OF TWENTY ELEVEN

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:23.030

C. R. WITH AN ACTOR THAT THAT

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:26.367
BECAME A REQUIREMENT. LOS

DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THAT.

01:38:34.942 --> 01:38:36.777
SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:37.711
THAT THE FUNDING BE PROVIDED

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.813

THINK ABOUT THE FAMILIES AND

AND THE INTERESTS OF THE STATE

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:37.204

PROPOSAL TO INCREASE POWER STRIP

BY ELEVEN PERCENT. THAT'S

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:46.847
OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT IS A

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:49.049
GOOD THING. BUT IT ALLS FRANKLY

01:39:49.116 --> 01:39:50.384
FAR SHORT OF THE AGREEMENT THAT

01:39:50.451 --> 01:39:52.353
WAS MADE FOUR YEARS AGO TO

01:39:52.419 --> 01:39:56.323
INCREASE OUR TRANSIT. ASSISTANCE

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.891
ONE WHICH WOULD NOT KNOW CHARGE

01:39:57.958 --> 01:39:59.760
NO FOR. IN THE STATE BUT HAVE A

STILL NEED TO GET THERE. AND I'M

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.465
HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE THE

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:07.167
YEAR THAT WE DO IT IN THIS

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:10.371
YEAR'S BUDGET- ON S. ASIDE FROM

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:12.873
. WE ARE ASKING FOR THE SECOND

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.875
PART OF THE GRANT TO BE

01:40:14.942 --> 01:40:17.644
XCELERATED TO JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:18.979
TWENTY THREE SO THE RECIPIENTS

01:40:19.046 --> 01:40:20.714
DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AN ENTIRE

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:23.050
YEAR WE'RE VERY DISMAYED TO HEAR

01:40:23.117 --> 01:40:25.386
THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS. A

01:40:25.452 --> 01:40:27.321
REDUCE THE SIZE OF THAT INCREASE

01:40:27.388 --> 01:40:28.789
IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE A

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:31.258
CASELOAD INCREASE FOR YEARS WHEN

01:40:31.325 --> 01:40:33.227
CASE THOSE WERE DECLINING NONE

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.728
OF THOSE GENERAL FUND SAVINGS

01:40:34.795 --> 01:40:36.764
ARE EVER PASSED ALONG TO THE TO

01:40:36.830 --> 01:40:38.332
THE RECIPIENTS IN THE FORMER

01:40:38.399 --> 01:40:39.533
BRAND INCREASES BUT NOW THE

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.668
REVERSE IS HAPPENING THAT THAT'S

01:40:41.735 --> 01:40:42.836
SOMETHING I THINK THE COMMITTEE

01:40:42.903 --> 01:40:44.838
SHOULD TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:48.142
AT- ON CHILD SUPPORT. AGAIN

01:40:48.208 --> 01:40:50.010

FORMALLY ASSISTED CASES BUT WE

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:57.584
STILL ARE ASKING THE COMMITTEE

01:40:57.651 --> 01:40:59.052
TO PASS THROUGH ALL CHILD

01:40:59.119 --> 01:41:00.988

POOREST CHILDREN IN OUR STATE

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.493
AND SO WE'RE HOPING AGAIN THAT

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:08.629
THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:09.797
GET THAT INTO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:11.932
