CALL THE THAT'S GOOD MORNING. WE ARE GOING TO CALL IT FEELS LIKE AFTERNOON. WE ARE CALLING THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BACK TO ORDER. MADAM SECRETARY COULD YOU CALL THE ROLL PLEASE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING HERE ARAMBULA. BLOOM. CHAVEZ HERE OBERNOLTE. SENATOR MITCHELL. MORE LOCK. NIELSEN. ROTH SKINNER. THANK YOU SO TODAY WILL BE GOING THROUGH THE. FOR MAJOR PIECES AND. OF THE OF THE BUDGET CONFERENCE. WILL BE TACKLING THEM AT A VERY HIGH OVERVIEW AND. REVIEWING MAJOR ISSUES IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS SUBCOMMITTEES ARE WE'RE GOING TO START FIRST WITH EDUCATION THEN GO TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. THEN RESOURCES AND THEN LAST WILL BE AYE GENERAL GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC SAFETY. SO WITH THAT WE'LL START WITH EDUCATION WE HAVE. MUST COME FROM HELLO TO GIVE US AN OVERVIEW ON EDUCATION. ASSN JENNIFER CAN LEAD TO ANALYSTS AM IF YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE OF YOUR EDUCATION AGENDA. THE FIRST TWO BULLETS HIGHLIGHT THE MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING BOTH HOUSES OVERALL EDUCATION PACKAGE SO YOU HEARD IN THE OVERVIEW A HEARING YESTERDAY BOTH HOUSES HAVE TAKEN HIGHER GENERAL FUND REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS. BOTH HOUSES HAVE HIGHER PROPERTY TAX ASSUMPTIONS AND THE HIGHER PROPERTY TAX ASSUMPTION IS REDUCING REQUIRED GENERAL FUND PART NINETY EIGHT SPENDING DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. SO THE LAST TWO BULLETS SHOW YOU THE OF FACTS OF THOSE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS TO CONCEDE I EVEN THOUGH BOTH HOUSES HAVE HIGHER REVENUE. ITEM THEY HAVE THE SAME OVERALL PROP NINETY EIGHT SPENDING AS THE GOVERNOR FOR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THE ASSEMBLY HAS JUST SLIGHTLY LOWER SPENDING THAN EITHER THE GOVERNOR AND THE SUN AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN NOT SET A DUE TO A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN THEIR UNDERLYING REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS. PAGE SIX SHOWS YOU GENERAL FUND SPENDING BY SEGMENT SO YOU CAN SEE PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND SPENDING. IS LOWER ALMOST FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LOWER IN BOTH HOUSES THEN THE GOVERNOR AGAIN THAT'S JUST DUE TO HIGHER ASSUMED LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES. IF YOU STAND ON THE LIST OF SEGMENTS UNDER THE NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND PROGRAMS YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SENATE AS MANY MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR FOR EACH OF THE SIX SEGMENTS. YES SOMEBODY A SPENDING MORE ON FIVE OF THEM IN THE SAME ON ONE. IN TOTAL FOR NON PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND SPENDING YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SENATE SPENDING SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR. THE ASSEMBLY SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHT MILLION MORE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVEN YOU CAN SEE PROP NINETY EIGHT SPENDING BY FISCAL YEAR SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IT ASSEMBLY ARE AT THE SAME PLACE AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. YOU CAN SEE THIS ON BILLION GONNA SLIGHTLY LOWER AND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. ALTHOUGH THAN SPENDING LEVELS ARE VIRTUALLY THE SAME ACROSS THE PERIOD IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CHART YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SUN IS SPENDING MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR FOR ONGOING PURPOSES LASTS FOR ONE TIME. AND THE ASSEMBLY AS SPENDING EVEN MORE FOR ON GOING AND LESS FOR ONE TIME. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE EIGHT. AND YOU CAN THE GOVERNOR IN SEVENTEEN AM SORRY IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS IS DEDICATING ALMOST A BILLION OF THOSE FUNDS FOR ONE TIME SPENDING. AND BY COMPARISON THE SENATE HAS A HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION IN ONE TIME IN THE ASSEMBLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY AND ONE TIME. SO THE LAST ONE TIME SPENDING YOU HAVE IN YOUR NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE THE MORE VULNERABLE YOUR ON GOING PROGRAMS AND OUR NINETY EIGHT WILL BE IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THE ASSEMBLY ALSO SUPPORT SOME ON GOING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS AND PROGRAMS I'M SORRY WITH ONE TIME FUNDS SPECIFICALLY THEY'RE TAKING FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION AN ONGOING SPECIAL AND COST AND FUNNY NOT WITH ONE TIME MONEY. SO THE ASSEMBLY PLANT AGAIN IS BANKING ON NINETEEN TWENTY MINIMUM GUARANTEE BEING AT LEAST THAT MUCH HIGHER SO THAT IT CAN SUPPORT EXISTING SPECIAL ED PROGRAMS. THE GOVERNOR IN BOTH HOUSES COMMIT TO PROVIDE MEAN AN AUTOMATIC COLA FOR LC A FIVE WHICH IS AGAIN THE LARGEST PROP NINETY EIGHT PROGRAM MOVING FORWARD. SO JUST TO GIVE YOU A HEADS UP AS TO WHAT'S ON THE HORIZON PROVIDING ELSE IF OFF WITH A COLON NINETEEN TWENTY AT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATED RATE OF TWO POINT SIX PERCENT. WOULD COST ONE AND A HALF BILLION. SO AGAIN AFFECTIVELY ALL THE PLANS ARE COMMITTEE IN THAT GROWTH IN THE GUARANTEE IN NINETEEN TWENTY HAS AT LEAST ONE AND A HALF BILLION TO COVER THAT COMMITMENT. SO IF YOU TAKE ALL THREE OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS LAST ONE TIME SPENDING FUNDING SOME ONGOING PROGRAM WITH ONE TIME MONIES COMMITTING SO WHAT COLIN NEXT YEAR. IT'S JUST CREATING SOME COST PRESSURE FOR YOU TO I'M RECOGNIZED IN NINETEEN TWENTY. WHEN WE WERE ON WHAT A MODERATE RECESSIONARY SCENARIO LOOKS LIKE IN NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAVE THE GUARANTEE FOLLOWING ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN FIVE PERCENT. SO UNDER THAT SCENARIO AGAIN YOU WANTED TO HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BACK FILL FOR SPECIAL ED PROGRAMS YOU WANT AND HAVE ENOUGH FOR THE COLA YOU'D HAVE TO TURN TO THE BASE. AND CONSIDER WHAT TO DO INSIDE THE BASE. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE NINE. YOU CAN SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR AND BOTH HOUSES OUR SPENDING ROUGHLY SIX POINT TWO BILLION IN ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR KEY TWELFTH. OVER THE OVER THE BUDGET WINDOW. THE GOVERNOR IS DEDICATING SIXTY ONE PERCENT OF THAT ONGOING PURPOSES THE SENATE'S AT SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT ON THE ASSEMBLY THAT EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. SO THE NEXT FEW PAGES PAGES TEN THROUGH TWELVE JUST PROVIDE DETAIL ON THE DIFFERENCES IN THAT PART MAY BE A KEY TWELVE PM. ACTIONS OF BETWEEN THE HOUSES. AND MOST OF THOSE ARE ITEMIZED LEADER IN YOUR AGENDA SOME JUST GOING TO SKIP OVER THOSE AND TURN TO PAGE THIRTEEN. PAGE THIRTEEN GIVES YOU I'M SHOWS YOU THAT THE GOVERNOR IN BOTH HOUSES ARE SPENDING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN NEW SPENDING. AND BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND SENATE OF THAT NEW SPENDING ABOUT FIFTY I'M SORRY FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ITS DEDICATED FOR ONGOING PROGRAM SYSTEM LEASE JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER WHEN IT COMES TO THE COLLEGES. AS SIXTY TWO PERCENT. THE LARGEST ONGOING INCREASES ARE FOR APPORTIONMENT SON THE LARGEST ONE TIME AS FOR THE COLLEGES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE MOST OF THOSE ARE ITEMIZED LATER IN YOUR AGENDA. SOME ALSO GONNA SKIP PAGES FOURTEEN FIFTEEN THERE JUST FOR YOUR ON AND SIXTEEN THERE FOR JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HOUSES. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SEVENTEEN AND THIS FOCUSES ON CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED WITH A COMBINATION OF PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND NON PROPPING IT GENERAL FUND INTO FEDERAL GRANTS SO WHEN YOU COMBINE INCREASE SPENDING ACROSS ALL OF THOSE FUNDS SOURCES. THE GOVERNOR IS INCREASING SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE MILLION. YOU CAN SEE THE SENATE IS UP AT NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION AND THE ASSEMBLY AS AT ONE POINT ONE BILLION. MOST OF THE ON GOING SPENDING AS FOR ADDITIONAL SLOTS AND RATE INCREASES AND A LARGE SHARE OF THE ONE TIME SPENDING AS TO HOLD CHILDCARE PROVIDERS FIND A OBTAIN AND RENOVATES FACILITIES. THE NEXT TWO PAGES ARE AGAIN JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES MORE SPECIFICALLY THOSE ARE ALSO ITEMIZE LATER IN THE AGENDA. SO IF YOU TURN TO HIGHER EDUCATION PAGE TWENTY YOU SEE AN OVERVIEW OF SPENDING FIRST YES YOU. AS WITH CHILDCARE BOTH HOUSES SPEND NOTABLY MORE ON THE UNIVERSITY IS THE GOVERNOR INCREASES GENERAL FUND SUPPORT BY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE MILLION. THE SENATE IS UP AT FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT MILLION AND THE ASSEMBLY JUST SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE SENATE AT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE MILLION. BOTH OF THE HOUSES DEDICATE. THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE MILLION FOR ONGOING PURPOSES SO THAT ONGOING INCREASES PRIMARILY FOR EXISTING STAFF THEIR SALARIES AND BENEFITS AND HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF. THE ONETIME MONEY UNDER BOTH PLANS AS PRIMARILY FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. NEXT PAGES ARE THERE FOR YOUR REFERENCE AND THEN FINALLY ON YOU SEE. PAGE AT TWENTY THREE YOU CAN SEE THE OVERVIEW FOR ED. GOVERNOR'S INCREASING GENERAL FUND SUPPORT AT YOU SEE BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION AGAIN BOTH HOUSES ARE HIGHER SIMILAR TO SEE US YOU'LL. SENATE'S OUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE MILLION AND ASSEMBLY AS A SLIGHTLY LOWER AT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE MILLION. BOTH HOUSES ARE DEDICATING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF THAT TOTAL INCREASE IN SPENDING TIME ONGOING PROGRAMS AND WITH YOUSEE THE ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT PRIMARILY BEFORE EXISTING STAFF SALARIES AND BENEFITS AS WELL AS HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF. BOTH HOUSES HAVE ABOUT TWO% HUNDRED MILLION AND ONE TIMES SPENDING FOR YOU SEE. I'M FOR THE SENATE ON THE SENATE SIDE THEY DEDICATE MOST OF THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND ON THE ASSEMBLY SIGNED AND OTHER KEY MOST OF IT TO UC'S OUR RETIREMENT PROGRAM AND THEY TIE CONDITION TO IT THAT YOU SEE MAKE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS PENSION PLANS. SO THAT'S AN OVERVIEW I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEFORE YOU DIVE INTO ISSUE ONE. GREAT THANK YOU. BULLETIN THIS CONSTANT FORMER FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MURES ANY COST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WANTED TO START OF. BY JUST PROVIDING SOME HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGES JUST UP ITEM CONTACT ABOUT AND SOME OF THE DIFFERENCES. WITHIN PROP NINETY EIGHT AND AND PERHAPS STRANGELY EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSES REVENUE ADOPTIONS ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S ACTUALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE GUARANTEE IS IT REALLY CHANGING ACROSS THOSE THREE PLANS. AND THAT'S LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TEST. OF PROP NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS IT IS A TEST TWO MONTHS IT MIGHT SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE DISARM THAT EVEN THOUGH THE REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT THAT THE GUARANTEE ITSELF ISN'T REALLY CHANGING WILDLY. THAT SAID I THINK. SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WILL OFFER AS WE GET INTO MORE SPECIFIC ISSUE AREAS WITHIN NINETY EIGHT. HAVE TO DO WITH THE MIX OF ONE TIME VERSES ON GOING IN SOME WAYS A MICROCOSM OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING IN THE BUDGET AS A WHOLE. ON THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOCUSED ON PROVIDING. LESSEN THE ON GOING SIDE AND REALLY FOCUSING THAT ON ON LCF ACT AND BASS FUNDING ON END OF PUTTING MORE ON THE ONE TIME SIDE SO. THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN THE GUARANTEE IS WHERE THE DIFFERENCES LIE. ADDITIONALLY AS I MISS KUHN POINTED OUT ON THE PROPERTY TAX ASSUMPTIONS WILL. DRIVE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE MIX OF DOLLARS WITHIN THE GUARANTEE AND IS A DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR. SAVINGS TO THE GENERAL FUND BASED ON HOW MANY MORE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. R. ASSUMES. LASTLY I WOULD JUST KNOW I'M AS THE ANALYSTS POINTED OUT AND THAT THERE IS A PRETTY WIDE VARIANCE IN THE ONGOING COST OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND IT INCLUDES THREE POINT SIX BILLION AN ON GOING COSTS THE SENATE'S UP FOUR POINT FOUR SEVEN IN THE ASSEMBLY THAT CLOSE TO. FIVE BILLION ON MEN SO THOSE WILL AND. IMPACTS ON AS THE ALICE HAS POINTED OUT IF WE WERE TO HIT A ROUGH PATCH. JUST LIKE THE GENERAL BUDGET ONE TIME FUNDS GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY A TO RIGHT THE SHIP IF SOMETHING SHOULD HAPPEN AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE I'M REALLY FOCUSED OUR EFFORTS ON THAT. A WITH THAT I WILL. GO BACK TO THE CHAIR AND ALL SPEAK MORE THAT THE HIGHER EDUCATION WE GET TO THOSE ISSUE ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. GREAT THANK YOU. I'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS. FROM THE COMMITTEE. OKAY SEEN DONE BEEN LIKE TO MOVE TO ISSUE. NUMBER ONE. WHICH IS JUST TO. GOING TO NEED LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FROM. SO IF. MISTER HARRISON FURTHER ISSUES ONE THROUGH THREE FROM LL ONE TO GET YES GOOD MORNING RYAN ANDERSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. SO THE FIRST ISSUE YOU'RE HEARING THIS MORNING IS ACTUALLY THE THE HEART OF YOUR K. TWELVE PACKAGES IN BOTH HOUSES IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AN ON GOING SPENDING COMMITMENTS. MOSTLY RELATED TO LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. SO THE LITTLE BACKGROUND AGAIN LC F.. IT'S STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN IS THE STATE'S PRIMARY MECHANISM FOR PROVIDING FUNDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CHARTER SCHOOLS IN THE STATE. NOW AT THE TIME IT WAS ADOPTED IN THIRTEEN FOURTEEN THE FORMULA COST ABOUT EIGHTEEN BILLION MORE THAN THE STATE HAD AVAILABLE SO THE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE JUST BEEN MAKING UP THAT GAP. OF IT SLOWLY I'D CREEPING CLOSER TO THAT STATUTORY TARGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED FULLY IMPLEMENTING LCF F. STARTING IN NINETEEN NINETEEN AND IN FACT ALL THREE PACKAGES BEFORE YOU. THINK GO A STEP FURTHER NOT ONLY FULLY IMPLEMENTING THOSE OF REGIONAL STATUTORY TARGETS PUT INCREASING THEM ACROSS THE BOARD BY SOME AMOUNT. NOW THIS ACROSS THE BOARD INCREASE IS NOT THE ONLY OPTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AVAILABLE FOR AUGMENTING OR ADJUSTING THE LC FF BUT IT IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. AND IT HAS TO A BIG BENEFITS FIRST IT HELPS ALL SCHOOLS ACCOMMODATE SOME ACROSS THE BOARD COST PRESSURES. INCLUDING IMPORTANTLY PENSION A CONTRIBUTION INCREASES WHICH I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT. AND SECOND FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU PUT INTO INCREASING THE LC FF ABOUT SIXTEEN SENSE GO SPECIFICALLY DEFINED INCREASED OR IMPROVE SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND DISADVANTAGED GROUPS. CURRENTLY THAT WOULD BE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS. NOW THE ASSEMBLY GOES A STEP FURTHER AND MAKES AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE LC FF AND SPECIFICALLY TO ITS DEFINITION OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS ADDING TO IT AND NEW GROUP. OF THAT WOULD BE THE GROUP THAT IS THE LOWEST PERFORMING ON STATEWIDE ASSESSMENTS OF READING AND MATH CURRENTLY THAT GROUP IS AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THEY ASSEMBLY ESTIMATES IT WOULD COST ABOUT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD THOSE STUDENTS. AND TO THE COUNT OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE WAY EL CFF WORKS IS IT'S AN UN DUPLICATED COUNT. A DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS SO CURRENTLY IF AS SOON AS BOTH LOW INCOME AND ENGLISH LEARNER THEY RECEIVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL RATE BUT THEY'D JUST RECEIVE THE SAME RATE AS A STUDENT WHO BELONGS TO ONE GROUP OR ANOTHER. I CURRENTLY MOST AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS FALL INTO ONE OF THESE CATEGORIES SO THIS THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION WOULD EXCLUSIVELY GO TOWARDS PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT LOW INCOME AND NOT ENGLISH LIKE. THAT SENATE HAS A PROPOSAL THAT IN SOME WAYS SOUND SIMILAR BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS VERY DIFFERENTLY THEY IT THEY SET ASIDE. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO CREATE A ONE TIME COMPETITIVE GRANT. FOR THE SCHOOLS SERVING AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO DON'T MEET STATEWIDE STANDARDS. NOW WE WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES. WHO ARE HAPPY DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THEM IF YOU'D LIKE TO DIG INTO THEM EARLY JUST LIKE TO KNOW THAT THAT AND THE STATE DOES HAVE MANY OTHER OPTIONS FOR? A ADDRESSING ITS PERSISTENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. OBVIOUSLY WILL NOT BE RESOLVED IN THIS THIS BUDGET DELIBERATION WILL BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL BE CONSIDERING. OF FOR MANY YEARS TO COME. OF THE FINAL ISSUE IN THIS PACKAGE IS THE ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATES TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO PARTIALLY EQUALIZE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING RATES. IN MANY WAYS THIS IS PART AND PARCEL OF THE AUSSIE FF EFFORT WANTED THE OBJECTIVES OF LC FF WAS TO REMOVE. HISTORICAL FUNDING INEQUITIES IN SCHOOL FINANCE IN THE STATE AND WITH FULL IMPLEMENTATION WE HAVE LARGELY DONE THAT THE LARGEST EXCEPTION IN SPECIAL EDUCATION WHERE RATES VARY FROM AS LITTLE AS FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT TO AS MUCH AS FIVE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS PER STUDENT. IS REALLY HAS NO LOGICAL BASIS IN THE USER RATES THAT HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN PLACE FOR DECADES. AND OUR OFFICE DOES RECOMMEND TO THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE'S COMFORTABLE COMMITTING SIN BICU ON GOING. EXPENDITURES THAT IT MAKES THIS OF ONE OF ITS HIGHEST PRIORITIES. I THINK YOU TO PART OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M FOR THE FIRST OUT IN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AGAIN THIS IS REALLY. ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD PREFER THAT AND BASS FUNDING OUR ON GOING FUNDING IS REALLY BALLOTS WITH THE ONE TIME FUNDING TO GET FLEXIBILITY WITHIN THE PACKAGE ITSELF. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT IN THE ASSEMBLIES VERSION THEY USED FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX MILLION ONE TIME RESOURCE SAYS. THAT WOULD BE USED TO FUND ONGOING PROBLEM PROGRAMS EXCUSE ME SUCH AS THE HEALTHY ABOUT SO WE WORRY ABOUT USING A ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCE FOR SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY ONGOING IN NATURE. SECONDLY ON THE. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD INCREASE THE LC FF A TARGET BASE RATES IN NINETEEN TWENTY. WE WOULD KNOW OBVIOUSLY I ANY NEW TARGETS WILL CREATE COST PRESSURES WITHIN THE GUARANTEE WE ASK MADE IT WOULD AYE. OUT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY BILLION AND LTFS COST PRESSURES WITHIN THE GUARANTEE. SECONDLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE WAGE STRUCTURE THE PER PEOPLE DATA USED IS BASED ON EXPENDITURES NOT APPROPRIATIONS SO THEORETICALLY IF THE DISTRICT HAD MONEY THAT THEY DIDN'T SPENDS FOR EXAMPLE THEY KEPT THEIR RESERVES. IT WOULDN'T BE CALCULATED UNDER THE STRUCTURE AND SO WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT. MOVING ONTO A BOTH HOUSES INCLUDING. DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPOSALS FOR. LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS. WE WOULD KNOW AGAIN. THAT IT'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE TIME VERSES ON GOING FOR THIS PROGRAM WHAT'S APPROPRIATE ONTO REALLY FUN THIS PROGRAM ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE HAVE SOME LEGAL CONCERNS WITH THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ASSEMBLIES PROPOSAL AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND PROP TWO ON NINE. LASTLY AND SPECIAL EDUCATION THE ADMINISTRATION HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON SPECIAL EDUCATION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL BUDGET CYCLES AND WE HAVE PUT FORWARD SEVERAL DIFFERENCE. GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS ON SPECIAL EDUCATION TO FURTHER FORTIFY THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF WAS AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE GOVERNANCE CHANGES TAKE PLACE BEFORE WE HAD BEGIN ENTERTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDING INTO THIS PROGRAM. WITH THAT HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WE THINK YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR NELSON. ON THE LOCAL FUNDING FORMULA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE. TO FOCUS. IN HELPING THE LOW PERFORMING. HOW ARE YOU DEFINING THAT UNIVERSE? I'D CURRENTLY THE LCF HAVE. PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. THE STUDENTS WHO FALL IN ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES. LOW INCOME STUDENTS THAT'S BASED ON ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT FEDERAL. FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEAL PROGRAM WHICH IS DEFINED AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POWER AND POVERTY NEXT ON THOSE WHO HAVE APPLIED. GETTING THOSE FUNDS IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. CURRENTLY ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION DOES MEET THAT DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME. IN ADDITION. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDS ARE PROVIDED TO ENGLISH LEARNER STUDENTS EASY STUDENTS WHO HAVE FIRST IDENTIFIED THAT THERE THE LANGUAGE WE SPEAK AT HOME IS SOMETHING OTHER THAN ENGLISH. AND SECOND HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY DO THAT THEMSELVES HAVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY. THE FINAL GRANT BASED ON ACTUAL TESTING OR JUST THAT'S CHRONIC DOUBLE TESTING OR AN ANECDOTE STATEMENT THERE'S A THERE'S A TWO STEP PROCESS TO IDENTIFYING IN ENGLISH ONE OF THE FIRST IS A. HOME LANGUAGE SURVEY. ON WHICH THE STUDENT MUST IDENTIFIED THAT AT HOME THEIR FAMILY SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH ALL THOSE STUDENTS ARE GIVEN. AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY AS ASSESSMENT AND STUDENTS WHO DO NOT PASS THAT ASSESSMENT ARE LABELED AS ENGLISH LEARNERS. THE FINAL CATEGORY OUR CHILDREN IN FOSTER. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THAT HOW IT IS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS I WAS A MEMBER MANY YEARS AGO OF SOMETHING CALLED THE FIRST BILINGUAL BICULTURAL. STUDENT THE. OR PARENT ADVISORY COUNCIL AND SO WE BY FOUGHT OVER THE YEARS. ONE OF THE THE CONCERNS OF AND CONSIDERATIONS I'D LIKE TO HAVE THIS COMMITTEE CONSIDER. THE THE FUNDING. MAKES SENSE. BUT. TO INCORPORATE IN OUR BUDGET IN THIS WOULD BE IN MANY AREAS. HOW DO WE? TEST HOW DO WE ASCERTAIN SUCCESS. DEFINING SUCCESS AND THEN HAVING IT CHECKED SO NEXT YEAR'S COMMITTEE. TO LOOK AT THE MONEY EXPENDED. AND SEE HOW MANY YOUTH WERE SERVING. THEN WHAT PROGRESS THEY'RE MAKING YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS HOW WE MIGHT ACHIEVE THAT. YEAH I THINK THE. A CERTAIN BASIC CHALLENGE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN STRUGGLING WITH FOR MANY YEARS IS. WHETHER. THE FOCUS SHOULD BE ON EDUCATIONAL INPUTS ARE ON STERN OUTCOMES AT THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WAS MUCH MORE FOCUSED ON. THESE ARE PARTICULAR TYPES OF EXPENDITURES ARE PROGRAMS THAT. WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR SCHOOLS TO RUN AND WE WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR RUNNING THOSE PROGRAMS WITH WITH LC FF WE'VE TRIED TO SWITCH. TOWARDS A SYSTEM THAT'S MORE BASED ON STERN OUTCOMES AND. AND MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR SCHOOLS TO SPEND ON WHATEVER PROGRAMS THEY THINK ARE NECESSARY WITH THE PROMISE THAT. THAT WOULD RESULT IN A IMPROVE SOON OUTCOMES I I WILL SAY AT THIS POINT THE RESULTS DO APPEAR SOMEWHAT MIXED ON THAT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN FOR EXAMPLE LOW INCOME AND NON LOW INCOME STUDENTS. HAS NOT NOTICEABLY BUDGETS IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF LCF FAT. SO I I DO THINK THAT THIS IS AN AREA WHERE. CONTINUED OVERSIGHT ON THE LEGISLATURE'S PART AND AND CONTINUE THINKING ABOUT WHAT ADDITIONAL WORK CAN BE DONE. FINE WELL I WOULD LIKE TO COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER THAT. TO SOME DEGREE HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO. LAY DOWN A MARKER. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ROUTE THERE ARE RESULTS. FOR THE INVESTMENT OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TOO OFTEN WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ON THAT. PLEASE. GOOD MORNING ONLY SUMMERS AND GIVE IT A PART IN A PLANE AND SO I RECENTLY IN THE FALL WE'VE STARTED WE RELEASED THE FIRST. RESULTS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE DASHBOARD. AND YOU KNOW IN THE STASHED WHERE IS MEASURING NOW MORE. ADDITIONAL AND SO YOU WE USED TO BE LIKE A REAL HIGH TEST EVERYTHING WAS BASED ON THE TEST SCORES NEED THE DASHBOARD NOW HAS A BETTER RANGE OF OUTCOMES. BUT HOW HOW DO YOU THEN REPORT THAT YOUR DASHBOARD THAT RESULTS TO PUT IT THAT WAY POWER THEY REPORTED. THE DASHBOARD RESULTAR. POSTED ONLINE AND ARE INCLUDED IN EVERYONE'S EL CAP SO THAT THEY ARE THERE ADDRESSING THEM. AT THE END EACH YEAR. IT'S A ONE OF THEM HAS RESULTS THERE'LL NEITHER EXPERT HERE ON YES. PLEASE. JUST GO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO THE NATIONAL RESULTS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC I'M ON THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION'S WEBSITE ON THE DASHBOARD OF. POSTS RESULTS OF BOTH THAT TASK WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSESSMENTS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE IN MATH. IT POST INFORMATION ABOUT THINGS LIKE A SUSPENSIONS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM GRADUATION RATES AND CAREER. AT AND A COLLEGE READINESS. WELL. WOULD YOU. SAVE MYSELF AND MY STAFF A LITTLE. WORK AND. PRESENT THE MOST RECENT DATA TO US SO WE COULD TAKE A LOOK AT IT AS WE PROCEED IN THE. AND HERE. WE CAN GET SOME STATEWIDE DATA FOR YOU AND FOR YOUR STAFF CERTAINLY OKAY. MISS COSTA DO YOU HAVE A THOUGHT ON THAT. I'M JUST THAT I THINK THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT POLICYMAKERS HAVE STRUGGLED WITH FOR DECADES IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT LCF FAST AND THE EL CAP REALLY REPRESENT A PRETTY SEISMIC SHIFT IN HOW WE THOUGHT ABOUT EDUCATION FINANCING. AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT OVERALL STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND HOW WE DEFINE THAT AS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE NOTED. WE MOVED FROM A SYSTEM IN WHICH WE HAD MANY DIFFERENT CATEGORICAL AS FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT STUDENT SUBGROUPS ALLOWANCE AT EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS. WE HAD THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAM AND MANY OTHER TASKS. WE'VE NOW MOVED TO. A STRUCTURE IN WHICH INSTEAD OF IT BEING COMPLIANCE DRIVEN ON THE STATE SIDE IT'S REALLY EMANATING MORE FROM THE LOCALS. ON AND THEY USE THE EL CAP AS WELL AS THE DASHBOARD. AND TO YOUR POINTS TO MEASURE PROGRESS. ON THE HOUSE BROUGHT UP THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND I WOULD KNOW AGAIN AND THAT'S BEEN A PERNICIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE STATE FOR MANY YEARS. EONS THAT EXISTED WHEN WE HAVE THE CATEGORICAL. SYSTEM OF A EDUCATION FINANCE IN A CONTINUOUS AND IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING NOT. ALL OF US NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE MONITOR ON AN ONGOING BASIS. BY POINT IN ALL THIS TO THE COLLEAGUES ON THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE IT IT REQUIRES OUR ATTENTION THAT HAS BEEN LONG STANDING. FOR DECADES. BUT WE NEED TO CONTINUALLY FOCUS ON IT AND TRY TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THIS. DELIBERATION AT LEAST LIKE TO BRING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION. AND ASCERTAIN A LITTLE BIT IF MONEY INVESTED THUS FAR MADE MUCH IMPACT. THAT LASTLY. I HAVE GOT THE OF INQUIRED THAT SHE ISSUE AND YOU SEE. WHAT HAVE THEY DONE? TO SAVE MONEY. TO BE MORE PRUDENT. WITH THE DOLLARS THAT THEY INVEST. I DON'T. EDWARD BACK FROM YOU SEE YET. BUT TIM WHITE AND I MET YESTERDAY MORNING. AND HE HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT WHAT CSU HAD DONE. IN THEIR INSTITUTION. TO IMPROVE DELIVERY. MAKE IT MORE PRUDENT. I WAS VERY PLEASED. THAT HE HAD SPENT SO MUCH ATTENTION. TO THAT ISSUE. I WOULD CALL ON OUR EDUCATORS IN CALIFORNIA TO DO SIMILARLY IN ALL BE ASKING THAT QUESTION HAVE YOU SEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO GLOBAL SAVE THAT QUESTION FOR THE HIGHER AND PORTION OF THE SCHEDULED TO BE FOLLOWING THIS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AND VOICE MY SUPPORT FOR THE ASSEMBLY VERSION ON THE SPECIAL EDUCATION EQUALIZATION. THIS TUNER MILLION DOLLARS WOULD ADDRESS FUNDING. RATES WHICH HAVE BEEN UNEQUAL FOR DECADES. I HAPPEN TO REPRESENT A DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST RATES. PER STUDENTS IN OUR STATE AND I CAN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY STUDENTS AND FRESNO WITH DISABILITIES. SHOULD RECEIVE ANY LESS FUNDING THAN A STUDENT IN ANOTHER DISTRICT. AND WANTS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT'S TAKEN US. SO LONG WHY IS IT TAKING US DECADES TO RESOLVE THIS INEQUITIES. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS THE FOCUS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS REALLY BEEN THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA SO SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS ARE GENERAL ED STUDENTS FIRST SO ANY MONEY THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED BY THE STATE FOR THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AT ONE TIME DISCRETIONARY. GRANTS WHICH ARE YOU KNOW NEARING. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN ANOTHER TWENTY BILLION AND I'LL SEE IF AFTER IS FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AS WELL SO. PUTTING IT IN A UPS POP FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION WHILE IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE AND THE LCF UP IT'S NOT A IF WE PROVIDED MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING IT WOULD SIMPLY MEAN THAT LAST. OKAY FF MONEY WOULD BE FUNDING THOSE STUDENTS. I'M. STRUGGLING TO NOT FEEL LIKE THIS IS A BUREAUCRATIC WAY OF SAYING WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE PROBLEM THOUGH FOR DECADES. AND WANTS TO UNDERSTAND. WE HEARD A DIFFERENCE OF A DOUBLING BETWEEN ONE COUNTY AND ANOTHER COUNTY IN TERMS OF WHAT OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION RATES ARE. AND THE EXPENSES ARE THE SAME. AND SO I'M JUST REALLY TRYING TO PUSH US A LITTLE BIT TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM I KNOW WE FOCUSED ON LC FF. BUT WANTED JUST TO PUT MY MARKER AND TO SAY I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE ASSEMBLY VERSION. FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION AND REALLY HOPE THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD FIND A WAY. TO BE SUPPORTIVE AS WELL. IF I MAY UM TO JUST DOT TELL MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS A THINK. ONE OF OUR PRIMARY GOALS HAS BEEN TO FULLY FUND LCF PFAFF WHICH THANKFULLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO BOTH HOUSES OF ADOPTED THAT AS WELL AND THAT'S BEEN A PRIMARY GOAL. THE ISSUE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION EQUALIZATION IS NOT A NEW ONE EITHER ON IT'S ONE THAT HAS BEEN DEBATED IN THE BUDGET. SEVERAL TIMES AT LEAST DURING MY CAREER. AND SO I THINK IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVEN'T SOUGHT TO ADDRESS IT BUT WE WANTED TO REALLY GET TO FULL FUNDING OF THE BASE AMOUNT FOR DISTRICTS FIRST. ADDITIONALLY AS I TESTIFIED THERE HAVE BEEN SOME GOVERNANCE ISSUES THAT NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION IN THIS NEW WORLD OF ALTHEA FAST AND THE AL CAPP. WE REALLY WANTED TO ALIGN ITSELF AS BETTER WITH THAT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND DEVELOPING THEIR EL CAP. ON ESPECIALLY BASED ON SOME OF THE RESULTS WE SAW FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS THIS PAST FALL. SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT FRANKLY I'M ABOUT THE ASSEMBLIES ON INITIATIVE AROUND ACHIEVEMENT GAP. I APPRECIATE. ARE BOTH THE AGENDA AND IN THE LA ELSE DESCRIPTION THEY. REFER TO AFTER AMERICAN STUDENTS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT GETS US INTO DANGEROUS WATERS ONLY TALK ABOUT PROP TO A NINE BECAUSE I AS AS I UNDERSTAND IT. FROM MY COLLEAGUE FOCUS IS CREATING A SUBGROUP TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS. WHO TODAY AND FOR MANY YEARS HAPPEN TO BE AFTER AMERICAN STUDENTS SO IF WE'RE FOCUSING ON LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS THAT GROUP I'M NOT SURE HOW TOOL NINE? TECHNICALLY COMES INTO PLAY FOR SOMEONE TO ADDRESS THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M JUST COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS AROUND AND THE HEAD SO MAYBE START AGAIN SOME CONTEXT. SO FAR SUBGROUPS STATEWIDE WE HAVE SUBGROUPS BASED ON ETHNICITY WE HAVE SUB GROUP AND BASED ON SUSAN DISABILITIES WE HAVE A SUB GROUP FOR FOSTER YOUTH LOW INCOME CHILDREN. AND. ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND OTHER LANGUAGE IN THE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT AND. TO BE FAIR WE HAVEN'T SEEN ON THE AYE TRAILER BILLING WHICH WAS PROPOSAL YET BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT'S THAT'S AND EXISTENCE RIGHT NOW. AND THAT BILL BASICALLY AND. AT SAYS THAT YOU KNOW THIS THE SUBGROUP IS DEFINED BY. BOTH BEING ONE OF THOSE SUB GROUPS AND AT ELIMINATING ALL THE SUBGROUPS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES. SO WHAT THAT DOES ESSENTIALLY IS THAT ELIMINATES TUNES DISABILITIES BECAUSE THEY RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH IDA. I'M ELIMINATES AND THOSE SUBGROUPS THAT RECEIVES UP MIDDLE CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING. SO. OUR CONCERN IS RUN THE FACT THAT WITH THAT LEAVES HIS STUDENTS UP. SUBGROUPS ARE ONLY BASED ON ETHNICITY. TO THE LAWYER THOSE PERFORMING WOULD BE ONLY BASED ON ETHNICITY SATS WERE CONCERNED THROUGH POP TUNIC GOT IT GOT IT. AND THEN IS THERE A WAY. TECHNICALLY. TO AVOID. THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM COUNSELING NOW THE SUPPORT TO THOSE OTHER GROUPS. WHILE ADDRESSING RESOURCES TO THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS BASED ON THEIR PERFORMANCE ON CASTING IN YOUR DEVELOP DASHBOARD IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT. SO I UNDERSTANDING IS AND AND AGAIN WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ON IT BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE SENATE PROPOSAL. ON DOES. GET AROUND THIS ISSUE BY ESTABLISHING ANOTHER SUBGROUP THAT'S BASED ON AND TASK PERFORMANCE AND I NOTICED THAT HE GOT IT GOT IT. TO THE ALLEY OFF I MAY YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT IT AND I WOULD AGREE BOTH TO THE I'D MINISTRATION AND LA I'LL TALK WITH THIS IS A NEW ISSUE AND THAT'S TRUE. I I WOULD HOPE THAT WE MOVE BEYOND A NOTION OF MONITORING TO REALLY TRY TO ADDRESS THE REALITY. AND WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT THE CURRENT. LAW IS PERFORMING SUBGROUP IS YOUR RIGHT FOR AFTER AMERICAN STUDENTS IT SPANS SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS WHICH IS ALL THE MORE TROUBLING. IN TERMS OF WHY THAT CONTINUES TO BE WHAT IS IT IN OUR. ON SYSTEM THAT IS NOT MEETING THE NEEDS OF THIS GROUP OF CHILDREN. YOU TALK ABOUT THEIR OTHER THINGS THE STATE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS THAT YOU DON'T SUPPORT. EVEN ASSEMBLY OR THE SENATE. PROPOSAL LOTIONS WHAT MIGHT THOSE BE. AND SO TO BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE CONCERNS WE WE HAVE A AT THE LEGAL CHALLENGES WITH THE ASSEMBLY pEXPLICATED BUT TO TALK ABOUT THE THE SENATE APPROACH. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN IS THAT. THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDING TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN A PERSISTENT AN ON GOING. UP PROBLEM IS UNLIKELY SAID MAKE THIS SORT OF IMPACT THAT WE WE DESIRE. BUT SO WE DO THINK THAT ANY. SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS SHOULD JUST AS THE PROBLEM BE ON ONGOING COMMITMENT. THE FIRST OPTIONS THAT THAT SUGGESTS WOULD BE MODIFICATIONS TELL CFF SIMILAR TO WHAT THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSED. I'D AND WE HAVE MANY OPTIONS BESIDES ADDING ADDITIONAL GROUPS TO THE ON DUPLICATED COUNT FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE LC FF INCLUDES CONCENTRATION FUNDING WHICH IS. DESIGNED TO BE TARGETED TOWARDS THE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY WELL TARGETED ATTRACT ABOUT SIX PERCENT OF DISTRICTS RECEIVED THIS FUNDING. IF YOU WERE TO TARGETED MORE SPECIFICALLY TO. JUST THE HIGHEST POVERTY DISTRICTS FOR THE SAME DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU CAN. PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO THEM. ANOTHER EXAMPLE WOULD BE YOU COULD GO TO AND I DUPLICATED COUNT OF STUDENTS WEAR UNDER WHICH STUDENTS TO FOR EXAMPLE. ARE BOTH IN FOSTER CARE AND LOW INCOME WOULD RECEIVE TWICE AS MUCH FUNDING AS A A STUDENT WHO BELONGS TO JUST ONE OF THOSE CREW. AND THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES. I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS MANY OPTIONS BEFORE IT ON IT BUT OUR GENERAL ADVICE WOULD BE BECAUSE THIS IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM. YOU SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SOME ONGOING SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST BRIEFLY I SHARE THE CONCERNS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE. THE ASSEMBLY IS. BOB PROPOSAL BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A A PROBLEM THAT YOU'RE REALLY IT IS. NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND. THE SENATE PROPOSAL I THINK. AND DOES IT IN A WAY THAT IS APPROPRIATE EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT IT'S OUTSIDE OF LCF F. AND I'D REALLY LIKE TO SEE. BECAUSE AS THE LOW POINTS OUT. THIS IS A PERSISTENT PROBLEM AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I THINK OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE A LOT OF KNOW HOW. ON I HAVE HELPING TO SOLVE AND I I'D LIKE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT SO. IT WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THE SENATE PROPOSAL ADOPTED BUT BUT WITH THE PROVISION OF PUTS IT UNDER LC FF. THANK YOU SIMILAR METROPOLIS. LIKE JUST DISCUSSION I'VE BEEN ON THE. SUB TO FOR SIX YEARS DOWN THE ASSEMBLY. AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY SEE THE. DEVELOPMENT AND. OF LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING HAS HAD ON THE EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT WITHIN THE STATE. I THINK OF A COUPLE ITEMS HAVE NOT BEEN DISCUSSION THAT. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN USE MONEY TO INFLUENCE HAD AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT. ONE OF THE. LOW. ISSUES THAT OFTEN COMES WHEN YOU VISIT. SCHOOLS AND TALK TO PARENTS IN THE IN PROFESSIONALS ARE YOU'LL FIND OUT. THE GREATEST IMPACT UPON THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILD AS A PARENT. THE* SECONDARILY BE TO TEACH THE TEACHER. SO WHAT LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING ONLY STARTED THIS IT WAS STE. TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FONT OF KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT OUT OF SACRAMENTO DO YOU CATEGORICAL BUT TO PUT IT DOWN WITH IN THE DISTRICTS. AND UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT. AND FRESNO OR BAKERSFIELD ARE CARLSBAD WHICH I REPRESENT. SO WE PUSHED OF MONEY DOWN THERE BUT WE RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT THERE WAS SOME CONSTERNATION FUNDING FOR THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND ECONOMIC ISSUES AND I THINK THAT THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE PAST. THE FIRST THREE OR FOUR YEARS JUST CHANGE ESPECIALLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EL CAPS. A LOT OF PARENTS WERE INVOLVED. I HAVE A BILL GOING THROUGH REQUIRING THAT THE PARENTS ACTUALLY BE INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AL CAPS OFF MY FIRST STATEMENT MOST PORN EDUCATION IS APPARENT. SO. THE YEAH DEL CAPS FROM OF ALL MEANING GOING WE HAVE CARVED OUT SOME MONEY BEFORE. OFF FOR FOSTER CHILDREN IN THE SPECIAL NEEDS I'VE HAD TAKEN THE TIME TO ATTEND THE NUMBER OF THE SEMINARS. A SPECIAL NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT IS VARIED ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE SOME SCHOOL AND OTHERS. HAVE THESE CONSORTIUM SAY LOOK THEY'RE LOOKING AT REGIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. TO ALLOW LOCAL. AGENCIES FIGURED TO DEAL WITH THE BEST WAY TO DO IS SPECIAL NEEDS. AND SO. I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF A CONTINUING THIS PROCESS LOCAL PATROL FUNDING. I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THE ALL CAPS. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN JUST LISTEN TO PEOPLE TALK THAT. A DASHBOARD IS SOMETHING YOU CAN PULL UP ON YOUR COMPUTER RIGHT NOW AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR DISTRICTS. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. I TO BE ALL ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IT SENATORS USE WHEN THEY VISIT AREAS SAYING HERE'S YOUR DASHBOARD IS JUST WHAT YOU WANT TO BE SAYING AND THERE. IT'S A BEGINNING PROJECT WE'VE ADDED CT IN IT AND SOME OTHER ITEMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND SPECIAL NEEDS. SO THE DASHBOARD IS REALLY THE METRIC OF SUCCESS THAT WE CAN GET THE PARENTS INVOLVED SIDE ASK YOUR WE LOOK AT THAT. MY FINAL POINT IS THIS. BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE WHO WOULD QUESTION CREASE FUNDING FOR LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING. FORMULA BUT WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT. I THINK WE NEED TO DOIT BECAUSE HAVE I SAID IN THE LAST SAID TO MEETING. REGARDLESS OF HOW THE ECONOMY GOES UP OR DOWN. A WE HAVE LEARNED THAT IF YOU. SHORT CHANGE EDUCATION IS JUST NOT. LAS CHILDREN AND. IN A PARTICULAR GRADE PERIOD ACTUALLY HAS A HUGE ECONOMIC IMPACT. AND SO I WOULD MUCH RATHER ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED WORKING. PUBLIC I CAN GET A GOOD JOB. THEN DO PUT IN A PROGRAM. BECAUSE SOMEBODY CAN'T GET A JOB. SO I. CAN TREAT A STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE CONTINUE TO. INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY IN LOCAL TWELVE FUNDING. INVESTMENT AND PARENTS INVOLVED THE EL CAP. AND PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING REALLY THE METRICS OF THE DASHBOARD IS SEEN WITH THE SUCCESS IS GOING ON HERE. AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD GO BACK TO WHERE WE WERE PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS AND THANK THE FONT OF KNOWLEDGE IN SACRAMENTO. TO CARVE OUT MONEY FOR DIFFERENT GROUPS I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR IN IS PLANNED TO GO FORWARD JUST MORE MONEY IN IT. I THINK IT'S CHAVEZ. IF I'M I MEAN JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT AS A POINT OF CONTACTS BOTH HOUSES AND THE GOVERNOR IN THEIR BUDGET PLANS HAVE SIXTY EIGHT MILLION TO CREATE A NEW STATEWIDE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT FROM LOW PERFORMING DISTRICTS. THIS MONEY IS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY DISTRICTS WE KNOW THAT THE FIRST GROUP OF DISTRICTS HAVE ISSUES WITH THEIR SPECIAL ED PERFORMANCE. THERE'S LOTS OF DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ISSUES AND THE SYSTEM CAN IDEALLY BE USED TO ADDRESS THIS PANOPLY OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND AS LONG AS THE LEGISLATURE REMAINS FOCUSED ON PERFORMANCE ISSUES INCLUDING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. IT HAS WAY IS TO I THINK DIRECT MONEY IT'S CITIES PERFORMANCE. I'M PROBLEMS. IF I MAY JUST THAT TELL ON THAT POINT I THINK THE POLICY QUESTION FOR EACH OF US TO GRAPPLE WITH IS IN THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT. WE'RE REALLY FUNDING CAPACITY BUILDING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. ON THE PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU AND CONFERENCE ARE REALLY MONEY DIRECTED MORE TOWARDS DISTRICTS SPECIFICALLY ANYTHING THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LONG BEEN FOCUSED ON TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CANDIDLY MANY DISTRICTS ARE EXPERIENCING SOME OF THE VERY SAME ACHIEVEMENT GAPS SO WE'D LIKE TO BUILD UP OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE STATEWIDE TO MAKE SURE THE ALL DISTRICTS CAN AND TO LEARN FROM THAT TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE. SUBGROUP ISSUES THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING LOCALLY. WELL THANK YOU I DON'T KNOW WHERE ALL STILL TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HOW BEST TO. SHRINK THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP I KNOW IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING ISSUE I KNOW EVERYBODY UP HERE AND WENT DOWN THERE IS AS QUITE CONCERNED ABOUT IT. ON ONE OF THE ISSUES I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN. STRUGGLING WITH THIS YES THE MONEY IS GETTING TO TO DISTRICTS HOW DO WE ASSURE THE MONEY IS ACTUALLY GETTING TO THE SCHOOLS. SO IN FACT IF I COULD HEAR FROM AYE WELL FINANCED TO IN WHICH OF YOUR FEEDBACK AND MAKING SURE THAT. I HOW HOW WE'RE ACTUALLY ENSURING THAT THE MONEY IS GETTING INTO THE CLASSROOM NOT JUST TO THE DISTRICT THAT NEITHER. SO. THERE A LOT OF. ISSUES I'VE BEEN RAISED WITH THIS GENERAL QUESTION OF TRANSPARENCY OVER LC FF EXPENDITURES. I THINK THAT THE SPECIFIC ISSUE THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING OUR SCHOOL LEVEL EXPENDITURES. SO THIS IS THIS IS SOMETHING WE HEAR A LOT FROM THE FIELD JUST TO EXPLAIN THAT. AND THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW THE ACCOUNTABILITY. METHODS THAT WE HAVE FOR ALL SEAFOODS EXPENDITURES ARE EXCLUSIVE TO ARE FOCUSED ON THE DISTRICT LEVEL. I DISTRICTS SUBMIT EL CAPS THAT SAY GENERALLY WHAT ARE THEIR THEIR PLANS FOR EXPANDING THESE FUNDS. FOR DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS OF MANY ADVOCATES IS CLAIMED THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE RELEVANT TO REPORT THIS. AT A SCHOOL LEVEL. THAT'S BEEN AN AREA OF CONTROVERSY I I I BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION. IS OPPOSED TO IT. LEGISLATING OF THE FIELD. THANK YOU. FINANCE. SO A I HESITATE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION OR SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE IN ONE OR TWO SENTENCES BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT THAT THEY'RE A OF SIMPLE ISSUE. I THINK WE'D LIKE TO NOTE A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST THE TRANSITION TO LOCAL CONTROL HAS BEEN ANYTHING BUT SIMPLE. IT'S A VERY BIG LEFT IT'S A HUGE CULTURE SHIFT. ON YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IN SOME WAYS FOR FOR LOCALS IT IT COULD BE EASIER TO SAY WELL WE HAVE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE STATE SAYS SO. BUT NOW THEY HAVE TO SAY WELL WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE IT CELL AND THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF CONVERSATION I HAD WITH YOUR COMMUNITY. I WOULD PIGGYBACK ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD. ALL OF YOU SAY REGARDING AND ENGAGING WITH PARENTS AND COMMUNITIES. I THINK SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO AN EXCELLENT JOB OF REACHING OUT WITH THEIR COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSTANDING. ON WHAT THEY NEED TO SAY AND HOW THEY NEED TO SAY IT WE'VE PROPOSED AND BOTH HOUSES HAVE ADOPTED AND FUNDS TO HELP AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COMMUNITIES BECOME A BETTER ENGAGE WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THEY'RE MAKING THESE DECISIONS THAT WE THINK THAT. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT SCHOOL SITE LEVEL EXPENDITURE REPORTING ON IN THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN PRESENTED TO US. THE WAY THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED HAS. REALLY FOCUSED ON TRACKING INDIVIDUAL DOLLARS TO INDIVIDUAL KIDS. AND WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON SEVERAL LEVELS ONE THAT'S A HUGE A WORKLOAD THE LOCAL LEVEL YOU RATHER SEE THOSE FUNDS IN THAT WORKLOAD GO INTO THE CLASSROOM. I THINK ALSO THERE CAN BE PROBLEMS. THOUGH SOPHOCLES WITH THE IDEA THAT YOU WANT TO TRACK KIDS TO TWO DOLLARS. SO I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS BUT WE THINK THAT THERE'S SORT OF A MIDDLE GROUND. BETWEEN THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDED ON AND WHETHER NOT IT'S HELPFUL. I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WE ALL AGREED THAT THE EL CAP WAS GOING TO BE THIS AMAZING DOCUMENT THAT WAS GONNA. YOU KNOW TELL PARENTS EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW AND HELP THEM PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS. BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT IT'S KIND OF A MIXED BAG. AHMED SO WE KNOW THAT THAT NEEDS TO WORK AS WELL. AND SO I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS I THINK WE JUST DON'T WANNA GO DOWN THE ROAD OF PUTTING A TON OF WORK INTO SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT HAVE. IT MAY NOT PROVIDE THE VALUE THAT WE THINK IT WELL. AND REALLY FOCUSING MORE ON ENSURING THAT THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO FESTER LOCALLY FOR DECADES. THAT WERE MAKING SOME INROADS IN ADDRESSING THOSE. BECAUSE WE CAN PUT ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD THAT WE WANT TO INTO LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT IF IF THERE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT WORKING ON IT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM IN THEIR COUNTIES ARE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM. TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS THAT REALLY ARE ARE DEEPER THAN JUST MONEY. I'M WE'RE REALLY CONCERNED WE WON'T MAKE ANY ANY MOVEMENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. GREAT THANK YOU NOW THAT TO CHALLENGES. THAT. WHAT WE GAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DO SOME OF THEM HAVE BEEN DOING THEM FOR YEARS AND DECADES AND OTHERS? THEY HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT SO I THINK THAT IS HOW I THINK THE CHALLENGE OF OUTLINED WHICH IS A. TO SOME EXTENT A STRUGGLE RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING TOM THE INTO. THE WHOLE MODEL THE WHOLE TWENTY FOR ME THAT WAS SET UP BASED ON THE. ASSUMPTION THAT DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. TO. FUNDING AND HOW. THAT FUNDING FORMULA BOX THEY CAN GET GENUINE FEEDBACK PROCESS JUST TALKING TO ONE OR TWO PEOPLE OR EVEN JUST TALKING TO THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS I THINK. ON THE. IF THERE'S SOME WAY FOR US TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUT. WITHOUT CREATING. LOT MORE BUREAUCRACY I THINK THAT WOULD BE BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I. IDEOLOGY SAUSAGE FOR FOR MY DISTRICT OF SAN FRANCISCO I THINK. THERE'S THEIR THEIR OWN FEELING IS THAT THEY'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR DECADES AND THEY HAVE A SET WAY OF DOING IT. BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO REALLY EVALUATE IS IT ISN'T REALLY THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT IS IT REALLY THE MOST EFFECTIVE. WAY TO DO IT I KNOW AS A PARENT MYSELF HOME I. HAVE NEVER HEARD THE WORDS LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA OR AL CAPP OR. YOU KNOW. FUNDING OR EXETER IMAGES JUST IT'S DOESN'T IT DOESN'T FLOW HASN'T FLOWED BACK TO ME AS A PARENT. SO THAT THAT TO ME IS VERY CONCERNING BECAUSE IF I'M A PARENT AND ONE OF THE MOST ENGAGED CITIES IN OUR STATE. ON HOW I CAN JUST IMAGINE IS A CITY THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LAST ENGAGE IN MIND. AYE WHERE PEOPLE TEND TO SORT OF TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING. THAT I THINK THAT ON WE WE FACE A VERY DAUNTING CHALLENGE THAT IT'S IT'S THE ABSOLUTE LYNCH PIN OF THE. PROMISE OF OUR FUNDING FORMULA SO I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. THINK ABOUT THAT AND I AGREE THAT NECESSARY MONEY IS NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS THE ISSUE BUT. I THINK WHEN WE DID THIS FORMULA WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WE WILL TRY TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME MAKE UP FOR LOST GROUND AND I THINK WE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T WAIT FOR ANOTHER TEN YEAR SO THAT SOME PHD IS FROM SOME UNIVERSITY CAN STUDY THIS. AT THAT POINT MY KIDS WILL HAVE FORTY GRADUATE. SO. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TIME ITS I THINK WE DO HAVE TO AS POLICY MAKERS MAKE THE BEST DECISION WITH THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. HERE TODAY AND I THINK WHAT WE ARE AT KNOWLEDGE IN AND I THINK WITH ALL THAT KNOWLEDGE AROUND THE TABLE ON BOTH SIDES OUT THAT WE DO HAVE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND THAT. SEVEN YEARS OR SIX YEARS INTO THIS. YOU KNOW MISTER CHAVEZ AND I WERE ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE PASSED LCS HALF. ON. SIX YEARS GOING INTO IT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE KIND OF PROGRESS THAT WE. HAVE HOPE I DON'T THINK WE WERE EXPECTING MIRACLES BUT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE HAD WE WERE HOPING TO SEE. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PROGRESS GIVEN THE HUGE INVESTMENT WE'VE MADE. SO ARM AND I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT OURSELVES TO MAYOR IN BE IT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S REALLY. IS IS YOU KNOW REALLY THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO CONTINUE DOWN OR DO WE NEED TO DO SOME MODIFICATION I THINK BOTH HOUSES. HAVE COME UP WITH PROPOSALS TO. AUGMENTED I THINK WE TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT THE ACTORS. ON IT YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY WHICH IS DOING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN EXPECTING A DIFFERENT RESULT SOUTH. ON I KNOW THAT FUNDING FORMULA WAS TING KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT WE WERE PURSUING GAP I THINK WE DO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THIS FUNDING FORMULA STILL IS IN THE INITIAL STAGES WE STILL NEED TO PROVIDE THE FEEDBACK AND WE'RE HEARING FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS THAT. THEY THEY HAVEN'T FELT. SO I THINK THAT IS THE FEEDBACK THAT I BEEN GETTING WHICH IS THAT THEY THEY HAVE A SENIOR SO AGAIN. ON THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS TOUCHING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES ALL OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO. LISTENED TO THAT NOT JUST NOT JUST. BE DEFENSIVE ABOUT THEM NOT JUST DEFEND WHAT WE HAVE DONE THE TO SAY HEY WE TOOK A BIG STEP. NOW WE HAVE TO KEEP. IMPROVING AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WERE I THINK AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY SINK LIKE WE WE TOOK A BIG STEP WE THINK THIS IS STILL THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DOZEN DEPARTMENT. SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AND IT WAS INTERESTING AND AND LISTEN TO YOU ARE BECAUSE THAT AS A PARENT. I HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE ALPHABET SOUP OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ALFIE FF EL CAP BECAUSE I I HEARD IT FROM. MY. SON WHICH LET ME KNOW THAT IT WAS BEING DISCUSSED IN THE CLASSROOM PROBABLY BY TEACHERS AND NOT ALWAYS IN A POSITIVE LIGHT WHICH BIG WHICH KIND OF INFORMED THE WAY WHICH WOULD. COME UP AT HOME. IN ADDITION TO YOU KNOW THE TESTING WHICH SHE. ONE IT POLICYMAKERS TO HEAR HIS PERSPECTIVE ABOUT A REGULAR BASIS ANYWAY I HOPE HOPE FROM. WHO EXACTLY IN THE HE HE AUGUST BEEN THE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ONE OF THEM? I HEAR YOU WINNING WHEN YOU SAY IT'S NOT JUST MONEY I GET THAT. AND YET IN IN ALL AS AS BUDGET COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN ALL DISCUSSIONS AROUND INVESTMENT OF OF. VERY. HARD FOUGHT FOR DELICATE PUBLIC DOLLARS THE THE PUBLIC AS WE ALL ARE LOOKING FOR A RETURN ON THE INVESTMENT ARE LOOKING FOR. TRANSPARENCIES WE CAN TRACK THE DOLLARS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE SOULS YOU KNOW THE FAMOUS QUOTE. AND SO IT'S IT'S DIFFICULT TO SAY IT'S NOT JUST MONEY WHEN YOU THERE'S A GROUP OF ADVOCATES WHO CURRENTLY ARE ARGUING FOR YOU KNOW TWENTY K. BY TWENTY TWENTY. AND YOU WE ALL WILL CAUCUSES TO SIX UP ABOUT OUR PER PUPIL INVESTMENT COMPARED TO OTHER STATES IN CALIFORNIA'S NOW THE FORTY NINTH AT THE. EIGHTY EIGHTH OUT OF FIFTY STATES WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE SALT WHILE WE SAY IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT. THE DOLLARS AND THEN YET. IT SEEMS TO ALSO BE AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S CHALLENGING WHEN WE DON'T HAVE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL. ON TRANSPARENCY FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS WHO WHO FOLLOWED THE GOVERNOR'S VISION AROUND LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING DOWN THIS PATH. BASED ON SOME ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT IT WOULD BE I APPRECIATE IT'S A CULTURE SHIFT BUT I GET I THINK MY CONCERN IS KIDS DON'T GET DO ALL VERSE. AND SO WHILE THIS GROUP OF THE BIG KIDS ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THIS CULTURE SHIFT LITTLE HEADS ARE CONTINUING TO SUFFER. WHILE WE. ART. SEEM SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM THOSE WHO NEED THE MOST HELP AND PERHAPS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT. AND SO I YOU KNOW THERE IS A CONCERN AROUND THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND HOW WE CANNOT. COMFORTABLY SAY AS POLICY MAKERS AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THIS NEW LOVE CONTROL EMPHASIS THAT THE DOLLARS ARE. FOLLOWING THE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN GREATEST NEED I THINKAS A RESULT OF THAT YOU DO GET POLICIES FROM BOTH HOUSES TRYING TO. CREATE. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE TO SUPPORT THE STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING EVERYDAY IN CALIFORNIA PUBLICLY FUNDED SCHOOLS. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR ME. YOU KNOW WE WE CAN DISAGREE ON THE TECHNICALITY WHETHER IT'S LEGAL UNDER PROP TWO ONE NINE OR NOT OR HOW WE DO IT BUT I THINK THAT YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SEE A RESPONSE. FROM THIS BODY ABOUT HOW WE FIX IT IN REAL TIME BECAUSE KIDS DON'T GET TO OVERSEE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT. FOR A SLOW CULTURE SHIFT TO HAPPEN. AND. TOO MANY KIDS NOT BENEFIT. TO THE TUNE THEY CAN IF WE WERE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO THE FORMULA. TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR INVESTMENT. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL MOVE TO ISSUE. TO HELP SORT OF MORE LIKE. I AM I APOLOGIZE YOU'RE RIGHT I APOLOGIZE. SORRY AT NEXT THE MOST A CLOSER TO YOU. MINUTE MISTER CHAIR IT'S BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE TO SERVE ON. SUB ONE FOR THE SENATE SIDE ON EDUCATION. AND. EVERY WEEK WE GET TO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN ITS USE IN A GOOD DEBATE. THE. AB SAYS THIS ALEJO'S SAYS SAYS THAT. AND SO. I AM A MISSING THAT IN THIS ROUND YOU DON'T. SEE A FIFTH COLUMN. IT SAYS SAYS YOU KNOW GOVERNOR ASSEMBLY. SENATE AND THEN THEY'LL YELL AGAIN TO TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL. SO WITH THAT I I JUST WANNA LOOK AT PAGE. TEN ELEVEN WHERE YOU DISCUSS A CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. AND THE ASSEMBLY IS WILLING TO. BUMP THE. GOVERNOR'S SUGGESTION OF TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN SAID WHICH I WITH FURTHER IF YOU ARE. SO FOR THAT ITEM THAT IS ISSUE NUMBER THREE. WOULD YOU MIND HOLDING THAT QUESTION I'LL I'LL LEAVE WITH YOU ON ISSUE THREE FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. YES SIR THAT WOULD UP YOU CAN IF YOU HAVE A PROP IF YOU'VE A BROADER QUESTION FEEL FREE TO OUR HOUSE THAT NOW IF NOT A NEW IDEA THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS JUST THE. AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. PLEASE OUT HOW THE HELL DOES THAT FACTOR INTO. OF THE THE. L. CFF. HOUSE AWAITED. A. I AM GOING TO. ANSWER I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION BUT PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M A IF I'M NOT GETTING QUITE IT LATER ASKING. A SO L. CFF IS FIRST BASED ON A SERIES OF WEIGHTS. BY GRADE SPAN SO THEREFORE GRADE SPANS THAT EACH. GENERATE UNIQUE BASE RATES GENERALLY THE HIGHER GRADES. EARNERS. LARGER WAIT IN THE LOWER GRADES AND THIS. BASE RATE IS GENERATED PER UNIT OF AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE SO. THAT IS TO SAY. NOT ONLY HOW MANY STUDENTS ARE SHOWING UP BUT HOW FREQUENTLY ARE THEY ATTENDING SCHOOL SO WE WE TAKE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE TIMES THOSE BASE RATES AND THAT'S HOW WE. WE CALCULATE BASICALLY ALSO. IN AND ARE WE SEEING IN ATTENDANCE LEVELING. I AND I THINK THE ISSUE MIGHT BEGINNING AT TOTAL ATA AND HOW THE GUARANTEE IS AFFECTED BY EIGHT YES SO WE KNOW THAT I'LL SEE IF I FOR THE PER STUDENT FORMULA. ABA. AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WE HAVE SOME PRELIMINARY DATA K. TWELVE EIGHTY HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS OUR OFFICE IT EXPECTS THAT TO CONTINUE DECLINING. FINANCE HAS A SLIGHT PICKUP IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT'S AN ASSUMPTION IF IT WILL BE WHAT IT WILL BE AND IF IT COMES ON LOWER. THAT THE THING IS ONCE YOU ESTABLISH YOUR SPENDING LEVEL. WHICH IS TYPICALLY LINKED TO YOUR ABA ASSUMPTION YOU EITHER OVER OR UNDER SHOT. SO OUR CONCERN FOR OLD A FEW WEEKS NOW HAS BEEN THAT YOU'RE LIKELY OVER SHOOTING A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE OUR ETA LAST MONTH AS LOWER. SO IF EIGHTY A ARM. IT COMES IN HIGHER. YOU BUILD OUT YOU HAVE A TWO YEAR HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION SO IT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT YOU WILL NOT SEE ANY NEED TO CLIMB IN THE GUARANTEE AND NINETEEN TWENTY. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN EVEN IF ABA IN FACT GOES DOWN BECAUSE THE CONSTITUTION HAS US HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. THE COST OF THAT AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS ALREADY IN YOUR PLANS BECAUSE YOU ASSUME THE SLIGHT TICK UP AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YOU'RE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN GUARANTEE US HIGHER BY LITTLE BIT MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED MILLION AGAIN. NOW HAVING SAID THAT ALL OF YOUR PLANS HAVE CERTIFICATION LANGUAGE NEW CERTIFICATION LANGUAGE THAT IS AN EFFORT TO ALIGN YOUR SPENDING WITH THE ULTIMATE GUARANTEE ONCE YOU KNOW WHAT ABA ACTUALLY US. SO IT COULD VERY WELL BE YOU GET A YEAR FROM NOW AND YOU HAVE SPENT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION MORE THAN THAT GUARANTEE US ESTIMATED AT THAT TIME BECAUSE EIGHTY ACTUALLY CAME IN LOWER. AND THE LANGUAGE BEFORE YOU YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE LANGUAGE BUT THEN FUNDS OF THE LANGUAGES THAT. YOU WOULD EFFECTIVELY SCORE THAT AS. FUNDING INTO AN ACCOUNT. THAT WOULD NOT AFFECT YOUR NINETEEN TWENTY GUARANTEED IT WOULD BE A CREDIT TO A FUTURE YEAR ARE WHEN THE GUARANTEE WAS HIGHER. THIS IS THE SUCH THAT WE HAVEN'T NO LONGER MADE A BIG DEAL ABOUT IT BECAUSE YOU'VE BUILT INTO YOUR PLANS A SORT CUSHION TO PROTECT YOU AGAINST THE BASIS THAT YOU'VE SPENT MORE THAN YOU'VE INTENDED ONCE ALL THE INPUTS ARE LOCKED IN PLACE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING TO CONCLUDE. WITH WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT EIGHTY EIGHT AND SEVEN DISTRICTS STARTING TO LEVEL LOUDER DECLINE. ARE WE BUILDING ENOUGH BY A GOOD INFLATION FACTOR IN ME. LC FF SO THAT OBVIOUSLY COST STILL CONTINUE EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A DECLINE IN ATTENDANCE CORRECT SO WE ARE WE PROTECTING THOSE. ORTON DO WE CREATE. A AT ABILITY TO MANIPULATE. AYE EE. NOT PUTTING STUDENTS ON. EXPULSION FOR A DAY OR TWO BECAUSE IT AFFECTS THEIR ABA AND THEREFORE CERTAIN STUDENTS ARE BEING PUNISHED. JUST FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. LET THE AND SAY WE HAVE NOT HEARD ANY REPORTS OF. GAMING STUDENT DISCIPLINE. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF ITS EIGHTY EIGHTY IMPACTS OF THE GENERAL QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPACT ON SCHOOL FINANCE OF DECLINING EIGHTY A. A IS A GENERAL CONCERN BECAUSE. OVER ALL SOON ATTENDANCE HAS BEEN DECLINING IN THE STATE FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS. MANY SCHOOLS ARE IN THE CASE OF OF. HAVING COHORTS ONE SMALLER THAN I HAD THE PREVIOUS. O. CFF ADDRESSES THIS BY HAVING A TEMPORARY HOLD HOMELESS SO. IF A SCHOOL SEIZE OF ONE YEAR DECLINE IN. AN ATTENDANCE A DOES NOT AFFECT THEIR. ABA IMMEDIATELY THE OTHER. FACTOR AS YOU NOTE IS COST OF LIVING. ATTENDANCE. ó COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THOSE ARE APPLIED TO THE L. CFF RATES. BUT THEY ARE. INTENDED TO HOLD THE PURCHASING POWER OF LC FF CONSTANT SO THEY WOULD NOT. DIRECTLY ADDRESS AND ENROLLMENT DECLINES. AND AND MISTER ANDERSON IS CUTE THANK YOU FOR RESPONSES I'VE I'M JUST CURIOUS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE DO HAVE PRESSURES. WITH CALPERS MCALISTER'S AND SO ARE WE. ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE PRESSURES IN THE LC FF. WELL. MOST OF THE EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS THEIR MAIN TO RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS DO COME OUT OF LCF F.. AS YOU KNOW THOSE. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INCREASING LARGELY BECAUSE THE. RATES ARE INCREASING ALSO BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING SALARIES ON WHICH THOSE RATES ARE APPLIED ARE AND. IF THE QUESTION IS ARE WE EXPLICITLY BUILDING IN INCREASES TO THE LC FF. IN LINE WITH THOSE INCREASES THE ADVANCERS NO I I MEAN GENERALLY IT'S BEEN THE CASE THAT I'LL SEE IF I FUNDING HAS INCREASED. AT A AT A FASTER RATE OVER THE. PAST FEW YEARS THAN RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS HAVE INCREASED IT WILL BE UP TO THE LEGISLATURE DID DECIDE WHETHER. SIMILARLY IN FUTURE YEARS LCF A FUNDING WILL INCREASE AT THE SAME PACE. SO WHY WOULD THAT BE A LEGISLATIVE. RESPONSIBLY WHEN OTHER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RESPOND. I HAD THE LEGISLATURE HAS. DISCRETION OBVIOUSLY OVERHEARD HOW FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATED RIGHT. RIVER WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE WOULD DEBATED AS OPPOSED TO. US TRYING TO TELL THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS. YEAH YOUR YOUR CRACK THAT THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND THAT BUDGET AS. I AS A STAFF MEMBER FOR THE LEGISLATURE I JUST LIKE TO REMIND YOU ALL THAT YOU HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE AS WELL. RIGHT BUT IF I MAY SENATOR MORE LIKE TO YOUR AT YOUR. TO YOUR POINT SO. HIGH LEVEL WITHIN LCF OUT THE ADMINISTRATION. DID PROPOSE A TWO POINT SEVEN ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE BASE FUNDING AMOUNTS AND WE KNOW ACTUALLY IN ONE OF OUR MAY REVISION AND PUBLICATIONS WE ACTUALLY QUOTE THE ALEJO. BUT THAT SINCE ENACTMENT OF THE CAL STIRS FUNDING PLAN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CASTERS AND CALPERS CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS FOR K. TWELVE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ON HAVE INCREASED BY THREE BILLION DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME THE FUNDING FORMULA HAS INCREASED BY SEVENTEEN POINT ONE BILLION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GREAT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. SO WE HAVE A REQUEST FOR THE SENATORS TORETURN TO THE FLOOR. THIS WILL BE A GOOD TIME FOR US TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK. SO WE WILL. WE WILL RECESS UNTIL ONE PM TO ALLOW THE CENTERS TO. GO TO THE FLOOR AND THEN THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS CAN. TAKE CARE OF WHATEVER BUSINESS THEY NEEDED TO CARE SO WE WILL ADJOURN TILL ONE PM THANK YOU WE ARE RECONVENING THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I ASK EVERYBODY TO COME BACK UP LET'S BEGIN AND DIE A PICKUP THAT ISSUE NUMBER TWO ONE TIME FUNDING ALLOCATION. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SLASH COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING. YES RYAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO I'VE PAGE THIRTY OF YOUR AGENDA HAS A TABLE LISTING ALL OF THE ONE TIME SPENDING COMMITMENTS. OF WITHIN THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE THERE IS A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS HEAR SOMEONE GO INTO DETAIL IN AND INTO ANY OF THEM UNLESS. YELLER INTEREST IN DISCUSSING THEM JUST A HIGHLIGHT FIRST OF ALL THAT TOTALS AT THE BOTTOM. AS MY COLLEAGUE NOTED EARLIER. THE TWO HOUSES MEN. NOTABLY LESS THAN THE GOVERNOR AND ONE TIME AND THIS DOES LEAVE YOU WITH US OF ABOUT HER IF THE GUARANTEE WERE TO DROP OR GROW. MORE SLOWLY AND FUTURE YEARS ALSO. THE LARGEST USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS AND ALL THREE PACKAGES IS FOR THESE DISCRETIONARY GRANTS THOSE ARE GIVEN OUT ON A FLAT PER STUDENT BASIS AND CAN BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PERSON COSTA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THE ELSE'S POINTED OUT AGAIN THIS GETS TO SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. IN WHICH WE WOULD PREFER HAVING UTILIZING ONE TIME FUNDING ON LIMITATIONS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY OVERALL IN CASE REVENUES WERE TO DECREASE JUST A COUPLE OF HIGH LEVEL COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE PACKAGES BETWEEN THE HOUSES. THE ONETIME DISCRETIONARY FUNDING OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A MUCH HIGHER AMOUNT HERE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT TO GIVE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ADDRESS THINGS SUCH AS PENSION COSTS WHICH SENATOR MORLOCK RAISED EARLIER IN THE COMMITTEE ON AND TO ALLOW THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY BE OF SPECIFIC CONCERN TO A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I WOULD NOTE ON THE TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAM WE DO SUPPORT THE SENATE VERSION THE ASSEMBLY AUGMENTED. THE PROPOSAL AND THEY RE DIRECT. SOME FUNDS. TO SHIFT THE PROGRAM FOCUS WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAD PROPOSED AS. FOCUSING ON SPECIAL EDUCATION AND THEY BROUGHT IT TO INCLUDE BILINGUAL AND STEM TEACHERS AND IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN WITH SPECIAL EDUCATION OUTCOMES IN THE STATE WE REALLY THINK THAT IT DESERVES THIS AYE AYE FOCUS HERE. PUFF WAR ADDITIONAL TEACHERS. LASTLY BOTH HOUSES DID FUND A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SUMMER FURLOUGH PROGRAM WE WOULD KNOW THAT THERE WAS SIMILAR LEGISLATION THAT THE GOVERNOR VETOED AND SO WE WOULD WANT TO ENSURE THAT ANY SUCH PROPOSAL ADDRESS THOSE VETO CONCERNS. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS BECAUSE THE BACTERIA. COMMITTEE. I'M NOT SEEING ANY QUESTIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE. CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. ARE AND WHAT I WILL DO IS SEND SENATOR MORLOCK IS NOT HERE WE WALL PERHAPS TAKE IT BACK UP WHEN HE RETURNS AS WELL BUT. IF WE COULD START AND THEN WE WILL. MAKE SURE HE GETS TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION. IF YOU'RE TO REPLACE START. YES ISSUE THREE IS. I SCHOOL CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION. THE. AND BOTH PACKAGES INCLUDE A PROPOSAL FOR OF FOR EXPAND ITS ONGOING SUPPORT FOR CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION THE SENATE ADOPTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CREATE A NEW HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM WITH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. A STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A DIFFERENT APPROACH. ESTABLISHING ARE CONTINUING THEIR PROGRAM OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION INCENTIVE GRANTS WHICH ARE ADMINISTERED BY CD AND PROVIDING FOUR HUNDRED MILLION FOR THAT PURPOSE. WHAT WE WILL SAY THAT WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY IS APPROACHING THIS ISSUE WE THINK THAT THE? GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF. HANDLING HIGH SCHOOL CTE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS NOT PROPERLY LEVERAGE THE EXPERIENCE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AND. OVERSEEING IT AND OFFERING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR A HIGH SCHOOL CT PROGRAMS. SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND USING THE ASSEMBLIES APPROACH BUT ADOPTING WHATEVER DOLLAR LEVEL THE LEGISLATURE WAS COMFORTABLE WITH. MISTRUST CONVERSELY THE ADMINISTRATION RATHER THAN LEVERAGING CD HE'S. EXPERTISE IN THIS ISSUE WANTS TO LEVERAGE WHAT'S HAPPENING REGIONALLY SO THE COMMUNE. STRONG WORKFORCE INVESTMENT WE BELIEVE IT MAKES SENSE FOR REGION'S TO HAVE THE. FULL EXPOSURE OF CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION STARTING AT HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. CLEARLY THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS HOME WILL BE DICTATED BY THE TOTAL NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE BUT THE ADMINISTRATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE GOVERNANCE MODEL THAT WE PUT FORWARD. WHICH WOULD CREATE A OUR BROADER REGIONAL APPROACH TO CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION ADDITION LEAN THIS PROGRAM WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY FUNDED WAS OVER THREE YEARS ON AND AS SUCH IT'S REALLY. BEEN STRUCTURED AS REALLY A TEMPORARY PROGRAM SO WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT INCLUDING ONGOING FUNDING IN THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA START WITH SENATOR MORLOCK ONCE HE SETTLES DOWN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I I I I FEEL THE LOVE. ANOTHER BILL THAT. JUST ON ARM. CAREER. TECHNICAL EDUCATION WE'RE SEEING THE ASSEMBLY OFFER. HIGHER NUMBER THAN THEM THE. GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION. AND I JUST WANTED TO KNOW ONE. I GUESS IT'S LIKE TO SAY I AFFIRM THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. AND INTO CAN WE MAKE A HIGHER. WOULD BE THAT THE OF THAT THE THOUGHT I'M JUST WONDERING WERE LA O. MIGHT BE. ON ON THIS ONE SINCE WE'RE NOT GETTING A DEBATE GOING. IT IS SO I AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT THE ASSEMBLIES APPROACH. WHO WE THINK THAT IT? THAT IT IS ANNA APPROPRIATE LEVERAGING OF CD'S EXISTING EXPERTISE IN THESE PROGRAMS TO OPERATE THE PROGRAM UNDER THEIR DIRECTION. AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT WHATEVER APPROPRIATION LEVEL THEY MAY FIND APPROPRIATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR. OTHER QUESTIONS MR TRUST BOB. I MAKE ME THE. GALLAGHER FARTHER INTO THE. ASSEMBLY IS PROGRAM IS SENATE GRANT PROGRAM. WHAT ELEMENTS OF IT DID YOU FIND APPEALING? I IT AGAIN THIS IS LARGELY A QUESTION OF. WHAT ADMINISTRATIVE BODY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM AND WE JUST BELIEVE THAT? BUT. WITH THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF HIGH SCHOOL BASED CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM CD HAS A LONG HISTORY OF ADMINISTERING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS FOR THAT PURPOSE STATE. THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE SCHOOLS SO. THAT HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE WOULD HAVE TO BE REPLICATED IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND IN ORDER FOR THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE THE SAME SUPPORT FOR. SPECIFICALLY CD HAS GONE THROUGH AND ACTS EXERCISE OF MAKING SURE THAT THE CT <u>&lt;c.green&gt; CAREER.&lt;/c&gt;</u> THE CT ACADEMIC STANDARDS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE COMMON CORE STANDARDS SO THESE QUE TALL ACADEMIC CONTENT STANDARDS THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CAREER TRAINING AS A LINE STUCK TO THEM. CD IS ALSO WORKING WITH SOMETHING LIKE SEVEN TO NINE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE TO TRY TO PROVIDE. REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP CTT PROGRAMS LOCALLY IMPROVE THAT ALREADY EXISTS SO WE WOULD SUGGEST WHATEVER YOU DO YOU TRY TO LEVERAGE THAT IN SOME FASHION. AND DOES IT IS A GRANT PROGRAM WHAT WAS THE AMOUNT OF THE. SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR USE IN TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE MATCHING AMOUNT. I'D YES IN PREVIOUS YEARS THE CITY INCENTIVE GRANT WAS FUNDED ON A ONE TIME BASIS WITH A MATCHING GRANT REQUIREMENT THAT. MATCHING. REQUIREMENT. CHANGED INTO YEARS IT IT. STARTED OUT I BELIEVE IT FIFTY FIFTY IN AND DID. AT TWO. LOOK AT WHAT. TWO ONE IS THAT. THE PAY A YAWN I THINK WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING BEYOND ALL CFF WITH CTE AGAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DISPOSED TO DO CTE WITHIN HIGH SCHOOLS ARE THE HOT DASHBOARD MEASURE TO KEEP TRACK OF PERFORMANCE IN THAT AREA. IF YOU'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING SPECIAL WITH CTE THAT LOCAL COMMITMENT WE THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT SO THAT YOU CONTINUE TO BUILD OFF OF THESE THINGS AGAIN THAT HAPPENED HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. BUT THE FINAL POINT HAS OVER THE LAST LIKE EIGHT YEARS THE STATE'S MAIN NOTABLE INVESTMENTS TO TRY TO GET COLLEGES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ARTICULATE THEIR THE STATE HAS. CREATED SEVERAL PROGRAMS THAT TRY TO GET COLLEGES TO SIT DOWN WITH HIGH SCHOOLS TO SAY. LET'S RUN PROGRAMS IN THESE AREAS AND LET'S COME TO HIGH SCHOOLS RUN THE FIRST TWO LEVELS AND COLLEGES THE NEXT THREE LEVELS BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN BE ARTICULATED AND LEAD TO. AN INDUSTRY VALUED SIR TO THE CAT. SO. I THINK THERE'S A WAY AGAIN FOR THE STATE TO LEVERAGE ALL OF THESE EFFORTS THAT IT'S MADE OVER THE LAST. ALMOST DECADE TO IMPROVE CITY IN THE STATE. AND THAT'S WHAT AND THAT'S WHY AM I WANTED YOU TO DISCUSS THAT BECAUSE AND. HAVING BEEN A NUMBER DISCUSSIONS WITH. WHERE WE GOT THE NUMBER FOR? FOR THIS PROGRAM. PARTNERING WITH. WHEN YOU'RE BACK TO OPEN DRAW FUNNY WHEN YOU PARTNER WITH. WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND GET THEM INVOLVED IN EDUCATION. IT JUST MAKES SENSE THAT WE KNOW NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE GOING TO GO TO BERKELEY. THAT SOME CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE GOING INTO CAREERS IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEM. EARLY ENGAGE IN A CAREER PATH. JUNIORS SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS. OUR AND PARTNERING WITH A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT TRADES I VISITED NUMBER THE TRADE UNIONS WHEN YOU TALK TO THE CARPENTERS ELECTRICIANS. PIPETTERS THE SHEET METAL WORKERS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS THEY NEED. AS A YOUNGER WORKFORCE THE DEPEND ON THE AGENTS ARE LOOKING AT. TWENTY FOUR TO TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD INDIVIDUALS GOING INTO THESE CAREERS AND I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM COME IN AND AT AN EARLIER AGE. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM APPRENTICESHIP FELIZ TARGET INVOLVED IN THIS. TO OF TO CONTINUE ON TO BECOME A JOURNEYMAN BY THE AGE OF. TWENTY TO YOU COULD HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE MAY BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND SO. I THINK THIS IS JUST A. GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNNIES DOING RELEVANCY. OF EDUCATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. ALIGNING WITH OUR CORE CURRICULUM. WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING IN THE DASHBOARD TO ADD THIS AS ELEMENT SO IMPACTS LOOK AT IT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU SEE WHAT PERCENT OF THE CHILDREN ARE GOING TO COLLEGE CAREER READ. COLLEGE READY GRADUATING COLLEGE. BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE WHAT PERCENT OF YOUR CHILDREN MAY ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO GO INTO CAREER WHICH I THINK IS A GOOD MEASUREMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT MIDDLE CLASS JOBS AND INCOME EQUITY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE SO. I WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HEAR AN ANSWER TO A SENATOR MORE LAST QUESTION IS THAT THE RIGHT NUMBER. WE ORIGINALLY HAD A PLAN TO HAVE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN TO DO IT. OVER THREE YEARS SO I'D BE CONTINUE INVESTMENT. OF THREE YEAR PERIOD LEO ONE POINT FIVE BILLION AND IF WE DO A MATCH WHATEVER THE RATIO IS. CONCEIVABLY YOU COULD HAVE. TWO TO THREE MILLION BILLION DOLLARS INTO A PROGRAM OVER THREE YEARS WHICH WOULD THEN HAVE LEGS AND LAST. THING BICU HIS GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE SO I'D ASK. OF THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE TO LOOK AT. GOING WITH THIS WE UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW FRENCH LITERATURE MAJORS OUT OF BERKELEY. SOME. SOME MORE I'M SORRY MR JIANG NOT AND WE WANT TO BE SO SUMMER ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WORKING HARD OUT IN THE FIELDS AND WORKING IN THE TRADES WHICH I STRONGLY SUPPORT. GREAT MIDDLE CLASS JOBS SO. IN THE DISCUSSION HAIRLIKE IS AT STAKE WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED THAT SHOULD BE THE FLOOR WE ORIGINALLY REQUESTED FIVE HUNDRED. IF I MAY ON THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE OUT MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WE PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ON THEIR REGIONAL MODEL THEY ALSO HAD A MORE TRADITIONAL MODEL THEY'VE MOVED TO THIS REGIONAL MODEL BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS. MAKING SURE THAT THE PROGRAM OFFERINGS ARE LINES TO THE WORKFORCE NEEDS OF ANY PARTICULAR REGION WE DON'T THINK THAT K. TWELVE SHOULD BE OUTSIDE OF THAT PROCESS AND WE DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING IN OUR PROPOSAL THAT WOULD PRECLUDE THE CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT THAT THE ANALYST HAS SUGGESTED. I'M GONNA SIR NIELSEN EXPLICIT A FOLLOW UP ONE QUICK QUESTION ON THAT POINT. SO I I DID WANT TO NOTE. THE A DISTANT WE HAD SOME CONCERNS. REGARDING THE OUR REQUIREMENT TO HAVE THIS SEVENTY TWO REGIONAL CONSORTIA CREATE A K. TWELVE SELECTION COMMITTEE. TO DISBURSE FUNDS SO COULD YOU ARMY GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON THE I THINK THE CONCERN WAS THAT IT WAS ANOTHER. LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY IN A LOT OF MONEY JUST TO. MOVE MONEY. AMBER ALEXANDER WHAT DEPARTMENT CLARIFICATION ON THAT POINT THERE ARE ONLY EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA SO THERETHIS WOULD BE HAPPENING I MEAN EIGHT REGIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE SEVENTY TWO FIGURE THAT I BELIEVE YOU'RE REFERENCING IS THE SEVENTY TWO WORKFORCE PATHWAY COORDINATORS WHICH WOULD BE KIND OF THE REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS WITH IN THOSE REGIONS. SO BE EIGHT REGIONAL CONSORTIA WOULD EACH THE SET UP EIGHT KATE FOR SELECTION COMMITTEE SO THERE WOULD BE EIGHT SELECTION COMMITTEES. SO YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN THEIR. FICKLE THOUGH REALLY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE ARE LOCALLY DRIVEN DECISIONS AND THAT IS WHY THEY ARE STRUCTURED THAT WAY WITHIN THE EIGHT REGIONS. ON THE SELECTION COMMITTEE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT KEY TWELVE IS REALLY HAVING CONTROL OVER THOSE DECISIONS BECAUSE THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD BE GUIDING AND THE DECISIONS BY MOVING TO THIS MODEL. GREAT THANK YOU DO IN THE COULD YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION BETWEEN THE SEVENTY TWO IN THE. GIVE A ROUGH FISCAL ESTIMATE FOR WHAT THE WHAT THE COST WOULD BE FOR THAT TO ORGANIZATION. THAT SO THAT DOLLAR FIGURE THAT WE'VE PUT FORWARD IN GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WILL REMAINS WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED MILLION. ALLOCATED OUT TO THE CONSORTIUM VIA THE FORMULA THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE REGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THE PROJECTED JOB OPENINGS IN THE SEVEN TO TWELVE EIGHTY A IN THE REGION. AND WE HAVE DONE SOME ROUGH PRODUCTIONS BUT. UNTIL WE KNOW THE THE CONSORTIUM AS ON THE COUNTY LINES IT'LL BE HARD TO GET AN EXACT FIGURE BUT WE WE DO ROUGHLY. GOSH I GOT ABOUT MY MEDICAL FIGHT THE DEED YOU HAVE ASSISTED YOU BUDGET FOR WHAT ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WILL GO TO. CREATE THESE COMMITTEES AND SO WE DID AT AND AS PART OF A MAJOR MISSION AND ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION THAT'S ON TOP OF THE TWO HUNDRED THAT'S PROVIDER FOR GRANDSON NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE CONSORTIUM MINISTRY OF COSTS. GREAT THANK YOU AND ANOTHER OPTION RATHER THAN CREATING AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPARATUS ABOUT THE MONEY THAT DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST AND YOU HAVE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ANAHEIM CD. IS WHETHER IT'S THE STRONG WORK FORCE OR THE SI TIENES SON OF GRANT PROGRAM YOU COULD JUST PUT A REQUIREMENTS THAT BY VIRTUE OF GETTING EITHER OF THESE POTS OF MONEY HIGH SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES YOU NEED TO TALK WITH EACH OTHER AND MAKE SURE THAT YOUR. COURSES ARE LINED. IF I JUST RESPOND TO THAT POINT AND THERE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN THOSE TYPES OF REQUIREMENTS AND PASSED PROGRAMS IN BOTH CAREER PATHWAYS TRUST AND A CT INCENTIVE GRANT. THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS THOSE BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OUTCOMES FROM THOSE PROGRAMS AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND SO BY BRINGING IT TO A REGIONAL LEVEL WE WILL. MEAN SEXUALLY FORCE THAT CONVERSATION TO BE HAPPENING LOCALLY. GREAT THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION SENATOR NIELSEN. ON THAT POINT I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE. THE. SELECTION COMMITTEE COULD BE AND SHOULD BE SCRUTINIZED AS. WHETHER IT WORKS VERY WELL OR NOT. AYE I'M NOT READY TO BUY IN A FULL TIME. BUT I. COULD ACCEPT WERE SET RIGHT NOW I I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT. THAT. COMMUNITY COLLEGES WOULD NOT. THE WE DIRECT MONEY AT THAT THAT WHOLE RESTRUCTURING. GAVE ME SOME CONCERN. AND THE MORE LOCAL. THE BETTER. CAREER TECHS HAD A. KIND OF A TORTURED HISTORY. SEEMS LIKE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. CRITICS WAS VERY VULNERABLE. AND FIVE THOUSAND. BLUE AND GOLD JACKET FUTURE FARMERS MARCHED HERE ON THE CAPITOL. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE. VENDORS CREDIT. THE NEXT YEAR THE GOVERNOR. STRONGLY SUPPORTED CRITIC AT. AND IN FACT HE EXPANDED THE INCENTIVE GRANTS. TO THE OTHER PROGRAMS. IN. NOT JUST TO PROVOKE AG. CAREER TECH MATCH BUT ALSO TO THE REST OF CRITICAL. IS THERE ANY. INCENTIVE GRANT MONEY AS A PART OF THIS PARTICULAR PLAN. I DON'T THINK THERE IS IS THAT RIGHT. THIS PROGRAM IS IF SEPARATE FROM THE C. T. INCENTIVE GRANT PROGRAM SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE EXISTING CITY I THINK GRANT PROGRAM TO SUNSET AND. AND ESTABLISH THIS NEW PROGRAM WITHIN THE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. AND THERE IS I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE AG INCENTIVE GRANTS THAT'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM SEPARATE AND APART FROM CT INCENTIVE GRANT AND WE DO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ONGOING FUNDING FOR THAT. THAT'S THAT'S A SHEPHERD THE. PROVISION IN THE ANTICOAGULANT TIRE. WE GOT A SONG CYCLE. SO YOUR CONCEPT THEN IS WITH THE MONEY STE. DIRECTED HERE MAN. THE LOCALS WILL HAVE ENOUGH ABILITY. THE P. FLEXIBLE. AND THEREFORE WOULD NOT NEED THE INCENTIVE GRANT IS AT THE THE LOGIC. I MEAN THAT'S A SEPARATE DEAL BUT ITS ALSO PART OF THEIR FUNDING STREAM. SO BE AND CTS CENTER OF GRANT. FROM ITS INCEPTION IT WAS IT WAS MESSAGED OUT A SHORT TERM PROGRAM TRIP TO TRANSITION TELLS THE A FAP. AND THE ADMINISTRATION WAS VERY CLEAR IN THAT WE STRUCTURED IT THAT WAY WITH THE. DECREASING STATE COMMITMENT AND THE INCREASING LOCAL MATCH REQUIREMENT. SO. FROM THE GET GO IT WAS ALWAYS ENVISIONED TO BE A THREE YEAR PROGRAM. AT THIS PROGRAM WHILE IT DOES HAVE SOME OF THE SAME ELEMENTS BECAUSE WE DID HERE IN THE FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY CTE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY VALUED IN THE FIELD. WE PULLED A LOT OF THOSE ELEMENTS IN THE DIFFERENCE REALLY IS THAT OUR PROGRAM IS FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON CTV PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO REGIONAL WORKFORCE NEEDS AND FEEDING INDUSTRY DEMAND AN AREA. WELL. I CAN SEE SOME MERIT WITH THAT IN THE PART THE REGIONAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE THE THE LOCAL APPRENTICESHIPS PROGRAMS WHICH WE COULD DIRECT. INDIVIDUALS AND TO. THAT I THINK THAT FIT. I I WOULD ARGUE WHO ALONG WITH CENTER MORE LACK FOR EVEN A HIGHER COMMITMENT TO PROTECT AT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT IN. CALIFORNIA MORE SO NOW THAN BEFORE. AND I BRING ANOTHER ASPECT. CAREER TECH IT. PEOPLE'S ATTENTION. CAREER TECH ED. STUDENTS. DIRECT THEMSELVES AND. TRAINED. CERTIFIED. INTO CAREERS. MANY THAT'S A CAREER TOPPER. IN THE GREAT CAREERS. BUT OTHERS MIGHT WANT TO ASPIRE TO DO MORE WITHIN THAT PARTICULAR CAREER. OR. GO ANOTHER DIRECTION TO IMPROVE THEM SELVES AND THEIR OWN. FUTURE. AT AND NOT YOU MENTIONED A BIT AGO. METRIC ARTICULATE AND MATRICULATE. I HAVE LONG. ADVOCATED. FOR C. S. YOU AND YOU SEE TO EMBRACE. CAREER TECH STUDENTS. TO ENCOURAGE THAT. TO BE AVAILABLE. PROGRAMS THAT CSU YOU SEE WOULD HOLD. FOURTH. TO THE CAREER TECH INDIVIDUAL. WHO HAS GONE TO THEIR CAREER IN THEIR ESTABLISH BUT NOW THEY WANT TO DO MORE? I THINK SHE ISSUE IS A LITTLE BIT INTERESTED IN THAT I DON'T THINK. YOU SEE AS YET. BUT MY POINT IN ALL OF THIS AND THE REASON FOR THAT THE STRONG SUPPORT FOR CAREER TECH ED. I THINK CALIFORNIA AND THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OR FINALLY VIEWING CAREER TECH AT. AS PREMIER AND WORTHY OF SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR. OKAY SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE. NUMBER FOUR. KINDERGARTEN PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL. IN WE HAVE WAS CORTES AND MR CABRAL FROM THAT WE KNOW YOU CAN STE BEGIN A TRUCK. GOOD AFTERNOON SIR CORTES FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IT'S ON PAGE. THIRTY SIX OF YOUR AGENDA ISSUE FOR HAS BOTH HOUSES ACTIONS ON KINDERGARTEN PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. NOW BOTH HOUSES INCLUDE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO IMPLEMENT A MULTI YEAR BUDGET AGREEMENT. THIS INCLUDES ABOUT THREE THOUSAND FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS IN A RATE INCREASE IN A COLA. AND THE ASSEMBLY A PLAN INCLUDES ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATION THOSE NOTED ON PAGE THIRTY SIX. NOW THE FIRST TWO BULLETS ARE RELATED TO KINDERGARTEN. THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FOR INCREASED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN RATE. IT AND ALSO INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION ONE HIGH NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT UP FOR. THE SILLY GRANTS FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. WITH REGARDS TO THE RATE PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT A MAJORITY OF KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS OFFERED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN I'M SICK JUST UNDER WAY IS NOT THE BARRIER FOR. OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. I'M WITH REGARD TO THE FACILITIES PROPOSAL WE THINK THAT THIS COULD HELP PROMOTE A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. AS. AS ELEAZAR REPORT THEIR INTEREST SAID ELEAZAR OFFER PARTY CAN OUR GARDEN REPORT THAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT A BARRIER TO OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN IS A FACILITY CONSTRAINTS. NOW THE PRESCHOOL PROPOSALS ARE THE NEXT FOUR BULLETS ON THIS ON THIS PAGE. THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION FOR ONE TIME ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FIRST A PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES. THEIR SIXTY MILLION FOR ADDITIONAL SLOTS A THAN SIX MILLION FOR ONE TIME ONE TIME GRANTS FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. WITH REGARDS TO THE FACILITY PROPOSAL FOR STATE PRESCHOOL WE'VE HEARD FACILITIES IS A CONSTRAINT FOR STATE PRESCHOOL. EXPANSION. BUT BOTH HOUSES TOOK ACTION ON AN ITEM PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FOR EXPANSION GRANTS THAT THEY COULD SEE PRESCHOOLS COULD USE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WITH REGARDS TO INCREASING SLOTS GIVEN THAT RECENT FLOW INCREASES HAVE GONE NOT FULLY UTILIZED. A WE HAVE CONCERNS AT THE SLOTS WOULD ALSO COULDN'T GO NOT FULLY UTILIZED. AND WITH REGARD TO THE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION OUR CONCERN IS THAT MAJORITY OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE FOR THAT HAS PROPOSED FOR THIS ONE TIME FUNDS. ARE BEING FUNDED WITH. ONGOING RESOURCES. AND THE LAST BULLET ON THIS PAGE IS A RATE INCREASE FOR THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION AND SAFETY PROGRAM WHICH IS SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION. AND THAT CONCLUDESMY REMARKS THAN HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. THIS COST. THANK YOU YES WE SUPPORT THE SENATE'S VERSION OF THIS PARTICULAR ITEM I'D NOTICED A COUPLE OF AND CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE WITH. SOME OF THE ASSEMBLY PROVISIONS. AS NOTED AND THE ASSEMBLY VERSION PROVIDES FIVE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL FULL DAY STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS WE WOULD NOTE THAT TODAY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS IDENTIFIED ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN STATE PRESCHOOL ATTRIBUTED BACK TO THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR. A OUR BELIEF IS THAT THESE ON U. SLOTS REFLECT AT BIGGER ISSUES THAT ARE HAPPENING LOCALLY THAT COULD BE THINGS LIKE. LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR FACILITIES AND WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL THAT WOULD OPEN UP ELIGIBILITY OF STEEP PRESCHOOL TO ALL STUDENTS ATTENDING A TITLE ONE SCHOOL. DON'T ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE CURRENTLY ELIGIBLE CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING SERVED BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE ISSUES I'VE JUST OUTLINED. THIS SIMPLY IS INVESTMENT OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND EACH FOR KINDERGARTEN PRESCHOOL FACILITIES ARE DUPLICATIVE OF OTHER PROGRAMS. IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSED AND BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE ADOPTED ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM WHICH WOULD BUILD CAPACITY FOR PRE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THROUGH ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND LOW ACCESS AREAS OF THE STATE. GETTING BACK TO MY PREVIOUS POINT ABOUT. STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AS WELL. THIS SIMPLY PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR INCENTIVES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO OFFER EXTENDED DAYCARE GUARD AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT NEARLY THREE QUARTERS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALREADY OFFER EXTENDED DAY KINDERGARTEN. AND THOSE THAT DO NOT MAY HAVE OTHER REASONS FOR NOT OFFERING AN EXTENDED DEEP CREEK OUT. EXCUSE ME AN EXTENDED THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM. AND WE WOULD KNOW YOU KNOW WITH THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WOULD PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY IS FOR DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO OFFER SUCH PROGRAMS TO DO SO WITHIN THEIR HEALTH FF FUNDING. LASTLY THE MINISTRATION DOES NOT SUPPORT THE AUGMENTATION OF ACES OR AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION SAFETY PROGRAM FUNDING. STATE ACES FUNDING IS NOT INTENDED TO COVER THE TOTALITY OF THE PROGRAM EXISTING LAW REQUIRES A THIRTY THREE PERCENT LOCAL MATCH OF THE TOTAL CRAP WITHOUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SIR MITCHELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. BUT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS AND AND. THE FACT THAT IT EIGHT YEARS AND WE STILL HAVE SPOTS THAT ARE GOING ON USED. IS ADMINISTRATION ARTISTS LA EL HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WERE INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO ASK WHAT'S THE GOING YOU THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO IT EVERY YEAR. WHAT ELSE SHOULD WE BE DOING TO REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BARRIER IS? IS IT IS IT AN OUTDATED AND I HAVE I DON'T WANT TO STAKEHOLDERS TO. BLOW ME UP ON TWITTER BUCKET BUT IS IT IS IT IS IT A A. FRAMEWORK THAT DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE I I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW I AM NOT INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO FUND. STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THE GOING USE WHEN WHEN WE EXPAND AP SLOTS THEY GET TAKEN UP SO I AM MORE INTERESTED IN PUTTING MONEY INTO SLOTS THAT WILL BE UTILIZED SO WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE PRESCHOOL. THANK YOU SENATOR AJUSCO HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE HAVE ACCESS TO STATE PRESCHOOL. AS YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT IT'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED IT'S CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THAT'S CORRECT AND AND WHEN I SAY THAT I SEE STATE PRESCHOOL WHICH WE KNOW WE ALSO HAVE HEAD START DOLLARS WE KNOW THAT THEIR OTHER LOCAL PROGRAMS AS WELL SO. WE KNOW THAT NOT ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IN THE STATE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE CURRENT STRUCTURE TAXES THOSE SERVICE TO US. WE WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE'S DATA FROM A LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS THAT GIVES US A SENSE OF YOU KNOW WHO'S BEING SERVED AND WHO'S NOT RIGHT. OUR SENSE OF BASED ON THAT INFORMATION AS WELL AS. INFORMATION WE'VE RECEIVED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION BASED ON PAST RFP PROCESSES TO PUT THESE THOUGHTS OUT. ON THEIR VARIETY OF FACTORS ONE OF THE FACTORS AND THAT WE ARE ARM IS MOST CONCERNING TO US IS THAT THERE ARE SOME. AREAS OF THE STATE THAT WOULD LIKE TO DRAW DOWN THESE FUNDS BUT THEY HAVE NOT HISTORICALLY HAD THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THE INFRASTRUCTURE I MEAN NOT JUST FACILITIES. BUT. STAFF TRAINED STAFF. TO SUPPORT A TITLE FIVE REGULATED PROGRAM. SO EXPENSIVE AND COMPLICATED TO DEVELOP. CORRECT IF IT'S FIVE IS NOT YES IS COMPLEX APPROPRIATELY FELL YES AND. YES SO. EAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IS A IN PUTTING IN THE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE REALLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM WE HAVE PRIORITIZED PRIORITIZE LOW ACCESS AREAS OF THE STATE. WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS GO TO WHAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM CALL PRESCHOOL DESERT'S. UP AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE EXIST. SPECIFICALLY IN PLACES LIKE INLAND EMPIRE. IT TO ENSURE THAT YOU WERE BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THERE. SO THAT THE FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO DRAW DOWN AT THESE FUNDS. AND NO LONGER HAVE A NEED FOR THEM AND THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ONLY ONES THAT ACTUALLY CAN COMPETE FOR THOSE FUNDS SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL TARGET YOUR THREE THOUSAND THAT YOU PROVIDE FOR IN THE BUDGET. SO IN OUR CONVERSATIONS THAT PART OF EDUCATION ON HOW WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT THE ONE TIME FUNDS AND. THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE NOT ONLY. TEEP PRESCHOOL SLOT THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO FOLKS WHO ARE NOW OPENING UP AND NEWS NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR KIDS BUT ALSO SOME GENERAL CHILDCARE AS WELL. SO THE IDEA IS THAT YOU WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WERE NOT ONLY. YOU KNOW BUILDING WE'VE THAT ONE TIME FUNDS THE CAPACITY TO SERVE KIDS BUT THEY WERE SAYING AND BY THE WAY WE'RE GONNA PARA WITH SOME ON GOING FUNDS FOR SLOTS SO THAT YOU CAN UTILIZE. THAT INTEREST. I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE AN ADDITIONAL ONE THING THAT WE HAVE RAISES THAT THESE NEW SLOTS HAVE BEEN GOING TO ELEAZAR BECAUSE IT'S A FULL DAY SLOT THAT IS USED ENTIRELY WITH PROPOSITION NINETY MONEY. BUT THERE'S ALSO ELEAZAR AT ALSO OFFERS THE PRESCHOOL BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO USE THE FULL DAY SLOT BECAUSE A FULL DAY SLOT FOR A NON ELEAZAR USE WITH THE COMBINATION OF PROPOSITION NINETY AND ON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT. SO ONE THING THAT WE SAY IS THAT. MAYBE ALL OF STATE PRESCHOOL PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WOULD HELP NINE ELLIE IS ALSO ACCESS SOME OF THE SPENDING. I WOULD SUPPORT THAT. FARM IT WILL MORE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO. THIS BECAUSE HE MADE A COMMENT WITH REGARD TO A SYSTEM IT IT'S NOT YOUR EXPECTATION THAT IT. I DON'T MISQUOTE YOU THAT IF THE FULLY FUNDED BY GENERAL FUND. COULD YOU ELABORATE AND THEN TELL ME WHAT. WHAT OPTIONS YOU THINK THEY HAVE? QUITE SIMPLY CURRENT LAW REQUIRES AS THIRTY THREE PERCENT LOCAL MATCH SAID THE ADMINISTRATION'S VIEWPOINT IS AGAIN. YOU CAN UTILIZE YOUR LCF FAST TO COME UP WITH THAT LOCAL MATCHING COMPONENT. AND THAT WOULD. REQUIRE THAT. THE LOCALS. BUT STEP UP IN FUND THEIR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. GOT IT OKAY. THANK YOU SENATOR MORE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I. ON PAGE THIRTY SIX. I'M JUST TRYING TO CONNECT THE DOTS I THINK I'VE FOUND. POLICE THREE OF THE ASSEMBLY NUMBERS THE ONE FIFTY THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION FIRST. AND THE SEVENTY SIX MILLION BUT I'M I'M NOT FINDING ON THE LA DOES REPORT ON PAGE ELEVEN. THE OTHER NUMBERS FOR THE HUNDRED MILLION. COURT FACILITY GRANTS IN THE SIXTY. MILLION FOR THE ADDITIONAL FIVE THOUSAND THE SIX MILLION. FOR THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION SO I'M JUST WONDERING. IF. YOU TIME ACROSS FOOTER IFI MADE THE FUNDING SOURCES ARE DIFFERENT THOSE ARE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS VERSUS WHAT'S IN THE NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. SO DO I HAVE ANY ANYTHING AT ALL TO LOOK AT THAT WOULD MATCH UP WITH THE. THE ISSUE FOR PRINT OUT. WHERE DO I GO GOT THE ORIGINAL BUDGET? PROVISION DO I HAVE DROPPED TO LOOK THERE ARE I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT PAGE NINETEEN. I MIGHT BE ON. THEY LITTLE EASIER TO. SEE SOME OF THE DETAIL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ALL DIG INTO THAT. THANK YOU. MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH RESPECT TO THE ISSUE OF FIRE PRESCHOOL SLOTS THAT ARE NOT. FULLY BEING UTILIZED I THINK. IT'S BROADLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY OUR BUDGETING AND A POLICY MAKING. JUST HOW IMPORTANT. OF A PRESCHOOL IS. AND NOT A CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND. IT IT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE DON'T. FULLY HAVE A GRASP ON WHAT THE GAPS ARE AND TO. HOW WE CAN BEST SPEND THE THE RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE SO I AM WONDERING WHY WE'RE NOT TARGETING SOME MONEY AT IT? LOOKING DEEPER INTO THAT AND DEVELOPING A MORE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT WE CAN PUT INTO EFFECT. THAT WAS BLOOM CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU I'M. FIVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WILL FIRST ON THIS ISSUE OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL. SLOTS AND IF IF WE WERE AT THE POINT THAT WE COULD FULLY FUND. THE STATE PRESCHOOL. PLACEMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE STUDENT IN CALIFORNIA. AT THE HOURS THAT FAMILIES NEED. THEN I THINK THIS WOULD BE THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR US TO GO IN BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT YEAR. SCHEMES ME SENATE BUDGET YOUR NOTED. IS THAT THAT WHILE. WELL I THINK ALL OF US VALUE. THE THAT NOT ONLY THE ROLE OF STATE PRESCHOOL BUT. ITS OFFERINGS. IT'S NOW NOT. IT'S NOT EVERYWHERE. IT'S NOT AN ADEQUATE HOURS. AND SO FAMILIES ARE NOT UTILIZING IT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE PROVIDED IT ADDITIONAL FUNDING. SO. IN THIS INTERIM I THINK WE NEED TO. STEP BACK FROM THAT PERHAPS GET YOU KNOW ASSIST THAT MISTER BLOOM IS REQUESTED. BRITTANY BUT IN THIS INTERIM RATHER THAN TRYING TO DIRECT MORE MONEY TO STAY PRESCHOOL BEFORE WE FULLY FIGURED OUT. HOW TO ADEQUATELY TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S? THE SLOTS ARE GETTING TAKEN UP IN PROVIDING FOR ENOUGH KIDS. WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR THE KIDS IN THE WAYS THAT WE KNOW. THERE UTILIZING WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE WHAT WILL DISCUSS IN ITEM FIVE. SO. THAT'S WHERE I AM MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS SENATE'S APPROACH. ON THE STATE PRESCHOOL SIDE. NOW I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER QUESTIONS THOUGH THAT ARE ON OTHER ITEMS OF THIS FIRST. IT'S REFLECTED IN OUR MATERIALS THAT. A LARGE NUMBER OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOW OFFERING FULL TIME. FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT IT ALSO INDICATES THAT THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. MIGHT NOT BUT THE. THE THE WAY THE MATERIALS ARE PRESENTED IS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO. TO EITHER PROVIDE MORE FUNDING OR PUSH FOR THE FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE. BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S SORT OF ASSUMPTION IS LIKE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S BEING PROVIDED. WHAT I WANT TO GET IS SOME OF THE DATA ON WHAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS AREN'T BECAUSE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT IT'S TENCH LEAVE THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT MOST NEED FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN? ME NEITHER THE FAMILIES THAT MAY NOT BE PROVIDING IT BECAUSE OF OTHER RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. AND. IN SO THAT'S. BEFORE I CAN ACCEPT THAT WE DON'T NEED TO EXTEND THIS JUST BECAUSE TWENTY PERCENT OF DISTRICTS MAY NOT. BE ARE THE ONLY ONES NOT I'D LIKE TO KNOW. TO GET SOME DATA ON WHAT ARE THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T. THEN FINALLY ON THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. THE INFORMATION I'VE BEEN RECEIVING IT MIGHT THIS IN MY OFFICE IS THAT. BETWEEN COST OF LIVING INCREASES AND OF COURSE THE LEGITIMATE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES NOT ONLY THAT THE STATE HAS APPROVED BUT SOME OF OUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE APPROVED. THAT ARE ON A FASTER TIME SKILLED IN THE STATE'S. HAVE PUT ALL MANY OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS NEW POSITION WHERE THEY CAN'T KEEP UP. AND WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THERE'S POTENTIALLY UP TO A THIRD OF THE OF OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. THAT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE. DOT THE CURRENT RATES. AND I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT JUST LIKE. PRESCHOOL THAT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. BECAUSE OUR OUR. NORMAL OUR FIRST SECOND THIRD GRADE THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE ALL DAY BUT THEY'RE NOT A FULL WORKING DAY THEY'RE NOT A FAMILIES WORKING DAY AND SO OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS VERY MUCH. MAKE UP FOR THAT. IN ADDITION TO ADDING IN RICHMOND SUCH. SO I. I AM INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING BETTER. THE THIS GAP FOR THAT OUR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE. DESCRIBING AND ALSO POTENTIALLY. IN THE IN THE LANDING ON IT WHATEVER WE LAND ON ULTIMATELY IN THIS BUDGET. MAKING SURE THAT THOSE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS CAN'T. KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN. MISTRUST. THANK YOU I'D JUST LIKE TO. STATE MY SUPPORT OF WHAT WE JUST WE JUST HEARD FROM THE SENATOR. I THINK SHE'S EXACTLY RIGHT TERM WE KNOW ALL THOSE SLOTS ARE BEING USED AND THAT'S WHY. IT'S ONE BUDGET ITEM UNDERNEATH THE ASSEMBLY SAYS SIX MONEY ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR COUNTY HOUSE EDUCATION IS IS DISTRICTS AND EXPANDING THE PROGRAM TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM IS SO WE CAN MEET THE NEEDS OF IT. I WOULD JUST ALSO LIKE ADDED ANOTHER ITEM I NOTICED EARLIER ON THE ON OUR LIST YEAR. IS A HUNDRED BILLION ONE TIME NON PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR FOR SILLY GRANTS FOR SCHOOL BASED. YOU KNOW I TALKED TO MY SUPERINTENDENTS LOT OF THEM ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN GOING IN THIS DIRECTION. BECAUSE WE HAVE REALLY BURDEN THEM SIGNIFICANTLY. WELL LOCAL FUNDING IN ALL CAPS IN CT <u>&lt;c.green&gt; AND EVERYTHING ELSE.&lt;/c&gt;</u> YOU KNOW COMMON CORE IN OUR SAY NO GO DO THIS TOO. AND SO THEY'RE SAYING WELL YOU KNOW. THAT'S RIGHT. SO WHEN I VISIT. AND I WANNA MAKE. THE POINT HERE. QUALITY. QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT ONCE HE CHILDREN WAREHOUSE BECAUSE I FOCUS A LOT OF IT TO HAVE A CITY. THIS DATA IN OCEANSIDE TO CITIES THAT HAVE LARGE LATINO POPULATIONS. AND. THE EARLY A. PRE PRESCHOOL A CAN OF OUR VOTERS ARE NEARLY AS. GOOD AS SOME OF MY MORE FLUENT AREAS LIKE IN SEASON CARLSBAD AND I SEE THESE YOUNG CHILDREN BE AND. AND THIS IS A ROCKY TERMS ON A STRIP. THEY'RE BEING WAREHOUSED YOU KNOW JUST THERE'S BEEN PUT IN THERE AND NOT GIVING THE FULL EARLY COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS BACK YOUNG CHILDREN WE SAVE. SO. I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THESE. NON LA A PRESCHOOLS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM. OUR NYACK ACCREDITED. THEY'RE VERY HIGH PERFORMING I'VE MADE THIS STATEMENT BEFORE IN THE MILITARY. WE HAVE VERY GOOD PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS BECAUSEWE RECOGNIZE OF BOTH PARENTS ARE PROBABLY WORKING PARENTS ARE DEPLOYED. OTHER STRESSES GOING ON INTO FAMILIES BECAUSE OF. COMBAT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT KIDS GO THROUGH. BUT DOES CHILDREN ARE THE HIGHEST PERFORMANCE SCHOOL DIST SCHOOLS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. BECAUSE OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENT COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR CHILDREN AND SUPPORTERS STRUCTURES. THAT'S WHY THOSE ARE SO IMPORTANT. AND I JUST LIKED ALSO STE AS MAKE A STATEMENT THAT THE. MONEY TO ASSEMBLY PUT IN HERE FOR AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION SAFETY PROGRAMS. IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT I WAS HONORED LAST WEEK TO. RECOGNIZE A YOUNG LADY WHO WAS AT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. PARTNERS OSHITA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM. SHE WON THE. THE US STATE PROGRAM FOR A SPEECH. IS GOING OUT TO THE NATIONALS. THERE ARE GREAT THINGS HAPPEN IN THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHEN. THESE. OTHER ORGANIZATIONS LIKE YMCA BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB WHATEVER OUR WORKLOADS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ENSURE OUR KIDS ARE TAKING CARE PLUS YOU GET THE COLOR BECAUSE. SALLY SO MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW WE HAVE BODY GOES IN THE OF GANGS AND THEY DO THINGS THAT WERE NOT VERY HAPPY WITH. BUT THIS IS A SAFE PLACE WHERE KIDS CAN GO AND BE TAKEN CARE OF IT PARENTS HAVE GOOD SENSE SO. I'D ASK YOU TO LOOK AT THE AFTER SCHOOL EDUCATION. UNDERSTAND THAT WE PUT MONEY SIX MILLION TO LOOK AT WHAT THE REAL NEEDS. AND AND IF WE DO GO THIS WAY. NOT JUST SCHOOL BASE BUT ALSO NON. BELLY A PRESCHOOL. COMMENTS. THANK YOU ARE. MR ABDULLAH. THANK YOU. SOMETIMES I LOOK AROUND AND REALIZE I'M MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS PRE SCHOOL AGED KIDS WHOSE HERE ON CONFERENCE COMMITTEE AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY I WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. HERE TODAY BUT. HAVING A TO FIVE AND SIX YEAR OLD AND SEEING THE LIGHT SWITCH THAT TURNS ON INSIDE OF HIM THAT HAPPENS WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE ASSEMBLY IS SO INTERESTED IN FUNDING THIS PROGRAM. I GUESS I'M A BIT FRUSTRATED TO HEAR THAT THERE IS A HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION AND I'M USE SLOTS FROM SIXTEEN. SEVENTEEN AND WITH THE REGIONAL VARIATIONS THAT WE SEE. I'M WONDERING IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS ANY INSIGHTS ON HOW TO ADDRESS THOSE. REGIONAL VARIATIONS AND TO ENSURE THAT WERE TURNING ON MORE LIGHT SWITCHES FOR CALIFORNIANS ACROSS OUR. THANK YOU. SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER. WE'VE PROPOSED HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE TIME INFRASTRUCTURE. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING UP NEW SLOTS FOR STATE PRESCHOOL AT REALLY IT'S FOR ANY AND AT PROGRAMS IT FOR CHILDREN FOR WHO ARE ZERO THREE FIVE. SMALLER THE EDUCATION WE THINK THAT'S A GOOD START. AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO IN TERMS OF INCREASING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WITH THOSE FUNDS. ARE WE ADDRESSING THE REGIONAL VARIATIONS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED AMONGST THE. INLAND EMPIRE I'M SURE WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE DESERT'S WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AND JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE FUNDS ARE BEING DIRECTED WHERE WE HAVE THE GREATEST. THE PRIORITY AND THAT'S PROVIDED IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THAT PROGRAM DOES PRIORITIZE WHAT WE WOULD CALL LOW ACCESS AREAS. AND DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT EDUCATION TO LOOK AT DATA THAT'S COLLECTED BY LOCAL CONTROL A SITE LOCAL PLANNING COUNCILS. WHICH THAT HAVE THIS DATA I'M TO ENSURE THAT THE DOLLARS ARE PRIORITIZED TOWARDS THOSE LORAX LISTENERS. I'M AT MY LAST TWO CENTS HERE BUT RURAL CALIFORNIA TENDS TO GET FORGOTTEN IN THESE DISCUSSIONS AND. MY HOPE. WE CAN MAKE SURE THEIR VOICES ARE HEARD HERE TO. THINK. THANK YOU ON I I DID WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SENATOR SCARES POINT AROUND A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. WHO ARE CURRENTLY AND WE FUND FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN IS NOT CORRECT? I MEAN I I'M SORRY. I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE FUNDED. I. DON'T NO MY QUESTION IS IS. DOES EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT. WHETHER THEY OFFER FULL DAY OR HALF DAY KINDERGARTEN GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY PER STUDENT THAT'S. SO EVERY DISTRICT REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY HOURS THEY'RE BEING OFFERED IS BEING PAID THE SAME. THAT'S CORRECT. ON SO FOR TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE DISTRICTS. THEY HAVE CHOSEN TO TAKE THE MONEY FOR FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT NOT OFFER FULL TO CAN CARD IS THAT CORRECT. IF THAT'S SO I GUESS MIKE MY QUESTION IS IS ON. GIVEN THE SITUATION THE HOUSES BOTH DELEO AND FINANCIAL BE. CUT THOSE DISTRICTS THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT OFFER AREN'T OFFERING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. OR DO WE NEED TO DO SOME AUGMENTATION SO THAT THEY CAN OFFER FOLLICULAR. AND SO WE DID. RIGHT. SMALL REPORT ON THIS ISSUE. IN FEBRUARY THEY QUESTION BEING WHAT ARE THE COST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FULL THEN PARTY PROGRAMS WE FOUND. ACTUALLY RATHER SURPRISINGLY THAT THERE AREN'T THAT SIGNIFICANT COST DIFFERENCES THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE SURPRISING BUT IF YOU'D BREAK DOWN WHATARE THE COST ELEMENTS IN A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM. A LOT OF THEM ARE THINGS LIKE. CLASSROOM SPACE MATERIALS ADMINISTRATION WHICH ARE ARE ALREADY SPREAD ACROSS A NUMBER OF CHILDREN. OFTENTIMES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS ON A PER CHILD BASIS. THEY'RE NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COST IS THE COST OF THE TEAM SALARY. SO YOU'D SAY THEORETICALLY. PART DAY PROGRAM COULD BE SAVING A LOT OF MONEY IF IT WERE I'M PAYING ITS PARTY TEACHERS LESS IF IT WAS EMPLOYING THEM. ON A PART TIME BASIS OR IF THEIR PARTY TEACHERS WERE TEACHING TWO CLASSES PER DAY HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THE FIRST TWO OPTIONS ARE EXCEEDINGLY RARE IT IT'S RARE FOR TEACHERS TO BE EMPLOYED ON A PART TIME BASIS OR TO BE PAID BLESSED. IF THE INSTRUCTOR PARTLY BECAUSE FROM AND IT'S ACTUALLY AGAINST STATE LAW TERRIERS FINE HAVING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN. SO CD WAS CONTRACTED TO DO A STUDY OF EXACTLY THAT QUESTION IN THEIR SURVEY. RESPONSES INDICATED THAT AMONG. DISTRICTS ARE CURRENTLY ONLY OFFERING PARTY PROGRAM MOST OF THEM ARE INTERESTED IN OFFERING A FULL DAY PROGRAM. OF BUT MOST CITE A LACK OF FACILITY SPACES THEIR PRIMARY BARRIER. SO BASED ON THAT CD STUDY THEY FOUND THAT. THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OR SO ROUGH PREFER PERCENT OF. SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. DON'T OFFER FULLY CONCURRENT THEY WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IF THEY HAD. SOME SUPPORTING TO BUILD OUT FACILITIES SO HE WAS A LACK OF CROSS. THAT'S CORRECT. FINANCE. AND WE BELIEVE THE ANALYST HAS. ACCURATELY IDENTIFIED AND SOME ISSUES AROUND FULL DAY. OKAY SO. WOULD YOU. DO THINK WE BETTER OFF OFFERING MONEY FOR FACILITIES TO GET THE FULL DAY OR SHOULD WE. CUT THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT DOES IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR THAT WE'RE GIVING. DISTRICTS MONEY. AND THAT THEY'RE NOT OFFERING THAT SERVICE. I THINK THE ELSES RAISED A GOOD POINT WITCHES. AND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS PEOPLE ARE THE COST AND EVEN FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHO ARE NOT OFFERING A FULL DAY THEIR COST STRUCTURE IS REALLY NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. I THINK YOU'LL SEE THAT WE HAVE A SIMILAR APPROACH TO BOTH PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN WHICH. THESE AREAS THAT THE STATE WORD THESE ARE BEING OFFERED THERE ARE. INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES SOMETIMES REAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES LIKE FACILITIES OTHER TIMES IT STAFFING. BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE REDUCING THE THE FUNDING AMOUNT WOULD HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT. THE DISTANCE LIKE THIS THERE'S UNIVERSAL AGREEMENT THAT ACTUALLY. PROVIDING INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORT MIGHT. BAGHDAD AND THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. YES. THANK YOU. SERVICE CLERK. THANK YOU. THE. CONFERENCE CHAIR FOR TAG FURTHER ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WAS. LESS. SPECIFIC IN MY COMMENTS ENACT ITS IT. DOZEN OUR MATERIALS POINT OUT THAT THE. BELIAU IS REYES THAT. THE. THAT THEY FEEL THAT THE RATE DIFFERENTIAL. THE LACK OF A RATE DIFFERENTIAL WAS NOT INCENTIVIZING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE PARDEE OVER FULL DAY. AND THAT'S THE ADDING A HIGHER RATE ACROSS THE BOARD WOULD SIMPLY JUST PROVIDED VOTE MORE FUNDING TO PART OR RATHER. FIND MORE THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY PROVIDING IT IN DOES. I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS WIRED TWENTY PERCENT ART BUT I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE IS WISER TWENTY PERCENT NOT. AND WHAT ARE THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHAT'S THE YOU KNOW JUST KNOWING TWENTY PERCENT. DON'T DOESN'T GIVE US ENOUGH INFORMATION. KNOWING WHAT. THE DISTRICTS IS GOING TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ARE THEY. ARE DISTRICTS WOULD THAT ARE. YOU KNOW HAVE THE HIGHEST. PERCENT OF. SPECIAL ED KIDS AND SO THAT'S THE HAVE OTHER FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS ON THEM OR YOU KNOW WHAT'S THESE THIS PROFILE. AND. BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE US TO THE GET TO THE POINT WHERE ALL OF ARE DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BUT I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BUT. COMPLICATE OUR FUNDING ACROSS THE BOARD IF WE ARE YOU HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE. BUT DO YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT IT IS THAT WE NEED TO DO TO GET THEM ALL TO SO. APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WITHIN THE NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE FACILITY INVESTMENTS ARE GREAT USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS BECAUSE THEY REALLY ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE. AND AND I WOULD OFFER THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE. BACK TO THE LA ALL I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT WHY FACILITIES WOULD BE THE LIMITING FACTOR ON FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN BECAUSE YOU WOULD THINK THAT IF YOU'RE ALREADY OFFERING. PARDEE KINDERGARTEN YOU'VE GOT THE CLASSROOM THERE WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE ISSUES A PASSING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT I. KNOW THAT TO EXPLICATE THE ISSUE OF LAMAR. IT WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IN A DISTRICT THAT OFFERS A PARTY PROGRAM IS THAT IN A SINGLE CLASSROOM THERE WILL BE A MORNING KINDERGARTEN CLASS AND. AFTERNOON CLASS SO THEY IF THAT DISTRICT WOULD DO TRANSITION TO A FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN THEY WOULD NEED TWICE AS. CLASSES. THANK YOU. LOOK. AT AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THERE ARE SPECIFIC BUILDING CODE STANDARDS FOR KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOMS SAID THAT THE OTHER CONSTRAINING FACTOR. THANK YOU THANK YOU COLONEL. IT ENDED JUST A A NOTE ON THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL DON'T HAVE OBVIOUSLY ARE SPEAKER. UP TOGETHER BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION ARE WE GOT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK ESPECIALLY FROM. IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE HARD TO SERVE AREAS BECAUSE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND IN OUR OUR PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY AROUND INFRASTRUCTURE WAS REALLY DRIVEN. TO I'LL TRY TO CREATE INCENTIVES FOR GREATER STATE PRESCHOOL PARTICIPATION AS WELL SO I WOULD JUST MAKE THAT NOTE. SENATE MORE LUCK. THANK YOU MISTER AT THANKS FOR REFER ME AGE NINETEEN I'M STILL NOT ABLE TO TIE IN SOME NUMBERS. I'M JUST WONDERING. IF FIVE. MAYBE BEFORE WE VOTE I CAN GET SOME BETTER. INFORMATION SO I COULD CAN ACROSS BUT JUST TO. MAYBE IF THE LA OKAY KINDA GILMORE DETAILER WHOEVER PREPARED THE. ISSUE REPORTS THAT. WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF WE GET IT DONE WHATEVER YOU MAY THINK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. SO NIELSEN. THE. THE PRE KINDERGARTEN. ISSUE. HOW MANY NOW OUR ROLE IN IN THE PRE KINDERGARTEN? OTHER MANY. STUDENTS. SORRY I AM IF YOU DON'T MIND I CAN AND TAKE THAT. ELEMENT SO DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY PRE KINDERGARTEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT SERVE CHILDREN PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN ONE THIS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN I BELIEVE ARE THE MOST RECENT ESTIMATES SHOW THAT AT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. ETA IS SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND. WE ALSO HAVE STATE PRESCHOOL. AND WE FUND STATE PRESCRIBE LEVER ON HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CHILDREN ON I BELIEVE ACTUAL ATTENDANCE IS A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO A HUNDRED THOUSAND. THERE'S ALSO HEAD START AS A FEDERAL PROGRAM. AND THEY'RE NOT GREAT RECENT NUMBERS ON THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE SERVED AT OUR OF PRESCHOOL AGE IN HEAD START. BUT IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN THE REALM OF ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND. AND THE ONE THING THAT WE CAN'T TELL IS TO WHAT EXTENT THERE IS OVERLAP. BETWEEN CHILDREN WHO BENEFIT FROM MULTIPLE PROGRAMS WE KNOW THAT I'M A CHILD WHO'S AT THAT IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. CAN'T GENERATE FUNDING FOR ANOTHER PROGRAM HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT I MANY PROVIDERS WILL BLEND TOGETHER HEAD START AND STATE PRESCHOOL FUNDS. TO PROVIDE A FULL DAY OF CARE FOR A CHILD. AS WELL AS STATE PRESCHOOL WITH OTHER CHILD CARE PROGRAMS. SO IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US NORTH THE OVERLAP IS BUT AT THOSE ARE GENERALLY SPEAKING THE NUMBERS THAT I I KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT LEO HAS ANYMORE. AND SPECIFICS. A A YOU DON'T COME IT DELEO. NO NOT AT THIS TIME OKAY THAT'S ALMOST JIM. THANK YOU. SEE NO. FURTHER COMMENTS WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. CHILDCARE. YEAH. ISSUE FIVE. AIRPORT HAS WITH LA O. SO I'M ISSUE FIVE START ON PAGE THIRTY EIGHT OF YOUR AGENDA AND IT BEGINS A DISCUSSION ON BOTH HOUSES PLANS FOR CHILD CARE SPENDING. NOW BOTH HOUSES PLANS INCLUDE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AUGMENTATIONS I'M IN THIS AREA BUT ALSO MAKE A SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATIONS IN BOTH GENERAL AND FEDERAL FUNDS. THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES IS THE SENATE INCLUDES IN THEIR PLAN TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION OF RECENTLY ALLOCATED OR NEW FEDERAL FUNDS. IN THE ASSEMBLY'S OR WE JUMP INTO THE DIFFERENCES OF EACH HOUSES PLAN FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS. I WOULD NOTE YOU KNOW TWO THINGS IN THE FIRST IS THAT THE STATE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL LAW GOVERNING CHILDCARE. WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE A PLAN ON OR A COST ESTIMATE ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET IN COMPLIANCE. AND THE SECOND IS THERE'S NOT CLARITY OF THESE NEW FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ONE TIME OR ONGOING WE LIKELY WON'T HAVE CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. OF THE NEW FEDERAL FUNDS BOTH HOUSES SPEND THE SAME AMOUNT ON CHILDCARE SLOTS. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BEFORE YOU IS AT THE SENATE ALLOCATES A HUNDRED MORE MILLION TO CD SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT COULD GET IN COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ADDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. THE STATE CURRENTLY HAS WAIVERS FOR SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS WHICH ARE SET TO EXPIRE OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. THE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE SENATE PLAN CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; WILL&lt;/c&gt;</u> SUBMIT A PLAN ON HOW THEY WILL SPEND THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEN WITH SUBMITTED TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BY BUDGET COMMITTEE. THE REMAINING FUNDS OF THIS ONE HUNDRED MILLION NOT USE FOR COMPLIANCE WOULD BE USED FOR NEW SLOTS. SO THE SENATE ALSO USES NEW FEDERAL FUNDS TO MEET THE REQUIRED MINIMUM QUALITY SPENDING LEVEL. AND WITH REGARDS TO THE ASSEMBLY PLAN THEIR PLAN ALLOCATES FEDERAL FUNDS FOR SLOTS THE SAME LEVEL AS THE SENATE PLAN. AND THEY ALSO SPEND ON THESE FEDERAL FUNDS ON A VARIETY OF ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS TARGETED AT IMPROVING QUALITY OF PROGRAMS. IN THE ASSEMBLY PLAN LEAVES A HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION OF THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND SPENT. WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE SENATE'S PLAN BECAUSE WE THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO SET ASIDE FUNDING FOR COMPLIANCE. WE WOULD RECOMMEND A MOCK A MODIFICATION TO THE SENATE PLAN INSTEAD OF THE RIVER REMAINDER OF THE ONE HUNDRED MILLION SET ASIDE FOR COMPLIANCE AND NOT AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO SLOTS IF CD <u>&lt;c.green&gt; TO SET A DATE&lt;/c&gt;</u> DESIGNATES THAT THEY DON'T NEED THIS HUNDRED MILLION. ON THAT IS THAT THE FUNDS THEY DON'T DESIGNATE THAT THEY NEED FOR COMPLIANCE WOULD BE CARRIED OVER THROUGH THE NEXT BUDGET YEAR. AND WE THINK HEARING THESE FUND OVER WOULD HELP MITIGATE THE REST OF WHETHER THIS IS ONETIME ONGOING FUNDING. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU DISCUSSED. THANK YOU I JUST KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS OF THE BUDGET WHICH WE'VE MADE A RATHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LEGISLATURE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE'VE INCREASED FUNDING FOR EARLY EDUCATION CHILDCARE PROGRAMS BY MORE THAN ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. IN THE MAY REVISION WE INCLUDED A TOTAL INCREASE OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION GENERAL FUND FOR STATE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE. FULLY FUNDING PRIOR YOUR POLICY CHANGES AND RELATED CASELOAD INCREASES AGREED TO WITH THE LEGISLATURE. WE WOULD KNOW IN THE ANNALS HAS TALKED ABOUT THE FEDERAL CHILD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDS. THE TIMING OF THE NOTIFICATION OF THE GRANT FUNDS DIDN'T ALIGN WITH OUR RELEASE OF THE MAY REVISE SO THERE'S A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE THERE WE WOULD NOTE THAT SUBSEQUENT. IN SUBSEQUENT CONVERSATIONS WE'VE LEARNED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAS RECEIVED GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT TO EXPECT THESE FUNDS BE ON FEDERAL FISCAL YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN. SO WE WOULD CHEST I KNOW CAUTION IN USING THESE FUNDS IN PARTICULAR FOR ANY ON GOING PURPOSES BASED ON THAT GUIDANCE. THANK YOU COMBAT TO THE COMMITTEE. SOURCE COULD. THANK YOU I'M. I MEAN THE FEDS ARE JUST LIKE US THEY PROVE BUDGET FOR A YEAR BUT THERE. THAT EXPANSION. THE FEDERAL CBGB SPAN XIN. IN THAT BASE FUNDING. THIS WASN'T THE FIRST YEAR OF IT CORRECT. SO. I GUESS I'M. LESS CONCERNED ABOUT. ANY FEDERAL MONEY WE HAVE WHETHER THEY WARN US OR NOT MIGHT TURN INTO ONE TIME. BUT GIVEN THAT THIS HAS NOT BEEN. I'M NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT IT BEING PERCEIVED AS ONE TIME ONLY. AND I THINK THAT. WHATEVER WE CAN USE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE. ABLE TO HAVE JOKE HERE WE SHOULD. KNOWING THAT YOU KNOW WE FACE A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE FOR MANY MANY REASONS. WHAT I WANTED? UNDERSTAND ABOUT. THE SENATE'S ACTION ON USING IT FOR CD USE. HELPING THEM GET INTO COMPLIANCE. I DO WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATE FROM THEM AS TO WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. TERM. THIS SEEMS LIKE. I APPRECIATE WHAT AT RUNNING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THIS SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY THAT WE MIGHT. THAT IF WE COULD USE. MORE OF IT FOR. ACTUALLY PROVIDING CARE TO CHILDREN. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA SO. STRAIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN A LITTLE BETTER. I'M JUST SUCH A JUST ADDRESS YOUR FIRST QUESTION SO SINCE CCD BG MONEY IS NOT NEW BUT THEY INCREASE THAT WE'RE SEEING THIS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE THAT IS A NEW. THING THAT IS A NEW ON ME AUGMENTATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR THAT WE'RE SEEING THE TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO MILLION OF EXTRA FEDERAL FUNDS. OTHER TO GET YOUR SECOND QUEEN IS. TO MY KNOWLEDGE ARE CURRENTLY NOT ESTIMATES ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO GET IT TO COMPLIANCE WITH WITH CCD BJ. BUT THAT IS THE INTENTION OF THE SENATE PLAN THAT THEY WOULD GO AND MAKE A PLAN FOR WHAT THEY WOULD. OR HOW THEY WOULD GET IN COMPLIANCE WITH CCD BG AND THEN REPORT THAT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. I'M. IS IT THAT DIFFICULT FIRST CD TO ESTIMATE FOR US. I READ A. EVERYBODY ELSE ASK YOU. EARLIER GROWTH AWAY I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THE PART OF THE THE CHALLENGE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THE COSTS ARE IS. IS TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHETHER THE WEAVERS THAT WE HAVE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE MOVING FORWARD AND WHAT THE PLAN OR THE EXPECTATIONS ARE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR. MEET AT BEING A COMPLAINT SO WHAT. SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE IT WHERE THERE'S BEEN THE MOST CONCERNS ARE REGARDING. I'M A STAR REQUIRING THAT THERE BE ANNUAL. EXPERT INSPECTIONS OF LICENSED FACILITIES OF THE STATE CURRENT DOES SOMETHING MORE LIKE EVERY THREE YEARS. AND THEN THERE'S ALSO. SOME EXPECTATION THAT THERE BE SOME VISITING OF LICENSE EXEMPT. PROVIDER SO. PEOPLE ARE PROVIDING CARE IN THEIR HOMES WHO ARE WHO ARE NOT LICENSED IN TRYING TO DO SOME KIND OF VISIT EVERY YEAR. THAT BUT THOSE COSTS COULD BE VERY. EXPENSIVE AND WE HAVE A LOT NO WEAVER FROM SOMOS REQUIREMENTS SO. PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF FIGURING OUT WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH THE COULD BE AND. INAPPROPRIATE PLAN FOR THE STATE AND THEN AFTER THAT WE WE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT THE COST WOULD BE BUT WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A KID WITH A NOT IT'S DIFFICULT TO COME UP WITH AN EXACT NUMBERS. SEEMS LIKE A VERY IT'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND. I JUST THINK IT'S WE FURTHER DELIVERY. MIGHT BE WORTH IT FOR US TO. TRY TO GET THEM TO BE A LITTLE MORE. HE WAS A LITTLE FIRMER NUMBERS AND IF NOT THEN. PROVIDE. APPROVED A LOWER AMOUNT. IN DIRECT MORE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE MORE CHILDCARE SLOTS IN THEN IF WE NEED TO AUGMENTED. THAT'S MY. IF I MAY OUT ON TO THE ALEJO'S I RESPONSE. THAT WE WOULD AGREE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT BEN AND VERY EXPLICIT AND THERE HAS HOW THE INTERPRETING THE REQUIREMENTS OF CCTV CHIEF FEDERAL REAUTHORIZATION ARE THE REAUTHORIZATION OF THE CITY BG. NAM WHEN WE'VE DONE COST ESTIMATES FOR OURSELVES TO CAN LOOK AT THESE COST WE USUALLY COME UP WITH A NUMBER AROUND THIRTY MILLION FOR. ANNUAL LICENSE INSPECTIONS. AND WE USUALLY COME UP WITH ESTIMATES IN THE LOW TENS OF MILLIONS FOR LICENSE EXEMPT INSPECTIONS. THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO KNOW FOR SURE HOWEVER. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE ALRIGHT I CAN IMAGINE IT BUT YEAH DIFFERENCE IN IN WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING IS IN THE MAGNITUDE OF FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION IN WERE. WE ARE HAVE A NIGHT OF THE FORCES UPWARDS TO HUNDRED MILLION AND SO. WHILE YES IT MAY BE THAT IT COSTS MORE THAN THE FORTY TO FIFTY YOU'RE DESCRIBING. IF WE. IF IT DOESN'T COME TO THAT THEN WE EVEN AFFECT TIED UP FIFTY MILLION. FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG THAT COULD INSTEAD BE USED RIGHT AWAY TO HELP FAMILIES AND CHILDREN IMMEDIATELY I THINK WE WOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH USING ANY OF THE MONEY FOR SLICE. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR THE NON CONTINUANCE OF THE FUNDS IN THE GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO. YOU KNOW SLOTS ARE AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES AS LONG AS THEY REMAIN ELIGIBLE FOR THEM. SO WE WOULD BASICALLY BE SOMEBODY LAST FOR ONE YEAR AND THEN I I I APPRECIATE THAT DO CAUTION TO AND YET WE KNOW THAT. SO WHEN THAT IF THE CHILD'S THREE YEARS OLD THREE WE GIVE MUST FIGHT FOR YOUR THEN THEY GET TO BE FOUR YEARS OLD MAYBE THEN THEY GO TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THAT THEY DON'T NEED THAT SLOT SO I'M. A LITTLE BIT LESS CONCERNED ABOUT. IT. WEATHER YOU KNOW WHERE WE HAVE TO MODIFY THE FUNDING LATER RIGHT. THAT'S MY THING. THANK YOU CENTER. BLOOM. THANK YOU. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO PRIORITIZE INCREASING THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND AND AND THAT. I IS WHAT THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE PLAN DO. BUT I I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE A BLOCK GRANT TO A DOLLARS. WHERE WE HAVE DISCRETION WE OUGHT TO BE USING THAT TO ALSO PRIORITIZE MORE SLOT I DID SLOTS AND? I WANT TO ASK A QUESTION UP PERHAPS OF LA NO REGARDING. THE PROPOSAL TO REMOVE TITLED TWENTY TWO. FROM. I THINK IT'S OVER AT A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT AND IN PARTICULAR WHETHER IT IS SET A. THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. FOR. A FOR THIS YOUNGER POPULATION MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS NO TO. TITLED TWENTY TWO OVERSIGHT THERE'S UP THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE RANGE OF. OVERSIGHT ISSUES THAT DON'T TAKE PLACE THAT. AT THESE FACILITIES AND THAT THAT WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF. PERHAPS YOU CAN. DELVE INTO THAT'LL BUT. IT'S A GOOD. LAST YEAR AS PART OF THE BUDGET. THE THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED. LANGUAGE THAT WOULD EXEMPT. A PROVIDERS OF STATE PRESCHOOL SO UPSTATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUN IN AND. SCHOOLS THAT WERE BY SCHOOL DISTRICT OPERATE AN ALLEY FACILITIES. THAT THEY WOULD BE EXEMPT FROM THOSE TITLE TWENTY TWO REQUIREMENTS. DOT DOT DOT BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN. I'M SO I THOUGHT NOT TAKEN EFFECT. THAT THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AND IN THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL ALSO REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO COMMUNITY CALLED THE WORK GROUP. TO MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT IF ANY ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE ADDED TO OUR OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS EVER GONNA BECOME EXEMPT OF TITLE TWENTY TWO. I'M SO WE DID. WE DID. THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP CAME WITH SOME RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHEN WE WROTE ABOUT THOSE THAT ARE IN A REPORT. THEY RECOMMEND ADDING SOME SOME SPECIFIC RULES INTO OUR REGULATIONS FOR THESE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THEN RECOMMENDING SOME CHANGES TO. THE EXISTING COMPLAINT PROCESS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO USE. ARE BOTH HOUSES OF ADOPTED ITS INTO ADOPTED LANGUAGE THAT'S ARE IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGES THAT CAME OUT OF ETHICAL TO RECRUIT. SO. IF IF THOSE WERE TO TAKE EFFECT THEM BEGINNING JULY FIRST TWENTY NINETEEN THERE WOULD NOT BE THE TITLE TWENTY TWO ACCORDING TO THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. ON AN ALLEY A SILLY BUT THEY WOULD HAVE THESE ADDED. HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE THAT WERE ARE REQUIRED TO STICK WITH THE WORK GROUP AND THEY WOULD HAVE A CHANGES TO A COMPLETE PROCESS TO IT TO OUR. PROCESS THESE COMPLAINTS IN A MORE EXPEDITED MANNER. IF I MAY ADD TO THE ILIAS RESPONSE. WE WHEN THE LANGUAGE WAS ORIGINALLY BACK CONSTRUCTED THE IDEA WAS TO LOOK AT WHAT OF THE CURRENT DIFFERENCES AND HEALTH AND SAFETY BETWEEN TITLE FIVE. AND TITLE TWENTY TWO TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT MISSING ANYTHING ENTITLED FIVE THAT WAS CONTAINED IN TITLE TWENTY TWO. WE GOT TO BE A PART OF. AND LISTEN IN ON THE. STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AT THE ILIO DESCRIBED THAT THEY DID AND WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY MADE DO ADDRESS THE REMAINING ISSUES BETWEEN TITLE FIVE ENTITLED TWENTY TWO. AND RECOMMEND. SUPPORTING THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. THANK YOU I'VE BEEN APPROACHED BY SOME ADVOCATES WHO FEEL OTHERWISE SO. MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WE CANNOT DISCUSS LITTLE. AND IN ALL OF THAT MORE DETAIL LATER. THANK YOU. THE SHOPS THIS REPORT COMMENT. LOOKING AT BOTH THE PLANS I THINK THE SENATE PLAN IS SUPERIOR. ALSO FROM MY POSITION I'D. LIKE TO INVITE ONE ITEM TO STRIKE ME THE MOST. IS THE FORTY ONE MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE DEALING IN THIS AREA. IN MY PREVIOUS LIFE I USED TO RUN CHILDCARE PROGRAMS BE RESPONSIBLE FOR INSPECTING THEM AT HOLD TEAM TO DO THAT. AND. THAT'S. QUALITIES MOST A PURPORTED ISSUE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THE FACT WE DON'T EVEN USE WORD CHILD CARE ANYMORE WEEZER. EARLY COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT CHILDREN SO. THE EXPAND OUR. PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THESE FACILITIES SO. IT'S ABOUT THE QUALITY SO I SUPPORT THE SENATE PLAN. THANK YOU. OKAY SINGLE OTHER QUESTIONS WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX. ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MR BROUGHT. SO DEMOGRAPHICALLY LA. AND SO THIS ITEM IS ABOUT RELATE THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SO THAT THE ME REVISED PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WAS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING FOR THE CREATION OF A NEW ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT WOULD BE ARE RUN BY THE US BORDER GOVERNORS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M. THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WAS TO REJECT. THE CREATION OF THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE. I'M THE SENATE ACTION WITH TO MODIFY. TIM TO MODIFY TO ADOPT ONLINE COLLEGE BUT ADDED SOME ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS. TWO OF THE MORE NOTABLE RESTRICTIONS DOT POINT OUT ONE IS THAT THERE'S A TEN YEAR SUNSETON. ON THE COLLEGE AND THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE NEW COLLEGE WOULD DEVELOP. SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT LEAD INTO PATHWAYS THAT EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M SO WE'VE RAISED SOME CONCERNS. IN THE PAST BUT THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE IN PARTICULAR I THINK FIRST WE CAN SEE CLEAR INDICATION FROM ADMINISTRATION OF WHAT EXISTING BARRIERS EXIST AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT THIS ONLINE COLLEGES ADDRESSING. AND WE ALSO HAD CONCERNS WITH THE ABILITY OF AN ONLINE COLLEGE TO. HOW STATEWIDE ACCESS TO THE SORT OF HANDS ON EXPERIENCES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR MOST OF THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE ENROLLED IN THOSE PROGRAMS GET GET ACCESS TO THOSE? SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES SOBRE SO WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND REJECTING THAT PIECE. THAT THERE'S ALSO AN AND ACTIONS THAT BOTH HOUSES TOOK THAT ARE. PROVIDING ONE TIME GRANTS TO EXISTING COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE PROGRAMS. AND SO ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE THERE'S SIXTY MILLION I'M TO CREATE A NEW INSTITUTE. THAT WOULD DEVELOP ONLINE PROGRAMS. AND AND THE THE TARGET GROUP WOULD BE THE SAME TARGETED GROUP THAT THE ADMINISTRATION EVER POSE FOR THE ONLINE COLLEGE WHICH SHOULD BE. WORKING ADULTS WITH NO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION CREDENTIALS ARE MORE MOST LIKELY WORKING IN LOW WAGE JOBS OF IDEAS THAT YOU WOULD DEVELOP PROGRAMS FOR THAT PARTICULAR GROUP. AND THE IDEA FOR THIS. FOR THESE ACTIVITIES THAT THAT THE THE PROGRAMS WOULD BE COMPETENCY BASED THAT THERE IS SOME. AND TYPICALLY WHEN PEOPLE USED OVERCOME AT THE BASIC FIGURE THAT PEOPLE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE PROGRAM'S QUICKER AS THEIR MASTERING CONTENT OR THEY CAN GO AT A SLOWER PACE OF ANY A LOT MORE TIME. AND THAT AND THE THE PROGRAM IT WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO NOT DUPLICATE OTHER. OTHER PROGRAMS THAT THAT. ARE ALREADY BEING OFFERED. I'M ON THE SENATE SIDE THERE'S FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED AS GRANTS TO. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN ONLINE CONTENT AND FOR THAT CONTENT TO BE TIED TO EXISTING PATHWAYS. IN IT IN PROGRAMS OFFERED A COMMUNITY COLLEGES. I'M IN ADDITION THE SENATE OFF. REQUIRES THE CHANCES OFFICE TO READ A REPORT THAT WOULD MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW YOU COULD CHANGE NON CREDIT FUNDING RATES TO. TO IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OR ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS NOT JUST IN THE ONLINE PROGRAM BUT MORE BROADLY AND THAT THE FINDINGS ARE RATE AND THE METHOD OF FUNDING IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY VERY. CONCERNED ONE OF THE PRIMARY BARRIERS FOR MORE COMPETENCY BASED PROGRAMS. SO ON THE ON THE ISSUE OF THESE ONE TIME GRANTS WE DO THINK THE PROVIDING SOME FUNDING COULD BE HELPFUL TO HELP OUR IMPROVE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ARE PROGRAM STATEWIDE. WE DO THINK AT COUPLE THINGS WE WOULD RECOMMEND IN IN DEVELOPING THEM IS THAT. YOU PRIORITIZE PROGRAMS THAT. IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS NO ONLINE CONTENT CURRENTLY AND ALSO IN AREAS THAT HAVE RECOGNIZED INDUSTRY DEMANDS THAT YOU ARE CUTTING PROGRAMS THAT. BETTER PROVIDING AND ACCESS TO A NEW PROGRAM THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE AND THAT'S GONNA LEAD TO SOMEONE GOING OUT TO GET A GOOD JOB. I'M WE ALSO WOULD RECOMMEND REQUIRING ALIGNMENT. AS THE THE SENATE DOES IN THEIR. PEACE WITH WITH EXISTING BECAUSE PATHWAYS TO SOMEONE CAN TAKE A SHORT TERM PROGRAM AND THEN BE ABLE TO AYE IF THEY WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THEIR EDUCATION. CAN DO THAT SEAMLESSLY WITHOUT HAVING TO START FROM SCRATCH. ARM AND AND THEN FINALLY I'M WE WOULD RECOMMEND ADOPTING THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. IN THE SENATE VERSION. THE SENATE VERSION HAS THIS REPORTING REQUIREMENT WHICH WOULD POTENTIALLY HELP MAKE CHANGE OF SYSTEM WIDE FOR APPROVING COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATION. AND THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. WOULD REQUIRE THESE NEW PROGRAMS TO ALSO BE COMPETENCY BASED SO TOGETHER IF YOU HAVE THOSE TWO REQUIREMENTS TOGETHER YOU CAN HAVE A LOT MORE. SORT OF SYSTEM WIDE IT CHANGED TO IMPROVE WHAT'S GOING ON IN IN PROGRAMS TO BEGIN TO HAVE MORE OF THEM BECOME PRETTY. SALAS UP THERE BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISS COSTA. THINK YOU THE MINISTRATIONS WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS TO COMBAT POVERTY AND WE'VE YOU THIS PROPOSAL ABOUT ONLINE COLLEGE AS ANOTHER TOOL. IN COMBATING POVERTY WE SUPPORT IN GENERAL THE SENATE'S VERSION AND. WHICH DID ADOPT OUR PROPOSAL ON THE ON MY COLLEGE. AND THE SENATE ALSO PROPOSES FORTY FOUR MILLION ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT. FOR THE ONLINE EDUCATION AND INITIATIVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR PROBLEMS WITHOUT INVESTMENT IS JUST HOW IT'S PAID PACKAGE. ON THERE A COUPLE OF OTHER THINGS NOTABLY OUR. IRON FUNDING. PROPOSAL FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT ARE USED TO PAY FOR THAT BUT WE DON'T HAVE PARTICULAR PROBLEMS WITH THAT AND PROGRAM BEING FUNDED. ANY GUARD MAJOR CONCERN WITH THE ASSEMBLY IS PROPOSAL IS THAT BACK IN MAY THE GOVERNOR ASKED THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS IN THIS WORLD AND WE'VE WAITED PRETTY HEAVILY WHETHER OR NOT. WE SHOULD INCLUDE KIND OF ADDITIONAL DOLLARS WITHIN THE EXISTING SYSTEM OR IF WE NEEDED SOMETHING NEW AND WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT FOR THE TWO POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. THAT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR SOME COLLEGE EXPERIENCE BUT NOT THE DEGREE. REALLY WE NEED A NEW MODEL. THESE CALIFORNIANS ARE BEING SERVED HOT MANY OF THEM ARE IN LOW WAGE JOBS AND THIS IS A WAY FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR EARNING POTENTIAL BY THINKING ABOUT IT IN A COMPLETELY NEW WAY. WITHOUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU DONE A GREAT JOB. ON SUB ONE WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING THE ONLINE. COLLEGE AND AND I FIND MOST THE TIME AND IN IN THE HEARINGS I LEAN TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT THIS DISCUSSION WAS PRETTY ROBUST THAN. IT IT IT HAS PRETTY STRONG FEELINGS ON BOTH SIDES WHETHER TO ESTABLISH A CALL AND ONLINE. DISTRICT OR NOT. AND SO I. I FIND THAT THE ASSEMBLY SIR PROJ IS VERY REASONABLE. I'VE TO TRY AND MAYBE FACE AND BASED ON ALL THE EXISTING RESOURCES AS OPPOSED TO. STARTING A WHOLE NEW DISTRICT. JUST ON MINE. SO CALLED A COLLEAGUES A SURE WIN AND I REVIEWED ALL THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS OF ALL. SEVENTY TWO DISTRICTS. ALL OF THEM BUT ONE. HAVE AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. AND IF YOU COMBINE ALL THAT THE DISTRICTS IT OUT THERE. NEVER A NEGATIVE. DOT DEFICIT OF FIVE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT. COMMITTEE COLLEGES WERE WERE WE HAVE SOME FISCAL ISSUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT. AT THE END OF THIS MONTH FISH CAN BE NEXT MONTH JUNE THIRTIETH. THE COLLEGES WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADD TO THEIR. BALANCE SHEETS THE. UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL AND THAT WILL ADD ANOTHER TWO AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS BASED ON. DOCUMENTATION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET SO WE HAVE. MANY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THAT ARE UNDER WATER WITH ONE SIMPLE METRIC OF A BILLION DOLLARS SO. I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION AS WE KIND OF LOOK AT HOW WE SPEND MONEY BECAUSE. IF WE'RE GOING TO START ANOTHER DISTRICT SEVENTY THREE. AND IN THE SENATE HAS RECOMMENDED. PROHIBITING THE NEW COLLEGE FROM CHARGING FEES HIGHER THAN A TRADITIONAL COLLEGE. YOU'RE YOU'RE ALREADY PUTTING IT AT A DISADVANTAGE YOU'RE YOU'RE HINDERING IT BECAUSE OF. THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN ONLINE COLLEGE WOULD BE A WOULD BE A REALLY MASSIVE MONEYMAKER BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA. LIMIT IT TO THE SAME FEES YOU'RE CHARGED. PER COURSES AT OUR OTHER DISTRICTS YOU'RE READING. ASKING FOR. EXPENDITURES IN EXCESS OF REVENUES. SO I JUST WANT TO BRING THAT UP. BRISTER CHAIRS YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT THE LONG TERM. I'VE I'VE BEEN CONCERN ON SUB ONE ABOUT OUR. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS UPRIGHT BRING IT UP. UNDER THE UC AND CSU BUT. WE KNOW WHERE THE TENURE PLANTS WERE. ORANGE COUNTY. FILED FOR CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY. SO WE HAVE A STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLANNER GOES OUT TEN YEARS WE KNOW. WHAT'S HAPPENING AND AND I WOULD JUST LOVE TO SEE WHERE ARE OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. GOING IN AND AND WHEN WILL THEY BE HERE. TO ASK FOR SIGNIFICANT CHUNKS OF MONEY BECAUSE THERE WILL BECOME A POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T CHARGE A HIGHER TUITION. SO I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE FOR THOSE OF FOLLOW THEY MAY INHERIT. A PRETTY STICKY WICKET AND I JUST WANTED TO A. SEE IF SHE COULD DO STICKY WICKET DOLLARS AYE. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SHE SIGNALED YOU IF YOU DO DRAFT FOR. DID THIS EARLY ó WERE BY FINANCE ONE ADDRESS. I GUESS IS A STATEMENT BUT ALSO SORT OF QUESTION. TERMS OF HOW DO WE A LONG TERM MAKE. THE COMMUNICABLE JUST MORE FINANCIALLY STABLE BUT ALSO HOW HOW DO THE ONLINE PROGRAM AS LONG TERM SORT OF PAPER. PAY FOR THEMSELVES BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY BE REVENUE OUR GENERATOR WELL OFF PICKED TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE BEFORE US WHICH IS THE COST STRUCTURE OF AN ONLINE COLLEGE IS MUCH PREFERABLE. CANDIDLY. BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE FACILITY BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER COST FACTORS THAT AND OTHER LOCAL COMMUNICATES DISTRICTS ARE FACED WITH. SECONDARILY THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T HAVE ANY CONCERN WITH THE SENATE PROPOSAL THAT WE WOULD KEEP THE FEES THIS IS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION. AND AS SUCH IT WOULD FALL IN LINE WITH CAN YOU COLLEGES SEE ISSUE IN YOU SEE TO KEEP FEES AFFORDABLE FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND WE DON'T TAKE ANY ISSUE. ON WITH KEEPING OUR FEES THAT THAT SORT OF A LEVEL. THANK YOU. I SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU AS CHAIR. FIRST I WANT TO SAY ONE TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION. FOR THIS ONLINE EFFORT I'VE THINK I'VE BEEN SAYING I THINK CONSISTENTLY SINCE I'VE BEEN UP HERE. BOTH TO OUR FRIENDS IN K. THROUGH TWELVE AND. OUR FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN AND OF SEE ISSUE WHEN YOU SEE THAT. GIVEN THE BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS AT THE STATE. HAS MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE TIME TO TALK TO SOME EXTENT TO ANOTHER. AND WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS IN EDUCATION TODAY JUST BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR THE PAST SIXTY YEARS THAT WAY. AND SO THIS ONLINE EFFORT IN THIS EMPHASIS ON TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE PATH. FOR ONLINE EDUCATION I THINK IS A VALUABLE ONE IN ONE WORST COMMENDING. HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED IN THE MILITARY WE CALL IT THE TWO'S TO TAIL RATIO. YOU CERTAINLY WANT MORE TEETH THAN YOU HAVE TALE BECAUSE THEY OF COURSE THE TEETH OR WHAT. GIVE YOUR. GIVE YOU THE IMPETUS RIGHT MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND SO ARE WHEN CONSIDERING A TUESDAY TO TAIL RATIO. ONE OF THE ISSUES IT SEEMS TO ME IN SETTING UP A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE IS A SEPARATE ENTITY. IS ALL THAT COMES WITH SETTING UP A NEW COLLEGE. IT'S TAKING A BOARD OF GOVERNORS IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A. ACCUSTOMED TO DEALING WITH THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF A COLLEGE IT'S HIRING A NEW. COLLEGE PRESIDENT IT'S HIRING THE VICE PRESIDENT'S IT NORMALLY HAVE TO FOLLOW A PRESIDENT IT'S HIRING CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS AND ALL THE REST OF THE THINGS THAT I ASSUME WE WILL BE DEALING WITH. WITH A NEW ONLINE. A COLLEGE AND I GUESS THEY'RE HAVING SAID ALL THAT. AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT MONEY IS NOT UNLIMITED EVEN THIS YEAR. WHY WOULD E NOT FOCUS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PROPOSAL THAT THE? ASSEMBLY IS COME UP WITH WERE YOU TAKEN EXISTING COLLEGE OR. THE CHANCELLOR DESIGNATES OF. THE CONSORTIUM OF COLLEGES TO. WITHIN THEIR EXISTING FRAMEWORK SET UP AN INSTITUTE THAT IS AN ONLINE INSTITUTE. WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE A NEW PRESIDENT TO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO HIRE TEN VICE PRESIDENTS WERE WE HAVE? A BOARD OF TRUSTEES OR US. MAYBE A COMBINED BOARD THAT'S CUSTOM TO DEALING WITH THE DAY TO DAY FUNCTIONING OF AN ACADEMIC INSTITUTION. AND ALLOW THESE HOPEFULLY INNOVATIVE ONLINE PROGRAMMES BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. ONLINE PROGRAMS TO SPEED FRESHMAN ENGLISH YOUR BASIC MATH OR WHATEVER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PUTTING ONLINE PROGRAMS INTO. PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT AS I UNDERSTAND IT. TO TAKE FOLKS WHO ARE. OR OLDER BUT CERTAINLY MUCH YOUNGER THAN I AM AND TAKE THEM INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR SKILLS SO WE WOULD TAKE THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE NOT SPEND IT ON STRUCTURE INFRASTRUCTURE BUREAUCRACY. AND PUSH IT DOWN TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONLINE COURSES. THE SETTING OF GOALS OBJECTIVES METRICS AND MEASUREMENT TO MAKE SURE AT LEAST INITIALLY. THAT THE ONLINE PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL AND THEN CONSIDER WHETHER WE WANT TO PUT. ANOTHER COLLEGE ON THE CHALKBOARD OF THE CHANCELLOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. THAT'S A LONG QUESTION MY QUESTION TO BOIL IT DOWN AS WHY NOT FOCUS ON THE ASSEMBLIES COLLEGE YOUR CONSORTIUM. AN INSTITUTE PROPOSAL. SENATOR I THINK I WOULD REFERENCE YOUR FIRST COMMENT ON THIS MATTER WHICH IS THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS HAVE TO LOOK AT DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY. AND WE FEEL COMMUNICATIVE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT MISSIONS IMPORTANT MISSIONS ON INCLUDING. CERTIFICATES DEGREES THIS IS A VERY TARGETED APPROACH REALLY BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE RESEARCH ABOUT ONLINE OBVIOUSLY WE'VE TALKED IS ADMINISTRATION FREQUENTLY ABOUT ONLINE AND WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN. UTILIZE IT MORE EFFECTIVELY WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION. ADULTS GENERALLY DO YOU BETTER THAN HANGING AYE TRADITIONAL COLLEGE STUDENT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT ON THE WE FELT THAT CREATING A NEW ENTITY. ON THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS SUCH AS AN ACADEMIC CALENDAR WHERE THEY CAN OFFER CURRICULUM ON A ROLLING BASIS FOR PEOPLE CAN FIND OUT ON GOING TO TAKE THESE COURSES. IS THE MORE PREFERRED APPROACH I WOULDN'T KNOW. THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT FIRST YEAR COST IS MORE SIGNIFICANT TO YOUR POINT OF BUILDING OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT WE FEEL TEN TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR THE EFFORT WHICH. I THINK IS A REALLY. REASONABLE COST. GIVEN THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WE EXPECT TO SEE FOR WORKING CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE WHO WILL EARN A MORE. AND BETTER LIVING WAGE GIVEN HIGH HOUSING COSTS AND SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WORKING CALIFORNIANS ARE FACING. WELL I CERTAINLY THINK THE EFFORTS NOTABLE ON I THINK WHETHER WE HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN APPROACH AS TO WHETHER WE DO IT WITH AN INSTITUTE WOULD DO WITH A SEPARATE. ONLINE COLLEGE I THINK WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH IT BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THAT THAT IMPORTANT. TO THE WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAIN I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS IN THANK YOU UP MISTER. THANK YOU MISTER ABRUPT. IT'S GOING TO SAVE. HE SAID BLOOM HE LOOKED AT ME. YOU CAN MAKE THAT. THAT'S RIGHT WILL. I DO THE QUESTIONS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I WIN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL FOR YOUR THIS CAME OUT IN JANUARY I WAS EXTREMELY ENTHUSIASTIC BECAUSE I'M CONVINCED THAT. THIS COULD REALLY BE THE CATALYST FOR AS YOU SAY POVERTY REDUCTION AND REACHING A WHOLE NEW STRATOFORTRESSES AT A REDUCED COST SO. I WAS A AND TUESDAY AFTER SUPPORTER AND WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE MAY REVISE CAME OUT. AND PUT SOME SUBSTANTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON THAT MEAN FOR EXAMPLE THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE TYPE OF ONLINE OFFERINGS THAT COULD BE OFFERED. OTHER REQUIREMENT FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR FACULTY THE RESTRICTIONS TO ONLINE EDUCATION ONLY SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT CAPITALIZE KIND OF MY THINKING THAT MAYBE THAT WASN'T THE RIGHT WAY I GO. AND I WONDERED IF YOU COULD ELABORATE ON WHAT SOME OF THE DECISION FACTORS WERE IN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPOSAL IN JANUARY AND MAY. I WAS RED SUIT HE SAID WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE. MAYOR VISION AND AMENDMENTS REALLY. ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS OUR MANY CONCERNS THAT. WE BIT WE HEARD ABOUT THE ONLY COLLEGE PROPOSAL ONE OF THEM WAS TO ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SO WE I TOOK AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW AT THE COLLEGE TO PARTNER WITH IN ITS EXISTING DISTRICT FOR THE PURPOSES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S A STRUCTURE IN. PLACE. FOR THAT TO HAPPEN ONCE THE COLLEGE IS ESTABLISHED I WOULD NOTE THAT THE OTHER AMENDMENTS AND. THE ME REVISION. REALLY ATTEMPTED TO STRENGTHEN IT THE. STUDENT OUTCOMES ARE REPORTING A STUDENT SUCCESS OUT WE ADDED I PROVISIONS REGARDING. THE COLLEGE ADOPTING. I REGULATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE COMPLY WITH ACCESSIBILITY IN DISABILITY. PROVISIONS WE ADOPTED ADDITIONAL AYE REPORTING METRICS ON ON STUDENT OUTCOMES AND TO ENSURE THAT THE COLLEGES REPORTING ON WEIGHT GAIN OUT FOR STUDENTS AND ENSURING THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORKING FOR THAT INTENDED. A POPULATION THERE WERE SOME AREAS AT. AMENDMENTS IN SOME AREAS REGARDING CURRICULUM AND THOSE WHO REALLY JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPED BY THE COLLEGE AND ITS FACULTY WOULD HAVE TO SEE PROTECTIONS. AS. OTHER CURRICULUM I DEVELOP A FACULTY AT OTHER COLLEGES AND A REALLY. CLARIFY THE INTENT TO DEVELOP UNIQUE CONTENT TO THAT ISN'T DEPLETED OF. OF ON CONTENT IT UP OTHER COLLEGES SO THOSE WERE THE SEVEN SEVEN MEN MEN'S THAT REALLY TRIED TO STRENGTH AND. THE REPORTING AND THE TYPE OF INSTRUCTION AND THE TYPE OF ON CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT THE COLLEGE. WELL IN RETROSPECT I I WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN THAT HAPPENED OF MY INTERPRETATION OF IT WAS A BIT DIFFERENT. I THINK THAT THE EXISTING SYSTEM GOT ITS CLAWS IN. RIGHT AND. THEY'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE ONLINE OFFERING LOOK MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A DIRE MISTAKE BECAUSE. THE WHOLE. OF THE WHOLE REASON FOR TRANSITION AND ONLINE OFFERINGS. IS TO AVOID BEING LOCKED INTO AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT'S BASED ON. A PARADIGM HUNDRED YEARS OLD. RIGHT WE HAVE TECHNOLOGY AND AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO DELIVER AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAT WE DID. NOT EVEN TWENTY YEARS AGO AND I THINK THAT THAT A SHIFT TO THAT KIND OF. EDUCATIONAL MODEL ALSO REQUIRES SHIFT IN OUR THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT KIND OF OFFERING LOOKS LIKE. AND I THINK IT'S A A DIRE MISTAKE TO ASSUME THAT IT LOOKS JUST LIKE WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND SO. THAT'S WHY I WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT THE IT LOOKED LIKE THE EXISTING SYSTEM WAS TRYING TO MAKE IT LOOK JUST LIKE ANOTHER BRANCH OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT KINDA CATALYZE THE SANDWICH THINKING ABOUT. GOING TO DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND AND THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. AND IF I MAY ADD TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IS IN THE PROPOSAL IS AT THAT THE COLLEGE WOULD BE TIED TO THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR AND. I WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TO EXPLORE DEVELOPING COMPETENCY BASED EDUCATIONS AND THOSE ARE TWO CORE COMPONENTS THAT ARE A PART OF THE PROPOSAL CHURCH AND THOSE ARE UNLIKE. TRADITIONAL OFFERINGS BUT EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU TALK ABOUT THE CHANGES TO BE MADE. ARTWORK IT SEEMED LIKE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT LOOK MORE LIKE A TRADITIONAL OFFERING AND I JUST I THINK THAT'S A MISTAKE. IF FOR GOODS THAT I THINK THIS IS A A MYSTERY AUTHOR MEMORABLE ROLE TO GOT TO ADD SOME COMMENTS ON JUST. THE ISSUE OF AS YOU DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO HAVE PROVIDED SOME FUNDING FOR IT FOR ONLINE. PROGRAMS DECIDING WHAT YOU WHAT THE INTENT OF THAT THAT FUNDING IS FOR. IF. IF YOU WANT THERE TO BE. IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. THEN I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THE THE ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE PORTION OF THE. A ONE TIME PORTION OF THE SENATE VERSION WHERE YOU'RE PROVIDING FUNDING TO COLLEGES WILL HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING RULES OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE THE PROGRAMS WORK. THAT FIFTH IF IF YOU WANT THE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE TO IMPROVING YOUR NOT GONNA CHANGE THE RULES THEN THE FOLKS HERE GIVING THE MONEY TO TO EXPERIMENT COME UP IN THE PROGRAMS. HAVE TO USE THOSE SAME RULES IF YOU'RE DEFINING AN ONLINE COLLEGE AND YOU WANT TO BE DEFERRED YOU DO NEED TO HAVE A COMPLETE DIFFERENT MISSION ATTACK. THE IDEA THAT THEY WOULD BE. DEFERRED AND YOU NEED TO GET TO DO INNOVATIVE THINGS BUT IF YOU'RE DOING THAT YOU'RE ALSO THOSE BATS ALSO MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE AND THE REST OF THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT THESE CHANGES. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO THEY'LL GET THE PLAY BY THE FEDERAL SITE JUST THAT. ARE AT IT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHAT THE MISSION OF THE TH DUH INSTITUTE OR THE NEW COLLEGE AND I'M WHAT IS THE WHAT IS YOUR HOPE FOR. WENT WHEN THAT PROGRAM IS IS ROLLED OUT. HOW THAT CHANGES THE SYSTEM MOVING FORWARD IS THAT SOMETHING THAT A SPECIAL INNOVATIVE THING OR THE THING THAT'S INTENDED TO? HELP COLLEGES TO HAVE THEIR OWN SPECIFIC RULES HOW TO HAVE A BETTER OPERATE. AND I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT FROM THIS YOU CAN MOVE ON TERMS OF THE FUNDING AT THE CLOUD CENTER MORE OCCUPANTS IN AS WELL. ACTUALLY IT IT IN THE THIS PROPOSAL WOULDN'T BE OF CONCERN WITH THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE ONCOLOGY PART BECAUSE THE. COLLEGES GETTING TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING RIGHT NOW JUST IN PERPETUITY. AND THEN IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE GETTING. PER AFTER YOU FUNDING AS IT HAS ENROLLMENT SO IT ACTUALLY GETS AND WOULD GET MORE AMOUNT PRESSED YOU BASIS. THEN. CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO SO THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING FOR YOU THINK ABOUT AS YOU IF YOU ARE GOING TO DEVELOP IT ONLY BECAUSE YOU WANT THIS TO BE A CASE RIGHT NOW. I THINK I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY IN INITIALLY AS THE PROGRAM RAMPS UP YOU HAVE THEM ONGOING MONEY BUT IF YOU HAVE BOTH OF THESE IN PLACE WHERE YOU GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF PRESS T. FUNDING. AND TWENTY BILLION ONGOING AND POTENTIALLY A LOWER COST MODEL THEY'RE GETTING A LOT OF MONEY THEN MAYBE IT TAKES OPERATE THE PROGRAM OKAY BUT I THINK WERE INFERIORS AGREEMENT. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE MORE YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA START READ SOMETHING REVOLUTIONARY HAS TO BE REVOLUTIONARY AND THE MORE YOU TRY AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE WHAT WE'VE GOT. THE MORE YEAR DUPLICATIVE OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE BEING DONE IN THAT BY THE. COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT EXIST SO NOW THAT THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE ASSEMBLY MODEL WHICH IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE AS WELL. I THINK IN THIS BOOK I'M NOT SURE WHAT TO MAKE OF. MIGHT A GOOD FRIEND FROM BIG BEARS TALK ABOUT REVOLUTION. THE. I I AM A. A BIG CONCERN. THAT BOTH THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY ARE. IN AGREEMENT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROGRAM IS NOT THE WAY TO GO BECAUSE. I MAKE AND UP SELLING LIKE A HERETIC HERE MAYBE A REVOLUTIONARY HERETIC BUT I I ACTUALLY. AND I'M QUITE PLEASED WITH THE DIRECTION THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO TAKE ON THIS ISSUE. AND. OUTLOOK. WERE NOT A REVOLUTIONARY ORGANIZATION THAT MOST CASES WERE. A DELIBERATIVE BODY THAT COMPROMISES TO GET THINGS DONE AND SO THERE ARE SOME COMPROMISES I THINK MOST OF THEM ARE ARE. A WEALTH. WELL THOUGHT OUT AND WELL INTENTIONED. A IN IN OTHER MAY REVISE PROPOSAL BUT I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS ISSUE ABOUT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL IT IS. ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROPOSALS THAT ARE BEING MADE TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF INCOME INEQUALITY. OF WERE REALLY FOCUSED IN WITH THIS PROPOSAL IN THE ADMINISTRATION HAS FOCUSED IN. ON. A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE NOT BEING SERVED BY THE CURRENT COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. FOR ALL THE GOOD THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DOES. THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO CAN BENEFIT FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. AND SO I I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY BEARS ARE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION BECAUSE. THE. INEQUALITY THAT WE SEE CURRENTLY FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS IS ONLY GOING TO INCREASE WITH MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT WERE SAYING AND WE HAVE TO BE. PUTTING CALIFORNIA'S IN A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN KEEP UP WITH THAT CHANGE AND WHERE MANY HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND CAN'T CATCH UP AND I THINK THAT THE. OTHER THAT'S WHAT THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS TO DO. THANK YOU. GIPSON NO OTHER COMMENTS. WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUES SEVEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGE PORTION. AND SO THAT'S ON THE ISSUE HERE THOUGH THAT MAY REVISE OUR FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I'M. WAS. TO CHANGE THAT THE EXISTING ARE COMMITTEE BECAUSE FUNDING APPORTIONMENT SYSTEM WHICH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY BASED ON A DISC FULL TIME EQUIVALENT ENROLLMENT. AND AND SHIFT TO A SYSTEM THAT WAS SIXTY PERCENT BASED ON ENROLLMENT TWENTY PERCENT BASED ON THE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AMERICAN ME BECAUSE DISTRICT. AND TWENTY PERCENT BASED ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES. I MEAN AND THAT INCLUDED A TOTAL I'M IN THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A TOTAL OF OUR TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE MILLION. TO ALSO INCLUDE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION SO THAT EVERY COMMUNICATIVE DISTRICT WOULD GET AT LEAST WHAT THEY GOT IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN GROW BY COST OF LIVING. ANSELMO'S HOLD HARMLESS PRISONS WOULD PHASE OUT OVER TIME BUT THAT WAS THAT THE PROPOSAL FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THEY ASSEMBLY REJECTS. THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND THEN DOESN'T PROVIDE THAT TO SEVENTY NINE ABOUT THAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE ALARMIST BUT INSTEAD PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A BASE INCREASE. AND THE FIRST CALL ON THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE TO PROVIDE TO COLLEGES. OR COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS WHO WOULD. ARE POTENTIALLY DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND MY FEET REDUCTION IN FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING. AT LEAST A COLA I'M IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ARE AND THEN THE THE REMAINDER OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR BASS APPORTIONMENT INCREASES FOR THE COLLEGES. I'M THE THE ASSEMBLY ACTION ALSO REQUIRES THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND TO CREATE A TASK FORCE AND REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE BY MARCH FIRST TO TWENTY NINETEEN. ON A NEW FUNDING FORMULA. I'M IT AND. DUH TASK FORCE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO LOOK AT OPTIONS FOR PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR STUDENTS CERTAIN STUDENT POPULATIONS. I'M TO LOOK AT WAYS TO MINIMIZE THE VOLATILITY IN FUNDING BECAUSE OF. UPS AND DOWNS IN ENROLLMENT. AND THEN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO THAT FUNDING IN AGGREGATE IS NO LESS THAN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN LEVELS. I'M MOST NOTABLY I WOULD POINT OUT THE TASK FORCE IS NOT. TO LOOK AT PERFORMANCE BASED ARE A PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT IN THE FUNDING FROM YOUR. I'M THE SENATE REJECTED THE FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL AND THEY PROVIDE HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN A BASIC PORTION INCREASES. I'M YOU KNOW KNOW OUR TASK FORCE REQUIREMENT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT SO ISSUE BEFORE. YOU HERE IS REALLY DE UM BOTH BOTH HOUSES ARE REJECTING THE PROPOSAL BOTH A PROVIDING FROM A PORTION INCREASES. SOME SMALL DIFFERENCES I THINK THAT THE BIG. DIFFERENCE IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO LOOK INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF IN FUTURE YEARS CREATING AND A FUNDING FORMULA. I'M STARTING A FEW COMMENTS FOR US INTO IF YOU DO WANT TO KIND OF GO IN THAT DIRECTION WE DO THINK THE TASK FORCE APPROACH. IT MAKES SENSE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR MORE TIME. TO REVIEW THE FORMULAIC CONSIDER WHAT WHAT COMPONENTS YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED WE KNOW THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS THESE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN OUT OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. HOW HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS TO REALLY GET HOOKED A SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE FORMULA? TO GO TO GIVEN THAT THE CHANGES THAT MAY REVISE ARTISTS PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL COMPARED TO THE JANUARY PROPOSAL SO YOU DON'T REALLY ONLY HAD A FEW WEEKS TOOK A LOOK AT THE SPA. PROPOSAL. I'M. THAT THE OTHER ISSUE REPORT OUT IS IF THE A IN IN TERMS OF. HOLDING DISTRICTS HARM WITH ANOTHER'S CONCERNS ABOUT PROVIDING SOME CHRISTIAN SOME STABILITY A* ABILITY IN THE TRANSIT TWO AND A FORMULA. ARM WE ARE CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT. UNPREDICTABILITY IN THE FIRST YEARS BUT WE WERE JUST ARE RECOMMEND THAT ANY OF THESE KINDS HOLE HARNESS PRISON TO BE TEMPORARY. ARE AND EVENTUALLY FADE OUT ON THE GOAL OF CHANGING FUNDING FORMULA IS TO ALIGN WITH A POLICY GOAL THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH THERE MIGHT BE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. FUNDING TO BE BASED ON NEED FOR EXAMPLE FOR CERTAIN STERN POPULATIONS OR TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR. IMPROVING PERFORMANCE. DOT THAT THE DUMB THE LEAD THE LESS YOU LEAVE FOR A HOLD HARMLESS THE MORE YOU AVAILABLE TO FUND THOSE GOALS I'M SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THAT THE BILL BE TEMPORARY. AND THEN I THINK WE WOULD JUST POINT OUT AND IF YOU ARE. FOCUSED IF YOU'RE GOING TO CONSIDER AYE MAKING CHANGES IN LOOKING AT THE BOTTLE SERVICES FOR CERTAIN STUDENTS. WE DIDN'T WE WROTE A REPORT IN DECEMBER ARE OF LAST YEAR AT THE REQUEST OF THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING AT. PROVIDING SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME AND FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS ARE IN IN THE ENTIRE HARITH SYSTEM BUT WE HAD. SUCH A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THERE WE TALKED ABOUT THE THE POTENTIAL FOR A STREAMLINING EXISTING CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THAT THAT EXIST AND POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THAT COLLAPSES THE. ATOM SOMOS PROGRAMS WOULD PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH STREAMLINED PLANNING FOR COLLEGES WOULD REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND IMPROVE COORDINATION AT THE COLLEGE LEVEL. I'M THERE WAS THERE ARE WORTH THREE PROGRAMS ARE CONSOLIDATING THE MAY REVISE IN ALL HOUSES OUT BOTH HOUSES ADOPTED THAT ACTION BUT WE THINK THAT THERE'S MORE THAT YOU COULD DO PERSON SEATS HERE. TO PROVIDE MORE STREAMLINING FOR OUR COMMITTEE COLLEGES. THANK YOU. SIR NIELSEN. WHERE DID SERVICE ARE CENTER DUH MISS COST? I BOUGHT DEFINITELY WANT TO COMMENT ON THE FROM THE DIVESTITURE. AS THE ANALYST NOTED WE'VE BUILT IN A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO HOLD COMMITTEE BECAUSE DISTRICTS HARMLESS AS WE TRANSITION TO THIS NEW FUNDING MODEL THIS FUNDING MODEL IS PREDICATED ON SOME OF THE WORK THAT HAPPENED AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. ON VISION FOR SUCCESS AND REALLY WHAT IT WOULD DO IS A LYING HOW WE FUND COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH A MORE STUDENT CENTERED APPROACH. ADDITIONALLY I WOULD KNOW IN GOING BACK TO SENATOR MORLOCKS QUESTIONED DURING THE K. TWELVE A PORTION OF THE AGENDA AND WHICH WE SEE EIGHTY A DECLINING. THAT'S A DEMOGRAPHIC TREND THAT THE WAVE EVENTUALLY THAT WILL GET TO OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND ROME ACCOUNTS IS WELL. IN SO BY MOVING TO A MIX REALLY. OF ENROLLMENT AND. PERFORMANCE SPACE. I YOU CAN HELP MITIGATE AGAINST THAT. I WOULD KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE PROPOSAL BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELEASE AND MAY REVISE THOSE WERE PREDICATED ON THAT MEETINGS WE HAD WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND STAKEHOLDERS AND IT SOUGHT TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE FIELD. BASED ON HOW ARE JANUARY PROPOSAL LAFAYETTE WHICH IS NOTES. THAT WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH HOW THE ASSEMBLY CHOSE TO UTILIZE THE FUNDING. WHICH IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY. OBVIOUSLY TONIGHT ARE FUNDING PROPOSAL. AND THEN EXTENDED THE HOLD HARMLESS TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT DISTRICTS WHICH IS BASICALLY OFFERING DISTRICTS MORE MONEY FOR SERVING LAW STUDENTS. I WHICH IS THAT A COUNTER PURPOSE WITH THE PROPOSAL WE'VE PUT FORWARD WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SENATE NIELSEN. THANK YOU WHAT I HAVE DISK CONFESS I. FIND MYSELF WORD SYMPATHY WITH. A COLLEAGUE ON THE LEFT HERE. AND AND. MY COLLEAGUE ACROSS SERVICE OVER OBERNOLTE. REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S. PLAN. IT INSTILLS. SO PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATION. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND I WOULD CONCUR THAT. MY OPINION WOULD BE THAT THE MAY REVISE SOMEWHAT UNDERMINES AT. MAYBE NOT ENOUGH TO SAY NO TO THE ENTIRE. PROGRAM. TELL ME NOW AS FAR AS THE. SO WOULD YOU KIND OF CALL OF THE MIXED PERFORMANCE. MISS COST IT NOW. THE. PART WILL STILL BE FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. BASED. AND THEN IT THE OTHER THAN YOU. PROGRAM OUT. THE TENANTS FIFTY PERCENT. AND THEN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS THAT THE BALLOT OUR PROPOSAL IS SIXTY PERCENT WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED BASED ON ENROLLMENT SO SOMEWHERE TO HAVE TEA WHICH IS KIND OF THE BASE DOLLAR AMOUNTS THAT WE PROVIDE TO COMMITTEE COLLEGES. TWENTY PERCENT WOULD BE BASED ON ENROLLMENT OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND THE FINAL TWENTY PERCENT WOULD BE BASED ON PERFORMANCE OR STUDENT SUCCESS METRICS WHAT'S A BLENDED MODEL. ONE OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR A LONG TIME HAS BEEN. THAT. FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. AND. SCHOOLS. PUTTING TOGETHER CLASS IS SIMPLY THE. HELP PEOPLE ENROLLED. FOR LONG TIME I'VE OBJECTED TO THAT. CONCEPT. AND IT SEEMED LIKE TO ME THAT THIS ONLINE. IT'S A PLACE TO START. NOT JUST FOR THOSE PURPOSES BUT TO BROADEN. THE POPULATION. ANYWAY I THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE. BENEFICIAL THAN JUST INVENTING. SCHOOL BY SCHOOL. CLASSES TO GAIN FULL TIME EQUIVALENT. WHAT DROVE THE GOVERNOR'S? PASSION FOR THIS. THIS NEW APPROACH. WELL THERE'S WE'VE YOU THESE PROPOSALS IS REALLY COMPLIMENTARY TO ONE ANOTHER SO THE ONLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROPOSAL REALLY TARGETS A GROUP OF STUDENTS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE NOT BEEN SERVED. SOME OF THE INITIAL FEEDBACK WE HEARD IS THAT SOME DISTRICTS WORRIED AND IN EMPLOYMENT BASED FUNDING MODEL WE WERE POTENTIALLY DECREASING THEIR FUNDING BY SERVING THE STUDENTS IN AN ONLINE MANNER. BY HAVING A PERFORMANCE BASED MODEL YOU DON'T HAVE DISTRICTS HAVING THOSE DISAGREEMENTS INSTEAD YOU'RE FOCUSING DISTRICTS ON ACTUALLY AND MEETING THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. AND SO WE REALLY DO YOU VIEW THE ON LINE AND THE ENROLLMENTS. OR THE MOVE FROM A PURELY ENROLLMENT BASE MODEL AS COMPLEMENTARY MEASURES ON ADDITIONALLY I THINK THE ONLINE COLLEGE WOULD BE HELD TO THE SAME PERFORMANCE METRICS. WHERE WERE REALLY IT'S A SEISMIC SHIFT IN LOOKING AT? WITHIN THE COMMUNICABLE JUST THE MANY DIFFERENT MISSIONS THEY SERVE AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE FUNDING THEM. UP FOR MEETING THOSE GOALS OF THE STUDENTS BOTH IN THE ONLINE ENVIRONMENT AND AND THE BRICKS AND MORTAR SCHOOLS. SELECT. SIR MORE. COMMISSION CHAIR I JUST. IT WAS FOR THE SAKE OF MISS COSTED WANNA SAY THAT I DO SUPPORT THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND VOTED. FOR THAT'S I THINK MISTER CHAIR OUT WE NEED TO MAYBE. LOOK AT WHAT OUR STRATEGY WILL BE FOR STRUGGLING DISTRICTS AND I'M JUST WONDERING. IF FIVE MISS COSTA WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT. WHAT I THINK SIMILAR TO? ARE APPROACH ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE WE'VE. UTILIZE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL TO ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES. IN A THINK THIS DOES GET INTO THE ISSUE OF WITH AND THE NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE. WHAT'S ON GOING WHAT'S ONE TIME IN NATURE AND WHAT'S PROVIDE WHAT PROVIDES MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. WE PUT ADEQUATE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN OUR PROPOSAL HIGH IN DISCRETIONARY. RESOURCES I'M ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FUNDING FORMULA THIS IS REALLY FLEXIBLE DOLLARS BY HOLDING THEM HARMLESS IT GIVES THEM GREAT DISCRETION ON HOW TO FEND HOW TO SPEND THESE FUNDS. AND I THINK YOUR CHANCES ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE AS WELL SO I'M SURE HE'LL BE BACK. NEXT YEAR WITH THE SAME. RECOMMENDATION. THAT CORRECT. I'M NOT SURE I'M FOLLOWING YOUR QUESTION WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE ONLINE FUNDING PROPOSAL AND HOPE FOR ITS INCLUSION AND I THOUGHT I'D DROP ONLINE AND TALKING ABOUT YOUR AND FUNDING FORMULA YOUR FUNDING FORMULA. SO. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON STUDENT OUTCOMES AND I CONCUR WITH MY. COLLEAGUE FROM PAYMENT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M GONNA TAKE DECIDE PROVIDENT AND DIFFERENT DIRECTION. THE. HAVE YOU SHOULD IN ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ON IT AND. ON HIGHER ED TO RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY AND THE IN ON THIS NUMBER OUT THERE AND HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE DEGREES. DO YOU HAVE A. DID YOU WITH INCOME INEQUALITY. WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW WHAT HOW CAN WE HELP PEOPLE GET JOBS HOW CAN YOU GET. DEVELOP THE MIDDLE CLASS. HOW DO WE GET THE SKILLS WE NEED? AND THE WORLD ECONOMY. SO ALL THESE THINGS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY. AND I THINK OUR. CONCEPT OF. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BE IN A PLACE TO GET IN A A. AND TRANSFERRING TO WAS CE AS YOU'D BEGIN TO BE A OR B. S.. BECAUSE WHEN I ATTENDED A COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE MAJORITY OF US DID THAT. BUT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT IT WHAT'S. ILLEGAL BY WHAT'S PERCENT OF. GRADUATES. OR ATTENDEES OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED TO ISSUES YOU ARE YOU SAY. TO GET HIRED TO GET A BACHELORS DEGREE. WHEN RUNNING RATHER. I DON'T THINK THAT NUMBER BUT IT'S LESS THAN HALF OF STUDENT I WAS GONNA SAY IS LESSEN TWENTY PERCENT. AND SO IT'S NOT A BIG GROUP. WHICH WAS IT THE SAME ONE I TENDED OF COMMUNICABLE JUNE NINETEEN SIXTY NINE. SO SO THIS CHANGED. AS I WAS TOLD THE STORY SEVEN PERCENT. OKAY. SO THE. SO THERE'S A. AND THAT'S NOT A BAD THING. IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT NEEDS WITHIN SOCIETY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO I THINK WHAT THE CHANCES TRYING TO DO AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES NEW VISION IS FIGURING OUT. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES? WE'VE DONE A NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS AROUND THE STATE IN MY OWN DISTRICT AMERICA'S TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS GIVING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE TO WORK IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY BECAUSE. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES PARTYING WITH THE INDUSTRY TO GIVE THE NEEDS. TO THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW TECHNICIANS WORK IN PHARMACEUTICALS. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TO UC SAN DIEGO TO WORK IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY. SO THAT YOU MANY COLLEGE FILL THAT ROLE NOW I KNOW WE HAVE THE NUMBERS YOU MANY COLLEGES DOING IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SOME ARE GOOD AND SOME SOME OF MARK DOING SO WELL THIS VERY SMALL NUMBERS STUDENTS TAKING ADVANTAGE IN THE MODERN MONEY WE PUT INTO IT PROBABLY ISN'T GIVEN AS THE RATE OF RETURN WE WANT. BUT I THINK THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO REDESIGN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. SO. I. CHANGES REALLY TOUGH. AND SO IN THE DISCUSSION WE HAD AND IN EDUCATION. IT WAS ALWAYS A DISCUSSION ABOUT. AND I HAD A NUMBER OF THE. OF THE FACULTY. MEMBERS ATTEND COME TO MY OFFICE AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT BEING MEASURED FOR SUCCESS BEING EVALUATED. AND THE WHOLE DISCUSSION ARE YOU GONNA VALUE IT MEANS HOUSING TEACH CLASSES BECAUSE I'M TEACHING STUDENTS TO. PROBABLY WON'T A SUCCESSFUL IN HIGH SCHOOL SO THEY DIDN'T GO TO SEE ISSUE WOULD HOLD ME DIRE STAND SO THERE. TEACHERS ARE WONDERFUL PEOPLE BUT THEY DON'T LIKE TO BE EVALUATED YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT. ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE. SO. I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THE. TO THE. TO THE FACULTY BECAUSE ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. I THINK WE INDICATE MANY COLLEGES WE REALLY UNDER FUNDED IT. AND SO WE DON'T HAVE THAT VERY MANY FULL TIME FACULTY. HOW MANY FULL TIME FACULTY HAVE INCOMMUNICADO EDGES AVERAGE AND WE KNOW THAT ONE? I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC TOTAL BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ROUGHLY FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE FACULTY OR FULL TIME FACULTY WHEN WHEN DONE BY FDA OUT SO QUICKLY. ABOUT ANYTHING IS THAT I EITHER BUT OKAY BUT. MY POINT IS YOU USED TO BE WHAT I WOULD THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR IN A JUNIOR COLLEGE CALL THEN A LOT OF THE FACULTY OR FULL TIME AND THEY HAD OFFICE HOURS YOU COULD. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER PLACE IT WAS A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN IT IS TODAY. AND LIKE I SAID EARLIER THIS WOMAN IS BAD THIS IS A DIFFERENT ROLE THAT THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES ARE PLAYING WITH IN SOCIETY. SO I THINK. I'M SUPPORTIVE OF GOING BACK IN LOOKING AT. HOLDEN THIS WEEK HOLDEN THIS. DISCUSSION IN MEETING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE AND IF IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THE. NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO TRANSFER TO BERKELEY TO GET THE FRENCH LITERATURE DEGREE SO WE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS. WE NEED TO I LOVE BEING THEM UP HOURS AGO EITHER FRENCH YEAH AND IN THE FORTY NINTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THEM. BUT THE. SO I THINK THE WE NEED TO ALLOW THEM TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND GROW TO IT AND SO GIVEN THE TIME TO GO BACK AND RE. READ LOOK AT IT. WE DO KNOW. BACK OFF. THAT EDUCATION HIGHER EDUCATION IS A KEY COMPONENT FOR GOOD JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS. AND WE HAVE SOME REAL. INEQUALITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE GOTTA GET IT RIGHT AND I DON'T THINK THIS IS RIGHT AND YOU GOTTA GO BACK WORK ON A BIT MORE. I THINK BECAUSE THE CHANCES RIGHT GOT TO DO THIS. ALLOWED TO GO FORWARD IN AND FIGURE IT OUT. IN THIS CHANGE IS HARD. HELLO. I WOULD JUST NOT ON THE PERFORMANCE SIDE OF THE FUNDING FORMULA WE DO YOU TRY TO INCORPORATE THE MULTITUDE OF MISSIONS THAT THE COMMUNICATIVE SERVES THERE ARE. MEASURES FOR ADT ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER BUT CERTIFICATES AS WELL AND WE REALLY TRIED TO WAY THAT. TO YOUR EARLIER POINT KIMMY COLLEGES DO YOU SERVE AS A TRANSFER PATHWAY FOR SOME STUDENTS BUT FOR OTHER STUDENTS IT'S THE AND. AN AREA TO GET A CERTIFICATE WERE TO REACH OTHER EDUCATIONAL GOALS SO WE DID TRY TO INCORPORATE THAT IN THE AND STUDENT PERFORMANCE SECTION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE AYE ALLY TH HOPEFULLY THIS DISCUSSION OF THE TRANSPARENT. YOU KNOW THE KATIE TWELVE SYSTEM COULD DEVELOP A DASHBOARD WITH THERE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE I'D IMAGINE SOMETIME TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES SHOULD HAVE. THE SAME ACCOUNTABILITY SO PEOPLE LOOK AT SAY. YOU GET DEGREES OUT THE SCHOOL OR YOU GO TO AMERICA BECAUSE THEY NEED TO BE WORKED IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL SO. PEOPLE WILL HAVE. AN EXPECTATION OF WHAT'S GOING ON AT THAT. TOO MANY COLLEGES IN YUBA CITY COLLEGE MAY BE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN AMERICA'S DOMINICAL. AND THAT'S OKAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S RELATION BETWEEN THE COLLEGES EXACTLY THAT. A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. USED TO BE A JUNIOR COLLEGE THAT WHEN I TENDED NOW WE'LL CALL THAT. IT'S IS MUNITY COLLEGE I THINK THERE'S A REASON WE CHANGED THE NAME. ETCETERA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF YOU KNOW WITH THIS THESE FORMULAIC APPROACHES TO FUNDING IN FOR EXAMPLE K. THROUGH TWELVE WE REQUIRE. DISTRICTS TO HAVE A PLAN AND IN THE PLAN HAS CERTAIN REVIEW ELEMENTS IN. IN OF SUBJECT TO EVALUATING HAD DISTRICTS USED THE MONEY GIVEN THE. ATTENUATED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR STATE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN THESE VERY CAN BREEZE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THEM. IN THE STATE MAYBE I MISSED THIS BUT WHO DECIDES HOW THIS OF SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT MONEY IS SPENT IN. AND WHO. AND WHAT IS THE PROCESS FOR. ADJUSTING THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE MONEY IF SOMEONE WHO EVER THAT IS OR SOME GROUP DECIDES THAT IT ISN'T SPENT APPROPRIATELY. IS THAT A FAIR QUESTION. YEAH RIGHT SO KEY SO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OWN NOTE THAT I'M PART OF THE PROPOSAL AYE REQUIRES. AT THE LOCAL DISTRICTS WHO ADOPTED AND THE GOALS OUTLINED THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IT SO LAST SUMMER. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND BOARD OF GOVERNORS ADOPTED A VISION FOR SUCCESS THAT OUTLINE VERY SPECIFIC GOALS ON IMPROVING I STUDENT SUCCESS AT METRICS SO. AT THE PROPOSAL REQUIRES. LOCAL DISTRICTS TO INCORPORATE THOSE IN THEIR MASTER PLANS AND TO ALIGN THEIR BUDGETS WAITED AT THOSE MASTER PLANS AND THOSE SCHOOLS AND SPECIFY HOW THEY'RE MAKING PROGRESS ON. ON THE SPECIFIC METRICS I'D ON HOW TO SPEND THE FUNDS THAT STILL A LOCAL FLEXIBILITY BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE IS HAVE LOCALS REALLY A LINE. THEIR THEIR LOCAL GOALS WITH AT THE STATE WHITE HOUSE AND AT VARIOUS SUCCESS AREAS. WHERE AS YOU MAY KNOW I WASN'T I DIDN'T? DO NOT SIT ON A BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THAT HEARD ANY OF THESE CARE ISSUES AND SO. I'M SOMEWHAT UNFAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THE DETAIL BUT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS PART OF THIS PROCESS AND AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IS THERE SOME PLAN TO ACCUMULATE DATA TO TRY TO MATCH UP THE. DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT MONEY WITH EDUCATIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS THAT WHAT THE STUDENT SUCCESS DOZEN IS THE DATA AGGREGATED IN IS THE DATA THEN MADE AVAILABLE TO OF THE STATE'S CHANCES OFFICER TO US OR TO BOTH. TO EVALUATE WHETHER. THE SUPPLEMENTAL GRANT IS EFFECTIVE OR NOT AGE AS I THINK I AM. CLEAR THIS IS CURRENTLY A DEBATE THAT'S GOING ON IN THE K. THROUGH TWELVE ENVIRONMENT RIGHT NOW AS TO WHETHER. SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANTS OR THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO DISTRIBUTE MONEY AS OPPOSED TO THE BASE GRANT ITSELF IS THAT. THAT'S A QUESTION I THINK SOMEWHAT ONE DISTINCTION I WANT TO MAKE IT SEEM THE TWO SYSTEMS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ALISON I TALKED ABOUT. REALLY EARLY ON IS THE K. TWELVE THAT COMPULSORY. SYSTEM AND THIS OBVIOUSLY IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BECAUSE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. MECHANICALLY APPORTIONMENT GO THROUGH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO CALCULATE THE PERFORMANCE METRICS AS WELL AS SOME OF THE ENROLLMENT FACTORS THAT WE'VE BUILT INTO THE FUNDING FORMULA. AND SADAT HOW THE COLLEGES BUT ACTUALLY RECEIVED THE FUNDS THAT GOES THROUGH THE SAME MECHANIZATION IT DOES NOW JUST THE FACTORS THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WOULD DETERMINE ARE DIFFERENT. THAN JUST PURELY ENROLLMENTS OKAY. BECAUSE I MY ADDED IN TERMS OF COMPARING THE THINGS I THINK THIS IN THE THIS PROPOSAL HAS A LOT MORE FLEXIBILITY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL BECAUSE THAT. THERE ISN'T THE SAME REQUIREMENT THERE BE A CERTAIN PERCENT INCREASE IN SERVICES PROVIDED TO STUDENTS. THAT ARE PROUD THAT OUR SERVER LOW INCOME BUT I THINK THAT THEY DIEM PART WITH THE FORMULA IS% THAT THEY'RE. THEY'RE USING THAT SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING IT INSURERS THAT AS A RESPONSE TO HAVING A PERFORMANCE BASED COMPONENT YOU DON'T HAVE COLLEGES THAT ARE SAY. TRYING NOT TO SERVE LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO GET THEIR PERFORMANCE NUMBERS UP RIGHT WE WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGES HAVE A FISCAL INCENTIVE. DON'T HAVE A FISCAL INCENTIVES TO SORT OF. FOCUSED ON THE QUOTE UNQUOTE BEST STUDENTS SO THAT'S PART OF WHY THERE'S THAT THE POMONA COMPONENT ALSO I IN THE MAY REVISED THAT MISTRESSES PROPOSAL. IT ON THE PERFORMANCE SIDE PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR OUTCOMES FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOR SPECIFICALLY FOR PROGRAM RECIPIENTS. THAT'S INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE COLLEGE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE NOT SAYING EXACTLY HER SUPPOSED TO RUN THE PROGRAM WE'RE NOT DEFINING WHAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL SERVICE AND WHAT'S NOT NOTHING LIKE THAT. LIKE LIKE SOME ASPECTS OF A FEVER BUT WE ARE SAYING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT THAT THAT BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT COMPULSORY. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COLLEGES ARE NOT SORT OF LIKE. TRYING TO CHOOSING THE EASIEST TO SERVE STUDENTS I GOT I GOT AND I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND IT. HAS TO DO WITH THEM IT WAS JUST A BUT A LINE IN OUR. IN OUR ANALYSIS AND STAFF COME IT'S HAVING TO DO WITH THE UNDER THE PERFORMANCE METRIC ELEMENT TO THEM. MEASURING STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A. REGIONAL LIVING WAGE WITH ANY YEAR OF COMPLETING COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE METRICS AND. HAVING SPENT A LITTLE TIME THINKING ABOUT THIS IN ASKING. IN THE HIGHER ED AREA HOW THE C. ISSUES IN THE UC'S. MEASURE THEIR VALUE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO WERE STUDENTS IN WHAT THE STUDENTS GET OUT OF THEIR COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND. MOST STUDENTS OF COURSE ONE A GOOD PAYING JOB WHEN THEY WALK OUT THE DOOR. HOW DO WE MEASURE WHETHER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT? OBTAINS A REGIONAL LIVING WAGE. WITHIN A YEAR OF COMPLETING COMMUNITY COLLEGE. HAS THERE BEEN THAT'S QUESTION ONE AND THAT SORT OF A COMPOUND WHEN IS THERE SOME MECHANISM NOW THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED TO TIE AND. THE A DENTED T. OF A PARTICULAR STUDENT WITH SOMETHING COMING OUT OF THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT OR A. TAX RETURN. OF IT BE HAVING BEEN RECEIVED BY THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO. TIE IN A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER WITH THE STUDENT TO MEASURE WHAT THE WAGE THE STUDENT IS RECEIVING. IS THAT. FAIR QUESTION OVER CHRIS FERGUSON WITH FINANCE I THINK THAT'S A FAIR QUESTION UP WHAT IT THEY ARE DOING TODAY TO OBTAIN THAT INFORMATION IS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WORKS WITH. THE EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND IN PARTICULAR THEIR LABOR MARKET INFORMATION DIVISION WHO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION FROM. EMPLOYER SO THEY'RE ABLE TO DO A SOFT MATCH BETWEEN THE STUDENTS AND THE EMPLOYER DATA THAT'S BEING SUBMITTED TO HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE WAGES THAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE OBTAINING. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THAT THAT I WOULD ADD IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM DOES HAVE WHAT THEY CALL SALARIES ARE PER. AVAILABLE ONLINE ALL ON THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE WEBSITE MAY BELIEVE MANY DISTRICTS ALSO WENT TO THE SALARIES ARE FROM WHAT THAT ENABLES A STUDENT TO DO. IS TO LOOK AT A PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND HAVE A GENERAL UNDERSTANDING FROM THE START OF WHAT TYPE OF WAGE YOU COULD EXPECT FROM COMPLETING THAT PROGRAM. I UNDERSTAND I I HOPE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO. FINE TUNE THIS. PERFORMANCE METRICS SO WE ARE FRANKLY ABLE TO OBTAIN A VERY ACCURATE FAIRLY ACCURATE REPORT ON. WHETHER COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADUATES. RECEIVE A REGIONAL LIVING WAGE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT EXPANDED BOTH TO THE C. ISSUE IN THE UC BECAUSE I THINK THE FOLKS THAT RUN THOSE INSTITUTIONS. HAVE ARE AN OBLIGATION TO THE TAXPAYERS BUT CERTAINLY AN OBLIGATION TO THEIR CUSTOMERS WHO WERE STUDENTS TO DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE ADDED. OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE AND AND THE WAY I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE CURRENTLY DOING THIS FOR THE MOST PART. IS ANECDOTAL INFORMATION THROUGH ALUMNI ASSOCIATIONS WHICH. GIVEN THE FACT THAT. WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN A. SIZEABLE GENERAL FUND BUDGET WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO SKIN THAT CAT SO GOOD LUCK TO YOU ON THIS THANK YOU. THEY MISTER. THANK YOU. SENATOR DOLE'S. MASTER PLAN HAS BEEN MENTIONED HERE. I THINK IT WAS A MORE NARROW. TAILORED AFTER THE AT THAT MASTER PLAN I THINK FINANCE WAS SUGGESTING THAT WHAT I'M GOING TO THE REFER TO. AND THAT IS A MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. THAT. WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. PAT BROWN. AND REVISED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN I WOULD ARGUE IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT MASTER PLAN. SOME THINGS AREN'T THOUGH AND THAT WOULD BE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECOMING FOUR YEAR DEGREE OFFERING COLLEGES. I AM VERY RESISTANT TO THAT. BUT WE'VE THE. WE'D WE'VE HAD THAT THE WHOLE REASON FOR THE REVIEW OF ASPEN WAS IN EIGHTY THREE WAS BECAUSE OF. THE CREEPING. THE. SO I GUESS THE OTHER DIFFERENT. THE INSTITUTIONS THE. CS YOU. WAS WANTING TO GET INTO DR ED EDUCATION. AND YOU SEE INTO. TEACHING TEACHERS LET'S PUT VERY SIMPLY ORIGINALLY THE CSU SYSTEM WAS CALLED TEACHERS COLLEGE. WELL THAT WAS THAT CONFUSION. I FELT IF WE LEFT TO GO IT WOULD RAIN. STRONG AND. REALLY HEART HURT HIGHER EDUCATION O THE MASTER PLAN HAS BEEN A GOOD. TAYLOR. AND THE DIRECTION IN THE FUTURE AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP THE MASTER PLAN. IN MY. THE ASSEMBLY OF VERSION OFFERS A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION NOW. THAT'S BASED ON WHAT THE APPORTIONMENT THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE IS THAT SIMPLY. GIVEN THAT IT IS A POOR AMOUNT OR IS BASED ON SOME CALCULATION. IS THERE SOME FULL TIME EQUIVALENT BASIS FOR THE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE. MILLION. SO THE ASSEMBLY AMOUNT BUT I THINK I'M TO THAT THE FIRST CALL WOULD BE TO ENSURE THAT. SINCE IT TO CREATE ANOTHER. TO. INSULATE THEM COLLEGES FROM DECLINING ENROLMENT IF THERE'S COMMITTEE DECLINING FUNDING OF THE RESULT OF AN WHEN WE ARE TO HAVE SOME OUT WHEN YOUR WHOLE THOMAS BUT TO PROVIDE FIRST. FURTHER IT'S LIKE THEM FROM REDUCTION VAN WHATEVER WOULD BE LEFT OVER WOULD BE UTILIZED TO PROVIDE AN ACROSS THE BOARD. PRESS T. INCREASE FOR APPORTIONMENT SO I THINK THAT THE THAT BASS INCREASE WOULD DEPEND ON HOW SERVE WHATTHE COST WOULD BE THAT FIRST COMPLEMENT. THAT DAHLE DISCRETIONARY REVENUE. BUT DISCRETIONARY FUNDING FOR COLLEGES YES OKAY BUT TO GET YOUR POINT SENATOR THAT. CLOSE TO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS IN THEIR VERSION AND WAS DERIVED WITHIN THE GUARANTEE FROM DENYING OUR FUNDING FORMULA PROVISION TO HOLD DISTRICTS. SO THEY REJECTED OUR PROPOSAL ON UTILIZED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER. ONTO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE MASTER PLAN I THINK THAT IS. THE GOOD POINTS TO PULL TOGETHER OUR PROPOSALS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS WELL AS GOING FORWARD ON THE AGENDA AND TALKING ABOUT YOU SEE IN CSU. A KEY COMPONENT OF THE STATE'S MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE IDEA OF ACCESS. AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE IDEA HIGHS AND SHOULD OF ALL OF OVERTIME IN THE BEGINNING WE TALKED ABOUT IT WITHIN THE. CONTEXT OF THE MASTER PLAN IT WAS REALLY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE GETTING INTO COLLEGE REPRESENTED THE DIVERSITY OF THE STATE ECONOMICALLY. ATHLETICALLY. I THINK WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THE THEME THROUGH ALL OUR BUDGET IS THAT ACCESS ALSO MEANS GRADUATING. ACCESS ISN'T JUST ABOUT ENROLLMENT IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT ELIGIBILITY IT'S ABOUT COMING OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE. ON A WITH A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE IN THE CASE OF THE CANYON ECOLOGISTS. AND HAVING ACCESS TO. HIGH WAGE JOB. ON THAT WILL HELP YOU LIVE AND WHAT'S AND. BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT AND HOUSING MARKET AND OTHER COSTS FOR CALIFORNIANS MRS COST I TOTALLY AGREE. WITH THAT. AND INDEED THAT HAS BEEN THE GOAL OF THE MASTER PLAN AND ONE OF THE ELEMENTS HAS BEEN MATRICULATION. YOU COULDN'T MOVE THROUGH THE DIFFERENT LEVELS MANY DO THAT. THANK YOU. IN OTHER QUESTIONS I I APOLOGIZE I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION GOING BACK TO. ISSUE SIX ON THE ONLINE PROGRAM. I KNOW THERE ARE. A. FINANCE PROPOSAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. AUGMENTATION FOR THE NEW ON MY COLLEGE COULD YOU WALK US THROUGH WHAT THAT IS FOR. SURE THERE'S A HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME IN TWENTY MILLION ON GOING THE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME IS TO SUPPORT THE START UP COST OF THE COLLEGE THIS MEANS PROCURING. AT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE TECHNOLOGY AT ESTABLISHING THE PROPHECIES AND ACCREDITATION PROCESS FOR THE COLLEGE. COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ON HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE YOU HIRING WHEN YOU SAY PROCURING TECHNOLOGY. YOU BUYING LIKE YOU KNOW SERVERS COMPUTERS SAW ME WHAT. THAT DOESN'T THAT ONE OF THE COSTS OF ACTUAL PLATFORM TO DELIVER THE CONTENT. ON. LOCAL CAN YOU COLLEGES HAVE A SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE TO THE ACTUALLY PROCURE ONE I'M TO DELIVER THE ONLINE CONTENTS ONTO STUDENTS. I THINK I GUESS IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS US LOOKING FOR A LITTLE MORE DETAIL THAN THAT BUT. ABSOLUTELY AND I WE WE DID PROVIDE A UP. WE HAVE ABOUT WHAT SHE WOULD BREAK BREAKDOWN AND WE PROVIDE THAT YOUR STAFF THAT INCLUDES A BREAKDOWN OF STAFF AND DEPICTS DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY PROCUREMENT. W. WONDERFUL THANK YOU. AND MEMBER PIE MADE THAT HUNDRED MILLION IS ALSO EXPECTED TO BE EXPENDED OVER A SEVEN YEAR PERIOD THANKS SO IDENTIFICATION. I. GOT IT SO IT'S NOT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. JUST GOT THANK YOU. OKAY. ARM. WE ARE NOW GOING TO ISSUE EIGHT UC AND CSU A MOMENT. THERE WE HAVE. MISTER CONSTANT TOURISTS FROM THE LA OVER THE NEXT. AND THEN MR FERGUSON. THANK YOU JASON CONCENTRA CELILO. THERE REALLY ARE FOUR ISSUES BEFORE YOU IN THIS ITEM ALTMARK TO REACH ISSUE I ONE OF THE TIME. AND BUT IN ALL THESE ISSUES RELATE TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT CSU AND YOU SEEN. THE FIRST ISSUE RELATES TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. I'M HERE THE HOUSES HAVE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES WITH REGARD TO CS YOU THERE ACTUALLY IDENTICAL THEY PROVIDE THE SAME VIDAK THE SAME LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL FUNDING. FOR YOU SEE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF SIMILARITIES WELL BOTH HOUSES ALSO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND PRO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF TOTAL SUPPORT. BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE HOUSES IS THE MIX OF FUNDS THAT GO TO PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT. SPECIFICALLY BOTH HOUSES PROVIDE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL FOR TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS TO GROW AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THAT YOU SEE. BOTH HOUSES ALSO PROVIDE SIX MILLION OF THAT BY REDIRECTING. FUNDS FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE BUDGET. THAT LEAVES ANOTHER FOURTEEN MILLION OF THAT FOURTEEN MILLION THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSES REDIRECTING ANOTHER NINE MILLION DOLLARS FROM CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT YOU SEE. AN PROVIDING FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW GENERAL FUND SUPPORT THE SENATE PROVIDES THE ENTIRE FOURTEEN MILLION IS IN GENERAL FUND SUPPORTS THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO HOUSES ON THIS FIRST ISSUE IS REALLY THAT NINE MILLION DOLLAR REDIRECTION. RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS ISSUE. OF THEY'VE RE DIRECTIONS AT THE UNIVERSITY PROPOSED WERE PART OF A WORKING GROUP THAT IT. STEP IF PIPPIN UP FORMED IN THIS AND THE FALL WITH A VERY ASIDE ADMINISTRATIVE LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AND WE THINK YOU COULD USE THOSE RE DIRECTIONS FIRST TO FIND IN WYOMING GROWTH BEFORE PROVIDING A GENERAL FUND SUPPORT. THE SECOND ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS A MOMENT GROWTH AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY EXCUSE ME THIS IS JUST FOR YOU SEE. HERE THE HOUSES DO DIFFER QUITE A BIT THEY PROVIDE THEY ADOPT DIFFERENT GROWTH AND PROVIDE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF SUPPORT SPECIFICALLY THE ASSEMBLY ADOPTS GROWTH OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION OF TWENTY EIGHT A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE SENATE PROVIDES ADOPTS GROWTH OF FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS PROVIDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A SUPPORT. THERE'S ALSO A DIFFERENT SPECIFICALLY IN THE IN THE TYPES OF STUDENTS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE SUPPORTING. OF THE ASSEMBLY DOESN'T SPECIFY THE NECKS OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS THE SENATE DOES SPECIFY THAT THOSE FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS WOULD BE FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ONLY. ON THIS ISSUE WE RECOMMEND A BIT OF A COMPROMISE A TAKING THE SENATE LEVEL OF STUDENTS AT THE FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS BUT TAKING THE ASSEMBLY APPROACH OF NOT OF SPECIFYING THE MIX OF UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. EVERYTHING HERE AS FOLLOWS. IT LOOKING OUT OVER FOR BEEN PROJECTIONS OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES UP PERSONAL GRADUATES ARE PROJECTED TO GROW VERY MUCH IN FACT THEIR SPECTRA DECLINE IN THAT YEAR VERY SLIGHTLY. I'M BECAUSE OF THAT WE THINK THAT. SOME LOWER GROWTH JUST AS IT IS JUSTIFIED. NO THAT'S SAID ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHABAS AND. SEVERAL OTHER VIEW HAVE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S THIS MASTER PLAN AND PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. IS EXHORT OF CONSIDERS A MOMENT ALL THREE SEGMENTS AND RELIES VERY HEAVILY ON THE TRANSFER FUNCTION AND HISTORICALLY STUDENTS TO OF A DON'T DON'T MAKE IT TO YOU SINCE YOUR ISSUE AS FRESHMEN. SO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE TRANSFER PROCESS. WE THINK THAT STILL THERE STILL RATIONALE THERE ON. COSTS ARE STILL A LOWER AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND SO PROVIDE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TRANSFER TO UC AND CSU. AND FURTHERMORE IN RECENT YEARS AND MOMENT COMMUTER COLLEGES AS BELOW SORT OF ITS PEAK YEARS SO WE THINK THERE'S SOME. ADDITIONAL CAPACITY A COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO OBSERVE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. BUT THAT'S A THAT IS A KEY CONSIDERATION FOR U. S. REFACTORING YOUR HOME DECISIONS HOW THAT WILL IMPACT TO TAKE IT ROAMING ACROSS ALL THREE SEGMENTS. AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO CONTINUE TO RELY HEAVILY ON THE TRANSFER FUNCTION OR TO PROVIDE MORE. ARE SLOTS FOR FRESHMAN STUDENTS. OUR THINKING IT ON A NOT SPECIFYING THE MIX OF UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE STUDENTS IS JUST THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY SOME FLEXIBILITY TADMOR GRADUATE STUDENTS. AND. SUPPORT MORE AYE TEACHING ASSISTANTS TO SUPPORT THE UNDERGRADUATE. INSTRUCTION OF THE OF THE GROSS. THE THIRD ISSUE IS FUNDING FOR OVER BUDGET ENROLLMENT THIS IS FUNDING SPECIFICALLY TO ADD A ADDRESS. AND WOMAN LEVELS THAT HAVE EXCEEDED A FUNDED TARGETS IN THE STATE BUDGET IN RECENT YEARS SPOT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND THE ASSEMBLY PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE. I'M SORRY THE CENTER PROVIDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR THAT PURPOSE THE SIMPLY PROVIDES HALF THAT AMOUNT TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION. WE RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY AMOUNT ON THIS CASE A TWELVE AND A HALF MILLION OUR OUR THINKING IS THAT. ALL THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOUSES HAVE IN ADDITION TO THIS FUNDING ADOPTED NOTABLY LARGER BASED INCREASES IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE UNIVERSITY HAS ALSO. IDENTIFIED OTHER SAVINGS I CAN REDIRECT TOWARDS BUDGET AND IS ADOPTING NON RESIDENT TUITION INCREASES AND THESE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO COVER A VARIETY OF COSTS. AT THE UNIVERSITY INCLUDING COMPENSATION CRITICISM ROMAN GROWTH FOR THE UNIVERSITY ALSO HAS PLANS TO USE SOME OF THIS FUNDING AS WELL TO REDUCE STUDENT THE STUDENT FACULTY RATIO. WHICH WE UNDERSTAND TO BE A KICK REASON FOR THIS. ISSUE AS WELL SO WE THINK GIVEN ALL THOSE NOTABLE AUGMENTATIONS WHO EITHER THE LOWER AMOUNT IS JUSTIFIED IN THIS CASE. AND FINALLY ON NON RESIDENT ROLE MEANT THE SENATE ADOPTS A PLAYER ADOPT SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE. TO DIRECT YOU SEE TO DEVELOP A PLAN TO REDUCE. A NONRESIDENT ROMAN OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AS PART OF THE PLAN THE UNIVERSITY WOULD HAVE TO IDENTIFY FUND SOURCES TO COVER THE. A FOREGONE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT DECLINE ENROLLMENT. THE COLONEL YOU SEE DOES HAVE A POLICY THAT LIMITS NON RESIDENT ROLL MEANT. A FOR A SEVERAL CAMPUSES WERE NON RESIDENT MOMENTS NOTABLY HYATT KINDA LOCKS THE PROPORTIONS IN IN PLACE AND FOR SOME OF THE OTHER CAMPUSES THAT HAVE MUCH LOWER LEVELS OF NON RESIDENT MOMENT. PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO INCREASE THEIR PROPORTIONS. BUT THE SENATE A ROCK REPORT WOULD WOULD REQUIRE YOU TO DO IS DEVELOP A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY REQUIRES REDUCTIONS IN NON RESIDENT WOMAN FROM MOST OF THOSE CAMPUSES. SO THE KEY ISSUE BEFORE YOU IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH THE CURRENT POLICY OR WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER REDUCTIONS AND NON RESIDENT MOMENT. DO YOU THINK YOU'D LIKE TO ADOPT THE ESSENCE SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT A WE HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS ON ON. ON AND ADDING TO THE LANGUAGE TO GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT MIGHT HELP IMPROVE THE CONVERSATION. SURROUNDING WHETHER OR NOT TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH IS A NON RESIDENTS ARE TAKING UPS SEATS AWAY FROM RESIDENT STUDENTS WE WE SHARE THOSE. BOB SUGGESTIONS WITH STAFF AND WE WRITE WE UNDERSTAND THEY'RE STILL REVIEWING THAT SO. THAT'S ARE A RECOMMENDATION THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COST. THANK YOU THIS PACKAGE OBVIOUSLY WE GET INTO TRUE GENERAL FUND SO A LOT OF THESE DECISIONS WILL BE PREDICATED ON WHAT I REVENUES ARE ADOPTED AND WHAT GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS ARE ADOPTED AS PART OF THE FINAL BUDGET. WE WOULD KNOW. THAT BOTH HOUSES DID INCREASE I BASE FUNDING FOR BUT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY OBVIOUSLY THAT DOES CREATE ONGOING COST PRESSURES WITHIN THE GENERAL FUNDS. SECONDARILY WE WOULD KNOW. THAT AS WE MENTIONED AS I MENTIONED EARLIER VIEW ACCESS NOT ONLY. ENROLLMENT BY ACTUALLY GETTING OUT IN A TIMELY MANNER. OF BOTH YOU SEE IN CS YOU AS SUCH WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT ON. ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING PROVIDED TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM UP REMAIN FOCUS ON MEETING THE GOALS OF THEIR GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. REDUCING THE INITIATIVES. REACHING THE INITIATIVE SCHOOLS WILL HELP IMPROVE AS STUDENTS COMPLETING IN FOUR YEARS AND ADDITIONALLY WILL PROVIDE MORE VELOCITY IN THE THROUGH PUT. A WHICH WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR SOME ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WITHOUT WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. SO TOMORROW. IF YOU MISSED YOUR. AGAIN IT JUST JUST ON PAGE FORTY FOUR IT'S DIFFICULT TO TIE INTO PAGES TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY FIVE SO. MAYBE. AS REAP MOVE ALONG WITH HIM. WORK ON THAT BUT ON ON. ON PAGE. TWENTY FOUR IF THERE IS A RECOMMENDATION TO LINK. THE UC RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING TO. A BUDGET CONDITION BY THE ASSEMBLY AND. I I. WOULD SWEAR DISCUSS THAT A LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIR WAS EVEN MENTIONED TODAY. AND ONE OF MY EMAIL. THAT I BUT I GET FROM MY CAL MATTERS FROM A DAMN MARINE BUT. AT THIS IS WORK ON. BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR AND THE UC SYSTEM. AND. HAVE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN WAS ADOPTED AND IT'S BEEN PART OF THEIR. A REGULAR NEGOTIATIONS. MEET AND CONFER IT CETERA. SOME WILL CONCERNED BY TRYING TO. MODIFY THIS. THROUGH A BUDGET. ACT. WE KNOW THAT. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE. PORTABLE IT HELPFUL WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF. MOVEMENT AND EMPLOYMENT SO THAT FEATURES REALLY HELPFUL. HOW WE DO KNOW FROM HISTORY NOW THAT DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE? IT WE JUST HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR OLD SCHOOL DISTRICT SCISSOR. HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MEETING THESE INCREASED. PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS. RIGHT NOW. THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT OF UC EMPLOYEES I BELIEVE ARE UTILIZING THAT DC OPPORTUNITY I. I THINK THAT'S THE FUTURE WE SHOULDN'T BE HAPPY STRINGING. OUR INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION. BY FORCING MORE EXPENSIVE SOLUTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES ON THEM I THINK THAT SKINNER ONLY BACKFIRE ON US. AND WILL COME BACK TO HAUNT THIS. STATE BECAUSE ARE GONNA COME BACK AND SAY OKAY YOU'VE YOU MADE US DO THIS NOW YOU PAY FOR IT BECAUSE. WE MADE OUR MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE CHANGING THEM SO I SEE IT AS A. AS MAY BE UP FISCAL TRAIN WRECK ON THE ON THE HORIZON AND MAYBE EVEN AN INSULT TO. GOVERNOR BROWN FOR ALL OF THE HARD WORK THAT HE'S READY INVESTED. IN FACT. THE LAST TIME I WAS WITH THE GOVERNOR AT AND AT A DINNER HE HAD TWO MAJOR CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE ONE BEING. CLIMATE CHANGE THE OTHER BEING THE PENSION PLAN. CONCERNS IN THE UNFUNDED. LIABILITIES SO I SEE THIS RECOMMENDATION IS IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND. AND MISTER CHAIR. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN REVIEWING THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS OF THE. UC SYSTEM THE TWENTY SIXTEEN. KAFFIR HAS AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT. OF ELEVEN BILLION WE JUST GOT THERE. JONES SEVENTEEN KAFFIR RECENTLY IT'S NOW DOWN TO A AT NINETEEN BILLION DEFICIT IN ITS GROWING. AND THE BUDGET. SUMMARY OR EXECUTIVE REPORT EVEN MENTIONED THAT. THE UC SYSTEM HAS NINETEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN UNFUNDED RETIREE MEDICAL THAT HAS NOT REPORTED. AS OF YET ON THE BALLOT SHEET THAT WILL BE COMING ON THIS NEXT MONTH. SO WHEN WE GET THE JUNE. THIRTY EIGHT TEAM KAFFIR FROM THE UC SYSTEM MIDDLE BE UPSIDE DOWN THIRTY EIGHT. BILLION DOLLARS. SO I I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE CAN BE CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE DO THE UC SYSTEM WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR. FORCING THEM TO HIRE CERTAIN. OUTSIDE VENDORS BUT AT THE SAME RATES THAT WE WOULD CHARGE IT IF THE IF YOU HAD. THE EMPLOYEES YOURSELVES WITH THAT'S NOT HELPING MANAGEMENT AT ALL SO I I THINK WE JUST NEED TO BE A LITTLE CAREFUL. ABOUT HOW WE TREAT. THIS SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK TO US START DEMANDING A LOT OF MONEY. AND. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SHARE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU. SO OUR MATERIALS DON'T. THE LA TWO MATERIALS IN THE. THEIR OVERVIEW. DR FIFTH DIFFERENCE FIRST THAT THE ASSEMBLY RETIREMENT PLAN FUNDING. DO YOU SEE. BUT THE TIME. MATERIALS ON. THE ISSUE EIGHT IN OUR BINDER DON'T REFERENCE IT. SO THE MIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT THE SENATE DID NOT TAKE ACTION. ON THE. BUT IT. ANY FUNDING TOWARDS THEIR RETIREMENT. SO WE DIDN'T OKAY. YOU KNOW I GUESS THAT I SHOULD UNDERSTAND THEN THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS NOT. HEARD THE ADMINISTRATION RATHER WAS NOT. RECOMMENDING ANY. PROP TWO FUNDING AROUND UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY. WE DON'T HAVE A PROPOSAL ON THAT I THAT WE HAVE A WILL SEE IN THE PAST UTILIZED PROP TWO FUNDING OF FOR YOU SEE RETIREMENT. AT ALSO KNOWN THIS IS KIND OF TECHNICAL ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S UTILIZING PROP TWO FUNDS IT'LL REALLY BE A CONFORMING ACTION DRIVEN OFF OF THE FINAL BUDGET PACKAGE IN THE REVENUES. THIS IS ON THE DEBT SIDE OF PROP TWO AND THERE WILL BE A TOTAL DERIVED FROM THAT THE REVENUE PACKAGE THAT'S ADOPTED. SO THERE THERE COULD BE SOME FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE. THAT WOULD JUST DEPEND ON WHAT THAT FINAL PACKAGE LOOKS LIKE I THINK YOU KNOW IT AS MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IN OUR PROPOSAL WE DID NOT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR THAT SO BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN THAT WE PUT FORWARD. WELL. I THE. MY MAIN CONCERN IS. I THINK IT'S WORTH IT FOR US TO DISCUSS WHETHER WE SHOULD DIRECT SOME PROP TWO FUNDING TOWARDS THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY BUT WHAT I. WOULD I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT IS UC'S PROPOSAL. TO HAVE SOME. TO EITHER HAVE A AND NEW POLICY YOUR NEW STAFF BEING ABLE TO. OPT OUT IN BE IN A FOR A WIND CAVE VERSUS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DEFINED SYSTEM PENSION. AND THE REASON I RAISE THAT IS BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. ALL OF OUR PENSION SYSTEMS. OUR BASED ON. THE. IT. THE FUNDS THAT ARE COMING IN. THAT ARE GONNA THEN PROVIDE OUT LONG TERM SECURITY AND AS SOON AS WE CREATE A PATHWAY FOR. EMPLOYEES NOT TO CONTRIBUTE. TOWARDS THAT DEFINED BENEFIT SYSTEM. THEN WE CREATE FURTHER INSTABILITY IN THE SYSTEM. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO SO. THEN I AM NOT SURE WHY I MEAN I CAN IMAGINE YOU SEE WANTS TO LESSEN THEIR. PENSION LIABILITIES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD INCREASE IT. BECAUSE YOU WOULD HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE NOT FINDING INTO THE SYSTEM. SO I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. WE QUICKLY. SEN CENTER MITCHELL THE THIRD A MORE. OKAY I WOULD JUST TO MAKE A CORRECTION BECAUSE A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN IS ONE WHERE YOU MAKE. YUR ANNUAL OR MONTHLY OR HOWEVER OFTEN YOU'RE PAID TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. AND THE RESULTS DEPEND ON THE. TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE INVEST RETURNS AND THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN PULL OUT. OUT WITH A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION HIRSCH YOUR YOUR YOUR EMPLOYER YOURSELF FOR FUNDING FOR SPECIFIC. BENEFIT IN THE FUTURE. AND IN IN ITS STILL EARMARKED TO YOUR ACTIVITIES SO WHETHER YOU PARTICIPATE IN A DB ARE DEFINED BENEFIT OR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION. HAS NO BEARING ON THE OVERALL FUNDING AT THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. OTHERWISE WE CALL IT A PONZI SCHEME THAT WERE THE CASE SO. I WOULD JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR COMPREHENSION SIR MITCHELL. THAT'S WHY TAKE SENATOR MORE LUCK WITH ME PLACE. FINDING. I GUESS THE QUESTION. OF THE ADMINISTRATION I HAVE TO ADMIT MY BAD I. THOUGHT THAT THE EIGHT POINT SIX WASN'T ASSEMBLY. POLICY I DID REALIZE THAT WAS IN THE MAY REVISE SO THE EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION FROM GENERAL FUND FROM THE YOU SEE AFTER THE PRESIDENT THAT'S BEEN REDIRECTED. CAN YOU GIVE ME A SENSE OF WHAT. HISTORICALLY A. THE OPPOSITE THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES REMINDER THE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. WHAT OTHERWISE BE DOING WITH THAT EIGHT POINT SIX THAT WILL NOW NOT HAPPEN? NOT THAT I RECALL THERE WERE SOME. IMPORTANT ELEMENTS AND SERVICES THAT WERE PROVIDED. THROUGH HER OFFICE THAT THAT. MIGHT NOW BE COMPROMISED IF YOU TO REMIND ME WHAT THEY ARE TO PROCEED CERTAINLY OF THE THE ROUGHLY EIGHT POINT SIX. ROUGHLY SIX MILLION OF THAT WAS FROM THERE JUST GENERAL OPERATING BUDGET. ANOTHER CHU AND A HALF MILLION I BELIEVE AND I DON'T RECALL THAT THE FOUR INITIATIVE VOTE SUPPORTED FOR PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVES. THAT IS WHAT THE REMAINING TWO AND A HALF MILLION WAS COVERING. BEYOND THAT THERE WERE SOME CAMPUS LEVEL FUNDS THAT WERE ALREADY AT CAMPUSES SUPPORTING. INITIATIVES AS WELL ARM AS WELL AS SOME LOTTERY FUNDING IN TOTAL WHICH IT COMES UP TO FIFTEEN MILLION BUT SPECIFICALLY. THE EIGHT POINT SIX WAS INCLUDED AS A TECHNICAL SHIP FROM U. COPD TO SUPPORT ENROLLMENT ACT SINCE I I GET WHAT THE SHIFTY AND MY CONCERN IS WHAT WILL NOW. NOW NO LONGER BE FUNDED IN THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AS A RESULT OF THAT SHIFTED SO YOU TALK ABOUT SOME INITIATIVES ARE THERE ANY WHAT I'M JUST PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON HOW MUCH OF THIS WAS A PROVISION IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET ACT THAT. A SEVENTEEN BUDGET ACT IN WHICH I WE WERE DIRECTED IN CONCERT WITH A ANALYST'S OFFICE I BELIEVE THEY PARTICIPATED IN OTHERS. COME TO LOOK AT THE. OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET AND TO IDENTIFY AREAS THAT COULD BE UTILIZED TO FUND ENROLLMENT GROWTH SO THIS PROPOSAL IS AN OUTGROWTH OF THAT WORK. I APPRECIATE THAT AND SOME STILL MY QUESTION IS. WHAT WORK FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT WILL NOW NOT HAPPEN? THANK YOU LIKE I COULD TAKE A STEP THE PUBLIC IS SOMETHING I. AS AND FOLLOW UP TO THE AUDIT. THAT HAD BEEN TAMPERED WITH THE BOARD OF REGENTS ACTUALLY HIRED LE FORMER STATE AUDITOR. AUDITOR SHOW BURKE AND. HE IDENTIFIED I BELIEVE. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS OF POTENTIAL COST SAVINGS IN. USE YOUR P. THAT ARM HE THOUGHT COULD COULD BE LOOKED AT. SO THAT THOSE WERE THINGS THAT WE WE SUPPORTED THE BOARD OF REGENTS TO TAKE A LOOK AT. I BELIEVE THE. THE BOARD IN THEIR LAST TO ME MEETING ARTICULATED ON. SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT COST SAVINGS TO HELP COVER. ENROLLMENT SO THEY DIDN'T NECESSARILY WANT IDENTIFIED OFFICE THE PRESIDENT PER SE BUT THE IDENTIFIED OTHER AREAS LIKE I DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE DETAILS BUT. BUT AGAIN. THE AUDITOR THAT THE BOARD OF REGENTS THEMSELVES HIRED HAD IDENTIFIED ABOUT PROJECTS POSSIBLY THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COST SAVINGS SPECIFIC OUR PROGRAMS. OKAY SO YOU KNOW YOU THINK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT IN YOU KNOW COST SAVINGS. YOU TAKE THEM SOMEPLACE SO YES CERTAINLY SO THERE THERE ARE FIVE INITIATIVES THAT WOULD BE REDIRECTED THOSE FIVE OR THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS. THE NEAREST PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTES. FUNDING FROM SCRIPTS FUNDING FROM MENTAL HEALTH TEACHING SUPPORT AND FROM THE MIND INSTITUTE. AND THE TOTALS. GENERALLY VERY BETWEEN ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTATION STEP OUT STATIONS DOWN TO AS LITTLE AS A HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR THE MIND INSTITUTE. INTERESTING THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR MARK. THANK YOU RICHARD JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION OUT ON PEAKS TWENTY FIVE. THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. DID HAS DECIDED TO ELIMINATE THE PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. AND. IF THE STATE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON ON NO FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. WITH ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE A GROWING HOMELESS AND MENTALLY ILL. POPULATION AND. WE'RE ONLY PRODUCING AN ORANGE COUNTY MAYBE NINE PSYCHIATRISTS A YEAR. IN AND AND I'M JUST WONDERING. WHY THE ASSEMBLY DECIDED TO ELIMINATE? THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM OF FIFTY FIVE MILLION. I DEFERRED TO THE ASSEMBLY ON THAT QUESTION SENATOR YES I KNOW. I'M SORRY SENATOR FIVE BUT I THOUGHT AS WELL AS A QUESTION I WANT MY FIFTY FIVE MILLION WHEN YOU GONNA GIVE IT TO ME. ALL. WOULD YOU LIKE IT'S A CASH OR CHARGE. IF THAT SENATOR MITCHELL HAS. SENATE IN SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY. I'M SORRY MISTER CURA FIFTY FIVE MILLION IN THE IN IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS A BALLOT FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ON PAGE. TWENTY FIVE BUT IN THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL IT TOTALLY ELIMINATES IT AND I. WOULD JUST HAVE A GROWING POPULATION WITH MENTAL ILLNESS OR THIS IS BECOMING MORE IDENTIFIED IN AND I JUST WAS CURIOUS. WHY THE ASSEMBLY? I DECIDED TO TAKE THAT MONEY OR WAS IT DIVERTED TO. THE FUN THIS INCENTIVE TO FOR THE THE UC RETIREMENT PLANNER. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON. THIS IT SAID THAT I AM TO THE AND THE HEALTH AGENDA HAPPY TO. DISCUSS IT THERE BIRD AS WITH ANY BUDGETARY AREA I THINK. YOU KNOW WE HAD WE DO HAVE THREE PROPOSALS THAT ARE FAIRLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. BUT THEY DO HAVE SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES AND THAT WAS JUST ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES THRUST. I GUESS I'LL WAIT THEN FURTHER HEALTH AGENDA TO GET IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. CENTER SKINNER. BOB. THANK YOU. NOW I WANTED TO JUST GET A LITTLE MORE INTO THE. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO ACTIONS ARE HOUSES TO ACTIONS REGARDING BOTH OVER IN ROMANCE. AND. THERE ARE BASE THEY SLOW FINDINGS THE SAME. ID LIKE THE SENATE'S. STRUCTURED IT TRIED. TO MOVE. YOU SEE AN TO INCREASING THE NUMBER OF IN STATE STUDENTS AND I LIKE THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED BECAUSE IT GIVES TIME SO THAT. WE CAN INTERACT AS TO WHAT THE. GREEN PARTLY YOU HAS INCREASED ITS RELIANCE ON THE OUT OF STATE STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY PAY A HIGHER. FEE AND AS STATE FUNDING WAS CUT BACK. IT WAS. PARTIALLY A MAKEUP OF THE CUT BACK IN STATE FUNDING. WE ARE DOING BETTER IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE PROVIDING BUT I LIKE THE APPROACH OF THE SENATE'S BECAUSE IT. GIVES THE ABILITY. OVER TIME TO FIGURE OUT VERY. HOW WE BOTH SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF? IN STATE STUDENTS. BUT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT. OUR. WE'RE PROVIDING THE SENATE ACTION IS PROVIDING. TWENTY FIVE MILLION. TO DEAL WITH THE OVER ENROLLMENT RIGHT NOW. AND THE ASSEMBLY WENT TO HAVE LESS THAN THAT. BUT THEN THE ASSEMBLY WENT FOUR. TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR NEXT YEAR. WHICH MIGHT BE OVER ENROLLMENT AND WE WENT. FOR WHAT IT SIMPLY SAID TWENTY FIVE MILLION ARE NOT QUITE SURE HOW AT THESE THINGS UP. I'M NOT CRITICIZING ASSEMBLY LOOK ONLY BUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS AND THEN SENATE ACTION IS FIVE MILLION FOR FIVE HUNDRED. MORE STUDENTS WHICH. ISN'T A. RIGHT NOW I GET IT THEY JUST DID IT ON OKAY BUT ANYWAY SO WERE WERE SUPPORTING FEWER IN THE ASSEMBLY WOULD RECOMMEND MORE BUT WE'RE GIVING MORE. IN IN THIS YEAR SO. SOMEBODY JUST SCRIBE WHAT THE NOT THE DIFFERENCE THAT'S OBVIOUS BUT WHAT THE. MOTIVATION OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES. WHAT IF I COULD TALK ABOUT THE MOTIVATION OF OUR OF OUR APPROACH AND AND WE? WERE ABLE TO. TALK TO YOU SEE AND. THEY WERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT OUR PUT NOTHING THAT THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR APPROACH BUT THEY. WERE OKAY WITH OUR APPROACH. BAY. OR ABLE TO WE HAVE TO COME TO AGREEMENT REGARDING THE TWELVE AND A HALF. MILLION FOR THE OLD FIRM ROLE MEANT IN THIS CURRENT YEAR WHERE WE WOULD PAY HAD TOLD AND HALF MILLION IT AND THEY WOULD COME UP WITH THE TOP HALF MILLION THROUGH. THROUGH THEIR UNIVERSITY EFFICIENCIES. SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR ACTION OF TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE MILLION IS THE NEED. BUT THE ASSEMBLY. I TOOK THE PRAYER THEY PREFERRED TO GO WITH. THEY WOULD OFFER TWELVE POINT FIVE IF YOU SEE WOULD HAVE BECOME OF THE OTHER CRACK WE WE AND YOURS YEARS PAST THAT HAS BEEN AN APPROACH THAT WE'VE ADOPTED IN BUDGET WHERE. WE'VE SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND THEN WE ENDED UP PAYING FOR FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS UNDER OBVIOUSLY. OUR APPROACH WAS DIFFERENT GOING INTO OUT YEARS. WHERE IT WAS WHERE WE BOTH? BOTH HOUSES. USE THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT NUMBER WHICH IS HOW DO YOU GET THE FIVE MILLION FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION FOR. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. OKAY. BUT THEN. SENATE OPTED TO GO WITH LESS. STUDENTS CALIFORNIA STUDENTS BURNED NINETEEN TWENTY. YEAH. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT CLOSING THIS TODAY. BUT. THERE MIGHT BE. SOME KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND HERE WHERE. IF. IF IN FACT YOU SEE CAN COVER. PORTION OF THE OVER ENROLLMENT FROM THIS YEAR. THEN. AND I KNOW AND. THE ADMINISTRATION WILL LOOK AT THIS DIFFERENCE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT THAT THEY WERE OFFERING UP ANY OF THIS GENERAL FUND TO BUT AT LEAST FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW. WE WOULD GET CLOSER TO THE SAME TYPE OF GENERAL FUND IF WE. IF WE WENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY SURPRISED JOHN THE CURRENT YEAR OVER ENROLLMENT AND. THEN THE ASSEMBLY SUPERCHUNK THE FOLLOWING YEAR IT GETS IT CLOSER TO THE SAME. ALEXANDER MITCHELL HI I WAS JUST GONNA PROVIDE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE SENATE IT WILL YOU KNOW YOU YOU SEE ASK FOR THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND YET ONLY LONG. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THEY SEE THEIR NEED RIGHT RIGHT. RIGHT EXACTLY SO THAT IT WILL IT WILL DISTANCE AT THIS POINT MY PERSPECTIVE OF PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. A AFFORDABILITY IN WHETHER IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT. THAT THEY COME UP WITH THE TWELVE POINT FIVE IN. AS MY COLLEAGUE SAYS EFFICIENCY. WELL I THINK I'VE MENTIONED WE WE HAD TO BEFORE IT CLOSED WE HAD HAD DONE. DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU SEE IN THERE THEY HAD AGREED TO IT SO IT WASN'T IT WASN'T DONE. FORM KNOW SOMEONE SAY THAT. BUT I BUT I WOULD SAY AGAIN I THINK OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE. MAKING YOU KNOW JUST JUST AND YOU JUST FOR FOR CLARITY TECH YOU LIKE WERE SOMEWHAT SPLITTING HAIRS APPEAR ON THE DIET. I MEAN THE SENATE PROPOSAL IN THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL ARE VERY CLOSE NOW OBVIOUSLY WE ARE AND WE HAVE YOU KNOW. FAIRLY FAR PARTRELATIVE TO THIS PROPOSAL NOT IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET OVERALL BUDGET BUT. NO TO THIS PUZZLE BUT THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE WE. WE HAD IS IS THAT ARE ACTUALLY. ALMOST IDENTICAL IN TERMS OF THEIR PROPOSAL. WHAT TIME? TO CLARIFY. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE OVER ENROLLMENT COSTS ARE COVERED. HOWEVER WE DO IT AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HAVE MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS NEXT YEAR. SO I WAS. IN. BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR MOST FROM FOLKS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. IS THE FEELING THAT IN I DO NOT BLAME YOU SEE FOR THIS. BUT THAT WITH OUR MASTER PLAN WE HAVE A PROMISE THAT STUDENTS WHO ACHIEVED A CERTAIN LEVEL. WOULD BE GUARANTEED SLOT IN OUR. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM.
