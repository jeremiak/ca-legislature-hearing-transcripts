HYDROGEN MANY FAVORITE TOPICS I YOU- TRANSFER LAST WEEK YES GOOD MORNING TO ALLEN AND COMMIT MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SAID BILL SIX FORTY THREE I KNOW YOU HAVE A BUSY SCHEDULE WILL RIGHT THROUGH IT SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE. PASSED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN CONSULTATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO CREATE A WORKING GROUP TASKED WITH PREPARING AND ASSESSMENT OF THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MEET OUR STATE AIR POLLUTION GOALS. BEFORE GOING ANY FURTHER I WOULD LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS THAT WILL REMOVE. TWO HYDROGEN INDUSTRY MEMBERS ARE FROM THE WORKING GROUP. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS A LEAD AGENCY AND CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO HYDROGEN ANALYSIS MOREOVER THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IS WELL EQUIPPED WITH THE TOOLS AND EXPERTISE NEEDED TO CONVENE THIS WORKING GROUP AND PREPARE THIS IMPORTANT ASSESSMENT. HOWEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION S WHY IS THIS ASSESSMENT NEEDED HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS ARE AN IDEAL ALTERNATIVE FUEL SOLUTION TO ELECTRIFIED MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES. THESE AND THESE VEHICLES ARE NECESSARY COMPONENTS TO ACHIEVING CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY GOALS HOWEVER. THERE EXIST A KNOWLEDGE GAP RECOUP A REGARDING THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS- CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS THE STATE AGENCIES AND ENERGY UTILITIES LACKS SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE AMOUNT OF HYDROGEN FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE AND HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED. TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS SAYS BILL SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE WILL HELP BRIDGE THAT KNOWLEDGE GAP AND I'LL AND ALLOW CALIFORNIA TO ADEQUATELY PLAN AND IMPLEMENT HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS AS AN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCE. THIS BILL IS VITAL NO DOUBT. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT MISTER CHAIR THAT IT WILL BRIDGE THE GAP AS I'D MENTIONED ONCE AGAIN AND MORE SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL PASSED THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD INCOME IN CONSULTATION WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO CREATE A WORKING GROUP TASKED WITH PREPARING AN ASSESSMENT OF THE HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO MEET OUR STAGE. LUCIEN GOALS THE WORKING GROUP WILL FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS AROUND ASSESSING PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE DISPENSING AND DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT STORAGE EQUIPMENT SUPPORTING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SYNERGIES. ACROSS HYDROGEN SECTOR FOR EXAMPLE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRODUCTION STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FINALLY TO ENSURE TIMELY AND ACT AND CURRENT DATA. THE WORKING GROUP IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THEIR ASSESSMENT BY DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WITH THE INFORMATION FROM THE ASSESSMENT CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. END IT WITH ME ON THE TELEPHONE THIS TODAY I HAVE JIM SO SEEN BOARD PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATES HYDROGEN ALLIANCE AND RUXANDRA BIGELOW MAHDI- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WESTERN STATE CHARGES NOT ALLIANCE. BOTH ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND HELP ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED RICHER CAN I HAVE A CLARIFICATION UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR HIS IS GOING TO REMOVE THE TWO HYDROGEN INDUSTRY FOLKS IS THE PLAN RIGHT NOW ON THE BILL SO I HAVE CLARIFICATION ARE WE GOING TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE AB. EIGHT ANNUAL REPORT AND THE ADP TWO ONE SEVEN FIVE TO INCLUDE THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE FOLKS ARE WE STILL GOING WITH AN INDEPENDENT- PANEL. WE'RE GOOD WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE THIS ACROSS THE STATE AND I KNOW THAT THERE WE HAVE TWO BILLS ON ON THE RECORD BUT THEY DON'T GO AS FAR AS THIS BILL DOES TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHY IT'S NEEDED. AND HOW THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO BE COMPLETED NO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BUT THE BUT DID STAFF REPORTS INDICATED THAT WE CAN TAKE THOSE EXISTING STUDIES AND EXPAND THE ROLE OF THOSE WITH THE WITH THE FOLKS THAT ARE THERE. FOR SETTING UP A NEW- A NEW TAB PANEL THAT'S I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT WELL WHAT THE AMENDMENTS YES UNDERSTANDING IS- WE SO WE BECAUSE OF THIS CAR THREE TIME ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ISSUE ASSOCIATED THIS ITEM FOLKS THE PANEL YOU KNOW I'M TALKING A- RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE FUEL CELLS. TECHNOLOGY SO CPAS. PASS OUT IN AB EIGHT JANUARY IN AB TWO ONE SEVEN THIS IS ON PAGE SIX BEFORE WE GET TO THE HYDROGEN MEMBERS. AND SENATOR ONE PERTAINS TO THE PLUGIN THE OTHER WOULD CHANGE TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED WHICH THIS BILL GOES FURTHER THAT'S WHY IT'S NEEDED BECAUSE IT IT'LL OUT WILL HIT A WALL IF WE DON'T OPEN IT UP FOR THE ASSESSMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO GRANTED THERE'S TWO THERE BUT YOUR QUESTION IS CAN WE JUST GET BACK ONTO IT MY ANSWER I WOULD PREFER AND I THINK. THE INDUSTRY WOULD PREFER IF WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP THIS BILL A SEPARATE ON ITS OWN. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SIX FORTY THREE IS NEEDED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NOW- WE HAVE ONE SENATOR REPRESENTS LONG BEACH- THE SENATE PIZZERIA WE HAVE TRUCKS COMING IN WE HAVE PORCH THERE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THEM. SO THIS THIS STUDY IS VITAL TO GO ACROSS THE STATE TO FIND OUT WHERE WE STAND- TO MEET OUR GOALS AND AGAIN- IT WILL HAVE IT ON THE TABLE. BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE THING HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GO UNLESS WE TAKE A GOOD HARD LOOK AT IT. YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION FROM FROM THE COMMITTEE PERSPECTIVE- YOU KNOW WE DO AND I KNOW THE AUTHOR KNOWS THIS WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCY ISSUES WITH. THE BILL- YOU KNOW I MEAN I- HAVE C. E. SO THE- OF THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE- THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE. CURRENTLY MAKE UP ABOUT IT PERCENT OF. HIS ABS FIVE. SO YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT- THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY A- SO THE BILL FOR A R. B. THEN. YOU KNOW RULES WANTED TO BE A TASK FORCE FOR TO BE REFERRED OUT WHICH IS YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW NOW WE KNOW IT'S OUR SO THE COMMITTEE WOULD HONESTLY PREFER TO DO ONE OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS IT'S ON PAGE SIX NOW I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW. WE'RE WE'RE NOT THERE YET AND THEN THE BILL'S GOING TO KEEP MOVING- THE LADY GETS OUT TODAY OBVIOUSLY- AND BUT THIS IN THIS DISCUSSION WILL CONTINUE BUT TO BE HONEST I THINK IT'S OUR COMMITTEE'S PREFERENCE. THAT WE EITHER EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THE FINAL REPORT OR- UPDATE THE SCOPE OF THE EIGHTY EIGHT ANNUAL REPORT- TO REACH THE SAME TYPES OF GOALS THAT THE AUTHORS TRYING TO ACHIEVE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OKAY THAT'S A GOOD ONE THANK YOUNG. AND I DON'T SEE. YOU KNOW AYE SIR WOULD APPRECIATE THAT INDEED YOU CONTINUE WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND YOU KNOW WITH YOU.

THANK GOODNESS BEEN MARGINALIZED OR ABSENT FROM MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PLANNING OF THE TRANSITION OF OUR ENERGY SYSTEM TO A CARBON FREE ONE. AT THE SAME TIME HYDROGEN CONTINUES TO ADVANCE IN TRUCKING RAIL OFF ROAD AND MARINE SECTORS PROVIDING OVERLAPPING NEEDS THAT FURTHER IMPROVE HYDROGEN BUCHANON X. IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE TRANSITION CONSIDER ALL OPTIONS AT SCALE. FOR A FULL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TO ENSURE NOT ONLY CLIMATE EXPECTING JUNIOR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY.

CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCE AUTHORIZED OF HALF OF IN THE NEXT DECADE. AND UP TO SEVEN FEET BY THE END OF THE SENATE. I PERIODIC EVENTS LIKE COASTAL STORMS KING TIDES. FIVE IS A FAX THESE CHAIN COULD VERY WELL IN AND DAY LOCAL- COASTAL AREAS AND EVEN INLAND AREAS WREAKING HAVOC ON BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC FACILITIES. STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ONLY IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING FOR ANTICIPATING SEA LEVEL RISE- I MYSELF HAVE A BILL ON THIS- THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE COSTLY THE DAMAGE WILL BE IN THE ALLEY- RECOMMENDS MORE FINDING GREATER STATE REGIONAL LOCAL COLLABORATION BETTER INFORM PLANNING LAND USE DECISIONS. AND SO DOES THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE EMBODIED IN THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY TWO pTEMPTING SOMETIMES TO SEE AT SEA LEVEL RISES A- A FIRST WORLD PROBLEM FOR WEALTHY COASTAL ENCLAVES LIKE MALIBU HI&lt;c.cyan&gt;. BUT IN REALITY IT WILL&lt;/c&gt; DO MOST HARM TO THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD TO DRESS SECURITIES LIKE IMPERIAL BEACH CHULA VISTA. IN THE PRO TEM'S REGION PORT WHY NINI MARINA. IN OUR ON OUR CENTRAL COAST MIL PAETUS CRESCENT CITY. IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. I MEAN THE OTHER THING SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE MENTION IT'S TEMPTING TO SEE FIELD ARISES JUST ANOTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE.

PRICE SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THAT'S A MAX OF FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. STATEWIDE. ON SEA LEVEL RISE SO WELL THIS IS IT APPEARS TO BE S. LEVEL RISE BILL. THE LIMITING THE OF MONEY THAT CAN GO TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GRANTS- FOR THAT WORK FOR THAT WORKING AGAIN.

OF THIS PARTICULAR ONE I REMEMBER SO CLEARLY HE CAME FROM SOUTH CENTRAL LA WHERE I USED TO WORK AS A SOCIAL WORKER AND IT WAS SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO DO BUT HE SAID IT WAS REALLY THE UNDERTAKEN ENOUGH TIME TO REALLY LOOK AT HOW JUST GIVING AUTHORITY TO A ARE B. AND Q. M. D. R. DIDN'T PROVIDE BALLOTS FOR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY WERE FACING AND THOSE COMMUNITIES IT WAS VERY VERY ENLIGHTENING SO WITHOUT IOWA JUST LAY OFF TODAY AND THEN I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO OUR- MAYBE. YOU KNOW RAINY AND SOME OF IT AND- REALLY FOCUS ON BALANCE BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT I HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION SO WITH THAT THANK YOU MANAGER ALL RIGHT SO I'VE MOVED AUTHOR EVEN HEARD SOME CONCERNS WERE RAISED BY OPPOSITION INCLUDING- BOTH- FROM BUSINESS AND LABOR FOLKS YOU YOU. WANNA RESPOND ANY OF THEM AND MAYBE CLOSE. OKAY RIGHT NOW ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THING YOU SO BATES AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS YOU KNOW THIS IS I KNOW NOT AN EASY SUBJECT OF COURSE THIS IS BEEN TRIED BEFORE IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT HAVING COME FROM A DISTRICT WHERE THAT HAS BEEN HEAVILY IMPACTED BY STATIONARY SOURCES AT A COMMITTEE BOARD WHILE THEY DO AN AMAZING JOB OVER 60% OF THEM ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND SO WE WANT TO BRING NEW PERSPECTIVES INCLUDING THE AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE WE GET THIS RIGHT IN HERE FROM EVERYBODY BUT- I THINK THE TIME IS NOW FOR US TO TURN THE PAGE AND HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE VOICES AT THE TABLE. I WANT TO THANK DR- DIRECTOR FOR THE LEN SUPERVISOR FLETCHER FOR LENDING THEIR VOICES IN SUPPORT- AND WILL CONTINUE I'M WORKING ON THIS BUT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY SOMEBODY'S BEEN MOVED BY THE AUTHOR AND- THE SECTOR PLEASE COLOR. ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. SB THREE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE. ALAN HI. ALAN I BATES. DALLY GONZALEZ FIVE. IT'S ALWAYS AYE SKINNER STERN BY CASKEY. OKAY WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON AYE I THINK YOU AND I SEE A CENTER LEYVA HAS HERE SO WOULD LOVE YOU TO PRESENT YOUR BILL. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO AND THEN WE'LL GO BACK TO. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT FEW BOTHER SO THANK YOU THE SENATE LABOR FOR COME ON DOWN. RIFIC THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS- AND I WISH I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE FOR SB THREE FORTY TWO. THAT'S A GREAT BILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING IT ON THE FLOOR. A MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR OUR HELP GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. FIRST MISTER CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. AND I BELIEVE YOU HELP MAKE IT A BETTER PROPOSAL. I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGES EIGHT AND NINE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO ESTABLISHES THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FLEET PURCHASING. ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WHICH WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING. AUTHORITY THIS BILL WILL IN CONSULTATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS. DESIGN NEW FINANCING TOOLS TO HELP OWNERS OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. PURCHASE CLEANER ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES. AS MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND BUSES. OR A MAJOR SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA. CONTRIBUTING TO POOR AIR QUALITY AND NEGATIVE RESPIRATORY HEALTH OUTCOMES. THESE LOCAL AIR EMISSIONS HURT THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED POPULATIONS. REPLACING THESE VEHICLES WITH ELECTRONIC ELECTRIC OR OTHER ZERO EMISSION ALTERNATIVES IS NEEDED TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION. THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORSENS CLIMATE CHANGE. CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT SOLUTION FOR FINANCING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. HAS BEEN VOUCHER OR GRANT PROGRAMS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE DIVERSE FINANCIAL NEEDS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE FLEET OWNERS. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE PUTS MORE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX. TRANSITIONING FLEET SHOULD BE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND EQUITABLE BOTH FOR THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE IN THE AREAS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DIESEL POLLUTION. EVER THE BUSINESS OWNERS WHO MANAGE THESE VEHICLES. THE INTENT OF THE BILLS TO GET THE STATE TO THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW WE CAN BEST LEVERAGE STATE FUNDS. BRING IN PRIVATE CAPITAL AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO MAXIMIZE THE ABILITY FOR FLEETS OF ALL SIZES. TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION OPTIONS. AFTER ALL THERE'S ONLY ONE AMAZON AND WE KNOW THEY LIKE TO TOUT. THAT THEY HAVE MANY ELECTRIC VEHICLES BUT NOT EVERYONE IS AS BIG AS AMAZON AND WE AS A STATE CAN DO A BETTER JOB. TO HELP SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZE COMPANIES. SB THREE SEVENTY TWO WILL ALSO CREATE A ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF THE POTENTIAL FINANCING GRANT OPTIONS AND OTHER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THAT IS AVAILABLE TO HELP OBTAIN FINANCING FOR THESE VEHICLES. BY CREATING MORE OPTIONS THAT MAXIMIZE CALIFORNIA'S AVAILABLE FUNDING AND PRIORITIZE DEPLOYMENT. AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES SB THREE SEVENTY TWO CAN ENSURE. THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE TRANSITIONS. IT TRANSITION AS A VIABLE EQUITABLE AND BENEFUL BENEFICIAL OPTION FOR DIFFERENT SIZES AND TYPES OF FLEETS IN COMMUNITIES. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AS MICHAEL COLEMAN WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND AND BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR. MEMBERS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ALRIGHT LET'S NOW GO TO MCGARRY. WHO TO SAW A LIMITED AS LAST WEEK.

MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE MARKET WHICH INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM SEMI TRUCKS AND DELIVERY VANS TWO CITY BUSES AND GARBAGE TRUCKS. IN TRANSMISSION IS IN TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. CONDITIONAL HAVE BEEN OUTSIDE IMPACT ON OUR STATE'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING LOCAL AIR POLLUTION IN THE HEATED HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT TRANSFORM THE MARKET YOU JUST BY USING PUBLIC FUNDS IT IS TRYING TO BRING IN PRIVATE CAPITAL TO GENERATE LEVERAGE. SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN TO EIGHTEEN THREE Q. PRINTABLE. FIRST OF ITS EMPLOYEES PUBLIC FUNDS NEEDED NOTES BY CONCENTRATING PUBLIC CARBONE BOTH POPULATIONS. SECOND IT DEVELOPS PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN FINANCING OPTIONS FOR ALL THREE HI THIS BY CORRECTING THAT CALIFORNIA POLLUTION CONTROL FINANCING AUTHORITY. TO UTILIZE THEIR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIVATE BANKING INSTITUTION AND WITH THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. WE WILL BE A CRITICAL IMPLEMENTING PARTNER. AND THIRD. IT TARGETS A FULL SET OF RELEVANT TO THE FULLY TRANSITION I MEAN THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND HE ADMINISTRATING HMP AMENDED BY THE COMMITTEE. WILL ENABLE THAT INTER AGENCY COORDINATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF A ONE STOP SHOP WEBSITE. DONE RIGHT SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN TWO WILL DELIVER CRITICAL FOR AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH. DEUCE CLIMATE POLLUTION LOWERED LIFECYCLE COSTS FOR THE OPERATOR OF THE VEHICLE. IN CONCLUSION I'D LIKE TO THANK SENATOR LEYVA AND HER STOP IN THERE CLEAR VISION AND TIRELESS LEADERSHIP AND ENCOURAGE- I ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S GO OVER TO MR MCGOVERN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BILL MCGOVERN WITH THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE SEVENTY TWO CALIFORNIA IS ON THE VERGE OF THE TRANSFORMATIONAL CLEAN UP OF THE TRUCKING SECTOR WE CAN MOVE GOODS WITH OUT INFLICTING TOXIC DIESEL EXHAUST ON OUR COMMUNITIES. WE'RE STARTING TO HAVE EMPLOYEES OR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THAT TRANSITION AND TO COMPLEMENT THAT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE FINANCING TOOLS AVAILABLE PARTICULARLY FOR THE SMALLER WEEDS THAT THIS BILL WOULD FOCUS SUPPORT FOR. WERE ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT THE GOAL IS TO GET AT LEAST 75% OF THE SUPPORT TO UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT MOST OFTEN BEAR THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS FROM THE ADVERSE POLLUTION COMING FROM THE MOVEMENT OF GOODS. AND WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE PRIORITIZATION OF PORT TRUCKS WHERE WE HAVE A PARTICULAR CONCENTRATION OF EXHAUST IN A REPORT COMMUNITIES SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY FOR SB.

I SEE A VICE CHAIR. DILLON YES THANK YOU. SENESCHAL LEYVA A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS ON THE WAY I READ THE BILL YOU'RE NOT EXCLUDING THE OTHERS THEY OF TECHNOLOGIES SO IT'S NOT JUST ELECTRIC IF THAT WRAPPED BECAUSE THERE'S A QUESTION AND ANALYSIS ABOUT COUNCIL THAT'S GOOD AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING THAT WOULD JOB CAP AND TRADE MANY BE AVAILABLE. WOULD WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THIS ALSO YEAH SEEKING FUNDING FOR A LOT OF THIS IS WHERE I THINK WE HAVE START FOCUSING SO WE GET THE BEST OUR- BEST FOR A BUCK IF THEY SAY YES WE ARE LOOKING TO USE ALL RESOURCES SO CAP AND TRADE COULD BE PART OF IT THEIR PRIVATE FINANCING. ONE THING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS SOMETHING CALLED STACKING WHERE A COMPANY COULD USE ALL GET A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES I THINK THE ONE STOP SHOP IS WHAT MAKES THIS BILL SO UNIQUE AND HELPFUL BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT SO MANY COMPANIES THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HIRE SOMEONE TO FIND THIS. THIS WILL GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO FIND THE RESOURCES SO THAT THEY TOO CAN DO THE RIGHT THING. AND THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OUR- WE SHOULD THE BILL AND- I APPRECIATE GONZALEZ SAYS THE MOTION FOR THE BILL. AND WITH THAT LET YOU CLOSE CENTER. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NAY VOTE RATE HAS ACTUALLY PLEASE CALDERON.

SEND HIS BILL SB TWO EIGHTY NINE HE'S DELAYED PLEASE ANOTHER COMMITTEE. WE'LL GO WE'LL WE'LL START WITH YOU CENTER WIENER. GREAT TWO NINETY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN- I FIRST WANT TO START MISTER CHAIRMAN BY THANKING YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING VERY VERY HARD AND DILIGENTLY WITH US ON THIS BILL- AND DOGS IS EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES ARE VERY HELPFUL MOMENTS SO THANK YOU- COLLEAGUES ARE SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY OF THE CLIMATE CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WILL REQUIRE ALL UACS US BASED- COMPANIES BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. WITH OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE WHO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO REPORT THEIR FULL CARBON FOOTPRINT. BOB WITH THE TO CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD. AFTER THIS DISCLOSURE BOB KARP WILL BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE- TO PROVIDE AN EXCUSE ME A REPORT ON THESE ENTITIES TO WHICH WILL INCLUDE REASONABLE ESTIMATES ARE FOR THE LEVEL OF REDUCED EMISSIONS REQUIRED. SO THAT WE- IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE CORPORATIONS ALIGNED WITH THE ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS OF WARMING MAXIMUM- BEYOND PRE INDUSTRIAL LEVELS- THAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY TO AVOID A CLIMATE DISASTER. BY INCLUDING RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE- TO THAT LEVEL TO THE ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CELSIUS AS WELL AS REASONABLE ESTIMATES FOR TWENTY THIRTY AT TWENTY FORTY FIVE EMISSIONS LEVELS THE CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS ARE MET. SB TWO SIXTY IS A NECESSARY A BOLD STEP FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY HIT OUR CURRENT CLIMATE GOALS- BUT HAVE THE NECESSARY DATA AND INFORMATION TO SET NEW STANDARDS AND GOALS. ARE YOU CAN'T REGULATE WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW AND AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO CURB ITS EMISSIONS ACROSS SECTORS- WE HAVE- A WILL HAVE A CLEARER AND CLEARER IDEA OF WHAT WORK IS REMAINING AND WHAT ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO CONTINUE PROGRESS. HOWEVER THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR I CURRENTLY EMISSIONS REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE LIMITED TO LARGE POINT SOURCE THE MENTORS LEAVING OUT BASS SWATHS OF CORPORATE EMISSIONS SOME COMPANIES TO VOLUNTARILY REPORT VOLUNTARILY REPORT SOME OF THEIR EMISSIONS- SOME OF THEM BUT VERY FEW REPORT ALL OF THEIR EMISSIONS- BUT IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. TO BE CERTAIN OF REPORTS VALIDITY. MANY CORPORATION ONLY. PARTIAL CARBON FOOTPRINT REPORTS OF THE PUBLIC. WORKS SECTION OFF PARTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS TO DISPLAY TO THE PUBLIC WHILE NOT DISCLOSING OTHER PARTS THE LACK OF VERIFICATION AND UNIFORMITY ALLOWS FOR MANIPULATION AND FRANKLY MISREPRESENTATION OF DATA. AND CAN LEAD TO GREENWASHING. OUR CUSTOMERS AND POLICYMAKERS ARE LEFT WITH NO FURTHER INFORMATION BEYOND THE PUBLIC FACADE PUT OUT IN TERMS OF MARKETING BY A COMPANY BACKED EMISSIONS DISCLOSURE ANOTHER WITH A COMPANY COOPER TRADE ITSELF. AS BEING EXCEPTIONALLY GREEN. ONE BIG SWATHS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND SUPPLY CHAIN ARE INCREDIBLY CARBON INTENSIVE AND INCREDIBLY DAMAGING IN TERMS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. COMPANIES CONTINUE TO SET AND ACHIEVE AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS FOR THEMSELVES BUT WITHOUT FULL TRANSPARENCY. WITHOUT VERIFICATION OF THE DATA WITHOUT PUBLIC DOCUMENTATION THEIR EMISSIONS WITHOUT ALL THAT HOW CAN WE BE SURE THAT THEIR CLAIMS ARE ACCURATE. SB TWO SIXTY WILL ALLOW FOR THAT MUCH NEEDED TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING FULL DISCLOSURE. OF THREE SCOPES OF EMISSIONS COVERED FROM ALL COVERED ENTITIES. THIS MEANS COMPANIES MUST DISCLOSE DIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THEIR CORE OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES. EMISSIONS FROM THEIR ELECTRICITY AND OTHER POWER USAGE AN INDIRECT EMISSIONS FROM THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN WATER USAGE EMPLOYEE COMMUTES AND OTHER SOURCES. SHINING A LIGHT ON TO THE WORLD OF CORPORATE EMISSIONS REPORTING WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE CORRECTLY REPORTING WHAT MINIMAL WORK TO BE ALIGNED WITH US TO TWO SIXTY. PUBLIC SUPPOSED THAT THE COMPANIES THAT ARE USING UNREGULATED. EMISSIONS DISCLOSURES BAD FAITH THAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR WE'RE NOT TRYING FOR THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ALREADY DOING REPORTING CRITICISM ESTABLISH AREA. CARBON REPORTING- THIS BILL SHOULD NOT CREATE EXTRA WORK THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT AND WHAT. THEY'RE ALREADY DOING SHUFFLED AND- TO THIS. REPORTING THE FULL SCOPE OF A MEASURE HAS RECOGNIZED AS A NECESSITY FOR PROPERLY REDUCING EMISSIONS AND AS SUCH ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE HAVE DEVELOPED THE GREENHOUSE GAS PROTOCOLS TO HELP ENTITIES PROPERLY REPORT THE STANDARDS ARE OFTEN PAIRED ALONGSIDE SIMILAR GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS TARGETS ALTHOUGH SB TWO SIXTY WILL CERTAINLY PUSH MANY COMPANIES INTO NEW TERRITORY. THIS BILL WILL NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL RESURRECTING CARP TO CONSOLE AND CONSIDER THE GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS- THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED CARDS FOCUS HERE ONCE COMPANIES ARE IN COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING SHOULD BE TO ACTIVELY MAINTAIN AND UPDATE OUR PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE DETAILING THESE REPORTS. SB TWO SIXTY THROUGH CARP WILL ALLOW FOR CONSUMERS TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF THE HOUSEHOLD BRANDS AND BIG COMPANIES SAY NO. TO KNOW WHAT THE CARBON FOOTPRINT IS. IT WILL PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO MAKE A DECISION BETWEEN ONE PRODUCT AND ANOTHER AS MANUFACTURERS EMISSIONS WILL BE DISPLAYED AND EASILY VIEWED. ONLINE I MOST OF ALL ALLOW CONSUMERS TO SEE WHICH CORPORATIONS ARE ACTUALLY MAKING PROGRESS WHICH ARE PUTTING THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS AND WHICH ARE CAUSING CALIFORNIA TO LAGGED BEHIND EMISSION REDUCTIONS. SB TWO SIXTY IS THE NEXT NECESSARY STEP IN CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE ON CLIMATE TO ENSURE THE CORPORATE ACTORS IN OUR STATE- ARE ALIGNED AND WORKING AS DILIGENTLY AS WE NEED THEM TO BE. WE NO LONGER HAVE THE LUXURY OF TIME TO ALLOW CORPORATIONS TO WORK BEHIND AN OPAQUE CURTAIN EMITTING MORE AND MORE CARBON WHILE PROMISING US CHANGE- AND WHILE THE WORLD BURNS SB TWO SIXTY PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN AND SHINES A FLOODLIGHT. ON ANY AND ALL POTENTIAL BAD ACTORS AND ALSO THOSE THAT ARE DOING A GREAT JOB COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY ARE COUPON ON NARLIKAR CLIMATE ACTIVISTS AND NINTH GRADE STUDENTS AND SAN FRANCISCO AND KATHARINE OGDEN DIRECTOR. OF CARBON ACCOUNTABLE. ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO YOUR LEAVING THIS IS. THANK YOU COMMITTEE CHAIR ALLEN AND SENATORS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY I'M CATHERINE ACT INDIRECT AND DIRECT THREAT CARBON ACCOUNTABLE IT CROWD BECAUSE BONTA SB TWO SIXTY ALONG THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS AND PLANNED RIGHTS BAY AREA. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG AND PROUD HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND CLIMATE LEADERSHIP SB TWO SIXTY THE CRITICAL NEXT STEP THAT WILL DRIVE PRIVATE SECTOR GHG EMISSION REDUCTIONS. THAT ARE NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESIDENTS INCLUDING BY PARK COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. REQUIRING BILLION DOLLAR BUSINESSES BENEFITTING FROM THE LARGESSE OF CALIFORNIA TO MAKE DATA ABOUT THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE WILL ADDRESS THE CERES DATA GET GAPS THAT EXIST GIVEN SPOTTY AND NON PUBLIC VOLUNTARY REPORTING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH THE CODEPENDENT THAT RELIABLE COMPREHENSIVE DATA IS ESSENTIAL TOOL IN DRIVING SMART ACTION. INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S GHG EMISSIONS IS NO LONGER A NICE TO HAVE A CRITICAL COMPANY DATA THE CONSUMERS INVESTORS AND POLICY MAKERS NEED TO INFORM THEIR CHOICES- AND CLIMATE ACTIONS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT SB TWO SIXTEEN CONNOTATION BENEFITS FROM TWO DECADES OF EXPERIENCE DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY AND USING GLOBALLY RECOGNIZED STANDARDS LIKE THE GHG PROTOCOL TO CREATE POLITICAL CONDITIONS PROBE. THIS INCLUDES SUPPLY CHAIN EMISSIONS DATA WHICH ARE MORE THAN TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN OPERATIONAL MISSIONS MANY OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS ARE ALREADY DOING IT AND ARE EXPERIENCING STRONG RESULTS FROM THE ENGAGE WITH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. THE ACT INSURERS CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. HAVE ACCESS TO THIS CRITICAL INFORMATION WITH THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC FACING DIGITAL PLATFORM THAT WILL SHARE COLLECTED DATA INACCESSIBLE MANNER. SB TWO SIXTY ALSO DIRECTS THE STATE BOARD TO ISSUE A PUBLIC REPORT ON COMPANIES EMISSIONS TRAJECTORIES. IN A WAY THAT WILL CATALYZE SCIENCE BASED TARGETS ADDING IN LINE WITH THE ONE POINT FIVE TO THE FUTURE. WITH SB TWO SIXTY CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCELERATE GHG REDUCTIONS FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE IT'S RESIDENTS AND PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IT'S FOR THIS. REASON THAT WE REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO- KAPAN IN OUR THE CARCASS. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HELLO. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU I'M CLEAR. OKAY. HI MY NAME IS CALLED AN ARTICLE AND A HIGH SCHOOLER AND A NUMBER OF TONIGHT BAY AREA I'VE DIRECTED A LOT OF MY FOCUSED TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT THE FUTURE I WILL BE STEPPING INTO A BILLABLE ONE I KNOW THAT IN ORDER FOR MY GENERATION TO HAVE A LIVABLE FUTURE WE NEED TRANSPARENCY AND COORDINATED ACTION BETWEEN CORPORATIONS AND- CORPORATION. ARE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS TO GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER THE JOB OF COAL AND LARGE CORPORATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS LARGELY GOING LEFT TO THE CORPORATION FROM ABOUT. MANY LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE STEPPED UP AND MADE EFFORTS TO TRACK AND REDUCE THEIR MISSION. MANY HAVE NOT CURRENTLY WE ARE NOT SEEING THE NECESSARY ACCOUNTABILITY. THERE IS THE CORPORATIONS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MEASURE OR REDUCE THEIR EMISSIONS AT ALL. WE CAN ONLY UNIFORMLY ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ALL LARGE CORPORATIONS BY LEGALLY REQUIRING TRANSPARENCY AND ACTION. SB THREE SIXTY DOES EXACTLY THAT. PUBLIC RECORDING OF CORPORATE EMISSIONS WILL COURTNEY OUR CORE IN THE REDUCTION EFFORT. OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN A PROGRESSIVE INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF TRANSPARENCY AND ENACTMENT OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS AND CORPORATE EMISSIONS ACCORDING. TO GLOBAL REPORTING INITIATIVE AND CARBON DISCLOSURE PROJECT ESTABLISHED THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE LAST DECADE THE ENVIRONMENT SOCIAL AND GOVERNMENT GOVERNANCE MOVEMENT AMONG INVESTORS DROVE COMPLIANCE I'M SO SORRY ALL.

THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. PART LET'S BRING THE COMMITTEE BACK BUT SPRING THE BILL BACK TO COMMITTEE- THOUGHTS QUESTIONS ABOUT INVESTOR. A YEAR FOR A QUESTION FOR A SENATOR WIENER AND YOU INDICATED THAT THE BILL ONLY A PATH IMPACTS LARGEST OF BUSINESSES. HOWEVER I THINK ALL THE- REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALCHAMBER ACTUALLY RAISE THE ISSUE REGARDING THE MEDIUM AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE PART OF THE OF SUPPLY CHAIN OF THE BIGGER BUSINESSES AND- CAP AND TRADE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN DID BUILDING PROTECTIONS. OF SIMILAR NATURE FOR THE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES AND- HELLO R. HOW IS YOUR BILL OR ANY AMENDMENT SHOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE. PART TO PROTECT THE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES FROM THE IMPACTS OF THIS BILL COULD HAVE ON THEM BECAUSE THEIR WAY DOWN THE LINE AND YET. THE BIGGER A CORPORATE ENTITY IS GOING TO HAVE TO INCLUDE THEM IN THEIR REPORT. YET IT WAS JUST TO BE CLEAR IN TERMS OF THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE BILL BEING TO PUT TOGETHER ALL OF YOUR DATA FROM ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR OPERATIONS- TO WORK WITH TO HAVE THAT AUDITED. TO WORK WITH KERR. ON THOSE- THAT'S THE MECHANICS OF THE BILL THAT APPLIES IF IT REVENUE OF A BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE PER YEAR- YOU'RE CORRECT THAT IT COULD THAT IF- IF A BILLION PLUS DOLLAR CORPORATION IS WORKING. AS ONE OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE IS SMALLER THEY WILL HAVE TO COLLECT INFORMATION. FROM THAT SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATOR- BUT THAT SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATOR IF THEY'RE SMALLER DOES NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFS ARE PUTTING TOGETHER THEIR ENTIRE. FOOTPRINT OF BEING AUDITED IT CETERA- AND YOU KNOW THE ANYA REFERRING TO ITS SCOPE THREE- WHICH IS A SUPPLY CHAIN AMONG OTHER THINGS BUT PRIMARILY BECAUSE MY JAM. THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL IN THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY DID AN EXELLENT JOB- EXPLAINING WHY- IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE SCOPE THREE SUPPLY. CHAIN AT ALL- ASPECTS INCLUDE. A COMPANY CAN BASIC. CON OUT ITS CURRENT BOOK FOR. AND HAVE IT'S HIS CALL. ACTUALLY BE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COMPANY ITSELF LOOKS VERY PURE AND GREEN- BUT MEANWHILE THE RELYING ON SUPPLIERS. WHO ARE BURNING COAL OR DOING- WHATEVER- SO OBVIOUSLY WE WANT THE COMPANIES WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS- TO DO THAT BUT WE DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE BILL. I JUST THINK THE AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION ON A COUPLE OF THOSE ISSUES SO CENTER TO WINNER AND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WHERE YOU WANT TO GO AND VERY VERY IMPORTANT OBVIOUSLY CONCEPT BUT- I THINK IT NEEDS A LOT OF WORK IN TERMS OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT SHOULD BE THERE FOR THAT KIND OF DATA COLLECTION YOU'RE PUTTING ON THE BACKS OF. SMALL AND MEDIUM IN PARTICULAR SMALL BUSINESSES THAT THAT WILL BE PART OF AN OVERALL WILL BE IMPACTED BY ANY OVERALL- MISINFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED YOUR DATA THAT'S NOT ACCURATE. SO AB I DON'T THINK I CAN SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T THINK YOU'RE HEADED IN THE DIRECTION TRY TO GET THIS ALL INTO PLACE SO WE CAN MAKE SOME BETTER POLICY- AND I. APPRECIATE THAT I JUST WANNA- THAT YOU KNOW THIS BILL OF COURSE. DOESN'T REQUIRE THE COMPANIES. TO CHANGE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT REYES THOUGHT BACK TYPE OF REGULATION. OF A RECESSION YOU MUST DO THESE THINGS. IT SIMPLY INFORMATION AND DATA TRANSPARENCY ON OF COURSE IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC IDEAS. ABOUT ABOUT WAYS TO. HELP SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MIGHT BE PART OF. IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN. WE'RE ALWAYS WILLING TO TAKE A LOOK AT IDEAS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. THANK YOU. I SET OUT. WHEN THEY- SORRY SORRY FOR BEING INTO COMMITTEES AT THE SAME TIME I WANT TO MAKE SURE AND TALK ABOUT THE RIVER THIS IS A- THIS IS THE- CALCULATION OF. CORPORATE AND RIGHT SO THIS IS EMISSIONS A LOT A LOT SO I WANTED TO ASK THE- SENATOR. THE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT ME I THINK IS SOMETHING I WANTED SOME CLARIFICATION ON SO LET'S SAY THAT THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR- AMOUNT OF- CARBON THE MIRROR THEIR THEIR- THEIR- REPORTING. AND THEY HAVE SUPPLIERS THAT ARE SUPPLYING TO THEM. THEY'RE GONNA BE OBVIOUSLY PUSHING DOWN ON THOSE TO ASK THEM WHAT THEY'RE REPORTING ARE SO LET'S TAKE FOR EXAMPLE. MY COMPANY I PRODUCE SEED FOR OTHER FARMERS- AND IT GOES UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND NURSE. IT COULD BE. IT COULD GO TO ARCHER DANIEL MIDLANDS WHICH IS A BILLION DOLLAR. CORPORATION AND THEN THEY WOULD REQUIRE ME TO DO THIS WORK SO THAT THEY CAN REDO THE REPORTING AND SO THE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPACT EVERY BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DOES BUSINESS WITH. LARGE CORPORATIONS IS THAT CORRECT- IT DOES APPLY TO ANYONE IS PROVIDING ENERGY- TO ACCOMPANY- AND IT ALSO APPLIES TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND SO IT WOULD AFFECT OTHER COMPANIES THEY ON'T HAVE BUT THOSE COMPANIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT- THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED TO BE AUDITED THEY WOULDN'T BE THEY CAN BE PENALIZED BY CAR THAT WOULD ONLY BE THE COVERED BILLION DOLLAR PLUS ENTITIES- BUT OFFICES AND THESE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS. TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE HAVE TRANSPARENCY AND CAN KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT THE WORLD DOESN'T CONTINUE TO BURN UP. SO IT WOULD IMPACT MY BUSINESS I WOULD BE REQUIRED I MEAN THEY THEY ARE THEY SAY HEY IF YOU DON'T REPORT TO US THEN WE CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH YOU ANYMORE AND THEN. AND SO. I GUESS FOR ME IT'S THIS IS A- I THINK A- VERY LARGE- TAX OR- IF YOU WANNA CALL TAX IS STILL A REGULATE SOME HAS TO DO SOMETHING. CEMEX REPORT COST MONEY. AND RESOURCES NOT DO I. CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT ABSOLUTELY THAT'S WHY. I LOVE THIS COMMITTEE. BUT I THINK THAT. WE EAT WITH THE PLAN IS NEED TO COME UP WITH A WAY TO- YOU KNOW REALLY ANALYZE WHAT THAT WHAT'S THIS IS GONNA DO TO EVERY BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WORK FOR THE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY THERE'S NOT TOO MANY IN THIS DAY AND AGE THAT SOMEHOW DON'T GET TOUCHED BY. CORPORATIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER THAT ARE BILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES. SO I WANT TO GO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY- BUT I THINK THIS IS REALLY GOING TO IMPACT EVERY SINGLE BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF- THINGS THAT YOU KNOW OUR CALL TAXES OR OR THE CONVICT THEIR REGULATIONS WHICH REGULATION IS A TAX IF YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO PAY SOMEBODY TO GET THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU. SENATE AND HOUSE YEAH I AM A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ACTUALLY USED TO WORK FOR A CORPORATION WHO- FOLLOWED MUCH OF THESE GUIDELINES BEFORE THIS HAS BEEN ENACTED IN THIS IS JUST REPORTING AT THIS TIME AS YOU'RE MENTIONING THAT'S NOT A CHANGE IN THAT THE BUSINESS MODEL WHATSOEVER IT'S JUST A REPORTING MECHANISM TO- THE A. R. B. AND I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE WHAT IS CORPORATIONS- WILL- COME UP WITH YOU KNOW AND HOW THEY COULD. YOU KNOW CHANGE PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR- THIS SOME OF THE OPERATIONS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUSTAINABLE- I THINK. ON THE SUPPORT ON ON THE COMPANY THAT I WORKED FOR ME THEY HAD AT SUPPLIER SORT OF CODE OF CONDUCT BUT THEY REALLY TRIED THEIR BEST TO HELP THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN IT WASN'T- WE'RE NOT GOING TO WORK WITH YOU ANYMORE WAS REALLY TRYING TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM TO GET. INTO COMPLIANCE AND MAKE THEM MORE EFFICIENT AND BETTER- SO. MY PERSPECTIVE ON THAT BUT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU- YOU KNOW FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND HAPPY TO SUPPORT. OUR CENTER DO YOU WANT TO DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE WANTED ALSO TAKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY SOME OF OUR- COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES. YES ABSOLUTELY AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND ONE THING HERE- BONTA OKAY- FEDERAL ID. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES AND SENATOR I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I THINK IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THAT WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS NOT LIKE A BRAND NEW IDEA RIGHT THERE ARE COMPANIES BIG CORPORATIONS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS THEY MAY BE DOING IT AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE TRYING TO BRING IS CONSISTENCY SO THAT ONE DIFFERENT COMPANIES MIGHT REPORT THE FORMING CARBON FOOTPRINT WE KIND OF CONFIDENE THAT THEY'RE DOING IT. IN THE SAME WAY AND IT'S NOT BEING A GRITAR GREENWASHING BUT I- AND IN THIS IS US IN SOME OF THE MATERIALS FOR THE COMMITTEE- THERE IS. ALREADY SOME. CALL THE CDP'S SUPPLY CHAIN PROGRAM. WHICH HAS REPRESENTS- HUNDREDS FOUR MEMBER CORPORATIONS THAT ALREADY DO THIS WORK WITH THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN THAT INCLUDES. MICROSOFT OF WHICH I THINK I BELIEVE AS A COMPANY THAT SENATORS OFFICES WORKFORCE. A STANLEY BLACK AND DECKER WALMART. ALPHABET KELLOGG MCDONALD'S NIKE NORDSTROM TARGET AND COCA COLA WHO ARE ALL WORKING I THINK WITH A LOT OF THE DOWNSTREAM SMALLER BUSINESSES THAT YOU'RE- REFERRING TO ENSIGN IAGO IN HERE BUT OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE SUPPLYING- THESE LARGE CORPORATIONS. SO THEY'RE ALREADY DOING MASS AND I UNDERSTAND- YOU KNOW THE CONCERN ABOUT PUTTING IN. YOU KNOW AFFECTED BILLION OBLIGATION BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING UP TO WORK WITH. THEIR SUPPLIERS BUT IN THE END WE IT'S SO IMPORTANT COURT CORPORATE CARBON EMISSIONS. ARE NOT THE ONLY PIECE OF IT I DO A LOT OF WORKERS IN ON LAND USE AND HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. BUT CORPORATE EMISSIONS ARE A- BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. UNTIL-WE KNOW WHO'S EMITTING WHITE IT'S HARD TO KNOW. WHAT SMART. PUBLIC POLICY LOOKS LIKE AND SO I WITHOUT COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE. EVERYTHING I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. PART OF BILLS MOVE BY SECOND DOLLAR- SECTOR PLEASE CALL.

SB SEVEN TWO SIX IMPLEMENTS CRITICAL UPDATES AND REFORMS TO THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM WHICH CURRENTLY ALLOCATES CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO ENSURE INSTEAD OF DOLLARS ARE USED TO ADVANCE EQUITY IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. THESE CHANGES WILL HELP MAKE CLEANER VEHICLES ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS AND HELP CONVERT THE WORST POLLUTERS LIKE DIESEL POWERED TRUCKS THAT HAUL GOODS ACROSS CALIFORNIA FOR MY DISTRICT TO MANY OF OUR OTHER DISTRICTS- AND COLLEAGUES. ACROSS CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY AIR POLLUTION FROM GOODS MOVEMENT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS WE KNOW AND THROUGH A STUDY FROM THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS FOUND THAT ON AVERAGE AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO AND ASIAN CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPOSED TO DANGEROUS PARTICULATE MATTER EXHAUST. FAR MORE THAN OUR- CAUCASIAN COUNTERPARTS. IN ADDITION TO UPDATING THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM SB SEVEN TWO SIX ALSO REQUIRES THE GOVERNOR TO APPOINT A LEAD AGENCY TO OVERSEE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. AND REQUIRES CROSS AGENCY PLANNING TO BETTER ALIGN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION STRATEGIES WITH PRODUCTION GOALS INVESTMENT IN THESE PROJECTS AND EIGHT LEVEL HEADED APPROACH TO PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION IS NECESSARY TO PAVE THE WAY FORWARD. TO A BRIGHTER AND MORE CLEANER CAL CALIFORNIA TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY HAVE MERITED ALEXANDER REPRESENTING CAL START. AS WELL AS BILL MCGOVERN THE POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR I WANT TO THANK THEM BOTH AND AT THE- APPROPRIATE TIME RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I BILL ON SB SEVEN TWO SIX THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

I THINK CRITICAL MANUFACTURED THE- MENTION TECHNOLOGY AN ALTERNATE CALL PROVIDERS. AS WELL AS PRIVATE PRIVATE AND PUBLICLY AND MANY MORE. AND EASY TO CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM AND IS NOW NOW ON HOW BURLY BEEN A CRITICAL ELEMENT OF OUR- TRANSPORTATION CLIMATE PROGRAM. HOWEVER I THINK THAT WAS ESTABLISHED ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO WE PASSED MANY LANDMARK CLIMATE LIES. AND WE HAVE ADOPTED VERY AMBITIOUS. MANDATE FOR CLEAN VEHICLE. IN FACT VERY FOR THE- EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. CALLED THE REALLY MAKE SENSE TODAY NOT. BATCH YOU THAT GUY YOU. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE. EIGHT CURRENT GOAL. AS WELL AS RETURN TECHNO THE- AND MARKET. BECAUSE REALLY NEED TO INCREASE THE PACE OF OUR PROGRESS. AND IT ALSO CRITICAL AND MENTION TO ENSURE THAT THE AGENCIES WORK TOGETHER TO THE COURT THEIR SHARED GOALS AND TARGETS. SO THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND REALLY MORE NOW THAN EVER THE STATE NEEDS TO REACH ONE AND A HALF MILLION MIGHT BE EASY CHARTERED BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND WE NEED TO RAPIDLY SCALE UP INFRASTRUCTURE.

HAVE SENATOR FAVOR THANK YOU- TO. WE GO THANKS VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- THE ONLY WITH THE COAST FOR CLEAN AIR AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THAT COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR MOST OF OUR WORK IS DIRECTED AT CLEANING UP THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT ABOUT 80% OF OUR AIR POLLUTION COMES FROM TRANSPORTATION AND ABOUT 50% OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM TRANSPORTATION. WHEN YOU INCLUDE THE UPSTREAM EMISSIONS BUT WE ALSO SEE THERE A LOT OF INEQUITIES IN THE WAY THAT TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION AFFECTS DIFFERENT CALIFORNIANS IN FACT THERE RESOURCES BOARD FOUND THAT 45% OF THE AIR POLLUTION EXPOSURE DISPARITY FOR THE BLACK POPULATION WAS FROM MOBILE SOURCES OF YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. SO WE SUPPORT SB SEVEN TWENTY SIX WE STRONGLY AGREE WITH THIS PRIORITIZING REDUCTIONS IN AIR POLLUTION IN OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH ARE MOSTLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE EQUITY COMMITMENTS FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION MORE QUANTIFIABLE TO BRING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY TO THOSE AND ALSO TO UPDATE THE SCRAP AND REPLACE ENHANCE WHAT MODERNIZATION PROGRAM SO THAT THE REPLACEMENT VEHICLES WOULD ONLY BE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES SO WE APPRECIATE CENTER GONZALEZ CONSIDERING THOSE AMENDMENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH HER ON THOSE AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND- PRESENT YOUR FINAL BILL SENATOR- SB SEVEN SEVENTY SIX. MY LAST ONE NO WE APPRECIATE IT BECAUSE IT'S- ALLOWING US TO. GIVE THIRTY MINUTES OF OUR TIME OKAY GREAT ABSOLUTELY. NO PROBLEM THANK YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA SCARE AND MEMBERS AGAIN MY LAST BILL TODAY TO PRESENT IS SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX- WHICH WILL MAKE VARIOUS STATUTORY CHANGES TO ENHANCE THE STATE WATER BOARDS ABILITY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY IMPLEMENT THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ACT. WHICH WAS SB TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINETEEN OF COURSE THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNED INTO LAW SB TWO HUNDRED WHICH ANNUALLY DIRECTS ONE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TO SUCK FUND SAFE DRINKING WATER EFFORTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES HOWEVER CANNOT WAIT TEN YEARS FOR SAFER WATER ESPECIALLY NOW AS WE FACE ANOTHER PROBABLE DROUGHT WITH MANY VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS STILL SHELTERING IN PLACE FROM COVERED NINETEEN. THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS WORKED HARD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE LEGISLATURE'S VISION FOR THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM BUT IS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF CLARIFYING STATUTORY CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO QUICKLY EFFICIENTLY PROVIDE FUNDING. AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE COMMUNITIES IN NEED WITHOUT AN ANY UNNECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE DELAY. THESE AMBITIONS SEIZE INCLUDE CLARIFYING THAT PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS ARE ELIGIBLE FUNDING RECIPIENTS. AUTHORIZING THE BOARD TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS PROVIDING THE AUTHORITY TO ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY TO PURCHASE EMERGENCY BOTTLED WATER AND OTHER RESOURCES. BITING THE ABILITY TO QUICKLY SEND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS INTO A FAILING SYSTEM. TO RIGHT THE SHIP. THESE CLARIFYING CHANGES ARE BALANCED BY THE BILL'S PROVISIONS THAT RECASTING CONSOLIDATE THE BOARD'S ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT AND THE AUTHORITY TO FIND TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE'S FUNDS DO NOT FALL VICTIM TO FRAUD OR ABUSE. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX IS A THOUGHTFUL MEASURED APPROACH IN PROVIDING THE EFFICIENCIES THAT THE WATER BORDER NEED THAT THE WATER BOARD NEEDS TO BE NIMBLE AND EFFECTIVE IN GETTING. SB TWO HUNDRED FUNDS AND PROJECTS OUT THE DOOR TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY WE HAVE LESLIE LADEN THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AND ALSO IN THE ROOM FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS ON A MELINDA'S THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD I THINK THEM BOTH OR BEING HERE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR FIVE FOOT BOAT SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX. OKAY ALL RIGHT LET'S GO TO LET'S GO TO LESLIE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ MISTER CHAIR IN TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB TWO HUNDRED THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER ACT WHICH PROVIDES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO THE TOP PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS DELIVER SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND ASSIST WITH THE LONG TERM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FOR FAILING WATER SYSTEMS THAT'S THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD WORKS TO IMPLEMENT THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM THE BOARD HAS IDENTIFIED SEVERAL STATUTORY CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED TO HELP COMMUNITIES MORE QUICKLY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL ALIGN THE WATER BOARD'S DRINKING WATER AUTHORITIES WITH ITS WATER QUALITY AUTHORITIES IT ALLOWS THE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THAT WILL HELP THE BOARD TAKE QUICK ACTION IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT DATA IS READILY AVAILABLE AND IS IN KEEPING WITH OUR EXISTING AUTHORITIES. THE BILL ALSO EXTEND THE WATER BOARD'S AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE TECHNICAL REPORTS FROM STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. THIS WILL ENSURE SAFE DRINKING WATER AND SMOKE SYSTEMS IN COMMUNITIES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD'S CURRENT AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE THIS INFORMATION FROM LARGER PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL ALSO ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO ADDRESS EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT OCCUR AT FAILING WATER SYSTEMS. SPECIFICALLY THE BOARD WOULD BE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS WITHOUT A WRITTEN AGREEMENT IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE DRINKING WATER EMERGENCY. FOR EXAMPLE TO PROVIDE BOTTLED WATER. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZED THE BOARD TO MAKE ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO ENTITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO RECEIVE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUNDS. THE WATER BOARD GENERALLY MAKES PAYMENTS ON A REIMBURSEMENT BASIS HOWEVER THIS PROCESS CAN BE A FINANCIAL BURDEN PARTICULARLY ON DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE CASH FLOW UP FRONT. THIS WILL HELP SMALL COMMUNITIES ACCESS SAFE DRINKING WATER MORE QUICKLY. SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX ALSO INCLUDES AN EXEMPTION FROM CERTAIN STATE CONTRACTING REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO CLARIFY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM. THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT APPROPRIATED THE FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM AND PROVIDED THE BOARD WITH THIS EXEMPTION. SB TWO HUNDRED HOWEVER FAILED TO INCLUDE SUCH AN EXEMPTION THIS BILL WILL ALIGN EXEMPTIONS INCLUDED IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET ACT WITH THE INTENT OF SB TWO HUNDRED. FINALLY SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WILL PREVENT AND ADDRESS POTENTIAL FRAUD IN THE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER PROGRAM FUNDS. THESE PROVISIONS MERRICK CYSTIC OF SORTIES CURRENTLY EXERCISED BY THE BOARD FOR OTHER FUNDS AND ARE IMPORTANT TO HELP PREVENT MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS. PROTECT COMMUNITIES AND HELP ACHIEVE OUR SHARED CLEAN DRINKING WATER GOALS THANK YOU. FOR ALL RIGHT- WE'RE NOT GONNA WHO DOES NOT GONNA GO TO THE PHONE LINES TO SEE PEOPLE HAVE ADDED TO WANT TO SUPPORT. CORRECT GREAT BIG BUT I DON'T SEE ON THE TWENTY FOUR YEAR HERE. MODERATOR ANYONE ELSE IN THE FUNDS WHEN A VOICE SUPPORT FOR SB SEVEN THIRTY SIX. DURING SUPPORT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR SUPPORT WITH A LINE OF FORTY FOUR. THEY'RE NOT THERE. I HAVE NO OF FURTHER US SUPPORT QUEUE AT THIS TIME OKAY THANK YOU. I DON'T SEE ANYONE REGISTERED IN OPPOSITION- TO TESTIFY BUT- IF THERE'S ANYONE ON THE PHONE LINES FOR TWENTY FOUR YEAR HERE I DON'T SEE ONE IN PERSON AND I THE ROOMS- ANYONE WHO WANTS TO REGISTER OPPOSITION OR SAID OR OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL. ON THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN THEY OFFER OPPOSITION. AND ONE MOMENT ONE CUED UP WOULD HELP THEY DISAPPEARED WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION HERE AT THIS TIME. OKAY LET'S BRING THE ITEM TO THE COMMITTEE FOR DISCUSSION ANY THOUGHTS CONCERNS YES SENATE WITH CASKEY SIDE IF I MAY MISTER TORRES. SENATORS WITNESS A QUESTION ON- THE THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES ARE SYSTEMS ARE FAILING AND I WANT TO LOOK AT I THIS IS TAILORED TOWARDS HELPING THOSE WHO NEED A LITTLE MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- ECONOMIC TO SUCCEED OR TO CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE. I WANT TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMUNITY SERVER WAIT ON THEY ARE THEY ARE MANAGED A FIELD WATER SYSTEM THEY ARE THERE'S NO AMOUNT OF MONEY NO AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THEY CAN BE GIVEN TO THE THIS THIS AREA TO DO IT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS. SIXTEEN HOUSES ONE APARTMENT BUILDING WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE FILL SYSTEM WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE WITH THE TOOLS THAT THE WATER RESOURCE BOARD HOW DO WE- ADDRESS ITS ABANDONMENT I GUESS I GUESS IS A BETTER BECAUSE WE NEED WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT BUT IT IS. A TOOL THE THAT YOU TRY TO PROVIDE SAFE WATER MEANING SOMEBODY HAS TO MOVE TO A COMMUNITY THAT HAS IT VERSUS- WELL AS- IT IS. COMPLETELY AND RECOVER OUR WATER SYSTEM WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE MORTARBOARD. A LOT OF BOARD OF. HI FAILING WATER. SO THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN MANY OF HUNDRED THIS IS TRYING YOU KNOW IT'S GOING. YOUR AVAILABLE DATA. IF WE CAN THE MINISTER MAKE THEM OF THE POSITION AS PA. AND THEN THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT WE COULD DO AN ADMINISTRATIVE CONSOLIDATION IF THEY'RE TO REMOTE THAT WE CAN'T HOOK UP A PIPELINE AND PHYSICALLY CONSOLIDATE THEM WE CAN YOU KNOW OF OUT THEM TO A NUMBER OF SMALLER WATER SYSTEMS AND ADMINISTER THEM JOINTLY THROUGH OUR ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BRING EFFICIENCIES TO THE PROGRAMS. SO WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW USE ALL OF THOSE TOOLS WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE POINT OF THAT THAT YOU MENTION OF YOU KNOW FINDING A SYSTEMS THAT ABSOLUTELY CAN'T BE EFFICIENTLY- OPERATED SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE USE ALL THESE DIFFERENT TOOLS THAT WE HAVE. FOR ADMINISTRATIVELY CONSOLIDATING AND MAKING THEM AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE HELP AND THEN AT SOME POINT IN THE LONGER TERM- AND I'M SUPPORT THAT WE WOULD PROVIDE WOULD BE IN TOMORROW MARC AFFECTIVELY ADMINISTERED. THANK YOU MR I WAS A YEAH I SERVE WITH MY KING AND WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY VOTED IN TWENTY TWELVE TO STAB WISH- RIGHT A BASIC RIGHT TO WATER I THINK SOME PEOPLE MISINTERPRETED LIKE THOSE STATES THAT HAVE STAND YOUR OWN GROUND LIKE OKAY I'M HERE I'M LIVING HERE RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA'S COULD RUN- CLASS A WATER SYSTEM INTOMY HOUSE AND TOOK ME UP AND I'VE GOT I'VE GOT SAFE DRINKING WATER AND THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF. MISINFORMATION OUT THERE BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THESE FAILING SYSTEMS THAT SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN YEARS AGO FOR NOW AT THE RALLY I DON'T WANT TO BE OVER OVERSTATED BUT SOME OF THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN LONG LONG AGO SO I WILL MOVE THE BILL- HAVE BEEN A BIG. PLATE IN THIS CONSOLIDATION ARAB LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THE STATE WATER BOARD USED THE MUSCLE THAT'S PROVIDED HERE IN THE BILL TO ACTUALLY GET THIS FEELING SYSTEMS EITHER SHUT. DOWN OR CONSOLIDATED TRIP. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES I JUST WANT TO I TO THE BILL REALLY HITS SOME OF THINGS WERE AB- WHEN PASS THE SAFE DRINKING WATER BILL LAST YEAR I MEAN IT REALLY CLOSE WITH THE GAPS ON SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE MISSING AND ASKED IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPEDITING. AND I THINK THAT THAT SPAN- VERY GOOD OUT TO THIS WE'VE DONE THAT AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS JUST WILL TRANSPORTATION BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE PROJECTS WHERE THE MONEY THE CASH FLOW WASN'T THERE SO CAN THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ. I THINK IT'S A GOOD. I PREPARE TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU MA'AM I CERTIFICATE OKAY SO THE BILL A MOVE BY SARAH CASKEY. IF YOU LOOK CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I WANT TO THANK OUR WITNESSES FOR BEING HERE AGAIN LET'S A LOT IN FRONT OF A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE DIVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. AS WELL AS ON THE MELINDA'S THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALL RIGHT. SIR CONSOLE PLEASE KALRA. ITEM NUMBER TEN SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX BY SENATOR GONZALEZ THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED BUT FIRST HE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY. ALLEN HI I BATES HI EIGHT SIDE DALY. AND SALAS GONZALEZ I SKINNER STERN WHITE HOUSE STERN AYE. HI MY COUNTY. IT WAS MY. THAT'S PART THANK YOU. WINDOWS TEN NINETEEN YEAH YES. I KNOW THE LAST YEAR IS OKAY LET'S NOT GO TO OUR GUY CENTER STERN WHO HERE- WELCOME SENATOR HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE EIGHTY TO THE SIDE ELEVEN IN. OUR AGENDAS. IN A GREAT ROOM HERE OR THERE. YEAH THE YEAH YEAH OKAY. THANK YOU MISTER BURST PLEASE RE. SAN BILL FIVE EIGHTY TWO ALL TO. THIS BILL FOR ON THREE COMPONENTS OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM- WHEREAS I THINK WE'VE HAD A- ONE DIMENSIONAL STRATEGY TO SOME EXTENT TO THIS POINT. WHERE WE FOCUSED ON MITIGATION. AND THE REDUCTION DIRECTLY OF EMISSIONS. THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU ALL IS SO BIG- AND SO DAUNTING THAT SOMETIMES WE DON'T REALLY LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT IT'S JUST TOO OVERWHELMING TO THINK ABOUT SO LET ME TRY TO GROUND IT AND JUST THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THIS PAST YEAR AS OPPOSED TO THINKING OUT TO. TWENTY THIRTY OR TWENTY FIFTY OR WHAT THE WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE IN TWENTY ONE HUNDRED- HIT A HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES- THIS AST AUGUST. IN OUTSIDE OF LOS ANGELES. THE ENTIRE POWER GRID OF TEXAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE BASICALLY FROZE ALL THEIR FOSSILIZED FUEL INFRASTRUCTURE. THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY TWENTY FIVE ACRES IN THE STATE WERE ON FIRE. OVER FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS FROM WILDFIRES ALONE. A TESTIMONY DIRECTLY FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION ABOUT THE TOTAL COST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM UNABATED CLIMATE CHANGE- OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS THE T. WORD WAS USED- TO TALK ABOUT THE SCALE THIS IMPACT AND IT'S ABOUT REAL PEOPLE TO. FEMA'S VULNERABILITY INDEX CAME OUT THEY THEY FINALLY PUBLISHED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER NATIONAL RISK INDEX FOR THE ANALYZED WHO WOULD SUFFER FROM DISASTER. AND IT TURNS OUT IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SUFFERING FROM ALL THE OTHER DISASTERS WE'VE HAD WHETHER IT'S THE WILD FIRES OR THE PANDEMIC. SENIORS AND THE ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH POVERTY. PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIVE NEAR RESOURCES LIKE WHAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT HERE IN THE PAST BILL OF CLEAN WATER. ACCESS TO AIR CONDITIONING AND- AND COOLING AND HEATING. I'M THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL SUFFER MOST OF THE PREMISE OF THIS BILL IS THAT THE CURRENT TRAJECTORY OF CLIMATE DISASTER IS COMPLETELY UNSUSTAINABLE AND THEREFORE INHERENTLY UNJUST. AND THAT THE CURRENT TRACK WERE ON UNDER THE SB THIRTY TWO AB THREE NINETY EIGHT FRAMEWORK TO. REDUCE EMISSIONS 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY TWENTY THIRTY WHICH IS CURRENT LAW. IS SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT. THE E. U. ITSELF ADOPTED A 55% TARGET BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE U. K. IS ON TRACK 468% REDUCTION TARGET SO WE'RE ALREADY BEHIND OUR PARTNERS TO THE EAST. CONGRESS ITSELF IS LOOKING AT A BILL TO. TO REDUCE EMISSIONS ACTUALLY BEHIND THE U. S. CONGRESS AND I DON'T THINK OF CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT LEAVES FROM BEHIND. SO THIS BILL. INITIALLY SETS OUT THE AMBITIOUS BUT I BELIEVE QUITE ACHIEVABLE GOAL OF DOUBLING OUR EFFORTS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. BUT THE SECOND PREMISE. IS THAT VIRGIN THE PATH WE'RE ON IS TOWARDS RESTORATION. IT'S NOT SIMPLY TOWARDS MITIGATION THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO REVERSE IT AT THE CURRENT LEVEL OF EMISSIONS IN THE CURRENT LEVEL OF WARMING WHICH WILL LAST FOR CENTURIES IS GOING TO CAUSE SECTION JUST IS THAT THE ONLY JUST THING TO DO IS TO ACTUALLY TURN THINGS AROUND AND START TO REVERSE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO THAT. THE NOTION OF CLIMATE RESTORATION IS SOMETHING THAT IS NEW TO THIS LEGISLATURE AND IT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO SUBMIT FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS COMMITTEE IT'S A DIFFERENT WAY TO CONCEIVE OF JUSTICE IS THE LENS THROUGH WHICH WE ADVANCE CLIMATE ACTION- IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST ACCEPT THE STATUS QUO PEOPLE ARE GETTING HURT NOW. IN ORDER TO DO THAT THOUGH. OUR PATH ALSO HAS TO BE JUST INTO THE THIRD PIECE OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT RESILIENCE. ANGLING THE STATE'S EFFORTS ON BOLSTERING IN ADAPTING AND- HARDENING OUR WAY. THROUGH THIS CLIMB DISASTER ALSO HAS TO BE JUST WE HAVE LAWS ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW TO. SPEND GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS IN THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THOSE PEOPLE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HURT MOST FIRST. AND LIKEWISE WE SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME. WHEN IT COMES TO INVESTMENT IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESILIENCE TO GO TO THE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE FIRST. IT IS NO COINCIDENCE. THAT THE FEMALE VULNERABILITY INDEX THAT SAYS L. A. COUNTY IS THE MOST DANGEROUS PLACE TO LIVE IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. RISKIEST PLACE IN THE COUNTRY IT IS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE EQUITY MAPS TO LOOK AT FROM THIS PANDEMIC OVERLAP DIRECTLY WITH THAT VULNERABILITY INDEX. AND ALSO WITH THE POLLUTION INDEX FROM THE STATE ON THE CALENDAR VIRUS GREAT. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE HEARD. SO THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THE LEGISLATION AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK- ALL THE CONCEPTS OUTLINED IN IN IN YOUR- IN YOUR STAFF REPORT- WE- WERE SAYING YES TO- AND SPECIFICALLY. YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE NOTION THAT. THE CLIMATE RESTORATION PEACE SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS SOME KIND OF NEW OFFSET PROGRAM. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT CARBON REMOVAL SIMPLY AS A AS A WAY TO LESSEN THE PRESSURE ON THE MITIGATION SIDE. BECAUSE THE MITIGATION PIECES THERE IS OUR ACCOUNTABILITY MECHANISM TO ACTUALLY SAY NO NO WE'RE GOING TO BE DRIVING DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN COMMUNITIES. BUT THIS RESTORATION CONTACTS HOPEFULLY ADDS A NEW COMPONENT THAT GOES BEYOND NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IT SAYS WE ACTUALLY NEED A FRAMEWORK TO REMOVE CARBON. IN THE STATE AND SET OURSELVES ON A PATH PREINDUSTRIAL LEVELS. SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THAT AND ALSO THEIR CONCERN OF KEEPING THE INTEGRITY OF THE CURRENT. EMISSIONS REDUCTION PROGRAM SO CORDONING THOSE OFF AND FINING THOSE LINES I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO- COMMITTED TO THAT EFFORT AND WORKING WITH YOU ALL IN THAT ENDEAVOR- AND I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR TIME WE CAN GET INTO IT FURTHER BUT I. TO SHOW YOU THAT IT'S FEASIBLE AS OPPOSED TO JUST TELL YOU I WANTED TO HAVE OUR FIRST. WITNESS PROFESSOR DAN KAMAN. FROM UC BERKELEY WAS ALSO SCIENTISTS ON THE IPCC THAT DEVELOPED- THE PARIS AGREEMENT AND A LOT OF THE UNDERLYING SIGNS THERE. WHO HAS DONE THE MODELING- TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS FOR CALIFORNIA. I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM HIM AND ALSO THE SENIOR ATTORNEY ALEX JACKSON ENTERED THE C. IS YOUR MAIN WITNESSES AND I HOPE. IT COMPELS YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL. THANKS SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WILL GO TO. A PROFESSOR KAREN. I THINK WE ARE OPEN ON YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. WE DO A DRUM ROLL YOU THINK THEY MISSED THAT. THREE GOOD IDEA YOU ARE YOU AYE MUTE. BECAUSE WHICH IN CHATTANOOGA ALLEN JACKSON FIRST SOUTH JACKSON JACKSON WHAT. TWENTY NINE JANU. YEAH GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE DALLAS JACKSON ON BEHALF OF AN ORANGE THE- HELLO. MY LOOK AT THIS BILL IT'S CANADA VIRAL BECAUSE OF FATHER WHO WANTS HIS KIDS TO INHERIT A LITTLE PLANET. I THINK WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT YEARS THAT'S NOT HYPERBOLE. I'M A CHAIN HERE HAPPENINGS. DEVASTATING AND OUR CURRENT TARGETS ARE NOT CURRENTLY UP TO SNUFF. OUR OWN CLIMBING ASSESSMENTS. I'M FORECAST FIRING THAT WE GOING TO SEE TO THE MID CENTURY WE'RE SEEING IT TODAY- SO WE KNOW WE DO NOT TOLERATE OUR EFFORTS. TO COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED. FASHION AND THAT'S THIS BILL. THE AMBITION AND COMMITMENT NECESSARY. TO CONFRONT AND WHEN. THIS CRISIS AND IT DOES SO BY INTEGRATING THE THREE KEY COLORS AT A RESTAURANT TALK ABOUT MEDICATION RESTORATION AND RESILIENCE TOGETHER AT SCALE WE WILL CLOSE STOP COOPER BURST AND ALL THE OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. CRUCIALLY INVEST ACADEMICALLY IN THE COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK AND. MOST DESERVING KUMAR SOLUTION. TO BE CLEAR SO TARGETS NO SUCH FOR THE HARD WORKING THE CLINTON. WHICH IS SUCH. I DON'T WANT TO SAY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ON TRACK FOR OUR EXISTING TWENTY THREE TARGETS BUT IT MATTERS WHAT THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY COMMITS TO. ENSURE SENDING STRONGER TARGETS WILL HELP YOU CALIFORNIA ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF INNOVATION. BOTCHING JOBS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. IMPORTANT AREAS LIKE GREEN HYDROGEN. WE ALSO HAVE A HISTORY OF SETTING TARGET THAT LOOK AWFULLY DAUNTING DEBATE BUT IN HINDSIGHT LOOK ALMOST INEVITABLE. SB THIRTY TWO YOUR CALL IS GOING TO WRECK THE ECONOMY. INSTEAD WE MET THAT GOAL FOUR YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. ENTER PAVELIC WANTED THINGS GARDENING PAUL JUST GOT CLEANER. HOWEVER YOU CAN PORTANTINO THAT EVEN THE CURRENT BUILDUP OFGREENHOUSE GASES IN THE ATMOSPHERE IS UNSAFE THAT MEANS MEDICATION ALONE WON'T CUT IT WE MUST ALSO RAPIDLY BEGIN DRAWING DOWN GREENHOUSE GASES FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. BUT IT MUST BE A BOTH AND NOT AN EITHER OR- CRUCIALLY BY LEAKING CARBON REMOVAL TARGETS TO XCELERATED MITIGATION TRAJECTORY SB FIVE EACH YOU. WILL ENSURE THAT COVER A LITTLE BIT NOT TAKE PLACE WITH OPTIONS REPORTER FOR THE REQUIREMENTS TO CLARIFY THAT ADDITIONALITY. THERE WILL BE CHALLENGES AFFORDABILITY IS AN ACUTE CONCERN COMBINED TO CALIFORNIANS THAT IS THE QUESTION OF HOW NOT WHETHER. WE SPENT FIFTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON GASOLINE MEMBERS. SHOULD BE MORE THAT REVENUE TO POWERING OUR HOMES AND CARS PEOPLE TO CHRISTY WILL CREATE JOBS BUILDING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOWER ELECTRIC RATES FOR EVERYBODY. THANKS COSTS OF MAINTAINING HARI. THE GREAT WILL BE SPREAD OVER MORE SALES. THE NOW BECAUSE NO SAN IN ENACT ON QUITE THAT WE CAN RECYCLE. OUR TO BE ABLE TO TELL MY KIDS THAT THE FATHER THAT WE WROTE TO THE WORLD REFOCUSES ATTENTION ON CLIMATE ACTION THIS FALL IN GLASGOW. COMING OUT OF THE TRUMPCARE AND ENDEMIC CALIFORNIA HAS A PIVOTAL OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE THE BAR THE GLOBAL ACTION TO ONCE AGAIN LEAD BY EXAMPLE. FIFTY FIVE ANY TO START THAT CONVERSATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I THOUGHT. OKAY ADULT COUNTY. THIS BUDGET IF YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KEEP A VERY BRIEF BECAUSE YOU'RE CALLING UNFORTUNATELY USED A USED A FEW TIMES. SO PLEASE PLEASE MAKE IT IS CONNECTED OKAY POSSIBLE. UNDERSTOOD YES THIS IS DAN CAMPBELL WHEN YOU SEE BERKELEY AND I'M HONORED TO TODAY TO SPEAK ON SUPPORT OF SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO. I WANT TO STRESS THAT WHILE THE GOALS OF BEACH YOU ARE AMBITIOUS THEIR ACHIEVABLE GOALS BASED ON THE DRAMATIC PROGRESS WE'VE SEEN IN CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY COSTS. EQUALLY IMPORTANT SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO WILL TRIGGER AN INTEGRATED SUITE OF ACTIONS SUCH AS THE BILLS WERE HEARING TODAY. THEY WILL INVEST NOT ONLY IN A LOWER COST ECONOMY BUT IN SOCIAL JUSTICE IN THE STATE THAT COMMITTED TO THAT. I WILL. COMMENT ON THE CLIMATE SCIENCE THOSE ARE WELL BOUNCE. BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A REMARKABLE RECORD AS WE JUST HEARD. VERY DIFFICULT GOLDEN MAKING THEM ACHIEVABLE. AB THIRTY TWO AND SB THIRTY TWO AND BEFORE THAT AB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE ALL XCELERATED GOALS. AND THEIR WORDS HARD LARGE NUMBERS OF SKEPTICS WERE CALIFORNIA'S ONE MILLION SOLAR ROOFS AND ONE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLE TARGETS BOLTS THAT WERE ACHIEVED. THOSE BROUGHT JOBS QUANTITATIVELY. DEMONSTRABLE BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY BY MOVING AHEAD WITH THESE GOALS CALIFORNIA THAT WAS MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE EMPLOYED. IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND WE'RE SEEING SHIPS OUT OF BALSA PEELED INTO GREEN ENERGY JOBS ALL THE TIME. CALIFORNIA NEEDS BOLD SHORT AND LONG TERM ENERGY STORAGE AND AFTER CRITICAL FEATURE AB TWENTY BY FOURTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN. LAUNCHED A STORAGE MARKETING CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOW SEEING INDIVIDUAL STORAGE PLANTS COMING ONLINE LARGER THAN THE ENTIRE OBLIGATION OF. ONE POINT THREE GIGAWATTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY. BUT MOST COULD BEACH I'M ONLY LIMON ON THE IS THAT THE- OF NOT IN. THE BILL ARE FAR HIGHER THAN ANY OF THE AFTER. OF THE COST OF THE TRANSIT. WE SEEM TO THE FIRES WE'VE SEEN THE DESTRUCTION COMMUNITIES LIKE PARADISE AND WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN DISTRIBUTED CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY STORAGE. THAT CALIFORNIA HEY THE MUCH HIGHER BILL FOR NOT TAKING YOUR CRITICAL GOALS ARE USED MY LAST TWO MINUTES WITH THE THIRD AND PROBABLY MOST IMPORTANT REASON WHY WE NEED TO PASS A LET'S MAKE IT HAPPEN MINUTE Y. MODERNO MIGHT APOLOGIZE SENATOR STERN. YEAH I GOT IT OKAY- APPROVED CALIFORNIA IS A NON JUST CALIFORNIA SPARE THE AIR DAYS RESULTING BLACKOUTS TOXIC SPILLS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. BLIND COMMUNITIES BY INVESTING IN FIVE EIGHTY TWO WE INVEST SOCIAL JUSTICE WE BRING DOWN THE COST FOR ALL OF US.

OKAY THANK YOU FIVE WELL THIS NOW BRINGS THE ITEM TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THOUGHTS DISCUSSION. SENATE CASKEY. CLICK TO SEE THIS MORNING THE AMBITIOUS US SENATOR STERN- AS I NOTED AT THE COMING OUT OF PARIS THE ACCORD SAID- SEPARATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION AT ABOUT 17% OBVIOUSLY AB THIRTY TWO DIDN'T ALLOW THAT A. B. SB THIRTY TWO DOES ALLOW A DOES ALLOW WITH- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT WORLDWIDE GOAL WITH THE- RESTORATION RESILIENCY THAT YOU'RE- PUTTING FORTH NOW. I THINK I THINK WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IN THAT. BUT THE AIM IS NOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE- CARBON REMOVAL OR ADAPTATION EFFORTS NECESSARILY COUNT TOWARDS THE MITIGATION GOAL IN THE SAME WAY SO BUT THAT. BY PUTTING RESOURCES AGENCY WHICH HERETOFORE HAS NOT REALLY HAD THE BIN IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT ON. OUR CARBON STRATEGY- AND TO SORT OF ESTABLISH A PROCESS THROUGH THAT ARCHITECTURE- IT'S A PROPOSAL YOU KNOW I I'M I'M OPEN TO ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE ROLE FOR INSTANCE ON A PATH TO CARBON NEUTRALITY THAT CERTAIN TYPES OF MITIGATION EFFORTS PLAY BUT AS YOU KNOW THEY BELIEVE BETWEEN MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION RIGHT. I THINK I THINK FINDING THAT LINE TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY THE NATURAL WORKING LAND SPACE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO RAISE THE TENSION THERE BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTS THAT ARE MITIGATION ACTION IN A NATURAL WORKING ON AN ADAPTATION AND HOW WOULD THAT WORK I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT ANSWER SORTED OUT YET BUT I WANTED TO SEND THE SIGNAL OF A- SOME KIND OF- COROLLARY AND DEFENSIBLE FRAMEWORK ON ITS OWN TO RIDE IN PARALLEL NOT TO BE SEPARATE DECISION THE SCOPING PLAN NOT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE SCOPING PLAN BUT- TO HAVE. NOT THE AIRBOARD DRIVING BUT REALLY THE AGENCY OVERSEEING ALL THE RESEARCH SIDE. OKAY I'M- MORE ON PAGE. TO PAGE SIX WE TALK ABOUT THE CARBOMER NO OPTIONS THIS IS A QUESTION ASIAN BIOMASS CONVERSION. ARE YOUR SPONSORS- AND I GUESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO. SUPPORT ALL THE CAL CARBON SEQUESTRATION OPTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THERE ARE THE I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THERE ARE SOME CARBON SEQUESTRATION STEP WILL REDUCE CARBON THAT THERE'S A LOT OF AS I LOOK DOWN THE SCOREBOARD OF PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS. WOULD SAY OH NO DON'T DO THAT YEAH WE WANT THIS LAUDABLE GOAL BUT DON'T DO THAT SO I'M JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE YOU'RE SO RIGHT TO RAISE IT AND I AGREE I THINK THERE ARE THERE ARE AREAS THAT MAKE ME. ANXIOUS IS AS OPENING SALVOS- I DON'T THINK THAT THE FIRST MOVING PROJECTS SHOULD BE AREAS WHERE THE SCIENCE IS UNCERTAIN BUT ALSO WHERE THEIR- COULD BE DIRECT EMISSIONS REDUCTION DIRECT EMISSIONS POTENTIAL IN ACTUAL FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES SO REFINING THE DEFINITION OF CARBON REMOVAL AND THAT RESTORATION FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT. I THEIR PRIORITIZATION IS PUT IN HERE OR OR SOME KIND OF ABILITY TO- ENSURE THAT THERE IS NO SE- NET EMISSIONS INCREASE IN A COMMUNITY OR ACTUALLY WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE IS A COROLLARY NET EMISSIONS DECREASE SOME ABILITY SAY YES YOU'RE REMOVING CARBON BUT CAN YOU ALSO ASSOCIATE THAT WITH SOME KIND OF LOCAL EMISSIONS BENEFIT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF METRICS WHICH WILL HELP US. REFINE IT BUT I WILL TELL YOU WE DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE ANSWERS YET I MEAN I GET IT IT'S NICE THE NICE TO TALK ABOUT WORKING LANDS AND EVERYBODY ALL ALL THE SPONSORS EVERYBODY'S ARE UP THERE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF EMISSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON THE COVERED ENTITY'S AND THE CAP AND TRADE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET THE. GREEN LIGHT TO SAY YOU CAN JUST. CAPTURE A CARBON FIBER SMALL. AND THEN PUT IT IN A ABANDONED OIL WELL AND IT BE PEOPLE BUT JUST SO WE'RE WE'RE SURE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IF WE'RE TRYING TO GET IN THAT ZERO AND NEGATIVE WE'RE GOOD WE'RE AND WE'RE USING ALL THE TOOLS- ON. THE VULNERABILITY- PUTTING PEOPLE FIRST AND ON THE ON THE- THE CLIMATE IMPACTS I AGES. FOOD FOR THOUGHT I KNOW IN THE BAY AREA WE HAVE A LOT OF SEA LEVEL RISE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON IN YES WHEN WE HAVE SEA LEVEL RISE THEY WILL FLOOD THE LOW LAYING AREAS WHICH TEND TO BE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OR AREAS THAT HAVE TO BE REPRESENTED BY ME BUT PUT THAT ASIDE SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE- BUILDING A BRIDGE AND TAKING OUT SOME LEVEES THAT WERE THERE THAT THAT ACTUAL WORK WILL NOT BE GOING ON IN A IF PER SE. VULNERABLE COMMUNITY BUT THE BENEFIT OF THE WORK WE GO AND I JUST WANT TO THE AS WE LOOK AT THESE BIG IDEAS- IT THAT THAT ANY AND THEIR REGIONAL AND YOU MIGHT NOT WE MIGHT HAVE TO MOVE BEYOND THE COUNTY AND THE AND THE CITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THIS IS THIS IS. WHAT WILL BENEFIT ME AND I WOULD SAY THE MILK MAYBE A BIGGER PROJECT- I GUESS AND- I ALSO SUGGESTED TO THE CRITICS THAT SAY WE CAN'T GET A SPENDING PACKAGE RIGHT NOW THAT IS PUTTING US ON TARGET TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES BY 40% WEEK WE CAN'T WE'RE SPENDING A BUNCH OF MONEY ON THE LAUDABLE THINGS. THAT ARE NOT REDUCING CARBON AND WE GOT YOU KNOW IN FACT THIS MEMBERS IS COMMITTEE OR TIRE LISTEN TO ME TALK ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN CARBON REDUCTION AND POLLUTION WHICH IS ALL PROBLEMS- WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE CRITICS THAT SAY WHY THIS IS AMBITIOUS IN THE SENSE OF COMMITMENT. IT'S NOT THE NUTS AND BOLTS TYPE OF. THE ACTIONS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE FROM THE 40% CLIMATE- REDUCTIONS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. I THINK THEY'RE RIGHT IN THAT IF WE KEEP SPENDING. AND INVESTING THE WAY WE ARE CURRENTLY WON'T BE ENOUGH H. A. W. N. N. AS WE BROUGHT UP IN THE HEARING YOU HAD WITH THE TRANSPORTATION CHAIR HERE THE OTHER DAY. MAKE THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION NUMBER IN DOES YOUR MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR INSTANCE. WHAT I RAISED TO THE TO THE MINISTRIES I SAID. YOU KNOW IF YOU DO THE AMERICAN JOBS PLAN MATH WE'RE ACTUALLY ON TRACK FOR FIVE BILLION A YEAR IF IT ACTUALLY IF WE GOT ONE FIFTIETH OF THE MONEY. FIVE X. THAT KIND OF. SCALE OF INVESTMENT AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME THING ON WILDFIRE RIGHT WE WERE ABOUT TO SEND A DEAL FOR HALF A BILLION DOLLARS I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF MONEY FIVE X. I MEAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT EXACT MATH BUT- THAT SCALE OF INVESTMENT IS ACTUALLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO GET THERE AND I DON'T THINK WE'VE- WE FIGURED OUT HOW TO BE. AMBITIOUS WITH OUR OWN CURRENT SCALE SO I GET THAT IT'S PUSHING US BEYOND THAT BUT- THIS CAN'T JUST BE DONE BY REGULATION AND NOT ALONE I MEAN THAT THAT AMERICAN JOBS PLAN. AND A MAJOR MAJOR FEDERAL INVESTMENTS PROBABLY THE ONLY PATH WE CAN WE CAN MAKE. WELL YOU ARE RIGHT ABOUT WE SHOULD BE SAYING SPENDING FIVE X. ON WILDFIRE PREVENTION IN ORDER TO. THE NEXT DECADE TO REACH OUR GOALS SO- I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE MEASURE TODAY I SOMETIMES BY A- LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WORK THAT YOU DO YOU TOO AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT D. ADVOCATES REALIZE THAT THESEARE ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX WHICH SOME OF THEM MAY BE ONES THAT THEY ARE. UNPREPARED TO EMBRACE EMBRACE IF IT AND COOPERATION PUT PRIVATE SECTOR TODAY TO REACH TO REACH THESE THINGS IS GOING TO BE A RELAXATION THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY IN ORDER TO TAKE TO GET HERE AND I THINK SOME OF THEM. BUT WHEN I SAID MY TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS IN AND SAY I'M PARTY YOUR CROWD THEY LIKE IT BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE DETAILS THEY'RE NOT GONNA LIKE IT- SO. THAT SAID. THANK YOU. SORRY FOR NOT BEING HERE FOR- PRIMARK SO YOU MAY HAVE TO REPEAT JUST A LITTLE BIT LIKE I. WHAT DID YOU SAY- AS A LEGISLATOR NOW FOR NINE YEARS I I'VE SEEN SB THREE FIFTY I MEAN WE'VE SEEN ALL KINDS OF LAUDABLE LIKE REALLY AGGRESSIVE- AMBITIOUS. TARGET IN. FOR YOU I'M I JUST I THINK FOR ME IT'S LIKE WHEN WE DID THE WATER BOND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE THOUGHT WE COULD GET IN BONDS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY WENT OUT AND SAID HEY HOW MUCH WATER DO WE REALLY NEED TO FIX OUR PROBLEMS AND HOW HOW DO WE GET THERE WE DON'T WE DO THINGS BACKWARDS ARE WE DON'T. ANALYZE THE SITUATION AND SAY HEY. THIS IS THE GOAL. THIS IS THE THANKS TO GET YOU TO THAT GOAL. WE GO THE OTHER WAY. WE GO HEY WE'RE GOING TO MARKET GOAL OUT THERE. IN FOR EXAMPLE. WE HAD- AB THIRTY TWO WAS THE THEIR STARTING OF THIS WHOLE. PROJECT IN. IN FOR THE FOR THE WE WERE IN TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THE CHAIRWOMAN STOOD ON HER FEET FOR. FOUR AND A HALF HOURS AT LEAST I THINK. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE STEPS. WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING WHERE WE WANT TO GO. AND ONE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE AUDIENCE AND WE LOOK AT THE- WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHAT HOW WE'RE ACHIEVING IT WE'RE SPENDING. HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND IT COMES AT A COST TO CALIFORNIANS. SO I'M I'M PAINTING A REALLY BROAD PICTURE HERE BECAUSE THIS IS A REALLY BROUGHT THIS IS A REALLY AGGRESSIVE. ONE OF THOSE GOALS AGAIN. AND SO ARE MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. THE DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND HOW WE GET THERE. I DON'T I I'M FOR THE FOR THE LIFE OF ME I DON'T LIKE TO SET POLICY WITHOUT HAVING A ROAD MAP OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SO COULD YOU GIVE ME A ROAD MAP. AND I'M NOT YOU PUT WHATEVER NUMBER YOU WANT TO PUT ON IT BUT TELL ME HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE AND SHE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHEAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY. NOW ALL OF A THIS IS THE QUESTION THAT HAS TO BE ANSWERED. TO CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE PAYING. I MEAN. WE HEARD. THE BUDGET CHAIR. LAST WEEK ON THE FLOOR SAY. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA SO WE NEED TO. GIVE PEOPLE. MORE RECENTLY ACTUALLY TAKE. TAXPAYERS MONEY AND GIVE IT TO THE DISADVANTAGED FOLKS. WELL BUT DIDN'T DATE WERE ALL TAXPAYERS WHETHER IT'S FEDERAL MONEY OR STATE MONEY. OR IF THE REGULATIONS ARE WHICH IS THIS BILL WOULD CAUSE A REGULATION. IT IS LIKE CALIFORNIA THIS IS A FACT. SO SECRET THAT WE PAY 40% MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE. IN ELECTRICITY COSTS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE AGGRESSIVE GOALS AND THAT'S WHERE THIS MONEY IS COMING FROM SO WE TALK ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF CALIFORNIA. IT'S BECAUSE WE'VE PASSED THE REGULATIONS AND IT TRICKLES DOWN TO HEY YOU GOT TO PAY MORE MORE MONEY AT YOUR AT THE GAS PUMP. AT THE AT YOUR LECTURE CITY YOUR BUILDING BECAUSE IT ALL DRIVES COSTS UP SO MY QUESTION TO USE TELL ME HOW WE GET THERE. IT BY TWENTY THIRTY BY THE WAY WHICH IS. NOT VERY FAR OFF. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION IN THE CHALLENGE IT'S NECESSARY IF I'M BRINGING A BILL LIKE THIS BEFORE YOU SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A ILL FOUNDED THE SCOPE OF WHAT YOU ASK- AND I THINK I OWE IT. TO YOU AND EVERY MEMBER WHO'S GONNA HAVE TO VOTE ON. IF THEY IF THE BILL MAKES IT THROUGH HERE TODAY. BEFORE THIS BILL- IT SHOULD MAKE IT TO THE FLOOR. WE CAN'T AS A WHOLE SENATE VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T ANSWER SOME OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS I CAN'T PROMISE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING HERE TODAY BUT LET ME GIVE YOU A SENSE. OF WHAT I MEAN VERY PRACTICAL TERMS. WHEN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND THE INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR ARE TRYING TO DECIDE RIGHT NOW. WHAT KIND OF POWER TO BRING ONLINE AND LONG TERM. ARE THEY GOING TO MAKE A SORT OF SERIES OF SMALLER INCREMENTAL DECISIONS AND TRY TO FILL THE GAPS TO HIT TWENTY THIRTY OR THEY GONNA TRY TO REIMAGINE THE ENTIRE GRID WHERE YOU HAVE. ZERO CARBON BASELOAD RENEWABLES FROM. GEOTHERMAL AND BIOMASS LOOKING AT CCS AND DOING BIG CREATIVE THINGS ARE WE JUST GONNA KIND OF RATCHET UP. A LITTLE SOLAR WIND AND KIND OF. E. LIMPAR WAITED THIRTY- LIKEWISE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR I THINK GOVERNOR LAID OUT SOME OF THE VISION BUT- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE BIG. BUT THE PIECES THAT DON'T GET TALKED ABOUT- IN AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY. THOSE SECTORS ARE GOING TO BE DECIMATED OVER THE NEXT DECADES- YOU CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE FAR MOBILE BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY ON CURRENT TRAJECTORY SO. HOW TO ACTUALLY RESTORE THE LAND BRING IN AGRICULTURE EMPOWER THEM- BRING IN I DON'T WANT TO SHUT DOWN INDUSTRY WITH THIS BILL I'D- LIKE I DON'T THINK CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE A PLACE THAT IMPORTS. ALL OF ITS FUEL OR ITS CEMENT OR ITS WOOD OR ANY OF THOSE PRODUCTS RIGHT. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO FORCE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT ACTUALLY MEANS TO BE. BE AS BOLD AS WE WANT TO BE HERE. AND THAT RESTORATION FRAMEWORK AND THAT REMOVAL PIECE I. AND CENTER Y. CASI POINT WILL. ODD AND- CONVERSATION A LITTLE BIT I THINK IN THE STATE. AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE FOLKS WHO MAYBE DON'T ALWAYS SIT ACROSS THE TABLE IN FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES AND MAYBE THAT THE TRADES THAT ARE WORKING THERE IN. THE OIL INDUSTRY IN THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRY PLAY PLACES THAT ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK SO I WANT TO FORCE THAT WITH THIS. AND I'M I'M HOPING. THAT THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE BECAUSE I THINK IT'S NECESSARY. THAT THAT'S REALLY IT I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE. UP A PRESS RELEASE EXERCISE OF A OF A NEW FANCY NUMBER. I'M I'M I'M I TIRE OF THOSE TWO AND IF IT TURNS OUT THAT. THEY'RE HAVING A NEW NUMBER FOR TWENTY THIRTY ISN'T THE RIGHT WAY TO REALLY PUSH THE AIRPORT AND PUSH THIS ADMINISTRATION. TO DO BIG THINGS IN THE CURRENT PLANNING. IN THIS SIX TWO YEAR PERIOD RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE THEIR OWN PLAN WITHOUT US. IF IT'S IF THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT MECHANISM TO PUSH THEM TO ACCELERATE. I'M OPEN TO WHAT IT IS I WANTED TO START I WANTED TO SEND A SHOT ACROSS THE BOW HERE AND SAY. THIS IS HOW BIG I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOING IN THIS NEXT COPING PLAN AND- AND- IF WE DON'T DO THAT I THINK AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO SORT OF JUST TRY TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY AND LIMPAR WAY TO TWENTY THIRTY. WHILE THE WORLD BURNS SO I OWE YOU MORE. MATH MODELING DEATH. I'VE REPORTS E. THREE VIEW ANY P. L. LAWRENCE LIVERMORE STUDY INTERESTING WANT TO CARBON NEUTRALITY. BUT LET'S DIGGING DEEPER HERE BECAUSE IT EZER OF THAT SO. THAT THAT'S THAT'S. MY BEST SHOT AT A- QUICK RESPONSE. I APPRECIATE. FIVE I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW AS A BUSINESS OWNER AND SOMEBODY WHO COMPETES WITH BUSINESSES THAT ARE ARE IN CALIFORNIA. I LIVE MY BUSINESS IS VERY CLOSE TO THE BORDERS I AM NOT A SEVENTY FIVE MILES FROM. FROM OREGON AND ABOUT A HUNDRED TEN MILES FROM NEVADA AND THOSE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE SAME- RESTRICTIONS I HAVE OR THE COST I HAVE SO. IT IF THERE ARE NO BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA I GUESS YOU MAYBE MEET YOUR MISSION LAWS BUT WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM OF A REVENUE PROBLEM WE DON'T HAVE BUSINESSES SO I'M NOT GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY BUT I WANT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK. I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE THE UP FRONT DETAILED INFORMATION SO YOU CAN BRING THAT. THE OIL COMPANY AND ELECTRIC COMPANY TOGETHER- THE LECTOR EVEY GUYS RIGHT AND- AND I KNOW THAT YOU WERE ON THE U. WE SAID ON A LOT OF THE SAME COMMITTEES AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME PASSIONS ABOUT. IT IS HOW WE GET THERE I THINK IS THE DIFFERENCES OF MAYBE YOU KNOW AND OUR IDEAS AND WHAT'S BEEN REALLY FRUSTRATING THIS YEAR AND I THINK THAT YOU YOU YOU BRING IT UP AND SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS IS THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM THE AIR BOARD AND FROM. YOU KNOW THE THAT THAT WHEN WE DID AUDITS WERE NOT GETTING WORSE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU BROUGHT UP I KEYED OFF OF IT LAST. EEK IN THE TRANSPORTATION MISSION WHEN- MAY IT WAS. I CAN'T WHICH TWENTY TALK ABOUT THE ONLY THING. A MILLION CARS AND WE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF VEHICLES THIRTY. FEET IS SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE REALLY HIGH NUMBERS TO GET TO SO. I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA LEAD. AND WE'RE TRULY GOOD ONLY. NOT JUST LEADING FEEL GOOD AND DO THEM AND GET THAT PRESS RELEASE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WE GET THREE PRESSURES BUT THE DEVIL'S KNOT IN THE DETAILS THE DETAILS ARE NOW BEING WORKED OUT AS WE GO THROUGH IT. AND THE COST IS HUGE. AND WE'RE NOT GETTING WHAT WE WHAT WE PUT WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR. WHETHER IT'S- THE HIGH SPEED RAIL WHETHER IT'S WHETHER IT'S LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THAT AND RUDY SALAS IS DISTRICT THAT THAT AREN'T GETTING IT. THE E. V. I MEAN THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DIG INTO WE TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED FOLKS. THEY'RE NOT THE TABLE. THEY ARE THE WEALTHY PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW TO GET TO THE GRANT PROCESS OR THEIR- AND THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE DRIVING IN THE- IN THE- IN THE- IN THE FAST LANE. AND THE POOR PEOPLE RUNS SLOWLY BREATHING BAD BETTER IT'S JUST IT'S WHAT WE GOT TO BE MORE RESPONSIBLE AND I KNOW I'M NOT THIS IS NOT AT DIRECT YOU WHICH IS SOME OF MY THOUGHTS TO GET US WHERE WE CAN HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WHERE WE HAVE A ROAD MAP. AND THEN WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE COST AND HOW WE GET THERE SO I APPRECIATE THAT CONVERSATION AND SORRY I MISSED YOUR OPENING REMARKS BY. APPRECIATE THE DIALOGUE IN AND IN THE OF TRYING TO GET SOMETHING DONE ON THE GROUND AND WHEN IT COMES TO AGRA I'LL BE I'LL BE TO TABLETHERE'S A THERE ARE SOME TOOLS OUT THERE BUT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOW WE- DO BETTER WITH OUR SOILS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES INDEED- AMBITIOUS BILL TIME. BUT AN INPUT OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT ON SO HAD APPREHENDED HIM MOTIONS. FROM SENATORS HOURS HAVE WHICH ARE TO CLOSE CENTER. RESHAPE THE RIGOR IN THE DIALOGUE THAT'S WHAT I EXPECT OUT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEES TO ELEVATE THIS KIND OF. THESE TENSIONS AND THE DETAILS SO I MAKE A VERY FIRM COMMITMENT TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT- WANT TO. DO A LOT MORE HOMEWORK WITH YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE THE STAFF'S WORK BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU IS PARTNERS HERE AND I WOULD SAY THE SAME GOES BY THE WAY FOR A BUDGET SUB CHAIR. AND FOR TRANSPORTATION CHAIR WHO HAPPEN TO BE SITTING BEFORE ME- I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A SOLO MISSION HERE I WANT THIS TO BE A- AS AN EXERCISE THAT THAT LIFTS ALL BOATS AND HOPEFULLY GIVES US ROOM TO. TO BE CALIFORNIA TO BE WHO WE ARE BECAUSE WE WON'T. WE RECOVER FROM THIS PANDEMIC THE WAY WE USED TO DO THINGS- WE'RE GOING TO SLIP BACK INTO ALL THE SAME PROBLEMS AGAIN AND FALL BEHIND FURTHER THAN WE CAN EVER CATCH UP SO. WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE. THANK YOU. THE CONSULTANT PLEASE CALDERON ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN SB FIVE EIGHTY TWO BY SENATOR STERN THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER ALAN HI. ALAN I BATES. BATES NO DALLY GO DOWN I KNOW GONZALEZ AND SALAS I SKINNER STERN HI STERN HI MY COUNTY HI CASKEY I. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY IS THERE HE IS. BUT THERE IS- TIME TO GO OVER AND BUDGET OKAY SO NOW LET'S GO TO ITEM FIVE S. B. TWO EIGHTY NINE OUR GOOD FRIEND THE ENERGIZER. EDDERY BY ANY JOSH NEWMAN. AB DAY MR IS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT I WOULD STOP BY I AM VERY SORRY FOR MY NOTED THAT WE PROVIDED US I ACTUALLY HAD FOR BILLS IN OF THE COMMITTEE THAT I JUST COMPLETED. THEY WERE NEARLY AS POPULAR AS THIS BILL IS ABOUT TO BE FIVE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM HERE BEFORE YOU DID ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF S. B. TWO EIGHTY NINE- WHICH WE CREATED CONVENIENCE STATEWIDE PRODUCER FUNDED COLLECTION AND RECYCLING PROGRAM FOR LOOSE. AND PRODUCT EMBEDDED BATTERIES AS YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE BECAUSE OF THE HAZARDOUS METALS ACROSS MATERIALS THAT BATTERIES CONTAIN. CALIFORNIA CLASS SIZE BATTERIES AS HAZARDOUS WASTE. AND EXPLICITLY BANNED BATTERIES FROM SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS. WE'RE DONE WITH THEIR LOOSE BATTERIES IN PORTABLE ELECTRONICS THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SAVE THEM SORT THEM AND THEN FIND INAPPROPRIATE DISPOSAL OPTION. UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY LACKS A STREAMLINED AND CONVENE A COLLECTION RECYCLING SYSTEMS BATTERIES. AT THE MOMENT THIS TENDS TO BE MORE THE EXCEPTION THAN THE RULE- I WOULD ASK YOU IS CONTACTING CONCERN THE BILL BEFORE YOU. JUST TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT ALL YOUR BATTERIES YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE DOUBLE A. AND TRIPLE A. AND OTHER TYPES OF BATTERIES THAT YOU GO THROUGH A YEAR. POWERING ALL THE MANY DEVICES THAT ARE SO DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN A THOROUGHLY MODERN LIVES THESE DAYS. REMOTE CONTROLS COMPUTER KEYBOARDS MICE CLOCKS FLASHLIGHT YOUR KIDS TOYS THAT KIND OF THING. NOW THINK ABOUT ALL THE RE CHARGEABLE DEVICES EVERYBODY CARRIES THESE DAYS AS WELL EACH ONE WITH ITS OWN LITHIUM ION OR SIMILAR BATTERY. NOW MULTIPLY YOUR BATTERIES BY CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION JUST UNDER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE AND CONSIDER HOW CHALLENGING IT IS TO PROBABLY RECYCLE ALL THOSE BATTERIES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE FACT THAT THERE'S CURRENTLY NO UNIFIED SYSTEM IN PLACE. IN CALIFORNIA FOR DOING SO WERE DOING SO WELL. NOW CONSIDER THIS ALARMING FACT AS WELL EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE BATTERIES CONTAINS HAZARDOUS TOXIC AND CORROSIVE MATERIALS. LIKE MERCURY CADMIUM LITHIUM AND LET WHEN IMPROPERLY DISCARDED BATTERIES POSE A SERIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS BECAUSE OF A COMBINATION OF INCREASED CONSUMPTION. A LACK OF CONVENIENT DISPOSAL OPTIONS HIGHER LEVELS OF TOXIC BATTERIES AND PRODUCTS ARE CONTINUALLY ENTERING THE WASTE STREAM IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN BATTERIES ARE TOSSED INTO THE TRASH INSTEAD OF PROPPING PROPERLY RECYCLED THE END UP IN LANDFILLS WHERE THEY DECLARE DECAY AND LEAK. AS DISPOSABLE BATTERIES CORRODE THEIR CHEMICAL SOAK INTO SOIL AND CONTAMINATE GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER. DELICATE NO RESTRAINT ECOSYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED WHEN EXPOSED TO BATTERY CHEMICALS WHEN WE DRINK FROM TAP WATER FAUCETS WE COULD BE INGESTING DANGEROUS METALS. LITHIUM BATTERIES IN PARTICULAR THE ONES THAT YOU FIND YOUR CHARGEABLE DEVICES CAN BE VERY UNSTABLE. AND WHEN IMPROPERLY DISPOSED TO POSE SERIOUS FIRE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS IN FACT OVER THE PAST DECADE. THE MASSIVE INFLUX OF IMPROPERLY DISPOSED OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES INTO CALIFORNIA'S WAY STREAM HAS RESULTED IN AN ALARMING NUMBER OF FIRES IN OUR MATERIAL RECOVERY. FACILITIES WASTE COLLECTION TRUCKS AND LANDFILLS. WHEN LITHIUM ION BATTERIES BURN IT RELY RELEASES FLUORIDE GAS WHICH POSES SERIOUS TOXIC THREATS TO THE HEALTH. AND SAFETY OF WORKERS FIRE FIGHTERS IN THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES THE VAPORIZE COMPONENTS OF BURN BATTERIES ALSO GET TRAPPED IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND POLLUTE LAKES AND STREAMS IN THE FORM OF ACID RAIN. AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTING TO GLOBAL WARMING. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL SURVEY TWENTY OF THE TWENTY SIX MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES. THAT THEY SURVEYED EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE FIRE DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. THIRDS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO IMPROPERLY DISCARDED. LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. WITHOUT DRAMATICALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF LITHIUM ION BATTERIES ENTERING CALIFORNIA'S WE STREAM CALIFORNIA WILL SUFFER ADDITIONAL FIRES. THAT WOULD JEOPARDIZE WASTE OPERATIONS AND HEALTH AND SAFETY OF WORKERS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU'LL BE HEARING FIRSTHAND TODAY FROM ONE OF THE LEAD WITNESSES. THIS MORNING ABOUT THE DEVASTATING IMPACT OF THESE FIRES UNDER ITS PROVISIONS SB TWO EIGHTY NINE WILL CREATE A CORD ANY SYSTEM. OF FREE AND CONVENIENT COLLECTION BINS FOR MOST LOSING PRODUCT BETTER BATTERIES AT RETAIL LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. TO OUR CONSUMERS REPLACE BATTERIES INTO THE BINS FOR PROPER DISPOSAL RATHER THAN DISCARDING THEM ALONG WITH THE REST OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD TRASH. THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE A CONSUMER OUTREACH AND EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE CALIFORNIANS. AND ENCOURAGES THE PROPER DISPOSAL OF ALL TYPES OF BATTERIES THIS APPROACH TO POLICY GENERALLY FOR TWO IS EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY. WHICH S. B. TWO EIGHTY NINE WILL APPLY TO CONSUMER BATTERIES. HAS FOR ROOTS AND KILL. LAW HONEST PRE EMPLOYED TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE RECYCLING. AN ARRAY OF HARD TO RECYCLE MATERIALS FROM MATTRESSES TO AUTOMOBILE TIRES TOO NOT COINCIDENTALLY CAR BATTERIES AS WELL. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THIS LEGISLATOR PASSED BY NEARLY UNANIMOUS VOTE SB TWO ONE TWO. AUTHORED BY OUR COLLEAGUE FORMER SENATOR HANNAH BETH JACKSON WHICH REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO TAKE BACK UNUSED AND WASTED NEEDLES. AND DISCARDED DRUGS. S. B. TWENTY NINE REPLICATES THIS MODEL AND CONTINUES THIS VERY POSITIVE TREND. OPPOSITION IS LIKELY TO ASSERT THE BILL WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF VITAL. PRODUCTS TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO THAT I WOULD RE. PER OUT THAT THE- OF THESE LIFT ION INDUCED FIRES ARE ALREADY BEING BORNE. BY OUR WASTE AND RECYCLING OPERATORS HAVE GOVERNMENTS FIRE PROFESSIONALS. THE ENVIRONMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND CONSUMERS AS A PARTIAL CONSEQUENCE CALIFORNIA CITIZENSHIP FOR THE GARBAGE RATES WILL INCREASE IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. AND SEES LITHIUM ION BATTERIES CONTINUE TO CAUSE TOXIC FIRES ACROSS THE STATE. THE COST OF INSURING LOCAL WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES CERTAIN TO INCREASE AS WELL. THE PRODUCERS OF CONSUMER BATTERIES DO NOT CURRENTLY SHOULDER ANY OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOXIC FIRES. IN OTHER IN VINYL HARM CAUSED BY THEIR PRODUCTS. BUT REALLY PRODUCES IS PART OF A MORE EFFECTIVE END TO END SYSTEM FOR RECYCLING SERVER BATTERIES. WE CAN PREVENT THESE DISASTERS FROM OCCURRING THEREBY SAVING. THE COST OF HIGHER GARBAGE REYES WHILE PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC REDUCING THE RISK TO WASTE FOR CITY WORKERS. AND BETTER SAFEGUARDING CALIFORNIA'S LAND WATER AND AIR BINDING MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS TO A SYSTEM SUCH AS THIS. IS EMINENTLY SENSIBLE AND FAIR AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SIMILAR EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE BILL'S SPONSORS MY OFFICE HAVE BEEN MEETING REGULARLY WITH OPPOSITION. AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WE ARE SENSITIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMITTED TO GENERATING SUPPORT. AMONG ALL PARTIES WERE LEAVING THE INTENT OF THE BILL INTACT WITH ME VIRTUALLY TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE JOE LUMBERTON LOT MARIANA. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RETHINK WASTE EDUCATION SCHMELZER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. THIRTY SANTA CLARA WILL GO YOUR FOR WITNESS. YES I'M SORRY JERRY TO BE CLEAR I DO AND I DID ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS GRACEFULLY. BOTH BOTH PRESENT AND PAST TENSE. AND PERHAPS IN THE FUTURE RIGHT HOPEFULLY ALL AMENDMENTS WE EVER FOR THE FORCE UPON IN THE FUTURE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATE ELECTRIFICATION LET'S GO TO- TO- DILEMMA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN HELLO- MEMBERS MY NAME'S DELIVERY ON AYE SERVICE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR RETHINK WASTE. WE ARE A PUBLICLY OWNED SOLID WASTE AGENCY IN SAN MATEO COUNTY WE ARE A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF SB TWO EIGHTY NINE. OR AGENCY WAS FORMED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WE PROVIDE ESSENTIAL SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITY. TO ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS ELEVEN THOUSAND BUSINESS TOURS. EACH YEAR ARE SIXTY MAKE SIXTEEN ACRE FACILITY HANDLES OVER ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF WASTE MATERIALS AND WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED. WORKERS UNDER BASED ON SITE. IN TERMS SIXTEEN. OR FACILITY EXPERIENCE STATE THE FIRST CATASTROPHIC EFFECTS OF THE LITHIUM ION BATTERY DUES FIRE AT A RECYCLING CENTER. THE FIRE COMPLETELY DEVASTATED OUR FACILITY SHUTTING US DOWN FOR FOUR MONTHS AND CAUSED EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGES. WELL IT WAS SHUT DOWN FOR FIFTY WORKERS WERE ALSO PER LOG IT TOOK ABOUT A YEAR TO FULLY REPAIR EVERYTHING. PRIOR TO THE FIRE WE HAD ONE SERVICE PROVIDER NOW WE NEED SEVEN TO PROVIDE THE SAME COVERAGE OR PREMIUMS OF STYLE SKYROCKETED IN A BIG INCREASED TWELVE FOLD. IN THAT TIME PERIOD INSURANCE PROVIDERS ARE SIMPLY FINDING IT TOO RISKY TO COVER FACILITIES LIKE US DUE TO THE RECENT NEGATIVE TREND PUBLIC BMI AND FIRES. WE GO PER MINUTE MANY PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE WASTE STREAM BUT STILL RECEIVE MANY BATTERIES THAT THREATEN OUR FACILITIES AND OUR WORKERS SAFETY. IN A RECENT STUDY WE STILL HAD RESTORE FINDING A LEVIN BATTERIES PER HOUR IN OUR FACILITY ANY ONE OF THEM COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER FIRE. LIKE THE ONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. ANOTHER FIRE ON THAT MAGNITUDE COULD CAUSE US TO LOSE ORANGE QUICKLY. THESE BATTERIES THREATEN ENTIRE OF OUR FUNDED WASTE COLLECTION AND RECYCLING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FIRES PROPOSED A PROPOSED A SERIOUS SAFETY THREAT TO OUR WORKERS UNFORTUNATELY THIS ISSUE IS NOW BECOME COMMON. RECYCLING FACILITIES ACROSS THE NATION THIS IS A CRISIS BUT NEED TO SOLUTION NOW WITH PMI AND BATTERIES ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMON EVERYDAY PRODUCTS PRODUCTS. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE IS CRITICAL TO PROTECTING OUR INDUSTRY INDUSTRIES INFRASTRUCTURE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR WORKERS SAFETY I RESPECTFULLY URGE YOUR VOTE. ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. BURKE MEXICO TO. WHO'S YOUR NEXT. THIS IS A SPONSORED. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MY NAME IS JASON SHELTER AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL ONE OF THE THREE CO SPONSORS OF SB TWO EIGHTY NINE I ALSO REPRESENT PRISM A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY THAT PROVIDES RISK AND INSURANCE SERVICES TO PUBLIC AGENCIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA THEY ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL- MISTER NEWMAN AND MR THE MARIANA COVERED THE NEED FOR THE BILL NICELY- I'M GONNA FOCUS ON WHAT THE BILL ACTUALLY DOES AND TRY TO PUT THAT INTO CONTEXT I NOTING THAT THE OPPOSITION IS REFERRED TO IT AS COMPLEX AND- CONCEIVED. WE OBVIOUSLY DISAGREE SB TWO EIGHTY NINE ESTABLISHES A PERFORMANCE BASED COLLECTION RECYCLING SYSTEM FOR ALL THESE BATTERIES IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN NON REMOVABLE BATTERIES- THIS IS A STRUCTURE THAT WE'VE SEEN BEFORE PRODUCERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO DESIGN FUND- AND OPERATE A PLAN THAT WOULD BE APPROVED BY CAL RECYCLE- THERE. ARE- A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS TO THE- PLAN AT ALL. A FEW PER. GOALS THAT WILL HELP THE PROGRAM STAY ON TRACK- BUT OTHERWISE IT'S FREE THE INDUSTRY UP TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM THAT WORKS FOR THEM IT IS BEING. PERFORMANCE BASED REGULATORY STRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO A COMMANDING CONTROL TYPE OF REGULATORY STRUCTURE. I DO WANNA REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS'S BEEN DONE BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY QUITE EFFECTIVELY. SB TWO EIGHTY NINE IS BASED ON RECENT LEGISLATION TO ENACT SIMILAR PROGRAMS FOR LEFTOVER DRUGS IN USED NEEDLES- IF CALIFORNIA CAN ASK THE MAKERS OF VITAL HEALTH CARE RELATED PRODUCTS YOU TO COLLECT THEIR ITEMS. WE CAN CERTAINLY ASK THAT OF BATTERY MAKERS- THE FINAL VERSION OF THE DRUG SHARPSVILLE WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE PRODUCERS AND PASSED BY BOTH HOUSES. I WITH OVERWHELMING MAJORITIES AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR OF THE AUTHOR AND THE CO SPONSORS HAVE BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPONENTS- AND WE WERE WE ARE OPEN TO FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THEIR CONCERNS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE BATTERIES AND THE PRODUCTS COVERED BY THIS BILL HAVE EXTRAORDINARY END OF LIFE AND TAX- FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. ZACKS UNIVERSAL WAIT AROUND.

OKAY ARE SO THERE'S NO NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION- NO OF TIMES ARE KNOWN AS IN SUPPORT ON THE PHONES- LET'S NOT LET'S NOT TURN A OPPOSITION FOLKS WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS AND- BUSINESS CARDS. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SCOTT COVERING HER BATH OF THE RECHARGEABLE BATTERY ASSOCIATION. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PROPONENTS AND THE AUTHOR IN FACT IN JANUARY WE SUGGESTED THAT THEY ADOPT THE- DC MODEL. THIS IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION IT TOOK EFFECT THIS YEAR. CREATIVE RECOVERY RECYCLING PROGRAM. THAT REQUEST WAS REJECTED OUTRIGHT TO GIVE YOU AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS CALPERS CYCLE TO IMPOSE FEES ON STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATIONS IT ALLOWS EVERY OTHER STATE AGENCY THAT MAY BE IMPACTED BY WASTE OR FIRE OR HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TO ALSO IMPOSE FEES IN THE BILL. IT ALLOWS RETAILERS TO IMPOSE ANY FEES THEY WANT ON STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FLOOR SPACE INSURANCE EMPLOYEE TRAINING EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. ALL OF. THESE COSTS WILL BE PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER PRICES WHAT THE BILL ALSO DOES WHICH WILL INCREASE THESE COSTS IS. HE HAS CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS SO EXEMPTS CONSUMER MEDICAL DEVICES FOR EXAMPLE WHICH WERE NOT EXEMPT IN DC I UNDERSTAND THE PROPONENTS ARE NOW TALKING TO OTHER GROUPS THAT EXEMPTING THEM TO. THE SMALLER THE UNIVERSE THE HIGHER THE PRICES. THE MATTRESS BILL DOESN'T EXEMPTS SOME MATTRESSES THEY'RE ALL COVERED BUT THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO TO CARVE OFF OPPOSITION IS TO SHRINK THE UNIVERSE. AS IT RELATES TO FIRES THIS BILL IS GOING TO CREATE THE PUT BINS IN STORES SO TARGET VAPE SHOPS OR WHATEVER. THERE'S NO SIZE RESTRICTION ON THE BATTERIES THAT CAN GO IN THESE BINS THERE FIFTY POUND CONSUMER BATTERIES WILL BE TOSSED INTO THESE BINS. ALONG WITH BUTTON CELLS AS WELL AS ALL THESE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BATTERIES IN THEM TOYS SMALL DRILLS WATCHES PHONES COMPUTERS YOU NAME IT. AND THEY'RE ALL GONNA SMASH ON TOP OF ONE ANOTHER SO NO WONDER THE WASTE AGENCIES SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE YOU'RE PUTTING THE FIRE RISK IN THE STORES. AS RELATES TO RATES AND DATES. BUT THIS BILL SET UP AS A SCENARIO WHERE A VAPE SHOP CAN ACTUALLY GET PAID TO PUT A PIN IN THEIR SHOP. AND THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY THE OBLIGATION OF TARGET FOR EXAMPLE IT'S IN THE SAME REGION. HOW YOU GONNA MEET YOUR RATES AND DATES IF A SHOP THAT HAS ZERO FOOT TRAFFIC COLLECTS HAS THE BINS FOR THE BATTERIES. OWN BY THE WAY HE PUT VAPES IN THOSE BINS IT'S A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW- YOU KNOW AGAIN THE DC LAW WAS NO PANACEA. BUT AT LEAST IT WAS. COGENT COHERENT IN NEGOTIATED OVER SEVERAL YEARS. WHERE IS THIS. SEEMS TO BE A WISH LIST FOR THE PROPONENTS. AND IT'S NOT. IT IN. AND THE COST WILL BE BORNE BY CONSUMER. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECT THAT WERE. QUESTION OVER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERRANO FRAZIER- OKAY OTHER PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL HI I DON'T SEE WHAT ELSE IN EITHER OF THE ROOMS IN PERSON HOW ABOUT ON THE PHONE LINES MATAMATA. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. WE WILL GO LINE OF SIXTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. BONDOC THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO SP TWO EIGHT NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEXICO TOWLINE OF THE SEVENTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON KHAKI MCCUE CAP CAME TO THIRTY SOME HAVE THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. YEAH IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND IF YOU ARE IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. AND WE DO HAVE TO MARK CUBAN UP ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. WE'LL GO TO LINE ONE TWENTY SEVEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN FIRST AVENUE MALL ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF TWENTY. CHINA'S OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JACOB KATHY WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF HOME APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS WE ARE OPPOSED TO SB TWO EIGHT NINE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORED FURTHER ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU AND NEXT OVER TO LINE OF ONE THIRTY EIGHT ONE THREE EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE ADAMANTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN PERSPECTIVE OPPOSITION. AND LACK OF MY COMMENT WITH THE- THE MONEY TO WORK BURKE. WISH TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO FIND RESOLUTION CREATED THANKS. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE NO FURTHER OPPOSITION THANK YOU AT THIS TIME. OKAY WILL COME BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE MAY SEEM IF YOU THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DIALOGUE YOU'LL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY CENTER TO. ANSWER SOME OF THE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY. MISTER GOVERNOR OTHERS- OKAY LET'S GO TO YOU CENTER DOLLARS. THANK YOU ISSUE CARE. SO LOOK I THINK THIS IS A THE BILL THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN I'LL JUST TELL YOU THAT I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE FACT THAT FACT I DID A RECYCLING BILL FOR. ELECTRIC CARS LIKE WHAT'S THE PLAN AND IT'S A STUDY BILL AND GOT PASS GOT SIGNED LAW BUT I THINK. MY QUESTION TO YOU IS. FROM MY OBSERVATIONS BILL FOR FATHERS HEFTY FINES NUMBER ONE I THINK THAT ARE. OUTRAGEOUS AND WHAT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE GOT TO GET THE JOB DONE WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING FIRES AND THAT AND WE HAVE A- REASONABLE. AMOUNT OF. THE OF THE CONSUMER BUY IN BECAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU JUST HAPPEN TO IT TO MANUFACTURE THE MANUFACTURE BY AS WELL YOU WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO HAVE YOU. IF THE ANSWER TO ME HOW WE GONNA STOP THE FIRES. THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN YOU IF YOU THROW THESE ALL IN THE SAME BAND YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR FIRE. AND SO WHAT'S THE THOUGHT PROCESS ON. THAT WOULD BASICALLY WHERE DOES SHIFTING LIABILITIES WHAT I HEARD THE TESTIMONY OF AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SHIFTING LIABILITY I'M INTERESTED IN FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY CYCLE IS VERY SAFELY. AND THAT YOU KNOW WE GET BUY IN FROM THE PUBLIC. AT APPRECIATE THAT SIR. SO I DON'T THINK THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO SHIFT LIABILITY IT'S- YOU KNOW IT'S PROBABLY NOT TO CREATE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. RACHEL IS SO I WOULD KIND OF STIPULATED THIS IS A HARD PROBLEM TO SOLVE. RIGHT I MEAN AS AS I THINK I MENTIONED MY TESTIMONY. THESE PRODUCTS ARE UBIQUITOUS- AND IF THERE IS NO CENTRALIZED SYSTEM AT THE MOMENT THAT IS WORKING CLEARLY IT IS NOT WORKING- IF WE'RE GETTING ELEVEN BATTERY LITHIUM ION BATTERIES PER HOUR IN IN WASTE. MANAGEMENT FACILITIES. BACK TO MISTER GOVERNOR'S POINT ABOUT- YOU KNOW SOME BATTERIES BEING TOO LARGE THAT THE YOU KNOW DO YOU CAN DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT- YOU CAN ALSO DESIGN PROGRAMS WERE THOSE. THE BINS WILL BE EMPTIED ON A REGULAR BASIS SO WOULD PREVENT. YOU KNOW THOSE SORTS OF- RISKY SCENARIOS. BUT THIS IS A CLEAR IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. WHERE WE START IS TO YOUR POINT WE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM THAT IS DESPERATELY IN NEED OF. ADDRESSING IN CALIFORNIA THE ANSWER WE'VE BEEN GLAD TO WORK WITH. ALL STAKEHOLDERS SO FAR GLAD TO CONTINUE DOING THAT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S COMMON TO THE EXPERIENCE OF MOST OF THE CPR PROGRAMS- THAT IT'S AN AREA PROCESS AND MY GOAL AT THE END OF THE DAY IS TO GET. TO A POINT WHERE MANUFACTURERS ESPECIALLY BUT ALSO RETAILERS. CAN UNDERSTAND- AND PARTICIPATE. IN A PROGRAM IT MAKES SENSE TO THEM AS WELL. SO WITH MADE HOW HOW DO YOU JUST. OF YOU BABY- GOT A CALL. I GUESS MAYBE NEED LIKE THE WORD. LIABILITY TRANSFER BUT YOU BASICALLY ARE SAYING TO THE MANUFACTURE AND TO THE RETAILER THAT THEY GOT TO DEAL WITH IT INSTEAD OF AT THE- AT THE- WASTE RECEIVING A POINT. WHAT CHART I MEAN DIDN'T ALWAYS BETTER TO MAKE THEIR WAY YOU KNOW TO SOME SORT OF WASTE MANAGEMENT PROCESS WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS FOR THEM TO BE INTERMINGLED YOU KNOW WITH COMMON HOUSEHOLD TRASH- AND SO THAT'S THE EIGHT THINK THAT'S INHERENT IN THE DESIGN HERE SO I IT YEAH I DON'T WANT TO GET IN ARGUMENTS SEMANTICS BUT WE DO WE DO WANT TO SHIFT RESPONSIBILITY- YOU KNOW HAVE LIABILITY COMES WITH THAT I THINK WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM PROPERLY THAT WE CAN WE CAN ADDRESS QUESTIONS OF LIABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NO UNDUE EXPOSURE. SO THIS IS THE POLICY COMMITTEE WHERE WE TALK ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AND THEN AND- SO FOR THE DETAIL OF IT WE DIDN'T HAVE TOO MUCH. TROUBLE UNTIL WE HAD AYE ON LITHIUM WHICH IS WHAT'S CAUSING. IT TYPICALLY IF YOU PUT. THE EVER READY FLASHLIGHT BATTERY. BECAUSE THEY WERE THE ONES THAT REALLY CAUSES TIME THAT THE IN THAT REALLY BECAUSE OF THE FIRES AND SO NOW WE HAVE MIXTURE OF ALL THOSE IN IS BECAUSE AND THISWAS WHERE WE TALK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THIS BILL ACTUALLY PILLS THE TWO THOUSAND AND- SIX. RECYCLING MANDATE THAT WE HAD AVAILABLE AND SO. I THINK WE'RE I THINK THIS NEEDS SOME WORK IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY I DON'T THINK WERE I THINK THE OPPOSITION HAS SOME LEGITIMATE- SADISTIC THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND I. AND I'M NOT INTERESTED IN SHIFTING LIABILITY I'M INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY GETTING THE JOB DONE. AND IF IT'S EDUCATING- SOMETHING ON PACKAGING THAT SAYS HEY THIS HAS AYE ON THE THEME BATTERY IN IT CAN'T BE SO I'M SURE THAT'S ALREADY THERE. BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING SO WE NEED TO DO AN EDUCATION. PROCESS TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL THAT THESE CAN BECAUSE THEY THEY ARE CAUSING FIRES I SHOULD SAY. BUT IT ALL WE'RE DOING IN MY OPINION THIS BILL IS JUST TRANSFERRING. WHERE THE FIRES ARE GONNA START EITHER GUNFIGHT STARTED TO. RETAILER WHETHER RECYCLING THERE OR THEY'RE GOING TO AND START AT THE PLACE WHERE THEY'RE YOU KNOW LEVIN TODAY SO FOR ME I'M A NO. UNTIL WE GET A LITTLE BETTER DETAIL AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO BRING ALONG THE MANUFACTURERS. AND THE RETAILERS- IN THIS CONVERSATION I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE MINUTES AT THE- OPPOSITION DRAFTED BUT I'M HOPING THEY'LL GIVE ME A COPY THOSE- SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT THOSE IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. I MEAN I KNOW THE BILL'S HAVING JUDICIARY NEXT I THINK THAT'S WHERE SOME OF THOSE- ISSUES OF CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE RECIPE. YEAH NO I UNDERSTAND I DON'T KNOW YOUR YOUR YOUR- YOUR APPS WITHIN YOUR RIGHTS TO ME THANK GOODNESS. YES MATT A LOT OF THOSE MEETINGS BE IF YOU'RE INTO. AT ALL RIGHT- GO TO CENTER AGAINST THE- GOOD MORE AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY BILL BEFORE US I AM CURIOUS SOME OF YOUR- ADVOCATES OPPOSE A- BOTTLE RECYCLE. EXTENDED PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY AND FIND THAT- THE OTHER ADVOCACY AS SUCH I HAVE A QUESTION ON YOUTH MODEL THIS AFTER THE NEEDLES. AND SHARPS BILL WHICH IS A DIFFERENT AND PRODUCT MEAN WE NOBODY WANTS TO TOUCH SOMEBODY ISSUES NEEDLE BUT AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LASSEN COUNTY IS SAID TO A LOT OF THESE BATTERIES UNLESS YOU'VE GOT SOME SORT OF PRESSURE THERE'S GOOD THERE'S NO FIRE THEY'RE SAFE. YOU COULD PUT THEM IN A CHURCH SO D. HERE BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE PRETTY PRESCRIPTIVE ON I'M ON PAGE THREE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU KNOW THE RETAILERS WERE FEASIBLE. SERVICE AN AUTHORIZED COLLECTOR SO I GUESS EQUIPMENT THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS ONE WITH A RETAIL OUTLET NOT BE FEASIBLE TO COLLECT BATTERIES. WHAT DO YOU ENVISION THAT THEY WOULD DO IT AND THEN WHY WOULD YOU NOT ALLOW THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM THE PEOPLE TESTED TO GO CRAZY I MEAN THERE'S- NOT NOT GEARING IT TOWARDS NEEDLES AND SAY OKAY WE NEED ALL THE SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND WHO'S GOING TO HANDLE THEM. BUT BRING THEM TO YOUR CHURCH YOUR SYNAGOGUE OR TEMPLE WHATEVER YOU GET WHATEVER YOU GOT TO COLLECT THESE THINGS SCHOOLS WHY WOULD YOU NOT WHAT WHY WOULD YOU NOT HAVE MET TO SCHOOLS SO. THAT'S WHAT IS NOT FEASIBLE ABOUT THE RETAILERS I GUESS THE WAY I'M READING THE TEXT I'M SORRY THE SENATE WOULD WHAT IS NOT FEASIBLE- PROVIDED SOME LEEWAY FOR. IN A PROGRAM DEFINITION BUT I DATE I THINK IT'S PRESUME THAT YOU KNOW MOST RETAILERS WHO DEAL AND LET THE LION OF THE BATTERIES. WOULD WOULD BE PRESUMED THESE FEASIBLE RIGHT THE MINUTE THEY DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IS TO CREATE AN END TO END SYSTEM THAT HAS BALANCE NOT UNLIKE THAT YOU DON'T PLEASE DON'T HOLD IT AGAINST ME- YOU KNOW THE RECYCLING OF BOTTLES. THAT AND SO I YOU KNOW THE DISTINCTION YOU'RE MAKING BETWEEN THE NEW PROGRAM AND THIS PROGRAM. NO I WOULD ARGUE IS THE SORT OF INCIDENTAL WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A DRESS. A SERIOUS PROBLEM WHERE YOU HAVE THE UBIQUITOUS PRODUCT- AND THERE'S NO YOU KNOW SORT OF LIKE BALANCE NETWORK THAT THAT THAT EXISTS TO ENSURE YOU KNOW THEIR THEIR ULTIMATE DISPOSAL RIGHT THROUGH YOU KNOW THROUGH THE PRODUCT LIFECYCLE TO. DATE THE RETURN OF SOME YOU KNOW SAFE DISPOSAL MECHANISM. AND SO I DO I DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE ALLOWED THAT YOU KNOW PUTTING THEM INTO DANCE IS NOT GONNA CAUSE A FIGHT EVERY TIME THAT'S NOT WHAT CAUSES THE FIRES. WHAT CAUSES THE FIRES AS THEIR INTERMINGLED WITH WITH OTHER KINDS OF. WASTE AND THEN THEIR CRUSHER OTHERWISE DAMAGED BUT IT'S AND I ALSO POINT OUT THAT DID YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE THE IMPETUS FOR SOLVING THIS PROBLEM BUT BUT OTHER KINDS OF BATTERY KIND OF CONVENTION THAT RISK. POSED AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DANGER RIGHTS OF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG. WITH SOLVING THIS PROBLEM COLLECTIVELY AND SO- YOU KNOW THE STATE TO YOUR POINT OF AT STATE WHAT YOU PLAN. BY A KNOW THIS IS A PAUL COMMITTEE WE HAVE BEEN. TO WORK WITH- ALL. VERTICALLY UP. TO GET TO. OF GOTTEN THERE YET BUT- YOU KNOW MORE THAN TO GET TO DOING SO THIS THIS WILL GO TO- ARE- THE OTHER HOUSING WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON IT THAT'S THAT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE EXPERIENCE I THINK WITH TWO TWELVE. I TO MY POINT WAS THAT NEEDLES AND SYRINGES HAVE A CERTAIN LIMITATION. AND MODELING THE PROGRAM AFTER THAT THAT HAS LIMITATION I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THE COLLECTION OF THE BATTERIES WUNSCH SEGREGATE THEM FROM OTHER HARMFUL. AND THE- THE PICK UP IN THE STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM CAN DESIGN THAT IS GOING TO CREATE. A HARM DEBT THAT I CAN THINK OF RIGHT NOW YOU'RE ALSO NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM RIGHT IF THEY IF THEY'RE STILL DECENTRALIZED RADIANCE OF THE YOU KNOW THERE'S TWO COMPONENTS TO IT CONSIDERS THE SAFETY. BUT THERE'S ALSO CREATING A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. RIGHT WHERE AND DOES DOES PRODUCTS GET RE DIRECTED TOWARD YOU KNOW SOME DID YOU KNOW DISPOSAL SOURCE. SO IF YOU JUST ASSUME THAT'S AFFECTING WHAT WE DO NOW WE KNOW THAT CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE. IN RENO ABOUT ELECTRONIC RECYCLING CAMPAIGNS IT IS. NOT SOLVING THE PROBLEM. RIGHT NOW. THAT SERVICE IS ATTEMPTED THAT ON A GONNA MORE. NATURE OF SYSTEMIC. OKAY ON PAGE FOUR OF OUR STAFF REPORT UNDER J. FOR TALKING ABOUT THE- EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TASK FORCE. AND RECYCLING IN AREAS AND COMMUNITIES THAT FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT. WHAT DO WHAT'D. UNDER THIS SYSTEM WHAT WITH THAT WHAT WHAT DOES HE NEED CHALLENGES BE. BUT THEN THEY JUST DON'T RECYCLE. I MEAN THAT MIGHT HAVE CHALLENGE CHALLENGE THAT WAS JUST A MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO- THE SAME KIND OF WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS WE DO THEM AND HAVE ACCESS TO RETAILERS SO AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THAT CONTINUE KEPT UP CAME UP- MOST THE FOLKS HERE IN THE CAPITAL GET USED TO RECYCLING OF BATTERIES HERE. RIGHT THERE WAS THE BEEN BY THE ELEVATOR AND SO WHEN THE CAPITAL WAS CLOSED NOBODY KNEW WHERE TO TAKE THEIR BATTERIES YEAH AND I THINK YOU HAVE YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM IN MANY COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY THEY SIMPLY DON'T KNOW THERE IS NO OBVIOUS EVEN IF THERE'S NO OBVIOUS DESTINATION SO THE GOAL IS. TO WORK WITH US COMMUNITIES THERE'S A BROADER- COMPONENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AWARENESS THAT'S THAT'S EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE BILL YEAH AND SO WE WOULD DO THOSE THINGS TO TRY AGAIN TO DESIGN A SYSTEM EFFECTIVELY FROM SCRATCH. THAT THAT ADDRESSES. THIS THIS VERY CHALLENGING PROBLEM. RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SAY I. YOUR HAVE. THE PRODUCERS EXTEND CREATE A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASY COLLECTED AT EVERY EVERY PLACE SO I ASSUME THAT THE SAME TYPE OF COLLECTIONS IN THE GROCERY STORES OR THE CHURCHES WERE IF IT WERE TO GO TO- GET EXTENDED TO OTHERS. DEREK I WE WANT TO CREATE REGIONAL INCENTIVES FOR PRODUCERS TO REACH OUT. TO THEM. FOR RECYCLING. OKAY THAT'S ALL I HAVE MISTER. OKAY- WE ASK YOU WHAT WHAT IS YOUR THOUGHT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS D. C. MODEL AND SENATOR AND WHAT WE MIGHT GET A LEARN FROM THEM I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT ALREADY BUT- SO YOU KNOW IT MIGHT. EXPERIENCES FOR MICROSERVICES FOLKS WHO WOULD BE A WE THE SUPPORTERS MY OFFICE VIEWS THE DC MODEL AS A GOOD REFERENCE POINT IN ANALOG AYE AYE I'M NOT TOTALLY SURE MISTER GOVERNOR FIRST TO THAT DID YOU KNOW THEY PROPOSED SOMETHING EQUIPMENT TO IT WE DID AND WE REJECTED OUT OF HAND I THINK QUITE THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE- WE THINK IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD REFERENCE POINT- AND SO THE OTHER PROBABLY DIFFERENCES THAT ARE INTRINSIC TO CALIFORNIA- BUT WE'RE IN A WOULD LIKE TO WORK VERY HARD AND INTERRUPTING SOMETHING THAT'S APPROPRIATE OR STATE THAT. DIED IN MERE IS A SUCCESS THE SCENE TO SHOOT. BLACKROCK HOW DO YOU BRING YOU CAN YOU. OKAY I MEAN I KNOW ALL THESE ALL THESE BILLS ARE WORK IN PROGRESS AND AGO SHE ARE ALWAYS TRICKY- CERTAINLY HOPE YOU CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE A FRUITFUL DIALOGUE. AS A THING WAS A LONG TERM- I'M BY MALES TIME OBVIOUSLY MYSELF INVOLVED WITH THE PEER CONVERSATIONS AND- SEVERAL OF SO YOU KNOW MISTER JUST TELL YOU KNOW COMPLICATED IS ALL THE WAY THROUGH- AND WE ACCEPT THAT AS MY RECORDS AB AND WILL CONTINUE TO SEND REGULAR. AND SO HERE I DON'T THINK ANY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM- AND SO THE TO THE BEAUTIFUL LET'S SAY PROCESSES WILL HAVE MULTIPLE YOU KNOW CHECKPOINTS AT WHICH TO REGAIN YOUR SUCCESS AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- TO TAKE NOT JUST THERE THERE ARE OBJECTIONS INTO ACCOUNT BUT ALSO THE REALITY.
