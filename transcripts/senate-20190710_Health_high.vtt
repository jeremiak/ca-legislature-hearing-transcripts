TO PUNT.

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.073
AND THEY MAY FIND PUBLIC SAFETY

INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED THEM BUT

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:13.719
NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFESAVING

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.354
COMMUNITY TREATMENT WHICH CAN

00:09:15.421 --> 00:09:16.822
HELP PREVENT INDIVIDUALS FROM

BEING INCARCERATED IN THE FIRST

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:21.594
PLACE -- IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:22.228
THAT A PILOT PROGRAM WITH THIS

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.530
TIME LIMITED WITH EVALUATION.

00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.032

THE IMPACT OF THESE JAIL BASED

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.036

SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:09:42.615 --> 00:09:44.583
WE BELIEVE THAT A PILOT PROGRAM

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:46.319
FOR THIS PURPOSE WOULD ALLOW

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.386
ORANGE COUNTY AND OTHER

00:09:47.453 --> 00:09:49.088

WHICH WHICH PROVES MY POINT THE

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:11.871
POINT IS IS THAT THIS IS

00:11:11.937 --> 00:11:13.606
PROBABLY THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.574
PLACE TO PROVIDE TREATMENT TERMS

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.976

BECAUSE THE RESTRICTION IS

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.255
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK

00:15:23.322 --> 00:15:24.790

BASIS.

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:17.220
THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR LINE

00:49:17.287 --> 00:49:18.855
RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT WHAT

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:19.890
HAPPENED SO WHAT HAPPENS IF

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:21.325
SOMEONE MAKES A CAPITATED

00:49:21.391 --> 00:49:22.192
AGREEMENT.

00:49:22.259 --> 00:49:23.960
AND IT TURNS OUT THEY MADE SOME

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:26.563
BAD DECISIONS AND NOW THE GROUP

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.765
OR WHATEVER SAYS OH WELL YOU

00:49:28.832 --> 00:49:29.333
KNOW WE CAN'T MAKE IT WORK

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:30.300

00:49:31.735 --> 00:49:32.803
PATIENTS GETTING STUCK IN THE

00:49:32.869 --> 00:49:34.504

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.208
ENTITIES WHO MAY HAVE MADE BAD.

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.576
BUSINESS DECISIONS THERE OR

00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:41.311
WHATEVER ACTUARY WEARABLE DIDN'T

WORK IT OUT AND NOW THEY FOUND

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:43.680
THEMSELVES AT THE WRONG END OF

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:44.414
THE STICK.

00:49:44.481 --> 00:49:46.183
AND EITHER THEY CAN'T KEEP GOING

00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:47.284
OR THEY DON'T WANT TO KEEP GOING

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.819
AND PEOPLE BAIL RIGHT AND THEN

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:50.220
WHAT HAPPENS.

00:49:50.287 --> 00:49:51.655
SO WE CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE

00:49:51.722 --> 00:49:52.789
ONE GROUP SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT

00:49:52.856 --> 00:49:53.757

SOLVENCY STANDARDS BECAUSE THIS

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:07.104
IS ABOUT TRANSFERRING RISK

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.004

01:59:15.681 --> 01:59:17.416
HOW MUCH WE AGREE THAT -- THE

01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.418
CURRENT LICENSING PROCESS AND

01:59:19.485 --> 01:59:22.088
CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP PROCESS FOR

01:59:22.154 --> 01:59:24.190
OF FACILITIES THAT ARE UNDER --

01:59:24.257 --> 01:59:25.491
THE JURISDICTION APARTMENT

01:59:25.558 --> 01:59:27.460
PUBLIC HEALTH IS BROKEN --

01:59:27.527 --> 01:59:30.096
CURRENTLY -- THE AVERAGE TIME IT

01:59:30.162 --> 01:59:31.764
TAKES FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO

01:59:31.831 --> 01:59:33.733
APPROVE A LICENSURE APPLICATION

01:59:33.799 --> 01:59:35.401
IS A YEAR AND FOUR MONTHS.

01:59:35.468 --> 01:59:36.502
WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED

01:59:36.569 --> 01:59:38.137
APPLICATIONS FOR SKILLED NURSING

01:59:38.204 --> 01:59:39.205
FACILITIES PENDING WITH THE

01:59:39.272 --> 01:59:40.873
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW SOME HAVE

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:44.343
BEEN WAITING FOR FOR YEARS -- IT

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:45.811
SHOULD NOT.

01:59:45.878 --> 01:59:48.581
IT SHOULD NOT BE THAT WAY -- AND

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:50.416
THAT IS WHY WE HAVE A PROCESS

01:59:50.483 --> 01:59:52.952
WHEREBY -- A NEW A NEW OWNER

01:59:53.019 --> 01:59:54.620
NEEDS TO STEP IN BECAUSE YOU

01:59:54.687 --> 01:59:56.088
HAVE A FACILITY THAT STRUGGLING

01:59:56.155 --> 01:59:57.423
AND SO THEY START AS AN AN

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:58.991
INTERIM MANAGER.

01:59:59.058 --> 02:00:00.126
AND THEN ENTER MANAGER THAN

02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:01.961
DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE

02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:03.563
MEDICAID FUNDS THAT COME THROUGH

02:00:03.629 --> 02:00:04.864
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM THOSE ARE

02:00:04.931 --> 02:00:06.432
STILL GOING TO THE PREVIOUS

02:00:06.499 --> 02:00:07.133
OWNER.

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:09.068
SO THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE A DELAY

02:00:09.135 --> 02:00:11.437
IN -- PAYCHECKS GOING OUT FUNDS

02:00:11.504 --> 02:00:14.807
BEING AVAILABLE -- AND I WOULD

02:00:14.874 --> 02:00:16.342
SAY ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE --

02:00:16.409 --> 02:00:18.311
NURSING FACILITIES THAT ARE OVER

02:00:18.377 --> 02:00:20.413
YOU KNOW ALMOST 70% FUNDED BY

02:00:20.479 --> 02:00:21.714
THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:23.416
WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE FOR THEIR

02:00:23.482 --> 02:00:25.151
FUNDED WELL ENOUGH TO PROVIDE

02:00:25.217 --> 02:00:28.087
THE SERVICES AND THE ADEQUATE --

02:00:28.154 --> 02:00:29.922
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED -- SO WE

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.390
HAVE FROM THE BEGINNING BEEN

02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.059
SUPPORTIVE OF THE TWO MAIN

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:33.960
ANIMAL ELEMENTS OF THE BILL

02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:40.099
WHICH ALLOW FOR PRE NOTICE.

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:41.200
AND ALSO -- ALLOW FOR RETENTION

02:00:41.267 --> 02:00:42.234
AND SO WE'VE BEEN -- PLEASED TO

02:00:42.301 --> 02:00:43.302
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

02:00:43.369 --> 02:00:44.770
WITH THE AUTHOR ON BOTH OF THOSE.

02:00:44.837 --> 02:00:47.139
ARE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN WAS THAT

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.075

02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:53.579
THEY WON'T BEAT IT WE HOPE THAT

02:00:53.646 --> 02:00:55.448
THEY DO -- BUT HISTORICALLY THEY

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:57.249
HAVE NOT AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.484
THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT THAT

02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:00.786
THAT'S BEEN TAKEN -- THAT ALLOWS

02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:02.054
FOR THE APPLICATION PROCESS THE

02:01:02.121 --> 02:01:03.456
CURRENT APPLICATION PROCESS TO

02:01:03.522 --> 02:01:05.157
GO THROUGH -- IF THE DEPARTMENT

02:01:05.224 --> 02:01:06.525

02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:09.629
