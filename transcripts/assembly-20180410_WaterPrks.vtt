GOING TO GOODNESS GOV LIKE

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:24.830 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK ISN'T AB

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:25.230 region:rollup2
TWENTY NINE FIFTY

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.898 region:rollup2
SEVEN.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.401 region:rollup2
WHICH COULD CREATE A WATER

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:30.502 region:rollup2
INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY.

00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:32.437 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:29:30.502 --> 00:29:34.940 region:rollup2
IN THE OROVILLE AREA.

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:36.208 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY OR THOSE

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:38.210 region:rollup2
AT A LOT OF ATTENTION BECAUSE OF

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:38.910 region:rollup2
THE.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:40.379 region:rollup2
THE DAMN BUT.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.812 region:rollup2
HE ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT OF THIS

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:41.146 region:rollup2
IS THE AREA WHERE.

00:29:40.812 --> 00:29:42.781 region:rollup2
.

00:29:41.146 --> 00:29:45.384 region:rollup2
MOST OF THE WATER IS COLLECTED

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:47.886 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA TWENTY

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:49.421 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX MILLION PEOPLE. ARE

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:50.122 region:rollup2
RELY ON THE WATER OUT OF OR

00:29:49.421 --> 00:29:52.024 region:rollup2
VILLAINOUS.

00:29:50.122 --> 00:29:52.624 region:rollup2
AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WE KNOW

00:29:52.024 --> 00:29:53.525 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO DO IN IMPROVE

00:29:52.624 --> 00:29:56.828 region:rollup2
OUR INNOVATION.

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:59.231 region:rollup2
AND CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY.

00:29:56.828 --> 00:30:00.966 region:rollup2
WITH WATER. AND SO WHAT THIS

00:29:59.231 --> 00:30:03.001 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD DO THIS IS TO CREATE

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:04.369 region:rollup2
A A WATER TECHNOLOGY HUB AND THE

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:06.004 region:rollup2
OROVILLE AREA WHERE THERE WOULD

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:06.705 region:rollup2
BE TAX INCENTIVES TO CREATE. NEW

00:30:06.004 --> 00:30:09.741 region:rollup2
WATER.

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:11.243 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY CONSERVATION.

TIME.

00:30:13.478 --> 00:30:14.279 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:30:13.712 --> 00:30:16.214 region:rollup2
ME I THINK THIS IS A GOOD

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:17.783 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO

00:30:16.214 --> 00:30:18.850 region:rollup2
DEVELOP ON ON THINGS THAT WE.

00:30:17.783 --> 00:30:20.052 region:rollup2
IT WE ALREADY HAVE DONE ACTUALLY

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:22.754 region:rollup2
HAD OF MY DISTRICT.

00:30:20.052 --> 00:30:24.056 region:rollup2
.

00:30:22.754 --> 00:30:25.023 region:rollup2
A YOUNG MAN ACTUALLY OUT OF THE

00:30:24.056 --> 00:30:27.759 region:rollup2
NAVAL ACADEMY.

00:30:25.023 --> 00:30:29.728 region:rollup2
OF FROM THE CHICO AREA WHO HAD.

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:30.829 region:rollup2
DEVELOP A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT

00:30:29.728 --> 00:30:32.497 region:rollup2
TAKES DIRTY WATER AND MAKES IN

00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:34.766 region:rollup2
THE CLEAN WATER AND I ACTUALLY

00:30:32.497 --> 00:30:36.968 region:rollup2
TAKES INTO AND EVEN SALT WATER

00:30:34.766 --> 00:30:38.603 region:rollup2
MAKES INTO CLEAN WATER USING.

00:30:36.968 --> 00:30:41.373 region:rollup2
LESS ENERGY NOW THAT TECHNOLOGY

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:44.609 region:rollup2
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. AND IT'S

00:30:41.373 --> 00:30:45.110 region:rollup2
NOT BE A TOTALLY READY FOR.

00:30:44.609 --> 00:30:45.744 region:rollup2
MASS PRODUCTION YEAH.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:49.748 region:rollup2
BUT HE ENDED UP TAKING THAT

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:51.383 region:rollup2
BUSINESS AND IDEA TO TEXAS.

00:30:49.748 --> 00:30:53.185 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE OF THE BETTER.

00:30:51.383 --> 00:30:54.853 region:rollup2
INCENTIVES THAT HE COULD GET

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.288 region:rollup2
THERE TO TO START UP THAT.

00:30:54.853 --> 00:30:58.256 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA SO.

00:30:56.288 --> 00:30:59.491 region:rollup2
I'D RATHER KEEP THOSE

00:30:58.256 --> 00:31:01.526 region:rollup2
INNOVATORS HERE. AND USE THAT

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:03.895 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY FOR CALIFORNIA AND

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.496 region:rollup2
ALSO BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY AND SO

00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:04.830 region:rollup2

00:31:49.808 --> 00:31:51.743 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW REALLY THE WHY I'M

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:53.645 region:rollup2
FOCUSING ON THAT BECAUSE THAT IS

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:55.647 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY WHERE MOST OF OUR WATER

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:56.515 region:rollup2
IS COLLECTED AND STORED IN IN

00:31:55.647 --> 00:31:58.517 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:31:56.515 --> 00:32:00.519 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMED LIKE AN

00:31:58.517 --> 00:32:01.753 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE PLACE YOU KNOW THESE

00:32:00.519 --> 00:32:02.788 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGIES CAN THEN BE.

00:32:01.753 --> 00:32:04.022 region:rollup2
AND OTHER DEVELOPED THEIR CAN

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:05.791 region:rollup2
THEN BE BROUGHT OUT INTO THE

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:07.225 region:rollup2
SYSTEM YOU KNOW THERE'S ALSO THE

00:32:05.791 --> 00:32:08.860 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO TEST.

00:32:07.225 --> 00:32:10.595 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THINGS I THINK A LOT

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.097 region:rollup2
MORE EASILY.

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.931 region:rollup2
IN THE IN THE OROVILLE AREA

00:32:12.097 --> 00:32:13.932 region:rollup2
WHERE WE HAVE.

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:15.734 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER THINGS

00:32:13.932 --> 00:32:17.235 region:rollup2
IN PLACE.

00:32:15.734 --> 00:32:20.238 region:rollup2
SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE IMPETUS

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:21.706 region:rollup2
BEHIND IT.

00:32:20.238 --> 00:32:22.841 region:rollup2
IN THE WINTER TALK ABOUT THE TAX

00:32:21.706 --> 00:32:26.812 region:rollup2
CREDIT THOUGHT.

NUMBER OF YEARS WE'VE HAD A LOT

OF CHALLENGES WITH BLUE GREEN

00:41:31.556 --> 00:41:34.092 region:rollup2
ALGAE BLOOMS WE'VE HAD BLOOMS.

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:36.194 region:rollup2
OF FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BUT THE

00:41:34.092 --> 00:41:36.594 region:rollup2
FIRST TOXIC BLOOM WE HAD WAS IN

00:41:36.194 --> 00:41:38.629 region:rollup2
TWENTY FOURTEEN.

00:41:36.594 --> 00:41:40.131 region:rollup2
AND THAT RESULTED IN THE CLOSURE

00:41:38.629 --> 00:41:41.132 region:rollup2
OF ONE OF OUR LAKES AND AROUND

00:41:40.131 --> 00:41:43.334 region:rollup2
THAT SAME TIME THAT.

00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:44.102 region:rollup2
THAT'S TIME WE HAD A DOG THREE

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:45.636 region:rollup2
DOG BEST THAT LECTURE ABOUT

00:41:44.102 --> 00:41:45.903 region:rollup2
WHERE THE TIME. AND THAT WAS

00:41:45.636 --> 00:41:47.739 region:rollup2
DESPITE.

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:48.272 region:rollup2
SIGNAGE NOTIFICATION TO THE

00:41:47.739 --> 00:41:49.874 region:rollup2
PUBLIC AND TESTING WE WERE

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:52.210 region:rollup2
DOING.

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:54.212 region:rollup2

00:41:52.210 --> 00:41:55.446 region:rollup2
WITH THE PEOPLE STILL OUT ME AND

00:41:54.212 --> 00:41:56.714 region:rollup2
GOT TO THE EDGE OF THE WATER IN

AND AND UNFORTUNATELY.

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:59.484 region:rollup2
WE HAD THESE NEGATIVE

00:41:58.216 --> 00:42:01.152 region:rollup2
CONSEQUENCES SO WE REALLY HAD TO

00:41:59.484 --> 00:42:02.820 region:rollup2
STEP UP OUR MONITORING PROGRAM I

00:42:01.152 --> 00:42:04.722 region:rollup2
DO A LOT MORE MONITORING A

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:05.957 region:rollup2

A AND DO ALL THE TESTING AND

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:12.964 region:rollup2
NOTIFICATION NOW ALL THIS IS

00:42:11.129 --> 00:42:15.533 region:rollup2
BEEN POSSIBLE BY USING NATIONAL

00:42:12.964 --> 00:42:16.334 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE AND A WORK WITH THE

00:42:15.533 --> 00:42:17.402 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCIES.

00:42:16.334 --> 00:42:18.703 region:rollup2
BUT OFTEN OF THEIR TIME IS

00:42:17.402 --> 00:42:20.204 region:rollup2
LIMITED AND THE AN EFFORT

00:42:18.703 --> 00:42:22.173 region:rollup2
DISEASE USING STUDIES FROM OTHER

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:23.207 region:rollup2
AREAS AND THIS TASK FORCE WOULD

00:42:22.173 --> 00:42:23.708 region:rollup2
BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN

00:42:23.207 --> 00:42:25.476 region:rollup2
COORDINATING A STATEWIDE

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:27.378 region:rollup2
EFFORTS.

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:28.413 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VERY QUALIFIED TAFF

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.081 region:rollup2
AT THE WATER BOARD AND AT THE

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT

00:42:31.182 --> 00:42:34.118 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THE EFFORTS AREN'T

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:35.853 region:rollup2
COORDINATED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:36.921 region:rollup2
AND. ARE WE WOULD BE A STRONG

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:38.256 region:rollup2
PARTNER IN THAT AND WE'VE BEEN

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:39.624 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THOSE AGENCIES BUT

00:42:38.256 --> 00:42:41.426 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE TO SEE.

00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:42.827 region:rollup2
THIS EFFORTS COORDINATED UP ON

00:42:41.426 --> 00:42:44.362 region:rollup2
A STATEWIDE BASIS BUT OF THE

00:42:42.827 --> 00:42:45.296 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT'S GOING AND HOW TO

00:42:44.362 --> 00:42:48.099 region:rollup2
TREAT THESE BLOOMS THE HAD

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:49.267 region:rollup2
REDUCE TOXIN FORMATION IS. JUST

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED AND WOULD LIKE

00:42:49.267 --> 00:42:50.301 region:rollup2
THE STATE REALLY BECOME A

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:52.670 region:rollup2
LEADER.

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:55.006 region:rollup2
IT IN THIS EFFORT TO COORDINATE

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.941 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND.

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:58.476 region:rollup2
DATA AND BETTER HELP DEVELOP

00:42:56.941 --> 00:43:01.345 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS FOR NOTIFICATION AND

00:42:58.476 --> 00:43:03.147 region:rollup2
AND STOPPING THESE TOXIC BLOOMS.

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:05.049 region:rollup2
IT'S THAT RECREATIONAL DIVIDE

00:43:03.147 --> 00:43:06.050 region:rollup2
IS ESSENTIAL TO THE BAY AREA AND

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:08.019 region:rollup2
A VERY IMPORTANT.

00:43:06.050 --> 00:43:10.088 region:rollup2
TO THAT THE AND AND THE TOWNS

00:43:08.019 --> 00:43:11.422 region:rollup2
ARE FACING ARE BEING EXPERIENCED

00:43:10.088 --> 00:43:12.957 region:rollup2
A WIDE THOUGH OF IT'S SOMETHING

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:14.392 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING BUT THAT

00:43:12.957 --> 00:43:16.060 region:rollup2
THE FREQUENCY OF THESE BLOOMS.

00:43:14.392 --> 00:43:17.161 region:rollup2
OF HAS BEEN LASTING MUCH LONGER

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.296 region:rollup2
AND AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER

00:43:17.161 --> 00:43:18.796 region:rollup2
STATED THAT THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:43:18.296 --> 00:43:21.032 region:rollup2
SEEING THESE.

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:21.833 region:rollup2
EH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOW

00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:22.300 region:rollup2
USUALLY THEY WERE IN THE SUMMER

00:43:21.833 --> 00:43:23.468 region:rollup2
I CAN TAILOR AUGUST TO

NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND JANUARY

00:43:27.238 --> 00:43:30.274 region:rollup2
AND SO RESERVOIRS THAT THAT

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:31.576 region:rollup2
DOESN'T AFFECT SWIMMING AS MUCH

00:43:30.274 --> 00:43:34.378 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A AFFECT FISHING INTO

00:43:31.576 --> 00:43:34.946 region:rollup2
OUR RESERVOIRS AND ALSO SOME OF

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:36.848 region:rollup2

AND THE IDEA THIS SPELL IS TO

00:45:18.049 --> 00:45:22.353 region:rollup2
TAKE WHAT THEY HAVE DONE.

00:45:20.818 --> 00:45:24.288 region:rollup2
AND BRING IT FORWARD TO

00:45:22.353 --> 00:45:25.389 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION SO THIS IS A

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:28.125 region:rollup2
REALLY TALKING ABOUT

00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:30.494 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION. I DO NOT KNOW

00:45:28.125 --> 00:45:31.696 region:rollup2
OUR DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THEY'VE

00:45:30.494 --> 00:45:40.605 region:rollup2
TAKEN A LOOK AT THE EFFECT ON

00:45:31.696 --> 00:45:42.974 region:rollup2
THE FROG.

00:45:40.605 --> 00:45:44.842 region:rollup2
YEAH SO THAT WE DON'T KNOW IF

00:45:42.974 --> 00:45:46.310 region:rollup2
THEY'VE LOOKED AT FROGS BUT WE

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:48.412 region:rollup2
DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE LOOKING.

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:49.914 region:rollup2
AT WAYS TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS

00:45:48.412 --> 00:45:51.782 region:rollup2
AND THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY HELP

00:45:49.914 --> 00:45:52.817 region:rollup2
OUT THE FROGS ARE BUT I'LL TRY

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:54.518 region:rollup2
AND FIND OUT MORE AND GET BACK

00:45:52.817 --> 00:45:55.786 region:rollup2
TO YOUR OFFICE

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.587 region:rollup2
OKAY I I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

00:45:55.786 --> 00:45:58.022 region:rollup2
THAT IF IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.523 region:rollup2
STATE'S BEEN MONEY ON DOING

00:45:58.022 --> 00:46:01.025 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ON THE ALGAE. THAT

00:45:59.523 --> 00:46:02.360 region:rollup2
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL ASPECTS.

00:46:01.025 --> 00:46:04.362 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I HAD A LOT OF MY HIGH

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.796 region:rollup2
SIERRA TRAILS CLOSE.

00:46:04.362 --> 00:46:06.998 region:rollup2
OVER YOU KNOW PEOPLE THINKING

00:46:05.796 --> 00:46:09.033 region:rollup2
THAT HUMANS WERE CAUSING THE

00:46:06.998 --> 00:46:10.601 region:rollup2
FROG DEATH WHEN I WAS ACTUALLY

00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:11.802 region:rollup2
THE ALGERIAN THOUGH. IF WE CAN

00:46:10.601 --> 00:46:13.204 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT THE RESEARCH IS

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:15.806 region:rollup2
GOING EVERYWHERE AND. YET WE

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:15.973 region:rollup2
WILL DEFINITELY LOOK INTO THAT

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
AND.

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:19.210 region:rollup2
.

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:20.144 region:rollup2
THAT'S AGAIN IT THEY ARE LOOKING

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:21.746 region:rollup2
AT MITIGATION THAT SHOULD HELP

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:24.181 region:rollup2
IN ANY CASE BUT WILL LOOK

00:46:21.746 --> 00:46:26.450 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE ARE HIGH.

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:30.755 region:rollup2
THE HIGH LAKES IN THE SIERRAS.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:32.056 region:rollup2
THEY WILL ASK ABOUT THAT.

00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:34.358 region:rollup2
OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR

00:46:32.056 --> 00:46:36.260 region:rollup2
COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS.

00:46:34.358 --> 00:46:37.128 region:rollup2
I'M THIS IS. TRIGGERING

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.563 region:rollup2
SOMETHING FOR ME.

00:46:37.128 --> 00:46:41.732 region:rollup2
WHEN I HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE.

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:43.734 region:rollup2
.

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:45.069 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH THERE'S LAKES AND

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:47.004 region:rollup2
RESERVOIRS ARE MANAGED BY

00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:49.440 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:50.675 region:rollup2
UP IN MY OF THE IN MY DISTRICT.

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.976 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE TRYING TO TREAT

00:46:50.675 --> 00:46:53.311 region:rollup2
FOR ALGAL BLOOM AND ONE OF THE

00:46:51.976 --> 00:46:54.945 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THEY RAN INTO IS

00:46:53.311 --> 00:46:56.514 region:rollup2
THAT CERTAIN TREATMENTS THEY'RE

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:58.516 region:rollup2
NOT ABLE TO DO EVEN THOUGH?

00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:59.617 region:rollup2
MUNICIPALITIES ARE ALLOWED TO DO

00:46:58.516 --> 00:47:01.318 region:rollup2
THE TREATMENTS THAT ACTUALLY

00:46:59.617 --> 00:47:03.254 region:rollup2
PRIVATE HOMEOWNERS GROUPS ARE

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:04.522 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOWED TO DO.

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:06.424 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE TREATMENT SAID

00:47:04.522 --> 00:47:06.757 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAD DONE JUST HAD TO

00:47:06.424 --> 00:47:07.258 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH IT.

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.694 region:rollup2
.

00:47:07.258 --> 00:47:12.229 region:rollup2
.

00:47:09.694 --> 00:47:13.531 region:rollup2
THERE WAS AN EFFECT TO FISH FOR

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:14.865 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REASON AND THEN THEY

00:47:13.531 --> 00:47:16.300 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD FISH AND WILDLIFE

00:47:14.865 --> 00:47:17.401 region:rollup2
CAMINO AND SO I KNOW THERE'S

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.937 region:rollup2
BEEN LIKE SOME KIND OF.

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:21.138 region:rollup2
.

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:22.340 region:rollup2
NO THAT ONE A TRY THE

00:47:21.138 --> 00:47:24.709 region:rollup2
COORDINATION I THINK IS

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.710 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT ON THE SO ONE QUESTION

00:47:24.709 --> 00:47:26.310 region:rollup2
HOW DOES HAVE ENOUGH ANYBODY

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:28.512 region:rollup2
KNOWS THIS BUT.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.114 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE TREATMENTS?

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:31.248 region:rollup2
LETTER DONE THE KIND OF COMBAT

00:47:30.114 --> 00:47:33.084 region:rollup2
THE ALGAL BLOOM BLOOM AT THIS

00:47:31.248 --> 00:47:34.719 region:rollup2
POINT.

00:47:33.084 --> 00:47:35.653 region:rollup2
SO A MATT GROW GIVE CHIEF

00:47:34.719 --> 00:47:37.088 region:rollup2
STRICTLY THREE REGIONAL PARK

00:47:35.653 --> 00:47:38.622 region:rollup2
DISTRICT UP SORTING A VARIETY OF

00:47:37.088 --> 00:47:40.291 region:rollup2
THINGS OF THERE'S TWO THINGS YOU

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:42.193 region:rollup2
CAN DO ONE YOU CAN.

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:43.027 region:rollup2
TREAT WITH THEM

00:47:42.193 --> 00:47:44.462 region:rollup2
HIS A BENIGN PRODUCT SOMEBODY

00:47:43.027 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
HYDROPEROXIDE WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:47:44.462 --> 00:47:47.331 region:rollup2
BLOOM LOVE THAT'LL THAT'LL

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:48.232 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE LENGTH OF THE BLOOM

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.333 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS

00:47:48.232 --> 00:47:51.235 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU. A TREAT WITH THE

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:52.336 region:rollup2
HYDROPEROXIDE BASED PRODUCTS IT

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:54.672 region:rollup2
BREAKS THE CELL WALLS AND

00:47:52.336 --> 00:47:55.272 region:rollup2
RELEASES THE TOXINS SO THEN YOU

00:47:54.672 --> 00:47:55.506 region:rollup2
CAN HAVE AN INCREASE PERIOD OF

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:57.108 region:rollup2
TOXIN.

00:47:55.506 --> 00:47:58.576 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION EVEN THOUGH THE

00:47:57.108 --> 00:48:00.478 region:rollup2
ALBUM LOOK BETTER THEY TO LOOK

00:47:58.576 --> 00:48:02.313 region:rollup2
CLEAR ABOUT YOU MADE THE TOXINS

00:48:00.478 --> 00:48:03.881 region:rollup2
IN THE WATER SO WHAT WE FOUND TO

00:48:02.313 --> 00:48:04.782 region:rollup2
BE MORE EFFECTIVE.

00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:06.117 region:rollup2
IN MANY OF OUR AS WE JUST

00:48:04.782 --> 00:48:07.918 region:rollup2
TREATING NUTRIENTS AHEAD OF TIME

00:48:06.117 --> 00:48:08.586 region:rollup2
BECAUSE NUTRIENTS ARE WHAT FEED

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:11.222 region:rollup2
THE BLOOM SEE OF HIGH PHOSPHORUS

00:48:08.586 --> 00:48:12.022 region:rollup2
AND NITROGEN. IN THE RESERVOIRS

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:14.525 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE BEEN PUTTING PRODUCTS.

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:16.093 region:rollup2
IN INTO THE BOTTOM THE LAKE TO

00:48:14.525 --> 00:48:17.561 region:rollup2
FIND THOSE NUTRIENTS ARE NOT

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.529 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO FEED THE ALGAE AND

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:20.197 region:rollup2
THOSE TREATMENT OR MORE

00:48:18.529 --> 00:48:21.966 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE IN THE MORE LONG TERM.

00:48:20.197 --> 00:48:24.034 region:rollup2
BUT I CAN SAY THAT THEY THAT

00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:25.035 region:rollup2
THAT WORK PICK WHAT COORDINATION

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.569 region:rollup2
WITH THE STATE WATER BOARD

00:48:25.035 --> 00:48:27.538 region:rollup2
WHETHER AND PANEL HEALTH

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:28.572 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT A TO GET THE PERMITS

00:48:27.538 --> 00:48:29.840 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT WORK WE'VE BEEN ABLE

00:48:28.572 --> 00:48:30.941 region:rollup2
TO GET THOSE PERMITS BECAUSE

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.276 region:rollup2
REPUBLIC AGENCY BUT I CAN

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:33.944 region:rollup2
IMAGINE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:34.945 region:rollup2
ANOTHER. TRYING TO WALK IN THE

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:36.480 region:rollup2
FRONT DOOR AND COORDINATE WITH

00:48:34.945 --> 00:48:37.581 region:rollup2
THE WATER BOARD AND NOT HAVING

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.350 region:rollup2
THAT SAME LEVEL OF.

00:48:37.581 --> 00:48:41.819 region:rollup2
LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:42.653 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING HADDOCK A COMPLY

00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:43.921 region:rollup2
WITH THESE REGULATIONS

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.790 region:rollup2
THAT ALREADY IN PLACE.

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.824 region:rollup2
IT CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING SO I

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:48.058 region:rollup2
THINK WE HAD THE COORDINATION IS

00:48:46.824 --> 00:48:48.993 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL SOMETHING MAYBE THIS

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.127 region:rollup2
IF FOR SOMEONE IF MOVE FOR MAYBE

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:51.562 region:rollup2
TRYING TO INCLUDE HOMEOWNERS

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:53.998 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATIONS ARE SO DIFFERENT

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:55.266 region:rollup2
PRIVATE GROUPS THAT MIGHT BE

00:48:53.998 --> 00:48:56.867 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH MANAGING.

00:48:55.266 --> 00:48:58.769 region:rollup2
RESERVOIRS AND LAKES RIGHT TED

00:48:56.867 --> 00:49:00.404 region:rollup2
THIS IS CLEARLY VERY IMPORTANT I

00:48:58.769 --> 00:49:02.373 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'LL FIT

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:04.074 region:rollup2
INTO THIS BILL BUT IF IT DOES

00:49:02.373 --> 00:49:05.976 region:rollup2
THEN I PROMISE TO BRING

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:06.477 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BACK NEXT YEAR. A TO

00:49:05.976 --> 00:49:08.979 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

00:49:06.477 --> 00:49:11.649 region:rollup2
LIKES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY OKAY

00:49:08.979 --> 00:49:13.217 region:rollup2
I JUST CAN'T SAY FOR SURE THAT

00:49:11.649 --> 00:49:15.085 region:rollup2
IT A COMPATIBLE WITH WHAT WE'RE

00:49:13.217 --> 00:49:17.054 region:rollup2
DOING HERE. OF BUT IT IS A

00:49:15.085 --> 00:49:17.888 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT I PROMISE I WILL

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:19.557 region:rollup2
GET TO.

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:21.759 region:rollup2
IF NOT THIS YEAR THEN NEXT AND

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:23.294 region:rollup2
AS I UNDERSTAND REALLY YOUR BILL

00:49:21.759 --> 00:49:24.728 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO GET WATER BOARD.

00:49:23.294 --> 00:49:26.330 region:rollup2
TO COORDINATE WITH ALL THESE

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:28.599 region:rollup2
GROUPS ON LIKE THAT SORT OF THE

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:30.701 region:rollup2
A MORE UNIVERSAL WAVE.

00:49:28.599 --> 00:49:32.470 region:rollup2
COMBATING ALGAL BLOOM IS THAT IS

00:49:30.701 --> 00:49:34.004 region:rollup2
THAT RIGHT YEAH AND THE POINT

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.739 region:rollup2
HERE IS THE REASON FOR THEIR

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:37.741 region:rollup2
DOING IT WITH THE WATER BOARD IS

00:49:35.739 --> 00:49:38.242 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN.

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.678 region:rollup2
THE.

00:49:38.242 --> 00:49:43.214 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE IN TERMS OF BRINGING

00:49:40.678 --> 00:49:44.014 region:rollup2
A GROUP TOGETHER TO TALK ABOUT

00:49:43.214 --> 00:49:46.884 region:rollup2
WHAT THE VARIOUS.

00:49:44.014 --> 00:49:48.219 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES ARE AND YOU JUST

HEARD FROM MR GROWL.

00:49:48.219 --> 00:49:52.556 region:rollup2
HOW?

00:49:49.887 --> 00:49:53.924 region:rollup2
SOME STRATEGIES CAN MAKE IT

00:49:52.556 --> 00:49:54.725 region:rollup2
WORSE IN OTHERS.

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:57.094 region:rollup2
CAN BE PREVENTIVE

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:58.329 region:rollup2
AND.

00:49:57.094 --> 00:50:00.264 region:rollup2
IDEALLY.

00:49:58.329 --> 00:50:01.966 region:rollup2
IF THE WATER BOARD COULD COME

00:50:00.264 --> 00:50:03.934 region:rollup2
UP WITH SOME STANDARD.

00:50:01.966 --> 00:50:05.703 region:rollup2
PERMIT.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:07.371 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY

00:50:05.703 --> 00:50:09.506 region:rollup2
COULD ASK FOR THAT'S WHAT WE'D

00:50:07.371 --> 00:50:11.108 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SEE WHETHER I CAN DO IT

00:50:09.506 --> 00:50:12.776 region:rollup2
IN THIS BILL ARE NOT I DON'T

00:50:11.108 --> 00:50:13.344 region:rollup2
KNOW BUT AGAIN I PROMISE TO DO

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:15.112 region:rollup2
IT EITHER THIS YEAR AND NEXT

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.646 region:rollup2

WITH IRRIGATION INDUSTRY A

00:59:14.384 --> 00:59:18.455 region:rollup2
LANDSCAPE CONTRACTORS AND OTHERS

00:59:16.086 --> 00:59:20.524 region:rollup2
BECAUSE REALLY. THEN THE MAIN

00:59:18.455 --> 00:59:22.626 region:rollup2
SOURCE OF LANDSCAPE WASTE OUR

00:59:20.524 --> 00:59:23.794 region:rollup2
OUR IRRIGATION SYSTEM.

00:59:22.626 --> 00:59:25.295 region:rollup2
AND NOT WITHSTAND THE FACT THAT

00:59:23.794 --> 00:59:26.963 region:rollup2
WE'VE START TO INCORPORATE WE DO

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:27.731 region:rollup2
INCORPORATE MUCH MORE TRIPS

00:59:26.963 --> 00:59:30.133 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

00:59:27.731 --> 00:59:31.034 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. IT MEANS NOTHING IF

00:59:30.133 --> 00:59:32.235 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER AT THE END OF THE

00:59:31.034 --> 00:59:33.703 region:rollup2
DAY THE HOMEOWNER AT THE END OF

00:59:32.235 --> 00:59:34.838 region:rollup2
THE DAY THE PROPERTY OWNER

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:36.740 region:rollup2
CANDIDATE DOESN'T IT JUST THAT

00:59:34.838 --> 00:59:38.008 region:rollup2
IRRIGATION SYSTEM ACCORDINGLY

00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.077 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. TO MAKE A

00:59:38.008 --> 00:59:40.577 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IS THAT COME WITH THE

00:59:40.077 --> 00:59:42.813 region:rollup2
WEATHER AND THE CLIMATIC

00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:45.048 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES.

00:59:42.813 --> 00:59:46.316 region:rollup2
OUR CONCERN WITH THIS IS IS

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:48.552 region:rollup2
REALLY TWO FOLD AND IT'S NOT

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:49.186 region:rollup2
JUST ONE SPECIFIC AREA THE BILL

00:59:48.552 --> 00:59:49.419 region:rollup2
THAT DEALS WITH THE LABELING OF

00:59:49.186 --> 00:59:51.755 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

00:59:49.419 --> 00:59:53.090 region:rollup2
FIRST.

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:54.157 region:rollup2
WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'LL PROVIDE

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.692 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATION OR THE KNOWLEDGE

00:59:54.157 --> 00:59:57.227 region:rollup2
THE CONSUMER.

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:59.463 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL PROFESSOR SO IT

00:59:57.227 --> 01:00:02.466 region:rollup2
WILL FOR EXAMPLE.

00:59:59.463 --> 01:00:04.534 region:rollup2
IT'LL BE A NURSERY AYE IN TULARE

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:06.169 region:rollup2
COUNTY OR KINGS COUNTY OR MADERA

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:08.538 region:rollup2
COUNTY THAT'S ACTUALLY PRODUCING

01:00:06.169 --> 01:00:09.005 region:rollup2
THIS THESE PLANTS THAT WILL MOVE

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:09.873 region:rollup2
ALL OVER THE STATE OF

01:00:09.005 --> 01:00:11.575 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:14.111 region:rollup2
HERE NOW REQUIRING THAT NURSERY

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:15.445 region:rollup2
OWNER TO ACCOMMODATE AND PLAN

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.447 region:rollup2
FOR WHERE THOSE PLANTS WILL

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:19.015 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY END UP TO PROVIDE A

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.517 region:rollup2
LABEL THAT WILL BE SPECIFIC TO

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:22.752 region:rollup2
THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA THE

01:00:20.517 --> 01:00:25.522 region:rollup2
CLIMATIC AREA. FOR THAT PLANT

01:00:22.752 --> 01:00:28.458 region:rollup2
THE IT SAYS IT IN THE ANALYSIS

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:30.126 region:rollup2
THAT I'M A PLANT LIKE AN AZALEA.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.161 region:rollup2
MAY BE CONSIDERED A HIGH WATER

01:00:30.126 --> 01:00:32.963 region:rollup2
PLANT.

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.797 region:rollup2
BUT THAT COULD CHANGE DEPENDING

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:35.398 region:rollup2
ON THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA WHERE

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:37.267 region:rollup2
IT'S PLANTED.

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:39.402 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA. ONE OF THE

01:00:37.267 --> 01:00:40.770 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY WE DO HAVE A

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.239 region:rollup2
FLOURISHING NURSERY INDUSTRY.

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.839 region:rollup2
ARE ALL THE DIFFERENT CLIMATIC

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:44.441 region:rollup2
pAREAS THE GEOGRAPHICAL ZONES

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:46.576 region:rollup2
THE

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:47.911 region:rollup2
ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:49.412 region:rollup2
TO PLANT A LARGE VARIETY OF

01:00:47.911 --> 01:00:49.980 region:rollup2
PLANTS.

01:00:49.412 --> 01:00:51.181 region:rollup2
ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.249 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:53.950 region:rollup2
AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THAT

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:55.585 region:rollup2
PLANT IS GROWN. ITS WATER USE

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.988 region:rollup2
WILL CHANGE

01:00:55.585 --> 01:01:00.090 region:rollup2
SO. PLANTS ARE SOPHISTICATED

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:01.525 region:rollup2
BEANS AND THERE'S A LOT MORE

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.226 region:rollup2
THAT GOES INTO THE CARE AND

01:01:01.525 --> 01:01:05.061 region:rollup2
NURTURE OF A PLANT THAN SIMPLY A

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:06.596 region:rollup2
LABEL. AND WORK SO WERE AFRAID

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:08.765 region:rollup2
THAT JUST BY PUTTING A LABEL ON

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:10.133 region:rollup2
A PLANT WILL NOT GIVE

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.434 region:rollup2
THE TYPE A NOTICE THAT A

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.969 region:rollup2
CONSUMER WOULD REALLY NEED TO

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:14.171 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE BUYING DECISIONS.

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.672 region:rollup2
SECONDLY IT'S GONNA ADD

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:17.274 region:rollup2
INCREASED LABOR.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:19.809 region:rollup2
TO THE NURSERY INDUSTRY WHICH

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:21.511 region:rollup2
IS ALREADY STRUGGLING OF WITH.

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:23.513 region:rollup2
YOU NOTE THAT THE ECONOMY IS IS

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:25.315 region:rollup2
COMING BACK HAS BEEN SLOW ON THE

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:26.583 region:rollup2
SIDE OF THE ON THE NURSERY AND

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:28.318 region:rollup2
NOW WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING LABELS

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:29.519 region:rollup2
ICE LIKE I SAID EARLIER THOSE

01:01:28.318 --> 01:01:30.820 region:rollup2
LABELS NEED TO BE CONSISTENT

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.622 region:rollup2
WITH THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.256 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE GOING. AND WE JUST

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.524 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S POSSIBLE

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:36.226 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:37.427 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

01:01:36.226 --> 01:01:38.995 region:rollup2
TO HELP CONSERVE WATER IN THE

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:40.797 region:rollup2
STATE F CALIFORNIA WE JUST

01:01:38.995 --> 01:01:43.133 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT THIS IDEA OF

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:44.601 region:rollup2
PUTTING A. LABEL ON A PLANT WILL

01:01:43.133 --> 01:01:48.738 region:rollup2
HELP US GET THERE AND THEREFORE

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:52.142 region:rollup2
WE OPPOSED THE.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:53.710 region:rollup2
THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:55.712 region:rollup2
CNN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.279 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE OTHERS CURRENTLY NOT

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.047 region:rollup2
EMOTION IF ANY WOULD LIKE TO

01:01:56.279 --> 01:01:59.516 region:rollup2
MAKE ONE.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:01.251 region:rollup2
BOOK.

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:04.487 region:rollup2
IT'S MADE BY MISTER CHIU.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:35.919 region:rollup2
MY MY LARGEST CONCERN HERE IS.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:37.988 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

WATER AND STATE. OF SEVERAL

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:42.626 region:rollup2

WHICH IS DISTURBING IN ITSELF.

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:49.099 region:rollup2
.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:51.301 region:rollup2
WHY ARE WE LOOKING TO DO MORE

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:53.003 region:rollup2
PURPLE FIVE USE MORE RECYCLED

THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED ONE

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:57.374 region:rollup2
OTHER OPTIONS OTHER THAN

01:02:55.839 --> 01:02:58.541 region:rollup2
CREATING A BURDEN ON OTHER

01:02:57.374 --> 01:03:01.478 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIES.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:04.447 region:rollup2
IN MORE GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS A

01:03:01.478 --> 01:03:05.982 region:rollup2
PROBLEM THAT WE ALL KNOW IS.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.017 region:rollup2
BEING ADDRESSED IN OTHER WAYS SO

01:03:05.982 --> 01:03:08.151 region:rollup2
I MEAN YOU'RE NOT GONNA MY

WITH WATER BUT CREATING IN

01:03:18.862 --> 01:03:22.132 region:rollup2
SPENDING MONEY ON PROGRAMS THAT

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:24.134 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.001 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE OTHER PROGRAMS

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.603 region:rollup2

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:28.505 region:rollup2
WE WE'VE GOT A CONSERVE ALL OUR

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:30.940 region:rollup2
RESOURCES.

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:32.142 region:rollup2
NOT SURE IF YOU WERE SITTING

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:32.909 region:rollup2
DOWN AND I DIDN'T REALIZE

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.444 region:rollup2
WHETHER YOU'RE HERE WHEN I WAS

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:35.512 region:rollup2
SPEAKING BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY A

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.813 region:rollup2
CONTINUATION OF AN

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.281 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BILL THAT

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:39.182 region:rollup2
PASSED TWO YEARS AGO. IT'S

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:41.217 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MAKING THOSE

01:03:39.182 --> 01:03:42.585 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATIONS A REALITY YES

01:03:41.217 --> 01:03:43.853 region:rollup2
AND I I WAS HERE THE SORRY I DID

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:45.989 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME I DIDN'T SEE IN

01:03:43.853 --> 01:03:48.124 region:rollup2
HERE THE ENTIRE TIME SO THIS IS

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.959 region:rollup2
ALSO. AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:51.728 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:54.531 region:rollup2
THAT DON'T OFTEN WORK TOGETHER.

01:03:51.728 --> 01:03:55.732 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE COME TO THE TABLE TO

01:03:54.531 --> 01:03:58.168 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY.

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:59.002 region:rollup2
INCLUDING A COALITION OF PEOPLE

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.370 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENT

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:02.405 region:rollup2
VIEWPOINTS.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:04.140 region:rollup2
IN ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:06.476 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE A STATE.

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:08.111 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY PUTS THE LAWS THAT

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:10.647 region:rollup2
THEY PLAN IN PLACE.

01:04:08.111 --> 01:04:11.981 region:rollup2
AND THAT WE ARE CONSERVING WATER

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:14.984 region:rollup2
IN THE BEST WAYS THAT WE CAN SO

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:15.552 region:rollup2
PEOPLE CHECK OUT OTHER PARTS OF

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.653 region:rollup2
THE STATE OF THE IN THE NEW

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:17.954 region:rollup2
ISSUE ON DISTRICT.

01:04:16.653 --> 01:04:19.823 region:rollup2
I I WELCOME WORKING WITH YOU IN

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:24.527 region:rollup2
FIGURING THAT OUT SIR THANK YOU

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:27.163 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHOI.

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:30.633 region:rollup2
NOW MY QUESTION NOW IS THAT THE

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:33.036 region:rollup2
I HEAR THE REQUIREMENT IS SO

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:33.970 region:rollup2
LARGELY PLACED ON THE NURSERY

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.506 region:rollup2
ASIDE AND THEN.

01:04:33.970 --> 01:04:39.075 region:rollup2
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING I THINK

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:41.277 region:rollup2
IN THEIR SERIES.

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:42.912 region:rollup2
GENERALLY TONES START THE

01:04:41.277 --> 01:04:45.849 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AT THE RETAILER CELL

01:04:42.912 --> 01:04:48.985 region:rollup2
AND THE FARMER SO REGIONALLY

01:04:45.849 --> 01:04:50.754 region:rollup2
TAKE ROLL AND THE SOUTH

01:04:48.985 --> 01:04:52.555 region:rollup2
NURSERIES.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:54.124 region:rollup2
A I WONDER IF ARE THE ORIGIN ON

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.725 region:rollup2
A CULTIVATOR SO.

01:04:54.124 --> 01:04:57.527 region:rollup2
OF FROM THE SEED THAT THEY CUT

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:59.629 region:rollup2
TO PAY THE UNPAID THOUGH MORE

01:04:57.527 --> 01:05:01.664 region:rollup2
EXPORTS OF FOR THEM TO ORIGINATE

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:04.968 region:rollup2
TARA. THE LABEL ACCOUNTABLE

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:05.535 region:rollup2
WATER MAY BE. NECESSARY BECAUSE

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:09.205 region:rollup2
OF RECENTLY I BOUGHT A PLAN

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:12.909 region:rollup2
DAYS.

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
IN OUR OUR SELDOM CAN FOR A

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:20.517 region:rollup2
PLANT THE BELOW MY WATER.

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.852 region:rollup2
MY HOPE FOUNTAIN AND GO. WHERE

01:05:20.517 --> 01:05:24.554 region:rollup2
THEY MAY BE LACK OF US SON?

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:27.757 region:rollup2
SO OF US ARE LOOKING FOR.

01:05:24.554 --> 01:05:30.260 region:rollup2
W. CLIMATE THE SUN Y. SHAPE THE

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:33.730 region:rollup2
WHERE THE PLANT CAN PATROL.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:35.398 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEY OR NAY BUT THE BY

01:05:33.730 --> 01:05:38.635 region:rollup2
THE COLLAR AND A NIGHT IT WAS

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:41.571 region:rollup2
ABLE TO CHOOSE THAT THE PROP ONE

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:44.441 region:rollup2
UNTIL. AFTER TWO THREE MONTHS IS

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:46.509 region:rollup2
STILL SURVIVING SO.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.510 region:rollup2
I'M I MUST ABOUT THE HERE RIGHT

01:05:46.509 --> 01:05:50.613 region:rollup2
TIED INTO.

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:54.017 region:rollup2
SO AS SUCH THAT THE ORIGINAL.

01:05:50.613 --> 01:05:56.586 region:rollup2
IDEA COME FROM THE GERMINATION

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:57.454 region:rollup2
OF THE SEED COAT THE DEPARTMENT

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:59.189 region:rollup2
WOULD KNOW BETTER.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:00.590 region:rollup2
THE RATHER THAN PUTTING THAT

01:05:59.189 --> 01:06:02.625 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO THE BRIDGE

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:03.927 region:rollup2
RETAILER ESSA.

01:06:02.625 --> 01:06:04.727 region:rollup2
AND THEY MAY NOT KNOW YOU KNOW

01:06:03.927 --> 01:06:05.728 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO DO WITH THEIR OWN

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:06.830 region:rollup2
RESEARCH.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:07.430 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THAT THE

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:08.531 region:rollup2
HOW YOU CAN SOLVE THE KIND OF

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.699 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:09.966 region:rollup2
YES IF I MIGHT MISTER MISTER

01:06:09.699 --> 01:06:10.266 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN.

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:11.301 region:rollup2
.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:13.169 region:rollup2
THE THE BILL.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:14.404 region:rollup2
THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS IN

01:06:13.169 --> 01:06:15.472 region:rollup2
THE BILL.

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.340 region:rollup2
BUT LARGELY SUPPLEMENT

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:18.975 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.576 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW IN FACT MUCH THE

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.044 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RELATING

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:23.146 region:rollup2
TO.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:24.514 region:rollup2
TO LABELING ESERVER STATE IS A

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:26.783 region:rollup2
RESTATEMENT OF CURRENT LAW.

01:06:24.514 --> 01:06:29.152 region:rollup2
BUT LABELS ARE ALREADY REQUIRED

01:06:26.783 --> 01:06:29.886 region:rollup2
ON ON LANDSCAPE PLANTS IN

01:06:29.152 --> 01:06:31.354 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA UNDER MANY

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:32.889 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:36.392 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY.

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:38.695 region:rollup2
AFFECT OF THIS BILL IS TO ADD

01:06:36.392 --> 01:06:41.497 region:rollup2
THE WATER USE CLASSIFICATION.

01:06:38.695 --> 01:06:42.832 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PLANT.

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.601 region:rollup2
TWO THE LABELING REQUIREMENT

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:45.969 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALREADY THERE.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:48.171 region:rollup2
THAT'S PRIMARILY.

01:06:45.969 --> 01:06:49.506 region:rollup2
THE AFFECTED THE BILL SO THOSE

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:52.008 region:rollup2
WHO ARE LABELING NOW WOULD

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:54.444 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO LABEL WITH WITH.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.412 region:rollup2
ADDING THE WATER USE DESIGNATION

01:06:54.444 --> 01:06:57.380 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PLAN.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:58.848 region:rollup2
ADMITTEDLY THERE ARE SOME

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.250 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.385 region:rollup2
SOME SOME.

01:07:00.250 --> 01:07:04.187 region:rollup2
NUANCES ABOUT HOW A LABELING

01:07:02.385 --> 01:07:06.155 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT WOULD BE FASHION.

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:08.691 region:rollup2
THE BILL CALLS FOR FOOD NAG TO

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:10.126 region:rollup2
DO THIS THROUGH A RULE MAKING BY

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:11.761 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE IS TIME.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:12.795 region:rollup2
WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WOULD

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:15.465 region:rollup2
BE A STAKEHOLDER.

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:18.601 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK THAT FOOD NAG WOULD

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:20.737 region:rollup2
SET UP TO TO TAKE GUIDANCE FROM.

01:07:18.601 --> 01:07:22.171 region:rollup2
INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS ON HOW

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:25.308 region:rollup2
THE THE LABELING PROGRAM SHOULD

01:07:22.171 --> 01:07:26.910 region:rollup2
BE SET UP.

01:07:25.308 --> 01:07:29.045 region:rollup2
AND THAT AND I THINK YOU A

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:30.546 region:rollup2
TEACHER I WOULD HAVE MORE YEAH

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.481 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL QUESTION HIM.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.117 region:rollup2
IF I MAY ARE IS THAT.

01:07:31.481 --> 01:07:35.885 region:rollup2
UNLESS OUT THAT IS SO SPECIFIC

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:39.622 region:rollup2
IN THE WAR PLANT.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:41.457 region:rollup2
AND THE THE CONSUMER MAY PAY.

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:43.726 region:rollup2
A ATTENTION.

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:45.962 region:rollup2
AND THEN I I TEND TO OVER WATER

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:47.997 region:rollup2
AND A MY WIFE BUT TRUST ME TONE

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:50.300 region:rollup2
WATER UTILITY IN OFFICE SO SO

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:51.901 region:rollup2
IT'S AUTHORED THE COMMONSENSE SO

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:54.003 region:rollup2
WE WE LEARN AND A.

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:56.172 region:rollup2
BUT THE IF.

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:58.942 region:rollup2
A PLANTS I BY FOR OUTDOORS.

01:07:56.172 --> 01:08:01.311 region:rollup2
AND OF THAT OR DIFFERENT KINDS.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:03.746 region:rollup2
AND THE USUALLY WE WATER BASED

01:08:01.311 --> 01:08:05.214 region:rollup2
UPON THE SEASON SOMETIME.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:07.250 region:rollup2
IN A MORE FREQUENT THAT

01:08:05.214 --> 01:08:09.686 region:rollup2
WINTERTIME MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE A

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:12.055 region:rollup2
WEEK IN IN GENERAL.

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:14.023 region:rollup2
SO STE REQUIRING SPECIFIC

01:08:12.055 --> 01:08:16.025 region:rollup2
WATERMARK THE FULL OR DIFFERENT

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:18.761 region:rollup2
PLANS SO ON THE COTTON HOW THAT

01:08:16.025 --> 01:08:21.965 region:rollup2
WOULD REALLY HELP OTHER THAN.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:23.766 region:rollup2
IN ALL LABOR COSTA AND THEN IF

01:08:21.965 --> 01:08:25.601 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY THE CONSUMERS WILL

01:08:23.766 --> 01:08:27.470 region:rollup2
END UP PAYING MORE.

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:29.372 region:rollup2
NO SEWER I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:30.506 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE REALLY.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:32.609 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL AND.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:34.377 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIALLY SAVED THE WATER

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:36.846 region:rollup2
SO.

01:08:34.377 --> 01:08:38.581 region:rollup2
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:41.084 region:rollup2
DID THE MANDATED.

01:08:38.581 --> 01:08:42.652 region:rollup2
ACOSTA FOR THE NURSERIES TO TO

01:08:41.084 --> 01:08:44.420 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT KIND WHEN LABELS

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:46.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S MY CONCERN.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:48.491 region:rollup2
IF I MAY I WOULD JUST SAY THAT

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:49.926 region:rollup2
PART OF IT IS ALSO EDUCATE EIGHT

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:50.760 region:rollup2
EDUCATING THE CONSUMER SO IF

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:51.928 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA BUY.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.930 region:rollup2
.

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:55.064 region:rollup2
ROSES.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.865 region:rollup2
THEY REQUIRE A DIFFERENT TYPE OF

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:58.034 region:rollup2
WATER USE

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:58.901 region:rollup2
THEN A CACTUS.

01:08:58.034 --> 01:09:00.536 region:rollup2
AND YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY PUT

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:02.672 region:rollup2
THOSE TWO TOGETHER.

01:09:00.536 --> 01:09:03.840 region:rollup2
SO FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL GARDEN

01:09:02.672 --> 01:09:05.508 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.176 region:rollup2
AND HOW YOU PLACE IT AND SO IF

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:08.411 region:rollup2
YOU ARE BUYING PLANTS THAT

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.746 region:rollup2
ALREADY TELL YOU WHAT THE WATER

01:09:08.411 --> 01:09:11.147 region:rollup2
USES.

01:09:09.746 --> 01:09:13.716 region:rollup2
THEN YOU'RE GONNA DIVIDE YOUR

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:15.518 region:rollup2
GARDEN BASED ON THAT WATER USE.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:17.020 region:rollup2
AND YOUR NOT GONNA BE PUTTING.

01:09:15.518 --> 01:09:19.355 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY YOU WON'T BE PUTTING.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.123 region:rollup2
FLOWERS NEXT TO OTHER TYPES OF

01:09:19.355 --> 01:09:21.791 region:rollup2
PLANTS THAT ARE REQUIRED THE

01:09:20.123 --> 01:09:22.925 region:rollup2
SAME WATER USE.

01:09:21.791 --> 01:09:24.794 region:rollup2
AND THAT WAY YOU'RE ALSO SAVING

01:09:22.925 --> 01:09:26.195 region:rollup2
WATERING YOUR WATER BILL. IN

01:09:24.794 --> 01:09:27.296 region:rollup2
YOUR GARDEN CAN REFLECT

01:09:26.195 --> 01:09:32.235 region:rollup2
A DIVERSITY OF.

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:33.669 region:rollup2
OF NATURE.

01:09:32.235 --> 01:09:34.404 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER GLORIA THANK

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.972 region:rollup2
YOU SIR.

01:09:34.404 --> 01:09:37.407 region:rollup2
MYSTERY THANK YOU FOR THE

01:09:35.972 --> 01:09:39.275 region:rollup2
PRESENTATION I WAS.

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:40.710 region:rollup2
I'VE NAY APPRECIATE INVOLVEMENT

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:42.645 region:rollup2

MONEY GOING IN FIXING OTHER

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:18.674 region:rollup2
PEOPLE'S MISTAKES.

01:11:17.573 --> 01:11:19.942 region:rollup2
AND THE PERSON WHO ENDS UP

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:21.811 region:rollup2
REALLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF THAT

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:23.613 region:rollup2
ARE THE CONSUMERS.

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:25.148 region:rollup2
AND THE SAME WAY THAT CONSUMERS

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:25.615 region:rollup2
BEAR THE BRUNT OF THE FINANCIAL

01:11:25.148 --> 01:11:26.382 region:rollup2

THEY GO TO A NURSERY AND THEY

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:32.121 region:rollup2
UNKNOWINGLY BY SOMETHING THAT'S

01:11:29.418 --> 01:11:33.456 region:rollup2
VERY WATER THIRSTY AND THE PLANT

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:34.457 region:rollup2
DIES YOUR LEADER. SO THIS IS

01:11:33.456 --> 01:11:35.658 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WILL SAVE

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:37.393 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS MONEY.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:39.095 region:rollup2

TO KEEP OUR LANDSCAPESHEALTHY

01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:49.272 region:rollup2
WOULD EMIT DROUGHT CONDITIONS

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:50.540 region:rollup2
AND ALSO FOR HOMEOWNERS TO KNOW.

01:11:49.272 --> 01:11:52.108 region:rollup2

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:54.744 region:rollup2
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM?

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.012 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT DIFFICULT FOR

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:57.713 region:rollup2
NURSERIES TO PUT THIS

01:11:56.012 --> 01:11:59.148 region:rollup2

OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER USE

01:12:06.055 --> 01:12:08.624 region:rollup2
BUT A LOT OF NURSERIES DON'T DO

01:12:07.356 --> 01:12:10.593 region:rollup2
THAT. SO THIS IS A VERY THESE

01:12:08.624 --> 01:12:12.028 region:rollup2
ARE VERY COMMON SENSE MEASURES

01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:13.796 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED RECENTLY

01:12:12.028 --> 01:12:14.997 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY SHOULD BE ENSHRINED

OUGHT TO IS THAT I THINK THE

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:28.150 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IS THERE TO BE ABLE TO

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.651 region:rollup2
SAY THAT POSITIVE TRANSFORMATIVE

01:21:28.150 --> 01:21:31.687 region:rollup2
OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES ARE KEY.

01:21:29.651 --> 01:21:32.888 region:rollup2
OTHER ESSENTIAL FOR ALL CHILDREN

01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:34.490 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD ARGUE FOR

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.691 region:rollup2
ALL INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:37.292 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AS WELL.

01:21:35.691 --> 01:21:38.961 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF THE

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.829 region:rollup2
BEST PERIOD I MEAN TERMS OF

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:42.865 region:rollup2
STATE PARKS AND OTHER PUBLIC

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:44.333 region:rollup2
LANDS AND EVERYTHING FROM CITY

01:21:42.865 --> 01:21:46.034 region:rollup2
ALL THE WAY TO FEDERAL PUBLIC

01:21:44.333 --> 01:21:48.203 region:rollup2
LANDS WITHIN CALIFORNIA.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:50.339 region:rollup2
SO THE THREE POINTS IS THAT.

01:21:48.203 --> 01:21:51.673 region:rollup2
ONE OF THEM IS THIS QUESTION OF

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:53.142 region:rollup2
EQUITY AND INIQUITY GAPPING GOT

01:21:51.673 --> 01:21:55.244 region:rollup2
AN AN AXIS.

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:56.178 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT NEW.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.380 region:rollup2
BUT WE REALLY NEEDS REPORTS TO

01:21:56.178 --> 01:21:59.715 region:rollup2
GET TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.384 region:rollup2
BE ONE OF THE MOST.

01:21:59.715 --> 01:22:04.186 region:rollup2
EASY TO IDENTIFY SOMETIMES HARD

01:22:02.384 --> 01:22:06.121 region:rollup2
TO TACKLE A BARRIERS IN TERMS

01:22:04.186 --> 01:22:08.257 region:rollup2

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:09.124 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT TEND TO BE ONE

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:11.126 region:rollup2
OF THE BEST ASSETS AT A

01:22:09.124 --> 01:22:11.527 region:rollup2

HA.

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:14.863 region:rollup2
THE SECOND PIECE IS

01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:16.532 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY CAN

01:22:14.863 --> 01:22:18.801 region:rollup2

01:22:21.003 --> 01:22:22.938 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE SERVED BY COMMUNITY

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:27.042 region:rollup2
NONPROFITS THAT USUALLY DO NOT

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.277 region:rollup2

TRANSPORTATION PIECE WITH THE

01:22:35.317 --> 01:22:38.353 region:rollup2
FUNDING QUESTION CAN BE PRETTY

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:39.488 region:rollup2

WE MENTIONED EARLIER. ALREADY

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:07.035 region:rollup2
USE LOW EMISSION BUT.

01:25:04.967 --> 01:25:08.637 region:rollup2

REAL. OUR FIRST OPTION IS TO TRY

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:16.645 region:rollup2
TO USE THE LOW EMISSION BUSES

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.246 region:rollup2
OUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S

01:25:16.645 --> 01:25:18.780 region:rollup2
NOT ALWAYS GOING TO BE THE CASE

01:25:18.246 --> 01:25:20.716 region:rollup2
BUT IT SHOULD BE THE FIRST

01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:21.383 region:rollup2

AND I THINK FROM A POLICY

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.693 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE FOR LOOKING AT

01:26:36.258 --> 01:26:38.460 region:rollup2
POLICY THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUNG

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:40.262 region:rollup2

GETS TO A A BUDGET COMMITTEE.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:45.467 region:rollup2
THAT WE COULD BEGIN TO ADDRESS

01:26:44.399 --> 01:26:48.003 region:rollup2
MORE OF THE SERIOUS COSTS

BUDGET HE'S MADE A LOT OF MONEY

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:02.871 region:rollup2

THE USE OF DOGS.

01:59:58.091 --> 02:00:00.527 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS BY ANY

MEANS.

02:00:00.527 --> 02:00:03.596 region:rollup2

THAT WATER METERS THAT ARE SOLD

02:21:55.140 --> 02:21:58.610 region:rollup2

02:21:57.042 --> 02:22:00.645 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ACCURACY.

02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:02.381 region:rollup2
BUILT INTO THEM AS WELL IS TO

FRIEDMAN FOR HER INTEREST AND

02:22:14.359 --> 02:22:17.329 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THIS

02:22:15.994 --> 02:22:19.131 region:rollup2
WOULD DEAL WITH TWO ASPECTS OF

02:22:17.329 --> 02:22:19.664 region:rollup2
WATER METERS THERE SOMEWHAT

02:22:19.131 --> 02:22:20.999 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT BUT THEY'RE BOTH

02:22:19.664 --> 02:22:23.034 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANT. PART OF IT IS

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:24.603 region:rollup2
THE ACCURACY OF METERS WHEN

02:22:23.034 --> 02:22:25.937 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NEW. AND THE BILL WOULD

02:22:24.603 --> 02:22:28.273 region:rollup2
DIRECT THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO

02:22:25.937 --> 02:22:29.975 region:rollup2
SET STANDARDS FOR THE ACCURACY

02:22:28.273 --> 02:22:31.810 region:rollup2
OF NEWLY PURCHASED METERS.

02:22:29.975 --> 02:22:33.478 region:rollup2
THE OTHER ASPECT IS THE ACCURACY

02:22:31.810 --> 02:22:35.280 region:rollup2
OF METERS THAT ARE INSTALLED IN

02:22:33.478 --> 02:22:36.148 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY IN SERVICE.

02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:37.849 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY

02:22:36.148 --> 02:22:40.352 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BECAUSE NOW ALL URBAN

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:42.421 region:rollup2
WATER SUPPLIERS ARE REQUIRED TO.

02:22:40.352 --> 02:22:43.889 region:rollup2
A PREPARE AND SUBMIT TO THE

02:22:42.421 --> 02:22:45.490 region:rollup2
STATE A WATER LOSS AUDIT ON AN

02:22:43.889 --> 02:22:47.859 region:rollup2
ANNUAL BASIS.

02:22:45.490 --> 02:22:50.562 region:rollup2
AND HAVING AND ASSESSMENT OF THE

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:52.230 region:rollup2
DEGREE OF ACCURACY OR INACCURACY

02:22:50.562 --> 02:22:54.232 region:rollup2
OF THE METERS UTTERANCE SERVICE.

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.734 region:rollup2
IS REALLY ESSENTIAL PART OF

02:22:54.232 --> 02:22:57.335 region:rollup2
GETTING A GOOD ESTIMATE OF WATER

02:22:55.734 --> 02:22:58.370 region:rollup2
LOSSES FROM SYSTEM.

02:22:57.335 --> 02:22:59.638 region:rollup2
SO THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE

02:22:58.370 --> 02:23:01.973 region:rollup2
THE BILL IT WOULD DIRECT THE

02:22:59.638 --> 02:23:04.376 region:rollup2
STATE BOARD TO SET A CRITERIA

02:23:01.973 --> 02:23:05.110 region:rollup2
