00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.263

THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:02.613
KIND OF WISH WE COULD CALL IT.

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.186

00:43:12.022 --> 00:43:12.589
CARRYING IT OVER THE FINISH LINE

00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:13.791

THANK YOU CENTER STONE SENATOR

00:43:19.563 --> 00:43:21.365
MEASURE.

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.900
AND ONE OF KNOWLEDGE AS SO MANY

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:25.869
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE THIS SOLDIER.

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:29.373
OF JUSTICE FOR SO MANY YEARS.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.242
FINALLY MAKING GOOD ON A PROMISE

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.445
TO SO MANY PEOPLE SUFFERING --

00:43:34.511 --> 00:43:35.746
AND IT'S NOT JUST A CENTRAL

00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.581
VALLEY ISSUE.

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:38.615
BUT THEY'RE HURTING THEIR

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.351
IMPORTER BILL LIKE TO HURT IN

00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.685
SOUTH LOS ANGELES LIKE THEIR

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:43.220
HURT IN THE NORTH SALINAS VALLEY

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:45.155
IT'S IT'S TRUE ALL OVER THE

00:43:45.222 --> 00:43:46.090
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:43:46.156 --> 00:43:47.558
AND RARELY DOES ENVIRONMENTAL

00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:49.994
POLICY FOR MANY OF US GET SO

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:51.628
GROUNDED IN IN LIFE.

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:52.763
BUT I DID WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.533
ALSO BY SENATOR -- MY COLLEAGUE --

00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:58.168
ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SOME

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:00.571
OF THE CONCERNS RAISED YOU KNOW

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:02.139
I CONSIDER THIS VOTE TODAY.

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:03.040
BOTH.

00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.842
A MEASURE SUPPORT FOR CLEAN

00:44:04.908 --> 00:44:06.443
WATER IN CALIFORNIA BUT IT ALSO

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.745
HAS TO BE EMBEDDED IN IT A

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:09.013
PROMISE.

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:11.849
BECAUSE THE FUNDS THAT WERE CUT.

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:12.916
TO MAKE ROOM FOR THIS CLEAN

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.451
WATER PRIORITY WHICH I

00:44:14.518 --> 00:44:16.920
COMPLETELY AGREE HAS TO BE A TOP

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:17.454
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE OF

00:44:17.521 --> 00:44:18.989
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:19.056 --> 00:44:20.057
BUT THE FACT THAT WILD FIRE

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:21.725
RESILIENCE FUNDS WERE CUT TO

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.293
MAKE ROOM.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.862
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.830
FUNDING FOR RESILIENCE.

00:44:26.897 --> 00:44:27.898
IS SIMPLY A CHOICE THAT WE

00:44:27.965 --> 00:44:29.633
SHOULDN'T BE MAKING.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:30.634
THE CARBON PRICE RIGHT NOW IN

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.202
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.371
FIFTEEN DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS.

00:44:34.438 --> 00:44:35.539
THE SOCIAL COST OF CARBON

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:36.673
DEVELOP BY THE OBAMA

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.308
ADMINISTRATION BASED ON THE BEST

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:39.777
AVAILABLE SCIENCE.

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.512
IN THE WORLD PEER REVIEWED

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:42.846
RESEARCH SAID IT'S ABOUT THIRTY

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:45.082
FIVE DOLLARS A TON.

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:47.084
SO WHY IS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:47.751
PAYING HALF OF WHAT THEY SHOULD

00:44:47.818 --> 00:44:49.253
BE. TO THE CARBON PRICING

00:44:49.319 --> 00:44:50.654
CALIFORNIA.

00:44:50.721 --> 00:44:51.955
I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE FACED

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:53.657
WITH THIS CHOICE OF DECIDING

00:44:53.724 --> 00:44:55.059
BETWEEN CLEAN CLEAN AIR AND

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.627
CLEAN WATER IF THEY ACTUALLY

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.195
REFLECT.

00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.663
THE SYSTEM ACTUALLY REFLECT AN

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.231
ACCURATE CARBON PRICE.

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.299
SO I THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE

00:45:02.366 --> 00:45:04.501
DONE AND AT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:45:04.568 --> 00:45:06.203
AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.372
MAKE OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM.

00:45:08.439 --> 00:45:10.274
HONEST AND STRAIGHTFORWARD ABOUT

00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:11.775
CARBON PRICING.

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:12.776
AND THEN WE CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

00:45:12.843 --> 00:45:14.344
SOME BIGGER DECISIONS HERE

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:15.479
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY

00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:16.747
DO BOTH IN THE STATE.

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:18.482
I THINK WE CAN SOLVE WILD FIRES

00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:19.883
IN CLEAN AIR AND WE CAN SOLVE

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.951
CLEAN DINKING WATER.

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.820
SO I HOPE WITH THIS AYE VOTE

00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:23.854
TODAY.

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:25.656
HOW WE ALL COMMIT OURSELVES TO

00:45:25.722 --> 00:45:27.558
FILLING THAT FULL PROMISE -- TO

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:29.827

IN A CALMER MANNER.

01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.991
BUT THE DEPUTY SHERIFF COULD

01:07:09.058 --> 01:07:10.626
HAVE WITH HELLFIRE.

01:07:10.693 --> 01:07:15.197

01:07:35.584 --> 01:07:36.952
OR TO MEET THEM IN COURT.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.155
THE COUNTY WOULD SETTLE FOR FOUR

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:42.057

PREVENTABLE BUT THE DEPUTY HAD

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.535
ACTED REASONABLY AND HAD DONE

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:53.702
NOTHING TO WARRANT CRIMINAL

BE USED WHEN NECESSARY.

01:08:08.517 --> 01:08:10.986
THEY ARE DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES

01:08:11.053 --> 01:08:12.388
THEY DISTURB THE COMMUNITY.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:16.392

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.766
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

01:09:30.833 --> 01:09:33.636

IT.

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:51.153

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.023
IMPORTANT FACTORS IN THESE VERY

01:09:54.089 --> 01:09:57.793
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.492
THE TOTALITY OF THAT EXPERIENCE

01:10:30.559 --> 01:10:31.961
MEANING FROM WHEN THEY GOT THE

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:49.111
THE SCENE OF AN INCIDENT.

01:10:49.178 --> 01:10:51.447
THEY TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:53.515
AND THEY ALREADY ARE THOROUGHLY

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:56.018
TRAINED.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.821

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:18.340
CRIME MAY HAVE BEEN EVEN A

01:11:18.407 --> 01:11:20.743
RESIDENTIAL BURGLARY.

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:23.612
THEY PAY A PRICE.

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.647
TO THEY HAVE A SENSE THAT THEY

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.415
HAVE TO SERVE [inaudible]

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:28.651
FEAR.

01:11:28.717 --> 01:11:31.053
BUT THIS DOES PROVIDE FOR THE

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.988
TOTALITY OF THAT CIRCUMSTANCE TO

01:11:33.055 --> 01:11:35.024
BE CONSIDERED.

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.992
BY THAT OFFICER [inaudible] TO

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:38.994
BE.

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.196

01:11:41.263 --> 01:11:43.632
AS A ALREADY DO.

01:11:43.699 --> 01:11:46.135
BUT THESE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS THE

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:49.304
RESULT IN COCKADED INTO THE BILL.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:50.739
DO MAKE IT I THINK.

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.241
A STEP.

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.410
IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. TO

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:56.078
ALLEVIATE CONCERNS OF MANY OF

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:59.615
THOSE WHO FEEL VERY STRONGLY.

01:11:59.682 --> 01:12:01.150
AGAINST THE NUMBERS OF

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:02.918
INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:03.852
KILLED.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.754
IN ONE FORCED MINISTERS AND THEY

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.856
ALSO ARE ACCOMMODATING TO THOSE

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.591

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.293
WHO ARE STRONG SUPPORTERS?

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:15.230

I RESERVE MY OPPORTUNITIES TO BE

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:22.504
VIGILANT IN THE FUTURE.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:23.739
IF THERE ARE ANY ATTEMPTS TO

01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:25.407
CHANGE.

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:28.043
THE VERBIAGE IN THIS LEGISLATION.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.178

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:30.913
LANGUAGE.

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:32.948
THAT WOULD BE SO ONEROUS.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.850
WE MUST NOT PUT [inaudible]

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.885
THE HANDCUFFS.

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:37.619

SUPPORT OF AB.

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:06.849
THREE NINE TWO A MEASURE WHOSE

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.016
TIME IS LONG.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:10.285
OVERDUE AND IT'S CALM.

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:11.854
IN MANY WAYS TO SPREAD THE MOST

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.722
IMPORTANT MEASURE I WILL VOTE ON

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:15.691
AS THE LEGISLATURE.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:17.426
BUT SINCE MANY OF YOU'VE NEVER

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:19.428
SPENT A DAY IN MY FAIR GOBBLES

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:20.229
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:21.096
BE BLACK.

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:22.898
AND FACE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.133
COUNTRY.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:25.467
THERE'S BEEN MUCH DEBATE.

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.570
ABOUT THIS ISSUE [inaudible]

01:13:28.637 --> 01:13:29.972
WELL NEEDED.

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.507
THIS MEASURE STARTED OUT AS A

01:13:31.573 --> 01:13:33.675
POLICE REFORM BILL.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.310

AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.682
BECAUSE I'VE COME TO THE REALITY

01:13:40.749 --> 01:13:42.050
IT'S NOT ART POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.519

HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN IT COMES

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:47.256
TO RACE IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:13:47.322 --> 01:13:48.791
BECAUSE THIS COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:52.594
ON RACISM IT WAS FOUNDED ON THE

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:53.896
SLAVERY OF BLACK PEOPLE.

01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:56.064

INDIVIDUAL WAS WHITE.

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.340
BUT JUST TWO WEEKS AGO.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.175
A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN IN MY

01:14:40.242 --> 01:14:42.477
DISTRICT WHO WAS SIMPLY BACKING

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:45.013

AMERICA'S FOLKS.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.532
ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.438
THE RACE ISSUE.

MYERS FLORIDA.

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:15.077
WE HEARD ABOUT THE MAYOR --

01:15:25.487 --> 01:15:27.489
NOT ONE SHOT WAS FIRED AT THIS

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:28.924

01:15:30.425 --> 01:15:31.994
INDIVIDUAL WAS QUITE.

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:33.695
THEY DO NOT FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES

01:15:33.762 --> 01:15:35.430
WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER WHITE MEN

01:15:35.497 --> 01:15:37.165
WITH GUNS BUT THEY FEAR FOR

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:38.367
THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:40.736
AFRICAN AMERICAN WITH NO MORE.

01:15:40.802 --> 01:15:42.638
THAN A CELL PHONE RUNNING.

01:15:42.704 --> 01:15:45.440
FROM POLICE SO MEMBERS WE NEED

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.075
TO REFORM OUR HEARTS.

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.176
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:15:48.243 --> 01:15:49.011
HISTORY.

01:15:49.077 --> 01:15:51.713
OF USE OF DEADLY FORCE WHICH WAS

01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:54.650
INTRODUCED IN.

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:55.250
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THERE WAS

EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO BLACK FOLKS

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.359
WERE FREE AND THAT WAS ANOTHER

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:08.063
TOOL. TO EXECUTE AND KILL BLACK

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.265
FOLKS SO I'M DEEPLY SADDENED

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:12.000
WHEN LAST WEEK.

01:16:12.067 --> 01:16:13.568
AND HIRE A AT TWO OF OUR

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:16.004
COLLEAGUES VOTED TO AGAINST

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.106
ETHNIC STUDIES BECAUSE OF WE HAD

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.808
ETHNIC STUDIES HERE IN

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.576
CALIFORNIA AND ARE UNIVERSITIES

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.211
WOULD PROBABLY TELL THE STORY OF

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.580
RACE A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT WE

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:26.515
DO TODAY.

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.850
ANOTHER EXAMPLE AGAIN I WANT TO

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.653
MAKE THE COMPARISON OF RACE. TWO

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.990
YEARS AGO IN MINNESOTA.

01:16:35.057 --> 01:16:37.025
A OFFICER SHOT ON ON ARMED.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:39.795
WHITE WOMAN.

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:42.197
HE STATED HE FEARED FOR HIS LIFE.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:43.465
THE CHIEF QUICKLY ONE ON PUBLIC

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:45.367
TV.

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.836
EVERY TO KILL THE OFFICER FOR A

01:16:47.903 --> 01:16:49.371
SHOOTING OUT OF POLICY THAT

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.807
OFFICER WAS QUICKLY FIRED.

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:54.443
AND SURELY THERE AFTER HE WAS

01:16:54.509 --> 01:16:54.676
CHARGED.

01:16:54.743 --> 01:16:57.012
WITH MURDER. TWO MONTHS AGO HE

01:16:57.079 --> 01:16:58.547
WAS CONVICTED OF MURDER WAS

01:16:58.613 --> 01:17:01.249
BECAUSE THE VICTIM WAS WHITE AND

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:01.917
UNARMED.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.453
WAS IT BECAUSE THE OFFICER WAS

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.321
BLACK AND HE WAS MUZZLE.

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.357
THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD HERE.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.359
AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT WHEN

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:12.060
IT COMES TO OUR OUR LONG PORTS

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:12.761
BUT I DON'T HOLD OUR LAW

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:13.395
ENFORCEMENT.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.564
RESPONSIBLE BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:17.065
ROOTED IN RACE DR MARTIN LUTHER

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.867
KING SAID THE NEGRO IN AMERICA

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:19.801
GETS.

01:17:19.868 --> 01:17:22.104
TWICE AS MUCH AS WHAT IS BAD IN

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:23.905
ONLY HALF OF WHAT IS GOOD IN

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:25.073
AMERICA THAT.

01:17:25.140 --> 01:17:26.608
DEALS WITH OUR COURT SYSTEM OUR

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:29.077
EDUCATION SYSTEM ON HOUSING.

01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.880
R. I. N. YES OUR POLICE

01:17:31.947 --> 01:17:33.248
DEPARTMENTS.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.384
HE'S STILL EXIST TODAY.

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.485
DR KING ALSO STATED WE CAN NEVER

01:17:36.551 --> 01:17:38.420
BE SATISFIED AS LONG AS THE

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.023
NEGRO IS THE VICTIM UNSPEAKABLE

01:17:41.089 --> 01:17:43.458
HORRORS OF POLICE BRUTALITY.

01:17:43.525 --> 01:17:45.394
THAT WAS IN NINETEEN SIXTY THREE

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.496
IS STILL APPLIES TODAY.

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:49.965
IT STILL APPLIES TODAY.

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:52.000
SO COLLEAGUES.

01:17:52.067 --> 01:17:53.702
I WANTED TO REFLECT.

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.870
ON WHERE WE ARE AND WHY WE'RE

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.405
HERE TODAY.

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:57.773
AGAIN IT WAS NOTHING HAPPENING

01:17:57.839 --> 01:18:00.308
IN AMERICA IN.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:00.842
EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THAT

01:18:00.909 --> 01:18:02.644
WARRANTED THE USE OF DEADLY

01:18:02.711 --> 01:18:04.279
FORCE OTHER THAN THERE ARE

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.547
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME.

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:08.283
WHO WERE FREE?

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.586
AND I CHALLENGES.

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:12.854
TO REALLY LOOK AT THIS ISSUE OF

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.823
RACE.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.525
FAR BEYOND AGAIN OUR LAW

FOLKS THAT DON'T LOOK LIKE MAY.

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:39.708
IT'S A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.943
PEOPLE OFTEN ASK WHY DO AFRICAN

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.103
STANDARD WHEN IT COMES TO AGAIN

THEIR INTERACTION.

01:20:27.556 --> 01:20:29.424
WHAT POLICE IN WAS FAR DIFFERENT

01:20:29.491 --> 01:20:30.625
IN THE CONVERSATION WE HAD IN MY

TALKING ABOUT AMERICANS.

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:02.610
DUE TO THE LONG SEATED.

01:23:02.677 --> 01:23:05.714
AND SYSTEMIC RACISM.

01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:08.850

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:15.123
THAT THE LAWS WERE BASED ON THAT

01:23:15.190 --> 01:23:16.224
OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM WAS BASED

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:20.228
ON JUST EVERY SINGLE INSTITUTION

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:23.398
IN OUR COUNTRY AND I STATE THIS.

01:23:23.465 --> 01:23:25.567
NOT TO SAY THAT I AM NOT A PROUD

01:23:25.633 --> 01:23:27.035

01:23:36.277 --> 01:23:39.681
THAT THOSE WORDS.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.883
WERE NOT DESIGNED TO PROTECT

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:44.085
EVERYONE AND THAT OVER TIME

01:23:44.152 --> 01:23:46.287
WE'VE UNDERSTOOD THAT.

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:48.289

VIOLENCE.

01:24:26.995 --> 01:24:28.363
ANY NUMBER OF OTHER THINGS.

COLORS.

01:24:56.324 --> 01:24:58.626
IS WAY HIGH SOFT THE CHARTS

01:24:58.693 --> 01:24:58.927
[inaudible]

01:24:58.993 --> 01:25:00.862
SO.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.731
BECAUSE OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS.

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:06.234
THE RESULTS IN MANY MANY BAD

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:08.169
CONSEQUENCES.

01:25:08.236 --> 01:25:09.804
BUT THE WORST.

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:12.707
IS THE PROVEN INCREASED

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:15.844
POTENTIAL FOR A BLACK PERSON TO

01:25:15.910 --> 01:25:17.846

ENFORCEMENT FOR THAT THOUGH

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:24.385
CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME LAW

ENFORCEMENT INDIVIDUALS WHO

01:25:26.387 --> 01:25:28.323
REALLY ARE NOT GOOD APPLES.

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:34.529
BUT THESE BIASES ARE SO DEEP.

01:25:34.596 --> 01:25:37.031
THEY CAN ONLY BE CORRECTED IF WE

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.167
ARE INTENTIONAL.

01:25:39.234 --> 01:25:40.668
IF WE RECOGNIZE IT AND IF WE ACT

01:25:40.735 --> 01:25:42.770
WITH PURPOSE.

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.272
AND THIS BILL.

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:47.208
IS AN ACT WITH PURPOSE.

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.978
IT IS IN FACT THAT BY RAISING

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.513
THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD.

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:53.748
IT WILL LESSEN.

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.283
THE DANGER AND RISK.

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:57.385
THAT A BLACK PERSON WILL DIE AT

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:58.920
THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.856
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY OUR

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.625
RESPONSIBILITY.

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.560
TO TO ABSOLUTELY.

01:26:05.627 --> 01:26:07.028
NOW WILL IT A TOTALLY ELIMINATE

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:09.097
NO.

01:26:09.163 --> 01:26:11.566
AND WE MAY FIND OVER TIME.

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:14.402
WE HAVE TO GO A LOT FARTHER.

01:26:14.469 --> 01:26:15.703
BUT IT DOES STRIKE A VERY

01:26:15.770 --> 01:26:17.539
IMPORTANT BALANCE AND WITH THE

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:19.774
POST TRAINING AND WE HEARD FROM

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:22.477
SECTION ELOQUENT RESEARCHER.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:25.313
IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:27.749
COMMITTEE RECENTLY AND I AM

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:29.651
FEELING VERY EMBARRASSED THAT I

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.052
CANNOT REMEMBER HER NAME.

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:34.923
BUT SHE'S DONE RESEARCH ON HOW

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:37.292
WE CAN TRAIN [inaudible] TO

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:40.028
BASICALLY.

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:42.397
BECAUSE THAT THAT JUST CHANGING

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:43.598
THE USE OF FORCE STANDARD ALONE

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:45.133
WILL NOT DO IT.

01:26:45.199 --> 01:26:46.935
AND THAT ONLY CERTAIN KINDS OF

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:49.871
TRAINING WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.739
OUR BIAS.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:52.974
AND THERE'S GOOD RESEARCH THAT

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.742
SHOWS THE KIND OF TRAINING THAT

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:56.177
WILL.

01:26:56.244 --> 01:26:58.546
THAT WILL THEN.

01:26:58.613 --> 01:26:59.447
NOT ONLY.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.883
PROTECT.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.052
THAT BLACK PERSON FROM THAT RISK

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:05.687
AT THE HANDS OF THE OFFICER BUT

01:27:05.753 --> 01:27:07.855
PROTECT OUR OFFICERS.

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:10.625
SO TO ME THIS BILL IT'S SO

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:12.527
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DOES THE

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.495
APPROPRIATE BALANCING.

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:16.164
IT RECOGNIZES.

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:17.732
THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:27:17.799 --> 01:27:20.401
OFFICERS THEMSELVES EVERY TIME

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.570
THE DONNED THEIR UNIFORMS.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.539
AND WALK OUT THEIR DOOR.

01:27:24.606 --> 01:27:27.775
THEIR LIVES ARE AT RISK.

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.410
AND NONE OF US WANT TO INCREASE

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:32.213
THE RISK. TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.015
OFFICERS.

01:27:34.082 --> 01:27:36.684
AND THE WORK DONE BY THE AUTHOR.

01:27:36.751 --> 01:27:39.020
FIRE PRO TEM IN HER STAFF.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.189
BY OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY

01:27:41.255 --> 01:27:42.757
FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SIT

01:27:42.824 --> 01:27:45.393
DOWN AND WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:45.693
[inaudible]

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.495
THAT WORK.

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:49.797
AND OTHERS WERE INVOLVED IN A

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:52.467
TWO RESULTED IN A BILL.

01:27:52.533 --> 01:27:55.336
THAT APPROPRIATELY PROTECTS.

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:57.772
LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT MOST

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.407
IMPORTANTLY CORRECTS.

01:27:59.474 --> 01:28:01.009
CALIFORNIA'S USE OF FORCE

01:28:01.075 --> 01:28:04.045
STANDARD. TO PROTECT EACH AND

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.480
EVERYONE OF US.

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:08.149
BUT ESPECIALLY THOSE RESIDENTS

01:28:08.216 --> 01:28:10.485
WHO ARE MOST AT RISK OF LOSING

01:28:10.551 --> 01:28:13.187
THEIR LIVES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT.

01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:15.657
WHICH IS OUR BLACK RESIDENTS.

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:18.526
AND THAT IS ABSOLUTELY.

01:28:18.593 --> 01:28:19.994
AS I SAID SOMETHING.

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:22.597
IT IS ON US TO CORRECT.

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.766
AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE PART OF

01:28:24.832 --> 01:28:26.034
THAT CORRECTION.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:28.036
AND I'M ALSO VERY PROUD THAT THE

01:28:28.102 --> 01:28:29.070
TRAINING IS PART OF IT.

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.071
IN [inaudible]

01:28:30.138 --> 01:28:32.507
AND I'M.

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:34.575
FIND WE WILL BE MONITORING TO

01:28:34.642 --> 01:28:36.511
MAKE SURE THAT THE TRAINING

01:28:36.577 --> 01:28:39.247
INCLUDES THAT BIAS TRAINING THAT

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:40.615
IS SO ESSENTIAL BECAUSE

01:28:40.682 --> 01:28:42.150
OTHERWISE.

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.718
WHEN WE STAND HERE AND VOTE FOR

01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:45.253
THIS BILL?

01:28:45.319 --> 01:28:47.855
WE WANT IT TO WORK WE DO NOT

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:50.625
WANT THIS JUST TO BE SYMBOLIC WE

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:53.528
ACTUALLY WANT.

01:28:53.594 --> 01:28:54.729
TO CHANGE THAT BY S.

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:55.029
[inaudible]

01:28:55.096 --> 01:28:58.232
AND THUS.

01:28:58.299 --> 01:29:01.669
REDUCE THE DEATH BECAUSE IT IS

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.304
NOT APPROPRIATE AND I WOULD

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:06.774
FINALLY SAY [inaudible]

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.843
SOME.

01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:11.079
PEOPLE WERE JOKING.

01:29:11.145 --> 01:29:13.848
WHEN AROUND ME WHEN [inaudible]

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:16.551
THE AND I'M NOT TRYING TO

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:20.121
CRITICIZE THEM BUT WHEN THE

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.057
RAPPER WHO IS IN HIS MERCEDES.

01:29:23.124 --> 01:29:26.127
AT THE FAST FOOD STOP IN VALLEJO

01:29:26.194 --> 01:29:28.162
ANY FELL ASLEEP.

01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:30.231
HE FELL ASLEEP.

01:29:30.298 --> 01:29:31.933
HE HAD I DON'T KNOW IF THE GUN

01:29:31.999 --> 01:29:33.301
WAS IN HIS LAP I DON'T THINK WE

01:29:33.367 --> 01:29:35.403
HAVE THE ACTUAL RECORDS BUT THE

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:37.071
INFORMATION THAT WAS PORTRAYED

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:39.340
WAS THAT HE DID [inaudible]

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:43.344
AND THE FAST FOOD WORKERS.

01:29:43.411 --> 01:29:45.880
CALLED THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:47.115
COULDN'T REVIVE FROM THERE THE

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.950
DOORS WERE LOCKED AND ALL BUT HE

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:50.284
WAS STATE TO SLEEP AND THEY

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:51.085
NEEDED HIM TO MOVE OUT OF THE

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:51.719
WAY.

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:53.087
SO THEY COULD GET THE NEXT

01:29:53.154 --> 01:29:55.256
CUSTOMERS THEY DIDN'T CALL THE

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.958
POLICE BECAUSE THEY WERE FEARFUL

01:29:57.024 --> 01:29:58.493
OF THEIR LIVES THEY WERE JUST

01:29:58.559 --> 01:29:59.494

01:30:02.764 --> 01:30:07.168
BUT WHEN THE POLICE CAME

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:07.468

01:30:07.535 --> 01:30:10.404
AND A KNOCKED ON HIS WINDOW AND

01:30:10.471 --> 01:30:11.372

LIFTED UP IT REYES SAID HE WAS

01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:23.651
DEAD BEFORE THAT.

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.286
BUT THE POINT OF BRINGING UP IS

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:28.589
THAT SOME FRIENDS MY JOKED THAT.

01:30:28.656 --> 01:30:30.324
IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO ME AND

WITH A GUN IN HER CAR IN VALLEJO

01:30:46.340 --> 01:30:47.909
THEY JUST THINK YOU WERE TRYING

01:30:47.975 --> 01:30:50.444
TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

01:31:36.490 --> 01:31:37.358
COME TOGETHER AS LEGISLATORS

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:41.429
THERE ARE ISSUES OUT THERE IN

01:31:41.495 --> 01:31:42.997
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY.

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.966
AND OUR OWN COMMUNITIES WITH A

BLACK HISPANIC WEBER.

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.170
THAT ISSUES NEED TO BE RAISED.

01:31:49.237 --> 01:31:50.538
AND IT STARTS WITH THE LAW

01:31:50.605 --> 01:31:52.139
ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY WHERE THEY

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:53.708
RECEIVE THE TRAINING.

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.243
AND THE GUIDANCE AND THE

TRAINING THAT WE ARE TALKING

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:07.321
ABOUT.

01:32:07.388 --> 01:32:08.289
THAT NEEDS TO BE AT THE MINUTE

01:32:08.356 --> 01:32:10.291
IMPLEMENTED IN OUR POLICE

01:32:10.358 --> 01:32:12.760
ACADEMIES WE HAVE TO MAKE OUR

01:32:12.827 --> 01:32:14.462
POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:16.130
STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOOKED LIKE

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:18.666
CALIFORNIA.

01:32:18.733 --> 01:32:19.700
LOOKED LIKE ALL OF US.

01:32:19.767 --> 01:32:21.502
IF WE CAN GO BACK IN HISTORY THE

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:23.271
HISPANIC COMMUNITY GO BACK IN

01:32:23.337 --> 01:32:24.772
HISTORY IN THE FORTIES WHEN THE

01:32:24.839 --> 01:32:26.974
JUKE SHOOTERS WERE BEATEN -- IN

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.843
THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES THAT

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:29.710
HAPPENED.

01:32:29.777 --> 01:32:31.178
WITH AND THAT WAS AGAINST THE

01:32:31.245 --> 01:32:33.080
MILITARY FOR GOD SAKES BUT

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:34.982
BECAUSE THE THE JEW TUTORS WERE

01:32:35.049 --> 01:32:36.517
ENJOYING THEIR MUSIC THEIR CARS

01:32:36.584 --> 01:32:38.719
AND THEY WANDERED OFF EAST LA IN.

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:40.554
AND INTO DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES

01:32:40.621 --> 01:32:42.623
THE MILITARY WERE WERE CALLED IN

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.958

01:32:44.025 --> 01:32:45.126
HAPPENED.

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:47.395
SO THERE'S HISTORY ON ON EVERY

01:32:47.461 --> 01:32:49.130
SIDE IF WE LOOK FOR IT.

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:52.667

EDUCATION WE'RE MAKING INROADS

01:33:15.256 --> 01:33:17.358
EVERYWHERE WE GO BECAUSE I THINK

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.094
WE ALL REALIZE NOW THAT WE ARE.

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:21.195

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:16.130
UNDER WHICH PEOPLE [inaudible]

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:17.831
LIVE.

01:37:17.898 --> 01:37:19.099
WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE THE

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:20.367
CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH LAW

01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:21.702

01:42:39.019 --> 01:42:40.087
OBVIOUSLY.

DOING NOTHING WAS NOT AN OPTION

01:43:44.418 --> 01:43:45.953

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:28.728
CURRENT.

01:49:28.795 --> 01:49:30.497
REASONABLE STANDARD OF USING

FORCE AND SPECIFICALLY DEADLY

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.601
FORCE SET FORTH IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:37.237
LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION DOES

01:49:37.304 --> 01:49:39.205
NOT PROTECT PEOPLE'S FUNDAMENTAL

01:49:39.272 --> 01:49:41.474
HUMAN RIGHTS.

01:49:41.541 --> 01:49:44.978
DAN FOR FAR TOO MANY.

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:47.180
THOSE INSTANCES DON'T APPEAR TO

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.683
BE JUST.

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:51.518

01:49:51.584 --> 01:49:53.687
BLIND.

01:49:53.753 --> 01:49:55.555
AND THAT'S WHY MANY LAW

01:49:55.622 --> 01:49:57.090
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.825
RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO HOLD

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:10.036
WHEN FEASIBLE.

01:50:10.103 --> 01:50:12.906
USING FORCE THAT IS PROPORTIONAL

01:50:12.973 --> 01:50:14.708
TO THE LAWN FORSMAN OBJECTIVE.

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.643

ALL HUMAN LIFE.

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:24.250
BY AUTHORIZING PEACE OFFICERS TO

01:50:24.317 --> 01:50:25.885
USE DEADLY FORCE ONLY WHEN

01:50:25.952 --> 01:50:27.854
NECESSARY TO DEFEND AGAINST AN

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.023
IMMINENT THREAT OF DEATH OR

01:50:30.090 --> 01:50:31.925
SERIOUS BODILY INJURY.

01:50:31.992 --> 01:50:33.460
AND CONSIDERING THE ACTIONS OF

01:50:33.526 --> 01:50:35.061

01:50:45.271 --> 01:50:47.640

01:50:49.476 --> 01:50:53.013
PROTECTING HUMAN RIGHTS.

01:50:53.079 --> 01:50:55.682
FAR TOO MANY DAYS HAVE GONE BY

01:50:55.749 --> 01:50:57.984
WITH FAR TOO MANY DEATHS BECAUSE

01:50:58.051 --> 01:50:59.719
OF THE INACTION OF THOSE WHO

01:50:59.786 --> 01:51:02.689

THING YOU CAN DO IS DO THE RIGHT

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.708

THE NEXT BEST THING YOU CAN DO.

02:24:12.610 --> 02:24:13.778
IS DO THE WRONG THING.

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:15.413
AND THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO

02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.881
IS DO NOTHING.

JUNCTURE THE COST OF DOING

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.562
NOTHING IS SIMPLY TOO HIGH.

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.531
DOING NOTHING LOOKS LIKE AT

02:24:33.598 --> 02:24:35.700

02:24:35.767 --> 02:24:37.001

02:24:56.254 --> 02:24:56.687
IS.

02:24:56.754 --> 02:24:58.356
EXTRAORDINARY WE HEARD THE

02:24:58.423 --> 02:24:59.690

ANYTHING THE RISK IS EVEN HIGHER.

02:25:25.883 --> 02:25:27.318

02:25:31.155 --> 02:25:33.024
THERE IS STILL WORK TO DO.

02:25:33.091 --> 02:25:33.958

OBVIOUSLY KEEP.

02:29:08.072 --> 02:29:12.109
THEM WHOLE SO WE CAN MANAGE --

02:29:12.176 --> 02:29:13.344
GETTING POWER TO OUR COULD CUT A

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:14.578
CONSUMERS.

02:29:14.645 --> 02:29:15.913
BUT THE BIGGEST THREAT WE HAVE

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:18.215
IS TOO MUCH VEGETATION.

02:29:18.282 --> 02:29:19.817
LAST YEAR WE DID SB NINE OH ON

02:29:19.884 --> 02:29:21.485
WORK VERY CLOSE WITH MY GOOD

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:22.920
COLLEAGUE FROM NAPA AND MANY

02:29:22.987 --> 02:29:24.588
OTHERS.

02:29:24.655 --> 02:29:26.757
BECAUSE WE HAD THE TUBS FIRE WE

02:29:26.824 --> 02:29:29.026
HAD THE BUTTE FIRE.

02:29:29.093 --> 02:29:30.227
WE HAD THE CAR FIRE WHICH WAS

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:31.262
BURNING AT THE TIME WE ARE

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:33.331
ACTUALLY DOING.

02:29:33.397 --> 02:29:38.703
THE BILL THAT NINE OH ONE BILL.

02:29:38.769 --> 02:29:40.071
AND THEN THIRTY DAYS AFTER WE

02:29:40.137 --> 02:29:41.706
GOT NINE A ONE PASSED WE HAD THE

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:43.974
CAMPFIRE THE LARGEST FIRE IN THE

02:29:44.041 --> 02:29:45.076
STATE OF CALIFORNIA MOST

02:29:45.142 --> 02:29:47.078
DEVASTATING FIRE.

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:48.979
BECAUSE A LEGISLATOR WE HAVE TO

02:29:49.046 --> 02:29:50.648
PLAY THE HAND WE'RE DEALT.

02:29:50.715 --> 02:29:52.450
IN UNFORTUNATELY THE HAND WE

02:29:52.516 --> 02:29:54.318
HAVE DEALT TO US TODAY IS THAT

02:29:54.385 --> 02:29:56.320
WE HAVE -- ONE UTILITY THE GENIE

02:29:56.387 --> 02:29:58.022
IN BANKRUPTCY.

02:29:58.089 --> 02:29:59.957
DUE TO CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE.

02:30:00.024 --> 02:30:01.959
WE HAVE TWO OTHER.

02:30:02.026 --> 02:30:03.427
I'LL USE THAT ARE ON THE VERGE

02:30:03.494 --> 02:30:05.262
OF BANKRUPTCY.

02:30:05.329 --> 02:30:06.731
SO WHAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO

02:30:06.797 --> 02:30:08.466
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS PASS

02:30:08.532 --> 02:30:09.700
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

02:30:09.767 --> 02:30:12.370
BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT THE RATE

02:30:12.436 --> 02:30:14.772
PAYERS WILL BE LEVELED OUT AS

02:30:14.839 --> 02:30:15.806
GOOD AS YOU CAN.

02:30:15.873 --> 02:30:17.708
IN A PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

02:30:17.775 --> 02:30:19.310
NUMBER TWO ALL THOSE VICTIMS WHO

02:30:19.377 --> 02:30:21.345
LOST THEIR HOMES.

02:30:21.412 --> 02:30:22.847
IN THE TUBS FIRE IN THE CAMP

02:30:22.913 --> 02:30:24.415
FIRE.

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:25.516
WHOTHEIR COMPANIES IN

02:30:25.583 --> 02:30:26.851
BANKRUPTCY RIGHT NOW HAVE A

02:30:26.917 --> 02:30:28.586
SECURE?

02:30:28.652 --> 02:30:32.456
WAY TO GO AFTER THOSE FUNDS.

02:30:32.523 --> 02:30:33.090
THAT THE THE COMPANIES ARE GOING

02:30:33.157 --> 02:30:35.192
TO PUT UP THE THE THE REVENUES

02:30:35.259 --> 02:30:36.927
TO OFFSET THE COST OF THEM.

02:30:36.994 --> 02:30:38.162
THINK ABOUT IT IF YOU'RE

02:30:38.229 --> 02:30:39.497
SOMEBODY WHO LOST HER HOME WHO

02:30:39.563 --> 02:30:42.533
IS UNDER SHIRT OR NOT INSURED.

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:44.135
BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY.

02:30:44.201 --> 02:30:45.202
YOU HAVE NO WHERE TO GO IF

02:30:45.269 --> 02:30:46.170
YOU'RE IN THE P. JEANNIE

02:30:46.237 --> 02:30:47.405
TERRITORY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE YOUR

02:30:47.471 --> 02:30:49.540
BANKRUPTCY.

02:30:49.607 --> 02:30:50.474
SO THIS A PERFECT BILL

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:52.576
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

02:30:52.643 --> 02:30:54.145
BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO

02:30:54.211 --> 02:30:56.080
I WOULD JUST VENTURE TO SAY MOST

02:30:56.147 --> 02:30:58.449
OF THE MEMBERS HERE KNOW THAT

02:30:58.516 --> 02:31:00.818
TOM THIS IS A PIECE OF THE PIE.

02:31:00.885 --> 02:31:02.620
WE'VE DONE ALL KINDS OF CAP AND

02:31:02.686 --> 02:31:04.455
TRADE BILLS WE'VE MOVED OUR PS

02:31:04.522 --> 02:31:06.123
STANDARD UP I VOTED AGAINST ALL

02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:07.558
THOSE BILLS.

02:31:07.625 --> 02:31:09.460
WE REGULATED THE COMMERCIAL

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:11.295
TRUCKS I OWN.

02:31:11.362 --> 02:31:13.097
THE LAWN MOWERS THE WE YEARS

02:31:13.164 --> 02:31:14.932
BECAUSE OF CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:31:14.999 --> 02:31:16.667
AS WE LET OUR POOREST.

02:31:16.734 --> 02:31:19.136
BURN IT'S WRONG WE NEED TO FOCUS

02:31:19.203 --> 02:31:21.338
ON THE BIGGEST EMITTER OF CARBON

02:31:21.405 --> 02:31:25.609
WHICH IS FORCE FIRE CALIFORNIA.

02:31:25.676 --> 02:31:27.244
SO I WANTED.

02:31:27.311 --> 02:31:28.646
COMMITTEE YOU I'M GONNA SUPPORT

02:31:28.712 --> 02:31:29.547
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I

02:31:29.613 --> 02:31:30.748
THINK THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR

02:31:30.815 --> 02:31:32.583
THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING.

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:34.518
I THINK WE HAVE. FOR ONE FIRE

02:31:34.585 --> 02:31:36.654
AWAY OR COUPLE FIRES AWAY FROM

02:31:36.720 --> 02:31:37.488
BEING RIGHT BACK HERE ON THIS

02:31:37.555 --> 02:31:39.623
FLOOR THIS THIS ISN'T A FIX ALL.

02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:41.258
THIS IS PART OF A LONG TERM

02:31:41.325 --> 02:31:42.593
PROCESS WE DIDN'T GET HERE

02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:44.662
OVERNIGHT IT IS A HUNDRED YEARS

02:31:44.728 --> 02:31:45.796
TO GET HERE.

02:31:45.863 --> 02:31:48.032
BUT IT'S OUR JOB TO DO THE RIGHT

02:31:48.098 --> 02:31:49.333
THING THE RIGHT THING IS TO VOTE

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:50.768
FOR THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION

02:31:50.835 --> 02:31:51.969
AND THEN LET'S GO BACK TO THE

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:52.536
DRAWING BOARD IN THE START

02:31:52.603 --> 02:31:55.239
LOOKING AT THAT VEGETATION.

02:31:55.306 --> 02:31:56.307
IN OUR COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:57.107
HAVE.

02:31:57.174 --> 02:31:59.043

02:32:03.747 --> 02:32:05.783
OXYGEN.

02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:08.219
FUEL AND IGNITION.

02:32:08.285 --> 02:32:09.753
THERE'S TWO THINGS WE CAN'T

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:12.556
CONTROL OXYGEN AND IGNITION BUT

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:14.692
WE CAN'T CONTROL THE FUEL.

02:32:14.758 --> 02:32:16.126
THAT'S FOR ME TO TARGET WE NEED

02:32:16.193 --> 02:32:17.895
A TARGET ON THE FUEL MAKE OUR

02:32:17.962 --> 02:32:19.063
COMMUNITY SAFE.

AS SAFE AS WE CAN AND THIS IS A

02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.534
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO

02:32:23.601 --> 02:32:25.402
STABILIZE OUR UTILITIES AND THEN

02:32:25.469 --> 02:32:26.570
WE NEED TO TACKLE THE BIG

02:32:26.637 --> 02:32:28.138
PROBLEM WHICH IS VEGETATION

02:32:28.205 --> 02:32:29.907

THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS I

02:32:42.186 --> 02:32:43.454
WANTED TO SEE IN A BILL AND

02:32:43.521 --> 02:32:45.723

FORGET THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.382
BEHIND POLICIES.

02:33:11.448 --> 02:33:12.816
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:33:12.883 --> 02:33:15.085
PRIORITIZE OUR TAXPAYERS OVER

02:33:15.152 --> 02:33:16.554

SIT ON THE NEWLY CREATED.

02:33:32.703 --> 02:33:34.305
WHILE FIRE SAFETY BOARD

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:36.206
ADDITIONALLY IT WILL ALLOW THE

02:33:36.273 --> 02:33:37.508
COMMISSION TO REGULARLY CHECK

02:33:37.575 --> 02:33:39.009

GOOD FAITH BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE

02:33:54.258 --> 02:33:59.163
TO TAP INTO THE WILDFIRE FUND.

02:33:59.229 --> 02:33:59.964
MEMBERS EXECUTIVES CANNOT

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:01.298
CONTINUE TO MAKE PROFITS ON THE

02:34:01.365 --> 02:34:02.733
BACKS OF TRAGEDIES.

AND EXPECT DIFFERENT RESULTS.

02:34:08.405 --> 02:34:09.340
THAT'S WHAT I'M ENCOURAGED TO

PRESIDENT I RISE -- FRANKLY

02:36:46.597 --> 02:36:48.966
RELUCTANTLY AND RESPECTFULLY --

02:36:49.032 --> 02:36:51.335
IN OPPOSITION I TO TO THIS

02:36:51.401 --> 02:36:52.703
LEGISLATION AND I SAY

02:36:52.770 --> 02:36:54.471
RELUCTANTLY ON BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:56.807
LOT OF GOOD IN THIS LEGISLATION.

02:36:56.874 --> 02:36:58.942
ON A LOT OF REALLY GOOD WORK BY

02:36:59.009 --> 02:37:01.378
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BY AUTHORS

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:03.380
I WENT INTO THIS BILL -- AND

02:37:03.447 --> 02:37:05.315
THIS BILL WILL HAVE BENEFITS FOR

02:37:05.382 --> 02:37:07.518
REPAIRS ON YOU KNOW THE I KNOW

02:37:07.584 --> 02:37:09.720
THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE WHO SAY

02:37:09.787 --> 02:37:11.255
THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE

02:37:11.321 --> 02:37:12.923
SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD BE A 100%.

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:14.358
RESPONSIBLE AND WE NEED TO KNOW

02:37:14.424 --> 02:37:16.059
AND REPAIRS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO

02:37:16.126 --> 02:37:18.595
BEAR ANY OF THE COSTS OF THESE

02:37:18.662 --> 02:37:20.998
WILDFIRES I WISH THAT WERE TRUE

02:37:21.064 --> 02:37:22.199
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING -- BUT NO

02:37:22.266 --> 02:37:24.468
MATTER WHAT WE DO WHETHER WE DO

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:25.602
NOTHING OR DO SOMETHING.

02:37:25.669 --> 02:37:27.504
REPAIRS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE

02:37:27.571 --> 02:37:29.673
PART OF THE SOLUTION -- AND I

02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:30.541
THINK THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THIS

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:33.911
BILL THAT WILL MAKE THINGS-BETTER OP.

02:37:33.977 --> 02:37:36.313
TIRES ON I ALSO BELIEVE IT IS

02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:38.382
CRITICAL THAT WE STABILIZE OUR

02:37:38.448 --> 02:37:39.917
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THEY

02:37:39.983 --> 02:37:42.319
ARE UNSTABLE RIGHT NOW AND THERE

02:37:42.386 --> 02:37:43.587
ARE ASPECTS OF THIS BILL.

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:46.857
THAT WILL STABILIZE OUR OHIO USE.

02:37:46.924 --> 02:37:48.892
MY CONCERN -- AND THE REASON WHY

02:37:48.959 --> 02:37:50.394
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS

02:37:50.460 --> 02:37:51.562
BILL TODAY AND I'M NOT IN ANY

02:37:51.628 --> 02:37:53.463
WAY CRITICAL OF ANYONE ELSE FOR

02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:54.765
SUPPORTING A CAUSE I COMPLETELY

02:37:54.832 --> 02:37:57.100
UNDERSTAND WHY THESE ISSUES ARE

02:37:57.167 --> 02:37:57.868
SO IMPORTANT.

02:37:57.935 --> 02:38:00.070
IS THAT -- WE ARE IN A TRIAGE

02:38:00.137 --> 02:38:01.471
SITUATION WITH OUR INVESTOR

02:38:01.538 --> 02:38:03.407
OWNED UTILITIES BUT I ALSO

02:38:03.473 --> 02:38:04.808
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO TAKE

02:38:04.875 --> 02:38:06.944
WHAT IS A BROKEN MODEL RIGHT NOW

02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:08.712
IN TERMS OF FIRE USING

02:38:08.779 --> 02:38:14.651
CALIFORNIA.

02:38:14.718 --> 02:38:15.285
AND WE NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS THE

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:16.320
FUTURE.

02:38:16.386 --> 02:38:17.421
BUT I THINK WE IT WAS A MISSED

02:38:17.487 --> 02:38:18.922
OPPORTUNITY NOT TO INCLUDE OTHER

02:38:18.989 --> 02:38:20.457
ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL TO MOVE US

02:38:20.524 --> 02:38:21.291
IN THAT DIRECTION -- THE MOST

02:38:21.358 --> 02:38:22.426
SPECIFICALLY -- I AM VERY

02:38:22.492 --> 02:38:23.627
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WAS ADDED

02:38:23.694 --> 02:38:25.295
INTO THE BILL LAST WEEK -- THAT

02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:27.664
WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ON MAKE IT

02:38:27.731 --> 02:38:29.466
SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER -- TO

02:38:29.533 --> 02:38:31.835
CREATE -- MUNICIPAL UTILITY A

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:34.004
PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY WOR FOR

02:38:34.071 --> 02:38:35.505
A PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY TO BE

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:38.208
ABLE TO EXPAND BY ACQUIRING

02:38:38.275 --> 02:38:41.778
ASSETS FROM AND I OWE YOU -- I

02:38:41.845 --> 02:38:43.213
YOU KNOW THAT THIS DRAMATICALLY

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:45.749
INCREASES THE CPU SEES OVERSIGHT

02:38:45.816 --> 02:38:48.252
AND THE STANDARDS REQUIRED -- TO

02:38:48.318 --> 02:38:49.987
BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE

02:38:50.053 --> 02:38:52.155
ACQUISITIONS -- SO AS A RESULT

02:38:52.222 --> 02:38:54.591
BECAUSE I'M A STRONG BELIEVER --

02:38:54.658 --> 02:38:56.493
THAT ARE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES

02:38:56.560 --> 02:39:00.898
WHETHER WATER POWER CALIFORNIA.

02:39:00.964 --> 02:39:01.999
I'VE BEEN A VERY POSITIVE FORCE

02:39:02.065 --> 02:39:03.000
IN THE STATE -- I DO BELIEVE WE

02:39:03.066 --> 02:39:04.301
NEED TO LOOK AT THOSE MODELS FOR

02:39:04.368 --> 02:39:06.169
A FUTURE WITH A MORE SUSTAINABLE

02:39:06.236 --> 02:39:08.639
AND RESILIENT -- ELECTRIC SYSTEM

02:39:08.705 --> 02:39:10.574
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I

02:39:10.641 --> 02:39:12.476
BELIEVE IT THIS ONE PROVISION --

02:39:12.542 --> 02:39:14.578
IS VERY DETRIMENTAL THAT HAVE --

02:39:14.645 --> 02:39:17.614
FOR AND AS A RESULT I WILL NOT

02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:18.181
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL

02:39:18.248 --> 02:39:18.882
TODAY THANK YOU.

02:39:18.949 --> 02:39:22.019

THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN WILD FIRE

02:39:32.863 --> 02:39:35.632
VICTIMS AS A CLASS OF PEOPLE OR

02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:37.267
SOME GENERIC [inaudible]

02:39:37.334 --> 02:39:42.139
GROUP BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE REAL.

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:43.840
I WAS ONE OF THEM IN SOME SMALL

02:39:43.907 --> 02:39:45.976
RESPECT I'M A RENTER AND I DON'T

02:39:46.043 --> 02:39:46.710
DESERVE.

02:39:46.777 --> 02:39:48.211
PUBLIC SYMPATHY BECAUSE I WENT

02:39:48.278 --> 02:39:49.279
THROUGH A LOT LESS THAN MANY

02:39:49.346 --> 02:39:50.614
OTHER PEOPLE I STILL HAVE MY

02:39:50.681 --> 02:39:52.716
LIFE.

02:39:52.783 --> 02:39:56.353
I LOST THINGS -- BUT I WASN'T

02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:57.921
BROKEN FINANCIALLY I HAD A

02:39:57.988 --> 02:40:00.624
FAMILY TO GO -- TO WARM BED TO

02:40:00.691 --> 02:40:04.027
SLEEP IN -- STILL TO GO THROUGH

02:40:04.094 --> 02:40:07.431
THE PROCESS OF WHAT IT FEELS

02:40:07.497 --> 02:40:09.800
LIKE WHEN EVERYTHING BURNS DOWN.

02:40:09.866 --> 02:40:11.134
AND THAT'S WEIGHED HEAVILY ON MY

02:40:11.201 --> 02:40:12.669
MIND.

02:40:12.736 --> 02:40:14.104
THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS

02:40:14.171 --> 02:40:16.373
IS THAT.

02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:18.408
I THIS ISN'T JUST POLICY.

02:40:18.475 --> 02:40:21.178
IT'S ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

02:40:21.244 --> 02:40:22.546
AND WHEN THE GOVERNOR SHOWED UP

02:40:22.612 --> 02:40:25.582
IN THE ASHES THE WILL THE FIRE.

02:40:25.649 --> 02:40:29.486
AS A NEWLY ELECTED IN -- THE

02:40:29.553 --> 02:40:32.556
SHRINE.

02:40:32.622 --> 02:40:33.924
LEADER AT THE HELP ME SAID I'M A

02:40:33.991 --> 02:40:36.693

WE GOT ACT ON CLIMATE THIS YEAR.

02:40:38.729 --> 02:40:40.330
AND THAT MEANS DEALING WITH HIS

02:40:40.397 --> 02:40:43.033
WILD FIRE RISK.

02:40:43.100 --> 02:40:44.001
AND I THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

02:40:44.067 --> 02:40:46.370
FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS WORK.

02:40:46.436 --> 02:40:48.138
AND FOR ALL THE UNFINISHED

02:40:48.205 --> 02:40:49.072

AND I ONE EIGHT KNOWLEDGE.

02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:54.678
SERVER SAN FRANCISCO.

02:40:54.745 --> 02:40:57.180
AND OTHERS HERE WHO ON THE

02:40:57.247 --> 02:40:58.648
ASSEMBLY SIDE AND IN OUR

02:40:58.715 --> 02:41:00.584
INSURANCE COMMITTEES WHO WHO HAD

02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:02.285
KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S MUCH

02:41:02.352 --> 02:41:03.520
UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:04.888
WITH THE INSURANCE NON RENEWALS

02:41:04.955 --> 02:41:06.456
OCCURRING.

02:41:06.523 --> 02:41:07.290
WITH THIS SORT OF FEELING A

02:41:07.357 --> 02:41:08.792
DISEMPOWERMENT THE PEOPLE FEEL

02:41:08.859 --> 02:41:10.427
WHEN THEY LIVE IN THIS WILDLAND

02:41:10.494 --> 02:41:11.762
URBAN INTERFACE WITH THEY SAY.

02:41:11.828 --> 02:41:14.798
WE WE DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO

02:41:14.865 --> 02:41:15.999
CONTROL THESE WILDFIRES THAT

02:41:16.066 --> 02:41:17.367
SACRAMENTO MAKE SOME DECISIONS

02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:19.503
BUT WE SIT HERE IN THE WE WE

02:41:19.569 --> 02:41:21.538
POWERLESS.

02:41:21.605 --> 02:41:23.206
THEY'RE ON A RESPIRATOR LIVING

02:41:23.273 --> 02:41:24.641
IN A NURSING HOME OR THEY'RE

02:41:24.708 --> 02:41:26.309
LIVING AMONGST IN A TEN FOOT

02:41:26.376 --> 02:41:28.612
HIGH MUSTARD PLANTS AND THEY

02:41:28.678 --> 02:41:29.079
WONDER.

02:41:29.146 --> 02:41:29.679
HOW'S IT GOING.

02:41:29.746 --> 02:41:31.214
TO HOW MY GONNA PROTECT MY

02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:33.850
FAMILY AND MY PROPERTY WHEN THIS

02:41:33.917 --> 02:41:34.451
HAPPENS AGAIN BECAUSE IT WILL

02:41:34.518 --> 02:41:35.919
HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:41:35.986 --> 02:41:36.686
IT'S NOT A MATTER OF IF IT'S

02:41:36.753 --> 02:41:38.922
MATTER WHEN.

02:41:38.989 --> 02:41:40.724
SO WITH THAT UNFINISHED BUSINESS

02:41:40.791 --> 02:41:42.426
WE NEED TO GIVE COMMUNITIES

02:41:42.492 --> 02:41:43.727
THOSE TOOLS TO HARDEN THEIR

02:41:43.794 --> 02:41:46.163
HOMES ON A COMMUNITY BASIS.

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.631
THE USE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

02:41:47.697 --> 02:41:49.599
RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN

02:41:49.666 --> 02:41:51.134
THERE'S TE ENERGY IS ATION THAT

02:41:51.201 --> 02:41:52.669
THEIR POWER DOESN'T GO DOWN IT

02:41:52.736 --> 02:41:54.204
HURT THEIR HEALTH.

02:41:54.271 --> 02:41:56.073
OR TURN OFF THE RESPIRATOR OR

02:41:56.139 --> 02:41:57.307
MAKE THOSE COOLING CENTERS OF

02:41:57.374 --> 02:41:58.475
THOSE OTHER EVACUATION CENTER

02:41:58.542 --> 02:42:00.510
SHUT DOWN WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT

02:42:00.577 --> 02:42:02.813
RISK AND THOSE AREN'T SOLVED IN

02:42:02.879 --> 02:42:04.047
THIS BILL.

02:42:04.114 --> 02:42:05.515
SO WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO THIS

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:08.018
SESSION ON THIS FRONT.

02:42:08.085 --> 02:42:09.553
BUT THE REASON I'M RISING IN

02:42:09.619 --> 02:42:12.255
SUPPORT TODAY'S BECAUSE I DON'T

02:42:12.322 --> 02:42:14.157
THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT.

02:42:14.224 --> 02:42:14.691
ON THIS CRITICAL PIECE THE

02:42:14.758 --> 02:42:16.560
FORMULA.

02:42:16.626 --> 02:42:19.396
PEOPLE WILL BE HURT.

02:42:19.463 --> 02:42:21.998
VICTIMS WILL BE DENIED JUSTICE.

02:42:22.065 --> 02:42:22.999
IF WE ALLOW THE SYSTEM TO

02:42:23.066 --> 02:42:25.102
COLLAPSE.

02:42:25.168 --> 02:42:27.070
AND DENY THEIR CLAIMS AND EXTEND

02:42:27.137 --> 02:42:29.439
THEM FOR ANOTHER THOUSAND DAYS

02:42:29.506 --> 02:42:31.141
THOSE OF THOSE OF YOUR

02:42:31.208 --> 02:42:31.741
CONSTITUENTS WHO WENT THROUGH

02:42:31.808 --> 02:42:32.676
TUBS.

02:42:32.742 --> 02:42:34.811
OR NORTH BAY FOR NAPA THEY'RE

ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS.

02:46:18.435 --> 02:46:19.769
THIS IS ACTUALLY AN ARGUMENT

02:46:19.836 --> 02:46:21.304
MADE BY MERRILL LYNCH FOR THE

02:46:21.371 --> 02:46:23.573
LONGEST TIME AND LITIGATION IT

CUT A STRATEGY BUT IT WAS SAYS

02:46:26.810 --> 02:46:28.178
SOMETHING THAT WAS -- PROFFERED

02:46:28.244 --> 02:46:30.180
IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF OUR

02:46:30.246 --> 02:46:31.781

02:46:32.482 --> 02:46:35.085
ASSISTANCE FROM A BIG PLAYER

02:46:35.151 --> 02:46:36.586
THAT HAD A LARGE PORTFOLIO.

02:46:36.653 --> 02:46:37.954
SAME THING SORT OF HAPPEN IN THE

02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:40.657
STATE OF ALABAMA FEW YEARS AGO

02:46:40.724 --> 02:46:42.559
THE COUNTY OF JEFFERSON

02:46:42.625 --> 02:46:43.193
JEFFERSON COUNTY.

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:45.795
FOUND ITSELF -- WITH A FOUR

02:46:45.862 --> 02:46:47.297
BILLION DOLLAR INTEREST RATE

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:48.231
SWAP DEAL.

02:46:48.298 --> 02:46:50.633
AND THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN TWO

02:46:50.700 --> 02:46:51.301
THOUSAND EIGHT THE MIDDLE OF THE

02:46:51.368 --> 02:46:52.068
CREDIT CRISIS.

02:46:52.135 --> 02:46:54.304
AND THEY HAD TO PURCHASE PAPER

02:46:54.371 --> 02:46:56.806
EVERY WEEK CALL IT A PUT.

02:46:56.873 --> 02:46:59.075
AND THEY WERE PAYING 15% SOME

02:46:59.142 --> 02:47:00.577
HIGHER RATES WHEN THEY SHOULD

02:47:00.643 --> 02:47:02.612
HAVE BEEN ONE OR TWO NOW THE

02:47:02.679 --> 02:47:03.513
STATE TREASURER COULD A JUMPED

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:04.981
IN AND PURCHASED.

02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:07.350
THEIR PUTS THEN THEY COULD AT A

02:47:07.417 --> 02:47:09.552
SMALL PRMIUM AND SAVE THAT

02:47:09.619 --> 02:47:12.322
COUNTY A LOT OF MONEY AND IT

02:47:12.389 --> 02:47:13.556
WOULD HAVE SAVED THE TAXPAYERS

02:47:13.623 --> 02:47:15.024
BUT INSTEAD JEFFERSON COUNTY HAD

02:47:15.091 --> 02:47:17.193
TO FILE FOR CHAPTER. NINE

02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:19.496
BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION AS WELL SO

02:47:19.562 --> 02:47:21.131
WITH THAT IDEA IF.

02:47:21.197 --> 02:47:22.899
IF OUR TREASURE COULD PURCHASE

02:47:22.966 --> 02:47:25.034
COMMERCIAL PAPER FROM THE I. O.

02:47:25.101 --> 02:47:27.437
USE -- CHARGE A LITTLE PREMIUM

02:47:27.504 --> 02:47:29.205
FOR TAKING THE RISK BUT THAT'S A

02:47:29.272 --> 02:47:31.040
WHOLE LOT LESS THAN WHAT THEY

02:47:31.107 --> 02:47:33.910
WOULD PAY IN THE OPEN MARKET

02:47:33.977 --> 02:47:35.612
THAT'S YOU WOULD IN A SENSE.

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:36.212
YOU WOULD YOU WOULD YOU WOULD

02:47:36.279 --> 02:47:38.014
PAY THE TAXPAYERS FOR TAKING ON

02:47:38.081 --> 02:47:39.082
THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT YOU

02:47:39.149 --> 02:47:40.750
WOULDN'T.

02:47:40.817 --> 02:47:43.019
PENALIZE THE RATE PAYERS SO MUCH

02:47:43.086 --> 02:47:43.319
[inaudible]

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:45.688
BY.

02:47:45.755 --> 02:47:46.689
ARE NOT CHARGING A YOU KNOW AN

02:47:46.756 --> 02:47:48.892
EXORBITANT AMOUNT AND IT WOULD

02:47:48.958 --> 02:47:51.461
BE A GOOD SIGN OF PARTNERSHIP

02:47:51.528 --> 02:47:53.329
BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE TIED

02:47:53.396 --> 02:47:53.863
TO THE HIP.

02:47:53.930 --> 02:47:55.632
WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT

02:47:55.698 --> 02:47:58.034
IS THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:47:58.101 --> 02:47:58.935
COMMISSION.

02:47:59.002 --> 02:48:01.037
THAT DICTATES WHAT RATES ARE

02:48:01.104 --> 02:48:02.372
SPENT WHAT PRIORITIES ARE

02:48:02.439 --> 02:48:04.174
SUPPOSED TO BE PURSUED AND WE

02:48:04.240 --> 02:48:06.075
COULD HAVE A LONG DISCUSSION IF

02:48:06.142 --> 02:48:08.511
WE HAD THE TIME ON HOW IT COULD

02:48:08.578 --> 02:48:09.679
HAVE PERHAPS.

02:48:09.746 --> 02:48:11.748
ACTED DIFFERENTLY SO HERE WE

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:14.083
HAVE MAYBE A CHANCE TO BUY SOME

02:48:14.150 --> 02:48:15.919
TIME TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:48:15.985 --> 02:48:17.320
SOME DISCUSSION.

02:48:17.387 --> 02:48:20.156
AND EVERYBODY SORT OF WINS WE

02:48:20.223 --> 02:48:22.725
WOULDN'T BE BEHOLDEN.

02:48:22.792 --> 02:48:24.494
TO CREDIT RATING AGENCIES AND

02:48:24.561 --> 02:48:26.329
I'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE AND I'VE.

02:48:26.396 --> 02:48:28.665
TO GET MORE STORIES ABOUT THAT

02:48:28.731 --> 02:48:30.500
SO I RESPECT ALL THE WORK THAT'S

02:48:30.567 --> 02:48:32.068
BEEN DONE AND IT'S BEEN DONE IN

02:48:32.135 --> 02:48:34.404
A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

02:48:34.471 --> 02:48:35.605
BUT I WILL SAY IT IS A LITTLE

02:48:35.672 --> 02:48:38.641
RUSHED FOR SOMETHING AS MASSIVE

02:48:38.708 --> 02:48:40.777
IS THIS AND THERE IS A WAY TO

02:48:40.844 --> 02:48:42.479
FIND A LITTLE MORE TIME WORKING

02:48:42.545 --> 02:48:43.746
WITH THE RATING AGENCIES.

02:48:43.813 --> 02:48:45.715
I'M JUST SORRY THE PERCEIVED

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:47.450
IMMEDIACY IS DICTATING THE PACE

02:48:47.517 --> 02:48:50.019
OF AB TEN FIFTY FOUR I WOULD

02:48:50.086 --> 02:48:51.254
HAVE LOVED TO SEE A FIFTEEN YEAR

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:52.555
STRATEGIC FINANCIAL PLAN FROM

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.757
OUR I USED JUST TO SEE HOW

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:56.292
EVERYTHING WOULD PENCIL OUT WORK

02:48:56.359 --> 02:48:59.729
OUT -- BUT I GUESS I GUESS.

02:48:59.796 --> 02:49:00.964
I SHOULD BE HAPPY MAYBE STATE

02:49:01.030 --> 02:49:01.664
GOVERNMENT.

02:49:01.731 --> 02:49:03.132
CAN ACT QUICKLY.

SINCE THE FIRE STARTED.

02:49:35.131 --> 02:49:38.067
IN THE THROES OF THE FIRE.

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:42.305

02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:54.117
WROTE.

02:49:54.183 --> 02:49:57.387

LEGISLATION.

02:50:01.491 --> 02:50:03.793
THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT MATTER.

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:04.928
I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE JUST

02:50:04.994 --> 02:50:06.596

THAT THEY WILL GET SOME HELP.

02:50:25.715 --> 02:50:28.451
THIS OFFERS THEM HELP.

02:50:28.518 --> 02:50:30.553
I DON'T ARGUE THAT THIS IS A

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:34.624
BAILOUT OF GREEDY UTILITIES.

02:50:34.691 --> 02:50:35.658
THERE ARE MANY PROVISIONS IN

THE HELP CONSTRUCT CONSTRAIN

02:50:55.178 --> 02:50:59.182
URGENCY. TO THOSE CITIZENS.

02:50:59.248 --> 02:51:01.384
IN THESE FIRE [inaudible]

02:51:01.451 --> 02:51:03.853
INFLAMED AREAS.

02:51:03.920 --> 02:51:05.755
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE DECISIONS

02:51:05.822 --> 02:51:07.624
NOW ABOUT THEIR OWN FUTURES.

02:51:07.690 --> 02:51:08.825
THAT THEY LOST EVERYTHING THAT

02:51:08.891 --> 02:51:10.259

02:51:18.267 --> 02:51:20.570
OF A FUTURE.

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:22.639
AND VERY PARTICULAR THAT THERE'S

02:51:22.705 --> 02:51:24.641
A LONG TERM PLAN.

02:51:24.707 --> 02:51:26.009
THAT WE WILL MINIMIZE THE

02:51:26.075 --> 02:51:27.410
PROBABILITY OF THIS HAPPENING

02:51:27.477 --> 02:51:30.146
EVER AGAIN.

02:51:30.213 --> 02:51:31.981
AND NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS

02:51:32.048 --> 02:51:33.883
ENSURING.

02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:36.619
A ONGOING PROGRAM.

02:51:36.686 --> 02:51:38.488

OUR BACKS ON THEM AS WE DID HERE

02:51:41.891 --> 02:51:44.227
FOR DECADES IN THIS STATE.

02:51:44.293 --> 02:51:47.163

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:55.138
WE MUST NOT REPLICATE THAT.

02:51:55.204 --> 02:51:56.406

PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET.

02:52:01.544 --> 02:52:04.514
THE GOVERNORS HAVE BEEN HELPFUL.

02:52:04.580 --> 02:52:05.615
THIS GOVERNOR WAS WHETHER FROM

02:52:05.682 --> 02:52:07.984

AND THIS IS INDEED A BIG PART.

02:52:30.039 --> 02:52:31.774
ONE OF THE CHANGES IN THIS

02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:34.010

ABOUT IS ABOUT.

02:56:48.764 --> 02:56:50.466
PEOPLE WHO ARE FACED WITH BILLS

02:56:50.533 --> 02:56:52.435
THAT THEY CAN'T PAY AND TRYING

02:56:52.501 --> 02:56:53.769
TO REORGANIZE THEMSELVES.

02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:57.373
AND I THINK WHEN THE FOUNDING

02:56:57.440 --> 02:56:58.941
SEPARATE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:56:59.008 --> 02:57:00.409
FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT THERE

02:57:00.476 --> 02:57:02.345
WAS A BALANCE AND I THINK PART

02:57:02.411 --> 02:57:03.679
OF THE PROVISION THAT WE HAVE

02:57:03.746 --> 02:57:04.180
HERE.

02:57:04.246 --> 02:57:06.048
IN THE IN THE BILL THAT

02:57:06.115 --> 02:57:09.652
INCENTIVIZE IS THE STATE THE I.

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:10.953
O. USING P.JEANNIE AND

TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS FUN SO

02:57:14.557 --> 02:57:16.125

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO TO HAVE

02:57:17.593 --> 02:57:19.228
ACCESS TO THE MONEY AND ALSO THE

02:57:19.295 --> 02:57:20.596
PAY THESE CLAIMS.

02:57:20.663 --> 02:57:22.865
IS THE RIGHT BALANCE THAT THE

02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:24.300
FOUNDING FATHERS THOUGHT THAT

02:57:24.367 --> 02:57:25.434
THE CITY WHAT CAN CALIFORNIA

02:57:25.501 --> 02:57:27.470

AT LEAST MY READING OF THE BILL

02:57:36.612 --> 02:57:38.547
IN THE DAYS THAT WE'VE HAD IT IS

02:57:38.614 --> 02:57:40.483

CALIFORNIA AND SOMEDAY IN THE

02:58:06.709 --> 02:58:08.477

WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS IF IT

02:59:27.356 --> 02:59:29.825
WERE A BAILOUT FOR THE UTILITIES

02:59:29.892 --> 02:59:31.660
OBVIOUSLY LAST YEAR.

02:59:31.727 --> 02:59:33.662

03:00:14.537 --> 03:00:17.706
ALLOW ANY PROFIT ON ANY OF THAT

03:00:17.773 --> 03:00:19.341

03:01:58.974 --> 03:02:00.909
THIS WAS NOT AN EASY DECISION

03:02:00.976 --> 03:02:03.679
FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN SINCE

03:02:03.746 --> 03:02:05.147

AND WHAT I FOUND WAS A UTILITY

03:02:11.487 --> 03:02:12.554
THAT WAS.

03:02:12.621 --> 03:02:14.356
DIVERTING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

03:02:14.423 --> 03:02:16.292
OF DOLLARS FROM SAFETY.

03:02:16.358 --> 03:02:18.794
FROM MAINTENANCE FROM OPERATIONS

03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:25.100
UTILITIES COMMISSION?

03:02:25.167 --> 03:02:27.736

WHO IS CORRUPTED LEADERSHIP?

03:02:30.072 --> 03:02:31.840
IT WAS CORRUPT IN THE MANNER IN

03:02:31.907 --> 03:02:33.208
WHICH YOU DEALT.

03:02:33.275 --> 03:02:35.244
WITH ITS UTILITIES INCESTUOUS

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:37.012
WAS THE RELATIONSHIP A COZY

03:02:37.079 --> 03:02:38.480
RELATIONSHIP WHERE THEY WALKED

03:02:38.547 --> 03:02:39.581
THE HALLS OF THE PUBLIC

03:02:39.648 --> 03:02:40.916
UTILITIES COMMISSION.

03:02:40.983 --> 03:02:42.918
ON A REGULAR BASIS TALKING TO

03:02:42.985 --> 03:02:44.887
THE STAFF.

03:02:44.953 --> 03:02:47.623
KEEPING THAT RELATIONSHIP CLOSE.

03:02:47.690 --> 03:02:49.325
WHICH DIFFICULT TO WATCH.

03:02:49.391 --> 03:02:51.560
AS I SAW THE POWER OF THOSE YET

03:02:51.627 --> 03:02:54.563
UTILITIES IN THIS BUILDING.

03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:56.765
THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT FACED

03:02:56.832 --> 03:02:57.399
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS SO LAST

03:02:57.466 --> 03:02:58.534
YEAR.

03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:01.236
AFTER THE WILDFIRES OF TWENTY

03:03:01.303 --> 03:03:02.137
SEVENTEEN AND AS I SAW.

03:03:02.204 --> 03:03:03.839
SB.

03:03:03.906 --> 03:03:04.773
NINE OH ONE I DID NOT VOTE FOR

03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:06.208
THAT LEGISLATION BECAUSE FRANKLY

03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:07.643
I DID FEEL.

03:03:07.710 --> 03:03:09.511
IT WAS A BAILOUT.

03:03:09.578 --> 03:03:12.014
I FELT THAT IT GAVE OPPORTUNITY

03:03:12.081 --> 03:03:13.015
FOR THE UTILITIES FOR P. JEANNIE

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:14.350
ESPECIALLY [inaudible]

03:03:14.416 --> 03:03:17.920
THE BENEFIT. TO GET PAID.

03:03:17.986 --> 03:03:19.655
THE END TO GET RELIEF FROM

03:03:19.722 --> 03:03:22.324
HAVING TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT TO

03:03:22.391 --> 03:03:24.293
THE VICTIMS OF THOSE FIRES.

03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:26.495
I SAW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:03:26.562 --> 03:03:28.030
THEM I SAW WAS CLEAR.

03:03:28.097 --> 03:03:30.666
IN A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY.

03:03:30.733 --> 03:03:32.101
AND NOW AFTER THEY FILED FOR

03:03:32.167 --> 03:03:33.902
BANKRUPTCY IT IS MORE A CLEAR

03:03:33.969 --> 03:03:35.571
POSSIBILITY.

03:03:35.637 --> 03:03:37.172
BECAUSE THEY HAVE.

03:03:37.239 --> 03:03:39.174
NO RESOURCES TO COMPENSATE THOSE

03:03:39.241 --> 03:03:41.710
VICTIMS.

03:03:41.777 --> 03:03:43.879
THIS LEGISLATION SOLVE A LOT OF

03:03:43.946 --> 03:03:45.647
THOSE PROBLEMS BECAUSE TO ME THE

03:03:45.714 --> 03:03:47.716
ISSUE IS WE WANT OUR UTILITIES

03:03:47.783 --> 03:03:49.151
TO SUCCEED IN CALIFORNIA.

03:03:49.218 --> 03:03:50.319
WE WANT THEM TO HAVE THE

03:03:50.386 --> 03:03:52.020
RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO BORROW

03:03:52.087 --> 03:03:54.056
THOSE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THAT

03:03:54.123 --> 03:03:55.491
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S NECESSARY

03:03:55.557 --> 03:03:57.960
FOR A SOUND UTILITY.

03:03:58.026 --> 03:03:59.661
END THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO

03:03:59.728 --> 03:04:01.063
THAT.

03:04:01.130 --> 03:04:02.531
IT WILL ALLOW THEM TO DO IT IN A

03:04:02.598 --> 03:04:05.000
WAY THAT PROVIDE STABILITY TO

03:04:05.067 --> 03:04:06.101
THE MARKETS.

03:04:06.168 --> 03:04:07.603
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT DOES IT

03:04:07.669 --> 03:04:08.771
IN A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE RATE

03:04:08.837 --> 03:04:10.439
PAYERS BECAUSE THAT'S THE LENS

03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:11.840
WITH WHICH I HAVE BEEN LOOKING

03:04:11.907 --> 03:04:13.375
AT THIS LEGISLATION.

03:04:13.442 --> 03:04:15.511
IS THE LENS TO SEE AND MAKE SURE

03:04:15.577 --> 03:04:16.445
THAT THE RATE PAYERS ARE NOT

03:04:16.512 --> 03:04:18.213
PUNISHED.

03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:20.482
ARE NOT HELD TO A UP A LOWER

03:04:20.549 --> 03:04:22.084
STANDARD BASICALLY ARE A HIGHER

03:04:22.151 --> 03:04:23.018
STANDARD DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

03:04:23.085 --> 03:04:24.453
LOOK AT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

03:04:24.520 --> 03:04:25.921
HELD RESPONSIBLE.

03:04:25.988 --> 03:04:27.556
IN THOSE IN THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN

03:04:27.623 --> 03:04:29.224
AND EIGHTEEN FIRES.

03:04:29.291 --> 03:04:31.560
THEY ARE PROTECTED IN THIS.

03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:33.061
THE BAIL OUT OF NINE OH ONE IS

03:04:33.128 --> 03:04:35.030
NO LONGER IN EFFECT.

03:04:35.097 --> 03:04:36.899
BECAUSE P. JEANNIE OR THE RATE

03:04:36.965 --> 03:04:41.103
PAYERS WE COULD HAVE BEEN HELD.

03:04:41.170 --> 03:04:41.737
FOR TWENTY THIRTY FORTY BILLION

03:04:41.804 --> 03:04:43.639
DOLLARS TO COVER THE COST NOW

03:04:43.705 --> 03:04:45.407
WE'RE NOT.

03:04:45.474 --> 03:04:46.842
IS THIS LEGISLATION MOVES

03:04:46.909 --> 03:04:49.545
FORWARD WITH A CAP ON A REPAIR

03:04:49.611 --> 03:04:50.746
CONTRIBUTION A CAP.

03:04:50.813 --> 03:04:52.714
OF TEN POINT FIVE BILLION

03:04:52.781 --> 03:04:56.118
DOLLARS IT WILL GO BEYOND THAT.

03:04:56.185 --> 03:04:57.519
IN THAT'S THE EXPOSURE THAT WE

03:04:57.586 --> 03:04:59.321
HAVE WE COULD HAVE BEEN SADDLED

03:04:59.388 --> 03:05:01.423
WITH THIRTY FORTY FIFTY BILLION

03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:03.358
DOLLARS BUT NOW IT'S TEN POINT

03:05:03.425 --> 03:05:04.159
FIVE AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT

03:05:04.226 --> 03:05:05.794
WILL BE THE AMOUNT WE WILL HAVE

03:05:05.861 --> 03:05:06.528
TO PAY.

03:05:06.595 --> 03:05:08.130
AT THE END BECAUSE WE'RE NOT OUT

03:05:08.197 --> 03:05:09.598
OF THAT TEN AND A HALF BILLION

03:05:09.665 --> 03:05:11.633
GOING TO PAY. FOR THOSE VICTIMS

03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:14.036
OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY

03:05:14.102 --> 03:05:15.471
EIGHTEEN THAT WILL COME FROM P.

03:05:15.537 --> 03:05:16.805
JEANNIE AND IT SHOULD COME FROM

03:05:16.872 --> 03:05:19.208
PGA.

03:05:19.274 --> 03:05:20.709
I WAS IMPRESSED WHEN I SAW THE

03:05:20.776 --> 03:05:21.944
ORIGINAL [inaudible]

03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:23.946
BILL.

03:05:24.012 --> 03:05:25.314
WHEN THIS BILL CAME FORWARD AND

03:05:25.380 --> 03:05:27.082
WAS EXPLAINED HADN'T READ IT YET

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:28.283
BUT IT LOOKS GOOD?

03:05:28.350 --> 03:05:30.118
IT SOUNDED GOOD.

03:05:30.185 --> 03:05:31.820
THEN IN THE DETAILS THERE WERE

03:05:31.887 --> 03:05:33.188
SOME CHALLENGES CHALLENGES WITH

03:05:33.255 --> 03:05:35.123
LIABILITY HOW IS THAT GOING TO

03:05:35.190 --> 03:05:36.725
BE DEFINED TO PROTECT US AS WE

03:05:36.792 --> 03:05:38.527
GO FORWARD AS THOSE FIRES WILL

03:05:38.594 --> 03:05:39.828
COME AS WE WILL SEE.

03:05:39.895 --> 03:05:42.097
AND HOW WE DEFINE WHO'S GOING TO

03:05:42.164 --> 03:05:43.999
PAY FOR THOSE AT THE END.

03:05:44.066 --> 03:05:46.235
AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK WITH

03:05:46.301 --> 03:05:47.302
THE GOVERNOR'S STAFF WHO DID AN

03:05:47.369 --> 03:05:50.572
OUTSTANDING EXTRAORDINARY JOB.

03:05:50.639 --> 03:05:53.041
IN REACHING OUT COMMUNICATING IN

03:05:53.108 --> 03:05:55.911
TRYING TO TO CREATE A AND CRAFT

03:05:55.978 --> 03:05:57.646
A SOLUTION OF WORDS.

03:05:57.713 --> 03:05:59.715
IN THOSE WORDS MEAN SOMETHING IN

03:05:59.781 --> 03:06:02.017
THIS LEGISLATION AS IT GOES.

03:06:02.084 --> 03:06:04.386
FOR AS WE DEFINE RESPONSIBILITY

03:06:04.453 --> 03:06:06.321
AS WE DESPITE DEFINED REPAIR

03:06:06.388 --> 03:06:07.456
RESPONSIBILITY BUT MORE

03:06:07.523 --> 03:06:08.590
IMPORTANTLY AS WE DEFINED

03:06:08.657 --> 03:06:10.626
UTILITY RESPONSIBILITY AND

03:06:10.692 --> 03:06:11.727
LIABILITY.

03:06:11.793 --> 03:06:14.930
THIS BILL DID THAT IN DOES IT

03:06:14.997 --> 03:06:16.098
TODAY.

03:06:16.164 --> 03:06:17.799
THE IDEA OF EXECUTIVE

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:19.201
COMPENSATION.

03:06:19.268 --> 03:06:20.102
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE

03:06:20.168 --> 03:06:24.006
LEGISLATION ON EIGHT YEARS AGO.

03:06:24.072 --> 03:06:26.942
AFTER THE FIRE IN SAN BRUNO THE

03:06:27.009 --> 03:06:27.476
GAS EXPLOSION KILLED EIGHT

03:06:27.543 --> 03:06:28.977
PEOPLE.

03:06:29.044 --> 03:06:30.612
AND THE C. E. O. OF P. JEANNIE

03:06:30.679 --> 03:06:32.347
PETER DARBY LEFT THAT COMPANY

03:06:32.414 --> 03:06:34.082
WITH A TWENTY EIGHT MILLION

03:06:34.149 --> 03:06:36.218
DOLLARS GOLDEN PARACHUTE. TWENTY

03:06:36.285 --> 03:06:38.754
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

03:06:38.820 --> 03:06:40.022
THAT WON'T HAPPEN WITH THIS

03:06:40.088 --> 03:06:42.324
LEGISLATION.

03:06:42.391 --> 03:06:44.293
WILL BE PROTECTED FROM THAT.

03:06:44.359 --> 03:06:46.395
AND WE WON'T SEE THAT.

03:06:46.461 --> 03:06:47.829
AS REPAIRS ARE PROTECTED

03:06:47.896 --> 03:06:49.097
LIABILITY GOING FORWARD WILL BE

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:51.466
FAIR.

03:06:51.533 --> 03:06:53.335
IF THOSE UTILITIES BECAUSE THEIR

03:06:53.402 --> 03:06:56.138
NEGLIGENCE YOUR RESPONSIBILITY

03:06:56.204 --> 03:06:56.738
CAUSES THAT FIRE THEY'RE GOING

03:06:56.805 --> 03:06:57.873
TO PAY.

03:06:57.940 --> 03:07:00.275
IF IT'S NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

03:07:00.342 --> 03:07:00.576
[inaudible]

03:07:00.642 --> 03:07:03.712
IF IT'S THOUGHT NOT IF THEY

03:07:03.779 --> 03:07:05.447
HAVEN'T DONE AND RECEIVE THEIR

03:07:05.514 --> 03:07:06.782
CERTIFICATE THEIR SAFETY%

03:07:06.848 --> 03:07:09.151
CERTIFICATION AND IT IS AS THIS

03:07:09.217 --> 03:07:10.652
BILL NOW DOES.

03:07:10.719 --> 03:07:11.853
IT WILL BE MONITORED IT WILL BE

03:07:11.920 --> 03:07:14.222
INSPECTED IT WILL BE AUDITED IT

03:07:14.289 --> 03:07:15.357
WILL BE ANNUALLY CERTIFY

03:07:15.424 --> 03:07:17.025
RECERTIFIED IT'LL BE CHECKED ON

03:07:17.092 --> 03:07:18.393
A REGULAR BASIS IF THEY MEET

03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:20.228
THAT STANDARD.

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:21.763
IT'S A HIGH STANDARD IF THEY

03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:23.131
MEET THAT STANDARD AND SOMETHING

03:07:23.198 --> 03:07:24.533
HAPPENS.

03:07:24.600 --> 03:07:26.735
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT.

03:07:26.802 --> 03:07:28.904
AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY.

03:07:28.971 --> 03:07:29.972
AND WE SHOULD SHARE THAT

03:07:30.038 --> 03:07:31.807
RESPONSIBILITY.

03:07:31.873 --> 03:07:33.375
BECAUSE AND SOCIALIZE THAT COST

03:07:33.442 --> 03:07:34.543
BECAUSE WE ALL BENEFIT FROM

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:36.678
THOSE WIRES WILL BENEFIT FROM

03:07:36.745 --> 03:07:37.946
THAT ELECTRICITY.

03:07:38.013 --> 03:07:39.081
AND WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THAT

03:07:39.147 --> 03:07:40.916
OPPORTUNITY.

03:07:40.983 --> 03:07:42.317
SO WHEN I LOOK AT THE LIABILITY

03:07:42.384 --> 03:07:43.452
WHEN I LOOK AT THE EXECUTIVE

03:07:43.518 --> 03:07:44.953
COMPENSATION WHEN I LOOK AT THE

03:07:45.020 --> 03:07:47.189
REPAIR PROTECTION.

03:07:47.255 --> 03:07:48.123
IN A LOOK AT THE VICTIMS BEING

03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:49.858
PAID.

03:07:49.925 --> 03:07:51.326
I THINK THIS LEGISLATION AND I

03:07:51.393 --> 03:07:53.996
APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR I REALLY DO.

03:07:54.062 --> 03:07:55.497
BECAUSE HE TOOK THIS ON IN

03:07:55.564 --> 03:07:57.265
JANUARY HE TOOK AROUND PROBABLY

03:07:57.332 --> 03:07:58.433
BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED AFTER THE

03:07:58.500 --> 03:08:00.369
FIRES IN OCTOBER WHEN HE THOUGHT

03:08:00.435 --> 03:08:02.638
HE KNEW SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE.

03:08:02.704 --> 03:08:04.272
AND HE HAS WHAT I BELIEVE IS A

03:08:04.339 --> 03:08:06.108
HISTORY.

03:08:06.174 --> 03:08:08.210
WHERE HE COMES FROM FRANKLY OF

03:08:08.276 --> 03:08:10.712
P. JEANNIE?

03:08:10.779 --> 03:08:12.280
HE KNEW AND KNOWS THE TYPE OF

03:08:12.347 --> 03:08:14.282
COMPANY THAT THEY WERE.

03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:15.717
AND HE IS PROTECTING THE RATE

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:16.685
PAYERS IN THE PEOPLE OF

03:08:16.752 --> 03:08:18.153

TODAY AND MAKING THEM PAY IN THE

03:08:19.688 --> 03:08:20.956
END.

03:08:21.023 --> 03:08:22.357

03:09:49.778 --> 03:09:51.246
THEY HAVE PUT IN PLACE -- NOW

03:09:51.313 --> 03:09:53.548

WELL THEY DID THAT OUT OF

03:09:56.551 --> 03:09:59.020
NECESSITY AN OUT OF

03:09:59.087 --> 03:10:00.956
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE NOT

03:10:01.022 --> 03:10:02.190

03:10:10.832 --> 03:10:12.634
REPLICATED ASA AND THEY STAND ON

03:10:12.701 --> 03:10:15.270

03:10:23.712 --> 03:10:26.047
THEY WORK TO IMPROVE AND YET

03:10:26.114 --> 03:10:28.416
THEY STAND TO LOSE ALL THAT

03:10:28.483 --> 03:10:31.453
THEY'VE OBTAINED IT GAINED.

03:10:31.520 --> 03:10:33.488
ODD BECAUSE OF IT.

03:10:33.555 --> 03:10:35.524
ALL OF THE REASONS TO SUPPORT

03:10:35.590 --> 03:10:37.392
THIS LEGISLATION MY ELOQUENT

03:10:37.459 --> 03:10:38.927
COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED.

03:10:38.994 --> 03:10:41.163
THIS IS ABOUT RATE PAYERS THIS

03:10:41.229 --> 03:10:43.031
IS ABOUT FIRE VICTIMS THIS IS

03:10:43.098 --> 03:10:45.667
ABOUT COLLEAGUES WHO HAD TO PUT.

03:10:45.734 --> 03:10:47.602
HOURS OF THOUGHT INTO WHAT IT

03:10:47.669 --> 03:10:48.603
MEANS TO SUPPORT THIS

03:10:48.670 --> 03:10:50.372
LEGISLATION THIS IS ABOUT

03:10:50.438 --> 03:10:53.108
ARGUING WITH OURSELVES HAVE WE

03:10:53.175 --> 03:10:54.676
DONE ENOUGH.

03:10:54.743 --> 03:10:58.146
ARE WE ARE WE TAKING A RISK HERE.

03:10:58.213 --> 03:11:00.182
THAT WE'RE AFRAID MAY NOT

03:11:00.248 --> 03:11:01.750
PRODUCE WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO.

03:11:01.817 --> 03:11:03.418
ALL OF THOSE FEARS MAKE US WANT

03:11:03.485 --> 03:11:06.721
TO TAKE A STEP BACK I KNOW.

03:11:06.788 --> 03:11:08.490
BUT SHOULD WE NOT ACT.

03:11:08.557 --> 03:11:10.859
THE DAMAGE DONE GOING FORWARD

03:11:10.926 --> 03:11:14.296
WOULD BE MUCH MUCH MORE SEVERE.

03:11:14.362 --> 03:11:15.697
AND WE IN OUR FEAR WOULD BE

IRRESPONSIBLE TO OUR

CONSTITUENTS AND TO CALIFORNIA.

03:11:19.334 --> 03:11:21.670
SO IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE COME

03:11:21.736 --> 03:11:23.438
TOGETHER BAND TOGETHER AND DO

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:25.207

03:11:26.908 --> 03:11:28.977
DONE.

03:11:29.044 --> 03:11:30.579
CITIES AND COUNTIES NEED TO

03:11:30.645 --> 03:11:33.248
