CHINA CURRENTLY EMITS LIKE 20%

00:22:34.953 --> 00:22:36.655

00:22:36.722 --> 00:22:37.689

BILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.299
DIOXIDE SUIT YOU KNOW AND GIVEN

00:22:47.365 --> 00:22:49.267

UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL THIS.

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:14.672
THE CONVERSATION IS REALLY

00:31:14.739 --> 00:31:17.075
DRAFTED INTO. A LOT OF OTHER

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:19.644
THINGS SO- BUT I WANT TO JUST

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:21.446
MAKE A COMMENT THAT IN IN MY

00:31:21.512 --> 00:31:22.480
PERSPECTIVE I THINK THE

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:23.448
GOVERNOR BROUGHT UP A REALLY

00:31:23.514 --> 00:31:25.283
GOOD POINT ABOUT YOU KNOW FIRE

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.185
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THAT-

00:31:27.252 --> 00:31:28.886
THIS NOT IN THIS COMMITTEE MUCH

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:31.756
BUT- YOU CALIFORNIA'S LED THE

00:31:31.823 --> 00:31:33.858
WAY. WHEN IT COMES TO. LEADING

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:36.361
THE WORLD IN. THE BILL YOU TO

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:38.263
BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HOW

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.698
WE'RE GOING TO BE PROACTIVE IN

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:44.035
FIGHTING OFF CARBON EMISSIONS.

00:31:44.102 --> 00:31:45.637
I WOULD SAY WE'VE DONE WE'VE

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:48.006
SPENT THAT MONEY WE'VE TAX THE

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.240
PEOPLE IN THE BUSINESSES OF

00:31:49.307 --> 00:31:51.175
CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE RUN A LOT

00:31:51.242 --> 00:31:52.343
OF THEM OUT AND MANY OF THOSE

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:54.946
COMPANIES AND CORPORATIONS

00:31:55.013 --> 00:31:55.546
HAVE. GONE TO CHINA WHERE IT'S

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.815
A LOT EASIER- TO MANUFACTURE

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.350
AND PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS THAT

00:31:59.417 --> 00:32:01.653
WE ALL USE- IN AN ENVIRONMENT

00:32:01.719 --> 00:32:03.888
WHERE THEY DON'T. DO THE SAME

00:32:03.955 --> 00:32:04.989
THINGS WE DO HERE IN CALIFORNIA

00:32:05.056 --> 00:32:06.157
SO IT'S PUT CALIFORNIA AT A

00:32:06.224 --> 00:32:08.593
MAJOR DISADVANTAGE WHEN IT

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.496
COMES TO BEING ABLE TO. PRODUCE

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:13.097
THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY

00:32:13.164 --> 00:32:14.098
NEED HERE AND PROMOTE THE JOBS

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:16.401
HERE- AND THEN THE SECOND THING

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:19.370
IS THAT WE FOCUS ON THINGS THAT

00:32:19.437 --> 00:32:21.806
ARE- NOT ALWAYS THE BEST

00:32:21.873 --> 00:32:23.374
PRIORITY OF THE WAY WE SPEND

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:25.376
THE MONEY WE HAVE. I KNOW

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:26.010
SOMETHING THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:28.346
BEEN. IT'S NOT JUST GOVERNOR

00:32:28.413 --> 00:32:29.847
BUT GOVERNOR BROWN HAS BEEN

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:31.916
VERY ADAMANT ABOUT IT IS THE

00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:34.152
BULLET TRAIN AND- AND THAT IS

00:32:34.218 --> 00:32:36.354
IT IS IN MY OPINION HAS BEEN.

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.855
THE WORK THE BEST CASE OF THE

00:32:37.922 --> 00:32:39.557
WORST AMOUNT OF MONEY I EVER

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.591
SPENT ON TRYING TO REDUCE

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:43.928
CARBON- AND I DON'T KNOW IF

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:45.530
IT'LL EVER BE COMPLETED IN. AND

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:46.831
ANYWAY I THINK THAT'S THE OF

00:32:46.898 --> 00:32:48.900
SODOMY FOLKS ON AND TAKE THOSE

00:32:48.966 --> 00:32:50.234
RESOURCES AND SPEND THEM ON

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:52.003
AREAS WHERE WE KNOW. WE CAN

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.604
REALLY REDUCE CARBON WHICH IS.

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:56.341
FORCED BUYERS. AND SO I THINK

00:32:56.407 --> 00:32:58.242
THIS DISCUSSION HAS GONE IN THE

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.811
DIRECTION OF NOT REALLY CLOSE

00:32:59.877 --> 00:33:02.313
TO WHAT THE BILL. FOR THE GOAL

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.815
OF THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS

00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:06.084
TO DO AND SO FOR THOSE REASON

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:07.018
I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING IT

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.619
TODAY I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.355
GOOD POLICY DISCUSSION HERE-

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.889
THAT. IS NOT IN THIS COMMITTEES

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.658
EVEN RAIL AND SO MAYBE WE

00:33:13.725 --> 00:33:14.625
SHOULD HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS

00:33:14.692 --> 00:33:17.061
AND- MAYBE WE CAN GET THE

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:19.797
GOVERNOR- GOVERNOR BROWN TO

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:21.199
COME AND DEBATE SOME OF THOSE.

00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:22.300
OPTIONS THAT WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.035
HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO FOR THOSE

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:24.936
REASONS I WON'T BE SUPPORTING

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:26.270
THE BILL AND WE HAVE A LOT OF

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:27.739
WORK TO DO. ON OUR

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:29.874
RELATIONSHIP. WITH CHINA. IN A

00:33:29.941 --> 00:33:32.276
RELATIONSHIP WITH. THE HUMANS

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:33.945
THAT ARE PROVIDING THE THINGS

00:33:34.011 --> 00:33:35.079
WE USE OVER THERE AND THAT

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:37.515
THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.484
BASICALLY SLAVES LET'S FACE IT

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.218
MOST. POPULAR SAY WHAT IT

00:33:40.284 --> 00:33:42.387
REALLY IS. AND WE SHOULD BE

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.122
TALKING ABOUT THE HUMAN. SIDE

00:33:44.188 --> 00:33:46.391
OF THIS THING AND NOT SO MUCH-

00:33:46.457 --> 00:33:48.993
THE DIFFERENCES IN. HOW WE- GET

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:50.995
THE PRODUCTS WE NEED AND THE

00:33:51.062 --> 00:33:53.431
COST THE COST OF. WHAT HAPPENS

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.899
IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND THEY'RE

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:56.167
NOT THEY'RE NOT OUR FRIENDS AT

00:33:56.234 --> 00:33:56.901

TAKING OUR JOBS. AND OUR

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.271
POLLUTING OUR AIR THE SAME TIME

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:01.172

HEARTIT'S WHY IT'S HERE IN

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.586
THIS COMMITTEE. I THINK- IT

00:34:48.653 --> 00:34:50.721
WOULD BE SCARY IF WE WERE TO

00:34:50.788 --> 00:34:53.024
GET IN THE WAY OF. OF OUR

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.358
UNIVERSITY SYSTEM HAVING

00:34:54.425 --> 00:34:56.794
DIALOGUE- ON AN INTERNATIONAL

00:34:56.861 --> 00:34:58.996
BASIS REGARDLESS OF. OF

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.965
POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP OR OR

00:35:01.032 --> 00:35:03.267
OTHER ISSUES. OF ON AN ISSUE

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.184
GONNA SURVIVE. BUT THE QUESTION

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:20.952
IS WHETHER HUMANITY'S GONNA

00:35:21.018 --> 00:35:23.154
SURVIVE. AND I DON'T THINK WE

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:23.955

POLARIZATION AND I THINK THIS

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.528
IS A GREAT. EXAMPLE OF MOVING

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:31.162
