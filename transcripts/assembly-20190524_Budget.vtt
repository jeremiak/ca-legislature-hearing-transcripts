00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:10.868
REALLY DEEP AND GET BEYOND THE

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:13.103
THAT THE SURFACE TO TALK ABOUT.

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.705
WHAT OUR GOALS WERE WHAT HOW

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:16.373
THIS WAS PARTICULARLY UP

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:17.841
IMPACTING THAT AND WITHIN THAT

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.209
WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS?

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:20.577
THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:22.212
ON PUBLIC SAFETY HAS HAS MADE

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.014
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN TO

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.349
ENSURE IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:26.483
OUTCOMES.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.352
AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY OVER

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:29.720
PROGRAMS AND EXPENDITURES WE

00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:30.554
SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME

00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:31.688
TALKING ABOUT THE VARIOUS

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:32.956
PROGRAMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.424
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:35.792
AND WHETHER NOT THEY ACHIEVING

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.761
THE GOALS THAT WE SET AND BEING

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.163
VERY HONEST ABOUT WITHIN THAT WE

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:40.164
WERE ACTUALLY REDUCING

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:41.732
RECIDIVISM OR WHETHER PEOPLE

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.500
JUST COMPLYING WITH PROGRAMS

00:46:43.567 --> 00:46:44.601
WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE

00:46:44.668 --> 00:46:45.302
OUTCOME.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:45.769
SO WE HAVE VERY GOOD

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.838
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT IN VERY

00:46:47.905 --> 00:46:48.805
GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO

00:46:48.872 --> 00:46:51.208
USE A DOLLARS IN THE FUTURE.

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:53.977
BASICALLY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT --

00:46:54.044 --> 00:46:55.078
AMONG OUR MANY ACTIONS WE

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.513
APPROVE THE TRANSITION OF THE

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.182

00:47:00.384 --> 00:47:01.718
SERVICES AGENCY.

00:47:01.785 --> 00:47:04.388
AB AND THAT IN ITSELF WAS A A A

00:47:04.454 --> 00:47:05.656
QUITE A CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE OF

00:47:05.722 --> 00:47:06.757
THOUGHT AS A COMMITTEE THAT WE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.759
REALLY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:09.860
TO MAKE SUCH A MAJOR MOVE.

00:47:09.927 --> 00:47:11.161
AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:13.096
CREATED ADVISORY BODY TO ADDRESS

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.498

WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE

00:47:18.535 --> 00:47:19.870
TRANSITION BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

00:47:19.937 --> 00:47:20.671
SURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT.

00:47:20.737 --> 00:47:21.772
AND THAT WOULD JUST NOT MOVING

00:47:21.838 --> 00:47:23.040
FROM ONE BUILDING TO THE NEXT

00:47:23.106 --> 00:47:25.008

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:27.244
SAME RESULTS.

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:28.612
WE'VE ALSO MADE A CRITICAL

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:29.513
INVESTMENT TO ADDRESS THE HIGH

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:31.215
RATE OF DEATH OCCURRING FROM

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.883
DRUG OVERDOSES IN OUR PRISONS --

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:34.051
BUT WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO IT IN

00:47:34.117 --> 00:47:36.053
A MANNER THAT WE BELIEVE THAT

00:47:36.119 --> 00:47:37.221
WILL DELIVER THE BEST RESULTS.

00:47:37.287 --> 00:47:38.822
ADDRESSING THE FLOW OF DRUGS

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.290

IN THANKING EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:55.959
INVOLVED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:49:56.026 --> 00:49:56.560
THIS YEAR I REMAIN CONVINCED

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:57.194
THAT CRAFTING THE BUDGET IS THE

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:58.295
SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL THING

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.696
THAT THIS LEGISLATURE DOES EVERY

00:49:59.763 --> 00:50:00.097
YEAR.

00:50:00.163 --> 00:50:01.932
DISTRIBUTING THAT OVER TWO

00:50:01.998 --> 00:50:03.433

WE SERVE.

00:50:07.304 --> 00:50:08.839
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.407
COMMITTEE IS SO IMPORTANT IN THE

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:12.809
ASSEMBLY -- SO THANK YOU ALL FOR

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.378
YOUR HARD WORK ON THE BUDGET --

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:16.113
I THINK THAT FOR THE PEOPLE

00:50:16.179 --> 00:50:17.347
OUTSIDE THE BUDGET PROCESS THEY

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:19.015
DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH WORK IT

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:20.384
IS TO SERVE ON A BUDGET

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:22.018
SUBCOMMITTEE BUT IF YOU TAKE A

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.353
JOB SERIOUSLY AND I'M CONVINCED

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.989

THAT'S BEEN INVOLVED IN

00:50:32.195 --> 00:50:33.230
SUPPORTING THEM.

00:50:33.296 --> 00:50:34.231
I ALSO ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS

00:50:34.297 --> 00:50:35.866
IS THERE'S A LOT TO LIKE IN THE

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:37.067
ASSEMBLY BUDGET THIS YEAR.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:39.336
I I DON'T THINK IT'S AN

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:40.370
EXAGGERATION TO SAY IT IS A MUCH

00:50:40.437 --> 00:50:41.938
MORE FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET

00:50:42.005 --> 00:50:42.639
THAN THE ONE THAT'S EITHER

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:44.207
COMING OUT OF THE SENATE OR THE

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:44.808
ONE THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.610
GOVERNOR AND I THINK THOSE ARE --

00:50:46.676 --> 00:50:49.713
REALLY GREAT THINGS -- HOWEVER I

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.215
HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS.

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:53.784
AND ONE OF THE MOMENT TALK ABOUT

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.185
SOMETHING ELSE THAT I LIKE --

00:50:55.252 --> 00:50:56.219
THE THE GOVERNOR ISLA REALLY

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:58.688
WANT TO COMMEND THE ASSEMBLY FOR

00:50:58.755 --> 00:50:59.523
PUSHING BACK ON THE

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.958
ADMINISTRATION IN CHARACTERIZING

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:03.460
SOME OF THE EXPENDITURES AS ONE

00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:04.628
TIME.

00:51:04.694 --> 00:51:06.530
I THINK THE GOVERNOR TOLD US ALL

00:51:06.596 --> 00:51:08.765
THAT 11% OF THE SPENDING

00:51:08.832 --> 00:51:11.201
INCREASE WAS ONE TIME AND 89%

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:13.603
I'M SORRY WHAT ONLY 11% WAS --

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.807
ONGOING 89% WAS ONE TIME.

00:51:16.873 --> 00:51:17.574
AND I THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS AN

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:18.675
UNFAIR CHARACTERIZATION BECAUSE

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.143
WHEN YOU PUT A SUNSET ON

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.478
SOMETHING LIKE ON AYE HSS

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.546
PROVIDER.

00:51:22.612 --> 00:51:24.681
RATE INCREASE OR A TEST SALES

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.349
TAX EXEMPTION FOR DIAPERS AND

00:51:26.416 --> 00:51:27.584
TAMPONS WE KNOW THAT THOSE

00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:29.052
THINGS ARE GOING TO BE ROLLED

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.854
BACK IN FUTURE YEARS SO. TO SAY

00:51:30.921 --> 00:51:32.355
THAT THAT'S ONE TIME EXPENDITURE

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:33.990
IS -- IS I THINK NOT REALLY

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.492
CHARACTERIZING IT RIGHT AND TO

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:36.493
THE FOR THE MOST PART THIS BODY

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.495
WHEN WE CRAFT OUR BUDGET HAS

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:39.563
RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO DO

00:51:39.629 --> 00:51:39.996
THAT.

00:51:40.063 --> 00:51:41.865
AND I REALLY THINK THAT THAT'S A

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:42.732
GREAT THING.

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.968
ALSO I AM VERY THANKFUL THAT WE

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.403
ARE TAKING THE THREAT OF

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:48.004
RECESSION AND ITS CONSEQUENT

00:51:48.071 --> 00:51:49.139
IMPACT ON STATE REVENUE

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:51.641
SERIOUSLY IN THIS BUDGET WE

00:51:51.708 --> 00:51:53.076
CONTINUE TO MAKE PRUDENT

00:51:53.143 --> 00:51:54.778
VESTMENTS AND OUR STATE RESERVES --

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.113
IF DEPENDING ON HOW THE DUST

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:58.582
SETTLES I THINK WE'RE GONNA WIND

00:51:58.648 --> 00:51:59.749
UP AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL

00:51:59.816 --> 00:52:01.518
YEAR WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:02.185
TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:02.886
RESERVE.

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:03.787
WHICH WILL BE THE LARGEST

00:52:03.854 --> 00:52:05.155
RESERVE IN CALIFORNIA STATE

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:05.789
HISTORY.

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:07.123
THOSE ARE GREAT THINGS HOWEVER I

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.859
ALSOTHINK WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:11.061
THAT THE LA -- TELLS US THAT

00:52:11.127 --> 00:52:12.362
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IN A MODEST

00:52:12.429 --> 00:52:13.797
RECESSION ABOUT SEVENTY BILLION

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:16.233
DOLLARS OF OVERALL REVENUE LOSS.

00:52:16.299 --> 00:52:17.367
AND EVEN WHEN YOU BALANCE OUT

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.035
THINGS LIKE THE DECLINING IN THE

00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:20.070
PROP NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEES

00:52:20.136 --> 00:52:21.605
THAT STILL GOING TO HAVE AN OVER

00:52:21.671 --> 00:52:23.640
FORTY BILLION DOLLAR IMPACT ON

00:52:23.707 --> 00:52:26.343
OUR BUDGET SO. TO PUT THAT IN

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.178
CONTEXT WE ARE ABOUT IF IF OUR

00:52:28.245 --> 00:52:30.480
GOAL IS TO HAVE ENOUGH REVENUE

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:31.915
TO WHETHER A MODEST RECESSION

00:52:31.982 --> 00:52:33.583
WITHOUT CUTTING PROGRAMS WE'RE

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.851
ABOUT HALFWAY THERE.

00:52:34.918 --> 00:52:36.119
SO -- IT'S GREAT THAT WE'RE ON

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:40.991
THIS PATH AND I WANT TO CONTINUE

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:41.758
TO TO DO THAT.

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:42.392
I ALSO WANT TO TALK AGAIN AS I

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:43.393
HAVE IN THE PAST ABOUT THE WAY

00:52:43.460 --> 00:52:43.894
THAT THOSE RESERVES ARE

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.427
STRUCTURED.

00:52:44.494 --> 00:52:45.529
THE THE JUST A FEW SHORT YEARS

00:52:45.595 --> 00:52:46.863
AGO WE ONLY HAD A SINGLE STATE

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:48.598
RESERVE FUND THE SPECIAL FUND

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:50.267
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES.

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:51.067
AND THERE IS A PROVISION IN

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:53.303
STATE LAW THE SAYS THAT WHEN THE

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.304
BALANCE IN THE SFE YOU GETS

00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:55.739
ABOVE 3% OF GENERAL FUND

00:52:55.805 --> 00:52:56.940
REVENUES.

00:52:57.007 --> 00:52:58.341
STATE SALES TAXES OPPOSED TO GO

00:52:58.408 --> 00:52:59.843
DOWN ONE QUARTER OF A PERCENTAGE

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:00.777
POINT.

00:53:00.844 --> 00:53:02.245
AND THAT'S SUPPOSED TO GIVE THE

00:53:02.312 --> 00:53:04.281
TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA A BREAK

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:06.016
ON SALES TAX IN YEARS WHEN.

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:08.018
THE STATE HAS A LOT OF REVENUE

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:10.420
AND I WE'VE CREATED LOTS OF

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:11.755
DIFFERENT RESERVES NOW THE

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.390
RESERVES ARE SOCIAL SAFETY NETS

00:53:13.456 --> 00:53:15.926
RESERVE CREATED BY THE VOTERS.

00:53:15.992 --> 00:53:16.693
BUT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT HAS

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.295
BEEN THAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA

00:53:18.361 --> 00:53:19.396
HAVE NOT SEEN THAT SALES TAX

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:22.632
RIGHT RATE CUT AND I REALLY

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:24.134
STRONGLY THINK THAT THEY SHOULD --

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:25.201
I JUST WANNA TAKE ONE MINUTE TO

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.803
TALK ABOUT EDUCATION FUNDING

00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:28.572
BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:30.307
I'VE BEEN VERY FRUSTRATED ABOUT.

00:53:30.373 --> 00:53:32.409
THIS BUDGET FUNDS A MODEST

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:35.879
INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA K.

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:37.514
TWELVE EDUCATION SPENDING IT'LL

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:39.049
BE ABOUT.

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:39.616
TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

00:53:39.683 --> 00:53:40.784
STUDENT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:44.688
THAT WHEN -- THIS BUDGET PASSES.

00:53:44.754 --> 00:53:46.323
TO PUT IN CONTEXT THAT'S FORTY

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.024
FIRST IN THE NATION EVEN WITH

00:53:48.091 --> 00:53:49.125
THAT INCREASE.

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:51.661
AND THE CONSEQUENCE OF HAVING.

00:53:51.728 --> 00:53:52.963
K. TWELVE EDUCATION FUNDED AT

00:53:53.029 --> 00:53:55.365
THAT LOW LEVEL ARE MANIFOLD WE

00:53:55.432 --> 00:53:56.933
ARE FORTY SIX THE AND READING

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.201
TEST SCORES WERE FORTY SEVENTH

00:53:58.268 --> 00:53:59.803
AND MATH WE HAVE THE LOWEST.

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:01.571
STUDENT TO TEACHER RATIO THE

00:54:01.638 --> 00:54:02.772
ENTIRE COUNTRY.

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:04.608
AND THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE AND I

00:54:04.674 --> 00:54:06.009
KNOW THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:07.077
ISSUE I KNOW EVERYONE AGREES

00:54:07.143 --> 00:54:08.912
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE -- WE HAVE

00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:11.615
A BILL IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT --

00:54:11.681 --> 00:54:12.682
MISTER CARTY AND I AM MISTER

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:13.516
MERCHANTS YEAR OLD JOIN AUTHOR

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.151
OF ITS A. B. THIRTY NINE THAT

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:16.219
STATES THE INTENT OF THE

00:54:16.286 --> 00:54:17.554
LEGISLATURE TO RAISE THAT.

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:19.089
PER STUDENT SPENDING RATIO UP TO

00:54:19.155 --> 00:54:20.857
AT LEAST.

00:54:20.924 --> 00:54:21.458
THE MIDDLE OF THE AVERAGE FOR

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:22.092
STATES.

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:24.060
BUT THAT IS NEVER GOING TO GET

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:25.295
DONE AND LESS WE HAVE THE

00:54:25.362 --> 00:54:28.732
POLITICAL WILL TO DO IT AND

00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.333
EVERY TIME THAT WE FIND ANOTHER

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.167
PROGRAM.

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.736
AND IT'S VERY SEDUCTIVE WHEN WE

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:33.903
TALK ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:35.238
EDUCATION WE TALK BOUT SCHOOL

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.673
BREAKFAST WE TALK ABOUT AFTER

00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.074
SCHOOL PROGRAMS BUT EVERY TIME

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:38.975
WE FIND ONE OF THOSE PROGRAMS

00:54:39.042 --> 00:54:40.410
THAT WE TAKE AWAY DOLLARS THAT

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:41.277
WE COULD HAVE SPENT.

00:54:41.344 --> 00:54:42.779
TOWARDS MEETING THE PRIMARY

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.414
COMMITMENT THAT WE HAVE TO

00:54:44.481 --> 00:54:46.149
CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SO THAT'S

00:54:46.216 --> 00:54:47.217
SOMETHING THAT I REMAIN VERY

00:54:47.283 --> 00:54:48.918
FRUSTRATED ABOUT AND I'M HOPEFUL

00:54:48.985 --> 00:54:50.320
IN FUTURE YEARS THAT WE CAN TAKE

00:54:50.387 --> 00:54:51.855
STEPS TOWARDS.

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.456
REMAINING THAT SITUATION SO --

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.125
THIS BILL THIS BUDGET OBVIOUSLY

00:54:55.191 --> 00:54:56.793
HAS SOME GOOD PARTS AND SO BAD

00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.094
PARTS -- I WILL BE OF STANDING

00:54:58.161 --> 00:54:59.462
ON THE VOTE IN THE HOPES THAT WE

00:54:59.529 --> 00:55:00.864
CAN WORK OUT SOME OF THE THINGS

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.332
THAT I HAVE OBJECTIONS TO IN THE

00:55:02.399 --> 00:55:03.533
CONFERENCE COMMITTEE PROCESS BUT

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.668
MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY

00:55:04.734 --> 00:55:06.903
MUCH. FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THE

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.172
BUDGET AND FOR ALL OF THE

00:55:09.239 --> 00:55:12.542
BUDGETS SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF THAT

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.077
WE SERVE WITH.

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.412
THANK YOU MISTER FOSTER I THINK

00:55:15.478 --> 00:55:17.080
IT'S A REMINDER THAT THE OVERALL

00:55:17.147 --> 00:55:18.415
WITHIN THE BUDGET THERE'S A MOST

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:20.383
OF IT WE AGREE ON AND THE LARGE

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.384
MAJORITY THAT WE AGREE ON

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.619
OBVIOUSLY THERE'S STILL.

00:55:22.686 --> 00:55:23.987
SOME DIFFERENCES AS YOU AS

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:26.222
HIGHLIGHTED -- TO IRON OUT THAT

00:55:26.289 --> 00:55:27.524
BUT AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.392
OF THE THREE BY JUST THIS IS THE

00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:31.628
MOST FISCALLY PRUDENT BUDGET --

00:55:31.695 --> 00:55:33.229
AND IT'S ALSO THE BUDGET THAT

00:55:33.296 --> 00:55:34.864
AGAIN HAS PRIORITIZE EDUCATION

00:55:34.931 --> 00:55:35.665
THE MOST.

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.767
AT THE SAME TIME IS REALLY

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.135
PREPARING US FOR THE FUTURE.

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:43.973
WITHOUT I KNOW DOCTOR WOULD HAVE

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:44.541
TO QUESTION AND THEN MISTER

00:55:44.607 --> 00:55:45.608
COOPER.

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:46.710
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER

00:55:46.776 --> 00:55:47.377
CHAIR AND I AND MY QUESTION WAS

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:48.011
AND I ACTUALLY YOU WERE ABLE TO

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:48.611
POINT OUT TO ME AND THAT WAS

00:55:48.678 --> 00:55:51.381
REGARDING THE IN CO TAX

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.416
EXTENSION -- I KNOW I'VE SPOKEN

00:55:53.483 --> 00:55:55.218
ABOUT THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND I'M

00:55:55.285 --> 00:55:57.120
GLAD TO SEE THAT IT'S ON PAGE

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.322
SIX OF OF OF OF THE OVER HERE.

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.590
I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ONCE

00:56:00.657 --> 00:56:03.526
AGAIN -- POINT OUT THAT -- BY

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.829
NOT PURSUING THE EXTENSION WE AS

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:07.063
THE ELLIE ALWAYS PUT IT -- IT

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:08.965
HAS THE EFFECT OF LEAVING MONEY

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:11.000
ON THE TABLE I FEDERAL MONEY ON

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:13.336
THE TABLE AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER

00:56:13.403 --> 00:56:15.305
THE NUMBER PROGRAMS -- ALTHOUGH

00:56:15.371 --> 00:56:18.074
OUR BUDGET -- IS IS DOING.

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:19.876
MORE INVESTMENT IN IN TRYING TO

00:56:19.943 --> 00:56:21.511
BRING PROGRAMS BACK -- TO PRE

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:23.780
RECESSION LEVELS -- BY LEAVING

00:56:23.847 --> 00:56:25.682
FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE --

00:56:25.749 --> 00:56:27.450
IT'S IT'S IT LIMITS THAT ABILITY

00:56:27.517 --> 00:56:28.885
TO DO THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:56:28.952 --> 00:56:30.320
PROGRAMS AND WE SIT THROUGH

00:56:30.386 --> 00:56:32.155
HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF

00:56:32.222 --> 00:56:34.357
TESTIMONY FROM REALLY GREAT

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.092
ABOUT REALLY GREAT PROGRAMS.

00:56:36.159 --> 00:56:38.228
THAT SERVE OUR SENIOR POPULATION

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.863

WE KNOW IT'S HERE WHAT IS THE

01:05:38.034 --> 01:05:41.170
PLAN TO BACK FILL THIS ONE POINT

TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE -- TO

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.878
GOING TO SOME DETAILS OF THE

01:05:48.944 --> 01:05:49.979
FIRST IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S NAY

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:51.947
REVISION -- IN RESPONSE TO THE

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:53.883
RATE STUDY INCLUDES A HUNDRED

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:55.551
MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.320
THE BUDGET YEAR AND AND TWO

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.721
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:05:58.788 --> 01:05:59.789
YEAR AFTER THAT SO WE'RE SEEING

01:05:59.855 --> 01:06:00.456
THIS.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:02.825
AS A PHASED IN PROCESS YOU KNOW

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:04.527
WE FIGURE WITH A SYSTEM THIS

01:06:04.593 --> 01:06:05.828
COMPLICATED AND SERVING THIS

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.730
MANY PEOPLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:08.798
THAT WE DO THINGS IN THE RIGHT

01:06:08.864 --> 01:06:09.398
WAY.

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:10.900
AND SPECIFICALLY THIS INCREASE

01:06:10.966 --> 01:06:12.435
IN THE BUDGET YEAR IS FOCUSED ON

01:06:12.501 --> 01:06:13.969
A NUMBER OF CORE PRIORITIES

01:06:14.036 --> 01:06:16.472
MAKING SURE THAT WE STABILIZE

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:17.773
THE RESIDENTIAL POPULATION.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.708
MAKING SURE THAT WE ENSURE

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:20.242
SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.244
PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM AND

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:23.079
MAKING SURE WE ADDRESS

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:24.447
DISPARITIES IN RATES BETWEEN

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:26.282
VENDORS AND CENTERS ACROSS THE

01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:28.951
SYSTEM -- AND AND AS MENTIONED

01:06:29.018 --> 01:06:30.886
IN THE MULTI YEAR FORECAST THAT

01:06:30.953 --> 01:06:36.058
RATE RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:37.660
REFORMS IN THE SYSTEM AS IN MANY

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.161
OF OTHER OTHER HEALTHCARE

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:39.995
SYSTEMS.

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:42.031
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT

01:06:42.098 --> 01:06:43.332
THERE'S SOME STRUCTURAL PRESSURE

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:44.700
ON THE GENERAL FUND IN OUR MAY

01:06:44.767 --> 01:06:46.235
REVISION COMPARED TO WHAT WE SAW

01:06:46.302 --> 01:06:48.170
IN JANUARY -- AND THAT'S THE

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.139
REASON THAT THESE RATE INCREASES

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:51.374
OUR SON SIDE.

01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.275
IN THE NAY REVISION -- PURSUANT

01:06:53.342 --> 01:06:55.244
TO THOSE PRESSURES BUT THE

01:06:55.311 --> 01:06:56.679
BROADEST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.481
WE SEE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:06:58.547 --> 01:06:59.148
HAS TO BE ADDRESSED OVER SEVERAL

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.783
YEARS WE'RE COMMITTED TO THOSE

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.151
REFORM EFFORTS AND WE WANT TO

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:04.520
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:05.688
YOU ON HOW TO DO THAT.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.123
SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT NOT

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:09.392
RECOGNIZING AND AGAIN THE

01:07:09.458 --> 01:07:10.559
SUNSETS I CAN SEE.

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:12.528
THE INTENT BUT THE POPULATION

01:07:12.595 --> 01:07:14.864
CONTINUES TO GROW AND ABOUT 10%.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:16.298
A YEAR.

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:19.535
AND SO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED AND

01:07:19.602 --> 01:07:20.169
THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:20.936
THE SYSTEM NOW.

01:07:21.003 --> 01:07:23.506
EACH YEAR THIRTY THREE THOUSAND

01:07:23.572 --> 01:07:24.407
MORE [inaudible]

01:07:24.473 --> 01:07:26.242
OKAY SO.

01:07:26.308 --> 01:07:27.743
NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WHAT

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:28.978
WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOW WE'RE

01:07:29.044 --> 01:07:30.780
FUNDING LESS EVERY YEAR IF WE

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:34.316
DON'T EVEN STAY TO THE THE 10%

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:35.918
MORE POPULATION.

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:37.586
INCREASES.

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.522
A ONE OF THE THINGS ALSO.

01:07:39.588 --> 01:07:40.823
WE'RE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING IS A THE

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.925
THE SERVICE COORDINATOR OF

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.728
POPULATION IS ABSOLUTELY.

01:07:45.795 --> 01:07:50.633
CRIMINAL HOW A HUNDRED I DE.

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.768
INDIVIDUALS ARE SERVICE BY ONE

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:54.170
SERVICE COORDINATOR IN SOME

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.504
REGIONAL CENTERS.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:56.405
THE OTHER IS THE LACK OF

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.441
PROVIDERS FOR THE POPULATION THE

01:07:58.507 --> 01:07:59.275
WAITING LIST THAT THESE

01:07:59.341 --> 01:08:00.509
INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO WAIT

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.611
SOMETIMES ONE TO TWO YEARS TO

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:05.514
EVEN GET A DIRECT SERVICE

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:05.781
PROVIDER.

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:06.715
IF AT ALL.

01:08:06.782 --> 01:08:09.819
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE AN EFFORT.

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.021
TO CREATE A CAREER PATH.

01:08:12.087 --> 01:08:13.923
NUMBER ONE OR SOME KIND OF

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.124
CERTIFICATE LEVEL.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:17.059
IT WAS MAKE MORE THAN.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:18.861
LIVING ARE MORE THAN MINIMUM

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:20.296
WAGE.

01:08:20.362 --> 01:08:22.164
AND INCENTIVIZE BECAUSE THERE'S

01:08:22.231 --> 01:08:23.432
NO REASON FOR PROVIDERS EVEN

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:25.334
THINK THAT THEY WANT TO HELP

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:28.103
THIS POPULATION IT'S OUR SUNSETS.

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.872
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.974
INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS TO COME IN

01:08:32.041 --> 01:08:34.610
THERE IS A HUGE DESPERATE NEED

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.011
FOR PROVIDERS WE HAVE ENOUGH

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.447
PROFESSIONALS FOR ASSESSMENT.

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:39.782
WE DO REAL WELL AT THAT.

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.117
BUT WE DO NOT GET THE PEOPLE ON

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:43.953
THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THERE

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.855
ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE SERVICE.

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:46.589
FOR THE WELL BEING OF THIS

01:08:46.655 --> 01:08:48.724
POPULATION I REALLY WOULD STRESS

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:52.294
SO WE WORK TOGETHER. TO LOOK FOR

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:53.963
AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:56.298
THAT GOES FORWARD THAT'S BEEN

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:58.134
IGNORED FOR A LONG TIME.

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.001
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.536
SERVICE.

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:03.372
THESE PEOPLE THE OF THE CARE

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:04.840

THE STATE -- IN TERMS OF THE TWO

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:44.847
BIG BIGGEST COST PRESSURES

FUN IN THERE -- BUT I DO HAVE --

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:23.191
A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT I'M

01:19:23.258 --> 01:19:24.759
OPEN -- THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:28.663
ABLE TO ANSWER -- YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:31.299
DONE A LOT TO INCREASE HEALTH

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:34.302
CARE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS.

01:19:34.369 --> 01:19:36.905
AND AS WE GO FORWARD AND DO THIS

01:19:36.972 --> 01:19:38.807
MY LARGEST CONCERN IS I I REALLY

01:19:38.874 --> 01:19:40.108
HONESTLY DON'T THINK WE PUT

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.777
ENOUGH AND ON THE PROVIDER SIDE.

01:19:42.844 --> 01:19:45.413
SO ON ONE HAND WE ARE INCREASING

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:48.283
THE FLOCKS THAT'S GOING TO GO

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:49.384
INTO OUR MEDIC HEALTH SYSTEM.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.853
IN VASTLY INCREASING THE NUMBER

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.522
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO GO

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:54.823
ON TO THE SYSTEM.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.993
BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ANOTHER OFF.

01:19:58.059 --> 01:19:59.694
NEARLY ENOUGH TO INCREASE

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:03.265
PROVIDERS. FOR THAT SYSTEM.

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.733
A I KNOW WE'VE HELPED A LITTLE

01:20:04.799 --> 01:20:06.301
BIT WITH HOW MUCH THEY'RE

01:20:06.368 --> 01:20:07.669
THEY'RE GONNA GET BACK IN AND

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:09.171
HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK.

01:20:09.237 --> 01:20:10.939
BUT AS FAR AS GETTING MORE

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.440
PROVIDERS.

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:13.909
OUT THERE.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.143
A AND I'M TALKING MORE DOCTORS

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.612
MORE NURSES IN IN DOING THESE

01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:18.914
THINGS WE HAVEN'T.

01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:21.550
ON ANYTHING VERY SUBSTANTIVE.

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:23.218
AND I HAVE A FAST CONCERNED THAT

01:20:23.285 --> 01:20:24.786
WE'RE GOING TO FLOOD THE MARKET

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:26.788
AND WE ALREADY HAVE ISSUES WHERE.

01:20:26.855 --> 01:20:28.490
WHEN FAMILIES GO TO SEE THEIR

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.492
PRIMARY CARE?

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.661
THEY'RE ALREADY WAITING WEEKS.

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:33.762
AND NOW I HAVE CONCERNS IT'S

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:34.930
GONNA BE MONTHS.

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:38.867
SO SO I HAVE A QUESTION ON THAT --

01:20:38.934 --> 01:20:40.302
THEY IN THAT I HAVE -- OTHER

01:20:40.368 --> 01:20:41.570
QUESTIONS REGARDING AND IN

01:20:41.636 --> 01:20:42.871
HOMELESS SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:44.906
ANSWER THAT ONE AND THEN WE CAN

01:20:44.973 --> 01:20:46.908
GO TO THE NEXT.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:48.810
SO I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY AND THEN

01:20:48.877 --> 01:20:49.711
TURNED OVER TO ADAM DORSEY MY

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:51.813
COLLEAGUE SO THE FIRST POINT I

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.248
WANT TO MAKE IS WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:20:53.315 --> 01:20:54.316
ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE ARE

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.684
MORE DEMANDS ON OUR HEALTH CARE

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.652
SYSTEM -- UNDER THE AFFORDABLE

01:20:57.719 --> 01:20:59.454
CARE ACT -- WE ADDED MORE THAN

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.022
THREE MILLION PEOPLE TO MEDI CAL

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.091
PROGRAMS AND OVER A MILLION

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.960
PEOPLE TO COVER CALIFORNIA SO WE

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:06.728
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE MORE

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.430
PEOPLE TAKING PART THE INSURANCE.

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:10.432
MARKET -- I DO BELIEVE THAT IN

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:11.600
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND NAY

01:21:11.666 --> 01:21:12.767
REVISION THERE ARE SOME

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.069
SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN

01:21:14.135 --> 01:21:15.503
ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE EVEN IF WE

01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.871
KNOW THAT WE ALL HAVE MORE TO DO

01:21:16.938 --> 01:21:18.840
IN THE YEARS. TO COME -- THE

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:21.443
FIRST IS UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY

01:21:21.509 --> 01:21:23.311
SIX MAKING SURE THAT WE DEVOTE

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:25.046
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:21:25.113 --> 01:21:26.114
TO INCREASING PROVIDER RATE

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:28.049
SYSTEMATIC CAL TO MAKING SURE

01:21:28.116 --> 01:21:28.650
THAT.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.852
MORE PROVIDERS ARE SERVING MEDI

01:21:30.919 --> 01:21:32.454
CAL PATIENTS WE WERE DOING A

01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:33.688
LITTLE BIT THERE BUT AS AS

01:21:33.755 --> 01:21:35.056
YOU'VE HEARD FROM TWO OF MY

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.558
COLLEAGUES ALREADY DOCTOR WITH

THE MISTER FRAZIER.

01:21:37.726 --> 01:21:40.128
YOU'RE LEAVING A LOT OF THAT MCO

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:43.131
FUNDING.

01:21:43.198 --> 01:21:44.499
STILL ON THE TABLE.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.133
THAT WE COULD BE ACCESSING THE

01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:45.967
INCREASE PROVIDERS [inaudible]

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.869
IN.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:49.204
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE THAT'S

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.506
GOING TO INCREASE THE NEED TO

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.809
GET MORE DOCTORS.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.845
SO I MEAN IT'S GREAT THAT YOU

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.014

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.515

INCREASE THE ABILITY.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.586
FOR GRADUATION RATES FOR DOCTORS

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:07.055
AND NURSES YES SO -- THE SECOND

01:22:07.122 --> 01:22:08.623
THE THE SEVEN POINT ONE NINETEEN

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:10.792
IS THAT ALSO UNDER PROPOSITION

01:22:10.859 --> 01:22:11.660
FIFTY SIX WE'RE DEVOTING

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:12.861
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:22:12.927 --> 01:22:14.229
FOR LOAN REPAYMENTS FOR THOSE

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.964
DOCTORS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON

01:22:16.031 --> 01:22:17.232
THOSE DOCTORS THAT WILL SERVE

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.434
MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE PATIENTS SO.

01:22:19.501 --> 01:22:20.735
WE HAD A LOT OF MONEY THERE IN

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:22.304
JANUARY WE PUT AN EVEN MORE

01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:23.705
MONEY IN THE NAY REVISIONS SO

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.540
THAT IS A PRIORITY FOR HOW THE

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.509
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.177
SPEND PROPOSITION.

01:22:29.244 --> 01:22:30.078
FIFTY SIX MONEY -- AND THEN ONE

01:22:30.145 --> 01:22:31.646
OTHER POINT AND I KNOW ADAM MAY

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:33.048
WANT TO WEIGH IN AS WELL IS

01:22:33.114 --> 01:22:34.683
SPECIFICALLY ON MENTAL HEALTH

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:35.884
BECAUSE WE KNOW THERE THERE'S A

01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.719
SPECIAL WORK FORCE NEED -- THE

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.220
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD FIFTY

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:40.822
MILLION DOLLARS AND THEN IN THE

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.524
NAY REVISION WE'RE PROPOSING AN

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.992
EXTRA HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:22:44.059 --> 01:22:45.093
UNDER THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.828
ACTIVE FUNDING. TO MAKE SURE

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.663
THAT WE ATTRACT MORE PROVIDERS

01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:49.964
TO THE MENTAL HEALTH FIELD SO

01:22:50.031 --> 01:22:52.067
THAT IS A SPECIFIC AREA OF FOCUS

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.401
WE KNOW IT'S NOT A PROBLEM THAT

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:54.703
WE CAN SOLVE IN ONE YEAR BUT WE

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:55.970
DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BUDGET

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:58.707
REFLECTS AN EMPHASIS ON THAT

01:22:58.773 --> 01:23:00.642
PRIORITY.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:01.910
WELL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.044
WITH YOU GUYS ON THAT AS WE MOVE

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:05.580
FORWARD -- MY OTHER QUESTION. TO

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:06.514
YOU IS IN REGARD TO THE

01:23:06.581 --> 01:23:07.949
HOMELESSNESS THERE'S A LOT OF

01:23:08.016 --> 01:23:09.551
MONEY FOR HOMELESSNESS HOUSING.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.852
AND MONEY GOING BACK INTO THE

01:23:10.919 --> 01:23:12.887
COMMUNITIES BUT THERE'S NOT A

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:13.955
LOT OF MONEY REALLY ADDRESSING

01:23:14.022 --> 01:23:14.856
THE TRUE PROBLEM WITH

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:16.191
HOMELESSNESS AND THAT'S DOING

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:19.094
THE TRANSITIONAL PROGRAMS. TO

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.429
HELP OUR HOMELESS POPULATION

01:23:21.496 --> 01:23:24.065
TRANSITION BACK INTO LIVING IN

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:25.467
HOMES.

01:23:25.533 --> 01:23:27.635
AND TRANSITION BACK INTO BEING

01:23:27.702 --> 01:23:28.937
UP TO GET JOBS AND DO THAT.

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:32.841
SO I REALLY INTERESTED -- INTO

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:34.275
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS IN

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:36.644
REGARDS TO TRANSITIONING ARE

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.480
HOMELESS POPULATION BACK INTO

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:39.781
SOCIETY.

01:23:39.848 --> 01:23:41.616
IT'S A TOPIC THAT WE TALKED

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.852
ABOUT WITHIN SOMEONE -- BUT

01:23:43.918 --> 01:23:45.420
DIDN'T GET ANY TRUE CLEAR

01:23:45.487 --> 01:23:47.355
ANSWERS ON WHAT TYPES OF

01:23:47.422 --> 01:23:48.723
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.293
FIND OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.428
GOING TO PUT INTO TRANSITIONING --

01:23:53.495 --> 01:23:54.496
IN THAT'S REALLY GOING TO BE THE

01:23:54.562 --> 01:23:55.864
PROBLEM BECAUSE WE CAN WE CAN

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.165
TAKE SOMEBODY WAS HOMELESS AND

01:23:57.232 --> 01:23:58.666
PUT ON A HOME PLATE ALL THE

01:23:58.733 --> 01:23:59.901
STUDIES SHOW THAT THE END UP

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.102
LIVING IN TENTS.

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:02.470
AND IT ESSENTIALLY DESTROYING

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:03.738
THE APARTMENTS THEY GET PUT INTO

01:24:03.805 --> 01:24:05.206
BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST NOT READY

01:24:05.273 --> 01:24:06.141
FOR IT YET.

01:24:06.207 --> 01:24:07.642
AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO ENSURE

01:24:07.709 --> 01:24:09.077
THAT THERE'S FUNDING GOING TO

01:24:09.144 --> 01:24:11.179
HELP THEM TRANSITION OVER.

01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.581
I FOR GOING TO TRULY HELP THAT

01:24:13.648 --> 01:24:14.949
POPULATION.

01:24:15.016 --> 01:24:16.217
I THINK THAT'S IT PERSPECTIVE

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.285
THE ADMINISTRATION REALLY DOES

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:18.953
APPRECIATE AND I JUST WANT TO

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:19.988
MENTION TWO POINTS IN THE

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:21.156
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION BUT I

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:22.490
THINK ADDRESSES SOME OF THOSE

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:23.324
POINTS.

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.526
THE FIRST IS THAT ARE

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.628
HOMELESSNESS POPULATION -- I'M

01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.563
SORRY HOMELESSNESS PROPOSAL A

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:29.864
LOT OF THE TENSION CAME TO THE

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:31.699
OVERALL INCREASE TO SIX HUNDRED

01:24:31.766 --> 01:24:32.467
FIFTY KNOWING WHICH I KNOW

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.068
MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY OF ALSO.

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:35.870
EMBRACE THAT FIGURE BUT WE ALSO

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.272
MADE SOME CHANGES IN TERMS OF

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:39.207
THE PROGRAM DESIGN ITSELF AND I

01:24:39.274 --> 01:24:39.707
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TO IN

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:40.508
PARTICULAR.

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.076
FIRST IS THAT WE EXPANDED THE

01:24:42.143 --> 01:24:43.912
FLEXIBILITY OF THE FUNDING THAT

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.246
WE ARE GIVING -- TO LOCAL

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.415
JURISDICTIONS -- BEFORE THERE

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:49.083
WAS A REAL FOCUS ON SHELTERS AND

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.585
NAVIGATION CENTERS AND WE

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.753
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS

01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:52.821
VERY IMPORTANT.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:53.988
BUT TO YOUR POINT WE ALSO

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:55.857
RECOGNIZE THAT MAKING SURE THAT

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.592
PEOPLE CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.760
IS DIFFERENT FOR EACH PERSON IT

01:24:58.827 --> 01:24:59.794
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT

01:24:59.861 --> 01:25:01.029
PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.664
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY ALTHOUGH THE

01:25:02.730 --> 01:25:04.065
GOVERNOR DOES WANT TO PROVIDE

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:04.933
STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP ON THIS

01:25:04.999 --> 01:25:06.301
ISSUE THROUGH HIS RECENTLY

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:07.735
ANNOUNCED TASK FORCE FOR THE

01:25:07.802 --> 01:25:08.269
COORDINATING AND FINANCING

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:10.104
COUNCIL WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

01:25:10.171 --> 01:25:11.806
SURE THAT LOCAL DECISION MAKERS

01:25:11.873 --> 01:25:12.106
HAVE THAT.

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:13.641
FLEXIBILITY AND THEN THE SECOND

01:25:13.708 --> 01:25:15.043
THING WE DID IN OUR BUDGET AND

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:16.277
WE RECOGNIZE THIS MIGHT BE AN

01:25:16.344 --> 01:25:17.479
ISSUE FOR CONFERENCE.

01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.113
IS THAT WE ALSO GAVE FUNDING NOT

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.315
ONLY TO CITIES AND CONVENIENCE

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:21.583
OF CARE BUT TO COUNTIES AS WELL

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.685
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SERVICES

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:24.686
THAT ARE PROVIDED ON THE LOCAL

01:25:24.752 --> 01:25:25.954
LEVEL THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:26.754
THAT TRANSITION.

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.890
ARE PROVIDED THROUGH COUNTIES

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.258
THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO

01:25:30.325 --> 01:25:31.759
MAKE IS ON HOLD PERSON CARE

01:25:31.826 --> 01:25:33.595
PILOTS AND THESE ARE REALLY

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.896
PROGRAMS THAT AFFECT

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:36.464
HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH

01:25:36.531 --> 01:25:38.833
ISSUES ACCESS TO SERVICES AND

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:39.968
JOB TRAINING AND EVERYTHING

01:25:40.034 --> 01:25:41.002
TOGETHER.

01:25:41.069 --> 01:25:42.170
WE HAD A ONE HUNDRED MILLION

01:25:42.237 --> 01:25:43.304
DOLLARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:25:43.371 --> 01:25:44.973
AND WE ADDED ANOTHER TWENTY

01:25:45.039 --> 01:25:46.341
MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS NAY

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:47.942
REVISION BECAUSE WE THINK YOU

01:25:48.009 --> 01:25:49.277
REALLY DO NEED TO ADDRESS THE

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:52.580
WHOLE PERSON TO GET AT THESE

01:25:52.647 --> 01:25:53.147
ISSUES THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:54.148
ABOUT.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:55.917
OKAY AND WITH THAT I KNOW SOME

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.118
OF THAT IS GOING A AS YOU SAID --

01:25:57.185 --> 01:25:58.419
BREAKING IT DOWN IS SPLIT INTO

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.922
WITH THE COUNTIES -- I DO HAVE

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.123
CONCERN ON HOW THAT SPLITS

01:26:02.190 --> 01:26:03.925
TAKING PLACE BECAUSE IT'S PUT IN

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.660
OUR ROLE COUNTIES IN JEOPARDY IN

01:26:05.727 --> 01:26:06.995
MAKING THEM COMPETE FOR SOME OF

01:26:07.061 --> 01:26:09.397
THOSE FUNDS -- AND I HELD DURING

01:26:09.464 --> 01:26:11.599
THE MAY REVISION PROCESS YOU ALL

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:14.002
CAN LOOK AT HOW TO SPLIT THAT --

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:15.904
IN A FAIR WAY AMONGST THEM THAT

01:26:15.970 --> 01:26:17.005
WAY THEY DON'T WANT TO COMPETE

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:20.108
FOR THOSE FUNDS -- THE BIG

01:26:20.174 --> 01:26:21.242
THIRTEEN AS THEY'RE CALLED DON'T

01:26:21.309 --> 01:26:22.343
HAVE TO COMPETE IT THEY GET IT

01:26:22.410 --> 01:26:24.045
UP FRONT WHICH HELPS THEM AND

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.480
PUT THEM STEPS AHEAD.

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:27.348
BUT OUR ROLE COUNTY IS -- ONLY

01:26:27.415 --> 01:26:29.717
GET A PIECE OF THE PIE AND THEN

01:26:29.784 --> 01:26:31.553
THEY GOT A FIGHT OVER THE REST.

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:32.120
AND THAT DOESN'T REALLY HELP

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:34.055
THEM OUT IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM

01:26:34.122 --> 01:26:35.223
ON THE PLANNING SIDE.

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:36.424
SO WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT

01:26:36.491 --> 01:26:38.960
MISTER CHAIR -- AS WE GET TO

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.028
CONFERENCE.

01:26:40.094 --> 01:26:41.596
PLAY DO APPRECIATE THE THE

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:42.897
GOVERNOR LOOKING AT THE

01:26:42.964 --> 01:26:45.433
TRANSITIONAL PIECE -- IT AND

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.734
I'VE GOT ONE MORE DAY SHIFT

01:26:46.801 --> 01:26:49.203
GEARS ON YOU GUYS -- THE SWITCH

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.406
BACK OVER THE AG SIDE -- THAT

01:26:51.472 --> 01:26:54.909
MISTER COOPER -- TOUCHED ON I

01:26:54.976 --> 01:26:57.912
HAVE GREAT CONCERNS WITH THE

01:26:57.979 --> 01:27:03.718
ZERO DOLLARS ADVOCATE YOU DID --

01:27:03.785 --> 01:27:05.119
ON THE DERRY METHANE SIDE -- I

01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.354
REPRESENT THE DAIRY CAPITAL OF

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:06.654
THE WORLD.

01:27:06.721 --> 01:27:07.255
AND I'VE SEEN THESE PROJECTS

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.592
WORK VERY VERY WELL AND MOVE

01:27:10.658 --> 01:27:12.226
FORWARD TO HELPING US REACH.

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:14.696
OUR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS.

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:17.599
BUT IT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:19.167
PROGRAM.

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:21.269
AND AND GETTING IT ISN'T GOING

01:27:21.336 --> 01:27:22.604
TO HELP US GET THERE.

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.639
AND AS WE ALL HEAR ON THE NEWS

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:25.873
OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.775
NOT TO JOKE WITH THIS IDEA THAT

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.410
CALIFORNIA'S ARE CAUSING GLOBAL

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:32.113
WARMING -- THAT'S NOT

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.781
NECESSARILY THE WAY IT WORKS IN

01:27:33.848 --> 01:27:35.683
WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.151
CAPTURE THAT METHANE.

01:27:37.218 --> 01:27:40.588
IN USE IT IS NATURAL NATURAL GAS --

01:27:40.655 --> 01:27:41.389
WHICH IS ACTUALLY MORE

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:44.359
BENEFICIAL OVER ALL AS RENEWABLE

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.761
FUELS SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT IT

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:50.932
