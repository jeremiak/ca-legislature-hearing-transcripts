WHILE ALSO BEING MINDFUL RESPECTFUL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS WE ALL FACE. THIS IS AN ANXIOUS TIME I KNOW BUT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF AN OPEN AND WORKING LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES. CONTINUE TODAY WE ARE HERE TO DISCUSS AND PROVIDE COMMENT ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITIES DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. THE SPEAKER MY COLLEAGUES AND I BELIEVE THIS HEARING IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE RIGHT NOW. NOT ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE AND WE ARE AT A CRITICAL DECISION POINT. THE FRANK THE PANDEMIC CRISIS WE ARE CURRENTLY FACING IS GOING TO FORCE US TO REALLY EXAMINE OUR SPENDING PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW. THIS TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY IS A PLACE TO BEGIN THAT EXAMINATION. THE STATUE REQUIRES TO THE HILT A FORTY PUBLISHED AND SUBMIT TO THE LEGISLATURE A DRAFT PLAN EVERY TWO YEARS. EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES THE AUTHORITY TO INCORPORATE ANY COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC INTO ITS FINAL BUSINESS PLAN. THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY IS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT FOR THE AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER BEFORE ADOPTING ITS FINAL VERSION OF THIS PROPOSED PLAN. SINCE BEING ELECTED GOVERNOR SOME HAS SHIFTED THE FOCUS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM. THESE SHIFTED AWAY FROM CONNECTING TO REGIONS WITH THE VALLEY TO VALLEY INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENTS FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO BAKERSFIELD. TO A SHORTER INTER REGIONAL TRAIN AND ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL LINE FROM WERE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. THE AUTHORITY ESTIMATES CENTRAL VALLEY LINE WILL COST EIGHTEEN POINT THREE BILLIONTO BUILD AND WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE. ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR REMAINS COMMITTED TO BUILDING THE FULL SYSTEM HE STATES THAT HIS NEW PLAN IS FOCUSED ON WHAT THE STATE CAN DO WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. RIGHT NOW. THIS SOUNDS VERY REASONABLE WHAT IS LESS CLEAR IS WHY HE IS CLAYTON CONSULTANTS WHO HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN DICTATE HOW THE STATE SHOULD INVEST ITS RESOURCES. EVERY ITERATION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL PLAN THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE SEEMS TO GROWING COST. AND SHRINK IN SCOPE. AND AT SOME POINT WITH THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE JUST GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRUST THE AUTHORITIES ABILITY TO DO WHAT IT PROMISES. OR ARE WE GOING TO FIND BETTER WAYS OVERSEE THIS PROJECT AND JUST SPEND THE STATE'S NOW LIFTED RESOURCES. WE ALL KNOW IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION ONE EIGHT TO PROVIDE NINE BILLION IN BONDS TO HELP BUILD A FIVE HUNDRED. MILE LONG HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES. AND AT THAT TIME THE ESTIMATE FOR THE FULL COST OF THE PROJECT. WAS THIRTY THREE BILLION. AND IT WAS GOING TO BE COMPLETED. THIS YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY. SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE SEEN NUMEROUS VARIATIONS ON WHERE THE REAL AND WOULD BE BUILT. AND COULD BE BUILT AND WHEN WE COULD EXPECT A COMPLETED SYSTEM. KATA FLUCTUATED FROM HIGH OF NEARLY ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS DOWN TO SIXTY FOUR BILLION AND MOST RECENTLY EIGHTY BILLION FOR THE FULL PHASE ONE SYSTEM IF IT WAS COMPLETED BY. TWENTY THIRTY THREE. EVERY NEW BUSINESS PLAN PROMISES THAT PROBLEMS OF THE PAST HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED AND THAT THIS TIME WE HAVE IT RIGHT. MEANWHILE WE HAVE IS A CONSULTING FIRMS AND HAVE BILLS. VERY LITTLE. THOSE JOBS A CLAIM TO CREATE OR NOT CONSTRUCTION JOBS THEIR CONSULTANTS PUSHING PAPER. THIS PLAN PROMISES TO INCLUDE ACCURATE COST AND TIME LINES AND PROMISES THE BEST RETURN ON OUR LIMITED INVESTMENTS. I'M NOT SO SURE. IT SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE ANYTHING THE AUTHORITY CLAIMS AS PLANNED. NEARLY EVERY STATE IN THE PLAN FROM EMISSION REDUCTIONS TO JOBS CREATED FROM INVESTMENTS IN THE BOOKENDS TO RIDERSHIP COMPARISONS. SEEM EITHER MISSING. OR DOWN RIGHT NOT TRUE. MY HOPE IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN THAT WE CAN JUST HAVE AN HONEST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF THIS PROJECT. AND HOPEFULLY TODAY WE CAN FINALLY BEGIN THAT CONVERSATION. NOW I WANT TO BE CLEAR. I'M NOT ADVOCATING FOR THE END OF THE DREAM OF A HIGH SPEED RAIL CALIFORNIA. WE COMMITTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO THE VOTERS. THAT WE WOULD PURSUE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE AND THAT IS WHAT WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO. BUT IS THE AUTHORITY HAS SAID FOR YEARS NOW. THAT DREAM MUST BE BUILT IN BLOCKS. WHAT I'M SEARCHING FOR I AM SURE YOU ARE ALSO AT THIS POINT WHAT'S SET OF BLOCKS SHOULD WE BUILD FIRST IN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS AS THE FUNDING PARTNER IN THIS EFFORT WE THE LEGISLATURE SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS PROJECT. OF FUNDING AND ALSO THE OVERSIGHT. AND WE MUST TAKE THIS RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS THE TIME COLLEAGUES TO REALLY DIG INTO THE PLAN. AND WE REALLY SHOULD GET STARTED. TODAY THE AUTHORITIES DIRECTOR BRIAN KELLY AS WELL DID KIM THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION AGENCY OR PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATING TODAVÃ­A VIDEO CONFERENCING FROM A ROOM LOCATED HERE IN THE CAPITAL. IT WILL APPEAR ON THE SCREEN SO MEMBERS CAN WATCH THEIR TESTIMONY LIVE AND ALSO ASK QUESTIONS. OF THESE WITNESSES. FOLLOWING THEIR PRESENTATION WE WILL HEAR FROM HELEN KIRSTINE.

THIS GROUP NEED THIS GROUP IS THAT OUR EXPERTS ADVISING THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE OUTSIDE THE PROJECT. DEVELOPERS THESE PRIVATE CITIZENS ARE PUTTING THEIR YEARS OF EXPERTISE AND HELPING US GOVERN THIS MONUMENTAL PROJECT AND WE OWE THEM A GREAT DEAL OF GRATITUDE. AND IF YOU CAN FINALLY WILL HEAR FROM- VIA PHONE DR BRIAN TAYLOR DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE OF TRANSPORTATION STUDIES AT UCLA. AN EXPERT ON TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. SO MEMBERS I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR JOINING ME TODAY FOR A FOR THIS IMPORTANT OVERSIGHT HEARING. I HOPE THAT TOGETHER WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE CLEAR THE ASSEMBLIES HOAX.

I WOULD ALSO ASK THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE GET STARTED WITH OUR- OUR WITNESSES. THANK YOU THAT FOR THAT.

OKAY WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE HOUSEKEEPING WE'VE GONE THROUGH THE PANEL OF EXPERTS WILL BE HERE BEFORE US TODAY AGAIN I THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR BEING HERE AND GAS. WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS INTRODUCE OF. NUMBER ONE ON OUR- ON OUR PANEL OWN IN THE ORDER OF GOTTEN MISTER DAVID KIM SECRETARY CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION OR AGENCY MISTER CAMP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT IS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU TODAY- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT. IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THIS HEARING WAS SCHEDULED ORIGINALLY FROM MARCH SIXTEENTH OR SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE SO- IT'S REALLY. IN ORDER. NOT JUST FOR WHAT. HEARING LOGISTICS WHICH WILL BE ROUTINE FROM THIS POINT OUT SO THANK YOU FOR CAN US. SO WE KNOW THAT I CAME HERE ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO TO TAKE ON THIS NEW THINGS WE DID WHAT GOD TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. WAS TO DEVELOP A NEW VISION ST. THAT VISION IS VERY SIMPLY. TO TRANSFORM THE LIVES OF ALL CALIFORNIANS THROUGH THE SAFETY. ACCESSIBLE LOW CARBON TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. ARE VERY MUCH BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT EMBODIES THE VISION AND WILL TRULY TRANSFORM THE NATURE OF TRAVEL. CALIFORNIA AND- UNDERSCORES THIS ADMINISTRATION'S COMMITMENT TO BRINGING CLEAN ELECTRIC HIGH SPEED RAIL TO CALIFORNIA. AND OVER THE FEW MONTHS AS ALL OF US HAVE COLLECTIVELY GRAPPLED WITH THE- INCREDIBLE ECONOMIC. ACT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN AND DEMOCRATS. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT BOLSTERING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS A MAJOR PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US. THAT MEANS DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO CREATE WELL PAYING JOBS FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS PROJECT IS NOT JUST A SOLUTION TO THAT IMPERATIVE BUT IN FACT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL PROGRAMS ALREADY UNDER WAY. IT'S A JOB CREATION. NOW AND WELL INTO THE FUTURE. DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION YOUR DEAL IS AN ACTIVE BY PRESIDENT FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT THAT STIMULATED THE ECONOMY PROJECT THAT INVOLVES. THE STRUCTURE. AS CALIFORNIA BEGIN TO RECOVERING FROM THE CURRENT RECESSION WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE FROM HISTORY THAT DEMONSTRATES SUCCESSFUL RECOVERY EFFORTS AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM FOR. IF WITH YOU JOBS IN SOME OF THE MOST. HARD HIT REGIONS OF THE STATE. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT CONTINUES DANCING PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTION OF THE VOTERS. AND IS OUT ONE. WITH WHAT THE SIZE THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IT IS OFTEN AND OPERATE A LOOK HIGH SPEED TRAINS IN CALIFORNIA. THE STRATEGY LAID OUT BY THE FORTY OUT ONCE THE BILL'S PRUDENT WAY TO PAY THE SUBJECTIVE WITH CARD AVAILABLE FUNDING. THE PLAN DESCRIBES REGGIE JUDICIARY HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE FROM HER SAID THE BIGGEST. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BROWN WORKED TO EXPAND BEYOND THE CENTRAL VALLEY INTO THE BAY AREA AND TELL A- I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS A LONG TERM YES MA'AM. THAT IS DIRECTLY TIED THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION AND OF OUR LOCAL. CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION REACH FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE BY THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTY FIVE. WE NEED A PLAN THREE TRANSFORMATIVE SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED AND PROVIDED BY METAL PETER TRANSPORTATION ALTERNATIVES. LET'S CONSIDER FOR A MOMENT THE IMPACT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY ONE IT IS THE- ABOUT A FOUR THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED HIGHWAY LANE ALSO. NINETY ONE AIRPORT GATES. TO BRAND NEW AIRPORT RUNWAYS. BUILDING THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE WOULD COST THE STATE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS. I ALSO WANT TO POINT THAT BY ADVANCING HIGH SPEED RAIL WE ARE SHOWING THAT CALIFORNIA IS INVESTING IN THE PRESENT. AS WELL AS BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE. THROUGH THIS PROJECT WE ARE LEADING THE NATION IN ARCHERY IN A NEW ERA OF CLEAN TRANSPORTATION. WHAT A TO FLY HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE DR. STATE REAL SAID. LET ME STATE AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. EDITING ELECTRIFICATION NOW AT THIS CRITICAL CRITICAL JUNCTURE WOULD DELIVER A SERIOUS WELL IN THE STATE EFFORTS TO MEET OUR OFFICIALS CLIMATE GOALS. IN FACT I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH CONTAIN. TO BE THE LAW PRODUCER OF EMISSIONS WILL BE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT WITHOUT WIDE EYES RAIL. ALSO I THINK IT'S A TO RECOGNIZE THE CALIFORNIA IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF DEVELOPING AN ENTIRELY BRAND YOU AMERICANS INDUSTRY WERE INVESTMENT IN AND THE DEFAULT OF TECHNOLOGIES MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES AND INNOVATIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES WELL CREEK HIGH SKILLED. GOOD PAYING JOBS IN THIS WILL CLEARLY HELP REBUILD OUR STATE AND NATION. AS WE RECOVER FROM CODE NINETY. BUT BEYOND TECHNOLOGICAL TRANSFORMATION THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS ALL ABOUT TRANSFORMING PEOPLE'S LIVES. UP WITH THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES IN CALIFORNIA'S POOREST HARDEST HIT AREAS AND PROVIDING FULL ACCESS TO THE ECONOMY TO RESIDENTS FROM ALL REGIONS OF THE STATE. THE SERIES OF MERCED FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD REMAIN GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED FROM THE REST THE STATE WHICH IS MADE IT CHALLENGING FOR COMMUNITY LEADERS TO ATTRACT MORE BUSINESSES. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS NOT ONLY CREATING SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY I'LL PUT. IT WILL BREAK YOUR GEOGRAPHIC BARRIERS AND GREAT CRITICAL LINKAGES BETWEEN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND LARGER. MORE DIVERSE ECONOMIES IN THE BAY AREA AND LA BASE. THE BUSINESS PLAN EXPLAINED FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE INVESTING IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY INITIAL OPERATING SEGMENTS. WILL RESULT IN IMMEDIATE. MEANINGFUL BENEFITS TO THE TRAVELING PUBLIC COMPARE TO SIMILAR LEVEL OF INVESTMENT HIGH SPEED RAIL INVESTMENT IN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE. MY FIRST EXPOSURE TO THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT OCCURRED DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN I WAS A SENIOR OFFICIAL AT THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION. IN RESPONSE TO THE GREAT RECESSION. PRESIDENT OBAMA PROPOSED AND CONGRESS ENACTED. BURKE AND- REINVESTMENT AND RICK RECOVERY ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINE. TO CREATE JOBS. EIGHTY ECONOMIC RECOVERY OF THE NATION'S POOREST AREAS SPUR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT AND BUILD NEW TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE THE PROVIDE LONG TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS. IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO CONVERT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT TO A CONVENTIONAL DIESEL RAIL SERVICE RATHER THAN A HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFY TRAIN SERVICE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE RISK THAT THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION WILL WILL ASSERT THAT THE AUTHORITY HAS. LARA PRACTICALLY. AS THE BENEFICIARY OF OR HIGH SPEED RAIL GRANTS IT IS NOTABLE THAT MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO WORK ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SINCE THE START OF CONSTRUCTION. ALSO. FIVE HUNDRED SMALL BUSINESSES ARE INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE SEEN INVESTMENT OF FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN PLANNING AND BUILDING RESULTING IN EIGHT POINT ONE TO NINE POINT TWO BILLION IN ECONOMIC OUTPUT. EVERY WHAT I AGREE WITH YOU ON THE- A GROUP OF. THE THREE OF. THE WAY. YEAH YEAH YEAH. THE PROBLEM WITH. BUT THE CURRENT OF THE. WITH THE- CAN WE GET OF. WE'RE TO MR KENNEDY'S WE'VE LOST THE FEED. OKAY YEAH WE LOST ABOUT A MINUTE AGO SO IF YOU CAN BACK UP A LITTLE BIT. OKAY SURE. THE HERE. OKAY IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO CONVERT THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT TO A CONVENTIONAL DIESEL RAIL SERVICE RATHER THAN A HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFY TRAIN SERVICE THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE RISK THAT THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION WILL CONCLUDE. HAVE REACHED THE ARE. AS THE BENEFICIARY OF OUR HIGH SPEED RAIL GRANTS IT IS NOTABLE THAT MORE THAN THREE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS HAVE BEEN DISPATCHED TO WORK ON A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SINCE THE START OF CONSTRUCTION. ALSO FIVE THIS IS OUR INVOLVED WITH THE PROJECT IN RECENT YEARS WE HAVE SEEN INVESTMENT OF FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN PLANNING AND BUILDING RESULTING IN A POINT ONE TO NINE POINT TWO BILLION ECONOMIC OUTPUT. IN EVERY WAY. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT HAS EXCEEDED CONGRESS'S INTENT. OF LIFT REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND CREATE JOBS IN THE HARDEST HIT AREAS LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS THE PANDEMIC BEGINS TO GRADUALLY SUBSIDE THIS PROJECT IS EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL AS RETURN TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY. THAT'S I WANT YOU I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE FULLY SUBSCRIBE TO THE VIEW THAT BOOSTING TRANSIT AND RAIL INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. AND ON THAT POINT I WANT TO NOTE THAT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN RECENT YEARS AND THESE RICH WILL CONTINUE LET ME JUST REVIEW A COUPLE OF KEY DATA POINTS. SO THE- DOESN'T FOUR POINT ZERO. BILLION DOLLARS. IN TRANSIT AND COMMUTER RAIL SYSTEMS PROJECTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND THE NUMBER IN NORTHERN. POINT FOR BILL IT. NUMBER FOUR POINT SIX DOLLARS AND SEVEN CALIFORNIA FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA LOOKING AHEAD OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS UP TO FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS STATE PROGRAMS FULL FORM HEADED OF. OTHER STATE FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO VANCE RAIL TRANSIT PROJECTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA I WANT TO NOTE THAT NOT THESE DOLLARS ARE AVAILABLE THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. THESE FUNDS WERE. REALLY OF MY SB ONE THANK TO YOUR LEADERSHIP MISTER CHAIRMAN A K. AND TRADE IN THE SHOWCASE YOUR COMMITMENT ALONG WITH THE COMMITMENT OF OUR VOTERS TO EXPAND TRANSIT OPTIONS FOR ALL. IN FACT. JUST LAST HEALTH AWARDED FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT TO WORK THROUGH THE TRANSIT AND INTERCITY RAIL CAPITAL PROGRAM FOR T. R. C. P. TO SEVENTEEN RECIPIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THESE GRAVEL PLAY A HUGE ROLE IN GENERATING MUCH NEEDED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THEY WILL ALSO ADVANCE TRANSFORMATIVE HELP WILL PREVENT THAT WILL MODERNIZE INNER CITY. COMMUTER AND URBAN RAIL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS BUS AND FERRY TRANSIT SYSTEMS. THESE INVESTMENT WILL SIGNIFICANT. WHILE TROUBLED AND CONGESTION IT IS WORTH POINTING OUT THAT PREVIOUSLY AWARDED T. I. R. C. P. GRANTS HAVE SUPPORTED SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING THE BART EXTENSION TO SAN JOSE AND MULTIPLE RAIL PROJECTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO PREPARE FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT. SUMMER OLYMPICS. RICHARD SHERMAN MEMBERS AS WE COLLECTIVELY WORK TOWARD RECOVERING FROM THE COLD IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME TALKING THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION NEEDS AND BUILDING A MORE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE. I VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING CLOSELY WITH YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU AND I LOOK FOR TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SECRETARY KIM ANY QUESTIONS OF THE SECRETARY OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. US SECRETARY WILL I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENDING THE- HEARING TODAY AND- LOOK FORWARD TO SUCCESSFUL- TERM AS THE SECTOR YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB THUS FAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL. ANALYST MISTER KELLY BRIAN KELLY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL. WELCOME TO OUR BRAIN. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN IT'S BEEN SOME TIME SINCE I'VE SEEN YOU- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. EVEN VIRTUALLY AND- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE HERE TODAY I AM ALWAYS HONOR TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I THOUGHT I WOULD- USE A POWER POINT PRESENTATION TO CONVEY SORT OF A SUMMARY. OF THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN WHICH I WILL ROLL THROUGH. THAT WITH YOU HERE MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS. ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN THE- NEW WORLD OF COVERT NINETEEN I THINK THAT'S A RELEVANT- ISSUE. CAN BE LOST. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GUYS CAN SEE THE POWER POINTS I WANT TO TRY TO GET BACK ON THE SCREEN. BEAR WITH ME JUST ONE SECOND HERE. OKAY THANK YOU ANYWAY I AS I SAID I AFTER THE POWER POINT A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT- WHERE WE ARE NOW WE'RE NEVER GETTING TO THIS IS A VERY UNIQUE TIME- ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH WE DID RELEASE A DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN OF- FOR HOW WE WOULD PROCEED A MOVING FORWARD- WITH THIS TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECT. FIVE TEETH IN THE CALIFORNIA IS A NATIONAL LEADER ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL IS A VERY INTEGRAL PART OF THAT AND WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE POLICYMAKERS I DO NOT TURN BACK OF THAT COMMITMENT TO MOVE FORWARD ON A CLEAN SUSTAINABLE- FAST THE RAIL RAIL FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW THE COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN ARE GENERALLY WITHIN THE RANGES OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN- BUSINESS PLAN WHICH WAS THE FIRST BUSINESS PLAN SINCE I. CAME OVER THE HIGH SPEED RAIL FORTY WHERE. USE RANGES TO DESCRIBE ACOSTA ESTIMATES AND I WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT. UP THE REASON WE MOVED TO RANGES AS I. AS I. TOOK THIS POSITION AND MOVED INTO THIS- JOB I DID NOT THINK IT WAS. OF APPROPRIATE- TO TRY TO. PROVIDE A SINGLE A DOLLAR SIGN ESTIMATE FOR WHAT THE PROJECT WOULD COST. WHEN SO MUCH OF THE PROJECT IS STILL IN THE PROJECT DELIVERY FACE. EARLY PROJECT LIVE BATES. IT'S WORTH REMINDING. THEM THAT- ABOUT SIX OF OUR REMAINING. OF SEGMENTS ARE STILL IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS NOW IS I'LL GO THROUGH ALL INDICATE THAT WE ARE. MOVING IN AND OUT ACCIDENT. THROUGH THE FARM PROP AS- I THAT IS EARLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT. ROSS SAYS TO TRY TO ESTA WITH SPECIAL WHAT THE COST WOULD BE AT THAT POINT IS A KNOT INVESTOR PRACTICES- BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR COST ESTIMATING SO WE MOVED TO A RANGE OF- ESTIMATED TWENTY TWENTY PLAN- CONTINUES THAT THAT- THAT APPROACH. A THIRD- WE TAKE THAT THE BEST USE OF AVAILABLE HIGH SPEED RAIL FUNDING IS TO EXPAND THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT- OF. FROM CURRENTLY RIGHT A POPULAR AVENUE A HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH. TO REALLY CONNECT THREE THE MAIN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SAID FRESNO IT MAKERS. OF WE'VE GOT ADDITIONAL REVIEW THAT PROPOSAL AND OUR BUSINESS PLAN LAID OUT. SOME OF THOSE WERE BOTH FROM. G. AND ENJOY. LOOK AT A REFINED CASE AND ALSO OUR TRAIN A WHO'S THE FROM THE RUN TYSON RAIL IN GERMANY WHO ALSO- DID AN ANALYSIS AND- LAID OUT THE BENEFITS OF THIS APPROACH SO. INCLUDED BOTH OF THOSE- SUMMARIES OF IN OUR IN OUR TWENTY. A TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN FOURTH. AND I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT NOTE OFTHIS ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO EVOLVE UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF CHANGE- IN THE LAST- TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS- I THINK WE'RE NOW ON THIS COMING UP WITH THE SIX- CHANGE ON OUR BOARD- WE'VE- WE'VE CHANGED ALMOST THE ENTIRETY OF THE- OF EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM IN HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT PROPOSAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE NOW THE BUDGET- THAT MOVES- AWAY FROM A SOME CONSULTING SERVICES TOWARD IT'S THAT TO LINE. THE FORMER ORGANIST INTO REALLY FUNCTION INTO THAT THAT'S A PROPOSAL SPENDING A NOW THE PROCESS AGAIN PART OF AN ORGANIZATIONAL REFORM THAT STARTED EARLY I GOT. WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE. IN FIVE WE NOTE THAT RAIL IN KEEP IT IN CROSS THE STATE. WHILE HIGH SPEEDS ARE DELIVERED FROM A MERCED THE BIGGEST BILL I THINK YOU SECRETARY KEMP LAID OUT A WHILE WE HAVE. THE SORT OF THE WELL DEFINED THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER. TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SOURCES AVAILABLE. BUDGET IS AROUND THE STATE THE END UP CERTAINLY THE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY THE LEGISLATURE OTHERS PLAY A KEY ROLE. IN IN WHERE THOSE DOLLARS GO BUT THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE. TO MOVE THE STATE OF AS I INDICATED A NUMBER ONE ABOVE. A TO CONTINUE TO BE THE NATIONAL LEADER BUT NOT JUST WITH THIS PROJECT. WITH SMART REGIONAL. LOCAL TRANSIT PROJECTS WELL. SO THOSE ARE THE BY T. THEMES ARE IN THE BUSINESS PLAN AND THEN. I THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO SORT OF TAKE A SNAPSHOT OF WHERE WE ARE. WITH ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. NOT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OF ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL UNDER DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE- IN THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION MOST IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR. ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CALTRAIN SAYS CALTRAIN IS THE COMMUTER RAIL THAT RUNS BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO AND SAN JOSE. VITAL VERY DIDN'T INVENT. IN A- THAT CORRIDOR. WHICH PROVIDES SHORT TERM BENEFITS FOR CALTRAIN AND ULTIMATELY WATER BENEFITS FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN OUR SERVICE. THEY GO THROUGH THAT STRETCHES OF THE ELECTRIFICATION. IS BOTH THE SHORT TERM GAIN IN THE LONG DURING GAME FOUR OF THOSE WHO RIDE. A TRANSIT IN FUTURE SB RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. IN THE MIDDLE PART OF THE STATE IS THE- ACTION OF A ARE ALSO APPEARED. ADVANCE ELECTRIFICATION ON A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILES. TODAY WE ARE UNDER CONSTRUCTION ON A HUNDRED NINE MILES BETWEEN MADERA. BUT THE LOCATION ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND. OF BIG CALL POPULAR AVENUE- WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH INTO THE URBAN. AREAS OF BAKERSFIELD AT THE SOUTH MERCED A TO THE NORTH OF GIVING US A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND ELECTRIFIED RAIL. AND THEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA I THINK THAT THE NEW PLAYER ON THE BLOCK IS. IS VIRGIN TRAINS- WHICH THE- IDENTITY THAT IS CAUSING TO BUILD UP HIGH SPEED RAIL BETWEEN LAS VEGAS. AND AT LEAST AS THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK DOWN THERE- TO VICTORVILLE CALIFORNIA ULTIMATELY OF COURSE VIRGIN AS OR AS I SAID ON EXTENDING TO PALMDALE AND THEN FURTHER SOUTH. THE INTO THE LA BASIN SO WE SEE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES TO. SEE IF WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER TO. BRING ELECTRIFIED SPEED AND THAT BASIN AS EARLY AS WELL THE DOTTED LINE ON THIS MAP UP. ARE WE STILL IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT APPROVAL SAYS AS OF TODAY. IF WE LOOK FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS WERE YOU NOW WOULD HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES. OF FULLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN ALL OF PHASE ONE BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- IS PROPOSED TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY CLEAR. THAT'S WHY THOSE DOTTED LINES NOW BECOME SALAS. UP THIS IS NOT A MINOR ACHIEVEMENT- A CLEARING OF FIVE HUNDRED IN ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED MILES. ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL OF ROUTE IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH VERY DIFFERENT TOP GRAFFITI AT THEIR VERY DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHY OF. THESE VERBS REGIONS OF. FORMULA IS QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT THE NAY ALLOWS. BUT THEN THE START DOING SOME OF THE IMPORTANT PRE CONSTRUCTION WORK EXPANDING DESIGN. ENGAGING AND I WENT NEARING AS ARE THE MAP THE NECESSARY RIGHT AWAY. ODJICK THEY AS THIS IS IN A MILE AND- AND AGAIN OF REFLECTIVE OF TRUE ADVANCEMENT IN THE SPIRIT OF A PROP ONE A. AS I KNOW WE- WE PROPOSED TO EXTEND IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN- THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE SEGMENT TO GET INTO BAKERSFIELD AND PERCENT. MAKING IT A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE MILE INTEREST THIS IS THE ONLY SECTION THE STATE THAT- WROTE TRAINS CAN A TRULY RUN AT HIGH SPEED RAIL IT'S DESIGNED TO RUN DOING ANY MILES PER HOUR- AND- BRING HIGH SPEED RAIL- WHAT YOUR FIGHT HIGH SPEED RAIL INTO THIS AREA. WILL REVIEW OF ALL TIME BY. UPWARDS OF NINETY MINUTES. ONE MILES WOULD ALSO EXPANDS OF THE ECONOMIC. IMPACT AND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT SECRETARY KIM REFERENCE IN HIS TESTIMONY- IT WOULD EXTEND THE A NUMBER OF JOB YEARS CREATED BY THE PROJECT TO OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND WE'RE GOING TO BE A THIRTY EIGHT BILLION IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FOR THE INVESTMENT. OF A JUST OVER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS I SHOULD ALSO SAY IT HELPS US WITH BILL COMMITMENTS THAT WE MADE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON A PERMANENT JOBS IN PERMANENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF FROM THE ARRIVAL OF ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL THE MORNING. I MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THE EARLY TRAIN UP PERFORMED A SIDE BY SIDE. ANALYSIS OUTLINE THE BENEFITS OF DOING THE EXTENSION- INTO A BAKERSFIELD TO THE SOUTH OF OR SET OF NORTH. END OF THESE WITH THE CONCLUSIONS. OF REALLY OF BOTH THE- EARLY TRAIN OPERATOR AND CONFIRMED BY OUR- A FINANCIAL ADVISER THAT- THIS IS REALLY THE BEST VALUE FOR THE MONEY. THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE HERE EXPANDS THE TRAIN SERVICE TREMENDOUSLY A TODAY THAT SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE HAS ABOUT- SEVEN DAILY TRIPS BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT TO EIGHTEEN. OF THROUGH USE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CENTRAL VALLEY- REDUCING THE TRAVEL TIMES I MENTIONED I BETWEEN. A HUNDRED AND THE NINE. HUNDRED AND- OUR THAT. INCREASED RIDERSHIP WITH OR AS OPERATING COSTS THAT EXISTS TODAY IT'S ALSO UNDER CURRENT BUDGET ESTIMATES AND AFFORDABLE OF PROGRAMS- ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT TWENTY POINT FOUR BILLION. AND WE ESTIMATE AT. WE PUT ON OUR DROUGHT BUSINESS PLAN THE OF THE ESTIMATED BUDGET- OF AVAILABLE FOR THE PROJECT TO BE BETWEEN TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR. BILLION DOLLARS IN THAT RANGE IS REALLY A RANGE BECAUSE- IT'S IS DEPENDENT ON ON THE OF FUNCTIONALITY AND THE RESULTS OF CAP AND TRADE. IT ALSO CONNECTS THE SOME OF THE THREE FASTEST GROWING AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MERCED FRESNO AND BAKERSFIELD. IT PROVIDES INTERIM CONNECTIONS IN MERCED THE PLAN IS TO CONNECT WITH BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN AND A SERVICE AT A- OF A SINGLE STATION IN THE DOWNTOWN OR SET. UP ALLOWING FOLKS TO MOVES TRAINS I CAN GO ON WERE TO A SACRAMENTO OR TOWARD THE BAY AREA. OF THE A SERVICE IN THE WORKING. THE SERVICE AND- ALL OF ITS STAND A TRAVEL INTO THE LA BASIN OUT OF BAKERSFIELD THE ABBAS CONNECTIONS. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATES THE PUBLIC AND THE MARKETS THE VIABILITY OF AN OPERATIONAL HIGH SPEED RAIL CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU PLEASE THE FIRST BUILDING BLOCK ONLY THE FIRST. BUILDING BLOCK OF THE PHASE ONE STEPS GO TO LA AND I'M VISION APPROVED. BY THE VOTERS THIS IS JUST A DEPICTION OF A- AGAIN WHY WE DO A PROPOSED TO EXTEND- THE- THE ORIGINAL- SERVICE TERRITORY AGAIN THE HUNDRED NINETY MILES THE- CURRENT SOUTHERN TERMINUS IS. AT A PLACE CALLED POP RAP IN DOING. YOUR CHAPTER CALIFORNIA- SURROUNDED LARGELY BY AGRICULTURAL FIELDS- WE PROPOSED TO EXTEND THAT FURTHER- INTO DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD- IN A- ALONG AN ALIGNMENT AND AT A LOCATION IN BAKERSFIELD. OF THAT IT'S BEEN PART OF A LOCAL AGREEMENT- THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS WHERE WE APPROVES OF THE GULF THE- OF. OF LOCAL- LOCAL ALTERNATIVE FOR. THE BAKERSFIELD THE EXTENT. IN THE NORTH IT'S A SIMILAR EXTENSION IN THE MORE URBAN AREA- FROM A SERB SORT OF SUBURBAN. OF A MADERA TRAIN STATION IN A MADERA WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXTEND FURTHER A RIGHT IN THE HEART OF THE MERCED- HAVE THE NERVE NORTHERN TERMINUS. OF MEAT IN DOWNTOWN MERCED WERE AGAIN IT'LL BE BOTH THE ACE IN SAN JOAQUIN SPACES- HEADING NORTH AND WEST OF THE BEAR. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE AS AS A MAN EARLIER IT'S BEEN A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES- WE PUT IN PLACE. OF A SERIES OF GOVERNANCE MOVES AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE THAT. WE DEPICT- INTO DETAIL AND- IN THE BUSINESS PLAN BUT WE'VE ALSO REALLY START TO FEEL SOME MOMENTUM. ON THE GROUND YOU HAVE DONE. THE THINGS PICKING UP IN TERMS OF OUR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AT THIS CHART IS A SIMPLE DEPICTION OF. A WHERE WE WERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO A SPENDING ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A PER MONTH THIS IS A MONTHLY EXPENDITURES BY QUARTER. OF THE SECOND QUARTER TWENTY NINETEEN WORST ABOUT TWENTY TWO MILLION. OF MODIFIED CONSTRUCTION- CENTRAL VALLEY. NOW TRIPLE THAT. IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR. OUR LATEST NUMBERS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY. I HAVE A SAID ABOUT SIXTY SIX MILLION OF PER MONTH. THIS IS THE THESE ARE THE NUMBERS FOR THE WEEKLY AVERAGE WORKERS. A DISPATCH TO THE PROJECT THAT'S IT EACH WEEK THE NUMBER WORKERS ARE OUT WORKING ON THE SITE. AND AGAIN YOU SEE A GROWTH OF FROM THE VERSA A SECOND QUARTER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AT EACH QUARTER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO EXPAND THE CONSTRUCTION WORK DOWN THE VALLEY NOW WE HAVE. MORE WORK TO DO WE NEED TO SEE THESE EXPENDITURE RATES CONTINUE TO CLIMB- AND WE NEED TO BE DISPATCHING MORE MORE WORKERS TO THE- BUDGET SITES BUT I PLEASE THAT. IF I GO BACK ALL THE WAY TO. HE DO YOU WITH QUADRUPLED THE NUMBER OF WORKERS DISPATCH THE TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITES ON A WEEKLY BASIS IN CENTRAL VALLEY. I AND THIS IS A COURSE JUST A DEPICTION OF A OF HOW THE LARGER PROJECT ALL OF THE- CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT IN CENTRAL VALLEY. ARE PICKING UP BACK IN JANUARY TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD ABOUT FIFTY TWO MILES OF GUIDEWAY CLEAR THAT'S NOW UPTO SEVENTY EIGHT MILES- AND WE'VE TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES WE'RE- DELIVERING WITH A DOUBLE. THE NUMBER OF STRUCTURES THAT ARE EITHER COMPLETE OR IN PROGRESS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR OR SO- INVESTMENT ON THE GROUND IS- IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING VERY UP OUT OF THAT AGAIN WE HAVE. MORE WORK TO DO WE ARE WE HAVE. BONTA OF DEADLINE TO COULD THIS WORK BUT I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WE ARE- MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND- AND WHILE WE ABSENT CHALLENGES I'M HAPPY TO. TALK ABOUT THEM I AM PLEASED TO SEE- THAT OF THE WORK WE'RE PUTTING IN IS. A PAYING DIVIDENDS- DUTIES FOR THE- A PART OF LAST YEAR. HI THIS IS WHERE WE ARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL- CLEARANCES WE HAVE A TOTAL OF TEN ENVIRONMENTAL SEGMENTS. THAT NEED TO BE CLEARED FOR THIS PROJECT- IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAD APPROVED THE RECORD OF DECISION. CERTIFYING A RECORD OF DECISION FOR. A SEGMENT AND I'M- HAPPY TO SAY THAT- WE- WE- CERTIFIED A ROD RECORD OF DECISION FOR THE- OF LOCALLY GENERATED ALL TURN INTO BAKERSFIELD. IN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN. OF WERE POISED TO DO THE SECOND ONE FOR WHAT WE CALL THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHY THAT SHOULD BE DONE IS NUMBER. OF THIS YEAR SO THAT RODS- IN ABOUT A YEAR'S TIME. AT THE END OF WE HAVE A PUT OUT. OVER THE COURSE OF LAST SEVERAL WEEKS AND WE WILL THROUGH JULY. OF THIS- OF FOR ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS WILL HAVE THE DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS. ON BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE. THANK FINISH THAT TO GO THROUGH THAT ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS. A GET COMMENT TAKE COMMENT AND RESPOND TO COMMENTS. IN THAT ABOUT THIRTY MONTHS LATER WE'RE PROPOSING. A TO GET THESE RODS THAT AS WELL THE LAST TWO THAT WILL FOLLOW UP OUR- THE BALL PALMDALE TO BURBANK. SEGMENT WHICH WERE PROPOSING. A WILL PROBABLY THAT DROP WILL PROBABLY GET OUT TO THE VERY END. OF TWENTY TWENTY EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. DELAYED AND I'M SECTION- WHICH WILL COME OUT LATE TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO YOU SEE THE REVISED ROD DATES IN THE- SECOND COLUMN OVER. OF THE REGISTER COM OVER THE LAST COUPLE. IS SORT OF THE- DEPICTION OF THE FLOAT WE HAVE IT IS. THE NUMBER FUNDS BETWEEN WHEN WE POST GET THE RODS CERTIFIED AND ARE A FEDERAL DEADLINE IF THIS. WERE COMPLETE SO THERE ARE A LOT OF. TO GET IN HERE IT'S VERY INVOLVED PROCESS WITH. COMMUNITIES AND STATE BUT WE ARE MOVING. OF EFFECTIVELY RIGHT NOW CROSSES. I'M I THINK A MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL AT EITHER HAS HEARD OR WE'LL BE HEARING SOON ABOUT VARIOUS IMPACTS FROM CO IN NINETEEN TO TRANSIT SYSTEMS IN THEIR DISTRICTS YEAH THE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- BUT WE ARE NOT A DICEY REAL AUTHORITY A MEDIUM- TO IMPACTS FROM THE COLD IN NINETEEN- VIRUS- THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC IS THAT QUITE AFFECT. ACROSS THE BOARD BOTH AS A PUBLIC HEALTH MATTER IN AS AN ECONOMIC MATTER LOCALLY- BUT IS ALSO HAVING SOME IMPACTS THE CERTAINLY A RIDERSHIP OF THOSE WERE OPERATING. OF FOR US THE BE IMPACTS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- WE ARE GETTING SOME REQUESTS TO. SLOW DOWN A SOME OF OUR PROCESS IS TO ASSURE THAT- PEOPLE CAN COMMENT FOR EXAMPLE ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS- THAT- ARE- THE ARBITERS OF THE DRAGON SYSTEMS- PROGRAM ARE ABLE TO SECURE- UP ON FINANCING OTHER THINGS THEY NEED TO. RESPOND PROPERLY TO THE BEDS AND SO- WE'VE OF SLOW DOWN SOME OF THESE PROCESSES- TO ACCOMMODATE. THOSE REQUESTS SO WE ARE VERY MUCH OF. A PART. OF THE ACTIVE OF THE GOAL TO NINETY OF PROCESS I SAY THAT. OF NINETEEN THAT MAKE AND I SAID IN PART BECAUSE I THINK YOU WILL BE SEEING AS WE MOVE- TOWARD OUR FINAL BUSINESS PLAN FROM THE- DRAFT IS A PLAN THAT WE- UP OUT- A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT STRATEGY THAT ALLOW US TO COMEDY. OF WITH THE THIS EMBED OF WE CERTAINLY WANT TO ADVANCE. IS THAT THREE WORDS I'D USED WILL WE'RE GOING. ADVANCE READ. AND REPORT. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS AS I NOTED EARLIER WE HAVE. AN EXPANDING CONSTRUCTION PROJECT IN THE VALLEY WE ARE MOVING THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK- WE ARE ASSIGNING DOLLARS TO BOOK AND PROJECTS. YEAH THE LOS ANGELES AREA YEAH AND WE HAVE B	C IN PROJECTS UNDER WAY. IN THE NORTH HELP. YOU DO ADVANCED THAT WORK THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD- SO WE CAN KEEP PEOPLE PUTTING CONTINUED. PEOPLE TO WORK- AS WELL AS GET THAT GET THAT WORK DONE- WE HAVE TO RECALIBRATE OF THAT- I DO THINK- THAT- AS THE- GLOBAL PANDEMIC A IS NOT. CONCLUDED YET ANONYMOUS OR TIGHTLY CERTAIN WHAT COMES NEXT WITH THIS AND WE HAVE A VERY PRUDENT AND CAUTIOUS. I AM HAPPY MOVE MOVE FOR. SO WE WILL BE DOING MORE EXPANDED RISK ANALYSIS. OF RICH DON'T DROP UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT ALL THESE IMPACTS ARE HOW. THE IMPACT THE WORK THAT WE DO- AND- ALL WE ARE LET OUT OF THE BUSINESS PLAN A VISION THAT WE THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. TO MOVE THE PROJECT FOR A WE WILL BE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS. OF THE CONDUCT THE BILL FOR RISK IN A SAYS. THREE WEEKS. I THESE IMPACTS ARE AFFECTING OUR PRO. AND OF COURSE WILL REPORT. OF THOSE IN AS WE GET TO THE END OF THE AN EXAM WHERE WE STAND. AS WE HAD TO THE BALL FIVE I THINK THE BUDGET CYCLE FOR. NEXT YEAR OF COURSE WERE ALSO- WE HAVE A PROJECT UPDATE REPORT THAT'S DUE TO LEGISLATURE- IN THE EARLY PART OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND SO ADVANCE RECALIBRATE AND REPORT WILL CERTAINLY BE. THEMES THAT I THINK- YOU'LL SEE AS WE MOVE UP FROM THE DRAFT BUSINESS PLAN. I TO THE FINAL A BUSINESS PLAN- SO WELL WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN- I'M HAPPY TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS. IN AGAIN I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING. YOUR QUESTIONS AND THOSE OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO MR GET CITIES RAISED HIS. HAND AND MIKE TO ME NO WILL HAVE OTHER MEMBERS. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AS CHAIRMAN- TO SECRETARY THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR- YOUR PRESENTATION. I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE AS WE LIVE IN THIS. PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT WE CALL BIG NINETEEN. ONE WATER SURE SAYS CAN YOU GIVE- MAY AS WELL AS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS THE CONSTITUENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THAT ONE THAT WITH ALL THE- PLANS THAT HAD THE BUSINESS PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN. TAKING PLACE NUMEROUS TIMES AND DANGEROUS TIMES- THAT WE ON THE RIGHT TRACK- FOR SUCCESS. THAT'S ONE QUESTION AND IN THE AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION WAS SIMPLY BE- CAN WE DO THIS WITHOUT THE USE OF PUBLIC MONEY. CAN WE DO THIS PROJECT- USING- PRIVATE MONEY EXCLUSIVE I KNOW CHINA HAS DONE VERY WELL WITH USING NO PUBLIC MONEY BUT ALL PRIVATE MONEY. AND THEY SEEM TO HAVE HAD DONE THEIR HIGH SPEED WHERE ALL- WHEN I VISITED- CHINA AND THERE YOU KNOW. GALLAGHER RETURN THEIR DAUGHTER AND SEEM LIKE IT'S MAKING SENSE THAT'S MY SECOND QUESTION AND MY THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION WILL IN FACT THE- WITH THE- BUDGET THA'S BEFORE US TODAY WITH A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SHORTFALL. HOW MUCH YOU GUYS ARE ASKING FOR IN THE BUDGET. TO HELP OUR WITH THIS PROJECT IF ANY. UP SORRY DAVID. WELL THANKS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER GIBSON- I'LL TAKE A SHOT AT THE FIRST ONE AND THEN WILL DEFER TO BRIAN FOR- THE SECOND AND THIRD QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF ALL ARE WE ON THE RIGHT TRACK AND I LOVE THE EUPHEMISM- THE ANSWER IS- WITHOUT QUESTION YES I WAS NOT HERE- IN PREVIOUS YEARS WHEN ALL SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN WENT THROUGH NUMEROUS CHANGES SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT. WELL WHAT I CAN SAY IS THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE CRYSTAL CLEAR HIS EXPECTATIONS ROSS WHICH IS TO TAKE A BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH A LIVE WITHIN YOUR MEANS APPROACH TO GET GOING ON THE MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT WHILE THE SAME TIME PURSUING- ENVIRONMENTAL WORK AT THE BOOKENDS AND EVENTUALLY EXTENDED TO THOSE AREAS THIS IS A PRUDENT APPROACH AND I BELIEVE IT'S ONE THAT WILL WORK THAT'S HIS EXPECTATION FROST AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING. AND ON. TO A ORDER FOR A BRIGHT. I THANK YOU- MISTER SECRETARY I WOULD. JUST ADD THAT- IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT TRACK- QUESTION- A PARTICULAR IN THE COPA NINETEEN- ENVIRONMENT THAT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANNA- WE DO THINK WE PLAYED OUT THE MOST PRUDENT APPROACH A GIVEN THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THE PROJECT FOR HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD ON THIS- WE THINK IT IS IMPORT TO GET ALL OF THE- HUNDRED NINETY MILE. SEGMENT DONE- WHICH IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT FOR US SO WE HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT WORK COMPLETELY ENVIRONMENTAL WORK GET THE BOOK AND A PROJECTS DONE BOTH IN LA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- AND THEN THAT AGAIN EXPAND TO A MORE OPERABLE SEGMENT FROM HUNDRED NINETY TO ONE SEVENTY ONE AGAIN AS THE FIRST. BUILDING BLOCK- COMMENCE TESTING OF TRAINS AND THEN MOVING TO OPERATION SO WE THINK THOSE ARE ALL THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO IN AND ECONOMIC IMPACT IN THE EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT- ARE SUCH THAT- ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF A WHAT MIGHT BE OF LIKE THE RECESSION THE KIDS- A VITAL THAT WE HAVE THESE GUYS THE- NAMIK GOVERNMENT OPPORTUNITY THE- HAPPENING SO- SO I THINK THAT'S OF IMPORTANCE. IN TERMS OF DOING THE PROJECT- WITHOUT- WITHOUT ANY PUBLIC MONEY- I THINK UP THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES THERE THAT THAT ARE IMPORTANT BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY- I THINK YOU DO HAVE TO USE PUBLIC MONEY AND WE ARE USING PUBLIC MONEY OF FOR SOME OF THE INITIAL THE CAPITAL WORKING TO GET ENVIRONMENTAL WORK DONE TO DO THINGS LIKE WEAR. A PROCUREMENT I A USING THOSE FUNDS TO. BETTER DEFINE THE PROJECT TO THE RISK OF THE PROJECT THAT I THINK. THAT IN. THE PRIVATE CAPITAL TO. EVEN WHERE YOU HAVE A WHAT'S CONSIDERED A PRIVATE ARE THE WITH THE VIRGIN TRAINS AS IN THIS OTHER CAL REGION I MEAN REMEMBER THAT THERE IS THERE ARE PUBLIC ACTIONS NECESSARY TO MAKE THAT PROJECT OUT OF FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE USING PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY OR PROPOSING TO USE A PUBLIC RIGHT AWAY THAT MUST BE SEATED TO THEM BY THE- STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY'RE GETTING FINANCING HELP FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF THEY ARE TAKING SO THE FIST OF THE INVESTMENT RISK BUT WE ARE PROVIDING OTHER HELPFUL PARTS TO THAT- TO THAT PROJECT AND THEN LASTLY JUST AS THE BUDGET- EXERCISE WE ARE ONLY SEEKING IN THE BUDGET WHICH ALREADY APPROPRIATED A TO THIS PROJECT THIS THROUGH A CAP TRADE DETAINEES BRITISH AUCTIONS I THINK IT'S A MAJOR ABOUT THE POINTS. FOUR BILLION DOLLAR THAT'S A OF TO THIS PROGRAM. BUT THAT'S ALREADY. AS I SAID A USE THE APPROPRIATE A FUNDS FOR THIS PER AND SO WE ARE SEEKING NOTHING. UP BEYOND THAT- AND- THAT MISTER QUESTION RICH KELLY IF I MEMBERS CHAIRMANSHIP. WITH THE WITH THE ACTUAL THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES OR THE MILES THAT YOU- POSING TO DO THIS ACTUAL OBJECT. HOW MUCH IF YOU PURCHASE ALL THE LAND AND ALL THE ROADS ALREADY. TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT TO GET THIS PROJECT GOING OR IS THERE ANY OUTSTANDING PROPERTY THAT YOU NEED THAT YOU HAVEN'T PURCHASED. AND IT'LL HOW YEAH. YEAH THERE THERE IS OUTSTANDING PROPERTY BECAUSE- NINE NINETY MILE SEGMENT- WE NEED A TOTAL OF ABOUT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED PARCELS- TO COMPLETE THAT CONSTRUCTION WORK WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED- IN POSSESSION OUR WORKING THROUGH. THE REST SO THAT'S ABOUT 70% OF THE HUNDRED NINETY MILE STRETCH. AND THEN BEYOND THAT TO EXTEND THE INTO BAKERSFIELD MERCED. A WE ARE JUST FINISHING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK ON THAT NOW AND SO OUR NEXT STEP. YOU REACH THE DESIGN. OF THAT OF SEX SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY A MAP. OF THE RIGHT AWAY THAT WE NEED AT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT LESSON LEARNED. UP PROJECT- THAT I WANNA CORPORATIONS I'VE BEEN HERE IS- YOU KNOW BUT- UNDERSTANDABLE REASON THEY GOT IN BECAUSE- PRETTY EARLY. ON THE EARLY PART OF THE PROJECT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEY WERE UNDER A FEDERAL DEADLINE TO SPEND FEDERAL MONEY. AND SO THE AUTHORITY I GOT A CONSTRUCTION BEFORE HAVING ALL THE RGHT AWAY AND- WE DON'T INTEND TO REPEAT THAT- AS WE GET THROUGH THE HUNDRED NINETEEN. AND LOOKED TO EXTEND TO THE ONE SEVENTY ONE. A ONCE WE COMPLETE THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK WE'RE LOOKING TO. THE EXTENT DESIGN- MAP THE RIGHT AWAY PARCELS- IDENTIFIED UTILITIES THAT NEED TO BE REAL OKAY. AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WOULD BE WOULD BE COMPLETE BUT BEFORE WE GOT INTO. A CONCERT NEW CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS. MR FALL. ALL RIGHT. HEAR ME NOW ALL RIGHT. CERTAINLY MISTER KELLY AYE AYE I APPRECIATE YOU TESTIFYING- YOU KNOW AND- AND I APPRECIATE YOU MEETING WITH ME ON ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS I CERTAINLY HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROJECT- AND ITEMS AND IT'S NO SECRET THAT I'M NOT A FAN OF HOW THIS PROJECT HAS PROCEEDED- IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE TO MY COLLEAGUES- THAT. THIS PROJECT. HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED IN THE BUDGET. THAT WHILE WERE IN A VERY DIFFICULT BUDGET. SIT AT A VERY BUDGET DIFFICULT BUDGET SITUATION. AND WE'RE ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE SACRIFICES THIS PROJECT REMAINS UNAFFECTED. AND I WANT TO FOR. I GUESS FOCUS MY QUESTIONS- AND I AM GLAD THAT- IT WAS MENTIONED THE PHRASE LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS. AND I WANT TO USE THAT FRAMEWORK IN TERMS OF HOW- HOW WE DIVE INTO THIS PROJECT AND HOW WE EVALUATE CAUGHT. SO CURRENTLY- THE PROJECT AS YOU'VE OUTLINED IS GOING FROM MERCED TO SHARE AFTER WITH THE HOPE OF GOING TO BAKERSFIELD SO IS IT YOUR ATTENTION MISTER KELLY TO STILL EXPAND THIS PROJECT TO THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES. YES AND THEN HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO EXTEND TO THE BAY AREA. I THINK THE INCREMENTAL COST TO GET TO THE BAY AREA FROM- MERCED- PURELY ON- HIGH SPEED RAIL ASSETS THROUGH THE PROJECT GOES INTO SAN JOSE IN DECEMBER JUST GOES ESTIMATED AROUND. SEVENTEEN OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DO THAT. SO SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS TO GET TO- TO THE BAY AREA AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST TO EXTEND A TO LOS ANGELES. THAT'S THE BAKERSFIELD THE PALM DALES ABOUT SIXTEEN POINT THREE- PALMDALE TO BURBANK IS ABOUT. SEVENTEEN TO THAT'S TWENTY THREE TWENTY SIX ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY. ED YOU KNOW I'D CERTAINLY ONE DOT THE HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE WOULD- THE CHAIR IS LEGIT OR NOT SORRY I MISSPOKE FORGIVE ME- I SAID TWENTY EIGHT I SHOULD IS AT THIRTY EIGHT THIRTY. SO THIRTY EIGHT BILLION TO GET TO LOS ANGELES AND SEVENTEEN BILLION TO GET TO THE TO THE TO THE BAY AREA BACKTRACKED. ROUGH YES ROUGHLY YEAH AND YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN THIS IS OUR FONG IF I COULD I THE ONLY I WANT TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT HERE'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO MAKE MISTAKES OF THE PAST I SAID BEFORE. THAT YOU KNOW WE USE RANGES BOTH OF THESE STRETCHES YOUR IDENTIFYING ARE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAYS. AS WE WORK THROUGH. IS THE GOOD POINT. WHAT THOSE BECAUSE ARE BUT AGAIN THAT'S OUR- ESTIMATES TODAY AND- AND SO I JUST WOULD SAY THAT THE- WORST WERE EARLY IN THAT PROJECT SO I PROCESS SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THE USE OF RANGES AND IF I EVEN IF WE'RE UTILIZING THE AGES THAT WAS PROVIDED- THAT THE CHAIR S. AS STATED. THIS PROJECT HAS GROWN IN HOT SHRUNKEN SCOPE AND IF I'M LOOKING CORRECTLY THE LOW RANGE OF THIS PROJECT IS SIXTY THREE BILLION. THE HIGH RANGE OF THIS PROJECT IS A NINETY EIGHT BILLION AND YOU HAVE A BASE ESTIMATE OF EIGHTY BILLION. CORRECT. YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE BUSINESS PLAN CORRECT SO WHAT IS THE SO THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO COME TO COMPLETE THE LA TO THE ENTIRE LA TO SAN FRANCISCO SEGMENT. IS YOU'RE ESTIMATING THE LOW RANGE OF SIXTY THREE BILLION AND A HIGH RANGE OF NINETY EIGHT BILLION. CORRECT AND BUT IT COULD GO HIGHER. WILL GO WELL IT I MEAN. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE DID IS. WE'VE UP YOU KNOW INVESTMENT WHAT THE UNIT PRICES ARE FOR THAT WORK TO GET THAT WORK DONE IT KNOWLEDGE IN THAT WE'RE STILL IN THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS EARLY IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAYS THOSE SEGMENTS ARE ABOUT 15% DESIGN- NOW THERE'S A LOT. MORE TO DO THERE YEAH WE'VE ESTIMATED RANGES AT THE ENTIRETY OF PHASE ONE IS SIXTY THREE TO NINETY EIGHT WHAT WE DID IS WE USE THOSE MEASUREMENTS AND THEN WE APPLIED THE BEST INDUSTRY PRACTICES WITH THE I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE A MEMBER HERE. BUT I WANT TO SAY IT'S SORT OF A THIRTY GOING UP IN 20% TWIN DOWN. FROM THOSE OF THOSE BUT THOSE. RISE AND THAT. UP APPLY RAIN AND SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WE GET WE'VE DONE ARTS SO THEN WHAT WOULD BE ESTIMATED TIME LINE BE TO COMPLETE I KNOW YOU'RE FOCUSED ON- PHASE ONE BUT FROM THE WHOLE MADE WHAT IS ENVISIONED IN PROP ONE A WHAT WOULD BE AND GET TO SEE A TIME BUT YEAH IT IT'S GOING TO BE ENTIRE TIED TO THE- FUND. AND SO WHEN FOR TALK ABOUT THE- A PROGRAM SCOPE SHRINKING- IN MY VIEW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY SPRING A SHRINKING BUT IT'S HOW WE DO THE BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH. AND THAT IS OF LIKE IN ANY OTHER TRANSIT PROJECT. THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS- SO WHY DO WE PICKED BAKERSFIELD TO PERCENT- WE PICK BAKERSFIELD MERCED BECAUSE- THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE EXTENSION FROM HUNDRED NINETEEN. THAT WE THINK WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH OUR ESTIMATE AVAILABLE REVENUES. BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY. IN SO AS MORE MONEY BECAME AVAILABLE WITH MORE FEDERAL MONEY FOR EXAMPLE. OF GAME AVAILABLE WE- ROB LOOK. FOR EITHER TOWARDS ANODE OR A TOWARD- POPULAR IN THE SOUTH SO WITH YOU KNOW AGAIN. UP IT'S ALL FUNDING DEPENDENT FOR PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING COSTS- WE ESTIMATE A TWENTY THIRTY THREE A TIMELINE FOR ALL OF PHASE ONE. I THINK A TWENTY THIRTY ONE TIMELINE FOR THE VALUE BALLOT WHICH IS. SILICON VALLEY INTO THE BAY AREA THE SUIT YOU HAVE ESTIMATED TIMELINE OF TWENTY THIRTY ONE. FOR TO FOR HEARINGS AND THERE. TO THE BAY. OUT SO THE FRONT FROM THAT THE CENTER OF A LEAD PORTION TO THE BAY AREA. TWENTY THIRTY YES OKAY YEAH. ONE OF THE- RIGHT SO TO FOCUS ON THE CENTER PORSCHE IT IS MINE THAT THE FEDERAL HAS ASKED FOR THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS BACK FROM FROM THE FROM FROM A ARE A CORRECT. YEAH IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A NOT A SPECIFICALLY ARE TECHNICALLY FROM OUR IT WAS A LATER FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATION THEY ALL GOT THE ALL ABOUT THAT YEAH WE ARE WE HAVE SPENT AND THE FISCAL YEAR APPROPRIATION THE- TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ASKING. WE GIVE BACK. SO OF V. SO IN THE PROGRESS ON THE MERCED TO SHAFTER HOPEFULLY GETTING TO BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED PERCENTAGE OF WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEEN. COMPLETED AND HOW MUCH DID THAT COST. HEY WHAT'S LEFT TO DO. CAN YOU I'M SORRY CAN YOU AS A SERVICE SO OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PORTION HOW MUCH HAS BEEN COMPLETED TO THIS POINT TO THIS POINT. I WANT TO SAY APPROXIMATELY 40% OR SO OF THAT HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE. STRETCH IS. A COMPLETE WE'VE SPENT A TOTAL OF ABOUT- OF FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN THAT IN THAT AREA SO YOU SO YES. APOLOGIZE SO YOU'VE SPENT FIVE POINT SEVEN BILLION EARLY. OF A PORTION AB OF IN THE CENTER VALLEY IN THE YOU'VE ESTIMATED THAT- THAT RANGE FOR THE MERCEDES TO BIGELOW SEGMENT IS TWENTY. FOUR BILLION TO TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR BUT- YEAH THE TALKS THE TOTALITY OF THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH. WILL BE ABOUT A TWELVE POINT FOUR BILLION. CAPITAL COST. OF FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH. AND THEN THAT. YOU WE ADD TO THAT ABOUT- FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION MORE. OF GET BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED. STILL THERE THERE'S FIFTY THIS IN BILLION DOLLAR LEFT THAT TO BE. SPEND IT. TO COMPLETE P. WERE SAID TO BAKER SEGMENT OKAY AND THEN WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL COST OF THE OF THIS SEGMENT. I DON'T THINK THERE WASN'T A RESERVE ORIGINAL- SEGMENT FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD- THE INITIAL SEGMENT- UNDER CONSTRUCTION WAS OF THE HUNDRED NINETEEN I THINK ORIGINALLY THAT MAY HAVE BEEN A- WELL BEFORE. THEY GOT DONE WITH ALL% OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK I THINK THERE WAS A SIX BILLION DOLLAR COST ESTIMATE ROUGHLY TO GET THE ONE NINETEEN DONE THAT THAT ESTIMATES NOW TWELVE POINT FOUR. SO THEN I LOOK I GET THIS QUESTION ALL THE TIME FROM FROM MY CONSTITUENTS AND CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. WHICH IS THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT EVERY COST ESTIMATE HAS BEEN SEVERELY OFF TIME LINES HAVE ALSO BEEN SEVERELY OFF. IN THE PAST HAS SHOWN US. THAT THE BUSINESS PLAN ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN INACCURATE SO WHY IS THIS PLAN ANY DIFFERENT. THAN WHAT WE SEE AN INCREASE YEARS ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. HAS EXTENT TODAY. THAT ASSUMING. YOU KNOW POTENTIAL FEDERAL FUNDS BEING CALLED BACK. ASSUMING THE LEGISLATURE IS MEET WITHOUT ASSUMING THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS FACING A MASSIVE MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT. WE ARE THOSE INCORPORATED INTO THIS BUSINESS PLAN. YEAH I MEAN WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED YOU KNOW RISKS THERE ARE FUNDING RESEARCH THERE ARE INCLUDED IN THAT FUNDING RISK IS THE CALL BACK AT THE FEDERAL FUNDS- OF FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION I MEAN OUR VIEW WAS THERE'S NO BASIS- TO CALL THOSE DOLLARS BACK LITIGATION ON THAT IN THAT LITTLE ASIAN. OF PROBABLY GO THROUGH MUCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- TOLD EMILY- UP THE SIDE I FUNDAMENTALLY THE DISKETTE THE DECISION A CALLING BACK ANY MONEY FROM THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BE. OTHER THE PROJECT IS BEING SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS AND- AND WE ARE IN SO. AND I AM EX. WE WILL CONTINUE TO- AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THAT. AND YOU KNOW THE COURTS WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE. WHETHER NOT THERE'S A BASIS TO CALL BACK THOSE DOLLARS ARE NOT WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS. FUNDING PLAN AND LOOK AT YOU AND I'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS BEFORE BOTH. IN SETTINGS LIKE THIS AND IN MORE PRIVATE. THE CONVERSATIONS. YOU KNOW I THINK I'VE SAID TO YOU FROM DAY ONE SINCE I. GOT HERE THE REASON I MOVED- TO RANGES TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF. BUILDING A PROJECT LIKE THIS IS IT IS A MASSIVE PROJECT. WITH GREAT COMPLEXITY. AND THE REALITY IS IT'S EARLY IN. A IN MANY PLACES IT'S EARLY IN THE PROJECT DEVELOPMENT PROCESSAND IT'S INAPPROPRIATE. TO TRY TO GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC DOLLAR FIGURE OUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST WHEN WE ARE STILL WORKING THROUGH. THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS AND THAT'S WHY WE APPLY RANGES. OF STARTING IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN. CONTINUE THROUGH THE TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT- AND IN THIS TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT PASSED- BUSINESS PLANS IT BOUNCED AROUND I THINK IT WAS. BUT NOT WISE TO EVER GET TO A TRYING TO FIGHT IT TRYING TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC. ACOSTA THIS EARLY- IN THE PROGRAM- AND SO THEN THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS I THINK WE'VE ACHIEVED GREAT CONSISTENCY. BUT NOT ROLLER COASTER RIDE BUT CONSISTENCY. OF BETWEEN WHAT WE SAID IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN WHAT WE SAID THE TWENTY NINETEEN PROJECT UPDATE REPORT. AND WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING THE STRAP BUSINESS PLAN. WE STARTED THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS PLAN BY SAYING WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE FUNDING WE NEED. TO DO EVERYTHING THE AUTHORITY SAID IT. HAD TO DO. AND SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ON A BETTER. MORE ROAD BUILDING BLOCK APPROACH AND THAT'S WHAT WE- STARTED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE STUDIED IT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. WE BROUGHT AFFORD IN THIS TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN. AND WE ARE LARGELY OPERATING THE RANGES THAT WE FIRST INTRODUCED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUSINESS. SO I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE ROLE THAT YOU'RE IN I THE ROLE THAT WE ARE IN AND YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE WORKED IT LET'S JUST. IS THAT ASKING IN THIS BUDGET FORD TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS AND THEN OF COURSE WE'RE DEALING WITH A PROJECT FOR WHEN IT'S FULL SCOPE. WITH HOPE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE WITHIN THE RANGE OF SIXTY THREE TO NINETY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AT A TIME THAT WE ARE IN MASSIVE ECONOMIC- ECONOMIC- YOU NOTE THAT STRAIGHT THIS. IS A STRAIGHT AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A LARGE BY THE SAID AND ON TOP OF THAT YOU'RE ASKING A YOU YOU ARE. OF AS THE AS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY ARE LOOKING TO SIGN CONTRACTS. A LOT IN A THIRD YEAR COMMITMENT. SO WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL RISKS. BEING TAKEN BY THE STATE IF THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY MOVES FORWARD WITH SIGNING CONTRACTS THIS FOR ALL I WILL PROVIDE A THIRTY YEAR COMMITMENT AT A TIME WHERE YOU WILL BE MET. THERE THE MONEY THEN THEIR. WELL YOU SAY IT THIRTY YEAR COMMITMENT JUST WHERE WERE. ALL CLEAR WE ARE. WE ARE REQUIRED UNDER ARE FED. OF FUNDING GREEN TO GET THE TRACK STOLE THE ON THE ON THE PROJECT. AND SO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSES TO MOVE FOR. WITH THAT PROCUREMENT PROCESS A WEEKEND- MAXIMIZE OUR- ABILITY TO MEET THE FEDERAL DEADLINE. OF GETTING THAT TRACK AND STOLE. THE SO CALLED THIRTY YOU'RE A COMMITMENT IS TIED TO A MAIN REQUIREMENT. THAT THE THESE ASSETS THAT WE BUILT ARE GONNA LAST FOR GENERATIONS- AND WE'RE REQUIRED EVEN UNDER OUR FEDERAL AGREEMENT TO HAVE AT LEAST A TWENTY YEAR MAINTENANCE PLAN. OF FOR THOSE- FOR THOSE ASSETS AND SO WE HAVE PROPOSED IN ARE. A CONTRACTOR RATHER FAMILIAR DESIGN- BILL MAINTAIN. A CONTRACT STRUCTURE WHERE THE BITTER A WILL ALSO PROVIDE A COST TO MAINTAIN- THE TRACK. AND THAT TRACK ONCE BUILT IN ONE TO LATE WILL BE THERE- FOR GENERATIONS. AND WHAT THIRTY YEAR MADE IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE. FOR SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO LAST PROBABLY A HUNDRED YEARS. IT SO. THAT IT RIGHTS IS STRUCTURED THAT WAY I WOULD ALL OVER THE TAKING MY JUSTICE. OF THE CAR. IS THE SEPARATE. NOTICES TO BE FIVE PRINT INTO THESE THAT CAN ONLY BE AND ON. WHAT ONCE WORK IS READY TO EXTEND THAT TO AND ONCE FUNDING IS IDENTIFIED THE FOR THAT ATTRACTED THE FUND- IN TERMS OF THE TWO POINT FOUR BILLION THAT'S IN THE BUDGET AGAIN. THESE ARE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED A CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS A WE'VE ALREADY WE ALREADY HAVE FOR THE MOST PART OR ARE ESTIMATED. TO COME IN IN THE FISCAL YEAR. THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW COME TO THIS PROJECT TO DEVELOP- WHAT IS ONE OF THE CLEANEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- IN THE COUNTRY- AND SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING. MORE THAN THAT AT THIS TIME I THINK I. EVEN IT SAID YOU IN A PRIOR. A CONVERSATION. DON'T TELL I GO UNDER STRING OF GREAT BETTER AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. I DON'T WANT TO ASK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL- PREPARATION OF BOND FUNDS AND THEN THAT'S IN PART WHAT WE PUT IT OFF. UNTIL NEXT YEAR A BECAUSE OF I DO THINK WE ARE TURNING THIS IN THE BETTER DIRECTION- MORE ADVANCED DIRECTION. AND I THINK AS WE CONTINUE TO ACHIEVE WILL HAVE A BETTER CONVERSATION. ABOUT THE NEED TO ULTIMATELY GET BOND DOLLARS APPROPRIATED BUT AGAIN IN THIS BUDGET. IT'S CONTINUED ARE SORRY I CONTINUES PERFORATED FUNDS- THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. OF OR THAT ARE EXPECTED MINUTES FISCAL YEAR. I'M WHY A BILL EVERY YOUR CANDOR IS AYE AYES WANT TO SAY- MISTER CHAIR. NO ONE WE ARE ASKING CALIFORNIANS LIVE WITHIN OUR MEANS THE- THIS PROJECT DOESN'T LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MEANS ARE. THIS PROJECT KEEPS CHANGING THE RANGES KEEP CHANGING- HIGH SPEED RAIL IS. SIGNING IT LONG TERM CONTRACTS WERE LOOKING A RISING COSTS ARE PUTTING TAXPAYERS AT RISK AND WE NEED TO SERIOUSLY RE EVALUATE THIS PROJECT ESPECIALLY WHEN THIS STATE IS ASKING CALIFORNIANS TO SACRIFICE AND I WILL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT ON PAGE ONE HUNDRED OF THE BUSINESS PLAN IT SPECIFICALLY STATES QUOTE IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT A FINANCIALLY UNCONSTRAINED SCHEDULE IS NOT REALISTIC GIVEN THAT WE DO NOT HAVE FULL FUNDING TO COMPLETE. THIS PROGRAM THE ONLY THAT THE BUT THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT DOES THAT HAS BEEN RELEASED SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT THIS PROJECT IS UNCONSTRAINED IN SO WAY AS WE DEBATE THE BUDGET AS WE'RE ASKING TO MAKE A VERY TOUGH DECISIONS I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT THIS PROJECT. HAS NOT LIVED UP TO ITS EXPECTATIONS IN FACT THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR FOR THIS PROJECT IN MY PERSONAL OPINION IS PAST BEHAVIOR. IS A WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS PROJECT WITH OUR EYES WIDE OPEN AND IF WE'RE GONNA ASK. SCHOOLS TO GET FUNDING REDUCTIONS IF WE'RE GONNA ASK HEALTH CARE- PROGRAMS TO GET CUT IF WE'RE SHIFTING A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AT THE STATE HIGHWAY FUND. AND AT THE SAME TIME TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS SITTING IN A AN ACCOUNT FOR THIS PROJECT AND THIS PROJECT WILL NOT. SEE ANY REEVALUATION IN MY OPINION THAT'S NOT RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER. L. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANK YOU MISTER KELLY AND SECRETARY FOR BEING HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION YOU KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER I THINK IT WAS TWO MONTHS AGO RIGHT BEFORE WE WENT ON RECESS SO MUCH HAS CHANGED. IN THOSE SHORT TWO MONTHS ONE OF THOSE THINGS BEING THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT THAT WE CONVENE TO DISCUSS JUST. YESTERDAY AND I THINK THAT IT. RINGS THE STARK REALITY OF THE FINANCIAL. SITUATION OF THIS PROJECT TO THE FOREFRONT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE VICE CHAIR WAS TALKING ABOUT THE CUTS THAT WE ARE FACING. TO SIRIUS PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE DEPENDS ON EDUCATION HEALTHCARE SENIOR SERVICES FOOD NEEDS OF THE CALIFORNIANS THAT WE ARE HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT GIVING ANOTHER TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS TO THIS PROJECT FEELS LIKE. SOMETHING THAT IS HARD FOR ME TO STOMACH TO PUT IT NICELY SO. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION- I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES AND I REVIEWED YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. AND I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT IT SO FIRST ABOUT RIDERSHIP SO. THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PLAN. ANTICIPATED I'M GOING ALL THE WAY TO THE AREA CONNECTING YOU TO SAN JOSE AND IN NOT PLAN YOU HAD AN ESTIMATED FOUR MILLION WRITERS IN THIS PLAN YOU'VE NOW SHORTENED THE CORRIDOR TO BAKERSFIELD MERCED AND YET THE RIDERSHIP. IS IDENTICAL. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THEY WILL BE THE SAME AMOUNT OF WRITERS ON THE TRAIN. WHAT IT DOES NOT CONNECT INTO THE BAY AREA. I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE I DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS YOU'RE REFERENCING FOR VALUE TO VALLEY- BACK IN TWENTY I THINK YOU SAID EIGHTEEN OR SOMETHING- BUT THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS. FOR THE VALUE VALLEY SERVICE THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS OF ARE NOT FOR MILLION THEY ARE WELL ARGUMENTS ABOUT SORRY FORTY MILLION I MISS THAT FORTY. FORTY MILLION IS THE PHASE ONE. OF SAN FRANCISCO TO ANAHEIM ESTIMATE OF TOTAL RIDERSHIP. OF DOUBT ABOUT A BY ITSELF- A GROSS BETWEEN TWENTY OF THIRTY THREE AND TWENTY FORTY. BETWEEN FORTY MILLION EIGHTEEN. A MILLION OF PHASE ONE GROWS FROM A TO- TWELVE TO TWENTY THE COMBINED AND THEN GET YOU TO ABOUT FORTY MILLION WRITERS. SO THE FORTY MILLION RIDER ESTIMATE IS PHASE ONE SAN FRANCISCO TO LA AND I. CHECK THE RIDERSHIP THAT WE HAVE- FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SEGMENT. OF TODAY IF WE DO NOTHING THAT RIDERSHIP IS ABOUT A THREE AND A HALF BILLION RIDERS A DAY IF WE JUST. LEAVE THE SYSTEM AS IT IS- UNDER OUR PROPOSAL- WE'RE PROPOSING TO INCREASE A WRITER THREE RIDERSHIP CENTRAL VALLEY SERVICES- TO ABOUT EIGHT POINT EIGHT. SO OUR OUR INCREASE. A NET. GAIN OF ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT- BUT- WE GO FROM ABOUT THREE POINT SIX. BUT TO ABOUT EIGHT POINT- OVERSIGHT THREE POINT NINE TO EIGHT POINT SEVEN. PERCENT ABOUT A RIDERSHIP THE RIDERSHIP ABOUT A VALLEY IS ABOUT EIGHTEEN RIDERSHIP STATEWIDE GOES TO ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT OKAY THANK YOU SEVEN. NOW WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THOSE NUMBERS EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION- HOW MANY OF THOSE. ARE JUST RIDING THE HIGH SPEED LINE ARE YOU ADDING PEOPLE WHO RIDE IN THE CONNECTING SERVICES- ALL YES TWENTY WRITING ON HIGH SPEED RAIL. YEAH BECAUSE WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA. STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY AND THOSE OF WILL PUT TOGETHER THE STATE RAIL PLAN- IS TO OF IMPROVE THE ENTIRE CORRIDOR OF RAIL SERVICES- IN THAT SECTION SO WHAT ARE. ELECTRIFIED THE ELECTRIFIED GEN FOR WHICH SERVICE WOULD BE PROVIDED IS FROM MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD. IT DOES THAT INCLUDE CONNECTIVITY POINTS FOR WHICH THE STATE HAS ALREADY MADE MONEY AVAILABLE A TO CONNECT WITH WERE SAID- IN MERCED WITH THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM. THE H. SYSTEM AND POP. IN SORIDERSHIP ALONE ON THE MERCED THE BAKERSFIELD STRETCHES. AT ABOUT A TWO MILLION. BUT OF. THE RIGHT IN THAT ENTIRE. CORRIDOR IMPROVEMENT GET UP TO A POINT A WOULD YOU INCLUDED AT THE BENEFITS OF. OF THE CAPTIVITY WITH ALL SO IT'S A- AND WHAT. AND THE. RIGHT NOW IT. IF WE DO NOTHING WE DON'T INCLUDE THE SPEED RAIL. THAT WRITER SHE- IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT THREE POINT NINE AND THEN WE WOULD LOOK TO BUMP THAT TO A POINT. RIGHT SO AS I UNDERSTAND IT FOR THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF RAIL THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING BUILDING IN PHASE ONE. THAT'S TWO MILLION WRITERS. SO AND THE CONNECTIVITY POINTS ADD SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION SO AS I HEAR THAT I WOULD THINK THAT THE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE THING TO DO WOULD BE TO BUILD THE PORTIONS THAT HAVE HIGHER RIDERSHIP WHICH ARE NOT THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR SEGMENT WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY BUT THE CONNECTORS. OUT OF IT WHICH I IMAGINE NOT BEING HIGH SPEED RAIL WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE. WELL THERE'S A THERE'S A FEW THINGS HERE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IMPROVE RIDERSHIP ON. RAIL IN IN THIS AT THIS IN THAT. A CENTRAL VALLEY- THE ELEMENT OF BRINGING IN HIGH SPEED RAIL- REDUCING THOSE TRAVEL TIMES BY. A NINETY MINUTES- IN THAT AREA- AND HAVING THE SIMPLER CONNECTING POINTS WITH ACE- AND THE- SAN JOAQUIN SERVICES WERE SET. IT ALL WORKS TOGETHER TO IMPROVE THE RIDERSHIP THROUGH THE ENTIRETY OF THAT CORRIDOR IT'S NOT ONE THING BY ITSELF IT'S THE COMBINED WORK THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST. NOTE IS THAT YOU DON'T WE- WE HAVE TO COMPLETE WORK ON OUR FEDERAL GRANT AGREEMENT NOW FOR THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE STRETCH. BETWEEN POPULAR ADD MADERA IN SO WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS TO EXTEND- USE ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT. BILLION MORE TO EXTEND THE WORK. TO GET THE BILL IN THE SOUTH URBAN- AREA AND THE DOWNTOWN MERCED IN THE NORTH AND SO INCOME AND- IS NOT. A THE TWENTY POINT FOR ITS JUST A IS THE FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. INCREASE THE OTHER THING I JUST THAT IS FOR THOSE CONNECTION POINTS. IN MERCED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- THROUGH OTHER ADULT. THE YEAH DISTRIBUTORS IN OTHER. IS ALREADY GIVE. ABOUT A BILL DOLLAR FOR X. OF THE- A SYSTEM INTO A PERCENT. WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO IS- HAVE THAT MEET HIGH SPEED RAIL BUT THEY ARE WITH A- FOUR POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. SO QUESTION ABOUT THAT SO AS YOU MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW I REPRESENT THE TRI VALLEY INCLUDING LIVERMORE RACE RUNS CURRENTLY. AN ACE RUNS FOUR TIMES IN THE MORNING AND FOUR TIMES THE EVENING BECAUSE OF RIGHT AWAY AS ON THE RAIL TRACK. I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT THE INCREASED RIDERSHIP THAT YOU ARE ANTICIPATING HERE SO IS THERE WHAT KIND OF IMPROVEMENT IS GONNA HAPPEN TO THE A SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR THAT INCREASED DEMAND THAT YOU'RE PREDICTING. WELL THE FIRST IS. THEY'RE GONNA EXTENDED PERCENT- WHICH THEY THEY DON'T TODAY- THERE ARE- DETERMINATION POINT ON THE EAST IS IN THE STOCKTON- THE AREA SO THE FIRST EXTENSION IS DOWN TO SERIES AND THEN A FURTHER DOWN INTO- MERCED- AND THEN- BETWEEN THAT AND- UP BUS SERVICES- ACES PROPOSING WORKING SEPARATELY REALLY FROM FROM US- IS ALSO PROPOSING TO- EXTENT- ITS OWN OPERATING SERVICE THE NORTH TO. A SACRAMENTO- BY THE END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY SO THEY'VE GOT A BROADER WHAT THEY CALL I THINK IT'S CALLED THE VISION VALLEY VISION PLAN ABOUT LIKE FORWARD- PLAN WHICH IS- IN INVESTMENT IN BOTH THE SAN JOAQUIN'S- AND THE AGE SERVICES TO EXPAND- WRITER- EXPAND SERVICES A GOING NORTH INTO SACRAMENTO AND WEST INTO THE OPEN OF COURSE THE BIG RACES THE EXTENSION ALL THE WAY DOWN 2% BUT EXPAND. IS SORRY GOING DIRECTLY STATE OF THE OTHER THING IS THE- THERE IS WORK- GOING ON TO HAVE THE A SYSTEM OF ALSO- EXTEND ITS- IT'S- STATION LOCATION AND WERE SAID TO ME THE SAN JOAQUIN IN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM AND A SINGLE A SINGLE STATION SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT- ARE PART OF A THE PROGRAM. SO AS THOSE OF US THAT LIVE AS A FORMER BURKE COMMUTER AND SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS MUCH OF THE PART AND COMMUNITY EXTENDING BART OUT HAS BEEN A POSITIVE THING SESSION COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT BUT IT SURELY DOES NOT INCREASE CAPACITY IN FACT IT DOES JUST THE OPPOSITE SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT THERE IS CURRENTLY IN SUFFICIENT PASS YUNIS AROUND FOUR TIMES THE MORNING FOUR TIMES THE EVENING MAKING GO FURTHER DOESN'T INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WRITER THE ABILITY OF A WRITER'S ON THAT TRAIN IN FACT IT JUST MAKES IT MORE IMPACTED. SO MY QUESTION IS HOW YOU CAN IMPROVE BASE TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT YOU'RE SAYING IT CAN. HOLD WANTED TO SEND IT OUT I BELIEVE THEIR INTENTION IS TO EXTEND THEIR FOR YOU. AS ALTHOUGH. I DON'T HAVE BEEN FOR OF ME X. OF WHAT THAT IS IT IS YOUR RIGHT IT'S NOT JUST THE- PHYSICAL EXTENSION BUT IT'S ALSO THE- FREQUENCY EXTENSION OF THOSE- THOSE SERVICES. AND THAT'S PART OF AN EFFORT THAT THEY ARE WORKING- BUT THE- THE CAL STATE SO LEAD ON. A RAIL CHAD EDISON IS OF THE AUTHOR OF THE STATE RAIL PLAN- A AND- AGAIN WITH THE DOLLARS THAT THEY'VE BEEN. I GIVEN SO THERE'S BOTH A FREAK FREQUENCY EXPANSION. OF A AND A AND AS I SAID THERE. PROGRAM IS TO GO NOT JUST TO. NOT JUST BACK TO THE BAY AREA BUT THEY ALSO. THE LINE EXACTLY. SO THAT WE DO TO DESTINY POINTS NORTH SAID WORSE TODAY ACES JUST OFFER A SERVICE TO WHAT. SO I MEAN I THINK BACK TO THE VICE CHAIRS POINT EARLIER WE NEED ANSWERS RIGHT FOR BUILDING TRAIN ASSUMING WE CAN CONNECT INTO THE VERY USING A CITIES CURRENTLY RUNS AT SUCH LIMITED CAPACITY. WE CAN'T ASSUME ANSWERS WE NEED TO HAVE A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO CONNECTIVE ITTY AND I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF THE CHAIR IN THAT I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN BRAILLE PROJECTS AND CLEAN RAIL PROJECTS- I AM A HUGE ADVOCATE FOR VALUING WHICH I THINK IS A WONDERFUL CLEAN REAL PROJECT. AND TO THAT POINT I THINK USE THE SECRETARY SPOKE ELOQUENTLY ABOUT. NOT WANTING THOSE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO BE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED AND WANTING THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS THAT COME WITH. EXPANDING TRANSPORTATION TO COME TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY. BUT I THINK MANY OF US IN THIS BODY UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THAT GEOGRAPHIC ISOLATION MEANS CONNECTING THEM IN. THE LARGER URBAN CENTERS WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY JOBS. AND THIS CURRENT PHASE DOESN'T DO THAT IN ANTICIPATING THAT WE WILL COME UP WITH A PLAN FOR A IS TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE THAT IS INSUFFICIENT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A PLAN. AND ONE THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND THAT MEANS THAT THESE BOOKENDS. THAT ACTUALLY MEANINGFULLY CONNECTS. TO THE- URBAN CENTERS WHERE THE JOBS ARE THE WILL BRING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO PLACES LIKE STOCKTON AND THIS IN NORTHERN CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY NEAR LOS ANGELES. HAVE TO BE A PRIORITY AND NOT THE WELL WE'LL DO THIS IF WE GET THE MONEY DOWN THE LINE. BECAUSE LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU PRESENTED TO THE VICE CHAIR OF SEVENTEEN BILLION AND THIRTY EIGHT BILLION TO CONNECT TO LOS ANGELES AND- THE BAY AREA I THINK GIVEN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC TIMES IN THE FORECAST IS NOT. REALISTIC ANY TIME. IN THE FUTURE THAT I CAN SEE SO. BUT I HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I'M THE TICKET PRICE IT ISN'T MENTIONED IN THE BUSINESS PLAN. RIGHT UP. YEAH WE HAVE TO AS WE GET INTO THE OPERATING- MODE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF AN AGREEMENT- THAT'S- THAT'S RIDGE WITH- THE OPERATORS OF THAT SYSTEM WHICH HAS WE PROPOSE THAT WE ARE NOT WE WOULD NOT BE- DIRECTLY OPERATING THAT SYSTEM IT WOULD BE A THROUGH THE SAN JOAQUIN'S A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY OF WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE MODELED WITH RIDERSHIP WOULD BE A BASED ON- PRICES THAT ARE THE SAN JOAQUIN SPARES TODAY SO THE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD FOR EXAMPLE IS ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT THE- BETWEEN THE TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY EIGHT DOLLAR FARE WHICH IS. IN LINE WITH SAN JOAQUIN'S- FAIRS TODAY A MORE BROADLY ON A PHASE ONE AND OTHERS THEY- HIGH SPEED RAIL DEVELOP THE FORMULA SOME YEARS AGO ON WHAT- TICKET PRICES THAT WILL. AIRLINE PRICES THAT ARE. A SORT OF THE PLAY HOLDER FOR DOING REVENUE AND RIDERSHIP- ESTIMATES BUT SPECIFIC FAIRS- WILL BE PART OF THE OPERATING AGREEMENT THAT'S NOT YET IN PLACE- BUT- AGAIN FOR PURPOSES OF ESTIMATING RIDERSHIP WE USE THE- A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY. AFFAIRS FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM IS ABOUT. SEVEN CAN YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT. PROFIT OR LOSS. ONCE IT'S BUILT WHAT I MEAN I DON'T SEE THOSE NUMBERS ANYWHERE OF WHAT IT WILL CALL THE COST OPERATE THIS. WITH BEES AND FAIRS THAT ARE COMING IN WITH YOUR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WHAT KIND OF. AMP SYMBOL OF THE OPERATING PROFITS SO WHAT KIND OF LOSS WILL YOU BE OPERATING AT. WELCOME TODAY- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIZES THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE- THE TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT EIGHTY ONE MILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR AND- WHAT WE- ESTIMATE HERE- UNDER OURS- OUR PLAN. STILL HAVING THE SAN JOAQUIN'S OPERATE THE ENHANCED. A HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE IN THE VALLEY. OF THAT SUBSIDY WOULD BE CUT IN HALF A DAD ABOUT FORTY ONE MILLION. FROM THE CURRENT EIGHTY ONE. A SO COSTS WOULD BE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN A MILLION AND A% TOTAL REVENUE WOULD COME IN ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE. OKAY THANK YOU. SO OF I THINK AND I THINK YOU ANSWERED THIS BUT I DIDN'T FULLY GATHERED SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF BUILDING THE PHASE ONE HOW MUCH OF THAT IS ACTUALLY BUILDING A TRAINED AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS OVERHEAD CONSULTANTS. AND THE LIKE THE- THE OVERHEAD CONSULTANT RELATED COSTS ARE- YOU KNOW RELATIVELY LOW WELL BELOW. BUT YOU KNOW. 10% OF PROJECT COSTS- YOU KNOW EFFECTIVE IN. EVEN MORE A CURRENT CONTRACT WITH OUR- A CONSULTANT THAT WAS ENTERED INTO BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. IS A SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR. CONTRACT AND- IN SO THAT- THAT'S A SEVEN YEAR- CONTRACTED AGAIN BURKE- YOU KNOW EXPONENTIALLY. THE THROUGH THAT IN- CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO IT'S A- RELATIVELY MINOR- COSTS OF THE OVERALL. THE PROJECT- TO GIVE YOU. YES I MEAN THE MAGITUDE OF IT IS WELL BELOW- CONSTRUCTION COSTS. I'M THANK YOU I MEAN I THINK. AS I LOOK AT ALL OF THIS AND THINK ABOUT WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND WHAT OUR CONSTITUENTS NEED AND WHAT WE NEED TO LEAD TO THE ECONOMIC I WITH THE RECOVERY THAT WE ARE NOW FACING AS A STATE- KNOWING. YOU KNOW THE AREA I REPRESENT THAT BORDERS CENTRAL VALLEY THE JOBS THAT WE'VE HEARD THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE AND IN THE BAY AREA IT IS WITHOUT QUESTION THAT I THINK CONNECTING THOSE AREAS INTO OUR URBAN CENTERS IS CRITICAL AND I DON'T SEE HOW THIS PROJECT ACCOMPLISHES THAT AND- THAT LEAVES ME PERPLEXED AND IT IN THE OPENING- IT WAS MENTIONED I THINK BY THE SECRETARY THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE THIS PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTION O THE VOTERS I THINK WE LONG AGO. LAUGHS WHAT THE VOTERS BELIEVED WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH THIS PROJECT WHEN THEY VOTED YEARS AGO- ON A NINE BILLION DOLLAR TRAINTHAT WOULD CONNECT FROM LA TO SAN FRANCISCO IN OUR BUILDING. JUST IN THIS PHASE A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR TRADE FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD. SO HEARING THAT YOU ANTICIPATE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS I HOPE IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE VOTERS TO RE EVALUATE. AND TO ASK THEM THE QUESTION ARE WE ON THE TRACK THEY WANTED US TO BE ON BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU SPEAKING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS. IT WE ARE NOT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF. MISTER KELLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO AND CHANGE UP A LITTLE BIT E HAVE A- WITNESS- DR BRIAN TAYLOR HAS TO AS OF A PRIOR COMMITMENT WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND GET HIM IN THE QUEUE- APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION IN PATIENTS. THANK YOU MODERATOR WOULD YOU PLEASE CONNECT DR BRIAN TAYLOR- DIRECOR UCLA IS TO TRANSPORTATION STUDY. BUT DOCTOR TAYLOR LINE IS OPEN. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME. HELLO IT TOOK A- OKAY GOOD. AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN FRAZIER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- IT'S AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY AND TO BE ALLOWED TO DO SO REMOTELY DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME THESE ARE INDEED UNUSUAL TIMES- I'M A PROFESSOR OF URBAN PLANNING A PUBLIC POLICY IN THE LEFT IN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTE TRANSPORTATION STUDIES THE UCLA. SEVEN SETTING AND PUBLISHING A TRAVEL BEHAVIOR AND TRANSPORTATION FINANCE PLANNING A POLICY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THAT I WORKED AS A TRANSPORTATION ANALYST IN THE BAY AREA. A PUBLISHED OVER TWO HUNDRED PIECES OF TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH AND 75% OF THOSE ARE REFEREED ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS. I WOULD HAVE TO COME HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT AN ASPECT OF MY TRAVEL BEHAVIOR RESEARCH RELATED TO TRANSFERS GENERALLY AND THE CONCEPT TO TRANSFER PENALTIES IN PARTICULAR. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE PROPOSED INCREMENTAL ROLL OUT OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PLAN WILL NECESSARILY ENTAIL MORE TRANSFERS THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE CASE OF A BILL THAT MY RESEARCH IN THIS AREA FOCUSED MERRILY ON ENTRAPMENT TRIPOLITAN TRAVELING NOT INTERMINABLE AND TRAVELS. TO THE UNDERLYING BEHAVIOR OUT THERE IS THE SAME. I SHOULD NOTE THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE NOT SPECIFIC TO PLANS FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. SO I DO HOPE THAT THE COMMITTEE FINDS THE MUSEUM THE DELIBERATION. FIRST SOME BACKGROUND A TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. THE INDIVIDUAL DEMAND FOR TRAVEL IS MOSTLY DERIVED FROM THE NEED OR DESIRE TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES LIKE WORKER SOCIALIZING. TO PAIN GOODS LIKE GROCERS ARE CLOSER- SERVICES LIKE MEDICAL CARE AMERICA. WELL THE EXPERIENCE IN RECENT WEEKS WHAT IT MEANS TO NOT BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE DEMAND IN THE HIGH SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC COSTS THEY CAN ENTAIL. SECOND WHEN PEOPLE TRAVEL THEY ENCOURAGE THREE SORTS OF COST. MONETARY COST. HI I'M COST AND RISK AND UNCERTAINTY COST. SEVEN DECIDING WHETHER TO GO OUT TO DINNER WE TRAVEL TO ANOTHER CITY. PEOPLE BALLOTS THE THREE KINDS OF COSTS TO GET THE BENEFITS OF THAT ACTIVITY GOOD OR SERVICE AT THE DESTINATION. AND THIRD ONCE ONE HAS DECIDED TO TRAVEL TO SAY A PHARMACY AN IMPORTANT STEP IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS CONCERNS MODE CHOICE. SHOULD I WALKED TO THE PHARMACY RIDE A BIKE OR SCOOTER TAKE A BUS OR STREETCAR LIFTER UBER. GET A RIDE FOR A FRIEND OR IF I HAVE A CAR SHOULD I DRIVE. DOWN BUT TRAVELERS TYPICALLY DO NOT GET A PENCIL AND PAPER AND WEIGH THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE TRAVEL MODE EACH TIME THEY TRAVEL. THEY DO MAKE THESE CALCULATIONS IN SOME MANNER. THE ONES TRAVEL CHOICES ARE MADE IN HABITS FORM. SUCH AS WHEN MOST PEOPLE DRIVE TO MOST DESTINATIONS. ARE MOSTLY BLIGHTED CITIES. THEY TEND NOT TO REVISIT THESE OPTIONS UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS TO MAKE THEM RETHINK THEIR CHOICES. THE SAME DECISION CREDIT- PROSTITUTES APPLY TO INNER CITY TRAVEL AND MODE CHOICE. SHOULD I DRIVE ALONE DRIVE WITH OTHERS TAKE A BUS TO TRAIN OR AIRPLANE. RIGHT THE TIME IN THE RICH CONCERT BECAUSE OF THESE VARIOUS OPTIONS ALL WEIGHED AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AS WELL AS FOR GOING THE TRIP OF THE COST YOUR DEEMED TOO HIGH. SO WHERE DID TRANSFERS COME INTO A LITTLE BIT. EXCEPT FOR TRAVELING SOMEWHERE BY FOOT VIRTUALLY ALL TRIPS ENTAILED SOME KINDS OF TRANSPORT. I MIGHT WALK TO MY CAR IN MY DRIVEWAY DRIVE TO THE PHARMACY AND WALKED TO THE PARKING AT THE STORE AND THAT ENTAIL TRANSFERS. I'M I WALK TO MY HOUSE TO RIDE YOU TAKE IT TO AN AIRPORT WALK THROUGH SECURITY TO THE GATE ONTO AN AIRPLANE. AND FLY TO CHICAGO CHANGED PLANES IN CHICAGO AND THEN FLY TO WASHINGTON DC. IN DC I WALK FROM THE PLANE TO DC METRO CHANGE TRAINS AND WALKED MY FINAL DESTINATION. AT THE LEAST EIGHT TRANSFERS WERE A LONG CROSS COUNTRY TRIP. RICHARD SHOWS THAT ADDITIONAL TRANSFERRED INCREASE THE OVERALL TRANSFER PENALTY MORE THAN PROPORTIONALLY. WHICH EXPLAINS WHY AIR TRAVELERS WILL PAY A PREMIUM FOR NONSTOP FLIGHTS. AND WHY SO FEW TRANSIT PASSENGERS WILL MAKE TWO OR MORE TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSES OR TRAINS ON THE GIVEN TRANSIT TRIP. FURTHER NEED COURSE TRANSFERS SUCH AS CHANGING PLANES ARE MOVING FROM ONE BUS TO ANOTHER TYPICALLY ENTAIL HIGHER TRANSFER PENALTIES OF THOSE MADE AT THE TRIP IN. THAT IS SUCH TRANSFERRED BEADED BY TRAVELER MORE HEAVILY THAN OTHER PARTS OF THE JOURNEY. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY RAISE A LOT OF QUESTIONS WHERE WILL I GET OFF THAT PLANE IN CHICAGO IS THE GATE FOR MY CONNECTING FLIGHT NEAR OR FAR STILL HAVE TIME TO MAKE THE SWITCH WHICH WAY DO I GO. WOULD HAVE MY FLIGHT IS DELAYED THE MY NECK AND CONNECTING FLIGHT IS NOT. THE MORE HALF TO UNCERTAINTY THE HIGHER THE TRANSFER PENALTY. THE RESURGENT PUBLIC TRANSIT WHICH I KNOW BEST SHOWS THE PASSENGERS. WEIGHT TRANSFER TIME AT ABOUT ONE AND A HALF. TO FOUR AND A HALF TIMES THE VEHICLE TIME. FOR ABOUT THREE TIMES GREATER ON AVERAGE. THAT IS TO AN AVERAGE TRAVELER WHO RIDE THE SUBWAY FOR TEN MINUTES. TRANSFERRED TO. WAIT TEN MINUTES FOR DIFFERENT TRAIN AND THEN RISE TWENTY MINUTES TO A DESTINATION. THAT TEN MINUTE TRANSFER IS CONSIDERED A BALLOT IS BURDENSOME IS THE ENTIRE THIRTY MINUTE SPENT RIDING THE TRAIN. THIS IN A NUTSHELL IS THE TRANSCRIPT AND- NINE MENTIONED IN THAT TRAIN PENALTY IS A- TO ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TO FOUR AND A HALF TIMES THE VEHICLE. BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEN MINUTE WAIT FEELING LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES GREAT TEN MINUTE WAIT FEELING BY FORTY FIVE MINUTES A LOT. SO IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE TO REDUCE TRANSFER THEM TO. MY COLLEAGUE HERO EFFECTIVE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND AYE ADAPTED MASS LAWS HIERARCHY OF NEEDS TO CREATE A TRANSFERRING PASSENGERS HIGHER THE KIDNEYS. BASED BOTH ON OUR OWN RESEARCH AND ON FINDING THE BEST IN THE STATE IS A REVIEW. AND THE FIGURE THAT I SUBMITTED SHOWS THAT. IN ITS HIERARCHY THE FIGURES THAT THE FACTORS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PYRAMID MUST ADDRESS BEFORE THE HIGHER RUNS BECOME MEANINGFUL. FOR EXAMPLE IF CONNECTING ON A COMMUTER TRAIN IS LATE OR IF THE EVENTUAL ARRIVAL OF THAT CONNECTING TRAINS UNCERTAIN. PASSENGERS ARE UNLIKELY TO FULLY APPRECIATE CLEAR SIGHTED YOUR COMFORTABLE SEAT AT THE BAR. SO WHAT IS THE HIGH. IF YOU'RE TRYING. WHETHER YOU'RE TRANSFERRING FROM ONE HIGH SPEED RAIL TO A BUS TO BE TRANSFERRING FROM AN AIRPLANE TO ANOTHER PLANE OF FROM A BUS TO THE SUBWAY. THE FIRST AND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS SAFETY AND SECURITY. THE QUICKEST WAY TO DRIVE AWAY PASSENGERS WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL UNSAFE. FOR ITS RISKY WHILE THEY'RE WAITING OR TRANSFERRING. THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT THING IS CONNECTIONS AND RELIABILITY. SEAMLESS CONNECTIONS AND RELIABLE AND ARRIVAL DEPARTMENT DEPARTURE TIMES ARE CRITICAL. WELL I DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE MISSED THAT OTHER FLIGHT TO THAT BACK TO THE LEFT JUST BEFORE WE WERE TO CATCH IT. IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING IN AND AGGRAVATE PASSENGERS IMMENSELY. THOSE FAMOUS. TIME TRANSFER YOUR ATTENTION. FOR IS THE PROCESS ACT THAT INFORMATION CHRIS CLEAR SIGN AND DIRECTIONS SHORT WALKS WITH THE TRANSIT. COMFORTABLE PLACES THE WAITER ALL CONNECTIONS AFTER THE CONNECTIONS ARE KEY TO MAKE THAT BETTER. AND THEN FINALLY IN FOR IT OUR AMENITIES LIKE CLEAN EASY TO FIND RESTROOMS WIFI FOOD DRINK PLACES TO SIT WHILE WAITING. THERE ARE NICE BUT ONLY IF THOSE FIRST THREE PACKAGES SATISFIED. SO TRANSFER IS NOT A TRANSFER IN MAKING IT DIFFICULT. SO OVERALL TRAVELERS WAY THE BURDEN OF TRANSFERRING MORE HEAVILY THAN OTHER PARTS OF THEIR TRIP. SO FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE TRAVELER THE FEW WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE BETTER. BUT NOT ALL TRANSFERS CAN BE AVOIDED IN RESEARCH POINTS IS THE WAY TO MAKE AT THAT BURDEN THE- FIRST FIFTEEN SECURITY THEN CONNECTIONS AND RELIABILITY. THEN ACCESS TO ACCOMMODATION AND THEN AMENITIES IN A NUTSHELL. MAKE TRANSFERS STATE RELIABLE INCOME. AND FIRST IN KEEP THEM TO OBEY MINIMUM THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE QUESTIONS OF DR TAYLOR. SEEING NONE THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATIVE. INFORMATION SIR AND WILL- BEFORE TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. NOW WILL GO ON A NINETY NINE UNDER BRANKO. I THOUGHT OF. MISTER KELLY CAN HEAR US I CAN'T HEAR YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW WITH YOUR PICTURE BUT WE'LL GO AHEAD AM WHAT WOULD MOVE ON MISTER PATTERSON. I THANK MISTER CHAIRMAN. MISTER KELLY WE HAVE BEEN HERE BE SEEMS NOT TOO LONG AGO THAT- WE WERE DISCUSSING THE DISARRAY THE INTERNAL CHAOS AS A RESULT OF THE AUDIT BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AUDITOR. OF THE INTERNAL CHAOS A- FOR ME LEADS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME VERY SERIOUS. INVESTIGATIONS MY QUESTION TO YOU IS HAVE YOU PERSONALLY OR HAVE ANY BOARD MEMBERS OR ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR YOU OR HAS WORKED FOR YOU BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION. I CERTAINLY AM NOT- I DON'T BUT THE GETTING MY- BOARD MEMBERS HAVE- AND BEYOND THAT I DON'T KNOW. SO PEOPLE WHO HAVE WORKED FOR YOU. BY THE AUTHORITY YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY IT BEING INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI. WELL I. MR PATERSON WHAT I CAN'T WHAT I CAN'T TELL YOU IS AYE I. DO DO NOT KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE SEEN THE LA TIMES STORIES- BUT I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THERE IS AN ACTIVE FBI INVESTIGATION GOING ON OR NOT ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO OUR PROGRAM. WHAT A DRY YOUR ATTENTION TO. SEPTEMBER. TWENTY TWENTY NINETEEN THIS IS A LAWSUIT AT- THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA THIS DEPOSITION NOW WAS PART OF A LITIGATION BETWEEN WEST PACIFIC ELECTRIC COMPANY. AND GATOS WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN HIGH SPEED RAIL. ON NINE SEPTEMBER TWENTIETH- MISTER ANDREW ERICKSON WAS ASKED BY THE PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY IF HE HAD BEEN. CONTACTED OR INTERVIEWED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES HIS ANSWER WAS. ARE THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION SAID THAT A CURVED UP SOMEWHERE IN MID TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ARM IN FURTHER QUESTIONING IN THIS DEPOSITION I HAVE THE DEPOSITION IF MEMBERS WISH TO SEE IT. THE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEY ASKED AGAIN FOR. ANY OTHER MEMBERS OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL. AUTHORITY WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH THE FBI. AND WITH MISTER ERICKSON. HIS ANSWER WAS YES. AND THAT THEY'RE IN THE PERSON. IDENTIFIED. WAS DIANA GOMEZ. I'M GONNA ASK YOU AGAIN HAVE YOU PERSONALLY OR ANY BOARD MEMBERS OR ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR YOU. OR WHO HAS WORKED FOR YOU. OR THE AUTHORITY. BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI. SIR PATTERSON I HAVE NOT BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION I KNOW OF NO BOARD MEMBER WAS BEEN INTERVIEWED BY THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION AND I THINK WHAT YOU MIGHT BE REFERENCING- IS AN INSPECTOR GENERAL OF NO SIR I'M GOING TO I'M GOING TO QUESTION YOU ON THAT IN A MINUTE. OKAY WHAT I AM TRYING TO DETERMINE IS HOW DOES THE CEO. YEAH OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY NOT KNOW THAT ANDREW ERICKSEN SEPTEMBER TWENTY OF TWENTY NINETEEN IN THE DEPOSITION OF WHICH I HAVE A COPY. WAS INTERVIEWED BY THE FBI AND ONE OF YOUR PRINCIPAL INDIVIDUALS. IN THE FRESNO AREA WHO IS THE FACE AND THE VOICE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. WAS IMPLICATED IN THAT ENQUIRING AND YOU ARE TELLING US YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT. WHAT I'M TELLING YOU MISTER PATTERSON IS THAT I KNOW THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WHO WORKS WITH US. ROUTINELY ON THE DOCUMENTS AND- MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS NO- WASTE BROADER ABUSE BECAUSE THIS FEDERAL MONEY ON THIS PROJECT- THAT WE HAVE INVITED THEM IN. A TO TRAIN OUR STAFF ON OF THOSE ISSUES TO ASSURE THAT WE- BEHAVE ACCORDINGLY- I KNOW THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS- MADE ENQUIRIES- SPOKEN WITH MS GOMEZ AND WHAT I DON'T KNOW WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE FBI. WAS WITH- WITH THEM ON THAT- I DO KNOW THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL- OFFICE HAS ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT- OF MISS GOVERNMENT. AGAIN I THINK YOUR ARE. OUT A- SICK. DISK OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IN THE INSPECTOR GENERAL. IS IT NOT TRUE THAT IT IS THE CRIMINAL DIVISION OF THE US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION'S INSPECTOR GENERAL. THAT IS AND ASKING THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS. YEAH I GET MISTER PATTERSON FORGIVE ME BUT I THINK YOUR- SUGGESTING THINGS THAT I CAN'T REALLY DO NOT KNOW TO BE TRUE THE REASON I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE IS. OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL DID CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF THE FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION AT THE REQUEST OF MISTER DENNIS. AND THE INSPECTOR GENERAL ON THE HEELS OF THAT REQUEST- DID GET IN CONTACT WITH US A TALK TO MY AUDITOR WHO THEY TALKED TO ROUTINELY MY INTERNAL AUDITOR- AND THEY DID ASK ME AND SHE ASKED ME IF WE'D BE INTERESTED IN HAVING THEM TRAIN OUR PEOPLE ON IDENTIFYING FREIGHT. OF WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE IN OUR CONTRACTING PROCESS IS TO WHICH I SAID YES AND WE INVITED THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN TO DO THAT. UP I. M. EARLY NOT TO. HERE ABOUT OTHER ELEMENT OF THIS INVESTIGATION OTHER THAN I DO KNOW THAT THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE- DID CONTACT DIANA GOMEZ- ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES- THAT THEY ASK- ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS ALL. AND I BELIEVE SHE HAD AN INTERVIEW WITH. BUT BEYOND THAT I CAN'T COME TO THE US AND I CERTAINLY- IT NOT AWARE OF THAT ANY OF THAT IS PART OF A- CRIMINAL INTO. A CRIMINAL. INTO THE I. G.'S OFFICE DO YOU I DON' THERE IS. OFFICE THE WHO DOES THE JOB WAIT WAIT. WASTE FRAUD IN THE- THEY SPOKE WITH MONTHS AGO AND THERE HAS BEEN NO COMMUNITY. IN WEEKS MONTHS UP WITH US. THOSE BUT I. G. BECAUSE THERE'S A BETTER MONEY I THIS PROJECT. IS ALWAYS PART OF THIS. YEAH I WOULD DUB SUGGESTED THE INTEREST IN THE I. G. HAS A AWFUL LOT DO WITH THE- BACK ON THE- MONEY AND- THEY- BEHAVE. THAT I TOOK PLACE IN THE UTILIZATION OF IT OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE SOUNDLY. CRITICIZED BY THE CALIFORNIA AUDITOR BUT THAT'S FOR ANOTHER TIME. DO YOU DO YOU DISPUTE. THE REPORTING IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES THAT IT IS THE CRIMINAL DIVISION. BUT YES BUT I GENERAL. THAT'S THE REPORTING ALL RIGHT SO DEALING I WOULD SAY IS THIS I HAVE NOT BEEN CONTACTED BY ANYBODY I KNOW TO BE PART OF THE CRIMINAL DIVISION THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE I DO KNOW THEIR INSPECTOR IN AUDIT UNIT HAS CONTACTED US. ABOUT FERRETING OUT WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE IN THE FEDERALLY FUNDED PROJECT- THAT WE HAVE ASKED THEM TO COME IN AND TRAIN OUR EMPLOYEES. AND I DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE. BECAUSE I DO THEM AS A PARTNER- I WELCOME THEIR PARTICIPATION. IN FIGURING OUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING A MESS AND SO WE HAVE HAD COMMUNICATION WITH THEM THEY'VE ASKED FOR DOCUMENTS THAT WE PROVIDED THEM AT EVERY TURN. THROUGH MY AUDITOR'S OFFICE- INTO YOUR COUNSEL'S OFFICE ABSOLUTELY BUT I DO NOT KNOW I TO BE SITTING HERE TODAY I COULD TELL YOU I DO NOT KNOW THAT THERE'S A QUOTE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. GOING ON BY ANY FEDERAL AND TO THE OF OUR OUR OUR TO BE CLEAR IT'S THE IT WAS REPORTED AS THE CRIMINAL DIVISION OF THE US DEPARTMENT. OF TRANSPORTATION. INSPECTOR GENERAL THAT THAT WAS THE REPORTING CAN YOU SPECIFICALLY. SITE ANY OUT. ACTIONS THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN ADMINISTRATIVELY OR AN OTHER WISE- AS A RESULT OF YOUR SO CALLED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL IN OTHER WORDS HAVE YOU FIRED PEOPLE HAVE YOU REMOVED PEOPLE HAVE YOU FOUND MALFEASANCE AND HAVE YOU ACTED ON IT. YEAH AGAIN- YOU KNOW THE FINDING ABOUT FEES AND SO I HAVE NOT THE CERTAINLY NOT DONE I WOULD SAY THIS UP. THERE ARE THERE HAVE BEEN NO PERSONNEL- COMPLAINS THAT WE HAVE. RESPONDED TO- AND I HAVE TAKEN MANAGEMENT ACTION- IN DEALING WITH THOSE- BUT AS THEIR PERSONNEL MATTERS IT'S REALLY NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON THAT IN ANY DETAIL HERE I WILL TELL YOU. THAT I HAVE HAD A CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL OVER THINGS LIKE THAT- BUT IN TERMS OF QUOTE. AND I'M JUST GONNA USE THE TERM BROADLY HERE QUOTE WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE- THERE IS NOTHING- THAT I'M AWARE OF FROM THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE THE UP WE ARE ANYBODY AS I'M SITTING HERE TODAY THAT- HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION. THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS ANSWER NOT CRIMINAL. YEAH ANY IN THE- AS TO WHEN OR IF. ARE THE INSPECTOR GENERAL WILL GIVE YOU ESSENTIALLY A CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH THAT YOU'RE DOING IT FINE NO I CANDIDLY DON'T BELIEVE THEY EVER WILL BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEIR JOB IN LIFE WHICH IS APPROPRIATE IS TO BE THE ENTITY THAT ASSURES FEDERAL DOLLARS ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. AND AGAIN MY INTERACTION WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE TODAY HAS BEEN MAKING SURE WE'RE GIVING THEM EVERY IN ANY DOCUMENT THEIR REQUEST AND THAT THEY TRAIN MY PEOPLE MY CONTRACT MANAGERS ON HOW TO IDENTIFY THOSE KIND OF PROBLEMS. AND THAT'S WHERE I'VE BEEN WITH THE INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE THE- YOUR TO FOR. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LOOK FRESNO AND SAID TO CALIFORNIA'S THE- BY THE MIDDLE OF THIS WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF A GUINEA PIG HERE. I NEED TO TELL YOU THAT MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED ALL KINDS OF INPUT. FROM WHAT AMOUNTS TO WHISTLE BLOWERS OTHER PEOPLE WHO. HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE OPERATIONS- HAVE REALLY BEEN SUSPICIOUS. I THINK THE REPORTING A MALE LOS ANGELES TIMES DEMONSTRATED- THAT SOME OF YOUR CONTRACTORS. OF LITERALLY- PRESSURED- SOME OF THE VERY PEOPLE THAT- THEY HIRED TO DO THE OVERSIGHT. INTO UP MAKING THINGS UP. AND THAT REPORTING. UP DO YOU DISPUTE. YES AND I WILL TELL YOU UP I'LL TAKE ZACH LEE MY VIEW ON THIS THE FIRST IS. YOU KNOW WHICH LA TIMES STORY YOU'RE REFERENCING- IS IT I'M NOT CERTAIN BUT I WILL SAY THIS I'VE CERTAINLY READ A STORY WHERE SOMEBODY AN EMPLOYEE OF A CONSULT NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF MINE- HAD SUGGESTED THAT SOMEHOW WE DON'T PUT ABOUT BAD NEWS. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THE DAY I READ THAT STORY I THOUGHT TO SAY THE LEAST THAT WAS IRONIC. BECAUSE SINCE I'VE BEEN HERE I PUT OUT A LOT OF BAD NEWS- I HAVE- IN THIS ORGANIZATION HAS OF COURSE VERY HARD TO BE CLEAR- AND TRANSPARENT ABOUT NOT JUST WHAT OUR OPPORTUNITIES ARE WHAT OUR CHAPTERS ARE. IN I. THE EIGHTEEN BUSINESS. THAT WE HAVE INCREASES IN SCHEDULE. THAT TO DO. I MEAN I. GOING TO INCREASE OUR TENDENCY TO DEAL WITH RISK. AND I HAVE PUT THE TWENTY DRAW BUSINESS PLAN THAT THERE ARE THERE'S A NEED TO PUSH OUT ARE VALID. TIME IN SO. ALL OF THOSE THINGS NONE OF THOSE ARE NEWS. ABOUT I HIM OUT BECAUSE MY JOB. AND I J. THIS FROM TO FIVE YEAR NOW WORK IN. THE PUBLIC'S IN THE- SO. IS THERE IS NO VALUE. IN KEEPING YOUR CHALLENGES INSIDE. THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THIS PROJECT PROJECT- I RESPECT THAT IMMENSELY- AND MY JOB IS TO PUT OUT EXACTLY WHAT ARE CHALLENGES. AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND TO FORM THE PUBLIC WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO ABOUT. IT SO THAT'S THAT'S HOW I OPERATE I WILL TELL YOU. THAT AND I THINK THIS WAS MADE CLEAR BEFORE- IN A PUBLIC SETTING THAT IS OUR BOARD HERE- I DO BELIEVE THAT. WITH RESPECT TO. A CLAIM FROM A CONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYEE. OTHER THAN CONTRACTOR HAS HIRED OUTSIDE FOR. A TO REVIEW THOSE COMPLAINTS. AND THAT INVESTIGATION OF THAT REVIEW IS STILL ONGOING- WHEN I'M OF ONE. BUT THANK. I WILL. CERTAINLY I ACCORDING. ON ANYTHING THAT I MUST. YEAH SO. I THINK IT'S A GENERAL CONCLUSION HERE BY MANY OF US ARE THAT THESE PREVIOUS BIT BUSINESS PLANS HAVE ESSENTIALLY I I'VE I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE MENTOR IN TERMS OF MAKING THINGS UP. AS YOU GO ALONG. UGH. WHAT KINDS OF CONCRETE SPECIFIC ACTIONS HAVE YOU TAKEN THAT WAS THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US THE KIND OF- CONFIDENCE THAT WHEN WE'RE HERE NEXT TIME AROUND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ALL KINDS OF CHANGES AND- RE EVALUATIONS AND RE CALCULATIONS. WELL I WOULD SAY TO YOU MISTER PATTERSON AS I DESCRIBED IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES THAT MAKE THEM HERE- BUT I HAVE- PERSONALLY TRANSFORM THE ENTIRETY OF THE- OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM- WE PUT IN A CULTURE OF. OF REALLY BEING MISSION FOCUSED- DOING THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE I THINK WE'RE SEEING THE AFFECTS OF THAT WHEN I. SHOW YOU THAT WHAT WE CALL THE A KPIS OF THE KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS THAT SHOW OUR WORK IS ADVANCING- LOOK I DON'T THINK IT'S A BIG SECRET AS TO WHY THIS PROJECT IS SET CHALLENGES. BUT WE GOT A NEW CONSTRUCTION BEFORE THE RIGHT AWAY WAS AND WE STILL NEED TO GET A LOT OF RIGHT AWAY IN THAT BECAUSE DELAY. AND COST INCREASES. AND I WAS VERY CANDID ABOUT THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN I REMAIN CANDID ABOUT THAT TODAY. MY JOB IS TO COME HERE AND TALK TO YOU ALL ABOUT OF WHAT THE- CHALLENGES- OF RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE. OF FOR THIS PROJECT. AND I A- YOU KNOW I AND ALL RIGHT SO I'VE MADE PERSONNEL CHANGES. WE'RE MAKING GOVERNANCE CHANGES A CONSTANTLY- WE PUT IN A COMMITTEE PROCESS TO EVALUATE A CHANGE ORDERS THEY COME ALL THE WAY UP TO MEET. ABOVE A CERTAIN LEVEL- AND I APPROVE THOSE IN A GENERALLY REPORT THOSE- TO OUR BOARD EVERY MONTH- WE HAVE PUT IN GREATER TRANSPARENCY- I THINK ANYBODY WHO WATCHES ARE FINANCING AUDIT COMMITTEE OR GOES THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE PROVIDE. A PUBLICLY EVERY MONTH OR FINANCE AND AUDIT COMMITTEE. CAN SEE EXACTLY WHERE THE CHALLENGES ARE- IN THIS PROJECT. WHAT WE'RE DOING WELL AND WHAT WE'RE NOT DOING WELL- IN SO ALL OF THAT IS PUBLIC ALTHOUGH THAT IS AVAILABLE. AND WHETHER I'M IN THIS BODY OR ANY OTHER BODY- MY POSITION IS TO ANSWER ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE VERY CANDID AND FORTHRIGHT WAY- I SEE AGAIN. NO VALUE IN TELLING YOU WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE A BY MY BEST VALUE WAS TELLING YOU WHAT THOSE ARE. THEY TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT. AND SO WE MAKE. CHANGE GOVERNANCE CHANGE. AND WE REPORT OUR A COST AND SCHEDULE ISSUES IN A WAY THAT IS I THINK IMPROVED. FROM PAST PRACTICE. WITH HER TO THE UP THE RISKS OF CLAWBACK HOW YOU ASSESS THIS. HAVE YOU MADE CONTINGENCY PLANS IF THE CALLED IF THE CLAW BACKS COME BACK AND I WOULD POINT THIS OUT IT WAS A CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. WHO RECOGNIZED THAT IT WAS A VERY RECKLESS DECISION. TO PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY FEDERAL MONEY OUT. BEFORE YOU HAD RIGHTS OF WAY HAD ANY. PROPERTY UPON WHICH- TO BUILD AND IT WAS. THE AUDITOR'S CONCLUSION. THAT OTHER THAT THAT DECISION OPENS SERIOUS RISK. OF PENALTIES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE THEIR CONTINGENCY PLANS IF YOU HAVE TO CALL BACK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS TO GIVE BACK BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WELL UP FIRST- I DO NOT SEE ANY BASIS FOR- CLAWBACK OF THE TWO POINT FOUR TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ARE OF FUNDS THOSE DOLLARS ARE SPENT. AND WE HAVE MATCHED- ROUGHLY 56% OF THOSE FUNDS NOW- AND- BY THE YEAR'S END THEY'LL BE FULLY MATCH THAN SO I SEE A NO BASIS FOR THOSE DOLLARS BECAUSE BACK AT ALL BUT SECONDLY WE ARE CHALLENGING VIGOROUSLY IN LITIGATION. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO TRY TO CALL BACK THE NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE MILLION THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN ACCESS YEAH- I THINK ULTIMATELY THE DECISION IS GOING TO BE MADE ON WHETHER OR NOT THOSE DOLLARS ARE. FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM CLAWBACK COUPLE- IS GOING TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE GOING TO BE. DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON THIS PROJECT. AND MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO DO THAT. IS TO- MAKE PROGRESS TO SHOW THAT WE ARE- HEADING TOWARD MEETING OUR FEDERAL OBLIGATIONS IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE- AND THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD. AN ADVANCING THIS PROJECT CONSISTENT WITH THE SPIRIT OF OUR FEDERAL MONEY GRANT AGREEMENT. AND THAT'S THAT'S MY PRIMARY OBJECTIVE. OF ANY TERMS OF CONTINGENCY PLANS- YOU KNOW IF THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS RIGHT NOW THAT HAVE COME IN AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION. DOLLARS A YEAR OF FOR THIS PROJECT SINCE CAP AND TRADE BEEN EXTENDED- IF THAT CONTINUES WE WILL BE ABLE TO FOR THE LOSS OF THE NOT TWENTY NINE. I THINK OKAY AND TRADE TO HIS TICKET FIVE EIGHTY EVERY YEAR FOR THAT TO HAVE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE CLEAR WITH THE- CAP AND TRADE IS PRESS. YEAH REVENUES ARE VOTER. IN THEM AND IN SO THOSE ARE THINGS WE WHILE. A VERY CLOSE IN TERMS OF A CONTINGENCY THERE'S OF TWO WE WOULD WE WOULD. OF YOU KNOW SO MORE FOR FROM SO ELSE OR PROBABLY MORE LIKELY WE WOULD REDUCE GO. OF THIS PROJECT IN EXACTLY HOW THEY WOULD DO THAT HOW WE WOULD DO THAT- YOU KNOW I'M NOT. A PUTTING OUT YET- TODAY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO COME TO THAT- BUT THOSE ARE THE OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE BEFORE. REDUCE THE SCOPE TAKE ON A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT APPROACH. TO HOW WE MOVED MOVE THIS FALL. AND SO. THOSE ARE THE TWO ARE ARE PRIMARILY PRIMARILY. THE OPTIONS BEFORE. I START I'M HEARING. TIME WILL TELL AS- THAT LEE IT WILL BE WHAT UP WITH A- TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE SO YOU'RE GOING TO. FULL TIME WILL TELL. WELL AGAIN I THINK WE'RE GONNA PREVAIL LITIGATION I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO DEEP THE ROLE RISK ANALYSIS ON ALL ELEMENTS OF THIS PROGRAM INCLUDING A WERE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS COME IN I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT- IN LIGHT OF THE COVERT NINETEEN A GLOBAL IMPACT ON A FINANCE IN THE ECONOMY- AND SO WE'RE GONNA WATCH VERY CAREFULLY WHAT HAPPENS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF OCTAVES. AND CERTAINLY IF YOU ARE RISK ASSESSMENT AND ARE DEEPER RISK ANALYSIS OF THESE KIND OF IMPACTS WE WILL REPORT FULL THROATED APPROACHES STORY TO THE LEGISLATURE- BY YEAR'S END. ONE FINAL QUESTION HAVE YOU PERSONALLY OR HAS ANY BOARD MEMBER OR ANYONE WHO WORKS FOR YOU. BEEN SUBPOENAED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. WANNA TALK VERY QUICKLY ABOUT. BEING RIPPED UP AND BEING RIPPED OFF WITH RESPECT TO ONE MORE THING. MY HOME HAS BEEN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. TWO TERM MAYOR OF THE AREA. I'VE KNOWN AND APPRECIATED. THE FOLKS IN OUR AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY AND OUR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND IN TALKING WITH EXISTING. PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR PROPERTY TAKEN THEIR. CROPS RIPPED OUT. ACCESS TO DECENT THE- WAYS OF GETTING AROUND THERE THE LEFTOVER PARTIALS I HAVE A LIST HERE THERE'S A HALF A DOZEN. OF FARMERS ON THIS LIST WITH ALL KINDS OF ISSUES. AND THEY BASICALLY FELL DOWN TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. HAS TAKEN A PROPERTY HAS MADE LIFE LIFE DIFFICULT FOR THEM THEY CANNOT GET THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE OWED. THAT THE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF STAFF MEMBERS. AND PLENTY OF MONEY TO BUILD STUFF. BUT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE THE WILLINGNESS OR OR THE STAFFING OR THE ATTORNEYS. TO DO JUSTICE TO THESE. FARMERS. MY QUESTION IS DID DOES DOES IT CONCERN YOU. DOES IT BOTHER YOU THAT YOU ARE HEADING AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS REALLY MADE LIFE MISERABLE FOR SOME OF THE FINEST PEOPLE. IN OUR AREA. AND I HEAR FROM THEM MISTER KELLY YOU MAY NOT. BUT I DO OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT THAT. MISTER PATTERSON LET ME START WITH THE LIST THAT YOU HAVE. WE WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME THAT LIST AND WE WILL GO THROUGH A CASE BY CASE AND REVIEW THOSEISSUES AND I'M HAPPY TO OR GO THROUGH IT AND REPORT BACK TO THE FACTS ON DIGITAL SIX AND I WANT TO TELL YOU I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY HOW SENSITIVE IT'S FOR SOMEBODY- TO WORK WITH US TO GIVE UP PRIVATE PROPERTY- FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT OF THIS PROJECT BUT I ALSO WANT TO SAY. THE NET BENEFIT OF THIS PROJECT IN THAT REGION TO ME IS CLEAR. BUT WE HAVE BEEN A HUGE PART. OF EMPLOYMENT GAINS IN THAT. AREA OF THE STATE THE THAT HAS BEEN OF FOR A LONG TIME HIGHLY DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT COMES ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND WE HAVE PROVIDED MASSIVE OPPORTUNITY I COULD BE PROUD. OF THE FACT THAT I PUT OUT YOU KNOW MORE THAN THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED- WORKERS DISPATCH TO THIS PROJECT THESE ARE GOOD PAYING. HIGH PAYING JOBS THAT COULD SUSTAIN FAMILIES. IN THERE'S NO WHERE I'M HAPPIER THAT WE'RE DOING. THEN IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. A IT IS A PASSION OF MINE. TO MOVE FROM DIESEL EMISSION. A TECHNOLOGIES CHECK CLEAN ELECTRIFY TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE THE AIR CONDITION THE AIR QUALITY THAT READ THE PUBLIC HEALTH. SO ALSO WITH THE LIST THAT YOU HAVE. A IT IS A VERY SENSITIVE MATTER ON DEALING PEOPLE WITH DEALING WITH PEOPLE AND THEIR PROPERTY. AND I WILL GO THROUGH IT ONE BY ONE BE WITH YOU THESE ARE ALL JUST MISSED KELLY THESE ARE ALL IN THE PROCESS FOR YEARS. YOU WOULD KNOW WHAT THESE INDIVIDUALS. BUT I WILL TELL YOU IN TALKING TO MY FRIENDS. THAT THEY ARE ASKING ME TO KEEP THESE. CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE THEY FEAR RETRIBUTION. BY THE STAFF AND THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE PUT IN CHARGE. OF THESE OF. PAYING THESE PEOPLE WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GET WHAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS PROMISED TO GIVE THEM AND CONTINUES TO USE EXCUSES AND PEOPLE CAN'T TALK TO PEOPLE THAT CAN MAKE DECISIONS YOU CAN DECIDE TO THROW CONCRETE. BUT YOU CAN'T DECIDE TO PAY THESE PEOPLE. MISTER PATTERSON I'M OFFERING TO HELP- AND I'M OFFERING TO HELP WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE ORGANIZATION- AND SO AGAIN I'LL DO THAT. OF WHENEVER YOU WANT AND I WOULD JUST SAY WE WILL BEGIN I DO NOT I DO NOT- WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY- THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF. OF GOING TO THE EMINENT DOMAIN PROCESS THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PROCESS IS GUIDED BY LAW. AND SOMETIMES IN THAT PROCESS PARTICULARLY NEGOTIATED PART OF. IT'S IN THE- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES SOMETIMES EOPLE WANT MORE THAN WE CAN LEGALLY GIVE THEM IT'S A WE HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES BUT WHAT WE DO- THEM AT ALL TIMES IT'S CLEAR COMMUNICATION ON WHERE IT STANDS WHERE WE ARE WHAT WE CAN OR CAN'T DO IF THEY HAVE NOT RECEIVED THAT I APOLOGIZE THAT. THE TO YOU THESE ARE. OWNED REVENUE. THESE END OF MAY OR MAY NOT WANT TO DO THIS BUT- IF THEY WOULD WANT TO ADD AS A GROUP WOULD YOU AGREE TO COME TO FRESNO AND HEAR THEIR COMPLAINTS WITH ME. YES I'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT WHETHER THEY- ARE WILLING TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEIR TRUST LEVELS IN YOUR OPERATION ARE VERY VERY LOW BUT LET ME SEE WHAT I MARKET I WORK EVERY DAY TO IMPROVE THAT EVERY DAY WELL WE ALL HOPE SO. THANK YOU IF. MS FRIEDMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I APPRECIATE YOUR- PUTTING THIS- HEARING TOGETHER AND YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OF MISTER KELLY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AS WELL I HAVE SOME COMMENTS FOR FIRST I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU BASED ON YOUR PRESENTATION- I AM AND I AND I. I'M SORRY IF I MISSED THE SOMEWHERE IN THE DOCUMENTATION BUT WHEN THE PROJECT IS COMPLETED AND RUNNING MY SIMPLY THAT I MEAN THE SECTION OF THE PROJECT NOT THE ENTIRE PROJECT SO ONE MERCED BAKERSFIELD SECTION IS COMPLETE AND ELECTRIFIED- ARE YOU WILL AMTRAK STILL BE RUNNING. CONCURRENTLY ALONG EITHER THIS RAIL OR ANOTHER SECTION OF RAIL THROUGH THIS AREA. THE PROPOSED A PLAN RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY WOULD NOT- THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD EXCLUSIVELY RUN SOUTH OF COURSE AT. A TO BAKERSFIELD BUT I MUST SAY THAT THAT. THAT DETERMINATION IS GOING TO BE PART OF AN OPERATING. OR MO YOU AGREEMENT ON HOW- WE WOULD ULTIMATELY WORKED OUT BUT BUT THEY HAVE. A THE PLAN RIGHT NOW IS A THERE WAS CERTAINLY NO NO MORE THAN SEVERELY REDUCED- SERVICE BUT RIGHT NOW THE INTENTION IS FOR US TO RUNS OUT THE PERCENT. AT THE BAKERSFIELD FOR THEM TO RUN A NOR. DO THEY HAVE TO AGREE TO THAT. A YEAH BEALL TO BILLY THIS IS GONNA BE AN OPERATION THAT THEY ARE IN CHARGE WE'RE GONNA BE ASSET OWNERS- OWNING THE ASSETS. OF A WILL LEASE THE ASSETS FROM US- TO OPERATE A HIGHER SPEED ELECTRIFIED SERVICE- IN THAT VALLEY- SO BUT YEAH I DON'T REDO IT'S GOT TO BE REALLY PART OF THEIR- BROADER OPERATIONAL PLAN. I THINK SOME OF THIS IS. UP OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE SAN JOAQUIN'S- JPA I THINK IS INTERESTED IN- IN. FINDING OTHER EFFICIENCIES LIKE A SINGLE OPERATOR FOR ALL OF THE SYSTEMS THAT THEY MAY. A CONTRACT FOR AND AGAIN OUR MODEL HERE IS THAT WE'RE ASSETS OWNER ASSET OWNERS- BUT THEY WOULD BE THE ONES TO DO- THE- OF THE OPERATING ELEMENTS- THROUGH. AN AGREEMENT WITH US TO PAY. AT LEAST FOR ACCESS- BUT THEN THEY WOULD- OF WORKING THROUGH THE- OPERATING ELEMENTS. THANK YOU- THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE BUT I AM GONNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS AFTER LISTENING TO. THE PRESENTATIONS TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE PRESENTERS IN THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE STAFF FOR A VERY. IN DEPTH ANALYSIS. AND I WOULD- ALSO ASSOCIATE MY COMMENTS WITHOUT MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE ANALYSIS RAISES- AND THERE ARE MANY AND I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE MALL. BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS THAT ARE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT DO NEED TO BE- REALLY ADDRESSED- YOU KNOW A FEW THINGS THAT I HEARD TODAY I. KIND OF STRUCK ME- ONE WAS- FROM- SECRETARY KIM WHO. MENTIONED I THINK AT LEAST ONCE MAYBE MORE THAN ONCE THAT WE WERE ABANDONING ELECTRIFICATION AND OR THAT THERE IS A PROPOSAL TO ABANDON ELECTRIFICATION. AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS SOMEONE WHO'S READ THOSE WITH THOSE IDEAS AS OPTIONS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS TALKED ABOUT ABANDONING ELECTRIFICATION THERE HAS BEEN TALK ABOUT. HOW WHAT ON WHAT SCHEDULE THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND I THINK THERE'S A VERY BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAYING THAT. SOMEHOW WE WOULD DO HIGH SPEED RAIL IN THE END GOAL WILL BE TO NOT ELECTRIFY IT. AS OPPOSED TO. A CONCEPT OF COMPLETING DIFFERENT PHASES OF THIS PROJECT- AND LEAVING ELECTRIFICATION- FOR LATER AFTER AS YOU AS YOU'VE HEARD THE PROPOSAL THAT I HAVE MADE AND OTHERS HAVE MADE. TO SHIFT TO THE ELECTRIFICATION MONEY INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE pBACK TO ELECTRIFY THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND THE REASON THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I WILL SAY IS SOMEONE WHO IS. CONTINUES TO BE A SUPPORTER OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA AND THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT THAT MY BIGGEST FEAR ONE OF MY BIGGEST FEARS FOR THIS PROJECT. IS THAT WE CONTINUE WITH THE DOWN THE PATH THAT WERE ON. AND COMPLETE TO THE PROJECT AS YOU'VE HAD THE OUTLINED IT. I THIS ONE SECTION OF THE PROJECT IN THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS. DON'T MATCH. THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT YOUR- ANTICIPATING IN YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. AND THAT WE WILL HAVE TO BE SEEN TO HAVE SPENT REALLY IN IN. HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY WHAT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF MONEY ON A SINGLE PROJECT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS EVER DONE. AND A RIDERSHIP NUMBERS FALL SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT'S BEEN PROJECTED AND THE PROJECT STOPS AT THAT POINT. AND WE END UP WITH. WHAT YOU COULD THINK OF IS A BIT OF AN ORPHAN PROJECT WITH THE ENTIRE PROJECT IS NEVER COMPLETED. I STILL DO SOME MORE ANALYSIS OF THE ALTERNATIVE. OF INSTEAD OF ELECTRIFYING OUT OF WORKING ON THE PROJECTS THAT- IN THE NORTHERN IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE THAT WOULD THEN LINK. THE CENTRAL VALLEY TO THE BAY AREA. AND A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. INTO THE POPULATION AREAS WHERE WE WERE I BELIEVE WE WOULD HAVE A- BIGGER INCREASE IN RIDERSHIP IN THOSE AREAS TO SHOW THAT THERE IS PUBLIC DEMAND. FOR ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION AND FOR RAIL TRANSPORTATION. THEN I BELIEVE THAT IT'S EASIER TO JUSTIFY CONTINUING INVESTMENT IN THE PROJECT. WHICH YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO ANYWAY BUT IF YOU COMPLETE THIS SECTION. YOUR RIDERSHIP FALLS BELOW EXPECTATIONS AND I THINK WILL BE VERY HARD. TO GO BACK TO THE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AND ASK THEM FOR A LARGE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL. YOU INVESTING IN THE PROPER. SOME OF THE OTHER ASSERTIONS THAT I HEARD WAS YOU KNOW A SECRETARY KIM WHEN HE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT GHG REDUCTIONS ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION SECTION SECTOR BEING WITH THE ONE AREA WHERE WE KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WITH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THAT'S ALL TRUE BUT WE DON'T GET REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION BY SWITCHING FROM DIESEL TO ELECT A LECTURE CALL WE GET SOME SMALL AMOUNT. WE GET ACTIONS AND GROUP HOUSE GASES BY GETTING PEOPLE OF AUTOMOBILES ON TO TRAINS THAT'S WHERE YOU REALLY GET THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS AND I AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO. DO A LOT MORE ANALYSIS ON THESE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THEY ARE BASED ON MULTIPLE TRIPS PER DAY IN THE SYSTEM WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING THE AMOUNT OF TRAINS PER DAY. THAT YOU'RE BASING YOUR RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ON. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FULLY EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF TRANSFERS ON RIDERSHIP NUMBERS AND WE'VE HEARD WE HEARD TODAY FROM. OF DR BRIAN TAYLOR FROM UCLA ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TRANSFERS. A GIVEN THAT WERE STILL UNCLEAR ABOUT. WHAT THE TRANSFERS WILL MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW MANY TRAINS A DAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO TRANSFER TO- THE SPEED OF THOSE TRAINS. ALL OF THAT IS STILL VERY UNCLEAR. I THINK THAT WE NEED TO AT THIS POINT HAVE A BIT OF A PAUSE FOR WE ARE VALUE WAIT BILL. REALLY SHINE A MICROSCOPE ON THOSE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS AND ON THE- BASIS BY WHICH- THEY WERE CALCULATED AYE I ASKED A LOT OF QUESTIONS IN THE LAST HEARING THAT WE HAD WHEN WE ALL MET. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I GET A LOT OF WHAT I THOUGHT WERE SATISFACTORY ANSWER OF WHERE SOME OF THOSE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WERE BEING GENERATED FROM AND I'M NOT THAT THE ACTION STILL. ARE IS TRUE RIGHT NOW IS THEY WORK THE TERM. I KNOW I WOULD TO SEE YOU KNOW A MORE DRILL DOWN ON THAT- GIVEN THE CURRENT CONFIGURATION OF THE PROJECT THE TIME TABLE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND LOOKING TO SEE IF THOSE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE STILL JUSTIFIED. BECAUSE AGAIN I AM CONCERNED ABOUT- THE- THE NEXT STEP OF TRYING TO GET THE NEXT ROUND OF FUNDING AFTER THIS TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT. YEAH I IF WE HAVE A PROJECT THAT ONLY RUNS FOR MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD YOU KNOW YOU SURE THAT'S NOT HORRIBLE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT WAS TOLD TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY WERE INVESTING IN WHEN THEY VOTED FOR THIS PROPOSITION THEY WERE VOTING FOR A SYSTEM THAT GOES UP AND DOWN THE STE FULL STATE OF CALIFORNIANS CERTAINLY INTO THE BAY AREA. AND I WOULD ARGUE YOUR OWN RIDERSHIP NUMBERS ARE BASED ON GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE BAY AREA NOT JUST BETWEEN NOT JUST THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY AS FAR AS I SEE IT AND I COULD BE I MEAN IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT PLEASE CORRECT. MY CONCERN SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. OF A FULL REPORT FROM YOU ON RIDERSHIP NUMBERS- BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TRIPS PER DAY THE YOU'RE YOU'RE ANTICIPATING AT THIS POINT ON THE DESTINATIONS. ON WHATEVER WHATEVER OTHER OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. I THINK THAT WE NEED THAT- WE DESERVE THAT BEFORE WE GO FORWARD AND WE DON'T WE ALSO SHOULD HAVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE RIDERSHIP NUMBERS WILL BE ON CLEANER THIRD GENERATION DIESEL FAST TRAINS- WITH YOUR NEW RULE- NEW TRACKS SO RATHER THAN LOOKING AT RIDERSHIP NUMBERS THAT ARE- SIMPLY EMPTY. VERSUS HIGH SPEED RIGHT OF THIS WHAT OTHER OPTION OF A SINGLE SEAT RIDE FROM BAKERSFIELD ALL THE WAY UP TO THE BAY AREA VERSES THE HIGH SPEED RAIL LECTER FIGHT HAVING TO CHANGE TRAINS I THINK THAT'S REALLY THE COMPARISON OF RIDERSHIP THAT WE NEED TO SEE- BEFORE WE DECIDE ON WHAT THIS INVESTMENT- SHOULD BE GOING FORWARD. WORK CRUCIAL STAGE IN THIS PROJECT AND WHAT WE DO NOT IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE BEAR ON THE- OF THIS PROJECT AND HOW. PLEASE PEOPLE IN TEN FIFTEEN YEARS LOOK BACK ON THE INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET THIS WRONG. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING. THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING OF AT THIS POINT AND HOW EVERY DOLLAR THAT'S SPENT IS GOING TO BE SCRUTINIZED. THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR GOING FORWARD WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN JUST BY EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR AND WHERE THOSE INVESTMENTS GO. AND I WOULD STILL ARGUE THAT THERE'S A BIG CASE TO BE MADE FOR INVESTING MORE IN. LAYING THE FUTURE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN OUR POPULATION CENTERS WHILE ALSO ENJOYING THE CO BENEFITS. OF HAVING MUCH BETTER IMPROVE SERVICE FOR. RELATIONS CENTERS. AND GETTING A LOT MORE PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR CARS- AND- GETTING PEOPLE THEMSELVES DEMAND. BETTER TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITHOUT I WILL YIELD MY TIME BACK IN THANK YOU AND- A MISTER CHAIR. MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY FOR BEING HERE. I JUST HAD SOME QUESTIONS DIRECTED AT THE POTENTIAL LEGAL RISKS THAT THIS PROJECT MIGHT BE FACING- IN PARTICULAR. WHETHER CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS PLAN MIGHT CONFLICT WITH THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE OF. THE PROP ONE A BOND ACT THAT WITH THE VOTERS APPROVED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- AND I WANT TO START BY READING- QUOTING FROM. TWO SECTIONS OF PROPOSITION ONE A- OF THE BOND ACT. THAT AUTHORIZED. ENDING STATE BONDS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL- ONE SECTION SAYS QUOTE THE PLAN PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY. OR PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY. WILL NOT REQUIRE OPERATING SUBSIDY. A SUBSEQUENT PASSAGE STATES THAT OF A PARTIAL SEGMENT ACCORD OR IS TO BE BUILT THEN QUOTE THE PLANNED A PASSENGER SERVICE BY THE AUTHORITY IN THE CORRIDOR OR USABLE SEGMENT THERE OF. WILL NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL STATE OR FEDERAL OPERATING SUBSIDY. THAT APPEARS TO ME TO BE A FAIRLY EXPLICIT BAN ON TAXPAYER OPERATING SUBSIDIES. SO MY FIRST QUESTION OF YOU TODAY IS WILL THE PLANNED INITIAL SEGMENT FROM ARE SAID TO BAKERSFIELD. REQUIRE AN ONGOING OPERATING SUBSIDY FROM THE TAXPAYERS YES OR NO. YES BUT LOWER THAN WHAT THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING TODAY. DOES THAT CAUSE CONCERN FOR YOU OR YOUR LAWYERS THAT ARE ADVISING YOU THAT IF. AS YOU JUST SAID IT WILL REQUIRE AN OPERATING SAYS SUBSIDY DOES THAT DOES THAT NOT CONFLICT WITH THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE I JUST READ FROM THE PROPOSITION ONE A BOND. I DON'T THINK SO I THINK SO MISTER CUNNINGHAM OF THE REASON THAT WE DON'T THINK SO IS BECAUSE- UNDER THE MODEL THAT WE'RE USING THE VALLEY WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR- WE WOULD WE ALL WE ALL THE ASSETS. THAT WOULD BE LEAST BY ANOTHER PUBLIC ENTITY WHO WILL CONTRACT WITH AN OPERATOR- TO RUN THE SYSTEM. AND SO- THAT IS NOT- OPERATED BY US AND JUST. I THINK PROVIDE A FAIR. SORT OF COMPARISON HERE ON SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. BUT IN CALIFORNIA BOTH WITH THE- RECOGNITION AND EVEN THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE. IS YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE USE PROP ONE EIGHT DOLLARS- TO ELECTRIFY THE SEGMENT. OF THE CALTRAIN CORD OR THE BAY AREA- BUT- THE INCUMBENT OPERATOR IS OPERATING ON THAT SYSTEM. BUT NOT US- IN SO- IN THAT CASE WERE USING PROP ONE EIGHT DOLLARS TO ELECTRIFY. A SEGMENT IN THE BAY AREA TO PROVIDE ELECTRIFIED SERVICE PROVIDED BY ANOTHER- AND THAT'S NOT A VERY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE ARE. PROPOSING THE CELL IN THE- IN THE ABSENT ABOUT. SO IT DOES NOT BECAUSE YOU OR YOUR LEGAL TEAM CONCERNED THAT THE- PROP ONE A BOND ACT LANGUAGE SAYS- TRAIN SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY. FOR PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY. SO IF YOU'RE YEAH I THINK THAT REFERENCE TO PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY- AND I'M YOU KNOW I'M NOT A LAWYER- BUT I THINK IT IS A REFERENCE TO. A SECTION OF LAW THAT SAYS YOU KNOW THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS SORT OF OUR MODEL FORTY UP UNDER THE- CALIFORNIA STATUTES FOR ANY DRAIN SERVICE OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR. SO I THINK THAT'S THE REFERENCE THERE- BUT AGAIN IT'S WE'RE NOT RELYING ON THAT AUTHORITY TO. PROVIDE SERVICE HERE WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS- WE'RE GONNA BILLS OF ASSETS THAT ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE TO PUT INTO USE A RELATIVELY SOON. UP AND- THROUGH A- WITH THAT EXISTING PROVIDER THOSE ASSETS CAN ELECTRIFIED THAT PROVIDE. I CAN'T PROVIDE SERVICE ON THAT SYSTEM WHICH AGAIN IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE AREA WITH A CALTRAIN. OKAY IT DOES NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE TEAM SOME STERN THE- THIS COULD BE VIEWED AS A WORK AROUND AROUND THE EXPLICIT LANGUAGE OF THAT I JUST READ OF. THE AUTHORIZING BOND ACT BECAUSE YOU'RE SAYING WELL. WE'RE GOING TO CONTRACT WITH THE THIRD PARTY AND LET THE THIRD PARTY OPERATED THEREFORE WE CAN USE TAX- SUBSIDIES TO OPERATE IT. I AND I WOULD NOTE YEAH THAT YET AGAIN TO BE FAIR SICKENING TAXPAYERS ARE SUBSIDIZING. THE SAN JOAQUIN SERVICE TODAY. THAT A DIESEL SERVICE AT THE JUNE OF EIGHTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND WHAT WHAT WE ARE NUMBERS SHOW THAT IF- WORKING WAS SAN JOAQUIN'S TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE ELECTRIFYING THAT SECTION. AND THEM AS OPERATOR OR OTHER PUBLIC ENTITY WHO IS A CONTRACTING WITH THE OPERATOR. OF PROVIDING THAT SERVICE IS NOT A QUIRK AROUND IT'S IN COMPLIANCE WITH PROP ONE DAY WAS THAT AND SO WITH NATURAL IN COURT DO YOU HAVE A LEGAL OPINION THAT SAYS THAT THAT WAS- CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE IN THE BOND ACT. IT IS NOT A- IT'S NOT JONES. SO I. THAT THIS THIS NEW PLAN WILL GET CHEN AND WORRY ABOUT THA BECAUSE TODAY THERE WAS AN LA TIMES ARE. WORK KOPP. OF FORMER STATE SENATOR A RETIRED JUDGE. WHO WAS THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL BOARD OF DIRECTORS. HE SAID INTO THE LA TIMES TODAY AND I QUOTE IT DEFIES THE BALLOT MEASURE APPROVED BY VOTERS. AND YOU ALSO SAID THERE WILL BE A LAWSUIT AND I WANT TO BE THE LEAD PLAINTIFF. I THINK YOU'VE GOT A POTENTIALLY CHALLENGE COMING AND SO THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS BUSINESS PLAN. AND A COURT RULES AGAINST THE AUTHORITY THAT. THE BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED LINE IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE BOND FUNDS WOULD WOULD YOU HAVE% WHAT WHAT HAPPENS THEN DO YOU HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN. I MEAN THERE'S A LOT IF THEY'RE- IN AGAIN WE FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE NOT WAS STANDING WITH. A JUDGE COP. AHEAD IS A I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH HE KNOWS ABOUT THE- STRUCTURE OF THE- OF THE PROGRAM IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THE IDEA THAT WE ARE NOT THE OPERATOR I THINK THAT'S A- AN IMPERATIVE POINT. I THINK THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL OF THIS- SO- YOU KNOW I DO I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW. SORT OF- IF THERE ARE YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE. LOOK THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF LEGAL CHALLENGE OVER THE YEARS- LEGAL CHALLENGE ABOUT HOW IT WAS BEING SPENT HAS BEEN APPROPRIATED. ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES AND- YOU KNOW WE WORK THROUGH THEM- WHICH SETTLED ALL LITIGATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL FRONT TODAY. AND WE BUILT ON CIVIL COURT WHICH IS. A TODAY OF. UP THERE IS THAT WE'RE FOR SO I HAVE A CONTINGENCY PLAN TO MY BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I'M NOT SURE WE NEED TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD I. WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE. MEETING THE LETTER OF THE LAW CERTAINLY A PROP ON A. AND THAT THIS MODEL BY THE WAY. NOT A MODEL THAT THEN PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE INTO TODAY EXIT AM LEASES TRACKS FRIGHT. THE ACE LEASE TRACK FROM RAIL OTHERS THE SAME ALL THE DENTIST CAL IN THIS CASE WE ARE BILL. THOSE TRACKS WE OWE THAT THE OPERATIVE FOR THEM TO LEAST THAT AND THE OPERATE SPEED RAIL SERVICE AN INTERN MATTER AND WE GET BUILD A SYSTEM THAT WE DESN'T REQUIRE. THE SUBSIDY AND THEN WE WILL BECOME A MORE DIRECT OPERATOR IN SO IT'S AN INTERIM SERVICE AND AGAIN THIS MODEL IS BEING EXECUTED OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE TODAY. SO WHAT I'M HEARING FROM ME THOUGH IS THAT WHILE WE'RE DOING IT IN OTHER PLACES SO IT MUST BE CORRECT BUT YOU JUST SAID THAT IT'S NEVER BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT BEFORE AND OF THIS TYPE OF LEGAL CHALLENGES DIFFERENT THAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWSUIT THIS GOES TO THE FUNDAMENTAL. VOTERS BUT THEY WERE. TOLD HAPPEN AND WHAT THE TOLD WOULD HAVE INTO EIGHT WHEN THEY VOTE. TO ENACT THE PROP ONE A BOND ACT. TO BUILD THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IS THAT TAXPAYER MONEY WOULD NOT BE USED FOR OPERATING SUBSIDY. THAT'S AT LEAST AS I READ THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OR SO I SUGGEST YOU HAVE A LAWSUIT COMING. SO YOU MAY WANT TO COULD DEVELOP A CONTINGENCY PLAN. FOR BECAUSE IN MY VIEW AS AN ATTORNEY AND IN THE VIEW OF CLINTON COP WHO WAS AFTER ALL THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS- YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM. ON THE LEGAL AND- OF I DON'T KNOW WHICH LAWYERS YOU'RE TALKING TO BUT I THEY SHOULD BE TELLING YOU YOU GOT A PROBLEM. SO THE OTHER THING YOU COULD DO IS GIVEN THE LEGAL UNCERTAINTY AND THEREFORE THE LEGAL RISK AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THIS IS IN A SMALL THING. ARE YOU COULD FIRST SEEK LEGAL CLARIFICATION EITHER FROM THE COURTS. FOR LEGISLATIVE CLARIFICATION AS TO THE INTENT OF THE BOND LANGUAGE BECAUSE AFTER ALL IT WAS THE LEGISLATURE THE PUT THE BOND ON THE BALLOT. AND WE HAVE A BILL THAT WE JUST MOVED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT WOULD. CLARIFY THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT. AND WHAT IT WOULD SAY IF IT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. IS UP THAT THIS LANGUAGE MEANS WHAT IT SAYS AND YOU CAN'T DO A WORK AROUND BY PUTTING SOMEONE ELSE'S DECALS ON THE TRAIN. AND SAY THAT THERE THE OPERATOR. UP SO. I YELP FORTUNATELY I REMEMBER FIRST. SORRY WELL I MEAN TO BE TOTALLY CANDID I MEAN. YOU KNOW. IT IT AT MY CENTRAL CO NOBODY'S EVER AYE THIS ALL PAY FOR FOREVER THE- AS OTHER QUESTIONS APPOINT OUT THE CO OVER ON THIS. OR STAFF. AND ONYX THE SCOPES BEING SCALED DOWN THE COST GOES UP EVERYTIME WE TURN AROUND- I WOULD BE PERFECTLY CONTENT AS WITH MOST OF MY CONSTITUENTS IF YOU LOST THIS LEGAL CHALLENGE. BUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN MAKING IT WORK I THINK YOU NEED TO DRILL DOWN ON THESE ISSUES OR LET THE LEGISLATURE TAKE THE LEAD IN CLARIFYING THE LAW MEANS ORGANIT. THE CLERK JUDGMENT FROM THE COURT THAT SAYS THAT YOU CAN PROCEED IN A MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE BOND ACT BECAUSE I PERSONALLY DO NOT BELIEVE YOU'RE DOING THAT. I THINK THOSE OP OR OPTIONS WE- WE MAY CONSIDER. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME SIR APPRECIATE. YOU. THE REVERSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AND THANKS TO BOTH SECRETARY CAM AND TO YOU- MISTER KELLY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND ALSO FOR ENGAGING WITH US AS LEGISLATORS YOU KNOW THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO RESPOND- TO AN END QUESTION OF THE PROPOSED DRAFT OF THE BUSINESS PLAN AND BY ASKING QUESTIONS- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE'RE TURNING OUR BACK ON THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IN OUR YOU KNOW THAT ARE VOTERS APPROVED- BUT WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE PROJECT DOES PROVIDE THE MOST OVERALL BENEFIT TO OUR STATE IN ON TO OUR CONSTITUENTS I'M ESPECIALLY BY REPLACING AUTUMN WILL AUTOMOBILE TRIPS BY PASSENGER RAIL TRIPS RIGHT WHICH IS THE OVERALL GOAL LIKE- MY COLLEAGUE MS FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP EARLIER AND SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO COMMENT ON THAT- BUT- YOU MENTIONED THE KPMG REPORT. AND THAT ALL DUE TO MOVE IT THE ART OF WAS EXTENDED FOR THE TRADE IN SYSTEMS PROCUREMENT I DO YOU HAVE OR TRACK SORRY YEAH DO YOU HAVE A DAY A NEW REVISED STATE I BELIEVE IT WAS ORIGINALLY SEPTEMBER WHEN YOU INTENDED. TO PROCURE THAT CONTRACT OR PUT OUR REGION RIGHT. YES A PROPOSAL FOR WERE ORIGINALLY DOING JUNE AND THEN A DECISION BY. OUR BOARD. OR NOT TO X. THOSE IN SEPTEMBER AND NOW WE PUSH THOSE BACK TO SIT. OKAY SO MY QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT THAT CONTRACT IN THE IN THE PROCESS SO ACCORDING TO YOUR BUSINESS PLAN. OF AND THERE'S A SECTION F. WERE THAT DISCUSSES THE RISKS- AND YOUR CONSULTANT- WRITES THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACTOR IS ENVISIONED TO BE THE KEY LONG TERM CONTRACTOR. OF THE AUTHORITY OVER A PERIOD OF FORTY OR MORE YEARS I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING. THE ENTIRE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE TO THE OPERATOR. AS A RESULT IT WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRACT TO THE AUTHORITY AND INCLUDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RISK TRANSFER INCLUDING INTERFACE RISK WITH OTHER CONTRACTORS. AND ADDITIONAL SCOPE OF FUTURE SEGMENTS. OF SO THIS APPEARS TO BE A VERY SERIOUS VERY IMPORTANT CONTRACT YOU'RE PLANNING TO ENTER WITH. AND EVEN FURTHER KPMG STATES AS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT ALSO REQUIRES MAINTENANCE AND LIFECYCLE PAYMENTS ONCE REVENUE SERVICE COMMENCES. THIS PAYMENT WOULD BE REQUIRED REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT IS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE INTERIM SERVICES AND THE CONTRACTOR WILL HAVE TERMINATION RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRACT. EITHER REVENUE SERVICE DOES NOT START. SO GIVEN THIS IM KPMG RECOMMENDS THEREFORE PRIOR TO THE EXECUTION OF THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT IT'S IMPORTANT SECURE A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. THE SUN HIKING RELATIVE ALREADY AND OTHER RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS ON THE USE OF HIGH SPEED RAIL ASSETS UNTIL THE COMPLETION OF VALLEY TO VALLEY. SO IT SEEMS YOU'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION CONCERNS FROM THIS CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN YOUR RATIONALE FOR ENTERING. INTO THIS CONTRACT DESPITE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE CONSULTANT- WROTE ABOUT. YES I THINK THE REST THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THAT REFINED BUSINESS CASE STUDY BY A KPMG WERE SPOT ON- AND WHAT THE CONSULTANT IS SAYING TO US IS- THAT- WE SHOULD MAKE SURE. THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST ENTERED AN AMMO YOU- WITH THE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE INVOLVED IN THE LEASE PAYMENTS A TO USE OUR FOR A THINGS LIKE MAINTENANCE- ARE- ARE ARE COVERED BY THAT- BY THAT LEASE AGREEMENT AND THAT THAT- THE COMMITMENT TO- TO- COVER THOSE COSTS IS. A WILL BE PART AND PARCEL OF THE OF THE ALTERNATE FINAL AGREEMENT THAT WE WILL- ENTER TO WITH WITH ANY OPERATOR YEAH AND- WELL I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND- WE ARE- AT THE BEGINNING OF A OF THAT THAT- KIND OF WORK IN THAT COMMUNICATION. BOTH WITH THEM- THE- SAN JOAQUIN TO FOLKS. AND THE- CAL OF FOLKS THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S UNDERSTOOD. OKAY SO I YOU KNOW FROM THIS REPORT KPMG PROVIDES- ITS OWN EXPLANATION FOR WHY. YOU MAY BE MOVING FORWARD WITH THE CONTRACT AND STATES THE TRACKING SYSTEM CONTRACT HAS A MECHANISM FOR DETERMINING THE CAPITAL COST OF ALL SEGMENTS AFTER THE FIRST SEGMENT. WHICH INCLUDES A BASKET OF INDEXATION FACTORS RELATING TO INFLATION FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS. SO THIS COULD INCENTIVIZE THE AUTHORITY TO TAKE ADDITIONAL RISK BY ISSUING A NOTICE TO PROCEED PREMATURELY IN ORDER TO SECURE. A LOWER PRICE DOES THAT SOUND RIGHT TO YOU OR WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. BE CLEAR NOT IT'S BEEN A WHILE STILL LOOK AT THAT SPECIFIC SECTION OF THAT REPORT- BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT ONE. OF GETTING THE MO YOU IN PLACE PRIOR TO THE EXCUSE OF THE CONTRACT IS A GOOD RECOMMENDATION OF ONE OF THAT WE ARE WORKING ON. OF A AND B. THAT THE CONTRACT IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY WHERE- IT'S ALL SET ON NOTICES TO PERCY- THE FIRST NOTICE TO PROCEED IS GETTING THE HUNDRED NINETEEN MILE TRACK. PUT DOWN AND THE REASON THAT WE WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT IS BECAUSE THAT IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER OUR FEDERAL FUND A FUNDING AGREEMENT. BUT TO GET THIS WORK COMPLETED BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND SO THERE'S A REASON FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD ON THE CONTRACT I THINK THE PROTECTION ELEMENT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE IS- OUR BOARD PUBLICLY ASKED TO APPROVE. THE NEXT NTP IT EACH AND BE UP BEFORE WE DO IT'S OR BOARD WILL HAVE A CHANCE WE WILL HAVE A PUBLIC DISCUSSION- IN OUR HEARINGS ABOUT. THE IS IT READY IS FUNDING AVAILABLE- IS THE WORK ON THE GROUND DONE TO ENABLE THIS WORK TO BE DONE. EVERY OF THAT THE IS ANOTHER NOTICE TO PROCEED ANTI. THAT HAS TO GO TO WAR WAR. AND THEY WILL NOT A PER IT HELLO BINDING IS A- AND THE WORK ON THE- IS COMPLETED TO DO TO A TO EXECUTE THAT WORK SO WE ARE IN A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE TO TRY TO GET THE TRACK DOWN WE GOTTA GET. A TRACK CONTRACT THE GOING BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT TO DO SO THAT'S JUST ONE HUNDRED NINETY MILES AND THAT HE THE FOR MILES. OF THIS PENDING CONTRA. BUT EVERY. THING IS A SECTION NOTICED A PER. THAT NOT GO FORWARD IF WE'RE NOT. OF READY TO MOVE AND SO I THINK THERE'S A BILL TO BE CAUTIOUS APPROACH AS WE AS WE GO FOR. WHY AT THE SAME TIME GETTING THE TRACK. ON THE GROUND. OR PURSE. TO OUR FEDERAL FOR. AND I WOULD SAY ONE THE THINGS IS. I KNOW IT'S BEEN CONVERSE. ABOUT WHETHER THE SHOULD BE. ELECTRIFIED OR SYSTEM OR NOT. IN OUR VIEW. OF THE SHOULD BE A CONSIST WITH THE- RITUAL FOR PLAN. FOR THIS ACT THAT WAS. BY IN TWENTY AND IT'S ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WAY CAN JUST. A SYSTEMS SELECT SYSTEM AND TO TRY. A ITS MOST EFFICIENT. THE TO DO THAT BUT TOGETHER IN PUT DOWN TRACK OF THE COME BACK LATER. THE END UP KNOW DIG UNDER THE THAT TRACK TO DO. JUST ELECTRIFICATION. SO THAT THAT IS HOW WE HAVE PROPOSED BUT I THINK THE SEPARATE ANTI. GIVE AS A OF THE PART. OF THE OF NOT GOING TO TOO FAST. SO YOU. THAT YOU THAT THE AND YOU. IS A GOOD RECOMMENDATION AND DIESEL. FROM ALL OTHER RISKS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THIS REPORT. DO YOU INTEND TO REVIEW THEM AND- AND DISCUSS THEM EITHER WITH THE BOARD. OR OTHERS. BEFORE. THE CONTRACT. YES AND NOT ALL THE REST OF THE- OR TYPES. TO THE THAT SO THERE ARE. A REST THE WE HAVE TO. BUT WE SHOULD HAVE BE MY OF THE AND IT WORKED THROUGH SO FUN AND OTHER. SO AGAIN. UP LOOK UP. WE ARE GOING TO BE PRUDENT HEARING WE GO I SAID UP EARLIER PRESENT. THAT CERTAINLY THE TIMES AND ALL THAT'S GOING ON THE COLD NINETEEN WHICH MEMBERS HAVE. A REFERENCE REQUIRE US TO BE EXCEEDINGLY PRUDENT AND HOW WE GO. I PUSHING BACK THE THIS GOD WAS OF THE PRUDENCE I THINK. OF WE'RE GOING TO DO A DEEPER DIVE. ALL OF OUR IN OUR NOW IT ENSURE THAT WE ARE IN A GOOD PLACE TO MOVE AS WE- HERE INTO. AGAIN THE BUSINESS PLAN LAID OUT. WHAT WE THOUGHT THE BEST PATH FORWARD WAS ON FEBRUARY TWELFTH THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT IN FRONT OF THE WORLD CHANGING DRAMATICALLY. ADOPTED HAS- WHILE WE- STILL THINK THAT THIS IS THE- BEST APPROACH GOING FORWARD WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE TIME. TO DO A DEEPER DIVE AND MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE DOING THIS CORRECTLY. NO MY CAN WITH YOU KNOW THESE POTENTIAL RISKS ARE. THAT YOU KNOW YOU WOULD COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR MORE FUNDING RIGHT AND THAT. THIS PROJECT CONTINUES. OF TO BE MUCH MORE- THAN WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE- AND SO. THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS YOU KNOW IF YOU STICK TO THE BUSINESS PLAN THAT YOU HAVE. DRAFTED I KNOW OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON. YOU KNOW POTENTIAL TURN ADDITIVES- THAT YOU MAY BE EXPLORING- IN BUT- I THINK. YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE RISKS ARE BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. AND THAT WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN TO A FORTY YEAR CONTRACT RIGHT. BEFORE ANALYZING THESE RISKS AND THE POTENTIAL. OF **** IN. ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT YOU WILL LATER RETURN TO US TO APPROVE. AGAIN I GENERALLY CONCUR WITH THAT SENTIMENT INDICT THERE'S MORE THAT WE NEED TO SAY. ABOUT THE HOW WE ARE. ANALYZING THE WRIST TED TO THAT- YOU KNOW- I WANT TO CONSIDER THAT AND THINK ABOUT WHAT WE- HOW WE ADDRESS THAT THE EITHER THE FINAL A BUSINESS PLAN OR BEYOND. YEAH SO IT I THINK IT LEGISLATORS WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS PROJECT WERE ACTIVISTS ACTIVELY SEEKING- POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVES OR WHETHER THE CURRENT. BUSINESS PLAN IS THE RIGHT WAY TO IMPLEMENT THE VISION OF HIGH SPEED RAIL IN OUR STATE OF YOU KNOW THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY- IF IT- IF YOU'RE TIMELINE IS CORRECT OR I KNOW THERE ARE SOME PRIVATE. OTHER PRIVATE ONES THAT ARE IN DEVELOPMENT DEAL LIKE YOU MENTIONED THE VIRGIN TRAINS- BUT- YOU KNOW. WHEN WE STARTED THIS THERE WAS A BIG VISION FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA- IN OUR COUNTRY- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- IT IS DONE. OF EFFICIENTLY AND YOU KNOW DESPITE LIKE YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT THERE ARE. CONSTRUCTION STARTED BEFORE THE RIGHT OF WAYS AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NEW TO THIS BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR CALIFORNIA AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE AND ASK QUESTIONS AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AGAIN FOR ENGAGING WITH US AND ESPECIALLY IN THE ASSEMBLY WHICH- WE HAVE BROUGHT UP. A LOT OF CONCERNS AND WANT TO SEE OTHER PROJECT ALL. THANK YOU. UNDER THANK YOU SO IN. RIGHT AND I OF THE- OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS IT'S PROGRAM. ASSEMBLYMEMBER I THANK YOU I'D DIRECTOR I MY COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB OF COVERING A LOT OF THE REALLY INCREDIBLE PROBLEMS FACING THIS PROJECT ON WHAT I WANTED TO ASK YOU IS GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE AUTHORITY OVER THE LAST DECADE AND ALSO GIVEN THE EMERGING TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE NOW IN DEVELOPMENT AND THERE ON THE HORIZON. IF CALIFORNIA WAS STARTING FROM SCRATCH TODAY LET'S SAY WE ARE ONLY NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER TO BUILD A HIGH SPEED TRAIN SERVICE FROM NORTHERN TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WOULD YOU RECOMMEND UNDERTAKING THAT PROJECT. I ABSOLUTELY WOULD AND THE REASON I WOULD IS. I'VE BEEN PLAYING IN TRANSPORTATION POLICY FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'VE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE PROJECT THAT OFFERS AS MUCH AS THIS ONE DOES- IN FULL BUILD OUT- IN TERMS OF MOBILITY ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS ALL IN ONE PROJECT THERE IS NO DOUBT. THAT THIS PROJECT IS EXPENSIVE AND WILL TAKE A LONG TIME AND THAT WAS TRUE THE DAY WAS ON THE BALLOT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS PROVIDED NINE BILLION FOR A PROJECT ESTIMATED TO COST FORTY FIVE BILLION. 20% OF WHAT WE NEED SINCE THAT TIME WE'VE WATER OUT IN REGARD FEDERAL FUNDS AND WE'VE GOT ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDS THROUGH CAP AND TRADE- BUT I CAN'T YOU CANNOT BUILD ANOTHER FREEWAYS IN CALIFORNIA OR EXPAND ENOUGH AIRPORTS IN CALIFORNIA. TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIMES LIKE THIS PROJECT CAN DO OF THE IDEA THAT WE CAN MOVE UP FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LOS ANGELES OR AND I IN ABOUT THREE HOURS AS OPPOSED TO DRIVING IT AND SEVEN OR EIGHT. OR AS OPPOSED TO TAKING TRADITIONAL A RAIL THAT TAKES THIRTEEN HOURS- THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO THE PROJECT AND THE ICING ON THE CAKE FOR ME ON THIS IS THE ECONOMIC. OF THE IT WENT SO PEOPLE TO. THOU FIFTY THAT. RATED TODAY. OVER TWO HUNDRED THAT IF WE DO MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD PEAS OF HYPE JOB IT'S A VAMP. OF ANY BY BENEFITS ARE TERRIFIC IS NOT ON IS THIS A LOT. WE HAVE A COMMITMENT TO USING RENEWABLE SOURCE OF POWER SO THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT I AM A SUPPORTER AND I WOULD I WOULD ADVOCATE TO POLICY MAKERS TO CONTINUE. TO TRY TO BUILD AN INTERCITY INTER REGIONAL ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM TO GIVE CALIFORNIANS A BETTER OPTIONS TO TRAVEL AROUND THE STATE NO QUESTION ABOUT IT SO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES LIKE AYE HYPERLOOP TO TAKE ONE EXIT ROAD SYSTEM THANK WILL A COMP THE OBJECTIVES ARE MUCH. THAN HIGHEST RAIL THAT WOULD CHANGE OUTLOOK WHAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE DEVELOPER OF HYPER BUT YOU TALK ABOUT. I THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND THIS IS PROVEN I MEAN THIS IS OPERATING IN EVERY MAJOR OF ECONOMIC- POWER IN THE WORLD EXCEPT HERE OF YOU KNOW HIGH SPEED ELECTRIFIED RAIL- AND SO- THIS IS A PROVEN TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS IMMENSE BENEFITS FOR THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN IT- AND SO YES I WOULD HYPERLOOP I HOPE THAT CONTINUES TO DEVELOP. MY PERSONAL VIEW ON IT RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST MY PERSONAL VIEW IS THAT I THINK ITS APPLICATION IS PROBABLY BETTER FOR GOODS MOVEMENT THAT PEOPLE MOVEMENT AT LEAST AT THIS POINT- UNTIL WE SEE MORE OF- EXACTLY HOW THAT WILL WORK BUT THAT'S THAT'S MY SENSE BUT NOW. YOU KNOW ALONG THE LINES OF YOUR ACTION ON TECHNOLOGY I KNOW OTHERS HAVE SAID THINGS OF LIKE WHAT ABOUT A THOMAS VEHICLES YEAH YOU KNOW I ALSO SUPPORT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A THOMAS OF VEHICLES BUT THOSE VEHICLES OP ON HIGHWAYS THEY'RE NOT GOING TRAVELED TO MILES PER HOUR IN SO AGAIN SO BENEFITS THAT YOU COULD. OUT OF THIS OLD PRIDE TO ME A IS STILL WELL WORK OF THE GAS IT'S THIS. BEEN PART OF THIS. THE PLOT TO WORK. THE I. IF WE HAVE A GLUT WILL TO GET IT DONE I DO J. TO COME OF US FOR. THANK YOU. MR I APPRECIATE YOUR MEGAN AND WITH US I THANK YOU MISTER I DO HAVE TO PANELISTS THAT LIKE TO GET THE QUEUE. THEN YOU AND I CAN A QUESTION ANSWER BUT I WANT TO RISK THEIR TIME IN THE BEEN JACKSON ALSO SO YEP LET'S MOVE ON. REGULAR TO QUEUE UP YOU MAY HAVE ONE THERE ARE. TIME WITH BEGAN. ONE HOW INTERESTING CAN YOU HEAR ME. OKAY YOU HEAR ME. YEAH YES WE. OKAY WONDERFUL GOOD AFTERNOON NUMBER MY NAME HELEN FOR ABILITY AND OFFICE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ME TO AS AFTER AND ALL ALLOW YOU TO PARTICIPATE I REALLY THE OPPORTUNITY. AND SO IN MARCH OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT WE A WHEN TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN IN THAT REPORT WE IDENTIFY BY MAIN OVER ISSUE RELATED CONSIDERATION ALL TRY TO SUMMER AND BRIEFLY I'M THAT THAT THE OUR GETTING KIND OF LATER I BUT HOW CARE ALSO ENTER QUESTION TO AND AS WELL AND FOR THE FIRST EVER TAKE ISSUE THAT WE BROUGHT UP IN A ROOM IS THAT THE CRIME SCHEDULE APPEAR TO BE AN- AND AMBITIOUS BOTH IN THE NEW TERM AND THE LONG TERM. YOUR TURN. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT AND JUST CON I AND WE DO. YOUR CITY PATENT AROUND BY TWENTY TWENTY YOU ON AND THEY NEED TO TAKE THAT APPROACH BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN DELAYS THAT ARE WHICH MEANS THAT THE FULL- ACQUISITION ALL THE CARD READER NEEDED PRETTY INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR BE COMPLETED BEFORE THE ATTACK AND DEFEND CONTRACTOR NEED TO BEGIN WORK I TO WHAT THIS APPROACH IS EXPECTED TO EXPEDITE THE COMPLETION OF THE CONTRACT IT WILL AND IT'S EXPECTED TO ADD SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY. AND RAISE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTRACT. WE WOULD KNOW THAT EVEN WITH MORE COMPLEX APPROACH ARE THERE ISN'T MUCH WIGGLE ROOM IN THE IN THE SCHEDULE FOR THE PROJECT- FEDERAL GRANT DEADLINE. SO CURRENTLY THE AUTHORITY ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO MEET THE FEDERAL GRANT DEADLINE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- HOWEVER- IT WOULD REALLY REQUIRE QUITE AN INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE RATE SO WE ALREADY-HEARD FROM AND MISTER KELLY THAT. THE AUTHORITY HAD INCREASED IT EXPENDITURE RATE AND THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO SO QUITE A BIT MORE THAN EVEN THEY'VE DONE THAT FAR IN ORDER TO MEET THAT. I DON'T GRAY THAT MIGHT. I'M ALSO IN THE LONG TERM. THE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS. PROVIDE ABOUT AND FEES ONE OF APPEARED. SO THAT THAT DEADLINE OR THE DATE THE IN THE- IN THE BUSINESS PLAN THE DRAFT THE PLAN A DIFFICULT FINDING AND AS WE'VE HEARD QUITE A BIT IN THIS HEARING I'M CURRENTLY THERE ISN'T FULL FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT. AND THERE'S PROBABLY THAT'S ABOUT IT AND THAT CAN CHILI- CINCO WHILE COMPLETE MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD BUT NOT. BEING PART OF THE PROJECT. SO THAT REALLY THE COMPLETE DATE FOR THE- FULL VALUE VALLEY IN PHASE ONE IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. FOR THE SECOND KEY OVERSIGHT ISSUE THAT WE WANTED TO RAISE IS THAT FUNDING MAY NOT BE ADEQUATE FOR THE PROJECT AND AGAIN THERE ARE CERTAIN YOUR TERM AS WELL AS LONGER TERM CHALLENGES. THE PROJECT IN THE AREA FOR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THESE ALSO COME WITH THEIR COLLEAGUES. AND SO IN TERMS OF THE NEW TRIMS CHALLENGES THE ACTUAL COST OF AMBER TECHNICALLY SKILLED SEGMENT COULD BE HIGHER THAN IN. THE PROJECT HAS ALREADY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT COST INCREASES- AND GIVEN TO THE PATH. THE PATH TO THE COST INCREASES AS WELL AS JUST THE- NATURE OF THESE LARGE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ESPECIALLY. BAKER SAID THAT MAY INCLUDE SIX EXTENSION MERCED BAKERSFIELD AND THOSE- ARE REALLY AT THE EARLY STAGES AND AS WE HEARD. OF ANY PROJECT AND THE EARLY STAGES OF DESIGN THERE THAT YOU MORE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THAT COST. AND WE ALSO THAT IT'S UNCLEAR IF THE FINDINGS THAT ANTICIPATED WAFFLING MATERIALIZE- SO ESSENTIALLY THE- BAKERSFIELD SEGMENT WELL I'VE DONE SOME FUNDING SOURCES THAT YOU HAVE MEANT CERTAIN KEY ONE OF THEM WE HEARD ABOUT A LITTLE BIT IS THE FEDERAL GRANT. THE POINT FIVE BILLION IN FEDERAL GRANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS. THREATENED TO EXPAND BE USED AND SO- THAT'S CERTAINLY A WRECK FAIR. ADDITIONALLY THE PLAN RELIES ON ESTIMATES THE FUTURE CAP AND TRADE REVENUE. AND THERE'S AN IMPORTANT PIECE HERE AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY GIVING HER THE NINETEEN AND- UNDER AND CONCERNS THAT WHETHER YOU MIGHT UP WITHIN A SHORT TERM. BOB COOK HAPPENS RIGHT SO BOTH FIND OUT WHAT THE NAY RESULTS ARE VERY SOON BACK. ON THAT THE CONFLICT. WELL COULD MAKE OF THE STATE AFTER TO THE FEDERAL FINE OR AND KEPT TRADE REVENUE TO MATERIAL OR CAR CARD ARE HIGHER THE THEY THERE NEEDS TO BE FUNDING SOURCES PERHAPS THE GENERAL. THAT THAT THAT IS COMPLETELY GROSSED OUT I'M WE DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF THAT TIGHTENING OF THE FUNDING IT MIGHT NOT A LINE WITH PROJECT PLEASE- THAT WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KPMG TUDY I'M NOT STUDY IDENTIFIED THAT EVEN IF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME IS THERE FOR THE PROJECT FROM THE BAKERSFIELD EVEN IF THE STATE HAS SUFFICIENT CARPENTRY REVENUE IN WHICH CAME AROUND. BUT HE MAY NOT A LINE AND PARTICULARLY IF AND CABINETRY REVENUES ON THE LOWER END FOR EXAMPLE THERE MAY BE SOME. CASH CERTAIN YEARS. WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE VEHICLE AND WITH MY HOW TO ADDRESS THANK IT'S SOMETHING THAT AT NEAR WITHOUT AND IT COULD BE MORE CAL TO PROVIDE AND BY NAME THE PROJECT IF IT ANYTHING THAT'S NOT A GOOD THE- I KNOW COURSE I'M NOT. INTO ALONG TERM VALUE CHALLENGE. AND I THINK ENOUGH FOR THE REST OF THE CROWD. ARE THERE CERTAIN UNCERTAIN HE ABOUT. THE LEVEL OF KERR FOR THE PROJECT- BOTH BECAUSE IT'S JUST A LARGE SCALE. CAPITAL PROJECT WE'VE ALREADY HEARD AND CERTAINTY AND MANY OF THE QUESTIONS AND THE VERY EARLY STAGES WHILE SO THERE'S- A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THERE- AND THEN ALSO AS- HAS BEEN NOTED. THERE'S NO FUNDING PLAN YET COMMERCE SAID DEBATERS BEFORE BEYOND RESPECTIVELY. BUT THE POINT. I THANK CLEAR HOW THAT ADDITIONAL. FUNDING WOULD BE WOULD BE NOT. YES THAT WE WANTED TO BRING A- IT THAT AN OPERATING SAID TO IS EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED AGAIN I KNOW THAT COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT THAT- SOME EXTENT I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THE POINT BUT EVENTUALLY THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO USE THE THIRD PARTY PUBLIC ENTITY TO OPERATE THIS INTERIM SERVICE THE PEOPLE TAKE COMPLIANCE WITH PROPOSITION ONE A- AND THE MEASURE DOES HAVE SOME LANGUAGE THERE THAT WAS REFERENCE- AND- THAT. AT THAT. GLORY FROM FRIEND REQUIRING OPERATING. AT TO THIS APPROACH WOULD BASICALLY SAID THAT THE TAXPAYERS WOULD STILL END UP POTENTIALLY SUBSIDIZING OPERATION- BUT IT WOULD BE THROUGH THE THIRD PARTY- AND SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY NECESSARILY CHANGE THE PRACTICAL THE FACT THAT THE STATE WOULD BEAR INTERSTATE TAXPAYERS WOULD BEAR A PORTION OF THE DISTANT OPERATING COSTS AT LEAST DURING THAT NONE OF THAT. LAND SO PROVINCIALLY. A CONCERN IN TERMS OF THE SPIRIT OF THE MEASURE. AND THEN- THE FOURTH ISSUE I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. IS REALLY THAT THAT THE FACT THAT THIS INTERIM SERVICE DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. I KNOW THERE ARE ALSO REFERENCES TO RIDERSHIP AND- HOW DID OPTION COMPARED WITH THE DORY THING FOR COMPARATIVE MOTHER OPTION. I'M REALLY BEEN ALICE'S THAT WAS DONE BY THAT REALLY TRAIN OPERATOR AND- IT REALLY DEPENDS ON. A VARIETY OF THE TIMES. THAT THEY MAKE IN TERMS OF DURING THE MODELING I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THEM. THAT ARE PARTICULARLY NOTABLE. ONE IS THAT THE ANALYSIS ASSUMES THE COMPLETION OF OTHER CAPITAL PROJECTS AND ONE OF THE MAIN ONES THAT THE FILM IS THE COMPLETION. OF AT STATION AT AT MERCED THAT WOULD SERVE. AS YOU. LOOK AT. THE SAME ONCE. AS WELL AS A OPPOSED HIGH RAIL AUTHORITY. SO CURRENTLY. I'M WORKING IN THE- THEY HAVE A SEPARATE. OCCASIONS THAT'S ABOUT OVER MILE AWAY FROM THAT HIGH SPEED RAIL. PLANTATION AND TO THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE INTEGRATED. SO THE ESTIMATE THAT PROJECT WOULD BE COMPLETED AND FIND AT. THEY ALSO- ALSO HE ANNOUNCES THAT SEEMS PERFECT RELIABILITY AND THAT'S NOT JUST THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE. BUT ALSO CONNECTING TRAIN AND BUS SERVICES AND THAT THEY WOULD OPERATE WITH 100% RELIABILITY. I'M HOWEVER CURRENTLY THOSE OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES DON'T-OPERATE AT THAT LEVEL OF RELIABILITY AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER. THAT WOULD MATERIALIZE. IF YOU GO BACK TO DOCTOR KILLERS POINTS HERE I THINK THE REASON WHY THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE SO HE- BECAUSE- AND- THAT BASICALLY THAT ANALYSIS ASSUME REALLY THAT. EASY WE MUST TRANSFER I'M AND NOT I THINK ONE OF THE KEY THING THAT DRIVING ON THE HIGHER RIDERSHIP THAT THEY'RE ASSUMING. I'M THIRTY THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE STATION ISN'T WELL INTEGRATED OR- WHAT THE SERVICES DON'T PERFECTLY CONNECTING PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT AND YOU KNOW THAT COULD BE IT COULD BE A LESS DESIRABLE TRANSPORTATION OPTION OF HER WRITERS SPEND IT IF YOU CAN. ANALYSIS AND THEN AND I ASSUMPTION THAT MY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHTED BUT IT ALSO YEAH THIS ALSO WITH THEM- AS WOULD MENTION THAT. BASICALLY THERE'S NO COMPETING SERVICE- ALONG THAT SEGMENT THAT THAT THAT HAVE YOUR LOGO HE WOULD OPERATE THERE. AND TO BASICALLY THE FAMILY HE WOULDN'T OPERATE SOUTH OF MERCED. SO QUICKLY TRADE OUT REGARDING THAT. THE COUNTY PROVIDE THEM CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CAN WHAT I'M SERVICE ON THAT SEGMENT. AND EXCUSE ME THAT WOULD- THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY CHANGE RIDERSHIP WITH WHAT. SO WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT- IF SOME OF THOSE END UP BEING OPTIMISTIC OR INCORRECT THAT COULD DEFINITELY CHANGED THE RIDERSHIP ESTIMATES. THAT THE AUTHORITY AND THE STORY HAS IN THEIR PLAN AND THAT COULD CHANGE EVEN THE RELATIVE- THE RELATIVE RIDERSHIP BY VARIOUS OPTIONS SO. I THERE ARE A COUPLE OPTIONS THAT WERE LOOKED AT- ONE IN THE LA AREA I WON IN THE BAY AREA YOUR COMPARED AGAINST THE OPTION AND- FOR THAT MUCH THAT THE BAKERSFIELD MINE. I AM CERTAINLY HOW THOSE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES COMPARE WAITED WOULD BE BASED ON. THE TYPES OF ASSUMPTIONS AND WHETHER THAT PLAY OUT. ALSO WHEN HE TO HIGHLIGHT THE OTHER ALTER EXIST IF YOU OF THOSE. LINE IF YOU CAN SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. YOU COULD DO A SHORTER LONGER STATEMENT YOU CAN GRIND DIFFERENT TAKE THE TRAIN BUT AT A NEW. KIND OF PEOPLE TRAINED COULD RUN EITHER YOUR MISSION TRAIN. I'M CALLING YOU IF DIFFERENT SET OF PROJECT AS WELL IF YOU READ AT NINETY SO THERE ARE. DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED. AND THEN FINALLY- IN TERMS OF ISSUES THAT THIS ISSUE I WANTED HER HIGHLIGHT AND THAT WE THAT WE HAD IN OUR REPORT IS THAT THAT BECAUSE THE COACH PROVIDED BY THE AUTHORITY. I DOESN'T PROVIDE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY SO I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE REALLY KEY POINTS. ON THE AUTHORITY PLANS TO TAKE ACTION IN TWENTY TWENTY- ON SOME MAJOR THINGS THAT WELL KIND OF STAND HAPPENED THAT THE STATE DOWN IN THE PATH OF DOING WORK THAT THE BAKERSFIELD. AND DOING IT ANON ELECTRIFIED WAY. AND THE KEY ACTIONS INCLUDE ENTERING INTO THE TRACKING SYSTEM CONTRACT- AND EVEN THAT FIRST INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT INCLUDE THE ELECTRIFICATION COMMITMENT. ALL OF THAT THE ONE PIECE. OF ONCE THAT CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO THAT IT GETS HARDER TO AND- THE LAYOUT YOUR VACATION FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WANTED TO DO THAT. AND ALSO THE AUTHORITY PLANNED- IN TWENTY TWENTY YOU PROCURE ELECTRIC TRAIN TO AGAIN THAT WOULD START TO COMMIT THE STATE IN THE NEAR TERM TO RUNNING LIKE TO HIDE SERVICE. AND ALSO TO- ACQUIRE RIGHT AWAY OUTSIDE OF THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT SELECT THE HERD. CURRENTLY THE AUTHORITY IS JUST ACQUIRING PROPERTIES WITHIN THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. BUT THEY WOULD PLAN TO START DOING THAT AFTER THEY START MOVING BEYOND THAT- ALL THE WAY UP TO MERCED AND IN DOWN TO BAKERSFIELD AND EVEN POTENTIALLY MOTHER AREA AS WELL- ONCE THEY HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE. ACTIVE SO IN THE COMING MONTHS. THE ONE THOSE PROPERTY ACQUISITION START- IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO CHANGE COURSE BECAUSE- WHILE THE STATE COULD. GET RID OF THOSE PROPERTIES THEIR COSTS THERE AND ALSO WITH THEM DIFFICULT. FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS BOB. SO WE WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE THAT IF A REALLY HE TIME THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE THIS TO MAKE A DECISION. ON THE PATH OF THE PROJECT BECAUSE- NEXT YEAR THERE MAY BE FEWER VIABLE OPTION DO THE OPTION MIGHT BE MORE LIMITED IN A LOT OF WAYS. I'M SO COURSE THAT LEGISLATURE COULD CONTINUE WITH THE APPROACH IDENTIFIED BY THE AUTHORITY. ON THE LEGISLATURE COULD SELECT A DIFFERENT APPROACH FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD JUST. TRY TO OKAY FINE THAT FEDERAL GRANT- AGREEMENTS. ARE REQUIREMENTS WHICH WAS REALLY JUST KIND OF BASIC TRACK IN THAT INITIAL CONSTRUCTION SEGMENT. I'M WORKING MOTHER APPROACH IF THE LEGISLATURE IS REALLY COMFORTABLE MAKING THAT DECISION. IF NOT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CERTAINLY- DIRECTLY ACCORDING TO TAKE ACTION TO HELP PRESERVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THE DECISION COULD BE MADE AT A LATER DATE. THAT COULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE- MODIFYING THE TRACK AND DEFENSE CONTRACT SO THAT OF COURSE NOTED TO PROCEED ONLY REALLY INCLUDE. THE FEDERAL GRANT SCOPE- ACCORD CAPS EVEN JUST- DELAYING SOME OF THE HOT. I COULD THE LINE ROLLING STOCK FOR WE'RE DEALING PROPERTY ACQUISITION OPTION CONSIDERATION. AND SO I KNOW THAT A LOT- HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO AYE CONTINUING DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE. ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE OF THE L. L. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- WONDERFUL UNBIASED A- REPORT AND WE ALWAYS RELY ON YOU FOR. YOUR EXPERTISE IN GUIDING US. WHEN THESE ISSUES COME UP AND I REALLY DO AFFECT THANK YOU FOR THAT. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO MODERATOR- MISTER LUTON SEND THE- CALIFORNIA HIGH SPEED RAIL PEER REVIEW GROUP. AND LUTON TO YOUR LINE IS OPEN. OKAY HERE ARE MY OWN NOW. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU. OKAY ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO RIGHT HERE TODAY. ALL I AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMAN'S REMARKS ABOUT YOUR WITH YOUR GROUP YEAH- I'M SORRY THAT I CAN'T BE THERE IN PERSON BUT WE ALL UNDERSTAND WE LIVE BUT WE ARE FACING WITH KIND OF PUBLIC GATHERING. AT FIRST WHEN I REQUEST. FOR ALL. WHY OF WORDS SHORT SHIRT ON I CAN YEAH DO IT. ALL BY. WHAT IS GOING. ABLE TO EVER WE CAN OKAY OR COMMON ON THE DRAFT TWENTY TWENTY THE PLAN ONE IS GOING TO PULL SOME THE MERE. WE'VE ALSO MORE DETAIL COMMON WOULD BE A PRIORITY. FIRST OF ALL WE MEAN ANYTHING WELL YOU WORK AND THE BE IN THE OKAY. AND WE THANK THE THERE'S A LOT. OF GOOD PICTURE OF THE ISSUE SMALL. REALLY DOES. CAREFUL WHEN YOU. YEAH TWENTY POINT DOES NOT PLAN THE AUTHORITY PROPOSED TO COMPLETE THE L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G NOW UNDER&lt;/c&gt; WAY FROM A THERE THE POPLAR AVENUE NORTH OF BAKERSFIELD THIS WOULD FULFILL THE FEDERAL OUR OBLIGATION. ADD UP THIRTY THREE MILES AWAY FROM WHERE SAID THAT TO MY DEAR I WOULD COULD NOT PART OF THE ORIGINAL. ONE COMPLETE NINETEEN LARA WENT FROM POPLAR AVENUE ON IN THE BAKERSFIELD. ELECTRIFY AND SIGNALING EMPIRE ONE SEVENTY ONE MILES LEFT IN AND PURCHASE PRICE THREE ELECTRICAL AND. SOFTWARE TESTING OPERATIONS. WE ARE ONE ROOF. THE SYSTEM TO WORK SEPARATE ARE A POSSIBLY YEAH HE'S ELSE IT TAKES OR THE STATE. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY RUN TRYING COOLEY CONCORD. HIGH SPEED RAIL FOR ALL OF THE COST TO MAINTAIN AND OPERATE THE WINE AND THE WILL. WE DIRECTOR PLAN WORKING CRANE BILL WITH THE NEW LINKS AND FULLY CORD MAKE THE OPERATION OKAY AND WITH THEM WORKING. REVENUE STATION COULD BE BUILT ON THE SAID. AWARD HELLO TERM. CONTRACTUALLY GOING WELL LACK OF PROTECTION AND IN DOING MAINTENANCE THE ONE YOU WANT CONTRACT FOR. THE CONTRACT WOULD HAVE A SERIES OF NUMBERS THE RECEIPT OR ANYTHING PLEASE WHAT. OTHER THAN COMPLETED. AWARD A CONTRACT WILL PREVENT HIM PASSING AND LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF A HIGH SPEED LOW AND THOUGHT. WE HAVE DISCUSSED ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IN EARLY OR WHATEVER IN THE MALL HE BY WALTER GO HERE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN NARAL ADVANCE THE- PROPOSAL. IF THE LETTER WANTS TO HAVE OTHER OPTIONS YOU WILL NEED TO REQUIRED THAT THEY BE DEVELOPED BLACKHEART THE WAY I LOOK AT RT CALTRAIN METROLINK AND HELPFUL. WE ARE THIRTY FOUR AND WHAT IS A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED IN OUR WATER. FIRST THE TERMS OF THE PROPOSED WE HAVE NOT BEEN DEVELOPED OR AGREED WITH POTENTIAL LENGTHY. WELCOME TO GET SOMETIME LET ME OSCE WILL COVER ALL OF THE AUTHORITIES COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN PROVEN NOR IS IT A FAD WORD THE USE OF A LEASE WELL WHAT WE CAN BE AUTHORITY OF THE POOL THERE AGAIN BUT THE- ONE I. IT IS NOT THAT THE LEFT WILL CORRECT REVENUE AND OPERATING COSTS FOR SOMETHING HE WOULD HAVE. BEEN A LOT. OF OPERATION. THE ESTIMATED CAPITAL COST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK ON NOT BEING STONE FINALIZE DESIGN AND THEY PRESUME THAT THE AUTHORITY WILL BE ABLE TO STAY WITHIN BUDGET AND SCHEDULE FOR THE RIGHT MORE. SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO ON THEIR EXISTING CONTRACTS. AND BACTERIAL PROJECTING OF 70% OVER RUN ON AVERAGE ON THE CURRENT CONTRACT ALONG. WITH TO THE BRING YOUR WAY. WE DO WORK. THAT YEAH HAVE LEARN FROM. NIGHT AND HE MADE ME CRY. MAJOR TRAVEL AND GIVE YOU A NINE. THE PROPOSED LONG TERM CONTRACT CONTRACT ELECTRIFICATION SIGNAL CONSTRUCTION AND MAKING WILL BE COMPLEX THE DEVELOP. AND IT SHOWS AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF LIVE TRANSFER TO THE CONTRACT THE WORK. DELAYED OR PROTESTS FROM THE CONTRACT COULD COULD BE ACCURATE. AT THE EXPECTED PERHAPS HAVE WILLING BASED ON YEAH WHATHAPPENED TRADE REACHING THAT NO YOU COULDN'T COPE WITH NINETEEN IMPACT. IT ALSO RELIES ON NINE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE DOLLARS IN FEDERAL GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN WITHIN YOUR- LONG TWO AND A HALF MILLION OR SO AND ERA FUNDING THAT WILL BE AYE WE ARE IF WE HAVE ALREADY DOES NOT MEET THE DEADLINE OF IN THE TWENTY TWO. TWO AND THEY ALL RIGHT WE'RE ABOUT. THANK YOU THEN THE WAR WE RECKON. WITH THE IN PARTY SHOULD NOT A WORD THAT WILL STOP CRIME BUT THE- COMMITMENT HAVE BEEN FINE WITH THE ARE. OF THE ANYWAY FOR THE. INCLUDING COMMITTED AND FOR THAT THE BILL OF BE TO HAVE AND AGREED CODE. OPERATE SCHEDULED. THE AUTHORITY SHOULD BE DONE NOT THE TRACK AND CON UNTIL ONLY A VERY WITH OPERATE THAT FINE FOR A MINIMUM THE FIRST NUMBER SHE SHOULD BE ALRIGHT FOR OUR WORK AND MARK ALL FUTURE. OVER CONDITIONS ON THE FLY HE THE OPERATING A. I'VE NOTED OUR WAY BUT COULD BE. WAS OVER ANALYZE WITH THE A BM B. RIGHT THAT IS THE GET STARTED. IT COULD BE A PRIORITY DONE WE COULD BECAUSE BECAUSE- THE WONDERFUL WILL EFFECTIVE BE TO FINISHING THE SYSTEM OF MERCED THE BACK OF THE OLD WON'T BE IN BURGER OPTION. ALL IT DID FOR INCREDIBLY DONE IT WILL TO PRESSURE FINISH WITH THE FOOTBALL AND THAT WILL WORK DO SO WORKING WITH HAND BEYOND IN OF THE YEAH APPROVED. THE LEGISLATURE BEGIN BEACON WHAT THE SOURCE WOULD BE. FINALLY AND THE CALL THAT WE EXTRA ALTHOUGH YOUR PEER REVIEW THE BUT- NINE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT I MEAN WHAT ALL COULD HAVE A GOOD WORLD AND TRENDS. OF OUR- I'M CAL RIPKEN THEIR ISSUE IS THE BILL AT THE LONG TERM. ISSUE. IT WILL NEVER BE STATE. IF YOU CAN BECAUSE BY BUT AT THE END INCREASE COSTS THE ISSUE HELLO THE END. YEAH WHAT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND FOR YOU OKAY. AND YOUR KNOW THE REVIEW WILL LOOK FOR YEAR. AND WE ARE WILL HELP HELLO BUT WE CAN ARM I WILL BE TO GO COULD BE COLLECTED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER TOM ANY QUESTIONS OKAY OF A MISTER TOM UP FOR REVIEW GROUP. XENON MISTER THOMPSON AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR CANDOR AND YOUR EXPERTISE I HAVE RELIED ON YOU FOR. THE FIVE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN THE CHAIR- AS WE HAVE OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROJECT. AND I LOOK TALK LOOK FOR TO TALKING TO YOU THE NEAR FUTURE. ON ADDRESSING YOUR CONCERNS TO THE BOARD OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER KELLY. IS GERMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND AGAIN I REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE ON THE- THIS LONG HEARING BUT WE ONLY HAVE EVERY TWO YEARS TO REALLY COVER. THIS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ACROSS FOR TEASING DOT ALL RISE AS FAR AS OUR- OUR ROLES OVERSIGHT. SIR SO. I'VE GOT SEVERAL QUESTIONS. AND YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW. LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT WHERE WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW COALBED. CALL THE NINETEEN WHAT EFFECT ON PRODUCTION HASN'T HAD THUS FAR. IT'S VERY GOOD QUESTION WE'VE BEEN UP THERE IN SOME WAYS WE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY BLESSED MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE- ON THE CONSTRUCTION SITE. IT'S BEEN VERY LITTLE- IMPACT- WE'VE GOT A COUPLE OF POSITIVE- CASES WE'VE TAKEN ALL THE- APPROPRIATE- ACTIONS THE ISOLATE OF THOSE EMPLOYEES. AFFECTED AGAIN USER NOW THE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WORKING ON THE CONSTRUCTION ITSELF- AND SO WE HAVE VERY LIMITED IMPACT AND AS I REPORTED TO YOU EARLIER MY PRESENTATION. WE'RE SAYING THE CONSTRUCTION ADVANCE SO AT THAT THAT PART IS VERY POSITIVE UP WE ARE SEEING IN OTHER AREAS OF SOME IMPACT WE DON'T ENTIRELY KNOW YOU HEARD MISTER THOMPSON. A MOMENT AGO SUGGESTS THERE COULD BE IMPACTS TO THE- A CAP AND TRADE UP AUCTIONS OF IT IN THIS IS A- IT AS A FACT OF THE OF THE PANDEMIC ON THE- GLOBAL ECONOMY WE ARE- YOU KNOW WE'RE WATCHING IT VERY CLOSELY SO THAT'S- THE ONE AREA WHERE THIS QUESTION- I MENTIONED THAT- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS- WE'VE HAD A- REQUEST. FROM COMMUNITIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO HAVE MORE TIME TO RESPOND TO OUR DRAFT DOCUMENTS THAT WE'VE RELEASED IN SOME CASES THEY'VE ASKED FOR AS MANY AS- THIRTY OR FORTY FIVE DAYS AND WE HAVE GRANTED ON. TO THUS FAR FIFTEEN SO WE CAN. GIVE THEM MORE TO OMIT BUT ALSO TRY TO LIMIT. THE IMPACT ON OUR WORK. BUT THE ANOTHER PLACE A THAT WE'RE SAY OF SOME OF THE IMPACT- AND- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT- THERE IS A LITTLE LESS. THERE ARE CERTAIN DAYS THE RIGHT WORD BUT I WOULD SAY THAT- BIDDERS ON THE ATTRACTED SYSTEMS CONTRACT ARE BEING A CAUTIOUS AND VERY- DELIVERED OF IN IN IN SORT OF CAUTIOUS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF SHORTY BONDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IN TODAY'S FINANCIAL MARKETS SO THAT WAS PART OF THE REASON WE DELAYED- BY. BUT ABOUT TWO MONTHS THE TRACKING SYSTEMS CONTRACT- SO. YEAH WE'RE SEEING IT IN A KIND OF BITS AND PIECES IN VARIOUS. PARTS OF THE PROGRAM AS I SAID WE'VE BEEN BLESSED OF THE CONSTRUCTION LEVEL ABOUT WE ARE. MISSING SOME IMPACTS AND SOME OF THE OTHER OTHER PACES AND IT'S AND IT'S ENOUGH FOR I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A DEEPER. A BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE ON THE RISK ASSESSMENTS HERE. APPRECIATE THAN WHAT. AND IT JUST KIND OF KIND OF TAG ALONG WITH MISTER THOMPSON SAID ABOUT THE CAP AND TRADE- YOUNG YOUR- RELIANCE ON IT THUS FAR. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NEW BUDGET HAS BEEN PROJECTED WITH YOU- NET OPERATING LOSS. THE TWO BUSINESSES WILL HAVE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF GO AHEAD AND DO THE NEW BUDGET NOW SAYS IT RETROACTIVELY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO CLAIM THOSE LOSSES AND THEN THE TAX CREDITS THAT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO ASSUME THIS YEAR I'M THINKING THAT THERE'S GONNA BE A REPERCUSSION DOWNSTREAM NOT ONLY TO THE ECONOMY BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW THE BASIS OF THESE THESE COMPANIES WON'T HAVE THAT MONEY TO BE BUYING EMISSION CREDITS- BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT- THAT MONEY ANYMORE OR THAT ABILITY TO. NIELSEN THEIR LOSSES OR THESE TAX CREDITS THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE PAST SO. I THINK IT CAN BE BE WARRANTED- GOING FORWARD THAT THE RELIANCE. AND THE CONSISTENCY OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND THAT CAP AND TRADE MIGHT BE IMPACTED DIRECTLY- FAR MORE THAN YOU CAN REALIZE JUST BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET. A NUMBER TWO WHEN I LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE INVESTMENT- OF CAP AND TRADE INTO THE PROJECT. YOU KNOW CARVE THEIR INNER SCOPING PLAN SAYS THAT THE STATE'S EMISSION GOALS HIGH SPEED RAIL CONTRIBUTE. 1% OF THE REDUCTION. GOING FORWARD BUT YET WE'RE INVESTING 25% OF THE CABIN TRADE REVENUES INTO THIS PROJECT. HAS THERE EVER BEEN A CASH BENEFIT ANALYSIS DONE MISTER KELLY THAT TO KNOW THAT THIS MONEY IS WELL SPENT ON A MISSIONS VERSES THE 1% VERSUS WHAT COULD BE DONE ELSEWHERE. OF VALUE. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT I WOULD SAY THIS- MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT- THE CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS GOING TO THIS PROGRAM OR ACHIEVING. OF MANY OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CAPITA RIGHT PROGRAM LAID OUT. UP AT FULL OF FILLED OUT THE THIS PROGRAM WILL. EXCEED BY ITSELF JUST THIS PROJECT- IN TERMS OF THE MISSION BENEFITS ALL OF THE CAP AND TRADE- A PROGRAMS FUNDED TO DATE- THAT ARE NOT HIGH SPEED RAIL IN TERMS OF THE- TOTAL REDUCTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE. IN SO- AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO CAR THAT'S NOT ACCORDING TO US THAT'S THAT'S IN IN CARBS DOCUMENTATION SO I THINK. ONE I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT A TO A CAP AND TRADE IS ALSO IS SUPPOSED TO EXPAND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. AND JOBS AND I THINK THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WE ARE THE OF VERY. OF IMPORT THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF WHAT WE DO- AND I'M I'M VERY PROUD OF THAT THE WORK IN THE END SO- AND THREE OF THEY WANTED CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS TO LARGELY BE FOCUSED IN. DISADVANTAGED AREAS AND AGAIN IF YOU LAY OVER THE SORT OF THE- THE IDENTIFICATION DISADVANTAGED AREAS WITH. ARE THE PROPOSED ALIGNMENT- WE LAY WE- WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF THE POSTER CHILD FOR- FOR INVESTING IN THOSE IN THOSE COMMUNITY. AND SO IN THAT SENSE I THINK IT'S- A- IT IS BEST TO GET THE TRADEOFF NINETY WHERE WE ARE. THE IN MANY WAYS THE EXAMPLE OF- OF WHAT CAPITA RATE DOLLARS- COULD DO- THAT WAS STANDING ARE PROBLEMS OF THE PAST I THINK THE- THE BETTER WE GET THE MORE THAT WILL PAY OFF. THANK YOU- IN YOU MENTIONED YOU'RE ABOUT 40% ON THE- INITIAL ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN MILES HOW MUCH RAIL HAS BEEN LAID. A TRACK NOT. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T EXECUTED THE TRACK CONTRACTED. HOW MANY PARCELS- DID YOU BUY IN THIS. WITH ME AND NOT YOU PERSONALLY BUT THE AUTHORITY BY AND HAVE NO NEED FOR NOW HOLDING- KIND OF STAGNATED- RESOURCES. BUT MISTER CHAIRMAN UP TO GET BACK TO YOU ON ON ON THAT THAT NUMBER ARE TOTAL OR PARTIAL PROCUREMENT TO DATE- ACQUISITION IS ABOUT SIXTEEN OH THREE IN TERMS OF TOTAL PARCELS THAT WE PURCHASED. UP SOME OF THOSE- THEY DO HAVE MORE THAN YOU IMMEDIATELY NEED BUT THEN THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE HAVE TO CONSIDER ABOUT WHERE WE LOCATE- THE OTHER PART MAKE YOU KNOW MAINTENANCE FACILITIES- OTHER THINGS THAT ARE PART OF THIS THAT MAY NEED MORE THAN JUST. THE TRACK ITSELF- AND SO A SOME OF THAT IS THE STUFF THAT WE- STEP TO GO THROUGH WHAT I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK WITH THE SPECIFIC ON HOW MANY PARCELS WE'VE PURCHASED THAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SURPLUS I DON'T. I DON'T HAVE THAT WITH ME RIGHT NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE YOU GETTING BACK TO ME ON THAT SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOU KNOW THE- ALLOCATED BOND AT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE BOND SERVICE THE DEBT IS EVERY YEAR THAT WE PAY OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. FOR THE FOR THE BOND MONEY WE'VE BORROWED SO FAR FOR THIS PROJECT I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE- WHAT THE INTEREST RATE IS IT WOULD BE. A ROUGHLY THE SAME AS ANY OTHER GEOPARK. AND USUALLY IT'S PRETTY. PRETTY GOOD OF YOU KNOW. TO BE HELPFUL TO KNOW WHEN WE LOOK AT A REALLOCATION OF BOND YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT IS. UNNECESSARY EXPENDITURE RIGHT NOW IN THE IN THE COMING BUDGET AND THE ALSO THE NECESSARY HUMAN SERVICES THAT ARE BEING DEPLETED. AND ALSO WHAT IS THE COMPOSITION AND AGAIN SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE PAUSE AND LOOK AT WHAT IS IT A PRIORITY. AND SEEING SOME OF THE STATE AGENCIES BELIEVE THAT THEY DON'T. HAVE ANY REASON TO PAUSE THEIR MISSIONS. ARE ON THE BACK OF OTHER PEOPLE'S ODD YOU KNOW. BEING IMPACTED BY THIS COVE INDOOR OR THIS IS RECESSION WE'RE WE'RE ENTERING INTO BECAUSE OF THIS PANDEMIC SO I'D REALLY BE INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT THE BOND THAT GOING FORWARD AS OR YEARLY IS- SO THAT I CAN MAKE A- BUDGET DECISION WHEN I COMING OF. FORD AND I KNOW IT'S AN OBLIGATED GEO BUT THE FURTHER ALLOCATION WILL BE HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED. WHEN WE HAVE THAT ALSO THE RIDERSHIP. NOW I APPRECIATE THE. B. THE ASSUMPTION THAT THERE WILL BE THIS EIGHT POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE. OUR UTILIZING HIGH SPEED RAIL DIRECTLY DUE TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT BUT THERE'S NOT THAT MANY PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS THE SANCTION IS TWELVE TRAINS AN HOUR. WHICH IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY YOU LOOK AT THE CONNECTIONS THAT FROM THE SAN JOSE AUTHORITY OR THE BUS TO LOS ANGELES. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM THAT- THOSE NUMBERS ARE ARE FAIR WORKABLE NUMBERS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT NIGHT I WOULD APPRECIATE. SOME RECONSIDERATION DONE THAT YOU KNOW THE- RIGHT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE BUSINESS PLAN HONESTLY MISTER KELLY. WE'RE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE PUTTING THESE TOGETHER THESE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY BENEFACTORS OF THIS PROJECT. AND SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT IS AND WE HAVE THE PEER GROUP REVIEW GROUP. DISPUTE A WE HAVE THE LA DISPUTING IT- SO I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE. ROLLING BACK IN UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT CONTROLLER THE BUSINESS PLAN IS. UNDER SCRUTINY. AND SHOULD BE REVIEWED AGAIN. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT COMPONENT OF IT TO ME. I WAS IN THE BOOK SECTION I WOULD GO RIGHT TO FICTION AND REALLY DOES. LEND ITSELF TO THAT IT'LL HAVE TO PROMOTE THE PROJECT. LIKE THAT TO BE ABLE TO. WE UTILIZE ALL THE OTHER NUMBERS IN THE IN THE IN THE SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THAT I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY USING THEIR MILLION MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN JUST IF I MIGHT ON THAT POINT. THE YEAH THE NUMBERS USE FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY SECTION- CAME FROM THE MODEL THAT WAS USED. FOR THE OF THE STATE RAIL PLAN AND THE- OF REAL WORLD OF WORK THAT- THE SAN JOAQUIN IS AN ACE. OF BOTH SEE TODAY AND WHAT THE PROJECT IN THE FUTURE- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT TERMS OF- YOU KNOW. OF ANY CONFLICT WITH US ON WHAT THOSE NUMBERS SAY IN. DECISIONS WE MAKE GOING. A GOING FOR REMEMBER WE WERE. WE'RE NOT THE OPERATE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE THE OPERATORS ON THE SECTION OF THE INTERIM-SO I DON'T- YOU KNOW I WANT TO USE THESE NUMBERS TO MAKE. GOOD DECISIONS LIKE YOU DO. AND IF THERE'S- ADDITIONAL PEER REVIEW. AT THAT THAT YOU THINK WE SHOULD. UNDERTAKE TO SOLIDIFY OR GIVE MORE CREDENCE TO. OF THE NUMBERS WILL CERTAINLY. I CONSIDER THAT YEAH PROJECT THAT IN ONE OF THE THINGS TAT REALLY TROUBLES ME AS WE LOOK AT. HI THE ADDITION DOLLARS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ADD THE EXTENSION CLOSELY ELECTRIFICATION. THE THIRTY YEAR MAINTENANCE CONTRACT PROPER RATIONS THE TRAIN PROCUREMENT. AND THAT'S TO GET SOMEBODY NINETY MINUTES FASTER THAN THEY COULD. ON BASS STRING. AND AGAIN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IS I DON'T WANNA BE A DETRIMENT THIS PROJECT BUT I WANT THE MONEY SPENT IN A FASHION. THAT IS THE VALUE. AND RIGHT NOW THIS WAS IN MY ESTIMATION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE VOTERS WERE TOLD SOMETHING AGAIN YOU WERE ACTUALLY CORRECT THEY WERE VERY FORTHCOMING SAYING THAT ONLY NINE BILLION DOLLARS WAS GOING TO BE ALLOCATED GEO MONEY. A BOND MONEY BUT WE NEVER GOT A PRIVATE PARTNER THE WANTED TO TAKE ON THIS RISK BECAUSE OF THIS PROJECTS ENORMOUS RISK AND- SO THE BRUNT OF THE PROJECT IS BEING PAID FOR CAP AND TRADE FOR THEM WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SECURE SOME ARE AMONG THE AND IN. SOME FEDERAL MONEY BUT ON THE V. THE ABSOLUTE. ROAD THAT THIS IS TAKEN- THERE'S NOT A PRIVATE ENTITY ONCE IN SUCH AS WITH A TEN FOOT POLE WITH A RISK OF CONSTRUCTION AND WE HAVE VERSION IS GOING OUT AND DOING THEIR PROJECT IN THEIR TIME LINES ABSOLUTELY BLOW US WE KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE ACQUISITION BECAUSE THEY'RE IN THE RIGHT AWAY ALREADY- OF- OF. OVER A CHOIR OF PARCELS ON YOUR OWN THE- BUT- IN THIS PROJECT- IN A REALLY NEEDS TO. HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON REEVALUATE AND AGAIN I'M I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE INTENDING TO SPEND. ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE CAN BYHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLDS. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ALL BRAND NEW ELECTRIC CARS. SERIOUSLY AND SO ON AND THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE A BUS CONNECTION AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A TRAIN CONNECTION. IN AT THE END AT THIS POINT TIME SO. AGAIN WE KNOW MAY ELEVENTH ARMY. I JUST WOULD BE CONCERNED THEY'LL SIT IN TRAFFIC ON I. NINETY NINE. YEAH I MEAN NO THE AND THE AYE. ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM HERE IS TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW OF FASTER MOBILITY OPTION FOR FOLKS THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THEM TO SIT IN. JOKE IN- CONGESTION. AND SO AGAIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN I YOU KNOW I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU WANT US TO EXPLORE GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION ON I DO THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THERE HAS TO BE A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS A CONTINUED WILL- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO UP A BILL THIS PROJECT AND- AND NOT FOR MY MONEY I CERTAINLY HOPE THERE IS- BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S THE MOST TRANSFORMATIVE THING I'VE SEEN IN MY CAREER- IN TERMS OF WHAT IT CAN DO AND I UNDERSTAND pNOBODY WHO WISHES WE COULD BUILD MORE THAN ME IN TERMS OF A BIGGER SEGMENT IN A SEGMENT THAT COULD REACH MORE PLACES BUT I AM CONSTRAINED BY AVAILABLE MONEY. AND SO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WITH THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE- I SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR IS NOT JUST. THIS ELECTRIFIED SECTION BETWEEN THESE TWO CITIES. BUT IT IS ALSO COMPLETING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK. ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO LA IN ANAHEIM. COMPLETING ALL OF THE BOOK AND PROJECTS OF BOTH LA- AND THE BAY AREA- AND ONCE THAT IS DONE. I THINK WE CAN REALLY START TO DE REST. WHAT THE REST OF THE REST OF THE PROJECT IS. GONNA LOOK LIKE AND THEN I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY WILL NOT SEE PRIVATE MONEY. A COME IN I THINK WE HAVE TO GET SOME OF THIS RISK OUT OF THE WAY- AND THAT'S ONLY A CHEAT BY. WORK YEAH AND I YOU KNOW AGAIN CONTINGENCIES A RISK TO ME AND I WAS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE YEARS. CONTINGENCY IN REST MEANS MISTAKES MISTAKES MADE. AND OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT WARRANT NAILED DOWN. WHEN YOU MADE THIS. COMMENT THAT. THIS PROJECT WILL LET YOU KNOW LATER WHAT IT COSTS. I'M NEVER APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTION PROJECT WITH WHERE THE- OWNER HAS TOLD ME. YOU KNOW TELL ME WHAT. TELL ME WHAT IT WILL COST ME LATER GET STARTED. JUST IT'S JUST NOT IT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- AND SERIOUSLY- WHEN I LOOK AT THE BUSINESS PLAN IN THE CONTINGENCIES AND RISK FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. ALMOST DOUBLE THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROJECT HIMSELF. AND SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT PATTING YOUR NUMBERS FOR MISTAKES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND WHAT WE USED TO CALL OKEY DOKE IN THE IN THE INDUSTRY. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF OKEY DOKE SCUM IN OUR WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE AND- WE FEEL. WE FEEL IT. YOU KNOW. THE AUTHORITY- ONLY COMES TO US FOR MONEY. WHEN THEY NEED IT WE FEEL THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE OT PART OF PARTNER OF. SHARE THAT WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE THE SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION- GOING FORWARD IT'S JUST IT'S A WE DON'T HEAR FROM THE AGENCY AT ALL. AND ONLY WHEN IS THIS TIME AS WE HAVE OUR TIME OF THAT. IN PUBLIC. YOU KNOW AND SO AND ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS I DO HAVE HIS IT'LL HOW MUCH IS- THE LITIGATION COSTS BEEN TO DATE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LITIGATING. FOR RIGHT AWAY AND ALL THESE OTHER THINGS I MEAN THIS IS MY DIRECT A GOING AWAY FROM THE PROJECT AND HOW MUCH IS. ANTICIPATED FOR LEAD- LITIGATION- GOING FORWARD. OFF TO GET THAT FOR YOU I DON'T HAVE THAT FOR ME OKAY I HAVE ONLY ONE MORE QUESTION ON THAT NOTE. N. IS CHANGE ORDERS TODAY FROM DAY ONE WHAT HOW MUCH HAVE THE CHANGE ORDERS ADDED UP TO. OF GOING FORWARD. FOR ME THE ORIGINAL ONTRACT PRICE AND HOW MANY CHANGE ORDERS HAVE BEEN ISSUED WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL- BECAUSE AGAIN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS DESIGNED. BUILDING A LOT OF FACETS AND- ALL OF A SUDDEN WE'RE SEEING COST OVER RUNS. AND BE HELPFUL TO KNOW KIND OF IN OUR ROLE OF OVERSIGHT. WHY AND YEAH AND WHERE. YEAH OF MISTER CHAIRMAN WILL GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU AS WELL A CHANGE ORDERS WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON OUR- WEBSITE TODAY BUT WE WILL- PUT TOGETHER- THAT INFORMATION AND- AND- AND PUT IN FRONT OF YOU AGAIN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AND I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS FROM YOUR- EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA BUT- YOU KNOW IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TO. GET INTO CONSTRUCTION AND MAKE COMMITMENTS ON SCHEDULES OF BEFORE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AWAY IN HAND AND I THINK THAT THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY- THE REASON THERE HAS BEEN. A DELAYS AND COST OF THIS PROJECT AND- AND SO- YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD WE'RE TRYING TO. GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THAT. GET OUR SCHEDULES- CONFIRM BASED ONLY KNOW THE RIGHT WILL BE AVAILABLE. THE END UP BEFORE THAT FASHION BUT I WILL. I WILL GETTO YOU THE- ACOSTA CHANGE ORDER. A NUMBERS THAT YOU REQUEST RICHARD THAT I JUST HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION RENDON. AND YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK. A CERTAIN. SO YOU MENTION YOUR TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF THE TO THE TRANSPORTATION ARENA. AND YEAH YOU WORK AS A STAFFER. IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THEN SECRETARY TRANSPORTATION HOW MANY YEARS OF CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE DO YOU HAVE. TO RUN THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. IN CALIFORNIA. WELL AS A PROJECT MANAGER AT ARPANET EARLIER ENGINEER. WHAT I I'VE STE MISTER CHAIRMAN I STEP I PUT I'VE SPENT MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE IN PUBLIC SERVICE. AND HAS BEEN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE. IN DOING TRANSPORTATION POLICY THAT INVOLVED SOME OF THE OTHER LARGEST TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN THE HISTORY OF THE STATE. OF THAT THAT IS WHAT I'VE SPENT MY TIME. DOING AND- AND- AND LEARNED QUITE A BIT ABOUT TRANSPORTATION FINANCE. THE TRANSPORTATION CONSTRUCTION. AND THOSE THINGS. AND SO- YOU KNOW I COULD DO THIS JOB AND I BROUGHT IN EXPERTISE. ON MY MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE DECADES OF THAT EXPERIENCE. MY CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER IS ONE I WOULD POINT TO- AND OTHERS AS WELL- AND SO I'VE IMPROVE MY MANAGEMENT TEAM IN THAT REGARD. FROM WHERE THE- I WAIT A HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY WAS BEFORE. AND I BRING TO THIS JOB. MY EXPERIENCE WHICH IS A DIFFERENT BUT I THINK EQUALLY IMPORTANT. A TO SEE THE PROJECT BEFORE. APPRECIATE THAT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BECAUSE- YOU KNOW. IN MY ESTIMATION AND MY ROLE IN EIGHT YEARS I'VE SEEN. CALIFORNIA HASN'T ON MEGA PROJECTS WELL. THE BAY BRIDGE WAS KIND OF A OF. PROJECT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE A WHOLE LOT BETTER AND- AND NOW NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT IN IS THE COST OVER RUNS AND- AND THE YEAH I GUESS THE ANTICIPATION A GETTING STARTED YOU KNOW AND- AND PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE- NOT ACQUIRING RIGHT AWAY. HAS BEEN COST TO THE TAXPAYERS HUGE SUM OF MONEY BUT THEN YOU ALSO LOOK AT A PROJECT IS COMING DOWN THE PIKE WITH THIS TUNNEL PROJECT AND CONVEYANCE. IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THESE PROJECTS WELL AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO. SOME KIND OF PROCESS BEING PUT IN PLACE WHERE THERE'S A CHECK AND BALANCE SYSTEM A BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. I DON'T FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT OF THIS AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT. THEY'RE DOING EVERYTHING RIGHT. AND SO I'M MISTER KELLY APPRECIATE YOU YOU TOOK A ROLL IT. IS CONTROVERSIAL AND I HOPE THAT YOU WERE- SUCCESSFUL IN AND BRING IT BACK TO. WHAT THE VOTERS AND HOPE FOR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. IF SO WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO A PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO THE MODERATOR. MODERATOR. A LADY GERMAN ON THE PHONE LINES HE'D LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT YOU CAN IN THE QUEUE BY PRESSING ONE ZERO OPERATE WILL THEN PROVIDE YOU A NUMBER AND I WILL. ANNOUNCE YOU BY THAT NUMBER. YOU ARE SO FIRST- WE WILL GO TO NUMBER SIXTY THREE SIXTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WITHOUT ROBINSON ON BEHALF OF THE FRESNO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MIKE LEONARDO- WE SUPPORT THE PROJECT. IS PROPOSED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUSINESS PLAN BY CONTINUING THE WORK AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY TOWARDS THE FIRST SEGMENT OF FULLY ELECTRIFIED HIGH SPEED RAIL IN CALIFORNIA. THIS HAS BEEN THE DIRECTION OF THE AUTHORITY SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. AND SCALING BACK THAT WORK IN THE VALUE AT THIS JUNCTURE WE BELIEVE WOULD BECAUSE OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO A REGION THAT DURING THE LAST RECESSION HAD SOME OF THE WORST UNEMPLOYMENT THE COUNTRY. WE ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE MAINTAIN THE COMMITMENT TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY ABOUT ONE IN THEIR FORTIES BUSINESS PLAN THE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION TODAY THANK YOU SIR. CHECK OUT ALL NEXT. NUMBER NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK OF MY NAME IS RICK HARNISCH AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL ALLIANCE WERE A MEMBER MEMBER SUPPORTED NONPROFIT ADVOCATING FOR FAST FRIEDMAN AFFORDABLE TRAINS OF ALL KINDS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY- WE URGE THE STATE TAKE TO. WORK AGGRESSIVELY TO COMPLETE ELECTRIFIED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY MILE AN HOUR HIGH SPEED LINE LINKING DOWNTOWN BAKERSFIELD OR MERCED. CAN BEGIN OPERATIONS ON THAT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- THIS IS THE BEST FIRST BUILDING BLOCK TOWARDS A HIGH SPEED LINE THAT WOULD LINK LA AND SAN FRANCISCO IN UNDER THREE HOURS IT WILL IN ITS INITIAL FORM- BUILD NEW LINKAGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BY CONNECTING WITH ALREADY EXISTING AND EXPANDED TRAINS AND BUSES THAT WILL LINK AT ALL OF THE HIGH SPEED STATIONS. THERE IS ALREADY A LOT OF TRANSFERS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE SAN JOAQUIN TO CONNECTING BUSES AND OTHER TRAINS. THIS WILL MAKE THOSE SERVICES MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE AND MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO OPERATE FOR THE STATE. THE OTHER THING THE FOCUSING ON THIS HIGH SPEED LINE WILL DO WILL DRIVE REGULATORY INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS. THAT ONLY OCCUR IN AS YOU ARE ACTUALLY MOVING UP PROJECTS THROUGH COMPLETION. SO YOU'VE ALREADY ACCOMPLISHED SOME OF THOSE THINGS IN TERMS OF PERSUADING THE OFFER A TO- ADOPT NEW TRAIN SEC REGULATIONS- ISSUES WITH ESTABLISHING NEW ELECTRIFICATION- AND ONE KEY INNOVATION COULD BE. CREATING EITHER BETTER CONNECTIONS- THREE THROUGH SERVICE THAT ISN'T QUITE TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE YEP BUT COULD BE BY THE TIME IS BUILT IF YOU'RE FOCUSED ON. CALIFORNIA IS A FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A STRONG GREEN ECONOMIC CONNECTIONS- IT'LL LOOK MUCH LOWER IMPACT AND DOING OTHER MODES. AND AGAIN PLEASE SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY BY COMPLETING ELECTRIFIED- BAKERSFIELD MERCED HIGH SPEED LINE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. NEXT WE'LL GO TO NUMBER EIGHTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO BOB GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR FRAZIER AND MANY MEMBERS- MY NAME'S STEWART FLASHMAN I'M AN ATTORNEY I SENT YOU A LETTER- THIS MORNING VIA THE- THE CONDUIT AND- I'M GOING TO VERY BRIEFLY GO OVER A FEW OF THE KEY PARTS OF THAT LETTER. IN IN POINT I WANTED TO MAKE IN MY TESTIMONY IS THAT WHAT YOU. ARE NEW HERE DODD VIA A POPCORN A AND- THERE'S. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF. BUT THEN HE DID IS SPONSORING A LEGAL CHALLENGE I'M ALSO IS. GEN I'M HEIDI RAIL AND EXPLICATION LUCIEN'S DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND BOTH OF WHOM HAVE ALSO BEEN INVOLVED IN LITIGATION AGAINST THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. CAN YOU GET ME THE VISUALS THAT ARE. ALLEN DURING THE AUTHORITY FOR THIS PROPERTY. AND I'M AFRAID TO ADD TO YOUR--POINTED OUT OF THREE- BY ONE OF YOUR ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- THE LANGUAGE IN THE BALLOT MEASURES SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT A **** THE PART THAT THE PLAN PASSENGER TRAIN SERVICE WE PROVIDE ORLOFF WHO IS PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY WILL NOT REQUIRE OPERATING SUBSIDIES. NOW THE PURSUANT TO ITS AUTHORITY WAS MENTIONED BY PEOPLE BUT WHAT WE ARE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OPPOSITE. AUTHORITY IS THAT. HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS EXCLUSIVE AUTHORITY. TO RUN TRAINING OVER A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILES PER HOUR SO EVEN IF THE AUTHORITY DELEGATE THAT RESPONSIBILITY. TO ANOTHER AGENCY THAT AGENCY IS DOING OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SERVICE PURSUANT TO A PARTY IS A PARTY. AND THAT PROHIBITED BY THE BOND MEASURE. GOING TO ANOTHER AGENCY AND RENTING THE FACILITIES OUT THIS MARKET TO AROUND THE PROBLEM DESPITE WHAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY MADE THINGS AND I WOULD URGE YOU TO SEEK AN INDEPENDENT LEGAL THIS IS LEGAL OPINION ON THIS PERHAPS FOR EXAMPLE BY GOING INTO THE COURTS. FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND GETTING THE COURTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WHAT THEY WANT TO DO GUEST LEGAL OR NOT OTHERWISE YOU ARE TAKING AN ENORMOUS RISK WITH TAXPAYER MONEY. ONE OF THE- MENTION IN TERMS OF TORNADOES THAT COULD BE LOOKED AT AFTER TEN YEARS AGO THE- SYSTEM ASSN YEAH. ALREADY ABOUT DOING A HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. AND THE AUTHORITY PUSH THEM OFF BY SAYING NO WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN DOING WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WE ONLY WANT YOU TO DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO. I THINK IT MIGHT BE WORTH REVISITING ALTERNATIVE PLANS AND A PRIVATE PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY TO WHAT THE AUTHORITY IS PROPOSING BUT BEING THAT WOULD PREVENT I SPEED RAIL SERVICE ACROSS THE STATE. EXCERPTED. NEXT WILL BE NUMBER ONE OH FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD.

SIXTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. I'M DAVID SHOWN BROWN PRESIDENT OF THE TRAIN WRITERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA IN THE CURRENT ISSUE OF CALIFORNIA REAL NEWS OUR NEWSPAPER I HAVE A LONG ARTICLE ON THE DISMAL FUTURE AHEAD FOR HIGH SPEED RAIL IT'S BEEN EMAILED TO THE COMMITTEE AND HOPEFULLY FORWARDED TO EACH OF THE MEMBERS. WE ARE LONGTIME SUPPORTERS OF HSR BUT ALSO HAVE LONG OPPOSED THIS SPECIFIC HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT WE SEE IT AS UNLIKELY TO EVER PROVIDE USEFUL SERVICE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHY THERE'S NO PRIVATE MONEY IN THE PROJECT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE VIEWS OF THE CHAIR AND MISTER KELLY. IT'S NOT THE RISK IT'S THE IT'S THAT THE POLITICAL COMPROMISES ON ROUTE DESIGN WERE MADE EARLY IN THE PROJECTS HISTORY THEY'RE GOING TO PREVENT IT FROM EVER TURNING AN OPERATING PROJECT BECAUSE OF THAT THERE WILL NEVER BE PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN THIS PROJECT WHICH IS WHY IT IS ULTIMATELY IN FEASIBLE. THE IDEA THAT THE STATE SHOULD BE THE SOLE FUNDER OF A MERCED TO BAKERSFIELD WINE IS NOT ONLY RIDICULOUS IT'S NOW IN FEASIBLE DUE TO THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS. EVEN IF THAT PROJECT WAS SOMEHOW COMPLETED IT WOULD STILL BE COMMERCIALLY MEANINGLESS AS THERE WON'T BE ANY PROFIT. IN MY ARTICLE I LAY OUT IN ORDER LEE PLANNED TO CAN COMPLETE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT ONE IN THE FRESNO AREA AND THEN SHUT DOWN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT. THE ARTICLE OFFERS A SERIES OF IDEAS ON HOW TO SPEND CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO PRODUCE FAR HIGHER RAIL RIDERSHIP. ONE POINT I'D LIKE TO STRESS FOR MY ARTICLE WE BELIEVE THAT CHS SURREY'S INSISTENCE ON SIGNING A CONTRACT FOR ELECTRIFICATION IS THE DIRECT BEAR TO THIS COMMITTEE. THEY'RE QUESTIONING WHETHER YOU HAVE THE POLITICAL COURAGE TO ORDER THEM TO NOT PROCEED WITH THE CONTRACT. RACH URGES THE COMMITTEE TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION INDICATING ITS UNWILLINGNESS TO FUND ELECTRIFICATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY TRACKS AT THIS TIME. I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT WILL GO TO NUMBER FIFTY TWO PLEASE GO AHEAD.

AND I'M GONNA TAKE EVERYBODY'S OF FOR CALLING IN AND WAITING PATIENTLY TO SHARE THEIR COMMENTS AND THEIR- THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMENTS ABOUT THE PROJECT. AND THEIR SUPPORT ALSO- I THINK WHAT I WANTED TO START OFF WITH IS NOBODY IS SAYING THIS PROJECT SHOULD MOVE FORWARD. AND HOUSE MOVES FORWARD AND HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT. BUT TODAY I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE OF EVERYONE'S PARTICIPATION IN THE HEARING WILL THINK STAFF FOR BEING HERE LATE. I FRANK THANK YOU KNOW I REALLY CAN'T CONTAIN MY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS GRAPH BUSINESS PLAN. IT'S CLEAR TO ME THAT IT'S BASED. LIFE I GUESS I SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED EVERY BUSINESS PLAN THAT I'VE SEEN TO DATE HAS A BUILT ON MISLEADING OR OUTRIGHT INACCURATE INFORMATION IT HAS NOT. EVER BEEN ATTAINED. I'M DONE. THIS HAS TO STOP. IF WE WERE CONSTRAINED BY THE CURRENT GLOBAL PANDEMIC I WOULD SCHEDULE MORE HEARINGS TO REALLY DIG INTO THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE CULTURE PROBLEMS OF AN ORGANIZATION SEEMS HELL BENT ON BUILDING ELECTRIC TRAIN WHETHER IT'S- WHETHER OR NOT IT'S GOOD FOR CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT TO GET REAL ABOUT THIS PROJECT BEFORE IT GETS TOO LATE. IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DISCUSS WAYS TO CHANGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE AUTHORITY. THIS PROJECT SHOULD BE MANAGED BY A DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY ANSWERABLE TO THIS AGENCY SECRETARY AND THE GOVERNOR. AND SUCCESS AND FAILURE SHOULD DIRECTLY REFLECT ON THE ADMINISTRATION NOT ON ON ACCOUNTABLE BOARD. AS IT STANDS THE LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY FEELS TOO MUCH LIKE THE CONSULTANTS ARE RUNNING THE SHOW AND NO ONE IS LOOKING OUT. ON THE STATE'S BEHALF. UNFORTUNATELY MY COLOR COLLEAGUES AND I NEED TO WRESTLE WITH EVEN BIGGER CHALLENGE IS TODAY. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS TOPIC WILL GET TO THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES RIGHT NOW. KIND OF DISAPPOINTING. BUT BELIEVE ME WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES I'M GOING TO DO ALL I CAN TO GET THIS PROJECT BACK ON TRACK I HOPE ONLY HOPE. THAT IT WILL BE TOO LATE. I REALLY DO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR JOINING ME TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH HIM ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. AGAIN WE'RE NOT TRYING TO STOP THIS PROJECT WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT DONE RIGHT THAT IS OUR ROLE AS LEGISLATORS. AND OVERSIGHT OF THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU FOR ALL FOR COMING THIS HEARING TODAY. BUT LOOK THIS HIGH SPEED RAIL PROGRAM IS ONE LARGEST INSTRUCT INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. AS SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN IN A CONSTRUCTION A GENERAL CONTRACTOR ALMOST MY ENTIRE LIFE. IF I WANTED TO SEE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT COMPLETED AS EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE I WILL PUT SOMEONE WITH CONSTRUCTION EXPERIENCE IN% CHARGE OF IT SUCH A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE. INSTEAD THE ADMINISTRATION HIRED A LEGISLATIVE STAFF PERSON TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF THIS ORGANIZATION. HE'S A VERY NICE MAN. IT'S CLEAR THAT THEY HIRE THIS PERSON NOT BECAUSE HE CAN ENSURE THAT THE PROJECT IS BUILT WELL AND THE STATE'S MONEY IS BEING SPENT THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE IT'S BECAUSE HIS EXPERT EXPERTISE IS TO CONVINCE THE LEGISLATURE TO DO WHAT HE OF THE GOVERNOR WANT THEM TO DO. JUST PUSH THE PROJECT FOR. I FRANKLY CANNOT TAKE SERIOUSLY ANY PLAN TO TRY TO SELL ME ON ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS WHEN THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT BEING PROPOSED. I HOPE THE AUTHORITY. AFTER MUCH. CONSIDERATION IN HEARING THE LA- THE PEER REVIEW GROUP GROUP SENDS THE BUSINESS PLAN BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD WITH MORE REALISTIC APPROACH AND I'LL BE WRITING A LETTER TO THE AUTHORITIES SAY THAT I DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS PLAN I BELIEVE IT'S MISSTATING FACTS AND I WANT TO SEE REAL NUMBERS. I'M ALL ABOUT PEOPLE GOING TO WORK. IN SUPPORT OF THAT I'VE BEEN THE CARPENTERS UNION MOST OF MY LIFE. BUT I DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE PEOPLE'S MONEY TO SPEND IF THE MONEY IS SPENT ELSEWHERE ON A BETTER VALUE. PEOPLE STILL WILL GO TO WORK. WITH THAT MAJOR IN THIS SERIES THANK YOU.
