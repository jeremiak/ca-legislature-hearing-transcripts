WERE OPEN AS OF JUNE. AS OF

00:55:00.363 --> 00:55:06.202

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. YES

00:55:09.439 --> 00:55:10.407
SIR I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF MY

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.976
FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON IN

00:55:13.043 --> 00:55:15.078
THESE BUDGET DISCUSSIONS IS WE

00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.479
HEAR A LOT ABOUT THESE KIND OF

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:20.183
BIG NEW BUDGET PROPOSALS- YOU

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:22.752
KNOW TAKING CENTER STAGE BUT

00:55:22.819 --> 00:55:24.120
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:25.422
EXISTING PROGRAMMING I MEAN

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:26.990
THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME

00:55:27.057 --> 00:55:28.391
ISSUES WE'VE BEEN TALKING

00:55:28.458 --> 00:55:30.560
ABOUT- YOU KNOW. FOR AS LONG AS

00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:31.327
I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE

00:55:31.394 --> 00:55:32.996
ABOUT HOW DO WE IMPROVE WHAT WE

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:36.633
HAVE ALREADY- AND I THINK THAT

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.002
SHOULD BE A BIG BIG FOCUS HERE-

00:55:39.069 --> 00:55:40.904
IN ADDITION PANDEMIC POLICIES

00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:43.106
MAY ACTUALLY BE CONTRIBUTING TO

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.709
LIMITED ACCESS IN CHILD CARE

00:55:45.775 --> 00:55:47.210
THIS IS THE SHORTAGE OF CHILD

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.945
CARE PROVIDERS WHICH PRECEDED

00:55:49.012 --> 00:55:51.414
COVERT NINETEEN. HAS HAS ONLY

00:55:51.481 --> 00:55:54.884
BECOME WORSE. ADD IN THIS LAST

00:55:54.951 --> 00:55:56.453
YEAR AND LIKE EDUCATION

00:55:56.519 --> 00:55:58.188
RESTAURANTS IN OTHER SECTORS

00:55:58.254 --> 00:55:59.889
WHEN GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:02.158
PAY WITHOUT REQUIRING WORK. OR

00:56:02.225 --> 00:56:04.394
SUBSIDIZES REDUCED WORKING

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:06.062
LEVELS GUESS WHAT WE HAVE. A

00:56:06.129 --> 00:56:08.965
LABOR SHORTAGE. THE SO CALLED

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.900
HARD HOLD HARMLESS POLICIES MAY

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:12.936
ACTUALLY BE DOING MORE HARM.

00:56:13.002 --> 00:56:14.337
CREATING DISINCENTIVES FOR

00:56:14.404 --> 00:56:16.506
CHILD CARE PROVIDERS TO OFFER

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:19.042
AND RECIPIENTS TO ACCESS. AND

00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:21.311
FULLY UTILIZE CHILD CARE. THE

00:56:21.377 --> 00:56:22.645
LIMITED NUMBER OF AVAILABLE

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:25.014
SLOTS ARE DEEMED FULL EVEN IF

00:56:25.081 --> 00:56:27.717
NOT BEING USED. LEAVING THOSE

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:29.552
WHO ACTUALLY NEED AND WOULD USE

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:31.454
CHILD CARE ON ON WAITING LISTS

00:56:31.521 --> 00:56:33.289
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW ANY OF THESE

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.024
PROPOSALS IN THE MAY REVISE

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.126
WILL ACTUALLY REVERSE THIS

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:38.228
TREND AND ATTRACT THE THOUSANDS

00:56:38.294 --> 00:56:39.629
OF QUALIFIED NEW PROVIDERS

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.564
NEEDED. I THINK THAT IS LIKE

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:43.299
FRONT ROW CENTER WHAT WE NEED

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:46.770

THE HUNDRED CASE THOUGHT THAT

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.193

STABILIZING THE FIELD AS WELL

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:26.436
AS THE- CHILD CARE. INITIATIVE

00:58:26.502 --> 00:58:29.172

THE STATE THAT WE THINK AND

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.479
THERE ARE PROVIDERS TO MEET

00:58:36.546 --> 00:58:37.547

WE'VE LOST WE HAD. A BUNCH OF

00:58:59.769 --> 00:59:00.303
THESE CHILD CARE CENTERS CLOSE

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:04.641
DOWN- YOU'RE DOING A HOLD

00:59:04.707 --> 00:59:07.777
HARMLESS POLICY WHICH PAYS THEM

00:59:07.844 --> 00:59:08.311
WHAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

CURRENT LABOR SHORTAGE THAT

00:59:24.027 --> 00:59:27.830

SIXTEEN DAYS. SO THAT IS

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.461
SPECIFIC TO CRISES THAT MIGHT

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.862
BE HAPPENING RELATED TO THE

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:29.031
PANDEMIC AND IT IS A- LIMITED

01:04:29.098 --> 01:04:31.434

THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO THAT

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.354
FACT IF YOU'RE HOLDING IT OPEN

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.755
FOR A KID WHO'S NOT ATTENDING

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:54.290
THAT MEANS SOME OTHER KID AND

01:04:54.357 --> 01:04:55.758

THEY'RE ON THE WAITING LIST.

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.032

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.526
GIVERS- IS NOT EASY. SO WHAT IS

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.861
THE PLAN TO RECRUIT THEM TO

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:07.296
EVEN IF YOU ARE A PROVIDER THAT

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.764
WANTS TO OPEN. AND YOU'RE

01:06:08.831 --> 01:06:11.434
APPROVED FOR FORTY EIGHT SLOTS-

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.201
CAN YOU HIRE THE TEACHERS TO

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.270
MEET RATIOS- THESE ARE SOME OF

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.204
THE THINGS THAT I THINK MY

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.572
COLLEAGUE IS LOOKING TO SEE. IF

01:06:16.639 --> 01:06:18.407
WE WANT TO GET TO A HUNDRED

01:06:18.474 --> 01:06:19.442
THOUSAND WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:21.610
ACTUAL PLAN- FOR ACTUALLY

01:06:21.677 --> 01:06:24.547
OPENING DOORS AT CENTERS. AND

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.550
PAIRING FAMILIES ABOUT WITH

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:30.019
PROVIDERS. WITH RESPECT TO

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:31.454
LICENSE CAPACITY I THINK IT'S

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.022
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE

01:06:33.089 --> 01:06:34.657
AT THIS POINT ARE ALMOST ABOUT

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.493
A NET ZERO. AND IN TERMS OF THE

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.595
LAST AND THE GAINES SO WE HAVE

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.796
WE HAVE LOST SIGNIFICANT

01:06:40.863 --> 01:06:42.898
CAPACITY AS YOUR KILEY DID AND

01:06:42.965 --> 01:06:43.632
WE HAVE BEEN DEEPLY CONCERNED

01:06:43.699 --> 01:06:46.068
ABOUT. THAT BUT AT THE SAME

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:47.236
TIME WE HAVE POP UP CENTERS

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:48.938
THAT HAVE. BEGUN AND WE ARE

01:06:49.004 --> 01:06:51.640
TRANSITIONING THEM FLEXING AND

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:52.208
WE'VE HAD NEW PROVIDER. ARE

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:53.542
COMING AND THAT THOSE ARE A

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:55.478
VERY MINOR CHANGE IN THE

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:57.546
OVERALL FEEL. HAVING SAID THAT

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.482
WE HAVE BOB I WANTED TO

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.584
INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.119
QUALITY CHILD CARE AND THERE

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.320
ARE INVESTMENTS IN THE BUDGET

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.589
BUT ALSO DO FOCUS. ON HOW. THE

01:07:06.655 --> 01:07:08.023
CHILD CARE INITIATIVE PROJECT

01:07:08.090 --> 01:07:09.992
IN PARTICULAR THAT FUNDING IS

01:07:10.059 --> 01:07:12.128
INTENDED IT DOES INCLUDE. BOTH

01:07:12.194 --> 01:07:14.196
OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE TO FOR

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.464
PROVIDERS TO ASSIST THEM WITH

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.266
BECOMING LICENSE. AND THEN WE

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:20.302
ALSO HAVE THE NON LICENSE OR

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.670
LICENSE EXEMPT. CARE THAT IS

01:07:21.737 --> 01:07:23.072
PROVIDED SO I HOPE THOSE ARE

01:07:23.139 --> 01:07:25.608
HELPFUL CLARIFICATIONS TO-

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:28.043
PRESIDENTIAL CONTACTS BUT- EVEN

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:28.878
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:32.648
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES WE DO

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.149
ALSO HAVE GROWTH THAT'S

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:35.384
HAPPENING AT THE- OKAY LAST

01:07:35.451 --> 01:07:41.157
LAST QUESTION HERE. IS. YEAH WE

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.759
PROPOSED FOR TKA OF WHICH-

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:46.695
WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF WE'VE DONE

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:50.933
A FOUR POINT 005% COAL INCREASE

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.535
AND HERE WE'RE DOING A ONE

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:54.937
POINT 7% CALL INCREASE SO WHEN

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:58.207
YOU WHEN YOU'RE- DURING A VERY

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.009
MINIMAL CALL INCREASE AND NO

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:04.980
RATE INCREASE. RIGHT. IS THAT

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:08.617
PROBLEMATIC TO. ENSURING THAT

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:09.685
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE KIND OF

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:12.955
PROVIDERS THAT WE NEED. EVEN

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:16.392
JUST AN EXISTING PROGRAM. THE

01:08:16.459 --> 01:08:23.265
MAN. IS THAT A PART IN A

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:27.036
FINANCE. OR WHOEVER WOULD LIKE

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:27.703

01:08:42.117 --> 01:08:43.252
BIT. YEAH WOULD THE REGIONAL

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:37.600
THE PROBLEMATIC THINGS WE'VE

01:10:37.666 --> 01:10:39.835
BEEN TALKING ABOUT RATES. YOU

HAPPENING I KNOW ON OUR END-

01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:55.985
AND WE'VE SEEN THE NEED FOR IT

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:57.086
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ATTRACT.

01:10:57.152 --> 01:11:00.990

OUR BUDGET IS ADDRESSING THE

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:15.604
RATES BECAUSE IF YOU WANT TO

WE HAVE NOW THE NUMBER OF SLOTS

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:23.145

BETTER JOBS THAT COSCO IN AND

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:34.223

PEOPLE MAKE FINANCIAL CHOICES

01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:39.161
FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND IF. YOU

01:11:39.228 --> 01:11:40.396

YOU KNOW LIVING WAGE YOU KNOW

01:11:47.002 --> 01:11:47.903
IT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE TO SEE

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.638
WHAT HAPPENS THERE SO AND THEN

01:11:49.705 --> 01:11:51.206
WE WERE LOOKING ABOUT EXPANDING

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:54.109
BY A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:56.178

IN LESS WE ADJUST. OUR RATE

01:12:04.286 --> 01:12:05.587
STRUCTURE SIMPLIFY IT WHICH

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:06.989
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THESE.

01:12:07.056 --> 01:12:08.857

PROVIDERS OUT THERE BUT REMIND

01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:20.569
YOU THAT A LOT OF THE- CHILD

OUR OF OUR UNIONIZED WORKFORCE

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.814

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.148
LIMóN THE FROM TWO YEARS AGO

01:12:33.215 --> 01:12:34.116
AND RIGHTFULLY SO I'M GOING TO

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:35.784
DO THAT BUT- THERE'S A BIG

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:36.518
PIECE OF THE CHILD CARE FIELD

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.787

01:12:57.873 --> 01:12:58.941
DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES

COLLEAGUES TO DISCUSS THE

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.177
IMPACT ON THE OVERALL CHILD

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:05.280
CARE- SYSTEM- UNDERSTANDING OF

01:13:05.347 --> 01:13:06.615
COURSE IN THE PRESCHOOL SIDE

01:13:06.682 --> 01:13:08.751
WHICH IS WHICH I CAN SPEAK TO-

01:13:08.817 --> 01:13:10.419
THAT THERE ARE SOME TOTAL BY

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:11.920

YET FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT. A

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.457
SEPARATE FROM THOSE BASE COST

01:33:49.523 --> 01:33:50.725
THE GOVERNOR ALSO HAS A

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:51.659
PROPOSAL TO REDUCE ADULT THE

01:33:51.726 --> 01:33:53.561

FOUR TWENTY FIVE. AND UNLIKE

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:09.910
THE BASE COST THE STATE WOULD

PAY FOR THOSE COSTS WITHIN

01:34:11.278 --> 01:34:12.813

PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:15.683
GUARANTEE. I'VE BEEN THINKING

01:34:15.750 --> 01:34:17.551
ABOUT RETENTION- THIS BILL

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:18.152
DECISION I THINK REALLY COMES

01:34:18.219 --> 01:34:21.188
DOWN TO- THE TRADEOFF- AND YOUR

01:34:21.255 --> 01:34:23.190
PRIORITIES WITHIN THE BROADER

01:34:23.257 --> 01:34:24.925
STATE BUDGET CONTEXT- I

01:34:24.992 --> 01:34:25.960
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:28.329
PREVENTION IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE

01:34:28.396 --> 01:34:28.729
IS ALLOWABLE B THE

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:31.032
CONSTITUTION. WE DON'T THINK

01:34:31.098 --> 01:34:34.001
IT'S- THAT REQUIRED IT WOULDN'T

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:35.803
HAVE TO DO IT. WHAT IT REALLY

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.738
MEANS IS THAT OVER TIME THE

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:38.539
STATE WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND

01:34:38.606 --> 01:34:40.641
MORE ON PROPOSITION NINETY

01:34:40.708 --> 01:34:42.443
EIGHT PROGRAMS. AND LESS ON NON

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.444
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:34:43.511 --> 01:34:45.813
PROGRAMS AND SO- THAT'S JUST

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.448
SOMETHING PRETTY TO THINK ABOUT

01:34:47.515 --> 01:34:51.986
IN. DEVELOPING. A MULTI YEAR

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.789
STRUCTURE OF THIS BUDGET. HI

01:34:54.855 --> 01:35:00.661
THERE TWO POINT SIX- FOR. THIS

01:35:00.728 --> 01:35:02.530
YEAR'S BUDGET- THIS IS FINDING

01:35:02.596 --> 01:35:04.298
THAT WOULD DRAW FROM A COUPLE

01:35:04.365 --> 01:35:05.666
DIFFERENT POTS OF FEDERAL

01:35:05.733 --> 01:35:07.401
FUNDING AND SIX HUNDRED MILLION

01:35:07.468 --> 01:35:08.302
WHAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.303
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.639
FUNDING- FOR THIS TARGETED

01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:13.407
INTERVENTION GRANT DISTRICTS

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:14.875
COULD USE THE FUNDS TO PAY FOR

01:35:14.942 --> 01:35:18.012
A- WIDE VARIETY OF SERVICES.

01:35:18.079 --> 01:35:19.513
INTENSIVE TUTORING ADDITIONAL

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:22.583
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME- OTHER TEXAS

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:26.220
SUPPORTS BY THE FEDERAL OF THIS.

01:35:26.287 --> 01:35:28.689
COULD BE USED TO REMEMBER SIX-

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:30.157
BACK TO THE STATE OF THE PANDA.

01:35:30.224 --> 01:35:33.127
OR EXPENSE- THE STATE. COULD BE

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:36.097
USED FOR X. JUST INCUR AFTER.

01:35:36.163 --> 01:35:44.772
JULY FIRST OF. TWO TWENTY ONE.

01:35:44.839 --> 01:35:46.340
I TURNED INTO A ASSESSMENT WE

01:35:46.407 --> 01:35:49.810
THINK THIS IS HAS SOMEONE FOR.

01:35:49.877 --> 01:35:51.345
SO IT DOES INCLUDE SOMETHING

01:35:51.412 --> 01:35:52.313
AUGMENTATION FOR AREAS THAT

01:35:52.379 --> 01:35:53.514
HAVE BEEN. A LEGISLATIVE

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:56.250
PRIORITIES A NUMBER OF YEARS I

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:57.384
THE BEST THING OF THE ARE

01:35:57.451 --> 01:35:59.987
INCREASE RIGHT HI THE INCREASES.

01:36:00.054 --> 01:36:03.224
FOR ACTORS AND LEARNING TIME.

01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:05.826
AND THEN ADDITIONAL. I THIS

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:09.830
SUPPORT. I STRUCTURALLY THIS

01:36:09.897 --> 01:36:11.599
BUT ALSO. A LARGE ONE TIME

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:14.235
BECAUSE- OF THE KICKOFF. THE

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:18.405
CPAS. US. TO TWENTY ONE FOR

01:36:18.472 --> 01:36:18.973
TWO. I'M MORE THAN FOUR TWO

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:21.008
BILLION IN FOUR ONE TEN

01:36:21.075 --> 01:36:23.077
ACTIVITY. AND COMBINING THAT

01:36:23.144 --> 01:36:25.646
AMOUNT WITH THE PROPER NINETY

01:36:25.713 --> 01:36:28.315
EIGHT WITH DEPART. AND SOMEONE

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:30.417
TEN COMMITTEE CALL SPEND. THIS

01:36:30.484 --> 01:36:33.187
BUDGET AT THE TONE ONE TIME. A

01:36:33.254 --> 01:36:35.289
NEARLY SAID BILLION. AND THAT'S

01:36:35.356 --> 01:36:36.824
IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS.

01:36:36.891 --> 01:36:39.693
BECAUSE IF THEY HEARING WORK

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.695
DROP NOT YEAR. THAT ONE TIME

01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:43.397
PRESSURE. BUT THE STATE OF

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:46.233
WAITING MAKE CUTS TO ON BLANCA.

01:36:46.300 --> 01:36:47.735
OR I MEAN. TURNING BACK TO

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:50.638
DEFER. IF THE GUARANTEE DOESN'T

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:53.507
DROP IT. THAT'S FUNNY FREE TO

01:36:53.574 --> 01:36:55.209
NEXT YEAR YOU CAN ADD USE THAT

01:36:55.276 --> 01:37:01.715
ADDRESS. A NEW ISSUE IS A QUITE.

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:03.117
AND IT INCLUDES A ONE TIME

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.485
INCENTIVE FUNDING BUT IT WASN'T

01:37:04.552 --> 01:37:06.987
CLEAR- WITH THE ADMINISTRATION

01:37:07.054 --> 01:37:07.855
THE GOVERNOR WANTED TO GO WITH

01:37:07.922 --> 01:37:10.257
THAT PROPOSAL. AND WE WEREN'T

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:10.824
SURE WHAT THE IMPLEMENTATION

01:37:10.891 --> 01:37:12.860
PLAN WAS- THIS MAY REVISION HAS

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.095
A FAIRLY AS A CLEAR END GOAL

01:37:15.162 --> 01:37:16.997
AND- A CLEAR IMPLEMENTATION

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:20.034
PLAN- THERE'S BOTH ONE TIME AND

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.101
ONGOING FUNDING THAT LINES UP

01:37:21.168 --> 01:37:25.072
WITH- THE COST DISTRICTS ONE

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:25.739
CREATED INCREASE THESE PROGRAMS.

01:37:25.806 --> 01:37:27.841
AND SO IT'S MUCH- I THINK IT'S

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:29.577
A MUCH MORE DEVELOPED A

01:37:29.643 --> 01:37:31.412
PROPOSAL- THERE ARE SOME

01:37:31.478 --> 01:37:32.446
DETAILS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.281
STILL TO THINK ABOUT LIKE. WHAT

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:34.949
WE WOULD LIKE THE STATE

01:37:35.015 --> 01:37:36.150
PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO LOOK LIKE

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:37.284
THAT PROGRAM CURRENTLY SERVES

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:39.053
MANY FOUR YEAR OLDS. I

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.354
PERSONALLY WILL SERVE MUCH

01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:42.690
FEWER OF THEM. I ONCE THAT I

01:37:42.756 --> 01:37:43.824
WILL OUT OF TRANSITIONAL

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.626
KINDERGARTEN BEGINS. BUT

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.328
OVERALL- THIS IS STRONGER

01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:49.129
PROPOSAL I THINK WE ALSO THINK

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.197
THERE'S BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS

01:37:50.264 --> 01:37:50.798
IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS

01:37:50.864 --> 01:37:52.766
PROPOSAL AND ALL OF MY

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:54.501
COLLEAGUE I TOOK A LOOK. ON MY

01:37:54.568 --> 01:37:55.369
COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT MORE

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:59.139
ABOUT THAT. IN ONE OF THE NEXT

01:37:59.206 --> 01:38:01.542
PANELS. BUT TO OUR CONCERN.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.410
GOING TO FLY. AFTER PROPOSAL

01:38:03.477 --> 01:38:04.278
FOR YOU ONE IS THE TWO POINT

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:05.746
SIX BILLION. FOR TARGETED

01:38:05.813 --> 01:38:07.214
INTERVENTION AND THE SECOND TO

01:38:07.281 --> 01:38:08.282
GET THE TWO BILLION FOR HEALTH

01:38:08.349 --> 01:38:10.351
AND SAFETY ACTIVITIES.

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.819
DISTRICTS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:12.686
MORE THAN THIRTY MILLION

01:38:12.753 --> 01:38:15.155
DOLLARS FOR. ADJUSTING LEARNING

01:38:15.222 --> 01:38:17.558
LOSS AND- HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:18.525
ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE

01:38:18.592 --> 01:38:19.994
PANDEMIC MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR

01:38:20.060 --> 01:38:23.130
BILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS MORE

01:38:23.197 --> 01:38:23.731
THAN SIX BILLION STATE FUNDS.

01:38:23.797 --> 01:38:26.000
AND THOUGH THAT EIGHT PREVIOUS.

01:38:26.066 --> 01:38:27.067
CAN BE USED TO SUPPORT ALL OF

01:38:27.134 --> 01:38:28.369
THE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES THAT

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:30.137
ARE OUTLINED IN THESE TWO MOST

01:38:30.204 --> 01:38:31.705
RECENT PROPOSALS. INCLUDING

01:38:31.772 --> 01:38:33.340
TARGETED INVENTION INTERVENTION

01:38:33.407 --> 01:38:34.708
IS LIKE KIND OF TUTORING AND

01:38:34.775 --> 01:38:37.544
ACTIVITIES- TO OPEN SCHOOLS.

01:38:37.611 --> 01:38:39.246
AND WE ARE CONCERNED IS THAT

01:38:39.313 --> 01:38:41.115
THESE TWO PROPOSALS PROVIDE A

01:38:41.181 --> 01:38:41.982
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

01:38:42.049 --> 01:38:44.118
FUNDING. I WITHOUT IT THEIR

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.719
JUSTIFICATION FOR IT. A LEADING

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:46.920
UP TO THE MAY REVISION WHAT WE

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.589
HEARD FROM DISTRICTS THAT THAT

01:38:48.656 --> 01:38:50.224
DISTRICTS HAVE NOT SPENT ALL OF

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.458
THE ONE TIME FUNDED THEY'VE

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.059
ALREADY RECEIVED CITIES

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:54.328
ACTIVITIES. AND ALTHOUGH THEY

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:56.196
FACE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:57.831
THE OPENING SCHOOLS MAKING UP

01:38:57.898 --> 01:38:59.566
PREVENTING LOSS. THOSE DON'T

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:01.035
SEEM TO STEM FROM A LACK OF ONE

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:02.636
TIME FUNDING. IN FACT THE

01:39:02.703 --> 01:39:03.937
BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK FOR

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:04.872
MANY DISTRICTS IS FINDING

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:06.040
EFFECTIVE WAYS TO USE THE

01:39:06.106 --> 01:39:07.841
FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY RECEIVED.

01:39:07.908 --> 01:39:09.376
SO WE THINK YOU COULD REJECT

01:39:09.443 --> 01:39:11.145
BOTH OF THOSE PROPOSALS. AND

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:15.749
USE THOSE. FREED UP FUNDS FOR

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:16.550
HIGHER PRIORITIES. LASTLY WE

01:39:16.617 --> 01:39:18.118
THERE IS A MISTER. IN THIS

01:39:18.185 --> 01:39:19.687
MAYOR TO MAKE MORE PROGRESS ON

01:39:19.753 --> 01:39:21.021
BUILDING SCHOOL DISTRICT-

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:23.490
BUDGET RESILIENCY- SPECIFICALLY

01:39:23.557 --> 01:39:24.625
LEAVING TWO POINT SIX BILLION

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:27.194
AND APPROACH THE MEANING- THAT

01:39:27.261 --> 01:39:29.163
SECOND STEP THE CONCERN TO US-

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:30.497
IT'S A CONTRAST TO WHAT THE

01:39:30.564 --> 01:39:31.732
ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THE

01:39:31.799 --> 01:39:33.767
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIDE. ALL OF

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:35.169
THOSE DEFERRALS ARE PAID DOWN

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.670
WE THINK THAT'S MORE PROMISING

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:37.571
APPROACH AND WE RECOMMEND

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.773
ADOPTING. THAT SAME APPROACH

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:43.444
FOR. K. TWELVE EDUCATION- THE

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:45.879
BUDGET ALSO HAVE- ANY PROPOSALS

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:47.047
RELATED TO LONG TERM INCREASES

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:50.551
AND PENSION COSTS. AND IN

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:51.985
PREVIOUS YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN

01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:53.687
SOME PROPOSALS AND WE'VE SEEN-

01:39:53.754 --> 01:39:56.490
BASED ON THAT ARE MAKING OUT OF

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:57.858
LARGE ONE TIME PAYMENT IN ONE

01:39:57.925 --> 01:40:00.394
YEAR CAN PROVIDE SAVINGS OVER A

01:40:00.461 --> 01:40:01.729
NUMBER OF DECADES AND REALLY

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:02.930
HELP ADDRESS AND STABILIZE

01:40:02.996 --> 01:40:05.032
DISTRICT BUDGETS OVER A LONGER

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:08.102
PERIOD OF TIME. AND I THINK. I

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:09.970
JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT ONE

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:11.205
REASON WE BRING UP THIS THE

01:40:11.271 --> 01:40:12.973
SCHOOL DISTRICT BUDGET-

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.875
RESILIENCY CONCERN ISN'T JUST

01:40:14.942 --> 01:40:17.511
ABOUT- IS BEING A GOOD FISCAL

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.046
PRACTICE ALTHOUGH WE THINK THAT

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:20.881
CLEARLY IS A CONCERN AND I

01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:23.484
COULD. JUST CONSIDERATION. BUT

01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:24.685
ALSO WE THINK THAT THE BENEFITS

01:40:24.752 --> 01:40:26.286
STUDENTS BY INCREASING THE

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:28.522
LIKELIHOOD. THAT THE PROGRAMS

01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:29.857
DISTRICTS CREATE OVER THE

01:40:29.923 --> 01:40:31.024
COMING YEAR WITH ALL OF THIS

01:40:31.091 --> 01:40:33.193
ONE TIME FUNDING THE RECEIVING.

01:40:33.260 --> 01:40:34.027
THAT THOSE PROGRAMS CAN BE

01:40:34.094 --> 01:40:36.697
SUSTAINED. OVER TIME OVER A

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:38.832
LONGER PERIOD AND THROUGHOUT AN

01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.209
YEAR. SO THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS

01:55:16.276 --> 01:55:18.544
WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL AND

01:55:18.611 --> 01:55:20.179

I THINK THAT THAT POLICY

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:51.611
CONCERN HERE IS THAT WE WANT TO

01:55:51.678 --> 01:55:52.578

ADMINISTERING SO THE DEPARTMENT

BECAUSE MAYBE. THEY DON'T NEED

01:57:38.584 --> 01:57:39.585

AND AN INDEPENDENT STUDY THEY

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:15.848
DON'T SERVE- THE ACADEMIC NEEDS

01:59:15.915 --> 01:59:17.183

CLEAN THAT UP I KNOW THERE'S

01:59:18.684 --> 01:59:19.185
SOME LANGUAGE I BELIEVE IS

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:21.087
COMING OUT TODAY. I HAVEN'T

01:59:21.153 --> 01:59:22.421

AREAS OF CREDENTIALING. DOES

01:59:35.101 --> 01:59:37.036
THE ADMINISTRATION AGREE THAT

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:37.537

THE ACADEMIC SIDE AND THE

02:00:13.139 --> 02:00:14.273
FISCAL SIDE. SO COULD THE

02:00:14.340 --> 02:00:15.508
ADMINISTRATION. SPEAK TO THE

02:00:15.575 --> 02:00:19.011

FULL TIME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:29.849
PROGRAM IN THE FALL. SO THE

02:01:29.915 --> 02:01:31.517
INDEPENDENT STUDY PIECE THAT IS

02:01:31.584 --> 02:01:33.052
THE OPTIONAL I'M PROGRAM THE

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.520
LEDS CAN PROVIDE IN THAT

02:01:34.587 --> 02:01:37.089
PARENTS CAN OPT INTO. IS BUILT

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:38.491
ON THE EXISTING INDEPENDENT

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:39.892
STUDY PROGRAM WE HAD SOME

02:01:39.959 --> 02:01:42.061
STRONG CONCERNS ABOUT- THE

02:01:42.128 --> 02:01:43.396
QUALITY OF SOME OF THE

02:01:43.462 --> 02:01:44.430
INDEPENDENT THREE PROGRAMS THAT

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:46.132
WERE BEING. CONDUCTED A

02:01:46.198 --> 02:01:47.667
MINISTER PRIOR TO COMMITTING

02:01:47.733 --> 02:01:50.169
DURING COVE IT- IN A LOT OF

02:01:50.236 --> 02:01:51.103
THEM HAVE TO DO I THINK WITH A

02:01:51.170 --> 02:01:52.905
SIMILAR CONCERN. THAT YOU ALL

02:01:52.972 --> 02:01:55.408
HAVE AROUND YOU KNOW THE IDEA

02:01:55.474 --> 02:01:57.343
THAT UNDER THE OLD LAWS YOU

02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.978
KNOW AT AT. AN EARLY AGE COULD

02:01:59.045 --> 02:02:00.346
SEND A PACKET HOME WITH THE

02:02:00.413 --> 02:02:02.615
STUDENTS AND- YOU KNOW THE

02:02:02.682 --> 02:02:03.983
STUDENTS ACTUALLY IS TEACHING

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.284
THEMSELVES AND THEN COMING BACK

02:02:05.351 --> 02:02:06.352
AND SWITCHING OUT PACKETS TWO

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:11.257
WEEKS LATER YOUTHAT THAT. IS

02:02:11.323 --> 02:02:11.757
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE NOT

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:12.458
SUPPORT OF A- SO ARE PER. AND

02:02:12.525 --> 02:02:15.227
IS. ON IT OF- IMPROVEMENTS TO

02:02:15.294 --> 02:02:17.697
THE EXISTING PROGRAM. THE FIRST

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:21.734
EING THAT- FOR ANY STUDENT

02:02:21.801 --> 02:02:23.135
THAT IS PARTICIPATING OPTING

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:23.969
INTO AN INDEPENDENT STUDY

02:02:24.036 --> 02:02:26.038
PROGRAM LOCAL EDUCATIONAL

02:02:26.105 --> 02:02:27.139
AGENCY WILL BE REQUIRED TO

02:02:27.206 --> 02:02:28.507
PROVIDE THEM WITH THE DEVICE

02:02:28.574 --> 02:02:30.176
THAT TECH THAT TECHNOLOGY

02:02:30.242 --> 02:02:30.643
ESSENTIALLY DEVICE AND

02:02:30.710 --> 02:02:33.379
CONNECTIVITY. ON TO PARTICIPATE

02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:35.281
IN ONLINE INSTRUCTION- ANOTHER

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:37.283
KEY PIECE IN TERMS OF THE

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:39.351
STUDENT TEACHER ENGAGEMENT IS

02:02:39.418 --> 02:02:41.387
THAT THE- TEACHER WILL BE

02:02:41.454 --> 02:02:43.289
REQUIRED TO DO A DAILY CHECK

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:45.257
INS WITH A STUDENT TODAY TO

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:46.492
CHECK IN WITH THEM MAKE SURE

02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:48.060
THEY'RE OKAY SEE IF THEY HAVE

02:02:48.127 --> 02:02:50.096
ANY NEEDS OR CONCERNS. AND THEN

02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.697
AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK

02:02:51.764 --> 02:02:53.632
PROVIDES SYNCHRONOUS

02:02:53.699 --> 02:02:55.501
INSTRUCTION WITH THAT STUDENT

02:02:55.568 --> 02:02:58.404
SO THE IDEA OF BEING HERE THAT

02:02:58.471 --> 02:03:00.506
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK THAT THAT

02:03:00.573 --> 02:03:01.707
THE TEACHER HAS TO PROVIDE A

02:03:01.774 --> 02:03:02.608
LESSON TO THE INDEPENDENT STUDY

02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:06.278
STUDENTS. ON THE LISTING CHRIS

02:03:06.345 --> 02:03:07.213
MANNER- IN ADDITION WE HAVE

02:03:07.279 --> 02:03:10.516
SOME. AROUND RE ENGAGEMENT

02:03:10.583 --> 02:03:12.218
STRATEGIES FOR THIS IS SIMILAR

02:03:12.284 --> 02:03:14.086
TO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION THE

02:03:14.153 --> 02:03:16.155
LEGISLATURE AGREED TO- WE PUT

02:03:16.222 --> 02:03:18.758
TOGETHER SB NINETY EIGHT IN SB

02:03:18.824 --> 02:03:19.892
TWENTY AROUND TO AGREEING GAUGE

02:03:19.959 --> 02:03:21.527
AND STRATEGIES. ON BEING PUT IN

02:03:21.594 --> 02:03:23.562
PLACE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT

02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:25.698
ENGAGED ON FOR THREE DAYS AT

02:03:25.765 --> 02:03:30.002
LEAST THREE DAYS- OR 60% OF

02:03:30.069 --> 02:03:31.537
INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. HERE STILL

02:03:31.604 --> 02:03:32.505
ENSURING THAT THOSE KIDS WHO

02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:35.341
ARE NOT BEING SERVED WELL AND

02:03:35.407 --> 02:03:36.876
IN THE AN INDEPENDENT STUDY

02:03:36.942 --> 02:03:38.778
PROGRAM HAVE- SOMEONE REACHING

02:03:38.844 --> 02:03:41.580
OUT TO THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEY

02:03:41.647 --> 02:03:42.782
CAN RE ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS.

02:03:42.848 --> 02:03:44.450
SO THAT'S SORT OF A HIGH LEVEL

02:03:44.517 --> 02:03:46.152
OVERVIEW OF THE CHANGES THAT WE

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.721
ARE PROPOSING- HAPPY TO ANSWER

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:50.456

THANK THANK YOU FOR SHARING

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:53.659
THAT AND AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT

02:03:53.726 --> 02:03:54.994
WAS MUCH QUITE FRANKLY THE

02:03:55.060 --> 02:03:55.795
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSING IN

02:03:55.861 --> 02:03:57.296
THIS TIME. TO REALLY BOLSTER

02:03:57.363 --> 02:03:58.898
THAT PROGRAM ENSURE

02:03:58.964 --> 02:04:00.533
ACCOUNTABILITY THERE NEEDS TO

02:04:00.599 --> 02:04:03.102
BE GREATER AUDITING. I WOULD IN

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.403
A PERFECT WORLD I GRADUATE THE

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:05.938
FUNDING OF A STUDENTS AT SCHOOL

02:04:06.005 --> 02:04:08.073
IS NOT IN A SCHOOL SETTING. THE

02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:10.543
SCHOOL- THAT THE ALLEGATION NOT

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:11.544
GET FULL FUNDING FOR THAT

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:13.379
STUDENT- UNIVERSITY YOU KNOW

STEVE YOU'RE NOT NEVER THERE

02:04:14.914 --> 02:04:16.382
ARE ONLY ONLINE WHITE WHITE WHY

02:04:16.448 --> 02:04:17.716
WE SHOULD THEY RECEIVE FULL

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:19.552
EIGHTY AGE MAYBE MAYBE SEVENTY

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.086
PERCENT. IS THAT OF BRICKS AND

02:04:21.153 --> 02:04:22.354
MORTAR AND ALL THE COSTS

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:23.823
ASSOCIATED WITH BRICKS AND

02:04:23.889 --> 02:04:24.657
MORTAR SHOULD BE A GRADUATED

02:04:24.723 --> 02:04:27.660
FUNDING- A STREAM. AND AGAIN%

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:28.994
THE AUDITS ARE KEY AND

02:04:29.061 --> 02:04:30.229
BOLSTERING THE ACADEMIC SIDE I

02:04:30.296 --> 02:04:31.230
REALLY DON'T THINK WE'RE THERE

02:04:31.297 --> 02:04:33.632
YET- YEAH I THINK IT IT'S GOING

02:04:33.699 --> 02:04:34.733
TO BE PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE

02:04:34.800 --> 02:04:35.601
ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE

02:04:35.668 --> 02:04:41.240
CHILDREN- IT YET ENGAGING AN

02:04:41.307 --> 02:04:41.907
INDEPENDENT STUDY- NEXT YEAR

02:04:41.974 --> 02:04:42.775
BUT THAT'S- THE TOP. AT THE

02:04:42.842 --> 02:04:43.776
PART OF THE ONE OF THE TOP OF

02:04:43.843 --> 02:04:44.777
THE HEARING THIS HEARING BUT

02:04:44.844 --> 02:04:46.712
NOT THE ONLY TOPIC. BUT AGAIN-

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:49.215
WITH REGARD TO- IT INDEPENDENT

02:04:49.281 --> 02:04:51.116
STUDY NOW WE HAVE AS COMPANIES

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.818
COMING INTO SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:54.186
IN OFFERING TO HANDLE THEIR

02:04:54.253 --> 02:04:56.722
ONLINE LEARNING FOR THEM. AND

02:04:56.789 --> 02:04:59.391
THAT- PRESENTS A COUPLE

02:04:59.458 --> 02:05:01.994
QUESTIONS AB FIVE ALONE. AB

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:04.530
FIVE VIOLATIONS. SO I HOPE THE

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:05.464
ADMINISTRATION IS WILLING TO

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:08.834
ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS. TO

02:05:08.901 --> 02:05:10.836
ENSURE THAT- I INDEPENDENT

02:05:10.903 --> 02:05:16.642
STUDY IS. IS BOLSTERED AND

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:20.212
APPROPRIATE AND LEGAL- SO WHAT

02:05:20.279 --> 02:05:21.547
WE'LL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS

02:05:21.614 --> 02:05:24.283
GOING FORWARD- SO LET ME SWITCH

02:05:24.350 --> 02:05:26.118
TO A DIFFERENT QUESTION HERE US

02:05:26.185 --> 02:05:26.819
PROBABLY AGAIN FOR THE

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.254
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH

02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:29.655
REGARD TO THE RE BENCHING A

02:05:29.722 --> 02:05:32.024
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:33.092
THERE IS THERE TRAILER BILL

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:34.827
LANGUAGE YET ON THE RE BENCHING

02:05:34.894 --> 02:05:36.428

WITH THE GUARANTEE BE THAT IT

02:05:39.765 --> 02:05:41.600
ACTUALLY IS A REINVENTION AND

02:05:41.667 --> 02:05:42.935
THAT THOSE THAT DID REMAINS

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.603
FUNDED IN THE OUT YEARS

02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:45.204
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE GOING TO

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:46.972
ADD A GRADE LEVEL THE PEOPLE

02:05:47.039 --> 02:05:48.440
LEADER STANDIFER ADDING T. K.

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:49.241

TO AN EXISTING BUCKET OF

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:55.014
DOLLARS WE WANT TO GROW THAT.

02:05:55.080 --> 02:05:56.649
BUCKET OF DOLLARS AS WE GROW

I THINK YOU DESCRIBED IT QUITE

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:16.201
TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT.

02:06:16.268 --> 02:06:17.970
THE INTENT WITH EVERY BATCH IT

02:06:18.037 --> 02:06:19.305
TO BE ABLE TO GROW THE POT OF

02:06:19.371 --> 02:06:20.773
FUNDING IN THE CASE UNDER OUT

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.041
THE ATTACK WITH THE FEET WITH

02:06:22.107 --> 02:06:24.109
THIS INCREASE OF ADA. AND NOT

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:26.645
JUST CROWD OUT FUNDING. FOR

02:06:26.712 --> 02:06:27.780
OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE OF

02:06:27.846 --> 02:06:28.948
INCREASED ABOUT THE ABOUT WITH

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:31.250
HIM. PROBABLY NINETY EIGHT- IF

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.484
WE IF WE DIDN'T TAKE THAT

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.219
APPROACH SO. AT THE MOMENT.

02:06:34.286 --> 02:06:37.623
BECAUSE BE ADDITIONAL ADA NOT

02:06:37.690 --> 02:06:40.726
THAT TO. BE ROLE THEN UNTIL

02:06:40.793 --> 02:06:42.194
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. LPF

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:43.429
PERCEIVED THE CONTINUOUS OF

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:45.397
CORPORATION. OF THE APPROACH AT

02:06:45.464 --> 02:06:46.865
THE MOMENT IS THAT WE WOULD.

02:06:46.932 --> 02:06:48.701
OVER APPROPRIATE- THE

02:06:48.767 --> 02:06:50.669
GUARANTEED MOST LIKELY BY

02:06:50.736 --> 02:06:52.738
WHATEVER. AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL

02:06:52.805 --> 02:06:55.174
FUNDING WE ESTIMATE. WILL BE

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.009
INTRODUCED ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

02:06:57.076 --> 02:06:58.844
INCREASE THEN CAN. TRANSITIONAL

IS ACHIEVED AFTER THE NEXT

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:09.188
THREE YEARS FROM THERE- WE

02:07:09.254 --> 02:07:11.056
WOULD LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT

02:07:11.123 --> 02:07:12.291
WOULD MAKE THE MOST SENSE

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:13.325
WHETHER IT'S AN ONGOING TEST

02:07:13.392 --> 02:07:15.160
ONE PERCENTAGE REBOUNDS OR OR

02:07:15.227 --> 02:07:16.228
SOME OTHER MECHANISM ASSUMING

02:07:16.295 --> 02:07:18.097
WE- WOULD STILL BE AN ATTACHED

02:07:18.163 --> 02:07:20.265
ONE AT THAT TIME- WE WOULD LOOK

02:07:20.332 --> 02:07:22.001
AT THAT. DOWN BUT CURRENTLY

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:24.670
UNDER THE- TRAILER BILL AS-

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:26.271
DRAFTED THE MOMENT THERE IS NOT

JUST A BIG LANGUAGE TO THAT

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:37.149
EFFECT. RIGHT- THANK YOU I.

02:07:37.216 --> 02:07:37.750
WITH REGARD TO THE EXTENT OF

02:07:37.816 --> 02:07:38.851
THE HOW THOSE- DAHLE DIFFERENT

02:07:38.917 --> 02:07:41.053
THAN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION.

COMMUNITY ADMINISTRATION- AND I

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:40.178
THINK IN ORDER TO DO THAT

02:13:40.245 --> 02:13:41.646
THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT

02:13:41.713 --> 02:13:42.481
THAT THAT SHOULD BE REMEDIED

02:13:42.547 --> 02:13:45.517

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:46.418
I BROUGHT TO THE COMMITTEE

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:47.819

REMEDY THAT- SPECIAL EDUCATION

02:14:13.545 --> 02:14:15.080
YESTERDAY IN A CALL INCREASE

THAT WOULD BE ALLOWABLE USE FOR

02:26:20.938 --> 02:26:22.807
THESE FUNDS AS WELL SO THEY'RE

02:26:22.874 --> 02:26:23.808
INTENDED TO BUILD UPON THE

02:26:23.875 --> 02:26:24.942
FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY

02:26:25.009 --> 02:26:26.611

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:34.986
PROVIDED TO A BROADER. SWATH.

02:26:35.052 --> 02:26:37.889
OF ALLEYS ACROSS THE STATE. DO

YOU HAVE FROM REGARD THE TO

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:39.657
MORE THAT WAS A PER. BUT THEY

02:26:39.724 --> 02:26:42.026
BE AT LEAST DO YOU- KNOW HOW.

02:26:42.093 --> 02:26:45.997
OF A HAS BEEN. AND ON WHAT. SO

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:47.632
THOSE FUNDS COULD BE USED TO

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:50.668
COVER COSTS THE LEDS INCURRED-

02:26:50.735 --> 02:26:52.069
PRIOR TO THIS WE CAN AS LONG AS

02:26:52.136 --> 02:26:53.104
HOLDEN I'M NOT ASKING WHAT THE

02:26:53.171 --> 02:26:55.006
ALLOWABLE USES FOR NOT NOT FOR

02:26:55.072 --> 02:26:56.140
THE TWO BILLION IN YOUR MAYBE

02:26:56.207 --> 02:26:57.108
VICE PULLS OF THE TWO BILLION

02:26:57.175 --> 02:26:59.177
THAT WE ALREADY APPROPRIATED

02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:00.244
THREE B. EIGHTY SIX. YOU KNOW

02:27:00.311 --> 02:27:03.281
HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS BEEN.

02:27:03.347 --> 02:27:04.949
SPENT AND ON WHAT. SO THE FIRST

02:27:05.016 --> 02:27:07.485
ALLOCATION OF THOSE FUNDS WAS-

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.053
I BELIEVE IT HAS JUST BEEN MADE

02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:10.254
THE FIRST ALLOCATION WITH

02:27:10.321 --> 02:27:12.223
INTENDED TO GO OUT IN MAY. OF

02:27:12.290 --> 02:27:13.257
THIS YEAR AND THE WITH THE

02:27:13.324 --> 02:27:15.326
FOLLOW UP TO GO OUT IN AUGUST

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:16.294
BECAUSE THAT WAS DEPENDENT UPON

02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:17.995
SCHOOLS RE OPENING FOR IN

02:27:18.062 --> 02:27:19.897
PERSON INSTRUCTION. SO WE DON'T

02:27:19.964 --> 02:27:21.232
HAVE DATA YET ON WHAT THOSE

02:27:21.299 --> 02:27:23.401
EXPENDITURES WERE. HOWEVER WE

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.603
DID PROVIDE ELEAZAR WITH THEIR-

02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:28.005
TOTAL GRANT AWARD AMOUNT. AND

02:27:28.072 --> 02:27:29.207
DID TELL THEM THAT THEY COULD

02:27:29.273 --> 02:27:31.509
USE THOSE FUNDS. TO REIMBURSE

02:27:31.576 --> 02:27:32.877
THEMSELVES FOR COSTS INCURRED

02:27:32.944 --> 02:27:34.178
PRIOR TO THE RECEIPT OF THOSE

02:27:34.245 --> 02:27:37.215
PLANS. SO WE WILL KNOW- AFTER

02:27:37.281 --> 02:27:38.649
THAT THOSE FUNDS WILL GO OUT

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:40.051
HOW THEY WERE EXPENDED BUT IT

02:27:40.117 --> 02:27:40.618
MAY BE THAT THEY'RE ALREADY

02:27:40.685 --> 02:27:45.289
IDENTIFIED- INTACT. FOR

02:27:45.356 --> 02:27:45.890
EXPENDITURES THAT HAVE ALREADY

02:27:45.957 --> 02:27:48.192
HAPPENED. GOT IT WILL ALSO.

02:27:48.259 --> 02:27:49.694
HOME WHAT WHAT WE DIDN'T

02:27:49.760 --> 02:27:51.262
DISCUSS WITH THE FIVE BILLION

02:27:51.329 --> 02:27:52.797
THAT WAS ALREADY APPROPRIATED

02:27:52.863 --> 02:27:54.632
PREVIOUSLY. IN THIS YEAR'S

02:27:54.699 --> 02:27:56.968
BUDGET. THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

02:27:57.034 --> 02:27:59.136
USED FOR RE OPENING- THE

02:27:59.203 --> 02:28:00.071
MAJORITY OF IT WAS USED FOR

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:01.639
DISTANCE LEARNING SO THAT.

02:28:01.706 --> 02:28:03.274
ELLIE IS HAD THAT CHOICE FOR

02:28:03.341 --> 02:28:05.610
THE FIVE BILLION. TO SPEND IT

02:28:05.676 --> 02:28:07.378
AND I WAS THE LEGISLATURE THAT

02:28:07.445 --> 02:28:08.980
WITHOUR INSTRUCTION THE

02:28:09.046 --> 02:28:09.447
GOVERNOR'S DESTRUCTION

02:28:09.513 --> 02:28:10.748
LEGISLATURE DESTRUCTION TO.

02:28:10.815 --> 02:28:13.451
SPEND IT ON- THE OPENING TO THE

02:28:13.517 --> 02:28:15.152
GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT-

02:28:15.219 --> 02:28:16.854
SOMETHING THAT THEY DIDN'T DO

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:20.391
VERY WELL SO I GUESS- FOR ME I

02:28:20.458 --> 02:28:21.325
WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE

02:28:21.392 --> 02:28:22.493
FROM PALM BEACH OF THE TWO

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.628
BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING OUT

02:28:23.694 --> 02:28:26.364
AND MAY. END IN AUGUST AND WE

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:28.866
DON'T EVEN KNOW. IF THEY HAVE

02:28:28.933 --> 02:28:30.468
SPENT IT OR EVEN NEEDED IT

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:34.238
SEEMS- PREMATURE. TO DO ANOTHER

02:28:34.305 --> 02:28:36.173
TWO BILLION ON TOP OF THAT.

02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:37.975
WHEN IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THAT

02:28:38.042 --> 02:28:38.576
THEY EVEN NEED THE TWO BILLION

02:28:38.643 --> 02:28:41.145
ESPECIALLY. WILL BE GIVEN THE

02:28:41.212 --> 02:28:42.580
FIVE BILLION FOR RE OPENING

02:28:42.647 --> 02:28:43.414
WHICH WE HAD HOPED WOULD BE

02:28:43.481 --> 02:28:45.516
USED FOR MASS AND PLEXIGLASS

02:28:45.583 --> 02:28:47.685
AND SPACING- ONLY 10% OF IT WAS

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.253
USED FOR THOSE TYPES OF ITEMS

02:28:49.320 --> 02:28:53.557
AND SO I THINK. THAT- TO ME THE

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:54.792
TWO BILLION COULD BETTER BETTER

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:58.162
USED ELSEWHERE. I WANTED TO GO

02:28:58.229 --> 02:29:02.767
INTO. ON JUST JUST OF WHAT WHAT

02:29:02.833 --> 02:29:03.901
ALSO JUST GOING TO INDEPENDENT

02:29:03.968 --> 02:29:05.603
STUDY AS WELL I THINK IT'S

02:29:05.670 --> 02:29:06.671
IMPORTANT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE

02:29:06.737 --> 02:29:09.307
QUESTION IS THERE A REASON WHY

02:29:09.373 --> 02:29:12.977
WE DON'T WANT THE GUY- THE

02:29:13.044 --> 02:29:13.711
ADMINISTRATION DID NOT PROPOSE

02:29:13.778 --> 02:29:17.615
A CAP ON. THE NUMBER OF

02:29:17.682 --> 02:29:18.149
STUDENTS USING INDEPENDENT

02:29:18.215 --> 02:29:22.653
STUDY. YES SO- WE DIDN'T

02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:24.322
PROPOSED A CAP UNDERSTANDING

02:29:24.388 --> 02:29:25.890
THAT IN SYDNEY TO THE EXTENT

02:29:25.956 --> 02:29:27.725
THE PARENTS FROM WOULD LIKE THE

02:29:27.792 --> 02:29:29.894
CHOICE TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN

02:29:29.960 --> 02:29:30.761
BE IN DISTANCE LEARNING AGAIN

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:32.263
NEXT YEAR. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:34.265
THE OPTION NOT BE LIMITED AND

02:29:34.332 --> 02:29:38.302
BYE BYE A NUMBER AN ARBITRARY

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:39.537
PERSON AT THE STATELEVEL. SO

02:29:39.603 --> 02:29:42.106
IF A SCHOOL WANTED TO ENROLL

02:29:42.173 --> 02:29:43.674
90% OF ITS STUDENTS AND

02:29:43.741 --> 02:29:44.275
INDEPENDENT SAY THAT WOULD BE

02:29:44.342 --> 02:29:48.913
OKAY. W. ALLOWABLE I'M EIGHT I

02:29:48.979 --> 02:29:51.515
WANNA- JUST. MAKE SURE I'M

02:29:51.582 --> 02:29:52.550
UNDERSTANDING YOUR QUESTION

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:54.719
CLEARLY SO- THERE'S A

02:29:54.785 --> 02:29:56.487
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A PARENT

02:29:56.554 --> 02:30:00.891
CHOICE AND A SCHOOL I HAVE. A

02:30:00.958 --> 02:30:02.560
REFER THAT QUESTION SO IF 90%

02:30:02.626 --> 02:30:03.994
OF PARENTS IN A PARTICULAR

02:30:04.061 --> 02:30:05.896
SCHOOL WANTED TO ENROLL IN

02:30:05.963 --> 02:30:06.797
DISTANCE LEARNING THEIR WOULD

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:08.132
BE ALLOWED TO AN END

02:30:08.199 --> 02:30:09.900
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THAT'S

02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:13.104
CORRECT AND BACK END THE

02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:15.740
ADMINISTRATION BE OKAY WITHOUT.

02:30:15.806 --> 02:30:17.408
YES WE ARE SUPPORTIVE PARENT

02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:20.544
CHOICE AND IN TERMS OF THE

02:30:20.611 --> 02:30:21.112
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL

02:30:21.178 --> 02:30:22.279
YEAR AND WHETHER OR NOT PARENTS

02:30:22.346 --> 02:30:23.381
FEEL COMFORTABLE BRINGING THEIR

02:30:23.447 --> 02:30:24.415
KIDS BACK TO IN PERSON

02:30:24.482 --> 02:30:26.083
INSTRUCTION THIS IS A CELL I AM

02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:27.752
NOW I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I

02:30:27.818 --> 02:30:30.654
THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE ON-

02:30:30.721 --> 02:30:33.691
PRETTY CATASTROPHIC MISTAKE-

02:30:33.758 --> 02:30:36.494
THAT. KNOWING HOW MUCH LEARNING

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:39.096
LOSS WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR-

02:30:39.163 --> 02:30:40.798
KNOWING THAT AT THIS POINT

02:30:40.865 --> 02:30:43.067
THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT. NEEDING

02:30:43.134 --> 02:30:45.636
CREDENTIALED TEACHERS. FOR THIS

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:48.239
INDEPENDENT STUDY- WITHOUT

02:30:48.305 --> 02:30:51.642
FURTHER TIGHTENING THIS I THINK

02:30:51.709 --> 02:30:53.611
IT WOULD BE ON. IT WOULD NOT BE

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:55.813
VERY GOOD POLICY GIVEN WHAT WE

02:30:55.880 --> 02:30:57.915
HAVE WITNESSED AYE I KNOW THAT

02:30:57.982 --> 02:31:00.284
THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE DEBATED

02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:02.153
DISTANCE LEARNING AND I THINK

02:31:02.219 --> 02:31:04.922
GIVEN WHAT WE KNEW LAST YEAR TO

02:31:04.989 --> 02:31:05.589
GET WILL BE NEW LAST YEAR AS WE

02:31:05.656 --> 02:31:07.358
WERE IN. IN A MONTH TO OF THE

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:09.126
PANDEMIC THAT WE ACTUALLY KNOW

02:31:09.193 --> 02:31:13.230
VERY LITTLE ABOUT AND WE HAD

02:31:13.297 --> 02:31:15.966
HOPED THAT GIVING FROM

02:31:16.033 --> 02:31:18.269
DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:31:18.335 --> 02:31:19.437
DISTANCE LEARN BUT ALSO TO

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:21.405
BRING THE CHILDREN BACK WOULD

02:31:21.472 --> 02:31:25.342
WOULD WORK. CLEARLY IT DID NOT

02:31:25.409 --> 02:31:27.578
I DISTRICTS- DEMONSTRATED A

02:31:27.645 --> 02:31:32.450
VERY- INABILITY TO SHUT DOWN

02:31:32.516 --> 02:31:33.150
BUT THEY DID NOT DEMONSTRATE

02:31:33.217 --> 02:31:40.291
ANY ALMOST NO ABILITY. TO OVER

02:31:40.357 --> 02:31:42.359
80% OF CHILDREN REMAIN NOT

02:31:42.426 --> 02:31:44.562
FULLY BACK IN SCHOOL EVEN AT A

02:31:44.628 --> 02:31:47.031
TIME WHEN A COVERT RATES AGAIN

02:31:47.097 --> 02:31:49.200
R. AS LAW WAS WHEN WE SHUT DOWN

02:31:49.266 --> 02:31:52.736
IN MARCH. ALSO IN TERMS OF

02:31:52.803 --> 02:31:53.771
INDEPENDENT STUDY I THINK IT'S

02:31:53.838 --> 02:31:56.407
VERY CONCERNING THAT THERE IS

02:31:56.474 --> 02:31:58.909
NOT DALY AND ASYNCHRONOUS

02:31:58.976 --> 02:31:59.810
LEARNING WITH A CREDENTIAL

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:03.147
TEACHER I THINK THAT- NOT

02:32:03.214 --> 02:32:06.517
HAVING- ANY PARTICULAR LANGUAGE

02:32:06.584 --> 02:32:10.955
ASTO- WHAT WILL HAPPEN-HILL

02:32:11.021 --> 02:32:13.190
CAN THAT PARTICULAR SETTING I

02:32:13.257 --> 02:32:17.528
THINK- WE DON'T DEFINE THAT IN

02:32:17.595 --> 02:32:19.230
GREATER DETAIL I THINK WE WILL

02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:21.198
DEFINITELY. LIVE TO REGRET THIS

02:32:21.265 --> 02:32:22.366
NEXT YEAR HEN WE'RE HAVING

02:32:22.433 --> 02:32:23.868
THIS HEARING GOING INTO NEXT

02:32:23.934 --> 02:32:26.303
YEAR'S ME REVISED. I'M JUST IN

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:27.571
ADDITION I THINK IT IS

02:32:27.638 --> 02:32:32.610
IMPORTANT THAT- WE HAD HOPED-

02:32:32.676 --> 02:32:34.211
THAT DISTRICTS WOULD FOLLOW OUR

02:32:34.278 --> 02:32:36.046
INSTRUCTION TO HAVE IN PERSON

02:32:36.113 --> 02:32:36.981
LEARNING TO THE GREATEST EXTENT

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:39.517
POSSIBLE- ALMOST EVERY DISTRICT

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:42.186
DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO DO

02:32:42.253 --> 02:32:44.788
THAT I THINK- MY OWN. DISTRICT

02:32:44.855 --> 02:32:46.924
HAS BECOME THE POSTER CHILD OF

02:32:46.991 --> 02:32:49.793
HOW NOT TO DO THIS. ON AND I

02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:50.928
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:32:50.995 --> 02:32:54.031
HAVE A TRIGGER ON HOW TO RE

02:32:54.098 --> 02:32:56.901
OPEN IF IN FACT WE DO HAVE SOME

02:32:56.967 --> 02:32:58.002
DISTRICTS THAT HAVE AN

02:32:58.068 --> 02:33:00.004
OUTBREAK. OF BECAUSE IT SEEMS

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:01.472
THAT IF THERE IS AN OUTBREAK

02:33:01.539 --> 02:33:03.674
DISTRICTS WILL PROBABLY THE BE

02:33:03.741 --> 02:33:04.775
ALLOWED TO SHUT DOWN A WILL

02:33:04.842 --> 02:33:06.644
NEED TO SHUT DOWN. BUT I THINK

02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:09.780
WE NEED TO. FIGURE OUT WHAT

02:33:09.847 --> 02:33:11.815
TYPE O TRIGGER WILL BRING THEM

02:33:11.882 --> 02:33:14.485
BACK HI I FEAR THAT ONCE

02:33:14.552 --> 02:33:16.120
DISTRICTS ARE SHUT DOWN BECAUSE

02:33:16.186 --> 02:33:17.154
OF AN OUTBREAK THAT THEY WILL

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:19.256
NOT COME BACK AND I THINK THAT

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:21.559
IS A VERY. SIGNIFICANT

02:33:21.625 --> 02:33:23.127
CONCERNS- JUST I WOULD JUST

02:35:34.591 --> 02:35:36.226
CRITICAL IS I REALLY APPRECIATE

02:35:36.293 --> 02:35:37.227
THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS FOR

THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT

02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:41.098
FAMILIES NOT GOING BACK I THINK

02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:42.633
A NUMBER OF FAMILIES. ARE GOING

02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:43.367

WORKING FAMILY YOU CAN'T PICK

02:35:49.106 --> 02:35:50.808
UP YOUR CHILD AT ONE THIRTY

02:35:50.874 --> 02:35:52.609
UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTENDED FAMILY

02:35:52.676 --> 02:35:56.413

SO WE GO BACK TO THAT MODEL. IS

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:07.357
ACTUALLY CRITICAL I REALLY

02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:09.693
APPRECIATE THAT INVESTMENT IN

WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS HOMES ARE

02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:22.306
I WORRY THAT INDEPENDENT STUDY

02:36:22.372 --> 02:36:24.308
WILL BE ABUSED THE WAY DISTANCE

02:36:24.374 --> 02:36:26.577
LEARNING HAS BEEN ABUSED. AND

02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:29.646
IF WE DON'T CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE

02:36:29.713 --> 02:36:32.483
WE WILL REGRET. SELL I

02:36:32.549 --> 02:36:36.787

02:36:44.061 --> 02:36:46.730
SAYING. BUT THAT THE LETTER OF

02:36:46.797 --> 02:36:49.066
THE LAW REFLECTS BUT THE

02:36:49.133 --> 02:36:51.301
GOVERNOR HE SAID. AND IF WE

02:36:51.368 --> 02:36:54.772
REALLY WANT CHILDREN TO BE BACK

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:58.542
IN SCHOOL. IN THE FALL THAT

02:36:58.609 --> 02:37:00.310
INDEPENDENT STUDY LOOPHOLE

02:37:00.377 --> 02:37:02.646
HOUSE TO BE CLOSED. IT HAS TO

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:04.481
BE CLOSED IN A WAY TO MAKE A

02:37:04.548 --> 02:37:06.650
LEGITIMATE HAS TO BE CLOSED IN

02:37:06.717 --> 02:37:08.886
A WAY THAT WE ARE FULLY

02:37:08.952 --> 02:37:11.688
CONFIDENT THAT EVERY STUDENT

02:37:11.755 --> 02:37:12.656
WHO IS PURSUING THAT PATH IS

02:37:12.723 --> 02:37:14.424
GOING TO GET AS GOOD AN

02:37:14.491 --> 02:37:16.794
EDUCATION AS THOSE WHO ARE IN

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.762
THE CLASSROOM. SO I THINK THAT

02:37:18.829 --> 02:37:21.431
IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE STRIVING

02:37:21.498 --> 02:37:22.866
FOR AND I THINK THAT- WE VERY

02:37:22.933 --> 02:37:25.035
MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING

02:37:25.102 --> 02:37:27.004
DISCUSSIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:37:27.070 --> 02:37:30.007
ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE- NOT JUST A

02:37:30.073 --> 02:37:33.777
GOAL IN SPIRIT. BUT THEIR GOAL

02:37:33.844 --> 02:37:37.447
IN LIFE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK

02:37:37.514 --> 02:37:42.519

TWO QUICK ONE QUICK COMMENTS

02:37:44.221 --> 02:37:46.056
AND THEN- ONE POINT OF

02:37:46.123 --> 02:37:48.926
CLARIFICATION- I WOULD AGREE

02:37:48.992 --> 02:37:50.527
WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THE TWO

02:37:50.594 --> 02:37:51.995
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WHAT I'M

02:37:52.062 --> 02:37:53.163
HEARING FROM MY SCHOOL

02:37:53.230 --> 02:37:54.364
DISTRICTS AS THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:37:54.431 --> 02:37:57.668
MONEY AND- THEY HAD ONE OF MY

02:37:57.734 --> 02:37:59.169
SUPERINTENDENCIA WE ACTUALLY

02:37:59.236 --> 02:38:00.637
DON'T NEED MORE MONEY I'M BUT

02:38:00.704 --> 02:38:02.706
WHAT THEY NEED IS FLEXIBILITY

02:38:02.773 --> 02:38:03.907
IN ORDER TO SPEND AND MOVE

02:38:03.974 --> 02:38:05.242
AROUND CURRENT DOLLARS THAT

02:38:05.309 --> 02:38:07.211
THEY DO HAVE SO I THINK WE

02:38:07.277 --> 02:38:09.079
SHOULD REALLY BE CONSIDERING.

02:38:09.146 --> 02:38:11.315
AN OLD EIGHT GIVING THEM NOT

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.817
FLEXIBILITY AND IS IT AN AND

02:38:13.884 --> 02:38:15.686
JULIE IF WE'RE GOING TO GIVE

02:38:15.752 --> 02:38:16.887

02:38:16.954 --> 02:38:18.789
DOLLARS MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:38:18.856 --> 02:38:20.824
MONEY CAN BE SPENT FLEXIBILITY

02:38:20.891 --> 02:38:22.559
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE

02:38:22.626 --> 02:38:23.927
P. TO DISTRICT IS DIFFERENT

02:38:23.994 --> 02:38:25.128
EACH COMMUNITY HAS ITS OWN

02:38:25.195 --> 02:38:26.763
NEEDS THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:27.798
ALLOW THEM TO DETERMINE WHERE

02:38:27.865 --> 02:38:29.466
THESE FUNDS GO THAT ARE GONNA

02:38:29.533 --> 02:38:33.036

ADULTS HAND TWENTY SOMETHING

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:46.529
KIDS THIS IS A DISASTER FOR

02:46:46.596 --> 02:46:49.232
EVERYBODY SO- THE GOVERNOR

02:46:49.299 --> 02:46:52.869
HASN'T. PLAN EVEN MORE

02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:53.503
AGGRESSIVE THE NEST. HAVING ONE

02:46:53.570 --> 02:46:55.038
ADULT FOR IT FOR TEN KIDS IN

02:46:55.105 --> 02:46:56.639
THE T. K. AND CAN OUR

02:46:56.706 --> 02:46:57.807

02:46:57.874 --> 02:47:00.510
YEARS SO. WE REALLY ARE MINDFUL

02:47:00.577 --> 02:47:02.645

MAKE THIS WORK. AS WELL THIS IS

02:47:04.748 --> 02:47:05.782
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN OVERNIGHT

02:47:05.849 --> 02:47:07.183
SO WE HAVE MULTIPLE YEARS TO

02:47:07.250 --> 02:47:08.718
PHASES SENT TO WORK ON THE WORK

02:47:08.785 --> 02:47:10.720
FORCE WORKING FACILITIES. BUT

02:47:10.787 --> 02:47:12.856
ALSO ALLOW OUR PROVIDERS AND

02:47:12.922 --> 02:47:15.091
CENTERS OUT THERE. TO WORK WITH

02:47:15.158 --> 02:47:16.826
US AND THEN I LAST THE AS I

02:47:16.893 --> 02:47:18.595
SAID IN THE LAST PANEL. NONE OF

02:47:18.661 --> 02:47:19.763
THIS WORKS UNLESS WE HAVE

02:47:19.829 --> 02:47:22.799
ADEQUATE- REIMBURSEMENT RATES

02:47:22.866 --> 02:47:24.768
IN A FEE STRUCTURE. TO PAY

02:47:24.834 --> 02:47:26.302
THESE PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE

02:47:26.369 --> 02:47:29.372
THAT CANCEL OUT SO- WERE 100%

02:47:29.439 --> 02:47:31.674
COMMITTED TO THAT- DID JUST

02:47:31.741 --> 02:47:34.043
AGAIN YOU KNOW- WE'RE COMMITTED

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:36.079

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:44.120
A WIN WIN WIN FOR ALL OF US.

02:47:44.187 --> 02:47:46.756
AND SO- WITH THAT- I THINK

02:47:46.823 --> 02:47:48.491
THAT'S ANOTHER STATE ON ON THAT

02:47:48.558 --> 02:47:50.460
ISSUE I WILL SAY ON THE OVERALL

02:47:50.527 --> 02:47:52.328

DOUBT ABOUT IT QUIT ASKING

02:48:02.972 --> 02:48:04.274
ABOUT IF AND WHAT AND WHEN PER

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:05.909
COMING BACK. UNLESS THERE'S

02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:07.277
SOME NEW VARIANTS ARE CRAZY

02:48:07.343 --> 02:48:08.411
SOMETHING HAPPENS DIFFERENT AND

02:48:08.478 --> 02:48:10.313
THEN WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL ADAPT

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:13.416
ADAPT TO THAT- I DO THINK THAT

02:48:13.483 --> 02:48:15.518
WE SHOULD. TIGHTEN UP THESE

02:48:15.585 --> 02:48:17.053
INDEPENDENT STUDY IN A VIRTUAL

02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:18.421
ACADEMY TYPE THINGS BUT THEY'RE

02:48:18.488 --> 02:48:19.656

DISTRICTS CAN DO THESE ANYWAY

02:48:27.964 --> 02:48:29.299
SO I DON'T SEE THERE AND THE

02:48:29.365 --> 02:48:31.468
NEED. TO DO SOMETHING TOTALLY

02:48:31.534 --> 02:48:32.936

ACHIEVEMENT OF THAT THE

03:08:21.790 --> 03:08:22.758
APPROPRIATE CREDENTIAL TO WORK

NEXT FIVE YEARS WHICH IS GOING

03:08:26.762 --> 03:08:28.463

03:08:28.530 --> 03:08:29.898
ONE ISSUE THAT WE THINK IS

03:08:47.449 --> 03:08:49.217
NEED TO TARGET IN THAT SPACE AS

03:08:49.284 --> 03:08:51.820
WELL. A DOUBLING THE NUMBERS OF
