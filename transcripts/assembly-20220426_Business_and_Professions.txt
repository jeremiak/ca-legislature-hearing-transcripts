BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK THE CHAIR AND THE CONSULTANTS WORKING WITH- MY TEAM OR TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER- HAVING A CRIMINAL RECORD CAN. MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR EVEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR INDIVIDUAL TO ENTER TO THE WORK FORCE EXPRESSLY. IN A FIELD THAT REQUIRES AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE WHEN EXAMINING- OTHER STATES THAT REQUIRE THE MOST OCCUPY OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING CALIFORNIA RANKS AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY WITH VERY STRANGE IT ARBAB REQUIREMENTS HOWEVER. OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROVISIONS OF THE STATE LAW LIMITS ACCESS TO LICENSE FOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED BY THE INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE REQUIREMENTS TO OBTAIN LICENSE ARE AMONG THE MOST RIGOROUS BASED ON HIGH COST AND LENGTHY EDUCATION. CALIFORNIA WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS OFTEN FACE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS THAT DISCOURAGE AND EXCLUDE. INDIVIDUALS WHO PAY UP FOR IT LICENSE LOOKING AND SEEKING FOR JOBS PEOPLE THAT ARE REJECTED FROM EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL INTO THE CYCLE OF CRIME MEMBERS IRATE I REPRESENTS A COMMUNITY ONE OF THE POOREST- DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS THAT PEOPLE. WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS TO FACE WHEN TRYING TO APPLY FOR A LICENSE PROFESSIONAL IS EXPENSIVE TUITION THAT COMES WITH EXPENSIVE TRAINING COURSES THIS MEANS TIME AND MONEY. WITH. WITH THE MOST CARE. IN GET DISCOURAGE AND FEEL HELPLESS AS A RESULT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON PROGRAMS THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS AND SOMETIMES YEARS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE JUST TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DENIED DUE TO THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD. THIS BECAUSE THOSE. ARE NOT TO BE REHABILITATED- IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE FUTURE IS ADDED IN. LET BE CLEAR. THIS IS AN AUNT POOL OF JOBS TALENT INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO CAN. IN A VERY POSITIVE WAY IN OUR SOCIETY BY HAVING HIS TIME THE LIVES THIS IS ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES AND HOPE LET ME UNDERSCORE IT'S ABOUT OPPORTUNITY AND HOPE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE A CRIMINAL RECORD SHOULD NOT BE A LIFE SENTENCE. FOR UNEMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY LICENSE JOB FOR INSTANCE COSMETOLOGY- BARBERING- A- OF FEEL- JUST TO NAME A FEW OF INDIVIDUALS OR INDIVIDUALS TRIED TO SEEK AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE- AFTER THEY'VE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AND PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY ARE HELD BACK. FROM THESE OPPORTUNITIES AND FROM HOPE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO IS FOCUSED ON GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK IMPROVING ACCESS TO LICENSED PROFESSIONALS AND ELIMINATING BARRIERS THAT KEEP INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE RE ENTRY PROCESS FROM OBTAINING AN OCCUPATIONAL LICENSE JOINING ME.

AS OUTSTANDING. BRING ABOUT TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES DR WEBER. GOOD MORNING CHAIR GOOD MORNING DODD WEBER SO- THE CALIFORNIA MASSAGE THERAPY COUNCIL AND LIKE MANY OF OUR OTHER BOARDS- IT IS A PRIVATE NONPROFIT NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION AND IN OUR ANALYSIS- A TALK ABOUT THAT THEIR ADVANTAGES THAT COME WITH CONSTRUCTING IT AS A NONPROFIT CORPORATION WHAT ARE THOSE ADVANTAGES I WILL DEFER TO MY TECHNICAL EXPERT THAT I ASSUME I HAVE ON THE LINE TO DISCUSS THE BOARD STRUCTURE- AND THE PROS AND CONS. OF SUCH A STRUCTURE- POSSIBLY ONE OF MY- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WERE HERE EARLIER. MR CLINTON. A QUICK ANSWER BRIGITTE. I THINK M. JUST A COUPLE REASONS AND HAPPY TO DO THIS IS KIND OF A SIDE BAR AND I DON'T REPRESENT THE MTC BUT IT'S VERY EFFICIENT IT'S ABLE TO FOCUS ON TRAFFIC IT'S DONE SOME AMAZING THINGS IN STOPPING TRAFFIC IN THE MIGHT BE DIFFICULT FOR I'M AT A LICENSING AGENCY TO DO. ITS PROVIDED A VERY KIND OF NICE BENEFITS AND AN IDEA TO THIS WHY YOU HAVE WE'VE DONE A COUPLE HEARINGS ON THIS IS WHETHER SUCH WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR SEEING TO SEE IT IT'S A VERY GOOD AT WHAT IT DOES IT'S AS YOU HEARD HIM TESTIFY THEY'RE OPEN EVEN SOME ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT WE THINK IT'S OF A NICE MODEL FOR HOW THINGS CAN BE DONE ONE OF THE THANK YOU REGION THEN ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE BIGGER THINGS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT- IN IN MY DISTRICT IS JUST THEIR ABILITY TO ACT VERY QUICKLY- WHEN. THEY THEY LEARNED THAT THERE'S INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR AND POSSIBLY EVEN WORSE YEAH FINAL ACTIVITY IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAPPENING AT AN ESTABLISHMENT HERE SAYING THAT IF IT WERE ACTUALIZADAS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO ACT QUICKLY THEIR CONCERNS THAT THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE IN THE PAST AND THAT YES THAT WOULD BE THE CASE. SO I'M SINCE. IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT TO ACTUALLY BE A LICENSED THERAPIST IT'S A VOLUNTARY- CERTIFICATE. AND THERE IS NO DEFINED SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR MASSAGE THERAPY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SINCE NOT EVERYONE HAS THIS LICENSE OR CERTIFICATE THERE IS REALLY NO DISCIPLINARY AUTHORITY OVER ALL OF OUR MASSAGE THERAPIST. I'M JUST WONDERING WHY WE HAVE CHOSEN TO REPEAL THE LANGUAGE TO. CONSIDER CREATING A LICENSE OR BOARD. SURE I THINK DURING THE DISCUSSIONS HAS BEEN DETERMINED THE END AND DURING DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS IT'S BEEN DETERMINEDTHAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS A DRESSING THE NEEDS- OF. AT LEAST A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY AS YOU KNOW- IS THAT YOU NEVER GONNA GET A HUNDRED PERCENT- HAPPINESS WITH ANY. KIND OF SOLUTION- BUT THERE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE HAPPY WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION AND- A LOT OF FOLKS WHO FEEL LIKE THE CURRENT SITUATION- IS BOTH ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF. HER MASSAGE THERAPIST AND ALSO OF LIKE I MENTIONED EARLIER KIND OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT- YOU. SPEND A LOT OF TIME IN THE SPACE AND HAVE CONCERNS AROUND- SOME INAPPROPRIATE AND ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON. AS THIS- BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FOR IT I HOPE THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS- I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A DESIRE WITHIN. A MASSAGE THERAPIST ACTUALLY HAVE- THEIR PROFESSION AS A LICENSED PROFESSION AS- MANY OF OUR- YOU KNOW OUR POSITION IS ACTUALLY A LICENSE BOARD. I'M AND ALSO YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT. NOT ONLY ARE YOU DEALING WITH SEX TRAFFICKING BUT YOU KNOW THE CONSUMERS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO GET THEIR MASSAGES. THERE THAT THERE SOME STANDARDIZED. LEVEL OF CARE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A BOARD. WITH AUTHORITY OVER ALL OF THE MEMBERS THAT ARE DOING IT SO- I JUST ASK THAT WE CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND REALLY RECONSIDER SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID ABOUT THE TIME THAT WE'RE- GIVING THIS EXTENSION AND ALSO THE FACT THAT. WE ARE CURRENTLY REPEALING. THE TAKING OFF THE TABLE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT CREATING AN ACTUAL BORN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR APPRECIATE THAT.

VERY DIFFICULT TO REBUILD DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES WHEN KEY SERVICES ARE ALSO DISPLACED IN A COMMUNITY. AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWO ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY FOCUSING ON STANDARDS THAT INCREASE THE FIRE SAFETY FOR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDINGS IN HIGH RISK FIRE ZONES BY SHARING THESE BUILDINGS HAVE A BETTER CHANCE REMAINING IN PLACE.

OKAY THE ROLE OF MEMBERS THE YOU THINK IT OUGHT TO THANK YOU. AND I SEE SANTIAGO STEINORTH ELEMENT OPEN JUST KIDDING YOU'VE GOT ONE MORE BILL I SHOULD KNOW THAT. GEN I NUMBER EIGHTEEN A BEACH SIX NINETY ONE BUT DOCTOR WOULD CHAIRMAN. REPRESENT LIKE TO START BY TECH ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND THANKING STAFF ONCE AGAIN FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. MEMBERS IT'S NO SECRET THAT SMALL CANNABIS BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE STRUGGLING. THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF CHALLENGES FACING THE INDUSTRY TODAY TAXES COMPLIANCE COSTS UNEVEN IMPLEMENTATION ILLICIT MARKET THE LIST GOES ON. ALL THESE ARE MULTI. AND COMPLICATED THIS BILL HOWEVER IS ATTEMPTING TO SOLVE A MUCH SIMPLER PROBLEM AS A STATE WE HAVE A RICH HISTORY OF PROMOTING AND SUPPORTING CRAFT BEER. ARTISANAL WINE AND FAMILY FARM AGRICULTURE PRODUCTS OF ALL KINDS. UNFORTUNATE FOR SMALL CANNABIS FARMERS UNLESS THE FARMERS HAS THE RESOURCES YOU VERTICALLY INTEGRATED THEY ARE PROHIBITED FROM SELLING ANY AMOUNT OF THEIR CANNABIS CONSUMERS AND MUST RELY ON DISTRIBUTORS TO SECURE SHELF SPACE ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS ON THEIR BEHALF. THIS LACK OF ACCESS TO CONSUMERS HAS MADE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SMALLEST CANOPY GROWTH RAFT OUT OF ITS FARMERS TO DEVELOP CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND DRIVE DEMAND. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY ONE SIMPLY ALLOWS CRAFT CANNABIS FARMERS THAT IS FARMERS WHO GROW LESS THAN ONE ACRE. ONE ACRE OF CANNABIS TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT AT LIMITED NUMBER OF LICENSED CANNABIS EVENTS. EMPHASIZE LICENSED CANNABIS EVENTS. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS NOT ALLOWING FARMERS TO THROW UP A FARM STAND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OR OPEN UP A SHOP. THIS IS ONLY FOR LICENSED AND LOCALLY APPROVED SPECIAL EVENTS. SUCH AS THE EMERALD COP IN THE CITY OF WHERE I LIVE IN SANTA ROSA. IT'S NOT ABOUT CIRCUMVENTING RETAILERS ARE PITTING ONE SIDE OF THE INDUSTRY AGAINST THE OTHER. THIS IS ABOUT GROWING THE INDUSTRY OVERALL. WE DON'T NEED TO LOOK ANY FURTHER THAN THE CRAFT BEER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE WHAT ACCESS TO UNIQUE AND HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS CAN DO FOR THE GROWTH OF AN INDUSTRY. MEMBERS YOU LISTED CANNABIS SENT MARKET IS WELL ESTABLISHED AS UNDERCUTTING OUR BEST EFFORTS TO STAND UP A REGULATED CANNABIS INDUSTRY. I FEAR THAT WITHOUT VIABLE PATHWAYS TO COMPLIANCE AND HEALTHY CONSUMER MARKETS WE WILL LOSE THESE FARMERS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THE RIGHT THING. YOUR TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT ARE- CARLA ABA LOW WITH THE TRINITY COUNTY AGRICULTURAL LANDS. AND ROSS GORDON WITH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND WE HAVE A MOTION FROM THE VICE CHAIR. ANYBODY WANTS A SECOND IT. GOT A SECOND. BIPARTISAN MOTION SECOND YES PLEASE WHEN YOU'RE READY. JUST HIT THE LITTLE BUTTON THE LAW MIGHT BUTTON. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MY NAME IS CARLA VILLA I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE TRINITY COUNTY AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE. I AM AN INDEPENDENT FAMILY FARMER AND HOMESTEADER MUCH LIKE THOUSANDS OF OTHER LEGACY CANNABIS PRODUCING FARMERS THROUGHOUT MY REGION. I HOLD A SINGLE TYPE ONE FIVE THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT SPECIALTY OUTDOOR COTTAGE WE'RE SORRY OUTDOOR SPECIALTY CULTIVATION LICENSE AND CULTIVATE CANNABIS ALONGSIDE DOZENS OF OTHER DIVERSIFIED CROPS. FOR SALE AT OUR LOCAL FARMERS MARKET. THIS DIRECT TO CONSUMER CONNECTION IS A AN ESSENTIAL PIECE OF HOW A SMALL FARM BUSINESS WORKS. OUR PRODUCE FARM WOULD NOT SURVIVE WITHOUT DIRECT RETAIL MARKETS. AND SMALL SCALE PRODUCERS LACK THE ABILITY TO MARKET DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS WE LOSE THE ARTISANAL VALUE OF OUR PRODUCT AND OUR SCALE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO SO. FROM WINE TO VEGETABLES TO CRAFT CANNABIS THIS MECHANISM IS HOW CRAFT SCALE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND RENOWNED GROWING REGIONS AROUND THE WORLD ARE RECOGNIZED AS UNIQUE AND DISTINCT AND MADE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. OUR STATES GLOBAL REPUTATION AS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SIGNIFICANT CANNABIS PRODUCING REGIONS WAS BUILT ON THE BACKS OF THOUSANDS OF SMALL FAMILY FARMS WHO ARE FACING AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS TODAY. WHAT WE STAND TO LOSE IN THIS MOMENT IS AN ENTIRE CULTURAL HERITAGEBUILT OVER MULTIPLE GENERATIONS THE GENETIC BIO DIVERT DIVERSITY OF OUR SEED VARIETALS AVAILABLE ONLY ON OUR FARMS. A REGIONAL ECONOMY THAT SPANS THE ENTIRE NORTH STATE AND FROM THE LEGAL SHELVES IS ABOUT TO DISAPPEAR THE CRAFT ARTISANAL HIGH QUALITY CANNABIS THAT CALIFORNIA'S GLOBAL REPUTATION WAS BUILT UPON. AB TWENTY SIX NINETY ONE WOULD BRING SMALL FARMERS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL TO SURVIVE AT OUR SCALE AT THIS MOST CRITICAL TIME AND AN ECONOMICALLY VIABLE PATHWAY FOR BRINGING UNIQUE SMALL SCALE BATCHES INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. BOLSTERING RETAIL ACCESS TO CONSUMERS WHEN IT IS MOST IMPERATIVE WE SUPPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CANNABIS TOURISM EXPANSION OF THE LEGAL MARKET FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR GLOBAL REPUTATION FOR CRAFT CALIFORNIA CANNABIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR GORDON. GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ROSS CORDON I SERVICE POLICY CHAIR WITH ORIGINS COUNSEL AND POLICY CHAIR WITH THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY GROWERS ALLIANCE. ORIGINS COUNCILS A STATEWIDE ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING NEARLY NINE HUNDRED MEMBERS ACROSS THE FULL CHEMICAL SUPPLY CHAIN BOTH OF THEM ARE SMALL AND INDEPENDENT LEGACY LICENSE CANNABIS FARMERS. REGULATED CANNABIS MARKET FACES MANY CHALLENGES IN THE CONTINUES TO BE A ROBUST ILLICIT MARKET FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT MADE THE TRANSITION INTO THE LEGAL AND LICENSED MARKET. A SMALL PRODUCER SPECIFICALLY WE FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGE OF MARKET ACCESS YOU DO A LACK OF TOOLS THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE IF ARE SMALL PRODUCERS OF ANY OTHER CRAFT AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT. IN OTHER SECTORS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA'S WORLD RENOWNED CRAFT WINE INDUSTRY OPPORTUNITIES FOR DIRECT TO CONSUMER MARKETING SUCH AS FARMERS MARKET SALES. ARE THE MECHANISM BY WHICH SMALL PRODUCERS APRIL TO COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WITH LARGER COMPETITORS. THESE OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT REPLACE TRADITIONAL RETAIL SALES RATHER AUGMENT THEM. BY PROVIDING APPROPRIATE MARKET ACCESS OPPORTUNITIES TO PRODUCERS WERE OPERATING ON A SMALL SCALE. IT'S INDEPENDENT PRODUCERS WE LIKE ACCESS TO MARKETING RESOURCES SUCH AS SALES TEAMS IN ADVERTISING BUDGETS THAT ARE OFTEN TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY LARGER BUSINESSES. VERTICAL INTEGRATION IS FINANCIALLY OUT OF REACH FOR NEARLY ALL SMALL PRODUCERS AND LOCAL LAND USEREGULATION CONSTRAINTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE SALES DIRECTLY FROM THE FARM. WHAT AB TWENTY SIX NINETY ONE WOULD MOST DIRECTLY IMPACT SMALL CANNABIS PRODUCERS IT'S POTS OF AFFECTED EXPENSE LEGAL CANNABIS MARKET AS A WHOLE. FILLS MY CRAP PRODUCES A CAMPUS EVENTS WILL DRIVE ADDITIONAL SALES THROUGH LICENSED DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL. IN CRAFT PRODUCERS TO SELL CANNABIS EVENTS OR THE STRONG INCENTIVE TO DIRECT THE CUSTOMERS TO LEGAL RETAILERS OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT CAN BE PURCHASED. WE ARE PROUD OF THE BROAD COALITION IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WHICH INCLUDES MORE THAN THIRTY FIVE DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING SMALL PRODUCERS. EQUITY BUSINESSES PATIENT ADVOCATES AND VETERANS GROUPS AND WE ASK SUPPORT TODAY TO PROVIDE EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA'S WORLD RENOWNED CRAFT CANNABIS PRODUCERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I BELIEVE WE ARE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- MISTER. MEHTA AND MR RIVERA WERE IN THE ROOM TODAY. OR NOT. MAYBE WORD EVER LAST MINUTE AUDIBLE. I DON'T. BUT WILL HAPPEN WHAT'S THAT THE HEART OF I AS WELL ABOUT MARVIN AND I GOT A- LOUISE RIVERA. BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE A CONSIDER. GO AHEAD. IN TWO MINUTES EACH. HELLO GOOD MORNING REGULATIONS AND OF MANY AS STRINGENT AND PROTOCOLS TO FOLLOW IN ORDER FOR US TO GET TO THIS POINT- WE OPPOSE AB- TWO SIX NINE ONE OF BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE RETAILERS- I THINK THE INTENT MAY BE WELL. BUT ULTIMATELY OF THE RETAILERS ARE ONES THAT SHOULD RETAIL OF WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS OF WE'VE MET. OF THE REQUIREMENTS. AND FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO BE ABLE TO COME IN- CIRCUMVENT KIND OF THE TAXES ON THE PROCESS I SHOULD SAY AND- THAT WE'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH. OF DOESN'T REALLY SPEAK TO I THINK THE ISSUES THAT ARE WE'RE DEALING WITH AND SOLVE THE PROBLEMS- IN ADDITION WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH ILLEGAL OPERATORS. WITH THE HIGHER HIGHER YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT PAYING ANY TAXES- ANNA SAYS RETAILERS POLICY PAYMENT- THE PRODUCTS. SELLING ABOUT DOUBLE WHAT SOMEONE CAN BUY A ILLEGALLY- WELL SIR COMPETING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPANIES CMING AND DELIVERY COMPANIES AND OTHER THAT ARE ABLE TO SELL IN OUR JURISDICTION SO AN ALTERNATELY WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THE FAMILIES THE CULTIVATORS AND THE RETAILERS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS- IN REGARDS TO THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND HOW HOW IT WORKS AS WELL OF CULTIVATORS NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO NECESSARY SAL WE STILL GOING TO HAVE TO GET IT THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DISTRIBUTION TESTING. ETCETERA SO THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE A NEED FOR THAT PROCESS TO BE FOLLOWED- BUT THINK THOSE RETAILERS AN EVENT LICENSE HOLDERS OF FOLLOW THAT PROCESS AND DONE THAT SO REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THAT MOVING FORWARD RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD- MANAGER ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED CAN WITH BUSINESS ASSOCIATION- WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO TWENTY SIX NINETY ONE- THIS IS A FOUR YEAR REUNION OF THIS BILL- AND SOME OF THE THINGS ISSUES WE HAVE IF WE LOOK AT TWELVE AND FOR I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DOWN TO EIGHT. THE NUMBERS ARE TWELVE AND SET FOR DAYS AT FORTY EIGHT DAYS PER LICENSEE- AT FORTY TWO HUNDRED LIFE AND FEES THAT PRETTY MUCH WILL OPERATE UNDERNEATH THE SMALL LICENSE- THAT BRINGS ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO NEW RETAILERS INTO THE MARKET ASCENTIAL EVERYDAY- I REALIZE THAT WE NEED MORE RETAIL- BUT THIS WAS NOT A DILUTION OF EXISTING MARKETS WHICH ALREADY HAVE RETAIL ACCESS AND THEM IN THIS TO BE A GREAT BILL IS A GREAT EXPANSION OF RETAIL THIS GIVES EVERYONE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET THEIR PRODUCTS WHICH I THINK IS VERY NECESSARY. BUT THIS CURRENT DILUTION OF AN EXISTING MARKET PUTS SOCIAL EQUITY GROUPS THAT AT AND HARM'S WAY- AND ALSO PUTS A BIG BURDEN ON THE STATE THE DCC THE DCC TO- PROCESS OVER FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS AND THAT FOUR THOUSAND APPLICATIONS EVERY TWELVE EVENTS WHAT IS THE COST OF DEATH LAST TIME IN APPROPRIATIONS WE GOT TO SOME POINT WHERE THIS COST WAS GOING TO BE ALMOST IN SOME PAUL. AND THE AMOUNT OF LICENSES WE NEED TO BRING ON TO ONLINE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS IS ALMOST A DISTRACTION I REALIZE THIS IS NECESSARY I'VE BEEN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GROWER FROM EIGHTEEN YEARS THIS IS NOT SOMETHING I'M DISTANT FROM. BUT AS A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA RETAILER I SEE THIS IS A DILUTION OF AN EXISTING MARKET WHERE WE HAVE ALMOST. SEVEN HUNDRED RETAILERS IN THAT MARKET AND WE DON'T NEED SEVEN HUNDRED MORE TO ENTER THAT MARKET ON ANY ONE DAY. SO THIS IS THE POSITION WE HAVE ALSO WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE CREATING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CREATE BANDS. AND WE SEEN THIS ALREADY IN LONG BEACH WHERE 75% OF ALL RETAILERS THAT COME INTO SPECIAL EVENTS. HAVE TO BE LOCAL FROM LONG BEACH MULTIPLE CITIES ARE TALKING ABOUT BANNING OUTSIDE RETAILERS FROM COMING IN TO SPECIAL EVENTS SO ALL WE'RE CREATING A BIGGER DIVISION. AMONGST THE SUPPLY CHAIN I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE DOING THIS I DO HEAR THE NEED I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEED THERE. BUT WE NEED TO EXPAND INTO NON EXISTING MARKETS NOW THAT IS WHERE IT'S GOING TO HELP REVENUE. THANK YOU MISTER GALLO THANK YOU WHAT YOU DID WAY BETTER THAN MR PANETTA EVER KIND OF- AND NOW OPENING IT UP TO- ANY ADDITIONAL ADD ON'S ANYBODY WANTS THAT ON IN THE HEARING ROOM SUPPORT.

GRAHAM BRING ABOUT A COLLEGE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS START WHEN MR CHEN- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK GD WOULD FOR BRING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE. MORE ACCESS FOR OUR CONSUMERS ARE CALIFORNIANS WHEN IT COMES TO CANNABIS- THERE'S NO DENYING THE MEDICAL. POWERS OF CANNABIS AS WELL AS- WE HAVE MORE FOLKS THAT ARE HAVING ACCESS IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A INDIVIDUAL BLACK MARKET OPERATORS YEAH. HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IN THE AREA. SATURATION SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED OUTDOOR CULTIVATORS FOUR. EIGHT TEMPORARY CULTIVATOR RETAIL LICENSES. AND THAT EQUATES TO MY UNDERSTANDING FORTY TWO. THOUSAND- LICENSES. SO IF THIS WAS TO CONTINUE WANT TO BELIEVE IN AREAS SUCH AS YOURS I REPRESENTS ORANGE COUNTY THE DEBATE OVER SATURATION- OF THESE RETAILERS- IN MY COMMUNITIES. I THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAN FOR THE QUESTION I DON'T BELIEVE THAT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EVERY LICENSE EVERY EVERY LICENSED. SMALL CANDLES OPERATOR WILL DO THIS- BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS- I THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. SMALL MEAN. MAYBE HUNDREDS OF DAVID'S VERSUS. A FEW GOLIATHS UP THERE- TAKE TO ACTUALLY GET THEIR PRODUCT IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. EXAMPLE THE EMERALD COP WHICH IS ONE OF THE PREMIER CANNABIS EVENTS IN IN CALIFORNIA. A SMALL GROWERS. CAN'T JUST SELL THEIR PRODUCT THEY CAN BRING IT AND HAVE IT HAVE IT JUDGE BUT THEY CAN'T SELL THEIR PRODUCT WITHOUT GOING TO A DISTRIBUTOR. NOW THAT IS THE WAY IT USED TO BE- WHEN THIS HAPPENED BUT BACK IN THE PROP TWO FIFTEEN DAYS OR EVEN EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS. IT'S JUST ABOUT GETTING MORE VARIETY GIVING THE SMALL GUYS A CHANCE AND- THAT I DON'T BELIEVE ITALY TOOK OVER SATURATION TIME BY EIGHT EVENTS WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT. EVERYBODY SETTING UP A SEPARATE LICENSE IT'S NOT. FOR ON A DAILY BASIS IS REALLY PRETTY LIMITED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ANSWER- I. HAVE BEEN A BIG PROPONENT OF EXPANDING CANNABIS- AT THIS CURRENT STAGE I'M HAVE TO LAY OFF. I DO RESERVE THE RIGHT AT THIS BILL MOVE FOR SOMEONE TO. LOOK AT WITH KEEN INTEREST ON TO TRY TO. HAVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME TO SUPPORT THE BILL LATER DOWN THE LINE. BUT I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE DR WOULD- FOR BRING THIS BILL IT TO OUR ATTENTION. THANK YOU SOME NUMBER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. DR WEBER. GOING BACK TO WHAT I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE THE ENTIRE TIME RUNNING IN BETWEEN COMMITTEES BUT- I'M- THERE SEEMS TO BE VIA PHONE AND ALSO WITH REGISTERED OPPOSITION- I'M ISSUE WITH SOCIAL EQUITY AND THE MINORITY COMMUNITY BEING OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. CAN YOU PLEASE ELABORATE ON. WHETHER OR NOT THEIR CONCERNS ARE VALID OR NOT. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE HAD OF WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WHO WERE SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSE HOLDERS RETAILERS IN THIS IN THIS ROOM HERE SO I WOULDN'T SAY THAT IS UNIVERSAL- IN THAT RESPECT WE ACTUALLY HAVE SUPPORT FROM EVERY ASPECT OF THE INDUSTRY- IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL SO. SO WHETHER MAYBE SOME CONCERN BY SOME SOCIAL EQUITY- LICENSEES- COMMON DENOMINATOR HERE IS ALL THE ALL THE OPPOSITION COME FROM LARGE URBAN AREAS AND THIS IS JUST A MICROCOSM WHAT I FIGHT EVERY DAY TO GET RESOURCES FOR MIGHT RURAL COUNTIES. UP AND THE WIND IT WASN'T JUST MY RURAL COUNTIES THAT REPRESENT HERE ACCOUNTS FROM ALL OVER THE STATE SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS IS NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY TO UNDERWRITE SOCIAL EQUITY IF THAT WERE THE CASE WE WOULDN'T HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSE HOLDERS TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THAT. YOU MAY HAVE MISSED THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF THE ROOM BUT- THANK YOU THEY DID. THANK YOU MISTER IBSON THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM BUT I WAS TRYING TO WATCH IT ON TV AND HEARD THE TESTIMONIES AND I LIKE- DOCTOR WEBER- REPRESENTS LOS ANGELES IN A LOT OF SOCIAL EQUITY- INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME- WITH RESPECT TO THEIR BELIEVE THAT THERE'S WOULD DISENFRANCHISE THOSE SOCIAL EQUITY GROUPS AND I REALIZED I DID HEAR. SOME OF THE AYE VOTES- FOR ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENT SOME SOCIAL EQUITY HOWEVER- THIS IS- THE CONCERNS- DO YOU BUT AS IS BILL MOVE FORWARD- I JUST NEED YOUR INSURANCE THAT YOU'LL CERTAINLY BE WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO I'M STRENGTHENED TRY TO FIND A MIDDLE GROUND THAT PEOPLE CAN WHO ARE REGISTERED OPPOSITION YOU CAN'T PLEASE EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE WORKED SO HARD IN LOS ANGELES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S SOCIAL EQUITY ESPECIALLY AMONG THOSE IN THE CANDICE BASS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN- WHO ARE EXISTING THE LOS ANGELES AREA TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD- AND THEY'RE FILLING THAT THIS IN FACT THIS BILL WOULD. DISENFRANCHISE THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND SO I NEED NEED TO MAKE SURE- THAT THAT CONSTITUENCIES VOICES HEARD IN THIS SPACE BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THEIR VOICES ARE TAKEN IN CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD WHAT I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN AND MY DOOR IS ALWAYS OPEN ALWAYS HAPPY TO WORK WITH- WITH BOTH SIDES ON AN ISSUE- YOU KNOW. I JUST THINK OF THE THOUSANDS OF LEGACY FARMERS MULTI GENERATION FARMERS THAT ARE ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO IS IT OKAY TO TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN. PROSPER THEY CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL. IS THAT IS THAT OKAY LIVELIHOODS AWAY THIS DOESN'T I BELIEVE IN ANYWAY TAKE AWAY LIVELIHOODS MATTER FACT I BELIEVE BY BRINGING MORE PRODUCTS OUT THERE AND MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO SEE A WHAT THE QUALITY OF ARTISANAL GROWERS CAN BE IT'S A PLUS FOR THE INDUSTRY. I CAN'T HELP RIGHT NOW THE LACK OF RETAIL OUT THERE THAT'S THE SPACE OUT THERE THAT WAS PUT IN THE PROPOSITION. DO AND THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LOCAL CONTROL IF THERE WAS A WAY TO CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC WE'D BE ALL OVER THAT. BUT RIGHT NOW IT DOES APPEAR TO BE A SO THIS NOT ANYTHING ATTEMPT UNDERMINE ANY EQUITY. BUT I WOULD JUST ASK FOR CONSIDERATION FOR SOME OF THE LEGACY FARMERS. WHO WILL LOSE THEIR FARMS WHO LOSE EVERYTHING. AND- I JUST I WAS AFTER SCHOOL. AND SURGEON MISTER MAY I. AND CERTAINLY IS NOT OUR INTENT OR MY ARTICULATION THAT WE WANT TO HURT ANYONE ESPECIALLY THOSE THOSE FARMERS- CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES SPECIFICALLY IS DEALING WITH AN UNDERGROUND ECONOMY BLACK MARKET WHO ARE YOU KNOW WHO WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT. WE REALLY SERIOUS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PUT THAT BUSINESS OUT OF BUSINESS I'M MOVING FORWARD SO THAT THE LEGAL- GROWERS AND CULTIVATORS CAN CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW DO THAT AND NOT BE BEAR WITH THE AMOUNT OF TAXES ALSO DEALING WITH- THE ILLEGAL ILLICIT BLACK MARKET UNDERMINING- THIS LEGAL PROFESSION THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE VOTED INTO LAW- SO WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT. AS WELL SO IT WAS A THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I SUPPORT THAT AS WELL- WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ALLOW LEGAL- LICENSED OPERATORS TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE BLACK MARKET TO NOT. NAME IS GIVEN ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES THE NON DOCTOR WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE- I JUST JUST A THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT THESE WERE NOT ALL MY CONSTITUENTS I JUST WANT TO STRESS ONCE AGAIN THAT WOULD HAVE BROUGHT WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM EVERY ASPECT OF THE INDUSTRY HERE- AND THIS IS NOT A MEANT MEANT TO UNDERMINE ANYTHING. THIS IS A CLASSIC STRUGGLE OF SMALL RURAL AREAS TRYING TO COMPETE WITH LARGER BEEN AREAS I DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY FROM A LOT FROM A SMALL RURAL AREA. IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL BUT I EVERYTHING I DID HERE WAS ALL ABOUT LARGE URBAN AREAS AND BATTLE THAT'S TO GET EXPAND RETAIL ACCESS HERE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THAT IS ABOUT GETTING PRODUCTS TO MARKET GIVING THESE FARMERS A CHANCE TO SURVIVE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY AND THAT BUT BUT DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE YOU YOU KNOW WE HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTARY- THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A REMARKABLY COMPLICATED SPACE WITH A LOT OF MOVING PIECES NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE WRAPPED UP IN YOUR BILL- THAT BY. YOU KNOW ONE I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION- WITH THE CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE- TO ENSURE THAT THE BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN UPLIFTING SMALL CANNABIS CULTIVATORS- WITHOUT UNDULY DISADVANTAGING. LICENSED CANNABIS RETAILERS AND WITH THAT- I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANKS MR SECRETARY PLEASE CALL VOTE.

TO IMPLEMENT ON FUTURE BILLS I SEE MR SANTIAGO SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE- WITH ITEM NUMBER THREE ON THE AGENDA AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE PHONE NUMBER SANTIAGO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. HEY MISTER CHAIRPERSON LIKE TO TAKE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE WOULD CREATE EDUCATIONAL NOTICING REQUIREMENT. AS A POTENTIAL ADOPTERS OF DOGS AND CATS WOULD KNOW HOW TO TREAT THEIR PETS- NEARLY ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS ADOPTED PETS DURING A PANDEMIC. HOWEVER NONE OF THE SHELTERS OR AGENCIES WERE REQUIRED TO HAND OUT ANY SORT OF. A STANDARD FOR CARE OF THESE. OF THESE- ANIMALS. BEING PETS AND DOGS. AND CATS. NOW THAT THE STATE WILL BE HARDER FOR OWNERS TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL CARE THAT THE WAR- WHILE THEY WERE STAYING AT HOME. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY ONE REQUIRE SHELTERS AND ADOPTION AGENCIES TO POST THE WELL FOR DOGS AND CATS NOTICED EDUCATE POTENTIAL. ADOPTERS HEALTHCARE- DOGS AND CATS SHOULD BE TREATED PART ADOPTION SO THAT THE ANIMALS RECEIVED- A LIFE OF PROPER CARE AND ATTENTION. WE HAVE TO WITNESSES MISTER CHAIRMAN THE SIZE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR- WORKING WITH US- AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH A NECKLACE AS A CAT AND THEN- JUDY- MANGUSTA WHO'D BE ON THE PHONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR BRING PROCEED YEAH THANKS VERY MUCH. HELLO CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SACKETT DIRECTOR OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION PROUD SPONSOR OF THE BILL. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO A. P. P. A. NATIONAL PET OWNERS SURVEY 70% OF U. S. HOUSEHOLDS ON A PET. WHICH EQUATES TO NINETY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION HOMES ANIMAL COMPANIONSHIP BECAME ESPECIALLY APPEALING DURING THE ISOLATION OF THE PANDEMIC. WE CELEBRATE AMERICANS OPENING THEIR HOMES TO DOGS AND CATS WHO NEED A LOVING FAMILY. BUT WITH THE STATE RE OPENING SADLY SOME ADOPTERS ENCOUNTER CHALLENGES IN CARING FOR THEM AND HAVE OPTED TO RELINQUISH THEM TO SHELTERS OR RESCUE GROUPS. CURRENTLY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE ANIMAL SHELTERS AND RESCUE GROUPS MAY BUT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO INFORM POTENTIAL ADOPTERS OF THE STANDARDS OF CARE DOGS AND CATS DESERVE. TO ENSURE THESE ANIMALS ARE TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND HAVE GREATER ODDS OF STAYING IN THAT HOME. POTENTIAL ADOPTERS MUST FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT DOGS AND CATS REQUIRE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF CARE THAT IT TENDS TO ALL OF THEIR NEEDS. THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD OCCUR PRIOR TO MAKING WHAT SHOULD BE A LIFELONG COMMITMENT TO THAT ANIMAL. DOGS AND CATS HAVE NEEDS BEYOND FOOD WATER AND SHELTER WHICH IS WHAT CURRENT LAW REQUIRES. DOGS AND CATS SHOULD BE RESPECTED AS LIVING BEINGS THAT HAVE PHYSICAL MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH NEEDS. IN FACT STUDIES CITED IN THE JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS HAVE SHOWN THAT DOGS CAN EXPERIENCE POSITIVE EMOTIONS. AS WELL AS OTHER SIMILAR. EMPATHIC RESPONSES THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF FELINE PRACTITIONERS HAS ALSO STATED THAT CATS EXPERIENCE THEIR OWN EMOTIONAL A MOTIONS THAT NEED TO BE SUPPORTED. THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO EDUCATE POTENTIAL ADOPTERS OF THESE IMPORTANT NEEDS. TO HELP MINIMIZE FUTURE BURNING QUESTIONS NOT ONLY ARE WE RELINQUISHMENT TRAGIC FOR BOTH THE ANIMAL AND THE FAMILY. BUT THEY ALSO COST TAXPAYERS MONEY TO RE HOME OR EUTHANIZE THE ANIMAL. TO BE CLEAR THIS LAW PUT INTO PLACE EDUCATIONAL DISCLOSURES. TO AN ADOPTER THE BILL DOES NOT PENALIZE AN ADOPTER IN ANY WAY. THE ONLY MINOR PENALTY WOULD BE TO A SHELTER OR OTHER LISTED ENTITY WHICH REFUSES TO POST THE NOTICE AFTER A SIXTY DAY WARNING PERIOD WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SACKETT- AND NEXAVAR BELIEVE WE HAVE MS MAKE- SO ON THE PHONE OPERATOR IF YOU CAN IDENTIFY HIS MAKERS AS LANDO. LETTER TESTIFIED. PLEASE GO AHEAD. I THANK YOU VERY HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS JUDY MAN INCLUSO FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION ABOUT WHAT MY GROUP HAS BEEN WORKING ON- BILLS TO MINIMIZE THE SUFFERING OF DOGS AND CATS IN SHELTERS FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS AND WE'VE MADE GREAT PROGRESS BUT THERE IS STILL ROOM TO DO MORE AND WE WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SANTIAGO OR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. IT IS AN EDUCATIONAL BILL ALL AND DURING THE PANDEMIC THE SHELTERS WERE CLOSED SO YOU MAY HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION BAD THEY'RE NOT TAKING IN AS MANY ANIMALS BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THE DAUGHTERS WERE SHOT AND THE MANY RESCUES HAD TO PICK UP THE SLACK AND- ARE INUNDATED WITH ANIMALS THAT ARE BEING RELINQUISHED SO- I'M HERE TO SPEAK- AS NEEDED- AND THEY'RE STILL ANIMALS BEING EUTHANIZED WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THANK THANK YOU MS MECHANISM APPRECIATE THAT AND I HAVE TO WITNESSES.

IMPOSED BY DIFFERENT TYPES ANIMALS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW ANIMALS ARE STILL LIVING BEINGS ARE NOT TOYS THEY'RE NOT FLUFFY. TEDDY BEARS OF LIKE THAT TO THE POINT TO REMIND THEM OF THEIR NEEDS LIKE THAT. SO I'M VERY MUCH HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER YES MR GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- WHEN READING THIS BILL THE ANALYSIS AT LEAST TO ME IT BECAME A STATEMENT OF THE OBVIOUS THERE ARE TIMES WHEN STATING THE OBVIOUS IS BOTH APPROPRIATE NEEDFUL THIS WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE TIMES JUST TO CLARIFY BASED ON WHAT WE HEAR FROM OPPOSITION SOMEONE COULD TRULY JUST GO ONLINE AND LOOK UP THE BILL COPY AND PASTE THE BILL OF RIGHTS. PRINTED ON AN EIGHT BY TEN PIECE OR A NAP BY ELEVEN PIECE OF PAPER AND TAPE IT TO THE FRONT DOOR THEIR BUSINESS OR OF THE SHELTER AND WITH THAT FULFILL THE REQUIREMENT THIS BILL WELL I'M NOT A WRITTEN NOTICE OF THIS INTENT TOWARD FULL PHILIP THAT'S- CORRECT. AND THEN IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT DONE AND SOMEONE COMES AND BRINGS IT TO THEIR ATTENTION OF AUTHORITY THEY HAVE ACTUALLY SIXTY DAYS TO DO THAT ONE MINUTE ACT THEY HAVE SIXTY DAYS TO CORRECT THAT THANK YOU. I'LL SUPPORT HIM AS A GRAYSON ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. I NEED A MOTION AND SECOND. GOT GOT MOST GOT A SECOND MRS SANTIAGO DEAL TO CLOSE YEAH I THINK ESPECIALLY AYE FOR NOVEL BUT WOULD LIKE TO CORRECT THREE THINGS FROM THE OPPOSITION NUMBER ONE IS NOT GOING TO SHAME SOMEBODY WITH A TO TELL THEM THAT A DOG OR A CAT OR A CAT TO. LIVE FREE FROM EXPLOITATION THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE NUTRITIOUS FOOD APPROPRIATE VETERINARIAN KERR- OR IDENTIFIED THROUGH A TAG OR MICROCHIP THESE ARE ALL THESE THINGS AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION FROM MY COLLEAGUE THAT'S A GREAT SHAME SOMEBODY IF YOU HAVE THERE IF IT'S NOT THE RIGHT FIT IT'S NOT THE RIGHT FIT- SECOND- IT. IT DOESN'T JUST ATTACK ONE. GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE THEY SAID IT WOULD ACT. IT ALSO DOES RESCUE GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE- A AND- I MEAN I JUST WANTED TO CLEAR THOSE UP REALLY QUICKLY THAT IF. IT IS THE OBVIOUS IBAT WE WANT TO STATE. THAT THIS IS THE CARE- THAT A DOG OR A CAT SHOULD HAPPEN. SO I DON'T FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND IN OUR INTENT AND WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. TO ENSURE THAT THAT THIS LAND IN THE RIGHT SPOT TO IN THAT THE INTENT IS MADE OUT THAT THAT A CAT OR A DOG. SHOULD HAVE. THIS SET OF CARE- I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND WE DEMONSTRATE THAT WE WANT TO WORK BUT- IT IS UNREASONABLE SAY WE'RE GOING TO SHAME THAT. SOMEBODY FROM GETTING A DOG IT'S GOING TO PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM- RESCUING A DOG THIS IS NOT THE CASE- IMPACTED HOPE TO EDUCATE. ON WHAT CARE IT REQUIRES- SO THAT IT MAY BE YOU CAN'T YOU CAN'T DO THAT SORT OF CARE. MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT PET POINT. YOU GO SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR DIFFERENT SORT OF PAT. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR PUTTING A LOT OF A TIME INTO THIS. WE THINK OF LANDIS- IN THE DIRECTION WE NEED TO GO AND THANK MR THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUMMER SANTIAGO- THE ONLY QUESTION THAT I HAD WHEN I WAS INITIALLY REVIEWING IT IS. YEAH MY BROTHER HAS A DOG- I HAVE A DOG. HIS DOG REALLY ENJOYS A LIFE OF COMFORT FREE OF FEAR AND ANXIETY. BUT MY DOG HER MENTAL STIMULATION IS. TORTURING HIS DOG YET SO WHO. WHO GETS TO DO WHAT THEY WANT WAS WHERE I STRUGGLED BUT I THINK MY DOG'S GONNA WIN OUT- SHE OFTEN DOES. MATHIS HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM I HAVE A FOUR POUND YORKIE THAT JUST CARE RIGHT MY HUNDRED POUND EXACTLY A GERMAN SHEPHERD. YEAH IT'S EXACTLY RIGHT AS OUR SITUATION TO YOU. THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS- CERTAINLY WE ALL SHARE THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT ALL ANIMALS HAVE A SAFE CARING HOME WHEN THEY'RE ADOPTED.

AB IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR THE CULMINATION OF WORK BETWEEN OUR SPONSOR HOLLERS AND CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE CLEAR LABELING AND STOP THE MARKETING OF THESE PRODUCTS AND ANYWAY IT IMPLIES WE CAN DISPOSE OF IN IT. IN TRASH OR RECYCLING SYSTEMS THAT ARE CLEARLY LABELED SURE THE CONSUMERS WHERE THEY MUST BE DISPOSED OF AS A HAZARDOUS WASTE- ACCORDING TO FDA VAPES CAN CATCH FIRE EVEN EXPLODE AND SERIOUSLY HURT PEOPLE. TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES JOINING ME TODAY I HAVE JORDAN WELLS WITH THE NATIONAL STEWARDSHIP ACTION COUNCIL AND AMY JENKINS ARE PRESENTED CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

BUT YEAH NUMBERS JACKSON DRAGON PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION I WANT TO BEGIN BY THINKING THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL FOR PRO ACTIVELY WORKING WITH C. C. I. A. AND THE BROADER INDUSTRY THIS REALLY IS A CONSENSUS BILL THAT CONTINUES TO PERMIT. THE MANUFACTURE AND USE OF NON RECHARGEABLE VAPING PRODUCTS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ADVANCING SENSIBLE PROVISIONS AIMED AT PROMOTING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY OF THESE PRODUCTS CCA HAS A VERY PROUD TRACK RECORD OF SUPPORTING POLICIES THAT ENCOURAGE THE USE OF RECYCLABLE AND ARE BIODEGRADABLE MATERIALS I'M REDUCING LANDFILL WASTE IN PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE USE- WHILE MOST NON RETRACTABLE CANVAS VAPES ARE MADE WITH RECYCLED MATERIALS. THEY ALSO CONCLUDE INCLUDE LITHIUM ION BATTERIES AND HEATING ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE I WOULD NOTE THAT NON RECHARGEABLE PRODUCTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY USED BY PATIENTS FOR THEIR EASE O USE- AND SO AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC IS AWARE THAT THESE NEED TO BE PROPERLY DISPOSED- WELL ALLOWING PATIENTS TO CONTINUE TO ACCESS THESE PRODUCTS SO FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL INNER DRIVE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'VE GOT WE'RE VOTING NOW WE SKIP THINGS AND WE ARE OFF TO VOTING- DO WE HAVE JORDAN WELLS VIA PHONE. YEAH CAN YOU HEAR ME I CAN'T THANKS.

AB EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR FROM REQUIRE AN INTEGRATED CANNABIS VAPORIZER OR BETTER KNOWN AS A CANNABIS VAPING DEVICE OR DATE TO PROMINENTLY DISPLAY THAT IT MUST BE DISPOSED OF AS HAZARDOUS WASTE AND WILL PROHIBIT ANY MESSAGING THAT EIGHT THAT IS DISPOSABLE OR IMPLIED THAT IT MAY BE THROWN IN THE TRASH OR RECYCLING. ACCORDING TO THE STATE WIDE RECYCLING COMMISSION THERE'S A SERIOUS TRUTH IN LABELING PROBLEM FOR WHAT PRODUCERS ARE CLEANING ON THEIR PRODUCT LABELS REGARDING RECYCLABILITY AND PROPER DISPOSAL WHICH LEADS TO CONFUSION AND IMPROPER DISPOSAL OF MANY PRODUCTS. THE THING ONE OF THEM. ONLINE WE HAVE FOUND MANY PRODUCTS ARE LABELED DISPOSABLE AND SOME EVEN STATE OUTRIGHT THAT THEY CAN BE THROWN IN THE TRASH OR IMPLIED THEY CAN BE DISPOSED OF IN THE TRASH. OR DO NOT INCLUDE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT PROPUBLICA'S. TO GAS. CONFUSE CONSUMERS ARE DISCARDING BATES AND THEIR HOUSEHOLD TRASH OR RECYCLING BINS WHERE THEY CAN AND DO. CAUSE EXPLOSIONS AND FIRES THAT CAN RESULT IN COSTLY DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND THE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE POTENTIAL TO HURT PEOPLE WORKING IN THE WEEKS INDUSTRY. AND THE THING IS ON THE RISE. IN THE MARKET FOR SINGLE USE BATES IS INCREASING YET THERE ARE MANY REUSE REUSABLE AND RECHARGEABLE OPTIONS READILY AVAILABLE. WE ARE DELIGHTED THAT THE INDUSTRY HAS PARTNERED WITH US ON THIS BILL TO PROPERLY INFORMED CONSUMERS OF CORRECT DISPOSAL. WELL WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN THAT CANNABIS EIGHT THE REQUIRED TO BEAR MANY LABELS SO DO OTHER PRODUCTS WHICH ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO LABEL WITH IMPORTANT DISPOSAL INSTRUCTIONS.

ON THIS BILL- BEING NECESSARY- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I'M NUMBER TWO WE ALSO AGREED THAT THE MESSAGE THAT THEY AND SHE WANTS TO DELIVER IS THE RIGHT MESSAGE. WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DELIVERING IT IN A WAY THAT IT ACTUALLY GETS THE ATTENTION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURCHASING CANNABIS PRODUCTS WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT AS ADDITIONAL PROPOSALS ARE OUT THERE RELATIVE TO ADDING MORE AND MORE. I TO THE EXISTING CANNABIS PRODUCTS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS CREATING VIRTUAL WHITE NOISE THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THESE PRODUCTS AND DECIDING- ARE NOT DECIDING NOT MAKING DECISIONS BASED ON WHAT THEY SAY THEY'RE JUST IGNORING WHAT THEY SEE- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE DO- I USE AS AN EXAMPLE AND I THINK ALL OF US WILL ADMIT AT LEAST PRIVATELY. ON THAT WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO PROP SIXTY FIVE WARNING SIGNS BECAUSE THEY ARE EVERYWHERE AND THEY DON'T TELL US ANYTHING THAT WE NEED TO KNOW WE DON'T WANT THE SAME THING TO HAPPEN TO CANNABIS PRODUCTS BECAUSE THOSE PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERING VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGES. LIKE PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULDN'T- USING WITHOUT CONSULTING A DOCTOR I'M SHOULDN'T BE AND GIVEN TO THE CHILDREN AND MESSAGES LIKE THAT- BUT WE HAVE TALKED WITH THE SPONSOR AND THE AUTHOR- WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN FIND SOME. YOUR AGREEABLE WAY OF DELIVERING THE MESSAGE SO THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DO GET THE MESSAGE- AND OBVIOUSLY I THINK THE BILL WILL PROBABLY MOVE FORWARD TODAY BUT WE HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US.

THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN I FLOOR. LOOM M. I. BONTA FONG GIPSON. GRAYSON WHEN I WHEN I LEE I MAY I MCCARTY MEDINA MEDINA AYE MULLIN SALAS TANG. WEBER. WE WE'VE LOST ALL OUR COLLEAGUES SO THAT BILL SIX VOTES AND ONLY THE ROLE ABSENT FOR A RULES WILL BE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS I SEE MISTER COURT HEARS NOTHING I'M GONNA BRING MISTER CORK UP TO PRESENT THE GENOCIDE NUMBER SEVEN AB TWENTY TWO TEN AND THEN WILL BRING BACK TO YOU SOME RELIEF FOR. THE SUMMER BARKING IN THE BILL. DR CORK READY WHENEVER YOU ARE. IT IS STILL MORNING GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. OF I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS IN PARTICULAR- IT WOULD REQUIRE THAT CANNABIS PRODUCTS TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL OF RETAIL PREMISES BE KEPT IN THEIR ORIGINAL PACKAGING THAT MAKES TOTAL JUST LOADS OF SENSE IT'S CERTAINLY WHAT WE INTENDED AND THEN THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL IN CLARIFYING CHANGES WHICH WERE ALSO HAPPY TO ACCEPT AMENDMENT- AB TWENTY TWENTY CHAPTERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALLOWED GOVERNMENTS TO GRANT TEMPORARY LICENSES. FOR THE SALE OF CANNABIS IS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED VENUES. HOWEVER SOME VENUES HAVE BEEN DENIED CANNABIS TEMPORARY EVENT LICENSES ON THE BASIS OF THE VENUE HOLDINGA CURRENT ALCOHOL BEVERAGE LICENSE GLORIFIES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIAL CANNABIS EVENT LICENSES ESPECIALLY FOR VENUES WITH CONCURRENT CONCURRENT ALCOHOL LICENSES BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS JUST A SPENDING- ALLOWING THE ALCOHOL LICENSE TO BE SUSPENDED FOR THAT TIME WHEN THIS IS HAPPENING UP UNTIL FIVE AM THE NEXT MORNING SO THAT THERE'S NO WAY THAT YOU CAN HAVE ALCOHOL AND CANNABIS THE SAME ADVANTAGE. OF ONE OTHER OBJECTION PEOPLE HAVE HAD IS THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MINERS YOU'RE NOT AT THESE CANNABIS EVENTS WHICH SHALL WE AGREE WITH ICE IN THE PROPOSITION THAT CETERA SO WE'RE WE'RE FINE WITH THAT AS WELL- WITH ME TODAY IS- AMY JENKINS- REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. AMY THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AMY JENKINS AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY. CCA WAS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION AB TWENTY TWENTY WHICH PERMITTED THE ISSUANCE OF TEMPORARY EVENT LICENSES FOR THE SALE AND CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS EVENTS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY A LOCAL JURISDICTION. THIS HARD FOUGHT LEGISLATION WAS CAREFULLY WHEN NEGOTIATED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS TO THAT END WE INCORPORATED A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST THE CONSUMPTION OF CANNABIS ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO ON THE SAME PREMISES. THE OTHER IMPORTANT PUBLIC SAFETY PROTOCOLS AIMED AT DETERRING YOUTH ACCESS AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY WHAT WE DIDN'T CONTEMPLATE WAS ABC GUIDANCE WHICH WOULD INTERPRET- THESE CANNABIS TEMPORARY EVENTS TO BE IN CONFLICT WITH THEIR EXISTING LICENSING. AND SO WHAT IS THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES BAND THAT EVENTS TEMPORARY EVENTS HAVE BEEN SEVERELY CONSTRAINED BECAUSE MOST LOCATIONS POSSESS AN ABC ALCOHOL LICENSE SO WE APPRECIATE THE SPELL. ON THE WORK OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS PROVIDED THAT THERE LOCALLY APPROVED AND MEETS ALL THE SPECIFICATIONS ALREADY CAREFULLY CRAFTED IN STATUTES SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND ARGYRIA VOTE THANK YOU.

THIS IS FOR A GENERAL NUMBER NINETEEN AB TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY FOUR STRAINS PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN FIFTY FOUR FOUR SOMEWHERE BAR QUE HAN I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT ON HER BEHALF THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS WHICH ADDED URGENCY KLAUSING CLARIFIED DEFINITION OF SUPERVISION. WELL WITH THAT TODAY A PRESENT THIS BILL WHICH WOULD ENSURE THAT TRAINEES IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHOLOGY RECEIVE NECESSARY TRAINING IN A SAFE AND TIMELY MANNER EXTENDING SUPERVISION TRAINS AUDIO AND HIPPA COMPLIANT VIDEO CONFERENCING. CALIFORNIA'S EXPERIENCING A DIRE SHORTAGE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND GRAPPLING WITH MEETING THIS NEED ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH FOR CENTER CALIFORNIA IS ON TRACK TO LOSE 41% OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND DECADE. THIS ON TOP OF EXISTING SCARCITY UNDER CURRENT LAW PSYCHOLOGY TRAINEES IN CALIFORNIA COURT TO RECEIVE THREE THOUSAND HOURS REVISED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE AS A CONDITION TO RECEIVE THEIR LICENSE TO PRACTICE AS PART AS OUR TRAINEES REQUIRED BE SUPERVISED 410% OF THE TOTAL TIME WORKED EACH. WEEK AND HAVE AT LEAST ONE HOUR PER WEEK OF FACE TO FACE DIRECT INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION WITH A PRIMARY SUPERVISOR. THIS MEANS THAT AT LEAST ONCE EVERY WEEK DURING A TWO YEAR PERIOD A TRAINEE HAS NO CHOICE. BUT TO BE IN CLOSE QUARTERS ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL HEALTH PANDEMICS. RESPONSE-GOVERNORS M. TEMPORARILY WHAT TEMPORARILY WEIGHED FACE TO FACE A PROVISION AND PROVIDE SUPERVISION TO BE DONE. REMOTELY VIA HIPPA COMPLIANT VIDEO DESPITE THE CONTINUED SPREAD OF COVER NINETEEN THE RISKS ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONS BILLS WORKING CLOSE QUARTERS THE EMERGENCY WAIVER WAS ONLY EXTENDED UNTIL MARCH THIRTY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH HAS NOW OF COURSE EXPIRED. THIS BILL SEEKS THE REMEDY IS I IMMEDIATELY CODIFYING THE FACE TO FACE A PROVISION WAIVER. THIS WILL PRESERVE ACCESSING CONTINUE CONTINUE WITTY TO PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE CALL AND SERIOUS. SERVICE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS ARE OF THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION AND ABA RASHID. LEGISLATIVE ADVENT ADVOCATE FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS RIGHT. GOT A MOTION. GOT A SECOND TWO MINUTES EACH PLEASE. READY WHEN YOU ARE. A GOOD MORNING AFTERNOON HERE IN MEMBERS YEAH MY NAME IS- COLLINS WERE AS DIRECTOR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAF PRESENTING. THE SENATE WOMAN TARA CAN COULD NOT BE HERE FOR- AUTHORING THE BILL. SO YOU HEARD PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINEES MUST RECEIVE THREE THOUSAND HOURS OF SUPERVISED PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE WITH AT LEAST ONE HOUR EACH WEEK BEING FACE TO FACE INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION. THAT MAN'S THAT OUR TRAINEES HAVE TO SCHEDULE THEIR ENTIRE WEEK TRAVELING ATTENDING. COSTS AROUND A SINGLE HOUR. THANKFULLY AN EXACT ORDER DURING THE PANDEMIC ALLOWED TO THE FACE TO FACE REQUIREMENT TO BE WAIVED OUR TRAINEES NEEDING TO RECEIVE THE SUPERVISED HOURS ARE ABLE TO USE WIDELY AVAILABLE VIDEO CONFERENCING TECHNOLOGY. AND CONTINUE THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT A SAFE RELIABLE MANNER. HOWEVER AT THE MOMENT THE GOVERNOR LIVES THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT WOULD ALSO IMMEDIATELY AND THE WAIVER IF THEY'RE REGULATORY SOLUTION IT'LL ITS ARRIVAL WOULD NOT BE FORTHCOMING FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BOTH PSYCHOLOGY TRAINEES INTO PROVIDERS HAVE REPORTED VIRTUAL SUPERVISION TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT AT A DEGREE EQUIVALENT. TO IN PERSON SUPERVISION WE ALSO SAW NUMEROUS BENEFITS TO THOSE BEYOND THOSE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. TRAINEES ARE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH A LARGER POOL SUPERVISOR SINCE THEY WERE NO LONGER RESTRICTED BY ACCESS TO A VEHICLE OR TRANSIT. TRAINEES MOST OF THEM FACING SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL LOANS AND DEBTS WERE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AND TIME WILL STILL RECEIVING DIRECT SUPERVISION. SEVERAL INSTANCES WE HEARD STORIES OF TRAINEES HAVING TO TRAVEL SEVERAL HOURS EACH WEEK AT THEIR OWN COST IN HEAVY TRAFFIC. SUPERVISORS COULD MORE READILY SCHEDULE TRAINEES OR SUPERVISION SESSIONS AND STREAMLINE THEIR OWN SCHEDULING. AND BOTH TRAINEES AND SUPERVISORS HAVE REPORTED AN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS THEY WERE ABLE TO SERVE DUE TO EFFICIENCY SINCE TRAINEES ALSO SERVE PATIENTS DURING THE CLINICAL TRAINING. LIKEWISE ABOARD PSYCHOLOGY'S CONTINUE EXTENSION OF THE WAIVER IT HIGHLIGHTED ITS EFFICACY AND USEFULNESS. NEITHER THE BOARD pCOMPLAINTS ABOUT YOUR VIRTUAL SUPERVISION IN FACT WE'VE RECEIVED OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM OUR MEMBERS. FURTHER OUR BILL WOULD NOT OBLIGATE SUPERVISORS AND TRAINEES TO COMPLETELY ELIMINATE FACE TO FACE SUPERVISION IN THE FUTURE. IF TH TRAINING SUPERVISOR SEE VALUE THEY WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO DO SO. GPA BELIEVES THAT THIS BILL IS BOTH TIMELY AND NECESSARY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IMPROVE DELIVERY OF TRAINING FOR FUTURE LICENSE PSYCHOLOGIST. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE YOUR MUCH. THANK YOU TURN MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY MY NAME IS AMBER SHE'D.

A CODIFYING ONE OF THE FLEXIBILITIES CREATED BY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND THIRTY NINE TWENTY. THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WAVED FACE TO FACE REVISION REQUIREMENTS AND SAID A LOT FOR SUPERVISION TO OCCUR- VIA AUDIO HIPPA COMPLIANT VIDEO CONFERENCING AS YOU'VE HEARD. THIS FACE TO FACE REVISION WAIVER DAY PRACTITIONERS THE ABILITY TO EXPAND CAPACITY AND PROTECT THEIR HEALTH WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON PATIENTS SUPERVISORS OR TRAINEES. ALTHOUGH INITIALLY MEANT TO BE TEMPORARY NUMEROUS BENEFITS OF THIS LABOR HAVE EMERGED OVER THE PAST YEAR AND THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED IMPROVE SAFETY EXPANDED PRACTITIONERS AVAILABILITY. ADDITIONALLY THE FACE TO FACE WAIVER ALLEVIATE A PUBLIC HEALTH CONSTRAINTS- AND REDUCE COSTS TO TRAINEES AND SUPERVISORS. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC RESTAURANT BOTH INCREASED DEMAND ON THE PART OF PRACTITIONERS. WHERE THE FLEXIBLE AND SAFE MODE OF SUPERVISION AS WELL AS ADVANCES IN HIPPA COMPLIANT VIDEO CONFERENCING- AND FOR TRAINING SUPERVISORS LOSING THE ABILITY O PARTICIPATE IN SUPERVISION REMOTELY PUTS AN UNDUE BURDEN ON THEIR SAFETY AS WELL AS THE TIME. ADDRESSING ALL OF THE CURRENT BEHAVIOR WORKFORCE CRISIS.

WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM TEMPORARILY WAIVED FACE TO FACE A PROVISION AND ALLOW FOR REMOTE SUPERVISION IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY PRACTITIONERS WERE ABLE TO EXPAND THEIR CAPACITY AND PROTECT THEIR HEALTH WITHOUT ANY NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF PATIENTS.

AS DO IT AGENDA ITEM EIGHT AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY FOUR. READY WHEN YOU ARE SICK THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN CHAIR BERMAN AND MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- NARROWING IN FOCUSING ON DEFINITIONS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REAL ESTATE IN CALIFORNIA AND USUALLY WHEN SOMEBODY SELLS OR PURCHASES A PROPERTY THEY WORK WITH A LOCAL REAL ESTATE BROKER TO HELP THEM COMPLETE THAT TRANSACTION HOWEVER IN RECENT YEARS WITH TECHNOLOGY AND THE ADVENT OF INTERNET OPTIONS INTERNET BUYERS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET. AYE BUYERS ARE ESSENTIALLY ONLINE COMPANIES THAT USE AUGER THAN TO BUY AND SELL PROPERTY EXISTING DATA INDICATES THAT THESE COMPANIES ARE PURCHASING MOREPROPERTIES AND THEY'RE ABLE TO SELL MANY TIMES THESE HOUSES THE ON THE MARKET THIS INDICATES- A NUMBER OF PROPERTIES AT SIT IDLE AND SOMETIMES REMAIN VACANT FOR MONTHS I USUALLY IF THERE'S A PROBLEM PROPERTY IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. AND THERE'S A REAL ESTATE SITE ON THERE BUT IF PEOPLE DO THEY CALL THE NAME OF THE AGENT AGENT KNOWS THEIR COMMUNITIES LIKE OUR REAL ESTATE AGENT HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN WITH THESE AYE BUYERS AYE WE'RE THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL HIGH PROFILED LOCAL NEWS REPORTS IN MY DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY. ABOUT VACANT PROPERTIES AND HAVE PROBLEMS AND NOT HAVING AN ADEQUATE INDIVIDUAL TO GO AND WORK WITH TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION SO THIS BILL WOULD BE SIMPLY REQUIRE THAT THE I. BUYER WORK WITH A LOCAL REAL ESTATE BROKER WHEN SELLING THE PROPERTY. AGAIN LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENTS OR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ALLEN SURE THERE IS OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROPERTIES WHEN THEY ARE PUT AT PURCELL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES AND I HAVE A LISA LOPEZ LOZANO A LOCAL REAL ESTATE AGENT HERE TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH READY WHEN YOU ARE. MAYBE JUST THE BUTTON THAT SAYS MY RIGHT IN FRONT. NOT NOT NOT RUN MIGHT RUN MIKE. HI THERE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND BRENT IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR I THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR INTRODUCING A SPELL ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TO TWENTY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE AN I. BUYER TO WORK WITH LOCAL REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS WHEN SELLING PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA. IN RECENT YEARS I BUYERS HAVE BECOME MORE ACTIVE IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET DIRECTLY PURCHASING AN INCREASED AMOUNT OF HOUSING STOCK IN MANY INSTANCES THESE PROPERTIES WILL REMAIN VACANT. AND MAINTAINED AND ATTRACT ILLICIT ACTIVITIES WHEN THE HOMES ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING SOLD. BUT AT BY REQUIRING AN I. BUYER TO WORK WITH LOCAL REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS IT WOULD ENSURE PROPER OVERSIGHT AND MAINTENANCE OF THE PROPERTIES. OUR LOCAL REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS ARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE AT WHO ALSO KNOW THE MARKET BAST AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE BEST YOU WORSHIP FOR THESE PROPERTIES AND AT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT IT YOU KNOW WHILE IT'S BEING **** AT IT IS THE REASON. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY TWO. TWENTY FOUR THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I DON'T.

THE PRESENT AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWELVE AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX READY WHEN YOU ARE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE DECLINE PROCEDURE OR- AT. AND THE KNOCKED ME ON ANY CAT EXCEPT WHEN THERE IS THE THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE STILL MOTION. THANK YOU I WILL KEEP MY REMARKS SHORT UNLIKEHUMAN NAILS WHICH GROW FROM SKIN CAT CLAWS GROW FROM THE BONE MEANING AMPUTATION OF THE LAST BONE IN EACH TOE IS NECESSARY. TO REMOVE THE CLAUSE THIS IS AN INHUMANE PRACTICE ON ANIMALS THAT CONTINUES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECLINE CAN LEAD TO UNWANTED BEHAVIORS LIKE LITTER BOX AVOIDANCE AND BITING BECAUSE THE CAT HAS NO OTHER WAY TO DEFEND ITSELF. I HERE TO TESTIFY- WE HAVE A INDIVIDUAL IN- OVER THE PHONE I BELIEVE HOPEFULLY WERE ABLE TO GET THE MONEY THAT'S LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCILMEMBER AND FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER PAUL CORRECT AND HERE IN THE ROOM WITH THIS IS DR JENNIFER CONRAD WHO IS THE FOUNDING DIRECTOR OF THE POP PROJECT. AND THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL GREAT WHEN WE START. WHEN WE START IN THE ROOM WITH THE DOCTOR CONRAD AND THEN WILL MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES FOR COUNCILMEMBER KRETZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DR JENNIFER CONRAD I'M A LICENSED VETERINARIAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE POP PROJECT A CALIFORNIA BASED NONPROFIT. DECLINING IS THE EQUIVALENT OF TAKING A CIGAR CUTTER TO EVERYONE OF A CAT'S TOES. AB TWO SIX OH SIX WOULD ONLY PROHIBIT. THE AMPUTATION OF CAT TOBAN TWENTY IT'S NOT MEDICALLY INDICATED. THE BILL ALLOWS US TO PRACTICE MEDICINE IN THE EVENT OF PATH OLOGY THE WE VETERINARIANS COULD ABSOLUTELY STILL AMPUTATE THE TOES YOU MAY HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT DECLAWING IS RARE BUT IN THE JOURNALS AND IN THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS IT'S ACTUALLY PERFORMED ON 2224% OF AMERICAN CATS. THE CDC THE NIH AND U. S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ALL SAY A DECLAWING IS NOT ADVISED FOR IMMUNO COMPROMISED PEOPLE IN FACT SUGGESTING THAT IMMUNO COMPROMISED PEOPLE DECLARE CATS BY DOING THAT THE OPPOSITION IS ACTUALLY PUTTING THESE PEOPLE IN JEOPARDY BECAUSE DECLAWED CATS BITE MORE IT'S IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE AND BITES ARE WORST AND SCRATCHES. FINALLY DATA FROM CALIFORNIA SHELTERS WHERE DECLINE HAS BEEN BANNED SHOWS THAT THAT RELINQUISHMENT RATES WENT DOWN AFTER THE BAND'S WENT INTO EFFECT DECLAWING IS ILLEGAL IN MUCH OF THE REST OF WORLD IT RECENTLY BECAME ILLEGAL IN MARYLAND AND IT HAS BEEN ILLEGAL IN NEW YORK STATE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND I HOPE THAT CALIFORNIA WILL BE THE NEXT STATE TO BAN IT WITHOUT A REQUEST YOUR I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THE ACCOUNT NUMBER CORRECTIVE WE HAVE YOU ON THE LINE. HI CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN THANKS. GREAT WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF THE LA CITY COUNCIL AND I AUTHORED THE SUCCESSFUL ANTI D. CALL ON THE CITY OF LA MORE THAN A DECADE AGO. THAT ORDINANCE IS GOING TO BENEFIT BOTH OUR CITY'S CAT POPULATION AND OUR LARGE ANIMAL SHELTER SYSTEM. IMPOUNDING OF CATS IS THE FONG SOME 43% SINCE WAS ADOPTION. HELPING US ACHIEVE NEAR NO KILL STATUS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX COULD BRING THAT KIND OF PROGRESS STATEWIDE. AS A MEMBER OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY I AUTHORED AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN ENACTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR WHICH PROHIBITED THE DECLINE OF WILD OR EXOTIC CATS. EXCEPT FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX IS MODELED ON THAT BILL. THE PRACTICE OF DECRYING IS VIEWED BY MANY VETERINARIANS AND ANIMAL ANIMAL EXPERTS AS AN ACT OF CRUELTY. THAT WAS DESCRIBED IT LITERALLY INVOLVES AMPUTATING PART OF THE CAT'S PAWS AND CAN CAUSE EXTREME PAIN AND DISCOMFORT. AND AFTER THE PROCEDURE CARE HAS TROUBLE JUMPING A LANDING AND IN SEVERE CASES BOTH DOMESTIC AND WILD CATS OF BECOME LEHMAN EVEN PARALYZED. THE CAPS FOR DEFENSE MECHANISMS OTHER CLAUSE WHEN THESE ARE GONE WHAT'S LEFT WITH THEIR ABILITY TO FIGHT. THE CARD CAPS REBEL BY BITING AND BY NOT USING THEIR LITTER BOXES AND OFTEN WIND UP IN ANIMAL SHELTERS FIFTY SEVEN THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OPPOSES THIS BILL. THEY DON'T OPPOSE MY BILL BECAUSE FEW OF THEM DECLAWED BIG CAT SO IT DIDN'T AFFECT THEIR BOTTOM LINE. ON THE OTHER HAND CAPTAIN LA WERE DECLINED MOSTLY BECAUSE OF VETERINARY MARKETING. CAT OWNERS AN ALLY AREN'T CLAMORING TO DECLAWED THEIR CAT. AND WE DON'T RECEIVE COMPLAINTS IN OUR OFFICE BECAUSE CAN'T CAN'T BE DECLAWED IN OUR CITY THIS IS A CRUEL AND UNNECESSARY PRACTICE THE BENEFITS NO ONE BUT THE VETS DOING THE SURGERY. WHICH NO LONGER INCLUDES THE HUGE VETERINARY CHAIN VCA. IF CAN. THEIR PROFITS THE WHOLE CRUELTY OTHER VETS COULD AN SHOULD DO THE SAME. AND SOME NUMBERS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SIX CENTS A- THANK YOU COUNSEL REGRETS- AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO WIN THIS PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- ONE IS DR KEITH ROAD- WITH THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN PERSON HERE TODAY. AND THEN JESSICA C. FOR MEN WITH THE VET NICK VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD VIA PHONE WHEN WE START IN THE ROOM- WITH DOCTOR WROTE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR KEITH ROADIE I'M A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION'S BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND ITS PRESIDENT ELECT. I'M A TWO THOUSAND SIX GRADUATE OF THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE NAY I'M A CO OWNER OF WOODLAND VETERINARY HOSPITAL RIGHT BEEN. PRACTICING FOR SIXTEEN YEARS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SIX OH SIX BASED ON MY LONG STANDING INVOLVEMENT IN CVM A LEADERSHIP I CAN ATTEST THAT THE ISSUE OF KHAKI CLAD HAS INDEED BEEN FRONT AND CENTER IN OUR ASSOCIATION FOR MANY YEARS. IN FACT THE CDMA NOW HAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST YOU CLASS STATEMENTS OF ANY VETERINARY MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN THE COUNTRY. PURSUANT TO THAT POLICY THE CDMA STRONGLY DISCOURAGES OWNERS FROM DECLINE THEIR CATS AND THE CV MAY RECENTLY HOSTED TWO WELL ATTENDED SEMINARS ON ALTERNATIVES TO DECLAWING CATS. BUT OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT DECLINE SPECIFICALLY. I'M NOT PRO DECLINE I HAVE TWO INDOOR CATS WERE NOT DECLAWED. AND IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE DOCTORS IN MY HOSPITAL UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO STOP IN THE PROCEDURE AT OUR HOSPITAL. THAT BEING SAID OUR CONCERN IS THAT THIS BILL IF SIGNED WOULD CREATE A PRECEDENT STATUE THAT DIRECTLY IMPACTS OUR LAWFUL SCOPE PRACTICES VETERINARY PROFESSIONALS. AND WOULD DO SO IN A SITUATION WHERE THE PROFESSIONALS ALREADY SELF REGULATED MUCH OF THAT DECLINE. AS TO WHERE IT'S NOW RARELY. RARELY PERFORMED. IT IS CONCERNING TO THINK THAT AT ANY TIME AN OUTSIDE GROUP MAY HAVE AN AVERSION TO A SIGNIFICANT SURGICAL PROCEDURE TREATMENT. THAT GROUP WOULD BE ABLE TO MEMORIALIZE A BAN. OF THAT MEDICAL PROCEDURE INTO LAW AND TRULY THAT GOES FOR ANY HEALTH PROFESSION NOT JUST VETERINARY MEDICINE. YOU MAY ASK IF A GOOD MAJORITY OF AT THE VETERINARY PROFESSION IS TRENDING AWAY FROM THE SURGERY THEN WHY NOT JUST BAN IT. THEN WHAT WE DO AND THE VERY RARE INSTANCES WHERE WE HAVE A CLIENT WITH AN AUTISTIC CHILD IN THE HOUSE AND THE CAT IS SCRATCHING THAT CHILD. OR SENIOR CITIZEN WHO LIVES ALONE AND HAS A CAP TO PROVIDE SOME WITH COMPANIONSHIP BUT THEY'RE TAKING COUMADIN OR CHEMOTHERAPY AND CAN'T RISK BEING SCRATCHED. SHOULD THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO RELINQUISH THEIR CATS THE CVM IS SHORT AND SIMPLE ANSWER IS NO. AND BOTH OF THE EXAMPLES I JUST GAVE THE CAT OWNERS WOULD SHOULD BE COUNSELED ABOUT THE SURGERY THE WHOLE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ISSUE SHOULD BE CLOSELY CONSIDERED AND THE SURGERY SHOULD BE PERFORMED AS A LAST RESORT BASED ON THE PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT AT THE VETERINARIAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT AUTHORITY. NEXT UP- IF WE'VE JUST CÁC FOR MEN. VIA THE PHONE.

ISSUES LIKE THIS WE HAVE TO PASS THIS BILL SO HAPPY TO BE A OFFICE MAKE THE MOTION AND- BUT FOR TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS I THANK YOU SOMETIME EARLY. AND WEBER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- JUST A QUESTION. TWO YEARS TO YOUR- SUPPORT WITNESS. SO IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO- HAD A CAT AND TO MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY AND THEY END UP. WITH THE STROKE OR DVT AND THEY'RE NOW ON BLOOD THINNERS. HOW DO YOU COUNSEL THEM WHAT DO YOU OFFER THEM OUTSIDE OF DECLINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND UP DR I'M WHAT WE WOULD SAY IT WAS YOU CAN KEEP THE NAILS TRIMMED YOU CAN PUT. US WHAT'S CALLED SOFT PAWS WHICH ARE VINYL SHE'S ON THE NAILS AND- THERE ARE OTHER WAYS THE REST OF THE WORLD WHO- WHERE. CAT DECLAWING IS ILLEGAL ARE CONSIDERED UNETHICAL PEOPLE ARE LIVING WITH STROKES WERE OR ARE NEURO DIVERGENT AND THEY ARE ABLE TO LIVE WITH CATS WITH CALLS SO JUST BY THE CDC RECOMMENDS CUTTING THE NAILS. AND I'M NOT PLAYING WITH THE CAT WITH THEIR HANDS AND- AT BUT LEAVING THE CLAWS ON BECAUSE DECLAWED CATS ABSOLUTELY BITE MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. I'M DECLINE SOUNDS LIKE A VERY YOU KNOW AND HUMANE OUR PROCEDURE I. IT WAS HONESTLY VERY MOVED BY YOUR TESTIMONY- AS ANOTHER SURGEON IT IS REALLY CHALLENGING TO HAVE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF YOUR FIELD. I DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF SURGERIES YOU CAN AND CANNOT DO AND- YOU KNOW AS AN OBGYN WE HAVE HAD THAT DONE AS WELL- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I THINK HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IS NOT NECESSARILY- BANNING A PROCEDURE LIKE STERILIZATION OF YOU KNOW MINORITY WOMEN BUT ACTUALLY PUTTING MORE SAFEGUARDS AROUND IT. SO THAT- PEOPLE ARE VERY WELL INFORMED OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING GIVING TIME AND OPTIONS. AND SO- AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD I WILL SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK. WITH OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY THAT YOU CAN STILL ALLOW FOR- MEDICAL. AND VETERINARIAN- JUDGMENT TO COME INTO PLAY TO ALLOW FOR- THEIR OPINION AND THEM TO BE THE FINAL DECISION MAKERS IN SOME CASES THAT MAY BE. YOU KNOW. VERY RARE BUT STILL ALLOWING THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY- BEFORE COMES TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE IT IS. THE CALL AS FROM ONE SURGEON TO ANOTHER. I FEEL EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR WEBER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE AS A MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WAS ACTUALLY HOPING- WITH YOUR INDULGENCE MISTER CHAIR THAT OUR DOCTOR WHO'S ALSO A VETERINARIAN CAN RESPOND TO THAT. SURE SURE THAT'S GREAT. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND DR WEBBER- AS A VETERINARIAN MYSELF. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS BILL LETS US CHOOSE WHEN IT IS A THERAPEUTIC. PURPOSE IT'S A THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE IF THERE'S A TUMOR IN THE TOTAL IT'S NOT A THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE IF THE PEOPLE WANT THE CAT TO STOP SCRATCHING THE COUCH THERE'S ALSO- LOOKING AT THE OWNER AND JUST THE ENTIRETY SO WHEN BRINGING IN SOME OF THESE VERY RARE KIND OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS A DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE- THE VETERINARIAN AND- AND THE ACTUAL OWNER ITSELF GIVING THAT. OPTION BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION FROM A SUMMER MCCARTY. JUST FOLLOWING UP I KNOW THIS BILL WAS- PRESENTED A FEW TIMES BEFORE. AND ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS WHO LEADS TO THE FOLLOW UP HERE FROM DR WEBER'S QUESTION. IT IS IT I KNOW YOU SAID THE CALLOUS EXAMPLE AND SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE DECLINE PEOPLE WOULD ABANDON THEIR PETS MORE BECAUSE OF THEIR PERSONAL ISSUES WITH THEIR FURNITURE WHAT HAVE YOU. BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS EXAMPLE IF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR THEIR OWN. YOU KNOW HEALTH REASONS NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- IN A SAFE PLACE A PROTECTED ARE WE AT ALL CONCERNED THAT. THE WE WOULD LOSE MARC CATS FOR AS FAR AS ABANDONMENT. YOU DO NOT HAVE SPECIFIC EXEMPTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBER THANK- SO EVERYWHERE WE BANDY KLEIN WHICH IS MORE AND MORE PLACES IN MARYLAND JUST PASSED THE BAN RECENTLY WE HAVE FOUND. THAT THE NUMBER OF CAPS RELINQUISH HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY ANANT AND COUNCILMEMBER KRETZ EVEN ALLUDED TO IN LOS ANGELES THE NUMBER WENT DOWN 43% AND THAT TRANSLATES TO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CATS LIVES SAVED AND IT THE CONCERNED ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH REMEMBER THAT. HUMAN HEALTH AUTHORITIES LIKE THE CDC AND I H. U. S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY OF AMERICA ALL AGREE THAT DECLAWING IS NOT ADVISED TO PROTECT HUMAN HEALTH THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT THAT DECLAWING IS AN ANSWER THEY BELIEVE COMMONSENSE PRACTICES ARE AN ANSWER AND PLEASE REMEMBER THAT IT'S IN THE LITERATURE THAT DECLAWED CATS. FIGHT MORE AND A BITE WOUND IS A FAR MORE SERIOUS INJURY THAT A SCRATCH. BATCHES THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT AS A MEMBER CARILLO YARD CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU- TO THE MEMBERS FOR THE CONVERSATION- I WOULD JUST SAY YOU KNOW IT'S ONE IT'S INHUMANE IT'S CRUEL BUT YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER DECLINE IT'S BEST FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ARE BEST FOR THE ANIMAL AND WHAT I HEARD TODAY WAS CONTRADICTING TESTIMONY FROM THE OPPOSITION AND UNFORTUNATELY THE VETERINARY MEDICAL BOARD HAS ACTUALLY NOT SUBMITTED AN OFFICIAL LETTER OF. OPPOSITION AND SO WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACTUALLY WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THIS CONVERSATION IS ARISING AND SO I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH OPPOSITION AND WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT WE COME TO AN AGREEMENT. BUT YOU CAN'T COME TO COMMITTEE AND OPPOSE SOMETHING WITHOUT HAVING INFORMED US OF WHAT YOUR OPPOSITION TO YOUR CONCERNS ARE AND NOT ACTUALLY SUBMITTING A LETTER OF OPPOSITION TO ACTUALLY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS SO FIRST AND FOREMOST. DECLINE A CAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE CAT'S NOT GOING TO BITE AND SO IF THE CONCERN IS FOR AN AUTISTIC CHILD OR FOR A SENIOR CITIZEN THE REALITY MAY BE THAT HAVING A CAT MAY NOT BE THE ANSWER WHAT THAT INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND THERE ARE OTHER SOLUTIONS TO THAT AS OUR OWN VETERINARIAN INTO AND WITNESS TESTIMONY TODAY. HAS STATED THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO NOT HAVING TO DECLAWED CAT THAT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO THE HEALTH OF THE CAT OR THE ANIMAL ITSELF AND SO WHILE THIS BILL PROHIBITS AN INDIVIDUAL FROM DECLINE A CAT IT DOES ALLOW FOR THE NECESSARY SURGICAL PROCEDURES TO BE PERFORMED ON A CAT'S PAW FOR DEFINED THERAPEUTIC PURPOSE AND WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH US LIMBER CREO AND THANK YOU FOR CHAMPIONING THIS ISSUE WHICH WHICH I DO UNDERSTAND HAS A LONG HISTORY.
