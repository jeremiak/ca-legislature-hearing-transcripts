00:37:39.624 --> 00:37:41.025
CURRENT PENALTIES AND THE LAWS

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:44.595
ARE DEEP AREAS WHERE FAMILIES

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:47.031
ARE IN ENCOURAGED AND IN FACT

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:48.833

00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:54.372
IT IS SCIENCE SHOWS THAT

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:56.374
IMMUNIZATIONS ARE GOOD FOR KIDS

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.408
AND THEY'RE NOT ONLY GOOD FOR

00:37:57.475 --> 00:37:58.643
KIDS THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.544

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.854
WE SWEATERS AND ALONG POVERTY

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.622
SUPPORTS IMMUNIZATION UP BUT IF

00:38:11.689 --> 00:38:12.923
YOU BELIEVE IN SCIENCE THEN YOU

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.191
ALSO BELIEVE --

00:38:14.258 --> 00:38:15.726
THE REPORT AND THE NUMEROUS

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:17.928
RESEARCH RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE

00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.563
THAT PROVE THAT MAKING A FAMILY

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:20.398
POOR --

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:23.034

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.135
BECOME VACCINATED.

00:38:24.201 --> 00:38:25.202
IF YOU BELIEVE IN SCIENCE YOU

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:26.604
KNOW THE REPORTS SAY THAT IF YOU

00:38:26.671 --> 00:38:28.706

TO EXIT POVERTY AND WE DO

00:38:31.776 --> 00:38:34.211
BELIEVE THAT EDUCATION IS ONE OF

00:38:34.278 --> 00:38:35.713
THE BEST PASS OUT OF POVERTY --

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.515
BUT THE SIZE ALSO SHOWS.

00:38:37.581 --> 00:38:39.316
THAT MAKING FAMILIES POOR --

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:40.918
DOESN'T HELP THEIR CHILDREN.

00:38:40.985 --> 00:38:42.319
AT THE SCHOOL IT DOESN'T HELP

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:44.221

OUR ORGANIZATIONS POSITION IS

00:39:27.098 --> 00:39:29.467

FOR NOT VACCINATING.

00:39:30.835 --> 00:39:31.936
IS WHEN A CHILD'S MEDICAL

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:37.007
HOWEVER WE NEED EFFECTIVE

STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT FAMILIES

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.711
TO ENCOURAGE IMMUNIZATION.

00:39:40.778 --> 00:39:42.313
STRATEGIES THAT WILL SUPPORT AND

00:39:42.379 --> 00:39:44.181
EMPOWER FAMILIES TO ACCESS ALL

00:39:44.248 --> 00:39:46.851
THE SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THEM.

00:39:46.917 --> 00:39:48.385
IN MEDI CAL.

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:50.054
NOT POLICIES THAT ARE

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:52.423
INEFFECTIVE AND DRIVE FAMILIES

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.091

FURTHER HARDSHIPS.

00:40:02.066 --> 00:40:04.435
PENALTIES ARE AN ILL CONCEIVED

00:40:04.502 --> 00:40:06.737
POLICY ATTEMPT TO FORCE FAMILIES

ANYMORE IF THESE WILL WORK

00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.212
BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY DON'T.

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.781

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.143
TO RECIPIENTS SO --

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.946
CHILDREN DID NOT THE VACCINATION

00:44:09.013 --> 00:44:10.514
SO USUALLY UP.

00:44:10.581 --> 00:44:13.384
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS --

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:14.918
THE SCHOOL IS STILL REQUIRE

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:18.022

FOR FOOD STAMPS NO THE BENEFITS.

00:44:29.299 --> 00:44:30.634
SO IT IS --

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:33.404
ELIMINATING ONE MORE GOVERNMENT

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:37.174
RATS IN A WET PAPER SO I'M OR

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.008

OUR LOW INCOME FAMILY TEND TO BE --

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:55.059

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.327
MAYBE AT THE GROUP WAS CHILDREN

00:44:57.394 --> 00:44:58.595

00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.897
THERE ANY.

00:44:59.963 --> 00:45:02.633
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FREE

CHILDREN FROM THE LOW INCOME

00:45:16.613 --> 00:45:18.348

00:45:18.415 --> 00:45:20.984
WE NEED TO FOCUS UPON AND HELP

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.019

00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:27.484
SCRAMBLE TO PUT TOGETHER SOME

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:28.718
SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE TRACKING

00:51:28.785 --> 00:51:30.687
SYSTEM TO TRACK THESE THESE

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:31.455
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE HAVE TO

00:51:31.521 --> 00:51:32.622
BILLING --

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:35.192
AS FAR AS CONSUMERS GO IT ALSO

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.293
MEANS YOU KNOW THIS IS A

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:37.794
FINANCIAL HIT TO PROVIDERS I

00:51:37.861 --> 00:51:39.095
KNOW THAT THE STATE HAS YOU KNOW

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:41.064
PUT A PRICE TAG ON IT BUT I I

00:51:41.131 --> 00:51:41.665
DON'T THINK ANYONE'S REALLY

00:51:41.731 --> 00:51:45.035
CAPTURED THE THE TRUE REFLECTION

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:47.370
I THINK. ONE OF OUR PER AND

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.039
REVENUE I THINK MANY OF YOU KNOW

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:49.773
THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.907
DISABILITY SYSTEM IS ALREADY

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:52.375
CHRONICALLY UNDERFUNDED SO ANY

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:54.177
OF THESE CUTS BEING BROUGHT BACK

00:51:54.244 --> 00:51:56.079
IS USUALLY PROBLEMATIC --

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:57.714
AND FROM A CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.249
THAT'S A PROBLEM WE HAVE WE HAVE

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:00.750
PROGRAMS THAT ARE CLOSING WE

00:52:00.817 --> 00:52:02.586
HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE HURTING --

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.354
AND WEIGHTLIFTING PEOPLE BECAUSE

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:05.922
THEY CAN'T HIRE STAFF EVERY

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:07.257
DOLLAR THEY'RE NOT PULLING IN

00:52:07.324 --> 00:52:08.492
AND REVENUE IS ANOTHER DOLLAR

00:52:08.558 --> 00:52:09.025
THEY'RE NOT PUTTING INTO

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:09.860
SERVICES.

00:52:09.926 --> 00:52:10.694
FURTHERMORE SOME OF THOSE

00:52:10.760 --> 00:52:12.462
CONSUMERS WHO HAVE COMPLICATED

00:52:12.529 --> 00:52:14.297
ATTENDANCE RATES MAY END UP

00:52:14.364 --> 00:52:15.565

SERVED BY A PROVIDER GOING

00:52:16.933 --> 00:52:18.635

ADMINISTRATIVELY AND FINANCIALLY

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:32.616
AND AND ON THE IMPACT CONSUMERS

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:33.950

FRAZIER FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:45.228
WHEN WE BROUGHT TO HIM WHEN IT

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:46.596
CAME OUT JUNE TWENTY SEVENTH

00:52:46.663 --> 00:52:48.064
THAT WE HAD EMPLOYMENT ON JULY

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:49.032
FIRST.

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.400
THE IMPACT TO CONSUMERS REALLY

00:52:50.467 --> 00:52:52.936
IS WE ARE IN AN AGE OF HIGH

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.538
EXPECTATIONS AND HIGH BELIEVES

00:52:54.604 --> 00:52:56.039
THAT OUR FOLKS TO BE VALUABLE

00:52:56.106 --> 00:52:57.474
AND CONTRIBUTING MEMBERS OF OUR

00:52:57.541 --> 00:52:59.910
SOCIETY. TO DO THAT THEY NEED TO

00:52:59.976 --> 00:53:01.978
BE ABLE TO BE TREATED IN THE

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.780
THIS BILL OR THIS THE WAY THIS

00:53:03.847 --> 00:53:05.282
IS BEING IMPLEMENTED.

00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:06.683
WE HAVE FOLKS WHO COULD GO AND

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.318
MEET OUR FOLKS AT BART RIDE WITH

00:53:08.385 --> 00:53:10.086
BART COME BACK THEN GO HOME FROM

00:53:10.153 --> 00:53:11.588
THAT VERSES COMING TO A LOCATION

00:53:11.655 --> 00:53:12.889
A CENTER.

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:13.757
WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM A FULL

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:14.558
PROGRAM DAY.

00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:16.159
THEY MADE US APART INDEPENDENTLY

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:17.527
THEY GO THEY DO THEIR ACTIVITIES

00:53:17.594 --> 00:53:18.161
THEY DO WHAT THEY WANNA DO THEY

00:53:18.228 --> 00:53:19.696
GO HOME.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:20.297
THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR HALF A

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:21.231
DAY.

00:53:21.298 --> 00:53:22.599
SO OUR STAFF PURSUE SUPPORTING

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.068
TO OTHER PEOPLE THAT ENTIRE TIME.

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.970
WE'VE LOST THAT REVENUE FOR THAT

00:53:27.037 --> 00:53:28.238
THAT THING IN OUR CASE IT'S

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:29.439
ABOUT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:30.807
MONTH WHICH IS ABOUT THE

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:32.108
EQUIVALENT THREE DIRECT SUPPORT

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:33.343
PROFESSIONALS.

00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:34.945
I CAN'T ELIMINATE.

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.646
A STAFF PERSON TO DO THAT

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:38.081
BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO FOLKS

00:53:38.148 --> 00:53:39.583
STILL NEED SUPPORT.

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:40.684
SO THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS YOU

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:41.985
KNOW BASICALLY WAY FOR THE STATE

00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:44.287
TO SAVE MONEY I WAS THERE IN TWO

00:53:44.354 --> 00:53:44.888
THOUSAND NINE AND TEN I WAS A

00:53:44.955 --> 00:53:46.256

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:47.757
TASKED WITH TRYING TO SAVE A

00:53:47.824 --> 00:53:48.692
WHOLE LOT OF MONEY.

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.860
AND WAS ALWAYS SO WE CAN DO THIS

00:53:50.927 --> 00:53:51.428
IN THAT SHORT TERM TEN YEARS

00:53:51.494 --> 00:53:52.429
LATER.

00:53:52.495 --> 00:53:53.763
HE GOT REIMPLEMENTED AND REALLY

00:53:53.830 --> 00:53:55.098
DOES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

00:53:55.165 --> 00:53:56.666
HOW FOLKS CAN REALLY BE AND

00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.735

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:00.804
WE HAVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.772
UNDER SYSTEM THAT'S DEPENDENT ON

00:54:02.839 --> 00:54:03.740

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.546

OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND IT

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.111
ALSO CREATES A CHILLING EFFECT.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.479
THAT WILL UNDERMINE ACCESS TO
