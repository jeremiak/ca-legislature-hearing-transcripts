CLIMATE ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.995
ON BEFORE I BEGIN I SHOULD JUST

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.131
PREFACE THIS WITH A NOTE THAT

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.565
OUR OFFICE DOES NOT TAKE A

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.934
POSITION ON BILLS SO MY COMMENTS

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.369
ARE MEANT TO BE.

BUT WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:24.444
THE BILL ITSELF.

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:25.078
ALL RIGHT THAT WITH THAT IF YOU

00:02:25.144 --> 00:02:25.678
TURN TO PAGE ONE OF YOUR HAND

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:26.379
OUT.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:27.447
AN ISSUE I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.515
THIS COMMITTEE ARE ALREADY VERY

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.183
FAMILIAR WITH THAT WHAT IS THE

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.384
CLIENT CLIMATE.

00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:33.019
SCIENCE TELLING US ABOUT THE

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.921
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF CLIMATE

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.223
CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA AND YOU CAN

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.658
SEE HERE ON THE FIRST TWO PAGES

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.361
A RANGE OF A FAX I'M GOING TO

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.062
EACH ONE BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.798
SEA LEVEL RISE ALONG THE COAST.

00:02:45.865 --> 00:02:47.233
INLAND FLOODING.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.768
INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE BOTH

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:51.905
OVERALL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AS

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:52.805
WELL AS HIGH HEAT EVENTS.

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:55.208
WE EXPECT TO SEE MORE AND MORE

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:58.077
SEVERE DROUGHTS IN THE FUTURE.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:58.912
THE CLIMATE SCIENTISTS ARE

00:02:58.978 --> 00:02:59.779
TELLING US THAT WE SHOULD SEE

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:02.882
MORE AND MORE SEVERE WILD FIRES

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:04.784
IN THE STATE.

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.386
AND ALSO WARMING MORE ACIDIC

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:09.322
OCEANS -- IMPORTANTLY EACH ONE

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:10.590
OF THOSE THE FAX.

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.226
COULD BE DRAMATIC FOR ANY

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.961
INDIVIDUAL REGION IN THE STATE --

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:15.828
BUT IMPORTANTLY IF YOU LOOK

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.330
ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE WE TO

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.132
EXPECT EVERY REGION TO IN ALL

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:20.600
LIKELIHOOD TO EXPERIENCE ONE IF

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:23.303
NOT MORE THAN ONE OF THOSE A FAX --

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.637
INNING CONSEQUENTLY WE WOULD

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:26.806
EXPECT TO SEE BASED ON THE

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.174
CLIMATE SCIENCE IS TELLING US.

00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.209
THAT THOSE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:32.478
COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.713
FOR THINGS LIKE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.315
THE HIGH HEAT EVENT FOR EXAMPLE

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.449
COULD HAVE.

00:03:36.516 --> 00:03:38.484
SIGNIFICANT BANKS ON AS ASTHMA

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:40.653
RATES AND AND INCREASED

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.888
MORTALITY.

00:03:41.955 --> 00:03:43.990
YOU COULD SEE A REDUCE WATER

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.358
SUPPLY BECAUSE OF DROUGHT.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:46.526
REDUCE WATER SUPPLY FOR

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.695
IRRIGATION IN OUR AGRICULTURAL

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:49.996
REGIONS.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.397
YOU COULD SEE PUBLIC SAFETY

00:03:51.464 --> 00:03:54.901
IMPACT BECAUSE OF EVENTS LIKE

00:03:54.968 --> 00:03:56.736
FLOODING IN WILD FIRES.

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:57.637
IF YOU TURN TO PAGE THREE OF THE

00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.205
HAND NOW -- SO ONE OF THE

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:00.807
QUESTIONS WERE SOMETIMES ASK AND

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:03.076
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE ECONOMIC

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:04.477
AND FISCAL A FAX.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:06.279
OF THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:08.081
IN THE FUTURE IN IN THE SHORT

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.749
ANSWER WE DON'T KNOW A LOT YET --

00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.250
THERE ARE THERE IS SOME RESEARCH

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.952
OUT THEN WE TRY TO SUMMARIZE A

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:13.586
LITTLE BIT OF THAT HERE IN THE

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:14.354
HAND OUT.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.655
BUT WITH REGARD TO LONGER TERM

00:04:15.722 --> 00:04:17.190
ECONOMIC IMPACT PROBABLY THE

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:19.492
BEST STUDY THAT WE'VE COME

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.994
ACROSS SO FAR.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.762
DONE BY A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:24.597
AND INCLUDING SOME FROM OUR OWN

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.299
UC BERKELEY.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.267
AND THEY LOOK NATION WIDE AT

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.269
CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:32.472
CLIMATE CHANGE AND TRY TO FIGURE

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:33.573
OUT WHAT WOULD THAT AFFECT ON

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.841
GDP BE.

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:36.909
IN DIFFERENT AREAS BASED ON WHAT

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.012
THE THE FACTS WOULD BE -- BASED

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.047
ON THEIR RESEARCH THEY WOULD AS

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:41.981
WE WOULD SORT OF PUT ON THE

00:04:42.048 --> 00:04:43.516
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF TENS OF

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.351
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN LOST CDP

00:04:45.418 --> 00:04:48.354
IN CALIFORNIA ON AN ANNUAL BASIS --

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.124
OUT IN -- TWENTY ONE HUNDRED

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.725
TAKE THAT WITH -- AS SORT OF AN

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:53.693
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE THERE'S A

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.961
CERTAINLY A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.063
AROUND THAT IN THE AUTHOR'S NOTE

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.131
TO THAT ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS

00:04:58.197 --> 00:04:59.932
OF THEIR STUDY IS THEY COULD

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.234
LOOK AT THE FULL RANGE OF

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.169
IMPACTS OF OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.303
SO THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.105
CALIFORNIA BECAUSE A COUPLE.

00:05:06.172 --> 00:05:07.206
OF PIECES THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

00:05:07.273 --> 00:05:08.708
INCLUDE WERE THE EFFECTS OF WILD

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:10.810
FIRE WHICH WE KNOW CALIFORNIA

00:05:10.877 --> 00:05:13.212
COURSE HAS VERY SEVERE RISKS.

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.781
AS WELL AS SEALEVEL RISE THEY

00:05:14.847 --> 00:05:15.782
LOOK AT SEA LEVEL RISE THAT

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.283
SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.619
HURRICANES -- I THINK THE THAT

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:20.520
WE EXPECT THE AFFECTION

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.055
CALIFORNIA SEA LEVEL RISE TO BE

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.790
SIGNIFICANT BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.291
RELATED TO HURRICANES.

00:05:25.358 --> 00:05:26.859
AND SO JUST -- ADDED HERE JUST

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:28.728
VERY RECENTLY LAST COUPLE WEEKS

00:05:28.795 --> 00:05:30.096
THE USGS.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.397
LOOK AT WHAT ALONG THE

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:32.799
CALIFORNIA COAST IS ESTIMATED

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.268
THE PROPERTY VALUE AT RISK FROM

00:05:35.334 --> 00:05:36.869
EVEN MODERATE SEA LEVEL RISE

00:05:36.936 --> 00:05:38.404
OVER THE NEXT EIGHTY YEARS AND

00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:39.739
THEY PUT IT AT A HUNDRED FIFTY

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:41.040
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:05:41.107 --> 00:05:43.076
OF VALUE -- ISN'T.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:44.210
BUT NO THAT'S NOT THE AMOUNT

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:46.179
THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BEING

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:47.914
LOST NECESSARILY BUT THAT'S THE

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.182
AMOUNT OF RISK AND AGAIN TO GIVE

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:49.348
YOU.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:50.550
AT LEAST A POINT.

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:53.953
ON ORDER OF MAGNITUDE OF

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.021
POTENTIAL RISK.

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:55.655
BUT THAT'S THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:56.723
SOMETIMES WHAT WERE ASKED WHAT

00:05:56.789 --> 00:05:57.757
WHAT'S THE RISK TO STATE AND

00:05:57.824 --> 00:05:59.692
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHAT TO OUR

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.494
FINANCES.

00:06:01.561 --> 00:06:02.595
AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD

00:06:02.662 --> 00:06:04.997
COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THIS --

00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:06.499
WE'VE DONE SOME LOOKING AND AND

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.968
WE WERE ABLE TO COME ACROSS GOOD

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.536
INFORMATION ON THAT.

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:12.038
THAT SAID WE DO KNOW THAT THE

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:13.639
TYPES OF IMPACTS WE'VE SORTOF

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.007
CATEGORIZED.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:16.075
IN THREE WAYS FIRST OF ALL YOU

00:06:16.142 --> 00:06:17.043
WOULD EXPECT THAT STATE AND

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.544
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:20.346
INCREASED THE COST TO RESPOND TO

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:22.115
DISASTERS LIKE FLOODS.

00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.717
AND WILDFIRES. TO THE EXTENT

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:27.086
THAT CLIMATE CHANGE CONTINUE

00:06:27.153 --> 00:06:27.720
THEN HAS THE THE FACTS THAT ARE

00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:29.555
PROJECTED YOU WOULD EXPECT TO

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.758
SEE INCREASED COSTS FOR DISASTER

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.459
RESPONSE AND RECOVERY.

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:35.161
JUST TO GIVE YOU ONE POINT OF OF

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.830
REFERENCE THE CAMPFIRE THIS LAST

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.232
YEAR THE STATE.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.266
IS BUDGETING THREE BILLION

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.400
DOLLARS FOR RESPONSE AND

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.569
RECOVERY COSTS JUST FOR THAT ONE

00:06:43.636 --> 00:06:44.637
EVENT ALONE.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:45.671
WORTH NOTING OF COURSE THAT THE

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:46.305
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:47.440
REIMBURSE US FOR A LARGE SHARE

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:49.075
THAT COST BUT GIVE YOU AGAIN

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.077
IT'S NOT AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.612
FROM AS A SINGLE EVENT.

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:54.046
WE ALSO EXPECT TO SEE ANNUAL

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:55.915
OPERATING COSTS GO UP IN THE

00:06:55.982 --> 00:06:57.150
FUTURE FOR STATE LOCAL

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.985
GOVERNMENTS. FOR PREVENTIVE

00:06:59.051 --> 00:07:00.720
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS WELFARE

00:07:00.787 --> 00:07:02.655
PREVENTION OR FLOOD MAINTENANCE

00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:05.324
AND IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES --

00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:06.926
THAT MIGHT MEAN NEED TO BE DONE

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.128
ON A ROUTINE BASIS COULD SEE

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:09.962
INCREASE IN ENERGY COSTS AND

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.431
OTHER ONGOING OPERATING COSTS.

00:07:12.498 --> 00:07:13.566
AND LASTLY WE MIGHT EXPECT TO

00:07:13.633 --> 00:07:15.668
SEE ONE TIME OUT LAYS FROM STATE

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.837
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HARDEN

00:07:17.904 --> 00:07:19.305
FACILITIES OR IN SOME CASES

00:07:19.372 --> 00:07:21.507
RELOCATE FACILITIES IN ORDER TO

00:07:21.574 --> 00:07:23.176
TAKE THEM OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE.

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:24.644
YOU KNOW FROM SEA LEVEL RISE OR

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.747
WILD FIRES OR OTHER POTENTIAL --

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:30.049
RISKY AREAS -- IF YOU TURN THE

00:07:30.116 --> 00:07:32.018
PAGE FOR A MINUTE CHANGE GEARS

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:33.586
AND TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:07:33.653 --> 00:07:35.254
STATE BONDS.

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:36.322
THE STATE.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:37.723
CAN I TAKE PAYS FOR

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.025
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN TWO

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.560
WAYS WE DO SOME ON A PAY AS YOU

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.195
GO BASIS WE DON'T DO A LOT OF

00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:43.129
THAT WITH THE GENERAL FUND

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.697
THAT'S FAIRLY LIMITED

00:07:44.764 --> 00:07:46.666
HISTORICALLY.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:50.469
WHAT WE DO ISSUE BONDS AND -- WE

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:51.604
HAVE TO TYPE THE BOND IN THE

00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:53.773
STATE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.473
OF THE ONE TO HAVE TO GO TO

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.676
VOTERS STATE WIDE VOTERS WE ALSO

00:07:56.742 --> 00:07:58.878
HAVE SOME USE OF LEASE REVENUE

00:07:58.945 --> 00:08:00.546
BONDS.

00:08:00.613 --> 00:08:03.349
BONDS YOU CAN THINK OF IS JUST A

00:08:03.416 --> 00:08:04.050
WAY TO BORROW MONEY ITS.

00:08:04.116 --> 00:08:05.585
WE ISSUE THE BONDS PRIVATE

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.020
INVESTORS PROVIDE US MONEY WE

00:08:08.087 --> 00:08:08.888
USE THAT MONEY TO PAY FOR

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:10.389
PROJECTS AND THEN WE HAVE TO

00:08:10.456 --> 00:08:12.158
REPAY THOSE INVESTORS OVER A

00:08:12.225 --> 00:08:13.759
PERIOD OF YEARS OFTENTIMES

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.761
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS. FOR

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.063
INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:19.198
MUCH LIKE THE WAY WE PAY FOR OUR

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.766
HOUSE WITH AND PAY FOR MORTGAGE

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:21.934
FOR A HOUSE WE BORROWED HAVE TO

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.870
PAY IT BACK WITH INTEREST OVER

00:08:23.936 --> 00:08:24.737
TIME.

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.472
WE DO THIS SO FOR A COUPLE OF OF

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.241
GOOD REASONS -- WE KNOW THE

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:28.875
OFTENTIMES THESE LARGE

00:08:28.941 --> 00:08:30.343
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS CAN BE

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:31.911
DIFFICULT TO PAY FOR ON A PAGE

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.512
YOU GO BASIS BECAUSE OF THE

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:35.414
MAGNITUDE OF COSTS -- AGAIN

00:08:35.481 --> 00:08:37.483
PARTICULAR LARGE PROJECTS.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.885
AND ALSO THERE'S SOME.

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:41.220
VALUE IN THESE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:08:41.287 --> 00:08:42.421
PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE

00:08:42.488 --> 00:08:44.524
A LONGER LIFESPAN FOR TAXPAYERS

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.492
OF FEE PAYERS NOT ONLY TODAY BUT

00:08:46.559 --> 00:08:48.094
THOSE IN THE FUTURE TO

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.295
CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF THOSE

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:51.364
PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'LL BENEFIT

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.966
FROM THEM AS WELL -- WHICH

00:08:54.033 --> 00:08:55.835
SOMETIMES ASK WHAT WAS THE COST

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.703
OF FINANCING WITH THE BOND -- IN

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.006
NOMINAL DOLLARS IT'S USUALLY WE

00:09:00.072 --> 00:09:01.240
ULTIMATELY WILL PAY WITH THOSE

00:09:01.307 --> 00:09:03.075
INTEREST COST ABOUT TWO DOLLARS

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.343
FOR EVERY DOLLAR IN BOND

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.444
ISSUANCE.

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:06.779
BUT WHEN WE COUNT FOR THE FACT

00:09:06.846 --> 00:09:08.781
THAT WE PAY THOSE COSTS OFF OVER

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.349
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR PERIOD

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.118
WHEN YOU COUNT FOR INFLATION IT

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:13.819
TEND TO BE MORE LIKE A DOLLAR

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:15.988
AND THIRTY CENTS AN ACTUAL REAL

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.690
DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING. FOR

00:09:17.757 --> 00:09:20.126
EACH DOLLAR ISSUED SO THERE ARE

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:21.794
INCREASE COSTS BUT SOMETIMES

00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:23.362
THERE'S SOME CONFUSION ABOUT

00:09:23.429 --> 00:09:25.531
JUST WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE SO FOR

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.198
THAT SO FULL.

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:28.434
YOU TURN TO PAGE FIVE JUST THIS

00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.003
JUST SUMMARIZE IT FOR YOU THE A

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.438
NATURAL RESOURCES RELATED BONDS

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:34.440
AND BEEN ISSUED OVER THE PAST

00:09:34.507 --> 00:09:35.541
TWO DECADES.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:37.143
THE TOTAL ABOUT THIRTY ONE

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:39.378
BILLION DOLLARS IN.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.047
TOTAL BOND AUTHORITY.

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:43.449
MOST OF THIS MONEY HAS ALREADY

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:45.818
BEEN COMMITTED TO PROJECTS AND

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:47.720
SPENT PROBABLY THE TWO

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:49.889
EXCEPTIONS OR THE LAST.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:51.223
TWO PROPOSITION ONE WHICH IS THE

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.426
FAMILIAR WATER RELATED BOND

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.195
PASSED IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN NOT

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:56.796
ALL THAT MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT%

00:09:56.862 --> 00:09:58.731
YET -- BUT MOST OF IT HAD BEEN

00:09:58.798 --> 00:10:00.366
COMMITTED TO TO PROJECTS SO

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.635
THERE ARE PROJECTS UNDER WAY AND

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:03.903
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT AND

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:05.304
CONSTRUCTION PHASES.

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.573
AND WITH PROP PROPOSITION SIXTY

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.240
EIGHT WITH PAST LESS THAN A YEAR

00:10:08.307 --> 00:10:10.343
AGO BUT ALREADY BETWEEN THE

00:10:10.409 --> 00:10:11.644
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET AND WITH

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:13.279
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR THE

00:10:13.346 --> 00:10:15.581
BUDGET YEAR IF APPROVED BY YOU

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.783
ALSO THAT WILL HAVE AUTHORIZED

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:18.718
OR APPROPRIATED.

00:10:18.784 --> 00:10:20.286
ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL FOR

00:10:20.353 --> 00:10:21.821
BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:24.757
AUTHORIZED HIM OUT BONTA THAT

00:10:24.824 --> 00:10:26.158
ONE IS ALSO WELL ANYWAY.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:28.294
AND IF YOU TURN TO PAGE SIX JUST

00:10:28.361 --> 00:10:28.794
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STATE

00:10:28.861 --> 00:10:30.763
INDEBTEDNESS.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:31.998
THE FIGURE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.266
PAGE SHOWS OVER THE LAST COUPLE

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:37.169
OF DECADES WHAT SHARE.

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.971
OF STATE GENERAL FUND REVENUES

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:40.840
ARE SPENT ON PAYING OFF OUR

00:10:40.906 --> 00:10:42.842
GENERAL FUND BOND MOSTLY GENERAL

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.377
OBLIGATION BOND AGAIN.

00:10:44.443 --> 00:10:45.511
AND YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.580
TO A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN 5% OF

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.181
OUR OVERALL GENERAL FUND IS

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:50.816
SPENT FOR THAT PURPOSE -- AND

00:10:50.883 --> 00:10:52.084
YOU CAN SEE THAT FALLS KIND OF

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:54.353
IN A RANGE A NORMAL RANGE OVER

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.155
THE LAST COUPLE OF DECADES.

00:10:56.222 --> 00:10:57.790
THIS VARIATION USING THE FIGURE

00:10:57.857 --> 00:10:59.392
IS NOT REALLY DRIVEN PRIMARILY

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:01.327
BY CHANGES IN HOW MUCH BOND

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.095
ISSUE IT ISSUED ON AN ANNUAL

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:05.731
BASIS AS MUCH AS IS AFFECTED BY.

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.066
GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN THE

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.268
VOLATILITY OF OUR REVENUE STREAM

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:10.903
IN THE STATE AND SO IS.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:12.405
GENERAL FUND REVENUES GO UP ARE

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:14.240
THE PERCENTAGE SPENT ON BOND

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:16.075
ISSUANCES DECLINES AND AND VICE

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:18.477
VERSA -- I KNOW THAT A ROUGHLY

00:11:18.544 --> 00:11:20.046
ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.180
ANNUALLY IT'S BEEN OUT OF THE

00:11:21.247 --> 00:11:22.581
GENERAL FUND TO PAY OFF

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:25.217
RESOURCES RELATED BONDS.

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:27.186
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ISSUED.

00:11:27.253 --> 00:11:29.321
ON PAGE -- SEVEN THESE ARE A

00:11:29.388 --> 00:11:31.023
COUPLE OF CONSIDERATIONS WHEN

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.892
DESIGNING BONDS THESE COME FROM

00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:34.493
VARIOUS DOCUMENTS OUR OFFICE IS

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.594
PRODUCED.

00:11:35.661 --> 00:11:37.463
IN PRIOR YEARS RELATED TO TO

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.665
VERY SMALL AND MEASURES.

00:11:39.732 --> 00:11:40.966
FIRST WE JUST HIGHLIGHTED

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:42.468
THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT LEVEL OF

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.570
SPENDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE OR

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:45.971
BOND AT IT.

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.174
LIKE EVERY OTHER BUDGET PROGRAM

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.942
YOU HAVE IT'S REALLY A FOR

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:51.510
REFLECTION OF HOW.

00:11:51.577 --> 00:11:53.245
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE FALLS WITHIN

00:11:53.312 --> 00:11:54.680
YOUR PRIORITIES FOR GENERAL FUND

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.515
SPENDING BECAUSE OF COURSE EVERY

00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.283
DOLLAR THAT YOU SPEND ON

00:11:57.349 --> 00:11:58.884
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT AVAILABLE

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:00.953
FOR OTHER PROGRAMS -- ONE THING

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.456
THAT MAKES SPENDING ON BOND A

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:04.090
LITTLE BIT UNIQUE OF COURSE IS

00:12:04.156 --> 00:12:04.957
THAT.

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:06.392
BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING THAT TWENTY

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:07.560
OR THIRTY YEAR COMMITMENT TO PAY

00:12:07.626 --> 00:12:09.195
OFF THOSE BONDS YOU'RE NOT JUST

00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.830
MAKING A ONE YEAR COMMITMENT FOR

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.665
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU ARE YOU

00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:13.999
SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:15.668
THOSE COSTS ARE GONNA BE IN THE

00:12:15.734 --> 00:12:16.836
BUDGET.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:18.404
AND THEREFORE NOT AVAILABLE FOR

00:12:18.471 --> 00:12:19.238
OTHER PURPOSES FOR A LONGER

00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:20.239
PERIOD THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S

00:12:20.306 --> 00:12:21.607
NOT WORTH DOING BUT YOU JUST

00:12:21.674 --> 00:12:22.942
WANNA RECOGNIZE THAT AS YOU'RE

00:12:23.008 --> 00:12:26.145
THINKING ABOUT YOUR LONGER TERM.

00:12:26.212 --> 00:12:27.613
PRIORITIES.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.514
ON THE SECOND.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.216
WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE THESE BONDS

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:32.351
ARE PAID OFF OVER LONG PERIODS

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:33.319
IMPORTANT WE THINK.

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:35.087
TO A TARGET BONDS TO PROJECT

00:12:35.154 --> 00:12:36.589
THAT WILL HAVE A LONGER LIFESPAN

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:38.324
WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOMMEND

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:40.593

MOST PART.

00:12:45.731 --> 00:12:47.333
FROM ONE CONSIDERATION YOU'LL

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:49.235
ALSO HAVE IS HOW MUCH OF A YOUR

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.170
BOND SHOULD BE SPENT ON STATE

00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:53.105
VERSUS LOCAL PROJECTS THERE'S NO

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:55.141
RIGHT OR WRONG SPLIT TO THIS BUT

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:56.442
CERTAINLY IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.743
THE STATE TO USE BOND FOR STATE

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.712
PROJECTS EITHER INFRASTRUCTURE

00:12:59.778 --> 00:13:01.413
THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE. TO

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:03.716
PROVIDE SERVICES TO CALIFORNIANS --

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.550
SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE DEBATE

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.152
ABOUT HOW THEY SHOULD BE HOW

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:07.620
MUCH OF BOND SHOULD BE TARGETED

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.655
TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE LOCAL

00:13:09.722 --> 00:13:11.790
PROJECTS -- HISTORICALLY AS A

00:13:11.857 --> 00:13:13.325
STAY AREN'T RESOURCES BONDS HAVE

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:14.693

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:17.730
TOWARDS COMMUNITIES OTHERWISE

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.165
DON'T HAVE SUFFICIENT.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:21.901
RESOURCES TO PAY FOR PROJECTS ON

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:22.668
THEIR OWN.

00:13:22.735 --> 00:13:24.170
OR JUST OTHER HIGH PRIORITY

00:13:24.236 --> 00:13:25.437
NEEDS OR SOMETIMES REGIONAL

PROJECTS -- PROJECTS WHERE THERE

00:13:27.273 --> 00:13:29.508
MAY NOT BE LOCAL INCENTIVE. FOR

00:13:29.575 --> 00:13:30.910
LOCAL COLLABORATION SOMETIMES WE

00:13:30.976 --> 00:13:33.512
CAN USE OUR BOND FUNDS OR OTHER

00:13:33.579 --> 00:13:36.215
REVENUE STREAMS TO HELP.

00:13:36.282 --> 00:13:37.616
ENCOURAGE THAT KIND OF ACTIVITY.

00:13:37.683 --> 00:13:38.684
YOU ALSO WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.019
YOU DISTRIBUTE THE BOND WITH THE

00:13:40.085 --> 00:13:41.587
ONE YOU THE COMPETITIVE PROCESS

00:13:41.654 --> 00:13:42.955
OR FORMULA.

00:13:43.022 --> 00:13:43.722
PROSELYTE THAT MAY JUST DEPEND

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:46.158
ON EACH INDIVIDUAL BOND PROGRAM

00:13:46.225 --> 00:13:46.892
WHAT.

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:48.127
WELL WHAT YOU WANT ENCOURAGE

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:49.929
WHETHER CERTAIN SPECIFIC GOALS

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.630
THAT YOU WANT TO TRY TO ACHIEVE

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.998
IN WHICH CASE MAYBE COMPETITIVE

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.300
PROCESS IS.

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.335
MORE VALUABLE OR IF YOU REALLY

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.103
ARE YOUR GOAL IS TO SPREAD --

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.940
CERTAIN FINDING EQUALLY ACROSS

00:14:01.006 --> 00:14:01.540
THE STATE AND YOU MIGHT USE A

00:14:01.607 --> 00:14:04.843
FORMULA -- WE ALSO THINK IT'S

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.945
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT.

00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:07.112
OF PRETTY GOOD FOR PROJECTS TO

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.581
GO TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:14:08.647 --> 00:14:10.082
LOCAL NONPROFITS THAT THEY HAVE

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:11.717
A PLAN IN PLACE TO MAINTAIN THAT

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.118
INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE LONGER

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:14.386
TERM FOR THAT THEY DON'T.

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.989
BECOME DILAPIDATED -- BEFORE

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:18.424
THEIR USEFUL LIFE SHOULD AND AND

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.760
LASTLY RESOURCES BONDS IN RECENT

00:14:21.827 --> 00:14:23.128
YEARS HAVE.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.897
INCLUDED PROVISIONS REQUIRING

00:14:24.964 --> 00:14:27.199
ACCOUNTABILITY AND REPORTING OF

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:28.434
PROJECT WE THINK THAT'S VERY

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.002
IMPORTANT. TO ENSURE THAT.

00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:32.304
YOU KNOW AND CAN DO YOUR

00:14:32.371 --> 00:14:32.905
OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT YOU

00:14:32.972 --> 00:14:33.706
KNOW WHAT.

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:34.773
WHAT PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.674
IMPLEMENTED HOW THEY'VE BEEN

00:14:35.741 --> 00:14:37.610
IMPLEMENTED ON WHAT TIME FRAME

00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.245
IT ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION FOR

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.312
FUTURE?

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.314
DELIBERATIONS FOR FUTURE BOND

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:42.948
YOU CAN LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT

00:14:43.015 --> 00:14:44.183
WHAT DID.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.252
THAT BOND ACCOMPLISH DO WE NEED

00:14:46.318 --> 00:14:47.786
TO MAYBE MAKE ANY CHANGES IN TO

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:49.288
A FUTURE BOND BASED ON LESSONS

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:51.323
LEARNED.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.591
FROM WHAT'S REPORTED HERE.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:53.726
THERE'S A JUST GENERAL GENERAL

00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:55.928
KNOW SOMEONE IN GENERAL LAST

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.997
LAST TWO PAGES DAM PAGE EIGHT

00:14:58.063 --> 00:14:58.797
I'M.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:01.233
HERE WE WERE ASKED WHAT OTHER.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.035
REVENUE SOURCES ARE FUNDING

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:06.739
SOURCES COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE.

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:07.172
FOR CLIMB ADAPTATION

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:07.473
[inaudible]

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:08.807
JACK'S.

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:10.142
WE KIND OF CATEGORIZES INTO A

00:15:10.209 --> 00:15:11.310
YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR EXISTING

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:12.878
REVENUES THAT YOU HAVE AVAILABLE

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:14.513
DIFFERENT POTS AND AND THE

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.281
FORTIES.

00:15:15.347 --> 00:15:16.115
AND THEN OF COURSE YOU ARE A YOU

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:17.216
AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

00:15:17.283 --> 00:15:19.685
AUTHORITY O RAISE NEW REVENUES.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:20.886
THE FIRST WITH RESPECT TO

00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.222
EXISTING REVENUE SOURCES -- I

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.823
THINK THE KEY THING HERE AGAIN

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.258
IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT.

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.227
YOU YOU CAN USE ALMOST ANY OF

00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:30.229
THESE BUT TO EXTENT THERE IS THE

00:15:30.296 --> 00:15:31.563
OPPORTUNITY COST TO TO EXTEND TO

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.931
YOU THAT FOR ONE PURPOSE IS NOT

00:15:32.998 --> 00:15:35.267
AVAILABLE FOR FOR ANOTHER FOR

00:15:35.334 --> 00:15:35.534
ANOTHER.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.303
BUDGET PRIORITY BUT CERTAINLY

00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:38.337
STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:39.772
pGENERAL FUND THERE ARE MANY

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.508
SPECIAL FUNDS THAT CAN BE USED

00:15:42.574 --> 00:15:43.942
FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS

00:15:44.009 --> 00:15:45.678
FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE IS YOU THE

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.680
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND ON

00:15:47.746 --> 00:15:49.148
A LIMITED BASIS.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:50.749
FOR ADAPTATION SPECIFIC RELATED

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:54.219
PROJECTS -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:15:54.286 --> 00:15:55.721
FOR EXAMPLE COULD HAVE SOME FEES

00:15:55.788 --> 00:15:57.222
WHILE WATER RELATED FEEDER FLOOD

00:15:57.289 --> 00:15:59.191
PROTECTION FEE THAT COULD BE

00:15:59.258 --> 00:15:59.758
USED FOR PROJECTS THAT COULD

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.293
HELP.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.729
CLIMATE CHANGE RISK FOR EXAMPLE.

00:16:03.796 --> 00:16:04.730
LOCAL.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.831
IN ADDITION TO STATE THE LOCALS

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:08.200
ALSO HAVE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:09.601
BONDS.

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.337
IN ONE SPECIFIC BOND AUTHORITY

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:12.671
IS THE ENHANCED INFRASTRUCTURE

THE LEGISLATURE JUST A FEW YEARS

00:16:17.843 --> 00:16:20.245
AGO IN THE AFTERMATH OF A

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:21.947
DISSOLUTION OF REDEVELOPMENT.

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:23.882
IN THIS ALLOWS CITIES COUNTIES

GOVERNMENTS.

00:16:44.403 --> 00:16:45.771
IN LESS THAN ONE HIGHLIGHTED THE

00:16:45.838 --> 00:16:46.972
STATE DOES IN IN LOCAL

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.540
GOVERNMENTS THAT IS WELL

RECEIVED FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S

00:16:50.109 --> 00:16:51.810
RELATIVELY SMALL FOR THE MOST

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:52.811
PART.

00:16:52.878 --> 00:16:54.613
OFTEN FOR PLANNING AND RESEARCH

SOMETHING THAT WE HIGHLIGHTED IN

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.526
OUR BUDGET ANALYSIS THIS HERE.

00:17:07.593 --> 00:17:08.827
THIS IS FUNDING THAT COMES TO

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:11.029
STATE IN THE AFTERMATH FROM FEMA

00:17:11.096 --> 00:17:13.165
IN THE AFTERMATH OF LARGE

00:17:13.232 --> 00:17:14.533
DISASTERS AND BECAUSE

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.701
CALIFORNIA'S HAVE THE VERY LARGE

YEARS.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:19.238
WE'RE ANTICIPATING THE STATE

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:20.406
WILL RECEIVE ABOUT A BILLION

00:17:20.472 --> 00:17:22.574

MANAGE THAT PROGRAM AND THEY SET

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.750

BE -- FOR WILL BE FUNDED AND

00:17:33.452 --> 00:17:34.920
CERTAIN CLIMATE ADAPTATION TYPE

OF ACTIVITIES ARE ALLOWABLE USES

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.791
OF THOSE FUNDS WE'VE RECOMMENDED

THAT THEIR PRIORITIES ARE.

00:17:44.329 --> 00:17:45.664
IN SOME CASES DIFFER FROM YOURS

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:47.332
THAT PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL

LASTLY ON PAGE -- NINE AGAIN IS

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:54.840

STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

00:17:57.376 --> 00:17:59.144
AUTHORITY TO RAISE REVENUES --

00:17:59.211 --> 00:18:00.779
THAT CAN BE BROAD BASED TAX

AGAIN AS I'M SURE THE COMMITTEE

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.955
MEMBERS ARE WELL AWARE -- BUT

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:10.756
WHETHER THOSE BE DIFFERENT

VOTE ON CERTAIN FEES ARE

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.466
ASSESSMENTS -- WE JUST HIGHLIGHT

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.935
HERE THAT -- THESE ARE AVENUES

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.404
THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND COULD BE

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:26.638
USED FOR CLIMATE ADAPTATION

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:28.273
PROJECT BUT AGAIN THERE ARE

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.875
CERTAIN CONSTRAINTS ON THOSE

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:30.843
WHETHER THOSE BE LIMITATIONS

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:33.011
LIKE I'M PROP THIRTEEN FROM PROP

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:49.127
QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE.

00:18:49.194 --> 00:18:52.598
THANK YOU -- THE CONCISE BUT

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:55.634
VERY USEFUL TESTIMONY -- I I

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.703
JUST TO START OVER THE ONE IN.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.705
LINE OF QUESTIONS JUST IN TERMS

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:02.674
OF THE THE MATH AROUND COST

00:19:02.741 --> 00:19:03.609
EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDRESSING

00:19:03.675 --> 00:19:05.077
CLIMATE CHANGE [inaudible]

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:09.781
AND WE WE ROLLED BY THE NUMBER

00:19:09.848 --> 00:19:13.752
BUT IT'S A REALLY BIG.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:15.454
ONE WE'RE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TENS

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.755
OF BILLIONS [inaudible]

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:20.058
AND SOME OTHER UNKNOWN UPPER

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:22.427
BOUND -- I'M REALLY HOPING OUR

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:23.962
FIFTH CLIMATE ASSESSMENT IN THE

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:25.397
STATE STARTS.

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:26.899
TO DRILL DOWN ON THE TRUE FISCAL

00:19:26.965 --> 00:19:30.969
RISK BUT I GUESS I WAS WONDERING

00:19:31.036 --> 00:19:31.270
[inaudible]

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:34.740
THE IT'S ABOUT A BUCK THIRTY FOR

00:19:34.806 --> 00:19:36.508
EACH DOLLAR PART OF THESE BONDS

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:37.109
THIS IS SORT OF ROUGH WORKING

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:38.377
MATH.

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:41.013
BUT IF THE COST OF CLIMATE

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:43.382
CHANGE IS A A TRILLION DOLLARS

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:44.283
BY THE END OF THE CENTURY

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:44.583
[inaudible]

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.952
I'M.

00:19:47.019 --> 00:19:49.187
HOW DOES THAT AFFECT?

00:19:49.254 --> 00:19:50.722
THEY ARE MATH WE MAKE EVEN JUST

00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:52.457
CERTAIN PRESUMPTIONS IN THE LIFE

00:19:52.524 --> 00:19:54.226
OF THE BOND STATE YOU KNOW

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:56.428
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEAR BASIS --

00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.096
HOW DOES THAT SORT OF AVOIDED

00:19:58.163 --> 00:20:00.666
COST AFFECT?

00:20:00.732 --> 00:20:02.568
THAT MATH AROUND BUCK THIRTY PER

00:20:02.634 --> 00:20:04.636
DOLLAR.

00:20:04.703 --> 00:20:06.672
YEAH I MICHIGAN TO THE ATH IN

00:20:06.738 --> 00:20:08.073
MY HEAD BUT I THINK -- I THINK

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:09.508
AND SEXUALLY IF I UNDERSTAND

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:11.843
YOUR QUESTION I I THINK YOU'RE

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.412
ASKING A QUESTION WHICH IS.

00:20:13.478 --> 00:20:14.446
KEY CENTER WE MAKE THESE

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:15.814
INVESTMENTS TODAY EVEN IF THERE

00:20:15.881 --> 00:20:17.215
ARE ADDITIONAL.

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:19.985
IN INFLATION OR I'M SORRY.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.720
INTEREST RELATED COSTS.

00:20:21.787 --> 00:20:22.921
COULD SPENDING THOSE DOLLARS

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.924
TODAY REDUCE FUTURE COSTS AND

00:20:25.991 --> 00:20:27.426
AND AND THE MATH WORK OUT THAT

00:20:27.492 --> 00:20:28.961
THAT'S A BETTER INVESTMENT TODAY

00:20:29.027 --> 00:20:30.495
THAN THAN WAITING FOR THOSE

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:32.664
DISASTERS OR FUTURE COSTS MATURE

00:20:32.731 --> 00:20:34.032
THAT AND I THINK CONCEPTUALLY

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.301
THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT --

00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:38.203
WE OFTENTIMES THINK ABOUT EVEN

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.805
JUST IN OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM

00:20:39.871 --> 00:20:41.540
FOR STATE INFRASTRUCTURE WE'RE

00:20:41.607 --> 00:20:43.675
REGULATE ADVISING YOU IN THE

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.243
ADMINISTRATION TO PUT MORE MONEY

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:47.946
INTO PREVENTIVE ACTIVITIES TO

00:20:48.013 --> 00:20:49.448
ENSURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:20:49.514 --> 00:20:51.950
IS NOT DAMAGE IN THE FUTURE

00:20:52.017 --> 00:20:52.951
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT.

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:55.120
THERE ARE SO MANY EXAMPLES WHERE

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.756
IF WE WAIT FOR A FACILITY TO BE

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:59.257
DAMAGE THE COSTS ARE MUCH

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:02.427
GREATER. TO REPAIR OR REPLACE

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:04.463
THAT FACILITY AND TO DO THE WORK

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:06.798
UP FRONT NOW I GET SOMEWHAT

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:09.234
COMPLICATED BECAUSE THIS IS

00:21:09.301 --> 00:21:11.236
SOMEWHAT CONCEPTUAL WHAT.

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:13.639
WHAT THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS WOULD

00:21:13.705 --> 00:21:17.142
BE RIGHT -- IF WE THINK ABOUT.

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:19.745
SEA LEVEL RISE FOR EXAMPLE.

00:21:19.811 --> 00:21:20.479
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:22.648
ABOUT OR IN IN PROBABLY VERY

00:21:22.714 --> 00:21:23.915
FROM COMMUNITY COMMUNITY ABOUT

00:21:23.982 --> 00:21:25.517
WHAT THE RIGHT STRATEGY SHOULD

00:21:25.584 --> 00:21:27.019
BE BASED ON WHAT THEIR LOCAL

00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.354
RISKS ARE FROM SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.156
AND WEATHER MAKES SENSE. FOR

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:32.624
CERTAIN FOR CERTAIN PROJECT TO

00:21:32.691 --> 00:21:34.359
DO HARDENING TYPE PROJECTS OR TO

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:36.228
DO PROJECTS.

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:36.862
WHICH HAVE COME WITH ONE SET OF

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.797
COST TO DO OTHER PROJECTS THAT

00:21:38.864 --> 00:21:41.767
MIGHT MAKE THEM IN SOME WAYS --

00:21:41.833 --> 00:21:44.603
JUST MORE ABLE TO WITHSTAND.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.405
SEA LEVEL RISE TO MAYBE RAISING

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.740
OF A BUILDING FOR EXAMPLE THAT

00:21:48.807 --> 00:21:49.374
COULD COME WITH A DIFFERENT SET

00:21:49.441 --> 00:21:50.976
OF COST WHICH IS ACTUALLY HAVING

00:21:51.043 --> 00:21:51.910
TO MOVE.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.578
THE SALIENT SO THERE'S BEEN TALK

00:21:53.645 --> 00:21:54.813
FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT.

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.048
CERTAIN FREEWAYS ARE CERTAIN

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:57.182
ROADS ACTUALLY HAVING TO BE

00:21:57.249 --> 00:21:58.817
REDIRECTED IN DIFFERENT PLACES

00:21:58.884 --> 00:22:00.719
BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF A

00:22:00.786 --> 00:22:02.454
ROTATION ALONG THE COAST.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.422
THAT COMES WITH A DIFFERENT SET

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.323
OF COST AND SO IT TO DO THE MATH

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:06.858
I THINK EARLIER IN SOME WAYS

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:08.060
REQUIRES REALLY LOOKING AT THIS.

00:22:08.126 --> 00:22:09.594
SPECIFIC PROJECT A PROGRAM IN

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.329
FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE FUTURE

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:15.200
COSTS WOULD WOULD BE BUT I THINK

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:15.801
IN IN PRINCIPLE YES.

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:18.103
INVESTING IN SOONER TO REDUCE

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:20.138
RISK LOOK POTENTIALLY VERY LARGE

00:22:20.205 --> 00:22:21.339
AND EXPENSIVE RISK IN THE FUTURE

00:22:21.406 --> 00:22:23.408
CAN CAN MAKE SENSE SO IN THEORY

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:24.976
THERE'S A WAY TO DESIGN.

00:22:25.043 --> 00:22:26.845
A RESOURCES TYPE ON THAT

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:27.145
[inaudible]

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.580
SAVE MONEY [inaudible]

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.649
OVER TIME.

00:22:30.716 --> 00:22:32.517
I WOULD I WOULD THINK SO AGAIN I

00:22:32.584 --> 00:22:33.752
WOULD JUST I WOULD JUST.

00:22:33.819 --> 00:22:35.587
OF COURSE THERE THIS COMES WITH

00:22:35.654 --> 00:22:37.456
A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY BUT BUT BUT

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.757
CERTAINLY IN THEORY YEAH I THINK

00:22:38.824 --> 00:22:40.959
PUTTING MONEY IN TODAY CAN BE

00:22:41.026 --> 00:22:41.860
USED IF IT'S IF YOU'RE.

00:22:41.927 --> 00:22:43.261
IF SOME SOME THIS MAY COME TO TO

00:22:43.328 --> 00:22:44.896
HOW YOU THINK ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC

00:22:44.963 --> 00:22:47.065
BOND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE YOUR

00:22:47.132 --> 00:22:48.433
PROGRAM THE COST EFFECTIVENESS

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.001
COULD BE ONE PRIORITY THAT YOU

00:22:50.068 --> 00:22:51.970
&lt;c.magenta&gt;OOK AT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING&lt;/c&gt;

00:22:52.037 --> 00:22:53.972
ABOUT HOW WHAT PROGRAMS YOU WANT

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:55.107
TO INVEST IN.

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:56.174
AS WELL AS WHAT SPECIFIC

00:22:56.241 --> 00:22:57.843
CRITERIA USED FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:59.678
PROGRAM.

00:22:59.745 --> 00:23:02.681
BUT EVEN IF YOU I MEAN. TO GET.

00:23:02.748 --> 00:23:04.349
BEYOND THEORY THOUGH IF YOU TAKE

00:23:04.416 --> 00:23:05.584
A TRILLION DOLLAR RISK AND

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:06.885
YOU'RE BUYING DOWN TEN BILLION

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.053
DOLLARS THAT RISK -- FIVE

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.488
BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT RISK YOU

00:23:09.554 --> 00:23:10.889
STILL HAVE.

00:23:10.956 --> 00:23:12.891
A NINETY FIVE OR NINETY BILLION

00:23:12.958 --> 00:23:13.992
DOLLAR LIABILITY.

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:15.761
I MEAN I I I I WOULD WE LOVE

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:17.262
SOME INPUT I THINK JUST IN TERMS

00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:19.131
A LEVEL SETTING THE SCOPE OF

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:20.766
INVESTMENT THAT WERE EVEN

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:21.933
CONSIDERING HERE TODAY.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.268
STACKED UP AGAINST THE SCOPE OF

00:23:23.335 --> 00:23:25.237
THE RISK AND JUST ACKNOWLEDGING

00:23:25.303 --> 00:23:26.571
AT LEAST ON AN ORDER OF

00:23:26.638 --> 00:23:28.039
MAGNITUDE BASIS THAT LIKE.

00:23:28.106 --> 00:23:31.109
EVEN IF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:33.278
TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR CLIMATE

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.179
RESILIENCY BOND.

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.281
THIS IS THE THE THE RISK OVER

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.949
THAT SAME PERIOD TIME IS FAR

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:41.753
GREATER -- AND SO WHAT YEAH IT'S

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.621
JUST IT IT.

00:23:42.687 --> 00:23:43.989
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:47.392
US JUST SORT OF LEVEL SET IN

00:23:47.459 --> 00:23:49.394
TERMS OF OUR PRIORITIES I THINK

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:50.061
UNDER.

00:23:50.128 --> 00:23:52.264
IF IF WE WERE TO FALLOW FARMING

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.565
IN ALL THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.933
BECAUSE THE DROUGHTS.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.835
AND ALL THE GROUND WATER DRIED

00:23:56.902 --> 00:23:58.937
UP AND YOU KNOW WE MAY SEE YOU

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:01.206
KNOW THE COTTON YIELDS ARE DOWN

00:24:01.273 --> 00:24:03.675
80% AND YEAH THESE KIND OF COST

00:24:03.742 --> 00:24:05.577
STACK UP IN A SERIOUS WAY VERSUS

00:24:05.644 --> 00:24:06.978
SOME OTHER STRATEGY TO AVERT

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:07.979
THAT SO IS THERE SOME WAY THAT

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:08.613
YOU CAN.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:11.449
GET BACK TO US TO JUST WITH THEM.

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.552
EVEN IF IT'S NOT A MY PERFECT

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:15.353
MATH SOME WAY TO SORT OF SCOPE.

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.455
A RISK BY DOWN STRATEGIES FOR

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:18.423
OURSELVES YEAH I MEAN WE

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.791
CERTAINLY CAN I CAN GO BACK AND

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:21.059
WORK WITH OUR TEAM OF FOLKS AT

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.327
THE OFFICE AND AND SEE IF

00:24:22.394 --> 00:24:24.029
THERE'S SOME WAY WE CAN PRESENT

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:25.664
THAT -- THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:27.866
YOU WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT -- I I

00:24:27.933 --> 00:24:29.267
GUESS MAYBE JUST I WOULD ADD AS

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:31.336
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:34.139
THINKING BOTH ABOUT ERROR OR

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:35.574
BEING CLEAR FOR YOURSELF ABOUT

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.242
IT WHAT RISKY BY NOW WE'RE

00:24:37.309 --> 00:24:38.143
BRINGING.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.544
WE TAKE THAT WE WANT TO BUY DOWN

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:42.414
OVERALL ECONOMIC RISK -- VERSES

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:44.749
WHAT IS THE RISK TO THE STATE

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.818
FINANCES SPECIFICALLY THOSE ARE --

00:24:46.885 --> 00:24:48.687
I THINK BOTH IMPORTANT QUESTION

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:49.221
BUT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:49.988
DISTINCT.

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:50.789
AND THEN AGAIN GOING BACK TO

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.157
POINT A I ALLUDED TO EARLIER

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.192
THINKING ABOUT. SIX AND THAT

00:24:54.259 --> 00:24:56.328
SOME OF THESE RISKS -- ARE TO

00:24:56.394 --> 00:24:57.829
LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE OR PRIVATE

00:24:57.896 --> 00:25:00.832
PROPERTY TO WHAT EXTENT IS THAT

00:25:00.899 --> 00:25:02.267
DO YOU WANT THAT TO BE THE STATE --

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.369
PAIN FOR TO BUY DOWN THAT RISK

00:25:04.436 --> 00:25:06.104
VERSES COULD THAT BE LOOK THERE

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.906
SHOULD BE A LOCAL BUY IN FROM

00:25:07.973 --> 00:25:09.107
LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR SHOULD THAT

00:25:09.174 --> 00:25:09.608
BE.

00:25:09.674 --> 00:25:14.246
AN INDIVIDUAL PRIVATE PROPERTY

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:15.480
OWNERS TYPE OF RESPONSIBILITY.

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:16.748
THANK YOU COMMENTS QUESTIONS YES

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:17.015
CEREMONY.

00:25:17.082 --> 00:25:19.684
COME OF THANK YOU MISTER

HOW DO YOU ADDRESS IT?

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:56.087
WHAT PERCENTAGE MIGHT BE

00:25:56.154 --> 00:25:58.056
ELIGIBLE FOR SOME FEDERAL

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:04.930
IN.

00:26:04.996 --> 00:26:06.865
JUST TAKE ONE FIGURE LIKE THAT

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.900
IN MAY BE BREAK OUT A LITTLE

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:11.336
LATER THE PATHWAYS.

00:26:11.403 --> 00:26:14.472
IN IN YEARS TO PAY THAT OFF.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.641
I'M ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD ON

00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:22.047
PAGE SIX WHERE -- WE'VE REDUCE

00:26:22.113 --> 00:26:26.751
SOME. TO BELOW 5% THE ANNUAL

00:26:26.818 --> 00:26:28.253
INTEREST RATE WE'RE PAYING ON

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.856
OUR OUR OBLIGATIONS.

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.692
AND YOU INDICATED THAT THAT

00:26:33.758 --> 00:26:36.394
FIGURES AFFECTED SOMEWHAT BY OUR

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.330
GENERAL REVENUES.

00:26:38.396 --> 00:26:39.431
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW

00:26:39.497 --> 00:26:41.433
THAT COMPARES TO OTHER STATES

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.401
YOU SAID THERE'S NOT REALLY ARE

00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:44.736
A CORRECT TARGET DATE.

00:26:44.803 --> 00:26:46.438
WE'RE JUST CALIFORNIA SIT FOR

00:26:46.504 --> 00:26:48.039
EXAMPLE WITH OUR DEBT

00:26:48.106 --> 00:26:51.476
OBLIGATIONS VERSES OTHER STATES

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:52.911
OF SIMILAR SIZE.

00:26:52.978 --> 00:26:54.412
YEAH I AM ALL HAVE TO GO BACK

00:26:54.479 --> 00:26:55.513
AND DOUBLE CHECK OF LOOKED AT

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.681
THOSE NUMBERS BUT NOT VERY

00:26:56.748 --> 00:26:58.550
RECENTLY MY GENERAL RECOLLECTION

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:00.185
IS WE'RE KIND OF IN THE NORMAL

00:27:00.251 --> 00:27:02.187
RANGE ONE ON OUT LIAR BUT I CAN

00:27:02.253 --> 00:27:03.288
GO BACK AND AND GIVE YOU MORE

00:27:03.355 --> 00:27:04.089
PRECISE.

00:27:04.155 --> 00:27:06.157
INFORMATION AND IT SEEMS LIKE

00:27:06.224 --> 00:27:07.859
ONE ONE FUNCTION OF THAT PERCENT

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:09.494
IS.

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:11.529
OUR OUR REVENUES.

00:27:11.596 --> 00:27:12.497
FROM.

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:15.734
WE'VE ALSO XCELERATED.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.936
INTEREST PAYMENTS IN SOME RECENT

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.304
BUDGET SAYS THAT CRACKED HIS AT

00:27:19.371 --> 00:27:21.373
BEEN ON BOND AT SERVICERS THAT

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:23.208
JUST BEEN HONOR.

00:27:23.274 --> 00:27:24.642
PENSION LIABILITIES.

00:27:24.709 --> 00:27:27.445
I'M SO OUR INTEREST RATES ARE

00:27:27.512 --> 00:27:29.147
ARE NOT SET BY THE BY THE STATE

00:27:29.214 --> 00:27:30.749
ITS IT'S DETERMINED BY THE

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:32.384
MARKETS IN FRANK.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.353
IN SO -- BUT WE CAN STILL LOOK

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.188
CELERY ARE.

00:27:37.255 --> 00:27:39.524
INTEREST PAYMENTS HONEST YES THE

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:40.592
STATE TREASURER'S OFFICE IS

00:27:40.658 --> 00:27:42.427
AGENCY INVOLVED WITH MANAGING

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:44.896
OUR OUR BOND DAY IN SO THEY WILL

00:27:44.963 --> 00:27:46.598
THEY'LL THEY'LL -- ON A ROUTINE

00:27:46.664 --> 00:27:49.000
BASIS RE ISSUE BOND IN SOME

00:27:49.067 --> 00:27:51.002
CASES ARE LIKE -- PROBABLY IN

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:52.937
SOME CASES PREPAY BOND DEPENDING

00:27:53.004 --> 00:27:54.506
ON THEIR CALCULATION OF HOW THAT

00:27:54.572 --> 00:27:56.174
WILL YIELD THE BEST RETURN FOR

00:27:56.241 --> 00:27:57.308
THE STATE OR THE LOWEST COST

00:27:57.375 --> 00:27:59.377
OVER OVER THE LONG RUN INSIGHT I

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:01.346
THEY ACTIVELY MANAGE.

00:28:01.413 --> 00:28:02.847
THAT PORTFOLIO.

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:04.449
CAN I WOULD BE CURIOUS JUST TO

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:07.886
SEE AGAIN I REALIZE SETS.

00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:08.853
CERTAINLY FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:14.426
THAT. 5% IS NOT AN ALARMING.

00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:16.194
FIGURE THAT'S WITHIN THE

00:28:16.261 --> 00:28:17.862
BALLPARK OF REASONABLE.

00:28:17.929 --> 00:28:18.897
YEAH I I BELIEVE IT IS BUT I'LL

00:28:18.963 --> 00:28:20.365
DEFINITELY GET BACK TO YOU WITH

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:22.367
THE SPECIFICS THANK YOU WE RANK

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:25.236
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:28.406
THANK YOU SENATE CAREER.

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:29.874
NOT SURE HAVE A QUESTION HERE

00:28:29.941 --> 00:28:33.845
BUT BUT I AM.

00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.814
WHAT WHAT MAY MAKE SENSE?

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.849
AS WE GET INTO FUTURE

00:28:37.916 --> 00:28:39.350
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RISKS.

00:28:39.417 --> 00:28:40.685
FROM DIFFERENT.

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:41.753
ACTIVITIES WHETHER IT'S FIRE

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.755
ACTIVITY WHETHER IT'S C. RISE

00:28:43.822 --> 00:28:45.890
WHETHER IT'S DROUGHT -- THAT WE

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:49.527
MAY WANT TO ASK -- OUR EXPERTS

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:50.829
TO COME IN AND DO A PANEL ON

00:28:50.895 --> 00:28:52.530
WHAT SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

00:28:52.597 --> 00:28:54.032
IMPACTS AND SOME OF THE

00:28:54.099 --> 00:28:56.968
SOLUTIONS MIGHT BE -- BUT I I A

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:58.937
IT'S A WORD OF CAUTION BECAUSE

00:28:59.003 --> 00:29:01.272
WE HAD SOME MODELING DONE A

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:02.874
NUMBER OF YEARS AGO [inaudible]

00:29:02.941 --> 00:29:07.011
BACK IN. EIGHT AND NINE THAT

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.146
SHOWED THAT IF WE HAD A MAJOR

00:29:08.213 --> 00:29:09.814
EARTHQUAKE.

00:29:09.881 --> 00:29:11.950
IN THE DELTA.

00:29:12.016 --> 00:29:14.752
ANYWHERE ABOVE SIX POINT.

00:29:14.819 --> 00:29:17.489
TWO THAT THE REPERCUSSIONS WERE

00:29:17.555 --> 00:29:19.691
SUCH THAT WE MIGHT LOSE.

00:29:19.757 --> 00:29:21.159
THE SOURCE OF WATER.

00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:22.760
BECAUSE OF THE THE MIXTURE OF

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:25.563
SALT AND FRESHWATER.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.164
ANY IMPACT TWO THIRDS OF THE

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:27.332
STATE'S.

00:29:27.398 --> 00:29:29.701
POPULATION BY THAT AND FRANKLY I

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.736
HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING THAT TELLS

00:29:31.803 --> 00:29:34.139
US THAT WE STARTED TO TAKE CARE

00:29:34.205 --> 00:29:35.907
OF SOME OF THAT.

00:29:35.974 --> 00:29:37.542
SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS.

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:38.843
THROUGH THE BONDS THAT WE'VE

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.712
PASSED THAT WOULD PROVIDE US

00:29:40.778 --> 00:29:42.180
WITH A DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THAT

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:43.281
THAT WOULDN'T HAPPEN THAT THERE

00:29:43.348 --> 00:29:44.682
WERE THERE BECAUSE THERE WERE

00:29:44.749 --> 00:29:45.817
SOME SOLUTIONS.

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:48.219
BUYING BUYING PROPERTY CREATING

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:49.420
STORAGE AND ALL THAT KIND OF

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:51.256
GOOD STUFF SO SO I JUST THINK

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:52.590
THAT THE MORE THE MORE

00:29:52.657 --> 00:29:53.992
INFORMATION WE HAVE THE BETTER.

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.693
OFF WILL BE BUT I ALSO THINK AS

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:56.995
A NOTE OF CAUTION THAT WE HAVE

00:29:57.061 --> 00:29:57.962
TO TIE.

00:29:58.029 --> 00:30:01.933
THE THE SOLUTIONS TO THE BONDS.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.068
SO THAT IN A VERY DELIBERATE WAY

00:30:04.135 --> 00:30:05.703
WE DON'T USE THEM FOR OTHER

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:09.974
THINGS BASED ON KIND OF THE THE

00:30:10.041 --> 00:30:11.409
WHATEVER IS HAPPENING AT THAT

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.611
PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME SO I I

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.246
DO HAVE ONE QUESTION WHICH IS --

00:30:15.313 --> 00:30:17.615
HOW DO YOU PERCEIVE THIS AS

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.384
DIFFERENT FROM CAP AND TRADE?

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.186
IN IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE HOW

00:30:21.252 --> 00:30:23.221
WOULD WE HOW WOULD WE PROTECT

00:30:23.288 --> 00:30:24.489
OURSELVES SO THE CAP AND TRADE

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:25.924
IS DOING ONE THING AND AND THIS

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.692
IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE OR MAYBE

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:29.227
THEY'RE SYNERGISTIC.

00:30:29.294 --> 00:30:32.230
AND YOU HAVE A OPINION ON THAT.

00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.531
WHAT WE DO USE CAP AND TRADE

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:35.400
FUNDING ON A LIMITED BASIS RIGHT

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:36.935
NOW FOR A CLAIM IS SPECIFIC FOR

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.303
CLIMB ADAPTATION ACTIVITY RIGHT

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:41.906
MOSTLY WITH THE FOR THE --

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.741
COASTAL COMMISSION -- THE

00:30:43.808 --> 00:30:47.378
CONSERVANCY AND THE THE AND SAN

00:30:47.445 --> 00:30:50.081
FRANCISCO BAY AT FORTY AND SO --

00:30:50.148 --> 00:30:50.982
THEY'RE MOSTLY WORKING ON

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:53.284
CLIMATE -- LEVEL OF FACTS IN

00:30:53.351 --> 00:30:54.919
PLANNING AND AND SOME PROJECTS

00:30:54.986 --> 00:30:57.589
ALONG THE COAST -- IN TERMS OF

00:30:57.655 --> 00:31:00.024
HOW BONDS CAN BE USE VERSES CAP

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.659
AND TRADE I THINK THEY THEY BOTH

00:31:01.726 --> 00:31:03.027
CAN BE USED FOR CLIMATE AT

00:31:03.094 --> 00:31:05.096
ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES I I

00:31:05.163 --> 00:31:05.663
WOULDN'T BE THEM IN MUTUALLY

00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:06.531
EXCLUSIVE.

00:31:06.598 --> 00:31:08.533
YOU MIGHT THINK IF IF YOU ARE

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.667
FOR EXAMPLE THINKING ABOUT A

00:31:09.734 --> 00:31:11.769
LONGER TERM BROADER STRATEGY FOR

00:31:11.836 --> 00:31:13.137
CLIMATE ADAPTATION.

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:14.973
THERE MAY BE REASON TO THINK

00:31:15.039 --> 00:31:16.441
ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO USE BONDS

00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:18.176
FOR THOSE LONGER TERM PROJECTS

00:31:18.243 --> 00:31:19.244
AND PERHAPS YOU'D WANT TO USE

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.812
CAP AND TRADE FOR A DIFFERENT

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:23.948
SET OF PROJECTS -- A IF YOU WANT

00:31:24.015 --> 00:31:25.149
IF YOU NEEDED TO DO MORE

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:26.117
PLANNING YOU WOULDN'T REALLY

00:31:26.184 --> 00:31:28.086
WHEN YOU BOUGHT IT FOR HIM TO

00:31:28.152 --> 00:31:28.886
EXTRACT IT HE'S PLANNING

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:30.321
ACTIVITY YOU MAY KNOW WHEN USED.

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:31.589
YOUR BOND MONEY FOR THAT THAT

00:31:31.656 --> 00:31:33.191
MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE USE

00:31:33.258 --> 00:31:34.659
FOR CAP AND TRADE FUNDING BUT

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:36.361
THERE'S NO REASON -- THAT I'M

00:31:36.427 --> 00:31:37.895
AWARE F THE CAP AND TRADE WOULD

00:31:37.962 --> 00:31:42.667
BE AN INAPPROPRIATE USE FOR

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:44.569
ADAPTATION ACTIVITIES.

00:31:44.636 --> 00:31:45.136
THANK YOU OTHERS QUESTIONS

TRIED GET GRANULAR AS MUCH AS WE

CAN BUT THE LIABILITY INSERTED

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:12.230
SOLUTION SETS TO DO THAT.

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:13.631
I I APPRECIATE THE POINT ABOUT

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:17.402

THE ANALYSIS.

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:48.920
NOW IS THE HOUSES POINTS OUT

00:34:48.986 --> 00:34:50.955
THIS BILL SB FORTY FIVE IS A

IF THIS PASSED BY THE VOTERS.

00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.506
SB FORTY FIVE WILL IT WOULD FIND

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:10.041
ON THE GROUND PROJECTS DESIGNED

00:35:10.107 --> 00:35:11.375
TO HELP US PREPARE FOR THE

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:12.743
EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:13.878
AND OTHER IMPACTS THAT WE'RE

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.213
SEEING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE

00:35:15.279 --> 00:35:18.616
CHANGE -- AND AS A RESULT OF OF

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.319
ALL OF OUR CHANGING ENVIRONMENT.

00:35:21.385 --> 00:35:23.888
WILDFIRES FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.656
DROUGHTS IT CENTER -- WE'RE

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:27.458
LIVING IN A WORLD TODAY THAT HAS

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:29.260
WORN BY JUST ONE DEGREE SINCE

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:30.528
THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS WHEN

00:35:30.595 --> 00:35:32.763
RECORDS -- BEGAN ON A GLOBAL

00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:33.931
SCALE.

00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:35.333
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE FIRES

00:35:35.399 --> 00:35:36.701
MUDSLIDES ARE PROLONGED DROUGHT

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:38.903
OR SEVERE WEATHERS -- STORMS ARE

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:40.471
ALL A RESULT OF A CHANGE OF JUST

00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.039
ONE DEGREE CELSIUS BUT THE SAD

00:35:42.106 --> 00:35:43.140
TRUTH IS.

00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:45.710
THAT -- WE KNOW THAT THE LEASES

00:35:45.776 --> 00:35:47.311
SCIENTISTS ARE TELLING US THAT --

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:48.079
THE INCREASES ARE GOING TO BE

00:35:48.145 --> 00:35:50.448
QUITE A BIT MORE SIGNIFICANT THE

00:35:50.515 --> 00:35:52.183
GOAL OF THE GLOBAL PARIS CLIMATE.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:53.217
AGREEMENT WAS TO KEEP THE

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:54.552
WORLD'S TEMPERATURE FROM RISING

00:35:54.619 --> 00:35:55.853
MORE THAN TWO DEGREES CELSIUS

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.955
OVER PRE INDUSTRIAL TIMES BUT

00:35:58.022 --> 00:35:58.556
THE AGREEMENTS MORE AMBITIOUS

00:35:58.623 --> 00:36:00.224
GOALS -- WAS TO PREVENT

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.726
TEMPERATURES ARE RISING MORE

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.094
THAN ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.196
CELSIUS AND THAT'S BECAUSE EVEN

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:05.997
ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES OF

00:36:06.063 --> 00:36:07.498
WARMING WILL CAUSE CATASTROPHIC

00:36:07.565 --> 00:36:08.666
EFFECTS INCLUDING MORE INTENSE

00:36:08.733 --> 00:36:09.500
STORMS.

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:11.469
HEARING HE WEIGHS MASS

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:13.204
EXTINCTIONS DROUGHTS ETCETERA.

00:36:13.271 --> 00:36:16.741
AND IF WE HAD TWO DEGREES THE

00:36:16.807 --> 00:36:17.975
EFFECTS WILL BE EVEN WORSE.

00:36:18.042 --> 00:36:18.576
NOW THAT THE TRUTH IS THAT WE

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:19.176
ACTUALLY KNOW THAT WE'RE ON

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.978
TRACK RIGHT NOW TO SEE MORE THAN

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.013
THREE PER THREE DEGREES OF

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.314
INCREASED ABOVE PREINDUSTRIAL

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:25.650
LEVELS BY. TWENTY ONE HUNDRED

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:27.184
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE NOT ON

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:29.654
TRACK OUT TOWARD THE SCHOOL SO

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:30.421
THE POINT IS.

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.657
WE WE ARE WE'RE FIGHTING AGAINST

00:36:32.723 --> 00:36:34.258
THE WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO

00:36:34.325 --> 00:36:36.227
MITIGATE AND AND AND AND REDUCE

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:38.362
OUR ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO

00:36:38.429 --> 00:36:40.531
CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WE ALSO NEED

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:41.198
TO UNDERSTAND THE CLIMATE CHANGE

00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:41.832
IS HAPPENING.

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.401
WE SEE IN THE IMPACTS OF ALL

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.069
ALREADY AND WE NEED TO HAVE

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.337
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:49.407
PROTECT AGAINST -- THE IMPACTS

00:36:49.473 --> 00:36:50.908
AND BE MORE RESILIENT.

00:36:50.975 --> 00:36:53.244
AND SO -- WHAT THIS MEASURED

00:36:53.311 --> 00:36:55.012
SEEKS TO DO IS REDUCE FIRE

00:36:55.079 --> 00:36:56.213
RESCUE AND RESTORE ALREADY

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.082
DAMAGED AREAS A RESTORED PROTECT

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.584
IMPACTED WETLANDS WATERSHEDS

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.685
WATERWAYS?

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.253
COASTAL RESOURCES FISH AND

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.888
WILDLIFE POPULATIONS REDUCE

00:37:03.955 --> 00:37:05.256
IMPACTS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:37:05.323 --> 00:37:06.724
AND ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:08.059
AND IMPROVE THE RESILIENCY OF

00:37:08.125 --> 00:37:09.827
THE STATE'S WATER SUPPLIES AND

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:10.995
AGRICULTURAL LANDS.

00:37:11.062 --> 00:37:12.196
NO ONE LIKE PREVIOUS BOND

00:37:12.263 --> 00:37:13.497
MEASURES TO FIND PARKS AND OPEN

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:15.933
SPACE ALL THINGS THAT WE SUPPORT --

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.468
THIS BOND IS FOCUSED ON HELPING

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:19.003
OUR STATE BECOME MORE RESILIENT

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:20.338
TO RISING TEMPERATURES AND TO

00:37:20.404 --> 00:37:21.872
ENSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO ADAPT.

00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:23.074
TO A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT'S THE

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:24.709
FOCUS HERE SO DEDICATES A

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.310
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING TO

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.712
THE FIRE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:37:27.778 --> 00:37:29.380
DISCUSSING IT WILL -- FUND

00:37:29.447 --> 00:37:30.581
PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE FIRE

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.616
RISK IN YOUR CMMUNITIES AND

00:37:31.682 --> 00:37:32.650
ENSURE A FORCE ARE HEALTHY

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.218
ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND MORE INTENSE

00:37:34.285 --> 00:37:35.319
WILDFIRES.

00:37:35.386 --> 00:37:36.787
ARE THERE OTHER POTS THAT INVEST

00:37:36.854 --> 00:37:37.888
IN PROJECTS THAT WILL REDUCE THE

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:38.823
RISK OF CATASTROPHIC FLOOD

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:40.758
EVENTS BY SLOWING RUNOFF

00:37:40.825 --> 00:37:41.225
IMPROVING GROUND WATER

00:37:41.292 --> 00:37:42.226
INFILTRATION.

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:44.261
AND PROTECTING COASTAL

00:37:44.328 --> 00:37:45.863
COMMUNITIES FROM SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:47.565
SO THERE IS A THERE ARE NUMBER

00:37:47.632 --> 00:37:49.634
OF OF DIFFERENT THINGS WE CAN

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.569
OPEN UP THIS DISCUSSION -- BUT

00:37:51.636 --> 00:37:52.670
YOU KNOW THE FACT IS THAT WHEN

00:37:52.737 --> 00:37:53.738
WE HAD OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.072
ON THE NEW ABNORMAL IN FIRE

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:57.274
PRONE REGIONS WE HEARD THE

00:37:57.341 --> 00:37:57.975

FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:02.413
PREVENTION WE CAN SAVE SIX

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.047
DOLLARS.

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:03.914
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:05.683
HERE WE MUST TAKE AGGRESSIVE

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:06.550
ACTION.

00:38:06.617 --> 00:38:08.586
AT IN IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:10.087
IN INCREASING OUR RESILIENCY AND

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:11.722
I HAVE WITH ME JOE HAD MISSING

00:38:11.789 --> 00:38:12.890

THE MOUNT RECREATION

00:38:31.509 --> 00:38:32.877
CONSERVATION AUTHORITY WHICH IS

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:34.545
A JOINT POWERS BETWEEN THE SANTA

OUR RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT

00:38:37.348 --> 00:38:39.383
PARTNERS.

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:40.818
IN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS --

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:43.821
THE LA -- WAS VERY RESTRAINED AS

00:38:43.888 --> 00:38:45.256
THEY ALWAYS ARE.

00:38:45.322 --> 00:38:47.958
VERY -- AND CLICK CLICK CLICK.

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:49.927
I'M NOT GOING TO BE RESTRAINED

00:38:49.994 --> 00:38:52.296
MISTER CHAIRMAN BECAUSE I COME

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:53.931
FROM YOUR DISTRICT.

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.366
A THIRD YOUR DISTRICT BURNED

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:57.668
LAST YEAR.

00:38:57.735 --> 00:39:00.004
ALMOST 50% OF THE REST IS IN

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:01.439
DANGER.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.942
WE'RE LOOKING AT FLASH EQUALS.

00:39:05.009 --> 00:39:06.310
IT WAS WONDERFUL TO SEE THOSE

00:39:06.377 --> 00:39:08.012
BEAUTIFUL WILD FLOWERS IT WAS

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.747
WONDERFUL SHE THE ALL THE GREEN

00:39:09.814 --> 00:39:10.881
GRASS.

00:39:10.948 --> 00:39:13.417
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS WE CALL

00:39:13.484 --> 00:39:13.617
THAT.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:14.518
CAN GOING [inaudible]

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:16.287
IT'S KINDLING.

00:39:16.353 --> 00:39:18.322
AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE WE'RE

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.857
NOT GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:21.759
DROUGHT SUMMER.

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:23.894
AND TWO YEARS AGO THREE YEARS

00:39:23.961 --> 00:39:25.362
AGO I REMEMBER EVERYONE WAS

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:26.797
SAYING YOU KNOW THESE ARE

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:29.333
EXTRAORDINARY SITUATIONS WE HAVE

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.000
HERE WE COME I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:31.502
BEFORE.

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:32.369
AND THEN THE YEAR AFTER THAT IT

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:34.805
WAS -- WE INTERESTING WE'RE

00:39:34.872 --> 00:39:36.107
SEEING IT NOW TWICE IN A ROW.

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:40.044
AFTER LAST YEAR WE CANNOT SAY.

00:39:40.111 --> 00:39:41.479
WELL MAYBE THINGS WILL GET

00:39:41.545 --> 00:39:43.347
BETTER.

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:48.652
I THINK THE BETTER ARGUMENT IS

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.420
THEY'RE PROBABLY GOING TO GET

00:39:49.487 --> 00:39:50.321
WORSE.

00:39:50.387 --> 00:39:53.090
AN EVEN IF THIS BILL IS PASSED

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:53.657
AND IF IT IS EVEN IF IT IS

00:39:53.724 --> 00:39:56.627
PASSED IN MARCH.

00:39:56.694 --> 00:39:58.028
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO HEAR IS

00:39:58.095 --> 00:39:59.597
BEFORE THIS MONEY CAN ACTUALLY

00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:02.266
GET OUT AND DO SOME GOOD.

00:40:02.333 --> 00:40:04.068
SO WE FOR AIMING TO DEAL WITH AN

00:40:04.135 --> 00:40:05.536
EMERGENCY SITUATION WHICH I

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:07.071
THINK WE ARE MISTER CHAIRMAN IN

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:08.072
YOUR DISTRICT AND WE'RE GOING TO

00:40:08.139 --> 00:40:09.640
BE WORKING WITH YOU TO SEE WHAT

00:40:09.707 --> 00:40:10.574
WE CAN DO.

00:40:10.641 --> 00:40:12.209
IMMEDIATELY WE GOT TWO YEARS

00:40:12.276 --> 00:40:13.711
WORTH OF DANGER.

00:40:13.778 --> 00:40:15.112
AND THIS IS TRUE THROUGHOUT THE

00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:16.147
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:40:16.213 --> 00:40:17.648
SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH

00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.283
IS ACADEMIC THIS IS NOT

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.352
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DECIDE

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:22.920
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE

00:40:22.987 --> 00:40:24.955
TWENTY YEARS FORTY YEARS

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:26.090
WHATEVER IT IS.

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:27.424
TELL THAT TO PEOPLE.

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:28.893

00:40:28.959 --> 00:40:30.795
LEGISLATURE AND SAY YOU HAD AN

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.363
OPPORTUNITY YOU HAD AN

00:40:32.429 --> 00:40:34.832
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE TO

00:40:34.899 --> 00:40:36.534
MAKE THINGS BETTER TO ADAPT

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.501
CALIFORNIA?

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:39.703
IF YOU ANSWER TO THEM WE TRIED

00:40:39.770 --> 00:40:42.339
OUR BEST WONDERFUL IF YOU

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:47.311
ANSWERED WELL WE DIDN'T

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:47.611
[inaudible]

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:49.547
F. SAID.

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:50.781
I CHIEF.

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:52.149
AGAIN MY NAME IS EILEEN TIGHTLY

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:53.551
I AM THE FIRE CHIEF EAST BAY

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.152
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT THAT WE

00:40:55.219 --> 00:40:57.054
WERE FOUND IN NINETEEN THIRTY

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:57.655
FOUR FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY

00:40:57.721 --> 00:40:58.856
NOT KNOW WHERE THE LARGEST LOCAL

00:40:58.923 --> 00:40:59.924
PARK.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.860
DISTRICT OR AGENCY IN THE NATION --

00:41:02.927 --> 00:41:04.595
WE OPERATE OVER A HUNDRED AND

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:05.863
TWENTY ONE THOUSAND ACRES.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:07.064
AND WE SERVE TWO POINT SEVEN

00:41:07.131 --> 00:41:09.200
MILLION RESIDENTS IN ALAMEDA AND

00:41:09.266 --> 00:41:10.467
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.

00:41:10.534 --> 00:41:12.837
SO WE ALSO ENJOY ABOUT TWENTY

00:41:12.903 --> 00:41:14.405
FIVE MILLION VISITORS A YEAR.

00:41:14.471 --> 00:41:17.041
I AM MY FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS THE

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.776
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:20.411
TO THE NINETEEN NINETY ONE

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:22.213
TUNNEL FIRE WE CALL IT WHETHER

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.047
THE MEDIA CALL THE OAKLAND HILLS

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:23.881
FIRE.

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:25.382
AND IN THAT FIRE IT'S IMPORTANT

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:27.284
TO REMEMBER THAT IT WAS THREE

00:41:27.351 --> 00:41:28.285
THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE LOST

00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:29.954
ONLY THREE THOUSAND HOMES THAT

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.355
WERE LOST YOU COULD SAY NOW.

00:41:31.422 --> 00:41:32.890
AND AT TWENTY SIX PEOPLE LOST

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:33.991
THEIR LIVES.

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:35.926
WHAT THAT REALLY DID FOR THE

00:41:35.993 --> 00:41:38.629
PARK DISTRICT WAS -- AS A LARGE

00:41:38.696 --> 00:41:42.166
LAND MANAGEMENT AGENCY IS -- TO

00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:44.168
CALL US TO FOCUS ON RESILIENT

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.103
FIRE PROTECTION AS AS ALMOST A

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.873
MORAL MANDATE.

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:51.342
SO AS A LARGE LAND MANAGEMENT

00:41:51.408 --> 00:41:52.910
AGENCY WE UNDERSTAND THE

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.645
NECESSARY THE NECESSITY BETWEEN

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:56.513
STEWARDSHIP OF THE LAND AND ALSO

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.748
FORCE MANAGEMENT.

00:41:57.815 --> 00:42:00.384
WE FOUND IN OUR PRACTICES THAT

00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.786
EQUALS RESILIENCY WE'RE NOT

00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:04.121
SAYING THAT WE CAN STOP A FIRE

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.556
FROM HAPPENING ON OUR LANDS BUT

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.258
WE ARE SAYING THAT WITH

00:42:07.324 --> 00:42:08.792
STEWARDSHIP AND FORCE MANAGEMENT.

00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:11.395
WE CAN MAKE OUR FORESTS -- IN

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:12.830
OUR WILD AND URBAN INTERFACE IS

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.298
MORE RESILIENT THE FIRES IN

00:42:14.365 --> 00:42:15.833
THERE FOR AMERICA MORE

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.369
SURVIVABLE -- SO AT THAT POINT

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:21.105
WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A LONG TERM

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:22.606
UNDERSTANDING COMMITMENT REALLY

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.208
TO HEALTHY FORESTS.

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:26.010
WITH THAT COMMITMENT CAME A WILD

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:27.278
FIRE HAZARD REDUCTION AND

00:42:27.344 --> 00:42:28.579
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:31.582
OUR BOARD SIGNED -- IN TWENTY

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:32.783
TEN AND WE ONLY RECENTLY GOT THE

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.318
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE TO

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:36.253
ACTUALLY SPEND THOSE MONIES.

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.555
IN.

00:42:38.622 --> 00:42:39.156
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN I GUESS

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.624
THE MESSAGE WE WANT TO SEND IS

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:42.860
THAT THE THE CLOCK IS REALLY

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:45.429
TAKING DEMAND.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:47.031
WILL INCREASE AND ACCELERATE.

00:42:47.097 --> 00:42:49.767
AS CLIMATE CHANGE -- CONTINUES.

00:42:49.833 --> 00:42:51.435
TO BE HERE THE NEED IS URGENT.

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.304
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT WAS LAST

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.106
YEAR FOR THIRTEEN DAYS SOLID --

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:58.575
IN THE BAY AREA IT'S GOT OVER

00:42:58.642 --> 00:43:00.010
TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:01.745
OF THOSE JUST THE THE RESIDENTS

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:03.047
THAT LIVE WITHIN ALAMEDA AND

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.415
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.

00:43:04.481 --> 00:43:06.350
WE HAD THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:07.618
THE WORLD BECAUSE OF THE

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:10.554
CAMPFIRE -- WORSE THAN BEIJING

00:43:10.621 --> 00:43:13.324
AND IT SHUT DOWN SCHOOLS FOR

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:14.558
LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND ALSO A

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.260
LOT OF BUSINESSES AND AND I'M

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:19.330
SURE -- WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT --

00:43:19.396 --> 00:43:23.734
ECONOMICALLY -- A BONDS OF THIS

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:24.868
OF THIS NATURE WOULD REALLY

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.236
ACCELERATE THE WORK AND LEVERAGE

00:43:26.303 --> 00:43:27.938
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FROM CAL

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:30.808
FIRE FEMA HELLO YES.

00:43:30.874 --> 00:43:32.176
AND WE'RE IN A RACE AT THIS

00:43:32.242 --> 00:43:34.144
POINT.

00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:35.579
CATASTROPHIC FIRES RELEASE MORE

00:43:35.646 --> 00:43:37.614
CARBON EXACERBATING THE PACE OF

00:43:37.681 --> 00:43:39.016
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WE SAW THAT

00:43:39.083 --> 00:43:40.117
AS AN EXAMPLE THAT I JUST GAVE

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:42.286
YOU OF OF THE THIRTEEN DAYS

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:43.587
WHERE PEOPLE WERE WEARING.

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:45.255
MASKS EVERY TIME THEY WENT

00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:47.291
OUTSIDE.

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:48.625
THIS BOND MEASURE IS KIND OF A

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:50.227
FIRST RESPONDER TOOL -- IT'S

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:52.396
URGENT.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:54.365
IT'S JUST ONE POLL TOOL THAT WE

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.767
CAN USE THE TOOL BOX -- LONG

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:59.003
TERM VEGETATION MANAGEMENT NEEDS.

00:43:59.069 --> 00:44:01.105
REQUIRE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.539
STATEWIDE COMMITMENTS.

00:44:02.606 --> 00:44:04.308
AND SENATOR ALLEN'S BOND MEASURE

00:44:04.375 --> 00:44:05.976
STARTS A CONVERSATION.

00:44:06.043 --> 00:44:08.445
THANK YOU.

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:16.120
THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:17.721
KAUFMAN GERMAN STERN MEMBERS OF

00:44:19.857 --> 00:44:20.524
FOREST TRUST AGAIN.

00:44:20.591 --> 00:44:21.725
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:23.360
DECADES NOW AND I'D SAY THE

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:24.795
THING THAT SCARES ME MORE THAN

00:44:24.862 --> 00:44:26.563
ANYTHING ELSE IS THE LACK OF

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.798
URGENCY.

00:44:27.865 --> 00:44:29.933
THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND ADAPTING

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.268
TO THE INEVITABLE AFFECTS OF

00:44:31.335 --> 00:44:32.836
CLIMATE CHANGE WE TALK A LOT

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.204
ABOUT HOW IT'S GONNA GET A

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:35.506
LITTLE BIT WARMER A LITTLE BIT

00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:37.841
DRIER TWO DEGREES AT ALL SEEMS A

00:44:37.908 --> 00:44:39.410
CONCEPTUALLY MANAGEABLE.

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.911
AND THAT'S GONNA BE BAD BUT IS

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.413
THE EXTREME EVENTS THAT ARE

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.714
REALLY GOING TO BE DEVASTATING

00:44:43.781 --> 00:44:45.315
THOSE YOU KNOW ATMOSPHERIC

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:47.518
RIVERS AT THIS PARK AND DROPPING

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.053
ALL TWO FEET OF WATER IN A

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.487
WATERSHED OVER A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:44:50.554 --> 00:44:52.456
THOSE ARE WHERE WE ARE SO FAR

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:53.824
BEHIND THE CURVE OFGETTING

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:54.892
PREPARED.

THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL

ROLL I THINK WE OFTEN GET TO OUR

00:51:44.301 --> 00:51:46.303
SHORELINE BUT WE DON'T LOOK AT

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:49.339
HOW OCEAN HEALTH IS AFFECTING.

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:51.174

THEN ALSO JUST TO A MORE GENERAL

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:06.122
QUESTION.

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:08.225
IS THERE ANY METRIC THE YEAR

WHERE EVER THAT WE COULD LOOK.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.528
FOR THAT WOULD LOOK AT HOW

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:14.564
INVESTMENT DOLLARS MOST DIRECTLY.

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:17.434

00:52:23.106 --> 00:52:25.475
IN TERMS OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:27.077
THERE MAY BE SOME THAT MORE

00:52:27.143 --> 00:52:29.546
IMMEDIATELY PROTECT COMMUNITIES

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:31.147
AT RISK.

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:34.050
WHETHER IT'S AIR POLLUTION --

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:36.186
OTHER THAN THAT HAVE A A

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.355
TRACEABLE IN CURRENTLY KNOWN

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:40.857
PUBLIC HEALTH ADVERSE IMPACTS SO.

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:56.640
THEY BOTH FANTASTIC SUGGESTS

00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:58.141
ACTUALLY SERVE ON THE OCEAN

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.943
PACIFIC COUNCIL SO -- I'M BY

OR WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:19.362
CATEGORIES OF INVESTMENT SOME

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.730
MAY HAVE A MORE IMMEDIATE

00:53:20.797 --> 00:53:24.901
BENEFIT TO AIR QUALITY AND OR I

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:26.736

DISCUSSION.

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.527

CALIFORNIA -- I THINK THERE'S

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.039
SOME CLIMATE CHANGE CHANGE BY

00:54:03.106 --> 00:54:04.307
PRODUCTS THAT ARE -- FAIRLY

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:05.642
SIGNIFICANT THAT WE REALLY

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:08.211
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT -- ONE IS

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:09.446
THE POTENTIAL FOR FOOD SHORTAGES

00:54:09.512 --> 00:54:10.814
SEARCH SHORTAGE JUDGE

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.316
METICULOUSLY -- AS IT RELATES TO

00:54:13.383 --> 00:54:15.151
FEEDING OUR COUNTRY -- I'VE

00:54:15.218 --> 00:54:19.022
ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT -- WAS THAT.

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.390
A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE THAT

00:54:20.457 --> 00:54:22.292
WE CONTROL OUR OWN FOOD SOURCE

00:54:22.359 --> 00:54:23.893
BECAUSE THE MINUTE SOMEONE

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.462
DOESN'T LIKE US THAT ME.

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.998
REALLY IMPACT -- HOW WE GET OUR

00:54:28.064 --> 00:54:30.033
FOOD AND IT'S BECOME MORE CLEAR

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.935
WITH THEIR -- WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.003
WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.638
WERE ANGERING A BUNCH OF OUR

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:35.505
ALLIES AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO

00:54:35.572 --> 00:54:38.108
HELP US EAT -- IN THE FUTURE --

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.876
BUT ALSO IT WOULD THERE'S A

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:43.113
GREAT POTENTIAL -- FOR FOR THE

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:49.419
CONFLUENCE OF ISSUES STATION.

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:51.554
DEVASTATING IMPACT ON RURAL

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:53.523
RESIDENTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE

00:54:53.590 --> 00:54:55.091
IF WE HAVE TO FOLLOW AND WE

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.327
DON'T HAVE A GOOD -- SOLUTION TO

00:54:57.394 --> 00:54:58.828
WHAT THE WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:01.031
THAT LAND ALTERNATIVELY THAT WE

00:55:01.097 --> 00:55:02.565
MAY END UP WITH DUST BOWL TYPE

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:04.868
OF MIGRATION PATTERNS THAT.

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:07.003
REALLY NOT DEVASTATOR RURAL

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:08.605
RURAL COMMUNITIES ECONOMIES BUT

00:55:08.672 --> 00:55:10.740
ALSO MAKE PEOPLE MOVE -- FROM

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:12.375
WROTE CALIFORNIA AND LOSE ALL OF

00:55:12.442 --> 00:55:13.777
THE ASSETS THAT THEY'VE INVESTED

00:55:13.843 --> 00:55:16.146
THERE AS WELL SMALL FARMERS AS

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.847
WELL AS AS WHOLE WHOLE

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:20.483
COMMUNITIES -- SO I'D LIKE TO

00:55:20.550 --> 00:55:21.317
WORK WITH YOU ON THAT SO THAT WE

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.052
CAN.

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:23.853
LOOK DOWN THE ROAD AND WE MEAN

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:25.055
NEED TO DO.

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.690
I MEAN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS IN

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:28.825
TERMS OF OF WHAT THE LA --

00:55:28.892 --> 00:55:30.326
PRESENTED BUT WE MAY NEED TO DO

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:31.428
SOME MODELING SO WE CAN FIGURE

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.363
OUT WHERE ARE THE IMPACTS LIKELY

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:35.598
TO HIT FIRST -- AND HOW CAN WE

00:55:35.665 --> 00:55:37.801
START CREATING THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:55:37.867 --> 00:55:38.935
TO BE ABLE TO DO THINGS A LITTLE

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:40.670
BIT DIFFERENTLY WHETHER IT'S

00:55:40.737 --> 00:55:43.573
MOVE WATER WHETHER IT'S CREATE --

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.542
OTHER SOLUTIONS THEY'RE NOT ON

00:55:45.608 --> 00:55:47.043
WERE EIGHTY GREAT IDEAS LED TO

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:48.344
WORK WITH YOU AND BY THE WAY I

CAN HELP AND NOTICE.

00:55:48.978 --> 00:55:49.813
PART OF THE BIG DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.147
BREXIT RIGHT NOW IN THE U. K. IS

00:55:51.214 --> 00:55:55.985
IS WHAT DISTRICT CREDIBLE

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:56.753
DISRUPTION.

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:57.954
THE BREAK AWAY FROM THE YOU WILL

00:55:58.021 --> 00:55:58.855
COST TO THEIR FOOD CHAIN FOOD

00:55:58.922 --> 00:55:59.489
SUPPLY BECAUSE THEY'VE BECOME SO

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.657
DEPENDENT ON GROWERS IN OTHER

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:01.624
PARTS OF THE FOR THE REGION AND

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:02.859
IT'S REALLY.

00:56:02.926 --> 00:56:03.993
A MAJOR STICKING POINT.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.895
SO THAT THAT'S A VERY

00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.030
INSTRUCTIVE POINT [inaudible]

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:22.579
INTO IT.

00:56:22.645 --> 00:56:24.047
NOT AN EASY THING TO DO.

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:25.215
AND AND GETTING TO THE KIND OF

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:26.382
THE URGENCY OF THE MATTER I JUST

00:56:26.449 --> 00:56:28.451
WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THIS

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.352
LEGISLATURE BUDGETED.

00:56:29.419 --> 00:56:31.321

IN RECENT HISTORY AND THAT IS

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:49.239
DEFINITELY OUT OF CONCERN FOR

00:56:49.305 --> 00:56:49.806
WHAT IS HAPPENING ACROSS THE

00:56:49.873 --> 00:56:51.374
STATE.

00:56:51.441 --> 00:56:53.042
AND THEN IF WE REALLY HAVE A

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.645
SENSE OF URGENCY ON THIS I I DO

00:56:55.712 --> 00:56:57.981

REALLY RELY ON ON THE SCIENCE OF

00:57:09.559 --> 00:57:10.426
HOW WE'RE GONNA.

00:57:10.493 --> 00:57:12.095
BUT START TO ADDRESS.

00:57:12.162 --> 00:57:14.230
THIS PROBLEM FACING OUR STATE

00:57:14.297 --> 00:57:14.531
THE FIRES.

00:57:14.597 --> 00:57:17.767
OF NOT ALL OF THE FIRE ISSUE --

00:57:17.834 --> 00:57:20.970
THE THE FORCED ISSUE -- CLIMATE

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.640
pWE'VE BEEN PASS AND BILLS AND

00:57:23.706 --> 00:57:24.908
WE'VE BEEN DOING OUR PART AND I

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:26.709
AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE HAS

00:57:26.776 --> 00:57:29.546
BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY FOR OVER

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:31.080
A DECADE. TO ADDRESS CLIMATE

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.149
CHANGE AND TO ADDRESS OUR

00:57:33.216 --> 00:57:36.186
QUALITY AND TO I DON'T DO THINGS

00:57:36.252 --> 00:57:37.687
DIFFERENTLY.

00:57:37.754 --> 00:57:38.888
BUT I THINK WE'VE BEEN LEADERS

00:57:38.955 --> 00:57:40.957
IN THE COUNTRY AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:41.524
OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S NOT

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:42.292
BACKING US UP.

00:57:42.358 --> 00:57:44.093
IN EVERY AREA WHEN WE'VE NEEDED

00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:45.128
HELP WITH -- MANAGING OUR

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:47.263
FORESTS EVEN FEDERALLY MANAGED

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.032
FORESTS THEY'RE NOT MANAGING.

00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:52.101
DOING WHAT'S WITHIN CLEARLY

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:52.535
THERE THEIR AREA OF

00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:53.603
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:55.271
AND SO WE ALMOST HAVE TO ACT

00:57:55.338 --> 00:57:56.973
ALONE IN THIS BECAUSE I DON'T

00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:57.941
SEE ANYTHING COMING FROM THE

00:57:58.007 --> 00:57:58.508
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP

00:57:58.575 --> 00:58:00.310
CALIFORNIA AND UNFORTUNATELY WE

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:01.177
SUBSIDIZE THE REST OF THE

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:02.745
COUNTRY.

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:05.181
WITH OUR TAXES AND WE DON'T SEE

00:58:05.248 --> 00:58:06.482
THOSE TAXES COME BACK TO OUR

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:07.650
STATE THAT'S JUST THE

00:58:07.717 --> 00:58:09.552
UNFORTUNATE PART.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.087
BUT IT WITH REGARD TO WHAT

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:11.721
YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER AND YOU

00:58:11.788 --> 00:58:12.755
KNOW THEIR TESTS TO BE A

00:58:12.822 --> 00:58:13.723
TENDENCY HERE IN THIS

00:58:13.790 --> 00:58:14.991
LEGISLATURE WHAT I'VE SEEN WHAT

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.125
WHENEVER WE PUT TOGETHER SOME

00:58:16.192 --> 00:58:17.460
KIND OF BOND.

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:19.562
OR SOME ON THE BUS SOLUTION TO A

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:21.531
PROBLEM THAT -- PEOPLE TEND TO

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:24.067
STICK IN THEIR PRIORITIES.

00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:25.401
AND THAT JUST THAT THAT JUST

00:58:25.468 --> 00:58:29.272
HAPPENS -- VERY ORGANICALLY HERE.

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.473
WHERE WHERE EVERYBODY JUST SAYS

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:31.374
WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT ABOUT MY

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.109
DISTRICT AND I GET THAT AND AND

00:58:33.176 --> 00:58:34.644
AND I'M HERE TO TO FIGHT FOR MY

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:35.478
DISTRICT AS WELL [inaudible]

00:58:35.545 --> 00:58:38.581
BUT I I'D LIKE TO SEE IS PUT

00:58:38.648 --> 00:58:40.483
TOGETHER BOND THAT IS BASED ON

00:58:40.550 --> 00:58:41.885
SCIENCE I MEAN THERE THERE ARE

00:58:41.951 --> 00:58:44.087
NUMEROUS NEEDS ACROSS THE STATE.

00:58:44.153 --> 00:58:45.321
BUT WHICH ONE IS GOING TO

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.156
MAXIMIZE OUR BOND DOLLAR BECAUSE

00:58:47.223 --> 00:58:48.558
WOULDN'T WORK WHEN WE'RE LOOKING

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:50.426
INTO THE FUTURE RIGHT NOW.

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:52.061
WE'RE GETTING TO THAT POINT.

00:58:52.128 --> 00:58:53.596
WHERE OUR STATE IS GOING TO BE

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:55.031
OVER LEVERAGE SOME BONDS WE'VE

00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:56.366
DONE A LOT OF BONDS?

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:57.967
AND AND TO VOTER INITIATIVES

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:59.269
WE'VE DONE BONDS [inaudible]

00:58:59.335 --> 00:59:01.704
AND AND THOSE BONDS ARE VERY

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:03.273
COSTLY.

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:04.707
AND IF WE SEE A DOWNTURN ARE

00:59:04.774 --> 00:59:06.376
BUDGET WHICH IS WHERE WE'RE

00:59:06.442 --> 00:59:07.944
APPROACHING THAT CYCLE WE'RE

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:10.179
GOING TO SEE OUR OUR OUR OUR

00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:12.081
REVENUES GO DOWN SHARPLY LIKE

00:59:12.148 --> 00:59:16.119
THEY DID IN. 220-009-2000.

00:59:16.185 --> 00:59:18.187
TEN OUR OUR DEBT.

00:59:18.254 --> 00:59:21.291
IN PROPORTION TO OUR REVENUE.

00:59:21.357 --> 00:59:24.560
RIGHT NOW IS IS PRETTY AVERAGE.

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.229
BUT IN A DOWNTURN THAT THAT

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:28.264
THAT'S GONNA THE PROPORTIONS CAN

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:30.133
INCREASE SHARPLY.

00:59:30.199 --> 00:59:32.535
ANY REDUCTION.

00:59:32.602 --> 00:59:37.006
IN IN OUR REVENUE IS GONNA MEAN.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:38.975
A DISPROPORTIONATE INCREASE IN

00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:41.210
ON TERMS OF THAT THE BURKE RATIO

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:43.112
WE HAVE TO BE VERY.

00:59:43.179 --> 00:59:44.814
CAREFUL TO THAT HE IS MINDFUL OF

00:59:44.881 --> 00:59:46.849
THAT INCLUDING PUTTING IN SOME

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.985
KIND OF MECHANISM. TO ALLOW

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:50.486
EITHER THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:59:50.553 --> 00:59:53.623
OFFICE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.224
TO NOT ISSUE A BOND.

00:59:55.291 --> 00:59:58.294
IN CASE OF EXTREME HARDSHIP.

00:59:58.361 --> 00:59:59.963
AND AND AND HAVING SOME KIND OF

01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:03.166
TRIGGER THAT ALLOWS US TO TO

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:04.901
FOREGO THAT THERE ARE STE THERE

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.502
ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT SHOULD

01:00:06.569 --> 01:00:09.839
SHOULD -- ALLOW US TO MANAGE OUR

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:11.274
FINANCES ONE INCLUDING IN.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:12.775
OUR IN OUR CREDIT RATING AND

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.410
WHAT THAT MEANS TO INTEREST

01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:17.113
RATES -- AND ANOTHER IS WHAT

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.748
WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ARE

01:00:18.815 --> 01:00:21.851
BUDGET GOES DOWN ARE WE TIED TO

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:22.819
HAVE INITIALLY.

01:00:22.885 --> 01:00:24.821
HAVING TO ISSUE BONDS AND IT AND

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:25.955
IT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT MEET

01:00:26.022 --> 01:00:28.758
MAY BECOME A NECESSITY BUT WE

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:30.827
NEED TO HAVE -- THAT RETAIN THAT

01:00:30.893 --> 01:00:32.462
DECISION MAKING POWER IN THE

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.197
LEGISLATURE TO THE SIDE SHOULD

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.431
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:39.335
ISSUE IN DEBT OR SHOULD WE CURB

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.271
THAT FOR NOW. TO TO BALANCE OUR

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.507
BUDGET THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.808
SOMETHING WE COULD CONSIDER BUT

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.543
GOING BACK TO THE SCIENCE.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:49.645
YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW CURRENTLY

01:00:49.712 --> 01:00:52.148
WHEN I READ I READ THIS I SEE

01:00:52.215 --> 01:00:52.448
[inaudible]

01:00:52.515 --> 01:00:54.684
THIS BOND.

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.653
AT ABOUT -- JUST UNDER FIVE

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.255
BILLION FOUR POINT.

01:00:59.322 --> 01:01:00.490
THREE BILLION DOLLARS WERE

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.692
TRYING TO SOLVE EVERY PROBLEM.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.760
I LOOK GO THROUGH THE LIST AND

01:01:03.826 --> 01:01:05.361
WORK WERE DRESSING SAFE DRINKING

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.229
WATER.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:07.430
WE'RE LOOKING AT GROUND WATER

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.464
MANAGEMENT.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:09.565
WE'RE LOOKING A STORM WATER

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:12.135
CAPTURE FOR ITS RESILIENCY OF

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.203
FOREST RESTORATION SEA LEVEL

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:16.339
RISE REDUCING.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.241
THE WILD FIRE RISK FLOOD

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:19.909
MANAGEMENT PROTECTION.

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:21.811
OF PROTECTING FIH AND WILDLIFE

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:25.415
RESTORING IMPACTED WATER BODIES

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:27.183
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.585
ARE VERY IMPORTANT.

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:30.853
BUT WHAT IS OUR PRIORITY RIGHT

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.989
NOW AND IF WE ARE GOING TO GO TO

01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:34.424
ISSUE IN THAT.

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:35.525
WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:01:35.591 --> 01:01:37.293
FOCUS ON A RE GONNA FOCUS ON

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.728
MAKING OUR STATE MORE RESILIENT

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:41.230
TO WILDFIRES?

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.699
OR WE GONNA OR WE GONNA.

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:45.668
SOLVE EVERY OTHER PROBLEM.

01:01:45.735 --> 01:01:47.136
ALONG WITH THAT AND REALLY NOT

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:49.205
DO EITHER.

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:50.873
MAYBE MAYBE THIS WILL HELP US TO

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:52.875
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:53.476
BUT IS THAT WHAT WE NEED RIGHT

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.877
NOW.

01:01:54.944 --> 01:01:56.179
RIGHT NOW SHOULD WE BE

01:01:56.245 --> 01:01:59.715
PRIORITIZING -- RESILIENCY I

01:01:59.782 --> 01:02:01.451
THINK THE MESSAGE FROM THE

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.653
LEGISLATURE TO THE VOTERS ARE WE

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:06.389
WILL IF WE ARE GOING TO BOND.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:07.023
IF WE ARE GOING TO GO DOWN THAT

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.124
ROUTE.

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:09.358
I THINK WE SHOULD.

01:02:09.425 --> 01:02:11.127
FOCUS.

01:02:11.194 --> 01:02:14.030
I THINK WE SHOULD DEVELOP A PLAN.

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.965
AND DEVELOP A VERY CLEAR

01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:17.366
STRATEGY WHO'S GOING TO

01:02:17.433 --> 01:02:19.268
IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN OR WE GONNA

01:02:19.335 --> 01:02:21.070
HAVE VARIOUS AGENCIES WORKING

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.839
INDEPENDENTLY TO FOCUS ON THEIR

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:23.906
OWN ISSUES.

01:02:23.973 --> 01:02:26.275
WHEN WE WILL WE DEVELOP SILOS IT

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.144
WEAKENS OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT

01:02:28.211 --> 01:02:29.846
OUR STRATEGY?

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.215
AND THAT'S THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS --

THE CENTER COVER EURO I THINK --

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.695
THEY BROUGHT OUT SOME ASSUME

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:21.230
SINCE SOME GOOD POINTS.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.099
I'LL I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE.

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.001
AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR CLIMATE

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.537
HAS -- ON BEEN UNDERGOING

01:03:27.603 --> 01:03:29.939
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AND TO THINK

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:31.674
OTHERWISE I THINK IS PUTTING

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.410
YOUR HEAD IN THE SAND -- SO I'M

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.645
GONNA PUT THAT OUT THERE.

AT THE OUTSET -- I DO LIKE THE

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:42.652
IDEA OF BUILDING A STRATEGY.

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.320
BASED ON SCIENCE BASED ON

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.155
PRIORITIES.

01:03:46.222 --> 01:03:47.523
SO I COMMEND -- YOUR YOUR

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.992

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.462
OUT WHAT'S WITH SUCH A LARGE

01:03:53.529 --> 01:03:55.164
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT -- THIS WOULD

01:03:55.231 --> 01:03:56.632
BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:03:56.699 --> 01:03:59.535
US TO DEVISE -- A COMPREHENSIVE

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:02.471
STRATEGY BASED ON THE INPUT OF

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:04.106
PERSONS MOST KNOWLEDGEABLE IN

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:06.609
THEIR RESPECTIVE FIELDS --

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.811
CREATING A LIST AND I THINK --

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:09.912
MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED THAT

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:12.415
EVERYONE OF US IS GOING TO SAY.

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:13.983
THIS IS A GREAT IDEA BUT LET'S

01:04:14.050 --> 01:04:15.651
TALK ABOUT MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:17.353
EVERY ONE OF US IS GOING TO HAVE --

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.322
A COMMONER -- TO LIKE THAT AND

01:04:19.388 --> 01:04:21.824
I'M NO DIFFERENT -- I BELIEVE

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.726
THAT -- THE THE AREA THAT I

01:04:23.793 --> 01:04:25.595
REPRESENT THE CENTRAL VALLEY --

01:04:25.661 --> 01:04:27.797
IS GROUND ZERO WHEN IT COMES TO

01:04:27.863 --> 01:04:29.565
AGRICULTURAL CHALLENGES WATER

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.933
INFRASTRUCTURE CHALLENGES SO ON

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.136
SO FORTH -- THAT'S WHY BEEN --

01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.739
SUCH A STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF THE

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.774
A REQUEST FOR FOUR MILLION

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.476
DOLLARS FOR FRANKLIN CAN NOW.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:43.145
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO TO TO

01:04:43.212 --> 01:04:46.515
YOU -- CENTER ALLEN IS THAT.

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:48.651
AS THIS MOVES ALONG -- I WOULD

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:51.387
LOVE TO SEE IF THERE IS A WAY TO

01:04:51.454 --> 01:04:55.358
DEVISE AN OVERARCHING STRATEGY --

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.059
FOR THE USE OF THESE DOLLARS --

01:04:57.126 --> 01:04:58.561
IN HOW THE ITERCONNECTS TO GIVE

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:00.129
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS THAT WOULD

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:01.731
BE ALLOCATED CERTAIN AMOUNTS TO

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.032
ADMINISTER.

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.700
HOW DO THEY ALL RELATE BECAUSE

01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:06.402
THERE ARE CERTAIN -- PROJECTS

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.938
THAT SHOULD HAVE HIGHER PRIORITY

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.107
BASED ON THE OBJECTIVE NEEDS OF

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.775
OF OF A GIVEN ISSUE.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:15.678
SO WHAT AT WHAT POINT IN THIS

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:16.245
PROCESS WOULD SOMETHING LIKE

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.280
THAT.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:17.847
BE POSSIBLE DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:20.383
IDEAS.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:22.351
WELL. TWO AND A EIGHT I THINK

01:05:22.418 --> 01:05:24.320
YOU'RE BOTH OF THE QUESTIONS OF

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:25.187
A FASTENER WESTERN CENTER BOARD

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:28.891
JUST DOVETAIL NICELY -- I WILL

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:30.192
SAY THAT THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:32.061
AMOUNTS THAT ARE -- THAT ARE

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:33.763
THAT ARE LAID OUT AND YOU CAN

01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:36.132
SEE THAT THE THAT THE MAIN FOCUS

01:05:36.198 --> 01:05:38.334
IS ON WILDFIRE RESILIENCY THERE

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.602
ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.837
THAT ARE RELATED AND AND AND AND

01:05:41.904 --> 01:05:42.838
VITALLY IMPORTANT -- BUT THAT IT

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:45.141
REALLY IS AT THE THE CORE OF THE

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:47.143
THE BOND I WILL SAY THAT TO SOME

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:50.046
EXTENT THIS IS ALSO A RESPONSE.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.781
TO THE FAILED ATTEMPTS -- THE

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:54.383
LAST ELECTION THAT IMPROPER --

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.117
THREE WHICH DID HAVE A NUMBER

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:56.719
WATER PROJECTS OTHER PROJECTS --

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.587
IT ROLLED INTO IT AND YET AND IF

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:01.357
YOU SEE IT IT DID WELL -- IT BUT

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.259
EVEN THOSE FOLKS WHO CAME OUT

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.560
SUPPORT.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:05.861
DID SO VERY RELUCTANTLY THERE

01:06:05.928 --> 01:06:08.130
WERE A LOT OF EDITORIAL BOARDS

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.699
IT REALLY -- OPENLY.

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.033
NOW WE'RE TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.368
SUPPORTED NOT BECAUSE IT LOOKED

01:06:12.435 --> 01:06:17.940
LIKE IT WAS SUCH A SUCH A

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:20.076
ENTREPRENEURIAL CHRISTMAS TREE --

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:20.810
AND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW

01:06:20.876 --> 01:06:22.244
BASICALLY GETTING VARIOUS FOLKS

01:06:22.311 --> 01:06:24.280
TO TO JOIN ON AND BE A PART OF

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:25.314
IT -- BECAUSE THEY KNEW THEY

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:25.981
WOULD GET THEIR LITTLE PIECE OF

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.550
PIPE BUT IT REALLY DIDN'T HAVE

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.085
ENOUGH OF A OVER ARCHING

01:06:29.151 --> 01:06:30.486
STRATEGY BEHIND IT.

01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:31.821
AND SO SO THESE ARE GREAT

01:06:31.887 --> 01:06:33.956
QUESTIONS AND I THINK ULTIMATELY

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.726
IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LIKE A

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.561
SMART.

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:40.062
AND AND AND KIND OF THOUGHT FULL.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:41.931
SENATE DIRECTION FROM FROM

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:43.499
LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND AND

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:46.102
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE -- IF IT'S IF

01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.170
IT'S IMPLEMENTED TO HELP. TO

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.372
BOTH DEAL WITH FISCAL PRUDENCE

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.941
ISSUES AND I THINK THAT WE

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:53.142
ABSOLUTE UP I KNOW IT BE BACK

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.243
YOU KNOW EIGHT OR NINE WE DIDN'T

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.311
ISSUE BONDS FOR EXAMPLE ON THE

01:06:55.378 --> 01:06:57.012
NATURAL BECAUSE OF THE THE

01:06:57.079 --> 01:06:57.546
DIFFICULT.

01:06:57.613 --> 01:06:59.115
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS BUT I DO

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:00.249
THINK WE GOT TO PUT SOME STRONG

01:07:00.316 --> 01:07:01.717
LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT ALLOWS

01:07:01.784 --> 01:07:03.252
FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND THE AND

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.354
THE GOVERNOR TO ADD TO TO NOT

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:06.322
ISSUE BONDS WHEN IT.

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:07.423
JUST DOESN'T MAKE FINANCIAL

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.059
SENSE WE WE GOT WITH THAT WE

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.394
OUGHT NOT HAVE A A KIND OF A A

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.262
ROCK HARD.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.030
YOU KNOW -- SET OF REQUIREMENTS

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:15.831
FOR ISSUANCE IT BECAUSE THERE'S

01:07:15.898 --> 01:07:16.932
CERTAIN TIMES WHEN THE MARKET

01:07:16.999 --> 01:07:18.601
CONDITIONS JUST DON'T LEND

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.570
THEMSELVES TO DOING SO -- SO

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.272
THAT THAT WE OUGHT TO PUT IN --

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:25.975
AND THEN AND THEN IN THE END OF

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:27.877
THE DAY THIS IS ABOUT.

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:30.513
I YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT

01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:31.814
THERE'S REAL COHERENCE AT THIS

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.015
AND THAT'S PART OF THIS

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:34.450
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND IT'S

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:35.584
ALSO GOING TO INVOLVE ME THIS

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.752
COMMITTEE IS A CRITICAL PART OF

01:07:36.819 --> 01:07:38.020
THAT PROCESS RIGHT THIS IS WHERE

01:07:38.087 --> 01:07:39.388
THERE'S EXPERTISE.

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.724
AND AND AND WORKING WITH OF

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.426
COUNTERPARTS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.528
OFFICE.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:46.695
TO YOU KNOW MAKE SURE THAT THERE

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:48.697
REALLY IS A KIND OF A STRATEGY

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.166
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY THAT THE

01:07:50.232 --> 01:07:52.535
THE BOND -- IS IS FORMULATED AND

01:07:52.601 --> 01:07:55.337
AND IT'S A IT'S A BIT OF A DANCE

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.639
IS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW GET.

01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.140
POLITICAL SUPPORT NOT ONLY

01:07:58.207 --> 01:07:59.675
WITHIN THIS BUILDING BUT THEN

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.211
OUT WITH THE VOTERS -- BUT PART

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:03.546
OF WHY I WANTED TO DO THIS WAS

01:08:03.612 --> 01:08:05.714
BECAUSE I SAW WHAT HAPPENED PROP

01:08:05.781 --> 01:08:07.483
THREE AND I SAW THE FACT THAT IT

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.617
WAS SO.

01:08:08.684 --> 01:08:11.654
THAT PROCESS WAS SO PROBLEMATIC

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:12.788
AND AND I MEAN IT WOULD BE A

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.623
THIS THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:15.991
ENOUGH TO COME MANAGE AND AND

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:18.060
WE'RE DOING THIS ALL TOGETHER AS

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:18.861
A AS A TEAM.

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:24.800
I THAT WAS A PARTICULARLY -- YOU

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:27.036
KNOW -- BE ENTREPRENEURIAL PROD

01:08:27.102 --> 01:08:31.106
PROCESS THAT THAT I THOUGHT

01:08:31.173 --> 01:08:34.677
TOO HAPHAZARD IN TERMS OF OF OF

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.278
ENGAGING PEOPLE AND NOT REALLY

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:37.546
HAPHAZARD IT WAS IT WAS A LITTLE

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.048
TOO OP IS MAYBE TO TRANSACTIONAL

01:08:39.114 --> 01:08:40.382
PERHAPS.

01:08:40.449 --> 01:08:42.318
AND SO I'M YOU GUYS ARE TOUCHING

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.152
ON ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:44.687
IT'S PART OF WHAT GAVE ME PAUSE

01:08:44.753 --> 01:08:46.021
WHEN I WAS CONSIDERING EVEN

01:08:46.088 --> 01:08:47.256
PROPOSING THIS.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.258
BECAUSE THESE GET BIG AND YOU

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:50.192
REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:08:50.259 --> 01:08:51.360
YOU BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; ULTIMATELY HAVE A&lt;/c&gt;

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.728
REAL IMPACT BOTH ON PUBLIC

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.531
HEALTH AND ON RESILIENCY.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:58.167
AND AND WE'VE TRIED TO CRAFTED

01:08:58.234 --> 01:08:59.435
IN A WAY THAT.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.303
IS COHERENT BUT BUT WE

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:03.639
ABSOLUTELY WELCOME THE THE THE

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.107
CONTINUAL ENGAGEMENT OF WHAT THE

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.408
COMMITTEE BUT EVERYONE OF THE

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:07.376
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THROUGH

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:08.677
THIS PROCESS.

01:09:08.744 --> 01:09:09.512
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.413
RIGHT I KNOW THAT'S A I I KNOW

01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:12.181
THAT'S NOT IT'S BE SPECIFIC

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:13.849
ANSWER YOU'RE LOOKING FOR BUT

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:15.117
IT'S A HARD.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.218
ONE TO HIS HEART YEAH SO HERE'S

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:18.821
MY UNABASHED PLUG FOR THE AREA

01:09:18.888 --> 01:09:23.626
THAT I REPRESENT OKAY -- PART OF

01:09:23.692 --> 01:09:25.694
THE PROBLEM SENATOR.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:26.729
SO I THINK.

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.364
WE HAVE A CONFIDENCE ISSUE -- IN

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:32.101
THE CENTRAL VALLEY -- ABOUT.

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:35.070
BEEN NICELY WORDED BONDS.

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:37.773
THAT -- ARE DESCRIPTIVE AND

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.109
EVERYONE CAN BUY INTO -- THE

01:09:40.175 --> 01:09:42.444
APPROPRIATENESS OF THEIR PASSAGE.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.513
AND WHAT HAPPENS IS -- WHEN THEY

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:48.083
GO TO A RESPECTIVE DEPARTMENT OR?

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.718
A BODY THAT IF MINISTERS THOSE

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.153
FUNDS.

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:53.222
THE SCIENCE GETS REALLY FUNNY.

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:55.291
AND I BELIEVE THAT SITE SHOULD

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:58.727
BE OUR OBJECTIVE IN IT SHOULD BE

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.996
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAX.

01:10:01.063 --> 01:10:02.298
BUT SOMETIMES INDIVIDUAL OR

01:10:02.364 --> 01:10:04.833
AREAS THAT WERE EXPECTING TO

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:06.335
RECEIVE DOLLARS.

01:10:06.402 --> 01:10:07.937
AND THIS GOES BACK TO WATER

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.538
INFRASTRUCTURE INTO WHETHER IT'S

01:10:09.605 --> 01:10:11.340
TEMPERANCE WHETHER IT'S RECHARGE

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.275
BASINS ARE SO ON AND SO FORTH.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:15.844
AND THERE IS CERTAIN REGIONS

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.112
JUST DON'T GET WHAT THEY'RE

01:10:17.179 --> 01:10:18.814
PROMISED EVEN WITH THE WEEK AND

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.115
THEN DODD IN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:22.217
PROCESS SO YOU CAN KIND OF SEE

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:23.586
WHERE SOME OF THE FOLKS IN THE

01:10:23.652 --> 01:10:24.887
CENTRAL VALLEY I WANT TO SPEAK

01:10:24.954 --> 01:10:26.221
FOR CENTER COPIER BUT YOU MIGHT

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:29.959
VERY WELL AGREE -- SO THAT'S WHY.

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.560
I BECOME MORE OF A FAN OF

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:34.563
ARTICULATING THE RECIPIENTS.

01:10:34.630 --> 01:10:37.566
AND THE THE AREAS IN THE WORDING

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.769
OF THE BOND SO WE CAN AVOID THE

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:44.273
AMBIGUITY OF OF OF WHAT THE REP

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:46.742
WITH THE RECIPIENT MIGHT BE IN

01:10:46.809 --> 01:10:48.043
THE IN THE LONG TERM -- BECAUSE

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.645
WE HAVE A WAY OF JUST KIND OF

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.313
CHANGING THAT OUT.

01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:53.215
WOULD YOU BE OPEN.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.150
TO IF THERE WERE MASTER STRATEGY.

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:57.186
BEING MORE SPECIFIC IN THE

01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.588
WORDING OF THE BOND WE'RE

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:02.458
RECIPIENT -- DOLLARS WOULD MOST

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:03.892
LIKELY GO.

01:11:03.959 --> 01:11:05.461
IT'S A TRICKY THING SENATOR AYE

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.062
AYE AYE DOUBTS WE HEAR YOU I'D

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:09.198
LOVE TO GET A BETTER SENSE AND

01:11:09.264 --> 01:11:09.765
OTHER.

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.100
MEN IF YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO SEE

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.434
IF YOU WANNA SAY IT NOW WHEN YOU

01:11:12.501 --> 01:11:13.135
SAY THE SCIENCE GETS FUNNY CAN

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:13.335
YOU.

01:11:13.402 --> 01:11:14.870
CLARIFY THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.538
SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND A USE

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.908
TEMPERATE FLIGHT AS AN EXAMPLE.

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.010
THE NOTION.

01:11:21.076 --> 01:11:22.344
OF THEM THE MODELING THAT WAS

01:11:22.411 --> 01:11:26.015
USED TO DETERMINE -- WE'RE THE

01:11:26.081 --> 01:11:27.549
WAS IT WAS A PROP.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:30.085
ONE PROP ONE FUNDING WAS GOING

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:31.887
TO GO FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE --

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:34.323
THE MODELING THAT DETERMINE THAT

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:36.191
BENEFICIAL USE WAS ONE OF THE

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.593
METRICS.

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:39.862
AND IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.163
STOMACH.

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.831
THE IDEA THAT.

01:11:42.898 --> 01:11:45.100
THE AGRICULTURAL REAPER -- AREA

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.002
OF THE VALLEY AND TO THE THE

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.837
INDIVIDUALS -- IN THE RURAL

01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:51.273
AREAS -- IN THE NEED FOR CLEAN

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:52.041
DRINKING WATER SO ON AND SO

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:54.977
FORTH WE'RE NOT VIEWED UPON AS A

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.846
BOB AND OFFICIALS USE OF COURSE.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.482
BLEW OUR MINDS ARE EVEN THOUGH

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.550
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.452
CLEARLY INVOLVED IN THE

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:05.587
SUCCESSFUL PASSAGE OF THAT --

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:08.057
WERE ANTICIPATING THAT -- THE

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.525
VALLEY WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:10.793
RECEIVE INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THAT

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.961
SO THAT I USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:15.030
THAT THE SCIENCE IS THERE BUT

01:12:15.097 --> 01:12:17.599
THE MODELING HE TENDS TO HAVE

01:12:17.666 --> 01:12:19.501
THE GOAL POST MOVE OVER TIME.

01:12:19.568 --> 01:12:21.236
THAT ONE'S BEEN TOO MUCH TIME

01:12:21.303 --> 01:12:23.105
YEAH NO I AM SO MAYBE A CASE

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:23.906
LIKE THAT MAYBE MAYBE WHEN WE

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:25.340
TALK ABOUT SPECIFICITY MAYBE

01:12:25.407 --> 01:12:27.176
MAYBE THE ANSWER IS TO TO REALLY

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.811
PUT IN SPECIFICITY WITH REGARDS

01:12:28.877 --> 01:12:30.145
TO CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND AND

01:12:30.212 --> 01:12:31.714
YOU KNOW I'M AND UNDERSERVED

01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.715
COMMUNITIES AGRICULTURAL

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:33.315
COMMUNITY SO.

01:12:33.382 --> 01:12:34.516
WE CAN USE THE GENERAL LANGUAGE

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.118
BUT STILL SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:37.920
ABLE TO TO GET TO THE CORE OF

01:12:37.986 --> 01:12:39.221
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.522
YES SO IT ALL IT FINISHES

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:41.523
BECAUSE I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE. TO

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.624
THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.427
WATER SUPPLY AND WATER QUALITY --

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.395
BY LIKE THAT.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:50.632
TYPE OF SPECIFICITY -- WITHIN

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:52.067
THAT.

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:52.935
DID YOU ENVISION OPERATIONS AND

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:54.036
MAINTENANCE INTO THE

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:55.003
CONSERVANCY'S AT ALL THROUGHOUT

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.940
THE STATE.

01:12:58.006 --> 01:12:58.941
YEAH WE'RE NOT -- THAT'S

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.509
ELIGIBLE AT AHLERS AT NOT

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:02.578
INELIGIBLE USES TO BE SORT OF

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:03.679
OKAY TIME BY THAT I WILL FINISH

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:06.815
MY PLUG -- ON THAT ON THAT POINT.

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.250

01:13:50.793 --> 01:13:51.727
OF CORE.

01:13:51.794 --> 01:13:54.096
ISSUES INFRASTRUCTURAL AND AND

01:13:54.163 --> 01:13:55.531
INFORMAL JUSTICE ISSUES A YEAR

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.099

THEY SURROUND MOST OF MY

01:14:11.046 --> 01:14:13.348

THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEES

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:52.087
AND THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I THINK

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.789
WE CAN GET A LOT OF IT DONE THIS

01:14:53.856 --> 01:14:54.289
YEAR.

01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.824
I I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.960
REGARDING THE BONDING AS HAS

01:14:58.026 --> 01:14:59.494
BEEN MENTIONED -- YOU KNOW BOTH

01:14:59.561 --> 01:15:00.863
GOVERNOR BROWN AND GOVERNOR'S

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.269
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY I DON'T

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.170
KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.539
OR NOT -- BUT IF IT DOES THAT

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.807
WILL IMPACT THE BONDING

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:16.378
CAPABILITY -- AND AND I REALLY

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.646

I'M JUST KINDA UNCOMFORTABLE --

01:15:34.263 --> 01:15:35.530
PUTTING THE STATE FURTHER IN

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.399
DEBT ARE AUTHORIZING YOU KNOW

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:39.902

ULTIMATELY THIS IS.

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:57.619
THE BEGINNING OF A LONG

01:15:57.686 --> 01:15:58.687
CONVERSATION THROUGH THE

LEGISLATURE AND AND WE AWARE

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:01.990

TRYING TO ADDRESS HERE ARE

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:28.684
PRICING IN REAL AN URGENT.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.319

HEY WE HAVE A MOTION FROM CENTER

FUNDING.

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.564
FRANKLY I HAVE A OF THE MATERIAL

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:17.499
HOW IT'S ACTUALLY THE

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:19.468
INTERNATIONAL SYMBOL OF OBSOLETE

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:22.237
DAM REMOVAL MOVEMENT WE'VE BEEN

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.772
TRYING TO GET THAT REMOVED -- I

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:25.707
THINK IT WAS WHEN SECRETARY

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:28.377
BABBITT WAS THE HEAD OF THE

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.278
INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.981
OF MANY MANY YEARS AGO -- CAME

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:35.984
UP AND SYMBOLICALLY REMOVED ONE

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:37.119
OF THE CONCRETE.

01:17:37.185 --> 01:17:40.989
TO BORDERS AND THAT'S ABOUT ALL

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:41.757
THE TO EVER HAPPEN.

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:44.526
AND SO IT'S MY HOPE THAT -- THAT

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:47.462
THIS WOULD ALSO BE -- CERTAINLY

01:17:47.529 --> 01:17:49.498
ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION IT

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.400
ISN'T RIGHT NOW -- IT WILL

01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:54.236
RESTORE THE VENTURA RIVER --

01:17:54.302 --> 01:17:56.705
IMPROVING OUR RECREATION RIVER

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.206
HEALTH FISH STOCKS COASTAL

01:17:58.273 --> 01:17:59.307
HEALTH I MEAN THERE WERE A LOT

01:17:59.374 --> 01:18:01.243
OF GOOD REASONS THAT THIS MIGHT

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:02.277
BE INCLUDED.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:05.280
AND IT'S ACTUALLY A VITAL.

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.315
OF RESTORATION PROJECT BUT A

01:18:07.382 --> 01:18:09.618
TRUSTING AGAIN SEALEVEL RISE SO --

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.386
WOULD THIS BE SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.755
WOULD BE WILLING TO ADD TO THE

01:18:13.822 --> 01:18:16.958
BILL -- AGAIN AS ONE OF THE

01:18:17.025 --> 01:18:18.527
OPTIONS I DON'T THINK.

01:18:18.593 --> 01:18:20.695
IT'S FAIR TO JUST ASK YOU TO PUT

01:18:20.762 --> 01:18:22.431
YOU KNOW TO PUT THIS CHRISTMAS

01:18:22.497 --> 01:18:28.336
TREE OUT THERE WITH SPECIFIC --

01:18:28.403 --> 01:18:29.704
PROJECTS BUT CERTAINLY WITHIN

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.373
THE SUBJECT MATTER OF OBSOLETE

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:32.741
DANCE I WOULD.

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:34.042
VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT IF YOU

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:35.410
WOULD CONSIDER THAT SO WE COULD

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:38.280
BID FORD AND BEFORE PEOPLE.

01:18:38.346 --> 01:18:39.614
THE THE WERE ALIVE WHEN

01:18:39.681 --> 01:18:41.316
SECRETARY BABBITT WAS A SECTOR

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.251
NO LONGER LIVE SO THEY HAVE NO

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.187
IDEA WHAT I'M REFERRING -- TO

01:18:45.253 --> 01:18:46.655
IT'S SORT OF LIKE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:48.890
TODAY DON'T KNOW JUDY COLLINS IS

01:18:48.957 --> 01:18:52.060

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:53.061
SAID GENERATION.

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:57.799
AND YES SEAT NOT ARGUING ALL FOR

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:58.467
DON'T YOU CAN YOU CAN'T KID MAKE

01:18:58.533 --> 01:18:59.901
BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:02.204
COULD ALSO CONSIDER THOSE

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:03.872
ASPECTS AS PART OF IT IS WHAT.

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:05.307
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT MY

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.008
ASSESSMENT HAS FOR YEARS AND

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.977
THAT THAT THAT'S THE PLAN. TO

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.745
PROTECT CONVERSION OPTION.

01:19:10.812 --> 01:19:12.013
YEAH VERY GOOD.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.682
THANK YOU MEMBERS FOR THE ROBUST

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.684

BELABOR THIS BUT I APPRECIATE.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:20.555
THEM.

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:21.356
YOUR DEXTERITY AND SORT OF

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:21.957
OPENNESS TO THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:19:22.023 --> 01:19:24.092
TO MAKE THIS.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.661
THIS KIND OF BOND PERFORM.

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:28.130
BUT I DO WANT TO RESET THE

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.232
CONVERSATION TO THAT.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.800
THE RISK IS STILL GOING TO BE

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:34.236
TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT

01:19:34.302 --> 01:19:35.871
THIS IS NOT EVEN GOING TO BE A

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.772
DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.207
THE SCOPE OF THE RISKS OF THIS

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.209
STATE RIGHT EVEN OVER THE LIFE

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:42.277
OF THIS BOX.

01:19:42.344 --> 01:19:44.112
THERE A LOT OF OTHER WAYS TO PAY

01:19:44.179 --> 01:19:45.780
FOR THIS STUFF TOO WE'RE GONNA

01:19:45.847 --> 01:19:47.182
NEED ALL THOSE WAYS.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:48.984
THE RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA BEAR

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:50.285
SOME OF THE RISK ON WILDFIRE.

01:19:50.352 --> 01:19:51.853
HOW MUCH CAN THEY BEAR?

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:52.754
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.256
BEAR THE COSTS OF EMERGENCY

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:56.057
SERVICES AND YOU KNOW DEALING

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:59.628
WITH FLOODED HOMES AND TRYING TO

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:01.396
YOU KNOW DREDGE UP UNDER BRIDGE

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.330
THAT YOU CAN GET.

01:20:02.397 --> 01:20:03.598
SEVEN FLOOD YOU KNOW WATER

01:20:03.665 --> 01:20:05.233
MOVING THROUGH THERE IN A IN A

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:06.902
IN A CRISIS AVOIDING LIABILITIES

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:09.371
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:09.871
OF LIABILITIES THE LOCAL

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:11.439
GOVERNMENT.

THE FARMING COMMUNITY I MEAN IT

01:20:13.542 --> 01:20:15.177
THE LIST GOES ON I THINK.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:17.379
MAIN MY GOAL WOULD BE THAT.

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:19.814
WE CONTINUE NOT JUST TO TO WORK

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:20.448
TOGETHER WITH THE MEMBERS THIS

01:20:20.515 --> 01:20:23.618
COMMITTEE -- BUT TO REALLY PUT

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:25.754
AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK TOGETHER

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:27.989
THAT'S GOING TO GIVE THAT SENSE

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.058
OF PERFORMANCE HERE THAT I THINK.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:32.027
WE CAN PROBABLY FIND.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:34.196
A MULTI REGIONAL BI PARTISAN

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:36.298
ANSWER HERE THAT WE DON'T WANT

01:20:36.364 --> 01:20:37.699
TO OVER INFLATE WHAT THIS IS

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:40.001
GONNA SOLVE EITHER BECAUSE AGAIN

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:41.603
I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN AFFORD TO

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:42.904
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM RIGHT NOW BUT

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:44.139
A BOND.

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:45.473
IS IT IS AN ISSUANCE OF TRUST

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.841
AND IT'S SAYING THAT WE RIGHT

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.677
NOW IN PRESENT DAY CAN'T AFFORD

01:20:48.743 --> 01:20:50.912
THE SCOPE OF THIS RACE BUT WE'RE

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:51.479
GONNA MAKE A PROMISE TO THE

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:52.447
FUTURE.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:53.348
THE PEOPLE LIVING CALIFORNIA SAY

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:55.684
LIKE WE ALL COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:56.918

YEARS THIRTY YEARS?

01:21:03.191 --> 01:21:05.961
I THINK SPEAKING ON HIS BEHALF

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:07.963
IS FAIR IN THIS CASE BECAUSE

01:21:08.029 --> 01:21:09.064
EVEN THOUGH.

01:21:09.130 --> 01:21:10.732

01:21:14.169 --> 01:21:15.904
THAT VOICE HAS TO COME THROUGH

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:17.539
TO SO YEAH EVERYTHING JUST

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:18.907
BURNED OUT.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.302
TIMING WISE I THINK WE WOULD

HAVE TO WAIT -- WELL TO TO THE

01:22:56.871 --> 01:22:58.540
END OF THE PROCESS FOR ANOTHER

01:22:58.606 --> 01:23:00.408
REFERRAL BUT I THINK THE POINT

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.344
IS THAT WE DO WE COMMIT TO A A

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:04.679
SUBSTANTIVE HEARING NOT JUST A A

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:06.681
A A SORT OF WE WOULD WE WOULD

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.416
TAKE THE REFERRAL FROM RULES AND

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:09.718
HEAR THIS AGAIN.

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.486
BUT WHETHER THAT OCCURS BEFORE A

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:16.891
FLOOR VOTE -- OR AFTER THE OTHER

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:19.561
HOUSE -- I DON'T KNOW.

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:20.161
AFTER THE OTHER HOUSE SO WOULD

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:20.829
IT WOULD BE IF IF THIS WERE TO

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:21.796
MOVE THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WE

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:23.198
WOULD SEE THIS BACK.

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.933
OKAY SO I THINK THAT'S THE TIME

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:27.135
IS THIS IS THE POLICY HEARING IN

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:29.237
THIS HOUSE BUT WE WOULD CALL IT

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:30.505
BACK FOR A POLICY HEARING IF IT

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:31.840
MADE IT OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY.

01:23:31.906 --> 01:23:34.242
HOWEVER I DON'T I ALSO THINK

01:23:34.309 --> 01:23:36.411
BEFORE APPROPRIATIONS THE FLOOR

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:37.679
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:39.314

KIND OF GROUP TOGETHER AND START.

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.154
REALLY WORKING ON THIS BUT I

01:23:46.221 --> 01:23:48.089
THINK THAT'S THE FORMAL PROCESS.

01:23:48.156 --> 01:23:51.192
THAT IS THAT HELPFUL.

01:23:51.259 --> 01:23:52.994
AND I THINK RATING AT THE END OF

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.295
TRYING TO I'M TRYING TO MAKE

01:23:54.362 --> 01:23:55.397
SURE I UNDERSTAND.

THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD AND

01:23:58.466 --> 01:23:59.734
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE

01:23:59.801 --> 01:24:01.469
BEEN RAISED HERE.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.005
THEY WOULD BE INCORPORATED OR

TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS THIS

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.863
MORNING -- SO SURVEYS WERE

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.732
DEVELOPED BY DOCTOR JAMES EACH

01:53:25.798 --> 01:53:29.169
CHURCH BEGINNING IN NINETEEN OH

01:53:29.235 --> 01:53:30.904
NINE TO MAKE POSSIBLE FORECASTS

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.405
OF SUBSEQUENT SPRING RUN OFF.

01:53:32.472 --> 01:53:34.474
OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST RUNOFF

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.743
HAS MADE FOR MORE EFFICIENT USE

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:39.379
OF EXISTING RESERVOIR CAPACITY.

01:53:39.445 --> 01:53:40.947
FOR BOTH WATER SUPPLY FLOOD

01:53:41.014 --> 01:53:42.916
CONTROL ENVIRONMENTAL RELEASES

01:53:42.982 --> 01:53:45.718
AND HYDROELECTRIC GENERATION.

01:53:45.785 --> 01:53:47.287
DURING SUBSEQUENT YEARS

01:53:47.353 --> 01:53:48.888
EVOLUTIONARY IMPROVEMENTS WERE

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:51.057
MADE TO IMPROVE THEIR TIMING AND

01:53:51.124 --> 01:53:53.626
ACCURACY OF SNOW MEASUREMENTS

01:53:53.693 --> 01:53:55.128
AND RUN OFF FOR CASH.

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:56.963
CURRENT OPERATIONAL WATER SUPPLY

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:59.332
FORECASTING RELIES ON THESE

01:53:59.399 --> 01:54:00.800
GROUND BASED MEASUREMENTS.

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:02.769
THE EXISTING NETWORK OF SNOW

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:05.371
COURSES AND SNOW SENSORS IS VERY

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:08.341
SPARSE AND CANNOT CAPTURE.

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:10.843
THE TERRAIN AND TURN COLD --

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.145
VERY ABILITY OF SNOW

01:54:12.212 --> 01:54:13.913
ACCUMULATION AND MELT AND

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:17.750
THEREFORE ARE ONLY AN INDEX OF

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:18.851
THE SHOW IN A GIVEN AREA.

01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:20.153
EXISTING RUNOFF FORECASTING

01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:22.488
REALIZE EITHER ON A STATISTICAL

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:25.024
LIKE AN INDEX METHOD OR ON A

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:27.493
PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL RELATING

01:54:27.560 --> 01:54:30.163
VARIOUS VARIABLES TO THE SPRING

01:54:30.230 --> 01:54:31.364
RUN OFF.

01:54:31.431 --> 01:54:33.499
THE INDEX METHOD IS ATTRACTIVE

01:54:33.566 --> 01:54:34.701
BECAUSE OF ITS RELATIVE

01:54:34.767 --> 01:54:38.571
SIMPLICITY BUT IT SUFFERS THE

01:54:38.638 --> 01:54:40.340
THREE DIFFICULTIES IT DOESN'T

01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:42.875
WORK THAT WELL IN VERY WET OR

01:54:42.942 --> 01:54:44.310
VERY DRY CONDITIONS.

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:46.246
AND FURTHER MAKES THE ASSUMPTION

01:54:46.312 --> 01:54:48.715
THAT THE CLIMATE IS STATIONARY

01:54:48.781 --> 01:54:50.183
AND AGAIN WE KNOW THAT'S

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:53.119
UNSERVED AND PROVE CHAU OUR OUR

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:54.854
FORECASTS ARE INCREASINGLY MORE

01:54:54.921 --> 01:54:57.090
DIFFICULT AND LESS ACCURATE THAN

01:54:57.156 --> 01:54:58.825
THEY HAD BEEN IN THE PAST.

01:54:58.891 --> 01:55:00.193
THE PHYSICALLY BASED MODEL

01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:02.295
ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS SOME OF

01:55:02.362 --> 01:55:03.463
THOSE DEFICIENCIES.

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:07.500
BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE PRIMARY

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:10.169
DRIVER -- FOR THE SPRING RUN OF

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:11.170
THESE COURSES SNOW PACK AND THE

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:13.373
FOOD THAT WE CANNOT VALIDATE

01:55:13.439 --> 01:55:15.942
WITH CURRENT TECHNIQUES THE

01:55:16.009 --> 01:55:19.312
COMPUTER VALUE OF THE MODEL.

01:55:19.379 --> 01:55:20.580
I'VE BEEN MEASURING SNOW IN

01:55:20.647 --> 01:55:22.048
CALIFORNIA FOR NEARLY FORTY

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.583
YEARS AND THE AIRBORNE SNOW

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:26.219
OBSERVATORY IS A GAME CHANGER

01:55:26.286 --> 01:55:27.420
FOR SNOW PACK MEASUREMENT.

01:55:27.487 --> 01:55:28.788
AND THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:55:28.855 --> 01:55:30.290
DEVELOPMENT IN THE HISTORY OF

01:55:30.356 --> 01:55:32.492
SNOW SURVEYS. TO PARAPHRASE A

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.027
QUOTE FROM THE MOVIE MEN IN

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:36.562
BLACK BEFORE A A SHOW YOU

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:37.230
THOUGHT YOU KNEW ABOUT THE SNOW

01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.532
PACK NOW IMAGINE WHAT YOU'LL

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:41.000
KNOW TOMORROW.

01:55:41.067 --> 01:55:42.435
IT IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE HAD

01:55:42.502 --> 01:55:44.103
AN ACCURATE MEASUREMENT OF THE

01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:46.105
TOTAL VOLUME STILL VOLUME AND

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:48.775
DISTRIBUTION OVER A LARGE AREA.

01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:50.343
THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:52.145
BECAUSE IT DEFINES A QUANTITY OF

01:55:52.211 --> 01:55:54.681
RUN OFF INTO A GIVEN REG FOR

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:56.282
WITH VERY HIGH ACCURACY.

01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:58.618
AND ALLOWS WATER MANAGERS MUCH

01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:01.421
GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN ADJUSTING

01:56:01.487 --> 01:56:04.490
THE QUALITY AT THE TIMING AND

01:56:04.557 --> 01:56:05.491
THE QUANTITY OF THEIR RELEASES.

01:56:05.558 --> 01:56:07.760
IT IS ALSO NOW POSSIBLE TO

01:56:07.827 --> 01:56:09.062
VALIDATE MODELED SNOW PACK

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:11.264

01:56:11.331 --> 01:56:13.966
OTHER MODELS FOR EXAMPLE RELATED

01:56:14.033 --> 01:56:14.967
CLIMATE CHANGE.

01:56:15.034 --> 01:56:16.602
THE AIR SO IS MUCH MORE THAN

01:56:16.669 --> 01:56:18.204
JUST ABOUT WATER SMELLING FUND

01:56:18.271 --> 01:56:19.439
CONTROL.

01:56:19.505 --> 01:56:21.074
THE DATA SETS HAVE TREMENDOUS

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:23.109
UTILITY OVER A BROAD RANGE OF

01:56:23.176 --> 01:56:25.511
DISCIPLINES INCLUDING HABITAT

01:56:25.578 --> 01:56:28.915

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:23.970
IS IT'S FROM THE WALL ME ALL THE

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:26.239
WAY DOWN THE KOREA IS CURRENTLY

01:57:26.305 --> 01:57:27.840
BEING SURVEYED THIS YEAR.

01:57:27.907 --> 01:57:29.709
AND THAT INCLUDES WATER USERS

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:30.810
THAT ARE BENEFITING FROM THE

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:33.179
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO -- AND

01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:34.580
FROM AGRICULTURAL LANDS FROM

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:35.415
MERCED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO

01:57:35.481 --> 01:57:37.517
BAKERSFIELD -- THE WATER

01:57:37.583 --> 01:57:38.785
MANAGERS SHARE SEVERAL

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.353
CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA AND

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:41.854
STATEWIDE -- THEY NEED TO

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:42.889
BALANCE THE RISK OF FLOOD

01:57:42.955 --> 01:57:44.957
CONTROL WITH WATER SUPPLY AND

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:46.225
ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS --

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:47.794
PARTICULARLY ON THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.928
FOR THE THE FRIEND VISION WE'RE

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:49.762
CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:57:49.829 --> 01:57:51.297
IMPLEMENTATION OF RESTORATION

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:53.800
PROGRAM ON SAN JOAQUIN RIVER --

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.902
PARTICULAR FOR FRANK DIVISION

01:57:55.968 --> 01:57:56.536
WERE LOOKING CONJUNCTIVE

01:57:56.602 --> 01:57:58.604
MANAGEMENT AND ARE THE TRYING TO

01:57:58.671 --> 01:58:00.540
VISION WAS DEVELOPED TO TAKE

01:58:00.606 --> 01:58:01.941
EPISODIC FLOWS OFF OF THE SAN

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:03.309
JOAQUIN RIVER.

01:58:03.376 --> 01:58:04.677
AND RECHARGE GROUNDWATER AND I

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.078
WAS A DESIGN THAT WAS

01:58:06.145 --> 01:58:06.646
IMPLEMENTED IN THE NINETEEN

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:07.847
FORTIES.

01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:09.048
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:10.550
TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH SNOW

01:58:10.616 --> 01:58:11.417
THERE IS AND WHEN IT'S RUNNING

01:58:11.484 --> 01:58:12.251
OFF.

01:58:12.318 --> 01:58:15.688
AND TO DO THAT WITH ADDITIONAL

01:58:15.755 --> 01:58:19.859
BURDENS OF YOU KNOW.

01:58:19.926 --> 01:58:20.893
SIGMA IMPLEMENTATION -- WITH

01:58:20.960 --> 01:58:21.727
RESTORATION AND TRYING TO MANAGE

01:58:21.794 --> 01:58:23.429
THAT WATER SUPPLIES WE HAVE FOR

01:58:23.496 --> 01:58:24.797
THE ENVIRONMENT MORE EFFECTIVELY.

01:58:24.864 --> 01:58:26.399
IT'S CREATING AS A SYSTEM IN

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:28.534
WHICH THE X. EXPENSIVE MISTAKES

01:58:28.601 --> 01:58:30.069
OF TAKING A CONSERVATIVE

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.405
APPROACH UNDER WATER SUPPLY.

01:58:32.472 --> 01:58:33.806
LOSES BIG OPPORTUNITIES.

01:58:33.873 --> 01:58:35.208
AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF ANECDOTES

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.243
THAT WE'VE ALREADY -- COLLECTED

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:38.311
THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:58:38.377 --> 01:58:39.679
THE LAST SEVEN YEARS THE TALL ME

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:41.380
WAS THE FIRST WATERSHED OUT OF

01:58:41.447 --> 01:58:42.582
THE GATE. TO SEE THIS

01:58:42.648 --> 01:58:44.016
IMPLEMENTED SO THEY'VE GOT SEVEN

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.351
YEARS OF PRACTICE.

01:58:45.418 --> 01:58:46.919
THIS TECHNOLOGY'S COMPLETELY

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.421
BAKED INTO HOW THEY'RE DOING

01:58:48.488 --> 01:58:49.822
WATER MANAGEMENT TODAY.

01:58:49.889 --> 01:58:52.592
AND LAST YEAR AND TWENTY

01:58:52.658 --> 01:58:54.427
EIGHTEEN AS SO SAVED A HUNDRED

01:58:54.494 --> 01:58:56.128
AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET

01:58:56.195 --> 01:58:58.231
FROM BEING SPILT THEIR WARES AND

01:58:58.297 --> 01:58:58.931
ENCOURAGEMENT INTO THE FLOOD

01:58:58.998 --> 01:58:59.899
POCKET.

01:58:59.966 --> 01:59:01.467
AND THEY WERE BEING ASKED AT

01:59:01.534 --> 01:59:02.935
DAWN PETER TO EVACUATE THAT

01:59:03.002 --> 01:59:05.872
WATER SENT DOWN THE RIVER AND

01:59:05.938 --> 01:59:06.839
MAKE SPACE FOR MORE RAIN.

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:08.074
WITH A SO THEY KNEW HOW MUCH

01:59:08.140 --> 01:59:09.208
WATER WAS ON THE GROUND THEY

01:59:09.275 --> 01:59:10.276
KNEW THAT THERE'S NO WAY IF IT

01:59:10.343 --> 01:59:11.611
ALL MELTED THAT THEY WOULD SPILL

01:59:11.677 --> 01:59:12.879
A DROP.

01:59:12.945 --> 01:59:13.646
AND THEY COULD SEE THAT THERE

01:59:13.713 --> 01:59:14.814
WEREN'T ANY ATMOSPHERE COVERS ON

01:59:14.881 --> 01:59:17.550
THE HORIZON THEY WERE COMPELLED

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:18.885
TO SHARE THAT AND THEY WERE ABLE

01:59:18.951 --> 01:59:20.353
TO SAVE THAT WATER THAT'S WATER

01:59:20.419 --> 01:59:22.355
THAT THAT GOES INTO GROUND WATER

01:59:22.421 --> 01:59:22.522
NOW.

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:25.124
AND KEEPS THE VALLEY PRODUCTIVE --

01:59:25.191 --> 01:59:27.260
ON THE FRIEND SYSTEM WE INVESTED

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:29.428
IN AND TRYING TO GET A A SO INTO

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:30.730
THE SAN JOAQUIN OUT OF THE

01:59:30.796 --> 01:59:32.131
TWELVE AS A FIRST STEP BECAUSE

01:59:32.198 --> 01:59:32.765
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:33.866
DROUGHT.

01:59:33.933 --> 01:59:35.835
AND WE WERE HAVING ALLOCATIONS

01:59:35.902 --> 01:59:38.271
THAT WERE 10% BELOW WHAT THEY

01:59:38.337 --> 01:59:39.805
ULTIMATELY COULD HAVE BEEN.

01:59:39.872 --> 01:59:41.340
AND IT'S IMPORTANT 10% IN A

01:59:41.407 --> 01:59:43.175
CRITICAL DROUGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:59:43.242 --> 01:59:44.977
FOLLOWING LAND OR YOU'RE DOING

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.812
UNNECESSARY GROUNDWATER PUMPING

01:59:46.879 --> 01:59:48.147
IN A DRY YEAR WHEN YOU COULD

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:49.849
HAVE HAD THE KNOWLEDGE OF HOW

01:59:49.916 --> 01:59:51.083
MUCH SNOW THAT WS ON THE GROUND.

01:59:51.150 --> 01:59:53.953
SO THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT DRY.

01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:55.821
WHAT YEAR AVERAGE YEAR PRODUCES

01:59:55.888 --> 01:59:57.290
OPPORTUNITIES TO MANAGE OUR

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:59.992
WATER RESOURCES A A LOT BETTER --

02:00:00.059 --> 02:00:02.895
THROUGHOUT THE STATE -- I'LL

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:05.698
JUST ADD THAT AID IT ADDS A SOME

02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:07.533
CONFIDENCE AND FLOOD MANAGEMENT --

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.201
THIS YEAR I WAS JUST SPEAKING

02:00:09.268 --> 02:00:09.835
WITH WATER MASS FROM THE KINGS

02:00:09.902 --> 02:00:10.836
RIVER.

02:00:10.903 --> 02:00:12.171
AND HE WAS SAYING THAT THE THE

02:00:12.238 --> 02:00:13.639
NEW SERVICE THAT WE ARE JUST

02:00:13.706 --> 02:00:15.841
GETTING OUT OVER EMAIL THIS WEEK

02:00:15.908 --> 02:00:17.310
HAVE GIVEN HIM THE CONFIDENCE TO

02:00:17.376 --> 02:00:19.445
BE ABLE TO RELEASE FLOOD CONTROL

02:00:19.512 --> 02:00:21.180
IN A MORE MODERATED -- MANNER

02:00:21.247 --> 02:00:22.949
RIGHT NOW SO HE'S MAKING

02:00:23.015 --> 02:00:24.216
ADDITIONAL RELEASES WITH THE

02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:24.984
CONFIDENCE THAT THE RESERVOIR

02:00:25.051 --> 02:00:26.852
WILL REFUND LATER AND THAT THIS

02:00:26.919 --> 02:00:28.321
IS GOING TO AVOID A SURPRISE

02:00:28.387 --> 02:00:29.589
LATER IN THE SEASON.

02:00:29.655 --> 02:00:31.057
AND THE SURPRISES ARE EXPENSIVE

02:00:31.123 --> 02:00:32.425
FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE YOU

02:00:32.491 --> 02:00:33.926
END UP WITH THESE MODULATED

02:00:33.993 --> 02:00:35.194
POLLS FLOWS THAT ARE ARE

02:00:35.261 --> 02:00:37.063
SOMETIMES DESTRUCTIVE TO HABITAT

02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:40.600
YOU'RE TRYING. TO TO RESTORE

02:00:40.666 --> 02:00:42.201
THANK YOU.

02:00:42.268 --> 02:00:42.602
THANKS SIR.

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:43.769
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING

02:00:43.836 --> 02:00:44.804
ME TO SPEAK TODAY THE DAVIS

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:46.472
BOARD MEMBER FOR THE MONO LAKE

02:00:46.539 --> 02:00:47.139
COMMITTEE IN THE VERY LONG

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:48.407
DISTANT PAST.

02:00:48.474 --> 02:00:49.742
IT WAS ALSO THE EXECUTIVE

02:00:49.809 --> 02:00:50.876
DIRECTOR.

02:00:50.943 --> 02:00:52.211
BUT WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT IN

02:00:52.278 --> 02:00:53.379
CONCEPT ON THIS BILL WE'RE

02:00:53.446 --> 02:00:55.014
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE

02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:57.183
SPONSORS ON SOME MINOR TECHNICAL

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.918
AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY SOME OF

02:00:58.985 --> 02:01:00.353
THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL.

02:01:00.419 --> 02:01:01.887
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE EXPLAINED THE

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:04.390
TECHNOLOGY I THINK VERY WELL IN

02:01:04.457 --> 02:01:05.391
MANY OF THE USES.

02:01:05.458 --> 02:01:06.325
SO.

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:08.894
I JUST WANT TO TESTIFY AS A USER

02:01:08.961 --> 02:01:09.729
OF THE STATE -- WE WILL MODEL

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:11.430
LIKE COMMITTEE WAS INCLUDED VERY

02:01:11.497 --> 02:01:14.567
EARLY ON AS PART OF TESTING THE

02:01:14.634 --> 02:01:15.935
DATA AND ITS ACCURACY.

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:18.704
AND IN ONE WORD THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:01:18.771 --> 02:01:20.840
IS TRANSFORMATIONAL.

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.541
IT IS INCREDIBLY ACCURATE BUT

02:01:22.608 --> 02:01:24.076
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:26.445
ASPECT OF IT IS FIGURING OUT THE

02:01:26.512 --> 02:01:28.214
TIMING OF WHEN THE WATER IS

02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.115
COMING DOWN.

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:31.417
SO WE CAN PROACTIVELY MANAGE FOR

02:01:31.484 --> 02:01:33.285
MULTIPLE PURPOSES SO IT IS WATER

02:01:33.352 --> 02:01:34.987
MANAGEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:36.155
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ITS

02:01:36.222 --> 02:01:38.858
ECOSYSTEM PROTECTION RESTORATION

02:01:38.924 --> 02:01:40.660
WERE USING AT ALL AND THAT'S

02:01:40.726 --> 02:01:42.595
THAT OUR EXPERIENCE WITH IN THE

02:01:42.662 --> 02:01:43.629
MONO BASIN.

02:01:43.696 --> 02:01:45.031
I THINK AS WE LOOK TO THE FUTURE

02:01:45.097 --> 02:01:45.831
ONE WILL UNDERSCORE THE

02:01:45.898 --> 02:01:47.767
IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY MAKING

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:49.135
THE SUMMARY OF THE DATA

02:01:49.201 --> 02:01:51.437
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BUT THE

02:01:51.504 --> 02:01:52.672
DATA ITSELF.

02:01:52.738 --> 02:01:53.939
SO IT SHOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

02:01:54.006 --> 02:01:57.043
THE PROVISIONS OF AB SEVENTEEN

02:01:57.109 --> 02:01:57.643
FIFTY FIVE AS WE LOOK AT THIS

02:01:57.710 --> 02:01:58.377
DATA.

02:01:58.444 --> 02:02:01.013
THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONAL DATA

02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:03.182
FOR ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE

02:02:03.249 --> 02:02:04.750
WE CAN'T MANAGE WHAT WE DON'T

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:06.185
UNDERSTAND.

02:02:06.252 --> 02:02:08.754
AND THIS DATA PROVIDES AS CLOSE

02:02:08.821 --> 02:02:11.424
TO REAL TIME WATER DATA UP AND

02:02:11.490 --> 02:02:13.426
DOWN THE STAIRS TO REALLY FIGURE

02:02:13.492 --> 02:02:15.695
OUT HOW TO MANAGE NOT JUST FOR

02:02:15.761 --> 02:02:18.464
WATER AND RESOURCES BUT ACROSS

02:02:18.531 --> 02:02:19.198
THE BREADTH.

02:02:19.265 --> 02:02:21.534
OF RESOURCE ISSUES THAT ARE

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:23.269
COMMUNITIES ARE FACING -- WITH

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:25.271
CLIMATE CHANGE SO THANK YOU VERY

02:02:25.337 --> 02:02:28.708

02:03:47.453 --> 02:03:49.555
THE OBJECTIVES ARE SOUND IN MY

02:03:49.622 --> 02:03:51.423
QUESTION JUST GOES TO THE IN THE

02:03:51.490 --> 02:03:53.125
ANALYSIS.

02:03:53.192 --> 02:03:54.360
IT SEEKING.

02:03:54.426 --> 02:03:56.996
A COMMITMENT OF FUNDING FOR OVER

02:03:57.062 --> 02:03:58.998
TEN YEARS -- IN IT LOOKS LIKE IT

02:03:59.064 --> 02:04:01.233
PENCILS OUT FIFTEEN MILLION A

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:02.835
YEAR FOR TEN YEARS.

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:03.969
DO YOU KNOW OFFHAND WHAT

02:04:04.036 --> 02:04:06.372
PERCENTAGE OF THAT WOULD BE PART

02:04:06.438 --> 02:04:08.841
OF THE CONTRACT WITH NASA OR

02:04:08.908 --> 02:04:10.776
WHOEVER'S DOING THE THE AERIAL

02:04:10.843 --> 02:04:13.712
SURVEILLANCE.

02:04:13.779 --> 02:04:15.047
WELL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

02:04:15.114 --> 02:04:17.149
THE THAT CURRENTLY WITH WHAT'S

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:19.985
HAPPENING IS ALL OF THAT -- WELL

02:04:20.052 --> 02:04:21.554
I WOULD EXPECT THAT IT WILL.

02:04:21.620 --> 02:04:23.189
ALL OF IT WOULD WOULD COME FROM

02:04:23.255 --> 02:04:24.590
ALL OF IT WOULD BE PART OF THE

02:04:24.657 --> 02:04:25.825
CONTRACT BUT MAYBE.

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:28.127
MAYBE WITH THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

02:04:28.194 --> 02:04:29.795
CURRENT CONTRACT WE CAN.

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.363
THE MAJORITY THE COST WOULD BE

02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:32.598
FOR THE AERIAL SURVEYS THAT

02:04:32.665 --> 02:04:33.666
WHICH COULD BE CONDUCTED BY AT

02:04:33.732 --> 02:04:36.335
NASA OR A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR.

02:04:36.402 --> 02:04:38.404
IN ITS ITS ADMINISTERED THROUGH

02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:40.940
DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES IS

02:04:41.006 --> 02:04:43.275
THAT CORRECT IN SO THERE'S THE

02:04:43.342 --> 02:04:45.711
TRANSPARENCY OF THE DATA --

02:04:45.778 --> 02:04:47.580
GOING UP AND I THINK FOR

02:04:47.646 --> 02:04:49.014
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT OF A

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.250
COMMITMENT OF THE TEN YEAR

02:04:51.317 --> 02:04:53.586
FUNDING -- WHAT'S THE

02:04:53.652 --> 02:04:57.690
TRANSPARENCY ON HOW THE MONEY IS

02:04:57.756 --> 02:05:01.193
ACTUALLY SPENT.

02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:03.596
IN TERMS OF THOSE CONTRACTS WITH

02:05:03.662 --> 02:05:05.231
NASA I ASSUME OR YES I'D LIKE

02:05:05.297 --> 02:05:07.366
RECORD.

02:05:07.433 --> 02:05:08.934
COM I WOULD I WOULD EXPECT WE'D

02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:10.402
HAVE FULL TRANSPARENCY IF THAT'S

02:05:10.469 --> 02:05:11.837
NOT CLEAR IN THE BILL WE CAN

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:12.104
MAKE IT.

02:05:12.171 --> 02:05:13.439
WE CAN MAKE THAT CLEAR IN

02:05:13.505 --> 02:05:15.908
ADDITION TO ANY -- OVERHEAD THAT

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:17.243
MIGHT BE.

02:05:17.309 --> 02:05:18.377
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO LIMIT THE

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:20.646
OVERHEAD TO AND I I ALSO WANT TO

02:05:20.713 --> 02:05:22.147
JUST BE UNDERSTOOD I UNDERSTAND

02:05:22.214 --> 02:05:25.918
THE BENEFIT OFTEN OF LONG TERM.

02:05:25.985 --> 02:05:27.553
COMMITMENT FOR THE PURPOSE OF

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.121
CONTRACTING AND THAT HOPE IF

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:31.090
THIS COMMITMENT IS MADE BY THE

02:05:31.156 --> 02:05:32.191
LEGISLATURE.

02:05:32.258 --> 02:05:34.393
HE COULD ALSO RESULT IN PERHAPS

02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:36.161
SOME MORE NEGOTIATING LEVERAGE

02:05:36.228 --> 02:05:38.030
WITH NASSER WHOEVER THE

02:05:38.097 --> 02:05:41.033
CONTRACTOR IS -- TO BE ABLE TO

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.802
MAKE THAT LONGER TERM COMMITMENT

02:05:43.869 --> 02:05:45.938
IN A SINGLE BUDGET YEAR.

02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:47.606
YOU RAISE A GOOD POINT I MY

02:05:47.673 --> 02:05:48.140
UNDERSTANDING.

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:50.242
FROM.

02:05:50.309 --> 02:05:51.377
FROM PAST WORK THAT I'VE DONE IS

02:05:51.443 --> 02:05:55.581
THAT -- NASA -- DOES SIGNIFICANT

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.850
AERIAL.

02:05:57.917 --> 02:06:01.020
ANALYSIS -- RESEARCH AND

02:06:01.086 --> 02:06:03.255
ANALYSIS NOT ONLY ON SNOW PACK

02:06:03.322 --> 02:06:05.024
BUT ALSO IN VEGETATION --

02:06:05.090 --> 02:06:06.725
PARTICULARLY AS THEY'VE BEEN

02:06:06.792 --> 02:06:08.360
LOOKING AT THE DEAD AND DYING

02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:10.562
TREES -- THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:11.864
MAPPING AND SO I I THINK THERE'S

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:13.299
PROBABLY ECONOMIES OF SCALE

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:14.066
THERE.

02:06:14.133 --> 02:06:15.768
BUT AT LEAST FOR THIS PURPOSE

02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:17.569
WE'VE PUT IT AB APPROXIMATE

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:18.837
AMOUNT BASED ON THE PAST

02:06:18.904 --> 02:06:21.040
CONTRACTS AND I I DO EXPECT THAT

02:06:21.106 --> 02:06:22.574
THERE WOULD BE EFFICIENCIES AT

02:06:22.641 --> 02:06:24.643
SOME POINT BUT THANK YOU AGAIN I

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:26.312
AM SUPPORTIVE TODAY I WOULD ALSO

02:06:26.378 --> 02:06:27.379
THINK.

02:06:27.446 --> 02:06:28.914
IF NECESSARY BOB MAYBE WE

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.115
APPROACH OUR FEDERAL

02:06:30.182 --> 02:06:31.650
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION SEE IF

02:06:31.717 --> 02:06:33.619
THEY WANNA CHIP INTO THIS

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:35.020
IMPORTANT EFFORT AS WELL.

02:06:35.087 --> 02:06:37.556
THANK YOU.

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.124
OKAY SIR MONNING VICE CHAIR WELL

02:06:39.191 --> 02:06:40.559
ON ON THAT NOTE RIGHT INTO

02:06:40.626 --> 02:06:42.795
QUESTIONS ONE FOR THE OTHER ONE

02:06:42.861 --> 02:06:44.863
FOR FRANK -- ON THE FUNDING HAVE

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.799
YOU CONSIDERED LOOKING AT CAP

02:06:46.865 --> 02:06:48.834
AND TRADE DOLLARS RATHER THAN

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.869
GENERAL FUND DOLLARS.

02:06:50.936 --> 02:06:53.572
HI A WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

02:06:53.639 --> 02:06:55.774
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES -- AND

02:06:55.841 --> 02:06:57.776
FRANKLY THAT'S A DISCUSSION WITH

02:06:57.843 --> 02:06:59.311
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS

02:06:59.378 --> 02:07:01.647
OF WHERE THE RESOURCES MIGHT BE

02:07:01.714 --> 02:07:03.449
BEST.

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:03.949
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE

02:07:04.016 --> 02:07:05.417
SOMETHING A LOOKING INTO AS WELL

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.052
THEN ON FRANK YOU MENTION A

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:08.988
COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE THIS

02:07:09.054 --> 02:07:10.489
HAS ALREADY BEEN HELPFUL.

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:12.291
WHAT -- HOW MANY YEARS AND HAVE

02:07:12.358 --> 02:07:14.693
YOU BEEN OR HAS THIS BEEN USED

02:07:14.760 --> 02:07:16.462
IN THE AREAS IT'S ALREADY BEING

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:17.830
USED?

02:07:17.896 --> 02:07:19.531
A GOOD QUESTION IT'S BEEN IT'S

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:20.666
BEEN A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

02:07:20.733 --> 02:07:23.068
EFFORT FOR AT LEAST SEVEN YEARS

02:07:23.135 --> 02:07:25.137
IT WAS STARTED IN TWENTY

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:26.338
THIRTEEN WITH OUR FIRST WINTER

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:27.473
SURVEYS.

02:07:27.539 --> 02:07:29.108
AND SO THE TWO WITH ONLY THIS

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:31.443
PHONE ME AND BEGINNING -- THIS

02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:32.678
WILL BE THE THIRD YEAR FOR THE

02:07:32.745 --> 02:07:34.747
SAN JOAQUIN SYSTEM AND SO IT'S

02:07:34.813 --> 02:07:36.081
THIS YEAR THAT WE'RE JUST

02:07:36.148 --> 02:07:37.416
STARTING TO GET THE MODELS.

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:38.684
UP AND RUNNING FROM THE THE

02:07:38.751 --> 02:07:39.885
SERVICE AND THE EXPERIENCE SO

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.720
FAR HAS BEEN THAT THE MODELS

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:43.956
THAT THE THAT THE ANALYSIS

02:07:44.023 --> 02:07:46.291
PREDICTS ACTUALLY.

02:07:46.358 --> 02:07:47.526
AT AND THEY'RE PLAYING OUT.

02:07:47.593 --> 02:07:49.294
VERY CLOSER EXACTLY HOW THE

02:07:49.361 --> 02:07:51.063
MODEL SAYS ARE GONNA.

02:07:51.130 --> 02:07:53.132
GO AT THE THE THE QUANTITY OF

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:55.134
SNOW THAT IS IS CAPTURED ON THE

02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:58.070
GROUND IS THE 96298% SO THE

02:07:58.137 --> 02:07:59.505
TOTAL RUNOFF FOR THE YEAR IN

02:07:59.571 --> 02:08:02.141
APRIL CAN BE.

02:08:02.207 --> 02:08:04.009
ESTIMATED ON APRIL FIRST.

02:08:04.076 --> 02:08:05.044
AS LONG AS YOU'RE NEGLECTING

02:08:05.110 --> 02:08:06.645
FUTURE RAINFALL MUTE YOU'LL

02:08:06.712 --> 02:08:07.546
NEVER GET THAT CRITICAL.

02:08:07.613 --> 02:08:09.381
WHAT INSPIRED MY QUESTIONS YOU

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:11.283
SAID THAT THE THE -- AN ACT AND

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:12.418
I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL AND I

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.386
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET US SOME

02:08:14.453 --> 02:08:15.988
MORE BACKGROUND ON IT I GUESS.

02:08:16.055 --> 02:08:18.490
THE THE KERN RIVER I'VE MANAGER

02:08:18.557 --> 02:08:19.658
YOU SAID IS.

02:08:19.725 --> 02:08:23.128
HOLDING BACK A RELEASE BASED ON

02:08:23.195 --> 02:08:25.397
THE ANALYSIS THAT HE'S RECEIVING

02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:26.899
RIGHT NOW SO.

02:08:26.965 --> 02:08:28.233
NOT THAT EXAMPLE BUT ARE THERE

02:08:28.300 --> 02:08:30.402
OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE THEY WERE

02:08:30.469 --> 02:08:31.837
SOMEBODY MADE A DECISION.

02:08:31.904 --> 02:08:33.939
AND THE MODELING WAS INACCURATE

02:08:34.006 --> 02:08:34.506
I GUESS IS KIND OF WHERE I'M

02:08:34.573 --> 02:08:35.674
GOING WITH THIS.

02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:37.009
YEAH I I MEAN I THINK THE

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:39.611
EXAMPLE -- THAT THAT WE SAW ON

02:08:39.678 --> 02:08:42.181
THE THE TALL ME IS THE MOST

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:44.049
INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THEY THEY'RE

02:08:44.116 --> 02:08:45.651
BEING TOLD BY FLOOD CONTROL

02:08:45.717 --> 02:08:47.419
CURBS SO FLOOD CONTROL CURVE IS

02:08:47.486 --> 02:08:48.454
SORT OF AN ENGINEERS

02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:50.155
APPROXIMATION OF YOUR RISK OF

02:08:50.222 --> 02:08:51.623
FUTURE RAINFALL.

02:08:51.690 --> 02:08:53.125
AND THE RISK OF FUTURE SNOW

02:08:53.192 --> 02:08:55.661
MALCOLM OCCURRING SIMULTANEOUSLY

02:08:55.727 --> 02:08:56.195
AND THEN OVERTOPPING YOUR

02:08:56.261 --> 02:08:57.062
RESERVOIR.

02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:58.263
SO THEY'VE GOT A STATISTICAL

02:08:58.330 --> 02:09:00.599
MODEL BUT IF YOU CAN ACTUALLY.

02:09:00.666 --> 02:09:02.501
COUNT ALL THE WATER MOLECULES ON

02:09:02.568 --> 02:09:03.502
THE GROUND.

02:09:03.569 --> 02:09:05.404
ON EVERY SQUARE METER OF EARTH

02:09:05.471 --> 02:09:07.172
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S NO

02:09:07.239 --> 02:09:08.273
ATMOSPHERIC RIVER COMING.

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:09.575
THEN YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR RISK IS

02:09:09.641 --> 02:09:10.809
THERE'S NO MORE STATISTICAL

02:09:10.876 --> 02:09:12.044
GUESSWORK.

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:13.812
AND SO IS THE STATISTICAL

02:09:13.879 --> 02:09:15.013
ADVANCE FOR QUESTIONS AT THAT

02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:16.248
YEAH NO I THINK YOU DID AND

02:09:16.315 --> 02:09:17.416
THAT'S THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING

02:09:17.483 --> 02:09:18.684
THAT THAT IS ONE THE REASONS WHY

02:09:18.750 --> 02:09:21.587
I'M SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE IT'S

02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:23.188
THE ACCURACY SEEMS TO BE.

02:09:23.255 --> 02:09:28.293
RIGHT ON SPOT SO -- THANK YOU

02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:29.862
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD IN.

02:09:29.928 --> 02:09:30.963
I MEAN TO OUR EARLIER

02:09:31.029 --> 02:09:33.332
CONVERSATION TRYING.

02:09:33.398 --> 02:09:35.601
TO I GUESS GET THE DATA PART OF

02:09:35.667 --> 02:09:37.636
THIS PUZZLE SORTED OUT IN A MORE

02:09:37.703 --> 02:09:38.604
ACCURATE WAYS WE CAN ACTUALLY

02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:39.872
SCOPE [inaudible]

02:09:39.938 --> 02:09:41.707
THE NEED.

02:09:41.773 --> 02:09:43.876
DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT

02:09:43.942 --> 02:09:44.176
[inaudible]

02:09:44.243 --> 02:09:47.913
SAVINGS THIS KIND OF THE ACT TO

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.715
INCREASE ACCURACY COULD YIELD DO

02:09:49.781 --> 02:09:51.683
YOU HAVE ANY I MEAN YOU MENTION

02:09:51.750 --> 02:09:53.852
A 10%.

02:09:53.919 --> 02:09:55.854
SORT OF FALL SHORTFALL IN OTHER

02:09:55.921 --> 02:09:57.389

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:58.490
BUILT IN BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER

02:09:58.557 --> 02:10:00.058
WAYS TO PUT TOGETHER ESTIMATES

02:10:00.125 --> 02:10:00.559
HERE [inaudible]

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:04.696
SORT OF COST OVER TIME -- I OVER

02:10:04.763 --> 02:10:07.266
TIME.

02:10:07.332 --> 02:10:08.967
I MEAN THERE'S AVOIDED COSTS FOR

02:10:09.034 --> 02:10:10.903
FLOOD RISK WHICH I I MEAN ARE

02:10:10.969 --> 02:10:12.538
VERY DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE I

02:10:12.604 --> 02:10:13.105
MEAN THE WHOLE SNOW SURVEY

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.072
PROGRAM.

02:10:14.139 --> 02:10:15.941
WAS BUILT ON RESOLVING FLOOD

02:10:16.008 --> 02:10:18.911
RISK RIGHT SO -- BUT THE

02:10:18.977 --> 02:10:19.878
ADDITIONAL COSTS OF

02:10:19.945 --> 02:10:21.113
OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU WOULD FOR

02:10:21.180 --> 02:10:22.614
GONE IS THE WAY THAT I WOULD

02:10:22.681 --> 02:10:24.316

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:27.319
FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET.

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:28.887
ON ON THE TWELVE MAY I MEAN

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:30.289
WHAT'S WHAT'S THAT WORTH WHAT'S

02:10:30.355 --> 02:10:32.257
THAT WORTH IN A DRY YEAR --

02:10:32.324 --> 02:10:33.592
