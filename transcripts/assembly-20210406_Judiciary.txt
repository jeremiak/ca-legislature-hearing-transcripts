WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE CAN START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE SO ALL THOSE AUTHORS WITH BILLS IF THEY COULD COME SO WE COULD START OUR PROCEEDINGS. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME EVERYONE HERE BUT NOTICE A COUPLE OF PRACTICAL ISSUES AS WE GET STARTED SINCE WE'RE STILL CURRENTLY. UNDER CONTINUED STAY AT HOME ORDERS WERE PRACTICING PHYSICAL DISTANCING HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING SO WE HAVE ONLY. A LIMITED NUMBER OF SPACES FOR PEOPLE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM WE REQUIRE THAT MASS BE WARNED AND THAT PHYSICAL DISTANCING BE MAINTAINED AT ALL TIMES. BECAUSE OF THESE. SPACE LIMITATIONS WILL HAVE MEMBER SORT OF SPREAD OUT OF THE DICE I THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH ROOM FOR EVERYONE WITH THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING BUT IF NOT THERE MIGHT BE MEMBERS SEATED IN THE FIRST ROW OF SEATS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DISTANCES. FOR WITNESSES TODAY WE DO HAVE A WITNESS VIDEO ROOM THAT CAN BE UTILIZED. WITNESSES CAN ALSO BE HERE IN THE HEARING ROOM BUT NOTICE THE- WE'VE BUT WE WILL MAINTAIN THE DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS MOST WITNESSES TODAY WILL BE CALLING IN. IF YOU'RE IN THE HEARING ROOM WE ARE GOING TO MAINTAIN DISTANCING AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THAT I MENTIONED LET ME KNOW AND I'LL ASK YOU TO COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. THAT THERE IS A SPECIFIC MICROPHONE HERE THAT WITNESSES CAN USE BUT WE ASK THAT NOBODY TOUCH THAT MICROPHONE TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY AND THE SAFETY FOR ALL FOR ANYONE WHO WISHES TO COMMENT. VIA TELEPHONE. THERE IS A PUBLIC TOLL FREE NUMBER THAT NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. IT'S ALSO UP ON OUR WEBSITE. FOR THE COMMITTEE AGAIN THAT IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO- TO HAVE THAT ACCESS CODE IS ALSO UP ON THE WEBSITE AGAIN THE ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR TWO OH TWO. SO THAT YOU CAN CALL IN AND WHEN YOU DO THE OPERATOR WILL GIVE YOU YOUR OPTIONS AND- WILL HELP YOU. I UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU NEED TO INDICATE THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK. SO WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR WE'LL START WITH OUR ITEM NUMBER TWO THEN AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN MR GABRIEL. SO OPERATOR YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES NOW FOR. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IF ANYONE WANTS TO BE ON THE LINE. WE'LL START WITH THE- PRESENTATION BY THE AUTHOR AND THEN MOVE TO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION SECURE BILL WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER KAREN MEMBER I WANT TO START TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MOMENTS I WANT TO THANK YOU. AND YOUR STAFF FOR THE HARD WORK AND THOUGHTFUL ASSISTANCE ON THOSE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU AND IF SOMEONE ELSE COMMITTEE NOW EXPANDING ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY MIND SINCE I JOINED THE LEGISLATURE. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO THINK OF CIRCUMSTANCES MORE COMPELLING FOR EXTENDING THAT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THEN IN THE EVICTION CONTEXT AND PARTICULARLY IN THE MIDDLE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. TODAY I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATION FUND KNOWN AS THE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION FUND. TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RENTERS AND HELP PREVENT HOMELESSNESS BEFORE IT BEGINS. THIS BILL IS BASED ON THREE KEY NOTIONS. THE FIRST IS THAT EVICTION DEFENSE IS KEY TO MEANINGFULLY ADDRESSING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME. AND MONEY FOCUSED ON HOW WE HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT NOT ENOUGH ON HOW WE CAN PREVENT HOMELESSNESS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. AND THE DATA MAKES CLEAR THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO FOCUS ON IN L. A. COUNTY ON AVERAGE EVERY SINGLE DAY TWO HUNDRED SEVEN PEOPLE ARE HOUSED. IN TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN PEOPLE BECOME NEWLY HOMELESS TWO THIRDS FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO THE PROBLEM GETS WORSE EVERY DAY AND THE DATA MAKES CLEAR THAT EVICTIONS PLAY A KEY ROLE IN DRIVING HOMELESSNESS SO WE SURE WANT TO SERIOUSLY ADDRESS OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. WE NEED TO ADDRESS AFFECTIONS. THE SECOND NOTION IS THAT LEGAL SERVICES ARE AN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. AS THE ANALYSIS NOTES THE IMPORTANT TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE PASSED RECENTLY. ARE NOT SELF EXECUTING. THEY REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE LEGAL PROCESS AND OF LEGAL RIGHTS. AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. AND WE KNOW THAT RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAMS ARE PROVEN TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS WE'VE SEEN THIS FROM INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS. WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE PROVEN TO SAVE TAXPAYER RESOURCES. IN NEW YORK THEY'RE EXPECTED TO SAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAM. AND IN LA AN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS FROM FOR EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED. THE STATE BE THEIR PUBLIC BENEFITTED IN FORT FOUR DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS IN AVOIDED COSTS AND SO WE HAVE CAREFULLY CRAFTED THIS PROGRAM. TO LEVERAGE EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND AREAS OF EXPERTISE. AND THE THIRD IS THAT MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. ENGRAVED ON THE FRONT OF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT OR THE WORDS EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW. BUT YOU'RE IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN A LEGAL DISPUTE WITH POTENTIALLY LIFE CHANGING CONSEQUENCES WHERE ONE PARTY IS REPRESENTED AND THE OTHER IS NOT. THE NOTION OF EQUAL JUSTICE CAN SEEM ILLUSORY. AND IN THIS CONTEXT WE KNOW THAT 90% OF LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED COMPARED TO ONLY 10% OF TENANTS. AND SO THIS BILL WILL HELP TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. I WANT TO KNOW THE REPRESENTATION DOESN'T CHANGE THE SUBSTANTIVE LAW. IT DOESN'T CHANGE LEGAL RIGHTS AND DUTIES IT DOESN'T PUT A THUMB ON THE SCALE. IT MERELY MEANS THAT EVICTION PROCEEDINGS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE DECIDED BASED ON THE FACTS AND THE LAW. RATHER THE INABILITY TO AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. AND SO THIS BILL WILL HELP SECURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN A MANNER THAT SAVES LIVES IT SAVES TAXPAYER RESOURCES. AND HELP OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM LIVE UP TO ITS HIGHEST IDEALS. THAT'S PART OF THE REASON IT'S SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF MORE THAN FIFTY NONPROFIT COMMUNITY AND FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY ARE GREASY ELEPHANTS ON FROM LOS ANGELES AND SASHA HARDEN FROM INNER CITY LAWCENTER. THANK YOU AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER BILL BEFORE WE- GO ON TO THE WITNESSES WE DO HAVE A QUORUM I'D LIKE TO STATUS QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE. HERE GALLAGHER HERE'S- CHAU. CHIU DAVIES HERE GONZALEZ.

SAID SARTIN OKAY DAN GROSS YELLOW PENZONE. SO YES. WHAT. OKAY I'M GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS FOR SALE. I AM A TENANT IN LOS ANGELES AND HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SEVEN. WHAT FIRST HAPPENED MY HUSBAND AND I HAD RECENTLY SEPARATED. MEETING MY SIX YEAR OLD SON AND MYSELF WITH ONLY MY INCOME AS A HAIR STYLIST. AND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS TO MY NAME. BEING THAT I WASN'T WILLING TO BREAK THE LAW BY CONTINUING TO WORK. AND THE NEED TO KEEP MY SON AND MYSELF THEY FROM COVERAGE I WAS UNABLE TO PAY MY RENT. I STARTED SUBMITTING MY DECLARATION TO MY LANDLORD. TENANT SEPTEMBER WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS PREGNANT THE ADDED STRESS. AND UNCERTAINTY. I HEARD MY DEPRESSION CAUSING ME TO GET THE MEETING MIGHT. THAT IS ON MY MARK FILE AN EVICTION CASE AGAINST ME IN COURT. I THOUGHT THAT MY SON AND MYSELF COULD END UP HOMELESS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PANDEMIC. WHILE PREGNANT WAS TRULY TERRIFYING WHEN I WENT TO COURT TO FILE MY RESPONSE AND RECEIVE THE PAPERWORK THAT I HAD TO FILL OUT I SOON REALIZED I WAS IN WAY OVER MY HEAD I THOUGHT ALONE. AND SCARED. THANKFULLY I FOUND LEGAL AID AND MY ATTORNEY FILED A MOTION IN COURT IN WHICH THE JUDGE RULED. THAT I HAD AN EXCUSABLE REASON TEXT GIPSON READING MY DECLARATION AND ALLOWED ME TO STAY IN MY HOME. THIS CAME AS AN IMMENSE RELIEF TO ME. KNOWINGTHAT I WOULD STILL HAVE A SAFE PLACE FOR MY SON AND MYSELF. BUT THAT I WOULD ALSO HAVE A PLACE TO BRING MY BABY HOME IN JUNE. THAT IS WHY I AM HERE TODAY. TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THAT PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF. HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE KEEPING THEIR HOME. I DON'T KNOW WHERE WHERE WHERE I WOULD BE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR LEGAL AID. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THIS PLACE. GOOD MORNING TERM MEMBERS SASHA HARDEN WITH THE INNER CITY LAWCENTER TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE THOUGHT. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY THAT WILL HAVE BENEFITS NOT ONLY FOR LOW INCOME RENTERS FACING EVICTION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THE COURTS AND THE STATE AS A WHOLE THE BILL ADVANCES A PROVEN MODEL THAT IS EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY SUCCESSFUL AND EFFECTUATE INFECTION PROTECTION THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY PASSED BUT THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. FOR TENANTS LIKE METHODS- LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND REPRESENTATION CO DETECTION PROTECTIONS ARE MOSTLY WORKING BUT FOR THOSE WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY WE'VE SEEN TENANTS WHO THOSE PROTECTIONS APPLY TO EXPERIENCE A RANGE. OF CHALLENGES TRYING TO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS IN COURT. RESEARCHERS PROGRAMS THIS. IMPROVE CASE OUTCOMES TENANTS WHO GO ON REPRESENTED AT A FAR GREATER RATE. RESULT IN A RANGE OF COST SAVINGS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND EFFICIENCIES FOR THE COURTS. I CAN IMPROVE RACIAL EQUITY IN THE EVICTION PROCESS AND HELP STABILIZE FAMILIES RESULTING IN A RANGE OF OTHER BENEFITS LIKE DECREASED SCHOOL OPTIONS. REMEMBER GABRIEL MENTIONED THE RETURN N INVESTMENT FOR A COMMUNITIES IN CONNECTION OF RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAMS. NOW THE TIME TO MAKE THAT INVESTMENT FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S RENTERS I'M RESPECTFULLY- DR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

AND AT THIS TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU WE'LL THEN MOVE ON TO OPPOSITION I HAVE TO LISTED DEBRA CARLTON OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION. AND CREAM THREE C. OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS BOTH ON THE TELEPHONE. MISS CARLSON. YES GOOD MORNING. MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE DEBRA CARLTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION I CA DOESN'T OPPOSE EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TODAY BECAUSE WE OBJECT TO THE IDEA. THAT LOW INCOME TENANTS SHOULD HAVE A LEGITIMATE REPRESENTATION JUST AS YOUR WITNESS I DESCRIBED. BUT WE OPPOSED BECAUSE OF WHAT WE SEE IS BOILERPLATE DELAYS. BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE YEARS AND ETHICAL LEGAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT USE THAT THE DELAY OBJECTIONS HURTING PROPERTY OWNERS AND GOOD NEIGHBOR TENANTS WHO WANT TO LIVE IN A PEACEFUL HOME. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS AND SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALREADY COMMITTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THESE PRACTICES. UNFORTUNATELY IT'S BECOME A COMMON PRACTICE FOR UNETHICAL TENDED TO TURN IS TO USE BORDER PLATE PRE DRAFTED PLEADINGS TO DELAY OF ACTIONS. SOME EVEN FORGET TO CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE TENANTS WITHIN THE BODY OF THE PLEADINGS. MOST OF THESE PLANS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THE REALITY IS THAT THESE MOTIONS ARE USED TO CAUSE A DELAY NOT BECAUSE THERE IS AN ACTUAL MERIT TO THE MOTION. AT THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION HAVE ACKNOWLEDGED THESE DELAYS UNDERMINED THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF AN EXPEDITED RESOLUTION OF AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER ACTIONS CAN LEAD TO MULTIPLE COURT APPEARANCES IN HEARINGS INCREASING COSTS AND CONFUSIONS. HERE'S WHAT YOU FIND WHEN YOU SEEK HELP ONLINE- ONE WEBSITE ANNOUNCES STOPPER DELAY OBJECTIONS NOW GET THREE TO SIX MONTHS GUARANTEED IN YOUR HOUSE THREE WITHOUT PAYING RENT. ANOTHER ATTORNEY BRAGS AND ANNOUNCES ON HIS WEBSITE. HIS RECORD FOR KEEPING TENANTS IN PLACE IS FOUR AND A HALF YEARS WITH FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PAID TO THE TENANTS. YOU KNOW EVICTION IS A HORRIBLE LAST RESORT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE AN INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS BUT THE ANSWER SHOULD BE TO GIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ALLOW THESE TYPES OF BOILER PLATE- PLEADINGS. IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO FINALLY TO NOTE THAT MANY RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE NOT BEEN PAID RENT IN OVER A YEAR DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. IN THE END UNFORTUNATELY THE WINTERS THAT WE ARTS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC'S BUTTON OF THESE OWNERS AND TENANTS WILL LOSE THAT PROPERTY TO FORECLOSURE. DELAY DOESN'T PERMANENTLY HELP TENANTS IN THE LONG RUN TODAY WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU AND THEN MR DRESSY. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR NUMBERS- CREAM GREASY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HERE K. WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN ESTABLISHES THE HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION FUND TO PROVIDE IT SEEMS FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO TENANTS IN NEED. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL STATE THAT PRE LEGAL SERVICES SHALL NOT BE PROVIDED TO HOUSEHOLDS WHOSE INCOME EXCEEDS 80% AND MINE. HOWEVER THE BILL THEN GOES ON TO PROVIDE THE PALM LOOPHOLE. STATING THAT IF FUNDING IS PROVIDED TO THE FIND THAT KERRY CAN INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN 80% AND BY THE MORE INCLUSIVE REQUIREMENTS SHALL APPLY. MEANING FUNDING COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FREE LEGAL SERVICES TO TENANTS WHOSE INCOME WELL EXCEEDS 80% DAMAI. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH THIS CALL ISN'T NECESSARY AT THE BILL ALREADY PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR THESE FREE SERVICES TO BE ABUSED BY TENANTS WITH MUCH HIGHER INCOME LEVELS. BY PROVIDING THAT A SELF ATTESTATION. WITHOUT PENALTY PENALTY OF PERJURY YOU SUFFICIENT TO OBTAIN THE SERVICES. C. A. R. STANDS READY TO BE HELP ONE BILL COULD SUPPORT THOSE IN NEED. HOWEVER IS CURRENTLY CRAFTING EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PAINFUL COLD THAT WILL MOST CERTAINLY BE ABUSED THEREBY DENYING ACTUAL PENDANT NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO OBTAIN HELP. BECAUSE OF THESE AND OTHER CONCERNS C. A. R. RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING VOTE ON. EIGHTY FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW IS THE TIME FOR OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OPERATOR YOU CAN OPEN THE LINES FOR THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED TO AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. IF THEY COULD JUST GIVE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND THAT THEY OPPOSE WE WILL BE TAKING ANY FURTHER TESTIMONY. A PRETTY GOOD OPEN LINES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. THIS PRESS ONE THEN ZERO.

MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MATT BRADY WITH MGM ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES IN OPPOSITION. GET MEDICARE AT THIS TIME WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES WE RING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TRANSGRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MR GABRIEL- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD IT'S CLEAR THAT COVERED NINETEEN AND THIS PANDEMIC- HAS EXACERBATED THE EXISTING. ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AT THE LEFT LOTS OF PEOPLE WITHOUT JOBS AND BUT THE BILL STILL HAVE TO BE PAID. I KNOW THAT WE'VE ALREADY PASSED AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT AND SB NINETY ONE TO PREVENT TENANTS FROM BEING EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES AND WHEN THE QUESTION COMES FROM OPPOSITION AS WITH ALL THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE DO WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER BILL. AND I APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS PREPARED AND I WOULD QUOTE. THE ANSWER IS UNEQUIVOCALLY YES. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACE HIGHER RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC IN OUR INCREASED RISK OF EVICTION. AB FOURTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS GOING TO CREATE AS YOU STATED A STATE WIDE EVICTION DEFENSE PROGRAM THAT WILL TARGET FUNDS TOWARDS LOCAL LET REVEREND LEGAL REPRESENTATION. FOR AT RISK COMMUNITIES I APPRECIATED THAT ASIDE FOR THE COMMUNITIES- THAT HAVE BEEN HIT THE HARDEST LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND CENTRAL VALLEY. I DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMENTS THAT THE COMMENTATORS- THAT- LOOTED THEIR THEIR THERE'S- FOR THIS INCLUDING VERY SPECIFICALLY THE INLAND EQUITY PARTNERSHIP. WHICH IS WORK VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO AVOID THESE EVICTIONS AND AVOID FUTURE HOMELESSNESS- AND THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION I APPRECIATE AND- WHAT. I DO GATHER FROM THERE THE COMMENTS IS THAT THEY DO AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE FREE LEGAL SERVICES. AS I SAY FOR ACTUAL TENANTS IN NEED- AND MY QUESTION TO YOU IS WILL YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOOPHOLES THAT THEY HAVE DESCRIBED. WILL BE CLOSED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO HELP THOSE TENANTS THAT MOST NEED THE HELP. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I MEAN WE'RE ALWAYS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND CERTAINLY ONE- YOU KNOW WANT TO HAVE ANY LOOPHOLES IN THE BILL I THINK THERE'S A TRADE OFF HERE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO BALANCE BETWEEN EFFECTIVELY TARGETING THOSE AND THAT'S VERY CLEARLY STATED IN THE INTENT AND SPELLED OUT. VERSES CREATING A NET ON UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES THAT WOULD PREVENT PARTNERSHIPS A LOT OF THIS BILL IS ABOUT LEVERAGE ABOUT. ORGANIZATIONS BEING ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER I THINK ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE IT UP TO A LOT OF THESE. REALLY WELL RESPECTED BLUE CHIP LEGAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PUBLIC COUNTS ON THE LEGAL A FOUNDATIONAL LOS ANGELES. TO MAKE THE DECISION TO HOW TO TARGET THOSE RESOURCES THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN DIRECTION TO TARGET THEM TO THEM THOSE WHO ARE MOST WANTED ALMOST A RISK. THOSE WHO ARE ALLOCATING THOSE GRANTS ARE SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED TO TED TALLY KATE THEM A TARGET THEM IN THAT FASHION SO CERTAINLY OPEN TO HEARING PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. BUT AGAIN HERE THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT WANTING TO CREATE UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRATIC OBSTACLES THAT WOULD PREVENT REALLY POWERFUL PARTNERSHIPS. THAT WOULD LEVERAGE OUR DOLLARS AND MAKE THEM GO FURTHER. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN FOR ALL THREE THIS BILL. THANK YOU MISTER JUNE. THANK YOU- LET ME JUST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR MOVING FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR SOME OF THE WITNESSES- OR SOME OF THE- THE SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES. QUESTION FIRST TO MISTER HARD DOWN- TO SASHA I KNOW CALIFORNIA WE'VE FUNDED EVICTION OFFENSE IN THE PAST. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM. HAS LEARNED LESSONS FROM THE PAST IS BUILDING ON THOSE INVESTMENTS WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT- EXACTLY THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS WILL BE A BETTER APPROACH THAN PAST APPROACHES. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- IT'S TRUE THAT WE HAVE FUNDED LEGAL RESOURCES FOR TENANTS FACING EVICTION IN THE PAST- AND PASS PROGRAMS WHILE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- HAVE STARTED. REALLY AT THE POINT AT WHICH THAT KIND OF GETS COURT PAPERS AND SO AT THAT POINT. YOU KNOW PAPERS HAVE BEEN FILED CASES ARE HARDER TO RESOLVE PARTIES HAVE SPENT MONEY ON FILING FEES AND THE LIKE- AND THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL IS IT REALLY ENCOURAGES AND SORT OF LEVERAGES. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SET THESE PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN LEGAL A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT WE CAN DO THE OPERATION EDUCATION- AND REACH TENANTS FURTHER UPSTREAM IN THE PROCESS- BEFORE EVICTION CASES OR EVEN FILE- BUT THE SENSE OF THE MODEL THAT WE HAVE. IN PLACE IN LA WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO EXPAND. AND BUILD ON- WHICH IS THE NINE TO ALLOW TO WILL WITH. NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND THE COUNTY TO DO THE AVERAGE IN A WAY THAT'S BOTH SORT OF CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AND TAILORED TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY- IT CREATES A CONTINUUM OF RESOURCES BUT LET'S ATTORNEYS SORT OF RESOLVED. CASES THAT DO GO TO COURT MORE EFFECTIVELY- AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDING. SCRIPTED PREVENTABLE CASES. THANK YOU- AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE OPPOSITION AND THIS IS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSED WITH THAT WITH BOTH CA AND CA ARE OVER THE YEARS. I KNOW THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THE RIGHTS OR DEFENSES AVAILABLE TO TENANTS IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE RIGHTS OF LANDLORDS TO EVICT TENANTS UNDER. A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES OR WHAT THEY MIGHT DO- BEFORE BEING ABLE TO EVICT A TENANT AND YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I THINK FOR MANY OF OUR PERSPECTIVES. WE THINK THAT- ENSURING THAT- TENANTS ARE ABLE TO EXERCISE THE RIGHTS THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE- MAKES A TON OF SENSE. WE ALSO KNOW THE STATISTIC THAT NGUYEN ATTENDANT IS REPRESENTED THERE ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO RECEIVE A BETTER RESULT. AND THIS IS THE STATISTIC THAT REALLY. I THINK IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE. IT'S ESTIMATED NATIONALLY THAT 90% OF ALL LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED. WHERE IS THE FLIP SIDE 90% OF TENANTS ARE UNREPRESENTED AND SO MY QUESTION TO THE OPPOSITION IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE THAT- THAT- THAT THAT THAT THE SITUATION THE STATUS QUO IS OKAY- AND IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT. DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW WE WOULD ENSURE THAT TENANTS ARE A REPRESENTED BECAUSE IT IT IT DOES SEEM THAT THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE INDUSTRY IS THAT THE STATUS QUO SHOULD REMAIN- AND TENANTS SHOULD REMAIN ON REPRESENTED DURING THIS PROCESS I WANT TO JUST UNDERSTAND IF YOU A DIFFERENT WAY OF HOW WE GO ABOUT- ENSURING REPRESENTATION AND REALLY- IT. EQUAL FOOTING IN THE COURTS. THANK YOU MISTER TO ADD DIFFICULTY WITH A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION AS I STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF. MY STATEMENT WE DON'T OBJECT TO THE IDEA THAT LOW INCOME TENANTS HAVE REPRESENTATION- ESPECIALLY FOR A LEGITIMATE DEFENSE WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT. IS HOW TO WE AVOID SOME OF THESE- MOTIONS THAT ARE ACTUALLY JUST A DELAY AND I GET IT THAT'S A HARD THING TO DO- YOU KNOW WE HAVE MEDIATION PROGRAMS IN SOME AREAS. AND IF IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT DELAY- KEEPING TENANTS IN PLACE WOULDN'T A BETTER RESULT BE TO TRY TO FIND A WAY TO. KEEP TENANTS HOUSE PERMANENTLY- WITH RED DOLLARS LIKE WHAT WE HAVE DONE WITH- SB NINETY ONE- INSTEAD OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS JUST. TO TIE UP THE COURT SYSTEMS WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEED TO USE THE COURT SYSTEM. BUT A BETTER RESULT COULD VERY WELL BE EITHER MEDIATION AND OR FINDING. A DOLLARS- FOR TENANTS. TO PAY THE RENT LIKE WE DID WITH SB NINETY ONE. I THINK THIS IS GONNA CERTAINLY BE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT YOU KNOW FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- OUR SOCIETY WE HAVE AGREED THAT IF YOU SHOPLIFT A TOOTHBRUSH FROM REPRESENTATION BUT IF YOU HAVE. LIVED IN YOUR HOME FOR DECADES- AND BECAUSE THIS PANDEMIC YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB- YOU CAN GET KICKED TO THE CURB AND- AND FORCED INTO HOMELESSNESS AND- AND SO IT JUST. STRIKES ME THAT THAT FIGURE OUT THIS BALANCE OF HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT FOLKS REPRESENTED MAKES SENSE I CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THE PERSPECTIVE OF. UNETHICAL TENDED ATTORNEYS I THINK- WE COULD PROBABLY TRY OUT JUST AS MANY EXAMPLES OF UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF CERTAIN LANDLORD ATTORNEYS- BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT- THAT JUST AS LANDLORDS ARE REPRESENTED TENANTS ARE REPRESENTED AS WELL. ALSO JUST NOTED SAN FRANCISCO I AUTHORED. OUR CITY'S FIRST RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAM IN THIS LANDLORD TENANT CONTEXT AND IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE BOTH COST EFFECTIVE AND- AND REALLY ENSURED THAT FOLKS WHO HAVE- HAVE RIGHTS. THAT SHOULD BE VINDICATED- ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THEIR HOMES- AND WE'VE SEEN IT WORK IN OUR CITY- BUT WE KNOW THAT- THERE ARE LITERALLY- IT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TENANTS. EVERY DAY WHO DO NOT HAVE SIMILAR ABILITY TO PROTECT THEMSELVES SO WITH. OPEN AND HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH THE AUTHOR AND- AND- IN THE OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S A WAY. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IF YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE SIMEON FACE VALUE GOOD FAITH THAT PEOPLE DO AGREE THAT THAT THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED TO BE REPRESENTED AB WHAT THAT- I DO HOPE THIS MEASURE PASSES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND- WE NEED TO HAVE THIS ROBUST CONVERSATION. DURING THIS HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. THANK YOU I DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND. THANK YOU AND MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU- SHARE AND THANK YOU DECEMBER GABER FOR BRING THIS FORWARD I WANNA SECOND THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO TO SOMEONE THAT'S REPRESENTED TENANTS IN LANDLORD TENANT COURT- I COMPLETELY AGREE- THAT- THE NATURE OF WHAT A TENANT FACES. THIS IS NOT AN ORDINARY CONTRACT THIS IS THEIR HOME. AND I THINK THAT THEY THINK THAT THERE ARE SO MANY MANY THOUSANDS THAT THAT ARE GOING EVERY WEEKEND TO. COURT MINUTE IN THIS IMBALANCE OF POWER REPRESENTATION- IS UNJUST AND I THINK THERE IS A BALANCE THAT WE CAN FIND TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE'RE NOT UP IN ANY WAY. FEEDING INTO SOME UNSCRUPULOUS ASPECT. OF REPRESENTATION BUT TRUST ME AS SOMEONE THAT'S DONE THAT WORK AND KNOWS PLENTY OF OTHERS THAT DO THAT WORK BUT MANY OF WHICH WORK FOR. LAW SCHOOL CLINICS OR NON PROFITS ARE DOING THE WORK- MOST OF THOSE IN THE INDUSTRY THAT REPRESENTING TENANTS ARE ARE DOING IT- IT LITERALLY TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES SO I APPRECIATE IT- AND- LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. FOR THE AUSTEN'S COMIC. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I. IN IN THE ESPECIALLY OPPOSITION TESTIMONY IT IT'S INTERESTING HOW UNETHICAL ATTORNEYS KIND OF ROLLS OFF THE TONGUE BUT IN A COMMITTEE LIKE THIS WHICH IS MOSTLY ATTORNEYS WE ALL KNOW THAT THERE ARE MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS. ETHICAL BEHAVIOR AND I'M ALSO STRUCK BY THE COMPLAINT THAT A LOT OF THE PLEADINGS ARE DONE FOR ME LATELY AND DONE INFORMS. THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM THAT IT'S AN EFFICIENCY MEASURE WHICH IS WHY LEASES. MOST DOCUMENTS IN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ARE ALSO DONE ON PRE PRINTED FORMS BECAUSE THEY'RE IT'S AN EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THAT THAT'S HARDLY A COMPLAINT HERE. AND SOME OF WHAT WAS. MENTIONED ARE POTENTIALLY GROUNDS FOR MALPRACTICE SO THERE ARE MECHANISMS IN PLACE TO ADDRESS IT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE REASON AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS LONG STOOD UP. FOR THE NEED FOR FUNDING LEGAL SERVICES AT IT HAS BEEN WOEFULLY INADEQUATE OVER THE YEARS AND WITH THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION SERIOUSLY CUTTING BACK. FUNDING FOR LEGAL SERVICES THIS WILL REMAIN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR THIS COMMITTEE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AS WELL AS BUDGETS OF FIVE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS ABOUT GETTING AN ATTORNEY IN APPROPRIATE PLACES WHICH IS WHY I THINK THIS IS A VERY. APPROPRIATE BELT RIGHT THANK YOU- MR GABRIEL YOU MAKE CLOTHES YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CARE FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THE FOR THE THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS ALL JUST SAY. A COUPLE THINGS ONE OBVIOUSLY VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THIS DIALOGUE WITH THE OPPOSITION IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN THIS PROPOSAL MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY I'M CERTAINLY VERY OPEN TO THAT FEEDBACK AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I DID WANT TO NOTICE AS THE CHAIR NOTED YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENTS. AGAINST THIS PROGRAM ARE ARE REALLY EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO EVERY EVERY SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE'S REPRESENTED AN ATTORNEY EVERY CASE THAT I HANDLED AS AN ATTORNEY IN PRIVATE PRACTICE. THERE'S A DISPUTE ABOUT THE SCOPE OF DISCOVERY ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER IS Q. THE OTHER SIDE OF TRYING TO DELAY THE PROCESS. SO TO ME THOSE ARE ISSUES ABOUT OUR CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND THE RULES OF JUDICIAL MINISTRATION AND NOT SPECIFIC. TO THIS PROGRAM A PART OF WHAT I THINK CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPOSITION IS ONE OF THE EXAMPLES THAT THEY GAVE OF A DELAY TACTIC WAS REQUESTING A JURY TRIAL. THAT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFINING FEATURES OF OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IF YOU LOOK AT ARTICLE ONE SECTION SIXTEEN OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION IT TALKS ABOUT. THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. SO THESE ARE NOTIONS THAT ARE DEEPLY EMBEDDED IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE EXPRESSING CONCERN ABOUT FOLKS EXERCISING FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THE OTHER THING THAT I WOULD SAY HERE IS WE HAVE A REALLY UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW. IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT MONEY THAT'S COMING FROM WASHINGTON DC BOTH IN THE CARRIAGE ACT AND ALSO WHAT IS BEEN PROVIDED FOR THE ROOT MERICAN RESCUE PLAN. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS. TO BUILD UP. OUR RIGHT TO COUNSEL PROGRAMS TO BUILD UP OUR VISION DEPENDS PROGRAMS. THIS IS POTENTIALLY A ONCE IN A. GENERATION OPPORTUNITY. AND THERE'S GUIDANCE FROM THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT THAT SPECIFICALLY SAYS. THAT MONEY FROM WASHINGTON DC CAN BE USED FOR THESE TYPE OF PROGRAMS. AND WE KNOW FROM ALL OF THE INDEPENDENT DATA AND ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH. THAT THERE IS AN EXTRAORDINARY RETURN ON INVESTMENT TO TAXPAYERS FROM DOING THAT SO. WITH THAT I WOULD. APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED KOLEL PLEASE. STONE HI STONE AYE.

SO THOSE ARE BOTH BILLS ARE OUT THAT IS AB NINE NINE THREE PATTERSON AND AB TEN SEVENTY NINE GALLAGHER WRITES ITEM NUMBER ONE AB TEN TWENTY MINS FRIEDMAN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR ALL YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE TWELVE. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO OUR PREDECESSORS IN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED TWO KEY REFORMS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AT RISK FOR FINANCIAL DEVASTATION BOTH THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT AND THE FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT WERE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE BASIC CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND DEBT COLLECTIONS AND TO ALSO INCREASED PATIENT AWARENESS FOR FREE AND DISCOUNTED MEDICAL CARE FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE. HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA UNDER CURRENT LAW HAVE TO PROVIDE CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES AND ARE UNINSURED OR UNDER INSURED THIS CONSISTS OF FULL PAYMENTS ARE PARTIAL PAYMENTS DEPENDING ON THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION. THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING I PROVIDES THE MINIMUM GUIDELINES TO HELP HOSPITALS HAVE TO FOLLOW WHEN THEY OFFER THIS CHARITY CARE AS WELL AS HOW THEY CAN GO AFTER ANY UNPAID DEBT A DEBT COLLECTORS IN CALIFORNIA ALSO HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SAME RULES. IT ALSO PROVIDES PROTECTIONS TO PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE COLLECTIONS PROCESS THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTY TIME PERIOD BEFORE A HOSPITAL OR COLLECTION AGENCIES CAN REPORT THEIR ACCOUNT TO A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY OR TO START CIVIL ACTIONS AGAINST THE PATIENT. HOWEVER DESPITE THESE PROTECTIONS AND DESPITE THE LAW THERE ARE HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THESE RULES THAT ARE NOT TELLING THE PATIENT ABOUT THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR CHARITY CARE AND THAT ARE ALSO SENDING THAT THEIR INFORMATION RIGHT OFF TO COLLECTION AGENCIES WHICH IS A DEVASTATING TO THE PATIENTS HI THERE HOW KAISER HEALTH NEWS REPORTED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THAT NONPROFIT HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA'S COULD HAVE BUT DID NOT PROVIDE A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS INSTEAD THEY WERE AFTER THESE PAY. WERE UNABLE TO PAY. FOR THOSE SUPPOSED TO DEBTS. THE PATIENT'S REPORT BEING DISHED CHARGE ARE RECEIVING MEDICAL BILLS WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. OR HOW THEY COULD APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS AND TO PROTECT THESE VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ONLY. ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BUT A LOT OF TIMES OR THE WORST TIME OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN SICK. SO THEY'RE REALLY NOT ABLE TO FIGHT THE SYSTEM SO THIS BILL WILL STRAIGHT FROM THE STATE ENFORCEMENT OVERSIGHT OF A HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT. BY PENALIZING HOSPITALS THAT DON'T FOLLOW THE LAW. IT WILL PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BILLS AND ABOUT HOW THEY CAN APPLY FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS LIKE MELIK MEDIC CAL. AS WELL AS CHARITY CAL AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE AND ALSO WHEN THE BILL IS SENT TO COLLECTIONS. BUT IT'S POSSIBLE SOME SELLING PATIENT DATA SOMETHING THAT TOO MANY OF THEM ARE STILL DOING. START SELLING PATIENT DEBT. IT EXTENDS ADVERSE CREDIT REPORTING A COMMENCEMENT OF CIVIL ACTIONS FROM A HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS AFTER INITIAL BILLING. REMEMBER A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE LAID UP AND NOT EVEN ABLE TO OPEN THEIR MAIL. REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS TO CERTIFY THAT THE PATIENT HAS BEEN SCREENED FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE THEY FILE A LAWSUIT. AND IT RAISES THE INCOME LEVEL FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM 310050% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL 24100% OF THE POVERTY LEVEL. FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH A CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE. AND WE HAVE AGREED WITH THEM ON A BASIC- FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE AND WILL CONTINUE TO IRON OUT DETAILS AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORWARD INTO ASSEMBLY HEALTH. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT THIS MORNING OR TRACY DOUGLAS WITH BED SADEQ LEGAL SERVICES AND MONIQUE DAVIS WHO IS A PATIENT WHO WANTS TO SHARE HER STORY WITH YOU TODAY. RESHAPE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN I HAVE THREE WITNESSES LISTED TRACY DOUGLAS OF PETS ACT. MANY DAY WITH AN INDIVIDUAL GEN FLORI FROM THE WESTERN CENTER LAW POVERTY WHO IS THEY'RE ALL THREE ON THE TELEPHONE THIS FLOOR IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS SO. WE'LL START WITH TRACY DOUGLAS. MORNING THANK YOU ARE WILL MEMBERS THAT SENATE IS A NONPROFIT LEGAL AID ORGANIZATION AND WE ARE PROUD TO CO SPONSOR AB TEN TWENTY. LET ME CLEAR CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS ARE NOT PROVIDING CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY COULD AND ARE ALSO NOT TELLING PATIENTS ABOUT ITS AVAILABILITY. MEDICAL DEBT HAS DEVASTATING EFFECTS YOU CAN SEND PEOPLE INTO POVERTY THEY CAN LIVE THEIR HOUSING PRODUCTION AND FOR CLOSURE THE STRESS FROM DEBT PILING UP COLLECTION CALLS FROM WRITTEN HELP. ANYWHERE THINKING THE FORCED TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY MEDICAL DEBT IS THE LEADING CONTENT. THE CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY. EIGHT TEN TWENTY PROVIDE PUT FOR PATIENTS AND NUMBER OF WAYS. INCREASES ELIGIBILITY 24100% A THIRD PARTY LINE. I REQUIRED NOTICE OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES BY HOSPITAL IN DEBT COLLECTORS EDUCATION. REQUIRES DEBT COLLECTORS TO SHOW THAT THE PATIENT HAS ITS CREAM FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND FIND IT HIGHLY A LOT THEY- AND IT BANNED THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEBT TO DEBT BUYERS FOR THE HOSPITALS RETAIN. CONTROL OVER THE DEATH. MY CLIENT TO STATE BILL ARE SENIORS WHO HAD EMERGENCY CARE WE NEED SURGERIES CURRENTLY. AND NO TO THE HOT EVER LET THEM KNOW THAT CHARITY CARE. THEY WERE FORCED ENOUGH TO BE REFERRED TO LEGAL AID FOR HEALTH. IT SHOULD NOT ME AND IT'S TO THEM TRAINING ISSUES AS AN OPTION. THE FINANCIAL PROCESS NOT BE OPAQUE HARD TO GET IT SHOULD BE READILY AVAILABLE. THAT IS NOT THE ONLY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS NORTH A PROBLEM MY COLLEAGUES FROM OTHER LEGAL SERVICES REPORT SEEING THE SAME ISSUE. AFTER ALL THERE CAN COLLECTIONS THE PANDEMIC YOU CAN EXPECT THAT MEDICAL DEBT WILL INCREASE. THE TIME HAD COME TO STRENGTHEN THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT SO THAT EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE AN ATTORNEY BENEFIT FROM IT AB INTENDED. THIRTY THREE CAN RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE MONIQUE DAVIS. I LIVE IN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SIXTY FIVE AND SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY JAIL. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A RARE BONE MARROW DISORDER I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE AND I WAS AT THE TIME OF MY LIFE AND CAREER I WAS TREATED OVER FIVE SEPARATE HOSPITALS BEFORE I WAS. BEFORE I WAS AT THE- PART OF THE HOSPITAL AND RECEIVED CHEMOTHERAPY AND A STEM CELL TRANSPLANT THAT WAS REQUIRED. MULTIPLE TIMES OWES US TO THE HOSPITAL IN AN EMERGENCY. EACH TIME I WAS ADMITTED AND STAYED AT LEAST A WEEK OR MORE. I WAS SEEN AT UC IRVINE. I'M A MEDICAL LA PALMA THE COMMUNITY MEMORIALCARE ORANGE COAST MEDICAL CENTER ANAHEIM REGIONAL WEST ANAHEIM MEDICAL CENTER. I WOULD VERY. DEFINITELY SET FOR OVER A YEAR AND A HALF. IN N. OUT OF HOSPITALS AND NOT RECEIVING CORRECT TREATMENT. EACH TIME BEING SENT HOME WITHOUT THE PROPER DIAGNOSIS AND ACCUMULATING MORE AND MORE MEDICAL THAT. I COULD NOT WORK MY HUSBAND HAD TO TAKE TEMPORARY LEAVE FROM THAT SPORT TO CARE FOR ME. WHILE AT MEMORIAL CARE THEY TOLD MY HUSBAND TO BORROW MONEY FROM FAMILY MEMBERS AND PAY OUT OF POCKET BEFORE THEY WILL CONTINUE MY TREATMENT. NONE OF THE HOSPITALS INFORMED US OF ANY POTENTIAL FINANCIAL HELP. WE STARTED TO RECEIVE NUMEROUS HOSPITAL BILLS IN THE MAIL AND PHONE CALLS THEY WOULD CALL ME WHILE STILL IN THE HOSPITAL. THEY WILL CALL. MY HUSBAND AT WORK AND DEMAND PAYMENT. WE WERE SCARED ALSO AND- AT TIMES THOUGHT NAY IT WOULD BE IF I DIED. IN MY HOUSE WOULD NOT HAVE. THE ADDED STRESS OF FINANCIAL BURDEN OF ME. THE BILL'S MOUNTED AND THE CALL THE PRIEST THEY TURNED US OVER TO COLLECTION AGENCIESAND REPORTING NEGATIVE CREDIT ACTIVITY. THIS HAS IMPACTED MY ABILITY TO GAIN NEW EMPLOYMENT AS A NONPROFIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES EXECUTIVE. WAS IT MY FAULT I BECAME ILL ISN'T. IT MORE MONEY MORE IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE. IT WAS NOT UNTIL I CONTACT THE PUBLIC LAWCENTER THAT ACCOUNT OUT THAT I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN HELP BUT THE HOSPITAL BILLS TO REDUCE MY BILLS OFFER ME A PAYMENT PLAN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION OF BILL EIGHTY TEN TWENTY. I THANK YOU IN WOULD YOU IDENTIFY YOURSELF FOR A RECORD PLEASE. MY NAME IS MONIQUE DAVIS THANK YOU THANK YOU.

NOTED AND THAT IS BARBARA GLAZER FROM THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WHO IS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. MORNING. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO HAVE A POSITION OF OPPOSED THE LAST AMENDED HOWEVER HE HA DOES SUPPORT MANY OF THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN EIGHTY TEN TWENTY SUCH AS INCREASING THE ELIGIBILITY COMPORT CHARITY CARE FROM THAT FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. WE APPRECIATE MLA BEING TAKEN TODAY AND COMMITTEE THEY DO DEAL WITH SOME OF OUR CONCERNS WE HAVE SOME REMAINING ISSUES HAVING TO DO WITH OVERLAPPING REGULATORY AUTHORITY AND THE LEVEL OF THE PINE. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE AND THE FONG AND I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THE DIFFERENCES TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. RIGHT WE WILL NOW OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE MEMBER THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN TWENTY OPERATOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN TWENTY FIRST ONE THEN ZERO. AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TEN TWENTY FIRST WHAT'S ONE. ZERO NOW. AND AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IT'S KILEY. GOOD MORNING SO I AM MENTIONING IS THAT YOU'RE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE SEES ME IF EITHER YOU ARE UNINSURED OR HAVE HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND YOUR INSURED YOU KNOW- OR ANY OF THE WITNESSES SORT OF WHAT'S THE MORE COMMON SITUATION WHICH CHARITY CARE IS USED AS IT IS A PRETTY ON SHERMAN INSURANCE. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION- MAYBE ONE OF THE MAYBE THAT SETBACK- WITNESS MIGHT NOW. JENNIFER LAURIE I CAN SPEAK TO THAT ISSUE FROM WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY- WE DO FIND THAT MORE OFTEN PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED ARE SCREENED FOR CHARITY CARE BUT NOT ALL OF THE TIME. IT CAN BE HARDER TO IDENTIFY UNDER INSURED PATIENTS. PARTICULARLY PATIENTS WHO HAVE HIGH DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH PLANS OFTEN WHAT THEY NEED IS JUST AND REASONABLE PAYMENT PLAN WHICH IS ALSO PART. OF THE HOSPITAL CARE PRICING ACT AND SO THEY HAD THAT INFORMATION AND THEY KNEW HOW TO GET THAT PAYMENT PLAN THEY WOULD BE GREATLY BENEFITED. OKAY I GUESS I BELIEVE UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW NOW RELEASED AS OF. THIS YEAR LAST YEAR YOUR ACTION REQUIRED TO BE INSURED AND IF YOU DON'T GET INSURANCE THEN YOU'RE- PENALIZED- FOR THAT BUT THEN WE ALSO HAVE A POLICY WHERE YOUR- GIVEN- REDUCED- YOU KNOW COSTS IF YOU. ARE NOT FOLLOWING THAT MANDATE AND GO TO THE HOSPITAL SERVICES COULD TRYING TO GET MY MIND OR HOW HOW THESE POLICIES SORT OF IT TOGETHER. WELL I CAN CERTAINLY CAN SPEECH EVERY CASE IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE. AT THEIR HEALTHCARE THAT'S EXCESSIVE THAT'S THE PORTABLE FOR THEM- OR THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE OR MEDICAID ALL. AND SOMETIMES IT'S A QUESTION OF THE HOSPITALS PROVIDING INFORMATION HELPING THEM SIGN UP AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MANY OF THESE HOSPITALS ARE NOT DOING. THEY'RE NOT HELPING THEM NAVIGATE THAT SYSTEM TO GET THEM TO GET THE INSURANCE- BUT IT IF YOU'RE ASK AT SO. AS TO WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT KNOW ABOUT INSURANCE. AND NOT HAVE IT SOMETIMES THEY MAYBE FEEL THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT- EVEN WITH THE SUBSIDIES- I HAVE FOUND JUST ANECDOTALLY THAT WHEN I'VE TOLD PEOPLE ABOUT THE SUBSIDIES ARE AVAILABLE UNDER CALIFORNIA A LOT OF PM PEOPLE HAD NO IDEA. THEY HAD NO IDEA THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDY AND THAT THE BUT THERE IS INSURANCE OUT THERE THAT THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT'S AFFORDABLE. SO I THINK THOSE ARE SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE WHO FIND THEIR WAY. INTO THE SITUATION. BUT I'M JUST GUESSING I. I DON'T HAVE THE ONE ON ONE EXPERIENCE THAT WESTERN CENTER MIGHT HAVE THEY MIGHT GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT ANSWER. YEAH THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME DID YOU WANT TO ADD ANYTHING OTHER WHEN THE SUN ON THE PHONE. AT I WOULD SAY ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE AND THEN EVEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INSURED YOU KNOW WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR JOB AND THEY LOSE THEIR INSURANCE IT CAN TAKE SOME TIME BEFORE THEY GET INTO A NEW PROGRAM. OKAY LET'S NOT MAKE SENSE TO ME I'M GONNA SUPPORT YOUR BILL I JUST WANT TO KIND OF POINT OUT IT. AND SOMETIMES THE IRONY OF IT. YOU KNOW WE'RE PROVIDING THIS- RELIEF BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF. FINANCIALLY PUNISHING THESE VERY SAME PEOPLE- IF THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THE STATE'S MANDATE SO THAT MAYBE SOMEONE WILL LOOK AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE QUESTION. WELL WE ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A MANDATE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE. THAT WE'RE NOT COVERING THREE OR FOUR MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SO. THERE IS NOT COMPLETE COVERAGE. FOR THE GOVERNOR WHO MAY BE SUBJECT TO THIS SO. SORRY AND THAT GAP IS LARGE I HAVE I HAVE BLUE CROSS YEARS AGO PRETTY GOOD INSURANCE PLAN AND WHEN I WENT WENT THROUGH A YEAR OF CHEMOTHERAPY I ENDED UP WITH TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT. AND IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE IT IS REALLY HARD FOR ME TO PAY THAT SO EVEN PEOPLE THAT HAVE SUPPOSEDLY GOOD INSURANCE GOING VERY HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS. IT'S A TRAP. IT OUT. I JUST WANT TO GAUGE SIZE AND THE- OF THE PROBLEM. NOW IF- MAYBE A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR THE- WITNESSES. A FOOTFALL- THE ACT- THAT IS THE- OF THIS PARTICULAR. ALL OF THE HOSPITAL FAIR PRICING ACT APPLIES TO BOTH. NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AS WELL AS A FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS IS THAT CORRECT. I BELIEVE SO OKAY. NOW IT'S BEEN CITED THAT- IN TWENTY NINETEEN- THE AMOUNT. OF UP- THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBT. INCURRED BY THE- NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WAS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THAT COULD HAVE BEEN- PROVIDED TO. PATIENTS WAS A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THE- DOLLAR AMOUNT. WAS FOR LET'S SAY FOR PROFIT ALSO HOSPITALS. I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT MY FINGERTIPS IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION I'M ASSUMING THAT THEY WERE JUST STARTING THIS PARTICULAR COHORT OF HOSPITALS IN THIS PARTICULAR STUDY- I WILL ASK IF ANY OF THOSE SPONSORS HAPPEN TO HAVE THAT DATA AVAILABLE. OR IF WE EVEN KNOW. AT EMPLOYEE I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS AVAILABLE BUT IT THE DATA IS THERE AND NONPROFIT AND FOR PROFIT HOSPITALS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SIMILAR IN- HOW THEY ARE BOTH PROVIDING CHARITY CARE AND THE AMOUNT OF CHARITY CARE THAT THEY'RE LEAVING ON THE TABLE. YEAH AND THE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WAS THAT JUST FOR ONE YEAR THE TWENTY NINETEEN THAT WAS JUST FOR TWENTY NINETEEN NINETY OKAY AND JUST FOR THE NONPROFIT HOSPITALS GOT IT. OKAY THANK. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS IS DAVIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU- QUESTION I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL LAWS ON. A PENALTY AGAINST THE HOSPITALS- IF THEY BUILD THE PATIENT WRONGLY. AND DOESN'T ALLOW THEM TO APPEAL IS THAT CORRECT. WELL WE'RE STILL WORKING ON WHAT THE ACTUAL PENALTY. PART OF THE SCHOOL WILL BE THAT'S. WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ABOUT- WE SIR WANTED TO. MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A REAL READ TO FOLLOW THE LAW- YOU KNOW THAT HAVE ENOUGH OF. TO MAKE THEM THINK TWICE- AND TO SET UP. A FULL IN THEIR OWN HOSPITALS COMPLY TO REALLY SURE THAT THIS AND- IS BEING PER. TO PAY PATIENTS. OUR GOAL IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE IT'S REALLY TO GET THE HOSPITAL'S INTO COMPLIANCE. IN AND I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERN ON THAT ALSO DO WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF PENALTY WOULD BE AND- IF SO WHERE DOES THAT PENALTY GOING HOUSE TO BE USED. WE'RE LOOKING AT A SLIDING SCALE SO THE FIRST OFFENSE OF COURSE WOULD BE MUCH LOWER AND THEN THE MAXIMUM OFFENSE WORD WORLD TALKING ABOUT NUMBERS AROUND THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR MARK. AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT IT'S HARD TO PUT A PENALTY NUMBER ON AN ACTION THAT COULD LITERALLY RUIN SOMEONE'S LIFE. I WANT A PATIENT FEELS THAT THEY'D RATHER BE DEAD. THAN PUT THEIR FAMILY THROUGH- ECONOMIC RUIN- IF SOMEONE'S HOUSE IS TAKEN AWAY IF THEY ARE UNABLE TO GET A JOB IF THEY CAN'T GET A LOAN ANYMORE FOR THEIR CHILD- BECAUSE OF MEDICAL THAT THEY SHOULDN'T OF ACCRUED IN THE FIRST PLACE IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT THE FAIR NUMBER IS FOR THE HOSPITAL. BUT THAT'S WE'RE WORKING WITH THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ON AN AD I THINK THAT'S MY CONCERN IS YOU KNOW EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES- SO I'D HATE TO SEE YOU KNOW A FINE COME AGAINST SOMEONE THAT ACCIDENTALLY MADE A MISTAKE WHEN THEY WERE BILLING SOMETHING- AND- YOU KNOW IF THEY DO ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL- TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THAT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T. INTENTIONAL I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN AND I AGREE WITH YOU- SOMETIMES THINGS SLIP THROUGH THE CRACKS BUT IF YOU HAVE A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN WHEN YOU'RE JUST IN YOUR NONPROFIT HOSPITAL SECTOR. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS STILL CLEARLY THE HOSPITALS NEED TO SYSTEMICALLY LOOK AT THE PROCESSES. AND SO. IT'S HOW IT LOOKS TO ME IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT MECHANISMS JUST-IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY SINGLE PATIENT WHO DESERVES- THIS RELIEF IS GETTING IT. SO HOPEFULLY THIS WILL PUSH THEM TO SET UP THOSE MUCH MORE. ROBUST SORTS OF PROCEDURES AND MAKE THE IT'S MUCH MORE ROUTINE. FOR THEM TO CHECK FOR. THE SAME WITHOUT. IF YOU HAVE A FEVER IF YOU HAVE AN INFECTION BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL THEY SHOULD BE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN PAY YOUR BILLS. AND FORGIVE ME IF YOU'VE YOU'VE ANSWERED THIS AGAIN WHERE WOULD THIS- WHERE WOULD THIS PENALTY GO TO- THAT I BELIEVE WOULD PROBABLY. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO DOUBLE CHECK WHAT'S IN THE TEXT OF THE BILL BUT I'M ASSUMING IT WOULD GO TO THE AGENCIES THE WAY THAT THESE. NORMALLY DUE TO CONTINUE pTHANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU THANKS FOR THE QUESTIONS STROKE. YEAH THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND I APPRECIATE THE ISSUE I MEAN I WAS ONE OF THE- LEGISLATORS WHO STOOD UP TO END SURPRISE BILLING- YOU KNOW WHEN THE BILL ACTUALLY FAILED. THE FIRST TIME- AND SO ON CERTAINLY NO ONE WHO. I'M CERTAINLY ONE WHO IS. SPOT ON THIS ISSUE IS CONCERNED ABOUT. HOSPITAL DEBT I THINK THER NEEDS TO BE MORE TRANSPARENCY IN PRICING- WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH CARE- BUT FOR ME ON. ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I THINK. THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT. OF POVERTY LEVEL IS ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITABLE CARE NOW- AND WE HAVE- PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO HELP INSURE THAT. THAT THOSE THINGS ARE FOLLOWED THERE ARE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL. IS IT ADDS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION- WHICH WE KNOW WILL AGAIN BE A TOOL FOR. ATTORNEYS TO SUE HOSPITALS- TO COST SOME ADDITIONAL DOLLARS- THERE'S A LOT ON THIS FRONT. AND MY CONCERN ESPECIALLY AS FOR RURAL HOSPITALS- HELLO MY DISTRICT HAVE BEEN THROUGH HELL- DURING COVERT NINETEEN- FIRST WITH THE- INITIAL SURGE IN SHUTTING DOWN THE HOSPITAL'S TO ELECTIVE PROCEDURES WHICH NEARLY KILLED- MANY OF MY RURAL HOSPITALS. AND I. AND I THINK IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL RECOVER- THEN TO ADD ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW POTENTIAL LIABILITY POTENTIAL LAWSUITS- YOU KNOW IF THEY DON'T FOLLOW EVERY IOTA- AND GIVE THE EXACT. THE EXACT NOTICES REQUIRED- THE MORE WE KEEP ADDING THESE KINDS OF THINGS IN PLACE WHEN THEY'RE- WHEN AGAIN. THERE ALREADY ARE A LOT OF PROTECT. PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR CHARITABLE- TERRIBLE KERR- THERE ARE ALREADY A LOT OF PROVISIONS IN PLACE TO HELP TO ENSURE. THAT THERE'S NOT SURPRISE BILLING AGAIN WE- THIS LEGISLATURE HELP ENSURE THAT. THAT HAPPENS- YEAH MUCH- YOU KNOW. AGAINST MANY AND HOW CARE STAY. WHO WERE NOT WHO DID NOT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN- BUT I JUST FEEL LIKE IN THIS AREA THERE'S ALREADY A LOT OF PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT AN ADDITIONAL LIABILITY BURDEN UPON HOSPITALS THEY'RE ALREADY. HAVING A HARD TIME MAKING IT THROUGH AS IT IS AND IF THERE IS NO HOSPITAL. AND SO MYERS THAT MEANS PEOPLE DON'T GET CARE THAT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH GREATER THREAT. TO THEIR HEALTH CARE- THEN. THEN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. UP VOTE THANK YOU FOR THE CONCERNS AND CERTAINLY THERE VERY VALID CONCERNS AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ALSO THAT THE IMMENSITY DID PUT AN APPEALS PROCESS IN. SO THE HOSPITALS DO HAVE A WAY OF APPEALING SAYING BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS GREAT SYSTEM IT'S JUST YOU KNOW THE PAPER GOT JAMMED IN THE PRINTER WHATEVER IT IS. THEY CAN SHOW THAT THERE IS A WAY THAT THEY CAN APPEAL ANY FINE AND AGAIN THE FINES WOULD START AT A YOU KNOW WHATEVER LOW LEVEL AND INCREASE. AND I WOULD JUST SAY THIS. HAVING PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS ARE NOT PROTECTIONS IF THE CONSUMERS ARE NOT NOTIFIED BY THE HOSPITALS THAT THEY EXIST. IF YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE WHO ARE SICK. WHO ARE MAYBE GOING THROUGH THE WORST WEEK OF THEIR LIFE WHO ARE AT A POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO. TO FIND THE STUFF OUT FOR THEMSELVES OR TO GO HIRE A LAWYER THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME. WHO ARE CLEARLY AND ARE VERY VULNERABLE STATE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE GOT TO TAKE IT UPON THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THOSE PROTECTIONS IF THEY DON'T DO THAT THE PROTECTIONS BECOME IRRELEVANT. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS SAYING WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE. WE HAVE OUR FREE LEGAL AID- OF THE PROVIDER SAYING WE HAVE A PROBLEM THESE PEOPLE. THE LUCKY ONES ARE FINDING THEIR WAY TO US AND THEN WE CAN HELP THEM BUT HOW MANY MORE. ARE JUST GOING BANKRUPT HOW MANY MORE ARE LOSING EVERYTHING WHEN THE PROTECTIONS THAT YOU HAD SET UP IN THAT IN THERE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET UP IS RIGHT THERE WAITING FOR THEM. IF THEY CAN'T ACCESS THAT IF THEY'RE NOT TOLD ABOUT IT THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO FIND THEIR WAY THERE. SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT BEING PUNITIVE TO THE HOSPITAL'S IT'S SAYING. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REPORT WAS DONE SHOWING THAT THIS CARE THE PEOPLE WERE OVER TOOL FOR WAS NOT GIVEN TO THEM. THEY'VE HAD NOW THREE YEARS TO FIX THE PROBLEM THEY HAVEN'T MOVED AND EVEN THE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION IS SAYING THEY AGREE THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY AND NOW WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT HOW TO THE PENALTIES WORK SO THAT THEY'RE NOT FUGITIVE. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. AND WE WANT TO MAKE THIS WORKABLE FOR HOSPITALS WE YOU KNOW WE WANT TO BE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM BUT WE ALSO WANT THEM TO MAKE THE SYSTEMIC CHANGES THAT THEY NEED. TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS. AND MY ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER SPECIFIC CONCERNS NO THERE WAS NOT A QUESTION IN THAT THERE WAS A STATEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU AND I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CAN WE TAKE THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES YES THANK YOU RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY SO I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A MOTION AND SECOND. SO WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO HEALTH COMMITTEE. CALDERON PLACE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NOW CHOW CHOW I TO.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE FOR HEARING AB FOUR NINE THIS MORNING. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THE BILL AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. AB FOUR NINE SIMPLY ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF OR WITNESSES OF GANG CRIMES TO BRING EVIDENCE OF A THREAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT IN ORDER TO HAVE THEIR NAMES REMOVED FROM PUBLIC RECORDS. RATHER THAN EXPANDING THE LIST OF CRIMES THAT ENTITLES A VICTIM TO HAVE THEIR NAME WITHHELD. THIS BILL SEEKS TO EMPOWER VICTIMS TO USE TOOLS THAT EXIST UNDER CURRENT LAW. FOR PROTECTING THEIR SAFETY AND ANONYMITY BY INFORMING THEM OF THEIR RIGHTS. IN A RECENT FAMOUS STUDY NEARLY 40% OF PARTICIPANTS. LISTED FEAR OF RETALIATION. AS A REASON THEY WOULD NOT REPORTED CRIME. FOR INFORMATION THEY KNOW ABOUT A CRIME. WE KNOW THAT GAIN CRIMES ARE NOTORIOUS FOR RETALIATES RETALIATION EFFORTS AND I KNOW THIS PERSONALLY. AND ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SOLVE. BY OFFERING THE COMMUNITY THIS SIMPLE PROTECTION WE CAN HELP FOSTER COOPERATION BETWEEN ITS MEMBERS AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT AB FOUR NINE DOES NOT PLACE ANY EXTRA BURDENS OR NEW PROCEDURES ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. ANY EMPLOYEE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO INFORM VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. THEIR NAME WILL BECOME PUBLIC RECORD UNLESS OTHERWISE REQUESTED. THIS BILL FOLLOWS THE SAME PROCEDURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I WOULD LIKE TO PASS IT OVER TO RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION WHO IS A WITNESS IN SUPPORT OF DIDN'T MAKE YOU CRY I DO HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED IN SUPPORT WHO'S WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE AND THAT IS RAIN SHERMAN FROM THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION.

THANK YOU MEMBERS IN RECENT YEARS THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATORS TAKING BOLD STEPS TO IMPROVE AND PROVIDE PATHWAYS TO JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED AB SIXTEEN NINETY NINETEEN WHICH EXTENDS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR ADULT VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT FROM TWO YEARS. TO TEN YEARS AFTER THE ASSAULT OR THREE YEARS AFTER DISCOVERING. IN TWENTY TWENTY THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SB THIRTY NINETY TWO WHICH EXTENDED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR SURVIVORS TO SEEK JUSTICE AGAINST A SPECIFIED ABUSER. WHO IS AN OBGYN AT UCLA- WHO COMMITTED SEXUAL ASSAULT AGAINST MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED WOMEN. BECAUSE THE STATE DOES NOT CURRENTLY INSURE SAFETY MEASURES FOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AT THE HANDS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. DESPITE DOCUMENTED INCIDENCES OF OFFICERS USING THEIR POWER AND AUTHORITY TO STOCK ARREST THREATEN TO RETALIATE AGAINST THEIR VICTIMS. ADDITIONAL SPECIFIC LEGISLATION IS URGENTLY NEEDED. AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FIVE EXTENDS THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR VICTIMS WHO WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER TO TEN YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED PERPETRATOR. WAS EMPLOYED AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF JUDGMENT IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHICHEVER IS LATER TO ALLOW SURVIVORS TO FILE A CIVIL CLAIM. TAKE THE CASE OF NO WHITE WINCHESTER WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED A TOTAL OF FIVE WOMEN INVOLVED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHILE SERVING AS ACTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT. NONE OF WOULD TESTERS VICTIMS SUED HIM NOR THE DEPARTMENT THAT EMPLOYED HIM WITHIN THE TIME FRAME ALLOWED. UNDER CURRENT LAW BECAUSE THEY VIEWED THAT THEIR LIFE WOULD BE AT RISK OF LIBERTY. ADDITIONALLY AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FIVE WILL OTHERWISE TIME BARRED CIVIL CASES TO MOVE FORWARD. MEMBERS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL IS NOT TO CAST JUDGEMENT OR SHAME ON LOST LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND I KNOW MANY OF WHOM. ARE GOOD UPSTANDING PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THEIR JOBS AND DOING THEM THE RIGHT WAY. BUT THIS BILL SIMPLY KNOWLEDGES THAT- INTIMIDATION AND BARRIERS TO REPORTING. THE VICTIM'S FACE WHEN THEY KNOW THEIR ATTACKER HAS THE ABILITY TO PUNISH ARREST OR RETALIATE AGAINST THEM. FROM A POSITION OF POWER. SUPPORTING THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS MORE TIME TO SAFELY COME FORWARD IF THEIR ABUSER HAS THE POWER TO THIRTY TO TAKE AWAY THEIR FREEDOM. AND LIBERTIES FOR SIMPLY TELLING THEIR STORY IN SEEKING JUSTICE. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY ARE SHERRY CARTER IN AT HOWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE.

A DARK AREA WHERE HE RAPED ME OVER AND OVER. WHAT CAN I DO CALL THE POLICE ON THE POLICE. APPARENTLY. I KNEW THEY MIGHT NEVER. I KNEW THEY MIGHT NEVER BELIEVE MIGHT NEVER BELIEVE ME BUT I COOPERATED FULLY WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM I TOLD THE TRUTH. AND OTHER VICTIMS HAVE THE SAME CHANCE THAT I DID. DURING THE CRIMINAL CASE I ANSWERED THE CALL EVERY TIME I NEEDED TO BE READY TO TESTIFY OR NEEDED TO BE PATIENT WITH MORE DELAYS OR NEEDED TO TELL THE JURY WILL. HAVE MY NAME HERE IN FRONT OF THE ATTACKER. AS HIS LAWYER TRIED TO MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A LIAR. CALIFORNIA DOES AGAINST MY ATTACKER WITH THE HELP OF HELP IN SACRIFICE TO MYSELF AND OTHER VICTIMS BUT- WHERE ARE WE AFTER ALL THIS. BECAUSE OF THE SHORT LEGAL DEADLINE RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO CIVIL JUSTICE FOR US. WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO SEEK COMPENSATION TO REMAIN HOME.

THE BILL DELETE OUTDATED AND OFFENSIVE TERMS SUCH AS A LAN WHICH IS FOUND THROUGHOUT OUR STATE LAWS AND REPLACES IT WITH APPROPRIATE LEGAL TERM AND KNOWLEDGE HE SUGGESTS- SEEM SIMPLE IT HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS ALTHOUGH THE TERM ALIEN HAS HISTORICALLY REFERRED TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE NON CITIZENS THE WORD HAS SINCE BEEN WEAPONIZED AND USED IN-PLACE OF AN EXPLICITLY RACIAL SLUR- THERE'S A DIRECT LINK BETWEEN WORDS AND ACTIONS. AND HISTORY HAS PROVEN THAT DEHUMANIZING LANGUAGE OFTEN PROCEEDS FILE ACTIONS AB TEN NINETY SIX INSURERS CALIFORNIA'S LAWS- CONSIST OF TERMINOLOGY THAT ALIGN WITH OUR IDEALS- TODAY UP TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT I HAVE BETH HOLTZMAN.

AS WE STRIVE TO THE BILL OUR FOUNDING MISSION TO SECURE JUSTICE AND FAIR TREATMENT TO ALL OUR GOAL IS A WORLD IN WHICH NO GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL SUFFERS FROM BIAS DISCRIMINATION OR HATE. ADL HAS ADVOCATED FOR FAIR AND HUMANE IMMIGRATION POLICY SINCE OUR FOUNDING AND I'VE BEEN THE LEADER IN EXPOSING ANTI IMMIGRANT AND ANTI REFUGEE HATE. THAT APPOINTMENT OUR NATION DEBATE. EMPLOYING THE OUTDATED TERM ALIEN TO DESCRIBE A PERSON IS DEHUMANIZING ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT EXPLICIT RACIAL SLUR IS BECOME A CODE WORD FOR BIGOTRY AGAINST IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. LANGUAGE SHAPE ATTITUDES USING TERMS LIKE ALIEN TO REFER TO A PERSON CAN LEAD TO PREJUDICE AND EVEN HARMFUL ACTION. AB TEN NINETY SIX PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE AROUND IMMIGRATION BY REMOVING THE TERM ALIEN FROM CALIFORNIA STATUTE AND REPLACING IT WITH MORE INCLUSIVE LEGAL TERMS.

NO MEDICARE THERE'S NO ONE ELSE COULD HEAL ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ARE FOR YOU CAN CLOSE THE LINES OVER YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS IS GONZALEZ. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL AND- I THINK LIKE SO MANY CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS- YOU KNOW WE LIVED OUR LIVES BEING TAUNTED WITH WITH TERMS THAT EVEN IN SCHOOL- TEACHERS WOULD OFTEN SAY IS A- ACCEPTABLE TERM IT'S A LEGAL TERM WE USE THAT TO WRITE BUT THE AMOUNT OF DEHUMANISATION THAT WAS PUT BEHIND THIS TERM IN USED IN WEAPONIZED AGAINST US AS CHILDREN. IS SOMETHING I THINK SO MANY OF US LIVE WITH SO I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT- THAT YOU CAN ADD DE LEGITIMIZE THE TERM BY TAKING IT OUT OF THE CODE AND IT'S BRILLIANT AND I HOPE THAT- THAT NO E. ON THE IMMIGRANTS OLDER IMMIGRANTS NOEL CHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS EVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH. I THINK THE PURE HATRED THAT SO MANY OF US FELT- GROWING UP WITH WITH THE UTILIZATION OF THIS TERM SO THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF THIS AND THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT- NOT SYMBOLIC BUT A VERY IMPORTANT ACT. IN ORDER TO- REMOVE IT FROM A LEGITIMATE TERM THAT'S USED. THANK YOU VISITORS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH- SOMEONE MEMBER RIVAS FOR BRINGING THIS. I AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ. THE WORDS WE USE MATTER TELLS US WHO AND WHAT WE VALUE. AND WHEN WE USE A WORD LIKE ALIEN IT'S CLEARLY USED TO SLANDER OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND TO NOT DENY THEIR HUMANITY. YOU'RE RIGHT AS DAUGHTER'S DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANTS- WE HEAR THIS WHERE THERE ARE PARENTS ARE ARE ARE DOCUMENTED OR UNDOCUMENTED YOU'RE AN IMMIGRANT AND IF THE WORD IS USED. SIMPLY TO DE HUMANIZE. OF MANY OF THE LATINO COMMUNITY KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE REFER TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED MEMBERS AS ALIENS. THEY'RE DOING SO BECAUSE I'LL BE LEGAL THEY'RE NOT DOING IT BECAUSE OF A LEGAL PREFERENCE THEY'RE DOING IT AS WAS SAID TO SLANDER AND TO HUMANIZE HUMANIZE AND TO REMIND TO SOMEBODY THAT THEY DON'T BELONG- IT'S ESPECIALLY TELLING US SINCE WE HAVEALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN USE AND I APPLAUD YOU FOR. MAKING SURE THAT OUR CODE OUR LAWS- REFLECTING THE ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE THAT CAN BE USED- I THINK REMOVED REMOVING IT FROM OUR FROM OUR LEXICON AND OUR OUR OUR LAWS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND HAVING YOU INTRODUCED THIS ALL RIGHT AGAIN I- I APPLAUD YOU FOR THIS AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO BE- IF YOU PERMITTED I'D LOVE TO BE INCLUDED AS A CO AUTHOR.

GOOD MORNING AB TWO SEVENTY TWO- WILL ENSURE THAT A VICTIM OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT CAN PURSUE A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST THE PERPETRATOR AND OTHER RELEVANT PARTIES AT THE NEED FOR THIS LEGISLATION IS DEMONSTRATED BY A RECENT CASE- IN THE LA AREA WHERE A STUDENT WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS BY HIS CHEMISTRY TEACHER. WHILE THE TEACHER WAS CRIMINALLY PROSECUTED AND DID SERVE JAIL TIME THE VICTIM'S CIVIL CLAIM WAS FORCED INTO ARBITRATION BY THE SCHOOL AS IT TURNED OUT- THE VICTIM'S PARENTS UPON AND ROLLING HIM I HAD ENTERED AN- ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT THAT INCLUDED AN ARBITRATION CLAUSE. NOW THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY- PARTIES IN ANY CASE WOULD SEE ARBITRATION AS A GOOD OPTION TO AGREED TO UP FRONT FOR RESOLVING CLAIMS THAT CAN BE- LESS EXPENSIVE FASTER AND MORE PRIVATE- HOWEVER THIS IS PREDICATED. ON THE MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES- IN ADVANCE AND I BELIEVE IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE- TO FORCE THE VICTIM OF A CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT IN ARBITRATION AGAINST THEIR WILL. NOW WHENEVER WERE DEALING WITH THE TOPIC OF ARBITRATION OF COURSE THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT IS AN OVERRIDING CONCERN OF PLACES- VERY FAR REACHING LIMITS ON THE ABILITY OF STATES- TO REGULATE THE ISSUE. HOWEVER I BELIEVE- THAT- THERE ARE SEVERAL FACTORS HERE- THAT BRING THIS LEGISLATION OUTSIDE OF THE EMBED OF F. A PREVENTION- FIRST IS- THE UNIQUE ROLE OF EDUCATION AS BOTH A RIGHT AND- AND SOMETHING THAT IS COMPULSORY YOU KNOW I'M LIKE CONTRACTS FOR SERVICES OR- OTHER BUSINESS VENTURES A STUDENT HAD DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO OPT OUT. OF THEIR EDUCATION CALIFORNIA OF ALL REQUIRES MINORS- TO RECEIVEAN EDUCATION- OF SOME KIND SECONDLY IT CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT IS NOT A FORESEEABLE ALL CIRCUMSTANCE. WHEN ENROLLING IN SCHOOL. WHEN PARENTS SIGN THEIR CHILD UP THE AGREED TO YOU KNOW NUMBER OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS SCHOOL HOURS TUITIONS DRESS CODES. AND SO FORTH BUT IT'S- UNFORESEEABLE AT THAT TIME THAT A PARENT WOULD I UNDERSTAND EIGHT CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT- TO BE WITHIN THE SCOPE. OF THE RISKS AT THE TIME OF ENTERING THE CONTRACT. THAT THIS BILL AB TWO SEVENTY TWO CLARIFIES AT THE FORCING A VICTIM OF CHILD SEXUAL ASSAULT INTO ARBITRATION- IS UNCONSCIONABLE AND UNCONSCIONABLE EDDIE- REMAINS. A GENERAL CONTRACT OFFENSE- EVEN UNDER- THE U. S. SUPREME COURT'S LEADING CASE ON THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT AT CONCEPCION- FINALLY- CALIFORNIA LAW IS CLEAR ON THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS- AFFORDED TO MINORS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES YOUR PERSONAL CASE LAW SUPPORTS. THAT CLAIMS HELD BY CHILDREN CANNOT BE FORCED AND ARBITRATION AND CHILDREN HAVE THE RIGHT TO DETERMINE AL MATTERS THAT CONCERN THEIR WELFARE ADDITIONALLY FAMILY CODE SECTION SIXTY SEVEN TEN PROVIDE THE CONTRACT. OF A MINOR MAYBE JUST A FIRM AND- BY THE MINOR. THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ITSELF DOES NOT SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF A PARENT'S ABILITY TO CONTRACTUALLY BIND I'M MINOR AND TO THEREBY FORCED THEM TO ENTER INTO ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE A CLAIM THOUGHTS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE- CAN ACT ON AT THE STATE LEVEL NOW FOR FUTURE VICTIMS IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE LEGISLATURE I TAKE ACTION ON THIS ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE MY FIRST WITNESS- WITH ME TODAY IS OUR ON THE LINE IS RICHARD SCHWARTZ. THANK YOU I HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED MISTER SCHWARTZ WHO IS AN ATTORNEY AT BROWN GEORGE RUSSELL BRAND ELLIS AND. REBECCA SCHWARTZ AN INDIVIDUAL. ARE EITHER OF YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND- COLLECTION RICHARD SHORT THERE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KILEY IN PARTICULAR MY NAME IS RICHARD SCHWARTZ A PARTNER AT BROWNE GEORGE ROSS O'BRIEN AND IGWE IN ALICE AND I URGE YOU ALL TO SUPPORT AB TWO SEVENTY TWO. EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THE VICTIMS OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT OR SEXUAL% BATTERY IN A SCHOOL CONTACTED EACH OTHER THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM EVEN IF THE SCHOOLS ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT WOULD OTHERWISE SPEND THAT STUDENTS ARBITRATION. RIGHT NOW CALIFORNIA LAW AUTHORIZES SCHOOLS TO FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO SIGN NON NEGOTIABLE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT. EGGMAN SOB AND HAVE QUALITY. AMONG OTHER THINGS. ALLOW THE SCHOOLS TO HIDE ITS DISPUTE BEHIND THE VEIL OF A CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. EVEN WHEN A STUDENT HAS CLAIMS BASED ON PROVEN FACT CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT. RECEIVE THE CALL CAN REQUIRED THROUGH FORCED ARBITRATION IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC FOR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. WHO DESPERATELY NEED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PROCEDURE THEIR SCHOOLS ARE TAKING OR FAILING TO TAKE TO PREVENT CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT ON THEIR PREMISES. EVEN MORE PROBLEMATIC IS THE IMPACT OF ARBITRATION ON A VICTIM OF CRIMINAL SEXUAL ASSAULT. CALIFORNIA LAW MAKES IT CLEAR THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN DECIDE A MATTER BEFORE THAT NOT ON THE BASIS OF THE LAW OR THE RULES OF EVIDENCE. BUT RATHER SOLELY ON AMBIGUOUS NOTIONS OF EQUITY AS PERCEIVED BY THAT ARBITRATOR OFTEN A SINGLE PERSON WITH HIS OR HER OWN BIASES AND PRECONCEPTIONS. THAT MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR CAN BLATANTLY IGNORE THE LAW AND PREVENT THE STUDENT WHO WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED FROM OBTAINING THE JUSTICE THEY COULD OBTAIN THROUGH THE COURTS. AB TWO SEVENTY TWO EXPECT THAT PROBLEM BY ALLOWING STUDENTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT AFTER BEING THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL ASSAULT. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT AB TWO SEVENTY TWO HAS A VERY NARROW SCOPE IT'S PROVISIONS ARE ONLY TRIGGERED WHEN THERE IS A WHEN THERE'S CRIMINAL SEXUAL MISCONDUCT THAT FORMED THE BASIS OF THE STUDENT QUITE. CALIFORNIA CAN FIX THIS LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWED COUNT THAT ALLOWS SCHOOLS TO EDUCATE THE COURT THAT THEM AND AVOID THE PUBLIC RECONCILIATION PROCESS THAT WOULD BE COMMUNITIES NEED TO HEAL ND MOVE ON. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION IN THIS IMPORTANT BELT WHICH WOULD GO A LONG WAY TO SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. I ASK YOU TO THE NUMBERS. TO VOTE I IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. THANK YOU. N. AS REBEKAH SHORT ONLINE. YES I AM THANK YOU GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE. I COME FORWARD WE CHOOSE TO STAND UP FOR THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY. TO LOWER THE RISK OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN BEING EXPOSED TO SEXUAL PREDATORS IN OUR SCHOOL. THIS HAS NOT BEEN A PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE. AMONG THE MANY UGLY TRUTH WE HAVE LEARNED ON THIS JOURNEY THAT MANY WOULD PREFER THIS ISSUE NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. THERE ARE FEW THINGS WORSE THAN HARMING A CHILD ONE THING I KNOW WITH WORK IS PREVENTING THAT CHARLTON SEEKING JUSTICE FOR THAT HARM. IGNORING THAT IT EVER HAPPENED. FOUR YEARS AGO ARCHIBALD WAS REPEATEDLY AND BRUTALLY RAPED BY A TEACHER AT BRENTWOOD SCHOOL IN LOS ANGELES NEARLY EVERY DAY FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS. THE PERPETRATOR WAS CRIMINALLY CONVICTED AND SERVED TIME. ARTS WORLD ISN'T PERMANENTLY CHANGED DAMAGES GUARD BY THIS YEAR BECAUSE I THOUGHT. THE ANGUISH PAIN AND MISERY COUPLED WITH THE LOSS OF INNOCENT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGING. HEIGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT OUR CHILD NEVER GOT THE PROVERBIAL DAY IN COURT. A JURY TRIAL WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE WAY TO BRING ABOUT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE CRIME AND THE SCHOOL POLICIES PROCEDURES GUIDELINES GOVERNANCE AND CULTURE WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIME. AND IN DOING SO WOULD FACILITATE THE HEALING PROCESS FOR OUR CHILD. INSTEAD THE CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM DENIED OUR TRIAL THE JURY TRIAL BECAUSE BRENT WOODS SCHOOL INCLUDED A MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSE IN ITS ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT. OUR CHILD TO NOT SIGN A MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IN YET WOULD HELP TO IT. MY HUSBAND AND I SIGNED THAT AGREEMENT BELIEVING THAT IT MOST ARBITRATION WOULD COVER GRIEVANCES WE MIGHT HAVE WITH THE SCHOOL REGARDING OUR CHILD'S EDUCATION. WE NEVER ENVISIONED IT WOULD COVER A FELONY CRIME A VIOLENT ONE AT THAT. AND WE CERTAINLY NEVER ENVISIONED THAT WE WERE SIGNING AWAY OUR CHILD RIGHT TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN PATH TO JUSTICE. NO. PARENT DOES OR SHOULD. THE COMMONSENSE PARENTS JUST EITHER. IF AT ALL. IS INTO TO REDUCE THIS RELATED TO ATTEND A SCHOOL I CAN CRIMINAL A GREAT ART ON. ARBITRATIONS HAD PLACE A CIVIL JEFF SYSTEM BUT A WICKS VICTIM SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE ARBITRATION OR COURT. FINALLY ARBITRATION CLAUSE TO AN EDUCATOR SEXUAL ABUSE OF A CHILD AT THE POTENTIAL TO UNDERMINE ANY CHANCE A TRUE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ARBITRATION THAT IS FORCING CONFIDENTIAL AND UPROARIOUSLY LIMITS DISCOVERY AND DISCLOSURE IS NOT ONLY BAD FOR THE SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS BUT ALSO FOR SOCIETY. IT INSULATES THE INSTITUTION FROM PUBLIC SCRUTINY LEADING SCHOOLS LEFT COMPELLED TO TRULY SELF REFLECT AND MAKE THE NECESSARY REFORMS TO PREVENT THESE CRIMES AND PROTECT FUTURE VICTIMS. ALL ADULTS WORK IN A SCHOOL HAVE A STICKER INSCRIBED LEGAL DUTY TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN. WHEN SEX CRIMES TAKE PLACE IN THE SCHOOL CONTEXT EVERYONE AGREES THAT SOMETHING HAD GONE HORRIBLY WRONG. WHAT SHOULD THOSE ONES GO UNINVESTIGATED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PARENTS AGREEING NOT TO SUE THE SCHOOL FOR GRADES ARE PARKING. REGARDLESS OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION OF ANY CLOGGING THE COURTS SHOULD SEX CRIMES AGAINST SCHOOL CHILDREN SPEAK AUTOMATICALLY COVERED BEHIND THE CLOAK OF CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION. AT THE WHITE LONG CITIZENS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE ASK HOW WE DID ACCEPTABLE THAT UNDER CURRENT LAW AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SIGNED BY PARENTS OF THE REQUIRED CONDITION FOR THE CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL CAN OPERATE THE HIGH TECH CRIME OR OTHER HIGH FELONIES. BEHIND CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION WE IMPLORE YOU TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLE BY TAPPING AB TWO SEVEN TWO INTO LAW PREVENTS SCHOOLS FROM FORCING RAPE VICTIMS INTO ARBITRATION BASED ON DECEPTIVE AND WANTED THE CREAMY. HAVING AB TWO SEVEN FOUR THE BOOKS WILL LAW WAY TOWARD HELPING OUR CHILD FEEL BY KNOWING OTHER CHILDREN WILL NOT BAKER SIMILARLY PAINFUL SACRAMENTO AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING. THANK YOU OPERATOR WHICH INTEL THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR AB TWO SEVENTY TWO WILL TAKE NAME. AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO SEVENTY TWO CONTRACTS ONE THEN ZERO AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE ONLINE NUMBER AND HE BACK INTO Q.

I THANK YOU TELL YOUR BALANCE THE CAPITOL RESOURCE INSTITUTE- IN SUPPORT. AND AT THIS TIME MEDICARE WE HAVE NO ONE ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU. REMOVED OPPOSITION I HAVE ONE LISTED OPPOSITION WITNESS ROBERT MUTRIE OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM INTERJECTED MORNING MORNING. IT'S FAR WILL IT ROBERT MCCREE FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO ALL UP FRONT I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WE IN NO WAY CONDONE ANY FORM OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND MOST CERTAINLY CONDEMN- THE ACT WERE DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY BUT INDIVIDUALS CERTAINLY SHOULD BE PROSECUTED AT BY THE HERE THAT- INDIVIDUAL LOT- ALSO OPPOSITION IS NOT BASED ON ANYTHING TO COMICS THEIR SCHOOLS- THAT'S NOT WHY WE ARE. IN A POSITION TODAY OUR SOLE CONCERN HERE AT ARBITRATION ILLEGAL SANDERS THE JURISPRUDENCE AROUND IT- I THANK STOP WITH A THOROUGH ANALYSIS ON THE POINT- SIMPLY PUT AS TOO SIMILAR TO THE BILLS FROM LAST YEAR- WE BELIEVE THIS IS PREEMPTED AND APPRECIATE THE OFFICE AWARE THAT THAT THE FAA HERE- BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE EXCEPTIONS ARE THE ACTIONS OF THE FACTORS IDENTIFIED BY NUMBER KILEY INSTANT COMMENT. ALL RECOGNIZING THE RELEVANT JURISPRUDENCE- THE GENERAL CASE MATTER AT&amp;T MOBILITY CONCEPCION- THERE THE CUTS THE COURT SPOKE QUITE CLEARLY THE FAA PERMIT AGREEMENTS TO ARBITRATE TO BE INVALIDATED BY QUOTE GENERALLY APPLICABLE CONTRACT SPENT SUCH AS FRAUD DIRECTOR UNCONSCIOUS BUT NOT BY THE FACT THAT THAT APPLY ONLY TO ARBITRATION OR DRIVE THEIR MEANING. TO THE FACT THAT AGREEMENT ARBITRATED ISSUE. WE DO THIS LEGISLATION AT THE TO THE THAT I DEPEND TO GIVE IT TO OUR WHICH- AND- A- THROUGH CORN CONTENT YEAH- AT THAT'S NOT CLEAR WE AGREED EXAMPLE OF TOMORROW IS AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY INTO FOURTEEN WHICH TO. WHAT PREDATOR ARBITRATION FOR PARTICULAR TYPE OF CLAIM THERE SO RIGHTS ADJUSTER ALSO. ORTON BUT THEY ARE AND I THINK THIS NOW KNOWS THAT HELP WILL PUBLIC HELD. IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO REVIEW THAT DECISION AT BEST HE WAITED PATIENTLY JUST PATTED ME NOW WITH AND OUR LETTER- SO. WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL DOES EXACTLY ABSOLUTE CONSIDER TO THOSE CASES IT IS PREEMPTIVE AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY APPROACHED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ARE PRETTY MUCH OPEN LINES FOR ANYONE ELSE. TO REGISTER OPPOSITION TO AB TWO SEVENTY TWO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR INTERMENT IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO PERFECT ONE THEN ZERO AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB. TWO SEVENTY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE TO ZERO NOW. AND THAT IS HOW MUCH THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE Q. RIGHT. THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LINES OF BRING IT BACK TO. THE COMMITTEE AND MR KILEY IS THIS BILL WENT THROUGH LAST YEAR TOO I THINK WE NOTED THAT. I CERTAINLY WISH YOU SUCCESS WITH THIS WE'VE BEEN LONG PROBING. THE BOUNDARIES OF ARBITRATION WHICH DO END UP WITH SOME PRETTY UNCONSCIONABLE RESULTS AND IF THIS IS A PATH TO HELPING. DELINEATE HOW WE CAN BETTER THINK OF WHERE A STATE MAY ENTER THIS CONVERSATION- THE BETTER OFF I THINK WE ALL ARE SO I AM VERY HOPEFUL THAT. THIS BILL WILL BE ABLE TO HELP ESTABLISH SOME OF THOSE BOUNDS. AS AS WELL AS A POINTS OUT. THE WE'VE ALSO. DONE WORK AROUND SECRET SETTLEMENTS IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND TRIED BECAUSE OF THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT OF. KEEPING THAT INFORMATION AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC WHO NEED TO BE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SOME OF THESE. SETTLEMENTS ARE HAPPENING AND HAPPENING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC THEN NOT ALERTING THE PUBLIC OF THE DANGERS OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION SO. I CERTAINLY WISH YOU WELL WITH THIS BILL AND- HOPE THAT IT WILL MOVE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS AMID GONZALEZ. GRAYSON KALRA. I JUST WANNA AGREE WITH THE CHAIR- I THINK WHAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE ON I'M ON RECORD THOUGH THAT I DISAGREE WITH THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS IS- UNIQUE ONLY TO SCHOOLS AND CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. ALTHOUGH IT IS- DEPLORABLE IN PROBABLY THE MOST. EGREGIOUS OF CASES- ARBITRATION HIDES SERIAL ABUSERS IN EVERY FORM IN THE WORK PLACE IN SCHOOLS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND IT IT BRINGS TO LIGHT. EXACTLY WHY ARBITRATION- CAN BE SUCH A FAILURE FOR VICTIMS THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO- AN ARBITRATOR DOES NOT HAVE TO BASE THEIR DECISION ON LAW IT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE SHOCKED ABOUT. NO MATTER WHAT THE CLAIM IS AND SO AS SOMEBODY WHO OBVIOUSLY HAS DONE BILLS- BOTH ON ARBITRATION AND EXTENDING THE TIME LIMIT FOR- INDIVIDUALS TO PURSUE CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIMS. THAT UP I WOULD LIKE COOPER THIS BILL I OF COURSE SUPPORTED- I'LL MOVE IT BUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT EVERYTHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP TODAY- IN RESPONSE TO THIS. POOR CHILD- AND- INABILITY TO GET JUSTICE COULD COULD BE MAGNIFIED BY. A WOMAN IN THE WORKPLACE COULD BE MAGNIFIED BY- YOU KNOW OTHER CHILDREN AT OTHER ACTIVITIES- OR OR EVEN ADULTS AND SO I JUST I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW THAT THAT- I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING TO NARROWLY TAILOR THIS TO STAND UP TO TRADITIONAL REVEALED. I THINK IT HIGHLIGHTS THE PROBLEM IN GENERAL WITH ARBITRATION SOUND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU WE HAVE A THAT IS A CO AUTHOR. WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THEIR SECOND ATTEMPT. IN A SECOND THANK YOU SERVICE RADIUS. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR INTO WAS GONZALEZ FOR THE COMMENTS I THINK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE WE ARE TELLING PEOPLE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHTS BEFORE YOU EVEN KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A RIGHT. AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN EIGHT EIGHT A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT WE HAVE DEALT WITH IN THE LAW- IN TRYING TO HELP VICTIMS AT THE END I AGREE THAT IF THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IT'S I APPLAUD IT AND I HOPE THAT IT DOESN'T GET STUCK IN EVEN THOUGH SENATE JUDICIARY LIKE LAST TIME BUT IT HAD TO DO WITH COVERT AS OPPOSED TO THE MERITS OF. OF THE BILL AND I HOPE THAT THAT THIS TIME IT DOES GO THROUGH YOU YOU SPOKE THROUGH GRITTED SPOKE ABOUT THE UNCONSCIONABLE T. IN THAT THAT STILL IS A TEST AT UNFORTUNATELY EVEN IN SOME OF THE OTHER CASES WHERE YOU HAVE MANDATORY CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION CLAUSES THE PEOPLE SIGN ON TO THEY THEY THEY AGREE TO THEM. BECAUSE THEY ARE IN NO POSITION NOT TO AGREE TO THEM THEY WANT THAT JOB THEY WANT THAT MEDICAL TREATMENT AND SO THE AGREE TO THE USE MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE THAT SIMPLY TAKE AWAY EVERY RIGHT THEY COULD POSSIBLY HAVE IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF THE IT IS A AS A RESULT OF THE MALFEASANCE OF THE PERSON. THAT IS THE BENEFICIARY OF THAT ARBITRATION CLAUSE BUT I DO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR THAT SCHWARTZ FAMILY I AM SO SORRY FOR WHAT THEY WENT THROUGH- FOR THEIR CHILD AND I HOPE THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THERE WILL BE CHANGES FOR THOSE CHILDREN AND THOSE PARENTS OF CHILDREN IN THE FUTURE THAT GO THROUGH THE SAME THING BUT ALSO FOR. THE OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY THESE MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSES THANK YOU AND I'D ALSO I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR IF YOU SO- FIND THAT WOULD BE OF COURSE THANK. YOU MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU SURE YOU SOME KILEY PERSON SINCE NUMBER THIS FOR- A- JUST ALL THE COMMENTS AND- PARTICULARLY THE- COMMENTS REGARDING THE POWER IMBALANCE THAT EXISTS- IN IN SIGNING OF THESE CONTRACTS AND SIGNING AWAY YOUR RIGHTS. IN ORDER TO HAVE A JOB IN ORDER TO HAVE YOUR CHILD GO TO SCHOOL. AND SO- THOSE COMMENTS REALLY RESONATE WITH ME- CERTAINLY IN MY SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY I DO BELIEVE THERE IS A SICK RELATIONSHIP IN TERMS OF YOUR SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL. OF ALL PLACES YOU KNOW THAT THAT I THINK THAT I THINK WE HAVE A VISCERAL. EMOTION WE HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING HAPPENING TO CHILDREN AT THEIR SCHOOL I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL THERE. IT'S IT IS ESPECIALLY- IT KINDA EMOTIONALLY. AIM FOR A I THINK THAT. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE ONE INDIVIDUAL VICTIM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT. BY NOT ALLOWING. THESE THESE INSIDIOUS SITUATIONS TO- REPETITIVE TO HAVE SUNLIGHT SHINED ON THEM. YOUR ALLOWING CONDUCT IN THESE INSTITUTIONS TO CONTINUE IN MANY CASES FOR MANY MANY YEARS WITH MANY MANY VICTIMS. AND SO THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TRY TO NOT ONLY BRING- SOME SENSE OF JUSTICE TO AN INDIVIDUAL TO DUMP IN MANY CASES COULD PREVENT. MANY MANY OTHER VICTIMS- WHEN YOU'RE NOT ALLOWING THAT SUN. TO SHINE IN SORT OF SPEAK. AND SO IN THAT REGARD I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT. IN THE IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT ALTHOUGH I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH MY- COLLEAGUES THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT. THE THIS FORCED MANDATORY ARBITRATION- IMPLICATES THEM WITH THE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND MANY OTHER WINDOWS- IN THIS CASE- THE HOPE IS THAT. WILL PREVENT CHILD VICTIMS- GOING FORWARD- IN INSTITUTIONS THAT BUT RATHER. EVERYTHING'S UNDER. INAPPROPRIATE THINGS UNDER THE RUG RATHER THAN ACTUALLY ALLOWING. FOR PUBLIC VENUES TO HAVE THEM. THE TICKET. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THIS GALLAGHER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND YEAH I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE- A LEFT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS ABOUT ARBITRATION YOU KNOW AND AS I THINK WHAT COMMONLY COMES UP AS YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE'S BEEF IS WITH THE FAA WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT- AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT FEDERAL LEGISLATOR LEGISLATORS WERE MORE STATE LEGISLATURES MAYBE WHEN MEMBERS NAY BECAUSE GO TO CONGRESS ONE DAY. THEY COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND CHANGE THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT BUT THAT IS WHAT REALLY GETS IN THE WAY OF BEING ABLE TO MAKE THE SUCH CHANGES IT IT DOES- YOU KNOW. WE'RE SORT OF SUPERSEDED BY THAT LAW- I THINK MR KILEY HAS. DONE A GOOD JOB OF SHOWING WHY IN THIS CASE THAT WOULD NOT APPLY- MOST NOTABLY BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH MINORS HERE. AND THAT MINORS CANNOT SIGN AWAY THEIR RIGHTS- THAT'S VERY CLEAR IN MANY DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE LAW- AND- YOUR LOOK ARBITRATION I THINK. YOU KNOW PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT DIFFERENT THINGS ABOUT IT BUT IT THERE ARE BENEFITS STARBIRD TRADITION. IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCIES IN TERMS OF ENSURING- QUICK ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACTUALLY BECAUSE OUR COURTS AS WE KNOW ARE NOT ALWAYS SO QUICK. AND LET'S NOT SAID THEY'RE ALWAYS SUNSHINY ESPECIALLY HERE RECENTLY WHEN THEY HAVE AN EMAIL ON THE PUBLIC- AND THE MANY COURT COURT ROOMS- WHEN JURY TRIALS HAVE BEEN DELAYED- AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T HAD. FOR INSTANCE QUICK JURY TRIALS- IN THE STATE LET'S NOT ACT LIKE OUR COURT SYSTEM IS SO OPEN AND TRANSPARENT BECAUSE IT. IT ACTUALLY HAS NOT BEEN IN MANY CASES- BUT YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE'RE GETTING THAT- IS THAT THE ISSUE THAT IT SEEMS UNFAIR- WHEN- ESPECIALLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT QUEER SCENE SOMEONE INTO AN AGREEMENT. OFTENTIMES ARE TALKING ABOUT ADULTS YOU BECOME AN EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD YOU'RE AN ADULT. YOU CAN MAKE ADULT DECISIONS YOU CAN DECIDE WHERE YOU WANT TO WORK YOU CAN DECIDE- SOME THESE DIFFERENT WHAT CONTRACTS YOU WANT TO ENTER INTO AND NOT ENTER INTO- THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONTEXT IN THE ONE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. RIGHT HERE- WE'RE WE HAVE MINORS WHO WHO HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO BY THE WAY- AND WE OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE GETTING AN EDUCATION- AND THEN HAVING THIS- BE IMPOSED UPON THEM AGAINST THEIR WILL. AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH A DIFFERENT BILL PEOPLE AND POWER PEOPLE THAT ARE GIVEN POWER AND STEWARDSHIP. I YOU KNOW- TO ALLOW THEM TO ABUSE THAT POWER AND THEN BASICALLY HIDE BEHIND SOMETHING IS NOT OK AND I THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY MIGHT BE THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT YOU KNOW OVERWHELMINGLY OBVIOUSLY OUR TEACHERS DO AN AMAZING JOB OF PROTECTING OUR KIDS OF TEACHING THEM- BUT THERE ARE SOME PRETTY EGREGIOUS EXAMPLES OF TEACHERS WHO HAVE ABUSED THEIR POWER- AND HAVE VIOLATED CHILDREN'S LOT RIGHTS AND- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HIDE BEHIND DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE SYSTEM. AND EVEN GOOD GET TRANSFERRED TO OTHER PLACES WHERE THEY CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME EXACT THING- WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED THAT IN OTHER AREAS OF OUR SOCIETY I THINK WE NEED TO START FOCUSING ON IT. IN THIS PART OF OUR SOCIETY AS WELL- SO I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE BILL APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS- AND- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING AFFORD. THE STATE. THANK YOU MISTER KELLY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS BILL I. YOU KNOW I THINK IF YOU REALLY WERE TO TAKE OUT OF YOU KNOW A POLL AND ASK PARENTS HOW MANY OF THEM. ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY DO IN A ROLE MEANT THAT THIS WOULD BE PART OF IT THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEIR CHILD THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO HAVE- VOICE THERE. THEY'D BE QUITE SHOCKED SO I APPRECIATE THIS- I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WOULD BE HONORED TO BE PART OF A CO AUTHOR. YES OF COURSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT THANK YOU AGAIN MR KILEY AND I THINK IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO PRO FEDERAL POLICIES THAT WE FIND THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE OR DETRIMENTAL TO OUR CITIZENRY. GET APPLIED YOUR- PERSISTENCE IN THIS AREA AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THAT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS CALDERON PLEASE STONE HI STONE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE CHAU. CHAU CHIU. DAVIES DAVEY SIDE AND SALAS GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY AYE KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN. RACE FIVE REASSIGN. RIGHT THANK YOU THAT BILLS OUT WE HAVE ONE MORE BILL AND THAT IS MY BILL AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN ITEM NUMBER SEVEN EIGHT. MR GALLAGHER DO. RUN THIS YES MISTER CHAIRMAN. OKAY. ALL RIGHT MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU ARE PRESENT TEAM. AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN YES THEY BECAUSE CRAZY EIGHTEEN. WHAT THIS BILL DOES MEMBERS IS IT TAKES AN ACTION. ABOUT A MINOR WHO IS CHANGING NAME OR GENDER WHICH IS GENERALLY REQUIRED TO BE DONE OUT IN CIVIL COURT WHEN THERE ARE. USUALLY THESE ARE ACTIONS THAT WERE WENT WHEN THAT CHILD IS INVOLVED IN THE JUVENILE COURT WHICH IS A MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR AN ACTION LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN SO THIS BILL DOES IS ALLOW. THEIR ATTORNEY TO BRING THIS ACTION IN JUVENILE COURT AND HAVE ALL OF THE BENEFITS AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT JUVENILE COURT REPRESENTS. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND THE OTHER ASPECT OF IT BECAUSE OF THE PRIVACY CONCERNS FOR JUVENILES IS IT DELETES THE REQUIREMENT THAT USUALLY WHEN THERE'S A NAME CHANGER A GENDER CHANGE THAT THAT HAPPENED A TO BE PUBLISHED IN A NEWSPAPER OF RECORD SINCE HE SAID THIS WOULD THEN BE A JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDING THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN. BUT ALL OF THE OTHER NOTIFICATIONS INCLUDING NOTIFICATIONS TO PARENTS WOULD STILL HAPPEN ALL THIS DOES IS WOULD PRECLUDE THE PUBLIC NOTICE BECAUSE IT'S A PART OF PROTECTING THAT CHILD THERE ARE I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MIKE BELOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND JUDGE ROBERT CHAN. REPRESENTING THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES OF CALIFORNIA BOTH. ARE AVAILABLE ON THE TELEPHONE AND- I ASK FOR YOUR RECIPE YOU'RE EITHER. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND WE DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES I BELIEVE IN AND SUPPORT ON THE PHONE MIKE BELOW FROM THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION AND ROGER CHAN. FROM THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES THE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT IS MIKE FOLLOWED UP FOR THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION I'LL BE BRIEF THE OTHER THING CAN SEEM COMPLICATED BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH BOTH GENDER AND NAME CHANGE PETITIONS. AND THEN THE JUVENILE COURT HAS TO AREAS THAT HAVE THE DEPENDENCY LAW AND THE DELINQUENCY CLOCK. I LIKE TO THINK OF THIS AS AFFECTING JURISDICTION CLARIFYING THAT THE JUVENILE COURT IS THE PROPER JURISDICTION FOR- BOTH A GENDER AND NAME CHANGE PETITIONS- FOR DELINQUENCY JUST AS IT IS NOW IN THE LAW OR DEPENDENCY- THIS MAKES SENSE FOR THE YOUTH AND IT ALSO MAKES SENSE FOR SOCIETY YOU WANT PEOPLE IN THE JUVENILE COURT HANDLING THESE MATTERS. SO YOU DON'T GET CONFUSION BETWEEN THE JUVENILE COURT AND THE CIVIL COURT. ASKED PUBLICATION- ALL THE BILL DOES IS SAY THAT FOR BOTH- FORD NAME CHANGE ONLY WE'VE ALREADY YOU HAVE ALREADY HANDLED THE GENDER CHANGE ISSUE. BUT ADDS TO THE NAME CHANGE ONLY. IT PRECLUDES PUBLICATION- FOR BOTH DEPENDENCY AND DELINQUENCY TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE MINOR AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT JUVENILE COURT PROCEEDINGS ARE PRESUMPTIVELY CLOSED. BECAUSE OF THE SENSITIVE NATURE OF THE- YOUTH INVOLVED SO IT WE THINK IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD IT CLARIFIES JURISDICTION AND REMOVES PUBLICATION ON NAME CHANGE PETITION- I. HAVE JUDGE ROGER CHAN ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IF THEY ARISE AND WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. OKAY OPERATOR YOU CAN YOU OPEN UP THE LINES FOR ANY- PERSONS WANTING TO EXPRESS SUPPORT. FOR A BI THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE TWO ZERO. IT WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH DEADLINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW. SOME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY- ANYWAY. I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION- BUT ARE THERE ANYBODY ON THE HONES WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN COULD PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR ONLINE NUMBER AND PLACE IT BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTEEN EIGHTEEN. PLUS PLUS ONE ZERO NOW. AT THE TIME OF THE CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY- BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE QUESTIONS OF THE AUTHOR. NOT JUST ONE QUESTION I HAD A MAYBE IT'S- FOR THE WITNESSES- RIGHT NOW LIKE IF YOU JUST IF A MINOR IS PRIVATELY GOING TO COURT TO DO A NAME CHANGE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE PUBLISHED RIGHT- SO WHY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO IS NOT CURRENTLY AWARDED EITHER DELINQUENCY YEAR. OR- DEPENDENCY. THEN THE NORMAL PERSON- YOU KNOW THE CHILD THAT'S NOT PART OF THE COURT MONEY TO CHANGE OUR CO WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUBLISH IT. BECAUSE IF. THEY'RE NOT THE WORD OF THE COURT IN THE CIRCUMSTANCE THEY'RE NOT TECHNICALLY ON THE JURISDICTION OF THE JUVENILE COURT SO THEY DON'T GET THOSE PROTECTIONS I DON'T DISAGREE THAT THAT WOULD BE. A GOOD CHANGE I THINK THE REQUIREMENT ESPECIALLY FOR JUVENILE TO HAVE TO PUBLISH PUBLICLY THAT THE NAME CHANGE. IS ARGUABLY PROBLEMATIC WOULD BE WE SHOULD BE WORKING TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND IN COULD BE PROTECTED WE'RE JUST DEALING WITH THE CASE WHERE THE CHILD IS IN. THE DELINQUENCY PROCESS AND IF THEY WANT TO DO A NAME CHANGE THEY HAVE TO GO. OUTSIDE OF THAT PROCESS TO CIVIL COURT TO. MAKE THAT PETITION. IF THIS BILL PASSES THAT WOULD ALL STATE WITHIN THE JUVENILE COURTS THAT'S THE FEES WERE TRYING TO SOLVE HERE.
