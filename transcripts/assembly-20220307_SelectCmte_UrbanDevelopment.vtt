LEGISLATURE IT'S REALLY.

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:09.841
INSPIRING AND GIVES US A LOT OF

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.342
HOPE ABOUT THE FUTURE. SO I'VE

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:13.144
BEEN ASKED TO COME TO FRAME

00:35:13.211 --> 00:35:14.912
THIS- BEGINNING OF THIS

00:35:14.979 --> 00:35:17.281
DISCUSSION- MY BACKGROUND IS IN

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:19.350
LAND USE I WROTE A BOOK ON THE

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:20.585
POLITICAL HISTORY OF LAND USE

00:35:20.651 --> 00:35:22.920
THE STATE OF WORKED ON VARIOUS.

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.322
ISSUES OF HABITAT CONSERVATION

00:35:24.388 --> 00:35:26.491
PLANNING OR JUST RECENTLY

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.759
PUBLISHED A PAPER ON NEW HALL

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:29.627
RANCH- AND I'M A NATIVE

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.262
CALIFORNIAN SO THESE ISSUES ARE

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.197
ARE NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART.

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:35.766
SO I GREATLY WELCOME. THE

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:37.235
OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SOME REMARKS

00:35:37.301 --> 00:35:38.669
ABOUT LAND USE AND LAND USE

00:35:38.736 --> 00:35:42.507
CHANGE. AND STATE TO FRAME THIS

00:35:42.573 --> 00:35:44.575
DISCUSSION. SO AS I WAS- WAS

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:46.777
SAID EARLIER LAND USE AND LAND

00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:48.312
DEVELOPMENT IT IS- THEY ARE A

00:35:48.379 --> 00:35:50.314
KEY COMPONENT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:35:50.381 --> 00:35:51.382
THEY AFFECT GREENHOUSE GAS

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:53.518
EMISSIONS EXPOSURE TO HEAT AND

00:35:53.584 --> 00:35:55.319
FIRE CARBON SEQUESTRATION

00:35:55.386 --> 00:35:56.721
ECOLOGICAL BIODIVERSITY

00:35:56.787 --> 00:36:00.725
AGRICULTURE. EXPOSURES TO HIGH

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:02.360
HEAT AND NEARLY EVERYTHING. I

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.061
ALSO THINK THAT MOST OF US WOULD

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:06.063
AGREE THAT REGARDLESS OF OUR

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:08.633
POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS LAND USE

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.601
IN THE STATE IS KIND OF BROKEN.

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.937
IT'S A REGULATORY LEGACY OF THE

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.472
NINETEENTH CENTURY AND WE'VE

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:16.040
MOVED IT TO THE TWENTIETH IN THE

00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:17.341
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BY HAD A

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.510
CHANCE MEASURES. ATTEMPTING TO

00:36:19.577 --> 00:36:21.646
MAINTAIN LOCAL CONTROL BUT CURB

00:36:21.712 --> 00:36:23.748
AGREE JUST PROJECTS ADDRESSED

00:36:23.814 --> 00:36:24.815
THE ISSUE GREENHOUSE GAS

00:36:24.882 --> 00:36:26.350
EMISSIONS AND THE PROVISION OF

00:36:26.417 --> 00:36:28.319
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. PROTECTING

00:36:28.386 --> 00:36:29.820
DANGEROUS SPECIES CREATING

00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:32.456
HORSES DATEABLE CITIES SO IT

00:36:32.523 --> 00:36:40.264
COUNTS SEQUOIA AB THIRTY TWO SB. THREE SEVENTY FIVE AS ONLY

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:40.898
SOME OF THOSE MEASURES. SO WE

00:36:40.965 --> 00:36:41.766
MUST. THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

00:36:41.832 --> 00:36:44.035
LAND JUST AS WE HAVE TODAY IS

00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:45.836
LARGELY THE RESULT OF OVER A

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.238
CENTURY OF PROCESS SEATS WERE IN

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:49.206
LOCALITIES OF LOCAL AND USES AS

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:51.242
THEIR MAIN DOMINANT FORMS OF

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:54.011
SOURCES OF REVENUE. HOTEL TAXES

00:36:54.078 --> 00:36:56.480
SALES TAXES AND SO ON OVERLAID

00:36:56.547 --> 00:36:58.516
BY MANY DECADES OF FORMAL AND

00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:01.185
INFORMAL SEGREGATION REDLINING

00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:04.088
RACISM AND WHITE FLIGHT WITH

00:37:04.155 --> 00:37:07.858
ZONING AS A WEAPON FOR

00:37:07.925 --> 00:37:08.859
DISCRIMINATION. THE SINGLE

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:10.394
FAMILIES ON WAS DEVELOPED AS A

00:37:10.461 --> 00:37:12.363
MECHANISM TO PROTECT WHITE

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.265
PEOPLE FROM PEOPLE OF COLOR. WE

00:37:14.332 --> 00:37:16.767
WERE RELEGATED TO SEPARATE HAD

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:19.303
MORE DENSE NEIGHBORHOODS. GROSS

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.272
SO MANY CALIFORNIA CITIES WAS A

00:37:21.339 --> 00:37:23.274
DIRECT RESULT OF WHITE FLIGHT

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:25.476
CREATING INDEPENDENT SUBURBS.

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.644
WITH THEIR OWN TAXPAYERS

00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:28.479
SWITCHING OUT WELL OFF OF THE

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:29.914
OLDER URBAN CORES FOR JOBSSTILL

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:31.682
REMAINED AND SUPPORTED BY

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:34.385
SUBSIDIZED ROAD AND HIGHWAY

00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:37.455
BUILDING. COMMUNITY COMMUTING

00:37:37.521 --> 00:37:38.789
ONE OUT AND THE DEVELOPMENT

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:40.925
COMMUNITY WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO

00:37:40.992 --> 00:37:44.428
JUMP ONTO THE BANDWAGON. GREEN-FIELDS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN

00:37:44.495 --> 00:37:46.097
EASIER TO DEVELOP AND THE

00:37:46.163 --> 00:37:48.032
STATE'S POST PROPOSITION

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.800
THIRTEEN DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT

00:37:49.867 --> 00:37:51.502
LAWS AMONG OTHER MEASURES. WHAT

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.237
MADE IT EVEN EASIER FOR LARGE

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:57.375
SCALE. SUBURBAN DEVELOPERS. THIS

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:59.977
IS OBVIOUS. OVERSIMPLIFICATION

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.846
BUT EVEN IN THE NINETEEN SIXTIES

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.681
ATTEMPTS TO CURB SPRAWL FOR

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:04.749
SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:07.652
FOR ATTEMPTED MOSTLY TO FAIL. IN

00:38:07.718 --> 00:38:09.020
THE END IN THE NINETEEN

00:38:09.086 --> 00:38:11.288
SEVENTIES WE GOT BOTH SYKORA

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:13.758
THAT WAS UP TO MAKE OBVIOUS

00:38:13.824 --> 00:38:14.892
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF

00:38:14.959 --> 00:38:16.227
DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY ON THE

00:38:16.293 --> 00:38:17.995
URBAN FRINGE AND PROPOSITION

00:38:18.062 --> 00:38:20.231
THIRTEEN. THESE ARE ONLY

00:38:20.297 --> 00:38:22.266
COMPOUNDED EXISTING DISTORTIONS

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:25.069
REWARDING STRIP MALL DEVELOPERS

00:38:25.136 --> 00:38:27.171
AS THOSE INCREASED SALES TAXES

00:38:27.238 --> 00:38:29.974
AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL AND

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.342
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY OWNERS-

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:33.177
THESE FURTHER UNDERMINED OF

00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:35.246
MULTIPLE UNIT HOUSING

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:36.814
NEIGHBORHOODS WITH MIXED USE OF

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.550
THE- TYPES OF HOUSING- VARIOUS

00:38:39.617 --> 00:38:40.751
TYPES OF HOUSING ON THE SAME

00:38:40.818 --> 00:38:42.453
STREET ACCESS TO PUBLIC

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.255
TRANSPORTATION PROVISION OF OPEN

00:38:44.321 --> 00:38:46.323
SPACE AND MUCH MUCH MORE. I

00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:48.192
WOULD ARGUE PRIVATIZING A GREAT

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:50.027
DEAL OF THE PUBLIC GROUND.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:51.762
LEAVES US DEVELOPED AND CONTINUE

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:54.432
TO CREATE LAND AND MATERIALS

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:56.300
EXPERT PICKS STUDENTS OF FORMS

00:38:56.367 --> 00:38:58.202
OF LAND DEVELOPMENT REQUIRING

00:38:58.269 --> 00:39:00.237
MILES OF NEW ASPHALT WHICH IS

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:02.139
ESSENTIALLY PETROLEUM. AND

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.642
PARKING LOTS CONCRETE RIBBONS OF

00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.677
ROADS AND SIDEWALKS POWER LINES

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:09.213
PIPELINES UNDERMINING ALL BEST

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.181
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE MORE

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:12.383
SUSTAINABLE CITIES. SO RATHER

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:13.784
THAN MAKING BETTER USE OF THE

00:39:13.851 --> 00:39:15.820
ALREADY DEVELOPED BUT OFTEN

00:39:15.886 --> 00:39:18.723
UNDER UTILIZED URBAN FABRIC WE

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:20.791
MOVED UPWARD. LEAVING THOSE

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.493
AREAS BEHIND UNLESS OUR TARGETS

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.528
FOR GENTRIFICATION WHICH SIMPLY

00:39:24.595 --> 00:39:26.731
EXACERBATES HOUSING QUALITIES IN

00:39:26.797 --> 00:39:28.299
THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR HALF A

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:30.034
CENTURY AND IT'S EXTREMELY

00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:32.269
DIFFICULT TO UNWIND. BUT IT

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:36.540
NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD. AND

00:39:36.607 --> 00:39:37.942
UNPACKED TO MOVE FORWARD. LOCAL

00:39:38.008 --> 00:39:39.543
GOVERNMENT ARE CAUGHT IN A BY.

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.544
THEY RELY ON LOCAL REVENUES FOR

00:39:40.611 --> 00:39:41.912
THEIR OPERATIONS AND LOCAL

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:43.948
REVENUES ARE GENERATED BY LAND

00:39:44.014 --> 00:39:46.016
USE SO THE TENT IS ON FOR

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.018
HIGHROAD STUFF MAKES SENSE BUT

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.220
IT UNDERMINES COMMUNITY

00:39:49.286 --> 00:39:50.755
UNDERMINES CLIMATE GOALS AND

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:53.090
UNDERMINES AFFORDABILITY AND

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:55.526
SUSTAINABILITY. USABLE FINANCES

00:39:55.593 --> 00:39:56.994
IT'S EVOLVED OVER THE DECADES

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.797
AND ESPECIALLY WITH PROPOSITION

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:00.431
THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY

00:40:00.498 --> 00:40:04.201
SIX. YES STRETCHED AND BRUTAL.

00:40:04.268 --> 00:40:05.736
SO CLIMATE CHANGE AS MORE

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.738
URGENCY TO ADDRESSING THE

00:40:07.805 --> 00:40:09.473
SLEDGES PATTERN BUT ONE SHOULD

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.442
NOT FORGET THAT THE POOR AND

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:12.843
PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE FAILED TO

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:15.646
SLOW VIOLENCE OF THIS SYSTEM FOR

00:40:15.713 --> 00:40:18.349
A LONG TIME. ONLY TO EXPERIENCE

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.784
THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.352
INDUCED HIGHER NUMBERS A FEW

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:24.622
DAYS AND HIGHER HEAT MORE

00:40:24.688 --> 00:40:26.524
SIGNIFICANTLY THAN OTHERS AS

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:28.526
WELL AS THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF

00:40:28.592 --> 00:40:30.995
INCREASED FINANCIAL IS ATION

00:40:31.061 --> 00:40:34.465
REALISTIC. ONE SECTOR IN MY

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.201
OPINION- BUT NOT JUST MY OPINION

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:39.203
I THINK IT'S AN INFORMED

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:40.938
OPINION- ABOUT SEEMS TO SKATE

00:40:41.005 --> 00:40:42.306
MUCH RESPONSIBILITY AS THE

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.575
PRIVATE SECTOR NOW CHARACTERIZED

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:47.311
BY EVEN LARGER SCALE BUILDERS

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:49.713
AND EQUITY CAPITAL. IT SECTOR IT

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:52.149
IS OUR TIME PLAN DETERMINING

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:54.285
DELAY OUT OF HOW WE LIVE OUR

00:40:54.351 --> 00:40:56.220
ABILITY TO INTERACT TO GET FROM

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.422
PLACE TO PLACE OUR ACCESS TO

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.424
OPEN SPACES AND SHOPPING OUR

00:41:00.491 --> 00:41:02.560
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

00:41:02.626 --> 00:41:04.261
ANCILLARY POLLUTION.

00:41:04.328 --> 00:41:05.863
SUSTAINABILITY HAS BECOME

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:09.133
TRANSLATED INTO CARBON OFFSETS

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.236
SO STEPPING BACK ONE MUST ASK

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:14.238
WHAT KIND OF VISION FOR HOW THE

00:41:14.305 --> 00:41:16.407
DESIGN AND BUILD THE PLACES WE

00:41:16.473 --> 00:41:18.509
ALL LIVE IN DOES THE INDUSTRY

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:21.245
HALF WHAT IS THE VISION LARGELY

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:23.214
DRIVEN BY FINANCIAL FORMULAS FOR

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.915
PROFIT WHICH ARE NOT SMALL IF

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.417
YOU START LOOKING UP THE PROFIT

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:27.618
MARGINS OF LARGE SCALE

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.553
DEVELOPERS IT'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.289
PERCENT. ANNUALLY AFTER ALL. HOW

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:34.491
CAN NEW YORK CITY EQUITY CAPITAL

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:35.993
REALLY CARE WHAT HAPPENS IN MY

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.995
NEIGHBORHOOD OTHER THAN

00:41:38.062 --> 00:41:38.996
UNDERSTANDING THE RETURN ON

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:40.965
INVESTMENT. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:42.299
THAT A FOR CONCERNED ABOUT

00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:45.302
PRODUCING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE.

00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:48.405
DECENT HOUSING PEOPLE CAN AFFORD

00:41:48.472 --> 00:41:49.740
AND DOESN'T HAVE TO OUR CLIMATE

00:41:49.807 --> 00:41:51.475
BURDEN THAT CREATE SUSTAINABLE

00:41:51.542 --> 00:41:54.111
COMMUNITIES WE ARE IN A CONTEXT

00:41:54.178 --> 00:41:55.613
WHERE LAND IS SO PRIVATELY AND

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:57.114
DEVELOPMENT IS LARGELY DONE BY

00:41:57.181 --> 00:41:58.983
PRIVATE COMPANIES. IT'S

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:01.151
DIFFICULT TO PRODUCE AFFORDABLE

00:42:01.218 --> 00:42:03.220
HOUSING ON THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:06.824
STRUCTURED AROUND EXCHANGE VALUE

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:10.160
OR PROFIT. THAT IS TO SAY PROFIT

00:42:10.227 --> 00:42:11.762
CLASSICALLY THE SITUATION HAS

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.497
BEEN REFERRED TO AS THE TENSION

00:42:13.564 --> 00:42:15.032
BETWEEN USE VALUE BEING IN A

00:42:15.099 --> 00:42:17.768
PLACE AS A HOME AND USING IT AS

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.803
YOUR HOME AND EXCHANGE VALUE.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:21.272
THE MARKET DRIVEN FORCES THAT

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.173
SHAPE OUR VIEW THAT LAND

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.276
OWNERSHIP IS A FINANCIAL ASSET.

00:42:25.342 --> 00:42:27.444
IF OWNERSHIP IS AN ASSET THAT WE

00:42:27.511 --> 00:42:29.346
WANT PRICES TO GO UP TO MAKE A

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:31.682
PROFIT. BUT IF OWNERSHIP OR

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:32.683
ACCESS TO HOUSING IS A HUMAN

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:36.620
NEED THEN THE MARKET MOTIVATIONS

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:39.356
FOR PROFIT ARE INCOMPATIBLE. SO

00:42:39.423 --> 00:42:41.959
WHAT WHAT IS TO BE DONE. WE NEED

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:44.261
MANY MORE PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:46.397
PARTNERSHIPS IN LAND DEVELOPMENT

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:47.998
FOR THE STATE TO THAT IS

00:42:48.065 --> 00:42:48.999
GOVERNMENT WHETHER IT'S LOCAL

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:50.501
GOVERNMENT REGIONAL GOVERNMENT

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:52.836
STATE GOVERNMENT. CAN GUIDE THE

00:42:52.903 --> 00:42:54.038
TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND RATES

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:57.241
OF RETURN FOR PRIVATE DEVELOPERS

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:59.677
THAT DRIVE DOWN COSTS AND WE

00:42:59.743 --> 00:43:01.645
HAVE A MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:03.380
SITUATION WITH A PRIVATE

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.582
MONOPOLY UTILITIES THEY PROVIDE

00:43:05.649 --> 00:43:07.618
A PUBLIC SERVICE WE ENABLE THE

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:09.186
SHAREHOLDERS TO MAKE A PROFIT

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:12.356
BUT ONLY HONEST CERTAIN LEVEL.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:14.325
THE STATE THAT IS AGAIN

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.361
GOVERNMENT. WHATEVER SCALE USED

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:18.862
TO PURCHASE LAND USING EMINENT

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:20.898
DOMAIN TO PROVIDE HOUSING AFTER

00:43:20.965 --> 00:43:23.267
ALL IF WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:25.803
TO PURCHASE LAND FOR FREEWAYS BY

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:28.005
EMINENT DOMAIN WE OUGHT TO BE

00:43:28.072 --> 00:43:29.974
ABLE TO PURCHASE LAND FOR

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.008
HOUSING BY EMINENT DOMAIN I KNOW

00:43:31.075 --> 00:43:33.544
IT'S A VERY BIG ASK BUT I ALSO

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.980
THINK IT. IS BECOMING

00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:37.848
INCREASINGLY CRITICAL. WE NEED

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.517
TO ELIMINATE THE SINGLE FAMILY

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.820
ZONES BUT DOESN'T NEED A LIMON

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.188
HANGS SINGLE FAMILY DWELLINGS BY

00:43:44.254 --> 00:43:47.291
ANY MEANS IT JUST MEANS THE ZONE

00:43:47.358 --> 00:43:49.860
ITSELF. IS A- NEEDS TO BE

00:43:49.927 --> 00:43:52.162
RETHOUGHT COMPLETELY AND ALLOW

00:43:52.229 --> 00:43:54.832
GENTLE DENSITY TO GRADUALLY

00:43:54.898 --> 00:43:56.266
CHANGE OVER THE STERILE SINGLE

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:58.202
FAMILY ZONE INCLUDING AND

00:43:58.268 --> 00:44:00.571
INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO BUILD

00:44:00.637 --> 00:44:01.939
NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL. WITH A

00:44:02.006 --> 00:44:03.607
VERY GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS WAS

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:05.409
THE RECENTLY PASSED MINNEAPOLIS

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.544
PLAN WERE IN MINNEAPOLIS THEY

00:44:07.611 --> 00:44:08.612
LOOKED AT THEIR ZONING AND

00:44:08.679 --> 00:44:10.314
REALIZED IT WAS A LEGACY OF

00:44:10.381 --> 00:44:12.950
HISTORICAL RACISM AND THAT THE

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:14.818
SINGLE FAMILY ZONE. ENDED UP

00:44:14.885 --> 00:44:16.520
REINFORCING PRIVILEGE TO A

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:19.256
DEGREE THAT WAS EXTRAORDINARY SO

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:21.525
THEY HAVE A THEY HAVE UNLIMITED

00:44:21.592 --> 00:44:22.526
OF THE SINGLE FAMILIES ARE YOU

00:44:22.593 --> 00:44:23.660
CAN STILL HAVE SINGLE FAMILY

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:25.629
HOMES THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BUT

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.097
YOU'RE ALSO ALLOWED. THIS GENTLE

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.966
DENSITY I'M THROUGHOUT THE CITY

00:44:29.033 --> 00:44:31.335
THAT I THINK- REALLY BEGINS TO

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.737
CHANGE THE EQUATION ABOUT HOW WE

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:36.340
THINK OF WHERE WE LIVE AND WE

00:44:36.407 --> 00:44:38.008
COULD HAVE. YOUR KID TO WALK TO

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:38.742
THE NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:42.279
YOU CAN GET YOUR HAIR CUT OR AND

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.280
YOU HAVE MUCH BETTER ACCESS TO

00:44:43.347 --> 00:44:45.049
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WITH THIS

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:46.717
KIND OF DENSITY. I ALSO THINK

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.052
THAT- THE STATE COULD BE TO

00:44:48.118 --> 00:44:49.787
PROVIDE LOW TO NO INTEREST LOANS

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:50.954
TO SINGLE FAMILY HOMEOWNERS TO

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.956
BUILD EIGHTY USE DUPLEXES AND

00:44:53.023 --> 00:44:54.758
MORE WE NEED TO FLEXIBLE.

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.594
FINANCE SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WISH

00:44:57.661 --> 00:45:00.330
TO HAVE VERY MODEST INCOMES CAN

00:45:00.397 --> 00:45:03.000
STILL. REDEVELOP THEIR LANDED

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.768
INCLUDE THE EIGHTY USE A GRANNY

00:45:04.835 --> 00:45:06.637
FLAT THE DUPLEX AND THE REST BUT

00:45:06.703 --> 00:45:08.472
ACCESS TO FINANCING IS VERY

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:09.706
DIFFICULT. AND WE NEED TO

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:12.943
RETHINK- FINANCING IN THAT REALM

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:18.715
. AT THE SAME TIME OF THE STATE

00:45:18.782 --> 00:45:19.283
IN FURTHER TRAINING IN THE

00:45:19.349 --> 00:45:21.652
BUILDING TRADES. TO GROW THAT

00:45:21.718 --> 00:45:23.487
SECTORS SO THEY'RE AVAILABLE FOR

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.622
MANY SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT WE

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:27.424
RECENTLY BUILT IN EIGHTY YOU IN

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:28.659
THE BACK OF OUR DAUGHTERS OF

00:45:28.725 --> 00:45:31.195
PROPERTY BUT TO FIND A BUILDER.

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:32.729
WHO IS WILLING TO TAKE ON SUCH A

00:45:32.796 --> 00:45:34.264
SMALL PROJECT WAS VERY VERY

00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:36.066
DIFFICULT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:36.700
LOOKING FOR MUCH BIGGER

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.936
PROJECTS. AND THAT IS IN PART

00:45:39.002 --> 00:45:40.571
BECAUSE THERE'S INSUFFICIENT

00:45:40.637 --> 00:45:44.041
CAPACITY IN THE BUILDING TRADES

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.776
TO DO MANY MANY DIFFERENT

00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.644
PROJECTS AT ONCE SO WE NEED TO

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:49.947
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN UPSKILLING

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:53.283
PEOPLE INTO THAT. INTO THAT

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.019
SECTOR. WE AND THIS IS NOT A NEW

00:45:56.086 --> 00:45:58.288
IDEA EITHER WE NEED TO ENFORCE

00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:00.891
PERMANENT ONES. AHEAD TRANSFER

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.360
OF DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS. IF YOU

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.495
DRIVE AROUND MOST OF OUR

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:06.997
METROPOLITAN AREAS YES WE HAVE

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:08.632
DEAD SPRAWL BUT IT'S NOT THAT

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:10.400
THERE'S STILL A LOT OF LAND TO

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:12.603
BE DEVELOPED. IN THE EXISTING

00:46:12.669 --> 00:46:14.471
URBAN FABRIC AS I WAS TALKING

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:16.740
ABOUT EARLIER. BUT WE ABSOLUTELY

00:46:16.807 --> 00:46:17.841
NEED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT'S

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:19.576
ALREADY BEEN BUILT AND ADVERTISE

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:21.778
THAT INVESTMENT AND THAT CREATES

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.280
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE PEOPLE CAN

00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:25.516
ENCOUNTER EACH OTHER. WE CAN

00:46:25.582 --> 00:46:27.851
HAVE SOCIAL LIVES A WEEKEND

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.520
ACCESS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WE

00:46:29.586 --> 00:46:31.622
CAN BUILD ACCESSIBLE AND SMALL

00:46:31.688 --> 00:46:33.323
SCALE OPEN SPACES THAT ARE

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.792
DOTTED ALL AROUND. WE NEED TO

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:36.860
HAVE THE GOAL OF CREATING

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:39.363
GENEROUS AND HOSPITABLE CITIES

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:43.567
AND. DENSITY IS CERTAINLY A PART

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:45.669
OF THAT- AND WE CAN ONLY DO SO

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.037
BY LIMITING DEVELOPMENT WHERE IT

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:49.640
REALLY SHOULD BE GOING. NOT FAR

00:46:49.706 --> 00:46:52.176
HIGHER FIRE RISK AND NOT MUCH

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:54.645
MORE THAN THAT. I ALSO THINK-

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.513
WE'VE NEGLECTED TO REQUIRE

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:58.182
DEVELOPERS TO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.983
HOUSING AT THE PROPORTIONS THAT

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:02.252
REFLECT THE NEED NOT JUST YOU

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:05.022
KNOW A SMALL SET ASIDE LIKE FOUR

00:47:05.088 --> 00:47:06.790
UNITS IN TWO HUNDRED THAT ARE

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:08.091
AFFORDABLE BUT ACTUALLY IT

00:47:08.158 --> 00:47:09.193
SHOULD PROBABLY BE THE REVERSE

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:11.328
GIVEN THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE

00:47:11.395 --> 00:47:14.865
HOUSING DOCTOR I MEAN. TO- MAYBE

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:17.534
QUICKLY FINISH HERE THANKS MORE

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:22.439
POINTS YES. ALMOST THAT IN FACT

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:23.607
I ONLY HAVE ONE MORE POINT- AND

00:47:23.674 --> 00:47:26.243
IS A WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO PUSH

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.611
FOR SPLIT ROLL APPROACH TO

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:28.712
PROPOSITION THIRTEEN- AND THAT

00:47:28.779 --> 00:47:30.480
WILL HELP FUND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:31.582
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY SO

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:34.251
HEAVILY ON YOUR ON THE SALES

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:35.719
TAX. SO I THINK THESE ARE THESE

00:47:35.786 --> 00:47:37.955
ARE NOT. UNEXPECTED KINDS OF

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:39.590
PROPOSALS BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE A

00:47:39.656 --> 00:47:41.925
LOT OF POLITICAL WILL AND I KNOW

00:47:41.992 --> 00:47:43.660
HOW DIFFICULT IT IS I KNOW YOU

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:44.828
ALL OF THE TRYING VERY VERY

00:47:44.895 --> 00:47:47.698
HARD. BUT THOSE ARE MY

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:49.666
REFLECTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU

00:47:49.733 --> 00:47:50.767
SO MUCH NOW IT'S MY

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:51.435
UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE GOING TO BE

00:47:51.501 --> 00:47:53.437
STICKING AROUND FOR THE NEXT

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.538
PANEL SO I'M GONNA ASK THAT WE

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:56.440
HOLD ANY QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER

00:47:56.506 --> 00:47:57.641
THE NEXT PANEL. AND WITHOUT WILL

00:47:57.708 --> 00:48:00.010
BRING IN- THE NEXT PANEL WHICH

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:01.578
IS THE ROLE OF STATE GOVERNMENT

00:48:01.645 --> 00:48:03.447
AND BUILDING SUSTAINABLE

00:48:03.513 --> 00:48:04.381
COMMUNITIES- WE ARE GOING TO

00:48:04.448 --> 00:48:06.783
HAVE ON THIS PANEL. I'M SURE NOT

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.552
AS MS ROD THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:42.030
TARGETED PROGRAMS I THINK THAT

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.398
PART OF THE PROBLEM IS HOUSING

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.866
THAT IS SO EXPENSIVE ON THE

01:21:44.933 --> 01:21:47.369
HIGH. AND THE EXCLUSIONARY

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.504
NATURE OF THAT HIGH END HOUSING

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:52.540
BECAUSE OF THESE WILL NOT

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:01.970
NOT ALWAYS THE MOST CONDUCIVE

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:03.304
SUCH FOR THEIR TIGHT TIMELINES

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:04.906

THEY FEEL THE TIMELINE THAT

01:24:09.944 --> 01:24:12.814
THINGS DON'T MATCH UP WITH THEIR

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.583
DELIVERY TIMELINE. WELL SURE THE

01:24:15.650 --> 01:24:17.519
TIMELINE IS TYPICALLY ONE OF OUR

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.220
OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND THE

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:21.790
APPLICANTS BIGGEST CHALLENGE. WE

INCENTIVIZE READINESS AND MOST

01:24:23.925 --> 01:24:24.926
OF OUR FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:27.629

YESTERDAY AS WE MAKE THE AWARD-

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:36.371

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.745
CAN IF THEY CAN START TO GET

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.180
INTO YEARS ARE PRETTY GOOD

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:46.915
SHAPE. RIGHT AFTER THAT THIS IS

01:24:46.981 --> 01:24:48.783
THIS MAKING HER TO BE ON THAT ON

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.752
THE POLICY SIDE IS. JUST A

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.454
REMINDER THAT WE ALSO HAVE A

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:54.456
ROLE IN HOW THE PRIVATE MARKET-

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:56.424

UP- HOUSING ACROSS THE SEAT

01:25:03.998 --> 01:25:05.567
HOUSING PRODUCTION THAT ISN'T

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:07.902
NECESSARILY GOING THROUGH- ONE

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:08.903
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:12.106
PROGRAMS. SO IF WE CAN INTERVENE

01:25:12.173 --> 01:25:13.408
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

01:25:13.475 --> 01:25:15.977
INCREASED DENSITY CAPACITY NEAR

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:18.012
JOBS TRANSIT AND RESOURCES IF WE

01:25:18.079 --> 01:25:19.547
CAN WORK WITH CITIES TO MAKE

01:25:19.614 --> 01:25:20.949
SURE THAT THOSE APPROVAL PROCESS

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.317
THESE. ARE HAPPENING BY RIGHT

01:25:22.383 --> 01:25:23.651
AND AREN'T EXPEDITED TIMELINE

01:25:23.718 --> 01:25:25.119
THAT IS GOING TO SAVE HUNDREDS

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:27.055
OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER UNIT

01:25:27.121 --> 01:25:28.523

WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:25:31.526 --> 01:25:32.927
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING SO THAT'S AND

01:25:32.994 --> 01:25:34.662
THAT'S ANOTHER ROLE WE PLAY

01:25:34.729 --> 01:25:36.664
OUTSIDE OF THE DIRECT FUNDING

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:37.932
AND THAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:38.533
INCREASE AFFORDABILITY

01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:40.435

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND I'M

01:25:59.888 --> 01:26:01.789

NEEDS WENT DOWN SUBSTANTIALLY SO

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:02.523
YOU KNOW PLACES LIKE ALPINE

01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:04.859
COUNTY. I GOT THE MINIMUM

01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.928
HOUSING GOAL THEY CAN GET WHICH

01:31:06.994 --> 01:31:08.563
IS TO FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY OVER

01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:09.764
THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS. SO WE ARE

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.399
TALKING ABOUT INCREASING GROWTH

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:12.733
EVERYWHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:13.835
INCREASING BREATH WHERE IT'S

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:17.572
NEEDED- BUT- ALL STATE. HOUSING

01:31:17.638 --> 01:31:20.007
I HOUSING IS NEEDED EVERYWHERE

01:31:20.074 --> 01:31:23.678
IT'S ABOUT- CREATING A SITUATION

01:31:23.744 --> 01:31:25.847
WHERE IT ISN'T ACTUALLY HARDER

01:31:25.913 --> 01:31:28.015
TO BUILD AND SELL. AND THEN TO

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.317
BUILD OTHER TYPES OF HOUSING AND

01:31:29.383 --> 01:31:30.918
I WOULD SAY THAT COMMUNITY

01:31:30.985 --> 01:31:31.853
OPPOSITION REALLY PREVENTS THAT

01:31:31.919 --> 01:31:33.187
FROM BEING TRUE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.455
BACK ON THE HOUSING DISCUSSION

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:35.623
BUT GOING BACK AGAIN TO THE

01:31:35.690 --> 01:31:36.390
SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

01:31:36.457 --> 01:31:37.992
DISCUSSION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.527
CREATING HOUSING RIGHT IT'S ALSO

01:31:39.594 --> 01:31:41.462
ABOUT CREATING. WAYS OF REDUCING

01:31:41.529 --> 01:31:43.664
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IN AREAS

01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:45.166
MAYBE THAT ARE EVEN MORE BUILT

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.934
OUT. BUT IF ALSO THAT

01:31:47.001 --> 01:31:50.271
RECOGNITION IS THAT BECAUSE OF

01:31:50.338 --> 01:31:51.873
AN EQUITABLE DEVELOPMENT

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:52.974
PATTERNS YOU HAVE SOME AREAS

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:56.110
SOME OF OUR- LESS ARE MORE AT

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.945
CHALLENGED AREAS OR TYPICALLY

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.680
UNDERINVESTED AREAS. THAT HAVE

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:01.949
BORNE THE BRUNT OF MORE DENSITY

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:02.817
AND MORE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.518
YEARS. THEY ALSO TEND TO BE THE

01:32:04.585 --> 01:32:06.454
AREA SET UP THE TRANSIT IN THE

01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.556
JOBS OFTEN. SO IT SEEMS LIKE WE

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:09.957
STILL CAN OUR CONTINUING IT'S

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.392
NOT A BAD THING BUT WE'RE

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:12.593
CONTINUING TO TRY TO OPEN UP

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:13.728
MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE

01:32:13.794 --> 01:32:15.796
AREAS FOR EVEN MORE HOUSING. BUT

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:18.199
IN SOME WAYS THE AREAS THAT FOR

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:19.400
A LOT OF THOSE REASONS THAT WAS

01:32:19.467 --> 01:32:21.235
CITED BY THE PROFESSOR AND THE

01:32:21.302 --> 01:32:23.337
FIRST PANEL. DIDN'T DO THAT KIND

01:32:23.404 --> 01:32:24.705
OF DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:25.673
WANTED TO BE THE EXCLUSIVE

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.308
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS.%

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.610
YEAH WE ARE NOT ASKING THEM TO

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.745
BECOME MORE SUSTAINABLE FOR

01:32:30.811 --> 01:32:35.049
INSTANCE BY ALLOWING MORE.

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:36.050
COMMERCIAL USES IN THOSE

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:36.684
NEIGHBORHOODS ONES THAT WERE DO

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:37.718
SO VEHICLE MILES. YOU KNOW THE

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:39.587
GROCER THE LITTLE BODEGAS. DAY

01:32:39.654 --> 01:32:41.622
CARE CENTERS ALL OF THOSE USES

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.024
THAT WOULD. KEEP PEOPLE FROM

01:32:43.090 --> 01:32:45.159
HAVING TO THEN TRAVEL INTO THOSE

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:47.762
DENSER AREAS RIGHT. SO DOES IT

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:50.064
DO YOU LOOK AT WAYS OF TRYING

01:32:50.131 --> 01:32:52.500
TO. CHANGE THE WAY THAT THOSE

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.001
COMMUNITIES ARE PLANNING TO

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.837
ALLOW THAT ARE YOU ACTIVELY

01:32:56.904 --> 01:32:58.439
INVOLVED YEAH THAT SPACE TO. YES

01:32:58.506 --> 01:32:59.607
AND I DID MISUNDERSTAND THE

01:32:59.674 --> 01:33:01.042
QUESTION FIRST SO I APOLOGIZE

01:33:01.108 --> 01:33:03.177
BUT YES THAT IS THE OTHER COURT

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:04.679
SIDE OF OUR COIN AND THAT IS

01:33:04.745 --> 01:33:05.880
SOMETHING DIFFERENT AS PART OF

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:07.415
OUR HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS THIS

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:08.683
TIME SO ALL OF THOSE

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:09.884
JURISDICTIONS YOU'RE SPEAKING UP

01:33:09.951 --> 01:33:11.585
WOULD NEED TO TALK TO US ABOUT

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.421
THEIR PLACE BASED STRATEGIES-

01:33:13.487 --> 01:33:15.423
THAT THEY- THAT THEY ARE DOING

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:16.657
IN THOSE TYPES OF COMMUNITIES TO

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:18.726
INCREASE THAT- INCREASE THE

01:33:18.793 --> 01:33:20.294
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INCREASE

01:33:20.361 --> 01:33:22.730
THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT- AN

01:33:22.797 --> 01:33:23.764
ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THOSE GOALS

01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.666
YOU'RE SPEAKING TOO SO IT'S NOT.

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:27.101
ALWAYS GOING TO BE HOUSING

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:28.669
SOLUTIONS IT'S ALSO GOING TO BE

01:33:28.736 --> 01:33:30.604
A MATCH A MATCH COMMUNITY AND

01:33:30.671 --> 01:33:32.239
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

01:33:32.306 --> 01:33:33.407
THAT'S APPROPRIATE TO THE PLACE

01:33:33.474 --> 01:33:35.309
WERE WERE EVALUATING I'D LIKE TO

01:33:35.376 --> 01:33:36.644
AYE THAT'S GREAT I'M GLAD TO

01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:38.579
HEAR IT AND I'D LOVE TO SEE HOW

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.047
YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING

01:33:40.114 --> 01:33:41.415
THAT. AND HOW YOU'RE MEASURING

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:43.884
THAT AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:33:43.951 --> 01:33:44.618
COMMUNITIES- THE COME IN EITHER

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:46.020
WITH THEIR UPDATED HOUSING

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:47.722
ELEMENT OR THEY DON'T AND JUST

01:33:47.788 --> 01:33:48.756
HOW YOU DO THAT BECAUSE I

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.725
REPRESENT A LOT OF BEDROOM

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:51.359
COMMUNITIES AND I HAVEN'T SEEN

01:33:51.425 --> 01:33:52.660
ANY MOVEMENT AT ALL TOWARDS ANY

01:33:52.727 --> 01:33:54.695
OF THAT LIKE NONE. SO I'M

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.364
CURIOUS AS TO HOW YOUR YOU KNOW

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.966
I HAVE TO TELL ME NOW BUT KIND

01:33:59.033 --> 01:34:00.267
OF WHAT YOUR PARENTS ARE FOR

01:34:00.334 --> 01:34:02.269
TRYING TO- CHANGE THAT. I HAVE A

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.404
QUESTION ABOUT THE CONNECTING

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.772
COMMUNITIES IN THE HIGHWAYS TO

01:34:04.839 --> 01:34:07.108
BOULEVARDS PROGRAMS AND IT GOES

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.210
A LITTLE BIT BACK TO THAT EQUITY

01:34:09.276 --> 01:34:10.911
PIECE ABOUT HOW YOU REACH OUT-

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:13.481

TRADITIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:18.619
COMMUNITIES LOWER INCOME

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.421
COMMUNITIES AND LET THEM KNOW

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.156
ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES TO APPLY FOR

01:34:22.223 --> 01:34:22.890
THESE GRANTS AND WHETHER YOU

01:34:22.957 --> 01:34:25.259
HELP THEM- MAKE THOSE

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:26.961
APPLICATIONS SO THAT THEY CAN.

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:32.133
HOPEFULLY BRING HOME. SOME OF

01:34:32.199 --> 01:34:33.167
THAT FUNDING TO THEIR

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:34.468

OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FRONT

01:34:41.442 --> 01:34:42.443
HOWEVER YOU KNOW I THINK

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:43.711
THERE'S- THERE'S A LOT OF

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:44.412
GROUNDWORK AND PRESIDENT PARTY

01:34:44.478 --> 01:34:46.847
SAID THAT WE CAN BUILD OFF OF

01:34:46.914 --> 01:34:47.548
PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT THE

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.250
WORK. BUT AS CHEESY AS BEEN ABLE

01:34:49.316 --> 01:34:50.851
TO DO ON THE TRANSPORT OF CLAMOR

01:34:50.918 --> 01:34:52.653

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:09.537
IT HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT NAME

01:35:09.603 --> 01:35:10.604
I THINK IT WILL REQUIRE THE SAME

01:35:10.671 --> 01:35:13.040
TYPE OF. ART YOUR POINT KIND OF

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:14.041

COMMITTED TO IN THE PLAN CAME

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:22.409

01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:23.711
OUT AN ANNUAL REPORTS WHICH IS

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:27.848
DUE OUT THIS FALL- ON OUR-

01:36:27.915 --> 01:36:30.050
IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AND HOW

FOR. INVESTMENT SUITE- THAT WAS

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:01.015
INCLUDED UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:03.150
CAP DIED A YEAR OVER YEAR TO SEE

01:37:03.217 --> 01:37:04.718
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND SO

AND- I AM VERY GLAD THAT SOMEONE

01:37:17.464 --> 01:37:21.135
BROUGHT UP- CAL GREEN- WHICH IS

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.036
VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY

01:37:22.102 --> 01:37:23.837
IMPACTFUL- AND OF COURSE

01:37:23.904 --> 01:37:25.573
ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES IS A

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:26.907
HUGE PART OF OUR CLIMATE

01:37:26.974 --> 01:37:28.542
STRATEGY. AND AT THE SAME TIME

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:29.777
WE CAN'T FORGET THAT REDUCING

01:37:29.843 --> 01:37:31.378
VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS ALSO

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:33.647
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WAS

01:37:33.714 --> 01:37:35.583
MENTIONED- THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:37.051
THAT SUPPORTS SINGLE PASSENGER

01:37:37.117 --> 01:37:38.419
VEHICLES IS NOT ONLY NOT

01:37:38.485 --> 01:37:40.521
SUSTAINABLE AND LEAD TO A LOT OF

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:42.156
BAD PUBLIC HEALTH OUTCOMES IN A

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:44.124
LOT OF TIME SPENT IN TRAFFIC.

01:37:44.191 --> 01:37:45.693
IT'S ALSO THE REASON IS WAS ALSO

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.760
POINTED OUT THAT EVERYBODY

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:47.995
DOESN'T WANT DEVELOPMENT IN

01:37:48.062 --> 01:37:49.129
THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:52.299
TRAFFIC IN THE CARS SO YOU KNOW

01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:55.102
IN SOME WAYS ALL OF THE GREEN

01:37:55.169 --> 01:37:57.137
CAR INFRASTRUCTURE WERE DOING.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:37:59.006
IS A LITTLE BIT AT ODDS WITH

01:37:59.073 --> 01:37:59.573
THEIR GOALS TO BUILD MORE

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:01.375
HOUSING AND TO HAVE MORE LIVABLE

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:02.676
COMMUNITIES IN A FIFTEEN MINUTE

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:05.713
CITIES SO I'M ALSO WONDERING HOW

01:38:05.779 --> 01:38:07.581
WE EVALUATE THOSE INVESTMENTS

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:11.185
AGAINST OUR GOALS OF. SHIFTING

01:38:11.252 --> 01:38:12.853
PEOPLE OVER TO MORE SUSTAINABLE

01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.488
MODES OF TRANSPORTATION AND MORE

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:16.890
MORE SUSTAINABLE CITIES SO I

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:19.493
DON'T REMEMBER IF IT WAS YOU OR

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:20.794
MISTER SHIELDS WHO TALKED ABOUT

01:38:20.861 --> 01:38:24.265
THOSE- ELECTRIC VEHICLE-

01:38:24.331 --> 01:38:25.866
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS WHAT

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:27.368
I'M WONDERING I GUESS FOR BOTH

01:38:27.434 --> 01:38:29.370
OF YOU HOW YOU'RE GOING TO

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:31.205
BALANCE. THAT GOAL WITH THE GOAL

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:34.942
OF NOT HAVING PEOPLE ON SO MANY

01:38:35.009 --> 01:38:40.881
CARS. GREG ABBOTT THAT MAY HAVE

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:42.049
BEEN YOU KNOW BROUGHT BROUGHT

01:38:42.116 --> 01:38:44.652
THE- YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO. WELL

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.053
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU'RE THE ONE

01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.022
WHO'S MORE GERMANE TO

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.857
TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS. SURE

01:38:49.923 --> 01:38:51.358
HAPPENED A NUMBER IN AND THEN-

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:53.994
IF CREDIT RATING ADEQUATE- ON ON

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:57.998
OUR END I THINK- YOU KNOW IT. IT

01:38:58.065 --> 01:38:59.633
IT. WE DN'T NECESSARILY SEE IT

01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:02.870
AS AS AS A COMPETING INTERESTS

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:05.539
IT'S BECAUSE- BOTH CAN BE

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.374
PURSUED ONLY AND APPARENTLY

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:09.109
WITHOUT HAVING. NEGATIVE

01:39:09.176 --> 01:39:11.745
IMPACTS- ON ON EACH OTHER YOU

01:39:11.812 --> 01:39:13.914
KNOW I THINK- THE REALITIES WILL

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:15.549
CONTINUE TO HAVE VEHICLES ON THE

01:39:15.616 --> 01:39:18.686
ROAD FOR DECADES TO COME SO THE

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:20.421
PUSH TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.822
AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE WILL

01:39:21.889 --> 01:39:22.923
CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT HOWEVER

01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:25.025
YOU KNOW WE- AT CALS AND

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:27.027
STRESSED THAT IT THAT IT- THEY

01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:28.729
NEED FOR SHIFTING OF MODES IN. A

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:30.431
MONTH SO WE TRAVEL AND REDUCING

01:39:30.497 --> 01:39:31.765
OUR DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING NEEDS

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.600
TO BE NEEDS TO BE A CENTRAL PART

01:39:33.667 --> 01:39:37.705
OF THE CONVERSATION- S. MEMBER

01:39:37.771 --> 01:39:39.940
STATION WHAT DO YOU HOW DO THAT

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:40.941
TRANSLATE THAT INTO ACTUAL

01:39:41.008 --> 01:39:41.709
INVESTMENTS. HOW DO YOU

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.577
WONDERING HOW YOU BALANCE ALL OF

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:46.013
THAT. YEAH I THINK I THINK WHAT

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.416
MAKES ITS- FRANKLY LITTLE EASIER

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.719
ON OUR END IS THAT THE DOLLARS

01:39:51.785 --> 01:39:56.423
MINUTES VETS- GO TOWARDS. THEY

01:39:56.490 --> 01:39:57.558
WERE SERVING ONE PERSON I'M

01:39:57.624 --> 01:39:59.526
SURE- ADDS A KIND OF A

01:39:59.593 --> 01:40:00.627
TRADITIONAL TRNSPORTATION

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.596
INFRASTRUCTURE TEND TO COME FROM

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:03.697
DIFFEENT SOURCES SO YOU KNOW WE

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:05.499
DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A DIRECT

01:40:05.566 --> 01:40:08.268
KIND OF DATED A COMPETING- AT

01:40:08.335 --> 01:40:10.371
INTEREST IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF

01:40:10.437 --> 01:40:11.839
A DECIDING UPON WHAT TYPE OF

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:16.076
PROJECT OR OVER ANOTHER GROUP

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:17.111
FROM A KIND OF A- ACTED WILL.

01:40:17.177 --> 01:40:19.613
HOW YOU KNOW IT- IN THINGS LIKE

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.816
- ARE FOR EXAMPLE- WHERE WE KNOW

01:40:22.883 --> 01:40:24.818
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:28.088
REDUCE- VEHICLE TRAVEL AND THAT

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:30.691
DOESN'T NECESSARILY ISN'T- EIGHT

01:40:30.758 --> 01:40:32.760
GOAL THAT THAT WE NEED TO. TO

01:40:32.826 --> 01:40:34.528
HAVE GIVEN THE IMPORTS OF RATES-

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:36.263
MOVEMENT OF THE STATE BECOMES

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:37.531
INCREDIBLY CRITICAL TO MAKE THAT

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:38.866
BRIGHT IT'S CLEAN AS POSSIBLE SO

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.601
THEN THAT THAT IN THOSE

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:43.537
INSTANCES. THE BUT I KIND OF

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.139
THEIR MISSION- VEHICLE COMPONENT

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:47.107
OF THE PROJECT- BECOMES KIND OF

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.976
THE CENTRAL POINT OF WHAT WE

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:50.377
LOOK FOR- BUT ANOTHER ALL OTHER

01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:51.678
CASES YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE REALLY

01:40:51.745 --> 01:40:57.284
INTERESTED IN- IS- THE MONSTER

01:40:57.351 --> 01:40:59.420
AND ARE PROJECTS AND THEN WE YOU

01:40:59.486 --> 01:41:01.622
KNOW ARE ENCOURAGING WORK WHERE

01:41:01.688 --> 01:41:02.890
IT'S A PROGRAM FOR APPLICANTS TO

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:04.992
LEVERAGE- OTHER DOLLARS FOR ZERO

01:41:05.058 --> 01:41:07.928
EMISSION VEHICLE- EFFORTS AND-

01:41:07.995 --> 01:41:08.495
MOST OF THOSE DOLLARS DON'T

01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:09.530
DIRECTLY COME FROM

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.298
TRANSPORTATION. INFRASTRUCTURE

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:13.734
OF SOURCES ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:14.935
SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS THAT THE

01:41:15.002 --> 01:41:16.804

DURING OUR PUBLIC. FOR BUILDINGS

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:41.395
AN OUTCRY FOR BETTER ACCESS TV

01:41:41.462 --> 01:41:43.230
CHARGING AND THESE ARE

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:45.332
RELATIVELY LOW COST. I AM VERY

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:47.634
COST EFFECTIVE INVESTMENTS IN

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.870
EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.772
THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS. RESIDENT

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:16.630
CHARGING. SERVICES SO THAT THEY

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:18.098
CAN ACTUALLY PURCHASE AND OWN

AND THAT CENTER COMMUNITIES AND

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:32.672
DECISION MAKING SO THE TCC

THE REGIONAL CLIMATE

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:39.679
COLLABORATES PROGRAM WHICH IS A

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:41.448
NEW PROGRAM FOCUSED ON CAPACITY

01:48:41.514 --> 01:48:42.682
BUILDING FOR FRONTLINE%

01:48:42.749 --> 01:48:44.284
COMMUNITIES I'M IN THINKING

01:48:44.351 --> 01:48:44.951
ABOUT SUSTAINABLE COUPLE

01:48:45.018 --> 01:48:46.820
COMMUNITIES I REALLY WANT TO

01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:51.691
POLICYMAKING AROUND IMPACTED

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:52.859
COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES

01:48:52.926 --> 01:48:55.061
SHIPS OUT IN THIS PRESENTATION

01:48:55.128 --> 01:48:56.463
I'M GONNA BE TALKING OF THE NEED

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:57.631
TO BUILD SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES

01:48:57.697 --> 01:48:59.466
FROM THE TOP DOWN. FROM THE

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:04.671
BOTTOM UP AND THEN ALSO.

01:49:04.738 --> 01:49:07.407
EQUITABLE EVALUATION- SO- IF YOU

01:49:07.474 --> 01:49:09.276
JUST TO BROWN AS A BIT I THINK

01:49:09.342 --> 01:49:11.811
WE'VE HEARD OF THE BIT OF. THE

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:12.412
HISTORY AND CREDIT PRACTICES

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:13.647
THAT I'VE CAN. TO REDLINING

01:49:13.713 --> 01:49:14.214
RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION ON

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:15.415
INEQUITABLE OUTCOMES. AT THE

01:49:15.482 --> 01:49:17.751
STATE NOW HAS A RESPONSE AND

01:49:17.817 --> 01:49:18.385
WE'LL- RESPONSIBILITY TO WIELD

01:49:18.451 --> 01:49:19.853
ITS POWER IN THE INTERACTION OF

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.122
CORRECTING INJUSTICES. SO I'VE

01:49:22.188 --> 01:49:23.156
THREE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THREE

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:25.225
COULD NOT PATHWAYS HERE. NUMBER

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:26.626
ONE IS TO BUILD A PATHWAY FROM

01:49:26.693 --> 01:49:27.661
COMMUNITY PLANNING TO

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:29.396
TRANSFORMATIVE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:49:29.462 --> 01:49:30.964
I'M FROM THE TOP DOWN THE STATE

01:49:31.031 --> 01:49:33.566
MUST CHANGE AT ACROSS THE BOARD.

01:49:33.633 --> 01:49:34.834
COMMUNITIES NEED FUNDED TIME TO

01:49:34.901 --> 01:49:36.569
ESTABLISH SHARED VISIONS DEVELOP

01:49:36.636 --> 01:49:38.204
PARTNERSHIPS IDENTIFY SPECIFIC

01:49:38.271 --> 01:49:40.941
PRIORITIES AND- PURSUE PROJECTS.

01:49:41.007 --> 01:49:41.942
SO WE VERY MUCH ENCOURAGE THE

01:49:42.008 --> 01:49:43.410
STATE TO INTEGRATE PLANNING

01:49:43.476 --> 01:49:45.578
GRANTS ALONG WITH. THOSE CAPITAL

01:49:45.645 --> 01:49:47.814
INVESTMENTS. AND THEN THOSE

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.215
THOSE PLANNING RESOURCES HAVE TO

01:49:49.282 --> 01:49:50.250
BE PAIRED WITH THE FINANCIAL

01:49:50.317 --> 01:49:51.785
RESOURCES AND FOR COMMUNITIES TO

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.787
RECEIVE AT TO. FORWARD IN

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:56.122
ADVANCE THERE- TRANSFORMATIVE

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:57.791
VISIONS RIGHT COUNTERING DECADES

01:49:57.857 --> 01:49:59.459
OF DISINVESTMENT. ON AND

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.261
ASSISTANCE REQUIRE THAT WE MAKE

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:02.495
PRETTY LARGE CAPITAL

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.664
INVESTMENTS. IN OUR MOST UNDER

01:50:04.731 --> 01:50:05.532
RESEARCH COMMUNITIES IN WAYS

01:50:05.598 --> 01:50:07.734
THAT ARE GOVERNED BY THOSE

01:50:07.801 --> 01:50:08.368
COMMUNITIES. NUMBER TWO IS TO

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.870
TREAT COMMITTEES A HOLE INTO

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:12.205
MAXIMIZING THE BENEFITS. SO

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:13.606
COMMUNITIES NEED FUNDING FOR

01:50:13.673 --> 01:50:15.508
IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIFIED PLANS

01:50:15.575 --> 01:50:17.644
THAT CAN REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS

01:50:17.711 --> 01:50:18.878
AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL PUBLIC

01:50:18.945 --> 01:50:20.981
HEALTH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIO

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:22.749
ECONOMIC BENEFITS. THIS REALLY

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:24.284
LOOKS LIKE BOTTLING INVESTMENT

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:26.686
TYPES- IN MUCH THE WAY THAT THE

01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:27.654
TCC THE TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:29.155
COMMUNITIES PROGRAM DOES. I'M SO

01:50:29.222 --> 01:50:30.590
THEY WERE REALLY RESPONDING TO

01:50:30.657 --> 01:50:31.758
HOLISTIC COMMUNITY VISION AS

01:50:31.825 --> 01:50:33.026
OPPOSED TO A MIX OF UNPLUGGING

01:50:33.093 --> 01:50:34.394
IT INVESTMENTS THAT COME FROM

01:50:34.461 --> 01:50:35.695
VARIOUS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS

01:50:35.762 --> 01:50:37.797
ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND THE

01:50:37.864 --> 01:50:39.332
NUMBER THREE IS TO REMOVE

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.000
FUNDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

01:50:40.066 --> 01:50:41.968
BARRIERS- PROGRESSIVE POLICY IN

01:50:42.035 --> 01:50:43.436
PROGRAM DESIGN ON ITS OWN IS NOT

01:50:43.503 --> 01:50:45.839
ENOUGH. WE ALSO REALLY NEED TO

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:46.606
REFORM THE INTERNAL

01:50:46.673 --> 01:50:48.475
ADMINISTRATING FINANCING AND

01:50:48.541 --> 01:50:50.276
CONTRACTING PRACTICES. THAT

01:50:50.343 --> 01:50:51.311
CURRENTLY ARE SERVING ISRAEL

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:53.313
BARRIERS AND SOUND PREVENTING

01:50:53.380 --> 01:50:54.381
COMMUNITIES FROM ENGAGING WITH

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:56.983
STATE. INVESTMENT SOURCES AND A

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:59.586
PBLIC POLICY. SO KEEP KIND OF

01:50:59.652 --> 01:51:06.059
EXAMPLE RECOMMENDATION THAT. I

01:51:06.126 --> 01:51:07.327
THINK IT'S COMING UP AND FOR A

01:51:07.394 --> 01:51:08.428
LOT OF COMMUTER D. AS IN THE

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:11.097
NEED TO. THE PAYMENT OF GRANT

01:51:11.164 --> 01:51:11.798
FROM SOME STATE ARE JUST AND

01:51:11.865 --> 01:51:13.400
REMEMBER BASE. ON WHICH WE

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:14.667
PRESENTS A CASH FLOW CHALLENGE

01:51:14.734 --> 01:51:15.402
FOR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

01:51:15.468 --> 01:51:16.336
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:51:16.403 --> 01:51:17.604
AND EVEN SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:18.471
MOST NONPROFITS AND COMMUNITY

01:51:18.538 --> 01:51:19.973
BASED ORGANIZATIONS SIMPLY DO

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.975
NOT HAVE A CASH FLOW TO SUSTAIN

01:51:22.042 --> 01:51:24.010
MULTIPLE MODES. OF OVERHEAD IN

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:25.578
PAYROLL AND BEFORE GETTING

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:28.548
REIMBURSED FOR. WORK AND STATE

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:30.583
FUNDED PROJECTS TO REALLY URGING

01:51:30.650 --> 01:51:32.452
THE STATE TO PERMIT ADVANCE

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:34.487
PAYMENT OF GRANT FUNDS- AND ALSO

01:51:34.554 --> 01:51:35.555
THINGS LIKE COMMUNICATION

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.884
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATIONS HERE-

01:52:04.951 --> 01:52:06.519
NUMBER ONE IS TO DEVELOP

01:52:06.586 --> 01:52:07.020
STRUCTURES FOR COMMUNITY

01:52:21.835 --> 01:52:23.536
TCC PROGRAM THAT WAS SPOKEN OF

01:52:23.603 --> 01:52:25.071
EARLIER REALLY DOES PROVIDE THE

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:26.706
STRONGEST MODEL THAT WE HAVE

THE STAKEHOLDER TYPES IS

01:53:07.614 --> 01:53:09.516

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:02.508
PROCESS AND WE DESIGNED A

01:58:02.575 --> 01:58:03.876
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM AROUND SIR

01:58:03.943 --> 01:58:05.211
THREE GOALS ONE WAS REDUCING

01:58:05.278 --> 01:58:06.979
CONGESTION BUT NOT BY EXPANDING

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:08.781
ROAD BASE BUT BY PROVIDING.

01:58:08.848 --> 01:58:10.049
COMPELLING ALTERNATIVES TO THE

01:58:10.116 --> 01:58:12.652
PRIVATE ON AUTOMOBILE-

01:58:12.718 --> 01:58:14.987
ADDRESSING EQUITY BY INCREASING

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:16.422
ACCESS AND THEN MEETING OUR

01:58:16.489 --> 01:58:17.490
STATE AND FEDERAL MANDATES AND

01:58:17.557 --> 01:58:19.459
SPECIFICALLY- OUR STATE

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:20.927
REQUIREMENTS REDUCE GREENHOUSE

01:58:20.993 --> 01:58:26.766
GAS EMISSIONS BY 19% PER CAPITA

01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.568
BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. WE HAVE

01:58:28.634 --> 01:58:30.269
WE HAVE A LAW WAY TO GO ACHIEVE

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:31.504
GOALS TO AND THE SAN DIEGO

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.638
REGION 12% OF LOW INCOME

01:58:32.705 --> 01:58:34.340
RESIDENTS LIVE WITHIN A HALF

01:58:34.407 --> 01:58:35.808
MILE OF FAST AND FREQUENT

01:58:35.875 --> 01:58:36.676
TRANSIT SERVICE. I MEAN THIS

01:58:36.742 --> 01:58:38.578
REALLY THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.713
80% OF COMMUTERS ON OUR ROADWAYS

01:58:40.780 --> 01:58:42.548
ARE ARE DRIVING ALONG WE WILL BE

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:44.283
ABLE TO FIX THAT PROBLEM- INTEL

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:46.419
WE HAVE COMPELLING ALTERNATIVES

01:58:46.486 --> 01:58:48.521
TO DRIVING ALONE. AND I WAS

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:50.623
REALLY HAPPY TO SEE AN THE

01:58:50.690 --> 01:58:51.624
RECENT PAPERWORK FOR THIS

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:54.093
HEARING THAT DIGITALIZATION- WAS

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.695
CONSIDERED AT TOOL. FOR

01:58:55.761 --> 01:58:57.096
INCREASING SUSTAINABILITY AND

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:58.564
EQUITY TODAY IN OUR REGION WE

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:00.833
HAVE A DIGITAL DIVIDE WE SAW

01:59:00.900 --> 01:59:02.635
FIRST HAND DURING THE PANDEMIC.

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.437
HOW THE LOOK THE FAMILIES THE

01:59:04.504 --> 01:59:05.938
HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE UNCONNECTED

01:59:06.005 --> 01:59:07.573
AND UNDER CONNECTED I'M REALLY

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.909
CUT OFF FROM SOCIETY. STARVATION

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:11.410
THE PLAN FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:59:11.477 --> 01:59:12.545
INCLUDES A DIGITAL EQUITY

01:59:12.612 --> 01:59:14.046
STRATEGY AND ACTIONPLAN AS WELL

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.581
THAT SEEKS TO GET ALL

01:59:15.648 --> 01:59:17.817
HOUSEHOLDS- ONLINE AND THE

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:21.354
SKILLS AND TOOLS THAT THEY NEED

01:59:21.420 --> 01:59:22.788
TO BE ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:23.789
TECHNOLOGY. SOURCE STRATEGY FOR

01:59:23.856 --> 01:59:25.391
ACHIEVING THE GOALS ON OUR PLAN

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:26.726
IS WHAT WE CALL THE FIVE BIG

01:59:26.792 --> 01:59:28.794
MOVES THE FIVE BIG LIVES WORK

01:59:28.861 --> 01:59:30.530
TOGETHER TO CREATE A COMPLETE.

01:59:30.596 --> 01:59:33.533
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM- STARTING

01:59:33.599 --> 01:59:35.101
WITH A COMPLETE CORRIDORS

01:59:35.167 --> 01:59:36.869
COMPLETE WHERE TO WHERE'S OUR

01:59:36.936 --> 01:59:38.538
MULTIMODAL ROADWAYS THAT USED

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:40.339
TECHNOLOGY TO ACTIVELY MANAGE

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:41.574
HOW THEY'RE USED BASED ON REAL

01:59:41.641 --> 01:59:43.209
TIME CONDITIONS AND THEY- THEY

01:59:43.276 --> 01:59:44.677
ADDRESS CONGESTION IN TWO WAYS

01:59:44.744 --> 01:59:46.612
FIRST THEY REALLY MAXIMIZE THE

01:59:46.679 --> 01:59:48.147
INVESTMENT IN OUR EXISTING

01:59:48.214 --> 01:59:49.348
INFRASTRUCTURE. BY CONVERTING

01:59:49.415 --> 01:59:50.616
GENERAL PURPOSE LANES THE

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.552
MANAGED LANES THAT GIVE PRIORITY

01:59:52.618 --> 01:59:54.487
TO TRANSIT AND SHARED MOBILITY

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:56.188
HIGHER OCCUPANCY MODES. AND THEN

01:59:56.255 --> 01:59:56.889
THEY PROVIDE THAT NEW

01:59:56.956 --> 01:59:58.558
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THOSE HIGH

01:59:58.624 --> 02:00:00.192
SPEED HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSIT

02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:01.928
LEAD SERVICE SAYS- BUT DO

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:06.132
PROVIDE A VIABLE AND COMPETITIVE

02:00:06.198 --> 02:00:06.832
ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR.

02:00:06.899 --> 02:00:08.100
FLEXIBLE FLEETS THIS IS REALLY

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:09.602
BUILDING UPON THE POPULARITY OF

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.203
HALFPENNY BUILD SHARED MOBILITY

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:13.806
SERVICES WE'VE INCORPORATED-

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.942
EVERYTHING FROM SHARED BIKES AND

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:18.678
SCOOTERS TO MICRO TRANSIT. AND

02:00:18.744 --> 02:00:19.845
YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WORKING

02:00:19.912 --> 02:00:20.613
UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT IT

02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:22.615
EVENTUALLY THESE WILL BE-

02:00:22.682 --> 02:00:24.717
CONNECTED ELECTRIC AND

02:00:24.784 --> 02:00:26.319
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES AS WELL.

02:00:26.385 --> 02:00:27.653
MOBILITY HUBS THIS REALLY

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.021
EMBODIES THAT FIFTEEN MINUTE

02:00:29.088 --> 02:00:30.056
COMMUNITY THAT WE'VE BEEN

02:00:30.122 --> 02:00:32.058
TALKING ABOUT MOBILITY HUBS ARE

02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:33.392
CONNECTED COMMUNITIES WHERE

02:00:33.459 --> 02:00:35.528
THERE IS SAFE MULTIMODAL

02:00:35.595 --> 02:00:37.096
INFRASTRUCTURE IT'S EASY TO GET

02:00:37.163 --> 02:00:38.531
AROUND I'M WITHOUT A CAR AND

02:00:38.598 --> 02:00:40.366
THIS IS WHERE WE'RE FOCUSING.

02:00:40.433 --> 02:00:42.101
OUR HOUSING AND COMMERCIAL-

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:44.003
GROWTH INTO THE FUTURE AS WELL.

02:00:44.070 --> 02:00:45.504
AND THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST IS

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:47.873
WHAT WE CALL THE BRAIN OF THE

02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:48.808
ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM THE

02:00:48.874 --> 02:00:50.142
NEXT OPERATING SYSTEM THIS IS

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:52.378
THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE DATA THAT

02:00:52.445 --> 02:00:54.780
WE USE TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM IN A

02:00:54.847 --> 02:00:56.215
GREAT SERVICE AS PROVIDE BETTER

02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:57.917
REAL TIME. INFORMATION AND AGAIN

02:00:57.984 --> 02:00:59.318
THIS IS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

02:00:59.385 --> 02:01:00.853
THAT WE HAVE A DIGITAL EQUITY

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:02.321
STRATEGY TO GO ALONG WITH OUR

02:01:02.388 --> 02:01:04.190
PLAN BECAUSE TECHNOLOGY IS THE

02:01:04.256 --> 02:01:06.058
WAY OF THE FUTURE AND WE WANT

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:06.959
EVERYONE TO BENEFIT. IN ORDER TO

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:08.594
GO FROM THESE HIGH LEVEL

02:01:08.661 --> 02:01:10.196
CONCEPTS DOWN TO. ACTUAL

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:11.897
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK WE WENT

02:01:11.964 --> 02:01:14.400
THROUGH. A PROCESS OF LOOKING AT

02:01:14.467 --> 02:01:16.369
HOW PEOPLE WANT TO WE NEED TO

02:01:16.435 --> 02:01:17.603
MOVE AROUND THE REGION AND THIS

02:01:17.670 --> 02:01:19.505
IS ONE EXAMPLE THIS IS WHERE

02:01:19.572 --> 02:01:20.673
PEOPLE LIVE AND WORK IN THE SAN

02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:22.908
DIEGO REGION TODAY- THE MAP ON

02:01:22.975 --> 02:01:23.976
THE LEFT THERE WITH THE PINKS

02:01:24.043 --> 02:01:25.978
AND PURPLES- IS POPULATION

02:01:26.045 --> 02:01:27.446
DENSITY THE DARKER THE COLOR THE

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:28.614
MORE PEOPLE LIVING IN THOSE

02:01:28.681 --> 02:01:30.816
AREAS. THE BLUES THE MAP WITH

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:32.451
THE BLUES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:33.419
THESE ARE REPLACEMENT CENTERS

02:01:33.486 --> 02:01:34.587
THIS IS WHERE THE HIGHEST

02:01:34.654 --> 02:01:35.821
CONCENTRATION OF JOBS ARE WITHIN

02:01:35.888 --> 02:01:37.623
THE REACH AND- AND ON THE MAP ON

02:01:37.690 --> 02:01:39.925
THE RIGHT USES- BOTH CENSUS

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:42.928
DATA. AND CELL PHONE DATA- TO

02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:44.463
LOOK AT WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING

02:01:44.530 --> 02:01:46.232
FROM TO ACCESS THESE JOB

02:01:46.298 --> 02:01:47.867
CENTERS. AND THEN WE DID THIS

02:01:47.933 --> 02:01:50.403
KIND OF ANALYSIS FOR YOU KNOW-

02:01:50.469 --> 02:01:51.804
ALL OTHER TYPES OF ACTIVITY

02:01:51.871 --> 02:01:54.740
CENTERS- EDUCATION OUR MILITARY

02:01:54.807 --> 02:01:56.575
BASES WHICH WE HAVE QUITE A FEW

02:01:56.642 --> 02:01:58.110
IN THE SAN DIEGO REGION

02:01:58.177 --> 02:01:59.045
RECREATIONAL DESTINATION SO WE

02:01:59.111 --> 02:02:01.280
GOT A REAL GOOD SENSE. FOR WHAT-

02:02:01.347 --> 02:02:03.149
CONNECTIVITY'S NEEDS WERE AND

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:04.817
THE SAN DIEGO EACH I. MEAN

02:02:04.884 --> 02:02:06.619
BEYOND LOOKING AT DATA LIKE THIS

02:02:06.686 --> 02:02:08.554
WE ALSO WENT THROUGH. A ROBUST

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:10.623
OUT PROCESS WE PARTNER WITH AND

02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:12.358
PROVIDE RESOURCES TO COMMUNITY

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:13.659
BASED ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY CAN

02:02:13.726 --> 02:02:14.727
HELP BRING THE SOCIAL EQUITY

02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:16.629
PERSPECTIVE TO US. GET THE WORD

02:02:16.696 --> 02:02:18.330
OUT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING AND

02:02:18.397 --> 02:02:19.699
GET INPUT BACK TO LAST ON WHAT

02:02:19.765 --> 02:02:24.336
UNITY'S. NEED OUT OF THE

02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:25.337
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. SO THIS

02:02:25.404 --> 02:02:26.605
ALLOWED US THAN TO- TRANSFORM

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:27.973
THESE CONCEPTS INTO A COMPLETE

02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:29.341
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK STARTING

02:02:29.408 --> 02:02:31.711
WITH THE MOBILITY HUBS- ADDING

02:02:31.777 --> 02:02:34.780
IN OUR- COMPLETE CORRIDORS THE

02:02:34.847 --> 02:02:36.682
MANAGED LANES RAPID TRANSIT

02:02:36.749 --> 02:02:38.751
SERVICES. IMPROVING OUR LIGHT

02:02:38.818 --> 02:02:40.352
RAIL THAT EXIST TODAY SPEEDING

02:02:40.419 --> 02:02:42.088
IT UP. AND THEN ADDING COMMUTER

02:02:42.154 --> 02:02:44.256
RAIL WHICH IS THAT HIGH SPEED-

02:02:44.323 --> 02:02:47.259
SERVICE THAT- I'LL- WE DON'T

02:02:47.326 --> 02:02:48.994
HAVE IN THE REGION TODAY. BUT

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:51.197
THEY CAN MAKE THOSE LONGER

02:02:51.263 --> 02:02:52.998
CONNECTIONS QUICKER FOR PEOPLE.

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:54.433
AND THIS ALLOWED US TO NOT JUST

02:02:54.500 --> 02:02:55.701
MEET BUT EXCEED OUR GREENHOUSE

02:02:55.768 --> 02:02:58.137
GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET BY

02:02:58.204 --> 02:03:00.339
TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. ENDS OUR OUR

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:01.874
HOUSING GOALS FOR ADDING A

02:03:01.941 --> 02:03:03.275
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND

02:03:03.342 --> 02:03:05.945
MORE THAN A HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE

02:03:06.011 --> 02:03:06.579
THOUSAND NEW HOMES AND MOST OF

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:08.514
THOSE HOMES ARE BEING ADDED

02:03:08.581 --> 02:03:09.949
WITHIN THOSE MOBILITY HUBS. AND

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:11.617
YOU CAN SEE HERE- THAT A LARGE

02:03:11.684 --> 02:03:13.919
PART OF LOW INCOME MINORITY-

02:03:13.986 --> 02:03:16.122
SENIOR POPULATIONS- ARE LIVING

02:03:16.188 --> 02:03:17.623
WITHIN THOSE MOBILITY HUBS IN

02:03:17.690 --> 02:03:19.125
THE YEAR TWENTY FIFTEEN MORE

WHAT ARE ACCESS TO

02:03:32.538 --> 02:03:34.473
TRANSPORTATION- AND YOU'LL SEE

02:03:34.540 --> 02:03:36.408
BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE WE'VE

02:03:36.475 --> 02:03:38.210
INCREASED THAT- SUBSTANTIALLY

02:03:38.277 --> 02:03:40.446
AND BY TWENTY FIFTY EVEN MORE SO

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:42.548
WE GO FROM. NO 12% OF LOW INCOME

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:45.351

TAKING TRANSIT WALKING AND

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:04.570
BIKING- FOR THEIR COMMUTE. SO

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:05.638
THAT IS THE END OF THE

02:04:05.704 --> 02:04:07.439
PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO

02:04:07.506 --> 02:04:09.175
ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND HAVING

02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:11.644
MORE OF A DISCUSSION THANK YOU.

GREAT WAY TO END OUR

02:04:20.019 --> 02:04:22.021
PRESENTATIONS WITH A PLAN THAT

02:04:22.087 --> 02:04:23.656
RECOGNIZES THE CONNECTION

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:24.623
BETWEEN HOUSING AND

02:04:24.690 --> 02:04:26.692
TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY. AND

02:04:26.759 --> 02:04:28.694
DOESN'T OVER EMPHASIZED THE

02:04:28.761 --> 02:04:31.230
IMPORTANCE OF ELECTRIFICATION OF

DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES SO I

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.714
WOULD SAY. OVERALL OVER THE

02:07:35.781 --> 02:07:37.216
YEARS WE HAVE FOUND INCREASING

02:07:37.282 --> 02:07:38.484
RECEPTIVITY TO THESE KINDS OF

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:40.652
IDEAS AROUND AND THE NEED TO

STATE AGENCIES ARE A REALLY

02:07:49.161 --> 02:07:50.029
LARGE BUREAUCRACIES IT IS LIKE

02:07:50.095 --> 02:07:51.830
IT'S LIKE PUSHING AN ELEPHANT UP

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:54.299
THE HILL- BECAUSE CHALLENGING TO

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:55.367
WORK THROUGH NOT ONLY PROGRAM

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:56.668
DESIGNED BUT ALSO SOME OF THE

02:07:56.735 --> 02:07:58.704
LIKE INTERNAL ADMINISTRATIVE AND

02:07:58.771 --> 02:08:00.706
BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS SEES. THAT

02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:01.940
I THINK MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

02:08:02.007 --> 02:08:04.176
COMMUNITIES TO ADAM. TO WORK

02:08:04.243 --> 02:08:06.745

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:14.353
COUNCIL IN PARTICULAR- AS AN

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:16.588
INTER AGENCY BODY AS AN AGENCY

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:17.956
THAT I THINK IS. SMALLER AND

02:08:18.023 --> 02:08:19.591
MORE NIMBLE IS ABLE TO TAKE ON

02:08:19.658 --> 02:08:21.026
KIND OF MORE CREATIVE PROBLEM

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:23.495
