A SO MAKING A RESOLUTION ONE THIRTY BY FAMILY MEMBER WEBER AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO AFRICAN DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES IN THE UNITED STATES. DOCTOR WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES GOOD MORNING MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT TO YOU ACR ONE THIRTY. AUGUST TWENTY. NINETEEN MARKS THE FOUR HUNDRED YEARS SINCE THE FIRST AFRICAN CHAO'S SLADE WAS BROUGHT BY SHIP TO VIRGINIA. THE FIRST OF MANY VOYAGES BETWEEN SIXTEEN NINETEEN IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE ABOUT FOUR MILLION AFRICANS TO BE ENSLAVED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER THAT THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME AFRICANS CAME TO THE NEW WORLD. IN FACT AT THE I HAVEN'T BEEN SORT OF WAS WHAT THEY CAME BEFORE COLUMBUS DOCUMENTS THAT MAKE YOU SICK THE CIRCUMVENTING THE WORLD AND LANDING IN THE AMERICAS. WE ALWAYS THINK OF CALIFORNIA AS AN EXCEPTION TO THE EVILS OF AFRICAN SLAVERY. WHAT CALIFORNIA ENTERED THE UNION IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY AS A FREE STATE WAS LABOR WAS NOMINALLY ILLEGAL AND SIDED WITH AND SIDE WITH THE UNION DURING THE CIVIL WAR. THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED BLACKS LAYS IN THE STATE BY EIGHTEEN FIFTY TWO. MANY BROUGHT BY SOUTHERNERS WHO WERE LOWER TO CALIFORNIA BY THE GOLD RUSH. IN THE EARLY EIGHTEEN FIFTIES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND THE JUDICIARY CONSTRUCTED A WEBER STATUTES AND LEGAL RULINGS THAT UNDERCUT IN SLAVE. PEOPLE'S CLAIM TO FREEDOM AND COMMITTED THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO COMPELLING SLATE WILL BE THE ANSWER WE HAVE A FUGITIVE SLAVES TO RETURN TO THEIR OWNERS. THE COP YOU LET YOUR FOUGHT. FREE BLACKS FROM IMMIGRATING OR LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNMENT PERPETUATED CONDONED AND PROFITED FROM PRACTICES THAT BRUTALIZE AND DISADVANTAGED AFRICANS IN AMERICA AND THEIR DESCENDANTS INCLUDING SHARECROPPING CONVICT CONVICT LEASING JIM CROW LAWS READ READ READ LINING UNEQUAL EDUCATION AND THE DISPROPORTIONATE. TREATMENT AT THE HANDS OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. CALIFORNIA MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A MISSISSIPPI OR ALABAMA BUT OUR LAWS AND INSTITUTIONS NONE THE LESS. ENABLE CHATTEL SLAVERY HERE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE LONG TERM LONG AFFECT OF SLAVERY ON THE DESCENDANTS OF BLACK SLAVES TO IT TO THIS DAY. OUR ANCESTORS WERE BROUGHT HERE INVOLUNTARILY TO PROVIDE FREE LABOR. BUT EVEN LONG AFTER EMANCIPATION CALIFORNIA LAWS CUSTOMS AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES WORKED AND STILL WORK. TO IMPEDE OUR FULL INTEGRATION TO THE ECONOMIC LEGAL AND POLITICAL LIFE OF THE STATE. THE FACTS ARE THAT BLACKS ARE STILL UNDERPAID. UNDEREMPLOYED UNDER EDUCATED OVER POLICED AN OVER REPRESENTED IN PRISONS AND JAILS. I BRING THIS RESOLUTION FOR BECAUSE IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE AN OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT PRACTICAL STEPS WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT. REPARATIONS REPARATIONS IS NOT A HAND OUT. REPARATIONS ABOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THE GREAT WRONG CALIFORNIAN GAYS IN BY ENABLING ILLEGAL SLAVERY TO CONTINUE IN THE STATE. FOR REFUSING TO PROVIDE ASYLUM FOR FUGITIVE SLAVES BUT PASSING LAWS THAT WILL PREVENT FREED SLAVES OF LIVING HERE. AND FOR PASSING LAWS THAT PERPETUATED THE INJUSTICES OF SLAVERY AFTER HAD BEEN ABOLISHED. THIS TOPIC HAS LONG BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY AND CLEAR RENOUNCING SLAVIN INEQUALITY IS NO LONGER SUFFICIENT. ACTION IS REQUIRED TO RECORD BEEN WRECKED RECTIFY THIS INJUSTICE. REPARATIONS ARE PRACTICAL REMEDY FOR THE ACUTE ECONOMIC LEGAL POLITICAL EDUCATIONAL INJUSTICES RESULTING FROM SLAVERY WELL EXPERIENCED BY BLACK DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES TO THIS DAY.

SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY ONE BY SENATOR GLAZER AND OTHERS AN ACT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MR QUIRK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YES THANK YOU SPEAKER IN MEMBERS WITH PERMISSION OF THE- LEGISLATURE I'D LIKE TO READ THE LETTER OF SUPPORT FOR THIS FROM THE LEAGUE OF CITIES WITHOUT OBJECTION. THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY ONE WHICH WOULD ON OR AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY POSIT PROSPECTIVELY. BAND SALES TAX REBATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN A RETAILER AND LOCAL AGENCY INVOLVING BRADLEY BURNS SALES AND USE TAXES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RETAILER LOCATING OR CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A PLACE OF SALE TO GENERATE AND REBATE REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF CHANGEABLE PROPERTY. DELIVERY TO AND RECEIVED BY THE PURCHASER IN THE TERRITORIAL JURISDICTION OF ANOTHER CITY OR COUNTY. THIS MEASURE IS CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES DEVELOPED BY THE LEAGUE AS PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE MULTI YEAR REVIEW OF ISSUES RELATED TO COLLECTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF SALES AND USE TAX. THE LEAGUE'S POLICY STATES THAT SALES TAX AGREEMENTS INVOLVING ONLINE RETAILS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE EFFECT OF ENCOURAGING REVENUE TO BE SHIFTED AWAY FROM NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES AND CONCENTRATED TO THE BENEFIT OF ONE AGENCY WITH A PORTION THEN REBATED TO THE RETAILER. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE ONLY APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY AND DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH ANY ADJUSTING THE EXISTING AGREEMENT OR WITH THE ABILITY OF A LOCAL AGENCY TO OFFER ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS ACTIVES WITH ITS OWN REVENUE. NOR DOES CHANGE THE EXISTING ROLES FOR DETERMINING THE PLACE FOR SALE WITH THE INCREASING VOLUME OF INTERNET SALES A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SALES TAX REVENUE CAN BE CONCENTRATED IN A RETAILER'S WAREHOUSE SALES OFFICE OR FOR THE FITMENT CENTER. WHICH MAKES LOCATING THESE FACILITIES AND INTENCIóN PROSPECT FOR LOCAL AGENCIES IN AGREEMENT THAT BENEFITS ONE AGENCY BY SHIFTING THE POINT OF SALE CAN COME AT THE PHYSICAL HARM TO MANY OTHERS. SB FIVE THREE ONE WOULD PROHIBIT FUTURE. EIGHT AGREEMENTS THE RESULT IN SALES TAX REVENUE FROM BEING SHIFTED AWAY FROM NUMEROUS COMMUNITIES AND CONCENTRATED TO THE BENEFIT OF ONE AGENCY. WITH A PORTION REBATED TO A RETAILER. MEMBERS THIS IS ABOUT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ASKING US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A RACE TO THE BOTTOM WE DON'T HAVE ONE AGENCY REPEATING TO A YOU ONLINE RETAILER IN ORDER TO TAKE REVENUE AWAY FROM OTHER CITIES THE CITIES THEMSELVES ARE ASKING US TO MAKE THIS FAIR. I REQUEST YOU ARRIVE OUT. THANK YOU MISTER QUIRK MISTER PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU. MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL FOR SOME VERY OBVIOUS REASONS. FRESNO AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY SUCCESSFUL IN BEING COMPETITIVE AND PROVIDING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. YEAH IMPROVED THAT COOPERATION WITHOUT WITH LARGE SCALE EMPLOYERS IT HAS BEEN A SUCCESS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME AND I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT OUR AREA. FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME HAS SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT WELL BELOW DOUBLE DIGITS. AND SO OUR MEMBERS AB THIS REALLY I THINK IS ABOUT. COMPETITION IT REALLY IS ABOUT DECIDING THAT THERE ARE COMPANIES AND WHO MAKE A DEEP COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO HIRING AND IT DOES HELP OUT CERTAINLY REGIONS THAT HAVE BEEN. IN MANY INSTANCES HAVE SICK A SIGNIFICANT A DIFFICULTY IN ACQUIRING AND RETAINING A REALLY GOOD A JOB CREATORS MEMBERS DON'T TAKE AWAY A FUNDAMENTAL. NOT HISTORIC TOOL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE DOT IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE IN OUR AREA WHO WANT GOOD JOBS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THEM. SO PLEASE I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU ARE VOTE NO ON THIS AND PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THE VERY. PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT NOW ENJOYING JOBS HUGE EXPANSIONS AND QUITE FRANKLY A HISTORIC DECLINE IN UNEMPLOYMENT IN A REGION THAT HAS HAD HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT FOR A LONG TIME. WE ARE ASKED DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY. THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THESE TOOLS ALLOW US TO DO AND IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY USED TO DIVERSIFY CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND FRESNO'S ECONOMY TO THE ADVANTAGE AND THE BENEFIT. OF HARD WORKING PEOPLE IN THE OUR REGION WHO WANT A JOB AND WHAT A PATHWAY. TO HOMEOWNERSHIP AND- PLEASE KEEP THEM IN MIND THIS IS A TOOL THAT WE USE SUCCESSFULLY AND CONTINUE TO SEEK TO USE IT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OUT I APPRECIATE IT VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER PATTERSON MISTER EMILY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND I MUST JOIN MY COLLEAGUE THE FORMER MAYOR OF FRESNO AND RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. AND WHILE ALL CITIES MAY NOT BE CREATED EQUAL WE DO COME FROM THE FIFTH LARGEST CITY IN CALIFORNIA AND OUR VOICE SHOULD BE HEARD AS WELL. NOW MY MAYOR AND LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE ASKED ME TO STAND AND RISE IN OPPOSITION AND IT'S OUT OF RESPECT TO BOTH THE AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE AND TO MY COLLEAGUE WHO'S PRESENTING IT ON THE FLOOR. THAT I SIMPLY READ. THEIR OPPOSITION SO THAT WE MAY BE HEARD IN THIS DISCUSSION. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WILL TAKE AWAY A VITAL TOOL FOR THE CITY OF FRESNO AND OTHER CITIES AROUND THE STATE THAT HAVE USED THIS TO CREATE LOCAL JOB GROWTH. SB FIVE THIRTY ONE WILL ELIMINATE THE ABILITY OF CITIES TO PROVIDE REBATES TO BUSINESSES LOOKING TO OPEN NEW FACILITIES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. IN THE PAST FEW YEARS FRESNO HAS USED THIS SALES TAX INCENTIVES TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES LOOKING TO COME TO OUR CITY THIS HAS HELPED TO CREATE FOUR THOUSAND JOBS. DRAMATICALLY TRANSFORMING THE ECONOMIC SITUATION AND ONE OF THE POOREST PARTS OF OUR STATE. FREIGHT FRESNO'S SALES TAX INITIATIVE IN INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS ARE PERFORMANCE AND JOB. CREATION BASED AND IF THE JOBS AREN'T CREATED THE INCENTIVES AREN'T OFFERED THE BOTTOM LINE FOR CITIES LIKE FRESNO IS THAT THIS TOOL IS OFTEN TIMES THEIR ONLY OPTION THIS BILL THE BILL STYMIED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FRESNO RESIDENTS A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT OF POVERTY. WHICH IN TURN WILL RESULT IN NEGATIVE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT NOT JUST IN FRESNO BUT FOR ALL CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON SB FIVE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER áREA MISTER MEDINA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED ON THIS MATTER. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO SB FIVE THIRTY ONE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TYPES OF INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS BUT THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR. WHAT WE NEED pACCOUNTABILITY IN THESE AGREEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING LOCAL JOBS A LOCAL BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH THIS BILL DOESN'T MAKE CHANGES TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUES FROM THESE AGREEMENTS THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN OPEN ABOUT HIS DESIRE TO SHIFT YOU COMMERCE REVENUE FROM THE PLACE OF DISTRIBUTION TO THE PLACE OF DELIVERY. WITH SEVERAL DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN MY DISTRICT SUCH A CHANGE WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO LOCAL BUDGETS. TAKEN AWAY REVENUES FROM THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES WERE DOING THE LABOR TO GET ONLINE GOODS DISTRIBUTED. ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF PARIS THAT I REPRESENT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON SB FIVE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER MEDINA MISS REST YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS ARE TO RISE IN OPPOSITION OF ELSE BE FIVE THIRTY ONE. AS WE KNOW THE FOR RIGHT THE RETAILER HAS ONE LOCATION OF THE STATE. THAT LOCATION IS DETERMINED TO BE THE PLACE OF SALE. IF THE RETAILER HAS NO SALES A RETAIL LOCATIONS IN THE STATE WHAT HOUSING FULFILLMENT OPERATION WITHIN THE STATE THE PLACE OF SALE IS DETERMINED TO BE WHERE THE ORDER IS SHIPPED FROM. THE INLAND EMPIRE INCLUDING THE REGION IN SANDRA DINO COUNTY HAS BECOME HOME TO A LARGE NUMBER OF FULFILLMENT CENTERS AND WAREHOUSES FOR ONLINE RETAILERS. MY OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE DOES NOT MEAN THAT I WANT MORE WAREHOUSES OR MORE FULFILLMENT CENTERS IN MY COMMUNITY. BECAUSE MANY OF THESE BRING ADVERSE AFFECTS TO OUR ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH OF OUR RESIDENTS. BUT I ALSO WILL NOT ACCEPT THE TAKING AWAY OF THOSE INCENTIVES GIVEN OR TO BE GIVEN IN THE FUTURE. THE IMPACTS TO EXISTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS AS WELL AS IMPACTS TO AGREEMENTS CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATIONS A FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THIS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON SB FIVE THIRTY ONE THANK YOU MISS REYES MISTER GRAY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I JOIN MY COLLEAGUES IN OPPOSING THIS MEASURE FORCE THEY MEMBERS AND WOULD LIKE TO POSE A QUESTION. TO THE BODY. WHEN WE WELL WHEN I ARRIVED HERE IN TWENTY TWELVE NEWLY ELECTED WE WERE ON THE HEELS OF HAVING A LIMITED REDEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE AS A TOOL FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES TO GROW THE ECONOMY FIVE JOBS PARTICULARLY IN PORTIONS OF THE STATE LIKE THE SOUNDS ABOUT LIKE MY DISTRICT WHERE WE STILL STRUGGLE EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY WITH HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND RATES OF POVERTY THAT ARE FAR TOO HIGH. AND WE DISCUSSED DOING SOMETHING TO GIVE LOCAL CHURCHES BACK SOME TOOLS AND WE'VE DISCUSSED IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN OUR TWENTY NINETEEN NOT TWENTY TWELVE WE STILL HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO DEAL WITH THE FALLOUT FROM REDEVELOPMENT HERE I FIND ARE. ANOTHER TOOL. LIVING ELIMINATED AND I THINK IT'S JUST A GOOD MOMENT FOR THE BODY TO POTS AND TO ASK OURSELVES WHAT ACTIONS ARE WE ARE WE CAN ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION. TO REVITALIZE THE USERS STATE AND FINE IF THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT TOOL HERE. IF REDEVELOPMENT WASN'T THE RIGHT TOOL THEN WHAT ARE THE RIGHT TOOLS AND HOW CAN WE ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO. TODAY THIS IS NOT. THE PATH FORWARD AND I RICHARD NO VOTE. ON SB FIVE TO ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER GRAHAM IS OBERNOLTE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT. OF SB FIVE THIRTY ONE AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL TAKE A STEP BACK. AND THINK ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS NOT JUST IN THE REGIONS THAT WE COME FROM BUT IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE POLICY. OF HAVING DIFFERENT CITIES COMPETE WITH EACH OTHER TO SEE HOW MUCH TAX REVENUE THEY CAN GIVE A WAY TO LOWER A COMPANY. TO LOCATE. A FULFILLMENT CENTER IN THEIR CITY IS NOT A GOOD ONE IT'S NOT A GOOD ONE. FOR CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLEAND ALTHOUGH IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR THAT PARTICULAR CITY IF THEY GET THAT FULFILLMENT CENTER. IT'S NOT GOOD FOR ALL OF OUR CITIES PUT TOGETHER AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE REPRESENTING AN AREA OF THE STATE. THAT ACTUALLY DOES BETTER THAN NOT UNDER THE CURRENT POLICY SO YOU KNOW THAT MY THOUGHTS ARE SINCERE. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AS A BODY. AT THIS ENTIRE POLICY OF HOUSE SALES TAX REVENUE ON ON LINE SALES IS DISTRIBUTED. YEAH I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT NEXT YEAR WE WILL SIT DOWN AND HAVE THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT IS NOT. SORT OF GOING TO A STORE THAT THE SALES TAX REVENUE FROM THAT SALE GOES TO A CITY OTHER THE NEEDLES BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN NEEDLES. THERE DEPENDING ON AT THAT REVENUE TO PAVE THE STREETS AND A POLICE THE COMMUNITY AND WE'RE TAKING THAT REVENUE AWAY FROM THEM. SO I THINK THAT WE REALLY AS A STATE NEED TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE POLICY. OF WHERE THE NEXUS OF THOSE SALES ARE BECAUSE I THINK IT OUGHT TO BE CLEARLY. THE I. LOCATION OF WHERE THOSE GOODS ARE SHIPPED TO NOT WEAR THOSE GOODS ARE SHIPPED FROM. BUT IN THE MEANTIME AT THIS CLOSES A OF VERY ON HOLD THE ON HEALTHY LOOPHOLE. AND I REGION I VOTE.
