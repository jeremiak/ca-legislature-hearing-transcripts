THE DEPARTMENT CSTA HAD SEVERAL

00:26:23.315 --> 00:26:23.882
CORE PILLARS THAT WE WANTED TO

00:26:23.949 --> 00:26:25.417
FOLLOW -- ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT

00:26:25.483 --> 00:26:27.385
WE WANTED TO EXISTS IMPROVE

OF THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:40.999
WHAT'S THE HOLD HARMLESS DEALS

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:47.639
THIS IS A ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED

00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.239
MORE THAN WHAT THE METHODOLOGY

00:26:48.306 --> 00:26:50.008
WOULD CALCULATE -- FROM THAT THE

00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:51.476
FUNDAMENTAL CORE METHODOLOGY

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.545
INCOMES THREE MAJOR COMPONENTS --

WORK OPERATIONS TO CALL CENTER

00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:58.183
OPERATIONS AND THREE A

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:00.585
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE COMPONENT.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.254
FOR CASE WORK OPERATIONS CSTA IN

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:05.657
THE L. -- THE CSA'S AND DECSS

00:27:05.724 --> 00:27:07.525
SELECTED FIFTEEN LCS ACE TO

00:27:07.592 --> 00:27:08.660
SAMPLE I'M RANGING FROM VERY

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:09.828
LARGE SUCH AS LOS ANGELES TO

00:27:09.894 --> 00:27:10.795
SMALL -- SUCH AS MARIN TO

CONDUCT LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDIES

00:27:11.863 --> 00:27:14.432
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE TASKS

00:27:14.499 --> 00:27:15.400
AND THE AMOUNT OF EFFORT IT

00:27:15.467 --> 00:27:17.268
TAKES ON AVERAGE FOR STAFF TO

00:27:17.335 --> 00:27:18.436
COMPLETE A WIDE ARRAY OF

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.071
MANDATORY CASE WORK TASKS.

00:27:20.138 --> 00:27:21.406
THESE TESTS INCLUDING SUCH AS

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:23.274
OPENING CASES ESTABLISHING

00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.076
ORDERS AND FORCING ORDERS.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:32.917
AS A RESULT OF THAT EFFORT --

00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:33.752
THE LEVEL OF EFFORT STUDY

00:27:33.818 --> 00:27:34.819
YIELDED RESULTS THAT ESTIMATED

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:37.322
IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY A

00:27:37.389 --> 00:27:38.790
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN CASES FOUR

00:27:38.857 --> 00:27:39.624
ONE F. T..

00:27:39.691 --> 00:27:41.626
AND BASED ON THAT RATIO --

00:27:41.693 --> 00:27:44.129
THERE'S ALSO A TWENTY POINT 9%

00:27:44.195 --> 00:27:45.730
WE ANY COMPONENT ADDED ON TOP OF

00:27:45.797 --> 00:27:47.832
THAT FOR COSTS SUCH AS FACILITY

00:27:47.899 --> 00:27:49.567
LEASES CONTRACTS MAINTENANCE

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:52.470
UTILITIES AND OTHER OR ANY NEEDS.

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:53.538
THE SECOND COMPONENT THE FOR

00:27:53.605 --> 00:27:54.406
CALL CENTER OPERATIONS IS BUILT

00:27:54.472 --> 00:27:55.306
AROUND.

00:27:55.373 --> 00:27:58.410
THE RATIO OF CAUGHT -- CALLS PER

00:27:58.476 --> 00:27:59.277
FTE.

00:27:59.344 --> 00:28:00.311
THE APARTMENT LOOKED AT HOW

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:00.812
CURRENT CALL CENTERS ARE

00:28:00.879 --> 00:28:03.381
OPERATING TODAY AND DECIDED THAT

00:28:03.448 --> 00:28:07.252
A RATIO SIXTY SIX THOUSAND I'M

00:28:07.318 --> 00:28:10.455
SORRY.

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:11.089
SIX THOUSAND AND THIRTY COST PER

00:28:11.156 --> 00:28:14.726
FTE -- AS THE METRIC BY WHICH TO

00:28:14.793 --> 00:28:16.428
MEASURE PERFORMANCE AND FUNDING --

00:28:16.494 --> 00:28:18.663
THIS IS KIND OF A MIDDLE GROUND

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.532
BETWEEN LC ESSAYS ARE CUTTING

00:28:20.598 --> 00:28:21.166
RUNNING CURRENTLY RUNNING CALL

00:28:21.232 --> 00:28:22.567
CENTERS EFFICIENTLY AND SOME

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:24.035
THAT FALL A LITTLE BIT BELOW THE

00:28:24.102 --> 00:28:25.070
THRESHOLD.

00:28:25.136 --> 00:28:26.704
AND WITH THE NEED TO IMPROVE

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:29.674
THEIR PERFORMANCE TO MEET -- THE

00:28:29.741 --> 00:28:31.409
EXPECTATIONS.

00:28:31.476 --> 00:28:32.811
THE THIRD COMPONENT IS FOR

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:34.646
PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES -- THE

00:28:34.712 --> 00:28:35.814
DEPARTMENT DELTA CAM

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.848
PERFORMANCES CENTER MODEL THAT

00:28:36.915 --> 00:28:38.450
LOOKS AT TWO COMPONENTS THE

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:41.086
FIRST IS -- TOTAL COLLECTIONS AT

00:28:41.152 --> 00:28:42.754
FOR NOW CSA AND THE SECOND IS

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:43.922
COLLECTION PER CASE.

00:28:43.988 --> 00:28:45.623
THE REASON FOR PICKING THESE TWO

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:46.958
POINTS MATCHES IS OBVIOUSLY THE

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:48.893
PRIME EXISTS -- TO EFFECTUALLY

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.495
COLLECTIONS FOR FAMILIES BUT WE

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.963
DIDN'T WANT TO SIMPLY LOOK AT

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.098
TOTAL COLLECTIONS BECAUSE THAT

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:54.399
COULD JUST SIMPLY BE TIED TO

00:28:54.466 --> 00:28:56.768
TOTAL -- INCREASING CASELOADS

00:28:56.835 --> 00:28:58.269
WHICH IS THE CASE THAT WE WILL

00:28:58.336 --> 00:28:59.104
ALSO WANTED TO IMPROVE.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:00.371
ON INDIVIDUAL CASES ARE

00:29:00.438 --> 00:29:03.108
INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES OUTCOMES AS

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:04.442
WELL AND SO BY LOOKING ABOVE.

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.478
THERE'S A FAIR BALANCE BETWEEN

00:29:06.544 --> 00:29:09.047
THOSE TWO METRICS ON THE OTHER

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:09.981
COMPONENT OF THE PERFORMANCES

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:12.417
AND OF FINDING IS THAT WE'RE

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:13.451
COMPARING ELSE JUST SAY TO

00:29:13.518 --> 00:29:14.319
THEMSELVES.

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.887
AND SO CALIFORNIA IS VERY

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:17.722
DIVERSE IN ITS DEMOGRAPHICS AND

00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:19.791
SUCH AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:20.725
PENALIZE CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:22.694
HAVE LESS AFFLUENT DEMOGRAPHICS

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:23.528
WHEN BEING COMPARED TO OTHERS

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:24.529
AND SO.

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:26.331
WIN A COUNTIES WHEN COMPARED TO

00:29:26.397 --> 00:29:31.402
THEMSELVES THIS KIND OF

00:29:31.469 --> 00:29:32.370
ESTABLISH ABOUT FAIRNESS AND

00:29:32.437 --> 00:29:34.939
THANK YOU.

00:29:35.006 --> 00:29:36.341
SIDE THIS S. SAY THERE'S THREE

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.075
MAJOR GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL

00:29:37.142 --> 00:29:38.877
ONCE REDUCING POVERTY IN THE

00:30:35.667 --> 00:30:36.534
SUPPORT PAYMENTS CAN ACCOUNT FOR

00:30:36.601 --> 00:30:37.835
UP 240%.

00:30:37.902 --> 00:30:39.370
OF A LOW INCOME RECIPIENTS

00:30:39.437 --> 00:30:41.139
HOUSEHOLD INCOME.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:42.607
WITH REGARD TO FIT FUNDING

00:30:42.674 --> 00:30:43.608
EQUITY THE LA -- REPORTEDLY

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:44.876
CORRECTLY REPORTS THERE'S A

00:30:44.943 --> 00:30:46.377
GREAT DISPARITY IN THE FUNDING

00:30:46.444 --> 00:30:47.111
ACROSS LOCAL CHANNELS FOR

00:30:47.178 --> 00:30:48.780
AGENCIES THE AVERAGE FUNDING FOR

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:49.747
CASE FOR THE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES

00:30:49.814 --> 00:30:51.182
IS FIVE HUNDRED ONE DOLLARS PER

00:30:51.249 --> 00:30:51.783
CASE.

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.418
COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE OF EIGHT

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:55.453
HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR PER CASE

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:56.454
FOR THE OTHER THIRTY COUNTIES

00:30:56.521 --> 00:30:58.189
STOPPING FUNDING EQUITY IS

00:30:58.256 --> 00:30:59.057
CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT THE

00:30:59.123 --> 00:31:00.391
CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM IS ABLE TO

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:01.359
PROVIDE.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.194
A CONSISTENT LEVEL OF SERVICE

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:04.495
STATEWIDE FOR CHILD SUPPORT

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:06.064
CUSTOMERS DESPITE GEOGRAPHIC AND

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.566
SOCIOECONOMIC DIFFERENCES ACROSS

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:09.901
THE STATE.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:11.369
SO WE ATTEMPTED TO TACKLE A LOT

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.371
OF THESE -- INSIDE THE PROPOSAL

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.539
THE DAN FIGHT ISSUES ONCE

00:31:14.606 --> 00:31:16.140
WITHOUT POVERTY AND AND SELF

00:31:16.207 --> 00:31:18.209
SUFFICIENCY AND THE OTHER WITH

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.044
EQUITY AND AND I I REALLY WANT

00:31:20.111 --> 00:31:21.312
EMPHASIZE WHY I'M CONCERNED THAT

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:23.615
WE SHOULDN'T AND CAN'T WAIT --

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:25.583
TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS PROPOSAL.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.184
THERE WERE TWENTY ONE COUNTIES

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.485
LAW FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR

00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:29.087
POSITIONS OF THE LAST SIX YEARS

00:31:29.153 --> 00:31:30.355
AND IF YOU GO BACK EVEN FURTHER

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:31.122
THAT'S AN EVEN MORE DRASTIC

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:31.689
NUMBER.

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.259
STAFFING REDUCTIONS OF 12% AS

00:31:34.325 --> 00:31:35.793
NOTED ABOVE THIS IS RESULTED IN

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:36.694
LOWER PROGRAM PERFORMANCE

00:31:36.761 --> 00:31:38.396
MEASURES DELIVERY OF SERVICING

00:31:38.463 --> 00:31:39.697
COLLECTIONS CUSTOMERS THE COST

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:40.798
OF WAITING IS THAT THE

00:31:40.865 --> 00:31:42.200
ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED FAMILIES

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.101
IN THESE COUNTIES.

00:31:43.167 --> 00:31:44.636
WILL CONTINUE TO BE UNDERSERVED

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:49.173
COMPARATIVE FAMILIES SERVE BY

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.343
ADEQUATELY FUNDED LCS ACE.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:53.311
EFFICIENCY IS A BIT OF A KEY

00:31:53.378 --> 00:31:54.178
DISCUSSION IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:31:54.245 --> 00:31:55.246
THE MOST SICK SIGNIFICANT

00:31:55.313 --> 00:31:55.913
EFFICIENCY WITH WE HAVE

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:56.648
IDENTIFIED IS THAT OF THE CALL

00:31:56.714 --> 00:31:58.182
CENTERS WHICH WE SPECIFICALLY

00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:59.817
CALLED OUT IN A PROPOSAL.

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.319
VIC SUCCESSFUL ENCOURAGE CELSIUS

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.153
IS TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR CALL

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.322
CENTERS TO REDUCE THE COST OF

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:05.356
RUNNING INDEPENDENT CALL CENTERS

00:32:05.423 --> 00:32:06.724
AN AERIAL CEASING TO PROPOSAL

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:08.126
MAKES CALL CENTERS EVEN MORE

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:09.527
EFFICIENT BY ESTABLISHING A SET

00:32:09.594 --> 00:32:12.330
RATIO. FOR CALLS PRIDGEN BASED

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:14.265
ON THOSE CALLS AND DRIVING AND

00:32:14.332 --> 00:32:15.800
DRIVING ESTIMATES SEVEN MILLION

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.468
OF FEATURES FOR THEIR SAVINGS

00:32:17.535 --> 00:32:19.037
COMPARED THE ACTUAL COSTS.

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.438
THE BULLS ARE RE DIRECTS THESE

00:32:20.505 --> 00:32:22.307
RESOURCES AN OFFSET THE OVERALL

00:32:22.373 --> 00:32:23.274
COST OF THE MUZZLE IN A CALL

00:32:23.341 --> 00:32:24.175
CENTER THAT FALLS BELOW THOSE

00:32:24.242 --> 00:32:25.810
BEST PRACTICE METRICS WE NEED TO

00:32:25.877 --> 00:32:27.111
REDUCE STAFFING AND STREAMLINE

00:32:27.178 --> 00:32:32.784
OPERATIONS OR FALL IN LINE WITH

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:33.951
THE RATIO.

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:34.485
I CAN REPORT THAT TO DATE

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:35.753
OUTSIDE THE CALL CENTER PROPOSAL

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:36.888
WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY FOR

00:32:36.954 --> 00:32:38.156
POLLS OR OR EFFICIENCIES THAT

00:32:38.222 --> 00:32:38.990
WOULD HAVE SAVED WOULD SAVE

00:32:39.057 --> 00:32:39.557
SIGNIFICANT COSTS.

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:40.792
IN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE TENS OF

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.727
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT THIS

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.095
RIPPLES IS TALKING ABOUT.

00:32:44.162 --> 00:32:44.629
WHEN IT COMES TO THE CASE

00:32:44.696 --> 00:32:45.663
WORKERS IN THE CASE RATIOS ARE

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:46.397
PROPOSAL?

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:47.598
THE RACES THAT WE PROPOSE OR

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.100
WHAT WE BELIEVE IS NECESSARY FOR

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:50.268
CASE WORKERS TO REACH OUT

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:52.437
PROACTIVELY. TO CUSTOMERS AND

00:32:52.503 --> 00:32:54.472
WORK WITH HIM CLARITY TO ACHIEVE

00:32:54.539 --> 00:32:56.741
POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN THE CASES

00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:57.542
AND OBTAIN FUNDING THIS SIR.

00:32:57.608 --> 00:32:59.410
SO IN ADDITION THAT WHEN WE'RE

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:00.645
TALKING ABOUT THE FINAL RULE AND

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:01.979
EVERYTHING IN THE FINAL RULE IS

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:03.348
TALKING ABOUT GETTING AWAY FROM

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:04.849
TECHNOLOGY IN INCREASING OUR

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.384
INVOLVEMENT ON A ON A CASE BY

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:10.288
CASE BASIS WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS.

00:33:10.355 --> 00:33:10.788
SINCE OUR IN THE BUDGET

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:11.356
METHODOLOGY IDENTIFIES AN

00:33:11.422 --> 00:33:12.323
APPROPRIATE LEVEL RESOURCES AND

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:13.725
STANDARD OF SERVICE FOR THE

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:14.592
FAMILIES.

00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.828
COUNTY IS CURRENTLY FUNDED ABOVE

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:17.795
THE TWENTY ONE AND FINING

00:33:17.862 --> 00:33:18.262
COUNTIES YIELD HIGHER

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.797
PERFORMANCE BRING IN THE LOWER

00:33:19.864 --> 00:33:20.531
TWENTY ONE FUNNY COUNTIES TO

PARITY IS EXPECTED TO YIELD

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:23.468
SIMILAR RESULTS.

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:24.602
REALLOCATING FUNDING FROM THE

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:25.803
OTHER COUNTIES COULD LEAD TO

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:27.472
STAFFING RATIOS -- REDUCTIONS IN

00:33:27.538 --> 00:33:28.740
THOSE COUNTIES WHICH WE THINK

00:33:28.806 --> 00:33:30.274
WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:30.908
OVERALL COLLECTIONS ACROSS THE

00:33:30.975 --> 00:33:31.542
STATE.

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.810
DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL SEEKS TO

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.445
CREATE EQUITY AMONGST ALL THE

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.580
COUNTIES WELL RESPECTED THE

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:36.881
FLEXIBILITY OF THE LOCALLY

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:40.051
OPERATED PROGRAMS TO RUN THE

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:42.420

00:33:42.487 --> 00:33:45.123
THANK QUESTIONS -- ALEJO.

00:33:45.189 --> 00:33:47.325
AS A THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED

00:33:47.392 --> 00:33:49.160
THERE HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:51.529
ISSUE WITH FUNDING WHEN IT COMES

00:33:51.596 --> 00:33:53.030
TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES

00:33:53.097 --> 00:33:54.699
IN THIS ISSUE DID COME UP LAST

00:33:54.766 --> 00:33:56.234
YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE SHARED

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.468
A SIMILAR CONCERN.

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.536
THAT THE CURRENT FUNDING

00:33:58.603 --> 00:33:59.871
METHODOLOGY ISN'T NECESSARILY

00:33:59.937 --> 00:34:02.306
BASED ON ANY POLICY RATIONALE OR

00:34:02.373 --> 00:34:04.909
ANY STATE OBJECTIVE -- DOES

FOLLOWING THOSE CONVERSATIONS

00:34:06.077 --> 00:34:08.846
THE LEGISLATURE DID PROVIDE AN

00:34:08.913 --> 00:34:10.715
AUGMENTATION TO FUNDING OF THREE

TWENTY NINETEEN OF THIS YEAR --

00:34:41.746 --> 00:34:43.581
WITH REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED NEW

BUDGETING METHODOLOGY OUR OFFICE

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:47.151
DID -- CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS AND

00:34:47.218 --> 00:34:48.753
ULTIMATELY WE FOUND THAT IT IS

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.322
PREMATURE AND RAISES A NUMBER OF

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.357
POLICY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS.

00:34:53.424 --> 00:34:55.126
THE PRE MATURITY OF THE PROPOSAL

00:34:55.193 --> 00:34:57.528
IS TWO PRONGED AS THE DEPARTMENT

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.764
MENTIONED -- WITHIN THE PAST FEW

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:01.365
YEARS WE DID RECEIVE FEDERAL

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:04.569
GUIDANCE BUT REALLY TASKS STATES

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:05.970
TOTE RELOOK AT TELL THEIR

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:07.972
PROGRAMS OPERATE -- FOR THE

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:10.541
PURPOSES OF ABILITY TO PAY

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.477
HAVING ORDERS -- REFLECT ABILITY

00:35:12.543 --> 00:35:14.111
TO PAY BUT ALSO THESE BROADER

00:35:14.178 --> 00:35:16.848
POLICY CONVERSATIONS AROUND --

00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:18.316
PRESUMED AND COME ARE HOW WE

00:35:18.382 --> 00:35:21.853
ESTABLISH ORDERS -- ARE ARE

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:22.954
PREMATURE AT THE END TO THE

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.889
EXTENT -- DEPENDING ON HOW WE

00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:26.691
APPROACH THOSE -- GUIDANCE THAT

00:35:26.757 --> 00:35:28.459
COULD AFFECT NOT ONLY SERVICE

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.361
DELIVERY BUT ALSO WORKLOAD IN

00:35:30.428 --> 00:35:31.429
ACROSS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:33.798
AGENCIES -- BUT THE MAIN GUY --

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.733
POINT OF FREE MATURITY REALLY

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.567
HAS TO DO WITH THIS MORE

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:38.402
IMMEDIATE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTED

00:35:38.469 --> 00:35:39.270
TO REALLY LOOK AT OPERATIONAL

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:41.539
EFFICIENCIES AND THE REASON WHY

00:35:41.606 --> 00:35:44.242
THAT MATTERS IS -- WERE FOR

00:35:44.308 --> 00:35:44.909
WHATEVER OPERATIONAL

00:35:44.976 --> 00:35:47.311
EFFICIENCIES ARE IDENTIFIED SOME

00:35:47.378 --> 00:35:49.013
OF WHICH I AM WE IDENTIFIED SOME

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.081
IN OUR REPORT.

00:35:50.147 --> 00:35:52.250
THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS NOT

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:54.318
ONLY ON HOW SERVICES ARE

00:35:54.385 --> 00:35:55.920
DELIVERED BUT ALSO THE

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:57.655
ASSOCIATED WORKLOAD ACROSS LOCAL

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:58.923
CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES WE COULD

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.124
SEE AN INCREASE IN WORKLOAD

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:01.692
RELATIVE TODAY OR DECREASE AND

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:03.928
WORKLOAD -- BUT UNTIL THAT WORK%

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:05.329
HAS BEEN DONE ND WE GET A

00:36:05.396 --> 00:36:07.265
BETTER SENSE OF THE NET IMPACT

00:36:07.331 --> 00:36:10.268
BUT IT WOULD HAVE ON THE PROGRAM --

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.036
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO THEN

00:36:12.103 --> 00:36:13.337
PROPOSE A NEW BUDGETING

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:15.273
METHODOLOGY AND ATTACHED WITH

00:36:15.339 --> 00:36:16.841
THE LEGISLATIVE REPORTING

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:18.042
REQUIREMENT WAS.

00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:19.844
ONCE WE IDENTIFY THE OPERATIONAL

00:36:19.911 --> 00:36:20.978
EFFICIENCIES WAS TO THEN

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:22.813
IDENTIFY BUDGET REFINEMENTS THAT

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.682
WOULD BE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.450
NET IMPACT THOSE WOULD HOP ON

00:36:26.517 --> 00:36:27.518
THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S SOMETHING

00:36:27.585 --> 00:36:28.185
THAT.

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:34.892
IS MISSING FROM THE PROPOSAL --

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:35.860
THE OTHER POINT SETTING THAT

00:36:35.927 --> 00:36:36.427
ASIDE THE PRE MATURITY THE

OF POLICY QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS

00:36:38.596 --> 00:36:40.831
SOME OF THEM RELATED -- TO THE

00:36:40.898 --> 00:36:41.966
ASSUMPTION THAT FUNDING WOULD

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.102
RESULT IN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE --

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:46.637
NOT ADDRESSING THE NURSES THE

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.906
TRADE OFFS -- ASSOCIATED WITH

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:51.609
LOOKING AT FINDING AMONGST THOSE

00:36:51.676 --> 00:36:52.610
ELSE -- LOCAL TRANSPORT AGENCIES

00:36:52.677 --> 00:36:54.211
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING

00:36:54.278 --> 00:36:55.947
MORE FUNDING THAN IS NEEDED TO

00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:57.582
OPERATE THE PROGRAM AND

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:59.317
EVALUATING -- WHAT A

00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:00.685
REALLOCATION WOULD LOOK LIKE IN

00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.119
THE TRADEOFFS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:04.021

INTO IN MORE DETAIL IF NEEDED --

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.228
BUT BECAUSE OF THE PRE MATURITY

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:12.597
IN THESE POLICY QUESTIONS OUR

00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:13.864
RECOMMENDATION WAS TO WITHHOLD

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:16.500
ACTION UNTIL MORE WORK IS DONE --

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.902
SPECIFICALLY ON ADDRESSING THE

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.270
LEGISLATIVE DIRECTIVE OF

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:21.072
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND

00:37:21.138 --> 00:37:22.707
THEN DETERMINING HOW DOES THAT

00:37:22.773 --> 00:37:23.841
AFFECT FUNDING LEVELS.

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.276
NOT ONLY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

00:37:25.343 --> 00:37:26.510
FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED BUT ALSO

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:28.179
THE ALLOCATION OF ABOUT FUNDING

00:37:28.245 --> 00:37:30.581
ACROSS ALL CSAA'S -- THE BUDGET

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.849
PROPOSALS MAINLY BASED OFF OF

00:37:31.916 --> 00:37:34.151
CURRENT PRACTICES BUT IN LIGHT

00:37:34.218 --> 00:37:35.653
OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ARE

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.321
EVER WE DID DECIDE TO APPROACH

00:37:37.388 --> 00:37:38.656
THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE.

00:37:38.723 --> 00:37:40.157
ON THAT COULD CHANGE THE

00:37:40.224 --> 00:37:41.726
OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM BUT

00:37:41.792 --> 00:37:43.227
THEN ALSO WHICH LC ESSAYS ARE

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:44.996
IDENTIFIED AS REQUIRING MORE

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:47.732
RESOURCES -- HOWEVER AGAIN WE

00:37:47.798 --> 00:37:49.133
DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CURRENT

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.769
FUNDING STRUCTURE IS OF CONCERN

00:37:51.836 --> 00:37:54.305

LEGISLATURE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT

00:37:57.141 --> 00:37:58.409
THIS YOU COULD TAKE A SIMILAR

00:37:58.476 --> 00:38:00.044
APPROACH OF PROVIDING STOP GAP

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.278

LEGISLATURE SPENDS ANOTHER SIXTY

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:05.055
MILLION BUCKS ON THE PROGRAM I

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.891
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT ALL WAYS

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:08.025
TO STREAMLINE.

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.460

YOU HAVE ALREADY OR DO YOU HAVE?

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:19.303
THAT WILL STREAMLINE OPERATIONAL

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.537
DEFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE THE

00:42:20.604 --> 00:42:23.307

WHAT KIND OF RECOMMENDATIONS WE

00:42:26.176 --> 00:42:28.579
MIGHT SEE IN THE CHART REPORT --

00:42:28.646 --> 00:42:30.180
I DID TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.916
THE EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE THAT

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:32.883
ARE IN THE WORKS OF THE THE

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.018
PRIMARY FISSIONS IF THEY WERE

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:35.286
ABLE TO FIND AT THE LOCAL

00:42:35.352 --> 00:42:36.320
CHANNELS FOR AGENCIES AS WITH

00:42:36.387 --> 00:42:37.254

THOSE WE'VE STARTED CONSOLIDATE.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.126
THOSE DOWN -- TO PRESERVATION

00:42:42.192 --> 00:42:44.094
SEES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S

00:42:44.161 --> 00:42:45.529
REALLY CASE MANAGEMENT AND SO

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.931
IT'S ABOT THE RATIO AND DYNAMIC

00:42:46.997 --> 00:42:48.766
OF THE NUMBER OF CASE WORKERS TO

00:42:48.832 --> 00:42:50.601

WITH THE NEED TO SHIP CASES TO

00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:12.856
OTHER PLACES BECAUSE WE JUST

00:43:12.923 --> 00:43:14.258
COULDN'T HANDLE -- TOUCHING

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:15.159
THOSE CASES AND THOSE OF THE

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.260
COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO BRING THEM

00:43:16.327 --> 00:43:17.594
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE COLLECTIONS

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:18.896
I CASES WE JUST COULDN'T GET TO

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:19.096
YOU.

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.297
SO WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO THE LINE

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:21.365
LEVEL IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE

00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.733
NUMBER OF BODIES WE HAVE WORKING

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:24.835
WITH THESE CONSTITUENTS TO HELP

00:43:24.902 --> 00:43:25.836
THEM GET BACK UP ON THEIR FATE

00:43:25.903 --> 00:43:27.237
FEE AND DELIVER THE COLLECTIONS.

00:43:27.304 --> 00:43:27.972
SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:43:28.038 --> 00:43:29.473
EFFICIENCY THE LOCAL WE HAVE NOT

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:30.975
IDENTIFIED ANY OTHER MAJOR

00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.242
EFFICIENCIES THAT ARE GONNA MAKE

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.411
UP DEFICIT LIKE THIS.

00:43:34.478 --> 00:43:35.045
AND THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:37.414
THIS PROPOSAL SO WOULD YOU --

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:41.218
OPINED THAT THE CASE LOADS FOR

00:43:41.285 --> 00:43:44.088
OUR OUR WONDERFUL CHAMPIONS IN

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:45.122
THE COUNTIES THAT ARE TRYING.

00:43:45.189 --> 00:43:46.390
TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIVES

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.392
HERE -- WOULD YOU SAY THE

00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.794
CASELOADS IN IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:43:50.861 --> 00:43:54.765
MUCH HIGHER FOR EACH -- EMPLOYEE

00:43:54.832 --> 00:43:57.167
THIS HELPING CAN IN COMPARISON

00:43:57.234 --> 00:43:58.736
TO OTHER STATES OF OUR OF OUR

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:01.472
SIZE TAXES -- NEW YORK.

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:02.439
I WOULDN'T SAY THE CASE THOSE

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.274
ARE NECESSARY HIGHER OR LOWER IT

00:44:04.341 --> 00:44:06.110
DEPENDS ON THE STAGE TALKING

00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.145
HAVE -- SOME COUNTIES THAT ARE --

00:44:08.212 --> 00:44:09.646
HIGHER AND COST EFFICIENCIES ARE

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:10.681
STATE RUN AND NOT LOCALLY

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.750
OPERATED AND THE VALUE OF HAVING

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:14.118
A LOCALLY OPERATED PROGRAM HERE

00:44:14.184 --> 00:44:15.986
IN CALIFORNIA IS THE TWO POINT

00:44:16.053 --> 00:44:17.254
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE HAND

00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.255
IN HAND -- CONNECTION THAT WE

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.990
HAVE IN IN THE CHALLENGES WE

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:24.061
ENGAGE IN AND TRYING -- TO

00:44:24.128 --> 00:44:24.628
TAILOR OUR SERVICES TO THE

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:26.263
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT RESPECTIVE

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:27.698
COUNTY -- SO THAT THAT'S A

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:28.799
DIFFERENT A FUNDAMENTAL

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.600
DIFFERENCE IN THE PROGRAM

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:30.467
ANOTHER FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.136
IN OUR STATE COMPARED TO OTHER

00:44:32.202 --> 00:44:33.537
STATES IS THAT JUDICIAL VERSES

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:36.206
ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH -- A WE

00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:37.341
HAVE A JUDICIAL BASE SYSTEM HERE

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:39.043
AND THEN INCREASES SOME OF THE

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.610
COSTS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE

00:44:39.676 --> 00:44:41.145
PROGRAM.

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.279
BUT THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTAL

00:44:42.346 --> 00:44:43.180
CALIFORNIA LIKE LEGISLATIVE

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.415
KINDS OF DISCUSSIONS AND NOT

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:47.451
EFFICIENCIES THAT WE CAN ADDRESS

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:49.486
AT THE LCS A LEVEL.

00:44:49.553 --> 00:44:50.521
AND THAT MAYBE YOU ARE THE LA --

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:51.188
AND ADDRESS THOSE JUDICIAL

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.756
VERSES ADMINISTRATIVE --

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:54.191
PATHWAYS IN ADMINISTERING THE

00:44:54.258 --> 00:44:56.660
PROGRAM THE THE BENEFITS OF ONE

00:44:56.727 --> 00:44:59.196
OVER THE OTHER ARE WE USING THE

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:01.432
WRONG THE WRONG METHOD

00:45:01.498 --> 00:45:03.200
METHODOLOGY HERE.

00:45:03.267 --> 00:45:05.035
BECAUSE IT WAS HE LIKE AND I I

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:06.703
THINK I SHARE THE LA OWES

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.838
CONCERNED CITIZENS DID DOESN'T

00:45:07.905 --> 00:45:09.673
SEEM TO BE A A CLEAR MARCHING

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:13.177
PLAN FORWARD TO ACCOMPLISH OUR

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:14.678
GOALS MAY BE CAN COMMENT ON THAT.

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:15.279
I THINK THE QUESTION YOU'RE

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:15.946
RAISING IN TERMS OF SHOULD THE

00:45:16.013 --> 00:45:17.014
STATE INCREASE THE USE OF

00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:18.949
ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES TO

00:45:19.016 --> 00:45:19.783
ESTABLISH OUR OPERATE THE

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:21.452
PROGRAM THAT'S ONE OF THE TYPE

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:22.920
OF OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:25.155
WE SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE.

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.990
FLAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.293
LOOK INTO -- FOR THEIR JULY

00:45:29.359 --> 00:45:33.330
FIRST REPORT -- IT DEFINITELY.

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:34.465
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.966
THERE ARE CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.168
PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING ONE

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:40.604
WAY IS -- A LOT OF L. C. ESSAYS

00:45:40.671 --> 00:45:43.574
ARE DOING UP FRONT WORK TO TRY --

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.075
TO ESTABLISH A PRE COURT

00:45:45.142 --> 00:45:46.510
AGREEMENT AMONGST CUSTODIAL

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.545
NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS IN THOSE

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:51.014
ARE CALLED STIPULATED ORDERS --

00:45:51.081 --> 00:45:53.417
THAT REDUCES THEN THE NEED OF

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:55.252
CUSTODIAL NONCUSTODIAL PARENTS

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:56.787
POTENTIALLY TO THEN BE INVOLVED

00:45:56.854 --> 00:45:59.189
IN THE JUDICIAL PROCESS -- AND

00:45:59.256 --> 00:46:01.291
IT COULD -- THEN POSSIBLY REDUCE

00:46:01.358 --> 00:46:02.759
THE NEED OF STAFF BEING INVOLVED

00:46:02.826 --> 00:46:03.961
IN THAT PROCESS THAT OPERATES

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.629
DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE AGAIN IT IT

00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:06.897
IS A RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:09.166
COURTS -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:12.102
THAT COULD BE EXPANDED -- IT

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.904
COULD BE EMPHASIZED IT IT DOES

00:46:13.971 --> 00:46:14.838
REQUIRE SOME FORM OF STATE

00:46:14.905 --> 00:46:16.240
LEADERSHIP BUT THAT'S A TYPE OF

00:46:16.306 --> 00:46:18.008
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY THAT WE

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.476
IDENTIFIED IN OUR REPORT.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:22.045
THAT -- IT'S A NEW WAY OR A NEW

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.347
WAY OF DOING THINGS POSSIBLY

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.983
STATEWIDE AND FOR AND MAYBE IN

00:46:26.049 --> 00:46:28.118
SOME LC ESSAYS -- BUT THEN

00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:31.021
UNDERSTANDING THAT NET COST OVER

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:32.356
THE NET CHANGING CURRENT

00:46:32.422 --> 00:46:34.324
OPERATIONS -- SOMETHING THAT

00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.126
HOPEFULLY THAT JULY FIRST REPORT

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.761
THAT TYPE OF LEVEL OF

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:39.930
OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES IS

00:46:39.997 --> 00:46:40.731
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:46:40.797 --> 00:46:41.565
MAY.

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:44.034
FLAG AS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:46.570
LOOKED INTO PROCEDURES SPONSORED

00:46:46.637 --> 00:46:51.074
I LOOK FOR TO GET IN THE JULY --

00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:55.512
REPORT THANK YOU.

00:46:55.579 --> 00:46:57.481
THANK YOU -- SO A FEW QUESTIONS

00:46:57.548 --> 00:46:59.116
AND SO FIRST OF ALL I I MEAN I I

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:02.452
I SIT HERE AND I AND I IS THAT

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.188
WELL BY MEMBER LAST YEAR.

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.689
I TOLD DEPARTMENT.

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.256
THEY SOLD THE DIRECTORS GET

00:47:06.323 --> 00:47:06.857
TOGETHER AND FIGURE THIS OUT

00:47:06.924 --> 00:47:07.691
BECAUSE WE HAD A TOTALLY

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:08.959
DYSFUNCTIONAL WAY OF

00:47:09.026 --> 00:47:10.761
DISTRIBUTING THE FUNDS WE HAD.

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.162
COUNTIES RICHMOND CENTER FUND

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.664
SURE THERE'S SOME COUNTIES DON'T

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:14.998
SAY THEY'RE OVER FUNDED BUT I

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:15.399
GET A BIT MORE.

00:47:15.465 --> 00:47:16.533
AND THEY SAID WE WE NEED TO

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.001
FIGURE THIS OUT -- AND IT'S BEEN

00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:20.571
GOING ON FOR WAY TOO LONG.

00:47:20.637 --> 00:47:22.873
SO AND I ACTUALLY FIRST OF ALL I

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.008
HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:26.310
ACTUALLY DOING WHAT.

00:47:26.376 --> 00:47:28.312
I WHAT I ASKED -- WHICH IS GET

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.380
TOGETHER FIGURE THIS OUT AND

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.482
LET'S TRY TO COME UP WITH A MORE

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:33.884
EQUITABLE WAY OF DOING THINGS

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.185
NOW IS THE PERFECT.

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:39.022
AND ART OF PERHAPS MORE

00:47:39.089 --> 00:47:42.159
INFORMATION WE NEED TO GET --

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.694
NOW I'M SURE IS CA MORE DATA

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.862
THEY'LL HELP REFINE FUTURE BUT I

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:46.797
I EIGHT AND AND AND I THINK THE

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:47.731
ONLY A RAISES SOME SOME GOOD

00:47:47.798 --> 00:47:49.499
QUESTIONS -- BUT BUT I DO HAVE

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.267
TO SAY IS THAT WHAT WILL -- I

00:47:50.334 --> 00:47:52.035
DON'T WANT TO DO IS LEAVE THE

00:47:52.102 --> 00:47:53.070
OLD SYSTEM IN PLACE.

00:47:53.136 --> 00:47:54.304
ALL RIGHT THAT'S BEEN AROUND HOW

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.540
HOW MANY YEARS NOW AND A GATES

00:47:56.607 --> 00:47:58.542
TWO DECADES RIGHT WHICH REALLY I

00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:59.409
MEAN.

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:00.811
SO SO AT REALIZE THERE MAY BE

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:02.613
SOME STILL SOME QUESTIONS HE

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:06.183
FIGURED OUT -- BUT AND FRANKLY I

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.317
WONDERED TO WHAT DEGREE IS OUR

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:08.952
QUOTE INEFFICIENCY RELATE TO THE

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:11.555
FACT THAT WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY --

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.923
WHAT PORTION OF OUR STATE

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.458
BECAUSE THE IF YOU HAD ALL THE

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:16.193
PEOPLE IN THAT IS COUNTY HIS

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:16.727
ALTOGETHER?

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.629
YEAH THAT 70% OF OUR CASELOAD

00:48:18.695 --> 00:48:19.997
RESIDES IN THESE TWENTY ONE

00:48:20.063 --> 00:48:21.798
CALIBRATE THE SO SO SO BASICALLY

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:25.502
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE HAVE.

00:48:25.569 --> 00:48:27.170
BECAUSE WE DO IT AND THERE'S

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.839
DIFFERENT REASONS WHY WE HAVE

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:29.706
COUNT YET WE HAVE WITH MR

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:30.407
THROUGH THE COUNTIES BUT

00:48:30.474 --> 00:48:31.041
BASICALLY HAVE A GOOD CHUNK OF

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:31.541
THE STATE.

00:48:31.608 --> 00:48:34.845
THAT IS UNDER FUNDED AND

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.880
THEREFORE NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:38.282
CERTAIN LEVELS EFFICIENCY OR

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:42.219
SCALE -- AND AND SO MAYBE THAT

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.220
THEY'LL IT WE WE THINK ABOUT

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:44.755
LIKE WHAT'S THE RETURN ON THE

00:48:44.821 --> 00:48:48.225
INVESTMENT -- THAT -- THAT WE

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:49.459
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.194
IMPROVE EFFICIENCY SIMPLY BY.

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.596
GETTING.

00:48:52.663 --> 00:48:54.498
EVERYONE -- NOT JUST PART OF THE

00:48:54.564 --> 00:48:56.500
STATE BUT THE ENTIRE STATE UP TO

00:48:56.566 --> 00:49:05.042
A TO TO TO A POINT WHERE WE CAN

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:07.177
ACTUALLY -- MORE EFFICIENTLY GET

00:49:07.244 --> 00:49:08.111
THE WORK DONE.

00:49:08.178 --> 00:49:09.046
I'M SURE THERE ARE PROCESSES WE

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:12.482
CAN IMPROVE AS WELL -- AND IN A

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:13.650
KNOW YOU'VE TALKED AND THAT'S

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:14.351
WHY I WANT YOU UP HERE BECAUSE I

00:49:14.418 --> 00:49:14.851
THINK THIS REALLY IS A

00:49:14.918 --> 00:49:15.452
COLLABORATION AND WE NEED TO

00:49:15.519 --> 00:49:16.386
TALK ABOUT HOW THIS COMES

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:16.887
TOGETHER.

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.355
SO AND WE DO THERE IS A REPORT

00:49:18.422 --> 00:49:20.190
THAT SHOULD BE COMING OUT AND

00:49:20.257 --> 00:49:23.460
AND I GUESS IT'S NOW APRIL RIGHT

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:24.461
SO MAY JUNE.

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:27.097
COUPLE COUPLE MONTHS -- AND NICE

00:49:27.164 --> 00:49:28.498
THAT AND I SENATOR AGENCIES

00:49:28.565 --> 00:49:29.166
PRODUCING THE REPORT.

MORE STUFF THEY DISCOVER THE

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.998
NEXT COUPLE MONTHS BUT WAS ALSO

00:50:02.065 --> 00:50:03.166
PART OF THE PROCESS AND HELPING

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:15.479
THAT.

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.414
SO I MADE A THINK.

00:50:17.481 --> 00:50:18.081
YOU KNOW I I AND I THINK THAT WE

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:19.249
NEED TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS

00:50:19.316 --> 00:50:20.350
THAT.

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:21.485
THAT YOU RAISING AT THE LA OWES

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:22.786
RAISING I THINK THERE'S

00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:23.687
ADJUSTMENTS WE NEED MAY

00:50:23.754 --> 00:50:25.355
EFFECTIVELY MOVED TO YELL OKAY

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:25.822
WE WANT THIS TO A MORE

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.391
ADMINISTRATIVE.

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.592
I'M NOT SURE HOW.

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:31.461
SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS --

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:31.962
EFFORTS THAT GO DOWN THE

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:33.263
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS HAVE

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:34.564
HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND THEY

00:50:34.631 --> 00:50:36.666
HAVE NOT GONE RIGHT SO IT MAY BE

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.702
REFRESHING LOOK AT THOSE MIGHT

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:40.337
AN OPTION BUT YEAH WELL I I

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:41.004
GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT I

00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.339
DON'T SEE YOUR PROPOSALS.

00:50:42.406 --> 00:50:42.939
PREVENTING THAT FROM US FROM

00:50:43.006 --> 00:50:44.307
DOING THAT THE FUTURE IF THAT

00:50:44.374 --> 00:50:45.642
TURNS OUT THAT'S WHERE WE WANT

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:46.877
TO GO AND OBVIOUSLY.

00:50:46.943 --> 00:50:48.311
THERE'S OTHER DISCUSSIONS THAT

00:50:48.378 --> 00:50:50.080
NEED TO HAPPEN SO SO I GUESS

00:50:50.147 --> 00:50:51.615
PART OF ME.

00:50:51.681 --> 00:50:53.283
IS SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE THE

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:54.618
SUGGESTION WHAT WE CAN DO IS WE

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.486
CAN JUST DO ANOTHER AUGMENTATION

00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.121
ADDED INSULATION ADJUSTER BUT

00:50:58.188 --> 00:50:59.923
NOT ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOMETHING

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.958
AT THIS POINT -- BUT WHAT I SEE

00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:04.428
HERE IS IS THAT.

00:51:04.494 --> 00:51:06.463
THINGS WERE SO BAD FOR TWO

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.098
DECADES.

00:51:08.165 --> 00:51:10.634
I I DON'T SEE HOW AND AND AND I

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:11.902
AND A GOOD TO GET THE IDEA THAT

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:16.006
OKAY WHAT HAPPENS NOW WE HAVE A

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.774
PROPOSAL THAT WERE OUT THERE.

00:51:17.841 --> 00:51:18.408
COUNTY AGENCIES WILL BE MAKING

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:19.042
CERTAIN DECISIONS BASED ON THE

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.477
MAKING CERTAIN HIRING DECISIONS

00:51:20.544 --> 00:51:21.678
CELLS ARE CERTAIN STAFFING

00:51:21.745 --> 00:51:25.816
DECISIONS BUT BUT I ALSO THINK

00:51:25.882 --> 00:51:27.117
THE PROPOSAL'S.

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.719
SEEM LIKE A AGAIN I HAVEN'T I'LL

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:31.488
WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE REPORT IS

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:32.489
NOW I THINK OUR FORM THAT I

00:51:32.556 --> 00:51:33.423
THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING

00:51:33.490 --> 00:51:35.425
ADJUSTMENTS TO THAT AND NOT THAT --

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:37.027
THE REPORT'S GONNA COME OUT AND

00:51:37.093 --> 00:51:39.396
WHOLESALE WOW THIS WHOLE

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.130
PROPOSAL.

00:51:40.197 --> 00:51:40.997
DOESN'T WORK AND WE HAVE TO

00:51:41.064 --> 00:51:42.432
REBUILD THIS THING FROM SCRATCH

00:51:42.499 --> 00:51:43.800
AGAIN.

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:49.606
IS -- SO I I JUST.

00:51:49.673 --> 00:51:50.607
THEN I'D THAT'S WHY LAST YEAR

00:51:50.674 --> 00:51:51.208

00:51:51.274 --> 00:51:52.409

00:51:52.476 --> 00:51:54.010
THE FACT THAT GOT TOGETHER YOU

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:54.978
FIGURED OUT YOU HERE BEFORE ME

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:55.579
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE FIGURED

00:51:55.645 --> 00:51:56.146
OUT TOGETHER.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:57.981
RIGHT AND WE HAD THAT YOU KNOW

00:51:58.048 --> 00:52:00.517
HOW THE CONVERSATION AND AND

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:01.952

00:52:14.397 --> 00:52:14.764
SAY.

00:52:14.831 --> 00:52:17.133
I THINK THE PAST SYSTEM IS MUCH

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:18.535
WORSE THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:22.005
HERE EVEN IF WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:52:22.072 --> 00:52:24.307
ADJUSTMENTS LATER ON THAT MAKES

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:24.841
SENSE.

00:52:24.908 --> 00:52:26.676
SO SO -- BUT I DO WANT I THINK

RIGHT NOW SO BUT IT YOU KNOW

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.288
WHATEVER HAPPENS IN THE FINAL

00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:43.793
BUDGET -- BUT I THAT --

00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:45.195
HOPEFULLY -- THAT'S NOT THE END

00:52:45.262 --> 00:52:45.829
OF THE STORY THAT'S NOT THE END

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:47.264

FOR LOW INCOME PARENTS MOST OF

00:58:53.496 --> 00:58:54.397
THEIR CHILD SUPPORT PAYMENTS GO

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:55.098
TO THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY BACK

00:58:55.164 --> 00:58:56.532
THE COST OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE.

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:58.735

INCARCERATION.

00:59:06.142 --> 00:59:07.043
THESE PENALTIES ARE

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:07.911
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.

00:59:07.977 --> 00:59:08.678
CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE

00:59:08.745 --> 00:59:09.846
COUNTRY'S MOST STRINGENT

00:59:09.913 --> 00:59:11.314
POLICIES.

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:12.048
YEAH WHEN PARENTS LOSE THEIR

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.016
LICENSES THEY CANNOT STRIVE TO

00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:13.950
WORK AND OFTEN LOSE THE ABILITY

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.251
TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT.

00:59:15.318 --> 00:59:16.386
BECAUSE DRIVERS LICENSE

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:16.920
SUSPENSION IS INEFFECTIVE

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:17.787
CALIFORNIA ELIMINATED THIS

00:59:17.854 --> 00:59:19.522
PRACTICE FOR FAILING TO PAY

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:20.890
TRAFFIC COURT DEBT.

TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT THAT EVEN

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:26.262
WHEN THAT DEBT IS OWED TO THE

00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:28.598
GOVERNMENT.

00:59:28.665 --> 00:59:29.265
WHEN COURSE RATED PARENTS' DEATH

00:59:32.802 --> 00:59:33.770
PERRANCE LEAVING JAIL WITH HIGH

00:59:33.836 --> 00:59:34.637
LEVELS OF DEBT ARE FAR MORE

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.039
LIKELY TO EXIT THE FORMAL

00:59:36.105 --> 00:59:38.174
ECONOMY NOT PAY CHILD SUPPORT

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:41.544
REDUCE CONTACT WITH THEIR

WE SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:43.279
INCARCERATION OF LICENSE

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:45.415
SUSPENSION INCREASES PAYMENT OF

00:59:45.481 --> 00:59:47.216

00:59:47.283 --> 00:59:48.685

CRAZY PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.032
WE WERE HOPING TO HAVE SOMEONE

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.267
IS DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.468
SYSTEM COME AND TELL YOU GUYS

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:08.838
ABOUT HOW IT AFFECTS THEM -- BUT

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.139
DID ALL KINDS OF STRUCTURAL

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:10.740
BARRIERS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.075
STOMACH CURRENTLY INCARCERATED

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.344
SUMMER EACH CAR SERRATED MEANING

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.044
THAT THEIR MOVEMENT IS

01:00:15.111 --> 01:00:16.012
RESTRICTED.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:18.314
BY A ANKLE MONITOR AND SOME WERE

01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.717
WORKING GRAVEYARD SHIFTS AND

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:22.318
COULDN'T MISS THEIR THEIR TIME

01:00:22.385 --> 01:00:23.619
THERE -- AND SO IN PREPARING FOR

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:24.454
THIS I TALK TO THEM ABOUT HOW

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:25.989
THIS AFFECTED THEIR LIVES AND

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:27.390
THE ISSUES THAT THEY WERE FACING

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.325
AND IN THAT CONCERNS FELL INTO

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.427
TWO MAIN BEAMS -- ONE BEING THAT

01:00:31.494 --> 01:00:32.462
THE CURRENT SYSTEM DIDN'T INVEST

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:33.596
INVEST ENOUGH IN FAMILY UNITY

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:35.264
AND THE OTHER THAT IT DIDN'T

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.333
INVEST ENOUGH IN PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.369
AND SO LIKE MY COLLEAGUE WAS

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.803
TALKING ABOUT.

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.905
I'M THESE SYSTEMS AT CREATE AN

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.374
ADVERSARIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.709
THE PARENTS THAT ONE NOW FEELS

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.644
LIKE THE OTHER HAS YOU KNOW SET

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.747
THE SENT THE DA AFTER THEM AND

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:51.647
AS IMPLIED THAT THERE THAT THE

01:00:51.714 --> 01:00:52.815
FATHER.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:53.549
OR THE OTHER ONE FEELS LIKE

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:54.250
THEY'RE IN BEING CALL THE

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:56.319
WELFARE QUEEN OR SOMETHING LIKE

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:57.620
THAT IN THE FALL INTO THESE

01:00:57.687 --> 01:00:59.322
RACES TRIPS AND AND HEARD THE

01:00:59.389 --> 01:01:00.423
FAMILY ALONG THE WAY.

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.624
AND IT'S ALWAYS THE RELATIONSHIP

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:03.426
WITH THE CHILD WHO NOW FEELS

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.660
LIKE THE FATHER'S NOT PROVIDING

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.062
EVEN IF HE'S PAYING INTO THE

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:14.137
SYSTEM THE CHILD OFTEN NEVER

01:01:14.203 --> 01:01:14.771
KNOWS THAT IN EVERY SEIZE ANY OF

01:01:14.837 --> 01:01:18.708
THAT MONEY -- FURTHER.

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.076
THE DISCORD BETWEEN THE PARENTS --

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:21.577
INCREASES THE CHANCES OF

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.012
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE REFUSE TO

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:24.313
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHICH IS A

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:27.550
HUGE ISSUE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY --

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:29.085
AND AS MY COLLEAGUE WAS ALSO

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.420
TALKING ABOUT DRIVER LICENSE

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:31.454
SUSPENSIONS THAT INCREASES THE

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.155
CHANCE OF PEOPLE DRIVING ON A

01:01:32.221 --> 01:01:33.222
SUSPENDED LICENSE BECAUSE THEY

01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.523
HAVE.

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:34.457
TO AND INCREASES THE CHANCE OF

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:35.324
POLICE CONTACT WHICH ALSO

01:01:35.391 --> 01:01:38.294
INCREASES THE CHANCE OF VIOLENCE --

01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:39.796
AND FINALLY IT PUSHES PEOPLE

01:01:39.862 --> 01:01:41.564
INTO BLACK MARKETS WHERE THEY

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:42.331
WON'T BE REACHED BY GARNISHMENT

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:43.366
AND BANK LEVY AND CAN ACTUALLY

01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:44.700
GIVE MORE MONEY TO THE CHILD AND

01:01:44.767 --> 01:01:47.203
THEY GET THROUGH THE SYSTEM --

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.139

WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO MOVE

01:31:23.044 --> 01:31:24.579
AWAY FROM THIS I CALLED BIG BANG

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:25.680

WAYS TO IMPROVE.

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:59.734
OUR CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO

01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:03.371
DELIVER MORE FASTER -- BUT WE'VE

01:34:03.437 --> 01:34:06.574
ALSO BEEN ABLE TO HAVE --

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.309
SEVERAL STATEWIDE RELEASES OF

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:10.978
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE CARE SYSTEM --

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:13.781

OF USER ACCESS AND PERMISSIONS

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.464
TO THE CARE SYSTEM -- WE

01:34:30.531 --> 01:34:31.932
IMPLEMENTED A FEATURE THAT WE

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:34.568
REFER TO A SNAPSHOT WHICH IS A

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.203
SEARCH CAPABILITY.

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.039
THAT -- LEVERAGES INFORMATION

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:40.141
FROM THE LEGACY SYSTEM AND MAKES

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:42.476
IT POSSIBLE FOR A WORKER TO SEE

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.311

AND THAT GIVES THE WORKER

01:35:07.034 --> 01:35:09.070
INFORMATION ABOUT THE FACILITIES

01:35:09.136 --> 01:35:12.039
AND HOMES AND A CAPACITY OF

AND THE LAST I WANTED TO MENTION

01:35:23.918 --> 01:35:25.853
THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED -- EIGHTH --

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.922
FEATURE THAT WE REFER TO AS CANS

01:35:27.988 --> 01:35:29.123
WHICH IS THE CHILD AND

INFORMATION AND TRY TO IMPROVE

01:36:52.339 --> 01:36:54.141
SOME FUNCTIONALITY -- SKEWS ME

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:56.944
EFFICIENCY AND USE OF THAT SO --

01:36:57.011 --> 01:36:59.280
OF THOSE OF THOSE ARE ALL --

01:36:59.346 --> 01:37:00.848
ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT -- WERE

CAPACITY AND AND CAPABILITY -- I

01:37:10.591 --> 01:37:12.860
THINK -- WE WANTED TO MENTION I

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:13.727
THINK AS A RESULT OF THE

01:37:13.794 --> 01:37:16.096
QUESTION THAT WE HAVE SPENT

01:37:16.163 --> 01:37:17.932
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

01:37:17.998 --> 01:37:19.266
TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS --

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.869
TO DATE ON THIS PROJECT AND THE

01:37:21.936 --> 01:37:25.472
BUDGET THAT'S REFLECTED IN THE

01:37:25.539 --> 01:37:28.142
NOTES HERE OR YOU KNOW PROVIDES

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:29.910

QUESTION TWO OR DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:36.050
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:37:36.116 --> 01:37:37.451
IN WHICH GOOD PROCEED WITH THE

01:37:37.518 --> 01:37:40.421
THE OF THE CHANGE PROCESS OKAY

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:43.691
GOOD -- YES IT'S TRUE LAST LAST

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:46.360
SUMMER -- OUR PARTNER FEDERAL

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:47.928
PARTNERS ADMINISTRATION CHILDREN

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:50.931
YOUTH AND FAMILIES A SEE WHY OFF --

01:37:50.998 --> 01:37:53.334
DID A SITE VISIT AND WE REPORT

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.169
TO THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS JUST

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:57.571
AS WE WORK WITH C. D. T. ON AN

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:59.707
ONGOING BASIS -- FOR THEIR HELP

01:37:59.773 --> 01:38:01.842
IN AND GUIDANCE THEY'RE MANAGING

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.177
ALL THE STATES ARE DOING THESE

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:05.179
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS AND SO

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:07.014
THEY HAVE SOME GOOD INSIDE --

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.582
AND THEY BRING SOME EXPERTISE

01:38:08.649 --> 01:38:10.517
THAT WAS WELCOMED -- BY US

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:12.920
INCLUDING HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:14.455
AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

01:38:14.521 --> 01:38:17.558
APPROACH AND AND ONE OF THE

01:38:17.625 --> 01:38:18.559
THINGS THAT THEY STRONGLY

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:19.727
RECOMMENDED WE WE SAY DIRECTED

01:38:19.793 --> 01:38:21.128
BUT IT WAS A WELCOME DIRECTION

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:23.264
AND THAT WAS -- INSTEAD OF

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:26.066
TRYING TO DO TOO MANY THINGS AT

01:38:26.133 --> 01:38:27.301
ONE TIME WHICH I THINK.

01:38:27.368 --> 01:38:29.003
IS STATE I TO PROJECTS ARE

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:30.738
COMPLEX AND THEIR LARGE AND WE

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:31.805
ALWAYS WANT TO GET THEM DONE

01:38:31.872 --> 01:38:33.807
QUICKLY AND SO I THINK IN SOME

01:38:33.874 --> 01:38:35.309
RESPECTS WE SAID.

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:37.011
LET'S HURRY UP AND GET

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:37.578
EVERYTHING DONE A WHILE THEY

01:38:37.645 --> 01:38:37.978
SAID.

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:39.480
DO ONE THING AT A TIME AND AND

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:42.182
GET THAT PRACTICE DOWN IN IN A

01:38:42.249 --> 01:38:44.184
REPEATABLE WAY ULTIMATELY TO GET

01:38:44.251 --> 01:38:45.819
TO THE POINT OF SCALING AND THAT

01:38:45.886 --> 01:38:46.754
THAT WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY WISE

01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:48.355
ADVICE AND WE TOOK IT TO HEART

01:38:48.422 --> 01:38:51.358
BECAUSE APPRECIATING THE THE THE

01:38:51.425 --> 01:38:54.728
VERY LARGE AND COMPLEX AND AND

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:55.829
AS AS A MATTER.

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:57.965
OF PRACTICE THE DYNAMIC NATURE

01:38:58.032 --> 01:39:00.034
OF CHILD WELFARE IT'S NOT A

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.503
LINEAR PROCESS CHILDREN.

01:39:02.569 --> 01:39:04.305
LIVE SIR -- CHANGING ALL THE

01:39:04.371 --> 01:39:05.973
TIME CONDITIONS ARE CHANGING ALL

01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:07.141
THE TIME AND YOU WANT YOUR

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:09.910
SYSTEM. TO BE SUFFICIENTLY

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:12.413
ADAPTIVE AND COMPLETE TO

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:13.814
ACCOMPLISH THAT SO.

01:39:13.881 --> 01:39:15.249
SO WE BEGAN TO REALIZE WE SHOULD

01:39:15.316 --> 01:39:17.584
WORK ON THAT ONE DIGITAL SERVICE

01:39:17.651 --> 01:39:18.919
AT A TIME GET THAT STRONG.

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:20.220
AND WELL DEVELOPED AND THEN

01:39:20.287 --> 01:39:21.889
BUILD ON THAT AND WORK TOWARDS

01:39:21.955 --> 01:39:23.557
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY.

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.693
IT'S ALSO -- DEVELOPING THE

01:39:25.759 --> 01:39:28.028
PRACTICE -- OUR OWN CAPABILITY

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:30.130
TO FOLLOW THESE PRACTICES WHILE.

01:39:30.197 --> 01:39:30.864
TOM.

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:33.167
THE OF THE ONE THING AT A TIME

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:34.902
APPROACH TO DOING THIS WE

01:39:34.968 --> 01:39:36.670
BELIEVE WILL ACTUALLY ACCELERATE

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:37.671
ULTIMATELY ACCELERATE OUR

01:39:37.738 --> 01:39:39.106
DELIVERY AND NOT TAKE LONGER

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.709
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAD FOUND IN THE

01:39:41.775 --> 01:39:43.744
FIRST -- TWO YEARS OF OUR EFFORT

01:39:43.811 --> 01:39:46.980
WAS THERE WAS CERTAINLY THE THE%

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:49.483
RISK OF HAVING DIFFERENT GROUPS

01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:51.018
DEVELOP THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND

01:39:51.085 --> 01:39:52.019
THEN WE END UP HAVING TO

01:39:52.086 --> 01:39:53.454
RECONCILE THEM LATER AND

01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.988
POTENTIALLY TO RE WORK SO IT

01:39:55.055 --> 01:39:57.825
MAKES MORE SENSE. TO FOCUS ON

01:39:57.891 --> 01:39:59.893
COMPONENTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:02.029
HOLISTIC AND AND GET THOSE DONE

01:40:02.096 --> 01:40:04.298
AND THEN LEVERAGE WHAT YOU DID

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:05.766
THERE FOR THE FUTURE THINGS SO

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.368
WE ACTUALLY WELCOME THAT

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:08.902
RECOMMENDATION WE THINK IT IS

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:11.438
THE RIGHT APPROACH -- FOR OUR

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.006
PROJECT AT THIS TIME.

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:14.274
OKAY THANK YOU A COMMENCEMENT

UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:20.681
ADMINISTRATION WILL BE

01:40:20.748 --> 01:40:22.316
SUBMITTING -- SPECIAL PROJECT

01:40:22.383 --> 01:40:23.650
REPORT TO ACTUALLY UPDATE THE

01:40:23.717 --> 01:40:25.285
BASELINE COST AND SCHEDULE FOR

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:26.787
THIS PROJECT AND SO IT'S OUR

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:29.690
INTENT TO ANALYZE AND PROVIDE --

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:31.158
OUR COMMENTS ON THAT ONCE IT'S

01:40:31.225 --> 01:40:33.026
AVAILABLE.

01:40:33.093 --> 01:40:35.295
OKAY THANK YOU FINANCE QUESTIONS.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.697
THEY TELL US WHAT TECHNOLOGY.

01:40:36.764 --> 01:40:39.199
OF JUST THAT AGAIN WE'VE BEEN --

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:40.734
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THIS PROJECT

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:41.735
THROUGH THIS JOURNEY THEY ARE

01:40:41.802 --> 01:40:43.470
THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT --

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.738
I'VE BEEN HERE.

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.273
A FEW OF THESE BUDGET CYCLES IN

01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:47.574
WHICH THIS WAS THE FIRST ONE

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.109
THAT WAS BLAZING THE TRAIL ON

01:40:49.176 --> 01:40:51.111
TRAIN NEW METHODOLOGIES SO.

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:52.446

YOUR YOUR SPOTS BECAUSE I THINK

01:41:58.078 --> 01:41:59.513
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CAME UP

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.048
BEFORE AND I I SUPPORT THE EDGE

01:42:01.114 --> 01:42:02.349
OUTRAGE.

01:42:02.416 --> 01:42:04.218
BUT IT ALSO I THINK CREATED SOME

01:42:04.284 --> 01:42:05.886
NEW CHALLENGES FOR OVERSIGHT

01:42:05.953 --> 01:42:06.887
RIGHT.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.188
AND SO I LIKE IT'S MY QUESTIONS

01:42:08.255 --> 01:42:11.158
THE A -- IS BECAUSE LAST TIME

USE TO EVOLVING OUR PROCESSES IN

01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:21.034
A WAY A TWO TO TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:42:21.101 --> 01:42:22.636
WE NEED TO THE APPROPRIATE

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.738
OVERSIGHT AND AND AN AGILE

01:42:24.805 --> 01:42:26.273

ALLOWING -- THIS THIS -- PROCESS

01:42:35.983 --> 01:42:37.184
TO MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK

01:42:37.251 --> 01:42:38.886
THIS IS THE PRICE WE SHOULD

01:42:38.952 --> 01:42:40.087
TAKEN IT IN MY OPINION.

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:42.322

THINK WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:52.833
TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW BEST TO

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:54.501

SUBCOMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:30.003
REQUESTS THAT RANGES FROM

01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:31.137
SOMETIMES AS LOW AS HUNDREDS OF

01:48:31.204 --> 01:48:32.839
THOUSANDS AND AND TELL THE

01:48:32.906 --> 01:48:34.307
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS.

AND SO WE SAY OKAY WELL WE'RE

01:48:38.812 --> 01:48:40.213
GOING TO GIVE. THIRTEEN MILLION

01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.381

TO PEOPLE TO USE THE SYSTEM.

01:48:54.027 --> 01:48:55.295
I THINK OUR BIGGEST FAILURES ARE

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.530
ONES WHERE SOMEONE SAID I'M

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:59.466
GONNA HIRE A SOMEONE TO DO A

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:01.001
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTION BUT NOT

TALKING TO PEOPLE USING IT I'D I

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.104
THINK I KNOW WHAT THEY WANT.

AND YOU WONDER WHY DOESN'T WORK --

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.280

BUT I THINK WE WE DO NEED TO

01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:27.193
THINK ABOUT HOW -- WE GET THIS

01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:28.495
ACCOUNTABILITY PIECE HOW SO AS

01:49:28.561 --> 01:49:29.095

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:33.333
THAT HOW HOW HOW TO BE SURE THAT

01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:36.336
WE DO HAVE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT --

01:49:36.403 --> 01:49:38.705
ACCOUNTABILITY IN ITS IT AND AND

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:42.475

SO OKAY NOW WE DECIDED TO USE

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:53.520
THIS BUT IS IS THE COST

01:49:53.586 --> 01:49:54.287

THERE'S MORE OPPORTUNITIES WITH

01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:36.029

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:15.635
BASIS IT'S OKAY WE WE PUT CAN

SUBCOMMITTEE LAST TIME I WAS

01:56:27.313 --> 01:56:29.215
SO ON THE COUNCIL'S PROJECT HAS

01:56:29.282 --> 01:56:30.817
STARTED WE RECEIVED ALL OF OUR

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:32.418
FEDERAL APPROVALS IN FEBRUARY

01:56:32.485 --> 01:56:34.487
AND THE PROJECT KICKED OFF ON

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:36.189
MARCH THE FOURTH OF THIS YEAR.

01:56:36.255 --> 01:56:37.924
SO WE HAD AN EARLIER STRATEGY

01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:39.092
MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT WHERE WE

01:56:39.158 --> 01:56:40.693
WERE GOING TO MOVE FROM THREE

01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:42.495
SYSTEMS TO TO SYSTEMS AND THEN

01:56:42.562 --> 01:56:44.597
EVALUATE THE SINGLE SYSTEM.

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:46.065
AND THAT WAS THE LRC FOR

01:56:46.132 --> 01:56:47.433
MIGRATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.001
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS OVER A YEAR

01:56:49.068 --> 01:56:50.069
AGO SAID WELL WE'D LIKE YOU TO

01:56:50.136 --> 01:56:51.871
PULL MORE TIME INTO PLANNING AND

01:56:51.938 --> 01:56:52.939
COME UP WITH THAT.

01:56:53.005 --> 01:56:55.108
FULL SINGLE SYSTEM STRATEGY SO

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:56.242
AS YOU KNOW LAST YEAR WHEN WE

01:56:56.309 --> 01:56:57.543
WERE HERE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:56:57.610 --> 01:56:58.678
THAT PLANNING EFFORT.

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:01.347
PLANNING EFFORT WAS COMPLETED IN.

01:57:01.414 --> 01:57:03.750
DECEMBER AND WE SENT FORWARD ARE

01:57:03.816 --> 01:57:05.818
FEDERAL APPROVALS SO I HAVE

01:57:05.885 --> 01:57:07.553
PROVIDED A HANDOUT THAT SHOWS

01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:09.989
OUR ROAD MAP FOR CAL SONGS THAT

01:57:10.056 --> 01:57:11.424
ALL SPEAK TO TO SORT OF TELL

01:57:11.491 --> 01:57:13.826
WHAT THOUGHT APPROACHES.

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.461
<u>ND WHERE WE ARE. TO THE VERY</u>

01:57:15.528 --> 01:57:16.562
TOP LINE SHOWS THAT GOVERNMENT

01:57:16.629 --> 01:57:19.699
STRUCTURE -- THAT WE'VE TALKED

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:21.134
ABOUT THERE WILL BE A FIFTY

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:21.768
EIGHT COUNTY GOVERNMENT

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:23.302
STRUCTURE A GPA AND IT IS

01:57:23.369 --> 01:57:26.172
SCHEDULED TO BE IN PLACE BY JUNE.

01:57:26.239 --> 01:57:28.341
OF THE SUMMER.

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:30.076
AND THEN THE SECOND LINE ON THIS

01:57:30.143 --> 01:57:32.044
IS THE ACTUAL DESIGN DEVELOPMENT

01:57:32.111 --> 01:57:34.814
CONVERSION IMPLEMENTATION LINE.

01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:37.049
SO THIS IS WHAT OUR OUR FEDERAL

01:57:37.116 --> 01:57:38.117
PARTNERS ALSO WERE CLEAR THAT

01:57:38.184 --> 01:57:39.519
THEY WANTED US TO LEVERAGE

01:57:39.585 --> 01:57:41.654
EXISTING TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS

01:57:41.721 --> 01:57:42.922
THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE.

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:45.958
SO LRS WILL BE THE BASE SYSTEM

01:57:46.025 --> 01:57:47.727
FOR CAL SAWS IT'S NOT A NEW

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:50.129
BUILD IT STARTED TO SYSTEM THE

01:57:50.196 --> 01:57:51.531
ALERT SYSTEM WILL BE MODIFIED.

01:57:51.597 --> 01:57:53.266
SO VERY FIRST STEP IN THAT THE

01:57:53.332 --> 01:57:55.201
FIRST TRIANGLE IS THAT THERE'S A

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:57.069
NEW HOSTING STRATEGY AND OTHER

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:58.237
US WILL BE MOVED FROM AN ON

01:57:58.304 --> 01:57:59.772
PREMISES DATA CENTER INTO THE

01:57:59.839 --> 01:58:00.907
CLOUD.

01:58:00.973 --> 01:58:02.475
AND THEN AFTER THAT THERE WILL

01:58:02.542 --> 01:58:04.677
BE SEVEN RELEASES OF

01:58:04.744 --> 01:58:06.946
MODIFICATIONS INTO LRS THAT WILL

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:09.315
TRANSFORM IT INTO THE CAL SAWS.

01:58:09.382 --> 01:58:12.452
APPLICATION THAT MEETS THE NEEDS

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:13.052
OF ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES.

01:58:13.119 --> 01:58:14.720
AND THEN THE NEXT STEP IS THAT

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:17.957
THE THIRTY NINE COUNTIES THIRTY

01:58:18.024 --> 01:58:19.392
NINE C. FOR COUNTIES WILL GO

01:58:19.459 --> 01:58:24.430
LIVE.

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:26.432
ONE AND THEN AFTER THAT WILL

01:58:26.499 --> 01:58:28.301
BEGIN THE CAL NGUYEN.

01:58:28.367 --> 01:58:30.002
EMPLOYMENT TATIAN BEGINNING IN

01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:31.571
JANUARY TWENTY TWO AND THAT WILL

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:33.439
BE A MORE WAVED IMPLEMENTATION

01:58:33.506 --> 01:58:35.475
IT HAS A DIFFERENT DATA

01:58:35.541 --> 01:58:38.044
STRUCTURE ODDS MORE CHANGE FOR

01:58:38.110 --> 01:58:39.812
THE COW WHEN COUNTIES THAN IT IS

01:58:39.879 --> 01:58:42.782
FOR THE SEE FOR COUNTIES.

01:58:42.849 --> 01:58:44.951
SO THEN IT WILL BE COMPLETE IN

01:58:45.017 --> 01:58:47.854
JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE

01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:49.655
WELL IN ADVANCE -- OF OUR

01:58:49.722 --> 01:58:51.357

TWELFTH DECEMBER.

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:55.194
TWENTY TWENTY THREE THE OTHER

01:58:55.261 --> 01:58:56.028
LINES ON THE ROAD MAP REALLY

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:57.563
JUST REFLECT OTHER PROCUREMENTS

01:58:57.630 --> 01:58:59.098
THAT WILL BE MADE TO SUPPORT.

01:58:59.165 --> 01:59:00.500

WE DO HAVE AN OVERALL BUDGET

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:11.511
THAT WAS APPROVED BUT THERE WILL

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:12.512

MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS THAT NEED

01:59:17.650 --> 01:59:20.286

TRANSFORM CAL FRESH WE ARE A

02:00:31.991 --> 02:00:33.526
GROUP OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

02:00:33.593 --> 02:00:34.594
THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WHO

02:00:34.660 --> 02:00:36.195
ADVOCATE ON BEHALF.

02:00:36.262 --> 02:00:37.863
OF OF PEOPLE WHO NEED AND USE

02:00:37.930 --> 02:00:40.299
CAL FRESHEN ALSO TO RAISE OUR

02:00:40.366 --> 02:00:41.934
CAL FRESH PARTICIPATION RATES

02:00:42.001 --> 02:00:42.768
I'M IN A EARLIER WE'RE TALKING

02:00:42.835 --> 02:00:44.370
ABOUT COST EFFECTIVENESS AND

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:46.305
WHILE THE SAW SYSTEM SERVES MANY

02:00:46.372 --> 02:00:48.240
MORE PROGRAMS AND JUST HOW FRESH --

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:49.942
WITHIN CAL FRESH WE PAY THE MOST

02:00:50.009 --> 02:00:51.110
AND WE DON'T GET THE GREATEST

02:00:51.177 --> 02:00:54.914
RESULTS -- JUST IN JANUARY

02:00:54.981 --> 02:00:56.082
20001963% OF ALL CALIBRATION

02:00:56.148 --> 02:00:57.817
AISLES WERE FOR PROCEDURAL

02:00:57.883 --> 02:00:59.352
REASONS NOT REASONS OF

02:00:59.418 --> 02:01:00.653
INELIGIBILITY.

02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:01.988
AND SO CAL FRESH AND THESE OTHER

02:01:02.054 --> 02:01:03.589
STATE WHY PROGRAMS RELY REALLY

02:01:03.656 --> 02:01:05.091
HEAVILY ON AUTOMATION TO DELIVER

02:01:05.157 --> 02:01:06.692
SERVICES AND WE NEED AN

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:08.060
EFFECTIVE SAWS IN ORDER TO BE

02:01:08.127 --> 02:01:09.829
ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE SERVICES

02:01:09.895 --> 02:01:10.763
TO PEOPLE.

02:01:10.830 --> 02:01:11.530
AND IF YOU WANT TO BE CLEAR SOME

02:01:11.597 --> 02:01:12.498
OF YOUR EARLIER POINTS WERE

02:01:12.565 --> 02:01:14.166
TALKING ABOUT THE USERS WE

02:01:14.233 --> 02:01:15.401
REALLY CARE ABOUT AUTOMATION

02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:16.769
BECAUSE WE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE --

02:01:16.836 --> 02:01:18.337
I'VE BEEN A RECIPIENT OF THESE

02:01:18.404 --> 02:01:19.872
PROGRAMS MYSELF I KNOW WHAT IT

02:01:19.939 --> 02:01:21.307
FEELS LIKE TO BE ON THE END OF

02:01:21.374 --> 02:01:22.642
THAT PHONE AND FEEL REALLY

02:01:22.708 --> 02:01:24.143
DESPERATE AND SEEKING NEED --

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:25.044
AND SO WHEN I FIGHT FOR CAL

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.212
FRESH IS BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S

02:01:26.278 --> 02:01:27.380
REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE CARE

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:29.115
ABOUT AUTOMATION BECAUSE WE CARE

02:01:29.181 --> 02:01:31.450
ABOUT THAT HUMAN INTERACTION.

02:01:31.517 --> 02:01:32.118
AND YOU PROBABLY KNOW FROM BEING

02:01:32.184 --> 02:01:33.452
A DOCTOR BUT WHEN YOU INTRODUCE

02:01:33.519 --> 02:01:35.721
EMR AS AN SYSTEMS LIKE EPIC IT

02:01:35.788 --> 02:01:36.322
CAN REALLY CHANGE THAT HUMAN

02:01:36.389 --> 02:01:37.523
DYNAMIC AND WE'RE REALLY

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:38.591
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT HUMAN

02:01:38.658 --> 02:01:40.860
DYNAMIC AND WHAT WORKERS GRIPS.

02:01:40.926 --> 02:01:43.195
AN OPTIONS MIGHT MEAN FOR FOR

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:44.964
CLIENTS ACCESS -- AND SO AS A

02:01:45.031 --> 02:01:46.198
NEW GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZING

02:01:46.265 --> 02:01:47.733
TECHNOLOGY AND WE'RE TALKING

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:49.168
ABOUT ACES AND TRAUMA AND

02:01:49.235 --> 02:01:50.903
BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE WE WANT TO

02:01:50.970 --> 02:01:52.571
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SAWS

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:54.273
THAT FACILITATES THAT AS WELL --

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:55.241
BECAUSE WE KNOW WHEN PEOPLE COME

02:01:55.307 --> 02:01:56.776
TO THESE ONLINE PORTALS OR MEET

02:01:56.842 --> 02:01:57.543
WITH WORKERS THEY'RE

02:01:57.610 --> 02:02:00.046
EXPERIENCING A LOT OF TRAUMA AND

02:02:00.112 --> 02:02:00.680
THE NEW SYSTEM THAT SERVES THEM

02:02:00.746 --> 02:02:01.113
WELL.

02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:02.281
AND SO WE'VE BEEN AN ACTIVE

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:03.416
PARTICIPANT IN THE STAKEHOLDER

02:02:03.482 --> 02:02:04.650
GROUP THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THE

02:02:04.717 --> 02:02:07.186
TRAILER BILL LAST YEAR WE REALLY

02:02:07.253 --> 02:02:07.820
APPRECIATE THAT.

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:08.688
I'M A THERE'D BEEN SOME REALLY

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:09.855
POSITIVE OPENINGS IN THE LAST

02:02:09.922 --> 02:02:11.590
FEW WEEKS TO SOLIDIFY THE

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.192
COMMITMENT TO MEET REGULARLY TO

02:02:13.259 --> 02:02:15.394
OPEN TRANSPARENCY AND WE EXPECT

02:02:15.461 --> 02:02:17.129
THAT COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE --

02:02:17.196 --> 02:02:23.169
AND WE ALSO JUST REALLY WANT TO

02:02:23.235 --> 02:02:23.769
MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CARE ABOUT

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:24.837
THE PROCESS AND PARTICIPATION

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:25.805
FOR THE OUTCOMES WE DON'T WANT

02:02:25.871 --> 02:02:26.706
IT TO BE LIKE A CHECK BOX OF

02:02:26.772 --> 02:02:27.873
QUARTERLY MEETINGS ARE WE HAD A

02:02:27.940 --> 02:02:28.541
MEETING AND WE SAT THERE AND WE

02:02:28.607 --> 02:02:29.442
REVIEWED AN AGENDA WE WANTED TO

02:02:29.508 --> 02:02:29.709
ACTUALLY.

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:30.309
TRANSFORM THE SYSTEM BECAUSE

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:31.777
UNFORTUNATELY UNTIL NOW THE

02:02:31.844 --> 02:02:33.045
TECHNOLOGY HAS OFTEN BEEN A

02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:35.147
BARRIER NOT A FACILITATOR OF

02:02:35.214 --> 02:02:36.248
ACCESS AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

02:02:36.315 --> 02:02:37.550
AS WE BUILD A SYSTEM FOR THE

02:02:37.616 --> 02:02:38.684
FUTURE THAT IT'S REALLY

02:02:38.751 --> 02:02:40.853
FACILITATING NOT -- AND SO TO

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:42.388
THAT END WE REQUEST TRAILER BILL

02:02:42.455 --> 02:02:43.589
THAT WILL ESTABLISH THAT THE

02:02:43.656 --> 02:02:45.257
NEEDS OF CLIENTS AND APPLICANTS

02:02:45.324 --> 02:02:46.826
FOR A SYSTEM THAT MINIMIZES THE

02:02:46.892 --> 02:02:48.794
BURDEN OF THE OVERALL PROCESS TO

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:50.162
ACTUALLY GET ROLLED NOT JUST AN

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:51.864
APPLICATION OR RE CERTIFICATION

02:02:51.931 --> 02:02:53.299
BUT THE WHOLE PROCESS.

02:02:53.365 --> 02:02:54.066
THAT THAT WOULD BE HE NORTH

02:02:54.133 --> 02:02:55.735
STAR OF THE WHOLE PROJECT

02:02:55.801 --> 02:02:57.837
DEVELOPMENT AND SO WHILE THERE'S

02:02:57.903 --> 02:02:58.671
THIRTY TWO WORK GROUPS AND

02:02:58.738 --> 02:03:00.005
MONTHLY MEETINGS AND QUARTERLY

02:03:00.072 --> 02:03:01.507
MEETINGS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IF

02:03:01.574 --> 02:03:03.342
WE ARE NOT THERE IN A ROOM TO

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:04.877
CONSULT THE DECISION OR THERE'S

02:03:04.944 --> 02:03:06.479
A TECHNOLOGY BEING CHOSEN.

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:07.546
THAT THAT WOULD BE THE GUIDING

02:03:07.613 --> 02:03:09.148
QUESTION IS THIS GOING TO

02:03:09.215 --> 02:03:10.916
MINIMIZE THE BURDEN FOR CLIENTS --

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:11.851
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT COUNTY

02:03:11.917 --> 02:03:13.452
WORKERS AN ELIGIBILITY WORKERS

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:15.421
ARE USERS OF THE SYSTEM WE WANT

02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:17.156
THE SYSTEM TO WORK WELL FOR THEM

02:03:17.223 --> 02:03:19.158
AND TO BE INTUITIVE -- BUT THE

02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:20.960
REAL END USER IS THE PERSON WHO

02:03:21.026 --> 02:03:22.261
EITHER GETS BENEFITS OR NOT.

02:03:22.328 --> 02:03:23.596
AND SO IF AN AUTOMATED QUESTION

02:03:23.662 --> 02:03:25.064
THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE MEANS

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:26.532
THAT THIRTY DAYS LETTER THIRTY

02:03:26.599 --> 02:03:27.800
DAYS LATER YOU GET A LETTER THAT

02:03:27.867 --> 02:03:29.135
YOU LOST YOUR MEDICARE ALL.

02:03:29.201 --> 02:03:30.803
THAT'S THE REAL TRAGEDY AND SO

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:31.804
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:03:31.871 --> 02:03:32.838
BUILDING A SYSTEM THAT CAN BE

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:34.707
FIXED THAT CAN BE ENTERED OF

02:03:34.774 --> 02:03:35.975
THAT CAN RESPOND TO CLIENT

02:03:36.041 --> 02:03:37.309
FEEDBACK IN A CORPORATION THAT A

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:37.877
THROUGH.

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:41.514
DEVELOPMENT PLANNING AND

02:03:41.580 --> 02:03:42.481
IMPLEMENTATION [inaudible]

02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:45.484
THANK YOU.

THREE TIMES FOR THE SAME CHANGE

02:04:04.470 --> 02:04:04.703

STORE CLEAN -- THESE WE WE'VE

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:10.109
SEEN MANY DIFFERENT COMPUTER

02:04:10.176 --> 02:04:11.544
SYSTEMS COMMON GOAL.

IN MOST OF THE TIMES THE

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.314
MIGRATION THE START UPS HAVE

02:04:15.381 --> 02:04:16.782
BEEN A NIGHTMARE. FOR PUBLIC

02:04:16.849 --> 02:04:19.251
BENEFITS FISHERIES.

02:04:19.318 --> 02:04:21.487
THE SYSTEM IS NOT PROFESSIONALLY

02:04:21.554 --> 02:04:23.155
TESTED.

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:26.125
BEFORE IT GOES LIVE WORKERS ARE

02:04:26.192 --> 02:04:27.459
NOT INDEPENDENTLY.

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:30.396
VERIFIED THAT THEY'VE BEEN

02:04:30.462 --> 02:04:32.264
TRAINED PROPERLY.

02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:35.668
THE FISH WE SUFFER HOMELESSNESS.

02:04:35.734 --> 02:04:36.435

ABOUT TEN YEARS IN THE PREVIOUS

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:41.073
CENTURY I THINK OR MAYBE TEN

02:04:41.140 --> 02:04:42.107
FIFTEEN YEARS AGO.

02:04:42.174 --> 02:04:44.743

AND I WAS DOING TO MOCK

02:04:48.013 --> 02:04:49.348
INTERVIEW AND THERE WAS A WORKER.

THEY WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:52.351
AND THEY COULD NOT.

02:04:52.418 --> 02:04:53.886
PROCESS THE CASE WHAT THE

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:57.423
WORKING.

02:04:57.489 --> 02:04:59.358

COMPUTER SYSTEMS NOBODY KNOWS

02:05:01.894 --> 02:05:03.529
ABOUT IT?

02:05:03.596 --> 02:05:04.430
IT ALL HAPPENED JUST PURE.

02:05:04.496 --> 02:05:08.334
IT'S PERFECT NOTHING HAPPENS WHY.

02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:10.135

CALIFORNICA WOMEN TO UNITE SO

02:05:54.546 --> 02:05:59.585
IT'S GONNA BE THE GONNA REPEAT

02:05:59.652 --> 02:06:00.753
THE WHOLE THING AGAIN.

THE LEGISLATION.

02:06:03.355 --> 02:06:03.856
TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE COULD --

IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE WITH WITH A

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:14.233
CHALLENGE.

REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TH

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:46.738
CONCERNS THAT YOU PHRASE THE IF

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:49.041
THE EXISTING SYSTEMS I MEAN THE

02:10:49.107 --> 02:10:49.641
THIS IS.

02:10:49.708 --> 02:10:52.444
MAINLY A PEOPLE PERSON ISSUE THE

02:10:52.511 --> 02:10:54.112

TELL YOU HEARING THAT.

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.517
SOME SYSTEMS WORK BETTER THAN

OTHERS IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:04.323
VERSUS THE PERSON IS ACTUALLY

PHASE IT'S NOT THIS.

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:15.734
OKAY THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:17.569
WORK WITH A SORT OF BEEN TRAINED

02:11:17.636 --> 02:11:18.870

ROOM.

02:11:19.738 --> 02:11:21.974
AND A GIVEN A LITTLE SPEECH AND

02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:23.475
THEN THIS A GOLD WORK.

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.677

KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:32.684
OTHERWISE YOU'RE GONNA LOSE

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:33.852
MONEY AND THEY SHOULD ADOPT THE

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:36.822
SAME TYPE OF PROCESS IS TO MAKE

02:11:36.888 --> 02:11:37.689
SURE THAT WHOEVER'S ON THE

02:11:37.756 --> 02:11:38.557
TERMINAL.

02:11:38.624 --> 02:11:40.325
KNOWS WITH WHAT THEY'RE DOING

02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:48.233
AND THEIR MAKES MISTAKES THE MAN.

02:11:48.300 --> 02:11:49.868
FOR THE FIRST YOUTH IT'S CHAOS I

02:11:49.935 --> 02:11:52.137
MEAN I'M SORRY OKAY SO.

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:54.973
AND AND AND THEN -- AND SO I

02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:55.774
REALLY FOR DANGER TAKING

02:11:55.841 --> 02:11:57.976
SEXUALLY THREE SYSTEMS AND

02:11:58.043 --> 02:11:58.744
TRYING.

02:11:58.810 --> 02:11:59.378

TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AROUND

02:12:00.712 --> 02:12:01.747
ONE SYSTEM AND WE JUST HAD THIS

02:12:01.813 --> 02:12:02.414
WHOLE CONVERSATION ABOUT ANOTHER

02:12:02.481 --> 02:12:03.315

02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:04.316
AND SO FORTH I MEAN.

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:06.118
IS THE WAY WERE PLANNING THIS

02:12:06.184 --> 02:12:07.352
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE WE ARE SIR

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:08.620
TAKING PEOPLE FROM THREE

EXISTING ARCHITECTURES AND

02:12:11.590 --> 02:12:12.724
TRYING TO BRING THEM TOGETHER.

02:12:12.791 --> 02:12:16.228
IS -- AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS

02:12:16.295 --> 02:12:17.396
TO IT MEANS IT IS EVER GOING TO

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:19.364
HAVE AN ARCHITECTURES OF ABLE TO

02:12:19.431 --> 02:12:22.401
OF ALL OF OUR WE BECAUSE OF OF

02:12:22.467 --> 02:12:23.468
GIVEN WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO BUILD

02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:24.569
ON AND MAKES SENSE TO LEVERAGE

02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:26.271
OUR EXISTING SYSTEMS BUT I'M

THERE AND MODULAR APPROACH ISN'T

02:12:30.242 --> 02:12:31.510
SO OR IS THAT WHAT WE'RE GOING

02:12:31.576 --> 02:12:33.512
TO EVENTUALLY EVOLVED INTO WITH

02:12:33.578 --> 02:12:34.746
THIS APPROACH WITH THE IN THE

02:12:34.813 --> 02:12:36.581
FUTURE SINGLE SYSTEM ARE WE JUST

02:12:36.648 --> 02:12:37.182
LIKE OKAY WE'RE TRYING IGURE

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.183

WHEN I HAVE SOME SINGLE.

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:40.819
SYSTEM AT THE END OF IT BUT THN

02:12:40.886 --> 02:12:42.587
SOME POINT LATER WE'RE GOING TO

02:12:42.654 --> 02:12:46.458
HAVE TO REBUILD THE WHOLE THING

02:12:46.525 --> 02:12:48.860
I JUST I I'M TRYING TO I'M

HOW THIS BEFORE WE GET TOWARD

02:12:51.997 --> 02:12:53.632
THE END OF THIS PROCESS WHICH

02:12:53.699 --> 02:12:54.333
WILL BE BEYOND MY TIME CELL WILL

02:12:54.399 --> 02:12:55.000
BE?

02:12:55.067 --> 02:12:56.535
SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HAVE TO

02:12:56.601 --> 02:12:57.869
FIGURE FIGURE OUT ABOUT IT WHEN

02:12:57.936 --> 02:12:59.871
IT FLOWS IF IT BLOWS UP I WAS A

02:12:59.938 --> 02:13:01.940
WIN BECAUSE WE HAVE A SUCCESS

02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:06.011
LIKE THE PROGRAM -- THAT -- THAT --

02:13:06.078 --> 02:13:07.612
YOU KNOW HOW HOW.

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:11.983
HOW DO I HOW HOW WE MAKE THIS

02:13:12.050 --> 02:13:14.019
WORK?

02:13:14.086 --> 02:13:14.986
LET ME LET ME GIVE SOME THOUGHTS

02:13:15.053 --> 02:13:16.488
ON THAT -- AND THEN AND THEN

02:13:16.555 --> 02:13:17.889
MAYBE MISTER RELATING IT YOU

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:19.291
YEAH SOME TECHNICAL QUESTIONS --

02:13:19.358 --> 02:13:19.958
TO SORT OF STEPPING BACK --

02:13:20.025 --> 02:13:21.360
AGAIN THE ORIGINAL PLAN WAS

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:24.096
THREE SYSTEMS TO TO SYSTEMS TO

02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.197
ONE FOR REALLY SIMPLIFYING AYE

02:13:25.263 --> 02:13:27.132
WE REALLY REPLACE THE NUMBER TO

02:13:27.199 --> 02:13:30.369
WITH THE WORD TEO THREE TWO ONE

02:13:30.435 --> 02:13:32.471
THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DOING NOW --

02:13:32.537 --> 02:13:34.539
IT THAT THAT CAME AS A CHANGE IN

02:13:34.606 --> 02:13:35.440
THE CAME TO US FROM THE FEDERAL

02:13:35.507 --> 02:13:37.809
GOVERNMENT IN LATE TWO THOUSAND

02:13:37.876 --> 02:13:38.744
SIXTEEN AND THEY WERE TALKING

02:13:38.810 --> 02:13:39.845
ABOUT A VERY.

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:43.382
HARD DEADLINE OF BY THE END OF

02:13:43.448 --> 02:13:43.982
TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE NOT

02:13:44.049 --> 02:13:44.649
GOING TO THEY WERE NOT GOING TO

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:46.651
PAY FOR ANOTHER SYSTEM SO.

02:13:46.718 --> 02:13:49.054
A TON OF PLANNING WENT INTO

02:13:49.121 --> 02:13:51.089
REALLY THINKING AHEAD TO WHAT

02:13:51.156 --> 02:13:54.526
THAT ULTIMATE SYSTEM SHOULD LOOK

02:13:54.593 --> 02:13:56.027
LINE.

02:13:56.094 --> 02:13:57.362
THINKING ABOUT CAL WHEN DOING

02:13:57.429 --> 02:13:59.765
USER LABS LOOKING AT ALL THREE

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:01.133
SYSTEMS AND A LOT OF THAT

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:03.402
HAPPENED IN SEVENTEEN AND MORE

02:14:03.468 --> 02:14:04.936
OF IT HAPPENED IN EIGHTEEN WE

02:14:05.003 --> 02:14:06.772
HIRE AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT --

02:14:06.838 --> 02:14:08.640
MCKINSEY -- HELP WITH A LOT OF

02:14:08.707 --> 02:14:10.409
THAT WORK AND THAT WAS -- THEY

02:14:10.475 --> 02:14:11.777
WERE RESPECTED PARTNER AND

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:12.711
APPRECIATED BY THE FEDERAL

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.112
GOVERNMENT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:14:14.179 --> 02:14:16.548
PLAYED AN ENORMOUS ROLE IN THAT --

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:17.849
PLANNING PROCESS THEY WERE PART

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:20.018
OF MANY MANY OF OUR MEETINGS HE

02:14:20.085 --> 02:14:21.820
OTHER BIG PIECE OF THE FEDERAL

02:14:21.887 --> 02:14:23.488
GUIDANCE THAT WAS WHAT YOU SAID

02:14:23.555 --> 02:14:26.391
THEY THEY DID NOT -- IT WASN'T A

02:14:26.458 --> 02:14:28.059
DESIGN THE VERY BEST SYSTEM FROM

02:14:28.126 --> 02:14:29.461
SCRATCH IT TO LEVERAGE THOSE

02:14:29.528 --> 02:14:31.129
EXISTING SYSTEMS AND THEY WERE

02:14:31.196 --> 02:14:32.397
LOOKING AT THE ENORMOUS

02:14:32.464 --> 02:14:34.566
INVESTMENT THAT WAS MADE AND

02:14:34.633 --> 02:14:35.700
WHAT WE CALL EL ARE ASKED THE

02:14:35.767 --> 02:14:37.335
LEADER REPLACEMENT SYSTEM LOS

02:14:37.402 --> 02:14:38.703
ANGELES THE SYSTEM.

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:41.406
SO -- AND THERE ARE A LOT OF

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:42.174
LESSONS LEARNED I THINK WHAT MR

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:43.975
AS LANEY IN MENTIONED ABOUT SOME

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.076
OF THOSE KIND OF ROUGH

02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:46.711
TRANSITIONS WHEN WE WENT WHEN

02:14:46.778 --> 02:14:48.280
CAL WENT WENT LIVE AGAINST ITS

02:14:48.346 --> 02:14:49.915
LEGACY SYSTEM.

02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.349
AND EVEN WITH ALL OUR ELSE --

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:52.918
NOT NOT NOT QUITE THE SAME THAT

02:14:52.984 --> 02:14:53.518
DAY BUT THERE WERE SOME REAL

02:14:53.585 --> 02:14:55.053
TRANSITION AND THERE ARE LESSONS

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:56.721
LEARNED AND THOSE ARE ISSUES THE

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.190
ADVOCATES OF REYES WITH US.

02:14:58.256 --> 02:15:01.293
AND REALLY NEXT MONTH WE'RE

02:15:01.359 --> 02:15:02.794
HOPING T KIND OF SEQUENCE A

02:15:02.861 --> 02:15:04.529
WHOLE SERIES OF REALLYIMPORTANT

02:15:04.596 --> 02:15:05.831
ADVOCATE CONCERNS AND FIGURE OUT

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:07.966
WHEN DO THEY REALLY FIT IN THIS

02:15:08.033 --> 02:15:08.967
LIFE CYCLE.

02:15:09.034 --> 02:15:10.469
AS MR BLAME MENTIONED WERE

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:12.938
MOVING VERY QUICKLY -- INTO ONE

02:15:13.004 --> 02:15:15.407
OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PUBLIC

02:15:15.474 --> 02:15:16.575
FACING FACES AND THAT'S THAT'S

02:15:16.641 --> 02:15:19.077
THE PORTAL AND THE MOBILE OUT.

02:15:19.144 --> 02:15:20.812
AND ESSENTIALLY THERE WERE GOING

02:15:20.879 --> 02:15:22.113
TO BE ABLE TO BRING ADVOCATES A

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.281
STAKEHOLDERS IN FROM THE

02:15:23.348 --> 02:15:25.083
BEGINNING BECAUSE THAT'S GOING

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:25.851
TO BE A SEPARATE PROCUREMENT

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.152
THEY CAN EVEN BE PART OF THE

02:15:27.219 --> 02:15:28.286
PROCUREMENT AND THE SETTING OF

02:15:28.353 --> 02:15:29.654
SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS.

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:30.789
AND WE'RE LOOKING REALLY LOOKING

02:15:30.856 --> 02:15:32.123
FORWARD TO THAT INPUT SO THERE'S

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:34.359
BEEN A LOT OF A LOT OF PLANNING

02:15:34.426 --> 02:15:36.394
WORK HAD TO BE DONE UNDER THAT

02:15:36.461 --> 02:15:38.263
FEDERAL DEADLINE AND A LOT OF

02:15:38.330 --> 02:15:40.098
OUR INTERACTION WITH THE

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:41.500
STAKEHOLDERS HAS BEEN CATCHING

02:15:41.566 --> 02:15:43.068
THEM UP AND SHARING THAT.

02:15:43.134 --> 02:15:44.803
AND REALLY NOW WE'RE REALLY

02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:46.271
EXCITED TO BE MOVING INTO A MORE

02:15:46.338 --> 02:15:48.173
ACTIVE PHASE OF GETTING THEIR

02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:50.308
MORE DIRECT INPUT ON THE ACTUAL

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:52.177
THINGS AND THEN SEQUENCING IN

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:57.983
LIKE I SAID EVERYTHING WE ALL

02:15:58.049 --> 02:15:59.351
THE CONCERNS THAT THEY REYES.

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:00.318
THEY HAVE THE PLACE WE HAVEN'T

02:16:00.385 --> 02:16:01.386
TALKED ABOUT THE MALL YET BUT WE

02:16:01.453 --> 02:16:02.654
WILL AND AND WE'LL WORK WITH

02:16:02.721 --> 02:16:03.255
THEM AND FIGURE OUT THE RIGHT

02:16:03.321 --> 02:16:03.455
TIME.

02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:04.289
I HOPE THAT ANSWERS SOME OF YOUR

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:05.557
QUESTIONS -- SORT OF BUT I'M

02:16:05.624 --> 02:16:06.191
ALSO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT AND

02:16:06.258 --> 02:16:07.726
WHAT DO I GET BACK TO SOME OF

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:09.194
THE INTERFACE ISSUES --

02:16:09.261 --> 02:16:10.962
ESPECIALLY -- FOR THE

02:16:11.029 --> 02:16:12.664
BENEFICIARIES BUT IN TERMS OF SO

02:16:12.731 --> 02:16:15.333
AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS RIGHT

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:16.535
AND AND THE UNDERSTAND SO

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:17.602
GOVERNMENT WANTS YOU TO USE A

02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:19.037
MADE A HUGE INVESTMENT ON THIS

02:16:19.104 --> 02:16:22.007
UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE FOR I

02:16:22.073 --> 02:16:23.942
GUESS IT'S L. R. S. RIGHT.

02:16:24.009 --> 02:16:26.611
IT SO WHEN WE END UP IN.

02:16:26.678 --> 02:16:32.217
WITH OUR UNIFIED SYSTEM IN.

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:32.884
TWENTY TWENTY THREE I GUESS IT'S

02:16:32.951 --> 02:16:33.418
A GOOD SO WE ASK ABOUT THE

02:16:33.485 --> 02:16:34.352
QUESTION THE NATURE OF THAT

02:16:34.419 --> 02:16:36.454
SYSTEM AND IS IS A PLAN TO TRY

02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:38.957
TO GET IT TO A PLACE WHERE --

02:16:39.024 --> 02:16:40.258
THIS IS WE WILL HAVE A NEED TO

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:42.127
ADD FUNCTIONALITY ETCETERA IS

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:43.061
THAT WE COULD SEE AN

02:16:43.128 --> 02:16:44.062
ARCHITECTURE THAT AS ACTUALLY

02:16:44.129 --> 02:16:45.263
PERHAPS MORE.

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:47.265
FLEXIBLE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:48.266
I JUST DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:50.368
LRS IT'S WAS WELL YOU KNOW WHAT

02:16:50.435 --> 02:16:52.137
GIVEN WHEN IT'S DEVELOPED AND

02:16:52.203 --> 02:16:53.939
WHAT'S LIKE BUT AND AND AND

02:16:54.005 --> 02:16:54.239
MAYBE ALSO.

02:16:54.306 --> 02:16:55.473
TECHNOLOGY CAN.

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:56.741
CAN CAN COMMENT ABOUT YOUR

02:16:56.808 --> 02:16:59.678
INVOLVEMENT IN THIS AS WELL SO

02:16:59.744 --> 02:17:00.245
YEAH.

02:17:00.312 --> 02:17:02.013
A DOCTOR BALLOT THINK IT'S THAT

02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:02.814
IT'S A GOOD AND FAIR QUESTION.

02:17:02.881 --> 02:17:03.748
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE FIRST THING

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:05.517
THAT -- DEPUTY DIRECTOR DUDLEY

02:17:05.584 --> 02:17:08.820
SPOKE ABOUT WAS THE MOVEMENT OF

02:17:08.887 --> 02:17:10.522
THE LRSD PLATFORM OFF OF AN ON

02:17:10.589 --> 02:17:12.290
PREMISES DATA CENTER TO A MODERN

02:17:12.357 --> 02:17:15.160
DATA CENTER -- WE ARE GOING TO

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:18.196
THE A WS -- A CLOUD WE'RE GOING

02:17:18.263 --> 02:17:20.031
TO FIRST BRING UP PRODUCTION LOS

02:17:20.098 --> 02:17:23.034
ANGELES COUNTY WITHIN TWENTY

02:17:23.101 --> 02:17:24.369
NINETEEN TO THAT PRODUCTION --

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:26.037
CLOUD AN UPDATE THAT THAT GIVES

02:17:26.104 --> 02:17:28.373
US MORE FLEXIBILITY AND SOME

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:30.609
MODERN COMPONENTS THAT WE CAN

02:17:30.675 --> 02:17:32.377
ENACT AS WE GO FORWARD.

02:17:32.444 --> 02:17:33.945
IT'S ALSO IN ORDER IF APPROACH

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:35.914
TO BE ABLE TO SEE HIM PRODUCTION

02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:38.183
HOW THAT'S HOW THAT'S WORKING

02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:39.250
THERE ALSO LEVER LEVERAGING

02:17:39.317 --> 02:17:40.819
PROCUREMENTS THAT ARE

02:17:40.885 --> 02:17:41.653
ADMINISTERED BY THE DEARTMENT

02:17:41.720 --> 02:17:42.687
OF TECHNOLOGY.

02:17:42.754 --> 02:17:44.522
AND CONTRACTS THAT THEY'VE PUT

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:45.824
IN PLACE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

02:17:45.890 --> 02:17:47.659
THAT PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:57.569
FOUNDATION SO THAT WE'RE ON A

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:58.303
MODERN ARCHITECTURE.

02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:59.270
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

02:17:59.337 --> 02:18:00.538
TO DO IN ORDER TO SCALE TO FIFTY

02:18:00.605 --> 02:18:00.905
EIGHT COUNTIES.

02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:01.573
IS RE ARCHITECTING SOME OF OUR

02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:02.674
NIGHTLY BATCH JOBS TO BE ABLE TO

02:18:02.741 --> 02:18:03.642
HAVE A MORE MODERN STREAMING

02:18:03.708 --> 02:18:05.977
ARCHITECTURE. TO COME TO A NEW --

02:18:06.044 --> 02:18:08.813
REPORTS MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO

02:18:08.880 --> 02:18:10.482
MINE DATA BATTERED FOR

02:18:10.548 --> 02:18:12.150
DEPARTMENTS USE IN THOSE TYPES

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.451
OF THINGS THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN

02:18:13.518 --> 02:18:15.020
AND ARE BEING BUILT INTO THE

02:18:15.086 --> 02:18:16.621
BUDGET AS WE O FORWARD.

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:18.690
SO IT IS MORE MODULAR AND IT IS

02:18:18.757 --> 02:18:21.159
MORE -- MODERN AS WE GO FORWARD

02:18:21.226 --> 02:18:22.360
SO THAT WE DON'T IMPLEMENT A

02:18:22.427 --> 02:18:24.596
SYSTEM THAT IS OUTDATED FROM

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:26.965
FIRST DAY BUT THE DIE HAS BEEN

02:18:27.032 --> 02:18:27.799
SET.

02:18:27.866 --> 02:18:29.501
BY OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS SAYING

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:31.603
YOU WILL LEVERAGE LRS.

02:18:31.670 --> 02:18:33.838
IT WILL BE ACCOMMODATE THE FIFTY

02:18:33.905 --> 02:18:35.473
EIGHT COUNTIES SO THERE IS A LOT

02:18:35.540 --> 02:18:37.075
OF FUNCTIONALITY ENHANCEMENTS.

02:18:37.142 --> 02:18:38.643
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE IN ORDER TO

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:39.678
SCALE FOR STATE IS LARGEST

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:43.682
CALIFORNIA ARCHITECTURAL

02:18:43.748 --> 02:18:45.050
ENHANCEMENTS SO WE'RE NOT.

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:45.750
IMPLEMENTING AN OUTDATED

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:48.286
ARCHITECTURE WHEN WE GO LIVE.

02:18:48.353 --> 02:18:50.522
RIGHT IS HELPFUL.

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:52.323
THE COMMENTS FROM TECHNOLOGY BUT

02:18:52.390 --> 02:18:54.159
YOU'RE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS

02:18:54.225 --> 02:18:55.827
AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES THERE.

02:18:55.894 --> 02:18:57.729
SO DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY --

02:18:57.796 --> 02:18:59.330
WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OF

02:18:59.397 --> 02:19:01.166
SYSTEM INTEGRATION -- WE WE'VE

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:02.534
BEEN MONITORING WE'VE BEEN --

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:03.768
WORKING WITH THEM TO GET THIS

02:19:03.835 --> 02:19:05.737
STATUS AS AS IT'S GONE THROUGH

02:19:05.804 --> 02:19:08.106
THIS FEDERAL APPROVAL PROCESS.

02:19:08.173 --> 02:19:10.675
AND AS MISPLACING HAS STATED IT

02:19:10.742 --> 02:19:13.478
IS IT WAS -- THE DECISION'S BEEN

02:19:13.545 --> 02:19:15.613
MADE BUT IT WASN'T MADE --

02:19:15.680 --> 02:19:17.415
LIGHTLY I AM IN THE THE AMOUNT

02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:18.783
OF DISCOVERY THAT THAT WE HAVE

02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.118
WITNESSED GOING INTO THESE

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:22.087
DECISIONS IMPROVING NOW THAT

02:19:22.153 --> 02:19:24.422
THAT THIS WOULD WORK -- WAS WAS

02:19:24.489 --> 02:19:26.725
VERY IN DEPTH BEFORE YOU'RE AT

02:19:26.791 --> 02:19:28.560
THAT THE STAGE YOU ARE TODAY --

02:19:28.626 --> 02:19:31.096
IN ADDITION -- LEVERAGING YOU

02:19:31.162 --> 02:19:32.464
KNOW THE CONTRACT VEHICLES THAT

02:19:32.530 --> 02:19:35.734
DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY -- HAVE

02:19:35.800 --> 02:19:39.037
HAVE -- PUT OUT THERE -- IS A

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:40.171
GREAT PARTNERSHIP FROM THE

02:19:40.238 --> 02:19:41.773
COUNTY CONSORTIA LEVEL TO THE

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.007
STATE LEVEL SO THAT WE WE ARE

02:19:43.074 --> 02:19:44.309
SEEING THE SAME THINGS IN THESE

02:19:44.375 --> 02:19:46.778
MODERN -- ARCHITECTURES AND WE

02:19:46.845 --> 02:19:48.279
CAN YOU LEVERAGE THE LESSONS

02:19:48.346 --> 02:19:50.448
LEARNED -- FROM BOTH THE STATE

02:19:50.515 --> 02:19:54.018
AND THE COUNTY SIDE.

02:19:54.085 --> 02:19:57.055
AND A FREE **** ACTUALLY THE

02:19:57.122 --> 02:19:59.424
CLOUD THE SECOND PIECE THAT IS

02:19:59.491 --> 02:20:01.926
THAT SOMEONE ELSE IS A STATE

02:20:01.993 --> 02:20:02.794
OPERATED CLOUD.

02:20:02.861 --> 02:20:05.597
IT'S PUBLIC CLOUD EIGHT OF U. S. --

02:20:05.663 --> 02:20:08.399
BUT THROUGH THE CONTRACTS THAT

02:20:08.466 --> 02:20:10.001
THE DEPARTMENT TECHNO QUE ALL

02:20:10.068 --> 02:20:11.703
RIGHT.

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:12.670
THEN ONCE AS THE CLOUD THE CLOUD

02:20:12.737 --> 02:20:15.540
IS ACTUALLY PHYSICALS.

02:20:15.607 --> 02:20:17.976
CONNECTION IN THE US RIGHT AND

02:20:18.042 --> 02:20:19.611
YOU KNOW THERE'S IT'S SOMEONE

02:20:19.677 --> 02:20:21.579
ELSE'S SERVER SO CONFIDENTIALITY

02:20:21.646 --> 02:20:23.982
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF RIGHT SO.

02:20:24.048 --> 02:20:25.650
STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS HAS MADE

02:20:25.717 --> 02:20:27.285
SURE THAT THE SECURITY LEVELS

02:20:27.352 --> 02:20:29.354
ARE ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE THE

02:20:29.420 --> 02:20:30.555
PROJECTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO USE

02:20:30.622 --> 02:20:33.591
IT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I THINK

02:20:33.658 --> 02:20:34.058
THAT'S GONNA BE ROOM.

02:20:34.125 --> 02:20:37.729
FOR I MEAN. FOR MY COMES THAT TO

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:39.664
THAT OKAY AND I I HEARD ABOUT

02:20:39.731 --> 02:20:41.065
THINGS LIKE MOBILE AND OTHER

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:42.667
THINGS SO IN TERMS OF FEATURE WE

02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:45.403
HAVE THE APPROPRIATE INTERFACES

02:20:45.470 --> 02:20:47.172
FOR BOTH WHETHER STRICTLY WITH.

02:20:47.238 --> 02:20:49.507
THE VAN FISHERIES OR THROUGH TO

02:20:49.574 --> 02:20:51.743
CASE WORKERS -- WE HEARD

02:20:51.810 --> 02:20:57.215
TESTIMONY ABOUT -- ILL WITH.

02:20:57.282 --> 02:20:58.149
SOMEONE GO IT WILL BE DOING

02:20:58.216 --> 02:20:59.083
FOCUS GROUP TESTS ON THESE

02:20:59.150 --> 02:21:01.619
INTERFACES TO BE SURE THAT --

02:21:01.686 --> 02:21:03.721
WITH CLIENTS THAT THEY THEY

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:05.590
ACTUALLY THE QUESTIONS IN THE

02:21:05.657 --> 02:21:06.958
WAY THEY'RE PRESENTED AND SO

02:21:07.025 --> 02:21:09.127
FORTH MAKES SENSE IN THAT --

02:21:09.194 --> 02:21:10.562
EASILY UNDERSTANDABLE AND I

02:21:10.628 --> 02:21:11.863
DON'T ABOUT LANGUAGES AS WELL

02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:14.365
GIVEN THAT THE INTERFACES --

02:21:14.432 --> 02:21:15.700
THAT THE FOR THE SPEECH FOR THE

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:16.901
INTERFACE IS THAT THE CLIENTS

02:21:16.968 --> 02:21:18.102
WHO ARE GOING TO SEE THAT WE'RE

02:21:18.169 --> 02:21:19.504
GOING TO HAVE FLANK THE ALL

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:20.171
DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THAT PEOPLE

02:21:20.238 --> 02:21:21.206
CAN.

02:21:21.272 --> 02:21:22.807
DIRECTLY SEE.

02:21:22.874 --> 02:21:23.808
CASEY TO WHAT KIND OF WORK

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:25.410
YOU'RE DOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN

02:21:25.476 --> 02:21:27.645
YES THE THE SHORT ANSWER IS IS

02:21:27.712 --> 02:21:29.714
IS YES TO THOSE WERE GOING TAKE

02:21:29.781 --> 02:21:31.249
BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

02:21:31.316 --> 02:21:32.116
AND NOW WE'RE GONNA WAKE WORK

02:21:32.183 --> 02:21:33.318
WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:34.252
MAKE SURE THAT ALL THOSE

02:21:34.319 --> 02:21:35.453
REQUIREMENTS ARE IN THERE AS WE

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:36.721
SECURE A VENDOR.

02:21:36.788 --> 02:21:38.656
AND TO BE ABLE BY IDENTIFY AND

02:21:38.723 --> 02:21:41.559
WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS ON

02:21:41.626 --> 02:21:43.127
WHO ARE THE INDIVIDUALS TO BE

02:21:43.194 --> 02:21:45.029
INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN AND MAKE

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:46.464
SURE THAT THERE ARE FOCUS GROUPS

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:48.900
AND PUBLIC GROUPS THAT WOULD BE

02:21:48.967 --> 02:21:50.034
ABLE TO USE THIS.

02:21:50.101 --> 02:21:52.403
AND LOOK AT THE USER INTERFACE

02:21:52.470 --> 02:21:58.176
OF THIS AND WORK THROUGH THAT

02:21:58.243 --> 02:21:58.710
AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S

02:21:58.776 --> 02:22:01.145
ROBUST TESTING. ONE SIX OF THE

02:22:01.212 --> 02:22:02.247
MOTHER -- I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE

02:22:02.313 --> 02:22:02.881
NOT I MEAN WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT

02:22:02.947 --> 02:22:03.448
HAPPENED YET AND I THINK WE

02:22:03.514 --> 02:22:04.616
HAVEN'T SEEN IT HAPPEN YOU KNOW

02:22:04.682 --> 02:22:05.717
JUST LOOKING AT EL ARRESTED AS

02:22:05.783 --> 02:22:06.851
PEOPLE INTERACT WITH THE C. FOR

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:07.385
ENOUGH SEE FOR YOURSELF.

02:22:07.452 --> 02:22:09.420
PORTAL IT IT'S NOT USER FRIENDLY

02:22:09.487 --> 02:22:10.722
RIGHT NOW AND WE COULD SHOW YOU

02:22:10.788 --> 02:22:12.390
SCREEN SHOTS OF IT IS EXTREMELY

02:22:12.457 --> 02:22:13.658
HARD TO NAVIGATE AND TO

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.560
UNDERSTAND -- EVEN YOU KNOW WITH

02:22:15.627 --> 02:22:17.195
A MASTER'S DEGREE IN ALL THESE

02:22:17.262 --> 02:22:18.863
SORTS OF THINGS IT'S TRICKY --

02:22:18.930 --> 02:22:20.031
AND SO I THINK WE WANT TO MAKE

02:22:20.098 --> 02:22:20.932
SURE THAT THAT IS YOU KNOW

02:22:20.999 --> 02:22:22.533
CONTINUALLY GOING ON AND THAT

02:22:22.600 --> 02:22:24.636
ALSO IT'S IT'S NOT ONLY THOSE

02:22:24.702 --> 02:22:26.504
PORTALS AS YOU MENTIONED -- I

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:27.639
THINK WITH THE VERIFICATION HOW

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:28.806
PROJECT THAT WAS A REALLY

02:22:28.873 --> 02:22:30.875
IMPORTANT DECISION BECAUSE THESE

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:32.310
WORK GROUPS ARE I. T. GROUPS.

02:22:32.377 --> 02:22:34.045
AND THEY DON'T SET POLICY BUT

02:22:34.112 --> 02:22:36.447
THEY IN TURN POLICY IN A WAY BY

02:22:36.514 --> 02:22:36.981
THE INTERACTIONS THAT THEY

02:22:37.048 --> 02:22:38.950
SCRIPT OUT AND SO WHEN YOU'RE

02:22:39.017 --> 02:22:39.517
LOOKING AT SOMETHING LIKE

02:22:39.584 --> 02:22:41.019
VERIFICATIONS YOU COULD HAVE

02:22:41.085 --> 02:22:42.420
POLICY ABOUT VERIFICATION.

02:22:42.487 --> 02:22:44.188
BUT YOU COULD SET A TONE IN THE

02:22:44.255 --> 02:22:45.924
QUESTIONS THAT A WORKER ASKS OR

02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:47.258
HOW THEY MOVE THROUGH THE

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:48.893
PROCESS THAT EITHER OPENS IT UP

02:22:48.960 --> 02:22:50.061
TO SAY WE'RE GONNA PAYING EVERY

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:51.362
OPTION POSSIBLE.

02:22:51.429 --> 02:22:52.764
OR CAN SAY THIS IS AMERICA

02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:54.666
VERIFICATION PRESENTED OR WERE

02:22:54.732 --> 02:22:56.200
DONE AND THOSE SORTS OF

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:58.036
TECHNOLOGICAL SCRIPTS ACTUALLY

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.771
GUIDE THAT HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND

02:22:59.837 --> 02:23:01.439
SO WE DO CARE A LOT ABOUT THE

02:23:01.506 --> 02:23:02.807
PORTAL ON THE WEBSITE.

02:23:02.874 --> 02:23:04.409
BUT WE'RE WE'RE JUST REALLY

02:23:04.475 --> 02:23:06.010
CONCERNED THAT I. T. DECISIONS

02:23:06.077 --> 02:23:07.312
THAT COULD SEEM LIKE YOUR I. T.

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:08.346
DECISIONS.

02:23:08.413 --> 02:23:10.548
CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON ON CLIENTS

02:23:10.615 --> 02:23:11.916
AND SO WHILE WE CAN'T BE THERE

02:23:11.983 --> 02:23:12.750
FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE

02:23:12.817 --> 02:23:14.018
DECISIONS THAT'S WHY WE WANT

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:19.590
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:21.125
THE FOCUS OF THE PROJECT.

02:23:21.192 --> 02:23:23.561
OKAY DOES I NEEDED THAT.

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:24.195
SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY

02:23:24.262 --> 02:23:25.163
IMPORTANT THAT RESIDENTS I SAID

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:25.964
BEFORE THE SUCCESS OF ANY I. T.

02:23:26.030 --> 02:23:27.165
PROJECT ACTUALLY IS USUALLY NOT

02:23:27.231 --> 02:23:29.033
THE I. T. ITSELF THE TECHNICAL

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.401
GUYS CAN USUALLY FIGURE STUFF

02:23:30.468 --> 02:23:32.337
OUT BUT HE SAID THAT.

02:23:32.403 --> 02:23:33.571
THE DIET AND BASICALLY THE

02:23:33.638 --> 02:23:35.473
DELUDE DESIGNING THE UNDERLYING

02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:36.574
YELL DID YOU EAT.

02:23:36.641 --> 02:23:37.542
THE STUFF UNDER THE HOOD MAY

02:23:37.608 --> 02:23:40.244
WORK BUT THE ON THE STEERING

02:23:40.311 --> 02:23:41.746
WHEEL DOESN'T REALLY TURN THE

02:23:41.813 --> 02:23:43.781
BRAKES NEEDS A TOO MUCH PRESSURE

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:45.883
SO FORTH AND THE VEHICLE DOESN'T

02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:47.452
WORK RIGHT FOR TO TO A PERSON

02:23:47.518 --> 02:23:48.453
HAS TO USE IT.

02:23:48.519 --> 02:23:52.023
SO -- SO HOPEFULLY HE SAID --

02:23:52.090 --> 02:23:59.864
BUT THEN IT WILL IT ELKS GIVE IT

02:23:59.931 --> 02:24:02.467
YET AND SO -- IT'S A BIG BUDGET

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:03.501
ITEM OBVIOUSLY Là IT'S VERY

02:24:03.568 --> 02:24:04.202
IMPORTANT SYSTEM BUT I HOPE THAT

02:24:04.268 --> 02:24:04.836
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO

02:24:04.902 --> 02:24:05.970
BE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE KIND OF

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:06.971
WORK ON THE INTERFACES SHOES AND

02:24:07.038 --> 02:24:09.741
THAT'S WITH THE CLIENTS AND ALSO

02:24:09.807 --> 02:24:11.175
WITH THE PEOPLE AT THE USE THE

02:24:11.242 --> 02:24:12.176
SYSTEM.

02:24:12.243 --> 02:24:15.013
AND THAT AND SO THAT THEIR

02:24:15.079 --> 02:24:16.748
NOLLIE WELL TRAINED USES THE

02:24:16.814 --> 02:24:18.282
SYSTEM BUT EVEN ORE POORLY THE

02:24:18.349 --> 02:24:20.551
SYSTEM IS WORKS FOR THEM IS

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:23.087
INTUITIVE -- FOR THEM AND FOR

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:24.322
CLIENTS AND THAT ACTUALLY WE

02:24:24.389 --> 02:24:25.723
WANTED THAT THEY'D BE GOOD IF

02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:27.692
THERE'S ACTUALLY -- SINCE WE'RE

02:24:27.759 --> 02:24:29.627
TALKING TECHNOLOGY WHERE WE CAN

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.629
ACTUALLY EMPOWER CLIENTS WITH

02:24:31.696 --> 02:24:33.164
THE SYSTEM TO GIVE THEM MORE

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:34.732
INFORMATION FOR THEMSELVES SO

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:36.100
THAT THEY CAN THAT THAT THEY CAN

02:24:36.167 --> 02:24:37.602
ACT ON INCIDENTS LIKE WONDERING

02:24:37.668 --> 02:24:39.404
WHAT'S THIS MYSTERIOUS BLACK BOX

02:24:39.470 --> 02:24:41.372
AND I HAVE TO ASK MY CASE WORKER

02:24:41.439 --> 02:24:42.340
AND ON A CASE WORKER.

02:24:42.407 --> 02:24:46.010
CAN TELL MYSELF I CAN LOOK UP

02:24:46.077 --> 02:24:47.011
STUFF.

02:24:47.078 --> 02:24:48.012
ABOUT MYSELF MY OWN IN THEIR OWN

02:24:48.079 --> 02:24:49.213
SYSTEM AT SOMETHING WE EXPECT

02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:51.783
MAULER OTHER SYSTEMS RIGHT WE GO

02:24:51.849 --> 02:24:53.384
TO HIM WE TOOK UPPER COUNTS

02:24:53.451 --> 02:24:54.552
ONLINE WITH ITS ADDRESS WE

02:24:54.619 --> 02:24:55.153
SHOULD HOPEFULLY.

02:24:55.219 --> 02:24:55.787
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PROVIDE A

02:24:55.853 --> 02:24:56.454
LOT OF VERY PERSONAL INFORMATION

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:59.424
ABOUT THEMSELVES SO THAT THEY

02:24:59.490 --> 02:25:01.292
CAN GET ACCESS SERVICES.

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:02.193
THEY SHOULD ALSO GET.

02:25:02.260 --> 02:25:04.262
FEEDBACK THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

02:25:04.328 --> 02:25:05.630
IS TO NOT ONLY WHAT WHAT THE

02:25:05.696 --> 02:25:06.731
SYSTEM KNOWS ABOUT THEM BUT ALSO

02:25:06.798 --> 02:25:08.533
WHAT THE SYSTEM CAN DO FOR THEM

02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:09.434
AND NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY GO

02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:11.102
THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE TO FIND OUT

02:25:11.169 --> 02:25:13.538
IF WE CAN BUILD THAT KIND OF

02:25:13.604 --> 02:25:15.440
INTO THEIR BABY.

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:16.741
THE CLOUDS OF SILS SEE VALUE IN

02:25:16.808 --> 02:25:17.475
OUR BASEMENT AS WELL.

02:25:17.542 --> 02:25:19.143
SO THAT [inaudible]

02:25:19.210 --> 02:25:20.745
OKAY [inaudible]

02:25:20.812 --> 02:25:23.214
ALL RIGHT.

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:25.016
BOY I WAS GONNA TAKE QUESTIONS

I WOULD SAY -- I AGREE THAT I

02:32:36.881 --> 02:32:38.182
THINK THAT THAT IN OUR HEARTS WE

02:32:38.249 --> 02:32:39.650

THE HEAD SOMETIMES I CAN GET

02:32:47.691 --> 02:32:49.426
LOST IN THE SHUFFLE A LITTLE BIT --

02:32:49.493 --> 02:32:51.095
WE'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE

02:32:51.161 --> 02:32:52.429
STAKEHOLDER GROUP AND I AGREE

02:32:52.496 --> 02:32:54.064
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF MOVEMENT

02:32:54.131 --> 02:32:54.965
TOWARD KIND OF GETTING TO KNOW

02:32:55.032 --> 02:32:56.667
EACH OTHER BETTER AND GETTING

02:32:56.734 --> 02:32:57.468
READY TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT

02:32:57.535 --> 02:33:00.170
DEEPER -- SO I APPRECIATE THAT --

02:33:00.237 --> 02:33:01.438
I WANTED TO JUST ONE QUESTION

02:33:01.505 --> 02:33:03.173
THAT THAT YOU ASKED ABOUT

02:33:03.240 --> 02:33:05.509

02:33:05.576 --> 02:33:09.914
IS IN THE TRANSITION PEER AT THE

02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:11.415
CONCERNS ARE IN TRANSITION.

02:33:11.482 --> 02:33:12.182
IT OR SORT OF THE CORE

02:33:12.249 --> 02:33:12.816
FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM AND

02:33:12.883 --> 02:33:13.484
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES

02:33:13.551 --> 02:33:14.351
I YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE THERE

02:33:14.418 --> 02:33:15.252
ARE WORRIES ABOUT THE TRANSITION

02:33:15.319 --> 02:33:16.120
THAT.

02:33:16.186 --> 02:33:18.188
BUT THAT ON ADVOCATES HAVE --

02:33:18.255 --> 02:33:20.558
THAT THAT I THINK WE ALL HAVE WE

02:33:20.624 --> 02:33:22.359
HAVEN'T I AGREE -- MINISTER PLAN

02:33:22.426 --> 02:33:23.093
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO DIG

02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:25.596
INTO WHAT THOSE CONCERNS ARE AND

02:33:25.663 --> 02:33:26.730
HOW MUCH IS BEING ADDRESSED

02:33:26.797 --> 02:33:28.132
ALREADY AND THAT KIND OF THING.

02:33:28.198 --> 02:33:28.766
THERE BUT THERE ARE OTHER

02:33:28.832 --> 02:33:30.734
UNDERLYING -- PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:33:30.801 --> 02:33:32.202
EXISTING SYSTEMS THAT I HOPE

02:33:32.269 --> 02:33:35.039
WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEW --

02:33:35.105 --> 02:33:36.840
WHEN WHEN THE TRANSITION SO FOR

02:33:36.907 --> 02:33:38.709
EXAMPLE THERE'S REALLY KIND OF

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:40.578
INCONSISTENT -- LIKE A DATA

02:33:40.644 --> 02:33:41.779
COLLECTION ABOUT REALLY

02:33:41.845 --> 02:33:43.647
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT MAKES IT

02:33:43.714 --> 02:33:45.549
SO THAT WE CAN'T KNOW AT THE

02:33:45.616 --> 02:33:47.751
STATE LEVEL LIKE HOW WELL WE'RE

02:33:47.818 --> 02:33:49.920

02:33:54.625 --> 02:33:55.559
COUNTIES AND SAY OKAY WELL

02:33:55.626 --> 02:33:56.493
THEY'RE DOING IT THIS WAY

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.061
THEY'RE DOING IT THAT WAY.

02:33:57.127 --> 02:33:58.462
BUT WE HAVE DATA COLLECTED THE

02:33:58.529 --> 02:34:00.631
