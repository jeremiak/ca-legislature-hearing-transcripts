SUBCOMMITTEE FIVE ON PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE JUDICIARY WILL NOW. BEGIN. I'M WE HAVE PRIMARILY -- OVERSIGHT ITEMS WERE NOT INTENDING TO TAKE ACTION TODAY -- BUT WE WILL HEAR FROM NUMBER OF FOLKS. AND OUR FIRST ISSUE THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISCUSS. IS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH WILL DO ROLL CALL IN A MINUTE. AND ON THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS SO LET'S DO ROLL CALL. TURNER SKINNER. SIR MORLOCK [inaudible] SIR ABOUT. ALL RIGHT -- ARE -- FOR FIRST SPEAKER IS -- HONORARY RICHARD LIVE JANOS THE JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF FROM -- TEN JOAQUIN COUNTY. JUST A SPORTS IS HE HERE YES GREAT HI [inaudible] WELCOME [inaudible] GOOD MORNING. I AM MR THEATER OVER Q. ARE ALSO COME TEAM AT THE TABLE AND FOR SINCE IT'S NOT LISTEN OUR AGENDA. HE IS OUR DIRECTOR AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE BUDGET SERVICES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SO [inaudible] I JUDGE LOBBY ON US GO AHEAD. THANK YOU ON A DAY TO GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY -- TALK YOU BOOK ONE OF MY PASSIONS -- SOMETHING I'VE BEEN DOING FOR ABOUT TEN YEARS IN THE IN THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS -- AND FIRST COURT WAS IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR IN CAL IN CALIFORNIA I'M SURE LITTLE WHILE WE WERE STILL LEARNING -- WISHED WE'RE LEARNING ONE A NICE THINGS ABOUT COLLABORATIVE COURTS IS -- WE HAD WERE DATA DRIVEN REACHER RIVEN -- SO WE DO IT RIGHT WHERE WE HAVE RESEARCH AND DATA TELLS US WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK WHAT WE KEEP WHAT WE SHOULDN'T. SO WERE WERE INVOLVED. EITHER TOTAL OF FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE AND THAT AS IN ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COM AND THEY RANGE FROM YOUR TRADITIONAL DRUG COURT MODEL WHICH THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF ALL THE WAY TO TRUANCY COURTS IN COMMUNITY COURTS IN. A HOMELESS COURTS AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF A DESCRIPTION OF HIM OF THE COURT. KIND OF WORKING ON THE SUPERVISION SIDE WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS TO TRY TO PREVENT THEM FROM RETURNING BACK TO COURT SO IT'S ALL ABOUT. RECIDIVISM REDUCTION IT'S ALL ABOUT REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO COME BACK INTO COURT THE GOING TO PRISON TO GO INTO THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS -- BY DOING THE EARLY IN INTERVENTIONS SO -- WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR A WHILE UNDER US KIND OF A TREND NOW. TO GO BEYOND JUST THE WITH THE TRADITIONAL INDIVIDUAL THAT WOULD GO INTO YOUR TRADITIONAL DRUM CORPS. WHICH IS THE HIGH RISK KIND NEEDS PERSON -- THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT IS A VERY SMALL PERCENT OF OUR OF OUR POPULATION THAT COMES TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE ACTUAL. LARGER NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE WHO COME THROUGH MULTIPLE TIMES ARE HIGH RISK LOW NEEDS -- WHICH NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF MODEL WHICH IS A KIND OF AN ACCOUNTABILITY TYPE MODEL SO WE'RE EXPANDING INTO THINGS LIKE MULTIPLE TRACKS. YOU TAKE ALL THE PEOPLE WHO -- WHO -- SCORE IS A HIGH RISK ON ON AN ASSESSMENT AND THEN BEING ABLE TO DESIGN SOMETHING APPROPRIATE TO MINIMIZE THEIR RETURN. BACK -- SO THE NEW THE NEW THE NEW TREND IS TO USE VALIDATED RISK ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT TOOLS -- TO TELL US WHO IS AT HIGH RISK RE OFFEND JULES BY HAVING THEM SCREENED ASSESSED -- AND THEN REFERRED OUT TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY NEED THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT -- TO WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY NEED AND A MONITOR MAKE SURE THAT SO I KIND OF REFER TO IT AS YOUR TRIAGE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING ON THAT SENTENCE SIDE YET YOU HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE WITH ALL THESE -- TRAUMAS AND DAMAGES INSIDE OF THEM THAT HAVE DRIVEN THE BEHAVIOR TO THIS POINT -- AND IF YOU WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HAVING THEM NOT COME BACK -- IT'S ABOUT ASSESSING THAT SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT FIGURING OUT WHAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM IS AND THEN ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM WHETHER THAT'S THINKING WHETHER THAT'S DEPENDENCE. ON WHATEVER GEARS YOU DESIGN THE PROGRAM AROUND WHAT THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM. AN OVERALL -- STOOD AT THE DELIVERY THE COURTS ARE DOING IT AND DOING IT RIGHT SHOWED DRAMATIC -- REDUCTION IN WRIST IS IN WHICH WORKS FOR EVERYBODY IT'S IN EVERYBODY WINSTON AREA. I MIGHT JUST WANT TO KEEP MY INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS QUICK AS I CAN IT'S MORE ABOUT GETTING THE PANEL THE INFORMATION YOU NEED SO I WANT TO OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. DOES OUR DEPARTMENTS AND WANT TO ADD ANYTHING OR JUST YOU HAVE TO SUPPORT IT IS WORSE IS MY FIRST TIME. HI OKAY I'M I DO A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN OBVIOUSLY. CALL MY COLLEAGUES ON SO. I AM SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH OUR COLLABORATIVE COURTS HAVING -- SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR SOME TIME -- AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE. A GOOD DEAL OF THEM ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE BUT WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN OUR WHAT JUDICIAL BRANCH FUNDS ARE USED TO PAY FOR THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS HOW MUCH OF THIS IS. THE I KIND OF ELECTIVE ON THE PART OF THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS SO DOES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DESIGNATE FOR EVERY -- JURISDICTION A CERTAIN AMOUNT THAT THEY CAN UTILIZE FOR COLLABORATIVE QUARTERS ARE REALLY MUCH MORE THAT. IT'S THE LOCAL AREA THAT DECIDES. THERE IS THE OLD DRUG COURT -- FUNDING MODEL ON DISTRIBUTED OUT AMONGST COURTS AND THAT HAS BEEN DEVOLVED DOWN NOW TO THE COUNTIES ON TO THAT MONEY ACTUALLY GOES THROUGH THE COUNTIES AND COMES TO THE COURT THROUGH THE COUNTIES. ON THE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES ARE IT'S IT'S VERY MUCH A HODGEPODGE EVERY ORDER IS DIFFERENT. AND THERE IS NO ORGANIZED THEMATIC FUNDING SOURCE TO THE INNOVATIONS GRANT WHICH ON WHICH PROVIDE US GREAT JOBS ALLOWED US TO MOVE. LEAPS FORWARD ON OUR ON OUR DIY FOR IN OUR COMMUNITY SUPERVISION CORE ORGANIZING THAT HIGHER E. OUR SYSTEM. I'M IT'S BEEN WONDERFUL FOR THAT SO THERE'S THE INNOVATIONS GRANT COMES THROUGH THERE AND THEN A LOT OF COURTS ARE ACCESSING OTHER GRANTS LIKE. YOUR OBJECT FEDERAL MONEY LIKE BUREAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE -- SAM. ABUSE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION -- AND THEIR EVER AND THOSE TYPE OF GRANTS -- IN OUR COUNTY WE'RE ACTUALLY USING -- HOW MANY -- S. C. C. P. DOLLARS COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS PARTNERSHIP DOLLARS -- THEY HAVE SEEN THE DATA AND THEY HAVE DECIDED TO INVEST IN SOME OF OUR COURT. FROM THAT. AND WE HAVE A VERY GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH A RURAL HEALTH AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH COURT IS ACTUALLY FUNDED PROP SIXTY THREE DOLLARS. ON SO THERE'S NO ONE FORMULA IT'S JUST TRYING. TO GET -- MID TO MATCH -- RESOURCES THE NICE PART ABOUT FOR US WOULD INNOVATION DONE OUT LOUD US TO DO IS LEVERAGE OTHER SOURCES IN COMBINATION WITH THAT. AND THEN BE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER AN OVERALL. SO BUT IN THAT RESPECT WOULD YOU CALL I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE RANT SOURCES AVAILABLE NOW. BUT IF THOSE GRANTS SOURCES WERE TO GO AWAY I MEAN IS THIS. I ASK ABOUT -- FOR SURE YOU KNOW HOW IN A WAY THE QUESTION I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET IS IS THIS A PRIORITY OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BECAUSE IF. IF FROM MY POINT OF VIEW OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF IS NOT DIRECTING SOME PORTION OF ITS FUNDS TOWARDS HIS PURPOSE. AND IS JUST RELYING ON THE CREATIVITY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL OR TO GO AND PURSUE GRANTS. THEN IT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE MAN -- WAYS WHAT LEVEL PRIORITY AND I'M. I THINK THAT. I'M SURE THERE'S A VARIATION DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION AND THE WHAT THE POPULATION IS THEY'RE DEALING WITH WITH THE AXE OR PARTICULAR CLLABORATIVE COURT. BUT OVERALL THE REPORTS I'VE SEEN IS THAT. THEY ARE A RATHER SUCCESSFUL ON I MET THE DAD THE STATE IS EMPLOYING. TO APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH A SET OF FOR WHOM. HOLDING INCARCERATION ALONE OR EVEN COUNTY JAIL ALONE. IS NOT GOING TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS. AND SO SLOW BUT TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS PRIORITY ON THIS -- WELL FIRST. ONE THING THAT THAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT CRAP FUNDING CREATES THAT KIND OF AN IN. INSTABILITY IN MAY MAKES YOU WANT RESCUE ALWAYS. GO OUT THAT THAT IS ABSOLUTE. ON THE OTHER SIDE THOUGH THE ONE THING. I SPEAKING. OF JUDGES ENCOUNTER AND COUNTIES ARE ALL INDIVIDUALLY CONSTITUTIONALLY ELECTED. NO PROGRAM. YOU HAVE A JUDICIAL COMMITMENT -- AND AND NO JUDGE. THE JUDGE WHAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO DO AND HOW YOU HAVE TO DO IT -- SO YOU DO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DOES DIRECT THE FUNDING TO OUR COURT THE TO THE COURTS YES. YES. DID YOU HAVE TO IF YOU WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE YOU HAVE TO GET BY YOU HAVE TO GET THAT BUY IN FROM FROM THE JUDGES -- AT LEAST IN MY OPINION I'M GONNA I'M GONNA REFER THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL QUESTIONS TO THOSE LOCK BECAUSE HE'S BEEN WORK MORE CAPABLE OF ANSWERING THAT THE MIND -- BELIEVED TO MY CONCEPT OF WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE INNOVATIONS GROUNDS. ON THE GROUNDS HAS BEEN REALLY A FACTOR THE COURTS WANT TO MOVE FORWARD -- TO MOVE FORWARD -- YOU KNOW AND THEN KIND OF CAN COULD KIND OF BE A MOP. OTHER JUDGES WILL COME IN SO I THINK THAT EXTENT -- WHAT'S HAPPENED HAPPENED RIGHT NOW -- HAS ALLOWED US THE COURTS TO MOVE FORWARD -- I'LL WORKERS WELL I'LL LET YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION IN A MINUTE BECAUSE I'M GONNA ASK A DIFFERENT. ONE AND THEN ARE YOU MAY -- OPINE ON BOTH BUT THE OTHER THING I'M INTERESTED IN IS. WHICH COLLABORATIVE COURTS HAVE THE HIGHEST CASELOADS. IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DO IT FOR US. OF THE D. Y. COURT I ESCAPE. OKAY -- BECAUSE WE HAVE STRUCTURED IT AS MAN. EVERY REPEAT YOU I OFFENDER IN IN MYCOUNTY IN OUR LARGEST. IN STOCK AND HOUSE TO GO IN UNDATED THEY CAN ASSESS THE GET TRAILER GET COUNT ABILITY MONITORING IN PLACE THEN WE EVEN IF NEEDED AND WE ABOUT WHEN WE EVALUATE THEM. SO ALEX PEAK I HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THERE WERE NOW DOWN TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED OR THREE HUNDRED AS IT WORKS THE FINDINGS AND EVERYTHING I'VE GONE DRAMATIC DOWN ON YOU ARE SITE BECAUSE WE BROUGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO PLAY. ON THE OTHER COURT DATE FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I THAT I IS GROWING IN IS THE COMING WAVE OF THE FUTURE IS MENTAL HEALTH BEHAVE. ALMOST ALL THE THROUGH US HAVE THESE TRAUMAS THAT ARE ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BASED ROCK KIND ALMONDS. AND IF WE REALLY WANT. TO BE A FACTOR WE NEED TO BRING BEHAVIOR HALL IN. BY THAT TREATMENT SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT I SEE -- BIGGEST NEED. A SEMI. FINAL QUESTION GRASS OF MY COLLEAGUES GOING IN. IS HOW IS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND YOU CAN ADDRESS THE OTHER QUESTION I MENTION BUT HOUSE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEASURING OUR COLLABORATIVE COURTS. AND IN THE CASE OF FOR EXAMPLE THE JUDGE JUST DESCRIBED THAT THE DO YOU I CORD IS MANDATORY SO WOULDN'T THAT BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE FUNDED DIRECTLY BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL VERSUS GRANTS. IN TERMS OF THE THE MEASUREMENTS AND KNOW THAT THE INNOVATIONS GRANT FUNDING DOES HAVE A LOT OF DATA NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE ITS OF THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S VIABILITY GOING FORWARD -- UNDER TO WHAT EXTENT -- JUDGE CAN SPEAK TO THROUGH THE INTERACTIONS OF THE OTHER ADVISORY COMMITTEES WHAT KIND OF DATA IS BEEN GATHERED AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING AT YOUR CORD -- CPARS IF MEASURING THE FACT THAT THE REASON I ASKED IF I WAS ASKING WITH THE JUDICIAL. AS WHEN I'M TRYING TO GET AT IS. HOW MUCH ARE WE TREATING THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IN A WAY EVEN IF IT'S IN FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE JURISDICTIONS HOW MUCH ARE WE READING THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT SELECTIVE? AND HOW MUCH IS THAT A PRIORITY NO I UNDERSTAND AND AT THIS POINT -- AREN'T SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS THE EACH COUNTY DOES HAVE IT GETS ITS ALLOCATION AND AND IS -- THE JUDGES DISCUSSED -- THEY ARE ORTIZ AND ALSO THE NEEDS IN THE OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY -- AND ALSO THE AVAILABILITY OF THE RESOURCES BY THE LOCAL JUSTICE PARTNERS IT WAS A STATE ONES. THAT WAS DONE AWHILE BACK ON ON THE DRUG FORCE HIMSELF. ON THERE HAS NOT REALLY BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM IS. IS REALLY KIND ARE THERE'S DIFFERENT WORDS ARE TARGETING. PROBLEM. SO IF YOU HAVE A HOME COURT RECIDIVISM ISN'T NECESSARILY -- THE FACT THAT THEY'RE LOOKING OUT THERE LOOKING AT CONNECTIONS OF SERVICES ANOTHER KIND. IF YOU HAVE A DEPENDENCY COURT ON YOU'RE NOT LOOKING IN OR STANDING AS AN ACTOR OUTCOME YOU'RE LOOKING AT UT REUNIFICATION AND THEN BEING ABLE BECAUSE I IF YOU HAVE A BROTHER OR OR DO YOU LIKE WORK YOU'RE LOOKING AT RECIDIVIST MEASURE OUTCOME. TO DIFFERENT COURTS HAVE DIFFERENT GOALS AND OUTCOMES SO IT'S NOT REAL EASY DO THAT WHOLE THING. ON THE DO YOU I CORPS -- THAT ONE THING IS I'VE BEEN INVITED TO MENTION EARLIER THE FUNDING WE GOT WE GOT. STARTED INITIATE THE D. Y. COURT WE USED NATIONAL HIGHWAY SAFETY ADMINISTRATION ALL ARE. EIGHT OPS -- THEY STARTED IT AND THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO FUNDED -- NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION. IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE MONITORING SIDE THE ACCOUNTABILITY SO. I'M MY COLLEAGUES. MANAGER THANK YOU JUDGE -- MY PRIOR. LIFE CAREER I WAS SUPERVISOR COUNTY OF ORANGE -- THE NO JUSTICE CORDONING COMMITTEE SO I A LOT OF FUN WORKING WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE IN THE JUVENILE. JUDGE AND AND THEN IT WAS ALSO. INVITED TO ATTEND TO YOUR WIFE GRADUATIONS WHICH WERE REALLY IMPRESSIVE [inaudible] AND ALSO GOT TO WATCH -- JUDGE WINDY LINDLEY WHO DID A WHATEVER IT TAKES COURT AND MY ROLE MODELS CHOOSING WAS INCREDIBLE I WHEN SHE RETIRED TWENTY FOURTEEN I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED BUT FOR HER IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS THE MATCH IT WAS THAT WAS. BUT SHE WAS BUILT FOR THIS. TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE COURT AND SHE JUST REALLY SET THE BAR I'M. BUT I'M JUST SORT OF A CURIOUS HE DECIDED TO WORKING IN A AND I'VE OBSERVED IT AND I'VE BEEN REAL IMPRESSED -- ONE OF THE THINGS I ALSO DID WAS. RIGHT TO BRING IN LAURA'S LAW INTO IN ORANGE COUNTY NOW IT'S IN ABOUT TWENTY COUNTIES. AND WOULD LAURA'S LAW FALL UNDER THE ADULT MENTAL HEALTH COURTS. ON IT WOULD BE I MEAN IT JUST WOULDN'T BE PART OF THE MEMO. OR BUT THE CONCEPT. THE SOMETHING AWFUL FOR ME YEAH OKAY SO RIGHT NOW THEY'RE GOING TO JUST A REGULAR COURT ROOM [inaudible] THEN I'M. JUST KIND OF CURIOUS. AS YOU LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE WE JUST RECEIVED THE STUDY OUT OF VIRGINIA THAT LOOK AT LARGE LAW IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE CRITICISM THEY HAD IS THAT ONLY TWENTY CHINESE COUNTIES OF SIGNED UP. I THINK THAT THAT THE REST OF THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING IT SO. I'M JUST WONDERING HOW THE COURTS MAYBE THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS ARE THEY ENCOURAGE COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS TO ADOPT LAURA'S LAW. NOW WE'RE ONE OF THE COUNTIES AND HAS -- A SHOW AND YOU KNOW IT IS AS THOUGH HAVE ETHICAL. WE CAN'T GO OUT IN PUBLIC. REPORTER MEETING LAW IN CASES LIKE THAT AFTERNOON TEA AFTER -- BUYER YEAH I DO SEE THE ONE THAT -- US OF THE ANIMATED SERIES THAT YEAH. HEY WAIT A MINUTE -- YOU SHALL. CAREFUL ABOUT HOW HOW WE CAN DO THAT WE CAN BRING PEOPLE ABLE BUT ADVOCACY IS NOT BEING. A BIG. SO I'LL TRY TO TRADE THAT LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT MAYBE YOU COULD. CONSIDER NOT BEING OPPOSITIONAL. WHEN THE IDEAS ARE DISCUSSED? WITH YOUR SUPERVISORS. HOW ELSE -- YES I WOULD YEAH INTO A I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE SUPERVISORS TO DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT WORKS THAT WORKS AND THAT'S WHAT CLUB OF COURTS ARE ALL ABOUT. ABOUT GETTING EVERYBODY AROUND A TABLE AND DESIGN A SYSTEM THAT WORKS AND THEN. COLLABORATING EVERYBODY WORKING WORKING TOGETHER MAKE THAT SYSTEM WORK IN THE IN THE CLUB RECORD SYSTEM THE JUDGE JUST KIND OF BRINGS PEOPLE TO THE TABLE. AND I LIVE OVERSEAS. YEAH BECAUSE THIS. IMP REFERRING BACK TO JUDGE LEN LEAVES IT SOME WITH A SPECIAL SKILL SET THAT CAN REALLY. BECAUSE I WATCH DASH I WATCH YOU DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. SESSION FOR HOMELESS AT THE ORANGE COUNTY HOMELESS SHELTER ARE. ALMOST. THE MISSION OR CAN. AND I WAS AMAZED AT HOW WELL. THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONDED TO HER IN THE IN THAT MAKESHIFT COURTROOM IT WAS IT WAS AMAZING SO. HOW DO HOW DO I AS A SENATOR HELP YOU AND HOW TO HOW DO WE? GIVE YOU MORE SUPPORT. WE HAVE A WE JUST HAVE TO ENCOURAGE AND ENABLE JUDGES WHO WANT TO DO THAT. SO THE WAY THE WAY I ENVISION IT IS I DIVIDE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN TWO PARK. ARREST INTERCEPTS THAT PART PRETTY MUCH THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED. FOR BUT THEN ONCE YOU GET THE SENTENCE IMPOSED FOR NEEDS TO BE ANOTHER PART OF THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT. WHERE THE COURTS WORK WITH PROBATION COMMUNITY SUPERVISION TO MAKE THE SUPERVISION OF FACT OF ON ON THE BATTERY -- AND THERE ARE JUDGES IN THE JUDGE'S YOU'RE DISCREET YOU'RE DESCRIBING LIKE THE JUDGE LINLEY -- LET THEM GO ON THAT -- LET THEM BE THERE LISTEN LET'S LET THEM TAKE THAT AND LET THEM GO WITH IT WILL BE EFFECTIVE AND IT'LL HELP EVERYBODY OUT. SO YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THOUGH ON THE KEY IS I ONCE HEARD WHEN I WAS A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE I WAS AT A CONFERENCE IN. THE SPEAKER WAS TALKING ABOUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM HE SAID WE USED IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM DESCRIBED THE THREE EIGHTHS ATTENDANT TO DOCUMENT ANY CHEAP. WE'VE DONE ALL THE RESEARCH AND YOU CAN GROW TO A CELL. YOU CAN THROW TENANTS OUT YOU CAN THROW CHEAP IF YOU GET ATTACHMENT AT BOTH OF THOSE OTHERS WILL. YOU GO AND THE SAME IS TRUE ON THE SUPERVISION SIDE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING WITH JUDGE LINDLEY'S ABILITY TO GET ATTACHMENT. ON AND IF YOU HAVE A JUDGE YOU CAN GET A CAT GET THAT ATTACHMENT WITH CLIENTS THEY WILLDO L. ALMOST ANYTHING FOR YOU -- TYPE OF THING SO -- THEY DO THEY COME UP TO YOU TO RESPOND YOU THEY COME TO COURT MY MENTAL HEALTH COURT RIGHT NOW. I HAVE IT'S SO FULL. I'VE GOT AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE. ALL I HAVE TO BE SEVERELY EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED. BUT THE TRAUMA. FOR AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE SYSTEM IS STRUCTURED ACE MAN AND EVERYBODY THEY GET OUT OF TOUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU SENATOR ABOUT -- WELL [inaudible] QUESTION ON THE WITH WITH THE INNOVATIONS FUNDING THEY HAVE THEY HAVE THE BEACH COUNCIL'S BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF US WITH THAT. HOW THAT WORKS [inaudible] I RESPECT -- AND CENTER ABOUT THE THE FUNDING FORMULA -- DOES NOT -- ENCOURAGE OR DISCOURAGE ANY PARTICULAR PROGRAM TO BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED IS THAT AVAILABLE FOR LOCAL PRIORITIES. AND LOCAL NEEDS. TO BE DETERMINED BY EACH COURT AND SO HISTORICALLY FOR COURT HAS BEEN I'M USING THE FUNDS FOR THESE COLLABORATIVE COURTS THEN THEY WOULD CONTINUE TO AIR MARK THOSE FUNDS ONCE RECEIVED. THE THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY TWO THERE ARE TWO THAT PROGRAM -- THE FUNDING FOR THERE IS REFLECTIVE OF THE FILINGS THAT THE COURTS RECEIVED -- AS THE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION AND SO. YEAH BASED ON THE FILINGS MY RECORD. RIGHT THERE THERE FOR THAT WOULD BE A LOCAL DECISION TO INVEST THOSE RESOURCES FOR THE NEEDS I ALSO. FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE. OR NOT AND I AND I THINK WE WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE SUPPORT THAT THE COUNCIL PROVIDES. I TAKE IT [inaudible] OF RESEARCH. IT SHOULD BE HERE OUR KIDS. CORRECT FROM THE BASE RESOURCES BUT ARE THE OTHERS. CENTER IF IF I COULD JUMP IN I'M SHELLEY CROWNED THE DIRECTOR OF THE COUNCIL'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES OFFICE -- THROUGH THE CHAIR PLEASE. MA'AM -- GOOD MORNING. SO. THE THAT WHAT THE COUNCIL THE SO THE COUNCIL HAS A AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE A STANDING ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- THE COLLABORATIVE JUSTICE COURTS ADVISORY COMMITTEE AND SELL -- IT CAN IT DOES A COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND SUPPORTING COURTS AS THEY ESTABLISH COLLABORATIVE TOWARDS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE DOES IS -- LOOKS FOR FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES -- LOOKS FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO TO REPLICATE BEST PRACTICES HAS A LOT OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH -- NATIONAL EXPERTS AROUND COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND PRIORITIZE IS THAT SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT THE AT THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE DOES. SOME OF IT IS BASED ON GRANTS AND BUT NOT ON A FORMULA EXCEPT THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL DOES IS WORKS WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE -- DIFFERENT TO IDENTIFY FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN THE LEGISLATURE WORKED WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND CREATED THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FUND? COURT GRANT PROGRAM THAT WOULD THAT FUNDED SEVERAL COLLABORATIVE COURTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THAT WAS A VARIETY OF REENTRY COURTS IN MENTAL HEALTH COURTS. IT WAS A GRANT PROGRAM YES. A READER FOR YOUR STILL THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE BASE FOR OTHERS. DOESN'T REFLECT ANY KIND OF PRAIRIE POOLS OR IT'S STRICTLY -- OUR PRIMARY. IT IS. IT IS ABOUT THE THE FILINGS THAT ARE RECEIVED BY THE COURTS. ALL RIGHT I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW YOU DO YOUR FORMULA. IN TERMS OF BY BY NOT EMPHASIZING CLEVER MARGIN IN YOUR YOU FOR SUCH A CLEVER. OKAY SO THAT'S MY PROPOSITION TO YOU THAT YOUR ONLY FINDING. TOWARDS THE ANY KIND OF RANCID YOU CAN PICK UP THE THEIR FIRST STATEMENT. I DON'T I MEAN I THINK THE COUNCIL HAS A COMMITMENT IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT OF CLUB OF COURTS AT THEIR CHOSEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS -- IS CURRENT AS AS DSCRIBED -- FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR THE TRIAL COURTS TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS ON ONE OF THE LOCAL NEEDS FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. YES THE JOB AND THE DATE THE MAYBE THE COMMITTEE PROVIDES SUPPORT TERMS OF EDUCATION AND CONFERENCES. NETWORKING THAT THAT KIND WORDS DUMP UP THROUGH THE COUNCIL BUT BY THE COMMITTEE. I'M IN THE INDIVIDUAL CORDS -- PART OF IT IS. COURTS ARE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT -- KIND OF KIND OF STRUCTURES AND THEN IT ONE THING IS IS YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE THE COURT STRUCTURE SO ONE THING I WOULD KIND OF MAYBE DISAGREE WITH. AND I HAD THIS CONVERSATION -- BOB THE COURTS ARE MORE COSTLY. AT THE START. THEY SAVE MONEY DOWN THE LINE SO I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE SAID IT NO WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES IT'S TIME TO DO IT NOW. DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TAUGHT NOT TO DO -- BECAUSE EVERYBODY WERE PREVENTED FROM COMING BACK BUT IT'S A IF THAT IS A LONG TERM VISION AND WE AS GLOBS OF COURSE NEED TO SHOW THE DATA -- WITH DRUG THROUGH THE RESEARCH THROUGH OUR OUTCOMES WISH WE COULD SHOW THE DATA ON MY DO YOU I COURT WE'RE GETTING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS -- AND SHOULD COME ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW THE RESEARCHERS DOING A THREE YEAR PROJECT ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW WHILE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS ON THE D. ON THE DO YOU I OR THEN WE CAN MAKE SOME REALLY INTELLIGENT SO. WE KIND OF HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE. EVALUATION AND AND DATA -- THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE THE INVESTMENT IN THOSE SOURCES. THE JUDGE I HA ANOTHER QUESTION FOR YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING HERE FOR THE SEX I THINK YOU'VE BEEN HERE A FEW TIMES. WITH US AND YOU KNOW -- YOU KNOW YOU'RE A TREASURE TROVE. INFORMATION FOR US. OF I HEAR THAT OTHER STATES HAVE A MODELS THAT. HAVE -- OR ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS ARE PROCESSES. TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE LOWER LEVEL -- OFFENDERS OR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE COURTS AND THEY THEY DO -- PRE ARREST VERSIONS OF SUCH AS WE TALK TO BE OUT WITH MY SP WANTS. TO FIFTEEN LAST YEAR WE GOT. SIGNED INTO LAW AND THOSE KINDS OF PROCESSES THAT ARE LIKE -- IN MINISTRY OF LESS FORMAL -- PROCESSES -- WHICH CAN BE USED -- TO REMOVE PEOPLE FROM YOUR CALENDAR IMPORTANT READ MORE QUICKLY AND DIRECTLY INTO. LIKE. THREE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS DO YOU HAVE ANY GERMANY MODELS THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST. OR IN THAT AREA ABSOLUTELY -- THE LEAD MARKS THE LEAD PROGRAM OUT OF SEATTLE. IS PROBABLY PROBABLY THE DEFENSE OF YOUR TALK ABOUT. JAN I'M ACTUALLY FLEX PEOPLE OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO YOU NEVER EVEN HAD IT -- LEAD IN SEATTLE AND THERE'S A SKIER ROSE PROGRAM YES THERE'S A SPEAR PROGRAM IN. YES YOUR PROGRAM IN MARYLAND WHAT DATE DID PROGRAM IS IN THAT PRIMARILY TOWARDS HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS OR NO. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SEATTLE'S PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY ORIENTED THAT NOW IT'S IT'S LOW LEVELS LIKE SUBSTANCE ABUSE OFFENSE WELL THEY THEY DON'T THEY DON'T RESTRICTED TO JUST THAT -- IF THE OFFICER COMES ACROSS SOME SOMEBODY THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INSTEAD OF SIDING ARRESTING THEM -- CONNECT WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION TURNING OVER THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION AND THEN AT THE CBO IF GO IF THEY GO THROUGH THE INTAKE WITH THE C. B. L.. D. A DOZEN FILED A DOZEN FILED A CHARGE ON DOES YOUR PROGRAM IN MARYLAND IT IS THE SAME R. D. A. IN OUR COUNTY IS STARTING TO PUT THAT TOGETHER I'M A PILOT PROJECT IN THERE WERE THE OFFICERS SO THE REALLY FREQUENT FLYERS WE JUST. STEP TAKEN TO JAIL WE JUST TAKE THE MARK JUST ELIVERED RIGHT TO THIS RIGHT TO THE SERVICE GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO STAY OUT OF THE SYSTEM. SO THOSE ARE THE TWO PROGRAMS THAT I THAT I AM AWARE OF IN NOW AND THEY'RE BOTH -- RESEARCH NATTEN NATIONALLY ON AFTER A TEN RIGHT NOW AND I THINK WOULD BE. RIGHT WE COMPLETE GOT I WENT TO SEATTLE WITH R. D. A. AND WE COMPLETELY OR THE CONCEPT OF BEING ABLE TO STIR CASES OUT OF COURT. I TRIED LIKE -- YOU TO ASSIST THE COMMITTEE AND HELP US A RISK EXPLORER. ANY ON ALL OPTIONS -- THAT WE CAN CONSIDER IN THAT REGARD BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT -- OF THOSE KINDS OPTIONS RENEWED IN CALIFORNIA I HAVE A BIG EMPTY HOLE WE NEED. TO THE SET UP OF IN ADDITION TO THE BARBER QUARTERS WHEN I'M NOT LOOKING TO REPLACE. BUT WHAT WE OF THE MORE -- IN ADDITION TO THE CLEVER COURTS AND CALIFORNIA -- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT I THINK IT LEADS TO WAR INCARCERATION -- IN AS A WAY WE CAN -- A SPECIALLY -- IS THEIR PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OR USE JUVENILES IN THIS AREA YES SOME OF SOME OF THE COURTS DID DID YOU'VE SEEN ARE ON THE LIST ARE OUR JUVENILE COURTS. I'M EVEN GOLD EVEN GO ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TURN TO COURT IS THE INNER EARLIER YOU ANYTHING BETTER I GETA TRUE. ART WHEN I WAS A JUVENILE COURT JUDGE THE REALLY WENT OUT TO A SCHOOL WE HAVE THE LITTLE COURT SESSION IN THE SCHOOL WITH. THE VIGIL TRUANT SAY THEY HAD TO COME BACK AND CHECK IN WITH THE JUDGE -- IN THIS VERY EFFECTIVE WE HAVE TRUANCY COURTS IN THE STATE THAT'S A NATIONAL PROCESS -- WE DO HAVE SOME CLOUDS. THEY'RE ON THEIR ON THE LIST FOR FOR JUVENILES BOTH ON THE MENTAL SIDE AND ON SUBSTANCE YOU'RE LOOKING -- FOR SURE THESE PRE ARREST TYPE OF ADMINISTRATIVE THINGS -- FOR FOR FOR THE FRUIT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU COULD SAY PRE ARREST BUT PRE COURT FILING -- THERE IS THIS ENTIRE STRUCTURE ON THE JUVENILE SIDE WERE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO TAKE THE LOWER LEVEL CASES AND DEAL WITH THEM ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT EVEN WERE. BURNING IT TO THE COURT -- SO THERE'S THIS WHOLE ARM. ARM OF PROBATION AND IN THE JUNE THAT I WAS HAPPY TOTALLY UNAWARE OF UNTIL I WENT THERE OUT OUT AS A JUDGE OH BABY SHOULD ACTUALLY KEEPS MOST CASES OUT OF THE SYSTEM. LAST YEAR WE PASSED A LAW THAT EXTENDED THE AGE FOR THE PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION. TO AGE TWENTY FIVE FOR THE JUVENILE CORRECTION FACILITIES. AND THERE ARE -- PEOPLE THAT WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND THE AGE FOR COUNTY CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES THE FIVE ALSO. OF DO YOU HAVE AN OPINION ABOUT THAT. NOT WE HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE JUVENILE UP WORLD FOR AWHILE FOR A WHILE SO I'M I WOULD PROBABLY WANT TO SIT DOWNS KIND GET A GAUGE WHERE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS NOW -- BEFORE ANSWERED THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU -- SENATOR BELL PRECIADO THE RAISING OF THE PRE ARREST A DIVERSION WHICH OF COURSE AS THE JUDGE DESCRIBED [inaudible] DOESN'T NECESSARILY INVOLVE OUR COURTS I SUPPOSE IT COULD BUT IN THE MODELS THAT WERE REFERENCED THERE MOSTLY A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND DA TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP. I'M RETURNING FOR A MOMENT BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION ON COLLABORATIVE COURTS. I APPRECIATE THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH AS A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT IN FACT THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS WERE BEGUN BY -- ONE OF OUR CHIEF JUSTICE I BELIEVE WAS RUN BUT IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT ONLY THROUGH FINDING. BUT THROUGH VARIOUS -- BILLS PASSED. OF COMMUNICATED A PRETTY HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST AND PRIORITY ME THAT WELL DIRECTION. TOWARDS THE BENEFIT IN NEED FOR THESE. AND SO I AM PART OF MY INTEREST IN HAVING THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING WAS. TO REALLY GET INTO SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND SUCH. AND ALSO WHETHER THIS IS LEFT JUST. TO THE THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS ABILITY TO GO GET GRANTS EVEN IF WE ARE JUDICIAL COUNCILS FINDING THEM AND HOW MUCH IT IS A PRIORITY OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SO I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE CS ACTION. ON BUT I THINK THAT WELL IT'S FAIR TO SAY EACH. A JURISDICTION EACH CHORD IS UNIQUE. THE STATE DOES STILL HAVE AN OVERRIDING OBJECTIVE AND STILL APPROACH CAN APPROPRIATELY DIRECT THAT SUCH THINGS HAPPEN STATEWIDE. SO -- WE WE WILL OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION. BUT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE. ALRIGHT WE'LL GO TO OUR ON ONE SECOND A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. AND SINCE WE WILL BE REVISITING THIS ISSUE AT THAT POINT ALL OBVIOUSLY ES LA OVER YEAH. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF NAS YOUR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS ARE COLONEL JUSTICE. STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION FROM DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND WORK IN PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES WE DO SUPPORT -- THE CONCEPT OF A COLLABORATIVE COURTS WOULD YOU SUPPORT -- THE TONE OF THE DISCUSSION TO MAKE IT MORE OF A PRIORITY STATEWIDE -- WITH -- GREATER FUNDING AND MORE DEDICATED FUNNY ESPECIALLY FROM THE STATE -- AS OPPOSED TO RELYING ON FEDERAL GRANTS SO WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THIS COLLABORATIVE COURTS. I WOULD OUR TERMS OF SEEN ON THE GROUND IS SIX EXTREME EFFECTIVENESS OF COLLABORATIVE COURSE SPECIALLY IF THEY'RE DONE A CERTAIN WAY -- I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS ESPECIALLY FOR D. Y. COURTS -- WE HAVE FOUND SOME RESISTANCE IN A NUMBER OF COUNTIES AND IMPLEMENTING -- DO I COLLABORATIVE COURTS I'M ALSO EVEN A LITTLE WHILE I THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THAT WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH SOME. VETERANS COURTS NOT WANTING TO TAKE UP TO YOU I CASES -- BUT NOW IT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE WIDESPREAD LOVE IT MORE OPEN SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT DEFINITELY NEED TO BE EXPANDED. I'M A KEEP IN MIND THERE IS A NETWORK OF SERVICES THEY NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THESE COLLABORATIVE COURTS ARE EFFECTIVE THE SAME WAY DRUG. DIVERSION PROGRAMS -- RAN INTO PROBLEMS WHEN THERE WAS ENOUGH FUNDING FOR FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. THE SAME CAN BE SAID OF DO YOU WHY -- AND ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT IN CALIFORNIA STATISTICS. ARE JUST JUST AROUND 50% OF ALL D. Y.. ARRESTS IN CALIFORNIA OR LATINO DRIVERS AND THAT HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU I COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AVAILABLE IN THOSE COUNTIES -- WITH HIGH POPULATION LATINO COMMUNITY AND ALSO THERE AT THE CULTURALLY SENSITIVE RELEVANT AND ACCESSIBLE ON SO LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART OF THAT DISCUSSION IN TRYING TO STRENGTHEN ALL COLLABORATIVE COURTS BUT IN PARTICULAR THAT YOU LIKE WORDS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. ALL RIGHT WILL MOVE TO OUR NEXT ITEM WHICH IS OVERSIGHT OF THE TRIAL COURT'S FINDING. AND WE HAVE -- MR THEATER ROBIC OF COURSE AND JOHN WORD LAW FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS A CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND WE I BELIEVE ALSO MICHAEL RODDY.

I REALLY DO MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH TO ADD. I'M REALLY MORE ANTICIPATING THE QUESTIONS AND GETTING INTO THE FIX BUT I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT -- THE TRIAL COURT'S. REALLY DID APPRECIATE. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WERE ADDED INTO THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR -- ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT THE YEAR BEFORE THERE WAS VIRTUALLY NO MONEY PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR OPERATIONS SO -- YOUR WORDS WITH THIS MONEY EXPECTING THT WE WILL BE REPORTING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. ON THE OUTCOMES -- THAT WERE ACHIEVED BY DECEMBER OF SEVENTY FIVE MILLION -- AT A VERY BROAD LEVEL I TELL YOU THAT -- FORTY THREE OF OUR PORCH I HAVE USED THE FUNDS -- THIRTY OF OUR COURTS HAVE USED THE MONEY FOR SALARY AND COMPENSATION INCREASES -- THAT ARE OVERDUE. A TWENTY THREE OF OUR COURTS HAVE. THE MONEY IN THE RECORDS MANAGEMENT AND KATE. BUT SOME UPGRADES. TWENTY TWO COURTS HAVE EXTENDED SERVICE HOURS AND PUBLIC ACCESS. AND TWENTY ONE COURTS HAVE -- UNDER THE MISCELLANEOUS TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT AREA THAT IS REPLACING EQUIPMENT. AGED INFRASTRUCTURE -- THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT -- WE CAN ADEQUATELY PROVIDE SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC SO -- AS EACH COURT IS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE -- COMING OUT OF THE RECESSION COMING OUT OF PRIOR REDUCTIONS. ON THIS DISCRETIONARY MONEY IS GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO RESTORE SERVICES THAT ARE IMPORTANT IN THE COMMUNITY I CAN. GET VERY SPECIFIC AS TO SAN DIEGO BUT BUT I THINK THE BROAD PICTURE IS WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT HERE SO. AGAIN I'M VERY INTERESTED THE QUESTION. WOULD BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THOSE AS WE GO THROUGH. I'M SO BUT MAYBE -- FOR WELL THIS IS A QUESTION BEFORE WE GET INTO THE OTHER DETAIL QUESTIONS. I'M. MR WORD LIKE COULD YOU. THIS IS AN OVERSIGHT AND SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ALL THE BCP'S BEFORE US BUT COULD YOU GIVE US A HEADS UP ON SOME OF THE REQUESTS THAT -- DID YOU JUST -- COUNCIL BE MAKING FOR THE TRIAL COURTS FOR US TO CONSIDER THIS COMING YEAR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M SO WE HAVE A SERIES OF PROPOSALS. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS FOR A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD A MULTI YEAR DEPLOYMENT OF OUR CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE PURPOSE BEHIND THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IS. TO ENABLE FOR DATA COLLECTION AT A STATE WIDE MACRO LEVEL AND WITH THE THIS FINAL PUSH FOR TEN ADDITIONAL CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL ENABLE ON THE BRANCH AS A WHOLE. TO START REALIZING THE VISION ADA A DATA ANALYTICS AND SO CASE MANAGE VERY IMPORTANT TO US. THAT REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY THREE MILLION. UP WE'RE REQUESTING -- FOR ARE. OUR OUR PHOENIX SYSTEM THAT'S A AN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM USED BY THE TRIAL COURT -- FOR PERIL PURPOSES -- THAT SYSTEM IS COMING TO AN END OF LIFE AND SO WE ARE ASKING -- FOR THE FUNDS TO BEGIN -- THE TRANSIENT TRANSITIONING AND UPGRADING OF THAT SYSTEM TO MAINTAIN THAT VITAL FUNCTION FOR US. WE'RE ASKING -- FOR RESOURCE IS RELATIVE TO FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS OUGHT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS FACILITY MODIFICATIONS NECESSARY IN THE VARIOUS COURT HOUSES THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THAT REQUEST IS TWENTY POINT ONE MILLION. AS WELL AS A VARIETY OF SECURITY SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT THE COURT OF THAT NEED TO BE UPGRADED THAT REQUEST IS FOUR SIX MILLION. WERE ASKING FOR RESOURCES FOR THE PURPOSES OF DIGITIZING DOCUMENTS WE HAVE LITERALLY WAREHOUSES OF COURT DOCUMENTS AND RECORDS THAT -- WE WE IN IN THE DENTURE LAYS AGE WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT TO TO HAVE AN ELECTRONIC MEANS THAT WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION -- BETWEEN COURTS. WE'RE ASKING FOR RESOURCES RELATIVE TO THE LITIGATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO THE TUNE OF FIVE POINT SIX MILLION. WE'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES RELATIVE TO A DATA ANALYTICS -- THE DESIRE IS ONCE WE HAVE THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS ARE IN PLACE THERE IS A NEED NOW TO START TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE DATA -- EXPERTISE WITHIN THAT THAT THE BRANCH TO ACTUALLY EXTRACT THE INFORMATION FOR POLICY MAKERS. WITH RESPECT TO THE CANNABIS CONVICTIONS WERE REQUESTING THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION ARM AS THE THE CHANGES IN LOG -- RELATIVE TO CANNABIS WE'RE SEEING A HUGE A LARGE LARGE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND SO THE FUNDS TO SUPPORT OF THAT WORK LOAD WHEN YOU SAY THAT YOU MEAN FOR EXPUNGEMENT AROUND THE CANNABIS CONVICTIONS CORRECT SENATOR. YES MA'AM MILLER FOR KAY AND NOW HAS EXPUNGEMENT STATEWIDE OR SPECIFIC COURTS -- IT THAT WOULD BE STATEWIDE MANAGER. YEAH GO AHEAD AND SO ON OUR OUR OUR PRIMARY -- REQUESTS -- WE ALSO HAVE. IT'S NOT REPRESENTED IN A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL BUT WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS. STATEWIDE OUT MADAM CHAIR ON DURING OUR HEIGHTS OF CLAIMS. WE WERE IN NEED OF APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY JUDGES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND TEN THAT REPRESENTED A CASELOAD OF ABOUT. ARMED. TO THE LEGISLATURE WE WERE AUTHORIZED AND FUNDED FOR FIFTY JUDGESHIPS IN. TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY BUT DID NOT FIND THOSE JUDGESHIPS. AS YOU'LL RECALL -- IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL TWO JUDGES -- SO LEAVING FORTY EIGHT JUDGESHIPS ON FUNDED AT THIS POINT. OUR LATEST PROJECTIONS BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN ALL FOR AN OVERALL NEED OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN JUDGESHIPS. AT THESE ARE JUDGES. JUDGESHIPS IN COURTS THAT HAVE FILINGS THAT ARE ABOVE THE CAPACITY OF THAT PARTICULAR COURT'S ABILITY TO THE PROCESS TIMELY -- REPRESENTING ABOUT FOUR IN FILINGS ARE PRUDENT REQUEST THIS POINT A MAN I'M SURE WOULD BE -- FOR TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS. AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY THREE SIX POINT FIVE MILLION. THANK YOU SO [inaudible] ON THE JUDGESHIP QUESTION. YOU MENTIONED THAT IN. TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND AND SIX I'M. FIFTY WERE AUTHORIZED AND FUNDED. OF THE FIFTY IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WERE THEY ALL WOULD. WERE FIFTEEN YOUR JUDGES INSTALLED. YES THE THE FIFTY JUDGES WERE INSTALLED STATEWIDE MA'AM THERE THEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN YOU DESCRIBED THAT THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED ANOTHER FIFTY BUT DIDN'T FIND THEM. CORRECT MADAM CHAIR OKAY SO. SINCE THEN. WERE ANY ANY OF THOSE FIFTY FUNDED. WE LIVE IN THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET TO A JUDGESHIP FOR RIVERSIDE WERE FUNDED RIGHT SO TOO WERE FUNDED OUT OF THAT -- NEED. THAT WAS IT THE BY THE LEGISLATURE OF A FIFTH OF FIFTY BACK THEN AND OBVIOUSLY OUR POPULATION GONE UP SUBSEQUENTLY I'M. A. N. AND NOW. THERE'S DISCUSSION BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL FOR A REQUEST FOR AN ID. FOR I WON'T CALL IT AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY FIVE BUT RATHER TO FIND. TWENTY FIVE THAT'S CORRECT MADAM CHAIR YES OKAY. ALL RIGHT NOW I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MONEY WE GAVE YOU LAST YEAR AND FOR THE COURT REPORTERS BUT BEFORE I GO INTO ALL OF THOSE MAYBE ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. WERE ALSO OKAY IT'S BETTER MORE LACK. SURE GO AHEAD [inaudible] I'M. IT'S JUST BEEN MY OBSERVATION OF THE PRIOR. THE ADMINISTRATION WAS NOT VERY. HELPFUL TO THE COURTS AND SO I'M WONDERING. WHAT YOU KIND OF? SEE AS A CHANGE OF CLIMATE I DON'T KNOW HOW TO ASK THE QUESTION DELICATELY BUT JUST. HOW ARE YOU IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION TO HELP MEET YOUR BUDGET? NEEDS. THANK YOU CENTER AND AND MADAM CHAIR OUT WITH RESPECT TO THAT QUESTION. YOU KNOW WE ARE AS I OPENED WITH GRATEFUL TO THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION FOR CONSIDERATION OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDING THAT IS REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR OUR POPULATIONS ACCESS TO JUSTICE. WE ARE ALSO ENJOYING A GOOD CONVERSATION WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION AS IT'S COMING IN WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT -- WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL NEEDS THAT WE WILL BE IN A POSITION OF OF HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU. THROUGH -- THE GOVERNOR'S CONSIDERATION OF OUR NEEDS. THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDS JUST CAME LAST YEAR. THAT WOULD BE CORRECT YOU YOU HAVE IN A SENSE WHITTLE DOWN ALL YOUR RESERVES. TO ZERO RIGHT YES AND AND AND THERE THERE IS ONE OTHER. PIECE OF THE PUZZLE. WE ARE RESTRICTED TO BEING 1% OF OF CORE EXPENDITURES -- YEAR OVER YEAR -- DATA A PIECE OF STATUTE THAT WE RESPECTFULLY WOULD ASK FOR A CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT POTENTIALLY. REMOVING THAT CAP TO ALLOW FOR OUR COURTS TO PLAN FOR MULTI YOUR SPENDING IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY CRIPPLING TO THE COURTS NOT TO BE ABLE TO PLAN. ON A MULTI YEAR BASIS -- AND SO WE DO ASK THAT THAT WITH RESPECT. WELL THAT WOULD BE GREAT I'D LIKE TO REMOVE THE APPS ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CLOSE TO WE CAN DO. I'D BE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM. THANK YOU SENATOR. I'M SO BEFORE I GOING. TO COURT REPORTERS AND OUR ALLOCATION OF FUNDING TO LAST YEAR WHEN WE DISTILL JUDGES FOR A LITTLE BIT LONGER -- SO CLEARLY THE LEGISLATURE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN FELT THAT FIFTY ADDITIONAL JUDGES WERE NEEDED. BUT DIDN'T FIND THEM AND PROBABLY WE COULD SAY MAYBE THAT WAS WHY IS. BECAUSE GIVEN THAT THE RECESSION WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER THEY'RE VERY WHAT A CUT THEM. BUT AND IT'S PROBABLY WHY. MORE HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED SENSE BECAUSE UP UNTIL YOU KNOW UNTIL. TWENTY FOURTEEN A NEW ALLOCATIONS TO MOST DEPARTMENTS WERE REALLY BEING MADE. I'M. BUT THAT SAID THINGS HAVE CHANGED A GREAT DEAL SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN OF THE FUNDS ONE LET IN THE COURTS SOME MORE RESPONSIBILITIES IN TERMS OF RE SENTENCING IN VARIOUS THINGS ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE CHANGED. A VARIETY OF LAWS WHERE PERHAPS THERE ARE. MORE OR LESS OF SET OF THINGS THAT USED TO COME BEFORE THE COURTS THAT AREN'T COMING BEFORE THE COURTS. SO I THINK CLEARLY AS REEVALUATE WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER. OF AND I'M NOT. I'M NOT GOING TO EVEN TRY. TO SPECULATE THAT WE COULD LAND EXACTLY ON WHAT WE THINK IS THE RIGHT NUMBER BUT AS WE TRY TO EVALUATE. WHAT IS? THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER FOR US TO AT THIS TIME FIND. I'M. IT MAY BE WORTH FACTORING IN SOME OF THOSE THINGS NOW IT'S A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN WE ADOPT THE BUDGET TO REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE VARIETY OF CHANGES SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN AND NOW BUT I'M HOPING THAT THE LA -- RATHER THAN IN ASKING YOU. TO DO. FIND UPON THAT NOW. THAT YOU MIGHT OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING TO BE THE P. C. PEAS IN THIS AREA. SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE. THAT WE MIGHT HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF OF ON KNOW WHETHER AN YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHANGES AND WHAT KIND OF NEW DEMANDS ARE ON THE COURTS THAT MIGHT. JUSTIFY EVEN ADDITIONAL JUDGES THAN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE. AND AGAIN NOT ASSERTING THAT WE WOULDNECESSARILY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FUND THE ADDITIONAL BUT OR OR WHETHER THERE'S A SENSE THAT ADDITIONAL ARE NOT NEEDED. JUST SO WE CAN KIND OF GRAPPLE WITH I MEAN ANY TIME WE ARE GIVEN. A PROPOSAL FOR YOU KNOW FIND EX NUMBER WHY NUMBER. IT'S GOOD FOR US TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW HOW WE LANDED ON THOSE NUMBERS. SO -- IF LA -- CAN NOW THINK ABOUT THAT IN TO SPEAK THAT AS WE GO INTO THAT DISCUSSION THE FUTURE I'M NOW [inaudible] LAST YEAR. WE PROVIDE IT. THE OUR JUDICIAL COUNCIL TEN MILLION. EXPLICITLY FOR COURT REPORTERS. AND MY UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT -- LESS THAN TEN MILLION OF THAT WENT. TO COURT REPORTERS. AND I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHY. WHY THE FULL TEN MILLION WAS NOT DISTRIBUTED FOR IT WASN'T? AND WHETHER IT WAS USED WHATEVER WAS DISTRIBUTED WEATHER WAS USED FOR COURT REPORTERS AS WAS OUR INTENTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WITH RESPECT TO THE COURT REPORTERS I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND IT'S DELIBERATION AND AND ARM ALLOCATION OF THOSE THAT TEN MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WAS SPECIFICALLY EXPLICITLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF COURT REPORTERS. THAT SAID TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT COURT REPORTERS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. WITHIN A LOCALE THEN HAD THE DISCRETION TO USE THOSE FUNDS AND AND DIFFERENT WAYS -- TO TO ENSURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE AGAIN I'LL STATE THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL EXPLICITLY. DIRECTED THAT THE MONEY IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF OF COURT REPORTERS. ALL TEN MILLION OF THAT. I WOULD LIKE. OUR REQUEST PERMISSION. FOR MICHAEL RODDY TO SHARE SOME EXPERIENCES THAT HE AND SOME OF THE OTHER COURTS ARE. WITH RESPECT TO RECRUITMENT OF THEIR COURT REPORTERS. GO HEAD TO HEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I CAN GIVE YOU OF MY COUNTY SPECIFIC EXPERIENCE -- WE NEEDED TO HIRE WE NEED TO HIRE TWENTY FIVE COURT REPORTERS. TO FULLY STAFF ALL OF OUR FAMILY ALL OPERATIONS AND TO FILL SOME PRE EXISTING VACANCIES. FROM RETIREMENTS OCCURRED IN MARCH OF LAST OF MARCH OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAVE HIRED NINETEEN REPORTERS. SO WE ARE WELL ON THE WAY. HOWEVER WE'VE EXHAUSTED THE HIRING LIST WE HAVE THREE NAMES REMAINING THOSE JUST HAVE JUST COME IN -- WE HAVE A SUBSEQUENTLY LOST TWELVE REPORTERS DUE TO RETIREMENTS AND RESIGNATION. SO AFTER HIRING NINETEEN REPORTERS I'M STILL EIGHTEEN REPORTER SHORT. WHAT I NEED TO BE? TELL I CAN REPORT TO YOU THAT WE'VE SPENT THE MONEY FOR THE PURPOSE INTENDED BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. OUR TOTAL COURT REPORTER EXPENDITURES ARE BASICALLY GOING TO BE A ZERO SUM GAME BECAUSE WE HAVE LOST THROUGH ATTRITION ALL OF THOSE POSITIONS. WE ARE ENCOUNTERING A SERIOUS SUPPLY DEMAND ISSUE -- SINCE JANUARY WE'VE HAD THREE APPLICANTS -- ADD TO THOSE APPLICANTS MAY NOT MAKE IT THROUGH THE FINAL AND ONE IS FROM NEW JERSEY SO -- AS FORECAST BY THE NATIONAL PARK REPORTERS ASSOCIATION IN -- TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE ARE SEEING AT LEAST IN OUR COUNTY AND AS I TALK WITH OTHER COUNTIES THEY ARE ALSO HAVING LOS ANGELES COUNTY'S HAVING ISSUES. WHICH COUNTIES LOSING REPORTERS. CAMERA DINOS HAD RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS ALL HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHY YET. FIND A MAN. AN ARC IN OUR OPINION WE WERE GETTING. MEAN. IT IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE LEAVING THE WORK FORCE OR AGING OUT -- WE HAVE FOLKS ARE GOING IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WHERE THEY CAN MAKE FAR MORE MONEY -- THE DEMAND FOR LEGAL SERVICES CONTINUES TO RISE ON THE PRIVATE SIDE. AND SO WE'RE JUST NOT GETTING THE APPLICANTS -- THAT WE NEED TO REPLENISH THE FOLKS THAT ARE LEAVING US. I LOST A TWELVE REPORTERS LAST YEAR TO RETIREMENT -- I WAS ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY GET FOR FIVE OR SIX AND WE CONTINUE TO HOLD THOSE BIG. THIS MARCH I'M I THINK I'M ALREADY UP TO ELEVEN OR TWELVE REPORTER. RETIRING. RETIREMENT INCENTIVES AFTER. EIGHT REACHING AGE SIXTY SIXTY FIVE AND TWENTY YEARS OF SERVICE. LEAVE THEM TO LEAVE THE COURT SO WE'RE NOT SEEING APPLICANTS COMING THROUGH -- FRANKLY IN REVIEWING -- INFORMATION. GOT A COURT REPORTER BOARDS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN THERE WERE. FORTY EIGHT FIRST TIME TEST TAKERS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OVER THE THREE EXAMS THAT WERE ADMINISTERED. TWENTY EIGHT OF THOSE. IN MY COURT ALONE I'VE LOST CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE COURT REPORTERS SO THEY'RE NOT BEING REPLACED AS QUICKLY AS THEY WERE LEAVING NOW LEAVING THE WORK FORCE -- GIVEN THAT WE HAVE [inaudible] WHAT? ALL SHORTAGE. I'M IS THERE. HAS THERE BEEN A A LOOK AT ALL ABOUT WHETHER ON WE SHOULD BE. RE EXAMINE RE LOOKING AT WHAT QUALIFICATIONS REAR REQUIRING OR WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING UNDER THE TEST. DOES IT. MEET OUR CURRENT NEEDS OR IS IT. A IS IT OUTDATED. I MEAN CLEARLY. YOU KNOW WE COULD LOOK AT SALARIES AND SUCH. BUT I'M IT COULD BE IT MAY NOT BE SALARIES ALONE THAT ARE THE REASON THAT WE'RE NOT BEING ABLE TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND I THINK GIVEN. THAT OUR COURTS NEED COURT REPORTERS TO FUNCTION ADEQUATELY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT IS LOOKED AT I'M SURE I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT ABOUT THE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT IS THE REASON IS THAT THE COURT REPORTERS AT THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING. OFF ON IT AND WORKING WITH THE COURT REPORTER BOARD. YOU KNOW THAT ENTITY SEEMS LIKE THE LIKELY PARTNER THAT WE WOULD NEED TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH YOU UNFORTUNATELY TODAY I'M NOT IN A POSITION TO TELL YOU SPECIFICALLY. THE STATUS OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU ARE HAVING THEM. I I I CANNOT SAY CONCLUSIVELY THE WHEN AND HOW OFTEN WERE HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS YEAH I KNOW THAT IT IS A PIECE OF THE DIALOGUE AMONGST THE CORE FAMILY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW FREQUENTLY WE'VE MET WITH THE BOARD ON THIS TOPIC THOUGH. RIGHT AND I MIGHT ADD THAT. FROM WHAT WE HAVE HEARD AND RECENT REPORTS. THERE ARE FEWER SCHOOLS. THERE ARE FAR FEWER PEOPLE COMING INTO THE PROFESSION. AND STAYING WITH THE PROFESSION. AND IT'S REACHED A POINT WHERE THEY'RE NOT ATTRACTING NEW. INTEREST AS QUICKLY AS PEOPLE ARE AGING OUT OF THE SYSTEM. AND AGAIN THIS WAS SOMETHING WAS FORECAST BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO -- IT'S HAPPENING -- TODAY. AND SO IF A HUNDRED PEOPLE EVEN ONLY FORTY EIGHT PEOPLE STEP UP TO TAKE THE TEST. THAT DEFICITS GONNA CONTINUE TO CLIMB OVER TIME THAT'S OUR CONCERN. BETTER MORE LUCK. I COULD JUMP INTO THIS DISCUSSION AND ASK YOUR STRANGE QUESTION BUT THIS THIS SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE REPLACED BY. VIDEO TAPES AND ALL THE REST SO. IS IT THAT WAY I WOULDN'T INCENTIVIZE ME TO WANT TO GO INTO A PROFESSION THAT COULD BE. ELIMINATED IN IN ONE BROAD SWEEP HOW DO YOU MOTIVATE PEOPLE TO BECOME COURT REPORTERS AND WHY DON'T WE TRANSITION OVER BUDGET BECAUSE OF BOLD AS TO ASK -- WE CAN'T TRANSITION OVER BECAUSE MY DECISION PERMITS US USE THEM FOR ALL BUT LIMITED PURPOSES -- AND WHILE FORTY EIGHT FIVE STATES INCLUDING SEVERAL COMPLETE STATE SYSTEMS USE OTHER TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS TO CAPTURE THE RECORD. WE ARE PROHIBITED HERE IN CALIFORNIA FROM USING THEM ALL. EXCEPT FOR MISDEMEANORS. A SMALL CLAIMS. TRAFFIC IN LIMITED CIVIL WHICH IS A SUBSET OF THE COURT. ALL JUVENILE FELONY FAMILY LAW PROBATE. REQUIRE AT THIS POINT OF THE STENOGRAPHIC REPORTER. SO JUST TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID YOU SAID THERE FOR FORTY EIGHT STATES THIRTY FIVE FORTY FIVE STATES THAT DO NOT USE. THAT. USE -- TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS LIKE VIDEO AND AUDIO OTHER THAN A COURT REPORTER IN A DELUXE OR ANOTHER THEN YES. FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE OF UTAH. TRANSITION COMPLETELY ELECTRONIC REPORTING IN THE STATE OF ALASKA. FOR DECADES HAS HAD THAT BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OR TRACK COURT ORDERS. OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA IS LARGELY CONVERTED OVER TO THE STATE OF KENTUCKY -- FOR SEVERAL DECADES NOW SO THERE ARE EXAMPLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE THE TRANSITIONS OCCURRING - A COMPUTER CAN TRANSCRIBE. ME IS RIGHT RIGHT WHERE YOU'RE WATCHING IT ON ON THE SCREEN SO I'M. I'M WONDERING WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING [inaudible] TO PHIL. EMPLOYEES POSITIONS WERE WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT LEGISLATION TO TRANSFER OVER ON A LIMITED BASIS TO SEE HOW IT. ACTUALLY WORKS I THINK WE WOULD WELCOME THAT -- I KNOW THERE WAS A PILOT PROGRAM IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES. WITH A REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE -- THAT DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE -- AT FROM A POOR EXECUTIVE STANDPOINT WE WOULD REALLY LOVE TO REVISIT THAT ISSUE -- BUT IT'S GONNA REQUIRE BRINGING -- LOTS OF PARTIES TO THE TABLE AND COMING UP WITH A WORKABLE SOLUTION. THANK YOU AND I AM JUST IF I MAY ESTIMATES WERE OR WERE NOT ADVOCATING THAT WE WOULD WANT TO REPLACE THE COURT REPORTERS NECESSARILY WE THINK THAT THAT'S A DISCUSSION. THAT. TECHNOLOGY MAY BE VERY HELPFUL WITH RESPECT TO THIS THIS WORKLOAD ON BUT I DON'T I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR ON BEHALF OF THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE ARE NOT ADVOCATING ONE POLICY. OVER THE OTHER AT THIS PARTICULAR. POINT OUR INTEREST IS IN LOOKING AT ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS TO PRODUCE. APPROPRIATE COURT RECORDS. ARE INSTANCES WHERE A REPORTER WITH -- THE STENOGRAPHIC EQUIPMENT IS PROBABLY THE THE BEST OPTION AND THERE MAY BE OTHER TYPES HEARINGS WHERE -- TECHNOLOGY MAY BE AN OPTION. I WOULD ALSO POINT YOU TO THE CHIEF A RECENT FUTURES COMMISSION REPORT. WHERE THERE WAS EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION AND REVIEW OF OTHER TYPES OF? MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO HELP US ADDRESS THE CURRENT SUPPLY AND DEMAND ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO STENOGRAPHIC REPORTERS. THANK YOU MR ROBBIE I'M. I'M NOT TRYING. TO BE DIFFICULT BUT THESE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS I WOULD GET FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR EARLY. ON THE FACT THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FILL POSITIONS WORKFORCE QUESTIONS MAY NOT BE. THEY MAY NOT -- NECESSARILY LEGITIMATELY JUMP TO THAT WHICH YOU REPLACE IT WITH THE TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND WHAT IS IT THAT WE WHAT IS IT ROUND OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE POSITION THAT ARE SOMEHOW EXCLUDING US FROM HAVING A WORK FORCE THAT IS. AT IT ABLE TO FILL THESE POSITIONS AND PERHAPS THEN THERE CAN BE TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE TO THAT. BUT I THINK ANY OF US WHO HAVE WATCHED FOR EXAMPLE THE CAL CHANNEL. WHEN THERE'S A WILL YOU KNOW STILL WHEN WE VIDEO OUR OWN PROCEEDINGS ME WATCH? T. R.. THE COMPUTER TRANSCRIPTION OF THAT YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE THE SOUND ON WE KNOW THAT WHAT WE'RE HEARING. IS CAN BE VERY OFTEN DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THOSE WORDS ARE ON THE SCREEN AND SO CERTAINLY IF WE'RE RELYING. IN TERMS OF A COURT PROCEEDING. FOR ACCURACY WE NEED THE YOU KNOW WE PROBABLY. WHATEVER THEIR NEEDS IT'S THE THINK OF WE WANNA MAKE SURE THERE'S ACCURACY. AND SO THERE MAY BE. TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN ASSESS. BUT THEY MAY NOT BE. OPTIMAL FOR REPLACEMENT SO I I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THE OTHER ISSUES ARE. THAT ARE AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO FILL THESE POSITIONS ON CENTRE BELL DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] I'M -- IN A LEED EVER COMMENT BEFORE I GO TO OKAY SO I'M GONNA GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE SOME ON THIS ITEM. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR NANCY TRAVEL WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. I PARTICULARLY WANT TO COMMENT ON THE VERY CRITICAL NEED FOR FINDING THE ADDITIONAL JUDGES. AS AN ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS LAWYERS WHO PRACTICE IN CIVIL CASES. OVER THE LAST DECADE. OUR LAWYERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THE MOST SEVERE DELAYS BECAUSE KHAN CONSTITUTIONALLY CRIMINAL CASES TAKE A PRECEDENT CIVIL CASES HAVE BEEN THIS POOR STEPCHILD IN TERMS OF GETTING ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN ACCESS TO COURT ROOMS. SO WE THINK THAT IT'S LONG PAST TIME TO FUND THE JUDGES THAT WERE AUTHORIZED WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN I IN OUR VIEW. THE TWENTY FIVE THAT WERE JUST REQUESTED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AT A MINIMUM SHOULD BE FUNDED THIS YEAR. AND THE REMAINING TWENTY THREE SHOULD BE FUNDED NAPSTER SO AT LEAST WE GET BACK UP. TO THE AMOUNT THAT WAS AUTHORIZED ALL THE WAY BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN OUR MEMBERS REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM ELDER ABUSE. WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM SEX DISCRIMINATION WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM SEX ABUSE WHO ARE CATASTROPHICALLY INJURED AND THEY NEED TO HAVE THEIR MOTIONS HEARD THEY NEED TO HAVE THOSE COURT ROOMS? AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SO WE THINK NOW IS THE TIME TO FINALLY FIND THOSE. JUDGESHIPS THANKS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND WAS GARY NADLER I AM THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF CINEMA COUNTY AND THE CHAIR OF THE PRESIDING JUDGES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. JUST A MINUTE I'VE BEEN TOLD TO BE BRIEF DIFFICULT FOR ME BUT I WILL TRY TO DO THAT. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS FUNDING. IT HAS BEEN A VERY VERY BIG TOPIC WITH THE TRIAL JUDGES AND THE PRESIDING JUDGES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ON THAT'LL SAY WITH THAT SUPPORT EXPRESSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL OUT ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DEFENSE COUNSEL WE ARE AN ASSOCIATION OF CIVIL PRACTITIONERS DEFENDING IN CIVIL LITIGATION. LIKE TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH MS TRAVELS COMMENTS ABOUT ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS AND SUPPLEMENT WHAT SHE SAID IN THIS WAY. YOU YOU RAISE SOME INTERESTING COMPARISONS WHAT ABOUT TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN NOW AND SO ON AND WHAT IS CHANGE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DID CHANGE BACK THEN IS -- FEES FOR CIVIL LITIGANTS WENT UP DRAMATICALLY. AND YOU YET WHAT WE'RE NOT. BEING HOWDY HERE BUT WHAT WAS AS WE WERE PAYING MORE WHILE CIVIL TRIALS WERE TAKING A BACKSEAT TO CONSTITUTIONAL SPEEDY TRIAL REQUIREMENTS ON CRIMINAL. SO WE WERE LITERALLY PAYING MORE AND GETTING LESS. AND THAT'S BEEN TRUE NOW FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEGIN TO WRITE THAT. JUST AS MS DRABBLE. MEMBERS RELY ON THE SPEEDY AND EFFICIENT. ADMINISTRATION OF CASES SO DOES THE DEFENSE. AND IN SOME COUNTIES IT CAN BE EIGHT AND TWELVE MONTHS TO GET A SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION CALENDAR AND HEARD FOR EXAMPLE SO THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY AND SO WE WOULD ASSOCIATE OURSELVES WITH THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS. AND ASK AT A MINIMUM FOR THAT TO HAPPEN THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS IGNITES YOUR HERNANDEZ ACTUALLY HER BEHALF TO CLIENTS AND TWO RELATED BUT ISSUES. ONE IS THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTER ASSOCIATION AND WHILE THERE IS A LOT TO SAY -- I'M HOPING THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE AND ASK SOME QUESTIONS IN ADDITION TO HAVING PUBLIC COME ASK QUESTIONS OF SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS HERE ONLINE WE HAVE A NUMBER OF OUR REPRESENTATIVES IN LINE THAT WILL TRY TO RESPOND. TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE MADE BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE CHAIR OF THE MEMBERS WOULD INDULGE IN ASK SOME OF THE MEN -- PUBLIC MEMBERS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS HOW -- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION -- AS THE AS THEY MAKE THEIR PUBLIC COMMENT FEEL FREE TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES -- I WILL NOT WHILE I OF COURSE APPRECIATE BREVITY L. NOT CUT YOU OFF IF YOU ARE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE RAISED. PREVIEW THAT I I WILL TAKE IT I WILL DENOUNCE TAKE IT'S PERSONALLY GIVE KIND OF A LITTLE BOOK BROUGHT ANSWER. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE ISSUES ON BEHALF OF CAL REPORTER ASSOCIATION -- AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS THE IDEA THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE QUOTE UNQUOTE SHORTAGE. REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN A NUMBER OF WAYS NUMBER ONE AND AND I THINK SANDIEGO WAS BROUGHT UP -- KEEP IN MIND HISTORICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO THE COURT REPORTERS AND CIVIL IN FAMILY LAW WERE FIRED AND LET GO. SO THERE YOU HAVE A POTENTIAL WORK FORCE THAT WAS ALREADY FEELING A LOT OF THE SLOTS IN FACT THAT RESULTED IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECISION. IT JUST CAME OUT A FEW MONTHS AGO -- INDICATING THAT LOW INCOME LITIGANTS ARE THAT THEIR RIGHTS ARE BEING VIOLATED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME RESOURCES CORP READ COREY PORTER. AS HE ASKED SOMEONE WHO IS MORE FLUENT SO WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES AND PULLING BACK THE LAYERS YOU START SEEING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT PICTURE OF WHAT THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE SHORTAGES AND I KNOW SOME OTHER FOLKS WILL ADDRESS -- APPLICATIONS IN SAN DIEGO AS FAR AS THE PIPELINE. FOR COURT REPORTERS IN THE ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE IS -- THERE IS A TRANSCRIPT FEE THAT IS SET BY STATUTE SO THE WAY THAT QUARTER REPORTERS. IN ALL COUNTIES ARE SET UP THEY ARE EMPLOYEES OR WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE WORK DAY. AT NIGHT BY STATUTEIN ON WEEKENDS WHEN THEY'RE WORKING ON TRANSCRIPTS INCLUDED TRANSCRIPTS THAT BY STATUTE THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DELIVER WITHIN A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD SPECIALLY FELONY PRELIMS. AND IF THEY'RE LATE THEY GET DOCKED 50%. THAT THEY ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR THAT TIME PERIOD FOR THE EVENINGS AND WEEKENDS WHICH THEY WORK REGULARLY. THEY DO NOT RECEIVE COMPENSATION. FROM THE COURTS. INSTEAD THEY RECEIVE THIS FEE. WHEN THE WHEN THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING INTO THE CORE PORTING PROFESSION ARE EXPLAINED AFTER WORK ON THEIR OWN BY THEIR OWN EQUIPMENT? PAY THE SELF EMPLOYMENT TAX AND THEN THERE EXPLAIN -- BY THE WAY THE FEE FOR THAT TRANSCRIPT WAS SET IN. NINETEEN NINETY BY THE LEGISLATURE AND HAS NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THEN. THAT BECOMES A PROBLEM RECRUITING INDIVIDUALS IT'S ONE OF MANY PROBLEMS THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED. LEGISLATION TO INCREASE. THAT FEE A FEW TIMES. I'VE BEEN VETOED A HAS NOT BEEN SUPPORTED BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL OFFICIALLY -- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE THINK COULD HELP IF WE WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE THESE ISSUES -- THE LASTING ALL ADDRESS BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF IS IS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE TEN MILLION. I'M I CAN TELL YOU AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE SPECIFICALLY WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE IN SPECIFIC COUNTIES. BUT AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MEETING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AND IF I HAVE THIS WRONG I CAN BE CORRECTED BY THE VIDEO IRONICALLY -- V. JUDICIAL COUNCIL MADE CLEAR THAT IF THERE IS A COUNTY. THAT ALREADY IS PROVIDING FAMILY LAW COURT REPORTERS OR IF THEY'RE FULL OR YOU KNOW THEY'RE FULLY PROVIDING THE SERVICES IN FAMILY LAW. THEN THEY COULD STILL GET ACCESS TO SOME MONEY AND USE THAT MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR WHEN THEY SAID. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WE SAID IT COULD ONLY BE FOR FOR FOR COURT REPORTERS THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CABBIE ON ASTERISK AND IT WAS A VERY BIG. DEBATE I'M AT THE TIME THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MADE ITS MOTION IN THERE ARE CHANGES TO THE MOTION. BUT THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF LEVERAGE AND BECAUSE OF THAT YOU WILL HEAR. IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. REPORTER TO BE MOVED FROM ONE DEPARTMENT NON FAMILY LAW DEPARTMENTS OVER TO FAMILY LOT APARTMENTS. IT FULLY PROVIDE. POTENTIALLY IN FAMILY LAW. THEY WER ABLE TO GET THAT MONEY DO OTHER THINGS WITH IT AND THEN THEY CREATE A PROBLEM. IN OTHER CASES NON FAMILY LAW CASES WHERE THERE WASN'T A COURT REPORTER AVAILABLE YOU CAN HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT LET ME JUST CLOSE ON BEHALFOF ANOTHER CLIENT BUT ON THIS ISSUE -- THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE WHICH IS STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION FROM DEFENSE LAWYERS. AND HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM THEY'VE AUTHORIZED ME TO SHARE WITH YOU. THAT THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN A THE USE OF ELECTRONIC RECORDING EQUIPMENT IN MISDEMEANOR CASES AND GROWING. AND THEY ARE EXTREMELY I'M PLEASED WITH IT SO FOR THE BAR THAT HANDLES THESE CASES THEY DO NOT THINK OF TRONIC RECORDING EQUIPMENT IS THE WAY TO GO. ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG WAY TO GO AND HAVE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS AND THEY HAVE TAKEN SITE -- IN THEIR CASES WITH ON GETTING ACCURATE LOT OF VOICES TALK OVER EACH OTHER IN AUDIBLE. SEVEN ZERO HERE THE JUDGES SO THEY'RE REALLY NOT HAPPY WITH SEEN IN SOME COURTROOMS WHERE THEY'RE INCREASING ELECTRONIC RECORDING THERE -- BECAUSE A MOVE CORE PART IS THE FAMILY LAW SO THAT THEY CAN USE THE MONEY FOR OTHER PURPOSES AS OPPOSED TO I THINK THE INTENT. OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS TO SUPPLEMENT THE COURT REPORTER WORK FORCE AND I THINK SOME COURTS OF TAKE COULD BE SUPPLEMENT. YOU KNOW JUST MAKE SURE FAMILIES TAKE CARE OF THEM THEY CAN DO OTHER THINGS WITH THE MONEY IN IN PART IS BECAUSE JUDICIAL COUNCIL GAVE THEM THAT OPENING. ALL MY COMMENTS BY MAY COME BACK UP. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S SANDEEP WALTON I AM THE PRESIDENT FOR S. CI YOU TEND TO WANNA CONTRA COSTA COUNTY. ALSO THE PRESIDENT ELECT FOR C. C. R. A.. A COUPLE THINGS -- ONE I WANT TO THANK THE FOR HAVING THE LEGISLATURE ALLOW THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE FAMILY OUR REPORTERS. MY COUNTY WAS ABLE TO HIRE. TO AND IN THE SAME BREATH THEY TURNED AROUND AND BOUGHT ENOUGH AUDIO RECORDING EQUIPMENT FOR EVERY SINGLE COURT ROOM IN. A PONY. AND TO ADDRESS THE QUOTE UNQUOTE SHORTAGE IT'S NOT A SHORTAGE AT CEMEX ALLOCATION OF REPORTERS. IN CONTRA COSTA WE ALSO FIRED LAID OFF FOR ATTRITION GOT RID OF REPORTERS IN CIVIL IN FAMILY LAW. AND WE'VE HIRED TO TO REPLACE ANYONE OF THE LAWN MOTION CALENDARS OVER THERE THERE'S TEN COURT REPORTERS LINED UP WITH MACHINES WAITING TO HEAR ONE MATTER. AND THOSE OTHER NINE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE COULD BE OUT COVERING OTHER COURTROOMS OTHER DEPOSITIONS SO IT'S A MESS ALLOCATION AND IT'S CREATING A PERCEIVED SHORTAGE WHERE THERE IS NOT. ONE THAT THE COURTS HAVE CREATED ON THEIR OWN BY GETTING RID OF FAMILY LAW AND CIVIL REPORTERS. SO IF YOU WOULD EMPLOY ONE PERSON IN THERE YOU'D HAVE THAT MANY MORE. TO COVER OTHER MATTERS IN THE FIELD THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME -- MADAM CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE HARD WORKING SUBCOMMITTEE STAFF MY NAME IS DIANA VAN **** I'M AN OFFICIAL WITH LA SUPERIOR COURT. I'M ALSO THE CURRENT PRESIDENT FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION MEMBER OF C. C. R. A. AND I'M A MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL. SEVEN TO ONE I WOULD LIKE TO GO OUR SCRIPTS AND ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE TWO OF BIG COMMENTS ARE REALLY CAUGHT MY EAR AT THIS MORNING. FIRST -- MADAM CHAIR -- I WAS INVOLVED IN THE FORMING OF BOTH THE TEST AND HIRING PROCESS FOR THE REPORTERS ONCE LA SUPERIOR COURT WAS ABLE TO START RETIRING REPORTERS. THERE WAS A MACHINE TEST INVOLVED IN THAT SITUATION AND REPORTERS TRICKLED IN THIS WAS ON TOP OF ALREADY PASSING ONE OF THE HARDEST DETESTS TO BE A CERTIFIED STENOGRAPHER FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THIS WAS ON TOP OF THAT. ONCE MANAGEMENT SAW AN ADMINISTRATION SAW THAT THE TRICKLE THEY CAME BACK WE SAT DOWN RE RECONFIGURED THEY TOOK AWAY THAT MACHINE PORTION. AND WE SELL A DELUGE TO THE ONCE IN A ROW WE WERE INTERVIEWING. FIVE SIX POTENTIAL REPORTERS AND HAVING TO HAVE A DESIGNATED HUMAN RESOURCES PERSON TO BRING THOSE PEOPLE AND GET THEM FINGERPRINTED AND GET THE MAN. SO THERE WAS A A HELP IN THAT REGARD -- HAS A TRICKLE DOWN YES BECAUSE I WOULD. BE BACK ON MIGHT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WHEN YOU HAVE A FREELANCE WORLD THAT IS COLLIDING WITH THE OFFICIAL SHIPS AND PUBLI SERVICE. YOU'RE NOT JUST -- COMBINED IN COSTS IN WHAT WE MAKE YOUR AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENS LIKE SANDY SAID PREVIOUSLY. EIGHT SEVEN OR EIGHT OF THOSE REPORTERS COULD IF THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE WORK POTENTIALLY COME IN AND WANT TO PROVIDE SERVICES AS A PUBLIC SERVANT AS OFFICIALS IN THE COURTS SO. I WOULD SPEAK TO A CHANGE AND THAT AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE -- OF EACH INDIVIDUAL COURT WHAT THEY'RE REQUESTING UP I WILL REPEAT THE CALIFORNIA C. S. R. TEST. AND I'VE BEEN A REPORTER. FOR TWENTY THREE YEARS NOW IS ONE OF THE HARDEST CERTIFY TESTS. I'M PROUD OF IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE CERTIFICATION BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET THESE REPORTERS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES IN THE DOOR AND GET THEM INTERESTED. I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU -- MR MALEK TEAR YOUR QUEST AN UNUSUAL I'M REPORTERS HAVE BEEN RETIRED FOR MANY YEARS WHEN THEY WERE BABY REPORTERS THEY WERE BEING ASKED WHY NOT TAPE IT. NOW IT'S WHY NOT AUDIO RECORDED WHY NOT VIDEOTAPE IT IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. WHAT WE DON'T LOOK AT AND WHAT LAY PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY ASKED THAT QUESTION IS THE FEES THAT AND THE TIME THAT ARE WASTED AT THE BACK END? I TAKE THE RISK I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RECORD I GUARD ON THE GUARDIAN OF THE RECORD. I'M ALSO THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE INSERTED FOR CERTIFYING THAT RECORD IT'S MY LICENSE ON THE LINE. SO I AM ONE PERSON IN THE ROOM GUARDING IT FROM CROSS TALKING GUARDING IT FROM. EMOTIONAL PARTICULARLY IN FAMILY LAW CASES WHERE I THINK WE CAN ALL IMAGINE IT'S SOME OF THE MOST EMOTIONAL -- HEARINGS. AND PROTECTING IT AND MAKING SURE EVERY SINGLE WORD EVERY SINGLE SPEAKER WAS PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AND I SIGN MY NAME TO THAT WHEN YOU START IMPLEMENTING VIDEO AND AUDIO. THOSE PEOPLE MAY NOT BE IN THE ROOM NUMBER ONE AND NOW YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SEPARATING TO MAYBE TWO OR THREE OTHER SUBCONTRACTORS THAT ARE COMPLETELY SEPARATE AND NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CERTIFYING THAT RECORD FOR THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE OF ME IN THIS REGARD. I DON'T CARE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME'S SCOTT. MCCOURT GATOR IN CONTRA COSTA. BARTON LOCATIONS FIELD.

LAST YEAR IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE HAD AN ELDERLY ADULTS. IN A CARE HOME DRIVE NEGLECT WALLACE FULLY STAFFED INVESTIGATIONS UNIT MAY NOT.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRPERSON SKINNER IN AND SENATORS I APPRECIATE THE TIME YOU'VE GIVEN ME MY NAME IS LESLIE MAYBE I'M PRESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS I'VE BEEN A COURTROOM CLERK IN ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS -- I CAN SAY THAT MOST OF US ERE IN THE ROOM HAVE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE IMPACTS OF THE THE REDUCTIONS THAT OCCURRED THAT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT IN ORANGE COUNTY SPECIFICALLY WE LOST A COURTHOUSE THAT SERVED SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND RESIDENTS. THOSE RESIDENTS NOW HAVE TO TRAVEL FURTHER ACCESS TO FOR THEIR JUSTICE OF THEIR CASES AS WELL AS LATE AWAIT FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME -- BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL EXPERIENCING -- WE APPRECIATE THE RECENT INVESTMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE IN THE COURTS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO BUILD. UPON THE COURT'S BETTER BUT WE'RE ASKING. AT THIS TIME. WE NEED MORE. WE NEED MORE I MEAN THE LAW FRONTLINE WORKERS THAT'S WHO'S PROVIDING THAT ACCESS TO THAT JUSTICE ARE KEEP WE'RE PROVIDING THAT. OUR COMMUNITIES TO WORK OUR FAMILIES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS AND WITHOUT THAT MANY WE CAN'T GET STAFFING BACK UP WE CAN'T GET BACKLOG BACK UP AND WE CAN'T GET TO ALL THE CASE RESOLUTION. THAT WE NEED TO DO NESTLE FRONTLINE WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN TOWING THE LINE AND DOING MORE WITH LESS SO WE ASK YOU PLEASE AT WE JUST NEED MORE FUNDING I CAN'T EVEN PUT A NUMBER ON IT. WE JUST NEED THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THAT IF NOTHING MORE JUST TO SERVICE OUR COMMUNITIES. AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE LATER WE'RE ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BROOKE RYAN ON OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER WITH THE SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT I'VE BEEN A REPORTER FOR TWENTY TWO YEARS. I AM A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION I'M INVOLVED WITH THEIR LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE. I AM A CURRENT MEMBER OF THE NASH AND THE CURRENT BOARD MEMBER FOR THE NATIONAL COURT REPORTERS ASSOCIATION. AND I AM HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU AS THE CHAIR OF UNITED PUBLIC EMPLOYEES -- LOCAL UNION SO THERE'S A NUMBER REST IF I MAY I'M I'M GONNA START WITH THE C. C. R. A. COMPONENT WHAT I DO FOR C. SERIES I FACT GATHER. THAT IS MY JOB AND SO -- I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS SAN DIEGO FIRST WE HAVE A CURRENT BOARD MEMBER THAT IS EMPLOYED WITH -- SAN DIEGO LAST YEAR WHEN SHE APPLIED SHE WAS RANKED NUMBER TWENTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY SEVEN THEY HAD FIFTY SEVEN QUALIFIED COURT REPORTERS THAT APPLY. I AM SO THEN I TOOK I TOOK THE TIME TO CALL IN NUMBER THE PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T TAKE THE JOB AND WHAT THEY HAD ASKED FOR WAS THE TOP STEP. BECAUSE THEY'RE MAKING SO MUCH MORE MONEY IN THE FREE MARKET RIGHT SO MR RODDY SAID THEY HAD SO MANY PEOPLE RETIRING I'M GONNA ASSUME FOR THE SAKE OF THIS THAT THEY RETIRED AT THE TOP STEP. YOU CAN BRING THEM IN AT THE TOP STEP AND REPLACE THEM BUT THE COURT REFUSED SO NUMBER OF THOSE COURT REPORTERS WERE NOT HIRED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD. I'M TWERKED THERE BUT WE DO KNOW -- SOME HAVE BEEN -- HIRED THE OTHER THING IS THE FACT GATHER IS LIKE DIANE AND SANDY BOTH ALLUDED. TO WE HAVE PICTURES OF UP AND DOWN THIS COURTHOUSE WHEN THE COURTS GOT RID OF CIVIL COURT REPORTERS IN FAMILY LAW OF NUMEROUS COURT REPORTERS IN THEIR MACHINES LINED UP AGAINST THE BENCH. AND THEY RUN UP AND GRAB THEIR MACHINE TO COVER THE ONE MATTER AND THEN THEY RUN OUT. THERE'S THERE THEY ARE RIGHT THERE WE HAVE COURT REPORTERS WE KNOW THEY'RE APPLYING FOR POSITIONS I UNDERSTAND FROM DIANA THAT -- A LATE HAS BEEN A BACKLOG IN PROCESSING OVER HUNDRED APPLICANTS A SACRAMENTO -- WALL. THEY USED TO ALWAYS GIVE US THE NUMBERS NOW THERE'S LIKE. I'M SO NOW I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT -- SACRAMENTO IF I MAY SO AT SACRAMENTO GOT MONEY FOR FAMILY LAW COURT REPORTERS AND THEY'VE HIRED. TWO FOR FAMILY LAW HOWEVER IN THE MEANTIME THEY HAVE FROZE NINE OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER POSITIONS THIS JUST HAPPENED THEY JUST INSTALLED E. R.. IN -- THREE THE DEPARTMENTS SAY THEY TOOK YOUR MONEY AND THEY BOUGHT. YOUR MACHINE AND THEN FROZE ALL THE REST OF OR POSITIONS. SO -- WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT THE JUDICIAL POSITIONS IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM ONE TO SIX JUDGES A DAY ARE GOING DARK BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT HIRING STAFF. ONE TO SIX A MARCH NO ON FEBRUARY ELEVENTH IT WAS THE MONDAY BEFORE THE HOLIDAY THAT'S THE RIGHT DATE THEY HAD TO DISMISS OUT WRITER TO DEFENDANT FELONY TRIAL. IS DISMISSED. BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY DON'T HAVE A COURT NO THEY HAD A COURT YEAH JUDGES SITTING IN THEIR CHAMBERS. NOT WORKING ON THE RECORD BECAUSE A REFUSING TO HIRE STAFF. SO DO WE NEED JUDICIAL POSITIONS. NOT JUST ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT ON FOR THEM TO WORK THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO HIRE STAFF STAFF WE KNOW THIS OUT THERE. THEY JUST NEED TO HIRE IF THEY'D FOR FAMILY LOT THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO COME IN AND TAKE THOSE JOBS BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN -- YOU KNOW A EMPLOYED BY LAW FIRMS TO COME IN AND TAKE THOSE CASES AND SO WHAT I DO NOW IS MY FRIENDS OUT THERE THERE ON THE CIVIL SIDE. THEY GET A HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A DAY APPEARANCE BE. WELL AS AN OFFICIAL IF YOU COME IN IT THERE'S A USER FEE IN OUR USER FREEDOM SECOND I WAS LIKE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS WHAT'S LOST IN THIS CONVERSATION TO ME. IS ACTUAL. WHAT'S GOING ON TO THE CONSUMER SO THE CONSUMERS PAIN FIT UPWARDS OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND MORE A DAY TO GET A COURT REPORTER IN THERE. INSTEAD OF THE USER FEE THAT THING COMES BACK TO THE COURTS TO PAY FOR US. AT I LOOK FOR THE ANY QUESTIONS TO AND THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NUMBERS. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BEATRICE NO NOT MY FAMILY COURT COUNSELOR WITH CONTRA COSTA SUPERIOR COURT. AND I'M HERE TO TALK. ABOUT -- THE ISSUE OF A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT -- HELPS TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES IS -- TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC -- EFFECTIVELY WHEN WE ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCES TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT RETENTION AND LOOKING AT THE COURT REPORTERS. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE THAT -- IS AFFECTING QUICKLY PUT. THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL COURT. SO I'M HERE TO ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER -- ALLOCATING FUNDS FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR COURT EMPLOYEES THANK YOU. HI LESLIE HI MY CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT ALL THE CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO AND PLASTER COUNTIES. AND JUST ONE OFFER OUR SUPPORT BOTH THROUGH THE JUDICIAL ITEM -- WE ARE MANY OF OUR JUDGES AND THE COUNTIES THAT WE PRACTICE AND STRUGGLE WITH CRUSHING CASELOADS AND WITHOUT THOSE POSITIONS FILLED WE CAN'T MOVE. ANY OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE MADE DON'T HAVE ANY EFFECT WE CAN STAFF MORE ATTORNEYS IN THE COURTROOM BUT IF THERE'S NO JUDGE OR THE JUDGE IS STILL TRYING TO GET THROUGH A VERY HEAVY CALENDAR IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE WHOLE PROBLEM AND I THINK. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE COURT REPORTER P. SIMILARLY. WE CAN'T BREAK UP THE COURT SYSTEM INTO PIECES OF LAWYERS OR JUDGES OR COURT REPORTERS OR DAFT BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO MOVE OUR CALENDARS ALONG. THE IMPACT ON THAT FOR THE I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THE COURT REPORTER ISSUES ARE THAT THE DIFFERENCES OF PERSPECTIVE. FOR SURE BUT I CAN SAY THAT ON A DAY I WOULD SAY ONCE A WEEK WE HAVE AT LEAST ONE OR TWO DEPENDENCY COURT ROOMS IN LA COUNTY THEY CANNOT DO CASES UNTIL AT LEAST AFTER LUNCH TIME BECAUSE THERE'S NO COURT REPORTER. I'M AND WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO BECOME A WORK AND IT KEEPS KIDS FROM HAVING THEIR HEARINGS AND KEEPS FAMILIES FROM GETTING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. THANK YOU. IT'S STILL MORNING GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR -- MOM MY NAME IS TERRENCE TRACY. AND I'M WITH ASKED ME TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED IN COALITION WITH AS HE ARE YOU TEN TO ONE WE ARE REQUESTING. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR COST OF LIVING RAISES. THERE ARE A COUPLE ISSUES THAT WERE BROUGHT UP THAT I'D LIKE TO ANSWER -- VERY QUICKLY I AM THE SENIOR LEAGUE CLERK AND JUVENILE DIVISION AND CUT ACROSS THE COUNTY AND I AM WELL AWARE OF THE REPORTING ISSUE -- ER IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME BECAUSE OF ITS INCONSISTENCY. AND WHEN A JUDGE REQUIRES A READ BACK. THERE. ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITY PUT ON COURTROOM CLERKS TO NOW DO THAT JOB SO THEY'RE DOING AN ADDITIONAL JOB. ALSO -- YOU HAD MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT THE INCREASED WORKLOADS PROP FIFTY SEVEN IN PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ADDED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORKLOAD WITH -- DURING A CRISIS BUDGET CRISIS WHEN WE WERE LOSING I'M PARTICULARLY -- EMPLOYEES TO FILL THOSE APPS I'M. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. OF THE COST OF LIVING IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA AND I KNOW THAT -- THE CHAIRPERSON IS AWARE OF THIS IS GONE UP OVER 25%. AND WE WORDS AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU GAVE US LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO GET A OVER A COURSE OF TWO YEARS A 4% RATES. SO WE'RE STILL BEHIND THE BALL BY 21%. AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ADDITIONAL FUNDING DISCRETIONARY FUNDING IF YOU KNOW IF NOTHING ELSE I'M TO THE COURTS THANK YOU. HI MAN CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME MY NAME IS APRIL HOWEVER ON I'M A COURT REPORTER. IN CONTRA COSTA SUPERIOR COURT IN MARTINEZ I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF LABOR UNION SEIU LOCAL. TEN TO ONE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE BUDGET ON WITH MEDITATION FOR GORE REPORTER'S TRANSCRIPT FEES CORE PORTERS HAVE NOT RECEIVE AN INCREASE. IN THEIR STATUTORILY SET TRANSCRIPT RATE IN THIRTY YEARS. WE URGE WE URGE YOU TO INCREASE THE TRANSCRIPT FEE PHASES OVER TIME WITH AN APPROXIMATE. ONE POINT FIVE TO TWO MILLION DOLLAR COST IN YOUR ONE AND AN APPROXIMATE SIX TO SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR COST IN THE FINAL YEAR. DOES PROVIDE AN COURT PROCEEDINGS. THIS IS A FEMALE DOMINATED PROFESSION ESPECIALLY DURING WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH WE MUST REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE MUST CLOSE THE PAY GAP ITHAS BEEN THIRTY YEARS SINCE WE RECEIVED AN INCREASE IN THE TRANSCRIPT RIGHT. NOW IS THE TIME TO KNOWLEDGE ARE WORTH AND APPROVE THE TRANSCRIPT. AGE RATE INCEASE AND I'M SURE I JUST LIKE TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION. OF OF WHY. I BELIEVE IT WAS SOMETHING LONG LINES OF WHY AREN'T THE STUDENTS. PASSING THE TEST AS THEY WERE BEFORE. OR FOR THAT MATTER WHY AREN'T MORE PEOPLE APPLYING TO BE TO BE A COURT ORDER. YOUR QUESTION WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE THE RUMOR THAT WHY ARE WE REPLACED WHY ARE WHY ARE ISN'T WHAT WE DO. SO VALUABLE THAT WE NEED TO BE REPLACED BY ELECTRONIC RECORDING. WHEN I START WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THAT'S THE FIRST QUESTION I ASKED BEFORE I WENT TO SCHOOL FOR SOMETHING OR WE'RE GOING BE REPLACED? SO. THIRTY YEARS LATER. I'M GAINFULLY EMPLOYED. I CAN DO WHAT NO MACHINE CAN DO. AND AS FAR AS GETTING AN ACCURATE RECORD WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTED FIGURE IN COURT. AND YOU'RE HAVING THINGS TAKEN DOWN -- I CAN STOP PEOPLE. PAPERS ARE CRUMBLING AND I CAN'T HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WHAT PEOPLE CALL OFF WHEN THE DOOR SLAM WHEN I DON'T KNOW WHICH WORD THEY ARE DID YOU SAY ISSUES ARE HIS SHOES. NOT NORMALLY ON THOUGH THERE TALK TALKING ABOUT SHOES OR ISSUES. BUT ONLY A PERSON CAN MAKE THAT. IN MY OPINION I PLAN ON LOOKING INTO THIS BECAUSE THIS AFFECTS MY CAREER. THE SCHOOLS THE CORPORATE SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW CHANGE THEIR THEORY. THEIR THEORY THAT'S OUR STOMACH. AND THE NUMBERS WENT DOWN WE HAD A 19%. NOW 5%. SO I PLAN ON LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS AND THEN WHEN THEY CHANGE THE THEORY ON WHY WERE NOT PASSING. BUT WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO GET INTO A PROFESSION THAT EVERYONE SAYS WE CAN BE REPLACED. WE CAN'T BE REPLACED. AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE ATTORNEYS THE JUDGES THEY DON'T LIKE THE ARE THEY DON'T HAVE A SAY ABOUT IT I DON'T LIKE YOUR THEY WANT A PERSON THEY WON A COURT ORDER. THEY WANT THE BEST MOST ACCURATE TRANSCRIPT THEY CAN HAVE WHICH IS WHAT EVERYONE WANTS. SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH FREE TIME. MORNING GOOD MORNING I'M SURE MANY MEMBERS MACHON CAST OF THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. SEIU REPRESENTS TRIAL COURT EMPLOYEES AND THIRTY NINE COUNTY SO I I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO SUM UP WHAT OUR OVERALL POSITION AS AND THEN ANSWER. THE DRESS A COUPLE ISSUES THAT CAME UP. FIRST -- WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO FOR THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS WERE PROVIDED LAST YEAR AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL FORTY SEVEN MILLION THAT WENT TO THE MOST UNDER FUNDED TRIAL COURTS. WHAT THAT DID WAS ALLOW ALL COURTS TO BENEFIT A MODEST AMOUNT FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION? AND THEN GIVE THAT EXTRA AMOUNT TO THE YES TO THAT -- THE EFFORT WAS TO EQUALIZE FUNDING AMONG THE TRIAL COURTS WITH A FINITE POT OF MONEY SO YOU HAD. DONORS AND RECIPIENTS SO LAST YEAR WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT KIND OF ROB PETER TO PAY PAUL SCENARIO WAS WAS RECTIFIED -- WE HOPE TO SEE SOME FUNDING -- AGAIN THIS YEAR ALLOCATE IN A SIMILAR MANNER -- FOR THOSE MOST UNDERFUNDED COURTS EQUALIZER FUNDING BUT ALSO TO ALLOW OTHER TRIAL COURTS THAT WERE ALSO UNDER FUNDED TO CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. TOWARDS THINGS THAT WERE DELINEATED EARLIER RESEARCH RE HIRING STAFF -- LENGTHENING HOURS OF OPERATIONS THOSE SORT OF THINGS WE HAVE SOME MODEST MOMENTUM WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CONTINUE TO GO FORWARD. ONE THING THAT'S REALLY MISSING IN THE TRIAL COURT BUDGET THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER BUDGETS IS THAT THE TRIAL COURT BUDGET DOES NOT HAVE A COLA MECHANISM. FOR COST OF DOING BUSINESS ADJUSTMENT TO IT. SO THEIR BUDGET IS HELD FLAT EACH YEAR UNLESS YOU ALLOCATE ANY MONEY SO THERE'S NO LIKE I SAID NO COLA. SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY PROGRAMS EVERY OTHER PROGRAM HAS AT TRIAL COURTS A TRUST FUND DID HAVE THAT FUND -- AND IT WAS A STRAIGHT APPROPRIATION LIMIT -- ADJUSTMENT TO IT IT PREVIOUSLY IT'S TIME TO REINSTATE THAT MONEY. I'M SO THE COURTS CAN PREDICT FROM YEAR TO YEAR WHAT MODEST GROWTH THEY MAY HAVE IT ALSO GIVES THEM AN ABILITY TO COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES WHICH IS ALSO DIFFICULT FOR COURTS WHEN THEY'RE OPERATING AND FIND A POT OF MONEY -- WITH REGARD TO COURT REPORTERS SINCE LAST YEAR'S MODEST ALLOCATION OUR OUR LEGISLATIVE INTENT TO SPEND TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE FAMILY LAW COURT I'M TWO CASES WERE -- WERE DECIDED SOMEONE MENTIONED JAMISON -- THE DESTA WHICH ADDRESS INDIGENT LITIGANTS. BEING ENTITLED TO THE SAME RESOURCES AS ANOTHER INTO. INDIVIDUAL THE OTHER CASE WAS DO CAN BE COMANCHE HILLS THAT STATED THAT THE REPORTER SHALL BE REQUIRED -- PROVIDED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS -- SO WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THE DEMAND IN THE REQUIREMENTS IS THERE IS EVEN GREATER NOW THAN IT WAS LAST YEAR AND THE COURT HAS. COURTS HAVE SPOKEN TO THAT MATTER -- AS MENTIONED THE COURT REPORTER TRANSCRIPT RATE IS THIRTY YEARS OUTSTANDING AND WE WOULD ALSO ASK FOR A MODEST INCREASE WITH THAT -- THE RESERVES ARE VERY RESTRICTIVE AND IT'S HARD FOR TRIAL COURTS OPERATE WITH THAT 1% RESERVE CAP SO WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME ADJUSTMENT TO THAT -- WE ARE SUPPORTED OF FUNDING FOR DEPENDENTS TO COUNSEL WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- THE JUDGESHIPS IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE JUDGE THAT SHIP AMOUNTS COMES WITH. FUNDING FOR STAFF BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ALLOCATED IN THAT WAY WE THINK IT MUST BE USED IN THAT WAY. I'M ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE ALL THIS DEMAND FOR COURT REPORTERS -- THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SAN DIEGO SO I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THREE LICENSED COURT REPORTERS OVER SIX THOUSAND LICENSE REPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE TO FOURTEEN HUNDRED JUDGES STATEWIDE. THERE'S A LOT OF COURT REPORTERS OUT THERE THERE ARE THOSE JOBS I WOULD SAY PART OF THE PROBLEM IS NOT NECESSARILY A SHORTAGE PROBLEM BUT A RECRUITMENT PROBLEM. FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THE STARTING WAGE IS EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS PREVIOUSLY NOT SERVED. AS AN OFFICIAL COURT REPORTER SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE COURT BUT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN A FREELANCE COURT REPORTER FOR TWENTY YEARS. THE SAME STARTING WAGE FOR THAT SAME INDIVIDUAL IN RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO -- RIVERSIDE IN ORANGE COUNTY IS APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND THAT'S MORE DESIRABLE TO LIVE AND WORK IN RIVERSIDE. CHEAPER COSTS OF CHEAPER COST OF LIVING HIGHER WAGE. THE OTHER THING IN SAN DIEGO AS SOMEONE MENTIONED IS ALL THE FAMILY LAW CIVIL REPORTERS WERE LET GO. SO WHEN YOU COMBINE THAT WITH A LOWER WAGE A HISTORY OF TERMINATING STAFF DOESN'T BECOME THE MOST DESIRABLE PLACE. ADDITIONALLY THE REPORT RECORD REPORTERS REPORT TO ME. THAT THE CORE IS ONLY PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS IN MANY OF THESE PROCEEDINGS UPON REQUEST DESPITE THE COURT SAYING THE REPORTER MUST BE PROVIDED. THE REPORTERS ALSO REPORT THAT THEY ARE SITTING THERE WAITING TO BE ASSIGNED TO COURT ROOMS. AND WE'LL HAVE EIGHT TO TEN OF THEM SITTING THERE BUT THEY'RE NOT BEING ASSIGNED AN INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING A RECORD -- SO AGAIN I WOULD SAY IT'S A A RECRUITMENT PROBLEMS SOME PLACES I ALSO WANT TO SAY IN DEFENSE OF SAN DIEGO AND OTHER COURTS LIKE DIFFICULTY RECRUITING. IS IT THOSE COURTS WERE DONOR COURTS UNDER THE THE MODEL SO THEY WERE NOT. ENJOYING THE SAME AMOUNTS OF INCREASES OTHER COURTS SO THEY MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN HALF IN BRINGING UP THOSE WAGES TO BE COMPETITIVE TO RECRUIT PEOPLE. SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE PART THAT COULD BE PART OF THE PROBLEM -- MISTER MOORE LIKE ELECTRONIC RECORDING AND VIDEO REPORTING IS NOT A VERBATIM RECORD IN CALIFORNIA ARE STANDARD FOR TRANSCRIPTS IS A VERBATIM RECORD FOR NUMBER OF REASONS AND AUDIBLES -- VOICES GET LOST SOME MACHINES CAN'T -- PICK UP FEMALE VOICES WHICH PRIVILEGED CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN A LAWYER AND A CLIENT -- AND IT'S EXPENSIVE TO TRANSCRIBE -- ACCORDING TO A TRANSCRIPT. MR RODDY MENTIONED THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE DID IT DO A PILOT OF ELECTRONIC RECORDING. AND WHAT THAT YIELDED WAS A STATUTE THAT IS IN PLACE NOW THAT THE RECORDINGS WERE SO INCONSISTENT THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE MOST -- IMPORTANT TYPES OF PROCEEDINGS ADDITIONALLY I'VE FOUND THAT ONE PERSON THE COURT REPORTER WAS THEN REPLACED BY FOUR PEOPLE. BECAUSE WHAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS REMEMBER IS THAT THE COURT REPORTER HANDLES ADMINISTRATION. OF ALL THE TRANSCRIPTS THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THE CLIENTS AND THE AND OTHER WERE ON THE COURT ABOUT. GIVING TRANSCRIPTS OUT MAINTAINING TRANSCRIPTS SO YOU ALSO THEN SO THE COURT REPORTER WENT AWAY BUT YOU HAD SOMEONE MONITORING EQUIPMENT THE HOW TO E. R. MONITOR. YOUR SUPERVISOR GOT TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL CLERKS TO MANAGE THE TRANSCRIPTS -- COLLECTING FEES FROM INDIVIDUALS AND TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE THAT'S ALL DONE BY THE COURT REPORTER OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC'S COST. SO WE THINK THAT THE COURT REPORTER IS HIGHLY EFFICIENT FOR THE PUBLIC YOU'RE CERTAINLY THE GOLD STANDARD -- AND ENSURES THAT EVERY INDIGENT. INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY GETS A TRANSCRIPT WITH REGARD TO INDIGENT LEADING. THEY DON'T GET A TRANSCRIPT THEY GET A DESK WITH THE RECORDING OF THE PROCEEDINGS FROM THE ENTIRE DAY AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GO OUT INTO THE FREE MARKET AND FIND SOMEBODY TO TRANSCRIBE THAT FOR THEM. THAT'S A VERY VERY EXPENSIVE I PROBABLY COULD. SO WE THINK THE COURT REPORTER IS A GOLD STANDARD BECAUSE IT'S BEEN PROVEN. WE'VE SEEN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH ELECTRONIC RECORDING NVIDIA REPORTING AND THEY DON'T WORK. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS ALL GETS DOWN TO FUNDING I'M SURE OF MISTER RODDY HAD MORE MONEY HE COULD PROBABLY HIGHER HAVE A MORE COMPETITIVE WAGE. ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE AND I'M SURE THAT'S WHAT OF COURSE WOULD WANT BUT IT'S REALLY HARD BECAUSE NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO ADEQUATELY FUND THE SYSTEM OR EVEN GIVE THEM THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR BUDGETS WITH THE COLA. SO WITH THAT -- AND THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF MANY BY NELSON ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUES -- AND OUR MEMBERS I HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB -- KIND OF DESCRIBING WHAT THE CHALLENGES ARE -- AMONGST THE WORK FORCE A LIME WORKERS WHO -- A MINISTER ENSURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IN THE STATE -- YOU'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF ISSUES -- AND I'LL BE INCREDIBLY PER BEST ON BEST DISCRETIONARY FUNDS IN OUR STATE WE AND IN OUR TRIAL COURT SYSTEM WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD -- THE GAPS IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE AS A RESULT OF THE CUTS THAT WE EVEN TOURED -- OVER THE PAST DECADE A LONGER US IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE CONTINUING -- TO PUT RESOURCES INTO THE WORK FORCE -- I WOULD ALSO -- ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE POINTS THAT ARE MADE UP THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT COURT REPORTERS -- IN PARTICULARLY A REFORM IN REFORMING THE THE POINT I WAS JUST MADE BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT THIS IS THE GOLD STANDARD -- AND IN THIS STATE AND WE'VE TAKEN ON SO MANY. COMPLEX CHALLENGES ARE I DON'T THINK THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO RUSH TO OUTSOURCED WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE -- BY DEDICATED -- MEMBERS OF OUR COURT COURT WORK FORCE I THINK THIS PRECISELY THE TIME TO ENGAGE OUR THE LEGISLATURE PUT MONEY IN LAST YEAR SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSES WE DISCUSSED. OF TRYING TO ENSURE THAT -- YOU KNOW WE DO -- OTHERS FEEL VALUE FOLKS TWO I WANT TO PURSUE THE PROFESSION SO I THINK THIS IS PRECISELY TOM ADDRESS. THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE PREVENTING. US FROM -- ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE COURT REPORTER WORK FORCE THAT WE NEED -- IN I WOULD ALSO AGREE THAT THIS IS NOT A A CONVERSATION ABOUT A SHORTAGE -- WE NEED TO JUST THINK CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT THE WORK FORCE -- I WOULD ALSO OUT OF THE SUPPORT POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT TARGETING A RE INVESTMENTS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THIS COMMITTEE WHAT WE'VE BEEN. A REINVESTING IN SPECIFIC PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW ENSURE ACCESS TO JUSTICE WE KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT. KIND OF LINE ITEM CONTROL FROM THE LEGISLATURE -- OVER A SPECIFIC -- PROGRAMS OR SPECIFIC POSITIONS THAT NEED -- INVESTMENT IN OUR COURT -- SO I WOULD. ASK THIS COMMITTEE AS WE WILL BE THE REQUEST WAS MADE ABOUT COURT INVESTIGATORS THINK THEY PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE -- AND DO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT OUR POSITIONS LIKE THIS IN OUR COURT TO HAVE BEEN GETTING OVERLOOKED -- IN -- GUESS PAPER OF THE THE GLOBAL CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN PRESENTED ON THE COURSE IN FUNDING. HI ELEMENT AND IN THE FINAL POINT I'D RACES JUST TO SUPPORT THE ARGUMENT ABOUT -- WANTING TO INCREASE COST OF LIVING ARE WANTING TO ENSURE THAT THIS FUNDING FOR COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS -- WE'VE HEARD -- MANY TIMES A NOT JUST THIS YEAR -- BUT ALMOST EVERY YEAR ABOUT -- THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF NOT ONLY THE COURSE BUT ALSO THE WORKERS AND THE COURT SO I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS A STATE IF WE'RE GOING TO INVEST. IN THE NARRATIVE AROUND ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT WE TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE -- CONTINUE TO IS THIS COMMITTEE HAS -- IN AND SHARE OUR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE I'VE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB I THINK OF ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS. ABOUT -- ONE INSURE THAT WE'RE ALL SOLUTIONS THAT IMPROVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE THIS ITEM. AND WE'LL GO TO ITEM THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING IN SHARE AND WE APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO TRAVELED FAR. A MISTER RODDY. I'M REALLY APPRECIATE SO WE'RE GONNA GO TO ITEM THREE WITCHES% ARE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE B. C. P.. AND FOR THAT WE HAVE -- AGAIN ARE -- CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER BUDGET SERVICES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT ALSO -- MY COURTNEY WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES SERVICES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU MIKE FOR COMING -- THE BUDGET PROPOSAL ONE TIME GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION OF FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE MOST VITAL DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS IN THE TRIAL COURTS -- THESE FUNDS WILL SUPPORT FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT WE THINK THE AGENDAS BACKGROUND IN TERMS OF FUNDING STRUCTURE AD IS A IS A GOOD REFLECTION OF THE THE PROGRAM. AND WE'RE HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THAT YOU MAY HAVE AS A AS RELATES TO THE PROPOSAL. THIS. IS A MIKE HORTON. YES IT IS UNDER DID YOU. I COURTNEY I'M FORTY AND MY COURT. DID YOU WANNA MAKE A PRESENTATION SIR SURE OF COURSE WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR ANY FUNDING REAL RELATED TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OUR CURRENT BACKLOG OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ACROSS THE STATE IS NEARLY TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS -- THERE'S A COUPLE REASONS FOR THAT FIRST WE HAVE A VERY. OF FAST PORTFOLIO ACROSS THE STATE -- OUR OLDEST COURTHOUSE PULLS BACK TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY FOUR IN MARIPOSA COUNTY. WOOD FRAME BUILDINGS STILL HAS A WOOD FRAME STOVE IN IT STAY LANDMARK IT IS IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BUILDING ACTUALLY -- IN THERE. OUR NEWEST COURTHOUSE -- SAN DIEGO COUNTY -- FROM LAST YEAR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. YOU FOR BUILDING VERY MODERN -- THE AVERAGE AGE FOR PORTFOLIO IS ABOUT FIFTY YEARS. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE. THE CONDUCT THE VARYING CONDITIONS IN THE BILL PERSPECTIVE. SECONDLY -- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF NOT HAVING A FULLY FUNDED. PROGRAM -- WE SEE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. CURRENTLY FROM OF THE COURT SOLELY TRUST ONE FOR MAINTENANCE. THAT FUNDING HAS BEEN HAS HELD AT THAT LEVEL SINCE. TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN A WHILE OUR COSTS UTILITIES ALONE OF INCREASED MORE THAN 12%. WE'VE ALSO ADDED MORE THAN TWO POINT NINE MILLION SQUARE FEET -- IN THE PORTFOLIO FORM FROM NEW COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION AND WITH NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR MAINTENANCE. SO IF YOU IF YOU CAN'T MAINTAIN YOUR BUILDINGS PROPERLY THEN YOU OR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WILL INCREASE YOU YOU HAVE TO STOP. MAINTAINING SOMETHING TO LIVE WITHIN THE BUDGET FUNDS THAT YOU THAT YOU HAVE. WE NOW FOR THE MOST PART -- HAVE ADOPTED A RUN TO FAILURE. MIND SET WITH OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM CERTAIN PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WE'VE JUST HAD TO STOP MAINTAINING. WHEN THEY BREAK THEY GET REPLACED? WE HAVE A SEPARATE FUNDING SOURCE OF ABOUT SIXTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TO DEAL WITH OUR OWN. REPAIRS TO BROKEN EQUIPMENT IN OUR SO. THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THIS CASE. MAINTENANCE IS -- VERY MUCH APPRECIATED -- AS OF WHAT COKE INDICATED IT'S FOR FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS. IS A FOCUSED CURRENTLY ON RENEWING OR REPLACING THE SYSTEMS IN OUR HIGH RISE BUILDINGS. MOST OF THOSE BUILDINGS DATE BACK TO THE SIXTIES. AND SYSTEMS ARE ANTIQUATED. BREAK CONSTANTLY. RECENTLY WE HAD A FIRE ALARM PANEL. IN A COURTHOUSE IN SOUTHERN. BELLE WE SPENT NEARLY MILLION DOLLARS HAVE A FIRE WATCH WELL [inaudible] LACED [inaudible] FOR WE DO HERE. TO MITIGATE THAT. IS -- WILL REALLY HELP US. YOU ANY COMMENTS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- A I NEED EARLIER THE DEPART -- WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. AREN'T WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE REQUESTED AMOUNT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS. ON THE FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDED LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THAT THE JUDICIAL BRANCH REPORT NO LATER THAN JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON HOW THE DEFERRED BAT -- BACKLOG HAS CHANGED -- TO THE EXTENT THE BACKLOG ROSE THE LANGUAGE REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT ON THE REASONS FOR THAT GROWTH AND WHAT STEPS ARE BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS IT. AND THIS WILL REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE MONITOR THE ACTUAL ROUTINE ACTIVITY MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON AGAINST ACTUAL NEED. AND DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS IF ANY NEED TO BE MADE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE SECOND SET OF LANGUAGE WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO REPORT NO LATER THAN JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE ON THE ACTUAL PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED USING THIS MONEY AND THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS ARE USED ACCOUNT OF LEE AND CONSISTENT WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES -- THE REBEL ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF WHEN THE CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE FUNDS THAT YOU HAVE. AND ONE OF THE ONES I WAS QUESTIONING WAS THOUGH. THE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUN WHERE YOU'RE DRAWING DOWN SO. FUNDS FOR VARIOUS PROJECTS AND IT SAYS THAT THE IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AT A CERTAIN LEVEL FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS THAT'S GONNA DROP. AND WHAT IS THE I ALSO. HOW HOW DO YOU -- THE TERM IN. ABOUT THAT BUT PLAN TO YOU. ONE OF THE RESPONSE SO YOU CAN YOU GIVE ME THE IDEA WHERE THE MONEY COMES. IT'S LIKE GOING OVER THE DIFFERENT FUNDS IN TERMS OF THE INSTANT CENTER FROM ADDED THE SCS YOU HAVE TO STATE COURT. SO THIS CONSTRUCTION FUND -- THAT -- FUNDING THOSE LEVELS WERE PURSUANT TO A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND SO IS A MULTI YEAR ASPECT OF IT IN TERMS OF THAT FUNDING AND SO THAT WAS WHAT WAS OR IS THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. I KNOW I WOULD SAY IS THAT IN THE PAST WE'VE REQUESTED A GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PROGRAMS. BUT GIVEN THE THE FISCAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE STATE THE THE APPROVALS WERE OUT OF THESE FUNDS -- THESE REVENUES BOTH IN THE MEDIANCRITICAL NEED ACCOUNT AND THE THE S. S. C. F. ARE A COMBINATION OF CRIMINAL FEES AND CIVIL FILING FEES -- AND SO THEY'RE NOT STATE GENERAL FUND RESOURCES THEY ARE IN EFFECT TO THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGING IN THE SYSTEM -- SUPPORTING THESE TWO FUNDS A YEAH I MEAN BE WILLING OR UNWILLING. AS THE CASE MAY BE -- AND SO WE HAVE SPECIFIC APPROPRIATIONS -- FOR THESE DIFFERENT NEEDS BECAUSE THERE ARE DIFFERENT -- EXPENDITURES FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FIND SO THERE'S NO TORY EXPENDED -- GRAHAM DIED IN ITS REFLECT. THOSE FUNDS -- I BELIEVE I'M GOING TO GET YOU IN TERMS OF THE AND I CAN HAVE MY CAT MIKE -- EXPLAINED YOU SORT OF THE THE GENERAL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE MADE OUT OF THE FUNDS. IT DRIED OUT FUNDS FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES OR RIGHT. WANT TO SEE HOW THE LORD WITH -- LOOKS LIKE -- THE MADE ITS. CORD BASINS CONSTRUCTION PHONE. AS FOR RE PRIMARY USES THAT SERVICE FOR WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE US BE SEVENTEEN THIRTY TWO GRAHAM CONSTRUCTED NUMBER COURTHOUSES -- THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR REPAIRS TO BUILDINGS. AND THEN OUT ALSO FUNDS THE BASICS ALREADY IN OPERATION OF THE FACILITIES A DIVISION OF THE JEWS APARTMENT IN THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND THE BRANCH. AND THEN WE ALSO GET FUNDING FOR BUILDING REPAIRS OUT OF THE IMMEDIATE CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT. WHICH IS EXCLUSIVELY USE FOR THAT SERVICE IN THE US BE FORTINO SEVEN PROGRAM AND THEN TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR REPAIRS. OKAY SO -- WHAT OTHER MADE ITS FUNDS TO HAVE? DROVE. ONE THE STAKE CONTRIBUTE. WHO IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF GENERAL PHONE? OF THAT. GOES INTO THE MAINTENANCE BUDGET. THINK IT'S LESS THAN EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT'S A BELIEVE WHAT'S SO SHE HATED WITH JUDGESHIP PREVIOUSLY ON WHAT ARE THE BOUNCES. THE COURT FACILITIES TRUST FUND WE EXPAND THAT'S THE MAIN MAIN BUDGET. WE EXPAND TO THE WOMEN ALMOST EVERY YEAR THIS YEAR WE HAD A CARRYOVER OF ABOUT FIVE MILLION. AND THAT'S IN OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN. YEAH AND IN TERMS OF THE THE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EXPENDITURES AN APPROPRIATION THE THE REVENUES ARE BEING DEPLETED -- QUITE PRECIPITOUSLY IN THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUN AND THAT AND WHILE WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THE FUND BALANCE. A GIVEN THE DRAWS IN THE REVENUE IN BALANCE -- WE'RE PROJECTING AN INSOLVENCY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND SO WE WILL BE -- NEEDING SOME SOLUTIONS AS A STATE. FEES OR REVENUES. WERE EXAMINING THEM IN FOR A NO AS A THE ISSUE IS ARE IN MANY. YEAH I MEAN FOR EXAMPLE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE CRIMINAL FEES YOU'LL YOU'LL HAVE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE THE LAST FEW YEARS THOSE ARE DECLINING WE ARE NO NO DIFFERENT THE A AND M. AND FEELING THOSE IMPACTS. I'M IN SO THEY'LL DEFINITELY NEED TO BE -- SOLUTION AGAIN GIVEN THE CRITICALITY OF THE THE REVENUES MEETING THAT SERVICE AND AND MAINTAINING AN AND MANAGING THE FACILITIES THE MEDIAN CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT -- HAS A CURRENT BALANCE OF SORRY HOLD EACH. THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUT AND THAT AS ALSO DECLINING REVENUE -- BUT THAT'S NOT ANTICIPATED TO BE -- HAVE A SOLVENCY ISSUE AND FOR THE NEXT -- BUT ON YOURS. THE USE OF THAT THESE ARE NOT THESE OF FOR THE DEBT SERVICE THOSE ARE ALREADY PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. WE WERE VERY GRATEFUL AND THANKFUL THAT THIS LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION. MOVED -- KNEW OF MECHANISM TO FIND OUR CAPITAL PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION AND SO I'M TEN PROJECTS WERE APPROVED IN THIS MOST RECENT BUDGET -- TO BE FUNDED FROM DEBT SERVICE FUNDED BY THE GENERAL FUND STEADY. NO FOR THE AND FOR THESE PROGRAMS OF THEIR OF THEIR FAIRLY STEADY IT'S THE ISSUE OF THE AVAILABLE REVENUES IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WAS CREATED -- TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS AND THROUGH THE TWO BILLS THAT DID THAT -- SOME OF IF YOU WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BALANCES -- WHERE WOULD YOUR REVENUES VERSUS EXPENDITURES IS A LITTLE OFF THE CLIENT. RIGHT THAT LOSS EVERY YEAR CORRECT. WE CAN WE CAN PROVIDE YOU THE LONG -- TO YOU HAVE A TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION. FOR ME THAT'S YOU TODAY TELL US. HOW MUCH MONEY YOU NEED TO KEEP THEIR FROM GROWING? TREAD WATER NUMBER I CALLED. FOR ME YOU KNOW THIS IS A CALL TO TREAD WATER ANOTHER WORDS. YOUR YOUR DARKEST SINKING WHICH ARE NOT. WHAT IS THAT NUMBER? RIGHT ANSWERS CENTERS WE HAVE A WE DO B. C. P. THAT IS. ADDRESS TODAY THAT IS A HOSE OR MAINTENANCE FUNDING. THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY -- TO HELP. IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF MAINTENANCE ON A RECORDER. SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO IMPROVE THAT THAT BE CBS FOR FORTY MILLION CORRECT. ONE THERE'S ONE THIRTY TWO PROPOSALS IN THE BUDGET WHEN IS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR FORTY MILLION WHICH WOULD BE A ONE TIME INCREASE FOR THOSE CRITICAL -- FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS AND REPLACEMENT HOWEVER THERE'S AN ONGOING -- PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY POINT ONE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WOULD -- HELP US ON OUR MAINTENANCE GOING FORWARD IS WHAT -- MR COURTNEY'S REFERRING TO SO THIS TREAD WATER NUMBER. IT IS YOUR AGENTS THE BACKLOG GONNA GROW WITHOUT ERRORS. THE BACKLOG WILL STILL INCREASE OKAY WHAT'S THE NUMBER -- FOUR BACKLOG. NOT A CHRISTIAN YOU HAVE AN IDEA -- I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU OKAY LISTLESS LOOK IT UP I JUST WONDER FOR PURPOSES OF THAT CREATES A CLARITY FOR ME ABOUT. WHAT'S GOING ON AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE ILLEGAL. OF WHAT'S THE REASON THAT -- CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE THE REPORTING LANGUAGE -- THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT TWENTY TWENTY THREE DATE WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE THE REASON WHY SOME OTHER DATA EARLIER THIS. SURE IT PROVIDES A THEY HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME TO USE THE DOLLARS TO THE DOLLARS WON'T NECESSARILY ALL BE EXPENDED IN. TWENTY NINETEEN AND SO THE DATE OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS NO LATER IF THEY COMPLETE THE PROJECTS EARLIER AND THEY WANT TO SUBMIT A REPORT EARLIER IT'S A NO LATER THAT DAY. I I'M I'M TRYING NO. WELL WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHAT I NEED IF I CAN. GET THE MARK WHERE I CAN -- STOP THE BLEEDING IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT ON THEM THE MAID NEXT. I DON'T LIKE LOOKING FOR A NUMBER. KNOW WHERE I CAN -- I COULD LOOK AT THAT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT NOW BUT WE WANT. TO HELPS ME WHEN I ANALYZE A BUDGET. ON MAINTENANCE -- WHAT NUMBER WOULD BE SO I CAN -- ATTACK IT ATTACK THE PROBLEM THANK YOU. ENTER MORE LUCK THE MANAGER JUST HAD ONE QUESTION FOR MS LEE AND THAT IS. ARE YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THESE REPORTS ARE YOU ARE YOU DOING THIS JUST FOR THIS INSTANCE REFER ALL DEPARTMENTS. FOR ALL DEPARTMENTS -- WE ARE TAILORING OUR RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EACH OF THE BC PIECE THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING SO TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. THE JUDICIAL BRANCH SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED WHAT PROJECTS THEY WOULD FIND IN THIS REQUEST AND AND WALKED US THROUGH AND AND HAND CAN ARTICULATE THEIR PRIORITIZATION METHODOLOGY FOR SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS. SOME OF THAT INFORMATION IS LACKING AND SO WHEN THOSE BCP'S ARE HEARD THOSE ARE ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EXAMPLE THAT WOULD BE OFFERED BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING CONSISTENT ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE TO FOR ME. YOU THINK YOU MENTION CERTAINLY [inaudible] RIGHT -- GO AHEAD CENTER. IF YOU BUILD A NEW BUILDING IS THAT A THAT THE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BECAUSE AT STAKE IS THAT RIGHT RIGHT. SO YOU'RE REALLY CREATING A BRAND NEW. IN CENTER TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU COURTHOUSE WOULD PLACE ONE ARM OLD AGING COURTHOUSES THEN THAT. WOULD COME OFF THE BOOKS SO WHEN YOU CALCULATE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. TRACK THE ARE YOU REDUCE THE COST BY. FACT THE FACILITY. OF THIS FREEDOM MAY NOT. THAT'S CORRECT WE WOULD TAKE OLD BUILDING OUT OF THE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. FOLLOWING UP ON THAT WHAT YOU MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO US TO KNOW I MEAN GIVEN THAT THERE ARE. I'M SURE THEY'RE ALREADY PLANS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS. TO I'M I KNOW IT'S NOT A LOT BUT TO BUILD NEW COURTHOUSES OR TO ACQUIRE [inaudible] I'M. WE COULD HAVE SOME SENSE OF HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THAT BACKLOG BECAUSE IF WE'RE JUST READING THIS BACKLOG IS SOMETHING WE MUST FUND VERSUS SOMETHING THAT. WOULD BE REDUCED WHEN. A NEW COURT. BUILDING WAS -- PROCEEDED WITH WHICH MAY ALREADY BE PLANNED. FOR THAT HELPS US IN TERMS OF CALCULATING THOSE TYPES OF DECISIONS. SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE ALSO AND PERHAPS ILIO IN YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND. ON HOW WE WHAT WE ASK THEM TO IDENTIFY THAT COULD BE INCLUDED. HIS FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE COST [inaudible] I'M. RIGHT ADDITIONALLY -- CLEARLY THERE ARE LOTS OF DEMANDS ON OUR FOR ONE TIME ONLY FUNDS. BUT GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN A TIME. OF HIGHER REVENUES. HI REVENUES THAT WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO START APPROPRIATING. IN A IN A GUARANTEED ON GOING TYPE BASIS. HAS THE ARM JUDICIAL COUNCIL LOOKED AT ALL -- AROUND IN CENTERING SOME AMOUNT OF ONE TIME ONLY FUNDS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE BACKLOG. OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET LEVELS OF REPOSE I THINK AND SENATOR BELLS QUESTION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE A DIFFERENT SORT OF ARE THERE MORE OPTIONS AND ALSO WITHIN WHAT MIGHT BE THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS GOING FORWARD I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY SOME. MIX OF ADDITIONAL ONE TIME -- AND THEN LESSENING THE ONGOING NEED. BUT IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO RESPOND AS FAR AS WHETHER NOT NEW CONSTRUCTION MATTERS ON OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE -- PART OF YOUR BUDGET TRAILER BILLING WHICH IS REQUIRING AN ASSESSMENT OR REASSESSMENT OF ALL OF OUR FACILITIES AND IN IN THE EVALUATION OF THOSE NEW FACILITY NEEDS WE ARE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT ON OUR ON OUR MAIN IT'S NEAT [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] THAT. WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WHEN YOU GO TO OUR NEXT ITEM -- SO WE'RE NOW -- ON ISSUE [inaudible] FOR THE COURT [inaudible] PROCEEDINGS PROPOSAL AND THE RIGHT SO WE HAVE JOINED AT THE TABLE -- DON WILL WHO IS THE MANAGER AT THE CENTER FOR FAMILIES CHILDREN IN THE COURTS FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL DID I GET THAT CORRECT. ALRIGHT SO WHO WOULD LIKE TO START A DAY IN IN BRIEF -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE THE BUDGET PROPOSES A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE -- AND ONGOING FOR THIS PART THE COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY COUNCIL AND WORKLOAD AND THIS IS ON TOP OF A RECENT -- INCREASES OF THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF WHICH WE ARE YOU KNOW VERY THANKFUL AND WE ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATIVE OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AS PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET. AS IT WILL ALLOW US TO MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE THE TWO AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR DOWN THE FIGHT NEED -- FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE AND THE BENEFITS THAT IT WILL -- PROVIDE IN TERMS OF REDUCED -- CLIENT -- TO ATTORNEY RATIOS IN THIS AREA AND WE ARE HAVE HERE AS YOU SAID AND DONE WELL TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROGRAM THAT YOU MAY HAVE. BEFORE WE GO TO THAT BUT THE ITEM ALSO DESCRIBES THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL [inaudible] I'M. ITSELF IS DESCRIBED THAT THE TWENTY MILLION INCREASE REPRESENTS. 76% OF THE FUNDING NEED AS DETERMINED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL CAN YOU TALK A BIT ABOUT THAT. SO EITHER THE **** TALK ABOUT DISCERNING COUNTRY INTRICACIES OF THE THE THE THE MATH THERE. A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- ESTABLISH THE WORKLOAD BASED. ON THE MODEL FOR THE PENDENCY COUNCIL. WHICH TAKES INTO -- WHICH ASSETS A CASELOAD STANDARD OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE DEPENDENCY ATTORNEY SAID SAY -- MEDIAN STATE SALARY AND THEN USES ECONOMIC ACTORS AND THE CURRENT CHILD WELFARE CASE LOADING. BORN IN THE CURRENT RATE OF DEPENDENCY FILINGS AND COURTS IN CALIFORNIA WITH THAT WHAT IS REQUIRED. TO YOU HAVE ENOUGH ATTORNEYS TO SERVE ALL THE KIDS. WHO NEEDED TOURNEY'S AT A CASELOAD OF? FORTY ONE HER ATTORNEY. AND THAT -- THIS YEAR COMES TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE AND THE AMOUNT THAT -- AS YOU SEE THAT WE HAVE. THE END IS ABOUT -- THE SIX POINT. 76% OF THE TOTAL FUNDING [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] COLLEAGUES QUESTION. WENT TO THE TO THE LEVEL RECOMMENDED BE ABOUT FIFTY MILLION OR ABOVE THE THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE NUMBER. IS ABOUT. FIFTY SO THAT WOULD GIVE US THE ONE FORTY ONE NOW. HOW MUCH FLUCTUATIONS IS THE CASELOAD? HOW MUCH FLUCTUATION THIS OR THAT? YOUR BODY OR IS IT. THAT IS IT [inaudible] OF HOWEVER EACH COUNTY IT'S FAIRLY. OVER THE LAST DECADE -- GOING UP. FOR THAT ALANIZ FLUCTUATE BUT COUNCILS MODEL WITH -- SHIFT ALLOCATIONS OF FOR COUNTIES CASELOAD ONE COUNTY GOES UP AND ONE GOES DOWN YEAH. SO IS FIFTY MILLION SHORT BASICALLY THE THE TARGET. ONE BASED ON THAT. BASED ON A HUNDRED FORTY ONE CLIENTS PER ATTORNEY I'M. QUESTION I HAVE IS. YOU KNOW IN OUR PREVIOUS -- ITEMS. OF WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT. WHILE WE MAY ALLOCATE MONEY. THAT THE PERSONAL OR NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS HIRED. IT'S SO WHAT I'M WONDERING IS. DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THE ATTORNEYS NEEDED FOR THE GIVEN ME. AUGMENTATION OR NOT GIVEN THE FINES THAT HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED YOU OUT FOR THIS PURPOSE ARE THEY FULLY BEING UTILIZED. FOR THIS PURPOSE YES. THEY ARE RESTRICTED. THE TENNESSEE COUNCIL WHO. COURT. AND AND SO YEAH. WE ARE SPENDING ALL THE MONEY OKAY AND THERE'S NOT BEEN A SHORTAGE OF ATTORNEYS OR THERE'S NOT NOT FACE THAT SORT OF HING TOO WHEN THE WHEN THE WHEN WE RECEIVE THE AUGMENTATION. THE COURTS AND THE ATTORNEY FIRM A LITTLE WHILE TO CATCH UP AND RECRUIT NEW RETURN BUT WE DON'T LITTLE WHILE BEING HOW ABOUT WHAT. SIX MONTHS YEAH NINE MONTHS. THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT SO THE FIRST YEAR WE WERE. A LITTLE UNDER TOTAL SPENDNG AND AFTER THAT THE COURTS CADA AND THE ATTORNEY FIRM SO THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. SUPPLY PROBLEM THAT PERSPECTIVE. SO IF FOR EXAMPLE WE WERE ESSENTIALLY DO AUGMENTED BY A FULL SEVENTY MILLION MORE. IT WOULD TAKE YOU. I'M MAKING AN ASSUMPTION HERE YOU CAN CORRECT ME A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME THAN TO REALLY. THE RAMP UP -- I AM NOT SURE BECAUSE MOST OF THE MONEY. AND MOST OF THE CASES ARE IN LARGE URBAN AREAS. AND I THINK THAT -- AND THERE'S SERVED BY LARGER STREAM WE COMPETENT FIRMS. SO I REALLY THINK THAT THE POPE WOULD BE VERY FAST. ALL RIGHT BEFORE I ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS WANT TO MAKE ON THIS OKAY [inaudible] I'M. I'M SURE IF I MAY ASK HER YOU FINANCE -- AMAZON OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT -- THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF FUNDING DEPENDENCY COUNCIL WHICH IS BY THE BUDGET INCLUDES A TWO ON GOING TWENTY MILLION INVESTMENT -- IN THE QUARTER POINT IN THESE ATTORNEYS -- I DO WANT TO KNOW -- YOU KNOW IN DECEMBER WE RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT DEPENDENCY COUNCILS ELIGIBLE FOR TITLE FORTY FUNDING -- AND SO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS BEEN WORKING TOGETHER. TO MAKE SURE THE STATE CAN. I AND YOU KNOW THIS FUNDING CAN HELP REIMBURSE 50% OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR ATTORNEYS -- AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT CAN HELP SUPPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. WELL WHEN WE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME ISSUES AS TO WHETHER THAT FEDERAL FUNDING WOULD BE. TO BRING US UP TO SAY THE FULL FIFTY MILLION AUGMENTATION. SO IN OTHER WORDS THE ADDITIONAL. TWENTY FROM THE TWENTY MILLION YOU'RE RECOMMENDING ON GOING. ON AND SO WHEN WE RIGHT NOW WE'RE HOLDING THIS ITEM OPEN BUT WHEN WE REVISIT IT IF THERE COULD BE A LITTLE MORE -- WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT A LITTLE MORE ASSESSMENT AS TO HOW MUCH WE CAN. A POTENTIALLY RELY ON THAT WELL THERE [inaudible] OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- PUBLIC COMMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN LESLIE HI MY FROM CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WE ONE OF START BY ACKNOWLEDGING AND APPRECIATING THE TWENTY MILLION THAT WAS PUT INTO THE JANUARY BUDGET AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS. INCREASES -- IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN BUT ALSO WANT TO REITERATE AS THE AS MADAME CHAIR AS YOU NOTED THAT. IN TODAY AND IS IS NOTED IN TODAY'S ANALYSIS THAT UNTIL WE REACH THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVEN MILLION THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BASED ON THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL FORMULA. WE CONTINUE TO BE SEVERELY UNDERSTAFFED WITH AND I CARRY VERY IGH CASELOADS AND WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CLIENTS PER ATTORNEY WE SEE IT AS I'M NOT AS A GOLD STANDARD OR OR AS THE DESIRED CASELOAD -- BUT IT'S CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAXIMUM THAT ONE ATTORNEY CAN MANAGE WITH -- APPROPRIATE MULTI DISCIPLINARY SUPPORT STAFF AND IT IS EXAMPLE TO HELP YOU MAYBE THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE A GRANT FUNDED PROJECT WHERE WE SERVE SOME OF OUR MOST COMPLEX CLIENTS WHICH YOUR CHILDREN HAVE ALSO BEEN ARRESTED AND ARE INVOLVED WITH THE CHURCH THE DELINQUENCY COURT SYSTEM. AND WE STAFF THAT PROJECT WITH SIX TWO ATTORNEYS AND FOR CASE MANAGERS WHO SERVE BETWEEN THEM SIXTY CLIENTS AT ANY GIVEN TIME OBVIOUSLY MUCH SMALLER RATIOS THAN WHAT OUR STATE FUNDING COULD EVER ALLOW. FOR BUT AS A RESULT OF THAT INTENSITY OF THE INTENSIVE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THOSE CHILDREN WE HAVE VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED THE FOSTER CARE TO PRISON PIPELINE FOR THOSE SIXTY CHILDREN WE HAVE ONE CHILD IN THREE YEARS WHO WENT INTO ADULT. THE INTO THE ADULT CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHICH IS REMARKABLE WE THINK -- IN ONLY TWO THAT FOUND THEMSELVES IN CAMPS 86% COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL ARE THERE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR HAVE COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL AND ALL OF THE GRADUATES ARE WORKING OR IN COLLEGE. WHICH IS REMARKABLE AS I SAID FOR YOUTH WHO ARE DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH BOTH THE CHILD WELFARE AND THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE LEARNED IN THE PAST FIVE AND THAT WE ARE POISED TO IMPLEMENT IN ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS STATEWIDE -- MANY OF HER PROGRAMS -- BUT WE CAN'T WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND WITHOUT THE FUNDS TO NOT ONLY HIRE LAWYERS BUT TO ALSO HIRED THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY STAFF THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT YOU RAISED DURING THE QUESTIONING -- THE FIRST BEING OVERALL NUMBERS AND WHILE WE AGREE THAT WE GENERALLY HOWEVER AT A AT A STABLE CASELOAD THERE'S RESEARCH FROM THE CHILDREN'S DATA NETWORK AT USC -- THAT PROJECTS IN ON A STEADY A SLOW BUT STEADY INCREASE IN THE CHILD WELFARE POPULATION. IN THE COMING YEARS -- AND THAT'S BASED ON VERY COMPLEX LONGITUDINAL STUDIES AND ASSESSMENTS OF STATE DATA COUNTY DATA. AND SO ON AND IS THE CHILDREN'S DATA NETWORK IS AT USC AS I SAID AND IS DEDICATED TO STUDYING CHILD WELFARE ON AND MAY HAVE PUSHED PROVIDED SOME RESEARCH ON THAT. WITH REGARD TO HIRING WELL WE DON'T HAVE THE OVERALL SUPPLY PROBLEM THAT WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER THERE ARE SOME POCKETS NORTHERN AND RURAL COUNTIES WHERE IT SOME WHERE A SINGLE POSITION MAY REMAIN. VACANT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BUT WE SOLUTION TO THAT IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET INCREASE BECAUSE THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT THE ATTORNEYS DON'T EXIST BUT THE VAGUE THERE ARE WAGES ARE NOT COMPETITIVE. SO THE INCREASE AND THE WORK AND THE PROSPECT OF TAKING ON AN OVERWHELMING CASELOAD SCARES PEOPLE AWAY WROTE REALISTICALLY. SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE AUGMENTATION -- WILL SOLVE THAT PROBLEM SIGNIFICANTLY -- WHEN MR WELL SPOKE ABOUT THE LARGE URBAN AREAS WHERE WE ARE POISED TO GO I'M PRETTY SURE HOUZZ MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT MY ORGANIZATION -- CLC REPRESENTS OVER ALMOST HALF THE CHILDREN IN THE WHOLE STATE -- AND WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY STAFF BETWEEN OUR THREE COUNTIES -- AND WE ARE ABSOLUTELY READY TO GO AND BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE IS I WOULD SAY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WE LEARNED VERY QUICKLY WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WE HIRED -- CLOSE TO FORTY ATTORNEYS -- WITH THE RECENT INCREASES AS WELL AS SUPPORT STAFF TO GO ALONG WITH THAT AND WERE ABLE TO CREATE OUR SPECIALIZED COLLABORATIVE UNIT. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF MIDDLE MANAGERS THAT ARE VERY READY TO MOVE UP IN A LOT OF SENIOR ATTORNEYS THAT ARE VERY READY ALSO TO TAKE ON THOSE ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES. AND AGAIN IF WE CAN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS HAPPY. HELLO I AM A IN WITH EAST BAY FAMILY DEFENDERS THAT WE ARE THE NEW LEGAL REPRESENTATION PROVIDER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR ALL CHILDREN ALL I'M SORRY ALL PARENTS AND SOME CHILDREN WITH OPEN CHILD WELFARE CASES. WE LAUNCHED OUR ORGANIZATION IN SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR AT A HISTORIC LOW IN STATE FUNDING. AND WE LAUNCHED IT BECAUSE WE WERE REALLY INSPIRED -- BY EIGHT EIGHT SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT INVESTMENT IN HIGH QUALITY REPRESENTATION FOR FAMILIES AND DEPENDENCY COURT ADVANCES THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEMS GOALS. OF INSURING CHILD SAFETY -- MEN'S AND WELLBEING SPECIFICALLY RESEARCH DEMONSTRATED THAT HIGH QUALITY REPRESENTATION FOR CHILDREN AND PARENTS IN THESE PROCEEDINGS REDUCES SAFELY REDUCES RELIANCE ON FOSTER CARE. SHORTENS THE STAYS THE OLDER IN IN FOSTER CARE PROMOTES SAFER UNIFICATION TIMELY REUNIFICATION OF CHILDREN WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND OTHER PERMANENT GOALS SUCH AS GUARDIANSHIP AND ADOPTION. AND RESULTS IN LONG TERM COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE REDUCED RELIANCE ON POSSIBLY OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT. IN ADDITION IT IMPROVES THE RELIABILITY AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATION PROVIDED TO JUDGES WHEN THEY MAKE LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS ABOUT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. THERE IS REALLY NO OTHER OR VERY FEW OTHER LEGAL CASE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH ARE INADEQUATE LAWYERING CAN. POTENTIALLY RESULT IN THE DERAILMENT OF A PERSON'S LIFE IN WAYS FROM WHICH THEY MAY NEVER RECOVER. SO WE ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED BY THE RESEARCH THAT DEMONSTRATES WHAT WE COULD DO WE WE CANNOT DO IT A CURRENT FUNDING LEVELS. AND SO WE IMPLORE THE STATE TO REACH THIS FOR THIS MINIMAL SUFFICIENT FLOOR OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE CASES PER YEAR. HER ATTORNEY IS HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MY NAME IS -- ERIN HYMAN AND I'M A MENTOR PARENT WITH DACK -- DEPENDENCY FC CENTER AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR DEPENDENCY.

I WORK CLOSELY WITH MY DEPEND TO LAWYER MEETING WEEKLY YOU GO OVER MY BARRIERS AS WELL AS A TEAM AND DEPENDENCY WELLNESS CORE. I WAS INFORMED OF TREATMENT AND PROGRAM THE DID NOT KNOW EXISTED IT WOULD HELP ME ACHIEVE LONG TERM SOBRIETY. WITHOUT THE WRITTEN THERE WITHOUT TE SUPPORT I RECEIVED FROM MY MENTOR PARENT WHO WORKS WITH MY LAWYER. I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY -- I NEED. I NEEDED I WAS THAT I'M SORRY I WAS ABLE TO REUNIFY WITH MY SON MAINTAIN LONG TERM SOBRIETY MAINTAIN GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT AND CARE FOR MY YOUNGEST SON.

THEY HELPED CHANGE MY LIFE AND THE LIFE. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS JOHN MACK ATTORNEY I AM FROM THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO WE MANAGE THE COURT APPOINTED DEPENDENCY PANEL REPRESENTING ALL CHILDREN. AND ALL PARENTS IN SAN FRANCISCO -- AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE BEING IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE APPRECIATE THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION THAT'S ON THE TABLE. WE DO. I'M ALSO NEED TO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THAT ADDITIONAL FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR -- I THE PROVIDERS YOU KNOW WE WE ALL TALK WITH ONE ANOTHER VERY REGULARLY I CAN ASSURE. THE SENATORS AND THE MADAM CHAIR THAT WE ABSOLUTELY CAN SPEND THE MONEY -- WE HAVE BEEN IN A HOLE. FOR DECADES AND THAT MONEY WE ARE POISED AND READY TO GO IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE -- TO GIVE OUR ATTORNEYS A RAISE AN ELEVEN HERE. SO THIS IS AN URGENT NEED AGAIN THE ONE FORTY ONE CASE LOAD STANDARD IS A MINIMUM STANDARD I'M SORRY THE MAXIMUM STANDARD THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL HAS TARGETED. WITH IF -- ONCE WE DO FIND OUT WHAT THE FORTY DOLLARS LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF A MATCH THAT WOULD GO A LOT FARTHER IN TERMS OF REACHING THE IDEAL STANDARD. I OUTLINED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL -- I'M. SEVENTY SEVEN I DO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON WHAT ARE THE PRIOR SPEAKERS EXPERIENCE WAS IN THE JUVENILE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM AND MAKE SURE THAT. THIS COMMITTEE UNDERSTANDS THAT. THE WORK THAT WAS INVOLVED IN NOT SUCCESS STORY IS ABOUT ATTORNEY TIME INVESTING THAT ATTORNEY TIME FOR ONE PARTICULAR CLIENT. I RIGHT NOW WITH THE CURRENT STANDARDS WE HAVE TO PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH CLIENTS WE CAN GIVE THAT LEVEL OF TIME AND ATTENTION. TO IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT KIND OF OUTCOME POSSIBLE FOR THAT FAMILY AND FOR ALL OF THE SUCCESS STORIES THAT WE'VE JUST HEARD ABOUT. THERE ARE MANY MORE THAT DON'T GET THAT TIME AND ATTENTION AND THOSE CHILDREN CAN WIND UP BEING A BURDEN FINANCIALLY AND SOCIALLY ON THE STATE. FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES SO IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT DOING MORALLY WHAT IT THE RIGHT THING IS IT'S ABOUT. UNDERSTANDING THE COST BENEFITS SAID NOT SUPPLYING FULL FUNDING FOR THESE LAWYERS MEANS. JUST SPENDING THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE -- IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING NOT FOSTER CARE PAYMENT PLANS. FOR UP TO TWENTY ONE YEARS AND THEN NOT HOT BE ABLE FOR THAT. PERSON TO YOU KNOW ECONOMICALLY SUPPORT THEMSELVES FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. SO THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE DEPENDENCY ADVOCACY CENTER IN SAN JOSE -- DISORGANIZATION YOU'VE JUST HEARD A SUCCESS STORY FROM ONE OF THE PARENTS TO RECEIVE -- COMPASSIONATE AND AND THOUGHTFUL REPRESENTATION FROM THE CENTER IN THE LAST TEN YEARS -- THE CENTER HAS PROVIDED COURT APPOINTED REPRESENTATION FOR OVER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AT PARENTS AND CHILDREN WO ARE BEING SERVED IN THE DEPENDENCY SYSTEM IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY -- THE THE DEPENDENCY ADVOCACY CENTER IS PART OF A VERY COLLABORATIVE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA THEY ARE VERY COMMITTED -- TO THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY -- AND CERTAINLY JOIN IN THE COALITION EFFORT TO SEEK THIS IDENTIFIED GAP OF SEVENTY MILLION WITH GREAT GRATITUDE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITMENT OF OF TWENTY MILLION TO GET US PART WAY THERE -- BUT THE FULL FUNDING WOULD WHAT AS YOU HAVE HEARD BRING US TO A MORE MANAGEABLE WORKLOAD OF ONE FORTY ONE THE DEPENDENCY ADVOCACY CENTER -- PROVIDES COMPASSIONATE REPRESENTATION UNDER VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CERTAINLY RECOGNIZES OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE RESEARCH WOULD DEMONSTRATE MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES WITH THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I'M FINALLY I ALSO WANT TO MENTION FOR A DIFFERENT GROUP OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA IS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR DEPENDENCY COUNCILS. FOR THE REASONS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SIR HAVING. NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU WHO -- CAME TODAY IN X.. GAVE US -- INFORMATION AND EXPRESSED VIEWS AND I WANNA THANK YOU BOTH. FOR THE INFORMATION PROVIDED AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE. FIVE WHICH IS OUR PRE TRIAL. PRE. DECISION MAKING PILOT. I WAS JUST THINKING AS I SPOKE OUT SOMEBODY WAS. TRANSLATING ELECTRONICALLY WHAT I SAY PROBABLY COME OUT PRETTY GARBLED AT TIMES ANYWAY ESPECIALLY -- WHATEVER -- THE SO OUR SPEAKERS FOR THAT FREE TRIAL DECISION MAKING I LET. OUR LUCY FOGARTY THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF BUDGET SERVICES AT JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND SHELLY CURRENT THE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SO [inaudible] BEGIN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M THE END OF YOUR DAUGHTER TODAY IS RELATED TO A SEVEN TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION OVER TWO YEARS. TO FUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OPERATION OR EVALUATION OF PROGRAMS OR IF IT'S AN EIGHT TO TEN CHORDS RELATED TO PRE TRIAL DECISION MAKING. AND AS YOU QUICKLY INDICATED I HAVE SURELY HEAD TO ASSIST WITH ANY QUESTIONS. SURE IF YOU WANT TO ADD ADDITIONAL. GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD ADD IS THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- TO CONTINUE THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS HAPPENED -- AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS IT RELATES TO PRE TRIAL DECISION MAKING AND ALSO TO RECOGNIZE THAT -- PRE TRIAL DECISION MAKING IS CHE LEE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S THROUGH LEGISLATION THAT IS PASSED OR LAWSUITS -- THAT ARE OCCURRING RIGHT NOW -- AND INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. OR YOU MAY HAVE SOME COMMENTS BUT ON ACID FEW QUESTIONS FIRST YOU DON'T MIND I'M. SO IN THE IN OUR MATERIALS WERE DISCUSSES PROPOSE BILL LANGUAGE IT INDICATES THAT 10% OF THIS REQUEST WOULD BE USED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. FOR COSTS OF EVALUATING IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING THE PROGRAMS BUT THIS IS ALSO IN EFFECT. A TWO YEAR PILOT. SO. WHAT I'M WONDERING IS HOW HOW EFFECTIVELY ONE CAN EVALUATE? SOMETHING THAT. ASSUMING SAY IT THIS IS FUNDED. WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO JULY ONE OF THIS YEAR WHICH THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO GET GOING. AND SO -- YOU COULD PROBABLY NUMBER MONTHS BEFORE IT'S REALLY GOTTEN GOING IN SO HOW DO YOU EVALUATE. ITS EFFECTIVENESS ON SO IF YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT YOUR THANK YOU -- THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION IN ANTICIPATION OF THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE THOSE DOLLARS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL BUT THEN AGAIN UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT IT IS NOT DONE UNTIL IT UNTIL THE GOVERNOR SIGNS AT NIGHT AFTER THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE IN. JANUARY -- APPOINTED A REFORM OPERATIONS WORK GROUP AND THAT GROUP ONE OF ITS CHARGES IS LOOKING AT THAT THE PROPOSED PILOT AND COMING UP WITH A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR CONSIDERATION BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AT ITS JULY MEETING HOPEFULLY -- IN ORDER TO GET THOSE PILOTS UP AND RUNNING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND SO THAT GROUP RIGHT NOW IS -- COMING UP WITH A LIST OF CRITERIA -- BASED UPON WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE BUDGET THE LANGUAGE -- AND WHAT IS -- THE THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRE TRIAL DETENTION REFORMS WORKGROUP THE CHIEF JUSTICE'S LAST GROUP THAT LOOKED AT THIS -- AND LESSONS THAT I'VE BEEN LEARNED FROM RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FUND I'M LOOKING AT THAT AND COMING UP WITH AN APPLICATION PROCESS IN ORDER. TO SEND THAT OUT TO THE COURTS IN ANTICIPATION WITH THE HOPE THAT ON THE COUNCIL WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS AT ITS JANUARY MEETING RECOGNIZING THAT TWO YEARS IS A VERY QUICK TIME FRAME. ADDITIONALLY WITH THE DOLLARS THAT -- ARE COMING TO THE JUDGE ANSEL MONEY THAT -- THOSE THOSE FUNDS WILL GO TOWARDS IS COMING UP WITH THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO COLLECT THE DATA FROM THE COURTS SO THAT WE CAN TURN AROUND AND EVALUATE THAT PROGRAM -- AS THE DATA IS COMING IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. GIVEN OUT WE HAVE ALREADY. FORTY SIX OUT OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT BY OUR COUNTIES. BY YOUR ESTIMATION JUDICIAL COUNCILS ESTIMATION THAT ALREADY DOES SOME LEVEL OF PRE TRIAL ASSESSMENT RISK ASSESSMENT. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THESE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS AREN'T NECESSARILY UNIFORM -- COUNTY X. RECORD EXCUSES THIS. ONE COURT WHY USES THAT ONE I'M. WHY WOULDN'T WE START TO EVALUATE? ONES THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WHY WOULD WE BE USING THIS MONEY RATHER THAN I MEAN IN FACT WE HAVE PILOTS. RIGHT WE GOT PILOTS GOING ON ENOUGH FORTY SIX COUNTIES. NOW THEY'RE NOT UNIFORM. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IS IT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE UNIFORM EITHER [inaudible] SO. IF IF PART OF OUR OBJECTIVE IN THIS IS PART OF MY QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE THIS PART OF OUR OBJECTIVE IS. TO BEGIN TO LAND ON THE MOST EFFECTIVE. PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT -- SO THAT IN THE YOU KNOW WE KNOW. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL ITSELF ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED AS EARLY AS I THINK WAS TWENTY SEVENTEEN MIGHT'VE BEEN EARLIER. THAT -- OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF OF BAIL WAS DISCRIMINATORY ON THOSE WHO ARE LOW INCOME AND SO AND IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY. THAT ARE IF WE THINK ABOUT WHAT IS OUR PURPOSE OUR PURPOSE IS PUBLIC SAFETY. WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THOSE -- PEOPLE HAT ARE CHARGED WITH SOMETHING THAT ARE AT THAT WOULD MEAN MOST LIKELY. CONTINUE TO OFFEND OR BE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. OURS ARE THAT WERE PROTECTED FROM THAT AND OTHERWISE THE ASSUMPTION IS YOU ARE INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY. SO IT SEEMS TO ME GIVEN THAT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS YOU KNOW ALREADY HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT THIS AND CLEARLY LOTS OF OUR COURTS HAVE. WHY WOULD WE BE NOW TRYING TO YOU ARE. IDENTIFY A I DON'T KNOW SOME NUMBER OF THESE COUNTIES OR ALREADY ENGAGED IN SOME LEVEL OF THIS ACTIVITY. AND THEN BE EVALUATING THEM SO THAT WE COULD. YEAH SO YES THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M THE CHIEF DESCRIBE THE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THE WAY THAT YOU DID SHE SAID THAT IT WAS UNSAFE AND UNFAIR RIGHT SO IT'S AND IT DOESN'T WORK IN TERMS OF ALL IS NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS COULD BE. IN TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND IT'S UP POTENTIALLY COULD PENALIZED FOR PEOPLE FOR BEING POOR -- SO IN TERMS OF STUDYING THIS -- WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING WELL FUNDED THE RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FUND SEVERAL YEARS AGO NOW AND BY THIS FALL WE ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT LOOKS AT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WERE FROM -- FUNDED BOTH FOR COLLABORATIVE WORDS AND FOR PRE TRIAL WE'VE ELEVEN PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS -- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW OF DOING A MUCH DEEPER DIVE INTO -- SIX OF TOSE PRE TRIAL PROGRAMS AND WHEN I SAY A DEEPER DIVE I MEAN WE ARE COLLECTING DATA FROM LOCAL JAILS WE ARE COLLECTING DATA FROM THE CAL DOJ AND WE'RE COLLECTING ADDITIONAL DATA FROM THE COURTS IN ORDER TO LOOK AT THOSE PROGRAMS -- AND PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS VERSUS PEOPLE WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS AND REALLY MEASURE BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND RETURN TO COURT I THINK WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS AND THE OTHER -- FORTY SIX PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE VERSUS WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED RIGHT NOW IS PART OF THE BUDGET IS THIS IS A MUCH DEEPER DIVE -- WE ANTICIPATE WHAT -- GOING INTO THIS COUNTY IS FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR EIGHT TO TEN PLACES IS IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY AND AND WE THINK BECAUSE OF THAT. WE ENVISION PROGRAMS WHERE -- ASSESS YOU KNOW P. ELIGIBLE FOR WILL BE WILL BE ASSESSED -- IT WILL PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO -- A DEEPER DIVE ABOUT VALIDATION OF THOSE TOOLS YOU MENTION THE FORTY SIX FORTY SIX PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW WHERE WHERE TOOLS ARE BEING USED. I'M IN VERY FW HAVE THE TOOLS ACTUALLY BEEN VALIDATED ON THEIR LOCAL POPULATIONS AND SO PART OF THIS PROGRAM WILL ALSO BE VALIDATING THOSE TOOLS -- ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RUN INTO -- WITH WITH THAT WHAT I CAN THE BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RUN INTO BUT ISSUE THAT OUR RECIDIVISM REDUCTION FUN COURTS HAVE IDENTIFIED IS. THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION AND DATA EXCHANGE SO THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE FOR A COLLABORATION AND HAVE OPERATION AMONG LOCAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTNERS. THROUGH DATA EXCHANGES AND WE ANTICIPATE THE DOLLARS WILL GO TO THE COURTS SO THAT PROVISION IN THE JAILS IN THE COURTS CAN CAN TALK TO EACH OTHER. HOW THAT INFORMATION SHARED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL SO THE DECISIONS CAN BE MADE MORE QUICKLY AND THEN THAT WILL ALSO ENABLE US AT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL LEVEL TO GO IN AND PULL THAT DATA AND DO A DEEPER ANALYSIS AND WERE ABLE TO DO RIGHT NOW AS IT RELATES TO ISSUES? THAT I THINK ARE I KNOW ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ALSO THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND AND THE ADMINISTRATION AROUND POTENTIAL BIAS IN THE TOOLS. BUT IF YOU DESCRIBE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE DOING THIS DEEPER DIVE AND THIS IS YOU KNOW THIS THE GRANT PROGRAM [inaudible] ARE YOU. ARE YOU GOING TO BE JUST ASSESSING [inaudible] THOSE TOOLS. THAT RISK ASSESSMENT THAT WHATEVER COUNTIES ARE AWARDED ARE ALREADY USING. OR DO YOU HAVE A OR YOUR IS THERE GOING TO BE RECOMMENDED AT A CERTAIN PART OF THE QUESTION IS. WE HAVEN'T REALLY VALUE WITH THESE TOOLS. AND MAYBE THERE HAS MAYBE THERE IS A BEST PRACTICE SOMEWHERE WOULD WE BE ASKING CERTAIN COURTS THAT WE FUNDED. TO UTILIZE TOOL EXOR TOOL WHY SO THAT WE COULD THEN COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF TOOL EXOR TOOL WHY ME WHAT IS IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE FROM LATE YES SO SO A VARIETY OF COURTS -- WILL BE WILL BE ONE OF THE SO WITH SIMILAR TO ARE THERE WHEN YOU SAVE RIGHT OF COURT SO MEANING WHAT THEY'RE ALREADY USING. I I MEAN A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS IN PART DIFFERENCE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS RIGHT SO DIFFERENT COURT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THAT ANYTHING THAT WE LEARN AND ANY -- IN PLACE FOR A MAJOR COURT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WE CAN REPLICATE THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT'S ONE ANOTHER IS QUART SIZE RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE SOME COURTS THAT ARE REALLY REALLY LARGE AND OTHER COURTS THAT ARE YOU KNOW TWO TO FIVE JUDGES IN THE STATE AND SO MAKING SURE THAT. WE HAVE A DIVERSITY OF THOSE COURTS LOOKING AT NORTHERN STATES. FAITH NORTHERN CHORDS SOUTHERN COURTS A COASTAL AND AND RURAL ALSO SO LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THAT I ONLY SEE GOD SAY'S IT SO YES. WE HAVE GEOGRAPHIC DIFFERENCES BUT DO WE ARE THOSE. ARE THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE COURTS AN INDICATOR OF WHETHER THEY'RE USING A DIFFERENT RISK ASSESSMENT FREE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL OR NOT OR SO I GUESS WHAT I'M REALLY TRYING TO GET AT YOU HAVEN'T MENTIONED YET IS. PART OF THIS PILOT IS. TO GIVE US BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRE TRIAL RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO ARE WE GOING TO BE. MEAN OR GONNA BE COMPARING. APPLE'S INCOME QUOTES AND PINEAPPLES OR SO ARE WE IS PART OF THE CRITERIA THAT. ALL OF THE PILOT. ALL USING DIFFERENT ASSESSMENT TOOL SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH MIGHT BE. THE MOST USEFUL OR ARE WE GOING TO BE RECOMMENDING CERTAIN ASSESSMENT TOOLS SO THAT THEN WERE EVALUATING WHETHER. IDENTIFIED ASSESSMENT TOOLS. IN YOU CELLS WERE SOMETHING YOU KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE THE BEST PRACTICE OR NOT. YES SO LIGHT I UNDERSTAND -- I SHOULD SAY THAT -- THIS PRE TRIAL OF REFORM OPERATIONS WORKGROUP PROWESS OR CALLING IT IS IS THE GROUP THAT REALLY IS DEVELOPING. THE APPLICATION AND THE AND THE CRITERIA BASED UPON THE THINGS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED TO DATE. HAVE HAVE DISCUSSED THE BENEFIT OF LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF TOOLS -- THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM I SHOULD SAY THE ANOTHER PRIORITY OF THIS GROUP ANOTHER CHARGE OF THE GROUP FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL THE CHIEF. IS LOOKING AT I'VE INTO THESE TOOLS AS YOU MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY TOOLS THAT ARE BEING OUT THERE NOT ONLY ARE THERE DIFFERENT TOOLS WITH THE TOOLS ARE ARE BEING MODIFIED IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES BECAUSE OF DIFFERENT COUNTY CULTURES. AND SO WHAT THAT GROUP IS DOING SIMULTANEOUSLY TO THE WORK THAT IT'S DOING AROUND THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION IS LOOKING AT THOSE TOOLS AND COMING UP I ANTICIPATE THAT THEY'LL BE COMING UP WITH THE SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR TRIAL COURTS TO CONSIDER WHEN THEY'RE ADOPTING THESE COOL TOOLS AND SO WHAT -- THAT THEY WERE BEING ASKED -- TO OKAY FUNNY BEFORE THAT'S BEFORE YOU REALLY WORKED THAT OUT BUT IT JUST COMMENT. I'M. I NOTE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT A DIFFERENT. NOT SURE IF YOU SAID. OR CULTURES ARE COUNTY CULTURES VERB. CLEARLY THERE IS -- OBVIOUSLY VARIATIONS IN THE IN THE DEFENDANTS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD AND SAY REGION X. OR Y. THOUGH IF OUR OBJECTIVE. OUR PURPOSE FOR THIS. IS TO HELP US [inaudible] BETTER. UNDERSTAND EFFECTIVE TOOLS FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVE OF OF SO MINIMIZING. MINIMIZING EITHER HOLDING PEOPLE ARE CHARGING THEM BAIL IF THEY'RE NOT. A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK. AND YES THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME FACTORS THAT ARE -- NO MY TWO VAX VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THAT THERE'S HUGE AMOUNT. OF FACTORS THAT ARE GONNA VERY GEOGRAPHICALLY THAT WHEN WE'RE GETTING RIGHT DO WHEN WE GET DOWN TO THE BASIS OF OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE IS THAT ACHIEVING THE PUBLIC SAFETY. SO I GUESS WHERE I'M GOING IS WHAT YOU KNOW ARE WE IF I FIND A PILOT I WANT TO KNOW THAT WE ARE MORE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO YOU BOTH WHAT THE CRITERIA IS OF WHAT WE WE HOW YOU VALUE IT HAD A FUNDED. WHAT'S OUR OBJECT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I I WOULD SAY THAT THE OBJECTIVES ARE THREEFOLD ONE IS -- TO BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS-OF PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO PRE TRIAL RELEASE RIGHTS WILL BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE AND MEASURING THAT. A SECOND IS RETURNED TO COURT AND TO HAVING SUCCESSFUL -- IN TERMS OF RETURN TO COURT THAT THE DEFENDANTS COME TO COURT WHEN THE DEFENDANTS ARE REQUIRED. TO MITIGATING BIAS IS ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM IN SO DOING THAT LOOK AND SEEING IF THERE IS BIAS IN THE SYSTEM WHERE THERE IS BIAS IN THE SYSTEM AND HOW IT IS THAT THAT WE CAN WORK. TO REDUCE THAT BIAS ANOTHER ANOTHER YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK AND THEN ONCE WE LEARN WHAT WORKS WE CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION AND SHARE THOSE BEST PRACTICES AMONG THE COURTS. AND INFORM -- THE POLICY MAKERS. SO PART OF MY QUESTION THEN IS THAT NOTION OF WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK. I'M NOT TRYING TO PRESUPPOSE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WORKS. BUT CERTAINLY. AND I ALSO DON'T KNOW WHETHER HOW MUCH UNIFORMITY THERE MIGHT BE. IN THESE FORTY EIGHT BACK HER JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE USING THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF RISK ASSESSMENT IN PRE TRIAL I'M -- BUT IT SEEMS THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME STUDIES. THAT [inaudible] FOR SOME. AS THEIR FAVORITE TURNED OUT EVIDENCE BASED. INDICATORS OF WHAT'S. WHAT MAKES SOME REMOTE MAKES THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY MORE EFFECTIVE SO WOULDN'T WE WANT TO BE? ENSURING THAT ANY PILOTS WE ARE FINDING ARE HELPING US OF THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD. TO DATE AS BEING THE MOST EFFECTIVE SO THAT WE CAN THEN. HAVE THE EVIDENCE THAT IN FACT THEY ARE FOR US. YES AND AND THE LANGUAGE EXPERT TALKS ABOUT VALIDATED TOOLS AND IT TALKS ABOUT -- QUICK DECISION MAKING RIGHT SO SO STUDIES HAVE COME OUT THAT SHOW THE IMPACT WHEN SOMEONE IS DETAINED PRE TRIAL AND AND LITERALLY BY THE DAYS THE IMPACT THAT HAS ON THEIR FAMILIES ON THEIR JOBS OF SOMEONE'S CAR IS TOTALED THINGS LIKE THAT THAT THAT. PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK OF IMMEDIATELY WHAT THE IMPACT IS AND SELL PART ANOTHER OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE -- RIGHT NOW IS QUICKER DECISIONS BY JUDICIAL OFFICERS IN SO DOING WHAT WE CAN AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS THROUGH I. T. MAKING SURE THAT RISK ASSESSMENT IS DONE. MOST OF ALL OF THE REQUEST YOUR BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WERE ALL I. T. SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS PILOT IS NOT PRIMARILY REQUESTS FOR IT. I I JUST IN TERMS OF THE MONTH THE DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO BE GOING TO THE COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN HELP THE COURTS. GET THAT IN INFORMATION EXCHANGE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IT CAN COME TO A JUDICIAL OFFICER SO JUDICIAL OFFICER CAN MAKE THAT DECISION. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY RETURN TO COURT AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS SAFE TO BE TO BE RELEASED PRE TRIAL -- THAT THEY ARE SAFE TO BE RELEASED AND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE -- TO LIVE WITH AND AND DEAL WITH THE VERY EXPENSIVE COSTS OF OF COMMERCIAL BAIL BONDS IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET PEOPLE OUT SOONER. I AM SURE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS APOLOGIES -- DOMINATING THIS BUTTON PERHAPS. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I RACED WERE ONES THAT IN OUR MATERIALS EVEN LA ALWAYS RAISE BUT LA YOU IF YOU WANT. TO ADD RIGHT NOW. HAPPY BEFORE. EIGHT AS MY COLLEAGUES AS SOME OTHER QUESTIONS. ABSOLUTELY -- SO WE ARE RECOMMENDING THAT THE LEGISLATURE DRUGS BUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND JUDICIAL CUT COUNCILS THE MIDDLE MOORE WELL DEVELOPED -- PROPOSAL BY APRIL FIFTEENTH WE CAN CONSIDER IT AS PART OF YOUR SPRING DELIBERATIONS -- AND WE RECOMMENDED THIS BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT THE PROGRAM COULD BE WORTHWHILE THERE IS POSSIBILITY BUT REALLY THE FAULT OF THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION. TO EVALUATE IT AND WEIGHED AGAINST OTHER GENERAL SPECIFICALLY THE KEY INFORMATION THAT WE THOUGHT NEEDED TO BE ANSWERED SOME OF WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY RAISED BY MADAM CHAIR. IS YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE PROGRAM WHAT ARE THE ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD BE FUNDED AND HOW ARE THEY ALIGN WITH THOSE GOALS HOW IS THE FUNDING TO BE ALLOCATED. AND THEN FINALLY HOW WE ENSURE THAT THE FUNDED PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ARE GONNA BE A VALUED IN A WAY THAT INFORMS STATEWIDE DECISION MAKING. WAS WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE FOUND THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EFFECTIVELY EVALUATE WHETHER IT WAS STRUCTURED OPERATED AND FUNDED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD REFLECT. LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND MEET LEGISLATIVE EXPECTATIONS. SO -- WE DO WITH HOLD RECOMMENDATION PENDING THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE EXTENT THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS NOT PROVIDED WE DO RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU SENATOR MARLA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING WITH US SENATOR BATES FOR EIGHT YEARS. AS A FELLOW SUPERVISOR. AND SHE KEPT USING THE TERM. THIS IS THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS NOT COOKED IN. I THINK THAT CAME FROM HER EXPERIENCE AT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND IS IT SEEMS LIKE I'M HEARING A LOT MORE HERE ARE IN SACRAMENTO THE CAPITAL NOT COOKED IN A MY CART AND SO I SORT OF AGREE WITH WHERE THE CHURCH GOING AND I AGREE WITH THE LA OWES. COMMENTS THAT -- MAYBE WE OUGHTA. WAIT A YEAR ARE WITHOUT ALL THESE OTHER. PRESSING NEEDS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO US. TODAY -- AND WITH THIS BE TEN WHICH I WAS THE ONLY REPUBLICAN VOTER FORCE. AND I'VE. BEEN GETTING MY SPEED BAD ABOUT THAT BUT SINCE IT'S GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY WITH EVERYTHING SORT OF ON HOLD ANYWAY [inaudible] SO I'M. I'M SORT OF LEANING TOWARDS DAILYKOS POSITION. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GONNA BE A QUESTION -- I'M JUST JUST KIND OF MAKING AN OBSERVATION. SO IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND. HAPPY. YOU MAY OKAY. WE ARE WE ARE OPEN TO WORKING WITH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OF COURSE ON ENHANCING AND BEING CLEAR ON WHAT THE GOALS ARE WHAT DIRECTIVES ARE -- THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO BE FUNDED. AND THEN ALSO THE EVALUATION I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE HAVE -- ALREADY BEEN THINKING ABOUT ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW IT IS THAT WE'RE GONNA STRUCTURED SO THAT WE CAN GET THE DATA THAT IS NEEDED. TO MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKING INTERNAL RETURN IN TERMS OF RETURN TO WORK PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND THEN AND THEN ALSO POTENTIAL BIAS WE ARE HAPPY CAN YOU WORK WITH -- WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PART THAT'S ON THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. BERMAN FINANCE AND YOU WANT TO COMMENT -- YOU KNOW I THINK THE THE PRE TRIAL LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA IS EVER CHANGING -- AND I THINK THIS INVESTMENT THAT WE'VE MADE WILL HELP US BE READY FOR WHEN AND IF THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS -- AND DOES THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL MENTIONED YOU KNOW WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE PRIDE IN PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION THE CHIEF PUT TOGETHER THE WORK GROUP AND THEY'RE WORKING ON MORE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT HAPPY TO CONTINUE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO STAFF AND THE LEO. COMMENT I WOULD MAKE ABOUT THAT AND I'M SURE SENATOR BILL HAS SOME IS THAT [inaudible] WHILE. WELL WE DON'T KNOW. WHAT -- WILL HAPPEN NEXT EITHER LEGISLATIVELY OR BY VOTERS. IT IS CERTAINLY. I'M INDEPENDENT OF ANY OF THAT. HOW A ANY PARTICULAR JUDGE OR COURT? DETERMINES WHETHER BILLS NECESSARY AND WHAT LEVEL OF IT IS IS WITHIN [inaudible] OUR DISCRETION [inaudible] AND SO. I THINK WHAT REGARDLESS AGAIN OF ANY OF THESE OTHER. THINGS THAT ARE IN THE EITHER I'M. IF WE FIND SUCH A PILOT WE ARE GOING. ART AGAIN OUR OBJECTIVE. OUR OBJECTIVE. FOR WHAT WE'VE ESTABLISHED SO FAR. AMBER WHAT WE'RE PRACTICING SO FAR WAS ON IT THREE OF PROTECTING THE PUBLIC. AND AND SO WHAT WE'D WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE. THAT AND STEP BACK IN WE FACE WE HAVE OVER TIME. I APPRECIATED THAT. IN THE DESIGN OF THAT SYSTEM OR THE PRACTICE OF THAT SYSTEM THERE IS BEEN BIAS. AND IT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND IT IS ALSO INCREASED OUR COSTS BECAUSE WE'VE PERHAPS HELP PEOPLE. INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE HELP PEOPLE. FOR THAT WE DIDN'T NEED TO OR FOR LONGER THAN WE NEEDED TO AND OF COURSE THAT'S A COST -- AND SO HOW DO WE IMPROVE THAT AND CLEARLY THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS PART OF AFFECTED RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS IS PART OF THAT IMPROVING SO IT IS WITH IT IS. TOTALLY IN OUR INTEREST TO IMPROVE THAT PROCESS REGARDLESS OF ANYTHING ELSE. AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT FINDING A PILOT I WANT TO HELP I WANT. TO WE CAN NEVER BE ASSURED BUT I WANT. TO FEEL THAT IT'S DESIGNED APPROPRIATELY TO GIVE US SOME OUTCOMES WE CAN LAND ON THAT HELP GUIDE US IN THE NEXT. DIRECTIONS AROUND OUR PRACTICES. WELCOME TO COMMENT IF YOU LIKE. WE LIVE WE AGREE. ABSOLUTELY MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND ALSO -- QUICK DECISION MAKING -- ARE AND RETURN TO COURT R. I. AND AND ALL THE WHILE REDUCING BIAS IS IS INTEGRAL TO THE SYSTEM AND IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT THAT. THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT RIGHT. YES. YEAH AND AND I THINK LIKE THE LA -- WHEN I READ THE ITEM TO AT LEAST TO DATE? NAME -- USED. US SENATOR BREAUX. I HAVE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THAN. BUT TWO YEARS AGO I INTRODUCED A BILL -- SP EIGHT THE VERSION OF THE DEALT WITH -- INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES -- I DISCOVERED BY LOOKING AT COUNTY JAIL RECORDS SO -- WITH -- MENTAL ILLNESS. FOR THE SAME CRIME. GENERALLY WERE IN JAIL LONGER. JUDGES SHAKING HIS HEAD -- I NOTE FOR THE RECORD -- LONGER THAN SOMEBODY. IN JAIL FOR THE SAME CRIME -- IF YOU HAVE A MILLION US YOU'RE IN JAIL FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. THEREBY THERE BY HAVING A BIAS -- OR DISCRIMINATION IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT THAT WAY FOR SOMEBODY. THAT HAS A BILL ILLNESS IN JAIL BECAUSE OF THE DETERMINATION OF PAPARAZZI AND HOW TO HANDLE -- AND SO FOR SO. AS A RESULT OF THAT -- BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT. IN ADDITION. TO BE ADVISED AGAINST SOMEBODY WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- BEEN IN. JAIL OR PRISON LONGER. SAME THING APPLIES -- TO PRISON BY THE WAY THERE. IN THERE LONGER FOR THE SAME CRIME BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TREATED IN THE JAILS PRISONS ADEQUATELY SO THEY DON'T BEHAVE EXACTLY. NORMAL WAY AND THEREFORE THERE. THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO PUNISH PEOPLE THAT. DON'T BEHAVE CORRECT AND THE TURNING THEIR COMPETENCY FOR TRIAL IN. THAT LEGAL PROCESS TAKES TIME -- HAVING SPECIALIZED EVALUATIONS TAKES TIME. OF ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS LEAD. TO WHAT I CONSIDERED THIS TO BE A VIOLATION OF THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS IN THE SENSE OF THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT WHICH IS STERILE. EQUAL TREATMENT OKAY. SO I INTRODUCES THE BILL. SB EIGHT THERE WITH STARSHIP PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM. FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND BE ABLE -- TO A TRIAL HAVE CONFERENCES IN THE JUDGE'S CHAMBERS WE HAVE. PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED TO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS. AND HAVE CONFERENCES TO DIVERT THEM. TO TREATMENT PROGRAMS. IN A CONDITIONAL WAY WHEREBY THEY WOULD -- BE ABLE -- TO GO TO THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AND HAVE AN ABILITY -- TO RECEIVE THE TREATMENT AND AND IF THE JUDGE WAS SO INCLINED AFTER SEEING SATISFACTORY PROGRESS REPORTS. THEN HAVE AN ABILITY. TO A RACE ANY RECORDS OR EXPUNGE ANY RECORDS OF THE PERSONS -- CRIME THAT THEY WERE CHARGED WITH ORIGINALLY CHARGED WITH -- TALKED ABOUT SO. THAT BILL -- IT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT WAS A LOT OF WORK WE DO A LOT OF WORK ON IT. IT DIED IN THE ASSEMBLY -- APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE RIGHT IN. AND THEN WE RE INTRODUCED IT -- TO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS SP. TWO FIFTEEN S. S. B. -- TWO FIFTEEN HAD A VERSION THAT WENT THROUGH WE MADE IT WE WE WORKED OUT SO. SOME ISSUES WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IT WENT THROUGH THE PROCESS IT HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I DON'T. HE WAS UNOPPOSED I BELIEVE ON A POST. AND THEN JUST TO CONTINUE THE STORY. ALSO WE HAD A PRE TRIAL A GROUP OF PROGRAMS EVERYBODY AGREED ON AND ABOUT MAY OF LAST YEAR. THEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES BUDGET HE PUT. IN HIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL AB. EIGHTEEN TEN A PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM THE SAME AS SP TWO FIFTEEN EXCEPT CLUE THE MURDER RAPE AND SEX CRIMES REMEMBER THIS [inaudible] AND SO -- THAT TRAILER BILL. WAS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS THIS KIND OF DONE WITHOUT GOING TO OUR COMMITTEE OR ANYTHING IT JUST KIND OF I DON'T REMEMBER THIS THIS. EVERYBODY REMEMBERS IT NOW I WAS QUITE WITH SO WE HAD TO SPEND A LOT TIME. CLEANING THAT UP SO I I ACTUALLY AMENDED SP. TWO FIFTEEN TO DO A CLEAN UP OF THE GOVERNOR'S. TRAILER BILL ALL. AND THE TRAILER BUT AN SP TWO FIFTEEN EVENTUALLY WAS ADOPTED AND THE LAW -- REMOVING [inaudible] OF MANSLAUGHTER MURDER RAPE AND SEX CRIMES FROM THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND REQUIRES COURTS TO CONDUCT HEARINGS. UNREST IF ANY RESTITUTION WAS -- THAT WE WANTED TO HAVE THE RESTITUTION. YOU KNOW PROCESS IS PART OF IT BECAUSE THAT'S A GOOD PROCESS TO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE [inaudible] APPROACH. SO WHEN I HEAR ABOUT. NOW DOING A HI THE ON PRE TRIAL. AFTER HAVING SPENT TWO YEARS WORKING ON THIS BILL HEALTH THING MY QUESTION IS ARE YOU IMPLEMENTING THE MILL HEALTH THING. IS THIS BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY THE COURTS AND WHY DO WE NEED A PRE TRIAL. PILOT PROGRAM [inaudible] AT ALL. OF WE CAN JUST EXPAND WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. IN PRE TRIAL THE COURTS EVERYBODY AGREED TO THE CONCEPT THAT WE DEVELOPED. THROUGH THAT WHY CAN'T WE JUST EXPAND WHEN WE NEED A SIR LIKE. FOR JU THE I I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO DO A PILOT I DON'T WANT TO DO A PILOT I WANT TO JUST STICKS. TO EXPAND THE THE PROGRAMS THAT WE ALREADY IS ESTABLISHED WITH THIS WITH THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL IN THE STATUTE. THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR AND THERE WERE SOME OTHER STATUTES. ON FREE TRIAL. PROGRAM SO WHY CAN'T WE JUST. MOVE TO MOVE THIS ALONG ---I DON'T MIND YOU STUDYING OR ANALYSING ROLE RATHER THE COST MONEY US BUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO DO A PILOT PROGRAM. NO I DON'T THINK SO I WANT -- TO I I WANT -- TO THE LAW THAT WE ESTABLISHED -- IF YOU WANTED TO SUIT INSTITUTED MORE FULLY -- ESTABLISH SHOULD BE IN A STRONGER WAY THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA -- LOS ANGELES COUNTY. IS NOW. GOING TO A THEY DECIDE NOT TO BUILD ANOTHER PRISON. AND THEY WANT TO HAVE. PROGRAMS [inaudible] FOR PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. THAT WILL TAKE PLACE -- WE VOTERS APPROVED PROPOSITION. TWO NO PLACE LIKE HOME BONDS. THOSE WILL PROVIDE SOME SORT OF HOUSING ANALYST. PROPOSITION ONE WHICH HE I WAS ABOVE THE THAT WAS. THE BOND. THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME SORT OF HOUSING. FINDS A PROGRAM. SO IT SEEMS LIKE IT SEEMS LIKE. NOW THAT WE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PUT MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR HOUSING. I TAKE A CHECK WHY DON'T WE JUST. THIS. VERSION PROGRAM. THAT WE CAN START TO HAVE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. IN TWO OF THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND HAVE. THE PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAM IT. FOR FULL WEIGHT NOW THAT THE WHAT. WORKS SO HARD TO GET ALL THAT HOUSING LINED UP BECAUSE THAT WAS THE BOTTOM RIGHT. NOT NOT HAVING A PLACE FOR THE PERSON -- TO GET TREATMENT. WAS THE BOTTLENECK AND BY THE WAY. IF WE HAVE THESE TREATMENT PROGRAMS HAVE TO MONEY COMES AT A KELSO. SO IT'S A IT'S A BARGAIN AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING UP. AFTER SPENDING TWO YEARS ON THIS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IMPLEMENTING WHAT WE ALREADY DID AND TIED IT INTO THOSE THAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING I THINK WE'RE WE THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN WE WANT THESE PROGRAMS. YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAD PROPOSITION. THIRTY SIX FORTY SEVEN SEVEN THE PLACE LIKE HOME PROPOSITION -- ONE YOU KNOW LET'S LET'S GET GOING YOU'RE THE VOTERS EXPRESSES TO MOVE FAST. ANYWAY THAT'S MY OR ENTER BOTH YOU KNOW MY BEFORE. YOU ANSWER RESPOND I THINK YOUR ARM IS BETTER BOWLER ARE VERY. LEGITIMATE B. M.. AND CERTAINLY PRE TRIAL DIVERSION PROGRAMS AS YOU DESCRIBE AND THAT IS YOU IN CAPS LATED NSP FIFTEEN AND OTHERS. ARE POTENTIALLY PART OF THIS. BUT THIS THE ITEM WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS PILOT I THINK WHAT WE MIGHT WANT TO HEAR FROM THEM IT'S IT'S DESCRIBED. WELL THERE IS LANGUAGE AROUND. THE BEST IS IN. IN. IN GENERAL. THERE'S ALSO VERY SPEECH. LANGUAGE. VERSION IS CLEARLY. NOT ONLY BUT IS BEING APPLIED AND WE HAVE MANY -- PROGRAMS LIKE FIFTEEN ARE BEING APPLIED WHERE WE'VE YOUR THAT. WE MAY OPT TO NOT EVEN TO BRING THE PERSON HOLY. BREIL ANOTHER WORDS IT'S NOT JUST A PRE TRIAL DIVERSION IT'S ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY TRYING TO AVOID THE PERSON EVEN BEING DEALT WITH WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE THIS. AND THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS BRIEF FILED ITS DECISION MAKING PILOTS ARE MORE AROUND THOSE. INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO WE'RE GOING TO ASSUME ARE GOING TO GO TO TRIAL. BUT HOW DO WE HANDLE. YEAH IN TERMS OF BEFORE. THEY GO TO TRIAL WE HOLD THEM. OR DO WE RELEASE THEM AND HOW DO WE ASSURE PUBLIC SAFETY IN THAT AND SO -- I WANTED JUST TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION AS I THINK IT IS YOUR POINT IS LEGITIMATE THAT IT'S NOT. CLEAR IN THE PILOT. HOW MUCH DO WE WOULD BE ASKED BEING OR VALUE WAITING THINGS THAT ARE ARE OUT [inaudible] THAT. VISION MAKING PROCESS THOSE WERE OUR YES YOU MEAN ARE GONNA GO. ONLY TO TRIAL. VERSES. TYPE OF DIVERSION PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IS ELECTED -- KIND OF LIKE [inaudible] BETTER. SHOW ME HOW YOU'RE IN FAST. I WRITE WHAT I WRITE. AND I WILL. AN ERA AND I I PERSONALLY THINK THAT. WE NEED TO EXPAND THE LAW TO COVER OTHER AREAS. WELL HEALTH IS LOCAL. THAT'S A BIG BIG PART OF IT. EVERYBODY. I WILL LET OUR FOLKS ANSWER THAT BUT I ALSO IN TALKING TO OUR STATS MIGHT. I THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A ITEM WHERE WE JUST TALK ABOUT IT. PROGRAMS AS THE IT ISN'T. YOU KNOW WE MAY WANT TO GET INTO THIS -- I'M STAFF AND I JUST. NOTICED THAT IT WILL BE IN ONE OF OUR BUT I DO WANT YOU TO ANSWER BUT WE MAY. BUT LET'S NOT DO A PILOT. I I I WOULD SAY -- CENTRE BELL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'M. MAYBE EIGHTEEN TEN THE ABILITY REFERENCE I CAN SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT THE THE PORTS NOW ARE IN THE PROCESS OF OFMANY A BEATING AND WE AT THE DISTRICT COUNCIL HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF WEBINARS ASSIST THE PORTS TO MOVE FORWARD ON THAT. WE ALSO ARE HAVING TO IN PERSON WELL HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE IN MAY DOWN AND STAND FOR AND YOU KNOW IN ORDER TO BRING THE LOCAL JUSTICE SYSTEM PARTNERS -- WHO ARE WHO ARE MOST -- THE THE BIGGEST USERS OF THE STATE HOSPITALS TOGETHER ABOUT BEST PRACTICES IN WAYS THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY AND HE FELT. THAT WE ARE IN AGREEMENT VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS DUE IN RECOGNIZING THAT MANY PEOPLE. OUR JUSTICE INVOLVED -- ARE ARE ALSO SUFFER FROM THEM OR HAVE HAVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THAT THAT WE COULD BE. ADDRESSING MOR EFFECTIVELY AND WE ARE RIGHT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THAT. I THINK THIS PROGRAM IS A CENTER AS THE CHAIR -- MENTIONED IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IN THAT IT'S GOING TO ADDRESS ALL THE TRIAL MATTER -- AND IT'S AND IT'S A MUCH OF IT MUCH OF THE OLD IS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING AT THE TIME OF ARREST. UP UNTIL PRE ARRANGEMENT RIGHT AND AND AND WHEN THEY GET TENS OF PEOPLE BEING DETAINED -- BEFORE RAIMENT THAT ARE THERE ARE THERE WAYS. WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND SEND IT? ALRIGHT HONEY IS THAT A MODEL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS THAT THE RESOURCES WHERE THEY ARE HAPPEN THAT IT. AND DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE THE WHOLE IDEA OF THIS PROJECT IS TO GO DEEPER RECOGNIZING ANIMAL LIKE IMPLEMENTING THIS WEEK AND AND THAT. IS ON BUT OTHER THINGS ARE HAPPENING. RE TILE RIGHT NOW JUST LAST WEEK WE HAD TWO SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS THAT HAPPENED BOTH IN THE IN THE STATE COURT -- AND IN THE FEDERAL COURT AS IT RELATES TO THE TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA. THINGS ARE REALLY SHIPPING AS AS B. O. F. MENTIONED ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS -- AND WHAT THIS IS DOING IS THIS IS GONNA ALLOW US TO REALLY CONTINUE TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION. TO A DEEP DIVE AND SELL IF AND WHEN THE TRIAL HAPPENS BECAUSE LIKE MOST PEOPLE AGREE THAT THE TRIAL IS NOT GONNA LOOK THE WAY IT DOES NOW. WE DON'T KNOW DEFINITIVELY WHAT IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE BUT THIS IS ALLOWING US TO PLANT THE SEEDS -- MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE PRACTICES THAT ARE TESTED AND THAT WORK IN ME YEAH. BUT WHAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT DRESSES I I UNDERSTAND. SENATOR BILL'S CONCERN IS THAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT A PILOT TO TEST. PRE DIVERSION PROGRAMS WE'VE ALREADY AUTHORIZED AND I AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THESE CONFUSIONS ABOUT THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS. AND SO. I AGREE WITH SENATOR BELL I DON'T. I'M NOT READY TO GO AND SPEND MONEY ON TESTING SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ALREADY. TEAM THAT WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED WITH. HOWEVER I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TEST A FOR ANOTHER SET OF THINGS THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING RIGHT. AND SO SOME CLARITY WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS AGAIN WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE I KNOW HOW MUCH MORE APPRECIATE. WHY SENATOR BILL BROUGHT RAISED HIS CONCERN [inaudible] I THINK [inaudible] LAST. I THINK THAT [inaudible] RIGHT -- THAT'S WHY [inaudible] SURE [inaudible] WELL. THANK YOU HEARD SOME OF THE YEAH. ALL I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE WILL WE WE RAISE UP. EXTENSIVE ENOUGH NOT. WE WILL WE WILL GO BACK AND WORK WITH OUR THE NEW THE CHEATS NEW WORKGROUP -- WORK WITH THEM. WORK WITH A FINANCE AND AND YOUR STAFF I'M I'M UP WITH LANGUAGE THAT WILL PROVIDE SOME. OUR OBJECTIVES ARE ARE THE SAME. RETURN TO WORK MINIMIZING BIAS THAT'S I POPULATION [inaudible] OUT BACK. AND WE WILL ALSO I'M. ONE OF YOUR OF EMPLOYMENT. EIGHT YEAH WE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS pAPPRECIATE. BEING ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY AND AND FOR THE COMMENTS -- FROM YOU -- MADAM CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS. WE SEE THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT -- I AREA FOR THE STAY AND AS WAS DISCUSSED HERE WE KNOW THAT THEIR CURRENT. CURRENTLY IS CASE LAW IN THIS AREA AND SO IMPACTS TO THE SYSTEM ARE ALREADY HAPPENING CHANGES ARE ALREADY HAPPENING -- AND WE THINK. THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE REALLY THAT WE COLLECTIVELY ACT ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE THINGS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY ARE ADDRESSED. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE PARK WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON A PRE TRIAL THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DEVELOPING PROGRAMS BOTH THAT ARE. RESPONSIVE TO LOCAL NEEDS BUT THAT ARE ALSO REFLECTIVE OF ALL OF THE VALUES THAT YOU MENTIONED AND THAT -- BRINGS A DEGREE OF UNIFORMITY -- TO THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND SAID THOSE ARE VALUES AND THINGS THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. TO PROBATION AND I KNOW I KNOW OUR SYSTEM PARTNERS AS WELL -- TOWARD THAT END I SEE PARKING DID -- JUST RECENTLY PUT TOGETHER -- I'LL BE TRIAL TOOL KIT ON THAT WE WORKED VERY VERY CLOSELY WITH IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PRE TRIAL JUSTICE INSTITUTE WHICH IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED EXPERT IN THIS AREA. REALLY TO HELP GUIDE BEST PRACTICES AND TO GIVE KIND OF ON A ROAD MAP -- TO COUNTIES AGAIN IN OUR OUR WHARTON COUNTY IT SHOULD BE AND MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS. I THINK ALL UNDER THE HEADER OF THE VERY THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS TALKED ABOUT ON WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT IS STRUCTURED IN A WAY AGAIN THAT THERE IS -- REFLECTIVE OF WHAT WE WANT IT TO BE -- AND ALSO -- AGAIN LOOKING AT BEST PRACTICES AND AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE -- PROBATION MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE -- ARE CURRENTLY -- DUTIES AND THINGS THAT FALL WITHIN OUR MISSION -- FROM FROM WORKING ON ASSESSMENTS I'M DOING SOME OF THE MONITORING AND SUPERVISION AND SO -- WITH PROBATION KIND OF BEING THIS THIS LYNCH PEN BETWEEN -- OUR COURT PARTNERS ARE COUNTY PARTNERS STATE AND LOCAL -- AND AND THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SYSTEM DONE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK AND AND SO AS THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS BOARD ALONG WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND THE ADMINISTRATION WE CERTAINLY HOPE TO BE A PART OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WE THINK AGAIN THIS IS A VERY. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE I THINK THERE ARE SOME GREAT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THERE AGAIN TO MAKE SURE THAT WORK ON PROVIDING THE RIGHT TYPES OF SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY MAKING THE RIGHT TYPES OF RISK BASED DECISIONS. I'M GOING FORWARD SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU.
